[00:00:03.931 --> 00:00:07.174]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:15.742]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.403 --> 00:00:17.464]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.164 --> 00:00:19.285]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:20.747]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:22.428]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:26.832]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.253 --> 00:00:29.595]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:31.337]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.557 --> 00:00:36.460]  And good day, this is Michael Corbin filling in for Alex Jones, who will return tomorrow.
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.081]  Wow, what a day.
[00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:44.424]  And as Alex has predicted, and we talked with him yesterday, well, it's official.
[00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:47.766]  Arnold Schwarzenegger is now the governor of California.
[00:00:48.407 --> 00:00:49.367]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:00:50.468 --> 00:00:51.208]  What a mess!
[00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:54.971]  Anyway, you've got to go check out InfoWars.com today.
[00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:57.132]  Definitely check out InfoWars.com because
[00:00:57.794 --> 00:01:13.400]  The true nature of the identity of this man is really starting to spill out and Alex has compiled a lot of information on InfoWars.com which again you've got to check out today to find out who this man really is.
[00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.282]  Interesting link that is on InfoWars.com to Matt Drudge's website.
[00:01:19.882 --> 00:01:26.285]  Drudge has an interesting article about Schwarzenegger and being
[00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.501]  He was a nude model for Mapplethorpe, for Robert Mapplethorpe.
[00:01:32.682 --> 00:01:35.202]  And this tells you a lot.
[00:01:35.622 --> 00:01:39.524]  It tells you a considerable amount because who was Robert Mapplethorpe?
[00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:45.546]  Mapplethorpe was a pervert, a very sick pervert, who was in New York.
[00:01:45.566 --> 00:01:50.107]  We're going to hear a little bit about him today anyway in our interview with my guest coming up here in a little bit.
[00:01:50.527 --> 00:01:55.169]  But Mapplethorpe was a photographer who lived in New York and
[00:01:56.308 --> 00:02:09.213]  A man who was involved in some very, very dark, dark, insidious, evil things, including a peripheral involvement with the son of Sam, which is again what we're going to talk about today.
[00:02:09.913 --> 00:02:22.337]  But what's even more telling is that Mapplethorpe was a homosexual who was in that circuit in New York City during those days when all that stuff was going crazy out there.
[00:02:23.397 --> 00:02:25.258]  And he did photographs.
[00:02:25.318 --> 00:02:26.759]  He did compiled photographs.
[00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.480]  He shot photographs of some pretty twisted, sick things.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.801]  Including one thing that he called the Piss Christ.
[00:02:33.162 --> 00:02:38.604]  And that was one of the things that really, really put him on the map internationally.
[00:02:38.664 --> 00:02:40.625]  But the guy was a sick, twisted pervert.
[00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:47.388]  But anyway, according to Drudge's investigation of him, Arnold Schwarzenegger
[00:02:48.375 --> 00:03:17.175]  posed for nude photographs uh... by him and uh... we're talking about full nude photographs uh... and uh... just reading a little bit from the drudge's uh... report here says the shocking nudes of republican schwarzenegger have been kept under lock at the estate of robert mapplethorpe in new york now mapplethorpe whose infamous self-portrait with a bull whip inserted in his anus as well as many photographs of penises and men engaging in homosexual acts considered schwarzenegger one of his favorite subjects
[00:03:17.636 --> 00:03:22.307]  Now those come from sources close to the late artist, and they were telling this to Matt Drudge.
[00:03:22.608 --> 00:03:23.851]  That is just the tip!
[00:03:24.745 --> 00:03:27.146]  ...of the iceberg of who this guy really, really is.
[00:03:27.986 --> 00:03:38.908]  Of course, according to InfoWars.com too, the New World Order elite has big plans for this guy, and he is now officially the Governor-Elect of California.
[00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.969]  Gray Davis is on his way out.
[00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:52.912]  There's also a link on there to a 1976 interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, where Arnold said he dreamed of being a dictator and controlling large groups of people.
[00:03:52.952 --> 00:03:54.172]  Kind of sounds like the President!
[00:03:54.952 --> 00:03:57.313]  Kind of sounds like they all kind of travel in the same camp.
[00:03:57.693 --> 00:04:03.576]  And speaking of that, there's also an article on there about George W. and his Nazi connections.
[00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:06.997]  You see, this is all starting to come out to the surface now.
[00:04:07.337 --> 00:04:08.658]  It's all starting to leak out.
[00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:11.479]  Their game is now in the public venue.
[00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:12.179]  It's in our face.
[00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.180]  And I wonder what we're going to do about it.
[00:04:15.361 --> 00:04:16.381]  It's really, really crazy.
[00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:17.742]  It's really, really nuts.
[00:04:18.602 --> 00:04:20.583]  And then they, uh, let's see here.
[00:04:21.874 --> 00:04:28.200]  I'm reading from a quote from ABC News that Arnold wrote in his 1975 book, Proposal for Pumping Iron.
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:35.666]  Quote, I admired Hitler, for instance, because he came from being a little man with almost no formal education up to power.
[00:04:36.186 --> 00:04:39.909]  I admire him for being such a good public speaker and for what he did with it.
[00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:50.218]  And he went on to say that he would have liked to be like Hitler in the Nuremberg Stadium and have all those people scream at you and just being total agreement in whatever you say.
[00:04:51.354 --> 00:04:55.356]  This is the guy that's now the governor of California, and there's other things coming out with this.
[00:04:55.717 --> 00:04:58.258]  Stay tuned, there's more coming up on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:58.618 --> 00:04:59.319]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.399]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:00.860]  I'm Michael Corbin, we'll be right back.
[00:05:10.186 --> 00:05:12.928]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[00:05:13.168 --> 00:05:19.493]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[00:05:19.793 --> 00:05:25.697]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them, but still have them safe and sound?
[00:05:26.137 --> 00:05:29.900]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax-exempt?
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.161]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[00:05:32.401 --> 00:05:33.262]  Well, there is a way.
[00:05:33.522 --> 00:05:39.606]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:50.253]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years, and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[00:05:50.313 --> 00:05:51.113]  Constitution.
[00:05:51.393 --> 00:05:53.014]  You don't have to go offshore to do it, either.
[00:05:53.294 --> 00:05:55.596]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[00:05:56.056 --> 00:06:03.761]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:08.803]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[00:06:10.064 --> 00:06:14.427]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:14.587 --> 00:06:19.069]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.532]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[00:06:23.632 --> 00:06:24.933]  A New World Order.
[00:06:25.673 --> 00:06:26.054]  Can emerge.
[00:06:26.715 --> 00:06:30.919]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:37.927]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:38.047 --> 00:06:40.050]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:50.778]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:51.058 --> 00:06:56.422]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:07:13.174 --> 00:07:16.675]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:35.403]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:07:35.823 --> 00:07:41.166]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.

[00:08:14.664 --> 00:08:15.304]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.965 --> 00:08:17.025]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.746 --> 00:08:18.846]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.506 --> 00:08:20.307]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.067 --> 00:08:21.988]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.648 --> 00:08:26.410]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:29.171]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:08:30.059 --> 00:08:30.900]  Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.522 --> 00:08:39.139]  And again, I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones who has been out in Los Angeles covering the dog and pony show known as the Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.891]  A bid for governorship.
[00:08:41.691 --> 00:08:42.331]  A governator.
[00:08:43.272 --> 00:08:44.993]  Or as Alex called him, the Apollinator.
[00:08:45.013 --> 00:08:49.695]  And indeed, this guy is really a piece of work.
[00:08:49.775 --> 00:08:53.217]  This guy is a real twisted guy.
[00:08:53.917 --> 00:08:59.660]  And I love listening to him, you know, talking about how he wants to work for the people of California.
[00:09:00.161 --> 00:09:00.781]  Yeah, right.
[00:09:01.301 --> 00:09:01.942]  So, anyway.
[00:09:03.763 --> 00:09:09.167]  We're going to have an update from Alex today at some point on the finale of that whole thing.
[00:09:09.868 --> 00:09:19.375]  As you know from the last couple of days, Alex has come in with special reports about what was going on out there, the mood and the whole climate in California.
[00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:23.739]  And of course, as we all know now, Arnold Schwarzenegger is now Governor-Elect.
[00:09:24.703 --> 00:09:31.986]  Gray Davis is out and now the game, well I shouldn't say now the game begins because the game's already afoot, it's been in play.
[00:09:32.646 --> 00:09:34.047]  This is just the next level of it.
[00:09:34.147 --> 00:09:46.152]  So, you know, and as you heard yesterday with Matt, not Matt Drudge, but with Greg Pallast, when he was on the program talking about the nine billion dollar Enron secret that he has, it's going to be interesting to see how this all plays itself out.
[00:09:47.052 --> 00:09:52.094]  But you just can't help but get that feeling that, you know, something even worse now, I mean,
[00:09:53.044 --> 00:09:59.026]  The lesser two evils may have been Gray Davis, but now that Schwarzenegger's in, it's going to be interesting to see where that really goes.
[00:09:59.146 --> 00:09:59.426]  Okay.
[00:10:00.287 --> 00:10:16.952]  Now, we have got quite a lineup today, and it's kind of interesting because, as I mentioned with the Drudge Report thing, Mapplethorpe has taken photographs, new photographs, of Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others, and who knows what, but Mapplethorpe had quite a background, and
[00:10:19.409 --> 00:10:27.592]  We're going to be talking today, our focus on the program today is going to be some of these criminal cabals, mind control.
[00:10:27.632 --> 00:10:42.897]  I know Alex, even in Police State 3, the video that you need to get a copy of, he talks about white slavery, child pornography, the whole thing that surrounds all of these people, if you will, that you hear about.
[00:10:43.457 --> 00:10:47.078]  But we're going to have three very interesting guests today.
[00:10:47.739 --> 00:10:55.398]  The first one is a retired New York City police detective who was involved in numerous high-profile cases in the state of New York.
[00:10:56.264 --> 00:11:01.626]  And he is, for a closer look, he is our criminal justice specialist.
[00:11:02.326 --> 00:11:04.527]  A very, very qualified man.
[00:11:04.847 --> 00:11:09.628]  Someone who, as I said, as I mentioned, has been involved in some very high-profile cases.
[00:11:09.929 --> 00:11:11.849]  He's a very, very good investigator.
[00:11:12.249 --> 00:11:19.352]  Currently devotes his life, in retirement, currently devotes his life to finding, locating, missing and exploited children.
[00:11:19.392 --> 00:11:23.013]  And by God, you're going to find out how big of a problem this really is.
[00:11:24.134 --> 00:11:36.544]  You know, the mainstream media and the law enforcement agencies at the federal level will tend to downplay the significance of the number of children that are turning up missing in this country every year.
[00:11:37.265 --> 00:11:45.772]  Coming up on the second hour, we're going to be joined by Noreen Gosch, who is the mother of a child that was kidnapped back in the 80s.
[00:11:46.192 --> 00:11:47.934]  He was 12 years old when he was taken.
[00:11:49.790 --> 00:12:05.269]  Her story is extremely interesting from the standpoint that this child was kidnapped and was forced into a mind control cult, if you will, and was used as a prostitute, among other things.
[00:12:05.962 --> 00:12:08.025]  And he still has not been able to come home.
[00:12:08.065 --> 00:12:10.208]  She published a book called Why Johnny Can't Come Home.
[00:12:10.569 --> 00:12:11.490]  We're going to get to that, too.
[00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:15.555]  During the third hour, we're going to be joined by author Maury Terry.
[00:12:16.056 --> 00:12:21.564]  Now, Maury Terry, his name became almost household back in the 80s.
[00:12:22.845 --> 00:12:27.227]  I'm sorry, in the 70s, with the Son of Sam case in New York.
[00:12:27.287 --> 00:12:40.474]  And you may remember that David Berkowitz, who is now serving three consecutive life prison sentences in New York, who claimed at first that he was instructed by a demonic dog to perpetrate several killings in the New York area.
[00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:58.483]  As it turns out, Berkowitz was part of a large satanic coven, and we're going to hear about that investigation and how a lot of these things that we're going to be talking about today, how they all link up, because believe it or not, there are very, very serious, and I want to say serious, there are very, very serious connections
[00:12:59.604 --> 00:13:08.129]  To political figures and men, movers and shakers, affluent people, not only in the United States, but this is an international problem.
[00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:15.454]  And we're talking about, you know, murder, we're talking about Satanism, pedophilia, prostitution, and drugs.
[00:13:16.474 --> 00:13:17.415]  And it's going to surprise you.
[00:13:17.475 --> 00:13:19.156]  So that's what we're going to be doing today.
[00:13:19.176 --> 00:13:20.517]  And again, our number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:20.537 --> 00:13:20.597]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:20.617 --> 00:13:22.638]  Now, let's get to my first guest.
[00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:42.314]  He is, as I mentioned, a retired New York City police detective, and he has done many years investigating crimes that deal with vice, and currently is in retirement.
[00:13:42.374 --> 00:13:47.236]  He is a Closer Looks criminal justice specialist, and it's a pleasure to work with him.
[00:13:47.996 --> 00:13:50.697]  And I'm pleased to introduce him to the program today.
[00:13:50.737 --> 00:13:52.898]  Good morning, Jim, and thanks for being with us on the program.
[00:13:53.138 --> 00:13:53.958]  Good morning, Michael.
[00:13:53.978 --> 00:13:55.719]  It's always a pleasure to do a show with you.
[00:13:55.879 --> 00:13:56.959]  I enjoy doing it with you, too.
[00:13:57.586 --> 00:13:59.527]  Let's frame for the audience now.
[00:13:59.727 --> 00:14:01.308]  You heard the lineup we're going to have today.
[00:14:01.328 --> 00:14:03.048]  We're going to have Noreen Gosch and Maury Terry on.
[00:14:03.909 --> 00:14:13.373]  Basically, as I said, the focus of today's program, I want to look at the dynamics of how, you know, in other words, we're going to start with the missing children thing.
[00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:20.196]  And I want to talk about some of the cases that you've been involved in and how they connected to a bigger picture.
[00:14:21.198 --> 00:14:22.239]  Okay, I'm ready to go.
[00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:35.410]  Alright, well let's start with the notion of satanic cults that have a large involvement in some of the crimes that we hear about in the news today.
[00:14:36.071 --> 00:14:37.772]  Well, this goes back quite a ways.
[00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:45.039]  In fact, at first when I started investigating this in the late 60s, early 70s, we had no clue what we were looking at.
[00:14:46.099 --> 00:14:53.183]  And we also knew that at the time, the line of the government was that there is no such thing.
[00:14:53.844 --> 00:14:57.986]  And if you remember when the young man in Matamoros, Mexico was killed?
[00:14:58.266 --> 00:14:58.506]  Right.
[00:14:59.147 --> 00:15:04.890]  And it was interesting, one of the reporters there had heard me speak about some of the things to look for.
[00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.792]  In this particular case, it had to do with a cigar butt.
[00:15:08.385 --> 00:15:12.807]  With the teeth marks on the ash end of it which is used for cleansing the body.
[00:15:13.488 --> 00:15:16.509]  And that's how it came out that this was a satanic killing.
[00:15:16.529 --> 00:15:33.499]  Up to that point, the FBI had denied that any of this stuff was going on or there was anything like it when they in fact very well knew that this has been going on for many years because at the time we did the investigation we were working with some of their agents.
[00:15:34.676 --> 00:15:36.837]  So that was an official line that they were taking.
[00:15:36.897 --> 00:15:52.243]  For what reason, I can only guess that, but over the years, many times when they grab somebody that's involved, you'll see that the case gets investigated to a certain point and disappears.
[00:15:52.323 --> 00:15:59.505]  And many times there's a legitimate reason for that, because you want to use that information to continue your investigation.
[00:15:59.806 --> 00:16:00.006]  Right.
[00:16:00.066 --> 00:16:03.347]  But I have never ever seen anything happen after that level.
[00:16:04.299 --> 00:16:14.587]  For instance, the Gdusik case in Maryland, when he was arrested, a very well-known man, and I think he ended up doing a year and then disappeared.
[00:16:15.187 --> 00:16:21.552]  And what leads us back to him is that he came from the same area up in Yonkers where the Son of Sam case started.
[00:16:23.213 --> 00:16:28.637]  Now, one thing, too, I failed to mention when I was setting this whole program up today.
[00:16:29.511 --> 00:16:36.053]  The interesting thing is, and the relevance of what is going on today, and the focus, like I said, of the program is this.
[00:16:38.174 --> 00:16:52.599]  Karl Raschke, who wrote a book called Painted Black, I mentioned this yesterday on the program, I encouraged the listeners to get a copy of this, because this book basically kind of outlines, you know, our society today is living in fear over terrorism.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:17:02.946]  And it is very interesting, because a lot of these groups that are involved in these horrendous crimes are involved in terrorism.
[00:17:04.027 --> 00:17:11.031]  And the thing is, is that there is a direct, there is a linkage, I should say, between terrorist activities and criminal cabals.
[00:17:11.091 --> 00:17:16.974]  And for example, one of the things I want to read here is a quote from Karl Rasky about Satanism itself.
[00:17:17.695 --> 00:17:22.798]  And this kind of is very, very self-explanatory about what we're going to be talking about today.
[00:17:23.886 --> 00:17:26.408]  His definition of Satanism, he says, is not a new religion.
[00:17:26.488 --> 00:17:34.414]  He says it is a sophisticated and highly effective motivational system for the spread of violence and cultural terrorism.
[00:17:34.955 --> 00:17:42.581]  Satanism today is not, if it has ever been, a rejection of middle class values and a somewhat ingenious expression of chronic adolescent alienation.
[00:17:43.122 --> 00:17:47.806]  It is the gestation of a permanent terrorist subculture in America.
[00:17:47.826 --> 00:17:50.688]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:17:51.966 --> 00:17:56.488]  Well, Michael, that is the heart of the problem, right there.
[00:17:58.309 --> 00:18:07.753]  They have throughout these different cases, both in New York, California, with the Manson, and there are many cases that have never been revealed.
[00:18:08.073 --> 00:18:11.954]  And you'll find that if you follow this through, there are connections.
[00:18:12.214 --> 00:18:15.756]  Now, everybody, as soon as you say that, oh, here's another conspiracy nut,
[00:18:16.331 --> 00:18:19.334]  But, if it's more than two people, it is a conspiracy.
[00:18:28.109 --> 00:18:34.794]  Common knowledge when you travel through different parts of this country, and there is no part of this country that is not affected by it.
[00:18:35.054 --> 00:18:35.234]  Yeah.
[00:18:35.675 --> 00:18:37.156]  And these people know where to go.
[00:18:37.456 --> 00:18:46.022]  It's back in the 70s already where we followed both the male and female prostitution, which runs very closely with this here.
[00:18:46.323 --> 00:18:46.503]  Yeah.
[00:18:46.803 --> 00:18:54.289]  And that's why people in one part of the country must be aware of it, because if it's on the East Coast, it's on the West Coast.
[00:18:54.589 --> 00:18:54.789]  Right.
[00:18:55.598 --> 00:19:00.341]  You know, the thing is that we're going to be talking about again today, too, is the fact you just mentioned Charlie Manson.
[00:19:01.042 --> 00:19:19.154]  I think if you look back at some of this stuff, you'll begin to start seeing some common threads, and we're going to talk about that, not only with you, but also with Maury Terry today, what the common threads are between Charlie Manson, the son of Sam, and even the Atlanta child murders, the Jeffrey Dahmer himself.
[00:19:20.448 --> 00:19:23.632]  There are connections, and I think a lot of people do not even realize that.
[00:19:23.972 --> 00:19:24.853]  We're going to take a break.
[00:19:25.254 --> 00:19:28.137]  When we come back, we'll continue with my guest, Jim Rothstein.
[00:19:28.177 --> 00:19:29.178]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:29.198 --> 00:19:29.939]  Again, that number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:29.959 --> 00:19:32.342]  We're going to be discussing, also, the aesthetics of terror.
[00:19:40.757 --> 00:19:42.179]  We're going to find out just exactly.
[00:19:42.219 --> 00:19:44.681]  We've connected some dots here over the last couple of days.
[00:19:45.081 --> 00:19:48.965]  Number one being that terrorism is a lot of times state-sponsored.
[00:19:48.985 --> 00:19:52.429]  We're going to find out just how all this works at the Sub-Rosa level.
[00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:53.650]  Again, our number 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.551]  We'll be right back after this.
[00:20:10.342 --> 00:20:18.965]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:20:19.165 --> 00:20:30.449]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:30.669 --> 00:20:33.330]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:37.752]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[00:20:37.972 --> 00:20:40.114]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:20:40.274 --> 00:20:42.135]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:20:42.335 --> 00:20:48.360]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:54.304]  It's rechargeable, bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:20:54.604 --> 00:20:58.547]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-825-7000.
[00:21:01.169 --> 00:21:01.350]  803-4438.

[00:21:02.513 --> 00:21:03.416]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:10.353 --> 00:21:17.215]  As a listener to the Genesis Communications Network, you're aware of the many health dangers that have been unleashed upon an unsuspecting public.
[00:21:17.655 --> 00:21:24.796]  We all want to protect ourselves and our loved ones, but how do we do that without costly pharmaceutical products that trade benefits with side effects?
[00:21:25.256 --> 00:21:29.037]  Stabilized oxygen may be just the answer to this question and more.
[00:21:29.437 --> 00:21:36.819]  Stabilized oxygen is an oxidant similar to food-grade hydrogen peroxide, but it is more stable and effective with no unpleasant taste.
[00:21:37.239 --> 00:21:46.509]  By providing your bloodstream with molecular oxygen, it is possible to kill anaerobic bacteria and other parasites on contact without harming tissue or friendly bacteria.
[00:21:46.989 --> 00:21:50.513]  A 120-day supply of stabilized oxygen is just $15 post-pay.
[00:21:52.358 --> 00:22:02.264]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your four month supply and get the best oxygen boost available in easy to take droplet form.

[00:22:11.869 --> 00:22:16.152]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[00:22:16.572 --> 00:22:17.453]  It still is!
[00:22:18.053 --> 00:22:21.576]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[00:22:21.876 --> 00:22:23.678]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[00:22:24.238 --> 00:22:26.280]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[00:22:26.849 --> 00:22:28.871]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[00:22:29.252 --> 00:22:36.900]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.084]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[00:23:09.449 --> 00:23:14.293]  If you're losing your hair and haven't tried Avocor yet, how about a free month's supply?
[00:23:14.493 --> 00:23:18.816]  That's right, we're giving away a free month of Avocor with all of today's orders.
[00:23:19.117 --> 00:23:22.119]  You've heard all about Avocor on radio and TV for years.
[00:23:22.379 --> 00:23:27.063]  That's because Avocor is proven to successfully stop hair loss and regrow hair.
[00:23:27.483 --> 00:23:32.807]  Avocor has helped people just like you regain their youthful appearance with new healthy hair.
[00:23:33.027 --> 00:23:34.468]  So why haven't you called?
[00:23:34.729 --> 00:23:36.430]  We want you to try Avocor.
[00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:41.316]  We know that once your hair stops falling out and starts to regrow, you'll be glad you did.
[00:23:41.656 --> 00:23:42.517]  Still not convinced?
[00:23:42.797 --> 00:23:45.841]  Avocor comes with up to a full one-year money-back guarantee.
[00:23:46.101 --> 00:23:47.463]  Try getting that anywhere else.

[00:24:20.522 --> 00:24:26.267]  We continue at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:26.287 --> 00:24:26.727]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:26.767 --> 00:24:30.070]  I'm Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones, who will return tomorrow.
[00:24:30.791 --> 00:24:36.436]  And again, we'll hear an update from him today at some point regarding the Dog and Pony Show.
[00:24:36.736 --> 00:24:40.419]  I call it Dog and Pony Show in California with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.722]  Anyway, returning with my guest is Jim Rothstein.
[00:24:44.162 --> 00:24:44.883]  Rothstein, I'm sorry.
[00:24:46.647 --> 00:25:00.376]  Jim, let's start off by, you as a retired New York City Police Detective, you were involved in a lot of interesting things, and let's talk about the connections that you discovered in some of the cases that you investigated in New York.
[00:25:01.037 --> 00:25:02.798]  Well, let's start at the very beginning.
[00:25:02.938 --> 00:25:03.358]  Good for it.
[00:25:04.239 --> 00:25:15.146]  One of the things that happened is, I arrested a man by the name of Ben Rose, a high profile guy in New York at the time, who the information originally came in
[00:25:16.299 --> 00:25:29.902]  He was using the name of Dr. Rockefeller and what they were doing were supplying kids to some of the very top people or affluent and influential people in the country and at the United Nations.
[00:25:30.302 --> 00:25:30.622]  Okay.
[00:25:30.862 --> 00:25:43.645]  So with that we started picking up the different information which led us eventually to what turned out to be the Son of Sam case but at the same time there's also where Ben Rose is suspected of being one of the
[00:25:44.418 --> 00:25:57.685]  Main people in the disappearance of Eaton Patz, a young boy who disappeared in New York and has never been solved, but the connections to some foreign elements are very strong there.
[00:25:58.245 --> 00:26:09.770]  The other thing that happened in the late middle 70s, I interviewed a high priestess who had been convicted in a narcotics investigation.
[00:26:10.771 --> 00:26:12.832]  Basically, that was done to discredit her.
[00:26:13.464 --> 00:26:26.088]  But she ended up giving us probably the biggest information into how this whole scenario worked, and how it is tied in with both our narcotics trafficking on the international level.
[00:26:26.728 --> 00:26:34.631]  So you can see, when you talk about terrorism, you tie that together, narcotics and everything, you have probably the greatest terrorist movement going.
[00:26:34.971 --> 00:26:35.531]  Forget about
[00:26:36.181 --> 00:26:41.306]  The Al Qaeda and all that stuff, this is even bigger than that.
[00:26:41.506 --> 00:26:43.127]  And it has been going on a lot longer.
[00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:43.708]  Right.
[00:26:43.948 --> 00:26:47.752]  But after I debriefed her, we had actually found out how this thing works.
[00:26:48.752 --> 00:27:01.344]  And one of the other things that started this was when I first received the information in New York that led me to eventually what turned out to be the son of Sam, we started investigating at Untamaya Park.
[00:27:02.425 --> 00:27:08.570]  Uh, where we got reports of the, uh, sacrifice of German shepherds.
[00:27:09.391 --> 00:27:11.513]  And that's what started the whole investigation.
[00:27:11.553 --> 00:27:19.099]  It wasn't until I ran into Maury Terry and Maury started talking to David Berkowitz that we tied all of this together.
[00:27:19.339 --> 00:27:23.723]  Now, when you say that this woman was a high priestess, a high priestess of what?
[00:27:23.963 --> 00:27:26.205]  She was a high priestess in the occult.
[00:27:27.313 --> 00:27:30.277]  There are different factions, but they basically all operate the same.
[00:27:30.537 --> 00:27:32.039]  So she was like one of the head leaders?
[00:27:32.079 --> 00:27:32.720]  Yes, she was.
[00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.424]  She was Cuban, and she had come out of Cuba.
[00:27:35.484 --> 00:27:42.553]  In fact, she had been Miss Cuba at one time, and then she fell into people in our intelligence community.
[00:27:43.203 --> 00:27:53.268]  And later she worked as a madam in New York and she was also involved in setting up the cocaine connections from on the East Coast to Columbia.
[00:27:53.528 --> 00:27:56.930]  Now when you say she was working for our agency, you're talking about the intelligence community, I mean?
[00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:57.450]  Yes.
[00:27:57.951 --> 00:27:59.772]  You're talking about the CIA?
[00:28:00.152 --> 00:28:01.492]  Or derivatives thereof.
[00:28:01.873 --> 00:28:02.173]  Okay.
[00:28:02.353 --> 00:28:04.294]  See, you have to remember that
[00:28:04.835 --> 00:28:16.661]  Some of these operations aren't really condoned by the CIA, but are offshoots of what I call the opportunity men, who use legitimate things to enhance their own pocketbook.
[00:28:16.681 --> 00:28:18.722]  Because money is a big motivator in this.
[00:28:18.962 --> 00:28:22.524]  So you could say that they're more like rogue agents?
[00:28:22.744 --> 00:28:24.445]  Yes, that's what I would call them, yes.
[00:28:25.585 --> 00:28:42.189]  As you remember in the Frank Olson case now, which is the MKUltra victim who allegedly committed suicide, and now they've actually opened up a murder investigation where it has been disclosed that at that time our intelligence community was running three warehouses in New York.
[00:28:42.449 --> 00:28:42.689]  Yeah.
[00:28:43.369 --> 00:28:47.110]  And I actually had an informant out of that operation.
[00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:52.511]  Now, Frank Olson was one of, in the 50s I think, was supposedly jumped to his death
[00:28:53.112 --> 00:28:56.374]  He was with those guys from the CIA and they'd given him LSD?
[00:28:56.715 --> 00:28:57.815]  Yes, that's part of that.
[00:28:57.916 --> 00:29:00.958]  So you'll see how this stuff all crosses over.
[00:29:00.978 --> 00:29:07.723]  A lot of it is to control and to cause chaos in society.
[00:29:10.004 --> 00:29:12.686]  Okay, we got about 30 seconds before we go to break.
[00:29:13.467 --> 00:29:20.752]  Now, this woman that you're talking about, she opened up the door that ultimately led the New York Police Department into the Son of Sam investigation.
[00:29:20.772 --> 00:29:21.833]  And as you said,
[00:29:22.472 --> 00:29:24.013]  Yes, those were things that we had investigated.
[00:29:24.033 --> 00:29:27.475]  Like I said, it started with the killing of dogs, and I actually went to the site.
[00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:43.935]  And later on, about six years ago, took Maury back to that location and showed him exactly where the whole thing had started.
[00:29:44.296 --> 00:29:45.016]  Okay, hold that thought.
[00:29:45.036 --> 00:29:45.777]  We'll get back to that.
[00:29:46.097 --> 00:29:49.860]  Our number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:51.121]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:51.181 --> 00:29:53.523]  The Aesthetics of Terror is what we're talking about today.
[00:29:53.983 --> 00:29:55.004]  Jim Rostan is my guest.
[00:29:55.024 --> 00:29:56.145]  We'll be right back after this.
[00:29:56.165 --> 00:29:56.846]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[00:29:56.866 --> 00:29:57.266]  Stay tuned.
[00:29:57.286 --> 00:29:59.047]  There's more to come.
[00:30:00.568 --> 00:30:01.489]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:03.471]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.475 --> 00:30:07.297]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:13.483]  You are sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:30:13.623 --> 00:30:19.327]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw food.
[00:30:19.507 --> 00:30:20.869]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:25.032]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[00:30:25.212 --> 00:30:31.017]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[00:30:31.557 --> 00:30:33.779]  The two most complete protein superfoods known.
[00:30:34.139 --> 00:30:36.621]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water.
[00:30:36.942 --> 00:30:44.088]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you to homeostasis.
[00:30:44.368 --> 00:30:48.031]  It's also very hydrating and, more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[00:30:48.311 --> 00:30:50.873]  Good health is achievable when you tune into Achieving Great Health.

[00:32:09.525 --> 00:32:10.326]  Oh my God!
[00:32:10.606 --> 00:32:15.330]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:16.271]  Yes, it's true.
[00:32:16.371 --> 00:32:19.073]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[00:32:19.193 --> 00:32:23.236]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[00:32:23.336 --> 00:32:23.897]  You heard it right.
[00:32:24.077 --> 00:32:29.081]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[00:32:29.241 --> 00:32:30.281]  The list goes on and on.
[00:32:30.501 --> 00:32:34.603]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.
[00:32:34.703 --> 00:32:36.844]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[00:32:37.024 --> 00:32:38.224]  This is a limited time offer.
[00:32:38.364 --> 00:32:42.706]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[00:32:42.866 --> 00:32:44.687]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may miss out forever.
[00:32:47.648 --> 00:32:51.909]  To participate in this limited time offer and have your drugs prescribed over the phone for free, you need to call 1-800-615-7094 now.

[00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:57.391]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[00:32:57.411 --> 00:32:58.311]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[00:33:23.849 --> 00:33:25.572]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:25.592 --> 00:33:26.733]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:28.757 --> 00:33:30.539]  Callers, hold on, we'll get to you in just a moment.
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:38.432]  First, before I get back to my guest, I want to mention to you again, it is very critical and vital that you get a copy of Alex's latest
[00:33:39.052 --> 00:33:41.294]  Video, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:33:41.594 --> 00:33:46.057]  Now in this video, he shows how the greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us.
[00:33:46.557 --> 00:33:51.940]  It's a scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn to enslave every man, woman, and child.
[00:33:52.020 --> 00:34:01.927]  Now, the United States government at all levels, and indeed we're finding this out today as we see all this stuff falling out, has fallen under the control of the desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[00:34:01.967 --> 00:34:03.388]  Now the events of September the 11th mark
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:12.083]  The initiation of the final sick push of the Illuminati to consolidate their One World Order and transform Earth into a prison planet.
[00:34:12.563 --> 00:34:19.166]  Of course, Alex has several videos that are very informative, and he also has a book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:34:19.626 --> 00:34:22.367]  Now, these books and videos are available to you.
[00:34:22.947 --> 00:34:28.449]  The videos are available for $25.95 per tape, plus shipping and handling.
[00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:29.950]  Now, if you order three or more tapes,
[00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:34.854]  The price goes down to $20, plus $20 of tape, plus shipping and handling.
[00:34:35.754 --> 00:34:37.916]  And, of course, you can get his book also, as well.
[00:34:38.416 --> 00:34:40.218]  You can order two ways.
[00:34:41.018 --> 00:34:42.400]  One is his toll-free number, that is 888-253-3139.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.000]  Again, that number is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.423]  He also has, you have the ability to purchase them off of his website.
[00:34:57.191 --> 00:34:59.834]  At www.infowars.com.
[00:35:00.134 --> 00:35:02.716]  www.infowars.com.
[00:35:03.096 --> 00:35:09.922]  As I mentioned, the topic that we're going to be talking about today is something that is covered in Police State 3.
[00:35:10.903 --> 00:35:13.505]  Concerning, you know, what these guys are really up to.
[00:35:13.525 --> 00:35:15.007]  We're talking about the dynamics of it.
[00:35:16.068 --> 00:35:23.054]  And as I mentioned, there is a specific word that is applied or applicable to all of the things that are happening in our culture.
[00:35:23.995 --> 00:35:41.765]  uh... together with uh... the terrorist attacks uh... several of these uh... these notorious crimes that have come down the pike over the last thirty forty years uh... charlie manson was the first one uh... of note uh... of course uh... son of sam and there's been a litany of others including recently the washington dc sniper
[00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:50.551]  Which was another one of those weird deals that seems to have a deeper level at work in it.
[00:35:51.272 --> 00:35:54.252]  These are the kind of things that we've got to be aware of.
[00:35:54.852 --> 00:36:00.273]  These are the clubs that they're using to beat us into becoming a fearful population.
[00:36:00.833 --> 00:36:04.594]  Fearful and begging them to save us.
[00:36:05.374 --> 00:36:07.414]  And this is where things are really, really wrong.
[00:36:07.474 --> 00:36:09.735]  We can't go on like this.
[00:36:09.775 --> 00:36:10.855]  We have to put a stop to this.
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.160]  Welcome back, Jim.
[00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:13.760]  Yes.
[00:36:14.441 --> 00:36:14.841]  Let's go ahead.
[00:36:14.861 --> 00:36:15.942]  We've got a couple of callers online.
[00:36:15.962 --> 00:36:21.385]  Let's go ahead and start taking some calls, and then we'll just continue developing our topic today.
[00:36:21.945 --> 00:36:23.506]  We've got Mike calling in from Florida.
[00:36:23.546 --> 00:36:24.266]  Good afternoon, Mike.
[00:36:24.286 --> 00:36:25.547]  You're on with my guest, Jim Rothstein.
[00:36:25.567 --> 00:36:27.528]  How are you gentlemen doing this afternoon?
[00:36:27.608 --> 00:36:28.249]  Good, thank you.
[00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:31.631]  I don't want to throw you guys off topic.
[00:36:31.671 --> 00:36:40.496]  I kind of wanted to make a comment on what you were talking about yesterday, Michael, but I mean, I don't want to take you guys too far off what you're talking about, because what you're talking about is really good and really important stuff.
[00:36:41.947 --> 00:36:53.975]  Well, my comment is, I think that yesterday, I listened to yesterday's show, and I think that you are kind of slanting the whole... I know you read an article about Quentin Tarantino, and how he is promoting his movie towards 12 years old.
[00:36:54.575 --> 00:37:04.661]  I read that article myself, and I have to disagree with you in the fact that, from what I can read out of it, it sounded like what he was saying was really tongue-in-cheek, and had a lot of sapphire to it.
[00:37:05.622 --> 00:37:07.223]  And I think that you guys are trying to spin it
[00:37:07.905 --> 00:37:15.252]  Or as, I mean, I don't think Quentin Tarantino is saying all 12-year-olds should see Kill Bill and, you know, participate in the violence and whatnot.
[00:37:15.352 --> 00:37:17.754]  I think that that was more of a tongue-in-cheek thing that he was saying.
[00:37:18.095 --> 00:37:22.679]  Well, I was going to say, Mike, you know, here's my take on all of this.
[00:37:22.739 --> 00:37:24.621]  I mean, I'm a grown adult.
[00:37:24.641 --> 00:37:25.442]  You're a grown adult.
[00:37:25.922 --> 00:37:31.768]  You have filters that you have in place that you can, you know, you can filter a lot of stuff out and find out what's good and what's bad.
[00:37:32.348 --> 00:37:35.891]  And you may have control over, you know, how you might react to stuff like that.
[00:37:37.612 --> 00:37:46.919]  My whole contention with this is that this is just another of the many films that may have a satirical plot to it or whatever, and it may be, you know, might be something entertaining.
[00:37:47.583 --> 00:37:59.687]  But the problem is that at a deeper level, a lot of these movies that are coming out of Hollywood are geared to deconstruct our society, desensitize people to important things that make us human and good.
[00:38:00.247 --> 00:38:09.931]  And that's my take on it, and that's why I bring these kinds of things up, because children are watching this stuff, and they don't have the filters.
[00:38:09.951 --> 00:38:11.191]  They're not emotionally developed.
[00:38:11.671 --> 00:38:16.813]  They're not capable of dealing with this in the same way that you or I would be capable of dealing with this.
[00:38:17.566 --> 00:38:19.347]  And that's my issue with it.
[00:38:19.867 --> 00:38:20.308]  Well, very true.
[00:38:20.328 --> 00:38:21.789]  But doesn't that fall more?
[00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:27.852]  I mean, the Motion Picture Association of America gives it an R rating, meaning no one under 17 should be seeing it without a parent.
[00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:28.272]  Right.
[00:38:28.292 --> 00:38:30.634]  Doesn't that responsibility fall more towards a parent than a teen?
[00:38:30.654 --> 00:38:31.374]  Absolutely.
[00:38:31.814 --> 00:38:32.335]  Absolutely.
[00:38:33.095 --> 00:38:33.836]  I agree with that, too.
[00:38:33.876 --> 00:38:38.458]  I mean, the parents are ultimately responsible for what their children take in and what they're doing.
[00:38:38.478 --> 00:38:40.880]  But, you know, like everything else in our culture today,
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:45.684]  Everybody has been put so much to sleep that they don't even realize anymore the harm.
[00:38:46.204 --> 00:38:54.932]  They couch it in things like, you know, like it's a satire or this type of thing and parents would be inclined to maybe even rent the movie or let their kids watch it.
[00:38:55.873 --> 00:39:08.284]  You know, they don't manage these things and they don't realize how important it is to raise your children correctly and properly and to make sure that they're exposed to good things at that formative stage in their life.
[00:39:09.232 --> 00:39:10.293]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:39:10.313 --> 00:39:16.116]  We've let the parenting become done by the TV and by mass media, not by the parents.
[00:39:16.696 --> 00:39:22.839]  And, you know, listening to this show, listening to Alex, you know that Hollywood has been tasked.
[00:39:22.919 --> 00:39:24.580]  I mean, look at what we've got in California now.
[00:39:24.620 --> 00:39:33.104]  We've got the guy that's done Terminator, and a lot of people look up to him, and I think that was part of his glitz and his success in becoming the governor.
[00:39:33.644 --> 00:39:36.606]  People look up to him as a fantasy role player, a character.
[00:39:37.388 --> 00:39:37.629]  Yeah.
[00:39:37.969 --> 00:39:40.954]  And it makes him bigger than life and invincible and that type of thing.
[00:39:41.395 --> 00:39:45.541]  I think the media has a lot to do with shaping the way that we look at things.
[00:39:46.582 --> 00:39:51.370]  Well, I'm a political science major at our college and that was one of the things we always talked about was the voting populace.
[00:39:51.843 --> 00:39:57.269]  Really has no idea what they're voting for and that they're just going by a name or by recognition.
[00:39:57.570 --> 00:39:58.170]  Absolutely.
[00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:00.453]  And Arnold Schwarzenegger fits that profile to a tee.
[00:40:00.933 --> 00:40:03.176]  And the media is the shaper of that.
[00:40:03.196 --> 00:40:04.778]  I mean, the media is the purveyor of that.
[00:40:04.838 --> 00:40:09.163]  That is what, you know, they used to say that reality dictates art.
[00:40:09.778 --> 00:40:13.761]  You know, you look at today, it's art or the media dictates reality.
[00:40:15.101 --> 00:40:25.048]  What I see in my advanced age is the fact that you see a lot of young people identifying with what the media says is right and good, but all it's doing is it's confusing them.
[00:40:25.888 --> 00:40:34.710]  You know, in a society where there are laws, you know, moral relativism does not work when you're facing a judge for murdering somebody.
[00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:38.911]  When you say, well, it was my right to murder this person, you know, for me it was right.
[00:40:39.271 --> 00:40:39.932]  That doesn't work.
[00:40:39.972 --> 00:40:41.492]  They get convicted and sent to jail.
[00:40:42.152 --> 00:40:47.534]  And these kinds of things set up these confusion, these confusing models for kids to follow.
[00:40:47.974 --> 00:40:49.274]  And of course, you know, where are the parents?
[00:40:50.572 --> 00:40:50.992]  Exactly.
[00:40:51.052 --> 00:40:55.414]  And I got one more quick comment, Michael, and I'll let you get back to your great interview and the job you're doing.
[00:40:56.355 --> 00:41:02.498]  On the Terri Schiavo case, I live in Tampa, and I've been following this case ever since it first started happening.
[00:41:03.298 --> 00:41:11.722]  And I don't think that this has anything to do with a conspiracy on the part of the judges or a conspiracy on anybody's part.
[00:41:12.123 --> 00:41:19.086]  I think that this case really just boils down to the fact that Terri Schiavo, when she went into her current state,
[00:41:19.853 --> 00:41:35.361]  She, to her will, told her husband that she didn't want to be left in a vegetative state, and I think it's just really become more of a tug-and-pull between the parents and the husband, and I don't think it really has anything to do with being a conspiracy on the judge's part to rule her to have her tubes pulled.
[00:41:35.782 --> 00:41:39.644]  I think that it has become more of just a fight between the parents and the husband.
[00:41:40.024 --> 00:41:44.246]  It's really a shame that she's been caught up in the middle of all this, and it's gone on for this long.
[00:41:44.526 --> 00:41:44.847]  I agree.
[00:41:44.967 --> 00:41:49.109]  I agree that it's a shame that this whole thing is going on, but the thing is, is this.
[00:41:49.736 --> 00:41:52.138]  I'm not saying it was necessarily conspiracy with the judge.
[00:41:52.158 --> 00:41:58.184]  What I'm saying is that regardless, no one should have the right... I mean, who could prove that she said that to her husband?
[00:41:58.725 --> 00:42:06.753]  I don't believe that anyone should have the right to decide whether you live or die and you're incapacitated and you're unable to make that kind of choice.
[00:42:07.693 --> 00:42:19.356]  Number one, I think morally it's a wrong choice to make anyway for yourself to commit self-murder, but what I'm saying is I don't think that this should even be an issue when it comes to the dignity and the value of human life.
[00:42:19.676 --> 00:42:21.457]  They should not even be having this conversation.
[00:42:21.477 --> 00:42:26.538]  Well, where do we draw the line then as far as a person being in a vegetative state for the rest of their life?
[00:42:27.078 --> 00:42:28.099]  Where is that?
[00:42:28.159 --> 00:42:29.359]  I think that line is being blurred.
[00:42:29.904 --> 00:42:31.588]  As far as to how far we're going to take it.
[00:42:41.178 --> 00:42:42.559]  Science has no explanation.
[00:42:42.579 --> 00:42:49.205]  They've got the legal definitions and medical definitions of vegetative state, but yet this is still a living human being.
[00:42:49.585 --> 00:42:54.370]  As you heard Pamela talking yesterday, she still responds to certain stimuli.
[00:42:55.571 --> 00:42:58.413]  That to me, I wouldn't even want to have that conversation.
[00:42:58.854 --> 00:43:01.176]  We've got to move along, and I want to thank you for your call, Mike.
[00:43:01.216 --> 00:43:01.716]  Keep listening.
[00:43:02.597 --> 00:43:03.417]  Let's take another call.
[00:43:03.457 --> 00:43:05.099]  Roger is calling from Pennsylvania.
[00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:05.820]  Good afternoon, Roger.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:06.200]  You're on the air.
[00:43:07.569 --> 00:43:16.013]  Yeah, thanks, Jens, and I'm guessing you're heading in the direction with Berkowitz and the method and the commonalities with Nansen, even.
[00:43:16.813 --> 00:43:21.955]  That'd be an offshoot of sort of a subrosa unrecurrent in Christian science.
[00:43:22.696 --> 00:43:33.180]  I didn't want to take away from that at all, which... And my question, if you don't think it has any real bearing, then please drop it and move on, but I was very much interested.
[00:43:33.580 --> 00:43:36.822]  I think it's a very important factor that needs to be developed, and that is
[00:43:37.853 --> 00:43:57.927]  With the sort of official ivory tower, therefore the control power, philosophical religious structure having degenerated into the logical outcome of the existentialism that it's impossible to know anything for certain.
[00:43:58.427 --> 00:44:06.953]  We're all agreed present, I presume, that there is no such thing as the unspiritual man, merely certain undeceived ones among the number.
[00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:17.973]  But, so you have this sort of schizophrenia between the official line, the party line, versus the reality, which is very much spiritual.
[00:44:19.034 --> 00:44:27.596]  And I'm wondering, and of course with that existential view, therefore, that opens the way to Machiavellian
[00:44:31.819 --> 00:44:50.457]  Well, see, part of this thing I think is about, we're going to touch on this today, we're going to look at the political, see, when you talk about the aesthetics of terror, we're talking about something that has been around a very long time, but it's a utilization of psychological manipulation and techniques to bring people under control.
[00:44:51.464 --> 00:45:05.816]  And this is something as old as mankind itself, and the thing is that what we're seeing today is we're seeing these techniques that are being used on mass society, and it has a political agenda.
[00:45:06.636 --> 00:45:11.260]  So that's what we're kind of going to be talking about later on as we go along, but thanks for the call, Roger, appreciate it.
[00:45:12.297 --> 00:45:26.046]  Jim, let's get back to this thing that you were doing in New York, because I want to get some more of the dots connected before we bring Noreen on, because I know that one of the things that you were really involved in in New York as a police detective was this thing about children.
[00:45:26.506 --> 00:45:31.629]  You know, you mentioned that children were missing and that they had been... Ben Rose.
[00:45:31.649 --> 00:45:33.150]  Who, by the way, was Ben Rose?
[00:45:33.771 --> 00:45:36.953]  Ben Rose was a pedophile.
[00:45:38.963 --> 00:45:40.544]  He was also a procurer.
[00:45:41.085 --> 00:45:42.266]  He supplied kids.
[00:45:43.547 --> 00:45:48.831]  He was one of the main guys on the scene at the time, not only in New York, but around the country.
[00:45:49.031 --> 00:45:50.312]  Was he an affluent individual?
[00:45:50.672 --> 00:45:51.693]  Very much so, yes.
[00:45:51.753 --> 00:46:02.902]  His father owned a pharmacy on First Avenue, right off from the United Nations, and it had a lot to do with the international trafficking, too.
[00:46:03.302 --> 00:46:03.743]  Of children?
[00:46:04.895 --> 00:46:06.456]  Both male and female.
[00:46:06.736 --> 00:46:09.858]  When you say trafficking in children, what kind of things are we talking about?
[00:46:10.558 --> 00:46:19.143]  Well, you're talking about where they were taking young children, usually just as they were reaching puberty, and were using them for sexual purposes.
[00:46:19.763 --> 00:46:26.407]  And an offshoot of all this, too, was where they used these kids to compromise people, which was a very big part of the operation.
[00:46:28.296 --> 00:46:31.218]  And this is what led to other things.
[00:46:31.318 --> 00:46:41.865]  It's just like when you go one step further, these kids ended up being used as some of these occult and satanic-type ritualistic things.
[00:46:42.386 --> 00:46:46.449]  And just because David Berkowitz was arrested did not stop.
[00:46:46.709 --> 00:46:53.514]  And I see at the present time, in my travels around the country, this is going on now as well as it was then.
[00:46:53.534 --> 00:46:56.315]  Berkowitz was a small man in the operation.
[00:46:57.566 --> 00:46:59.867]  And it goes into big organized places, doesn't it?
[00:46:59.887 --> 00:47:02.269]  Yes, and you'll see the ties out to Manson.
[00:47:02.289 --> 00:47:08.833]  You'll see the ties to the Franklin cover-up, which was John DeCamp's work.
[00:47:09.794 --> 00:47:10.494]  In Nebraska.
[00:47:10.674 --> 00:47:17.218]  Yes, and also there's where you get the direct connection back to Colby, who was at one time the CIA director.
[00:47:17.478 --> 00:47:18.379]  Right, right.
[00:47:18.619 --> 00:47:24.803]  And I'm quite sure when Colby started going, getting a guilty conscience on this led to his demise.
[00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:31.625]  Yeah, Colby died mysteriously, and I think the camp even holds out to this day that he was murdered.
[00:47:32.145 --> 00:47:41.053]  Yes, because at one point I had an investigation where three little boys were murdered in New York on East 64th Street at Ben Rose's apartment.
[00:47:41.633 --> 00:47:43.395]  In fact, he's the one that alerted me to it.
[00:47:45.109 --> 00:47:53.996]  We actually served subpoenas on the people involved in it, and one of the people was in the intelligence community, and it was covered up under national security.
[00:47:54.757 --> 00:47:58.359]  So we know there were two 13-year-olds and a 14-year-old.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:04.064]  They were murdered in a human compromise situation.
[00:48:04.104 --> 00:48:09.388]  They went too far and killed these kids, and we spent months looking for them up in Connecticut.
[00:48:10.038 --> 00:48:29.322]  And eventually when Roy Cohen, who you know was involved in the McCarthy hearings, at one time confided to me that he in fact knew about it and stated that one of his functions was that when these things happened to their people was to get them off, and the other part was to compromise people who they needed on their side.
[00:48:29.864 --> 00:48:33.687]  And when you say you're compromising, you're talking about politicians and people of influence.
[00:48:33.807 --> 00:48:34.908]  Yes, very much so.
[00:48:35.448 --> 00:48:39.611]  That's another, really something that most people don't know about or look at.
[00:48:40.292 --> 00:48:43.114]  It's one of the most effective things they have in the world.
[00:48:43.554 --> 00:48:43.734]  Yeah.
[00:48:44.835 --> 00:48:52.261]  Real quick, before we take our break, you heard me talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger posing for nude photographs with the pervert Mapplethorpe.
[00:48:52.893 --> 00:48:55.854]  Well, Mapplethorpe, he showed up all over the place over the years.
[00:48:56.074 --> 00:49:00.294]  Yeah, who was, you know, from a police perspective, who was this creep?
[00:49:00.654 --> 00:49:17.038]  He was one of the first, oh, he came up many years ago already in some of the investigations that tied to the, well, the whole thing to do with the children using boys and girls and anything weird you could consider.
[00:49:17.058 --> 00:49:18.298]  He was one of the leaders.
[00:49:18.798 --> 00:49:18.958]  Yeah.
[00:49:20.026 --> 00:49:20.366]  Okay.
[00:49:21.967 --> 00:49:24.389]  What do you think about that thing about Arnold posing nude for him?
[00:49:24.949 --> 00:49:32.755]  Well, you know, I was just in California, just returned last night, and I just found it very interesting.
[00:49:32.775 --> 00:49:41.260]  The only good thing I can see out of the whole thing is that people finally realize they do have the power to bring somebody back if he isn't doing his job.
[00:49:42.141 --> 00:49:44.843]  The outcome I don't necessarily agree with, but
[00:49:46.846 --> 00:49:51.087]  People have to understand, they can make these public officials do what they're supposed to do.
[00:49:51.608 --> 00:49:55.109]  And they do it based upon some of the stuff that you discovered as a police officer.
[00:49:55.389 --> 00:49:55.649]  Right.
[00:49:56.169 --> 00:49:58.230]  It died in all over the place.
[00:49:58.310 --> 00:50:15.436]  In fact, at one point in our investigation in the early seventies, Richard Nixon was the president at the time, and he was going to set up a big investigation into this and give us government financing, and lo and behold, he gets taken down.
[00:50:15.496 --> 00:50:16.456]  And I've often wondered,
[00:50:17.488 --> 00:50:34.004]  If that has something to do with it, because I have quite a bit of knowledge on how he was set up and what was behind it, which dovetails right back to the records or the books that were kept on the pedophiles' list that went with the prostitution ring.
[00:50:34.264 --> 00:50:34.464]  Yeah.
[00:50:34.904 --> 00:50:36.346]  We've got to take a break, Jim, so hold on.
[00:50:36.906 --> 00:50:39.749]  And we're going to continue my interview with Jim Rothstein.
[00:50:40.456 --> 00:50:46.801]  And as you're hearing, these guys that are part of this New World Order thing, they all believe they're above the law.
[00:50:47.222 --> 00:50:55.628]  Jim has a story, you know, we talk about human compromise, where they quashed a subpoena for national security in the murder of three young innocent boys.
[00:50:56.129 --> 00:50:56.689]  There's more to come.
[00:50:56.709 --> 00:50:57.790]  Our number tonight, or today, is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:57.810 --> 00:50:57.870]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:58.390]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:10.373 --> 00:51:14.739]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:14.919 --> 00:51:19.345]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:19.486 --> 00:51:23.852]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:23.872 --> 00:51:25.253]  The New World Order.
[00:51:25.834 --> 00:51:27.236]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:40.771 --> 00:51:51.117]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:51.377 --> 00:51:56.740]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:54:16.513 --> 00:54:19.276]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:19.396 --> 00:54:20.897]  We continue.
[00:54:21.298 --> 00:54:23.000]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:23.140]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:27.024]  I'm Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex Jones, who will return tomorrow to the
[00:54:38.574 --> 00:54:43.697]  I'm interviewing Jim Rothstein, who is a retired New York City police detective.
[00:54:44.057 --> 00:54:50.181]  Throughout the duration of the program today, I want you to keep in mind this small idea.
[00:54:50.821 --> 00:54:55.204]  Satanism is a sophisticated and highly effective motivational system
[00:54:59.006 --> 00:55:05.228]  For the spread of violence and cultural terrorism all the while, hiding behind the cloak of the First Amendment.
[00:55:05.388 --> 00:55:16.291]  It is an ideology that has found a strategic application in the criminal underworld, even if it was not invented there.
[00:55:16.811 --> 00:55:25.914]  And I want you to keep that in your mind throughout the program today, because there is strong connections between where we are today, where we have arrived at,
[00:55:26.514 --> 00:55:34.401]  Based upon certain events that have occurred in our culture, including the terrorist attacks themselves, that feed directly into this whole thing.
[00:55:34.441 --> 00:55:38.085]  Because what we are dealing with, when you hear the word terrorism,
[00:55:39.086 --> 00:55:43.591]  You've got to equate this with a criminal enterprise, a criminal cabal of people.
[00:55:44.612 --> 00:55:57.505]  Whether or not the mainstream media says Al-Qaeda is responsible, what you find when you start peeling back the layers of the onion, you find some very, very interesting political connections and money.
[00:55:58.246 --> 00:56:07.030]  You've got to keep in mind, too, that our president and his father raided savings and loans and other notorious scams.
[00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:14.093]  Billions of dollars were sucked out of our economy, out of the pockets of men and women in this country.
[00:56:14.633 --> 00:56:24.498]  And, you know, when you start looking at the dollars that we're talking about here, they add up to huge amounts of money, enough money to actually run maybe governments,
[00:56:25.633 --> 00:56:28.974]  You know, operating a shadow government, if you want to call it that.
[00:56:29.674 --> 00:56:31.675]  You know, we gotta follow the money.
[00:56:31.735 --> 00:56:34.275]  That's really important in all of this, is following the money.
[00:56:34.315 --> 00:56:35.296]  Where did this money go?
[00:56:35.996 --> 00:56:37.336]  Why was no one prosecuted?
[00:56:37.416 --> 00:56:43.258]  Because, you see, the thing is, is that for many years they have manipulated things so that they are in control.
[00:56:44.102 --> 00:56:49.466]  And they are above the law, as you've heard my guest today talking about the three boys that were murdered in New York.
[00:56:50.046 --> 00:56:59.733]  And Roy Cohn is another notorious figure, and he admits to my guest that his job was to get these guys off if they got into trouble.
[00:57:00.194 --> 00:57:05.898]  And you heard him say that they served a guy the subpoena, and it was quashed for national security.
[00:57:06.218 --> 00:57:07.199]  National security?
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:12.883]  We murdered three innocent boys, children, and that's national security?
[00:57:13.618 --> 00:57:14.238]  What do you think, Jim?
[00:57:15.238 --> 00:57:17.699]  That's always been the biggest question I had.
[00:57:18.259 --> 00:57:26.281]  I never, and I've looked over the National Security Act for that, and nowhere have I ever found that killing children should be part of it.
[00:57:26.381 --> 00:57:27.921]  There's no justification for it?
[00:57:28.161 --> 00:57:35.002]  No, and what's amazing is that nothing has ever happened from that investigation.
[00:57:35.142 --> 00:57:38.663]  All it did is any law, and here's another thing that's really amazing.
[00:57:39.585 --> 00:57:45.288]  Any law enforcement agent who has ever gone after this has ended up with nothing but trouble.
[00:57:45.768 --> 00:57:47.009]  Yeah.
[00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:48.629]  The heat is tremendous.
[00:57:48.729 --> 00:57:50.450]  I've seen it all over the country.
[00:57:52.471 --> 00:57:54.292]  And as you mentioned, it's still going on today.
[00:57:54.852 --> 00:57:56.013]  Oh, more now than ever.
[00:57:56.253 --> 00:57:56.413]  Yeah.
[00:57:56.753 --> 00:58:00.695]  Now we're going to take our break and when we come back we're going to be joined by Noreen Goshen.
[00:58:00.735 --> 00:58:04.817]  This is going to illustrate just exactly what we're talking about here, about how
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.426]  This kind of dynamic is at play.
[00:58:07.888 --> 00:58:12.663]  And what they do, they utilize mind control techniques that the CIA refined under MKUltra.
[00:58:13.811 --> 00:58:18.355]  And they work it on children, and this is a very, very insidious business.
[00:58:18.755 --> 00:58:19.996]  Stay tuned, there's a lot more to come.
[00:58:20.036 --> 00:58:22.938]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:24.519]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.861]  Callers, we'll get to you here in just a moment.
[00:58:27.881 --> 00:58:30.883]  Stay on the line, and we'll get back to that in just a minute.
[00:58:31.444 --> 00:58:35.627]  I'm Michael Corbin, filling in for Alex Jones, and we'll be right back after this.
[00:59:00.555 --> 00:59:02.495]  Clean water, clean food, and clean air.
[00:59:02.695 --> 00:59:03.836]  It's what nature intended.
[00:59:04.056 --> 00:59:07.476]  The trouble today is that our nutrients have been stripped and polluted.
[00:59:07.656 --> 00:59:18.538]  That's why your friends at Nutri-Team stock the best in water and... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:26.760]  Big Brother.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:28.360]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:29.159 --> 00:59:30.260]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:31.721]  You want answers?
[00:59:32.501 --> 00:59:34.423]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:34.443 --> 00:59:37.705]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:38.245 --> 00:59:42.308]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:59.119 --> 01:00:01.440]  The now governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:00:02.221 --> 01:00:06.063]  We will be getting an update from him today at some point during the program.
[01:00:06.483 --> 01:00:09.765]  And he will return tomorrow with the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:10.325 --> 01:00:17.169]  And I have online with me today Jim Rothstein, retired New York City police detective, who was involved in some very high-profile cases.
[01:00:17.629 --> 01:00:24.313]  And we're going to be shortly joined by Noreen Ghosh, who is the mother of a boy that was 12 years old when he was kidnapped, taken from the family.
[01:00:24.973 --> 01:00:28.617]  Uh, and the story is just, it's just horrific, uh, what they did to this boy.
[01:00:28.637 --> 01:00:38.008]  And, uh, Noreen's life has been completely turned upside down, as Jim mentioned, uh, you know, early on about how anybody that gets into this kind of stuff and investigates it...
[01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:41.845]  It ends up having a lot of trouble, and you're going to hear her story.
[01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:48.586]  She wrote a book called Why Johnny Can't Come Home, and it's just a heart-rending story.
[01:00:49.046 --> 01:00:52.547]  Real quick, let's get to the phones and get some calls out of the way.
[01:00:52.927 --> 01:00:54.007]  Ron, you're on with my guest.
[01:00:54.047 --> 01:00:54.587]  Good afternoon.
[01:00:56.908 --> 01:00:57.068]  Ron?
[01:00:57.088 --> 01:00:58.828]  Can we have Ron?
[01:01:01.049 --> 01:01:01.649]  Ron, are you there?
[01:01:03.442 --> 01:01:06.143]  Okay, go ahead and put him on hold and we'll go back to him later.
[01:01:06.523 --> 01:01:07.643]  Let's go to Dave in Michigan.
[01:01:07.663 --> 01:01:08.283]  Good afternoon, Dave.
[01:01:08.303 --> 01:01:09.544]  You're on with my guest, Jim Rothstein.
[01:01:09.564 --> 01:01:10.084]  Is Jim there?
[01:01:10.504 --> 01:01:10.924]  Yes, he is.
[01:01:10.944 --> 01:01:11.244]  He's here.
[01:01:11.424 --> 01:01:12.304]  Yeah.
[01:01:12.764 --> 01:01:16.265]  Detroit Free Press, in the last couple of days, they've taken up a new cause.
[01:01:18.226 --> 01:01:20.747]  Kindly old Dr. Kevorkian out of jail.
[01:01:22.147 --> 01:01:26.488]  And Figer, his lawyer that ran for governor, is taking his case back up again.
[01:01:26.508 --> 01:01:29.109]  And they're saying that he's dying in prison.
[01:01:30.461 --> 01:01:35.283]  He's got Hepatitis C and he's got high blood pressure and fainting spells, you know what I mean?
[01:01:35.743 --> 01:01:35.903]  Yeah.
[01:01:35.923 --> 01:01:40.365]  And they're going, oh, let the poor old guy come out of prison and die in peace.
[01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.926]  He's exactly right where he belongs.
[01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:43.646]  I agree.
[01:01:43.927 --> 01:01:44.947]  Jimmy, have any comment on that?
[01:01:46.408 --> 01:01:52.290]  That is just totally absurd, but no, I don't really get into that stuff.
[01:01:54.311 --> 01:01:56.932]  It's just all part of this whole program.
[01:01:56.952 --> 01:01:59.553]  Have you ever seen any of those paintings that he did?
[01:02:00.236 --> 01:02:00.596]  Yeah.
[01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:04.259]  Oh, man, it looks like some of the stuff they used to have on Night Gallery.
[01:02:05.279 --> 01:02:13.445]  Well, it's obvious that somebody who's done the things that he's done is probably tormented by what may be awaiting him when he passes away.
[01:02:14.265 --> 01:02:17.207]  I'd like to know how he contacted Hepatitis C in prison.
[01:02:17.507 --> 01:02:17.727]  Yeah.
[01:02:18.648 --> 01:02:19.568]  Okay, Dave, we've got to move on.
[01:02:19.588 --> 01:02:20.369]  Thank you for your call.
[01:02:21.149 --> 01:02:22.831]  Let's go ahead back to Ron in New York.
[01:02:22.851 --> 01:02:23.451]  Good afternoon, Ron.
[01:02:23.471 --> 01:02:24.772]  You're on with my guest, Jim Rothstein.
[01:02:25.112 --> 01:02:25.953]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:31.867]  Um, I had brought this issue up with Alex somewhere about, I guess, a week and a half ago.
[01:02:32.347 --> 01:02:34.989]  I'm retired from the same organization as Jim.
[01:02:35.609 --> 01:02:35.809]  Okay.
[01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:53.242]  And it was in reference to, uh, Robert Mapp, Maplethorpe Association, or at least it was a suspected association with the Carr brothers who were suspected of being associated, of course, with the son of Sam Killings.
[01:03:01.062 --> 01:03:03.303]  Yes, there was a connection there.
[01:03:03.323 --> 01:03:17.588]  The Carr brothers, which is actually, they're the sons of what is known as Sam Carr, who ended up being the guy that actually started, or was the mover of this whole thing, which led to the son of Sam.
[01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:19.729]  That's where the son of Sam comes from.
[01:03:20.965 --> 01:03:33.773]  And at the time we did, I don't know when he retired, but Mapplethorpe showed up across the board on a lot of these things tied to the West Village and some of the other operations.
[01:03:33.853 --> 01:03:34.893]  There was connections.
[01:03:35.534 --> 01:03:37.195]  They were quite loose, but they were there.
[01:03:37.955 --> 01:03:44.079]  As I understand it, the method was the organization or the cult that they belonged to.
[01:03:44.399 --> 01:03:46.620]  Actually, it was called the process was the other name.
[01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.321]  Yes, the method was also part of it.
[01:03:49.918 --> 01:03:56.419]  When it came time that, at that time, in the late seventies, during the investigation... Hey, Ron, let me... Ron, let me interrupt you.
[01:03:56.459 --> 01:03:58.860]  I'm going to hold you over, okay?
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:01.740]  We'll put you on hold and we'll come back to that.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.901]  We've got to take a break.
[01:04:03.921 --> 01:04:04.021]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:04.041 --> 01:04:04.101]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:04:04.481 --> 01:04:13.962]  We have online with us a person who was involved in the investigation of the Son of Sam and other notorious cases, and you're hearing all about it right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:14.363 --> 01:04:15.103]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[01:04:15.123 --> 01:04:15.443]  Stay tuned.
[01:04:15.463 --> 01:04:16.023]  There's more to come.
[01:04:16.043 --> 01:04:16.643]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:22.884 --> 01:04:27.388]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:27.728 --> 01:04:31.832]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:04:32.112 --> 01:04:32.672]  We listened.
[01:04:32.973 --> 01:04:37.957]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:04:38.237 --> 01:04:38.717]  We listened.
[01:04:39.098 --> 01:04:42.140]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:04:42.561 --> 01:04:43.101]  We listened.
[01:04:43.561 --> 01:04:46.504]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[01:04:46.544 --> 01:04:46.964]  We're good to
[01:05:13.454 --> 01:05:14.435]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:14.455 --> 01:05:15.897]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:21.238 --> 01:05:28.061]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:05:28.381 --> 01:05:29.761]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[01:05:29.941 --> 01:05:32.142]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:05:32.322 --> 01:05:34.403]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:05:34.683 --> 01:05:39.605]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:05:39.945 --> 01:05:43.967]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:05:44.227 --> 01:05:46.008]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:05:46.068 --> 01:05:56.734]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:05:56.875 --> 01:05:58.776]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:05:58.996 --> 01:06:02.858]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.

[01:06:18.647 --> 01:06:21.208]  Oh my God!
[01:06:21.468 --> 01:06:26.190]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:27.151]  Yes, it's true.
[01:06:27.231 --> 01:06:29.932]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:06:30.072 --> 01:06:34.094]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:06:34.194 --> 01:06:34.754]  You heard it right.
[01:06:34.935 --> 01:06:39.937]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:06:40.077 --> 01:06:41.137]  The list goes on and on.
[01:06:41.357 --> 01:06:45.459]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.
[01:06:45.559 --> 01:06:47.699]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[01:06:47.879 --> 01:06:49.100]  This is a limited time offer.
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:53.561]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[01:06:53.721 --> 01:06:55.001]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may
[01:06:57.642 --> 01:06:57.922]  We're good.
[01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:28.826]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:29.426 --> 01:07:32.467]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:34.488 --> 01:07:40.449]  Now we continue, Michael Corbin sitting in for Alex Jones, who will be rejoining the program tomorrow.
[01:07:40.509 --> 01:07:41.289]  He'll be back tomorrow.
[01:07:41.929 --> 01:07:50.531]  In the meantime, I want to mention, I do a program, a syndicated program on GCN on Saturday nights, 6 to 8 Mountain, 8 to 10 Eastern, called A Closer Look.
[01:07:51.518 --> 01:08:01.381]  And also, starting next Monday night, I will be doing an extension of that program, Monday through Friday, 5 to 6, Mountain Time, on GCN Radio Network, A Closer Look.
[01:08:01.841 --> 01:08:08.944]  Our website is www.4acloserlook, that's the number 4, acloserlook.com, and I hope to see you all there.
[01:08:09.764 --> 01:08:16.586]  Now, let's go back to Ron, our caller Ron from New York, and my guest, Jim Rothstein, before we go to our other guest, Noreen Ghosh.
[01:08:17.162 --> 01:08:17.723]  Ron, are you with us?
[01:08:17.823 --> 01:08:21.605]  Yes, I am.
[01:08:23.327 --> 01:08:32.653]  At the time, in the late 70s, when this occurred, the NYPD, my understanding, tried to speak with Mr. Mapplethorpe, who made himself scarce.
[01:08:33.254 --> 01:08:36.036]  I believe he may have left the state, is what was indicated.
[01:08:37.941 --> 01:08:47.928]  A funny part about that, and you know this is one of the things with Arnold Schwarzenegger, though I was never supportive of his candidacy, I find really troubling, his association with Mapplethorpe, or at least alleged association with him.
[01:08:48.228 --> 01:08:48.428]  Yeah.
[01:08:49.048 --> 01:08:52.931]  We move forward ten years later, okay, to the late 1980s.
[01:08:52.971 --> 01:08:56.333]  Now you remember the controversy in Ohio with Mapplethorpe's art exhibit?
[01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:56.813]  Yeah.
[01:08:57.374 --> 01:09:03.638]  An associate of mine at the time, an acquaintance, was a detective with NYPD and I was an officer in NYPD.
[01:09:04.525 --> 01:09:07.888]  We struck a conversation up because that was pretty much front page news at that time.
[01:09:08.969 --> 01:09:13.272]  And he had indicated that he was associated with somebody else.
[01:09:13.832 --> 01:09:14.993]  He didn't even want to name his name.
[01:09:15.954 --> 01:09:30.825]  And that the NYPD, for several years after the arrest of David Burke, with maybe up until about the early or middle 80s, was investigating leads here and there about the cultic or the conspiratorial aspects of the Son of Sam case.
[01:09:31.746 --> 01:09:32.687]  And a friend of his,
[01:09:33.382 --> 01:09:37.005]  Had gone to the Far West as part of this investigation.
[01:09:37.065 --> 01:09:41.889]  Now, this guy was very happy, quite satisfied with his career.
[01:09:42.690 --> 01:09:44.171]  Didn't really have a care in the world.
[01:09:44.711 --> 01:09:46.793]  Was a very good investigator, very good detective.
[01:09:47.574 --> 01:09:50.896]  He came back from the Far West frightened.
[01:09:52.177 --> 01:10:01.225]  All he had indicated, according to what my friend had said to me, was that he had encountered people of great status and influence as a result of this investigation.
[01:10:02.068 --> 01:10:06.309]  Wanted nothing more to do with it, and put in for early retirement.
[01:10:06.609 --> 01:10:06.829]  Yeah.
[01:10:07.249 --> 01:10:08.529]  It was never seen from again.
[01:10:08.549 --> 01:10:12.550]  He said, you know, his friend never came by again to say hello or anything of that nature.
[01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:23.392]  This is kind of the thing that you run into with this kind of stuff, is that this apparently has connections at very, very high levels, and a person can find themselves very dead if they press too hard on it.
[01:10:23.712 --> 01:10:25.092]  It started that investigation.
[01:10:25.472 --> 01:10:26.772]  Well, let me comment on that.
[01:10:27.412 --> 01:10:29.033]  I can bring that up even closer.
[01:10:29.093 --> 01:10:31.333]  Six years ago, I was brought back out to New York.
[01:10:32.003 --> 01:10:36.627]  To Yonkers Police Department where they had reopened the Son of Sam case.
[01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:51.858]  And as soon as I got out there and the former chief of detectives who handled the Berkowitz case notified the police department to pull their detective off because there was no way they wanted the Son of Sam case reopened.
[01:10:52.439 --> 01:10:57.903]  There was much more to the Son of Sam case than just the killings that took place.
[01:10:58.507 --> 01:10:59.748]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:11:00.008 --> 01:11:03.250]  And what happened to that detective is quite common.
[01:11:03.370 --> 01:11:07.973]  I knew a number of guys that just flat out backed out of it and wouldn't go there.
[01:11:08.073 --> 01:11:11.575]  I think I was the only one and eventually they drummed me out of there.
[01:11:11.615 --> 01:11:16.758]  I was forced to retire in 1980 because of the investigations we were doing.
[01:11:17.659 --> 01:11:22.622]  One of my former partners, they in fact dropped a shrapnel bomb on his bed.
[01:11:24.403 --> 01:11:27.305]  So you can see there's a lot of heat on this and I think I know
[01:11:27.985 --> 01:11:33.588]  The detective, uh, what he was doing out on the West Coast, because this definitely ties straight across.
[01:11:33.908 --> 01:11:41.071]  It's the interstate 90, what we call the interstate 90-94 run, uh, but that doesn't mean it doesn't go anywhere else.
[01:11:41.692 --> 01:11:42.292]  Right.
[01:11:42.352 --> 01:11:45.734]  But the amazing part about it is, as I said, yeah, he became so frightened.
[01:11:45.814 --> 01:11:53.017]  The guy went out there, you might describe him according, as I said, according to this, my professional associate, and he was my acquaintance and friend, too, this guy.
[01:11:53.677 --> 01:11:56.919]  His friend, who was a detective, went out there like daylight.
[01:11:57.381 --> 01:11:58.962]  He came back like nighttime.
[01:11:59.222 --> 01:11:59.542]  Frightened.
[01:11:59.802 --> 01:12:00.763]  Threw his papers in early.
[01:12:00.783 --> 01:12:00.863]  Yeah.
[01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:04.884]  Threw his papers in and retired early, which is... Your guests will know that.
[01:12:04.964 --> 01:12:08.306]  That is not the most usual occurrence in NYPD.
[01:12:08.626 --> 01:12:08.806]  Nope.
[01:12:08.946 --> 01:12:10.687]  You know, you don't opt for early retirement.
[01:12:10.767 --> 01:12:13.168]  He was so frightened, he never even called back.
[01:12:13.228 --> 01:12:18.811]  Now, as a former police officer, I know this, you know this, you always sort of check back with your friends.
[01:12:18.851 --> 01:12:19.751]  How's everything doing?
[01:12:19.811 --> 01:12:20.312]  How you going?
[01:12:20.972 --> 01:12:23.453]  The guy just completely disappeared off the map.
[01:12:23.513 --> 01:12:25.494]  He felt that was consistent with his safety.
[01:12:26.104 --> 01:12:28.525]  Well, I'll just give you one more little anecdotal story.
[01:12:28.545 --> 01:12:30.066]  It's not necessarily Maplethorpe.
[01:12:30.106 --> 01:12:34.648]  Another friend of mine, who is presently with the NYPD, is an active duty officer.
[01:12:35.668 --> 01:12:37.749]  In his precinct, this is what happens.
[01:12:37.849 --> 01:12:42.891]  There is a house with a number of people and a number of children in it, in his precinct area.
[01:12:43.691 --> 01:12:47.433]  One of the neighbors makes a confidential call to the Bureau of Child Welfare.
[01:12:47.533 --> 01:12:48.433]  They suspect something.
[01:12:49.274 --> 01:12:55.136]  So what happens, the social worker from that organization goes to the house, knocks on the door, gets no answer or cooperation.
[01:12:56.676 --> 01:12:58.597]  Um, they ask around with the neighbors.
[01:12:59.277 --> 01:13:01.319]  Now, I'm sure this was not the neighbor that launched the call.
[01:13:01.339 --> 01:13:08.803]  The neighbor ignorantly informed the people that some official from the Department of Social Services was knocking at your door.
[01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:24.311]  My friend, the Bureau of Child Welfare social worker, just a few days later, just a few days later, goes to his precinct, requests that the officers accompany her back to the house, and guess what?
[01:13:24.904 --> 01:13:27.545]  Not only are they gone, the house was bulldozed.
[01:13:28.185 --> 01:13:29.246]  There was nothing left.
[01:13:29.746 --> 01:13:31.106]  They destroyed any evidence trail.
[01:13:31.146 --> 01:13:36.388]  They disappeared into thin air and had the very house they were residing in obliterated and bulldozed.
[01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:38.909]  So this is the way these people operate.
[01:13:38.949 --> 01:13:40.170]  They don't leave any loose ends.
[01:13:40.470 --> 01:13:41.550]  That's very correct.
[01:13:41.611 --> 01:13:45.292]  Maury, if possible, could you get Ron to get my phone number and call me?
[01:13:46.601 --> 01:13:47.581]  You want to do that, Ron?
[01:13:47.621 --> 01:13:49.222]  I'll take his phone number.
[01:13:49.362 --> 01:13:52.423]  Okay, the engineer will take your call, put you on hold, and get your phone number.
[01:13:52.883 --> 01:13:56.805]  Now, Jim, we're going to move on because we've got Noreen Gosch online with us.
[01:13:57.285 --> 01:14:03.107]  This is an incredible story, too, that basically goes into some very strange places as well.
[01:14:03.407 --> 01:14:05.128]  Let's go on directly to Noreen.
[01:14:05.548 --> 01:14:09.309]  Noreen is the mother of Johnny Gosch, who disappeared in the 80s.
[01:14:09.349 --> 01:14:09.750]  He was 12 years old.
[01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:17.412]  She has spent her entire life from that point forward trying to get some answers and to get her son back.
[01:14:17.472 --> 01:14:26.855]  Her son, ironically, and surprisingly, is still alive as far as she knows, but he did show up on her doorstep many years later and he had quite a story to tell.
[01:14:27.956 --> 01:14:31.777]  The story now is contained in her book, Why Johnny Can't Come Home.
[01:14:31.797 --> 01:14:34.618]  We'll find out about how to get a copy of that book, but without further ado,
[01:14:35.299 --> 01:14:37.281]  Noreen, thank you for being on the program with us today.
[01:14:37.441 --> 01:14:39.062]  Well, thank you so much for having me on.
[01:14:39.102 --> 01:14:40.062]  I really appreciate it.
[01:14:40.343 --> 01:14:40.863]  No problem.
[01:14:41.163 --> 01:14:42.784]  Let's go real quick to your story.
[01:14:43.205 --> 01:14:43.645]  Tell your story.
[01:14:43.665 --> 01:14:46.327]  We've got about four minutes before we take a break, but go ahead and tell your story.
[01:14:46.507 --> 01:14:46.927]  Okay.
[01:14:46.967 --> 01:14:54.733]  On September 5, 1982, my son was delivering his Sunday morning newspapers, and he was kidnapped off the street.
[01:14:55.333 --> 01:15:04.240]  There were two men that they could tell, one vehicle, and there were several witnesses that saw the people take him.
[01:15:04.827 --> 01:15:10.790]  And there were also in the group of witnesses, one of them was a 44-year-old attorney.
[01:15:11.251 --> 01:15:13.592]  So we had fairly reputable witnesses.
[01:15:15.233 --> 01:15:26.239]  And as in a lot of situations with kidnapped children, you don't always get the response that you hoped for with law enforcement.
[01:15:26.259 --> 01:15:31.762]  That has changed since Johnny's kidnapping, but something wasn't right here and I knew it.
[01:15:33.496 --> 01:15:36.718]  The truth was they chose not to in this case in West Des Moines, Iowa.
[01:15:36.738 --> 01:15:39.019]  Now you found out as part of your investigation that
[01:15:54.924 --> 01:16:03.546]  That there was some premeditation and Johnny had been stalked or selected probably beforehand for being kidnapped.
[01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:04.527]  That's true.
[01:16:04.807 --> 01:16:13.929]  Nine years later a young man came forward by the name of Paul Benassi who stated that he had been present at the time of the kidnapping.
[01:16:14.009 --> 01:16:14.969]  In fact he helped.
[01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:16.430]  He was one of the kidnappers.
[01:16:17.010 --> 01:16:24.032]  And he told us how our family had been watched for some period of time and then they also came into our neighborhood
[01:16:24.949 --> 01:16:28.170]  A few weeks before the kidnapping and took photos of Johnny.
[01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:33.171]  So they knew exactly who they were coming after and they watched our movement.
[01:16:33.211 --> 01:16:37.192]  They knew what time he went on his paper route and things of that nature.
[01:16:37.592 --> 01:16:39.632]  Now this was in, was this in Des Moines, Iowa?
[01:16:39.892 --> 01:16:40.472]  West Des Moines.
[01:16:40.592 --> 01:16:41.272]  West Des Moines.
[01:16:41.693 --> 01:16:48.654]  Jim, you're very familiar with the Omaha, Nebraska child pornography and satanic ring that was going on there.
[01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:50.629]  Who is Paul Benassi?
[01:16:50.949 --> 01:17:00.595]  Paul Benassi was one of the primary victims, and the one that John DeCamp worked with very closely, and we got a lot of information off of that.
[01:17:01.535 --> 01:17:06.458]  And the Johnny Gosch case definitely ties off all of these things.
[01:17:06.558 --> 01:17:09.540]  It's the same with many other cases around the country.
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:12.762]  And I'm quite familiar with Noreen's story.
[01:17:12.822 --> 01:17:18.085]  I've met and talked to Noreen a number of times, and this is one of the classic cases
[01:17:19.112 --> 01:17:21.954]  Why the police didn't investigate is the big question.
[01:17:21.974 --> 01:17:30.158]  I had personally spoke to the captain, or I guess he ended up being the captain, who basically told me there was nothing done.
[01:17:30.578 --> 01:17:30.759]  Yeah.
[01:17:32.339 --> 01:17:33.640]  Okay, Noreen, go back to your story.
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:39.243]  In the brevity of time, we're going to have to kind of punctuate it a little bit, but Johnny disappears.
[01:17:39.263 --> 01:17:44.166]  The cops don't seem to be helping at all in trying to help find him.
[01:17:45.046 --> 01:17:46.467]  And go on from there.
[01:17:47.307 --> 01:17:50.329]  Well, it was a matter of frustration and urgency.
[01:17:50.529 --> 01:17:53.471]  I hired private investigators to begin a search of my own.
[01:17:54.151 --> 01:18:02.716]  And it was through that search that I was able to find out the majority of the information about what happened to Johnny, who was involved.
[01:18:02.836 --> 01:18:05.938]  And the information that came from Paul Benassi was extremely helpful.
[01:18:07.899 --> 01:18:10.200]  What did you find out from Benassi?
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:15.003]  I found out that Johnny was taken for purposes of being in a prostitution pornography ring.
[01:18:17.935 --> 01:18:23.639]  And that these kids were shipped all around the country to be used by wealthy pedophiles.
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:27.282]  And that Johnny, in fact, was very much alive.
[01:18:28.723 --> 01:18:33.846]  And it was several years later that he did show up on my doorstep.
[01:18:34.267 --> 01:18:40.852]  And I do believe that to this day that he is probably in touch with and communicates with Paul Benassi.
[01:18:41.892 --> 01:18:43.694]  He would be considered a trusted friend.
[01:18:43.714 --> 01:18:47.016]  Paul was very young at the time Johnny was kidnapped.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:54.805]  And he was forced to participate by the kidnappers because they had done the same thing to Paul, basically.
[01:18:54.825 --> 01:18:55.125]  Yeah.
[01:18:55.725 --> 01:18:55.986]  Okay.
[01:18:56.046 --> 01:18:56.466]  Hold that thought.
[01:18:56.486 --> 01:18:57.206]  We've got to take a break.
[01:18:57.306 --> 01:18:59.328]  When we come back, we'll continue with your story, Noreen.
[01:18:59.768 --> 01:19:01.869]  That's Noreen Gosch and Jim Rothstein on the line with us.
[01:19:02.270 --> 01:19:02.750]  Our number is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:02.850]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:19:02.870 --> 01:19:04.311]  Filling in for Alex Jones, I'm Michael Corbin.
[01:19:04.351 --> 01:19:05.091]  There's a lot more to come.
[01:19:05.131 --> 01:19:05.412]  Stay tuned.
[01:19:05.492 --> 01:19:06.612]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:24.679 --> 01:19:26.300]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[01:20:42.541 --> 01:20:51.248]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[01:20:51.708 --> 01:20:52.809]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:20:53.317 --> 01:20:57.078]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:20:57.338 --> 01:21:03.961]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.

[01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:33.792]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:21:34.252 --> 01:21:35.352]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:21:35.372 --> 01:21:39.434]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:21:40.074 --> 01:21:53.318]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:59.181]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:05.402]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:22:06.123 --> 01:22:07.383]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:07.403 --> 01:22:09.103]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:22:09.123 --> 01:22:09.543]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:09.563 --> 01:22:11.584]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:22:11.604 --> 01:22:11.664]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:23.513 --> 01:22:24.334]  Oh my God!
[01:22:24.594 --> 01:22:29.317]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:33.220]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[01:22:34.821 --> 01:22:35.621]  This is Pat Cooper.
[01:22:35.661 --> 01:22:38.103]  Tony Delvecchio is coming to the station very soon.
[01:22:38.163 --> 01:22:38.723]  I'm sweet.
[01:22:38.783 --> 01:22:40.124]  I'd book any day now.
[01:22:40.585 --> 01:22:41.485]  You're gonna love his show.
[01:22:43.166 --> 01:22:46.048]  That's all about this with your host, Tony Delvecchio.
[01:22:46.168 --> 01:22:48.350]  Saturday evenings from 9 to 10 p.m.
[01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:51.632]  Central Time, right here on the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:22:53.115 --> 01:22:54.015]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[01:22:54.056 --> 01:23:01.199]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year, and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[01:23:01.459 --> 01:23:04.361]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[01:23:04.561 --> 01:23:10.203]  If you have a business, product, or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[01:23:10.463 --> 01:23:14.305]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[01:23:14.906 --> 01:23:19.368]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station, or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:28.307]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:28.988 --> 01:23:31.291]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:34.298 --> 01:23:37.841]  And indeed, there is a war on for your mind and your pocketbook.
[01:23:38.321 --> 01:23:40.383]  Your soul is at stake here.
[01:23:40.763 --> 01:23:44.266]  And our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:44.286 --> 01:23:44.486]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:44.847 --> 01:23:49.711]  I'm Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex Jones, who will return tomorrow.
[01:23:50.191 --> 01:23:59.639]  And I want to invite you to tune into my program on Saturday night, 6 to 8 Mountain, 8 to 10 Eastern, right here on the GCN Radio Network for a closer look.
[01:23:59.659 --> 01:24:02.281]  And again, our website is www.gcnradio.com.
[01:24:02.873 --> 01:24:06.074]  The number four, acloserlook.com.
[01:24:06.794 --> 01:24:09.836]  And returning are my guests Noreen Gosch and Jim Rothstein.
[01:24:10.116 --> 01:24:14.377]  Noreen is the mother of Johnny Gosch and the author of the book, Why Johnny Can't Come Home.
[01:24:14.937 --> 01:24:20.399]  And Jim is a retired New York City police detective who devotes his life now to locating missing children.
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:23.761]  And as we're hearing, there is a connection.
[01:24:23.881 --> 01:24:27.402]  And we're going to hear that from Noreen, too, as well, about her own particular individual case.
[01:24:28.058 --> 01:24:33.082]  From what she has learned in her investigation, there is a connection to much, much greater places.
[01:24:33.162 --> 01:24:41.528]  And as we've heard Jim talking, even with caller Roy from New York, these leads about this stuff go into some very high places.
[01:24:41.608 --> 01:24:49.754]  And they are for what I would even call a term that Michael Sweeney has coined, political control technologies, if you will.
[01:24:50.895 --> 01:24:53.576]  Noreen, let's go back to your story.
[01:24:54.877 --> 01:24:56.899]  Getting to the part now, Johnny shows up.
[01:24:57.478 --> 01:25:02.141]  You've had a really frustrating time, lots of trouble with law enforcement.
[01:25:02.642 --> 01:25:09.566]  Nobody seems to want to do anything about it, and you know, you've gone out on your own investigation here, trying to locate your son.
[01:25:09.967 --> 01:25:11.388]  Johnny shows up on your doorstep.
[01:25:11.428 --> 01:25:12.809]  What does he tell you about this stuff?
[01:25:13.509 --> 01:25:26.458]  Yes, Johnny did show up after seeing me on a national TV program, and while he was here, which was a very short time, he told me that he indeed was taken for exactly what Paul Benassi had told us.
[01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:27.950]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:25:55.646 --> 01:25:57.706]  Found again by the men who had taken them.
[01:25:59.927 --> 01:26:04.588]  I thought he was home to stay when he showed up at the door, and that was not the case.
[01:26:05.008 --> 01:26:11.369]  When I offered to call somebody for some help, he said, no, I can't stay.
[01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:13.510]  If I do, they'll kill me.
[01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:15.850]  I have to go.
[01:26:16.631 --> 01:26:22.732]  But I wanted to tell you what had taken place, and in his mind he thought that
[01:26:24.153 --> 01:26:33.356]  If I would just go to the police or the county attorney or whomever and tell them this, that they would begin to make arrests because he named some names too.
[01:26:34.256 --> 01:26:40.998]  Well that, he didn't realize that just by my going to tell them, that wasn't enough.
[01:26:41.958 --> 01:26:44.399]  He would have to be the one to go public.
[01:26:45.939 --> 01:26:49.380]  And he then left after a couple hours visit.
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:56.803]  Directly after that, about a week later, I was able to get the county attorney to meet with me.
[01:26:57.563 --> 01:27:01.044]  And I went in and I gave him all the information that Johnny gave me.
[01:27:01.825 --> 01:27:05.406]  But I told him that there was an informant that had come forward.
[01:27:05.507 --> 01:27:08.328]  I did not reveal that it was my son.
[01:27:08.348 --> 01:27:13.590]  And it was because Johnny asked me not to tell anyone that he had been here.
[01:27:14.851 --> 01:27:16.692]  And I didn't for over two years.
[01:27:18.813 --> 01:27:19.673]  After two years,
[01:27:20.422 --> 01:27:28.867]  I was subpoenaed to testify in a federal court in Lincoln, Nebraska on behalf of Paul Banasi.
[01:27:29.808 --> 01:27:37.112]  And while I was on the witness stand, the attorney asked if I had ever seen or talked to my son in the entire time he was missing.
[01:27:37.132 --> 01:27:38.313]  Of course, you were under oath.
[01:27:38.533 --> 01:27:39.374]  And I was under oath.
[01:27:39.714 --> 01:27:45.717]  And unfortunately, there was a reporter in the back of the room that was writing down everything that everybody said.
[01:27:47.754 --> 01:27:56.159]  Long story short, the story went nationwide and then there were a lot of people that said, oh well, he's not alive, she made it up, all that kind of crap.
[01:27:59.021 --> 01:28:04.163]  Johnny's life basically really is at stake as well as these other young kids.
[01:28:04.664 --> 01:28:06.004]  They don't trust anyone.
[01:28:06.464 --> 01:28:07.125]  Why should they?
[01:28:07.585 --> 01:28:09.766]  There were law enforcement people involved in it.
[01:28:10.987 --> 01:28:14.769]  We know that right from Des Moines, Iowa when Jim talked to the captain.
[01:28:15.322 --> 01:28:17.743]  We told them they didn't do anything because they were told not to.
[01:28:19.183 --> 01:28:20.403]  You hear this a lot, don't you, Jim?
[01:28:20.963 --> 01:28:21.863]  Yes, you do.
[01:28:22.163 --> 01:28:31.245]  And for the people in the audience who do not believe what Noreen's saying, there were things that were told to her that I knew about long before Johnny came home.
[01:28:31.925 --> 01:28:39.627]  And the other thing that I have seen, and this is important to remember, once they have these people 72 hours, they're gone.
[01:28:40.917 --> 01:28:46.658]  And it takes some very qualified people to bring them back into the norm again.
[01:28:47.018 --> 01:28:47.239]  Okay.
[01:28:47.539 --> 01:28:48.239]  Hold that, both of you.
[01:28:48.259 --> 01:28:50.099]  We've got to take another break.
[01:28:50.119 --> 01:28:52.060]  1-800-259-9231 is our number.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:52.540]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:58.261]  Noreen Gosch and Jim Rothstein are my guests, and there's a lot more to come.
[01:28:58.281 --> 01:29:00.281]  This is a very, very complex story.
[01:29:01.322 --> 01:29:03.642]  But we're hearing about it, so we'll be right back after this.
[01:29:03.662 --> 01:29:04.042]  Stay tuned.
[01:29:04.062 --> 01:29:05.463]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:05.523 --> 01:29:06.143]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[01:29:06.163 --> 01:29:06.703]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:11.889 --> 01:29:14.892]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:15.813 --> 01:29:18.595]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:21.954 --> 01:30:27.858]  Some people believe a group of wealthy men controlled political parties, the American media, and the wealth of our nation.
[01:30:28.278 --> 01:30:28.959]  Is this true?
[01:30:29.519 --> 01:30:34.482]  Dr. Stanley Monteith spent 40 years studying secret societies and subversive movements.
[01:30:34.803 --> 01:30:40.587]  He lived in Africa for three years, and when he returned home, he studied the writings of the men who shaped the modern world.

[01:31:45.102 --> 01:31:49.203]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[01:31:49.423 --> 01:31:51.545]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:31:51.725 --> 01:31:53.586]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:31:53.787 --> 01:31:59.812]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.

[01:32:14.884 --> 01:32:16.366]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:16.426 --> 01:32:17.487]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:32:34.524 --> 01:32:36.264]  And I continue, or we continue, I should say.
[01:32:36.284 --> 01:32:39.825]  I'm Michael Corbin, sitting in for Alex Jones, who will return tomorrow.
[01:32:40.445 --> 01:32:56.268]  And before we go back to my guests, Noreen Gosch and Jim Rothstein, I just want to mention to you folks that what you're hearing today is an extension of what Alex has been talking about and writing about and videotaping documentaries about for a very long time.
[01:32:56.868 --> 01:33:01.089]  And the fact of the matter is that you cannot afford to be uninformed.
[01:33:02.517 --> 01:33:23.616]  These programs, Alex Jones program, my program A Closer Look, exists solely for the purpose of bringing you the truth at deeper levels than the mainstream media would care to acknowledge and accept or even disseminate to the public because this stuff is very disturbing and does show that this corruption that we're talking about, this
[01:33:25.493 --> 01:33:29.016]  Stuff that we're talking about goes to very high places, and it's not good.
[01:33:29.056 --> 01:33:38.024]  These are the people that are in control of your political thought, your economic affairs, your private life, and all of that.
[01:33:38.084 --> 01:33:40.747]  And it's something that is very, very vital.
[01:33:41.391 --> 01:33:46.154]  That you get informed about because an informed citizenry is a prepared citizenry.
[01:33:46.695 --> 01:33:50.878]  And one of the things that Alex makes available to you are tapes, videotapes.
[01:33:51.758 --> 01:33:58.443]  And it's something that you really, really should buy, not only for yourself, but you should buy them to give them to friends, relatives.
[01:33:59.541 --> 01:34:10.264]  The other thing that's very important is to disseminate this information to city, local officials, as well as state officials, the people you might know in your sphere of influence, your friends, and things like that.
[01:34:10.704 --> 01:34:14.025]  Now, Alex's latest video is Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:34:14.446 --> 01:34:22.528]  He's done another one called 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 2000, and of course, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:34:23.274 --> 01:34:34.541]  These are incredible videos and they're chock full of documented facts about how you are being robbed of your liberties and your minds and your families.
[01:34:35.582 --> 01:34:37.203]  And I would highly encourage you to get these.
[01:34:37.243 --> 01:34:42.446]  Now these tapes, the videotapes, are available for $25.95 plus shipping and handling.
[01:34:42.466 --> 01:34:48.130]  And if you order three or more tapes, the price goes down to $20 a tape plus shipping and handling.
[01:34:48.570 --> 01:34:50.592]  You can get these tapes by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:50.632 --> 01:34:52.553]  Again, that number is toll free.
[01:34:52.573 --> 01:34:52.634]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:52.654 --> 01:34:55.015]  Or, you can order them off of Alex's website at www.infowars.com.
[01:34:55.076 --> 01:34:55.996]  Again, www.infowars.com.
[01:35:10.598 --> 01:35:20.567]  Also, you've got to be checking out Infowars.com every single day, because they keep that thing refreshed, updated on all the late-breaking, emerging stories that show.
[01:35:20.587 --> 01:35:26.812]  I mean, it's a roadmap of what these guys are up to, just like this thing with the Arnold Schwarzenegger thing in California.
[01:35:28.113 --> 01:35:29.534]  You know, this is the tip of the iceberg.
[01:35:30.395 --> 01:35:31.476]  So be sure and do that.
[01:35:31.536 --> 01:35:34.238]  Again, the videotapes are $25.95 plus shipping and handling.
[01:35:34.278 --> 01:35:37.101]  The latest one is Police State 3, total enslavement.
[01:35:37.988 --> 01:35:38.068]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:40.770 --> 01:35:48.015]  Again, 1-888-253-3139 or www.infowars.com.
[01:35:48.755 --> 01:35:51.697]  Now, back to my guests, Noreen Gosch and Jim Rostein.
[01:35:52.237 --> 01:35:58.041]  And, real quick, I want to get a little bit more commentary from Noreen in just a moment, but let's take a couple of calls, okay?
[01:35:58.321 --> 01:35:59.842]  We've got Eric calling in from Texas.
[01:35:59.862 --> 01:36:00.503]  Good afternoon, Eric.
[01:36:00.523 --> 01:36:01.323]  You're on with my guests.
[01:36:03.685 --> 01:36:03.885]  Eric.
[01:36:05.097 --> 01:36:05.297]  Hello?
[01:36:05.798 --> 01:36:06.618]  Eric, you're on the air.
[01:36:06.878 --> 01:36:07.239]  Hi, Michael.
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:15.045]  I'm calling in about the general topic that we're talking about, and would you agree that's Satanism?
[01:36:15.726 --> 01:36:17.848]  Well, Satanism is a large part of it.
[01:36:18.928 --> 01:36:26.074]  The word I ascribe to the topic today is the Aesthetics of Terror, and we're going to get to that in the next hour about the bigger picture and how this plugs into everything.
[01:36:26.315 --> 01:36:26.515]  Okay.
[01:36:26.535 --> 01:36:27.996]  I just want to introduce myself.
[01:36:28.056 --> 01:36:29.297]  My name is Eric Wayne Bolton.
[01:36:29.317 --> 01:36:30.778]  I'm from Austin, Texas.
[01:36:31.018 --> 01:36:32.119]  I live here with Alex.
[01:36:32.179 --> 01:36:33.420]  I'm a Texas show producer.
[01:36:34.429 --> 01:36:35.290]  Channel 10 8 p.m.
[01:36:35.330 --> 01:36:49.218]  here in Austin on Wednesday night and I have a website 9-11 exposed and I'm calling in because this topic I didn't think I'd ever get to this topic but you know I got involved at 9-11 and then as you know the rabbit hole goes much deeper.
[01:36:49.239 --> 01:36:57.904]  So I just published an essay called RC Tanaka President which is chock full of information and links
[01:36:58.718 --> 01:37:00.219]  Well, Eric, I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[01:37:00.239 --> 01:37:01.259]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:37:01.699 --> 01:37:07.281]  Give your phone number to the board operator, the engineer, and we'll make contact, okay?
[01:37:07.321 --> 01:37:12.003]  Okay, but I do have a few more questions about this and a comment about it.
[01:37:12.023 --> 01:37:13.004]  I want to bring up a topic.
[01:37:13.964 --> 01:37:14.784]  Are you still there, Michael?
[01:37:14.965 --> 01:37:15.305]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:37:15.365 --> 01:37:15.705]  Okay, great.
[01:37:16.305 --> 01:37:25.809]  I just want to bring up this topic because I heard on another show on Genesis, another caller called in and he was calling about the same topic, tilesecturing, and he brought up
[01:37:27.165 --> 01:37:39.093]  This FBI operation called Operation Brownstone, and when I did a cursory search through Google.com typing in Operation Brownstone, I came across a letter of links regarding this.
[01:37:39.113 --> 01:37:49.621]  I was wondering if we could shed some light and knowledge on that, and I also have that link posted on 9-11 exposed inside the article, Our Satanic President.
[01:37:49.978 --> 01:37:50.218]  Okay.
[01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:51.659]  Thanks, Eric, for the call.
[01:37:51.679 --> 01:37:53.799]  Jim, do you have any comments on Operation Brownstone?
[01:37:54.099 --> 01:37:59.241]  Yes, I'm familiar with it, although I have not had the opportunity to look into it in depth.
[01:38:00.122 --> 01:38:02.402]  But, yes, I'm familiar with it.
[01:38:02.922 --> 01:38:03.343]  Okay.
[01:38:03.463 --> 01:38:05.403]  Does it go into these directions that Eric was saying?
[01:38:05.603 --> 01:38:06.184]  Yes, it does.
[01:38:06.504 --> 01:38:06.804]  Okay.
[01:38:07.344 --> 01:38:08.104]  Let's take another call.
[01:38:08.124 --> 01:38:09.205]  Diane from South Carolina.
[01:38:09.225 --> 01:38:09.925]  Good afternoon, Diane.
[01:38:09.945 --> 01:38:10.785]  You're on with my guests.
[01:38:12.966 --> 01:38:13.306]  Diane.
[01:38:15.067 --> 01:38:18.828]  My question is, the Lacey Peterson out in California,
[01:38:19.266 --> 01:38:24.309]  When they were talking about this could be satanically linked, oh, everybody jumped up and said, no, no, no.
[01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:38.056]  But from hearing and reading some of your stuff, and other people's stuff, it talks about that at that time of year, December 24th, around that, they get a pregnant woman, they take the child, and then later on, they talk about the child being sacrificed.
[01:38:38.116 --> 01:38:40.097]  Does either one of your people know about this?
[01:38:40.777 --> 01:38:42.958]  You know, about this type of stuff?
[01:38:43.218 --> 01:38:44.519]  Could it possibly be linked?
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:45.340]  Jim?
[01:38:45.721 --> 01:38:54.109]  In fact, up in Maine, I had some priests come to me who had a mother who they were going to take the child and sacrifice.
[01:38:54.549 --> 01:38:56.751]  There are other cases similar to that.
[01:38:57.572 --> 01:39:02.957]  There is a type of thing that does involve that, yes.
[01:39:04.578 --> 01:39:08.302]  Thank y'all for everything you're doing, because like I said, if y'all don't tell us
[01:39:08.977 --> 01:39:10.138]  Nobody will ever find out.
[01:39:10.158 --> 01:39:10.418]  That's right.
[01:39:10.438 --> 01:39:10.718]  You got it.
[01:39:10.758 --> 01:39:11.559]  Keep listening, Diane.
[01:39:11.579 --> 01:39:12.139]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:12.159 --> 01:39:12.660]  Thank you.
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:13.580]  Noreen, do you have any comments on that?
[01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:20.645]  I know, did Johnny mention to you anything having to do with any kind of occult rituals or anything like that involving the group that he was involved in?
[01:39:21.946 --> 01:39:33.554]  I have not gotten any information directly that he was, although Paul Benassi did describe cult activities and satanic rituals that he was forced to attend.
[01:39:34.555 --> 01:39:38.438]  But he did not attend the same ones that Johnny might have.
[01:39:43.695 --> 01:39:49.439]  Well, I would like to bring up one thing, Noreen, and see if this is true in your case, which I believe it is.
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:54.923]  All the shows that you and I have done, together and separate,
[01:39:55.623 --> 01:40:04.868]  What amazes me, no politician on either the state or federal level or any law enforcement agent has ever called to find out more.
[01:40:05.308 --> 01:40:06.949]  I find this just mind-boggling.
[01:40:06.989 --> 01:40:11.732]  A person would think somewhere in this country there must be somebody who's willing to stand up.
[01:40:12.832 --> 01:40:13.053]  Yes.
[01:40:13.553 --> 01:40:14.313]  I think so too.
[01:40:14.373 --> 01:40:15.494]  My feelings exactly.
[01:40:15.534 --> 01:40:16.795]  There's never been anyone.
[01:40:18.155 --> 01:40:21.177]  I even testified for a Senate hearing
[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:27.762]  Well, that's interesting because they made sure that I did not attend any of that.
[01:40:27.882 --> 01:40:29.463]  They didn't want me there.
[01:40:51.246 --> 01:40:56.569]  That was in August of 1984, and then after that hearing, nobody did anything.
[01:40:56.589 --> 01:41:13.580]  None of those official people sitting there in that room ever contacted me again about anything in my testimony, which laid it out pretty well about what I suspect had happened to Johnny based on my private detective reports, and I documented everything.
[01:41:14.521 --> 01:41:15.642]  They weren't interested.
[01:41:15.702 --> 01:41:19.064]  They just did the hearings, I think, as a feel-good kind of effort.
[01:41:19.854 --> 01:41:21.675]  Make the public think they're doing something.
[01:41:21.875 --> 01:41:29.357]  Sure, and that's why we need people like Maury and other people in the media to start pushing this thing and hope somebody has the guts to take it on.
[01:41:29.657 --> 01:41:29.877]  Yeah.
[01:41:30.557 --> 01:41:31.458]  Jim, by the way, it's Michael.
[01:41:31.898 --> 01:41:32.918]  Michael, I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:41:32.938 --> 01:41:34.499]  Yeah, that's okay.
[01:41:34.659 --> 01:41:37.920]  I think that a lot of people are easily compromised, don't you, Jim?
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:41.461]  Very easily compromised and scared of their careers.
[01:41:41.621 --> 01:41:48.543]  Yeah, for either something they've done in their life that they don't want to come out, or their careers, or maybe the safety of their own families.
[01:41:49.704 --> 01:41:50.804]  That's been my experience.
[01:41:50.984 --> 01:41:51.545]  Very true.
[01:41:52.245 --> 01:41:55.206]  Let me ask you this, Jim, from a law enforcement perspective.
[01:41:55.826 --> 01:42:09.251]  Obviously, in Noreen's case, the satanic thing in Omaha, Nebraska, led to a very illustrious character who has been in the news other times, a retired lieutenant colonel from the Army.
[01:42:09.692 --> 01:42:10.112]  Aquino.
[01:42:10.452 --> 01:42:11.052]  Michael Aquino.
[01:42:12.733 --> 01:42:15.194]  Noreen, did that come up in any of your investigation?
[01:42:15.454 --> 01:42:15.794]  Oh, yes.
[01:42:16.334 --> 01:42:18.435]  He was referred to as the colonel.
[01:42:19.305 --> 01:42:24.340]  And, uh, his name has come up repeatedly by Banasti and other witnesses.
[01:42:29.365 --> 01:42:30.686]  Jim, what can you add to that?
[01:42:31.086 --> 01:42:35.948]  Yes, Aquino's name has come up many, many times over many investigations.
[01:42:36.688 --> 01:42:53.296]  There was a little book put out called The Masters of Persuasion, which he threatened that if this book came out he was going to sue, and so far he hasn't sued, and I hope he does because I would love to see what his response would be to the information that is out there about his connection to all of this.
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:43:00.352]  Now Aquino, as some people in the audience may know, I know this name has come up before on different programs.
[01:43:00.913 --> 01:43:04.901]  He was the lieutenant colonel from the army that was, he was
[01:43:05.743 --> 01:43:07.705]  I don't want to say he was not convicted.
[01:43:07.745 --> 01:43:25.941]  As a matter of fact, they dropped the charges, but his name came up in the investigation at the Presidio in San Francisco, in the daycare center there, the Presidio Daycare Center, where several children had alleged that they had been victimized and ritualized by Aquino and the director of the daycare center, Gary Hambright.
[01:43:27.328 --> 01:43:30.690]  And, of course, that whole thing was covered in what paper was it?
[01:43:30.710 --> 01:43:31.911]  The San Jose Mercury News?
[01:43:32.251 --> 01:43:33.152]  Do you remember, was it?
[01:43:33.412 --> 01:43:33.872]  Yes, it was.
[01:43:34.073 --> 01:43:34.273]  Yeah.
[01:43:34.733 --> 01:43:36.775]  That is an interesting story in and of itself.
[01:43:36.835 --> 01:43:45.361]  And, of course, there was actually allegations that came up from other military bases that he had been involved in, where the allegations were basically the same.
[01:43:46.282 --> 01:43:49.044]  And, you know, the thing is, we're talking about children here now.
[01:43:49.839 --> 01:44:00.943]  And, you know, some folks will recall the McMartin Daycare Center in Manhattan Beach, California, that also there was a big trial over that deal about the children claiming that they had been brutalized.
[01:44:02.043 --> 01:44:10.986]  From your perspective, Jim, again going back to some of the stuff that you've learned in your career as a law enforcement officer, what, you know, some people have called it Project Monarch.
[01:44:12.144 --> 01:44:15.166]  You may have a comment about this too, but some people call it Project Monarch.
[01:44:15.306 --> 01:44:31.094]  I know that nobody has ever been able to verify that that is the correct title of the operation that is alleged to be connected to the CIA, but one of the things that Project Monarch has dealt with as far as what we know about it
[01:44:31.853 --> 01:44:44.648]  Is that there may be some rogue element in the government or some outfit that is taking children at a very young age, ritually terrorizing them, and creating multiple personality disorder.
[01:44:44.668 --> 01:44:52.437]  I know this has a lot to play, or a big part to play in this, because Paul Benassi himself has been diagnosed with MPD, multiple personality disorder.
[01:44:52.978 --> 01:44:56.880]  Multiple personality disorder is a trauma-based conditioning.
[01:44:57.321 --> 01:45:07.987]  It is a psychological aberration or problem that comes up from ritually abusing children and it seems like this is kind of the method that they use.
[01:45:08.447 --> 01:45:17.152]  They get children at a very early age and they do this to them and they train them to become prostitutes, drug couriers, assassins even.
[01:45:18.197 --> 01:45:19.278]  Can you add to that, Jim?
[01:45:19.758 --> 01:45:21.519]  Yes, I have heard about this.
[01:45:21.759 --> 01:45:46.831]  I have never been able to prove it, but over the years, dealing with many of the victims, there is a loose-knit connection that I find where these people fall into this and are, I shouldn't say programmed, because it's not that definite an item, but influenced or motivated to follow that type of lifestyle, yes.
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:50.721]  I have never been able to verify that it officially exists.
[01:45:51.081 --> 01:45:56.903]  Noreen, did Johnny mention anything to you about anything like that that occurred to him, like any kind of brainwashing or mind control?
[01:45:57.263 --> 01:45:59.503]  Yes, he did, and so did Paul Benassi.
[01:46:00.023 --> 01:46:10.606]  And Paul Benassi claimed that they had areas in the Offutt Air Force Base in Omaha, Nebraska, where they did this.
[01:46:11.147 --> 01:46:16.168]  And then I did a radio program, and people who had worked at Offutt Air Force Base,
[01:46:17.378 --> 01:46:26.022]  And we're no longer there, called in, these were ex-military men, called in on the program and said that, yes, that was true.
[01:46:26.062 --> 01:46:31.464]  They were conducting those mind control experiments and they had classrooms full of children.
[01:46:32.024 --> 01:46:38.146]  And then they would take them to other army bases or air force bases for other types of training.
[01:46:38.787 --> 01:46:43.168]  And my question was, well, how did they bring you in without somebody asking questions?
[01:46:43.769 --> 01:46:46.850]  And they were brought in and they were meshed right with ROTC.
[01:46:47.938 --> 01:46:48.178]  Yeah.
[01:46:48.638 --> 01:46:50.119]  And then nobody would ask any questions.
[01:46:50.199 --> 01:46:51.960]  It's just another group of ROTC.
[01:46:52.280 --> 01:46:52.500]  Yeah.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:47:09.706]  And Paul Bonacci also told me that a lot of the kids that were taken, kidnapped for this purpose, some were trained on the military side and some were trained as prostitutes or the clergy.
[01:47:11.187 --> 01:47:13.648]  And he said there were two separate types of training.
[01:47:14.614 --> 01:47:34.665]  And he told me that he and Johnny were put into the military side and then I've seen diaries that Paul Benassi wrote and some of the pages were exact steps of how to build bombs and lots of other technical types of things that he would not have known otherwise.
[01:47:35.005 --> 01:47:35.245]  Yeah.
[01:47:35.365 --> 01:47:38.787]  And he wrote those diaries while he was in prison.
[01:47:40.208 --> 01:47:41.649]  It wasn't like he was, you know,
[01:47:42.913 --> 01:47:43.873]  Sitting in a library.
[01:47:44.254 --> 01:47:44.474]  Yeah.
[01:47:45.174 --> 01:47:45.794]  Let's grab a call.
[01:47:45.814 --> 01:47:47.435]  We've got Ron calling in from Oklahoma.
[01:47:47.475 --> 01:47:48.195]  Good afternoon, Ron.
[01:47:48.215 --> 01:47:50.116]  You're one of my guests today.
[01:47:50.136 --> 01:47:51.677]  We have a little bit of time, so make it quick.
[01:47:51.877 --> 01:47:52.117]  Go ahead.
[01:47:52.157 --> 01:47:52.517]  You're on the air.
[01:47:52.577 --> 01:47:53.017]  Okay, Michael.
[01:47:53.037 --> 01:47:56.579]  I just finished Techsmartt's book, Circle of Intrigue, about the Illuminati.
[01:47:57.019 --> 01:47:57.159]  Right.
[01:47:57.239 --> 01:47:59.800]  Okay, it's got me wondering about a connection.
[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:03.021]  Your guest, Jim, mentioned Richard Nixon.
[01:48:03.061 --> 01:48:04.622]  Pressure brought to bear on him.
[01:48:04.742 --> 01:48:07.303]  I'm wondering what we're talking about here.
[01:48:07.943 --> 01:48:12.585]  Simply pedophiles, recalls, anti-criminal, kidnap for profit.
[01:48:13.722 --> 01:48:14.562]  Can he unlike me?
[01:48:15.103 --> 01:48:16.043]  What's going on here?
[01:48:16.783 --> 01:48:18.184]  Well, yes.
[01:48:19.184 --> 01:48:20.705]  All these things mesh together.
[01:48:21.585 --> 01:48:23.325]  You'll find there's different levels.
[01:48:23.806 --> 01:48:26.887]  They go from one level to the next.
[01:48:27.027 --> 01:48:28.047]  It's across the board.
[01:48:28.147 --> 01:48:32.209]  It's loose-knit, and it just functions.
[01:48:33.009 --> 01:48:34.529]  These things all tie together.
[01:48:34.869 --> 01:48:42.212]  What about the Secret Society, the Illuminati, the Invisible Hand, which I've been aware of for years, but I'm now just beginning to find out about from
[01:48:42.717 --> 01:48:46.100]  Looks like a circle of intrigue, an order out of chaos.
[01:48:47.021 --> 01:48:49.042]  Yes, you'll see all of these things.
[01:48:49.082 --> 01:48:50.604]  Why are they secret societies?
[01:48:51.144 --> 01:48:58.831]  In any society that's secret, where you go through an initiation that degrades you or breaks you, is part of the program.
[01:48:58.911 --> 01:48:59.952]  That's what it's all about.
[01:49:01.093 --> 01:49:01.833]  It's about control.
[01:49:02.193 --> 01:49:03.394]  Yes, mind control.
[01:49:03.815 --> 01:49:08.018]  Controlling you in your lifestyle, controlling you in how you think.
[01:49:08.419 --> 01:49:09.740]  That's what the purpose of it is.
[01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:10.420]  Right.
[01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:15.325]  The invisible hand, the propaganda machine that runs Hollywood, the media, blah, blah, blah.
[01:49:16.325 --> 01:49:22.531]  I'm also getting the impression here that we've got CIA and military and Department of Defense involvement in this.
[01:49:23.058 --> 01:49:34.884]  And it makes me wonder about Matrix, DARPA, and Echelon, how much information they're gathering, and how they're going to use this to possibly blackmail officials and public officials, law enforcement, whoever, to do their bidding.
[01:49:35.144 --> 01:49:36.005]  Ron, that's the game.
[01:49:36.165 --> 01:49:36.945]  That is the game.
[01:49:37.266 --> 01:49:37.886]  That is the game.
[01:49:38.286 --> 01:49:47.551]  It's about money and control, it's about influence and positioning people like pawns on a chessboard to ultimately bring us into tyranny, and that's where this is all going.
[01:49:49.091 --> 01:49:49.231]  Okay.
[01:49:49.271 --> 01:49:50.732]  It's mind-boggling.
[01:49:50.852 --> 01:49:51.733]  You're right, it is.
[01:49:52.093 --> 01:49:52.974]  Thanks for your call, Ron.
[01:49:53.374 --> 01:49:53.975]  We've got to move on.
[01:49:53.995 --> 01:49:55.115]  We've got to take a break.
[01:49:55.275 --> 01:49:57.817]  Noreen Gosch and Jim Rothstein will join me on the other side of the break.
[01:49:58.398 --> 01:49:59.298]  Stay tuned, there's more to come.
[01:49:59.338 --> 01:50:03.561]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:50:03.581 --> 01:50:04.142]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:50:04.402 --> 01:50:10.006]  Noreen is going to give out information, too, about how you can get a copy of Why Johnny Can't Come Home.
[01:50:10.586 --> 01:50:14.129]  It is quite a story, and it is sick what these people are doing to our children.
[01:50:14.619 --> 01:50:15.660]  We'll be right back after this.
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.500]  I'm Michael Korman filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:50:17.941 --> 01:50:18.561]  There's more to come.
[01:50:18.581 --> 01:50:19.241]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:21.803 --> 01:50:26.145]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:26.325 --> 01:50:30.747]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:30.907 --> 01:50:35.269]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:50:35.389 --> 01:50:36.630]  A New World Order.
[01:50:37.190 --> 01:50:38.652]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:52.168 --> 01:51:02.518]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:02.798 --> 01:51:08.164]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:51:21.215 --> 01:51:27.479]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:51:27.599 --> 01:51:33.763]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:34.043 --> 01:51:42.428]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:42.708 --> 01:51:49.776]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:50.056 --> 01:51:54.881]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:55.101 --> 01:52:00.507]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:52:00.848 --> 01:52:03.891]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:52:04.231 --> 01:52:12.162]  Get the Illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:53:24.668 --> 01:53:30.713]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:31.313 --> 01:53:34.296]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:39.955 --> 01:53:42.257]  We continue 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:42.277 --> 01:53:42.497]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:42.637 --> 01:53:52.025]  And Noreen, real quick, can you give out the information about how people can get a copy of Why Johnny Can't Come Home?
[01:53:52.385 --> 01:53:52.626]  Yes.
[01:53:52.746 --> 01:53:58.731]  People can go to my website, which is www.johnnygosh.com.
[01:53:59.431 --> 01:54:01.133]  And on there, there's information.
[01:54:01.153 --> 01:54:02.534]  There's also a printable
[01:54:03.118 --> 01:54:07.041]  Order for them if they wish to just mail a check, or they can do it through the internet.
[01:54:07.241 --> 01:54:07.622]  Okay.
[01:54:08.022 --> 01:54:14.847]  Again, that's www.johnnyjohnygosh.com.
[01:54:15.147 --> 01:54:16.308]  That's right.
[01:54:16.869 --> 01:54:19.671]  Noreen, you've got a couple of minutes before the end of the hour.
[01:54:21.472 --> 01:54:23.134]  Just wrap it up for me, would you?
[01:54:24.094 --> 01:54:31.140]  Well, up to present day, we know that Johnny is still alive, and I was given information about a couple of weeks ago.
[01:54:31.775 --> 01:54:35.896]  That he moved from one location where he had been living to another.
[01:54:36.677 --> 01:54:42.398]  And apparently he felt it was safer, there was some reason for him to pick up stakes and move.
[01:54:42.939 --> 01:54:46.380]  And this is pretty much what these kids do.
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:53.722]  They don't have any formal education, usually past junior high, so they just move around the country and live as a vagabond.
[01:54:54.062 --> 01:54:57.363]  And he recently moved again, from what I was told.
[01:54:57.383 --> 01:54:59.764]  And that's the latest.
[01:55:00.441 --> 01:55:01.041]  That's the latest.
[01:55:01.842 --> 01:55:11.728]  As a mother, and I know this has been extremely painful for you, but as a mother, what do you say to these people that were responsible for what they did to your son?
[01:55:13.689 --> 01:55:15.410]  I want to see justice served.
[01:55:16.271 --> 01:55:27.397]  I'm not a seeker of revenge, but I feel that justice needs to be served because these people will continue to hurt other children and ruin more and more families every chance they get.
[01:55:28.998 --> 01:55:30.079]  They won't stop.
[01:55:30.717 --> 01:55:35.799]  As long as there's supply and demand, there will be kidnappings of children.
[01:55:36.399 --> 01:55:40.321]  How does this change your outlook or viewpoint on what's going on?
[01:55:40.341 --> 01:55:43.282]  You know, like a civil authorities, law enforcement, and that type of thing.
[01:55:43.722 --> 01:55:47.244]  I've been very disappointed in the reaction of our law enforcement locally.
[01:55:47.264 --> 01:55:54.047]  I know they were bought, they were told not to investigate, and the former police chief died earlier this year.
[01:55:54.067 --> 01:55:57.428]  And I had hoped that once his death had taken place,
[01:55:58.646 --> 01:56:03.950]  That maybe it would loosen up some information, and that has not happened yet.
[01:56:06.752 --> 01:56:21.724]  We know the extent of the involvement there, and this has been a very long, hard road, and the one detective who was helpful to me on the department is in Iraq.
[01:56:22.184 --> 01:56:24.886]  He's with the National Guard, and he won't be back for some time.
[01:56:25.580 --> 01:56:28.883]  So my one ally I have there is not there right now.
[01:56:29.183 --> 01:56:31.285]  Is Johnny free of that lifestyle?
[01:56:31.345 --> 01:56:36.349]  In other words, as long as he's away from them, he has the opportunity to try and get his life back?
[01:56:36.429 --> 01:56:38.090]  I assume that's part of what he's doing.
[01:56:38.110 --> 01:56:42.033]  He's free to the degree that he's not doing exactly what they had him doing.
[01:56:42.634 --> 01:56:50.240]  But without education or any other formal training, I'm sure that he earns money any way he can to live.
[01:56:52.321 --> 01:56:54.983]  That's sad, because that's not what anybody would want for their child.
[01:56:55.323 --> 01:56:56.944]  No, of course not.
[01:56:57.204 --> 01:56:58.645]  It's very hard to think about that.
[01:56:59.265 --> 01:57:00.786]  He's a grown man now.
[01:57:00.846 --> 01:57:02.347]  He's not a little boy anymore.
[01:57:02.367 --> 01:57:05.748]  Well, Noreen, thank you very much for coming on the program.
[01:57:05.769 --> 01:57:06.629]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:06.649 --> 01:57:08.150]  Hello to Jim, and thank you, too.
[01:57:08.450 --> 01:57:09.611]  Thank you, Noreen.
[01:57:09.731 --> 01:57:10.311]  Bye-bye now.
[01:57:10.411 --> 01:57:11.192]  We'll be in touch, Noreen.
[01:57:11.212 --> 01:57:11.672]  Thank you.
[01:57:12.112 --> 01:57:13.013]  That was Noreen Gosch.
[01:57:13.053 --> 01:57:15.494]  Coming up next hour, we're going to be joined by Maury Terry.
[01:57:16.129 --> 01:57:21.551]  Who is the author of The Ultimate Evil, a book that was reprinted actually a couple of years ago.
[01:57:21.571 --> 01:57:23.191]  It's available at the bookstores.
[01:57:23.652 --> 01:57:24.652]  This is an incredible story.
[01:57:24.672 --> 01:57:30.254]  We're going to hear about the bigger dynamic now, about the group that was involved in The Son of Sam.
[01:57:31.810 --> 01:57:36.853]  It just goes into some wild places, and Jim Rothstein will be staying with us on that part of the hour, too.
[01:57:36.873 --> 01:57:38.213]  So, there's a lot more to come.
[01:57:38.233 --> 01:57:41.175]  Our number today is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:41.195 --> 01:57:41.915]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:41.935 --> 01:57:46.978]  And we'll be right back after this.
[01:57:47.318 --> 01:57:49.819]  Callers, we'll take you coming up back from the break.
[01:57:50.299 --> 01:57:52.700]  Stay tuned, there's a lot more to come on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:53.181 --> 01:57:55.322]  Filling in for Alex Jones, who will return tomorrow.
[01:57:55.802 --> 01:57:56.642]  I'm Michael Corbin.
[01:57:56.942 --> 01:57:58.003]  We will be right back.
[01:58:12.253 --> 01:58:16.863]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:58:17.063 --> 01:58:21.512]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
