[00:00:02.589 --> 00:00:05.830]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.374 --> 00:00:15.034]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.694 --> 00:00:16.815]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.455 --> 00:00:18.636]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:18.656 --> 00:00:20.016]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:21.137]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:25.978]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.538 --> 00:00:30.660]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:46.569]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:47.689]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.670]  It's Monday, the 28th
[00:00:51.904 --> 00:00:57.547]  Of July 2003, we'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:58.588 --> 00:01:05.871]  We've got two guests coming up today that I'll tell you about a little bit later in the next segment, and a ton of news.
[00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:17.658]  You talk about firestorms going on all over the place, but much of it is nothing but a red herring diversion operation by the globalists.
[00:01:18.798 --> 00:01:19.779]  We have the Senators
[00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:39.450]  Up on the Sunday news shows yesterday talking about how the government whitewash commission excised out 20 plus pages of information about Saudi Arabia and how they were tied to the terrorists.
[00:01:40.484 --> 00:01:44.546]  Folks, Saudi Arabia didn't run the terrorists, the globalists did.
[00:01:44.666 --> 00:01:48.808]  MI5, MI6, CIA, Mossad.
[00:01:48.828 --> 00:01:50.948]  From all the evidence.
[00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:55.170]  Now, are the Saudis aware of it and involved in it?
[00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.531]  At a certain level they are.
[00:01:56.591 --> 00:02:08.756]  In fact, about two weeks ago, the Saudis had gotten word that they were going to be in the report from Congress and the White Wash Commission.
[00:02:10.043 --> 00:02:18.535]  And they said, if you list our banks as funding terrorists, we're going to list who owns our banks and who was involved in the transfers.
[00:02:18.895 --> 00:02:21.739]  And they said it's four top U.S.
[00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:24.242]  banks with connections to U.S.
[00:02:24.323 --> 00:02:25.044]  intelligence.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:41.954]  There were a bunch of articles in mainstream foreign press as the Saudis and the Saudi foreign minister in Washington, of course it wasn't in our news, said, if you list us, we're going to tell the world how you're involved in the terror.
[00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:47.980]  And so, yes, that part of the report got cleaned up real fast.
[00:02:50.183 --> 00:02:53.286]  And remember, only part of the overall report's been released.
[00:02:53.386 --> 00:03:00.412]  There's stuff in there about Dick Cheney's Energy Commission bragging about how they'd soon get the Iraq oiled.
[00:03:01.793 --> 00:03:08.659]  There's stuff in there with informants and FBI agents living with hijackers on both the West and East Coast.
[00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:21.020]  I mean, yeah, there's a lot of really bad stuff in there, but it's nothing compared to the really big smoking guns of insider trading by the CIA against American and United.
[00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:32.692]  It is nothing, nothing compared to public officials being warned not to fly to New York that day or the Pentagon and the White House ordering NORAD to stand down.
[00:03:34.082 --> 00:03:36.264]  Or the fact that hijackers were trained at U.S.
[00:03:36.384 --> 00:03:38.666]  military bases, on and on and on.
[00:03:38.726 --> 00:03:43.630]  That's why you need to get Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:03:44.211 --> 00:03:55.020]  A story so big I've had to make two films and write a book that are condensed information just trying to cover the sloppy execution of 9-1-1.
[00:03:56.741 --> 00:04:00.244]  And information on the book and the films are on InfoWars.com
[00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:05.606]  And PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net right now.
[00:04:06.707 --> 00:04:11.070]  Okay, there's a bunch of other news, too, and it's really a ridiculous quantity of it.
[00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:18.075]  I'm going to try to just briefly run through some of the headlines on about 20 stories, if I can do it, when we get back.
[00:04:18.295 --> 00:04:22.798]  And then we'll also take your calls in this hour.
[00:04:22.918 --> 00:04:28.602]  And then I've got the company coming on that's building the emergency relocation centers.
[00:04:28.642 --> 00:04:31.404]  They've got one of the thousands of contracts.
[00:04:32.899 --> 00:04:34.221]  Building the FEMA Centers.
[00:04:34.281 --> 00:04:35.762]  We've got those folks coming on.
[00:04:35.783 --> 00:04:38.225]  And we've got some other guests as well.
[00:04:38.365 --> 00:04:43.331]  So it's a big show lined up for you on July 28, 2003.
[00:04:43.551 --> 00:04:52.281]  And yes, Bob Hope of Bohemian Grove fame has died.
[00:04:54.216 --> 00:04:58.463]  And, uh, we hope he went to heaven, but as a worshipper of Moloch, we're not too sure.
[00:04:58.984 --> 00:05:01.227]  I'm sorry, I should talk about him as a good guy.
[00:05:01.748 --> 00:05:07.376]  Okay, Moloch is a Christian deity, and, uh... Well, actually, that's not true, but we'll just say it is.
[00:05:07.396 --> 00:05:07.957]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:12.444]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:05:12.784 --> 00:05:18.431]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:24.017]  You haven't alkalized your body and in fact you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[00:05:24.237 --> 00:05:24.838]  You still use
[00:05:24.858 --> 00:05:32.524]  Use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella, the two most important protein superfoods known.
[00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:35.447]  Finally, you don't consume iodized water.
[00:05:35.707 --> 00:05:43.093]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[00:05:43.374 --> 00:05:47.457]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[00:05:47.757 --> 00:05:56.485]  If you want to learn more on how you can naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley, Monday through Friday mornings at 9 a.m.
[00:05:56.525 --> 00:05:57.786]  Central, 10 Eastern.
[00:05:57.946 --> 00:06:06.633]  Call 1-888-826-4448 to learn more, or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[00:06:06.913 --> 00:06:09.356]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[00:06:10.376 --> 00:06:13.239]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.241]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:06:15.461 --> 00:06:21.183]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:06:21.463 --> 00:06:26.724]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:06:27.025 --> 00:06:31.166]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:06:31.346 --> 00:06:35.127]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:06:35.387 --> 00:06:39.949]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:46.352]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:48.273]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:06:48.713 --> 00:06:50.794]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[00:06:50.894 --> 00:06:55.176]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.561]  You see, Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[00:07:04.761 --> 00:07:06.282]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:06.462 --> 00:07:08.543]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:07:09.244 --> 00:07:11.205]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:22.009]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:26.911]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:07:26.971 --> 00:07:38.295]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:07:38.895 --> 00:07:45.739]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:48.280]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:53.763]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[00:07:54.043 --> 00:08:00.186]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:08:00.206 --> 00:08:01.326]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[00:08:01.386 --> 00:08:02.247]  That's toll free!
[00:08:02.267 --> 00:08:02.307]  888-803-4438.
[00:08:14.496 --> 00:08:15.136]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.797 --> 00:08:16.858]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.558 --> 00:08:18.679]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.141]  You want answers?
[00:08:20.901 --> 00:08:21.822]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.463 --> 00:08:26.206]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.647 --> 00:08:30.751]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.569 --> 00:08:35.549]  All right, my friends.
[00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:40.591]  Again, it's another Monday, another week spanning out before us.
[00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:44.932]  And we do have several guests coming up today.
[00:08:44.992 --> 00:08:54.535]  We've got the spokesperson for one of the corporations involved in building the emergency relocation centers for your safety, of course.
[00:08:55.156 --> 00:08:58.997]  One of the quarantine centers joining us on the show.
[00:09:00.291 --> 00:09:05.173]  And we've got some other guests as well that I'll tell you about a little bit later in the broadcast.
[00:09:05.273 --> 00:09:13.115]  In the meantime, Bob Hope is dead at 100 years old.
[00:09:14.415 --> 00:09:17.876]  And, you know, the guy didn't seem like a bad person to me.
[00:09:17.896 --> 00:09:24.138]  He seemed like kind of that 1940s slapstick style of humor.
[00:09:24.158 --> 00:09:29.800]  I know that my grandmother, or grandmothers, like Bob Hope.
[00:09:30.788 --> 00:09:46.760]  But he does attend the Bohemian Grove, or did attend, and had been involved in some of the revelry there, according to the Washington Times and Spy Magazine and Esquire and other publications.
[00:09:48.661 --> 00:09:56.727]  But I wonder why they didn't mention that in his big obituary today, wall-to-wall all over the news, that Mr. Hope
[00:10:00.658 --> 00:10:04.782]  Was a worshipper of a Canaanite god.
[00:10:06.925 --> 00:10:08.726]  A child sacrifice god.
[00:10:09.327 --> 00:10:09.827]  I don't know.
[00:10:09.888 --> 00:10:14.953]  I think if I was famous and I worshipped an ancient Canaanite deity,
[00:10:16.287 --> 00:10:18.409]  I would think that that would be newsworthy.
[00:10:18.749 --> 00:10:20.371]  But again, maybe I'm being mean.
[00:10:20.831 --> 00:10:34.943]  Maybe I was bad last week when I read the San Francisco Chronicle saying that the Bohemian Grove Club and the Republican leadership have asked Arnold Schwarzenegger to run for governor at the Grove and they don't know if he will accept.
[00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:52.252]  Again, is it newsworthy that somebody who's going to run for governor and calls themselves a conservative is anti-gun, pro-abortion, his father was a Gestapo operator, and he goes to the Grove for the last 20 years?
[00:10:52.713 --> 00:10:53.133]  I don't know.
[00:10:54.711 --> 00:11:05.977]  Again, I ask the question, would you let your neighbor walk your dog or babysit your children if they worshipped a 45-foot stone owl in the backyard and committed mock human sacrifices?
[00:11:07.618 --> 00:11:17.263]  Because the Grove admits on the Trio Network and on the BBC and all over news and TV that I did sneak in three years ago and get the footage of them doing these rituals.
[00:11:18.547 --> 00:11:29.913]  It's like Tom Cruise running out of Eyes Wide Shut and saying, I've got video of what the world leaders do, and the news says, so what, we don't care, because we were there.
[00:11:30.833 --> 00:11:32.194]  Well, I guess that's kind of what happened.
[00:11:32.694 --> 00:11:36.276]  But this is for real, and I just thought I'd mention that for you.
[00:11:36.296 --> 00:11:43.339]  When we talk about Bob Hope, who's gone home now to meet his maker, wonder how he's doing.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:44.080]  Maybe he
[00:11:45.425 --> 00:11:47.886]  Repented for going to the Grove.
[00:11:48.747 --> 00:11:53.589]  I just think that when these people die, we need to really honestly look back on their lives.
[00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:57.071]  Oh, I may get criticized for this.
[00:11:57.131 --> 00:12:00.613]  Kind of like when I got on the air and I said, don't give money to the Red Cross.
[00:12:01.333 --> 00:12:02.934]  Don't give money to United Way.
[00:12:02.974 --> 00:12:04.475]  They're going to give it to gun grabbers.
[00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:14.182]  And I got a few mean emails and even a few stations got mad at me, but a few months later they were apologizing and saying, well, we just won't pick up an hour of your show.
[00:12:14.602 --> 00:12:18.063]  We'll pick up all three, because you were right about that.
[00:12:18.743 --> 00:12:22.505]  Alex, how did you know the Red Cross takes your money and gives it to gun grabbers?
[00:12:23.765 --> 00:12:26.446]  Well, because they did it in the past, and I have a long-term memory.
[00:12:27.826 --> 00:12:30.527]  How did I know that United Way is a criminal organization?
[00:12:30.567 --> 00:12:33.008]  Well, because they've been caught about ten times, folks.
[00:12:33.868 --> 00:12:34.749]  I mean, they're incredible.
[00:12:36.585 --> 00:12:40.487]  Again, I am almost cursed with a long-term memory.
[00:12:42.167 --> 00:13:03.616]  I remember with Oklahoma City, the Red Cross took over the, quote, mail to the families, and there would be checks handwritten by other family members to family members, and the Red Cross would endorse it over to themselves what bank would argue, and then arrogantly go on and mail the letter itself without the check to the families.
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:17.687]  That's the kind of stuff, the Red Cross is so evil, is so corrupt, is so dastardly, and I'm not talking about the useful idiots that go and volunteer for it.
[00:13:18.307 --> 00:13:22.970]  They're good people, but they empower an evil organization because they're ignorant.
[00:13:26.092 --> 00:13:28.813]  Oh, in fact, that's how this whole New World Order operates.
[00:13:28.853 --> 00:13:33.236]  They've got all these well-meaning saps who don't investigate anything.
[00:13:34.031 --> 00:13:37.592]  That don't look at a politician's voting record, but believe their rhetoric.
[00:13:37.632 --> 00:13:42.053]  That don't research the Red Cross United Way, just believe their rhetoric.
[00:13:42.173 --> 00:13:47.575]  And you give a nice face to some of the most evil groups out there.
[00:13:48.915 --> 00:13:51.395]  But again, same thing with Bob Hope.
[00:13:52.276 --> 00:13:56.697]  I can't really say the guy is evil.
[00:13:57.997 --> 00:14:00.798]  I could just say he was a member of the Bohemian Grove, which
[00:14:01.636 --> 00:14:11.683]  According to German chancellors and David Gergen and many others, in and out of US government, is a meeting house for a satanic cult.
[00:14:12.824 --> 00:14:14.525]  Now that's members saying this.
[00:14:15.766 --> 00:14:25.653]  Again, I just thought it might be added that, you know, when Anton LaVey died, they pointed out that he was the founder of the modern Church of Satan.
[00:14:26.814 --> 00:14:28.835]  And I think that that was proper to mention that.
[00:14:30.598 --> 00:14:32.339]  Anyway, it's just a side issue.
[00:14:34.821 --> 00:14:43.426]  Maybe you don't want to know about the Red Cross ripping you off and having telethons and the United Way having telethons and giving tens of millions to the gun grabbers.
[00:14:43.946 --> 00:14:45.387]  Maybe you want to lose your guns.
[00:14:45.467 --> 00:14:46.748]  Okay, all right.
[00:14:47.849 --> 00:14:58.435]  Maybe you want to be conned by Bush, Mr. Open Border, Mr. Supercomputer to China, Mr. Protect Bill Clinton and Block Dan Burton's Committee, Mr. Make the Vaccine Record Secret.
[00:15:00.396 --> 00:15:01.717]  Maybe you want to be kind.
[00:15:01.817 --> 00:15:03.218]  Maybe this isn't a show for you.
[00:15:03.418 --> 00:15:06.020]  Maybe you want to lose your guns and lose your sovereignty.
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:13.584]  Oh, by the way, the Republicans are set this week to vote on this so-called expansion of free trade bill.
[00:15:14.125 --> 00:15:18.047]  You've seen how wonderful NAFTA and GATT have been for the economy.
[00:15:19.728 --> 00:15:25.872]  They now have a bill for unlimited guest worker program, which is amnesty across the board.
[00:15:26.784 --> 00:15:29.246]  They will let them in, accept any ID card.
[00:15:30.107 --> 00:15:30.627]  Unlimited!
[00:15:30.687 --> 00:15:33.109]  It could be another $20 million, another $30 million.
[00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:38.754]  Unlimited means unlimited, and it'll be real good for your job.
[00:15:38.814 --> 00:15:41.316]  In fact, they won't have to ship them to India or China.
[00:15:41.896 --> 00:15:49.102]  I guess Boeing and Dell and everybody else can stay here like GM has done, from Michigan to Alabama.
[00:15:49.462 --> 00:15:53.005]  They just bring in the Russians and the Poles
[00:15:54.145 --> 00:16:23.540]  uh... to build the uh... trucks why they're even displacing the illegal aliens the uh... illegal uh... latin americans so uh... that's nice and of course they're they're paid about five dollars an hour and they work uh... sixty five to eighty hour work weeks the different articles say and they all live in one room apartments so you'll have six to ten guys living in a little uh... you know bedroom living room uh...
[00:16:24.884 --> 00:16:25.724]  Yeah, they are hard-working.
[00:16:51.326 --> 00:16:53.929]  And they're right at home with police and black ski masks.
[00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.933]  And they're right at home with face scanning cameras everywhere.
[00:16:56.953 --> 00:17:00.657]  And they're right at home with showing their papers and getting out and licking black boots.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.323]  Why, they're even more at home than the Mexicans are!
[00:17:06.925 --> 00:17:31.646]  And on top of it, how are you going to compete whether you're a Polish-American or a Black-American or a German-American or a Chinese-American who's a citizen who pays the property taxes and the state income taxes and the federal income taxes and the excise taxes and all these taxes, you pay all these taxes and all this stuff, how are you going to compete against
[00:17:32.498 --> 00:17:38.783]  Ten sweaty guys, whether they're from Mexico or Poland, in an efficiency apartment.
[00:17:41.565 --> 00:17:42.906]  How are you going to compete against that?
[00:17:43.446 --> 00:17:46.648]  With GM supplying the white van.
[00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:49.130]  How are you going to compete?
[00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:49.690]  You're not.
[00:17:49.711 --> 00:17:51.832]  It's going to drive all your wages down.
[00:17:52.092 --> 00:17:54.674]  But don't worry, your daughter can work in a topless bar.
[00:17:55.795 --> 00:18:00.138]  Your son can be a crack dealer, or maybe he can work on a golf course.
[00:18:00.678 --> 00:18:01.159]  I don't know.
[00:18:01.949 --> 00:18:05.654]  For all the government bureaucrats who make the $500,000 a year.
[00:18:06.695 --> 00:18:11.542]  Or the private corporations that get the contracts from the government bureaucrats.
[00:18:12.103 --> 00:18:13.925]  All part of the privatization.
[00:18:15.026 --> 00:18:17.049]  Yes, the new privatization.
[00:18:17.089 --> 00:18:18.351]  You mean the hijacking.
[00:18:20.326 --> 00:18:32.690]  The corporations finance a big government to get us all addicted, then they blow out the government and hand it over to the corporations and put a man with a black ski mask and a submachine gun on every corner and call it freedom.
[00:18:35.992 --> 00:18:38.513]  I don't know though, I've talked to some of these Poles and Russians.
[00:18:38.573 --> 00:18:42.414]  They seem to know about the New World Order, so maybe they won't make good citizens.
[00:18:43.593 --> 00:18:45.074]  Maybe they will stand up to tyranny.
[00:18:45.174 --> 00:18:49.975]  But they tend to know all about it, but say, oh, I'm going to keep my mouth shut.
[00:18:50.376 --> 00:18:52.596]  My father disappeared to the gulag.
[00:18:52.977 --> 00:18:54.417]  We never saw him again.
[00:18:56.278 --> 00:19:00.199]  We got word he was dumped into an underground lake in a salt mine.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:06.782]  Poor daddy, he smarted off when the policeman grabbed mommy's breast.
[00:19:08.729 --> 00:19:09.849]  Yeah, the little kids remember.
[00:19:09.889 --> 00:19:10.730]  I've talked to these guys.
[00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:27.236]  I mean, their dad would be there, you know, they'd be ten years old, one of these guys would come over in a black uniform, start questioning mommy, daddy would say no, and stand up to the guy, and well, daddy'd get punched right in the face and drug off.
[00:19:27.976 --> 00:19:30.417]  Don't worry, you're going to get to enjoy it.
[00:19:30.817 --> 00:19:32.237]  It's already begun.
[00:19:32.818 --> 00:19:36.219]  Don't worry, the new freedom, the new freedom is here.
[00:19:37.031 --> 00:19:38.892]  You're all going to get to enjoy it.
[00:19:39.973 --> 00:19:42.074]  You'll get to turn your guns in and be conservative.
[00:19:42.774 --> 00:19:44.496]  That's the conservative thing to do.
[00:19:44.976 --> 00:19:47.938]  Ultra-liberals are against gun control.
[00:19:48.238 --> 00:19:49.879]  Conservatives are for it.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.761]  We've heard the end cultures.
[00:19:53.981 --> 00:19:57.984]  How dare I say Bush shouldn't sign the assault weapons ban.
[00:19:59.004 --> 00:20:00.845]  I must be against the flag.
[00:20:00.865 --> 00:20:04.307]  The flag, but I go, but I'm for what the flag symbolizes.
[00:20:04.688 --> 00:20:06.549]  Shut up, that's just what liberals say.
[00:20:09.853 --> 00:20:17.358]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:20:17.659 --> 00:20:30.608]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[00:20:30.908 --> 00:20:34.229]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:45.031]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:45.811]  That's right!
[00:20:45.991 --> 00:20:53.113]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:20:53.393 --> 00:20:57.474]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter.

[00:22:09.352 --> 00:22:12.634]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a roadmap?
[00:22:12.814 --> 00:22:14.254]  And how easy it would be to get lost?
[00:22:14.575 --> 00:22:15.935]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[00:22:15.955 --> 00:22:18.296]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[00:22:18.737 --> 00:22:21.578]  Fortunately, there is a roadmap to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[00:22:21.618 --> 00:22:21.958]  coins.
[00:22:22.218 --> 00:22:23.479]  The Redbook Guide to U.S.
[00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:29.061]  Coins and History provides you with the knowledge you'll need to make informed decisions when it comes to collecting and investing in U.S.
[00:22:29.101 --> 00:22:30.042]  gold and silver coins.

[00:23:08.197 --> 00:23:16.699]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick, and you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:23:16.959 --> 00:23:22.260]  You haven't alkalized your body, and in fact you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:30.782]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella, the two most important protein superfoods known.
[00:23:31.102 --> 00:23:33.683]  Finally, you don't consume iodized water.
[00:23:33.963 --> 00:23:41.350]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:45.754]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[00:23:46.035 --> 00:23:54.763]  If you want to learn more on how you can naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley, Monday through Friday mornings at 9 a.m.

[00:24:29.492 --> 00:24:30.452]  All right, my friends.
[00:24:33.294 --> 00:24:34.234]  We're back live.
[00:24:35.155 --> 00:24:36.475]  Thanks for joining us today.
[00:24:36.495 --> 00:24:39.937]  The total free number to get involved on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:24:39.957 --> 00:24:40.197]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:24:40.218 --> 00:24:45.700]  But, I mean, I really have taken time out to talk to Russian and Polish immigrants to this country.
[00:24:54.628 --> 00:25:20.889]  And they know all about the New World Order, they understand the propaganda, and to hear the stories of their neighbors, or their uncle, or their father, who would complain because there wasn't proper safety measures at the smelting plant, and somebody got killed, and so they'd complain, and then men from the Communist Bureau would come and say, you've undermined the motherland,
[00:25:21.953 --> 00:25:26.376]  By lowering morale at this plant, you're a terrorist and they arrest him.
[00:25:27.477 --> 00:25:42.606]  They generally come so there wouldn't be too big a stir at home and knock on the door and dad would put his head down like a sheep off the slaughter and walk out with the men who would go put him in the back of the truck and take him off as a slave laborer.
[00:25:44.346 --> 00:25:46.768]  Or they'd working to death over 20-30 years.
[00:25:46.808 --> 00:25:52.312]  They found people in the camps, some of them that got released later, and they still run them today, who'd been there 30-40 years.
[00:25:54.193 --> 00:25:54.493]  U.S.
[00:25:54.533 --> 00:26:02.479]  veterans of World War II, they find them living, you know, and 85 years old now, after they got released when they were too old, from the camp.
[00:26:02.879 --> 00:26:06.642]  Because even the camp guards kind of had affection for them, you know, they'd been there so long.
[00:26:07.243 --> 00:26:11.105]  Old Americans taken out of the Nazi camps, and the Russians took them.
[00:26:11.165 --> 00:26:13.147]  It's admitted in congressional hearings,
[00:26:13.787 --> 00:26:18.528]  Our government knew 21,000 of our boys were taken by Stalin, but ah, who cares?
[00:26:18.768 --> 00:26:21.209]  It's patriotic not to care about the troops.
[00:26:21.609 --> 00:26:23.069]  Okay, then I don't care about them.
[00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:29.251]  I actually want to get our troops back from places like, like death camps in Russia, and that means I'm bad.
[00:26:29.551 --> 00:26:30.831]  I'm not patriotic.
[00:26:31.452 --> 00:26:32.832]  I'm evil, I admit it.
[00:26:33.757 --> 00:26:40.040]  Killing and slaughtering and letting our troops take deadly vaccines and huff radiation and sarin and VX.
[00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:41.581]  That's patriotism!
[00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:47.024]  Being a mindless, bug-eyed idiot with a power of pride sticker on your car.
[00:26:47.644 --> 00:26:51.626]  A mindless pride and a husk of what America once was.
[00:26:53.127 --> 00:27:01.211]  And you talk to these Poles and these Russians about, yes, our police wore these black uniforms and they started wearing masks and they said it was all for our own good and
[00:27:02.722 --> 00:27:09.008]  I talked to one guy about how his father was taken away, all because a police captain wanted his mother.
[00:27:09.028 --> 00:27:14.112]  And of course, his mother wouldn't have anything to do with it, so she later was taken too.
[00:27:14.212 --> 00:27:16.754]  But again, that's part of freedom.
[00:27:17.715 --> 00:27:23.841]  And the little boy went into the little youth work camp and got trained how to later go into the Soviet Army.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:29.824]  You know, for the homeland, we've got to have national service and national drafts.
[00:27:30.264 --> 00:27:31.005]  That's freedom.
[00:27:31.025 --> 00:27:32.566]  You're for the flag, aren't you?
[00:27:33.386 --> 00:27:36.629]  Imagine your mother and father drug away to death camps.
[00:27:36.929 --> 00:27:37.970]  That's freedom.
[00:27:39.191 --> 00:27:42.393]  Yes, that's big government, the power of the state.
[00:27:43.574 --> 00:27:47.297]  And they're setting it up here, but we should just lay down and go along with it.
[00:27:47.817 --> 00:27:52.821]  Alexander Solzhenitsyn was bad when he said that they should have fought and should have stood up.
[00:27:54.938 --> 00:27:56.459]  The second amendment's bad, folks.
[00:27:56.579 --> 00:27:57.479]  I agree with Bush.
[00:27:57.899 --> 00:28:05.043]  Let's just turn our guns in and let him sign the assault weapons ban and add to it the ban on all semi-automatic shotguns.
[00:28:06.363 --> 00:28:07.924]  Let's do the conservative thing.
[00:28:07.944 --> 00:28:10.285]  Can we all do that together now?
[00:28:10.885 --> 00:28:13.407]  Can we all listen to Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh?
[00:28:14.587 --> 00:28:18.449]  Who tell us how conservative they are all day but blind us to all the real news.
[00:28:20.965 --> 00:28:22.066]  I've been wrong all along.
[00:28:22.106 --> 00:28:24.307]  I'm beginning to realize that more and more on this show.
[00:28:24.348 --> 00:28:25.789]  I've been wrong all along.
[00:28:25.849 --> 00:28:27.029]  Big government's good.
[00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:29.711]  Entering into evil is good.
[00:28:30.912 --> 00:28:33.654]  The welfare state is good, as the neocons say.
[00:28:34.155 --> 00:28:42.541]  Ron Paul was bad to give that speech on July 10th, saying that George Bush and the neocons are the ultimate threat and are destroying America.
[00:28:42.721 --> 00:28:46.263]  How dare him have a record of conservatism, of real conservatism?
[00:28:46.564 --> 00:28:48.085]  I want the phony conservatism.
[00:28:48.345 --> 00:28:49.826]  I want to be a mindless idiot.
[00:28:51.474 --> 00:28:53.996]  That's what I want to be lied to and manipulated.
[00:28:55.377 --> 00:28:56.098]  Oh, and you know what?
[00:28:56.418 --> 00:29:04.144]  The troops are real upset about that they were told they'd be coming back from Iraq and the road almost through Baghdad, but they're all mad now and they're getting shot and killed.
[00:29:04.724 --> 00:29:07.046]  Well, how dare those troops criticize the government?
[00:29:07.466 --> 00:29:14.492]  They should all be arrested as working for Al-Qaeda if they criticize their commander and draft dodger chief.
[00:29:15.733 --> 00:29:20.156]  Their guy who was AWOL for a year from the Air National Guard.
[00:29:21.895 --> 00:29:23.597]  Again, that's a symbol of pride.
[00:29:24.257 --> 00:29:28.801]  By the way, the Drudge Report talked about how Bush signed an American flag, which is against the U.S.
[00:29:28.841 --> 00:29:31.803]  Code, but it said only George Bush can do that.
[00:29:32.184 --> 00:29:36.447]  He is our Commander-in-Chief and can do whatever he wants to the flag.
[00:29:36.888 --> 00:29:38.189]  Well, that's not true.
[00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:45.174]  And on top of it, I want to add, he's not Commander-in-Chief until Congress declares war.
[00:29:46.876 --> 00:29:48.097]  But again, he's just a puppet.
[00:29:48.951 --> 00:29:50.892]  Alright, enough out-of-control behavior.
[00:29:50.932 --> 00:29:54.975]  I'm going to launch straight into this plethora of vital news and take your calls.
[00:29:55.315 --> 00:29:56.756]  When we get back, stay with me.
[00:30:00.398 --> 00:30:01.299]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.779 --> 00:30:03.380]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.301 --> 00:30:07.023]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.183 --> 00:30:14.507]  I have tried many other diets to lose weight and I have not been successful.
[00:30:14.647 --> 00:30:19.592]  Here's more that have lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:19.792 --> 00:30:20.733]  With Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:20.753 --> 00:30:20.993]  800-419-2335 800-419-2335 800-419-2335
[00:30:46.571 --> 00:30:47.931]  Dehumanization.
[00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:53.094]  Imagine how pathetic it is to have an oppressive government
[00:30:53.937 --> 00:31:00.752]  Or even local police thugs can just arrest you and take you away to a forced labor camp if they want your wife.
[00:31:00.993 --> 00:31:03.999]  Or, more often, if they want your business.
[00:31:06.019 --> 00:31:07.521]  Or they want your customers.
[00:31:07.681 --> 00:31:09.503]  I mean, that's how tyranny works, folks.
[00:31:09.963 --> 00:31:18.151]  The local thugs set up their own little crime syndicates and the establishment doesn't care because that's the type of people they want working for them.
[00:31:18.431 --> 00:31:29.222]  Well, that's started now in New York and Chicago and Miami and Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon and Seattle, Washington and Houston, Texas.
[00:31:31.654 --> 00:31:34.097]  And then the reverse psychology begins.
[00:31:34.177 --> 00:31:37.301]  The people begin to worship the tyranny out of fear.
[00:31:37.882 --> 00:31:38.543]  They love it.
[00:31:38.623 --> 00:31:39.444]  They thank them.
[00:31:39.744 --> 00:31:44.330]  And it goes to the heads of the oppressors and they think, oh, it's our right to do this.
[00:31:48.405 --> 00:31:57.815]  And your daughters then grow up throwing themselves at the capos, at the mafiadons, at the government street-level thugs.
[00:31:58.415 --> 00:32:09.447]  This is the pattern of tyranny and serfdom and the pathetic mass of jellyfish that have been engineered into being slaves.
[00:32:11.784 --> 00:32:13.125]  What do you think about it, folks?
[00:32:13.185 --> 00:32:14.626]  What do you think about the New World Order?
[00:32:14.666 --> 00:32:16.006]  What do you think about slavery?
[00:32:16.046 --> 00:32:19.868]  Can you look at the news and see how America's been turned into a police state?
[00:32:20.329 --> 00:32:21.509]  Does it make you angry?
[00:32:21.529 --> 00:32:22.670]  Do you want to change it?
[00:32:22.930 --> 00:32:24.111]  Do you want to stop it?
[00:32:26.292 --> 00:32:31.535]  The toll-free number to join us on air today, on this live Monday edition, is 800-259-9231.
[00:32:31.735 --> 00:32:34.696]  And we'll go to your calls here in a moment.
[00:32:38.302 --> 00:32:39.323]  800-259-9231.
[00:32:40.384 --> 00:32:48.912]  And yes, my websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:32:50.033 --> 00:32:53.176]  This weekend, it hit me.
[00:32:54.317 --> 00:32:55.779]  I mean, it hit me between the eyes.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:02.405]  I was sitting there getting ready for a big radio show I was going on last night.
[00:33:04.295 --> 00:33:33.406]  On WLW, we were getting calls from North Carolina and Florida and Indiana on the Bill Beaushear Show for two hours, but I was there getting ready for the show and I had this pile of news articles that had been in my truck from when I'd been at one of the other studios doing a show with John Stattmiller, Saturday show we do, and I was looking at USA Today and I was looking at Television Week Magazine and I was looking at this AP article and it said
[00:33:34.728 --> 00:33:43.971]  Yeah, your television's listening to you with audio sensors and all the new cars have got audio sensors listening to you, hooked into Homeland Security.
[00:33:44.831 --> 00:33:58.435]  I had a Salt Lake City Tribune article about, yeah, the helicopters, the police helicopters have got ground penetrating radar and look through your walls, you know, crisp image.
[00:33:59.312 --> 00:34:05.941]  And I thought, you know, I've mentioned all this on the air many times, but there's no way to describe how horrible this is.
[00:34:07.182 --> 00:34:09.285]  All I do is desensitize you further.
[00:34:09.325 --> 00:34:10.867]  I get up here, I rant and rant about it.
[00:34:11.848 --> 00:34:17.015]  The average idiot driving along hasn't heard about it yet and will laugh at me and say, that's not true.
[00:34:17.771 --> 00:34:32.399]  Because that's part of the old paradigm, that stuff like this doesn't exist, and they're good at rationalizing things, and as soon as they read it in Time Magazine, they'll go, okay, it's good, I want it, watch me, listen to me, I love black helicopters!
[00:34:34.901 --> 00:34:40.744]  You know, it's like Ann Coulter when she was on this show, she was talking about government corruption, she goes, oh, black helicopters!
[00:34:43.894 --> 00:34:49.136]  And then if I was to confront her about black helicopters, there's hundreds of news articles, I said, yeah!
[00:34:50.217 --> 00:35:08.164]  I mean, they attacked Texas, they were all over the newspapers, burning buildings, firing Czechoslovakian troops, screaming, machine-gunning, things blowing up, foaming at the mouth, insanity, helicopters attacking buildings downtown, San Antonio explosions, police chiefs on the news saying they didn't authorize it, total bedlam,
[00:35:09.833 --> 00:35:11.174]  I mean, I got footage of all that.
[00:35:11.214 --> 00:35:12.474]  I got newscasts.
[00:35:12.835 --> 00:35:13.735]  I got AP.
[00:35:13.835 --> 00:35:15.216]  I got Kingsville Record.
[00:35:15.296 --> 00:35:17.297]  I got Austin American Statesman.
[00:35:17.357 --> 00:35:18.697]  I got World Net Daily.
[00:35:18.738 --> 00:35:20.358]  I got Charlotte Observer.
[00:35:20.438 --> 00:35:23.400]  I got police chiefs on video I interviewed.
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.121]  I got foreign troops.
[00:35:25.261 --> 00:35:27.602]  I got... But still, it doesn't matter.
[00:35:28.763 --> 00:35:30.243]  Oh yeah, it just doesn't matter to them.
[00:35:30.263 --> 00:35:31.484]  It's just a conspiracy theory.
[00:35:33.228 --> 00:35:39.631]  I mean, I live in a state where we routinely have foreign troops running around screaming, firing automatic weapons at 9 o'clock at night, unannounced.
[00:35:40.772 --> 00:35:53.898]  And the police just, uh, I got the police on the news going, well, we weren't allowed to tell the public, but once it started, we went out with our squad cars and said anyone outside their house would be arrested.
[00:35:55.859 --> 00:36:00.582]  I got the police chief in, uh, Alice, Texas going, well, there are foreign assets involved,
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:09.062]  I'm not at liberty to say... He actually talks like that, you know, the fake Texan talk about the puke.
[00:36:09.862 --> 00:36:15.284]  He started going, I'm not at liberty to say about it.
[00:36:18.585 --> 00:36:28.848]  This is the La La Land crazy world that we're living in, that we're facing, that we're dealing with.
[00:36:29.551 --> 00:36:35.135]  And I'm the weirdo for reading the Austin American Statesman about black helicopters.
[00:36:36.917 --> 00:36:58.873]  In fact, after weeks of this, six towns, not counting San Antonio, six towns and one big city getting hit, people having heart attacks, you know, the troops would go in 200 feet from a nursing home, Casa Ricarta in Kingsville, blowing up two buildings, fire shooting out, covertly leasing the buildings and then attacking them,
[00:37:00.515 --> 00:37:02.376]  This is all psychological warfare testing.
[00:37:02.537 --> 00:37:03.057]  It's admitted.
[00:37:03.097 --> 00:37:04.338]  The Rand Corporation admits it.
[00:37:04.358 --> 00:37:05.759]  This is all public.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.021]  The Statesman has.
[00:37:08.081 --> 00:37:10.543]  It says, South Texas invaded.
[00:37:10.603 --> 00:37:12.084]  Black helicopters attack.
[00:37:14.065 --> 00:37:21.311]  And then it says next to it, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones believes in black helicopters.
[00:37:22.792 --> 00:37:22.912]  Oh.
[00:37:23.533 --> 00:37:24.553]  So see, they're telling you.
[00:37:24.633 --> 00:37:26.455]  It's still not acceptable.
[00:37:27.578 --> 00:37:34.427]  Yes, we're going to throw it in your face, we're doing this, but you're still a weirdo like this guy if you don't like it.
[00:37:35.928 --> 00:37:46.882]  It said Alex Jones has been preaching about the black helicopters, the imaginary helicopters for years, and now it's come true, but it's really just training for your safety.
[00:37:48.702 --> 00:37:50.142]  Oh, now it had come true!
[00:37:50.202 --> 00:37:59.745]  I just had imagined there were these black helicopters attacking all over the country, and then magically, it just so happened to happen in Texas.
[00:38:01.245 --> 00:38:06.526]  And they were always quoting the same Delta Force people, the same Fort Bragg officials with the same quotes.
[00:38:07.306 --> 00:38:12.748]  Well, we do this for your safety, and this is the first type such training drill ever done.
[00:38:12.868 --> 00:38:14.188]  Your city is special.
[00:38:15.083 --> 00:38:18.386]  And then I have articles going back, you know, ten years before that with them doing it.
[00:38:19.427 --> 00:38:20.548]  And it's always the same story.
[00:38:20.588 --> 00:38:40.045]  They covertly show up, lease a government building, the government pulls out of the building two days before, and then, you know, five to fifteen helicopters attack, generally with foreigners, screaming, blowing buildings up, and then the police show up and go, you'll be arrested if you videotape this or criticize them!
[00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:45.033]  And news reporters show up and they grab their film.
[00:38:45.414 --> 00:38:47.096]  This is national security!
[00:38:47.697 --> 00:38:50.361]  By the way, I got an article here out of Time Magazine.
[00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:52.083]  Excuse me, it's out of Newsweek.
[00:38:52.905 --> 00:38:57.752]  There's two articles on this, but one out of Newsweek, and it says here...
[00:38:59.392 --> 00:39:13.247]  That, oh, people are planting marijuana on the public lands, and so the Army Rangers, don't be surprised if they need to search your vehicle or search your bags if you're out in the national parks.
[00:39:13.387 --> 00:39:15.169]  It's just the troops.
[00:39:16.756 --> 00:39:38.878]  And then in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where they had the fires, the fires have been put out, but the news reports, well, as part of Homeland Security, some of the troops are going to stay and patrol the parks, and they may not allow you into the parks, but again, they're the bosses now, and the feds said, quote, it's about desensitizing you to accept an end to posse comitatus.
[00:39:39.578 --> 00:39:41.180]  Any excuse to get that done?
[00:39:44.628 --> 00:39:46.550]  And now there's another headline here.
[00:39:47.371 --> 00:39:51.014]  California energy scam fraud traced to the White House.
[00:39:52.655 --> 00:39:57.900]  And it turns out that they were involved with Governor Gray Davis in the Enron scamming.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.840]  Well, we already knew that.
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.963]  It was already in the Sacramento Bee about two years ago.
[00:40:01.983 --> 00:40:06.427]  That he would buy, Governor Davis would, a megawatt for $147.
[00:40:06.667 --> 00:40:09.289]  He'd buy a megawatt from
[00:40:12.034 --> 00:40:14.475]  Enron, and then sell it back to them for a dollar.
[00:40:16.156 --> 00:40:18.157]  That's a nice markup there, isn't it?
[00:40:19.938 --> 00:40:26.702]  I mean, this is the type of news we've got here, and there is so much of it.
[00:40:27.462 --> 00:40:30.163]  So much vital news and information.
[00:40:30.724 --> 00:40:34.866]  Researchers helped define what makes a political conservative.
[00:40:34.886 --> 00:40:38.067]  You ought to see this UC Berkeley article, what the phony lefts up to them.
[00:40:38.087 --> 00:40:39.208]  I'm going to expose that later.
[00:40:40.259 --> 00:40:42.561]  First, I really should talk about the really important news.
[00:40:42.681 --> 00:40:46.223]  Lance Armstrong has won the Tour de France again.
[00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:48.544]  That's a joke, folks.
[00:40:48.624 --> 00:40:50.506]  I really shouldn't talk about such things.
[00:40:52.067 --> 00:40:53.407]  Also, U.S.
[00:40:53.568 --> 00:40:56.169]  hunts for Saddam around the Tigris River.
[00:40:56.409 --> 00:40:58.671]  Don't you want to bet they're about to find him?
[00:40:58.711 --> 00:41:00.572]  Of course, it'll be a dead body double.
[00:41:02.353 --> 00:41:05.875]  Old Saddam and the boys are in Belarus, according to press reports.
[00:41:06.016 --> 00:41:08.037]  I trust a lot more than this media.
[00:41:08.974 --> 00:41:31.891]  And by the way, we've reposted on Infowars.com some of the articles where they claim they killed him day one, and they claim they killed him at the end of the war, they claim they killed his sons a couple times, they were sure of it, they found the bodies, well now they show us these latest photos, and there's more holes than you can drive a hundred Mack trucks through, but
[00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.570]  U.S.
[00:41:34.590 --> 00:41:36.792]  hunts for Saddam around Tigris River.
[00:41:36.852 --> 00:41:37.673]  What do you think about this?
[00:41:37.693 --> 00:41:38.853]  You think the story's real?
[00:41:39.334 --> 00:41:42.536]  You think they really caught Saddam's sons?
[00:41:43.437 --> 00:41:44.597]  You think they really killed them?
[00:41:44.697 --> 00:41:57.246]  I mean, how can you believe a group that claim that trucks for pumping up balloons, for pumping up blimps, were bioweapons trucks when the British sold it to them and knew what it was?
[00:41:57.987 --> 00:42:00.028]  Who create fake Niger documents?
[00:42:00.969 --> 00:42:01.269]  U.S.
[00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:03.611]  hunts for Saddam around the Tigris River.
[00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:16.942]  American forces focused their hunt for Saddam Hussein around the Tigris River hometown and reported a near-miss Sunday in a raid to capture his new chief of security and perhaps the ousted dictator himself.
[00:42:17.022 --> 00:42:17.302]  A U.S.
[00:42:17.342 --> 00:42:19.584]  soldier was killed south of Baghdad.
[00:42:20.685 --> 00:42:23.147]  The latest death in a spike of guerrilla attacks.
[00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:26.410]  It says they killed five innocent people and a bunch of U.S.
[00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:27.151]  troops were killed.
[00:42:29.173 --> 00:42:31.134]  Five innocent Iraqis and five U.S.
[00:42:31.154 --> 00:42:31.475]  troops
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:34.301]  Dead this weekend.
[00:42:34.981 --> 00:42:39.704]  Abbott Bush has got the Hearst backed up to the plane, saying, hey, bring them on!
[00:42:42.046 --> 00:42:55.054]  Troops of the 4th Infantry Division, acting on tips from informants, hit three farms in Decrete region in the pre-dawn area, but learned their specific target, the security chief, had left the area the day before.
[00:42:55.474 --> 00:42:56.935]  We missed him by 24 hours.
[00:42:56.975 --> 00:43:01.458]  Lieutenant Colonel Steve Russell, who led the operation, and witnessed by the Associated Press reporter.
[00:43:02.561 --> 00:43:17.373]  By the way, most of these key embedded reporters, if they're not former colonels, or army chiefs, or admitted CIA, you look at their dossier, they've been part of the other government agencies.
[00:43:18.955 --> 00:43:25.380]  Here's that article I mentioned earlier, busted, and this particular one is out of time, there's another from Newsweek.
[00:43:25.931 --> 00:43:31.134]  Drug dealers are planting pot farms all over our national parks.
[00:43:31.515 --> 00:43:34.576]  Oh, and the Park Service is struggling to root them out.
[00:43:34.677 --> 00:43:36.237]  Time goes on a raid.
[00:43:37.338 --> 00:43:44.863]  Going in at dawn, rangers search for a marijuana farm in Tahoe National Forest.
[00:43:46.324 --> 00:43:49.546]  And it talks about park rangers working with the National Guard.
[00:43:51.462 --> 00:43:56.606]  ...are out there running around and you need to go ahead and go along with them because it'll keep you safe.
[00:43:59.968 --> 00:44:00.968]  Oh, it's amazing!
[00:44:01.168 --> 00:44:17.858]  Continuing... Look, I don't want to spend any time on this, but Bush, in a rally, was caught by a photograph, a photographer, signing an American flag, which violates the U.S.
[00:44:17.938 --> 00:44:20.560]  Code and they've tried to pass a constitutional amendment
[00:44:21.397 --> 00:44:22.337]  This is a red herring.
[00:44:23.698 --> 00:44:28.679]  The first amendment that the flag symbolizes states that you should be able to ride on the flag if you want to.
[00:44:28.839 --> 00:44:29.779]  I like the flag.
[00:44:29.799 --> 00:44:37.841]  I find it offensive to ride on it or desecrate it, but I find it more offensive to take that right away because that's what the flag symbolizes.
[00:44:37.861 --> 00:44:44.142]  You know, we're not blood and soil here like Germany where we mindlessly worship the flags, at least not yet.
[00:44:45.564 --> 00:44:59.856]  In this religious fervor, it came out that the high priest of phony patriotism, George W. Blueblood, from Kennebuckport, Maine, had signed the flag, George Bush.
[00:45:01.217 --> 00:45:08.884]  And everyone freaked out about it, but don't worry, Matt Drudge, another New World Order priest, told us that, hey, it's okay.
[00:45:09.764 --> 00:45:12.587]  The high priest is the only one, it actually says this,
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:19.424]  Only the commander-in-chief is allowed to burn a flag, cut a flag, write on a flag.
[00:45:20.084 --> 00:45:23.426]  He can change the rules whenever he wants, as our dictator.
[00:45:24.126 --> 00:45:25.727]  And so it's okay, it's okay.
[00:45:27.048 --> 00:45:29.929]  You know, four legs good, two legs bad.
[00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:39.575]  But you know, now it's okay for the pigs to start walking upright and saying, four legs okay, but two legs better.
[00:45:41.329 --> 00:45:46.473]  Okay, if you haven't read Animal Farm by George Orwell, you think I sound completely insane.
[00:45:46.493 --> 00:45:53.219]  It'll probably be in a New York Times article that Mr. Jones talks about pigs and walking on two legs.
[00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:56.201]  It's a book written by George Orwell.
[00:45:57.082 --> 00:45:58.042]  Gotta watch it, though.
[00:45:58.062 --> 00:45:58.923]  I'll get emails.
[00:46:00.905 --> 00:46:01.365]  Oh, boy.
[00:46:02.306 --> 00:46:05.869]  Again, I'm pro-Second Amendment, pro-national sovereignty.
[00:46:05.889 --> 00:46:08.751]  That means I'm an evil liberal, according to Ann Coulter.
[00:46:11.002 --> 00:46:13.964]  We'll come back and I promise we'll start going to your calls.
[00:46:14.985 --> 00:46:18.688]  Do you believe these are really the Saddam sons that have been killed?
[00:46:19.168 --> 00:46:24.112]  Can you believe anything comes out of the neocon mouthpieces of the mainstream media?
[00:46:25.913 --> 00:46:38.443]  What do you think about all the evidence coming out of Dick Cheney with the Energy Department months before 9-1-1 divvying up the Iraq oil saying it'll soon be ours?
[00:46:39.858 --> 00:46:41.919]  Now what do you think about the morale of the U.S.
[00:46:41.959 --> 00:46:43.179]  troops at rock bottom?
[00:46:43.779 --> 00:46:47.301]  And that now the Pentagon says it's going to prosecute troops that complain?
[00:46:49.601 --> 00:47:01.445]  I guess now, I mean, it's easy to ride around in your dually and say you support the troops, but does that mean allowing them to be nerve gassed and hit with depleted uranium by our government?
[00:47:02.926 --> 00:47:06.427]  Again, if you really support the troops, you'll have to find out what's happened to them.
[00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:21.812]  And, uh, there's a bunch of other news here, but it really shows how petty things have gotten, that people are criticizing Bush now for writing on one of these desecrated Chinese flags.
[00:47:22.452 --> 00:47:29.633]  I mean, it's a thousand times worse that the flags are made, admittedly, in some of the slave camps of China.
[00:47:29.653 --> 00:47:33.694]  I've done my own little study in stores.
[00:47:34.614 --> 00:47:37.715]  About one out of twenty flags you find is made in America.
[00:47:38.707 --> 00:47:40.327]  I have found a few that are made in America.
[00:47:41.088 --> 00:47:43.928]  Most of them, if not all, are made in Taiwan or China.
[00:47:45.249 --> 00:47:46.629]  And Taiwan's not that bad.
[00:47:46.649 --> 00:47:49.270]  I mean, they got more freedom than China, but it's a lot worse.
[00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:52.750]  You know, Drudge, why do you care if Bush signs a flag?
[00:47:54.191 --> 00:47:59.092]  That's nothing compared to the fact that people are running around with flags made by slaves.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.382]  I mean, if you respect the American flag, give me a break.
[00:48:03.002 --> 00:48:04.403]  All these things should be burned.
[00:48:04.423 --> 00:48:06.024]  And you're like, what do you mean, you traitor?
[00:48:06.604 --> 00:48:13.208]  That's how you're supposed to dispose of a flag that has been misused or desecrated.
[00:48:13.488 --> 00:48:18.571]  As long as we're going to have the religion of flag worship, let's practice it properly.
[00:48:20.152 --> 00:48:21.393]  Okay, enough ranting and raving.
[00:48:21.413 --> 00:48:22.414]  We will get to your calls.
[00:48:22.434 --> 00:48:22.674]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:48:22.694 --> 00:48:23.354]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:23.374 --> 00:48:24.035]  Stay with us.
[00:48:31.042 --> 00:48:40.185]  Enzyme Phytonutrient, or EPN, is a new all-in-one combination of enzymes and saccharides necessary for optimal cellular communication.
[00:48:40.825 --> 00:48:50.929]  EPN is created using a unique 14-day process resembling human digestion, in which soy seeds are completely assimilated into basic nutrients and natural sweeteners.
[00:48:50.949 --> 00:48:57.211]  Enzymes are complex proteins found in digestive juices, causing food to break down at an accelerated rate.
[00:48:57.751 --> 00:49:03.373]  Phytonutrients come from plants which provide important protective substances called phytochemicals.
[00:49:03.573 --> 00:49:06.574]  Saccharides are known to be important in cellular communication.
[00:49:07.114 --> 00:49:09.895]  One tablespoon before each meal is all that is needed.
[00:49:10.295 --> 00:49:23.179]  The diseases EPN may be helpful in relieving are too numerous to mention here, so call Clipscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for more information about this exciting new dietary supplement.
[00:49:23.719 --> 00:49:30.045]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[00:49:30.986 --> 00:49:41.736]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:49:41.896 --> 00:49:47.021]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria.
[00:49:47.281 --> 00:49:47.721]  I think so.
[00:50:05.666 --> 00:50:09.567]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:50:09.607 --> 00:50:11.508]  The water level is always visible.
[00:50:11.688 --> 00:50:17.630]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:21.811]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:50:21.831 --> 00:50:22.412]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:50:30.634 --> 00:50:34.977]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:35.157 --> 00:50:39.580]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:44.103]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:44.163 --> 00:50:45.504]  The New World Order.
[00:50:46.284 --> 00:50:46.985]  Can emerge.
[00:50:47.265 --> 00:50:48.046]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:01.237 --> 00:51:01.697]  We're good to go.
[00:51:35.954 --> 00:51:37.856]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:51:38.356 --> 00:51:41.159]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:44.702 --> 00:51:57.294]  Alright, we got Dr. McCulloch coming on, the head of this corporation that builds the little prefab relocation centers, the safety centers.
[00:51:58.517 --> 00:51:58.898]  I think?
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:32.625]  The company, there's hundreds of these companies, they have a quick little prefab isolation system and the government said we're going to be hit by biologicals because, you know, they'll get more power and control and they want to save us and they're going to give themselves the opportunity to save us, save us from our liberties and freedoms.
[00:52:33.045 --> 00:52:37.246]  So that's coming up in about 15 minutes and I got another guest coming on from Canada.
[00:52:37.958 --> 00:52:38.839]  Good to talk to you, TJ.
[00:52:38.919 --> 00:52:39.459]  It's been a while.
[00:52:39.479 --> 00:52:41.060]  There's a tape coming to John.
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.742]  You and Violet are welcome to listen to it in the next 10 days, too.
[00:53:02.011 --> 00:53:15.401]  The only flags I have a tremendous respect for right now is the Jones family flag, which said, Don't Tread on Me, designed by that famous naval officer, John Paul Jones, and the Confederate flags.
[00:53:15.461 --> 00:53:17.282]  And that's an unfortunate circumstance.
[00:53:17.322 --> 00:53:26.189]  But regarding commanders and chiefs, I have in front of me a Naval Blue Jackets manual, original copyright, 1938.
[00:53:26.229 --> 00:53:26.889]  Unfortunately, Alex,
[00:53:30.191 --> 00:53:34.974]  Whether you call him the Commander-in-Chief or otherwise, he's the boss.
[00:53:35.134 --> 00:53:40.497]  Because the Secretary of the Navy is the highest-ranking naval officer, even though he's a civilian.
[00:53:41.337 --> 00:53:49.782]  And unfortunately, most unfortunately, he is a direct appointee of the President with the approval of the Senate.
[00:53:49.802 --> 00:53:51.803]  These are unfortunate circumstances.
[00:53:52.263 --> 00:53:57.786]  By the way, the guy who was about to be Secretary of the Navy committed suicide again
[00:53:58.775 --> 00:54:04.273]  Yeah, that is a fragmented news story that you can only hear at about 3 a.m.
[00:54:04.393 --> 00:54:05.056]  on network.
[00:54:06.006 --> 00:54:07.727]  I hope you'll elaborate on that.
[00:54:07.787 --> 00:54:08.488]  God bless you.
[00:54:08.508 --> 00:54:09.468]  I'm out of here, Alex.
[00:54:09.669 --> 00:54:10.069]  All right.
[00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:11.050]  Thank you, TJ.
[00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:13.111]  Yes, it's very interesting.
[00:54:13.831 --> 00:54:21.716]  I do have a Reuters, UPI, NAP article, but they're claiming now he might have had cancer again, and maybe he did commit suicide.
[00:54:21.756 --> 00:54:22.697]  I mean, he's a globalist.
[00:54:23.277 --> 00:54:27.800]  The Dr. David Kelly subject, though, everything points away from suicide.
[00:54:28.381 --> 00:54:29.381]  Tom in Texas.
[00:54:29.401 --> 00:54:30.142]  Go ahead, Tom.
[00:54:30.182 --> 00:54:30.862]  You're on the air.
[00:54:31.363 --> 00:54:31.703]  Yes, sir.
[00:54:32.924 --> 00:54:35.546]  And God bless you, and I pray for you all the time.
[00:54:35.946 --> 00:54:36.807]  You sound like me.
[00:54:37.027 --> 00:54:44.231]  I'm 44 years old, and I've been on this stuff for all my life since my granddaddy told me about this.
[00:54:44.271 --> 00:54:48.814]  Anyway, I've called up a lot of congressmen.
[00:54:49.755 --> 00:54:56.379]  I've taken some of this stuff off the InfoWars, and I wrote it down on about three or four pages of nothing but congressmen, senators, all of them.
[00:54:56.419 --> 00:55:00.682]  I called every one of them up here about two weeks ago, got on them, bought me a calling card.
[00:55:01.716 --> 00:55:03.057]  And I told them what I felt about him.
[00:55:03.317 --> 00:55:05.639]  I was real discreet now.
[00:55:07.521 --> 00:55:07.881]  But I did.
[00:55:07.921 --> 00:55:11.544]  I've been working on it, Alex.
[00:55:12.204 --> 00:55:15.347]  Tom, it's very important that they know that we know.
[00:55:15.687 --> 00:55:15.947]  Right.
[00:55:16.308 --> 00:55:18.109]  That we're aware of what they're doing.
[00:55:18.189 --> 00:55:20.751]  That can and will back them off.
[00:55:20.991 --> 00:55:21.412]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:22.232 --> 00:55:28.598]  And I told them that John Ashcroft, I can't name all of them I talked to, but they're over 50.
[00:55:30.721 --> 00:55:36.407]  Uh, I talked to, uh, and told him that John Ashcroft needs no expansion of powers.
[00:55:37.868 --> 00:55:39.269]  As a matter of fact, you need to repeal it.
[00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:40.550]  He doesn't need that.
[00:55:41.151 --> 00:55:42.732]  He doesn't even know how to use the power he's got.
[00:55:42.752 --> 00:55:45.335]  And, uh, I mean, I told him flat out, man.
[00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:47.617]  I'm talking about, I got in some conversation with him, too.
[00:55:48.237 --> 00:55:50.419]  Used up several calling cards, but that's how I'm doing it.
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:55.204]  And the helicopters are flying around all over the place up here in Lake Livingston, man.
[00:55:56.095 --> 00:55:56.975]  They're all over.
[00:55:57.955 --> 00:56:01.496]  The Black Apaches are all over the place up here.
[00:56:01.716 --> 00:56:03.537]  Keeping you safe, Tom.
[00:56:03.737 --> 00:56:04.337]  Yeah, right.
[00:56:04.797 --> 00:56:06.677]  Tom, anything else you'd like to add?
[00:56:06.957 --> 00:56:09.138]  Well, what about John Dane?
[00:56:09.158 --> 00:56:10.178]  What do you think about him?
[00:56:10.398 --> 00:56:11.098]  Hey, I'll tell you what.
[00:56:11.158 --> 00:56:11.658]  Stay there.
[00:56:11.758 --> 00:56:12.479]  We'll come back.
[00:56:13.079 --> 00:56:14.539]  We'll let you elaborate, Tom.
[00:56:14.699 --> 00:56:17.200]  Then we'll go to John, John, and many others.
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.460]  Then we've got a guest coming on.
[00:56:21.132 --> 00:56:27.334]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident... Would you be prepared?
[00:56:28.035 --> 00:56:38.278]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:46.756 --> 00:56:47.396]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.057 --> 00:56:49.117]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:49.818 --> 00:56:50.918]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.579 --> 00:56:52.399]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.159 --> 00:56:54.060]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:58.662]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.902 --> 00:57:03.024]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:08.007 --> 00:57:09.108]  All right, my friends.
[00:57:09.208 --> 00:57:11.509]  We're already into the second hour.
[00:57:12.555 --> 00:57:24.768]  We have the head of the Daedalus Corporation, Dr. McCulloch, coming on the show with their emergency quarantine camp centers, safety, love, happy clown centers.
[00:57:25.829 --> 00:57:27.010]  That's coming up.
[00:57:28.303 --> 00:57:39.553]  And of course your calls, and we have some of the folks coming on that are fighting the forced registration and confiscation of guns in Canada, where mass disobedience, civil disobedience is now taking place.
[00:57:40.273 --> 00:57:42.635]  Right now, Tom in Texas, then John and others.
[00:57:43.076 --> 00:57:45.518]  Tom, go ahead and finish up with another point you had to make.
[00:57:45.978 --> 00:57:46.299]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:46.359 --> 00:57:50.562]  I was just wanting to know what you thought about Howard Dean, one of the running mates there.
[00:57:51.443 --> 00:57:52.504]  It was 16 questions.
[00:57:52.524 --> 00:57:55.727]  Have you heard about the 16 questions he gave for Bush, you know?
[00:57:56.874 --> 00:57:58.855]  Why don't you elaborate on those 16?
[00:57:59.115 --> 00:58:15.584]  Okay, it says, Mr. President, beyond the NSC and the CIA officials who have been identified, we need to know who else at the White House was involved in the decision to include discredited uranium evidence in your speech.
[00:58:16.244 --> 00:58:20.386]  And if they knew it was false, why didn't they permit it to be introduced into the speech?
[00:58:21.195 --> 00:58:37.540]  Mr. President, we need to know why anyone in your administration wouldn't have contemplated using evidence on State of the Union after the Georgia tenant personally intervened on October 2002 to have the same evidence removed from the President's speech October 7th.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:40.141]  I mean, this goes down.
[00:58:40.181 --> 00:58:44.182]  Mr. President, we need an explanation about the very serious charges.
[00:58:44.975 --> 00:58:52.421]  Yeah, but you notice what's happening is the liberals are engaging in the assault on Bush.
[00:58:52.581 --> 00:58:57.865]  That will make conservatives shift into mindless groupthink and support the president.
[00:58:58.225 --> 00:59:03.549]  We need to have criticism of Bush and the liberals that he's with by people like Ron Paul.
[00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:04.930]  But yes, it's all true.
[00:59:05.271 --> 00:59:06.452]  They're a pack of liars.
[00:59:07.132 --> 00:59:14.478]  The Pentagon told us last year that the Office of Strategic Information was going to be reauthorized to quote lie to us.
[00:59:15.504 --> 00:59:19.967]  So they kind of covered themselves beforehand that, oh, this is our new policy.
[00:59:20.568 --> 00:59:21.268]  I'll be doggone.
[00:59:21.668 --> 00:59:23.490]  But, yeah, it's just incredible.
[00:59:23.570 --> 00:59:29.634]  Man, the main thing we need to do, and I love you, man, as a brother.
[00:59:29.654 --> 00:59:30.875]  I don't know how to explain that.
[00:59:30.915 --> 00:59:32.136]  You're just awesome.
[00:59:32.316 --> 00:59:35.578]  You remind me of myself and my brother, too.
[00:59:35.698 --> 00:59:36.459]  He lives on the lake.
[00:59:38.415 --> 00:59:41.078]  We love you, we're praying for you, and we've got to pray.
[00:59:41.138 --> 00:59:50.548]  What we've got to do with all this here, not to be fearful, but to be strong and bold and back up the Word of God with it and pray about this.
[00:59:50.588 --> 00:59:51.970]  I think we can set this back.
[00:59:51.990 --> 00:59:58.617]  We're not going to stop this, you know, if it's part of Scripture of the last days, but I believe God wants to still save some souls.
[00:59:59.312 --> 01:00:00.953]  I believe we can still make a difference.
[01:00:01.053 --> 01:00:03.014]  Oh yeah, we've got a job.
[01:00:03.354 --> 01:00:03.755]  You're right.
[01:00:04.075 --> 01:00:07.216]  We've got a job to warn people so they won't be sucked in by this system.
[01:00:07.397 --> 01:00:07.897]  Exactly.
[01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.218]  Thanks for the call, Tom.
[01:00:10.038 --> 01:00:11.659]  Really wonderful points, I appreciate it.
[01:00:12.039 --> 01:00:14.020]  John in Georgia, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:00:15.141 --> 01:00:15.521]  Georgia?
[01:00:16.061 --> 01:00:16.462]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:16.562 --> 01:00:24.266]  I appreciate you pointing out a lot of the things about how the media overtly lies to us, but I also wanted to point out a story that's
[01:00:24.833 --> 01:00:41.040]  Kind of a regional story with national implications that's been largely overlooked by the national media, which is the case of Judge Roy Moore in Alabama, who has been fighting a federal court order to remove Ten Commandments from the Alabama Supreme Courthouse.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:51.384]  A ruling from the 11th District Court came down in Atlanta last week, and the feds might quite possibly move to actively remove that against
[01:00:52.079 --> 01:00:53.400]  The state of Alabama this week.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:59.364]  Well, that's the first thing Ashcroft did when he got in office was raid a church and take down some Ten Commandments.
[01:01:00.445 --> 01:01:04.008]  And, look, our Magna Carta came out of the Ten Commandments.
[01:01:04.288 --> 01:01:07.471]  Our Bill of Rights and Constitution came out of the Magna Carta.
[01:01:07.491 --> 01:01:14.276]  Remember that court in Kentucky a few years ago that ruled the Declaration of Independence was unconstitutional?
[01:01:14.996 --> 01:01:15.857]  Yes, sir, I do.
[01:01:15.917 --> 01:01:18.619]  Now, there is no separation of church and state.
[01:01:18.679 --> 01:01:19.840]  That's a made-up thing.
[01:01:21.076 --> 01:01:26.399]  What there is in the First Amendment is that the government can't get involved in controlling churches.
[01:01:26.419 --> 01:01:27.699]  I agree.
[01:01:27.719 --> 01:01:30.901]  And the Ten Commandments is part of our Bill of Rights.
[01:01:30.921 --> 01:01:36.764]  I tell you what, I got this guest coming up, but for just 15 minutes, stay there John in Georgia, John in Tennessee, and others.
[01:01:37.144 --> 01:01:38.885]  I'll get to you after this guest is on.
[01:01:38.905 --> 01:01:39.265]  Stay with us.
[01:01:42.623 --> 01:01:43.583]  Toxins are everywhere.
[01:01:43.603 --> 01:01:54.208]  They're in the air you breathe, in the food you eat, in the water you drink, and as a result, illness and disease have increased to the point that eventually we're all going to get sick with something, unless we find a way to get these toxins and metals out of the body.
[01:01:54.648 --> 01:02:00.171]  EDTA chelation treatments cost about $100 each, and take several hours at the doctor's office, not to mention the discomfort.
[01:02:00.491 --> 01:02:01.952]  But now, there's Detoxamine.
[01:02:02.312 --> 01:02:07.414]  This chelation suppository is a major breakthrough and is destined to revolutionize the way we detox our bodies.
[01:02:07.774 --> 01:02:09.615]  How much would you pay for 10 chelation treatments?
[01:02:09.895 --> 01:02:12.297]  Well, you can get approximately the same amount of chelating for only $2.89.95.
[01:02:14.018 --> 01:02:15.739]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:02:16.219 --> 01:02:23.023]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit thepowerhour.com to order Detoxamine today.
[01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:28.986]  Hey, get the lead out, along with the mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and all the other stuff that gunks up your arteries and organs.
[01:02:29.466 --> 01:02:33.587]  Dr. Bruce Halstead, the grandfather of chelation, says Detoxamine works, and it does.
[01:02:33.927 --> 01:02:40.349]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit ThePowerHour.com and detoxify with Detoxamine.
[01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:45.851]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:46.031 --> 01:02:50.472]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:50.612 --> 01:02:54.993]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[01:02:55.093 --> 01:02:56.354]  A New World Order.
[01:02:57.174 --> 01:02:58.095]  Panama.
[01:02:58.155 --> 01:03:02.377]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:03:02.437 --> 01:03:09.381]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:03:09.501 --> 01:03:11.562]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:03:11.742 --> 01:03:22.308]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:03:22.508 --> 01:03:23.008]  If you want to
[01:03:23.148 --> 01:03:24.670]  I don't understand what the New World Order really is.
[01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:27.914]  In my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3 is for you!
[01:03:28.374 --> 01:03:30.997]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:03:31.017 --> 01:03:31.598]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:03:31.638 --> 01:03:32.159]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:32.179 --> 01:03:33.440]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:03:40.809 --> 01:03:43.810]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:49.071]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:03:49.311 --> 01:03:53.671]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:03:53.952 --> 01:04:02.873]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:06.694]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:04:06.994 --> 01:04:12.023]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons for one year, whichever comes first.
[01:04:12.324 --> 01:04:19.076]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:04:19.556 --> 01:04:20.097]  What about you?
[01:04:20.837 --> 01:04:26.179]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:04:43.709 --> 01:04:49.751]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:50.351 --> 01:04:53.392]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:56.673 --> 01:05:05.977]  Alright my friends, we are now 8 minutes and 20 seconds into the second hour of this worldwide edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:05.997 --> 01:05:09.918]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net,
[01:05:11.534 --> 01:05:16.115]  And we are joined by Dr. Ed McCulloch.
[01:05:17.076 --> 01:05:21.997]  He is the head of the Daedalus Project.
[01:05:22.257 --> 01:05:25.138]  Daedalus was the father of Icarus.
[01:05:25.158 --> 01:05:26.118]  Remember Icarus?
[01:05:26.898 --> 01:05:35.280]  He basically used the hot wax to put the feathers on his shoulders and arms and flew up to the sun.
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:37.121]  Thought he could be like the gods, but
[01:05:37.845 --> 01:05:43.930]  The feathers, the wax got hot and he fell back to earth.
[01:05:44.551 --> 01:05:45.512]  Interesting name!
[01:05:45.532 --> 01:05:58.263]  A lot of listeners are concerned about Homeland Security, page 76 of the package, forced inoculation, forced internment during a smallpox or other biological release.
[01:05:58.863 --> 01:06:01.706]  The Council on Foreign Relations in their last report
[01:06:02.512 --> 01:06:06.735]  Said that Denver, Dallas, Cleveland, quote, will be hit by smallpox.
[01:06:06.775 --> 01:06:13.238]  I don't know how they could say will be hit, but Gary Hart also said that on Hannity and Combs.
[01:06:13.298 --> 01:06:14.199]  I have that on tape.
[01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:24.345]  And so now they're all over the country preparing for mass destruction attacks, building different FEMA centers and things, but specifically,
[01:06:25.377 --> 01:06:31.659]  We're joined by Dr. Ed McCulloch and we've got a PR Newswire story here.
[01:06:31.679 --> 01:06:33.039]  I've got an AP article here.
[01:06:33.739 --> 01:06:43.222]  A SARS-BioTerra Fears Grow prototype isolation and treatment facility to be built in Pittsburgh area beginning in mid-August.
[01:06:43.522 --> 01:06:52.744]  The three Northern Virginia companies today announced plans to assemble a prototype facility outside of Pittsburgh next month that could be used for isolating
[01:06:54.076 --> 01:07:02.803]  Patients in the event of a terrorist attack and it's a prototype of a larger 500 bed facility and to tell us all about it is Dr. McCulloch.
[01:07:03.243 --> 01:07:04.444]  Thanks for coming on the show, sir.
[01:07:04.985 --> 01:07:05.765]  Certainly my pleasure.
[01:07:05.805 --> 01:07:06.146]  Thank you.
[01:07:07.146 --> 01:07:17.735]  Tell us about Daedalus and about your company and about some of the projects it works on and about this new facility that you're going to be building in Pittsburgh.
[01:07:19.752 --> 01:07:33.902]  I think the important point here is that Daedalus was principally focused upon the development of materials to create extremely low-cost housing in the emerging markets of the developing world.
[01:07:34.783 --> 01:07:48.813]  As it turns out, in our view, there are probably few materials available that provide the same structural integrity, the same projected longevity, and the same sense of dignity as the materials we have designed.
[01:07:49.744 --> 01:07:53.045]  So, we had never really intended to be in the U.S.
[01:07:53.085 --> 01:07:53.925]  domestic market.
[01:07:54.745 --> 01:08:12.110]  We simply recognized through one of our associates that a requirement existed to have a low-cost response capability that could put up a 500-bed facility within about 24 to 48 hours, and perhaps a 1,000-bed facility within 48 to 72 hours.
[01:08:19.233 --> 01:08:33.088]  Now, the different news articles, and correct them if they're wrong, they say this 150-bed facility is a facility for the public and the government and the media to get a good look at.
[01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:41.097]  Hopefully, I guess, to sell the system out there competing with the others that are bidding on the government contracts.
[01:08:42.190 --> 01:08:44.512]  Well, I'm not sure if that's correct or not.
[01:08:44.612 --> 01:08:49.255]  I don't know of any potential government contracts for this particular development.
[01:08:50.056 --> 01:09:07.488]  As it turns out, this particular facility is under a government-funded contract through Allegheny County in Pittsburgh, where they have one of the more advanced or perhaps leading-edge groups involved in both civil preparedness and disaster response.
[01:09:08.524 --> 01:09:20.376]  This particular item, this particular demonstration, will in fact demonstrate that this particular low-cost material is applicable to this role and several other roles.
[01:09:20.856 --> 01:09:29.165]  So it really goes from this kind of facility through several others including just neighborhood health and any kind of natural disaster response.
[01:09:29.445 --> 01:09:32.548]  Now the news calls it high-tech advanced system.
[01:09:33.465 --> 01:09:34.789]  What are the buildings made of?
[01:09:34.809 --> 01:09:37.176]  How do you put up a 500 bed facility in 24, 48 hours?
[01:09:39.562 --> 01:09:45.124]  The original intent of these was to make them from glass-reinforced recycled plastic.
[01:09:46.124 --> 01:09:50.686]  So the panels, as they were originally designed, contain about 20% recycled plastic.
[01:09:51.046 --> 01:09:55.568]  They're a very low-cost building material, and they will be assembled in sections.
[01:09:55.688 --> 01:09:57.609]  They're made in individual panels.
[01:09:57.649 --> 01:10:01.470]  The panels are assembled, and then the panel sections will be stood up.
[01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:03.351]  So this is a relatively
[01:10:04.415 --> 01:10:07.436]  A relatively fast system to assemble.
[01:10:07.837 --> 01:10:16.440]  But it's very strong, so it's a type of silicate compound with... More accurately defined, I think, as a glass-reinforced polymer.
[01:10:17.321 --> 01:10:27.105]  Essentially, the polyolefins, or the plastics that we're more familiar with, like polyethylene, polypropylene, and an amount of fiberglass reinforcement.
[01:10:27.706 --> 01:10:32.868]  Now, they've said that during a quarantine, people are going to be locked up in these things
[01:10:33.849 --> 01:10:42.532]  For everyone's safety, so they don't spread the pathogen, how does your facility provide that level of containment?
[01:10:43.093 --> 01:10:47.234]  Well, I think that's a little inaccurate, or perhaps a little severe.
[01:10:47.734 --> 01:10:59.439]  The real notion here is that these facilities would provide the opportunity for observation, for isolation, excuse me, for observation, for quarantine, and isolation.
[01:11:00.208 --> 01:11:04.109]  So in fact you would presumably have three different kinds of patients.
[01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:07.910]  Those who believe that perhaps they've been exposed but don't really know.
[01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:16.733]  Those who have been exposed for certain and those who have been exposed for certain and exhibit certain features of a particular disease.
[01:11:17.833 --> 01:11:24.455]  Yeah, but I mean they have the guy in Dallas who they thought had SARS and he wanted to leave the hospital and they wouldn't let him and chained him down to the bed.
[01:11:24.635 --> 01:11:26.836]  Yeah, that's not a part of Daedalus activity.
[01:11:26.856 --> 01:11:29.697]  Daedalus is really working on the structural side of this.
[01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:45.165]  And integrating what we consider to be the non-medical life support system, so essentially the hotel services, the mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC, and the medical systems.
[01:11:45.665 --> 01:11:51.211]  Wow, and in 48 hours, having a system with power and water and everything?
[01:11:52.771 --> 01:12:00.893]  So what do you have, like trucks that have nodules of different services, and then they all show up, put the frame together, and then stick the appliances in?
[01:12:01.213 --> 01:12:01.853]  That is correct.
[01:12:01.913 --> 01:12:15.916]  In the case of the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, the HVAC provider, that's really being done by Albancat, called Albancat Rental Solutions of Elkridge, Maryland, and they are a Caterpillar provider.
[01:12:16.136 --> 01:12:16.856]  So there is a
[01:12:17.723 --> 01:12:18.264]  Okay, now
[01:12:29.773 --> 01:12:36.019]  I understand you're in the composite materials and the new solutions and the infrastructure of this.
[01:12:36.779 --> 01:12:38.301]  And on the planning side, that's correct.
[01:12:38.581 --> 01:12:41.143]  We cover and track this occasionally here on the show.
[01:12:41.244 --> 01:12:47.890]  I have Detroit Free Press, I have Newsmax, I have Rocky Mountain News, or FEMA.
[01:12:48.690 --> 01:12:57.376]  Last year, by January 1st of this year, wanted 3, 1 million man emergency cities already set up.
[01:12:57.876 --> 01:13:00.958]  Were you aware of those contracts or are you involved in those?
[01:13:00.978 --> 01:13:03.600]  No, we're not either aware of them nor a part of them.
[01:13:05.820 --> 01:13:08.501]  I wonder why they need 1 million person facilities.
[01:13:08.541 --> 01:13:09.421]  That's pretty big.
[01:13:09.661 --> 01:13:23.946]  Well, I think the HRSA requirement from Health and Human Services is actually a surge capacity nationwide for a variety of reasons, including natural disasters, simply for 500 beds per million population.
[01:13:24.927 --> 01:13:25.967]  And beyond that, I can't tell you.
[01:13:26.007 --> 01:13:29.328]  And so what does that translate out to with the 290 million people?
[01:13:29.348 --> 01:13:30.048]  500 times... Times the 285, 290.
[01:13:30.969 --> 01:13:31.529]  That's correct.
[01:13:35.649 --> 01:13:37.550]  Well, you're talking about multi-millions then?
[01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:38.751]  It's a fair amount.
[01:13:40.491 --> 01:13:43.833]  So what are the local FEMA people more worried about?
[01:13:44.573 --> 01:13:47.855]  SARS naturally occurring or smallpox?
[01:13:48.895 --> 01:13:53.277]  Well, I don't think I can speak or even know what FEMA's position is on this.
[01:13:53.478 --> 01:13:56.379]  Our interface is actually not with FEMA.
[01:13:56.939 --> 01:14:02.522]  Ours is through the Allegheny County and the working group there.
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:06.881]  So we're not directly involved with FEMA nor are we a part of their planning.
[01:14:17.233 --> 01:14:23.956]  I've just read the Feds saying they're going to have secure facilities for this, but you're saying your facility wouldn't be for that?
[01:14:24.477 --> 01:14:36.763]  What I'm asking is will one of these... Yes, it would be for that application in the case of smallpox and that's probably the worst case scenario that we have used for determining what our requirements would be for the system itself.
[01:14:38.083 --> 01:14:41.245]  Is the National Guard training on how to put in your system?
[01:14:41.685 --> 01:14:45.107]  We have had some interface with the National Guard and we would like
[01:14:46.114 --> 01:14:49.657]  to see them have a role in this particular system.
[01:14:50.437 --> 01:14:51.678]  As of now, they do not.
[01:14:52.398 --> 01:14:57.942]  So they may be training for something, but they're not training for the use of our system, nor are they directly interfacing with us.
[01:14:59.063 --> 01:14:59.403]  Wow!
[01:15:00.164 --> 01:15:02.085]  You guys have got a couple different websites.
[01:15:02.345 --> 01:15:08.749]  You're a company that's been involved, here the news says, in a lot of key infrastructure projects around the world.
[01:15:09.570 --> 01:15:12.772]  What site would you recommend for my listeners around the country to visit?
[01:15:13.965 --> 01:15:20.130]  Well, the first site that will be meaningful will actually be the site in Pittsburgh.
[01:15:20.530 --> 01:15:25.354]  We have a very small structure prototype close to us in Newington, Virginia.
[01:15:26.234 --> 01:15:28.936]  And this is the datalistproject.com?
[01:15:29.317 --> 01:15:29.797]  That's correct.
[01:15:29.997 --> 01:15:34.620]  And we have a link to news articles that have links to your website if folks can't spell datalist.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:34.861]  Right.
[01:15:35.381 --> 01:15:38.123]  Doctor, tell us a little bit about yourself in the last 60 seconds.
[01:15:38.143 --> 01:15:40.905]  How did you get involved in this and what's your background?
[01:15:41.045 --> 01:15:42.566]  I'm essentially the developer of this.
[01:15:44.116 --> 01:15:45.537]  I am a planner-developer.
[01:15:45.557 --> 01:15:57.628]  I've been involved on the materials side, and this is, as I said, principally focused upon our desire to participate in the emerging markets of the developing world.
[01:15:58.228 --> 01:16:02.132]  So it was just an odd application, not one that we were really seeking.
[01:16:02.932 --> 01:16:10.659]  But when we saw the opportunity, then we moved on that to define the requirements and then to meet those requirements through this type of facility.
[01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:14.617]  So, now you're just going to demonstrate this to government and the public.
[01:16:15.417 --> 01:16:22.859]  Well, if I was you, Doctor, I would reach out to FEMA, because, I mean, they've got Green Million Man Capacity System.
[01:16:24.019 --> 01:16:29.521]  I mean, I think, if you haven't heard about that, you need to go to InfoWars.com.
[01:16:29.561 --> 01:16:36.163]  Yeah, go to InfoWars.com, absolutely, because our news from last Friday, just click on the archive.
[01:16:36.703 --> 01:16:38.203]  Thanks for joining us, Doctor.
[01:16:38.243 --> 01:16:38.623]  Take care.
[01:16:38.643 --> 01:16:40.844]  Alright, we'll be right back, folks.
[01:16:44.697 --> 01:16:45.217]  It's here.
[01:16:45.497 --> 01:16:46.218]  It's powerful.
[01:16:46.518 --> 01:16:55.102]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[01:16:55.402 --> 01:16:57.243]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[01:16:57.503 --> 01:16:59.564]  No need for expensive, disposable filters.
[01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:04.087]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[01:17:04.367 --> 01:17:10.071]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[01:17:10.271 --> 01:17:12.033]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[01:17:12.213 --> 01:17:15.415]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[01:17:15.635 --> 01:17:17.196]  Get the powerful Berkey now.
[01:17:17.456 --> 01:17:24.001]  Ideal for everyday use, for outdoor sporting events, and in the event of a local or national emergency, you'll be prepared.
[01:17:24.341 --> 01:17:24.722]  Normally $279.

[01:17:28.326 --> 01:17:28.887]  Call toll free.

[01:17:28.987 --> 01:17:29.407]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:17:29.488 --> 01:17:31.790]  Not yet available in California and Iowa.
[01:17:43.021 --> 01:17:48.963]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:17:49.203 --> 01:17:51.444]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[01:17:58.386 --> 01:17:58.987]  I think so.
[01:18:18.541 --> 01:18:19.982]  Hi, Jack Rauner with Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[01:18:45.402 --> 01:18:46.706]  Remember that ad from October of 2000?
[01:18:46.746 --> 01:18:49.674]  The Nasdaq was down 22% for the year?
[01:18:50.075 --> 01:18:51.438]  Well, it's since gone down another 40%.
[01:18:51.519 --> 01:18:53.745]  Folks, where will it bottom out?
[01:18:54.381 --> 01:18:59.744]  Unfortunately for many of us, the paper markets have already wiped out life savings with no hope of recovery.
[01:19:00.124 --> 01:19:01.245]  Don't let this happen to you.
[01:19:01.545 --> 01:19:03.366]  Call Midas Resources today at 800-686-2237.
[01:19:03.426 --> 01:19:07.888]  Gold Spot at that time was trading at about $275.
[01:19:08.649 --> 01:19:11.810]  It is now up dramatically and looking very bullish.
[01:19:12.070 --> 01:19:16.913]  We recommended at that time to put a significant portion of your assets into the gold and silver collector coins.
[01:19:17.193 --> 01:19:18.574]  That advice still stands.
[01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:20.835]  Call Midas today, 800-686-2237.
[01:19:23.155 --> 01:19:25.396]  Collector coins are liquid, private, and portable.
[01:19:25.656 --> 01:19:28.297]  Downside risk is minimal in comparison to paper equities.
[01:19:28.637 --> 01:19:33.579]  The time to move to hard assets is now, before the momentum buyers further escalate the prices.
[01:19:33.819 --> 01:19:35.139]  Protect your financial holdings.
[01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:36.940]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.

[01:20:36.793 --> 01:20:43.538]  Hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Canadians have marched.
[01:20:43.578 --> 01:20:44.239]  They've gone public.
[01:20:44.279 --> 01:20:45.560]  They've marched with their guns.
[01:21:06.235 --> 01:21:16.082]  They've said, you registered our guns and then you confiscated them, and now you're registering even our shotguns and hunting rifles and admitting you want to confiscate them.
[01:21:16.723 --> 01:21:20.446]  No, you can come get my gun out of my cold dead hand!
[01:21:22.327 --> 01:21:27.811]  Now folks, they're registering and banning guns all over this country at the state and local level, and Americans are doing nothing.
[01:21:27.851 --> 01:21:32.154]  So I don't ever want to hear that the Canadians are pathetic jellyfish.
[01:21:32.355 --> 01:21:32.595]  We
[01:21:34.013 --> 01:21:36.894]  We're way down the road when it comes to being jellyfish.
[01:21:37.014 --> 01:21:37.675]  We're pathetic.
[01:21:38.895 --> 01:21:50.180]  I know a lot of us are involved, a lot of us are informed, but ever since Bush got into office and the true assault on guns began, the media told us the assault was over and we bought it.
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:51.600]  A classic enemy tactic.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:52.761]  This is not an assault!
[01:21:53.601 --> 01:21:59.204]  We're gonna pause for, you know, the Chinese New Year, and then here comes the Tet Offensive.
[01:22:01.064 --> 01:22:02.545]  It's basically what's happened here.
[01:22:04.984 --> 01:22:22.131]  So in the next hour I've got Dr. Hudson from one of the big Second Amendment groups or self-defense groups, freedom groups in Canada joining us and almost all the provinces have also rebelled and there's talk of secession if the gun grabbing continues.
[01:22:23.772 --> 01:22:24.552]  This is amazing.
[01:22:25.132 --> 01:22:28.613]  I've got a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet and I've got a bunch of callers.
[01:22:28.633 --> 01:22:29.974]  Let's go to calls right now.
[01:22:29.994 --> 01:22:32.195]  Let me just say about the last guest.
[01:22:33.966 --> 01:22:49.375]  I assessed him rather quickly, a bookworm, a polymer specialist, not a bad guy, a Dudley do-right, and I just wanted you to know what type of camps you're going to be living in.
[01:22:50.596 --> 01:23:00.002]  Just so when you're inside of them, and they drag your wife off to have their way with her, I just want you to know the type of facility you'll be in.
[01:23:00.797 --> 01:23:03.319]  And I'm not saying the facility designer is a bad guy.
[01:23:03.799 --> 01:23:07.582]  It sounds like he's just one of many people pushing for these systems.
[01:23:08.143 --> 01:23:23.734]  I mean, if he doesn't know about the one million man FEMA camps and the bids on that, you know, let's go ahead and talk to John in Georgia, then John in Tennessee, Gary in Kansas, and Elroy in Texas, and others.
[01:23:24.395 --> 01:23:28.378]  Go ahead, John in Georgia, finishing up what you were talking about earlier.
[01:23:28.956 --> 01:23:51.065]  Well, I'm glad to hear some people in Canada seriously talking about secession, but what I was going to say is, in order to defeat the globalists, we have to defend both personal rights and states' rights, and the federal government and the Supreme Court have been all too willing to trample on states' rights these days, and it's good to see someone in a prominent position like Judge Moore taking an open stand, and I encourage the people of Alabama to support him.
[01:23:51.645 --> 01:23:56.387]  And again, he's the judge who says the Bill of Rights is part of jurisprudence,
[01:23:57.404 --> 01:24:07.246]  The Magna Carta of 1214 grew out of the Ten Commandments.
[01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:12.467]  Our Bill of Rights and Constitution grows out of the Magna Carta.
[01:24:13.647 --> 01:24:16.567]  And they're attacking the bedrock of America.
[01:24:17.347 --> 01:24:23.128]  And I want to point out, these Republican friends of mine say, Alex, you used to be a good Republican.
[01:24:23.148 --> 01:24:23.929]  You gave money.
[01:24:23.989 --> 01:24:25.669]  You put up Republican yard signs.
[01:24:26.650 --> 01:24:29.712]  You let us borrow your truck to go around and put the signs up?
[01:24:31.052 --> 01:24:32.013]  What happened to you?
[01:24:32.833 --> 01:24:34.594]  And I say to them, what happened to you?
[01:24:34.714 --> 01:24:36.335]  Bush is signing the assault weapons ban.
[01:24:36.675 --> 01:24:37.756]  Yeah, that is bad.
[01:24:38.196 --> 01:24:39.477]  He's pushing for open borders.
[01:24:39.517 --> 01:24:40.637]  Yeah, that is bad.
[01:24:41.758 --> 01:24:48.861]  His so-called Republican Supreme Court, seven of the nine appointed by Republicans, and look at the rulings!
[01:24:49.922 --> 01:24:50.922]  Look at the rulings!
[01:24:51.062 --> 01:24:51.943]  It's a joke!
[01:24:52.343 --> 01:24:53.884]  What happened to you people?
[01:24:55.601 --> 01:24:57.282]  I didn't change my values.
[01:24:58.523 --> 01:24:59.764]  You changed yours.
[01:24:59.824 --> 01:25:00.964]  What do you say to that, John?
[01:25:01.205 --> 01:25:11.411]  Well, they trampled all over Texas state's right with the recent anti-sodomy rule, and I think to say that someone who's Republican means they're going to defend your rights is putting your head in the sand and turning away from the facts.
[01:25:12.751 --> 01:25:13.112]  It is.
[01:25:14.953 --> 01:25:16.854]  Look, this Supreme Court is a joke.
[01:25:17.651 --> 01:25:20.573]  They said that they can have random checkpoints on the road.
[01:25:21.214 --> 01:25:23.316]  They said you don't have to have Miranda rights.
[01:25:23.376 --> 01:25:25.317]  They said you don't have to have a Fourth Amendment.
[01:25:25.998 --> 01:25:29.440]  They rule that SWAT teams aren't liable for killing innocent people.
[01:25:29.721 --> 01:25:33.043]  They rule you can be arrested for not wearing a seat belt and beat up.
[01:25:35.685 --> 01:25:37.667]  This is our conservative Supreme Court.
[01:25:37.687 --> 01:25:41.410]  It's a sad state of affairs, particularly when they're
[01:25:42.601 --> 01:25:46.423]  Attributing some of their decisions to the European Court of Justice instead of the Constitution.
[01:25:46.503 --> 01:25:47.964]  And that was USA Today!
[01:25:48.064 --> 01:25:49.145]  That was USA Today.
[01:25:49.545 --> 01:26:01.071]  Conservative members, all of them except for Scalia, and he was just a good cop in this fake thing, said, we take our orders from the EU now, we follow their ruling as the authority.
[01:26:01.691 --> 01:26:09.936]  Folks, the EU court doesn't have juries, you can't face your accusers, there's no private property rights, and they're putting it in USA Today!
[01:26:12.910 --> 01:26:13.491]  Great points.
[01:26:13.531 --> 01:26:15.432]  You got me riled up, John.
[01:26:16.873 --> 01:26:20.617]  John in Tennessee, Gary in Kansas, Elroy in Texas and others.
[01:26:21.237 --> 01:26:23.499]  Your calls are up next and a bunch of other news.
[01:26:23.579 --> 01:26:31.426]  I just... This show is like trying to fit the water through a fire hose through one of those straws you stir your coffee with.
[01:26:32.747 --> 01:26:33.668]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.148 --> 01:26:35.750]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.670 --> 01:26:39.353]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.549 --> 01:26:44.210]  I'm taking collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:26:44.290 --> 01:26:46.771]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[01:26:46.951 --> 01:26:47.631]  It feels great.
[01:26:47.811 --> 01:26:48.811]  Absolutely wonderful.
[01:26:48.931 --> 01:26:53.093]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with collagen.
[01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.021]  All right, my friends, let's go back to your calls.
[01:27:18.081 --> 01:27:27.684]  Toll-free number to join us on-air on this live Monday edition, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:27:27.724 --> 01:27:29.285]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee.
[01:27:29.385 --> 01:27:30.205]  John, you're on the air.
[01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:30.665]  Go ahead.
[01:27:31.145 --> 01:27:32.046]  I've got three points.
[01:27:32.126 --> 01:27:36.407]  Bob Hope was mentioned last week on the History Channel, secret passages.
[01:27:36.727 --> 01:27:44.890]  When Bob was in Vietnam doing his comedy shows, the Viet Cong were underneath the stage in their giant multi-story tunnel complex.
[01:27:46.946 --> 01:28:00.750]  So since it was a police action of the United Nations Corporation with the communist Russians on the UN Security Council giving American generals their orders, you know, they probably knew they were there.
[01:28:03.010 --> 01:28:07.612]  A giant meat grinder by design and Bob Hope dead at 100.
[01:28:08.452 --> 01:28:09.452]  I'm sad he's dead.
[01:28:09.732 --> 01:28:10.753]  I've seen some of his movies.
[01:28:10.793 --> 01:28:11.933]  I think he was a funny guy.
[01:28:12.825 --> 01:28:16.747]  But should I have mentioned that he was a big Bohemian Grove member?
[01:28:18.268 --> 01:28:29.273]  Yeah, I gave Arnold's brother-in-law, RFK Jr., a copy of Bohemian Grove and 9-1-1 tapes, so I guess the rest of the Kennedy family now knows what Arnold's up to.
[01:28:31.414 --> 01:28:33.414]  You gave RFK Jr.?
[01:28:33.434 --> 01:28:35.475]  Yeah, he's a law professor.
[01:28:35.515 --> 01:28:40.538]  He was speaking at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, and I asked him a question about
[01:28:42.481 --> 01:28:47.943]  UNESCO taking over the National Parks, and he ridiculed me like Ann Coulter called me a nut.
[01:28:48.343 --> 01:28:49.223]  You know, same thing.
[01:28:49.263 --> 01:28:58.767]  They interrupt you so the transcript's destroyed, and it scares the other members of the audience, but if the rest of the audience speaks out, it doesn't work for them.
[01:28:59.307 --> 01:29:07.770]  But I gave him a copy of both those studies personally after he embarrassed me in front of a group, and he was very interested to get to Bohemian Grove.
[01:29:08.650 --> 01:29:09.431]  Oh, I bet he was.
[01:29:09.471 --> 01:29:10.512]  They all know about that.
[01:29:10.812 --> 01:29:17.357]  Elitist will wait 10, 15 years just to get in on the waiting list.
[01:29:17.998 --> 01:29:19.859]  Arnie got right in about 20 years ago.
[01:29:23.715 --> 01:29:29.098]  When you talk to these people and you talk about the UN taking over the National Parks, did you give him Executive Order 12,986?
[01:29:30.379 --> 01:29:40.125]  I mean, it's even been admitted in the Orlando newspapers and other publications that the UN has taken over our National Parks.
[01:29:40.566 --> 01:29:50.292]  Well, I quoted Henry Lamb's article from WorldNetDaily about that, where he talked about the two million acres under UN control and UNESCO biosphere reserves.
[01:29:51.232 --> 01:29:53.233]  He acted like he didn't know what I was talking about.
[01:29:53.273 --> 01:29:54.413]  I didn't give him a copy.
[01:29:54.473 --> 01:29:56.974]  I kept my copy, which I should have given him my copy.
[01:29:57.535 --> 01:29:59.815]  But I embarrassed him in front of the group.
[01:29:59.835 --> 01:30:01.436]  So maybe he went out and started reading.
[01:30:02.176 --> 01:30:03.537]  Oh, how did you embarrass him?
[01:30:03.877 --> 01:30:05.038]  Well, I didn't.
[01:30:05.078 --> 01:30:13.001]  He was... I was going into the background in local politics as far as the problems we have with the topic.
[01:30:13.041 --> 01:30:14.982]  He was talking about environmental pollution.
[01:30:15.882 --> 01:30:17.963]  And he made me sit down.
[01:30:18.043 --> 01:30:20.804]  So when everybody else got done, I got back up again.
[01:30:21.543 --> 01:30:27.265]  And, you know, it was an embarrassing moment for everybody, but I just went through and I quoted directly from Henry Lamb's article.
[01:30:27.646 --> 01:30:29.766]  I just didn't quit.
[01:30:30.707 --> 01:30:39.030]  Yeah, these so-called intellectuals, you know, he's up there peddling his land-grab system to scam.
[01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:41.891]  They'll try to act elitist and laugh at you.
[01:30:41.931 --> 01:30:43.852]  You've got to laugh at them right back, folks.
[01:30:44.552 --> 01:30:45.673]  Well, I quoted from it.
[01:30:45.713 --> 01:30:46.953]  He didn't answer my question.
[01:30:46.993 --> 01:30:48.674]  He just said Henry Lamb was a nut.
[01:30:49.893 --> 01:30:51.114]  Oh, he goes, oh, that nut.
[01:30:51.254 --> 01:30:52.175]  Yeah, I know who that is.
[01:30:52.535 --> 01:30:53.856]  He didn't answer the question, though.
[01:30:54.956 --> 01:30:56.377]  Which is, they're taxing our lawyers.
[01:30:56.417 --> 01:30:57.958]  Yeah, we're all nuts.
[01:30:58.039 --> 01:30:58.579]  Now, wait a minute.
[01:30:58.679 --> 01:31:03.782]  Five years ago, we were nuts to talk about a new world order when their publications talk about it.
[01:31:03.822 --> 01:31:06.024]  See, that's how they try to neutralize you.
[01:31:06.084 --> 01:31:07.305]  It's just, oh, you're a nut.
[01:31:07.605 --> 01:31:11.448]  Let's not have a discussion about what John is mentioning.
[01:31:11.608 --> 01:31:15.270]  And they interrupt trial lawyers, which Coulter and R. F. K. Jr.
[01:31:15.290 --> 01:31:15.850]  both are.
[01:31:16.291 --> 01:31:19.513]  That's their standard trick, as well as politicians, is to interrupt
[01:31:19.983 --> 01:31:26.151]  When somebody gets to the meat of the problem, the transcript won't show what was really going to be said.
[01:31:26.171 --> 01:31:29.455]  It's a standard trial practice procedure in all courtrooms.
[01:31:35.224 --> 01:31:57.453]  They will hang up on somebody if they get into any meat issue, any real conservative issue, but as long as it's a mindless idiot liberal who's got five brain cells, they'll slap them around for 30 minutes on air and go, see, everything we say is right and accurate because we can slap around an idiot when that idiot is actually in the same camp as they are.
[01:31:57.473 --> 01:32:02.175]  Well, the second point I wanted to make was the GPS car tax and GPS speeding tickets
[01:32:02.822 --> 01:32:28.555]  are in the news and police brag they use it for finding stolen cars so it's not all bad but police and governments run the car theft rackets with their mafia towing and garbage contractors parking tickets and code enforcement tickets for parking are the largest category for vehicle seizures and forfeitures and state police give the mafia tow truckers free title to any vehicle they ask for even when it's listed as stolen and Mayor Giuliani's uncle
[01:32:29.096 --> 01:32:29.777]  Well, yeah, that's all true.
[01:32:56.095 --> 01:33:07.844]  from published mainstream reports will take up the new guy Bloomberg he would tell his employees, this is mainstream news on my website right now, he'd tell women who got pregnant, kill that baby now or you're fired.
[01:33:08.805 --> 01:33:15.430]  Is he part of the Jewish cartel up there, Bloomberg, or is that some other nationality?
[01:33:15.691 --> 01:33:18.173]  No, there's no such thing as a Jewish cartel.
[01:33:18.193 --> 01:33:19.974]  How dare you?
[01:33:19.994 --> 01:33:23.537]  There's only wasp mafia
[01:33:24.452 --> 01:33:26.514]  And, uh, Italian Mafia.
[01:33:27.855 --> 01:33:28.876]  No, hey, hey!
[01:33:29.896 --> 01:33:33.139]  Bugsy Siegel, that was made up.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:35.240]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:35.801]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:33:36.241 --> 01:33:40.164]  And what I'm trying to illustrate here is, I don't think Jews run the world.
[01:33:40.404 --> 01:33:43.827]  I don't think Jews are the secret group behind the New World Order.
[01:33:44.427 --> 01:33:45.948]  Evil people are.
[01:33:46.429 --> 01:33:48.911]  Whether they're Chinese, or German, or Jewish.
[01:33:50.851 --> 01:33:57.414]  If you expose Jewish Mafia, the ADL and people will come out and attack you as anti-semitic.
[01:33:57.434 --> 01:33:58.835]  And I think that's a sick joke.
[01:33:59.315 --> 01:34:00.376]  But it's a great system.
[01:34:03.417 --> 01:34:04.277]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:34:04.438 --> 01:34:09.960]  And yes, I don't know particularly about Bloomberg being Jewish Mafia.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.161]  He's just a big financial guy.
[01:34:13.522 --> 01:34:18.504]  But the stock market... I mean, it doesn't matter whether it's Bloomberg or Giuliani or
[01:34:21.261 --> 01:34:22.381]  Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:34:22.881 --> 01:34:24.822]  These guys are New World Order pimps.
[01:34:25.662 --> 01:34:41.226]  But yes, we should be able to criticize Bloomberg, even though he's Jewish, and we shouldn't let organizations use bad things that have happened to any racial group in the past as an excuse today where we can't criticize them.
[01:34:42.186 --> 01:34:45.887]  I mean, people who criticize black street gangs have been called racist.
[01:34:46.913 --> 01:35:03.678]  Or people that criticize, back during Clinton, when all these communist Chinese spies were paying off people in our government, there were articles in the news, is it covert racism to criticize the Chinese workers at military bases?
[01:35:04.298 --> 01:35:04.698]  No!
[01:35:04.918 --> 01:35:12.240]  China admitted they had thousands of Chinese spies all over our government, destroying our national security,
[01:35:13.052 --> 01:35:16.603]  And Clinton was using them like his own private cash machine!
[01:35:18.227 --> 01:35:19.932]  There were even articles about, uh...
[01:35:21.574 --> 01:35:23.936]  About, uh, Rich and others, you know.
[01:35:24.137 --> 01:35:25.238]  Oh, they're Jewish.
[01:35:25.318 --> 01:35:27.960]  That's why people are criticizing the pardons.
[01:35:28.561 --> 01:35:45.016]  Because they're Jewish, and they're being anti-Semitic, and I've even gotten emails, I'm a Christian, and the Bible says support Israel, and you criticized Israel, and you're going to go to hell because you did that.
[01:35:46.716 --> 01:36:04.349]  So I guess Jesus Christ then is in a lot of trouble, because he criticized the corruption of Israel, and John the Baptist criticized Herod, and David criticized Saul, and it doesn't matter to me, folks.
[01:36:04.469 --> 01:36:08.492]  You get corrupt people in government, and we need to be able to criticize them.
[01:36:10.606 --> 01:36:20.454]  So what you've got is the liberal media lobby has taken over the Christian churches, and they've got this new religion of worshipping Israel.
[01:36:21.214 --> 01:36:22.435]  And it's wrong, folks.
[01:36:22.495 --> 01:36:23.997]  It's out of control.
[01:36:26.759 --> 01:36:32.743]  So whether it's Germany engaged in corruption, or England, or Israel, or the US government, I'm going to expose it.
[01:36:33.004 --> 01:36:39.549]  And that's why I got off on that little sarcastic talk about, hey,
[01:36:40.487 --> 01:36:45.251]  John in Tennessee, don't talk about Jewish Mafia, it doesn't exist.
[01:36:45.371 --> 01:36:46.472]  Of course it exists!
[01:36:46.912 --> 01:36:48.493]  That's how Mafia is formed.
[01:36:48.533 --> 01:36:51.675]  You have Russian racial gangs.
[01:36:52.596 --> 01:36:55.818]  You have Chinese racial gangs.
[01:36:55.838 --> 01:36:58.801]  You have German racial gangs.
[01:36:59.381 --> 01:37:02.203]  You have Irish racial gangs.
[01:37:02.864 --> 01:37:08.508]  And folks, you have Italian, you have Polish, you have Vietnamese,
[01:37:09.966 --> 01:37:31.177]  Out in the West, you have Mexican gangs, you have white supremacist gangs, and you have Jewish organized crime engaged in child porn, porn, ecstasy, cocaine, heroin, all the same trash that others are peddling.
[01:37:32.618 --> 01:37:34.479]  And we will talk about it here.
[01:37:34.659 --> 01:37:34.919]  Yes,
[01:37:35.859 --> 01:37:44.403]  Yes, I know your Bible, your special Bible, given to you by the ADL, says that it's blasphemy to talk like that, but again, I go off the King James, so sorry.
[01:37:45.423 --> 01:37:47.444]  Let's talk to Gary in Kansas.
[01:37:47.524 --> 01:37:48.525]  Gary, you're on the air.
[01:37:48.565 --> 01:37:49.045]  Go ahead.
[01:37:49.305 --> 01:37:50.085]  Hello, Alex.
[01:37:50.125 --> 01:37:51.326]  Something happened to me Friday.
[01:37:51.366 --> 01:37:59.089]  I was able to meet some of your best from Texas, National Guard, and they had a Lone Star on one patch, so that's their call.
[01:37:59.750 --> 01:38:02.391]  But the weird thing is they had that blue patch covered by a pin.
[01:38:03.786 --> 01:38:06.907]  You know, it's that light blue with the stars around it.
[01:38:06.927 --> 01:38:10.409]  I should ask, but when they take off that pin, what was underneath that?
[01:38:10.489 --> 01:38:16.292]  But he did talk to me, one of the captains talked to me for a while about the black helicopters.
[01:38:16.332 --> 01:38:18.452]  He said, yes, we see them from time to time.
[01:38:18.492 --> 01:38:19.393]  They're special ops.
[01:38:20.247 --> 01:38:22.448]  They're quiet, they have all that technology on them.
[01:38:22.508 --> 01:38:26.589]  So, I think they're based out of Houston or so, but they're an artillery unit going up to Leavenworth.
[01:38:26.649 --> 01:38:27.390]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:31.231]  The black helicopters in Texas are based out of Fort Bliss.
[01:38:31.811 --> 01:38:33.472]  Oh, well he said the National Guard has them.
[01:38:33.612 --> 01:38:34.192]  Oh, I thought, okay.
[01:38:34.232 --> 01:38:37.414]  Yeah, but he intercepts, I guess, with those guys a lot.
[01:38:37.754 --> 01:38:40.835]  But I met them at a gun show because they were heading up to Leavenworth.
[01:38:40.895 --> 01:38:45.737]  They were happening to be, their hotel was across from the gun show area, so they decided to come in.
[01:38:46.693 --> 01:38:56.619]  He was in the National Guard for, oh, 11 years, but he talked to me a little bit, but then, you know, after I got into the helicopters, he decided not to divulge too much.
[01:38:57.340 --> 01:39:00.021]  Oh, but again, Ann Coulter says we're crazy.
[01:39:00.041 --> 01:39:06.105]  I have hundreds of mainstream news articles about the Urban Warfare Training, but if we mention it, it doesn't exist.
[01:39:06.545 --> 01:39:07.646]  We're crazy.
[01:39:08.006 --> 01:39:12.309]  You know what the, underneath, they hide that patch, so I should have asked them, but I didn't want to pull it.
[01:39:12.329 --> 01:39:16.131]  They have a pin covering that blue patch, and now we're wearing them on their berets.
[01:39:16.857 --> 01:39:19.618]  There's a light blue with stars and a horseshoe up on top.
[01:39:20.259 --> 01:39:24.160]  They all had these pins covering them like their unit, but it was like, they pulled that off.
[01:39:24.200 --> 01:39:26.201]  I didn't know if that was like a UN patch or what.
[01:39:27.222 --> 01:39:28.842]  You got a lot of that going on.
[01:39:29.042 --> 01:39:33.585]  I don't know particularly, but why were they going up to Leavenworth?
[01:39:33.625 --> 01:39:37.786]  Our teller unit was going to do some practice games or whatever.
[01:39:37.806 --> 01:39:39.987]  He didn't tell me too much of what was going on.
[01:39:40.007 --> 01:39:43.509]  He just said we're heading up to Leavenworth to have a week or two practice.
[01:39:44.488 --> 01:39:52.672]  Well, it's all part of a process of conditioning those men and women that there is no law against them pulling you out of your car, searching your vehicle.
[01:39:53.392 --> 01:39:55.173]  And it's going on all over the country.
[01:39:55.313 --> 01:39:58.494]  Our troops have been training to domestically take our guns.
[01:39:58.995 --> 01:40:02.856]  I have it on video, and I have mainstream news articles admitting it.
[01:40:03.377 --> 01:40:08.299]  And so, for all those out there in denial, your military
[01:40:08.996 --> 01:40:15.358]  That your veterans fought and died to build is being turned into an arm of the New World Order, and it makes me very angry.
[01:40:16.418 --> 01:40:18.819]  Well, thanks for having me on, and we'll call back later.
[01:40:19.059 --> 01:40:20.799]  All right, thanks for your call.
[01:40:20.859 --> 01:40:31.423]  I'll tell you what, I'm going to cover news for the rest of this hour, then I've got another guest coming up for the first 20 minutes of the first hour, where they're refusing to turn their guns in up in Canada, which is great news.
[01:40:31.443 --> 01:40:36.284]  And then we'll take more calls the last 40 minutes of the show.
[01:40:37.051 --> 01:40:57.912]  But you know, I've done an hour and 47 minutes, and I haven't plugged my videos yet, and seeing that that's my number one source of funding, and they're really good videos, very informative, professionally produced, and are one of the key tools in unlocking minds, I'm going to give you the number to get them.
[01:40:59.543 --> 01:41:01.845]  America Destroyed by Design covers the U.N.
[01:41:01.885 --> 01:41:03.386]  takeover of the national parks.
[01:41:03.486 --> 01:41:08.771]  I have park rangers admitting it, the park signs, the executive orders, mainstream news articles.
[01:41:09.532 --> 01:41:12.094]  We have the government carrying out the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:41:13.035 --> 01:41:16.537]  We have the concentration camps and Senate hearings about it.
[01:41:17.518 --> 01:41:22.943]  We have the thumb scanning and the biometric control grid where I get arrested protesting it.
[01:41:23.875 --> 01:41:29.423]  There's that and a lot more in two hours and four minutes in my first film made in 1997.
[01:41:32.066 --> 01:41:35.551]  Then there's my second film, Police State 2000, with the Army and the
[01:41:39.073 --> 01:41:56.598]  Marines and the foreign troops admitting they're training to put you in camps and take your guns, and we have them on tape admitting it, and the documents, and the cashless society control grid, and the federalized checkpoints, and the black helicopters burning police stations, blowing up buildings.
[01:41:57.298 --> 01:42:03.240]  Police chiefs on tape admitting foreign troops and admitting that Delta Force lied to them and tried to bribe them.
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:06.401]  We have the chief of police of San Antonio saying that on tape.
[01:42:07.896 --> 01:42:09.857]  That's about a third of what's in Police State 2000.
[01:42:09.897 --> 01:42:11.278]  You might want to get it.
[01:42:11.318 --> 01:42:12.438]  I made it in 99.
[01:42:13.839 --> 01:42:17.661]  We have the takeover, where the feds hire provocateurs to stop protest.
[01:42:18.602 --> 01:42:21.863]  Where they've built more giant camps, more urban warfare training.
[01:42:22.404 --> 01:42:24.085]  We have people in police stations.
[01:42:24.145 --> 01:42:25.685]  We ask, what are the troops here for?
[01:42:26.106 --> 01:42:28.667]  A woman comes screaming out of the back, martial law!
[01:42:29.067 --> 01:42:31.468]  Light them up and shoot them!
[01:42:31.969 --> 01:42:32.769]  That's on tape.
[01:42:32.829 --> 01:42:36.271]  It's just insane stuff that God has allowed us to catch on tape.
[01:42:36.952 --> 01:42:38.113]  You walk into a police station.
[01:42:38.153 --> 01:42:39.594]  What are the troops about here?
[01:42:40.154 --> 01:42:40.995]  MARTIAL LAW!
[01:42:41.015 --> 01:42:42.736]  We're going to line people up and shoot them!
[01:42:42.756 --> 01:42:43.916]  You got a problem with it?
[01:42:44.897 --> 01:42:50.800]  You know, we just so happen to walk into police stations as women run screaming by us, screaming martial law.
[01:42:51.881 --> 01:42:54.543]  All before 9-1-1, by the way, you see.
[01:42:54.643 --> 01:42:56.084]  Getting them ready covertly.
[01:42:57.324 --> 01:43:02.147]  Then I have 9-1-1, the road to tyranny, after 9-1-1, proving they carried it out.
[01:43:02.628 --> 01:43:04.609]  My best film, my most powerful film.
[01:43:05.262 --> 01:43:14.184]  We have my most bizarre film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, where I snuck into Bohemian Grove with my trusty sidekick Mike Hanson.
[01:43:14.204 --> 01:43:15.164]  You'll want to see that.
[01:43:16.584 --> 01:43:21.145]  We have Masters of Care, and now a great film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:43:21.805 --> 01:43:24.906]  The videos are $25.95 apiece.
[01:43:25.546 --> 01:43:28.727]  I don't know how any of you wouldn't order them.
[01:43:28.887 --> 01:43:32.328]  They're $20 if you order three or more of any of the nine titles.
[01:43:32.368 --> 01:43:33.848]  That's a big fat discount.
[01:43:34.847 --> 01:43:48.337]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, or call toll free to order at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:43:48.357 --> 01:43:57.804]  Again, that number to get my videos, to get them, to make copies, to start waking people up in your area, to force multiply, and educate people about the truth
[01:43:59.658 --> 01:44:04.442]  1-888-253-3139 or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:44:04.723 --> 01:44:08.966]  And it's $4 shipping and handling for one tape, $5 for two tapes, $6 for
[01:44:26.815 --> 01:44:27.936]  We're good to go.
[01:44:48.982 --> 01:44:51.724]  If you haven't, though, take action.
[01:44:51.744 --> 01:44:53.805]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:44:55.146 --> 01:44:57.687]  I'll come back to a five-minute news blitz.
[01:44:57.767 --> 01:45:00.369]  Start the third hour with a guest on your call.
[01:45:00.409 --> 01:45:00.829]  Stay with us.
[01:45:03.556 --> 01:45:04.396]  Federal Reserve.
[01:45:04.456 --> 01:45:06.097]  No more federal than Federal Express.
[01:45:06.177 --> 01:45:07.458]  And they have no reserves.
[01:45:07.678 --> 01:45:10.539]  Our once mighty greenback is losing more value every day.
[01:45:10.659 --> 01:45:13.900]  Your fortune is dwindling and your children's future looks even worse.
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:16.561]  It's all a result of the power-hungry Federal Reserve.
[01:45:16.601 --> 01:45:19.142]  The less wealth you have, the more control they have over you.
[01:45:19.363 --> 01:45:20.503]  But what can you do about it?
[01:45:20.603 --> 01:45:23.424]  We're all reliant on their funny money for our daily transactions.
[01:45:23.624 --> 01:45:24.284]  Well, not anymore.
[01:45:24.404 --> 01:45:28.905]  The Liberty Dollar is a silver-backed currency that competes directly with the Fed's fiat currency.
[01:45:29.045 --> 01:45:31.386]  It's inflation-proof and its value is inherent.
[01:45:31.486 --> 01:45:36.848]  Get it at wishgranted.com or call toll-free 1-800-850-8998.
[01:45:36.968 --> 01:45:39.388]  Now you can escape the greed and control of the Federal Reserve.
[01:45:39.548 --> 01:45:45.150]  Thousands of patriots already have and that means more honorable businesses are accepting the Liberty Dollar every day.
[01:45:45.330 --> 01:45:47.912]  Go to wishgranted.com or call 800-850-8998.
[01:45:49.113 --> 01:45:54.138]  That's 800-850-8998 to get your Liberty Dollars today.
[01:45:54.238 --> 01:46:00.043]  With your help, decent Americans can wipe out the Fed and return to currency with real value, just like the Constitution intended.
[01:46:00.103 --> 01:46:03.486]  Go to wishgranted.com today and free yourself with the Liberty Dollar.
[01:46:03.766 --> 01:46:05.746]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:46:05.826 --> 01:46:16.548]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:46:16.928 --> 01:46:21.449]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:46:21.509 --> 01:46:32.831]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:46:33.431 --> 01:46:40.274]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:46:40.675 --> 01:46:42.816]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:46:43.316 --> 01:46:48.298]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[01:46:48.578 --> 01:46:54.741]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[01:46:55.942 --> 01:47:10.630]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:47:10.990 --> 01:47:12.331]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:47:12.551 --> 01:47:13.731]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:47:14.912 --> 01:47:16.994]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:47:17.274 --> 01:47:22.238]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:47:22.539 --> 01:47:26.602]  The Road of Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:47:26.843 --> 01:47:28.624]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:47:28.704 --> 01:47:33.068]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the Nightmare U.N.
[01:47:33.088 --> 01:47:34.169]  Population Control Program,
[01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.389]  We're good.
[01:48:03.582 --> 01:48:10.109]  You know, I'll say it again.
[01:48:10.169 --> 01:48:12.732]  I started the first hour of the show today.
[01:48:12.752 --> 01:48:15.474]  We're now coming to the end of the second hour.
[01:48:15.494 --> 01:48:17.056]  About to start the third hour.
[01:48:17.817 --> 01:48:24.544]  But I said in the first hour, this weekend, I started looking at the articles just from Thursday and Friday where it was
[01:48:25.974 --> 01:48:31.739]  Microphones are going to be in your cable boxes and in your cars listening to you.
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:33.361]  They're already there in many cases.
[01:48:36.364 --> 01:48:47.794]  The television sets monitor what you watch and report back, and Homeland Security's hooked in, and there's helicopters with the stuff mounted to look for your walls, but it's for your safety.
[01:48:48.395 --> 01:48:50.537]  I mean, folks, this is not a free society!
[01:48:54.594 --> 01:49:03.842]  And it's really started to burn into my brain just how crazy everything's gotten.
[01:49:05.804 --> 01:49:12.749]  We're about to go to Richard in Colorado and others here in a second, but some of the news that I'm going to hit on now and more in the next hour after this guest is off.
[01:49:14.071 --> 01:49:17.914]  Bush faces domestic revolt over Patriot Act sneak searches.
[01:49:18.519 --> 01:49:20.420]  And it says that it's bipartisan.
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:21.920]  Yes, it's finally being reported.
[01:49:22.441 --> 01:49:23.381]  Bipartisan.
[01:49:23.881 --> 01:49:25.822]  Real conservatives leading the charge.
[01:49:26.482 --> 01:49:30.023]  An amazing article that's very honest about RFID chips.
[01:49:30.604 --> 01:49:33.145]  The small tracker chips.
[01:49:36.969 --> 01:49:58.827]  Chips with Everything, it says, and it's out of Channel 4 News out of England, a big national news channel, says that it is hooked in with the government, they do track you, they do photograph you in the stores, they do mesh that number off your digital face scan with the chips when you leave, and that it does track you on the street.
[01:49:59.027 --> 01:50:00.168]  Very, very interesting.
[01:50:00.208 --> 01:50:01.108]  So that's coming up.
[01:50:01.829 --> 01:50:05.412]  And also how they're putting cameras in all the schools and tracking the kids and
[01:50:06.104 --> 01:50:26.278]  An interesting article about Israel where Israel admits that they target small children as a way to knock down the morale of Palestinians and little four year olds will be walking down the street and they'll double tap them in the head with a rifle and I've heard the neocons on the air saying that this is good
[01:50:27.650 --> 01:50:33.375]  And that if you're against killing the children, that you're basically anti-semitic.
[01:50:33.415 --> 01:50:36.999]  But wait, those Palestinians are about as semitic as it gets.
[01:50:38.119 --> 01:50:45.546]  So I think what's happening to the Palestinians is anti-semitic and looks pretty Nazi-like to me.
[01:50:46.226 --> 01:50:50.710]  And it's bad what the Palestinians are doing too, but we're going to talk about that in the next hour as well.
[01:50:51.211 --> 01:50:54.093]  Now let's go ahead right now and talk to Richard in Colorado.
[01:50:54.133 --> 01:50:54.774]  Go ahead, Richard.
[01:50:55.599 --> 01:51:02.202]  Yeah, Alex, I was listening to your show here in Denver on KLMO, and I don't know what happened.
[01:51:02.242 --> 01:51:07.044]  All of a sudden I lost your broadcast for about ten minutes there, and a sports show came on.
[01:51:08.305 --> 01:51:09.745]  I don't know if you know anything about that.
[01:51:10.706 --> 01:51:12.027]  Oh, who knows these days?
[01:51:12.867 --> 01:51:16.489]  Right when you were talking about the President and writing on the flag is when that happened.
[01:51:18.629 --> 01:51:18.990]  Really?
[01:51:19.130 --> 01:51:22.191]  Well, you know, that might have been that our satellite went down.
[01:51:22.231 --> 01:51:23.111]  You know, that happens.
[01:51:23.212 --> 01:51:24.072]  Oh, okay.
[01:51:24.714 --> 01:51:26.615]  And, you know, they might have put something up there.
[01:51:26.955 --> 01:51:28.395]  I mean, does that happen very often?
[01:51:29.776 --> 01:51:30.856]  Not too often.
[01:51:30.936 --> 01:51:33.197]  It's happened before, but it doesn't happen too often.
[01:51:33.777 --> 01:51:35.678]  Now, did you hear my show go off first?
[01:51:36.798 --> 01:51:41.900]  Well, it sounded like somebody hit a switch, like if you're talking on a radio, on a two-way radio.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:42.500]  Yeah.
[01:51:42.520 --> 01:51:44.061]  And it blocks out the frequency.
[01:51:46.036 --> 01:51:52.862]  And then I could hear very faint in the background some kind of, you know, voices talking and I was trying to pick up on what they were saying.
[01:51:52.962 --> 01:51:53.423]  Oh really?
[01:51:53.463 --> 01:51:54.644]  How long did that go on?
[01:51:54.924 --> 01:51:56.245]  For about ten minutes.
[01:51:56.566 --> 01:51:57.046]  Yeah.
[01:51:57.827 --> 01:51:59.508]  Yeah, well, who knows what did that?
[01:51:59.528 --> 01:52:00.929]  No telling.
[01:52:00.949 --> 01:52:02.411]  Anything else on your mind, Richard?
[01:52:02.571 --> 01:52:10.258]  Well, I just wanted to let people know that if they want to have any idea of how bad and how big government's gotten over the years,
[01:52:11.155 --> 01:52:13.017]  There's a real good book out about that.
[01:52:13.057 --> 01:52:17.461]  It's called Lost Right, The Destruction of American Liberty by James Bogard.
[01:52:17.481 --> 01:52:20.464]  He's also the author of The Fair Trade Fraud.
[01:52:20.484 --> 01:52:23.547]  If you read that book, it's a fairly sick book.
[01:52:23.627 --> 01:52:29.592]  It goes into quite a lot of detail about our rights, how they're just being taken away left and right.
[01:52:30.734 --> 01:52:36.239]  And that'll clue some people in that if they think we're conspiracy theorists, it might kind of clue them in as to
[01:52:37.119 --> 01:52:39.241]  This guy backs up everything with footnotes and everything.
[01:52:39.841 --> 01:52:44.364]  Well, government history shows that governments centralize and always do horrible things.
[01:52:44.744 --> 01:52:44.864]  Right.
[01:52:44.924 --> 01:52:51.049]  And people are walking around, you know, denying the law of gravity because they're weak-minded and they don't want to face the facts.
[01:52:51.089 --> 01:52:51.609]  We'll be back.
[01:52:53.730 --> 01:52:55.392]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:55.712 --> 01:53:01.456]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:53:01.696 --> 01:53:04.458]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the...
[01:53:07.535 --> 01:53:10.778]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.247 --> 01:53:19.927]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.568 --> 01:53:21.709]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.330 --> 01:53:23.491]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:23.511 --> 01:53:24.892]  You want answers?
[01:53:24.912 --> 01:53:25.893]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.202 --> 01:53:31.005]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.405 --> 01:53:35.508]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:46.075 --> 01:53:47.396]  Fighting corruption.
[01:53:47.556 --> 01:53:49.478]  Fighting centralization of power.
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:54:05.352]  Talking about basic historical facts and reality to a spoiled, rotten America that's about to have its wake-up call because the globalists are de-industrializing this country and setting it up to be a total slave grid.
[01:54:07.374 --> 01:54:11.597]  Well, north of us, up in Canada, they got big problems as well.
[01:54:11.657 --> 01:54:15.540]  They registered a bunch of guns, then they came out and banned them.
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:26.947]  Now they're trying to register the rest of the guns and the people have gotten wise and they know exactly what that means to the population there in Canada.
[01:54:29.228 --> 01:54:35.913]  And I've read the articles on air where many of the provinces are refusing to register their gun owners.
[01:54:37.414 --> 01:54:39.355]  They say criminals don't follow the law.
[01:54:39.875 --> 01:54:42.297]  Registering law-abiding citizens isn't going to do anything.
[01:54:42.944 --> 01:54:48.248]  Look at New York, look at Chicago, look at England where they ban guns and the crime rates explode!
[01:54:50.209 --> 01:54:58.695]  So these are the type of facts that are out there and then I saw Canadians on TV saying my name is Billy Bob and I'm not turning my guns and you can come take them!
[01:54:59.835 --> 01:55:11.063]  So shame on the general American out there who doesn't have the will and the courage that a Canadian does to say no to this but I guess up there in their media
[01:55:12.321 --> 01:55:17.547]  They're pretty good at just saying, yeah, we're registering and taking your guns.
[01:55:17.607 --> 01:55:20.510]  Down here it's, oh, it's a safety policy.
[01:55:20.971 --> 01:55:22.733]  It's just an instant check.
[01:55:22.813 --> 01:55:26.637]  And all the gun dealers say, it's not a registration because they want to keep selling to you.
[01:55:26.957 --> 01:55:28.219]  Oh, no, it's not a problem.
[01:55:28.259 --> 01:55:28.839]  Go ahead.
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:33.765]  Instead of fighting the system, we just go along with it and rationalize and say,
[01:55:34.807 --> 01:55:41.990]  And say, you know, a duck isn't a duck, and a dog isn't a dog, and a gun registration isn't a gun registration, and they're banning stuff left and right.
[01:55:42.050 --> 01:55:54.075]  Bush wants to sign the new Assault Weapons Bill and ban all semi-automatic shotguns whether they're two-shot or five-shot, and even when the NRA admits it, people are in total denial down here.
[01:55:55.656 --> 01:55:56.876]  So we're going to break here in a second.
[01:55:56.896 --> 01:56:03.839]  We're going to come back with Dr. Ed Hudson, and he's with one of the big groups up in Canada who are
[01:56:05.490 --> 01:56:15.136]  Valiantly fighting the government bureaucrats, the socialistic control freaks up there in the Commonwealth that want to make the Canadian people their property.
[01:56:16.757 --> 01:56:24.982]  And I just hope they keep going and I hope they use this revolution against tyranny up there to remove a lot of the other things we've seen.
[01:56:25.263 --> 01:56:30.446]  There's also big discussions of provinces seceding, secession.
[01:56:31.614 --> 01:56:35.917]  Leaving the Commonwealth if the gun confiscation registration continues.
[01:56:36.857 --> 01:56:37.998]  That's very exciting.
[01:56:38.838 --> 01:56:39.819]  I think that's wonderful.
[01:56:40.219 --> 01:56:52.466]  In fact, I would move to Canada if a state broke away and instated our Bill of Rights, our Constitution, had their own sovereignty, no gun laws, low taxes, I'd move up there.
[01:56:52.526 --> 01:56:57.529]  But right now Canada is a socialist excess pool just like the United States.
[01:56:57.629 --> 01:57:00.471]  So we'll come back and talk to Dr. Ed Hudson.
[01:57:01.670 --> 01:57:10.154]  On the other side of this break, and if you'd like to talk to a Canadian and an organization that's fighting the gun-grabbing, the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:10.174 --> 01:57:11.895]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:11.915 --> 01:57:16.817]  And if you want to link through to some of the Canadian gun groups and self-defense groups,
[01:57:26.224 --> 01:57:37.030]  We have links to their websites in this particular group as well at InfoWars.com, at PrisonPlanet.com, and at InfoWars.net.
[01:57:38.331 --> 01:57:41.033]  So please visit the website.
[01:57:41.053 --> 01:57:41.853]  We're going to break now.
[01:57:42.533 --> 01:57:46.055]  When we get back we will go to Dr. Hudson, who again we're honored to have on the show.
[01:57:46.616 --> 01:57:48.757]  And we will take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:52.501 --> 01:57:55.264]  There is no right more basic than being armed.
[01:57:55.304 --> 01:57:58.087]  A free man owns weapons.
[01:57:59.069 --> 01:58:01.712]  Did a black slave on a plantation own a gun or a knife?
[01:58:02.212 --> 01:58:02.593]  No.
[01:58:03.113 --> 01:58:05.596]  Did a white slave in Rome own a knife?
[01:58:05.896 --> 01:58:06.177]  No.
[01:58:06.317 --> 01:58:06.877]  Or a sword?
[01:58:07.017 --> 01:58:07.298]  No.
[01:58:09.520 --> 01:58:11.322]  In Nazi Germany, could you own a gun?
[01:58:11.342 --> 01:58:11.382]  No.
[01:58:15.623 --> 01:58:19.206]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[01:58:19.466 --> 01:58:20.887]  If so, hope has arrived.
[01:58:21.367 --> 01:58:22.788]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[01:58:23.068 --> 01:58:28.232]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[01:58:28.592 --> 01:58:33.075]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[01:58:33.395 --> 01:58:38.799]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation.
[01:58:39.119 --> 01:58:42.081]  Murr used since biblical times for gum disease and clove oil.
[01:58:42.541 --> 01:58:43.682]  Gum disease is serious.
[01:58:44.162 --> 01:58:47.925]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[01:58:48.185 --> 01:58:54.809]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:59.191]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[01:58:59.611 --> 01:59:01.592]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.

[01:59:03.053 --> 01:59:04.453]  Or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[01:59:16.135 --> 01:59:18.617]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:59:18.677 --> 01:59:19.478]  The New World Order.
[01:59:31.374 --> 01:59:35.597]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:59:35.657 --> 01:59:42.583]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:59:42.723 --> 01:59:44.805]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:59:44.965 --> 01:59:55.213]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:59:55.713 --> 02:00:01.095]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you!
[02:00:01.595 --> 02:00:05.497]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:05.517 --> 02:00:05.957]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:00:05.977 --> 02:00:07.798]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:15.981]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[02:00:16.081 --> 02:00:26.787]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:00:27.167 --> 02:00:31.690]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a white Berkey purification element.
[02:00:31.750 --> 02:00:43.076]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:00:43.676 --> 02:00:50.522]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:00:50.922 --> 02:00:53.064]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:00:53.545 --> 02:00:58.509]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:00:58.809 --> 02:01:04.974]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:01:04.994 --> 02:01:06.095]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:01:06.155 --> 02:01:07.036]  That's toll free.
[02:01:07.056 --> 02:01:07.096]  888-803-4438.
[02:01:07.116 --> 02:01:08.357]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:01:08.377 --> 02:01:10.058]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:34.559 --> 02:01:42.687]  Defending the Bill of Rights of the Constitution, trying to point out that when government grows powerful and large, bad things happen, and it's happening again.
[02:01:43.928 --> 02:01:50.355]  Dr. Ed Hudson is with the Canadian Unregistered Firearm Owners Association.
[02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:57.797]  And again, hundreds of thousands of Canadians have marched, have gone public in all of their provinces.
[02:01:58.518 --> 02:02:06.108]  Many of their provinces, the majority of them are saying, we're not going to register our gun owners, even under the federal orders.
[02:02:06.889 --> 02:02:10.251]  And joining us to tell us about this in more detail is Dr. Hudson.
[02:02:10.791 --> 02:02:15.274]  And Dr. Hudson, of course, is a member of the Canadian Unregistered Farms Owners Association.
[02:02:15.915 --> 02:02:22.639]  Tell us about the group and the historical fight that is taking place up in Canada.
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:24.760]  Yes, sir.
[02:02:24.860 --> 02:02:28.962]  This fight has been going on for 10 years, starting 10 years ago in 1993.
[02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:39.502]  The government introduced to Parliament a law that would require the licensing of all firearms owners and the registration of all firearms in Canada.
[02:02:40.383 --> 02:02:47.584]  The law was protested and demonstrated against by firearms owners as far back as 10 years ago, starting in 1993.
[02:02:48.265 --> 02:02:57.147]  The Canadian government, who had a large majority in Parliament at that time, basically ignored all of the protests, ignored any common sense,
[02:02:57.791 --> 02:03:05.218]  and rammed us through with Parliament as they can do here in Canada because they have a virtual stranglehold on the governing party.
[02:03:06.239 --> 02:03:21.014]  The law was passed in 1995 but they staged it in a very Machiavellian method to come in power slowly over a period of years and we're now down to ten years later in 2003
[02:03:22.748 --> 02:03:32.454]  Where every Canadian who owns a firearm must have a license to own a firearm, and now every firearm in Canada must be registered.
[02:03:33.215 --> 02:03:45.363]  And Dr. Hudson, they make you jump through a bunch of hoops, then after a while, just like New York did, New York City, first you gotta have a license, then they stop issuing the license, but I read an article
[02:03:46.212 --> 02:03:53.915]  Out of Canada last year, it said that over 53% of the guns that had been registered had later been banned.
[02:03:54.175 --> 02:03:57.437]  So registration does lead to confiscation.
[02:03:57.457 --> 02:03:58.137]  Please continue.
[02:03:58.997 --> 02:04:00.578]  That is exactly correct.
[02:04:00.858 --> 02:04:04.839]  The firearms which had been handguns, which had been registered in Canada since 1934,
[02:04:07.401 --> 02:04:08.162]  We're good to go.
[02:04:24.389 --> 02:04:27.070]  They do that in Canada by an order in council.
[02:04:27.110 --> 02:04:29.110]  They no longer even have to go through Parliament.
[02:04:29.190 --> 02:04:37.552]  So anytime they want to, they can declare another classification of firearm banned, and we can no longer own it, we can no longer sell it.
[02:04:39.313 --> 02:04:44.854]  That's amazing, and meanwhile your borders are wide open, record numbers of legals and illegals.
[02:04:45.623 --> 02:04:48.584]  Pouring in, your police are militarizing against you.
[02:04:49.044 --> 02:04:56.546]  I see articles where gun dealers, gun owners, veterans are raided, beat up by your police, have their legal guns stolen.
[02:04:57.166 --> 02:05:00.047]  They just don't want their slaves armed, do they doctor?
[02:05:01.227 --> 02:05:05.349]  The border is open to anything that wants to come across.
[02:05:05.509 --> 02:05:08.610]  There have been those type of home invasions that you mentioned.
[02:05:09.110 --> 02:05:11.210]  The only thing that the Canadian-U.S.
[02:05:11.290 --> 02:05:13.691]  border stops is Canadian beef going south.
[02:05:16.118 --> 02:05:20.341]  That's it, and it turns out that that mad cow probably came from our side.
[02:05:21.382 --> 02:05:29.967]  I've heard that, but the point is on that it's only one cow, and they're making all of this about one cow, but we didn't call this discussion about not mad cows.
[02:05:30.027 --> 02:05:31.388]  No, absolutely.
[02:05:31.428 --> 02:05:35.411]  You just mentioned it, and I'm pointing out how ridiculous all of this is.
[02:05:36.409 --> 02:05:55.160]  Dr. Hudson, tell us about Canadian Unregistered Farms Owners Association because it's coming down to the point now where Canadians across the board are saying, and in fact I've read the articles even in your own mainstream papers, that this is about the government trying to dominate you and that this is about controlling law-abiding citizens.
[02:05:55.460 --> 02:05:57.141]  People are finally getting it.
[02:05:58.297 --> 02:05:59.477]  That's exactly correct.
[02:05:59.597 --> 02:06:09.440]  What we've been saying for 10 years, what gun owners have been saying up here for 10 years, is there's not a criminal anywhere in the world who's registered their firearm or licensed themselves.
[02:06:09.940 --> 02:06:13.361]  This law is not about criminal control or crime control.
[02:06:13.401 --> 02:06:15.521]  It's about controlling its citizens.
[02:06:16.622 --> 02:06:18.142]  Our group is a small group.
[02:06:18.962 --> 02:06:23.343]  You have to understand that membership in our group is completely open.
[02:06:23.363 --> 02:06:25.304]  Our membership list is open to the government.
[02:06:25.544 --> 02:06:26.504]  Anyone who is a member
[02:06:27.114 --> 02:06:35.076]  knows that their name, address, telephone number is going to be completely open to the government if our membership role is confiscated.
[02:06:35.176 --> 02:06:40.356]  So no one joins this group without knowing that they're going to be completely open to the government.
[02:06:40.877 --> 02:06:46.118]  So you guys are signing your John Hancock to your own Declaration of Independence?
[02:06:47.218 --> 02:06:52.619]  It's not actually a Declaration of Independence, but it's specifically a Declaration of Non-Compliance.
[02:06:53.079 --> 02:06:53.779]  We're stating
[02:06:54.426 --> 02:06:57.167]  Very forcefully, peacefully, non-violently.
[02:06:57.648 --> 02:06:59.229]  We will not submit to this law.
[02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:03.491]  Well, it takes a lot of courage.
[02:07:03.951 --> 02:07:06.793]  I know there's been big protests and demonstrations.
[02:07:07.493 --> 02:07:16.678]  How many of the provinces total are telling the feds this law is wrong, unpopular, and we're not going to follow it, this registration law?
[02:07:17.878 --> 02:07:22.721]  Seven out of the ten provinces are doing that, but unfortunately that's only a half step.
[02:07:23.248 --> 02:07:29.572]  The provinces in Canada could take the step and say, we will not allow the law to be enforced in this province.
[02:07:30.113 --> 02:07:35.076]  The Attorney General of each province has that authority, but they won't exercise that authority.
[02:07:35.116 --> 02:07:43.201]  They take the half step and say, we won't spend any of our provincial money doing it, but they will not block the federal government from doing it.
[02:07:43.882 --> 02:07:48.645]  Well, I mean, your Mounties, your federal police are out of control.
[02:07:49.916 --> 02:07:54.578]  And so is our BATF, which is a criminal organization.
[02:07:54.598 --> 02:07:56.438]  I mean, they actually hire crooks there.
[02:07:56.458 --> 02:07:59.800]  But they know what this is all about.
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:03.941]  It seems you guys have really gotten the momentum going.
[02:08:04.341 --> 02:08:06.382]  There's a lot of talk about secession.
[02:08:07.402 --> 02:08:12.044]  If some of these provinces broke off, we could have a new free country, couldn't we?
[02:08:13.519 --> 02:08:15.501]  There's that type of talk in Alberta.
[02:08:15.941 --> 02:08:30.894]  That's a little bit beyond my scope and expertise, but I've certainly been to many, many gun shows in Alberta, and I've certainly stood beside and talked to people in Alberta who are talking about the Alberta Separatist Party, Alberta separating.
[02:08:31.434 --> 02:08:32.555]  I know that that's happening.
[02:08:32.575 --> 02:08:34.657]  I am not a part of that group.
[02:08:34.897 --> 02:08:39.501]  I am focusing on peaceful, non-violent, civil disobedience to a specific
[02:08:40.061 --> 02:08:42.063]  Very unjust law here in Canada.
[02:08:42.203 --> 02:08:47.586]  Now, what type of response are you getting, Dr. Hudson, from the gun-grabbing government?
[02:08:48.667 --> 02:08:52.250]  The response from the government so far is that they've called us frivolous.
[02:08:52.350 --> 02:08:54.091]  They've said that what we're doing is a stunt.
[02:08:54.511 --> 02:08:57.333]  But the main thing they've said, they've said that we're not violent.
[02:08:57.753 --> 02:09:04.198]  Which is our whole point all along, is that gun owners, responsible gun owners, firearms owners, are not violent.
[02:09:04.795 --> 02:09:12.040]  Tomorrow we're on Parliament Hill, our capital here in Ottawa, with a major protest and we're telling them, come arrest us.
[02:09:12.500 --> 02:09:15.682]  We're demanding that our government give us our day in court.
[02:09:15.742 --> 02:09:18.063]  We want to challenge this to the Supreme Court of Canada.
[02:09:18.524 --> 02:09:20.545]  And the government so far has been playing chicken.
[02:09:21.065 --> 02:09:25.349]  They will not come out of the closet and enforce their law.
[02:09:25.529 --> 02:09:28.351]  They don't want to create martyrs, but let me warn you.
[02:09:28.371 --> 02:09:31.874]  I don't know about your Canadian government, but I know what our federal government does.
[02:09:32.475 --> 02:09:46.547]  They will try to infiltrate you with a provocateur who will then get into trouble, who will later have the charges dropped against him, and if you investigate, he's going to be a federal officer, a Mountie, or he's going to be a paid informant.
[02:09:47.107 --> 02:09:49.049]  Are you prepared, doctor, to deal with that?
[02:09:50.228 --> 02:09:58.435]  Fortunately, we've had that type of advice before, specifically from someone who came up from your part of the country to talk to us.
[02:09:58.575 --> 02:09:59.956]  We are aware of that.
[02:10:01.758 --> 02:10:11.145]  I'm not sure exactly how we deal with it, other than we stating as plainly as we can, we're completely peaceful, completely non-violent.
[02:10:11.325 --> 02:10:18.131]  If anyone in our group claims to be operating in our name, does anything that even looks violent, smells violent,
[02:10:18.587 --> 02:10:20.788]  They're not speaking or acting for our group.
[02:10:20.888 --> 02:10:26.411]  Well, what I would do, Doctor, is simply if anything ever happens, if you investigate, it's going to be a fad.
[02:10:26.431 --> 02:10:30.153]  And if they know that you know about that trick, they won't try it on you.
[02:10:31.074 --> 02:10:32.615]  Well, we do know about that trick.
[02:10:32.795 --> 02:10:38.318]  And as I say, fortunately, it was from someone from south of the border that came up and told us about it.
[02:10:38.338 --> 02:10:39.758]  Now, they do that in everything here.
[02:10:39.818 --> 02:10:46.162]  I mean, you're trying to stop them from taking somebody's farm, and a guy shows up and starts threatening the police.
[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:55.826]  And then, if you walk over to their car, it'll have a police badge in it, and then you say, hey, this is a cop, and then the riot police suddenly will disappear.
[02:10:55.846 --> 02:11:00.028]  I mean, it's really sick what they do, trying to destroy our freedoms.
[02:11:00.609 --> 02:11:04.271]  But, I'm reading that a lot of police are actually on your side in Canada.
[02:11:05.445 --> 02:11:08.788]  Most of the rank-and-file police are on our side.
[02:11:09.169 --> 02:11:10.049]  I would say up to 70%.
[02:11:10.510 --> 02:11:19.177]  Again, I don't want to get into a numbers game on something that I can't back up, but certainly the large majority of the rank-and-file police officers support us.
[02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.721]  Well, they know they're safer when you're armed.
[02:11:23.461 --> 02:11:28.506]  They know that places like New York where you can't own a gun, that's where the cops get killed.
[02:11:29.247 --> 02:11:29.667]  Exactly.
[02:11:31.593 --> 02:11:35.755]  Well, it's incredible, so it endangers the citizens, the police, everybody.
[02:11:36.196 --> 02:11:39.577]  The website is CUFOA.CA.
[02:11:39.737 --> 02:11:42.339]  CUFOA.CA.
[02:11:42.359 --> 02:11:44.440]  We've got a link to it on Infowars.com.
[02:11:45.801 --> 02:11:51.404]  Dr. Hudson, the media tries to focus on this in your country and say, oh, it's a money issue.
[02:11:51.444 --> 02:11:53.345]  The people don't like it because it costs money.
[02:11:53.685 --> 02:11:57.707]  But then I talk to the people and it's all about keeping your liberties and freedoms.
[02:11:57.787 --> 02:11:59.248]  Is that a red herring in the media?
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:03.962]  The media likes to talk about that it's safety.
[02:12:04.642 --> 02:12:13.890]  We have a media that is basically controlled by the liberal left wing up here, and they try and talk about that the firearms control issue or the gun issue is a safety issue.
[02:12:14.291 --> 02:12:15.392]  That's the red herring.
[02:12:16.272 --> 02:12:19.755]  What has saved us up here is what Canadians respond to as dollars.
[02:12:21.357 --> 02:12:23.959]  And our federal government has wasted a billion dollars.
[02:12:25.959 --> 02:12:31.003]  Oh, so even gun owners who don't care about guns, they're mad about the big bureaucracy.
[02:12:31.783 --> 02:12:32.244]  Exactly.
[02:12:32.764 --> 02:12:41.591]  But the issue here, and this is the issue that I would like to make plain to your readership south of the border, the issue is rights and freedom.
[02:12:41.751 --> 02:12:42.772]  The issue is liberty.
[02:12:43.604 --> 02:12:52.646]  The government, in passing this law, passed seven specific violations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is roughly equivalent to the U.S.
[02:12:52.706 --> 02:12:53.246]  Bill of Rights.
[02:12:53.586 --> 02:12:57.087]  Dr. Hudson, I tell you what, do six or seven more minutes with us.
[02:12:57.707 --> 02:13:01.068]  We got a break, and we're going to go to break right now.
[02:13:01.088 --> 02:13:07.330]  We'll be right back in just a few minutes, and I want you to elaborate on that and hopefully give us some tips.
[02:13:07.410 --> 02:13:11.391]  We could use some tips from you about standing up and not being cowardly.
[02:13:12.231 --> 02:13:12.951]  We'll be right back.
[02:13:16.235 --> 02:13:20.738]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:13:21.079 --> 02:13:25.182]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:13:25.482 --> 02:13:26.022]  We listened.
[02:13:26.322 --> 02:13:31.306]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:13:31.586 --> 02:13:32.067]  We listened.
[02:13:32.467 --> 02:13:35.489]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:13:35.929 --> 02:13:36.450]  We listened.
[02:13:36.930 --> 02:13:40.833]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:13:41.353 --> 02:13:41.833]  We listened.
[02:13:42.174 --> 02:13:47.416]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:13:47.836 --> 02:13:49.197]  Again, we listened.
[02:13:49.557 --> 02:13:56.941]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[02:16:13.829 --> 02:16:17.171]  If you're like most Americans, you've heard how low interest rates are these days.
[02:16:17.251 --> 02:16:19.353]  So why are you still struggling to pay off debt?
[02:16:19.673 --> 02:16:22.195]  Rates on debt consolidation loans are at all-time lows.

[02:17:21.193 --> 02:17:26.476]  Alright, it's our final segment for Dr. Edward Hudson.
[02:17:27.016 --> 02:17:30.417]  He's with Canadian Unregistered Farms Owners Association.
[02:17:31.238 --> 02:17:37.041]  Seven of the ten provinces are saying they're not going to be part of this gun registration confiscation scheme.
[02:17:39.362 --> 02:17:45.504]  And now the momentum, I would say, is on the side of gun owners there in Canada.
[02:17:45.645 --> 02:17:48.506]  We're about to go to Fellas in Missouri and Trevor in Texas.
[02:17:49.350 --> 02:18:01.237]  And others who want to talk to our guests, but anything else you'd like to add about this subject of liberty and freedom and what your despotic government is trying to do there in Canada, Dr. Hudson?
[02:18:02.417 --> 02:18:10.401]  I would like to take the opportunity to say to your listeners that as you said in your introduction, the people of the United States need to wake up.
[02:18:10.762 --> 02:18:16.965]  The forces that are in play here in Canada that want to take over our rights and freedoms,
[02:18:17.381 --> 02:18:19.743]  I'm not talking about an international conspiracy.
[02:18:19.783 --> 02:18:27.328]  I'm just talking about left-leaning type of people who want to trample on our rights, who want to take our freedom away from us.
[02:18:27.788 --> 02:18:34.793]  Before they do that, they know that they have to get us licensed, they know they have to register our firearms, and then they know they have to disarm us.
[02:18:35.373 --> 02:18:38.996]  Then they can, as you would probably say, hurt us into the slave pen.
[02:18:39.596 --> 02:18:44.500]  That's happened in Australia, that's happened in England, and now it's happening to the north of you here in Canada.
[02:18:45.740 --> 02:18:46.561]  And I really think
[02:18:47.048 --> 02:18:56.430]  That we in Canada sleptwalk through the first part of this, and I'm really afraid that the same thing is happening down in the States, down in the United States.
[02:18:57.390 --> 02:19:03.511]  I know that you are aware of it, but not enough people in your leadership.
[02:19:03.631 --> 02:19:08.492]  Gun owners aren't aware of it because Republicans are the ones pushing it.
[02:19:08.972 --> 02:19:15.874]  Democrats always tried to push it, but Republicans push it, and these neocons go, well, I guess it's alright then.
[02:19:17.538 --> 02:19:20.961]  I guess I'll turn Granddaddy's shotgun in if Bush wants me to.
[02:19:22.683 --> 02:19:32.632]  I really invite them to come up here in Canada and see what's happening here because they're requiring... I have to have a license now to own a firearm.
[02:19:32.772 --> 02:19:33.973]  I do not have a license.
[02:19:34.213 --> 02:19:35.034]  I own firearms.
[02:19:35.094 --> 02:19:36.015]  I do not have a license.
[02:19:36.497 --> 02:19:38.619]  I own 50 rifles, shotguns and pistols.
[02:19:38.979 --> 02:19:40.260]  Not a one of them is registered.
[02:19:40.441 --> 02:19:44.844]  I have invited the police into my home to say, arrest me, confiscate it if you want to.
[02:19:45.225 --> 02:19:49.809]  They have not come in because they know I'll win this fight on a constitutional challenge.
[02:19:49.829 --> 02:19:52.491]  They violate my Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
[02:19:52.911 --> 02:19:56.312]  But the point that I'm trying to make is to pass this law.
[02:19:56.532 --> 02:20:05.615]  Our government saw fit to trample the Canadian Bill of Rights and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, just to trample our rights in the mud to get this passed.
[02:20:05.875 --> 02:20:07.296]  Yeah, it shows they're tyrants.
[02:20:08.356 --> 02:20:16.339]  Too many Americans think that they can depend on the Second Amendment for their rights, but when the government turns against you,
[02:20:17.334 --> 02:20:23.018]  That Second Amendment right is going to go down the drain, just like our Charter of Rights and Freedoms and our Canadian Civil Rights.
[02:20:23.038 --> 02:20:25.659]  Hey, the courts are already ruling we don't have this right.
[02:20:25.919 --> 02:20:27.360]  Let's talk to Phyllis in Missouri.
[02:20:27.380 --> 02:20:28.381]  You're absolutely right, Doctor.
[02:20:28.601 --> 02:20:29.261]  Phyllis, go ahead.
[02:20:29.301 --> 02:20:30.562]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:20:31.143 --> 02:20:31.543]  Oh, hi.
[02:20:31.943 --> 02:20:39.067]  I was just wondering, do your people know that the powers really want to reduce our population by 80 percent?
[02:20:39.107 --> 02:20:39.988]  Do they have any idea?
[02:20:41.761 --> 02:20:46.442]  He's talking about the leftist UN plan, the world population reduction and all this.
[02:20:46.462 --> 02:20:47.223]  Were you aware of that?
[02:20:48.683 --> 02:20:49.203]  No, I'm not.
[02:20:49.523 --> 02:20:58.166]  I must say I've had my nose stuck so deeply in the firearms issue that I'm actually somewhat woefully ignorant of some of the other things going on around me now.
[02:20:58.686 --> 02:20:59.626]  Anything else, Phyllis?
[02:21:00.846 --> 02:21:06.268]  No, I just think if all of this is going on, it's pointing to us being eliminated.
[02:21:06.937 --> 02:21:08.979]  Well, that's what JPFO says.
[02:21:09.459 --> 02:21:11.201]  Jews for the Preservation of Firearms.
[02:21:11.281 --> 02:21:11.802]  Ownership.
[02:21:12.662 --> 02:21:13.523]  Registration.
[02:21:13.623 --> 02:21:14.564]  Confiscation.
[02:21:14.664 --> 02:21:15.565]  Extermination.
[02:21:16.026 --> 02:21:19.649]  And certainly, if you're disarmed, the government can get away with doing that.
[02:21:20.149 --> 02:21:22.892]  Now, will this end up being like Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany?
[02:21:23.393 --> 02:21:24.734]  I don't want to give them that chance.
[02:21:25.616 --> 02:21:27.377]  Let's talk to Trevor in Texas.
[02:21:27.418 --> 02:21:30.800]  Trevor, you're on the air with our guest from Canada, Dr. Hudson.
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:31.200]  Go ahead.
[02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:31.881]  Okay.
[02:21:31.941 --> 02:21:34.523]  First of all, I'd just like to say thanks for taking my call, Dr. Hudson.
[02:21:34.543 --> 02:21:35.904]  I appreciate all your work.
[02:21:35.944 --> 02:21:38.385]  Everyone out here has got all y'all in our prayers.
[02:21:38.846 --> 02:21:46.091]  I want to say something because, like you said earlier, Alex, this is all like trying to fit a fire hose water through a coffee straw.
[02:21:46.818 --> 02:21:47.239]  We're good to go.
[02:21:59.233 --> 02:22:10.820]  Well, the Amber Alert System is an admitted FEMA takeover arm of communications and they just said, oh, it's for the kids.
[02:22:10.860 --> 02:22:13.421]  I tell you what, Trevor, I'll put you on hold.
[02:22:13.681 --> 02:22:15.162]  We're about to let the doctor go.
[02:22:15.262 --> 02:22:17.344]  I'll come back to you and others in the next segment, okay?
[02:22:18.244 --> 02:22:19.125]  Okay, I'll put you on hold.
[02:22:19.705 --> 02:22:22.607]  Dr. Hudson, I really appreciate you coming on the show today, sir.
[02:22:23.422 --> 02:22:25.703]  Well, I certainly appreciate the opportunity.
[02:22:25.723 --> 02:22:37.307]  I have been concerned about what's happening down in the States, as again, I'm extremely glad to know that there's a program like you that are warning Americans to wake up before it's too late.
[02:22:37.807 --> 02:22:39.308]  We have a problem here in Canada.
[02:22:39.608 --> 02:22:40.728]  We're going to take care of it.
[02:22:40.788 --> 02:22:42.269]  Tomorrow we have a demonstration.
[02:22:42.649 --> 02:22:50.212]  We're challenging our government directly, peacefully, non-violent, but it's a challenge to our government and we demand to be heard.
[02:22:52.268 --> 02:22:53.029]  Absolutely.
[02:22:53.089 --> 02:22:54.930]  Well, Dr. Hudson, God bless you.
[02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:56.151]  Godspeed and take care.
[02:22:56.872 --> 02:22:57.332]  Thank you, sir.
[02:22:57.612 --> 02:22:57.973]  You bet.
[02:22:58.033 --> 02:23:00.034]  We'll be back with more calls and more news.
[02:23:00.074 --> 02:23:00.795]  Stay there, Trevor.
[02:23:00.835 --> 02:23:02.156]  I'll get back to you when we get back.
[02:23:02.176 --> 02:23:03.317]  Stay with us.
[02:23:05.859 --> 02:23:06.759]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.260 --> 02:23:08.861]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.782 --> 02:23:12.464]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.552 --> 02:23:18.993]  What if you could actually save money on everything you ever needed to buy?
[02:23:19.434 --> 02:23:24.996]  Sounds unbelievable, but you can at www.homeshopgroup.com.

[02:23:39.955 --> 02:23:42.456]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:23:42.976 --> 02:23:45.736]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:46.117 --> 02:23:49.657]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:23:50.137 --> 02:23:54.158]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:23:54.178 --> 02:23:58.179]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring.
[02:23:58.199 --> 02:24:01.300]  I want to play that Elvis song, looks like an angel.
[02:24:01.320 --> 02:24:07.102]  Talks like an angel, walks like an angel, but I got wise.
[02:24:07.242 --> 02:24:08.702]  She's a devil in disguise.
[02:24:09.474 --> 02:24:11.755]  Because that's exactly what this whole government is.
[02:24:12.995 --> 02:24:14.135]  And I go back to history.
[02:24:14.695 --> 02:24:22.197]  History shows that governments centralize power and go absolutely ape and control and slaughter a bunch of people.
[02:24:22.737 --> 02:24:23.977]  That's the norm.
[02:24:24.297 --> 02:24:26.518]  Freedom has been the exception.
[02:24:27.298 --> 02:24:33.279]  And you got all these yuppies and good ol' boys and liberals and hippies and just all of you.
[02:24:33.759 --> 02:24:34.920]  You need to wake up.
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:36.640]  This is serious business.
[02:24:37.828 --> 02:24:42.492]  The exact same pattern is being woven with an overlay of high-tech.
[02:24:44.354 --> 02:24:49.439]  Trevor in Texas, you were talking about government propaganda and manipulation.
[02:24:49.699 --> 02:24:52.121]  Please continue, then we'll go to John and others.
[02:24:52.622 --> 02:24:53.062]  Absolutely.
[02:24:53.082 --> 02:25:01.350]  The name of your website says it best, and I think that's one of the most important issues when fighting the New World Order is this brainwashing that we're getting from the American media and the media abroad.
[02:25:01.949 --> 02:25:08.111]  The Amber Alert System, it occurred to me when I first started to see those stories on TV that they were following that story so closely.
[02:25:08.171 --> 02:25:13.712]  It's like there's no way they could have been on the scene and following it so tightly unless they knew what was going to happen.
[02:25:14.152 --> 02:25:17.813]  But yet, when you see the same thing overseas, it's like, oh, we don't know what happened.
[02:25:18.114 --> 02:25:18.694]  We weren't there.
[02:25:18.734 --> 02:25:19.734]  We didn't get to cover that.
[02:25:20.054 --> 02:25:24.855]  You know, but all the details were all there when they started to introduce the Amber Alert System.
[02:25:25.155 --> 02:25:30.357]  Well, this is what we're going to use now because this poor little girl, and God bless her, you know, whatever happened.
[02:25:30.877 --> 02:25:31.438]  I'm sorry.
[02:25:31.558 --> 02:25:56.456]  And it just so happened that that same year the FCC law was passed that all radio and TV stations had the EAS FEMA takeover boxes remote control federal boxes put into them and the federal plan said it's EAS and they said for PR we're going to call it Amber and make it mandatory for the little kids.
[02:25:56.736 --> 02:26:04.239]  Yeah, they're totally playing off of our good nature, you know, the general, I think, general good nature of the ignorance, you know, and the ignorance of citizens.
[02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:13.364]  You know, they want to introduce this and go, look... Yeah, that's what empowered Hitler was good Germans that thought, man, I mean, people say, how did the Germans do it?
[02:26:13.604 --> 02:26:14.304]  How did they do it?
[02:26:14.644 --> 02:26:16.365]  Well, because they were saps!
[02:26:16.805 --> 02:26:21.327]  I wish they could have gotten to the people who perpetrated 9-11 as fast as they did to the Malvo people.
[02:26:22.067 --> 02:26:25.389]  All those guys who shot up, you know, as quickly as they got to them.
[02:26:26.101 --> 02:26:29.762]  Well, bottom line, they're not going to put themselves in jail.
[02:26:29.782 --> 02:26:30.502]  Of course.
[02:26:30.822 --> 02:26:40.806]  But going back to Hitler, the Germans were conservative, upright, good family values, a lot less decadent than we are today, folks.
[02:26:41.666 --> 02:26:48.628]  And a corrupt individual, an intelligent individual, an evil individual got control of the media
[02:26:49.495 --> 02:26:56.257]  And Germans, to this day, they think Hitler was right because the news said so.
[02:26:57.237 --> 02:27:04.199]  The media could tell the average American today that a Hitler character is good and they'd buy it, which they have done.
[02:27:04.799 --> 02:27:09.661]  Yeah, well, you know, like you said earlier, you've talked to some of the foreigners, even some of the foreigners who come here.
[02:27:10.081 --> 02:27:17.963]  I know for a fact when I was volunteering with Mike out at the stand and I talked to Helga, I don't know if you know Helga, she went into great detail about her experience as a young
[02:27:18.530 --> 02:27:24.817]  As a very young girl in Germany when America came through and razed their city completely with fire.
[02:27:25.378 --> 02:27:31.524]  Talking about people walking through the streets on fire and diseased children on every corner.
[02:27:31.965 --> 02:27:36.009]  And she said that she has no desire to see war again and that this is exactly how it began.
[02:27:36.289 --> 02:27:39.333]  When they started putting on the black masks and saying it was for your own good.
[02:27:39.924 --> 02:27:41.004]  You can't see who I am.
[02:27:41.044 --> 02:27:44.505]  I'm supposed to be able to do whatever I want to you, but you, you know, but it's for you.
[02:27:44.525 --> 02:27:48.567]  Because I'm protecting you, and how dare you say you've got rights?
[02:27:48.787 --> 02:27:49.487]  I'm sick of it.
[02:27:49.607 --> 02:27:50.807]  I'm so sick of these pagans.
[02:27:51.008 --> 02:27:52.748]  They're ruining, they're destroying everything.
[02:27:53.268 --> 02:27:54.589]  You know, and they don't, they don't care.
[02:27:54.969 --> 02:27:55.909]  That's the bottom line.
[02:27:55.929 --> 02:27:58.330]  Well, the same pattern is being woven again.
[02:27:58.350 --> 02:27:59.150]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:59.250 --> 02:27:59.690]  Thank you, sir.
[02:27:59.710 --> 02:28:02.131]  Yeah, that's the point I made in the first hour.
[02:28:03.111 --> 02:28:07.493]  I've talked to people from Poland and Russia about the
[02:28:10.229 --> 02:28:33.355]  Secret police walking up and grabbing on their mother when they were 10 and the father shoves the secret police officer and you never see daddy again and then mommy refuses to go out with him so a couple months later she gets shipped off I mean that's what they do folks
[02:28:34.645 --> 02:28:36.846]  Because the system can't disappoint its own.
[02:28:37.346 --> 02:28:45.948]  Stalin took all the criminals out of the jails because they were the only people that put black ski masks on and bust down doors and break up families and beat people up.
[02:28:48.369 --> 02:28:50.289]  And so they're going to have a little fun with you.
[02:28:50.449 --> 02:28:54.411]  You're going to have criminals, you already do, in uniforms, running your life.
[02:28:56.091 --> 02:28:57.491]  Just like Nazi Germany.
[02:28:57.992 --> 02:28:58.932]  Just like Russia.
[02:28:59.472 --> 02:29:03.093]  And the only thing holding them back from going hog wild
[02:29:04.056 --> 02:29:07.058]  Is that there's still a lot of good police and a lot of good military.
[02:29:08.158 --> 02:29:12.101]  But, again, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:29:12.141 --> 02:29:18.545]  The average cop goes home and he watches the dramas, the sitcoms, where the good cop tortures people.
[02:29:18.805 --> 02:29:22.107]  Where the good cop lies and steals because it's for a better cause.
[02:29:22.747 --> 02:29:26.329]  And that good cop's having his mind twisted and molded.
[02:29:27.890 --> 02:29:29.251]  And when his partner gets killed,
[02:29:30.899 --> 02:29:34.941]  The feds come in and say, the answer is, you weren't hard enough.
[02:29:35.021 --> 02:29:39.183]  You didn't follow the policies correctly.
[02:29:40.604 --> 02:29:47.808]  And all the heat the police are under in this bad situation is then focused into making them even more police state thuggish.
[02:29:48.588 --> 02:29:52.810]  Then when they get in trouble for being thugs, the feds come in and say, you're in trouble.
[02:29:53.110 --> 02:29:54.611]  We're federalizing your city.
[02:29:54.991 --> 02:29:57.993]  And then they intensify the training to make them thugs.
[02:30:00.151 --> 02:30:06.858]  It doesn't matter if it's Republicans or Democrats running things, it's the same policies, just different rhetoric on the nightly news.
[02:30:09.221 --> 02:30:21.154]  And so that's why they're on the news saying torture's good, world government's good, troops on the streets are good, the end of liberty is good, giving up liberty gives you security, which is a total lie.
[02:30:24.326 --> 02:30:36.517]  And so they're trying to train the cops that all of this is normal and you've got to do this to get your paycheck and you've got to do this to defend the homeland or the economy's going to go down.
[02:30:38.279 --> 02:30:43.984]  And so the middle class, the soccer moms, are listening to talk radio where they say that
[02:30:44.614 --> 02:30:46.915]  The neocons say sweatshops are good.
[02:30:46.935 --> 02:30:48.555]  That's good in third world.
[02:30:48.855 --> 02:30:50.316]  They're lucky they have sweatshops.
[02:30:50.876 --> 02:30:52.896]  Genetically modified food is good.
[02:30:53.736 --> 02:30:55.337]  Some gun control is good.
[02:30:55.857 --> 02:30:57.397]  Open borders is good.
[02:30:58.878 --> 02:31:02.699]  Bush blocking Dan Burton's committee on Pardongate's okay.
[02:31:04.779 --> 02:31:06.920]  But really they don't even discuss all those issues.
[02:31:06.980 --> 02:31:07.320]  It's all
[02:31:08.144 --> 02:31:15.467]  You can turn your car on and listen to talk radio, this is what I listen to when I'm out driving around, and it's how dumb Hillary Clinton is.
[02:31:16.287 --> 02:31:20.929]  I can come back two hours later, turn the car on, it's how dumb Hillary Clinton is.
[02:31:21.609 --> 02:31:26.571]  I can drive to the store, get out, come back ten minutes later, it's how dumb Hillary Clinton is.
[02:31:28.412 --> 02:31:29.852]  That's all they do, folks.
[02:31:31.253 --> 02:31:32.133]  That's all they do.
[02:31:32.853 --> 02:31:34.254]  It's this mindless diversion.
[02:31:35.183 --> 02:31:40.805]  It's good cop, bad cop, two different sides of the New World Order having a mindless political distraction.
[02:31:43.386 --> 02:31:58.171]  And all their pimps and all their pops, their William Bennett, Mr. Million Dollar a Day gambling habit, and Ann Coulter, Miss Government Minion, just all of them.
[02:31:59.662 --> 02:32:02.643]  Then you got the useful idiots like Charlie Daniels.
[02:32:03.323 --> 02:32:04.503]  I like Charlie Daniels.
[02:32:04.563 --> 02:32:06.164]  I like Charlie Daniels' music.
[02:32:07.624 --> 02:32:13.045]  But, uh, Charlie Daniels is... If you don't like what the President's doing, you ought to leave!
[02:32:13.825 --> 02:32:16.846]  Don't you put down my flag!
[02:32:17.406 --> 02:32:21.207]  Well, sir, your flag is a symbol of my free speech.
[02:32:22.807 --> 02:32:23.888]  Okay, Mr. Daniels?
[02:32:24.368 --> 02:32:25.468]  Ain't no rag.
[02:32:25.528 --> 02:32:28.229]  Well, it's being treated worse than a rag, Mr. Daniels.
[02:32:31.115 --> 02:32:37.237]  But see, it's a well-meaning person like Daniels that's going to send this country straight into the pit.
[02:32:39.877 --> 02:32:44.219]  I mean, I guarantee you, you talk to Daniels, you tell him, I've heard him on the air, we got him coming on the show.
[02:32:45.919 --> 02:32:49.360]  You talk to Daniels and you tell him, well, Bush is signing the assault weapons ban.
[02:32:49.380 --> 02:32:51.581]  Well, I don't want to talk about it.
[02:32:52.421 --> 02:32:54.642]  Well, he shouldn't, but I still support him.
[02:32:54.682 --> 02:32:56.542]  What are you, some kind of liberal?
[02:32:58.523 --> 02:32:59.803]  I don't know, we'll see what happens.
[02:33:03.015 --> 02:33:04.696]  George Bush went down to Georgia.
[02:33:04.736 --> 02:33:06.377]  He was looking for a soul to steal.
[02:33:06.397 --> 02:33:07.278]  He was in a bind.
[02:33:07.298 --> 02:33:08.259]  He was way behind.
[02:33:08.279 --> 02:33:09.920]  He was willing to make a deal.
[02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:12.802]  That's right.
[02:33:12.882 --> 02:33:15.343]  And they've got some new country song.
[02:33:15.363 --> 02:33:16.604]  It isn't by Daniels.
[02:33:17.625 --> 02:33:22.548]  But it's about, we got a lot of gang members and a lot of troublemakers and terrorists.
[02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:24.440]  Put them in the camps!
[02:33:24.580 --> 02:33:25.701]  Blow their heads off!
[02:33:25.741 --> 02:33:27.221]  We're cowboys!
[02:33:27.341 --> 02:33:28.721]  Give us whiskey!
[02:33:29.281 --> 02:33:31.122]  And beer for horses!
[02:33:31.342 --> 02:33:33.082]  Put everybody in camps!
[02:33:33.542 --> 02:33:35.103]  We're for America!
[02:33:35.183 --> 02:33:37.263]  Kill everybody!
[02:33:37.863 --> 02:33:39.144]  Kill the criminals!
[02:33:39.644 --> 02:33:40.664]  Hang them high!
[02:33:40.744 --> 02:33:42.384]  Tie them up in the swamps!
[02:33:42.604 --> 02:33:42.924]  Death!
[02:33:42.984 --> 02:33:43.285]  Death!
[02:33:43.365 --> 02:33:43.685]  Death!
[02:33:43.905 --> 02:33:44.245]  Camps!
[02:33:44.305 --> 02:33:44.625]  Camps!
[02:33:44.665 --> 02:33:45.025]  Camps!
[02:33:45.525 --> 02:33:49.672]  I mean, it's like this rap country song I hear every time I turn the radio on.
[02:33:49.692 --> 02:33:51.075]  I don't even know who the group is.
[02:33:51.195 --> 02:33:53.178]  I wrote it down but left it in my truck.
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:55.322]  Maybe you've heard it.
[02:33:55.762 --> 02:33:59.528]  I'll take some whiskey for my men and beer for my horses.
[02:34:00.385 --> 02:34:12.168]  They mix crime in with terrorism and talk about the police just need to kill more people, fill them full of lead, hang them, put them in camps, and bring whiskey for my men and beer for my horses.
[02:34:12.669 --> 02:34:15.509]  I mean, the propaganda, folks, is everywhere.
[02:34:17.250 --> 02:34:20.471]  I turn on country music and it's talking about camps?
[02:34:22.291 --> 02:34:25.292]  I open up the newspaper and it's how wonderful the FEMA camps are?
[02:34:25.952 --> 02:34:28.073]  John in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:34:28.718 --> 02:34:31.479]  Alex, thank you so much for talking to me today.
[02:34:31.499 --> 02:34:34.681]  I just want to tell you it's the first time I've ever called into your program, obviously.
[02:34:35.281 --> 02:34:48.688]  I want to thank you for what you're doing, but I want to talk about something that happened on your show about a week ago and how it ties into the doctor's presentation this afternoon, which was wonderful and highly motivational for those of us who are out there that are entering the fight.
[02:34:50.049 --> 02:34:56.692]  The doctor said that his mailing list was completely open and that everybody who participated in his organization was open to government.
[02:34:57.626 --> 02:35:05.468]  And that they were all willing to stand up and voice their distaste, or whatever's going on in their particular province.
[02:35:05.508 --> 02:35:17.830]  Yeah, and there's no point that his database should be open, because that, under the Magna Carta, which they have in Canada, he has his right to privacy, and the government is the force that doesn't have the right to privacy.
[02:35:18.751 --> 02:35:24.252]  I appreciate that, but I also, last week or so, and you might remember the show, you may not,
[02:35:25.086 --> 02:35:28.769]  There were two people who called in in succession, where they both gave their last names.
[02:35:29.369 --> 02:35:32.172]  And at that very moment, Alex, I have to tell you that I was excited.
[02:35:32.712 --> 02:35:33.693]  I was actually happy.
[02:35:33.773 --> 02:35:37.576]  I had listened to you for several years on what would be considered a pirate thing.
[02:35:37.596 --> 02:35:41.299]  We're getting ready to try and make moves for retransmitters so we can get these, you know,
[02:35:42.014 --> 02:35:44.055]  I was very happy that people were finally standing up.
[02:36:01.203 --> 02:36:02.103]  That's really what we need.
[02:36:02.123 --> 02:36:03.104]  This is what we need.
[02:36:03.144 --> 02:36:06.765]  We need people to say, my name is Alex Jones and I'm not going to take it anymore.
[02:36:06.885 --> 02:36:08.926]  Let me just explain why I can't allow that.
[02:36:09.547 --> 02:36:12.708]  I understand and that's really what I wanted to talk to you about.
[02:36:12.868 --> 02:36:13.428]  Hold on a second.
[02:36:13.708 --> 02:36:19.071]  They need to form their own organizations, their own websites, their own radio shows, their own access shows.
[02:36:19.691 --> 02:36:20.692]  Form and come together.
[02:36:20.772 --> 02:36:21.572]  Here's the problem.
[02:36:22.592 --> 02:36:24.673]  This has actually been done quite a bit on radio.
[02:36:24.713 --> 02:36:26.134]  People have lost lawsuits over this.
[02:36:27.159 --> 02:36:30.041]  Someone will call in and pose as someone else.
[02:36:30.601 --> 02:36:33.903]  The host will buy it, let them say it, and then be held liable.
[02:36:34.424 --> 02:36:39.567]  That's why I don't let people say their last names, because I don't know if that's their last name.
[02:36:39.587 --> 02:36:39.947]  Go ahead.
[02:36:40.087 --> 02:36:40.467]  I got you.
[02:36:40.547 --> 02:36:43.749]  And at that very moment of being so excited, I heard your response.
[02:36:43.809 --> 02:36:45.911]  I'm thinking to myself, why?
[02:36:46.911 --> 02:36:48.452]  Your message is getting out there.
[02:36:48.612 --> 02:36:52.955]  And the things that you have done, your videos and those types of things, are making a difference.
[02:36:53.155 --> 02:36:56.257]  And what it is going to require is somebody to take your word.
[02:36:56.658 --> 02:36:57.079]  And never stop!
[02:37:18.297 --> 02:37:19.758]  Let me tell you how I got involved.
[02:37:20.178 --> 02:37:22.460]  I got involved with what was going on in the world.
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:40.192]  I woke up from my real life due to the fact of the transformation of our educational system here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, this movement towards school work, the workforce and investment boards, and where we identify that not only is it a local agenda, it's a Commonwealth agenda, it's a federal agenda, and by God, it's a UNESCO agenda as well.
[02:37:40.853 --> 02:37:42.414]  They're creating a planned economy.
[02:37:43.332 --> 02:37:47.754]  Which turns out that my representatives in government are not performing my function.
[02:37:47.774 --> 02:37:50.576]  They're actually performing the function of some other agenda.
[02:37:50.676 --> 02:37:52.397]  That's what got us involved in the fight.
[02:37:52.417 --> 02:37:54.818]  Hold on, John, because you're making a lot of good points.
[02:37:54.958 --> 02:38:04.002]  They're trying actively, in their own documents, to overthrow your children's thinking process to make you pliable, willing slaves.
[02:38:04.262 --> 02:38:06.683]  That's their own Department of Education policy.
[02:38:07.023 --> 02:38:10.045]  But that is the point, and the point is that that co-work
[02:38:10.465 --> 02:38:13.186]  It's the covert nature of how it's being implemented.
[02:38:14.207 --> 02:38:17.329]  The tone of the last 20 minutes of the show was, are we talking about Duke?
[02:38:17.489 --> 02:38:20.050]  Are the cops, are good cops bad cops?
[02:38:20.070 --> 02:38:26.373]  They've been told that, you know, our founding fathers, I just watched your video, our founding fathers were terrorists.
[02:38:26.513 --> 02:38:30.435]  Those folks who wear the badges that believe that are Duke.
[02:38:30.495 --> 02:38:31.776]  You have a hard time, at any rate.
[02:38:32.536 --> 02:38:33.677]  My point is, is that
[02:38:34.286 --> 02:38:37.407]  We stand up, on a local level, and fight this school move.
[02:38:37.728 --> 02:38:39.388]  You know, it's a radical transformation.
[02:38:39.408 --> 02:38:41.749]  We had to build a brand new middle school.
[02:38:41.789 --> 02:38:42.870]  We transformed the middle school.
[02:38:43.270 --> 02:38:44.350]  Cost us millions of dollars.
[02:38:44.430 --> 02:38:47.172]  Largest tax increase in local history in the last 30 years.
[02:38:48.592 --> 02:38:58.937]  We identify, as we keep digging, digging, digging, we find that it, you know, not only, again, a common, a local, commonwealth, federal agenda, it's now this international agenda, and that's how we get involved in the fight.
[02:38:59.257 --> 02:39:01.558]  The point is, is that, in order to fight it,
[02:39:03.021 --> 02:39:09.024]  We have to, everybody has to stand up and say, my name is John Farley and I'm from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and I'll reclaim Pennsylvania.
[02:39:09.264 --> 02:39:10.845]  I will reclaim Pennsylvania.
[02:39:12.546 --> 02:39:15.868]  And we have to stand on the steps of the courthouse and fight.
[02:39:15.948 --> 02:39:17.869]  And I just, I wanted to call you and tell you that.
[02:39:18.409 --> 02:39:20.470]  It just tied into what the doctor was saying.
[02:39:20.890 --> 02:39:22.491]  And again, I wanted to discuss with you about that.
[02:39:22.531 --> 02:39:25.913]  I understand the libel thing, but everybody needs to stand up.
[02:39:26.113 --> 02:39:26.853]  No, I understand.
[02:39:28.803 --> 02:39:38.646]  John in Pennsylvania, it's actually empowering to step over the line, to step out in the light, to get out there on the battlefield, just like in Braveheart.
[02:39:39.326 --> 02:39:56.191]  And, you know, let's get it on, let's do it, let's fight the globalists, because we know they're evil, we know they're scum, we know they operate off of keeping people in the dark, and it's time to bring out the light, it's time to expose these creatures, it's time to make them run back under the rocks,
[02:39:57.109 --> 02:40:17.567]  And once you realize how evil the globalists are, and just how wicked they are, and you read their own policy, where they talk about how they're going to dumb you down, and break up your family, and put your kids on drugs, and take your farms and ranches, when you know that it's their stated plan, and they're so arrogant they think you'll never read their own documents,
[02:40:18.127 --> 02:40:28.035]  That we post on my website, then you know, and there's no fear, there isn't a question, we have got to fight this thing, because we are on the side of good, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:40:28.055 --> 02:40:28.975]  Thanks for the call, John.
[02:40:28.995 --> 02:40:29.996]  That's exactly right, Alex.
[02:40:30.016 --> 02:40:30.617]  Thank you very much.
[02:40:30.637 --> 02:40:35.160]  I appreciate the call, and it was exciting hearing you and the action you're taking.
[02:40:35.220 --> 02:40:36.421]  I really do appreciate that.
[02:40:37.882 --> 02:40:46.489]  And, you know, it is like trying to force the amount of information that you have in a water hose, a fire hose, under pressure.
[02:40:47.685 --> 02:40:50.246]  Thousands of gallons every few minutes.
[02:40:51.026 --> 02:40:54.927]  It's like trying to force that through the straw you stir your coffee with.
[02:40:55.747 --> 02:40:57.628]  I could take one of these articles.
[02:40:59.568 --> 02:41:00.649]  Dr. David Kelly.
[02:41:01.309 --> 02:41:07.530]  I've probably read a hundred stories on it, read his emails, listened to the accounts of his family, obviously murdered.
[02:41:09.331 --> 02:41:12.852]  I could talk for hours about Condoleezza Rice caught in new lies.
[02:41:13.983 --> 02:41:17.705]  I could spend hours about how the agenda between Hillary and Bush is identical.
[02:41:18.586 --> 02:41:21.388]  I could spend hours about the control grid, the police state.
[02:41:22.869 --> 02:41:29.253]  I could spend hours about this new 9-1-1 report and the omission of the Saudi Arabia stuff.
[02:41:31.174 --> 02:41:34.416]  It's just they're a pack of murdering criminals, bottom line.
[02:41:36.770 --> 02:41:41.116]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:41.296 --> 02:41:45.722]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.882 --> 02:41:50.268]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:41:50.308 --> 02:41:51.629]  The New World Order.
[02:41:52.110 --> 02:41:53.811]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:07.301 --> 02:42:17.565]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:17.765 --> 02:42:23.148]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:42:23.648 --> 02:42:27.049]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:42:27.069 --> 02:42:27.409]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:27.429 --> 02:42:28.690]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:42:37.569 --> 02:42:42.052]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:42:42.412 --> 02:42:46.494]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:42:46.794 --> 02:42:47.335]  We listened.
[02:42:47.635 --> 02:42:52.618]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:42:52.898 --> 02:42:53.398]  We listened.
[02:42:53.779 --> 02:42:56.820]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:42:57.241 --> 02:42:57.781]  We listened.
[02:42:58.241 --> 02:43:01.303]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:43:01.623 --> 02:43:01.983]  We're good.
[02:43:28.326 --> 02:43:36.728]  Do you want the news?
[02:43:36.988 --> 02:43:38.168]  I mean the real news.
[02:43:38.488 --> 02:43:39.948]  Because you're sure not getting it now.
[02:43:40.348 --> 02:43:43.469]  If you'll open your ears, we'll open your eyes, and we'll open your mind.
[02:43:43.789 --> 02:43:47.590]  What did the government know about the possibility of terrorist attacks prior to 9-11?
[02:43:47.930 --> 02:43:51.510]  Is mainstream media telling you everything you should know about the war on terror?
[02:43:51.910 --> 02:43:54.751]  What is our real interest in Iraq and Saddam Hussein?
[02:43:55.171 --> 02:43:58.833]  Who stands to gain if we give up our freedoms in the name of national security?
[02:43:59.193 --> 02:44:02.295]  Who's behind the manipulation of our financial markets, and why?
[02:44:02.615 --> 02:44:03.256]  We're the jury.
[02:44:03.476 --> 02:44:04.256]  You be the judge.
[02:44:04.456 --> 02:44:06.017]  We're the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:06.358 --> 02:44:08.799]  Are you tired of being lied to by mainstream media?
[02:44:09.019 --> 02:44:11.280]  Well, so are we, and we're doing something about it.
[02:44:11.580 --> 02:44:15.263]  Visit us at GCNLive.com and discover the truth for yourself.
[02:44:15.543 --> 02:44:16.463]  We're the real deal.

[02:44:23.607 --> 02:44:26.608]  www.gcnlive.com.
[02:44:26.768 --> 02:44:28.389]  We're the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:28.469 --> 02:44:29.350]  Check us out today.
[02:44:29.870 --> 02:44:31.831]  We promise not to tell anyone you are here.
[02:44:38.333 --> 02:44:43.475]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:44.156 --> 02:44:46.497]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:44:48.698 --> 02:44:51.679]  Alright folks, I'm sorry I can't take any more calls today.
[02:44:51.700 --> 02:44:53.320]  We're out of time.
[02:44:53.360 --> 02:44:55.581]  I'll meet you in a couple of final news stories.
[02:44:57.082 --> 02:45:06.387]  And I do suggest you all visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net to see the stuff we didn't cover, but Blair Orders Blunket
[02:45:07.481 --> 02:45:09.722]  To put identity card scheme on hold.
[02:45:09.843 --> 02:45:14.445]  Now, they've already put it in via the driver's license and the youth cards.
[02:45:14.506 --> 02:45:21.850]  The kids all have to have ID cards to leave their houses, but they've been trying for four years to make everybody have one to buy and sell.
[02:45:21.890 --> 02:45:26.373]  They're trying to make shopkeepers make you thumb scan to buy and sell.
[02:45:26.933 --> 02:45:32.017]  Arlington, Texas is trying to make all retailers make you thumb scan, even if you pay cash.
[02:45:32.437 --> 02:45:34.598]  They're doing this outside Denver.
[02:45:34.698 --> 02:45:35.619]  It's everywhere, but
[02:45:36.957 --> 02:45:44.200]  The good news is the people are refusing and so it's backfiring on them for now.
[02:45:44.300 --> 02:45:46.781]  So this just shows that we can take action and say no.
[02:45:48.221 --> 02:45:58.045]  Tony Blair has put off the launch of a plan to compel every Briton to hold an ID card in response to fears that it will turn into an expensive and frustrating assault on liberty.
[02:45:59.845 --> 02:46:00.485]  Here's another one.
[02:46:00.505 --> 02:46:01.786]  This is out of the age.
[02:46:01.926 --> 02:46:04.147]  This is the family of the
[02:46:05.371 --> 02:46:12.054]  military man who actually killed the Iraqis in the ambush on Lynch's convoy.
[02:46:12.074 --> 02:46:14.294]  He was the guy that fought to the death.
[02:46:14.835 --> 02:46:22.417]  Turns out, in the government's own admission now, everyone else basically cowered in fear, flopping around begging someone to save them.
[02:46:22.437 --> 02:46:24.458]  I mean, it was a maintenance crew, folks.
[02:46:25.259 --> 02:46:26.259]  But this one gentleman
[02:46:29.531 --> 02:46:35.595]  This one gentleman, he actually was the one who died and got stabbed and tortured and killed, and he's the guy that fought.
[02:46:36.075 --> 02:46:38.176]  But Lynch, she got the credit for all of it.
[02:46:39.117 --> 02:46:44.640]  When she was the one cowering and begging, and when she was under the covers, when the Delta Force came in begging for mommy.
[02:46:45.340 --> 02:46:52.524]  And fine, folks, but my point is, again, they didn't want to have the dead body of the real veteran that did the heroic stuff.
[02:46:52.784 --> 02:46:56.306]  They'll just make up a lie, steal his honor, and give it to her.
[02:46:56.446 --> 02:46:57.767]  And I know that's patriotism.
[02:46:58.247 --> 02:47:00.928]  I'm not patriotic because I think of dead veterans.
[02:47:01.128 --> 02:47:02.408]  I understand, okay?
[02:47:02.628 --> 02:47:04.408]  I know how you work, neocons.
[02:47:04.688 --> 02:47:05.909]  I understand.
[02:47:06.189 --> 02:47:08.709]  I'm against turning my guns in, so I'm a liberal.
[02:47:08.829 --> 02:47:09.769]  I understand you.
[02:47:10.850 --> 02:47:14.250]  I'm against having wide open borders and everybody losing their job to the illegals.
[02:47:15.151 --> 02:47:16.311]  So, I'm a liberal.
[02:47:16.391 --> 02:47:18.011]  I understand how it works, okay?
[02:47:18.371 --> 02:47:19.291]  You pieces of trash.
[02:47:20.952 --> 02:47:26.273]  So, dead ambush hero, ignored as Jessica Lynch is worshipped, and uh...
[02:47:27.782 --> 02:47:31.385]  Niger hits back over uranium claim and says it was all lies.
[02:47:32.065 --> 02:47:33.126]  That's all documented.
[02:47:33.146 --> 02:47:36.328]  It just goes on and on, folks.
[02:47:36.348 --> 02:47:37.429]  There's so much more.
[02:47:38.650 --> 02:47:39.710]  Five more U.S.
[02:47:39.750 --> 02:47:41.612]  troops died this weekend, tragically.
[02:47:41.652 --> 02:47:43.433]  It says the morale's at all-time lows.
[02:47:43.493 --> 02:47:48.556]  I didn't get to the part about Israel admittedly targeting children to be shot in the West Bank.
[02:47:50.618 --> 02:47:53.520]  That's terrible, but again, both sides are just murdering each other.
[02:47:56.301 --> 02:48:03.686]  There's another article, reveal the secret cabal which spun for Blair and the British police they now found out are part of some secret society.
[02:48:04.167 --> 02:48:05.268]  I'm out of time, folks.
[02:48:06.909 --> 02:48:13.694]  But before I end this hour, you heard the caller, the last caller, John in Pennsylvania, talk about Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:14.514 --> 02:48:17.997]  Three minutes of that two hour plus film is FEMA saying,
[02:48:18.627 --> 02:48:19.728]  Christians are terrorists.
[02:48:19.788 --> 02:48:21.930]  George Washington and Thomas Jefferson are terrorists.
[02:48:22.410 --> 02:48:23.991]  And they're enemies of the federal government.
[02:48:24.171 --> 02:48:24.492]  Okay?
[02:48:24.972 --> 02:48:27.754]  Every three-minute piece is that hardcore in this video.
[02:48:29.075 --> 02:48:30.616]  Get road to tyranny, folks.
[02:48:30.756 --> 02:48:31.897]  What are you waiting for?
[02:48:32.478 --> 02:48:33.358]  Show it to people.
