[00:00:03.897 --> 00:00:06.659]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:14.423 --> 00:00:15.084]  Big Brother.
[00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:16.785]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:18.606]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:20.067]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.847 --> 00:00:21.748]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:21.768 --> 00:00:26.150]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:28.932]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:00:29.841 --> 00:00:30.701]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:37.944]  Alright my friends, it's already Wednesday the 3rd of December 2003.
[00:00:38.124 --> 00:00:44.066]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we're going to be
[00:00:58.832 --> 00:01:02.495]  Live here for the next three hours in the third hour of the show.
[00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:08.401]  I have one of the widows of the 9-11 victims coming on the show.
[00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:16.588]  And she's a lady who wrote the letter to Bush saying that she thinks that he was basically behind 9-11 and stood to gain from it.
[00:01:16.608 --> 00:01:21.972]  We also have her lawyer coming on the show, Elaine Marinari.
[00:01:22.193 --> 00:01:24.695]  And of course, we're going to have her lawyer, Philip
[00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:26.088]  All right.
[00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:46.926]  You have any comments?
[00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:50.768]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:50.788 --> 00:01:51.268]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:51.308 --> 00:01:53.569]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:56.490]  The websites are InfoWars.com, just updated, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.810]  So that's InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:17.044]  Again, coming up in the third hour, 9-11 in the Neverland.
[00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:21.047]  Press ignores Widow's Bush treason lawsuit.
[00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:24.809]  We'll be getting into that and the lawsuit itself.
[00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:29.233]  Interesting 9-11 development.
[00:02:29.773 --> 00:02:34.256]  Dean Bush may have been tipped to 9-11 attacks.
[00:02:34.476 --> 00:02:41.702]  Now, again, by having a Cynthia McKinney or by focusing on Cynthia McKinney's comments about 9-11, the media made it partisan.
[00:02:42.805 --> 00:02:46.607]  All ignoring Stanley Hilton, who's a Republican, and others that have been exposing it.
[00:02:47.127 --> 00:02:54.151]  And then they try to shift out of the thinking process into a left-right, mindless, tribal fight.
[00:02:54.992 --> 00:02:56.853]  And that's what Newsmax is doing here.
[00:02:57.073 --> 00:02:59.454]  Dean Bush may have been tipped to 9-11 attacks.
[00:03:02.987 --> 00:03:15.242]  Newsmax, and it says, it looks like ex-congressional nutball Cynthia McKinney has picked up some news support from her conspiracy theory that President Bush had advanced word of the 9-11 attacks.
[00:03:15.282 --> 00:03:21.370]  Well, it's admitted he had advanced word from none other than Democratic presidential frontrunner Howard Dean.
[00:03:22.173 --> 00:03:29.198]  Dean said on Monday that President Bush is withholding documents related to 9-11 because they may show he knew what was coming.
[00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.640]  Well, that's admitted, too.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.783]  The most interesting theory is that I've heard so far, which is nothing more than a theory.
[00:03:35.303 --> 00:03:36.504]  That's what Dean had to say.
[00:03:36.604 --> 00:03:37.645]  He's shelling for them.
[00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:39.706]  It can't be proven.
[00:03:39.867 --> 00:03:44.951]  It's that he was warned ahead of time by the Saudis, Dean told a caller to Washington, D.C.'
[00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.394]  's Diane Rehm Show, according to a transcript obtained by Opinion Journal.
[00:03:50.476 --> 00:03:52.557]  Now, who knows what the real situation is?
[00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:54.719]  Presidential conspiracy theorist cautioned.
[00:03:55.219 --> 00:04:05.966]  He then added, but this trouble is, by suppressing that kind of information, you lead to those kinds of theories, whether they have a truth to them or not.
[00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.851]  Wow, isn't that interesting?
[00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:13.493]  I mean, I've made two films, written a book, published a book about 9-11.
[00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:15.155]  We have hundreds of articles posted.
[00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:16.916]  We know they had prior knowledge.
[00:04:16.956 --> 00:04:21.579]  We know the White House blocked the FBI from investigating al-Qaeda or arresting bin Laden.
[00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.360]  Clinton did it.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:23.140]  Bush did it.
[00:04:23.641 --> 00:04:25.762]  Bush signed W199I.
[00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:28.264]  They told public officials not to fly.
[00:04:28.404 --> 00:04:30.786]  We know he got the briefing by the CIA.
[00:04:30.846 --> 00:04:36.430]  We know the Egyptians, the Israelis, the Saudis, the Germans, the British, the French.
[00:04:37.461 --> 00:04:43.204]  The FBI, FBI agent Robert Wright, and countless others, David Shippers, all warned them.
[00:04:44.704 --> 00:04:45.585]  All told them.
[00:04:47.565 --> 00:04:48.226]  This was coming.
[00:04:48.366 --> 00:04:53.388]  I mean, I got on air two months before and said they're going to use Bin Laden to attack New York as their Patsy.
[00:04:53.868 --> 00:04:55.069]  I mean, how did I know that?
[00:04:55.489 --> 00:04:56.389]  Everybody knew.
[00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.491]  But again, they make it an issue of Cynthia McKinney and Howard Dean.
[00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:05.013]  So we'll go over that and a bunch of other news I haven't even talked about yet.
[00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:07.410]  Believe me, you want to stay with us.
[00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:08.091]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:14.177]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:14.377 --> 00:05:18.782]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:18.942 --> 00:05:23.326]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:23.366 --> 00:05:24.708]  The New World Order.
[00:05:25.628 --> 00:05:27.269]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:50.542]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:50.822 --> 00:05:56.184]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:12.530]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.531]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[00:06:14.711 --> 00:06:20.353]  Cheaperhotels.com, SaveOnYourRentalCar.com, HalfPriceAirlineTickets.com.

[00:07:08.382 --> 00:07:11.865]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:15.628]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:07:15.728 --> 00:07:19.671]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:07:19.891 --> 00:07:26.056]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:07:26.476 --> 00:07:34.382]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:07:34.782 --> 00:07:40.125]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.

[00:08:09.724 --> 00:08:14.770]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:15.151 --> 00:08:17.434]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:34.912 --> 00:08:40.294]  Hello, folks!
[00:08:41.635 --> 00:08:42.975]  Again, it is Wednesday.
[00:08:43.996 --> 00:08:49.638]  Now into the second segment for many of our stations that carry news the first five minutes, the first segment of the global transmission.
[00:08:51.713 --> 00:08:53.415]  Boy, there is, again, a lot of news.
[00:08:53.455 --> 00:08:56.357]  We have several very important guests coming on the show today.
[00:08:56.397 --> 00:09:06.766]  Paul Watson next hour, third hour, the lawyer for one of the widows of 9-11 and the widow herself, where she's charging Bush treason in 9-11.
[00:09:06.806 --> 00:09:12.651]  And a lot of the victims, the widowers, the widows, are saying this from the evidence that's available to everyone.
[00:09:13.191 --> 00:09:15.994]  Meanwhile, the phony conservative media
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.326]  Uh, is trying to spin things that, oh, it's a leftist lie.
[00:09:22.426 --> 00:09:25.469]  Why, even Howard Dean has questions now.
[00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:27.070]  But see, it's the Democrats.
[00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:29.633]  Now the Democrats are involved in 9-11 as well.
[00:09:31.448 --> 00:09:33.910]  Also coming up from the London Guardian, U.S.
[00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:36.132]  fires Guantanamo defense team.
[00:09:36.732 --> 00:09:46.300]  Even the military lawyers that the government appointed in the kangaroo show trials they're setting up said, hey, we're not going to have a show trial here.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.504]  We want to really, you know, at least defend the people that you're trying at Guantanamo.
[00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:53.465]  And they said, no, you're fired.
[00:09:53.526 --> 00:09:55.027]  So that's quite a trial where the
[00:09:55.874 --> 00:10:05.056]  Where the defense team doesn't do what the prosecution and the judge wants, which is already, again, a show trial by every definition of kangaroo court.
[00:10:05.456 --> 00:10:07.197]  And so they just say, you're fired.
[00:10:07.237 --> 00:10:08.097]  They already fired.
[00:10:08.437 --> 00:10:10.517]  Well, he said he resigned, and they said, no, you're fired.
[00:10:11.057 --> 00:10:17.359]  General Rick Baucus last year, the head general of Guantanamo, brigadier general, he refused to torture.
[00:10:18.404 --> 00:10:24.767]  The people there at the base said it was wrong, said most of them were innocent, and so he was kicked out.
[00:10:24.947 --> 00:10:27.008]  So, just another development, we'll get into that.
[00:10:27.849 --> 00:10:33.731]  Also, Justices to Weigh releasing Vince Foster death photos after 10 years.
[00:10:34.812 --> 00:10:40.054]  Economy destroying Kyoto Protocol on global warming dies from lack of support.
[00:10:40.654 --> 00:10:41.815]  We'll get into that.
[00:10:41.835 --> 00:10:44.496]  I wouldn't say it's dead, but it definitely is in trouble.
[00:10:44.556 --> 00:10:45.357]  That's good news.
[00:10:46.889 --> 00:10:51.431]  Cops connect 12 shootings along Ohio Highway.
[00:10:52.332 --> 00:10:57.374]  Again, cops connect 12 shootings along Ohio Highway.
[00:10:58.807 --> 00:11:03.170]  And they are saying they think it might be sniper attacks.
[00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:08.013]  Mugabe envisions alternative world order headed by China.
[00:11:08.573 --> 00:11:10.434]  Again, this is what I've been telling you about for years.
[00:11:10.794 --> 00:11:18.219]  They know that you know there's a world government now, so they're going to control the world by saying they're competing visions of a world order.
[00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:23.122]  It's like the Republican and Democratic Party here, or the Tories and Labor in England.
[00:11:23.562 --> 00:11:38.473]  It's all the same agenda, the same actions, different rhetoric, the illusion of choice to bypass discussion of policies here at home that hurt us, or in England, or in Europe, or globally, this is how they do it.
[00:11:38.513 --> 00:11:41.916]  Their tried and trusted system of confusion.
[00:11:42.572 --> 00:11:52.855]  So, now the current world order is unjust and unsustainable and needs an alternative headed by Communist China, according to Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe.
[00:11:52.875 --> 00:11:59.856]  Of course, China and Russia and Putin, before he left, Zhang Zemin, have all been saying this the last few years.
[00:12:00.016 --> 00:12:03.857]  And the UN says this, and so does the big think tanks here.
[00:12:04.277 --> 00:12:07.218]  It's totally and completely staged.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:24.692]  But again, this will bypass a debate of we don't want world government to the left is saying we want a communist or a socialist UN, EU run world government that's against the Iraq war and is loving and wants to give money to the poor and have global taxes to help the poor.
[00:12:25.432 --> 00:12:36.120]  And then all the leftists go running after that and then they get on the air on the neocon shows and go, we've got to fight the new world order by getting behind Bush and getting behind our own global system to fight it.
[00:12:37.094 --> 00:12:41.397]  And they've got you all caught in their snares, so we'll get into that as well.
[00:12:42.538 --> 00:12:48.001]  Chinese military ready for necessary casualties over Taiwan.
[00:12:49.082 --> 00:12:51.643]  China threatening war there from AFP.
[00:12:52.584 --> 00:12:56.366]  People hearing persistent mysterious hum aren't alone.
[00:12:56.426 --> 00:12:58.087]  The New York Times.
[00:12:59.208 --> 00:13:04.932]  Now in my film, Road to Tyranny, I have the news articles, I have the weapons from law enforcement catalogs.
[00:13:06.039 --> 00:13:16.082]  And now they have top scientists saying something is going on in western countries and it looks like some type of ultra-low frequency weapon system.
[00:13:17.282 --> 00:13:23.944]  Well, I mean, they've got ultra-low frequency and ultra-high frequency weapons sold for a couple hundred dollars in law enforcement catalogs.
[00:13:24.384 --> 00:13:25.305]  Again, that's in the film.
[00:13:25.965 --> 00:13:33.847]  Shomertech, one of the biggest, if not the biggest, arguably the biggest, law enforcement catalog in the Americas,
[00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:48.615]  They sell the sonic nausea machine, the supersonic nausea machine, and they say, oh, police have used these at quite a few political rallies to make the speakers vomit and to make the crowds get sick and leave.
[00:13:48.915 --> 00:13:52.576]  If you want to neutralize demonstrations, this is a wonderful tool.
[00:13:54.377 --> 00:13:56.398]  That was over two years ago, by the way.
[00:13:56.418 --> 00:13:59.439]  We first learned of the weapons being sold.
[00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:27.092]  And we know they have Humvees mounted with microwave guns, with sonic weapons, the Boston Globe a few months ago, and there's a hyperlink to it in my article, DARPA Engineering the Beast System, in our News and Focus section, you can find it, and then a link through to the Boston Globe article about, well, DARPA does not just want to use cell towers as control systems for all the cameras and the face scanners and the microphones around your cities, put in by DARPA in the last five years, six years,
[00:14:28.419 --> 00:14:31.981]  They also want to put up some mind control wave systems.
[00:14:32.281 --> 00:14:34.322]  It's reasonable for your safety.
[00:14:35.682 --> 00:14:36.903]  Again, Boston Globe.
[00:14:38.103 --> 00:14:40.684]  So, and I've got Senate bills on it.
[00:14:40.744 --> 00:14:41.585]  I've got articles.
[00:14:41.645 --> 00:14:45.466]  I've got medical journals, scientific journals, prestigious reports.
[00:14:45.506 --> 00:14:46.607]  I mean, it's right out in the open.
[00:14:47.347 --> 00:14:49.268]  It's right out in the open and it sounds bizarre.
[00:14:49.308 --> 00:14:50.808]  It sounds like something you'd hear about in 2003.
[00:14:53.078 --> 00:14:58.803]  Remember back in the 70s, the 60s, the 40s, the 50s, you imagine the technology of the future.
[00:14:59.223 --> 00:15:05.268]  You know, we'd be flying around in silver spacesuits and little jetpacks and live like the Jetsons in 2003.
[00:15:05.968 --> 00:15:14.175]  Well, in truth, we live in a suppressed technological system, whereas the elite is 35 years ahead of what we're seeing on the surface.
[00:15:14.535 --> 00:15:16.297]  Now they're having to announce all this to us.
[00:15:16.597 --> 00:15:17.598]  So we are in 2003.
[00:15:19.648 --> 00:15:21.309]  And the technologies are there.
[00:15:21.649 --> 00:15:32.774]  The remote control cockroaches, the tiny hover drones looking through your walls, the mechanized forces, the remote control battle tanks.
[00:15:33.554 --> 00:15:34.335]  It's all there.
[00:15:34.475 --> 00:15:41.358]  The mutated super strains of viruses and bacteria that can kill entire races of humans.
[00:15:42.238 --> 00:15:43.178]  It's all there now.
[00:15:43.278 --> 00:15:44.399]  It's all here with us.
[00:15:44.459 --> 00:15:45.619]  It's been there for decades now.
[00:15:45.659 --> 00:15:48.961]  They're announcing it to us, so we'll get into that.
[00:15:50.245 --> 00:15:53.367]  People hearing persistent, mysterious hum aren't alone!
[00:15:53.387 --> 00:15:56.128]  Aren't alone!
[00:15:57.448 --> 00:15:59.209]  Isn't that interesting?
[00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:01.470]  We'll get into that story.
[00:16:02.631 --> 00:16:19.339]  And I saw an article out of the Rocky Mountain Newspaper, Rocky Mountain Cooligan Newspaper, and it says an email could get you arrested, arrest and censorship of subversive voices
[00:16:20.234 --> 00:16:43.266]  on the internet overseas and I read the article here and it's all about censorship in China and censorship in Vietnam and how if you send a protest email saying the government's wrong in any way they arrest you and they torture you and they re-educate you
[00:16:46.133 --> 00:16:57.607]  But, it's funny, about a month ago, the headline of the City Morning Herald was, activists arrested for unauthorized use of mobile phone.
[00:16:59.125 --> 00:17:05.409]  And it just calmly announced that, well, protest has been banned in Australia of the war of the WTO.
[00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:06.610]  This has been for two years now.
[00:17:07.351 --> 00:17:09.312]  Any type of major protest of level bodies.
[00:17:09.952 --> 00:17:17.877]  And a protest organizer sent an email, an instant message from his cell phone, non-threatening, saying we're against your war to the American Embassy.
[00:17:17.897 --> 00:17:21.039]  And the American Embassy pointed out the law and requested he be arrested.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:21.700]  Your government
[00:17:22.592 --> 00:17:23.212]  Requested it.
[00:17:23.252 --> 00:17:26.233]  He is being charged with major felony charges.
[00:17:26.273 --> 00:17:27.514]  He's facing years in prison.
[00:17:28.094 --> 00:17:29.214]  Man has no criminal record.
[00:17:29.254 --> 00:17:30.315]  He's a college student.
[00:17:31.995 --> 00:17:35.896]  And he is also on the faculty.
[00:17:35.936 --> 00:17:37.557]  He works for a professor there.
[00:17:38.949 --> 00:17:46.053]  He's part of the Green Party, whether you agree with him or disagree with him, certainly you agree he has a free speech right there, and it just says, well, he's been arrested.
[00:17:46.093 --> 00:17:47.634]  So I thought I'd mention that.
[00:17:47.674 --> 00:17:59.720]  You know, the stuff we always heard about in China, or Russia, or East Germany, or under the Nazis, and in the unified Germany of World War II, this is the stuff we read about and heard about, and now it's happening in the West.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.042]  If you say the word homosexual, you're arrested in England, they say it's a hate word.
[00:18:04.082 --> 00:18:04.982]  That's the BBC.
[00:18:05.062 --> 00:18:06.163]  They're unemployed, being arrested.
[00:18:06.543 --> 00:18:14.517]  If you criticize the EU as a minister, you're fired or arrested because the EU brings you freedom and happiness, and by criticizing it, you're taking other people's rights.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.066]  And they're moving here in this country to ban speech as well.
[00:18:20.271 --> 00:18:21.853]  And if we cave into it, it's over.
[00:18:22.193 --> 00:18:38.332]  It's like Diebold, the big electronic voting machine, one of the big companies, some of their own documents about how their machines are a fraud were posted on their website through a back door and then Harris got them and put them in a bunch of newspapers and Diebold admitted that they were real.
[00:18:40.157 --> 00:18:47.360]  Uh, they just said, uh, well, uh, anybody talks about them, writes articles about them, links to documents, we're gonna sue you!
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:54.043]  And they tried to threaten to sue a bunch of people, and people said, fine, go ahead and sue us, and they've dropped the suit, and now they're being sued.
[00:18:54.063 --> 00:18:58.184]  So, uh, we've got to stand up against censorship.
[00:18:59.045 --> 00:19:07.008]  Uh, it's easy to cower, and just say, okay, I won't send emails saying the government's wrong, I'll shut up.
[00:19:07.737 --> 00:19:10.359]  But if we do that, then they can move against us.
[00:19:10.459 --> 00:19:16.222]  If we all say no to the censorship, we can effect change and resist it.
[00:19:17.402 --> 00:19:18.343]  And it's got to be done.
[00:19:19.003 --> 00:19:23.646]  I mean, I don't agree with Nazis saying that Jews are Satan.
[00:19:25.147 --> 00:19:30.671]  I don't agree with Black Panthers, the modern Black Panther, Khalid Mohammed, saying kill all white people.
[00:19:31.232 --> 00:19:33.053]  And I'm not racist to say he's a racist.
[00:19:33.073 --> 00:19:34.054]  See, that's political correctness.
[00:19:34.094 --> 00:19:35.635]  See, I'll be arrested for saying he's bad.
[00:19:36.075 --> 00:19:36.836]  You're not allowed to do that.
[00:19:37.896 --> 00:19:43.000]  I am against some of the extreme Zionists who are obviously racist.
[00:19:43.926 --> 00:19:45.586]  And admittedly, in their own writings are.
[00:19:45.866 --> 00:19:47.227]  I'm against these people.
[00:19:47.807 --> 00:19:50.027]  Period.
[00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:55.809]  But if I try to take your right to criticize someone, then you can take my right.
[00:19:55.989 --> 00:20:06.831]  So, whether it's the Nazis, or whether it's Mecha, or the Black Panthers, or Radical Zionist, they have their right to say what they want.
[00:20:09.514 --> 00:20:11.495]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:20:11.575 --> 00:20:22.279]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:27.201]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:20:27.261 --> 00:20:38.585]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:20:39.185 --> 00:20:46.031]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:20:46.431 --> 00:20:48.573]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:20:49.053 --> 00:20:54.037]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[00:20:54.337 --> 00:21:00.482]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:00.502 --> 00:21:01.623]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:01.663 --> 00:21:02.304]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:21:09.689 --> 00:21:10.669]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:10.749 --> 00:21:15.530]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:23.492]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:23.752 --> 00:21:29.133]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:36.314]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:36.614 --> 00:21:41.957]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:21:42.217 --> 00:21:46.959]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:21:47.299 --> 00:21:54.902]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:21:55.242 --> 00:22:01.485]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:01.805 --> 00:22:02.926]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:05.649 --> 00:22:05.929]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:25.723 --> 00:22:26.303]  I think so.
[00:22:48.272 --> 00:22:50.355]  Simply log on to HerbalHealer.com.
[00:22:50.515 --> 00:22:54.980]  Check out our online member testimonials and our hundreds of exceptional products.

[00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.973]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:23:12.293 --> 00:23:12.633]  Yes.
[00:23:12.914 --> 00:23:17.717]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[00:23:17.837 --> 00:23:26.784]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, 2 ounces of juice have the same nutrition as 3 pounds of choice garden produce.
[00:23:26.924 --> 00:23:34.650]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[00:23:34.871 --> 00:23:36.732]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.

[00:24:01.918 --> 00:24:05.059]  Thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[00:24:14.742 --> 00:24:16.644]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:17.145 --> 00:24:19.948]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:22.492 --> 00:24:24.674]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2.
[00:24:25.715 --> 00:24:26.797]  Back from 9 to midnight.
[00:24:26.817 --> 00:24:27.578]  We're here live.
[00:24:28.658 --> 00:24:30.360]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.901]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:31.921 --> 00:24:31.981]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:34.784]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[00:24:35.184 --> 00:24:42.792]  In the next hour, we have a fellow on that we have on each week, Paul Joseph Watson, the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com, who does a fabulous job.
[00:24:53.977 --> 00:25:01.421]  Also the author of Order Out of Chaos, to give us his analysis of the week, the things he thinks are most important, and to take your calls.
[00:25:01.501 --> 00:25:09.265]  Third hour, I have the lawyer for the widow, and the widow coming on, who's suing Bush for treason, for collusion in 9-11.
[00:25:10.166 --> 00:25:14.768]  So that is coming up in the next hour.
[00:25:15.548 --> 00:25:16.429]  Or in the third hour.
[00:25:16.469 --> 00:25:18.890]  We've got Watson in the next hour, so you'll want to stay with us for that.
[00:25:18.930 --> 00:25:22.092]  But back to this Rocky Mountain Cooligan News article.
[00:25:24.091 --> 00:25:25.732]  An email could get you arrested.
[00:25:25.772 --> 00:25:28.893]  Arrest and censorship of subversive voices on the internet overseas.
[00:25:29.253 --> 00:25:39.877]  Somebody needs to email Meg Byrd the story out of the City Morning Herald where they're arresting people in Australia if they send non-threatening emails to the government.
[00:25:41.877 --> 00:25:44.938]  Again, I mean, people just aren't aware how bad it's gotten in the West.
[00:25:45.098 --> 00:25:49.780]  They need to send her the BBC articles where their own reporters are arrested if they say the word homosexual.
[00:25:50.518 --> 00:25:57.583]  Because again, if someone complains about a word, Scotland Yard may ban the word unilaterally, saying it's a hate word.
[00:25:58.004 --> 00:26:00.966]  And so the scientific word homosexual is illegal in England.
[00:26:01.547 --> 00:26:14.236]  I have Scotland Yard diversity unit head in the BBC articles saying, and in other stories saying, we've had people who've been arrested on, major reporters, we're talking news presenters, folks.
[00:26:14.496 --> 00:26:16.458]  The word homosexual, you are arrested.
[00:26:18.179 --> 00:26:20.141]  And they're moving to do that here in this country as well.
[00:26:21.105 --> 00:26:36.720]  It says, as the stainless steel mouse was released from jail in China last Sunday, that's his nickname, internet censorship and original arrest of mouse and other cyber dissidents became a visible issue yet again.
[00:26:37.438 --> 00:26:54.896]  Accused of posting internet articles criticizing the government, Mouse, the nickname of Chinese college student, Liu Dai, was jailed due to Chinese government's concern about political speech on the internet and its forceful attempts to monitor political speech aggressively and block particular web sites.
[00:26:56.577 --> 00:26:57.777]  Other people try that too.
[00:26:58.198 --> 00:27:03.282]  Particularly those that deal with taboo subjects like the band Falun Gon, the spiritual movement.
[00:27:03.522 --> 00:27:15.151]  According to the New York Times, posting about Tiananmen Square and human rights, Lou was seen as a subversive element by the government and arrested in her dorm room for her internet writings.
[00:27:16.231 --> 00:27:21.976]  Well, I mean, over in Genoa, Italy, they ran over people purposely with armored vehicles and backed back over them, killing one person.
[00:27:23.002 --> 00:27:28.326]  They attack people with rubber bullets and weapons and beat their heads in and hospitalize them here for no reason.
[00:27:28.366 --> 00:27:29.627]  That's been admitted a hundred times.
[00:27:29.947 --> 00:27:30.888]  Hire provocateurs.
[00:27:30.948 --> 00:27:32.389]  See, we're becoming that, folks.
[00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:35.792]  It looked like Tienanmen Square, didn't it, in Miami two weeks ago?
[00:27:35.832 --> 00:27:37.133]  Even Drudge had to admit that.
[00:27:39.474 --> 00:27:40.055]  Oh my goodness.
[00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:47.280]  With the Internet becoming a more and more popular form of expression around the world, concerns over governments violating the right to freedom of speech and the right to privacy
[00:27:48.291 --> 00:27:57.138]  In cases such as Lou's are growing and indeed are providing a category lesson for all nations dealing with the newer technology.
[00:27:57.778 --> 00:28:03.982]  As in China, recent arrest of cyber dissidents in Vietnam have caught the attention of human rights activists as well.
[00:28:04.503 --> 00:28:13.750]  In the recent crackdown, individuals have been arrested for exchanging emails with contacts in the Vietnamese grouping and posting articles critical of the government.
[00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:15.671]  Amnesty International says the situation.
[00:28:18.162 --> 00:28:22.484]  And Amnesty International is loyal opposition.
[00:28:24.945 --> 00:28:34.349]  They're totally UN-controlled, acting like they're doing something, only talking about China and other countries like that, never the Western world, although occasionally they'll say something's a little off, or a little amiss.
[00:28:35.649 --> 00:28:38.751]  So, again, it's not just in China that this is happening.
[00:28:39.951 --> 00:28:44.473]  Let me get back into this article, then we'll break, cover some more news, and get to your calls.
[00:28:46.045 --> 00:28:49.467]  Dean Bush may have been tipped to 9-11 attacks.
[00:28:49.547 --> 00:29:03.774]  It looks like ex-congressional nutball Cynthia McKinney has picked up some new support from her conspiracy theory that President Bush had advanced word of the 9-11 attacks from none other than Democratic presidential frontrunner Howard Dean.
[00:29:03.794 --> 00:29:04.274]  Now wait a minute.
[00:29:05.315 --> 00:29:06.676]  Ex-congressional nutball.
[00:29:08.216 --> 00:29:14.780]  When I interviewed her about a month and a half ago in San Francisco, where I was there speaking at the censored awards,
[00:29:15.552 --> 00:29:16.753]  Project Censored Awards.
[00:29:17.613 --> 00:29:20.054]  Most Censored Stories of 2003.
[00:29:21.855 --> 00:29:25.757]  While I was there, she talked about the UN Dying Corps Kidnapping Rings.
[00:29:25.797 --> 00:29:28.298]  That's been in hundreds of mainstream newspapers, admitted in court.
[00:29:28.998 --> 00:29:36.162]  She talked about how there should be an investigation of 9-11, how there's investigations of train wrecks or, you know, plane crashes, but not in this case.
[00:29:36.742 --> 00:29:37.602]  Real investigations.
[00:29:38.503 --> 00:29:40.724]  She talked about how the Democratic Party was controlled.
[00:29:42.403 --> 00:29:43.484]  I mean, nutball?
[00:29:43.584 --> 00:29:46.026]  I mean, just... And again, Howard Dean?
[00:29:46.106 --> 00:29:48.428]  I mean, he's shilling for the Globals.
[00:29:48.468 --> 00:29:49.428]  Wait to hear his quotes.
[00:29:50.469 --> 00:29:51.150]  It's amazing.
[00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.591]  So, that's coming up, too.
[00:29:54.732 --> 00:29:57.974]  You'll definitely want to stay with us for that.
[00:29:57.994 --> 00:29:58.475]  We'll be back.
[00:30:00.476 --> 00:30:01.377]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.877 --> 00:30:03.478]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.399 --> 00:30:07.081]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:06.626 --> 00:31:06.866]  P.O.
[00:31:06.906 --> 00:31:08.887]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[00:31:10.348 --> 00:31:16.552]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:31:17.013 --> 00:31:24.778]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:31:25.138 --> 00:31:30.702]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt
[00:31:31.047 --> 00:31:32.988]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:38.052]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:31:38.372 --> 00:31:43.076]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:31:43.616 --> 00:31:47.459]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:31:47.959 --> 00:31:48.980]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:09.924]  You've heard of it.
[00:32:10.004 --> 00:32:10.885]  You've searched for it.
[00:32:11.045 --> 00:32:11.765]  We have it.
[00:32:11.925 --> 00:32:19.508]  I'm talking about Coral Calcium by direct from the manufacturer and discover what thousands already know about the benefits of taking coral calcium supplements.

[00:32:35.293 --> 00:32:35.513]  I think?
[00:33:05.413 --> 00:33:05.734]  I think so.
[00:33:21.517 --> 00:33:25.799]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2, back from 9 to midnight, Alex Jones here live.
[00:33:25.859 --> 00:33:30.422]  Let me cover some more news, then we'll get to Brockham, Canada, others that are patiently holding.
[00:33:30.462 --> 00:33:33.163]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:33.503 --> 00:33:39.686]  We do have Paul Watson, one of our regular contributors, on in the next hour.
[00:33:39.726 --> 00:33:49.431]  Then in the third hour, we have one of the widows of 9-11 victims who's suing Bush for collusion in 9-11 and for, of course, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:33:50.574 --> 00:33:57.577]  Using the attacks for his own profit, but Bush is just a front man just like Mr. Dean or Mr. Gore or any of these creatures.
[00:33:58.377 --> 00:34:01.098]  But again, look at the propaganda spun by the neocons.
[00:34:01.118 --> 00:34:09.781]  If they can just make it a leftist issue, then when the average conservative driving along has been misled by these people hears it, they'll think, oh that's just a leftist lie.
[00:34:10.641 --> 00:34:11.962]  Well let me assure you it's not.
[00:34:12.762 --> 00:34:16.843]  Dean, Bush may have been tipped to 9-11 attacks.
[00:34:17.984 --> 00:34:18.904]  Now listen to Newsmax.
[00:34:20.936 --> 00:34:21.456]  Listen to this.
[00:34:22.017 --> 00:34:36.629]  It looks like ex-congressional nutball Cynthia McKinney has picked up some new support for her conspiracy theory that President Bush had advanced word of the 9-11 attacks from none other than Democratic presidential frontrunner Howard Dean.
[00:34:37.309 --> 00:34:44.175]  Dean said on Monday that President Bush is withholding documents related to 9-11 because they may show he knew what was coming.
[00:34:44.995 --> 00:34:55.660]  Most interesting theory that I've heard so far, which is nothing more than a theory, it can't be proved, see Schilling folks, is that he was warned ahead of time by the Saudis.
[00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:58.041]  Dean told a caller at Washington D.C.'
[00:34:57.961 --> 00:35:01.222]  's Diane Rehm Show according to a transcript obtained.
[00:35:02.253 --> 00:35:06.737]  Now, who knows what the real situation is, the presidential conspiracy theorist cautioned.
[00:35:07.158 --> 00:35:15.485]  He then added, but the trouble is, by suppressing that kind of information, you lead those kinds of theories whether they have any truth in them or not.
[00:35:15.846 --> 00:35:18.068]  Dean warned that the more theories like
[00:35:18.548 --> 00:35:21.850]  His get repeated, the more people tend to believe them.
[00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:24.191]  See, he's actually shilling for the globalists there, folks.
[00:35:24.651 --> 00:35:34.895]  So I think the president is taking a great risk by suppressing the key information that should go to the teen commission, which is appointed by Bush in business together with Bush.
[00:35:35.316 --> 00:35:40.958]  One of the people just got off the committee to be assigned to head up the big XM Bank.
[00:35:41.178 --> 00:35:42.439]  I mean, it's sick, folks.
[00:35:42.959 --> 00:35:43.159]  Ms.
[00:35:43.199 --> 00:35:54.885]  McKinney raised similarly explosive questions during a March 2002 radio interview when she demanded, what did this administration know and when did it know it about the events of September 11th?
[00:35:54.945 --> 00:35:55.645]  Who else knew?
[00:35:55.745 --> 00:35:56.346]  McKinney added.
[00:35:56.686 --> 00:36:00.648]  And why did they not warn the innocent people of New York who were needlessly murdered?
[00:36:01.108 --> 00:36:03.149]  What do they have to hide?
[00:36:03.169 --> 00:36:06.431]  Then under that they have an editor's note.
[00:36:06.471 --> 00:36:08.612]  Catastrophe reels Bill Clinton's role in 9-11.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:10.640]  Come on.
[00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:30.228]  In my film Road to Tyranny, we show, conclusively, how, in detail, how Bill Clinton, three separate times, had Sudan, and Afghanistan, and Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia, all offering to arrest Bin Laden from 96 right through to 2000.
[00:36:30.788 --> 00:36:33.549]  And every time, they would say, no thank you!
[00:36:34.702 --> 00:36:36.023]  Because he's a CIA asset.
[00:36:36.263 --> 00:36:47.092]  Then Bush comes in, signs W199I, ordering Robert Wright and others not to deal with the Bin Laden family or any of the Al Qaeda operatives in this country.
[00:36:48.914 --> 00:36:51.496]  Now people say, well, where's W199I?
[00:36:51.556 --> 00:36:54.679]  Well, portions of it were published by the BBC.
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.622]  Then they were threatened by the head of the censorship board,
[00:36:59.784 --> 00:37:02.505]  That's right, Lord Wakeham, the head, the chairman of N.M.
[00:37:02.545 --> 00:37:04.585]  Rothschild, who's also over the media in England.
[00:37:04.606 --> 00:37:06.486]  We've had Greg Powell and others on about this.
[00:37:06.506 --> 00:37:11.448]  I have a copy of W199I, the pages that were released in my book, Ascent to Tyranny.
[00:37:12.448 --> 00:37:15.749]  And folks, we have Robert Wright.
[00:37:16.554 --> 00:37:39.859]  Standing up at the National Press Club early last year, crying, FBI agent, big ol' six foot four guy, with David Shippers, and of course, the founder and head of Judicial Watch, Larry Klayman, holding up a letter from the Justice Department saying, we've been threatened with arrest if we tell you what we know, all we can say is, the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens!
[00:37:42.987 --> 00:37:46.609]  Now, that was the National Press Club broadcast on C-SPAN, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:51.232]  Broadcast on C-SPAN, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:52.172 --> 00:37:54.574]  Broadcast on C-SPAN, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:54.854 --> 00:38:06.041]  So there's W1999, not just in the BBC, not just the two pages that we have, not just the now-dead Deputy Director of the FBI, John O'Neill, who quit months before 9-11,
[00:38:07.567 --> 00:38:13.128]  And told British and French newspapers that, quote, the government's going to allow a massive attack as a pretext to go into Afghanistan.
[00:38:13.408 --> 00:38:14.509]  We don't just have all that!
[00:38:14.569 --> 00:38:16.129]  We have Robert Wright with a letter!
[00:38:16.409 --> 00:38:19.110]  We'll be arrested if we tell you what we know!
[00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:22.430]  That's what W199I said!
[00:38:24.471 --> 00:38:27.672]  And still people are in just abject denial about all this.
[00:38:29.612 --> 00:38:33.813]  And so they're... McKinney in her statement said, we need an investigation.
[00:38:34.714 --> 00:38:55.059]  And again, the media ignored all the conservatives and libertarians saying this across the political spectrum, ignored Ron Paul's questions about it, ignored Stanley Hilton, Bob Dole's former chief of staff, a Republican, suing Bush with 400 of the families of the victims, saying the government was involved in the attacks from their depositions of high-level officers.
[00:38:56.661 --> 00:39:02.143]  You've got the public officials being warned not to fly, the mayors, the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, Ashcroft, all of them.
[00:39:02.163 --> 00:39:02.883]  That's all admitted.
[00:39:02.923 --> 00:39:04.444]  Don't fly to New York on 9-11.
[00:39:04.484 --> 00:39:05.204]  Don't fly to D.C.
[00:39:05.244 --> 00:39:05.865]  on 9-11.
[00:39:06.265 --> 00:39:07.445]  Salman Rushdie being warned.
[00:39:07.465 --> 00:39:08.285]  That's the Times of London.
[00:39:08.466 --> 00:39:09.426]  We have all this.
[00:39:10.346 --> 00:39:11.707]  The hijackers trained at U.S.
[00:39:11.747 --> 00:39:12.587]  military bases.
[00:39:13.127 --> 00:39:14.488]  MSNBC, Pensacola News Journal.
[00:39:14.668 --> 00:39:15.468]  The insider trading.
[00:39:15.588 --> 00:39:15.948]  All that.
[00:39:16.389 --> 00:39:17.609]  Real questions.
[00:39:17.669 --> 00:39:22.751]  We've got answers, but to say that we shouldn't ask questions is even more ridiculous.
[00:39:23.871 --> 00:39:25.332]  But listen to Dean Schilling.
[00:39:26.956 --> 00:39:30.839]  Oh, well, it's of course no evidence of it, but it is a question.
[00:39:31.499 --> 00:39:36.723]  Everybody knows that they won't release that CIA briefing he got a week before 9-11.
[00:39:37.403 --> 00:39:43.107]  Everybody knows Bush had the launch orders two days before 9-11 on his desk to launch an attack on Afghanistan with 40,000, 44,000 U.S.
[00:39:43.147 --> 00:39:45.108]  troops, 18,000 British troops in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan.
[00:39:49.941 --> 00:39:59.344]  We know they have the head of Pakistani intelligence, the guy that wired $100,000 to Mohammed Adda, General Mahmood Ahmed, sitting there with the heads of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees eating breakfast.
[00:40:00.004 --> 00:40:07.967]  The New York Times and Associated Press reported that when the aide walked in to say the towers are under attack, they turned to them at the breakfast table and said, we know, and smiled.
[00:40:08.207 --> 00:40:13.389]  The CIA was running a drill at 8.30 in the morning of flying hijacked jets into buildings in New York and D.C.
[00:40:13.409 --> 00:40:15.329]  That's how they ordered Nordad to stand down.
[00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:16.850]  This is all on the record!
[00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:21.903]  I can go on and on rattling out facts for hours!
[00:40:24.106 --> 00:40:26.588]  That's why it's so important you get 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:40:26.608 --> 00:40:29.091]  That's why it's so important you get Masters of Terror.
[00:40:31.144 --> 00:40:37.309]  That's why it's so important you get my two videos on 9-11 and make 10 copies at least and give them as gifts this holiday season.
[00:40:37.749 --> 00:40:46.756]  Make copies of my videos, air them on AXS TV, give them to police chiefs and sheriffs and county commissioners and local talk show hosts and your pastors or your rabbis.
[00:40:47.136 --> 00:40:48.978]  Get them out to everybody!
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.822]  Because ignorance is what allows this to take place.
[00:40:53.882 --> 00:40:55.643]  So, I see these articles all the time.
[00:40:55.663 --> 00:40:58.185]  These ridiculous leftists have questions.
[00:40:59.082 --> 00:41:02.807]  Well, Bill Clinton had prior knowledge, so don't say Bush is bad.
[00:41:04.369 --> 00:41:08.695]  And the left can see the corruption of Bush, the right can see the corruption of Clinton.
[00:41:09.616 --> 00:41:13.742]  I mean, I've heard talk show hosts, and I've talked to friends who've heard their friends saying it.
[00:41:15.919 --> 00:41:28.128]  I've heard talk shows attack, in one segment, Hillary in Afghanistan on Thanksgiving, handing out turkeys, patting the troops on the back, talking about how brave she is, or her aides saying this.
[00:41:28.609 --> 00:41:32.051]  Total theater, total stunt, disgusting!
[00:41:32.832 --> 00:41:33.872]  She hates the troops.
[00:41:34.793 --> 00:41:35.694]  We're not hypocrites.
[00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:39.657]  George Bush, flying in for two and a half hours,
[00:41:40.382 --> 00:41:47.588]  Giving the turkeys, basically kidnapping the media, taking their cell phones and taking the batteries off, not telling them where they were going to another country.
[00:41:49.809 --> 00:42:03.019]  That's a total stunt, just like him making people take their ties off at rallies under threat of arrest because they want to look like common people, or made in the USA, spray-painted on boxes with the Made in China covered up, which is a felony, by the way, according to the Washington Post.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:05.161]  And the federal law, they quoted.
[00:42:05.561 --> 00:42:07.943]  Yeah, in a warehouse covering up where something was made is a felony.
[00:42:10.438 --> 00:42:20.963]  When Bush went into Africa, they bulldozed, this is the Associated Press, United Press International, they bulldozed hundreds of little shantytown homes on the main avenue from the airport because it would, quote, look bad.
[00:42:21.183 --> 00:42:23.505]  They arrested thousands, put them in sports stadiums.
[00:42:23.905 --> 00:42:28.267]  It staged, people, the landing on the aircraft carrier.
[00:42:28.527 --> 00:42:29.968]  A ridiculous stunt!
[00:42:33.573 --> 00:42:37.697]  But again, they make it all this left-right garbage, and I, for one, am sick of it.
[00:42:37.737 --> 00:42:38.737]  Now, coming up, U.S.
[00:42:38.858 --> 00:42:42.160]  fires Guantanamo defense team because they said it wasn't a real trial.
[00:42:43.501 --> 00:42:46.104]  Justices DeWay releasing Vince Foster death photos.
[00:42:46.404 --> 00:42:50.427]  Economy destroying Kyoto Protocol on global warming dies from lack of support.
[00:42:51.228 --> 00:42:55.592]  Cops connect 12 shootings along Ohio Highway.
[00:42:55.612 --> 00:43:01.076]  Mugabe envisions alternative world order headed by China.
[00:43:01.096 --> 00:43:01.617]  Ugh.
[00:43:02.515 --> 00:43:05.316]  Chinese military ready for necessary casualties over Taiwan.
[00:43:08.418 --> 00:43:09.218]  New York Times.
[00:43:09.258 --> 00:43:12.900]  People hearing persistent, mysterious hum aren't alone.
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:13.920]  It's real.
[00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.522]  That's all coming up.
[00:43:16.902 --> 00:43:18.243]  Let's go to Brock in Canada.
[00:43:18.263 --> 00:43:19.183]  Brock, good to hear from you.
[00:43:19.203 --> 00:43:19.543]  Welcome.
[00:43:19.863 --> 00:43:20.584]  Hello, Alex.
[00:43:21.144 --> 00:43:23.325]  I wanted to ask you a couple of things.
[00:43:23.425 --> 00:43:27.047]  First of all, could you explain this Pan-American Union?
[00:43:27.067 --> 00:43:30.388]  Well, I think you know what it is.
[00:43:30.428 --> 00:43:31.629]  Why don't you tell folks what it is?
[00:43:32.239 --> 00:43:48.603]  Well, I don't know a lot about it, but my take is that it will probably erode more jobs and bring more third-worlders in, and that the standard of living will go down.
[00:43:48.703 --> 00:43:49.923]  Is that basically it?
[00:43:51.083 --> 00:43:52.203]  Yeah, in a nutshell.
[00:43:52.503 --> 00:43:54.084]  And it will centralize power.
[00:43:54.124 --> 00:43:56.484]  It's not about profits for the general public or jobs.
[00:43:56.824 --> 00:43:59.245]  It's about total centralization of control.
[00:44:00.473 --> 00:44:06.137]  It's about bankrupting everyone, getting us into psychiatric care, into the criminal justice system, or onto welfare.
[00:44:06.457 --> 00:44:09.499]  Getting us onto the plantation, into the compact cities.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:12.561]  I'll answer your question, it'll take a couple minutes.
[00:44:12.601 --> 00:44:14.523]  Do you want to hold, or do you want to ask other questions?
[00:44:14.543 --> 00:44:16.504]  I'd like to hold and ask something else.
[00:44:16.604 --> 00:44:19.166]  Okay, let me try to go over this simply.
[00:44:20.947 --> 00:44:23.809]  They don't come to you and say, we're getting rid of your sovereignty.
[00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:27.772]  Forty-five years ago, they started the European Economic Community.
[00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:30.990]  It was just a steel tariff deal.
[00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.130]  They set up the bodies.
[00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.771]  Then ten years later, they expanded into more trade.
[00:44:36.192 --> 00:44:38.752]  Then they unify the border guards and the crossings.
[00:44:38.772 --> 00:44:45.114]  Then they start... If somebody's working in one European country but lives in another, they started paying their pension plans into the other countries.
[00:44:45.455 --> 00:44:49.416]  Merging their pension plans, like our social security being merged with Mexico.
[00:44:50.385 --> 00:45:03.235]  Then 10 years ago, these are done in 10-year phases, or 9-year phases when I've looked at it on a chart, they announced, okay, it's the European Union, one currency, they'd always said they weren't planning that, people had warned they were, one currency.
[00:45:03.575 --> 00:45:04.956]  Then what does the EU do?
[00:45:05.988 --> 00:45:08.330]  It gets rid of juries in the few countries there that had them.
[00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:11.132]  It reinstates double jeopardy, trying it twice for the same crime.
[00:45:11.372 --> 00:45:13.414]  It allows you to be arrested for your speech.
[00:45:14.154 --> 00:45:16.816]  It bans many forms of criticism of the government.
[00:45:17.837 --> 00:45:31.287]  It takes power from the national governments and gives dictatorial command and control power to the 10, now 15, now to be 25, if it's expanded to 10 more member states, EU board with a rotating presidency.
[00:45:31.907 --> 00:45:38.476]  It sets up a dictatorship, a friendly fascism as they call it, with a velvet glove over the iron fist.
[00:45:38.676 --> 00:45:48.949]  Now, simultaneously, the American Union has already been in full operation for five to ten years, depending on which expert you talk to or which document you look at, but they're always expanding it.
[00:45:49.770 --> 00:46:06.530]  Now that they're about to fully complete it, they announced the free trade area of the Americas, not just including from Alaska to Chile, but now over 20 Caribbean countries and another 15 Latin American nations, bringing the number to 36.
[00:46:08.857 --> 00:46:13.900]  With some tertiary connections to other island nations in the Atlantic, bringing the total up to 41.
[00:46:14.841 --> 00:46:19.003]  And so, meanwhile, Canada's already signing trade pacts with the EU.
[00:46:19.283 --> 00:46:26.807]  America is, under the WTO, that has three magistrates that control any disputes that are privately appointed in the private corporation.
[00:46:27.268 --> 00:46:29.269]  And so, it's world government.
[00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:31.370]  They congeal it into three blocks.
[00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.271]  I think?
[00:46:49.511 --> 00:46:58.836]  The WTO, with an iron fist, with three magistrates, controls all the trade, forces you to hand over your national sovereignty.
[00:46:59.156 --> 00:47:00.237]  It goes on and on.
[00:47:00.277 --> 00:47:10.842]  So it's world government here upon us, and the experts say it's going to get at least ten times worse in job losses if the free trade area of the Americas is fully implemented.
[00:47:10.882 --> 00:47:12.063]  It's now been signed onto.
[00:47:13.374 --> 00:47:18.116]  Well, how long do you think it'll take before we're totally decimated another couple of years?
[00:47:18.156 --> 00:47:21.217]  Or do you think there'll be enough resistance that it'll fall apart?
[00:47:42.455 --> 00:47:43.455]  Well, this is how it works.
[00:47:43.535 --> 00:47:44.515]  They come to the states.
[00:47:44.896 --> 00:47:48.216]  The feds take a dollar and thirty cents back with strings attached.
[00:47:48.256 --> 00:47:52.177]  They give them more and more mandated things they have to do.
[00:47:53.237 --> 00:47:58.259]  The economy is imploding and so the tax base is down and so the cities can't pay.
[00:48:00.299 --> 00:48:04.140]  They're running all these scams and so they increase the taxes.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:12.897]  That forces more people out of work, more repossessions, more bankruptcies, more government confiscations of homes and businesses.
[00:48:13.681 --> 00:48:21.587]  And then the feds will say that a national tax through gasoline with satellite tracker boxes, you'll see this announced nationally within a year and a half.
[00:48:21.767 --> 00:48:25.189]  It's already been done in about five states, but they're announcing to do it the next year.
[00:48:26.170 --> 00:48:42.582]  That will then be done as a new tax to be shared locally at the state and county level, city level, and then about 10% or about 12% of that will go to the UN, and so we'll have a global energy tax through Kyoto that was never meant to be implemented governmentally, but to be done quote privately.
[00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:45.051]  By the member nations.
[00:48:45.792 --> 00:48:49.413]  And the other thing I was going to ask, the white slavery rings?
[00:48:49.873 --> 00:48:50.153]  Yes.
[00:48:50.994 --> 00:48:53.275]  Could you explain that a little bit?
[00:48:53.835 --> 00:48:55.395]  Obviously government cover-up.
[00:48:56.056 --> 00:48:58.597]  Well, there's not even a cover-up.
[00:48:58.657 --> 00:49:04.739]  At PrisonPlanet.com we have elite sex rings and kidnap ring section.
[00:49:05.599 --> 00:49:10.261]  And we have Associated Press, Reuters, United Press International, BBC, London Telegraph.
[00:49:11.185 --> 00:49:11.726]  I don't know.
[00:49:11.766 --> 00:49:13.167]  There's like 50 articles on there.
[00:49:13.187 --> 00:49:14.088]  There's articles every day.
[00:49:14.148 --> 00:49:15.350]  We just posted 50 of them.
[00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.372]  I think there's more than 50 actually.
[00:49:18.072 --> 00:49:21.616]  And it's royalty with children's bodies being dug up.
[00:49:21.636 --> 00:49:24.859]  They're finding slave pits full of children in giant satanic arenas.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.241]  Women in cages.
[00:49:27.382 --> 00:49:32.465]  200,000 women and children kidnapped by Don Corr in the UN come out in court to employee suit them.
[00:49:32.725 --> 00:49:33.906]  Turned out it was all true.
[00:49:34.606 --> 00:49:35.527]  Nothing was done.
[00:49:36.307 --> 00:49:41.090]  Articles of over 1.2 million women in Europe, Europe-wide, disappearing every year.
[00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:43.311]  Giant slave ship brothels.
[00:49:44.032 --> 00:49:50.576]  As World Daily has reported, even during the Clinton administration, Clinton would go to these ships and enjoy himself.
[00:49:51.675 --> 00:49:53.076]  What is the purpose of this going on and on?
[00:49:53.136 --> 00:49:55.878]  In a nutshell, is it total control over the people that all these roads are leading to?
[00:50:11.878 --> 00:50:12.198]  Evil?
[00:50:12.278 --> 00:50:16.379]  Is it just to get total and absolute control by an oligarchy?
[00:50:16.499 --> 00:50:17.600]  What of oligarchies?
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.640]  What have they done?
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.800]  What did Nero do?
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.501]  He killed children.
[00:50:21.801 --> 00:50:22.801]  What did the Aztecs do?
[00:50:22.841 --> 00:50:23.521]  They killed children.
[00:50:23.541 --> 00:50:24.482]  What did the Nazis do?
[00:50:24.542 --> 00:50:26.562]  What did the Soviets do?
[00:50:26.782 --> 00:50:31.023]  The KGB has always trafficked and enslaved.
[00:50:31.043 --> 00:50:31.904]  This is what they do.
[00:50:32.144 --> 00:50:33.744]  This is what elites have always done.
[00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:36.605]  People are stunned by it because we've become so naive.
[00:50:37.925 --> 00:50:40.306]  I want listeners to understand, folks.
[00:50:41.078 --> 00:50:44.920]  When I say DynCorp kidnaps people, I have BBC AP articles.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:45.820]  I don't just say that.
[00:50:46.861 --> 00:50:47.981]  Again, this is true.
[00:50:48.682 --> 00:50:49.442]  This is true.
[00:50:50.102 --> 00:50:53.064]  It's happening, but it's in the back of a newspaper here or there.
[00:50:54.104 --> 00:50:56.686]  And then they'll whine and scream about Michael Jackson all day.
[00:50:57.466 --> 00:50:59.347]  It's multifaceted terrorism.
[00:51:00.427 --> 00:51:07.311]  It's total ruthless control by a criminal syndicate of sickos.
[00:51:07.411 --> 00:51:07.991]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:10.157 --> 00:51:12.659]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[00:51:12.739 --> 00:51:13.239]  Pollution.
[00:51:13.259 --> 00:51:13.559]  Pollution.
[00:51:13.599 --> 00:51:14.680]  Is it as healthy as you'd like it?
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:15.160]  Allergies.
[00:51:15.300 --> 00:51:15.601]  Asthma.
[00:51:15.621 --> 00:51:16.201]  Probably not.
[00:51:16.341 --> 00:51:17.082]  Well, listen to this.
[00:51:17.322 --> 00:51:26.288]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually six to ten times worse than the air outside?
[00:51:26.348 --> 00:51:27.228]  Six to ten times.
[00:51:27.248 --> 00:51:28.269]  How could that be, you ask?
[00:51:28.349 --> 00:51:28.609]  Worse.
[00:51:28.729 --> 00:51:30.050]  Think about what's inside your home.
[00:51:30.271 --> 00:51:30.891]  Air spray.
[00:51:30.991 --> 00:51:31.491]  Chemicals.
[00:51:31.511 --> 00:51:32.472]  Does anyone smoke?
[00:51:32.492 --> 00:51:32.732]  Fumes.
[00:51:32.912 --> 00:51:34.593]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[00:51:35.034 --> 00:51:36.595]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[00:51:36.655 --> 00:51:37.375]  Toxic fumes.
[00:51:37.415 --> 00:51:38.416]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[00:51:38.476 --> 00:51:38.816]  They rot.
[00:51:38.836 --> 00:51:39.237]  Your sofa.
[00:51:39.257 --> 00:51:39.697]  They go.
[00:51:39.737 --> 00:51:39.877]  Dirt.
[00:51:40.277 --> 00:51:40.777]  Into you?
[00:51:41.017 --> 00:51:41.717]  Into your children?
[00:51:41.737 --> 00:51:42.417]  Into their lungs?
[00:51:42.518 --> 00:51:43.278]  Am I scaring you?
[00:51:43.618 --> 00:51:44.518]  Remember this word.
[00:51:44.918 --> 00:51:45.638]  Puritech.
[00:51:45.678 --> 00:51:47.218]  P-U-R-I-T-E-C.
[00:51:47.258 --> 00:51:49.439]  Puritech makes the Pure Air System.
[00:51:49.619 --> 00:52:02.141]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[00:52:02.261 --> 00:52:03.522]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[00:52:03.542 --> 00:52:03.602]  888-491-4100.
[00:52:03.622 --> 00:52:04.682]  The Puritech Pure Air System.
[00:52:04.782 --> 00:52:05.482]  Online at puritech.com.
[00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:21.215]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:52:21.395 --> 00:52:28.959]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:29.219 --> 00:52:32.363]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:52:32.644 --> 00:52:38.411]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:52:38.672 --> 00:52:44.820]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:49.061]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:52:49.121 --> 00:52:51.022]  The water level is always visible.
[00:52:51.202 --> 00:52:57.124]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:52:57.384 --> 00:53:01.626]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:53:02.646 --> 00:53:04.847]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:53:14.571 --> 00:53:15.873]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:53:16.073 --> 00:53:21.821]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:53:22.101 --> 00:53:27.348]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:53:27.648 --> 00:53:31.754]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:53:31.954 --> 00:53:35.755]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:53:35.995 --> 00:53:40.637]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:53:40.717 --> 00:53:43.497]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:53:43.797 --> 00:53:46.978]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:53:47.018 --> 00:53:48.859]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:53:49.399 --> 00:53:53.620]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:21.295 --> 00:54:22.596]  Alright folks, we're back live.
[00:54:22.636 --> 00:54:23.537]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:54:24.277 --> 00:54:28.080]  Let's go back to the calls and into more news and of course with our guests coming up.
[00:54:28.961 --> 00:54:30.121]  Ishmael in Texas.
[00:54:30.221 --> 00:54:31.722]  Ishmael, you're on the air.
[00:54:31.762 --> 00:54:32.163]  Go ahead.
[00:54:32.183 --> 00:54:33.023]  Hi Alex.
[00:54:33.143 --> 00:54:34.144]  Firstly, good job.
[00:54:34.825 --> 00:54:44.852]  Secondly, I wanted to inform your audience about an approach they could maybe use this holiday season when they see their friends and family about chemtrails.
[00:54:44.932 --> 00:54:47.974]  Sometimes if you start off using words like aerosol or spray,
[00:54:48.703 --> 00:54:50.744]  Or even chemtrails, you turn these people off.
[00:54:51.344 --> 00:54:54.865]  And we all only have a small ring of people around us that we can inform.
[00:54:55.505 --> 00:54:57.026]  You need to do it right the first time.
[00:54:57.326 --> 00:55:00.567]  And I was thinking maybe an approach about something like this.
[00:55:00.647 --> 00:55:07.349]  Did you know that what you most often think are clouds in the sky is really jet pollution that will linger for two or three hours?
[00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:13.151]  Imagine if a truck's waste lingered in the sky for two hours after it left the rig.
[00:55:13.932 --> 00:55:17.633]  And I find this approach, accompanied by a little video I shot just yesterday,
[00:55:20.563 --> 00:55:26.594]  I wouldn't start by trying to wake people up with chemtrails because some planes are spraying something.
[00:55:26.614 --> 00:55:29.499]  You know, when I was a child they didn't stay up there for five hours.
[00:55:30.473 --> 00:55:33.336]  The government admits they've done a lot of high altitude stuff to us.
[00:55:33.877 --> 00:55:35.618]  Something is going on in some cases.
[00:55:35.698 --> 00:55:38.521]  Some people think any type of condensation trail is a chemtrail.
[00:55:38.561 --> 00:55:39.001]  It's not.
[00:55:40.022 --> 00:55:45.067]  I stick to stuff like the Patriot Act when I'm first talking to somebody or the cameras on the street corners.
[00:55:45.147 --> 00:55:48.451]  Things we can tangibly prove for them immediately.
[00:55:48.471 --> 00:55:50.873]  Definitely.
[00:55:54.164 --> 00:55:55.725]  I think that, yeah, definitely.
[00:55:55.805 --> 00:55:56.665]  I agree with you.
[00:55:56.805 --> 00:56:11.490]  I think each person has an issue that seems to strike them at a certain level and resonate, and for some reason this is one that resonates with me and it's one that I've... Well, ask people how the IRS takes your bank account without having you indicted or arrested or charged, without a court.
[00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:13.170]  How does that happen, America?
[00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:15.031]  I thought we had due process.
[00:56:16.363 --> 00:56:20.285]  Again, they're implementing tyranny here, one step at a time.
[00:56:20.305 --> 00:56:22.267]  And there's a lot of ways to wake people up.
[00:56:23.107 --> 00:56:25.508]  And most people go, well, why would they do something like that?
[00:56:25.569 --> 00:56:27.910]  Well, why did Ted Bundy kill people?
[00:56:28.230 --> 00:56:31.792]  You know, why did every other big leader in the world history engage in tyranny?
[00:56:32.252 --> 00:56:33.313]  Why is that the norm?
[00:56:33.393 --> 00:56:34.894]  Why do people deny the norm?
[00:56:36.635 --> 00:56:38.996]  Yeah, it's a difficult thing to be approached.
[00:56:39.096 --> 00:56:42.118]  I mean, there are some people who are even telling me, I don't think I want to see the video.
[00:56:42.158 --> 00:56:44.600]  That might be something I'm not ready to deal with.
[00:56:45.563 --> 00:56:52.608]  Well, yeah, you've got a comfort zone, a bubble, they think the world is just their mind, everything is themselves, so they just deny it.
[00:56:52.928 --> 00:56:53.749]  It doesn't exist.
[00:56:53.949 --> 00:56:59.413]  Yeah, radio station success lately has been to play Christmas music as early as the first day after October.
[00:56:59.853 --> 00:57:01.434]  We're extending Christmas to two months.
[00:57:01.554 --> 00:57:04.196]  It's because you have to have your head in the sand even longer.
[00:57:04.937 --> 00:57:05.477]  That's it.
[00:57:05.577 --> 00:57:06.838]  Hey, Ishmael, great points.
[00:57:06.878 --> 00:57:07.739]  Keep up the great work.
[00:57:07.779 --> 00:57:08.339]  God bless.
[00:57:08.459 --> 00:57:11.501]  We'll come back in the next hour, get some more calls from Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:57:12.262 --> 00:57:13.363]  Before I end this hour,
[00:57:14.423 --> 00:57:18.685]  I want to remind listeners I'm going to be in Houston, Texas, December 13th.
[00:57:18.725 --> 00:57:20.246]  That's a Saturday, 6 p.m.
[00:57:20.266 --> 00:57:23.588]  to about 11 at night, showing Road to Tyranny and They Live.
[00:57:24.008 --> 00:57:25.109]  Great place to network.
[00:57:25.289 --> 00:57:27.670]  I'll have the videos and books there available as well.
[00:57:28.511 --> 00:57:32.913]  You get to see both films for $10, and of course most of that goes to the movie theater, but they're great folks.
[00:57:33.053 --> 00:57:33.694]  Nice theater.
[00:57:33.974 --> 00:57:35.715]  Pizza, hamburgers, they got all the great stuff.
[00:57:36.435 --> 00:57:37.136]  For sale there.
[00:57:37.196 --> 00:57:37.976]  It's really nice.
[00:57:38.337 --> 00:57:45.021]  Hope to see you December 13th in Houston, Texas at the Alamo Draft House at the West Oak Shopping Center.
[00:57:45.041 --> 00:57:52.066]  You can order tickets online at Infowars.com or you can get directions there from the movie theater website.
[00:57:52.186 --> 00:57:53.107]  Hope to see everybody there.
[00:57:53.607 --> 00:57:54.868]  Also, I have made a
[00:57:56.013 --> 00:57:56.694]  Ten films.
[00:57:57.114 --> 00:57:58.575]  Matrix of Evil is the newest.
[00:57:58.635 --> 00:57:59.376]  It's now out.
[00:57:59.936 --> 00:58:03.339]  Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Frank Morales, Colonel Craig Roberts, myself.
[00:58:03.399 --> 00:58:04.400]  It's an amazing video.
[00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:05.520]  Two plus hours.
[00:58:06.601 --> 00:58:05.520]  $25.95.
[00:58:07.002 --> 00:58:08.763]  Order three or more of any of my ten videos.
[00:58:08.783 --> 00:58:10.584]  They drop down to $20 a piece.
[00:58:11.245 --> 00:58:13.607]  And we're carrying some new videos, like Eric Huffschmid's
[00:58:15.752 --> 00:58:18.735]  New film and his book, that's on Infowars.com.
[00:58:18.755 --> 00:58:20.917]  We have the Loss of Liberty video about the USS Liberty.
[00:58:21.478 --> 00:58:23.620]  Infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.040]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:37.413 --> 00:58:38.915]  Or, InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:58:38.955 --> 00:58:39.175]  Again, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:39.195 --> 00:58:42.579]  Or, just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:58:42.699 --> 00:58:43.459]  Get the videos.
[00:58:43.479 --> 00:58:45.041]  Get them out to people.
[00:58:45.061 --> 00:58:46.382]  Have an effect.
[00:58:46.483 --> 00:58:47.023]  We'll be right back.
[00:59:01.738 --> 00:59:06.240]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:10.661]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:59:10.681 --> 00:59:17.584]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:25.707 --> 00:59:26.347]  Big Brother.
[00:59:26.988 --> 00:59:27.968]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:28.764 --> 00:59:29.864]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:30.524 --> 00:59:31.345]  You want answers?
[00:59:32.105 --> 00:59:33.005]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:33.025 --> 00:59:37.426]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:37.846 --> 00:59:41.966]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:44.427 --> 00:59:45.647]  All right, my friends.
[00:59:46.227 --> 00:59:51.048]  We're now already into the second hour of this global transmission.
[00:59:53.769 --> 00:59:55.329]  Now, presidential hopeful
[00:59:56.599 --> 01:00:00.142]  Democrat Howard Dean is saying, hmm, what's Bush covering up with 9-11?
[01:00:00.243 --> 01:00:02.244]  They're trying to make it a left-right issue.
[01:00:03.205 --> 01:00:03.486]  U.S.
[01:00:03.546 --> 01:00:07.289]  has fired Guantanamo defense team because they demanded a real trial.
[01:00:09.091 --> 01:00:12.094]  They're saying a new superflu could kill millions of people.
[01:00:12.114 --> 01:00:13.675]  They're trying to fearmonger with that.
[01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:14.756]  A bunch of keynotes.
[01:00:15.197 --> 01:00:18.780]  They're talking about a left-right world government trying to sell that to you.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.622]  It's all coming up.
[01:00:21.343 --> 01:00:24.524]  In this hour, and of course, your phone calls as well at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:24.544 --> 01:00:25.625]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:25.645 --> 01:00:34.708]  We're going to take a lot of calls with our guest, Paul Watson, who I'd like to have on for at least an hour each week.
[01:00:34.729 --> 01:00:37.490]  He is the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:47.954]  In the third hour, you'll definitely want to stay with us for this, we have Elaine Marinari coming on the show.
[01:00:49.182 --> 01:00:57.977]  And her lawyer, Philip Berg, 9-11 victim's wife, plans to fight for her late husband's honor by taking on the US government.
[01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:00.060]  And here's the headline, 9-11 in Neverland.
[01:01:02.614 --> 01:01:05.875]  Press ignores, widows, Bush treason lawsuit.
[01:01:05.895 --> 01:01:13.276]  We read her letter a few days ago, Monday on the show, where she comes right out with it and says, Bush, I believe you were involved in this.
[01:01:13.296 --> 01:01:21.117]  You let this happen to get a police state going to make money in these no-bid contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:01:21.917 --> 01:01:25.338]  And we're going to expose you, and more people every day are waking up to what you're doing.
[01:01:25.358 --> 01:01:26.398]  So they're joining us in the third hour.
[01:01:26.418 --> 01:01:31.879]  Paul Watson, thank you for coming on the show, and thanks for your wonderful work.
[01:01:32.700 --> 01:01:34.681]  And there's so much news today.
[01:01:35.021 --> 01:01:36.142]  What's on your mind?
[01:01:36.202 --> 01:01:37.963]  What's most important to you right now?
[01:01:37.983 --> 01:01:39.964]  Paul?
[01:01:40.104 --> 01:01:50.950]  One of the top stories that we've got on the website at the moment is this so-called mysterious hum coming out of New Mexico, Indiana and other places.
[01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:52.851]  And that's out of the New York Times, by the way.
[01:01:52.871 --> 01:01:57.594]  Yeah, I mean, obviously this hum has been reported on for years, I remember.
[01:01:58.295 --> 01:02:00.776]  Two years ago, ABC News did a big report on it.
[01:02:01.443 --> 01:02:13.789]  And the same thing has been reported in Europe as well, and the official investigations have always concluded that it's not mass psychosis or any other easily explainable event.
[01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:22.974]  In actual fact, just noticing this story today reminded me of something that I was watching on television two nights ago.
[01:02:23.928 --> 01:02:33.454]  Which overlaps with a subject which we sometimes cover, which is the brainwashing and manipulation of the collective unconsciousness via television.
[01:02:34.014 --> 01:02:35.855]  Which is, I mean, it's no deep subject.
[01:02:35.895 --> 01:02:45.460]  We know that the collective unconsciousness is defined traditionally as the body of knowledge that is sort of mutually shared by humanity.
[01:02:45.781 --> 01:02:50.884]  And there's patents to use television as a mind control device via the flickering.
[01:02:50.924 --> 01:02:51.364]  How does a
[01:02:52.333 --> 01:02:57.114]  How does a psychologist, you know, hypnotize you but with the light, the flashing light, the swinging watch?
[01:02:57.515 --> 01:02:59.255]  It's a thousand times more sophisticated.
[01:02:59.555 --> 01:03:01.636]  We have patents in the fifties on this.
[01:03:01.716 --> 01:03:03.336]  Now it's all over scientific journals.
[01:03:03.396 --> 01:03:04.737]  It's in Senate bills.
[01:03:04.817 --> 01:03:10.858]  It's in the New York Times, ABC News, and they send scientists out who hear the hum themselves.
[01:03:11.278 --> 01:03:11.578]  Go ahead.
[01:03:14.071 --> 01:03:32.581]  Basically, the collective unconsciousness boils down to, it's where we get the term common sense from really, but with the onset of mass media, this collective unconsciousness has been warped to the point where the elite can use it to create these stereotypes and false belief paradigms in the minds of the masses.
[01:03:33.201 --> 01:03:42.886]  And how this interfaces with this mysterious home story out of the New York Times is that I was actually watching an episode of The X-Files just two nights ago,
[01:03:43.447 --> 01:03:55.739]  And the plot was that a mysterious sound was causing people and animals to have a pulsating pain in their inner ear, and the New York Times report talks about similar sort of symptoms.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:01.625]  And the Boston Globe a few months ago had a report about how DARPA wants to deploy mind control towers.
[01:04:02.406 --> 01:04:06.410]  Yeah, and the main victim of the plot in this X-Files episode
[01:04:07.245 --> 01:04:12.069]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:16.972]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:16.992 --> 01:04:19.074]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:04:19.094 --> 01:04:21.516]  The New World Order.
[01:04:36.852 --> 01:04:37.873]  Can emerge.
[01:04:37.893 --> 01:04:42.117]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:42.177 --> 01:04:49.123]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:49.243 --> 01:04:51.225]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:51.716 --> 01:04:51.956]  Oh my-
[01:05:21.976 --> 01:05:26.679]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:05:26.839 --> 01:05:27.440]  Yes, it's true.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.221]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:05:30.341 --> 01:05:34.344]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:05:34.424 --> 01:05:35.004]  You heard it right.
[01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:40.107]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:05:40.227 --> 01:05:41.248]  The list goes on and on.
[01:05:41.508 --> 01:05:45.530]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.
[01:05:45.630 --> 01:05:47.751]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[01:05:47.952 --> 01:05:49.152]  This is a limited time offer.
[01:05:49.252 --> 01:05:53.515]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[01:05:53.695 --> 01:05:55.496]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may miss out forever.
[01:05:58.097 --> 01:06:02.639]  However, to participate in this limited time offer and have your drugs prescribed over the phone for free, you need to call 1-800-615-7094 now.
[01:06:02.739 --> 01:06:06.901]  That's 1-800-615-7094 for drugs like Phentermine, Ambien, Fioriset, Sama, Ultram, Viagra and many more.
[01:06:07.021 --> 01:06:08.481]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[01:06:08.501 --> 01:06:09.482]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[01:06:20.658 --> 01:06:29.285]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:06:29.505 --> 01:06:40.774]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:06:40.994 --> 01:06:43.656]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:06:43.997 --> 01:06:48.100]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:50.421]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:06:50.601 --> 01:06:52.461]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:06:52.661 --> 01:06:58.683]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[01:06:58.943 --> 01:07:04.605]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:07:17.809 --> 01:07:19.149]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:07:25.731 --> 01:07:26.371]  Big Brother.
[01:07:27.031 --> 01:07:28.052]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:28.792 --> 01:07:29.892]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:30.552 --> 01:07:31.372]  You want answers?
[01:07:32.133 --> 01:07:33.053]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:33.693 --> 01:07:37.394]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:37.874 --> 01:07:40.215]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:07:41.121 --> 01:07:41.982]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:52.508]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:53.089 --> 01:07:57.612]  We're now eight minutes and 30 seconds into the second hour of this global show.
[01:07:57.632 --> 01:07:59.653]  It's broadcast.
[01:08:01.134 --> 01:08:07.598]  And we're talking to Paul Watson, who joins us for at least an hour each week of our 30 hours of broadcasting we do here on this show.
[01:08:08.917 --> 01:08:10.939]  He is the webmaster of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:10.959 --> 01:08:15.083]  He's also a very astute researcher who I respect.
[01:08:15.984 --> 01:08:20.569]  And we're talking about all the articles that he thinks are most important today in this hour.
[01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:25.534]  People hearing persistent, mysterious hum aren't alone.
[01:08:27.115 --> 01:08:33.642]  And in my book, Descent into Tyranny, in the film Road to Tyranny, I have the Associated Press, ABC News articles,
[01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:54.899]  Where they send scientists out, and there is an ultra low frequency hum over entire towns, sometimes over neighborhoods, and in the Boston Globe a few months ago, there's a link to it in my DARPA Engineering the Beast System article in the News and Focus section of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and they say in the Boston Globe that, well,
[01:08:56.249 --> 01:09:01.894]  DARPA, they're the folks that give you Total Information Awareness Network, or betting on our dead soldiers, or where the next attack's coming.
[01:09:01.934 --> 01:09:02.995]  You know, you've heard about all that.
[01:09:03.035 --> 01:09:05.037]  And the Pentagon spying on you.
[01:09:05.057 --> 01:09:14.566]  Read the LA Times article again on Monday, where the head of NORTHCOM, General Eberhardt, says the troops are going to be running your life and on the streets, and it's a good thing.
[01:09:15.607 --> 01:09:16.688]  So this is real, folks.
[01:09:16.708 --> 01:09:17.569]  This is a real group.
[01:09:17.969 --> 01:09:20.612]  And they said to the Boston Globe that, well, we also want to deploy
[01:09:22.293 --> 01:09:28.649]  Frequency wave systems on the cell towers to deal with crowds and riots and to control people.
[01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:45.552]  And they admit, and I have Marines on videotape talking about sound wave weapons and ultra-low frequency weapons that can make you happy, make you sick, make you soil yourself, kill you, microwave weapons that burn your skin, and we have the Senate bill on InfoWars.com that talks about these weapons.
[01:09:45.972 --> 01:09:48.173]  There's patents going back to the fifties on them.
[01:09:48.553 --> 01:09:49.894]  This is real!
[01:09:49.994 --> 01:09:53.055]  Now, are there schizophrenics running around thinking microchips are in their heads?
[01:09:53.575 --> 01:09:53.935]  Yes!
[01:09:55.916 --> 01:09:57.517]  But, funny that
[01:09:59.213 --> 01:10:22.851]  Aldous Huxley, whose brother was the head of UNESCO, the first solicitor, the first Secretary General of UNESCO, he said in his last speech, given in 1962 that we've aired here at Berkeley, that he's the guy that wrote Brave New World, he said, look, they've hooked microscopic transmitters, devices, small units, with wires coming out of their heads.
[01:10:23.251 --> 01:10:26.614]  I've been to mental institutions in England where they are remote controlling people,
[01:10:27.896 --> 01:10:28.597]  He said as early as 1960.
[01:10:30.278 --> 01:10:31.740]  And now you've heard them on the news.
[01:10:31.780 --> 01:10:33.381]  The Verichip is for buying and selling.
[01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:34.182]  Oh, it's so good.
[01:10:34.582 --> 01:10:37.805]  Oh, they did a contract with California Bureau of Prisons to put it in the prisoners.
[01:10:38.085 --> 01:10:39.867]  Until people found out about it, they cancelled it.
[01:10:39.907 --> 01:10:41.408]  That's Reuters and AP.
[01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:45.152]  Yes, this bizarreness is going on.
[01:10:45.652 --> 01:10:48.915]  And the schizophrenics started thinking they had chips in them back in the 60s.
[01:10:50.753 --> 01:10:52.774]  Maybe some of these really did have chips in them.
[01:10:52.814 --> 01:10:54.614]  We know that Huxley says they did.
[01:10:54.654 --> 01:11:01.256]  We know we have documents as early now as the 40s where they were doing experiments with these types of systems.
[01:11:01.616 --> 01:11:03.896]  We know Mingala, who was brought here by the U.S.
[01:11:03.916 --> 01:11:09.438]  government, was putting wires into people's brains that he was torturing to death, among other horrors.
[01:11:09.538 --> 01:11:18.620]  So we know this is going on, but I would imagine that about 90% of the schizos out there aren't having this happening to them, but some really are.
[01:11:19.494 --> 01:11:23.077]  And now we have this big hum that the New York Times is talking about.
[01:11:23.617 --> 01:11:27.320]  In the film Road to Tyranny, we have just two minutes of the film is about this.
[01:11:28.101 --> 01:11:41.612]  Two and a half hours long, it's just all jam-packed, but two minutes of the film, three minutes of the film is about the Senate bill covering this, and the Kokomo hum in Indiana, and the scientific test, and the Shomer Tech
[01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:51.287]  A law enforcement catalog that says we disable speakers and we stop political rallies with our supersonic nausea machine.
[01:11:51.727 --> 01:11:54.209]  Police have used these at a lot of rallies to great effect.
[01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:57.691]  It's an ultra low frequency hum and makes everybody sick.
[01:11:59.513 --> 01:12:01.594]  And we did a test with one of these one time.
[01:12:02.495 --> 01:12:07.498]  We told folks we're going to be doing a test of something with three or four people that were in the room.
[01:12:07.638 --> 01:12:08.379]  We'll see what happens.
[01:12:08.399 --> 01:12:10.360]  We turned it on and everybody started getting sick.
[01:12:11.056 --> 01:12:11.837]  Within a few minutes.
[01:12:12.778 --> 01:12:14.459]  And this is about a $200 unit.
[01:12:15.059 --> 01:12:29.591]  Paul Watson, I'm just shooting out the info at folks because this isn't a conspiracy theory, but by having the X-Files bring it out, and then as you mentioned, mix in anti-Semitism, I mean, they'll say if you're pro-gun you're an anti-Semite.
[01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:33.554]  They'll say it's just a horrible label to put on people.
[01:12:33.995 --> 01:12:36.877]  So I guess the New York Times is anti-Semitic writing an article about this.
[01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:39.659]  I guess ABC News is using this tactic.
[01:12:39.699 --> 01:12:40.400]  Please continue.
[01:12:41.107 --> 01:12:42.187]  Well, yeah, that's the point.
[01:12:42.687 --> 01:12:56.651]  Running parallel to all these Boston Globe, New York Times articles, we've got the X-Files, you know, having the people that say that this is going on also believing in an international Jewish conspiracy to create a new world order.
[01:12:56.691 --> 01:13:06.854]  And then, at the end of the program, it turns out that the government was behind it, but there's one point where the Mulder character's talking about the Tau Hum in association with
[01:13:07.498 --> 01:13:07.958]  I don't
[01:13:27.207 --> 01:13:34.931]  Uh, Order Outta Chaos, a whole section on this where they admit they're driving and funding the whole fake UFO disclosure movement, which is really the government.
[01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:45.236]  All these big national radio shows that talk endlessly about it are there to tie in... We'll take the X-Files back when I'd watch it, every episode.
[01:13:45.356 --> 01:13:48.697]  FEMA's taking over, secret government, it's run by green aliens, the North Pole.
[01:13:49.038 --> 01:13:49.738]  Or the South Pole.
[01:13:50.539 --> 01:13:53.161]  So exactly, folks, this is the tactic.
[01:13:53.501 --> 01:14:04.288]  We're talking bills, documents, patents, Boston Globe, AP, ABC News, New York Times admitting it's happening, but simultaneously... Well, here's another example.
[01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:16.476]  As early as 1994, when I really got politically active, I would hear the buzzword, if you said the government was corrupt in any way, that you must be part of the black helicopter cult who were terrorists.
[01:14:17.114 --> 01:14:19.998]  I began to hear radio commercials, you know, ads for stuff.
[01:14:20.018 --> 01:14:27.328]  They just make a joke about, oh, he believes in black helicopters and, you know, washing cars on Mars by Dish Network.
[01:14:27.368 --> 01:14:29.050]  You know, you'd hear Dish Network ads.
[01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:30.712]  You'd hear talk show hosts talk about it.
[01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:31.714]  You'd see it in news articles.
[01:14:32.074 --> 01:14:44.884]  Then suddenly they release black helicopters on us, burning buildings, explosions, police chiefs throwing them out, bullets going into restaurants in Miami at midnight, foreign troops, checkpoints, total bedlam in hundreds of cities.
[01:14:44.904 --> 01:14:46.205]  We go out and shoot video of it.
[01:14:46.246 --> 01:14:48.167]  It's in all the big newspapers.
[01:14:48.607 --> 01:14:57.274]  But still, we're now a kook to talk about the black helicopters, which they demonize talking about black helicopters before they release them on us.
[01:14:57.294 --> 01:14:57.795]  Go ahead, Paul.
[01:14:58.499 --> 01:15:07.649]  Well, yeah, and then in another episode of The X-Files, they've got a right-wing extremist group which wants to bring down the government and which believes in the New World Order, which is...
[01:15:09.082 --> 01:15:12.764]  Passing on this deadly pathogen that eats people's skin.
[01:15:13.025 --> 01:15:18.028]  So again, basically it's every other episode that we see this kind of tactic.
[01:15:18.088 --> 01:15:21.850]  I mean, it didn't end with the Clinton administration, which is what a lot of people think.
[01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:29.095]  It's still going on today in programs like Frasier and 24 and Threat Matrix, which we've discussed in the past.
[01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:34.263]  Every episode of Threat Matrix in 24, they're torturing people.
[01:15:34.343 --> 01:15:36.445]  It's good to torture them, in some cases, to death.
[01:15:37.406 --> 01:15:39.248]  The evil right-wingers work with the Muslims.
[01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:41.070]  They're going to release bio-weapons at any minute.
[01:15:41.350 --> 01:15:48.878]  Then we've got, in the real world, the head of NORTHCOM, the former head of CENTCOM, saying martial law will come after the next attack.
[01:15:49.038 --> 01:15:51.301]  Oh, we are going to hate running your lives.
[01:15:51.741 --> 01:15:53.503]  I mean, it's so obvious what they're setting up.
[01:15:54.673 --> 01:16:06.338]  Yeah, and then with the Marshall Law thing, we've got, according to the latest leaked News Network memo, which proved to be quite accurate in the past, this Tommy Franks thing didn't just end at Tommy Franks.
[01:16:06.418 --> 01:16:14.281]  It's apparently high-level discussion in the White House about Marshall Law at the moment, which has obviously been the case for a while, but just coming to the fore.
[01:16:14.361 --> 01:16:15.462]  Okay, I missed that.
[01:16:15.562 --> 01:16:17.042]  Is this on Prison Planet right now?
[01:16:18.323 --> 01:16:19.823]  It's not on Prison Planet yet.
[01:16:20.324 --> 01:16:21.364]  It'll be up there tonight.
[01:16:22.164 --> 01:16:23.865]  Well, cover this for me.
[01:16:25.017 --> 01:16:31.105]  Basically, the leaked news network memos are put out by the Bonds Tribune Review.
[01:16:31.165 --> 01:16:33.808]  And in the past, that info turned out to be accurate?
[01:16:34.188 --> 01:16:40.676]  Yeah, it's basically a source within the media that's leaking what they're being told to cover up what they're being told to whitewash.
[01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:42.639]  Can you get that up on Prison Planet during a break?
[01:16:44.261 --> 01:16:45.482]  I can't, it'll be a rush, but I'll try.
[01:16:45.502 --> 01:16:48.325]  I've now heard reports that Mr. I Love Martial Law Savage is saying how wonderful this would be.
[01:17:08.075 --> 01:17:14.401]  The troops in Iraq are basically on the verge of mutiny, and they're expecting some kind of mass outpouring.
[01:17:14.421 --> 01:17:16.583]  Well, they haven't been paid in too much.
[01:17:17.404 --> 01:17:21.328]  Well, yeah, and I mean, they get charged $70 to make an hour phone call to the wives.
[01:17:21.368 --> 01:17:22.529]  So, I mean, what do you expect?
[01:17:22.549 --> 01:17:30.096]  The body armor hasn't even got out there yet, which is why we're getting mass casualties, which are being covered up by the media.
[01:17:31.736 --> 01:17:40.099]  And now it's turned out that indeed they lied about the 54 men in black uniforms being killed in Sahara, or however you pronounce it.
[01:17:40.579 --> 01:17:43.800]  It turns out that that's a total fabrication.
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:45.280]  They just went in and killed a bunch of people.
[01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:52.282]  Yeah, and that only got out because basically Iraqis on the ground were saying it.
[01:17:52.322 --> 01:17:58.104]  I mean, we don't really know for sure what happened because... Well, we know the press went to the hospitals and found a few kids with their legs half blown off.
[01:17:59.065 --> 01:18:05.667]  Yeah, I mean the original reports were false because basically the independent media in Iraq has been shut down.
[01:18:05.727 --> 01:18:14.308]  We had all these stories that came out a couple of months ago about how there were dozens of new newspapers being published in Iraq and how it was an indicator of free speech.
[01:18:14.328 --> 01:18:16.509]  And now they've raided them in TV stations.
[01:18:17.089 --> 01:18:20.750]  Yeah, any newspaper that criticised the Iraqi governing council
[01:18:21.688 --> 01:18:31.452]  Half of which members have never even stepped foot inside Iraq before April, and the rest of which are basically international fugitive criminals like Shalibi.
[01:18:32.213 --> 01:18:40.136]  Anyone who was caught criticizing them was arrested, tortured, some even killed, in all 11 newspapers.
[01:18:40.276 --> 01:18:46.379]  And there was a public order to kill Western reporters, and they had tanks pull right up and shoot people and blow up hotels.
[01:18:46.419 --> 01:18:47.019]  This was admitted.
[01:18:47.839 --> 01:19:02.905]  Yeah, and that was out of the BBC, and you'll also remember that an Iraqi was arrested for making, quote, anti-coalition statements, according to the Associated Press, and he was just on the side of the road, basically, and they handcuffed him, put mask tape around his mouth, and took him off to the prison camp.
[01:19:05.045 --> 01:19:06.446]  I want to get back into this, Tom.
[01:19:06.486 --> 01:19:14.629]  I want to get into the newest leaked documents that I wasn't aware of about Loving Marshall Law, and get into a bunch of other news.
[01:19:15.379 --> 01:19:19.420]  With Paul Watson, I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.

[01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:13.132]  That's www.vacationA, the numeral 2, the letter Z, dot com.
[01:23:13.273 --> 01:23:17.115]  Visit today and you can be saving big dollars tomorrow, even if you're not taking a vacation.
[01:23:30.857 --> 01:23:48.423]  Do you have a comment or a question about martial law, what its definition is, what it means for America, about the bizarre ultra-low frequency humming going on around the Western world making people ill, the government's announcements that they're deploying this stuff against us for our own good?
[01:23:50.535 --> 01:23:54.357]  Well, we've got Paul Watson online with us, and coming up in the next segment, we're going to take some calls.
[01:23:54.397 --> 01:23:57.539]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:57.559 --> 01:24:05.484]  If you disagree with us, or you agree with us, or you have a question or comment, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:05.504 --> 01:24:12.228]  Whether you're calling from Austin, Texas, or Rhode Island, or Albuquerque, New Mexico, you're welcome to join us at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:17.839 --> 01:24:26.465]  Paul Watson, who I know is typing away, posting this latest leaked memo from the media about how there's White House discussions of martial law.
[01:24:26.925 --> 01:24:30.847]  Sir, there have been open discussions of military dictatorship.
[01:24:30.907 --> 01:24:40.553]  We have the Gannett News Service a few months ago with Sid Kasperson of FEMA and with the state saying that if there's a red alert, we're virtually under martial law, was the quote.
[01:24:40.894 --> 01:24:43.215]  Virtually all your freedoms will be stripped from you.
[01:24:43.255 --> 01:24:44.356]  You can't leave your home.
[01:24:45.758 --> 01:24:47.880]  Yeah, they've been preparing for a long time.
[01:25:04.511 --> 01:25:21.021]  I've just posted that leaked news memo and in fact even the one before that talks about how Wolfowitz was talking about reinstating the draft which is along similar lines but this recent one states, quote, recent publication of an interview with General Franks
[01:25:21.522 --> 01:25:25.265]  Bring up the institution of martial law by the administration.
[01:25:25.746 --> 01:25:29.429]  There has been some muted but high level discussions of this subject.
[01:25:29.869 --> 01:25:38.256]  And it says that Frank is a functioning idiot, but the idea of Bush winning the election like he did the last one by outright fraud is a topic inside the Beltway.
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:39.782]  I don't think so.
[01:25:53.777 --> 01:26:03.285]  And I have to say that that group has put out some very accurate info in the past with their moles inside the major broadcast media, but again, everything they're discussing is already out in the open.
[01:26:03.986 --> 01:26:12.373]  That's why I've been saying and beating the drum, it's so important to expose who stands to gain from terrorism, but not just motive, then the concrete evidence, Paul.
[01:26:13.634 --> 01:26:22.301]  Yeah, and they also talk about how the attacks in Iraq, some of them have been staged, which is what we've reported from the evidence, and the fact that
[01:26:22.682 --> 01:26:27.345]  Their reporters are, in Iraq, being threatened, which has also come out in the mainstream media.
[01:26:27.365 --> 01:26:33.669]  So, basically, they're just confirming a few things and giving the perspective on what future events will hold.
[01:26:33.729 --> 01:26:38.473]  And, as I've said in the past... And again, these are reported to be high-level executive discussion meetings.
[01:26:39.533 --> 01:26:46.858]  Yeah, within top news networks, and they're being leaked to the Barnes Review, and they've been posting them over the past few months.
[01:26:48.379 --> 01:26:50.621]  And that's a separate Barnes Review from the...
[01:26:51.937 --> 01:26:53.078]  From the folks with the spotlight.
[01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:56.900]  You know, Paul, there's so much here.
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:58.041]  There's so much happening.
[01:26:58.582 --> 01:27:01.324]  A lot of people think we're going to see the terror attack during the election.
[01:27:01.404 --> 01:27:06.287]  Others think they're going to drop the hammer after the election and drop the hammer on the economy.
[01:27:06.307 --> 01:27:08.348]  We have the dollar plunging, gold surging.
[01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:10.110]  Meanwhile, the stock market's up.
[01:27:10.250 --> 01:27:16.194]  But only because the dollar's been so devalued, you're going to see some increase in stock value just because of that exchange ratio.
[01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:23.867]  Well yeah, we've got George Soroff saying that, you know, I want to bring down Bush speculating against the dollar so it'll crash.
[01:27:24.288 --> 01:27:34.931]  But then you have other Rothschild minions out there, like Buffett with him, and you've got Bush bad-mouthing the dollar, so really they're all together.
[01:27:35.612 --> 01:27:40.273]  Yeah, so it's basically a European and US Anglo double team.
[01:27:40.293 --> 01:27:44.735]  I mean, we got the same thing with the airline developments recently.
[01:27:45.370 --> 01:27:55.395]  The Washington Times recently did an article in which it stated that the technology available to create an Orwellian society is to pass that of George Orwell of 1984 by light years.
[01:27:56.015 --> 01:28:02.879]  We got the European Union and the US government double-teaming to bring us this biometric passport.
[01:28:03.399 --> 01:28:14.785]  The original rhetoric was that Homeland Security's demand that all travellers to the US have a biometric passport was being opposed by the EU because it violated European privacy laws.
[01:28:15.720 --> 01:28:20.056]  What actually happened, as was reported in the Financial Times, is that the EU said
[01:28:20.800 --> 01:28:21.540]  Oh, that's okay.
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:23.481]  We'll just break our own laws.
[01:28:23.681 --> 01:28:27.203]  And so this biometric passport can get the fast track.
[01:28:28.043 --> 01:28:31.905]  And meanwhile, the Queen says in her speech, setting the agenda, you're going to these IDs.
[01:28:32.605 --> 01:28:39.728]  Also, they've announced in your news, if there's any type of problem, they're going to have martial law and put you in rest and relocation centers to use that term.
[01:28:39.748 --> 01:28:40.749]  There's lots of discussion.
[01:28:41.809 --> 01:28:45.711]  There's Times of London headlines, London Guardian headlines.
[01:28:46.651 --> 01:28:50.954]  Sunday Herald headlines where Tony Blair says he'll ban all dissent.
[01:28:50.994 --> 01:28:52.816]  I mean, these are headlines in your papers!
[01:28:53.516 --> 01:28:59.381]  But they've assured us that they will appoint a judge, you know, appointed by them to oversee that this isn't abuse.
[01:28:59.861 --> 01:29:01.642]  So we can feel safe by that.
[01:29:02.023 --> 01:29:02.863]  So we can feel safe.
[01:29:02.923 --> 01:29:05.965]  I want to take calls when we get back and also get more into this Kokomo hum.
[01:29:06.766 --> 01:29:10.028]  And I want to get into this other article here about Guantanamo.
[01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:12.570]  We're on the march.
[01:29:13.051 --> 01:29:14.552]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:15.568 --> 01:29:18.254]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:21.849 --> 01:29:26.510]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first-ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.

[01:30:17.788 --> 01:30:18.029]  P.O.
[01:30:18.069 --> 01:30:19.811]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[01:30:23.576 --> 01:30:28.582]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[01:30:28.983 --> 01:30:30.204]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[01:30:32.165 --> 01:30:33.605]  Late summer 2001?
[01:30:33.945 --> 01:30:35.025]  You heard the same thing.
[01:30:35.406 --> 01:30:42.547]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in a 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[01:30:43.047 --> 01:30:43.947]  That's recovery?
[01:30:44.567 --> 01:30:49.748]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[01:30:50.168 --> 01:30:51.748]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[01:30:52.408 --> 01:30:55.169]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[01:30:59.850 --> 01:31:01.410]  I love the sound of real money.
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:07.184]  Call your representative today at Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:31:07.605 --> 01:31:12.189]  Learn how to protect your assets with real wealth, not potentially worthless paper.
[01:31:12.569 --> 01:31:13.390]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[01:31:13.450 --> 01:31:13.630]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:31:21.235 --> 01:31:22.556]  Hey Doris, great news!
[01:31:22.816 --> 01:31:27.060]  I now own my own home, free and clear, and I did it in less than five months.
[01:31:27.180 --> 01:31:28.541]  Did you receive an inheritance?
[01:31:28.701 --> 01:31:29.162]  Well, no.
[01:31:29.322 --> 01:31:34.026]  Actually, I found a way to eliminate my mortgage without bankruptcy and without the need of going to court.
[01:31:34.166 --> 01:31:37.429]  And you too can do this legally, lawfully, ethically, and morally.
[01:31:37.509 --> 01:31:39.931]  But Jim, I signed a note promising to pay back the loan.
[01:31:40.071 --> 01:31:42.053]  Isn't it wrong even if I could discharge the loan?
[01:31:42.313 --> 01:31:47.161]  Doris, I felt the same way until I took the time to learn the truth about money and banking.
[01:31:47.281 --> 01:31:51.167]  The most shocking thing I learned is the fact that no real money is ever loaned out.
[01:31:51.307 --> 01:31:53.991]  There's a dirty secret that the banks don't want you to know.
[01:31:54.172 --> 01:31:57.637]  And this is the basis of how I was able to discharge my own mortgage.
[01:31:57.917 --> 01:32:00.840]  I know this is hard to believe, but go to the website to learn more.
[01:32:00.980 --> 01:32:08.366]  Doris, get your pin and find out how many Americans are finding financial freedom by having their mortgages eliminated in less than five months.
[01:32:08.586 --> 01:32:13.210]  Go to www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[01:32:13.330 --> 01:32:15.752]  Just the way it sounds, and there's an S after mortgage.
[01:32:15.952 --> 01:32:20.636]  It's www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[01:32:41.673 --> 01:32:43.615]  Alright, so we got loaded phones here.
[01:32:43.635 --> 01:32:45.156]  Your calls are coming up in a few minutes.
[01:32:45.176 --> 01:32:46.777]  We're talking to Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:32:46.797 --> 01:32:49.700]  Paul, before we go to the calls and get into some more of this news,
[01:32:51.098 --> 01:32:58.060]  For listeners that just joined us, your new book that I published is Order Out of Chaos Elite Sponsored Terror and the New World Order.
[01:32:59.320 --> 01:33:12.564]  It is an extremely impressive, well thought out, just very well documented, a easy read because it's in succinct focused chapters over three hundred and thirty something pages long.
[01:33:12.804 --> 01:33:16.925]  Fifty plus diagrams, documents, photos, screenshots of news articles.
[01:33:18.112 --> 01:33:21.913]  So it's good for somebody that knows nothing about the new world order, nothing about real reality.
[01:33:23.293 --> 01:33:25.754]  They can see the news articles as they're reading about them.
[01:33:26.754 --> 01:33:27.534]  Great book.
[01:33:28.494 --> 01:33:28.614]  It's $19.95.
[01:33:28.874 --> 01:33:35.136]  We've got a second copy for $11.95 to give as a gift, a present, the gift of information.
[01:33:35.936 --> 01:33:44.558]  And of course it also supports the great work that Paul's doing, working 10-15 hours a day there on PrisonPlanet.com and doing a wonderful job.
[01:33:46.047 --> 01:33:49.745]  So please go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get...
[01:33:50.914 --> 01:33:53.515]  Ordered Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror and the New World Order.
[01:33:53.555 --> 01:33:59.698]  You can also call toll-free at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:00.038 --> 01:34:01.539]  This is a very important book.
[01:34:01.579 --> 01:34:04.320]  The best I've read on the subject of government-sponsored terror.
[01:34:04.340 --> 01:34:09.262]  9-11, MI5, MI6 involved in terror.
[01:34:10.643 --> 01:34:15.705]  Major Israeli newspapers admitting that Israel blows stuff up and blames it on people.
[01:34:15.765 --> 01:34:17.046]  I mean, that's out of Haratzin.
[01:34:17.626 --> 01:34:18.307]  It's an amazing book.
[01:34:18.347 --> 01:34:19.648]  You need to have it, folks.
[01:34:19.708 --> 01:34:20.809]  And it deserves to be read.
[01:34:20.829 --> 01:34:21.470]  It needs to be seen.
[01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:24.773]  This type of work won't get legs, won't be read, won't be seen unless you take action.
[01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:41.915]  We want to be a distributor for any of my videos or books or tapes.
[01:34:42.255 --> 01:34:43.737]  You can call our office at 512-291-5750.
[01:34:43.757 --> 01:34:43.797]  512-291-5750.
[01:34:51.693 --> 01:34:56.697]  And that's just a number if you want to be a distributor, or a number if you have a question about your order or something.
[01:34:57.038 --> 01:35:16.274]  The toll-free number just for normal retail sales, if you want any of my videos, the new one, Matrix of Evil with Ron Paul, Cynthia McKinney, Colonel Craig Roberts, myself, Frank Morales, an amazing new film, Matrix of Evil, or Police State 3 Total Enslavement, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, when we snuck in Bohemian Grove.
[01:35:18.343 --> 01:35:22.205]  If you just want to, you know, order a couple of these videos, they're $25.95 a piece.
[01:35:22.325 --> 01:35:24.826]  Order three or more, they drop down to $20 a piece.
[01:35:24.906 --> 01:35:27.887]  My new book, Dissent and Tyranny, is only $12, over 200 pages.
[01:35:29.548 --> 01:35:32.809]  You can also go to Infowars.com to do that, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:40.743 --> 01:35:41.904]  Don't procrastinate, folks.
[01:35:41.964 --> 01:35:46.327]  We've found that 90% of those that see these videos, that read these books, are waking up.
[01:35:46.927 --> 01:35:46.327]  90%.
[01:35:47.307 --> 01:35:49.068]  You've heard the feedback from the listeners.
[01:35:49.088 --> 01:35:49.829]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:49.849 --> 01:35:53.912]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:35:54.212 --> 01:36:00.196]  Paul, before we go to these calls, do you have any notes of encouragement for folks to get the book or the films?
[01:36:11.198 --> 01:36:27.928]  Yeah, well I mean the latest film, Matrix of Evil, obviously goes off on a tangent from some of the others because it actually centers around public speaks and so forth and a lot of people, I mean we've got a poll running on the website and a lot of people think that it's a refreshing change from the others, so another reason to get it.
[01:36:29.770 --> 01:36:30.870]  Oh yeah, I saw that poll.
[01:36:30.931 --> 01:36:31.931]  What's that running now?
[01:36:32.231 --> 01:36:46.177]  Last time I saw it, the vast majority like it because it's not just video clips and news articles of myself, it's two different congress people, it's documents, it's news clips, but it's also speeches.
[01:36:49.910 --> 01:37:03.077]  The two top options that are getting the most votes are that it is a good video because it's refreshing change and the other vote is that it's your best video ever so people seem to be really appreciating it.
[01:37:05.051 --> 01:37:09.412]  Now, I saw the votes a few days ago when there was just a few hundred votes on it.
[01:37:09.452 --> 01:37:12.632]  I think it was 90 plus percent think it's great.
[01:37:13.072 --> 01:37:14.773]  I think there was like three or four votes that hate it.
[01:37:14.793 --> 01:37:16.853]  Of course, guarantee those people didn't buy it.
[01:37:16.873 --> 01:37:17.893]  It's just some detractor.
[01:37:19.294 --> 01:37:23.254]  But, I mean, just because it's standard operating procedure.
[01:37:24.094 --> 01:37:27.695]  But, again, I love those polls you do on the website.
[01:37:27.715 --> 01:37:30.976]  You've got all types of great questions that you ask people.
[01:37:33.635 --> 01:37:37.097]  We're going to take these calls real quick, and then I want to get back into the persistent hum.
[01:37:37.157 --> 01:37:40.779]  I want to get into Dean Bush may have tipped to 9-11 attacks.
[01:37:41.379 --> 01:37:41.680]  U.S.
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.701]  fires Guantanamo defense team.
[01:37:44.921 --> 01:37:50.364]  Also, they're not getting rid of Kyoto, but on the surface, they say that they're doing that.
[01:37:50.685 --> 01:37:54.367]  But something I want to cover right now before we go to these calls, and I promise them we're going to your calls, folks.
[01:37:55.867 --> 01:37:58.489]  I've talked a lot about, Paul, this phony left-right paradigm.
[01:38:00.454 --> 01:38:06.337]  I've seen white papers three, four, five years ago where the globalists were saying, well, the people know there's world government now.
[01:38:06.377 --> 01:38:08.398]  We can't continue to deny that there's a world government.
[01:38:09.498 --> 01:38:21.723]  So what we've got to do is say there's a left-wing EU, UN world government that's against war and for socialism, and there'll be the evil right-wing Americans, when in truth they're all on the same team, working together publicly.
[01:38:22.483 --> 01:38:28.765]  Going for the real same agenda, just different rhetoric, now Mugabe envisions alternative world order headed by China.
[01:38:29.066 --> 01:38:37.769]  CNS News, the current world order is unjust and unsustainable and needs an alternative headed by a communist China, according to Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe.
[01:38:38.385 --> 01:38:54.455]  The State of the Nation Address delivered in the Capitol, the 79-year-old leader of the impoverished South, Southern African country, criticized what he called the interlateral interference in the international, internal political affairs of the countries, especially smaller states, by powerful nations.
[01:38:55.037 --> 01:39:02.883]  Through the reference, was to Zimbabwe itself, which is subjected to sanctions because of Mugabe's controversial policies, he also cited the situation in Iraq.
[01:39:03.364 --> 01:39:12.611]  Recent events in Iraq have clearly shown that the unipolar world, presently governmental, international in relations, is both unjust and unsustainable, he said.
[01:39:12.631 --> 01:39:21.819]  He says we must have a bipolar world with, they call it the Anglo-Saxon Unholy Alliance,
[01:39:23.164 --> 01:39:28.966]  Again, Zimbabwe, you talked about Britain, Australia, New Zealand, America and others.
[01:39:29.446 --> 01:39:31.566]  And again, that's the Anglo-American establishment.
[01:39:31.826 --> 01:39:40.788]  So here again, all over the world, as I said, third world countries run by thugs, rallying to the UN and the EU and Russia and China as the good loving liberals.
[01:39:41.349 --> 01:39:42.269]  See how this works?
[01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:42.849]  Comments, Paul.
[01:39:43.675 --> 01:39:47.880]  Well, yeah, I mean, a lot of it is just criminals jockeying for power, basically.
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:49.822]  I mean, we know what the situation is in Zimbabwe.
[01:39:49.922 --> 01:39:54.446]  I mean, Mugabe makes his political enemies have sex with their own children.
[01:39:54.506 --> 01:39:58.290]  Then in China, you've got your mobile execution death bans.
[01:39:59.171 --> 01:40:15.830]  As he said, Mugabe's rallying for China to lead the New World Order, when in fact, just today, we've got an article out of AFP which is entitled, Decision to Sell Weapons to China, Stirs Dissent in Germany, and it also talks about how France are arming China.
[01:40:17.096 --> 01:40:25.522]  Mugabe speaking out against, you know, a European or a U.S.-led New World Order is a fallacy when all these countries are arming China in the first place.
[01:40:25.662 --> 01:40:30.725]  And again, this bypasses a debate about we don't want world government, now it's who's going to control it.
[01:40:30.765 --> 01:40:30.985]  See?
[01:40:31.706 --> 01:40:33.007]  They're masters of that, folks.
[01:40:33.047 --> 01:40:34.688]  Well, let's talk to Joe in Colorado.
[01:40:35.208 --> 01:40:35.989]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:40:36.049 --> 01:40:36.409]  Go ahead.
[01:40:36.429 --> 01:40:36.989]  Thanks for holding.
[01:40:39.331 --> 01:40:39.531]  Hello?
[01:40:40.011 --> 01:40:40.412]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:40.512 --> 01:40:40.932]  Oh, it's Jay.
[01:40:41.753 --> 01:40:42.893]  I'm sorry, Jay.
[01:40:42.933 --> 01:40:43.513]  Go ahead.
[01:40:43.533 --> 01:40:44.734]  I wasn't sure if you were talking to me.
[01:40:44.754 --> 01:40:45.514]  That's alright.
[01:40:45.554 --> 01:40:46.194]  Hey, go ahead.
[01:40:46.314 --> 01:40:51.895]  Well, first, I just want to thank you and Paul for all your work and getting this stuff out.
[01:40:51.975 --> 01:41:03.698]  Second, I just wanted to know what you think we should do if they do drop the hammer, whether it be bio or some fake attack or any other emergency, quote unquote, that meets martial law.
[01:41:04.198 --> 01:41:05.998]  What should we do besides not
[01:41:06.772 --> 01:41:07.312]  Get on the bus.
[01:41:07.352 --> 01:41:08.072]  You know what I mean?
[01:41:08.493 --> 01:41:10.253]  Well, that's a very important question.
[01:41:10.353 --> 01:41:12.854]  Paul, I know you've thought a lot about this.
[01:41:12.874 --> 01:41:13.914]  Would you like to comment first?
[01:41:14.875 --> 01:41:19.516]  Well, obviously the major thing is to be prepared personally.
[01:41:19.596 --> 01:41:22.057]  Potassium iodide, water filters, etc.
[01:41:24.257 --> 01:41:32.380]  Basically, yeah, the main thing is to get the hell out of there because with these new contingency laws which are being passed in England, similar thing in America,
[01:41:32.952 --> 01:41:42.802]  They're going to take an area of quarantine and not allow anyone to leave that area, and that's going to be the case at Ground Zero if they pull off this type of attack.
[01:41:42.842 --> 01:41:48.088]  So, have a route specified to get to a safe place, you know, out in the middle of nowhere.
[01:41:48.368 --> 01:41:51.291]  Yeah, the reason the biological attack... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:41:51.932 --> 01:41:55.394]  Well, a lot of people say, you know, oh, these survivalist wackos.
[01:41:55.474 --> 01:41:56.515]  I mean, it's just common sense.
[01:41:56.575 --> 01:41:58.396]  The government's saying that we're going to be attacked.
[01:41:58.476 --> 01:41:59.216]  We're not saying that.
[01:41:59.276 --> 01:41:59.517]  They are.
[01:41:59.837 --> 01:42:06.301]  And they're building giant bunkers in huge underground cities for the elite and a hundred years of storable food and all of this.
[01:42:06.381 --> 01:42:08.642]  And yeah, storable food, water filters, firearms.
[01:42:08.722 --> 01:42:10.203]  Obviously, you can't have firearms now in your
[01:42:10.903 --> 01:42:11.444]  Uh, country.
[01:42:30.961 --> 01:42:32.522]  99 plus percent refused.
[01:42:32.962 --> 01:42:37.666]  That's really messing them up right now because they're realizing people aren't going to follow their orders.
[01:42:37.926 --> 01:42:38.947]  They may not care though.
[01:42:38.967 --> 01:42:41.689]  They may allow a total breakdown and want that.
[01:42:41.789 --> 01:42:46.733]  And their own policy reports say that to then change our society overnight.
[01:42:46.773 --> 01:42:48.454]  They've lined up the forces to do it.
[01:42:48.534 --> 01:42:49.615]  So, what do you do?
[01:42:50.516 --> 01:42:55.460]  Even if you've got the money to buy one acre in the boonies somewhere, at least 75 miles from a major city,
[01:42:57.136 --> 01:43:03.819]  That has a well or has buried water for at least six months or filters to be able to filter nearby water.
[01:43:03.839 --> 01:43:06.601]  You need storable food for at least a year.
[01:43:06.741 --> 01:43:07.821]  You need to have firearms.
[01:43:07.881 --> 01:43:09.122]  It's just an insurance policy.
[01:43:09.402 --> 01:43:14.764]  Probably cost you three or four thousand dollars, you know, to just have a basic tent and things ready.
[01:43:15.625 --> 01:43:17.245]  Have a place you can bug out to.
[01:43:18.086 --> 01:43:22.528]  Be ready, folks, because they're going to let this, if they do it, they're going to let it degenerate.
[01:43:23.157 --> 01:43:27.701]  They're going to let riots begin like their dark winter program said in 99 before they launched all this.
[01:43:28.562 --> 01:43:31.504]  They're going to let things break down and then come in as our saviors.
[01:43:32.105 --> 01:43:36.449]  And then it'll be report on your neighbors and you get the pass card, the multi-pass.
[01:43:39.284 --> 01:43:41.925]  The government's preparing for all this, and we're not supposed to.
[01:43:41.945 --> 01:43:44.886]  I mean, that's mostly what this Kokomo Hum thing is.
[01:43:44.906 --> 01:43:49.787]  We know they've got the deep underground boring machines that bore all these tunnels.
[01:43:49.847 --> 01:44:07.573]  I mean, that's how the Channel Tunnel was created, and we've got this network... And a lot of people, a lot of scientists, mainstream scientists, have said it's not ultra-low frequency weapons or tests, that they've proven that these giant underground locomotives that can do, like, how many feet a minute, that these things send off a harmonic that makes people very ill.
[01:44:09.548 --> 01:44:13.111]  I have family and friends back in New York.
[01:44:13.151 --> 01:44:16.794]  I live out here pretty much by myself in that regard.
[01:44:17.194 --> 01:44:20.277]  I tell people to meet me in Canada, but I don't see that being any place to go.
[01:44:20.737 --> 01:44:21.778]  Sure, that's why I was saying, like,
[01:44:27.304 --> 01:44:31.005]  Well, is there a place or a certain... I mean, Canada will arrest you.
[01:44:31.085 --> 01:44:35.226]  Canada will arrest you if you believe Earth is run by space aliens.
[01:44:35.266 --> 01:44:41.027]  I mean, you know, they even... I mean, if you say anything unorthodox, you're arrested in Canada.
[01:44:41.147 --> 01:44:42.388]  Yeah, I usually say it tongue-in-cheek.
[01:44:42.428 --> 01:44:46.369]  I guess that goes back to the Vietnam, everybody going to Canada kind of thing in my head.
[01:44:46.789 --> 01:44:49.209]  But not that I would know from first hand.
[01:44:49.229 --> 01:44:49.890]  I'm only 29.
[01:44:50.130 --> 01:44:53.270]  Well, that's why they signed a NORTHCOM pact.
[01:44:53.530 --> 01:44:55.491]  We're going to have Canadian and Mexican soldiers here.
[01:44:56.744 --> 01:45:02.028]  Is there a place that people can get gas masks and stuff like that that actually work?
[01:45:02.048 --> 01:45:06.190]  I was in the military, not the ones they have because they don't work.
[01:45:06.210 --> 01:45:09.112]  You need to do your own study on that.
[01:45:09.953 --> 01:45:14.296]  Again, they may just cause martial law and breakdown in one corridor of the country
[01:45:15.251 --> 01:45:27.804]  And then East Coast, West Coast, wherever, wherever people are less self-sufficient, they tend to do it where they've got more domesticated populations, more compact populations, and then use that as a demonstration for martial law everywhere.
[01:45:28.745 --> 01:45:37.854]  And then about five years after they have that next phase, then they'll have a real plague released, some super weapon, not just some, you know, smallpox that really only kills about 10% of people.
[01:45:39.355 --> 01:45:43.337]  And then that's when the real crisis begins.
[01:45:43.437 --> 01:45:44.878]  This is done by stepping things up.
[01:45:45.118 --> 01:45:45.958]  Thanks for the call, Joe.
[01:45:47.019 --> 01:45:47.999]  Mark, who's up next?
[01:45:48.019 --> 01:45:49.580]  Who should I go to next?
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:52.461]  Mike in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:45:54.562 --> 01:45:54.922]  Okay.
[01:45:56.903 --> 01:45:57.843]  Alright, Mike, you there?
[01:45:58.163 --> 01:45:58.423]  Hello.
[01:45:58.743 --> 01:45:59.404]  Yes, welcome.
[01:45:59.944 --> 01:46:04.426]  Yes, I just wanted to talk about, when you talk about bio warfare,
[01:46:05.998 --> 01:46:08.800]  I don't see too much of it in the media and it's been out for a while.
[01:46:12.403 --> 01:46:19.228]  I'm more concerned about the microwave weapons that people can get a hold of, that the terrorists can get a hold of.
[01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:23.211]  And who are the terrorists?
[01:46:23.271 --> 01:46:27.814]  I've never found a major terrorist event that wasn't a western intelligence agency.
[01:46:29.602 --> 01:46:32.264]  Or anybody who wants to just create normal harm to you.
[01:46:32.304 --> 01:46:39.451]  Well, according to ABC News, they've deployed Humvees with a giant microwave gun that could be focused down to killing you or just burning your skin.
[01:46:39.931 --> 01:46:51.261]  According to the Sunshine Project, they've got mounted helicopters with opiate knockout gases, exactly the same type that were used by the Russians in the Moscow theater that killed fully one-third of those inside.
[01:46:51.941 --> 01:46:57.624]  And I've witnessed Marines training to use sound wave guns to knock you and your family out and put you in prison camp buses.
[01:46:58.244 --> 01:46:59.304]  That is in Police State 2000.
[01:46:59.344 --> 01:47:01.085]  Paul Watson comments.
[01:47:01.725 --> 01:47:10.009]  Well, yeah, it's definitely focusing down on this biological aspect because we've got the worldwide death of the top race-specific researchers.
[01:47:10.049 --> 01:47:18.793]  So, I mean, I think that's the ultimate goal is to release one of these race-specific bioweapons and then create, you know, ultimate bedlam, basically.
[01:47:18.813 --> 01:47:21.294]  All right.
[01:47:22.798 --> 01:47:32.488]  I had another item about what happens if your work wants to block InfoWars or PrisonPlanet.com and those are news access.
[01:47:37.725 --> 01:47:43.269]  What companies do is they share databases now that ban anything that's a gun site, even the NRA.
[01:47:43.769 --> 01:47:47.912]  They ban any pro-life sites, and they list them as terrorism in the indexes.
[01:47:47.952 --> 01:47:51.434]  There's terror, there's hacking, there's porn, there's gambling.
[01:47:51.774 --> 01:47:59.920]  And even at the colleges, do you mean they can even block, you maybe get through on the radio waves.
[01:48:05.917 --> 01:48:08.598]  Well, you need to have your student group protest that.
[01:48:08.978 --> 01:48:10.278]  Go start your own student group.
[01:48:10.359 --> 01:48:16.440]  Go to the technology department that maintenances that and demand that the censorship stop.
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:19.841]  I mean, what's on InfoWars today but the New York Times and stuff?
[01:48:19.901 --> 01:48:20.862]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:48:21.102 --> 01:48:25.323]  They just don't like us all putting it in one spot so you can see it all together.
[01:48:26.123 --> 01:48:28.784]  So you're at, what university are you attending?
[01:48:30.425 --> 01:48:31.165]  I did go to UTD.
[01:48:32.436 --> 01:48:33.817]  University of Texas, the Dallas.
[01:48:34.418 --> 01:48:36.759]  And you're saying that Infowars.com is blocked?
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:38.641]  Well, I don't know about that, UTD.
[01:48:39.021 --> 01:48:41.183]  I haven't actually used their computers in a while.
[01:48:41.203 --> 01:48:42.584]  So, sir, are you saying it's been blocked?
[01:48:42.724 --> 01:48:55.193]  But it's been blocked at work, and we can't use, even, we can look at, like, CNN and Fox, but we're not allowed to look at anything that's degraded the government in any way.
[01:48:55.213 --> 01:48:56.554]  Yeah, sounds like a free country.
[01:48:56.594 --> 01:48:57.195]  Where do you work?
[01:48:58.956 --> 01:49:01.418]  Let's just say it's a major communications company.
[01:49:02.802 --> 01:49:04.202]  So you work for Southwestern Bell?
[01:49:04.222 --> 01:49:06.583]  I don't want to say that.
[01:49:08.764 --> 01:49:09.144]  All right.
[01:49:09.424 --> 01:49:10.545]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[01:49:10.705 --> 01:49:11.365]  Thank you.
[01:49:11.385 --> 01:49:12.345]  Good to hear from you there.
[01:49:12.765 --> 01:49:18.847]  Let's talk to... Who in New York?
[01:49:19.988 --> 01:49:21.028]  Lee Zahn in New York.
[01:49:21.068 --> 01:49:21.588]  You're on the air.
[01:49:21.628 --> 01:49:22.028]  Go ahead.
[01:49:23.029 --> 01:49:23.369]  Hi.
[01:49:23.889 --> 01:49:24.029]  Yes.
[01:49:24.049 --> 01:49:24.709]  Can you hear me?
[01:49:24.849 --> 01:49:25.569]  Yes, I can.
[01:49:25.909 --> 01:49:26.250]  Okay.
[01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:27.390]  I'm very nervous.
[01:49:27.570 --> 01:49:28.670]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:49:28.770 --> 01:49:30.551]  I've been listening to you for about six months.
[01:49:31.738 --> 01:49:33.579]  And reading everything I can get my hands on.
[01:49:33.599 --> 01:49:35.940]  And I'm also a Christian.
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:38.241]  And I'm scared to death.
[01:49:39.381 --> 01:49:47.944]  Because I... When we first had the attack on September 11th, 2001, it was like instinct.
[01:49:50.705 --> 01:49:52.986]  I just knew.
[01:49:53.006 --> 01:49:57.728]  I knew beyond any doubt that this was something that would create
[01:49:59.461 --> 01:50:04.346]  Well, you know, I hate to use the word conspiracy, but it just was like I knew.
[01:50:04.526 --> 01:50:08.230]  Well, the police charge people... And all of a sudden, everything became confirmed by all these news sources.
[01:50:08.250 --> 01:50:09.111]  Ma'am, we've got a break.
[01:50:09.171 --> 01:50:10.092]  Stay there, okay?
[01:50:10.732 --> 01:50:11.853]  We'll put you on hold.
[01:50:12.174 --> 01:50:12.534]  Stay there.
[01:50:12.754 --> 01:50:13.475]  We'll come back to you.
[01:50:14.556 --> 01:50:18.099]  The police charge people every day with conspiracy, but governments don't do it?
[01:50:18.200 --> 01:50:18.380]  Hmm.
[01:50:21.553 --> 01:50:25.878]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:26.078 --> 01:50:30.482]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:30.643 --> 01:50:35.027]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:35.067 --> 01:50:36.409]  The New World Order.
[01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:38.551]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:51.926 --> 01:51:02.250]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:02.530 --> 01:51:07.893]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:51:08.413 --> 01:51:12.334]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:51:12.354 --> 01:51:12.634]  That's 888.
[01:51:17.016 --> 01:51:26.878]  I can't believe I got these drugs prescribed for free and shipped overnight to my door without seeing a doctor.
[01:51:27.038 --> 01:51:27.638]  Yes, it's true.
[01:51:27.658 --> 01:51:30.419]  For a limited time, our doctors are prescribing drugs for free.
[01:51:30.559 --> 01:51:34.540]  Our doctors are prescribing the most popular diet pills, muscle relaxers, sleeping pills, and Viagra.
[01:51:34.620 --> 01:51:35.220]  You heard it right.
[01:51:35.340 --> 01:51:40.321]  Free prescriptions over the phone for painkillers, migraine relief, anti-anxiety, allergy relief, and heartburn relief.
[01:51:40.421 --> 01:51:41.441]  The list goes on and on.
[01:51:41.701 --> 01:51:45.747]  Free prescriptions for hair loss, birth control, antidepressants, acne creams, and herpes medication.
[01:51:45.847 --> 01:51:47.950]  Did I mention free diet pills and Viagra prescriptions?
[01:51:48.150 --> 01:51:49.352]  This is a limited time offer.
[01:51:49.452 --> 01:51:53.738]  Our doctors will not be prescribing drugs over the phone for free and shipping them overnight to your door for much longer.
[01:51:53.899 --> 01:51:55.721]  If you don't call 1-800-615-7094 right now, you may miss out forever.
[01:51:58.285 --> 01:52:02.810]  However, to participate in this limited time offer and have your drugs prescribed over the phone for free, you need to call 1-800-615-7094 now.
[01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:06.394]  That's 1-800-615-7094 for drugs like Phentermine, Ambien, Fioriset, Sama, Ultram, Viagra, and many more.
[01:52:06.414 --> 01:52:07.975]  Call 1-800-615-7094 now before it's too late.
[01:52:07.995 --> 01:52:08.896]  1-800-615-7094 for free prescriptions.
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:24.021]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:52:24.081 --> 01:52:28.242]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:52:28.502 --> 01:52:31.302]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:52:31.482 --> 01:52:33.883]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:52:34.083 --> 01:52:42.725]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:52:42.905 --> 01:52:44.265]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:52:44.445 --> 01:52:48.706]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:52:48.866 --> 01:52:49.386]  We're good to go!
[01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:10.122]  Alright, folks.
[01:53:10.262 --> 01:53:11.743]  Let's go back to Lisan and New York.
[01:53:38.411 --> 01:53:42.713]  Uh, ma'am, you had a question we ran into the last break, or you had a comment.
[01:53:42.733 --> 01:53:43.114]  Go ahead.
[01:53:46.435 --> 01:53:47.616]  Go ahead, ma'am, if you're there.
[01:53:47.636 --> 01:53:49.337]  Oh, okay.
[01:53:49.377 --> 01:53:50.337]  Hey, no problem.
[01:53:50.617 --> 01:53:51.458]  I told her to hold on.
[01:53:51.518 --> 01:53:52.278]  I figured she wouldn't.
[01:53:52.318 --> 01:53:52.818]  People don't.
[01:53:53.339 --> 01:53:54.299]  Sorn in Minnesota.
[01:53:54.960 --> 01:53:56.020]  Uh, Sorn, you're on the air.
[01:53:56.060 --> 01:53:56.480]  Go ahead.
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:57.621]  Hey, Alex.
[01:53:58.341 --> 01:53:58.841]  How you doing?
[01:53:59.002 --> 01:54:01.903]  I just had a couple quick questions for you and Paul Watson.
[01:54:02.143 --> 01:54:02.823]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:54:02.843 --> 01:54:04.184]  Especially the first one for Paul.
[01:54:04.224 --> 01:54:05.685]  I remember back in your radio show,
[01:54:06.739 --> 01:54:12.924]  You had an ad you played during a commercial and it was the NWO music and George Bush doing audio over that.
[01:54:13.605 --> 01:54:15.046]  I've been trying to find that everywhere.
[01:54:15.066 --> 01:54:16.867]  I was wondering if you could tell me where you found that?
[01:54:18.489 --> 01:54:24.293]  Well, a lot of those are being produced where you get a State of the Union address and cut it up and play it over some music.
[01:54:24.313 --> 01:54:27.476]  So obviously it sounds like Bush is publicly announcing a New World Order.
[01:54:28.377 --> 01:54:30.859]  I'll try and retrieve it and post it on the website.
[01:54:30.879 --> 01:54:35.783]  I remember he was talking about the country in terms of death and murder.
[01:54:36.917 --> 01:54:39.518]  I thought it was really cool, I'm just trying to find it for a long time.
[01:54:40.459 --> 01:54:42.640]  Yeah, we have to remember that it is satire though.
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:47.323]  He didn't really say it, but you know, it gives an example of what his agenda really is.
[01:54:47.363 --> 01:54:48.924]  Yes, I understand that, but yeah.
[01:54:48.944 --> 01:54:50.505]  Because I'm working on a website too.
[01:54:50.565 --> 01:54:51.905]  Yeah, I stay away from stuff like that.
[01:54:53.366 --> 01:54:58.629]  I mean, it's funny, it's interesting, it's scary, but I don't... I just stick with what they're actually saying and doing.
[01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:05.813]  But... And also, this morning I was digging through the Propaganda Matrix archives and some
[01:55:12.279 --> 01:55:13.681]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[01:55:13.841 --> 01:55:19.309]  He's talking about how Israel may nuke Iran and this whole escalation after England and the U.S.
[01:55:19.349 --> 01:55:20.911]  and Israel armed Iran.
[01:55:20.951 --> 01:55:21.752]  Comments to that, Paul?
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:38.968]  And Israel publicly stated that they plan to invade Syria and now we've got a story which is getting no airplay on the big networks which is the fact that China have got 500 ballistic missiles aimed at Taiwan and are saying that they don't care how many casualties will occur.
[01:55:39.508 --> 01:55:45.572]  And basically the US is abandoning Taiwan at the moment and everyone's arming China and so that's getting no attention.
[01:55:46.394 --> 01:55:50.056]  Any touchpoint can be the catalyst for this meltdown.
[01:55:50.256 --> 01:55:55.579]  Yeah, the great conservative Bush administration following suit with Clinton, arming China and North Korea.
[01:55:56.379 --> 01:56:04.104]  We've got on the board of directors of ABB, Rumsfeld continuing the arming of North Korea, and they tell you to give up your liberties for security.
[01:56:04.164 --> 01:56:05.044]  It's ridiculous.
[01:56:07.506 --> 01:56:09.106]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[01:56:10.959 --> 01:56:12.805]  Paul, what do you see happening in the next year?
[01:56:12.846 --> 01:56:14.431]  When do you think the next terror attack is coming?
[01:56:14.471 --> 01:56:15.595]  Before or after the election?
[01:56:15.916 --> 01:56:17.541]  The next big one here in the West.
[01:56:19.132 --> 01:56:21.453]  It depends on which puppet they put in there.
[01:56:21.493 --> 01:56:26.796]  I mean, basically a lot of people can't pick between Bush and Wesley Clarke or Kerry.
[01:56:26.856 --> 01:56:28.697]  I mean, you've got Kerry and Bush, skull and bones.
[01:56:28.717 --> 01:56:32.599]  You've got Wesley Clarke who oversaw the Waco massacre, so it's a great choice.
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:41.744]  Probably just after the election, and we did run a poll on that as well, and the consensus is that it will basically take place a few months after the election.
[01:56:42.685 --> 01:56:46.367]  Yeah, that's what I'm getting, and again, we can't ever guess exactly what they'll do.
[01:56:47.250 --> 01:56:52.634]  I had enough indicators before 9-11 to see that was coming because of the preparatory news reports about we're about to get hit.
[01:56:52.694 --> 01:56:54.375]  You give your rights up when that happens.
[01:56:54.595 --> 01:56:56.656]  We're about to get hit very soon.
[01:56:57.056 --> 01:56:58.237]  Here's Bin Laden.
[01:56:58.717 --> 01:56:59.678]  Here he is.
[01:56:59.738 --> 01:57:00.459]  Here's his face.
[01:57:00.519 --> 01:57:01.099]  Remember him.
[01:57:01.179 --> 01:57:02.060]  He's the bad man.
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:03.500]  He's going to do it.
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:08.964]  And that's exactly what's happening in London where they're hyping this bio attack all the time.
[01:57:09.426 --> 01:57:16.739]  Arresting people in local villages to create this perception that terrorists are running around in our backyards, which of course creates fear.
[01:57:16.759 --> 01:57:19.063]  And they're doing that right here in Texas saying it's right wingers.
[01:57:19.926 --> 01:57:22.808]  Do five more minutes with us, Paul, then we got some guests coming up.
[01:57:22.868 --> 01:57:29.011]  One of the victim's wives is suing Bush for treason with her lawyer and her open letter.
[01:57:29.712 --> 01:57:31.533]  That's coming up here in about ten minutes or so.
[01:57:31.913 --> 01:57:32.534]  So stay with us.
[01:57:32.754 --> 01:57:36.236]  Next hour coming up, folks, remember, I'll be in Houston December 13th.
[01:57:36.696 --> 01:57:42.880]  That's two Saturdays from now, showing Road to Tyranny, and they live on the big screen at the West Oak Shopping Center.
[01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:46.542]  That's December 13th in Houston, Texas.
[01:57:46.642 --> 01:57:47.902]  Please bring your friends and family.
[01:57:48.262 --> 01:57:49.223]  Great place to network.
[01:57:49.263 --> 01:57:52.244]  You can buy your tickets ahead of time at Infowars.com.
[01:57:52.264 --> 01:57:53.285]  Link through to the movie theater.
[01:57:53.805 --> 01:57:56.886]  And I hope to see everybody there in Houston again.
[01:57:57.427 --> 01:57:58.827]  It was a great success last time.
[01:57:58.867 --> 01:58:00.908]  December 13th, Houston, Texas.
[01:58:00.928 --> 01:58:02.649]  6 to 11.30 p.m.
[01:58:02.769 --> 01:58:03.149]  at night.
[01:58:03.749 --> 01:58:07.491]  So I'll see you in Houston in about a week and a half on that Saturday.
[01:58:07.611 --> 01:58:09.092]  We'll be right back with 3rd Hour.
[01:58:11.693 --> 01:58:13.274]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.654 --> 01:58:19.396]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:58:19.416 --> 01:58:29.781]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from water... You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:36.984 --> 01:58:37.644]  Big Brother.
[01:58:38.305 --> 01:58:39.265]  Mainstream Media.
[01:58:40.058 --> 01:58:41.158]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:41.798 --> 01:58:42.619]  You want answers?
[01:58:43.399 --> 01:58:45.319]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:45.339 --> 01:58:48.580]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:53.241]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:57.602 --> 01:59:02.003]  We've got Ellen Morinari coming on the show.
[01:59:03.943 --> 01:59:06.264]  And we've got her lawyer, Philip J. Berg.
[01:59:09.292 --> 01:59:14.475]  9-1-1 victim's wife plans to fight for her late husband's honor by taking on the U.S.
[01:59:14.535 --> 01:59:14.956]  government.
[01:59:14.976 --> 01:59:17.277]  9-11 in Neverland.
[01:59:17.337 --> 01:59:19.839]  Press ignores Widow's Bush treason lawsuit.
[01:59:19.879 --> 01:59:26.763]  We read her letter two days ago on the show where she comes right out with it and says that the government had prior knowledge, was behind it.
[01:59:27.603 --> 01:59:28.144]  All of this.
[01:59:28.964 --> 01:59:31.206]  That is coming up in the next segment.
[01:59:31.226 --> 01:59:35.148]  Our final segment with Paul Joseph Watson of PrisonPlanet.com, my webmaster there.
[01:59:35.628 --> 01:59:38.170]  Author of Order Out of Chaos, elite sponsor of Terror and the New World Order.
[01:59:39.893 --> 01:59:43.415]  And let's go ahead and talk to Wesley in Tennessee.
[01:59:43.475 --> 01:59:44.576]  Wesley, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:59:44.596 --> 01:59:46.737]  Hi Alex.
[01:59:47.257 --> 02:00:08.870]  I just wanted to say that absolutely every single word, and I mean every single word that you said about the reborn Roman Empire, aka the EU, is supported in the book of Daniel, where Daniel gives that prophecy to King
[02:00:09.611 --> 02:00:10.391]  Never could answer.
[02:00:11.092 --> 02:00:17.234]  So, I mean, there isn't a single thing that you said that is not backed up by that book of the Bible.
[02:00:17.835 --> 02:00:19.215]  I just thought you should know that.
[02:00:20.996 --> 02:00:21.716]  Well, it is.
[02:00:21.836 --> 02:00:23.697]  There are frightening parallels there.
[02:00:23.777 --> 02:00:24.357]  Paul Watson?
[02:00:25.698 --> 02:00:26.078]  Well, yeah.
[02:00:26.118 --> 02:00:34.302]  I mean, the micromanagement aspect of the European Union is what's coming to America with the UN and the Pan-American Union.
[02:00:34.522 --> 02:00:35.182]  I mean, we've got
[02:00:36.088 --> 02:00:43.193]  The EU telling farmers that they have to play with their pigs for a certain amount of time every day, otherwise they get their farm taken away from them.
[02:00:43.213 --> 02:00:46.034]  And it's just training them to do ridiculous things under orders?
[02:00:46.795 --> 02:00:55.320]  Yeah, we've got swings in children's parks where the EU say that they have to be a certain diameter to be safe.
[02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:58.482]  And they're banning yogurt in certain areas?
[02:00:58.502 --> 02:00:59.643]  They're banning most vitamins?
[02:01:00.600 --> 02:01:05.853]  Yeah, they basically said that yoghurt has to be called fermented milk product.
[02:01:06.747 --> 02:01:08.148]  It's just completely out of control.
[02:01:08.168 --> 02:01:10.409]  I mean, you know, the vitamin sales are clamped down.
[02:01:10.509 --> 02:01:12.470]  Vitamin C, selenium, everything.
[02:01:12.490 --> 02:01:14.871]  They're just saying that it's not going to be available.
[02:01:14.891 --> 02:01:15.891]  It's going to be outlawed.
[02:01:16.251 --> 02:01:24.195]  We've got them banning smoking in all pubs with, obviously, bars, which is another... I mean, whether you agree with smoking or not, it's your right to do it.
[02:01:24.235 --> 02:01:26.296]  And I mean, that's what bars are for, basically.
[02:01:26.336 --> 02:01:31.319]  And they're saying that they're even going to ban smoking in public as well, which has already happened in New York.
[02:01:31.359 --> 02:01:36.381]  And so every facet of ludicrous micromanagement, and the EU were involved in it.
[02:01:37.040 --> 02:01:38.002]  And it's all out of U.N.
[02:01:38.042 --> 02:01:40.265]  treaties, just like it is here, being merged.
[02:01:40.325 --> 02:01:42.349]  Wesley, thanks for the call.
[02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:48.458]  Paul Watson, they've got Dean out saying, well, Bush is covering up something on 9-11.
[02:01:48.478 --> 02:01:50.281]  That makes it a left-right argument.
[02:01:50.301 --> 02:01:51.183]  What do you think about that?
[02:01:52.285 --> 02:01:57.508]  Obviously Dean went to Yale and is intimately involved with the skull and bones crowd.
[02:01:57.888 --> 02:02:00.089]  The report says it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:02:00.109 --> 02:02:07.354]  Well, the biggest conspiracy theory is on the part of the government that 19 hijackers, 7 or 8 of which are still alive, carried out the attack.
[02:02:08.627 --> 02:02:20.973]  Colonel Don DeGrande who held a 72-hour symposium with top military and civilian pilots who stated that September 11th was a military attack and nobody was on those planes.
[02:02:21.033 --> 02:02:22.434]  It was done by remote control.
[02:02:22.554 --> 02:02:24.615]  And that was with a lot of top officers worldwide.
[02:02:24.955 --> 02:02:25.236]  U.S.
[02:02:25.276 --> 02:02:32.900]  Fires Guantanamo defense team, the lawyers they'd hired from the military to do this said we're not giving them a fair trial so they fired them.
[02:02:32.940 --> 02:02:33.580]  I mean, look at that!
[02:02:34.372 --> 02:02:36.592]  Well, I mean, the bottom line on that is, um, L.A.
[02:02:36.653 --> 02:02:41.394]  Times, August 18, 2002, no leaders of Al-Qaeda found at Guantanamo.
[02:02:41.794 --> 02:02:44.074]  Despite intense interrogations, U.S.
[02:02:44.114 --> 02:02:50.235]  authorities have yet to identify any senior Al-Qaeda leaders among the nearly 600 suspects.
[02:02:50.315 --> 02:02:51.696]  So, I mean, they're all shoemakers.
[02:02:52.116 --> 02:03:00.598]  Whether you differ about how these trials are conducted, the fact is that there are no Al-Qaeda members, if that organization even exists, at Guantanamo Bay.
[02:03:00.998 --> 02:03:02.058]  Alright, Paul Watson?
[02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:07.371]  Thank you for coming on the show today, and I look forward to talking to you again next week.
[02:03:08.371 --> 02:03:12.373]  And keep up the great work there at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:03:12.393 --> 02:03:12.893]  Godspeed.
[02:03:13.693 --> 02:03:14.013]  Okay.
[02:03:14.033 --> 02:03:14.473]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:03:14.813 --> 02:03:15.113]  You bet.
[02:03:15.153 --> 02:03:15.673]  Great job.
[02:03:15.793 --> 02:03:18.774]  We're going to come back with our next guest.
[02:03:19.434 --> 02:03:25.436]  We're valiantly standing up to the cover-ups and the tyranny concerning 9-11, one of the widows and one of the victims, and her lawyer.
[02:03:26.136 --> 02:03:29.077]  On the other side of this break, please stay with us.
[02:03:32.483 --> 02:03:39.328]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:03:39.629 --> 02:03:41.030]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[02:03:41.190 --> 02:03:43.392]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:03:43.552 --> 02:03:45.633]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:03:45.914 --> 02:03:50.857]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11, this is the film for you.
[02:03:51.198 --> 02:03:55.221]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:55.461 --> 02:03:57.242]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:57.322 --> 02:04:07.967]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:04:08.107 --> 02:04:10.008]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:04:10.229 --> 02:04:14.090]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[02:04:14.171 --> 02:04:15.451]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[02:04:19.193 --> 02:04:20.034]  That's 888-253-3139.

[02:04:26.517 --> 02:04:29.759]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:04:31.720 --> 02:04:34.542]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[02:04:34.662 --> 02:04:35.502]  Michael Trudeau here.
[02:04:35.622 --> 02:04:38.924]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[02:04:39.104 --> 02:04:44.787]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[02:04:44.907 --> 02:04:47.929]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[02:04:48.189 --> 02:04:52.475]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:04:52.655 --> 02:04:54.558]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[02:04:54.698 --> 02:05:01.747]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:05:01.948 --> 02:05:04.411]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:05:04.711 --> 02:05:07.374]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice.
[02:05:07.534 --> 02:05:09.035]  Only this time it changed my life.
[02:05:09.315 --> 02:05:11.057]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[02:05:11.157 --> 02:05:13.239]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[02:05:13.439 --> 02:05:15.881]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[02:05:15.941 --> 02:05:18.644]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[02:05:18.844 --> 02:05:19.364]  Side effects?
[02:05:19.545 --> 02:05:21.807]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now too.
[02:05:21.967 --> 02:05:23.268]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[02:05:23.288 --> 02:05:23.488]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[02:05:23.508 --> 02:05:24.309]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[02:05:24.329 --> 02:05:25.230]  It worked for me.
[02:05:31.849 --> 02:05:42.596]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:05:42.776 --> 02:05:50.341]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:05:50.601 --> 02:05:53.744]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable level.
[02:05:54.005 --> 02:05:59.790]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:06:00.031 --> 02:06:06.177]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:06:06.557 --> 02:06:10.440]  The Berkey Light is transparent so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:12.381]  The water level is always visible.
[02:06:12.581 --> 02:06:18.505]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:06:18.745 --> 02:06:22.448]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:06:22.468 --> 02:06:23.268]  That's toll free, triple 8, 803-4438.
[02:06:33.726 --> 02:06:39.750]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:06:40.351 --> 02:06:43.393]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:46.555 --> 02:06:51.619]  We've got Ellen Marinari, Marinari, I keep saying it wrong, on with us.
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:54.461]  And we have her lawyer, Phillip Berg.
[02:06:55.422 --> 02:06:58.244]  And we read a couple days ago her open letter to the President.
[02:06:59.404 --> 02:06:59.725]  And, uh,
[02:07:00.822 --> 02:07:01.923]  Here's a headline.
[02:07:01.943 --> 02:07:03.765]  9-11 in Neverland.
[02:07:03.845 --> 02:07:06.488]  Press ignores Widow's Bush treason lawsuit.
[02:07:06.948 --> 02:07:12.293]  Also, Stanley Hilton, who represents hundreds of the families, Bob Dole's former chief of staff, been on this show several times.
[02:07:12.553 --> 02:07:14.956]  He's suing Bush for involvement, not for prior knowledge.
[02:07:14.976 --> 02:07:17.198]  This is a separate, uh, uh,
[02:07:18.766 --> 02:07:30.250]  Lawsuit, and here to talk about it is Phillip J. Berg, Esquire, her lawyer, and of course, Ellen herself, who lost her husband tragically on September 11th.
[02:07:30.810 --> 02:07:33.891]  Phillip and Ellen, break it down for us.
[02:07:34.031 --> 02:07:37.612]  What's the suit about, what are you charging, and what's the evidence?
[02:07:38.434 --> 02:07:38.815]  Thank you.
[02:07:38.855 --> 02:07:40.016]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:07:40.036 --> 02:07:41.557]  Phil's here and Ellen's on with us.
[02:07:42.738 --> 02:07:44.199]  We really appreciate being on your show.
[02:07:44.219 --> 02:07:45.480]  I appreciate you coming on.
[02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:47.041]  Well, it's our pleasure also.
[02:07:47.261 --> 02:07:50.524]  What we're doing here is we have filed a civil RICO action.
[02:07:50.884 --> 02:07:52.706]  Now, this has to be for your listeners' sake.
[02:07:52.766 --> 02:07:57.670]  RICO stands for Racketeer Influence and Corrupt Organizations Act.
[02:07:58.308 --> 02:08:01.390]  There's civil RICO and criminal RICO.
[02:08:01.690 --> 02:08:10.337]  We're hoping at the end of our civil RICO suit that the government comes in and files a criminal RICO against Bush and his gang and moves them out of office.
[02:08:10.657 --> 02:08:11.557]  That's down the line.
[02:08:11.978 --> 02:08:16.021]  But we're stating here that there was an ongoing scheme, an ongoing pattern.
[02:08:16.441 --> 02:08:19.183]  The RICO Act was first enacted to go after the Mafia.
[02:08:20.047 --> 02:08:24.210]  Now, what we're saying here is, acts occurred even before Bush took office.
[02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:32.695]  His involvement with his father, his family, the Bin Laden family, and it's set out in our 62-page complaint, which was filed on November 26th.
[02:08:33.656 --> 02:08:46.444]  We're stating here that the Bush and the administration, and when we say Bush, we say that because in 1947, what was created was the National Security Act, and under that act,
[02:08:46.980 --> 02:08:57.707]  The president has exclusive oversight of the official and unofficial acts of people for willful and ill-intentioned misconduct of everyone under him in the government.
[02:08:58.107 --> 02:09:01.149]  And we're saying that Bush even had direct information.
[02:09:01.629 --> 02:09:09.954]  We're stating here in our lawsuit that the president and the administration knew about 9-11 beforehand.
[02:09:10.094 --> 02:09:15.818]  In our complaint, we list 100 items now of pre-knowledge of 9-11.
[02:09:17.225 --> 02:09:36.119]  We're stating that the government, that Bush and the government failed to act and prevent 9-11 and thereafter have obstructed justice by failing to release critical intelligence evidence to the public and even more specifically to the 9-11 Commission which was appointed by the President.
[02:09:36.299 --> 02:09:40.903]  Now let's go back first to what happened to Ellen's husband, Mr. Mariani.
[02:09:41.703 --> 02:09:42.844]  What happened to your husband?
[02:09:43.951 --> 02:09:46.332]  We both were on separate flights.
[02:09:46.632 --> 02:09:53.275]  I left two hours before he did, right out of the same airport in Logan, Massachusetts, Boston.
[02:09:55.136 --> 02:09:58.438]  Actually, that morning, it was like 4, 4.30 when I arrived.
[02:09:58.778 --> 02:10:02.780]  Not a human life was around outside.
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:03.941]  Very eerie.
[02:10:03.961 --> 02:10:12.585]  I remember yelling, youhoo, because I could not find my airport, the air place where I was to board.
[02:10:13.735 --> 02:10:23.860]  And so I had to yell and yell, and I found somebody come out in blue or dark black romper type of mechanic outfits, and he pointed to where I was to go to board my plane.
[02:10:24.880 --> 02:10:26.881]  That was the beginning of the end.
[02:10:27.242 --> 02:10:30.343]  I left a married woman and came home a widow.
[02:10:30.763 --> 02:10:38.107]  But I was on flight, and in the air, I believe, I don't know, when I arrived for a changeover plane in Chicago.
[02:10:39.561 --> 02:10:58.453]  Midway and I was informed by a news reporter when I requested to find out why there was thousands of people in this air terminal and I couldn't use a phone and I thought something had happened to our plane and I had called my daughter by asking the air
[02:10:59.278 --> 02:11:01.520]  The newsman, if I could use his cell phone.
[02:11:01.580 --> 02:11:03.341]  And then she said, there's something wrong.
[02:11:03.361 --> 02:11:04.301]  Where are you, Mom?
[02:11:04.361 --> 02:11:05.382]  And she was hysterical.
[02:11:05.842 --> 02:11:06.743]  Where is Neil?
[02:11:06.783 --> 02:11:07.844]  And I said, he's fine.
[02:11:07.924 --> 02:11:09.665]  No, no, no, Ma, something's wrong.
[02:11:09.685 --> 02:11:10.505]  And I hung up on her.
[02:11:10.525 --> 02:11:12.927]  And I said to the reporter, please go find out.
[02:11:13.507 --> 02:11:15.308]  And he came back and just stared at me.
[02:11:15.368 --> 02:11:16.869]  And he said, I shouldn't be the one.
[02:11:16.930 --> 02:11:19.431]  And he informed me that my husband's plane had crashed.
[02:11:20.412 --> 02:11:21.192]  That's all I knew.
[02:11:21.212 --> 02:11:23.374]  I know my ears went deaf.
[02:11:24.154 --> 02:11:25.235]  I know I went into shock.
[02:11:26.252 --> 02:11:29.875]  I know, but the time I come to my senses, there wasn't a person around me.
[02:11:29.895 --> 02:11:31.896]  I don't know how long I was standing there.
[02:11:31.916 --> 02:11:40.983]  Well, you're very strong to come on and talk about this, and in your lawsuit, quote, plans to fight for her late husband's honor by taking on the U.S.
[02:11:41.023 --> 02:11:41.383]  government.
[02:11:41.443 --> 02:11:49.229]  You accused Bush, and I think the evidence is clear, of treason, allowing this to take place, to get power and control, and I believe clearly engineering it.
[02:11:49.589 --> 02:11:52.932]  What was the process like for you in the munch, and then we'll of course go to your
[02:11:53.672 --> 02:11:56.655]  Your wonderful attorney here who's fighting this with you.
[02:11:57.435 --> 02:12:04.020]  What was the process like of waking up and getting these hundred smoking guns, proving the complicity of Lord Bush?
[02:12:04.220 --> 02:12:06.122]  Well, you know, it started out very slowly.
[02:12:07.363 --> 02:12:11.706]  Everybody was in shock, because I didn't know until the next day what really had happened.
[02:12:12.270 --> 02:12:23.059]  And then I thought, my God, we have the most sophisticated of defense, and no one was here to protect our airlines, and it was so-called terrorists, and da-da-da-da.
[02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:26.562]  And I'm saying, no, there's something else wrong here.
[02:12:27.283 --> 02:12:29.485]  No, this is not terrorists.
[02:12:30.365 --> 02:12:31.987]  What's wrong with our defense system?
[02:12:32.427 --> 02:12:37.872]  And I kept that kind of an open mind, and just listened and watched.
[02:12:38.388 --> 02:12:51.020]  And then when I ended up going a few months later to two of the briefings we had in New York courts, it came to me very quickly that there was really something rotten.
[02:12:51.610 --> 02:13:01.655]  Well, look at Payne Stewart, his plane surrounded in 18 minutes by a bunch of F-16s in the middle of the country, the most controlled corridor in the world, and there's no one there.
[02:13:01.795 --> 02:13:09.079]  And then Bush, we find out, knew in his car, in the green room, was watching TV, went out, gave the speech, read the book to the children.
[02:13:09.099 --> 02:13:10.880]  I mean, it's totally staged.
[02:13:11.360 --> 02:13:15.322]  It's terrible, and it's very obvious that they're telling lies.
[02:13:15.503 --> 02:13:18.284]  Okay, let's go to your lawyer, Phillip J. Berg.
[02:13:19.184 --> 02:13:19.485]  Phillip,
[02:13:21.368 --> 02:13:29.692]  The 100 points, what you're saying in this lawsuit, I've read over it, it's sterling, powerful, backed up info, but you know the power of the executive to block all this.
[02:13:30.012 --> 02:13:33.554]  Let's go through the lawsuit and then what you think they're going to try to do to stop you.
[02:13:33.974 --> 02:13:38.777]  Well, they'll first try to get it dismissed under the theory of national security.
[02:13:39.677 --> 02:13:45.360]  And our position is that the security of this nation is founded upon the individuals in this country.
[02:13:46.179 --> 02:13:50.561]  And we have to stress that every person in this country is important, and the truth must come out.
[02:13:51.101 --> 02:14:01.084]  I would guess between 80 and 95 percent of the people in this country believe that we have not been told the truth about 9-11, and they're going to try to hide it under national security.
[02:14:01.924 --> 02:14:03.425]  I think we can overcome that.
[02:14:03.625 --> 02:14:11.328]  We're going to fight if we have to take it to the Supreme Court, but I think the biggest fight we can have is if the American public starts standing up with us on this.
[02:14:11.568 --> 02:14:12.328]  Public opinion!
[02:14:12.788 --> 02:14:13.310]  I think so.
[02:14:24.828 --> 02:14:32.670]  In Europe right now, in Germany and in London and the Netherlands, they're covering this story big time over there, since our complaint came out last week.
[02:14:33.070 --> 02:14:45.432]  And it's very hard here, the press isn't, but through national radio and shows like yours, and we were on one of your sister stations, where you broadcast into Rhode Island, and this morning we happened to be on the Jack Blood Show up on WARL.
[02:14:45.452 --> 02:14:48.193]  JackBlood.com, it's a great website.
[02:14:50.355 --> 02:14:57.678]  We really, what we're trying to do now is gather the 100 points we have here and people can get it from various websites.
[02:14:57.719 --> 02:15:01.180]  We don't have a website yet, we're trying to get it up, we're just running late on that.
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:04.442]  But these 100 points we got, let me stress this to your listeners.
[02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:09.883]  This is information we've gathered from reliable news sources around the country.
[02:15:24.634 --> 02:15:28.458]  And these points, and I have to stress to your listeners, is very important, we have gathered these points without
[02:15:46.829 --> 02:15:47.089]  We're good.
[02:15:59.924 --> 02:16:00.805]  This is significant.
[02:16:00.905 --> 02:16:03.909]  This is information right in the government.
[02:16:03.989 --> 02:16:20.588]  And what is alarming is the fact that the White House has refused to give the 9-11 Commission, which they appointed, important documents such as the PDBs, which are the Presidential Daily Briefings, which would then note exactly what the President knew and when he knew it.
[02:16:21.460 --> 02:16:24.863]  Which, Cynthia McKinney's been attacked for just asking that question.
[02:16:25.123 --> 02:16:30.888]  Instead, the CIA gets more funds, he goes and has a round of applause, a celebration there, a few days after.
[02:16:30.948 --> 02:16:31.828]  This is disgusting!
[02:16:32.669 --> 02:16:33.630]  Absolutely.
[02:16:34.711 --> 02:16:43.878]  And the American public, this is so significant because what has happened since 9-11, even before it with the complicity in the occurrence of 9-11, but since then,
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:50.005]  The enactment of the Patriot Act, the enactment of the Stabilization Act, which created the Feinberg Fund.
[02:16:50.385 --> 02:16:54.088]  These were all done to circumvent the truth and take away people's rights.
[02:16:54.308 --> 02:16:56.070]  Well, they tried to appoint Henry Kissinger.
[02:16:56.110 --> 02:16:58.111]  I mean, how transparent is that?
[02:16:58.352 --> 02:16:58.792]  That's right.
[02:16:59.232 --> 02:17:08.260]  But even Max Cleland, unfortunately, the most outspoken person on the 9-11 Commission, was, for whatever reason, either they had something... Well, he's going to get a big federal banking job.
[02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:13.324]  Yeah, either he couldn't resist the opportunity they gave him, but, in effect, they bought him off the Commission.
[02:17:13.684 --> 02:17:24.227]  Let me ask you real quick and we'll come back and get into the lawsuit more and talk to Ellen more about it and how much courage she has.
[02:17:24.527 --> 02:17:26.528]  Do you know where Stanley Hilton's lawsuit is?
[02:17:26.548 --> 02:17:28.128]  He's got hundreds of the families.
[02:17:28.168 --> 02:17:33.950]  He's saying basically the same thing that Bush is behind it, didn't let it happen, is behind it.
[02:17:34.802 --> 02:17:37.724]  I do not know the status of that case right now.
[02:17:38.204 --> 02:17:45.188]  But again, they ignore him in the media, they ignore you, the majority of the families that I've seen are out here saying it, but it's never on the news.
[02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:47.450]  Well, we're not going to let them ignore it.
[02:17:47.490 --> 02:17:49.131]  We're going to go through stations like you.
[02:17:49.881 --> 02:17:54.442]  A lot of rock stars in this country, without naming them, have come out, spoken out against Bush.
[02:17:54.822 --> 02:17:59.963]  We're hoping to get, like, a concert together by these individuals, which will have to be covered by the media.
[02:18:00.163 --> 02:18:00.483]  Wonderful!
[02:18:00.543 --> 02:18:06.344]  Look at the coverage that's going right now on Michael Jackson, on that case, versus the lack of coverage on this major case.
[02:18:06.864 --> 02:18:08.525]  Absolutely, we've got to do that.
[02:18:08.985 --> 02:18:11.965]  Set the bushfires in the minds of men and women, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[02:18:11.985 --> 02:18:19.527]  We need a national day every year where we march in every city, exposing how the military-industrial complex carried this attack out.
[02:18:20.526 --> 02:18:22.548]  We'll be back with our guest.
[02:18:22.628 --> 02:18:26.013]  Ladies and gentlemen, you'll definitely want to stay with us.
[02:18:26.173 --> 02:18:30.198]  And later, if it's okay with our guest, we'll open the phones up and take calls as well.
[02:18:30.238 --> 02:18:30.639]  Stay with me.
[02:18:32.361 --> 02:18:32.781]  Gold.
[02:18:33.142 --> 02:18:34.422]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:18:34.683 --> 02:18:40.767]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:18:40.947 --> 02:18:44.789]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:18:45.129 --> 02:18:47.031]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:18:47.071 --> 02:18:49.352]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:18:49.512 --> 02:18:55.316]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[02:18:55.336 --> 02:18:55.736]  We're good to go.
[02:19:25.247 --> 02:19:27.228]  Gold, you must read this report.

[02:22:37.541 --> 02:22:39.442]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:22:39.922 --> 02:22:42.744]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:45.625 --> 02:22:51.249]  Ellen Mariani is our guest, and of course her lawyer, Philip J. Berg.
[02:22:51.269 --> 02:22:57.772]  9-11 victim's wife plans to fight for her late husband's honor by taking on the U.S.
[02:22:57.792 --> 02:22:58.172]  government.
[02:22:59.233 --> 02:23:06.537]  I read the letter again on Monday and she talks about how she believes the evidence is clear that Bush had prior knowledge a lot of take place
[02:23:07.481 --> 02:23:10.402]  It's a wild conspiracy theory to believe their official story.
[02:23:10.442 --> 02:23:11.682]  We know we're being lied to.
[02:23:13.503 --> 02:23:24.027]  Going back to Phillip Berg, some of the other hundred points you cover in the lawsuit, the process of the lawsuit, what's going to develop, sir?
[02:23:25.287 --> 02:23:26.808]  Develop is, you know, they're going to have pleadings.
[02:23:26.848 --> 02:23:29.729]  The next step, probably, they're going to try to throw me out on some technicality.
[02:23:30.109 --> 02:23:31.209]  But we're prepared.
[02:23:31.689 --> 02:23:33.190]  Also, from people around the country,
[02:23:34.144 --> 02:23:47.088]  We're also getting input as to additional things to put into our complaint, additional knowledge that other people have, additional points going back on the actions of Bush even before he got into office with his family ties, which is important.
[02:23:47.408 --> 02:23:56.251]  We need an ongoing scheme for Rico to survive, and we believe we have that going back to his father, and we've named him as a defendant in the case.
[02:23:56.591 --> 02:23:58.091]  The ties would have been modern family.
[02:23:58.391 --> 02:24:03.593]  Of significance to your listeners should be the fact that when all planes were ground on September 11th,
[02:24:04.580 --> 02:24:11.605]  For the next three or four days, a plane was allowed to leave the United States with Bin Laden family members on it, and that had to be cleared through the White House.
[02:24:12.266 --> 02:24:16.449]  You know, why was that plane allowed to leave and take people out of this country without being questioned?
[02:24:17.209 --> 02:24:22.733]  There's so many unanswered questions here that the administration owes to the public.
[02:24:22.773 --> 02:24:31.680]  Not owes to me, not owes to Ellen, I mean owes to Ellen because her husband was murdered in this action, but owes to every citizen in this country because
[02:24:32.319 --> 02:24:34.780]  If the foreknowledge was there, why weren't we warned?
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:36.761]  Where were all our military aircraft?
[02:24:36.781 --> 02:24:38.462]  You know, why weren't they scrambled?
[02:24:38.863 --> 02:24:45.446]  If not before, that at 8.20 that morning, they should have been all scrambled because they had foreknowledge that could happen.
[02:24:45.786 --> 02:24:48.588]  They knew at 8.20 a plane was missing and nothing happened.
[02:24:49.008 --> 02:24:58.193]  Also, I mean, Robert Wright, one of the FBI agents, got up at the National Press Club, held up a letter and said, I've been threatened with arrest if I tell you what I know about Bush and the Bin Ladens.
[02:24:58.926 --> 02:25:04.170]  Bush signed W199I, ordering the FBI not to stop Al-Qaeda in this country.
[02:25:04.330 --> 02:25:11.696]  On 9-11, they flew out, after the attacks, 144 members of the Royal Saudi and Bin Laden family, who the Bushes are best buddies with.
[02:25:11.716 --> 02:25:12.476]  That's right.
[02:25:13.657 --> 02:25:15.679]  And answers must be given on that.
[02:25:16.239 --> 02:25:21.023]  And Ellen and I, and people around me, we're prepared to go forth with this.
[02:25:21.423 --> 02:25:25.326]  We're asking all the people in this country to give us their moral support behind this.
[02:25:25.879 --> 02:25:30.162]  And any knowledge they have, because they're probably some of your listeners, might have some knowledge.
[02:25:30.242 --> 02:25:31.823]  Might have been in New York that day.
[02:25:32.184 --> 02:25:33.565]  Might have been in Washington that day.
[02:25:33.925 --> 02:25:35.186]  Might have been in Boston that day.
[02:25:35.266 --> 02:25:44.453]  If anyone knows anything and are afraid to give it, let them give it to your show or to me, Andre, in an affidavit with a different name, and we'll protect them.
[02:25:44.861 --> 02:25:49.262]  You know, give us the facts, under an alias at this point, and then we'll confirm it later.
[02:25:49.643 --> 02:25:52.143]  But we need to go in, because there's information out there.
[02:25:52.163 --> 02:25:54.844]  We need to go in and depose these high-level military officers.
[02:25:54.884 --> 02:25:56.185]  I know Hilton's talked to some of them.
[02:25:56.765 --> 02:25:58.826]  They're saying that an ORAB was ordered to stand down.
[02:25:58.866 --> 02:26:00.526]  Well, it had to be ordered to stand down.
[02:26:00.566 --> 02:26:01.487]  That's right.
[02:26:01.687 --> 02:26:05.128]  And they were on a practice run that day, so, you know, give me a break.
[02:26:05.508 --> 02:26:09.629]  You know, even if we didn't know anything, some of your listeners probably say, well, you know, this is nonsense.
[02:26:10.049 --> 02:26:14.431]  The minute that first plane crashed into a building, if we give up at 821, it was missing.
[02:26:14.873 --> 02:26:31.910]  At 8.48, when the first plane hit the first World Trade Center, with all the foreknowledge, they should have been under attack, and at that point, the jet should have been scrambled, and plane number two, the plane flight 175 that Ellen Mariani's husband, Lewis, was on, should have been not allowed to hit the World Trade Center.
[02:26:32.271 --> 02:26:35.454]  And then, again, right at about 8 in the morning,
[02:26:36.525 --> 02:26:43.451]  The CIA says they're running a drill of flying planes into buildings in New York and D.C., and that's the cover for NORAD to stand down.
[02:26:43.491 --> 02:26:45.252]  I mean, is this not blaringly obvious?
[02:26:45.492 --> 02:26:51.417]  Then the White House says, we never heard of plans to fly planes into buildings, and that morning, they're running a drill!
[02:26:51.437 --> 02:26:52.098]  That's right.
[02:26:52.862 --> 02:26:58.711]  And we have a sworn affidavit which is attached to our complaint from someone who was in the military 25 years ago.
[02:26:58.731 --> 02:27:05.701]  A study was made by the United States federal government of what would happen if planes were flown into buildings in the United States.
[02:27:06.021 --> 02:27:06.983]  So the government knew.
[02:27:07.103 --> 02:27:07.724]  Also, in 1993,
[02:27:09.588 --> 02:27:16.412]  When they attempted to blow up a World Trade Center building, at that time it came out that they had planned to use planes to fly into the building.
[02:27:16.772 --> 02:27:20.154]  So the government here had foreknowledge and didn't do anything about it.
[02:27:20.174 --> 02:27:26.317]  By the way, did you know that the Chicago Tribune and New York Times reported that the FBI cooked the bomb and trained the driver in the first World Trade Center?
[02:27:26.597 --> 02:27:27.318]  No, I didn't know that.
[02:27:28.138 --> 02:27:29.679]  That's the end of my film, Road to Tyranny.
[02:27:29.699 --> 02:27:32.141]  I'll have to get you a copy of that.
[02:27:34.322 --> 02:27:37.103]  Ellen, any points you want to add here?
[02:27:37.684 --> 02:27:37.884]  Yes.
[02:27:38.863 --> 02:27:42.424]  We, the families of our lost loved ones, have a right.
[02:27:44.105 --> 02:27:46.086]  It is the duty of our government.
[02:27:46.526 --> 02:27:49.888]  See, and they didn't stand behind us and defend our country.
[02:27:50.248 --> 02:27:56.030]  My husband was in the Air Force for four years and he had to die with a shame on our own soil.
[02:27:56.470 --> 02:28:03.093]  We have a right to know why he blocked 28 pages with his own hand with a black marker.
[02:28:03.133 --> 02:28:04.153]  Mr. Bush did that.
[02:28:04.173 --> 02:28:04.874]  Well, we know why.
[02:28:04.934 --> 02:28:05.534]  The Saudis
[02:28:06.203 --> 02:28:11.744]  You said that if you release that, we're going to release the names of the four banks that run Saudi Arabia.
[02:28:12.104 --> 02:28:12.885]  We've got a break.
[02:28:13.525 --> 02:28:14.045]  Stay there.
[02:28:14.725 --> 02:28:17.226]  We'll be right back with more key information.
[02:28:17.326 --> 02:28:17.906]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:17.926 --> 02:28:18.266]  Stay with us.
[02:28:23.087 --> 02:28:24.007]  We're on the march.
[02:28:24.508 --> 02:28:26.108]  The empire's on the run.
[02:28:27.028 --> 02:28:29.729]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:33.191 --> 02:28:37.092]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:28:37.312 --> 02:28:49.597]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:28:50.017 --> 02:28:50.417]  The U.S.
[02:28:50.457 --> 02:28:56.039]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:28:56.439 --> 02:28:58.640]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:29:00.515 --> 02:29:04.456]  It's bad enough that the US citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:29:04.576 --> 02:29:10.577]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:29:11.017 --> 02:29:14.358]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[02:29:14.438 --> 02:29:20.819]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[02:29:21.359 --> 02:29:25.360]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.

[02:29:28.430 --> 02:29:28.733]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:29:33.171 --> 02:29:36.712]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[02:29:37.052 --> 02:29:37.372]  Yes.
[02:29:37.652 --> 02:29:40.032]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood.
[02:29:40.292 --> 02:29:42.453]  The richest nutritional liquid known to man.

[02:29:51.655 --> 02:29:59.356]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.

[02:31:28.645 --> 02:31:30.386]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[02:31:31.146 --> 02:31:38.909]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:39.589 --> 02:31:41.930]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:31:45.911 --> 02:31:51.153]  Alright, we're talking to Ellen Mariani, and we're talking to her lawyer, Philip J. Berg.
[02:31:52.449 --> 02:31:53.790]  She's suing Bush for treason.
[02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:57.372]  I want to read from her letter to the president.
[02:31:57.932 --> 02:32:02.375]  Well, there are abundant reasons for rejecting the further expansion of the military's domestic role.
[02:32:03.096 --> 02:32:10.240]  We'll also be discussing the whole martial law scenario and how her letter gets into martial law.
[02:32:11.229 --> 02:32:14.150]  And, well, you know, the whole Homeland Security Patriot Act garbage.
[02:32:14.370 --> 02:32:22.053]  She says, quote, from her letter, it is my belief that you intentionally allowed 9-11 to happen, to gather public support for a war on terrorism.
[02:32:22.073 --> 02:32:26.975]  These wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have not accomplished what you stated were your goals.
[02:32:27.315 --> 02:32:29.116]  Why have you not captured Osama bin Laden?
[02:32:29.176 --> 02:32:31.036]  Where are Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction?
[02:32:31.557 --> 02:32:37.999]  All that has happened is a bill that has passed before Congress for $87 million to rebuild what you ordered blown to bits.
[02:32:38.599 --> 02:32:46.106]  As an American who lost a loved one in the war on terror, I do pray and support our troops who have been sent to Afghanistan and Iraq by you.
[02:32:46.466 --> 02:32:49.889]  These troops have and will continue to die for your lies.
[02:32:50.029 --> 02:32:53.032]  As an American, I can make this statement.
[02:32:53.892 --> 02:32:59.317]  As it appears that associates of your family may stand to prosper from the rebuilding of Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:32:59.738 --> 02:33:00.318]  May stand?
[02:33:00.498 --> 02:33:01.259]  That's all over the place.
[02:33:01.903 --> 02:33:07.766]  She goes on to say at the end of the letter, in the court of public opinion, Mr. Bush, your lies are being uncovered each day.
[02:33:08.166 --> 02:33:16.950]  My husband, all the other victims, and their families, and our nation as a whole, has been victimized by your failed leadership prior to and after 9-11.
[02:33:17.050 --> 02:33:18.511]  I will prove this in a court of law.
[02:33:20.251 --> 02:33:21.672]  And that's from Ellen.
[02:33:22.739 --> 02:33:24.580]  And again, her husband died there.
[02:33:24.600 --> 02:33:32.304]  If you want to join us on air and talk to Mr. Berg or talk to Ellen, the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:32.324 --> 02:33:32.424]  800-259-9231.
[02:33:32.604 --> 02:33:38.427]  And when I say I, quote, have a link to their website, I have links to the news articles and websites that have the documents and the lawsuit
[02:33:46.771 --> 02:33:49.452]  Uh, there, and press releases as well.
[02:33:49.932 --> 02:33:57.414]  So please go get those and email them out to everybody because, again, we've got to give legs to this important movement against these tyrants.
[02:33:57.594 --> 02:34:01.916]  And yeah, Bill Clinton defeated impeachment, but it still exposed him for the criminal he was.
[02:34:02.376 --> 02:34:04.756]  Well, this dwarfs Bill Clinton.
[02:34:05.337 --> 02:34:13.199]  This is much bigger, more elaborate, and Bush is their puppet, but still he's the titular head for all of this, and certainly has knowledge of these activities.
[02:34:14.019 --> 02:34:30.245]  Ellen, I don't want to scare you, obviously you've thought all this through, but the woman that sued Bush saying he raped her decades ago, I didn't make much of it, I just read the lawsuit on air, she got shot in the back of the head a few weeks ago, and you guys have had to think about the fact that this is dangerous.
[02:34:31.205 --> 02:34:36.347]  Well, if you do not all wake up, the whole country is in danger.
[02:34:37.407 --> 02:34:41.749]  We've lost our rights so far and we're still losing more of our rights.
[02:34:42.927 --> 02:34:46.068]  All the bills that he's put in after have taken our rights away.
[02:34:46.208 --> 02:34:52.590]  And Phil, if you could quote a couple of those where they can knock at your door and enter without any court order.
[02:34:52.610 --> 02:34:55.131]  Yeah, that's section 213 of H.R.
[02:34:55.471 --> 02:34:55.131]  3162.
[02:34:55.511 --> 02:35:02.173]  The definition of a terrorist, 802, is any action that endangers human life that's a violation of any federal or state law.
[02:35:02.773 --> 02:35:04.554]  You're a lawyer, sir, a student of the law.
[02:35:04.594 --> 02:35:08.995]  What does that mean if you're a terrorist, if you do something that breaks a federal or state law?
[02:35:10.069 --> 02:35:12.070]  Well, see, you're at their mercy.
[02:35:12.130 --> 02:35:18.334]  I mean, right now they could say that I'm a subversive because of the claims I'm making against the president and the administration.
[02:35:18.714 --> 02:35:25.998]  They could walk in here right now under that Patriot Act, take me away and not allow me to speak to an attorney or, you know, just to pull me away.
[02:35:26.358 --> 02:35:32.582]  So I'm hoping by the most visibility that Ellen and I can have, the safer we will become.
[02:35:33.138 --> 02:35:33.879]  I want to say that too.
[02:35:33.899 --> 02:35:36.140]  Alex Jones has never contemplated, will never commit suicide.
[02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:36.921]  I'm an excellent swimmer.
[02:35:52.351 --> 02:35:59.054]  I do not play with loaded guns by myself in dark rooms or on the side of dark highway roads.
[02:35:59.855 --> 02:36:01.356]  But what you just said is true.
[02:36:01.496 --> 02:36:03.376]  More of us standing up, we outnumber them.
[02:36:03.617 --> 02:36:06.398]  There are hundreds of other families suing saying the same thing.
[02:36:06.798 --> 02:36:09.159]  There are many other people out there doing this.
[02:36:09.199 --> 02:36:13.421]  There are hundreds of publications, hundreds of talk show hosts, hundreds of books and videos.
[02:36:13.822 --> 02:36:15.682]  More of us have to stand up.
[02:36:15.762 --> 02:36:16.323]  That's the key.
[02:36:16.363 --> 02:36:16.723]  Go ahead.
[02:36:17.083 --> 02:36:19.326]  Now that is the key, and our website will be up.
[02:36:19.366 --> 02:36:19.907]  We don't have it.
[02:36:19.947 --> 02:36:24.031]  We didn't realize the amazing response we would be getting in the past few days.
[02:36:24.051 --> 02:36:31.080]  So we're not prepared for that, but we are also, we thank people like you who are putting up on their websites the connections to us.
[02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:41.036]  We are starting a fund for this because it's an enormous task here, and we're starting a 9-11 for the truth, and hopefully that'll be our website, but we'll let you know.
[02:36:41.336 --> 02:36:49.401]  But we're asking everyone in this country to send $9.11 in, and we'll give you a link to my office here where we're going to send it, $9.11.
[02:36:49.761 --> 02:36:57.146]  And if we can get people behind it, we will have the resources necessary to take the depositions, to use the subpoena power.
[02:36:58.109 --> 02:37:00.612]  To get the information we want out there.
[02:37:00.652 --> 02:37:06.419]  Is that Phillip J. Berg, Esquire 706 Ridge Pike, Lafayette Hill, PA 19444?
[02:37:06.599 --> 02:37:07.460]  That's correct.
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:09.362]  And if everyone sends $9.11,
[02:37:12.549 --> 02:37:16.571]  We thought that that figure is something that identifies the most with this cause.
[02:37:16.931 --> 02:37:19.192]  We will put it to good use to find out the truth.
[02:37:19.692 --> 02:37:22.373]  My client's end result, what she wants is one thing.
[02:37:22.393 --> 02:37:23.714]  She wants the truth.
[02:37:24.154 --> 02:37:26.815]  Where have you entered your, where has your lawsuit been filed?
[02:37:27.135 --> 02:37:31.537]  We filed the case in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.
[02:37:31.857 --> 02:37:35.340]  Mr. Berg, I mean, from talking to you, but I don't want to put words in your mouth, and Ellen as well,
[02:37:55.925 --> 02:38:12.698]  Mariani, tell us exactly, I mean, what, you have the evidence that their story's a lie, that they had prior knowledge, that's totally demonstrated, that there's racketeering going back with the Bin Ladens and the Saudis, with the Bushes for decades, business partnerships in the 70s, protecting them, flying them out of the country.
[02:38:13.658 --> 02:38:20.484]  We know all this, but bottom line, from the evidence you've seen, what do you think really happened on 9-11?
[02:38:21.687 --> 02:38:26.711]  Well, I think obviously the government knew that this was going to take place.
[02:38:28.673 --> 02:38:35.559]  Bush and the top level of people in this country knew something was going to happen, and then they knew on 9-11.
[02:38:35.599 --> 02:38:39.282]  On 9-10, many government officials were told not to fly on 9-11.
[02:38:40.781 --> 02:38:42.983]  How many people like Bush were out of Washington?
[02:38:43.023 --> 02:38:44.023]  Bush was in Florida.
[02:38:45.244 --> 02:38:55.551]  You know, Jeb Bush afterwards, the President's brother, the Governor of Florida, went into the flight school down there in Florida and took out many of the documents, put them on a government plane, and they were flown out of the country.
[02:38:56.351 --> 02:38:57.492]  There is so much evidence.
[02:38:57.532 --> 02:39:03.894]  By the way, all of the stuff you're mentioning is admitted mainstream media, but again, it's pieces here, pieces there.
[02:39:03.934 --> 02:39:05.995]  You look at all the pieces, it's totally clear.
[02:39:06.435 --> 02:39:06.856]  That's right.
[02:39:07.036 --> 02:39:11.658]  But what we have done here is, you know, there's other lawsuits against the President for different reasons.
[02:39:11.678 --> 02:39:13.458]  There's some lawsuits against the Saudis.
[02:39:13.959 --> 02:39:21.882]  But we have taken the bold step of filing a civil RICO action against Bush and this administration to seek out the truth, to put it all together.
[02:39:22.307 --> 02:39:23.268]  We have our timeline.
[02:39:23.288 --> 02:39:24.589]  We have the hundred points there.
[02:39:25.030 --> 02:39:31.416]  My guess is when we're done doing research, we'll probably have the thousand points of light that they talk about.
[02:39:31.456 --> 02:39:38.883]  We'll have a thousand or thousands of points of evidence that this occurred, and it should not have occurred, and we're going to seek the truth out.
[02:39:39.143 --> 02:39:41.606]  Philip Berg, you're an interesting individual.
[02:39:41.626 --> 02:39:42.767]  Obviously, you have a lot of courage.
[02:39:42.927 --> 02:39:43.688]  What's your background?
[02:39:43.728 --> 02:39:44.328]  I'm just curious.
[02:39:44.729 --> 02:39:45.450]  I am an attorney.
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:48.501]  I'm a former Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania.
[02:39:48.521 --> 02:39:49.481]  I served for eight years.
[02:39:49.901 --> 02:39:52.102]  I was a candidate for Governor of Pennsylvania.
[02:39:52.582 --> 02:39:55.863]  I also ran for some other political offices, including the United States Senate.
[02:39:56.883 --> 02:40:02.785]  My biggest problem is, I guess I should have been quiet and kissed some butt years ago, gotten into office, and then kicked ass.
[02:40:03.225 --> 02:40:14.388]  But since then, pardon my French, but since then, over the years, I've been outspoken and taken strong stands for individual rights for years, and I think it's essential that everyone in this country
[02:40:15.029 --> 02:40:22.876]  Wake up, open their eyes, talk about this topic, and start demanding of their United States Senators and Representatives to put pressure on the White House.
[02:40:23.276 --> 02:40:28.401]  Together, we can overcome the injustice that has occurred in this country.
[02:40:28.421 --> 02:40:37.329]  The loss of lives of 3,000 individuals is tremendous, but the worst part is the rights that are being taken away every day by this administration.
[02:40:37.469 --> 02:40:44.213]  Well that's, and again you have incredible courage, we're honored to have you, and of course Ellen, who lost her husband.
[02:40:44.233 --> 02:40:47.615]  I would tell you that we have a lot of homeschoolers listening, just for you and the audience.
[02:40:47.895 --> 02:40:49.616]  I'm not mad at you, but you're right.
[02:40:49.936 --> 02:40:51.657]  Let's watch the French here, as you said.
[02:40:51.677 --> 02:40:52.418]  I'm sorry.
[02:40:52.578 --> 02:40:53.498]  No, no, no, it's okay.
[02:40:54.299 --> 02:40:57.801]  It's just that we have a lot of homeschoolers listening, a lot of Christian stations picking us up.
[02:40:57.861 --> 02:40:59.162]  My personal apologies.
[02:40:59.202 --> 02:41:02.724]  No, no, I understand you get upset, and you know what, your life's on the line here.
[02:41:03.883 --> 02:41:12.910]  And as you said, you're not planning to commit suicide, you never will, and you guys are amazing, and we're all upset, and when you see this evidence... I agree with you, though.
[02:41:12.990 --> 02:41:25.880]  Most people I talk to, and I've done thousands of radio interviews, I've done hundreds of my own show, here I am on all these AM and FM stations across the country, huge internet audience, and no one calls in to disagree with this, because the facts are there!
[02:41:26.642 --> 02:41:33.548]  I mean, I've been on thousands of radio shows, myself as a guest, about my films, and I'll do more interviews, folks.
[02:41:33.568 --> 02:41:37.171]  You can call your local station and tell them to have me on.
[02:41:37.211 --> 02:41:39.993]  And one out of 30 calls might call and disagree with us.
[02:41:40.433 --> 02:41:43.096]  So, you know, the media acts like we're conspiracy theorists.
[02:41:43.116 --> 02:41:45.878]  We're asking real questions about real evidence, but it's like the
[02:41:45.998 --> 02:41:46.138]  Yes.
[02:41:46.178 --> 02:41:46.258]  Yes.
[02:42:02.358 --> 02:42:06.541]  The official government plan to carry out terror attacks to get us to get into wars.
[02:42:06.982 --> 02:42:15.388]  Bush's PNAC document, written by Dick Cheney in 2000, saying we need to have terrorist attacks to get the people behind our war to take over 63 countries.
[02:42:15.908 --> 02:42:20.652]  I mean, we have these people too, in their own publications, bragging.
[02:42:21.012 --> 02:42:24.715]  Explain to your listeners about, they might not know Alex, if you don't mind, the Northwood documents.
[02:42:26.337 --> 02:42:42.260]  Well, it's the official government plan that got green-lighted all the way up to the president who said no to it in 1962, John F. Kennedy, and it called for hijacking jets, flying them into structures, crashing them, bombing ships, attacking Marines, killing them, committing sniper attacks in D.C.
[02:42:42.300 --> 02:42:48.962]  and Miami to be blamed on foreign enemies as a, quote, they said, casualty list in U.S.
[02:42:49.022 --> 02:42:55.363]  newspapers, dead Americans in newspapers, would cause a helpful wave of national indignation or mobilization.
[02:42:56.136 --> 02:42:58.747]  And then, and thank God, Kennedy said no.
[02:43:00.609 --> 02:43:02.651]  Or we'd have had this martial law sooner.
[02:43:02.671 --> 02:43:03.211]  That's right.
[02:43:03.351 --> 02:43:03.751]  That's right.
[02:43:03.771 --> 02:43:04.672]  But that was stopped.
[02:43:04.752 --> 02:43:06.954]  It was brought up to the top level of government.
[02:43:06.974 --> 02:43:08.455]  It was prepared by government officials.
[02:43:08.955 --> 02:43:10.376]  And John F. Kennedy stopped that.
[02:43:10.816 --> 02:43:12.778]  And unfortunately now Bush is not stopping.
[02:43:12.818 --> 02:43:14.319]  Bush is going on with these things.
[02:43:14.399 --> 02:43:17.601]  And what occurred on 9-11 is a disaster.
[02:43:17.621 --> 02:43:18.782]  The evidence is gone.
[02:43:18.902 --> 02:43:20.723]  You know, they took the steel away.
[02:43:20.803 --> 02:43:21.944]  They melted down the steel.
[02:43:21.984 --> 02:43:24.106]  The evidence from the crime scene is gone.
[02:43:24.626 --> 02:43:27.368]  You know, if people don't want to believe, and there's some questions about
[02:43:27.893 --> 02:43:29.354]  Folks, the toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:43:29.394 --> 02:43:30.755]  Is it okay if we take some calls?
[02:43:55.382 --> 02:43:57.324]  Uh, let's talk to Joe in Texas.
[02:43:57.404 --> 02:43:58.244]  Joe, you're on the air.
[02:43:58.284 --> 02:43:58.705]  Go ahead.
[02:44:00.306 --> 02:44:00.726]  Hello, Alex?
[02:44:00.946 --> 02:44:01.346]  Yes, sir.
[02:44:02.247 --> 02:44:07.931]  Yeah, um, I had a question, but I had a comment on something that's not, that's kind of not related, but it's kind of phony, though.
[02:44:08.491 --> 02:44:16.017]  Down here in the Killian area, they're taking, uh, for seven bucks an hour for, I think, 90 days, they're having people pretend like they're Iraqi insurgents.
[02:44:17.378 --> 02:44:23.565]  Yeah, they have urban warfare training drills for the last 10 years, training us for martial law.
[02:44:24.046 --> 02:44:29.411]  And I have the LA Times with the head of NORTHCOM, our new military dictatorship, saying we need troops on the streets.
[02:44:29.692 --> 02:44:35.618]  And this is why this lawsuit is so important, because they're going to carry out more terror as a pretext for more control.
[02:44:35.919 --> 02:44:37.000]  Comments Phillip and Ellen.
[02:44:38.942 --> 02:44:40.804]  Well, you know, Joe, that's important.
[02:44:40.844 --> 02:44:44.769]  I mean, and that has to be related out to people around this country, what the planning is.
[02:44:44.829 --> 02:44:50.677]  And this is all planning to, you know, for them to, like, protect us after they do something else crazy.
[02:44:51.438 --> 02:44:54.141]  And I would see that right before or right after the election.
[02:44:54.181 --> 02:44:56.564]  If Bush thinks he'll win, he may wait till after the election.
[02:44:57.458 --> 02:45:03.279]  Well, we're hoping he does not win, and we're hoping even through this lawsuit he's out of office before the end of his term.
[02:45:03.559 --> 02:45:09.521]  Well, they've gone, the problem is they've gone so far, it's like once you're in the bank robbing it, you really can't turn back.
[02:45:09.781 --> 02:45:10.301]  That's correct.
[02:45:10.681 --> 02:45:12.061]  And that's what makes them so dangerous.
[02:45:12.121 --> 02:45:14.942]  I mean, you said that you were in the Deputy Attorney General?
[02:45:16.302 --> 02:45:17.802]  Yes, of Pennsylvania.
[02:45:17.822 --> 02:45:19.363]  So, you know how the criminal mind works.
[02:45:19.483 --> 02:45:21.363]  Apply criminology to this.
[02:45:21.423 --> 02:45:24.324]  I mean, they've gone so far in the cover-up, they can't stop.
[02:45:24.364 --> 02:45:25.804]  I guess all we can do is warn people.
[02:45:26.414 --> 02:45:26.894]  That's correct.
[02:45:27.035 --> 02:45:39.046]  I think we all should go to our Senators, too, because they turned around, didn't read what they were signing right after 9-11, actually while the bodies were still burning, of our loved ones, and signed the stabilization bill in.
[02:45:39.406 --> 02:45:42.389]  And it did protect the airlines from being sued.
[02:45:42.849 --> 02:45:45.872]  And if Bill would mention how that works for me?
[02:45:47.173 --> 02:45:47.994]  I'm sorry, what's that, Ellen?
[02:45:48.334 --> 02:45:51.117]  Would you mention how the stabilization bill was
[02:45:51.874 --> 02:45:55.395]  Well, the Stabilization Act came into being and it basically created the Feinberg Fund.
[02:45:55.415 --> 02:45:58.716]  The Feinberg Fund said, you know, we will pay you a certain amount of money.
[02:45:58.776 --> 02:46:00.637]  Ken Feinberg will make a decision on his own.
[02:46:00.957 --> 02:46:03.878]  If you waive suing us and keep your mouth shut.
[02:46:03.898 --> 02:46:04.378]  That's correct.
[02:46:04.398 --> 02:46:04.678]  That's right.
[02:46:04.958 --> 02:46:06.018]  Yeah, so payoff money.
[02:46:06.078 --> 02:46:08.659]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee and then Donna in New York.
[02:46:09.179 --> 02:46:09.940]  John, you're on the air.
[02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:10.380]  Go ahead.
[02:46:11.160 --> 02:46:15.421]  Yes, I volunteer my free services to set up a free website to report your lawsuit.
[02:46:16.482 --> 02:46:20.303]  My family of lawyers are in the Ness Motley class action suing the Saudis for their
[02:46:21.019 --> 02:46:21.800]  We're good to go.
[02:46:47.199 --> 02:47:04.104]  For the past two weeks, our Skull & Bones Mayor, Knoxville City Council, and Newspaper & TV were forced to admit this cartel and its lawyers and politicians are guilty of fraud, criminal conspiracy, racketeering, organized crime, and urge the District Attorney General to pursue criminal prosecution.
[02:47:04.865 --> 02:47:12.067]  Now, these involve BFI's ties to its towing, car theft, scrap metal, and chop shop divisions as government contractors.
[02:47:12.938 --> 02:47:20.844]  Now we need to move the 9-1-1 litigation into the criminal courts using criminal affidavits of complaint from the victims and special prosecutors.
[02:47:20.945 --> 02:47:21.745]  Let me get a comment.
[02:47:21.785 --> 02:47:24.167]  That's a mouthful from Mr. Berg.
[02:47:24.187 --> 02:47:28.491]  If he wants to offer a free website, tell him to give me a call after the show and I'll be glad to talk to him.
[02:47:28.791 --> 02:47:29.451]  Okay.
[02:47:29.572 --> 02:47:30.552]  Are you in a phone book?
[02:47:30.592 --> 02:47:32.634]  I can just call information?
[02:47:32.854 --> 02:47:35.556]  Now, folks, don't call now, but Mr. Berg, I can give your phone number out.
[02:47:35.576 --> 02:47:35.716]  Sure.
[02:47:35.837 --> 02:47:36.217]  Yes, you can.
[02:47:37.430 --> 02:47:38.171]  Uh, which one?
[02:47:38.311 --> 02:47:38.791]  I've got a bunch.
[02:47:38.811 --> 02:47:39.111]  Give it 610-825-3134.
[02:47:39.132 --> 02:47:39.172]  610-825-3134.
[02:47:39.192 --> 02:47:39.272]  610-825-3134.
[02:47:39.292 --> 02:47:39.912]  That's correct.
[02:47:40.052 --> 02:47:43.575]  And the mail-in address, 706 Ridge Pike Lafayette Hill, Pennsylvania, 194444.
[02:47:43.635 --> 02:47:43.855]  Correct.
[02:47:43.955 --> 02:47:44.035]  Okay.
[02:47:44.055 --> 02:47:48.859]  And we've got a link to... John, I look forward to hearing from you.
[02:47:48.879 --> 02:47:48.979]  Okay.
[02:47:49.659 --> 02:47:50.020]  I'll call you.
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:50.580]  Thank you, John.
[02:48:05.059 --> 02:48:06.840]  Let's talk to Dan in New York.
[02:48:06.900 --> 02:48:07.680]  Dan, you're on the air.
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:08.140]  Go ahead.
[02:48:08.160 --> 02:48:10.801]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:48:11.341 --> 02:48:14.262]  Mr. Berg, if we could, if we have the courage, I have a couple of questions.
[02:48:14.842 --> 02:48:17.222]  Have you seen any of Alex Jones' videos at all?
[02:48:17.702 --> 02:48:18.103]  I'm sorry?
[02:48:18.363 --> 02:48:20.463]  Have you seen any of Alex Jones' videos?
[02:48:21.283 --> 02:48:22.384]  I'm not sure I saw that.
[02:48:22.424 --> 02:48:23.264]  I've seen a number of things.
[02:48:23.284 --> 02:48:26.685]  Whatever you have, make sure you get my number, give me a call, and make sure I get them.
[02:48:26.945 --> 02:48:28.745]  Alex, maybe you can give me some of your videos.
[02:48:28.905 --> 02:48:30.986]  I have seen Alex, and it's really
[02:48:31.724 --> 02:48:32.144]  Great.
[02:48:32.324 --> 02:48:33.604]  Yeah, because there's a lot of information.
[02:48:33.684 --> 02:48:37.325]  Secondly, Mr. Berg, have you ever heard of or talked to David Schiffer?
[02:48:38.345 --> 02:48:39.185]  What he knew about 9-11.
[02:48:39.205 --> 02:48:40.786]  Yeah, we had David Schiffer on.
[02:48:40.826 --> 02:48:44.626]  He knew beforehand, tried to warn Ashcroft he wouldn't talk to him.
[02:48:44.946 --> 02:48:48.367]  Then after 9-11, they were sent a letter threatening to arrest him if they kept talking.
[02:48:48.547 --> 02:48:53.388]  Yeah, there might be someone to get in touch with because, to me, he's a gentleman that has a lot of credentials, a lot of credibility.
[02:48:53.408 --> 02:48:54.128]  Yeah, he's out of Chicago.
[02:48:54.408 --> 02:48:56.928]  I haven't talked to him, but I have his name here and I will get in touch with him.
[02:48:57.028 --> 02:49:00.269]  Again, I can involve you guys in your courage, Mr. Berg and Alex, you too.
[02:49:01.161 --> 02:49:01.802]  Have a good afternoon.
[02:49:01.902 --> 02:49:02.822]  Thank you very much.
[02:49:02.902 --> 02:49:03.363]  You bet.
[02:49:03.383 --> 02:49:06.685]  He's another prosecutor, lawyer, like Mr. Berg.
[02:49:07.146 --> 02:49:07.366]  Great.
[02:49:08.287 --> 02:49:10.108]  So, okay, final segment with our guests.
[02:49:10.128 --> 02:49:13.831]  We'll take maybe one or two more calls, and I have to have you guys back on.
[02:49:14.031 --> 02:49:15.652]  We could do a whole other hour on this.
[02:49:16.313 --> 02:49:18.695]  Phillip, Ellen, are you guys game for that in the future?
[02:49:18.715 --> 02:49:19.175]  I sure am.
[02:49:19.375 --> 02:49:19.835]  Absolutely.
[02:49:19.855 --> 02:49:21.237]  With everyone else, we'll work with you.
[02:49:21.617 --> 02:49:23.778]  And when we get back, Ellen, I have no idea what you're going to say about it.
[02:49:23.839 --> 02:49:25.220]  I didn't know you'd seen Road to Tyranny.
[02:49:25.980 --> 02:49:28.342]  So we'll find out when you saw that, and I want to thank whoever gave you a copy.
[02:49:28.802 --> 02:49:29.543]  We'll be right back.
[02:49:29.583 --> 02:49:30.824]  Stay with us as we fight the tyranny.
[02:49:32.915 --> 02:49:37.258]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:49:37.438 --> 02:49:41.861]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:49:42.022 --> 02:49:46.385]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:49:46.425 --> 02:49:47.786]  The New World Order.
[02:49:48.446 --> 02:49:49.768]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:50:03.311 --> 02:50:13.633]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:50:13.913 --> 02:50:19.274]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:52:39.782 --> 02:52:41.643]  Ellen Mariani is our guest.
[02:52:41.703 --> 02:52:43.204]  Her lawyer is Philip J. Berg.
[02:52:44.104 --> 02:52:45.385]  Very articulate gentleman.
[02:52:45.985 --> 02:52:50.367]  The Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania.
[02:52:50.407 --> 02:53:07.514]  I mean, I knew the guy was smart and spot on when we were talking to him, but it's good to know that more and more prominent people, like Bob Dole's former Chief of Staff, David Shippers, Stanley Hilton, all these people are speaking up and even
[02:53:09.518 --> 02:53:13.122]  Dean is doing it now, but not in a very strong fashion.
[02:53:13.162 --> 02:53:14.883]  But if we don't expose this, it's over.
[02:53:15.924 --> 02:53:19.087]  One last call here that I'll have time to go to.
[02:53:19.427 --> 02:53:21.749]  Mark, what's the next call in line here?
[02:53:23.871 --> 02:53:26.053]  Don in North Carolina, last caller for our guest.
[02:53:26.093 --> 02:53:26.454]  Go ahead.
[02:53:28.816 --> 02:53:30.497]  Good to talk to you from North Carolina.
[02:53:30.517 --> 02:53:31.939]  Hi, Alex.
[02:53:31.959 --> 02:53:32.599]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:53:33.060 --> 02:53:35.442]  How can I get a hold of Mr. Burgeis?
[02:53:36.069 --> 02:53:50.601]  Pretty good information to pass on to these people and the families concerning the airlines themselves with some insider trading and some of the other individuals that we're moving about from Unocal and Chevron, Texeco and the United Airlines.
[02:53:50.741 --> 02:53:54.504]  I have some information on American Airlines too.
[02:53:54.564 --> 02:53:58.147]  I need to get in touch with Mr. Burke if there's a way I can do that.
[02:53:58.648 --> 02:53:59.368]  Okay.
[02:53:59.428 --> 02:54:00.469]  Well, we gave out his number.
[02:54:00.489 --> 02:54:01.090]  It'd be... Oops!
[02:54:01.710 --> 02:54:02.131]  I missed it.
[02:54:05.040 --> 02:54:05.100]  825-3134.
[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:05.240]  610-825-3134.
[02:54:05.380 --> 02:54:05.981]  Okay.
[02:54:06.001 --> 02:54:07.622]  Thank you, Don.
[02:54:07.802 --> 02:54:08.362]  Okay.
[02:54:08.563 --> 02:54:10.784]  I'll give you a call.
[02:54:10.844 --> 02:54:12.285]  Thank you, Don.
[02:54:13.006 --> 02:54:16.108]  I look forward to hearing from you.
[02:54:16.128 --> 02:54:16.508]  Okay.
[02:54:16.528 --> 02:54:16.789]  Bye-bye.
[02:54:18.250 --> 02:54:19.310]  You know, that's the key here.
[02:54:19.370 --> 02:54:23.133]  Get as much evidence out in front quickly as possible.
[02:54:23.193 --> 02:54:30.178]  That's why there's so many thousands of people prominently fighting them now that they're going to have trouble and they're losing credibility.
[02:54:30.218 --> 02:54:32.260]  How do you see this playing out, Mr. Berg?
[02:54:32.802 --> 02:54:41.846]  Well, I think the amazing response we received, even without the newspapers covering it yet or the major stations, and that's why I give credit and I thank you very much, Alex.
[02:54:41.966 --> 02:54:46.568]  You know, Alex Jones and other individuals like you are significant here and your listeners throughout the country.
[02:54:46.929 --> 02:54:51.851]  The more people that get involved, as Ellen said, contact your senators, contact your congressmen.
[02:54:52.324 --> 02:54:54.205]  Tell them that you're offended by what's going on.
[02:54:54.265 --> 02:54:56.606]  Demand the White House turn over these documentations.
[02:54:57.086 --> 02:54:57.926]  Get the word out there.
[02:54:57.966 --> 02:54:59.527]  Like this gentleman, Don, that just called.
[02:54:59.567 --> 02:55:00.607]  He has information.
[02:55:00.707 --> 02:55:06.429]  I think there's other individuals in this country that have information that have been afraid to come forth with it.
[02:55:06.890 --> 02:55:12.732]  And through you directly, you know, through you or directly to me, if we get this information, we can follow up on this information.
[02:55:13.254 --> 02:55:14.275]  We have the puzzle.
[02:55:15.175 --> 02:55:18.357]  I think the puzzle is complete, but let's say we have it 90% complete.
[02:55:18.677 --> 02:55:20.078]  We're looking for the other 10% here.
[02:55:20.198 --> 02:55:26.001]  I think there's no question here, and we together, the individuals together, that's how this country was founded.
[02:55:26.041 --> 02:55:31.284]  People stood up as individuals together and fought, and that's why we have the United States of America.
[02:55:31.604 --> 02:55:32.305]  Absolutely.
[02:55:32.885 --> 02:55:35.086]  And if we give up liberty for security, we get tyranny.
[02:55:35.126 --> 02:55:36.086]  That's a historical fact.
[02:55:36.146 --> 02:55:38.687]  Phillip Berg and Ellen.
[02:55:39.007 --> 02:55:46.889]  Ellen, I'm sorry for your husband's loss, but I know he's proud of you up in heaven, how you're standing up with more courage than most men in this country, and Godspeed to you.
[02:55:46.929 --> 02:55:48.490]  We'll be talking to you soon, and take care.
[02:55:48.810 --> 02:55:49.770]  Can I say one thing?
[02:55:49.790 --> 02:55:49.990]  Sure.
[02:55:50.370 --> 02:55:51.510]  Bring our people home.
[02:55:51.730 --> 02:55:53.151]  Bring all our armed forces home.
[02:55:53.251 --> 02:55:54.651]  They are over there on lives.
[02:55:54.791 --> 02:55:56.812]  We need them before their lives are gone also.
[02:55:57.526 --> 02:55:59.247]  They're over there breathing depleted uranium.
[02:55:59.507 --> 02:56:00.008]  Absolutely.
[02:56:00.048 --> 02:56:00.488]  Take care.
[02:56:00.788 --> 02:56:00.948]  Bye-bye.
[02:56:00.968 --> 02:56:01.169]  Thank you.
[02:56:01.209 --> 02:56:02.229]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:56:02.249 --> 02:56:02.790]  My pleasure.
[02:56:02.970 --> 02:56:05.071]  Thank you for coming on and having the courage.
[02:56:05.131 --> 02:56:05.972]  Please don't thank me.
[02:56:05.992 --> 02:56:06.572]  You're wonderful.
[02:56:07.153 --> 02:56:15.299]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, right here on this network at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, down at your local AM or FM station.
[02:56:15.379 --> 02:56:18.601]  Thank them for their courage in being part of the second 1776.
[02:56:18.661 --> 02:56:20.302]  Support the sponsors.
[02:56:20.823 --> 02:56:22.164]  I'll be in Houston December 13th.
[02:56:24.082 --> 02:56:25.223]  From 6 p.m.
[02:56:25.323 --> 02:56:26.263]  to around midnight.
[02:56:26.843 --> 02:56:29.925]  Showing Road to Tyranny and another film.
[02:56:31.065 --> 02:56:31.665]  That's right.
[02:56:31.705 --> 02:56:32.666]  Something you need to see.
[02:56:32.946 --> 02:56:33.806]  They Live.
[02:56:34.027 --> 02:56:35.047]  And I'll give a speech.
[02:56:35.227 --> 02:56:36.908]  Great place to meet like-minded people.
[02:56:36.948 --> 02:56:39.309]  The West Oak Shopping Center in Houston, Texas.
[02:56:40.850 --> 02:56:42.690]  Be sure and be there and bring your friends and family.
[02:56:42.710 --> 02:56:45.872]  Hope to see you there in Houston two Saturdays from now.
[02:56:47.213 --> 02:56:58.479]  Get my new film Matrix of Evil, get Masters of Terror, get Police State 3 Total Enslavement, get the new book Order Out of Chaos, go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order, if you believe in this show and what we're doing, or call toll free.
[02:56:59.180 --> 02:57:01.321]  I meant to ask her about how she saw Road to Tyranny.
[02:57:01.441 --> 02:57:02.282]  I'm going to have her back up.
[02:57:02.442 --> 02:57:04.083]  I bet you she saw it and woke her up.
[02:57:05.527 --> 02:57:06.008]  Amazing.
[02:57:06.408 --> 02:57:07.529]  But whoever gave it to her.
[02:57:07.549 --> 02:57:08.690]  See, you gave her a copy, folks.
[02:57:08.710 --> 02:57:09.151]  Good job.
[02:57:09.231 --> 02:57:10.933]  Do it to other people.
[02:57:10.953 --> 02:57:15.397]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:57:16.518 --> 02:57:17.159]  Make that call.
[02:57:17.199 --> 02:57:17.900]  Go to the website.
[02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:18.480]  Write the letter.
[02:57:18.761 --> 02:57:19.401]  Get the films.
[02:57:20.242 --> 02:57:21.363]  See you back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:57:21.403 --> 02:57:22.324]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:57:23.165 --> 02:57:26.428]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:57:26.488 --> 02:57:30.653]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:57:30.933 --> 02:57:33.656]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
