[00:01:55.885 --> 00:01:58.085]  And of course, you won't hear this on our news.
[00:01:58.125 --> 00:01:59.285]  Of course, maybe you will now.
[00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:01.686]  They say, torture is an American virtue.

[00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:25.315]  I wanted to go back to this headline about the mass graves and incinerators for you and your family from the Rocky Mountain News because it isn't just for the Muslims overseas.
[00:02:25.796 --> 00:02:29.118]  It's for you if the globalists get away with what they're planning to set up.

[00:04:07.381 --> 00:04:14.045]  That's right, they come right out with it in the Chicago sometimes and say, there's a massive cover-up going on.
[00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:15.465]  What did the president know?
[00:04:15.546 --> 00:04:16.306]  When did he know it?
[00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:21.589]  Syrian leader questions Al-Qaeda existence, thinks it's a made-up CIA creation.
[00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:22.970]  No kidding!
[00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.373]  Also, the best connected investor in America is the Carlisle Group.

[00:05:00.211 --> 00:05:02.995]  Folks, believe me, I haven't covered a third of it.
[00:05:03.075 --> 00:05:05.679]  It's all coming up in detail and some guests.
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.703]  You'll want to stay with me and it's online at InfoWars.com.
[00:05:10.532 --> 00:05:12.154]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[00:06:17.478 --> 00:06:18.839]  That's right folks, DVD.

[00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:20.465]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:21.085 --> 00:08:21.886]  All right, folks.
[00:08:22.266 --> 00:08:29.270]  Big, big, big show lined up for you on this 27th of May, 2003, worldwide edition.
[00:08:34.182 --> 00:08:37.203]  The headlines, again I was just mentioning some of them, U.S.
[00:08:37.243 --> 00:08:38.623]  plans death camp.
[00:08:38.763 --> 00:08:48.184]  That's the headline out of the Sunday Mail, one of the big national papers of Australia, and of course they're just reporting on other European papers.
[00:08:48.765 --> 00:08:49.145]  The U.S.
[00:08:49.185 --> 00:08:55.346]  has floated plans to turn Guantanamo Bay into a death camp with its own death row and execution chamber.
[00:08:55.786 --> 00:09:02.527]  Prisoners would be tried, convicted, and executed without leaving its boundaries, without a jury, and without a right of appeal.
[00:09:03.207 --> 00:09:15.436]  A mail on Sunday newspaper reported yesterday the plans were revealed by Major General Jeffrey Miller who was in charge of the 680 suspects from 43 countries including two Australians.
[00:09:15.856 --> 00:09:20.520]  The suspects have been held at Camp Delta on Cuba without charge for 18 months.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:29.086]  General Miller said building a death row was one plan, another was to have a permanent jail with the possibility of an execution chamber.
[00:09:30.493 --> 00:09:42.141]  Now, in this article, and by the way, this was Reuters picking up the story out of the Sunday Mail, the Mail on Sunday, no one ever connects the dots.
[00:09:43.502 --> 00:09:47.545]  Brigadier General Rick Baucus resigned last year.
[00:09:47.625 --> 00:09:50.968]  The New York Post, the New York Daily News reported on it.
[00:09:51.388 --> 00:09:56.572]  So did some of the Rhode Island papers, but that's the only places we saw it, because General Baucus lives in Rhode Island.
[00:09:57.916 --> 00:10:01.757]  He refused to torture the young people.
[00:10:02.077 --> 00:10:04.278]  It was too much for him to handle.
[00:10:05.218 --> 00:10:07.719]  He complained and he said he was going to resign.
[00:10:07.739 --> 00:10:09.399]  And so they said, go ahead, resign.
[00:10:09.439 --> 00:10:11.880]  And then when he began to resign, they fired him.
[00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:13.440]  Different articles said he resigned.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.321]  Others said he was relieved of command.
[00:10:15.341 --> 00:10:17.182]  Brigadier General.
[00:10:17.522 --> 00:10:20.262]  So that's the type of stuff going on there at the base.
[00:10:20.422 --> 00:10:25.664]  Now, our government also admits, it's not the government, it's the Global Crime Syndicate, but it calls itself the government.
[00:10:26.244 --> 00:10:28.485]  That it is torturing people to death.
[00:10:28.525 --> 00:10:32.007]  This is confirmed, admitted by the Pentagon, in Afghanistan.
[00:10:32.387 --> 00:10:44.432]  The Washington Post reported what the CIA said, the section chief in the Middle East, that they fly people to Jordan and Egypt for torture and quote, where their children and families can be threatened.
[00:10:44.832 --> 00:10:49.655]  We then saw all the newscast a few months ago about, is torturing children good?
[00:10:50.055 --> 00:10:51.075]  Should we do it?
[00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:53.496]  And the pundits all said, absolutely.
[00:10:53.936 --> 00:10:54.857]  It's wonderful.
[00:10:55.726 --> 00:11:01.590]  In fact, we have a few clips of that in my film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, along with the news articles.
[00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:06.194]  That's about 3 minutes of the 2-hour, 37-minute film to give you an idea of what's in this video.
[00:11:06.294 --> 00:11:09.136]  It's so jam-packed with stuff like that.
[00:11:09.896 --> 00:11:13.219]  Just proving the criminality here, and someone will say, hey, these are evil people.
[00:11:13.259 --> 00:11:15.360]  Well, if they're evil, we've got proof.
[00:11:15.861 --> 00:11:19.603]  Then show it to a jury, and they will give them the death penalty.
[00:11:19.623 --> 00:11:21.865]  But do not have it through a military tribunal.
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.502]  And also, torture's wrong, folks.
[00:11:25.542 --> 00:11:27.543]  You may say, torture's okay for these people.
[00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:33.867]  Well, was it okay when our troops, when our sailors and airmen and marines got captured by the North Vietnamese Communists?
[00:11:34.327 --> 00:11:36.969]  No, it was wrong then, and it's wrong now.
[00:11:37.489 --> 00:11:40.091]  And you can't trust any confession you get from torture.
[00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:42.653]  You can't trust a government that will torture.
[00:11:43.173 --> 00:11:45.835]  And on top of it, my friends, our government
[00:11:46.912 --> 00:12:00.536]  That is, the compartmentalized shadow government ran 9-1-1 and controls Al-Qaeda and Taliban, founded both groups, and flew 8,000 of them out to safety in the middle of the war, right before the fall of Kandahar and Kabul.
[00:12:01.776 --> 00:12:05.659]  Out to safety in Pakistan and paid them.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.181]  Same thing happened with the Iraqi leadership.
[00:12:08.421 --> 00:12:11.784]  Admitted, calmly in the back of the paper, with Iraq.
[00:12:12.144 --> 00:12:13.305]  Gold bars.
[00:12:13.525 --> 00:12:24.374]  The same story that's in 9-1-1, the road to tyranny about September 11th in Afghanistan is mirrored, is repeated in what's happening today.
[00:12:25.415 --> 00:12:25.715]  U.S.
[00:12:25.775 --> 00:12:27.136]  plans death camp.
[00:12:27.156 --> 00:12:28.077]  That's the headline.
[00:12:28.577 --> 00:12:29.598]  Death camp.
[00:12:31.093 --> 00:12:49.035]  Now, under the Model States of Emergency Powers Act that was federally passed in 2002 as part of Homeland Security, you can be executed for any reason at these relocation centers, these emergency cities with barbed wire fences around them.
[00:12:50.373 --> 00:13:13.122]  In my film, The Takeover, made in 2000, I have video off of local news and articles and our own video where they admit the old 747 hangar at the old airport, Mueller, Robert Mueller Airport, has been put barbed wire, uh, fence, armored vehicles, cots, thousands of cots, hundreds of port-a-potties, bolts and chains to chain you down to the floor,
[00:13:13.977 --> 00:13:20.814]  They'll do all this, folks, to set the precedent that they're in absolute control unless we speak out and say no.
[00:13:20.874 --> 00:13:22.599]  I know it sounds scary, but it's the truth.
[00:13:24.196 --> 00:13:25.837]  So, we'll get more into this article, U.S.
[00:13:25.877 --> 00:13:27.539]  plans death camps, later in the show.
[00:13:27.959 --> 00:13:37.506]  Red Cross denied access to POWs, London Guardian, up to 3,000 Iraqis, some of them civilians, believed to be gagged, bound, hooded, and beaten at U.S.
[00:13:37.526 --> 00:13:39.528]  camps close to Baghdad airport.
[00:13:39.988 --> 00:13:49.936]  The United States is illegally holding thousands of Iraqi prisoners of war and other captives without access to human rights officials as compounds close to Baghdad airport, the Observer has learned.
[00:13:51.135 --> 00:13:57.121]  There have also been reports of a mutiny last week by prisoners in an airport compound in protest against conditions.
[00:13:57.642 --> 00:14:01.205]  The uprising was dealt with by the Americans according to a U.S.
[00:14:01.245 --> 00:14:01.926]  military source.
[00:14:01.946 --> 00:14:05.309]  The International Committee for the Red Cross so far has been denied access.
[00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:10.975]  What the organization believes could be as many as 3,000 prisoners held in the searing heat.
[00:14:11.727 --> 00:14:18.449]  And we have photos of them in this camp, fathers with hoods over their heads, tied around their heads with babies laying in the sun.
[00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:21.270]  We're talking three-year-olds, two-year-olds who's baking.
[00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:23.130]  They say they're dying of dysentery.
[00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.871]  They're taking out body bags daily.
[00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:26.711]  It's all part of the love.
[00:14:28.252 --> 00:14:36.014]  All other requests to inspect conditions under which the prisoners are being held have been met with silence or have been turned down.
[00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:45.070]  There is circumstantial evidence that prisoners are being gagged and hooded in the manner of the Afghans and other captives held at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
[00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:48.153]  Treatment itself questionable under international law.
[00:14:48.614 --> 00:14:52.479]  Unlike the Afghans in Cuba, there is no doubt about the status of these captives.
[00:14:53.519 --> 00:14:54.460]  Well, my friends,
[00:15:18.445 --> 00:15:28.393]  This is so horrible and it's only going to get worse and MSNBC reported before the war plans for re-education centers.
[00:15:29.574 --> 00:15:36.679]  Re-education centers, movie screens, blaring propaganda, machine gun nests, everything!
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.062]  This is so embarrassing.
[00:15:40.791 --> 00:15:44.954]  But again, Europe controls America, is using us as the bad cop right now.
[00:15:45.314 --> 00:15:46.575]  They own our Federal Reserve.
[00:15:46.635 --> 00:15:48.916]  They've ordered the dollar to be imploded.
[00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:52.819]  They've ordered the de-industrialization of this country.
[00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:55.281]  They've ordered the police state to be set up.
[00:15:55.881 --> 00:15:57.742]  And you reap what you sow, America.
[00:15:57.822 --> 00:15:59.603]  It's all going to come back on you.
[00:16:00.944 --> 00:16:05.187]  And out of all our concentration camp stories, we posted some of them again yesterday.
[00:16:05.207 --> 00:16:08.149]  Here's the one out of the Rocky Mountain News, February 8, 2003.
[00:16:11.033 --> 00:16:11.994]  Jim Erickson.
[00:16:12.414 --> 00:16:14.696]  Executive orders give Governor additional powers.
[00:16:14.737 --> 00:16:24.486]  The state of Colorado could seize antibiotics, cremate disease-ridden corpses under extreme circumstances, dig mass graves under executive orders drafted for use in the event of a bioterrorism attack.
[00:16:25.066 --> 00:16:32.573]  Eight of the executive orders have been drafted since the mid-2001 by the Governor's Expert Emergency Epidemic Response Committee.
[00:16:33.634 --> 00:16:36.737]  And it goes on to say that
[00:16:37.731 --> 00:16:44.133]  The nightmare scenarios include planes flying over a stadium and releasing an aerosol germ with a smallpox replugged and infects thousands of people.
[00:16:44.753 --> 00:16:50.455]  It goes on to say mass graves and incinerators have been prepared.
[00:16:51.035 --> 00:16:52.616]  Incinerators.
[00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:53.476]  Let me say that again.
[00:16:54.036 --> 00:16:55.417]  Incinerators.
[00:16:56.217 --> 00:16:57.758]  Incinerators.
[00:16:58.578 --> 00:16:59.878]  Incinerators.
[00:17:00.539 --> 00:17:01.839]  Mass graves.
[00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:11.110]  And they say it's not a question of it, but when it's going to happen, as Gary Hart smiles on Fox News, Denver, Cleveland, and Dallas, he says, will be hit.
[00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:13.693]  We're going to take all your rights away.
[00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:15.476]  We're going to have troops in all the factories.
[00:17:15.496 --> 00:17:17.198]  You're all going to be watched and controlled.
[00:17:18.422 --> 00:17:26.204]  By the way, Senator Warner said three, four months ago that he wanted drones watching our every move with sensors that look through walls.
[00:17:26.604 --> 00:17:35.106]  That was a backlash, and they said, oh, it's for the illegals on the border, which we know isn't true, and they, up in Pennsylvania, just caught a truck full of people being smuggled.
[00:17:35.606 --> 00:17:40.327]  At a seatbelt checkpoint, citizens were being arrested and ticketed and having their cars searched.
[00:17:40.347 --> 00:17:44.168]  The illegals were ordered released by the Fed, so it's not about illegals.
[00:17:44.728 --> 00:17:53.070]  Now they admit, oh, they're going to have a Pentagon program with drones over your cities, but it's just to watch traffic congestion.
[00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:54.770]  Oh, yes!
[00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.511]  And all the cameras are for that, too.
[00:17:59.251 --> 00:18:00.832]  See how this works, folks?
[00:18:01.072 --> 00:18:02.132]  Drones.
[00:18:02.432 --> 00:18:03.132]  Drones.
[00:18:03.312 --> 00:18:04.072]  Like out of a movie.
[00:18:04.132 --> 00:18:06.573]  They live watching you.
[00:18:09.033 --> 00:18:09.995]  Doesn't intimidate me.
[00:18:10.035 --> 00:18:15.563]  It makes me very angry that we don't expose who's behind the terror and how the globalists are using terror.
[00:18:16.124 --> 00:18:18.287]  It's over for this society.
[00:18:18.945 --> 00:18:20.667]  They want to re-engineer the society.
[00:18:20.707 --> 00:18:24.750]  They want you in compact, police-state, cashless, control-grid cities.
[00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.632]  They want you off the private property in the country.
[00:18:27.652 --> 00:18:29.514]  And they're going to use terror to do it.
[00:18:29.574 --> 00:18:38.622]  And if you don't mobilize and educate now, and say no to this now, and if you don't refuse the national ID card through your digital driver's license with a thumb scan or the face scan,
[00:18:39.302 --> 00:18:42.123]  If you don't say no to the grocery stores, put the thumb scanners in.
[00:18:42.403 --> 00:18:56.689]  If you don't say no to the police state and the Patriot Act and all the rest of this trash, and if you don't boycott and resist and speak out as Republicans or Democrats or Libertarians or whatever you are, it's over for this society.
[00:18:58.689 --> 00:19:01.110]  This is their smoke screen for martial law, folks.
[00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:05.852]  That's all the terror is, and they'll supply whatever level of terror needed to get that job done.
[00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:10.020]  I want to take calls early in this hour.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:10.800]  We will do it.
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:12.841]  Do you have any comments about any of this news?
[00:19:13.261 --> 00:19:16.262]  We're live on this Tuesday edition, the 27th of February.
[00:19:16.282 --> 00:19:18.343]  I've been looking at this article since February.
[00:19:19.024 --> 00:19:19.764]  Of May.
[00:19:19.824 --> 00:19:20.664]  Yes, it's May.
[00:19:20.684 --> 00:19:21.024]  The 27th of May, 2003.
[00:19:21.064 --> 00:19:23.646]  The toll free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:23.666 --> 00:19:23.906]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:42.959]  1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:19:42.979 --> 00:19:43.239]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:47.944]  Here's the Cincinnati Enquirer.
[00:19:48.125 --> 00:19:50.587]  Drone Research looks at traffic applications.
[00:19:50.968 --> 00:19:53.270]  They can guide emergency crews, ease jams.
[00:19:53.971 --> 00:19:55.573]  Isn't that nice of them?
[00:19:57.342 --> 00:20:08.992]  But when they catch a truckload of illegals crammed in there at a checkpoint with their arresting citizens and searching vehicles as part of the FEMA seatbelt smoke screen, they release the illegals.
[00:20:10.524 --> 00:20:17.386]  As a listener to the Genesis Communications Network, you're aware of the many health dangers that have been unleashed upon an unsuspecting public.
[00:20:17.826 --> 00:20:24.967]  We all want to protect ourselves and our loved ones, but how do we do that without costly pharmaceutical products that trade benefits with side effects?
[00:20:25.427 --> 00:20:29.228]  Stabilized oxygen may be just the answer to this question and more.
[00:20:29.608 --> 00:20:36.990]  Stabilized oxygen is an oxidant similar to food-grade hydrogen peroxide, but it is more stable and effective with no unpleasant taste.
[00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:46.680]  By providing your bloodstream with molecular oxygen, it is possible to kill anaerobic bacteria and other parasites on contact without harming tissue or friendly bacteria.
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:50.664]  A 120-day supply of stabilized oxygen is just $15 post-pay.
[00:20:52.532 --> 00:21:02.436]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your four month supply and get the best oxygen boost available in easy to take droplet form.
[00:21:02.836 --> 00:21:04.336]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com
[00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:11.119]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:11.499 --> 00:21:17.223]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:21:17.483 --> 00:21:22.626]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:22.966 --> 00:21:32.232]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:21:32.592 --> 00:21:37.557]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:21:37.877 --> 00:21:41.901]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:21:42.101 --> 00:21:46.885]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:21:47.266 --> 00:21:53.111]  Emergy Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:21:53.471 --> 00:21:59.694]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:59.734 --> 00:22:00.715]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:00.735 --> 00:22:01.675]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:09.463 --> 00:22:12.086]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:22:12.327 --> 00:22:18.074]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:22:18.314 --> 00:22:19.676]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:22:19.776 --> 00:22:23.481]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[00:22:23.621 --> 00:22:24.582]  You still use either meat
[00:22:24.602 --> 00:22:25.443]  We're good to go!
[00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:55.503]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley, Sunday evenings at 6 p.m.

[00:23:06.087 --> 00:23:08.148]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[00:23:09.429 --> 00:23:11.331]  Your beliefs and opinions are attacked constantly.
[00:23:11.611 --> 00:23:15.595]  Media, press, and government support even perpetrate lies to degrade your rights and independence.
[00:23:15.815 --> 00:23:19.519]  The liberally biased populist assaults your mind in order to take advantage of your soul.
[00:23:19.779 --> 00:23:22.601]  Fight back every day with the 2003 Freedom Calendar.
[00:23:22.722 --> 00:23:24.603]  Available by calling MIDAS Resources at 1-800.

[00:23:28.845 --> 00:23:30.726]  Government should only exist to protect those rights.
[00:23:30.966 --> 00:23:32.627]  This calendar affirms your ideals.
[00:23:32.827 --> 00:23:35.268]  It shows you where your rights are protected in the Constitution.

[00:23:42.411 --> 00:23:43.031]  Know your rights.
[00:23:43.231 --> 00:23:45.372]  The rights that will save you from a corrupted Republic.
[00:23:45.572 --> 00:23:46.772]  We want you to spread the word.
[00:23:46.992 --> 00:23:49.773]  Prices decrease significantly when the quantity ordered is increased.
[00:23:49.933 --> 00:23:50.473]  Call now.

[00:23:51.074 --> 00:23:54.935]  Unity is the only way to overcome.

[00:23:57.055 --> 00:23:59.456]  The very rights our government was created to protect.
[00:23:59.636 --> 00:24:02.257]  The Freedom Calendar is available now at Midas Resources.
[00:24:02.277 --> 00:24:02.537]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:02.577 --> 00:24:04.357]  Get it now and start spreading the truth.
[00:24:14.196 --> 00:24:16.917]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:16.937 --> 00:24:27.021]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:29.582 --> 00:24:32.884]  Alright folks, again it's Tuesday, the 27th of May, 2003.
[00:24:33.804 --> 00:24:34.604]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:24:34.804 --> 00:24:35.765]  I love this country.
[00:24:35.885 --> 00:24:37.065]  I love the Second Amendment.
[00:24:37.485 --> 00:24:38.586]  I love our sovereignty.
[00:24:38.726 --> 00:24:40.066]  I love the red, white, and blue.
[00:24:40.587 --> 00:24:43.448]  And the enemies of America have stolen our symbols.
[00:24:44.298 --> 00:24:51.521]  And they're using them to throw them in our face and tell us, oh, be a patriot, go along with tyranny, destroy the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:24:51.561 --> 00:24:58.403]  But America is awakening, which means the globalists are going to supply more terror to scare us into submission.
[00:24:58.423 --> 00:25:08.347]  If we don't get the message out of who's behind this terror, and the history of government-sponsored terrorism, and the Hegelian dialectic of problem, reaction, solution, it's over for this society.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:16.786]  The total free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:17.206 --> 00:25:21.150]  Coming up, Homeland Security buys New Mexico Town for training with the Marines.
[00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.672]  Euro hits record high versus the dollar.
[00:25:23.712 --> 00:25:24.993]  That's record from last week.
[00:25:25.493 --> 00:25:27.775]  Six Americans killed in Iraq in two days.
[00:25:28.115 --> 00:25:33.300]  Soldiers may sue over Iraq War Syndrome as they war vaccine poison dust Gulf War
[00:25:34.101 --> 00:25:38.014]  That's two syndrome after British soldiers given multiple vaccines fall ill.
[00:25:38.355 --> 00:25:40.001]  Thousands caught in crackdown.

[00:26:17.855 --> 00:26:29.440]  Portugal's spiraling pedophilia scandal has threatened to engulf the nation's elite after the arrest of a top politician and the warning from judges that the arrest of more members of parliament could be imminent.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.340]  Oh yes!
[00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:33.582]  Probe into happy pill after spat of suicides.
[00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:41.755]  Vows to pressure over Prozac and what it's causing, the people killing themselves, killing others.

[00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:02.431]  More on the Bilderberg Group.
[00:27:03.539 --> 00:27:06.501]  Big Jim Tucker and Christopher Bolin have now filed their reports.
[00:27:06.521 --> 00:27:09.883]  We can give you more details about the shadow government meeting a few weeks ago.
[00:27:11.143 --> 00:27:13.024]  Declining birth rates affecting Europe.
[00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:15.726]  Some of their cities have lost half their population.
[00:27:15.766 --> 00:27:18.347]  Everything's falling apart there in this culture of death.
[00:27:18.868 --> 00:27:22.329]  Al Qaeda's summer plans, government fear-mongering, saying they're sure to attack.

[00:27:28.273 --> 00:27:29.633]  It's all coming up.
[00:27:29.753 --> 00:27:30.294]  Big show!
[00:27:31.033 --> 00:27:32.816]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[00:27:32.936 --> 00:27:35.319]  Let's talk to John in Georgia.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:36.681]  John, you're on the air.
[00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:37.342]  Welcome, sir.
[00:27:38.524 --> 00:27:46.976]  Hey, I just wanted to say that this weekend during the statewide ticket campaign, I noticed in Macon, Georgia,
[00:27:47.748 --> 00:27:56.114]  That a local volunteer group that operates under the EMA was also involved in the road check and they were checking people.
[00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:59.116]  So do these people have police powers if they're volunteers?
[00:27:59.536 --> 00:28:01.737]  Sir, have you seen Police State 2000?
[00:28:02.278 --> 00:28:02.838]  No, I haven't.
[00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:06.301]  Okay, it's a two-hour, five-minute film made in 1999.
[00:28:09.484 --> 00:28:18.586]  And we have video of I-35 shut down for 15 miles, took an hour and a half to get through it, giant searchlights, people being arrested, cars being searched.
[00:28:19.267 --> 00:28:26.689]  It was, we then learned the name of it, it was the National Seat Belt Use Initiative, funded by Clinton to the tune of over $4 billion a year.
[00:28:31.782 --> 00:28:40.234]  It's going to build internal checkpoints that will also serve as toll booths to fund it.
[00:28:40.735 --> 00:28:42.938]  It will be the equivalent of airport screening.
[00:28:42.978 --> 00:28:43.840]  You'll be harassed.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.661]  You'll be searched.
[00:28:45.041 --> 00:28:48.402]  That's why they don't care if you refuse to fly, you're going to go through it at the checkpoints.
[00:28:48.802 --> 00:28:54.444]  And it says, citizens will wear grey uniforms, part three of the four-part plan.
[00:28:54.944 --> 00:28:56.925]  Citizens will wear grey uniforms.
[00:28:57.285 --> 00:28:59.486]  There will be a national draft, compulsory draft.
[00:28:59.506 --> 00:29:01.426]  You will have to serve in Homeland Security.
[00:29:01.767 --> 00:29:04.007]  It will be high school students to be able to graduate.
[00:29:04.267 --> 00:29:06.008]  They will be searching you at checkpoints.
[00:29:06.548 --> 00:29:11.732]  The Philadelphia Inquirer reported last year that the kids are training with M16s.
[00:29:12.393 --> 00:29:17.056]  They're training in warrant service, checkpoints, fugitive apprehension, building clearing.
[00:29:17.496 --> 00:29:23.281]  It is going to be throngs of power-tripping citizens with sub-machine guns.
[00:29:24.582 --> 00:29:25.863]  It's a nightmare world, sir.
[00:29:25.903 --> 00:29:26.783]  How does it sound to you?
[00:29:26.803 --> 00:29:28.745]  Sounds just like the Khmer Rouge.
[00:29:31.514 --> 00:29:32.034]  Hold over.
[00:29:32.094 --> 00:29:34.595]  Tell us more about what happened in Georgia when we get back.
[00:29:34.675 --> 00:29:41.698]  Yeah, this clicker ticket you notice is being run through the Amber Alert billboards, federal and state billboards, radio and TV.
[00:29:42.458 --> 00:29:44.299]  It's phasing you into the new system.
[00:29:45.099 --> 00:29:49.721]  And I documented it all in Police State 2000, produced in early 1999.
[00:29:50.902 --> 00:29:52.042]  Well, released in 99.
[00:29:52.522 --> 00:29:54.663]  Really produced in 1998 and the 99.
[00:29:54.743 --> 00:29:56.924]  It's all coming up.
[00:29:57.044 --> 00:29:57.504]  Stay there.
[00:29:57.544 --> 00:29:58.765]  We'll talk more about hell on earth.
[00:30:00.663 --> 00:30:03.650]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.592 --> 00:30:07.258]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.971]  Hey gang, it's time for a fresh, healthy start.
[00:30:13.131 --> 00:30:16.613]  Take charge and lose that unwanted fat with Vim and Vigorous Collagenate.
[00:30:16.793 --> 00:30:18.734]  You know, collagenate's different than the other stuff.
[00:30:18.894 --> 00:30:23.176]  Vim and Vigorous Collagenate works with your body to improve... 887-2063.
[00:30:24.317 --> 00:30:27.018]  Isn't it time you stopped flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[00:30:27.038 --> 00:30:27.098]  1-888-887-2063.
[00:30:36.602 --> 00:30:38.503]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:30:38.983 --> 00:30:41.764]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:49.686 --> 00:30:54.867]  John in Georgia called in the last few minutes of the last segment.
[00:30:55.387 --> 00:30:57.408]  Well, I had him on air the last few minutes of the last segment.
[00:30:58.448 --> 00:31:00.969]  And he said in Georgia they had a citizens group
[00:31:02.558 --> 00:31:06.942]  On the news, out at the checkpoints, helping to look for people not wearing seatbelts.
[00:31:07.402 --> 00:31:09.043]  And they've had thousands of checkpoints.
[00:31:09.083 --> 00:31:12.526]  Every state, they wanted on average to have like 2,000 checkpoints.
[00:31:12.646 --> 00:31:15.048]  Now, John hung up.
[00:31:15.088 --> 00:31:15.909]  I wanted him to hold over.
[00:31:15.929 --> 00:31:16.969]  I wanted to hear more about it.
[00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:23.875]  But what I was saying was that in my film, Police Day 2000, the film starts with a giant checkpoint on I-35.
[00:31:24.736 --> 00:31:28.799]  Hundreds of police, state, local, federal, federally funded,
[00:31:29.839 --> 00:31:33.741]  And, look, the government knows you're not going to accept internal checkpoints overnight.
[00:31:33.821 --> 00:31:44.846]  So they said in Part 3 of the National Seat Belt Initiative Program, with billions of dollars of funding a year, that it was about getting you ready for internal checkpoints, internal toll booths.
[00:31:45.546 --> 00:31:45.766]  Okay?
[00:31:45.786 --> 00:31:49.968]  They're going to fund the checkpoints with the internal toll booths.
[00:31:50.989 --> 00:31:57.832]  And on top of it, they say they're going to have citizens, AmeriCorps, people to graduate from high school.
[00:31:59.004 --> 00:32:03.446]  to out there and basically man the checkpoints free of charge.
[00:32:04.406 --> 00:32:06.727]  And I asked the caller, I said, what does this sound like?
[00:32:06.767 --> 00:32:09.468]  And John said, sounds like the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
[00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:17.631]  Folks, this is the new America, and they've got this new draft law where men and women will have to serve, but you don't have to serve overseas.
[00:32:17.991 --> 00:32:26.734]  You can serve domestically in Homeland Security, and it lists warrant service, fugitive apprehension, checkpoints, safety checks, building clearing.
[00:32:28.183 --> 00:32:29.404]  So we have their plan.
[00:32:29.664 --> 00:32:31.046]  We know what it'll be like.
[00:32:31.806 --> 00:32:35.650]  And driving up to Kansas City, Missouri a few weeks ago for an expo there...
[00:32:37.615 --> 00:32:59.361]  I had a chance to drive back through the internal checkpoints with the police, the state police set up, the hardened checkpoints doubling as a toll booth, highway separators where you cannot exit off into any of the towns, you've got to exit to their gas stations, and McDonald's has got the contract, that's the only restaurant for 200 and something miles.
[00:33:00.202 --> 00:33:04.803]  This is the new America, and they're saying to get into cities, you're going to have to pay a toll.
[00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:10.898]  The satellite tracker boxes are already in your cars, ready for the interface to be plugged in.
[00:33:11.038 --> 00:33:11.918]  All the new cars.
[00:33:13.879 --> 00:33:14.820]  It's here, folks.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:15.480]  It's coming.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.221]  You've got to stand up against this.
[00:33:17.581 --> 00:33:25.346]  And I read the article last week, out of Pennsylvania, where they have the checkpoints.
[00:33:26.084 --> 00:33:39.295]  And it said one police chief was mad because they gave out hundreds of tickets, dozens of arrests, searched cars while they were at it under federal direction, took people to jail, found guns, found drugs, you know, all the usual stuff.
[00:33:39.756 --> 00:33:49.584]  But they caught a van packed full of illegals with an alien smuggler driving and were ordered to release them by the federal government.
[00:33:52.367 --> 00:34:00.192]  And now I'm reading an article here where they're going to have drones watching you, and no, it's not for the illegals, it's for you and your family, as we told you it would be.
[00:34:00.232 --> 00:34:02.333]  That's what Senator Warner called for.
[00:34:03.774 --> 00:34:09.737]  But I hear so-called neocon conservative radio saying, oh, drones are great, they're going to stop the illegals.
[00:34:09.777 --> 00:34:14.220]  Here in Texas, in 1993, Clinton signed the executive order.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:15.341]  Texas adopted it.
[00:34:15.381 --> 00:34:18.422]  If we wanted our highway funds, put the thumb scanners in by 94.
[00:34:19.873 --> 00:34:22.996]  They said, oh, Lamar Smith said it's to stop the illegals.
[00:34:23.456 --> 00:34:28.120]  But the illegals were given a waiver where they didn't have to show a birth certificate or thumb scan.
[00:34:28.641 --> 00:34:31.523]  You see, folks, it's about enslaving you.
[00:34:32.704 --> 00:34:34.026]  So more on that coming up.
[00:34:34.706 --> 00:34:39.330]  More on this incredible headline where they talk about the camps.
[00:34:39.651 --> 00:34:39.971]  U.S.
[00:34:40.011 --> 00:34:41.092]  plans death camp.
[00:34:41.132 --> 00:34:42.053]  That's the headline.
[00:34:42.473 --> 00:34:43.334]  More on that.
[00:34:43.394 --> 00:34:46.537]  But first, some of your calls.
[00:34:47.473 --> 00:34:54.034]  We're about to go to John in England, Rob in Wyoming, Bob in New York, Clint in Missouri, and others.
[00:34:54.135 --> 00:35:00.936]  But before I do that, let me just briefly tell you about New Millennium Concepts.
[00:35:02.196 --> 00:35:06.317]  Folks, they're the national distributor of British Birkfeld filters.
[00:35:06.477 --> 00:35:10.478]  That means you get a lower price because you're getting them basically a wholesale price.
[00:35:11.138 --> 00:35:14.439]  Try to buy one in the store, it's $50 more on average, depending on the unit.
[00:35:16.064 --> 00:35:19.706]  You also support this show because they're one of our biggest and best sponsors.
[00:35:20.427 --> 00:35:33.155]  And they've come out with a new filter, the Berkey Light, with lights and four sports filter bottles, or potassium iodate bottles.
[00:35:33.755 --> 00:35:37.117]  Just an amazing deal that you can get there.
[00:35:37.938 --> 00:35:39.919]  It is so important that you do this.
[00:35:39.959 --> 00:35:44.342]  But folks, they've got a new deal today that really is incredible.
[00:35:45.606 --> 00:35:57.470]  The Berkey Light, that has two filters, will do tens of thousands of gallons in its lifetime, the highest standard in gravity water filter systems, is normally, by itself, 199.
[00:36:00.011 --> 00:36:07.333]  Only for listeners of this show today, and throughout the rest of the week, it is 149.
[00:36:07.373 --> 00:36:09.254]  Now, I'll tell you why.
[00:36:14.031 --> 00:36:16.533]  They had a large pallet in their warehouse.
[00:36:16.553 --> 00:36:17.454]  It was a big outfit.
[00:36:17.914 --> 00:36:18.595]  Fall over.
[00:36:20.056 --> 00:36:21.558]  A few of the filters got broke.
[00:36:21.658 --> 00:36:23.820]  Most of them don't even have scratches on them.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.201]  They look it over.
[00:36:25.301 --> 00:36:27.783]  If there's more than a scratch on it, they don't sell it.
[00:36:28.964 --> 00:36:33.448]  If they fell over, we've done this once before with some of the big crown stainless steel Berkeys.
[00:36:34.149 --> 00:36:36.851]  And by the way, one of my friends got one that doesn't even have a scratch on it.
[00:36:39.262 --> 00:36:45.003]  $50 off for the scratch and dent sale and they've only got 71 of these.
[00:36:45.203 --> 00:36:46.644]  Only 71 of these.
[00:36:48.004 --> 00:36:50.305]  $50 off if you want one that doesn't have a scratch on it.
[00:36:50.725 --> 00:36:52.505]  And they just said the whole stack has scratches.
[00:36:52.565 --> 00:36:53.205]  Most of them don't.
[00:36:54.766 --> 00:36:57.406]  It is only $149 folks.
[00:36:57.626 --> 00:37:00.847]  You're not going to find a better filter at a price anywhere near that
[00:37:01.764 --> 00:37:02.644]  I don't think so.
[00:37:15.624 --> 00:37:17.446]  Uh, does, uh, dozens of gallons.
[00:37:17.466 --> 00:37:17.746]  What is it?
[00:37:18.006 --> 00:37:19.107]  20 gallons a day.
[00:37:19.548 --> 00:37:21.510]  Thousands and thousands of gallons in its life.
[00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:25.934]  You can get all the details by calling New Millennium Concepts at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:37:25.974 --> 00:37:26.294]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[00:37:26.314 --> 00:37:28.056]  The Berkey Light for $149.
[00:37:28.216 --> 00:37:29.237]  There's only 71 of them.
[00:37:41.377 --> 00:37:46.800]  Or pay 50 bucks more and just get one that's guaranteed to not have a scratch on it.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:53.343]  But personally, if I didn't already have three of these, now four of these, I've got one of the Bergie lights now, I would be getting one of these.
[00:37:53.363 --> 00:37:53.424]  1-888-803-4438
[00:37:58.616 --> 00:38:05.980]  Or you can just get a Berkey light with the light system, the LEDs, and four sport bottles or four potassium iodide mix and match.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.243]  You can get two sports filters, two potassium iodide bottles, or whatever you want for $2.99.
[00:38:10.323 --> 00:38:19.689]  You can get the Berkey light without the lights, the nighttime lights, and two sport bottles or potassium iodide mix and match for $2.20.
[00:38:20.729 --> 00:38:22.470]  That's a great deal.
[00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:26.353]  You're getting two sports bottles or two potassium iodide thrown into that for only $20.
[00:38:28.354 --> 00:38:36.562]  Four Berkey black replacement elements and base without lights, $173, and that'll go in any of your Gravity Fed systems.
[00:38:37.823 --> 00:38:41.126]  Base with lights by itself, $64 for your other filters.
[00:38:41.767 --> 00:38:44.830]  Four Berkey black replacement elements alone, $160.
[00:38:45.711 --> 00:38:50.836]  Four Berkey black replacement elements and LED base lights and two sports bottles, $274.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:53.941]  It goes on and on.
[00:38:53.961 --> 00:38:55.422]  They've got a lot of other specials.
[00:38:55.482 --> 00:38:59.025]  Just give them a call at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:59.346 --> 00:39:03.289]  You've got to tell them Alex Jones sent you to get those deals.
[00:39:03.810 --> 00:39:06.152]  You'll hear the ads running, and it's substantially more.
[00:39:06.532 --> 00:39:09.855]  But through these deals, you can get substantial savings.
[00:39:09.916 --> 00:39:12.658]  And it does go to support the broadcast and what we're doing.
[00:39:12.978 --> 00:39:13.859]  And it's a great product.
[00:39:13.959 --> 00:39:17.803]  I bought these products from people that bought from Jim four years ago.
[00:39:17.863 --> 00:39:18.984]  Now, my first big Berkey.
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.821]  And they've made incredible leaps forward now.
[00:39:21.881 --> 00:39:24.463]  I suggest you make this purchase.
[00:39:24.483 --> 00:39:25.003]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:39:28.305 --> 00:39:30.587]  Alright, I want to thank our callers for holding.
[00:39:31.027 --> 00:39:34.349]  John in Canada, you're... John in England, you're up first.
[00:39:35.210 --> 00:39:36.190]  Welcome to the Airwaves.
[00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:36.650]  Go ahead.
[00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:37.891]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:39:37.951 --> 00:39:40.893]  If you'll let me, I've got a few things I want to talk about, but I'll try and keep them brief.
[00:39:41.033 --> 00:39:41.293]  Sure.
[00:39:41.393 --> 00:39:44.595]  Firstly, I want to say thank you for switching me on to the whole 9-11 con.
[00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:47.337]  I've seen stuff on the internet when
[00:39:48.253 --> 00:39:51.695]  Several months after it happened, I was very curious about just what happened.
[00:39:51.815 --> 00:39:57.559]  Morbid curiosity, I would say, because it was the worst terrorist incident ever in the history of the planet that I'm aware of.
[00:39:58.139 --> 00:40:04.543]  And I just, out of curiosity, went onto Google 9-11 and I started finding all these things about how it was just a complete hoax.
[00:40:05.383 --> 00:40:09.265]  And I downloaded your video and, you know, I was just stunned.
[00:40:09.686 --> 00:40:12.507]  I saw the evidence for Oklahoma and I was stunned.
[00:40:13.048 --> 00:40:17.110]  And I heard about the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and I couldn't believe it.
[00:40:17.495 --> 00:40:29.803]  And ever since then I've been trying to distribute copies of your videos to friends and to switch them on and to spread the word because over here in England, yeah we have perhaps slightly better press coverage about what goes on but we still lie to.
[00:40:30.564 --> 00:40:32.405]  We still heavily lie to and a lot of people
[00:40:33.150 --> 00:40:35.613]  On the face of it, still believe the official story.
[00:40:35.753 --> 00:40:36.834]  Well, I'll tell you the difference.
[00:40:36.934 --> 00:40:39.336]  I'll tell you why England's different, and then I'll let you go on.
[00:40:39.977 --> 00:40:44.941]  Britain was the center of the world empire, as you know well, still is financially controlling the world.
[00:40:45.222 --> 00:40:50.647]  That is not the people of England, but the globalists that live there in the city of London, within London, that private city.
[00:40:51.267 --> 00:40:58.014]  But the reason you have so many more newspapers and so many different angles is because you were a global empire.
[00:40:58.835 --> 00:41:05.241]  You have these big press infrastructures built up, like Reuters, and so there's more of a global coverage.
[00:41:05.301 --> 00:41:08.444]  It's harder for the gatekeepers to shut out a lot of your news.
[00:41:08.624 --> 00:41:15.450]  Yes, you're lied to about what's happening domestically, but internationally you get a lot better news from British newspapers.
[00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:19.474]  That's why we cover a lot of the news out of the United Kingdom.
[00:41:19.494 --> 00:41:20.375]  Now, continuing
[00:41:21.241 --> 00:41:29.854]  With, uh, the points you were raising, what percentage of people that you show wrote a tyranny that you've made copies of and given to them, what percentage are waking up when they see it?
[00:41:30.395 --> 00:41:34.121]  Well, anyone who'll take the CD, I'll say it's 100% of people who take the disc off me.
[00:41:35.051 --> 00:41:37.713]  But they have to be willing to want to take the disc in the first place.
[00:41:37.753 --> 00:41:42.618]  If I say to them, listen, do you want to see some evidence that it's not as simple as the story that you've been told?
[00:41:42.818 --> 00:41:45.100]  That the American government allowed it to happen?
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.222]  And if they say, yeah, give me the disc, I'll give it to them.
[00:41:48.262 --> 00:41:50.865]  If they don't want it, then, you know, you can't crack that shell.
[00:41:51.065 --> 00:41:54.128]  But if people are open-minded to the possibilities, well, that's a different story.
[00:41:54.168 --> 00:41:57.791]  So they won't take the red pill, you just move on and they stay in the Matrix?
[00:41:58.473 --> 00:42:03.234]  Well, if people are willing to show that they want to know more about what's going on, I say, here, take it.
[00:42:03.254 --> 00:42:06.675]  But if people are saying, no, no, no, I won't believe that, then there's nothing you can do for them.
[00:42:07.555 --> 00:42:11.056]  Except assign confession from GWB or whoever else it may be.
[00:42:11.316 --> 00:42:12.837]  And that's the only thing that will convince them.
[00:42:13.557 --> 00:42:15.117]  Which is ludicrous, frankly.
[00:42:15.157 --> 00:42:15.857]  One more question.
[00:42:16.417 --> 00:42:18.578]  You say 100% that CNN are waking up.
[00:42:19.158 --> 00:42:19.338]  Yeah.
[00:42:19.498 --> 00:42:26.660]  Has it woken people up in England to have your big papers admit that MI5 and MI6 have carried out most of the terror in your country?
[00:42:27.547 --> 00:42:28.748]  They don't tie the two together.
[00:42:29.088 --> 00:42:30.229]  They never tie the two together.
[00:42:30.409 --> 00:42:33.851]  Oh, alright, so just, you know, well, we understand that because that was Northern Ireland.
[00:42:34.932 --> 00:42:36.333]  So, yeah, that's what I've seen in your news.
[00:42:36.373 --> 00:42:42.216]  They just calmly announce, okay, the British government bombed this and killed that person and blamed it on this group.
[00:42:42.236 --> 00:42:45.919]  I mean, how do you read that in probably 50 of your papers?
[00:42:46.439 --> 00:42:51.822]  How do people read that in England and they just calmly announce it once or twice like it's no big deal?
[00:42:52.223 --> 00:42:54.024]  Why isn't that a bigger story in your country?
[00:42:54.504 --> 00:42:56.264]  Well, war is complicated.
[00:42:56.304 --> 00:42:56.985]  That's the answer.
[00:42:57.005 --> 00:43:00.285]  And as soon as I heard the story about Stakenite, I assumed that's what you're talking about.
[00:43:00.625 --> 00:43:02.686]  The Stakenite guy, who's now denying it.
[00:43:02.726 --> 00:43:06.326]  But the first question I said on bulletin boards was, how high up does this go?
[00:43:06.586 --> 00:43:07.726]  What do the politicians know?
[00:43:07.946 --> 00:43:08.727]  And when do they know it?
[00:43:08.747 --> 00:43:09.567]  And who gave the orders?
[00:43:09.607 --> 00:43:15.048]  Well, the London Guardian article and the Sunday Herald and all those guys, they have the names.
[00:43:15.068 --> 00:43:21.549]  They have that other MI6 agent, Army Intelligence people, saying they were ordered to carry out bombings by Margaret Thatcher.
[00:43:22.864 --> 00:43:23.484]  Well, there you go then.
[00:43:23.665 --> 00:43:27.027]  I mean, it's a story that I didn't see, but we had the Stevens Inquiry.
[00:43:27.487 --> 00:43:32.170]  PrisonPlanet.com has a giant MI5, MI6 terror section.
[00:43:32.671 --> 00:43:37.134]  Well, I mean, I wanted to talk to you about us being spied on, because as you know, we're one of the most spied on people in the world.
[00:43:37.474 --> 00:43:39.816]  You've got over 3 million surveillance cameras.
[00:43:40.616 --> 00:43:42.057]  Yeah, they're deceased TV cameras.
[00:43:42.117 --> 00:43:45.139]  I mean, do you know about a comedian here called Mark Thomas?
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:46.500]  Uh, no.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.064]  Mark Thomas is a great guy who just, in a similar vein to yourself or Michael Moore, but I think
[00:43:52.779 --> 00:43:57.021]  You know, perhaps more honest even than Michael Moore, because there's question over Columbine.
[00:43:57.901 --> 00:44:10.568]  But anyway, Mark Thomas, one of the things he did was he took a hot air balloon and a bunch of volunteers and cell phones and flew over Menwith Hill, which is the UK base of Echelon, which is all the golf ball domes.
[00:44:10.948 --> 00:44:17.471]  And he's flying over and they're all on their cell phones and they're saying Saddam Hussein, nuclear weapons, anthrax and they're saying all the key words.
[00:44:17.970 --> 00:44:23.433]  Possible to trigger it off whilst flying through restricted airspace just to really get on the tips of the Ministry of Defence.
[00:44:24.914 --> 00:44:27.696]  And this goes out on Channel 4 and there's millions of people who watch it.
[00:44:28.096 --> 00:44:29.857]  Another time he drove a Challenger tank
[00:44:31.072 --> 00:44:32.213]  We're good to go.
[00:44:52.822 --> 00:45:00.563]  Constant anarchic satire to just completely show how completely bankrupt our government is in terms of any moral basis.
[00:45:01.444 --> 00:45:02.104]  Absolutely.
[00:45:02.784 --> 00:45:04.364]  You know, it's great.
[00:45:04.704 --> 00:45:09.765]  I don't know if it's on the internet, but I can try and get you some copies if you want.
[00:45:09.825 --> 00:45:12.766]  Now, did you hear about the BBC program about staving Private Lynch?
[00:45:13.606 --> 00:45:15.046]  About how it was totally fake?
[00:45:15.066 --> 00:45:15.826]  Yeah, I did.
[00:45:16.366 --> 00:45:16.586]  Yeah.
[00:45:16.646 --> 00:45:20.087]  Well, I've sent a copy of the program to Davon Clyst at the Power Hour.
[00:45:20.646 --> 00:45:22.747]  Because I was a caller on the show last week.
[00:45:23.967 --> 00:45:27.289]  So if you're in contact with Dave, perhaps ask him if he's received the CD.
[00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:31.310]  Has it been intercepted by the glorious Homeland Defense Security Services?
[00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:32.671]  Or has it got through?
[00:45:33.091 --> 00:45:37.212]  And if so, maybe he'll burn you off a copy of that, rather than my sending another one by email.
[00:45:37.252 --> 00:45:49.177]  Well, that'd be fantastic, but I have to tell you, John, that's exciting that 100% of people that take the CD from you, again, burning a computer copy of Road to Tyranny or Waking Up, what do they say after they see the film?
[00:45:50.021 --> 00:45:51.182]  Jesus Christ, basically.
[00:45:52.543 --> 00:46:07.835]  They just, you know, at first it's too hard for them to admit, but when I'm now showing, giving people a copy of Masters of Terror, which I managed to find, and, you know, that is much more about 9-11 with boom, boom, boom, newspaper article after newspaper article, and you just can't argue with it.
[00:46:08.362 --> 00:46:09.302]  You cannot argue with it.
[00:46:09.362 --> 00:46:21.487]  I mean, as well as the fact that you've spoken to Stanley Hilton and you have more details from military officers and people in the airlines and all sorts of things like that, that isn't in the official news report of Stanley Hilton's
[00:46:22.191 --> 00:46:23.011]  Um, lawsuit.
[00:46:23.191 --> 00:46:31.753]  So when all these other details come out and you don't understand exactly what these officers are saying, as you said in, uh, Masters of Terror, you know, it's just too much to argue with.
[00:46:31.813 --> 00:46:37.374]  I mean, even if you look at the stand-down of the Air Force, that alone is good enough to impeach.
[00:46:37.674 --> 00:46:39.255]  There's so many things to impeach.
[00:46:39.515 --> 00:46:41.875]  Or how about Supreme Court, no, uh, end of 2000.
[00:46:42.815 --> 00:46:44.416]  Why didn't Scalia recuse himself?
[00:46:45.316 --> 00:46:46.716]  You know, question after question.
[00:46:47.136 --> 00:46:48.096]  Have you heard about the... Absolutely.
[00:46:48.236 --> 00:46:50.117]  Uh, John, great to hear from you.
[00:46:50.137 --> 00:46:51.137]  I appreciate the call, sir.
[00:46:52.192 --> 00:46:53.573]  Great points from the United Kingdom.
[00:46:53.653 --> 00:46:57.256]  Please, though, I'm a Christian, and we're on many Christian stations.
[00:46:57.736 --> 00:46:59.257]  I know we have a worldly audience.
[00:46:59.357 --> 00:47:06.922]  Be very careful about using the Lord's name in vain, because I don't want repercussions of that, not from stations, but from God.
[00:47:07.022 --> 00:47:09.064]  So I'm not mad at you, John, but be careful about
[00:47:10.622 --> 00:47:13.683]  You know, being like the rest of the world, I'm not trying to chastise you.
[00:47:13.783 --> 00:47:16.845]  I just, please folks, we have a lot of homeschoolers listening as well.
[00:47:16.865 --> 00:47:24.170]  You need to be above, and we'll use the King's English, and not use the Lord's name in vain.
[00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:26.611]  I don't want to divert people off, but that's an important point.
[00:47:27.292 --> 00:47:30.333]  Yes sir, you made a lot of wonderful points, and please call back any time.
[00:47:30.714 --> 00:47:32.735]  And I really want to commend you, John.
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:37.263]  for making copies of the video and for getting it out.
[00:47:37.363 --> 00:47:38.144]  God bless you.
[00:47:38.244 --> 00:47:41.287]  It's people like you that are going to stop the New World Order.
[00:47:41.727 --> 00:47:43.128]  I can only commend you.
[00:47:43.449 --> 00:47:46.171]  Thank you so much for what you've done.
[00:47:46.211 --> 00:47:48.013]  In fact, I never thank the listeners enough.
[00:47:48.473 --> 00:47:59.863]  The people that have gotten my films, the people that have made copies and are still making copies, those that have aired them on local community TV stations, those that have rented out the movie theaters and shown it, those that have
[00:48:01.078 --> 00:48:07.102]  I rented out the local gym or ample theater and shown it on a big screen TV.
[00:48:08.543 --> 00:48:10.084]  I want to commend everybody.
[00:48:10.164 --> 00:48:10.884]  God bless you.
[00:48:10.944 --> 00:48:14.607]  It's really having an effect because we could back the globalists off.
[00:48:15.107 --> 00:48:22.892]  I have no doubt that if we wouldn't have been fighting them on 9-1-1 and exposing their involvement, the globalists would have already carried out more terror.
[00:48:23.912 --> 00:48:28.255]  Alright, Rob, Bob, Clint, and others, your calls are up next and a ton of news.

[00:52:12.151 --> 00:52:12.992]  That's the headline.
[00:52:13.012 --> 00:52:17.234]  This is out of Reuters, out of the Sunday Mail.
[00:52:17.655 --> 00:52:18.555]  It's all right here.
[00:52:18.595 --> 00:52:20.937]  It's coming up in a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:52:21.957 --> 00:52:23.618]  Government-run pedophile rings.
[00:52:23.819 --> 00:52:24.799]  Mainstream news.
[00:52:24.959 --> 00:52:25.280]  Yes.
[00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.661]  Calmly being announced in Europe.
[00:52:27.681 --> 00:52:28.722]  This is who runs things.
[00:52:28.742 --> 00:52:30.223]  This is who wants to control your life.
[00:52:30.303 --> 00:52:31.043]  These are the criminals.
[00:52:31.824 --> 00:52:33.625]  It's all coming up on the show.
[00:52:34.677 --> 00:52:38.621]  Real quick, folks, I have produced Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:52:39.221 --> 00:52:40.342]  It is my ninth film.

[00:52:45.486 --> 00:52:48.229]  We cover dozens of other examples of government-sponsored terror.
[00:52:48.389 --> 00:52:50.651]  I didn't cover a 9-1-1 or Masters of Terror.
[00:52:51.131 --> 00:52:58.898]  We cover Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, Total Information Awareness Network, the government-run white slavery rings, the kidnapping rings,
[00:53:00.374 --> 00:53:02.316]  It goes on and on and on, folks.
[00:53:02.357 --> 00:53:03.558]  It is such a good film.
[00:53:03.598 --> 00:53:04.879]  It's very dynamic.

[00:54:08.613 --> 00:54:14.775]  Hey Alex, hey to that guy in London there, you know the reason, and Godspeed to him by the way, the reason
[00:54:26.641 --> 00:54:38.731]  As you know, many people are still unaware, or they might have had an inkling and then lost it, of 9-11 and everything else, is because of the misapprehension and therefore the complicity of our puppet press.
[00:54:39.692 --> 00:54:45.156]  And with email, see, they want to balk at investigation on the one hand.
[00:54:45.859 --> 00:54:48.261]  And then they want to turn around and claim they never heard of it.
[00:54:48.321 --> 00:54:49.562]  It's just ignorance, you know?
[00:54:49.602 --> 00:54:51.243]  Gosh, I never even knew about this stuff.
[00:54:51.323 --> 00:55:01.492]  Yeah, you can have 85% of Americans believing the government was involved in the Kennedy assassination in a Gallup poll, but the pundits act like anybody that thinks that's crazy.
[00:55:01.692 --> 00:55:11.620]  They keep this illusion going where we all feel like we're alone, and a lot of people bow to peer pressure and say, okay, fine, Lee Harvey did it by himself, the government's good, and hung the moon.
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:12.240]  Right.
[00:55:12.761 --> 00:55:19.106]  But also referring to reporters and editors themselves, when you use email, and they conclude their emails in their columns and so on.
[00:55:20.327 --> 00:55:28.673]  You notice how all of a sudden, John Compulsory Service McCain and these guys are really interested, really concerned about spam now.
[00:55:28.933 --> 00:55:30.294]  Just out of the blue, all of a sudden.
[00:55:30.555 --> 00:55:33.457]  They said they want to stop reporters getting email.
[00:55:33.617 --> 00:55:34.518]  It's wrong!
[00:55:34.698 --> 00:55:41.163]  Well, they do, and to confirm that, on National Pentagon Radio the other day, I was just idly listening to one of their ads,
[00:55:41.673 --> 00:55:44.394]  Where they say, and that's supposed to be for the public.
[00:55:44.434 --> 00:55:48.175]  I mean, they already broadcast by franchise, you know, anyway.
[00:55:48.455 --> 00:55:51.376]  Brought to you by the Rockefeller Brothers and Carnegie Endowment, yeah.
[00:55:51.596 --> 00:56:04.260]  Right, so this ad says, you know, typical Mudbath style NPR delivery says, and thanks to the whatever institute trying to stamp out spam and unwanted communications.
[00:56:04.778 --> 00:56:06.859]  And it went by me at first, and I thought, wait a minute.
[00:56:07.099 --> 00:56:08.780]  And unwanted communications.
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.221]  Sure enough, that's exactly what it's all about.
[00:56:11.261 --> 00:56:13.242]  You get one person to complain, they get you.
[00:56:13.522 --> 00:56:14.823]  Are you done, or do you want to add more?
[00:56:14.943 --> 00:56:16.123]  Oh, that's all I wanted to say.
[00:56:16.363 --> 00:56:16.964]  Thank you, sir.
[00:56:17.304 --> 00:56:19.905]  Second hour, only 70 seconds away.
[00:56:21.666 --> 00:56:24.407]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[00:56:24.647 --> 00:56:30.950]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:32.591]  Would you like to make your asset to make-
[00:56:36.354 --> 00:56:39.599]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.229 --> 00:56:47.930]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.551 --> 00:56:49.652]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.313 --> 00:56:51.475]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.495 --> 00:56:52.877]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.636 --> 00:56:54.517]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.537 --> 00:56:58.819]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.379 --> 00:57:03.502]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:08.545 --> 00:57:09.365]  All right, folks.
[00:57:09.485 --> 00:57:17.169]  It's Tuesday, and boy, is there a lot of vital news and information and your calls on this Tuesday, the 27th of May, 2003 edition.
[00:57:17.189 --> 00:57:18.450]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:57:22.475 --> 00:57:27.077]  And coming up, we're going to talk to Bob and Butch and others that are patiently holding.
[00:57:27.537 --> 00:57:35.059]  The toll-free number to join me on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:57:36.620 --> 00:57:37.980]  Coming up, more on this story.
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.441]  I'd like to hear callers mention it.
[00:57:39.921 --> 00:57:41.722]  It's oninfowars.com.
[00:57:42.302 --> 00:57:42.422]  U.S.
[00:57:42.482 --> 00:57:43.662]  plans death camp.
[00:57:43.822 --> 00:57:44.783]  That's the headline.
[00:57:45.483 --> 00:57:48.184]  And this is from Reuters and the Mail on Sunday.
[00:57:49.099 --> 00:57:49.359]  U.S.
[00:57:49.399 --> 00:57:50.300]  plans death camp.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.362]  Also, Red Cross denied access to POWs.
[00:57:53.382 --> 00:57:55.003]  3,000 of them, many of them children.
[00:57:55.383 --> 00:57:57.804]  Homeland Security buys a Mexico town for training.
[00:57:58.245 --> 00:58:00.126]  Euro hits record high versus the dollar.
[00:58:00.486 --> 00:58:02.567]  Six Americans killed in Iraq in the last two days.
[00:58:02.587 --> 00:58:05.049]  Soldiers may sue over Iraq War Syndrome.
[00:58:05.509 --> 00:58:07.050]  War vaccines poison dust.
[00:58:07.550 --> 00:58:08.411]  Gulf War II.
[00:58:09.071 --> 00:58:09.471]  Illness.
[00:58:09.631 --> 00:58:10.752]  It's all coming up.
[00:58:10.812 --> 00:58:13.354]  Pentagon sets sights on new Tehran regime.
[00:58:13.894 --> 00:58:14.634]  A lot of news.
[00:58:14.674 --> 00:58:16.275]  We will cover in detail in this hour.
[00:58:16.396 --> 00:58:16.856]  I promise.
[00:58:17.516 --> 00:58:18.957]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[00:58:19.078 --> 00:58:20.258]  Bob in New York.
[00:58:20.699 --> 00:58:21.860]  Bob, you're on the air, sir.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:22.340]  Go ahead.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.281]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:58:23.381 --> 00:58:24.041]  Fine, my friend.
[00:58:24.182 --> 00:58:25.202]  You're doing a great job.
[00:58:26.003 --> 00:58:37.112]  I got a six-page letter here, a friend of mine dug out of the Internet, by Congressman Henry A. Waxman, and it was written to the Honorable Donald H. Rumsfeld.
[00:58:37.893 --> 00:58:40.014]  Okay, now this letter is amazing.
[00:58:40.755 --> 00:58:42.036]  It goes into the issue of
[00:58:42.526 --> 00:58:49.423]  Halliburton setting up subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands so that they could continue to do their works with
[00:58:50.296 --> 00:58:54.257]  Countries deemed terrorist states or sponsoring terrorism.
[00:58:54.297 --> 00:58:55.538]  Yeah, right into 2001.
[00:58:55.958 --> 00:58:56.618]  Unbelievable.
[00:58:56.658 --> 00:59:00.879]  Halliburton was still selling systems to Saddam.
[00:59:00.919 --> 00:59:07.141]  In fact, that's why they like the sanctions, because Saddam, they would only allow Saddam to buy it from Dick Cheney.
[00:59:07.381 --> 00:59:08.422]  The Monopoly Agreement.
[00:59:08.842 --> 00:59:09.142]  Yes.
[00:59:09.302 --> 00:59:15.204]  But also they're building giant underground military complexes for Libya.
[00:59:16.385 --> 00:59:17.746]  This is just unbelievable.
[00:59:17.926 --> 00:59:23.810]  I mean, these guys... And they've got the sanctions to where you can only go to Carlisle or Halliburton to get anything.
[00:59:24.090 --> 00:59:25.151]  Oh boy, you know.
[00:59:25.531 --> 00:59:27.993]  And, you know, this letter is dated April 30, 2003.
[00:59:28.073 --> 00:59:29.214]  You know, what's going to come of it?
[00:59:31.693 --> 00:59:33.434]  You know, that's what's weird.
[00:59:34.074 --> 00:59:46.559]  That's the incredible part, Bob, is that they say that we gotta stop anybody with terrorist ties, and then no one has ties to the terrorists like George Bush, Dick Cheney, Rumsfeld, and the rest of them.
[00:59:46.899 --> 00:59:49.760]  Brown Root has an office set up, guess where?
[00:59:50.601 --> 00:59:50.941]  Iran.
[00:59:52.006 --> 00:59:52.426]  Iran.
[00:59:52.707 --> 00:59:53.487]  Yeah, Tehran.
[00:59:53.687 --> 00:59:54.508]  Tehran, yeah.
[00:59:54.888 --> 00:59:56.109]  It's like, it's unbelievable.
[00:59:56.249 --> 00:59:57.991]  Yeah, oh, that's how the sanctions work.
[00:59:58.051 --> 00:59:59.472]  You're only allowed to buy from them.
[01:00:00.052 --> 01:00:01.653]  Now they're harboring Al Qaeda.
[01:00:02.254 --> 01:00:03.014]  Well, they are, sir.
[01:00:03.054 --> 01:00:04.856]  They flew 8,000 of them out to safety.
[01:00:05.416 --> 01:00:09.199]  Fox News, MSNBC, but we're supposed to forget about that.
[01:00:09.559 --> 01:00:14.383]  Why did they load 8,000 Taliban Al Qaeda leaders on C-130s flying to safety?
[01:00:16.164 --> 01:00:16.985]  It's unbelievable.
[01:00:17.685 --> 01:00:19.065]  Yeah, let's answer that question.
[01:00:19.225 --> 01:00:20.026]  That's what I mean, sir.
[01:00:20.166 --> 01:00:21.986]  There's hundreds of smoking guns and red flags.
[01:00:22.146 --> 01:00:27.627]  With one of these pieces of evidence, if we had an honest jury, we could put all these guys behind bars for life.
[01:00:28.248 --> 01:00:28.888]  Absolutely.
[01:00:29.408 --> 01:00:41.091]  Um, the other point I wanted to make up is late the other night I was watching C-SPAN, and I got the whole crew for the 9-11 investigation, and one character seemed to stand out amongst all of them.
[01:00:41.631 --> 01:00:45.492]  I mean, all of them are in the system, but, uh, Richard Ben-Vinci?
[01:00:45.992 --> 01:00:46.732]  Oh, you're loving.
[01:00:47.188 --> 01:00:53.012]  This guy has been clowning around since Watergate.
[01:00:53.112 --> 01:00:53.993]  Irene Contra.
[01:00:54.213 --> 01:00:56.194]  Well, who runs Total Information Awareness?
[01:00:56.454 --> 01:00:58.015]  A five-time convicted felon!
[01:00:59.216 --> 01:01:01.057]  Yeah, Admiral Poindexter, right?
[01:01:01.177 --> 01:01:01.838]  Yes.
[01:01:02.738 --> 01:01:03.179]  It's good.
[01:01:03.199 --> 01:01:04.420]  I'm glad you're out here.
[01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:08.823]  Today I'm going to probably order both 9-11 and the new police state.
[01:01:09.663 --> 01:01:10.784]  You know, it's so hard.
[01:01:11.417 --> 01:01:13.017]  to get across to these people.
[01:01:13.377 --> 01:01:31.282]  The friend that dug this out, this literature said that he didn't really, wasn't quite convinced that the pals in our government are behind 9-11, and finally he came across Mohammed Atta in the Venice Flying Circus video, and now he's convinced.
[01:01:31.702 --> 01:01:33.182]  I mean, what is CDS?
[01:01:34.123 --> 01:01:35.223]  Absolutely.
[01:01:35.283 --> 01:01:36.103]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:37.143 --> 01:01:38.944]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[01:01:39.004 --> 01:01:39.584]  Give us a call.
[01:01:43.391 --> 01:01:46.513]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:01:46.773 --> 01:01:50.235]  The Sanjian 505P shortwave radio is the answer.
[01:01:50.755 --> 01:01:55.298]  Featuring continuous tuning for all shortwave frequencies, utilizing direct keypad tuning.
[01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:59.191]  Better shortwave reception.
[01:01:59.691 --> 01:02:03.274]  Single sideband allows for reception of upper and lower sideband signals.

[01:02:26.213 --> 01:02:26.574]  Call today 877-605-9200.
[01:02:26.594 --> 01:02:26.774]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:02:26.794 --> 01:02:27.115]  Call today.
[01:02:42.774 --> 01:02:50.143]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:50.424 --> 01:02:55.169]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:55.390 --> 01:03:01.037]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:05.801]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:03:06.021 --> 01:03:13.187]  The taxable society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:03:13.207 --> 01:03:13.987]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:03:14.027 --> 01:03:17.750]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:20.412]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:03:20.633 --> 01:03:27.358]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:03:27.578 --> 01:03:35.243]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:03:35.443 --> 01:03:39.366]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:39.826 --> 01:03:42.268]  Are you prepared?
[01:03:42.468 --> 01:03:44.849]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:49.513]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[01:03:49.813 --> 01:03:53.275]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[01:03:53.515 --> 01:03:55.657]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[01:03:56.357 --> 01:04:00.360]  Jerry Deddy from the Ark Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.523]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[01:04:03.643 --> 01:04:10.729]  Call the Ark Institute today at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[01:04:10.929 --> 01:04:16.253]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[01:04:16.513 --> 01:04:21.537]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[01:04:21.758 --> 01:04:22.778]  Jerry can help here too.
[01:04:23.599 --> 01:04:28.262]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[01:04:28.482 --> 01:04:32.404]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[01:04:32.524 --> 01:04:34.465]  Call the Ark Institute today, toll free 1-800-255-1912.
[01:04:34.485 --> 01:04:35.306]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com.
[01:04:35.366 --> 01:04:38.127]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:51.033 --> 01:04:53.514]  More minds are being freed every day.
[01:04:53.634 --> 01:04:57.315]  More people are having the blinders taken off of their eyes.
[01:04:57.335 --> 01:05:07.417]  They're seeing the truth and they're glad they know the truth now because imagine what it's like to be ignorant of the facts and not know why your dollar is being reduced in its value.
[01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:10.058]  Not knowing why your real estate prices are plunging.
[01:05:10.378 --> 01:05:12.378]  Not knowing why your 401ks are down by 80% in many cases.
[01:05:16.093 --> 01:05:16.734]  Not knowing?
[01:05:16.754 --> 01:05:23.740]  Well, the New World Order told us why and how, because they write policy reports for their mid-level enforcers, and we read those policy reports.
[01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:28.604]  That's how we knew that they would set up internal checkpoints under the guise of seatbelt checks.
[01:05:29.044 --> 01:05:32.688]  That's how we knew that Amber Alert was really the EAS-FEMA takeover system.
[01:05:33.188 --> 01:05:35.430]  That's how I put it in films, understood their system.
[01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:39.934]  That's how we told you terror would be their road to tyranny, the way they brought America down.
[01:05:41.115 --> 01:05:42.536]  While leaving the borders wide open.
[01:05:42.957 --> 01:05:44.038]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:05:44.078 --> 01:05:46.700]  Let's talk to Butch in Florida, then Tom in Maryland.
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:47.681]  Butch, you're on the air.
[01:05:47.721 --> 01:05:48.181]  Go ahead.
[01:05:48.942 --> 01:05:49.742]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:05:49.762 --> 01:05:50.403]  How are you doing today?
[01:05:50.523 --> 01:05:51.444]  Fantastic, sir.
[01:05:52.245 --> 01:05:56.668]  I have in my hand a hot little piece of antiquated documentation here.
[01:05:56.688 --> 01:06:01.512]  A lot of people would call it propaganda, even.
[01:06:02.453 --> 01:06:06.677]  It's called the Unanimous Declaration of the 13 United States of America.
[01:06:08.732 --> 01:06:10.713]  Sir, sir, they don't call it propaganda.
[01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:12.693]  They call it a terrorist document.
[01:06:13.033 --> 01:06:14.554]  If you talk about it, you're a terrorist.
[01:06:14.594 --> 01:06:24.956]  We have FBI training manuals, FBI flyers in FEMA on tape in Kansas City before 9-1-1 saying Founding Fathers, uh, Christians are enemies of the government.
[01:06:25.956 --> 01:06:27.877]  Well, then I guess I'm an enemy of the government.
[01:06:28.357 --> 01:06:29.017]  Okay.
[01:06:29.237 --> 01:06:36.979]  Because with this document and three others that I have, this pretty much lays out right before me, I mean, I don't understand every single word
[01:06:37.455 --> 01:06:45.781]  But I do understand enough that this paper here says that I am a free, independent, sovereign person, and I live in a free, independent, sovereign state.
[01:06:45.921 --> 01:06:52.826]  And anyone that tries to subvert and overthrow that is the enemy combatant, is the outside force, is the enemy.
[01:06:53.587 --> 01:06:54.988]  Now it's funny you should bring that up.
[01:06:55.348 --> 01:06:57.410]  Would you let me read one sentence of this?
[01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:57.910]  Sure.
[01:06:59.551 --> 01:07:01.473]  This is the second sentence, and it says,
[01:07:02.011 --> 01:07:17.519]  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men
[01:07:18.345 --> 01:07:21.126]  Deriving their just powers from the consent of
[01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:38.954]  "...as to them shall see most likely to affect their safety and happiness.
[01:07:39.134 --> 01:07:56.002]  Prejudice, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes, and accordingly all experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.
[01:07:56.342 --> 01:08:00.924]  But when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object
[01:08:01.647 --> 01:08:03.970]  Now, can you tell me why the American people ain't doing this right now?
[01:08:18.971 --> 01:08:29.158]  They think government's the boss, government is God, government gives all the orders, government is good, and that we are all slaves because they're taking good care of us, and they've been incrementally trained.
[01:08:29.198 --> 01:08:30.679]  The kids aren't taught the Bill of Rights.
[01:08:31.039 --> 01:08:32.801]  They aren't taught the Declaration of Independence.
[01:08:32.821 --> 01:08:41.346]  When my dad was a child, by the fifth grade, they had to recite the Declaration of Independence, and my dad could do it in his little country school.
[01:08:41.907 --> 01:08:44.729]  Today, a child doesn't even know what the Constitution is.
[01:08:47.213 --> 01:08:55.699]  I'm very, very frustrated, mostly with the American people, because they don't seem to understand they are the ones who are in power.
[01:08:56.079 --> 01:08:58.421]  We just elect representatives, okay?
[01:08:59.222 --> 01:09:04.025]  And, just really quick, I want to read this really short sentence here.
[01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:05.646]  Better do it quick, go ahead.
[01:09:05.847 --> 01:09:08.829]  This is what happens to people who don't wake up, okay?
[01:09:08.849 --> 01:09:12.912]  This is referring to King George, in the same article here.
[01:09:13.272 --> 01:09:16.174]  He has erected a multitude of new offices
[01:09:16.716 --> 01:09:20.301]  And sent hither, I can't figure the first... Swarms?
[01:09:20.581 --> 01:09:24.967]  Swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.
[01:09:25.608 --> 01:09:29.694]  Now, America, when you wake up, do you remember what Nikita Khrushchev said?
[01:09:29.734 --> 01:09:30.615]  You will be slaves.
[01:09:30.775 --> 01:09:31.677]  You will be communists.
[01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:33.379]  You will be socialists.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:36.160]  Let me say something.
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:39.721]  I know they've trained people that communism doesn't exist, ha ha ha.
[01:09:40.181 --> 01:09:41.182]  Read the ten planks.
[01:09:41.382 --> 01:09:42.702]  We didn't write it, the communists did.
[01:09:43.103 --> 01:09:47.584]  Read it and ask yourself, have eight of those not been fully instituted in America?
[01:09:47.925 --> 01:09:49.185]  Then let's get more complex.
[01:09:49.205 --> 01:09:51.866]  They'll say, well Bush and Clinton, they're capitalists.
[01:09:52.646 --> 01:09:53.567]  This isn't communism.
[01:09:55.302 --> 01:09:57.083]  Command and Control is what we're dealing with.
[01:09:57.123 --> 01:10:14.556]  Get past the political labels and understand the big bankers of Wall Street in London wrote the Communist Manifesto, had their agents do it, had Karl Marx put it out publicly, they funded the Communists as a thug group to set up feudalism, neo-feudalism, and they've done it.
[01:10:14.656 --> 01:10:15.036]  Go ahead.
[01:10:17.156 --> 01:10:29.521]  Alex, it doesn't matter if it's George, uh, George Jr., George Sr., Bill, it doesn't matter who it has been ever since they started pushing this, this, this new world order crap, this, this globalism stuff, okay?
[01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:40.725]  I mean, virtually every one of these presidents who has been on this kind of, of, uh, agenda, um, they have, uh, erected a multitude of new offices.
[01:10:40.785 --> 01:10:45.147]  They have sent troops to, or they have sent the, uh, people, cops to the people's houses.
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:51.581]  They have, you know, sent the ATF the... Yeah, if people read the Declaration of Independence, it's a repeat.
[01:10:51.661 --> 01:10:52.281]  Great point.
[01:10:52.321 --> 01:10:53.042]  Thanks for the call.
[01:10:53.682 --> 01:10:55.182]  Really appreciate that call, Bush.
[01:10:55.302 --> 01:10:56.002]  Excellent points.
[01:10:57.423 --> 01:11:00.063]  Why haven't you read the Declaration of Independence?
[01:11:00.723 --> 01:11:03.324]  Why haven't you read the Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[01:11:03.664 --> 01:11:05.124]  Why haven't you done that?
[01:11:06.324 --> 01:11:06.604]  Why?
[01:11:06.684 --> 01:11:07.425]  Why haven't you done it?
[01:11:08.385 --> 01:11:13.426]  My book, 9-1-1 Dissent and Deterrent, the last ten pages, are the Bill of Rights,
[01:11:14.224 --> 01:11:15.585]  And the Declaration of Independence.
[01:11:17.085 --> 01:11:21.588]  And then we have the Communist Manifesto beside that, and we say, compare these, read these.
[01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:26.450]  Will you spend 10-15 minutes reading those final 10 pages of my book?
[01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:28.131]  Will you do that?
[01:11:28.231 --> 01:11:30.012]  Will you go online and type in U.S.
[01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:30.712]  Constitution?
[01:11:31.032 --> 01:11:31.573]  Bill of Rights?
[01:11:31.613 --> 01:11:32.393]  Will you not read it?
[01:11:32.673 --> 01:11:34.654]  Will you not type in the Communist Manifesto?
[01:11:34.894 --> 01:11:37.636]  Will you not look at it and see the difference?
[01:11:39.637 --> 01:11:40.537]  Absolutely.
[01:11:42.393 --> 01:11:43.854]  Let's talk to Tom in Maryland.
[01:11:43.914 --> 01:11:44.754]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:11:44.774 --> 01:11:45.214]  Go ahead.
[01:11:45.994 --> 01:11:46.654]  Hello, Alex.
[01:11:46.954 --> 01:11:47.735]  How you doing, sir?
[01:11:47.995 --> 01:12:04.860]  I'm doing great and I was very surprised over the weekend because it had only been two weeks I got my latest order of a Police State 3 and your other films that I didn't have and I got them in less time than you even say on the air.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:06.060]  I wanted to say
[01:12:06.917 --> 01:12:10.578]  To all members of the audience that don't have them, get them!
[01:12:11.378 --> 01:12:12.819]  They're very important to have.
[01:12:12.979 --> 01:12:29.743]  I've started copying them and giving them to a few people and I think that... Well, sir, let me just stop you and I appreciate the kind comments, but since you mentioned how long it takes to get videos, we say three weeks because we have mailed tapes in Austin and they take two weeks.
[01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:32.851]  And then somebody in New York gets them in three days.
[01:12:33.111 --> 01:12:36.312]  So, there is no rhyme or reason to the post office.
[01:12:36.512 --> 01:12:39.713]  Most people get them in seven days, if it's an internet or phone order.
[01:12:40.193 --> 01:12:46.596]  Obviously, if you mail me a check or money order, or cash, it takes three or four days to get here, sometimes longer.
[01:12:46.616 --> 01:12:48.176]  Then we've got to fill the order, takes a couple days.
[01:12:48.476 --> 01:12:51.257]  Then it's got to be shipped to you, but I'm glad you got them in two weeks.
[01:12:51.597 --> 01:12:55.039]  I would say two weeks is about the average, and I want to thank you for your purchase, but go ahead.
[01:12:55.819 --> 01:12:57.980]  I wanted to point out, I think it was on...
[01:12:59.164 --> 01:13:01.927]  The total enslavement tape.
[01:13:02.949 --> 01:13:10.077]  At one point, maybe an hour, hour and a half into the film, you have on the screen, I guess it's...
[01:13:11.818 --> 01:13:16.919]  Uh, new kind of instruction for FBI and or federal officers.
[01:13:17.479 --> 01:13:25.181]  And it says, uh, it doesn't say some people or it just says extremists have strong convictions.
[01:13:25.261 --> 01:13:28.822]  And then it goes on and it's, you know, Defenders of the U.S.
[01:13:28.882 --> 01:13:29.702]  Constitution.
[01:13:29.922 --> 01:13:30.182]  Yes.
[01:13:30.362 --> 01:13:40.924]  And it, and it, one of the things that I personally that made it so easy for me to relate to was it had a reference in that same paragraph
[01:13:41.747 --> 01:13:43.168]  To the Ouachita Nation.
[01:13:43.208 --> 01:13:50.615]  Now, I'm not a member of that, but I did get some of their literature several years ago, and it just, it brings it home to you.
[01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:51.495]  Do you know what I mean?
[01:13:51.856 --> 01:13:55.999]  It's like, yeah, I could be, I could just as easily be that.
[01:13:56.119 --> 01:14:03.946]  Yeah, they list the most, in their larger documents, the most calm, complacent Native American groups.
[01:14:04.286 --> 01:14:10.011]  Sir, they list, okay, homeschoolers in their Megiddo report.
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.683]  They say those that believe a New World Order exist.
[01:14:14.564 --> 01:14:18.349]  I have the Washington Post saying it's a New World Order today!
[01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:19.350]  Exactly.
[01:14:20.050 --> 01:14:21.132]  I don't disagree.
[01:14:21.272 --> 01:14:29.441]  And one of the folks I made copies for said he's going to try and see to it that it's
[01:14:30.572 --> 01:14:34.775]  Terrorist neighbors, I mean homeschoolers, got copies of them.
[01:14:35.156 --> 01:14:37.378]  Because now they are categorized.
[01:14:37.558 --> 01:14:44.303]  And the point is, quietly behind the scenes, at every major police department, FEMA and the Feds are there teaching this.
[01:14:44.323 --> 01:14:45.224]  We have them on video.
[01:14:45.764 --> 01:14:52.450]  What did you think when you saw that guy say the Founding Fathers are terrorists, Christians are terrorists, enemies of the federal government.
[01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:52.990]  Period.
[01:14:53.050 --> 01:14:53.731]  What did you think of that?
[01:14:55.157 --> 01:15:04.080]  I was not really too terribly surprised, because I've been listening to you for so long now, none of this stuff surprised me.
[01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:14.662]  This morning, about an hour ago, when you were talking about the mass graves, the death camps and so forth, I even had an argument with someone over the weekend.
[01:15:14.702 --> 01:15:19.043]  Not an argument, he was a button pusher, and he was pushing my buttons because he knows I was against the war.
[01:15:21.701 --> 01:15:25.564]  Arguments started to take place several weeks ago when I talked to you.
[01:15:25.624 --> 01:15:27.405]  You talked about people flip-flopping and everything.
[01:15:27.725 --> 01:15:34.870]  Well, he started to push my buttons on him, but when I started to get in his face over it and lay some facts on him, then he didn't care.
[01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:35.610]  And that's the thing.
[01:15:35.710 --> 01:15:36.291]  I don't care.
[01:15:36.391 --> 01:15:36.931]  I don't care.
[01:15:37.291 --> 01:15:38.952]  None of this matters to me.
[01:15:38.992 --> 01:15:41.814]  Well, it mattered enough to you to push my buttons.
[01:15:41.954 --> 01:15:43.976]  And then he also insulted your films.
[01:15:44.416 --> 01:15:48.319]  And I told him, and this guy probably could have kicked my teeth in, I said,
[01:15:49.219 --> 01:15:50.420]  And you've never seen them.
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.961]  His brother offered for him to watch them.
[01:15:53.581 --> 01:15:54.542]  He... No!
[01:15:54.742 --> 01:15:55.022]  No!
[01:15:55.362 --> 01:15:56.263]  He would not do it.
[01:15:56.743 --> 01:16:00.545]  So, then he insults your films in front of me.
[01:16:01.125 --> 01:16:06.507]  And I told him, I said, I'm a musician too, and he knows one of my favorite musicians.
[01:16:06.948 --> 01:16:16.312]  I said, you don't talk bad about John McLaughlin, and you don't dare say anything negative about Alex Jones and the films he makes that you won't even watch.
[01:16:16.692 --> 01:16:17.953]  If you're not gonna watch it,
[01:16:18.513 --> 01:16:19.054]  Shut up!
[01:16:19.534 --> 01:16:20.415]  Absolutely, sir.
[01:16:20.555 --> 01:16:21.336]  I want to commend you.
[01:16:21.376 --> 01:16:23.117]  What you do is you ignore that guy.
[01:16:23.598 --> 01:16:24.198]  Move on.
[01:16:24.259 --> 01:16:25.980]  He's afraid deep down inside.
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:29.684]  So he made a split-second decision to deny what you're saying.
[01:16:30.004 --> 01:16:35.329]  He saw the vehemence, the concern in your eyes, the love that you were trying to invest in him.
[01:16:35.789 --> 01:16:36.470]  Move on.
[01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:38.011]  Move on to those that care.
[01:16:38.051 --> 01:16:38.812]  God bless you, Tom.
[01:16:38.852 --> 01:16:40.093]  More news and calls coming up.
[01:16:40.113 --> 01:16:40.534]  Stay with us.
[01:16:42.933 --> 01:16:47.839]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a roadmap, and how easy it would be to get lost?
[01:16:48.139 --> 01:16:49.501]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[01:16:49.541 --> 01:16:51.864]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[01:16:52.304 --> 01:16:55.148]  Fortunately, there is a roadmap to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[01:16:55.188 --> 01:16:55.568]  coins.
[01:16:55.789 --> 01:16:57.050]  The Red Book Guide to U.S.
[01:16:57.090 --> 01:16:58.592]  Coins and History provides you with the
[01:16:58.592 --> 01:16:58.792]  Thank you.

[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:44.541]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[01:17:44.801 --> 01:17:50.543]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[01:17:50.784 --> 01:17:52.144]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[01:17:52.244 --> 01:17:55.926]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[01:17:56.086 --> 01:18:04.789]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella, the two most important protein superfoods known.
[01:18:05.129 --> 01:18:14.759]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water, normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[01:18:15.059 --> 01:18:19.303]  It's also very hydrating, and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[01:18:19.783 --> 01:18:23.507]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease,
[01:18:23.787 --> 01:18:27.992]  Listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley, Sunday evenings at 6 p.m.

[01:18:46.381 --> 01:18:54.948]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[01:18:55.248 --> 01:18:57.109]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water!
[01:18:57.349 --> 01:18:59.451]  No need for expensive, disposable filters.
[01:18:59.691 --> 01:19:03.932]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[01:19:04.233 --> 01:19:09.934]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.

[01:19:29.803 --> 01:19:30.263]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:19:30.343 --> 01:19:32.385]  Not yet available in California and Iowa.
[01:19:41.281 --> 01:19:42.022]  Are you prepared?
[01:19:42.202 --> 01:19:44.606]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[01:19:44.826 --> 01:19:49.252]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[01:19:49.572 --> 01:19:53.037]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[01:19:53.277 --> 01:19:55.400]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[01:19:56.101 --> 01:20:00.104]  Jerry Detty from the Ark Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[01:20:00.344 --> 01:20:03.287]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[01:20:03.387 --> 01:20:10.473]  Call the Ark Institute today at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[01:20:10.693 --> 01:20:16.017]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[01:20:16.277 --> 01:20:21.281]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[01:20:21.522 --> 01:20:22.542]  Jerry can help here too.
[01:20:23.343 --> 01:20:28.005]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[01:20:28.245 --> 01:20:32.167]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.

[01:20:49.242 --> 01:20:55.447]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest, a gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[01:20:55.847 --> 01:20:57.328]  Alright folks, welcome back.
[01:20:57.348 --> 01:21:01.792]  I'm going to cover some news now, about the next 15 minutes or so into the next segment.
[01:21:02.592 --> 01:21:07.616]  And then we'll open the phones back up on this live Tuesday, the 27th of May, 2003.
[01:21:07.996 --> 01:21:11.319]  Worldwide edition as we defend liberty, resist tyranny 110%.
[01:21:13.487 --> 01:21:16.450]  The toll-free number to join me on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:23.776]  Let me detail a few of the articles already, head on a little more, then I'll get into the stuff I haven't covered yet.
[01:21:25.091 --> 01:21:27.012]  This was in the mail on Sunday.
[01:21:27.032 --> 01:21:28.133]  It was also in Reuters.
[01:21:28.353 --> 01:21:28.614]  U.S.
[01:21:28.694 --> 01:21:30.015]  plans death camp.
[01:21:30.515 --> 01:21:33.277]  It's online right now at Infowars.com.
[01:21:33.697 --> 01:21:34.018]  The U.S.
[01:21:34.058 --> 01:21:39.161]  has floated plans to turn Guantanamo Bay into a death camp with its own death row and execution chamber.
[01:21:39.602 --> 01:21:45.726]  Prisoners would be tried, convicted, and executed without leaving its boundaries, without a jury, and without right of appeal.
[01:21:46.066 --> 01:21:48.128]  The mail on Sunday newspaper reported yesterday.
[01:21:48.809 --> 01:21:58.136]  The plans were revealed by Major General Jeffrey Miller, who is in charge of the 680 suspects from 43 countries, including two Australians.
[01:21:59.562 --> 01:22:07.969]  Let me add the caveat to this that General Rick Buck as the former head last year quit refusing to torture people and that the people there aren't even Taliban or Al-Qaeda.
[01:22:08.249 --> 01:22:11.672]  They're old men, young men, goat herders, shoemakers, cobblers.
[01:22:12.232 --> 01:22:13.453]  They've done nothing wrong.
[01:22:13.713 --> 01:22:18.858]  This has been admitted and they're just holding them, training our troops in torture and deprivation.
[01:22:19.358 --> 01:22:25.363]  This is all a set piece to train us and our government flew out 8,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders out to safety
[01:22:26.258 --> 01:22:28.460]  Right before everything imploded over there.
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:29.421]  This is a fact.
[01:22:39.051 --> 01:22:42.474]  The Mail on Sunday reported the move is seen as logical by U.S.
[01:22:42.494 --> 01:22:51.303]  which has been attacked worldwide for breaching the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War since it established the camp in the naval base to hold alleged terrorists from Afghanistan.
[01:22:51.703 --> 01:22:54.566]  But it has horrified human rights groups and lawyers representing detainees.
[01:22:54.586 --> 01:22:57.829]  They see it as a clear indication America has no intention
[01:22:58.675 --> 01:22:59.696]  And it goes on and on.
[01:23:00.137 --> 01:23:00.557]  The U.S.
[01:23:00.597 --> 01:23:06.122]  has already said detainees would be tried by tribunals without juries or appeals to a higher court.
[01:23:06.142 --> 01:23:07.644]  Detainees would be allowed only U.S.
[01:23:07.704 --> 01:23:09.045]  lawyers appointed by the government.
[01:23:10.026 --> 01:23:15.912]  And it says British activist Stephen Jacoby of Fair Trials Abroad said the U.S.
[01:23:16.012 --> 01:23:21.978]  is kicking and screaming against any pressure to conform to British or any other kind of international justice.
[01:23:22.699 --> 01:23:26.321]  American law professor Jonathan Turley, who has led a U.S.
[01:23:26.361 --> 01:23:37.828]  civil rights group protest against the military tribunal's plan to hear cases at Guantanamo Bay, said it is not surprising that authorities are building a death row because they have said they plan to try capital cases before these tribunals.
[01:23:38.249 --> 01:23:39.890]  The camp was created to execute people.
[01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:43.492]  The administration has no interest in long-term prison sentences for people.
[01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:48.515]  Now, a lot of you say, good, torture them, good, execute them.
[01:23:48.555 --> 01:23:51.777]  Folks, it's anybody who is an alleged terrorist.
[01:23:52.635 --> 01:24:07.998]  And now you saw the California Deputy Attorney General Mike Van Winkle in the Oakland Tribune last week saying that protesting a war can aid terrorists and may be considered terrorism.
[01:24:08.419 --> 01:24:09.319]  That was his response.
[01:24:09.359 --> 01:24:16.240]  He said they're allowed to shoot at peaceful protesters with wooden and rubber bullets because they're aiding terrorists by protesting.
[01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:19.641]  Now, Mike Van Winkle is a liberal!
[01:24:20.521 --> 01:24:23.082]  And you notice, he's in with Bush and he loves it!
[01:24:25.023 --> 01:24:31.526]  The liberals up in Wisconsin arrested a pro-life demonstrator, Steven Magritsch, for suing public officials.
[01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:40.751]  The state prosecutor said in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, this is in Police State 3 Total Enslavement, by the way, all these documents, that you're not allowed to sue public officials in Wisconsin.
[01:24:40.771 --> 01:24:42.191]  It is an act of terrorism.
[01:24:42.652 --> 01:24:45.113]  Listed under their own Patriot Act, they passed!
[01:24:46.058 --> 01:24:59.909]  You got Oregon trying to pass a law under Senator Menace, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, where if one protester blocks traffic, everyone in the protest gets life in prison unless they agree to 25 years in a labor camp.
[01:24:59.969 --> 01:25:02.110]  If they agree, hence it's not a forced labor camp.
[01:25:02.471 --> 01:25:05.133]  It lists Forest Work Camps.
[01:25:06.394 --> 01:25:09.396]  You have entered the Twilight Zone, folks, and it is for real.
[01:25:10.737 --> 01:25:11.998]  Well, then I better shut up!
[01:25:12.078 --> 01:25:14.040]  I better not say anything, they'll get me!
[01:25:16.152 --> 01:25:20.959]  Attitudes like that bring you Soviet Russia, Communist China, Nazi Germany.
[01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:25.667]  Attitudes like that is not what it is to be an American!
[01:25:26.306 --> 01:25:28.046]  And they're not going to get away with it.
[01:25:28.066 --> 01:25:30.907]  Because tens of millions already know who carried out 9-1-1.
[01:25:31.027 --> 01:25:33.788]  And they'll just wake their neighbors up.
[01:25:33.928 --> 01:25:35.208]  It'll be hundreds of millions.
[01:25:35.628 --> 01:25:40.570]  Globally, there are hundreds of mainstream papers saying the Globalists carried 9-1-1 out.
[01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:45.711]  The Chicago Sun-Times just hit them and hit them hard, saying there's a cover-up.
[01:25:46.151 --> 01:25:47.431]  It's all over the place.
[01:25:47.811 --> 01:25:50.352]  They're having to report this because they can't stop us.
[01:25:50.652 --> 01:25:55.515]  There are hundreds of videos, hundreds of books, thousands of websites now telling the truth.
[01:25:55.795 --> 01:26:00.778]  More people are waking up each day and the globalists can pull another terror attack.
[01:26:01.138 --> 01:26:02.298]  It isn't going to help them.
[01:26:03.699 --> 01:26:07.081]  Bottom line, you better become a man out there.
[01:26:07.101 --> 01:26:12.164]  You better become a woman out there and stand for your family and this country or we're cooked!
[01:26:13.424 --> 01:26:16.066]  We're in a death grip battle with the New World Order.
[01:26:16.886 --> 01:26:17.527]  No quarter.
[01:26:18.387 --> 01:26:19.268]  No quarter given.
[01:26:19.428 --> 01:26:19.928]  No quarter.
[01:26:20.876 --> 01:26:22.176]  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:22.216 --> 01:26:24.037]  This is all the way.
[01:26:26.277 --> 01:26:28.637]  110% combat for America.
[01:26:28.697 --> 01:26:29.878]  The final battle.
[01:26:29.918 --> 01:26:30.878]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:33.058 --> 01:26:33.978]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.438 --> 01:26:36.059]  The empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.079 --> 01:26:39.779]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.020]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation.
[01:26:46.260 --> 01:26:48.901]  But during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:53.706]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most action.
[01:26:53.727 --> 01:26:53.747]  803-4438.
[01:26:53.767 --> 01:26:55.149]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:27:09.295 --> 01:27:10.136]  All right, my friends.
[01:27:10.176 --> 01:27:10.316]  Look.
[01:27:10.356 --> 01:27:11.596]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:27:11.676 --> 01:27:12.517]  And reality is scary.
[01:27:12.557 --> 01:27:13.618]  But we're all gonna die.
[01:27:13.658 --> 01:27:17.460]  We're all gonna die of cancer and car wrecks or of heart attacks.
[01:27:33.354 --> 01:27:36.935]  And there is a God, there is a heaven, there is divine intervention.
[01:27:37.455 --> 01:27:39.236]  America does have a future.
[01:27:40.416 --> 01:27:41.277]  Look at our past.
[01:27:41.317 --> 01:27:42.537]  Look at everything we've been through.
[01:27:42.577 --> 01:27:43.877]  The great evils we've righted.
[01:27:44.338 --> 01:27:45.818]  Only to be confronted by new evils.
[01:27:46.058 --> 01:27:47.999]  Every generation has an evil it must face.
[01:27:48.459 --> 01:27:54.681]  And if it doesn't face that evil, the degradation, the control only gets worse and it makes the job harder for the next generation.
[01:27:55.549 --> 01:28:01.194]  And a lot of you don't see yourselves as leaders, you don't see yourselves as activists, you don't see yourselves as being involved.
[01:28:01.234 --> 01:28:09.341]  But you understand the fake left-right paradigm, you know what the New World Order is, and it's your job to get involved and say no to this!
[01:28:10.041 --> 01:28:13.604]  I mean, folks, it's not just that the New World Order is a bunch of corrupt good ol' boys.
[01:28:14.585 --> 01:28:16.447]  It's light years past that.
[01:28:17.788 --> 01:28:21.850]  Why do you think they've allowed a trillion dollars to be stolen from the Pentagon in the last decade?
[01:28:22.190 --> 01:28:24.291]  Because it corrupts the officers.
[01:28:24.771 --> 01:28:29.694]  Why do they let the officers have these credit cards and buy a hundred stereos and sell them out of the back of a truck?
[01:28:30.174 --> 01:28:31.355]  To get dirt on them.
[01:28:31.835 --> 01:28:35.657]  Why do they allow local police to deal drugs and run corrupt operations?
[01:28:36.037 --> 01:28:37.218]  To get control of them.
[01:28:37.818 --> 01:28:40.559]  It's a corrupting influence, a corrupting system.
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:42.640]  We've got to stand up.
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:43.701]  We've got to say no.
[01:28:44.221 --> 01:28:46.302]  It is the nature of corruption that it grows.
[01:28:47.355 --> 01:28:59.881]  I mean, every time I open the paper up, look around the world and see what's happening, world leaders in Norway and in Portugal and in England are being caught involved in pedophile rings.
[01:29:00.382 --> 01:29:04.544]  DynCorp's caught kidnapping hundreds of thousands of women and children in 2000.
[01:29:05.684 --> 01:29:16.370]  I mean, the stuff these people do is so unbelievably off the Richter scale, how, if you know about it, can you not expose them?
[01:29:17.043 --> 01:29:26.227]  I mean, when they've been caught spraying biologicals on hundreds of cities, and they've been caught putting trash in the vaccines for the civilians and the military, how can you trust them?
[01:29:26.548 --> 01:29:32.110]  When you know the things they've done, when you know the crimes they've committed, how are you going along with them?
[01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:35.052]  Alright, I've got a bunch of other news we haven't gotten to yet.
[01:29:36.252 --> 01:29:37.613]  It's just, it's all out of control.
[01:29:37.713 --> 01:29:43.856]  It's coming up here momentarily, then we'll go to Jan in Florida, and others that are patiently holding.
[01:29:45.549 --> 01:29:49.653]  Before I go any further though, let me just plug a couple things here real quick.
[01:29:53.196 --> 01:30:06.449]  Number one, one of the issues that needs to be covered is the fact that there's a whole line of British Berkey, British Berkfield products at New Millennium Concepts carries
[01:30:07.716 --> 01:30:12.598]  They have filters that will do a whole neighborhood, you know, sit in the corner of a room.
[01:30:12.638 --> 01:30:17.520]  They have smaller units that do 20 gallons a day, 30,000 gallons in their lifetime.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:21.702]  They've come out with new super black Berkey filters that clean everything out.
[01:30:21.742 --> 01:30:22.562]  It's just incredible.
[01:30:23.703 --> 01:30:28.165]  They have a new type that's made out of the bulletproof type plastic Lexan.
[01:30:28.205 --> 01:30:29.125]  It's see-through.
[01:30:30.086 --> 01:30:32.687]  It is just an amazing system.
[01:30:32.727 --> 01:30:35.528]  It has a base with lights in it.
[01:30:36.098 --> 01:30:36.458]  We're good to go.
[01:31:01.119 --> 01:31:04.222]  And you get two sports bottles of potassium iodate mix and match for $2.20.
[01:31:04.482 --> 01:31:12.287]  They have four Berkey black replacement elements that go into many of the gravity-filled type filters that are out there.
[01:31:12.327 --> 01:31:14.409]  Just ask them when you call about the model you already have.
[01:31:14.469 --> 01:31:15.530]  Great replacement filters.
[01:31:16.230 --> 01:31:19.593]  They have the base with the lights for your existing Berkey for $64.
[01:31:19.993 --> 01:31:21.954]  Four Berkey black replacement elements is only $160.
[01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:28.315]  But folks, they have a special today, and there's not going to be many of these left.
[01:31:28.335 --> 01:31:29.076]  You need to call.
[01:31:29.116 --> 01:31:30.317]  If it's busy, leave your name and number.
[01:31:30.337 --> 01:31:32.218]  They'll call you right back, or call back yourself.
[01:31:32.298 --> 01:31:33.359]  And we have a few operators.
[01:31:33.839 --> 01:31:34.800]  Keep costs down.
[01:31:36.252 --> 01:31:40.133]  And the new Berkey Light is made right here in America, folks, employing Americans.
[01:31:40.793 --> 01:31:41.894]  This is the big distributor.
[01:31:41.934 --> 01:31:43.174]  This is the manufacturer.
[01:31:43.634 --> 01:31:44.815]  You need to give them a call.
[01:31:45.135 --> 01:31:47.476]  They had a big pallet of them fall over.
[01:31:47.616 --> 01:31:48.516]  A few were crushed.
[01:31:48.956 --> 01:31:50.517]  Most of them weren't even damaged.
[01:31:51.377 --> 01:31:56.479]  Some of them have scratches, but they're saying the whole pallet... You know, they're throwing out the few that are bad.
[01:31:56.519 --> 01:31:57.759]  I talked to the folks in the warehouse.
[01:31:59.620 --> 01:32:02.941]  The whole pallet is being considered damaged, though they're not.
[01:32:02.981 --> 01:32:03.981]  They look at them carefully.
[01:32:05.845 --> 01:32:15.712]  $149.
[01:32:06.566 --> 01:32:15.712]  Now you can get the big Berkey light by itself, without the lights, with the two filters, excellent value for $199.
[01:32:17.453 --> 01:32:25.879]  But if you call and say you want one of the dented or scratched or, you know, whatever units, and I was told most of them don't even have a scratch.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.941]  So it's kind of luck of the draw what you're going to get.
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:33.221]  It's only $149, a $50 savings.
[01:32:33.321 --> 01:32:37.563]  Folks, take advantage of this, or if you want one that isn't scratched, $199.
[01:32:38.663 --> 01:32:50.127]  Or if you want one of the units with the lights and all the other stuff on it, or the four filters, then it's $299 with four sports bottles or potassium iodate to protect you during nuclear attack.
[01:32:51.407 --> 01:32:52.467]  Give them a call, folks.
[01:32:52.607 --> 01:32:53.548]  Don't wait on this.
[01:32:54.208 --> 01:32:54.408]  Look,
[01:32:55.965 --> 01:32:59.511]  Once you've been drinking filtered water for a month, try to drink tap water.
[01:32:59.612 --> 01:33:03.418]  It stinks, it tastes horrible, and we supposedly got good water here in Austin.
[01:33:03.739 --> 01:33:06.383]  If I drink a big glass of it in the morning, it makes me feel nauseous.
[01:33:07.104 --> 01:33:07.405]  Okay?
[01:33:08.815 --> 01:33:10.897]  And the sports bottles are so you can take them to work.
[01:33:11.017 --> 01:33:11.857]  Give them to your kids.
[01:33:11.977 --> 01:33:13.919]  Get off the poison water, folks.
[01:33:14.119 --> 01:33:17.361]  The dead bacteria, the chlorine, the fluoride, all the trash.
[01:33:17.942 --> 01:33:18.702]  Give them a call.
[01:33:18.722 --> 01:33:19.583]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:33:19.603 --> 01:33:20.124]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[01:33:30.683 --> 01:33:32.264]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:33:32.284 --> 01:33:34.366]  These discounts are only for Alex Jones listeners.
[01:33:34.386 --> 01:33:35.286]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:43.252]  I would take advantage of the scratch your dent sale and get one for $149.
[01:33:43.472 --> 01:33:44.393]  You're not going to beat that.
[01:33:44.413 --> 01:33:44.473]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:33:48.502 --> 01:33:49.262]  And I haven't checked.
[01:33:49.282 --> 01:33:50.843]  There were 71 of these this morning.
[01:33:50.863 --> 01:33:52.383]  She just sold one when I talked to her.
[01:33:53.003 --> 01:33:53.863]  So there were 70.
[01:33:53.984 --> 01:33:55.264]  Now there's probably 40 left.
[01:33:55.404 --> 01:33:55.744]  I don't know.
[01:33:55.804 --> 01:33:56.384]  I haven't checked.
[01:33:56.644 --> 01:33:57.464]  Need to give them a call.
[01:33:57.484 --> 01:33:58.005]  888-803-4438.
[01:33:58.665 --> 01:34:01.706]  Alright, let me get back into the news.
[01:34:03.046 --> 01:34:04.186]  There is so much of it.
[01:34:04.846 --> 01:34:06.967]  Six Americans killed in Iraq in two days.
[01:34:06.987 --> 01:34:10.488]  We're very sad for those that died over Memorial Day.
[01:34:11.662 --> 01:34:16.386]  We support the troops when they were nerve gas in the first Gulf War and weren't given treatment.
[01:34:16.466 --> 01:34:20.210]  We have the scientists and doctors on and the proof until they had to admit it.
[01:34:20.590 --> 01:34:21.971]  They're still not giving them treatment.
[01:34:22.351 --> 01:34:22.932]  Two U.S.
[01:34:22.952 --> 01:34:31.980]  soldiers and two unidentified attacks were killed and nine other American troops were wounded in a firefight Tuesday in the troubled town of Baljela.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:37.284]  The two other Americans died in accidents Tuesday and another two Americans were killed Monday, the U.S.
[01:34:37.324 --> 01:34:38.125]  military said.
[01:34:39.998 --> 01:34:49.161]  Six Iraqis were captured after the attack and were being interrogated Tuesday afternoon, said Major Randy Martin, a spokesman for the Army's V Corps.
[01:34:49.781 --> 01:34:52.882]  The attackers used rocket-propelled grenades and small arms, U.S.
[01:34:52.902 --> 01:34:56.404]  Central Command said, but Martin said the grenade was thrown by hand.
[01:34:58.704 --> 01:35:02.025]  And folks, the place is battling cholera spreading everywhere.
[01:35:02.045 --> 01:35:06.307]  10,000 Iraqis have died conservatively since the end of the war.
[01:35:07.390 --> 01:35:10.391]  It is horrible, and the real toll is about to come home.
[01:35:10.451 --> 01:35:15.912]  We know the government is sterilizing and doing other things to troops with these vaccines.
[01:35:16.292 --> 01:35:30.654]  We know the last anthrax shot was proven to be deadly dangerous, filled with bizarre microplasms, filled with DNA fragments, filled with poisons, filled with chemicals, filled with bizarre genetically engineered fungus.
[01:35:31.155 --> 01:35:33.355]  This is mainstream news.
[01:35:35.032 --> 01:35:37.774]  Soldiers may sue over Iraq War Syndrome.
[01:35:37.794 --> 01:35:39.115]  They're doing it again.
[01:35:40.036 --> 01:35:42.257]  And you've heard the callers, you've read the news articles.
[01:35:43.558 --> 01:35:55.687]  Or some Marine Corps captain's 30 years old and great health can run marathons, takes the shots, gets muscular dystrophy, gets Hutchings, gets all these different diseases.
[01:35:55.727 --> 01:35:58.969]  They just misdiagnosed him days after getting the shots.
[01:35:59.449 --> 01:36:03.790]  They're making women in the military who are breastfeeding take the smallpox shot.
[01:36:04.330 --> 01:36:05.510]  It is insane!
[01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:10.311]  Now they say on MSNBC that David Bloom may have died from the shots the evidence showed.
[01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:13.432]  Because people, one out of about 500 are having a heart attack.
[01:36:13.732 --> 01:36:15.852]  One out of a thousand are dying that take the shots.
[01:36:15.872 --> 01:36:17.232]  That's mainstream news numbers.
[01:36:18.413 --> 01:36:25.534]  The soldiers are blaming their ailments including depression, eczema, and breathing problems on vaccinations they had before the war.
[01:36:27.106 --> 01:36:33.372]  They say the vaccinations designed to protect them against chemical weapons made them feel so ill they could not actually take part in the campaign.
[01:36:34.673 --> 01:36:43.862]  Hundreds of thousands of troops in the last five years have gone and had their sperms saved before vaccinations because a large percentage are becoming sterile after.
[01:36:44.523 --> 01:36:46.865]  Again, part of this sterilization program.
[01:36:48.563 --> 01:36:56.468]  Solicitor Mark McGee, who is representing the Unidentified Force, said, I personally have dealt with well in excess of 400 Gulf War I veterans.
[01:36:56.828 --> 01:37:02.952]  The symptoms which these individuals are experiencing are identical to those of the individuals I represent in relation to the first Gulf War conflict.
[01:37:03.432 --> 01:37:04.953]  The brain scan!
[01:37:05.965 --> 01:37:11.550]  Have found that at least 200,000 troops were hit by low levels of nerve gas.
[01:37:12.070 --> 01:37:14.972]  They did autopsies and biopsies of living people.
[01:37:15.152 --> 01:37:16.894]  Autopsies of dead, biopsies of living.
[01:37:17.274 --> 01:37:23.039]  And found massive sarin VX deposits in the cerebral cortex and in the brain stem.
[01:37:23.179 --> 01:37:24.840]  Frontal and lower parts of the brain.
[01:37:26.562 --> 01:37:29.784]  And many of the troops have these bizarre microplasms in their blood.
[01:37:31.686 --> 01:37:32.526]  It's incredible.
[01:37:32.666 --> 01:37:34.268]  It's absolutely incredible.
[01:37:35.274 --> 01:37:37.895]  So we'll be discussing that.
[01:37:38.195 --> 01:37:41.417]  And by the way, a lot of these guys are dying from this.
[01:38:00.991 --> 01:38:06.215]  Continuing, fears of Gulf War II syndrome after British soldiers given multiple vaccines fall ill.
[01:38:06.956 --> 01:38:09.238]  Four soldiers vaccinated again before the Iraq War.
[01:38:09.478 --> 01:38:24.931]  The veterans organizations are demanding that he offer whom the defense secretary explain why he told the commons in January the soldiers would not be given multiple vaccinations over a short time frame because of the lessons learned in his own report from the previous Gulf conflict.
[01:38:24.951 --> 01:38:25.991]  They now admit it's real.
[01:38:26.031 --> 01:38:30.155]  They claim he then allowed the armed forces to allow 91 procedures for vaccinations.
[01:38:31.301 --> 01:38:35.584]  Anthrax, smallpox, and other injections and other unnamed vaccinations.
[01:38:35.644 --> 01:38:37.026]  Some drop dead on sight.
[01:38:39.067 --> 01:38:39.828]  Incredible.
[01:38:40.949 --> 01:38:42.590]  This is the Toronto Star.
[01:38:42.670 --> 01:38:44.311]  Thousands caught in crackdown.
[01:38:44.711 --> 01:38:46.153]  Crisis effectively closes.
[01:38:46.413 --> 01:38:47.714]  North York General.
[01:38:48.114 --> 01:39:00.664]  The quarantine, netcast, and SARS widened yesterday and caught up thousands of healthcare workers, patients, and visitors to four Toronto hospitals as public health officials scrambled to limit any further possible spread of the mystery virus.
[01:39:01.264 --> 01:39:12.111]  North York General Hospital, the center of the latest outbreak, is now effectively closed after suspending all services and three of its sites, the Branson said, LaCie Street sites, and the Seniors Health Center.
[01:39:14.272 --> 01:39:15.513]  Thousands quarantined.
[01:39:16.134 --> 01:39:19.195]  Pentagon set sites on new Tehran regime.
[01:39:19.256 --> 01:39:22.337]  Tehran, the capital of Iran.
[01:39:22.357 --> 01:39:29.362]  They also have the launch dates, I'm told, by military sources for the invasion of Syria.
[01:39:31.491 --> 01:39:32.252]  And Damascus.
[01:39:32.412 --> 01:39:39.596]  The Pentagon has proposed a policy of regime change in Iran after reports of Al-Qaeda leaders are coordinating terrorist attacks from Iran.
[01:39:39.716 --> 01:39:41.618]  Sure, and the Easter Bunny's gonna bite ya.
[01:39:42.258 --> 01:39:44.420]  But the plan is opposed by U.S.
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:45.080]  State Department.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:59.990]  The British government officials in Washington said yesterday the Pentagon plan would involve overt means, such as anti-government broadcast transmitted to Iran, and covert means possibly including support for Iraq-based armed oppression opposition movement, Mujahideen Qalad.
[01:40:00.730 --> 01:40:05.634]  Our MEUK, even though it is designed and designated as a terrorist group by the State Department.
[01:40:06.014 --> 01:40:09.336]  So again, they use Al-Qaeda to attack the Serbs, to get them to fight back.
[01:40:09.657 --> 01:40:15.141]  They're now going to use large paramilitary forces, commanded by Ba'ath terrorists, to invade.
[01:40:15.921 --> 01:40:22.906]  The State Department and Britain have objected to the plan, saying that it would backfire, undermining the moderates around President Mohammed Khamenei.
[01:40:24.407 --> 01:40:26.549]  Well, see, the State Department always plays the part of the good cop.
[01:40:27.199 --> 01:40:32.320]  A lot is going on both sides of the Atlantic to take another look at the Iran policy, officials said.
[01:40:34.041 --> 01:40:35.441]  So that's the situation there.
[01:40:35.641 --> 01:40:35.921]  U.S.
[01:40:35.961 --> 01:40:38.322]  cuts contact with Iran.
[01:40:38.982 --> 01:40:47.584]  Financial Times, the Bush administration has cut off contact with Iran, said Pentagon officials, and are pushing for action they believe could destabilize the government.
[01:40:47.604 --> 01:40:53.466]  The Washington Post reports, including, again, taking over the radio and TV stations with C-130 broadcast systems and
[01:40:54.517 --> 01:40:55.477]  I'll arrest the garbage.
[01:40:56.038 --> 01:40:58.218]  So, escalating the crisis there.
[01:40:59.579 --> 01:41:01.200]  Now here's where it really gets serious.
[01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:03.701]  This is MSNBC.
[01:41:04.981 --> 01:41:05.881]  Classified.
[01:41:06.022 --> 01:41:08.202]  Censoring the report about 9-1-1.
[01:41:08.262 --> 01:41:17.126]  Bush officials are refusing to permit the release of matters already in the public domain, including in the existence of the intelligence documents referred to on the CIA website.
[01:41:17.486 --> 01:41:19.387]  They want to make public hearing secret.
[01:41:20.307 --> 01:41:22.428]  The report's C-SPAN broadcast secret.
[01:41:23.275 --> 01:41:30.338]  If they do this, the White House has already said they have, so it's all just up to what Caesar says now.
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:35.121]  Public stuff can be considered a terrorist action.
[01:41:35.421 --> 01:41:37.041]  Just having public broadcasts.
[01:41:37.062 --> 01:41:38.402]  You see where this is going, folks?
[01:41:38.642 --> 01:41:39.202]  They're desperate.
[01:41:40.563 --> 01:41:44.465]  Why is the Bush administration blocking the release of an 800-page congressional report about 9-1-1?
[01:41:44.905 --> 01:41:45.685]  Bipartisan report.
[01:41:45.706 --> 01:41:46.666]  Deals with law enforcement.
[01:41:47.398 --> 01:41:49.339]  And intelligence failures have preceded the attacks.
[01:41:49.479 --> 01:41:56.383]  For months, congressional leaders and admission administration officials have battled over declassifying the document, preventing a public release.
[01:41:57.324 --> 01:41:59.845]  Once slated for this week, Newsweek has learned.
[01:41:59.885 --> 01:42:00.105]  Yeah.
[01:42:00.445 --> 01:42:01.966]  And they'll probably release parts of it.
[01:42:02.006 --> 01:42:07.029]  It'll say the government didn't do anything wrong, and they'll... See, they'll act like something's really bad and release it.
[01:42:08.230 --> 01:42:15.534]  Many of those involved in the committees, by the way, were involved in a meeting with the head of Pakistani intelligence who wired the money to Mohammed Adda and involved in the cover-up.
[01:42:16.892 --> 01:42:22.160]  Among the portions of the report the administration refuses to declassify, sources say, are chapters dealing with two...
[01:42:23.317 --> 01:42:32.459]  Politically and diplomatically sensitive issues, the details of daily intelligence briefings given to Bush in the summer 2001, and evidence pointing to Saudi government ties to Al-Qaeda.
[01:42:32.839 --> 01:42:43.741]  Bush officials have taken such a hard line, sources say, that they are refusing to permit the release of matters already in public domain, including the existence of an intelligence documents referred to on the CIA website.
[01:42:44.141 --> 01:42:45.762]  One document is called PDP,
[01:42:47.302 --> 01:42:50.064]  Well, folks, we already have the aftermath of PDB.
[01:42:50.104 --> 01:42:50.664]  It's called W199I.
[01:42:51.124 --> 01:42:51.524]  And that was the
[01:43:09.995 --> 01:43:15.659]  Justice Department order out of the President's desk, ordering FBI agents not to stop Al Qaeda.
[01:43:16.339 --> 01:43:29.128]  As FBI agents lived in the homes of many of the hijackers, paid for their credit cards, issued by the FBI, CIA, and Mossad, paid for their homes, paid for their cars, paid for everything!
[01:43:30.429 --> 01:43:34.252]  This is an admitted mainstream fact!
[01:43:36.553 --> 01:43:37.214]  Admitted!
[01:43:37.814 --> 01:43:39.055]  Now, if I
[01:43:39.815 --> 01:43:42.997]  ...was paying for the hijackers' cars and homes, I should be arrested.
[01:43:43.017 --> 01:43:43.657]  But you know what?
[01:43:43.977 --> 01:43:44.537]  I haven't!
[01:43:44.958 --> 01:43:46.218]  I'm against these terrorists!
[01:43:46.518 --> 01:43:48.619]  And I'm against the CIA, I mean Al-Qaeda!
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:52.001]  And I stand with America and the Bill of Rights!
[01:43:52.041 --> 01:43:53.822]  They're using us to destroy this country!
[01:43:54.935 --> 01:44:13.768]  The article goes on and on that Bush got all these briefings August 6 and dealt with the possibility that Al Qaeda might hijack planes, but an administration review committee overseen by CIA Director Mafia Boss George Kennett has refused to declassify anything that even refers to the existence of PDBs, though they are described on the CIA's own website.
[01:44:13.808 --> 01:44:19.031]  So, W199I is a PDB.
[01:44:19.071 --> 01:44:20.312]  I can't say that right for some reason.
[01:44:21.653 --> 01:44:23.834]  And what is W199I?
[01:44:23.874 --> 01:44:32.297]  Let me turn to my book, Descent into Tyranny, which is nothing more than the areas and screenshots of the mainstream news articles.
[01:44:32.317 --> 01:44:41.360]  Let me turn to that BBC news article and I'll read what W199I is for those that forgot about it when we get back.
[01:44:43.101 --> 01:44:44.541]  I'll stop trying to go so fast.
[01:44:44.561 --> 01:44:48.423]  I know we've got collars holding and I really turn into a bumbling idiot when I talk too fast.
[01:44:49.483 --> 01:44:50.003]  I got this.
[01:44:50.043 --> 01:44:51.244]  Here's Chicago Sun-Times.
[01:44:51.324 --> 01:44:53.164]  Bush answers on 9-1-1 overdue.
[01:44:53.705 --> 01:44:54.865]  That's coming up as well.

[01:45:04.809 --> 01:45:06.469]  What really happened September 11th?
[01:45:06.610 --> 01:45:07.710]  And who stands to gain?
[01:45:08.414 --> 01:45:09.695]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:45:25.802 --> 01:45:29.586]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[01:45:29.826 --> 01:45:34.470]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:45:34.570 --> 01:45:40.816]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:45:40.876 --> 01:45:42.698]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:46:14.289 --> 01:46:14.830]  We listened.
[01:46:15.150 --> 01:46:20.135]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:46:20.415 --> 01:46:20.895]  We listened.
[01:46:21.276 --> 01:46:24.319]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:46:24.739 --> 01:46:25.280]  We listened.
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:28.763]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during

[01:48:14.405 --> 01:48:16.706]  Howard, your calls are coming up here in a second.
[01:48:16.746 --> 01:48:18.326]  Well, I want to be fair to you.
[01:48:18.406 --> 01:48:24.187]  If you just hold another five minutes, we'll start in the next hour with your calls.
[01:48:44.935 --> 01:48:56.361]  W1999, Greg Powell sent a copy of it, right after 9-1-1, and we believe that former deputy head of the FBI was the guy that it was leaked to, John O'Neill, but he's dead.
[01:48:58.442 --> 01:49:01.463]  Conveniently, supposedly died in a World Trade Center collapse.
[01:49:02.544 --> 01:49:06.746]  But W1999, here's what AFP said about it.
[01:49:07.472 --> 01:49:10.493]  America itself was to blame for the events of September 11 because the U.S.
[01:49:10.533 --> 01:49:16.076]  administration was using kid gloves and tracking down Osama Bin Laden and other fanatics linked to Al-Qaeda.
[01:49:18.477 --> 01:49:25.400]  A special BBC investigation into the damning incident of the two President Bushes in American foreign policy.
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:32.563]  The report which the BBC says was based on a secret FBI document numbered 199WF213589 and emanating out of the FBI's Washington office
[01:49:36.761 --> 01:49:39.683]  And it goes on into what it did, ordering them not to stop Al Qaeda.
[01:49:41.124 --> 01:49:46.788]  And we have these articles on InfoWars.com and the 9-1-1 Government Prior Knowledge Involvement Archive.
[01:49:48.329 --> 01:49:55.554]  And the Globalists did a sloppy job of this, but they are counting on you not being able to face the horror of what they have done.
[01:49:55.574 --> 01:50:03.599]  And now I have this article out of the Chicago Sun-Times, Bush answers on 9-1-1 overdue
[01:50:06.130 --> 01:50:07.131]  Andrew Greeley.
[01:50:07.531 --> 01:50:09.292]  This is on Infowars.com.
[01:50:09.332 --> 01:50:15.574]  After the Bay of Pigs disaster when the CIA tried to invade Cuba, President John F. Kennedy took personal responsibility and ordered an independent investigation.
[01:50:15.974 --> 01:50:18.776]  In fact, the invasion has been planned during the Eisenhower administration.
[01:50:19.116 --> 01:50:21.897]  And JFK could easily have blamed the mess on the predecessor.
[01:50:23.278 --> 01:50:29.040]  After the Pearl Harbor attack, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established an investigative commission, chaired by Supreme Court Justice O.N.D.
[01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:34.883]  Roberts, a Republican who had been the prosecutor for the Teapot Dome scandal.
[01:50:36.388 --> 01:50:44.512]  And it goes on, uh, patiently, President Bush is not, uh, or patently, President Bush is not going to assume responsibility for the World Trade Center catastrophe.
[01:50:44.852 --> 01:50:47.493]  His political allies blame former President Bill Clinton.
[01:50:48.213 --> 01:50:50.394]  And when we come back, I'll tell you about what this article says.
[01:50:50.474 --> 01:50:56.657]  Folks, they can't allow even a public whitewash because this thing was so swappily done.
[01:50:58.017 --> 01:50:59.518]  And it was so big.
[01:51:00.928 --> 01:51:08.574]  But if they release the biological folks, it's going to be total hysteria, lockdown of the cities, a martial law system we are never going to come out of.
[01:51:10.055 --> 01:51:26.347]  And I beg you, listeners, to get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, to get The Masters of Terror, Part 2 of that, to get the book Descent into Tyranny, to get my videos, to make copies like America's Future Depends on it, because of the best films out there, the most hard-hitting, the best documented, they're waking people up en masse,
[01:51:27.051 --> 01:51:31.055]  Get the videos, make copies, spread the truth of who's behind the terror.
[01:51:32.016 --> 01:51:33.557]  And George Bush isn't even behind it.
[01:51:33.597 --> 01:51:34.698]  Bill Clinton isn't behind it.
[01:51:34.739 --> 01:51:35.940]  These guys are just puppets.
[01:51:36.020 --> 01:51:40.384]  The shadow government, the military-industrial complex owned by the big banks is.
[01:51:42.106 --> 01:51:43.487]  We have got to speak out.
[01:51:43.527 --> 01:51:46.490]  We have got to tell the truth or it's over for America.

[01:53:21.092 --> 01:53:22.193]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.853 --> 01:53:23.994]  Government cover-ups.

[01:53:45.023 --> 01:53:45.864]  Please stay with us.
[01:53:47.104 --> 01:53:49.445]  The toll-free number to join me on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:49.485 --> 01:53:51.565]  We are live the 27th of May, 2003.
[01:53:51.605 --> 01:53:52.506]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:53:52.546 --> 01:53:54.726]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:03.106 --> 01:54:04.267]  We're about to go to your calls.
[01:54:04.287 --> 01:54:05.407]  I'm going to get into more detail.
[01:54:05.467 --> 01:54:08.289]  I tried to hurry through this last hour and didn't cover it properly.
[01:54:08.669 --> 01:54:09.429]  Classified.
[01:54:09.529 --> 01:54:11.470]  Censoring a report about 9-1-1.
[01:54:11.610 --> 01:54:18.934]  Bush officials are refusing to permit the release of matters already in the public domain, including the existence of intelligence documents referring to the CIA website.
[01:54:20.315 --> 01:54:22.176]  Bush answers on 9-1-1 overdue.
[01:54:22.216 --> 01:54:23.296]  Chicago Sun-Times.
[01:54:24.037 --> 01:54:27.178]  Syrian leader questions Al-Qaeda existence.
[01:54:28.399 --> 01:54:28.779]  The best
[01:54:29.594 --> 01:54:32.055]  Connected Investor in America is the Carlisle Group.
[01:54:32.095 --> 01:54:33.156]  Talk about their scams.
[01:54:34.736 --> 01:54:37.397]  Ex-minister held in child sex ring case.
[01:54:37.437 --> 01:54:38.278]  Went to hear about this.
[01:54:38.958 --> 01:54:41.459]  Probe into Happy Pill after spat of suicides.
[01:54:41.479 --> 01:54:45.721]  Government bows to pressure over Prozac and Cerax.
[01:54:46.441 --> 01:54:48.762]  DNA sweep in Toronto alarms many.
[01:54:48.782 --> 01:54:50.003]  Door-to-door blood grabbing.
[01:54:50.403 --> 01:54:53.724]  Labor faces ID card rebellion over the national ID card in England.
[01:54:54.504 --> 01:54:57.866]  Drone Research looks at traffic applications.
[01:55:00.106 --> 01:55:03.447]  It's not about watching the border of the illegals, as they've said, it's about watching you.
[01:55:05.388 --> 01:55:06.368]  It's all coming up.
[01:55:06.468 --> 01:55:15.871]  I know we've got many callers that are patiently holding, and we're going to get to you right now, Jan and Wyatt and Harold and others.
[01:55:16.753 --> 01:55:17.434]  Or is it Howard?
[01:55:17.494 --> 01:55:18.034]  I don't know.
[01:55:18.815 --> 01:55:21.677]  John, as well, stay right there.
[01:55:21.697 --> 01:55:24.479]  But right now, let's talk to Jan in Florida.
[01:55:24.519 --> 01:55:25.440]  Jan, you're on the air.
[01:55:25.460 --> 01:55:26.060]  Thanks for holding.
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:27.561]  Hi, thank you very much.
[01:55:28.722 --> 01:55:37.749]  My concern is the Christian manipulation.
[01:55:37.809 --> 01:55:42.112]  Christians are being manipulated and used and misrepresented.
[01:55:42.492 --> 01:55:44.834]  Why is Bush playing up to the Christians
[01:55:45.954 --> 01:55:50.997]  If we're supposed to be represented as the enemy of the government?
[01:55:51.218 --> 01:55:58.102]  Or is he just manipulating the Christians into anti-government sentiments and then trying to blame us?
[01:55:58.662 --> 01:56:01.224]  Okay, it's more sophisticated than that.
[01:56:01.524 --> 01:56:10.130]  You're talking about the FBI training manuals, the video of FEMA we have in the road to tyranny, where they say Christians and the Founding Fathers and homeschoolers are terrorists.
[01:56:10.911 --> 01:56:20.733]  That's being done quietly by the police and the military in FEMA, with the police, training them with the Southern Poverty Law Center ADL line.
[01:56:21.733 --> 01:56:22.153]  Okay?
[01:56:23.233 --> 01:56:37.616]  Then, generally, Bush then says, Oh Christians, I care about you and your values, while he expands the BATF, while he gets rid of the borders, while he doubles the size of the Department of Education, while he tries to take over the churches with a faith-based initiative.
[01:56:38.217 --> 01:56:39.578]  So there's two types of churches.
[01:56:39.598 --> 01:56:45.120]  There's those big ones that are paid off by the government and basically say that George Bush is the savior.
[01:56:45.220 --> 01:56:46.480]  I've even heard some of them imply that.
[01:56:47.161 --> 01:56:50.602]  Godly man and cover up Bohemian Grove in skull and bones.
[01:56:51.002 --> 01:56:57.145]  Then you have the real Christians, the conservative homeschooling type, who they're worried about, who know who they are.
[01:56:57.505 --> 01:56:59.526]  They're quietly demonizing that group.
[01:56:59.826 --> 01:57:04.128]  There's probably only been ten mainstream news articles about it in the last year and we have all of them in the films.
[01:57:04.908 --> 01:57:06.709]  So that's being quietly done.
[01:57:07.583 --> 01:57:08.723]  And it's being expanded.
[01:57:08.743 --> 01:57:11.784]  The Clinton program is being expanded under Bush like every other Clinton program.
[01:57:12.784 --> 01:57:17.765]  Yeah, but aren't Christians playing right into their hands by their rhetoric?
[01:57:18.346 --> 01:57:27.968]  Well, not deceived Christians who just go to church on Sunday, but who are corrupt and don't even know what the Bill of Rights is.
[01:57:28.832 --> 01:57:35.577]  Those that are following the false prophets are, that Christ warned us about, but no, real Christians are the greatest enemy of the New World Order.
[01:57:35.818 --> 01:57:37.459]  That's why they're quietly demonizing them.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:41.342]  I mean, take Fox News.
[01:57:41.662 --> 01:57:47.947]  They act like they're all conservative and Christian and like Christians, but meanwhile they've got the most evil shows on their network.
[01:57:48.527 --> 01:57:50.329]  See, it's a multi-faceted attack.
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:55.683]  Okay, but you don't think that Christians are basically playing into their hands?
[01:57:56.204 --> 01:58:01.549]  Well, I said mainstream... Like the public, like the Jerry Falwell types in the public... Ma'am, ma'am, stay there.
[01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:03.451]  I'll talk to you on the... Don't hang up, okay?
[01:58:04.172 --> 01:58:05.313]  I'll talk to you on the other side about this.
[01:58:05.333 --> 01:58:06.294]  This is an important issue.
[01:58:06.655 --> 01:58:08.857]  Perhaps other callers want to chime in on this.
[01:58:08.877 --> 01:58:08.917]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:17.233 --> 01:58:20.877]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[01:58:21.017 --> 01:58:25.402]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:58:25.603 --> 01:58:30.068]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[01:58:30.248 --> 01:58:33.231]  There are no moving parts and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[01:58:33.512 --> 01:58:38.077]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[01:58:38.397 --> 01:58:42.279]  Made of the finest materials, it has a two-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:44.921]  And the Aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[01:58:45.221 --> 01:58:49.084]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[01:58:49.344 --> 01:58:54.547]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[01:58:54.747 --> 01:58:57.689]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[01:58:57.849 --> 01:58:59.710]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[01:58:59.930 --> 01:59:04.553]  For more information about the Aeronizer, call Toll Free and tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[01:59:04.753 --> 01:59:07.934]  The toll-free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[01:59:08.354 --> 01:59:11.355]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:59:11.715 --> 01:59:22.879]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:23.119 --> 01:59:27.860]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:33.742]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:33.962 --> 01:59:38.505]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:59:38.725 --> 01:59:45.869]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:59:45.909 --> 01:59:50.111]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:59:50.591 --> 01:59:53.113]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:59:53.333 --> 02:00:00.098]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:00:14.346 --> 02:00:15.307]  Toxins are everywhere.
[02:00:15.367 --> 02:00:25.933]  They're in the air you breathe, in the food you eat, in the water you drink, and as a result, illness and disease have increased to the point that eventually we're all going to get sick with something, unless we find a way to get these toxins and metals out of the body.
[02:00:26.393 --> 02:00:31.896]  EDTA chelation treatments cost about $100 each, and take several hours at the doctor's office, not to mention the discomfort.
[02:00:32.216 --> 02:00:33.677]  But now, there's Detoximate.
[02:00:34.037 --> 02:00:39.140]  This chelation suppository is a major breakthrough and is destined to revolutionize the way we detox our bodies.
[02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:41.341]  How much would you pay for 10 chelation treatments?
[02:00:41.621 --> 02:00:44.023]  Well, you can get approximately the same amount of chelating for only $289.95.
[02:00:45.764 --> 02:00:47.465]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:00:47.945 --> 02:00:49.566]  That's 877-817-9829.

[02:01:15.084 --> 02:01:20.127]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:20.488 --> 02:01:22.789]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:01:48.259 --> 02:01:50.640]  Alright folks, we're talking to Jan in Florida.
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:56.201]  And Jan, you were continuing talking about Christians.
[02:01:57.512 --> 02:02:00.153]  That Christians are playing into the hands of the New World Order.
[02:02:00.173 --> 02:02:03.354]  Can you elaborate on your point and what you're getting at?
[02:02:04.375 --> 02:02:05.055]  Okay.
[02:02:05.655 --> 02:02:16.579]  People like the individuals who came out after 9-11 and said, God takes his protecting hand off of America because we're so sinful and we're so evil.
[02:02:17.380 --> 02:02:26.103]  And there's anti-liberals, you know, Clinton's bad, Bush is good, type of thing.
[02:02:27.126 --> 02:02:35.077]  Uh, and if you're, you know, if you're for Bush, you're a Christian, and if you're for Clinton, you're a, uh, for any other liberal politician, you're, you know, an atheist and everything.
[02:02:35.918 --> 02:02:37.500]  Uh, isn't this just being manipulated?
[02:02:38.081 --> 02:02:43.688]  I mean, if it's not a liberal conservative issue, uh, point to start with, uh, it doesn't really matter.
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:46.840]  Well, absolutely.
[02:02:46.880 --> 02:02:48.301]  I mean, you've hit on a big point here.
[02:02:48.941 --> 02:02:57.263]  Bill Clinton is evil, is corrupt, but he's just a puppet, just like George W. Bush and George Herbert Walker Bush and the rest of them.
[02:02:57.283 --> 02:03:00.744]  They don't own and run the New World Order, the big European banks do.
[02:03:00.844 --> 02:03:13.247]  But, when the Christian politicians, and that's really what they are, these big good time folks that are getting all the federal funds now, when they came out and they said,
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:17.861]  This is a holy war and you're with the devil if you're against it.
[02:03:17.981 --> 02:03:18.961]  That was a fraud.
[02:03:19.021 --> 02:03:29.504]  But when they said that God has taken his protection away from America and allowed these attacks to take place, because we have become a corrupt and decadent nation on average, that was true.
[02:03:30.764 --> 02:03:32.184]  It's a scientific fact.
[02:03:32.584 --> 02:03:33.705]  You reap what you sow.
[02:03:34.625 --> 02:03:41.266]  When you become corrupt, when you become decadent, when you become ignorant and dumbed down, then people are able to run scams on you.
[02:03:41.566 --> 02:03:43.887]  And so when Jerry Falwell got criticized for saying that,
[02:03:44.905 --> 02:03:46.006]  I said, how ridiculous!
[02:03:46.046 --> 02:03:47.128]  That makes perfect sense.
[02:03:47.188 --> 02:03:49.770]  So, Fulwell is right on that issue.
[02:03:50.371 --> 02:03:54.175]  He's wrong about saying George Bush is godly and this war is holy.
[02:03:54.595 --> 02:03:58.179]  So they tell you some truth, but a lot of it is mixed with lies.
[02:03:59.230 --> 02:04:02.012]  So, Jan, that's what they're doing here.
[02:04:02.052 --> 02:04:06.714]  Now, real Christians, you said, well, why are Christians being demonized by the FBI?
[02:04:07.254 --> 02:04:17.400]  Those are homeschooling, Bible-believing people that actually know the Bill of Rights and Constitution, people that know that Bush is a big government takeover Trojan horse.
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:23.103]  The FBI, FEMA, others, they're running around the police department saying, these people are bad.
[02:04:23.643 --> 02:04:26.145]  They're not worried about the big church on the corner.
[02:04:26.818 --> 02:04:33.480]  Where, you know, they basically say George Bush is God's vicar on Earth, like he's the new Pope or something.
[02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:41.763]  That is the establishment taking over, basically, Pharisees and Sadducees, as it was in the Bible, so it is today.
[02:04:42.143 --> 02:04:48.705]  Christ said you'd mainly have false prophets and people out there giving you the government line, like the Pharisees were doing for Caesar.
[02:04:49.705 --> 02:04:51.086]  So, that's what we have.
[02:04:51.446 --> 02:04:52.466]  As it was 2,000 years ago, it is today.
[02:04:55.490 --> 02:05:19.160]  So that's what we're dealing with right now, and these churches are being told to lay down, to go along with the corruption, to give up your rights, or the liberals will get you, when in truth, when it comes to real policy on trade and open borders and globalism and confiscating our guns, Bush and Clinton are totally on the same page.
[02:05:20.697 --> 02:05:21.839]  Does that answer your question?
[02:05:22.299 --> 02:05:26.906]  Okay, so it's really, this is a very new thing to me, and so I'm just getting into this.
[02:05:27.127 --> 02:05:31.774]  Yeah, they've always tried to manage the paradigms, but look, open borders, Clinton and Bush are the same.
[02:05:32.094 --> 02:05:33.737]  NAFTA and GATT, Clinton and Bush are the same.
[02:05:33.997 --> 02:05:36.381]  Supercomputers are Communist China, Clinton and Bush are the same.
[02:05:36.989 --> 02:05:40.051]  Okay, so it really doesn't matter if you vote liberal or conservative, it has nothing to do with
[02:06:05.962 --> 02:06:22.773]  I would vote for the candidate with their Libertarian, Democrat, Republican, Constitutional Party, Reform Party, locally in your area, who has a record for lower government, pro-Second Amendment, pro-sovereignty, who wants to get rid of NAFTA and GATT that has totally shut down our economy.
[02:06:23.013 --> 02:06:25.755]  Okay, so look at their records, start listening to their rhetoric.
[02:06:26.511 --> 02:06:27.411]  Exactly.
[02:06:27.871 --> 02:06:28.351]  Okay.
[02:06:28.412 --> 02:06:31.592]  And politics is boring because the average American knows it's a fraud.
[02:06:31.712 --> 02:06:32.873]  Oh, it doesn't matter who's in there.
[02:06:33.333 --> 02:06:38.214]  But if you get outside the paradigm and understand how it's really run, it becomes very exciting.
[02:06:38.874 --> 02:06:39.114]  Okay.
[02:06:39.634 --> 02:06:40.134]  Thanks for the call.
[02:06:40.154 --> 02:06:40.474]  Thank you.
[02:06:40.874 --> 02:06:41.715]  I appreciated that.
[02:06:42.415 --> 02:06:43.475]  Wyatt in Maryland.
[02:06:43.555 --> 02:06:44.475]  Wyatt, you're on the air.
[02:06:44.535 --> 02:06:44.935]  Go ahead.
[02:06:46.356 --> 02:06:47.096]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:06:47.236 --> 02:06:48.236]  How you doing, my friend?
[02:06:48.536 --> 02:06:48.996]  Terrific.
[02:06:49.977 --> 02:06:51.797]  Listen, I've got a couple things I'd like to cover.
[02:06:52.847 --> 02:07:02.052]  I was listening to C-SPAN radio on the public hearing coverage of the Council on Foreign Relations Board that's investigating the 9-11.
[02:07:03.093 --> 02:07:05.494]  And there's a guest I think that you should try and get.
[02:07:05.554 --> 02:07:08.736]  She was Assistant Secretary to Transportation.
[02:07:09.156 --> 02:07:10.917]  Her name is Mary Schiavo.
[02:07:11.837 --> 02:07:16.640]  And when she was, as she was being introduced by the panel,
[02:07:17.959 --> 02:07:23.621]  They made it a point to say, oh, she has prior engagement, so she can only speak for three minutes.
[02:07:24.021 --> 02:07:27.042]  They made it a point before she ever said a word to say this.
[02:07:27.723 --> 02:07:32.824]  Then they said, she has a report handed to us.
[02:07:33.305 --> 02:07:39.147]  So then they went to her, introduced her, and she said, yes, I'd like to do a summary of my report.
[02:07:39.927 --> 02:07:41.828]  Then she went beyond three minutes, and she was
[02:07:46.644 --> 02:07:58.835]  Laying it all out about everything that went wrong with 9-11 that is proving to be lies that the administration has said.
[02:07:58.855 --> 02:08:00.876]  And they caught her off.
[02:08:01.257 --> 02:08:03.298]  They said, you've gone over your three minutes.
[02:08:03.699 --> 02:08:04.880]  She went about five minutes.
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:08.002]  But she was laying it all out, and I think she really wants to speak.
[02:08:08.543 --> 02:08:10.264]  I think she needs a forum to speak in.
[02:08:11.245 --> 02:08:14.308]  Her name is Mary Schiavo, but I do not know how to get a hold of her.
[02:08:15.131 --> 02:08:16.952]  And she was the former what?
[02:08:17.352 --> 02:08:20.933]  Former Assistant Secretary to Transportation.
[02:08:21.514 --> 02:08:22.614]  And she wanted to speak.
[02:08:22.654 --> 02:08:23.855]  I could tell she wanted to speak.
[02:08:23.895 --> 02:08:25.595]  She wanted to lay it out.
[02:08:26.015 --> 02:08:27.116]  And they rushed it.
[02:08:27.156 --> 02:08:29.397]  They gave it a bum's rush on and off.
[02:08:29.877 --> 02:08:31.358]  Because they knew she would open up.
[02:08:32.198 --> 02:08:37.280]  And I think it's a... So if you can possibly... I'll try and find a way to get in touch with her.
[02:08:37.540 --> 02:08:39.341]  Yeah, and for those that don't know,
[02:08:40.194 --> 02:08:42.636]  These panels have been CFR panels.
[02:08:42.676 --> 02:08:43.997]  They're all CFR members.
[02:08:44.377 --> 02:08:47.740]  They're having staged meetings, staged people.
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:54.265]  But in these last few hearings, they always have somebody that slips through that's causing them big problems.
[02:08:54.485 --> 02:08:54.705]  Right.
[02:08:54.785 --> 02:08:55.565]  And she's one of them.
[02:08:55.585 --> 02:08:57.567]  And I think she really needs a forum to speak in.
[02:08:58.187 --> 02:08:58.828]  Another topic.
[02:08:59.575 --> 02:09:16.290]  I got a questionnaire from my House of Representatives Socialist Communist Ben Cardin from Maryland here and it's a 19 question questionnaire that you're supposed to answer yes or no to and send it back.
[02:09:16.750 --> 02:09:21.054]  I'll just give you three examples of the types of questions that they want you to answer yes or no to.
[02:09:21.710 --> 02:09:27.112]  Should the federal government restrict travel to countries that have large SARS outbreaks?
[02:09:27.472 --> 02:09:29.933]  Isn't that amazing that SARS has made this publication?
[02:09:30.853 --> 02:09:31.594]  Another one.
[02:09:31.994 --> 02:09:37.796]  Does the color-coded Homeland Security Advisory System provide useful information to you?
[02:09:38.176 --> 02:09:39.397]  Of course not!
[02:09:41.057 --> 02:09:42.318]  Here's another one.
[02:09:43.018 --> 02:09:43.938]  Should the U.S.
[02:09:44.018 --> 02:09:47.940]  government be able to indefinitely detain a suspected terrorist?
[02:09:48.345 --> 02:09:53.489]  This is the kind of stuff that they're asking the average idiot citizen to answer yes or no to.
[02:09:54.369 --> 02:10:01.554]  And then when the average person goes, yeah, detain those citizens for our safety, they'll go, look, it's a democracy.
[02:10:02.395 --> 02:10:05.897]  This flyer we sent out, they say they want it.
[02:10:05.977 --> 02:10:07.178]  No, in a republic,
[02:10:07.879 --> 02:10:14.023]  In a democracy, if 51% say kill all white people, kill all black people, kill all redheads, it happens.
[02:10:14.143 --> 02:10:19.826]  In a republic, they're protected by a rule of law by the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:10:19.846 --> 02:10:22.688]  Well, these questions are just unbelievable.
[02:10:22.728 --> 02:10:26.070]  I just read a few ones that I thought were important.
[02:10:27.971 --> 02:10:37.477]  It's really interesting because Monday, I opened up my mail from the weekend and I have a thing from a local group that's teaching the Constitution here in Maryland.
[02:10:38.224 --> 02:10:44.946]  And they have about a hundred or so people come all the time, and it's really growing.
[02:10:45.366 --> 02:11:00.529]  But it was a Patrick Henry speech from before the second Virginia Convention, March 23rd, 1775, even before the outbreak of the Revolution.
[02:11:01.069 --> 02:11:04.450]  And just let me, one little short passage.
[02:11:05.023 --> 02:11:17.636]  It says, he says, shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying sublimely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot?
[02:11:18.351 --> 02:11:25.473]  Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our powers.
[02:11:25.893 --> 02:11:38.017]  The millions of people armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us.
[02:11:38.997 --> 02:11:40.358]  And that's what we need today.
[02:11:43.317 --> 02:11:44.057]  Well, I know this.
[02:11:44.117 --> 02:11:46.118]  That's why they call Patrick Henry a terrorist.
[02:11:46.198 --> 02:11:57.443]  Because the Declaration of Independence says, we run this country, we have the right to defend ourselves and to throw the creatures out if they become destructive of liberty and freedom.
[02:11:57.723 --> 02:12:00.544]  And that has now obviously happened, Wyatt.
[02:12:00.604 --> 02:12:03.026]  And they, the globalists, are the enemy combatants.
[02:12:03.466 --> 02:12:04.586]  They are the enemy force.
[02:12:04.786 --> 02:12:05.687]  They are the terrorists.
[02:12:06.067 --> 02:12:10.169]  They are the usurpers destroying this constitutional republic.
[02:12:10.529 --> 02:12:10.949]  That's right.
[02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:21.013]  Alex, like you say, if they come by, if they once again do another terrorist attack on us, it'll be huge.
[02:12:21.133 --> 02:12:24.235]  It'll be something that the people, just like the SARS, people are frightened.
[02:12:24.275 --> 02:12:25.495]  It's something they can't see.
[02:12:25.895 --> 02:12:27.296]  SARS is just a warm-up.
[02:12:28.362 --> 02:12:41.832]  Yes, but I can't believe that 150,000 people a year in this country die from botched operations, or wrong anesthesia, or wrong prescriptions.
[02:12:42.653 --> 02:12:44.875]  35,000 to 36,000 from the flu.
[02:12:45.215 --> 02:12:46.356]  Right, from the flu alone.
[02:12:46.696 --> 02:12:51.260]  Yet, in this questionnaire that just came out, he's asking about SARS.
[02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:56.023]  So it's already been pushed in the forefront for us to swallow and to digest.
[02:12:58.345 --> 02:13:00.426]  Wyatt, who launched the anthrax attack?
[02:13:00.726 --> 02:13:01.847]  Oh, well, the CIA did.
[02:13:01.887 --> 02:13:02.927]  The Cornelists did.
[02:13:02.967 --> 02:13:08.169]  And the whole cabinet and the president were on SEPARO four weeks before it first showed up in Boca Raton.
[02:13:09.010 --> 02:13:10.911]  Harold, or is it Howard in Missouri?
[02:13:10.931 --> 02:13:13.192]  When we get back, other calls and a bunch of other news.
[02:13:13.572 --> 02:13:14.012]  Stay with me.
[02:13:16.710 --> 02:13:21.233]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:13:21.573 --> 02:13:25.676]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:13:25.956 --> 02:13:26.497]  We listened.
[02:13:26.817 --> 02:13:31.800]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:13:32.080 --> 02:13:32.561]  We listened.
[02:13:32.941 --> 02:13:35.983]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:13:36.403 --> 02:13:36.944]  We listened.
[02:13:37.404 --> 02:13:40.486]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:13:40.486 --> 02:13:41.087]  I think so.
[02:14:08.032 --> 02:14:11.314]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:14:11.774 --> 02:14:13.175]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:14:15.457 --> 02:14:17.478]  Your beliefs and opinions are attacked constantly.
[02:14:17.618 --> 02:14:21.621]  Media, press, and government support even perpetrate lies to degrade your rights and independence.
[02:14:21.841 --> 02:14:25.564]  The liberally biased populist assaults your mind in order to take advantage of your soul.

[02:14:52.039 --> 02:14:52.279]  I think so.
[02:15:16.508 --> 02:15:21.012]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:15:21.352 --> 02:15:25.456]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:15:25.736 --> 02:15:26.297]  We listened.
[02:15:26.597 --> 02:15:31.581]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:15:31.861 --> 02:15:32.342]  We listened.
[02:15:32.722 --> 02:15:35.765]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:15:36.205 --> 02:15:36.726]  We listened.
[02:15:37.186 --> 02:15:40.589]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:15:40.629 --> 02:15:41.149]  We're good to go.
[02:16:07.085 --> 02:16:08.066]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.

[02:17:41.169 --> 02:17:42.030]  Central Standard Time.
[02:17:42.050 --> 02:17:51.914]  I want to thank the sponsors, the listeners, all the great AM and FM affiliates and Shortwave as well, the folks running the internet, Rod over at m2ktalk.com.
[02:17:52.635 --> 02:17:53.055]  I want to thank
[02:17:54.182 --> 02:18:02.549]  Mark and Paul and Matt and Ted Anderson and Michael Trudeau and everybody that makes this network possible.
[02:18:02.609 --> 02:18:03.190]  God bless you.
[02:18:03.210 --> 02:18:04.551]  We're doing really important things here.
[02:18:05.091 --> 02:18:06.973]  More of that news coming up that I mentioned earlier.
[02:18:07.013 --> 02:18:08.114]  You don't want to miss it, believe me.
[02:18:08.154 --> 02:18:09.635]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[02:18:10.516 --> 02:18:12.938]  Howard in Missouri, then Bill in New Jersey.
[02:18:12.958 --> 02:18:13.939]  You're up next.
[02:18:13.999 --> 02:18:14.800]  Howard, go ahead.
[02:18:15.060 --> 02:18:15.560]  Yes, sir.
[02:18:15.901 --> 02:18:17.362]  Mr. Alex Jones.
[02:18:18.460 --> 02:18:27.728]  I have recently been reading in 2 Chronicles 2311, and you know, they anointed a son of a king, you know.
[02:18:27.748 --> 02:18:30.470]  They said, God save the king, you know.
[02:18:32.152 --> 02:18:37.256]  And so, I don't know if you're familiar with 2 Chronicles 2311.
[02:18:38.677 --> 02:18:39.959]  Okay.
[02:18:40.779 --> 02:18:46.764]  But the idea is, I've got a book here that says, The True Story of the Seventh in Line to the British Crown.
[02:18:48.109 --> 02:18:53.992]  In that book, there's pictures of the mother and the queen mother, and they all kind of look like the Bush family, you know.
[02:18:54.832 --> 02:19:00.255]  And of course, I know that the Constitution was... You're talking about British Israelism?
[02:19:01.135 --> 02:19:02.055]  Well, that's possible.
[02:19:02.456 --> 02:19:09.079]  But, you know, in the Bible, it talks about how they anointed the king and gave him the testimonies.
[02:19:09.179 --> 02:19:11.040]  And it was the Constitution.
[02:19:11.060 --> 02:19:14.101]  You know how they're tearing up the Constitution and manipulating it?
[02:19:14.818 --> 02:19:21.960]  Maybe we should forsake the Constitution and go with the King in this country, and we should say, God save George W. Bush, you know?
[02:19:22.380 --> 02:19:24.441]  King George, you know?
[02:19:24.501 --> 02:19:30.322]  So will we say that if Hitler was in Germany, let's go ahead, the Bible says, follow Hitler?
[02:19:30.642 --> 02:19:31.863]  A lot of people liked Hitler.
[02:19:32.623 --> 02:19:33.963]  You know, in Germany they did.
[02:19:34.283 --> 02:19:34.943]  I don't know why.
[02:19:35.204 --> 02:19:44.046]  And I'll tell you what I think, yeah, that's another story about, I think, Deuteronomy 23.2, about, you know, how illegitimate children weren't allowed into the
[02:19:44.730 --> 02:19:46.671]  Congregation of God for 10 generations.
[02:19:46.731 --> 02:19:48.032]  It was a Jewish law, you know?
[02:19:48.613 --> 02:19:49.213]  Deuteronomy 23, 2.
[02:19:50.454 --> 02:19:51.615]  But that's the Old Testament.
[02:19:51.635 --> 02:19:52.796]  We have the New Testament.
[02:19:53.296 --> 02:19:53.876]  That's right.
[02:19:54.016 --> 02:19:54.657]  I'm going to let you go.
[02:19:54.717 --> 02:19:56.238]  I appreciate the call.
[02:19:57.039 --> 02:20:01.201]  Yeah, render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, the things to God that are God's.
[02:20:01.682 --> 02:20:05.584]  Folks, Hitler used that line, and people take the Bible out of context.
[02:20:06.985 --> 02:20:08.727]  Should people in Russia follow Stalin?
[02:20:08.747 --> 02:20:09.727]  What about Mao Zedong?
[02:20:09.747 --> 02:20:10.148]  What about Nero?
[02:20:12.079 --> 02:20:13.139]  Supposed to follow Nero?
[02:20:13.339 --> 02:20:14.179]  No, my friends.
[02:20:14.199 --> 02:20:16.100]  You're supposed to stand up against evil.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:17.920]  You're supposed to defend your family.
[02:20:17.980 --> 02:20:18.780]  Those are commandments.
[02:20:20.361 --> 02:20:21.821]  It's common sense, folks.
[02:20:22.021 --> 02:20:22.841]  Common sense.
[02:20:23.821 --> 02:20:26.682]  And you're talking about the churches being controlled.
[02:20:26.702 --> 02:20:28.982]  I mean, they basically say, follow the leader.
[02:20:29.002 --> 02:20:30.483]  Of course, they didn't say that under Bill Clinton.
[02:20:32.263 --> 02:20:32.843]  It's incredible.
[02:20:32.883 --> 02:20:38.944]  I mean, if our founding fathers would have had that attitude, we never would have defeated the crown and gotten some freedom.
[02:20:39.865 --> 02:20:41.265]  But this whole line about
[02:20:41.983 --> 02:20:45.069]  You know, the leaders being God, or God's vessels.
[02:20:45.129 --> 02:20:51.000]  I guess Pol Pot was, or Ho Chi Minh, or any of these people.
[02:20:52.262 --> 02:20:54.005]  What about this story I've got right here?
[02:20:55.191 --> 02:20:56.952]  This is a story out of the London Guardian.
[02:20:56.992 --> 02:21:00.314]  Maybe people shouldn't criticize him because he's a government official.
[02:21:00.835 --> 02:21:03.417]  Ex-minister held in child sex ring case.
[02:21:03.837 --> 02:21:15.324]  Portugal's spiraling pedophilia scandal has threatened to engulf the nation's elite after the arrest of a top politician and a warning from judges that the arrest of more members of parliament could be imminent.
[02:21:15.505 --> 02:21:20.468]  Socialist politicians have claimed that they are part of a witch hunt after the arrest of the official spokesman Pablo
[02:21:21.559 --> 02:21:27.043]  Pedrisso on 15 charges of sexual abuse of minors following a phone tape conversation by police.
[02:21:27.704 --> 02:21:34.069]  The trial of a top TV presenter, a former ambassador, and a leading children's health expert on similar charges is expected to start soon.
[02:21:35.730 --> 02:21:42.676]  So I guess, in Florida, where you have the head of the database as a convicted pedophile over the CPS grabbing kids, hey!
[02:21:43.717 --> 02:21:45.318]  You know, he's part of the government, man!
[02:21:45.378 --> 02:21:46.619]  Don't criticize him!
[02:21:47.660 --> 02:21:48.701]  Bible says so!
[02:21:48.841 --> 02:21:50.102]  No, it doesn't say so.
[02:21:51.514 --> 02:21:51.954]  Okay?
[02:21:53.955 --> 02:22:04.241]  And Hitler said, oh, the Bible says, rendered unto Caesar, folks, Christ is saying this money doesn't matter, their systems are fraud, fine, let them have their system, is what Christ was saying.
[02:22:06.142 --> 02:22:19.169]  So, yes, I have heard Christian broadcasters, who aren't really Christian, saying we should give up our rights, that we've got to give up our rights, that Bush is ordained by God, that he's this big Christian, and they're ignoring the fact that he's a Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove member.
[02:22:19.795 --> 02:22:21.936]  You know, didn't the Bible warn us about false prophets?
[02:22:22.577 --> 02:22:28.240]  Didn't it tell us that Satan himself, masquerades as an angel of light, can quote scripture at you?
[02:22:29.141 --> 02:22:31.702]  No, the Bible does not say, go along with evil leaders.
[02:22:32.903 --> 02:22:35.665]  The Bible is full of evil governments and evil countries being punished.
[02:22:35.945 --> 02:22:37.085]  It's historical fact!
[02:22:37.125 --> 02:22:38.166]  You reap what you sow!
[02:22:39.967 --> 02:22:42.108]  And, do away with our Constitution!
[02:22:42.209 --> 02:22:43.209]  Make Bush King!
[02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:46.211]  This is being spoken all over the country!
[02:22:47.312 --> 02:22:49.353]  But, the type of people that believe this,
[02:22:51.198 --> 02:22:55.981]  Aren't active, and are basically just minions, and they don't even count their furniture.
[02:22:56.782 --> 02:23:00.744]  I hope you weren't saying this, sir, but I understand the point we're making, because I've heard it before.
[02:23:01.765 --> 02:23:03.046]  We have federally funded churches.
[02:23:03.066 --> 02:23:04.286]  We're going to be hearing a lot more.
[02:23:04.326 --> 02:23:04.987]  More calls coming up.
[02:23:05.727 --> 02:23:06.648]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.128 --> 02:23:08.749]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.650 --> 02:23:12.332]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.806 --> 02:23:19.708]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:23:19.888 --> 02:23:25.391]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious, crystal-clear drinking water.
[02:23:25.651 --> 02:23:26.192]  Ideal for... 803-4438.
[02:23:26.232 --> 02:23:27.693]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:23:27.933 --> 02:23:28.833]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:23:46.571 --> 02:23:47.552]  Alright, we're back live.
[02:23:47.592 --> 02:23:50.954]  Let's go to Mellon, New Jersey, then I'm diving back into the news and into more calls.
[02:23:51.074 --> 02:23:51.975]  Bill, you're on the air.
[02:23:52.015 --> 02:23:52.355]  Welcome.
[02:23:52.736 --> 02:23:56.438]  Yeah, Alex, I want you to calm down and relax, because this is going to get you very upset.
[02:23:57.199 --> 02:23:58.420]  I was listening to 770 AM.
[02:23:58.500 --> 02:24:06.425]  Sir, sir, I don't want to plug other people's radio shows, especially if they're attacking us, but you were listening to a radio station.
[02:24:06.445 --> 02:24:06.766]  Go ahead.
[02:24:06.946 --> 02:24:11.789]  Okay, a talk show host on the overnight, a caller brought up Iran-Contra.
[02:24:12.130 --> 02:24:15.372]  Okay, and you remember Oliver North talking about Bin Laden.
[02:24:15.879 --> 02:24:18.280]  Okay, and I don't remember the Senator.
[02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:21.901]  They said it was Senator Al Gore making fun of Bin Laden's name.
[02:24:21.921 --> 02:24:22.821]  You remember that, right?
[02:24:22.841 --> 02:24:24.281]  Uh, yes, sir.
[02:24:24.561 --> 02:24:32.683]  Okay, this talk show host says, well, that wasn't Bin Laden Oliver North was talking about on Nationwide Coast to Coast AM.
[02:24:33.864 --> 02:24:37.224]  Okay, he says, well, it was some other terrorist and all that stuff.
[02:24:37.244 --> 02:24:38.385]  That's all a bunch of lies.
[02:24:38.445 --> 02:24:39.225]  None of it's true.
[02:24:40.545 --> 02:24:43.446]  Okay, this is on the biggest station in New York City.
[02:24:43.874 --> 02:24:55.299]  Well, the Senate report in 99 by Republicans says Bin Laden in 98 was used with the CIA to attack the Serbs to get that war started.
[02:24:55.399 --> 02:25:00.262]  They admit that Bin Laden's group was founded by the CIA.
[02:25:00.322 --> 02:25:06.465]  They admit they flew 8,000 of them out to safety in 2001 and 2002 in the war in Afghanistan.
[02:25:06.505 --> 02:25:08.826]  They admit they paid for the hijackers' homes.
[02:25:09.777 --> 02:25:11.938]  And, uh, cars and credit cards.
[02:25:12.379 --> 02:25:14.720]  They admit public officials were told not to fly.
[02:25:14.800 --> 02:25:16.901]  They admit all of this.
[02:25:16.941 --> 02:25:22.944]  They've had, uh, press conferences with Larry Klayman, the judicial watch on C-SPAN, admitting to Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[02:25:23.745 --> 02:25:28.567]  Uh, we know the Carlisle Group and Halliburton and others do all the big contracts in the Middle East with all these people.
[02:25:29.768 --> 02:25:33.530]  So the host just denied the fact that the sun comes up in the morning, basically.
[02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:34.831]  Uh, absolutely.
[02:25:35.595 --> 02:25:36.116]  Absolutely.
[02:25:36.136 --> 02:25:40.440]  Well, it's known that Bin Laden was our big lovey-dovey asset in the 80s fighting the Soviets.
[02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:44.644]  That's a historical fact that he was the go-between bringing in CIA money.
[02:25:45.365 --> 02:25:47.807]  That's hundreds of mainstream articles in the 80s.
[02:25:47.867 --> 02:25:49.369]  He was this big hero.
[02:25:49.409 --> 02:25:50.750]  You're saying they just denied that?
[02:25:50.890 --> 02:25:54.954]  I wish I had tape rolling, but I don't have anything set up in this room.
[02:25:54.974 --> 02:25:57.817]  But I'll tell you what, if I did, I would have played it back for you.
[02:25:57.837 --> 02:26:00.039]  This was Steve Malzberg, okay?
[02:26:01.059 --> 02:26:02.740]  And he was on the overnight.
[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:11.645]  He was talking about some emails that were going around saying that they had picked up Mohammed Atta and they had him locked up and Bill Clinton had him released from jail.
[02:26:11.665 --> 02:26:14.347]  That's MSNBC.
[02:26:14.407 --> 02:26:16.849]  He says, oh well that was a different Mohammed Atta.
[02:26:16.929 --> 02:26:19.850]  He says that was the same name, he said, but it was a different guy.
[02:26:20.191 --> 02:26:20.571]  Sure.
[02:26:21.684 --> 02:26:31.692]  And another thing some of the other hosts are doing over there is they're really trying to alienate the whites away from the blacks and the Mexicans to the point where these groups of people won't speak to each other.
[02:26:31.712 --> 02:26:33.393]  Oh yeah, it's all about balkanization.
[02:26:33.833 --> 02:26:37.116]  The only conservatism they know is this balkanization.
[02:26:37.676 --> 02:26:43.461]  Now, understand there's a lot of blacks and Mexicans in the military, in the United States military.
[02:26:43.781 --> 02:26:50.346]  They think that white people are like a bunch of nobody, lame-brain, weak sissies, okay, that aren't going to do anything.
[02:26:50.954 --> 02:26:56.517]  And, uh, you know, they can keep promoting their... Monica Crawley admits that she belongs to the CFR.
[02:26:56.798 --> 02:27:01.440]  Yet, ten years ago, they would have put me in the nuthouse for mentioning, even mentioning the CFR.
[02:27:01.581 --> 02:27:05.223]  I remember five, six years ago in the air, I would say CFR and get calls.
[02:27:05.603 --> 02:27:06.383]  You're crazy.
[02:27:06.403 --> 02:27:09.045]  I heard crazy people say that exists.
[02:27:09.345 --> 02:27:11.046]  There is no New World Order.
[02:27:11.386 --> 02:27:13.888]  There isn't even a Rothschild family.
[02:27:14.328 --> 02:27:15.369]  They don't exist.
[02:27:16.871 --> 02:27:19.354]  Uh, and the last thing Alex... So that's their new policy.
[02:27:19.855 --> 02:27:23.078]  Uh, just, it just didn't happen, we don't know what you're talking about, it's made up.
[02:27:23.238 --> 02:27:28.183]  And they're going to keep repeating this and repeating it until it gets into your brain and you start believing it.
[02:27:28.664 --> 02:27:30.305]  They're just going to keep on repeating it.
[02:27:31.206 --> 02:27:36.031]  So I guess now Bin Laden never worked with the CIA and never worked with Oliver North and never did any of that.
[02:27:36.051 --> 02:27:36.692]  There you go.
[02:27:37.662 --> 02:27:38.122]  That's right.
[02:27:38.242 --> 02:27:41.724]  Okay then, I guess there weren't Senate hearings and all this stuff.
[02:27:41.764 --> 02:27:43.765]  You know, it's an absolute fact.
[02:27:44.765 --> 02:27:59.751]  Well, one thing I need you to do, if you have the time, or maybe Violet could do it, is just print up an information sheet in Spanish that I can hand to these Mexican people, because I'll tell you, the few that I talk to that speak English, they know all about what's going on.
[02:27:59.891 --> 02:28:03.893]  They said, this is what happened in Mexico 20 years ago, why do you think we're here?
[02:28:04.471 --> 02:28:10.293]  You start talking to them about the Constitution, I'll tell you what, they're going to put their drinks down and stop chattering or whatever.
[02:28:10.334 --> 02:28:11.334]  They're going to listen to you.
[02:28:11.694 --> 02:28:27.781]  Well, I know that here in Austin, probably the biggest listenership of any demographic is Hispanics, and they're very patriotic good people, and they know in major polls, now 80 plus percent of Hispanics, that we've got to shut down the borders, we've got to control the borders, north and south,
[02:28:28.627 --> 02:28:31.330]  And the media tries to make everything a racial issue.
[02:28:31.410 --> 02:28:33.012]  It's a sovereignty issue.
[02:28:33.112 --> 02:28:37.316]  It's the problems that are over there that are so bad, these people are like running for their life.
[02:28:37.376 --> 02:28:38.777]  They're not just here to make money.
[02:28:39.038 --> 02:28:40.539]  They're afraid of getting arrested again.
[02:28:40.579 --> 02:28:44.263]  Now even Mexico's industry is shutting down and going to China.
[02:28:44.523 --> 02:28:45.244]  Yeah, to China.
[02:28:46.376 --> 02:28:52.863]  Hey, what do you think of these people that say it's Christian to worship your leader and not criticize your leader?
[02:28:53.223 --> 02:28:55.285]  Yeah, that's another important thing.
[02:28:55.625 --> 02:28:58.428]  Don't put down a king just because he's king.
[02:28:59.389 --> 02:29:01.411]  He's a good king, he's a bad king.
[02:29:02.532 --> 02:29:06.976]  In my family, I have two lines of royal blood dating back I don't know how long.
[02:29:08.258 --> 02:29:11.520]  I'm not going to say the name, but he was elected by the people.
[02:29:11.820 --> 02:29:14.301]  The people held him up and they said, we want him king.
[02:29:14.321 --> 02:29:18.382]  Sir, sir, sir, this whole thing of getting rid of the Constitution and making Bush king.
[02:29:19.123 --> 02:29:22.964]  George Washington fought in the backyard of the house I grew up in.
[02:29:23.465 --> 02:29:26.146]  You read about the Battle of Monmouth.
[02:29:26.186 --> 02:29:27.466]  The British tried to run.
[02:29:27.926 --> 02:29:31.208]  They wouldn't surrender because they knew what was going to happen to them if they surrendered.
[02:29:31.248 --> 02:29:31.808]  They ran.
[02:29:32.481 --> 02:29:32.822]  Okay?
[02:29:33.022 --> 02:29:39.431]  George Washington chased after them, and there was a huge, huge British massacre in the Battle of Monmouth.
[02:29:39.451 --> 02:29:43.196]  A lot of British dead are buried not far from where I'm talking, even.
[02:29:44.137 --> 02:29:44.959]  All throughout here.
[02:29:45.519 --> 02:29:48.043]  And, you know, I grew up with this going through my head.
[02:29:48.530 --> 02:29:54.473]  You know, here we are in bed with the British again, and we're just like coddling to them, oh, because they speak English.
[02:29:54.693 --> 02:29:55.414]  I hear you.
[02:29:55.594 --> 02:29:56.894]  Sir, I appreciate the call.
[02:29:56.955 --> 02:29:59.316]  It isn't the British people, it's the British government.
[02:29:59.756 --> 02:30:02.037]  It's the banking families and royal families over there.
[02:30:02.077 --> 02:30:02.918]  I appreciate the call.
[02:30:03.378 --> 02:30:05.279]  Ruth, where are you calling us from today, ma'am?
[02:30:05.719 --> 02:30:07.300]  I'm in Monmouth County.
[02:30:07.620 --> 02:30:08.781]  Okay, sir, go ahead.
[02:30:10.962 --> 02:30:11.702]  You're on the air.
[02:30:12.903 --> 02:30:13.283]  Okay.
[02:30:13.543 --> 02:30:14.464]  Are you ready for Ruth?
[02:30:15.672 --> 02:30:17.013]  Yeah, I don't know what's going on.
[02:30:17.073 --> 02:30:17.653]  It's all right.
[02:30:18.153 --> 02:30:18.834]  Go ahead, Ruth.
[02:30:18.934 --> 02:30:32.340]  I just wanted, somebody mentioned the CFR a short while ago, and I just wanted to tell you that Rumsfeld just got through speaking to them on all the big TV stations.
[02:30:33.661 --> 02:30:35.181]  You know, they were reporting it.
[02:30:35.201 --> 02:30:53.266]  Yeah, they had Bill Clinton give that speech where he thanked David Rockefeller, nationally televised with CFR behind him, and they still say, the police terror files say, these groups delusionally believe in a new world order, and an imaginary group called the CFR.
[02:30:53.426 --> 02:30:54.586]  It doesn't exist.
[02:30:55.266 --> 02:30:59.667]  Well, if they were watching all the big cable networks,
[02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:04.962]  They had to see that he was speaking to the CFR just a few minutes ago.
[02:31:05.942 --> 02:31:06.742]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:31:07.362 --> 02:31:09.523]  What was he saying at the CFR, Ruth?
[02:31:09.623 --> 02:31:10.923]  I don't listen to him.
[02:31:11.023 --> 02:31:16.165]  I just had my TV on mute and read what was going on.
[02:31:16.425 --> 02:31:17.125]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:31:17.145 --> 02:31:18.966]  But I didn't hear a word he said.
[02:31:18.986 --> 02:31:19.706]  I didn't listen.
[02:31:19.746 --> 02:31:20.906]  I didn't want to listen.
[02:31:21.126 --> 02:31:29.009]  Did you hear me read this article out of the Sunday Mail and Reuters about the death camps?
[02:31:29.739 --> 02:31:30.019]  Oh yeah.
[02:31:30.039 --> 02:31:32.281]  What do you think about those death camps?
[02:31:34.322 --> 02:31:38.305]  Well, we just live in, I guess, call it horror.
[02:31:38.506 --> 02:31:39.967]  I don't know what else to call it.
[02:31:40.707 --> 02:31:43.189]  Well, I think that's a good summation of what we live in.
[02:31:43.249 --> 02:31:44.450]  I would call it horror.
[02:31:44.470 --> 02:31:47.432]  And it's horrible to see this happening.
[02:31:47.452 --> 02:31:48.733]  Anything else you'd like to add, Ruth?
[02:31:48.793 --> 02:31:55.038]  Just pray, pray that it will all get cleared up and go away and we will be back to our Constitution.
[02:31:55.939 --> 02:31:57.740]  We've got to, and we've got to relearn it.
[02:31:57.880 --> 02:31:58.600]  Thanks for the call.
[02:31:59.400 --> 02:32:00.501]  Here are those articles I mentioned.
[02:32:00.521 --> 02:32:02.102]  I'll get to some stuff I haven't gotten to.
[02:32:02.882 --> 02:32:04.062]  This is U.S.
[02:32:04.122 --> 02:32:05.303]  plans death camp.
[02:32:05.463 --> 02:32:05.803]  The U.S.
[02:32:05.843 --> 02:32:10.345]  has floated plans to turn Guantanamo Bay into a death camp with its own death row and execution chamber.
[02:32:10.365 --> 02:32:18.008]  Prisoners would be tried, convicted, and executed without leaving its boundaries, without a jury, and without a right of appeal, the Mail on Sunday newspaper reported.
[02:32:20.020 --> 02:32:27.063]  The plans were revealed by Major General Jeffrey Miller, who is in charge of the 680 suspects from 43 countries, including two Australians.
[02:32:27.783 --> 02:32:39.208]  And it adds in here that, well, you know, that the General thinks it's great, and so does our government, but they don't tell you that General Rick Baucus, again, resigned last year, refusing to carry out torture.
[02:32:40.889 --> 02:32:45.651]  So they're going to torture young people into confessions, they've even got children there, execute them, and say,
[02:32:47.680 --> 02:32:48.921]  See, we had a confession.
[02:32:49.001 --> 02:32:51.984]  Folks, this is so evil, and they're not even Taliban or Al Qaeda.
[02:32:52.965 --> 02:32:57.289]  Euro hits record high versus the dollar as our government continues to badmouth the dollar.
[02:32:57.309 --> 02:32:58.229]  This is out of Reuters.
[02:32:58.770 --> 02:33:08.999]  The Euro hit a record high against the dollar at 118.99 on Tuesday, climbing above the previous record of 118.86 set on the major trading system.
[02:33:09.700 --> 02:33:13.443]  The Euro is keeping its bullish tone from yesterday, especially after the strong
[02:33:14.419 --> 02:33:23.683]  Figures said a dealer at the major Japanese bank but London was on holiday when they released so I think the market is still trying to catch up he added.
[02:33:24.103 --> 02:33:34.527]  Data released on Monday showed the key German IFO business climate index rose 87.6 in May from April's 86.6 beating most analysts forecast.
[02:33:36.408 --> 02:33:42.811]  Meanwhile home sales are down, car sales are down, factories are shutting down, service companies are shutting down.
[02:33:43.527 --> 02:33:45.028]  Retail sales are down.
[02:33:45.848 --> 02:33:46.948]  The stock market's down.
[02:33:46.988 --> 02:33:47.989]  The dollar is plunging.
[02:33:48.809 --> 02:33:51.990]  And I heard this talk show this weekend going, greed is good.
[02:33:52.550 --> 02:33:53.711]  Money is God.
[02:33:53.751 --> 02:33:56.251]  It was on in Dallas and has an affiliate in Austin.
[02:33:57.192 --> 02:33:59.733]  I called into the guy's show and I go, what does the dropping dollar mean?
[02:33:59.953 --> 02:34:00.713]  Oh, it's not a problem.
[02:34:00.733 --> 02:34:01.313]  Don't worry about it.
[02:34:01.593 --> 02:34:02.714]  Stock market's going back up.
[02:34:02.774 --> 02:34:03.094]  Buy!
[02:34:03.174 --> 02:34:03.494]  Buy!
[02:34:03.574 --> 02:34:03.934]  Buy!
[02:34:04.014 --> 02:34:04.474]  Buy!
[02:34:06.055 --> 02:34:09.356]  Okay, the same folks that told you Enron was a great investment five years ago.
[02:34:11.115 --> 02:34:22.860]  Many dealers believe it is only a matter of time before the Euro hits the next target of $1.20, when it was worth $0.90 just a year ago, now that it has gone above the psychologically important launch day high.
[02:34:23.361 --> 02:34:29.323]  There's been some confusion over the single currency's record, with different data providers registering different all-time highs.
[02:34:29.823 --> 02:34:32.865]  Traders and electric brokers, EBS, have registered
[02:34:33.693 --> 02:34:34.433]  A peak of $119.06.
[02:34:35.473 --> 02:34:40.494]  That's what I covered last week, despite the possibility of a near-term pullback.
[02:34:40.534 --> 02:34:45.895]  Currency analysts at some major bands revised up their forecast for the year on recent weeks.
[02:34:47.616 --> 02:34:51.877]  So, and our government's saying a low dollar is good.
[02:34:52.457 --> 02:34:58.038]  And we have the Portuguese government embroiled in sex slave, child sex slave situations.
[02:34:58.078 --> 02:35:01.279]  I mean, this is who runs our lives, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:01.599 --> 02:35:03.259]  The absolute scum of the earth.
[02:35:05.049 --> 02:35:08.092]  Probe into happy pill after spat of suicides.
[02:35:09.553 --> 02:35:12.235]  Government bows to pressure over Prozac.
[02:35:13.836 --> 02:35:26.126]  A major inquiry into the launch into the safety of a widely prescribed antidepressant drugs, including Serox and Prozac, following a separate spat of suicides and reports of severe withdrawal reactions.
[02:35:26.146 --> 02:35:32.852]  The government's medical advisors have caved in to pressure to hold a fully independent assessment of the risk
[02:35:33.971 --> 02:35:39.615]  Associated with antidepressants known as SSRIs, or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors.
[02:35:40.275 --> 02:35:50.201]  By the way, when they did these studies in the early 80s of Prozac, they found a large percentage, around 14%, had suicidal tendencies.
[02:35:51.101 --> 02:36:00.127]  You see, it puts you into a dream state, so you're happily bumbling around, kind of in a mesmerized, mind-controlled state, literally.
[02:36:00.740 --> 02:36:03.668]  Then you have a bad day or a bad trip.
[02:36:04.530 --> 02:36:09.463]  These drugs are more associated with hallucinogens than they are with other type drug families.
[02:36:11.693 --> 02:36:13.294]  And some people just have a snap.
[02:36:13.374 --> 02:36:21.617]  I've talked to psychologists and people that know what's happening and they say that, you know, they've had patients who are on it and they're dancing around naked with butcher knives on top of their houses.
[02:36:21.637 --> 02:36:22.617]  They kill their kids.
[02:36:23.217 --> 02:36:26.198]  Most these women who kill their kids were on multiple drugs.
[02:36:26.859 --> 02:36:28.239]  Almost all the shooters.
[02:36:28.279 --> 02:36:31.440]  In fact, we haven't found one yet who wasn't on these drugs.
[02:36:33.061 --> 02:36:36.142]  It also makes you very open to suggestion.
[02:36:37.256 --> 02:36:40.299]  It puts you into a subconscious state, folks.
[02:36:40.319 --> 02:36:42.020]  These people are sleepwalking.
[02:36:43.541 --> 02:36:47.124]  And, of course, you get screwed up on one drug, so they put you on two or three more drugs.
[02:36:48.565 --> 02:36:49.926]  It's horrible with children.
[02:36:49.986 --> 02:36:58.793]  Recently, there have been reports of suicides among patients taking the medication, as well as users describing nightmares, tremors, and feelings of violence.
[02:36:59.685 --> 02:37:09.655]  But don't worry, the government, the Committee on Safety and Medicines has been set up to look at withdrawal reactions suffered by users who may spend months trying to come off the drugs.
[02:37:10.196 --> 02:37:11.897]  The group will listen to first-hand experience.
[02:37:11.917 --> 02:37:19.004]  Well, we've talked to doctors and scientists, and I'm not going to give you medical advice, but they say do not go off of this cold turkey.
[02:37:19.465 --> 02:37:21.327]  That's when you really get problems.
[02:37:22.188 --> 02:37:26.531]  You've got to titrate the dose downward, in reverse titration.
[02:37:27.112 --> 02:37:31.975]  You've got to get it down lower, and you've got to really phase yourself off of it over several months.
[02:37:34.096 --> 02:37:37.659]  I mean, folks, this stuff is like LSD.
[02:37:39.480 --> 02:37:48.587]  That's what it's mostly akin to, than something like Ritalin, which is an amphetamine, a speed, or a depressant like Valium.
[02:37:48.627 --> 02:37:51.469]  I mean, this stuff is just out of control.
[02:37:53.368 --> 02:37:57.991]  And, uh, there's 100 million pounds sales a year just in one of these medicines alone.
[02:37:58.031 --> 02:38:01.253]  I guess that's about 160 million in the United Kingdom.
[02:38:03.114 --> 02:38:11.399]  The news about the investigation into SSRIs will come as a blow to the pharmacological industry, which has marketed the drugs as safe and effective.
[02:38:12.740 --> 02:38:14.641]  And it goes on and on and on.
[02:38:16.570 --> 02:38:17.190]  It's amazing.
[02:38:17.731 --> 02:38:33.378]  For GSK, it comes in the wake of the humiliation of Shareholders' Rebellion, which defeated an attempt to give its chief executive, Jean-Pierre Garnier, a $15 million, billion dollar, 15 million pound payoff, were he to lose his job.
[02:38:34.475 --> 02:38:41.818]  And since last year, more than 22 million prescriptions for antidepressants were written out by British patients, most of them for SSRIs.
[02:38:41.858 --> 02:38:47.580]  These drugs work by allowing the hormone serotonin to act properly in the brain, controlling mood swings.
[02:38:47.660 --> 02:38:48.921]  Oh, to act properly?
[02:38:49.861 --> 02:38:51.121]  How about you go for a jog?
[02:38:51.161 --> 02:38:52.902]  How about you splash some cold water on your face?
[02:38:53.182 --> 02:38:55.823]  How about you get on your knees and ask God to heal you?
[02:38:56.443 --> 02:39:02.926]  Because believe me, folks, their vaccines, their drugs, are a bunch of trash.
[02:39:06.505 --> 02:39:08.567]  DNA sweep in Toronto alarms many.
[02:39:08.587 --> 02:39:11.490]  This is out of the Toronto Globe and Mail.
[02:39:12.051 --> 02:39:19.658]  These are the words Douglas Campbell, 20, used to describe his emotions after police knocked on the door of his Toronto apartment last week and asked him for a DNA sample.
[02:39:20.219 --> 02:39:25.144]  In more and more crimes, they do sweeps in whole areas of the city, demanding blood and tissue samples.
[02:39:25.896 --> 02:39:27.678]  Blood, cheeks, skin, hair samples.
[02:39:28.198 --> 02:39:36.645]  And down in Southern Louisiana, they've been doing checkpoints in whole neighborhoods, knocking on doors, threatening people with arrests if they don't give them blood or urine immediately.
[02:39:37.186 --> 02:39:38.327]  Setting that precedent.
[02:39:39.648 --> 02:39:41.670]  Labor faces ID card rebellion.
[02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:43.652]  This is some good news out of the London Guardian.
[02:39:43.672 --> 02:39:48.336]  Home office plan breaches civil liberties and is open to fraud.
[02:39:48.376 --> 02:39:50.838]  Of course, the more they give us ID numbers, the more fraud.
[02:39:52.242 --> 02:39:56.104]  David Bunker's plan for national identity cards will cause a substantial rebellion in the Commons.
[02:39:56.164 --> 02:40:12.472]  Labor members of Parliament warned last night the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are to oppose the measure as a breach of civil liberties, but the government also faces opposition from backbenchers embroiled by revolts on trial by jury, foundation hospitals, and the Iraq conflict.
[02:40:14.152 --> 02:40:16.934]  People are mad, folks, because they've gotten rid of juries.
[02:40:16.954 --> 02:40:18.694]  They're getting rid of juries, period, in England.
[02:40:18.714 --> 02:40:19.615]  They're getting rid of freedom.
[02:40:19.635 --> 02:40:21.876]  They have over three million surveillance cameras in the country.
[02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:24.411]  They're pouring in the illegals.
[02:40:24.451 --> 02:40:26.193]  There's machine gunning deaths all the time.
[02:40:26.253 --> 02:40:27.434]  Their crime rates exploded.
[02:40:28.615 --> 02:40:31.537]  They're putting satellite tracker boxes in the cars to tax people.
[02:40:32.658 --> 02:40:36.721]  The government's running around foaming at its mouth, blowing up buildings, blaming it on people.
[02:40:36.761 --> 02:40:37.622]  That's now come out.
[02:40:38.503 --> 02:40:39.804]  And it's just bedlam.
[02:40:40.685 --> 02:40:42.306]  Like it is over here in our big cities.
[02:40:43.227 --> 02:40:46.990]  They're putting farmers in jail who shoot people attacking their house for the third time.
[02:40:47.050 --> 02:40:50.693]  They arrest a woman who stabs someone who's raping her in her own home.
[02:40:51.517 --> 02:40:57.559]  This is the system when criminals control things, and at least in England they know what a national ID card is.
[02:40:57.619 --> 02:41:00.780]  Here in the US, most states have had them for 5, 6, 7, 8 years.
[02:41:02.121 --> 02:41:07.202]  Now 42 states have adopted, the final 8 are adopting face scans, thumb scans, digital photos.
[02:41:07.762 --> 02:41:12.584]  It's going in the grocery stores, going in the banks, school lunch programs, you have the thumb scan.
[02:41:13.769 --> 02:41:18.411]  Americans don't even know their driver's license is federally controlled and issued through the states.
[02:41:19.071 --> 02:41:21.352]  We've got to first know what the threat is to fight it.
[02:41:22.332 --> 02:41:23.053]  No more calls.
[02:41:23.093 --> 02:41:34.897]  I've got a news blitz on drones, on a New World Order article out of Washington Post, a little bit on the Bilderberg Group, and the final segment, keep it locked in, InfoWars.com!
[02:41:36.217 --> 02:41:42.620]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:41:43.360 --> 02:41:44.080]  That's right, folks.

[02:41:44.921 --> 02:41:47.121]  The original film was 144 minutes long.

[02:42:05.447 --> 02:42:06.507]  Population Control Program,
[02:42:06.787 --> 02:42:11.710]  The Cashless Society Control Grid, Satellite Tracking, Invitable Microchips, and much, much more.
[02:42:11.850 --> 02:42:13.751]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:44:41.124 --> 02:44:43.026]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:44:43.506 --> 02:44:46.288]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:44:47.709 --> 02:44:49.390]  I do this show live.
[02:44:49.450 --> 02:44:51.952]  We talk about real issues that affect you and your family.
[02:44:52.633 --> 02:44:55.055]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:44:55.435 --> 02:44:56.636]  until 2 p.m.
[02:44:57.116 --> 02:45:00.379]  Monday through Friday and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:45:00.739 --> 02:45:04.322]  We also simulcast on Global Shortwave so you listen on a local AM or FM.
[02:45:05.020 --> 02:45:12.665]  But you go out of town, you travel, you're a truck driver, or you're going camping, or you're going on a cruise, or you're going to see family, get yourself a shortwave radio.
[02:45:12.685 --> 02:45:18.309]  You can listen during the day at 12.172 or 9320, and then back from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 6890, or always at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:45:27.541 --> 02:45:29.502]  All right, let me hit on some of this final news.
[02:45:29.562 --> 02:45:35.183]  They could guide emergency crews, ease traffic jams, drone research, looks at traffic applications.
[02:45:35.243 --> 02:45:41.205]  Now, Senator Warner, four months ago, said they want to use it to watch the American people in every major city.
[02:45:41.665 --> 02:45:43.606]  Drones, up there 24 hours a day.
[02:45:44.046 --> 02:45:45.066]  They already have them up there.
[02:45:45.806 --> 02:45:47.487]  When they announce something, it means it's already in place.
[02:45:49.395 --> 02:45:51.237]  Then, there was backlash.
[02:45:51.397 --> 02:45:57.083]  They said, oh, it's to stop the illegals, and now all the conservatives, the neocons, are, oh, we need drones, drones, drones.
[02:45:57.604 --> 02:46:00.147]  Well, here's how they're selling it to you in the Cincinnati Enquirer.
[02:46:00.547 --> 02:46:01.748]  Hollis Plains, which the U.S.
[02:46:01.769 --> 02:46:11.259]  military has used to swoop out, snoop out Iraqi tanks and assassinate Al Qaeda terrorists, will be tested in Ohio to see whether they can battle a more down-to-earth hazard, traffic jams.
[02:46:11.889 --> 02:46:20.355]  Ohio transportation officials and university researchers believe the unmanned aerial vehicles sometimes called drones or UAVs could promise us a way to keep an eye on traffic.
[02:46:20.795 --> 02:46:22.636]  Folks, I've been in the big cities, lots of them.
[02:46:22.996 --> 02:46:24.297]  They got thousands of cameras.
[02:46:24.437 --> 02:46:27.799]  Every side road, rural roads in Texas have cameras.
[02:46:28.380 --> 02:46:30.281]  This is for you and your family, folks.
[02:46:31.782 --> 02:46:37.465]  By the way, they got drones mounted now with a system that kills your car and they want to put it on all new car standard.
[02:46:37.485 --> 02:46:41.308]  A lot are already doing it where they hit your car with a radio beam and turns your car off.
[02:46:42.182 --> 02:46:44.164]  Uh-huh, I got an article on that, by the way, here today.
[02:46:44.564 --> 02:46:48.948]  A lot of new car sellers, even if you have good credit, are going to make you take a kill switch in your car.
[02:46:49.008 --> 02:46:50.469]  They can kill by remote access.
[02:46:51.390 --> 02:46:55.674]  Ill-suited for empire is out of the Washington Post, Joseph Nye.
[02:46:56.375 --> 02:46:59.918]  The military victory in Iraq seems to have confirmed a new world order.
[02:47:00.098 --> 02:47:01.139]  That's the first line.
[02:47:01.519 --> 02:47:06.363]  Not since Rome has one nation loomed so large above the others.
[02:47:06.443 --> 02:47:08.105]  Indeed, the word empire has come out
[02:47:08.769 --> 02:47:16.494]  Of the closet, respected analysts of both left and right are beginning to refer to American Empire approvingly as a dominant narrative of the 21st century.
[02:47:17.055 --> 02:47:19.996]  So it says approvingly for the New World Order.
[02:47:21.277 --> 02:47:25.780]  But again, the FBI training manual says if you believe in the New World Order, you're an insane terrorist.
[02:47:25.880 --> 02:47:26.741]  It doesn't exist.
[02:47:27.141 --> 02:47:28.322]  As they say, they're taking over.
[02:47:29.645 --> 02:47:31.066]  There's a Bilderberg blackout.
[02:47:31.106 --> 02:47:47.718]  Christopher Boland, American Free Press, says that the mainstream media to witness the annual Bilderberg conference is to realize how the lords of the New World Order, the self-chosen elite of international finance, business, and politics, are allowed to assemble in secret and conspire with the convenience of the mainstream media.
[02:47:48.059 --> 02:47:53.262]  That's on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with a complete list of attendance.
[02:47:53.282 --> 02:47:55.004]  We have another link to another site that does that.
[02:47:56.833 --> 02:47:58.394]  Europe has a declining birth rate.
[02:47:58.494 --> 02:47:59.675]  Plunging in some areas.
[02:47:59.715 --> 02:48:01.096]  Some of the towns are half open.
[02:48:01.116 --> 02:48:05.299]  They've got articles about how they're going to put troops on the streets and MSNBC to keep you safe.
[02:48:05.699 --> 02:48:08.861]  Britain and France secure victory over the EU takeover.
[02:48:09.982 --> 02:48:17.427]  I've got another article here about how it says miss a payment and your car may die.
[02:48:17.527 --> 02:48:18.067]  Fox 39 reported.
[02:48:19.762 --> 02:48:22.183]  Imagine getting in your car, and your car won't start.
[02:48:22.203 --> 02:48:27.385]  The situation will be aggravated for most, but for hundreds of thousands of Americans, it could simply mean their car payment is overdue.
[02:48:28.045 --> 02:48:29.025]  Out of time, folks!
[02:48:29.185 --> 02:48:29.985]  Out of time!
[02:48:30.726 --> 02:48:32.646]  I didn't get to all of it, but I got to a lot of it.
[02:48:32.766 --> 02:48:34.907]  Go to InfoWars.com to read the rest.
[02:48:34.927 --> 02:48:37.408]  It was a bunch of crazy stuff we didn't get to.
[02:48:37.428 --> 02:48:38.568]  Oh, was it out of control?
[02:48:39.429 --> 02:48:43.210]  Before I end this hour, this part of the show, and come back tonight, 9 to midnight,
[02:48:43.900 --> 02:48:45.163]  Please get my videos.

[02:48:50.837 --> 02:48:52.542]  They drop down in price substantially.

[02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:02.591]  You need to have these videos.

[02:49:20.985 --> 02:49:21.586]  I'm out of time.

[02:49:22.667 --> 02:49:25.130]  Tell your friends about the show and fight the New World Order!
[02:49:26.452 --> 02:49:28.914]  I've lost 26 pounds so far with Vim and Vigor.
[02:49:29.195 --> 02:49:32.218]  Since I've been with Vim and Vigor, I've lost 30 pounds.
[02:49:32.539 --> 02:49:35.202]  Went from a size 42 to a size 38.
[02:49:35.382 --> 02:49:37.044]  People are flabbergasted when they see me.
