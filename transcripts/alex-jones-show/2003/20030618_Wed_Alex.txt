[00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:07.329]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:15.492]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.313]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:19.054]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.074 --> 00:00:20.494]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.215 --> 00:00:21.995]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.421]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:31.083]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.006 --> 00:00:44.250]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:45.991]  It's already Wednesday.
[00:00:46.787 --> 00:00:47.688]  The 18th!
[00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:49.488]  That's the 18th of June, 2003.
[00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:56.252]  We're going to have wide open phones, several guests today, and a ton of vital news and information.
[00:00:56.272 --> 00:00:57.753]  There is just stacks of it.
[00:00:59.514 --> 00:01:11.460]  Yesterday, I talked a little bit about the case in Thule, Texas, where black ski mask police, this is the Washington Post and the Associated Press I have in front of me, raided
[00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:14.843]  And arrested 40-plus people.
[00:01:15.023 --> 00:01:16.364]  No drugs were found.
[00:01:16.524 --> 00:01:19.165]  The individuals, most of them, had no criminal record.
[00:01:19.185 --> 00:01:23.026]  And they were given 20 to 90 years of peace.
[00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:30.829]  Turns out that the cop has lied about other people have been caught, framed other people, that he is an outright total criminal.
[00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:36.111]  Now, I see reports like this every single week from around the country.
[00:01:36.684 --> 00:01:46.853]  In fact, the Texas Legislature has at least said they're upset about it because now it turns out Houston, in thousands of cases, has planted false evidence with their crime lab.
[00:01:46.913 --> 00:01:49.455]  DNA and other types of evidence.
[00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:54.246]  The FBI was caught last year from Boston to L.A.
[00:01:54.326 --> 00:01:58.628]  controlling informants, controlling hitmen, running most of the narcotics.
[00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:04.290]  We have a criminal government from top to bottom out of control.
[00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:16.276]  And evil gets away with all this because the average good people are ignorant and buy the lies of the PR machine that the corrupt crime syndicate owns and controls.
[00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:19.884]  Things are getting very serious.
[00:02:19.964 --> 00:02:36.588]  By the way, Ashcroft has now said there is a Patriot Act 2 and the Justice Department has released information admitting in their own statements that the Patriot Act 1 and 2 will be used for all crime in all criminal investigations against citizens and everyone.
[00:02:37.388 --> 00:02:38.448]  No more Bill of Rights.
[00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:39.888]  No more Constitution.
[00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:43.349]  And after announcing this, Ashcroft yesterday gives a speech
[00:02:43.965 --> 00:02:44.706]  to a group of U.S.
[00:02:44.766 --> 00:03:11.244]  attorneys and says we're not taking anyone's rights people are lying and saying this is happening as his own Justice Department in the Washington Times says it will be used against citizens and for all crime so that's coming up as well Hagan wants Clinton to head NATO not just the United Nations this is the news of Norway
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.721]  Senator Graham, quiet about his role on Patriot Act.
[00:03:15.921 --> 00:03:22.643]  He claims he's trying to stop Bush and the police state and prior knowledge of 9-1-1 when he is an architect of the cover-up.
[00:03:23.123 --> 00:03:24.644]  This is how they control paradigms.
[00:03:26.084 --> 00:03:30.245]  Also, Moussaoui, Zacharias Moussaoui, seeks Congress' appearance.
[00:03:30.846 --> 00:03:37.127]  He says that the government was funding them, training them, protecting them, and allowed the attacks to take place.
[00:03:37.147 --> 00:03:38.608]  Well, it's much worse than that.
[00:03:39.827 --> 00:03:43.389]  We know the FBI paid for their cars, their homes, their credit cards.
[00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.831]  This is MSNBC, Associated Press.
[00:03:46.111 --> 00:03:47.552]  We're supposed to forget about this.
[00:03:47.572 --> 00:03:52.555]  We're supposed to forget that 9 of the 19 hijackers have been proven to still be alive.
[00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:56.278]  Also, Roe wants abortion case reversed.
[00:03:56.338 --> 00:04:02.382]  The lady who used the alias, I guess, Roe, way to protect her underage capacity.
[00:04:03.837 --> 00:04:13.451]  Now as a Christian and is against Roe Wade and is petitioning the court as she is allowed to do because she was a defendant or a plaintiff, excuse me, in an earlier case.
[00:04:14.232 --> 00:04:16.475]  Riots rock Michigan town for second night.
[00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:18.659]  State of emergency has been declared.
[00:04:19.523 --> 00:04:34.592]  Senator gun-grab ultra-socialist Hatch wants the government to be able to access all your computers without a warrant to destroy them if you download any music or video clips of any type, even legal stuff, just everything, every computer hooked into the Pentagon.
[00:04:35.252 --> 00:04:40.115]  Nothing to do with terror, now it's about downloading software, downloading music or movie clips.
[00:04:42.216 --> 00:04:47.579]  Also, a New York judge quits after terrorist remark for a woman who was there for parking tickets.
[00:04:48.892 --> 00:04:52.716]  CIA takes the charge of the frantic weapons of mass destruction search.
[00:04:52.776 --> 00:04:56.079]  Now they're sending Tenet to produce fake information.
[00:04:56.439 --> 00:05:04.187]  Turns out those so-called bioweapons mobile labs were for pumping up surveillance dirigibles.
[00:05:04.947 --> 00:05:06.509]  Look, big show, big show.
[00:05:06.549 --> 00:05:07.790]  Stay with me, you don't want to miss it.
[00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:18.804]  Enzyme Phytonutrient or EPN is a new all-in-one combination of enzymes and saccharides necessary for optimal cellular communication.
[00:05:19.444 --> 00:05:29.506]  EPN is created using a unique 14-day process resembling human digestion in which soy seeds are completely assimilated into basic nutrients and natural sweeteners.
[00:05:30.086 --> 00:05:35.807]  Enzymes are complex proteins found in digestive juices causing food to break down at an accelerated rate.
[00:05:36.347 --> 00:05:42.072]  Phytonutrients come from plants which provide important protective substances called phytochemicals.
[00:05:42.172 --> 00:05:45.174]  Saccharides are known to be important in cellular communication.
[00:05:45.735 --> 00:05:48.497]  One tablespoon before each meal is all that is needed.
[00:05:48.917 --> 00:06:01.808]  The diseases EPN may be helpful in relieving are too numerous to mention here, so call Clipscot Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for more information about this exciting new dietary supplement.
[00:06:02.328 --> 00:06:12.934]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:14.951]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:06:15.151 --> 00:06:20.894]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:06:21.154 --> 00:06:26.437]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:06:26.717 --> 00:06:30.879]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:34.821]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:06:35.082 --> 00:06:39.644]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:06:39.784 --> 00:06:46.048]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:06:46.088 --> 00:06:47.970]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:07:06.162 --> 00:07:08.224]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:07:08.934 --> 00:07:11.956]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:07:12.276 --> 00:07:17.199]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.802]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:07:22.103 --> 00:07:31.028]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:34.831]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:07:35.131 --> 00:07:40.181]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:07:40.462 --> 00:07:47.175]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:07:47.668 --> 00:07:48.328]  What about you?
[00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:54.329]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.231]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.673 --> 00:08:25.775]  All right, folks.
[00:08:26.936 --> 00:08:30.441]  It is Wednesday, and the news is just totally overwhelming.
[00:08:31.823 --> 00:08:33.486]  I was thinking about this last night.
[00:08:35.066 --> 00:08:41.554]  I read stories every month where police go into a school during a drill and fire live rounds into the walls.
[00:08:42.234 --> 00:08:48.682]  I have video of crying eight-year-old children crawling around the floor with police yelling and cussing at them in drills.
[00:08:49.855 --> 00:09:11.780]  I read news articles where they announce it's going to be a drill that day, and then at an unnamed time, the police come running into the hallways, the response teams, and any kid that was out getting a drink of water or using the bathroom is slammed to the floor, they've broken their noses, they blow cops' heads off, splatter their brains everywhere.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:18.722]  Up in Fort Worth last year, cop of the year, just last week they did it again in Florida,
[00:09:19.981 --> 00:09:21.222]  Another case in Michigan.
[00:09:22.043 --> 00:09:25.706]  There was another case last year in Michigan, but another case last week in Michigan.
[00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:27.928]  I mean, I see these reports all the time.
[00:09:29.369 --> 00:09:31.691]  And I try to get in the minds of these cops.
[00:09:31.851 --> 00:09:33.172]  How do they go in schools?
[00:09:33.332 --> 00:09:35.233]  How do they rough up kids during drills?
[00:09:35.354 --> 00:09:38.436]  How do they point machine guns at little girls while they cry?
[00:09:38.476 --> 00:09:41.499]  I have video of this in the Road to Tyranny.
[00:09:42.379 --> 00:09:45.622]  How do they shoot cops in the head and then no one gets in trouble?
[00:09:47.456 --> 00:10:09.193]  I read the reports where they raid a neighborhood, take 46 people to jail, no drugs are found, no drug paraphernalia is found, and all of the 46 get 20 to 90 years in prison for narcotics dealing, and then they find out the cop made it all up.
[00:10:10.794 --> 00:10:13.236]  Then he's done this for his whole career, basically.
[00:10:14.571 --> 00:10:24.057]  And I see the reports about the FBI running hit teams, using informants as hitmen, and collecting the checks for hits, and controlling cocaine and heroin dealing.
[00:10:24.977 --> 00:10:32.601]  And it's in the Boston newspapers, it's in the AP, but the average American still has no idea about it.
[00:10:35.243 --> 00:10:39.045]  I mean, it's not just like the police are making mistakes.
[00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:48.233]  I mean, how do they go into a neighborhood in Eugene, Oregon, raid the neighborhood,
[00:10:49.013 --> 00:10:55.094]  People with no criminal records, all because a helicopter saw somebody growing something in the backyard.
[00:10:55.134 --> 00:10:57.815]  Turns out it's a rose garden and a tomato garden.
[00:10:58.335 --> 00:11:07.037]  When no drugs are found after they've had a four-hour raid, dragging men's wives around naked in the street, 50 cops, armored vehicles driven by the National Guard.
[00:11:07.477 --> 00:11:12.658]  When they don't find any drugs, they go ahead and take the people to jail for potting soil, cooking timers,
[00:11:13.931 --> 00:11:25.285]  I mean, how does a cop, when they're at a house, and they say, it's not even an informant's word, oh, the helicopter saw what looked like marijuana growing, and so they go ahead and take you to jail for potting soil.
[00:11:25.705 --> 00:11:33.615]  How do cops load families in police cars, shackled, take them to jail, when no drugs are found?
[00:11:34.446 --> 00:11:53.714]  And then a school teacher walks out, the cops and the armored vehicles and the army are blocking the street, and the teacher says, four hours into the raid at seven in the morning, I need to go to school, I'm a teacher, and the cop in a black ski mask with his badge number covered up says, I haven't killed anybody in two weeks, and levels his gun on her.
[00:11:55.094 --> 00:11:56.175]  I mean, what happened?
[00:11:56.255 --> 00:11:58.416]  Where did they find these people?
[00:11:58.736 --> 00:11:59.196]  How did they...
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:09.744]  It's so alien to me to bear false witness and claim somebody's a drug dealer and give them 20 to 90 years in prison when there's no evidence of it.
[00:12:10.805 --> 00:12:19.569]  It's so alien to me to have loaded guns and shoot your fellow officers in raids and have blood splattering all over the children.
[00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:24.691]  Or to shoot a kid in the face in a drill at a school and then nothing happens?
[00:12:27.003 --> 00:12:28.844]  And I've got to tell you, folks, it's scary.
[00:12:29.144 --> 00:12:30.985]  It is very scary what we're facing.
[00:12:32.845 --> 00:12:45.030]  I mean, when I sit here and scan AP and Reuters and major newspapers, stuff that never makes it in the national news, though, stuff that really never even makes it in the newspaper, but makes it onto the newswire,
[00:12:46.292 --> 00:12:48.233]  And I see the bizarre crimes.
[00:12:48.273 --> 00:12:59.381]  I mean, every day there's cops who are caught red-handed on video or by witnesses pulling good-looking women over and ordering them to perform oral sex in the bushes.
[00:13:00.182 --> 00:13:01.903]  It happens all the time in Austin.
[00:13:03.044 --> 00:13:13.711]  When you find out how the government sells the drugs to the inmates in the prisons, when you find out what they're doing, the level of corruption is very frightening.
[00:13:15.186 --> 00:13:31.574]  And then you have Ashcroft now admitting there's a Patriot Act II, and the Justice Department says, over the weekend, that it releases a report saying we will use Patriot Act for all crime, in all prosecutions, across the board!
[00:13:33.395 --> 00:13:37.097]  And then you read Patriot Act II and you find out it destroys the Bill of Rights!
[00:13:37.497 --> 00:13:38.938]  What America's all about!
[00:13:41.377 --> 00:13:48.442]  Then I see how the BATF's been caught on Patriot's land, planting pipe bombs, framing people.
[00:13:50.143 --> 00:13:57.588]  The Supreme Court ruled Monday in the case of Dr. Charles T. Sell, the St.
[00:13:57.628 --> 00:14:00.691]  Louis doctor, that they can forcibly drug him.
[00:14:02.421 --> 00:14:12.206]  Now they're gonna charge him with attempted murder because some FBI informant went in and talked to him and claims that Shell, there's no evidence of this, was planning violent acts.
[00:14:12.246 --> 00:14:17.528]  You know, it's all they gotta do now is say they heard you plan something violent.
[00:14:18.328 --> 00:14:19.689]  They're liars, folks!
[00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:28.253]  All the senior people, all the senior major detectives in major cities, almost all of them from our research,
[00:14:29.076 --> 00:14:37.881]  Are liars who will frame you, who will deal drugs, who will take your property, who will kill you, and nothing will happen to them!
[00:14:38.422 --> 00:14:44.325]  They run the hitmen, they run the drugs, they run the prostitution, they're criminals!
[00:14:45.746 --> 00:14:50.709]  It's been going on since Prohibition and getting worse and worse every single year.
[00:14:50.729 --> 00:14:53.611]  And the average patrol cop isn't a bad person.
[00:14:54.682 --> 00:15:05.266]  They're just out collecting revenue, and you try to tell them about this, they'll roll their eyes and, well, yeah, we know about that, but there's nothing we can do, I'm just doing my job!
[00:15:07.667 --> 00:15:19.711]  I don't know, it just totally freaks me out to see the level of lying and systemic corruption, and to know that a trillion dollars has been looted from the Pentagon,
[00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:30.479]  And to see the Carlisle Group buying up the media and TV stations and radio stations and newspapers and to... My head is spinning.
[00:15:30.499 --> 00:15:33.521]  The amount of lies daily cannot even be chronicled.
[00:15:35.043 --> 00:15:41.548]  The amount of corruption... I just don't know what to say anymore.
[00:15:41.668 --> 00:15:41.888]  I mean...
[00:15:42.791 --> 00:15:59.507]  They now admit that from day one they knew that those two mobile trucks in Iraq that they claimed were bio-weapons labs, that the trucks were marked, that our own government has similar trucks, that it is for inflating surveillance dirigibles along the border.
[00:16:00.528 --> 00:16:05.452]  That they were used along the border to surveil the Iranians.
[00:16:06.974 --> 00:16:08.395]  What do we have on our southern border?
[00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:13.715]  Large mobile helium trucks with similar pumps and systems.
[00:16:14.956 --> 00:16:20.943]  These were hydrogen trucks because Europe and Asia do not have any stores of helium.
[00:16:21.324 --> 00:16:28.472]  They have to use the flammable hydrogen just like the Hindenburg, the Led Zeppelin.
[00:16:29.637 --> 00:16:39.824]  And on our border, for drug interdiction, they have large dirigibles with FLIR cameras and surveillance and radio listening pods.
[00:16:41.085 --> 00:16:55.795]  And it turned out that our troops, day one, knew exactly what those trucks were, and that they now, the evidence is showing, mainstream news, covered up, wouldn't let the media shoot video inside at the panels, in Arabic, that said hydrogen.
[00:16:56.656 --> 00:16:57.657]  That's all it was!
[00:16:59.332 --> 00:17:02.333]  But, they could tell you that it was something else.
[00:17:03.734 --> 00:17:05.475]  And our media won't even report on this.
[00:17:05.555 --> 00:17:10.837]  It's admitted in Europe, admitted in the BBC, admitted in the Telegraph, admitted in the Times of London, admitted in the Guardian.
[00:17:12.138 --> 00:17:15.700]  Maybe in a few news wires here, but it'll never make it in your newspaper.
[00:17:17.761 --> 00:17:21.802]  It turns out that the country of Niger never sent nuclear parts to Iraq.
[00:17:22.223 --> 00:17:25.264]  Turns out the whole document was fake, made up by this government.
[00:17:27.415 --> 00:17:29.055]  They've lied about everything, folks.
[00:17:29.095 --> 00:17:30.096]  They're liars.
[00:17:30.136 --> 00:17:31.116]  They're criminals.
[00:17:31.136 --> 00:17:33.016]  They're overthrowing America.
[00:17:35.217 --> 00:17:41.878]  And now they say that they're going to arrest citizens under the new terrorist powers for any crime?
[00:17:41.918 --> 00:17:45.218]  Well, I told you that the subsection of Patriot Act 1 said that.
[00:17:45.779 --> 00:17:50.319]  I've been screaming that for 20 months, since the passage of Patriot Act 1.
[00:17:50.839 --> 00:17:51.840]  I read the thing.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.420]  I sat up at night and read it.
[00:17:56.065 --> 00:18:03.832]  And Ashcroft says you're a traitor, you're a terrorist, you aid the terrorist if you talk about phantoms of lost liberty and charges of shredding the Constitution.
[00:18:04.732 --> 00:18:09.817]  He says there is no Patriot Act II, and then gets up two weeks ago and says there is a Patriot Act II.
[00:18:10.217 --> 00:18:13.560]  Gets up thirteen days ago and says there is a Patriot Act II.
[00:18:16.642 --> 00:18:19.785]  I mean, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:18:20.586 --> 00:18:21.346]  It's incredible.
[00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:35.494]  The general public, this is so sophisticated, the amount of lies is so sophisticated that they can tell you all the baseball or football scores, but they can't tell you what the Bill of Rights or Constitution is.
[00:18:35.874 --> 00:18:39.155]  They can't tell you what America is all about.
[00:18:40.756 --> 00:18:42.697]  They can't tell you anything.
[00:18:43.477 --> 00:18:46.298]  They have no idea and they trust this government.
[00:18:47.298 --> 00:18:48.819]  Well, the trust is slipping rapidly.
[00:18:49.418 --> 00:18:53.399]  I'm bugging people in the military, in the police agencies and intelligence.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.880]  You're not stupid.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:55.920]  You've read this stuff.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:56.921]  You know what's going on.
[00:18:57.281 --> 00:18:58.641]  You've seen it yourself.
[00:18:59.862 --> 00:19:01.942]  And this is so corrupt what we're facing.
[00:19:02.343 --> 00:19:03.963]  Stop being cowards.
[00:19:04.503 --> 00:19:06.124]  Stop going along with this.
[00:19:06.784 --> 00:19:10.065]  I know a lot of you are trying to passively not go along with this.
[00:19:10.505 --> 00:19:12.026]  I know you're just waiting to get your pensions.
[00:19:13.487 --> 00:19:20.451]  But you cannot stand idly by while the greatest country on the face of the earth is flushed down the tubes.
[00:19:23.432 --> 00:19:38.420]  I mean, when you read about 46 people arrested, given 20 to 90 years apiece, most of them had no criminal records, and it turns out that the judges and everybody knew it was a fraud, and they had this cop who would just lie about everybody.
[00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:47.452]  I mean, when you see this stuff every couple days, and it generally doesn't get national attention.
[00:19:48.713 --> 00:19:49.854]  It's scary, folks.
[00:19:50.054 --> 00:19:50.895]  It's really scary.
[00:19:50.915 --> 00:19:51.555]  But I know this.
[00:19:51.595 --> 00:19:52.656]  This is how history works.
[00:19:53.076 --> 00:19:54.117]  It's how tyranny works.
[00:19:54.757 --> 00:20:02.923]  If we don't stand up now, and say no to this corruption now, and educate ourselves now, it's going to get worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.
[00:20:04.103 --> 00:20:06.625]  I'll come back and get into all this other news from around the world.
[00:20:06.665 --> 00:20:08.026]  We'll take your calls, so stay with me.

[00:22:08.018 --> 00:22:11.921]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:22:12.121 --> 00:22:24.410]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:25.250]  The U.S.
[00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:30.874]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:22:31.274 --> 00:22:33.476]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:22:35.337 --> 00:22:36.398]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:22:36.418 --> 00:22:39.279]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:22:39.399 --> 00:22:45.402]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:22:45.842 --> 00:22:49.204]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[00:24:41.477 --> 00:24:45.177]  But I do want to talk about this system-wide corruption.
[00:24:46.898 --> 00:24:53.919]  And, you know, occasionally people get busted in the system for doing it, but it's almost always low-level people.
[00:24:54.713 --> 00:25:01.018]  Where the massive corruption is in the courts, in the executive, and in the legislative, and in the judicial.
[00:25:02.519 --> 00:25:12.967]  This is where we see the major institutionalized lying and corruption, and there's a lot of more ditto or kickbacks to go around.
[00:25:13.848 --> 00:25:20.313]  The private corporations that control the government, that people the government, are looting the government systematically.
[00:25:21.234 --> 00:25:22.595]  Take an article in the Statesman,
[00:25:23.226 --> 00:25:35.519]  Over the weekend, you know, so the governor does have misgivings about new law he just signed, but well, there was big outrage in the 80s the last time they passed this law, but the federal government has pressured them, so now they've got to do it.
[00:25:36.561 --> 00:25:39.744]  And if you take Medicare or Medicaid now, they're going to take your house.
[00:25:40.569 --> 00:25:47.172]  Now wait, it was supposedly welfare, but now you take welfare, the government's going to take your house and make you a ward of the state.
[00:25:47.232 --> 00:25:50.674]  See, everything is about the government being predatory.
[00:25:51.134 --> 00:25:54.375]  They're passing laws to take your pension funds, saying you don't own them.
[00:25:55.036 --> 00:25:57.837]  They're passing laws to take the health care away from the veterans.
[00:25:57.897 --> 00:25:58.577]  It's happening!
[00:25:59.898 --> 00:26:08.282]  Orrin Hatch says that every computer needs to be tied into the government, they need full access to your computer, and if you download anything,
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:13.221]  They're going to go ahead and destroy your computer by remote control.
[00:26:14.041 --> 00:26:16.002]  Now, think about that insane statement.
[00:26:16.602 --> 00:26:18.563]  And they're trying to pass a law to do it!
[00:26:20.003 --> 00:26:24.145]  Now, maybe folks haven't heard of the Fourth Amendment, but they've got to have a warrant to do something to you.
[00:26:24.885 --> 00:26:32.087]  To go in your house, or go in your business, or go in your daytimer booklet in the front seat of your car and read what you've written.
[00:26:33.743 --> 00:26:34.543]  But not anymore!
[00:26:34.603 --> 00:26:36.504]  They just say, oh the Pentagon's going to watch you.
[00:26:36.524 --> 00:26:38.345]  The Pentagon's going to destroy your computers.
[00:26:38.905 --> 00:26:41.006]  Section 213 of the First Patriot Act.
[00:26:41.026 --> 00:26:43.687]  We're going to break in your house, your business, your library.
[00:26:43.707 --> 00:26:45.348]  We're going to take whatever files we want.
[00:26:45.388 --> 00:26:47.589]  We can leave whatever we want in your house.
[00:26:48.929 --> 00:26:58.073]  They've got programs that I've known about for six, seven years, like the DIRT program, where they send you an email, you open it, when your computer crashes,
[00:26:59.105 --> 00:27:02.248]  You reboot it, now they've got your passwords, everything.
[00:27:02.548 --> 00:27:06.551]  They're always catching cops and people, stealing folks' bank accounts.
[00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:08.532]  The IRS has more fraud than anybody.
[00:27:08.973 --> 00:27:12.155]  Stealing checks, stealing bank accounts, looting everything.
[00:27:12.456 --> 00:27:16.118]  You try to call and complain, you can't charge them, you can't go after them criminally.
[00:27:16.399 --> 00:27:17.660]  They just laugh at you.
[00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:21.323]  Criminals have gotten smart.
[00:27:21.783 --> 00:27:23.164]  They always have throughout history.
[00:27:23.224 --> 00:27:24.205]  The smart criminal
[00:27:25.578 --> 00:27:27.920]  Doesn't put a black mask on and rob your house.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.382]  No, they go and they join the police force.
[00:27:30.422 --> 00:27:31.883]  They become a SWAT team member.
[00:27:32.523 --> 00:27:35.566]  They get given black masks and now they can do whatever they want.
[00:27:36.086 --> 00:27:38.428]  A smart criminal becomes an FBI agent.
[00:27:38.848 --> 00:27:41.090]  A smart criminal becomes a CIA officer.
[00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.752]  A smart criminal becomes a DEA agent.
[00:27:45.773 --> 00:27:47.054]  And so this has now happened.
[00:27:47.174 --> 00:27:48.595]  History's repeated itself.
[00:27:48.655 --> 00:27:50.136]  We now have tyranny upon us.
[00:27:50.877 --> 00:27:52.178]  The terrorists are carrying out
[00:27:53.146 --> 00:27:57.668]  Terror attacks composes our Savior to legitimize everything they're doing.
[00:27:59.449 --> 00:28:01.950]  And I point to the Office of Strategic Influence.
[00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:06.512]  The Pentagon tells us last year, oh, we're going to lie to you for your best interest.
[00:28:06.572 --> 00:28:07.272]  And then they do.
[00:28:07.892 --> 00:28:09.213]  Oh, we got a document.
[00:28:09.993 --> 00:28:12.114]  Africa was selling nuclear parts to Iraq.
[00:28:12.154 --> 00:28:13.595]  Turns out the whole document's fake.
[00:28:13.735 --> 00:28:16.296]  Oh, look at these bio-weapons trucks.
[00:28:17.446 --> 00:28:18.607]  Got marked all over it.
[00:28:18.987 --> 00:28:22.570]  Hydrogen pumping station for surveillance dirigibles.
[00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:24.531]  Surveillance blimps.
[00:28:25.052 --> 00:28:27.093]  Surveillance balloons.
[00:28:27.954 --> 00:28:29.715]  Over their border, which every government has.
[00:28:31.436 --> 00:28:33.338]  And they knew from day one what it was.
[00:28:33.398 --> 00:28:34.298]  They don't care.
[00:28:34.358 --> 00:28:35.519]  They're lying to you.
[00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:45.807]  And I'll be on a talk show a week from now and I'll bring this up and the host will say you're a liar and callers will say you're a liar because they'll never hear the government's own admission.
[00:28:47.975 --> 00:28:51.579]  They claimed all these weapons labs, all these weapons sites, all lies.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:57.765]  Oh, there are lots of declared sites all over the country that got bombed into the Stone Age in 91.
[00:28:58.385 --> 00:29:01.869]  They can't show you that because it's all marked US chemical weapons.
[00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:06.413]  Give them to that CIA thug Saddam Hussein.
[00:29:08.295 --> 00:29:10.016]  So, this is what we have to look forward to.
[00:29:10.036 --> 00:29:12.559]  You know, I've got this article here out of the Washington Post.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.221]  Prisoners free at last as convictions crumble.
[00:29:17.241 --> 00:29:24.405]  The case began before dawn, July 23, 1999, when mass police officers began rounding up 46 people in Thulea.
[00:29:24.945 --> 00:29:27.807]  All but six of them black in a town of fewer than 5,000 people.
[00:29:27.847 --> 00:29:31.649]  The arrests represented nearly 10% of the black population.
[00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:37.672]  In eight lightning-quick trials, juries with virtually no black members handed down blisteringly tough sentences.
[00:29:38.334 --> 00:29:57.168]  Though the sweeps turned up no drugs, though the sweeps turned up no drugs, weapons, paraphernalia, or other signs of drug dealing, that persuaded most of the other defendants to plead guilty, though many of them swore that they had never sold powdered cocaine to the undercover police officer, an itinerant Texas lawman named Tom Coleman.
[00:29:58.609 --> 00:30:01.931]  And then it goes on how they were given 20 to 90 years.
[00:30:03.172 --> 00:30:04.573]  It turns out the guy was a liar.
[00:30:04.694 --> 00:30:05.894]  We'll be right back.
[00:30:06.055 --> 00:30:06.495]  Stay with us.
[00:30:09.818 --> 00:30:16.021]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:30:16.721 --> 00:30:23.063]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most f***ing funny items you and your family use every day.

[00:30:26.725 --> 00:30:28.086]  That's homeshopgroup.com.
[00:30:54.582 --> 00:30:57.443]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:57.864 --> 00:31:18.713]  In the last couple of segments, I just went into the plethora, the giant spectrum of police framing innocent people, police running hitmen operations, police dealing drugs, CIA making up bioweapons labs, and those so-called bioweapons trucks turn out to be
[00:31:19.728 --> 00:31:26.064]  Uh, systems for filling surveillance dirigibles along the Iraqi-Iranian border.
[00:31:26.084 --> 00:31:28.911]  I've never seen such lies.
[00:31:30.868 --> 00:31:33.090]  Just corruption across the board.
[00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:44.280]  And coming up, Ashcroft of course admits Patriot Act 2 now, and now the Justice Department in an official brief says, yes, we're going to use the Patriot Act powers for all crimes, not just terrorist cases.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.381]  You will have no rights.
[00:31:45.861 --> 00:31:47.362]  We can secretly arrest you.
[00:31:47.823 --> 00:31:49.364]  Everything that was already in the U.S.
[00:31:49.404 --> 00:31:56.390]  Code and in the subsections we documented here are now admitted by the Justice Department.
[00:31:57.728 --> 00:32:03.733]  But the Justice Department knows you won't go read their statements, you won't go look at the bills, you won't go look at the U.S.
[00:32:03.773 --> 00:32:04.094]  Code.
[00:32:04.554 --> 00:32:13.262]  So Ashcroft was on TV yesterday saying again, people are aiding terrorists that say we're taking your rights, this is only for foreigners.
[00:32:13.982 --> 00:32:18.066]  When his own Justice Department admits it's for citizens, it's for everybody.
[00:32:19.992 --> 00:32:24.214]  And I want to make it clear, folks, that the government carries out the terrorism.
[00:32:24.394 --> 00:32:28.456]  The government buries pipe bombs on people's land to frame them.
[00:32:28.856 --> 00:32:29.777]  They've been caught doing it.
[00:32:30.557 --> 00:32:32.378]  The government plants the drugs.
[00:32:32.418 --> 00:32:34.279]  The government doesn't even need to plant drugs now.
[00:32:34.319 --> 00:32:36.920]  They'll arrest you for potting soil or cooking timers.
[00:32:38.401 --> 00:32:39.501]  And say it's drug-related.
[00:32:39.922 --> 00:32:42.923]  Say it's drug paraphernalia and give you 20 to 90 years in prison.
[00:32:43.163 --> 00:32:44.104]  They'll take your farm.
[00:32:44.124 --> 00:32:45.064]  They'll take your ranch.
[00:32:45.104 --> 00:32:46.004]  They'll laugh about it.
[00:32:46.245 --> 00:32:47.885]  They'll get part of the money off of it.
[00:32:47.905 --> 00:32:49.206]  The cops that actually do it.
[00:32:50.817 --> 00:32:53.039]  This is the new America, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:59.324]  And it's so important that we state the facts on the record.
[00:33:00.024 --> 00:33:04.728]  That they are carrying out the terror, that they are the violent ones, that they are the illegitimate government.
[00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:11.394]  Let's go ahead and take some calls, and then I want to get into all this other news, and believe me, there's a lot of it.
[00:33:12.094 --> 00:33:15.157]  Hagen wants Clinton to head NATO, not just the UN.
[00:33:16.818 --> 00:33:19.240]  One of Norway's most highly profiled
[00:33:20.456 --> 00:33:25.277]  And right-wing politicians, Carl Hagen is urging the nomination of former U.S.
[00:33:25.317 --> 00:33:27.538]  President Clinton as the new NATO boss.
[00:33:27.578 --> 00:33:30.298]  Of course, so-called neocons love Clinton.
[00:33:31.799 --> 00:33:33.719]  Just like Hillary loved the war on Iraq.
[00:33:34.739 --> 00:33:36.240]  She loves gun control, so does Bush.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.520]  Senator Graham, quiet about his role on Patriot Act.
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:42.101]  Claims he's all against it, he helped write it.
[00:33:42.967 --> 00:33:45.668]  See, this is how they control the paradigm by controlling both sides.
[00:33:46.108 --> 00:33:48.549]  Moussaoui seeks Congress' appearance.
[00:33:49.129 --> 00:33:53.771]  The only man charged in the connection with the September 11th attacks has asked to testify before the U.S.
[00:33:53.791 --> 00:33:54.211]  Congress.
[00:33:54.592 --> 00:34:02.855]  Becker-Reis, Moussaoui claims that he and the suspected hijackers were under the surveillance of the FBI before September 11th and that the U.S.
[00:34:02.895 --> 00:34:05.156]  intelligence agencies allowed the attacks to happen.
[00:34:07.397 --> 00:34:08.117]  Now, wait a minute.
[00:34:09.344 --> 00:34:13.949]  We know that the cards and houses and credit cards were paid for by the FBI.
[00:34:15.170 --> 00:34:17.753]  That's Associated Press, MSNBC.
[00:34:19.195 --> 00:34:20.396]  That's admitted mainstream news.
[00:34:21.177 --> 00:34:22.418]  They admit they trained them at U.S.
[00:34:22.458 --> 00:34:22.838]  bases.
[00:34:22.898 --> 00:34:29.586]  They admit that the head of Pakistani intelligence met with the heads of Congress, wired money to Mohammed Ata,
[00:34:31.633 --> 00:34:40.921]  They admit that the CIA shepherded Al-Qaeda to meetings in Malaysia and other countries, made sure that the INS gave them passes, visas back into the U.S.
[00:34:41.441 --> 00:34:43.423]  despite the fact they were on the terrorist watch list.
[00:34:44.223 --> 00:34:46.745]  Folks, they were just patsies to be seen at the scene of the crime.
[00:34:47.566 --> 00:34:49.007]  The globalists carried out the attacks.
[00:34:50.508 --> 00:34:52.570]  Roe wants abortion cases reversed.
[00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:55.252]  Riots rocked Michigan town on the second night.
[00:34:55.812 --> 00:34:59.816]  On Infowars.com, we've got a photo from a few miles away of the town as it burns.
[00:35:00.532 --> 00:35:02.193]  The people are tired of the police killing them.
[00:35:03.675 --> 00:35:07.178]  Again, Hatch takes aim at illegal downloading.
[00:35:07.598 --> 00:35:15.604]  The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said Tuesday he favors developing new technology to remotely destroy the computers of people who illegally download music from the internet.
[00:35:16.966 --> 00:35:18.907]  New York judge quits over terrorist remark.
[00:35:19.267 --> 00:35:22.850]  CIA takes charge of frantic weapons of mass destruction search.
[00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:24.712]  Don't worry, Tenet will find them.
[00:35:25.848 --> 00:35:29.911]  Iranian leaders under fire on domestic front warnings over nuke program.
[00:35:29.951 --> 00:35:31.692]  They say the war may go ahead and start.
[00:35:31.712 --> 00:35:33.793]  They're getting us ready for that.
[00:35:34.213 --> 00:35:38.015]  And the CIA now admits they have destabilized Iran with the rioting.
[00:35:39.937 --> 00:35:43.419]  UK seeks EU ultimatum on Iran's arms.
[00:35:43.479 --> 00:35:44.279]  It's all coming up.
[00:35:44.339 --> 00:35:45.980]  Right now, let's go to Kohl's.
[00:35:46.681 --> 00:35:48.702]  Let's talk to Regina in Pennsylvania.
[00:35:48.762 --> 00:35:49.903]  Regina, you're on the air.
[00:35:49.943 --> 00:35:50.303]  Go ahead.
[00:35:51.713 --> 00:35:56.174]  Hi Alex, I just wanted to kind of follow the money here a little bit if we could.
[00:35:57.375 --> 00:36:03.256]  This thing with Ashcroft, he's a real interesting character and I'm so glad you're exposing him.
[00:36:03.356 --> 00:36:07.698]  But you know, I exposed something to somebody that kind of protects him.
[00:36:08.478 --> 00:36:13.559]  And he was questioned on the idea of the Department of Justice Gay Pride event.
[00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:19.061]  That was exposed, but I guess recently it must have been truly exposed because I guess it's coming up again.
[00:36:20.123 --> 00:36:27.007]  I questioned his support of that, and I got back that it was a Clinton initiative, and it's been repealed that they'll be involved with that.
[00:36:27.067 --> 00:36:29.768]  And I thought, oh, okay, so we're going to blame it on Clinton.
[00:36:29.808 --> 00:36:30.208]  He did it.
[00:36:30.948 --> 00:36:32.189]  And here we go again.
[00:36:32.249 --> 00:36:32.889]  We'll just do that.
[00:36:32.929 --> 00:36:34.150]  So then people go back to sleep.
[00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:47.037]  Next thing I read in the Pittsburgh Post is that, this is Wednesday, June 11th, that actually Ashcroft had promised during his Senate confirmation hearings in 2001 he would continue to allow DOJ pride to hold their events.
[00:36:47.057 --> 00:36:49.638]  It's just that now, I guess, because of the heat, he's going to
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:50.880]  Make them pay for it.
[00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.441]  But, you know, it's just interesting.
[00:36:53.001 --> 00:37:04.085]  It's, you know, when you come up against, just like you said, these people are doing this to us, but their credibility is promoted by people who are just learning how to, you know, move the system to make people accept.
[00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:13.008]  Anyways, they had a question on C-SPAN this morning about, there's a congressman from another state, I'm sorry I don't know his name, but he was talking about how
[00:37:13.672 --> 00:37:24.120]  We should change the law about tolls for the highways and be able to put more tolls on the highways now to pay for the, you know, the poor roads that, you know, aren't getting fixed and things like that.
[00:37:24.721 --> 00:37:27.323]  And then also there's the gasoline tax.
[00:37:27.363 --> 00:37:29.024]  Now this is something we can do together.
[00:37:29.364 --> 00:37:41.854]  We can remind them that, you know, under the ICT, I believe it's the acronym AISCTEA, the Intercontinental Transit Funding.
[00:37:42.518 --> 00:37:50.123]  I had gone to my congressman years ago, Senator Rick Santorum, Congressman John Martha, and I'm sure there were others, about the fact that we fund Rails to Trails.
[00:37:50.183 --> 00:37:51.924]  Now what has Rails to Trails spun off?
[00:37:51.964 --> 00:38:01.470]  We have more costs in our communities, we have more lawsuits because they're going through, you know, yards and farms, we have more... You need to give folks details of what you're talking about.
[00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:04.391]  If I don't know what you're talking about, I assure you the listeners don't.
[00:38:04.671 --> 00:38:10.435]  Okay, I'm talking about that while they want us to raise our gasoline taxes in order to pay for more highways,
[00:38:11.027 --> 00:38:14.370]  I think they should be accountable to why they use the money for recreation.
[00:38:14.410 --> 00:38:21.756]  And they're not putting in more highways with the money, they're using it for gun grabbing groups, environmental land grabs, you name it.
[00:38:22.016 --> 00:38:32.264]  Right, so let them explain to us before they continue on because they love pleasing the people that want these recreational places and more environmental people.
[00:38:32.284 --> 00:38:35.146]  It has nothing to do with recreational places, it's all a big land grab.
[00:38:35.166 --> 00:38:36.167]  Thanks for the call Regina.
[00:38:37.008 --> 00:38:38.329]  Let me just make a point about this.
[00:38:40.291 --> 00:38:44.013]  If I may, we have the federal plan.
[00:38:44.153 --> 00:38:46.154]  Why listen to what congressmen have to say?
[00:38:46.174 --> 00:38:48.715]  Why listen to their lies, their propaganda?
[00:38:49.696 --> 00:39:04.183]  The National Seat Belt Initiative Plan, billions of dollars a year of funding, passed by Congress and funded each subsequent year since 98, says in Part 3 of the four-part plan, it's in my film, Police State 2000,
[00:39:06.027 --> 00:39:14.973]  That they plan to put hardened checkpoints into the roads for internal passports at the state lines and going into major cities.
[00:39:15.933 --> 00:39:19.175]  And that your cars will all be searched at these checkpoints.
[00:39:19.896 --> 00:39:30.102]  They will have National Compulsory Service, the quote, compulsory volunteers, more double speak, you have to volunteer, will be there to help search your car.
[00:39:30.902 --> 00:39:33.144]  They will have state police and federal police there.
[00:39:34.053 --> 00:39:38.315]  And the highway tolls will fund these internal checkpoints.
[00:39:39.116 --> 00:39:49.601]  Now, if you've driven on internal checkpoints in New Jersey or Kansas or Oklahoma or many other states, and I've been through these, they have highway dividers on both sides.
[00:39:49.641 --> 00:39:52.762]  You cannot exit into the small towns off the roads, which kills them.
[00:39:53.343 --> 00:40:01.907]  In the middle of the highway, they will build rest stops and McDonald's and have a checkpoint built and have the state police there.
[00:40:03.479 --> 00:40:05.241]  This is the system, okay?
[00:40:05.781 --> 00:40:15.209]  And they've said, San Francisco said, you gotta have an RFID tracker switch in your car to use the toll roads in the Bay Area.
[00:40:15.249 --> 00:40:19.693]  Now they announce, okay, to have a car, period, in the Bay Area, you gotta have this little tracker.
[00:40:20.073 --> 00:40:22.415]  We're putting in radio readers on all the roads.
[00:40:22.855 --> 00:40:24.617]  We're gonna start tracking and tracing you.
[00:40:24.657 --> 00:40:25.938]  They said that six months ago.
[00:40:26.418 --> 00:40:29.041]  Last Monday they announced, we're gonna start taxing you.
[00:40:29.321 --> 00:40:31.483]  We're gonna make the whole city a toll road.
[00:40:32.365 --> 00:40:40.494]  And you'll have to have money in an account or a digital draft system, and we're going to take money out of your account to drive on any of the roads.
[00:40:41.115 --> 00:40:49.243]  And, of course, the byproduct of that is they're going to track and trace everywhere you go and what you do off of thousands of radio readers on the sides of the roads.
[00:40:50.705 --> 00:40:52.807]  So, it's public.
[00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:57.021]  They're going to track you and tax you with RFID.
[00:40:57.521 --> 00:41:03.244]  They're going to tax and trace you using satellite tracker boxes, which they want to put in your cars.
[00:41:03.284 --> 00:41:04.985]  The hardware is already in the new cars.
[00:41:05.405 --> 00:41:09.147]  Then they just put a $25 interface into it and start taxing you.
[00:41:09.867 --> 00:41:12.709]  The gas stations are going to put in an interface for it.
[00:41:13.189 --> 00:41:19.052]  When you get gas, you're going to have to plug your car in to make sure that you haven't changed the calibrations.
[00:41:19.904 --> 00:41:26.708]  Total destruction of the Fourth Amendment, total destruction of all freedom, total tracking and tracing, total taxation.
[00:41:27.208 --> 00:41:28.349]  So good points, Regina.
[00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:33.211]  And they're using our highway funds to destroy our highways.
[00:41:33.231 --> 00:41:35.252]  You know they're tearing out highways in Texas?
[00:41:35.733 --> 00:41:36.373]  Farm roads?
[00:41:36.973 --> 00:41:38.654]  You know they're narrowing them?
[00:41:40.435 --> 00:41:42.236]  So, yes, this is what it's all about.
[00:41:43.357 --> 00:41:46.278]  To have a car is going to be an extreme luxury.
[00:41:46.899 --> 00:41:49.340]  You're going to pay massive taxes to have it.
[00:41:50.396 --> 00:41:53.178]  And they know you love your cars, they know you'll pay to have it!
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.501]  This is the new America!
[00:41:57.521 --> 00:42:02.044]  Alright, Dylan in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:42:05.627 --> 00:42:07.208]  Go ahead, caller, you're on the air.
[00:42:07.948 --> 00:42:10.630]  Thanks, Alex, appreciate your service to us today.
[00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:14.573]  I'm just trying to get information out to as many friends and family as I can.
[00:42:14.593 --> 00:42:16.434]  I've been trying to pull up the Patriot Act.
[00:42:17.715 --> 00:42:19.917]  I did want to look at the actual document.
[00:42:20.632 --> 00:42:25.336]  thomas.loc.gov H.R.
[00:42:25.356 --> 00:42:27.197]  3162 is the bill.
[00:42:28.959 --> 00:42:30.860]  You can find it in about 45 seconds.
[00:42:31.221 --> 00:42:38.947]  thomas.loc.com dot G O V Okay.
[00:42:39.127 --> 00:42:39.627]  Gov.
[00:42:39.647 --> 00:42:42.490]  And what is the number of the bill?
[00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:42.630]  H.R.
[00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:42.630]  3162.
[00:42:43.170 --> 00:42:43.230]  H.R. 3162.
[00:42:49.944 --> 00:42:51.805]  Go to Infowars.com.
[00:42:52.526 --> 00:42:54.848]  Go to the Patriot Act 2 section.
[00:42:54.868 --> 00:43:05.115]  At the bottom of my five-page analysis, I have a link to our original analysis of Patriot Act 1, subsections of the bill saved right off Thomas, Library of Congress.
[00:43:06.276 --> 00:43:15.242]  Also, you can download Patriot Act 2 in its entirety, or you can simply go to thomas.loc.gov and type in S22.
[00:43:15.562 --> 00:43:18.464]  And you'll want to read the 2003 version.
[00:43:21.929 --> 00:43:22.850]  Alright, thanks a lot, Alex.
[00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:24.531]  Does that answer your question?
[00:43:24.571 --> 00:43:25.012]  Yeah, it does.
[00:43:25.913 --> 00:43:26.493]  Thank you very much.
[00:43:26.713 --> 00:43:27.014]  You bet.
[00:43:27.054 --> 00:43:27.874]  Anything else on your mind?
[00:43:29.496 --> 00:43:31.518]  God bless you, and let's try to save this country.
[00:43:32.018 --> 00:43:33.179]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.321]  Daryl in Pennsylvania.
[00:43:35.361 --> 00:43:36.382]  Daryl, you're on the air.
[00:43:36.402 --> 00:43:36.883]  Go ahead.
[00:43:37.063 --> 00:43:47.272]  Yeah, Alex, and I hope you'll please allow me to say a few words about your videos, but first I'd like to let the other listeners know why I occasionally call in to promote your outstanding film documentaries.
[00:43:47.816 --> 00:43:52.079]  You see, I spent almost 26 years in the intelligence community, 20 of that U.S.
[00:43:52.179 --> 00:43:52.939]  Air Force and U.S.
[00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:53.280]  Army.
[00:43:53.780 --> 00:44:03.567]  And Alex, in the late 1970s, as an Army Warrant Officer, I twice went to Königstein, Germany, for what they called total immersion in intensive Russian language training.
[00:44:04.167 --> 00:44:09.270]  Russian teachers were living in various parts of Europe after having fled the Soviet police state.
[00:44:09.811 --> 00:44:15.995]  One of my teachers took a liking to me, and I got invited to some late evening get-togethers that were for teachers only,
[00:44:16.494 --> 00:44:26.421]  I was the sole exception as a student and at these gatherings the vodka would flow and at times so would the tears and sometimes these things lasted till 1 to 2 a.m.
[00:44:26.461 --> 00:44:44.613]  and the horror stories of relatives and friends of these teachers who were tortured, many tortured to death, who rotted in filthy death camps, slave labor camps, or who disappeared forever that they never knew what happened to them or who were summarily executed without a trial by jury
[00:44:45.402 --> 00:44:59.667]  My one male teacher in his 60s had a scar that ran down vertically his entire front of his face that he received from some petty police state thug when this teacher was a teenager and he didn't jump high enough when the police state thug said to jump.
[00:44:59.747 --> 00:45:08.991]  And Alex, almost everything that happened to these friends and relatives of these Russian teachers of mine I see happening today right now in our own republic.
[00:45:09.847 --> 00:45:21.970]  That's why I think it's so critical to get your great videos, and as far as I'm concerned, Alex, they're the best informational tools available into the hands of our police, military, intel personnel, teachers, and our youth.
[00:45:22.411 --> 00:45:34.834]  And I think you'll remember Solzhenitsyn's quote, Alex, of how he said, how we sat and we burned in our hearts in the camps thinking, what if, what if, what if we had resisted, what if
[00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:38.631]  And I think we're all, many Americans are going to do the same thing.
[00:45:38.911 --> 00:45:45.592]  They're going to have relatives that are going to disappear under Homeland Security and these Patriot Act bills that you're never going to hear from again.
[00:45:46.152 --> 00:45:50.393]  And many of us are going to wish that we had done more when we could.
[00:45:50.453 --> 00:45:55.134]  And I don't know, and I don't think any of us do Alex, exactly when the hammer is totally going to fall.
[00:45:55.594 --> 00:46:03.096]  But I can say this, and I think you'll agree Alex, is that every morning we wake up, we're 24 hours closer to that day.
[00:46:03.621 --> 00:46:18.825]  And so I just, I highly recommend, I beg everyone that's listening, if you haven't gotten Alex's tape, if you've got friends or relatives in the military, police, and intel agencies, please get Alex's three police tape videos, make at least ten copies of each, and hand out a free packet.
[00:46:18.905 --> 00:46:20.345]  Distribute them free to those folks.
[00:46:20.605 --> 00:46:28.967]  Well, let me just say this, Daryl, and I appreciate your eloquent comments, they are trying to institute something worse than Soviet Russia.
[00:46:30.008 --> 00:46:31.848]  They've written the laws, they've passed them.
[00:46:32.546 --> 00:46:35.648]  But there still are a lot of good people in government who are not going along with it.
[00:46:35.688 --> 00:46:37.230]  The problem is they're replacing them.
[00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:41.313]  A lot of our police force and intelligence force are former third world thugs.
[00:46:42.105 --> 00:46:47.208]  The deputy head of the Justice Department, many of these people, a lot of them are admitted former communist thugs.
[00:46:47.228 --> 00:46:50.330]  They've hired the former head of the KGB to quote, help run Homeland Security.
[00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:52.091]  That's mainstream news now.
[00:46:52.571 --> 00:46:56.233]  They're trying to set this up, but they're going to have a lot of problems.
[00:46:56.573 --> 00:47:00.735]  And by speaking out, by saying no, they can't get away with this.
[00:47:00.815 --> 00:47:03.737]  And we are in a death struggle with these people.
[00:47:03.997 --> 00:47:07.059]  And so many say, yeah, we know you're right.
[00:47:07.079 --> 00:47:07.899]  We know this is true.
[00:47:07.919 --> 00:47:09.200]  That's why we're keeping our mouths shut.
[00:47:09.818 --> 00:47:15.881]  Folks, they feed on innocent people who own property, who have businesses, who have served them.
[00:47:16.882 --> 00:47:22.365]  They seem to feed on those that don't resist them even more readily than those that go along with them.
[00:47:22.925 --> 00:47:25.086]  Lenin said that was the essence of the Red Terror.
[00:47:25.547 --> 00:47:33.151]  Alex, one of the key things your video hits, especially the latest one, please state three, total enslavement, is the torture issue and it's critical that
[00:47:33.752 --> 00:47:35.156]  That people get that word out.
[00:47:35.196 --> 00:47:40.651]  They're training a cadre of our own people in the military, as you've eloquently pointed out, down in Guantanamo Bay.
[00:47:41.483 --> 00:47:49.968]  I mean, when you start training a cadre to torture people, then it's a very slippery slope from the terrorists and the foreigners to Americans that are hauled away.
[00:47:50.108 --> 00:48:05.596]  Darryl, I'll hold you over if need be, but before 9-1-1, Firearms and Weapons of Law Enforcement, April Issues, said, had a whole article of how good torture is and maybe it should be used in all cases, and now they say the Patriot Act powers are for all crimes and will be used!
[00:48:05.936 --> 00:48:06.576]  And what are we doing?
[00:48:06.616 --> 00:48:11.718]  Going back to the days of the Inquisition, where it's okay to torture people to get, quote, information and that.
[00:48:12.098 --> 00:48:15.839]  Alex, your videos are great, and I again just beg everybody, get those videos.
[00:48:16.119 --> 00:48:24.302]  If you have friends and relatives... Darrell, stay there, because I want to hear more from you about what these former people that were in Russia were saying about the system.
[00:48:24.582 --> 00:48:28.443]  I mean, if you've read history, folks, you look at what's happening now, it's a mirror image.
[00:48:30.974 --> 00:48:33.735]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[00:48:33.935 --> 00:48:40.256]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[00:48:40.556 --> 00:48:46.438]  Would you like to make your assets vanish before the eyes of those who want to grab them, but still have them safe and sound?
[00:48:46.898 --> 00:48:50.659]  How about operating a business in a way that makes earnings tax-exempt?
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.922]  Maybe you'd like to be lawsuit-proof.
[00:48:53.182 --> 00:48:54.023]  Well, there is a way.
[00:48:54.283 --> 00:49:00.389]  And it protects your stuff from greedy lawyers, grasping relatives, and the government, especially the IRS.
[00:49:00.769 --> 00:49:11.019]  It's a unique instrument valid everywhere in the world where the right to contract is accepted, which has protected Americans for over 230 years, and is specifically guaranteed by the U.S.
[00:49:11.079 --> 00:49:11.900]  Constitution.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.801]  You don't have to go offshore to do it, either.
[00:49:14.062 --> 00:49:16.364]  This is safe, secure, and domestic.
[00:49:16.804 --> 00:49:24.532]  To get full details, and I do mean full details, get on the internet and go to either puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[00:49:24.813 --> 00:49:29.237]  That's puretrust, one word, puretrust.com or puretrust.net.
[00:49:32.259 --> 00:49:36.762]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:49:37.102 --> 00:49:41.204]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:49:41.504 --> 00:49:42.045]  We listened.
[00:49:42.345 --> 00:49:47.328]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:49:47.608 --> 00:49:48.088]  We listened.
[00:49:48.489 --> 00:49:51.510]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:49:51.951 --> 00:49:52.451]  We listened.
[00:49:52.931 --> 00:49:56.993]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:49:57.373 --> 00:49:57.873]  We listened.
[00:49:58.213 --> 00:50:03.435]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:50:03.855 --> 00:50:05.216]  Again, we listened.
[00:50:05.576 --> 00:50:12.959]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:50:13.339 --> 00:50:17.400]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium
[00:50:22.834 --> 00:50:27.116]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:50:27.316 --> 00:50:29.997]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:50:30.617 --> 00:50:34.958]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:35.138 --> 00:50:39.560]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:44.081]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:44.121 --> 00:50:45.462]  The New World Order.
[00:50:46.264 --> 00:50:47.205]  Panama!
[00:50:47.265 --> 00:50:51.467]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:50:51.547 --> 00:50:58.470]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.671]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:00.991 --> 00:51:11.396]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:11.617 --> 00:51:12.517]  If you want to understand
[00:51:12.697 --> 00:51:12.957]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:00.283 --> 00:52:01.223]  Alright, folks.
[00:52:02.784 --> 00:52:14.328]  It is the definition of tyranny when you have a corrupt government, corrupt agencies at all levels, setting up their own criminal enterprise, their own little criminal empires, and then no one can stop them.
[00:52:14.849 --> 00:52:15.789]  There's no justice.
[00:52:17.347 --> 00:52:27.093]  And for every one case you hear of cops framing people, and dealing drugs, and murdering people, and killing good cops, there are hundreds of other cases you didn't hear about.
[00:52:29.615 --> 00:52:43.284]  Going back to Darryl in Pennsylvania, Darryl, some of the trends you were talking about, what Alexander Schultz and Nietzsche described, those aren't not starting to develop, have developed here,
[00:52:44.139 --> 00:52:51.165]  And under this new Patriot Act, they just grab you, drag you away, you're never seen again, and now they're saying it's to be used for all crimes.
[00:52:51.225 --> 00:52:52.886]  I have the Washington Times article here.
[00:52:52.946 --> 00:52:54.908]  What would you say to that development?
[00:52:55.929 --> 00:53:00.252]  We could read the bill and see what they were doing and say it on air a year and a half ago.
[00:53:00.933 --> 00:53:01.593]  Two years ago.
[00:53:02.354 --> 00:53:06.037]  But now, to have them admitting it, that is scary.
[00:53:06.097 --> 00:53:07.859]  Why do you think they're having to admit it now?
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:11.922]  They're deliberately leaking some of the stuff to scare us.
[00:53:12.906 --> 00:53:19.973]  As you've pointed out many times, they just like to let you know what they're doing, leave their calling card.
[00:53:20.293 --> 00:53:29.061]  But I also think, Alex, that they're trying to move so fast right now that some of the stuff accidentally comes out, too.
[00:53:29.261 --> 00:53:33.885]  And like you've mentioned, too, that they've got some people compartmentalized to find out about this stuff.
[00:53:34.335 --> 00:53:36.477]  Good folks that do release the information.
[00:53:36.517 --> 00:53:49.087]  But if I could motivate people to buy your videos, the one thing that I could point out the most was that the tears and the hurt looks in their faces, Alex, were not so much over their loved ones and friends who had died in the camps.
[00:53:49.187 --> 00:53:50.768]  At least they knew what happened to them.
[00:53:51.188 --> 00:53:57.573]  The greatest hurt was over the fact that they knew that there were people that had been tortured, moved around from camp to camp.
[00:53:57.834 --> 00:54:02.057]  They still had people back in the Soviet Union that they were having, trying to track down these people.
[00:54:02.377 --> 00:54:03.478]  They couldn't find them.
[00:54:03.979 --> 00:54:16.330]  And I would beg all Americans to think, try to imagine the hurt of knowing that your loved ones in a slave labor camp, if they're females, I can't even describe over the air what they do to the females that are halfway decent looking.
[00:54:16.651 --> 00:54:17.692]  What if it's your sister?
[00:54:17.832 --> 00:54:18.893]  What if it's your mother?
[00:54:19.273 --> 00:54:21.555]  What if it's your aunt or something?
[00:54:22.176 --> 00:54:23.117]  What if it's your son?
[00:54:23.917 --> 00:54:29.943]  What are you going to do when under Homeland Security and the Patriot Act, they come and haul off a couple of your loved ones
[00:54:30.365 --> 00:54:31.526]  And you don't know where they are.
[00:54:31.586 --> 00:54:33.147]  They don't have to tell you where they are.
[00:54:33.187 --> 00:54:36.690]  If you even ask, you can be charged as a terrorist.
[00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:38.952]  There's one thing holding them back, a couple things.
[00:54:39.372 --> 00:54:44.756]  That we're active, that we're informed, that we still have alternative media, and that we have our Second Amendment.
[00:54:44.976 --> 00:54:50.020]  They would move in a second, if they had that, and if they had the personnel that would carry it out.
[00:54:50.341 --> 00:54:51.501]  The brainwashed personnel.
[00:54:51.541 --> 00:54:52.202]  Thanks for the call.
[00:54:52.342 --> 00:54:53.003]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:54:53.723 --> 00:54:57.106]  And since Daryl mentions it, I will tell you, yes, I produced nine films,
[00:54:58.763 --> 00:55:00.085]  Yes, they unlock minds.
[00:55:01.787 --> 00:55:02.848]  And yes, you need to get them.
[00:55:02.908 --> 00:55:05.431]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement is a new film.
[00:55:05.492 --> 00:55:09.016]  I have 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:55:10.157 --> 00:55:11.539]  My book is Descent into Tyranny.
[00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:12.741]  They're all excellent.
[00:55:12.781 --> 00:55:15.884]  Big discounts if you get three or more of any of the
[00:55:17.678 --> 00:55:18.219]  9 videos.
[00:55:18.259 --> 00:55:20.241]  They drop down to 20 from $25.95.
[00:55:20.641 --> 00:55:23.924]  Call toll free to get the films and to make copies and to start waking America up.

[00:55:24.945 --> 00:55:25.506]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:55:40.797 --> 00:55:56.950]  That's Infowars.com or net or 1-888-253-3139 or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:55:59.592 --> 00:56:02.494]  Already the biggest part of our economy is the prisons.
[00:56:03.915 --> 00:56:06.257]  And private individuals and government own them.
[00:56:06.778 --> 00:56:08.239]  You see what that's a recipe for?
[00:56:09.016 --> 00:56:10.877]  The tyranny's already here, it's not coming.
[00:56:10.917 --> 00:56:12.438]  It's what degree will you accept?
[00:56:13.699 --> 00:56:18.922]  We'll be right back with the second hour with a lot more news and Barney and Chris and others calls.
[00:56:18.982 --> 00:56:19.522]  We'll be right back.
[00:56:19.582 --> 00:56:28.027]  Hello everybody, my name is Bob Barefoot and I'm here today to introduce Bob Barefoot's Best Coral Calcium Supreme Plus.
[00:56:28.188 --> 00:56:31.530]  It has twice as much of the high-grade marine coral calcium.
[00:56:36.033 --> 00:56:39.215]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:46.810 --> 00:56:47.451]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.111 --> 00:56:49.192]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:49.893 --> 00:56:51.013]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:51.034 --> 00:56:52.495]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.215 --> 00:56:54.116]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.136 --> 00:56:58.379]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:03.103]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:07.487 --> 00:57:09.248]  Already into the second hour.
[00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:13.992]  The socialists, the neocons, their banker masters.
[00:57:15.054 --> 00:57:17.376]  I told you the Patriot Act was only for foreigners.
[00:57:17.916 --> 00:57:18.777]  We read the bill.
[00:57:19.357 --> 00:57:26.303]  It's all about citizens and any crime including misdemeanor, secret arrest, torture, execution, you name it, all now public.
[00:57:27.824 --> 00:57:40.534]  And here it is out of the Washington Times, Patriot Act 2001 cast wide net, long sought details have begun to emerge from the Justice Department on how anti-terrorism provisions of the USA Patriot Act
[00:57:43.908 --> 00:57:46.909]  were applied in non-terror investigations.
[00:57:46.949 --> 00:57:47.649]  Let me read that again.
[00:57:47.949 --> 00:58:03.233]  Long sought details have begun to emerge from the Justice Department on how anti-terrorist provisions of the USA Patriot Act were applied in non-terror investigations just as battle lines are being drawn on proposed new powers in a Patriot Act 2.
[00:58:04.713 --> 00:58:12.075]  So now it's gone from you're a traitor, you're a terrorist, you say there's a Patriot Act 2, we don't take your rights, it doesn't affect citizens,
[00:58:13.712 --> 00:58:16.894]  Yeah, there's a Patriot Act too and it does affect citizens.
[00:58:16.954 --> 00:58:19.296]  Listen to this quote by the Justice Department.
[00:58:20.837 --> 00:58:25.860]  We would use whatever tools are available to us within reason to prosecute violators of any law.
[00:58:27.361 --> 00:58:35.807]  Justice Department spokesman Brian Sierra said in the wake of his department's massive report that Congress describing how the USA Patriot Act is being implemented.
[00:58:37.395 --> 00:58:50.787]  We would use whatever tools are available to us within reason to prosecute violators of any law, Justice Department spokesman Brian Sierra said in the wake of his department's massive report to Congress describing how the USA Patriot Act is being implemented.
[00:58:53.266 --> 00:59:07.777]  The information was in response to doubts, not from outspoken civil liberties groups, but from Representative F. James Sensenbrenner, Wisconsin Republican, and the House Judiciary Committee chairman who publicly pushed for its speedy 337-79 House passage.
[00:59:08.557 --> 00:59:11.720]  And of course, this guy's a New World Order minion, just like Graham and others.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:15.823]  They're saying that they're concerned just to look good for their constituents.
[00:59:16.763 --> 00:59:17.684]  They're whitewashing.
[00:59:19.511 --> 00:59:26.413]  The information was a response to doubts, not from outspoken civil liberties groups, but from Representative James Sensenbrenner.
[00:59:27.234 --> 00:59:36.657]  We had something to do with encouraging Chairman Sensenbrenner to express our concerns, said Timothy Edgar, American Civil Liberties Union Legislative Counsel.
[00:59:38.903 --> 00:59:52.794]  Now, there they are, calmly announcing in a Justice Department brief that, yeah, we're going to use this, and they go on to say, for all misdemeanors, all crimes, we will use every power in there of secret arrest, warrantless searches, everything!
[00:59:54.695 --> 01:00:03.202]  And cops are being told in training seminars by the feds that there is no Bill of Rights, that there is no Constitution.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:05.240]  And you look at the United Kingdom.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.861]  They're getting rid of juries.
[01:00:06.901 --> 01:00:08.401]  They're reinstating double jeopardy.
[01:00:08.961 --> 01:00:10.762]  They're starting secret arrests there as well.
[01:00:10.802 --> 01:00:12.582]  They're issuing national ID cards.
[01:00:12.882 --> 01:00:15.363]  They're announcing satellite tracking and taxation.
[01:00:16.823 --> 01:00:18.063]  Same thing that's happening here.
[01:00:18.143 --> 01:00:21.924]  The UN two weeks ago announces world biometric ID cards.
[01:00:22.264 --> 01:00:28.486]  The same day the US, England, Canada, Saudi Arabia,
[01:00:30.467 --> 01:00:33.289]  Australia, New Zealand, they all announced it at the same time.
[01:00:33.329 --> 01:00:34.630]  This is world government, folks.
[01:00:34.650 --> 01:00:36.411]  This is happening right before your eyes.
[01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:42.515]  A giant cage for you and your family being built right here, right now.
[01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:48.639]  And it makes me very, very angry because I love this country.
[01:00:49.739 --> 01:00:52.601]  You say, well, Alex, if it's this tyranny, why not lay down to it?
[01:00:52.641 --> 01:00:53.662]  Folks, if we lay down
[01:00:54.562 --> 01:00:56.364]  Tyranny has a gravitational pull.
[01:00:56.444 --> 01:00:57.985]  It will increase its mass.
[01:00:58.506 --> 01:01:00.267]  It will pull more and more of us in.
[01:01:00.808 --> 01:01:03.550]  It will feed on you whether you serve them or fight them.
[01:01:04.992 --> 01:01:08.215]  Right now it is so important for us to be vocal and outspoken.
[01:01:08.655 --> 01:01:14.461]  Number one about who the terrorists are and how they carried out the terror as a pretext for all of this.
[01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:25.236]  When we get back, we'll talk to John in England, then we'll get to all the other callers, Barney, Charles, Mike, and others, and I'll get to more of the other news.
[01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:31.360]  Infowars.com, Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[01:01:33.502 --> 01:01:34.562]  Tyranny is upon us.
[01:01:34.602 --> 01:01:35.803]  Dark times are upon us.
[01:01:35.863 --> 01:01:40.767]  Will we stand to the challenge or will we submit and allow the globalists to intensify the slavery?
[01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:50.596]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:01:50.837 --> 01:01:55.200]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:02:04.427]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:02:04.627 --> 01:02:08.230]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:13.574]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:02:13.834 --> 01:02:20.599]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:02:21.059 --> 01:02:21.620]  What about you?
[01:02:22.373 --> 01:02:27.255]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.
[01:02:27.295 --> 01:02:27.715]  A $14 savings.

[01:02:41.861 --> 01:02:46.203]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:02:46.383 --> 01:02:50.805]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:02:50.965 --> 01:02:55.327]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:02:55.367 --> 01:02:56.708]  The New World Order.
[01:02:58.507 --> 01:03:02.730]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:09.716]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:03:09.856 --> 01:03:11.918]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:03:12.258 --> 01:03:22.346]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:03:22.846 --> 01:03:28.229]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you!

[01:03:41.235 --> 01:03:43.017]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:03:43.197 --> 01:03:43.817]  I mean real!
[01:03:44.017 --> 01:03:48.841]  Hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:03:49.181 --> 01:03:50.022]  Probably never, right?
[01:03:50.302 --> 01:03:53.364]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here and I want to tell you about my friend Marty.
[01:03:53.645 --> 01:03:56.066]  He's the owner and founder of the Cal Bend Soap Company.

[01:04:43.178 --> 01:04:48.802]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:48.882 --> 01:04:59.450]  Alright, let's go right back to your calls, and I want to go through these calls quickly because I do want to get into all this mountain of vital news and information.
[01:05:00.170 --> 01:05:02.772]  John in England, welcome to the Airwaves, go ahead.
[01:05:03.353 --> 01:05:03.753]  Hi Alex.
[01:05:05.367 --> 01:05:13.078]  I'm glad to see you picked up on that Massawi story, which, I mean, you know, is just another nail in the coffin for the military-industrial complex.
[01:05:13.338 --> 01:05:20.849]  I wanted to tell you, Greg Pallis' programme, BBC Newsnight, last night did a story about the deregulation of the British media, focusing on the radio.
[01:05:21.736 --> 01:05:27.082]  Um, and we had a government lackey afterwards telling us that deregulating the media is good for competition.
[01:05:27.482 --> 01:05:31.726]  First thing I think, best thing for competition with the radio market would be to give out more licenses.
[01:05:32.007 --> 01:05:38.333]  That's it, instead they restrict the licenses that are issued and then allow just a few people to own those.
[01:05:38.854 --> 01:05:42.658]  Yeah, I mean they could give, we have plenty of space left on the dial for more stations.
[01:05:43.258 --> 01:05:45.780]  And definitely AM, we've got room for plenty of stations.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:48.381]  We need stations like GCN.
[01:05:48.821 --> 01:05:57.186]  But they had an SCC Commissioner on saying, yeah, we had concerns about all this consolidation and Clear Channel, which is why we've moved to restrict ownership.
[01:05:57.246 --> 01:05:59.428]  And I thought, this isn't what I'm hearing from the state.
[01:06:00.048 --> 01:06:04.510]  So you might want to check, if you can, the Newsnight article and go through it.
[01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:05.271]  It's about 10 minutes.
[01:06:05.871 --> 01:06:10.714]  And see if you can identify this SCC Commissioner and figure out who he is and nail him for lying.
[01:06:10.994 --> 01:06:12.115]  Because it's obviously a lie.
[01:06:14.702 --> 01:06:15.603]  It's been horrible.
[01:06:15.663 --> 01:06:19.503]  They've knocked off almost all local news programming, even in big cities.
[01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:22.784]  They have fake programming where a guy in St.
[01:06:22.824 --> 01:06:27.005]  Louis does the news for Austin or a guy in Austin does the news for Portland, Oregon.
[01:06:27.565 --> 01:06:30.306]  They have fired just masses of people.
[01:06:31.066 --> 01:06:33.447]  They are shutting a bunch of stations down.
[01:06:33.947 --> 01:06:35.467]  They are restricting things.
[01:06:35.908 --> 01:06:41.609]  The FCC will grease the skids for the big three owners but harass little stations.
[01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:43.751]  It's incredible.
[01:06:45.453 --> 01:06:48.957]  And it's, again, a consolidation of the media.
[01:06:49.018 --> 01:06:50.079]  It's not free market.
[01:06:50.754 --> 01:06:51.535]  This was a U.S.
[01:06:51.695 --> 01:07:02.562]  FCC official who was saying, I mean this was last night, this was a very recent interview, and he said, oh yeah, we were concerned about all this consolidation, so we've just acted to restrict the consolidation.
[01:07:02.943 --> 01:07:04.404]  And that's not what you're telling me.
[01:07:04.684 --> 01:07:06.045]  That's not what I'm reading on the internet.
[01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:07.366]  Well, it's the complete cert.
[01:07:07.466 --> 01:07:12.970]  You can go read what the FCC, when Mr. Powell, Colin Powell's son, did.
[01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:17.753]  They took the restrictions off consolidation of radio, TV, and print.
[01:07:17.993 --> 01:07:19.514]  That's an administrative fact.
[01:07:20.655 --> 01:07:21.976]  This is what they do all the time.
[01:07:22.016 --> 01:07:27.339]  They say, there is no new world order, and then next up, the President announces a new world order.
[01:07:27.419 --> 01:07:30.301]  They say, Patriot Act 2 doesn't affect citizens.
[01:07:30.781 --> 01:07:32.362]  If you say it does, you're a terrorist.
[01:07:32.723 --> 01:07:35.344]  And then next newscast, the Patriot Act 2 is here.
[01:07:35.744 --> 01:07:37.205]  There is no tips program.
[01:07:37.305 --> 01:07:39.447]  Next newscast, we're doubling the tips program.
[01:07:40.268 --> 01:07:43.610]  Alex, over here now, we have constitutional reform by press release.
[01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:45.150]  I don't know if you've been following this.
[01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:53.374]  Yeah, they just announced no more juries, no more double jeopardies, trying you twice for the same crime.
[01:07:53.414 --> 01:07:57.376]  We're getting rid of Scotland's government with a press release.
[01:07:57.416 --> 01:07:59.837]  We're getting rid of Wales' government.
[01:08:00.713 --> 01:08:03.794]  They just publicly announced, no more state governments.
[01:08:04.054 --> 01:08:06.175]  We're taking you over just with a press release.
[01:08:06.635 --> 01:08:09.295]  The Lord Chancellor's Department has been around for 1,500 years.
[01:08:09.716 --> 01:08:12.096]  And they issued a press release saying, it's now abolished.
[01:08:12.416 --> 01:08:21.939]  But I saw the replacement, a lord, who is not elected, he's selected, he's been appointed, is now the head of what's called the Department for Constitutional Affairs.
[01:08:22.079 --> 01:08:23.459]  And that's the guy that appoints the judges.
[01:08:26.087 --> 01:08:38.230]  Yeah, but he is now the new Lord Chancellor, and I saw him sitting down and being, basically being called the new Lord Chancellor by the House of Lords at the same time that they're telling us there's no such thing as the Lord Chancellor anymore.
[01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:39.630]  I saw it on television!
[01:08:41.571 --> 01:08:46.552]  After they've made the announcement, it's, you know, you're absolutely right, I mean, Orwell was a prophet.
[01:08:48.507 --> 01:08:58.490]  Well, I've got the BBC article where they say it's great, they're going to take away all your representation in the House of Commons.
[01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:07.332]  Scotland is just, with a quiet announcement, after thousands of years of war with England, they just calmly announce, you have no sovereignty, you're now part of England.
[01:09:07.712 --> 01:09:09.213]  They announce to the Welsh,
[01:09:11.174 --> 01:09:12.816]  In Wales, it's over for you.
[01:09:12.956 --> 01:09:14.477]  You're totally controlled by us now.
[01:09:15.278 --> 01:09:17.000]  We're going to appoint everybody now.
[01:09:17.921 --> 01:09:19.903]  We're not going to have a referendum on the Euro.
[01:09:19.923 --> 01:09:21.024]  You're just going to accept it.
[01:09:21.144 --> 01:09:22.045]  Ha, ha, ha!
[01:09:22.465 --> 01:09:25.649]  There'll be no investigation of lies about weapons of mass destruction.
[01:09:25.969 --> 01:09:26.730]  Ha, ha, ha!
[01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:29.872]  Three and a half million face scanning cameras isn't enough?
[01:09:30.212 --> 01:09:31.092]  Ha ha ha!
[01:09:31.492 --> 01:09:34.314]  We're going to satellite track you and tax you to drive your car?
[01:09:34.654 --> 01:09:35.535]  Ha ha ha!
[01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:37.536]  We're going to bring in more illegal aliens?
[01:09:37.616 --> 01:09:38.436]  Ha ha ha!
[01:09:38.876 --> 01:09:44.900]  We're going to arrest anybody that defends themselves even with a steak knife of a burglar bus in your house?
[01:09:45.220 --> 01:09:46.120]  Ha ha ha!
[01:09:46.401 --> 01:09:48.762]  We're having door-to-door gun confiscation sweeps?
[01:09:49.082 --> 01:09:50.043]  Ha ha ha!
[01:09:51.383 --> 01:09:54.885]  You'll be arrested if you're caught using the pound weight and measures?
[01:09:54.985 --> 01:09:55.846]  Ha ha ha!
[01:09:56.843 --> 01:09:58.224]  Yeah, I'm rolling on the floor laughing.
[01:09:58.525 --> 01:10:00.026]  I mean, it's a great new system, isn't it?
[01:10:01.007 --> 01:10:02.268]  Same thing's happening here, sir.
[01:10:02.308 --> 01:10:04.490]  They're just erasing everything.
[01:10:04.770 --> 01:10:13.518]  Destroying America, setting up tyranny, and the average person is in a corner, sucking their thumb, drinking beer, watching the football game.
[01:10:14.139 --> 01:10:15.460]  And we've just had a false debate.
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:22.547]  One of the newspapers, a tabloid newspaper, has been pushing, because the government doesn't want to have a referendum on the new European Constitution,
[01:10:23.118 --> 01:10:29.083]  One of the newspapers had its own referendum, so to speak, where you could vote online, you could vote in stores around the country.
[01:10:29.383 --> 01:10:32.806]  But they didn't ask us, do you want a European Constitution?
[01:10:32.826 --> 01:10:36.910]  The newspapers asked us, do you want a referendum on the European Constitution?
[01:10:37.170 --> 01:10:38.091]  Another false debate.
[01:10:38.811 --> 01:10:40.873]  Yeah, and for those who don't know, this is how they do it.
[01:10:40.913 --> 01:10:46.898]  They say, okay, there is a new world order, there is a global government now.
[01:10:46.958 --> 01:10:49.220]  We said it didn't exist for decades, but yes, it's here.
[01:10:49.952 --> 01:10:52.674]  Do you want a left-wing or a right-wing world government?
[01:10:52.794 --> 01:10:58.618]  Basically, what paint job do you want on this tank that's going to run over your country's sovereignty?
[01:10:59.238 --> 01:11:00.459]  Yeah, how do we dice a carrot?
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:02.461]  Yeah, how do we dice a carrot?
[01:11:04.202 --> 01:11:06.303]  And then people go, okay, I want a liberal world government.
[01:11:06.323 --> 01:11:07.664]  I want a conservative world government.
[01:11:08.525 --> 01:11:11.027]  They don't ask, do you not want to be part of the Euro?
[01:11:12.498 --> 01:11:13.038]  Yeah, how you doing Alex?
[01:11:13.058 --> 01:11:16.599]  I suspect that the reason that the brutal so-called SWAT teams wear ski masks
[01:11:41.829 --> 01:11:45.991]  It's because they are criminals and that they are used over and over again.
[01:11:46.091 --> 01:11:53.953]  Well, they say that it's to protect their anonymity from retaliation and they cover their badge numbers now routinely.
[01:11:53.994 --> 01:11:59.275]  Police walk around Austin with their badges covered up with tape and it's all part of the new freedom, sir.
[01:11:59.295 --> 01:12:05.978]  Well, they don't want you to recognize them because they use them over and over again all around the country.
[01:12:06.598 --> 01:12:08.619]  But taken from the art of war,
[01:12:09.412 --> 01:12:19.678]  It doesn't matter whether the King has a 100,000 man army as long as the people think that he has a 100,000 man army.
[01:12:20.018 --> 01:12:21.158]  So that's what they're doing.
[01:12:21.178 --> 01:12:22.279]  They're just bluffing us.
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.621]  Well, they've got about a million police.
[01:12:26.648 --> 01:12:29.809]  And now they want to use a million people out of the army here domestically.
[01:12:29.849 --> 01:12:30.809]  So that's two million.
[01:12:31.229 --> 01:12:33.749]  Let's say they're all servants of the Dark Lord.
[01:12:34.109 --> 01:12:35.150]  They all love evil.
[01:12:35.190 --> 01:12:37.110]  They all hate America and the family.
[01:12:37.470 --> 01:12:38.970]  And want to destroy our Second Amendment.
[01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:40.710]  Which all of them don't, by the way.
[01:12:40.730 --> 01:12:41.211]  Right.
[01:12:41.231 --> 01:12:44.611]  But that's two million combatants in the Info Warb.
[01:12:46.011 --> 01:12:46.812]  Against us.
[01:12:47.692 --> 01:12:51.092]  And I guarantee you there's thirty million Americans that are fully awake.
[01:12:51.612 --> 01:12:55.013]  Probably sixty, seventy million that know there's a problem and are waking up.
[01:12:55.772 --> 01:12:57.213]  And so we've already got this thing.
[01:12:57.493 --> 01:13:16.422]  One, if we start acting like it, if we take over our city's political process, if we take over the elections process, if we start community newspapers, if we support those community newspapers, if we start community websites and access TV shows and community radio shows, but we've got to support that market.
[01:13:17.002 --> 01:13:18.563]  We've got to support those stations.
[01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:20.704]  We've got to support those talk show hosts.
[01:13:20.744 --> 01:13:22.425]  We've got to buy their products.
[01:13:24.265 --> 01:13:25.527]  Go along with that.
[01:13:25.987 --> 01:13:26.548]  Good point.
[01:13:27.128 --> 01:13:45.727]  Well, God bless you, Barney, but do you understand my whole hour-long diatribe where the police, every week I see articles where they're running the whores, they're running the coke, they're running the smack, they're running the hit teams, murder for hire, the FBI is all over the country, mainstream
[01:13:46.307 --> 01:13:48.609]  The Houston Crime Lab, thousands framed.
[01:13:49.009 --> 01:13:52.072]  FBI Crime Lab, hundreds and hundreds framed that we know of.
[01:13:52.592 --> 01:13:55.755]  Cops arresting 46, giving them 20 to 90 years.
[01:13:56.055 --> 01:13:57.356]  Turns out it was all made up.
[01:13:57.416 --> 01:13:59.078]  No drugs, no paraphernalia found.
[01:13:59.418 --> 01:14:01.239]  Just wholesale corruption.
[01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:04.962]  SWAT teams in schools on drills, blowing kids' heads off.
[01:14:05.042 --> 01:14:05.983]  Nothing happens to them.
[01:14:06.383 --> 01:14:08.085]  I mean, the level of corruption.
[01:14:08.645 --> 01:14:10.987]  CPS grabbing 2 million kids a year.
[01:14:11.448 --> 01:14:13.910]  Convicted pedophiles running the system in Florida.
[01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:15.331]  A Miami Herald.
[01:14:15.631 --> 01:14:21.556]  I mean, when you really start looking at the corruption of these people, it is un- I am blown away!
[01:14:21.576 --> 01:14:23.078]  That's right.
[01:14:23.118 --> 01:14:28.663]  Instead of the media exposing these frauds, they are promoting them.
[01:14:29.063 --> 01:14:33.066]  Well, what they do is, they'll announce the most obscene, incredible thing.
[01:14:33.967 --> 01:14:35.228]  You know, cop raped 100 women.
[01:14:37.393 --> 01:14:37.853]  Okay.
[01:14:38.754 --> 01:14:40.355]  Officer finally blows the whistle.
[01:14:40.535 --> 01:14:44.917]  And they don't tell you that the officer who blew the whistle got reassigned to the most dangerous detail.
[01:14:44.957 --> 01:14:46.478]  You know, that happens.
[01:14:46.498 --> 01:14:47.538]  That's happened right here in Austin.
[01:14:47.578 --> 01:14:48.259]  I've talked to the cops.
[01:14:48.279 --> 01:14:48.899]  It's been in the news.
[01:14:49.219 --> 01:14:50.620]  They mention that in the back of the paper.
[01:14:50.900 --> 01:14:55.523]  On the front of the paper, it's how the government loves you and how they're having a gun buyback.
[01:14:55.583 --> 01:15:00.845]  You know, they minimize the big stories and puff up the petty, mindless garbage.
[01:15:01.546 --> 01:15:05.508]  Well, that's like the same thing happens when they bust the wrong door down.
[01:15:06.306 --> 01:15:09.547]  That's a known tactic.
[01:15:09.807 --> 01:15:15.029]  We scan news wires for 5 hours a day, most days, I guess about 3-4 hours a day.
[01:15:15.950 --> 01:15:27.994]  Every day I see where cops in Utah and South Dakota and Florida and New York bust in the wrong house and about a third of the time they shoot the dog or someone in the house or the cop.
[01:15:28.726 --> 01:15:29.886]  And I've seen the statistics.
[01:15:30.266 --> 01:15:37.388]  The most dangerous thing to a cop is being hit by a car, and number two, being killed by another officer, namely SWAT teams.
[01:15:37.648 --> 01:15:40.089]  So cops, you want to whine and cry about how you're getting killed?
[01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:44.810]  You are killing your own people, and shame on you, you idiots!
[01:15:45.511 --> 01:15:57.854]  Well, the reason why they bust the wrong door down is because everybody in the neighborhood knows that something's going on in the house, and they have to respond in some fashion, so they bang down the door of the house next door.
[01:15:59.176 --> 01:16:00.136]  A lot of it is fear.
[01:16:00.176 --> 01:16:08.258]  They won't go after real drug dealers, because they probably are heavily armed, instead of doing what's smart, waiting until the crackhead drives down the street in their car, swarming them at that point.
[01:16:08.758 --> 01:16:14.020]  SWAT teams should be abolished, but for everything but haunted situations, bank robberies and the like.
[01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:16.340]  Okay, thank you.
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.260]  Absolutely.
[01:16:18.161 --> 01:16:19.601]  And now police are so cowardly.
[01:16:19.661 --> 01:16:21.561]  I mean, 50 years ago, somebody was robbing a bank.
[01:16:21.581 --> 01:16:28.583]  They'd send in some Korean War veteran, he'd climb into the window, pull out his .38, and shoot the thug in the head from behind.
[01:16:29.577 --> 01:16:32.660]  I mean, cops used to be so tough.
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.942]  And they weren't about to harass some good citizen.
[01:16:35.162 --> 01:16:37.904]  But if you were a thug, they'd knock your teeth out!
[01:16:37.944 --> 01:16:38.725]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:47.272]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and
[01:16:48.712 --> 01:16:52.557]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:16:52.857 --> 01:16:53.398]  We listened.
[01:16:53.698 --> 01:16:58.704]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:16:58.985 --> 01:16:59.465]  We listened.
[01:16:59.846 --> 01:17:02.890]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:03.831]  We listened.
[01:17:04.291 --> 01:17:08.354]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:17:08.734 --> 01:17:09.234]  We listened.
[01:17:09.574 --> 01:17:14.797]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:17:15.218 --> 01:17:16.578]  Again, we listened.
[01:17:16.939 --> 01:17:24.323]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:28.786]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at
[01:17:34.326 --> 01:17:42.749]  Are you prepared?
[01:17:42.949 --> 01:17:45.350]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:49.992]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[01:17:50.292 --> 01:17:53.753]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[01:17:53.993 --> 01:17:56.134]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[01:17:56.854 --> 01:18:00.855]  Jerry Dede from the Ark Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[01:18:01.075 --> 01:18:04.015]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[01:18:04.115 --> 01:18:11.197]  Call the Ark Institute today at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[01:18:11.417 --> 01:18:16.738]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[01:18:16.998 --> 01:18:21.999]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[01:18:22.239 --> 01:18:23.259]  Jerry can help here too.
[01:18:24.079 --> 01:18:28.740]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:32.902]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[01:18:33.022 --> 01:18:36.643]  Call the Ark Institute today, toll free 1-800-255-1912.
[01:18:36.963 --> 01:18:41.844]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com.
[01:18:42.244 --> 01:18:46.506]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:18:46.946 --> 01:18:51.407]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:18:51.867 --> 01:18:56.733]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[01:18:57.093 --> 01:18:58.895]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[01:18:58.935 --> 01:18:59.956]  can barely be read.
[01:18:59.976 --> 01:19:01.238]  It has faded that much.
[01:19:01.578 --> 01:19:05.503]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[01:19:05.743 --> 01:19:06.564]  We bring them to you by
[01:19:06.664 --> 01:19:07.104]  We're good to go!
[01:19:29.079 --> 01:19:34.326]  Call now toll-free 800-686-2237 and order the Documents of Freedom.
[01:19:34.627 --> 01:19:36.049]  Don't wait, do it today!
[01:19:36.389 --> 01:19:36.890]  The number 800-686-2237.
[01:19:43.636 --> 01:19:47.259]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[01:19:47.419 --> 01:19:51.803]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:19:52.003 --> 01:19:56.466]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[01:19:56.486 --> 01:19:59.609]  There are no moving parts, and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[01:19:59.909 --> 01:20:04.533]  It works for just pennies a day, with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[01:20:04.813 --> 01:20:08.636]  Made of the finest materials, it has a 2-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[01:20:08.936 --> 01:20:11.318]  And the Aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[01:20:11.618 --> 01:20:15.501]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[01:20:15.721 --> 01:20:20.945]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[01:20:21.145 --> 01:20:24.067]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[01:20:24.247 --> 01:20:26.108]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[01:20:26.329 --> 01:20:30.932]  For more information about the Aeronizer, call Toll Free and tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[01:20:31.152 --> 01:20:32.613]  The toll-free number to call is 877-605-9200.
[01:20:32.653 --> 01:20:32.893]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:20:32.933 --> 01:20:35.656]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:20:35.696 --> 01:20:37.357]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:54.737 --> 01:20:56.378]  Alright folks, we're back live.
[01:20:56.398 --> 01:20:58.900]  We're going to go to Charles and John and others.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:20:59.941]  I've got to get to this news.
[01:20:59.981 --> 01:21:06.945]  I'll take these two calls quick, come back and cover news, the balance of the hour, the last 27 minutes.
[01:21:08.086 --> 01:21:13.350]  But the story I was trying to tell before we hit that last break is that I have had a lot of family who are police.
[01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:16.372]  I've read a lot of history books about police.
[01:21:16.672 --> 01:21:18.073]  I've talked to a lot of older police.
[01:21:19.634 --> 01:21:20.915]  I've read old news articles.
[01:21:21.055 --> 01:21:22.436]  I mean, if somebody had a hostage
[01:21:23.183 --> 01:21:35.286]  The cops were such good shots, and this country was free, and were so fearless that they would just climb through the roof, come down through a vent, and shoot the thug with one shot in the head.
[01:21:35.386 --> 01:21:36.786]  You didn't need SWAT teams.
[01:21:37.387 --> 01:21:39.167]  You didn't have cops killing cops.
[01:21:39.947 --> 01:21:47.209]  But now you've got some washout from Special Forces who loves to kill people and watches Rambo movies all night.
[01:21:47.896 --> 01:21:49.577]  And you're asleep at 2 a.m.
[01:21:49.978 --> 01:21:54.961]  Some crackhead informant says that they saw drugs being dealt from your home.
[01:21:56.042 --> 01:22:00.826]  The SWAT team busts in your door, shoots your lab, because it got up and barked at them.
[01:22:01.086 --> 01:22:03.548]  That's standard procedure, by the way, in major departments.
[01:22:03.928 --> 01:22:05.649]  They call it dog-killing detail.
[01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:07.230]  Whoever's going point.
[01:22:08.431 --> 01:22:13.375]  And then when no drugs are found, more often than not, they go into your kitchen, they get a cooking timer.
[01:22:13.435 --> 01:22:14.175]  This is what they do.
[01:22:14.215 --> 01:22:15.016]  This is policy.
[01:22:15.862 --> 01:22:25.350]  They arrest you, put in a claim for asset forfeiture seizure of your house, tear out walls looking for drugs, potting soil, anything!
[01:22:26.592 --> 01:22:38.202]  I know of like 65-year-old insurance salesmen who have been taken to jail for having a pipe at the living room table full of bags of tobacco he bought at the drugstore, you know?
[01:22:39.562 --> 01:22:40.882]  I mean, I read these articles.
[01:22:40.942 --> 01:22:44.703]  Some old man's got a pipe and some tobacco and he goes to jail?
[01:22:44.743 --> 01:22:51.704]  I mean, how do the cops put old men in handcuffs, put them in cars, after they shoot their dog?
[01:22:52.485 --> 01:22:54.105]  I'm trying to understand this.
[01:22:55.725 --> 01:22:57.686]  What did they do to your little brains?
[01:22:59.146 --> 01:23:01.626]  Charles in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:23:02.066 --> 01:23:04.207]  Yeah, Mr. Jones, we had another
[01:23:05.327 --> 01:23:08.729]  Shooting of police on some black guy here in Pittsburgh.
[01:23:08.769 --> 01:23:13.092]  This is like over a dozen in the last, I'd say, five years.
[01:23:13.632 --> 01:23:17.014]  Anyway, this guy had some mental problems.
[01:23:17.054 --> 01:23:18.075]  He was up on the roof.
[01:23:18.315 --> 01:23:26.500]  The family, from what I understand, was begging the police, let them go in and talk to him, and they could get him talked down.
[01:23:26.520 --> 01:23:31.443]  They said, get out of the way and shut up and kill this guy.
[01:23:31.783 --> 01:23:32.764]  Well, it's worse than that.
[01:23:32.804 --> 01:23:34.925]  I see the cases where it was in one in Denver,
[01:23:35.968 --> 01:23:39.989]  Uh, where this guy was distraught with his steak knife sitting on his front lawn.
[01:23:40.729 --> 01:23:44.229]  I just walked over, shot him like 50 times with rubber bullets, and he died on the spot.
[01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.950]  I mean, you know.
[01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:51.831]  Yeah, it's, uh, a few years ago there was a, uh, article in the, uh, Wheeling Intelligencer.
[01:23:51.851 --> 01:23:55.651]  This happened down in, uh, Charleston, West Virginia.
[01:23:56.312 --> 01:24:00.812]  The top one was about a guy that was in the courthouse for a domestic violence thing.
[01:24:00.852 --> 01:24:02.713]  Anyway, he runs out of the courthouse.
[01:24:02.893 --> 01:24:04.513]  Four deputies chase after him.
[01:24:05.117 --> 01:24:07.599]  They get the guy surrounded and they shoot him in the back.
[01:24:07.959 --> 01:24:08.299]  Okay?
[01:24:08.759 --> 01:24:22.949]  Right below that is a man with a rifle, threatening I don't know who, an estate trooper, shot this guy in the hand that he had on the trigger, knocked the gun out of his hand.
[01:24:23.009 --> 01:24:25.551]  So here you have two different totally
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:37.527]  Yeah, the cops could totally blow the guy away with a gun, and I'm totally for it if he's threatening people with a rifle, but then you've got idiots shooting some unarmed guy in the back, probably having a celebration later.
[01:24:37.787 --> 01:24:47.533]  Well, I mean, it's just, uh, you had that guy on before talking about Solzhenitsyn, and I know I'm kind of bouncing around here, but do you know where he was arrested at?
[01:24:47.653 --> 01:24:49.094]  He was an artillery officer.
[01:24:49.194 --> 01:24:52.856]  He was on the Russian front fighting the Nazis.
[01:24:53.456 --> 01:24:54.277]  They came right
[01:24:54.810 --> 01:24:55.190]  I don't
[01:25:12.669 --> 01:25:16.391]  If it hasn't happened here already, it will eventually happen.
[01:25:16.691 --> 01:25:22.933]  But you know, you basically stole my thunder when you were talking about, we really still are in charge.
[01:25:22.993 --> 01:25:27.295]  If we just act like we are, these people will run for cover.
[01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:34.038]  Yeah, but know this, the government will blow more stuff up, as their own public plan says, to pose as our saviors.
[01:25:34.498 --> 01:25:36.900]  We've got to get the word out of who the terrorists are.
[01:25:37.180 --> 01:25:40.362]  Well, you're doing a heck of a job doing that, and you're absolutely right.
[01:25:40.662 --> 01:25:43.683]  We can't let this stuff just go into like they want it.
[01:25:43.723 --> 01:25:49.227]  They want to put it on the front page for like one day, and you never see it again, and now everybody's forgot about it.
[01:25:49.267 --> 01:25:51.148]  We just have to keep bringing this up.
[01:25:51.168 --> 01:25:52.729]  Let me ask you a quick question, Charles.
[01:25:53.549 --> 01:25:55.250]  Ashcroft said there wasn't a Patriot Act.
[01:25:55.290 --> 01:25:56.191]  He says that there was.
[01:25:56.211 --> 01:25:59.032]  Now he says it is for citizens for all crimes.
[01:25:59.413 --> 01:26:01.614]  Is that not chilling when they admit it?
[01:26:01.754 --> 01:26:03.095]  Well, I watched that guy on
[01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:21.974]  Well, that was a couple weeks ago, and he's a, like I said before, he's a scary guy, and he's really, he's dead serious, and I believe that he really considers himself on the side of God, that he's a Christian, and this is the right thing to do, unless he, if he's acting, this guy has missed his calling, and should have been in Hollywood.
[01:26:21.994 --> 01:26:23.755]  No, no, no, he is, no, he is acting, sir.
[01:26:23.795 --> 01:26:27.956]  I mean, Bush is a member of Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove, and says he's a Christian.
[01:26:29.256 --> 01:26:31.657]  The devil masquerades as an angel of light.
[01:26:32.691 --> 01:26:35.694]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.614 --> 01:26:39.397]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:46.422]  Looking for a quality shortwave radio without spending hundreds of dollars?
[01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:50.145]  The Sanjian 505P shortwave radio is the answer.
[01:26:50.686 --> 01:26:56.630]  Featuring continuous tuning for all shortwave frequencies, the purple black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:26:56.650 --> 01:26:56.831]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:27:08.527 --> 01:27:13.788]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:14.048 --> 01:27:22.430]  Alright, let's take one more call from John in Florida, then I'm going straight back into the news.
[01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:24.731]  John in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:27:25.431 --> 01:27:28.312]  I don't think you have John in Florida, but you do have Ron in New York.
[01:27:28.512 --> 01:27:29.752]  Okay, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:27:29.772 --> 01:27:30.232]  I'm on, Alex.
[01:27:31.052 --> 01:27:37.914]  Alex, speaking of Florida, one of the issues I wanted to start off with is that there's a DNA dragnet around the Miami area.
[01:27:38.502 --> 01:27:38.862]  Yeah, I know.
[01:27:38.882 --> 01:27:40.183]  And they had one in Louisiana.
[01:27:40.203 --> 01:27:42.464]  Now they're saying they just order you to give DNA.
[01:27:42.804 --> 01:27:43.525]  No court order.
[01:27:43.565 --> 01:27:44.665]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[01:27:44.925 --> 01:27:48.807]  The strange part about it is the ACLU was called into the issue.
[01:27:48.847 --> 01:27:53.790]  And the ACLU, in spite of what people think, the ACLU is really not there to protect civil liberties.
[01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:55.691]  They're there to lose key cases.
[01:27:55.731 --> 01:27:56.911]  They're a low opposition group.
[01:27:56.932 --> 01:27:57.052]  Right.
[01:27:57.072 --> 01:27:58.752]  They're financed by the Ford Foundation.
[01:27:58.812 --> 01:27:59.833]  We know what the agenda is.
[01:28:00.273 --> 01:28:02.114]  This is the ACLU response to that.
[01:28:02.915 --> 01:28:07.437]  They were saying that mostly it was Hispanic males that were being targeted in this dregnet, right?
[01:28:07.955 --> 01:28:13.981]  So the ACLU responds that it would be acceptable to do this if everybody was targeted in a dragnet.
[01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:21.068]  Instead of taking the position that it's unacceptable to abuse all people, their attitude is if you abuse everyone it's acceptable.
[01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:28.155]  And then they say, well the DNA samples that were submitted should be destroyed once the real criminal is apprehended.
[01:28:28.275 --> 01:28:30.838]  And I thought that was odd because the police already have
[01:28:31.553 --> 01:28:33.614]  The real criminal's DNA from the crime scenes.
[01:28:34.094 --> 01:28:40.518]  So why do you have to wait for an apprehension, which may never happen if they never catch him, in order to destroy the DNA samples of innocent people?
[01:28:40.538 --> 01:28:48.803]  Sir, Patriot Act 2 states anyone who's arrested for parking tickets, no seatbelt, will all have to give blood.
[01:28:49.743 --> 01:28:53.966]  I have the news article, and it's in Police State 3 Total Enslavement, by the way.
[01:28:53.986 --> 01:28:55.807]  I have the news article.
[01:28:56.787 --> 01:29:03.993]  Uh, out of Mesa, Arizona, where they've announced checkpoints where everyone has their blood taken to see if you're using alcohol.
[01:29:04.533 --> 01:29:13.720]  They're setting the precedent that they take from our body what they want, they put in our body what they want, they're now engaging in forced inoculations in this country.
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:18.123]  What more invasive intrusion than to go into the veins of your body to remove your blood?
[01:29:18.583 --> 01:29:23.207]  What more invasive intrusion and larger violation of Fourth Amendment than that?
[01:29:23.732 --> 01:29:24.453]  And it gets better.
[01:29:24.914 --> 01:29:29.119]  The Federal Appeals Court in the Ninth Circuit in California in a case where a guy was shot.
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:31.001]  Alright, a police officer shot a guy.
[01:29:31.702 --> 01:29:35.267]  The guy was conscious, wanted to exercise his Miranda rights to remain silent.
[01:29:35.387 --> 01:29:36.308]  He had a bullet in him.
[01:29:36.348 --> 01:29:37.610]  He was in extreme agony.
[01:29:38.211 --> 01:29:39.072]  And this is on tape.
[01:29:39.112 --> 01:29:40.754]  This was actually recorded on audio tape.
[01:29:41.741 --> 01:29:47.987]  The officer tells him that he will give him medical treatment as soon as he starts answering the officer's questions.
[01:29:48.247 --> 01:29:48.568]  Alright?
[01:29:48.928 --> 01:29:50.129]  That's torture, flat out.
[01:29:50.349 --> 01:29:52.632]  The guy tells you he wants to exercise his Miranda rights.
[01:29:52.692 --> 01:29:58.778]  You tell him you will not give him medical treatment for a bullet wound in his gut until he starts to confess to you.
[01:29:59.298 --> 01:30:05.244]  So the guy talks because the pain is so extreme, goes to that appeals court, and the appeals court makes an insane ruling like this.
[01:30:06.181 --> 01:30:10.983]  That that's okay, so long as the police don't intend to use it in evidence against you.
[01:30:11.023 --> 01:30:15.504]  Now, first off, the police wouldn't bother to ask that question unless they wanted to use it as evidence.
[01:30:15.904 --> 01:30:28.088]  And I go further and say, if an officer didn't want to use it as evidence, then you've got an officer with a real bad, sadistic streak who shouldn't be on a police department if he's torturing somebody to get information that will not be used in prosecution.
[01:30:28.686 --> 01:30:32.287]  But, you know, this is the way they pass it off, and everybody doesn't see through this.
[01:30:32.407 --> 01:30:33.748]  It's so simple, but they can't see it.
[01:30:34.088 --> 01:30:37.969]  Ron, I saw the news article on that appeals court ruling.
[01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:42.731]  So now they're saying, you're out there at the scene of an accident, whatever.
[01:30:42.791 --> 01:30:44.132]  They say, answer our questions.
[01:30:44.592 --> 01:30:47.593]  We're not going to call the ambulance for your arm that's cut off until you do.
[01:30:47.933 --> 01:30:52.655]  That is about as bad as the torture can get, and the court says, hey, that's just fine.
[01:30:52.995 --> 01:30:53.715]  That's torture.
[01:30:53.755 --> 01:30:55.296]  Plain and simple, that is torture.
[01:30:55.376 --> 01:30:55.937]  Nothing else.
[01:30:56.037 --> 01:30:58.398]  That is as much torture as anything in a gulag.
[01:30:58.438 --> 01:31:01.599]  But see how massive this is in our face, Ron?
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:03.480]  Your courts are not going to work anymore.
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.822]  They're supposed to be this check of balance and power.
[01:31:05.842 --> 01:31:06.642]  They've been subverted.
[01:31:06.782 --> 01:31:12.285]  And when you have federal appeals courts coming up with insane rulings like that, and I don't care what district they're in,
[01:31:12.927 --> 01:31:15.908]  Your courts have been subverted, they're not a check of balance and power.
[01:31:16.308 --> 01:31:23.591]  And the thing now that everybody was worried about, Mexican trucks with NAFTA coming over the American border, they're dangerous, they're unsafe, well guess what happened?
[01:31:24.631 --> 01:31:28.773]  American trucking companies have purchased the Mexican trucking companies, okay?
[01:31:29.633 --> 01:31:31.074]  But, here's the catch.
[01:31:31.658 --> 01:31:38.403]  The American trucking, even though the corporation that owns these Mexican companies now, don't have to live up to the higher American safety standards.
[01:31:38.784 --> 01:31:50.653]  So their operation in Mexico could still run on a wing and a prayer, the trucks could still be held together with spit and bubble gum and come across the American borders, only now it's an American corporation that owns these trucks that are operating that dangerously.
[01:31:51.193 --> 01:31:52.814]  When the hell does everybody wake up?
[01:31:53.155 --> 01:31:58.359]  And the drivers get 3 cents a mile, whereas our drivers got 30 cents a mile, thanks for the call.
[01:31:58.379 --> 01:31:58.759]  That's correct.
[01:31:59.375 --> 01:32:05.119]  Great points, Ron, from New York, and I guess John in Florida was hung up and you got in his place somehow.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:14.525]  Now, I'm not going to take any more calls, I want to cover news, but talking about Supreme Court rulings, there weren't a bunch of them this week.
[01:32:14.665 --> 01:32:23.451]  They said that they can forcibly drug Dr. Charles T. Sell, the doctor, for trial with antipsychotics, though those antipsychotics may cause death.
[01:32:24.011 --> 01:32:24.772]  That's the ruling.
[01:32:26.986 --> 01:32:29.346]  There just can't be a high probability they'll cause death.
[01:32:29.366 --> 01:32:35.608]  So they can now grab you, hold you for longer than the Senate's would even be, and forcibly drug you in solitary confinement.
[01:32:36.928 --> 01:32:48.310]  The Supreme Court has also ruled for campaign finance reform that Bush signed that doubles the amount of money corporations can give with no name on it, but restricts you like an interview 60 days before an election.
[01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:53.351]  There's a bunch of other Supreme Court rulings I want to go over, but I want to mention this
[01:32:56.354 --> 01:33:01.197]  This Tulia case, because it's just one of many I see all the time.
[01:33:03.418 --> 01:33:06.399]  And it says, prisoners free at last as convictions crumble.
[01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:21.968]  And it says the case began before dawn, July 23, 1999, when mass police officers began rounding up 46 people in Tulia, in Texas, about six of them, all but six of them black, in a town of fewer than 5,000 people.
[01:33:21.988 --> 01:33:23.128]  See, they make it a racial issue.
[01:33:23.148 --> 01:33:24.029]  They're doing this to everybody.
[01:33:24.614 --> 01:33:28.137]  The arrests represented nearly 10% of the black population.
[01:33:28.977 --> 01:33:41.226]  In eight lightning quick trials, juries of virtually no black members handed down blisteringly tough sentences, though the sweeps turned up no drugs, weapons, paraphernalia, or other signs of drug dealing.
[01:33:42.347 --> 01:33:48.192]  All of this on the word of Tom Coleman, who has now been caught lying in court as being charged with perjury.
[01:33:48.552 --> 01:33:50.053]  Tom Coleman is a police officer.
[01:33:51.972 --> 01:33:55.814]  And it says, one other convict from Tulia is expected to go free this month.
[01:33:55.914 --> 01:33:59.857]  Three imprisoned on charges from other jurisdictions will remain locked up for now.
[01:34:00.337 --> 01:34:02.818]  The 38 convicted, 25 served prison sentences.
[01:34:03.158 --> 01:34:04.719]  Nine have been released before Monday.
[01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:11.563]  And it goes on to say here that they knew that the people were innocent and didn't care.
[01:34:12.944 --> 01:34:15.205]  No drugs, not even paraphernalia.
[01:34:15.225 --> 01:34:18.367]  They couldn't even find a cooking timer or potting soil.
[01:34:18.988 --> 01:34:21.269]  That'll get you in prison for 20 to 90 years.
[01:34:21.309 --> 01:34:31.231]  The article says, two weeks ago Texas Governor signed a bill allowing them to be released pending an appeals court review, cutting short sentences ranging from 20 to 90 years.
[01:34:33.171 --> 01:34:35.612]  Now they do this every once in a while in states.
[01:34:36.852 --> 01:34:39.033]  They do it just to make you think they're doing something about it.
[01:34:41.413 --> 01:34:43.594]  And I assure you, my friends, they are not doing it.
[01:34:44.774 --> 01:34:47.795]  Again, another cop story, and I'll get into news I have not covered.
[01:34:49.324 --> 01:34:51.706]  This is out of the Washington Times yesterday.
[01:34:51.786 --> 01:34:54.449]  Patriot Act of 2001 casts wide net.
[01:34:55.930 --> 01:35:04.438]  Frank J. Murray and the Justice Department now admits the Patriot Act 1 and 2 will be used in all criminal trials against everyone for any crime.
[01:35:05.218 --> 01:35:10.903]  No juries, secret arrests, secret executions, no more Fourth Amendment, total immunity for police.
[01:35:11.484 --> 01:35:12.525]  This is the new America.
[01:35:13.149 --> 01:35:25.732]  Long sought details have begun to emerge from the Justice Department on how anti-terror provisions of the USA Patriot Act were applied in non-terror investigations just as battle lines are being drawn on a proposed new powers in Patriot Act 2.
[01:35:27.312 --> 01:35:38.295]  So they admit it's for citizens and it's for all crimes, or suspected crimes, no more rights, guilty until proven innocent, no juries, no nothing, and they admit Patriot Act 2 is proposed.
[01:35:38.315 --> 01:35:39.655]  Well, I told you that six months ago.
[01:35:40.683 --> 01:35:52.106]  Overall, the policy now allows evidence to be used for prosecuting common criminals even when obtained under extraordinary anti-terror powers and information sharing between intelligence agencies and the FBI.
[01:35:52.967 --> 01:36:04.510]  We would use whatever tools are available to us within reason to prosecute violators of any law, Justice Department spokesman Brian Sierra said in the wake of his department's massive report to Congress describing how the USA Patriot Act is being implemented.
[01:36:06.369 --> 01:36:16.896]  So, a government that deals drugs, that runs the hitmen, that runs the prostitution, an FBI that's been caught framing innocent people, that's been caught using informants as hitmen and drug dealers.
[01:36:18.597 --> 01:36:28.104]  Again, I know three FBI agents in Austin, because I'm friends of their children or neighbors, and they all live in $500,000 to $1,000,000 houses.
[01:36:28.504 --> 01:36:31.526]  They all belong to the finest yacht clubs and country clubs.
[01:36:32.552 --> 01:36:35.053]  They all drive brand new Cadillacs and Mercedes.
[01:36:35.453 --> 01:36:37.334]  They're a bunch of drug dealing trash.
[01:36:39.435 --> 01:36:40.455]  And I am sick of them.
[01:36:41.456 --> 01:36:42.596]  And I am tired of them.
[01:36:43.236 --> 01:36:46.038]  And I am tired of them getting up on TV and saying torture is good.
[01:36:46.238 --> 01:36:47.358]  And they're going to torture us.
[01:36:47.598 --> 01:36:50.359]  And that the Bill of Rights is bad, as we have them on tape saying.
[01:36:50.739 --> 01:36:53.541]  That is by it's definition, sedition!
[01:36:55.882 --> 01:36:59.243]  I have FEMA on tape saying Christians founding fathers.
[01:36:59.790 --> 01:37:00.490]  Gun owners!
[01:37:00.890 --> 01:37:02.731]  Those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[01:37:02.771 --> 01:37:04.051]  Constitution are terrorists!
[01:37:04.431 --> 01:37:13.534]  And I have police at checkpoints taking a housewife to jail because she had a pocket Constitution in her car, and they have a debate on video over whether or not it is legal.
[01:37:14.974 --> 01:37:18.235]  Think of the Orwellian bizarreness of that!
[01:37:19.915 --> 01:37:25.377]  And by the way, that's in the Road to Tyranny, and I want everybody to order the film and to make a hundred copies.
[01:37:25.417 --> 01:37:26.137]  This is how you do it.
[01:37:26.986 --> 01:37:28.086]  You buy bulk videotape.
[01:37:28.106 --> 01:37:29.267]  You buy a second VCR.
[01:37:29.587 --> 01:37:31.428]  When you go to work in the morning, you start a tape.
[01:37:32.288 --> 01:37:35.049]  When you go to sleep at night, at midnight, you start another tape.
[01:37:35.389 --> 01:37:37.410]  And you hand out the two videos every day.
[01:37:38.711 --> 01:37:40.051]  That's what you do!
[01:37:40.972 --> 01:37:42.192]  And you gotta do it now!
[01:37:42.272 --> 01:37:54.597]  If we don't expose the systematic institutionalization of pure corruption, the exact pattern, the exact terms we've seen before being set up, it is over, folks!
[01:37:56.898 --> 01:37:58.319]  And you think the tyranny is bad now?
[01:37:58.359 --> 01:38:04.684]  They're setting up an infrastructure for snatch and grabs, disappearance, textbook maximum tyranny.
[01:38:06.406 --> 01:38:08.547]  And I want to remind you, I have the AP article here.
[01:38:08.587 --> 01:38:10.449]  It's from InfoWars.com.
[01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:14.332]  New Army Chief helped plan final assault at Waco.
[01:38:16.113 --> 01:38:22.158]  Rumsfeld chooses retired former Special Operations Commander to be next Chief of Staff of the Army.
[01:38:23.070 --> 01:38:24.531]  AP in a highly unusual move.
[01:38:24.571 --> 01:38:31.374]  Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has selected a retired four-star general to become the next Army Chief of Staff, senior defense official said Tuesday.
[01:38:31.894 --> 01:38:42.139]  Peter J. Shoemaker, Special Forces officer from Vietnam, head of Combat Applications Group Fort Bragg, and who ran the Waco raid.
[01:38:42.159 --> 01:38:47.081]  The Day 51 torching of the building and the children
[01:38:47.968 --> 01:38:49.929]  Is now to be the new Army Chief of Staff.
[01:38:50.009 --> 01:38:54.690]  And this has got the military mad because he was, he was retired, he wasn't in the line of ascension.
[01:38:55.451 --> 01:39:00.712]  He's not qualified, but he will order Delta Force N to take out American citizens.
[01:39:00.752 --> 01:39:02.133]  So, he's in, folks.
[01:39:04.354 --> 01:39:05.914]  Here's another one from the Associated Press.
[01:39:05.974 --> 01:39:06.194]  U.S.
[01:39:06.234 --> 01:39:08.435]  Colonel unaware of Al-Qaeda arrest.
[01:39:09.702 --> 01:39:10.902]  The commander of the brigade that the U.S.
[01:39:10.922 --> 01:39:18.304]  Central Command said captured 74 suspected Al-Qaeda sympathizers said Monday that he had no knowledge of any such arrests and turns out it was totally made up.
[01:39:20.745 --> 01:39:21.965]  Got a bunch of other articles here.
[01:39:22.165 --> 01:39:23.625]  This is out of the London Observer.
[01:39:23.765 --> 01:39:27.726]  Iraq Mobile Labs, nothing to do with germ warfare report fines.
[01:39:27.746 --> 01:39:29.647]  This is an official government report.
[01:39:29.667 --> 01:39:30.827]  You'll never hear about it in our news.
[01:39:32.279 --> 01:39:47.723]  An official British investigation into two trailers found in Northern Iraq concluded they were not mobile germ warfare labs, as was claimed by Tony Blair and President George Bush, but were for the production of hydrogen to fill artillery balloons, as the Iraqis had continued to insist.
[01:39:48.603 --> 01:39:49.983]  Never heard that in our news, did you?
[01:39:50.303 --> 01:39:57.445]  It was marked they were hydrogen tanks to fill standard surveillance dirigibles for directing artillery in combat.
[01:39:59.315 --> 01:40:00.856]  Our government has them on the southern border.
[01:40:01.496 --> 01:40:08.060]  Every government has these as a standard tool, an artillery balloon, first used in the Civil War in this country.
[01:40:10.121 --> 01:40:12.382]  We use helium because we have helium stores here.
[01:40:12.762 --> 01:40:13.543]  They use hydrogen.
[01:40:13.563 --> 01:40:15.023]  That's what they have over there.
[01:40:15.644 --> 01:40:21.527]  And it was marked, and they knew it, and our troops knew from day one what that was and didn't care.
[01:40:24.128 --> 01:40:25.449]  So, that's your new America.
[01:40:26.889 --> 01:40:29.451]  High Court okays forcible medication for defendants.
[01:40:29.511 --> 01:40:30.432]  Washington Times.
[01:40:30.452 --> 01:40:37.138]  The Supreme Court yesterday ruled 6 of 3 that inmates charged with non-violent crimes would be forcibly medicated to make them fit for trial.
[01:40:37.718 --> 01:40:41.681]  The decision was 1 of 3 upholding the constitutionality of anti-crime practices.
[01:40:43.043 --> 01:40:52.931]  They rule they can grab you, forcibly drug you, even before charges for as long as it takes and all that has to happen is a judge or prosecutor request it, you disappear and are drugged for life.
[01:40:54.907 --> 01:40:55.868]  That's New America.
[01:40:55.988 --> 01:41:02.193]  And it happened to Charles T. Sell, an army officer, a dentist who was involved in Waco and said they were involved in murdering the people.
[01:41:02.734 --> 01:41:09.179]  He was grabbed, charged with Medicaid-Medicare fraud, held for six years, five and a half in solitary confinement.
[01:41:12.341 --> 01:41:15.984]  And NBC calls him crazy because he thinks the government's behind 9-1-1.
[01:41:16.665 --> 01:41:19.507]  He's crazy, he's drugged, total Soviet model.
[01:41:20.888 --> 01:41:23.831]  Court rules, September 11th, arrest names can remain secret.
[01:41:24.801 --> 01:41:25.201]  The U.S.
[01:41:25.241 --> 01:41:30.445]  government can keep secret the names of hundreds of people arrested and detained for September 11, 2001 hijacked planes.
[01:41:31.366 --> 01:41:33.288]  A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday.
[01:41:33.848 --> 01:41:42.995]  A three-judge panel dealt a setback to more than 20 civil liberties and other groups that invoked the Freedom of Information Act, a law that allows the disclosure of certain government needs to challenge the secret arrest.
[01:41:44.476 --> 01:41:48.539]  And it says they can arrest citizens whoever they wish, whenever they wish, and never release the names.
[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:52.883]  Secret execution death chambers are being built according to the Associated Press.
[01:41:54.309 --> 01:41:56.631]  North Korea blockade could lead to war.
[01:41:56.751 --> 01:41:59.393]  The globalists have tried to escalate war with a psychotic demon.
[01:41:59.413 --> 01:42:02.695]  They gave nuclear weapons, nuclear reactors.
[01:42:04.536 --> 01:42:06.657]  They are now telling them that they're going to invade North Korea.
[01:42:07.198 --> 01:42:11.821]  Kim Jong Il is running around like a psychotic goblin, threatening to nuke everybody and to invade South Korea.
[01:42:11.841 --> 01:42:20.727]  And the globalists love it because if they get us into a major war, it'll be a good smoke screen for police state crackdowns here as you wave desecrated plastic American flags.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.861]  And, of course, the traitor, Rumsfeld, armed with the reactors.
[01:42:27.202 --> 01:42:36.206]  Again, the Texas Southwest section of Dallas Morning News reports that the Houston Crime Lab, in thousands of cases, falsified evidence and framed people.
[01:42:36.986 --> 01:42:41.528]  But the federal court and state courts have ruled that people will stay in prison despite the falsification of evidence.
[01:42:42.589 --> 01:42:45.670]  You heard about the earlier ruling in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in California.
[01:42:46.050 --> 01:42:46.730]  I have that here.
[01:42:47.451 --> 01:42:50.092]  Where they are allowed to torture you before giving you medical attention.
[01:42:50.172 --> 01:42:50.812]  In car wrecks,
[01:42:51.677 --> 01:43:02.404]  In shooting scenes, anything, they will pull out cameras, audio recording systems, they will start recording, denying you health care as you die with bullet wounds or chopped off limbs until you answer their questions.
[01:43:03.065 --> 01:43:03.965]  And answer them properly.
[01:43:04.686 --> 01:43:06.147]  Federal court rule, this is good.
[01:43:06.427 --> 01:43:07.127]  All part of freedom.
[01:43:07.508 --> 01:43:08.008]  Continuing.
[01:43:09.291 --> 01:43:12.774]  Again, police officer's gun goes off during a drill inside Manatee High School.
[01:43:12.914 --> 01:43:14.756]  No charges, nothing will happen, just a drill.
[01:43:15.136 --> 01:43:17.157]  Similar accidents have ended in tragedy in the past.
[01:43:17.197 --> 01:43:22.482]  Two years ago in Arlington, Texas, an officer shot and killed another officer during a tactical training scenario at a junior high school.
[01:43:23.222 --> 01:43:24.723]  Brains splattered all over the children.
[01:43:24.763 --> 01:43:26.024]  This is out of Bay News 9.
[01:43:26.365 --> 01:43:27.465]  Nothing was done to the officer.
[01:43:27.766 --> 01:43:30.908]  Bathing your children in cops' brains and nothing happens.
[01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:33.550]  It gets worse, folks.
[01:43:34.511 --> 01:43:36.973]  The news gets a lot worse, a lot quicker.
[01:43:39.299 --> 01:43:41.740]  MI6 told ministers Iraq was no threat.
[01:43:42.440 --> 01:43:47.883]  Ananova, former cabinet ministers Robin Cook and Claire Short said they were both told.
[01:43:48.083 --> 01:43:53.465]  MI6, the run up to the war with Iraq, said obviously weapons of mass destruction did not pose any immediate threat.
[01:43:54.465 --> 01:43:58.367]  And it goes on that the weapons were pre-1991 weapon strengths.
[01:43:58.487 --> 01:43:59.107]  Of course they were.
[01:43:59.727 --> 01:44:03.349]  Stone Age weapons, third world country, bombed into a rotten core.
[01:44:04.210 --> 01:44:06.851]  And no one seems to care, and now the slaughter is complete.
[01:44:06.871 --> 01:44:18.355]  They're machine-gunning people at protests, doing house-to-house confiscations of guns, taking thousands every couple days to re-education centers where they admit they have giant movie screens blaring propaganda.
[01:44:18.775 --> 01:44:19.675]  People are tortured.
[01:44:19.735 --> 01:44:20.516]  They're beat to death.
[01:44:20.576 --> 01:44:21.276]  It's all admitted.
[01:44:21.556 --> 01:44:22.276]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:44:22.376 --> 01:44:22.856]  It's freedom.
[01:44:23.957 --> 01:44:26.078]  Roe sues to overturn Roe v. Wade decision.
[01:44:26.098 --> 01:44:27.218]  I'll tell you about that when we get back.
[01:44:29.246 --> 01:44:34.467]  I'll also get into inmates released from Guantanamo tell tales of despair.
[01:44:36.088 --> 01:44:38.948]  Bush says he's ready to invade Iran.
[01:44:38.968 --> 01:44:43.509]  MMR, 1,500 families to sue the government for brain damaging their children.
[01:44:44.650 --> 01:44:50.491]  The government announces that forced inoculations will begin in the country now that 90 plus percent of the citizens refuse to take the shot.
[01:44:51.151 --> 01:44:53.612]  Bill Clinton is the new head of NATO within the UN.
[01:44:53.632 --> 01:44:54.612]  Mainstream news.
[01:44:55.469 --> 01:44:56.349]  It's all coming up.
[01:44:56.369 --> 01:44:58.170]  Just absolute information overload.
[01:44:58.531 --> 01:44:59.951]  And then your calls in the third hour.
[01:44:59.971 --> 01:45:02.213]  I'm Alex Jones, Infowars.com.

[01:47:08.672 --> 01:47:10.053]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:47:10.233 --> 01:47:12.455]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:47:12.596 --> 01:47:14.698]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:47:14.958 --> 01:47:19.863]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:47:20.223 --> 01:47:24.266]  The Road of Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:47:24.506 --> 01:47:26.288]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:47:26.368 --> 01:47:37.016]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:47:37.176 --> 01:47:39.058]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:48:04.448 --> 01:48:09.570]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:48:10.271 --> 01:48:12.632]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:48:13.713 --> 01:48:19.296]  I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day and back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:48:19.316 --> 01:48:22.678]  The rebroadcast of the daytime show from 1 a.m.
[01:48:22.718 --> 01:48:23.358]  to 4 a.m.
[01:48:23.398 --> 01:48:26.540]  so it's nine hours a day of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:48:27.921 --> 01:48:32.163]  I do have some special announcements coming up in the middle of the next hour so I hope you'll stay with us for that.
[01:48:33.283 --> 01:48:44.869]  Got a warning to all the listeners and I want to expose some more of the globalist master plan of operations from my detailed understanding from my years of study and analysis of the enemy.
[01:48:46.210 --> 01:48:58.816]  Of the enemy combatants, the outside force overthrowing our republic, brainwashing our police, institutionalizing massive systematic corruption and control of allied crime syndicates under their control.
[01:49:02.119 --> 01:49:12.866]  But some of the other news I want to get to is Roe Sues to overturn Roe v. Wade and Clinton to be the head of NATO and then perhaps even simultaneously the head of the UN.
[01:49:14.787 --> 01:49:16.889]  Also, Senator Graham has criticized the Patriot Act.
[01:49:16.929 --> 01:49:18.370]  Of course, I've been telling you he wrote it.
[01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:19.771]  Well, here he is involved in it.
[01:49:19.791 --> 01:49:21.692]  This is how they control the opposition.
[01:49:23.253 --> 01:49:24.113]  It's all coming up.
[01:49:24.133 --> 01:49:26.415]  But before I do that, I need your support.
[01:49:26.675 --> 01:49:27.796]  My staff needs your support.
[01:49:27.816 --> 01:49:30.778]  What we do here to put out more films and better information
[01:49:31.641 --> 01:49:32.441]  We need your support.
[01:49:32.501 --> 01:49:34.542]  And the way you do that is by getting my videos.
[01:49:34.662 --> 01:49:35.622]  I've made nine of them.
[01:49:35.642 --> 01:49:36.722]  They're the best that are out there.
[01:49:36.742 --> 01:49:38.562]  You've heard the listeners rant and rave about them.
[01:49:39.802 --> 01:49:42.563]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement is now out.
[01:49:42.583 --> 01:49:43.583]  2 hours 40 minutes.
[01:49:43.663 --> 01:49:50.304]  Covers Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, concentration camps, foreign troops, all mainstream news.
[01:49:51.225 --> 01:49:54.845]  We get into dozens of examples of government-sponsored terrorism around the world.
[01:49:56.105 --> 01:49:59.066]  Other examples we don't cover in The Road to Tyranny or Masters of Terror.
[01:49:59.827 --> 01:50:00.927]  It's an amazing new film.
[01:50:00.947 --> 01:50:04.888]  It covers forced inoculations, gun control, all of it.
[01:50:05.788 --> 01:50:06.708]  It's $25.95.
[01:50:06.869 --> 01:50:08.809]  Order three or more of any of my nine videos.
[01:50:08.829 --> 01:50:09.849]  They drop down to $20.
[01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:11.770]  Don't wait!
[01:50:11.890 --> 01:50:12.990]  Get the films today.
[01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:15.210]  Get my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[01:50:15.570 --> 01:50:18.091]  230 pages jam-packed with info about 9-1-1.

[01:50:20.571 --> 01:50:20.912]  It's only $12.
[01:50:22.512 --> 01:50:23.352]  Get the videos.
[01:50:23.512 --> 01:50:24.312]  Make the copies.

[01:50:37.802 --> 01:50:38.562]  Make the copies.
[01:50:39.042 --> 01:50:39.603]  Stand up.
[01:50:39.643 --> 01:50:41.223]  There's more of us than there are of them.
[01:50:41.243 --> 01:50:48.767]  This evil is perpetrated because good people buy the lies and the propaganda and aid these criminals.
[01:50:49.608 --> 01:50:50.929]  And that's what gives them their strength.
[01:50:50.969 --> 01:50:59.894]  We've got to expose the illegitimate nature of the military-industrial complex and the enemy combatants that are overthrowing our Republic and carrying out terror.
[01:51:00.635 --> 01:51:04.937]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139
[01:51:12.148 --> 01:51:24.199]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001, South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:51:25.781 --> 01:51:26.682]  Please take action.
[01:51:28.043 --> 01:51:30.865]  Roe sues to overturn Roe v. Wade decision.
[01:51:30.905 --> 01:51:37.872]  Now, this is a story of how you can always come back from ignorance, come back from the deception, and join humanity and decency.
[01:51:39.156 --> 01:51:43.199]  Winner of landmark 73 abortion case challenges ruling, wants justice done.
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:52.267]  A woman known as Roe, the landmark Supreme Court case that struck down all state laws restricting abortion, is filing a motion in federal court today to overturn the 73 decision.
[01:51:52.667 --> 01:52:04.437]  The Roe v. Wade ruling should be set aside because of changes in the law and new research that make the prior decision no longer just, said Alan E. Parker Jr., lead attorney for the San Antonio, Texas-based Justice Foundation.
[01:52:04.877 --> 01:52:05.838]  And we've had him on before.
[01:52:07.139 --> 01:52:15.670]  Parker's representing the former Jane Roe, Norma McCorvey, who has the right to petition the reopening of the case because she was party to the original litigation.
[01:52:16.190 --> 01:52:24.321]  McCorvey announced in 95 she'd become a Christian and has a pro-life ministry called No Roe More, or Roe No More.
[01:52:25.698 --> 01:52:30.919]  I long for the day that justice will be done and the burden from all of these deaths will be removed from my shoulders.
[01:52:30.979 --> 01:52:35.540]  McCorvey said in a statement, I want to do everything in my power to help women and their children.
[01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:39.941]  The issue is justice for women, justice for the unborn, and justice for what is right.
[01:52:39.961 --> 01:52:45.182]  McCorvey will ask for a reversal of the judgment today at the Dallas Federal Court.
[01:52:46.242 --> 01:52:51.303]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with your calls, a guest, and key information in the third hour.
[01:52:51.323 --> 01:52:51.743]  Stay with us.
[01:52:53.772 --> 01:52:59.055]  Most people realize that everyday life can be pretty unpredictable at times, but that doesn't mean your business has to be.
[01:52:59.275 --> 01:53:04.479]  A quick call to GTI Technologies is all it takes to put your business far ahead of the competition.
[01:53:08.541 --> 01:53:11.683]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.253 --> 01:53:19.893]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.554 --> 01:53:21.635]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.335 --> 01:53:23.516]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.096 --> 01:53:24.917]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.677 --> 01:53:26.558]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.578 --> 01:53:31.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.420 --> 01:53:35.543]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:39.205 --> 01:53:39.966]  All right, folks.
[01:53:40.066 --> 01:53:43.628]  We're already in the third and final hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:53:45.737 --> 01:53:48.517]  Coming up, I'm going to get into some of the news we have not covered yet.
[01:53:49.378 --> 01:53:52.158]  Inmates released from Guantanamo tell tales of despair.
[01:53:53.838 --> 01:53:54.278]  Oh, yes.
[01:53:55.179 --> 01:53:57.739]  Supreme Court limits forced medication of some for trial.
[01:53:57.759 --> 01:54:03.600]  You read this article, then you read the ruling, it says that they can force drug you for trial, anyone.
[01:54:04.540 --> 01:54:07.661]  So, again, that's the doublespeak in the news.
[01:54:07.781 --> 01:54:10.121]  Oh, the Supreme Court's doing something good, giving you your liberty.
[01:54:10.621 --> 01:54:15.162]  Then you read the actual ruling, it destroys liberty.
[01:54:16.750 --> 01:54:18.678]  Hagan wants Clinton to head NATO.
[01:54:18.819 --> 01:54:21.269]  A so-called conservative wants Clinton to head NATO.
[01:54:22.136 --> 01:54:24.158]  And there's also calls for him to head the UN.
[01:54:24.198 --> 01:54:25.459]  Looks like that's a done deal.
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:28.662]  Senator Graham quiet about his role on Patriot Act.
[01:54:28.722 --> 01:54:28.862]  St.
[01:54:28.902 --> 01:54:29.903]  Petersburg Times.
[01:54:30.604 --> 01:54:33.166]  Senator Bob Graham campaigned in Iowa last weekend.
[01:54:33.626 --> 01:54:37.029]  At least two Democratic activists complained that the USA Patriot Act threatened civil liberties.
[01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:38.731]  They asked what he planned to do about it.
[01:54:38.971 --> 01:54:44.816]  The Florida Senator replied that he was unhappy with Attorney General John Ashcroft's implementation of the anti-terrorism law.
[01:54:45.337 --> 01:54:47.639]  Graham neglected to mention an important fact.
[01:54:47.759 --> 01:54:48.680]  He co-wrote it!
[01:54:49.580 --> 01:54:52.002]  Controversial law puts Graham in a difficult spot.
[01:54:52.042 --> 01:54:52.942]  I'll get into that more.
[01:54:53.703 --> 01:54:56.325]  Zacharias Moussaoui seeks Congress appearance.
[01:54:56.905 --> 01:55:01.908]  The only man charged in connection with the September 11th attacks has asked to testify before the U.S.
[01:55:01.948 --> 01:55:02.349]  Congress.
[01:55:02.369 --> 01:55:09.073]  Zacharias Moussaoui claims that he and the suspected hijackers were under surveillance by the FBI before September 11th and the U.S.
[01:55:09.113 --> 01:55:11.515]  intelligence agencies allowed the attacks to happen.
[01:55:12.293 --> 01:55:15.134]  This was the latest in a series of handwritten motions by Mr. and Ms.
[01:55:15.174 --> 01:55:17.714]  Sauey to the judge overseeing the case.
[01:55:18.294 --> 01:55:19.695]  Yeah, the government ran the attacks.
[01:55:19.735 --> 01:55:21.595]  There were no one on board those aircraft, folks.
[01:55:23.135 --> 01:55:25.036]  So, uh, that's coming up.
[01:55:25.096 --> 01:55:25.856]  Also, riots.
[01:55:26.036 --> 01:55:26.736]  Rock, Michigan.
[01:55:26.756 --> 01:55:28.236]  The National Guard's been called out.
[01:55:28.877 --> 01:55:30.477]  So they go into a third night this evening.
[01:55:30.517 --> 01:55:36.358]  Senator Hatch takes aim at illegal downloading, which basically could be any downloading of anything.
[01:55:36.898 --> 01:55:40.539]  They want the government tied into every computer to shut it down and destroy your computer.
[01:55:41.451 --> 01:55:42.512]  Actually says that.
[01:55:42.792 --> 01:55:43.472]  That's coming up.
[01:55:43.532 --> 01:55:45.333]  New York judge quits over terrorist remark.
[01:55:45.813 --> 01:55:47.373]  A woman there about parking tickets.
[01:55:47.394 --> 01:55:48.294]  She said, you're a Muslim.
[01:55:48.314 --> 01:55:48.994]  Are you a terrorist?
[01:55:50.335 --> 01:55:53.536]  CI takes charge of frantic weapons of mass destruction search.
[01:55:53.876 --> 01:55:55.557]  They're not going to take over the cover up there.
[01:55:55.597 --> 01:55:56.917]  We'll recap some of the lies.
[01:55:57.398 --> 01:56:08.222]  Turns out those mobile bio-weapons labs the government knew from day one were hydrogen trucks to fill up surveillance dirigibles from the Iran-Iraq war.
[01:56:09.102 --> 01:56:10.403]  Our government has similar systems.
[01:56:11.223 --> 01:56:12.984]  It was even marked as a hydrogen truck.
[01:56:13.144 --> 01:56:18.047]  That got never covered by the media, covered up by our loving government.
[01:56:18.927 --> 01:56:21.628]  They're also saying it's ready for invasion of Iran.
[01:56:21.648 --> 01:56:29.373]  It is all coming up in the next 55, 56 and a half minutes.
[01:56:30.093 --> 01:56:32.034]  A toll-free number to join us on air.
[01:56:32.074 --> 01:56:39.398]  We're going to make a lot of calls in this hour, and I'd love to hear from you on any of these issues I'm covering, or issues I've covered in the last two hours.
[01:56:41.224 --> 01:56:48.509]  Another question is, what do you do about the police dealing drugs, framing innocent people, running hit teams, running prostitution, raping women?
[01:56:50.130 --> 01:57:01.797]  Courts ruling that police, the NYSERC Court of Appeals did rule, have the article here, that police at a crime scene can deny you health care as you're shot or have parts of your body chopped off until you answer questions.
[01:57:01.817 --> 01:57:09.042]  They say, not only is there no Fourth Amendment, or no Fifth Amendment, now you can be tortured by having health care denied.
[01:57:09.062 --> 01:57:10.383]  So it's all part of freedom as well.
[01:57:12.078 --> 01:57:12.958]  That's coming up.
[01:57:13.539 --> 01:57:14.699]  What do you think about all this?
[01:57:14.759 --> 01:57:16.740]  How do you address a system gone insane?
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:27.083]  And in case you missed it, the Justice Department in an official brief admits Patriot Act 1 and 2 are to be used against all criminal prosecutions of every type, state, local, and federal.
[01:57:28.564 --> 01:57:34.086]  Well, we told you the bills said that, but the bills said that, but now it's out in the open after they denied it.
[01:57:35.322 --> 01:57:39.163]  So the total free number to join us on these issues and all other issues you'd like to discuss 1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:39.183 --> 01:57:39.843]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:39.883 --> 01:57:42.264]  I'm a wild man when it comes to freedom.
[01:57:42.284 --> 01:57:42.984]  I love God.
[01:57:43.004 --> 01:57:44.124]  I love my family.
[01:57:44.144 --> 01:57:44.744]  I love this country.
[01:57:45.004 --> 01:57:47.885]  And I'm not going to let a criminal society
[01:57:59.230 --> 01:58:09.453]  A giant collective of crooks and thugs set up their own petty empires locally and feed off us inside this larger criminal apparatus known as the New World Order.
[01:58:09.473 --> 01:58:09.573]  So 800-259-9231.
[01:58:09.693 --> 01:58:11.494]  Your call's got a lot more coming up.
[01:58:14.804 --> 01:58:16.385]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:16.765 --> 01:58:22.507]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:58:22.768 --> 01:58:27.890]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:58:28.230 --> 01:58:37.514]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:58:37.874 --> 01:58:42.817]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:58:43.157 --> 01:58:47.160]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:52.143]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:58:52.503 --> 01:58:58.307]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:58:58.747 --> 01:59:04.952]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:59:05.012 --> 01:59:05.993]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:06.053 --> 01:59:07.254]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:14.657 --> 01:59:18.983]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:59:19.183 --> 01:59:23.609]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:28.156]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:59:28.176 --> 01:59:29.498]  The New World Order.
[01:59:31.305 --> 01:59:35.506]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:59:35.566 --> 01:59:42.507]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:59:42.627 --> 01:59:44.748]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:59:45.048 --> 01:59:55.390]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:59:55.630 --> 01:59:56.510]  If you want to understand
[01:59:56.550 --> 02:00:02.073]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[02:00:20.919 --> 02:00:26.721]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:00:27.061 --> 02:00:28.401]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:00:28.621 --> 02:00:35.883]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:00:36.143 --> 02:00:40.344]  Potassium Iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[02:00:40.564 --> 02:00:42.946]  It works by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:00:43.106 --> 02:00:47.830]  This shields the thyroid and protects it from absorbing the radioactive iodine-131.
[02:00:48.030 --> 02:00:54.936]  There's only one emergency thyroid blocker formulated for babies, children, pets, and adults, and that's Medical Corps Potassium Iodate.
[02:00:55.136 --> 02:00:58.399]  Best of all, unopened bottles can be stored for up to a decade.
[02:00:58.659 --> 02:01:02.082]  Order the official Medical Corps Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:01:04.324 --> 02:01:05.084]  Call toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:01:05.105 --> 02:01:06.725]  Call now and get free shipping.
[02:01:06.845 --> 02:01:07.246]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:01:07.306 --> 02:01:08.346]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:01:08.446 --> 02:01:09.947]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:32.990 --> 02:01:38.212]  All right, Rodney, Steve, Carmen, and others, your calls are coming up here in just about 5-10 minutes.
[02:01:39.233 --> 02:01:50.878]  Then I'm going to get into all the other news we have not covered yet on Patriot Act 2, on what they want to do to your computers, on how riots are rocking Michigan town for two nights straight.
[02:01:50.918 --> 02:01:54.179]  They've called out the National Guard, more on Roe v. Wade.
[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:56.981]  It's all coming up in this hour.
[02:01:58.419 --> 02:02:12.732]  The bottom of the hour in about 22-23 minutes, I've got a particularly important warning for all the listeners and some key analysis on the New World Order plan, so please stay with us for the duration of this hour, this third and final hour.
[02:02:14.039 --> 02:02:16.403]  For the next 5-10 minutes, I want to bring Jack Brownrigg up.
[02:02:16.443 --> 02:02:21.510]  He hasn't been on for a couple months with us from Midas Resources to talk about gold.
[02:02:21.530 --> 02:02:24.014]  It's been hitting $3.80 and then going back down to $3.60.
[02:02:24.054 --> 02:02:27.639]  But if you look at the trend, gold is going straight up.
[02:02:27.799 --> 02:02:28.881]  So are gold stocks.
[02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:32.712]  George Soros said he's dumping dollars to buy gold.
[02:02:33.512 --> 02:02:35.073]  The EU is partially gold back.
[02:02:35.113 --> 02:02:36.554]  Everybody's jumping over to that.
[02:02:37.195 --> 02:02:40.977]  To talk about some of this financial news is Jack Brownrigg.
[02:02:41.417 --> 02:02:47.541]  Jack, good to have you in studio with us, in Studio A up there in Minnesota, there at the network headquarters.
[02:02:47.982 --> 02:02:49.462]  Alex, thanks a lot for having me on.
[02:02:49.703 --> 02:02:51.784]  And you're right, it's been a while since I've been on.
[02:02:52.524 --> 02:02:58.028]  And one of the reasons I'm on today, and I'm really and truly excited being on with you today, Alex,
[02:02:59.139 --> 02:03:08.544]  Is I've got something to offer that I'm only able to offer on the Alex Jones Show to Alex Jones listeners on our Alex line, which is 888-294-6187.
[02:03:09.085 --> 02:03:27.875]  You and I talked a little bit off air an hour or so ago, Alex, about the $10 Olympic gold coins, the commemorative gold coin, the $10 Eagle, half ounce of gold, the only commemorative coin minted, only $10 commemorative coin ever minted.
[02:03:29.665 --> 02:03:32.868]  This has got a coin with an extremely small mintage.
[02:03:33.749 --> 02:03:40.014]  In proof condition, which is what most of them are, there were only 381,000 of those ever minted.
[02:03:40.555 --> 02:03:46.460]  In business strike, or BU, there were less than 76,000 of them minted.
[02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:53.606]  This is a coin that is, I'm not going to say rare, Alex, but it's a coin that it's tough for us to get.
[02:03:54.806 --> 02:03:58.987]  My brokers are screaming at me all the time, we need Oles to sell, we need them to sell.
[02:03:59.007 --> 02:04:00.928]  I don't have them, I don't have them, I don't have them.
[02:04:00.948 --> 02:04:04.908]  Well, Jack, in the three times I bought gold from you, I was always wanting those.
[02:04:04.949 --> 02:04:05.909]  You could never get them.
[02:04:06.089 --> 02:04:07.949]  That's a very true fact, Alex.
[02:04:07.989 --> 02:04:12.810]  You've got some of the $5 commemoratives, which are very nice coin, and I can still offer those.
[02:04:12.970 --> 02:04:15.451]  But, Alex, listeners today,
[02:04:16.981 --> 02:04:18.802]  $10 Olympic gold coins.
[02:04:18.962 --> 02:04:22.603]  I've got about 250 of them committed to me.
[02:04:23.224 --> 02:04:24.804]  I think we can sell them all today.
[02:04:24.844 --> 02:04:25.304]  You know what?
[02:04:25.805 --> 02:04:30.446]  Alex, let's sell 500 of them today and put me to work, because I'll find the other somewhere.
[02:04:31.707 --> 02:04:37.049]  And beyond that, folks, this coin, when it was minted in 1984, when the U.S.
[02:04:37.149 --> 02:04:42.931]  Mint sold the coin to the public, the coin was originally sold at $352.
[02:04:45.413 --> 02:04:46.153]  That's what the U.S.
[02:04:46.193 --> 02:04:47.054]  Mint charged for it.
[02:04:48.454 --> 02:04:52.375]  We're fully 10 to 15 percent below that price.
[02:04:53.155 --> 02:04:55.176]  This is an outstanding buy, folks.
[02:04:55.456 --> 02:04:56.416]  Outstanding.
[02:04:56.756 --> 02:04:59.637]  So you get a semi-numismatic with some collector value.
[02:04:59.737 --> 02:05:01.958]  A lot of collector value, Alex.
[02:05:02.198 --> 02:05:05.239]  In a half ounce, which half ounces and quarter ounces are hard to get.
[02:05:05.419 --> 02:05:06.019]  Yes, they are.
[02:05:06.139 --> 02:05:07.920]  And especially this, the $10
[02:05:08.980 --> 02:05:13.001]  The $10 Olympic coin is just truly a tough coin to find.
[02:05:13.061 --> 02:05:14.561]  It's tough to find in any quantities.
[02:05:14.761 --> 02:05:17.302]  All right, you've got 250 of them, Jack.
[02:05:17.322 --> 02:05:18.202]  I've got 250, Alex.
[02:05:18.482 --> 02:05:23.643]  And the only place these are going to be offered today, folks, write this number down.
[02:05:23.663 --> 02:05:23.703]  888-294-6187.
[02:05:23.723 --> 02:05:24.724]  That's the Alex Jones line.
[02:05:24.744 --> 02:05:25.604]  When it rings,
[02:05:30.535 --> 02:05:31.756]  To one of my brokers.
[02:05:31.796 --> 02:05:34.077]  They know what the offer is on a computer screen.
[02:05:34.137 --> 02:05:34.798]  Yes, they do.
[02:05:34.858 --> 02:05:37.019]  And it's going to say Alex Jones on their phone.
[02:05:37.320 --> 02:05:41.342]  So, you know, listeners of Alex Jones are availed this opportunity.
[02:05:41.943 --> 02:05:42.603]  Nobody else.
[02:05:42.783 --> 02:05:44.344]  It's not on my price sheet.
[02:05:44.444 --> 02:05:46.045]  I'm not going on any other shows.
[02:05:46.846 --> 02:05:48.827]  I'm offering this to your listeners, Alex.
[02:05:49.267 --> 02:05:50.548]  Alright, that toll-free number.
[02:05:50.568 --> 02:05:51.589]  888-294-6187.
[02:05:51.609 --> 02:05:51.769]  I got 250.
[02:05:58.431 --> 02:05:59.612]  And I'll find more.
[02:06:00.132 --> 02:06:08.476]  But I've got 250 $10 Olympic gold coins, some in proof, some in business strike, all in the original package from the Mint.
[02:06:08.516 --> 02:06:10.117]  Nobody's ever touched them with a finger.
[02:06:11.777 --> 02:06:12.638]  For less money,
[02:06:13.459 --> 02:06:15.701]  A lot less money than the Mint sold them in 1984.
[02:06:16.542 --> 02:06:17.983]  They came out at $352 back then.
[02:06:18.023 --> 02:06:20.486]  And that's with gold being up!
[02:06:20.626 --> 02:06:23.729]  Here's the other thing, Alex, what you were saying beforehand.
[02:06:24.009 --> 02:06:27.993]  I love it when you intro me, Alex, because you cover everything that I need to say.
[02:06:29.071 --> 02:06:31.132]  Gold is not just trending up.
[02:06:31.192 --> 02:06:32.112]  Gold is shooting up.
[02:06:32.192 --> 02:06:34.793]  Yes, nothing goes straight up.
[02:06:35.293 --> 02:06:38.814]  But you look at gold, look at gold a year ago, and look at gold today.
[02:06:38.834 --> 02:06:48.438]  If you look at the graph over the last two years, it's gone from 200-something an ounce to 390-something an ounce, and it's staying in the mid-350s, 360s.
[02:06:48.738 --> 02:06:50.098]  That's absolutely right, Alex.
[02:06:50.219 --> 02:06:50.999]  That's absolutely right.
[02:06:51.019 --> 02:06:55.180]  Your base, if you will, your base right now is $80 to $90 higher than it was
[02:06:57.642 --> 02:06:58.625]  Less than a year ago.
[02:06:59.106 --> 02:07:00.169]  And it's getting stronger.
[02:07:00.189 --> 02:07:04.842]  You look at XAU, the gold exchange in Philadelphia.
[02:07:05.538 --> 02:07:20.663]  That was... And this is despite, Jack, the Federal Reserve has been sued and has been caught manipulating, trying to hold down gold prices so that the big banks could buy up all the gold mining systems and try to create an oligopoly like the beers is down with diamonds.
[02:07:20.883 --> 02:07:24.425]  Alex, that's more than a whole other show, but you're absolutely right.
[02:07:24.605 --> 02:07:25.865]  This has been tried.
[02:07:25.885 --> 02:07:27.946]  The controlling interests
[02:07:29.005 --> 02:07:33.746]  of the paper assets are doing everything they can to hold gold prices down.
[02:07:34.186 --> 02:07:36.327]  They cannot be held down forever.
[02:07:36.767 --> 02:07:38.447]  And they are moving up.
[02:07:38.487 --> 02:07:43.189]  They're moving up on a, I think, a rather astounding level.
[02:07:43.249 --> 02:07:45.549]  As you said, look at those graphs.
[02:07:45.649 --> 02:07:49.970]  Anybody who's got a computer can look at the graph and pull up a chart.
[02:07:52.991 --> 02:07:56.012]  You talk to your paper asset guy and he doesn't want to talk to you about gold.
[02:07:57.365 --> 02:08:01.329]  The reason he doesn't want to talk to you about gold is... Well, I know this.
[02:08:01.489 --> 02:08:04.752]  Gold can go down or gold can go up, but it's always going to have value.
[02:08:04.832 --> 02:08:05.633]  There's the whole thing.
[02:08:05.653 --> 02:08:09.256]  And many of the 401ks are down by 80%.
[02:08:09.877 --> 02:08:12.379]  On average, it's what, about 65% they're down.
[02:08:12.799 --> 02:08:13.240]  That's right.
[02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:17.304]  And the stock market goes up and down, but you look at the three-year trend, it's going straight down.
[02:08:17.324 --> 02:08:20.827]  There's a few spikes up, but the next time it drops even further down,
[02:08:21.327 --> 02:08:22.067]  Smart move.
[02:08:22.448 --> 02:08:23.788]  What's that number again, Jack?
[02:08:23.888 --> 02:08:24.729]  The number is 888-294-6187.
[02:08:24.889 --> 02:08:29.311]  That's the Alex Jones line.
[02:08:29.331 --> 02:08:32.452]  You're going to be talking to one of my brokers at Midas Resources.
[02:08:33.873 --> 02:08:38.775]  You'll tell them you need those $10 coins that are offered only on Alex's show.
[02:08:38.975 --> 02:08:42.417]  And you could get off a plane in Japan or Russia or Latin America
[02:08:43.095 --> 02:08:50.361]  We have thousands of dollars of gold coins in your wallet, unobtrusive, and that stuff will be traded and accepted anywhere on the planet.
[02:08:50.721 --> 02:08:57.126]  If you fell out of a helicopter in the midst of a bunch of pygmies, they would understand the value of that gold.
[02:08:57.567 --> 02:08:59.949]  They wouldn't understand the value of $100 bills.
[02:09:00.089 --> 02:09:00.569]  That's right.
[02:09:00.609 --> 02:09:01.790]  Three words here, Alex.
[02:09:02.151 --> 02:09:02.511]  Liquid,
[02:09:03.246 --> 02:09:03.666]  Private.
[02:09:04.186 --> 02:09:04.627]  Portable.
[02:09:04.947 --> 02:09:05.487]  Three words.
[02:09:05.567 --> 02:09:06.107]  It's liquid.
[02:09:06.388 --> 02:09:06.968]  It's private.
[02:09:07.368 --> 02:09:08.008]  It's portable.
[02:09:08.428 --> 02:09:10.710]  Well, I bought some gold myself and I checked around.
[02:09:10.750 --> 02:09:11.770]  You know, I looked for much.
[02:09:12.410 --> 02:09:17.733]  Then I decided that for the price and for the privacy that Midas is on the low end.
[02:09:17.773 --> 02:09:19.454]  You can find a lot of people that are more.
[02:09:19.874 --> 02:09:21.355]  Some that are lower, but not much.
[02:09:21.895 --> 02:09:24.156]  And Midas is the founding company of Genesis.
[02:09:24.176 --> 02:09:25.156]  We tell you that up front.
[02:09:25.477 --> 02:09:26.277]  They have pumped
[02:09:27.185 --> 02:09:28.046]  Let's just be honest.
[02:09:28.106 --> 02:09:31.408]  Millions of dollars into the network, and made of the success it is.
[02:09:31.448 --> 02:09:32.669]  So you do a lot of things at once.
[02:09:32.689 --> 02:09:36.772]  You protect your assets, support the broadcast, and you get a good deal.
[02:09:37.032 --> 02:09:38.253]  That number one more time, Jack.
[02:09:38.393 --> 02:09:39.633]  That number one more time is 888-294-6187.
[02:09:39.653 --> 02:09:43.016]  $10 Olympic gold coins for Alex Jones listeners only.
[02:09:43.136 --> 02:09:44.377]  That number slowly, Jack.
[02:09:44.397 --> 02:09:44.437]  888-294-6187.
[02:09:51.244 --> 02:09:52.004]  294-6187.
[02:09:52.024 --> 02:09:54.466]  And folks, this is not a gimmick.
[02:09:56.247 --> 02:09:57.608]  This is the amount of coin he's got.
[02:09:57.708 --> 02:09:58.388]  This is the price.
[02:09:58.468 --> 02:10:00.549]  It's set at the price now, whether it goes up or down.
[02:10:00.929 --> 02:10:01.950]  You're getting a good deal.
[02:10:02.630 --> 02:10:07.914]  And all the time, when we do these offers, when it's 250 coins or 300, they run out within hours.
[02:10:08.554 --> 02:10:10.635]  And so if you call tomorrow, these will probably be gone.
[02:10:11.816 --> 02:10:13.157]  You know for a fact that happens.
[02:10:13.217 --> 02:10:14.638]  We run out and we can't deliver.
[02:10:15.679 --> 02:10:18.388]  I mean, we can't deliver what we offered on the coins.
[02:10:18.428 --> 02:10:20.415]  We have to tell them that, you know, that's sold out.
[02:10:20.979 --> 02:10:21.860]  Yeah, so they will tell you.
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:25.242]  They have on the computer how many are left when they do a trade or a deal.
[02:10:25.522 --> 02:10:26.923]  It's on the computer how many are left.
[02:10:27.584 --> 02:10:29.385]  And when they're gone, they'll tell you no.
[02:10:29.425 --> 02:10:34.308]  In fact, I've called on offers we've done before, wanting to buy that gold myself the next day because I get so busy.
[02:10:34.628 --> 02:10:36.109]  And Jack says, sorry Alex, they're gone.
[02:10:36.129 --> 02:10:36.830]  You want something else?
[02:10:37.050 --> 02:10:37.510]  That's true.
[02:10:37.690 --> 02:10:39.151]  That is absolutely true, Alex.
[02:10:39.451 --> 02:10:40.032]  Alright, Jack.
[02:10:40.072 --> 02:10:40.772]  I appreciate you.
[02:10:40.852 --> 02:10:41.493]  Yeah, it's true.
[02:10:41.513 --> 02:10:42.233]  It happens a lot.
[02:10:43.314 --> 02:10:44.395]  But it's like that everywhere.
[02:10:44.435 --> 02:10:46.897]  I mean, people are just snatching the actual gold coin up.
[02:10:47.057 --> 02:10:47.477]  That's right.
[02:10:48.355 --> 02:10:50.416]  Alright, well thanks for coming on Jack, I appreciate it.
[02:10:50.856 --> 02:10:51.397]  God bless you.
[02:10:52.137 --> 02:10:52.917]  Alright, we're going to break.
[02:10:53.618 --> 02:11:00.061]  When we come back, I promise, we're going to go straight to all the callers that are holding.
[02:11:01.542 --> 02:11:13.308]  So we'll go to Rodney and Steve and Carmen, everybody else directly after this quick break, and then I've got a special announcement about the police state and a warning to everybody at the bottom of the hour in about 15 minutes.
[02:11:15.467 --> 02:11:26.837]  And I've got a bunch of other news about the police state and how Senator Hatch, who is just a horrible creature, like Chuckie Schumer on steroids, but they call him a conservative.
[02:11:28.699 --> 02:11:30.020]  We've got this creature in there.
[02:11:30.080 --> 02:11:32.562]  He wants the feds hooked into all your computers.
[02:11:32.682 --> 02:11:34.684]  Yes, openly, publicly.
[02:11:35.965 --> 02:11:40.289]  And the same system wants to be hooked up to all your TVs, radios, everything.
[02:11:41.461 --> 02:11:42.862]  It's just wait till you hear about it.
[02:11:42.902 --> 02:11:43.922]  It's out of control.
[02:11:44.042 --> 02:11:45.923]  Also the Zacharias Moussaoui case.
[02:11:46.323 --> 02:11:48.664]  He says the government is basically behind the attacks.
[02:11:48.764 --> 02:11:49.744]  No kidding, folks.
[02:11:50.885 --> 02:11:51.465]  No kidding.
[02:11:53.046 --> 02:11:54.546]  And that's the facts on that.
[02:11:54.606 --> 02:11:55.827]  That is coming up as well.
[02:11:55.967 --> 02:11:58.668]  And the riots rocking Michigan Town for second night straight.
[02:11:58.728 --> 02:12:00.468]  Going into the third night here in a few hours.
[02:12:00.508 --> 02:12:01.689]  They got the National Guard out.
[02:12:02.814 --> 02:12:20.720]  Amanda, we'll be first going to your calls, but I do hope that everybody goes to Infowars.com, Infowars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com and reads the long train of abuses, the corruption, the evil that this illegitimate government and its allied crime syndicates aren't engaging in.
[02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:23.260]  Government has become rotten.
[02:12:23.901 --> 02:12:25.021]  We've got to fix it.
[02:12:25.561 --> 02:12:26.681]  We can't accept it.
[02:12:27.182 --> 02:12:29.482]  It's not just going to stay stationary at the point it's at.
[02:12:30.002 --> 02:12:31.603]  It doesn't stay like that in stasis.
[02:12:32.285 --> 02:12:35.967]  Either corruption gets better or it gets worse, and we're going in the worst column.
[02:12:36.448 --> 02:12:49.275]  Things are rapidly plunging into tyranny never before seen across between 1984, Soviet Russia, and Olvis Huxley's Brave New World.
[02:12:50.836 --> 02:12:54.018]  We'll come back and take your calls, and then get into more news.
[02:12:54.058 --> 02:12:55.119]  I've got a special announcement.

[02:17:30.252 --> 02:17:36.598]  Before I go to Rodney and Steve and Carmen and Bob and Elaine and others.
[02:17:36.958 --> 02:17:39.260]  I know Elaine's on a cell phone so we'll go to her a little bit earlier.
[02:17:41.295 --> 02:17:46.380]  I'm getting calls here at my office asking what that number is on the gold coins.
[02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:48.742]  Let me say this one more time, folks.
[02:17:48.762 --> 02:17:49.202]  888-294-6187.
[02:17:49.222 --> 02:17:49.262]  888-294-6187.
[02:17:49.282 --> 02:17:51.984]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to Rodney in Texas.
[02:17:52.004 --> 02:17:52.985]  You're on the air.
[02:17:53.005 --> 02:17:54.106]  Thanks for holding.
[02:17:54.126 --> 02:17:54.467]  Go ahead.
[02:17:54.667 --> 02:17:55.988]  How you doing there, Alex?
[02:17:56.008 --> 02:17:57.169]  Pretty good, my friend.
[02:18:06.744 --> 02:18:12.530]  Yeah, I mean, some of the stuff that's happening with these court rulings are really, really, really scary.
[02:18:12.650 --> 02:18:23.322]  They can take your land, they can torture you, they can grab citizens under Patriot Act for any crime, they can secretly execute you, on and they can forcibly drug you, on and on and on and on.
[02:18:23.342 --> 02:18:28.688]  I just don't see any difference between this and, you know, the Adolf Hitler.
[02:18:29.108 --> 02:18:36.232]  The only difference is they don't have enough cops that are willing to carry it out, and all the judges aren't corrupt, and there's too many activists blowing the whistle.
[02:18:36.813 --> 02:18:45.058]  I mean, this ruling from the Ninth Circuit, I'd be interested to see what the actual comments were from the judges.
[02:18:45.078 --> 02:18:46.138]  Well, I've got the article here.
[02:18:46.178 --> 02:18:48.660]  It happened last week, and they said that
[02:18:50.003 --> 02:18:58.166]  That the officer just can't use it in court, but they can deny medical care, when you've been shot or hurt, and ask questions.
[02:18:58.286 --> 02:18:59.127]  I mean, that's what they said.
[02:18:59.367 --> 02:19:02.048]  And there wouldn't be any kind of repercussions to the officer?
[02:19:02.208 --> 02:19:07.710]  No, you can have your arm cut off, bleeding to death, and they can stand over you saying, answer my questions or I won't call the ambulance.
[02:19:07.950 --> 02:19:16.273]  And if the person is delirious or, oh, no, no, this, I just, I don't... Well, imagine where it goes from here.
[02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:20.181]  That's what I'm afraid to.
[02:19:20.641 --> 02:19:22.762]  I'm imagining right now and it's scary.
[02:19:23.343 --> 02:19:23.663]  It really is.
[02:19:23.683 --> 02:19:33.948]  Well, Ashcroft's Justice Department finally said on Monday, got the Washington Times article, they said, yep, we're going to use Patriot Act 1 and 2 for every crime and every criminal investigation, not just terror.
[02:19:33.968 --> 02:19:37.270]  No, I had a question about this Patriot Act 2.
[02:19:38.710 --> 02:19:40.411]  It's kind of a hypothetical.
[02:19:41.972 --> 02:19:44.734]  If in fact the Patriot Act 2 was passed,
[02:19:46.365 --> 02:19:49.046]  Wouldn't we basically be under martial law?
[02:19:49.987 --> 02:19:57.450]  We were under martial law according to the Washington Times Constitutional Scholar four days after 9-1-1 when Bush activated the 500 provisions.
[02:19:58.350 --> 02:20:02.092]  They're already implementing Patriot Act 2 before its passage piecemeal.
[02:20:03.135 --> 02:20:04.937]  Okay, secret execution of citizens.
[02:20:04.977 --> 02:20:05.438]  That's in there.
[02:20:05.458 --> 02:20:07.159]  They're already getting court rulings on that.
[02:20:07.340 --> 02:20:09.542]  So, we're under martial law, sir.
[02:20:09.602 --> 02:20:12.625]  It's what increment will they get away with implementing?
[02:20:12.986 --> 02:20:19.573]  Yeah, see, the reason why I ask this is because I had a discussion with some of my office associates this morning.
[02:20:19.893 --> 02:20:22.356]  Basically, we believe that
[02:20:23.246 --> 02:20:26.989]  Bush doesn't intend to have another election here.
[02:20:27.090 --> 02:20:29.732]  The dictatorship isn't by Bush or Clinton or any of them.
[02:20:29.772 --> 02:20:30.693]  They're just front men.
[02:20:31.013 --> 02:20:31.173]  Right.
[02:20:31.193 --> 02:20:32.314]  The dictatorship is here.
[02:20:32.374 --> 02:20:34.196]  It's called the Military-Industrial Complex.
[02:20:34.556 --> 02:20:35.577]  You've got to recognize that.
[02:20:35.637 --> 02:20:36.238]  Thanks for the call.
[02:20:36.598 --> 02:20:36.858]  All right.
[02:20:37.619 --> 02:20:45.265]  What they do is they empower world government, Rodney, and they move on to be heads of NATO, heads of the UN, which Clinton's about to do.
[02:20:45.305 --> 02:20:45.906]  That's coming up.
[02:20:46.446 --> 02:20:47.147]  But great points.
[02:20:47.167 --> 02:20:48.088]  Thanks for the call, Rodney.
[02:20:48.820 --> 02:20:49.821]  Steve in Delaware.
[02:20:49.861 --> 02:20:50.901]  You're on the air, Steve.
[02:20:51.101 --> 02:20:54.744]  Yeah, you made the statement that the aircraft on 9-11, no one was in them?
[02:20:55.964 --> 02:20:58.506]  Yes, the preponderance of evidence shows that conclusively.
[02:20:58.646 --> 02:21:01.187]  Nine of the 19 hijackers are still alive.
[02:21:01.688 --> 02:21:05.650]  Okay, so there were passengers on board.
[02:21:06.170 --> 02:21:07.391]  We don't know that either, sir.
[02:21:07.938 --> 02:21:11.741]  Well, I was going to say, now let's just say that there's only 100 people on each plane.
[02:21:11.861 --> 02:21:15.764]  It was actually all at precisely 20% occupancy.
[02:21:16.104 --> 02:21:28.493]  The AP did a study of it and found that almost all other planes in that region were at 95 to 98% capacity, but magically, the four computers malfunctioned in two different airlines and only 20% were allowed to be seated.
[02:21:29.053 --> 02:21:31.675]  Okay, well let's just say that there was only 20% then.
[02:21:31.715 --> 02:21:34.878]  Let's say there's only 20 people on each aircraft, okay?
[02:21:35.038 --> 02:21:35.238]  Yes.
[02:21:35.894 --> 02:21:40.235]  Okay, you're still talking sixteen memorial services that people were fooled at?
[02:21:41.256 --> 02:21:42.636]  Well, sir, I'm going to give you the facts.
[02:21:43.136 --> 02:21:44.197]  I'm going to give you the facts.
[02:21:45.157 --> 02:21:47.458]  Nine of the nineteen hijackers are still alive.
[02:21:47.518 --> 02:21:48.278]  I don't care about them.
[02:21:48.798 --> 02:21:50.559]  Let me give you the details here.
[02:21:51.199 --> 02:21:52.519]  And I'll hold you over if need be.
[02:21:54.400 --> 02:21:58.341]  The FBI paid for most of their cars, their houses, everything.
[02:21:59.162 --> 02:21:59.962]  They were trained at U.S.
[02:22:00.002 --> 02:22:02.843]  military bases, Defense Language School, Monterey, California.
[02:22:03.730 --> 02:22:06.973]  Uh, the flying school there at Pensacola Naval Air Station.
[02:22:06.993 --> 02:22:08.794]  That's MSNBC Associated Press.
[02:22:10.355 --> 02:22:11.936]  I have talked to people in and out of government.
[02:22:11.956 --> 02:22:15.379]  I've talked to Stanley Hilton, the lawyer, who's suing the government for involvement.
[02:22:15.779 --> 02:22:16.720]  He's deposed them.
[02:22:17.100 --> 02:22:17.981]  The evidence is clear.
[02:22:18.041 --> 02:22:19.842]  There weren't even people on board those aircraft.
[02:22:20.162 --> 02:22:24.846]  They were CIA assets simply to be seen at the scenes of the crime.
[02:22:25.453 --> 02:22:27.974]  The aircraft banked the two that hit the towers.
[02:22:28.535 --> 02:22:30.556]  One of them, it pulled seven G's.
[02:22:30.916 --> 02:22:31.716]  I saw it, yes.
[02:22:31.916 --> 02:22:33.517]  This is what pilots have said.
[02:22:33.577 --> 02:22:36.419]  The fly-by-wire system cannot allow that.
[02:22:36.439 --> 02:22:39.761]  Are you beginning to understand?
[02:22:39.781 --> 02:22:43.983]  There was a press conference held by hundreds of former US military officers.
[02:22:44.697 --> 02:22:57.467]  In Portugal last year, a 30-plus hour press conference where they talked until collapse, saying there is no way that even fighter ace pilots with thousands of hours in commercial liners can pull the maneuvers.
[02:22:57.928 --> 02:23:00.169]  Only fly-by-wire could achieve it.
[02:23:00.209 --> 02:23:01.991]  Stay there, we'll discuss it on the other side.
[02:23:05.213 --> 02:23:08.256]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:23:08.276 --> 02:23:11.819]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:19.123]  I'm on the phone with Marilyn from Colvera who's going to explain a little bit about this new diet.
[02:23:19.423 --> 02:23:20.444]  Marilyn, tell us about it.
[02:23:20.604 --> 02:23:22.845]  Well, it's a collagen protein supplement.
[02:23:23.065 --> 02:23:25.267]  It has collagen, aloe vera, and glycerin.
[02:23:25.287 --> 02:23:25.607]  888-803-4438.
[02:23:25.627 --> 02:23:27.128]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:23:48.592 --> 02:23:49.933]  All right, folks.
[02:23:50.033 --> 02:24:02.226]  Elaine, Carmen, Bob, you guys will be the last callers after Steve because I've got to get into some of the news and the warning to everyone about the New World Order tactics and their program of enslavement.
[02:24:03.217 --> 02:24:14.794]  But, uh, continuing, Steve, in Delaware, the reason I said they were remote controls, we know these technologies are there, we know the planes pulled Gs they couldn't pull with pilots with the standard fly-by-wire programs and overrides.
[02:24:15.806 --> 02:24:23.288]  We also know that the government was running a quote CIA drill that morning from a nearby air base.
[02:24:24.629 --> 02:24:31.051]  Let me finish, this has been in the Associated Press, of flying hijacked jet airliners into buildings in a quote drill.
[02:24:31.371 --> 02:24:34.532]  That's how they ordered NORAD to stand down and say it was a drill.
[02:24:34.912 --> 02:24:40.874]  We know the White House, right when the transponders got turned off, was already on the phone with NORAD, CIA,
[02:24:42.174 --> 02:24:45.058]  And the airport's FAA telling them to stand down.
[02:24:45.098 --> 02:24:45.939]  That's now come out.
[02:24:46.379 --> 02:24:47.080]  Let me continue.
[02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:48.582]  Then we have the Northwoods plan.
[02:24:48.962 --> 02:24:49.963]  The official U.S.
[02:24:50.003 --> 02:24:53.968]  government plan where they call for remote controlling jetliners.
[02:24:54.308 --> 02:24:59.194]  They said preferably full of young Americans because Americans get madder when young people die.
[02:24:59.754 --> 02:25:01.035]  Blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:25:01.055 --> 02:25:23.855]  You add all that together, a bunch of the hijackers still alive, the others having their houses and cars paid for by the government, you add passports fluttering down out of the sky at the World Trade Center crash and at the Pennsylvania crash, unseared passports with their names falling down out of the sky, you add all this together,
[02:25:24.475 --> 02:25:26.797]  They say it was hijackers with no evidence.
[02:25:27.318 --> 02:25:29.619]  I say they remote control them with massive evidence.
[02:25:29.639 --> 02:25:30.100]  There you go.
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:36.905]  And all the people that went to the memorial services that knew the people who are no longer here are being paid off?
[02:25:37.506 --> 02:25:38.467]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:25:38.487 --> 02:25:40.328]  They don't have to be part of the system.
[02:25:40.889 --> 02:25:48.435]  No, they load family on board, they remote control the planes, turn the systems off, and got a flying coffin.
[02:25:49.716 --> 02:25:50.636]  That's how that works.
[02:25:50.776 --> 02:25:55.058]  So, none of the flight attendants and the pilots, I mean, were on board?
[02:25:55.218 --> 02:26:00.340]  Well, under national security, all of those tapes have been seized and none of those have been released.
[02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:02.701]  Well, I'm talking about, I mean, the funeral services?
[02:26:02.781 --> 02:26:03.901]  I mean, all the people?
[02:26:03.921 --> 02:26:06.162]  No, I didn't say there weren't people on board the aircraft.
[02:26:06.282 --> 02:26:07.343]  I'm talking about the pilots.
[02:26:07.363 --> 02:26:08.423]  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[02:26:08.883 --> 02:26:09.664]  You're not listening to me.
[02:26:09.684 --> 02:26:11.584]  Pilots and flight crews, I mean, their funeral services?
[02:26:11.684 --> 02:26:14.506]  I mean, all of their... Yes, the government remote controlled the aircraft in.
[02:26:14.606 --> 02:26:17.387]  If you didn't hear all the evidence, I just stated there's about 500 other pieces.
[02:26:19.548 --> 02:26:23.792]  I'd like to know, like I said, you know, how did they buy off all of the people who went to the memorial services?
[02:26:24.133 --> 02:26:25.934]  Uh, how do people know?
[02:26:26.275 --> 02:26:30.359]  They have family on board, the plane gets remote controlled into a building, they don't know.
[02:26:30.759 --> 02:26:33.962]  So the pilots and the flight crews' families were all on board?
[02:26:35.183 --> 02:26:40.949]  Yes, the evidence shows the planes were shut down, the communications have been seized under national security.
[02:26:42.214 --> 02:26:42.935]  You didn't know that?
[02:26:43.296 --> 02:26:43.896]  Yes, I knew that.
[02:26:43.936 --> 02:26:44.237]  I know.
[02:26:44.257 --> 02:26:45.178]  Let me add something.
[02:26:45.538 --> 02:26:54.028]  I'm the guy who calls up firefighters who are in the newspaper saying bombs were going off and the fires were out and the firefighter tells me I've been told not to talk.
[02:26:54.128 --> 02:26:54.729]  I'm afraid.
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:26:59.762]  Firefighter engineering says that bombs clearly had to go off, that there's a cover-up.
[02:27:00.462 --> 02:27:04.544]  Building 7 imploded in 3.3 seconds, faster than it could physically fall.
[02:27:04.564 --> 02:27:06.284]  No plane hit it.
[02:27:06.665 --> 02:27:11.847]  You start adding all these pieces together, the evidence shows they were remote-controlled.
[02:27:12.167 --> 02:27:16.509]  It is impossible for four hijackers to do what they did, number one.
[02:27:16.849 --> 02:27:18.790]  Number two, nine of them were still alive.
[02:27:19.050 --> 02:27:21.731]  Number three, the CIA was running a drill that morning.
[02:27:21.971 --> 02:27:23.173]  of carrying out these plans.
[02:27:23.413 --> 02:27:25.196]  Number four, we have an official U.S.
[02:27:25.236 --> 02:27:32.848]  government plan called Northwoods, where they call for remote controlling jets full of passengers into the ground!
[02:27:34.580 --> 02:27:35.780]  We have a confession!
[02:27:36.040 --> 02:27:38.041]  We have an official plan, sir!
[02:27:38.341 --> 02:27:40.522]  You have a confession that's been admitted into court?
[02:27:40.722 --> 02:27:41.122]  Yes.
[02:27:41.582 --> 02:27:43.543]  It's called Operation Northwoods.
[02:27:43.743 --> 02:27:45.123]  On Infowars.com.
[02:27:45.203 --> 02:27:46.063]  ABC News.
[02:27:46.103 --> 02:27:47.063]  Baltimore Sun.
[02:27:47.664 --> 02:27:48.304]  A U.S.
[02:27:48.424 --> 02:27:51.885]  government plan to kill young people.
[02:27:51.925 --> 02:27:57.646]  They said a plane load full of kids would be preferable to remote control it into the ground.
[02:27:57.666 --> 02:28:00.127]  To blame it on foreign enemies.
[02:28:01.247 --> 02:28:03.068]  Well, we'll be talking again today, sir.
[02:28:03.638 --> 02:28:04.759]  All right, appreciate the call.
[02:28:05.999 --> 02:28:09.160]  The reason I start ranting and raving is because I'm in a hurry here.
[02:28:10.481 --> 02:28:11.982]  Yeah, I got the facts, folks.
[02:28:12.182 --> 02:28:12.842]  Bottom line.
[02:28:13.742 --> 02:28:18.144]  Oh, and the victims' families have been told to shut up or they don't get the payoffs.
[02:28:18.965 --> 02:28:23.607]  Oh, and by the way, the globalists are managing that right under the ground.
[02:28:23.627 --> 02:28:29.129]  They try to declare under national security the interviews with the families before Congress.
[02:28:29.149 --> 02:28:30.790]  I wonder why they're trying to make that secret.
[02:28:31.597 --> 02:28:34.238]  Why are they making the audio tapes of the Fireman's Secret?
[02:28:34.258 --> 02:28:36.619]  They said all their radios malfunctioned?
[02:28:36.859 --> 02:28:37.620]  That wasn't true!
[02:28:37.860 --> 02:28:39.680]  They've seized those international security!
[02:28:41.141 --> 02:28:42.441]  Start putting the pieces together!
[02:28:42.942 --> 02:28:45.002]  Those planes couldn't have physically done that!
[02:28:45.363 --> 02:28:47.383]  A bunch of the hijackers are still alive!
[02:28:49.384 --> 02:28:51.705]  And now Zacharias Moussaoui is saying the same thing.
[02:28:51.745 --> 02:28:54.426]  Let's go ahead and talk to Elaine in Texas.
[02:28:54.486 --> 02:28:55.307]  I gotta go quick here.
[02:28:55.327 --> 02:28:56.027]  Elaine, go ahead.
[02:28:57.788 --> 02:29:01.089]  I didn't realize what you were saying about the Supreme Court.
[02:29:02.039 --> 02:29:19.165]  I read the Austin Statesman yesterday, and I have it here, and it's saying, and it's got a Washington Post byline there, it's saying, by a 6-3 vote, the court ruled that lower federal courts had mistakenly authorized prosecutors to require St.
[02:29:19.205 --> 02:29:22.866]  Louis dentist Charsell to take medications.
[02:29:23.506 --> 02:29:27.568]  But then later on in the article, it's saying, it's saying that
[02:29:28.942 --> 02:29:46.688]  Breyer says involuntary medication must significantly further an important government objective and must substantially likely render the defendant competent and substantially unlikely to produce side effects.
[02:29:47.489 --> 02:29:50.130]  Now, this is like two different things it's saying here.
[02:29:50.350 --> 02:29:51.250]  Ma'am, that's what I said.
[02:29:51.770 --> 02:29:53.551]  I didn't even realize that.
[02:29:53.851 --> 02:29:55.011]  Ma'am, let me explain this.
[02:29:55.632 --> 02:29:56.412]  They will say
[02:29:57.392 --> 02:30:00.715]  Campaign finance reform gets dirty money out of politics.
[02:30:01.355 --> 02:30:02.096]  It's a good thing.
[02:30:02.776 --> 02:30:09.901]  You read the law, it says it doubles the amount of money of soft cash contributions from corporations.
[02:30:09.941 --> 02:30:11.523]  The dirtiest type of money, it doubles.
[02:30:12.203 --> 02:30:19.568]  Then it won't allow you to give money, your organization to give money, and it won't allow me to interview, say, Larry Pratt 60 days before an election.
[02:30:20.509 --> 02:30:20.849]  Okay?
[02:30:21.850 --> 02:30:22.991]  So is it reform?
[02:30:23.111 --> 02:30:23.892]  Is it good reform?
[02:30:23.932 --> 02:30:24.072]  No.
[02:30:24.984 --> 02:30:27.985]  Uh, they passed a law to make your medical records public two years ago.
[02:30:28.165 --> 02:30:30.306]  The news said it was a privacy law.
[02:30:31.687 --> 02:30:31.967]  Okay?
[02:30:32.167 --> 02:30:32.467]  Okay.
[02:30:32.647 --> 02:30:41.351]  The ruling says, oh, we love you, we don't, we care about your rights, some of the lower courts aren't perfect, but you can forcibly drug whoever you want.
[02:30:42.352 --> 02:30:48.514]  So, exactly, as I said, here's the Washington Times headline, High Court Okays Forcible Medication for Defendants.
[02:30:49.435 --> 02:30:54.417]  Then you read the Washington Post headline, I'm trying to dig it out right now, and it says that court limits
[02:30:55.849 --> 02:30:56.929]  Well, no, it doesn't.
[02:30:57.069 --> 02:31:01.570]  It just says, if there isn't a substantial risk, the drugs won't kill you, they can.
[02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:06.391]  The whole article reads as if they're not going to do it.
[02:31:06.451 --> 02:31:08.272]  I didn't even catch it until you said this.
[02:31:08.392 --> 02:31:12.352]  I went back and got the article, and it's like, crap, it's right there.
[02:31:12.612 --> 02:31:14.693]  Yeah, ma'am, it's double speak.
[02:31:15.073 --> 02:31:15.673]  It sure is.
[02:31:15.973 --> 02:31:16.753]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:31:16.793 --> 02:31:17.213]  Thank you.
[02:31:17.233 --> 02:31:17.913]  Appreciate it.
[02:31:18.093 --> 02:31:20.634]  And now I've lost my list of callers here.
[02:31:22.924 --> 02:31:24.504]  Carmen Maryland, you're on the air.
[02:31:24.564 --> 02:31:25.285]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:31:25.705 --> 02:31:27.125]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:31:27.505 --> 02:31:27.805]  You bet.
[02:31:27.825 --> 02:31:28.846]  Good to talk to you.
[02:31:29.566 --> 02:31:35.948]  What I think, to sum it up, I think it's just basically tyranny at the worst level you could possibly imagine.
[02:31:36.648 --> 02:31:40.469]  I mean, on a scale of 1 to 10, I don't know if you agree, but I think we're at least a 9.
[02:31:41.826 --> 02:31:42.906]  You know, close to a ten?
[02:31:42.926 --> 02:31:46.987]  Well, with the setup of the infrastructure, yes, we're at about a nine.
[02:31:47.367 --> 02:31:51.948]  According to old systems of tyranny, we're way past a nine.
[02:31:51.968 --> 02:31:55.589]  You know, you have to create a whole new graph of increased levels.
[02:31:56.109 --> 02:31:58.490]  But on implementation, we're only at about a six.
[02:31:59.270 --> 02:32:01.790]  I wrote an article on a scale of one to ten about four years ago.
[02:32:01.830 --> 02:32:03.591]  I said we were at a three and a half.
[02:32:04.651 --> 02:32:06.311]  And now we're at about a six, brother.
[02:32:06.691 --> 02:32:09.012]  And after the next big terror attack, we're going to go to an eight.
[02:32:09.847 --> 02:32:11.749]  Let me ask you, I'll just make a suggestion.
[02:32:12.189 --> 02:32:30.568]  Why don't you and John Stantmiller, why don't we get together, set a date, you know, I mean pick a date in the next couple of months, whenever you have the time, I know you're very busy and so is John, but I mean, let's just go to Washington, let's get as many Patriots as we possibly can, go to Washington,
[02:32:31.289 --> 02:32:36.750]  With a redress of grievances and just shut Washington down and say, look, you guys have to stop doing this.
[02:32:37.390 --> 02:32:38.991]  You're way off the Constitution.
[02:32:39.011 --> 02:32:41.811]  I mean, to me, the Constitution is gone.
[02:32:42.652 --> 02:32:44.232]  You know, I mean, we have to make a voice.
[02:32:44.712 --> 02:32:47.193]  I mean, what you're doing with the tapes and everything, that's admirable.
[02:32:47.313 --> 02:32:48.293]  That's fantastic.
[02:32:48.353 --> 02:32:49.773]  And information is the key.
[02:32:49.813 --> 02:32:54.054]  But I mean, we have to have a show that they can't just do this anymore.
[02:32:54.074 --> 02:32:57.175]  I mean, they're basically trashing everything that the founding fathers
[02:32:57.785 --> 02:32:59.966]  You know, held true to their hearts.
[02:33:00.266 --> 02:33:01.627]  Alright, let me break this down for you.
[02:33:01.647 --> 02:33:05.068]  This is a perfect time, Carmen, to talk about this.
[02:33:05.088 --> 02:33:07.109]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:33:07.129 --> 02:33:08.049]  Let me comment on it now.
[02:33:08.650 --> 02:33:10.170]  And I'll take a few final calls and that's it.
[02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.891]  I've got to cover news.
[02:33:12.191 --> 02:33:15.352]  My warning, my announcement to you is this.
[02:33:17.593 --> 02:33:24.996]  And perhaps, if it's somewhat coherent, we can make a text of this and post it on InfoWars.com.
[02:33:25.057 --> 02:33:25.917]  I intend to write
[02:33:26.781 --> 02:33:54.987]  up a warning for people and post it on InfoWars.com but I just never seem to have time to do this the government tomorrow if they have the corrupt personnel they need to have the will to carry it out and if it's in their time frame can have an informant or police officer claim that they heard me talking about bombs which of course is totally untrue and false
[02:33:57.030 --> 02:34:02.892]  A informant tomorrow could say they saw you dealing drugs and you could serve twenty to ninety years in prison.
[02:34:04.212 --> 02:34:08.833]  The informant can even be caught planting drugs on you and the courts will still rule that you stay in jail.
[02:34:11.874 --> 02:34:16.575]  So my point is we have a corrupt government now who sees it as an us against them mentality.
[02:34:16.995 --> 02:34:18.415]  They enjoy feeding on us.
[02:34:18.435 --> 02:34:20.136]  They're training the government and their minions.
[02:34:20.736 --> 02:34:25.037]  The Christians, gun owners, conservatives are all enemies of the government.
[02:34:27.947 --> 02:34:33.774]  And I hear everybody calling into the show saying, you know, we gotta take physical action, we gotta do this now, we gotta stand up and fight.
[02:34:35.456 --> 02:34:39.081]  Folks, the government has to blow up its own stuff to blame it on us.
[02:34:41.364 --> 02:34:46.490]  To get its minions to get in a beehive, uh, stirred up mentality.
[02:34:49.272 --> 02:34:57.216]  They have to carry out terror against their own institutions, their own abortion clinics, their own government buildings to blame it on the good people of America as a pretext.
[02:34:57.236 --> 02:35:07.681]  They have to hire provocateurs to beat up cops and burn trash cans at rallies to then blame it on the 10,000, 50,000, 100,000 peaceful protesters so the riot police can then attack them.
[02:35:08.501 --> 02:35:11.623]  They use violence to silence political opposition.
[02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:16.041]  They use violence in Israel.
[02:35:16.161 --> 02:35:17.582]  Israel founded Hamas.
[02:35:17.982 --> 02:35:18.703]  That is admitted.
[02:35:18.763 --> 02:35:23.225]  United Press International, Haratz Newspaper, you know, all these publications.
[02:35:23.285 --> 02:35:24.086]  It's admitted fact.
[02:35:24.466 --> 02:35:25.487]  They found Hamas.
[02:35:26.067 --> 02:35:27.448]  They grab young Palestinians.
[02:35:27.488 --> 02:35:28.168]  They torture them.
[02:35:28.208 --> 02:35:28.849]  They release them.
[02:35:28.869 --> 02:35:30.490]  They give them bombs, machine guns.
[02:35:30.990 --> 02:35:35.833]  They say, we want you to go out and plant a bomb here on this date, and you'll be well paid.
[02:35:35.993 --> 02:35:36.733]  And they do it.
[02:35:36.893 --> 02:35:38.114]  And they've been caught doing it.
[02:35:39.525 --> 02:35:59.102]  Then the average Palestinian gets sucked into bombing and killing and copycatting and blowing up themselves, and that gives Israel the pretext to helicopter gunship crowds of refugees at their markets, to rape and kill women, to broadcast pornography over Palestinian TV, to do all the things that the corrupt Israeli government does.
[02:36:01.184 --> 02:36:01.544]  Okay?
[02:36:03.246 --> 02:36:05.448]  So it's the same thing there, it's the same thing here,
[02:36:06.465 --> 02:36:09.027]  And let's say we had a peaceful march on Washington.
[02:36:09.567 --> 02:36:12.969]  I've had the leaders of the farm demonstrations on this show.
[02:36:15.251 --> 02:36:17.752]  They would drive their tractors into D.C.
[02:36:17.832 --> 02:36:19.233]  peaceably, driving down the road.
[02:36:19.333 --> 02:36:27.158]  Police, this was all on tape in the seventies, would climb up and beat them in the head with billy clubs, would beat their children, would spray them with mace.
[02:36:29.059 --> 02:36:29.659]  Attacked them!
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:33.602]  They are so afraid of good, decent Americans.
[02:36:34.508 --> 02:36:36.928]  Let's say we had 100,000 patriots in D.C.
[02:36:37.289 --> 02:36:40.629]  saying, we know you carried out 9-1-1, we know you're the terrorist.
[02:36:40.649 --> 02:36:46.130]  I guarantee you that the globalists would blow up a truck bomb or something.
[02:36:47.311 --> 02:36:49.791]  I guarantee you they would pull something like that.
[02:36:50.451 --> 02:36:59.493]  They would have one of their little mind control victims, guarantee would have just gotten out of a federal mental institution, would show up saying, I'm a patriot and start shooting a gun into the crowd.
[02:37:01.351 --> 02:37:07.276]  Where the power's at and where they don't have power is at the county and the city and the school board level.
[02:37:07.316 --> 02:37:12.701]  You can take over peaceably in a three-piece suit with the documents at your local level.
[02:37:14.643 --> 02:37:15.844]  But you have to become leaders.
[02:37:16.905 --> 02:37:18.946]  And obviously defensively defend your family.
[02:37:18.966 --> 02:37:20.268]  You have every right to do that.
[02:37:20.948 --> 02:37:22.069]  But that's down the road.
[02:37:22.429 --> 02:37:25.352]  We have to and we're trying to stop the secret arrest of citizens.
[02:37:25.652 --> 02:37:27.294]  We're trying to expose Patriot Act 2.
[02:37:28.539 --> 02:37:31.401]  And we've done such a good job of that now, they're having to admit it's for citizens.
[02:37:31.601 --> 02:37:33.082]  They're having to admit it's for all crime.
[02:37:33.422 --> 02:37:35.964]  They're having to admit that they're a pack of liars!
[02:37:38.746 --> 02:37:40.227]  So my warning to you is this.
[02:37:43.730 --> 02:37:45.651]  I mean, I have prominent people on this show.
[02:37:47.515 --> 02:37:56.581]  The heads of prominent gun organizations, the heads of prominent lawmen, prominent writers, and they talk about, yeah, you know, it's time for revolution, it's time for things to get physical.
[02:37:57.321 --> 02:37:58.622]  And I say no to that.
[02:37:59.262 --> 02:38:04.625]  That is exactly what the globalists want, that's exactly what they need, they've tried to provocateur it.
[02:38:05.186 --> 02:38:10.249]  Let me tell you folks, I've been trying to build a veteran a new house, Joe Campana, and they were going to tear down his house.
[02:38:11.928 --> 02:38:25.234]  It's black people, white people, American flags flying, local building supply companies get involved in donating materials, and undercover cops show up and try to talk about blowing stuff up.
[02:38:25.894 --> 02:38:26.835]  Trying to frame me!
[02:38:26.875 --> 02:38:27.975]  This is five years ago!
[02:38:29.136 --> 02:38:29.876]  They're criminals!
[02:38:30.636 --> 02:38:37.219]  I've been at rallies against the Fortune 500 and seen cops dressed up like anarchists trying to cause riots, and I've exposed them.
[02:38:37.599 --> 02:38:38.580]  They've had to back off.
[02:38:41.073 --> 02:38:52.759]  And all the time, militia people, they get involved, they're in a pro-land rights group, they go, oh, join this militia, they join it, it's run by a Fed, the Fed gets them to talk about, yeah, we ought to do something, yeah, we could stand up against them.
[02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:59.263]  Now all they got to get you to do is to agree to that, and you're going to be in the paper as a terrorist who planned to blow everything up.
[02:39:00.664 --> 02:39:01.364]  So stop it!
[02:39:03.476 --> 02:39:06.178]  I'm not talking about the last caller, he just said a march on Washington.
[02:39:06.639 --> 02:39:12.683]  A peaceful march on Washington by Patriots would be met with billy clubs, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, if you're lucky.
[02:39:14.385 --> 02:39:16.706]  They would love to have the Patriots in one spot.
[02:39:17.007 --> 02:39:18.628]  They'd love to pull something like that.
[02:39:21.170 --> 02:39:22.331]  You know what we're getting the job done?
[02:39:23.399 --> 02:39:32.845]  When I go on syndicated shows, when I go on local talk shows, when I point people to the Northwoods document, where the government admits they're illegitimate and admits they're a bunch of terrorists.
[02:39:33.386 --> 02:39:34.286]  Their own plan.
[02:39:37.709 --> 02:39:38.989]  That's where we're having an effect.
[02:39:39.450 --> 02:39:40.691]  That's where we have power.
[02:39:42.292 --> 02:39:51.598]  So, it is a setup in the culture to go around parroting all of this talk of violent overthrow of the government.
[02:39:54.378 --> 02:40:03.320]  Because when you get involved in that, you are later going to have an enemy combatant designation put on you and you're going to be arrested and disappear.
[02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:13.022]  Now they can still do it without you even saying it, but there's too many of us and we're too widespread and we're too legitimate now.
[02:40:14.622 --> 02:40:18.843]  And too many police and firemen and military are joining us and speaking out.
[02:40:21.463 --> 02:40:21.804]  Okay?
[02:40:22.824 --> 02:40:24.044]  So we've got to be on the record
[02:40:24.998 --> 02:40:32.464]  Not being entrapped into spouting off over a few beers at the militia compound by your federal leader.
[02:40:34.125 --> 02:40:34.966]  Who is the terrorist?
[02:40:35.366 --> 02:40:38.008]  What you do is when they do that, you report them.
[02:40:40.850 --> 02:40:42.772]  You reach in their pocket and grab their wallet out.
[02:40:42.792 --> 02:40:45.534]  You're going to find a badge in there.
[02:40:49.235 --> 02:40:50.756]  You have a rally or a protest.
[02:40:50.796 --> 02:40:52.516]  You better have four video cameras.
[02:40:52.556 --> 02:40:54.817]  They're now arresting pro-lifers at city squares.
[02:40:55.197 --> 02:40:56.318]  The cops beat them up.
[02:40:58.258 --> 02:41:01.320]  And then grab all the video cameras and one person escapes.
[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:03.780]  So the cops, you know, may have to drop the charges.
[02:41:04.501 --> 02:41:05.441]  They're criminals, folks!
[02:41:05.781 --> 02:41:10.483]  They've been practicing criminal frame-ups and entrapment so long, they think it's normal.
[02:41:11.664 --> 02:41:12.764]  It's like organized crime.
[02:41:12.784 --> 02:41:13.805]  You know, the Italian mob.
[02:41:13.845 --> 02:41:14.745]  They all live together.
[02:41:14.785 --> 02:41:15.545]  They all eat together.
[02:41:15.585 --> 02:41:16.625]  They all vacation together.
[02:41:16.946 --> 02:41:17.966]  They lift weights together.
[02:41:18.006 --> 02:41:19.406]  They go fishing together.
[02:41:19.726 --> 02:41:20.747]  They think it's normal.
[02:41:20.767 --> 02:41:21.767]  Well, it's not normal!
[02:41:23.527 --> 02:41:28.789]  And we're going to win this fight by exposing that they're a bunch of lying, drug dealing terrorists.
[02:41:29.409 --> 02:41:30.329]  They are the terrorists.
[02:41:31.030 --> 02:41:33.070]  They are so afraid of our info war.
[02:41:33.350 --> 02:41:35.351]  We're going to win it, regardless of what they do.
[02:41:36.138 --> 02:41:40.503]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:41:40.683 --> 02:41:45.109]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:41:45.269 --> 02:41:49.634]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:41:49.734 --> 02:41:51.015]  A New World Order.
[02:41:51.937 --> 02:41:53.558]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:42:06.533 --> 02:42:16.938]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:42:17.138 --> 02:42:22.501]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:42:46.762 --> 02:42:54.348]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.608 --> 02:42:57.730]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:42:57.990 --> 02:43:03.732]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.

[02:43:10.534 --> 02:43:14.435]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:43:14.475 --> 02:43:16.356]  The water level is always visible.
[02:43:16.556 --> 02:43:22.503]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.

[02:43:35.658 --> 02:43:39.322]  How many of you listening would give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[02:43:39.843 --> 02:43:40.684]  Listen up, folks.
[02:43:40.824 --> 02:43:44.208]  If you're taking vitamins in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[02:43:44.608 --> 02:43:49.994]  You see, according to the physician's desk reference, vitamins in a pill form are just 10% absorbed.
[02:43:50.335 --> 02:43:54.960]  So for every $100 you spend on vitamins, you're literally flushing $90 down the toilet.
[02:43:56.201 --> 02:44:02.444]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, and if you want to start absorbing the nutrients that you swallow, you need to take Sea Silver.
[02:44:02.884 --> 02:44:11.708]  Not only does it contain every vitamin, mineral, amino acid, and enzyme known to man, but because it's in organic liquid form, it offers a 98% absorption.
[02:44:12.028 --> 02:44:15.230]  And what that means is your body gets to keep the nutrients that you swallow.
[02:44:15.650 --> 02:44:17.611]  Try delicious tasting Sea Silver today.
[02:44:18.031 --> 02:44:20.512]  You'll feel a difference in two weeks or your money back.
[02:44:20.852 --> 02:44:21.152]  Call 1-888-887-2063.
[02:44:24.974 --> 02:44:25.494]  1-888-887-2063.
[02:44:25.674 --> 02:44:32.557]  Isn't it time you stopped flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[02:44:32.577 --> 02:44:34.158]  1-888-887-2063.
[02:44:35.738 --> 02:44:49.844]  Recapping what I was saying in the last segment, the government likes to claim that people that love freedom are violent.
[02:44:49.984 --> 02:44:53.866]  They go around, they try to get people to say stupid things,
[02:44:54.762 --> 02:44:56.263]  So they can then basically frame them.
[02:44:57.884 --> 02:45:02.088]  And what you need to do is, you need to get involved in the political process.
[02:45:02.168 --> 02:45:03.128]  You need to be focused.
[02:45:03.769 --> 02:45:06.911]  You need to understand this is a war for the hearts and minds of the people.
[02:45:08.412 --> 02:45:11.215]  The pen, the video camera, is mightier than the sword.
[02:45:12.576 --> 02:45:19.341]  You need to realize this and get out of the nest of COINTELPRO corruption.
[02:45:19.961 --> 02:45:22.323]  And I have a declaration right here on the air.
[02:45:23.143 --> 02:45:28.286]  That I am non-violent in any offensive capacity, that I will defend my family, though, under the U.S.
[02:45:28.326 --> 02:45:30.648]  Constitution and Bill of Rights from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:45:31.168 --> 02:45:32.669]  That I am non-violent offensively.
[02:45:34.050 --> 02:45:39.254]  That I have no wish to commit suicide, and I will never commit suicide, because I'd like to kill you and say you committed suicide.
[02:45:40.154 --> 02:45:45.518]  I will say on the record that this government is illegitimate and is carrying out terror attacks to blame it on their enemies.
[02:45:47.019 --> 02:45:51.962]  And I give the Northwoods Plan and a hundred other documents as the evidence to that on InfoWars.com.
[02:45:53.044 --> 02:45:57.065]  This is my declaration of re-independence against their corruption.
[02:45:58.646 --> 02:46:10.090]  So I don't want people calling my show, you know, sitting there in a macho fashion, talking, and a lot of them are provocateurs, about how they're going to do all this stuff physically.
[02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:13.931]  Just go back and take your federal paycheck and stay away from my show.
[02:46:15.652 --> 02:46:16.352]  Bottom line.
[02:46:17.893 --> 02:46:18.593]  You understand?
[02:46:19.173 --> 02:46:21.114]  I'm not going to be stupid and fall into their trap.
[02:46:21.710 --> 02:46:24.352]  They're going to do something to me that's going to be a total frame-up.
[02:46:25.673 --> 02:46:26.374]  Bottom line.
[02:46:26.894 --> 02:46:27.875]  And we're on the march.
[02:46:27.955 --> 02:46:29.396]  And we're in a fight for this country.
[02:46:29.716 --> 02:46:30.637]  And I'm not afraid.
[02:46:30.737 --> 02:46:31.818]  I'm honored to be here.
[02:46:32.338 --> 02:46:33.920]  I'm honored to be resisting these people.
[02:46:34.320 --> 02:46:36.982]  I'm honored to be freeing hearts and minds out there.
[02:46:37.862 --> 02:46:38.663]  Bob in New York.
[02:46:38.703 --> 02:46:39.103]  Go ahead.
[02:46:39.123 --> 02:46:39.984]  You're on the air, Bob.
[02:46:40.245 --> 02:46:40.805]  Hi, Alex.
[02:46:40.825 --> 02:46:41.306]  How are you?
[02:46:41.606 --> 02:46:42.046]  Pretty good.
[02:46:42.086 --> 02:46:42.467]  Go ahead.
[02:46:42.527 --> 02:46:44.149]  Good response to the last caller.
[02:46:44.349 --> 02:46:45.530]  Well, I'm not talking about him.
[02:46:45.550 --> 02:46:46.731]  I understand what he's saying.
[02:46:46.991 --> 02:46:48.673]  A rally, a protest is good.
[02:46:49.054 --> 02:46:52.417]  But I'm saying even something peaceable like that, they will provocateur.
[02:46:52.657 --> 02:46:53.198]  Absolutely.
[02:46:53.598 --> 02:46:55.280]  Hey, I'm the Freudian slip guy.
[02:46:55.480 --> 02:46:56.461]  I caught another one.
[02:46:56.481 --> 02:46:59.084]  Remember General Wesley Clark?
[02:46:59.674 --> 02:47:00.014]  Yes.
[02:47:00.214 --> 02:47:03.756]  Okay, he was on Meet the Press with Tim Russert this weekend.
[02:47:03.876 --> 02:47:04.977]  Yeah, former head of NATO.
[02:47:05.257 --> 02:47:21.245]  Okay, when Russert was pressing him about his removal, being handed his hat and coat and saying, thank you, have a nice day, he alluded to the fact that there was no communications and how the State Department and the White House and the Pentagon
[02:47:21.792 --> 02:47:25.295]  ...weren't really in line and he couldn't get a decent answer out of anyone.
[02:47:25.595 --> 02:47:26.535]  On what subject?
[02:47:26.676 --> 02:47:28.357]  But then his removal.
[02:47:28.637 --> 02:47:29.638]  Okay, go ahead, real quick.
[02:47:29.658 --> 02:47:45.269]  The Freudian slip was that he said that the Pentagon responded that they were seeking funds, and that was very important, and that they had two other major engagements, okay, major engagements to plan.
[02:47:46.829 --> 02:47:48.111]  That was all these invasions.
[02:47:48.592 --> 02:47:50.314]  I've got to let you go, man.
[02:47:50.735 --> 02:47:52.678]  I'm sorry to other callers, I don't have time to get to you.
[02:47:53.159 --> 02:47:56.364]  The news we couldn't cover is on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:47:57.964 --> 02:47:58.684]  Be up front.
[02:47:59.245 --> 02:47:59.845]  Thank you for the call.
[02:47:59.865 --> 02:48:00.525]  We'll let him go now.
[02:48:01.046 --> 02:48:03.127]  Appreciate it.
[02:48:03.347 --> 02:48:09.730]  That we're going to be up front, that we're going to be mainstream, that we're going to stand against the globalists with the facts that they're terrorists.
[02:48:09.750 --> 02:48:13.832]  We're not going to hide around in the backwoods and hang around with the moron feds.
[02:48:13.912 --> 02:48:19.115]  We're going to stand up, be strong, be bold, and expose the terrorists.
[02:48:20.498 --> 02:48:27.923]  Before I end this hour, I just want to remind you that there are some $10 Olympic gold coins left at Midas Resources.
[02:48:29.104 --> 02:48:32.826]  Need to call while they are still available at 1-888-294-6187.
[02:48:32.887 --> 02:48:33.307]  That's 888-294-6187.
[02:48:33.347 --> 02:48:33.827]  Take action.
[02:48:33.987 --> 02:48:35.028]  Get private, portable,
[02:48:49.134 --> 02:48:53.818]  And, um, get the coins, folks.
[02:48:53.838 --> 02:48:54.118]  888-294-6187.
[02:48:54.138 --> 02:48:55.959]  They won't be there for long.
[02:48:55.999 --> 02:48:59.182]  Ten dollar Olympic gold coins.
[02:49:00.503 --> 02:49:01.123]  Great deal.
[02:49:01.143 --> 02:49:03.004]  888-294-6187.
[02:49:03.545 --> 02:49:06.147]  Go to Infowars.com.
[02:49:06.207 --> 02:49:07.708]  Go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:49:08.368 --> 02:49:09.729]  And get my documentary films.
[02:49:09.849 --> 02:49:10.790]  Get them and make copies.
[02:49:10.830 --> 02:49:12.531]  And expose the terrorists!
[02:49:13.032 --> 02:49:14.573]  Expose the enemy combatants!
[02:49:15.325 --> 02:49:17.006]  Expose the provocateurs.
[02:49:17.366 --> 02:49:19.868]  The people running this government.
[02:49:20.488 --> 02:49:22.069]  They are the terrorists.
[02:49:22.449 --> 02:49:23.910]  They blow up the buildings.
[02:49:24.270 --> 02:49:25.051]  God bless you all.
[02:49:28.133 --> 02:49:30.634]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world.
[02:49:30.874 --> 02:49:31.775]  The Aeronizer.
[02:49:31.915 --> 02:49:33.836]  Air purifier is not a filter.
[02:49:34.036 --> 02:49:36.317]  And there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[02:49:36.498 --> 02:49:37.098]  The Aeronizer.
