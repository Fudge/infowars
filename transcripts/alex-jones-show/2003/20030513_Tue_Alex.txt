[00:00:03.932 --> 00:00:07.111]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:14.748 --> 00:00:15.388]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.069]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:18.990]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:20.411]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.151 --> 00:00:22.052]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:26.414]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:30.977]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:49.344 --> 00:00:52.766]  Big show lined up for you today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:54.547]  Thank you for joining me.
[00:00:54.827 --> 00:00:55.888]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:55.928 --> 00:01:01.091]  There has been a horrible bombing in Saudi Arabia.
[00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:21.075]  And of course, in the past bombings where Bin Laden supposedly carried the mountain Saudi Arabia, he was then caught working with the CIA attacking the Serbs in the late 1990s as a prelude for the Serbs striking back, being demonized, and being taken over.
[00:01:22.435 --> 00:01:24.476]  That's just the historical fact.
[00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:27.678]  The Republicans' own Senate report
[00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:29.834]  So now there's been a bombing.
[00:01:29.874 --> 00:01:31.415]  There could be 30 dead Americans.
[00:01:31.435 --> 00:01:32.976]  There could be 40 dead Americans.
[00:01:33.497 --> 00:01:34.397]  We don't know.
[00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:38.440]  There could be dead Brits, dead Australians.
[00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:43.484]  You know, the Bali bombing last year, it came out in the BBC.
[00:01:43.584 --> 00:01:57.954]  It came out in the Sydney Morning Herald that the government had ironclad prior knowledge and told the Taiwanese, who found out about it two weeks before, not to warn the Bali government.
[00:01:58.394 --> 00:02:00.955]  Not to warn the people in Bali.
[00:02:02.116 --> 00:02:10.499]  And we'll repost those on PrisonPlanet.com, those mainstream news articles around the new Saudi bombing.
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.763]  I'm sure our great webmasters at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com can also dig out the articles where the Carlisle Group
[00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:28.399]  His buddies, the Bin Laden family, rebuild our bases and buildings when they get bombed.
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.342]  Will that happen here?
[00:02:31.962 --> 00:02:37.086]  You've got these drills going around the country training you to go under federal martial law.
[00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:40.009]  That's what Top Off 2 is all about.
[00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:48.736]  The Red Alert Martial Law System training you how to respond, how to shelter in place, how to be a slave.
[00:02:50.502 --> 00:02:53.484]  And conveniently, there's a bombing right on time.
[00:02:53.684 --> 00:02:55.966]  Multiple bombings in Saudi Arabia.
[00:02:56.986 --> 00:02:58.868]  Saudi bombing deaths rise.
[00:02:58.888 --> 00:03:11.896]  The Saudi authorities say at least 29 people were killed and nearly 200 injured in what appeared to have been coordinated suicide bomb attacks against western targets in the capital of Saudi Arabia.
[00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:17.662]  And, uh, normally Al-Qaeda doesn't do suicide attacks, but I guess that's all changed.
[00:03:17.682 --> 00:03:20.643]  You know, a bunch of the hijackers were found still alive.
[00:03:20.663 --> 00:03:21.864]  We're going to go over that again today.
[00:03:22.364 --> 00:03:33.347]  Ten Americans and a number of other foreigners, including two Filipinos and an Australian, are believed to be among those who died in the attacks on foreign housing compounds and businesses late on Monday.
[00:03:33.367 --> 00:03:34.447]  Now, that's BBC.
[00:03:35.448 --> 00:03:39.769]  Got another article here, London Guardian, up to 50 dead in Saudi blast.
[00:03:40.806 --> 00:04:07.474]  and other article here saying out of Reuters over 40 Americans in the bombing 40 could be dead we don't know but we're posting these on Infowars.com on PrisonPlanet.com as we speak suicide bombers wound over 40 Americans in Riyadh suicide bombers killed several people and wounded more than 40 Americans and other nationals on Monday night
[00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:15.548]  In attacks on compounds housing Westerners in the capital of Saudi Arabia, the Saudi Minister and the U.S.
[00:04:15.608 --> 00:04:31.893]  Ambassador said, Saudi Interior Minister Prince Naif pulled a pro-government newspaper, some people had been killed, and wounded television pictures showed mangled cars, blasted buildings, and earlier scenes of emergency vehicles racing through Riyadh streets.
[00:04:33.524 --> 00:04:42.732]  Now, this could be the CIA, could be Mossad, or it really could be Palestinians that got into the country, got explosives and did this.
[00:04:42.792 --> 00:04:44.834]  There are real suicide bombers.
[00:04:45.254 --> 00:04:47.075]  There are real terror groups.
[00:04:47.116 --> 00:04:48.477]  They are few and far between.
[00:04:48.937 --> 00:04:49.958]  We don't know right now.
[00:04:49.978 --> 00:04:51.219]  We probably never will.
[00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:55.563]  We know Vladimir Putin blew up three apartment buildings to get martial law going in Russia.
[00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:56.924]  That's admitted, though.
[00:04:57.424 --> 00:05:01.328]  You know, the British have carried out almost every terror attack in the last 24 years in England.
[00:05:01.548 --> 00:05:03.209]  That's all over the mainstream British news.
[00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.752]  So, we look at who has a motive, who gets more power off this.
[00:05:07.113 --> 00:05:07.813]  The Globalist.
[00:05:07.853 --> 00:05:08.574]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.215 --> 00:05:16.361]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[00:05:17.077 --> 00:05:22.902]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.583]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:05:24.803 --> 00:05:32.069]  During typical nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.533]  Potassium Iodate can protect you and your loved ones against radioactive poisoning.
[00:05:36.733 --> 00:05:39.114]  It works by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:05:39.274 --> 00:05:43.996]  This shields the thyroid and protects it from absorbing the radioactive iodine-131.
[00:05:44.196 --> 00:05:51.099]  There is only one emergency thyroid blocker formulated for babies, children, pets and adults, and that's Medical Corps Potassium Iodate.
[00:05:51.299 --> 00:05:54.560]  Best of all, unopened bottles can be stored for up to a decade.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.241]  Order the official Medical Corps Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:08.608]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:08.728 --> 00:06:17.714]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:17.954 --> 00:06:22.698]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:22.918 --> 00:06:28.562]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:28.882 --> 00:06:40.686]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the cashless society control grid, implantable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:06:40.726 --> 00:06:41.506]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:06:41.546 --> 00:06:45.268]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:06:45.428 --> 00:06:47.929]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:06:48.149 --> 00:06:54.871]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:06:55.111 --> 00:07:00.353]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:00.373 --> 00:07:00.794]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:09.056 --> 00:07:14.441]  Are you aware that the equivalent of everything you earn from January to the middle of May was taken for taxes?
[00:07:14.762 --> 00:07:23.130]  On the average, nearly five months of every year are spent working just to pay the IRS, yet thousands of taxpayers continue to do nothing and the taxman snickers.
[00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:28.355]  You can whine and cry and do nothing, like sheep off to the slaughter, or you can take action.
[00:07:28.775 --> 00:07:29.676]  Call EPC.
[00:07:29.856 --> 00:07:33.960]  Estate Planning Consultants is a firm that excels in helping you keep more of your money.
[00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:40.665]  Because of the progressive tax code, an hour spent with a good tax strategist is far more productive than an hour of gainful employment.
[00:07:40.845 --> 00:07:43.428]  If you want to be smiling next April, start planning now.
[00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:45.790]  It will soon be too late and you'll lose again.
[00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:50.353]  For a free report on tax strategies, call Estate Planning Consultants, toll free at 888-265-6300.
[00:07:53.616 --> 00:07:54.237]  That's 888-265-6300.
[00:07:54.958 --> 00:08:01.068]  If you're okay with the IRS strapping you over a barrel a year after year, that's your business.
[00:08:01.329 --> 00:08:04.073]  If you're saying enough is enough, that's EPC's business.
[00:08:04.314 --> 00:08:04.995]  Call them at 888-265-6300.
[00:08:14.574 --> 00:08:15.215]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:16.936]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.656 --> 00:08:18.737]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:20.218]  You want answers?
[00:08:20.978 --> 00:08:21.899]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.539 --> 00:08:26.202]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.742 --> 00:08:30.845]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:39.611 --> 00:08:41.812]  Over the last 14 months,
[00:08:43.405 --> 00:08:58.934]  The NRA would not tell its five and a half million members that there was new gun control legislation being introduced that dwarfs the 1968 Gun Control Act.
[00:08:59.174 --> 00:09:12.542]  Now, due to massive pressure by their own members, due to broadcasts like this educating people, and Gun Owners of America, and Bernadine Smith, and many others getting the word out,
[00:09:13.817 --> 00:09:20.703]  They have been forced to release a legislative alert, and I can only say good job, finally.
[00:09:20.923 --> 00:09:28.069]  It says that it's not just going to be a reauthorization of the Clinton gun control, and Bush says he's going to sign it.
[00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.952]  It is new gun control.
[00:09:30.972 --> 00:09:34.274]  Well, that's how the Brady Law, that's how the assault weapons ban works.
[00:09:34.414 --> 00:09:35.555]  It goes in phases.
[00:09:35.615 --> 00:09:36.977]  We knew this all along.
[00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:42.001]  Wait until you hear the shocking details
[00:09:42.703 --> 00:09:52.870]  of massive, unprecedented, almost total gun control in America, and it's from the NRA's website.
[00:09:53.211 --> 00:09:58.034]  We're posting a link to this legislative alert on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:58.054 --> 00:10:00.876]  Now, of course, you already heard much of this here on the show.
[00:10:00.916 --> 00:10:06.020]  They even discovered more of all of their lawyers and lobbyists and people looking at the legislation.
[00:10:06.866 --> 00:10:13.447]  We have never seen such a massive armada of gun-grabbing legislation.
[00:10:14.807 --> 00:10:20.568]  And you watch, Bush is going to sign every last piece of it.
[00:10:21.348 --> 00:10:30.990]  Unless you wake up to the fact that Bush is not a conservative, not a Texan, that he is a sniveling neocon.
[00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.471]  And he's not running anything.
[00:10:33.531 --> 00:10:34.771]  He's like Bill Clinton.
[00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:36.051]  He's a puppet.
[00:10:37.037 --> 00:10:41.403]  He's got a record of big government and martial law and police state.
[00:10:43.005 --> 00:10:47.511]  He's got Ashcroft over there torturing the Bill of Rights and Constitution and it is shameful.
[00:10:47.912 --> 00:10:50.295]  And they're working with the Democrats, it's totally staged.
[00:10:51.215 --> 00:11:18.594]  Well, don't worry, you better give them all your rights, because they said there'd be more terror, and there has been, right on time with their terror drills from Chicago to Austin, Texas, oh yeah, they're doing something here, to Seattle, burning buses, police running around in outfits, camouflaged troops, training you that military and militarized police and city shutdowns equals safety.
[00:11:19.494 --> 00:11:27.578]  And under the red alert, FEMA has said you can't leave your house, you'll quote, be considered an enemy of the state.
[00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:34.161]  That was the quote by Sid Casperson, the big FEMA minion in New Jersey, just a few weeks ago.
[00:11:34.181 --> 00:11:40.304]  In the Gannett News Service, the Washington Post reported you won't be allowed to get your kids from school during a red alert.
[00:11:40.324 --> 00:11:44.046]  They'll take them to undisclosed, secret FEMA facilities.
[00:11:44.486 --> 00:11:45.106]  And guess what?
[00:11:45.226 --> 00:11:46.367]  I've got a film I made in 2000.
[00:11:48.126 --> 00:11:59.074]  Well, we have AP News articles in the film, and we have the documentation and the video of it with FEMA training to steal your kids then, long before 9-1-1.
[00:11:59.334 --> 00:12:00.555]  This is all staged.
[00:12:00.575 --> 00:12:03.878]  This is a massive setup, and we're going to be covering it here today.
[00:12:05.331 --> 00:12:07.953]  Saudi bombing deaths rise.
[00:12:08.613 --> 00:12:10.375]  No one knows how many are dead.
[00:12:10.395 --> 00:12:24.724]  The Saudi authorities say at least 29 people were killed and nearly 200 injured in what appeared to have been coordinated suicide bomb attacks against Western targets in the capital of Riyadh in the Demon Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
[00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:30.228]  And when I say Demon Kingdom, I mean, this is where the kidnapped kids are going, according to Reuters and AP.
[00:12:30.668 --> 00:12:32.669]  This is where the slave brothels are.
[00:12:32.789 --> 00:12:33.990]  I mean, it dwarfs Israel.
[00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:34.871]  It's got quite a few.
[00:12:36.072 --> 00:12:40.938]  They are the most corrupt, out-of-control idiots I've ever seen in my life.
[00:12:40.958 --> 00:12:42.320]  They're working with the globalists.
[00:12:43.422 --> 00:12:45.144]  They're big pushers of terror.
[00:12:46.285 --> 00:12:49.369]  And what did Judicial Watch say on C-SPAN?
[00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.912]  The Bushes vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[00:12:51.953 --> 00:12:52.914]  They stay at their homes.
[00:12:53.553 --> 00:13:05.242]  Ten Americans and a number of other foreigners, including two Filipinos and an Australian, are believed to be among those who died in the attacks on foreign housing compounds and businesses late on Monday.
[00:13:06.223 --> 00:13:09.065]  Nine suspected bombers were also killed.
[00:13:09.085 --> 00:13:22.795]  The Saudi Interior Minister said the attackers, believed to be members of Al-Qaeda, drove cars packed with explosives at four targets and at least east of the city, detonating them next to buildings with devastating effect.
[00:13:23.467 --> 00:13:26.668]  And there's all the images of the carnage and the smoking husk of buildings.
[00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:29.209]  Right on time!
[00:13:29.229 --> 00:13:32.509]  And who always gets the contracts to fix these buildings for U.S.
[00:13:32.529 --> 00:13:33.750]  housing and over there?
[00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.370]  Why, the Bin Laden family!
[00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.391]  But, oh, we're not supposed to talk about that!
[00:13:39.411 --> 00:13:49.214]  And, uh, yes, what did Israel do in 73 according to UPI, Reuters, and AP, and Haratz out of Jerusalem, the Jewish newspaper,
[00:13:50.174 --> 00:13:56.399]  And according to the words of Yishak Rabin before he was gunned down by Mossad, what do we know?
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.801]  What do we understand here?
[00:14:00.522 --> 00:14:10.670]  That they carry these out, that they find the young idiots that will carry out the bombings, just like the FBI did with the first World Trade Center attack, putting the bomb, praying the drivers, letting it go forward.
[00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:14.733]  They find the fools to do this, and the globalists stand to gain.
[00:14:15.874 --> 00:14:19.637]  It legitimizes the invasion, the attack on the Middle East.
[00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:24.440]  The takeover of the oil and the military control of the weapons sales.
[00:14:26.642 --> 00:14:34.629]  The Saudi ambassador in London, Turkey Al-Faisal, said some of the attackers were members of the fugitive group
[00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:42.498]  Of 19 suspected Al-Qaeda sympathizers, it's always 19, who had disappeared from a yacht on the 6th of May.
[00:14:42.618 --> 00:14:42.778]  U.S.
[00:14:42.818 --> 00:14:51.462]  Secretary of State Colin Powell, who arrived in Saudi Arabia only hours after the attack, said the cowardly operation were all the signs of Osama Bin Laden's network.
[00:14:52.863 --> 00:14:54.123]  Now folks, let's get it straight.
[00:14:54.824 --> 00:14:56.905]  It's horrible that we have suicide bombers.
[00:14:57.005 --> 00:14:57.985]  It's disgusting.
[00:14:58.746 --> 00:14:59.526]  It's wrong.
[00:14:59.626 --> 00:15:01.387]  It only empowers the globalists.
[00:15:02.367 --> 00:15:10.992]  But, this comment about someone blowing themself up being cowardly, you know, that's pretty ridiculous, folks.
[00:15:11.092 --> 00:15:14.694]  Do they call it cowardly when the Marine jumps on the hand grenade?
[00:15:15.554 --> 00:15:15.915]  No!
[00:15:16.935 --> 00:15:19.897]  So, let's just recognize propaganda when we see it.
[00:15:21.678 --> 00:15:24.299]  These are mind control, cultural mind control.
[00:15:24.339 --> 00:15:25.820]  You go, what's cultural mind control?
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.782]  Well, they had cultural mind control in Japan.
[00:15:29.457 --> 00:15:41.642]  Defend the Emperor, defend the Sun God, get on your little aircraft, you barely know how to fly, and go into a bunch of AAA fire and crash into the deck of an aircraft carrier.
[00:15:42.283 --> 00:15:45.984]  No drugs, no torture, peer pressure used to get it done.
[00:15:47.825 --> 00:15:52.147]  That's a subtler form and even more powerful than most of the drug-induced types of mind control.
[00:15:53.567 --> 00:15:56.108]  Now, our government does use the chemical mind control.
[00:15:56.128 --> 00:15:57.249]  There's Senate reports on it.
[00:15:58.078 --> 00:16:10.280]  And anybody that doubts me on this, remember two, three weeks ago they caught the guy who had the five women he kidnapped and he would release them after months of torture and rape and they would come back to him and they would never tell on him?
[00:16:11.461 --> 00:16:12.641]  That was mind control.
[00:16:13.161 --> 00:16:14.141]  One guy did that.
[00:16:14.721 --> 00:16:16.042]  Think of what the government can do.
[00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:18.922]  We have confirmed cases of it.
[00:16:19.442 --> 00:16:23.423]  But in this case, it's cultural mind control.
[00:16:24.838 --> 00:16:27.039]  If these weren't even remote-controlled vehicles, we don't know.
[00:16:27.099 --> 00:16:27.819]  We'll never know.
[00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:30.060]  We just know that we have a U.S.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:38.384]  government document called the Northwoods Plan, Baltimore Sun, ABC News, but forget them!
[00:16:38.904 --> 00:16:45.766]  Link at Infowars.com to the National Security Archives at the Library of Congress.
[00:16:46.307 --> 00:16:47.727]  Read it for yourself.
[00:16:47.787 --> 00:16:48.247]  It's only 16 pages.
[00:16:50.891 --> 00:16:51.632]  Where the U.S.
[00:16:51.672 --> 00:17:03.299]  government calls for hijacking jet airliners, bombing Washington, D.C., killing Marines using Army dressed up as Cubans as a pretext for World War III.
[00:17:05.862 --> 00:17:16.329]  You compound this with the Germans founding the modern neo-Nazi groups in Germany, having them carry out killings, and trying to crack down on free speech and political parties in Germany.
[00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:28.858]  They had to throw it out of court last month when it came out in the BBC, all over the German papers and British papers, that the top 30 leaders were all GSGQ, all German intelligence.
[00:17:29.018 --> 00:17:33.762]  They don't control or manipulate them, they found them, they run them, they are them.
[00:17:34.322 --> 00:17:35.363]  The British intel.
[00:17:36.474 --> 00:17:38.555]  They're top operative in the IRA.
[00:17:38.615 --> 00:17:43.358]  Now it turns out named Steak Knife was a top MI6 agent.
[00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:46.560]  Slash Army Intel and a high-level secret group.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.501]  We covered that yesterday.
[00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:54.725]  Over and over and over and over again, look at the motive.
[00:17:55.205 --> 00:17:58.027]  Who stands to gain from all of this?
[00:17:58.067 --> 00:17:59.248]  Then you look at the evidence.
[00:18:00.097 --> 00:18:08.260]  The First World Trade Center, Oklahoma City, 9-1-1, it becomes absolutely evident what we're dealing with, what we're facing.
[00:18:09.681 --> 00:18:25.867]  You know, if the government was leaving our liberties alone, leaving our guns alone, leaving our freedoms alone, controlling our borders, and they said, let's invade Iraq because they're bad, let's invade Syria, Iran, I could say, well that violates what George Washington said, but you know what, you can't really argue with it too much.
[00:18:26.804 --> 00:18:29.146]  If they were really bringing freedom and all this, but they're not.
[00:18:29.166 --> 00:18:30.487]  They're mowing down protesters.
[00:18:30.507 --> 00:18:32.388]  They're giving them $20 a month to live on.
[00:18:32.868 --> 00:18:34.109]  They're totally enslaving them.
[00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:35.330]  They're grabbing all the oil.
[00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.251]  They're enslaving us here domestically.
[00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:42.615]  They got gun bills that dwarf all gun control ever seen that Bush says he's gonna sign.
[00:18:44.696 --> 00:18:46.197]  They're arming all of our enemies.
[00:18:47.358 --> 00:18:49.179]  They're destabilizing our world.
[00:18:49.219 --> 00:18:53.662]  They're running martial law drills, known as Top Off, all over the country.
[00:18:54.577 --> 00:18:56.838]  They're putting up face scanning cameras everywhere.
[00:18:56.878 --> 00:18:58.339]  They're militarizing the police.
[00:18:58.659 --> 00:19:00.460]  Trading them to hate the American people.
[00:19:01.121 --> 00:19:02.581]  They're shipping in the narcotics.
[00:19:03.382 --> 00:19:06.703]  The shadow government, owned by the private banks, is out of control.
[00:19:06.944 --> 00:19:11.006]  They've gotten delusional, like Caligula, and Nero, and all the rest of them!
[00:19:13.387 --> 00:19:16.949]  And we have got to stand up, and say no to these people!
[00:19:17.329 --> 00:19:18.770]  And have some basic courage!
[00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:27.415]  Because let me tell you, if you really knew what their plan was, and you really studied them, you'd know it would take more courage, blind, dumb courage, to not fight these people.
[00:19:29.196 --> 00:19:42.124]  If you love your family, if you love your country, if you've got any shred of decency and understanding, get past the peer pressure, get past the cultural mind control, get past your programming, wake up out of the matrix, and face what we're dealing with.
[00:19:45.228 --> 00:19:47.570]  We'll be right back and I'll get into the NRA.
[00:19:48.111 --> 00:19:50.613]  Finally admitting the ultra gun grabbing is going on.
[00:19:50.653 --> 00:19:51.554]  More on the bombings.
[00:19:51.614 --> 00:19:54.757]  More on the terror drills that coincide with the bombings.
[00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:56.498]  See?
[00:19:56.598 --> 00:19:57.879]  Final control is needed.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:01.823]  See what happens when you don't become our slaves?
[00:20:02.423 --> 00:20:04.806]  The Batman come and he boom boom you.
[00:20:06.127 --> 00:20:07.708]  Operation Northwoods.
[00:20:07.768 --> 00:20:08.529]  We'll be back.
[00:20:10.436 --> 00:20:14.037]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:20:14.277 --> 00:20:15.697]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:20:16.177 --> 00:20:17.598]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:20:17.878 --> 00:20:23.039]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:20:23.419 --> 00:20:27.880]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:36.842]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:20:37.362 --> 00:20:38.482]  Gum disease is serious.
[00:20:38.962 --> 00:20:42.723]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[00:20:43.003 --> 00:20:49.625]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[00:20:49.965 --> 00:20:54.006]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[00:21:09.708 --> 00:21:18.331]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:21:18.551 --> 00:21:29.815]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:21:30.035 --> 00:21:32.696]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:33.036 --> 00:21:37.138]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:21:37.338 --> 00:21:39.480]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.522]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:21:41.723 --> 00:21:47.749]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:21:47.989 --> 00:21:53.655]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:21:58.662 --> 00:21:59.363]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:09.753 --> 00:22:12.374]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:22:12.614 --> 00:22:18.357]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:22:18.597 --> 00:22:19.978]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:22:20.078 --> 00:22:23.760]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:30.003]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[00:22:30.143 --> 00:22:32.624]  The two most important protein superfoods known.
[00:22:32.944 --> 00:22:42.597]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water, normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[00:22:42.897 --> 00:22:47.123]  It's also very hydrating, and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[00:22:47.623 --> 00:22:51.288]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease,
[00:22:51.288 --> 00:22:51.448]  Gold.
[00:23:10.128 --> 00:23:11.328]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:23:11.608 --> 00:23:17.690]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.690]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:23:22.051 --> 00:23:23.931]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:23:23.991 --> 00:23:26.291]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:23:26.431 --> 00:23:33.933]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:23:34.053 --> 00:23:34.794]  I don't know.
[00:23:50.777 --> 00:23:51.477]  We're good.
[00:24:33.722 --> 00:24:35.403]  Think of how America's changed.
[00:24:35.463 --> 00:24:38.845]  They get on the nightly news and say, torture's good.
[00:24:39.866 --> 00:24:42.847]  Let's go ahead and torture terrorist suspects' children.
[00:24:43.328 --> 00:24:45.909]  And then out of the other side of their mouth, they say, Saddam's bad.
[00:24:45.949 --> 00:24:46.670]  He tortures.
[00:24:47.170 --> 00:24:47.910]  Saddam is bad.
[00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:49.091]  He was trained by the globalists.
[00:24:49.631 --> 00:24:50.572]  A hit man for him in 58.
[00:24:50.792 --> 00:24:52.353]  They sold him all the weapons.
[00:24:53.674 --> 00:24:54.915]  Put him in power in the late 70s.
[00:24:56.835 --> 00:24:59.638]  Finance team for his invasions and attacks on his neighbors.
[00:25:00.418 --> 00:25:12.709]  And now they're in there setting up an even worse police state, putting the Ba'ath Party back in control, paying the Iraqi people that worked for them for the oil companies and the military $20 a month, a nation of 19 million slaves.
[00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:14.671]  I didn't know they'd go that far.
[00:25:15.794 --> 00:25:24.822]  Yeah, the oil, the weapons sales, the domestic police state smokescreen, the economy imploding, the dollar plunging, but that's okay.
[00:25:24.862 --> 00:25:33.871]  The yuppies think if they just support the government in all its policies, their way of life will be protected when that's the complete opposite of what's happening.
[00:25:35.732 --> 00:25:37.214]  And finally, the NRA.
[00:25:37.654 --> 00:25:39.356]  For 14 months, we have
[00:25:40.271 --> 00:25:53.074]  Known of the new gun bills for 14 months, we found out they plan to tag more stuff on the reauthorization of the assault weapons that semi-auto ban and magazine ban.
[00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.351]  And I told you this three years ago during the election.
[00:25:57.391 --> 00:26:01.272]  I said, hey, Bush is giving speeches saying he's going to reauthorize this.
[00:26:01.572 --> 00:26:02.573]  No, he's not.
[00:26:02.633 --> 00:26:04.393]  He's a good conservative.
[00:26:04.833 --> 00:26:07.394]  Well, he stands around at a ranch.
[00:26:07.934 --> 00:26:10.515]  You know nothing about ranching, Mr. Jones.
[00:26:10.675 --> 00:26:11.075]  Oh, no.
[00:26:11.135 --> 00:26:14.016]  My family's just been doing it since 1830 here in Texas.
[00:26:15.237 --> 00:26:19.898]  Anybody who stands around in front of hay bales ain't about to take my guns, boy.
[00:26:20.518 --> 00:26:21.899]  I said, all righty, partner.
[00:26:22.731 --> 00:26:25.974]  Let me switch into my Kenny Buckport accent.
[00:26:26.974 --> 00:26:31.078]  Yes, we've been serving the crown since before the war on the side of the Tories.
[00:26:31.518 --> 00:26:33.240]  Once a Tory, always a Tory.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:38.904]  Let me get back into my fake Texas voice here for you, partner.
[00:26:40.485 --> 00:26:41.726]  Makes me want to puke.
[00:26:43.428 --> 00:26:44.609]  And so we went over this.
[00:26:44.629 --> 00:26:47.471]  You're like, well, if you don't like Bush, what about Al Gore?
[00:26:47.571 --> 00:26:49.613]  You know, I actually during the election said, look,
[00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:52.971]  I'm not going to be for Al Gore or George Bush, folks.
[00:26:53.071 --> 00:26:56.251]  I'm not even voting when it comes to the presidential box.
[00:26:57.212 --> 00:26:58.612]  These are all staged.
[00:26:58.832 --> 00:27:00.452]  All these candidates are staged.
[00:27:01.253 --> 00:27:03.073]  Give me a break.
[00:27:04.433 --> 00:27:08.314]  And they had that whole election thing that was like sudden death overtime in the Super Bowl.
[00:27:08.934 --> 00:27:11.275]  Got y'all rooting for your team even more.
[00:27:11.455 --> 00:27:12.575]  It's staged!
[00:27:13.175 --> 00:27:15.116]  At the presidential level, it's staged.
[00:27:15.136 --> 00:27:16.676]  They're all on the same team.
[00:27:17.136 --> 00:27:17.796]  They meet.
[00:27:18.297 --> 00:27:19.737]  It is pure theater.
[00:27:20.945 --> 00:27:21.826]  That is proven.
[00:27:22.567 --> 00:27:23.188]  Bush Sr.
[00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:25.231]  and Clinton met 11 times before the election.
[00:27:25.632 --> 00:27:26.974]  Business partners at MENA.
[00:27:27.514 --> 00:27:31.160]  Totally and completely staged.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.222]  And so, I sat here and I said,
[00:27:34.804 --> 00:27:36.946]  If Bush will leave our guns alone, fine.
[00:27:37.286 --> 00:27:46.613]  The guy comes into office, starts saying it, supercomputers in China, blocks Dan Burton's committee, going after Clinton on Pardongate, opens the borders up, I start freaking out.
[00:27:47.293 --> 00:27:50.436]  Then, and I was still like, well, you know, Bush is all right.
[00:27:50.456 --> 00:27:51.917]  People were like, well, he's sculling bones.
[00:27:51.957 --> 00:27:52.917]  Well, I guess he is.
[00:27:54.198 --> 00:27:57.801]  And then 9-1-1 came, and my goodness, are we in trouble.
[00:28:00.598 --> 00:28:08.780]  My goodness are we in trouble and uh... I told you it's not just reauthorization of the assault weapons ban, it's all these other gun bills.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:17.442]  National registration, shut down the gun shows, national ballistics database, and the NRA, I get their magazine.
[00:28:18.502 --> 00:28:29.325]  Oh yes, I've been a member years ago and I still get the magazine, I still do it for intel purposes, and there's nothing in there about it until lately because we told you, the listeners,
[00:28:30.029 --> 00:28:30.749]  On all of our A.M.
[00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:31.010]  and F.M.
[00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:43.256]  affiliates for the Internet to call the NRA and say, I'm dumping my endowment, I'm taking you out of my will, I'm dropping my lifetime membership, I'm going to speak out against you if you do not tell people about these gun bills.
[00:28:45.177 --> 00:28:51.180]  So they're acting like they're against it now, but you watch, they're going to give more money than ever to Lord Bush in the next election.
[00:28:53.121 --> 00:28:55.983]  As we predicted, now this is the NRA finally
[00:28:56.727 --> 00:29:02.010]  In their legislative update section, finally reporting on the truth.
[00:29:02.890 --> 00:29:03.670]  We commend them.
[00:29:05.051 --> 00:29:07.192]  Most sweeping gun ban ever hits Congress.
[00:29:07.252 --> 00:29:08.253]  Clinton ban.
[00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:11.754]  Reenactment targets millions more guns.
[00:29:13.415 --> 00:29:16.517]  Well that's almost the same headline as six months ago from gun owners.
[00:29:17.037 --> 00:29:18.898]  New gun laws target millions more gun owners.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:24.302]  As we predicted, the anti-gunners have begun to push to further expand the Clinton Gun Ban of 94.
[00:29:24.882 --> 00:29:33.446]  Not content with merely reauthorizing the ban, Representative John Conyers and Carolyn McCarthy have drafted legislation to ban millions more guns.
[00:29:33.786 --> 00:29:35.127]  Oh, and Bush is going to vote for them.
[00:29:35.987 --> 00:29:36.708]  We'll be back.
[00:29:37.608 --> 00:29:39.309]  We'll tell you the rest of the story.
[00:29:39.449 --> 00:29:43.611]  Get more into the bombing and get your take on that tragedy in Saudi Arabia.
[00:29:43.971 --> 00:29:48.073]  Coincide with the FEMA drills training you to accept tyranny and martial law.
[00:29:49.171 --> 00:29:51.713]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number.
[00:29:51.733 --> 00:29:52.513]  Join us.
[00:29:53.213 --> 00:29:54.074]  InfoWars.gov.
[00:29:54.654 --> 00:29:55.755]  We're on the march.
[00:29:55.795 --> 00:29:56.696]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.716 --> 00:29:59.457]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.405 --> 00:30:14.748]  I have tried many other diets to lose weight and I have not been successful.
[00:30:14.868 --> 00:30:19.811]  Here's more that have lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:20.011 --> 00:30:23.013]  With Vim and Vigor.
[00:30:23.033 --> 00:30:26.855]  1-888-887-2063 Isn't it time you stopped flushing your vitamins down the toilet?
[00:30:26.875 --> 00:30:26.935]  1-888-887-2063
[00:30:31.525 --> 00:30:32.146]  I don't know.
[00:30:54.398 --> 00:30:58.741]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here, back live.
[00:30:59.021 --> 00:31:01.042]  I love liberty, I love America.
[00:31:01.102 --> 00:31:04.784]  They're setting up textbook tyranny here in the United States.
[00:31:04.824 --> 00:31:08.867]  Call it communism, call it fascism, those are all just names to confuse you.
[00:31:08.927 --> 00:31:10.608]  It's all command and control.
[00:31:11.528 --> 00:31:14.530]  And recapping, and I'll get into this NRA analysis,
[00:31:16.218 --> 00:31:24.805]  I watched with horror as Governor Bush said he would reauthorize the Clinton gun ban, because I knew the Clinton gun ban was to be set in phases.
[00:31:25.826 --> 00:31:30.390]  California's implemented it, Massachusetts has, Chicago has.
[00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:40.037]  It starts by saying you can't import, you can't manufacture, then you can't have the magazines, you can't have the guns, you can't have the ammo.
[00:31:40.538 --> 00:31:41.899]  It's happened in California.
[00:31:43.061 --> 00:31:47.370]  We've aired the TV and radio ads here where they say, turn your guns in.
[00:31:47.851 --> 00:31:49.795]  Time's running out, out in California.
[00:31:50.537 --> 00:31:51.780]  This is the new America.
[00:31:53.371 --> 00:31:58.894]  And so, see, I'm about substance, actually being what you would call a conservative.
[00:31:59.075 --> 00:32:02.937]  I'm really a constitutionalist, but to use the political spectrum we have, I'm a constitutionalist.
[00:32:03.397 --> 00:32:05.418]  The neocons on talk radio are not.
[00:32:05.518 --> 00:32:06.359]  They are liars.
[00:32:06.399 --> 00:32:21.168]  They are there to make fun of the liberals, to have stupid liberal callers up to make them look dumb, because they are dumb, they are useful idiots, and to act like, oh, they're opposing all these socialists, oh, these stupid land grabbers, these dumb environmentalist wackos.
[00:32:21.812 --> 00:32:23.934]  Well, the leadership of these groups aren't wackos.
[00:32:23.954 --> 00:32:25.175]  They're big government pimps.
[00:32:25.655 --> 00:32:26.696]  They know what they're doing.
[00:32:27.937 --> 00:32:32.581]  Then the neocons are just a different flavor, a different branch of the same tyranny.
[00:32:32.901 --> 00:32:37.405]  And on key issues, they vote identically with Tom Daschle and Chuckie Schumer.
[00:32:37.705 --> 00:32:38.406]  So here it is.
[00:32:38.926 --> 00:32:46.853]  Finally, the NRA, over a year after we demanded it, week after week, has told you some of the horror.
[00:32:48.337 --> 00:32:56.326]  And it's at NRA Legislative Update Center and it's being posted on Infowars.com right now.
[00:32:57.127 --> 00:32:59.130]  As we predicted, listen to the NRA.
[00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:00.271]  As you predicted?
[00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:01.833]  You didn't predict anything.
[00:33:02.193 --> 00:33:06.318]  The anti-gunners have begun to push to further expand the Clinton Gun Ban 94.
[00:33:06.398 --> 00:33:07.920]  Well, let's call it the Bush Gun Ban.
[00:33:08.704 --> 00:33:18.374]  Not content with merely reauthorizing the ban, Representative John Conyers and Carolyn McCarthy, Congress folks, have drafted legislation that bans millions more guns.
[00:33:18.474 --> 00:33:31.868]  It's a giant step closer to the goal stated by Clinton ban sponsor, Senator Dianne Feinstein, who said on CBS 60 Minutes, if I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate, the United States for an outright ban, picking up
[00:33:33.018 --> 00:33:36.141]  Every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America turned them all in.
[00:33:36.321 --> 00:33:37.222]  I would have done it.
[00:33:37.663 --> 00:33:40.726]  Towards that goal, Conyers McCarthy would.
[00:33:40.746 --> 00:33:51.697]  And of course, I have Sarah Brady in my book from a major mainstream publication, The National Educator, on the floor of the Senate.
[00:33:52.427 --> 00:34:03.930]  Many years ago, said our tasks of creating a socialist America can only succeed when those who would resist us have been totally disarmed.
[00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:14.373]  On the Senate floor, Sarah Brady speaking to Chairman of Handgun Control Incorporated to Senator Howard Metzenbaum, reported in the National Educator, January 94, Issue Page 3.
[00:34:19.737 --> 00:34:24.342]  And, uh, Barbara Boxer wanted to arm all the pilots last year.
[00:34:24.502 --> 00:34:30.508]  Lord Bush, neocon that he is, said, no, we're not arming any of them!
[00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:38.357]  And there was a massive backlash, so he said, okay, if you can jump through several hundred flaming hoops, you can be armed.
[00:34:38.977 --> 00:34:39.458]  The pilots.
[00:34:41.221 --> 00:34:42.342]  And here's what they do now.
[00:34:42.382 --> 00:34:44.462]  And this is a whitewash by the NRA, but it's bad enough.
[00:34:44.903 --> 00:34:47.664]  Ban every gun made to lawfully comply with the Clinton ban.
[00:34:47.684 --> 00:34:48.824]  Hmm, that's nice.
[00:34:48.884 --> 00:34:50.885]  Ban every gun made to lawfully comply with the Clinton ban.
[00:34:51.585 --> 00:34:57.748]  The Clinton ban arbitrarily dictated the kinds of grips, stocks, attachments the new guns could have.
[00:34:58.168 --> 00:34:59.529]  Manufacturers complied.
[00:34:59.969 --> 00:35:01.950]  New guns were made to conform to the Clinton restrictions.
[00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.891]  Now prohibitionists want to ban the new guns, too.
[00:35:05.551 --> 00:35:06.111]  Ban guns.
[00:35:06.131 --> 00:35:07.192]  The Clinton legislation
[00:35:08.181 --> 00:35:26.169]  Expressly exempted from prohibition, this includes Ruger Mini-14s, Ranch Rifles, great little coyote gun, and we're out in the back of the truck, the .30 caliber carbine rifles, and entire classes of guns, including fixed magazine rifles, as well as shotguns that hold under five rounds.
[00:35:26.889 --> 00:35:27.390]  You heard it!
[00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:28.950]  Shotguns!
[00:35:29.991 --> 00:35:31.571]  The actual ban says three rounds.
[00:35:31.591 --> 00:35:32.752]  No more!
[00:35:33.701 --> 00:35:35.702]  Now you'll have the BATF dragging you out.
[00:35:35.762 --> 00:35:37.123]  You're a veteran, never did anything.
[00:35:37.143 --> 00:35:39.744]  Got a few quail and duck guns.
[00:35:42.645 --> 00:35:44.986]  By the way, they want to ban 10-gauge shotguns.
[00:35:45.126 --> 00:35:46.207]  Want to tell you about that.
[00:35:46.247 --> 00:35:49.228]  How many of you need that 10-gauge to get those half-lying ducks?
[00:35:49.248 --> 00:35:52.349]  Of course, it isn't about hunting, but you always thought it was.
[00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.430]  And so you thought you'd be safe.
[00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:55.791]  Well, ha ha!
[00:35:56.091 --> 00:35:57.652]  You're going to learn, aren't you boy?
[00:35:58.559 --> 00:36:00.641]  Banned guns widely used for target shooting.
[00:36:01.121 --> 00:36:05.585]  It bans the three centerfire rifles most commonly used for marksmanship competitions.
[00:36:05.645 --> 00:36:09.548]  The Colt AR-15, the Springfield M1A, and the M1 Grand.
[00:36:10.048 --> 00:36:11.089]  It bans them!
[00:36:11.129 --> 00:36:13.211]  This is from the NRA website.
[00:36:13.251 --> 00:36:14.612]  Let me tell you, it's much worse than this.
[00:36:15.948 --> 00:36:21.993]  Ban all semi-automatic shotguns, Remingtons, Winchesters, Bennellys, Berettas, etc.
[00:36:22.013 --> 00:36:28.318]  Widely used for hunting, traps, skeet, and sporting clays by banning their receivers, the main component.
[00:36:28.858 --> 00:36:31.721]  By the way, these shotguns are mainly used for home defense.
[00:36:31.901 --> 00:36:33.442]  Why don't you say that, NRA?
[00:36:34.022 --> 00:36:35.584]  Got one sitting right next to me.
[00:36:37.025 --> 00:36:37.885]  Oh yeah.
[00:36:37.966 --> 00:36:39.447]  Ban guns for defense.
[00:36:40.129 --> 00:36:42.591]  Ban any semi-automatic rifle or shotgun.
[00:36:42.631 --> 00:36:43.211]  Any U.S.
[00:36:43.791 --> 00:36:46.513]  Attorney General one day claims it's not sporting.
[00:36:46.833 --> 00:36:48.495]  Oh see, now it's only for sporting.
[00:36:48.535 --> 00:36:50.856]  See, the NRA agrees with that definition.
[00:36:51.076 --> 00:36:52.517]  This is your right for sporting.
[00:36:52.537 --> 00:36:54.859]  See how they're helping set the definition as a U.N.
[00:36:54.899 --> 00:36:55.119]  member.
[00:36:56.295 --> 00:37:03.879]  Even though self-defense is a fundamental right, the federal constitution, the constitution of 44 states, the laws of all 50 states recognize the right to use guns for defense.
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:21.469]  Ban 68 named guns, Clinton gun ban named 19, ban parts used to repair and refurbish guns, including firearms, and by the way, the BATF can all arbitrarily enforce this, raid gun dealers, raid gunsmiths, a lot of former cops are getting arrested, a lot of military people.
[00:37:22.009 --> 00:37:23.752]  They come in, please fix my shotgun.
[00:37:23.792 --> 00:37:25.574]  They arrest you in the states where they have these laws.
[00:37:26.035 --> 00:37:28.238]  Ban importation of ammunition, magazines.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.621]  Exempt from the gun ban.
[00:37:30.661 --> 00:37:35.227]  Ban private sales of millions of guns, their frames and receivers and their parts.
[00:37:35.788 --> 00:37:37.671]  Ban semi-automatic rifles under 30 inch long.
[00:37:39.148 --> 00:37:40.228]  Useful for home defense.
[00:37:40.288 --> 00:37:43.589]  Ban all semi-automatic rifles that can hold more than 10 rounds.
[00:37:43.989 --> 00:37:45.870]  Ban guns rarely used in crime.
[00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:56.033]  State and local law enforcement agencies reports have always shown that guns on the Clinton and Conyers McCarthy ban list have never been used in more than a small percentage of violent crime.
[00:37:58.428 --> 00:38:14.787]  Congressionally mandated study of the Clinton Law concluded that guns that it banned were never used in more than a fraction of all gun murders, but even if they were, the guns are rights and liberties of law-abiding citizens to be directed by the act of criminals.
[00:38:16.128 --> 00:38:17.690]  To be dictated by the acts of criminals.
[00:38:18.564 --> 00:38:29.074]  Again, backdoor registration requires manufacturers of banned guns, frames, receivers, and parts to report the names of their dealers and require dealers to report any of those parts they haven't stocked.
[00:38:29.375 --> 00:38:32.778]  The next step is obviously demanding the names of gun owners who buy those parts.
[00:38:34.319 --> 00:38:35.741]  And, uh, this is the NRA.
[00:38:36.869 --> 00:38:41.170]  Now, what the NRA will not discuss, for some reason, is S-22.
[00:38:41.290 --> 00:39:03.337]  Patriot Act II is the general bill, and then S-22 is our Lady of Peace Act, passed by the Republican House last year, now reintroduced in the new Congress, it's in the Senate, registers all gun owners, specifically what you get at the point of sale, registers all guns ballistically, a whole new layer of bureaucracy, registration, and fees,
[00:39:05.558 --> 00:39:11.440]  It also shuts down the gun shows and bans the private sale of you selling a rifle to your neighbor if two or more people are there.
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.461]  Lots of stings already happening in states that have that for your neighbor.
[00:39:15.581 --> 00:39:25.344]  They'll actually move a guy into a neighborhood having to push his neighbors to sell shotguns or rifles to them and then bust them.
[00:39:25.384 --> 00:39:33.127]  There's eight provisions in S-22 and by the way it's the Patriot Act introduced six months ago
[00:39:35.130 --> 00:39:40.954]  Secret arrest everything with lots of luscious gun control for you and Bush says he'll sign it if they pass it.
[00:39:42.274 --> 00:39:46.037]  Now, that's real conservative, isn't it?
[00:39:47.738 --> 00:39:50.619]  Now, maybe you'll listen to the NRA, okay?
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.241]  Maybe, just maybe.
[00:39:54.822 --> 00:40:01.606]  So now the fight's going to be on keeping all of this out, not removing and
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.321]  Getting rid of the previous law.
[00:40:05.421 --> 00:40:07.121]  You must demand Lord Bush.
[00:40:07.161 --> 00:40:08.442]  You must tell Lord Bush.
[00:40:08.982 --> 00:40:10.543]  You don't care if Al Gore wins.
[00:40:10.583 --> 00:40:14.544]  You don't care if his Skull and Bones alumni member John Kerry wins.
[00:40:14.624 --> 00:40:15.845]  It won't matter anyways.
[00:40:15.865 --> 00:40:17.385]  It's all the same agenda.
[00:40:17.966 --> 00:40:19.686]  You're going to vote for a Libertarian.
[00:40:20.166 --> 00:40:22.047]  You're going to vote for a Constitutional Party.
[00:40:22.487 --> 00:40:24.788]  You're going to vote for natural law.
[00:40:24.828 --> 00:40:27.109]  You're going to vote for somebody else.
[00:40:27.529 --> 00:40:30.510]  You'd do better voting for the Socialistic Greens.
[00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:32.511]  Because we know what we had.
[00:40:33.248 --> 00:40:38.709]  We know we were dealing with it, with galvanized and energized grassroots patriots to fight them.
[00:40:40.170 --> 00:40:41.330]  Then voting for Bush.
[00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:47.091]  I'll tell you right now, you call the Lord Bush, you call him, and you tell him.
[00:40:47.991 --> 00:40:53.152]  You tell him, we know you're a puppet, we know you're like Bill Clinton, we know you just follow orders and read off teleprompters.
[00:40:53.212 --> 00:40:55.173]  I mean, what president wouldn't just do that?
[00:40:55.193 --> 00:40:58.534]  They're so busy, they're just giving their scripts daily on their itinerary.
[00:40:58.554 --> 00:41:00.574]  It's just a fact, they're all puppets, folks.
[00:41:01.258 --> 00:41:07.580]  Tell his focus groups, all of them, that you are NOT, NOT going to do this.
[00:41:08.621 --> 00:41:10.701]  Stronger gun laws than we have in Iraq, folks.
[00:41:13.082 --> 00:41:14.803]  So, and call the NRA.
[00:41:14.843 --> 00:41:21.665]  Tell them if they don't expose S-22 and the fact that the Patriot Act's been introduced in the Senate with gun control, you're gonna drop your membership.
[00:41:21.845 --> 00:41:28.107]  Demand they go all the way if they'll just tell their five and a half million members.
[00:41:28.187 --> 00:41:29.628]  Now understand, there are 130 million gun owners.
[00:41:31.428 --> 00:41:33.789]  A hundred million of them go out and shoot more than once a year.
[00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:37.051]  If a hundred million were active, we'd have our second amendment back.
[00:41:37.411 --> 00:41:45.016]  But they think, oh, I got the NRA, and the five and a half million that are somewhat active have been totally co-opted, and it's a sick joke.
[00:41:46.917 --> 00:41:48.658]  So, what do you think about this?
[00:41:48.678 --> 00:41:50.939]  I mean, how conservative is Lord Bush?
[00:41:50.959 --> 00:41:52.179]  Well, he's not conservative.
[00:41:52.219 --> 00:41:53.100]  He's not liberal.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.021]  He's a control minion.
[00:41:56.402 --> 00:41:58.483]  He's a command and a controller.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.422]  What do you think about this?
[00:42:01.442 --> 00:42:03.724]  1-800-259-9231 on this 13th of May, 2003, live, worldwide edition.
[00:42:04.124 --> 00:42:06.547]  Your calls are coming up at 800-259-9231.
[00:42:26.161 --> 00:42:28.483]  Saudi bombing death rises again.
[00:42:28.503 --> 00:42:30.144]  This couldn't come at a more convenient time.
[00:42:30.284 --> 00:42:40.152]  I predicted that if we backed the globalist off from carrying out big terror attacks here domestically, which they said was a certainty, Gary Hart and CFRs and smallpox would hit Dallas and Cleveland and Denver.
[00:42:40.192 --> 00:42:41.493]  He said it on Hannity and Combs.
[00:42:42.254 --> 00:42:43.375]  Give up all your rights.
[00:42:43.415 --> 00:42:45.216]  We're going to take your rights for your own good.
[00:42:45.677 --> 00:42:46.417]  Give up your liberty.
[00:42:46.437 --> 00:42:47.258]  We'll keep you safe.
[00:42:47.338 --> 00:42:50.361]  Setting that paradigm in your mind, which is a false paradigm.
[00:42:50.721 --> 00:42:51.942]  Give up liberty, you get tyranny.
[00:42:53.433 --> 00:42:56.735]  They've had the whole cabinet out fear-mongering on the news shows.
[00:42:58.397 --> 00:43:04.601]  This is the reality, and I predicted that you'd see bombings in the Arab areas, in Europe.
[00:43:05.742 --> 00:43:08.804]  Smaller ones would be their plan B. Now how many shows did I say that?
[00:43:08.844 --> 00:43:09.825]  Probably 50 shows.
[00:43:11.286 --> 00:43:16.009]  From all the evidence, the MO, past actions, I know who the number one suspects of this are.
[00:43:17.690 --> 00:43:19.311]  An Al-Qaeda CIA team.
[00:43:19.351 --> 00:43:20.752]  That's who Al-Qaeda is, folks.
[00:43:20.792 --> 00:43:22.033]  That's who was flown out to safety.
[00:43:22.053 --> 00:43:22.233]  8,000 leaders.
[00:43:23.826 --> 00:43:29.908]  When Kandahar was about to fall in a staged event, would carry these things out and look for more.
[00:43:31.649 --> 00:43:33.190]  And that's a real shame.
[00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:35.030]  A real shame.
[00:43:36.351 --> 00:43:37.591]  It could be Mossad.
[00:43:37.731 --> 00:43:42.453]  They got a big track record of this according to UPI and Haaretz and AP.
[00:43:43.654 --> 00:43:50.576]  We have a giant archive on PrisonPlanet.com full of where they admit that Israel found the Hamash.
[00:43:51.276 --> 00:43:52.457]  They control these people.
[00:43:53.328 --> 00:43:57.370]  Through subsidiaries, their leaders, Mossad or Al-Qaeda, they don't even know it.
[00:43:57.390 --> 00:43:59.471]  They're giving them wherewithal to carry it out.
[00:43:59.531 --> 00:44:03.473]  But it certainly comes at a perfect time with these top-off two drills.
[00:44:03.773 --> 00:44:13.038]  These federal martial law FEMA takeover drills that are happening with the burning buses in the Budlam in several states in Washington and Illinois and other areas.
[00:44:13.098 --> 00:44:17.900]  And yesterday they had fire trucks and police and many checkpoints being set up in Austin.
[00:44:17.940 --> 00:44:18.880]  They're running something.
[00:44:19.241 --> 00:44:21.782]  Here yesterday I was caught in the middle of it on Mopac.
[00:44:22.808 --> 00:44:52.351]  I'm living in Alice in Wonderland fruitcake system and it's incredible so we'll get your response to the bombing and remember the Bali bombing we have this on PrisonPlanet.com as well and InfoWars.com the Bali bombing archive where it came out in the BBC came out in the Age in the Sydney Morning Herald in the Asia Times and the Taiwan Straits Times that they were ordered by the US government the Taiwanese who got prior knowledge of the bombing
[00:44:53.078 --> 00:44:54.099]  Plastic Explosives.
[00:44:54.499 --> 00:44:55.740]  FBI was on the ground within minutes.
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:58.542]  To not warn the Mali's government.
[00:45:00.303 --> 00:45:02.824]  Not warn them that the bombing was coming.
[00:45:02.964 --> 00:45:06.106]  And don't worry, they found a PASI to say he did it under torture.
[00:45:07.387 --> 00:45:09.048]  And that got Australia behind the war.
[00:45:09.068 --> 00:45:10.850]  You don't wake up to this.
[00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:12.811]  It's all mainstream.
[00:45:13.091 --> 00:45:14.872]  But it's reported and nothing's done about it.
[00:45:16.393 --> 00:45:18.294]  It's just reported like it's no big deal.
[00:45:19.235 --> 00:45:20.796]  They just do this all the time.
[00:45:22.159 --> 00:45:25.963]  And they'll make a big deal out of, you know, some stupid celebrity or something.
[00:45:27.624 --> 00:45:30.427]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:45:31.247 --> 00:45:33.750]  Saudi bombing deaths rise.
[00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:38.254]  And we are really sad for the Americans, the Australians and others that died.
[00:45:39.755 --> 00:45:44.840]  And now they'll say, see this legitimizes what we did and they've got these stupid anthrax trucks.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.241]  Which is ridiculous, folks.
[00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:48.501]  These things are rusted out.
[00:45:48.922 --> 00:45:50.022]  No wheels on them.
[00:45:50.382 --> 00:45:52.783]  Obviously 15 to 25 years old.
[00:45:53.704 --> 00:45:56.445]  Sitting around saying, oh look, they've got these weapons.
[00:45:57.485 --> 00:45:58.906]  And there's no telling what they are.
[00:45:58.966 --> 00:46:00.827]  They've got canopy sides.
[00:46:00.847 --> 00:46:03.268]  Can you believe any of that?
[00:46:05.149 --> 00:46:09.811]  And they've been caught with the fake thing out of Niger there in Africa.
[00:46:10.811 --> 00:46:12.552]  Claiming that it was a nuclear document.
[00:46:12.592 --> 00:46:14.593]  Turned out our government fabricated it.
[00:46:15.268 --> 00:46:17.950]  It wasn't like they found some document and were mistaken about it.
[00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:19.090]  They fabricated it.
[00:46:20.731 --> 00:46:31.377]  They showed dead from the Iran-Iraq war in a government mortuary in an exchange of dead program like we do with Vietnam and North Korea to this day and said, oh look, mass graves.
[00:46:31.397 --> 00:46:34.999]  They found chemical plants and said it was chemical weapons and it was bug spray plants.
[00:46:35.879 --> 00:46:37.720]  I mean, how many times you gotta be lied to?
[00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:39.642]  And I thought they'd find some weapons.
[00:46:39.702 --> 00:46:41.102]  I mean, Saddam's a bad guy.
[00:46:42.883 --> 00:46:43.924]  But he's their bad guy.
[00:46:45.083 --> 00:46:46.504]  It's unbelievable.
[00:46:46.524 --> 00:46:51.926]  And there's only a few thousand globalist minions and power brokers that work for the big central banks.
[00:46:52.406 --> 00:46:54.327]  Only a few thousand hitmen they've got.
[00:46:54.787 --> 00:46:57.508]  And other than that, it's all run through ignorance.
[00:46:57.568 --> 00:47:01.369]  It's all run by conning good people to believe in this fraudulent system.
[00:47:01.930 --> 00:47:05.491]  Before I go any further and come back and take calls, we'll start going to calls straight when we get back.
[00:47:06.892 --> 00:47:13.860]  I've produced 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, two films, about 9-1-1, Masters of Terror is part two.
[00:47:14.421 --> 00:47:16.463]  I've written a book, Descent into Tyranny, 230 pages, only $12, incredible book.
[00:47:20.023 --> 00:47:36.703]  And now I've made Police State 3 Total Enslavement, an amazing new film that details Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, Total Information Awareness Network, other examples of government-sponsored terrorism, dozens of documented examples from around the world,
[00:47:37.913 --> 00:47:39.173]  It is an incredible film.

[00:47:40.313 --> 00:47:42.254]  2 hours 37 minutes.

[00:48:35.854 --> 00:48:37.155]  Alex Jones here, America.

[00:48:53.243 --> 00:48:57.025]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:48:57.285 --> 00:49:01.908]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:49:01.988 --> 00:49:08.250]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.

[00:49:32.518 --> 00:49:37.000]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.442]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:49:41.742 --> 00:49:42.283]  We listened.
[00:49:42.603 --> 00:49:47.565]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:49:47.845 --> 00:49:48.345]  We listened.
[00:49:48.726 --> 00:49:51.767]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:49:52.187 --> 00:49:52.727]  We listened.
[00:49:53.188 --> 00:49:56.049]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[00:49:56.169 --> 00:49:56.349]  I think?

[00:51:35.136 --> 00:51:39.079]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:51:45.164 --> 00:51:53.892]  Yes, Lord Howe landed the Imperial Emissary right on time to comfort them after the attacks.
[00:51:56.019 --> 00:51:57.961]  But now it legitimizes everything.
[00:51:57.981 --> 00:52:01.604]  See, we're taking your rights for your safety.
[00:52:02.004 --> 00:52:03.465]  That's why the border stays wide open.
[00:52:03.505 --> 00:52:08.830]  Jim, Mike, Tony, Dante, others, your calls are coming up right now.
[00:52:09.411 --> 00:52:11.452]  Jim in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:52:12.253 --> 00:52:13.394]  Yes, hi Alex.
[00:52:13.774 --> 00:52:14.435]  How you doing sir?
[00:52:14.455 --> 00:52:19.479]  I wanted to comment about the Conyers and McCarthy there.
[00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:23.330]  Conyers speaks for himself for years.
[00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:24.471]  Everybody knows what he is.
[00:52:24.531 --> 00:52:25.351]  He's a left-winger.
[00:52:25.651 --> 00:52:30.112]  As leftist as he's going to get, so you're going to expect the gun control out of him.
[00:52:30.432 --> 00:52:37.073]  But notice this alert says Clinton and liberal over and over again, but nothing about Bush saying he'll sign this.
[00:52:39.533 --> 00:52:42.394]  Well, and your point being what?
[00:52:43.774 --> 00:52:45.774]  My point being that it's universal.
[00:52:45.815 --> 00:52:47.355]  They're coming after our guns.
[00:52:48.115 --> 00:52:48.375]  Right.
[00:52:51.095 --> 00:52:51.895]  Well, I'm listening.
[00:52:52.255 --> 00:52:53.136]  No, I mean, go ahead.
[00:52:53.176 --> 00:52:54.156]  I'm just throwing that in.
[00:52:54.716 --> 00:52:57.317]  No, I know they're coming after him, and we all know it.
[00:52:57.697 --> 00:52:59.017]  It's like you've said it before.
[00:52:59.057 --> 00:53:02.018]  It's like, with these people, it's like the Chinese restaurant.
[00:53:02.078 --> 00:53:06.159]  Pick one column A, one column B. It makes no difference, you know?
[00:53:07.099 --> 00:53:09.500]  As far as the other lady, I know her personally.
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.460]  I know her family.
[00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:14.861]  I hate to, you know, if the word... Hey, number one, do me a big favor.
[00:53:14.901 --> 00:53:15.682]  Turn your radio off.
[00:53:16.602 --> 00:53:16.862]  Yeah.
[00:53:17.262 --> 00:53:19.223]  It's dysfunctional as a... Sir?
[00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:20.423]  Yeah, I will.
[00:53:20.959 --> 00:53:22.399]  Dysfunctional is a word.
[00:53:22.519 --> 00:53:24.420]  They're dysfunctional.
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.860]  I've known these people for years, you know.
[00:53:27.301 --> 00:53:33.102]  And the only thing the lady... I don't even know if she'd know which end of the round to put into the... Well, that's it.
[00:53:33.122 --> 00:53:36.643]  I mean, the liberals... I've told this story, and then I'll let you continue, but let me just add this.
[00:53:37.063 --> 00:53:40.024]  My dad has a friend who's a major newspaper editor here in Texas.
[00:53:40.684 --> 00:53:42.824]  And they come over a few times a year when I'm there.
[00:53:42.844 --> 00:53:45.285]  I'm not over with my parents much, so they come over more than a few times.
[00:53:45.325 --> 00:53:48.146]  But I see them a few times, going back to when I was a kid.
[00:53:48.906 --> 00:53:49.946]  They went to college together.
[00:53:50.931 --> 00:53:52.892]  And this guy's from Texas, but he's a liberal.
[00:53:52.912 --> 00:53:54.052]  His parents didn't own guns.
[00:53:54.772 --> 00:53:56.873]  One time, I was leaving some of my guns at my parents.
[00:53:56.893 --> 00:53:58.753]  I was already moved out of home, but I was in college.
[00:53:59.293 --> 00:54:02.834]  And I walk in, I get a .357 Magnum, a rifle.
[00:54:03.254 --> 00:54:05.055]  I'm going out to do some target shooting.
[00:54:05.455 --> 00:54:08.296]  I'm walking out from the gun safe, through the house.
[00:54:08.356 --> 00:54:09.316]  He sees the guns.
[00:54:09.356 --> 00:54:11.016]  He begins shaking and convulsing.
[00:54:11.456 --> 00:54:13.357]  I go, I go, uh, Jim,
[00:54:14.142 --> 00:54:15.763]  And I know you're Jim, but his name's Jim, too.
[00:54:16.203 --> 00:54:18.284]  I go, Jim, it's a handgun.
[00:54:18.304 --> 00:54:19.085]  Look, it's unloaded.
[00:54:19.125 --> 00:54:20.025]  It's a revolver.
[00:54:20.345 --> 00:54:21.966]  It won't bite you.
[00:54:22.246 --> 00:54:26.608]  He thought it was a 45-foot cobra dripping venom.
[00:54:28.329 --> 00:54:30.830]  These people are domesticated little idiots.
[00:54:30.850 --> 00:54:31.331]  Go ahead.
[00:54:32.051 --> 00:54:34.852]  Well, with her, it's not only that.
[00:54:35.293 --> 00:54:38.014]  She got elected on the issue.
[00:54:38.254 --> 00:54:41.896]  You know, I'm sorry if the husband got killed, and I guess so is everybody else.
[00:54:42.375 --> 00:54:45.476]  But that doesn't necessarily qualify you to become a congressman.
[00:54:45.496 --> 00:54:48.998]  Another one of those convenient plane crashes, hmm?
[00:54:51.779 --> 00:55:00.322]  But, uh, yeah, it's amazing, Jim, but looking at this, yes, what I'm saying is, though, the useful idiot liberals on the ground are afraid of guns.
[00:55:00.382 --> 00:55:05.705]  The leaders obviously want them, as Mrs. Brady said, so they can have socialism.
[00:55:05.745 --> 00:55:06.225]  Anything else?
[00:55:08.647 --> 00:55:09.368]  Anything else, Jim?
[00:55:09.809 --> 00:55:11.091]  Alright, I appreciate the call.
[00:55:11.332 --> 00:55:14.217]  Let's talk to Mike in Illinois.
[00:55:14.237 --> 00:55:15.098]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:55:15.118 --> 00:55:15.519]  Go ahead.
[00:55:16.741 --> 00:55:17.603]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:55:17.763 --> 00:55:18.204]  Good, sir.
[00:55:18.584 --> 00:55:19.846]  Alex, I'm going this afternoon.
[00:55:19.886 --> 00:55:20.467]  They're doing the
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.021]  The pre-drill for the terrorist attacks here in Chicago.
[00:55:24.301 --> 00:55:25.802]  I'm begging you to videotape.
[00:55:26.102 --> 00:55:26.242]  I am.
[00:55:26.322 --> 00:55:28.743]  Me and two of my friends, I'm leaving work here about two o'clock.
[00:55:28.843 --> 00:55:36.466]  There's lots of static shots, slowly zooming in, zooming out, the hysteria, the hundreds of people playing like they've been blown to bits.
[00:55:36.807 --> 00:55:44.750]  You notice the footage you saw yesterday from Seattle is exactly what I have in Road to Tyranny, where they do the drills north of Austin.
[00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:45.270]  Right.
[00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:49.712]  And now Alex, now see, because I remember when I first started listening to your show about three years ago,
[00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:54.072]  Uh, I remember you here talking about all the stuff going on in the other states and never heard anything.
[00:55:54.192 --> 00:55:55.552]  Remember I said fake terror drills?
[00:55:55.612 --> 00:55:59.094]  Right, and now here it is in Chicago, the third largest city in the United States, doing it.
[00:55:59.174 --> 00:56:02.396]  So, uh, I'm going to get it and just send it to your address.
[00:56:02.416 --> 00:56:04.116]  Stay there, I want to talk more about it when we get back.
[00:56:04.236 --> 00:56:06.297]  Stay there, Mike, and we'll go to Dante and others.
[00:56:07.298 --> 00:56:07.618]  Listen.
[00:56:08.858 --> 00:56:13.881]  These drills always coincide or come right before real attacks.
[00:56:15.542 --> 00:56:16.142]  Watch out.
[00:56:16.682 --> 00:56:17.502]  Brace yourselves.
[00:56:17.763 --> 00:56:18.703]  Expose the terrorists.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:24.261]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[00:56:24.481 --> 00:56:30.804]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[00:56:31.104 --> 00:56:39.567]  Would you like to make your asset, make your... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.233 --> 00:56:47.874]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.534 --> 00:56:49.575]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.316 --> 00:56:51.417]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.078 --> 00:56:52.878]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.659 --> 00:56:55.581]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.601 --> 00:56:59.004]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.404 --> 00:57:03.488]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:11.332]  Alright, already into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[00:57:11.572 --> 00:57:12.912]  Wide open phones in this hour.
[00:57:12.972 --> 00:57:28.898]  We talk about the tragic, convenient, right on time bombings to legitimize the police state and these drills that are running, the FEMA takeover drills, the martial law preparation activation test that's going on for the FEMA takeover.
[00:57:31.062 --> 00:57:42.606]  And we'll get into some of the gun-grabbing of Lord Bush and the Democrats, and Emperor Bush, Puppet Bush, Puppet Bush and his minions, and then we'll also get into a bunch of other news.
[00:57:43.506 --> 00:57:46.507]  Police were serving a traffic ticket warrant and killed three dogs.
[00:57:46.527 --> 00:57:47.847]  You see these stories every week.
[00:57:48.508 --> 00:57:49.268]  That's coming up.
[00:57:50.317 --> 00:57:56.142]  But right now, we were talking to Mike in Chicago, where they're going to do their takeover drill today.
[00:57:56.222 --> 00:58:00.905]  And Mike was saying he's been listening for years and heard me talk about these takeover drills.
[00:58:00.985 --> 00:58:06.670]  In Denver, in 99, they practice putting people in the sports stadiums, confiscating guns, bringing in troops.
[00:58:07.070 --> 00:58:10.433]  This is all part of merging the military and the police and the general constabulary.
[00:58:11.393 --> 00:58:13.515]  And it's pretty disgusting.
[00:58:13.735 --> 00:58:14.976]  And the border stays wide open.
[00:58:15.637 --> 00:58:16.477]  Welcome, Mike.
[00:58:16.537 --> 00:58:16.958]  Go ahead.
[00:58:17.558 --> 00:58:25.504]  Alex, the really strange thing, it's not strange, I shouldn't say that, but most people in the metropolitan area, they don't really seem to care.
[00:58:25.564 --> 00:58:27.645]  They just kind of go on with their life as usual.
[00:58:28.426 --> 00:58:29.607]  But they're bringing actors in.
[00:58:29.647 --> 00:58:30.567]  I don't know if you're aware of this.
[00:58:30.627 --> 00:58:31.528]  They're bringing professionals.
[00:58:31.548 --> 00:58:33.810]  Well, I mean, sir, haven't you seen The Road to Tyranny?
[00:58:33.830 --> 00:58:35.411]  With the role players?
[00:58:35.711 --> 00:58:36.912]  No, I did not see that film.
[00:58:37.813 --> 00:58:38.873]  That's the one I'm going to order.
[00:58:38.953 --> 00:58:39.534]  I have not seen it.
[00:58:39.554 --> 00:58:42.356]  That's why I wanted to get the address and where to mail this video once I shoot it.
[00:58:43.256 --> 00:58:45.218]  Well, I'll send you a free copy if you send me the video, but listen.
[00:58:45.791 --> 00:58:47.452]  Here's the other thing, too, Mike.
[00:58:49.313 --> 00:58:53.716]  Understanding all of this, have you seen Police State 2000?
[00:58:53.756 --> 00:58:58.279]  They hired role players to scream out, an American, not the camp, please!
[00:58:58.319 --> 00:59:00.841]  Right, I did see Police State 2000.
[00:59:01.401 --> 00:59:03.603]  A friend of mine has ordered the videos, and I actually met him.
[00:59:03.643 --> 00:59:13.509]  He works for a large electric company in Illinois, and he had your show on the radio a year and a half ago, and I had it on, and we were both working in the back behind a building, and I said, you listen to Jones?
[00:59:13.569 --> 00:59:14.329]  He said, I sure do.
[00:59:14.389 --> 00:59:14.850]  I said, wow.
[00:59:16.088 --> 00:59:17.689]  So, what exactly is going on?
[00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:25.295]  Well, the people around here, the local news last night were interviewing people at one of the large hospitals, Cook County Hospital.
[00:59:25.415 --> 00:59:27.417]  I love it, it's so wonderful!
[00:59:27.637 --> 00:59:29.258]  Oh yeah, they're brainwashed.
[00:59:29.338 --> 00:59:31.180]  Now that's who they show, remember that.
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:31.620]  Right.
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:33.662]  But they're bringing actors in, Alex.
[00:59:33.822 --> 00:59:36.944]  Actual, professional actors to go in there and do this.
[00:59:37.404 --> 00:59:41.967]  Yeah, to run around in front of the cameras, create the perception we're being attacked by terror.
[00:59:42.287 --> 00:59:45.129]  We ought to thank the Globalists for doing this instead of carrying out real stuff.
[00:59:45.690 --> 00:59:46.390]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:48.712]  You know, I'll tell you, too, that they were shown in the news yesterday.
[00:59:49.574 --> 00:59:51.295]  The syringes all laid out at the hospital.
[00:59:51.315 --> 00:59:52.656]  They were interviewing a hospital worker.
[00:59:52.897 --> 00:59:53.597]  They're so excited.
[00:59:53.617 --> 00:59:54.858]  The woman just got pre-med.
[00:59:55.338 --> 00:59:56.079]  She's all excited.
[00:59:56.099 --> 00:59:58.801]  She's going to have her first chance to work on this.
[00:59:58.841 --> 01:00:02.124]  Now that is a fraud because they're practicing for forced inoculations.
[01:00:02.164 --> 01:00:03.525]  We read the LA Times article.
[01:00:03.945 --> 01:00:07.808]  296 people out of 11 million they wanted to vaccinate.
[01:00:08.228 --> 01:00:10.190]  Almost no one is taking these shots.
[01:00:10.550 --> 01:00:15.394]  So they're trying to hype up the dangerous smallpox shot that's now killing one out of a thousand that take it.
[01:00:16.034 --> 01:00:21.701]  And they're now offering to pay health workers double if they'll force inject us, but they don't have to take it.
[01:00:22.062 --> 01:00:22.262]  Right.
[01:00:22.783 --> 01:00:23.764]  Exactly, Alex.
[01:00:24.104 --> 01:00:25.085]  I'll send this video to you.
[01:00:25.346 --> 01:00:25.846]  Now, is it the 2000 Lamar?
[01:00:25.866 --> 01:00:25.986]  It's 3000.
[01:00:26.026 --> 01:00:26.727]  I'm sorry, 3000 Lamar.
[01:00:26.747 --> 01:00:27.768]  Right to Alex Jones at 3001.
[01:00:34.376 --> 01:00:40.983]  South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:00:42.365 --> 01:00:46.810]  Now let me tell you what they did in Austin in 99-2000.
[01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:53.537]  They had at least eight, we know, probably dozens, where they denounced something biological made two police officers pass out.
[01:00:54.170 --> 01:00:55.091]  They want to prepare us, Alex.
[01:01:15.763 --> 01:01:17.084]  Anything else you want to add, Mike?
[01:01:17.104 --> 01:01:17.865]  No, that's it, Alex.
[01:01:17.905 --> 01:01:19.767]  But like you said, get ready for the big show.
[01:01:19.807 --> 01:01:22.869]  Something's going to go down here so they can have it all ready for us.
[01:01:23.009 --> 01:01:26.192]  Well, they already had a big show for us over in Saudi Arabia.
[01:01:26.432 --> 01:01:26.612]  Right.
[01:01:26.732 --> 01:01:27.573]  But I mean here, Alex.
[01:01:27.613 --> 01:01:28.994]  Right here in our own front yard.
[01:01:29.615 --> 01:01:32.497]  Well, it's terrible that some Americans died in this bombing.
[01:01:32.537 --> 01:01:33.758]  We need to stop who's doing it.
[01:01:33.818 --> 01:01:35.379]  But I've got a good feeling who is doing it.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:41.945]  And it means they've shifted for now to Plan B. Just some small keep-the-pot-warm attacks.
[01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:48.535]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:52.977]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:01:53.257 --> 01:01:53.817]  We listened.
[01:01:54.117 --> 01:01:59.099]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:01:59.379 --> 01:01:59.860]  We listened.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.281]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:02:03.701 --> 01:02:04.241]  We listened.
[01:02:04.722 --> 01:02:07.863]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:02:08.083 --> 01:02:08.423]  I don't know.
[01:02:35.324 --> 01:02:38.867]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:02:39.087 --> 01:02:40.528]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:02:43.249 --> 01:02:50.634]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:50.894 --> 01:02:55.637]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:55.857 --> 01:03:01.501]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:01.741 --> 01:03:13.629]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:03:13.669 --> 01:03:18.192]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:03:18.352 --> 01:03:20.873]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:03:21.094 --> 01:03:27.818]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:03:28.038 --> 01:03:35.703]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:03:36.564 --> 01:03:39.826]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:03:42.087 --> 01:03:42.808]  Are you prepared?
[01:03:42.828 --> 01:03:45.429]  It seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:50.072]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[01:03:50.373 --> 01:03:53.855]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[01:03:54.075 --> 01:03:56.217]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[01:03:56.937 --> 01:04:00.938]  Jerry Deddy from the Ark Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[01:04:01.158 --> 01:04:04.098]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[01:04:04.198 --> 01:04:11.280]  Call the Ark Institute today at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:16.821]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[01:04:17.081 --> 01:04:22.082]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[01:04:22.302 --> 01:04:23.342]  Jerry can help here too.
[01:04:24.162 --> 01:04:28.823]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[01:04:29.064 --> 01:04:32.985]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[01:04:33.105 --> 01:04:36.726]  Call the Ark Institute today, toll free 1-800-255-1912.
[01:04:37.306 --> 01:04:41.947]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com.
[01:04:43.968 --> 01:04:50.010]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:50.610 --> 01:04:53.591]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:54.975 --> 01:05:04.742]  Welcome back as we fight the enemy combatants, as we fight the usurpers that are overthrowing the Republic and setting up a military dictatorship owned by the private banks.
[01:05:05.603 --> 01:05:17.012]  The Euro and the Central Bank of the United States, the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve said three and a half years ago at the Davos Economic Forum they plan to plunge the dollar
[01:05:18.197 --> 01:05:24.163]  The Treasury Secretaries have been putting down the dollar the last few years, doing nothing to prop it up.
[01:05:24.263 --> 01:05:27.866]  Greenspan's been bad-mouthing the economy, trying to drive it down.
[01:05:27.946 --> 01:05:34.252]  It is totally staged, but as long as we're in a war, people will not blame the government and will accept this.
[01:05:34.272 --> 01:05:36.094]  This is all being carefully crafted.
[01:05:37.532 --> 01:05:39.374]  The people that own Europe own America.
[01:05:39.394 --> 01:05:42.276]  There was no fight between France and Germany and the U.S.
[01:05:42.596 --> 01:05:43.237]  and the U.N.
[01:05:43.297 --> 01:05:44.738]  It's all staged.
[01:05:45.158 --> 01:05:47.340]  Giving you two different choices of world government.
[01:05:47.761 --> 01:05:48.921]  That's all they're doing.
[01:05:49.462 --> 01:05:50.263]  That is the facts.
[01:05:50.323 --> 01:05:51.724]  It's their own policy reports.
[01:05:52.324 --> 01:05:54.966]  Dante in Texas and Ed in Pennsylvania and others.
[01:05:55.006 --> 01:05:55.847]  Go ahead, Dante.
[01:05:55.867 --> 01:05:56.988]  Yes, Alex.
[01:05:57.108 --> 01:05:57.769]  Hello.
[01:05:57.789 --> 01:05:59.290]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:06:00.071 --> 01:06:01.132]  I first
[01:06:02.065 --> 01:06:07.430]  I came aware of you a few months back when I got a little mini shortwave radio.
[01:06:08.111 --> 01:06:09.692]  Here's the train in the background.
[01:06:10.733 --> 01:06:26.068]  And I was very thankful that I found a man that was really speaking out on the truth of really what's going on in this country and really the world.
[01:06:27.848 --> 01:06:54.767]  I myself, like you, came into awareness actually, you probably much long before me, but six years ago I had a road to Damascus experience with a living God and after that I came to much awareness of the realities of the world and really what's going on.
[01:06:57.143 --> 01:07:05.372]  And I respect your courage to speak out on the truth of really what's going on.
[01:07:07.254 --> 01:07:18.727]  Since then, I have traveled across the United States, and I have witnessed things that people have no idea of.
[01:07:20.218 --> 01:07:23.799]  They would be in confirmation even to what the things you speak of.
[01:07:24.059 --> 01:07:26.140]  What have you seen traveling the United States?
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:33.542]  Well, I have seen, now what's very interesting is you use the word fraud and craft.
[01:07:35.863 --> 01:07:49.327]  I have been in situations as traveling as a missionary, I call myself a missionary, and I have been to these so-called places that are supposed to be
[01:07:50.705 --> 01:07:55.688]  Up and up, and they use the name of God, and they're actually businesses.
[01:07:56.848 --> 01:08:04.972]  And some of these places, if I can make mention of their name, I... Well, we know a lot of the big establishment Christian groups are just businesses.
[01:08:04.992 --> 01:08:05.613]  I mean, that's obvious.
[01:08:05.633 --> 01:08:06.333]  Yes, they are.
[01:08:06.633 --> 01:08:09.995]  And see, many Christians have no idea.
[01:08:10.775 --> 01:08:15.398]  I mean, I can write a book, Alex, just on visiting these
[01:08:16.741 --> 01:08:23.603]  These shelters where people give their clothing to, they give money, they give thousands of dollars.
[01:08:23.623 --> 01:08:31.925]  Well I gotta tell you, that stuff ripping the clothes off and running little scams is nothing compared to getting out of the way in Red Cross, when they're saying give money for the Iraqi people.
[01:08:32.345 --> 01:08:34.826]  Nothing you give to the Red Cross goes to anybody.
[01:08:35.066 --> 01:08:37.627]  It goes to the gun grabbers, it goes to the globalists.
[01:08:38.067 --> 01:08:40.728]  I've said this over and over again, they always get caught doing it.
[01:08:41.168 --> 01:08:45.490]  The money for the victims in Oklahoma City, the Red Cross actually robbed the mail.
[01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:47.991]  They lost a lawsuit over it.
[01:08:48.091 --> 01:08:49.532]  I mean, these people are amazing.
[01:08:49.752 --> 01:09:00.397]  Yes, and it's really, and I understand your amazement because when I first learned of these things, even as you speak of about six years ago, I was amazed.
[01:09:00.417 --> 01:09:02.337]  I was quite shaken up.
[01:09:03.538 --> 01:09:05.699]  And then I came to a balance.
[01:09:06.417 --> 01:09:10.960]  Well, the level of corruption right under the surface is staggering.
[01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:18.005]  And it's growing like a viral infection out of control, metastasizing like a vicious cancer.
[01:09:18.625 --> 01:09:20.106]  And we've got to stand against it.
[01:09:20.166 --> 01:09:22.888]  We've got to admit the problem and we're going to fix it.
[01:09:23.288 --> 01:09:23.469]  Yes.
[01:09:24.429 --> 01:09:29.753]  If I can, if I may present a balance that I was shown.
[01:09:33.466 --> 01:09:35.508]  If I may make mention... Sure, go ahead, sir.
[01:09:35.548 --> 01:09:36.689]  You're on the air.
[01:09:36.769 --> 01:09:37.329]  Thank you.
[01:09:37.509 --> 01:09:40.512]  Now, you had mentioned things like New World Order.
[01:09:41.633 --> 01:09:47.958]  You've talked about a love affair that the Globalists are having with America.
[01:09:48.678 --> 01:09:53.722]  You've mentioned how people are trusting so much in a false god of the government.
[01:09:55.103 --> 01:10:01.128]  You have made mention of it being like Caesar, a type of his kingdom.
[01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:10.654]  And also, you had a guest on CUNY that said, they want us to give up our freedoms for peace and safety.
[01:10:10.734 --> 01:10:12.655]  And that never happens, yeah.
[01:10:12.715 --> 01:10:19.080]  Yes, and then you'd also, there was mention of... That's what the kidnapper says, they say, do what I say and you'll be okay.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.821]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:10:21.061 --> 01:10:27.045]  And also, the Statue of Liberty, rooted by the French and also connected with Babylon.
[01:10:27.225 --> 01:10:30.928]  Yeah, why didn't they send that occult thing back to them if the French are so bad?
[01:10:31.804 --> 01:10:45.131]  Exactly, and because I have committed my life, Alex, I am out there in the midst of society.
[01:10:46.111 --> 01:10:58.278]  I travel by backpack, and I encounter people that are amazing, and they bring so much confirmation, even like you bring, as I listen to you.
[01:10:59.138 --> 01:11:00.679]  But I also spend my life
[01:11:01.377 --> 01:11:02.498]  Also in the Scriptures.
[01:11:03.158 --> 01:11:13.583]  And what's amazing to me, the things that are being spoken, not only by yourself, but there's a few others like you out there, that the Scripture speaks of.
[01:11:14.424 --> 01:11:18.206]  I hear you, and I appreciate your call, Nante, and it's good to have you as a listener.
[01:11:18.606 --> 01:11:19.106]  Take care.
[01:11:19.826 --> 01:11:20.987]  Ed in Pennsylvania.
[01:11:21.087 --> 01:11:21.887]  Ed, you're on the air.
[01:11:21.947 --> 01:11:22.408]  Go ahead.
[01:11:22.648 --> 01:11:28.731]  Hey Alex, I got my subscription renewal from the NRA a couple weeks ago.
[01:11:30.355 --> 01:11:35.036]  What did you think of their alert admitting the massive gun grab that Bush is going to resign?
[01:11:35.336 --> 01:11:39.757]  An expanded Clinton assault ban, banning everything, basically.
[01:11:40.497 --> 01:11:52.579]  Well, I think it's because I sent my thing back blank with a note on there saying if you don't come across with this Lady of Peace Act, me and thousands of other people probably sent it back blank like that.
[01:11:53.379 --> 01:11:54.519]  That's what forced them to do that.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:57.360]  Oh, I totally agree with you.
[01:11:57.958 --> 01:12:01.580]  And I thank you for warning us, you know, about this.
[01:12:03.361 --> 01:12:07.183]  Well, when we were trying to defeat gun bills in Texas, the NRA was fighting us.
[01:12:07.263 --> 01:12:08.504]  I mean, there's something else, man.
[01:12:09.164 --> 01:12:15.668]  Alex, if they want our guns that bad, we better really stock up, load up, get all the guns you can, all the ammunition.
[01:12:16.328 --> 01:12:18.089]  I'm going to hook up with a friend of mine or two.
[01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:26.094]  We're going to get a nice .50 cal semi with a big scope on it and just, you know, put it in a safe house.
[01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:28.590]  Well, guns are also a good investment.
[01:12:28.611 --> 01:12:31.691]  They're only going up in value.
[01:12:32.652 --> 01:12:35.372]  And the globalists plan a lot of bad things for us.
[01:12:35.432 --> 01:12:37.113]  Things that dwarf what they've done so far.
[01:12:37.153 --> 01:12:40.854]  And that's why they want our guns so desperately bad.
[01:12:41.714 --> 01:12:50.056]  And if this is an illustration of the reality that there is only one party in Washington, the New World Order party, I don't know what is a better example.
[01:12:50.849 --> 01:12:56.790]  You know, a lot of guys out there, we can't afford like 50 cals and stuff like that, but get together with a friend or something, you know?
[01:12:57.570 --> 01:13:00.111]  Well, I mean, a 50 cal is something you've got to drag around in a big trouble.
[01:13:00.171 --> 01:13:07.832]  I mean, you just need a shotgun, a handgun, a rifle to be proficient with it, a lot of ammo, good friends to defend yourself and your family.
[01:13:08.192 --> 01:13:15.793]  Ed, what do you think about this tragic bombing right on time, so convenient for the globalists to get their agenda through in Saudi Arabia?
[01:13:16.733 --> 01:13:19.674]  Yeah, I haven't seen it on the news yet.
[01:13:20.427 --> 01:13:24.392]  I haven't had a chance to turn the news on yet, but it's a tragedy.
[01:13:24.412 --> 01:13:34.002]  Well, they're saying dozens of Americans could be dead, upwards of 200 injured, dead Australians, dead Portuguese, folks, pretty serious.
[01:13:34.663 --> 01:13:37.326]  Like you said, Saudi Arabia is a pit of evil.
[01:13:38.155 --> 01:13:43.818]  Oh man, I mean these princes are shipping in kidnapped kids by the bucket load, by the train load.
[01:13:44.018 --> 01:13:47.480]  All these whores, they pay a million bucks a month.
[01:13:48.180 --> 01:13:50.841]  All these Miss Americas and Miss this and that.
[01:13:50.861 --> 01:13:53.543]  I mean they're all being shipped over there.
[01:13:53.603 --> 01:13:55.283]  It's just an incredible den of evil.
[01:13:55.624 --> 01:13:56.744]  And they work for the globalists.
[01:13:56.764 --> 01:13:58.005]  This is all staged.
[01:13:59.245 --> 01:14:00.586]  I'm going to order that new tape, Alex.
[01:14:01.086 --> 01:14:02.267]  Alright, appreciate the call, Ed.
[01:14:02.307 --> 01:14:04.128]  Yeah, Police State 3, total enslavement.
[01:14:04.528 --> 01:14:06.589]  Now shipping, now out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:07.299 --> 01:14:10.000]  Let's talk to, uh, who's up next, Mark?
[01:14:12.321 --> 01:14:13.482]  Who should I go to next?
[01:14:14.442 --> 01:14:14.662]  Who?
[01:14:15.783 --> 01:14:17.163]  Wanda in Missouri.
[01:14:17.243 --> 01:14:18.284]  Wanda, you're on the air.
[01:14:18.304 --> 01:14:18.764]  Go ahead.
[01:14:19.004 --> 01:14:20.464]  Yes, I was thinking.
[01:14:21.105 --> 01:14:26.447]  The fact that the nature and dangers of communism hasn't been taught in a public school
[01:14:27.173 --> 01:14:29.734]  Affirms a communist conspiracy to me.
[01:14:29.994 --> 01:14:39.356]  Well, you understand the communists are a creation of the bankers to consolidate wealth and have another evil empire to then centralize control in the West to resist that system and merge those systems.
[01:14:40.076 --> 01:14:40.176]  Yes.
[01:14:40.616 --> 01:14:47.278]  And it grieves me that so many people have no idea what godless, communistic tyranny really is.
[01:14:47.498 --> 01:14:50.418]  But see, when you use the word communist, we actually fall into their hands.
[01:14:50.498 --> 01:14:51.739]  It's all command and control.
[01:14:51.759 --> 01:14:51.819]  Yes.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.142]  Well, communism, fascism, or whatever, it's terrible.
[01:14:56.162 --> 01:15:00.284]  Yeah, centralized bureaucracy, feudalism, serfdom, neo-serfdom.
[01:15:01.165 --> 01:15:08.709]  When I was a little girl back in the thirties, there was a Russian musician that came to our church, and he played a lot of instruments.
[01:15:08.910 --> 01:15:21.017]  He also had written some books, and I got one of the books that he'd authored, and it described grandmothers and grandfathers in Russia that were forced to work in the mines
[01:15:21.653 --> 01:15:28.316]  They were carrying heavy buckets of coal until they were weakened and collapsed and then they were horse whipped.
[01:15:29.016 --> 01:15:31.898]  I got a pretty good idea of what tyranny really is.
[01:15:32.038 --> 01:15:32.918]  Oh, and don't worry.
[01:15:33.218 --> 01:15:35.919]  The new economy, Ashcroft has set it as prisons.
[01:15:35.979 --> 01:15:37.340]  Number one part of our economy.
[01:15:37.820 --> 01:15:38.580]  More crimes.
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.582]  You'll go to prison for life for misdemeanors in this new wonderland.
[01:15:42.982 --> 01:15:47.164]  Federal retraining where the feds pay you but you work in a private corporation.
[01:15:47.584 --> 01:15:48.945]  That's the new America.
[01:15:48.965 --> 01:15:49.945]  Doesn't it sound wonderful?
[01:15:50.566 --> 01:15:50.966]  Oh, yes.
[01:15:51.812 --> 01:15:54.815]  And people were having to meet secretly to read the Word of God.
[01:15:54.835 --> 01:16:07.687]  What they had learned in the Russian churches was just a babble of, I guess, just approved kind of teaching.
[01:16:07.908 --> 01:16:10.370]  Same thing we're starting to get with our big churches here.
[01:16:11.111 --> 01:16:12.152]  Yes, that's right.
[01:16:12.172 --> 01:16:16.176]  Churches where they basically say that the government is God.
[01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:18.530]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:16:18.630 --> 01:16:19.811]  Yes, there is.
[01:16:19.831 --> 01:16:20.231]  Stay there.
[01:16:20.271 --> 01:16:21.291]  I'll come back to you.
[01:16:21.651 --> 01:16:24.292]  We'll be right back, folks, with her call and a bunch of other news.
[01:16:25.112 --> 01:16:28.633]  I got this story where the deputy shot three dogs for absolutely no reason.
[01:16:28.653 --> 01:16:29.993]  I'd like to hear about this.
[01:16:30.053 --> 01:16:30.814]  It happens all the time.
[01:16:31.314 --> 01:16:33.494]  It's the bloodthirsty, militarized nature.
[01:16:34.095 --> 01:16:35.735]  Hey, better than shooting people's families.
[01:16:35.755 --> 01:16:36.455]  They usually do that.
[01:16:36.475 --> 01:16:36.535]  1-800-259-9231.

[01:16:37.596 --> 01:16:40.136]  Hi, Jack Rounder with Midas Resources.
[01:16:40.176 --> 01:16:41.277]  The real money folks.
[01:16:47.466 --> 01:16:48.750]  Remember that ad from October of 2000?
[01:16:48.991 --> 01:16:51.718]  The Nasdaq was down 22% for the year?
[01:16:52.139 --> 01:16:53.503]  Well, it's since gone down another 40%.
[01:16:53.563 --> 01:16:55.790]  Folks, where will it bottom out?
[01:16:56.448 --> 01:17:01.813]  Unfortunately for many of us, the paper markets have already wiped out life savings with no hope of recovery.
[01:17:02.173 --> 01:17:03.294]  Don't let this happen to you.
[01:17:03.614 --> 01:17:05.435]  Call Midas Resources today at 800-686-2237.
[01:17:05.475 --> 01:17:10.239]  Gold Spot at that time was trading at about $275.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:13.862]  It is now up dramatically and looking very bullish.
[01:17:14.123 --> 01:17:18.966]  We recommended at that time to put a significant portion of your assets into the gold and silver collector coins.
[01:17:19.247 --> 01:17:20.628]  That advice still stands.
[01:17:21.128 --> 01:17:24.812]  Call Midas today, 800-686-2237.
[01:17:25.212 --> 01:17:27.455]  Collector coins are liquid, private, and portable.
[01:17:27.735 --> 01:17:30.358]  Downside risk is minimal in comparison to paper equities.
[01:17:30.698 --> 01:17:35.643]  The time to move to hard assets is now, before the momentum buyers further escalate the prices.
[01:17:35.883 --> 01:17:37.224]  Protect your financial holdings.
[01:17:37.505 --> 01:17:39.006]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[01:17:42.435 --> 01:17:45.057]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[01:17:45.297 --> 01:17:51.040]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[01:17:51.260 --> 01:17:52.641]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[01:17:52.741 --> 01:17:56.424]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[01:17:56.584 --> 01:18:02.667]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[01:18:02.807 --> 01:18:05.289]  The two most important protein superfoods known.
[01:18:05.609 --> 01:18:15.256]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water, normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[01:18:15.556 --> 01:18:19.759]  It's also very hydrating, and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[01:18:20.279 --> 01:18:23.982]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease,
[01:18:24.262 --> 01:18:28.464]  Listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley, Sunday evenings at 6 p.m.
[01:18:28.504 --> 01:18:29.904]  Central, 7 Eastern.
[01:18:30.124 --> 01:18:38.888]  Call 1-888-826-4448 to learn more or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:41.649]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer!
[01:18:42.029 --> 01:18:43.650]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:49.732]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:18:49.992 --> 01:18:55.134]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:18:55.474 --> 01:19:04.737]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:19:05.097 --> 01:19:10.058]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:14.399]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:19:14.599 --> 01:19:19.320]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:19:19.721 --> 01:19:25.582]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:19:25.962 --> 01:19:32.191]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:19:32.251 --> 01:19:33.213]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:33.233 --> 01:19:34.494]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:41.926 --> 01:19:42.667]  Are you prepared?
[01:19:42.867 --> 01:19:45.271]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[01:19:45.471 --> 01:19:49.917]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[01:19:50.217 --> 01:19:53.682]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[01:19:53.922 --> 01:19:56.065]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[01:19:56.786 --> 01:20:00.769]  Jerry Detty from the Ark Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[01:20:01.009 --> 01:20:03.932]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[01:20:04.052 --> 01:20:11.138]  Call the Ark Institute today at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[01:20:11.358 --> 01:20:16.662]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[01:20:16.942 --> 01:20:21.946]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[01:20:22.167 --> 01:20:23.187]  Jerry can help here too.
[01:20:24.008 --> 01:20:28.672]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[01:20:28.892 --> 01:20:32.815]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[01:20:32.936 --> 01:20:34.857]  Call the Ark Institute today, toll free, 1-800-255-1912.
[01:20:34.877 --> 01:20:35.898]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com.
[01:20:47.555 --> 01:20:52.778]  Waging War on Corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:58.061 --> 01:21:01.423]  Alright, let's go back to Wanda in Missouri and then Todd in Kansas and others.
[01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:03.784]  Go ahead, Wanda, you're on the air.
[01:21:03.804 --> 01:21:04.645]  Alright.
[01:21:05.285 --> 01:21:09.108]  Yes, while I was listening, I wrote down two questions.
[01:21:09.988 --> 01:21:10.268]  Okay.
[01:21:10.288 --> 01:21:11.909]  That I think should be considered.
[01:21:11.929 --> 01:21:13.050]  Number one,
[01:21:14.108 --> 01:21:15.249]  And the globalists
[01:21:45.143 --> 01:22:01.056]  See, that type of attitude is weak, but it was that loving, intelligent attitude, America's not perfect, but compared to other countries, it was heads above the rest with freedom, that created 4% of the world population having half the wealth.
[01:22:01.897 --> 01:22:08.922]  Because we had liberty, and where you have freedom, you have liberty, and you have plenty, and where you have tyranny, you have evil.
[01:22:09.283 --> 01:22:10.684]  Because the globalist use
[01:22:12.095 --> 01:22:13.896]  Use their control system.
[01:22:14.256 --> 01:22:15.317]  They want to degradate.
[01:22:15.337 --> 01:22:16.738]  They want to get us under their control.
[01:22:16.798 --> 01:22:17.658]  They want poverty.
[01:22:17.698 --> 01:22:18.599]  They want control.
[01:22:18.859 --> 01:22:19.879]  They're not our friends.
[01:22:19.919 --> 01:22:20.580]  Thanks for the call.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:27.864]  Before I go to Todd, let me hit this article, because I mentioned it, and it's online at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:22:28.244 --> 01:22:31.486]  Councilwoman Criticizes Action by Constables.
[01:22:32.446 --> 01:22:35.468]  This is out of the Morning Call online mainstream newspaper.
[01:22:37.279 --> 01:22:44.240]  They shot three dogs too fatally when they went to serve a warrant in Allentown for unpaid parking tickets.
[01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:58.083]  Saying there is a doozy of a problem here, Allentown Councilwoman Gail Hoover expressed outrage Sunday over the shooting of three dogs too fatally by constables serving a warrant on a man who had not paid parking tickets.
[01:23:00.083 --> 01:23:02.684]  These were parking violations, Hoover said Sunday.
[01:23:02.784 --> 01:23:03.384]  This was not
[01:23:04.262 --> 01:23:07.004]  Charles Manson who got out and we had to capture.
[01:23:07.024 --> 01:23:11.306]  This is a guy who didn't move his car on a street cleaner to get through.
[01:23:11.887 --> 01:23:22.613]  Hoover said she intends to speak with city police officials, Mayor Ron Afflerbach and State Representative Charles Dent today about the shooting and find out the status of the investigation.
[01:23:22.633 --> 01:23:29.777]  She wants to talk with Dent because constables are certified on the state level by the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency.
[01:23:30.287 --> 01:23:34.450]  According to Hoover, there is something wrong when shots are fired over parking tickets.
[01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:42.776]  It's just a system that has broken down somewhere here, said Hoover, who visited the home at 312 S. Franklin Street over the weekend.
[01:23:42.816 --> 01:23:48.340]  Constables were serving a warrant on Jeremiah Hartman Thursday when they shot the dogs.
[01:23:48.681 --> 01:23:56.026]  Hartman remained in the county prison Saturday, unable to post the $3,000 bail set by the District Justice Donna Butler.
[01:23:57.449 --> 01:23:58.810]  Now that's the amazing part.
[01:23:58.850 --> 01:24:06.857]  He didn't do anything, but there's a massive fine when they raided Eugene, Oregon neighborhood.
[01:24:06.897 --> 01:24:08.318]  The three houses at the end of the street.
[01:24:08.879 --> 01:24:09.760]  Blocked the road.
[01:24:10.772 --> 01:24:14.153]  And they drug the naked woman out by her hair, wearing a black ski mask.
[01:24:14.453 --> 01:24:16.474]  Three, four hours later, a school teacher comes out.
[01:24:16.874 --> 01:24:19.355]  May I back my car out and drive down the road?
[01:24:19.535 --> 01:24:21.095]  She couldn't get out because of blocking the road.
[01:24:21.735 --> 01:24:26.296]  And the cop just walks over to the news and says, I hadn't killed anybody in two weeks.
[01:24:26.356 --> 01:24:28.117]  I mean, how nuts is this getting?
[01:24:29.338 --> 01:24:33.344]  By the way, in Austin, the Austin SWAT team says they're on dog killing detail.
[01:24:33.745 --> 01:24:36.369]  The lead man, a dog gets up, a dog barks.
[01:24:36.890 --> 01:24:40.395]  It could be a Pomeranian, it could be a Rottweiler, a Bullmastiff.
[01:24:41.056 --> 01:24:42.579]  They shoot them!
[01:24:44.156 --> 01:24:47.600]  In Waco, they had caged Malamutes, basically Huskies.
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:24:48.460]  Caged.
[01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:49.241]  They shot them.
[01:24:49.622 --> 01:24:50.783]  Shot five puppies.
[01:24:51.283 --> 01:24:54.206]  Picked the baby dead dogs up and showed it to the children.
[01:24:54.607 --> 01:24:56.348]  This is psychopathic!
[01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:59.291]  They wear shirts called Natural Born Killers.
[01:24:59.351 --> 01:25:00.673]  Somebody gonna die!
[01:25:01.365 --> 01:25:03.167]  It was on Pastor Butch Paul's show last night.
[01:25:03.187 --> 01:25:05.529]  He said he was in a Mexican food restaurant for Mother's Day.
[01:25:05.909 --> 01:25:17.298]  There was a shaved head, giant, roid cop with huge arms, with handcuffs around the bicep, and on the back of his shirt it was a trooper leaning on a car and it said, All men are not created equal.
[01:25:17.458 --> 01:25:18.519]  Police are better.
[01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:23.984]  It's this ins... Somebody gonna... Somebody gonna die!
[01:25:25.330 --> 01:25:35.732]  The globalists can't give you tyranny until they get the millions they need, and now our government has announced they're going to hire felons for the military, including illegal alien felons who've committed aggravated assaults, according to the Washington Times.
[01:25:37.373 --> 01:25:38.573]  This is official.
[01:25:39.173 --> 01:25:44.514]  People separate from the country to enforce this, just like Stalin releasing criminals to enforce it.
[01:25:46.275 --> 01:25:51.896]  It said the dog that survived the shooting remained in a veterinary hospital, waiting for surgery to remove the bullets, Hoover said.
[01:25:52.734 --> 01:25:58.118]  But the surgery won't be done until the vet receives $2,000 down payment, said Hoover, who was trying to raise the money through donations.
[01:25:58.519 --> 01:25:59.980]  Something has to be done, Hoover said.
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:03.783]  I don't... What kind of weird vet is this that won't just do the surgery?
[01:26:04.864 --> 01:26:05.344]  So sick.
[01:26:05.364 --> 01:26:06.645]  Something has to be done, Hoover said.
[01:26:06.685 --> 01:26:07.265]  I don't care.
[01:26:07.285 --> 01:26:09.647]  They had 100 parking tickets.
[01:26:09.867 --> 01:26:12.610]  Thank God one of those shots didn't ricochet and hit one of the people.
[01:26:13.230 --> 01:26:16.112]  It's a lousy parking thing and it turns out 11 shots have been fired.
[01:26:16.773 --> 01:26:20.636]  There were three children in the adjoining room and other residents nearby when the shots were fired.
[01:26:21.423 --> 01:26:25.864]  And they've grabbed the man, they're charging him with the maximum fines and keeping him in jail.
[01:26:26.325 --> 01:26:31.586]  See, they arrested people for potting soil in the last raid with the Army in Portland.
[01:26:33.047 --> 01:26:33.947]  We're on the march.
[01:26:34.427 --> 01:26:36.048]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.968 --> 01:26:39.649]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:43.047 --> 01:26:46.069]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:26:46.389 --> 01:26:51.312]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:26:51.572 --> 01:26:53.393]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled.
[01:26:53.413 --> 01:26:53.693]  The call is 877-605-9200.
[01:26:53.713 --> 01:26:53.893]  That's 877-605-9200.
[01:26:53.913 --> 01:26:56.195]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:10.527 --> 01:27:12.909]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:27:14.890 --> 01:27:33.020]  Every two or three days, I see articles of SWAT teams killing their own officers, killing citizens, and you only hear about it in the news, in the regional news, and we scan all the regional news around the country, or much of it, you can't physically look at all of it.
[01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:38.964]  You only hear about it when it's an innocent person, or they shoot a little kid, blow some 12-year-old in half.
[01:27:40.217 --> 01:27:43.698]  I want you to have an image of small children's intestines blown all over the walls.
[01:27:44.118 --> 01:27:45.478]  You're like, oh, don't bring that up.
[01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:48.499]  I want you to know what this tyranny does, folks.
[01:27:48.539 --> 01:27:50.139]  Imagine making a movie about this.
[01:27:50.959 --> 01:27:52.440]  How mad you'd be at the police.
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:55.400]  And you know, the cops have been brainwashed.
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:56.540]  They've been trained how to do this.
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:27:57.681]  This all came out of L.A.
[01:27:57.721 --> 01:28:00.061]  when the CIA set these SWAT teams up.
[01:28:00.081 --> 01:28:04.382]  Before I go to Todd and Ken and others that are patiently holding
[01:28:06.337 --> 01:28:08.459]  Two little announcements, important announcements.
[01:28:08.579 --> 01:28:16.965]  I'll be in Kansas City for a rare appearance this Saturday from 10 a.m.
[01:28:17.585 --> 01:28:19.226]  until about 7 at night.
[01:28:19.247 --> 01:28:21.148]  I'll be speaking for two hours and taking questions.
[01:28:21.188 --> 01:28:25.331]  Colonel Greg Roberts will be speaking for a couple hours, doing a PowerPoint presentation.
[01:28:25.351 --> 01:28:26.252]  I'll be doing one as well.
[01:28:26.272 --> 01:28:28.513]  Scott Miller's going to be there talking.
[01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:29.374]  He's going to have a booth.
[01:28:30.367 --> 01:28:31.148]  Kansas City.
[01:28:31.208 --> 01:28:33.309]  It's a benefit for KCXL Radio.
[01:28:33.329 --> 01:28:34.790]  1140 AM.
[01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:36.391]  Been on there about three years.
[01:28:37.251 --> 01:28:39.292]  Been begging me for two to come up there, so I'm going.
[01:28:40.153 --> 01:28:41.734]  And May 17, 2003.
[01:28:41.834 --> 01:28:43.875]  10 AM to 630 PM.
[01:28:44.876 --> 01:28:47.357]  And it's the Blue Ridge Mall Expo Center.
[01:28:47.377 --> 01:28:49.558]  5200 Blue Ridge Boulevard.
[01:28:49.578 --> 01:28:53.180]  Between I-70, between Kansas City and Independence, Missouri.
[01:28:54.041 --> 01:28:55.842]  And we really look forward to folks being there.
[01:28:55.882 --> 01:28:55.982]  It's $15.
[01:28:57.865 --> 01:29:01.908]  And you need to get your tickets beforehand from KCXL, or I guess you can get them at the door.
[01:29:04.330 --> 01:29:05.931]  And that goes to, of course, paid for.
[01:29:06.052 --> 01:29:07.613]  The place holds 8,000.
[01:29:07.713 --> 01:29:09.694]  I think we'll probably have about 1,000 there.
[01:29:10.475 --> 01:29:14.458]  But it goes to support KCXL.
[01:29:14.618 --> 01:29:16.680]  All the proceeds do, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:16.720 --> 01:29:21.964]  Great folks reaching hundreds of thousands of people, really millions over the years, that have tuned into the station.
[01:29:23.025 --> 01:29:26.787]  Uh, goes all the way out to even the surrounding cities, not just Kansas City.
[01:29:26.847 --> 01:29:27.607]  Great signal.
[01:29:28.227 --> 01:29:31.389]  Doing a great job and, uh, carry the daytime show.
[01:29:31.429 --> 01:29:32.649]  We really appreciate that.
[01:29:32.929 --> 01:29:34.450]  Well, they carry two hours of the show.
[01:29:34.470 --> 01:29:37.831]  They need to carry all three of the daytime, but that's alright.
[01:29:38.912 --> 01:29:43.814]  And, uh, I'll be... I'll be up there with Colonel Roberts and others doing some great presentations.
[01:29:44.294 --> 01:29:45.374]  You want to call the station.
[01:29:45.414 --> 01:29:45.595]  It's 816-792-1140.
[01:29:51.615 --> 01:29:52.196]  816-792-1140.
[01:29:52.216 --> 01:29:57.939]  And that's how you get in touch with them.
[01:29:57.959 --> 01:30:03.663]  You can also call their bookstore at 816-836-7474.
[01:30:04.464 --> 01:30:10.428]  And I will be offering my new video, Police Day 3, Total Enslavement, there.
[01:30:11.448 --> 01:30:17.152]  So that's also a great place for you to drop by and get that, as well as my other titles and my book, from Civil Colonel Roberts.
[01:30:18.426 --> 01:30:21.729]  So that's the Blue Ridge Mall Expo Center this Saturday in Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:30:21.749 --> 01:30:32.479]  If you don't live in Kansas City, or in Kansas, or in Missouri, and you aren't coming to the event, you ought to get my videos.
[01:30:32.759 --> 01:30:42.528]  I have now produced Police State 3, Total Enslavement, The Greatest Evil That Mankind Has Ever Faces Among Us, A Scientifically Crafted Global Dictatorship,
[01:30:44.654 --> 01:30:52.859]  Sworn to enslave every man, woman, and child, the United States government, at all levels, has fallen under the control of the desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[01:30:53.299 --> 01:31:01.704]  The events of September 11th mark the initiation of the final sick push of the Illuminati to consolidate their One World Order and transform Earth into a prison planet.
[01:31:02.124 --> 01:31:11.870]  In over two and a half hours, I chronicle in stunning detail the true character of the Globalist, learning to master a plan for the bloodthirsty elite that financially, physically, and spiritually imprison
[01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:14.311]  Not only America, but the world.
[01:31:14.691 --> 01:31:20.914]  Total Enslavement is the third installment in my critically acclaimed Police State series, and is a must-see for all who love freedom.
[01:31:21.274 --> 01:31:32.318]  The film documents the nightmare rise of Homeland Security dictatorship, Patriot Act 1 and 2, the Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison surveillance economy, and much more.
[01:31:32.699 --> 01:31:40.682]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism, and how the globalists pose as our saviors, when in fact, they are the terrorists.
[01:31:42.463 --> 01:31:45.786]  We don't get into 9-1-1 like Road to Tyranny and Masters of Terror.
[01:31:45.846 --> 01:31:48.488]  It's all other examples of government-sponsored terror.
[01:31:49.629 --> 01:31:52.472]  Their plan, where they're going, a lot of key stuff.
[01:31:52.512 --> 01:31:53.733]  You really need to get the video.
[01:31:53.793 --> 01:31:55.835]  It's 2 hours and 37 minutes.
[01:31:55.995 --> 01:31:57.897]  I suggest you watch an hour a night.
[01:31:59.221 --> 01:32:12.471]  An hour the first night, an hour another night, or have friends over, say on a Friday, have another meeting the next Friday, show it again, and then show the last 37 minutes of the next Friday, and talk about it, go to the computer, check the news articles and documents.
[01:32:13.095 --> 01:32:18.279]  That are in the film, almost all of them are on the websites, PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:32:18.739 --> 01:32:21.361]  Get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:32:21.541 --> 01:32:26.805]  It's $25.95, but if you order 3 or more of any of my 9 films, they drop down to $20 a piece.
[01:32:27.166 --> 01:32:27.926]  My book is only $12.
[01:32:29.187 --> 01:32:30.969]  Make the call today at 1-888-253-3139
[01:32:39.176 --> 01:32:59.746]  That's 888-253-3139 or infowars.com or net to order or just write to me and I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, LAMAR, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:33:01.667 --> 01:33:06.930]  By facing the horrible truth we can resist the New World Order and get our Constitutional Republic back.
[01:33:07.598 --> 01:33:12.142]  Make the call, write the letter, go online and order the films, the books, today!
[01:33:14.023 --> 01:33:29.016]  I know we've got some calls, and I keep getting requests, we air this a couple times a month, to re-air Renegades, and I had to remember to tell Mark to cue that up, but we're going to air Renegades here in a few minutes after I go to some of these calls.
[01:33:29.676 --> 01:33:32.258]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Kansas.
[01:33:32.679 --> 01:33:34.160]  Tom, you're on the air, welcome sir.
[01:33:38.762 --> 01:33:45.325]  Have you ever had the chance to read the book Against All Hope by Armando Valadares?
[01:33:46.345 --> 01:33:47.065]  No, I haven't.
[01:33:47.746 --> 01:33:54.749]  That book deals with Valadares spending 22 years in Castro's gulags.
[01:33:56.502 --> 01:34:05.787]  You know, with this Patriot Act and what you reported last week of dragging the couples out with flashbang grenades and bags over their heads, it prompted me to read that book again.
[01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:23.537]  With the Patriot Act and all this homeland revolution garbage, it's just exactly like you said, a textbook tyranny of just how bad it can get if a person would read that book and see just exactly
[01:34:24.119 --> 01:34:35.719]  What they do with political prisoners, which a lot of people would be, according to the wording of... Well, when a lot of the SWAT teams are wearing shirts saying, somebody gonna die, we're better than you...
[01:34:37.009 --> 01:34:39.991]  I've talked to people whose children are now on SWAT teams.
[01:34:40.011 --> 01:34:48.237]  They train them to go, us, they put their thumb towards their chest, and them, and they point at the American people with their middle finger.
[01:34:48.557 --> 01:34:49.037]  Well, yeah.
[01:34:49.398 --> 01:34:50.298]  I tell ya.
[01:34:50.498 --> 01:34:52.620]  Did you hear about the Marine Corps chant they have now?
[01:34:52.640 --> 01:34:57.423]  This is in the mainstream news, where they chant about lining children up and mowing them down.
[01:34:57.603 --> 01:35:04.028]  Yeah, I heard you saying that, I don't know, it's been three or four months ago you was talking about that.
[01:35:04.895 --> 01:35:07.556]  You know, that would be no different than, you know, Castro.
[01:35:07.596 --> 01:35:08.297]  He was put in.
[01:35:08.957 --> 01:35:11.538]  He was put in and... By the CIA!
[01:35:11.598 --> 01:35:12.058]  Well, sure.
[01:35:12.098 --> 01:35:14.339]  He came in as a lion, Trojan horse, too.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:19.922]  And, uh, he ate up a lot of the people that helped him along.
[01:35:20.842 --> 01:35:21.803]  Well, they need to know that.
[01:35:21.863 --> 01:35:26.865]  People in government need to make the decisions and at least passively not go along with the enemy combatants.
[01:35:26.985 --> 01:35:27.345]  Well, sure.
[01:35:27.385 --> 01:35:31.247]  They'd stick them right into a political prisoner, uh, prison system.
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:35.122]  And uh... you get a whole lot worse than carrying a bucket of coke.
[01:35:35.142 --> 01:35:37.403]  Well, you know, America's a big complex country.
[01:35:37.443 --> 01:35:40.264]  There's still a lot of separation of power between the states.
[01:35:40.304 --> 01:35:47.267]  Did you know, I'm driving along last night listening to AP Network News on News Talk 1260 KWNX station I'm on locally.
[01:35:48.348 --> 01:35:51.650]  So I was filling in for their drive time host who's in the hospital having surgery.
[01:35:52.650 --> 01:35:56.552]  And I'm driving along listening when I left to the 7 o'clock news or whatever.
[01:35:57.773 --> 01:36:00.494]  And I'm listening and they said that the
[01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:11.809]  That the Governor, with the Speaker of the House, has ordered the arrest of over 80 members of the Legislature.
[01:36:13.150 --> 01:36:21.217]  And I'm listening, no I'm not kidding, I'm listening to them reading this AP headline, national headline,
[01:36:21.903 --> 01:36:35.286]  Because they say they've been ordered, basically under Homeland Security, to follow all orders, to vote as they're told, by Washington, and then you hear this state rep from Houston saying, they're taking over, we won't be part of this, and that's all it said.
[01:36:35.326 --> 01:36:37.447]  We don't know what they're talking about.
[01:36:37.467 --> 01:36:42.488]  I typed in the article, it popped up, it just said they've been ordered to be arrested.
[01:36:42.989 --> 01:36:52.345]  See, and I'm so conditioned in this la-la land that I'm hearing that members of the House have been ordered in the Senate to be arrested.
[01:36:54.794 --> 01:36:55.695]  I don't know how you do it.
[01:36:56.475 --> 01:36:59.737]  In fact, people are listening right now in Texas who heard this.
[01:37:00.238 --> 01:37:01.679]  It was on National AP News.
[01:37:02.139 --> 01:37:05.321]  Whole end of the show, if you heard it, why I didn't print that article.
[01:37:05.361 --> 01:37:06.962]  I read it online last night when I got home.
[01:37:07.323 --> 01:37:07.903]  Didn't print it.
[01:37:07.923 --> 01:37:08.463]  Didn't cover it.
[01:37:08.844 --> 01:37:10.365]  I can't keep track of it anymore.
[01:37:10.465 --> 01:37:11.485]  Well, I know one thing.
[01:37:12.326 --> 01:37:20.832]  Me and my wife just can't understand how you can do it because we watch five or six minutes of this local news and got to leave the room because they're just about ready to throw up.
[01:37:21.192 --> 01:37:24.034]  I mean, you just can't handle it and we've had these
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:33.347]  Tornadoes come ripping through here and all of a sudden you've got troops in some of these towns picking off local people because they're not used to that.
[01:37:33.407 --> 01:37:38.712]  You've got FEMA setting up an office down here wanting to know your income, your social security number.
[01:37:39.172 --> 01:37:43.716]  I mean, and you try to explain to some people... Yeah, we always had emergencies.
[01:37:43.796 --> 01:37:45.117]  Why is everything the military?
[01:37:45.337 --> 01:37:47.039]  Why is everything oppression now?
[01:37:47.359 --> 01:37:48.560]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:51.743]  And what they were talking about, you recall it before, about a business
[01:37:52.461 --> 01:37:53.462]  Everything's a business.
[01:37:53.502 --> 01:38:03.311]  This is just a gigantic corporate... They admit that with the red light cameras it causes a doubling in deaths from Baltimore to San Diego.
[01:38:03.351 --> 01:38:04.672]  They took it out in San Diego.
[01:38:05.013 --> 01:38:09.337]  They shorten the lights and they say we don't care if it kills you.
[01:38:09.637 --> 01:38:11.339]  We make lots of money off this.
[01:38:11.539 --> 01:38:13.641]  And they claim the states are bankrupt and they gotta do it.
[01:38:13.841 --> 01:38:14.742]  The states aren't bankrupt.
[01:38:14.762 --> 01:38:15.823]  They got two sets of books.
[01:38:15.903 --> 01:38:16.363]  Well sure.
[01:38:17.404 --> 01:38:19.226]  That's what we say.
[01:38:19.306 --> 01:38:20.126]  They got lots of money.
[01:38:20.346 --> 01:38:28.232]  The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report is the double set of books for counties, water districts, cities, states, the feds, everybody.
[01:38:28.493 --> 01:38:33.016]  Well, I'll tell you what, Alex, if you get a chance to read that, Against All Hope, do it.
[01:38:33.136 --> 01:38:34.937]  It's pretty awesome of what they've experienced.
[01:38:34.957 --> 01:38:39.501]  Well, we've had Cuban-Americans on this show who thought everything was good when Castro first got in.
[01:38:39.521 --> 01:38:40.902]  The news said he was good at first.
[01:38:41.222 --> 01:38:43.284]  They fly back and get arrested at the airport.
[01:38:43.504 --> 01:38:45.986]  They take your kids when you get off the plane and put them in a
[01:38:46.486 --> 01:38:48.306]  Yeah, that's the whole thing.
[01:38:48.326 --> 01:38:50.067]  They're just eating up their own.
[01:38:50.847 --> 01:38:51.867]  But it's amazing.
[01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:54.628]  It's textbook, like you say.
[01:38:54.908 --> 01:38:57.908]  And it's coming on to be a huge scale here.
[01:38:58.008 --> 01:39:03.450]  I challenge police, especially SWAT team members, to read a textbook about Germany, Russia, Cuba, China.
[01:39:03.690 --> 01:39:04.690]  It's you, folks.
[01:39:04.770 --> 01:39:05.210]  It's you.
[01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.910]  Exactly.
[01:39:05.950 --> 01:39:08.411]  And they're counting on us being ignorant and going along with it.
[01:39:08.431 --> 01:39:09.051]  We're not going to do it.
[01:39:09.071 --> 01:39:09.571]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:10.492 --> 01:39:10.972]  Appreciate it.
[01:39:11.352 --> 01:39:14.694]  Ken in Fort Worth, and then we're going to air that song.
[01:39:14.734 --> 01:39:15.855]  Go ahead, Ken, you're on the air.
[01:39:16.295 --> 01:39:22.658]  Alex, my state representative, Lon Burnham, is AWOL from the Texas Legislature up in Ardmore, Oklahoma Republic.
[01:39:22.698 --> 01:39:23.299]  Now that's it.
[01:39:23.439 --> 01:39:26.740]  Now tell them, did you hear about how they ordered the arrest of them?
[01:39:27.141 --> 01:39:27.461]  Yeah.
[01:39:27.761 --> 01:39:28.701]  Hey, but tell you what happened.
[01:39:28.821 --> 01:39:29.622]  No, stop.
[01:39:29.722 --> 01:39:30.302]  Tell them about it.
[01:39:30.582 --> 01:39:31.483]  I'm listening to the news.
[01:39:31.803 --> 01:39:34.524]  They said they're going to arrest all these members of the House.
[01:39:34.564 --> 01:39:34.905]  Go ahead.
[01:39:35.005 --> 01:39:35.905]  Right, if they can find them.
[01:39:36.946 --> 01:39:39.607]  But they went up to the Oklahoma Republic to hide.
[01:39:40.086 --> 01:39:53.688]  But what they did is, people don't know, maybe nobody told them, that the Texas went Republican the first time in 100 years, and the last time it was every 10 years they have to redistrict, and they redistrict under a Democratic rule.
[01:39:53.708 --> 01:39:59.289]  Now Tom DeLay says, hey, let's do it again under a Republican rule, and those guys went AWOL on a lamb.
[01:40:00.430 --> 01:40:01.210]  They took off.
[01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:06.071]  Now the head of the Texas legislature told the state police to go pick them up.
[01:40:06.111 --> 01:40:07.511]  I guess they picked one of them up here.
[01:40:09.339 --> 01:40:10.472]  Yeah, go arrest them!
[01:40:10.795 --> 01:40:11.038]  Yeah!
[01:40:11.644 --> 01:40:14.066]  Well, look, I'm not for the Democrats and you know that, Ken.
[01:40:14.146 --> 01:40:19.090]  I've given money to the Republicans and everything else, but these Republicans in the House are just the same as the Democrats.
[01:40:19.431 --> 01:40:20.652]  They're a bunch of gun grabbers.
[01:40:20.672 --> 01:40:22.553]  Have you seen all the gun bills in the legislature?
[01:40:22.713 --> 01:40:23.454]  In the Texas one?
[01:40:23.754 --> 01:40:23.994]  Yeah.
[01:40:24.175 --> 01:40:25.095]  Not really, no.
[01:40:25.536 --> 01:40:28.338]  There probably are, but I don't think anything's going to happen with Republicans in control.
[01:40:28.358 --> 01:40:28.738]  I don't know.
[01:40:28.758 --> 01:40:29.399]  Are you kidding?
[01:40:29.439 --> 01:40:32.361]  It almost did last time until I caught bribery going on.
[01:40:32.642 --> 01:40:32.842]  Yeah.
[01:40:33.042 --> 01:40:34.703]  You remember when I caught the bribery on tape?
[01:40:35.044 --> 01:40:35.244]  Yeah.
[01:40:35.764 --> 01:40:36.445]  All over the news?
[01:40:36.645 --> 01:40:37.406]  Yeah, you've got to watch them.
[01:40:37.426 --> 01:40:38.006]  I don't care who they are.
[01:40:38.026 --> 01:40:39.908]  And I got attacked for catching bribery on tape.
[01:40:40.961 --> 01:40:45.945]  I think the governor ought to just fire all those guys or some way and get all the Republicans who lost to go up there and do the voting.
[01:40:47.166 --> 01:40:55.252]  Yeah, you're getting sucked into that.
[01:40:55.372 --> 01:40:55.693]  You know what?
[01:40:55.733 --> 01:40:56.934]  They should go filibuster.
[01:40:56.974 --> 01:40:58.375]  They shouldn't run away.
[01:40:58.395 --> 01:40:58.855]  No!
[01:40:59.856 --> 01:41:05.380]  Driving along, all I hear is, on AP News, there's been an order to arrest all these members.
[01:41:06.701 --> 01:41:07.842]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:41:07.962 --> 01:41:09.503]  And they say it's a federal takeover.
[01:41:09.543 --> 01:41:10.104]  That's all I heard.
[01:41:10.589 --> 01:41:17.152]  Yeah, but the Republicans who lost the races to these guys ought to go down there and stand in front of the house and say, I'll do it if he don't!
[01:41:19.153 --> 01:41:19.413]  Right?
[01:41:19.773 --> 01:41:21.514]  Yeah, I hear you.
[01:41:22.234 --> 01:41:23.055]  Ken, anything else?
[01:41:24.916 --> 01:41:25.636]  Anything else, Ken?
[01:41:26.757 --> 01:41:34.100]  Today in the Texas Senate hearing, they got the guys who own the newspapers and the television stations.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.241]  Maybe you're watching some of it.
[01:41:35.861 --> 01:41:38.142]  What are they doing trying to get the regulations off of them?
[01:41:38.735 --> 01:41:39.955]  I don't know, but anyway, it's good.
[01:41:40.075 --> 01:41:42.156]  Exposure's good for everybody, you know.
[01:41:42.436 --> 01:41:44.437]  But they ask the guy, how many stations are you guys?
[01:41:44.457 --> 01:41:44.977]  He's like, 115.
[01:41:45.017 --> 01:41:46.597]  You know, why so many?
[01:41:46.617 --> 01:41:50.439]  Two or three or four or five.
[01:41:50.459 --> 01:41:51.479]  100-some, why so many?
[01:41:51.719 --> 01:41:55.460]  I like to look at their faces when they ask him these questions.
[01:41:56.152 --> 01:42:00.134]  Well, look, I mean, if somebody owns a hundred stations of small potatoes, that's no problem.
[01:42:00.434 --> 01:42:01.895]  But all they do is control!
[01:42:02.215 --> 01:42:05.076]  Yeah, but we'd have hundreds and hundreds of owners.
[01:42:05.716 --> 01:42:07.297]  You know, they all just own a hundred.
[01:42:07.337 --> 01:42:11.439]  The problem is that 3rd Channel already owns half and is in the back pocket of the government.
[01:42:11.699 --> 01:42:12.540]  Thanks for the call, Ken.
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.601]  Yeah, it's pretty serious business.
[01:42:16.942 --> 01:42:21.904]  Alright, we got this song for you folks, and it's Renegades.
[01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:25.414]  Now, what we'll do is we'll air it in the next segment, then.
[01:42:25.454 --> 01:42:26.076]  Is that cool, Mark?
[01:42:26.917 --> 01:42:27.418]  Can we do that?
[01:42:27.438 --> 01:42:27.799]  Okay.
[01:42:28.481 --> 01:42:31.567]  Let me go ahead, and we've just had a lot of requests for this song, and we'll...
[01:42:32.495 --> 01:42:33.536]  Blair it again for you.
[01:42:34.076 --> 01:42:35.577]  Some of the other news.
[01:42:35.677 --> 01:42:37.338]  Saudi bombing deaths rise.
[01:42:37.358 --> 01:42:40.401]  200 injured, at least 29 killed.
[01:42:41.281 --> 01:42:49.867]  Right in conjunction with all these terror drills, they're running here and with his lordship, the head of the State Department, landing, Colin Powell.
[01:42:50.368 --> 01:42:52.069]  Now they're saying up to 50 dead.
[01:42:52.229 --> 01:42:53.029]  No one really knows.
[01:42:53.049 --> 01:42:54.310]  I've got all these different articles.
[01:42:54.731 --> 01:42:56.512]  They're saying 40 Americans could be dead.
[01:42:56.532 --> 01:42:57.673]  Now they're saying 10 dead.
[01:42:58.213 --> 01:42:59.314]  Everybody's saying something different.
[01:42:59.334 --> 01:43:00.815]  We'll find out by tonight or tomorrow.
[01:43:02.546 --> 01:43:06.432]  And, uh, Senator Graham charges Bush cover-up on terror facts.
[01:43:06.833 --> 01:43:08.916]  Funny, Graham was the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[01:43:09.297 --> 01:43:10.960]  Graham met with General
[01:43:12.354 --> 01:43:18.678]  The general of the Pakistani intelligence, the guy that wired all the money to Adda, this is just politicking.
[01:43:19.039 --> 01:43:23.541]  They're demanding that Bush release the whitewash investigation, that nothing will be found in that.
[01:43:24.082 --> 01:43:33.068]  The former chairman and now a ranking member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence cited the final report, the bipartisan House-Senate inquiry into the events, beginning September 11th, completed five months ago.
[01:43:33.088 --> 01:43:41.453]  The report is said to provide detailed information on activities leading up to the attacks, raises serious policy questions, but the administration has refused to publicly release the report.
[01:43:42.347 --> 01:43:44.969]  Yeah, because it shows prior knowledge in spades.
[01:43:45.009 --> 01:43:46.310]  It's a lot worse than prior knowledge.
[01:43:46.831 --> 01:43:56.059]  By continuing to classify the information that is not available to the American people, the American people have been denied important information for their own protection from the protection of the communities.
[01:43:56.139 --> 01:44:00.783]  Local agencies have been denied information which would help them be more effective at first responders.
[01:44:00.803 --> 01:44:01.743]  So it's a whitewash.
[01:44:02.284 --> 01:44:05.647]  Toronto Star came right out and basically says the government did it.
[01:44:07.028 --> 01:44:10.531]  And I'm going to try to read this whole article in the next hour because it's so interesting.
[01:44:11.405 --> 01:44:12.585]  By Michael Landsberg.
[01:44:12.605 --> 01:44:15.726]  Conspiracy Crusader Dallas Official 9-1-1 Version.
[01:44:16.106 --> 01:44:19.907]  I mean, I'm seeing a lot of mainstream stuff worldwide saying the globalists did it.
[01:44:21.247 --> 01:44:22.947]  And we'll get into the don't panic.
[01:44:23.487 --> 01:44:25.768]  This drill may save lives.
[01:44:26.468 --> 01:44:31.969]  And the big brainwashing going on with the drills that are happening around the country.
[01:44:32.009 --> 01:44:33.309]  These FEMA takeover drills.
[01:44:33.369 --> 01:44:36.110]  Got a bunch of Second Amendment news we haven't gotten to.
[01:44:36.170 --> 01:44:37.630]  Just, oh man, so much.

[01:45:03.917 --> 01:45:10.743]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.

[01:48:13.806 --> 01:48:23.832]  From Nazareth he came with a ragtag band to bring a revolution.
[01:48:26.994 --> 01:48:33.117]  Some would make him king, others couldn't stand for that.
[01:48:33.137 --> 01:48:38.981]  The cross was a solution, but he rose again.
[01:48:40.934 --> 01:48:45.416]  Wise men follow him, they will lose again.
[01:48:46.997 --> 01:48:52.580]  Wise men follow him, thank God for the renegade.
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:57.703]  And the lives they lead, for the heroes.

[01:49:31.195 --> 01:49:34.237]  Declaring independence.
[01:49:37.359 --> 01:49:40.541]  Lay their bodies down.
[01:49:41.042 --> 01:49:42.242]  On a bloody wall.
[01:49:43.483 --> 01:49:46.485]  A liberty for their descendants.

[01:50:15.826 --> 01:50:22.249]  4% of the world population wouldn't have 40 plus percent of the wealth.
[01:50:22.289 --> 01:50:26.851]  We're losing it all now to a criminal cabal known as the New World Order.
[01:50:26.891 --> 01:50:27.831]  Let's go to Jeremy
[01:50:40.450 --> 01:50:45.112]  Uh, in Indiana, then Wyatt and others, and then I'll get into all this other news in the third and final hour.
[01:50:45.552 --> 01:50:47.113]  Go ahead, Jeremy, you're on the air.
[01:50:47.373 --> 01:50:53.295]  Yeah, I was wondering, Alex, if you happened to get the helicopters that were over your house into the police state three or not.
[01:50:54.396 --> 01:51:01.699]  No, I didn't, because, uh, again, I walked out and the drone flew over, and then I got the camera, and it's just a helicopter flying in circles around my house.
[01:51:01.719 --> 01:51:07.761]  Uh, it's what the APD does, uh, and they're based out of the airport with the army that's admitted.
[01:51:08.852 --> 01:51:12.304]  Okay, I was curious, I got like three real quick items also.
[01:51:12.705 --> 01:51:14.271]  Did you hear about the FBI checks?
[01:51:14.904 --> 01:51:20.747]  Need it due to the dumb Homeland Security bill, which I'm assuming would be the Patriot Act.
[01:51:21.087 --> 01:51:24.609]  You have to get an FBI check to send off fireworks on the 4th of July.
[01:51:25.009 --> 01:51:35.335]  Oh yeah, there's going to be, look, every business, food service, agriculture, new layers of taxes, regulators in your lives, the guns will be more regulated, it's all in S22.
[01:51:35.675 --> 01:51:40.818]  Patriot Act 2 has been introduced in the Senate with added gun control.
[01:51:41.866 --> 01:51:44.748]  Well, yeah, a friend of mine used to do fireworks out here.
[01:51:44.768 --> 01:51:49.710]  He used to do the shows, and he's not doing it this year because they told him he has to do an FBI background check.
[01:51:49.971 --> 01:52:00.817]  Well, more than that, Estes Rockets and others are about to go out of business because, you know, the little toy rockets we all, our dads got us as kids, you can't ship those through the mail.
[01:52:01.497 --> 01:52:03.618]  It's total control, total tyranny.
[01:52:05.639 --> 01:52:06.760]  I can't understand.
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:08.941]  Well, I do understand it, and I don't understand it.
[01:52:08.981 --> 01:52:10.062]  I can't understand why people
[01:52:10.731 --> 01:52:11.412]  Let this happen.
[01:52:12.913 --> 01:52:14.354]  One other major item.
[01:52:14.554 --> 01:52:21.200]  I had heard a rumor, and I'd like to know if you heard anything about it, that gentleman may have been speaking about TV stations.
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:26.264]  I heard Fox, ABC, and NBC are all consolidating under one megacorporation.
[01:52:26.364 --> 01:52:27.225]  Oh, they already did.
[01:52:27.545 --> 01:52:30.127]  Three years ago, their news gathering is in network
[01:52:30.905 --> 01:52:31.145]  Well...
[01:52:54.142 --> 01:52:57.145]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:52:57.465 --> 01:53:02.409]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:53:02.650 --> 01:53:05.152]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they have been hit.
[01:53:08.895 --> 01:53:12.078]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.622 --> 01:53:20.262]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.922 --> 01:53:21.963]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.683 --> 01:53:23.783]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.444 --> 01:53:25.264]  You want answers?
[01:53:26.024 --> 01:53:26.904]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.924 --> 01:53:31.326]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.786 --> 01:53:35.827]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:38.268 --> 01:53:41.009]  The globalists have made a list, they're checking it twice.
[01:53:41.630 --> 01:53:44.751]  Everything it takes to set up a dictatorship of tyranny.
[01:53:45.352 --> 01:53:53.056]  Not a dictatorship of Al Gore, John Kerry, or George Bush, but a dictatorship of the military-industrial complex owned by the private banks.
[01:53:53.596 --> 01:53:57.218]  While we're busy debating Republican-Democrat, Liberal-Conservative,
[01:53:58.104 --> 01:54:06.507]  Green, Libertarian, the Globalists are busy deconstructing America and shutting up a textbook slave state.
[01:54:06.547 --> 01:54:12.489]  Coming up, I want to read this article, Conspiracy Crusader Doubts Official Version of 9-1-1.
[01:54:13.509 --> 01:54:23.773]  I want to get into some of the terror drills the Feds are running to condition us to accept slavery, the terrible bombings that took place overnight in Saudi Arabia,
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:28.241]  Look at who has the motive for that and has been involved in past bombings in Saudi Arabia.
[01:54:28.781 --> 01:54:32.742]  This ridiculous lawsuit seeks to ban the sale of Oreos to children in California.
[01:54:33.182 --> 01:54:33.522]  Hey!
[01:54:34.382 --> 01:54:38.243]  You're next, food manufacturers, big corporations that give money to the gun grabbers.
[01:54:39.803 --> 01:54:40.643]  You're in deep trouble.
[01:54:41.744 --> 01:54:44.324]  You thought you could selectively sue the gun manufacturers out of business.
[01:54:44.564 --> 01:54:47.165]  What about if a drunk runs over somebody in a Ford Expedition?
[01:54:47.345 --> 01:54:48.725]  You gonna sue Ford?
[01:54:49.696 --> 01:54:50.597]  This is the new system.
[01:54:50.937 --> 01:54:52.759]  It's all coming up in this hour.
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:55.962]  Right now, let's go to Wyatt in Maryland and Don in Texas and others.
[01:54:56.403 --> 01:54:58.284]  Wyatt in Maryland, go ahead, sir.
[01:54:58.304 --> 01:54:59.666]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:54:59.726 --> 01:55:00.086]  Pretty good.
[01:55:00.767 --> 01:55:01.548]  Good.
[01:55:01.628 --> 01:55:07.994]  Yeah, with this situation with the dirty bomb experiment or exercise in Seattle,
[01:55:08.399 --> 01:55:14.343]  And then you have a terrorist attack, or whatever they want to call it, in Saudi Arabia.
[01:55:15.064 --> 01:55:16.985]  Just so happens that's coincidental.
[01:55:17.045 --> 01:55:20.888]  Then you're having a staged biochemical attack in Chicago.
[01:55:21.228 --> 01:55:26.392]  With hundreds of actors, thousands of actors, creating the illusion it's real, having the same effect.
[01:55:26.933 --> 01:55:27.133]  Right.
[01:55:27.473 --> 01:55:31.216]  And more vile footage for the media to show us to scare us.
[01:55:31.676 --> 01:55:31.916]  Right.
[01:55:32.196 --> 01:55:35.459]  And on the local news here, there's a report that
[01:55:36.998 --> 01:55:44.624]  The Army Corps of Engineers are going to drain a swamp up in Frederick County around Fort Detrick.
[01:55:45.024 --> 01:55:56.654]  They're saying that they think that whoever did the anthrax walked into the swamp with some kind of submersible equipment to do these envelopes.
[01:55:58.066 --> 01:56:00.468]  That was proposed by the head of Washington, D.C.
[01:56:00.488 --> 01:56:06.653]  The most weaponized anthrax ever seen, with Bush in his cabinet on Cipro, even before 9-1-1.
[01:56:07.433 --> 01:56:14.599]  The most weaponized form ever seen, sent to members of Congress to help shut down Congress so they could pass the Patriot Act when the whole place is basically shut down.
[01:56:14.619 --> 01:56:19.102]  And now, yeah, I heard them, oh, they submerged it and made the stuff underwater.
[01:56:19.122 --> 01:56:20.363]  Yeah, in a slump.
[01:56:20.771 --> 01:56:22.632]  Now, here they're going to drain this swamp.
[01:56:22.792 --> 01:56:23.693]  It's all wetlands.
[01:56:23.773 --> 01:56:24.874]  It's natural wetlands.
[01:56:24.954 --> 01:56:34.900]  Now, if you would do that, or the property owner would do that, they'd throw you in jail for a violation of some federal Gestapo act.
[01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:37.502]  But they're going to do it, and it's okay.
[01:56:37.522 --> 01:56:43.626]  Now, what in the world do they think that they're going to... Well, I don't know what they'll plant, but I don't know what they expect to find there.
[01:56:44.626 --> 01:56:45.827]  It's just that this is just...
[01:56:47.017 --> 01:56:47.857]  One more idiocy.
[01:56:47.877 --> 01:56:59.061]  See, since they have the biochemical attack in Chicago, it's time to do something about the anthrax thing, just like Saudi Arabia right on the heels of Dirty Bomb in Seattle.
[01:56:59.081 --> 01:57:00.381]  Yeah, they're terrorizing us.
[01:57:00.941 --> 01:57:14.925]  The government's been caught, it's been in the mainstream news, ordering FBI and CIA to quote put out fake terror alerts to quote create hysteria, yelling fire in a crowded theater over and over again and saying, we're your saviors.
[01:57:16.035 --> 01:57:24.801]  Hey, what do you think about the NRA having to admit that they want to expand the assault weapons ban to almost everything and actually ban the guns and that Bush is going to sign it?
[01:57:25.362 --> 01:57:34.168]  Well, the NRA, any citizen who thinks that the NRA is going to uphold and defend their personal liberties is mistaken.
[01:57:35.029 --> 01:57:43.995]  To me, when you delegate your authority to a group to uphold your personal liberties, then you don't want your personal liberties because you've just given them up to some group
[01:57:44.454 --> 01:57:53.357]  You're either lazy, and you don't want to defend your rights, or... So to think that the NRA is going to do something is a fallacy.
[01:57:54.857 --> 01:57:55.918]  Anything else, Wyatt?
[01:57:56.038 --> 01:57:56.738]  That's it, Alex.
[01:57:56.798 --> 01:57:58.178]  Great job.
[01:57:58.438 --> 01:57:59.058]  I love you, man.
[01:57:59.119 --> 01:57:59.759]  I'm glad you're on.
[01:58:00.239 --> 01:58:02.079]  Are you enjoying listening to us in D.C.?
[01:58:02.420 --> 01:58:03.000]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:03.020 --> 01:58:03.360]  10.50 a.m.
[01:58:03.420 --> 01:58:04.980]  WPOC in Washington, D.C.
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:05.280]  All right.
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:05.921]  Take care, buddy.
[01:58:05.941 --> 01:58:06.021]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:06.061 --> 01:58:07.481]  Bunch of news coming up.
[01:58:07.501 --> 01:58:08.281]  Stay with us.
[01:58:15.314 --> 01:58:19.198]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:58:19.438 --> 01:58:24.883]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:58:25.163 --> 01:58:35.513]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:58:35.693 --> 01:58:40.017]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:58:40.097 --> 01:58:41.018]  We're good to go!
[01:58:57.637 --> 01:58:58.138]  We're good to go.
[01:59:15.763 --> 01:59:23.132]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:23.413 --> 01:59:28.159]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:28.379 --> 01:59:34.026]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:34.246 --> 01:59:34.986]  We're good to go.
[01:59:50.875 --> 01:59:53.398]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:59:53.618 --> 02:00:00.364]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:00:14.528 --> 02:00:18.912]  This is Joyce Riley, and most of you know I've searched for over five years to find something to help the vets.
[02:00:19.272 --> 02:00:21.153]  Well, I found something that will help everybody.
[02:00:21.554 --> 02:00:27.338]  Miracle-2's soap, neutralizer, gel, and skin moisturizer have prompted testimonies from people all over the country.

[02:00:42.457 --> 02:00:47.099]  Well, many people who have used Miracle-2 products have stated that they have literally washed their problems away.
[02:00:47.779 --> 02:00:50.159]  The folks from Miracle-2 don't have to make these claims.

[02:01:15.398 --> 02:01:17.620]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:20.963]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:35.807 --> 02:01:38.669]  Alright folks, toll free number to join us on air.
[02:01:39.650 --> 02:01:42.672]  I do this show Monday through Friday, but the toll free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:01:47.905 --> 02:01:51.448]  And I do this show Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:01:51.628 --> 02:01:52.528]  until 2 p.m.
[02:01:53.029 --> 02:01:54.750]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:59.573]  Central Standard Time, and then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:01:59.613 --> 02:02:05.857]  So 11 to 2 Central, 12 to 3 Eastern, and 9 to midnight Central, that's 10 to 1 a.m.
[02:02:06.338 --> 02:02:07.258]  Eastern at night.
[02:02:08.039 --> 02:02:13.302]  With a broadcast Central, a rebroadcast Central Standard Time from 1 a.m.
[02:02:15.161 --> 02:02:15.901]  1 a.m.
[02:02:15.961 --> 02:02:19.562]  I can't seem to say that until 4 a.m.
[02:02:19.982 --> 02:02:21.162]  of the daytime show.
[02:02:21.182 --> 02:02:27.004]  I'm going to get back into this gun-grabbing news and into this Toronto Star story about 9-1-1.
[02:02:27.564 --> 02:02:31.084]  And then Senator Graham saying there's a whitewash cover-up going on.
[02:02:31.605 --> 02:02:35.245]  And it's a whitewash cover-up within a whitewash cover-up with this guy.
[02:02:35.985 --> 02:02:36.726]  That's coming up.
[02:02:36.786 --> 02:02:38.206]  But right now let's go to Cal.
[02:02:39.006 --> 02:02:40.627]  And Cal, where are you calling us from?
[02:02:41.668 --> 02:02:42.048]  Chicago.
[02:02:42.348 --> 02:02:43.289]  Good to talk to you.
[02:02:43.349 --> 02:02:45.170]  Oh yeah, that's a good idea.
[02:02:45.230 --> 02:02:48.432]  We need folks to call in about the drills that are going on.
[02:02:48.472 --> 02:02:50.613]  What's happening right now in the martial law drill?
[02:02:51.094 --> 02:02:54.096]  Well, I haven't heard anything on it really myself, but I was interested to see.
[02:02:54.136 --> 02:02:58.938]  I've got a few items I noticed in the paper today called quick takes sometimes.
[02:02:59.879 --> 02:03:02.241]  And one of them says that it's a new item.
[02:03:02.261 --> 02:03:07.664]  The House Budget Subcommittee plans to cut $25 billion in veterans' benefits over the next 10 years.
[02:03:09.429 --> 02:03:12.451]  For those that didn't hear, cut $25 billion in veterans benefits.
[02:03:12.471 --> 02:03:13.912]  That's only the tip of the iceberg.
[02:03:13.952 --> 02:03:20.296]  They announced veterans over 65 will get nothing if Bush gets his new budget.
[02:03:20.676 --> 02:03:21.076]  Nothing!
[02:03:21.136 --> 02:03:21.957]  And they earned it.
[02:03:22.297 --> 02:03:23.838]  It's theirs, it's not welfare.
[02:03:24.318 --> 02:03:29.121]  I don't want to hear it's welfare from the neocons, who give all the corporate welfare all day.
[02:03:29.901 --> 02:03:32.723]  And under this new system, sir, you'll get nothing.
[02:03:33.863 --> 02:03:34.764]  Well, that begets me.
[02:03:34.784 --> 02:03:36.865]  See, I had 38 years in the Air Force.
[02:03:37.959 --> 02:03:47.306]  And I read this, and then they also got it where the Department of Veterans Affairs is ordered to stop publicizing health benefits available to veterans.
[02:03:48.887 --> 02:03:50.048]  That I don't go for either.
[02:03:50.068 --> 02:03:54.791]  Yeah, I have friends that are veterans and we have some of the nicer veterans hospitals in Central Texas.
[02:03:55.332 --> 02:03:57.573]  They try to get benefits, they're given nothing.
[02:03:57.633 --> 02:04:00.115]  They need blood pressure medicine, they gotta pay for it.
[02:04:01.336 --> 02:04:02.857]  It is disgusting.
[02:04:02.897 --> 02:04:06.520]  And they said in a federal court ruling, okay, we told veterans
[02:04:07.268 --> 02:04:12.612]  That they would get lifetime benefits if they served 23 years, but we lied.
[02:04:12.672 --> 02:04:16.995]  They actually said, you don't have a contract with us, you're getting nothing.
[02:04:17.835 --> 02:04:29.203]  Well, that's what I remember when I went in, they told me, well, you get all these benefits if you stay in for a long time, get 20 or 30 years in, you got your family, you'll become a medical, and now they're trying to give a ticket to us, you know.
[02:04:30.006 --> 02:04:43.930]  The federal court ruled on the Justice Department and Defense Department side, both sides were arguing, both those groups were arguing for the government, that above 65 you get nothing.
[02:04:44.370 --> 02:04:49.171]  And I actually got calls, this was all over the news, people denying this.
[02:04:49.451 --> 02:04:51.772]  How dare you say that about President Bush?
[02:04:52.072 --> 02:04:53.472]  He wouldn't do something like that.
[02:04:53.812 --> 02:04:55.113]  President Bush didn't do anything.
[02:04:55.153 --> 02:04:56.333]  The guy's not running anything.
[02:04:57.482 --> 02:05:10.791]  Whether it's Republicans or Democrats, open borders, more control, more gun control, supercomputers to China, blocking Dan Burton's committee on Barton Gate, right down the list selling us out.
[02:05:11.872 --> 02:05:12.693]  That's what they're doing.
[02:05:13.974 --> 02:05:17.676]  That's exactly what they're doing, my friend, and we appreciate your service to this country.
[02:05:17.696 --> 02:05:24.581]  We're sorry to hear that happening to you, and you earned those benefits, and this is disgusting.
[02:05:26.115 --> 02:05:39.781]  They even, in the trial, brought out the brochures that told people, people say brochures from 30, 40, 20 years ago, saying you would get benefits for life and so would your family!
[02:05:41.581 --> 02:05:53.806]  And the government said, we don't care, you didn't get a contract with us, we fooled you, it's in the government's interest, actually said, in the government's interest not to pay you benefits.
[02:05:54.067 --> 02:05:55.107]  Does that make you angry?
[02:05:58.339 --> 02:05:59.880]  Nothing to do about it.
[02:05:59.900 --> 02:06:00.800]  They got you, you know.
[02:06:02.581 --> 02:06:04.321]  If they get your guns, they're really going to get you.
[02:06:04.381 --> 02:06:05.582]  Oh yeah, that's for sure.
[02:06:06.302 --> 02:06:07.403]  But if they have a problem.
[02:06:09.163 --> 02:06:11.164]  Well, I'm sorry that they've done this to you.
[02:06:11.444 --> 02:06:15.206]  Don't worry, they'll socialize health care in the name of getting you health care, and then you'll get nothing.
[02:06:15.226 --> 02:06:17.267]  Yeah, I believe that too.
[02:06:17.767 --> 02:06:19.167]  What an incredible scam, isn't it?
[02:06:19.407 --> 02:06:20.608]  Oh yeah, that's for sure.
[02:06:21.481 --> 02:06:24.243]  How are the new troops getting?
[02:06:24.483 --> 02:06:28.926]  Were they promising them to... Oh, they're promising them everything, and of course they'll get nothing else.
[02:06:29.106 --> 02:06:30.067]  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt that.
[02:06:30.427 --> 02:06:34.850]  Well, you know, the troops don't read the newspaper or don't have any... They're like the general public.
[02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:35.550]  They're good people.
[02:06:35.570 --> 02:06:36.631]  They're just totally ignorant.
[02:06:37.151 --> 02:06:39.493]  And so they're hearing all the lies and getting signed up.
[02:06:40.854 --> 02:06:44.156]  And if they get hit with nerve gas again, like in the first Gulf War, they won't be treated.
[02:06:44.696 --> 02:06:45.317]  If the D.E.U.
[02:06:45.357 --> 02:06:46.437]  hurts them, they won't be treated.
[02:06:46.457 --> 02:06:49.099]  Well, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:06:49.639 --> 02:06:50.060]  Thank you.
[02:06:51.287 --> 02:07:13.443]  Yeah, today supporting the troops means flying a flag made by slaves in China, having big plastic stickers made in China stuck on both doors of your minivan, a mindless soccer mom with dim beady eyes driving along worshipping Bush or Clinton or whoever.
[02:07:14.063 --> 02:07:16.185]  That's the inheritor of the earth.
[02:07:17.057 --> 02:07:24.519]  That's the new patriotism and scoffing at veterans as they died by the tens of thousands not being given treatment when they were nerve gassed.
[02:07:25.679 --> 02:07:26.499]  Not by Saddam!
[02:07:26.559 --> 02:07:30.520]  Oh no, our government's ordered them to blow up the evidence of the weapons our government had sold them.
[02:07:30.780 --> 02:07:32.800]  They huffed those gases and weren't given treatment.
[02:07:34.841 --> 02:07:35.621]  Let me slow down.
[02:07:35.661 --> 02:07:37.801]  I'm already kind of gyrating out of control.
[02:07:37.821 --> 02:07:39.302]  It's like I've got marbles in my mouth.
[02:07:39.362 --> 02:07:40.502]  I do this sometimes.
[02:07:42.382 --> 02:07:43.263]  It's all out of control.
[02:07:43.303 --> 02:07:44.623]  Let me read this again.
[02:07:45.566 --> 02:07:55.633]  The Second Amendment news is so important, I'm going to cover it again, then I'm going to get in a Conspiracy Crusader, doubts official, 911 version out of the Toronto Star.
[02:07:57.255 --> 02:08:07.422]  And then I'll get into more in the tragic, right on time, convenient, legitimizing the police state bombings that took place in Saudi Arabia overnight.
[02:08:09.833 --> 02:08:24.095]  But for years we've called for the NRA to admit that Bush planned to reauthorize the Clinton gun grab bill, and now we learn they plan on expanding it, the Democrats are hailing Bush, and he's sending signals he'll sign it no matter what's attached to it.
[02:08:24.476 --> 02:08:34.677]  So they're going to expand it, and don't worry, there will be some convenient mass shootings, unfortunately, right before the passage of it to legitimize.
[02:08:34.757 --> 02:08:38.278]  Even Limbaugh has pointed that out, that why are there always shootings right before
[02:08:39.293 --> 02:08:40.594]  They do some big gun bill.
[02:08:40.634 --> 02:08:41.534]  It's very convenient.
[02:08:42.215 --> 02:08:44.275]  Most sweeping gun ban ever hits Congress.
[02:08:44.356 --> 02:08:47.917]  Clinton ban reenactment targets millions more guns.
[02:08:48.297 --> 02:08:53.440]  NRA finally reported on their little-known legislative website, nothing in their magazine.
[02:08:54.100 --> 02:08:55.401]  If you find something, let me know.
[02:08:57.061 --> 02:09:06.726]  They say, as we predicted, you mean as you covered up, the anti-gunners have begun to push to further expand the Clinton gun ban of 94, which will now be known as the Bush gun ban.
[02:09:08.015 --> 02:09:18.763]  Not content with merely reauthorizing the ban, Representative John Conyers, Democrat Michigan, Carolyn McCarthy, Democrat New York, have drafted legislation that bans millions more guns.
[02:09:19.363 --> 02:09:21.065]  It's a giant step closer to the goals
[02:09:21.710 --> 02:09:40.007]  Started and stated by Clinton gun sponsor Senator Dianne Feinstein, who said on CBS 60 Minutes, quote, If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them in, I would have done it.
[02:09:40.748 --> 02:09:44.151]  Toward that goal, Conyers McCarthy would
[02:09:45.029 --> 02:09:48.213]  Ban every gun made to lawfully comply with the Clinton ban.
[02:09:48.233 --> 02:09:54.200]  The Clinton ban arbitrarily dictates the kinds of grips, stocks, and attachments that new guns could have.
[02:09:54.641 --> 02:10:01.830]  Massachusetts implied new guns were made to conform to the Clinton gun restrictions.
[02:10:02.954 --> 02:10:04.334]  And it's in Massachusetts.
[02:10:04.395 --> 02:10:05.955]  Manufacturers complied.
[02:10:06.475 --> 02:10:10.296]  New guns were made to conform to the Clinton restrictions.
[02:10:10.756 --> 02:10:13.757]  Now prohibitionists want to ban the new guns, too.
[02:10:14.517 --> 02:10:15.398]  Ban guns!
[02:10:15.478 --> 02:10:18.959]  The Clinton legislation, especially exempted from prohibition.
[02:10:19.299 --> 02:10:22.680]  That includes many Ruger 14s, ranch rifles,
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:33.108]  And 30 caliber carbines and entire classes of guns including fixed magazine rifles and as well as shotguns that hold under five rounds.
[02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:37.092]  No one after any semi-automatic shotgun that holds more than three rounds.
[02:10:38.081 --> 02:10:40.262]  Ban guns widely used for target shooting.
[02:10:40.702 --> 02:10:45.704]  It bans three centerfire rifles most commonly used for marksmanship competition.
[02:10:46.024 --> 02:10:52.446]  The Colt AR-15, the Springfield M1A1, M1A, and the M1 Grand.
[02:10:52.867 --> 02:10:55.208]  Ban all semi-automatic shotguns.
[02:10:55.968 --> 02:10:56.188]  Ooh.
[02:10:56.940 --> 02:10:57.841]  I thought it was three-round.
[02:10:57.861 --> 02:10:59.963]  I guess another part says... What about self-defense?
[02:11:13.056 --> 02:11:14.337]  Ban guns for defense.
[02:11:14.417 --> 02:11:16.459]  Ban any semi-automatic rifle or shotgun.
[02:11:16.839 --> 02:11:17.419]  Any U.S.
[02:11:17.460 --> 02:11:32.451]  Attorney General one day claims is not sporting, even though self-defense is a fundamental right in the federal constitution that constitutes, in the constitution of 44 states and the laws of all 50 states recognize the right to use guns for defense.
[02:11:33.832 --> 02:11:34.572]  Ban 68 named guns.
[02:11:37.944 --> 02:11:39.385]  Ban 68 named guns.
[02:11:39.465 --> 02:11:41.185]  Clinton ban named 19 guns.
[02:11:41.265 --> 02:11:45.287]  Ban parts used to repair and refurbish guns, including frames and receivers.
[02:11:45.747 --> 02:11:49.948]  Ban importation and ammunition of magazines, exempt under Clinton ban.
[02:11:50.388 --> 02:11:55.150]  Ban private sales of millions of guns, their frames and receivers and their parts.
[02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:59.131]  Ban semi-automatic rifles under 30 inches long, useful for home defense.
[02:11:59.551 --> 02:12:02.692]  Ban all semi-automatic rifles that can hold more than 10 rounds.
[02:12:03.052 --> 02:12:04.993]  Ban guns rarely used in crime.
[02:12:05.293 --> 02:12:07.394]  State and local law enforcement agencies reports
[02:12:08.337 --> 02:12:17.620]  ...have always shown that guns on the Clinton-Conyers-McCarthy ban list have NEVER been used in more than a small percentage of violent crime.
[02:12:18.060 --> 02:12:28.404]  The constitutionally mandated study of the Clinton law concluded that guns that are banned were never used in more than a fraction of all gun murders.
[02:12:29.124 --> 02:12:34.726]  But even if they were, are the rights and liberties of law-abiding citizens to be dictated by the acts of criminals?
[02:12:35.905 --> 02:12:47.808]  Again, backdoor registration requires manufacturers to ban guns, frames, receivers, and parts to report the names of their dealers and requires dealers to report any of those parts they have in stock.
[02:12:47.949 --> 02:12:52.230]  Next step is obviously demanding the names of gun owners who buy those parts.
[02:12:53.110 --> 02:13:03.173]  And Bush says he will sign this bill with all the added garbage.
[02:13:05.083 --> 02:13:11.346]  And they've got S-22 that reddishes all gun odors, shuts down gun shows, and creates a national ballistics database.
[02:13:12.366 --> 02:13:13.387]  Total gun grabbing.
[02:13:17.028 --> 02:13:20.650]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[02:13:20.810 --> 02:13:25.212]  Air purifier is not a filter, and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[02:13:25.392 --> 02:13:29.834]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[02:13:29.874 --> 02:13:32.955]  There are no moving parts, and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[02:13:33.275 --> 02:13:37.900]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.

[02:13:42.345 --> 02:13:44.727]  And the aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.

[02:13:54.517 --> 02:13:57.458]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[02:13:57.598 --> 02:13:59.478]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.

[02:14:02.599 --> 02:14:04.360]  And tell them you heard about it on Genesis.

[02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:06.320]  That's 877-605-9200.
[02:14:14.534 --> 02:14:20.739]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:14:21.199 --> 02:14:28.985]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:14:29.326 --> 02:14:37.172]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:14:37.492 --> 02:14:42.254]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:14:42.574 --> 02:14:47.275]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:14:47.795 --> 02:14:51.657]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:14:52.157 --> 02:14:53.157]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:17:03.442 --> 02:17:03.823]  That's right.
[02:17:26.252 --> 02:17:27.853]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:27.993 --> 02:17:29.915]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:17:29.935 --> 02:17:45.986]  We're about to go to Don, Hal, Sue, Bill and others that are patiently holding and I am going to take about 10 minutes out sometime in the next segment to read this conspiracy crusader doubts official 9-1-1 version and have a few comments about the tragic bombing that will try to legitimize the police state in Saudi Arabia.
[02:17:46.912 --> 02:17:49.133]  But I wanted to hit on this briefly before I go to the calls.
[02:17:49.273 --> 02:17:53.214]  Lawsuit seeks to ban sale of Oreos to children in California.
[02:17:53.254 --> 02:17:55.835]  Nabisco taken to task over trans fatty effects.
[02:17:56.415 --> 02:17:57.756]  Now this came out a few days ago.
[02:17:57.776 --> 02:18:13.801]  And I told you that the Agriculture Department says they want to have a special tax when you eat beef, when you eat fried chicken, when you eat sugar, when you drink a Coca-Cola, anything that is bad for you or they can say is bad for you,
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:15.341]  They're going to tax you.
[02:18:15.401 --> 02:18:16.241]  Now, how are they going to do that?
[02:18:16.301 --> 02:18:21.665]  They say, with a national ID card, your multi-pass is what it'll be called for everyone's security and safety.
[02:18:21.985 --> 02:18:23.126]  Your life will be controlled.
[02:18:23.146 --> 02:18:25.128]  That data will be given to insurance companies.
[02:18:25.548 --> 02:18:28.890]  You'll have to swipe it and go through all the rigmarole.
[02:18:29.491 --> 02:18:30.472]  This is total control.
[02:18:30.512 --> 02:18:33.234]  The thumb scanners are going in the grocery stores from Texas to New York.
[02:18:33.574 --> 02:18:35.095]  We're only a few years away from this.
[02:18:35.315 --> 02:18:36.836]  Federal policy reports.
[02:18:37.277 --> 02:18:38.217]  Not my opinion.
[02:18:38.257 --> 02:18:39.118]  Not a conspiracy.
[02:18:40.518 --> 02:18:44.901]  Now, they're suing the gun manufacturers, and they're shutting down a lot of them, even though they're losing most of the suits.
[02:18:45.981 --> 02:18:47.923]  Gun prices have gone up by at least a third.
[02:18:49.063 --> 02:18:52.085]  They said they're going to destroy the guns by doing this, the gun makers.
[02:18:53.366 --> 02:18:55.227]  And hence, the Second Amendment.
[02:18:56.848 --> 02:19:01.191]  But, you see, it's going to expand out into the fast foods, into cars, into everything.
[02:19:01.895 --> 02:19:14.847]  Oreo cookies should be banned from sale to children in California according to a lawsuit filed by a San Francisco attorney who claims that trans fat, the stuff that makes the cookie crisp and they're filling creamy, is so dangerous children shouldn't eat it.
[02:19:14.867 --> 02:19:18.450]  And of course it's ban the guns for the children, ban the cookies for the children.
[02:19:18.910 --> 02:19:28.239]  Steven Joseph, who filed the suit against Nabisco last week in Martin County Superior Court, is a public interest lawyer who last battled the city to remove graffiti from traffic signs.
[02:19:29.884 --> 02:19:41.571]  And, uh, he took up the trans fat battle after reading about the dangerous effects of artificial fat in several stories published by the Chronicle that showed how trans fat is hidden in many of the popular snack foods Americans eat.
[02:19:41.931 --> 02:19:42.951]  And it is bad for ya!
[02:19:43.212 --> 02:19:43.852]  But so what?
[02:19:43.912 --> 02:19:46.493]  Everybody knows it, and there shouldn't be any controls on it.
[02:19:46.834 --> 02:19:48.535]  They should pull it out of the schools.
[02:19:48.595 --> 02:19:50.336]  They got the junk food machines everywhere.
[02:19:50.676 --> 02:19:56.339]  Your kid bounces off the wall after three Cokes and two packs of Oreos, and they say put them on Ritalin, and that's how they do it.
[02:19:57.498 --> 02:19:59.899]  So that should be taken out of the schools, but sue them?
[02:20:00.380 --> 02:20:00.720]  No.
[02:20:01.460 --> 02:20:02.160]  It's insane.
[02:20:02.561 --> 02:20:03.881]  But that's where it's all going.
[02:20:04.722 --> 02:20:05.582]  Bringing you tyranny.
[02:20:06.203 --> 02:20:08.764]  Don in Oklahoma, good to talk to you, sir.
[02:20:10.805 --> 02:20:12.206]  I heard that radio got cut down quick.
[02:20:12.246 --> 02:20:12.646]  Good job.
[02:20:12.686 --> 02:20:13.706]  What's on your mind, Don?
[02:20:15.187 --> 02:20:16.928]  Alex... Put him back on hold.
[02:20:17.688 --> 02:20:18.969]  I'm going to beg the listeners.
[02:20:19.549 --> 02:20:24.452]  Do not ever come on with your radio cranked up.
[02:20:24.592 --> 02:20:25.272]  Please.
[02:20:25.392 --> 02:20:25.753]  Go ahead.
[02:20:25.773 --> 02:20:26.253]  You're on the air.
[02:20:26.872 --> 02:20:27.412]  I'm sorry.
[02:20:28.453 --> 02:20:28.853]  That's okay.
[02:20:28.893 --> 02:20:29.574]  I'm not mad at you.
[02:20:29.594 --> 02:20:31.035]  I'm just mad at the radio being on.
[02:20:31.075 --> 02:20:31.495]  Go ahead.
[02:20:33.216 --> 02:20:34.857]  Alex Jones is my hero.
[02:20:35.978 --> 02:20:42.142]  And I'm embarrassed because I didn't know anything about you until about six months ago.
[02:20:42.563 --> 02:20:44.104]  But I know everything about you now.
[02:20:45.225 --> 02:20:51.669]  And here in Oklahoma, I wish, well I've been copying your Save Bill of Rights campaign.
[02:20:53.415 --> 02:20:57.479]  I've been copying the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them.
[02:20:58.496 --> 02:21:04.200]  By the way, over 300 cities have passed the law reaffirming the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:11.825]  It's passed, or it's into the House and passed the committees in Alaska, several other states, Hawaii's passed one.
[02:21:12.425 --> 02:21:23.572]  It's happening and conservative cities are passing my resolution, or variants of it, reaffirming the Bill of Rights, denouncing the dictatorship that is FEMA, NORTHCOM, military takeover.
[02:21:23.592 --> 02:21:24.453]  Right.
[02:21:25.097 --> 02:21:30.985]  I wish Oklahoma would get their head out of their butts and the ones that's running would stick up for themselves.
[02:21:31.686 --> 02:21:35.811]  Sir, I'm not mad at you again, but the radio was up and now you're using mild stuff.
[02:21:36.012 --> 02:21:37.233]  We have a lot of children listening.
[02:21:37.534 --> 02:21:39.797]  Let's talk like we're addressing a large crowd of children.
[02:21:40.547 --> 02:21:40.927]  Okay.
[02:21:41.368 --> 02:21:48.172]  Don, I understand your frustration, though, and I want to commend you for taking action, but even your local papers are having to admit the Patriot Act is tyrannical.
[02:21:48.673 --> 02:21:59.800]  Get good conservatives to read Patriot Act 1 and 2, or the analysis that are out there, analyses, and I guarantee you, you can get a repudiation of the Patriot Act passed in your state or in your cities.
[02:22:00.861 --> 02:22:03.203]  Okay, that's what I'm kind of scared of.
[02:22:03.303 --> 02:22:06.325]  I don't know who to go to, who to give it to.
[02:22:06.685 --> 02:22:08.046]  How many copies have you given out?
[02:22:08.971 --> 02:22:10.371]  I haven't given any out yet.
[02:22:11.212 --> 02:22:16.873]  I've got probably 700 copies printed up.
[02:22:18.533 --> 02:22:23.314]  I would go to the legislature and I would walk from room to room handing it to them.
[02:22:23.354 --> 02:22:26.415]  We've done that with my videos for free here in Texas.
[02:22:26.455 --> 02:22:27.895]  We've mailed some to Congress as well.
[02:22:28.775 --> 02:22:31.096]  I would get with you and a couple neighbors.
[02:22:31.176 --> 02:22:32.256]  I would go pass them out.
[02:22:32.816 --> 02:22:36.717]  I would go to the bigger churches and put them on the car windshields.
[02:22:37.552 --> 02:22:40.613]  Uh, I would, uh, email copies to local talk show host.
[02:22:42.614 --> 02:22:46.216]  Uh, that's without going to one of the... Pardon me?
[02:22:46.716 --> 02:22:52.219]  Without going to the so-called government, uh, isolation camp.
[02:22:53.499 --> 02:22:55.580]  Unfortunately, your cell phone's cutting out.
[02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:57.801]  Thank you, Don, for getting in the fight.
[02:22:57.861 --> 02:22:59.182]  Just get it out to somebody.
[02:22:59.542 --> 02:23:00.622]  That's what'll have an effect.
[02:23:00.642 --> 02:23:01.703]  And make copies of my videos.
[02:23:01.723 --> 02:23:04.584]  We'll come back and talk to Hal Sue and Bill and others and cover news.
[02:23:05.524 --> 02:23:08.505]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.426 --> 02:23:12.207]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.769 --> 02:23:17.390]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:23:17.750 --> 02:23:23.472]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:23:23.732 --> 02:23:26.894]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water for the cleanest... That's 877-605-9200.
[02:23:26.914 --> 02:23:27.254]  Call today.
[02:23:41.607 --> 02:23:48.249]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:23:48.269 --> 02:23:50.889]  Let's go to these calls quick so I can get to the rest of this key news.
[02:23:51.509 --> 02:23:53.429]  Hal in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:23:53.469 --> 02:23:54.030]  Welcome, sir.
[02:23:54.810 --> 02:23:56.630]  Thanks for taking the call, Alex.
[02:23:57.710 --> 02:24:03.971]  I'm not great at articulating as you are on most of this stuff.
[02:24:04.031 --> 02:24:05.212]  I understand it very well.
[02:24:07.907 --> 02:24:23.452]  I want to talk about the NRA and about the Brady Bill, so-called assault rifle bans and expansion of that bill and furthering that bill and all that, if I could.
[02:24:24.152 --> 02:24:24.512]  Sure!
[02:24:25.352 --> 02:24:31.614]  Okay, I'm a 40-plus year member and a life and endowment member of the NRA.
[02:24:32.494 --> 02:24:37.556]  And I think one of the problems the NRA has is they don't listen to their membership.
[02:24:38.413 --> 02:24:45.119]  The whole time that I've been a member, I've been able to talk to our state representative maybe one time.
[02:24:45.199 --> 02:24:54.728]  I've called a number of times and I generally, quite frankly, get sandbagged and promised callbacks which I don't get and things like that.
[02:24:55.649 --> 02:25:03.116]  But NRA supported George Bush, as you well know, both of them.
[02:25:04.918 --> 02:25:12.000]  That was either a very bad mistake or it was by design and I'm not too sure which.
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:25.123]  I think, quite frankly, NRA is like the difference between our de facto government and our constitutional government.
[02:25:25.463 --> 02:25:30.204]  I believe that the same difference between NRA and NRA membership gun rights.
[02:25:31.924 --> 02:25:33.745]  The name of the game is control.
[02:25:34.761 --> 02:25:37.022]  Goes for both.
[02:25:37.042 --> 02:25:52.688]  And NRA, while supposedly supporting the membership and the gun rights, they train the police, including some of these SWAT teams that run around in the Nazi helmets and black ski masks you're talking about.
[02:25:54.049 --> 02:25:59.851]  And I believe that if things go, and this is my opinion of course,
[02:26:00.968 --> 02:26:07.851]  But the opinion I might tell the NRA of an NRA member, which they won't listen to, won't even hear.
[02:26:08.311 --> 02:26:13.234]  And that's not me personally, but I think most members.
[02:26:14.194 --> 02:26:17.215]  And they won't listen to the membership.
[02:26:17.395 --> 02:26:23.078]  And I believe that their main game is control over the membership.
[02:26:23.138 --> 02:26:29.481]  And that in the long haul, they'll be controlling all gun sports, all activities in guns.
[02:26:30.282 --> 02:26:30.902]  No, that's it.
[02:26:31.022 --> 02:26:33.823]  They tried to get the $47 billion dollar land grab.
[02:26:34.264 --> 02:26:55.312]  They want to partner with the government, NRA, in fact it actually said this in a bill, you're right on target, you probably knew about this, where you're going to have to go to an NRA range where your guns are kept, check them out, everyone will have to be NRA approved, and they're going to be, as you notice in the media, it's never the government versus the Second Amendment, it's always the government versus the NRA.
[02:26:55.712 --> 02:26:57.293]  It's all about the NRA
[02:26:58.013 --> 02:27:03.437]  And then whenever we try to defeat gun bills in Texas, they're quote neutral on incredibly bad bills.
[02:27:03.777 --> 02:27:06.839]  We go out and defeat them and then they attack us in the newspaper.
[02:27:07.719 --> 02:27:10.561]  I mean, we have congressmen and senators have come to our rallies.
[02:27:11.002 --> 02:27:13.443]  NRA won't send even the representative from Austin.
[02:27:13.924 --> 02:27:21.649]  They're totally elitist and they're about keeping control of the millions of active gun rights people thinking, look, it's a Trojan horse.
[02:27:22.009 --> 02:27:25.631]  They can't control 130 million people without having Trojan horses.
[02:27:25.691 --> 02:27:26.612]  It's like the Union
[02:27:27.466 --> 02:27:34.358]  The unions have agreed to give up their people's benefits or the unions have agreed to go along because the union fat cats are getting paid off!
[02:27:34.759 --> 02:27:35.500]  It's that simple!
[02:27:36.494 --> 02:27:38.917]  Alex, I haven't got a single notice on that or any of the
[02:27:58.157 --> 02:28:04.262]  This business of the reinstatement of the Brady Bill and... Yeah, why isn't it covered?
[02:28:04.602 --> 02:28:08.806]  Why isn't it the cover every month in their magazine that goes out to 5-plus mil?
[02:28:09.707 --> 02:28:12.609]  And then the pass-around readership of that's 15 million people.
[02:28:13.069 --> 02:28:17.033]  Why aren't there posters in the gun shops saying, take back the Second Amendment?
[02:28:17.313 --> 02:28:17.653]  Well, no.
[02:28:17.953 --> 02:28:21.576]  They've got this attitude, we're gonna lose it, let's try to hang on as long as we can.
[02:28:21.877 --> 02:28:24.559]  They're gonna ban all semi-automatic shotguns.
[02:28:24.579 --> 02:28:25.199]  Did you hear this?
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:26.981]  And Bush will sign this.
[02:28:28.061 --> 02:28:35.423]  Yes, and I think that first off, we're going to have to get away from both parties.
[02:28:35.443 --> 02:28:39.965]  The NRA got George Bush Jr.
[02:28:40.025 --> 02:28:41.465]  elected this last time.
[02:28:42.025 --> 02:28:44.486]  We're going to have to go for another party now.
[02:28:44.506 --> 02:28:47.587]  I know that sounds crazy to some people, but... No, no.
[02:28:47.707 --> 02:28:53.569]  It'd be better to get Perry or Al Gorin there, because at least we know who we're dealing with.
[02:28:55.265 --> 02:29:02.591]  Well, the membership is going to have to take some control in the NRA and be heard.
[02:29:02.791 --> 02:29:04.112]  How does that board work?
[02:29:04.153 --> 02:29:07.035]  How do you fire the whole board and put new people in?
[02:29:07.916 --> 02:29:17.123]  Well, it just about can't be done, Alex, because if you want to be a board member, you've got to be voted for.
[02:29:17.223 --> 02:29:21.307]  And the only way you can do that is you can submit your own name.
[02:29:22.637 --> 02:29:25.378]  But the truth is... But who votes on it?
[02:29:25.898 --> 02:29:38.522]  The structure is such that it's almost impossible without the approval of the directors to be nominated to the board and then get elected.
[02:29:38.542 --> 02:29:41.823]  You know, I've read about the structure years ago, but refresh my memory.
[02:29:42.183 --> 02:29:43.644]  How was it voted upon?
[02:29:44.464 --> 02:29:49.766]  Well, life members and voting members vote
[02:29:51.275 --> 02:29:52.676]  Uh, on the board members.
[02:29:53.056 --> 02:30:01.221]  But it's like Mosul, with the election they just had in Northern Iraq, where our government appoints 250 people to vote for who they want.
[02:30:01.281 --> 02:30:01.702]  Is that it?
[02:30:01.762 --> 02:30:06.184]  They decide who gets nominated and they give you a choice of their selection?
[02:30:06.564 --> 02:30:08.666]  It's about like the two political parties.
[02:30:08.806 --> 02:30:11.768]  Once they select the people for you to vote, you get to vote.
[02:30:11.788 --> 02:30:14.169]  Uh, if you understand that.
[02:30:14.389 --> 02:30:18.311]  Once they select the people that you're to vote for, then you get to vote on them.
[02:30:19.693 --> 02:30:22.174]  You're not voting anybody in other than who they want in.
[02:30:22.194 --> 02:30:24.914]  Do you follow what I'm saying?
[02:30:24.934 --> 02:30:25.215]  I know.
[02:30:26.095 --> 02:30:26.395]  I know.
[02:30:26.435 --> 02:30:30.516]  Did you know that Heston actually campaigned for the 1968 Gun Control Act?
[02:30:30.776 --> 02:30:31.536]  Yes, I do.
[02:30:31.616 --> 02:30:32.137]  I know that.
[02:30:32.977 --> 02:30:34.677]  I've got a really bad videotape of him.
[02:30:34.717 --> 02:30:36.438]  If somebody has a better one, please send it to me.
[02:30:36.498 --> 02:30:39.539]  I'm begging for it, but... Well, Heston's out now, of course.
[02:30:39.799 --> 02:30:41.499]  Yeah, well, he was always a titular head.
[02:30:41.519 --> 02:30:42.339]  We've had him on the show.
[02:30:42.379 --> 02:30:45.340]  I don't think he's bad, but, you know, he didn't know what he was doing.
[02:30:46.040 --> 02:30:47.761]  Hey, I appreciate you joining me, sir.
[02:30:49.312 --> 02:30:52.033]  Yeah, I mean, it's just Gun Grabber Bush is the new name.
[02:30:52.773 --> 02:30:55.034]  Sue in California, go ahead Sue, you're on the air.
[02:30:55.054 --> 02:30:58.195]  Hi, thanks for your work to the community and our country.
[02:30:58.215 --> 02:30:59.476]  Hey, you guys don't have to thank me.
[02:30:59.496 --> 02:31:01.897]  Thank you to all of you out there taking action.
[02:31:02.317 --> 02:31:03.978]  Yeah, well you're inspiring me, I'll just say that.
[02:31:04.438 --> 02:31:13.801]  I was wondering, I'm trying to, because I believe in my right to the Second Amendment, and I was wondering, I'm applying for a gun now, and I was wondering how this issue is going to affect me.
[02:31:13.821 --> 02:31:15.722]  What do you mean applying for a gun?
[02:31:15.862 --> 02:31:18.663]  Well, I'm here in California and they make me register it.
[02:31:19.079 --> 02:31:22.661]  I have to go through like a 10-day wait period.
[02:31:23.042 --> 02:31:26.324]  Yeah, and now they want to tag a bunch of classes onto it.
[02:31:26.504 --> 02:31:31.387]  Well, that turns her right into a privilege, but I would get politically active.
[02:31:31.607 --> 02:31:36.170]  I would try to take over the gun groups in your area, and frankly, I'd move out of California.
[02:31:36.210 --> 02:31:37.751]  That state has already fallen.
[02:31:38.111 --> 02:31:39.572]  Well, I know, huh?
[02:31:39.592 --> 02:31:42.694]  That brings me to actually my next conversation, my next topic.
[02:31:42.734 --> 02:31:44.335]  I was at the airport, the SFO.
[02:31:45.214 --> 02:31:49.535]  And I had to do some business, and I was watching everybody do the kiosk machines.
[02:31:50.236 --> 02:31:52.356]  You know those machines now that tend to do automated check-ins?
[02:31:52.376 --> 02:31:56.338]  Yeah, the trusted traveler electronic ticket cash database.
[02:31:56.978 --> 02:32:09.982]  Yeah, I was kind of noticing how when people were touching, because it's a touch screen only, so I was thinking, oh gosh, you know, fingerprints on the screen, they're staring longingly, deepening into these screens that, you know, could very easily be taking pictures of their eyes if
[02:32:10.942 --> 02:32:11.442]  Not at any other point.
[02:32:11.482 --> 02:32:17.445]  Well, they admit that the Association of Banks in Minnesota is going to make you thumb scan to have a bank account.
[02:32:17.905 --> 02:32:19.165]  They're going to put them in nationwide.
[02:32:19.185 --> 02:32:21.106]  The grocery stores here in Austin are putting them in.
[02:32:21.566 --> 02:32:22.387]  It is the plan.
[02:32:22.907 --> 02:32:28.929]  And yes, the little ink pads they've had you do, that was given to banks free five years ago by the biometric companies.
[02:32:29.509 --> 02:32:30.970]  It's all part of training you.
[02:32:32.831 --> 02:32:35.832]  And I just want to make another comment, and I'll leave you with this.
[02:32:36.072 --> 02:32:40.474]  I was wondering, I've been recently turned on to these chemtrails and whatnot.
[02:32:41.280 --> 02:32:53.843]  And as I was driving to the airport, I just couldn't believe how the sky was just covered with massive amounts of these crisscross lines and circles and X's.
[02:32:53.903 --> 02:32:54.824]  I was so horrified.
[02:32:54.844 --> 02:32:55.924]  I got tons of pictures.
[02:32:56.364 --> 02:32:59.925]  But I was wondering, you know, is everyone else getting sprayed as bad as we are?
[02:33:01.912 --> 02:33:04.753]  Well, I don't know about your particular area, California, but let me just say this.
[02:33:04.813 --> 02:33:16.199]  The government admits thousands of sprays, thousands of incidents of spraying chemicals and biologicals via aircraft and helicopters, different types of aircraft, fixed-wing and rotary, on the American people.
[02:33:17.083 --> 02:33:20.444]  A lot of the spraying you see is just condensation trails, contrails.
[02:33:20.484 --> 02:33:21.564]  There are chemtrails.
[02:33:22.045 --> 02:33:23.625]  They are doing it, and why?
[02:33:24.325 --> 02:33:30.247]  Six, seven years ago, you watch a video or footage of the sky, you don't see the lines, a jet flies over, it disappears.
[02:33:30.627 --> 02:33:37.189]  My whole life, and about five, six years ago, some of the jets fly over at low level, leave a trail, and it sits there for five hours.
[02:33:37.730 --> 02:33:38.750]  Something's going on.
[02:33:38.850 --> 02:33:40.010]  Exactly.
[02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:42.331]  And they have found a lot of garbage in the spring.
[02:33:42.571 --> 02:33:44.172]  That's the kind of stuff I'm talking about.
[02:33:44.192 --> 02:33:45.452]  You know, our local newspaper
[02:33:45.871 --> 02:33:51.293]  You know, said, oh, lovely beach weather and Santa Cruz, and they looked at the sunset and all they had was chemtrails in the background.
[02:33:51.313 --> 02:33:52.113]  They didn't even know.
[02:33:53.794 --> 02:33:57.996]  Yeah, you watch movies from ten years ago, TV shows, photographs, never see it.
[02:33:58.056 --> 02:33:58.876]  Now, everywhere.
[02:33:58.896 --> 02:33:59.496]  Thanks for the call.
[02:33:59.636 --> 02:34:00.017]  No doubt.
[02:34:00.117 --> 02:34:01.517]  It's just so disgusting.
[02:34:02.818 --> 02:34:03.358]  Sue, go ahead.
[02:34:04.318 --> 02:34:04.698]  I'm sorry?
[02:34:05.639 --> 02:34:06.979]  You were finishing up with what you were saying?
[02:34:07.019 --> 02:34:11.081]  Yeah, I was just putting a call out to other people to see how badly it's happening in other cities.
[02:34:11.161 --> 02:34:12.161]  So, thanks for the good work.
[02:34:12.201 --> 02:34:13.562]  I really appreciate the time to speak.
[02:34:14.102 --> 02:34:14.502]  It's good.
[02:34:14.562 --> 02:34:15.023]  Thank you.
[02:34:15.083 --> 02:34:18.265]  Yeah, right when the Gulf War started, it stopped over a lot of the country.
[02:34:18.345 --> 02:34:22.048]  We got reports from around the country, and here there wasn't a one in the sky.
[02:34:22.108 --> 02:34:23.049]  Now they're back.
[02:34:23.869 --> 02:34:24.710]  Bill in Florida.
[02:34:24.730 --> 02:34:25.290]  Last caller.
[02:34:25.310 --> 02:34:26.211]  I've got to cover news then.
[02:34:26.591 --> 02:34:27.392]  Bill, you're on the air.
[02:34:27.432 --> 02:34:27.732]  Welcome.
[02:34:28.113 --> 02:34:28.773]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:34:28.853 --> 02:34:30.654]  I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:34:30.975 --> 02:34:38.260]  I wanted to ask you if you would be interested in reading a copy of the United Nations Exposed.
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:40.101]  It's an old book from back in the early 50s.
[02:34:41.062 --> 02:34:42.783]  Well, sure, I always love stuff like that.
[02:34:43.103 --> 02:34:45.584]  Alright, I'll mail it to your regular mailing address then.
[02:34:45.825 --> 02:34:46.585]  Okay, I'll do that.
[02:34:46.645 --> 02:34:48.026]  I'll get it out to you this week.
[02:34:48.806 --> 02:34:54.269]  The other thing, the other guy in Florida on the NRA, I've run into the same thing.
[02:34:54.329 --> 02:34:55.309]  They sandbag you.
[02:34:55.329 --> 02:34:56.570]  They don't ever call you back.
[02:34:57.130 --> 02:35:03.694]  Best thing I suggest for people to do is to join Gun Owners of America or the Second Amendment Foundation.
[02:35:04.194 --> 02:35:07.315]  They do more fighting against gun control.
[02:35:09.290 --> 02:35:10.210]  Well, let's make it clear.
[02:35:10.290 --> 02:35:13.571]  I get emails from people and I get calls and I can't call them back.
[02:35:13.611 --> 02:35:14.672]  We're totally overwhelmed.
[02:35:15.152 --> 02:35:17.332]  They get mad and think I'm bad because I don't call them back.
[02:35:17.833 --> 02:35:19.233]  It's different with the NRA.
[02:35:19.473 --> 02:35:21.834]  They won't tell you what the gun bills are.
[02:35:22.294 --> 02:35:28.475]  They've got to get thousands of emails and calls for them to finally tell their members in the back of some website what's happening.
[02:35:28.515 --> 02:35:29.776]  So they're loyal opposition.
[02:35:30.096 --> 02:35:31.616]  They are a Trojan horse.
[02:35:31.796 --> 02:35:37.698]  Not the members, as Hal in Florida said, Bill, but the leadership.
[02:35:38.464 --> 02:35:52.309]  Let's see, to get into an organization that's really going to, you know, go after the politicians and fight, you know, for your Second Amendment rights, Gun Owners of America does, I think, does a better job.
[02:35:52.689 --> 02:35:55.850]  Even though I'm a member of NRA, I won't, just won't renew this year.
[02:35:56.490 --> 02:35:59.051]  Well, be sure and tell them why you didn't renew, and thanks for the call, Bill.
[02:35:59.151 --> 02:36:03.913]  Another thing, anybody's looking to get left-handed AR-15s?
[02:36:06.447 --> 02:36:13.229]  DPS Panther Arms makes semi-automatic rifles in left-hand or right-hand version.
[02:36:13.549 --> 02:36:15.050]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:36:15.090 --> 02:36:17.250]  Appreciate it.
[02:36:18.671 --> 02:36:34.176]  There's companies out there that are getting sued by the states, by Republicans like Pataki, by Democrats like Davis, and the companies are going to shut down just like Nabisco is going to have to shut down if we don't pass laws for liability protection.
[02:36:34.196 --> 02:36:35.076]  This is disgusting.
[02:36:35.805 --> 02:36:40.487]  Conspiracy Crusader, Doubt's official 9-1-1 version.
[02:36:40.507 --> 02:36:42.767]  Toronto Star, an amazing article.
[02:36:42.787 --> 02:36:46.289]  There have been other articles in the Canadian paper saying the government did it, basically.
[02:36:48.309 --> 02:36:58.793]  Barry Zweiker gazes calmly into the camera, hands clasped, voice clear and resonant, looking the quintessential Canadian progressive, a colorful
[02:37:00.039 --> 02:37:07.402]  Knitted vest over an open collared shirt, a neat little beard, a personality that radiates boyish, almost naive friendliness.
[02:37:08.222 --> 02:37:15.225]  Not a shard of irony, not a sliver of petulant, up-to-date narcissism.
[02:37:15.705 --> 02:37:16.146]  Perfect!
[02:37:16.186 --> 02:37:19.267]  You couldn't possibly be more agreeable or less threatening.
[02:37:19.387 --> 02:37:24.689]  Then, of course, he runs it all by asking, he ruins it all by asking the question.
[02:37:25.589 --> 02:37:33.752]  They are questions that 99% of Canadian journalists have not dared or been denied to ask.
[02:37:34.052 --> 02:37:37.053]  At the most, Canadians would prefer not to hear.
[02:37:37.353 --> 02:37:38.033]  That's not true.
[02:37:38.633 --> 02:37:45.175]  In these strange times, asking direct and probing questions about 9-1-1 will get you instant put-downs.
[02:37:45.975 --> 02:37:54.118]  Zweiker grins as he mimics the upward eye roll and patronizing hand flip that go along with the phrase conspiracy theorist.
[02:37:54.967 --> 02:38:14.496]  As Vision TV's media critic for the past 15 years, as a journalist with a long list of solid credentials, he's worked at the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star, taught at Ryerson University and was awarded the Southam Fellowship at the University of Toronto, Zweiker should be safely out of line of fire.
[02:38:15.076 --> 02:38:24.300]  It's a measure of his determination to challenge conventional wisdom that he has willingly kept his head up instead of down and tried to look facts right in the eye.
[02:38:25.163 --> 02:38:26.064]  And then there's a quote.
[02:38:26.184 --> 02:38:34.048]  You know, the people who just shrug off these questions with the conspiracy theorist epithet should be asked what they stand for.
[02:38:34.269 --> 02:38:37.170]  Unquestioning acceptance of the official narrative?
[02:38:37.591 --> 02:38:39.792]  Sure, there are outlandish theories out there.
[02:38:40.572 --> 02:38:47.837]  Aliens, Atlantis, but there have also been real and huge conspiracies, Weicker told me in an interview in his home office.
[02:38:49.992 --> 02:38:50.633]  And it goes on.
[02:38:50.653 --> 02:38:52.795]  I knew about some of these conspiracies last January.
[02:38:52.815 --> 02:38:58.040]  I wrote a column about American declassified documents that verify a long history of top-level conspiracies.
[02:38:58.380 --> 02:38:58.660]  The U.S.
[02:38:58.700 --> 02:39:08.370]  government, its military, and its Secret Service have plotted to justify wars and impose their control on other countries through intricate secret schemes of drug-running, gun-smuggling, and assassination.
[02:39:08.690 --> 02:39:12.574]  While Operation Northwoods calls for hijacking jet airliners and crashing them, U.S.
[02:39:12.594 --> 02:39:13.915]  Government-planned ABC News
[02:39:14.435 --> 02:39:22.017]  I even considered rigging fake terrorist attacks that would cost American lives in order to stir up the public to war-ready outrage.
[02:39:22.397 --> 02:39:28.098]  Immediately, I was deluged with hundreds upon hundreds of approving emails from American citizens.
[02:39:28.438 --> 02:39:33.920]  Some of them praised the TV for Zweiker, a Globe and Mail colleague of my youth.
[02:39:34.180 --> 02:39:38.981]  I sat down with a fair degree of skepticism to watch Zweiker's video, The Great Deception,
[02:39:39.461 --> 02:39:40.582]  Which challenges the U.S.
[02:39:40.602 --> 02:39:42.883]  Government's account of what really happened on 9-1-1.
[02:39:43.303 --> 02:39:45.704]  Slowly, a frightening chill came over me.
[02:39:46.845 --> 02:39:55.650]  These were the very questions I had asked myself on 9-1-1, and for several weeks after, failing to find easy answers, I had locked the subject away.
[02:39:56.190 --> 02:40:07.076]  Why did the United States Air Force fail to scramble interceptor jets, in defiance of long-standing rules and well-established practice, for almost two hours after it was known that an unprecedented four planes had been hijacked?
[02:40:07.620 --> 02:40:15.206]  How could the world's most powerful military fail to react throughout the prolonged, horrifying attack on the financial and political capitals of the nation?
[02:40:15.226 --> 02:40:20.470]  How do the FBI know the exact identities of the hijackers within 24 hours of the attacks?
[02:40:21.130 --> 02:40:27.655]  If their files were so readily at hand, why hadn't they been apprehended earlier, after all several
[02:40:29.358 --> 02:40:33.959]  Conscientious FBI agents have raised the alarm about the number of known Al-Qaeda sympathizers at the U.S.
[02:40:33.999 --> 02:40:35.920]  flight schools and have been ignored.
[02:40:36.020 --> 02:40:37.400]  No, they've been threatened with arrest.
[02:40:38.681 --> 02:40:45.002]  Why did Donald Rumsfeld call for a war on Iraq and on Afghanistan the morning after Saudi hijackers had accomplished their attack?
[02:40:45.402 --> 02:40:55.165]  Why did two squadrons of fighter jets at Andrews Air Force Base, 19 kilometers from Washington, not zoom into action to defend the White House, one of their primary targets?
[02:40:55.645 --> 02:40:57.886]  Why did George Bush sit half an hour
[02:40:59.053 --> 02:41:05.097]  In a Florida classroom, watching a girl talk about her pet goat after his chief of staff told him about a second plane.
[02:41:05.557 --> 02:41:14.062]  For that matter, why did he pretend that his first learned of the attacks in that afternoon when he had actually been briefed as he left the hotel that morning, now admitted by the White House?
[02:41:14.742 --> 02:41:21.926]  Why has there been no public investigation of the billions of dollars earned by insider trading of United and American Airlines stock before 9-1-1?
[02:41:23.456 --> 02:41:28.398]  I went to interview Schweiker because I was fascinated by his courage in raising these unpopular questions.
[02:41:28.418 --> 02:41:30.499]  I wanted to know what made him persist.
[02:41:31.059 --> 02:41:32.420]  I saw the answer for myself.
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:35.361]  We'll come back and tell you the answer when we get back.
[02:41:35.421 --> 02:41:35.801]  Stay with me.
[02:41:37.080 --> 02:41:44.464]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:44.724 --> 02:41:49.466]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:49.686 --> 02:41:55.349]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:55.569 --> 02:42:07.475]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:42:07.495 --> 02:42:12.038]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:42:12.198 --> 02:42:14.719]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:42:14.939 --> 02:42:21.663]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:42:21.883 --> 02:42:27.145]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:42:27.165 --> 02:42:27.566]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:42:36.056 --> 02:42:46.783]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:42:46.963 --> 02:42:54.527]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.827 --> 02:42:57.949]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:42:58.229 --> 02:43:03.913]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:43:04.233 --> 02:43:10.376]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:43:10.757 --> 02:43:14.659]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:43:14.699 --> 02:43:16.600]  The water level is always visible.
[02:43:16.760 --> 02:43:22.743]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light, and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:43:22.943 --> 02:43:26.665]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:43:31.988 --> 02:43:32.648]  Stole Free 888-803-4438.
[02:43:52.700 --> 02:43:53.301]  I think so.
[02:44:13.302 --> 02:44:13.922]  That's right.
[02:44:41.527 --> 02:44:58.882]  The article that I was babbling through, I'm not a big news reader like Peter Jennings, ends with the writer saying that he went to basically disprove Zweiker, this renowned journalist in Canada, and found out that there is a cover-up about 9-1-1 and something stinks to high heaven.
[02:44:59.910 --> 02:45:08.155]  And it says, and if you call him a conspiracy theorist, call me one too, because I agree with Zweiker when he says, I don't know exactly what happened, but something smells very fishy.
[02:45:08.736 --> 02:45:16.161]  Even more rank-smelling is the refusal of most Canadian journalists to ask embarrassingly uncool questions about one of the worst catastrophes of our time.
[02:45:17.541 --> 02:45:19.623]  Yeah, like, why was the White House on Cipro?
[02:45:19.843 --> 02:45:21.464]  Why were the hijackers trained at bases?
[02:45:21.804 --> 02:45:25.387]  Why were their homes and cars universally paid for by the FBI?
[02:45:25.847 --> 02:45:27.408]  Why are nine of them still alive?
[02:45:28.439 --> 02:45:30.220]  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:31.180]  It goes on and on.
[02:45:31.220 --> 02:45:50.307]  That's why I had to make two full-length feature, over two hour videos, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, and part two of that, The Masters of Terror, and my 230 page book, The History of Government Sponsored Terrorism, and What Happened on 9-1-1, 9-1-1, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:45:51.248 --> 02:45:54.069]  And you're nuts if you don't get the videos and the book.
[02:45:55.379 --> 02:45:57.020]  Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror.
[02:45:57.100 --> 02:45:58.441]  I know a lot of you haven't gotten it.
[02:45:58.461 --> 02:45:59.722]  You've read all the news articles.
[02:45:59.762 --> 02:46:01.663]  You know there was prior knowledge, bare minimum.
[02:46:02.083 --> 02:46:03.664]  You know who stands to gain from this.
[02:46:03.964 --> 02:46:05.545]  But you haven't gotten the videos.
[02:46:05.905 --> 02:46:07.046]  You haven't made copies.
[02:46:07.066 --> 02:46:08.527]  You haven't gotten them out to people.
[02:46:09.067 --> 02:46:18.313]  When it is changing lives, 90% of those that see the Road to Tyranny, that see the Masters of Terror, are waking up.
[02:46:18.593 --> 02:46:19.534]  Get the films.
[02:46:19.774 --> 02:46:20.834]  Make copies.
[02:46:21.175 --> 02:46:23.136]  Never stop making copies.
[02:46:24.176 --> 02:46:25.217]  Get the truth out.
[02:46:25.357 --> 02:46:34.423]  Tell them about PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com, where they can go download all the news, articles, and documents that are in the films for free.
[02:46:35.744 --> 02:46:38.426]  And there are dozens of other good films that have been made about 9-1-1.
[02:46:38.466 --> 02:46:43.710]  They say mine are the best, most informative, and most dynamic that people will watch, but you can't stop us.
[02:46:43.730 --> 02:46:51.796]  There's dozens of us making the films, thousands of websites putting out good info, hundreds of radio talk show hosts, some more prominent than I,
[02:46:52.538 --> 02:46:57.625]  We're going to keep telling the truth, telling it like it is, because we know the globalists aren't going to stop.
[02:46:57.645 --> 02:47:01.630]  They're going to carry out more and more and more until they get total control of our lives.
[02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:09.820]  So before I hit these final news stories, please call Toll Free and get my videos, and get the new one, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:47:11.207 --> 02:47:13.008]  One of my most comprehensive films yet.
[02:47:13.108 --> 02:47:14.870]  Two hours, 37 minutes long.
[02:47:15.090 --> 02:47:15.290]  Only $25.95.
[02:47:16.791 --> 02:47:19.093]  Order three or more of any of my eight films.
[02:47:19.793 --> 02:47:21.754]  It only drops down to $20.
[02:47:21.814 --> 02:47:22.875]  Only $20 a piece.
[02:47:23.335 --> 02:47:25.317]  The book is only $12 a piece.
[02:47:25.337 --> 02:47:26.317]  Descent into Tyranny.
[02:47:26.838 --> 02:47:27.839]  Make the call.
[02:47:27.859 --> 02:47:27.919]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:47:34.543 --> 02:47:44.694]  That's 888-253-3139, 4infowars.com, or prisonplanet.com to order the films.
[02:47:44.915 --> 02:47:46.737]  Go there, order them today.
[02:47:47.117 --> 02:47:47.738]  Don't wait.
[02:47:47.858 --> 02:47:53.104]  Set about exposing the evil before the globalists continue to carry out more terror to get control of our lives.
[02:47:53.983 --> 02:47:59.308]  Again, 888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or Net, or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:48:10.482 --> 02:48:18.110]  As for this tragic bombings in Saudi Arabia, in Riyadh, it's got globalists written all over it.
[02:48:18.410 --> 02:48:23.075]  We know the globalists had prior knowledge of the Bali bombing, told the Taiwanese not to warn the folks in Bali.
[02:48:23.536 --> 02:48:25.738]  That's on the record on our website's mainstream news.
[02:48:26.198 --> 02:48:30.903]  We know the British are carrying out all the terror attacks against themselves as a police state pretext.
[02:48:31.224 --> 02:48:33.206]  We know the CIA carried out terror attacks.
[02:48:34.087 --> 02:48:35.889]  In Italy to be blind on the left wing.
[02:48:36.329 --> 02:48:38.732]  We know they carried out Oklahoma City to be blind on the right wing.
[02:48:39.253 --> 02:48:40.454]  We know the truth.
[02:48:40.574 --> 02:48:45.641]  We're going to defend America against the enemy combatants that run our government.
[02:48:46.922 --> 02:48:50.066]  Against the usurpers that are overthrowing this country.
[02:48:50.707 --> 02:48:52.189]  We better do it now.
[02:48:53.590 --> 02:48:55.132]  This is the facts.
[02:48:55.212 --> 02:49:04.403]  And by breaking the ice, saying the world is round, saying the official story is a lie, and by asking the important questions, we can save this country.
[02:49:04.423 --> 02:49:07.606]  If we don't back the globalist off, they're going to eat our lunch.
[02:49:07.666 --> 02:49:08.968]  They don't know how to stop.
[02:49:09.248 --> 02:49:13.213]  They already run everything, but they want to totally dehumanize you and your family.
[02:49:13.985 --> 02:49:15.966]  That's the nature of these evil control freaks.
[02:49:16.386 --> 02:49:20.588]  And it's a lot bigger than, than Terry or Bush or any of them.
[02:49:20.608 --> 02:49:21.469]  They're just puppets.
[02:49:21.529 --> 02:49:22.489]  Look above them.
[02:49:22.790 --> 02:49:24.150]  Get past the distraction.
[02:49:24.190 --> 02:49:25.011]  God bless you all.
[02:49:26.451 --> 02:49:28.132]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:49:28.212 --> 02:49:30.693]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[02:49:30.854 --> 02:49:31.554]  It feels great.
[02:49:31.734 --> 02:49:32.755]  Absolutely wonderful.
[02:49:32.835 --> 02:49:37.277]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate.
