[00:00:04.498 --> 00:00:07.671]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.192 --> 00:00:15.832]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.493 --> 00:00:17.553]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.253 --> 00:00:19.494]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:20.014 --> 00:00:20.855]  You want answers?
[00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:23.516]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.536 --> 00:00:26.837]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.338 --> 00:00:31.460]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.764]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:39.984 --> 00:00:40.424]  Welcome.
[00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:42.185]  It is Thursday.
[00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:46.926]  Thursday, the 24th of July, 2003.
[00:00:47.046 --> 00:01:05.114]  We'll be live for the next three hours and we'll cover a mass of vital news and information as we attempt to warn the American people and the people of the world about the perils of the New World Order and its criminal crime syndicates and mechanisms.
[00:01:06.594 --> 00:01:10.496]  Before I take 20 calls on air about this subject, let me just cover it now.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:28.335]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are rarely down, but as the traffic has grown, we've had to expand the size of servers and server farms, and every time we grow out of our britches, we have some problems.
[00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:36.662]  But the current outage, I'm told, is because of some of the backbone of the Internet itself, where our servers are located.
[00:01:36.682 --> 00:01:38.844]  There's a problem in that city.
[00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:56.769]  And we've already gotten a bunch of calls at my office and we've gotten calls at the network and a bunch of emails that people can't get to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and I apologize but that should be up very very soon.
[00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:04.096]  My particular network administrator who never really has this problem but a few times a year to deal with is
[00:02:05.586 --> 00:02:09.089]  It's in another state right now and it's trying to get to a computer to fix it.
[00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.270]  It's been down for a couple hours.
[00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.991]  We just learned of it about 30 minutes ago.
[00:02:13.493 --> 00:02:17.696]  But to know already from another network administrator what the specific problem is.
[00:02:17.816 --> 00:02:19.478]  So that should be back up.
[00:02:19.518 --> 00:02:21.800]  But hey, that's why we have redundancy.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.163]  We're updating InfoWars.net right now.
[00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:29.746]  In the next 30 minutes you'll be able to go read the news we're about to cover at InfoWars.net.
[00:02:30.811 --> 00:02:37.533]  Because Infowars.net and JonesReport.com and other websites that we have are on different servers.
[00:02:39.913 --> 00:02:42.614]  And they're on servers that don't have video and audio clips.
[00:02:42.654 --> 00:02:43.995]  That's what really weighs them down.
[00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:56.518]  So victims of our own success here, generally when this happens every once in a while, this though is because I'm told there's a backbone problem that's affecting a bunch of websites that emanate out of a particular city.
[00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:01.016]  Okay, when we get back I'll get into a bunch of news.
[00:03:01.056 --> 00:03:06.437]  I know for about half the audience that meant nothing because you're not on the computer and don't visit the website every day.
[00:03:06.777 --> 00:03:14.439]  But we post the news we cover there and people like to go read along and check out the bills and legislation for themselves.
[00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.600]  But again, you'll be able to do that at Infowars.net.
[00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:25.006]  Which is not just our ISP company for internet service, but it's also a backup news site that we update as well.
[00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:28.008]  So that's why we have InfoWars.net.
[00:03:29.208 --> 00:03:30.089]  Separate system.
[00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:32.870]  And we're going to start more websites on other servers.
[00:03:33.651 --> 00:03:37.633]  My goal is to have about ten different websites on five or six different servers.
[00:03:38.473 --> 00:03:41.434]  And we're going to be getting that goal completed here in the near future.
[00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:44.416]  Just if we get the time to get it done, we will.
[00:03:45.996 --> 00:03:50.179]  The big news poll shows many Germans see U.S.
[00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.800]  behind September 11.
[00:03:53.702 --> 00:03:59.546]  And I've seen similar major polls out of France, where about 60% of the public believes the U.S.
[00:03:59.586 --> 00:04:01.227]  government carried out 9-1-1.
[00:04:01.748 --> 00:04:03.869]  That's 80-plus million people in that country.
[00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.951]  And 60-plus percent believe the government did it.
[00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:08.332]  Well, no, the government did it.
[00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:09.373]  It's an absolute fact.
[00:04:09.393 --> 00:04:11.014]  68% of Germans believe
[00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:16.232]  That they're being lied to by the press.
[00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:28.779]  A full 30% or people below 30, a large percent of those below 30 believe the government did it as well.
[00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:30.060]  19% of those below 30.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.541]  Bunch of different poll numbers.
[00:04:32.581 --> 00:04:33.942]  I'll go over those for you.
[00:04:34.582 --> 00:04:43.207]  This has got to be upsetting the globalists to have more and more people aware of who carried out those attacks.
[00:04:44.122 --> 00:04:47.044]  And by the way, the numbers are much higher than what you see in these polls.
[00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:54.289]  I mean, over in France, they write books about 9-1-1 and government involvement and sells, you know, 30 million copies.
[00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.392]  There's only 80-something million people in the country, folks.
[00:04:58.793 --> 00:05:06.358]  And you can say whatever you want about the Europeans, but they know about the New World Order, they know how corrupt their governments are, and they know how corrupt our government is.
[00:05:06.838 --> 00:05:07.579]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:10.655 --> 00:05:14.558]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:05:14.778 --> 00:05:20.222]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:05:20.482 --> 00:05:30.849]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:35.352]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:05:35.672 --> 00:05:35.912]  I think?
[00:05:56.237 --> 00:05:58.778]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:58.798 --> 00:06:01.778]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:01.798 --> 00:06:03.879]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[00:06:03.899 --> 00:06:04.359]  A New World Order.
[00:06:25.796 --> 00:06:27.298]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:40.896 --> 00:06:41.336]  We're good to go.
[00:07:09.933 --> 00:07:13.536]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:07:13.776 --> 00:07:15.197]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:07:15.677 --> 00:07:17.098]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:07:17.379 --> 00:07:22.543]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:07:22.903 --> 00:07:27.386]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:07:27.706 --> 00:07:36.353]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:07:36.853 --> 00:07:37.994]  Gum disease is serious.
[00:07:38.474 --> 00:07:42.216]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[00:07:42.497 --> 00:07:49.121]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[00:07:49.461 --> 00:07:53.503]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[00:07:53.944 --> 00:07:55.905]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.
[00:07:56.165 --> 00:07:56.945]  Call toll-free 800-569-4340.
[00:07:56.965 --> 00:07:58.766]  That's 800-569-4340 or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:17.655]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:18.255 --> 00:08:21.317]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.181 --> 00:08:35.688]  Alright folks, we're now 8 minutes and 20 seconds into the first hour of this Thursday worldwide edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:35.888 --> 00:08:36.929]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:40.172]  Thank you for joining us today and for the
[00:08:40.845 --> 00:08:51.794]  Folks that listen to us in different time zones when this broadcast is rebroadcast or for those that listen to us on stations that re-air these shows on the weekend, welcome to the show.
[00:08:51.854 --> 00:08:59.221]  You're always welcome to tune in weekdays from 11 to 2 Central during the day and back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:08:59.241 --> 00:09:05.906]  You're always welcome to call in while we are live and then hear yourself played back later in your area.
[00:09:07.007 --> 00:09:07.808]  And again folks,
[00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:12.646]  We are going out on the AM and FM dial on a growing list of AM and FM affiliates.
[00:09:13.387 --> 00:09:22.035]  Simulcasting on Global Shortwave during the day from 11 to 2 Central Time on 12.172 and 93.20 and back from 9 to midnight at 5.085 and 68.90 and you can always listen to us on the internet streaming
[00:09:32.173 --> 00:09:32.896]  We're good to go.
[00:09:40.309 --> 00:10:03.782]  on the backbone of the internet near our servers and so InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are not accessible by most that should be up in the near future today you can go to our mirror site or our alternative server and that's InfoWars.net so if you ever go to PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com and they're down which is a rarity
[00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:11.234]  But as they grow, it's happened a few times, you can simply visit Infowars.net.
[00:10:12.835 --> 00:10:18.558]  Okay, let me go ahead and jump into the news, and there is a lot of it today, and it is all extremely important.
[00:10:20.299 --> 00:10:21.999]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.981]  Poll shows many Germans see U.S.
[00:10:26.582 --> 00:10:28.443]  behind September 11.
[00:10:30.991 --> 00:10:34.573]  Poll shows many Germans see U.S.
[00:10:34.713 --> 00:10:37.294]  behind September 11th.
[00:10:37.334 --> 00:10:38.414]  That's a big deal!
[00:10:40.075 --> 00:10:45.797]  And it says that 68% of all Germans don't trust the media and think that there's a cover-up.
[00:10:45.877 --> 00:10:52.520]  And about 20% of Germans in all age groups hold the view that the U.S.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.161]  government carried out September 11th.
[00:10:55.459 --> 00:11:00.201]  One in three Germans below the age of 30 believe the U.S.
[00:11:00.221 --> 00:11:02.421]  government carried out the attacks.
[00:11:02.501 --> 00:11:15.926]  So one-third under 30, 20% over all the German people in all age groups and demographics, and 68% think there's a cover-up and smell a rat, they're just not sure.
[00:11:17.607 --> 00:11:24.809]  Well, let me tell you, I've done my own little poll nationwide on over a thousand AM and FM stations that I've been
[00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:28.683]  That I've been interviewed on as a guest.
[00:11:28.723 --> 00:11:43.470]  Some of them syndicated, some of them little mom and pop AMs, some of them big 50,000 watt blowtorches in New York or Rhode Island or KOA or KFI, I mean LA, Denver, you name it.
[00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.672]  A lot of you have heard me on those shows and I'll be on the big ones for two hours.
[00:11:49.082 --> 00:11:52.944]  Prime time, middle of the night, in the morning, in the afternoon, doesn't matter.
[00:11:53.324 --> 00:11:54.045]  Open the phones.
[00:11:54.185 --> 00:11:55.346]  They'll take 30 calls.
[00:11:55.606 --> 00:11:57.247]  Everybody agrees but one person.
[00:11:57.667 --> 00:11:59.908]  They'll say I should be arrested and I should be killed.
[00:11:59.928 --> 00:12:02.530]  I mean, you've heard them on the air.
[00:12:02.570 --> 00:12:03.430]  You should be killed.
[00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:04.191]  You're a traitor.
[00:12:05.051 --> 00:12:06.512]  If I ever see you, I'll kill you.
[00:12:07.253 --> 00:12:08.433]  I get emails like that.
[00:12:08.693 --> 00:12:10.054]  You're working with Al Qaeda.
[00:12:11.515 --> 00:12:18.279]  Because I expose that our government is Al Qaeda, and controls Al Qaeda, and is not our government, and is carrying out the attacks.
[00:12:19.008 --> 00:12:29.838]  Firefighters, SWAT team people, school teachers, guys that work at the local newspaper call in, people with British accents, people with Caribbean accents.
[00:12:29.878 --> 00:12:31.079]  I mean, they all call in.
[00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:32.440]  Yes, you're right.
[00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:33.761]  I knew it day one.
[00:12:33.881 --> 00:12:34.842]  I've seen the evidence.
[00:12:35.183 --> 00:12:40.027]  They point out key pieces of evidence from the plethora of the cornucopia of evidence.
[00:12:41.849 --> 00:12:44.254]  I mean, I just hope the globalists realize that.
[00:12:44.294 --> 00:12:50.326]  That they can lie all day and put their spin on it all day and they can blow more stuff up and kill more people and we hope they don't.
[00:12:50.948 --> 00:12:54.049]  And tell us how they're saving us and telling us we need to love them.
[00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:59.392]  They can put the gun to our head of terrorism and say, capitulate to tyranny or it's over.
[00:12:59.752 --> 00:13:05.175]  But I'm here to tell you, a lot of people are afraid to stand up in church and talk about it.
[00:13:05.475 --> 00:13:07.996]  And they're afraid to stand up in their classroom and talk about it.
[00:13:08.376 --> 00:13:10.577]  And they're afraid to talk about it in the grocery store.
[00:13:10.897 --> 00:13:15.780]  But when I'm on 1,000 plus interviews, it's well over 1,000 now.
[00:13:18.158 --> 00:13:23.099]  Multiple interviews a day in the last 23 months since September 11th.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.660]  And I did hundreds of interviews before that.
[00:13:27.361 --> 00:13:31.942]  Probably 500, 600 in all the years before that and things have just accelerated since then.
[00:13:33.042 --> 00:13:34.263]  And think about that.
[00:13:34.503 --> 00:13:35.563]  You talk about a poll.
[00:13:35.623 --> 00:13:42.525]  They call a big poll 5,000 people or 1,002 people or all these different polling numbers we see.
[00:13:44.455 --> 00:13:52.062]  I've done interviews on the most conservative talk shows, you know, on Kogo and WABC.
[00:13:53.563 --> 00:13:54.424]  I've been everywhere.
[00:13:56.145 --> 00:13:58.627]  Pacifica Radio for two hours.
[00:14:00.289 --> 00:14:02.070]  Public Radio in Austin.
[00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:03.211]  Everywhere.
[00:14:04.472 --> 00:14:05.453]  All over the place.
[00:14:06.234 --> 00:14:07.755]  Over a thousand interviews.
[00:14:08.812 --> 00:14:12.877]  And most interviews, we'll take 20 calls, 10 calls, 15 calls.
[00:14:13.418 --> 00:14:15.761]  I'm on for 30 minutes, we'll take 10 calls, 5 calls.
[00:14:16.241 --> 00:14:17.263]  No one disagrees!
[00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.810]  You'd start taking thirty calls.
[00:14:20.351 --> 00:14:22.671]  In two hours, maybe one guy gets in.
[00:14:23.131 --> 00:14:43.416]  Now there's the exception of where, you know, I'll be in some really conservative backwoods area, where they aren't real conservatives, but they're well-meaning people, they don't understand their neocons, they're the new super liberal that doesn't even know they're liberal, and I tell them, Bush wants your guns, and they'll call in and go, well that's fine, squirrel!
[00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:46.958]  Yeah, you ought to leave Texas, boy!
[00:14:46.978 --> 00:14:49.480]  Where are you from, New York City?
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:55.124]  You know, this guy's probably from New York a generation ago, walking around in his big cowboy hat telling me that.
[00:14:56.686 --> 00:14:58.487]  But that's the kind of stuff I get.
[00:14:58.507 --> 00:15:06.333]  I mean, that's about... It's resistance to the facts is almost zero, folks.
[00:15:08.226 --> 00:15:13.129]  A thousand interviews and maybe a hundred callers that disagree with me.
[00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:14.350]  Maybe a hundred.
[00:15:15.751 --> 00:15:16.071]  I don't know.
[00:15:16.091 --> 00:15:21.195]  I've been on a few stations where there'll be two or three that call them where they're really stupid or dumbed down or mindless.
[00:15:21.775 --> 00:15:24.737]  Okay, maybe 150 callers that really disagreed.
[00:15:25.578 --> 00:15:38.142]  Out of thousands, and thousands, and thousands, and thousands, and thousands, and thousands, and thousands, and thousands, and thousands, and thousands, I'm a liberal, I'm a conservative, I'm a libertarian, I'm a police officer, I'm a firefighter.
[00:15:38.723 --> 00:15:43.884]  Yeah, Bill Clinton blew up Oklahoma City, I'm on the SWAT team, on the bomb squad, that was obvious, we all know it.
[00:15:44.164 --> 00:15:48.606]  We got your tapes here in Orlando, on the Orlando SWAT team.
[00:15:49.266 --> 00:15:50.687]  You know, calls like that.
[00:15:51.327 --> 00:15:54.288]  I work here at the Denver Post, and we all know Bush did it, you know.
[00:15:56.451 --> 00:16:03.352]  So here's Reuters, and I don't mean to get off into this diatribe for ten minutes, but think about it.
[00:16:04.072 --> 00:16:11.334]  That's a big deal, folks, that they can say we're all buying these lies, but it's just not the case.
[00:16:12.234 --> 00:16:16.455]  And yeah, there's going to be people who buy the hype and mindlessly jump into it.
[00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:23.756]  I mean, I'm seeing a lot of soccer moms, a lot of liberals that are the biggest supporters of the neocons right now.
[00:16:25.965 --> 00:16:29.566]  And I know a lot of Democrats that are now going, I like Bush.
[00:16:30.046 --> 00:16:30.506]  You see?
[00:16:30.666 --> 00:16:31.986]  Because you're stupid.
[00:16:33.047 --> 00:16:38.728]  And if you can get conned by Bill Clinton, you're going to get conned by Mr. Satan Claus.
[00:16:40.068 --> 00:16:43.129]  But polls show many Germans see U.S.
[00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:44.549]  behind September 11th.
[00:16:44.609 --> 00:16:45.289]  Berlin.
[00:16:46.169 --> 00:16:48.430]  This is from yesterday, July 23rd, Reuters.
[00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.111]  And it's up on Infowars.net, our backup site.
[00:16:53.735 --> 00:16:57.836]  Almost one in three Germans below the age of 30 believes the U.S.
[00:16:57.876 --> 00:17:06.318]  government may have sponsored the September 11, 2001 attacks on the New York and Washington, according to a poll published on Wednesday.
[00:17:07.018 --> 00:17:11.059]  And about 20% of Germans in all age groups hold this view.
[00:17:11.499 --> 00:17:18.301]  A survey of 1,000 people conducted for the weekly Die Zette said, major weekly
[00:17:19.951 --> 00:17:32.535]  It also said 68% of all Germans felt that the media had not reported the full truth behind the attacks in which some 3,000 people were killed when hijacked planes were crashed into the World Trade Center in the Pentagon.
[00:17:33.315 --> 00:17:40.877]  By the way, Germany's technology minister, about 20 months ago, put out a report.
[00:17:40.917 --> 00:17:42.277]  He didn't just make a statement.
[00:17:43.117 --> 00:17:45.778]  And by the way, part of his report is in that George Humphrey
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:46.941]  We're good to go.
[00:17:54.767 --> 00:17:59.548]  The German Technology Minister, and the guy's got all these awards, I mean, he's got a head the size of a watermelon.
[00:18:00.389 --> 00:18:01.089]  He's got like a 170 IQ.
[00:18:01.109 --> 00:18:03.910]  He came out and he said, it is impossible.
[00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:05.750]  The story is a fraud.
[00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:08.451]  The military-industrial complex launched these attacks.
[00:18:08.831 --> 00:18:11.232]  I have conducted a detailed analysis.
[00:18:11.592 --> 00:18:19.194]  Well, so have we, and so have all these other engineers, and hundreds of military officers, and everybody else, including the Easter Bunny.
[00:18:19.881 --> 00:18:29.329]  And it would be easier for me to fly to the moon, okay, by gluing feathers on my back.
[00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:30.910]  I'm not joking.
[00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:31.610]  I'm serious.
[00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:42.980]  It would be easier for fire ants to build a rocket in your backyard and go to Mars than for all these things to happen that happen when you add them all together.
[00:18:44.381 --> 00:18:44.641]  Okay?
[00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.351]  In fact, when in Portugal, hundreds of former U.S.
[00:18:48.371 --> 00:18:55.814]  military officers and others met and had a 76-hour press conference until people almost collapsed, detailing all the evidence there's so much.
[00:18:57.155 --> 00:18:58.855]  This was in major Portugal newspapers.
[00:18:58.895 --> 00:18:59.715]  They met over there.
[00:19:00.996 --> 00:19:02.136]  And they went over all this.
[00:19:03.577 --> 00:19:08.499]  They said that the Pentagon could probably only carry this out one out of three tries.
[00:19:09.979 --> 00:19:10.420]  Okay?
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.961]  It's that sophisticated, that type of precision.
[00:19:15.603 --> 00:19:19.706]  Just down the line, just the G's being pulled by the aircraft.
[00:19:20.306 --> 00:19:22.808]  Fighter jocks watched that and said, I couldn't do that.
[00:19:23.349 --> 00:19:40.661]  Oh, but all three of them hit just right and do these double swoop, you know, twist, double twist right into the Pentagon perfectly and right into the World Trade Centers with their beacons turned off and NORAD standing down.
[00:19:40.701 --> 00:19:42.282]  It just goes on and on forever.
[00:19:43.394 --> 00:19:45.976]  It goes on and on forever.
[00:19:47.738 --> 00:19:48.818]  Asked whether they believe the U.S.
[00:19:48.838 --> 00:19:52.762]  government could have ordered the Supreme Court to allow the tax itself.
[00:19:52.782 --> 00:19:53.682]  31% of those surveyed.
[00:19:53.702 --> 00:19:56.164]  And the poll answered yes.
[00:19:58.226 --> 00:19:59.267]  Oh my goodness.
[00:19:59.727 --> 00:20:01.809]  I mean, come on folks!
[00:20:02.729 --> 00:20:04.971]  Look, they can keep saying the world's flat.
[00:20:06.172 --> 00:20:09.675]  They can kill me tomorrow, but everybody's going to know they carried these attacks out.
[00:20:12.495 --> 00:20:13.015]  It's here.
[00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:14.016]  It's powerful.
[00:20:14.316 --> 00:20:22.882]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[00:20:23.182 --> 00:20:25.023]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.

[00:20:27.645 --> 00:20:31.868]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[00:20:32.168 --> 00:20:37.851]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:39.832]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[00:20:39.992 --> 00:20:43.214]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.

[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.681]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:22:12.102 --> 00:22:16.465]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:22:16.745 --> 00:22:22.528]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:26.831]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:22:27.111 --> 00:22:32.775]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[00:22:32.875 --> 00:22:35.497]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:22:37.598 --> 00:22:41.480]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:43.902]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:22:44.242 --> 00:22:46.543]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:22:46.943 --> 00:22:50.565]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:22:51.046 --> 00:22:57.249]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:22:57.689 --> 00:22:58.650]  You'll be glad you did.

[00:22:59.470 --> 00:22:59.710]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:08.414 --> 00:23:09.455]  What would you rather do?
[00:23:09.795 --> 00:23:12.718]  Spend 10 minutes learning how to become debt-free within two years?

[00:24:21.366 --> 00:24:24.787]  Well, today the website is InfoWars.net, folks.
[00:24:24.827 --> 00:24:25.907]  Be sure to go visit it.
[00:24:27.908 --> 00:24:31.148]  We're updating it right now with the news articles we're covering.
[00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:36.610]  I'm about to go to Joe and Mike and Tom and Mike and Roger and many others.
[00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.731]  A total free number to join us on air today.
[00:24:40.771 --> 00:24:42.711]  We're going to have wide open phones to cover the news.
[00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:42.771]  800-259-9231.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:51.563]  Again, they can imprison people, they can kill people, they can try to intimidate folks.
[00:24:52.504 --> 00:24:58.328]  Everyone is going to know that the government carried out September 11th.
[00:24:58.368 --> 00:25:15.080]  It isn't like Pearl Harbor where they let it happen and attacked Japanese submarines that morning in the harbor and tried to cover it up and ordered the military to stand down and had the communique 12 days before that Admiral Yamamoto was going to attack that morning of December 7th.
[00:25:16.886 --> 00:25:21.410]  It's not like, you know, stuff like that that comes out 50, 60 years later.
[00:25:22.331 --> 00:25:45.110]  No, we're all going to know, and we're all going to know it now, in the next few months, because when you've got almost the entire country of France saying the US government carried out 9-1-1, and when you've got a majority of Germans, 68% saying they're being lied to, and over a third of the people saying they think the government did it,
[00:25:46.201 --> 00:25:51.084]  And that's just a mainstream poll, and I'm on a thousand radio shows.
[00:25:51.584 --> 00:25:53.925]  A thousand radio shows?
[00:25:54.885 --> 00:26:01.189]  Oh, granted, I was probably on seven hundred and something radio shows, because some of them are repeats, but total thousands of interviews.
[00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:04.130]  Think about that.
[00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.432]  Think about being on a station like KOA out of Denver.
[00:26:07.452 --> 00:26:10.133]  It covers thirty-something states.
[00:26:10.153 --> 00:26:15.736]  I mean, you're getting calls from California, from Louisiana, from Indiana.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.424]  And every person saying, yeah, the government blew it up, the government did it, they're a bunch of thugs, the cameras are going up, they're taking our rights!
[00:26:24.245 --> 00:26:25.646]  Think about how big that is!
[00:26:25.746 --> 00:26:37.554]  So, let them keep lying, let them keep licking their lips and reading off the teleprompters and all their neocon scams and lying liberal New World Order scams, let them keep... and you know what?
[00:26:37.574 --> 00:26:42.317]  They're going to do even more horrible things to make us love them, to pose as our saviors.
[00:26:42.977 --> 00:26:48.224]  But the genie's out of the bottle, Pandora's box is open, and the truth?
[00:26:48.745 --> 00:26:49.926]  You can't kill it.
[00:26:50.107 --> 00:26:51.649]  It isn't gonna go away.
[00:26:52.089 --> 00:26:54.072]  You just watch.
[00:26:54.152 --> 00:26:57.676]  No matter how horrible the stuff is, you pull, boys.
[00:26:58.377 --> 00:27:24.320]  No matter how bad it gets, more people are going to blame you because you are the enemy combatants, you are the terrorists, you are the usurpers, you are the overthrowers of the Republic, you are the traitors and the seditious enemy agents of the private corporation, the crime syndicate known as the New World Order.
[00:27:27.296 --> 00:27:28.456]  So knock yourselves out.
[00:27:28.536 --> 00:27:32.637]  Speaking of 9-1-1, here's an article out of the Baltimore Sun today.
[00:27:32.837 --> 00:27:34.097]  FAA OKs.
[00:27:35.878 --> 00:27:38.999]  That's right, FAA OKs for drones.
[00:27:40.539 --> 00:27:44.100]  FAA OKs sought for drones.
[00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:50.121]  Warriors, pilotless military aircraft, can have valuable civilian uses.
[00:27:50.922 --> 00:27:57.146]  In the petroleum industry, in law enforcement, and in homeland security, their makers say.
[00:27:57.586 --> 00:28:02.569]  And Senator Warner, three months ago, started the funding process, and guess what?
[00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.691]  There are drones over Austin every day now.
[00:28:05.751 --> 00:28:11.035]  You can get your binoculars out and watch them by model number flying around.
[00:28:11.055 --> 00:28:13.936]  They love us, and that was in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:28:13.976 --> 00:28:16.418]  The drones are already in our skies, unmanned.
[00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:25.194]  Flying around for and they're going to monitor and for the public they announced oh it's just for traffic and then down the article and for law enforcement.
[00:28:25.214 --> 00:28:37.741]  I have an article on the drones today where they admit that they're being fitted with the high-tech resonance systems that shoot out some shoot out a form of radiation others
[00:28:38.567 --> 00:28:47.495]  Well, I guess everything's a form of radiation, but it says they shoot out a particular type of radiation ray, and it gives them a crisp color image of the inside of your house.
[00:28:47.856 --> 00:28:50.998]  Forget that old black and white stuff that the high-powered radar does.
[00:28:51.559 --> 00:28:52.920]  Nice, crisp images.
[00:28:53.381 --> 00:28:54.922]  It's all part of the free society.
[00:28:55.262 --> 00:29:00.067]  In your bed, in the shower, in the bathroom, eating dinner, watching TV, high-powered,
[00:29:00.887 --> 00:29:05.411]  Systems flying around, just scanning, looking through with x-ray vision.
[00:29:05.672 --> 00:29:06.973]  It's what a free society is.
[00:29:07.313 --> 00:29:08.394]  The veterans fought.
[00:29:08.874 --> 00:29:09.955]  The Soviet Union.
[00:29:10.416 --> 00:29:12.538]  We fought in Vietnam and Korea.
[00:29:13.599 --> 00:29:17.302]  So we could have planes looking through our walls.
[00:29:19.013 --> 00:29:20.674]  Through four feet of concrete, by the way.
[00:29:20.994 --> 00:29:23.136]  The Ground Penetrating Radar, as it's called.
[00:29:23.676 --> 00:29:25.137]  A nice little black and white image.
[00:29:25.177 --> 00:29:30.401]  But now I have an article here about the new stuff they're going to mount in the police helicopters and in the drones.
[00:29:30.961 --> 00:29:32.102]  Small little units.
[00:29:32.882 --> 00:29:36.665]  It does send out some radiation, but after all, that's good for you.
[00:29:37.546 --> 00:29:40.227]  Radiating the beef is even better for the school children.
[00:29:41.288 --> 00:29:43.870]  So, uh, we'll get into that.
[00:29:44.773 --> 00:29:46.194]  You know, little drones.
[00:29:46.254 --> 00:29:49.456]  It's like the movie They Live, but hey, that was a movie about freedom!
[00:29:50.416 --> 00:29:54.558]  So was 1984, that book where the helicopter flies around looking through your windows.
[00:29:55.078 --> 00:29:57.119]  Hey, a hallmark of liberty, folks!
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.740]  We'll be right back!
[00:30:00.741 --> 00:30:01.682]  We're on the march.
[00:30:02.142 --> 00:30:03.763]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.663 --> 00:30:07.345]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.615 --> 00:30:13.358]  Americans, are you fed up with Big Brother watching you like a hawk?
[00:30:13.598 --> 00:30:19.904]  Have you ever asked yourself why you're being tracked, categorized, numbered, classified, registered, and licensed by the government?
[00:30:20.205 --> 00:30:23.128]  Would you like to make your ass like... 803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:30:23.268 --> 00:30:24.529]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:30:34.415 --> 00:30:34.915]  Don't worry.
[00:30:35.375 --> 00:30:36.896]  This show is documented.
[00:30:37.416 --> 00:30:40.197]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:40.577 --> 00:30:44.118]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:30:44.138 --> 00:30:51.000]  I went down, down, down to the flames where I burned.
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:55.801]  I know, ladies and gentlemen, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are down.
[00:30:57.002 --> 00:31:01.703]  And we think it's because of some type of backbone situation in our area of the south.
[00:31:02.506 --> 00:31:06.590]  We're told there's some other problems with other sites that emanate out of this area.
[00:31:07.151 --> 00:31:13.016]  But in the past, I mean, we'd go six months without it being down, you know, at midnight or something and have to reboot it sometimes.
[00:31:13.577 --> 00:31:23.426]  But lately, because the sites are getting tens of millions of visitors every month, and I'm not kidding, folks, it's now into millions and millions of individual people.
[00:31:24.885 --> 00:31:31.648]  It's getting ridiculous, and we're going to have to get even bigger servers if it's a server problem, and it's getting very expensive.
[00:31:32.048 --> 00:31:34.029]  Now, I've never really talked about this on the air.
[00:31:34.089 --> 00:31:46.194]  That's why you need to buy my products, my videos, my books, the stuff that we sell on the shopping carts, and that you can order via the toll-free number, and that you can order via mail.
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.501]  Because this is a ministry.
[00:31:49.541 --> 00:31:51.302]  This is about getting the information out.
[00:31:51.462 --> 00:31:53.143]  That's my first and foremost goal.
[00:31:53.163 --> 00:32:00.726]  That's why I say you can make copies of my videos for non-profit, educational, not-for-sale purposes.
[00:32:01.267 --> 00:32:02.667]  That's why I do that.
[00:32:02.767 --> 00:32:04.788]  Because I really want to defeat the New World Order.
[00:32:04.848 --> 00:32:05.969]  I don't like it that they killed
[00:32:07.078 --> 00:32:09.519]  Uh, just under 3,000 people on 9-1-1.
[00:32:09.539 --> 00:32:20.865]  I don't like it that Roosevelt signed a document ordering that 7,000 women and children be left in the Philippines, quote, for propaganda usage, because, quote, if the Japanese capture them, that will be great for newsreels.
[00:32:20.925 --> 00:32:22.346]  By the way, that's what the document says.
[00:32:22.726 --> 00:32:23.667]  New York Daily News.
[00:32:23.967 --> 00:32:24.747]  Came out last year.
[00:32:24.767 --> 00:32:27.329]  You know, I'm upset about stuff like that, you know?
[00:32:28.309 --> 00:32:31.751]  And, uh, we're gonna expose the serial killers here, okay?
[00:32:33.058 --> 00:32:34.459]  But we need your help to get it done.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:39.705]  But InfoWars.net, our backup site, is up and being updated right now with all the news we're going to cover.
[00:32:39.725 --> 00:32:43.028]  A little bit late today because of the problem, but that's going to happen.
[00:32:43.208 --> 00:32:44.730]  So, yes, I know about it.
[00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:48.814]  I don't want to have to keep addressing it, but I will or I'm going to keep getting all these calls.
[00:32:50.583 --> 00:32:55.006]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in New York, then we'll go to Mike, Tom, Roger, and others.
[00:32:55.046 --> 00:32:55.747]  Go ahead, Joe.
[00:32:56.207 --> 00:32:56.587]  Yeah, hi.
[00:32:56.607 --> 00:32:57.248]  How are you doing?
[00:32:57.388 --> 00:32:58.168]  Pretty good, my friend.
[00:32:58.368 --> 00:32:58.648]  All right.
[00:32:58.989 --> 00:33:12.478]  Let me ask you, do you have any impression or maybe some of your contacts in the government or whomever, maybe some of these high-level, maybe mid-level minions who are getting cold feet?
[00:33:13.298 --> 00:33:14.639]  Well, they are.
[00:33:14.659 --> 00:33:16.100]  I mean, I don't have
[00:33:18.126 --> 00:33:25.328]  Specifics, because I can't give you specifics in the places that I have specifics, but they've been all over the news blowing the whistles.
[00:33:26.589 --> 00:33:42.053]  What I'm saying is, I can't give you the people I know personally deep inside government because they're sources, but I can tell you about Robert Wright at the National Press Club on C-SPAN, FBI agent crying and saying, if I tell you what I know about 9-1-1, I'll be arrested.
[00:33:42.113 --> 00:33:43.554]  Here's the letter from Ashcroft.
[00:33:44.495 --> 00:34:02.029]  I can't tell you about the other FBI agents I've talked to, but I can talk about David Shippers, I can talk about Robert Wright, I can talk about what Judicial Watch has said, I can talk about Stanley Hilton, who's interviewed over a hundred, NORAD, FBI, and others that say Bush carried the attacks out.
[00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:08.395]  That's Bob Dole's former Chief of Staff, by the way, suing Bush, not for prior knowledge, but for running the attacks.
[00:34:09.075 --> 00:34:13.516]  I can tell you about that, but I can't tell you about the internal sources I have.
[00:34:14.336 --> 00:34:18.418]  But frankly, it's been duplicated so many times, I don't even want to talk to them anymore.
[00:34:18.718 --> 00:34:20.858]  It's dangerous for me, it's dangerous for them.
[00:34:21.198 --> 00:34:22.118]  We know who did it.
[00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:34.782]  The evidence, the prima facie evidence, it's like going to a crime scene that's an orgy of evidence, as they say, and you've got the killer there at the dinner table eating the body of the person they've killed.
[00:34:36.764 --> 00:34:39.810]  And they've shot 500 hours of video of it!
[00:34:41.514 --> 00:34:42.436]  It's ridiculous!
[00:34:42.496 --> 00:34:43.738]  It's an orgy of evidence!
[00:34:44.853 --> 00:35:01.598]  Which, which, which, I actually have pierced the veil on psychological warfare parameters, and I believe it's actually a judo move by high-level Illuminati that this is meant to come out, and at a certain level, we're empowering the Illuminati on this broadcast, unless we're conscious of this.
[00:35:02.138 --> 00:35:05.899]  Do you know how we're empowering the Illuminati?
[00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:08.419]  Joe?
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.901]  Okay, let me tell you how we're empowering the Illuminati, unless we're conscious of this.
[00:35:15.328 --> 00:35:35.678]  Number one, we are engaging in revelation of the method and mass desensitization to an overall horror that the subconscious is already aware of, so we are being allowed to do this, to introduce it, so that there is not a mass insanity that then causes a break into open rebellion.
[00:35:35.958 --> 00:35:39.560]  Now that's on one level, but again it's overheating their system and
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:43.462]  There is a sub-twist in the twist, and it's blown up in their face.
[00:35:43.762 --> 00:35:44.643]  Ha, ha, ha!
[00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.464]  Now, this is very dangerous.
[00:35:46.844 --> 00:35:52.728]  Now, at another level, what happens is the New World Order wants to discredit America.
[00:35:53.048 --> 00:35:55.589]  The New World Order wants to demonize America.
[00:35:56.030 --> 00:36:04.515]  And for some of the unsophisticated minds in the world, and the liberals, and some of the Europeans, who are more sophisticated but are still not sophisticated enough,
[00:36:05.095 --> 00:36:12.281]  They hear and think that America, the red, white, and blue carried out 9-1-1, thus America's bad, the U.N.
[00:36:12.361 --> 00:36:13.802]  is good, then the U.N.
[00:36:13.842 --> 00:36:19.387]  comes out against the war, against the imperial moves, against the lies, and makes the U.N.
[00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:28.354]  look good, so in a judo move, they take the energy and allow 9-1-1 evidence to come out, they allow it to sit there simmering, destroying America's
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:41.487]  Outlook and the view people have of America worldwide, while empowering the more centralized arms of the New World Order.
[00:36:41.547 --> 00:36:42.127]  Is that clear?
[00:36:42.488 --> 00:36:43.008]  Yes, indeed.
[00:36:43.769 --> 00:36:45.089]  Okay, what else is on your mind, Joe?
[00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:55.136]  Well, I guess yesterday you had that gentleman from Canada calling you a traitor and a coward, blah, blah, blah, because you weren't going along, you weren't a Bush worshipper supporter.
[00:36:55.497 --> 00:36:58.839]  I found this really interesting comment by Theodore Roosevelt.
[00:36:59.406 --> 00:37:12.099]  Where he said, to announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.
[00:37:12.119 --> 00:37:13.120]  I thought that was very interesting.
[00:37:15.334 --> 00:37:23.140]  And he did say that quote during an election, and did point out that it was very patriotic to criticize the government.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:41.415]  The Founding Fathers say in the Declaration of Independence, the Bill of Rights, and the Constitution, that we are the government, and when the government becomes destructive of the Republic, it is our right, our duty, not to overthrow the Constitution and the Republic, but to restore it against the usurpers.
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.560]  All right, great show Alex.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.101]  Hey Joe, thank you so much.
[00:37:46.962 --> 00:38:00.288]  And without all the little psychological terms and things, revelation of the method, psychological subconscious judo moves, without going into all that, it borders on hyperbole, let me boil it down simply.
[00:38:01.508 --> 00:38:07.651]  There has been a long-term plan by the left to demonize and destroy the institutions of America, okay?
[00:38:08.252 --> 00:38:13.094]  And worldwide, anything that's decent, anything that's basic, anything that's innate.
[00:38:13.826 --> 00:38:14.306]  Family.
[00:38:16.767 --> 00:38:21.709]  The real political paradigm of command-and-control slavery versus freedom.
[00:38:22.009 --> 00:38:24.510]  That's the real political paradigm, the real political spectrum.
[00:38:25.151 --> 00:38:35.855]  They have tried to replace it, you know, like programming a computer full of garbage in false semantical terms, where you can't even come to a rational decision or thinking process, okay?
[00:38:36.215 --> 00:38:38.816]  They've literally scrambled brains out there.
[00:38:39.056 --> 00:38:43.238]  That's why some of these people, you can't talk to them, because they don't have minds.
[00:38:44.833 --> 00:38:53.839]  But they don't count because they are literal cogs, drooling fools, and as sheepdogs, we're not wolves, we don't want to abuse them, we want to protect them.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:39:00.563]  And we understand they're a dangerous tool focused at us, like a pack of lemmings, to run us over the cliff with them.
[00:39:01.324 --> 00:39:13.972]  A stampeding herd of buffalo, or woolly mammoths going off the side of the cliff, driven by the drum beaters of the New World Order, so they can have delightful feasts.
[00:39:15.817 --> 00:39:20.641]  Okay, now I'm getting into anthropology, but again, I'm trying to make this as simple as possible.
[00:39:21.862 --> 00:39:31.950]  The New World Order doesn't mind, at a certain level, allowing thinking people to know that the globalists carried out September 11th.
[00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:33.891]  Okay?
[00:39:35.692 --> 00:39:42.097]  So, because what they do is, they then demonize America like America did it, and like the U.S.
[00:39:42.137 --> 00:39:42.798]  government did it.
[00:39:43.524 --> 00:39:44.304]  When the U.S.
[00:39:44.344 --> 00:39:47.445]  government, in reality, did not carry out September 11th.
[00:39:47.646 --> 00:39:57.269]  A tiny cabal, in key infrastructure positions, controlling major mechanisms and fail-safe systems, from the evidence, did carry it out.
[00:39:57.449 --> 00:40:09.673]  So, that's like saying if somebody hijacks a bus and uses it to run over people on the street, that it's the bus company's fault, or the bus manufacturer's fault, or the guy that paved the highway's fault.
[00:40:10.734 --> 00:40:11.054]  Okay?
[00:40:12.466 --> 00:40:15.288]  It's like saying this old man in California that killed 10 people.
[00:40:15.328 --> 00:40:21.973]  It's like saying it's the car's fault or the street vendor's fault or the police's fault.
[00:40:22.393 --> 00:40:24.614]  No, it's not the car or the street.
[00:40:24.895 --> 00:40:25.695]  It's not their fault.
[00:40:25.875 --> 00:40:27.436]  It's not America's fault, folks.
[00:40:27.496 --> 00:40:29.378]  America didn't do this, okay?
[00:40:29.958 --> 00:40:31.119]  The globalists did this.
[00:40:32.285 --> 00:40:41.692]  And so, they have internal propaganda that invading all these countries is good, and all of this is wonderful, and we're the good guys.
[00:40:42.092 --> 00:41:00.146]  While externally, it's put in all the mainstream papers, and the evidence is all brought out, and is allowed to be brought out, by press, even owned by the Bilderberg Group, a lot of the big press owners in Europe are members, to show that the globalists did this, but not to say it's the globalists, but to say it's the U.S.
[00:41:00.186 --> 00:41:00.506]  government.
[00:41:01.636 --> 00:41:20.740]  Then, the UN and the IMF and the World Bank and the EU pose as the peaceniks and the good guys, when in reality, those families are the shareholders of the Federal Reserve and of the Fortune 500 in this country, and are using us as the envelope, as the glove, as the camouflage.
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:27.581]  And so if we're not conscious of that, and let the world say that America did this,
[00:41:28.839 --> 00:41:35.163]  And let the world say that even George Bush did this, we're falling into their hands.
[00:41:36.904 --> 00:41:39.105]  Alright, I don't want to get off into any more of this.
[00:41:39.245 --> 00:41:41.246]  It's the same thing with the war.
[00:41:42.647 --> 00:41:55.855]  The private shareholders of our Federal Reserve, of the defense agencies, and infrastructure, and Big Pharma, and the rest of them, they are pushing, they're using terror attacks.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:58.222]  To get us behind the war.
[00:41:58.282 --> 00:42:01.026]  Then the world has shown how the war is a fraud and a lie.
[00:42:01.667 --> 00:42:09.277]  That lie is hung out there and blamed on America and our institutions to discredit our Republic when our Republic had nothing to do with it.
[00:42:10.606 --> 00:42:31.629]  It'd be like if a bank robber was a make-up artist, say one of these Hollywood make-up artists, you know, they can put a rubber face on that looks just like somebody else, so the Globalist put on the face of America, went in, carried out this slaughter, and then allowed it to come out that, yeah, the witnesses saw this guy in a rubber mask doing it.
[00:42:32.904 --> 00:42:38.066]  But they don't know it's a rubber mask, and then they drag America off to prison, and America's blamed for it.
[00:42:38.246 --> 00:42:39.506]  Let's go to Mike in Florida.
[00:42:39.746 --> 00:42:40.487]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:42:40.527 --> 00:42:40.947]  Go ahead.
[00:42:43.047 --> 00:42:43.368]  Yes, sir.
[00:42:43.408 --> 00:42:44.368]  How are you doing?
[00:42:44.668 --> 00:42:45.068]  Pretty good.
[00:42:46.048 --> 00:42:47.489]  I just had two points I wanted to make.
[00:42:47.869 --> 00:42:56.752]  The first point was I wanted to point out how recently with Uday and Kuse, with them being killed, it really shows what a sadist culture we live in, where people are
[00:42:57.338 --> 00:43:03.721]  Celebrating the deaths of these two men, and they totally forget that we've already lost hundreds of our men, and we're losing men every day.
[00:43:04.361 --> 00:43:07.302]  But it's a big, it's a big Super Bowl win.
[00:43:07.902 --> 00:43:12.004]  Yeah, they said in the news Bush was down, but he just had a big victory.
[00:43:12.064 --> 00:43:13.425]  Poll numbers are going back up.
[00:43:14.646 --> 00:43:18.229]  By the way, Mike, I don't even buy that these guys are dead.
[00:43:18.249 --> 00:43:21.832]  Remember, they said three other times they were sure they were dead.
[00:43:21.892 --> 00:43:23.394]  Witnesses know they were in the building.
[00:43:24.134 --> 00:43:25.656]  They found some bodies.
[00:43:25.676 --> 00:43:30.179]  They're going to do some DNA testing, but now they're going to produce photos of them.
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:38.066]  We've all seen Forrest Gump, where Kennedy gives an award, or LBJ gives an award to Forrest Gump.
[00:43:38.889 --> 00:43:42.690]  I mean, folks, we've all seen the picture of Lee Harvey McVeigh.
[00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:49.412]  I mean, Lee Harvey Oswald with the rifle, and the shadows are all going different directions, and it's turned out that is a fake.
[00:43:49.832 --> 00:43:51.253]  But let's just forget about it.
[00:43:51.273 --> 00:43:53.413]  I mean, I don't believe anything that comes out of their mouths.
[00:43:55.174 --> 00:43:58.595]  Exactly, and I'm glad you brought up Lee Harvey Oswald, because that was my second point.
[00:43:58.615 --> 00:43:59.735]  Lee Harvey McVeigh, yeah.
[00:44:01.116 --> 00:44:08.378]  Yeah, that was going to be my second point, was that recently JFK has been on TV a lot, and while I don't necessarily agree with all the topics
[00:44:08.857 --> 00:44:09.317]  Let's go further.
[00:44:09.337 --> 00:44:09.677]  Let's go further.
[00:44:09.697 --> 00:44:13.899]  Just like with the JFK movie that Stone was allowed to make and put out there and promoted
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:32.644]  It's evil right-wingers, cowboys that did it, when that's a total fraud.
[00:44:33.485 --> 00:44:39.610]  Yeah, they were involved in the mafia planning and as a sub-directorate, but those orders came directly out of Europe.
[00:44:40.991 --> 00:44:42.472]  Yeah, I noticed that when I was watching that last night.
[00:44:42.512 --> 00:44:52.019]  Everybody, it seems they had a lot, everybody had a cowboy hat on, and you could, and every one of those guys that I saw with a cowboy hat on was either involved in... And I guess the guys in the cowboy hats control the Pentagon and the New York Times.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.021]  And the Warren Commission, too.
[00:44:54.921 --> 00:44:55.381]  Exactly.
[00:44:55.462 --> 00:44:57.343]  Every scene they were in, you could see them.
[00:44:57.383 --> 00:45:12.055]  So see, they know that we know what they're doing, so they go, okay, it's like a mafia boss doesn't mind if one of his muscle men goes to jail as a capo when he really wasn't a capo, and when the guy gets out in 20 years, he gets rewarded.
[00:45:13.296 --> 00:45:17.559]  But they just, in hindsight, blame some subdivision.
[00:45:21.226 --> 00:45:23.648]  Perhaps George Bush's father had anything to do with anything?
[00:45:24.008 --> 00:45:27.650]  He was on the ground in Dealey, according to hundreds of major reports.
[00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:28.411]  It's a fact.
[00:45:29.491 --> 00:45:34.474]  And my second question is, just out of curiosity, I'm sure you know a lot more about this than I do.
[00:45:34.554 --> 00:45:40.138]  As far as Jack Ruby goes, what, like, what was his, I know he died back in the 60s, but what was his cause of death?
[00:45:40.158 --> 00:45:41.459]  Like, what was it?
[00:45:41.539 --> 00:45:42.499]  I mean... Cancer.
[00:45:42.519 --> 00:45:43.720]  It was cancer?
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:46.622]  Accelerated, massive cancer.
[00:45:47.603 --> 00:45:49.624]  And he never at any point revealed his story, or...
[00:45:51.059 --> 00:45:51.279]  No.
[00:45:53.221 --> 00:46:00.688]  And a lot of folks, some of the medical records show he'd been diagnosed with cancer beforehand, and the mob does this a lot.
[00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:09.557]  One of their guys that's got cancer, this has happened a lot, or is real sick, will do a big public hit, and then their family's well taken care of.
[00:46:14.153 --> 00:46:21.276]  Now understand, again, the Mafia, and this is admitted, organized crime has the infrastructure, has local officials paid off, knows the ground.
[00:46:21.576 --> 00:46:25.257]  They will have an intermediate sub-directorate pay off Mafia to carry out hits.
[00:46:25.277 --> 00:46:25.617]  Go ahead.
[00:46:26.457 --> 00:46:27.138]  One more thing, Alex.
[00:46:27.218 --> 00:46:30.619]  I hope you never ever play the interview with Ann Coulter again.
[00:46:30.639 --> 00:46:32.300]  Not because I dislike the interview.
[00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:33.920]  I think it's a great, compelling interview.
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.241]  Because I really can't stand to listen to it again.
[00:46:37.341 --> 00:46:40.022]  It makes me that sick to have to hear that.
[00:46:40.042 --> 00:46:41.763]  To have to hear her spew that stuff.
[00:46:43.678 --> 00:46:46.239]  Her neocontrash, you know.
[00:46:46.259 --> 00:46:47.579]  Yeah, I can't hear that again.
[00:46:47.879 --> 00:46:48.519]  All right, thank you.
[00:46:48.559 --> 00:46:49.059]  Thank you, Mike.
[00:46:49.099 --> 00:46:50.039]  I really appreciate the call.
[00:46:50.059 --> 00:46:51.360]  Let's talk to Roger now.
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.120]  Roger in Pennsylvania.
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:53.820]  Go ahead, Roger.
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:54.220]  Welcome.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.200]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:08.003]  I want to pound out these two bill numbers that Tom Tang Credo is opposing today that might be voted on in as little as 20 minutes, or I saw here by 1 o'clock, which I assume means Eastern, but it might not take for hours.
[00:47:08.723 --> 00:47:12.084]  So if you all grab your pencils, maybe you could repeat the numbers in just a couple minutes.
[00:47:12.873 --> 00:47:20.976]  And by the way, the administration says they're going to serve up photographs of Uday and Usay as proof to the Iraqis.
[00:47:21.276 --> 00:47:22.356]  And that's what I just said.
[00:47:22.536 --> 00:47:26.917]  Yeah, no independent forensics or any such trivial matters as that.
[00:47:27.077 --> 00:47:29.098]  But hey, hey, they're getting them ready.
[00:47:29.218 --> 00:47:30.859]  It'll take a few days.
[00:47:31.239 --> 00:47:32.399]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:47:32.799 --> 00:47:33.199]  Anyway, okay.
[00:47:33.239 --> 00:47:34.800]  And they better do a good job.
[00:47:35.575 --> 00:47:40.996]  I bet they're going to be blurred, that way you can't go in with a computer and show the editing.
[00:47:41.136 --> 00:47:42.677]  Which we've done with past photos.
[00:47:42.717 --> 00:47:43.057]  Go ahead.
[00:47:43.217 --> 00:47:46.118]  Even if they're crystal clear, that doesn't mean they weren't cooked.
[00:47:47.038 --> 00:47:47.458]  Yeah, okay.
[00:47:47.778 --> 00:47:50.719]  Now these two... Hey, wait a minute.
[00:47:50.939 --> 00:47:52.619]  I'll hold you over, Roger, and let you finish.
[00:47:52.639 --> 00:47:55.040]  Do you know Mad Dog Ben Richards?
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.660]  The brittle slayer of 50 men, women, and children?
[00:47:58.121 --> 00:47:58.841]  I mean, he did it.
[00:47:58.941 --> 00:48:00.641]  He's going to be on The Running Man tonight.
[00:48:01.721 --> 00:48:03.782]  Ready to pay his debt to society in full.
[00:48:05.084 --> 00:48:06.025]  We don't lie.
[00:48:06.045 --> 00:48:10.748]  The Running Man, brought to you by ICS and Cadre Cola.
[00:48:11.149 --> 00:48:13.230]  Yeah, now these two bills are free trade agreements.
[00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:16.313]  Hey, remember kids, July is bonus recruitment month.
[00:48:16.553 --> 00:48:18.694]  Report a family member and receive a double bonus.
[00:48:19.014 --> 00:48:28.922]  Tell you what, stay there, Roger, and we'll let you finish up right here on The Running Man, the number one television show in the whole wide world!
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:35.223]  Federal Reserve, no more federal than Federal Express, and they have no reserves.
[00:48:35.443 --> 00:48:38.305]  Our once mighty Green Bank is losing more value every day.
[00:48:38.425 --> 00:48:41.667]  Your fortune is dwindling and your children's future looks even worse.
[00:48:41.807 --> 00:48:44.308]  It's all a result of the power-hungry Federal Reserve.
[00:48:44.348 --> 00:48:46.910]  The less wealth you have, the more control they have over you.
[00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:48.251]  But what can you do about it?
[00:48:48.351 --> 00:48:51.174]  We're all reliant on their funny money for our daily transactions.
[00:48:51.374 --> 00:48:52.055]  Well, not anymore.
[00:48:52.155 --> 00:48:56.659]  The Liberty Dollar is a silver-backed currency that competes directly with the Fed's fiat currency.
[00:48:56.799 --> 00:48:59.142]  It's inflation-proof and its value is inherent.
[00:48:59.242 --> 00:49:04.627]  Get it at wishgranted.com or call toll-free 1-800-850-8998.
[00:49:04.727 --> 00:49:07.169]  Now you can escape the greed and control of the Federal Reserve.
[00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:12.915]  Thousands of patriots already have and that means more honorable businesses are accepting the Liberty Dollar every day.
[00:49:13.095 --> 00:49:16.618]  Go to wishgranted.com or call 800-850-8998.
[00:49:16.858 --> 00:49:21.881]  That's 800-850-8998 to get your Liberty Dollars today.
[00:49:22.001 --> 00:49:27.785]  With your help, decent Americans can wipe out the Fed and return to currency with real value, just like the Constitution intended.
[00:49:27.845 --> 00:49:31.248]  Go to wishgranted.com today and free yourself with the Liberty Dollar.
[00:49:31.448 --> 00:49:33.409]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:49:33.489 --> 00:49:44.211]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:49:44.572 --> 00:49:49.113]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:49:49.173 --> 00:50:00.496]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[00:50:01.096 --> 00:50:07.942]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:50:08.342 --> 00:50:10.484]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:50:10.965 --> 00:50:15.929]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:50:16.229 --> 00:50:22.993]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:50:23.193 --> 00:50:26.796]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:50:27.036 --> 00:50:30.658]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:50:31.559 --> 00:50:35.901]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:50:36.081 --> 00:50:40.544]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:50:40.644 --> 00:50:41.885]  There is a chance
[00:50:42.405 --> 00:50:45.026]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:50:45.067 --> 00:50:47.588]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:50:48.188 --> 00:50:52.410]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:59.394]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:50:59.534 --> 00:51:01.535]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:01.935 --> 00:51:12.324]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:12.544 --> 00:51:17.928]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:51:18.409 --> 00:51:21.631]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:21.671 --> 00:51:22.192]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:22.212 --> 00:51:23.473]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:51:32.632 --> 00:51:37.779]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:51:38.460 --> 00:51:40.823]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:45.509]  Wide open phones on this Thursday edition of the worldwide broadcast 800-259-9231.
[00:51:49.256 --> 00:51:53.339]  Roger, tell us about these bills and bill numbers that you think are important.
[00:51:53.639 --> 00:52:02.466]  Okay, these two bill numbers, they're dealing with free trade agreements with immigration provisions and two freshly tested poll-free numbers.
[00:52:03.246 --> 00:52:07.369]  So we've got to oppose Joint 10 Credo in opposing both of these bills.
[00:52:07.389 --> 00:52:07.709]  They're H.R.
[00:52:07.729 --> 00:52:08.010]  2738 and 2739.
[00:52:14.193 --> 00:52:16.676]  And Capitol Hill switchboard, two numbers, 800-648-3516 and 877-762-8762.
[00:52:16.716 --> 00:52:17.978]  Just repeat the numbers quickly, HR 2738 and 2739.
[00:52:34.824 --> 00:52:38.186]  On 800-648-3516 or 877-762-8762.
[00:52:38.206 --> 00:52:46.810]  It's vital you call today and soon because it loads very quick and God bless.
[00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.330]  All right.
[00:52:47.350 --> 00:52:47.931]  Thank you, Roger.
[00:52:47.951 --> 00:52:48.591]  Appreciate that.
[00:52:48.611 --> 00:52:49.632]  Yeah, I've seen those bills.
[00:52:49.652 --> 00:52:50.352]  They're very dangerous.
[00:52:51.724 --> 00:52:58.649]  And Bush has said that his job is to get Tancredo out of office because Tancredo is a real conservative, like Ron Paul, and the neocons can't have that.
[00:52:58.689 --> 00:53:01.171]  We've had Tom Tancredo on, on the record to tell you that.
[00:53:01.211 --> 00:53:08.556]  So, for those in Colorado that are blessed enough to have Tancredo, just remember, if the neocon wants to get him out of office, better support him.
[00:53:09.397 --> 00:53:15.281]  And also, a federal judge just threw out the lawsuit by the NAACP trying to shut down gun makers.
[00:53:15.921 --> 00:53:16.902]  Oh, that is good news.
[00:53:17.897 --> 00:53:27.542]  The House just voted down the grabbing of the final independent TV and radio stations by the Four Horsemen, the big four networks.
[00:53:27.622 --> 00:53:28.663]  That's great news.
[00:53:29.303 --> 00:53:31.784]  Part of the Patriot Act just got machine gunned down.
[00:53:33.065 --> 00:53:38.468]  But just a small portion of it got strafed by good members of the House.
[00:53:39.048 --> 00:53:41.509]  There's a bunch of other provisions that we need to get removed.
[00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:44.911]  And so a lot of stuff's happening.
[00:53:45.936 --> 00:53:55.800]  A lot of stuff is happening, and again, some good members of Congress are in the Info War firing the big guns and taking out some of the bad legislation.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:54:01.722]  But the enemy is throwing even more of it at us to try to overwhelm us.
[00:54:01.802 --> 00:54:12.186]  But we're in the war, and again, I'm using the analogy of people standing up to this being firing salvos at the enemy, because that's exactly what it is in an Info War sense.
[00:54:13.522 --> 00:54:16.546]  I'm going to come back and we'll get to... I haven't even gotten in the news yet, folks.
[00:54:16.586 --> 00:54:17.607]  There's just so much of it.
[00:54:18.107 --> 00:54:21.552]  And we'll get to Tom and Mike and many others that are holding patiently.
[00:54:23.033 --> 00:54:32.064]  If you believe in this broadcast and what we're doing and the fight against the globalists, please go to InfoWars.net and link through to our secure online shopping cart.

[00:54:51.756 --> 00:54:56.600]  Get the videos, make copies for non-profit, not for sale purposes, folks.
[00:54:57.261 --> 00:55:00.203]  Get them, make copies, get the videos out to your friends,
[00:55:00.931 --> 00:55:08.896]  Your families, your county commissioners, your sheriffs and others, so they too can know who the real terrorists are and understand the real reality.
[00:55:09.537 --> 00:55:16.782]  So go to Infowars.net to link through to our secure online shopping cart to order the videos and the books.

[00:55:24.182 --> 00:55:24.402]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:55:38.291 --> 00:55:49.300]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:55:50.782 --> 00:55:52.823]  Expose the fraud of the New World Order.
[00:55:54.144 --> 00:56:01.811]  Before I get a bunch of calls asking what I was doing at the end of the last segment talking about The Running Man, that was a 1986 Arnold Schwarzenegger movie about a high-tech police state.
[00:56:02.645 --> 00:56:06.668]  Where they have fake newscasts and the rest of it, kind of like Wag the Dog, another movie.
[00:56:07.208 --> 00:56:14.193]  I suggest you see both of them, because we're living in the real world, seeing these exact type of things manifest themselves.
[00:56:14.914 --> 00:56:18.396]  Alright, we're just 70 seconds away from the second hour.
[00:56:18.476 --> 00:56:19.577]  Please stay with us.
[00:56:21.558 --> 00:56:23.300]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:56:23.540 --> 00:56:29.284]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:56:29.524 --> 00:56:32.086]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible.
[00:56:35.948 --> 00:56:39.169]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:46.690 --> 00:56:47.350]  Big Brother.
[00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:49.090]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:49.771 --> 00:56:50.931]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:50.951 --> 00:56:52.391]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.111 --> 00:56:54.071]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:54.671 --> 00:56:58.572]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:58.852 --> 00:57:02.933]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.303 --> 00:57:10.607]  Already 25 seconds into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[00:57:10.807 --> 00:57:13.829]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:57:13.869 --> 00:57:16.851]  The website is InfoWars.net.
[00:57:18.652 --> 00:57:21.634]  Calm and prison planet are down, but they'll be back up.
[00:57:21.654 --> 00:57:22.975]  That's a rarity, but it's happened.
[00:57:23.415 --> 00:57:24.196]  Trying to get it back up.
[00:57:24.536 --> 00:57:28.339]  Just a victim, I guess, for own success or some backbone problems with the net itself.
[00:57:29.319 --> 00:57:33.122]  But InfoWars.net is up and been updated with a lot of vital information.
[00:57:34.476 --> 00:57:36.844]  Also, a bunch of your calls coming up in this hour.
[00:57:36.864 --> 00:57:38.510]  A toll-free number to join us on air.
[00:57:39.657 --> 00:57:39.737]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:57:40.017 --> 00:57:42.019]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:57:42.039 --> 00:57:49.844]  We're about to go to your calls.
[00:57:50.425 --> 00:57:52.086]  I'd like to hear some callers talk about this.
[00:57:52.126 --> 00:57:54.288]  I made a big deal out of it in the first hours.
[00:57:54.328 --> 00:57:55.048]  It is a big deal.
[00:57:55.548 --> 00:57:57.610]  Poll shows many Germans see U.S.
[00:57:57.650 --> 00:58:00.392]  behind September 11th, and that's from Reuters.
[00:58:00.912 --> 00:58:03.254]  It's not from Infowars.net, though it's posted there.
[00:58:03.674 --> 00:58:05.515]  That's from Reuters.
[00:58:06.576 --> 00:58:07.357]  Major poll.
[00:58:09.244 --> 00:58:11.826]  A large push, and think the globalists carried it out.
[00:58:11.886 --> 00:58:12.506]  Well, that's true.
[00:58:12.927 --> 00:58:14.127]  They're wrong to say U.S.
[00:58:14.167 --> 00:58:14.648]  behind.
[00:58:14.688 --> 00:58:15.969]  The globalists are behind.
[00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:21.432]  FAA, okay, sought for drones for law enforcement purposes.
[00:58:21.552 --> 00:58:23.333]  Mm-hmm, the drones, all part of freedom.
[00:58:24.854 --> 00:58:27.216]  And the FBI chief praises the Patriot Act.
[00:58:27.236 --> 00:58:28.397]  Well, I'm glad someone is.
[00:58:29.364 --> 00:58:35.229]  Applied Digital gets big orders from Russia and China and Mexico to implant their populations with trackable chips.
[00:58:35.269 --> 00:58:41.554]  This is from Business Journal, the South Florida Business Journal, how wonderful your implanted government track chip is.
[00:58:41.894 --> 00:58:43.355]  Again, another great sign of freedom.
[00:58:44.936 --> 00:58:49.099]  We've got their official press release here for you as well.
[00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:54.172]  Tracking chips eyed by retailers despite privacy concerns.
[00:58:54.232 --> 00:58:59.515]  Tracker chips and we have the documents now public with Homeland Security as a plan to track and control and tax you.
[00:58:59.935 --> 00:59:01.996]  Again, tiny microchips woven into your clothes.
[00:59:02.036 --> 00:59:03.737]  It's all part of freedom.
[00:59:03.757 --> 00:59:05.859]  This is from the Associated Press and other publications.
[00:59:06.699 --> 00:59:13.023]  Again, small tracker chips just like drones and just like fake TV newscasts and microphones in your cable boxes.
[00:59:13.123 --> 00:59:15.424]  It's all part of freedom.
[00:59:15.504 --> 00:59:16.464]  Child tracking device.
[00:59:16.484 --> 00:59:18.105]  Use GPS to determine location.
[00:59:18.125 --> 00:59:19.086]  More on loving chips.
[00:59:20.413 --> 00:59:23.034]  Projects range from robots to electronic surveillance.
[00:59:23.054 --> 00:59:26.354]  A big story out of Salt Lake Tribune about the hover drones looking through your walls.
[00:59:26.414 --> 00:59:28.015]  We'll get into that as well.
[00:59:28.035 --> 00:59:29.255]  An old part of Freedom.
[00:59:30.575 --> 00:59:33.616]  Rumsfeld says you have to release photos of Saddam's sons.
[00:59:34.316 --> 00:59:36.217]  Maybe he'll put their heads on Godzilla.
[00:59:36.237 --> 00:59:37.857]  That would be more real and more believable.
[00:59:39.017 --> 00:59:40.437]  But again, we can totally trust them.
[00:59:40.458 --> 00:59:41.098]  They're good people.
[00:59:41.318 --> 00:59:42.458]  They wouldn't lie to us, would they?
[00:59:43.278 --> 00:59:44.858]  And maybe they're going to get Saddam any day.
[00:59:44.898 --> 00:59:46.999]  Yeah, I predict that they'll grab one of his doubles and
[00:59:47.907 --> 00:59:51.389]  Placed him on a petard and hang him and have everybody spit on him.
[00:59:51.409 --> 00:59:52.010]  That'd be nice.
[00:59:52.510 --> 00:59:52.910]  Everybody.
[00:59:53.130 --> 00:59:55.572]  When he was working for the Globalist and already out of the country.
[00:59:56.192 --> 00:59:58.193]  So the world awaits the pictures of the bodies.
[00:59:59.534 --> 01:00:02.176]  And North Korea may go nuclear, says Tokyo.
[01:00:02.196 --> 01:00:05.178]  So Tokyo's going to go ahead and deploy its own nukes.
[01:00:05.818 --> 01:00:07.459]  Ice global arms escalation.
[01:00:07.479 --> 01:00:14.063]  Attorney General says church abuse scandal likely involve more than 1,000 victims.
[01:00:14.083 --> 01:00:16.965]  They say it borders on the unbelievable, despite the fact it's documented.
[01:00:18.552 --> 01:00:22.654]  1,000 children abused by degenerate Catholic priests is horrible.
[01:00:23.094 --> 01:00:26.255]  It is dwarfed by one bust of Dime Corps in the U.N.
[01:00:26.275 --> 01:00:28.356]  with 200,000 women and children last year.
[01:00:28.656 --> 01:00:30.137]  You notice, though, that's not in the press.
[01:00:32.257 --> 01:00:33.558]  Oh, that's from the Boston Globe.
[01:00:33.578 --> 01:00:34.518]  We'll get to that later.
[01:00:34.858 --> 01:00:36.519]  Also genetically modified.
[01:00:36.819 --> 01:00:40.000]  Scientists know too little about what it'll do to wildlife.
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:42.441]  Governor Gray Davis will face recall vote.
[01:00:42.541 --> 01:00:44.302]  Wonderful news against that gun grabber.
[01:00:44.898 --> 01:00:50.901]  We'll probably get Arnold Schwarzenegger, the son of a Gestapo officer, who says gun control and abortion is good, as your new governor.
[01:00:52.281 --> 01:00:57.103]  We will also get to a 100-day countdown to China's first astronaut.
[01:00:57.963 --> 01:01:00.925]  Editorial, the death of David Kelly, some new developments on that.
[01:01:00.965 --> 01:01:03.986]  Turns out the BBC's got tapes of him proving what they said was true.
[01:01:05.326 --> 01:01:06.406]  That's all coming up.
[01:01:06.426 --> 01:01:10.167]  They're also trying to ban toy guns all over the country and being very successful.
[01:01:10.587 --> 01:01:11.968]  As well as banning paint guns.
[01:01:12.648 --> 01:01:14.108]  Prelude to banning the real thing.
[01:01:14.128 --> 01:01:17.649]  A lot of conservatives pushing to ban the toy guns because they're so conservative.
[01:01:18.129 --> 01:01:18.949]  Neocons.
[01:01:19.449 --> 01:01:20.270]  We're liberals here.
[01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:22.670]  We're for the Second Amendment and controlled borders.
[01:01:23.711 --> 01:01:26.051]  But first your calls and we get back at 800-259-9231.
[01:01:26.071 --> 01:01:27.211]  And again, we're bad folks.
[01:01:27.331 --> 01:01:30.832]  We're against hover drones looking through your walls.
[01:01:34.827 --> 01:01:37.428]  And we're against supercomputers to communist China.
[01:01:37.468 --> 01:01:38.369]  That means we're liberals.
[01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:39.510]  We'll be right back.
[01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:40.010]  Stay with us.
[01:01:42.171 --> 01:01:45.513]  If you're like most Americans, you've heard how low interest rates are these days.
[01:01:45.593 --> 01:01:47.694]  So why are you still struggling to pay off debt?
[01:01:48.014 --> 01:01:50.535]  Rates on debt consolidation loans are at all-time lows.
[01:01:50.675 --> 01:01:55.718]  So the time to consolidate your individual credit card balances, car loans, and other debt has never been better.
[01:01:55.858 --> 01:01:57.679]  And no one makes it easier than the credit people.

[01:02:04.023 --> 01:02:05.624]  Fixed rates start as low as 5.25%.
[01:02:06.785 --> 01:02:07.245]  Low credit?
[01:02:07.385 --> 01:02:07.926]  Bad credit?

[01:02:27.759 --> 01:02:31.580]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:02:49.346 --> 01:02:50.086]  That's right, folks.
[01:02:50.146 --> 01:02:50.727]  DVD.
[01:02:50.907 --> 01:02:53.128]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:02:53.268 --> 01:02:55.369]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:02:55.649 --> 01:03:00.592]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:03:00.912 --> 01:03:04.954]  The Road of Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:03:05.194 --> 01:03:06.975]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:03:07.055 --> 01:03:17.700]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.741]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:03:19.961 --> 01:03:22.002]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today.

[01:03:41.354 --> 01:03:43.315]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:03:43.415 --> 01:03:54.121]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:03:54.502 --> 01:03:59.024]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:03:59.084 --> 01:04:10.411]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[01:04:11.011 --> 01:04:17.858]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:04:18.258 --> 01:04:20.400]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:25.865]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[01:04:26.165 --> 01:04:32.331]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[01:04:33.592 --> 01:04:36.233]  Alright, let's go straight back into your calls today.
[01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:37.534]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:04:55.379 --> 01:04:57.900]  We're going to talk to Tom, Mike, Ted, Buck, and others.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.800]  And, uh, Tom in California, you're on the air.
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:01.381]  Welcome, sir.
[01:05:01.801 --> 01:05:02.421]  Morning, Alex.
[01:05:02.721 --> 01:05:04.381]  Um, I was lucky, I have two points to make.
[01:05:04.441 --> 01:05:06.482]  I was lucky enough to be on C-SPAN this morning.
[01:05:06.522 --> 01:05:12.683]  The topic was the report that came out about 9-11 involving the FBI and the CIA and the NSA, I guess.
[01:05:13.323 --> 01:05:19.325]  And most of the callers were calling about, you know, the FBI making comments and they kept concentrating on, uh,
[01:05:20.279 --> 01:05:26.980]  News articles about the Saudis, and they're playing that band, the Saudis, the Saudis, and their involvement.
[01:05:27.161 --> 01:05:35.142]  And when they got to my call, I brought up about the blocking of the FBI agents going after Al-Qaeda right after 9-11.
[01:05:35.202 --> 01:05:38.023]  Yeah, W1999 by Bush.
[01:05:38.223 --> 01:05:42.784]  Yeah, and then I went straight to, and I brought this up, and I said, and I'd like to mention the Carlyle Group.
[01:05:43.143 --> 01:05:50.705]  And that Bin Laden family, and the Bush family, the two major investors in it, and I said, people in this country need to wake up and see the terrorists in their own government.
[01:05:50.885 --> 01:05:56.226]  And the look on the host's face when I, when that, because it goes like, simultaneously when you're calling C-SPAN.
[01:05:56.266 --> 01:05:58.606]  It just, the look on his face when that went through.
[01:05:58.966 --> 01:06:01.027]  Did you get an InfoWars plug-in?
[01:06:01.987 --> 01:06:03.047]  I'm sorry, I didn't.
[01:06:03.087 --> 01:06:03.547]  I should have.
[01:06:03.587 --> 01:06:10.809]  I didn't think about that, because I wanted to get through without them cutting me off, and I basically said that, and I said, thank you, and click, and hung up on them, so I know it went through.
[01:06:10.829 --> 01:06:12.309]  And my second point was,
[01:06:13.498 --> 01:06:16.479]  I know you've heard about the recall that's going on and it's gone through.
[01:06:16.499 --> 01:06:21.962]  The local stations out here are saying that Arnie is not going to be running.
[01:06:22.522 --> 01:06:23.462]  Well, that's a blessing.
[01:06:23.502 --> 01:06:31.925]  There's one real conservative candidate, and we're going to get him on, but Arnold, I mean, the guy's anti-gun, pro-abortion, the son of a Gestapo operator.
[01:06:31.945 --> 01:06:35.887]  Yeah, the one thing that would bother me that I just found out about the county I live in,
[01:06:36.411 --> 01:06:40.512]  Well, just now, yesterday, is that we're going to start doing electronic voting out here.
[01:06:40.893 --> 01:06:48.175]  Well, the touch screens that are remote controlled and meted, and the government's involved, and there's no record of how you voted, but that's okay.
[01:06:48.235 --> 01:07:00.159]  Yeah, and it's like, that's my next issue that I'm going to have to be fighting against my county, because, I mean, it's totally corrupted, and they can manipulate the whole vote, and I'm, like, totally against it, and I'm really angry.
[01:07:00.179 --> 01:07:02.400]  Well, did you hear our guest on Monday?
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.460]  I mean, that was powerful.
[01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:15.242]  Yes, I miss that show, but I've known of a woman who, on a different radio show a year ago, that she was running in New Orleans for some small office.
[01:07:15.542 --> 01:07:27.831]  They went into the polling place for the area where they had the election for her, and they still had the machines running, and she had a camera crew with her and a journalist.
[01:07:27.991 --> 01:07:31.854]  When they went to go vote for her, the vote went to her opponent.
[01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:34.311]  Right there.
[01:07:34.351 --> 01:07:39.275]  These machines are corrupted.
[01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:52.864]  You've got Chuck Hagel, the Nebraska Republican, who won this big landslide upset, despite what the polls said, and it turns out he owns the big companies selling most of these, and they admit they're wirelessly accessed.
[01:07:53.264 --> 01:07:54.205]  It goes on and on.
[01:07:55.786 --> 01:07:58.348]  We have to fight when these things come up.
[01:07:58.368 --> 01:07:59.829]  I want to stick to paper ballots.
[01:08:01.734 --> 01:08:14.826]  Hey, the League of Women Voters is arguing against a bill by a Republican, a good Republican, Rush Holt, is fighting to not have a paper receipt and to allow them to be wirelessly accessed.
[01:08:15.006 --> 01:08:16.148]  I mean, come on folks!
[01:08:16.188 --> 01:08:19.030]  Yeah, I don't want to do it over the internet either as well.
[01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:21.092]  It's ludicrous.
[01:08:21.252 --> 01:08:22.974]  We might as well not stop voting right now.
[01:08:23.659 --> 01:08:24.579]  Now, wait a minute.
[01:08:24.619 --> 01:08:29.541]  You're going to believe these photos of Uzay and Quizay when they come out.
[01:08:29.601 --> 01:08:37.204]  They wouldn't create... I mean, they said three other times they were sure they'd killed him, and then they give us victories over and over again with the same people.
[01:08:37.284 --> 01:08:39.445]  It's like Goldstein in 1984.
[01:08:39.525 --> 01:08:42.105]  He's the boogeyman, and they're going to keep recycling them.
[01:08:42.145 --> 01:08:43.306]  It's a big victory.
[01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:46.147]  Well, I think it's starting to fall on deaf ears.
[01:08:46.507 --> 01:08:46.987]  It really is.
[01:08:47.567 --> 01:08:48.368]  Thanks for the call.
[01:08:49.841 --> 01:08:51.062]  I really do appreciate it, Tom.
[01:08:51.282 --> 01:08:52.982]  Let's talk to Mike in Minnesota.
[01:08:53.002 --> 01:08:53.823]  Mike, good to hear from you.
[01:08:53.843 --> 01:08:54.263]  Go ahead.
[01:08:54.283 --> 01:08:55.904]  Hello?
[01:08:56.164 --> 01:08:56.584]  Yes, sir.
[01:08:56.604 --> 01:08:58.004]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[01:08:58.024 --> 01:08:58.925]  You're doing a great job.
[01:09:00.365 --> 01:09:00.986]  You're a machine.
[01:09:01.006 --> 01:09:01.846]  You're a machine.
[01:09:02.847 --> 01:09:03.267]  It's great.
[01:09:03.747 --> 01:09:05.087]  Hey, just a couple of things.
[01:09:06.048 --> 01:09:13.811]  Today in Minnesota on the news a little while ago in the Central Time Zone, the Ranking General of the Minnesota National Guard resigned.
[01:09:15.012 --> 01:09:18.253]  And they said it was because of a couple of federal complaints.
[01:09:19.122 --> 01:09:22.963]  I don't have the details on it, but it seems a little fishy.
[01:09:23.463 --> 01:09:46.230]  Well, I know that Minnesota passed a law, according to the Pioneer Press newspaper two years ago, that if there's any foot and mouth outbreaks, they're going to lock all farm families, ranch families, down on their farms and quote, bring them food and slaughter all their animals, and mad cow foot and mouth anything, and it turns out, of course, Porton Down released that on purpose
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.823]  That's Sky Television News and the Sunday Herald a few years ago.
[01:09:50.983 --> 01:09:56.608]  And of course, who was the head of Porton Down in the early 90s but Dr. David Kelly.
[01:09:56.908 --> 01:09:59.030]  Oh yeah, the suicide commando there.
[01:09:59.090 --> 01:09:59.610]  Sure he was.
[01:09:59.730 --> 01:10:00.691]  And now it's official.
[01:10:01.132 --> 01:10:02.893]  The police said it was a grizzly find.
[01:10:02.933 --> 01:10:07.857]  He said that he was going to go public and get his good name back against the Ministry of Defense and that he was going to fight it.
[01:10:07.897 --> 01:10:10.199]  And then a few hours later he was dead.
[01:10:10.259 --> 01:10:13.301]  But we have his emails, his phone calls, what his family said.
[01:10:13.341 --> 01:10:15.003]  But again, it's official.
[01:10:15.063 --> 01:10:15.463]  It's a suicide.
[01:10:16.764 --> 01:10:17.104]  Yeah.
[01:10:17.705 --> 01:10:23.610]  And what is it, about three or four days ago they just sent 1,100 Minnesota National Guard troops to Bosnia.
[01:10:24.170 --> 01:10:26.692]  Not to Iraq or Afghanistan, but to Bosnia.
[01:10:28.394 --> 01:10:31.537]  And, you know, it's kind of shocking the way they're weakening all the states.
[01:10:32.057 --> 01:10:33.858]  I mean, well, it's a plan, obviously.
[01:10:33.939 --> 01:10:39.223]  While they sign deals with Mexico and Canada to bring in, quote, security forces.
[01:10:39.243 --> 01:10:40.284]  Yeah, foreign troops.
[01:10:41.036 --> 01:10:42.196]  Official, thanks for the call.
[01:10:42.496 --> 01:10:42.856]  Okay.
[01:10:43.056 --> 01:10:43.857]  Good to hear from you.
[01:10:43.957 --> 01:10:45.597]  Ted in New York, and then Buck.
[01:10:45.617 --> 01:10:46.457]  Ted, you're on the air.
[01:10:46.517 --> 01:10:46.957]  Go ahead.
[01:10:47.517 --> 01:10:48.098]  Hello, Alex.
[01:10:49.878 --> 01:10:54.759]  I've been agonizing over telling you this one, but this is a true police state story.
[01:10:55.979 --> 01:11:04.421]  Last Saturday, a relative of mine was behind, walking behind a Denny's in Joplin, Missouri.
[01:11:05.441 --> 01:11:08.262]  He witnessed another man being beaten on the ground.
[01:11:10.712 --> 01:11:12.093]  By like three or four cops.
[01:11:13.354 --> 01:11:16.616]  He cried out, you know, and says, you know, stop this.
[01:11:17.536 --> 01:11:20.858]  Now, my relative has MS, he weighs 108 pounds.
[01:11:21.799 --> 01:11:23.059]  He's an Al-Qaeda member.
[01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:23.940]  Yeah.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:27.262]  And he uses a cane and he's very frail and he can hardly walk.
[01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:28.743]  That is a sign of Al-Qaeda.
[01:11:29.563 --> 01:11:39.169]  Yes, and what his reward for this was to be beaten and tossed into the bushes, dragged off and thrown in the jail, charged with obstruction.
[01:11:40.556 --> 01:11:52.185]  Now, to make matters worse, because he has some advanced MS, he then went into a seizure in the jail.
[01:11:52.325 --> 01:11:55.748]  Which is a Code Al-Qaeda transmission.
[01:11:55.768 --> 01:12:00.112]  Yeah.
[01:12:00.132 --> 01:12:02.294]  And they never called the paramedics to help the man.
[01:12:03.915 --> 01:12:05.516]  Well, that's what the homeland's all about.
[01:12:07.965 --> 01:12:12.827]  Maybe ten years in a forced labor camp they're building, according to all the major papers, is good.
[01:12:13.908 --> 01:12:30.935]  Yeah, and as a result, he ended up in a hospital after his friend posted bail for him, and he had to have an airway put in, he couldn't breathe, the oxygen wasn't working, and they had him out for about three days before he started to recover.
[01:12:32.021 --> 01:12:38.448]  All right, sarcasm aside, God bless your friend for standing up for somebody being brutally beaten, and I'm really sad that happened.
[01:12:38.468 --> 01:12:40.470]  We should pray for him, for your family member.
[01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:46.936]  But New York, I mean, it's admitted that they just savagely beat or shoot anybody.
[01:12:47.817 --> 01:12:50.379]  And to shoot innocent people on the back, nothing happens.
[01:12:50.619 --> 01:12:56.225]  And they've been ordered to arrest and beat people who sit on the sidewalk in front of their own business.
[01:12:56.869 --> 01:12:57.369]  Yeah, they're so nice.
[01:12:57.389 --> 01:12:57.890]  You know, the uh...
[01:13:19.901 --> 01:13:22.182]  So that disabled people can be beaten.
[01:13:22.202 --> 01:13:26.283]  They fought so drones can look through our walls with ground-penetrating radar.
[01:13:26.703 --> 01:13:30.584]  Our veterans fought so RFID chips could be on all the products you buy.
[01:13:30.944 --> 01:13:34.625]  Our veterans fought so we could be satellite-taxed and tracked driving our cars.
[01:13:35.005 --> 01:13:37.965]  That's what George Washington fought for.
[01:13:38.026 --> 01:13:47.388]  And when you criticize total government power, as the neocons, as Ron Paul has exposed, when you fight against total monopoly of power, you are aiding Al Qaeda.
[01:13:48.516 --> 01:13:50.838]  Well, when his friend told me this, he was quite scared.
[01:13:50.858 --> 01:13:51.699]  I said, what are you scared of?
[01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:55.062]  He said, the cops and Joplin are like Nazis, he said.
[01:13:55.563 --> 01:13:57.565]  I said, but you know, I said, just remember this.
[01:13:58.326 --> 01:14:03.691]  I said, it could have been you or me or anyone else that was being beaten up by cops behind Denny's.
[01:14:04.251 --> 01:14:06.534]  And I said, wouldn't you want someone else to step in?
[01:14:06.554 --> 01:14:10.878]  Who else is going to step in if the citizens don't keep an eye on this out of control
[01:14:11.967 --> 01:14:15.770]  Well, this is the new thing, and they feel so sorry for themselves, the police do.
[01:14:15.810 --> 01:14:19.433]  Not all of them, but in certain areas you get real big little hovies of them.
[01:14:21.074 --> 01:14:24.677]  You know, with the local mob boss who's got his harem of thugs, basically.
[01:14:25.357 --> 01:14:27.038]  And they do all these horrible things.
[01:14:27.058 --> 01:14:29.260]  I don't know about your particular police in your area.
[01:14:30.314 --> 01:14:32.896]  But remember, they're going to have a daughter who goes off to college.
[01:14:32.916 --> 01:14:34.116]  This is going to happen to her.
[01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:35.197]  They're going to have a son.
[01:14:35.557 --> 01:14:37.639]  They're going to have a grandson this happens to.
[01:14:37.859 --> 01:14:40.180]  When they're old and retired, it's going to happen to them.
[01:14:41.241 --> 01:14:43.342]  You reap what you sow.
[01:14:43.462 --> 01:14:44.783]  So I wouldn't want to be them.
[01:14:45.223 --> 01:14:46.944]  God is going to punish them.
[01:14:47.184 --> 01:14:49.506]  And they don't have to wait until they go to hell.
[01:14:49.806 --> 01:14:50.927]  It's going to happen right here.
[01:14:50.947 --> 01:14:53.148]  It's going to come sooner than they think it will.
[01:14:53.894 --> 01:14:55.297]  And it's going to come by their own hands.
[01:14:55.677 --> 01:15:01.868]  You know what the number one cause of death, just department numbers but not publicized, number one cause of death for SWAT team members is?
[01:15:02.028 --> 01:15:03.591]  Yeah, there are other SWAT team members.
[01:15:03.631 --> 01:15:05.193]  That's right, those are official numbers.
[01:15:05.233 --> 01:15:05.915]  So, hey!
[01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:07.470]  I'm non-violent.
[01:15:07.630 --> 01:15:08.491]  You guys go ahead.
[01:15:09.371 --> 01:15:11.531]  Because, folks, I have seen it in my life.
[01:15:11.791 --> 01:15:14.952]  The Eastern people call it karma.
[01:15:15.012 --> 01:15:15.833]  I don't believe in that.
[01:15:16.153 --> 01:15:17.613]  But you do reap what you sow.
[01:15:18.173 --> 01:15:20.534]  And that does happen.
[01:15:20.814 --> 01:15:23.635]  For every bad thing I've done, it's come back tenfold, folks.
[01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:28.776]  And the more good I do, and the more selfless I am, and the more courage I have, the more blessed I am.
[01:15:29.576 --> 01:15:32.997]  Yeah, people don't understand that it does work just like you said.
[01:15:36.061 --> 01:15:41.800]  New Age, me, me, me generation, which is nothing more than a remade version of the hippies generation.
[01:15:42.509 --> 01:15:46.032]  You know, it's all into self-centeredness, and don't think about God.
[01:15:46.092 --> 01:15:47.733]  Don't think about anything that's important.
[01:15:47.773 --> 01:15:48.834]  Just think about yourself.
[01:15:48.874 --> 01:15:51.316]  Well, it's like Abby Newman in my video, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:15:51.356 --> 01:15:53.157]  It's their cameras, it's their microphones.
[01:15:53.578 --> 01:15:54.398]  She's at a checkpoint.
[01:15:54.418 --> 01:15:55.479]  She says, I want a warrant.
[01:15:55.499 --> 01:15:56.200]  They jerk her out.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:15:56.940]  She doesn't resist.
[01:15:57.201 --> 01:15:58.482]  They charge her with assaulting them.
[01:15:58.862 --> 01:16:03.866]  They beat you up, and then charge you with assaulting them, and then they will erase the cameras, generally.
[01:16:04.306 --> 01:16:05.727]  You know, I'm convinced of one thing.
[01:16:06.828 --> 01:16:11.612]  One of, I won't say which one, one of the intelligence agencies started the New Age movement.
[01:16:12.228 --> 01:16:14.590]  Because it's a great way... Well, sir, the Army did.
[01:16:15.010 --> 01:16:15.790]  That's a fact.
[01:16:16.431 --> 01:16:18.452]  We have the official textbooks.
[01:16:18.993 --> 01:16:29.099]  Yeah, because, you know, I first got a tip on that about several years back when I drove past regularly one of these New Age bookstores and no one was ever in it and I said, how could they stay in business?
[01:16:29.119 --> 01:16:30.220]  They've got to be subsidized.
[01:16:31.321 --> 01:16:32.882]  Well, thanks for the call.
[01:16:34.022 --> 01:16:35.583]  Really appreciate it.
[01:16:35.623 --> 01:16:38.505]  We've got a bunch of callers coming up, Buck and others, and a bunch of news.
[01:16:39.066 --> 01:16:39.666]  Stay with us.
[01:16:39.786 --> 01:16:40.367]  We're live.
[01:16:40.387 --> 01:16:40.907]  It's Thursday.
[01:16:43.556 --> 01:16:48.059]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:16:48.399 --> 01:16:52.502]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:16:52.802 --> 01:16:53.342]  We listened.
[01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:58.625]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:16:58.906 --> 01:16:59.386]  We listened.
[01:16:59.786 --> 01:17:02.808]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:17:03.248 --> 01:17:03.769]  We listened.
[01:17:04.249 --> 01:17:07.671]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[01:17:07.691 --> 01:17:07.931]  I think?
[01:17:34.855 --> 01:17:37.457]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.

[01:18:47.754 --> 01:18:55.522]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:18:55.883 --> 01:19:03.731]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:08.775]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:19:09.115 --> 01:19:13.819]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:18.203]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:19:18.703 --> 01:19:19.724]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:19.784 --> 01:19:23.867]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:19:24.288 --> 01:19:28.691]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:19:29.192 --> 01:19:31.714]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:19:32.174 --> 01:19:34.295]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:34.435 --> 01:19:36.016]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:36.256 --> 01:19:42.679]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[01:19:43.019 --> 01:19:48.662]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[01:19:48.942 --> 01:19:54.184]  You haven't alkalized your body and in fact you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[01:19:54.464 --> 01:20:02.771]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella, the two most important protein superfoods known.
[01:20:03.071 --> 01:20:05.674]  Finally, you don't consume iodized water.
[01:20:05.954 --> 01:20:13.320]  Normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:17.704]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[01:20:18.004 --> 01:20:26.733]  If you want to learn more on how you can naturally rid the body of any disease, listen to Achieving Great Health with Bob McCauley, Monday through Friday mornings at 9 a.m.
[01:20:26.753 --> 01:20:28.035]  Central, 10 Eastern.
[01:20:28.175 --> 01:20:36.864]  Call 1-888-826-4448 to learn more or visit Bob on the Internet at www.watershed.net.
[01:20:37.164 --> 01:20:39.547]  Your health simply cannot wait any longer.
[01:20:56.781 --> 01:20:59.463]  The website is InfoWars.net.
[01:20:59.844 --> 01:21:02.386]  InfoWars.net, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:03.366 --> 01:21:05.428]  The other sites are rarely down, but they are down today.
[01:21:05.448 --> 01:21:06.749]  We're having problems getting them back up.
[01:21:06.769 --> 01:21:11.313]  We think it's a kind of system failure in the background of the internet, in the area where our servers are located.
[01:21:12.358 --> 01:21:17.122]  But Infowars.net's on another server, another part of the country, so you can still visit that.
[01:21:17.522 --> 01:21:28.650]  You know, when I, when somebody's been beaten by the police, or wronged, or abused, or the cops admittedly frame a bunch of people in Houston with the crime lab, that's admitted by the police chief, I'll sarcastically say, well, they've got to stop Al-Qaeda.
[01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:30.251]  But that's the whole excuse.
[01:21:30.291 --> 01:21:31.372]  We're a thin blue line.
[01:21:31.392 --> 01:21:32.112]  We've got to do this.
[01:21:32.172 --> 01:21:36.816]  Yeah, there's some corruption, but we can't let anybody know about it, and we've got to keep going forward, and
[01:21:37.955 --> 01:21:40.076]  Now that's the sick excuse, and it's got to stop.
[01:21:40.116 --> 01:21:42.797]  A bunch of other news coming up here in just a moment, but let's go back to the calls.
[01:21:43.217 --> 01:21:44.318]  Buck in North Carolina.
[01:21:44.358 --> 01:21:45.118]  Buck, you're on the air.
[01:21:45.198 --> 01:21:45.618]  Go ahead.
[01:21:45.638 --> 01:21:52.701]  Alex, the Office of Strategic Information has been working overtime here in the Fayetteville-Fort Bragg area.
[01:21:53.321 --> 01:22:01.604]  I believe me eating our one talk show host alive this morning and referencing your website is probably the reason it's down.
[01:22:03.045 --> 01:22:04.766]  The Fayetteville Observer has
[01:22:06.273 --> 01:22:10.935]  Well, someone has done away with four articles out of their archives.
[01:22:11.296 --> 01:22:23.502]  One of them was about Fort Bragg providing security screening for the local businesses where a white male who managed his own business and kept his desk locked was a high security risk.
[01:22:23.742 --> 01:22:30.165]  Yes, that article was about three and a half years old, the Homeland Security Program, and we've contacted the paper.
[01:22:30.205 --> 01:22:33.427]  They admit the article appeared, but it's been taken out of the archives.
[01:22:34.452 --> 01:22:44.436]  Okay, number two is an environmental impact study where Fort Bragg and surrounding areas would be sprayed with bacteria to test military warning equipment.
[01:22:44.756 --> 01:22:56.740]  Now that was all over the news in Missouri, Louisiana, and this year in Goldsby and Oklahoma City we had the paper on, they admitted it, massive bacteria spraying, but you're saying that was reported and then shut down?
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:22:57.541]  That's right.
[01:22:57.961 --> 01:23:01.202]  Another is the CIA funding the Taliban
[01:23:02.066 --> 01:23:20.110]  Well, that's been in other papers, but for those that don't know, in Fort Bragg you had a case where the police shot two soldiers because they were practicing taking over city halls domestically.
[01:23:20.791 --> 01:23:28.677]  There have been a bunch of things going on there, and then there was also kind of a cover-up about the four Delta Force guys from one unit that slaughtered their wives.
[01:23:28.697 --> 01:23:31.259]  I guess they must have been without Kaida.
[01:23:31.719 --> 01:23:35.121]  But there's a lot of bizarre stuff going on in your area.
[01:23:35.141 --> 01:23:41.486]  But that article that I read on there over and over again years ago talked about how infrastructure protection
[01:23:42.353 --> 01:23:50.800]  And how they were going to put troops in all the factories and how they'd done it there domestically and quote, they were looking for white males who didn't talk a lot and lock their desks.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:51.200]  Right.
[01:23:52.421 --> 01:23:55.844]  And a fourth story... But what do they say when you call them and say, where's the story?
[01:23:56.504 --> 01:24:03.650]  Well, I had spoke with the reporters who wrote the articles and the assisted editors and the editor and
[01:24:05.656 --> 01:24:15.802]  I went to lunch with one couple of folks who work there and they said there are dozens of people in here that we have no idea who they are.
[01:24:17.183 --> 01:24:22.366]  And there was another story about the Bin Laden family being thrown out of the U.S.
[01:24:22.426 --> 01:24:24.968]  for their own safety directly after 9-11.
[01:24:25.488 --> 01:24:27.069]  That's gone from the archives.
[01:24:27.651 --> 01:24:37.215]  Well, you should ask them to find an archive at the local libraries where you gotta go, that particular, those articles, and then have them re-entered into the computer.
[01:24:38.015 --> 01:24:44.958]  They are, I have spoke with the library, it's as late as today, and no, there's nothing they can do about it.
[01:24:45.579 --> 01:24:46.399]  It's out of their hands.
[01:24:46.459 --> 01:24:48.220]  Oh, they don't have it on the microfilm anymore?
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:50.120]  No, it's no longer on the microfiche.
[01:24:50.561 --> 01:24:54.562]  Alex, I have been trying to get a cable access show since 1998.
[01:24:57.256 --> 01:25:10.264]  Now, such things as a black Christian group from a church that does a little singing and piano playing can walk in and get a Cable 9 show and no trouble at all.
[01:25:10.845 --> 01:25:15.568]  Or some idiot talking about an invisible dog fence can walk in and get a show.
[01:25:16.368 --> 01:25:20.951]  And I have been trying to show a film about Waco since 1998.
[01:25:21.312 --> 01:25:23.093]  I've got a stack of your films down there.
[01:25:23.113 --> 01:25:24.814]  Well, what do they say when you go in there?
[01:25:25.655 --> 01:25:28.156]  Well, you're on the list, Mr. Campbell.
[01:25:31.197 --> 01:25:33.278]  And it's been since 1998.
[01:25:34.398 --> 01:25:38.020]  Well, you need to go in and get their bylaws and their rules and file suit against them.
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:38.580]  I have.
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:39.980]  I've been to the county attorney.
[01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:42.201]  I've been to the county commissioners.
[01:25:42.581 --> 01:25:43.382]  Well, don't go to them.
[01:25:43.442 --> 01:25:44.722]  Just file suit on them.
[01:25:45.682 --> 01:25:47.203]  You'll be on the air in about ten minutes.
[01:25:48.562 --> 01:25:51.844]  And then if the film's having an effect, they'll shut the access station down.
[01:25:51.864 --> 01:25:58.569]  They've done it a bunch of places, from New York to New Jersey, and my name has been listed in the news articles because of my films.
[01:25:58.849 --> 01:26:00.110]  They have emergency meetings.
[01:26:00.590 --> 01:26:03.632]  In one case, feds show up and they shut the stations down.
[01:26:04.052 --> 01:26:05.773]  All because they don't want you to see these videos.
[01:26:06.774 --> 01:26:15.960]  Alex, would you have any reference to a mainstream paper that carried the article about the CIA funding the Taliban?
[01:26:17.408 --> 01:26:25.450]  MSNBC, the Miami Herald has articles we have saved on Infowars.com about flying the Bin Laden's out when all their air traffic was grounded.
[01:26:26.230 --> 01:26:27.070]  Those are a few of them.
[01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:28.230]  Anything else, sir?
[01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:29.451]  No, thank you very much.
[01:26:29.791 --> 01:26:30.751]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:26:32.531 --> 01:26:33.472]  We're on the march.

[01:26:42.404 --> 01:26:47.229]  If you're one of the millions of Americans losing their hair, chances are you've heard of Avocor.
[01:26:47.549 --> 01:26:52.915]  You've heard that Avocor has helped thousands of people, just like you, successfully regrow their hair.

[01:27:30.391 --> 01:27:33.372]  In the third hour that we are accelerating at warp speed towards
[01:27:34.665 --> 01:27:40.308]  Before I do that though, I have produced nine full-length feature documentary films.
[01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:42.029]  I have written a book.
[01:27:42.089 --> 01:27:48.973]  We also have other books and videos by other insightful authors and producers at InfoWars.net.

[01:29:40.075 --> 01:29:42.376]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:49.822]  Let's talk, I want to go through these real quick.
[01:29:50.042 --> 01:29:52.105]  Ian in Canada, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:29:52.786 --> 01:29:57.972]  Alex, hi, I'm calling about the shooting of Councilman Davis in New York City.
[01:29:58.493 --> 01:30:06.503]  The CBC report indicated that he was an anti-gun activist, particularly interested these days in banning toy guns.
[01:30:07.223 --> 01:30:15.652]  What they didn't state was precisely who shot him, except that the person was somehow connected to the city, whether as an employee or fellow council member.
[01:30:15.672 --> 01:30:16.413]  I have the report.
[01:30:16.473 --> 01:30:18.756]  They're saying that he had run for council.
[01:30:20.117 --> 01:30:21.499]  Right, he had run for council.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:23.361]  Did they give a name?
[01:30:24.802 --> 01:30:25.343]  No, they didn't.
[01:30:25.754 --> 01:30:35.822]  Well, I, you know, my antenna went up here and I'm thinking, are they running another operation, a Columbine operation, except they're not killing high school kids, they're starting to kill their own activists.
[01:30:36.162 --> 01:30:40.986]  In Switzerland, they would not pass a gun control bill.
[01:30:41.026 --> 01:30:48.852]  Everybody has automatic weapons, no gun control, lowest crime rate in the world, not just for the industrialized nations, and this particular
[01:30:49.976 --> 01:30:51.878]  Right, I thought of that Swiss event.
[01:31:05.663 --> 01:31:12.428]  Anyway, if anything comes out that smells to you, pass it on to us on that story.
[01:31:12.488 --> 01:31:14.810]  Oh, and by the way, the gun law then did pass.
[01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:21.095]  So, and by the way, New York just got the gun-grabbing lawsuit of the NAACP thrown out all over the country.
[01:31:21.115 --> 01:31:23.297]  They're banning toy guns, basically of any type.
[01:31:23.797 --> 01:31:29.702]  They're raging forward, and yeah, this poor guy will be used now, we're sorry he's dead, as a holster child.
[01:31:30.462 --> 01:31:32.784]  But take him, when they banned the guns, the crime rate exploded.
[01:31:32.844 --> 01:31:33.805]  Australia, same thing.
[01:31:34.494 --> 01:31:35.575]  They did it in Canada.
[01:31:35.595 --> 01:31:37.135]  They doubled the value of the illicit gun market.
[01:31:37.195 --> 01:31:39.016]  And we have shootings in Toronto.
[01:31:54.544 --> 01:32:01.231]  Every night, and the public, of course, they're dumbed down, they're asleep, and it's just ho-hum, they don't make the connection.
[01:32:01.731 --> 01:32:07.217]  They're establishing the foundation for a police state by this chaos.
[01:32:08.732 --> 01:32:09.532]  Anyway, you know it all.
[01:32:09.552 --> 01:32:16.976]  The New York Mayor many years ago slipped up and said that we're trying to create crime instead of the Chicago Mayor and this is what it's all about.
[01:32:17.096 --> 01:32:18.557]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:32:18.577 --> 01:32:20.018]  That's why they have the drugs illegal.
[01:32:20.418 --> 01:32:21.578]  That then boosts the price.
[01:32:21.598 --> 01:32:23.259]  Nine out of ten robberies drug-related.
[01:32:23.279 --> 01:32:25.800]  Then that creates a crisis, offers more of a solution.
[01:32:26.901 --> 01:32:27.661]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:32:28.082 --> 01:32:28.762]  Thank you, Ian.
[01:32:29.722 --> 01:32:33.028]  Mike in Illinois, then Jack in Rhode Island, Bob in New York, and Ron in New York.
[01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:34.470]  Go ahead, Mike in Illinois.
[01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:35.292]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:32:35.492 --> 01:32:36.013]  Pretty good, sir.
[01:32:36.233 --> 01:32:37.475]  Alex, I just want to say something.
[01:32:37.495 --> 01:32:42.864]  I'm not prejudiced and I don't want anyone in the air to think I am prejudiced, but I want to make a few points and I want your opinion on it.
[01:32:43.942 --> 01:32:46.584]  You know, I've lived in the United States my whole life.
[01:32:46.624 --> 01:32:48.245]  I've traveled around the world.
[01:32:48.285 --> 01:32:49.126]  I was in the military.
[01:32:49.586 --> 01:33:00.793]  But, you know, if you go back 15 years ago, Alex, and I'm sure it's like this in Texas, you go to any fast food restaurant, McDonald's, Wendy's, Taco Bell, you name it, the majority of the workers are Hispanic.
[01:33:01.434 --> 01:33:02.975]  The majority of them cannot speak English.
[01:33:03.675 --> 01:33:08.739]  Most of the time I have a bilingual Hispanic working in the restaurant and he kind of controls what's going on in there.
[01:33:09.039 --> 01:33:10.360]  Yeah, and let me break that down.
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:21.611]  Then what happens is it drives down the overall wages, breaks down the society, and if the government wanted to enforce INS rules, they would go and fine and fee and arrest all these corporate leaders.
[01:33:21.911 --> 01:33:23.212]  But that's not going to happen.
[01:33:23.653 --> 01:33:25.975]  And folks, we used to have a couple hundred thousand immigrants a year.
[01:33:26.035 --> 01:33:30.360]  Now it's millions legal, millions illegal, every year.
[01:33:31.147 --> 01:33:38.113]  And they're being filled by the Fortune 500 full of race politics, whether they're Russians or Chinese or Hispanics.
[01:33:38.134 --> 01:33:41.076]  We only talk about Hispanics because they're the majority, the 400 million.
[01:33:42.535 --> 01:33:52.442]  In Latin America, 20 million new births a year coming this way, and yeah, it's just felony crimes being committed everywhere, but the government is legitimizing it.
[01:33:52.462 --> 01:33:57.946]  800 plus cities accept fake IDs from Poland, Mexico, Venezuela, the matriculars.
[01:33:58.566 --> 01:34:00.788]  It's just wholesale destruction of the republic.
[01:34:01.048 --> 01:34:07.953]  Absolutely, Alex, and you know what, and the other thing I wanted to make a point is, I have a relative who works for the state of Illinois, and she told me
[01:34:08.653 --> 01:34:20.365]  She heard that, you know, a lot of these gas stations and convenience stores and Dunkin Donuts are all being bought up by Pakistani or Indians and they're supposedly tanked, at least in the state of Illinois, she said.
[01:34:20.405 --> 01:34:22.928]  She knows that they're tax exempt for seven years.
[01:34:22.988 --> 01:34:25.491]  Now, Alex, if there's any truth to it, then she said they milk the system.
[01:34:26.031 --> 01:34:28.632]  And what they'll do is they'll bring a brother... Sir, sir, that's true.
[01:34:29.392 --> 01:34:31.513]  Foreigners get a seven-year tax exemption.
[01:34:32.053 --> 01:34:36.494]  Orrin Hatch, Senator from Utah, wants to give the illegals more tuition.
[01:34:36.514 --> 01:34:37.114]  I read the bill.
[01:34:37.194 --> 01:34:38.074]  Not just as much.
[01:34:38.434 --> 01:34:39.775]  More tuition than citizens.
[01:34:39.895 --> 01:34:47.497]  It's a magnet to bring hundreds of millions of people in who will then pull the lever for gun control and big government and everything else.
[01:34:48.377 --> 01:34:49.257]  It's horrible, Alex.
[01:34:50.258 --> 01:34:51.438]  We gotta do something about it right away?
[01:34:51.458 --> 01:34:55.519]  Well, I think that discriminating against citizens, whether they're black, white, or Hispanic, is good.
[01:34:56.303 --> 01:35:00.085]  And I think hover drones looking through your walls, Baltimore Sun today, is good.
[01:35:00.625 --> 01:35:03.706]  I mean, I think having total tyranny is what freedom is all about.
[01:35:03.726 --> 01:35:06.487]  Alex, you've got great films.
[01:35:06.507 --> 01:35:08.428]  9-11 was the last one I saw.
[01:35:08.448 --> 01:35:10.309]  It's a great film.
[01:35:10.329 --> 01:35:11.589]  It wakes people up.
[01:35:11.649 --> 01:35:13.870]  But what really scares me is all those things that they show.
[01:35:14.711 --> 01:35:22.294]  They're brief clips in your film, but they're great if you catch it about all the sonar, these things that can make people nauseous over a wide range.
[01:35:22.998 --> 01:35:27.141]  Well, they are mounting Humvees with all different sorts of pulse weapons, microwave weapons.
[01:35:27.622 --> 01:35:30.744]  They're mounting the helicopters with spray bottles to knock out whole cities.
[01:35:30.764 --> 01:35:31.925]  They're building giant camps.
[01:35:32.225 --> 01:35:33.226]  Hey, it's all part of freedom!
[01:35:34.307 --> 01:35:34.987]  Hey, thanks Alex.
[01:35:35.167 --> 01:35:36.148]  It's all mainstream news.
[01:35:36.228 --> 01:35:39.691]  Rocky Mountain News, AP, Reuters, BBC, LA Times.
[01:35:40.191 --> 01:35:41.432]  It's all good.
[01:35:42.693 --> 01:35:46.316]  Rocky Mountain News reported on the mass graves and incinerators ready for you and your family.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:47.760]  That's all good.
[01:35:48.281 --> 01:35:49.281]  Submit to it, folks.
[01:35:50.002 --> 01:35:51.622]  Jack in Rhode Island, thanks for holding.
[01:35:51.662 --> 01:35:52.283]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:35:52.563 --> 01:35:53.363]  Yeah, hey, Alex.
[01:35:53.403 --> 01:35:55.024]  I don't know if you covered this today.
[01:35:55.044 --> 01:35:58.766]  Have you seen the new pictures of Uday and Kuse that they've released?
[01:35:58.866 --> 01:35:59.626]  Oh, that's now.
[01:35:59.686 --> 01:36:01.327]  Well, they were saying this morning they'd be released.
[01:36:01.367 --> 01:36:03.028]  We'll post them on Infowars.net.
[01:36:03.308 --> 01:36:04.449]  You're saying they have been released?
[01:36:04.469 --> 01:36:05.449]  Yeah, I'm looking at them.
[01:36:06.910 --> 01:36:08.452]  I mean, this is, it's ridiculous.
[01:36:08.592 --> 01:36:17.580]  I guess Uday, you know, Kuse, he's covered in blood and he's bald, though he does seem to have a full head of hair a couple of months ago.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:26.649]  Outside the beard, it probably took about three to six months to grow, though again, six, eight weeks ago we saw he had a clean-shaven face with a mustache.
[01:36:27.289 --> 01:36:32.374]  The pictures are dark and bloody and really look nothing like the two men.
[01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:35.531]  So this is the evidence, and they're announcing this.
[01:36:35.571 --> 01:36:39.672]  But of course they announced they killed him three other times, and it was for sure and totally documented.
[01:36:39.832 --> 01:36:47.834]  And the copy and the text that goes with these pictures is this now quells the skepticism that the once dreaded influential Hussein brothers were still alive.
[01:36:47.874 --> 01:36:53.055]  So this is now proof and evidence, but you've got to see these pictures because it's just ridiculous.
[01:36:53.095 --> 01:36:57.056]  I mean, it's like that Saddam Hussein look-alike with the big fat nose.
[01:36:57.136 --> 01:37:01.677]  Now, Baghdad Bob is very truthful, and so is Ghani Akraf.
[01:37:02.497 --> 01:37:03.938]  I mean, do they think that we're stupid?
[01:37:04.818 --> 01:37:06.438]  Hey, the bigger the lie, the more they'll believe it.
[01:37:06.478 --> 01:37:09.779]  Just like Baghdad, Bob's a congenital liar, so's the White House.
[01:37:09.879 --> 01:37:11.300]  And why did they go in and kill these guys?
[01:37:11.320 --> 01:37:14.221]  Wouldn't it have been better evidence to take them alive?
[01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:17.162]  Well, they fought back, and you can't have them alive, and you know.
[01:37:17.182 --> 01:37:21.023]  Of course, the news is they were flown out to Belarus and Russia.
[01:37:21.663 --> 01:37:26.104]  And our government admits they paid off the Iraqi leadership in gold bars and euros and dollars.
[01:37:26.144 --> 01:37:26.864]  That's all admitted.
[01:37:26.884 --> 01:37:29.125]  But after the war, they said, we never said that.
[01:37:29.745 --> 01:37:37.066]  Just like Rumsfeld never said in press conferences that it was all about hidden weapons of mass destruction, he's now said before Congress that he never said that.
[01:37:37.146 --> 01:37:40.327]  So you have a disease of a long-term memory.
[01:37:40.507 --> 01:37:42.848]  I mean, this is an insult to the intelligence, of course.
[01:37:42.868 --> 01:37:43.648]  Well, how dare you?
[01:37:43.668 --> 01:37:45.368]  You're obviously working with al-Qaeda.
[01:37:45.928 --> 01:37:46.368]  Thanks, buddy.
[01:37:46.528 --> 01:37:47.069]  Thanks, Jack.
[01:37:47.529 --> 01:37:48.329]  Bob in New York.
[01:37:48.369 --> 01:37:48.989]  Go ahead, Bob.
[01:37:49.835 --> 01:37:50.035]  Alex?
[01:37:50.055 --> 01:37:50.955]  Yes, sir?
[01:37:51.356 --> 01:37:53.536]  Calling about one of those episodes of Cops.
[01:37:53.977 --> 01:38:00.859]  I usually don't ever watch any of those, but I started watching them, you know, just to check things out.
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:07.802]  Well, that's all to train us as a gladiatorial running man type event that we're like cattle being hunted.
[01:38:08.062 --> 01:38:09.783]  Well, this one was really weird.
[01:38:09.843 --> 01:38:12.784]  What it had was, the title was Grand Theft Auto.
[01:38:13.584 --> 01:38:17.485]  They had pulled this woman over, white woman, and there was a black woman with her.
[01:38:18.185 --> 01:38:20.486]  They had run the tags and it came up stolen.
[01:38:21.066 --> 01:38:28.708]  While they were interviewing the suspects, in the background there were two guys in fatigues.
[01:38:29.728 --> 01:38:30.269]  Camo.
[01:38:30.669 --> 01:38:31.529]  Green camo.
[01:38:32.418 --> 01:38:38.720]  Well, I get to looking when they first pulled the car out, they all drew their guns and they had them, you know, beat it down.
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:42.381]  They told them, get out of your car and walk backwards and go to your knees.
[01:38:42.882 --> 01:38:45.282]  You know, this whole police state training video.
[01:38:45.783 --> 01:38:49.324]  But in the background, they never talked about the guy in fatigues.
[01:38:50.024 --> 01:39:04.949]  And they never mentioned him at all, but the one guy had a... Well, they said publicly they want to get rid of Posse Comintonis and put troops on the streets for... Exactly, and the one guy had a military MP, a military police armband on.
[01:39:05.349 --> 01:39:08.570]  But they never mentioned anything about the military at all.
[01:39:08.650 --> 01:39:10.170]  Well, it's for your safety.
[01:39:10.210 --> 01:39:15.092]  And they said in the news that they want to use him on the streets and for all crimes and Patriot Act power.
[01:39:16.027 --> 01:39:18.709]  But that's, again, part of a free society is troops on the streets.
[01:39:19.169 --> 01:39:20.610]  Desensitization.
[01:39:21.791 --> 01:39:24.112]  You know, one little other comment really quick.
[01:39:24.192 --> 01:39:33.098]  I don't follow this garbage in the media, but Kobe Bryant, Fox News, made the comment that, well, now that he's raped somebody, maybe he'll have better street cred.
[01:39:33.118 --> 01:39:41.464]  In other words, he can sell more Nike slave shoes because now he's one of the bad boys, like all the other NBA scumbags.
[01:39:42.205 --> 01:39:42.605]  Thank you.
[01:39:42.825 --> 01:39:45.086]  Well, these are our children's role models.
[01:39:45.146 --> 01:39:46.206]  How dare you?
[01:39:46.926 --> 01:39:53.167]  Not the Founding Fathers, not Audie Murphy, but, you know, what's your problem?
[01:39:53.388 --> 01:39:54.388]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:54.648 --> 01:39:55.128]  Thanks, sir.
[01:39:55.408 --> 01:39:57.829]  Sounds like an Al-Qaeda member to me.
[01:39:58.489 --> 01:39:59.289]  Ron in New York.
[01:39:59.349 --> 01:40:00.349]  Last caller for this hour.
[01:40:00.369 --> 01:40:01.189]  I'm getting some news.
[01:40:01.209 --> 01:40:01.789]  Go ahead, Ron.
[01:40:01.809 --> 01:40:02.530]  Hi, Alex.
[01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:08.831]  I want to get to the main topic I discussed, but you had mentioned the shooting of the Councilman in New York City.
[01:40:09.438 --> 01:40:13.179]  I was slightly acquainted with a lay councilman in my time.
[01:40:13.219 --> 01:40:13.619]  I knew him.
[01:40:13.639 --> 01:40:17.640]  We'd done some work together, social advocacy work, about eight, nine years back.
[01:40:20.041 --> 01:40:29.503]  He was shot by a guy named Othoniel Askew, who was a supposed political opponent within his district in the borough of Brooklyn, New York.
[01:40:30.823 --> 01:40:35.565]  The caller had mentioned that the lay councilman was involved in something.
[01:40:35.885 --> 01:40:36.985]  He was involved in a program.
[01:40:37.481 --> 01:40:40.142]  It's kind of odd.
[01:40:41.103 --> 01:40:43.004]  He didn't fit a mold.
[01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:50.608]  He was involved with banning toy guns in Toys R Us stores at that time, about a decade or so back.
[01:40:51.288 --> 01:40:59.812]  Yet after he did achieve office in New York, he was kind of reluctant to go along with gun control or passing any more gun control laws in the city of New York.
[01:40:59.852 --> 01:41:02.353]  He kind of felt we were inundated with enough of them already.
[01:41:02.874 --> 01:41:05.215]  So his behavior really didn't fit any type of
[01:41:05.615 --> 01:41:06.956]  You know, a pattern like that.
[01:41:06.976 --> 01:41:14.579]  He was pretty much an independent thinker, who at times even had upset his own political party, which was he was a Democrat in New York.
[01:41:14.619 --> 01:41:15.920]  He was something of a maverick.
[01:41:16.660 --> 01:41:21.302]  And, you know, I wish him and his family my sympathies.
[01:41:21.782 --> 01:41:26.805]  So do I. But, now getting to another subject.
[01:41:27.405 --> 01:41:27.645]  Real quick.
[01:41:27.665 --> 01:41:29.406]  Gateline, Monday, Daily News.
[01:41:30.026 --> 01:41:33.788]  In New York State, the state court system, the Office of Court Administration,
[01:41:34.784 --> 01:42:00.449]  had database and did this rather quietly 3.2 million names of people all right the majority about 2.2 million of the names in there were people who were convicted of very very low status offenses yeah I mean it's going to be used to deny misdemeanor offense folks for owning guns right well I'll tell you what very low status offenses they thought the cases were sealed they weren't I called the office of court administration
[01:42:01.007 --> 01:42:05.889]  Which is a public agency and it's the court's, therefore it is supposed to be transparent and open.
[01:42:06.409 --> 01:42:09.530]  And they said national security, are you with Alcoa?
[01:42:09.550 --> 01:42:10.951]  Well, I'll tell you what they said.
[01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:15.892]  When I called up, I spoke to a gentleman in our state capitol who was a pretty rude guy.
[01:42:15.912 --> 01:42:25.836]  And when I asked him if they will be sharing this database information with the federal government, the guy actually said, you know, he refused to answer and that may be secret information.
[01:42:26.676 --> 01:42:27.456]  I said, of course!
[01:42:27.576 --> 01:42:28.137]  No, no, no.
[01:42:28.177 --> 01:42:29.257]  States want to make their
[01:42:29.961 --> 01:42:32.023]  General votes, secret, everything.
[01:42:32.463 --> 01:42:33.384]  Everything's secret.
[01:42:33.444 --> 01:42:34.625]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[01:42:35.266 --> 01:42:35.947]  There's some freedom.
[01:42:35.987 --> 01:42:38.949]  The court system is supposed to be transparent and public and open.
[01:42:38.989 --> 01:42:40.651]  It's not an investigative agency.
[01:42:40.691 --> 01:42:48.098]  Hey, right here in Austin, former city council member George Humphrey yesterday said he went down to give a letter to a city council member and it's all an armored compound.
[01:42:48.138 --> 01:42:49.119]  You can't get in to see him.
[01:42:49.139 --> 01:42:51.081]  It's all part of the new freedom, sir.
[01:42:51.381 --> 01:42:53.563]  Yeah, this is some freedom we have when our courts
[01:42:53.936 --> 01:42:59.898]  You know, I thought secret courts were something or secret court systems were something that existed in dictatorships and banana republics.
[01:42:59.939 --> 01:43:12.164]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:43:21.661 --> 01:43:24.322]  You gotta start realizing how to be a free human, okay?
[01:43:24.422 --> 01:43:25.523]  That means total slavery.
[01:43:25.643 --> 01:43:26.203]  Alright, good.
[01:43:26.323 --> 01:43:27.904]  And remember, Reuters polled.
[01:43:28.765 --> 01:43:30.485]  Poll shows many Germans see U.S.
[01:43:30.505 --> 01:43:31.566]  behind September 11th.
[01:43:31.586 --> 01:43:33.447]  68% think there's a cover-up.
[01:43:34.527 --> 01:43:36.388]  And 30% believe the U.S.
[01:43:36.408 --> 01:43:38.789]  government may have sponsored the September 11th attacks.
[01:43:38.829 --> 01:43:42.351]  That's Reuters, and again, they're all crazy too, I guess.
[01:43:43.192 --> 01:43:45.853]  That's on Infowars.net right now.
[01:43:46.833 --> 01:43:47.734]  Also, FAA.
[01:43:48.809 --> 01:43:52.050]  Okay, sought for drones, and this is Warriors.
[01:43:52.611 --> 01:44:00.234]  Pilotless military aircraft can be valuable civilian use in the petroleum industry, in law enforcement, and in homeland security.
[01:44:00.754 --> 01:44:16.020]  Their makers say, and unmanned planes have proven their worth in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and have now, those who build them are thinking beyond the battlefield, and Senator Warner's called for this, to a day when pilotless drones may fly in the nation's civilian airspace, and there's a bill to do that.
[01:44:17.483 --> 01:44:27.808]  Defense industry and government officials taking part in a symposium on robotic technology and unmanned flight met at the Baltimore Convention Center yesterday to begin an effort to bring that day closer.
[01:44:28.248 --> 01:44:38.174]  At the convention center they had armored mini-tanks, remote-controlled for crowd control, that sounds like a free society, armored black mini-tanks with microwave guns on the top.
[01:44:39.174 --> 01:44:40.935]  Sounds like freedom, not like a horror movie.
[01:44:42.834 --> 01:44:44.155]  And it was good for 1984.
[01:44:44.235 --> 01:44:45.536]  It's good for us.
[01:44:45.797 --> 01:44:46.898]  And a little hover drone.
[01:44:46.918 --> 01:44:51.723]  There's another article here about the drones are being mounted with stuff that looks through your walls with high-powered radar.
[01:44:52.744 --> 01:44:54.525]  Again, that's freedom, as I've been saying all day.
[01:44:54.545 --> 01:44:56.147]  Now, we'll get into that.
[01:44:56.167 --> 01:45:00.051]  I've got a bunch of 9-1-1 news here and more on Iraq.
[01:45:00.151 --> 01:45:01.612]  And it's just a lot more coming up.
[01:45:01.632 --> 01:45:01.993]  Stay with us.

[01:46:04.238 --> 01:46:08.742]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:46:09.082 --> 01:46:13.186]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:46:13.486 --> 01:46:14.026]  We listened.
[01:46:14.327 --> 01:46:19.331]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:46:19.591 --> 01:46:20.071]  We listened.
[01:46:20.472 --> 01:46:23.494]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:46:23.935 --> 01:46:24.475]  We listened.
[01:46:24.935 --> 01:46:27.978]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:46:27.978 --> 01:46:28.338]  We're good.
[01:46:54.821 --> 01:46:58.823]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:46:59.303 --> 01:47:00.703]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:47:02.584 --> 01:47:06.926]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:47:07.106 --> 01:47:11.528]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:47:11.688 --> 01:47:16.049]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:47:16.169 --> 01:47:17.450]  A New World Order.
[01:47:18.110 --> 01:47:19.572]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:47:32.947 --> 01:47:43.395]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:47:43.575 --> 01:47:48.959]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:47:53.923 --> 01:47:55.644]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:48:06.366 --> 01:48:12.408]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:48:13.008 --> 01:48:15.989]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:48:18.650 --> 01:48:29.353]  Most of us have heard the frog in the boiling pot of water analogy, that if you put a frog, you throw a frog in boiling water, it will jump out.
[01:48:29.933 --> 01:48:32.954]  But if you put it in cold water and turn the heat up slowly, it'll boil.
[01:48:33.094 --> 01:48:35.155]  It'll sit there as the heat goes up incrementally.
[01:48:35.825 --> 01:48:36.566]  And it will die.
[01:48:36.766 --> 01:48:38.527]  And the frog did boil, folks.
[01:48:38.607 --> 01:48:39.828]  We're in tyranny.
[01:48:40.408 --> 01:48:41.829]  They built the infrastructure.
[01:48:41.869 --> 01:48:48.833]  They're engaging in tyranny against the people, whether you're for their system or against it, every day, in a compartmentalized fashion.
[01:48:48.873 --> 01:48:50.774]  People don't know how to communicate with each other.
[01:48:51.175 --> 01:48:53.156]  The media keeps this illusion going.
[01:48:53.476 --> 01:48:56.218]  The globalists are fighting to shut down alternative media.
[01:48:58.559 --> 01:48:59.240]  It's incredible.
[01:49:01.201 --> 01:49:01.341]  And
[01:49:02.808 --> 01:49:10.371]  People have to start valuing alternative information and spreading the word about alternative information every way they can.
[01:49:10.451 --> 01:49:15.694]  And I've talked to my IT guy, Dwayne Coots, and he's never seen anything like it.
[01:49:15.794 --> 01:49:19.475]  It is a massive attack.
[01:49:19.755 --> 01:49:21.456]  Denial of service, you name it.
[01:49:21.576 --> 01:49:23.017]  Multiple forms of attacks.
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:32.907]  On the entire server farm and particular offshoot feeding InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:49:33.387 --> 01:49:36.970]  Because, you know, the site gets tens of millions of visitors a month now, literally.
[01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:44.516]  And so, you know, sometimes at midnight or something, when it reloads or something, it'll go down for a few minutes and then we fix it.
[01:49:44.696 --> 01:49:45.457]  It's still rare.
[01:49:46.909 --> 01:50:01.899]  This one is huge and sustained, and you know, it'll just make people go to the site more because they can't get to it, but InfoWars.net is up, and we're putting the photos of Kwesi and the Saddam Brothers, the sons, up on the site.
[01:50:01.919 --> 01:50:03.961]  So InfoWars.net's there and has been updated.
[01:50:04.561 --> 01:50:09.424]  And I'm just going to launch three or four more sites quicker now on other, even bigger servers.
[01:50:10.865 --> 01:50:13.007]  I'm just going to grow it, and so we're going to have
[01:50:14.682 --> 01:50:15.002]  Who knows?
[01:50:15.042 --> 01:50:16.123]  Maybe I'll have ten servers.
[01:50:16.163 --> 01:50:17.744]  Maybe I'll have ten different websites.
[01:50:19.425 --> 01:50:22.447]  Maybe I'll have ten sites mirroring the same information.
[01:50:22.888 --> 01:50:24.369]  We'll do whatever it takes, folks.
[01:50:26.330 --> 01:50:36.457]  But, you know, we've had people hack in before and put, you know, a naked woman on a motorcycle on the main page, but then our system's designed to shut down if that happens so no one ever saw it.
[01:50:37.158 --> 01:50:38.218]  This is stuff like that.
[01:50:38.238 --> 01:50:40.300]  I mean, you know, we're in a war for this country, folks.
[01:50:41.073 --> 01:50:42.874]  And the globalists aren't going to go away easily.
[01:50:42.934 --> 01:50:45.596]  I mean, they attack a lot of people's sites, and that's been in the news.
[01:50:47.077 --> 01:50:52.100]  And on the other side, there's a lot of good people that are fighting the New World Order, that are resisting what they're doing.
[01:50:53.321 --> 01:50:57.583]  And the New World Order wants to put you in prison for life if you download music.
[01:50:58.164 --> 01:51:00.745]  It's gone from destroying your computer to life in prison.
[01:51:02.446 --> 01:51:04.067]  They're trying to pass that.
[01:51:04.087 --> 01:51:08.330]  I mean, it shows what thugs they are, as they attack everybody's website, left and right.
[01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:15.445]  But who knows, maybe I'll have to build a website that can take, you know, 15 million hits in one second.
[01:51:15.665 --> 01:51:20.610]  I don't know how we do that, but those aren't actual visitors, folks.
[01:51:21.050 --> 01:51:21.911]  Those are attacks.
[01:51:24.793 --> 01:51:26.095]  Department of Defense stuff.
[01:51:26.735 --> 01:51:27.576]  But hey!
[01:51:28.326 --> 01:51:28.606]  You know?
[01:51:28.626 --> 01:51:31.787]  That's what fighting for the Republic is all about, folks.
[01:51:32.007 --> 01:51:37.208]  They don't want you to read about the drones and the microchips and the slavery from their own publications.
[01:51:37.448 --> 01:51:40.649]  They don't want it all posted in one spot every day.
[01:51:41.009 --> 01:51:42.149]  Mountains of their evil.
[01:51:42.649 --> 01:51:44.009]  Mountains of their corruption.
[01:51:45.469 --> 01:51:47.670]  Because we're hurting them so bad.
[01:51:47.890 --> 01:51:53.331]  So a counterattack shows that they're trying to attack our key infrastructure and it's not going to work.
[01:51:54.531 --> 01:51:55.972]  There's too many sites telling the truth.
[01:51:56.032 --> 01:51:57.812]  In fact, you need to start your own website, folks.
[01:51:58.522 --> 01:51:59.163]  And it's happening.
[01:51:59.603 --> 01:52:02.925]  Millions of Patriot websites instead of tens of thousands.
[01:52:02.965 --> 01:52:06.127]  We need all of you who are Patriots to start your own websites.
[01:52:07.688 --> 01:52:12.792]  By the way, Patriots are the biggest chunk of the web next to pornography.
[01:52:12.852 --> 01:52:15.273]  So that's still number one, but we're a close second.
[01:52:15.774 --> 01:52:16.534]  And they're panicking.
[01:52:17.735 --> 01:52:20.357]  Alright, FBI Chief praises the Patriot Act.
[01:52:20.377 --> 01:52:21.117]  That's coming up.
[01:52:21.878 --> 01:52:24.099]  Applied digital okays with three...
[01:52:26.053 --> 01:52:34.778]  Criminal countries, Russia, Colombia, Venezuela, China, and others with particular agreements with Russia, Colombia, and Venezuela for implantable chips for their population.
[01:52:36.259 --> 01:52:38.681]  I'm not going to take calls for the next 30 minutes or the next hour.
[01:52:38.701 --> 01:52:41.463]  I'm going to cover news, get through that, then we'll take calls the last 30 minutes.
[01:52:42.483 --> 01:52:43.104]  So stay with us.
[01:52:43.124 --> 01:52:48.627]  The third hour is straight ahead as we go out on AM, FM, Internet, shortwave, satellite.
[01:52:49.107 --> 01:52:51.589]  We're always looking for new venues to be multifaceted.
[01:52:53.815 --> 01:52:56.836]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:52:57.157 --> 01:53:02.079]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:53:02.339 --> 01:53:11.723]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they are in... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.284 --> 01:53:19.925]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.585 --> 01:53:21.666]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.367 --> 01:53:23.468]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:24.108 --> 01:53:24.929]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.689 --> 01:53:26.590]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:26.610 --> 01:53:30.993]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.453 --> 01:53:35.556]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:36.617 --> 01:53:42.742]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, as we defend the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:53:43.742 --> 01:53:46.885]  Already into the third and final hour of this live Thursday edition.
[01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:49.790]  I'm going to launch straight into the news and information.
[01:53:49.810 --> 01:53:52.490]  And we're going to open the phones up later in this hour.
[01:53:52.530 --> 01:53:55.051]  If you'd like to get lined up and ready to go, I'd love to hear from you.
[01:53:55.611 --> 01:53:58.352]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:58.752 --> 01:54:04.514]  My website is infowars.net.
[01:54:04.594 --> 01:54:07.235]  That's got the big update for you for the news we're covering.
[01:54:07.255 --> 01:54:14.677]  If you'd like to go check it out, like the headline I covered earlier in the last hour,
[01:54:15.698 --> 01:54:19.825]  A large portion of Germans, poll shows many Germans see U.S.
[01:54:19.906 --> 01:54:22.590]  behind September 11, but it's not the U.S.
[01:54:22.610 --> 01:54:23.011]  government.
[01:54:23.592 --> 01:54:29.182]  It's the global government using America as its proxy to carry out its criminal activities.
[01:54:31.181 --> 01:54:34.323]  So, let's now launch into some of the other news items.
[01:54:34.524 --> 01:54:36.805]  FBI Chief praises the Patriot Act.
[01:54:36.845 --> 01:54:40.828]  Well, the Republican-controlled legislature of Alaska just voted it down.
[01:54:41.329 --> 01:54:49.795]  Other Republican-controlled states and cities are now doing it, panicking the neocons because they need to keep their envelope, their cloak of neoconservatism going.
[01:54:50.255 --> 01:54:54.979]  People are now waking up to them, thanks to Ron Paul and others, exposing the fact that they're a bunch of Trotskyites.
[01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:58.481]  FBI Chief praises the Patriot Act.
[01:54:58.501 --> 01:55:00.042]  This is from the Washington Times.
[01:55:00.122 --> 01:55:04.744]  FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III yesterday told the Senate Committee the U.S.
[01:55:04.764 --> 01:55:10.827]  Patriot Act has made the Bureau more effective at facilitating information sharing within the law enforcement and intelligence communities.
[01:55:12.267 --> 01:55:15.529]  Of course, the Justice Department admits it will be used for all crimes against all citizens.
[01:55:16.249 --> 01:55:25.133]  Prior to the passage of the Act, the FBI agents were walled off from intelligence investigations by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA, Mr. Mueller said.
[01:55:26.892 --> 01:55:28.335]  I think it goes into a bunch of lies.
[01:55:29.777 --> 01:55:31.640]  Continuing here with the news.
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:36.609]  Applied, okayed, 10 million distribution deal in three countries.
[01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:40.616]  This is out of the South Florida Business Journal.
[01:55:41.545 --> 01:55:59.367]  Home Beach-based technology development company Applied Digital Solutions, NASDAQ ADSX, that has signed distribution agreements in three countries that call for minimum purchase requirements to maintain five-year exclusivity at more than $10 million each at current prices.
[01:56:00.211 --> 01:56:10.239]  The distribution agreements in Russia, Colombia, Venezuela call for the distributions to sell at least 75,000 Verachips and 35,000 Verachip scanners within five years.
[01:56:10.299 --> 01:56:14.943]  Verachip is under the skin radio frequency identification device.
[01:56:16.945 --> 01:56:20.628]  We have their press release here from Ply Digital.
[01:56:21.917 --> 01:56:24.679]  Communist China set up the plant at a military base.
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:28.382]  IBM's the real owner of the company, if you read their financial papers.
[01:56:28.942 --> 01:56:31.404]  Hosted on Applied Digital's website.
[01:56:32.105 --> 01:56:38.750]  It's IBM with the Communist Chinese, a massive 1,300,000,000 slaves to be implanted.
[01:56:39.931 --> 01:56:40.991]  All part of freedom.
[01:56:41.031 --> 01:56:42.653]  If you're against it, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:56:44.194 --> 01:56:44.914]  Here's another one.
[01:56:45.475 --> 01:56:49.518]  Cracking chips eyed by retailers despite privacy concerns.
[01:56:50.248 --> 01:56:59.895]  Tiny new radio-emitting chips for tracking retail products from factory to checkout represent a dream for retailers, but a nightmare for privacy activists.
[01:57:00.456 --> 01:57:07.581]  The so-called Radio Frequency Identification Chips, the size of Pinhead, could be placed on anything from soup cans to sneakers.
[01:57:08.200 --> 01:57:20.505]  The chips would eventually replace Marcos, which identify only a type of product, with the ability to identify individual items and allow suppliers and retailers to know exactly what is on their shelves and inventory.
[01:57:21.245 --> 01:57:35.631]  But a tag, a microchip with an antenna, can, on a can of Coke, a pair of jeans, or a car axle, and suddenly a computer can see it, says brochure from the industry-funded Auto-ID Center of Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
[01:57:36.488 --> 01:57:40.611]  Put tags on every can of coke, every pair of jeans, and every axle, and suddenly the world changes.
[01:57:40.651 --> 01:57:41.952]  No more inventory counts.
[01:57:42.533 --> 01:57:47.677]  And then they admit it's hooked in with the Department of Defense and Homeland Security to track you and your family.
[01:57:49.939 --> 01:57:51.200]  More on that coming up.
[01:57:52.701 --> 01:57:54.343]  We'll get into child tracking devices.
[01:57:55.383 --> 01:57:56.825]  We'll get into the projects.
[01:57:57.365 --> 01:57:59.567]  Some of the new technologies being deployed against you.
[01:58:00.447 --> 01:58:04.711]  We'll get into more on Dr. Kelly, who was obviously murdered.
[01:58:04.731 --> 01:58:05.832]  They're saying suicide.
[01:58:06.891 --> 01:58:12.502]  We'll get into more on Iraq and the thing that looks like a lie with Saddam's dead sons.
[01:58:15.055 --> 01:58:18.936]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:58:19.176 --> 01:58:24.617]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:58:24.897 --> 01:58:35.259]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:58:35.419 --> 01:58:39.760]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:43.541]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine
[01:58:43.781 --> 01:58:48.323]  Benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:58:48.583 --> 01:58:54.965]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:58:55.065 --> 01:58:59.547]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:58:59.767 --> 01:59:03.969]  Normally $48 each, get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:59:04.229 --> 01:59:08.671]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:14.734 --> 01:59:19.078]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:59:19.238 --> 01:59:23.681]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:59:23.821 --> 01:59:28.205]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[01:59:28.305 --> 01:59:29.566]  A New World Order.
[01:59:31.370 --> 01:59:35.591]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:59:35.651 --> 01:59:42.573]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:59:42.713 --> 01:59:44.793]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:59:45.094 --> 01:59:55.196]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:59:55.717 --> 02:00:01.123]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you!
[02:00:01.583 --> 02:00:04.807]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:04.847 --> 02:00:05.347]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:00:05.367 --> 02:00:06.649]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:00:13.957 --> 02:00:16.719]  You're losing your hair and you haven't tried Avocor yet?
[02:00:17.159 --> 02:00:19.621]  You've heard all about it on radio and TV for years.
[02:00:19.841 --> 02:00:23.784]  Well, there's a reason why Avocor has become the most recognized name in hair regrowth.
[02:00:24.104 --> 02:00:31.890]  Simply because tens of thousands of people just like you have successfully regrown their hair and regained that youthful appearance thanks to Avocor.
[02:00:32.230 --> 02:00:32.670]  That's right.
[02:00:32.970 --> 02:00:39.892]  Avocor's all-natural DHT blocker and physician's topical formula have reversed hair loss for virtually everyone who has ordered.
[02:00:40.372 --> 02:00:41.492]  So why haven't you called?
[02:00:41.912 --> 02:00:52.834]  We realize there's a lot of confusion out there, but while so many hair growth products come and go, Avocor's clinical studies and claims of success have been independently reviewed and proven true.
[02:00:53.334 --> 02:00:54.215]  Still not convinced?
[02:00:54.555 --> 02:00:58.575]  Avocor is so effective that it comes with a full one-year money-back guarantee.
[02:00:58.675 --> 02:00:59.936]  Try getting that anywhere else.
[02:01:00.136 --> 02:01:01.416]  To order Avocor, call
[02:01:01.496 --> 02:01:01.636]  Call 800-533-7298.
[02:01:01.676 --> 02:01:03.999]  The sooner you call, the sooner you can reverse your hair loss.
[02:01:04.059 --> 02:01:04.239]  Call 800-533-7298.
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:04.620]  That's 800-533-7298.
[02:01:19.213 --> 02:01:19.854]  Big Brother.
[02:01:20.534 --> 02:01:21.555]  Mainstream media.
[02:01:22.296 --> 02:01:23.416]  Government cover-ups.
[02:01:24.057 --> 02:01:24.878]  You want answers?
[02:01:25.618 --> 02:01:26.539]  Well, so does he.
[02:01:26.559 --> 02:01:30.922]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:31.383 --> 02:01:35.506]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:01:38.968 --> 02:01:42.191]  Alex, you're 30 seconds into the third and final hour today.
[02:01:42.211 --> 02:01:44.533]  Your calls are coming up, but let me get back into the news.
[02:01:45.299 --> 02:01:51.643]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[02:01:52.804 --> 02:01:58.087]  And the website is Infowars.net, freshly updated today for you.
[02:01:58.107 --> 02:02:04.171]  Just briefly recapping, because I know a lot of stations carry the news in the first five-minute segment.
[02:02:05.592 --> 02:02:08.414]  The Florida Business Journal is reporting that Mexico
[02:02:09.969 --> 02:02:10.729]  We're good to go.
[02:02:25.140 --> 02:02:27.902]  Just implantable, trackable, under the skin chips.
[02:02:27.982 --> 02:02:33.406]  Now I was a kook 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago talking about this and the last 2 years I'm not a kook anymore.
[02:02:33.446 --> 02:02:42.974]  You just say, oh yeah, the government wants us to take implantable, trackable, microchips, really RFID tags is what they are, radio frequency identification tags is what they are.
[02:02:43.917 --> 02:02:45.197]  They want us to go ahead and take that.
[02:02:45.257 --> 02:02:52.019]  And then there's another big story here with the headline, Tracking Chips Eyed by Retailers.
[02:02:52.059 --> 02:02:57.620]  Despite privacy concerns, the tiny chips will be embedded in your shoes and clothes and soup cans to track you.
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:02.041]  They'll have your name scanned on it when you check out if you want the return policy.
[02:03:02.442 --> 02:03:03.502]  That's how they're starting it.
[02:03:04.042 --> 02:03:11.744]  And it did come out a few weeks ago, the Department of Defense and Homeland Security has been meeting with the RFID groups and Walmart, pushing all of this.
[02:03:12.833 --> 02:03:14.374]  That doesn't sound like freedom, does it?
[02:03:14.414 --> 02:03:15.914]  Sounds like maximum tyranny.
[02:03:17.695 --> 02:03:26.018]  And they've also come out and said that they want to go ahead and put the drones in our skies and want to change the rule because before they had to file a flight plan with the FAA.
[02:03:26.078 --> 02:03:31.381]  Now the government wants just carte blanche to have drones everywhere and anywhere with no record of where they're at.
[02:03:32.421 --> 02:03:36.023]  Big Baltimore Sun news story on that.
[02:03:36.303 --> 02:03:39.464]  And there's an article here out of the Salt Lake City
[02:03:40.544 --> 02:03:47.346]  Newspaper, out of the Salt Lake Tribune today, and it's on at fullwaters.net.
[02:03:47.466 --> 02:03:51.887]  Projects range from robots to electronic surveillance.
[02:03:53.088 --> 02:03:59.309]  When SAIC, it goes on, what does SAIC do?
[02:03:59.970 --> 02:04:05.791]  Science Application Internet Corporation has about 8,000 contracts, including 5,000 with the U.S.
[02:04:05.831 --> 02:04:06.191]  government.
[02:04:06.631 --> 02:04:08.372]  Here are just a few of the projects at any
[02:04:09.284 --> 02:04:10.265]  Army installation.
[02:04:10.385 --> 02:04:11.605]  This stuff is going on.
[02:04:11.625 --> 02:04:22.090]  At an army training center in Orlando, Florida, about 400 SAIC employees developed software that would help train law officers to respond to the release of chemical agent.
[02:04:23.431 --> 02:04:28.653]  At a concert in a nearby parking lot, employees train robots to sniff out explosives.
[02:04:29.694 --> 02:04:32.135]  Tube in San Diego suburb.
[02:04:33.283 --> 02:04:35.745]  Which happens to mean hidden in Spanish.
[02:04:35.845 --> 02:04:43.129]  Employees recently produced SAIC's 100 Gamma Ray Detection Machine, a device used along U.S.
[02:04:43.169 --> 02:04:46.411]  borders since 1990s to detect drugs and weapons.
[02:04:46.972 --> 02:04:58.459]  Steve Rockwood, who heads SAIC's research, hopes to develop remote surveillance machines that would, say, allow a port official in Los Angeles to peer inside a ship in Hong Kong.
[02:04:59.372 --> 02:05:02.854]  You notice they say, with that piece of technology, since the early 1990s.
[02:05:03.214 --> 02:05:22.647]  Yeah, that's when I first, in the mid-1990s, learned of these high-powered, ground-penetrating radar systems that can even be on a backpack and then fed into a scope on a .50 caliber gun.
[02:05:23.664 --> 02:05:30.150]  And it gives, this is the old technology, stuff that was declassified in the mid-1990s, looks right through your wall.
[02:05:30.190 --> 02:05:32.912]  It'll look through several feet, four feet of concrete.
[02:05:33.673 --> 02:05:36.355]  They have more high-powered units on police helicopters.
[02:05:36.375 --> 02:05:37.716]  They look right through your walls.
[02:05:38.076 --> 02:05:43.301]  On the news, they'll show you infrared that shows where footsteps were at, or what somebody did, or who's hiding under the bushes.
[02:05:43.361 --> 02:05:45.643]  No, this is, that's 1969 Vietnam stuff.
[02:05:48.201 --> 02:05:52.085]  This is the modern stuff, and they have it in color as well.
[02:05:52.145 --> 02:05:53.987]  That's now been declassified last year.
[02:05:54.787 --> 02:06:03.296]  Navy SEALs have got backpack units mounted to guns where they can look at you and then change the resonance, focus in on your beating heart.
[02:06:05.738 --> 02:06:07.219]  I mean, this is high-powered stuff.
[02:06:07.359 --> 02:06:08.060]  Now, in 1984, the helicopters
[02:06:12.252 --> 02:06:19.274]  The book opens with a dark blue helicopter flying around looking through people's windows and dialing into the telescreens.
[02:06:20.014 --> 02:06:30.578]  The helicopters by remote wireless can fly around and then look through your television set that's two-way, which they now are according to MSNBC.
[02:06:30.598 --> 02:06:33.619]  Your digital cable watches what you watch and has a microphone in it.
[02:06:34.539 --> 02:06:35.919]  All part of a free society, of course.
[02:06:35.959 --> 02:06:37.960]  Just massive insanity right in your face.
[02:06:39.594 --> 02:06:44.718]  And here it is, the 100th Gamma Ray Detection Machine, a device used along U.S.
[02:06:44.738 --> 02:06:45.278]  borders since the 1990s.
[02:06:45.499 --> 02:06:58.128]  Yeah, we have a video of this in Police State 3, where it shows a guy hiding in a car, crisp image of him through the metal, people hiding in a truck or drugs hidden in a truck.
[02:06:59.025 --> 02:07:03.247]  Inside multiple cases, looking right through the truck, right through the boxes, right into what's there.
[02:07:03.787 --> 02:07:05.268]  That's the old technology.
[02:07:05.308 --> 02:07:08.409]  Then it goes into other stuff that SAIC is developing.
[02:07:08.949 --> 02:07:22.615]  In several of SAIC's 400 offices, programmers are working on a $15 billion project with Boeing Company, built a network of high-tech tanks and surveillance drones for the Army's effort to become a faster, lighter, more lethal force.
[02:07:22.655 --> 02:07:24.996]  This is right out of Attack of the Clones, folks.
[02:07:25.717 --> 02:07:26.437]  We're good to go!
[02:07:51.136 --> 02:07:58.560]  With guns, rubber bullets, machine guns, cannons, microwave particle beams.
[02:08:00.281 --> 02:08:01.621]  It's remote controlled.
[02:08:01.701 --> 02:08:07.184]  Has also an AI chip so it can operate independently.
[02:08:07.224 --> 02:08:08.164]  You can put it in a zone.
[02:08:08.204 --> 02:08:10.305]  It'll go around killing everything.
[02:08:10.325 --> 02:08:14.287]  It has face scanning software loaded in it.
[02:08:14.347 --> 02:08:15.307]  It knows your face.
[02:08:15.327 --> 02:08:18.569]  It can go into a crowd and only kill you or kill those listed.
[02:08:19.241 --> 02:08:26.405]  They have many missiles that hone in on you according to your face, or according to your walk, or according to your speech pattern.
[02:08:28.126 --> 02:08:30.147]  Sounds like freedom, doesn't it?
[02:08:32.289 --> 02:08:33.289]  Drones.
[02:08:34.350 --> 02:08:36.111]  Flying around looking through your walls.
[02:08:36.191 --> 02:08:38.032]  Drones with microwave guns.
[02:08:39.113 --> 02:08:41.074]  Drones with radiation guns.
[02:08:44.156 --> 02:08:45.216]  They just fry ya.
[02:08:45.797 --> 02:09:02.982]  Again, in several of SAIC's 400 offices, programmers are working on a $15 billion project with Boeing Company, oh, your friendly remote control company, to build a network of high-tech tanks and surveillance drones for the Army's effort to become faster, lighter, and more lethal force.
[02:09:04.863 --> 02:09:11.725]  Lumbering tanks and armored troop carriers will be replaced by vehicles that, in some cases, would weigh less than a third as much as current models.
[02:09:13.166 --> 02:09:23.229]  In Fort Meade, SAIC is developing new methods of electronic surveillance under a $282 million contract with the National Security Agency.
[02:09:23.649 --> 02:09:24.789]  Many details are classified.
[02:09:24.809 --> 02:09:29.031]  The project is aimed at intercepting clues about possible impending terrorist attacks.
[02:09:29.071 --> 02:09:31.451]  You mean finding out if anybody's aware of what you're up to, government?
[02:09:32.072 --> 02:09:35.513]  From huge volumes of telephone conversations, email and other communications.
[02:09:35.533 --> 02:09:37.353]  That's 30 years old now they're announcing it.
[02:09:38.353 --> 02:09:40.474]  And that's the Salt Lake City Tribune for you.
[02:09:42.362 --> 02:09:44.684]  And a third as much as a tank?
[02:09:45.804 --> 02:10:07.499]  The thing in the newspaper last week that they showed, it showed 15, oh I don't know, 15, 20, a large group of Marines with their big armored shields, their police shields up in front of them, firing their guns, shotguns, M60s, machine guns, this massive, just firing at this tank and it's just rolling towards them.
[02:10:08.908 --> 02:10:13.912]  Then I went and read about the particular tank model, and again, microwave guns, everything to control you.
[02:10:13.932 --> 02:10:18.015]  I mean, come on, folks.
[02:10:18.295 --> 02:10:19.516]  Come on.
[02:10:20.977 --> 02:10:25.280]  And with systems like this, a handful of technocrats and the globalist employee can control it.
[02:10:25.761 --> 02:10:27.162]  Total compartmentalization.
[02:10:29.103 --> 02:10:31.745]  Here's another one out of the Herald Sun of Australia.
[02:10:32.405 --> 02:10:35.728]  The Solomon Islands are being invaded by the Australian government.
[02:10:36.565 --> 02:10:50.411]  Because of unrest, and it says the vanguard is drones, and says Prime Minister flees capital ahead of landing, and it says the Australian-led intervention force arrival, an official said today.
[02:10:51.804 --> 02:10:58.305]  And it goes on to say, meanwhile Australian forces will use unmanned spy planes for the first time during its campaign on the Solomons.
[02:10:58.365 --> 02:11:08.728]  Lots of campaigns in Africa and the Solomons and invasion forces and drone armies landing, many tanks rolling off.
[02:11:10.608 --> 02:11:10.748]  Oh!
[02:11:11.508 --> 02:11:11.848]  Freedom!
[02:11:13.329 --> 02:11:14.089]  Borders wide open.
[02:11:16.009 --> 02:11:17.069]  Sounds like freedom, huh?
[02:11:17.429 --> 02:11:18.770]  Smells like freedom, huh?
[02:11:19.270 --> 02:11:20.110]  Burning flesh.
[02:11:21.172 --> 02:11:28.856]  Rumsfeld says you asked to release photos of Saddam's sons, and now they've done it, and we've posted them on Infowars.net.
[02:11:29.976 --> 02:11:43.283]  Spencer here, Donald Rumsfeld, is releasing them, and he said it wouldn't be yesterday, but so it came out today, and I guess you agree, they look pretty fake.
[02:11:43.563 --> 02:11:45.944]  Mark, running the show, why don't you look them up?
[02:11:47.017 --> 02:11:49.519]  Why don't you go look at them and tell me if they look fake to you?
[02:11:49.659 --> 02:11:50.940]  Everybody's saying they look fake.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:57.485]  I predicted they'd be blurry and dark and... Oh, they're on ABC and a bunch of other sites.
[02:11:57.865 --> 02:12:00.587]  They're... I was just told they were posted on Infowars.net.
[02:12:00.647 --> 02:12:01.408]  Hit refresh on that.
[02:12:01.448 --> 02:12:02.008]  They should be there.
[02:12:02.749 --> 02:12:04.450]  But just go... I just want to get your opinion.
[02:12:04.490 --> 02:12:05.511]  I want your honest opinion.
[02:12:07.172 --> 02:12:10.214]  Uh, you know, a disheveled, bloody mass with a beard and a shaved head.
[02:12:10.234 --> 02:12:10.975]  Does that look, uh...
[02:12:11.812 --> 02:12:12.553]  That look real to you?
[02:12:12.573 --> 02:12:14.594]  Of course, they claim they killed him three other times.
[02:12:14.634 --> 02:12:16.055]  I mean, they claim they killed Chemical Ali.
[02:12:16.075 --> 02:12:17.436]  They were sure it was confirmed.
[02:12:17.456 --> 02:12:18.857]  They had his body.
[02:12:19.818 --> 02:12:20.858]  Chemical Ali.
[02:12:22.119 --> 02:12:27.583]  So, uh, the world awaits the pictures, and now they've... now they've got them.
[02:12:28.464 --> 02:12:33.887]  We're gonna break, and I'll come back with a situation with North Korea and Japan heating up, and Japan saying they're gonna arm with nuclear weapons.
[02:12:34.388 --> 02:12:35.969]  I told you four years ago they already have.
[02:12:37.293 --> 02:12:38.493]  That came out in Parliament.
[02:12:38.573 --> 02:12:43.135]  Also, Attorney General says church abuse scandal likely involved more than a thousand victims.
[02:12:43.155 --> 02:12:52.857]  People are all shocked by this, and I'm shocked by it, but when you read about big defense companies kidnapping 200,000 women and children in the Balkans alone in 2000, that's confirmed in court.
[02:12:53.918 --> 02:12:55.198]  I mean, it dwarfs this.
[02:12:55.278 --> 02:12:57.899]  Why isn't that on all the news stations?
[02:12:58.799 --> 02:13:01.600]  We'll talk about what the genetically modified crops are doing.
[02:13:02.839 --> 02:13:08.426]  Get into California Governor, a horrible gun-grabbing open borders traitor, who faces a recall vote.
[02:13:08.486 --> 02:13:09.127]  Wonderful news.
[02:13:09.167 --> 02:13:10.048]  That's now official.
[02:13:10.689 --> 02:13:11.450]  It's all coming up.

[02:15:13.966 --> 02:15:18.230]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[02:15:18.671 --> 02:15:23.215]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[02:15:23.596 --> 02:15:28.460]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[02:15:28.841 --> 02:15:30.622]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[02:15:30.662 --> 02:15:31.704]  can barely be read.
[02:15:31.984 --> 02:15:32.965]  It has faded that much.

[02:17:23.729 --> 02:17:34.531]  You know, isn't it interesting that the U.S.
[02:17:34.591 --> 02:17:50.855]  government told the media not to post the images of the dead Americans, the grisly photos, but they are posting the photos
[02:17:53.329 --> 02:17:57.471]  Of Saddam's supposed sons, if you believe that, who they claim they killed over and over again.
[02:17:57.491 --> 02:18:00.253]  They'll probably be saying they killed them again six months from now.
[02:18:00.313 --> 02:18:03.034]  People won't even remember they claim they killed them now.
[02:18:03.054 --> 02:18:06.836]  I mean, just over and over again, it's false reality, folks.
[02:18:08.078 --> 02:18:09.619]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:18:09.639 --> 02:18:14.302]  If you'd like to join us on air, it's 800-259-9231.
[02:18:15.303 --> 02:18:18.124]  That's 800-259-9231.
[02:18:19.605 --> 02:18:28.050]  We'd love to hear from you on any of the topics and issues that we have been covering here today.
[02:18:29.431 --> 02:18:35.875]  One of the big stories that's been unfolding over the last year and a half is Catholic Diocese.
[02:18:37.978 --> 02:18:46.564]  Religious organizations at the highest levels all over the US, Europe, Latin America.
[02:18:47.244 --> 02:18:53.348]  It's the norm, not the exception, brutally molesting small children.
[02:18:55.229 --> 02:19:01.393]  And it makes my stomach turn, and I don't like covering these issues on the air, and it's so prolific.
[02:19:02.975 --> 02:19:05.997]  And this is out of the Boston Globe.
[02:19:06.077 --> 02:19:08.398]  I have another one here out of the Associated Press.
[02:19:08.439 --> 02:19:10.080]  In fact, that's the story I'll cover here.
[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:11.801]  It's a little bit more detailed.
[02:19:11.821 --> 02:19:18.245]  I'm sure you've already heard about this, but the Attorney General says it borders on the unbelievable.
[02:19:18.285 --> 02:19:20.306]  That's the Attorney General of the state of Massachusetts.
[02:19:20.946 --> 02:19:26.190]  Attorney General says church abuse scandal likely involved more than 1,000 victims.
[02:19:26.210 --> 02:19:27.691]  They've already found and confirmed over 750.
[02:19:30.481 --> 02:19:46.828]  The Associated Press reports over six decades likely more than 1,000 people were molested by Roman Catholic priests and church workers while leaders in the Boston Archdiocese engaged in a massive inexcusable failure to do anything about it.
[02:19:47.288 --> 02:19:53.191]  The Massachusetts Attorney General said in a report Wednesday that outlines the results of a lengthy criminal investigation.
[02:19:54.692 --> 02:19:59.934]  And so they're just as guilty or more guilty than the scumbag perverts that need to be executed.
[02:20:02.131 --> 02:20:16.715]  So this is the type of society, but we've had guests on, it's been in the news, I mean in France they catch the elite in the government involved, in Belgium, in the UK, in the Netherlands, the Dutch royal family's been caught with dead bodies of kids on their land.
[02:20:17.775 --> 02:20:25.297]  Again, DynCorp and the UN, the employees went public, got fired, they sued, won, it came out, DynCorp and the UN flew out 200,000 women and children, I mean 200,000?! !
[02:20:28.593 --> 02:20:30.774]  This is all just off-the-charts crazy!
[02:20:30.954 --> 02:20:32.615]  I can't even believe it, but it's admitted!
[02:20:34.075 --> 02:20:36.396]  So they're focusing in, and I'm not a Catholic, folks.
[02:20:37.117 --> 02:20:38.297]  I'm not defending the Catholics.
[02:20:38.357 --> 02:20:42.779]  What I'm saying here is they're over here focusing in on the Catholics, and a thousand!
[02:20:42.799 --> 02:20:43.779]  I mean, this is horrible!
[02:20:44.320 --> 02:20:45.980]  This is just in Boston!
[02:20:47.261 --> 02:20:48.942]  This is just in Massachusetts!
[02:20:49.002 --> 02:20:50.082]  A thousand!
[02:20:50.722 --> 02:20:51.923]  They say it could be higher.
[02:20:51.963 --> 02:20:53.503]  This is yesterday's news.
[02:20:53.563 --> 02:20:54.484]  Now there's more!
[02:20:56.934 --> 02:20:58.676]  And these priests are having to admit it!
[02:21:00.797 --> 02:21:10.246]  And massive cover-ups, and you've got these bishops, you know, who are covering stuff up, and the next day they're running somebody over in a hit-and-run, and stumbling around drunk.
[02:21:10.326 --> 02:21:11.727]  I mean, it's just pure evil!
[02:21:12.988 --> 02:21:14.109]  But it's all over the place.
[02:21:14.169 --> 02:21:16.751]  I mean, I've had Senator DeCamp on, respected Republican.
[02:21:17.392 --> 02:21:19.994]  Found out the Republican Party was running it in Nebraska.
[02:21:20.274 --> 02:21:21.856]  Booked in in Northern California.
[02:21:24.562 --> 02:21:27.284]  Folks, that's where most the kids go to get kidnapped.
[02:21:27.384 --> 02:21:33.108]  They go bye-bye to Saudi Arabia, and bye-bye to Israel, and bye-bye to Bangladesh and Thailand.
[02:21:34.769 --> 02:21:38.651]  I met with one of the former investigators for Interpol on this show.
[02:21:38.691 --> 02:21:42.374]  His book is published by Penguin, one of the biggest publishers.
[02:21:42.434 --> 02:21:43.394]  It's documented!
[02:21:45.496 --> 02:21:47.357]  This stuff is all, folks,
[02:21:48.456 --> 02:21:49.757]  It's all over the place.
[02:21:49.897 --> 02:21:51.238]  It is totally evil.
[02:21:51.338 --> 02:21:54.439]  It makes me sick and angry.
[02:21:54.900 --> 02:21:57.461]  And my friends, I'm so sick of reporting on it.
[02:21:57.961 --> 02:21:59.222]  I'm so sick of covering it.
[02:21:59.802 --> 02:22:03.965]  About half the time, I don't even mention the news that we post on the website.
[02:22:04.625 --> 02:22:05.225]  I look at it.
[02:22:05.285 --> 02:22:06.646]  I just can't.
[02:22:07.807 --> 02:22:08.827]  It is overwhelming.
[02:22:08.927 --> 02:22:09.788]  It is so evil.
[02:22:10.048 --> 02:22:11.949]  I don't want to talk about 9-1-1 anymore.
[02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:13.970]  They carried out 9-1-1.
[02:22:16.271 --> 02:22:17.092]  They're pure evil!
[02:22:17.759 --> 02:22:20.580]  I'm tired of focusing on it, but we have to to save our families.
[02:22:20.881 --> 02:22:24.382]  These people are right out of the pit of Hades.
[02:22:24.682 --> 02:22:26.883]  Right out of the crack of doom.
[02:22:27.464 --> 02:22:32.046]  That's why they're in positions of power, because they're ruthless sadists who enjoy power.
[02:22:32.486 --> 02:22:35.567]  Smart psychopaths get into government.
[02:22:35.607 --> 02:22:36.848]  They wear uniforms.
[02:22:37.548 --> 02:22:39.169]  They have insignias of rank.
[02:22:40.351 --> 02:22:45.012]  Uh, they have the scepters of power to carry out their wickedness.
[02:22:45.092 --> 02:22:46.372]  It's happened throughout history.
[02:22:46.472 --> 02:22:47.632]  It's happening again.
[02:22:48.032 --> 02:22:49.273]  Mayday alert!
[02:22:49.713 --> 02:22:59.174]  We are under total attack at every level by psychotic, control freak elites that control every form of crime imaginable!
[02:22:59.734 --> 02:23:02.555]  And I am begging you to wake up now!
[02:23:05.215 --> 02:23:06.136]  We're on the march.
[02:23:06.616 --> 02:23:08.136]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:11.934]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:15.415 --> 02:23:17.236]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:23:17.396 --> 02:23:17.996]  I mean, real.
[02:23:18.196 --> 02:23:23.038]  Hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:23:23.358 --> 02:23:24.218]  Probably never, right?
[02:23:24.478 --> 02:23:28.000]  Hey folks, Michael Trudell here, and I want to tell you... Dietary supplement.

[02:23:44.239 --> 02:23:47.059]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:48.220 --> 02:23:50.120]  Alright, more vital news and information.
[02:23:50.160 --> 02:23:51.981]  Your call is coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:23:52.001 --> 02:23:55.741]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[02:23:55.761 --> 02:23:58.742]  And the website to visit is infowars.net.
[02:23:58.782 --> 02:24:01.683]  That's the site we updated today.
[02:24:07.831 --> 02:24:11.273]  That's the site that's done under Department of Defense hack attack and it's official folks.
[02:24:11.293 --> 02:24:12.474]  I don't talk about it on the air.
[02:24:12.514 --> 02:24:21.578]  It's happened a lot and they're getting more sophisticated and multifaceted and the diagnostics have been done and it's a wholesale massive attack of the largest proportions we've ever seen.
[02:24:21.598 --> 02:24:25.340]  So InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are down.
[02:24:25.360 --> 02:24:26.761]  They'll be back up.
[02:24:26.881 --> 02:24:34.165]  Usually they're down just a few minutes when this happens and now I'm just going to start about 5, 10, I don't know, 20 other websites if you support us.
[02:24:34.953 --> 02:24:39.154]  And, uh, we'll just have servers everywhere, and you'll just have a long list of websites to visit.
[02:24:40.094 --> 02:24:41.314]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:24:41.914 --> 02:24:43.255]  Infowars.net, though.
[02:24:44.415 --> 02:24:50.376]  Uh, but, uh, we've got the photos of the Saddam's so-called sons that they claim they killed three other times.
[02:24:50.396 --> 02:24:57.817]  They've got these photos that look incredibly fake-up, as we predicted, dark and blurred and everything else.
[02:24:57.877 --> 02:25:00.178]  You'd believe anything from the Globalists are crazy.
[02:25:01.221 --> 02:25:08.643]  Earlier I talked about a thousand victims abused by the Archdiocese there in Massachusetts.
[02:25:09.643 --> 02:25:11.703]  And this is going on all over the country and all over the world.
[02:25:11.883 --> 02:25:12.523]  And it's horrible.
[02:25:12.563 --> 02:25:13.283]  And it's massive.
[02:25:13.684 --> 02:25:16.724]  And the Attorney General said it's hard to believe, but it's confirmed.
[02:25:16.804 --> 02:25:18.965]  Well, and that's the Attorney General in Mass.
[02:25:20.365 --> 02:25:24.506]  Well, folks, I mean, we had Senator DeCamp on this show six, seven years ago.
[02:25:24.526 --> 02:25:25.866]  We've had him on many times since then.
[02:25:25.886 --> 02:25:27.186]  We've had him on about twice a year.
[02:25:28.747 --> 02:25:30.727]  He's probably been on the show, I don't know, ten, fifteen times.
[02:25:33.032 --> 02:25:41.379]  Senator DeCamp was the head of the Republican Party and then was one of the leaders of the Senate there in the state, got out of it.
[02:25:42.519 --> 02:25:43.420]  Private business.
[02:25:44.181 --> 02:25:45.622]  He got a call.
[02:25:45.682 --> 02:25:54.809]  They said there's this big story that's hurting the Republican Party of all this stuff that got found at the savings and loan with some of the top Republicans in the state.
[02:25:55.583 --> 02:25:57.284]  Can you go disprove this for us?
[02:25:57.344 --> 02:25:59.665]  He went and investigated it, found out it was all true.
[02:26:00.106 --> 02:26:02.927]  Stuff I will not mention on the air, I've let DeCamp tell the story.
[02:26:03.548 --> 02:26:07.110]  He had the police reports, the files, the documents, the diaries, the witnesses.
[02:26:08.571 --> 02:26:14.334]  The government came in, the FBI grabbed all the videos and ended the investigation and said national security.
[02:26:16.255 --> 02:26:22.359]  The kids independently, separately talked about a place in Northern California they were taken with tall redwoods and a stone owl.
[02:26:23.747 --> 02:26:27.250]  And then we have the other reports outside of his report of what goes on there.
[02:26:27.270 --> 02:26:52.710]  And then he just testified last year in open federal court in Nebraska about the case of Boys Town, the big Catholic famous orphanage, and how they were flying the kids out to parties in Dallas and other areas with top Republicans and unspeakable things being done to the poor children.
[02:26:55.351 --> 02:26:56.992]  But again, it's part of national security.
[02:26:57.012 --> 02:26:59.533]  You try to stop the abuse of children, I guess you're with Al-Qaeda now.
[02:26:59.653 --> 02:27:00.733]  That's kind of the mindset.
[02:27:02.034 --> 02:27:04.014]  But see, it's so horrible, people can't believe it.
[02:27:04.915 --> 02:27:16.959]  And he exposed on this show years ago what the Catholic Church was doing, how it was being protected, how it had been taken over by these pedophile rings on the show, how good Catholics tried to blow the whistle and were punished.
[02:27:17.708 --> 02:27:23.731]  A lot of people got killed who were involved in this investigation, including the Senate's investigator, paid investigator.
[02:27:24.211 --> 02:27:28.573]  He called the camp and said, I've got the proof at the highest levels of who's behind it.
[02:27:28.613 --> 02:27:30.574]  I'm flying in from Chicago.
[02:27:30.674 --> 02:27:32.395]  Right now, I'm getting on my own plane.
[02:27:32.655 --> 02:27:38.698]  The plane blew up, was strewn over a mile with his son, by the way, on board with him.
[02:27:40.199 --> 02:27:46.242]  And then you see this, but I'm telling you, this stuff with the Catholic Church is not one micron
[02:27:48.130 --> 02:27:54.174]  It is not one one thousandth over the decades of what's really going on.
[02:27:54.254 --> 02:27:59.317]  I mean one case of the UN and DynCorp, the mercenary forces.
[02:28:00.458 --> 02:28:02.699]  One case admitted in court.
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:05.201]  They lost the lawsuit.
[02:28:05.781 --> 02:28:07.482]  It was a UN employee, a DynCorp employee.
[02:28:07.502 --> 02:28:11.985]  They said we're not going to be part of loading kids and women on planes and flying them out of the country.
[02:28:12.285 --> 02:28:15.227]  Two hundred thousand.
[02:28:17.941 --> 02:28:19.923]  They got fired, they sued, it all came out in court.
[02:28:19.943 --> 02:28:21.945]  It was in the BBC and a few other papers last year.
[02:28:22.306 --> 02:28:25.669]  We have a subsection on that on the websites that are down right now, unfortunately.
[02:28:27.231 --> 02:28:30.374]  Government slaverings is the link.
[02:28:31.255 --> 02:28:38.262]  We got the UN caught in dozens of countries and the government and officials and British and Dutch officials and all of it right there.
[02:28:39.213 --> 02:28:43.537]  German judges caught in slave pens with murdered kids hanging up.
[02:28:43.837 --> 02:28:49.302]  I mean, it makes Jason and Freddy Krueger look like loving individuals!
[02:28:52.645 --> 02:28:54.867]  And somebody's got to stand up for the children, folks.
[02:28:55.147 --> 02:28:56.448]  Somebody has got to do it.
[02:28:56.528 --> 02:28:57.749]  Somebody's got to have courage.
[02:28:57.809 --> 02:28:59.090]  Somebody's got to speak out.
[02:28:59.251 --> 02:29:02.734]  And you've got to face the horror of how bad things have gotten.
[02:29:02.774 --> 02:29:03.514]  You've got to do it.
[02:29:03.534 --> 02:29:04.155]  You've got to do it now.
[02:29:05.276 --> 02:29:11.557]  For this thousand victims in Boston area alone is the tip of the iceberg.
[02:29:12.238 --> 02:29:12.918]  Literally.
[02:29:15.058 --> 02:29:20.499]  And they focus in on this frankly as a distraction from the organized governmental trade.
[02:29:24.220 --> 02:29:25.180]  Watch out folks.
[02:29:25.280 --> 02:29:26.260]  Just watch out.
[02:29:28.341 --> 02:29:28.741]  Alright.
[02:29:29.561 --> 02:29:30.881]  And the media's in on it too.
[02:29:30.921 --> 02:29:33.062]  If your kid gets grabbed by guys in a white van
[02:29:34.429 --> 02:29:34.629]  Hi, Alex.
[02:30:04.594 --> 02:30:06.035]  Glad to finally get on the air.
[02:30:06.395 --> 02:30:09.978]  Listen, I have some stuff that I want to ask you about.
[02:30:10.118 --> 02:30:12.259]  About some other websites that are out there.
[02:30:12.279 --> 02:30:14.521]  I'm sure you're familiar with From the Wilderness.
[02:30:15.361 --> 02:30:15.922]  Yes, I am.
[02:30:18.403 --> 02:30:21.886]  And have you gotten a chance to read the full page ad they've got out?
[02:30:23.087 --> 02:30:24.708]  I do not support Mike Rupert.
[02:30:25.368 --> 02:30:25.788]  Oh, really?
[02:30:25.908 --> 02:30:27.930]  And that's all I'm going to say and that's where I'm going to leave it.
[02:30:28.070 --> 02:30:29.671]  I think that he's done some good work.
[02:30:29.731 --> 02:30:30.932]  I've had him on this show probably
[02:30:32.464 --> 02:30:40.909]  Probably, I don't know, 18, 20, it's in the high teens, and I just have no comments about Mr. Riverd.
[02:30:40.929 --> 02:30:41.790]  That's all I can say.
[02:30:41.930 --> 02:30:42.790]  That's all I will say.
[02:30:43.811 --> 02:30:45.492]  Okay, and can I ask you about something else?
[02:30:45.932 --> 02:30:46.553]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:30:47.693 --> 02:30:50.795]  Alright, I was watching something.
[02:30:50.835 --> 02:30:57.299]  I'm here in Austin, so I see all the public access stuff that goes on, and I saw something the other day.
[02:30:57.319 --> 02:30:58.500]  It was a speech that
[02:31:00.768 --> 02:31:07.232]  I don't even remember who was giving it, but he talked about how no nations are actually nations.
[02:31:07.272 --> 02:31:17.539]  They're really corporations, and everything runs under International Maritime Admiralty, and birth certificates in the U.S.
[02:31:17.679 --> 02:31:19.941]  are actually worth $630,000 to the U.S.
[02:31:21.442 --> 02:31:21.822]  government.
[02:31:22.883 --> 02:31:24.524]  Now, that's true.
[02:31:24.544 --> 02:31:25.345]  This is all admitted.
[02:31:25.885 --> 02:31:27.206]  We're traded as collateral.
[02:31:28.642 --> 02:31:56.008]  On debt, and they admit this in deals with the third world, we posted three or four times the last month, people keep requesting it, the official State Department document from 1991, detailing a declassified plan since 1974, with Kissinger and others, 73 excuse me, that if third world countries want money, IMF World Bank loans,
[02:31:57.327 --> 02:32:05.753]  They have to sign their people over as collateral and they have to sterilize, forcibly, half the women in those 10 countries.
[02:32:05.813 --> 02:32:10.316]  So, we don't just have the facts that we're traded like cattle on the open market.
[02:32:10.336 --> 02:32:15.960]  We have official government documents from the State Department websites, Library of Congress, where
[02:32:16.818 --> 02:32:29.763]  They also direct governments of programs of dumbing us down, of vaccinating us, of sterilizing us, that have to be carried out against us if the governments are going to get their funds.
[02:32:32.264 --> 02:32:42.328]  And I remember old-timers, you know, eight years ago talking about the maritime and that's how it really ran in the courts, and then now there have been cases like Diana Luppi, the famous screenwriter out in, it was in
[02:32:44.325 --> 02:32:48.207]  The New American Magazine Big Report was also in the Associated Press three years ago.
[02:32:49.087 --> 02:32:55.949]  She owned 90-something acres and a beautiful three-story house on private land with public land around it.
[02:32:56.250 --> 02:33:07.934]  The house was homesteaded to 1906, and they went and closed public roads that on the maps were not even part of the Forest Service, did not cross Forest Service lands, but on three sides it was Forest Service lands.
[02:33:08.641 --> 02:33:20.804]  They came to her house, grabbed her, wouldn't let her have her stuff, arrested her, said, you can't have a jury, we're taking your house, no warrants, no judge, and she went before the judge and he said, this is maritime, we have seized your land under admiralty.
[02:33:21.925 --> 02:33:24.585]  And that was in the federal ruling.
[02:33:25.026 --> 02:33:26.866]  And there's many of those, but now they say it.
[02:33:27.686 --> 02:33:37.149]  And under admiralty, they are a private corporation authorizing themselves to engage in seizure of any vessel not flying the Jolly Roger.
[02:33:38.466 --> 02:33:40.847]  And that sounds ridiculous, but that's what Skull and Bones is.
[02:33:40.867 --> 02:33:42.588]  It's a cult of the Skull and Bones.
[02:33:43.128 --> 02:33:44.389]  And on the wall they have war.
[02:33:44.469 --> 02:33:46.110]  They say we are the Pirate Kings.
[02:33:46.830 --> 02:33:50.372]  And it's a society of piracy and wickedness and criminality.
[02:33:51.132 --> 02:33:53.453]  And they have set themselves up as the government.
[02:33:54.154 --> 02:34:00.777]  And everyone is free game unless they are in the criminal crime syndicate and openly fly the Jolly Roger.
[02:34:00.797 --> 02:34:03.818]  That's some pretty scary stuff.
[02:34:03.918 --> 02:34:05.659]  I guess the last thing I want to say is
[02:34:06.536 --> 02:34:10.657]  Maybe we should investigate about a third of the Germans if they're involved in Al Qaeda.
[02:34:10.897 --> 02:34:12.518]  And I much appreciate your work, Alex.
[02:34:12.558 --> 02:34:12.858]  Thanks.
[02:34:13.638 --> 02:34:14.138]  Thank you.
[02:34:14.478 --> 02:34:15.899]  And that's the Reuters report.
[02:34:18.140 --> 02:34:21.561]  68% think the government is covering it up and was involved.
[02:34:21.581 --> 02:34:24.321]  30% think the government did it.
[02:34:25.882 --> 02:34:28.823]  And that is on Infowars.net right now.
[02:34:28.863 --> 02:34:30.223]  That's Roy Terz.
[02:34:30.303 --> 02:34:31.323]  Let me say it again.
[02:34:31.484 --> 02:34:32.424]  Roy Terz.
[02:34:33.624 --> 02:34:36.285]  More of your calls coming up here in a moment.
[02:34:38.513 --> 02:34:42.436]  And the poll free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[02:34:42.576 --> 02:34:46.960]  And I'll get to those calls here in just a second.
[02:34:48.241 --> 02:34:53.244]  I know that sounds crazy, but look, the Nazis, the Skull and Bones, Skull and Bones Society is the Skull and Bones.
[02:34:54.685 --> 02:34:59.129]  A lot of the intelligence agency symbol is the Skull and Bones, Special Forces, Skull and Bones.
[02:35:00.132 --> 02:35:03.414]  And what it means is, if you're not in the click, that's what the British were.
[02:35:03.454 --> 02:35:07.796]  You scratch a Brit, you find a pirate.
[02:35:07.916 --> 02:35:11.799]  Or, why did God never let the sun set on the British Empire?
[02:35:12.899 --> 02:35:15.581]  Because God wouldn't trust an Englishman in the dark.
[02:35:17.562 --> 02:35:22.144]  Folks, my name's Jones, so I'm not saying that people that are from England are bad, okay?
[02:35:23.145 --> 02:35:28.548]  But what I'm saying is that a very sinister, intelligent empire
[02:35:30.228 --> 02:35:58.067]  Has been based there all along and in the subterfuge and the wars with the Dutch and the French and then later the Germans and the Portuguese and of course earlier the Spanish and the Portuguese in the espionage, I mean the tricks, the manipulations, you know the British would blow up their own ships and say the French did it as an excuse to invade and the French would blow up one of their ships and say the English did it.
[02:35:58.087 --> 02:35:58.848]  It's the same trick.
[02:35:59.545 --> 02:36:02.027]  And the British were the ones that flew the Jolly Roger.
[02:36:02.608 --> 02:36:11.596]  People really don't know that, and then later, some of their captains would break away and start their own crime syndicates in the Caribbean and in the Mediterranean, and that's why you get the Jolly Roger.
[02:36:11.636 --> 02:36:24.888]  But British ships, when they were flying that, were authorized, they had other pendants and flags, were authorized to feed on everyone and anyone, even British ships.
[02:36:25.638 --> 02:36:28.160]  When the Crown needed money, they would say, Attack!
[02:36:28.220 --> 02:36:28.600]  Attack!
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:29.221]  Admiralty!
[02:36:29.341 --> 02:36:29.841]  Admiralty!
[02:36:30.301 --> 02:36:35.245]  And it was just giant ships everywhere, just attacking and stealing and murdering.
[02:36:36.005 --> 02:36:47.373]  And the French did it to a certain degree, so did the Dutch, and the Portuguese and the Spanish, but the British were the best, and the smartest, and they ended up dominating everything.
[02:36:48.654 --> 02:36:53.037]  And so, that's where all this skull-and-bone stuff with the Nazis and the Bushes and
[02:36:54.491 --> 02:36:57.613]  That's where all of it comes from, and that's what maritime and admiralty is.
[02:36:57.653 --> 02:37:08.880]  I mean, the captain had so much power on a British ship that if you didn't swab the deck properly, and they would just routinely do this just to maintain order, they said, they would keelhaul you.
[02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:12.642]  You ever seen the barnacles that grow on the bottom of an ocean-going ship?
[02:37:14.283 --> 02:37:15.184]  Razor blades.
[02:37:15.304 --> 02:37:18.025]  And about 80% of the time, you would die.
[02:37:18.105 --> 02:37:23.889]  They would tie you to a rope and drag you from side to side for about two minutes underwater
[02:37:25.057 --> 02:37:32.924]  And then haul you up with lacerations everywhere, and if you survive, well, that was your punishment.
[02:37:36.948 --> 02:37:39.110]  Admiralty is godlike power.
[02:37:40.411 --> 02:37:41.913]  It's total dictatorship.
[02:37:43.613 --> 02:37:55.616]  And so, when they haul a woman in and say, we want your house, and she goes, I get a jury, I get a whatever, they throw her in jail, take her back out, and she goes, she goes, I get a redress of grievances, and they say, this is Admiralty!
[02:37:58.196 --> 02:38:01.437]  This is an Admiralty Maritime Court!
[02:38:03.077 --> 02:38:05.158]  This is martial law!
[02:38:07.088 --> 02:38:09.629]  And so they're flying the Jolly Roger, the war flag.
[02:38:10.029 --> 02:38:15.250]  That's with that gold fringe in the classrooms and the city council buildings and in all the courts.
[02:38:16.250 --> 02:38:17.590]  It's not a decorative flag.
[02:38:17.991 --> 02:38:19.631]  That means something according to U.S.
[02:38:19.671 --> 02:38:19.951]  Code.
[02:38:19.991 --> 02:38:21.952]  That is a military court.
[02:38:23.112 --> 02:38:24.232]  And the judges know that.
[02:38:26.673 --> 02:38:32.654]  So this is the new freedom of getting rid of posse commentatus and putting troops on the streets and having the hover drones in the skies.
[02:38:34.855 --> 02:38:36.495]  This is government throughout history
[02:38:37.398 --> 02:38:39.940]  It's setting itself up as the power elite.
[02:38:40.621 --> 02:38:44.964]  Setting itself up and saying, I am the boss.
[02:38:46.165 --> 02:38:47.887]  You are my slave.
[02:38:48.668 --> 02:38:51.510]  And early in dictatorships, it's always for your own good.
[02:38:52.010 --> 02:38:58.696]  As they get more and more arrogant, it then becomes hero worship of the great leader, like North Korea, and oh, we're so lucky we have you.
[02:38:59.296 --> 02:39:00.578]  And now it's entering into that.
[02:39:02.779 --> 02:39:04.441]  So it's a replay of the same business.
[02:39:05.242 --> 02:39:11.345]  And there's so many admitted historical accounts where the British would blow up their own ships and blame it on people.
[02:39:11.385 --> 02:39:12.546]  I mean, 300 years ago.
[02:39:14.447 --> 02:39:22.151]  And the Germans attacked their own troops and killed men in a radio station to start the war with the Poles.
[02:39:23.772 --> 02:39:25.373]  Gulf of Tonkin never occurred.
[02:39:25.953 --> 02:39:27.834]  These are all admitted things.
[02:39:29.735 --> 02:39:31.256]  And we can sit there and be naive.
[02:39:31.336 --> 02:39:34.598]  Okay, well, they're going to practice admiralty against you.
[02:39:36.866 --> 02:39:45.132]  When the IRS, without a judge, a jury, without even charging you, you wake up one day and your bank account's been seized.
[02:39:46.313 --> 02:39:47.414]  No jury, no nothing.
[02:39:47.494 --> 02:39:49.455]  See, you thought you were in a free society.
[02:39:49.495 --> 02:39:50.956]  That's Admiralty.
[02:39:53.778 --> 02:39:59.923]  When, in China, when tanks run over demonstrators in Tiananmen Square, that's Admiralty.
[02:40:01.844 --> 02:40:04.086]  That's Dictatorship.
[02:40:05.234 --> 02:40:07.836]  That's king rat, strong man.
[02:40:09.377 --> 02:40:13.100]  Slavery, serfdom, feudalism, captivity.
[02:40:14.461 --> 02:40:23.749]  You're being free-booted by a powerful, intelligent society of sadists that enjoy feeding on you or they couldn't live with a conscience.
[02:40:23.769 --> 02:40:29.093]  I mean, who out there could do all these crimes and be a good person?
[02:40:29.133 --> 02:40:29.473]  You couldn't.
[02:40:29.493 --> 02:40:30.534]  It's by their very nature.
[02:40:32.262 --> 02:40:35.224]  They're feeding on us en masse, and it's a big joke.
[02:40:37.346 --> 02:40:44.451]  And they've got these high-powered spin machines and PR firms and advertising and pitchmen selling you the fraud.
[02:40:44.471 --> 02:40:56.879]  I mean, we've got the documents from Homeland Security, the Defense Department, and the Fortune 500 meeting with MIT and the RFID Center of how to sell it to you, how to neutralize opposition, how to put it in a cashless control grid.
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:40:57.720]  It's here!
[02:40:57.800 --> 02:40:58.421]  They're saying it!
[02:40:58.461 --> 02:40:58.961]  It's public!
[02:40:59.161 --> 02:41:00.202]  We got the documents!
[02:41:00.242 --> 02:41:01.623]  It's been in the Associated Press!
[02:41:02.868 --> 02:41:05.950]  Massive slave grids being built for you!
[02:41:06.311 --> 02:41:07.972]  Huge prisons everywhere!
[02:41:08.512 --> 02:41:09.353]  Gun grabbing!
[02:41:09.593 --> 02:41:17.239]  Police in black ski masks wearing skull patches and cobra patches and black widow patches wearing the regalia of pirates!
[02:41:18.897 --> 02:41:19.738]  In your face!
[02:41:19.979 --> 02:41:21.601]  Evil manifesting!
[02:41:21.821 --> 02:41:26.467]  You know the bad guys in Lord of the Rings wear black masks and black uniforms.
[02:41:26.868 --> 02:41:29.772]  That's what the devil's troops wear!
[02:41:30.072 --> 02:41:31.154]  And it's in your face!
[02:41:31.474 --> 02:41:35.059]  And you can't recognize a ringwraith when you see one.
[02:41:37.248 --> 02:41:44.636]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:44.896 --> 02:41:49.641]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:49.862 --> 02:41:55.508]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:55.748 --> 02:42:00.271]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:42:00.492 --> 02:42:07.657]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:42:07.677 --> 02:42:11.920]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:14.903]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[02:42:15.103 --> 02:42:21.869]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:42:35.945 --> 02:42:39.427]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:42:39.687 --> 02:42:43.189]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:42:43.289 --> 02:42:47.231]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:42:47.451 --> 02:42:53.614]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:42:54.015 --> 02:43:01.939]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:43:02.339 --> 02:43:07.682]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[02:43:07.842 --> 02:43:11.604]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:43:11.984 --> 02:43:13.825]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[02:43:13.905 --> 02:43:16.067]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:43:16.307 --> 02:43:21.249]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.

[02:44:45.145 --> 02:44:48.706]  They're calmly on the news saying we all need implantable microchips.
[02:44:48.726 --> 02:44:51.267]  They're admitting hover drones are going to look through our walls.
[02:44:51.327 --> 02:44:53.068]  The police are in black ski masks.
[02:44:54.408 --> 02:44:55.628]  The borders are wide open.
[02:44:55.648 --> 02:44:57.849]  They're saying race for more terrorist attacks.
[02:44:58.669 --> 02:44:59.969]  Isn't it obvious?
[02:45:00.850 --> 02:45:01.970]  There is some good news though.
[02:45:03.055 --> 02:45:08.117]  A federal judge ruled they have to throw out a gun ban suit by the NAACP in New York.
[02:45:09.677 --> 02:45:13.918]  The House has voted to take out one provision of the USA Patriot Act.
[02:45:15.879 --> 02:45:22.101]  California Governor Gray Davis will face recall vote, but he's vowing to fight it.
[02:45:23.095 --> 02:45:29.982]  Democrat Gray Davis will have to fight to keep his job this fall in the nation's first gubernatorial recall election in 82 years.
[02:45:30.482 --> 02:45:40.652]  State officials announced Wednesday after tallying the results of a Republican-led petition to drive what seemed far-fetched just a month ago.
[02:45:41.753 --> 02:45:46.037]  Again, results of a Republican-led petition drive that seemed far-fetched just months ago.
[02:45:47.757 --> 02:46:01.043]  Kevin Shelley said in a news conference that the counties have reported 1.3 million valid petition signatures, well more than the 897,000 required for the recall to make it on the ballot.
[02:46:01.323 --> 02:46:08.706]  Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante was expected Thursday to schedule an election, which could be held as early as September 23rd.
[02:46:08.886 --> 02:46:13.008]  And again, Davis is a gun grabber.
[02:46:13.706 --> 02:46:15.588]  Who's involved in energy manipulations.
[02:46:15.628 --> 02:46:16.709]  He is something else.
[02:46:17.330 --> 02:46:20.614]  And I hope that a real conservative candidate wins and not a neocon.
[02:46:20.654 --> 02:46:25.579]  But that shows how sick the people are of these type of activities.
[02:46:25.639 --> 02:46:29.524]  But Davis is of course racing to put all the touch screens in to stop that.
[02:46:30.791 --> 02:46:33.712]  100-day countdown to China's first astronaut.
[02:46:33.752 --> 02:46:35.253]  This is from the new scientist.
[02:46:35.653 --> 02:46:45.197]  China is on course to become only the third nation ever to place a human in space following press reports that the first crewed flight will take place in 100 days.
[02:46:45.677 --> 02:46:47.818]  Government source told the state-controlled news service.
[02:46:48.621 --> 02:46:56.888]  When we know that the launch would take place within this time frame, no official date for launch, has been set.
[02:46:57.209 --> 02:46:58.270]  A secret crew.
[02:46:58.710 --> 02:47:03.034]  So far, China has successfully launched four uncrewed spacecraft.
[02:47:03.434 --> 02:47:07.698]  The last of these blasted off January 2003 and was fitted with a human life support system.
[02:47:08.098 --> 02:47:11.341]  The size of the crew planned for the first flight remains a secret.
[02:47:11.361 --> 02:47:15.605]  But thanks to Clinton and the neocons, they transferred them the systems to do this.
[02:47:16.866 --> 02:47:20.167]  That's real smart, but they want to track and trace and control your life.
[02:47:21.587 --> 02:47:27.349]  Also, there's a bunch of reports coming out confirming the BBC has their interviews with the murdered.
[02:47:27.369 --> 02:47:28.950]  They want to say suicide, but no evidence.
[02:47:28.970 --> 02:47:29.730]  I'll say murdered.
[02:47:30.050 --> 02:47:31.210]  That's for all the evidence points.
[02:47:32.451 --> 02:47:36.872]  The murdered microbiologist, former head of Porton Down, the guy that blew the whistle on Blair.
[02:47:38.233 --> 02:47:45.835]  They've got tapes of it and are about to release it, and every word they put in print or on the news, they say, they have on tape with David Kelly.
[02:47:47.702 --> 02:47:48.322]  Here's another one.
[02:47:48.362 --> 02:47:52.203]  Police call for total ban on replica guns in New York.
[02:47:52.283 --> 02:47:53.003]  Another story.
[02:47:53.063 --> 02:47:55.784]  DCA shoots down paintball guns.
[02:47:55.904 --> 02:48:06.527]  Sports Authority fined $20,000 and it turns out that some of the stores were selling paintball guns and that's not allowed here in the free country.
[02:48:08.467 --> 02:48:10.948]  So that's the major move there.
[02:48:12.111 --> 02:48:14.152]  No, just a bunch of other news.
[02:48:14.912 --> 02:48:15.172]  U.S.
[02:48:15.232 --> 02:48:17.673]  House rejects higher media ownership limits.
[02:48:18.614 --> 02:48:23.035]  They cannot own unlimited amounts of media, and that is a good thing.
[02:48:23.055 --> 02:48:24.236]  We need alternative media.
[02:48:24.896 --> 02:48:26.457]  The airwaves belong to the people.
[02:48:26.477 --> 02:48:32.419]  We need more mom-and-pop radio stations and TV stations, not more bilge.
[02:48:34.260 --> 02:48:35.600]  I'm out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:35.620 --> 02:48:36.981]  It was a great show today.
[02:48:37.041 --> 02:48:38.802]  We do this show Monday through Friday from 11 to 2.
[02:48:40.071 --> 02:48:48.334]  And then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, be sure to visit the website InfoWars.net and be sure and get my videos.
[02:48:48.374 --> 02:48:50.534]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement is now out.
[02:48:50.574 --> 02:48:51.615]  It's a powerful film.
[02:48:52.035 --> 02:48:53.355]  My book's Descent into Tyranny.
[02:48:53.935 --> 02:48:58.317]  Go to InfoWars.net to order it online or call toll free 1-888-253-3139 That's 888-253-3139

[02:49:22.275 --> 02:49:23.136]  God bless you all.
[02:49:26.737 --> 02:49:28.678]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[02:49:28.778 --> 02:49:37.502]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Berkey
