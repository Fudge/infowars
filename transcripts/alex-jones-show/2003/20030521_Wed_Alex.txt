[00:00:04.344 --> 00:00:07.587]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:15.213 --> 00:00:15.873]  Big Brother.
[00:00:16.514 --> 00:00:17.635]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:19.436]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:20.898]  You want answers?
[00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:22.399]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:23.192 --> 00:00:27.135]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:31.478]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.122 --> 00:00:38.223]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:38.503 --> 00:00:43.166]  Welcome to another live edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:43.927 --> 00:00:45.548]  It is already Wednesday.
[00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:51.955]  The 21st of May 2003 will be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.055 --> 00:00:57.119]  We've got several guests coming up and we're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:10.548]  There is a bunch of new news and developments on the economy as the world is terrified by the fact that our government is deliberately driving down the dollar.
[00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:17.944]  We'll also talk about Total Information Awareness Network, changing its name to try to confuse the public.
[00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:22.585]  The Big Pentagon's snooping system, known originally as Echelon.
[00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:24.565]  They always change the name to confuse things.
[00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:29.506]  They've gone up to Orange Alert again yesterday afternoon.
[00:01:30.647 --> 00:01:33.647]  Protests now a terrorist act in California.
[00:01:34.127 --> 00:01:35.928]  This out of the Oakland Tribune.
[00:01:37.068 --> 00:01:42.109]  And how this integrates in with other news articles of the tyranny now enveloping the country.
[00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.453]  There is the first case of confirmed Mad Cow Disease.
[00:01:47.513 --> 00:01:50.395]  It's been here for a while, but now in Canada.
[00:01:51.216 --> 00:02:00.504]  We'll be going over that as well, what's happening with SARS, and how our government says, brace for Al Qaeda attack, give all your rights up, we'll take good care of you.
[00:02:01.005 --> 00:02:03.927]  Just do what the men in black ski masks say.
[00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:06.710]  It's all coming up today, and
[00:02:07.896 --> 00:02:10.017]  Last night I went and saw The Matrix.
[00:02:10.218 --> 00:02:12.739]  I'm going to give about a five minute review of that.
[00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.861]  I think a transcript of my review should be made.
[00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:18.002]  I want to give a warning about this film.
[00:02:19.063 --> 00:02:26.408]  If there was any questions about being from Illuminati origin, those are now answered.
[00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:36.094]  I would not let my children watch the film, and if you want to see it yourself to see the face of the New World Order, go ahead.
[00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:47.671]  But it's very, very dark and very evil is all I can really say about Matrix Reloaded.
[00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:52.775]  But I'm going to go over some of it here on the show.
[00:02:53.315 --> 00:02:56.918]  In fact, I will do that at the bottom of the hour.
[00:02:56.958 --> 00:02:58.780]  I'll do that in about 28 minutes.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.742]  I'll do a little 5-10 minute review of the film.
[00:03:03.317 --> 00:03:05.341]  Talk about the globalists throwing it in your face.
[00:03:05.421 --> 00:03:09.067]  They certainly did that in this film.
[00:03:09.948 --> 00:03:12.673]  And some will say, oh, but it's warning us of the New World Order.
[00:03:13.534 --> 00:03:16.179]  My friends, it's revelation of the method.
[00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.383]  The Illuminati sat there in the movie talking down to everyone.
[00:03:20.844 --> 00:03:24.869]  The ads before it did that, and people didn't even know what they were watching.
[00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:34.883]  At the end of the film, I talked to about 10 people randomly coming out of cross-section, and they had no idea what they'd just seen subconsciously being programmed by the Matrix itself.
[00:03:36.147 --> 00:03:41.552]  And I don't mean the type of matrix they have in the film, the psychological spiritual matrix, the globalist control.
[00:03:42.032 --> 00:03:52.341]  The whole thing is the Illuminati talking down to you and explaining why they're exposing this and how they need to have you accepted and give you choice and free will.
[00:03:53.342 --> 00:04:00.789]  Anyways, I'll go over it without giving away too much of the plot today, but we've got a lot of other serious news to cover.
[00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:10.448]  But I will do a review of Matrix Reloaded today or tonight or this morning, depending on what time zone you're listening to us in.
[00:04:10.528 --> 00:04:11.649]  Again, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:14.318]  Dedicated to resisting the New World Order.
[00:04:14.758 --> 00:04:15.919]  Crime syndicate.
[00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.082]  Dedicated to smashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:04:20.162 --> 00:04:21.843]  Exposing the real matrix.
[00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:26.726]  The brave new world we are entering here on this planet.
[00:04:26.847 --> 00:04:29.088]  Entering into deeper depths of tyranny.
[00:04:29.128 --> 00:04:31.910]  But there is a massive awakening taking place.
[00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.012]  More minds are being freed at an accelerated rate.
[00:04:35.032 --> 00:04:38.395]  So the globalists are desperately counter striking.
[00:04:39.415 --> 00:04:42.676]  As we've been saying here for years, accelerating their program.
[00:04:43.636 --> 00:04:49.658]  Big show, vital info on a hundred different fronts on the show, so stay with us.
[00:04:49.738 --> 00:04:57.980]  And it's all being updated right now at InfoWars.com, at InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:06.123]  So, stay with me today as we track the global developments inside the mind control system.
[00:05:06.163 --> 00:05:07.283]  We'll be right back, stay with me.
[00:05:10.297 --> 00:05:14.180]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.865]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:05:20.145 --> 00:05:30.493]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:05:30.673 --> 00:05:35.017]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:35.978]  We're good to go!
[00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:56.300]  That's right.
[00:06:10.712 --> 00:06:18.100]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.146]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:23.346 --> 00:06:28.992]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:29.212 --> 00:06:33.755]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:06:33.975 --> 00:06:41.140]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.503]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:06:45.843 --> 00:06:48.366]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:06:48.586 --> 00:06:55.333]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our Constitutional Republic.
[00:06:55.533 --> 00:07:00.798]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:00.818 --> 00:07:01.219]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:09.452 --> 00:07:10.193]  Are you prepared?
[00:07:10.393 --> 00:07:12.777]  Seems that more terrorism on our soil is inevitable.
[00:07:12.997 --> 00:07:17.423]  Chemical attacks, biological, nuclear, who knows for sure what dangers lie ahead for America.
[00:07:17.743 --> 00:07:21.208]  Recent articles have pointed to vulnerability in our agricultural industry.
[00:07:21.428 --> 00:07:23.591]  An attack on our food supply would be devastating.
[00:07:24.292 --> 00:07:28.293]  Jerry Deddy from the ARC Institute has been alerting people to this very real possibility for years.
[00:07:28.513 --> 00:07:31.453]  She's helped many of us to prepare for these threats to our survival.
[00:07:31.553 --> 00:07:38.655]  Call the ARC Institute today at 1-800-255-1912 and ask about protecting your family's food supply with heirloom seeds.
[00:07:38.855 --> 00:07:44.176]  Heirloom seeds have been carefully passed down from generation to generation, preserving America's ability to feed herself.
[00:07:44.436 --> 00:07:49.457]  We've certainly been getting some conflicting advice from Washington on how to protect against biological and chemical attacks.
[00:07:49.657 --> 00:07:50.697]  Jerry can help here too.
[00:07:51.517 --> 00:07:56.180]  Surviving a bioterrorist attack will give you all the information you'll need to ensure your family's safety.
[00:07:56.421 --> 00:08:00.343]  They say you can't buy happiness, but peace of mind is available at the Ark Institute.
[00:08:00.463 --> 00:08:02.385]  Call the Ark Institute today, toll free 1-800-255-1912.
[00:08:02.405 --> 00:08:03.446]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arkinstitute.com.
[00:08:14.674 --> 00:08:15.315]  Big Brother.
[00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:17.036]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:17.756 --> 00:08:18.857]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:19.518 --> 00:08:20.318]  You want answers?
[00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:21.999]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.383]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.843 --> 00:08:30.946]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.270]  Welcome back, my friends!
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.442]  It is the 21st of May, 2003.
[00:08:39.722 --> 00:08:41.565]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:42.166 --> 00:08:50.719]  On this live Wednesday edition of the World Wide Broadcast, as we blast out on the AM and FM dials, simulcast on global shortwave and the internet.
[00:08:51.531 --> 00:08:54.073]  At InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:54.093 --> 00:08:58.677]  The global shortwave frequencies during the day from 11 to 2 central are 12.172 and 93.20 and from 9 to midnight 5.085 and 68.90.
[00:08:58.837 --> 00:09:01.679]  Thank you for joining me again in about 22 minutes.
[00:09:01.699 --> 00:09:04.541]  I'm going to do a review of the Illuminati film Matrix Reloaded.
[00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:05.782]  I saw it last night and boy,
[00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:22.105]  I'm going to have to see it again just to take notes the second time.
[00:09:22.165 --> 00:09:37.050]  I was just stunned by the complete revelation of the method by The Globalist in your face, complete with Illuminati names, places, the whole nine yards.
[00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.091]  So it's coming up on the show today.
[00:09:44.378 --> 00:09:45.178]  Heightened alert!
[00:09:45.238 --> 00:09:48.360]  Administration increases terror threat warning level to orange.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.941]  Oh yes, we'll go over that.
[00:09:51.521 --> 00:09:54.243]  Canada hunts for mad cow case origins.
[00:09:54.523 --> 00:09:56.784]  Threats are expanding.
[00:09:56.864 --> 00:09:58.264]  Tests are being urged.
[00:09:58.865 --> 00:10:00.866]  Again, mad cow disease strikes Canada.
[00:10:01.806 --> 00:10:04.647]  We'll also get into state monitored war.
[00:10:04.767 --> 00:10:05.628]  Protesters.
[00:10:05.708 --> 00:10:09.970]  Intelligence agency does not distinguish between terrorism and peace activism.
[00:10:10.962 --> 00:10:17.205]  The California Justice Department says protesting against the war is aiding the terrorists.
[00:10:17.225 --> 00:10:18.106]  There's a quote here.
[00:10:19.106 --> 00:10:21.247]  And so it's going to be a terrorist action.
[00:10:21.267 --> 00:10:23.368]  And of course they have the law now they're trying to pass.
[00:10:23.849 --> 00:10:28.031]  Up in Oregon, life in prison if one protester blocks a street.
[00:10:28.271 --> 00:10:34.554]  Everyone on the street gets life in prison unless you agree to 25 years in a forest labor camp.
[00:10:34.594 --> 00:10:35.875]  That's the exact words.
[00:10:37.119 --> 00:10:38.460]  They're trying to sell us this.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.140]  It's not working.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.861]  They tried to sell us the smallpox shots.
[00:10:40.901 --> 00:10:41.461]  No one took them.
[00:10:42.381 --> 00:10:43.722]  You know, 99 plus percent.
[00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:49.825]  They tried to sell us many different facets of the Total Information Awareness Network.
[00:10:49.865 --> 00:10:50.765]  Everyone revolted.
[00:10:51.265 --> 00:10:59.129]  They tried to sell us minions like Heinz Kissinger, Henry Kissinger over the 9-1-1 whitewash.
[00:10:59.149 --> 00:11:02.250]  People didn't buy it, so they just are not going to have a whitewash at all.
[00:11:02.831 --> 00:11:04.632]  They're trying to sell us open borders.
[00:11:04.712 --> 00:11:05.452]  No one likes it.
[00:11:06.511 --> 00:11:08.954]  Now even some of the Hispanic groups are against it.
[00:11:10.916 --> 00:11:11.737]  It goes on and on.
[00:11:11.797 --> 00:11:12.838]  People are seeing through it.
[00:11:12.858 --> 00:11:14.680]  They try to say a plunging dollar's good.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:20.286]  Well, the stock market's reeling and everyone's panicking and, well, it's not good and we all know that.
[00:11:21.656 --> 00:11:31.563]  People aren't buying their up-is-down, down-is-up, black-is-white, white-is-black, garbage, war-is-peace, trash, like they've been in the past, because it's hurting too bad now.
[00:11:31.963 --> 00:11:46.754]  The real world has slammed into people out there, and let me tell you, it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better, until you wake up and get involved in the arena, instead of sitting there like a mindless, grueling spectator.
[00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:50.213]  Here's a Scotsman article.
[00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:52.117]  Public has lost faith in establishment.
[00:11:52.177 --> 00:11:57.025]  Study finds at record levels people in the United Kingdom do not trust the government.
[00:11:57.907 --> 00:11:58.748]  Yeah, no kidding.
[00:11:59.288 --> 00:12:05.091]  At record levels, 90 plus percent of the British people refuse the MMR jab and say it's deadly.
[00:12:05.552 --> 00:12:07.233]  And all the scientific evidence shows it.
[00:12:07.253 --> 00:12:08.493]  They're refusing wholesale.
[00:12:08.874 --> 00:12:12.116]  The government's panicking, running public service announcements saying you're going to have to do it.
[00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:13.536]  Trying to deny healthcare.
[00:12:13.577 --> 00:12:14.417]  People don't take it.
[00:12:15.017 --> 00:12:15.838]  It doesn't matter.
[00:12:15.898 --> 00:12:18.920]  The entire mass is refusing the control grid.
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.962]  And it's going to get worse for you, New World Order.
[00:12:22.782 --> 00:12:24.123]  It's only by gun.
[00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:26.861]  People are waking up.
[00:12:27.281 --> 00:12:30.503]  More minds are being freed every single day.
[00:12:32.244 --> 00:12:34.406]  Total Information Awareness gets new name.
[00:12:34.606 --> 00:12:36.347]  Old questions persist.
[00:12:37.267 --> 00:12:38.648]  Again, it's like the TIPS program.
[00:12:38.668 --> 00:12:47.474]  They announce that the government, everybody, and their cable guy is going to watch you, and then people have a big backlash to it, and they go, okay, we won't do it, and they change the name and double the funding.
[00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:50.332]  Also, again, the U.S.
[00:12:50.372 --> 00:12:52.795]  bans Canadian beef imports over the Mad Cow situation.
[00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:54.358]  Markets hit by dollars fall.
[00:12:54.458 --> 00:12:56.461]  Recession fears grow as U.S.
[00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:59.185]  launches weapon of mass destruction against Europe.
[00:13:01.127 --> 00:13:03.811]  This is a total theater out of the London Guardian.
[00:13:05.086 --> 00:13:09.571]  Holders of the stock at our Federal Reserve reside in Europe and own the central banks there.
[00:13:10.071 --> 00:13:13.315]  But here in America, our media acts like it's its launch against Europe.
[00:13:13.395 --> 00:13:14.376]  Europe plays along.
[00:13:14.856 --> 00:13:16.678]  Our government says the plunging dollar's good.
[00:13:16.718 --> 00:13:18.280]  This is about empowering the Euro.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.002]  We'll go through the spin today.
[00:13:20.702 --> 00:13:23.325]  Also, calculating US dollar rates fall.
[00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:27.710]  New York Times talking about how tough we are at the dollar's plunging, how great it is.
[00:13:28.504 --> 00:13:32.508]  Like it's a football game or something, like it's some tactic to increase manufacturing.
[00:13:32.908 --> 00:13:35.211]  As the manufacturing shuts down, more theater.
[00:13:35.591 --> 00:13:37.613]  It's like they told you NAF and GATT would be good for you.
[00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:41.677]  They tell you there's a difference between the liberal and conservative New World Order.
[00:13:41.957 --> 00:13:43.298]  What version are we going to have?
[00:13:43.338 --> 00:13:45.540]  They're masters at giving you false choices.
[00:13:46.441 --> 00:13:48.043]  Just like the left-right discussion.
[00:13:49.617 --> 00:13:53.301]  Hardcore opposition to Euro at 45% peak.
[00:13:53.321 --> 00:13:56.565]  45% above the all-time peak level of 70-plus percent against it.
[00:13:56.585 --> 00:14:00.209]  I don't know how you have a 45% increase of 70-plus percent.
[00:14:00.229 --> 00:14:01.010]  We're already against it.
[00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:05.475]  But hardcore opposition to Britain joining the single currency has risen to 45% of all voters.
[00:14:05.775 --> 00:14:06.636]  The highest level yet.
[00:14:06.937 --> 00:14:09.600]  Threatening to close down Tony Blair's referendum options.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:13.582]  But the poll shows that the majority of British voters believe it is now inevitable.
[00:14:13.882 --> 00:14:15.983]  The country will have to join the Euro within 10 years.
[00:14:16.043 --> 00:14:18.324]  See, they've convinced you that it's inevitable.
[00:14:18.344 --> 00:14:20.725]  You go in a gun shop, they say, yeah, they're gonna ban guns.
[00:14:20.785 --> 00:14:21.425]  It's inevitable.
[00:14:21.845 --> 00:14:23.746]  You can't fight City Hall.
[00:14:23.886 --> 00:14:24.547]  It's inevitable.
[00:14:25.727 --> 00:14:26.347]  It's amazing.
[00:14:27.548 --> 00:14:30.990]  Also, Soros selling dollars hits U.S.
[00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:31.810]  policy.
[00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:32.790]  Oh, really?
[00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:33.991]  He's fighting with George Bush?
[00:14:34.011 --> 00:14:35.732]  He's dumping dollars just like George Bush.
[00:14:35.772 --> 00:14:36.952]  They're all out of the same club.
[00:14:37.312 --> 00:14:38.333]  Cut from the same cloth.
[00:14:39.122 --> 00:14:40.824]  Congress curious about Iraq deals.
[00:14:40.864 --> 00:14:44.848]  Members for both parties want details of awarding of contracts.
[00:14:45.609 --> 00:14:51.295]  Now it's over $9 billion that Dick Cheney gets, his company Halliburton gets, that he's CEO until 2000.
[00:14:53.037 --> 00:14:54.558]  No bids allowed.
[00:14:54.658 --> 00:14:57.041]  Corruption at record levels.
[00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:59.310]  Also, it's coming out, U.S.
[00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.271]  Postwar effort almost a fiasco.
[00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:03.192]  Nearly 40 days after the fall of Baghdad, U.S.
[00:15:03.252 --> 00:15:07.294]  efforts to restore order and establish a functioning administration in Iraq are faltering.
[00:15:07.694 --> 00:15:08.835]  It's designed to falter.
[00:15:08.855 --> 00:15:12.237]  That's why they organized the looting to have a breakdown of society.
[00:15:12.257 --> 00:15:17.900]  Now, as I said they would say, they're saying, we're not ever going to be able to rebuild Iraq.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.821]  There won't be elections for five years.
[00:15:20.762 --> 00:15:22.943]  Nearly 40 days after the fall of Baghdad,
[00:15:23.712 --> 00:15:25.253]  The globalist controlled U.S.
[00:15:25.413 --> 00:15:30.457]  efforts to restore order and establish a functioning administration in Iraq are faltering as U.S.
[00:15:30.477 --> 00:15:37.342]  forces struggle to cope with lawlessness and fragile infrastructure and fractious Iraqi political forces, analysts said.
[00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:48.790]  Also, a Toronto Star shill story, Iraq war helped boost Al-Qaeda, allowed network to recruit experts, Saudi envoy wants warrants of more attacks in the U.S.
[00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:50.792]  and Saudi Arabia, and there's been bombings from
[00:15:52.125 --> 00:16:15.127]  Turkey yesterday to over the weekend of course the situation in Morocco and of course many bombings multiple bombings three bombings in Israel and bombings in Saudi Arabia two weeks ago and now we're on orange alert they're saying brace for massive attack give all your rights up we're gonna pass Patriot Act 2 it's for your own safety we're gonna ban all protests
[00:16:17.079 --> 00:16:22.062]  Because we're in a war, and you've got to take the rights away so we can have our freedom.
[00:16:22.082 --> 00:16:24.023]  You've got to take the freedom away so we can have our freedom.
[00:16:24.563 --> 00:16:32.207]  And by the way, NAFTA and the Gatineau borders are good, and the slumping dollar is good, and the Easter Bunny is good, and blah, blah, blah.
[00:16:33.308 --> 00:16:34.609]  Total lies.
[00:16:35.729 --> 00:16:43.734]  The U.S.-led war in Iraq gave Al-Qaeda the opportunity to reinvigorate its weakened terrorist network with new recruits and more funding to the experts on terrorism.
[00:16:43.754 --> 00:16:45.835]  The Iraq war clearly increased the terrorist impulse.
[00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:51.754]  said Jonathan Stevenson, Senior Fellow for Counterterrorism at London's International Institute for Strategic Studies.
[00:16:53.035 --> 00:16:53.656]  Give me a break.
[00:16:53.716 --> 00:16:57.439]  Talk about a CFR front group, a Royal Institute of International Affairs front group.
[00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.482]  Folks, they had a staged war.
[00:17:01.822 --> 00:17:05.265]  The leaders of Taliban and Al Qaeda, now over 8,000 of them, sat in
[00:17:08.982 --> 00:17:18.529]  Kabul and sat in Kandahar, and they had young men pressed into service outringing the cities who were shelled and bombed by B-52s.
[00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:26.335]  And then C-130s publicly landed, hundreds of them, and loaded these men on board and flew out Taliban and Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:26.435 --> 00:17:34.761]  Our government did, mainstream confirmed, and dropped them off in Pakistan and paid them, ladies and gentlemen, just like they pay the Iraqi Republican Guard.
[00:17:36.402 --> 00:17:38.003]  Now that is the reality.
[00:17:39.778 --> 00:17:41.179]  That is the reality.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:50.544]  And then they rounded up a bunch of young men and old men and flew them out to Camp X-Ray to be tortured, and the media said they were torturing them, and the top general resigned over it.
[00:17:50.904 --> 00:17:52.705]  Rick Baucus said he wouldn't torture.
[00:17:53.126 --> 00:17:54.626]  They torture people to death in Afghanistan.
[00:17:54.666 --> 00:18:00.190]  It's all a drill to lower the mindset of our troops, turn them into servants of the Dark Lord.
[00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.551]  This is what's happening.
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:04.902]  Same thing in Iraq.
[00:18:04.962 --> 00:18:06.825]  Totally staged, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:07.065 --> 00:18:08.507]  And reconstituted.
[00:18:08.527 --> 00:18:11.051]  It wouldn't be Al-Qaeda if it wasn't for the CIA.
[00:18:13.249 --> 00:18:14.170]  That's the reality there.
[00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:27.716]  MMR kids five times more likely to develop autism, the Scotsman, peers over the safety of the MMR vaccine were ignited yesterday, reignited after a controversial study claimed it put children at much higher risk of neurological disorders.
[00:18:27.776 --> 00:18:29.597]  There's hundreds of major studies, folks.
[00:18:30.057 --> 00:18:41.483]  The research said children were five times more likely to suffer from autism after receiving the MMR jab and after receiving the combined DTP vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus, and prosthesis.
[00:18:43.251 --> 00:18:44.011]  Whooping Cough.
[00:18:44.072 --> 00:19:00.981]  It says the American scientist behind the study published online in the medical journal International Pediatrics added that there was also a marked increase in other neurological disorders such as brain damage or mental retardation in children who received the MMR vaccine as opposed to those who received the DTP jab.
[00:19:02.421 --> 00:19:12.687]  Now what happened is autism increased by roughly, according to the reports, three thousand percent in England, two thousand plus percent in this country.
[00:19:13.522 --> 00:19:19.244]  Children who were healthy and happy at 18 months would receive the jab, go into convulsions, die in many cases by the tens of thousands.
[00:19:19.844 --> 00:19:23.706]  Large portions of children had IQ reductions across the board.
[00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:35.970]  But most children that got sick just got autism because there are hormones, not the mercury, hormones that have been found in these shots that attack the cerebral cortex.
[00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:43.093]  They're mixed with the pathogens the body creates an autoimmune response to that causes an allergic reaction in the brain tissue.
[00:19:44.199 --> 00:19:46.580]  Literally x-raying the eggs like in Brave New World.
[00:19:47.801 --> 00:19:48.862]  Your IQ reduction.
[00:19:49.282 --> 00:19:53.404]  So they knew people were waking up, so they said, oh, it's this one shot, this triple combo shot.
[00:19:53.885 --> 00:19:55.265]  We'll give you the shots individually.
[00:19:55.285 --> 00:19:58.968]  We're brewing up some special stuff here at the Ministry of Defense for you.
[00:20:00.168 --> 00:20:01.929]  Hope you enjoy yourselves.
[00:20:01.989 --> 00:20:06.932]  So when they get caught, they'll try to make it a substory and divert you off into the general system.
[00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:08.313]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:12.188 --> 00:20:12.709]  It's here.
[00:20:12.989 --> 00:20:13.689]  It's powerful.
[00:20:13.989 --> 00:20:22.576]  The Big Berkey is so powerful, it can remove pathogenic bacteria, transforming raw pond water and lake water into delicious, clear drinking water.
[00:20:22.876 --> 00:20:24.717]  Imagine what it will do for your tap water.
[00:20:24.977 --> 00:20:27.059]  No need for expensive, disposable filters.
[00:20:27.319 --> 00:20:31.560]  After 6 to 12 months, simply clean the ceramic filters and you're back in business.
[00:20:31.841 --> 00:20:37.562]  The inner core reduces unhealthy chemicals such as chlorine, herbicides, pesticides, and foul taste and odors.
[00:20:37.742 --> 00:20:39.523]  The powerful filter sets up in minutes.
[00:20:39.683 --> 00:20:42.924]  No plumbing, tools, electricity, confusion, or hard work.
[00:20:43.104 --> 00:20:44.665]  Get the powerful Berkey now.

[00:20:57.891 --> 00:20:59.933]  Not yet available in California and Iowa.

[00:22:02.215 --> 00:22:02.395]  1-800-622-8446.
[00:22:02.535 --> 00:22:03.116]  Easy way to remember it?
[00:22:03.136 --> 00:22:03.156]  1-800.
[00:22:09.098 --> 00:22:13.362]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[00:22:13.802 --> 00:22:18.366]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[00:22:18.746 --> 00:22:23.610]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[00:22:23.971 --> 00:22:25.772]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[00:22:25.812 --> 00:22:26.833]  can barely be read.
[00:22:27.133 --> 00:22:28.074]  It has faded that much.
[00:22:28.434 --> 00:22:32.336]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[00:22:32.616 --> 00:22:40.980]  We bring them to you by using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antiqued parchment paper all ready for framing.
[00:22:41.241 --> 00:22:49.105]  But you don't just get the declaration which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents for just $24.95 shipping included.
[00:22:49.405 --> 00:22:53.347]  And as a special gift for ordering now, you will also receive a commemorative U.S.
[00:22:53.387 --> 00:22:55.628]  Constitution proof silver dollar with your order.

[00:23:01.493 --> 00:23:02.914]  Don't wait, do it today!
[00:23:03.254 --> 00:23:03.695]  The number 800-686-2237.
[00:23:08.715 --> 00:23:11.318]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:23:11.578 --> 00:23:17.324]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:23:17.544 --> 00:23:18.925]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:23:19.025 --> 00:23:22.709]  In fact, you continue to acidify it with a primarily cooked food diet.
[00:23:22.869 --> 00:23:28.955]  You still use either meat, fish, eggs, and or dairy products for your protein instead of spirulina and chlorella.
[00:23:29.095 --> 00:23:31.558]  The two most important protein superfoods known.
[00:23:31.898 --> 00:23:41.529]  Finally, you don't consume ionized water, normal tap water that is transformed into a powerful antioxidant that is very alkaline, balancing your body pH as it brings you into homostasis.
[00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:46.054]  It's also very hydrating and more importantly, extremely detoxifying.
[00:23:46.555 --> 00:23:50.159]  If you want to learn more on how to naturally rid the body of any disease,
[00:23:50.199 --> 00:23:53.162]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:17.962 --> 00:24:18.682]  Welcome back.
[00:24:18.903 --> 00:24:24.725]  I will review the Matrix in the next segment.
[00:24:26.386 --> 00:24:27.367]  Matrix Reloaded.
[00:24:30.008 --> 00:24:35.711]  And of course, we'll take your calls about any of the issues we've already raised.
[00:24:35.731 --> 00:24:39.933]  The mad cow disease in Canada, and I guarantee you it's here.
[00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:47.513]  The situation with the plunging dollar and the economy and our government saying that's a good thing.
[00:24:47.533 --> 00:24:57.738]  If you've seen The Matrix and any facets of it that I haven't mentioned that you'd like to discuss, we will talk about it here on air today.
[00:24:59.459 --> 00:25:03.801]  Also, this Hyphen Alert Administration Increases Terror Threat Warning Level.
[00:25:03.821 --> 00:25:05.902]  The orange emails are cited.
[00:25:07.042 --> 00:25:07.823]  And again, this is the
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:14.925]  The head fox telling you he's going to protect you from a pack of weasels that are in its employ.
[00:25:15.726 --> 00:25:19.489]  The Bush administration raised the domestic threat level to orange or high today.
[00:25:19.509 --> 00:25:23.832]  A decision made in part because of a series of threatening messages found on the internet.
[00:25:24.593 --> 00:25:25.694]  ABC News has learned.
[00:25:27.135 --> 00:25:30.498]  An FBI bulletin obtained by ABC News points to two recent emails.
[00:25:31.599 --> 00:25:32.500]  Intercepted by U.S.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:43.907]  intelligence, one message according to the bulletin, warns of a possible devastating attack in the next 48 hours, and urged all Muslims to leave all cities, especially Boston, New York, and the commercial coastline.
[00:25:43.927 --> 00:25:52.813]  And they've got army helicopters swarming all over the East Coast, globalists stomping around everywhere, trying to get us that troops equal safety.
[00:25:54.194 --> 00:25:56.896]  When what troops equal is oppression of the people.
[00:25:58.087 --> 00:26:00.809]  They had police detectives out looking for suspicious people.
[00:26:00.829 --> 00:26:09.893]  That'd be one thing, but when it's the cable guy in your house and the military in the sky surveilling you, I mean, they've been wanting to do this forever and now they're doing it.
[00:26:10.814 --> 00:26:16.617]  However, one government official said intelligence analysts have serious doubts about the credibility of the source of those messages.
[00:26:16.657 --> 00:26:22.280]  A separate message targets Washington and again points to possible attacks in New York and the nation's beaches.
[00:26:23.441 --> 00:26:24.001]  Now remember,
[00:26:24.978 --> 00:26:37.189]  ABC News has reported, it was first broken by Capitol Hill Blue, WorldNet Daily ran a story, terror alerts manufactured, White House ordered FBI and CIA to issue fake terror alerts to quote, create hysteria.
[00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:41.352]  Now if you or I did that, we'd be arrested and we should.
[00:26:42.173 --> 00:26:45.576]  It's yelling fire in a theater, it's much worse, but it's for political gain.
[00:26:46.698 --> 00:26:52.363]  You're not going to discuss Halliburton getting now a $9 million contract, no bids allowed in Iraq.
[00:26:52.744 --> 00:27:02.132]  You're not going to discuss the plunging dollar and what's happening to the stock market and how our factories are shutting down and how debt illegals are falling, busting out of trucks as our borders are so wide open.
[00:27:03.273 --> 00:27:07.557]  You won't worry too much about Rumsfeld's plan to go ahead and invade North Korea that's been made public.
[00:27:08.482 --> 00:27:16.567]  You're not going to worry about Bush saying he'll sign the most draconian gun control legislation ever seen, the Clinton Assault Weapons Ban, with all the added gun control on it.
[00:27:17.608 --> 00:27:19.349]  No, it's rally around the President.
[00:27:19.789 --> 00:27:27.174]  This is by design, as they distract you with these wars, as you shift into mindless group thinking, become tribal, they're controlling you through this system.
[00:27:28.755 --> 00:27:31.637]  Are the British going to complain about the deadly vaccines?
[00:27:32.536 --> 00:27:32.896]  Well, no.
[00:27:32.916 --> 00:27:35.137]  There'll be terror alerts and lots of terror attacks.
[00:27:35.177 --> 00:27:35.997]  They've promised them.
[00:27:36.497 --> 00:27:38.998]  And so, the government's going to keep them real safe.
[00:27:39.618 --> 00:27:41.019]  And then I read articles like this.
[00:27:41.039 --> 00:27:42.919]  This is out of the Oakland Tribune.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.800]  Protests as a Terrorist Act.
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:52.843]  And it says, if you protest against the war on terrorism, this act does include bombing innocent civilians and threatening the Constitution.
[00:27:52.863 --> 00:27:56.124]  You're engaged in a terrorist act according to the state of California.
[00:27:56.144 --> 00:27:57.464]  This is out of the Oakland Tribune.
[00:27:58.064 --> 00:27:58.785]  There's the quotes.
[00:27:58.845 --> 00:28:00.085]  You can make an easy kind of
[00:28:00.908 --> 00:28:11.893]  Link, that if you have a protest group protesting a war where the cause that's being fought is against international terrorism, you might have terrorism at the protest.
[00:28:12.634 --> 00:28:16.015]  These are quotes by the State Attorney General, Mike Van Winkle.
[00:28:16.816 --> 00:28:20.117]  You can almost argue that a protest against that is a terrorist act.
[00:28:20.698 --> 00:28:24.539]  I've heard terrorism described as anything that is violent or has an economic impact.
[00:28:24.659 --> 00:28:25.980]  See, this is the definition.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.061]  We keep warning you.
[00:28:28.425 --> 00:28:31.986]  And shutting down a port certainly would have some economic impact.
[00:28:32.447 --> 00:28:34.767]  Terrorism isn't just bombs going off and killing people.
[00:28:35.108 --> 00:28:37.168]  Mike Van Winkle, California Justice Department.
[00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:43.451]  Jaywalking is listed as an action punishable by secret execution.
[00:28:43.811 --> 00:28:48.873]  It actually says any action that endangers human life is a violation of any federal or state law.
[00:28:50.834 --> 00:28:55.537]  And they say, in the new Patriot Act, you don't even have to do something that bad.
[00:28:55.577 --> 00:29:01.281]  It says totally open-ended, and anyone that tells the public where you've been taken to can be executed themselves.
[00:29:01.741 --> 00:29:13.889]  Now, obviously, they're going to have trouble implementing this, but after they give you more terror, after they convince the useful idiots in government to carry this out, after they get their compartmentalization going, they may be able to do it if we don't speak out.
[00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:16.791]  Bottom line, we've got to expose who's behind the terror.
[00:29:17.762 --> 00:29:22.487]  That's what Mike Van Winkle, California Justice Department minion, had to say.
[00:29:22.507 --> 00:29:25.349]  And we see other states moving with the same type of legislation.
[00:29:27.512 --> 00:29:37.701]  Up in Oregon, they have the bill where if one person in a protest blocks traffic or anyone else, everyone in the protest gets life in prison.
[00:29:37.962 --> 00:29:39.563]  25 years of it in a forced labor camp.
[00:29:40.144 --> 00:29:42.246]  A forest labor camp, word for word.
[00:29:43.783 --> 00:29:44.764]  Does it intimidate me?
[00:29:44.804 --> 00:29:45.764]  It makes me angry?
[00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:49.826]  If we don't stand up and have courage against this, they will win!
[00:29:52.227 --> 00:29:54.008]  It's coming down to total dictatorship.
[00:29:54.108 --> 00:29:55.068]  It is happening here.
[00:29:55.168 --> 00:29:56.009]  It has happened here.
[00:29:56.369 --> 00:29:57.689]  Tell you about the Makers when we get back.
[00:30:00.491 --> 00:30:01.391]  We're on the march.
[00:30:01.891 --> 00:30:03.492]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:04.413 --> 00:30:07.114]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:10.299 --> 00:30:12.900]  You're sick because you allow yourself to remain sick.
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:18.883]  And you remain sick because you don't provide your body with the enzymes and other nutrients that only come from raw foods.
[00:30:19.123 --> 00:30:20.484]  You haven't alkalized your body.
[00:30:20.604 --> 00:30:21.244]  In fact, body.
[00:30:21.624 --> 00:30:21.884]  That's 877-605-9200.
[00:30:21.904 --> 00:30:22.184]  Call today.
[00:30:58.179 --> 00:31:00.800]  All right, my friends, welcome back.
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:12.985]  More on the economy, the open borders, the plunging dollar, the heightened alert, bracing for more globalist orchestrated terror attacks, mad cow disease in Canada, and much more.
[00:31:14.008 --> 00:31:16.410]  And of course, your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:22.194]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:31:22.314 --> 00:31:26.918]  I want to spend 5-10 minutes on The Matrix Reloaded.
[00:31:26.938 --> 00:31:29.239]  I did go and review it last night.
[00:31:31.721 --> 00:31:36.865]  And I would hope that our listeners that produced transcripts of my analysis
[00:31:37.651 --> 00:31:49.694]  We'll do that so we can post it on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and get it out to the people so they know the truth and understand what is developing and happening.
[00:31:51.754 --> 00:32:02.477]  The first matrix was obviously New Age in its overall presentation.
[00:32:03.736 --> 00:32:11.706]  That you've got to believe in yourself and then you can change the parameters of reality from within.
[00:32:14.129 --> 00:32:20.597]  And it had the overall message that there is another reality, that we are in a false reality.
[00:32:21.813 --> 00:32:38.486]  It covered and explained denial, how some people want to remain inside the lie, don't want to know the truth, don't want to remember the truth, want to be reinserted into the fraud at the cost of their sovereignty, their liberty, their freedom, their creativity.
[00:32:41.688 --> 00:33:05.812]  And it had, of course, a lot of violence in it, but it was a fight against machines, so it wasn't real human beings that were dying, and there were a lot of young people that were affected by the powerful and dark overtones of the film, and were obviously already unstable.
[00:33:07.395 --> 00:33:13.896]  Whether it was because of government programming or the general culture, and went out and shot people and cited the film.
[00:33:15.477 --> 00:33:17.217]  And so, I was ambiguous.
[00:33:17.417 --> 00:33:33.440]  I'm certainly a Christian and didn't follow the New Age Hindu or Buddhist line, but I was still, overall, not sure if the film was a production of the Globalist.
[00:33:36.047 --> 00:33:48.816]  Well, now I am sure that the Matrix 1 and the Matrix 2, Matrix Reloaded, are, in the most pure sense, Illuminati productions.
[00:33:54.139 --> 00:34:05.707]  The film begins, obviously, with a group of trailers, and there is a widescreen shot
[00:34:07.239 --> 00:34:28.130]  That has been squeezed down and distorted as an authority figure type man in black sits behind a table with flickering subliminals being splashed on the screen talking about power aid.
[00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:29.811]  This is before the film begins.
[00:34:31.855 --> 00:34:39.984]  And he talks down to you and says you're not even going to understand what I'm saying to you, you pathetic mindless hive mind of units.
[00:34:40.805 --> 00:34:43.147]  You are units that power the Matrix.
[00:34:43.768 --> 00:34:46.731]  Drink your power aid.
[00:34:48.052 --> 00:34:50.295]  Do as you are ordered to do.
[00:34:52.887 --> 00:35:02.494]  So that's how the film begins and then it launches into the world of the Matrix.
[00:35:02.554 --> 00:35:09.939]  That is the real physical world of the underground base of Zion.
[00:35:09.959 --> 00:35:12.481]  Yes, Zion.
[00:35:14.142 --> 00:35:20.307]  And you have the marauding forces that surface
[00:35:22.364 --> 00:35:39.069]  To the wrecked cities above and transmit the minds or the souls in a type of digital astral projection into the machine world or the matrix.
[00:35:39.389 --> 00:35:45.031]  And you're told that both of these are reality because perception is reality.
[00:35:49.901 --> 00:36:10.287]  And the whole film is basically Illuminati characters, dark masonic overtones, with a dark occult leader, and he says that we are the occult, we're the vampires, we're the werewolves, we're the demons, telling them that
[00:36:11.528 --> 00:36:15.054]  And of course he's called the Merovingian or the Merovingian bloodline.
[00:36:15.074 --> 00:36:22.247]  This is what the Satanists based in France believe that they are descendants of Jesus and he's brothers with Satan.
[00:36:22.307 --> 00:36:24.371]  This is deep occult Illuminati stuff.
[00:36:26.074 --> 00:36:31.739]  And he tells them how pathetic and little they are, how they're controlled by their instincts, how he manipulates those.
[00:36:31.819 --> 00:36:42.448]  It's kind of like the speech you see Al Pacino give in Devil's Advocate and how they can't control these impulses and how they really need the Illuminati.
[00:36:42.528 --> 00:36:46.492]  And he, of course, stays in a French castle.
[00:36:47.802 --> 00:36:53.146]  By the way, our world leaders just met in a French castle in the very countryside they represent in the movie.
[00:36:53.806 --> 00:36:55.828]  Of course, the Merovingian is French.
[00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:01.492]  And, again, I'm showing you about small tidbits of this.
[00:37:01.532 --> 00:37:03.853]  I've got to go back and take notes, which I will do.
[00:37:04.074 --> 00:37:11.058]  This is a... I've never seen a more powerful, overtly soul-twisting, mind-control film.
[00:37:11.699 --> 00:37:17.103]  There is lesbian and homosexual scenes in the film, mass orgies,
[00:37:18.786 --> 00:37:20.508]  Similar to what the Greeks engaged in.
[00:37:22.329 --> 00:37:29.876]  There also is, everyone has chip implants and chip plug-ins, and this is a good thing.
[00:37:29.916 --> 00:37:35.561]  We have a little speech in there where the machines aren't bad, we can fight them with all of this.
[00:37:35.601 --> 00:37:38.963]  So it's making it a new fashion statement.
[00:37:39.003 --> 00:37:45.109]  Probably one of the strongest cultural movements we've seen in history, in modern history, is the Matrix.
[00:37:46.707 --> 00:37:55.609]  The video games and the cartoons now and the bunch of spin-off cartoons for the big screen and DVD.
[00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:07.932]  They, again, are conditioning the children that it's normal to have plug-ins into your mind, wire heads, as they were called decades ago.
[00:38:08.992 --> 00:38:12.433]  It is rational to have implant points all over your body.
[00:38:14.187 --> 00:38:17.552]  Also, it gets into the satanic view of do as thou wilt.
[00:38:17.632 --> 00:38:27.948]  You have people within the Matrix, different programs, fighting with each other for control and domination, but at the end of it, you are face-to-face with the Architect,
[00:38:28.792 --> 00:38:40.341]  And again, this is the Masonic 33 degree and above view that they are shaping our world and even if the Matrix is defeated, it still wins because it replicates itself.
[00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:41.582]  It is in time and space.
[00:38:41.622 --> 00:38:44.604]  It can go back in time and restart itself.
[00:38:47.686 --> 00:38:56.593]  And the architect, this old man, Sigmund Freud, Obi-Wan Kenobi archetype, sits there and
[00:38:58.354 --> 00:39:18.684]  Tells Neo that they have allowed people to leave the Matrix, that they discovered that suppressing an Exodus from the Matrix actually causes a shutdown and a degradation of the 99% that remain inside their Exaluthel tanks
[00:39:25.692 --> 00:39:28.734]  As human batteries for the power grid.
[00:39:30.976 --> 00:39:46.585]  And again, you find out that basically the computers are disembodied spirits, are angels, are devils, and have all the same carnal desires as humans, but with an added
[00:39:48.713 --> 00:39:50.874]  Viciousness like Greek God.
[00:39:51.154 --> 00:39:54.335]  So, it is an Illuminati film through and through.
[00:39:54.375 --> 00:39:56.416]  They tell you we are the Illuminati.
[00:39:56.836 --> 00:39:58.436]  We are throwing this in your face.
[00:39:59.136 --> 00:40:02.898]  They look right at you in the screen and say, we're taking over.
[00:40:03.278 --> 00:40:04.878]  There's no way to defeat us.
[00:40:05.038 --> 00:40:06.479]  We're going to dominate you.
[00:40:06.779 --> 00:40:10.100]  We're going to bring you into the Evermind, the Hive Mind.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:16.722]  And it's not just Wired Magazine and Silicon Weekly and many other publications.
[00:40:18.291 --> 00:40:23.173]  Including Salon today that are warning you of the takeover.
[00:40:24.334 --> 00:40:32.037]  Last year a new Army War College report in 2000 came out and said within 25 years we will all be in a hive mind.
[00:40:32.057 --> 00:40:44.783]  That the Pentagon will oversee the insertion of the public into a control grid that we will all
[00:40:45.535 --> 00:40:52.921]  B, mounted in our homes, wired in to a global government mind control computer.
[00:40:52.981 --> 00:40:53.922]  It actually said this.
[00:40:53.942 --> 00:40:56.224]  Sunday Morning Herald got the federal document.
[00:40:56.264 --> 00:40:57.605]  We called to have DARPA on.
[00:40:58.046 --> 00:41:00.668]  The head scientist, a woman, said, how did you learn of this?
[00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:02.830]  And freaked out and hung the phone up.
[00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:10.716]  These idiots, of course, released this stuff and don't even know what they're up to or perhaps that was an act.
[00:41:10.816 --> 00:41:11.537]  We're not sure.
[00:41:12.461 --> 00:41:19.847]  Three years ago, in 2000, the Army War College said the Army's main job will be, through peer pressure, convincing the public to take brain chips by 2024.
[00:41:22.049 --> 00:41:24.652]  Same year number in the new report last year.
[00:41:26.473 --> 00:41:31.357]  They are preparing you for your journey into the real Matrix.
[00:41:32.538 --> 00:41:37.263]  Now, if you're shocked by this, I've been warning you long before the Matrix came out this was their plan.
[00:41:37.883 --> 00:41:39.885]  The Elite, of course, will not be implanted.
[00:41:41.195 --> 00:41:45.939]  And that most of you are going to be killed after they release mass plagues.
[00:41:45.979 --> 00:41:48.241]  This is if they get you hurt into the larger cities.
[00:41:50.122 --> 00:42:02.772]  And yesterday I read from Wired News, out of the newest DARPA document, where they say everything you do will be tracked and traced and you will be plugged into this system.
[00:42:03.213 --> 00:42:09.558]  I'm sure you saw all the newscasts in the same exact words, in the same order, showing the implantation
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.781]  of members of the public.
[00:42:13.681 --> 00:42:19.884]  I have promotionals where the family that took the chips is called Wondrous, Genius, Cool.
[00:42:20.064 --> 00:42:21.104]  Everybody wants it.
[00:42:21.544 --> 00:42:22.625]  Everybody's gonna get it.
[00:42:23.185 --> 00:42:26.266]  As the Pentagon said, they're gonna use hype to drive and push this.
[00:42:29.548 --> 00:42:30.308]  This is real.
[00:42:30.408 --> 00:42:31.809]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:39.052]  And to have the Illuminati shout at me for two hours was very, very
[00:42:42.031 --> 00:42:42.591]  Painful.
[00:42:44.673 --> 00:42:48.075]  I was nauseated during the first 30 minutes of the film.
[00:42:48.095 --> 00:42:53.219]  I will have to, of course, when it's on DVD, get a copy and try to freeze frame it.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:43:01.005]  There was a continual flickering to the screen, which they admit is for hypnosis.
[00:43:01.764 --> 00:43:24.849]  There are subliminals in the film, both overtly in the tapestry, in the buildings, in the background, in what the people say, and also just like with the Exorcists, which they now admit, which was written by the former Deputy Director of the CIA, they put flash frames, more primitive form of subliminal, in that film, which is now admitted, blood and guts and Satan and images of Satan.
[00:43:26.110 --> 00:43:26.670]  There were
[00:43:27.751 --> 00:43:45.504]  Other subliminals here, I'm not sure exactly what the covert subliminals were, but they were definitely there in the front of the film at higher levels and then saturated in emotional scenes when your conscious mind is diverted in the primitive combat function mammalian activity structure.
[00:43:47.325 --> 00:43:49.487]  So, this is what we're facing.
[00:43:50.728 --> 00:43:54.230]  I recommend that you do not see the film.
[00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:56.632]  I know with a reverse psychology you will probably see it.
[00:43:57.686 --> 00:43:59.067]  Curiosity killed the cat.
[00:44:00.268 --> 00:44:02.790]  I felt like walking out of the film.
[00:44:03.791 --> 00:44:08.975]  It was the most gripping experience of overt mind control I have ever experienced.
[00:44:09.795 --> 00:44:12.357]  We can see what the new science of film is going to be.
[00:44:13.538 --> 00:44:16.000]  So this is a warning to everyone.
[00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:19.443]  Definitely do not let your children see it.
[00:44:20.504 --> 00:44:26.128]  It is a preparation to go into the literal matrix being built by the Pentagon.
[00:44:28.357 --> 00:44:31.018]  In fact, just in case you're doubting me, let me re-read.
[00:44:32.198 --> 00:44:37.660]  From Wired News yesterday, a spy machine of DARPA's dreams.
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:43.262]  This is not a spy machine, this is a casual society control grid once you're buying and selling on the system.
[00:44:43.963 --> 00:44:48.584]  They will then launch attacks that are 1,000 times larger than 9-1-1, at least.
[00:44:49.985 --> 00:44:52.966]  You will then be herded into cities, tracked and traced with cameras in your homes.
[00:44:53.655 --> 00:44:55.976]  Their children will have already been conditioned.
[00:44:55.996 --> 00:44:57.156]  The Washington Post admitted.
[00:44:57.176 --> 00:45:01.338]  The body modification and piercing to condition them to accept implantation.
[00:45:02.138 --> 00:45:05.939]  The films that are flooding out are conditioning them as well.
[00:45:06.559 --> 00:45:12.642]  The children's shows in Canada like Spy TV and the movies here like Spy Kids are all part of this preparation.
[00:45:13.582 --> 00:45:17.543]  It will be made a status symbol to be implanted and this is what the Pentagon says.
[00:45:19.064 --> 00:45:22.105]  So this is the tracking matrix grid that's being built by
[00:45:22.953 --> 00:45:27.156]  Sun Microsystems and Oracle and others.
[00:45:27.516 --> 00:45:28.197]  Oh, Oracle.
[00:45:28.277 --> 00:45:29.377]  Gotta go see the Oracle.
[00:45:29.938 --> 00:45:30.578]  Yes.
[00:45:31.179 --> 00:45:32.359]  The Delphi Technique.
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.961]  A spy machine of DARPA's dreams.
[00:45:35.281 --> 00:45:41.465]  It's a memory aid, a robotic assistant, an epidemic detector, an all-seeing, ultra-intrusive spy program.
[00:45:41.886 --> 00:45:45.008]  Pentagon is about to embark on a stunningly ambitious research project.
[00:45:45.568 --> 00:45:49.270]  Okay, they have the micro... DARPA had microphones by the hundreds in Austin five years ago.
[00:45:49.851 --> 00:45:51.432]  They announced it after it's already in place.
[00:45:52.554 --> 00:46:02.080]  The Pentagon is about to embark on a stunningly ambitious research project designed to gather every conceivable bit of information about a person's life, index it, and make it searchable.
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:07.803]  What national security experts and civil libertarians want to know is why would the Defense Department want to do such a thing?
[00:46:08.709 --> 00:46:13.433]  The Embryonic Life Log Program would dump everything an individual does into a giant database.
[00:46:13.473 --> 00:46:36.950]  Every email sent or received, every picture taken, every webpage served, every phone call made, every TV show watched, every magazine read, all of this and more would combine with information gleaned from a variety of sources, a GPS transmitter to keep tabs on when a person went, audio-visual sensors to capture what he or she says, and biomedical monitors to keep track of the individual's health.
[00:46:37.907 --> 00:46:52.030]  This gigantic amalgamation of personal information could then be used to trace the threads of an individual's life, to see exactly how a relationship or events developed, according to a briefing from the Defense Advanced Research Agency's LifeLog sponsor.
[00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:55.271]  That's total information awareness now changed to LifeLog.
[00:46:56.611 --> 00:46:59.072]  And they meant to call it LifeLog all along, my friends.
[00:46:59.112 --> 00:47:00.612]  They already had these systems set up.
[00:47:00.632 --> 00:47:07.414]  Like, Bill Clinton gave speeches about Homeland Security in 93, I've seen policy papers from 20 years ago calling it Homeland Security.
[00:47:08.903 --> 00:47:20.572]  Life Log is a life log of everything you've done in your life, a recording of it, and digital psychological algorithms to be set up to tailor advertising via brainwashing systems.
[00:47:23.274 --> 00:47:24.315]  It's very serious.
[00:47:24.475 --> 00:47:26.396]  This is the end of the species.
[00:47:26.636 --> 00:47:30.639]  If Satan wins, we must resist.
[00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:33.822]  But just be informed that
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:53.392]  The Matrix is a military industrial complex production in every way and I guess you go deeper down the rabbit hole each trip until you are in a brain scrambled position not even able to resist the new world order.
[00:47:53.412 --> 00:48:00.957]  Of course the Tavistock Institute and other mind control facilities have published studies and we've talked about them on air where if you
[00:48:01.821 --> 00:48:06.645]  Terrorize a mammal for a certain period, it will become docile and accept things.
[00:48:06.725 --> 00:48:15.013]  They need, and they tell you in the film, to explain the Matrix to you and the New World over in the Illuminati so you can be more accepting of it.
[00:48:15.493 --> 00:48:27.924]  But you need that choice that it's something they've got to do due to the rules of God's programming that they are subverting and manipulating with their counterfeits.
[00:48:28.564 --> 00:48:29.305]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:32.242 --> 00:48:35.185]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:48:35.845 --> 00:48:37.126]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:48:37.326 --> 00:48:43.091]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:48:43.352 --> 00:48:48.616]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:48:48.896 --> 00:48:53.020]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:56.981]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:48:57.261 --> 00:49:01.903]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:49:01.983 --> 00:49:08.244]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:49:08.284 --> 00:49:10.045]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:51:44.411 --> 00:51:49.593]  The oldest form of mind control is superstition.
[00:51:50.533 --> 00:51:56.435]  The witch doctor knew when the solar or lunar eclipse was coming
[00:51:58.972 --> 00:52:05.896]  And he was generally part of a hereditary guild, or kind of your first masonic lodge.
[00:52:08.178 --> 00:52:22.106]  And he didn't know why there was an eclipse, but he knew when it was coming, and it happened so infrequently that people would forget about it, he could use that knowledge to shock and amaze members of the tribe, and then get special favors, the best hut, the best women, the best food.
[00:52:23.655 --> 00:52:30.897]  And then later, you've got strongmen over larger tribes that settled in agrarian societies, that is, farming societies.
[00:52:30.977 --> 00:52:35.918]  The kings would learn how to have top witch doctors to manipulate and control the public.
[00:52:38.218 --> 00:52:40.299]  And that's what you have happening.
[00:52:40.739 --> 00:52:43.879]  The globalists know that you're waking up to the fact that there's a new world order.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:51.361]  So they're playing up the psychics and the New Age and all these other religions and the establishment Christians as well.
[00:52:52.814 --> 00:52:55.215]  All putting out their propaganda.
[00:52:57.497 --> 00:53:00.979]  All putting out their false doctrines.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:12.685]  And when you see a society in decline, the empires always use superstition and gladiatorial diversions to divert and distract them.
[00:53:13.746 --> 00:53:16.487]  And that's exactly what I saw in The Matrix.
[00:53:16.527 --> 00:53:17.348]  And overall,
[00:53:19.261 --> 00:53:30.651]  Globalist in your face, admitting it's revelation of the method, Illuminati terms, homosexual orgies, and much, much more.
[00:53:30.772 --> 00:53:45.525]  This is a corrupting film, and if you tell your kids they can't go because they're too young or the movie's too cool for them, no, I would explain to them that it is something meant to degradate them, meant to suck them into the fad system, meant to control them.
[00:53:46.778 --> 00:53:49.820]  It is, my friends, overtly a mind control film.
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:52.802]  I can authoritatively say that to you here today.
[00:53:52.822 --> 00:53:53.902]  And that's all I'm going to say about it.
[00:53:53.942 --> 00:54:03.147]  I know we've got Jason and Gary and Howard and many, many others that are holding.
[00:54:03.167 --> 00:54:06.469]  We'll get to your calls early in the next hour and then into all the rest of the news.
[00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:08.070]  I have not covered yet.
[00:54:08.130 --> 00:54:11.252]  I do want to take a few minutes out here at the end of this segment.
[00:54:12.913 --> 00:54:14.574]  You see, we can defeat the New World Order.
[00:54:15.811 --> 00:54:20.593]  On the basis of the information, on the basis of hard facts, with God's help and direction.
[00:54:21.333 --> 00:54:30.276]  But if they get us off into la-la land, and get us off into delusional stuff, we're never going anywhere, my friends.
[00:54:31.216 --> 00:54:37.759]  The greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us, a scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn in slavery, man, woman, and child.
[00:54:37.779 --> 00:54:43.221]  The United States government, at all levels, has fallen under the control of a desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[00:54:43.241 --> 00:54:44.041]  And they are a clan.
[00:54:44.784 --> 00:54:53.668]  The events of September 11th marked the initiation of the final sick push of the Illuminati to consolidate their One World Order and transform Earth into a prison planet.
[00:54:54.489 --> 00:55:05.814]  In over two and a half hours, I chronicle in stunning detail the true character of the Globalists, learn the master plan of the bloodthirsty elite that financially, physically, and spiritually imprisoned not only America, but the world.
[00:55:06.695 --> 00:55:08.916]  Total Enslavement is the third installment.
[00:55:09.654 --> 00:55:24.969]  My critically acclaimed Police State series, and is a must-see for all who love freedom, the film documents the Patriot Act I and II, the nightmare rise of Homeland Security dictatorship, Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison-death surveillance economy, and much more.
[00:55:24.989 --> 00:55:34.538]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism and how the globalists pose as our saviors, when in fact, they are the terrorists.
[00:55:36.201 --> 00:55:43.343]  Police State 3, Total Enslavement, Masters of Terror, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:55:44.042 --> 00:55:45.363]  America Destroyed by Design.
[00:55:45.403 --> 00:55:47.063]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:55:47.083 --> 00:55:48.564]  They're $25.95 a piece.
[00:55:48.964 --> 00:55:49.865]  All over two hours.
[00:55:50.245 --> 00:55:51.485]  Order three or more, they drop down to $20.
[00:55:51.665 --> 00:55:53.246]  My book is Assent to Tyranny.
[00:55:53.286 --> 00:55:53.386]  It's $12.
[00:55:54.447 --> 00:55:56.728]  Go to Infowars.com or net.
[00:55:57.148 --> 00:55:58.308]  Fight the real Matrix.
[00:55:58.668 --> 00:56:00.009]  Fight the real New World Order.
[00:56:00.249 --> 00:56:01.230]  Realize what they are.
[00:56:01.310 --> 00:56:02.730]  Pathetic bags of pus.
[00:56:03.411 --> 00:56:04.551]  We try to confuse you.
[00:56:04.571 --> 00:56:04.631]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:11.878 --> 00:56:19.500]  That's 888-253-3139 or infowars.com or that second hour straight ahead.
[00:56:21.821 --> 00:56:25.482]  How many of you listening would give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[00:56:26.002 --> 00:56:26.842]  Listen up, folks.
[00:56:26.982 --> 00:56:30.363]  If you're taking vitamins in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:56:30.763 --> 00:56:39.726]  You see, according to the physician's desk, this should... This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:56:47.461 --> 00:56:48.102]  Big Brother.
[00:56:48.762 --> 00:56:49.823]  Mainstream media.
[00:56:50.523 --> 00:56:51.684]  Government cover-ups.
[00:56:52.285 --> 00:56:53.125]  You want answers?
[00:56:53.866 --> 00:56:54.786]  Well, so does he.
[00:56:55.447 --> 00:56:59.189]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:03.733]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:57:05.214 --> 00:57:06.394]  Alright, my friends.
[00:57:08.036 --> 00:57:08.756]  Welcome back.
[00:57:08.956 --> 00:57:12.699]  We're already, what, 30 seconds into the second hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[00:57:12.759 --> 00:57:13.659]  It is Wednesday, the 21st.
[00:57:15.683 --> 00:57:16.063]  Of May 2003.
[00:57:16.163 --> 00:57:19.104]  About two hours left before us.
[00:57:20.004 --> 00:57:23.486]  The total free number to join me on air is 800-259-9231.
[00:57:23.506 --> 00:57:27.247]  More on the heightened alert, back up to orange.
[00:57:27.287 --> 00:57:28.867]  The terror rises into submission.
[00:57:29.467 --> 00:57:31.908]  Canada hit by mad cow disease.
[00:57:32.968 --> 00:57:42.311]  We'll also get into the plunging dollar and state is monitoring war protesters in California and saying that protesting war is a terrorist act.
[00:57:42.351 --> 00:57:43.932]  I have the State Attorney General's quotes here.
[00:57:45.663 --> 00:57:49.026]  Also, public has lost faith in the establishment study finds in England.
[00:57:49.746 --> 00:57:54.770]  Total Information Awareness Network, or the Matrix plug-in, its new name, old questions persist.
[00:57:55.791 --> 00:57:58.633]  It's all coming up, this and much more today.
[00:57:58.754 --> 00:58:06.200]  Markets hit by dollars full, as Lord Bush bad-mouths the dollar, as we told you they would do three, four years ago, from their own policy reports.
[00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:09.142]  Jason in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:58:10.023 --> 00:58:10.823]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:58:10.843 --> 00:58:11.504]  How are you doing today?
[00:58:11.724 --> 00:58:12.124]  Pretty good.
[00:58:12.525 --> 00:58:13.946]  I am really, really energetic today.
[00:58:14.865 --> 00:58:18.667]  I feel good, even though I should probably feel bad.
[00:58:18.687 --> 00:58:19.968]  I don't know.
[00:58:20.008 --> 00:58:26.011]  You should feel good that you're obviously awake more than others and we're still alive and we're waking a lot of folks up.
[00:58:26.031 --> 00:58:28.932]  A lot of people are having the blinders taken off.
[00:58:29.292 --> 00:58:29.653]  Certainly.
[00:58:30.553 --> 00:58:31.253]  I've called before.
[00:58:31.273 --> 00:58:34.755]  I'm a political science major in Pasadena, California.
[00:58:35.195 --> 00:58:35.495]  Yes, sir.
[00:58:35.555 --> 00:58:42.479]  And I've got to say that I really appreciate your work and your effort because it really helps people.
[00:58:43.271 --> 00:58:45.612]  Um, more than you think, actually.
[00:58:45.792 --> 00:58:50.853]  But I wanted to ask you, I see that the terror alert is on high now, which is not good for us.
[00:58:51.473 --> 00:58:53.874]  And, um, I was going to ask you a couple questions.
[00:58:54.434 --> 00:59:04.217]  If you think that, um, that terror alert, like the, what do you think SARS and these, like the SARS virus is meant to scare you, just like the terror alert?
[00:59:04.841 --> 00:59:05.581]  Yeah, it is.
[00:59:05.641 --> 00:59:06.461]  It's fear-mongering.
[00:59:06.481 --> 00:59:10.843]  Look, the White House has been caught issuing fake terror alerts to distract the public.
[00:59:10.883 --> 00:59:11.803]  That's on the record.
[00:59:12.483 --> 00:59:17.244]  And it's training us on this color-coded system, the EAS system.
[00:59:17.284 --> 00:59:18.444]  They told you it was Amber Alert.
[00:59:18.484 --> 00:59:20.725]  It's really a FEMA takeover system.
[00:59:22.465 --> 00:59:23.786]  That's what this is really all about.
[00:59:23.966 --> 00:59:27.947]  Setting up, institutionalizing, martial law in the United States.
[00:59:29.961 --> 00:59:36.865]  And what I was also going to ask you is, I'm studying anthropology right now, and the topic came up about overpopulation.
[00:59:37.646 --> 00:59:40.748]  And it says it's going to get really, really bad, really, really soon.
[00:59:40.768 --> 00:59:46.171]  Well, the world population, they have now said, is going to plane off lower than they thought.
[00:59:46.811 --> 00:59:50.113]  The industrialized world is actually in a negative population trend.
[00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:52.515]  That is, more people are dying than are being born.
[00:59:54.090 --> 00:59:54.991]  Europe is dying.
[00:59:55.411 --> 00:59:59.313]  Once a country becomes industrialized, they cease to have as many children.
[00:59:59.373 --> 00:59:59.973]  It's a fraud.
[01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:00.774]  It's a lie.
[01:00:01.274 --> 01:00:02.394]  And the globalists know that.
[01:00:02.414 --> 01:00:09.918]  They're training you with this social Darwinism to accept the globalist mindset of extermination of the public.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:13.520]  Wow.
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:17.202]  I was kind of under the impression that the SARS virus was actually
[01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:19.443]  I don't think so.
[01:00:31.003 --> 01:00:39.647]  It's about, people wouldn't take the smallpox shot, and so now they're trying to scare us back into accepting forced inoculations and quarantine services.
[01:00:39.727 --> 01:00:41.467]  It's all about martial law.
[01:00:41.827 --> 01:00:47.270]  Under a red alert, they quote, could say to the public not to leave your homes, you'll be an enemy if you do.
[01:00:47.290 --> 01:00:48.810]  Yeah, I saw that article.
[01:00:49.210 --> 01:00:50.351]  Yeah, Gannett News Service.
[01:00:50.391 --> 01:00:55.113]  So, this is about training you to live in a locked down, compact city control grid.
[01:00:55.793 --> 01:00:57.994]  And the compact city, that's the FEMA agency, right?
[01:00:58.669 --> 01:01:07.017]  Yeah, it's just a process of locking down your cities, tracking and tracing your purchases, surveilling you, pushing you off the land into compact, controlled cities.
[01:01:07.957 --> 01:01:08.378]  I see.
[01:01:08.438 --> 01:01:13.442]  I thought we would actually be in these FEMA camps.
[01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:19.348]  Well, they are building the FEMA camps, but the cities themselves can be the biggest FEMA camps, like the Warsaw Ghetto.
[01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:23.692]  Stalin would just surround whole countries.
[01:01:24.762 --> 01:01:25.983]  And commit siege against them.
[01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:30.105]  Iraq was in a FEMA camp for 12 years, and now things are getting worse.
[01:01:30.145 --> 01:01:31.046]  There's not a liberation.
[01:01:31.886 --> 01:01:32.607]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:32.647 --> 01:01:33.307]  I appreciate it.
[01:01:33.407 --> 01:01:34.608]  Spread the word about the show.
[01:01:35.309 --> 01:01:39.131]  We'll be right back on the other side, exposing the real Matrix of Control.
[01:01:44.796 --> 01:01:48.439]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[01:01:48.579 --> 01:01:52.962]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[01:01:53.162 --> 01:01:57.665]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the air that you're breathing.
[01:01:57.805 --> 01:02:00.787]  There are no moving parts and it's ideal for odors and allergies.
[01:02:01.068 --> 01:02:05.611]  It works for just pennies a day with 24-hour, 7-day-a-week continuous action.
[01:02:05.951 --> 01:02:09.854]  Made of the finest materials, it has a two-year warranty on all parts and labor.
[01:02:10.115 --> 01:02:12.497]  And the Aeronizer kills bacteria and mold.
[01:02:12.777 --> 01:02:16.680]  It works in the way that nature does in cleaning and purifying the air in your home.
[01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:22.105]  Cooking odors are gone in seconds and pet odors are removed before they become annoying to your friends and family.
[01:02:22.325 --> 01:02:25.247]  Cigarette and cigar odors are no problem for this purifier.
[01:02:25.407 --> 01:02:27.269]  It leaves the air fresh and clean.
[01:02:27.489 --> 01:02:32.113]  For more information about the Aeronizer, call Toll Free and tell them you heard about it on Genesis.
[01:02:32.313 --> 01:02:35.494]  The toll-free number to call is 877-605-9200.

[01:02:39.275 --> 01:02:50.359]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:02:50.639 --> 01:02:55.380]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:02:55.580 --> 01:03:01.242]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:03:01.482 --> 01:03:06.004]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:03:06.224 --> 01:03:13.387]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:03:13.407 --> 01:03:17.949]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:20.630]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:27.553]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:03:42.555 --> 01:03:44.516]  A good healthy heart is serious business.
[01:03:45.076 --> 01:03:49.317]  It's well known that heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in America today.
[01:03:49.717 --> 01:03:52.778]  A cause that in a lot of cases could have been prevented.
[01:03:53.278 --> 01:03:58.879]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to help improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:08.682]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite drops and capsules may increase metabolism in heart muscle tissue, regulate heart rhythm, and improve oxygen and blood flow to the heart.
[01:04:09.295 --> 01:04:10.999]  Your healthy heart is up to you.

[01:04:44.122 --> 01:04:50.144]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:04:50.744 --> 01:04:53.785]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:55.905 --> 01:04:57.106]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:04:57.566 --> 01:04:59.246]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:04:59.266 --> 01:05:04.508]  Let's dive straight back into the calls for all the folks who have been patiently holding.
[01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:06.928]  Gary in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:05:06.948 --> 01:05:07.528]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:05:07.548 --> 01:05:09.849]  Thanks for the call.
[01:05:12.837 --> 01:05:13.837]  Yeah, how are you doing today?
[01:05:14.077 --> 01:05:15.258]  I'm doing okay, Gary.
[01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:16.618]  Alright.
[01:05:17.418 --> 01:05:34.322]  Well, I had something to say about one of my son's friends that's doing the Air Force after they both graduated from high school, and then I had a question I wanted to answer about myself.
[01:05:35.342 --> 01:05:40.423]  I've had all my teeth pulled, so bear with me until I get my dentures.
[01:05:41.147 --> 01:05:42.428]  I hope I can talk pretty straight.
[01:05:42.748 --> 01:05:43.929]  Yeah, you're talking just fine.
[01:05:43.969 --> 01:05:44.329]  Go ahead.
[01:05:44.429 --> 01:05:45.030]  Okay, thank you.
[01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:55.877]  Okay, my son's friend, he's a good friend of me too, he was healthy as a horse before he joined the Air Force.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:06.004]  They gave him little shots and everything while he was in there during his eight weeks basic training.
[01:06:08.812 --> 01:06:10.815]  I said, what kind of shots did they give you?
[01:06:10.835 --> 01:06:22.933]  His name's Brad, and he said, well they gave me the flu shot and the meningococcal, or meningitis, and he said they gave him about four to six shots of unknown origin that were lettered and unnumbered.
[01:06:25.038 --> 01:06:29.181]  And he didn't ask what they were injecting him with?
[01:06:29.441 --> 01:06:30.161]  No, uh-uh.
[01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:31.302]  No, sure.
[01:06:31.702 --> 01:06:40.527]  And as his fifth week came around, he suddenly developed a form of multiple sclerosis.
[01:06:40.947 --> 01:06:41.388]  Oh, hmm.
[01:06:41.768 --> 01:06:42.028]  Yeah.
[01:06:42.788 --> 01:06:53.995]  And he was bedridden for approximately five, six weeks, something like that.
[01:06:55.616 --> 01:07:04.300]  Uh, well they were treating him with a, uh, MU globin, uh, something they gave him to help fight off the disease.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.742]  Yeah, what they're doing is biological testing on the troops.
[01:07:07.762 --> 01:07:10.023]  They've been caught several thousand times doing it.
[01:07:10.043 --> 01:07:10.523]  Yeah.
[01:07:10.543 --> 01:07:12.684]  And everything from anthrax to other stuff.
[01:07:13.064 --> 01:07:16.266]  Why anyone would take any shot from this government?
[01:07:16.286 --> 01:07:18.887]  You see, it's designed to run all the smart people out.
[01:07:19.551 --> 01:07:26.355]  And how about the dumb people, or folks that aren't conscious in, they've been caught adding every form of evil to these vaccines.
[01:07:26.415 --> 01:07:27.776]  The globalists are desperately wicked.
[01:07:28.256 --> 01:07:31.918]  Anybody that takes their vaccines is insane.
[01:07:32.558 --> 01:07:38.722]  And now under Homeland Security, they're going to set the precedent to forcibly inject all of us when they want, how they want.
[01:07:39.062 --> 01:07:41.563]  This will be the new wonderful tyranny we enjoy.
[01:07:41.583 --> 01:07:45.866]  And as people drop dead in their brain damage, the media will say, oh, it's good.
[01:07:47.509 --> 01:07:52.891]  Well, he finally wound up in a wheelchair, and then he got to where he could walk with a cane.
[01:07:53.871 --> 01:07:55.772]  He could barely do that for a long time.
[01:07:55.792 --> 01:07:56.752]  Oh, there's new good news!
[01:07:56.772 --> 01:07:59.413]  The government's going to engineer vaccines under the food!
[01:07:59.693 --> 01:08:00.613]  We won't have a choice!
[01:08:00.653 --> 01:08:01.113]  How does that sound?
[01:08:01.133 --> 01:08:01.513]  Oh, yeah.
[01:08:01.733 --> 01:08:02.974]  I've heard you talk about that.
[01:08:03.494 --> 01:08:04.554]  Oh, that's great.
[01:08:04.734 --> 01:08:05.635]  I love our government.
[01:08:05.675 --> 01:08:06.675]  It's so good.
[01:08:06.995 --> 01:08:08.255]  It's just crazy.
[01:08:09.236 --> 01:08:10.556]  Well, they discharged him.
[01:08:10.596 --> 01:08:15.978]  They sent him home back to his mom and dad, and it took him about a year to get back to himself.
[01:08:18.019 --> 01:08:22.900]  He said some of the guys that bunked with him had come down with the same thing.
[01:08:23.641 --> 01:08:30.903]  I just told him, I explained to him a lot of the stuff that you'd been talking about.
[01:08:30.923 --> 01:08:35.904]  He went through a real rough time, he thought he was going to die he said.
[01:08:37.355 --> 01:08:43.121]  Well, imagine taking your 18-month-old baby in, your baby's giggling, talking to you, walking.
[01:08:43.641 --> 01:08:56.274]  Give your child a shot in the car home, it's having convulsions, your child dies, and the AMA says, oh, this was caused by something else, or your child sits in the corner and wears diapers for the rest of their life, and, oh, that's just the way it is.
[01:08:56.314 --> 01:08:57.335]  The government loves you.
[01:08:57.776 --> 01:08:58.477]  Yeah, I know.
[01:08:58.997 --> 01:09:00.579]  It's just sick.
[01:09:01.596 --> 01:09:06.037]  It's so sick, the average person can't face the horror, so what's going to happen to them?
[01:09:06.137 --> 01:09:12.999]  Okay folks, decide to throw your lot in with the globalists, decide to believe everything they say, go ahead!
[01:09:13.699 --> 01:09:17.520]  Just go ahead and enjoy yourselves, that's all I can say.
[01:09:17.540 --> 01:09:31.203]  Well the last question about myself, I just turned 50 years old in March, and anyway, my left eye was cut out with a rock when I was 4, so I've
[01:09:31.861 --> 01:09:37.583]  I had to use my right eye pretty much all my life and it's getting to where I can't hardly read.
[01:09:38.783 --> 01:09:41.464]  And I was in a real bad wreck.
[01:09:41.824 --> 01:09:44.785]  I had to go on total disability.
[01:09:44.845 --> 01:09:47.006]  It messed my neck and my spine up.
[01:09:48.327 --> 01:09:51.168]  And I had to become totally disabled.
[01:09:52.368 --> 01:09:56.529]  And I was just wondering, what's going to happen to me when all this stuff comes about?
[01:09:56.549 --> 01:09:58.170]  Are they going to just do away with me?
[01:09:58.955 --> 01:10:10.583]  They are going to put you in the compact city and you will live in a small one room apartment with armed SWAT teams all about you.
[01:10:11.163 --> 01:10:13.605]  Cameras everywhere, thumb scanning to get your food.
[01:10:13.625 --> 01:10:20.950]  And the first time you get sick, they're not going to treat you, they're going to put you on hospice, strap you down and dehydrate you to death.
[01:10:20.970 --> 01:10:23.131]  That's terrible, ain't it?
[01:10:23.846 --> 01:10:26.227]  Well, I don't mean to scare you, but that's what they want to do to you.
[01:10:26.267 --> 01:10:33.208]  And they say publicly, a big top head of a federal agency says they need to abort people's babies if there's any problems with them, forcibly.
[01:10:33.228 --> 01:10:38.670]  I mean, our government, Communist China, is the model of euthanasia and fantasized forced abortion.
[01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:39.550]  Let's be honest.
[01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:41.310]  And that's going to happen to me, too.
[01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:43.011]  You know, when I'm sick, you won't have a choice.
[01:10:43.091 --> 01:10:44.891]  It's going to happen to all of us.
[01:10:44.951 --> 01:10:46.032]  It's part of the new freedom.
[01:10:47.132 --> 01:10:51.833]  Well, I just hope God gives me the guts to fight, to die.
[01:10:52.438 --> 01:10:53.638]  That's Patrick Henry did.
[01:10:53.798 --> 01:10:55.219]  Well, you say you have a son.
[01:10:55.239 --> 01:10:56.899]  Yeah, well, I got two boys.
[01:10:57.139 --> 01:11:02.121]  Your boy's job is not to move away and take some jobs and make a little more money.
[01:11:02.741 --> 01:11:04.521]  Their job is to take care of you.
[01:11:05.481 --> 01:11:05.981]  Right, yeah.
[01:11:06.002 --> 01:11:08.042]  If they don't take care of you, they're going to hell.
[01:11:08.542 --> 01:11:10.263]  They have been.
[01:11:10.343 --> 01:11:12.763]  Okay, and that's what family is all about.
[01:11:13.123 --> 01:11:14.364]  Yeah, well, they're 24 and 21.
[01:11:14.724 --> 01:11:15.864]  Yeah.
[01:11:16.824 --> 01:11:19.405]  And they've been helping me out some.
[01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:27.992]  Well, the Bible is very clear on some of the little children, and that means people that are disabled, people that are hurt, people whose minds aren't all there, children.
[01:11:28.752 --> 01:11:37.515]  And you're supposed to take care of your parents, you're supposed to honor them, and that's why we've gone into this society and we stick our parents in these nursing homes, we don't even visit them.
[01:11:37.955 --> 01:11:41.596]  It's one thing if somebody's got to have you in a nursing home, you should visit them every day.
[01:11:42.096 --> 01:11:43.217]  Morning, noon, and night.
[01:11:44.177 --> 01:11:45.097]  That's true.
[01:11:45.117 --> 01:11:47.038]  I believe that with all my heart.
[01:11:49.915 --> 01:12:00.238]  You know, parents change diapers, give the children the food, give them the love, and there's some type of sick break because people always have the instinctive need to take care of their parents.
[01:12:00.758 --> 01:12:02.819]  I don't know how somebody couldn't take care of their parents.
[01:12:03.199 --> 01:12:04.079]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:12:04.619 --> 01:12:07.540]  Yeah, and there's a lot of these so-called Christians who don't.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.741]  They probably don't like hearing this, but there's a nice warm place ready for them.
[01:12:12.021 --> 01:12:13.022]  Right.
[01:12:13.042 --> 01:12:16.463]  So you shouldn't go to the FEMA camp because your family should take care of you.
[01:12:18.376 --> 01:12:25.924]  Well, like I said, I ain't going to take no mark, that's for sure.
[01:12:25.944 --> 01:12:32.690]  I'd rather be shot in the head than to take the mark of the devil.
[01:12:33.191 --> 01:12:36.234]  Well, by the way, they're already killing people by dehydration.
[01:12:36.814 --> 01:12:37.935]  Wall Street Journal reports.
[01:12:38.196 --> 01:12:38.997]  Naming the names.
[01:12:39.017 --> 01:12:39.837]  I mean, it's already here.
[01:12:40.138 --> 01:12:40.978]  The evil's here.
[01:12:40.999 --> 01:12:42.180]  Appreciate the call.
[01:12:42.754 --> 01:12:47.577]  Gary, and I'm sad to have to give you the real scoop, but that's where we're going, and we don't stop this.
[01:12:47.597 --> 01:12:54.202]  But you've got two sons, and that's what it's all about, and they better take care of you.
[01:12:54.842 --> 01:12:56.464]  Let's talk to Howard in Texas.
[01:12:56.484 --> 01:12:57.404]  Howard, you're on the air.
[01:12:57.464 --> 01:12:57.905]  Go ahead.
[01:12:58.265 --> 01:12:59.206]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:12:59.446 --> 01:12:59.746]  Fine.
[01:13:00.066 --> 01:13:11.254]  Hey, Alex, you had two guests on yesterday on the talk show, and one of them, I think, it either was the guest or it was a caller.
[01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:18.525]  It said that Abraham Lincoln, that he was, or his administration was the first dictatorship.
[01:13:19.025 --> 01:13:20.286]  I disagreed with that.
[01:13:20.346 --> 01:13:21.586]  I said, that's not true.
[01:13:21.746 --> 01:13:22.946]  Andrew Jackson?
[01:13:23.626 --> 01:13:26.427]  Yeah, I forgot who it was that made that comment.
[01:13:26.467 --> 01:13:29.247]  And I said, whoa, that's not true.
[01:13:30.007 --> 01:13:38.489]  Lincoln, you know, when it comes to the Civil War, Lincoln and Jefferson Davis agreed upon the Republic.
[01:13:39.608 --> 01:13:43.989]  The only thing that they disagreed, you know, they were having problems with was slavery.
[01:13:44.349 --> 01:13:45.749]  But that was a minor issue.
[01:13:45.930 --> 01:13:47.090]  Yeah, the war was over.
[01:13:47.130 --> 01:13:48.990]  Who was going to control western expansion?
[01:13:49.130 --> 01:13:49.530]  That's right.
[01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:52.091]  The British financed the South, manipulated the North.
[01:13:52.131 --> 01:13:52.791]  That's right.
[01:13:52.811 --> 01:13:53.971]  They controlled both sides.
[01:13:54.231 --> 01:13:55.672]  And it was the Europeans.
[01:13:56.212 --> 01:14:05.574]  Because Lincoln intercepted a lot of telegrams and just was blown away that the Europeans were trying to do the divide and conquer.
[01:14:05.594 --> 01:14:07.855]  Split the Republic.
[01:14:08.275 --> 01:14:08.955]  Because Lincoln
[01:14:09.574 --> 01:14:16.059]  Before he was assassinated, he wanted to return the Republic back to the original state it was in.
[01:14:16.079 --> 01:14:21.384]  Well, I'll say this, he didn't want to have a brutal reconstruction, and that's one of the main reasons for the assassination.
[01:14:21.644 --> 01:14:32.693]  Yeah, because he, uh, he, uh, he just, and not only that, he, they, they went from Plan A to Globalist at the time, went from Plan A to Plan B, because Plan A failed.
[01:14:33.253 --> 01:14:34.834]  Couldn't split the Republic.
[01:14:35.955 --> 01:14:38.157]  So they went to Plan B, get rid of Lincoln.
[01:14:38.601 --> 01:14:49.706]  Because Lincoln wanted to restore the South and the North to the original condition it was in before the Civil War.
[01:14:49.726 --> 01:15:00.111]  And basically, that's why Lincoln made comments about tyranny, saying that if tyranny hit the Republic, the people had a right to overthrow their government.
[01:15:00.611 --> 01:15:05.413]  Lincoln was very much for the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights.
[01:15:06.093 --> 01:15:07.414]  Lincoln was not for
[01:15:08.106 --> 01:15:09.026]  The 14th Amendment.
[01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:17.710]  Because Lincoln knew what the consequences of the 14th Amendment would do to the sovereignty of the state.
[01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:25.353]  His thing was, if you keep them all separate, and keep them as nation states... Well, both sides were being manipulated.
[01:15:25.533 --> 01:15:26.214]  That's right.
[01:15:26.414 --> 01:15:29.455]  So I wouldn't say either side was right in that, really, I've studied it.
[01:15:29.775 --> 01:15:31.916]  Well, they were, the North was being manipulated.
[01:15:32.446 --> 01:15:37.188]  And the South has been... And British troops were mashing up in Canada.
[01:15:37.468 --> 01:15:44.571]  Yeah, and not only that, the French and everybody else was in there to break up the Republic.
[01:15:45.391 --> 01:15:55.495]  You know, and I sat there and I said, Lincoln, when you look at it, most of the officers from West Point went to the Confederacy.
[01:15:56.335 --> 01:16:00.417]  Over 100,000 soldiers from the Union Army deserted.
[01:16:01.713 --> 01:16:04.595]  Lincoln ended up with a general who was a drunk.
[01:16:05.456 --> 01:16:09.078]  I mean, the Oz and the North... Yeah, Ulysses S. Grant.
[01:16:09.218 --> 01:16:10.599]  That's right, he was a drunk.
[01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:13.482]  Lincoln was, like, praying.
[01:16:13.862 --> 01:16:15.743]  Lincoln was a very spiritual man.
[01:16:16.023 --> 01:16:17.745]  No, yeah, his wife was in the vehicle.
[01:16:17.905 --> 01:16:19.806]  Well, his wife is a different story.
[01:16:20.026 --> 01:16:20.447]  I hear you.
[01:16:20.467 --> 01:16:23.729]  Listen, I appreciate the call, and I appreciate that, Howard.
[01:16:23.749 --> 01:16:24.970]  We'll come back and talk to Ron.
[01:16:26.079 --> 01:16:29.243]  And Angus and others, toll free number to join me on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:16:29.263 --> 01:16:31.646]  Infowars.com, net and prisonplanet.com.
[01:16:31.666 --> 01:16:32.267]  Stay with us.
[01:16:44.221 --> 01:16:48.723]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:53.165]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:16:53.445 --> 01:16:54.005]  We listened.
[01:16:54.305 --> 01:16:59.287]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:16:59.567 --> 01:17:00.048]  We listened.
[01:17:00.428 --> 01:17:03.469]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:17:03.909 --> 01:17:04.429]  We listened.
[01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:08.051]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:08.871]  We're good to go.
[01:17:34.170 --> 01:17:35.793]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:17:35.813 --> 01:17:37.376]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:45.041]  I've lost 26 pounds so far with Vim and Vigor.
[01:17:45.342 --> 01:17:51.325]  Since I've been with Vim and Vigor, I've lost 30 pounds, went from a size 42 to a size 38.
[01:17:51.505 --> 01:17:55.468]  People are flabbergasted when they see me and they can't believe it because they've always seen me heavy.
[01:17:55.768 --> 01:18:01.611]  My weight has shrunk at least two or three loops on a belt, and most of my sweatpants and other pants have just been hanging down.
[01:18:01.631 --> 01:18:09.416]  And I've tried a lot for a lot of years, but I have not, and I can honestly say I have not seen weight loss like I have with Vim and Vigor.
[01:18:09.915 --> 01:18:12.157]  I would highly recommend using Vim and Vigor.
[01:18:12.417 --> 01:18:18.943]  Not only has it helped me lose weight, it has helped my blood pressure, helped me sleep better, and have more energy during the day.
[01:18:19.224 --> 01:18:23.588]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.

[01:18:36.039 --> 01:18:38.823]  Vim and Vigor, call them today, 1-800-622-FIN.
[01:18:38.943 --> 01:18:40.846]  Again, that's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:18:42.589 --> 01:18:46.855]  Our founding fathers wrote down for all time our most precious documents of freedom.
[01:18:47.295 --> 01:18:51.762]  The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Lincoln's Gettysburg Address.
[01:18:52.202 --> 01:18:57.088]  These are the purest forms of our country's freedom before the thousands of politicians got their hands on them.
[01:18:57.448 --> 01:18:59.230]  The Declaration in Washington, D.C.
[01:18:59.270 --> 01:19:00.291]  can barely be read.
[01:19:00.311 --> 01:19:01.573]  It has faded that much.
[01:19:01.913 --> 01:19:05.838]  Now is your chance and your patriotic duty to have it in your home or office.
[01:19:06.098 --> 01:19:07.039]  We bring them to you by using
[01:19:07.039 --> 01:19:14.442]  Using an 11-step process, reproducing these historic documents in exacting detail on antiqued parchment paper all ready for framing.
[01:19:14.703 --> 01:19:22.566]  But you don't just get the declaration which sells for over $100 when framed, but all four documents for just $24.95 shipping included.
[01:19:22.866 --> 01:19:26.808]  And as a special gift for ordering now, you will also receive a commemorative U.S.
[01:19:26.848 --> 01:19:29.149]  Constitution proof silver dollar with your order.
[01:19:29.429 --> 01:19:32.431]  Call now toll-free, 800-686-2237 and order the documents of freedom.
[01:19:34.952 --> 01:19:36.394]  Don't wait, do it today!
[01:19:36.714 --> 01:19:37.235]  The number 800-686-2237.
[01:19:42.105 --> 01:19:45.568]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:19:45.848 --> 01:19:49.351]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:19:49.432 --> 01:19:53.375]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:19:53.615 --> 01:19:59.781]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:00.181 --> 01:20:08.088]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:20:08.488 --> 01:20:13.850]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:20:13.990 --> 01:20:17.771]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:18.132 --> 01:20:19.972]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[01:20:20.052 --> 01:20:22.233]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:20:22.453 --> 01:20:27.055]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:20:27.095 --> 01:20:32.977]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:20:36.378 --> 01:20:38.781]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:40.223]  Protect your family.
[01:20:43.706 --> 01:20:46.449]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:20:46.469 --> 01:20:50.393]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:52.836 --> 01:20:54.558]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:20:54.658 --> 01:20:57.381]  Let's go back to the calls, and I'm going to get back to this key news.
[01:20:57.401 --> 01:20:57.942]  Stay with us.
[01:20:59.156 --> 01:21:02.437]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Oklahoma.
[01:21:02.497 --> 01:21:03.278]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:21:03.318 --> 01:21:03.778]  Go ahead.
[01:21:04.178 --> 01:21:11.001]  Alex, last night CBS ran the second part of their miniseries, Hitler, The Rise of Evil.
[01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:25.367]  The parallels between the Reichstag fire and the Enabling Act, the parallels between that and the Bush administration, 9-11, and the Patriot Act were so glaring it was unbelievable.
[01:21:26.187 --> 01:21:27.327]  They were truly shocking.
[01:21:27.387 --> 01:21:28.588]  I don't know how anyone who saw
[01:21:30.302 --> 01:21:36.245]  Well, it's all revelation of the method they want us to know.
[01:21:36.445 --> 01:21:39.026]  They're using all the same terms on purpose.
[01:21:40.106 --> 01:21:45.589]  Bush's handlers, script writers, certainly must be students of history and have studied Hitler.
[01:21:45.609 --> 01:21:48.370]  I understand Saddam did and other dictators around the world.
[01:21:50.191 --> 01:21:58.575]  The wording, the phrasing that Hitler used in his speech before the Reichstag, after the Reichstag fire to get
[01:21:59.511 --> 01:22:04.694]  Passage of the Enabling Act, which gave him all-encompassing powers.
[01:22:04.934 --> 01:22:06.335]  Did somebody tape that?
[01:22:06.355 --> 01:22:07.936]  I'd like somebody to send me that, please.
[01:22:08.477 --> 01:22:12.619]  I didn't, but I certainly hope somebody does, because you will love it, Alex.
[01:22:12.819 --> 01:22:15.641]  The comparisons are there, they're glaring, they're unbelievable.
[01:22:15.981 --> 01:22:21.285]  So they had Hitler going, the enemy has attacked us, we must round up all the troublemakers?
[01:22:21.305 --> 01:22:21.865]  Absolutely, yes.
[01:22:22.085 --> 01:22:25.607]  Almost word for word what Bush said after 9-11.
[01:22:26.855 --> 01:22:27.455]  It was true.
[01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:30.517]  I had chills running down my back as I watched it last night.
[01:22:30.557 --> 01:22:31.578]  It was unbelievable.
[01:22:31.758 --> 01:22:33.259]  Now, is it going to air again tonight?
[01:22:33.739 --> 01:22:34.159]  No, sir.
[01:22:34.179 --> 01:22:35.440]  That was the second half.
[01:22:36.561 --> 01:22:48.568]  I would like to see your listeners lobby to have it shown again, though, because hopefully there's someone out there in TV la-la land that had brains and brass enough.
[01:22:48.888 --> 01:22:50.509]  Now, what network was this on?
[01:22:50.529 --> 01:22:51.329]  PBS.
[01:22:52.950 --> 01:22:53.511]  PBS.
[01:22:53.571 --> 01:22:55.912]  It was titled Hitler, the Rise of the Evil.
[01:22:56.914 --> 01:22:58.455]  Hitler, the rise of evil.
[01:22:58.655 --> 01:22:58.876]  Yes.
[01:22:59.616 --> 01:23:06.942]  And it paralleled, it paralleled George Bush, his speech, his actions after 9-11.
[01:23:08.463 --> 01:23:22.755]  Homeland Security, the Patriot Act, how Hitler used patriotism to manipulate not only the German Reichstag, the parliament, but also the German people.
[01:23:23.215 --> 01:23:24.016]  It was all there.
[01:23:24.897 --> 01:23:26.578]  It was almost that someone
[01:23:27.361 --> 01:23:35.346]  Like I say, uh, Bush is a panelist, he's a script writer, he's a piece writer, we're students of history and students of Hitler.
[01:23:35.487 --> 01:23:47.795]  Well, I mean, look, our police wear black uniforms and ski masks, they're building giant prisons, they say it's security apparatuses to keep us safe, they call it the homeland, and Bush's grandfather
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.761]  ...was given giant fines and briefly arrested for trading with the enemy.
[01:23:52.821 --> 01:23:57.422]  Prescott Bush, the senator, ran most Nazi operations financially in America.
[01:23:58.202 --> 01:23:59.802]  Right, I've heard that from you a lot.
[01:24:00.302 --> 01:24:03.043]  Well, we've got mainstream news articles on Infowars.com.
[01:24:03.103 --> 01:24:04.583]  I mean, this is the real deal, folks.
[01:24:05.363 --> 01:24:12.125]  I would, uh, I would suggest to your listeners, too, Alex, that they research Hitler and the rise and fall of the Third Reich.
[01:24:12.545 --> 01:24:13.745]  William H. Shirer's book,
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:19.102]  This is a powerful tool when it comes to informing people about what's going on.
[01:24:19.562 --> 01:24:23.785]  The comparison between the Bush administration and the Hitler administration.
[01:24:24.525 --> 01:24:28.007]  John Ashcroft, Homeland Security, Patriot Act.
[01:24:28.927 --> 01:24:31.608]  Yeah, John Ashcroft, Heinrich Himmler.
[01:24:31.628 --> 01:24:32.949]  Heinrich the Hangman?
[01:24:33.729 --> 01:24:40.893]  Heinrich Himmler, yeah, and we've got, I guess Ridge is kind of the Herman Goering, and Cheney is...
[01:24:42.344 --> 01:24:47.926]  Well, I guess kind of a behind-the-scenes guy, but they're not going to get away with it.
[01:24:48.226 --> 01:24:49.306]  Is Rumsfeld Goebbels?
[01:24:51.087 --> 01:24:52.247]  Yeah, I'd have to say so.
[01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:56.368]  He's more of a field marshal or something.
[01:24:57.869 --> 01:25:00.689]  Well, Joseph Goebbels was Hitler's minister of propaganda.
[01:25:00.769 --> 01:25:06.171]  He's the one who said, when you tell a lie, make it big, repeat it often, and most of the people will believe it.
[01:25:07.210 --> 01:25:16.434]  And some people say that that quote isn't accurate because he said what our enemies do is tell a big lie and tell it often enough, but they were still explaining what they did.
[01:25:16.454 --> 01:25:18.655]  I don't know.
[01:25:18.735 --> 01:25:24.077]  I seem to remember from Cyrus' book that the way I quoted it, but I may well be wrong.
[01:25:25.198 --> 01:25:32.661]  No, but what I'm saying is that some people say that that's taken out of context, but no, they're explaining how the big lie works regardless.
[01:25:32.761 --> 01:25:33.882]  It's a statement of fact.
[01:25:34.962 --> 01:25:36.843]  And it is certainly used by our government.
[01:25:40.670 --> 01:25:44.131]  It is being used, and I appreciate your call, Ron.
[01:25:44.171 --> 01:25:45.212]  I wish I would have seen that.
[01:25:45.232 --> 01:25:47.792]  I've gotten some emails and calls about it.
[01:25:47.812 --> 01:25:49.193]  Will somebody send it to me, please?
[01:25:50.233 --> 01:25:52.534]  Let's talk to Angus in Canada, and then we'll hold him over.
[01:25:52.674 --> 01:25:53.374]  Angus, go ahead.
[01:25:53.414 --> 01:25:53.994]  You're on the air.
[01:25:54.795 --> 01:25:55.355]  Hello, Alex.
[01:25:55.655 --> 01:25:56.315]  Hello, Angus.
[01:25:56.335 --> 01:26:02.377]  I thought I'd call you regarding the mad cow disease that was discovered here in Alberta, in northern Alberta.
[01:26:02.677 --> 01:26:04.558]  Sure, and we all know it's been around for a while.
[01:26:05.313 --> 01:26:07.014]  Well, yeah, but that's not the only thing.
[01:26:07.134 --> 01:26:09.895]  I'm an American and I've lived here for eight years.
[01:26:11.396 --> 01:26:19.439]  And one of the things that you see here in Canada is they don't care much for the United States.
[01:26:20.259 --> 01:26:21.220]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:29.363]  We'll get your analysis, your comments on the other side, Angus, and Greg and Ron and George and others.
[01:26:29.603 --> 01:26:30.404]  It's all coming up.
[01:26:30.484 --> 01:26:30.944]  Stay with me.
[01:26:33.070 --> 01:26:36.051]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:26:36.972 --> 01:26:39.753]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:26:42.854 --> 01:26:44.494]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:26:44.835 --> 01:26:50.577]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:26:50.837 --> 01:26:53.758]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the water.
[01:26:53.778 --> 01:26:53.798]  803-4438.
[01:26:53.818 --> 01:26:54.278]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:26:54.298 --> 01:26:55.179]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:27:08.869 --> 01:27:10.770]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:27:11.251 --> 01:27:14.092]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:27:17.274 --> 01:27:22.978]  Folks, you better wake up to how degenerate, ruthless, and predatory the Globals are.
[01:27:23.018 --> 01:27:31.083]  They're a pack of predators, a group of our own species, breeding us, dumbing us down, feeding on us, and they enjoy it.
[01:27:31.183 --> 01:27:32.704]  It's a sporting thing for them.
[01:27:33.324 --> 01:27:34.105]  I'm sick of it.
[01:27:34.585 --> 01:27:35.466]  They're not going to stop.
[01:27:35.486 --> 01:27:36.606]  They're not going to give us quarter.
[01:27:36.646 --> 01:27:37.587]  We can't give them quarter.
[01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:45.364]  Let's go ahead and go back to Angus in Canada, making a point about mad cow disease found up there.
[01:27:45.404 --> 01:27:46.044]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:27:46.684 --> 01:27:47.105]  Ah, yes.
[01:27:49.245 --> 01:28:01.567]  In eight years that I've been here and observed how the Canadian government and oversight organizations operate, I ran a television station in Inuvik, which is 300 miles above the Arctic Circle.
[01:28:02.748 --> 01:28:04.888]  And that was about four years ago.
[01:28:05.709 --> 01:28:16.815]  And one of the things that was going on at that time was antibiotic-resistant TB was coming on the scene quite strongly.
[01:28:17.935 --> 01:28:22.758]  And up in the northern regions of Canada, they had quite a problem with it.
[01:28:23.658 --> 01:28:29.141]  But one of the things that you see here is nothing negative.
[01:28:29.241 --> 01:28:29.981]  It's always covered up.
[01:28:30.321 --> 01:28:31.322]  It's always whitewashed.
[01:28:32.145 --> 01:28:40.113]  So, with the rise of this mad cow, one being discovered, I would urge that the U.S.
[01:28:40.193 --> 01:28:48.241]  Agriculture Department send independent investigators, because it's an economic thing, and anything that hurts the economy here, they shut down.
[01:28:49.482 --> 01:28:54.667]  Now, you talked about dehydration of patients... Let me just say something, if I can, Angus.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.021]  Are owned by the same people.
[01:28:59.061 --> 01:29:03.586]  If there's any left-wing, right-wing fighting going on between the governments, it's totally staged.
[01:29:03.666 --> 01:29:05.608]  It's only peripheral surface level.
[01:29:06.308 --> 01:29:12.874]  Our government has been covering up Mad Cow, and it's going to hurt the industry.
[01:29:12.914 --> 01:29:16.097]  My family raises beef, and it's range-fed.
[01:29:16.117 --> 01:29:16.558]  It's great.
[01:29:17.173 --> 01:29:22.416]  The problem is these feedlots, the type of feed, the blood, the bone, it's allowed to be in here.
[01:29:22.576 --> 01:29:28.920]  In Europe, it's really bad because they would stew all the dead sheep and cows together, put it into a type of protein meal.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:33.543]  You're not supposed to feed cows animal protein anyways, much less rotten meat.
[01:29:34.003 --> 01:29:34.983]  There's toxins in it.
[01:29:35.023 --> 01:29:36.684]  That's what the things are eating.
[01:29:36.724 --> 01:29:37.765]  It gets into their bloodstream.
[01:29:37.805 --> 01:29:38.265]  We eat it.
[01:29:38.305 --> 01:29:40.847]  It gets in the brain and grows protein crystals.
[01:29:41.687 --> 01:29:42.728]  This is the reality.
[01:29:42.768 --> 01:29:44.748]  It's also a cover story for a bunch of other stuff.
[01:29:45.289 --> 01:29:48.510]  And the globalists love all the genetic engineering and all the trash.
[01:29:48.530 --> 01:29:49.931]  It's going to cause a bigger crisis.
[01:29:50.291 --> 01:29:52.251]  They're going to come in and shut down the farms and ranches.
[01:29:52.271 --> 01:29:54.492]  The British government released foot and mouth.
[01:29:54.592 --> 01:29:55.413]  That's admitted fact.
[01:29:56.648 --> 01:29:59.932]  Uh, but certainly, I don't believe a word that comes out of your government.
[01:29:59.952 --> 01:30:04.957]  For those that just joined us, Canada hunts for mad cow case origins, tests URDs, Reuters.
[01:30:05.518 --> 01:30:11.825]  Canadian vets said in Europe on Wednesday they were chasing down possible origins of the country's first mad cow disease case in the decade.
[01:30:12.617 --> 01:30:24.239]  When sent shockwaves to the North, American Food Industry Canada said on Tuesday they found a case of brain wasting bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE or mad cow disease in the western province of Alberta.
[01:30:24.559 --> 01:30:27.400]  The stress of the affected animal had not entered the food chain.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:31.640]  And they could find out real quick where the cow came from, who it was bought from.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:33.721]  Was it from an internal stock or bought from Europe?
[01:30:34.381 --> 01:30:35.841]  Why aren't they telling us that?
[01:30:35.901 --> 01:30:37.802]  Have they sat on your news where the cow came from?
[01:30:37.842 --> 01:30:40.102]  It should take about five minutes to find out.
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:41.420]  Oh, no.
[01:30:41.781 --> 01:30:46.804]  No, I haven't heard anything other than the initial announcement.
[01:30:48.025 --> 01:30:54.408]  Being in the media, this is something that might interest you as well, just because of its chilling effect that we've seen in history before.
[01:30:54.969 --> 01:31:04.895]  There was a story that broke out of Calgary regarding Calgary Foothills Hospital where they were taking less than desirable infants, putting them in a room and letting them dehydrate to death.
[01:31:05.816 --> 01:31:09.538]  When the story broke, the Alberta Provincial Courts
[01:31:10.232 --> 01:31:12.888]  Threw a gag order on them so they couldn't discuss it anymore.
[01:31:14.349 --> 01:31:15.930]  And this was about three years ago.
[01:31:16.190 --> 01:31:16.770]  Well, yeah.
[01:31:16.810 --> 01:31:21.031]  The Wall Street Journal writer Wesley Smith's written two best-selling books that list hundreds of names.
[01:31:21.051 --> 01:31:28.454]  He's done dozens of stories listing the names where someone is paralyzed, neck down, begging water, water for three or four days till they die.
[01:31:28.874 --> 01:31:29.994]  This is the new America.
[01:31:30.074 --> 01:31:32.375]  People begging audibly for water.
[01:31:32.815 --> 01:31:34.575]  Nurses being fired for sneaking water.
[01:31:35.076 --> 01:31:38.917]  When they sneak them water, they'll fire all the nurses and ensure the execution takes place.
[01:31:39.237 --> 01:31:42.318]  But we use the judicial to make sure nobody says anything about it.
[01:31:43.194 --> 01:31:44.315]  That's the spooky part.
[01:31:46.138 --> 01:31:47.459]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:48.420]  Oh yeah.
[01:31:48.841 --> 01:31:49.121]  Oh yeah.
[01:31:49.161 --> 01:31:51.885]  Well, take a real good look at Canada and you'll see what it'll get you.
[01:31:52.705 --> 01:31:55.589]  You look beyond the surface and there's no freedom here.
[01:31:56.510 --> 01:31:59.053]  Canada can no longer be considered an ally.
[01:31:59.133 --> 01:32:01.316]  It's now a national security risk for the United States.
[01:32:01.776 --> 01:32:06.137]  Well... Fraud and incompetence is at such a level here, Alex, that it's unbelievable.
[01:32:06.557 --> 01:32:08.858]  They don't field an army because they don't have one.
[01:32:08.958 --> 01:32:13.839]  The people that own Europe, own America, own Canada, but it is more socialistic.
[01:32:13.899 --> 01:32:18.321]  It's further down the rat hole by a few years, but I know this.
[01:32:20.041 --> 01:32:21.741]  They have a bunch of censors up there.
[01:32:21.821 --> 01:32:24.662]  I mean, they even try to arrest science fiction writers.
[01:32:25.703 --> 01:32:27.783]  They don't like anyone that criticizes the government.
[01:32:28.303 --> 01:32:29.884]  I face arrest talking to you right now.
[01:32:32.492 --> 01:32:32.852]  You know that?
[01:32:33.973 --> 01:32:35.234]  Anything to hurt the economy.
[01:32:35.254 --> 01:32:35.535]  Yes, I did.
[01:32:35.635 --> 01:32:36.716]  Yes, I did.
[01:32:52.415 --> 01:32:55.217]  Protest against the war can be considered terrorism.
[01:32:55.257 --> 01:32:55.817]  Here's the quote.
[01:32:56.358 --> 01:33:07.204]  He said this, you can make an easy kind of link that if you have a protest group protesting a war where the cause is being fought against is international terrorism, you might have terrorism in a protest.
[01:33:07.905 --> 01:33:11.987]  Quote, you can almost argue the protest against that is a terrorist act.
[01:33:12.407 --> 01:33:16.390]  I've heard the terrorism described as anything that is violent or has any economic impact.
[01:33:17.088 --> 01:33:20.630]  And shutting down a port certainly would have some economic impact.
[01:33:20.650 --> 01:33:22.671]  Terrorism isn't just bombs going off and killing people.
[01:33:23.031 --> 01:33:28.013]  Mike Van Winkle, California Justice Department Deputy Secretary of that situation.
[01:33:28.893 --> 01:33:32.135]  Now, this is what the Patriot Act says.
[01:33:32.255 --> 01:33:33.796]  Now we're beginning to learn this.
[01:33:33.916 --> 01:33:37.317]  Learn the deals with banking and IRS and everything else.
[01:33:38.618 --> 01:33:40.739]  And notice this guy's a big liberal.
[01:33:41.839 --> 01:33:49.826]  Supposedly, on paper, we've got the governor there, Davis, gun-grabbing open borders governor, saying, turn your guns in.
[01:33:50.506 --> 01:34:01.195]  And meanwhile, Michael Savage lives in San Francisco, the former admitted beatnik, still a beatnik, the neocon, calling for anyone that protests to be arrested and be put in a camp.
[01:34:01.235 --> 01:34:02.175]  Now, that's word for word.
[01:34:03.356 --> 01:34:05.738]  So, you notice they're really together on this.
[01:34:05.758 --> 01:34:06.919]  There's no separation.
[01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:08.641]  It's like
[01:34:10.087 --> 01:34:14.490]  Crystal's daddy was an Ontroskiite, the founder of the Neokites.
[01:34:15.711 --> 01:34:16.772]  Does that concern you?
[01:34:17.893 --> 01:34:20.115]  Well, let me ask you this.
[01:34:20.535 --> 01:34:22.556]  Have you ever heard of an organization called FARC?
[01:34:24.398 --> 01:34:26.279]  Oh, no, there's the FARC guerrilla down in Columbia.
[01:34:26.299 --> 01:34:28.040]  That's right, out of Columbia, correct?
[01:34:28.641 --> 01:34:31.663]  Two years ago they were here at the University of Alberta raising money.
[01:34:34.505 --> 01:34:36.866]  Well, the Communists are always funded by the government.
[01:34:37.366 --> 01:34:38.627]  They're there to create crises.
[01:34:38.647 --> 01:34:39.887]  They're allowed to engage in terror.
[01:34:39.907 --> 01:34:47.710]  Remember Bill Clinton released, what, 19 members who had engaged in over 300 bombings, killing police officers?
[01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:48.930]  But that's okay.
[01:34:48.950 --> 01:34:49.871]  They're going to be just fine.
[01:34:51.711 --> 01:34:55.973]  I remember I was at the University of Texas one time and the Communists came, so I went to go see them.
[01:34:56.413 --> 01:34:58.054]  And it was right after Tiananmen Square.
[01:34:58.874 --> 01:34:59.835]  They had a nice racial
[01:35:01.573 --> 01:35:10.060]  Representation there, and there was an Oriental gal, and I asked her, I directed my question to her, regarding Tiananmen Square.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:12.321]  They didn't allow her to answer me.
[01:35:13.522 --> 01:35:14.803]  So they moved right on ahead.
[01:35:15.984 --> 01:35:16.665]  That's the new tactic.
[01:35:16.685 --> 01:35:21.228]  Well, of course, and I've got an article here, you know, the New York Times is in trouble for false reports.
[01:35:22.349 --> 01:35:24.351]  That's where Oprah got her start!
[01:35:25.583 --> 01:35:27.584]  Falsifying news stories in Chicago!
[01:35:28.024 --> 01:35:36.887]  Well, we've gone back now, there's an article here, 70 years ago, the New York Times telling us Stalin wasn't killing anybody, and it turns out they knew full well he was.
[01:35:38.208 --> 01:35:42.469]  This is who we're dealing with, folks.
[01:35:42.489 --> 01:35:49.712]  Our member of the Legislative Assembly for Alberta was quoted in the newspaper, not a month ago, lauding Stalin.
[01:35:50.365 --> 01:35:56.368]  And his handling of striking salt mine workers in Siberia by machine-gunning them to death.
[01:35:56.649 --> 01:36:00.010]  Yeah, the communists really care about the people, thanks for the call.
[01:36:00.751 --> 01:36:05.854]  You know, when you hear NPR talk about how they're fighting the establishment, folks, it's Rockefeller, Carnegie, Rodeo.
[01:36:05.934 --> 01:36:06.754]  It's the establishment.
[01:36:07.134 --> 01:36:08.975]  They control the left, they control the right.
[01:36:09.476 --> 01:36:19.041]  You got the Michael Savage, the Beatnik, Daddio, Pimp over there saying, put us all in camps, and he's with the Deputy Attorney General saying, put people in camps.
[01:36:19.841 --> 01:36:21.242]  You're beginning to figure this out, folks.
[01:36:21.262 --> 01:36:22.363]  You're beginning to understand this?
[01:36:22.983 --> 01:36:26.045]  Bush is gun-grabbing, just like Clinton, but at greater levels.
[01:36:26.065 --> 01:36:29.168]  But that's okay, because he's George W. You figure this out yet?
[01:36:29.508 --> 01:36:32.230]  The bankers want consolidated command-and-control governments.
[01:36:32.810 --> 01:36:34.271]  They'll take whatever type they can get.
[01:36:35.412 --> 01:36:37.253]  Let's talk to Greg in New Mexico.
[01:36:37.313 --> 01:36:38.114]  Greg, good to talk to you.
[01:36:38.154 --> 01:36:38.634]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:36:38.654 --> 01:36:41.196]  Appreciate your call.
[01:36:43.438 --> 01:36:43.838]  Okay.
[01:36:44.679 --> 01:36:46.120]  He's walked away from his phone, then.
[01:36:47.060 --> 01:36:47.701]  We'll let him go.
[01:36:48.761 --> 01:36:49.761]  Ron in New York.
[01:36:49.861 --> 01:36:50.681]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:36:50.721 --> 01:36:51.202]  Go ahead.
[01:36:51.462 --> 01:36:51.922]  Hi, Alex.
[01:36:52.302 --> 01:36:53.262]  How you doing?
[01:36:53.482 --> 01:36:56.343]  I'm calling you up about two things, but I will throw a third in.
[01:36:56.403 --> 01:36:58.803]  I saw that movie and it was on the CBS network.
[01:36:59.503 --> 01:37:00.683]  The Hitler movie.
[01:37:01.144 --> 01:37:03.084]  The movie about Adolf Hitler.
[01:37:03.264 --> 01:37:04.204]  Yeah, and it's true.
[01:37:04.244 --> 01:37:13.466]  The part in the movie about the burning of the Reichstag, it did have a strong parallel to a number of things that are happening in our own country today.
[01:37:14.215 --> 01:37:29.100]  He did, and he said temporarily, he went before the Reichstag, a temporary Reichstag that they set up, and he said that in order to protect the nation, he had to suspend freedom of speech, press association, and privacy and communication over the telephone.
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:30.301]  Temporarily.
[01:37:30.841 --> 01:37:33.862]  Of course, we realize how long temporarily was in that case.
[01:37:34.582 --> 01:37:37.223]  But yeah, there was some glaring similarities there.
[01:37:37.717 --> 01:37:43.201]  I saw the movie as well, and it was on CBS, and I believe you can get a copy of the movie from CBS.
[01:37:43.241 --> 01:37:45.022]  They sell their videos, I'm pretty sure.
[01:37:45.042 --> 01:37:47.564]  Well, I hope somebody sends me a copy.
[01:37:48.225 --> 01:38:05.598]  But in any event, moving along to the two subjects that I initially called you about, I now am acquainted with two boys, two 13-year-old boys who wear the Coke bottle type eyeglasses, computer nerds, and they got a visit from the FBI.
[01:38:06.621 --> 01:38:07.561]  This is unbelievable.
[01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:16.605]  They were discussing, they live in two separate states, and one was discussing with the other boy a criminal incident, which was reported in his papers.
[01:38:16.845 --> 01:38:21.326]  It was, you know, I guess a local matter, which was fairly heavily reported in that jurisdiction.
[01:38:22.687 --> 01:38:33.831]  And he had mentioned that in this incident a certain gun was used, and he asked the second boy if he was familiar with that particular caliber gun, and the boy responded that, no, the only gun that I've ever known of
[01:38:34.395 --> 01:38:37.039]  Is that my father owns a .22 caliber rifle?
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:40.264]  Do you know that resulted in a visit from the FBI?
[01:38:41.286 --> 01:38:41.746]  Well, yeah.
[01:38:41.786 --> 01:38:45.372]  They always do the thing that they're going to be doing in five years.
[01:38:45.432 --> 01:38:46.514]  They do it to the kids.
[01:38:48.085 --> 01:38:51.786]  And, uh, look, I told you, sir, I had a carpet cleaner in my house.
[01:38:51.986 --> 01:38:59.287]  He saw a shotgun, you can buy at any store, that's illegal to carry, loaded in my car, and began to shake and ran out of the room.
[01:38:59.487 --> 01:39:06.048]  I called later that night to the place, and there have been discussions of calling the police until the manager said, no, you're allowed to have shotguns.
[01:39:06.748 --> 01:39:08.029]  This is the new America.
[01:39:08.389 --> 01:39:09.289]  Well, that's it.
[01:39:09.329 --> 01:39:10.609]  This is the new America.
[01:39:10.929 --> 01:39:15.090]  This is what, the border is wide open, 18-wheelers are busting open with 19 dead illegals,
[01:39:15.777 --> 01:39:18.939]  There's drug-resistant TB spreading and all this other garbage.
[01:39:19.319 --> 01:39:22.761]  Record numbers of Islamics from terror-sponsored nations are being allowed in.
[01:39:23.101 --> 01:39:24.482]  But that's not a problem.
[01:39:25.082 --> 01:39:28.684]  Kids are being frisked, wearing ID cards, thumb-scanning to get lunches.
[01:39:29.085 --> 01:39:31.986]  They have BATF at hundreds of school districts for a whole semester.
[01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:33.927]  They write dossiers on their parents.
[01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:35.468]  This is in the takeover mainstream news.
[01:39:36.028 --> 01:39:37.589]  And this is the new America, sir.
[01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:42.292]  And the threat to the nation is two boys, two 13-year-old boys, who wear, as I said, cold-bottle eyeglasses.
[01:39:42.819 --> 01:39:46.522]  Discussing a publicly reported criminal incident in just an objective way.
[01:39:47.003 --> 01:39:49.084]  And that's how they're going to protect the nation.
[01:39:49.384 --> 01:39:50.165]  That's a disgrace.
[01:39:50.946 --> 01:39:55.009]  Now, the second thing I want to move on to, actually... Well, what did the FBI say to him when they came?
[01:39:55.429 --> 01:39:57.431]  I don't know the context of the conversation.
[01:39:57.611 --> 01:39:59.593]  I know that basically that was the end of the matter.
[01:39:59.653 --> 01:40:02.816]  However, I want to say one more thing about that before I move along.
[01:40:03.516 --> 01:40:08.000]  Those boys will have, not a criminal record, but there will be a record of that contact.
[01:40:08.504 --> 01:40:15.573]  And somewhere down the road in their life, if they attempt to go for certain jobs or certain clearances, that will always be there.
[01:40:16.094 --> 01:40:19.217]  Because they said, oh, what type of gun your dad got?
[01:40:19.498 --> 01:40:21.560]  Now they're already training the cops that it's illegal.
[01:40:21.941 --> 01:40:23.643]  Now is this an email or a message board?
[01:40:24.577 --> 01:40:30.424]  Uh, as I understand, this was, I believe, email, or point-to-point communication with the computer, you know, when you talk to each other.
[01:40:30.444 --> 01:40:31.805]  Yeah, just setting the precedent, yeah.
[01:40:31.865 --> 01:40:34.348]  And then, of course, it's announced, and it creates a chilling effect, yeah.
[01:40:34.368 --> 01:40:39.934]  So, for all the people out there that think that, you know, this is a great thing, we're being protected,
[01:40:40.274 --> 01:40:41.535]  What were you being protected from?
[01:40:41.555 --> 01:40:51.563]  Two 13-year-old boys talking about a publicly reported... That is 8,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders were flown out by the CIA before Afghanistan imploded in that stage of war.
[01:40:51.744 --> 01:40:56.007]  I think also they're trying to create an environment where people are actually afraid to communicate with each other.
[01:40:56.067 --> 01:40:56.568]  Well, that's it.
[01:40:56.588 --> 01:41:05.635]  They don't have the personnel to even go to one one-thousandth of the one one-thousandths of the calls or emails, but it's this chilling effect.
[01:41:05.675 --> 01:41:07.757]  They're going to focus on the youth, as they've said.
[01:41:08.357 --> 01:41:14.960]  I mean, look, if a kid writes the word gun in an essay in school... I remember writing essays about hunting.
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:18.181]  I would have been arrested, and they would have called for psychological probing.
[01:41:18.942 --> 01:41:20.122]  It's a thought crime system.
[01:41:20.723 --> 01:41:23.744]  So there could be no dialogue about everything.
[01:41:24.384 --> 01:41:33.088]  It nullifies your intelligence because you can't communicate, and then you can't communicate... Just saying my dad got a 22 is now a potential thought crime.
[01:41:33.596 --> 01:41:35.077]  Well, the proof is in the pudding.
[01:41:35.097 --> 01:41:39.158]  Well, they need to sue the FBI, and they need to demand a FOIA request.
[01:41:39.938 --> 01:41:41.179]  Real quick, what else is on your mind?
[01:41:41.199 --> 01:41:45.180]  Okay, secondly, now as you know we're up to the high-level Orange Alert.
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:46.900]  Now, I live in the city of New York.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:49.301]  You've got army helicopters and troops on the streets.
[01:41:49.321 --> 01:41:51.302]  Hold on a second though, let me finish this thought.
[01:41:52.982 --> 01:41:59.565]  Now, they claim one of the reasons that we're at such a high level is because here in the city of New York we have something called Fleet Week.
[01:42:00.365 --> 01:42:00.505]  Now,
[01:42:01.485 --> 01:42:07.908]  The Navy pulls in here, the fleet pulls in here, not for any practical military necessity, but it's almost a ceremonial thing.
[01:42:08.328 --> 01:42:09.729]  It is a ceremonial thing, completely.
[01:42:10.609 --> 01:42:11.190]  Once a year.
[01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:25.557]  However, I said to myself, wait a second, if they feel that by having them here, it increases the chance of New York City being a terrorist target, then why not just, given the situation, have them bypass New York City?
[01:42:26.137 --> 01:42:27.578]  Go and drop anchor
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:33.302]  At their home port, a military facility, because we don't really have military ports in New York City anymore.
[01:42:33.322 --> 01:42:36.664]  They're civilian ports, what we have left of that infrastructure.
[01:42:37.444 --> 01:42:44.708]  Why is it necessary for them to come here, if at the same time they're coming here, they're saying that they're essentially like honey to the flies?
[01:42:45.429 --> 01:42:49.831]  Well, look, the globalists know that... Hold on, conversely... I gotta let you go, man.
[01:42:49.851 --> 01:42:50.931]  You've been on about five minutes.
[01:42:50.951 --> 01:42:52.472]  I appreciate the call, Ron.
[01:42:53.173 --> 01:42:55.034]  And I understand your point.
[01:42:55.054 --> 01:42:55.494]  It's a good one.
[01:42:56.317 --> 01:42:57.978]  There's no real terrorist, but globalist.
[01:42:58.159 --> 01:42:58.539]  Okay?
[01:42:58.599 --> 01:43:05.425]  We've proven this from England, to Israel, to Saudi Arabia, to Afghanistan, to Iraq, to the United States.
[01:43:05.605 --> 01:43:07.066]  Every major bombing is the government.
[01:43:07.667 --> 01:43:09.328]  We have hundreds of cases where they've been caught.
[01:43:09.368 --> 01:43:13.331]  We have their own plans, where the Pentagon explains why they want to do all this.
[01:43:13.972 --> 01:43:14.813]  We know the truth.
[01:43:16.234 --> 01:43:17.495]  We know the reality.
[01:43:19.016 --> 01:43:22.439]  And that's the story we've got to tell, and that's the word we've got to get out to the people.
[01:43:22.479 --> 01:43:24.601]  I'll come back and cover some news and get back into your calls.
[01:43:26.184 --> 01:43:31.930]  Before I go any further, folks, I have produced my 9th film.
[01:43:32.491 --> 01:43:34.713]  It's Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:43:36.475 --> 01:43:39.498]  It is 2 hours and 37 minutes long.
[01:43:40.539 --> 01:43:41.600]  It is jam-packed.
[01:43:41.680 --> 01:43:48.247]  It covers other examples of government-sponsored terrorism, not just 9-1-1 that I cover in Road to Tyranny and Masters of Terror and my book.
[01:43:49.674 --> 01:43:57.197]  It is a really good film, really informative, and I'm proud of it, and I hope you get it, and I hope you watch it in three parts, because I want you to be able to absorb it all.
[01:43:57.217 --> 01:44:00.518]  It is an amazing video.
[01:44:00.598 --> 01:44:02.118]  Believe me, you won't be disappointed.
[01:44:02.259 --> 01:44:04.959]  Get Total Enslavement, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:44:04.979 --> 01:44:06.880]  Get the other two Police State films that are excellent.
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:09.861]  Get 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, and The Mashes of Terror.
[01:44:10.521 --> 01:44:14.703]  Go to InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net to get the videos.
[01:44:15.609 --> 01:44:20.275]  Again, folks, that toll-free number to order my videos is 1-888-253-3139 or InfoWars.com or Net.
[01:44:33.991 --> 01:44:40.795]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:44:40.875 --> 01:44:44.597]  Again, that's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, or 1-888-253-3139.
[01:44:44.697 --> 01:44:45.277]  Get the videos.
[01:44:45.317 --> 01:44:45.818]  Make copies.
[01:44:45.838 --> 01:44:46.958]  Wake America up.
[01:44:46.978 --> 01:44:48.039]  Defeat the New World Order.
[01:44:48.079 --> 01:44:48.639]  We'll be right back.
[01:44:48.659 --> 01:44:49.740]  We're straight ahead.
[01:45:04.073 --> 01:45:10.859]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:12.581]  That's right folks, DVD.

[01:48:04.821 --> 01:48:09.785]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:12.970]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:48:20.653 --> 01:48:25.815]  Alright, coming up in the next hour I've got Eleanor Chavez just coming up about 10-15 minutes from Albuquerque.
[01:48:25.855 --> 01:48:27.516]  We're on out in Albuquerque.
[01:48:29.657 --> 01:48:32.938]  She's joining us to talk about anti-war stance led to eviction.
[01:48:32.978 --> 01:48:36.700]  Pop quiz, in which country can a tenant be evicted for protesting against the government?
[01:48:37.347 --> 01:48:44.712]  The United States, and that's your answer, and now they're talking about prison time and forced labor camps in the mainstream news, laws.
[01:48:45.732 --> 01:48:50.015]  If you protest the government, because that's aiding the terrorists, okay.
[01:48:50.836 --> 01:48:57.360]  But then your president can be in business with them, found the terrorists, protect the terrorists publicly, and no one's supposed to discuss it.
[01:48:58.681 --> 01:49:04.044]  Absolutely incredible, and more of your calls are coming up here momentarily.
[01:49:05.336 --> 01:49:12.238]  We'll get to George and Neil and Troy and Wayne and Ralph and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:49:14.519 --> 01:49:19.701]  The government is terrorizing us on a daily basis, telling us to give up our liberties for so-called security.
[01:49:19.721 --> 01:49:22.962]  You already know about the mad cow popping up in Canada.
[01:49:24.122 --> 01:49:27.383]  Also, the public has lost faith in the establishment of study fines.
[01:49:27.984 --> 01:49:31.865]  Public Trust, a major institution in Britain and worldwide,
[01:49:32.828 --> 01:49:55.013]  says that the government and legal system has fallen again public trust in major institutions in Britain worldwide such as the government legal system has fallen researchers say this is generally static over the years the wider system they are part of were held in esteem but now the research fund has found that ninety one percent of people
[01:49:55.914 --> 01:50:02.724]  Well, 77% said they trusted judges, fell to 53%, and the numbers were even lower for all other government institutions, as low as 20% actually found the study.
[01:50:11.289 --> 01:50:13.750]  Total Information Awareness Network gets a new name.
[01:50:13.870 --> 01:50:14.891]  Old questions persist.
[01:50:14.911 --> 01:50:28.217]  The Pentagon's research arm report released Tuesday changed the name of its mammoth electronic surveillance program following public outcry of concerns that the project will unnecessarily invade privacy without necessarily improving national security remains strong.
[01:50:28.777 --> 01:50:33.759]  Total Information Awareness Program now called the Total Information Awareness Network under development.
[01:50:34.824 --> 01:50:41.348]  It's now called, now get this, the Total Information Awareness Program is now called the Terrorism Information Awareness Program.
[01:50:42.249 --> 01:50:43.429]  Oh, it's just for the terrorists.
[01:50:43.529 --> 01:50:52.735]  Under development at the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, we'll integrate data search pattern recognition and collaborative software to analyze potential terrorist threats.
[01:50:53.931 --> 01:50:56.293]  And the news says, hey, don't complain.
[01:50:56.553 --> 01:50:58.694]  The private corporations already spy on you.
[01:50:58.755 --> 01:51:00.156]  And, oh, they're working with the government.
[01:51:00.216 --> 01:51:00.976]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:51:01.637 --> 01:51:02.938]  Like that's supposed to be okay.
[01:51:02.978 --> 01:51:06.480]  It's like saying, we've had slaves for hundreds of years, so it's all right.
[01:51:07.821 --> 01:51:10.763]  Like precedent makes it okay.
[01:51:11.063 --> 01:51:13.165]  It continues with the news.
[01:51:15.487 --> 01:51:17.348]  Markets hit by dollars fall.
[01:51:18.673 --> 01:51:21.816]  And, uh, it says that, uh, recession fears grow as U.S.
[01:51:21.856 --> 01:51:23.818]  launches weapons of mass destruction.
[01:51:25.659 --> 01:51:35.908]  Stock markets fell sharply around the world yesterday as fears that the Bush administration is deliberately, well, they've been saying it publicly, driving down the value of the dollar, led to the headlong flight out of the U.S.
[01:51:35.948 --> 01:51:38.611]  currency and nudging the euro closer to a record high.
[01:51:40.252 --> 01:51:42.014]  These articles say the dollar's down by 20%, folks.
[01:51:44.119 --> 01:51:49.063]  The Euro was $0.90, now it's $1.15, $1.20, depending on what day it closes at.
[01:51:49.863 --> 01:51:54.507]  So that's like 25% to 30%, depending on what day it is.
[01:51:54.767 --> 01:51:58.670]  Another article calculating U.S.
[01:51:58.730 --> 01:52:00.031]  tolerates a dollar's fall.
[01:52:00.091 --> 01:52:00.731]  Tolerates it?
[01:52:00.771 --> 01:52:03.213]  The globalists are adding to it, pushing it, promoting it.
[01:52:03.233 --> 01:52:04.494]  That's out of the New York Times.
[01:52:05.975 --> 01:52:09.758]  And Soros is selling dollars and hits U.S.
[01:52:09.818 --> 01:52:12.920]  policy, but he's actually with Bush in their actions.
[01:52:14.766 --> 01:52:21.528]  Congress is so-called curious about Iraq deal with Dick Cheney's multi-million dollar contracts with no bids allowed.
[01:52:21.568 --> 01:52:22.948]  That's out of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:52:24.109 --> 01:52:29.250]  Bunch of other news I have not gotten to that I will get to in the next hour.
[01:52:29.330 --> 01:52:31.651]  Your calls, the guests, I'll just have to move quickly.
[01:52:31.671 --> 01:52:36.952]  In the third hour, ladies and gentlemen, on the other side,
[01:52:37.956 --> 01:52:41.617]  I'm Alex Jones, and I hope your station carries the third hour.
[01:52:42.297 --> 01:52:43.197]  It really should.
[01:52:43.637 --> 01:52:48.278]  And I want to thank all our sponsors, all our affiliates, the folks that run the stations, and our listeners.
[01:52:48.958 --> 01:52:51.059]  But I really do think people should carry the third hour.
[01:52:51.419 --> 01:52:51.919]  Stay with us.
[01:52:54.180 --> 01:53:00.381]  Nuclear reactors provide electrical energy across our great nation, but during an accident, would you be prepared?
[01:53:01.081 --> 01:53:04.862]  Medical Course Potassium Iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most
[01:53:08.917 --> 01:53:12.138]  This is the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:53:19.661 --> 01:53:20.322]  Big Brother.
[01:53:20.982 --> 01:53:22.062]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:22.743 --> 01:53:23.923]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:23.943 --> 01:53:25.364]  You want answers?
[01:53:25.384 --> 01:53:26.984]  Well, so does he.
[01:53:27.645 --> 01:53:31.346]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:31.826 --> 01:53:35.928]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:53:38.288 --> 01:53:44.531]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, already in the third hour of this worldwide broadcast.
[01:53:48.833 --> 01:53:50.994]  It is the 21st of May, 2003.
[01:53:51.314 --> 01:53:52.275]  We have a guest coming up.
[01:53:52.995 --> 01:53:55.256]  There's a criminalized protest in this country.
[01:53:55.276 --> 01:54:01.039]  Then I'm going to get into more of the news, but right now, let's go straight back into your calls.
[01:54:02.259 --> 01:54:04.260]  Let's talk to George in Colorado.
[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:05.321]  Thanks for holding, George.
[01:54:05.341 --> 01:54:05.861]  You're on the air.
[01:54:06.502 --> 01:54:07.262]  Yeah, how you doing, man?
[01:54:07.322 --> 01:54:11.404]  I'm a first-time listener, and I got to know where you stand on a couple of things.
[01:54:12.245 --> 01:54:17.927]  On Sunday morning when you go to church, I was just wondering what Bible you carry to church with you.
[01:54:19.688 --> 01:54:20.829]  Well, I don't go to church.
[01:54:20.889 --> 01:54:25.871]  I don't go to worship the government and learn a Masonic religion.
[01:54:26.051 --> 01:54:28.352]  I can't really find a church here locally.
[01:54:28.472 --> 01:54:31.574]  I occasionally go to Tex Mars' church, which is good.
[01:54:32.364 --> 01:54:37.607]  Well, my question is... I don't know off the new Bibles if that's what you're asking, King James.
[01:54:37.747 --> 01:54:41.969]  Well, I guess I'm a fundamental independent Baptist.
[01:54:42.309 --> 01:54:44.590]  Well, today that means that George Bush is God.
[01:54:44.610 --> 01:54:46.211]  Today?
[01:54:46.231 --> 01:54:47.551]  That means George Bush is God?
[01:54:47.732 --> 01:54:48.752]  Well, yeah.
[01:54:48.912 --> 01:54:57.576]  My whole point is... I know the churches here locally worship Bush and say that he's a Christian and say that turning your guns in is good, so I'm not that type of Baptist.
[01:54:58.997 --> 01:55:00.998]  Maybe you're misunderstanding me.
[01:55:01.767 --> 01:55:05.830]  Well, my whole question is the battle of the preservation of the 1611 St.
[01:55:06.071 --> 01:55:07.232]  James Bible.
[01:55:08.493 --> 01:55:10.274]  And I just want to know where you stand on that.
[01:55:10.294 --> 01:55:11.455]  They're rewriting the Bibles.
[01:55:11.515 --> 01:55:13.036]  I was just saying that.
[01:55:13.957 --> 01:55:30.190]  Yeah, and that's a spiritual corrupted, I'm looking for the right terms here, but all these different Bibles are just another means of deceiving
[01:55:30.805 --> 01:55:35.586]  Well, I mean, rewriting history is what tyrants always do, and it's certainly happening.
[01:55:35.646 --> 01:55:35.906]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:35.946 --> 01:55:38.606]  I understand that, and I totally agree with that.
[01:56:00.205 --> 01:56:07.130]  But it's more of a... It's just on a spiritual level here.
[01:56:07.230 --> 01:56:14.095]  Where I'm from here in Colorado, it's like the Mecca where all these Bibles are published and everything.
[01:56:14.756 --> 01:56:18.359]  And we take a lot of heat in that for what we stand for at our church.
[01:56:19.099 --> 01:56:29.507]  And we just believe in the old time religion and serving the Lord Jesus Christ and going out personal soul winning and confrontational soul winning and stuff.
[01:56:30.091 --> 01:56:34.112]  Well, are you telling folks about the cashless society control grid of the New World Order?
[01:56:35.052 --> 01:56:38.613]  No, about accepting Jesus Christ as their personal father.
[01:56:38.654 --> 01:56:40.754]  So your church doesn't talk about the New World Order, though?
[01:56:41.274 --> 01:56:42.435]  Well, no.
[01:56:42.515 --> 01:56:44.035]  I mean, of course.
[01:56:44.195 --> 01:56:46.416]  That's in sermons and everything.
[01:56:46.496 --> 01:56:46.696]  Great.
[01:56:46.736 --> 01:56:48.456]  Listen, I appreciate the call.
[01:56:48.496 --> 01:56:49.937]  Good hearing from you, George.
[01:56:50.737 --> 01:56:53.278]  Let's talk to Troy in New York.
[01:56:53.298 --> 01:56:53.818]  You're on the air.
[01:56:53.878 --> 01:56:54.258]  Go ahead.
[01:56:54.838 --> 01:56:55.498]  Yes.
[01:56:55.558 --> 01:56:57.499]  Thank you for allowing me to speak and be heard.
[01:56:58.368 --> 01:56:59.829]  About the Big Lie Technique.
[01:57:00.670 --> 01:57:06.355]  The Antichrist accused Hitler of inventing and propagating the Big Lie Technique.
[01:57:07.215 --> 01:57:11.199]  This accusation is, in fact, the Big Lie Technique in action.
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:17.063]  You know, it's not the devil who reveals the tricks of the devil.
[01:57:17.844 --> 01:57:20.206]  It's the anti-devil who reveals the tricks of the devil.
[01:57:20.967 --> 01:57:22.548]  And what Hitler said was that
[01:57:23.379 --> 01:57:25.240]  We project ourselves upon the world.
[01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:27.482]  We think the world is like us until we know better.
[01:57:27.502 --> 01:57:29.443]  This is why children are so trusting.
[01:57:30.103 --> 01:57:34.206]  So honest people believe the world is... Others are honest until they learn better.
[01:57:35.447 --> 01:57:44.092]  People cannot imagine... We who tell little lies cannot imagine anyone telling such great, enormous lies, and so we tend to believe them.
[01:57:44.633 --> 01:57:46.254]  Here is the quote.
[01:57:46.834 --> 01:57:50.196]  It's from the Ralph Manaheim translation.
[01:57:50.216 --> 01:57:51.297]  Better read it quick.
[01:57:51.777 --> 01:57:51.897]  It's 231.
[01:57:53.815 --> 01:58:13.298]  In this, the liars proceeded on the sound principle that the magnitude of a lie always contains a certain factor of credibility, of believability, since the great masses of the people, in the very bottom of their hearts, tend to be corrupted or deceived rather than consciously and purposely evil, and that therefore... We're going to have to stay there, and you'll have to come on later after the guest is on.
[01:58:15.163 --> 01:58:18.184]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:58:18.504 --> 01:58:23.426]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:58:23.686 --> 01:58:28.027]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:58:28.328 --> 01:58:37.251]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:58:37.451 --> 01:58:41.052]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:58:41.352 --> 01:58:46.400]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:58:46.681 --> 01:58:53.451]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:58:53.912 --> 01:58:54.453]  What about you?
[01:58:55.206 --> 01:59:00.107]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.

[01:59:15.504 --> 01:59:22.894]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:59:23.154 --> 01:59:27.900]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:33.768]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:59:33.988 --> 01:59:45.892]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:59:45.912 --> 01:59:50.333]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:59:50.613 --> 01:59:53.134]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:59:53.354 --> 02:00:00.117]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:00:00.317 --> 02:00:05.559]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[02:00:05.579 --> 02:00:05.999]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:00:14.281 --> 02:00:21.146]  As a listener to the Genesis Communications Network, you're aware of the many health dangers that have been unleashed upon an unsuspecting public.
[02:00:21.587 --> 02:00:28.732]  We all want to protect ourselves and our loved ones, but how do we do that without costly pharmaceutical products that trade benefits with side effects?
[02:00:29.192 --> 02:00:32.995]  Stabilized oxygen may be just the answer to this question and more.
[02:00:33.375 --> 02:00:40.761]  Stabilized oxygen is an oxidant similar to food-grade hydrogen peroxide, but it is more stable and effective with no unpleasant taste.
[02:00:41.181 --> 02:00:50.431]  By providing your bloodstream with molecular oxygen, it is possible to kill anaerobic bacteria and other parasites on contact without harming tissue or friendly bacteria.
[02:00:51.151 --> 02:00:54.415]  A 120-day supply of stabilized oxygen is just $15 post-pay!
[02:00:56.283 --> 02:01:06.211]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your four-month supply and get the best oxygen boost available in easy-to-take droplet form.
[02:01:06.591 --> 02:01:12.816]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[02:01:15.017 --> 02:01:21.002]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:44.743]  Last hour, I read this bone-chilling report out of the Oakland Tribune.
[02:01:46.164 --> 02:01:49.846]  The Deputy Attorney General, Mike Van Winkle, California Justice Department,
[02:01:51.686 --> 02:02:03.858]  You can make an easy kind of link that if you have a protest group protesting a war where the cause that's being fought against is international terrorism, you might have terrorism at that protest.
[02:02:04.259 --> 02:02:08.263]  You can almost argue that a protest against that is a terrorist act.
[02:02:08.743 --> 02:02:13.929]  I've heard terrorism described as anything that is violent or has any economic impact and shifting down
[02:02:15.149 --> 02:02:22.331]  Or shutting down a port certainly would have some economic impact.
[02:02:23.051 --> 02:02:26.172]  And it says terrorism isn't just bombs going off and killing people.
[02:02:26.192 --> 02:02:28.532]  Well, that's section 802 of the first Patriot Act.
[02:02:28.912 --> 02:02:33.894]  The new definition of terrorism is any action that endangers human life that's a violation of any federal or state law.
[02:02:34.534 --> 02:02:36.614]  The new Patriot Act says that's not broad enough.
[02:02:36.854 --> 02:02:43.116]  Any action, even if it's not illegal, you can be secretly grabbed, tortured, secretly executed,
[02:02:44.309 --> 02:02:53.573]  And so you have the supposed liberal justice department out in California saying if you protest it may be terrorism because you're protesting a war that's against terror, which is a total fraud of course.
[02:02:53.853 --> 02:03:05.117]  It's a war to dominate the planet, steal natural resources and a smoke screen for all the crimes of the administration's past and present with Enron and the rest of it as they suck all the pension funds dry.
[02:03:05.597 --> 02:03:09.899]  One trillion dollars missing, San Francisco Chronicle reported, from
[02:03:11.504 --> 02:03:14.966]  The Pentagon budget, this is unbelievable, folks.
[02:03:15.326 --> 02:03:16.887]  Actually, it's more than a trillion, it says.
[02:03:17.767 --> 02:03:33.295]  And so you've got the liberals out there, they're not liberals at all, they're control freak minions of the New World Order, with the neocon talk show host all over MSNBC and talk radio, saying anyone that criticizes the government's war on terror is helping the terrorists, they should be arrested and put in camps.
[02:03:34.324 --> 02:03:47.913]  We have Senator Menace, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee in Oregon, saying that anyone that criticizes the government, basically, if you protest and block the street, everyone in the protest gets life in prison, 25 years in a forced labor camp.
[02:03:48.033 --> 02:03:50.955]  It actually says that, Forest Labor Work Camp.
[02:03:52.537 --> 02:03:57.380]  We're living in the most bizarre times America has seen since the Civil War, folks.
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:58.981]  And the left and the right, the top,
[02:03:59.616 --> 02:03:59.796]  I think?
[02:04:16.361 --> 02:04:34.599]  Aggressive, preemptive, Hitlerian attacks on sovereign countries that our government told to invade Kuwait, that our government told to attack Iran, that our government trained in 58, Saddam Hussein is a CIA hitman, same thing with Bin Laden, Noriega, the whole nine yards.
[02:04:34.699 --> 02:04:40.104]  So here we sit watching this, and I've got an article here, we've got a guest coming on, Eleanor Chavez.
[02:04:41.249 --> 02:04:42.970]  This is out of the Albuquerque News.
[02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:48.975]  We're on, of course, the show is on at night in Albuquerque on, what is it, 1310.
[02:04:49.775 --> 02:04:52.057]  Anti-war stance led to eviction.
[02:04:52.598 --> 02:04:56.560]  Pop quiz, in which country can a tenant be evicted for protesting against the government?
[02:04:57.041 --> 02:04:58.742]  Answer, the United States of America.
[02:04:59.222 --> 02:05:02.325]  That's what the National Union of Hospital and Healthcare Employees
[02:05:03.977 --> 02:05:11.284]  Unions District 1199 based in Albuquerque found out last month when they were evicted from their offices of San Benito Boulevard.
[02:05:11.304 --> 02:05:20.892]  According to the complaint filed by their landlord, Carroll Ventures Incorporated, the union breached the terms of the lease by holding an anti-war demonstration.
[02:05:20.912 --> 02:05:22.113]  Of course, the lease didn't say that.
[02:05:22.733 --> 02:05:26.837]  The group also created a nuisance and interrupted other tenants' quiet enjoyment of the premises.
[02:05:26.857 --> 02:05:27.818]  The complaint states,
[02:05:28.522 --> 02:05:44.907]  The Union Local definitely held an anti-war demonstration, but it was the intersection of San Benito Boulevard and Cutler Avenue, and not at its offices at 2403 San Benito Boulevard NE, said Hospital Workers Union Director Eleanor Chavez.
[02:05:45.775 --> 02:05:53.518]  As for disturbing other tenants, Chavez says the group met in the building's clubhouse, which is had reserved and used as a staging area for the event.
[02:05:54.018 --> 02:06:05.802]  Well, folks, I mean, look, we had a Patriot Act meeting about the Patriot Act to pass a resolution reaffirming the Bill of Rights, and there were Democrats, there were Republicans, there were Libertarians.
[02:06:06.002 --> 02:06:09.823]  I spoke, Jim Hightower spoke, a former city council member
[02:06:10.621 --> 02:06:16.223]  George Humphrey spoke, current City Council member was there as well, the Mayor Pro Tem was there.
[02:06:17.104 --> 02:06:22.186]  Are they going to lose their lease because we had a meeting in a meeting hall?
[02:06:22.326 --> 02:06:24.567]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:06:25.627 --> 02:06:31.490]  But now they're discussing, see what the Feds did is in Seattle, they knew they were about to escalate the New World Order takeover.
[02:06:32.748 --> 02:06:37.696]  The federal government hired 50 thugs publicly, allowed them to burn trash cans and hit police with bottles.
[02:06:38.237 --> 02:06:41.383]  Then they retired to an armored police building to be protected.
[02:06:41.403 --> 02:06:43.145]  This is on the news, in the Takeover.
[02:06:43.165 --> 02:06:43.887]  We have it in my film.
[02:06:44.662 --> 02:06:45.422]  Police admitting it.
[02:06:45.862 --> 02:06:49.944]  Then the police attacked a peaceful 60,000 protesters and banned political protest.
[02:06:50.344 --> 02:06:52.264]  I have police saying no protest allowed.
[02:06:52.284 --> 02:06:58.306]  You can't even have an anti-WTO bumper sticker or pin because you saw what happened to our city.
[02:06:58.326 --> 02:06:59.206]  We're protecting the city.
[02:06:59.546 --> 02:07:01.567]  The feds control the provocateurs.
[02:07:02.187 --> 02:07:04.888]  So this is how they're going to ban all protests, whether it's pro-life,
[02:07:05.876 --> 02:07:06.317]  Thank you.
[02:07:27.682 --> 02:07:31.765]  Tell us exactly what happened here in Nazi Germany to you.
[02:07:32.006 --> 02:07:38.531]  Well, basically every year our union holds an International Women's Day celebration.
[02:07:40.132 --> 02:07:47.759]  And this year, because the war was imminent, we decided that we wanted to hold a peace march for our International Women's Day.
[02:07:48.599 --> 02:07:56.646]  And so we, you know, collected banners, had some signs, and there were about 40 to 50 people gathered at our office.
[02:07:57.645 --> 02:08:08.630]  We walked over to the San Mateo and I-40 overpass to hang our banners, and we also had about 500 balloons that had peace signs on them.
[02:08:09.971 --> 02:08:10.951]  We proceeded over.
[02:08:10.971 --> 02:08:19.515]  We were at the intersection for about three minutes, or actually for about 15 minutes before the police showed up.
[02:08:19.555 --> 02:08:21.936]  They tore our banners down, let our balloons go.
[02:08:23.471 --> 02:08:28.113]  We moved over to a different part of the intersection and then stayed there for about an hour.
[02:08:29.274 --> 02:08:33.175]  After that, it was probably about 5 o'clock at that point in time.
[02:08:34.356 --> 02:08:36.156]  We then went back to our office.
[02:08:36.797 --> 02:08:47.081]  The landlord was waiting there for us and basically accused us of being traitors and said that they supported Bush, they supported the war,
[02:08:48.602 --> 02:08:52.685]  And they were going to call the police to have our meeting shut down.
[02:08:54.167 --> 02:08:55.248]  The police arrived.
[02:08:56.149 --> 02:08:58.331]  They could find no disturbance taking place.
[02:08:59.572 --> 02:09:01.173]  They refused to shut our meeting down.
[02:09:01.914 --> 02:09:09.681]  But they did sit in the parking lot of our office complex until our meeting was over, until we had cleaned up.
[02:09:10.547 --> 02:09:19.453]  This is how it started in Russia, this is how it started in Germany, this is how it is in China, at Tiananmen Square, where you can't have a protest.
[02:09:19.473 --> 02:09:24.797]  Did you hear me read the part where the Deputy Attorney General in California says protesting may be terrorist?
[02:09:25.237 --> 02:09:26.818]  Right, exactly, exactly.
[02:09:27.258 --> 02:09:33.842]  And so the following week, you know, we were served with the eviction notice on May 2nd.
[02:09:34.363 --> 02:09:37.585]  We were evicted from our offices, given the day to move.
[02:09:39.295 --> 02:09:43.057]  Now, you've got witnesses of the landlord who said you're traitors.
[02:09:43.117 --> 02:09:46.898]  So clearly, this is discrimination.
[02:09:48.019 --> 02:09:50.040]  I hope you're going to sue.
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:51.480]  We are.
[02:09:51.540 --> 02:09:51.800]  Good.
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:57.463]  And on top of this, I'm sure you heard about the guy who was wearing the Give Peace a Chance shirt in the mall that he bought at the mall.
[02:09:57.483 --> 02:09:59.143]  Yeah, we found that very interesting as well.
[02:09:59.183 --> 02:10:00.164]  And now he was arrested.
[02:10:00.224 --> 02:10:04.666]  I mean, this is 180 degrees from what America is supposed to be about.
[02:10:04.686 --> 02:10:05.346]  Exactly.
[02:10:06.295 --> 02:10:08.836]  Exactly, that's true.
[02:10:09.557 --> 02:10:15.980]  Basically, our position is that we have every right to take a position and protest against the war.
[02:10:17.661 --> 02:10:21.523]  Demonstrating is patriotic and it's the right that we thought we had.
[02:10:22.071 --> 02:10:26.715]  Well, listen, under Bill Clinton, peaceful, pro-life demonstrators were beat up and tortured.
[02:10:27.035 --> 02:10:30.498]  So were environmental protesters, having the swabs in their eyes.
[02:10:30.838 --> 02:10:36.323]  Whether you're left-wing or right-wing, we've got to agree that we're allowed to have non-violent, peaceful demonstrations.
[02:10:36.723 --> 02:10:42.007]  And this new thing, where they say you're allowed to protest right here, then they go ahead and attack you anyways, like Portland.
[02:10:42.368 --> 02:10:43.328]  This is out of control.
[02:10:43.368 --> 02:10:44.249]  This is very frightening.
[02:10:44.529 --> 02:10:45.590]  Right, it is very frightening.
[02:10:45.630 --> 02:10:49.714]  And I don't know if you've been watching the miniseries on Hitler, but I think that
[02:10:50.393 --> 02:10:55.295]  You know, a lot of what happened back then is, we're seeing it before our eyes at this point in time as well.
[02:10:55.315 --> 02:10:59.036]  Well yeah, these people that say, I'm patriotic, you don't criticize Bush!
[02:10:59.676 --> 02:11:04.077]  I've gotten emails that, I'm calling to have you arrested, you're not allowed to criticize the war.
[02:11:04.537 --> 02:11:07.738]  And they have national talk show hosts saying this.
[02:11:08.579 --> 02:11:09.879]  They're really trying to push it.
[02:11:10.539 --> 02:11:11.500]  Yeah, they are.
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:15.961]  They're trying to quash free speech and they're trying to quash any kind of defense by accusing people.
[02:11:15.981 --> 02:11:18.022]  They're trying to kill the soul of America.
[02:11:18.422 --> 02:11:18.702]  They are.
[02:11:19.042 --> 02:11:19.402]  We agree.
[02:11:20.797 --> 02:11:23.279]  So, what has been the response in Albuquerque to this?
[02:11:24.039 --> 02:11:24.940]  People are outraged.
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:29.903]  We've gotten calls for support, and basically people are outraged.
[02:11:29.984 --> 02:11:38.930]  We've had several anti-war demonstrations, one in particular where protesters were tear gassed for no reason at all.
[02:11:38.950 --> 02:11:44.894]  Police later on said that the protesters were getting out of hand, throwing rocks, throwing bottles.
[02:11:45.687 --> 02:11:50.169]  Some of our members were there and basically were able to verify that none of that took place.
[02:11:50.349 --> 02:11:53.851]  But what they did is the feds carried out the stuff in Seattle.
[02:11:54.151 --> 02:12:02.275]  They show that as training video to all the local police as they issue the black uniforms and ski masks that are federally paid for, you know those Darth Vader outfits.
[02:12:02.495 --> 02:12:02.715]  Right.
[02:12:03.015 --> 02:12:05.537]  So this is all a big setup and I told people this years ago.
[02:12:06.297 --> 02:12:06.477]  Right.
[02:12:07.177 --> 02:12:10.019]  Right, it is and it's very scary and you know we're hoping that
[02:12:11.428 --> 02:12:17.231]  That people don't stop protesting, that people continue to exercise their rights under the Constitution.
[02:12:17.612 --> 02:12:19.713]  What did this landlord say to you?
[02:12:19.733 --> 02:12:21.454]  He said, you're a traitor, I'm going to call the police?
[02:12:22.034 --> 02:12:23.295]  Yes, he did.
[02:12:24.636 --> 02:12:31.140]  And basically said, you know, I'm a World War II veteran, I support Bush, I support the war, you should too.
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:36.303]  But wasn't he in World War II fighting governments that wouldn't allow protest?
[02:12:38.601 --> 02:12:39.141]  You would think.
[02:12:39.522 --> 02:12:41.222]  I'm not sure if he knew why he was there.
[02:12:43.524 --> 02:12:46.686]  Well, I mean, what is protesting going to do to his precious war?
[02:12:48.166 --> 02:12:48.547]  Stay there.
[02:12:48.627 --> 02:12:51.428]  One more segment to Eleanor Chavez, and then folks, I know you're holding.
[02:12:51.808 --> 02:12:56.611]  I'll get to your calls, and I'll get to all the news I haven't hit on yet, and believe me, there's a lot of it.
[02:12:57.992 --> 02:13:01.654]  Folks, the flag symbolizes the Bill of Rights, and if we don't have that, we have nothing.
[02:13:02.979 --> 02:13:06.602]  And, uh, you know, I don't agree with the politics of International Women's Day and the U.N.
[02:13:06.622 --> 02:13:12.787]  and the rest of it, because it's controlled by the same bankers that control the right wing, but I will fight to the death to defend their right to protest.
[02:13:13.027 --> 02:13:13.668]  I'll be right back.
[02:13:15.553 --> 02:13:19.455]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[02:13:19.675 --> 02:13:25.118]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:13:25.399 --> 02:13:35.764]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:13:35.925 --> 02:13:40.267]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:13:40.467 --> 02:13:48.813]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:13:49.093 --> 02:13:55.477]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and final taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[02:14:31.088 --> 02:14:31.829]  How do you fight back?

[02:14:58.570 --> 02:14:58.910]  I think?
[02:15:15.286 --> 02:15:20.190]  Can you imagine how hard it would be to drive across the country without a roadmap, and how easy it would be to get lost?
[02:15:20.490 --> 02:15:21.871]  Navigating through the world of U.S.
[02:15:21.891 --> 02:15:24.232]  gold and silver coins can be equally as challenging.
[02:15:24.673 --> 02:15:27.515]  Fortunately, there is a roadmap to guide you through the maze of U.S.
[02:15:27.555 --> 02:15:27.915]  coins.
[02:15:28.155 --> 02:15:29.396]  The Redbook Guide to U.S.
[02:15:29.456 --> 02:15:35.000]  Coins and History provides you with the knowledge you'll need to make informed decisions when it comes to collecting and investing in U.S.
[02:15:35.040 --> 02:15:35.980]  gold and silver coins.

[02:15:38.402 --> 02:15:39.062]  A guide to U.S.

[02:16:14.250 --> 02:16:15.250]  Jim, I'm worried.
[02:16:15.750 --> 02:16:17.230]  You don't have enough life insurance.
[02:16:17.471 --> 02:16:19.271]  How would the kids and I get by without you?
[02:16:19.531 --> 02:16:21.972]  I know, but it's such a hassle finding the best rates.
[02:16:22.212 --> 02:16:25.293]  You know, I talked to Sue Carter and she told me about BestQuote.
[02:16:25.673 --> 02:16:30.114]  Bob actually doubled his coverage with a leading insurance company without paying a penny more.
[02:16:30.134 --> 02:16:30.594]  Really?
[02:16:30.774 --> 02:16:31.594]  But what's the catch?
[02:16:31.634 --> 02:16:32.134]  No catch.
[02:16:32.474 --> 02:16:34.195]  You just call them for free quotes in the mail.
[02:16:34.375 --> 02:16:36.175]  No salesman ever contacts you.
[02:16:36.235 --> 02:16:37.475]  I've heard rates are coming down.
[02:16:37.555 --> 02:16:37.915]  You know what?
[02:16:37.995 --> 02:16:38.855]  I'll call Best Quote.
[02:16:39.156 --> 02:16:39.616]  That's right.
[02:16:39.696 --> 02:16:41.896]  You can save up to 70% on your premiums.
[02:16:42.056 --> 02:16:47.777]  For instance, a 35 year old non-smoking male can get a quarter million dollars of coverage for less than $12 a month.
[02:16:48.077 --> 02:16:49.497]  Guaranteed for 10 years.
[02:16:49.897 --> 02:16:50.518]  Honey, you were right.
[02:16:50.678 --> 02:16:53.638]  Best Quote got us a lot more insurance and we're paying less per month.
[02:16:53.798 --> 02:16:55.238]  Thanks for taking care of us, Jim.
[02:16:55.418 --> 02:16:57.079]  I can't believe I put it off for so long.
[02:16:57.259 --> 02:16:58.439]  Best Quote made it so easy.
[02:16:58.679 --> 02:16:58.960]  Easy.
[02:16:59.020 --> 02:16:59.220]  Got 1-800-690-8893.
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:16:59.300]  1-800-690-8893.
[02:16:59.361 --> 02:16:59.561]  That's 1-800-690-8893.
[02:17:23.003 --> 02:17:31.932]  Folks, whether it's the left-wing in California saying you may be terrorists if you protest to the right-wing running D.C., there is no difference.
[02:17:31.992 --> 02:17:33.073]  Government's exploding.
[02:17:33.193 --> 02:17:34.915]  Our borders are disappearing.
[02:17:34.955 --> 02:17:36.016]  Internationalism.
[02:17:36.776 --> 02:17:39.279]  There isn't a choice between left-wing or right-wing world government.
[02:17:39.299 --> 02:17:40.500]  We don't want world government.
[02:17:41.249 --> 02:17:46.173]  They're going to shut down your free speech, whether it's liberal Germany or conservative Texas.
[02:17:46.653 --> 02:17:50.636]  We've got to stand firmly against this and recognize the provocateurs they're hiring as well.
[02:17:51.277 --> 02:17:55.160]  What are you suing the landlord for?
[02:17:56.261 --> 02:18:03.566]  Again, we're talking to Eleanor Chavez, the head of the local medical workers union that had a protest and so they were evicted.
[02:18:04.267 --> 02:18:05.508]  What are you suing for, Eleanor?
[02:18:06.627 --> 02:18:12.468]  Well, basically, we'll be suing, and I don't know that this is a legal term, but for wrongful eviction.
[02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:22.991]  And we'll also be suing to recover all of the expenses and damages that were caused as a result of the eviction.
[02:18:23.911 --> 02:18:30.813]  I don't know if anybody's ever tried to move in a day or, you know, get your phone system set up in a day.
[02:18:31.966 --> 02:18:34.828]  Pretty incredible thing to have to go through.
[02:18:34.988 --> 02:18:41.493]  Well, did anybody say to this guy or gal, this guy, why are you doing this?
[02:18:42.094 --> 02:18:52.721]  It was very clear in the summons that we received for our eviction that he was doing it because of the anti-war demonstration that we held.
[02:18:55.684 --> 02:18:58.826]  So he thinks that's not allowed or something?
[02:18:58.926 --> 02:19:00.227]  According to him, it isn't allowed.
[02:19:03.138 --> 02:19:07.642]  So, you know, once we get to hearing, um, everything will be fleshed out.
[02:19:07.682 --> 02:19:17.951]  But yeah, according to him, and I think that the other piece of it is, is that, you know, we're living under times that, um, you know, this kind of thing is, is seen as permissible.
[02:19:18.592 --> 02:19:24.817]  Um, and so he took every liberty to, um, take advantage of the political times that we're living in.
[02:19:25.197 --> 02:19:27.920]  So he thinks that he fought in World War II, so...
[02:19:28.934 --> 02:19:32.557]  He could throw people out because they had a protest down the street at a union.
[02:19:32.597 --> 02:19:33.817]  What do you expect unions to do?
[02:19:33.837 --> 02:19:38.921]  And we live in a time where the Pentagon spies on the American people.
[02:19:38.961 --> 02:19:47.487]  And we live in a time where they arrest a lawyer at a mall five minutes after he buys a shirt that says, Peace on Earth.
[02:19:48.187 --> 02:19:51.429]  Freedom is about arresting people who have Peace on Earth on their shirts.
[02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:56.032]  Well, yeah, and I think, you know, they're seizing on the opportunity.
[02:19:57.512 --> 02:20:08.499]  You know, to basically excuse anyone who has a different opinion to really quash them and to really say you don't have any right to free speech unless your opinion agrees with mine.
[02:20:09.219 --> 02:20:10.520]  I wonder why he likes Bush.
[02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:14.722]  I'd imagine he's a conservative, probably a nice guy, just is blinded by all this propaganda.
[02:20:14.762 --> 02:20:17.644]  I mean, Bush is going to reassert Clinton's gun ban.
[02:20:18.145 --> 02:20:20.746]  He's going to add a semi-automatic shotgun ban.
[02:20:21.426 --> 02:20:25.369]  Bush gave all the supercomputers to Communist China when Clinton only gave some.
[02:20:26.361 --> 02:20:29.703]  Uh, Bush is blocking down Burton's Committee, investigating Pardongate.
[02:20:30.323 --> 02:20:38.568]  I mean, these people that love Bush, these so-called conservatives, I wish they'd wake up and figure out that Bush isn't a conservative, he isn't a liberal, he's a command-and-control thug.
[02:20:38.608 --> 02:20:45.112]  Exactly, and I think the other question that people need to begin raising again really is, you know, how did Bush get into office?
[02:20:45.172 --> 02:20:48.634]  And it wasn't a fair election, it was really an election that was stolen.
[02:20:48.654 --> 02:20:51.916]  So the question is, you know, is he really an elected president?
[02:20:52.478 --> 02:21:07.928]  Well, clearly he's not, and you know, I think things would be the same now if Al Gore was in there, but obviously this is a staged event, and him and his CIA daddy are... There's a trillion dollars missing from the Pentagon, Eleanor.
[02:21:07.948 --> 02:21:10.870]  I wasn't aware of that.
[02:21:11.190 --> 02:21:13.912]  Oh yeah, it was the San Francisco Chronicle a few days ago.
[02:21:13.932 --> 02:21:16.073]  I mean, it's just the looting of the government.
[02:21:16.514 --> 02:21:18.355]  This is corruption I've never seen.
[02:21:18.375 --> 02:21:20.016]  I mean, this is off the chart.
[02:21:21.695 --> 02:21:24.237]  And it's money taken from us, really, because we're the ones.
[02:21:24.397 --> 02:21:25.658]  I mean, that's where our tax dollars go.
[02:21:25.678 --> 02:21:29.161]  Have you heard they're going to take the veterans' health care above 65?
[02:21:29.281 --> 02:21:30.962]  I'm sure he'll love that.
[02:21:31.282 --> 02:21:33.744]  They're changing the pension rules to take the pensions?
[02:21:34.244 --> 02:21:34.424]  Right.
[02:21:35.065 --> 02:21:39.168]  I mean, I wonder why this... I'd like to have a talk with this guy.
[02:21:39.208 --> 02:21:41.069]  I think he's a useful idiot.
[02:21:41.089 --> 02:21:42.170]  I don't think he's evil.
[02:21:42.230 --> 02:21:43.090]  I think he's ignorant.
[02:21:43.791 --> 02:21:44.291]  I would agree.
[02:21:44.311 --> 02:21:48.855]  And I think that most people, you know, don't ask enough questions.
[02:21:48.955 --> 02:21:50.796]  And really, I think that we need to look at
[02:21:51.243 --> 02:21:58.405]  You know, how educational systems are set up, because in this country, you know, students are not thought to think independently and critically.
[02:21:58.445 --> 02:22:04.147]  They're really, you know, fed, you know, a government line, if you will.
[02:22:04.827 --> 02:22:08.828]  And, you know, they're taught to accept what the government says.
[02:22:08.888 --> 02:22:09.368]  Exactly.
[02:22:09.408 --> 02:22:17.750]  They're taught to not be questioning, write the wrong thing in an essay, you get arrested, learn how to be a little prisoner for the Wackenhut prison grid.
[02:22:18.090 --> 02:22:20.451]  Do you guys have a website for folks that want to learn more?
[02:22:22.294 --> 02:22:25.555]  Actually, we're having a little bit of trouble with our website.
[02:22:25.915 --> 02:22:30.397]  What we do is nmhospitalworkers.com.
[02:22:30.417 --> 02:22:31.717]  nmhospitalworkers.com.
[02:22:31.757 --> 02:22:39.740]  And what about a phone number for folks that want to get in touch with you in Albuquerque who aren't involved with unions but are involved with the First Amendment?
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:43.241]  In Albuquerque, our number is Area Code 505-884-7713.
[02:22:43.261 --> 02:22:44.221]  That number again, please.
[02:22:50.993 --> 02:22:56.779]  It's area code 505-884-7713.
[02:22:56.979 --> 02:23:00.102]  Alright, Eleanor Chavez, thanks for standing up for the First Amendment.
[02:23:00.122 --> 02:23:00.703]  I support you 110%.
[02:23:01.424 --> 02:23:01.984]  Take care.
[02:23:02.405 --> 02:23:03.145]  I'll be right back.
[02:23:05.808 --> 02:23:06.729]  We're on the march.
[02:23:07.210 --> 02:23:08.851]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:23:09.732 --> 02:23:12.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:14.185 --> 02:23:17.809]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronizer.
[02:23:17.970 --> 02:23:22.355]  Air purifier is not a filter and there are no messy plates to clean or replace.
[02:23:22.555 --> 02:23:26.640]  The Aeronizer produces high levels of activated oxygen from the oxygen pipe 1912.
[02:23:26.740 --> 02:23:28.142]  That's 800-255-1912 or visit arcinstitute.com
[02:23:41.497 --> 02:23:52.226]  We talk about the real world, how things really work.
[02:23:52.746 --> 02:23:59.232]  Why we can't get anything changed or done is because the left and right are controlled and in dead ends.
[02:24:00.373 --> 02:24:01.954]  They co-op our movements.
[02:24:02.715 --> 02:24:08.440]  We've got to get back to the Bill of Rights and Constitution and this move by the liberals and the conservatives
[02:24:09.309 --> 02:24:14.834]  Some of the liberal cities are the worst, banning anti-war protests, beating people up, you name it.
[02:24:15.394 --> 02:24:17.416]  It shows that the elite want war.
[02:24:17.496 --> 02:24:20.178]  By the way, there was a Times of Asia story about the Bilderberg Group.
[02:24:20.218 --> 02:24:20.979]  That's coming up.
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:25.303]  And I am scheduled to have Big Jim Tucker on from American Free Press.
[02:24:26.303 --> 02:24:28.725]  Right now, let's go back to the calls you've been holding patiently.
[02:24:29.726 --> 02:24:36.052]  Let's talk to Ralph in Illinois, then Dwayne, Curtis, Joan and others.
[02:24:36.272 --> 02:24:37.213]  Ralph, you're on the air.
[02:24:37.253 --> 02:24:37.613]  Go ahead.
[02:24:38.294 --> 02:24:39.054]  Yeah, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:24:39.374 --> 02:24:39.854]  Fine, sir.
[02:24:40.695 --> 02:24:44.755]  I just want to let you know that I have all four hours of that Hitler Special on tape.
[02:24:44.795 --> 02:24:45.616]  I could send it to you.
[02:24:46.716 --> 02:24:47.796]  Well, I would appreciate that.
[02:24:48.336 --> 02:24:49.356]  Yeah, that was no problem.
[02:24:49.436 --> 02:24:54.858]  I had to work, and it was something that I wanted to see, and I had taped the first two hours and taped the next two hours.
[02:24:54.918 --> 02:25:00.079]  I haven't even watched the second half yet, but it sounds interesting from the other callers.
[02:25:00.599 --> 02:25:03.259]  But I'm going to watch it, and I'll send that thing out to you tomorrow.
[02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:06.200]  And you can go ahead and check it out.
[02:25:07.171 --> 02:25:08.232]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:25:08.712 --> 02:25:09.252]  And no problem.
[02:25:09.693 --> 02:25:10.353]  Keep up the great work.
[02:25:10.373 --> 02:25:11.333]  That's all I wanted to call for.
[02:25:11.353 --> 02:25:16.576]  I've been listening, and if I listen in the afternoon, if I can't hear you in the afternoon, I'll listen to you in the evening.
[02:25:17.057 --> 02:25:18.598]  I'm always keeping going here.
[02:25:18.798 --> 02:25:20.218]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:25:20.238 --> 02:25:22.620]  I appreciate your listenership, and please spread the word.
[02:25:22.660 --> 02:25:26.782]  It is so important, because I know that we're doing a pretty good job here.
[02:25:26.802 --> 02:25:27.763]  We have great guests on.
[02:25:27.783 --> 02:25:29.624]  We cover real issues that affect everybody.
[02:25:30.044 --> 02:25:31.745]  Not issues of little or no significance.
[02:25:31.825 --> 02:25:33.386]  Not the PAP and manipulation.
[02:25:34.637 --> 02:25:44.784]  And I would hope that the millions of listeners we have will tell millions of other people in their area, whether it's satellite, shortwave, internet, or AM or FM.
[02:25:44.884 --> 02:25:51.908]  However people listen, somebody's going to have a shortwave, or the internet, or satellite, or a local AM or FM.
[02:25:52.068 --> 02:25:54.510]  And support our local AM and FM's.
[02:25:54.570 --> 02:25:55.951]  Tell their sponsors thank you.
[02:25:56.971 --> 02:25:57.952]  Buy their products.
[02:25:58.012 --> 02:25:59.553]  Spread the word about the show.
[02:26:00.529 --> 02:26:04.850]  If you're listening on satellite, internet, or shortwave, call your local AM and FM stations.
[02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:07.790]  Tell them to pick up the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:07.850 --> 02:26:08.831]  It's really working.
[02:26:09.371 --> 02:26:12.991]  A lot of good conservative Americans know something's wrong with Bush.
[02:26:13.171 --> 02:26:13.951]  They tune in.
[02:26:14.372 --> 02:26:15.272]  They hear of the show.
[02:26:15.292 --> 02:26:17.072]  I'm talking about station owners and managers.
[02:26:17.512 --> 02:26:18.972]  They put the show on.
[02:26:20.313 --> 02:26:22.413]  Because they love the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:26:22.453 --> 02:26:24.834]  They're not sucked in by Bill Clinton or George Bush.
[02:26:25.794 --> 02:26:27.254]  We're getting a lot of new affiliates.
[02:26:28.163 --> 02:26:39.789]  But still, the way you have this media consolidation, a lot of affiliates get bought and go to Espanol, go to Spanish, or go to all sports to pump out the propaganda of the New World Order.
[02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:46.712]  Just mindless pap from the rock and roll to the sports, to you name it.
[02:26:46.872 --> 02:26:49.914]  And it is really important to spread the word about this broadcast.
[02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:53.951]  This show is here nine hours a day.
[02:26:54.311 --> 02:26:55.932]  We're here from 11 a.m.
[02:26:56.132 --> 02:26:57.192]  until 2 p.m.
[02:26:57.432 --> 02:27:04.535]  Central Standard Time during the day, then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, and the daytime show rebroadcast from 1 a.m.
[02:27:04.655 --> 02:27:05.716]  until 4 a.m.
[02:27:06.196 --> 02:27:07.216]  Central Standard Time.
[02:27:07.256 --> 02:27:09.657]  That's nine hours a day.
[02:27:09.757 --> 02:27:16.820]  No matter what schedule you're on, where you work, what you're doing, you should be able to tune in to all or part of the broadcast.
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:19.081]  So, really appreciate the network.
[02:27:20.268 --> 02:27:27.314]  Supporting the show, not censoring the show, supporting what we're doing and all the sponsors and everybody else, because the show is, the broadcast is really growing.
[02:27:28.715 --> 02:27:29.976]  Who is up next here?
[02:27:31.898 --> 02:27:33.639]  Ralph in Illinois.
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:38.803]  Okay, I thought we just went to Ralph in Illinois, but Ralph in Illinois, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:27:42.146 --> 02:27:44.808]  I'm not sure even who I'm talking to, it's kind of all over the board right now.
[02:27:44.828 --> 02:27:45.609]  This is Ralph.
[02:27:45.929 --> 02:27:46.870]  Okay, Ralph, go ahead.
[02:27:47.355 --> 02:27:49.277]  Yeah, I just talked to you about the tape.
[02:27:49.897 --> 02:27:51.338]  The Hitler program that was on the four hours.
[02:27:51.358 --> 02:27:51.679]  That's right.
[02:27:51.699 --> 02:27:52.359]  You've been holding.
[02:27:52.399 --> 02:27:53.380]  I told you to hold earlier.
[02:27:53.420 --> 02:27:53.760]  Go ahead.
[02:27:54.061 --> 02:27:54.341]  Yeah.
[02:27:54.621 --> 02:27:57.223]  I was just letting you know that I'll bail out that tape for you.
[02:27:57.243 --> 02:27:58.484]  I've got the four hours and everything.
[02:27:59.085 --> 02:28:02.628]  And I didn't get a chance to watch the second half of it, though, but I heard it.
[02:28:02.648 --> 02:28:02.808]  Oh, I see.
[02:28:02.848 --> 02:28:05.310]  I said thanks for the call and then you didn't get disconnected.
[02:28:05.550 --> 02:28:06.211]  I understand now.
[02:28:07.472 --> 02:28:07.772]  Okay.
[02:28:07.812 --> 02:28:08.433]  Thank you, sir.
[02:28:08.493 --> 02:28:09.333]  I appreciate that.
[02:28:09.534 --> 02:28:10.094]  I really do.
[02:28:10.114 --> 02:28:13.497]  I'll keep taking calls here, folks.
[02:28:14.804 --> 02:28:20.067]  I guess the next person would be, who would that be?
[02:28:22.228 --> 02:28:24.389]  Curtis in Louisiana, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:28:24.709 --> 02:28:27.611]  Hey Alex, I want to make two points.
[02:28:27.671 --> 02:28:30.372]  The first point is about Mind Control.
[02:28:30.432 --> 02:28:37.656]  I think the name of this group is called National Society and they were showing on MSNBC where they had two games.
[02:28:37.796 --> 02:28:43.559]  One was called Ethnic Cleansing and one was called White Law and on both of them you're
[02:28:44.153 --> 02:28:45.194]  Well, I'm familiar with the games.
[02:28:45.394 --> 02:28:51.659]  I've seen the website and the group argues they can do that because the other video games, you target police officers, you target innocent people,
[02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:21.013]  There's a game called Dungeon Keeper where you kidnap the good people and torture them to death because you're a demon and you get power out of it and build your armies.
[02:29:22.373 --> 02:29:31.198]  I am not for censoring that game, though I find it disgusting, because if you do censor that game, they're going to censor everything else.
[02:29:31.218 --> 02:29:42.584]  I do think that it should be labeled and people should self-censor and keep their children away from that type of stuff, but it's a knockoff of other games that are put out by the big distributors
[02:29:43.337 --> 02:30:03.067]  And I have seen some of the screenshots of it, and you do go around and do this, and did you know that the white supremacists are controlled by the government, and actually by the political Zionists, who want to then demonize any group that stands up for their race.
[02:30:03.507 --> 02:30:09.510]  They balkanize and radicalize this whole debate to where they're the only group that are allowed to engage in racism.
[02:30:10.333 --> 02:30:16.695]  No, I didn't know that, and I don't think it should be censored either, but I was just saying that that is a form of mind control, you know?
[02:30:16.975 --> 02:30:17.976]  Oh, it is mind control.
[02:30:17.996 --> 02:30:24.738]  Look, they found that when you play these games, you go out and you shoot and kill people, that it desensitizes you to the violence.
[02:30:24.778 --> 02:30:25.739]  It's all disgusting.
[02:30:26.419 --> 02:30:26.839]  Exactly.
[02:30:27.059 --> 02:30:32.821]  Now, I've seen the game, and all that's going to do is create more racism on the other side.
[02:30:33.201 --> 02:30:37.143]  See, what happens is you have racist black people, racist white people, racist Hispanics,
[02:30:38.061 --> 02:30:39.302]  People that don't like each other.
[02:30:39.322 --> 02:30:43.824]  And they may have good reasons sometimes because the person from the other race was mean to them.
[02:30:44.424 --> 02:30:45.845]  But it's just a cycle.
[02:30:45.965 --> 02:30:47.946]  It expands it and accelerates it.
[02:30:48.466 --> 02:30:53.348]  I want to look at the cause of it, what is promoting it, and at the root, it's actually the government doing it.
[02:30:53.868 --> 02:30:54.389]  Exactly.
[02:30:54.749 --> 02:31:03.633]  And the second point I wanted to make real quick was, you know, a lot of the stuff that we're living in and you talk about now is in the Bible.
[02:31:06.016 --> 02:31:13.342]  And then a lot of people might say, well, there's really not much that we can do about what's happening because God said it was going to happen.
[02:31:13.362 --> 02:31:19.747]  The only thing we can do is just pray and, you know, let people know and hopefully that, you know, we go to heaven and stuff.
[02:31:19.967 --> 02:31:21.128]  What do you think about that?
[02:31:22.389 --> 02:31:24.331]  Well, we're charged to warn people.
[02:31:24.411 --> 02:31:26.792]  We're charged to suffer the little children to protect them.
[02:31:26.833 --> 02:31:28.534]  We're charged to fight corruption.
[02:31:29.254 --> 02:31:32.257]  We're charged to stand up against the works of darkness and reprove them.
[02:31:33.397 --> 02:31:53.330]  And you look at what the apostles did, you look at what Jesus did, standing up to corruption, the money changers, you look at what our charge is to stand up against evil, and then we see the prophets being sent to countries and telling them, repent, and when they did repent, they'd be given a reprieve, in one case for a hundred years.
[02:31:53.410 --> 02:32:00.875]  So, this wouldn't be happening, things wouldn't be degenerating, if we didn't have this corrupt global government
[02:32:01.868 --> 02:32:05.311]  Promoting the destruction and the degeneration of our morals and society.
[02:32:07.053 --> 02:32:11.997]  Exactly, because I was hearing that guy, I forgot his name, he's from Waxahachie, Texas.
[02:32:12.658 --> 02:32:13.399]  His name is David.
[02:32:13.759 --> 02:32:16.001]  David J. Smith, Waxahachie, Texas, yes.
[02:32:16.261 --> 02:32:27.491]  Yeah, and he was saying, you know, it's a new world order and there's not much that we can do about it because, you know, it's in the Bible and I was just, you know, that's what a lot of people think, you know, they think, well, it's in the Bible and
[02:32:28.654 --> 02:32:36.524]  Certainly bad things happen, bad things are going to happen, but we have a job to warn people and wake folks up and we can do something about that.
[02:32:37.609 --> 02:32:43.174]  And at the same time, you know, people thought that Hitler was the Antichrist and you can't fight him at the end of the world.
[02:32:43.514 --> 02:32:44.695]  Some of the Christians thought that.
[02:32:44.975 --> 02:32:46.237]  They thought Stalin was.
[02:32:46.277 --> 02:32:47.458]  They thought Mao was.
[02:32:47.978 --> 02:32:53.223]  So every thug that comes along, the churches are being paid off not to speak out and fight it.
[02:32:53.303 --> 02:32:54.644]  I'm not saying David J. Smith's doing that.
[02:32:54.664 --> 02:32:55.364]  He's a good guy.
[02:32:55.885 --> 02:32:57.326]  I'm talking about the big establishment 501c3s.
[02:32:59.366 --> 02:32:59.866]  Exactly.
[02:32:59.906 --> 02:33:04.788]  Well, okay, um, I, oh yeah, the comment I was going to make yesterday, real quick about the OnStar.
[02:33:05.328 --> 02:33:11.491]  I think that's, um, part of the satellite thing, because they say if you have a wreck or something, your airbag deploys and they don't get you.
[02:33:11.811 --> 02:33:13.532]  They can send somebody to your location.
[02:33:13.592 --> 02:33:17.113]  So, people that have that, they probably already got the box in their car.
[02:33:17.173 --> 02:33:17.933]  Well, of course they do.
[02:33:18.153 --> 02:33:22.315]  All new Chevrolet vehicles have OnStar in them standard.
[02:33:22.875 --> 02:33:25.776]  You can request to have the interface removed out of your car.
[02:33:26.417 --> 02:33:27.457]  So it's already here, sir.
[02:33:28.104 --> 02:33:28.504]  Exactly.
[02:33:28.544 --> 02:33:29.344]  Well, I appreciate it.
[02:33:29.364 --> 02:33:30.225]  You keep up the good work.
[02:33:30.585 --> 02:33:32.505]  Thank you, Curtis, for the call.
[02:33:32.605 --> 02:33:34.306]  Sorry, I got the calls confused earlier.
[02:33:34.626 --> 02:33:35.886]  My writing isn't the best here.
[02:33:36.326 --> 02:33:37.507]  I'm down in Austin, Texas.
[02:33:37.587 --> 02:33:38.347]  They're up in Minnesota.
[02:33:38.367 --> 02:33:41.828]  They told me who the callers are, and I, half the time, don't write it down right.
[02:33:42.548 --> 02:33:44.288]  Let's talk to Dwayne in Texas.
[02:33:44.328 --> 02:33:45.429]  Dwayne, you're on the air.
[02:33:45.469 --> 02:33:45.909]  Go ahead.
[02:33:45.929 --> 02:33:47.469]  Hello, Alex.
[02:33:47.509 --> 02:33:49.230]  Appreciate your time.
[02:33:49.770 --> 02:33:51.670]  And the name is Wayne.
[02:33:52.251 --> 02:33:53.671]  Not D-Wayne, but Wayne.
[02:33:55.177 --> 02:33:58.839]  And, uh, I was just checking to see if you have gotten my letter.
[02:33:59.979 --> 02:34:04.982]  And I think you'll recognize it because it had the Texas flag on the envelope and on the letterhead.
[02:34:05.002 --> 02:34:07.022]  Yeah, I've got your letter.
[02:34:07.283 --> 02:34:07.603]  Good.
[02:34:07.663 --> 02:34:09.484]  I need a fax number from you.
[02:34:09.744 --> 02:34:12.045]  Not over the air, but you can fax my fax.
[02:34:12.765 --> 02:34:16.367]  Well, sir, I don't know if I can, you know, I barely have time to read these letters.
[02:34:16.587 --> 02:34:17.127]  I understand.
[02:34:17.147 --> 02:34:18.247]  Much less respond to them.
[02:34:18.688 --> 02:34:19.268]  I understand.
[02:34:19.761 --> 02:34:20.722]  What's on your mind, sir?
[02:34:21.122 --> 02:34:28.528]  I just received a letter from the Republican National Committee wanting my opinions.
[02:34:29.889 --> 02:34:34.053]  I answered their questionnaire, and then I'm sending them a three-page letter of my opinions.
[02:34:34.313 --> 02:34:36.174]  Yes, and what are your opinions?
[02:34:36.635 --> 02:34:46.783]  Well, my opinions are that the only way we're going to beat this system is to start small, and for Texas to start the process for secession.
[02:34:48.874 --> 02:34:54.297]  But to do that, we can't have 14 fruitcakes pop up and claim themselves Presidents of Texas.
[02:34:54.757 --> 02:34:59.459]  We have to start the process of educating people that Texas could remove itself from the Union.
[02:35:00.059 --> 02:35:09.303]  And I think having some states break off would be a good idea to send a message to the globalists, because this isn't the United States government anymore, it's a New World Order engine.
[02:35:09.343 --> 02:35:10.804]  That's what our country's been turned into.
[02:35:11.204 --> 02:35:17.087]  Exactly, and the Texas Constitution says it is inferior to the national
[02:35:18.353 --> 02:35:20.614]  Absolutely, also what's happening is we see
[02:35:40.530 --> 02:35:51.296]  Other government agencies and other government institutions lobbying for the passage of laws all over the country, destroying the Bill of Rights and Constitution at their state level.
[02:35:51.416 --> 02:35:53.757]  So it's a very serious development.
[02:35:54.257 --> 02:35:54.877]  Absolutely.
[02:35:54.918 --> 02:35:57.759]  And I've been with you since Police State 1 and before.
[02:35:58.659 --> 02:35:59.980]  And I have most of your tapes.
[02:36:00.340 --> 02:36:01.921]  Well, Wayne, I really appreciate your service.
[02:36:01.941 --> 02:36:07.404]  The gentleman ahead of me stole my thunder because I have an unedited version.
[02:36:07.424 --> 02:36:09.345]  I haven't taken the commercials out.
[02:36:09.887 --> 02:36:14.250]  On that Hitler Series, and I can mail that to you also.
[02:36:14.691 --> 02:36:16.872]  And I'm in Houston, so you'll probably get it sooner.
[02:36:16.913 --> 02:36:17.493]  I'll have to copy it.
[02:36:17.513 --> 02:36:19.775]  Well, the big thing is, I need an SP version.
[02:36:20.876 --> 02:36:24.378]  Just please don't, you know, folks, make me an LP copy of a copy.
[02:36:24.398 --> 02:36:25.379]  I don't care if it's edited.
[02:36:25.399 --> 02:36:28.361]  You can just make me a straight copy or keep the copy and send me the original.
[02:36:28.742 --> 02:36:30.223]  Well, it's in six-hour format.
[02:36:30.923 --> 02:36:31.264]  Pardon me?
[02:36:31.444 --> 02:36:34.226]  It's on one videotape, all four hours.
[02:36:35.616 --> 02:36:41.399]  Then I'd probably need the original or I couldn't use it because once you go to EP or LP and then make another copy, it just degradates.
[02:36:41.779 --> 02:36:42.159]  Okay.
[02:36:42.620 --> 02:36:47.082]  I'll give you the original that I made and I will make a backup copy for myself.
[02:36:47.262 --> 02:36:48.283]  Well, I appreciate that.
[02:36:48.543 --> 02:36:51.824]  And I appreciate you listening to the show for a long time.
[02:36:51.904 --> 02:36:55.926]  Things have certainly gone downhill, but in many respects, things have gotten better.
[02:36:55.946 --> 02:36:57.067]  A lot of people have woken up.
[02:36:59.545 --> 02:37:00.626]  And we've freed a lot of minds.
[02:37:00.726 --> 02:37:01.787]  Wayne, thank you for the call.
[02:37:02.227 --> 02:37:03.648]  I really appreciate it.
[02:37:03.708 --> 02:37:04.609]  Joan in Florida.
[02:37:04.669 --> 02:37:05.509]  Joan, you're on the air.
[02:37:05.569 --> 02:37:05.990]  Go ahead.
[02:37:06.230 --> 02:37:07.351]  Hi, Alex.
[02:37:07.411 --> 02:37:08.451]  Joni Callahan here.
[02:37:10.413 --> 02:37:17.238]  Today in the Congress, this afternoon, they passed H.R.
[02:37:17.258 --> 02:37:17.238]  1170.
[02:37:18.218 --> 02:37:20.040]  Ron Paul was one of the sponsors.
[02:37:20.120 --> 02:37:24.142]  I called his office to find out how this was truly a good bill.
[02:37:24.763 --> 02:37:29.126]  It stopped schools from requiring a child to have prescription drugs
[02:37:29.721 --> 02:37:30.662]  We're good to go.
[02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:45.645]  So, you know, I know people that have been told that they don't keep their child on Ritalin or one of the other drugs.
[02:37:45.925 --> 02:37:55.773]  Oh yeah, they got school principals and teachers as doctors ordering children on Ritalin and Prozac, and it's now like 10 million kids on prescription drugs that are mind-altering.
[02:37:55.813 --> 02:37:58.375]  Ritalin, Prozac, Luvox, all that stuff.
[02:37:58.475 --> 02:37:59.015]  It's horrible.
[02:37:59.075 --> 02:38:00.657]  It's like Brave New World.
[02:38:01.037 --> 02:38:05.741]  Well, this was a very good vote, a very short bill, direct to the point.
[02:38:07.679 --> 02:38:12.042]  The vote was 425 in favor of the bill, one opposed to it.
[02:38:12.582 --> 02:38:15.784]  The thing is, there is no companion Senate bill.
[02:38:16.365 --> 02:38:19.167]  Oh yeah, and I bet Monty Bush wouldn't sign that.
[02:38:19.547 --> 02:38:26.351]  So, and then the other thing, you have to get a pass the President, and then you need to get your state to enforce the ban.
[02:38:26.551 --> 02:38:29.293]  But, I think... Well, parents should just know their rights.
[02:38:29.313 --> 02:38:30.954]  You don't have to give your kid vaccines.
[02:38:30.994 --> 02:38:33.076]  You don't have to put them on all these deadly drugs.
[02:38:33.616 --> 02:38:36.418]  It's just a fact, and I appreciate the call, Johnny.
[02:38:37.068 --> 02:38:37.768]  Good to hear from you.
[02:38:37.788 --> 02:38:42.151]  Let me plug my videos right now, then we'll come back and I'll hit some of the news we haven't gotten to.
[02:38:42.191 --> 02:38:44.072]  Believe me, you want to stay with us because it's very interesting.
[02:38:44.732 --> 02:38:45.793]  I appreciate all the calls.
[02:38:45.853 --> 02:38:46.933]  Sorry no more time for calls.
[02:38:46.973 --> 02:38:49.494]  You're down to the last ten minutes of the show now.
[02:38:49.514 --> 02:38:55.397]  I have now produced Police State 3 Total Enslavement, the greatest evil that mankind has ever faced.
[02:38:55.818 --> 02:39:00.660]  It's among us, a scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn in slavery, man, woman, and child.
[02:39:00.700 --> 02:39:05.923]  The United States government at all levels has fallen under the control of the desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[02:39:06.483 --> 02:39:18.949]  The events of September 11th mark the initiation of the final sick push of the Illuminati to consolidate their One World Order and transform Earth into a prison planet in over two and a half hours, two hours and thirty-seven minutes to be exact.
[02:39:19.469 --> 02:39:26.732]  I chronicle in stunning detail the true character of the globalist master plan, again.
[02:39:27.913 --> 02:39:30.494]  Stunning detail, the true character of the globalists.
[02:39:31.090 --> 02:39:37.895]  Learn the master plan of the bloodthirsty elite who financially, physically, and spiritually imprison not only America, but the world.
[02:39:38.296 --> 02:39:46.182]  Total Enslavement is the third installment in my award-winning, critically acclaimed Police States series, and is a must-see for all who love freedom.
[02:39:46.222 --> 02:39:49.985]  This film documents the nightmare rise of the Homeland Security dictatorship.
[02:39:51.932 --> 02:39:59.803]  The Patriot Act I and II, the Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison-surveillance economy, and much more.
[02:40:00.263 --> 02:40:08.515]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism and how the globalists pose as our saviors when in fact they are the terrorists.
[02:40:10.194 --> 02:40:12.275]  Now I've got Police State 1, Police State 2.
[02:40:12.855 --> 02:40:14.476]  They're incredible videos.
[02:40:14.536 --> 02:40:18.437]  Black Helicopters, Foreign Troops, FEMA Cams, Government Provocateurs.
[02:40:18.937 --> 02:40:20.418]  They're all over 2 hours long.
[02:40:20.478 --> 02:40:23.379]  This film is Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:40:23.399 --> 02:40:25.079]  They're $25.95 apiece.
[02:40:25.559 --> 02:40:27.920]  Order 3 or more of any of my 9 videos.
[02:40:27.940 --> 02:40:29.521]  They drop down to $20 apiece.
[02:40:29.901 --> 02:40:30.861]  That's a big discount.
[02:40:31.101 --> 02:40:32.682]  An $18 discount on the 3 tape special.
[02:40:33.242 --> 02:40:35.323]  $24 discount if you get 4 tapes and so on.
[02:40:36.087 --> 02:40:39.048]  My book is $12, 9-1-1 dissent into tyranny.
[02:40:39.168 --> 02:40:39.808]  It's excellent.
[02:40:39.828 --> 02:40:42.189]  It covers what happened on 9-1-1 and what they're doing there.

[02:41:37.097 --> 02:41:44.486]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:41:44.747 --> 02:41:49.512]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:41:49.713 --> 02:41:55.380]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:41:55.680 --> 02:41:56.021]  Thank you.
[02:42:12.223 --> 02:42:14.726]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[02:42:14.966 --> 02:42:21.712]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:42:37.153 --> 02:42:41.656]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:42:42.016 --> 02:42:46.099]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:42:46.399 --> 02:42:46.940]  We listened.
[02:42:47.260 --> 02:42:52.243]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:42:52.503 --> 02:42:53.004]  We listened.
[02:42:53.384 --> 02:42:56.426]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:42:56.846 --> 02:42:57.386]  We listened.
[02:42:57.847 --> 02:43:01.009]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:43:01.209 --> 02:43:01.549]  I don't know.

[02:44:42.297 --> 02:44:48.882]  A big study in Britain shows your child's five times more likely to be brain damaged or have autism if you give them the MMR shot.
[02:44:50.403 --> 02:44:52.204]  And it's not just that shot, it's all of them.
[02:44:53.665 --> 02:44:55.867]  Also Britain to have no say on GM crops.
[02:44:55.907 --> 02:45:05.494]  The Scotsman, Britain could be obliged under European Union law to accept genetically modified produce regardless of public opposition to the controversial crop, see it's total tyranny.
[02:45:06.255 --> 02:45:33.043]  No Liberty, No Sovereignty, Big Brother, iStudents, a national ID number for students, a new computer system to track them has been compared, the failed Australian card bid in the 80s, they're sending that up over there, and contracts to spy on public issue despite outrage, Denver Post, public outrage didn't stop the government from pressing on with plans to create a giant database that spied on Americans of dozens of companies and trying to help according to documents obtained by the National Privacy Advocacy Group,
[02:45:33.709 --> 02:45:37.872]  The Masters of the Universe, this is out of the Asia Times, oninfowars.com.
[02:45:38.452 --> 02:45:40.933]  It may be instructive to learn that U.S.
[02:45:40.953 --> 02:45:42.434]  Defense Secretary, what U.S.
[02:45:42.454 --> 02:45:47.737]  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and the Prince of Darkness, Richard Perle, were doing last weekend from May 15th to the 18th.
[02:45:48.098 --> 02:45:55.602]  They were guests at the Palace Hotel, close to the spectacular Versailles Palace near Paris for the annual meeting of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:45:56.246 --> 02:46:06.291]  Depending on the ideological prism applied, the Bilderberg Club may be considered the ultra-VIP international lobby of the power elite of Europe and America capable of steering international policy from behind closed doors.
[02:46:07.151 --> 02:46:11.553]  And it goes on and on, and you can go read the rest of that at InfoWars.com.
[02:46:12.153 --> 02:46:19.697]  A Stalinist apologist, this is out of the Calgary Sun, New York Times scandal sparks memories of far worse one, Paul Jackson,
[02:46:21.016 --> 02:46:28.177]  A New York Times journalist wins the famed Pulitzer Prize as a reward for covering up the fabricated reports of one of the greatest atrocities in the 20th century.
[02:46:28.197 --> 02:46:47.161]  This particular villain's name was Walter Durante, and what he did fully 70 years ago was conceive and convince most of the world that allegations claiming Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin engineered the masturbation of as many as 12 million Ukrainian presidents and farmers was simply anti-communist propaganda.
[02:46:48.962 --> 02:46:51.545]  Turns out he went there, he knew the truth, he knew what happened.
[02:46:52.186 --> 02:46:58.272]  We now know this appalling crime of genocide, akin to the Nazi persecution of the Jews in Europe and Adolf Hitler's death camps, was true!
[02:46:58.292 --> 02:47:08.904]  Yeah, but the New York Times, there's another story out, wouldn't report this, because it was a lot of Jewish people involved in the extermination, and they've lobbied to keep that out of Holocaust museums.
[02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:22.179]  Yet Durante was hailed at the time as the Dean of Foreign Correspondence and a man whose reports could be trusted absolutely to actually convince President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to give official recognition to the Communist government that seized power in Russia.
[02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:31.807]  Under Stalin, now accepted to be one of the most brutal dictators of all times, Durante reported peace and prosperity were sweeping the Soviet Union and communism was the vanguard of the future.
[02:47:32.167 --> 02:47:34.629]  There was no gulags, no secret trials of dissidents.
[02:47:36.337 --> 02:47:38.838]  The Soviet Union was truly becoming a worker's paradise.
[02:47:39.318 --> 02:47:40.518]  Yet the opposite was true.
[02:47:40.538 --> 02:47:41.479]  And then it goes into it.
[02:47:43.039 --> 02:47:43.820]  Very interesting.
[02:47:43.880 --> 02:47:47.721]  Six French journalists detained on arrival at Los Angeles sent back to France.
[02:47:48.561 --> 02:47:54.123]  Reporters without borders today protested against the detention of six French journalists on arrival.
[02:47:54.863 --> 02:48:05.307]  I had some of these folks on the air a week ago at Los Angeles International Airport to cover a video game trade show and their forcible repatriation after being held at the airport for more than 24 hours.
[02:48:05.367 --> 02:48:05.847]  See folks?
[02:48:06.624 --> 02:48:08.686]  They're rushing to be wearing an anti-war shirt.
[02:48:09.006 --> 02:48:11.548]  They're saying it may be terrorism to be anti-war.
[02:48:13.150 --> 02:48:14.091]  It's across the board.
[02:48:14.131 --> 02:48:15.212]  It's like Nazi Germany.
[02:48:16.993 --> 02:48:18.515]  And it continues.
[02:48:18.835 --> 02:48:18.955]  U.S.
[02:48:19.035 --> 02:48:23.239]  uses GM foods in first assault on EU trade battle.
[02:48:24.900 --> 02:48:32.968]  There's an article here by David Hackworth, Colonel Hackworth, admitting our government's using secrecy clauses to cover up the trillion dollars missing at the Pentagon.
[02:48:34.333 --> 02:48:35.435]  All visitors to the U.S.
[02:48:35.475 --> 02:48:38.078]  on visas to be fingerprinted, but so are Americans leaving.
[02:48:38.098 --> 02:48:49.010]  And we posted an article on InfoWars.com about the Maraginian bloodline, which they talk about in Matrix 2, which I don't suggest.
[02:48:49.150 --> 02:48:50.471]  It's mind control, folks.
[02:48:50.531 --> 02:48:50.952]  I've seen it.
[02:48:51.847 --> 02:48:53.128]  And, uh, it goes on and on.
[02:48:53.328 --> 02:48:54.129]  I am out of time.
[02:48:54.169 --> 02:48:57.432]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time!
[02:48:57.872 --> 02:49:00.114]  On the shortwave at 5.085 and 6890.
[02:49:00.474 --> 02:49:04.097]  And during the day, from 11 to 2 Central on 12.172 and 9320.
[02:49:04.298 --> 02:49:07.781]  And at InfoWars.com or Net.
[02:49:07.941 --> 02:49:09.702]  And on your local AM or FM dial.
[02:49:10.923 --> 02:49:12.344]  I'm out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:12.384 --> 02:49:13.285]  God bless you all.
[02:49:13.305 --> 02:49:16.188]  Hitachi's announced even smaller microchips.
[02:49:16.208 --> 02:49:18.770]  We've got them on the website to go in the money, the clothes, everything.
[02:49:18.790 --> 02:49:19.871]  More on that.
[02:49:20.698 --> 02:49:21.339]  I'm out of time.
[02:49:21.379 --> 02:49:23.021]  Just get out there and stand up to the globalists.
[02:49:23.041 --> 02:49:24.462]  Get out there and fight these criminals.
[02:49:24.783 --> 02:49:25.864]  Resist them, you must.
[02:49:26.565 --> 02:49:28.367]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:49:28.527 --> 02:49:29.128]  I mean, real.
[02:49:29.328 --> 02:49:34.173]  Hard to find all-natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[02:49:34.494 --> 02:49:35.354]  Probably never, right?
[02:49:35.635 --> 02:49:37.457]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I want to...
