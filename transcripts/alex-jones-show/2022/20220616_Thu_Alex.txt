[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.440]  [Music]
[00:00:16.506 --> 00:00:17.406]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:17.507 --> 00:00:30.507]   today. The evidence of vaccine death and injuries is overwhelming to anyone capable of seeing
[00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:35.185]  past the mainstream media's hypnotic lies.
[00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:40.660]  The numbers tell us that the vaccines have already caused a 20% increase in deaths.
[00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:43.983]  Now we have a run rate of about 20% excess mortality.
[00:00:44.283 --> 00:00:49.507]  That's confirmed by the CDC numbers, the funeral home numbers and the insurance company numbers.
[00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:53.830]  And then somebody did an independent study I saw recently suggesting 20% is the number.
[00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:55.912]   So we're running And a 20% excess deaths.
[00:00:56.153 --> 00:00:58.575]  And a 10% increase in disabilities.
[00:00:58.936 --> 00:00:59.997]  This is a stunning number.
[00:01:00.597 --> 00:01:06.384]  You're telling me that things have been flat for 5 years at 29 million and all of a sudden out of the data they got 3 million people are disabled?
[00:01:06.404 --> 00:01:07.525]  Out of nowhere?
[00:01:08.206 --> 00:01:12.010]  And now we are beginning to understand that this is just the beginning.
[00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.692]  Things are going to get much, much worse.
[00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:25.921]  Many of us have already seen the mysterious objects found in the vials of COVID vaccines by two separate independent groups using electron microscopy.
[00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:37.850]  We are also familiar with the rising number of strokes, heart attacks, and other side effects experienced worldwide after the biggest experimental vaccination in history.
[00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.733]  And now we are getting a first glimpse of what is causing all this.
[00:01:43.493 --> 00:01:48.897]  Something in the COVID vaccines seems to be growing within the recipient's vascular system.
[00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:55.901]  Anomalous objects are being discovered in the dead bodies of the vaccinated by embalmers and coroners.
[00:01:56.641 --> 00:02:00.924]  Horrific things being grown inside the veins and arteries.
[00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:06.628]  These are not blood clots and they appear to be some sort of organic material.
[00:02:07.435 --> 00:02:14.061]  With small crystals and extremely thin wires made up of what looks like reptilian scales.
[00:02:15.923 --> 00:02:24.071]  This internal blockage growing within the vaccinated would certainly explain all of the deadly side effects we are seeing today.
[00:02:24.952 --> 00:02:30.397]  What the mainstream media is currently spinning as sudden adult death syndrome.
[00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.034]  We do not know what these things are, but they are being found by embalmers and coroners everywhere.
[00:02:38.754 --> 00:02:42.736]  Except, pretty much all of them are too afraid to speak out.
[00:02:43.477 --> 00:02:44.357]  Or they don't care.
[00:02:45.278 --> 00:02:48.940]  Only one has shown the courage to speak out so far.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.121]  And this is the real tragedy.
[00:02:52.142 --> 00:02:55.123]  For those who remain silent, things will not get better.
[00:02:55.903 --> 00:03:02.805]  The FDA is poised to authorize these deadly vaccines to children as young as six months old.
[00:03:03.486 --> 00:03:05.306]  And humanity does nothing.
[00:03:05.826 --> 00:03:11.008]  Today, we want to provide an update on a topic that I know many parents and grandparents are focused on.
[00:03:11.628 --> 00:03:16.210]  The potential for the first COVID-19 vaccines for kids under five.
[00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.851]  We have waited a long time for this moment.
[00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:21.732]  Well, guys, here's some good news.
[00:03:21.772 --> 00:03:28.655]  The Biden administration has finally announced a vaccine rollout plan for children under five, and they've ordered 10 million doses.
[00:03:29.716 --> 00:03:30.116]  That's great.
[00:03:31.636 --> 00:03:40.921]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I know that if you watch InfoWars live every day, you've probably seen that report four or five times now.
[00:03:41.841 --> 00:03:50.900]   But it's extremely imperative, and I've got all this other news to cover and it's important to remember what's been done to us with these vaccines.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.821]  We can never forget it.
[00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:56.065]  We can never forget the lies of our government.
[00:03:56.105 --> 00:03:58.267]  We can never forget the lies of Anthony Fauci.
[00:03:59.328 --> 00:04:01.210]  The lies of the vaccine manufacturers.
[00:04:02.932 --> 00:04:05.535]  And just how evil what they've done is.
[00:04:09.011 --> 00:04:19.314]  And now, not only do we have all the people getting the clots, and dying, and having the facial paralysis, and the Guillain-Barre, they're having their immune systems reset.
[00:04:22.616 --> 00:04:28.017]  They don't even stop COVID, and four times injected Fauci now, supposedly has COVID-19.
[00:04:29.098 --> 00:04:31.819]  We are live on this Thursday, June 16th.
[00:04:34.192 --> 00:04:44.335]  2022, the Alex Jones Show, InfoWars, lives on, despite the largest criminal group in world history trying to destroy us.
[00:04:45.935 --> 00:04:53.017]  What an epic thing to be a part of, and we're all in this together, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:53.097 --> 00:04:53.398]  All right.
[00:04:55.058 --> 00:04:58.539]  I have an absolutely loaded news desk today.
[00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:01.420]  Let me tell you everything we've got.
[00:05:02.478 --> 00:05:04.478]  It's going to be a heavy news broadcast.
[00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.140]  We've got the left, the Democrats, the liberals.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.361]  At this point, is it fair to say they've gone full pedophilia?
[00:05:16.361 --> 00:05:19.962]  Or I guess as they would prefer you call it, minor attracted persons.
[00:05:21.602 --> 00:05:26.483]  Because you now have Attorney General saying, we need more drag queens.
[00:05:26.543 --> 00:05:29.564]  We need a drag queen in every school, every day.
[00:05:30.524 --> 00:05:30.804]  Wow.
[00:05:31.932 --> 00:05:32.312]  Why?
[00:05:34.114 --> 00:05:34.394]  Why?
[00:05:34.874 --> 00:05:35.615]  What about a stripper?
[00:05:36.495 --> 00:05:53.708]  Yeah, as there's multiple investigations underway because these drag queens, who are just men, pretending to be female strippers, that's what it is, it's men pretending to be female strippers for children, and their genitals are on display!
[00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:55.389]  Their genitals.
[00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.971]  That's a crime.
[00:05:59.394 --> 00:05:59.894]  That's a crime.
[00:06:00.554 --> 00:06:02.735]  Plus against minors, you're on sexual watch list.
[00:06:02.775 --> 00:06:03.495]  You're now a predator.
[00:06:04.296 --> 00:06:05.616]  Oh, but it's liberal!
[00:06:06.196 --> 00:06:07.417]  Oh, it's Pride Month!
[00:06:08.277 --> 00:06:09.657]  Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot.
[00:06:10.037 --> 00:06:16.059]  Sexual crimes against children are now okay as long as you're a liberal or it's Pride Month, then it's all good.
[00:06:16.079 --> 00:06:17.400]  You just say, liberal, liberal, liberal!
[00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:19.120]  And then you show the kids your genitals.
[00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:21.081]  Pride Month, Pride Month, Pride Month!
[00:06:21.101 --> 00:06:22.021]  Here's my genitals, kids!
[00:06:25.062 --> 00:06:25.983]  So that's what's going on now.
[00:06:26.023 --> 00:06:26.523]  So is it fair?
[00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:44.595]  Well, we'll find out, because Republicans are putting Democrats in a position now where they either have to come out and say, yep, we affirm minor attracted persons, or they're going to have to back off all the sexual deviancy they've been promoting and engaging in.
[00:06:45.535 --> 00:06:48.676]  I then have a stack of economic news, and it's not good.
[00:06:50.236 --> 00:06:50.816]  How could it be?
[00:06:51.317 --> 00:06:53.277]  Biden is in the White House.
[00:06:53.418 --> 00:06:55.018]  Democrats are in control.
[00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:58.740]  And their plan was always to wreck this country.
[00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:06.744]  Biden campaigned in front of tens of people, saying how he was going to shut down the energy sector.
[00:07:06.964 --> 00:07:09.085]  And he's done things to shut down the energy sector.
[00:07:09.405 --> 00:07:21.655]   Just last month, just last month, honestly, The ability for Joe Biden to lie, I mean, it's tough to even say if he knows what's going on.
[00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:28.937]  Last month, Joe Biden cancelled two oil pipeline leases.
[00:07:30.718 --> 00:07:31.638]  I forget the exact story.
[00:07:31.658 --> 00:07:32.538]  He cancelled two of them.
[00:07:32.578 --> 00:07:33.338]  They had permits.
[00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:34.599]  He cancelled them.
[00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:37.380]  So less oil being produced.
[00:07:38.379 --> 00:07:49.407]  And then the next day, he goes out and makes a speech saying he's doing everything he can to lower the prices the day after he cancelled a pipeline lease.
[00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:59.754]  So imagine, he goes, Joe Biden goes into like the electrical room and turns off all the switches.
[00:08:00.755 --> 00:08:02.637]  So, no, actually, no, no, no, let's be more accurate.
[00:08:03.057 --> 00:08:07.200]  Joe Biden runs around town saying, I'm going to turn off the electricity.
[00:08:08.356 --> 00:08:11.720]  And he goes around telling everybody how he's gonna turn off the electricity and how good it is.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.141]  Okay.
[00:08:12.962 --> 00:08:17.087]  Then he goes to the electrical room and actually turns all the switches off.
[00:08:17.187 --> 00:08:22.073]  Just... And he's just down there just turning every switch off.
[00:08:23.274 --> 00:08:27.840]  And then the next day he goes on TV and he says, I'm gonna do everything I can to put those switches on.
[00:08:29.915 --> 00:08:32.196]  And you say, I just watched you turn them all off.
[00:08:32.236 --> 00:08:33.397]  You told me you were going to turn them all off.
[00:08:33.437 --> 00:08:33.817]  You did it.
[00:08:33.837 --> 00:08:36.559]  What do you mean now you're telling me you're going to turn them all on and that makes you a hero?
[00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:36.979]  What?
[00:08:37.879 --> 00:08:41.521]  That's the level of lying.
[00:08:41.561 --> 00:08:43.082]  That's the level of deceit.
[00:08:43.302 --> 00:08:44.323]  What a scumbag.
[00:08:44.643 --> 00:08:51.247]  And then what absolute morons or scumbags would ever support this liar, this criminal?
[00:08:53.068 --> 00:08:55.329]  But okay, we've got that economic news coming up.
[00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:06.084]  Liberals falling for fake news again, desperately, hopelessly trying to destroy the Republicans that are actually pushing back against them.
[00:09:06.404 --> 00:09:12.167]  Not the cucks like Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, but I mean real American patriots like Lauren Boebert and Paul Gosar and others.
[00:09:12.748 --> 00:09:14.288]  Oh, they fall for fake news every time.
[00:09:15.629 --> 00:09:19.651]  And there's kind of a little sub-story there that others aren't really seeing.
[00:09:19.711 --> 00:09:22.152]  It's not, well, we'll cover that.
[00:09:22.453 --> 00:09:23.053]  It's nothing new.
[00:09:23.093 --> 00:09:24.694]  Liberals falling for fake news, it's what they do.
[00:09:26.414 --> 00:09:27.894]  Oh, and also domestic terrorism.
[00:09:27.914 --> 00:09:28.914]  That's another thing they do.
[00:09:29.855 --> 00:09:30.755]  Domestic terrorism.
[00:09:31.455 --> 00:09:36.476]  And the group Jane's Revenge and the group Shut Down D.C.
[00:09:37.016 --> 00:09:38.556]  are both marching around D.C.
[00:09:38.636 --> 00:09:39.176]  every day.
[00:09:39.776 --> 00:09:41.217]  They have lawyers on call.
[00:09:41.237 --> 00:09:42.817]  They have bail bondsmen on call.
[00:09:43.817 --> 00:09:52.198]  They're anticipating the Roe vs. Wade decision to come down, in which case they're going to start burning churches, burning pregnancy centers, burning buildings in D.C.
[00:09:52.699 --> 00:10:08.966]   And they've written manifestos On how they're gonna do this, they've published the addresses of pregnancy centers, they've published the addresses of the Supreme Court justices, they've published the addresses of the Supreme Court justices' children!
[00:10:09.827 --> 00:10:12.048]  All of this, publicly done!
[00:10:12.749 --> 00:10:19.974]  Not a word from the FBI, not a word from Department of Homeland Security, not a word from the Biden administration.
[00:10:20.254 --> 00:10:24.377]  In fact, I take that back, there has been a word from the Biden administration.
[00:10:24.697 --> 00:10:26.118]  They're encouraging it!
[00:10:27.076 --> 00:10:28.177]  They're encouraging it.
[00:10:29.958 --> 00:10:39.464]  So how dare the largest domestic terror group in the history of this country, the Democrat Party, wave fingers and point fingers at Donald Trump and his voters?
[00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:44.088]  I don't want to hear a damn thing from the party of murdering babies.
[00:10:44.448 --> 00:10:47.990]  I don't want to hear a damn thing from the party of domestic terrorism.
[00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:51.773]  I don't want to hear a damn thing from the party of shut off our oil.
[00:10:56.021 --> 00:10:58.762]  Then we've got developments, geopolitical developments.
[00:10:59.842 --> 00:11:08.264]  The situation in Ukraine is getting worse for Biden and Zelensky, except for the fact they're stealing billions of dollars.
[00:11:08.544 --> 00:11:09.544]  So that's good for them.
[00:11:09.584 --> 00:11:11.044]  They're stealing billions of dollars.
[00:11:11.544 --> 00:11:13.225]  But they're losing Ukraine.
[00:11:13.785 --> 00:11:16.465]  They're losing the hearts and minds of people around the world.
[00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:18.586]  They're losing the support of Europe.
[00:11:18.826 --> 00:11:20.646]  They're losing really of everyone.
[00:11:20.666 --> 00:11:22.626]  I mean, you know, I'm sorry.
[00:11:22.646 --> 00:11:36.405]   I really am sorry that Our media and our politicians are such lying scumbags that won't tell you the truth about what's going on in Ukraine.
[00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:37.245]  I'm sorry.
[00:11:38.025 --> 00:11:46.768]  And I'm sorry that you have to tune in to Infowars and I don't know if anywhere else is really even telling you the truth about what's going on in Ukraine as far as the size of our audience here.
[00:11:46.788 --> 00:11:51.609]  I mean, there's a lot of other independent journalists like one in Germany who's been, I believe, arrested now.
[00:11:54.437 --> 00:11:54.897]  Oh, no, no, no.
[00:11:54.997 --> 00:11:55.297]  That's right.
[00:11:55.317 --> 00:11:56.418]  She's had her bank account frozen.
[00:11:56.438 --> 00:11:57.418]  They'll probably arrest her next.
[00:11:58.198 --> 00:12:02.459]  Folks, Russia is doing whatever it wants in Ukraine.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:09.101]  It's had, like, a tiny amount of resistance, I guess you could call it.
[00:12:09.841 --> 00:12:10.342]  Resistance.
[00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:15.483]  They've had a small amount of resistance, to which they could have just wiped out entirely, but they were patient about it.
[00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:18.364]  And Russia's doing pretty much whatever it wants in Ukraine.
[00:12:19.404 --> 00:12:22.405]  And European countries are saying, we don't want to fight Biden's war.
[00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:31.122]  And the rest of the power structures of the planet, geopolitically, is siding with Russia now.
[00:12:32.122 --> 00:12:42.186]  So you've got the NATO and EU allies of the US all basically saying, we don't want anything to do with Biden's war in Ukraine, we want nothing to do with this.
[00:12:43.466 --> 00:12:49.068]  Then you have all the other countries that are at the top of the power structure in the world, they're all siding with Russia.
[00:12:49.708 --> 00:12:55.885]   So, I'm sorry your media and your politicians aren't telling you this, I don't even know how to properly explain it.
[00:12:55.905 --> 00:12:58.026]  I mean, isolationism maybe?
[00:12:58.546 --> 00:13:00.687]  You know, they all said Trump would isolate us from the planet.
[00:13:00.727 --> 00:13:01.667]  Folks, that's Biden.
[00:13:01.927 --> 00:13:04.668]  You know the Saudi Arabians don't even want to talk to Joe Biden?
[00:13:05.608 --> 00:13:06.909]  They don't even want to talk to him.
[00:13:08.649 --> 00:13:10.310]  They ignore his phone calls.
[00:13:13.851 --> 00:13:16.512]  Whenever the White House reaches out to European countries, they roll their eyes.
[00:13:16.652 --> 00:13:17.452]  They don't want to deal with this.
[00:13:17.572 --> 00:13:19.653]  They don't want to deal with this garbage administration.
[00:13:21.192 --> 00:13:23.893]  So I'm sorry that you've been lied to about everything in Ukraine.
[00:13:24.814 --> 00:13:28.616]  It's been a disaster for the US, actually, more than anybody.
[00:13:29.436 --> 00:13:30.677]  Aside from Ukraine, perhaps.
[00:13:31.257 --> 00:13:31.918]  So we've got that.
[00:13:32.278 --> 00:13:36.080]  I've got a whole stack of COVID and vaccine news here that's got important developments.
[00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:39.602]  We've got some election news.
[00:13:39.662 --> 00:13:42.663]  Democrats continue to try to come after your firearms.
[00:13:43.764 --> 00:13:55.728]   It's all coming up, plus a lot of video clips on this Thursday, June 16th, 2022, live edition of the Alex Jones Show, 145 days away from the historic midterms.
[00:13:56.389 --> 00:14:06.054]  President Clinton appointed what one commentator called this week a bunch of high IQ stupid people.
[00:14:06.074 --> 00:14:09.376]  In other words, they were well educated but no common sense.
[00:14:09.976 --> 00:14:13.678]   President Biden has appointed Whack jobs?
[00:14:13.958 --> 00:14:18.260]  I mean, it's like these people dropped acid in an outback parking lot.
[00:14:19.121 --> 00:14:20.721]  You can't reason with them.
[00:14:21.562 --> 00:14:29.045]  They are just so awoke, so woke, and that's the difference, in my opinion, and why they haven't, of course, corrected.
[00:14:30.385 --> 00:14:35.788]  Senator John Kennedy telling it like it is on Fox News last night.
[00:14:35.828 --> 00:14:38.309]  Yeah, I mean, they are whack jobs.
[00:14:40.347 --> 00:14:45.610]  And it's like a weird woketopia whack job fest happening in the White House.
[00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:47.311]  Hey, look, oh, this person's gay.
[00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:48.371]  Hey, this person's black.
[00:14:48.391 --> 00:14:50.032]  Hey, this person's a puppy kink.
[00:14:50.532 --> 00:14:53.334]  Hey, this person's a man that thinks he's a woman.
[00:14:53.414 --> 00:14:54.114]  Oh, all right.
[00:14:55.575 --> 00:14:57.136]  It's a clown show.
[00:14:57.296 --> 00:14:58.136]  It's a circus.
[00:14:59.557 --> 00:15:00.918]  The kids are running the school.
[00:15:00.978 --> 00:15:02.418]  The kids are driving the bus.
[00:15:03.179 --> 00:15:04.740]  The insane people are running the asylum.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.781]  I mean, pick your analogy.
[00:15:07.348 --> 00:15:12.388]   That's what's going on. So of course America is falling apart at the seams.
[00:15:12.388 --> 00:15:15.348]  Of course the economy is an absolute disaster right now.
[00:15:15.348 --> 00:15:22.468]   By the way, I said largest Fed rate hike since '74 yesterday. It's '94.
[00:15:22.468 --> 00:15:27.508]   Here's the Fed statement on the biggest interest rate hike since 1994.
[00:15:27.508 --> 00:15:33.428]   So, uh, yeah. The statement is Biden is crushing your economy.
[00:15:33.541 --> 00:15:34.362]  What do you want us to do?
[00:15:35.062 --> 00:15:41.526]  Food stamps, credit card debt, record high inflation forces some older Americans to make tough financial choices.
[00:15:42.627 --> 00:15:48.871]  Yeah, that access, that ease of access, that abundance, that excess, it's all gone now, and it's all by design.
[00:15:49.952 --> 00:15:51.493]  It's all by design.
[00:15:53.634 --> 00:15:59.498]  America must be brought to heel, and Biden is doing just that, and the whole world is watching in amazement.
[00:16:00.572 --> 00:16:01.473]  In amazement.
[00:16:03.914 --> 00:16:08.376]  And they don't know what to do, because this is going to cost them in the midterms.
[00:16:08.396 --> 00:16:18.001]  The only chance the Democrats really have is just a bigger theft than 2020, which will be so obvious that I don't know how they'll pull that off.
[00:16:19.082 --> 00:16:26.125]  But these are desperate criminals we're talking about here, so I wouldn't put it past them.
[00:16:28.406 --> 00:16:29.427]  I wouldn't put it past them.
[00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:34.341]  As Biden screams into microphones, yelling at Vladimir Putin.
[00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:36.641]  It's like, Putin has raised our gas!
[00:16:36.702 --> 00:16:37.722]  Putin has done this!
[00:16:37.802 --> 00:16:39.242]  Putin has crashed our economy!
[00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:40.022]  Oh, really?
[00:16:41.243 --> 00:16:43.083]  I woke up this morning, had a bit of a stomachache.
[00:16:43.123 --> 00:16:43.863]  Dang it, Putin!
[00:16:44.583 --> 00:16:45.544]  That darn Russian.
[00:16:46.264 --> 00:16:46.904]  Man, oh man.
[00:16:50.205 --> 00:16:51.065]  Yard was a mess.
[00:16:51.225 --> 00:16:53.446]  Windstorm came through, blew all these trees down.
[00:16:53.466 --> 00:16:54.726]  Man, frickin' Putin, man.
[00:16:56.345 --> 00:16:57.066]  No, it's Biden.
[00:16:57.126 --> 00:16:58.167]  It's the Democrats.
[00:16:58.447 --> 00:17:01.009]  They campaigned on this.
[00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:04.492]  They call it a transition, and then they deny it.
[00:17:05.033 --> 00:17:07.235]  They say, this is gonna be a tough transition period.
[00:17:07.455 --> 00:17:08.736]  We're shutting off your energy.
[00:17:09.236 --> 00:17:11.078]  We're transitioning into the new world.
[00:17:11.578 --> 00:17:12.940]  Okay, what's the transition?
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.302]  Well, you're gonna have your country collapse.
[00:17:15.642 --> 00:17:16.943]  Yeah, I don't like this transition much.
[00:17:17.163 --> 00:17:17.884]  What transition?
[00:17:17.944 --> 00:17:18.725]  It's Putin's fault!
[00:17:20.899 --> 00:17:30.583]  Despite ongoing energy crisis and record fuel prices every day, leftist activists sue Biden administration to block 3,500 oil and gas permits.
[00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:34.184]  They love shutting down our energy.
[00:17:34.744 --> 00:17:53.830]   But hey, I mean, lazy bum liberals Lazy bums who don't have a job, don't have a family, and don't really care if they can have cheap gas or not, because they're, you know, flying around with bongo drums, hanging out in trees playing the bongos.
[00:17:54.811 --> 00:18:11.781]   Yeah, they don't care about gas prices going up, but you, the guy and the girl that works and has a family and needs to take your kids to school and maybe drives 30 miles to work, yeah, you care, but not the bum liberal That is begging to increase energy prices by shutting off all of our gas permits.
[00:18:13.503 --> 00:18:17.345]  And again, I just... Guys, this is kind of bothering me.
[00:18:17.365 --> 00:18:18.265]  See if you can find it.
[00:18:18.446 --> 00:18:21.187]  It was May 12th, Associated Press headline.
[00:18:22.728 --> 00:18:24.790]  Something about Biden canceling oil leases.
[00:18:24.970 --> 00:18:25.710]  See if you can find this.
[00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.571]  It's just sitting in my head.
[00:18:26.611 --> 00:18:27.231]  I can't remember it.
[00:18:28.052 --> 00:18:33.155]  But... Biden cancels oil deals.
[00:18:34.201 --> 00:18:41.085]  Okay, that would bring more oil into the country, lower oil prices, give us some more access.
[00:18:41.705 --> 00:18:42.626]  Thank you guys so much.
[00:18:43.866 --> 00:18:44.947]  Crew has my back.
[00:18:45.307 --> 00:18:49.389]  Biden cancels offshore oil lease sales in Gulf Coast and Alaska.
[00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.910]  So that was May 12, 2022.
[00:18:51.971 --> 00:18:56.833]  Last month, Biden cancels offshore oil lease sales in Gulf Coast, Alaska.
[00:18:57.034 --> 00:19:00.055]  So he's canceled hundreds of these deals.
[00:19:00.656 --> 00:19:02.797]  These liberal activists want him to cancel the rest.
[00:19:03.905 --> 00:19:07.248]  So you'll literally have no gas coming in, $10 a gallon.
[00:19:07.528 --> 00:19:08.088]  Screw that!
[00:19:08.328 --> 00:19:10.870]  You're talking $30, $40, $50 a gallon!
[00:19:13.232 --> 00:19:14.133]  If they do this.
[00:19:15.514 --> 00:19:25.921]  So Biden shuts off all the oil deals, shuts off all the pipelines, and then the next day goes on TV and says, I'm doing everything I can to lower your gas prices.
[00:19:26.362 --> 00:19:29.604]  A complete lie to your face!
[00:19:29.644 --> 00:19:31.185]  He might as well spit in your face.
[00:19:31.205 --> 00:19:33.187]  He might as well piss in your face and call it rain.
[00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:42.825]  And then, to buy Europe's silence in this disaster, he gives Europe our strategic oil reserves.
[00:19:43.926 --> 00:19:45.667]  That's what's going on here, folks.
[00:19:47.389 --> 00:19:52.653]  They say, hey, we're gonna release the strategic oil reserves to lower your gas prices.
[00:19:53.053 --> 00:19:54.934]  It never happened.
[00:19:54.954 --> 00:20:01.239]  They have released more than half our strategic oil reserves, and half of that, if not more, have gone to Europe!
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:11.405]   You say, well, why would he be Sending our oil reserves to Europe because Biden's war in Ukraine has been a disaster for Europe, too!
[00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:14.447]  Putin hasn't doubled the gas prices in Europe.
[00:20:14.667 --> 00:20:15.407]  Biden has!
[00:20:16.628 --> 00:20:19.810]  So what does Biden do to buy the silence from European leaders?
[00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:20.930]  To buy their loyalty?
[00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.271]  Hey, you guys, don't blame me for this.
[00:20:23.331 --> 00:20:23.952]  Blame Putin.
[00:20:24.232 --> 00:20:25.252]  Well, what are you going to do for us?
[00:20:25.513 --> 00:20:27.194]  I'll give you our strategic oil reserves.
[00:20:28.474 --> 00:20:29.615]  And that's what Biden has done.
[00:20:31.482 --> 00:20:39.148]  And then he goes on TV and tells you he's doing everything possible to lower your gas prices when the exact opposite is the reality.
[00:20:40.009 --> 00:20:44.292]  Fuel thefts on the rise as Biden gas prices continue to hit all-time record highs.
[00:20:44.312 --> 00:20:46.293]  Yeah, people siphoning fuel out of cars.
[00:20:46.353 --> 00:20:46.954]  It's a new thing.
[00:20:47.414 --> 00:20:51.617]  Or drilling holes into the bottom of your gas tank so they can leak it out into their gas can.
[00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:56.001]  Only in Biden's America, a third world hellhole run by Democrats.
[00:20:56.421 --> 00:21:01.125]  Abbott's baby formula plant in Sturgis, Michigan closed again, this time due to weather damage.
[00:21:01.305 --> 00:21:06.009]  So a legitimate closing this time, too bad they illegitimately shut it down and now there's a baby formula shortage.
[00:21:06.369 --> 00:21:07.911]  It's Democrats, that's what they do.
[00:21:08.511 --> 00:21:14.655]  Biden Energy Secretary tells Americans to stop complaining because Brazilians have to pay the same amount for gas.
[00:21:15.075 --> 00:21:15.816]  Oh, I see.
[00:21:16.296 --> 00:21:19.038]  Well, hey, liberals, stop complaining about gun violence.
[00:21:19.098 --> 00:21:20.599]  It's worse in Mexico and Brazil.
[00:21:20.999 --> 00:21:22.040]  Stop complaining, liberals.
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.941]  So much worse in other countries.
[00:21:24.141 --> 00:21:25.022]  Stop complaining, libs.
[00:21:25.282 --> 00:21:26.943]  Stop complaining, dems, about gun crimes.
[00:21:27.223 --> 00:21:27.944]  It's worse in Brazil.
[00:21:29.062 --> 00:21:32.224]  White House demands oil companies be patriots, produce more gas.
[00:21:32.264 --> 00:21:34.526]  Can you imagine how ticked off these oil companies are?
[00:21:34.786 --> 00:21:42.331]  By the way, who knows what's really going on, but in 2020 and 2021, the oil companies claim to have lost money.
[00:21:44.193 --> 00:21:47.015]  In 2020 and 2021, oil companies claim to have lost money.
[00:21:47.255 --> 00:21:58.243]  And then, because the pandemic and then Biden canceled all these deals that they had basically planned out financially, economically for the oil companies for decades, and Biden canceled all of it, they ended up taking a loss.
[00:21:59.588 --> 00:22:00.449]  Biden threatens U.S.
[00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:02.751]  oil companies with the use of emergency authorities.
[00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:09.076]  Can you imagine being an oil company and Biden is doing everything to crush your business, and then he turns around and points the finger at you?
[00:22:09.096 --> 00:22:10.877]  Yeah.
[00:22:11.337 --> 00:22:13.219]  Everybody knows Joe Biden's a scumbag.
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:15.461]  Only liars pretend he's not.
[00:22:15.801 --> 00:22:21.165]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not really surprised that no Democrats will endorse Joe Biden in 2024.
[00:22:21.646 --> 00:22:24.148]  Who would want to saddle up next to this disaster?
[00:22:25.472 --> 00:22:27.693]  People are leaving his administration left and right.
[00:22:27.733 --> 00:22:30.754]  Kamala Harris can't keep anybody in her office either.
[00:22:31.575 --> 00:22:32.975]  It's an absolute embarrassment.
[00:22:33.035 --> 00:22:34.296]  It's an absolute disaster.
[00:22:34.856 --> 00:22:41.619]  And as much as the media tries to cover it up because they know they helped cause the disaster of Biden, it's not working.
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.041]  It's not working.
[00:22:45.481 --> 00:22:58.574]   So even Democrats that will Pair at the same talking points, narratives, policies as Joe Biden, they won't belly up to say that they'll endorse him for 2024 because Biden is that unpopular.
[00:22:58.634 --> 00:23:00.694]  And this is a Democrat party that's very loyal.
[00:23:02.175 --> 00:23:05.056]  Very mono-thinking, if you will.
[00:23:08.017 --> 00:23:10.458]  And they won't get behind Biden for 2024.
[00:23:10.558 --> 00:23:13.559]  That just tells you how bad this thing really is.
[00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:19.632]  That just tells you how much of a disaster Joe Biden really is.
[00:23:19.652 --> 00:23:25.695]  It's getting tougher and tougher for the lying media to cover it up every day.
[00:23:29.157 --> 00:23:29.778]  Boy, oh boy.
[00:23:29.818 --> 00:23:32.579]  But we've got a response here from the oil companies.

[00:26:09.818 --> 00:26:12.400]  Is what keeps us on the air.
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:20.525]  All right, so no Democrats want to endorse failing Joe.
[00:26:20.726 --> 00:26:22.207]  Failing, flailing Joe.
[00:26:23.607 --> 00:26:27.690]  A news outlet asked every Democrat senator if they'll endorse Biden in 2024.
[00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.411]  Not many said yes.
[00:26:30.012 --> 00:26:31.473]  Not many at all.
[00:26:31.793 --> 00:26:32.854]  Only five actually.
[00:26:35.171 --> 00:26:44.616]  And I bet they probably would change their answer if they knew it wouldn't be harmonious with the rest of the leftist stooges in the Democrat Party.
[00:26:45.817 --> 00:26:48.238]  Another top staffer leaves Biden administration.
[00:26:48.698 --> 00:26:50.679]  White House counsel departing next month.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:57.803]  And by the way, folks, look, here's what's been going on in the Kamala Harris and Joe Biden offices.
[00:26:58.063 --> 00:27:05.709]   With Kamala, A bunch of people got in there because, hey, it's a job in D.C., it's a job in the White House, Vice President.
[00:27:05.969 --> 00:27:10.453]  You know, you think, hey, first female, first black female, pretty exciting stuff.
[00:27:10.913 --> 00:27:15.496]  So a lot of these people got in there and it was just so miserable that they quit.
[00:27:17.138 --> 00:27:21.601]  The dealing with Kamala Harris was too much for these people.
[00:27:22.121 --> 00:27:24.423]  She's a very unpleasant person.
[00:27:24.703 --> 00:27:26.765]  Not many people like Kamala Harris.
[00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:30.352]  Um, they may like her for one thing and one thing only.
[00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:38.760]  But... So she's been hemorrhaging staffers on her office, in her office.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:43.384]  Can't replace them, so... Nobody really knows what's going on with Kamala.
[00:27:43.404 --> 00:27:45.245]  She's kind of in the magical disappearing act.
[00:27:46.186 --> 00:27:48.048]  The liberals feigned excitement for her.
[00:27:48.568 --> 00:27:49.489]  Oh, first female!
[00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:50.490]  Oh, first black female!
[00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:51.010]  All this crap.
[00:27:51.331 --> 00:27:52.852]  Yeah, they've thrown her to the trash heap.
[00:27:53.826 --> 00:27:56.929]  She's become a non-factor, a non-story, a nothing.
[00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.411]  But that's the Harris office.
[00:27:58.431 --> 00:27:59.632]  Then there's the Biden office.
[00:28:01.174 --> 00:28:02.916]  Now, with Biden it was a little bit different.
[00:28:03.056 --> 00:28:06.920]  The Democrats brought in a bunch of... They love their tokens.
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.062]  White liberals love their tokens.
[00:28:09.182 --> 00:28:10.163]  Their tokens of color.
[00:28:11.144 --> 00:28:12.626]  Kamala Harris being one of them.
[00:28:13.106 --> 00:28:15.008]  The new press secretary being another one of them.
[00:28:16.464 --> 00:28:18.746]  White liberals really love their tokens of color.
[00:28:18.786 --> 00:28:19.987]  They're sick racist people.
[00:28:20.567 --> 00:28:22.028]  Biden is one of them.
[00:28:22.529 --> 00:28:26.152]  And so they had a bunch of token hires in Biden's office.
[00:28:26.957 --> 00:28:28.378]  They wanted a bunch of token hires.
[00:28:28.418 --> 00:28:30.579]  Hey, let's have quote-unquote diversity.
[00:28:31.159 --> 00:28:34.441]  Yeah, that's their cover for racism.
[00:28:35.341 --> 00:28:37.462]  Diversity is their cover for racism.
[00:28:37.522 --> 00:28:42.705]  Really, they're just bigots who hire people as tokens.
[00:28:42.825 --> 00:28:45.146]  In fact, you can plug into a search engine, guys, if you can.
[00:28:47.358 --> 00:28:56.107]  Almost all the black staffers in Biden's office quit because they realized real quickly they were only hired as token hires.
[00:28:56.667 --> 00:28:59.270]  And they didn't really like that treatment and so they quit.
[00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:00.691]  So it's a disaster.
[00:29:00.811 --> 00:29:02.593]  Nobody wants to work for these bums.
[00:29:03.134 --> 00:29:08.119]  Nobody wants to work for these crooks, these liars, the Bidens or Kamala Harris.
[00:29:09.429 --> 00:29:15.213]  And of course, you know, the media's there to prop them up as something they're not.
[00:29:15.993 --> 00:29:17.414]  Here's an example from the Atlantic.
[00:29:17.494 --> 00:29:20.196]  Tom Nichols, boy this guy must be a real piece of work.
[00:29:21.056 --> 00:29:24.679]  Tom Nichols from a headline from September 2019 on Trump.
[00:29:25.259 --> 00:29:27.941]  If this isn't impeachable, nothing is.
[00:29:29.221 --> 00:29:30.102]  Nothing is.
[00:29:32.543 --> 00:29:33.484]  That was September 21st, 2019.
[00:29:33.524 --> 00:29:33.904]  Here's October 11th, 2019.
[00:29:37.335 --> 00:29:38.215]  Tom Nichols, Atlantic.
[00:29:38.515 --> 00:29:39.856]  The impeachable tweets.
[00:29:39.936 --> 00:29:41.597]  Oh, he's begging for impeachment.
[00:29:42.337 --> 00:29:42.777]  Another one.
[00:29:43.397 --> 00:29:47.339]  January 21, Trump's removal is taking too long.
[00:29:47.539 --> 00:29:49.379]  Oh my, he's really out for Trump.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.921]  And then here's June 14, 2022, Tom Nichols.
[00:29:53.121 --> 00:29:54.882]  Leave Joe Biden alone.
[00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:59.903]  Leave Joe Biden alone, says Tom.
[00:30:01.244 --> 00:30:06.546]  Biden's been a good president, but Republicans want to impeach him, and some Democrats want to replace him.
[00:30:07.455 --> 00:30:12.341]  Think about the political persecution and the obstacles that were put in front of Trump.
[00:30:12.921 --> 00:30:17.226]  Two fake impeachment shams and now the January 6th sham.
[00:30:18.127 --> 00:30:27.278]  All during election years to harm Donald Trump and to harm this country.
[00:30:30.031 --> 00:30:32.633]  Democrats putting politics over everything else.
[00:30:33.433 --> 00:30:35.515]  Liberals putting their agenda over everything else.
[00:30:35.995 --> 00:30:38.116]  Big oil responds to Biden's threats.
[00:30:38.557 --> 00:30:40.278]  10 things you can do to ease gas prices.
[00:30:40.698 --> 00:30:43.300]  Lift development restrictions on federal lands and waters.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.022]  Designate critical energy infrastructure projects.
[00:30:46.562 --> 00:30:48.804]  Fix the NEPA permitting process.
[00:30:49.164 --> 00:30:52.766]  Accelerate LNG exports and approve pending LNG applications.
[00:30:53.166 --> 00:30:55.088]  Unlock investment and access to capital.
[00:30:55.448 --> 00:30:57.249]  Dismantle supply chain bottlenecks.
[00:30:57.589 --> 00:30:59.811]  Advance lower carbon energy tax provisions.
[00:31:00.471 --> 00:31:03.112]  Protect competition in the use of refining technologies.
[00:31:03.772 --> 00:31:06.133]  End permitting obstruction on natural gas projects.
[00:31:06.573 --> 00:31:09.014]  Advance the energy workforce of the future.
[00:31:10.294 --> 00:31:23.278]  The American Petroleum Institute put this out with a statement responding to Joe Biden's lies and blame games on what's going on with the record gas prices and the record energy prices.
[00:31:25.185 --> 00:31:30.507]  Now, you may not have understood most of that in the 10 things, I know I didn't, but let me translate it for you.
[00:31:31.308 --> 00:31:33.068]  Biden, get out of the way!
[00:31:33.609 --> 00:31:36.050]  Here's an idea, you want us to help lower gas prices?
[00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:40.491]  Why don't you get the hell out of the way and stop sabotaging the industry?
[00:31:41.632 --> 00:31:51.076]  I'm sorry to tell you, you probably already know this, but even I, as somebody who knows this as good as anybody, am just...
[00:31:52.378 --> 00:31:53.539]  It's depressing, really.
[00:31:53.699 --> 00:32:02.863]  It's depressing how fraudulent and phony our media is, and the lies from our politicians.
[00:32:03.004 --> 00:32:12.809]  It's just... It's really something, and we just covered a lot of it, dealing with the energy crisis and the record high gas prices.
[00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:26.051]   But you know, what's going on with Ukraine and Russia and that situation, it might not be as blatant But, it might even be worse, actually.
[00:32:27.371 --> 00:32:36.354]  Because what's happening to America right now, geopolitically, on the world scale, is not really being properly reported or evaluated.
[00:32:36.974 --> 00:32:38.474]  I'm not seeing it anywhere, actually.
[00:32:39.895 --> 00:32:47.257]  And it's an odd thing because... How do I say this?
[00:32:47.397 --> 00:32:57.587]   It's like, it's so obvious, it's so apparent, You think somebody would have realized it and made a big deal of it and started reporting on it, but no.
[00:32:58.088 --> 00:33:04.012]  The fact that the US is losing the respect of most other world powers right now because of Joe Biden.
[00:33:06.334 --> 00:33:08.555]  I mean, almost no world leaders respect him.
[00:33:09.276 --> 00:33:10.897]  Some won't even answer his phone calls.
[00:33:11.157 --> 00:33:13.099]  Some just blatantly disrespect him.
[00:33:15.701 --> 00:33:27.621]   And all the influence that the US has had on this planet is slowly waning, and the small bit of it that's left, Joe Biden is using it to lie in his own pockets!
[00:33:28.542 --> 00:33:30.202]  Like he's been doing for decades!
[00:33:31.723 --> 00:33:33.964]  But see, the rest of the world is waking up to it, and they're done.
[00:33:36.125 --> 00:33:37.825]  And our country's suffering because of it.
[00:33:38.226 --> 00:33:41.947]  Now, I personally, politically, I don't even mind being an isolationist.
[00:33:42.087 --> 00:33:46.489]  I think America can do just fine on its own, but that's not the planet we live on anymore.
[00:33:48.271 --> 00:33:53.835]  And you can't really be an isolationist anymore, because of the global marketplace.
[00:33:55.677 --> 00:33:57.778]  That's how it's been built.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:14.571]  So when China and Saudi Arabia and Europe and Mexico and Brazil and India, and maybe next it'll be Taiwan, because we got some developments there, when all of them are completely losing respect for America, I guess here's the analogy.
[00:34:15.626 --> 00:34:20.170]  There's a table, there's a world table, where leaders sit down to meet.
[00:34:21.171 --> 00:34:23.473]  America's not getting invited anymore, folks.
[00:34:25.134 --> 00:34:28.177]  Our invitation's getting lost in the mail, if you catch my drift.
[00:34:29.238 --> 00:34:31.880]  We're not there, we're not at the table, we don't have a seat.
[00:34:32.301 --> 00:34:33.482]  Nobody wants to hear from us.
[00:34:34.563 --> 00:34:37.665]  Now, when Trump was there, he had the biggest seat at the head of the table.
[00:34:38.266 --> 00:34:41.269]  Amazing how that's changed in just less than two short years.
[00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:43.269]  So here's what it is.
[00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.590]  Here's the news.
[00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:52.513]  Done all we can, Macron hints at giving up on Ukraine as Putin destroys NATO supplies.
[00:34:52.794 --> 00:34:56.955]  Folks, again, this is another one, it's just, the media, it's such a disaster.
[00:34:58.416 --> 00:35:05.359]  All these weapons that NATO is supposedly trying to send into Ukraine are going into the same ports and Russia's just blowing them up.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.120]  It's just a total waste.
[00:35:09.321 --> 00:35:11.902]  And it's happened, like, half a dozen times now.
[00:35:13.885 --> 00:35:20.311]  And so again, Biden is trying to lug the EU, lug other NATO nations.
[00:35:21.383 --> 00:35:26.365]  Lug other countries into this war in Ukraine against Russia and nobody's taking the bait.
[00:35:26.925 --> 00:35:37.989]  So he's having to buy them off with strategic oil reserves and basically say, hey look, we'll do all the legwork, just give us some lip service along the way.
[00:35:38.650 --> 00:35:46.132]  And that's pretty much been the case, but now even Macron is like, look, this is so bad, I don't even want to give it lip service anymore.
[00:35:47.453 --> 00:35:49.734]  So will other European leaders follow suit?
[00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.111]  It's all Biden, folks.
[00:35:53.212 --> 00:35:57.296]  It's all... And this will come back later.
[00:35:57.496 --> 00:35:58.397]  And I've said this before.
[00:35:59.037 --> 00:36:03.562]  Biden has unofficially and illegally launched a war against Russia in Ukraine.
[00:36:04.142 --> 00:36:06.705]  Now, the good news is he's pretty much already lost.
[00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:09.100]  We don't want that war.
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:10.441]  We don't need a war with Russia.
[00:36:10.601 --> 00:36:11.841]  It's the worst idea ever.
[00:36:12.421 --> 00:36:28.367]  But Biden and some of his criminal cronies like their little piggy bank, their little slush fund operation, their little money laundering operation, their little sex trafficking operation in Ukraine, they don't want to lose that gemstone in their criminal crown that Russia has taken.
[00:36:29.301 --> 00:36:30.402]  That angers Joe Biden.
[00:36:30.982 --> 00:36:31.723]  But they've lost it!
[00:36:31.843 --> 00:36:32.524]  It's done!
[00:36:33.304 --> 00:36:41.751]  So everyone else is abandoning ship here, but Biden is still paying for their loyalty with lip service, and paying Zelensky off as well.
[00:36:43.753 --> 00:36:49.278]  And so more support now, even though all the NATO weapons are getting either captured by Russia or destroyed by Russia.
[00:36:49.858 --> 00:36:50.178]  U.S.
[00:36:50.198 --> 00:36:52.020]  to send heavy guided missiles to Ukraine.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.182]  So there's more missiles going into Ukraine.
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:56.560]  That's just breaking.
[00:36:57.741 --> 00:36:58.461]  That was last night.
[00:36:58.981 --> 00:37:03.122]  Joe Biden announces an additional $1.2 billion in aid for Ukraine.
[00:37:03.542 --> 00:37:07.223]  A day after ranting, I don't want to hear any more of these lies about reckless spending.
[00:37:07.424 --> 00:37:08.404]  Another billion for Ukraine.
[00:37:08.624 --> 00:37:09.564]  Where's the money go?
[00:37:09.804 --> 00:37:10.664]  Nobody knows.
[00:37:10.724 --> 00:37:11.845]  There's no accountability.
[00:37:12.145 --> 00:37:13.305]  There's no oversight.
[00:37:14.466 --> 00:37:15.246]  Nobody has any idea.
[00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:22.228]  Most of the weapons that get over there either end up being destroyed or end up on the black market.
[00:37:25.285 --> 00:37:27.206]  And then where is the money going?
[00:37:27.226 --> 00:37:31.827]  Because there's stories, I've covered them, there's stories like in the Associated Press where they say Ukraine is broke!
[00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:35.908]  They're like, Ukraine has no money, they have no ammunition, they don't know what to do.
[00:37:36.168 --> 00:37:36.409]  Really?
[00:37:36.669 --> 00:37:41.150]  Where's the... I mean, they've proposed over a hundred billion dollars for Ukraine.
[00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:43.091]  Who knows how much is actually gone?
[00:37:43.131 --> 00:37:44.111]  Who knows where it's going?
[00:37:44.151 --> 00:37:45.771]  I mean, it's just, it's total insanity.
[00:37:47.734 --> 00:37:48.696]  And here comes another billion.
[00:37:48.956 --> 00:37:49.957]  Where's the money going?
[00:37:50.098 --> 00:37:52.521]  Ukraine army says they have no money, no weapons?
[00:37:52.561 --> 00:37:53.322]  How can that be?
[00:37:53.943 --> 00:37:54.965]  How is that possible?
[00:37:55.426 --> 00:37:56.387]  Where's it all going?
[00:37:57.008 --> 00:37:57.989]  We have no oversight.
[00:37:58.009 --> 00:38:00.493]  It's being stolen, folks.
[00:38:00.513 --> 00:38:01.455]  It's being stolen.
[00:38:04.177 --> 00:38:04.818]  10% for the big guy.
[00:38:05.398 --> 00:38:06.819]  And so this is the new one.
[00:38:07.179 --> 00:38:12.663]  Miami announces no questions asked gun buyback to take guns off the streets and send them to Ukraine.
[00:38:12.863 --> 00:38:15.525]  They're literally taking American weapons and sending them to Ukraine.
[00:38:16.045 --> 00:38:18.467]  Oh, so I guess the Second Amendment does have a purpose.
[00:38:19.127 --> 00:38:21.509]  I guess those AR-15s do have a purpose.
[00:38:21.529 --> 00:38:25.291]  I guess all those guns Democrats want to get rid of do have a purpose, don't they?
[00:38:26.432 --> 00:38:28.273]  Yeah, they do have a purpose after all.
[00:38:29.274 --> 00:38:30.355]  Purpose for them in Ukraine.
[00:38:32.256 --> 00:38:33.517]  You will never need it though.
[00:38:33.597 --> 00:38:34.117]  They need it.
[00:38:34.137 --> 00:38:36.019]  The globalists need it for their operation in Ukraine.
[00:38:36.059 --> 00:38:39.861]  So disarm American citizens and give them to Ukrainian civilians.
[00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:40.582]  Gotcha.
[00:38:40.682 --> 00:38:41.903]  That's the policy here.
[00:38:42.463 --> 00:38:47.766]  Nicaragua, Nicaragua approves joint military exercise with Russia.
[00:38:48.087 --> 00:38:48.187]  Oh!
[00:38:48.647 --> 00:38:49.668]  How do you like them apples?
[00:38:51.249 --> 00:38:52.730]  Mexico's on Russia's side.
[00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:55.672]  Nicaragua says, basically is inviting the Russian army.
[00:38:55.692 --> 00:38:56.352]  They're excited.
[00:38:57.193 --> 00:38:58.133]  Nicaragua's excited.
[00:38:58.153 --> 00:39:00.015]  This is one of the most exciting things that's happened to them.
[00:39:00.762 --> 00:39:01.843]  Like, oh, Russia's coming in?
[00:39:01.863 --> 00:39:03.483]  They want to do joint military exercises?
[00:39:03.523 --> 00:39:04.164]  Yes, please!
[00:39:04.224 --> 00:39:04.824]  Putin, please!
[00:39:04.864 --> 00:39:05.264]  We love it!
[00:39:05.304 --> 00:39:05.945]  We love the Russians!
[00:39:05.965 --> 00:39:06.745]  Bring them in, yes!
[00:39:08.786 --> 00:39:09.026]  Wow.
[00:39:09.687 --> 00:39:09.827]  Hmm.
[00:39:10.007 --> 00:39:10.927]  Did you see that one coming?
[00:39:11.748 --> 00:39:12.408]  Right down there.
[00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:20.132]  And hell, I mean, I guess the Russian army could just amass in Nicaragua and just start marching north until they get to the southern border.
[00:39:20.212 --> 00:39:21.413]  It's wide open anyway!
[00:39:22.514 --> 00:39:24.295]  What's gonna stop them from doing that?
[00:39:24.355 --> 00:39:25.595]  Did you ever think about that, Libs?
[00:39:27.777 --> 00:39:28.497]  Anybody could do it.
[00:39:29.698 --> 00:39:35.743]   Government German government labels journalist criminal, freezes bank account over Ukraine war reporting in Donbass.
[00:39:36.303 --> 00:39:40.064]  Yeah, this independent journalist is one of the few that are actually there.
[00:39:40.544 --> 00:39:43.665]  Elena Lipp, that's actually there on the scenes.
[00:39:43.825 --> 00:39:54.689]  Folks, look, who knows what's really going on, but everybody in Donbass and that eastern region knows it wasn't Russia that was shelling the cities.
[00:39:54.809 --> 00:39:56.350]  It wasn't Russia that was killing the civilians.
[00:39:56.490 --> 00:39:57.470]  It was Ukraine.
[00:39:59.252 --> 00:40:16.385]  It was Ukraine, and it was NATO, and it was the Azov Battalion, and it was Western Front groups, and they all know it, and they reported on it, and now they're getting shut down, they're getting censored, they're getting their bank accounts frozen, because you're not allowed to report the truth on these situations of war, don't you know?
[00:40:16.465 --> 00:40:20.948]  You have to have the corporate war, you have to have the corrupt wars go on.
[00:40:21.388 --> 00:40:25.792]  People can't know it's Ukraine bombing its own people, then they won't support the war.
[00:40:27.472 --> 00:40:30.993]  Zelensky caught red-handed destroying evidence of Hunter Biden biolab network.
[00:40:31.754 --> 00:40:32.954]  Stories at Infowars.com.
[00:40:33.054 --> 00:40:42.798]  Oh, first they said it's Russian propaganda, then the Pentagon came out and admitted, actually we have 46 biolabs in Ukraine, and now Ukraine has blown them all up, hiding the evidence.
[00:40:43.879 --> 00:40:44.519]  Isn't it fun?
[00:40:44.679 --> 00:40:45.760]  Isn't it fun to be lied to?
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:56.574]   Ukraine threatens to destroy Europe's longest bridge, and it turns out this is actually Western US Uh, strategy, really.
[00:40:56.594 --> 00:41:01.215]  They're trying to pressure Ukraine into blowing up the biggest bridge in the region.
[00:41:03.376 --> 00:41:06.576]  Folks, if they do that, I mean, the whole world will turn against America.
[00:41:06.676 --> 00:41:07.177]  I'm sorry.
[00:41:07.257 --> 00:41:08.657]  It's just, it's just ridiculous.
[00:41:09.557 --> 00:41:12.238]  But hey, it might hurt Russia, so let's blow up that bridge.
[00:41:12.918 --> 00:41:19.559]  Maripool, Deja Vu, Ukraine fighters and civilians trapped in besieged Severn Donetsk chemical plant.
[00:41:19.619 --> 00:41:22.420]  So, another situation, a bunch of Ukrainians being held hostage.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.160]  They're losing the war.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:24.080]  Media tells you they're winning.
[00:41:25.256 --> 00:41:26.077]  And then there's China.
[00:41:26.818 --> 00:41:36.427]  China's President Xi Jinping has signed a directive allowing for a quote-unquote non-war uses of the military, raising concerns it could pave the way for an invasion of Taiwan.
[00:41:36.747 --> 00:41:40.330]  Fears for Taiwan as China lends groundwork for its own special military operation.
[00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:43.894]  Now why are they calling it a non-war or a special military operation?
[00:41:44.474 --> 00:41:47.115]  Because that's the precedent Joe Biden has set in Ukraine.
[00:41:47.475 --> 00:41:58.857]  So China's basically saying if Joe Biden can illegally launch a war against Russia in Ukraine and not tell anybody, we the Chinese military can do the same thing in Taiwan, and now they're getting ready to do it.
[00:41:59.637 --> 00:42:01.578]  Remember that liar Anthony Fauci?
[00:42:02.958 --> 00:42:03.258]  Yeah.
[00:42:04.038 --> 00:42:05.058]  He's got COVID.
[00:42:06.639 --> 00:42:10.960]  It's funny because he's quadruple, quadruple injected.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.620]  He's taken four of the clock shots.
[00:42:13.786 --> 00:42:16.509]  Four of the vades, supposedly, he has.
[00:42:17.670 --> 00:42:19.392]  But let's flash it back, guys.
[00:42:19.432 --> 00:42:25.337]  Don't you remember Anthony Fauci told you how effective and you'd never get COVID if you got the vaccine here in clip three?
[00:42:25.357 --> 00:42:25.738]  Remember this?
[00:42:26.772 --> 00:42:30.735]  When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected.
[00:42:31.055 --> 00:42:35.178]  And when people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected.
[00:42:35.478 --> 00:42:39.581]  And when people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected.
[00:42:39.701 --> 00:42:44.685]  Interesting, because you've taken four injections and you have COVID.
[00:42:45.645 --> 00:42:46.946]  You have COVID.
[00:42:47.607 --> 00:42:56.053]  So either you lied about the vaccine, or the test doesn't work.
[00:42:56.977 --> 00:42:58.098]  Which one is it, Fauci?
[00:42:58.899 --> 00:42:59.539]  Trick question.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:00.580]  Both.
[00:43:02.261 --> 00:43:03.722]  The answer's actually both.
[00:43:04.763 --> 00:43:06.905]  But, I'll give Fauci credit.
[00:43:06.945 --> 00:43:09.547]  He's actually working through his supposed sickness.
[00:43:11.108 --> 00:43:14.831]  And so, here he is, begging for more money.
[00:43:14.871 --> 00:43:16.412]  I mean, this guy is just a rat.
[00:43:16.732 --> 00:43:18.994]  This is just a criminal rat.
[00:43:19.134 --> 00:43:20.555]  A money-grubbing rat.
[00:43:21.396 --> 00:43:26.620]  And so, here he is in clip two, with COVID, begging for more money.
[00:43:27.751 --> 00:43:40.338]  I'm anxious to do the basic clinical and translational research to develop the countermeasures that we have so successfully been part of that process to get us the vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.
[00:43:40.898 --> 00:43:46.581]  As you mentioned in your opening statement, this virus is changing and we need to keep up with it.
[00:43:46.702 --> 00:43:52.625]  In order to do that, we've got to do better with new vaccine platforms, such as nanoparticle vaccines.
[00:43:52.685 --> 00:44:00.669]   We cannot proceed with that unless we get additional funding Importantly, we need to both prevent infection and transmission.
[00:44:01.169 --> 00:44:08.273]  We know that we cannot do that unless we get a highly effective mucosal or intranasal vaccine.
[00:44:08.373 --> 00:44:16.721]   We have a number of projects that will not be able to be funded Unless we do get new resources to continue these funding.
[00:44:17.201 --> 00:44:27.596]  These are challenges that we have that I believe will be letting the American people down if we do not use our scientific capabilities to meet the next challenge of this ever-changing virus.
[00:44:27.956 --> 00:44:28.276]  Thank you.
[00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:38.430]  You know what I would do if I was trying to catch a rat criminal like Fauci, and this should have been done already, so it's probably too late anyway, but you know what?
[00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:40.231]  I would actually say, okay, you know what?
[00:44:40.251 --> 00:44:41.511]  Let's release those funds.
[00:44:42.271 --> 00:44:46.873]  Let's give those funds to Fauci or wherever he says they're going to, and let's follow that money.
[00:44:47.493 --> 00:44:52.555]  How much you want to bet some of that money ends up in Fauci's pocket?
[00:44:53.527 --> 00:44:55.369]  Boy oh boy, I feel pretty confident.
[00:44:55.429 --> 00:45:03.940]  I feel pretty strongly that somehow all these fundings and money initiatives end up in Fauci's pocket.
[00:45:04.481 --> 00:45:06.364]  How did that rat bastard get so rich?
[00:45:06.844 --> 00:45:09.528]  Remember the story that came out?
[00:45:12.125 --> 00:45:19.312]  Basically the NIH or whatever government bureaucracy he was working with was getting hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:45:19.793 --> 00:45:42.077]   Hundreds of millions of dollars for quote-unquote special projects and when transparency groups requested that the allocation of those monies and where those monies went To be made transparent and reported on, they said, I no thank you.
[00:45:42.918 --> 00:45:43.618]  I no thank you.
[00:45:43.678 --> 00:45:44.899]  We will keep it secret.
[00:45:45.259 --> 00:45:47.140]  We will keep our money secret.
[00:45:48.261 --> 00:45:49.862]  Yes, I am Anthony Fauci.
[00:45:50.502 --> 00:45:53.524]  I am the highest paid government employee.
[00:45:53.564 --> 00:45:55.905]  I've been stealing money from you for decades.
[00:45:57.046 --> 00:46:03.830]  I get hundreds of billions of dollars in special projects and I put it all right back in my own little pocket.
[00:46:04.972 --> 00:46:06.993]  I'm very rich and powerful, don't you know?
[00:46:07.073 --> 00:46:07.734]  I'm Fauci.
[00:46:08.914 --> 00:46:10.575]  So he's there begging for more money.
[00:46:10.635 --> 00:46:11.716]  We need more vaccines.
[00:46:11.796 --> 00:46:16.498]  Oh, the vaccine that you said would be safe and effective and was neither safe or effective?
[00:46:16.918 --> 00:46:19.160]  And now he's up there begging for more money?
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.182]  Who would give that rat criminal liar a dime?
[00:46:25.323 --> 00:46:25.923]  Democrats.
[00:46:26.523 --> 00:46:27.144]  That's who.
[00:46:28.064 --> 00:46:32.907]  And I'm sure they will fund whatever project Fauci wants to work on next.
[00:46:34.898 --> 00:46:35.198]  Wow.
[00:46:35.558 --> 00:46:36.679]  So there he is, folks.
[00:46:36.939 --> 00:46:37.820]  He promised you.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.161]  If you get the vaccine, you won't get COVID.
[00:46:40.781 --> 00:46:44.343]  He claims to have had four of them, and now he has COVID.
[00:46:44.403 --> 00:46:45.464]  Not even wearing a mask.
[00:46:45.684 --> 00:46:45.964]  Wow.
[00:46:46.024 --> 00:46:47.605]  Spreading COVID all over the planet, too.
[00:46:47.945 --> 00:46:48.165]  Wow.
[00:46:49.546 --> 00:46:53.989]  Yes, one thing liberals hate is looking into the mirror.
[00:46:55.329 --> 00:46:56.130]  It angers them.
[00:46:57.813 --> 00:46:58.994]  Very much so.
[00:46:59.114 --> 00:47:01.878]  Two things, if you want to anger a liberal, two things you can do.
[00:47:02.298 --> 00:47:05.381]  Tell them the truth, or put a mirror in front of their face.
[00:47:06.543 --> 00:47:09.005]  Two things that anger the liberals like nothing else.
[00:47:10.087 --> 00:47:15.893]  And of course, that's why they're trying to censor libs of TikTok, because libs of TikTok is just a mirror!
[00:47:16.654 --> 00:47:18.056]  A mirror of themselves.
[00:47:19.841 --> 00:47:23.107]  But boy oh boy, they are really obsessed with grooming children.
[00:47:23.167 --> 00:47:24.410]  It is really an odd thing.
[00:47:24.951 --> 00:47:30.221]  So I've got a bunch of these clips from Biden yesterday at a child grooming White House event.
[00:47:30.261 --> 00:47:32.164]  But let's look at some of the news first here.
[00:47:33.663 --> 00:47:34.083]  Breaking!
[00:47:34.244 --> 00:47:37.547]  Biden to ban conversion therapy for gender identity.
[00:47:38.148 --> 00:47:55.587]  Now, folks, I have to tell you here, this is all really confusing to me, and I'm not trying to make a joke, I'm being serious, and it's meant to be that way, but it's so nonsensical, it's so confusing, it's just straight up clown world behavior here.
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:06.562]  And so my best understanding, because I read the bill, or the executive order rather, I read the EO and I read this story and it still makes no sense to me.
[00:48:06.622 --> 00:48:07.142]  Of course not.
[00:48:07.202 --> 00:48:12.083]  Men can be women, women can be men, you can be a man, woman, man, child, bear, pig.
[00:48:12.123 --> 00:48:13.903]  I mean, it's just, so it's just total insanity.
[00:48:14.543 --> 00:48:18.044]  Kids having multiple transgender surgeries or reverse surgeries.
[00:48:18.084 --> 00:48:28.186]   I mean, so my understanding is basically that Biden wants to make it illegal To have what they call conversion therapy.
[00:48:29.027 --> 00:48:31.368]  And again, I'm not trying to be funny here.
[00:48:31.808 --> 00:48:33.028]  None of this makes any sense, folks.
[00:48:33.048 --> 00:48:34.269]  You can go read the executive order.
[00:48:34.289 --> 00:48:35.910]  You can read this story in the Post-Millennial.
[00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:37.570]  I mean, it just scrambles your brain.
[00:48:38.311 --> 00:48:39.231]  And that's the whole point.
[00:48:39.291 --> 00:48:40.492]  Imagine what it's going to do to children.
[00:48:41.952 --> 00:49:18.357]   But my best understanding is that Biden is making it illegal to Have therapies or interventions that would stop a child from having transgender surgery, or like if a child says, hey, you know, a five-year-old says, hey, it's a girl, and says, oh, I'm a boy, I'm a boy, I wanna be a boy, you know, give me top surgery, and it becomes a serious psychological problem with this mental disorder, you can take them to conversion therapy just so that they understand, no, you're a girl, that's what you are.
[00:49:19.724 --> 00:49:21.125]  Or vice versa, whatever the case is.
[00:49:22.886 --> 00:49:34.014]  So that's basically, so Biden is making it illegal or even with gay, like, oh, you know, gay homosexual conversion therapy, like, you know, get you straight again or something like that.
[00:49:34.335 --> 00:49:37.357]  Like he's signed an executive order making all of that illegal.
[00:49:39.949 --> 00:49:46.171]  Again, it's my best understanding, you can try to read it for yourself, it might as well be in another language.
[00:49:46.471 --> 00:49:47.072]  Because it is.
[00:49:47.712 --> 00:49:49.573]  There's men and there's women and that's it.
[00:49:49.973 --> 00:49:52.954]  They start throwing all these other things in there, so it gets confusing.
[00:49:53.394 --> 00:49:58.536]  But this is from the post-millennial story I quote directly, and they're quoting from the bill, or the executive order.
[00:49:59.912 --> 00:50:15.239]  Biden told parents across America to affirm their children, meaning that should a child claim to be what they are not, parents should nod affirmatively and sign them up for irrevocable courses of medical treatment that will prevent them from living a full life.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:21.422]  So in other words, force your kid to be transgender if they even, like a girl wears a basketball jersey or something.
[00:50:21.902 --> 00:50:26.425]  This new order states that so-called conversion therapy must be banned across the country.
[00:50:26.445 --> 00:50:28.966]  So in other words, but it's not just that.
[00:50:30.822 --> 00:50:37.164]  If you try to stop your child from having sexual reassignment surgery, you're now the criminal.
[00:50:38.304 --> 00:50:46.667]  Or if you're a school or a psychologist or anybody that's trying to do this, whether it's homosexuality or trans sex or any of this other stuff, this executive order makes that illegal.
[00:50:49.868 --> 00:50:50.088]  What?
[00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.929]  What is that?
[00:50:53.049 --> 00:51:02.397]  The executive order is intended to mark Pride Month and will prevent so-called conversion therapy with a historic initiative to protect children from the harmful practice.
[00:51:03.458 --> 00:51:05.079]  That's a quote from the executive order.
[00:51:05.359 --> 00:51:08.282]  The harmful practice of not chopping their genitals up.
[00:51:10.203 --> 00:51:13.286]  The harmful practice of not chopping a little boy's penis off.
[00:51:13.706 --> 00:51:16.668]  The harmful practice of not mutilating a little girl's genitals.
[00:51:17.689 --> 00:51:18.690]  That harmful practice.
[00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:26.283]   You want to stop kids from being Having their genitals chopped up, this executive order now labels you a criminal.
[00:51:28.984 --> 00:51:32.546]  As well as safeguarding healthcare and programs designed to prevent youth suicide.
[00:51:33.187 --> 00:51:46.215]  So, in other words, you have a higher likelihood of committing suicide if you are in the transgender community, and they say by doing this they're going to decrease suicide.
[00:51:47.219 --> 00:51:52.181]  So by putting people into the group that has the highest rate of suicide, they're planning on decreasing suicide.
[00:51:53.722 --> 00:51:55.923]  Again, folks, none of it makes sense.
[00:51:56.143 --> 00:51:58.444]  I'm trying my best to make sense of this for you.
[00:51:59.104 --> 00:52:07.308]  It's just more sexual deviancy, more grooming of the children, more perverted pedophilia.
[00:52:08.996 --> 00:52:19.760]  This sweeping executive order requiring federal agencies to comply will issue guidance to states on gender affirmation, which the president believes is essential to protect children.
[00:52:20.961 --> 00:52:26.043]  Chopping up little boys and girls' genitals is essential to protecting children, says Joe Biden.
[00:52:26.403 --> 00:52:28.184]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[00:52:29.004 --> 00:52:33.586]  Here's some of the quotes from his event, his pride event at the White House yesterday.
[00:52:33.626 --> 00:52:35.767]  Guys, just roll me clips 9 through 11.
[00:52:37.659 --> 00:52:41.681]  Violent attacks on the community, including ongoing attacks on transgender women of color.
[00:52:41.941 --> 00:52:42.581]  Mush mouth here.
[00:52:42.601 --> 00:52:43.742]  He's got marbles in his mouth.
[00:52:43.982 --> 00:52:48.364]  Because the attacks are more than ever last year, and they're on pace again this year.
[00:52:49.185 --> 00:52:49.365]  What?
[00:52:49.385 --> 00:52:49.945]  Disgusting.
[00:52:49.965 --> 00:52:50.745]  What does that even mean?
[00:52:50.765 --> 00:52:51.466]  I have to stop.
[00:52:51.546 --> 00:52:52.386]  What is he talking about?
[00:52:52.526 --> 00:52:58.929]  Right now, there are young people sitting in their bedroom, doors closed, silent, scrolling through social media.
[00:52:58.949 --> 00:52:59.149]  Good.
[00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:00.370]  You know what?
[00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.870]  Turn him off.
[00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:02.551]  I can't take this creep, man.
[00:53:02.931 --> 00:53:05.753]  I don't want to hear Joe Biden fantasizing about little kids in bed, okay?
[00:53:05.873 --> 00:53:06.313]  I'm sorry.
[00:53:07.881 --> 00:53:08.361]  I'm sorry.
[00:53:08.922 --> 00:53:10.463]  I don't want to listen to Mush Mouth anymore.
[00:53:10.503 --> 00:53:12.244]  This guy sounds like he's got marble in his mouth.
[00:53:12.524 --> 00:53:14.365]  He's up there fantasizing about kids in bed.
[00:53:14.405 --> 00:53:15.546]  I mean, what a sick freak.
[00:53:16.246 --> 00:53:18.888]  Here he is, guys, give me clip 10 quickly.
[00:53:19.869 --> 00:53:29.855]  Here he is fumbling through, I mean, I don't blame, LGBTQIA, Niner, 69, Topeka, Topeka, Washington, Blue 16, Blue 16, Hut Hut Hike, plus sexual agenda.
[00:53:29.875 --> 00:53:30.856]  Here he is fumbling that.
[00:53:30.876 --> 00:53:40.618]   Let me say, As Commander-in-Chief, I'm proud to have ended the un-American ban on transgender Americans serving in our military.
[00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:49.341]  I mean, honestly, guys, you know, bring me a... That's good.
[00:53:49.742 --> 00:53:53.903]  Bring me a bag of marbles and I'll put them in my mouth and see if I can sound like Joe Biden.
[00:53:55.304 --> 00:53:56.624]  And then here's the First Lady.
[00:53:56.664 --> 00:53:57.924]  She's a complete embarrassment.
[00:53:59.865 --> 00:54:01.746]  She had to get a little word in here, too, in CLEP 11.
[00:54:02.912 --> 00:54:10.739]  In places across the country, like Florida, Texas, or Alabama, rights are under attack.
[00:54:11.199 --> 00:54:11.299]  Oh.
[00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:18.626]  And we know that in small towns and big cities, prejudice and discrimination still lurk.
[00:54:19.246 --> 00:54:19.467]  Uh-huh.
[00:54:20.367 --> 00:54:20.688]  I see.
[00:54:22.349 --> 00:54:22.809]  Okay.
[00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:24.311]  Oh boy, oh boy.
[00:54:24.471 --> 00:54:25.312]  Man, these people.
[00:54:25.512 --> 00:54:28.094]  When will we not have to deal with these demons anymore?
[00:54:28.294 --> 00:54:28.775]  Maybe never.
[00:54:29.867 --> 00:54:32.753]  Michigan Attorney General says drag queens make everything better.
[00:54:33.214 --> 00:54:35.137]  Suggest a drag queen for every school.
[00:54:35.258 --> 00:54:35.939]  Oh, that's nice!
[00:54:35.959 --> 00:54:40.287]  Your local pedophile now works at the school and gets special access to children.
[00:54:41.172 --> 00:54:42.813]  That's Democrat Party policy there.
[00:54:43.654 --> 00:54:44.455]  How's that gonna go?
[00:54:44.495 --> 00:54:45.135]  How about this one?
[00:54:45.515 --> 00:54:51.180]  Idaho police investigating drag queen who may have exposed genitals to children at local LGBT event.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:52.120]  No, not may have.
[00:54:52.541 --> 00:54:52.901]  Did.
[00:54:53.602 --> 00:54:54.722]  And this isn't the first time.
[00:54:54.762 --> 00:54:55.543]  It's not the second time.
[00:54:55.583 --> 00:54:56.504]  It's not the third time.
[00:54:56.864 --> 00:54:59.726]  It's the fourth time that I've seen on camera alone!
[00:55:00.567 --> 00:55:09.354]  It's the fourth time I've seen a male drag queen flash Trousersnake to young kids at a Pride event.
[00:55:10.134 --> 00:55:12.396]  I've seen it on camera four times myself.
[00:55:14.258 --> 00:55:17.241]  Hey, we need to put that in every school, said the pedophile Democrats.
[00:55:17.721 --> 00:55:18.642]  This is how you respond.
[00:55:19.022 --> 00:55:25.508]  Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene announces she is introducing bill to make it illegal for children to be exposed to drag queen performances.
[00:55:25.949 --> 00:55:26.970]  Similar bill in Texas.
[00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:27.751]  This is what you do.
[00:55:28.131 --> 00:55:30.053]  Make Democrats defend this publicly.
[00:55:30.533 --> 00:55:33.595]  Make Democrats publicly defend their pedophilia.
[00:55:34.056 --> 00:55:37.678]  Make Democrats publicly defend their sexual perversions.
[00:55:38.198 --> 00:55:39.659]  Put this out in the public.
[00:55:39.879 --> 00:55:43.822]  They hate you looking at the libs of TikTok account because it shows you what the left is up to.
[00:55:44.082 --> 00:55:46.704]  So let's make the left defend it on a national stage.
[00:55:46.984 --> 00:55:48.245]  Good for Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[00:55:48.725 --> 00:55:52.168]  Electronic sniffing dog helps in pedophile arrest in Mexico.
[00:55:53.271 --> 00:56:00.895]  Yeah, this minor attracted person activist from Europe was down in Mexico City, and they were able to find him.
[00:56:01.195 --> 00:56:03.356]  You know, it's because they say it's minor attracted persons now.
[00:56:03.396 --> 00:56:04.156]  You need to respect them.
[00:56:04.176 --> 00:56:05.057]  And this dog found him.
[00:56:05.257 --> 00:56:07.158]  Can you imagine if this dog was in the Biden house?
[00:56:07.198 --> 00:56:08.259]  He'd probably be going crazy.
[00:56:09.519 --> 00:56:13.501]  You know, there's been an awful lot of talk about extremist behavior here.
[00:56:15.122 --> 00:56:19.264]  And it's funny because we're ignoring the actual violent extremists.
[00:56:19.724 --> 00:56:22.466]  And Democrats are just going after their political opposition.
[00:56:23.602 --> 00:56:30.224]  But of course that's what the terrorists would do, and that's the Democrat Party, the largest terror group in the history of this country.
[00:56:30.884 --> 00:56:35.126]  It continues to operate, and it will continue to be that until it is shut down.
[00:56:36.466 --> 00:56:41.728]  So, they are ready to riot, burn, loot, plunder, assault.
[00:56:43.008 --> 00:56:47.950]  If their Roe vs. Wade decision comes down at any time, they are just ready to go.
[00:56:48.973 --> 00:56:57.437]  The Democrats have their terrorists out in the streets ready to burn, loot, riot, steal, assault, burn churches, burn pregnancy centers.
[00:56:58.977 --> 00:57:01.639]  And it's an odd thing because what is the complaint?
[00:57:02.539 --> 00:57:04.400]  That they can't kill their baby anymore.
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:07.061]  Which is duly odd because 1.
[00:57:08.022 --> 00:57:11.803]  99% of these women are not going to have an abortion so it doesn't affect them at all.
[00:57:12.804 --> 00:57:13.104]  And then 2.
[00:57:13.224 --> 00:57:17.526]  This decision does not ban abortions or make abortions illegal in America.
[00:57:18.433 --> 00:57:22.155]  So the two things they think they're protesting, neither exists.
[00:57:23.656 --> 00:57:25.798]  Typical liberal dumbasses.
[00:57:26.899 --> 00:57:33.543]  But no, they are... Actually, they were in front of Kavanaugh's house last night, again, in front of Kavanaugh's house.
[00:57:35.444 --> 00:57:38.306]  And they have posted two groups in D.C.
[00:57:38.446 --> 00:57:40.087]  actually, two groups in D.C.
[00:57:40.127 --> 00:57:44.410]  right now, getting ready to riot if they think they can't kill their babies anymore.
[00:57:45.885 --> 00:57:47.887]  And that's Shut Down D.C.
[00:57:48.327 --> 00:57:51.909]  Boy, with a name like Shut Down D.C., you'd think the Democrats would be crying insurrection.
[00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:52.810]  They're not.
[00:57:53.831 --> 00:57:55.252]  Because it's their people.
[00:57:55.392 --> 00:57:56.553]  It's their terrorist groups.
[00:57:57.073 --> 00:58:08.562]  And then you have Jane's Revenge, which is openly making statements, openly publishing addresses, openly encouraging violence to pregnancy centers.
[00:58:10.094 --> 00:58:14.137]  I've got the full statement right here that they're posting all over the streets of D.C.
[00:58:14.717 --> 00:58:16.778]  and other areas where they operate.
[00:58:17.599 --> 00:58:22.922]  Full statement from Jane's Revenge announcing that it's open season on pro-life pregnancy centers.
[00:58:23.623 --> 00:58:29.947]  Future measures may not come in the form of something so easily cleaned up as fire and graffiti the terrorist group threatens.
[00:58:30.267 --> 00:58:31.348]  Anything from the FBI?
[00:58:32.168 --> 00:58:33.849]  Anything from the Department of Homeland Security?
[00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:39.092]  Yeah, in fact, guys, do we have a... Let me... It is the Liberal Summer of Rage, after all.
[00:58:39.613 --> 00:58:44.956]  And so, here we are, once again, covering the Liberal Summer of Rage.
[00:58:46.517 --> 00:58:47.097]  Liberal.
[00:58:48.438 --> 00:58:49.199]  Summer of.
[00:58:50.519 --> 00:58:50.880]  Rage.
[00:58:54.022 --> 00:58:54.342]  Ah, yes.
[00:58:55.664 --> 00:58:57.305]  Ah yes, the liberal summer of rage.
[00:58:58.305 --> 00:59:07.490]  And so they're openly saying, we're gonna burn pregnancy centers, we're gonna burn churches, here's our targets, here's our address, we're burning them to the ground, and we might do worse.
[00:59:08.991 --> 00:59:11.532]  Nothing from the FBI, nothing from the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:59:11.572 --> 00:59:13.673]  It's encouraged, in fact, by the Democrat Party.
[00:59:15.026 --> 00:59:23.333]  They've already firebombed more than 10 pregnancy centers since the leak, since the Supreme Court leak, which we still don't have the leaker.
[00:59:23.813 --> 00:59:24.193]  Why not?
[00:59:24.354 --> 00:59:25.434]  Because the leaker's a Democrat.
[00:59:25.815 --> 00:59:33.581]  Far-left pro-abortion group Jane's Revenge issues terroristic threat against pro-life pregnancy centers, and it's ignored by the media.
[00:59:33.641 --> 00:59:36.343]  It's ignored by the Democrats.
[00:59:36.383 --> 00:59:40.286]  It's ignored by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security because they're all in it.
[00:59:40.447 --> 00:59:42.688]  They're all part of the same terrorist group.
[00:59:42.768 --> 00:59:44.190]  It's called the Democrat Party.
[00:59:45.219 --> 00:59:49.403]  Jane's Revenge, Shut Down DC, Weather Underground.
[00:59:49.824 --> 00:59:54.248]  These are all just offshoots of the larger terror group, the Democrat Party.
[00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:57.972]  Pro-abortion group claims responsibility for recent attacks.
[00:59:58.032 --> 00:59:58.953]  Again, they don't even hide it.
[00:59:59.533 --> 01:00:00.514]  They post it right there.
[01:00:00.574 --> 01:00:03.017]  They put it on the buildings that they burned to the ground.
[01:00:03.577 --> 01:00:05.478]  And vandalized, put Jane's Revenge on there.
[01:00:05.838 --> 01:00:06.878]  Anybody investigating that?
[01:00:07.159 --> 01:00:08.079]  Any hearings on that?
[01:00:08.459 --> 01:00:08.979]  Anything on that?
[01:00:09.479 --> 01:00:10.280]  Domestic terror group?
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:10.460]  No.
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.060]  They're Democrats, they're allowed to do it.
[01:00:12.661 --> 01:00:20.404]  And you know, what is with white liberals that love to make black people commit crimes in their agenda?
[01:00:20.444 --> 01:00:21.084]  Have you noticed that?
[01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:24.645]  White liberals love to put black people on the front lines.
[01:00:25.085 --> 01:00:27.927]  White liberals love to have black people commit crimes for them.
[01:00:28.087 --> 01:00:28.847]  Have you ever noticed that?
[01:00:30.435 --> 01:00:34.180]  I don't know why white liberals love using black people to commit crime so much, but they do.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:34.921]  They really do.
[01:00:36.123 --> 01:00:39.367]  And so that's why they're trying to drum up hatred right now in the black community.
[01:00:41.778 --> 01:00:44.198]  And anger if they can't have abortions.
[01:00:44.399 --> 01:00:51.020]  And so here was a story from a Florida source, actually it's from, it's in Tennessee, but it's TampaBay.com.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.661]  Stakes high for black women in states that could ban abortion.
[01:00:55.801 --> 01:00:56.261]  Well, what?
[01:00:56.321 --> 01:00:58.721]  Why would that, why would the stakes be high for black women?
[01:00:59.241 --> 01:01:07.363]  Well, because the vast majority of abortions in this country are black women's abortions, black babies being aborted.
[01:01:08.294 --> 01:01:12.376]  That was the entire purpose of Planned Parenthood, was to eliminate the black population.
[01:01:12.416 --> 01:01:13.457]  Just ask Margaret Sanger.
[01:01:13.817 --> 01:01:20.640]  The entire operational agenda of Planned Parenthood was to eliminate the black population in America, and they've done a great job of it.
[01:01:22.101 --> 01:01:25.063]  40 million black babies murdered by Planned Parenthood, so it's done a good job.
[01:01:25.823 --> 01:01:31.226]  But they say, oh, so that's a bad thing that black babies aren't going to be murdered by their mothers anymore.
[01:01:32.199 --> 01:01:38.640]  And they're all worried about this Dobbs vs. Jackson's Women's Health Organization, this Mississippi case they think is going to be kind of the crutch of the whole thing.
[01:01:39.541 --> 01:01:45.662]  But no, this is Democrats trying to rile up black people to get out in the streets and commit crimes for them again.
[01:01:46.502 --> 01:01:50.783]  White liberals riling up black people to go out in the streets and commit crimes for them.
[01:01:51.923 --> 01:01:52.824]  Really amazing stuff.
[01:01:54.004 --> 01:01:56.664]  Supreme Court riffs divide abortion views in Mississippi.
[01:01:57.105 --> 01:01:58.685]  Yeah, they're making it all about that case.
[01:02:01.201 --> 01:02:03.423]  Abortion, this one, oh this is hilarious, folks.
[01:02:03.463 --> 01:02:04.684]  This is, oh my gosh.
[01:02:05.064 --> 01:02:05.865]  This is from Bloomberg.
[01:02:05.925 --> 01:02:07.827]  I had a good laugh at this last night, let me tell you.
[01:02:08.568 --> 01:02:11.470]  Abortion care workers, abortion care.
[01:02:12.031 --> 01:02:13.272]  Care, don't you love care?
[01:02:13.592 --> 01:02:14.132]  What care?
[01:02:14.373 --> 01:02:15.113]  No, it's abortion.
[01:02:16.134 --> 01:02:19.897]  But see, they know abortion is murder, so now they're trying to murder care.
[01:02:20.934 --> 01:02:22.054]  Murder care workers.
[01:02:22.534 --> 01:02:22.834]  Care.
[01:02:22.854 --> 01:02:23.655]  They love throwing the care.
[01:02:23.675 --> 01:02:27.155]  They have their little words that they try to gloss over what they're really up to.
[01:02:27.195 --> 01:02:28.956]  It's murder, so they call it abortion care.
[01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:29.776]  Hmm.
[01:02:29.976 --> 01:02:31.516]  You know, murder sounds really bad.
[01:02:31.596 --> 01:02:32.776]  Most people don't like murder.
[01:02:33.076 --> 01:02:33.857]  It's not really good.
[01:02:33.877 --> 01:02:36.757]  It's not really going over well in our think groups and our think tanks.
[01:02:36.917 --> 01:02:37.837]  What can we do?
[01:02:38.077 --> 01:02:40.398]  We can't call it murder, so what should we call it?
[01:02:40.598 --> 01:02:41.838]  Let's call it abortion care.
[01:02:42.058 --> 01:02:42.538]  Brilliant.
[01:02:43.178 --> 01:02:44.139]  Brilliant strategy.
[01:02:44.499 --> 01:02:45.399]  Abortion care.
[01:02:47.262 --> 01:02:50.403]  Abortion care workers look to unionize.
[01:02:50.744 --> 01:02:50.864]  Oh!
[01:02:52.304 --> 01:02:53.585]  As Roe decision approaches.
[01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:55.265]  Now this, folks, it gets better.
[01:02:55.926 --> 01:02:58.787]  Employees at abortion clinics are dealing with burnout.
[01:02:59.147 --> 01:02:59.887]  They're burnt out.
[01:03:00.108 --> 01:03:01.368]  They've committed so many murders.
[01:03:01.408 --> 01:03:02.028]  They're burnt out.
[01:03:02.809 --> 01:03:03.869]  And exhaustion.
[01:03:04.629 --> 01:03:06.410]  Just as reproductive rights in the U.S.
[01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.431]  are hanging by a thread.
[01:03:07.511 --> 01:03:08.111]  Wait a second.
[01:03:08.151 --> 01:03:08.511]  Hold on.
[01:03:08.591 --> 01:03:09.492]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[01:03:09.572 --> 01:03:10.292]  I'm confused here.
[01:03:11.783 --> 01:03:17.887]  You're suffering from burnout and exhaustion, but you're complaining that there's no abortions happening anymore.
[01:03:19.208 --> 01:03:24.952]  You're complaining that you work too much, and so therefore you want more abortions?
[01:03:25.853 --> 01:03:28.394]  I'm just trying to, this is, this is their logic.
[01:03:30.276 --> 01:03:33.258]  And so they're unionizing so they can have more abortions?
[01:03:34.539 --> 01:03:34.759]  What?
[01:03:35.119 --> 01:03:47.209]   Their burnout because they've had so many abortions, Even though they're complaining that there's not enough abortions, and they're afraid that there might not be any more abortions, but they're complaining about how they're tired of so many abortions?
[01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:52.811]  I don't have it, folks.
[01:03:52.932 --> 01:03:53.952]  I don't have this logic.
[01:03:54.012 --> 01:03:54.813]  It's liberal logic.
[01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:57.274]  You try to make sense of it, but there it is.
[01:03:59.175 --> 01:04:08.302]  So murder workers, excuse me, abortion care workers are burnt out from working so much with the abortions, so they're unionizing so there can be more abortions.
[01:04:08.782 --> 01:04:11.284]  I tell ya, you just... More liberal summer of rage.
[01:04:11.584 --> 01:04:15.306]  Boston BDS map of Jewish groups has potential to incite violence.
[01:04:15.507 --> 01:04:19.990]  Yeah, it's the pro-Palestine left that hates Jews and Israel.
[01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:23.393]  It's funny, because you have the anti-Israel left and the anti-Israel right.
[01:04:23.673 --> 01:04:29.318]  The anti-Israel right doesn't like Israel's influence in the West and doesn't like the Jewish influence in a Christian nation.
[01:04:30.098 --> 01:04:36.383]  The anti-Israel left just hates Israel, hates Jews, and wants to see it burned to the ground and is pro-Palestine.
[01:04:37.664 --> 01:04:39.346]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:39.406 --> 01:04:40.607]  Oh, Radicals in Wisconsin!
[01:04:40.647 --> 01:04:43.629]  Vandalized site of Tuesday night's fundraiser for GOP candidate.
[01:04:43.709 --> 01:04:44.730]  Oh, more liberal terrorism!
[01:04:45.030 --> 01:04:46.532]  This is an inflation under control.
[01:04:48.124 --> 01:04:50.651]  So the question is about gas prices and inflation.
[01:04:50.671 --> 01:04:51.634]  You know what I could do?
[01:04:52.035 --> 01:04:55.063]  If you could give me a time machine to go back to January 20, 2021.
[01:04:58.601 --> 01:05:03.165]  We would just do the opposite of what Biden has done and we'd be in a better spot.
[01:05:03.206 --> 01:05:15.678]  No, I mean, I really think it's, it's got, he's got a lot of chutzpah to attack energy producers when he campaigned saying he was going to shut down energy production in the United States.
[01:05:15.958 --> 01:05:17.499]  He said, we're not going to let him drill.
[01:05:17.519 --> 01:05:18.700]  We're not going to give leases.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.022]  We're not going to do any of that.
[01:05:20.402 --> 01:05:37.175]  And so then he comes in, he puts really negative policies to try to kneecap American energy production, and of course that's been a huge driver as to why we now have gas higher than we have ever seen it before in my lifetime in this country.
[01:05:37.495 --> 01:05:43.420]  And so he has facilitated this, and I think that's had a huge impact on overall inflation.
[01:05:44.641 --> 01:05:47.083]  Ron DeSantis telling it like it is.
[01:05:48.507 --> 01:05:49.488]  Telling it like it is.
[01:05:50.169 --> 01:05:54.753]  And Elon Musk came out and basically said he'd like to see Ron DeSantis run for president.
[01:05:55.053 --> 01:05:55.774]  He'd vote for him.
[01:05:56.635 --> 01:06:02.741]  Elon Musk also was proud of voting for Mayra Flores on her recent election victory.
[01:06:03.161 --> 01:06:06.925]  And this has the left in an absolute uproar.
[01:06:07.706 --> 01:06:09.668]  But we'll have more on that coming up.
[01:06:10.663 --> 01:06:16.267]  But yeah, the Democrats, Joe Biden, they are intentionally collapsing the U.S.
[01:06:16.287 --> 01:06:18.649]  They are intentionally sabotaging our energy.
[01:06:19.290 --> 01:06:26.175]  It's an operation from within to destroy our great country.
[01:06:27.696 --> 01:06:28.757]  And I hope they don't succeed.
[01:06:30.538 --> 01:06:44.053]   Of course I hope they don't succeed, but you've noticed Some of the signs and the symptoms of this right now, with the record high gas prices, the grocery bill going up, the energy bill going up, all these other factors.
[01:06:44.854 --> 01:06:49.918]  And so people are looking and they're realizing, wow, this is actually a lot worse than I thought it would be.
[01:06:49.978 --> 01:06:52.540]  Biden is a bigger disaster than I thought he would be.
[01:06:53.301 --> 01:07:01.796]   And so they're trying to Make plans, if you will, for the future, just not knowing what might come.
[01:07:02.236 --> 01:07:07.619]  And so a lot more people are realizing, boy, I should probably have an emergency food supply.
[01:07:08.837 --> 01:07:16.163]  Considering that, under Joe Biden, this country might turn into a third world hellhole like Venezuela, I should probably at least have some emergency food.
[01:07:16.223 --> 01:07:25.571]  So, we see this demand, we see this necessity rising, we see this awareness, and we are answering the bell at preparetoday.com.

[01:08:33.086 --> 01:08:38.287]  A collapse of the supply chain, which seems inevitable as it's getting worse and worse at the grocery stores.

[01:08:48.837 --> 01:09:07.065]   And part of this disaster is the wide-open southern border where the Democrats continue to facilitate an invasion By the tens of thousands every day, and by the multi-millions every year.
[01:09:07.225 --> 01:09:09.186]  Allie Bradley is down there reporting at the border.
[01:09:09.406 --> 01:09:11.487]  She has some latest photos now.
[01:09:11.527 --> 01:09:21.129]  They're renting nice, beautiful, big private buses, paid for by the taxpayer, to shuttle the illegal immigrants all over the country, wherever they may want to go.
[01:09:21.209 --> 01:09:22.410]  You're paying for the whole thing.
[01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:23.790]  You're paying for your own invasion.
[01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:26.751]  It's really an unbelievable thing, actually.
[01:09:26.791 --> 01:09:29.832]  It's kind of hard to even believe this is going on, but it is.
[01:09:29.852 --> 01:09:30.692]  It's so outrageous.
[01:09:32.073 --> 01:09:34.935]  The local NGOs are feeling the influx of migrants.
[01:09:35.455 --> 01:09:39.418]  Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition in Del Rio had a little help Monday.
[01:09:40.379 --> 01:09:48.104]  Three charter buses, three DC buses, three shuttle buses, two Greyhound buses, one great out-of-town volunteer group.
[01:09:49.405 --> 01:09:53.528]  And, uh, yeah, I mean, they have so many illegal immigrants coming in, they don't know what to do with them.
[01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:56.542]  Yeah, they can fly them around the country.
[01:09:56.582 --> 01:10:00.763]  Yeah, they can put them up in hotels, but they're running out of space in the hotels.
[01:10:01.203 --> 01:10:06.065]  They've already filled up all the local Catholic charity groups' buildings.
[01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:07.226]  They can't fit anymore there.
[01:10:07.266 --> 01:10:10.287]  They filled up all the hotels in the southern Texas counties.
[01:10:11.327 --> 01:10:13.188]  And flying is a bear right now.
[01:10:13.268 --> 01:10:15.569]  Flying's a pain in the butt, so they can't really fly them anywhere.
[01:10:15.649 --> 01:10:18.690]  So they're just getting them nice private buses to fly them wherever they want now.
[01:10:18.890 --> 01:10:21.291]  Excuse me, to drive them wherever they want now.
[01:10:23.983 --> 01:10:25.084]  I'm at a loss on this one.
[01:10:26.705 --> 01:10:30.548]  I cannot understand how this is going on.
[01:10:31.308 --> 01:10:34.891]  There's something real sinister behind this, folks.
[01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:39.694]  We have an idea, I think, of what's going on and we know the agenda.
[01:10:41.889 --> 01:10:56.857]  But, I'm telling you, this is so out of control, and the lack of response, the lack of accountability, the lack of urgency when it comes to the invasion of the southern border, this, is everyone involved in this?
[01:10:58.357 --> 01:11:00.539]  Seriously, like, is everyone involved in this?
[01:11:01.099 --> 01:11:04.701]  Is everyone making money off of this wide open southern border?
[01:11:05.221 --> 01:11:16.000]   I can't fathom how I can sit here every day And play hours of footage of tens of thousands of illegal immigrants pouring over the southern border.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:20.102]  All paid for, all organized, all orchestrated.
[01:11:21.022 --> 01:11:22.683]  How is that even possible?
[01:11:23.003 --> 01:11:26.304]  How can that... Where in the hell does that even go on?
[01:11:26.784 --> 01:11:28.925]  When has that even happened in world history?
[01:11:32.226 --> 01:11:33.046]  I'm at a loss, folks.
[01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:37.608]  I'm just... I cannot fathom how this is really going on.
[01:11:38.488 --> 01:11:39.769]  And we just sit here and take it?
[01:11:40.745 --> 01:11:55.810]  I mean, this would be like if somebody came up to you with like a butcher's knife or a steak knife and stabbed you right in the side of your body and you just had a gaping wound bleeding out.
[01:11:58.371 --> 01:12:00.592]  Someone said, hey, you got a gaping wound there and you said, oh really?
[01:12:00.632 --> 01:12:01.132]  Where's that?
[01:12:01.212 --> 01:12:04.773]  And you looked at it and then you said, hey, maybe I should open it up a little wider, maybe.
[01:12:05.873 --> 01:12:07.734]  Maybe you think you can help me open this up a little wider?
[01:12:08.919 --> 01:12:11.400]  And then the person he's saying that to says, yeah, actually I will help.
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.041]  Yeah, here, let me stab you again, actually.
[01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:14.082]  Wait, what?
[01:12:14.122 --> 01:12:15.102]  Like, how is this even?
[01:12:16.363 --> 01:12:17.203]  It's insane, man.
[01:12:17.443 --> 01:12:21.325]  The southern border situation is insane.
[01:12:22.506 --> 01:12:22.986]  Insane.
[01:12:24.327 --> 01:12:24.927]  Three U.S.
[01:12:24.967 --> 01:12:29.429]  women had fentanyl hidden inside their bodies, Border Patrol says.
[01:12:30.230 --> 01:12:35.682]   So yeah, the continuation of The deadly fentanyl drug that killed George Floyd.
[01:12:35.722 --> 01:12:36.223]  I mean, huh.
[01:12:37.084 --> 01:12:37.945]  My brother, George.
[01:12:38.066 --> 01:12:38.566]  My brother!
[01:12:39.347 --> 01:12:41.450]  My brother, George Floyd, killed by the fentanyl.
[01:12:43.914 --> 01:12:45.015]  Killed by the open border.
[01:12:45.055 --> 01:12:45.576]  George Floyd.
[01:12:45.596 --> 01:12:46.137]  Can you believe that?
[01:12:47.486 --> 01:12:49.467]  I mean, obviously liberals know that.
[01:12:50.128 --> 01:12:53.730]  They rioted for an entire summer because George Floyd was killed by the fentanyl overdose.
[01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.690]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:12:55.431 --> 01:12:56.051]  I'm mistaking.
[01:12:56.091 --> 01:12:58.273]  That was Democrat terrorism because they hate police.
[01:12:58.593 --> 01:12:59.073]  I'm sorry.
[01:12:59.593 --> 01:13:00.434]  I get them confused.
[01:13:00.454 --> 01:13:01.715]  I thought they were rational for a second.
[01:13:02.755 --> 01:13:06.377]  No, they don't care about George Floyd dying from a drug overdose.
[01:13:06.898 --> 01:13:08.399]  That doesn't really help them.
[01:13:09.339 --> 01:13:10.580]  That doesn't really fit their agenda.
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:13.322]  That doesn't really add fuel to their rage.
[01:13:14.158 --> 01:13:16.139]  But a policeman killing George Floyd?
[01:13:16.159 --> 01:13:17.240]  Ooh!
[01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:19.161]  Now that they can get behind!
[01:13:19.421 --> 01:13:22.263]  They hate the police, so the anti-police agenda, that works.
[01:13:22.883 --> 01:13:28.246]  The police officer who happened to be white, they hate white people, so okay, that works for their anti-white agenda as well.
[01:13:29.146 --> 01:13:30.667]  So this is all going good for them.
[01:13:31.728 --> 01:13:36.110]  And now they can blame an unarmed black man's death on a white police officer?
[01:13:36.651 --> 01:13:38.652]  Ching, ching, ching, ching, ching, baby!
[01:13:38.732 --> 01:13:39.572]  Money, money, money!
[01:13:39.632 --> 01:13:40.333]  Let's go!
[01:13:40.473 --> 01:13:42.234]  Burn, loot, riot, do it all!
[01:13:43.302 --> 01:13:49.286]  But, oh, if it's George Floyd dies from fentanyl overdose, well, that really doesn't help them, does it?
[01:13:49.986 --> 01:13:50.947]  There's no agenda there.
[01:13:51.607 --> 01:13:54.349]  Fentanyl comes from the wide-open southern border that they love so much.
[01:13:54.869 --> 01:13:56.470]  A black man dying from a drug overdose?
[01:13:56.490 --> 01:13:57.390]  They don't want that.
[01:13:59.111 --> 01:13:59.652]  Jeez.
[01:14:00.232 --> 01:14:00.952]  And what happens?
[01:14:01.693 --> 01:14:06.396]  The human trafficking, multiple victims of human trafficking operation, rescued in Akron, Ohio.
[01:14:06.736 --> 01:14:07.876]  You think they were bussed up there?
[01:14:08.557 --> 01:14:11.759]  Bussed up there in a Greyhound to be sex slaves with the open border?
[01:14:12.637 --> 01:14:16.580]  Well this one slipped through the cracks, but the crew had my back.
[01:14:17.821 --> 01:14:23.646]  Freeport LNG not to resume full operations until late 2022 after fire at facility.
[01:14:23.906 --> 01:14:24.026]  Oh!
[01:14:25.107 --> 01:14:25.487]  Wow!
[01:14:26.908 --> 01:14:32.253]  Another fire burns down an important facility in America.
[01:14:32.353 --> 01:14:41.020]  So now it's not just the food sector or the fertilizer sector, but the energy sector as well.
[01:14:42.523 --> 01:14:43.264]  Very nice.
[01:14:43.504 --> 01:14:44.124]  Very good.
[01:14:44.224 --> 01:14:45.325]  Fire burns it down.
[01:14:46.326 --> 01:14:46.846]  All right.
[01:14:47.627 --> 01:14:49.348]  Everything collapsing in Biden's America.
[01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:52.410]  Everything collapsing.
[01:14:55.152 --> 01:14:58.335]  And how are those vaccines going for ya?
[01:14:58.495 --> 01:14:59.376]  Not so well.
[01:14:59.556 --> 01:15:00.456]  Not so good.
[01:15:01.257 --> 01:15:06.041]  Representative Maxine Waters tests positive for COVID for second time this year!
[01:15:07.722 --> 01:15:07.902]  Hmm.
[01:15:08.763 --> 01:15:09.243]  Mm-mm-mm.
[01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:14.003]  It's almost like that vaccine reset your immune system, and now you don't have one.
[01:15:15.104 --> 01:15:21.489]  Maybe that's why she was all bug-eyed, that bug-eyed freak, in that TV interview.
[01:15:21.589 --> 01:15:23.691]  What a psychotic maniac.
[01:15:24.331 --> 01:15:25.993]  Maxine Waters, look out.
[01:15:27.154 --> 01:15:28.515]  You see her on the streets, folks?
[01:15:30.176 --> 01:15:30.536]  Look out!
[01:15:32.578 --> 01:15:34.920]  And remember, who pays for these cowboys?
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.382]  I mean, this woman is just a dingbat lunatic.
[01:15:38.638 --> 01:15:40.901]  Claiming that Border Patrol is whipping people?
[01:15:40.961 --> 01:15:41.501]  Well, okay.
[01:15:42.322 --> 01:15:43.223]  All right, Maxine.
[01:15:43.444 --> 01:15:44.845]  How's that vaccine working for you?
[01:15:45.546 --> 01:15:46.748]  Maxine vaccine.
[01:15:47.128 --> 01:15:48.289]  COVID, two times in a year.
[01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:55.678]  FDA advisors recommend emergency authorization for Moderna's COVID-19 shot in young kids.
[01:15:56.835 --> 01:15:58.257]  Six months to five years.
[01:15:58.957 --> 01:16:01.119]  They gotta get those young kids blood clotted up.
[01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:03.902]  They gotta clog up those young kids arteries.
[01:16:04.823 --> 01:16:07.826]  They gotta give those young kids a little Guillain-Barré.
[01:16:08.006 --> 01:16:09.668]  It's not all for Justin and Hailey Bieber.
[01:16:09.768 --> 01:16:12.871]  After all, you can suffer from blood clots and face paralysis too.
[01:16:13.412 --> 01:16:15.574]  Give your kid a COVID vaccine shot today.
[01:16:16.875 --> 01:16:18.397]  But oh, oh, oh, so...
[01:16:19.718 --> 01:16:24.621]  It's amazing that we can't figure out what's going on, all these anomalies directly tied into the vaccine.
[01:16:24.962 --> 01:16:25.642]  Here's another one.
[01:16:26.122 --> 01:16:30.205]  This is, folks, this is just, it's really sad, actually.
[01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.707]  It's really sad this is being done to children.
[01:16:34.048 --> 01:16:46.396]  And, you know, I have an instinct to protect innocent children, and it's something that I can't even really avoid.
[01:16:48.203 --> 01:16:55.767]  Whether it's abortion or whether it's with this vaccine stuff, because I can understand the argument, the perspective.
[01:16:56.007 --> 01:17:00.970]  I can fully comprehend and understand of the people that would say, hey, let them do it.
[01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:02.371]  People want to kill their kids.
[01:17:02.411 --> 01:17:04.512]  People want to shoot their kids up with poison.
[01:17:04.552 --> 01:17:05.332]  Let them do it, man.
[01:17:06.213 --> 01:17:06.693]  Let them do it.
[01:17:06.733 --> 01:17:07.394]  None of your business.
[01:17:08.564 --> 01:17:13.147]  While I understand that, I can't help my instinct to protect innocent children, so this breaks my heart.
[01:17:14.027 --> 01:17:25.773]  Children are being infected with up to three viruses at a time because COVID measures have worn down their immune systems and made them vulnerable to illnesses usually only caught in winter.
[01:17:27.814 --> 01:17:33.618]  Health experts across the United States have told the Washington Post that they are seeing children with multiple viral infections at once.
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:40.184]  As the weather warms, doctors usually see a decrease in the prevalence of influenza and other viruses associated with the common cold.
[01:17:40.605 --> 01:17:45.168]  Now some children are arriving at their doctor's office with three viral infections at the same time.
[01:17:45.608 --> 01:17:49.111]  Experts believe that it is a result of COVID pandemic policies.
[01:17:50.412 --> 01:17:51.012]  Yeah, the vaccine.
[01:17:51.272 --> 01:17:54.135]  Which meant children were not exposed to the normal array of viruses.
[01:17:54.915 --> 01:18:06.628]   Well, whether it's the vaccines killing their immune system, which we know is going on, Or the COVID measures that kept kids locked inside for a year so they didn't have a strong immune system.
[01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:09.311]  It was the COVID response either way.
[01:18:10.232 --> 01:18:11.974]  So that's true.
[01:18:13.516 --> 01:18:15.878]  Now is it children that are vaccinated?
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.622]  Is it children that are vaccinated having these problems?
[01:18:19.862 --> 01:18:22.826]  Now here's the other thing about this to me.
[01:18:25.424 --> 01:18:27.587]  You know, we do all this COVID testing.
[01:18:27.627 --> 01:18:29.190]  Of course you're going to have high COVID numbers.
[01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:30.952]  Who knows if the test results are real or not.
[01:18:31.053 --> 01:18:34.458]  You could do that with any disease on the planet, I believe.
[01:18:36.525 --> 01:18:38.906]  I believe you could do that with any disease on the planet.
[01:18:39.446 --> 01:18:41.327]  You ramp up, you test everybody, guess what?
[01:18:41.347 --> 01:18:44.829]  You're going to have a 500% increase of that disease just because you tested everybody.
[01:18:45.269 --> 01:18:52.152]  So, they're testing these kids, but who knows if they always had the virus or it just shows up positive or so.
[01:18:52.472 --> 01:18:55.373]  So there's still kind of some gray area there to me.
[01:18:56.073 --> 01:18:59.435]  But what's clear is that kids are getting sicker than they ever have.
[01:19:00.802 --> 01:19:10.007]  And it is because of the pandemic response, either shutting kids into their houses for a year or forcing them to take the vaccine that kills their immune system.
[01:19:11.548 --> 01:19:16.151]  Kids infected with more viruses after lockdown due to weakened immune systems.
[01:19:16.171 --> 01:19:18.132]  Well, is it the weakened immune system because of lockdown?
[01:19:18.252 --> 01:19:21.694]  Is it a weakened immune system because of the vaccine?
[01:19:22.294 --> 01:19:36.371]   But you know, here's the Here's kind of the, I don't know if you would say scary, but the unknown factor here is that they made COVID-19 in a lab and they released it.
[01:19:38.472 --> 01:19:43.297]  So if they're willing to do that and lie about that and cover that up, what else are they up to?
[01:19:43.757 --> 01:19:45.659]  What else are they releasing that we don't know about?
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:55.165]  There's all kinds of unnatural, inorganic things that the globalists are doing to this planet right now that we don't even know about.
[01:19:56.006 --> 01:19:57.607]  Yeah, we know about they poison the water.
[01:19:57.647 --> 01:19:59.188]  Yeah, we know about they poison the air.
[01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:01.230]  Yeah, we know about they poison the vaccines.
[01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:03.912]  Yeah, we know about they make viruses in a lab and release them.
[01:20:04.452 --> 01:20:06.714]  What else are they doing that we don't know about?
[01:20:07.796 --> 01:20:09.217]  Yeah, the GMOs and the food.
[01:20:09.257 --> 01:20:09.757]  Yeah, okay.
[01:20:10.118 --> 01:20:11.679]  I mean, what else is going on?
[01:20:11.779 --> 01:20:22.546]  So, stories like this that seem to kind of have the obvious answer, but maybe not so much, remind me that, you know, there's always something else going on that we probably don't even know about.
[01:20:22.786 --> 01:20:24.507]  There's all these globalist operations.
[01:20:24.547 --> 01:20:25.268]  Who knows what they're doing?
[01:20:25.288 --> 01:20:26.829]  Who knows how many viruses they've released?
[01:20:27.009 --> 01:20:28.770]  Who knows what's really going on at the southern border?
[01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:31.552]  It's like, yeah, we know what's going on.
[01:20:31.592 --> 01:20:32.953]  What's the story behind the story?
[01:20:34.938 --> 01:20:38.901]  Every state but Florida pre-ordered COVID-19 vaccines for kids under 5.
[01:20:40.142 --> 01:20:40.843]  Good for Florida.
[01:20:41.083 --> 01:20:44.105]  So Florida won't be jabbing their kids to death.
[01:20:44.746 --> 01:20:46.027]  And they'll be the healthiest state.
[01:20:46.047 --> 01:20:46.467]  You watch.
[01:20:46.487 --> 01:20:52.792]  40-year-old British Columbia man diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome is awarded compensation for vaccine injury.
[01:20:53.513 --> 01:20:55.374]  That's the same thing that happened to Justin Bieber.
[01:20:56.315 --> 01:21:00.518]  Perhaps a little variation of the same facial paralysis that happened to Justin Bieber.
[01:21:00.538 --> 01:21:02.680]  But he's not allowed to say it's the vaccine.
[01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:05.632]  Because he'll lose his record deal, I'm sure.
[01:21:05.712 --> 01:21:07.994]  So he just says, oh, maybe I'll be fine, I don't know.
[01:21:09.535 --> 01:21:11.076]  They hit you with the vaccine, Justin.
[01:21:11.977 --> 01:21:12.997]  And you know what, Justin?
[01:21:14.999 --> 01:21:17.501]  You have made so much money in your life.
[01:21:19.162 --> 01:21:21.464]  And you have a great wife.
[01:21:23.285 --> 01:21:25.587]  Just, why don't you just do the right thing, Justin?
[01:21:26.988 --> 01:21:28.630]  Tell people it was the vaccine.
[01:21:29.650 --> 01:21:31.792]  That caused you to not be able to perform again.
[01:21:32.252 --> 01:21:36.976]  Because what difference does it make with a record label if you can't perform?
[01:21:39.578 --> 01:21:40.659]  What, millions of dollars?
[01:21:40.679 --> 01:21:42.040]  You already got millions of dollars.
[01:21:44.242 --> 01:21:49.526]  So maybe there's something else there that we don't know, but I mean, come on.
[01:21:50.507 --> 01:22:03.551]   Justin Bieber magically gets the second, the second highest Rate of vaccine side effect is Guillain-Barre syndrome, facial paralysis.
[01:22:03.591 --> 01:22:05.632]  Justin Bieber gets that and it's not the vaccine.
[01:22:05.732 --> 01:22:06.413]  Give me a break.
[01:22:07.754 --> 01:22:08.454]  Give me a break.
[01:22:09.575 --> 01:22:10.776]  I feel bad for Justin Bieber.
[01:22:12.557 --> 01:22:14.078]  But Justin, you've got plenty of money.
[01:22:14.398 --> 01:22:15.539]  You don't need a record label.
[01:22:15.559 --> 01:22:18.081]  You've got a wife and everything.
[01:22:18.341 --> 01:22:20.202]  Just come out and tell the truth, man.
[01:22:21.843 --> 01:22:22.584]  Just tell the truth.
[01:22:24.867 --> 01:22:33.370]  MSN highlights survey showing severe COVID-19 rare and unvaccinated after months of safe and effective propaganda.
[01:22:33.450 --> 01:22:34.270]  Oh, that's right!
[01:22:37.912 --> 01:22:42.973]  Oh, but see, look, Justin Bieber's concerts forced you to get a vaccine to attend.
[01:22:44.174 --> 01:22:45.314]  How ironic.
[01:22:46.514 --> 01:22:50.576]  But now you can't attend Justin Bieber concerts because of the vaccine.
[01:22:52.364 --> 01:22:55.151]  It is just a wild time to see reality for what it is, isn't it?
[01:22:56.786 --> 01:22:57.887]  But no, back to this story.
[01:22:57.967 --> 01:23:03.669]  MSN highlights survey showing severe COVID-19 rare and unvaccinated after months of safe and effective propaganda.
[01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:25.499]  Yeah, so it's the vaccinated that are getting sick, it's the vaccinated that are getting really sick, it's the vaccinated that are getting sick multiple times, and it's the unvaccinated, rather non-vaccinated, that are not getting sick, not having severe effects, not being bedridden for a week, not needing to go to the hospital, still have an immune system, not having blood clots, not having facial paralysis.
[01:23:27.941 --> 01:23:29.121]  Sad but true, isn't it?
[01:23:29.982 --> 01:23:33.723]  It turned out the people that refused the vaccine were the smartest people on the planet.
[01:23:36.364 --> 01:23:43.746]  And you know, there's that meme, I don't know what you call it, I think there's actually a word for the actual structure of this intellectual hierarchy.
[01:23:44.824 --> 01:23:52.447]  Where on the two ends, you have like the lowest level IQ and the highest level IQ, and they typically seem to be simpatico.
[01:23:52.667 --> 01:23:54.288]  They seem to be synced up.
[01:23:54.648 --> 01:24:00.270]  And then you have most of the people that are just on the average end of the IQ spectrum up here, and they're the most brainwashed.
[01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:10.954]  They're the ones that fall for all the propaganda, do whatever they're told, and then it's the highest IQ and the lowest IQ that seem to have the instincts to know when they're being attacked and to know when something is wrong.
[01:24:11.654 --> 01:24:13.575]  Those are the two groups that avoided the vaccine.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:19.021]  And now they're the two groups that will inherit the earth, the meek shall inherit the earth, as the Bible said.
[01:24:19.061 --> 01:24:20.461]  Now, I feel bad.
[01:24:20.601 --> 01:24:24.382]  I don't mean this to be ridiculing of people that have had the vaccine, that are tuned in.
[01:24:24.722 --> 01:24:29.643]  I don't want to scare you with all the side effects, but I just call it as it is, folks.
[01:24:29.683 --> 01:24:30.823]  That's what we do here at InfoWars.
[01:24:31.283 --> 01:24:43.545]  We have a mental health crisis in this country that is leading to so many of the other crises, including, sadly, some of these mass shootings, if not all of them.
[01:24:45.137 --> 01:24:46.577]  It's a mental health problem.
[01:24:47.858 --> 01:24:55.880]  So gun bills and restricting access to firearms and infringing on the Second Amendment is not going to help.
[01:24:56.541 --> 01:24:57.881]  And this is from the Texas Tribune.
[01:24:58.681 --> 01:25:01.662]  There's never, ever, ever enough in rural Texas.
[01:25:01.902 --> 01:25:13.886]  Millions of people in rural Texas who are vulnerable to higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide than their urban counterparts have only limited access to patchwork mental health services.
[01:25:17.170 --> 01:25:24.372]  Story, headline, Uvalde was a mental health desert before a school shooting prompted Texas to respond with resources.
[01:25:25.112 --> 01:25:35.294]  After the May 24th school shooting, mental health help is now pouring into Uvalde, where a fourth of residents are uninsured and counseling options are few and far between.
[01:25:35.374 --> 01:25:36.675]  What is going on?
[01:25:36.755 --> 01:25:38.575]  Why do we have a mental health crisis?
[01:25:39.035 --> 01:25:40.175]  And why in children?
[01:25:43.096 --> 01:25:52.220]   You know, I could sit here and play the political game of left and right and blame Blame games, which we'll do when it's appropriate and accurate.
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:57.665]  But this isn't a political partisan thing to me.
[01:25:58.566 --> 01:26:00.508]  This is just a nation problem thing.
[01:26:01.129 --> 01:26:03.952]  I don't even know what the source of this problem would be.
[01:26:04.012 --> 01:26:06.375]  I mean, I think there's sources all over the place, quite frankly.
[01:26:07.476 --> 01:26:23.916]   I think the most accurate description Would not to be, uh, to find the source of the problem, but just to say, this is a sign of a collapsing nation, this is the sign of a collapsing civilization, when children are anxious, depressed, whatever, and they need mental help all day?
[01:26:24.436 --> 01:26:27.777]  They need a psychiatrist, they need a therapist, they need drugs?
[01:26:29.357 --> 01:26:29.957]  What is that?
[01:26:30.938 --> 01:26:37.459]  How, what, that's a new phenomenon, that's not, that's not normal, that's not traditional, that's never been seen before.
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:39.120]  That, this is a new thing.
[01:26:40.632 --> 01:26:42.013]  I don't think drugs are the answer.
[01:26:42.853 --> 01:26:44.514]  I don't think psychiatrists are the answer.
[01:26:44.954 --> 01:26:46.975]  I think getting back to life is the answer.
[01:26:48.996 --> 01:26:50.796]  Now maybe there's a problem with these school systems.
[01:26:51.197 --> 01:26:54.118]  Public school systems built and treated like prisons.
[01:26:56.359 --> 01:27:00.041]  Maybe there's something wrong with the seven or eight hour school day.
[01:27:00.781 --> 01:27:03.182]  I mean, this should not be happening.
[01:27:04.363 --> 01:27:06.784]  Maybe it's the violent video games, the violent movies.
[01:27:07.004 --> 01:27:15.706]  I'm not sitting here, that's what I'm saying, I'm not sitting here pointing fingers saying all the answers, but I mean, this is just to sit here and say, look at how sick our kids are, look at how much mental health problems we have.
[01:27:16.286 --> 01:27:19.607]  Now the one thing here could be it's just extremely exaggerated.
[01:27:21.047 --> 01:27:33.552]   I do think there may be an aspect of that, just looking for anything and everything to publish a story about the Texas shooting, so it could drastically Over-exaggerate the problem, but there's no doubt there is a problem.
[01:27:33.852 --> 01:27:41.295]  I forget the story, but it was like, 50% of college-age males are on some form of antidepressants or SSRI drugs?
[01:27:41.315 --> 01:27:45.776]  I mean, that is just bombing our civilization with drug abuse.
[01:27:46.656 --> 01:27:48.557]  But, oh, it's a prescription, so it's good for you.
[01:27:48.897 --> 01:27:49.297]  Uh, no.
[01:27:50.277 --> 01:27:52.098]  No, it's probably worse for you, actually.
[01:27:54.434 --> 01:27:55.215]  So, but what's the answer?
[01:27:55.275 --> 01:27:56.235]  Oh, we just need more.
[01:27:56.275 --> 01:27:57.536]  We need more this, more that.
[01:27:57.836 --> 01:28:02.399]  More gun control, more health advocates, more mental health advocates, more people in school.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:08.603]  It's like we just keep going farther and farther away from normal human life.
[01:28:10.084 --> 01:28:12.965]  The more we try to respond to stuff like this, and it just makes it worse.
[01:28:13.466 --> 01:28:15.927]  Lawmakers introduce bill to tax assault weapons 1,000%.
[01:28:16.227 --> 01:28:19.109]  Oh, so only the rich can have guns.
[01:28:19.469 --> 01:28:19.970]  I see.
[01:28:20.590 --> 01:28:21.631]  That's what we want.
[01:28:22.924 --> 01:28:25.726]  Lawmaker introduces bill, it's a Democrat bill, of course, Don Beyer.
[01:28:26.246 --> 01:28:28.388]  To tax assault weapons a thousand percent.
[01:28:28.468 --> 01:28:30.970]  That way only rich people can have guns.
[01:28:32.631 --> 01:28:34.753]  That's what the Democrat elitists are all about.
[01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:36.454]  Only rich people having guns.
[01:28:36.494 --> 01:28:37.394]  So that'll be them.
[01:28:37.735 --> 01:28:41.657]  They'll have guns, they'll have armed security, but they'll defund the place and disarm you.
[01:28:42.138 --> 01:28:43.239]  They just love you so much.
[01:28:43.699 --> 01:28:47.582]  These 27 Democrats voted against extra security for Supreme Court justices.
[01:28:47.602 --> 01:28:48.983]  This is one of the weirder things to me.
[01:28:50.293 --> 01:28:52.835]  Why are the Supreme Court justices' lives in danger?
[01:28:52.955 --> 01:28:56.397]  Because of Democrats and Democrat propaganda and Democrat hatred.
[01:28:57.078 --> 01:29:02.581]  And then Democrats, some of them vote to protect the Supreme Court justices that they put in harm.
[01:29:03.022 --> 01:29:09.246]  And then others don't vote to protect the Supreme Court justices that Democrats put in harm's way.
[01:29:09.986 --> 01:29:12.548]  And then the ones that do vote, they virtue signal like, look at how great I am.
[01:29:13.048 --> 01:29:13.969]  I voted to protect them.
[01:29:14.269 --> 01:29:15.650]  No, you're the one that put them in danger.
[01:29:15.670 --> 01:29:17.391]  All right, we're in the third hour now.
[01:29:17.591 --> 01:29:19.893]  I plan on opening up the phone lines here shortly.
[01:29:21.431 --> 01:29:23.725]  And then Paul Joseph Watson hosting the fourth hour.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:33.143]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have put together, we're very proud of this, an immune support formula package at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:29:33.943 --> 01:29:36.244]  It's the ultimate immune support pack.
[01:29:36.925 --> 01:29:40.546]  It includes Survival Shield X2, that's the nascent iodine.
[01:29:40.806 --> 01:29:45.208]  Most people are deficient in iodine, so we take care of that with Survival Shield X2.
[01:29:45.648 --> 01:29:47.488]  Vitamin D3 gummies with calcium.
[01:29:47.669 --> 01:29:50.510]  Again, most people are deficient in vitamin D.
[01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:52.850]  Plus we add the calcium in there.
[01:29:52.950 --> 01:29:54.311]  Kids love these gummies, by the way.
[01:29:54.331 --> 01:29:54.971]  They taste great.
[01:29:55.671 --> 01:29:57.431]  Vitamin D3 gummies with calcium in there.
[01:29:57.671 --> 01:29:58.951]  The immune support formula.
[01:29:58.991 --> 01:30:03.312]  We just put together an all-natural, organic ingredient immune support formula.
[01:30:03.392 --> 01:30:07.073]  Things that are derived from nature that are known to help your immune system.
[01:30:07.093 --> 01:30:08.253]  We put it in a liquid tincture.
[01:30:08.293 --> 01:30:09.614]  It's the immune support formula.
[01:30:09.954 --> 01:30:13.594]  And then the whole food multivitamin in there as well.
[01:30:14.135 --> 01:30:20.256]  Just all kinds of vitamins and nutrients in the whole food multivitamin to get your daily needs met.
[01:30:20.876 --> 01:30:24.046]   In fact, I've got it right here in front of me.
[01:30:24.907 --> 01:30:32.373]  It's got 83% the daily value of vitamin A. It's got 100% daily value of vitamin D3.
[01:30:32.393 --> 01:30:36.316]  It's got 100% daily value of vitamin K1.
[01:30:36.456 --> 01:30:37.977]  I'm just going through some of these that have the 100% now.
[01:30:37.997 --> 01:30:38.257]  Vitamin B12, 100%.
[01:30:38.377 --> 01:30:39.178]  Riboflavin, 100%.
[01:30:39.018 --> 01:30:43.157]   vitamin b twelve one hundred percent rival flavin one hundred percent
[01:30:43.157 --> 01:30:47.978]   by a man one hundred percent magnesium one hundred percent method
[01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:49.931]  It's all in there, folks.
[01:30:49.951 --> 01:30:51.851]  Zinc, 100% of the daily value.
[01:30:52.331 --> 01:30:54.151]  That's why the Whole Food Multivitamin is so great.
[01:30:54.612 --> 01:30:55.752]  It's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:30:55.772 --> 01:31:01.473]  But that pack, all of those supplements together, that pack is the ultimate immune support pack.

[01:31:13.975 --> 01:31:14.415]  All right.
[01:31:17.475 --> 01:31:19.916]  This is a pretty wild video that we have here.
[01:31:20.897 --> 01:31:24.659]  And you know the trend is to stop Asian hate, right?
[01:31:25.339 --> 01:31:34.084]  Everybody knows about the stop Asian hate trend that we've been seeing, except all of a sudden it went away because it wasn't being done by white people.
[01:31:35.126 --> 01:31:41.447]  And so all of a sudden the liberals and the media didn't care about stopping Asian hate anymore when they couldn't blame it on white people.
[01:31:42.287 --> 01:31:47.668]  But here's a nice fresh example of some of the Asian hate from a non-whitey.
[01:31:48.468 --> 01:31:50.929]  And boy oh boy is this one fun here.
[01:31:51.329 --> 01:31:52.489]  She's not so bright.
[01:31:53.569 --> 01:31:55.209]  She hates Asians.
[01:31:55.870 --> 01:31:57.450]  And here she is.
[01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:03.951]  But we'll see if this one makes the stop Asian hate brigade trend in clip six.
[01:32:06.104 --> 01:32:08.707]  Hey, Orlando, Florida, I'd like you to meet someone.
[01:32:09.427 --> 01:32:11.149]  You're a Chinese bitch, not me.
[01:32:11.850 --> 01:32:12.911]  Okay, I got that on camera.
[01:32:13.171 --> 01:32:14.632]  I got that camera calling me back.
[01:32:14.672 --> 01:32:15.553]  You're a Chinese bitch.
[01:32:15.613 --> 01:32:16.134]  Okay, thank you.
[01:32:16.434 --> 01:32:17.715]  You want me to sound it for you?
[01:32:17.735 --> 01:32:19.036]  You're a Chinese bitch.
[01:32:19.156 --> 01:32:20.097]  Okay, thank you.
[01:32:20.237 --> 01:32:20.938]  Okay?
[01:32:21.178 --> 01:32:22.460]  Okay, I have her on camera saying that.
[01:32:22.500 --> 01:32:23.481]  Who gives a fuck, bitch?
[01:32:23.541 --> 01:32:24.301]  Call the police.
[01:32:24.321 --> 01:32:25.242]  What they gonna do?
[01:32:25.402 --> 01:32:27.745]  I said in front of them, you're a Chinese bitch.
[01:32:27.905 --> 01:32:28.345]  Now what?
[01:32:29.405 --> 01:32:31.405]  We can trust have you.
[01:32:31.405 --> 01:32:33.405]  Turn, turn.
[01:32:33.405 --> 01:32:35.405]  Blimey, blimey, blimey.
[01:32:35.405 --> 01:32:37.405]  Okay, you're going on Facebook.
[01:32:37.405 --> 01:32:39.405]   It is dumb to spew racial hate at someone who is recording you with their phone.
[01:32:39.405 --> 01:32:41.005]  recording you with their phone.
[01:32:41.022 --> 01:32:42.063]  But you know what's even dumber?
[01:32:42.243 --> 01:32:46.882]   to do that to someone as you're paying for your food and then wait around for the person you just
[01:32:46.882 --> 01:32:51.443]   insulted to make and give you your food because that's what she did.
[01:32:51.443 --> 01:33:04.643]  And you know what's even dumber than that?
[01:33:04.898 --> 01:33:11.806]  Paying for your food with a debit card that not only has your name on it, it also has the name of your business.
[01:33:13.439 --> 01:33:19.942]  So, not the best move, Liz Knighton, owner of Body Beauty Bar in Orlando.
[01:33:20.342 --> 01:33:25.765]  She also allegedly went home and then left two nasty reviews for the business, making up stories that didn't happen.
[01:33:26.065 --> 01:33:32.047]  So apparently she's fine with people going to say a business and writing bad reviews that never took place.
[01:33:32.347 --> 01:33:34.348]  Although I can't imagine what further damage that could do.
[01:33:34.468 --> 01:33:50.635]   Her current Better Business Bureau rating is an F, including several very legitimate sounding complaints that were reported long before this video was made, including one That's not great, Liz, but I can finish this on a positive note.
[01:33:52.456 --> 01:34:01.199]  And it looks like they're about to open an additional location in Daytona Beach.
[01:34:01.499 --> 01:34:05.101]  So I think the next time I'm in Orlando, I'm gonna have to stop by and try them for myself.
[01:34:05.681 --> 01:34:07.822]  And I hope to not see you there, Liz.
[01:34:09.701 --> 01:34:12.443]  You think that's gonna make the ol' stop Asian hate?
[01:34:14.064 --> 01:34:14.485]  Theater?
[01:34:15.846 --> 01:34:16.126]  No.
[01:34:16.386 --> 01:34:17.247]  Somehow I doubt it.
[01:34:19.308 --> 01:34:26.834]  Also, I'd be willing to make quite a significant bet that that lady is a Democrat.
[01:34:27.634 --> 01:34:27.814]  Yeah.
[01:34:28.615 --> 01:34:33.319]  I have a feeling I know what she would say if I asked her how she felt about Donald Trump.
[01:34:34.039 --> 01:34:34.339]  Yeah.
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:36.181]  I think it's pretty obvious, isn't it?
[01:34:37.177 --> 01:34:40.560]  Oh, liberals, they're everywhere, and their hatred just overwhelms them.
[01:34:42.562 --> 01:34:43.743]  Really just incredible stuff.
[01:34:44.243 --> 01:34:45.544]  Sad stuff, but there it is.
[01:34:47.166 --> 01:34:49.408]  Let me do this right now as well.
[01:34:49.848 --> 01:34:55.173]  Incredible footage of a police officer in Naperville.
[01:34:55.213 --> 01:34:56.634]  This is outside of Chicago.
[01:34:58.676 --> 01:35:08.026]   And guys, I'll pitch to the video here, but So this police officer is dealing with a traffic stop.
[01:35:08.746 --> 01:35:19.694]  The guy is delaying and he's dealing with him for now more than 10 minutes and he obviously called up a friend of his to I guess come assault the officer and so here it is.
[01:35:20.655 --> 01:35:22.236]  Guy pulls up in a vehicle.
[01:35:22.316 --> 01:35:24.217]  Police, okay, what's going on?
[01:35:25.438 --> 01:35:26.339]  Guys, give me the audio here.
[01:35:26.359 --> 01:35:28.560]  Does this one have audio or I guess the doc cam doesn't have audio.
[01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.281]  We'll go to body cam.
[01:35:29.501 --> 01:35:30.642]  So he runs out, oh there it is.
[01:35:32.643 --> 01:35:35.998]   So he runs out to try to Yeah, here's the body cam.
[01:35:36.278 --> 01:35:36.699]  Watch this.
[01:35:37.259 --> 01:35:44.201]  At this point at the traffic stop, the officer's been on the scene with the driver for more than 11 minutes when a guy pulls up to try to hatchet him.
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:55.240]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:36:05.240]  [INAUDIBLE]
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:08.240]  (Groaning)
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:10.240]  Basically, I've just been attacked.
[01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:10.949]  I just... Shots fired!
[01:36:11.009 --> 01:36:11.710]  Shots fired!
[01:36:13.691 --> 01:36:15.012]  Alright, so, uh, there you go.
[01:36:15.032 --> 01:36:15.632]  There you see it.
[01:36:16.793 --> 01:36:21.636]  And, um, I mean, obviously, folks, the problem here is the hatchet.
[01:36:22.477 --> 01:36:23.978]  I mean, that hatchet was out of control.
[01:36:24.938 --> 01:36:30.542]  I mean, that poor, innocent man was taken advantage of by a radical hatchet.
[01:36:32.944 --> 01:36:33.844]  He comes out of the car.
[01:36:33.884 --> 01:36:34.825]  He's got his hatchet.
[01:36:35.882 --> 01:36:38.083]  And, uh, he tries to attack the police officer with it.
[01:36:39.043 --> 01:36:43.024]  And, uh, he doesn't make it more than three steps before the officer puts him down.
[01:36:43.784 --> 01:36:45.065]  Down goes the hatchet man.
[01:36:45.085 --> 01:36:48.226]  Oh, I'm sure it's the hatchets to blame.
[01:36:48.486 --> 01:36:49.766]  We should probably ban hatchets.
[01:36:51.867 --> 01:36:53.947]  And, uh, disarm police and ban hatchets.
[01:36:54.848 --> 01:36:55.968]  That's the answer here.
[01:36:56.688 --> 01:36:58.069]  Uh, pretty incredible stuff there, isn't it?
[01:36:58.989 --> 01:37:00.229]  Pretty amazing stuff.
[01:37:00.269 --> 01:37:02.630]  Police officers are the ones that get attacked and...
[01:37:05.083 --> 01:37:06.104]  Demonized and everything.
[01:37:06.144 --> 01:37:08.185]  And look, I've had plenty of problems with cops over the years.
[01:37:08.225 --> 01:37:09.886]  I still have plenty of problems with bad cops.
[01:37:10.306 --> 01:37:14.928]  I have more of a problem, I think, with the law than I do individual police officers.
[01:37:16.289 --> 01:37:19.270]  But that's what police deal with all the time.
[01:37:20.511 --> 01:37:27.655]  And they just get hate, sadly, when they put those criminals down.
[01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.929]  That's what they do.
[01:37:29.949 --> 01:37:31.990]  Alright, I'm going to give out the phone number now.
[01:37:32.050 --> 01:37:33.350]  We'll start aggregating calls.
[01:37:33.930 --> 01:37:37.411]  I'll probably take calls in the last two segments that I'm with you here today.
[01:37:37.431 --> 01:37:39.332]  I'm going to do a news blitz in the next segment.
[01:37:39.972 --> 01:37:43.092]  But anything I've covered so far today is fair game.
[01:37:43.112 --> 01:37:43.193]  877-789-2539.
[01:37:43.213 --> 01:37:43.513]  877-789-2539.
[01:37:43.533 --> 01:37:45.493]  Anything we've covered so far today is fair game.
[01:37:45.613 --> 01:37:47.314]  I'm going to come back in the next segment.
[01:37:47.134 --> 01:37:53.654]   777-789-2539. Anything we've covered so far today is fair game. I'm gonna come back in the next segment.
[01:37:53.654 --> 01:37:56.653]   I'm gonna do a news blitz, try to get the rest of this news off my desk, and
[01:37:56.653 --> 01:38:01.274]   then we will take phone calls until Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[01:38:01.274 --> 01:38:11.274]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:10.604]  But of course, remember folks, InfoWarsStore.com is how everything we do here is possible, including the great crew.
[01:38:11.544 --> 01:38:13.405]  Did you hear about this one though, as we go to break?
[01:38:13.605 --> 01:38:14.486]  DC Star...
[01:38:15.461 --> 01:38:17.381]  Kidnaps teenager and vanishes.
[01:38:17.441 --> 01:38:18.942]  Authorities continue searching.
[01:38:18.962 --> 01:38:21.942]  You probably... I've covered this Ezra Miller story before.
[01:38:22.282 --> 01:38:25.803]  You know, they say you can't make it in Hollywood these days without being a liberal or a pedophile.
[01:38:26.083 --> 01:38:28.143]  Lucky for them, most of them are the same.
[01:38:28.623 --> 01:38:30.304]  You can knock both those birds out with each one.
[01:38:30.744 --> 01:38:37.985]  But now this guy, after allegedly abusing these teenage girls, now has kidnapped them and is missing.
[01:38:39.365 --> 01:38:39.745]  Man!
[01:38:40.506 --> 01:38:42.926]  That is some wacky, wild stuff there.
[01:38:44.344 --> 01:38:47.222]  I don't think he'll be playing Flash in the next movie.
[01:38:47.222 --> 01:38:52.663]   Constraints that COVID has played, look we have the Warner Rock, we have COVID which
[01:38:52.663 --> 01:39:01.023]   has really constraints that COVID has played, look we have the Warner Rock, we have COVID
[01:39:01.023 --> 01:39:09.104]   which has really constraints that COVID has played, look we have the Warner Rock, we have
[01:39:09.505 --> 01:39:15.224]   Another geriatric, mush-mouthed, corrupt criminal Democrat, Nancy Pelosi.
[01:39:15.224 --> 01:39:16.423]  She can't even talk right.
[01:39:16.423 --> 01:39:21.844]   By the way, she's up there wearing a Ukrainian badge, wearing a Ukrainian bracelet, wearing
[01:39:21.844 --> 01:39:26.265]  Ukraine colors, and then she says the war in Iraq.
[01:39:26.265 --> 01:39:28.305]  She's gone.
[01:39:28.305 --> 01:39:33.625]   Why are we still dealing with these geriatric, old criminal fools like Nancy Pelosi and Joe
[01:39:33.625 --> 01:39:34.184]  Biden?
[01:39:34.184 --> 01:39:36.483]   *awkward silence* Ugh!
[01:39:37.964 --> 01:39:38.484]  Oh God!
[01:39:39.025 --> 01:39:55.337]  I can, you know, I just, the day that we don't have to deal with these criminals anymore, the day this country rids itself of the Democrat Party, folks, we are going to see so much prosperity, such a boom of life and love and happiness and rejuvenation of the American way of life and just everything that comes with it.
[01:39:55.377 --> 01:39:56.297]  It's going to be awesome, man.
[01:39:56.317 --> 01:39:56.878]  We're going to do it.
[01:39:57.697 --> 01:39:59.718]  It's not going to be easy.
[01:39:59.798 --> 01:40:00.739]  It's going to be difficult.
[01:40:00.779 --> 01:40:03.260]  There's going to be a lot of crossroads and a lot of obstacles.
[01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:04.300]  But we're going to do it.
[01:40:04.781 --> 01:40:05.521]  I really believe so.
[01:40:05.581 --> 01:40:06.822]  I hope I'm alive to witness it.
[01:40:08.082 --> 01:40:09.583]  We're going to defeat the evil globalists.
[01:40:09.803 --> 01:40:11.424]  We're going to defeat the corporate world government.
[01:40:12.605 --> 01:40:17.127]  And we're going to rid ourselves of the biggest scourge in the history of this nation, the Democrat Party.
[01:40:17.667 --> 01:40:24.311]  And we're going to start to see life and love and liberty and the pursuit of happiness and prosperity combined like we have never seen in this country.
[01:40:25.290 --> 01:40:26.551]  And it's gonna be incredible.
[01:40:26.911 --> 01:40:28.532]  But we gotta get those maggots.
[01:40:29.413 --> 01:40:30.833]  We have to get these maggots.
[01:40:32.354 --> 01:40:33.935]  Like Nancy Pelosi out of our way.
[01:40:35.196 --> 01:40:41.360]  Who wears the Ukrainian colors and bracelet and lapel pin and then says it's the war in Iraq.
[01:40:45.521 --> 01:40:48.422]  All right, let's do a News Blitz here before we start to take phone calls.
[01:40:48.862 --> 01:40:53.944]  Joe Biden shatters all records of migrants entering the United States at open southern border.
[01:40:53.964 --> 01:40:58.485]  Yeah, it's three million a year now pouring in and you're paying for all of it.
[01:40:58.885 --> 01:40:59.546]  Isn't that nice?
[01:41:00.146 --> 01:41:06.868]  Don't you love having a wide open border and getting replaced by people that come here for free the illegal way?
[01:41:07.068 --> 01:41:07.228]  Yeah.
[01:41:07.788 --> 01:41:11.249]  Mail-in ballots found scattered along local San Diego freeway.
[01:41:11.269 --> 01:41:12.690]  Oh, I'm sure nothing to find there.
[01:41:14.352 --> 01:41:18.273]  A California man found several mail-in ballots on the freeway near San Diego last week.
[01:41:19.734 --> 01:41:21.614]  Eh, just some boxes of mail-in ballots.
[01:41:21.634 --> 01:41:26.236]  I don't know, if somebody called the local Democrat Party, they may be missing some ballots.
[01:41:26.856 --> 01:41:28.357]  Hey, Democrats, we found your ballots.
[01:41:28.777 --> 01:41:29.477]  In case you're missing them.
[01:41:30.697 --> 01:41:31.698]  You know.
[01:41:32.358 --> 01:41:38.600]  Former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos says, I don't think the Department of Education should exist.
[01:41:40.080 --> 01:41:40.360]  Wow.
[01:41:41.001 --> 01:41:41.801]  Bow, Queen.
[01:41:43.456 --> 01:41:46.697]  I love somebody that works for the government that has disdain for the government.
[01:41:46.957 --> 01:41:49.798]  That's the kind of government worker I like.
[01:41:49.938 --> 01:41:53.699]  One that has distrust and disdain even for the very government it works for.
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:55.480]  Like Betsy DeVos.
[01:41:57.421 --> 01:41:58.481]  Too true, Betsy.
[01:41:58.541 --> 01:42:00.922]  The Department of Education shouldn't exist.
[01:42:01.162 --> 01:42:01.822]  I agree.
[01:42:02.722 --> 01:42:06.944]  I'd start to shut this government down quicker than you could even imagine.
[01:42:08.783 --> 01:42:11.584]  Oh boy, the left is really mad at Elon Musk.
[01:42:11.604 --> 01:42:13.125]  He voted for Mayra Flores.
[01:42:13.165 --> 01:42:14.825]  He wants Ron DeSantis to run.
[01:42:15.705 --> 01:42:19.107]  So the left is just all up in a tizzy because they don't like him.
[01:42:19.487 --> 01:42:22.048]  Here's Jamal Bowman, a Democrat from New York.
[01:42:22.088 --> 01:42:23.108]  He's a real piece of trash.
[01:42:23.748 --> 01:42:25.169]  Elon Musk is not a leader.
[01:42:25.969 --> 01:42:36.793]  He's just another Republican billionaire who supports white supremacy and authoritarianism because he doesn't want his workers to unionize or to pay his fair share in taxes.
[01:42:38.192 --> 01:42:38.972]  Oh, and there it is.
[01:42:39.032 --> 01:42:40.833]  Here come the tropes against Elon Musk.
[01:42:43.093 --> 01:42:45.854]  The GOP just tried to end democracy and now he's supporting them?
[01:42:45.894 --> 01:42:47.754]  The GOP tried to end democracy?
[01:42:48.014 --> 01:42:50.615]  The Democrats are the ones that visit, that cheat all day.
[01:42:51.175 --> 01:42:51.855]  We all know that.
[01:42:51.875 --> 01:42:52.935]  They don't even want you to have voter ID.
[01:42:52.975 --> 01:42:53.875]  Why do you think that is?
[01:42:54.235 --> 01:42:56.356]  They have illegal immigrants coming here and voting for them.
[01:42:56.416 --> 01:42:57.316]  Why do you think that is?
[01:42:57.636 --> 01:42:59.476]  They don't want an audit of the 2020 election.
[01:42:59.516 --> 01:43:00.617]  Why do you think that is?
[01:43:01.577 --> 01:43:02.297]  Should I go on?
[01:43:03.973 --> 01:43:06.514]  Jamal Bowman, what an absolute scum human.
[01:43:07.254 --> 01:43:10.016]  They're mad at Elon Musk because they can't control him.
[01:43:10.976 --> 01:43:12.497]  That's what it really comes down to.
[01:43:12.637 --> 01:43:17.539]  They want to control the billionaire class, like the Bill Gates and the Jeff Bezoses of the world.
[01:43:18.659 --> 01:43:21.600]  And when they can't control Elon Musk, that makes them mad.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:23.681]  Democrats like to control your life.
[01:43:24.101 --> 01:43:25.202]  They like to control you.
[01:43:25.622 --> 01:43:27.983]  And if they can't, they get mad.
[01:43:29.364 --> 01:43:32.059]   By the way, Guys, see if you can find this.
[01:43:32.099 --> 01:43:33.060]  I'm sorry, I meant to print it.
[01:43:33.180 --> 01:43:34.701]  Elon Musk was talking about this the other day.
[01:43:35.121 --> 01:43:41.886]  There's all of these government incentive programs to get people to buy electric vehicles.
[01:43:43.287 --> 01:43:46.710]  And so you can go out, in fact, it's such a crime actually what Obama did.
[01:43:47.799 --> 01:43:51.541]  If you go out and buy a car, you have to pay a gas guzzler tax.
[01:43:51.561 --> 01:43:53.301]  I think it's like five grand or something.
[01:43:53.762 --> 01:43:55.302]  Obama put that tax on the books.
[01:43:55.362 --> 01:43:57.763]  You buy a combustion engine, you're paying a tax for it.
[01:43:57.883 --> 01:43:59.144]  It's called the gas guzzler tax.
[01:43:59.364 --> 01:44:00.344]  Total criminal activity.
[01:44:01.065 --> 01:44:01.685]  Thanks, Barack.
[01:44:03.326 --> 01:44:13.270]  But they also did an incentive where they give you like a thousand or two thousand or five thousand cash back if you buy an electric vehicle.
[01:44:14.470 --> 01:44:15.371]  But here's the thing.
[01:44:16.598 --> 01:44:18.779]  They didn't give that to Tesla!
[01:44:20.341 --> 01:44:27.966]  All the other motor companies got that advantage, that cash back incentive to buy an electric vehicle, except Tesla!
[01:44:30.247 --> 01:44:32.068]  Why is that, I wonder?
[01:44:33.850 --> 01:44:36.772]  They really don't like Elon Musk, which just makes me like him all the more.
[01:44:37.252 --> 01:44:42.896]  FAA requires SpaceX to make environmental adjustments to move forward with its Starship program in Texas.
[01:44:42.956 --> 01:44:44.757]  Yeah, government getting an Elon Musk's away again.
[01:44:45.799 --> 01:44:49.902]  Government always getting in your way, always wanting to run your life and control you.
[01:44:50.042 --> 01:44:51.763]  I'm sick of government, quite personally.
[01:44:53.224 --> 01:44:56.346]  Democrats love government because it's a tool of control.
[01:44:57.066 --> 01:44:59.008]  It's a source of power for them.
[01:44:59.588 --> 01:45:01.910]  And their lust for control and power in your life.
[01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:04.511]  Here's a perplexing one.
[01:45:05.512 --> 01:45:12.417]  Murder-suicide, murder-suicides by pilots are vexing airlines as deaths mount.
[01:45:13.699 --> 01:45:20.002]  And this is really in the aftermath of a story in China, and it's funny because I remember seeing this and thinking it had to be intentional.
[01:45:21.082 --> 01:45:31.647]  And they said it was a mistake, but then they admitted, no, it was a murder-suicide, where you have these airline pilots literally nose-diving into the ocean and into the mountains, and it's like, what?
[01:45:34.328 --> 01:45:37.570]  So this is just a perplexing one here, folks.
[01:45:39.835 --> 01:45:43.738]  Murder suicides by pilots vexing airlines as deaths mount.
[01:45:43.758 --> 01:45:45.579]  Now, I know what some of you are probably thinking.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:49.903]  I don't know, maybe it is a vaccine thing, but I don't necessarily see that here for sure.
[01:45:51.284 --> 01:45:51.844]  That's a new one.
[01:45:51.864 --> 01:45:52.404]  That's interesting.
[01:45:52.805 --> 01:45:56.027]  Fortunes of crypto billionaires are melting with Bitcoin crash.
[01:45:56.087 --> 01:45:58.429]  Everything's crashing in the Biden economy.
[01:45:59.927 --> 01:46:05.490]  And of course all those people that told you to invest in Bitcoin, it's the be-all end-all, it'll solve every problem on the planet.
[01:46:06.031 --> 01:46:12.014]  And then you lost your money and they made a lot of money with corporate crypto sponsorships, so they didn't mind.
[01:46:12.955 --> 01:46:16.076]  But you lost all your money, they didn't tell you there was a risk involved.
[01:46:16.977 --> 01:46:19.178]  But yeah, it's just everything's collapsing under Biden.
[01:46:20.399 --> 01:46:21.219]  Here's an interesting one.
[01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:28.764]  Obama to install 2,500-gallon commercial-grade propane tank for Martha's Vineyard estate.
[01:46:29.758 --> 01:46:41.226]  So Obama, who says that sea levels are going to kill us all, and then buys multiple beachfront mansions, is he preparing for a apocalypse?
[01:46:41.506 --> 01:46:44.428]  2500 gallon propane tank for Obama?
[01:46:44.488 --> 01:46:45.708]  What is he preparing for?
[01:46:45.748 --> 01:46:46.549]  The apocalypse?
[01:46:47.570 --> 01:46:50.672]  That is a pretty, pretty odd one right there.
[01:46:51.392 --> 01:46:57.116]  Savage monster accused of decapitating pregnant ex-girlfriend and throwing head in a dumpster.
[01:46:58.157 --> 01:46:58.457]  Wow.
[01:46:59.676 --> 01:47:02.759]  Wow, must be some of that mighty white supremacy.
[01:47:02.899 --> 01:47:04.180]  No, exact opposite, actually.
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:10.645]  So you're not going to hear about a white girl being decapitated and head in a dumpster from a non-white supremacist.
[01:47:11.406 --> 01:47:14.148]  Wild brawl breaks out at DC Half Smoke Restaurant.
[01:47:14.308 --> 01:47:15.189]  No arrests made.
[01:47:15.209 --> 01:47:16.410]  You should have seen the video, it's crazy.
[01:47:16.450 --> 01:47:18.191]  But no arrests made because it's culture.
[01:47:18.411 --> 01:47:19.753]  See, it's their culture, they say.
[01:47:21.494 --> 01:47:22.295]  Amazing stuff, isn't it?
[01:47:22.755 --> 01:47:23.656]  Your calls, other side.
[01:47:24.915 --> 01:47:27.237]  Alright, I apologize to callers on the line.
[01:47:27.257 --> 01:47:31.260]  We're going to have to preempt your calls here, and so I just want to explain this to the callers on the line.
[01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:33.822]  We're going to be joined by Alex Jones any minute now.
[01:47:34.659 --> 01:47:38.161]  And then in the next segment, Pete Santilli as well with Alex.
[01:47:38.201 --> 01:47:44.466]  So I apologize to callers on the line, but Alex is going to be joining us here any moment now, so I'm not going to be able to take calls.
[01:47:45.006 --> 01:47:49.009]  So instead, I'll just do a news coverage here until we are joined by Alex.
[01:47:50.070 --> 01:47:54.553]  This is a story that is not getting much coverage in the media, but you need to understand something about it.
[01:47:55.350 --> 01:47:57.811]  Because I think it's going to come back to the front pretty soon.
[01:47:58.872 --> 01:48:09.616]  That's the lower food and fuel costs bill, which was proposed more than a month ago by Biden and the Democrats, and I think it's starting to get new life again.
[01:48:12.558 --> 01:48:18.282]  Angie Craig applauds Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act, as it's about to get to the floor to a vote.
[01:48:18.702 --> 01:48:20.184]  Now here's what you need to understand about this.
[01:48:21.485 --> 01:48:31.812]  They want to lower the fuel costs, is really what they're trying to do here, by putting more ethanol out there, which is using corn in fuel.
[01:48:33.193 --> 01:48:39.578]  Folks, this is not going to lower the price of gasoline, and it's going to raise the price of food.
[01:48:40.970 --> 01:48:44.511]  What do you think happens when you're no longer using that corn for food?
[01:48:45.071 --> 01:48:48.212]  Not just for people to eat, but for livestock to eat.
[01:48:49.832 --> 01:48:57.374]  So the Lower Food and Fuel Cost Act is going to not lower the price of gas, and it's going to increase the price of food.
[01:49:00.495 --> 01:49:02.595]  Our leaders are clowns.
[01:49:03.495 --> 01:49:05.776]  Our leaders are clowns.
[01:49:08.237 --> 01:49:09.317]  Oh, it's so frustrating.
[01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:11.271]  It is so frustrating.
[01:49:12.612 --> 01:49:18.616]  Los Angeles Soft on Crime District Attorney George Gascon blamed for the death of two police officers this week.
[01:49:18.756 --> 01:49:22.099]  Yeah, another criminal that Gascon lets out of jail goes out and commits another murder.
[01:49:22.830 --> 01:49:25.732]  It's typical in Democrat cities, they release the criminals from jail.
[01:49:25.972 --> 01:49:32.998]  Oh, but then they tell you about January 6th and they tell you about people that need to be in jail for the rest of their lives and never committed a crime, never heard a fly.
[01:49:33.398 --> 01:49:36.140]  But oh, actual hardened murderers and rapists and criminals?
[01:49:36.300 --> 01:49:39.263]  Eh, Democrats let them out on the street to rape and murder again, no problem.
[01:49:39.523 --> 01:49:40.284]  No problem.
[01:49:41.164 --> 01:49:42.305]  Nothing to see here.
[01:49:42.645 --> 01:49:43.446]  Nothing to see here.
[01:49:44.046 --> 01:49:49.591]  Alright, the left is coming for Lauren Boebert because she tells the truth and that angers Democrats.
[01:49:50.731 --> 01:49:53.253]  Now, so they tried to do a hit piece on her yesterday.
[01:49:54.434 --> 01:49:58.517]  Liberals rushed to spread bogus Lauren Boebert escort and abortion rumors.
[01:49:58.537 --> 01:50:07.184]  They found some pictures of, I guess, a hooker on the internet that apparently bragged about abortions, and they said it was Lauren Boebert.
[01:50:07.204 --> 01:50:07.745]  It wasn't.
[01:50:08.445 --> 01:50:13.509]  She's also looking at lawsuits for defamation in regards to this.
[01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:15.391]  We'll see the luck she has there.
[01:50:15.431 --> 01:50:18.253]  She's not a Democrat, so it's a lot harder to win cases like that.
[01:50:18.353 --> 01:50:20.055]  Only Democrats win those cases, it seems.
[01:50:21.072 --> 01:50:23.433]  But here's what I found funny about this.
[01:50:23.773 --> 01:50:28.654]  This is Will Sumner, shared the Daily Beast story that I just had the headline.
[01:50:29.414 --> 01:50:30.134]  And this is hilarious.
[01:50:30.174 --> 01:50:31.574]  Let's see if you guys catch on.
[01:50:32.054 --> 01:50:33.395]  Let's see if you guys catch on here.
[01:50:33.995 --> 01:50:36.495]  From Will Sumner, sharing the Lauren Boebert story.
[01:50:37.175 --> 01:50:43.157]  I'm sorry, but the viral Lauren Boebert escort and abortion story is obviously fake.
[01:50:44.457 --> 01:50:45.277]  Yes, Will.
[01:50:45.937 --> 01:50:48.978]  Like everything else you liberals believe.
[01:50:50.811 --> 01:50:51.971]  Russian collusion.
[01:50:52.892 --> 01:50:54.112]  Russian propaganda.
[01:50:55.132 --> 01:50:56.933]  Hunter Biden's laptop isn't real.
[01:50:57.873 --> 01:50:58.674]  Should we go on?
[01:50:59.474 --> 01:51:00.454]  Safe and effective.
[01:51:02.335 --> 01:51:03.135]  Should we go on?
[01:51:03.235 --> 01:51:04.295]  Do we need to go on?
[01:51:06.136 --> 01:51:11.198]  I'm sorry, but the Lauren Boebert escort and abortion story is obviously fake, says liberal Will Summer.
[01:51:12.618 --> 01:51:15.439]  Yeah, everything you guys believe is fake.
[01:51:16.778 --> 01:51:19.479]  And not only fake, obviously fake.
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:23.061]  Everything you guys believe is obviously fake.
[01:51:23.561 --> 01:51:26.743]  Not just the Lauren Boebert story, everything.
[01:51:27.923 --> 01:51:28.684]  Every story.
[01:51:29.504 --> 01:51:30.605]  Jussie Smollett.
[01:51:34.947 --> 01:51:38.028]  Everything liberals believe is obviously fake.
[01:51:39.329 --> 01:51:41.410]  You just figured it out one time.
[01:51:41.450 --> 01:51:42.751]  You're one for your whole life.
[01:51:42.791 --> 01:51:45.192]  You figured it out with Lauren Boebert's story there.
[01:51:46.570 --> 01:51:51.252]  Now, I'm not the guy obsessed with race, because I'm not a racist bigot liberal Democrat.
[01:51:51.672 --> 01:51:54.053]  They're the racist bigots in this country.
[01:51:54.293 --> 01:52:01.596]  But I'm pretty sure that Clarence Thomas is the only black Supreme Court Justice for now.
[01:52:01.776 --> 01:52:02.097]  I don't think...
[01:52:03.786 --> 01:52:10.031]  The pedophile supporting judge has officially been put in her place yet.
[01:52:10.451 --> 01:52:12.773]  So as of now, I believe it's Clarence Thomas is the only one.
[01:52:13.153 --> 01:52:16.576]  So why are Democrats trying to remove him from the bench?
[01:52:17.416 --> 01:52:20.499]  MSNBC, the case for impeaching Justice Clarence Thomas.
[01:52:20.739 --> 01:52:22.080]  Now guess what their case is?
[01:52:23.100 --> 01:52:26.582]  Their case is that his wife is a Trump supporter.
[01:52:27.323 --> 01:52:28.303]  That's their case.
[01:52:28.383 --> 01:52:29.344]  They don't like his wife.
[01:52:29.664 --> 01:52:31.365]  They don't like his wife telling it like it is.
[01:52:31.585 --> 01:52:34.407]  They don't like his wife that doesn't trust the 2020 election results.
[01:52:34.587 --> 01:52:37.409]  They don't like his wife that likes Donald Trump.
[01:52:37.449 --> 01:52:40.091]  And so they want to remove Clarence Thomas because they don't like his wife.
[01:52:41.272 --> 01:52:43.073]  You Democrats are sick people.
[01:52:44.349 --> 01:52:46.391]  You all belong in mental institutions.
[01:52:47.031 --> 01:52:51.195]  Maybe we should just send you all to Mars, since you hate this planet so much.
[01:52:51.235 --> 01:52:52.175]  Maybe you'll like it on Mars.
[01:52:52.776 --> 01:52:54.277]  Maybe you can find a way to destroy Mars.
[01:52:54.677 --> 01:52:55.518]  That'd be a challenge.
[01:52:55.738 --> 01:53:01.763]  I'd actually like to see Democrats... I'd challenge Democrats to try to destroy Mars like they've destroyed America.
[01:53:02.484 --> 01:53:03.645]  That's a challenge for them.
[01:53:05.305 --> 01:53:06.605]  That would be an interesting challenge.
[01:53:06.686 --> 01:53:08.566]  Let's see Democrats try to destroy Mars.
[01:53:08.986 --> 01:53:12.488]  But so they want to remove Clarence Thomas from the bench because they don't like his politics.
[01:53:12.508 --> 01:53:13.328]  They don't like his wife.
[01:53:13.708 --> 01:53:15.489]  He's the only black justice on there right now.
[01:53:15.569 --> 01:53:17.829]  So wow, I guess that would mean Democrats are racist.
[01:53:18.250 --> 01:53:19.070]  But we all knew that.
[01:53:19.410 --> 01:53:20.150]  Here's more proof.
[01:53:20.170 --> 01:53:22.451]  This is a Democrat professor at Cal State.
[01:53:23.572 --> 01:53:24.532]  Attention white people!
[01:53:25.795 --> 01:53:28.317]  This is Professor Malina Abdullah, Cal State.
[01:53:28.697 --> 01:53:33.040]  Attention white people, please do not ask if you can come to the cookout.
[01:53:33.541 --> 01:53:35.982]  Juneteenth is freedom day for black folks.
[01:53:36.563 --> 01:53:38.924]  It should be reparation day for white folks.
[01:53:39.745 --> 01:53:41.766]  Ah, spoken like a true hardcore bigot.
[01:53:42.487 --> 01:53:44.528]  She must be a liberal democrat, and she is.
[01:53:44.788 --> 01:53:45.969]  She's also a professor.
[01:53:46.770 --> 01:53:59.423]   Now I'd love to see the logic of individuals who have never been slaves Getting paid by individuals who have never owned slaves for slavery.
[01:54:00.424 --> 01:54:02.285]  That's called liberal logic.
[01:54:02.785 --> 01:54:05.166]  Might also be called a mental disorder, because it is.
[01:54:06.107 --> 01:54:07.827]  But it's even more absurd than that.
[01:54:09.048 --> 01:54:10.749]  Because they'll say, oh, what about your ancestors?
[01:54:10.949 --> 01:54:11.249]  Okay.
[01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:18.793]  So you're going to have people whose ancestors that have never been slaved being paid off by people whose ancestors who have never had slaves.
[01:54:19.073 --> 01:54:20.714]  So as you see, the logic still plays out.
[01:54:20.774 --> 01:54:21.654]  It's still the same logic.
[01:54:21.995 --> 01:54:26.175]   Because When logic can be applied universally, it's logic.
[01:54:27.235 --> 01:54:30.896]  When logic cannot be applied universally, it's propaganda.
[01:54:32.556 --> 01:54:35.356]  That's why liberal logic is so frustrating, because it's not logic.
[01:54:35.697 --> 01:54:36.497]  It's propaganda.
[01:54:37.677 --> 01:54:38.657]  And here's some more of it.
[01:54:39.237 --> 01:54:40.017]  This is hilarious.
[01:54:40.398 --> 01:54:40.878]  Opinion.
[01:54:41.058 --> 01:54:44.418]  It's about damn time we got a celebrity apology like Lizzo.
[01:54:44.478 --> 01:54:50.600]  So Lizzo writes a song about how she likes to fight and shoot people and chop men's penises off.
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:52.220]  Not even kidding you.
[01:54:53.382 --> 01:54:59.588]  She writes a song about how she likes to fight people and chop men's penises off.
[01:55:01.690 --> 01:55:07.995]  But there's a lyric in her song, Girls, that's all about chopping men's penises off and fighting in the club.
[01:55:08.396 --> 01:55:11.198]  But there's a lyric in there, it goes, do you see this?
[01:55:11.579 --> 01:55:13.240]  Beep, I'm a spaz.
[01:55:13.941 --> 01:55:15.823]  I'm about to knock somebody out.
[01:55:18.504 --> 01:55:21.585]  She the only one, here, let me just read some of these lyrics here for you.
[01:55:22.385 --> 01:55:24.745]  I'm a spaz, I'm about to knock somebody out.
[01:55:27.826 --> 01:55:31.767]  We throwin', we throwin' them bows, let's F it up.
[01:55:33.187 --> 01:55:35.088]  That's the type of fight I'm lookin' for.
[01:55:37.388 --> 01:55:40.949]  Let me take these earrings off and hit the boozy ratchet with my friends.
[01:55:42.037 --> 01:55:45.639]  I'm gonna go Lorena Bobbitt on him so he can never beep again.
[01:55:46.279 --> 01:55:47.720]  Now you can't beep again.
[01:55:47.780 --> 01:55:49.440]  And it goes on, the same stuff in the song.
[01:55:49.941 --> 01:55:55.763]  Now, of all those lyrics, which one do you think was offensive, and which one do you think Lizzo was apologizing for?
[01:55:56.804 --> 01:56:02.306]  The part where she talks about chopping men's penises off, or fighting in the club, promoting the violence?
[01:56:02.486 --> 01:56:03.747]  No, it was Spaz.
[01:56:05.187 --> 01:56:08.249]  Spaz, because apparently Spaz is...
[01:56:09.267 --> 01:56:09.888]  Ableist?
[01:56:10.509 --> 01:56:11.670]  I'm not even kidding you.
[01:56:12.150 --> 01:56:19.999]  Lizzo apologizes for ableist lyrics using the word spaz because there's some disorder called spastic something?
[01:56:22.611 --> 01:56:29.397]  And so she used spaz and she apologized because someone sent her a message saying, I have spastic disorder, I'm offended.
[01:56:30.158 --> 01:56:36.584]  But not at her chopping off men's penises or fighting in the club or all of her other disgusting smut that she puts out.
[01:56:37.024 --> 01:56:39.807]  It was the word spaz that did it.
[01:56:41.248 --> 01:56:41.809]  Ah, liberals.
[01:56:43.230 --> 01:56:47.174]  Put them in the mental institutions and watch everything else work itself out.
[01:56:47.938 --> 01:56:49.779]  Lots of big breaking developing news.
[01:56:50.519 --> 01:56:55.680]  You're not going to find it covered anywhere else like right here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:56:56.861 --> 01:57:00.122]  And Alex Jones joins us on the phone now.
[01:57:00.802 --> 01:57:02.682]  I'm not even sure what Alex is breaking right now.
[01:57:02.722 --> 01:57:04.823]  He's about to be joined by Pete Santilli as well.
[01:57:04.883 --> 01:57:09.865]  So, Alex, I'm waiting here on the edge of my seat to know what the big news is.
[01:57:11.165 --> 01:57:17.667]  Well, I was told about this from some of the inside sources for some of the more well-known defendants that have been charged.
[01:57:18.564 --> 01:57:27.987]  The seditious conspiracy situation, and they knew that the committee was swearing people in, acting like it was a real hearing under law, which it is.
[01:57:28.628 --> 01:57:36.610]  And then when they were having witnesses in the room to listen to other witnesses, and when they'd already pre-coached them, that is completely illegal.
[01:57:36.670 --> 01:57:37.931]  That's how you rig a trial.
[01:57:38.691 --> 01:57:45.913]  Anyone, even if they were an axe murderer, would have to be released from jail and charges dropped whenever things like this happen.
[01:57:45.933 --> 01:57:46.334]  This is just 101.
[01:57:47.879 --> 01:57:49.261]  That you do not do this.
[01:57:50.023 --> 01:57:55.191]  And it's the same thing with Democrats doing civil cases and criminal cases all over the United States.
[01:57:56.053 --> 01:57:57.936]  They're doing it in Canada as well.
[01:57:57.976 --> 01:58:00.059]  They have weaponized the judiciary.
[01:58:01.763 --> 01:58:19.554]  I was told about this on Monday and Tuesday because they were clearly just violating the law out in front of the whole world, not just tainting the jury pool, but saying people were convicted, airing edited tapes, falsified evidence, violating the rule of completeness, where if you show a clip, you've got to show it in context or show basically the whole clip or most of the clip.
[01:58:19.935 --> 01:58:20.855]  So it's a two-hour show.
[01:58:20.875 --> 01:58:22.036]  You've got to show 15 minutes of it.
[01:58:22.056 --> 01:58:23.997]  If it's a five-minute clip, you've got to show four minutes of it.
[01:58:24.337 --> 01:58:34.720]   You've got to show at least The majority of it, instead of edited tapes, similar to what Schiff already did three times in the committee, editing emails to say completely false things about Trump and others.
[01:58:35.200 --> 01:58:37.622]  And so we have CNN pieces saying, I'm guilty.
[01:58:38.482 --> 01:58:42.505]  CNN pieces saying that I basically commanded the attack on the Capitol.
[01:58:43.145 --> 01:58:44.146]  We've got that piece coming up.
[01:58:44.947 --> 01:58:45.528]  Next segment.
[01:58:46.148 --> 01:58:52.214]  And so whether Joe Biggs is guilty or not, whether Stuart Rhodes is guilty or not, I don't believe they're guilty of seditious conspiracy.
[01:58:52.234 --> 01:58:53.135]  Do they go in the Capitol?
[01:58:53.735 --> 01:58:56.558]  Would a Democrat maybe get a trip to jail and out in two hours for that?
[01:58:56.578 --> 01:58:56.898]  Yeah.
[01:58:57.378 --> 01:58:59.380]  So maybe jail for two hours and then out in two hours.
[01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:04.205]  If it's a equally applied justice system, certainly not seditious conspiracy.
[01:59:04.225 --> 01:59:08.088]  And they certainly weren't being commanded by me or Trump or anybody else.
[01:59:08.128 --> 01:59:11.211]  That's why I was there trying to stop people going to the Capitol in the same CNN piece.
[01:59:11.847 --> 01:59:15.127]   that they did covering hearings and how I'm a dangerous extremist.
[01:59:15.127 --> 01:59:19.488]   They said that I was there encouraging people to go into the Capitol and they show footage
[01:59:19.488 --> 01:59:23.127]  without audio of me saying, "Don't go in the Capitol.
[01:59:23.127 --> 01:59:24.127]  It'll be a new Kent State.
[01:59:24.127 --> 01:59:25.127]  You'll get shot.
[01:59:25.127 --> 01:59:26.127]  You'll get killed."
[01:59:26.127 --> 01:59:28.807]  So these people are absolute criminals.
[01:59:28.807 --> 01:59:32.287]   The committee, Liz Cheney, all of them are working in concert with a controlled corporate
[01:59:32.287 --> 01:59:36.608]   press and so the big announcement that Pete has here, and I was told this two days ago,
[01:59:36.608 --> 01:59:40.408]   talked to some folks last night, confirmed it, but he talked to the same people, I'll
[01:59:40.408 --> 01:59:44.567]   leave it at that, that are very close to the case and those filings are happening within
[01:59:44.567 --> 01:59:49.448]   hours to say you have to let all of these people that you showed in the committee with
[01:59:49.448 --> 01:59:50.247]  edited tapes.
[01:59:50.668 --> 01:59:55.547]   uh... because you had witnesses in the same room of that are going to be called a criminal case
[01:59:55.547 --> 01:59:58.229]   and you had witnesses in there listening to the other witnesses because you've
[01:59:58.229 --> 02:00:02.828]   done this on purpose to put out your fake narrative to take the whole world's mind
[02:00:02.828 --> 02:00:05.389]   everybody has to be released now and again
[02:00:05.389 --> 02:00:09.828]   better than a hundred guilty men go free than one innocent man go to jail
[02:00:10.249 --> 02:00:12.131]  Well, these people are innocent of what they've claimed.
[02:00:12.792 --> 02:00:18.979]  It's a total fraud, and we are truly in a banana republic, rigged kangaroo court, show trial system, and this is the case.
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:21.923]  The same thing's happening with my Sandy Hook cases that are designed here under the First Amendment.
[02:00:22.464 --> 02:00:23.946]  Democrats are bragging about this on national...
[02:00:24.756 --> 02:00:32.318]  Television, and said, now that we're going to be able to shut Alex Jones down, they think, we'll be able to basically shut everybody else down.
[02:00:32.658 --> 02:00:33.879]  So that's the precedent.
[02:00:34.379 --> 02:00:47.703]  Defaulting me, saying we didn't give them all the stuff they asked for, which is a lie, then saying they're going to have a jury trial on how guilty I am, but that we're not supposed to be able to even talk at these upcoming show trials that begin in late July.
[02:00:47.723 --> 02:00:49.323]  I'm not putting myself in the middle of the story.
[02:00:49.342 --> 02:00:54.101]   I'm explaining this is part of concerted effort, the suits against Trump, the criminal investigations
[02:00:54.101 --> 02:00:59.422]   against Trump, all the things that are being done against the rest of the independent media,
[02:00:59.422 --> 02:01:03.702]   all the different lawsuits being filed against independent media is an attempt to shut everybody
[02:01:04.217 --> 02:01:06.458]  And so we are all having our rights taken right now.
[02:01:07.018 --> 02:01:08.659]  This is a blueprint for all of America.
[02:01:09.260 --> 02:01:19.947]  As Tucker Carlson said just on Monday of this week, he said this is a blueprint to criminalize the political opposition to the Democratic Party in America because the Democratic Party has lost.
[02:01:20.067 --> 02:01:20.747]  Everybody hates them.
[02:01:20.767 --> 02:01:22.288]  There's a political realignment against them.
[02:01:22.669 --> 02:01:24.190]  So this is their last desperate gamble.
[02:01:25.450 --> 02:01:30.573]  They even had to cancel one of the day's hearings because the ratings are so low and no one's buying it and people are getting very angry at him.
[02:01:30.613 --> 02:01:32.613]  So Pete Santilli has got the specifics here.
[02:01:33.114 --> 02:01:33.914]  This is exclusive.
[02:01:34.354 --> 02:01:44.739]  Coming down today, multiple defendants, multiple group filings demanding that they be released because the entire system of due process has been violated in royal flush spades.
[02:01:45.059 --> 02:01:45.660]  Pete Santilli.
[02:01:47.581 --> 02:01:48.281]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:01:48.801 --> 02:01:49.221]  That's right.
[02:01:49.241 --> 02:01:49.762]  It is.
[02:01:50.042 --> 02:01:51.262]  This is exclusive.
[02:01:51.382 --> 02:01:52.323]  I've gotten word now.
[02:01:53.484 --> 02:01:55.225]  It's imminent within hours.
[02:01:55.285 --> 02:02:00.108]  There will be a filing on behalf of all of the January 6th defendants.
[02:02:00.188 --> 02:02:05.852]  I'm sure all of them will join in, but a group is going to be doing a filing en masse.
[02:02:05.912 --> 02:02:10.695]  And let me just tell you how egregious these violations are.
[02:02:10.715 --> 02:02:14.077]  And they're basic fundamental constitutional violations.
[02:02:14.377 --> 02:02:21.461]  If you go read the Sixth Amendment, due process violations, you're supposed to have an adequate defense.
[02:02:22.423 --> 02:02:26.815]  Of course, representation by your attorney, but let me tell you what's happened here.
[02:02:29.148 --> 02:02:41.296]  That Liz Halliburton Cheney is so psychotically zealous towards getting President Trump that she essentially destroyed any possibility of a fair trial.
[02:02:41.416 --> 02:02:44.158]  Let me tell you that there's legal precedence here.
[02:02:45.279 --> 02:02:49.322]  Ali North, I think it was back in 1991, was convicted.
[02:02:49.742 --> 02:02:54.285]  And the way he was convicted was after he was forced to give testimony.
[02:02:55.065 --> 02:03:00.028]  In the Iran-Contra committee hearings, he asserted his Fifth Amendment, right?
[02:03:00.428 --> 02:03:05.270]  They compelled him to give testimony, and then by doing so, they brought him to trial.
[02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:11.894]  Although they offered him immunity, they withheld that, brought him to trial, and he was convicted.
[02:03:12.074 --> 02:03:26.243]   As a result of that conviction, they appealed it, and on appeal, almost identical to the circumstances here at the January 6 hearings, Is that basically the jury pool was tainted another thing Alex Jones?
[02:03:26.723 --> 02:03:33.529]  He's not a defendant, but I'll give you an example of how the jury pool was tainted This Marcus Childress.
[02:03:33.609 --> 02:03:49.461]   He's a an officer of the court an attorney He doctored evidence and lined up a video creating a certain impression that essentially is Irreversible you what they say is you cannot unring a bell So this bell has been rung in two hearings.
[02:03:49.521 --> 02:03:54.304]  I mentioned this to Owen the other day, that there are blessings in disguise here.
[02:03:54.504 --> 02:04:05.689]  A, they're getting caught doctoring evidence, giving just horrifying testimony without any cross-examination or challenging of anything that they're presenting.
[02:04:06.329 --> 02:04:09.711]  This is so egregious that I'm gonna make the call right now.
[02:04:10.251 --> 02:04:23.562]  There is a strong possibility that the defendants that are locked up in the gulag could literally walk, not just walk out the door, but also have all of their charges dropped, a mistrial before the trial even begins.
[02:04:24.162 --> 02:04:25.223]  And Pete, let me just add this.
[02:04:25.843 --> 02:04:33.729]  Anywhere else in America, in Michigan, where the jury said, no, these people are not guilty in the fake Whitmer kidnapping false flag event, you're absolutely right.
[02:04:33.789 --> 02:04:35.671]  Or in Texas, or even in a place like New York.
[02:04:36.463 --> 02:04:39.145]  Or Florida, or even California, but D.C.
[02:04:39.205 --> 02:04:42.807]  has such rigged courts and such rigged systems on record.
[02:04:43.147 --> 02:04:47.330]  You know, we just saw that with the Sussman verdict, where he's caught red-handed, nothing happens because he works for Hillary.
[02:04:48.111 --> 02:04:53.154]  These judges may just go ahead and say, no, we don't care, they can do anything, and that sets the precedent.
[02:04:53.194 --> 02:04:56.256]  So, how does that, what's the process there?
[02:04:56.296 --> 02:05:02.520]   I guess that's appealed to a higher court, because as you said, these are cut-and-dried, basic, one-on-one rules
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:06.159]   uh... of the game and that they were able to do this is just incredible that
[02:05:06.159 --> 02:05:11.088]   question a question b_p_ don't throw it why do you think they're so reckless why are they so
[02:05:11.088 --> 02:05:14.069]   wildlife why are they doctoring evidence in front of everybody why
[02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:17.840]   are they doing this when they fundamentally know it's against the law
[02:05:18.541 --> 02:05:19.401]  I'll make it quick, Pete.
[02:05:20.022 --> 02:05:21.582]  They're psychotic, Alex.
[02:05:21.842 --> 02:05:30.245]  They're psychotic, and I don't think there's anybody that has committed to understand the psychology of liberals right now in media.
[02:05:30.545 --> 02:05:36.566]  I pick a lot of it up from the great Rush Limbaugh and Michael Savage, who's kind of past his prime as well, no disrespect.
[02:05:36.907 --> 02:05:37.747]  They're psychotic.
[02:05:37.767 --> 02:05:44.189]   They have a mental disorder, and everything, the liberal agenda, Trump's everything else in their mind.
[02:05:44.569 --> 02:05:45.569]  You have to understand this.
[02:05:45.709 --> 02:05:50.950]  In everything they do, the liberal propaganda, the liberal agenda trumps everything else.
[02:05:50.990 --> 02:05:53.131]  So, when you see them acting like this, understand.
[02:05:53.351 --> 02:06:01.292]  They're number one, number two, number three, number four, number five, number six, number seven, number eight, number nine, number... All their top 100 priorities are all whatever the liberal agenda is.
[02:06:01.552 --> 02:06:03.453]  So they're acting like psychos because of it.
[02:06:03.513 --> 02:06:03.733]  Pete?
[02:06:05.157 --> 02:06:08.579]  Yeah, and that's why I said psychotic zeal.
[02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:11.741]  Liz Halliburton Cheney, there's a couple of elements here.
[02:06:12.381 --> 02:06:13.722]  They have a window of opportunity.
[02:06:13.962 --> 02:06:17.805]  The DOJ will not prosecute if you get too close to the November elections.
[02:06:18.125 --> 02:06:19.346]  So they were pressed for time.
[02:06:19.826 --> 02:06:23.228]  There was this mad rush to bring the Soviet show trial.
[02:06:23.648 --> 02:06:29.752]  But they're so zealous about going after President Trump that they even, even if they wanted to prosecute President Trump.
[02:06:29.772 --> 02:06:34.515]  Here's the case, United States of America versus Ali North as the appellant.
[02:06:34.995 --> 02:06:37.316]  The circumstances are almost identical.
[02:06:37.396 --> 02:06:42.837]  Because of his testimony to a congressional hearing, he tainted the jury.
[02:06:43.477 --> 02:06:44.397]  It's essentially a mystery.
[02:06:44.417 --> 02:06:46.858]  Didn't that finally go to the Supreme Court?
[02:06:47.798 --> 02:06:51.279]  That was an appeals court in the District of Columbia.
[02:06:51.319 --> 02:06:59.161]  So no judge is going to override well-settled law already ruled upon by an appeals court.
[02:06:59.581 --> 02:07:02.502]  Their career would be destroyed at that point, no matter how corrupt they are.
[02:07:03.345 --> 02:07:03.805]  Well, that's right.
[02:07:03.825 --> 02:07:08.947]  From day one, we pointed out that they had these show trials that would do the same thing that happened in the Oliver North case.
[02:07:09.027 --> 02:07:10.367]  So the question is, why would they do this?
[02:07:10.387 --> 02:07:14.928]  Because they only care about the optics and demonizing their political opposition as terrorists.
[02:07:15.368 --> 02:07:16.188]  I think you both agree.
[02:07:16.208 --> 02:07:16.829]  Everybody agrees.
[02:07:16.849 --> 02:07:19.649]  Some people walk down the street and say, man, these hearings blew up in their face.
[02:07:20.590 --> 02:07:22.570]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, final segment here.
[02:07:22.590 --> 02:07:23.811]  Owen Troyer's done a great job.
[02:07:23.831 --> 02:07:25.391]  Paul Joseph Watson's about to take over.
[02:07:25.431 --> 02:07:28.032]  Pete Santilli and I are going to finish with some final comments here.
[02:07:28.052 --> 02:07:29.112]  But here's what I want to say again.
[02:07:30.054 --> 02:07:34.056]  Joe Biggs and all those people are political prisoners.
[02:07:34.096 --> 02:07:35.537]  They've had their due process violated.
[02:07:35.557 --> 02:07:40.319]  They've been holding people for years in solitary confinement.
[02:07:40.339 --> 02:07:43.701]  They have absolutely railroaded them, and if they can do this, they can railroad America.
[02:07:43.721 --> 02:07:55.734]   And now with these evil, unconstitutional, Constitution-raping These are all Americans' rights that are being trashed and being burned up in front of us if we don't reverse this.
[02:07:55.754 --> 02:08:14.879]  So we need to get angry, we need to get upset, and we need to not just have talk radio and what's left of conservative media that hasn't been censored into oblivion, to not just say, we know January 6th is hype, we don't want to hear about it, and realize this is the whole Democrat play, it's their whole operation to label us all domestic terrorists, and it is a central issue.
[02:08:16.115 --> 02:08:22.680]  To distract from the devaluation of the currency, the inflation, the tyranny, the collapsing borders, the human smuggling, just all the crimes they're committing.
[02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:24.982]  And so that's why this is so incredibly important.
[02:08:25.002 --> 02:08:34.429]  I'm really glad that Pete Santilli, who's a former political prisoner himself, that they had to release, it was proven that they were framing him, has been so, you know, on the ball fighting this, and as well as the rest of the crew.
[02:08:34.449 --> 02:08:38.852]  So I want to thank the listeners for their support and their prayers, because InfoWars is right in the crosshairs.
[02:08:39.493 --> 02:08:40.914]  Owen has been falsely charged.
[02:08:41.774 --> 02:08:45.937]  Uh, obviously with all this crazy stuff and it just shows you how serious and how real this is.
[02:08:45.957 --> 02:08:50.900]  Sam Montoya, our employee that just shot footage like any other journalist, they're trying to put him in prison.
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:53.062]  And so this is a very, very important time.
[02:08:53.082 --> 02:09:00.086]  Understand we need your prayers, we need your support here at InfoWars because we're under attack at every level because we're the people fighting for you.
[02:09:00.146 --> 02:09:02.028]  We're the people fighting for our own future together.
[02:09:02.868 --> 02:09:08.856]  And we just need your support at InfoWarStore.com more than ever because it takes money to fight George Soros and the Democratic Party.
[02:09:08.876 --> 02:09:10.017]  But we're winning hearts and minds.
[02:09:10.398 --> 02:09:11.279]  We're winning spiritually.
[02:09:11.299 --> 02:09:12.220]  We're winning culturally.
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:14.823]  And the enemy knows, and so throwing everything they've got at us.
[02:09:14.843 --> 02:09:17.606]  So I'm going to hand the baton back over to Pete Santilli and Owen Schroeder.
[02:09:17.666 --> 02:09:19.328]  And again, Paul Joseph Watson is coming up.
[02:09:19.749 --> 02:09:21.932]  I run into so many great people while I've been traveling on business.
[02:09:22.632 --> 02:09:26.775]  And I just want to salute everybody that's waking up and tell them to wake up others and just keep spreading the word.
[02:09:26.815 --> 02:09:28.196]  The chain reaction is happening.
[02:09:28.556 --> 02:09:34.540]  Victory is happening, but we've got to defend our political prisoners, ladies and gentlemen, or we will all suffer the same fate.
[02:09:34.701 --> 02:09:35.141]  God bless.
[02:09:35.241 --> 02:09:38.003]  I hand the baton over to Owen Schroer and Pete Centelli.
[02:09:38.423 --> 02:09:39.104]  That's right, Alex.
[02:09:39.124 --> 02:09:39.464]  Thank you.
[02:09:39.604 --> 02:09:41.986]  Pete, we've got just over two minutes left here.
[02:09:42.086 --> 02:09:43.847]  Why don't you give us some final departing words?
[02:09:45.151 --> 02:09:46.732]  You know, Owen, I'll mention you.
[02:09:46.792 --> 02:09:49.454]  You don't even need to respond back to it, but that's what I'll say.
[02:09:50.195 --> 02:10:05.327]  Not only have they falsely charged you, but they selectively charged you and targeted you because there were other journalists that went into the Capitol and done things even far worse than anything you were found to have done.
[02:10:07.829 --> 02:10:10.232]  So, selective and malicious prosecution.
[02:10:10.272 --> 02:10:22.928]  I'm also going to say this, that because of this appeal and what's about to be filed here imminently by the attorneys, en masse, all of the January 6th defendants are going to pile onto this thing and join in.
[02:10:23.892 --> 02:10:31.241]  It's already been ruled by an appellate court almost identical in the Ali North case that not only have they made egregious errors.
[02:10:31.682 --> 02:10:35.887]  Oh, and I'm going to throw back to you to also give you final word here and commentary.
[02:10:36.328 --> 02:10:41.014]  I believe that it was a fatal error by Liz.
[02:10:42.225 --> 02:10:51.570]  Halliburton, Cheney, she has totally and completely, and I think that's the reason, it wasn't a technical reason that they called the next hearing off.
[02:10:51.870 --> 02:10:59.074]  I think they were advised by counsel, you just destroyed all possibilities of prosecuting any one of these January 6th defendants.
[02:10:59.534 --> 02:11:01.475]  I'd say that there's a 99.99% chance they're gonna walk, all of them.
[02:11:06.016 --> 02:11:09.120]  Ask you the question that you've kind of already answered, but maybe just give it a new framing.
[02:11:10.582 --> 02:11:15.329]  You know, Liz Cheney jumped the shark here, maybe bit off more than she could chew.
[02:11:16.030 --> 02:11:20.576]  Or is this kind of a probing thing of the deep state to see what they can get away with?
[02:11:22.301 --> 02:11:23.862]  I would say no.
[02:11:24.302 --> 02:11:29.104]  I would say that I felt a sense of ultra urgency for political reasons.
[02:11:29.464 --> 02:11:34.507]  Because the DOJ, once you get close enough to the November elections, they won't prosecute anything.
[02:11:34.767 --> 02:11:37.648]  So any criminal referrals or anything that they're doing.
[02:11:37.708 --> 02:11:39.809]  So they had a short window of opportunity.
[02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:48.378]  I heard that they hired 600 attorneys a couple of months ago because they wanted to do the remaining filings by the end of May.
[02:11:49.019 --> 02:11:50.921]  Well, they've far surpassed that.
[02:11:50.981 --> 02:11:52.062]  Now they're into the hearings.
[02:11:52.983 --> 02:11:57.268]  Once you get close to the November election, the DOJ will not prosecute because it's political.
[02:11:58.283 --> 02:12:01.668]  So, she was rushed to judgment here.
[02:12:01.929 --> 02:12:05.334]  And she wanted to put herself to be judge, jury, and executioner, of course.
[02:12:05.635 --> 02:12:07.558]  Pete Santilli, thank you so much.
[02:12:07.598 --> 02:12:09.120]  The Pete Santilli Show.
[02:12:09.201 --> 02:12:12.201]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over the Alex Jones show now.
[02:12:12.201 --> 02:12:30.201]  [Music]
[02:12:30.201 --> 02:12:36.201]   Transmitting worldwide from the Summit.News studios in the United Kingdom,
[02:12:36.201 --> 02:12:40.201]  you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:12:40.201 --> 02:12:42.201]  [Music]
[02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:48.614]  Thursday, it is the 16th of June, it is 2022, and we are live!
[02:12:48.674 --> 02:13:15.423]   We've got a ton of news to cover over the course of the next hour, including, and once again we ask the question, is diversity a strength, especially as it applies to Europe, given the acceleration of migration that is taking place from the Middle East, from North Africa, to European countries, and what impact that is having, at least in the short term, not even to mention the long term, On culture, on society.
[02:13:15.803 --> 02:13:27.031]  Now I mention that because obviously later we're going to get into what is happening here in the UK with hundreds upon hundreds of boat migrants arriving from the war-torn country of France.
[02:13:27.091 --> 02:13:29.312]  Apparently France is no longer a safe country.
[02:13:29.393 --> 02:13:37.058]  No, they have to come here because the government rewards them with, well for a start, a free taxi service when they get near the shore.
[02:13:37.817 --> 02:13:55.105]  and free hotel accommodation as well as free cash, free food, all generous little benefits that these economic migrants, the vast majority of them young fighting age men, do not get in the quote war-torn country of France.
[02:13:55.586 --> 02:13:58.287]  What impact is that having on European countries?
[02:13:59.341 --> 02:14:10.192]  Well, I come on this show basically every week and say there's a massive, buried, ignored story that should be global news right now, which is only news in its host country.
[02:14:10.732 --> 02:14:11.934]  And this week it's Italy.
[02:14:12.454 --> 02:14:19.021]  Because we had, of course, the Cologne mass molestation back on New Year's Eve 2015, which did make the news.
[02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:36.501]  Where huge gangs of North African migrants, primarily from Algeria, conducted attacks, sexual assaults, molestations and physical full-on rapes of German women outside the Cologne train station during the New Year's Eve celebrations in 2015.
[02:14:36.961 --> 02:14:54.146]   Now, of course, very few people got prosecuted for that, but it did start a national conversation over the sanctity, over the Benefits of importing a million migrants, which of course Germany did from 2015 onwards.
[02:14:54.227 --> 02:14:56.088]  Merkel claimed it was a huge success.
[02:14:56.688 --> 02:15:00.170]  What's happened in Germany since tends to argue in the opposite direction.
[02:15:01.038 --> 02:15:09.001]  But again, a huge ignored story, this time out of Italy, and Remix News has done a full breakdown of this, rmx.news.
[02:15:09.662 --> 02:15:19.366]  Italian Parliament opens investigation after hundreds of migrants blamed for unleashing hell at lakeside towns with rioting and sexual assaults.
[02:15:19.846 --> 02:15:22.227]  This should be one of the top stories in the world.
[02:15:22.687 --> 02:15:24.188]  It happened about a week ago.
[02:15:24.588 --> 02:15:27.009]  It's barely made a ripple.
[02:15:27.510 --> 02:15:43.069]   Now, it's interesting that this happened around Lake Garda, And in the villages and towns in between that circle Lake Garda, given that, of course, that's where George Clooney, the actor, owns one of his many multi-million dollar mansions.
[02:15:43.710 --> 02:15:53.358]  Now, of course, back in, I think it was 2015, 2016, Clooney said that he would be open to inviting a refugee to stay in his own home.
[02:15:54.221 --> 02:15:57.082]  And to be fair to him, unlike others, people like J.K.
[02:15:57.142 --> 02:15:58.963]  Rowling, he actually did that.
[02:15:58.983 --> 02:15:59.984]  He followed through on it.
[02:16:00.024 --> 02:16:06.367]  Of course, the migrant refugee that he invited turned out to be a well-educated doctor.
[02:16:07.267 --> 02:16:09.909]  We're not being deluged with doctors and lawyers.
[02:16:09.949 --> 02:16:12.790]  Let's just say that based on the raw statistics alone.
[02:16:13.230 --> 02:16:21.274]  But again, that signalled Clooney's virtue that he wanted these migrants, these refugees, to be brought into Europe.
[02:16:21.957 --> 02:16:30.624]  And now they've run riot near Lake Garda, around the very same area that he owns one of his multiple mansions.
[02:16:31.325 --> 02:16:45.056]  Last week saw widespread chaos break out in parties in Italian lakeside towns near Lake Garda, involving up to 2,000 migrants, deluged these small towns and villages.
[02:16:45.689 --> 02:17:02.841]  The Italian Public Prosecutor's Office and the Italian Parliament have opened a number of investigations, which will probably go nowhere, because they always do, including one case where 30 migrant men allegedly sexually assaulted 16 girls on a train from Lake Garda to Milan.
[02:17:03.562 --> 02:17:06.264]  These migrant youths poured into these villages.
[02:17:06.364 --> 02:17:10.487]  This was obviously predetermined, pre-arranged attack.
[02:17:10.867 --> 02:17:22.461]   They smashed shop windows, they assaulted people on the streets, They stole people's belongings and they sexually harassed young girls, in some cases, children.
[02:17:23.541 --> 02:17:25.602]  And what did they say while they were doing this?
[02:17:25.662 --> 02:17:39.849]  Well, in the act of carrying out this absolute carnage, they were waving the flags of African countries and they were openly saying, we're here to invade, no white people are allowed here.
[02:17:39.889 --> 02:17:42.650]  In fact, I'm going to get onto the exact quotes in a second.
[02:17:44.301 --> 02:17:47.282]  But again, this was under the guise of a street party.
[02:17:47.683 --> 02:17:50.844]  The majority of these migrants, the vast majority, were North African.
[02:17:50.884 --> 02:17:53.285]  It's the same demographic that we see over and over again.
[02:17:53.665 --> 02:17:57.007]  Some were sub-Saharan African from the videos that I've seen.
[02:17:58.767 --> 02:18:05.170]  They destroyed everything, said a business owner speaking with Corriere della Sera, one of Italy's biggest newspapers.
[02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:11.493]  They broke shop windows, stormed the tourist train, and blocked passers-by on foot or by moped.
[02:18:12.421 --> 02:18:13.642]  Riot police arrived.
[02:18:13.782 --> 02:18:21.665]  Imagine this, a peaceful tourist lakeside village, and riot police have to show up to deal with this.
[02:18:22.406 --> 02:18:23.286]  Is that a strength?
[02:18:23.927 --> 02:18:30.690]  Is that really something that we should be encouraging in our European villages, in holiday tourist resorts?
[02:18:31.650 --> 02:18:35.372]  When riot police attempted to intervene, the group of teens began throwing stones.
[02:18:36.212 --> 02:18:46.792]   I don't know if they were first or second generation immigrants, said Oreyeta Ghali, the mayor of Peshira, They're just a race of criminals who have left a deep wound in my community.
[02:18:47.233 --> 02:18:49.715]  We lived a day of war.
[02:18:50.055 --> 02:18:51.916]  It was absolute bedlam.
[02:18:52.096 --> 02:18:56.059]  And again, no global mainstream media coverage whatsoever.
[02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:01.303]  One video shows a group attacking a motorcyclist, causing a traffic jam.
[02:19:01.764 --> 02:19:05.467]  Another video shows them trying to tear away another passenger's purse.
[02:19:06.528 --> 02:19:14.104]   Another Twitter user who posted a video of the incident wrote, Quote, thousands of immigrants unleash hell in Pechera, Delgada.
[02:19:14.485 --> 02:19:21.051]  Vandalism, fights, clashes with police, stabbings, families robbed, tourists terrified and forced to flee.
[02:19:21.451 --> 02:19:26.436]  The process of integrating migrants in Italy has clearly failed.
[02:19:27.136 --> 02:19:44.100]   Remember a couple of weeks ago we had the Swedish Prime Minister, left-wing Swedish feminist Prime Minister, come out and admit that their attempts to integrate, to absorb such huge numbers of migrants in that Scandinavian country have, again, completely failed.
[02:19:44.561 --> 02:19:59.066]   We had the top left-wing Belgian political leader come out a few weeks before that And say he was driving through Molenbeek, which is a suburb of Brussels in Belgium, and he felt that it no longer resembled Belgium at all.
[02:19:59.547 --> 02:20:06.812]  These no-go zones, these ghettos, are getting worse and worse and worse because more of the same demographic is pouring in.
[02:20:07.193 --> 02:20:09.394]  The sexual assaults continue to happen.
[02:20:09.995 --> 02:20:16.160]  The mass robbings continue to happen, as we saw before the Champions League final in Paris last month.
[02:20:16.986 --> 02:20:23.351]  The only difference is, back in 2015, 16, 17, these were major stories.
[02:20:23.831 --> 02:20:34.159]  These were the centerpiece of massive conversations about whether indeed diversity is a strength, whether this rate of accelerated migration is happening too quickly.
[02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:37.382]  Now, you don't even hear about it.
[02:20:38.064 --> 02:20:41.767]  The Champions League final thing was one of the biggest stories of the year.
[02:20:42.328 --> 02:20:43.248]  I follow this.
[02:20:43.669 --> 02:20:47.632]  I didn't even know it had happened until almost a week afterwards.
[02:20:48.593 --> 02:20:51.855]  Same thing with this series of incidents in Italy.
[02:20:52.456 --> 02:21:04.886]  Days later, I find out about it through what to the average normie would be relatively obscure websites which track this kind of thing and which get translated reports out of countries like Italy.
[02:21:05.879 --> 02:21:09.084]  So again, it's under investigation, just like the Champions League.
[02:21:09.966 --> 02:21:14.272]  Riot, Chaos is under investigation, which again, the process is the cover-up.
[02:21:14.573 --> 02:21:18.439]  The investigation is the cover-up and we're going to get into that in the next segment.
[02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:21.926]   But again, Sexually assaulted girls.
[02:21:22.006 --> 02:21:27.487]  It's the same demographic that mass molested women in Cologne, Germany back in 2015.
[02:21:28.188 --> 02:21:29.468]  Italy is dealing with this.
[02:21:30.108 --> 02:21:40.812]  They recently released criminal statistics which found that migrants, despite again making up a small portion of their population, account for nearly half of rapes in Italy.
[02:21:41.432 --> 02:22:00.139]  And we continue to import this same culture in different European countries with devastating impacts, not just in terms of crime and sexual assaults, but as with the Manchester Arena bombing carried out by a refugee rescued by our own government, deathly terrorist jihadist attacks.
[02:22:00.599 --> 02:22:05.081]  We're going to come back, get more into this, get into what's happening with the boat migrant crisis in England.
[02:22:05.121 --> 02:22:07.022]  This is The Summit News, our Summit.News.
[02:22:07.082 --> 02:22:07.462]  We'll be back.
[02:22:08.305 --> 02:22:24.220]  So, 2,000 migrant men from North African countries, or at least North African migrant background, invaded this small village and a series of villages and towns around Lake Garda in Italy, a tourist area.
[02:22:24.900 --> 02:22:33.188]  These incidents were pre-arranged and they were convened as Remix News reports under the slogan, African Impesciera.
[02:22:33.723 --> 02:22:39.366]  They were waving Moroccan flags, the flags of other African countries.
[02:22:40.267 --> 02:22:55.355]  Breitbart reports on the comments of some of these individuals, which again were mostly young men aged between 16 and 20, attacking people, sexually assaulting women, throwing objects at the police, smashing into shop windows, stealing people's belongings.
[02:22:56.144 --> 02:22:58.565]  What did they say while they were carrying out this carnage?
[02:22:59.025 --> 02:23:07.028]  Quote, we came here to reconquer Pesciera, this is our territory, Africa must come here.
[02:23:07.769 --> 02:23:28.693]   Now at least for an hour or two of absolute bedlam, Africa did come to Pesciera around Lake Garda in Italy and I think we can conclude from what happened that Africa coming to Europe is certainly not a good development, and it certainly goes some way to disprove the mantra that diversity is a strength.
[02:23:29.813 --> 02:23:34.615]  Now, why this is even more concerning, because a survey came out a few days ago.
[02:23:34.676 --> 02:23:35.056]  Headline!
[02:23:35.896 --> 02:23:36.276]  Survey!
[02:23:36.316 --> 02:23:38.778]  More than half of young people want to leave Africa!
[02:23:40.238 --> 02:23:40.799]  Great!
[02:23:41.139 --> 02:23:42.119]  Where do they want to come?
[02:23:42.159 --> 02:23:43.520]  They want to come to Europe!
[02:23:44.275 --> 02:23:53.239]  A new survey of 15 African countries has found that more than half of young people want to leave the continent in the coming years, with the majority of those who emigrate expected to head to Europe.
[02:23:53.899 --> 02:24:04.723]  And again, you have to put in the proviso, hashtag not all Africans, if I came from some s-hole country in Africa, I'd be the same as them, I'd want to go to Europe.
[02:24:05.644 --> 02:24:13.827]  Yes, obviously the vast majority of them are not going to rape women, they're not going to commit crimes, but a significant enough portion of them do.
[02:24:14.631 --> 02:24:21.718]  And if you invite millions and millions of Africans into Europe, Europe is going to become more like Africa.
[02:24:22.179 --> 02:24:26.703]  Which is not a good thing, because why are they leaving Africa in the first place?
[02:24:29.707 --> 02:24:37.675]  Now we had this story, and I'm going to get to the video about the Champions League final, because again, more updates on that cover up in full swing.
[02:24:38.655 --> 02:24:41.398]  But again, this is another story that got zero attention.
[02:24:41.898 --> 02:24:44.600]  It was in Swedish media for a day, then it was forgotten.
[02:24:45.161 --> 02:24:53.308]  Father of Swedish child Islamic terror victim says her stock home grave has been desecrated over 100 times.
[02:24:53.989 --> 02:24:56.191]  This is the father of Eber Akerlund.
[02:24:56.690 --> 02:25:13.420]  The 11-year-old Swedish girl who was torn limb from limb on the streets of Stockholm by an Islamic terrorist, an illegal migrant, oh and by the way, a refugee, a rejected asylum seeker from Uzbekistan, back in 2017.
[02:25:13.900 --> 02:25:19.644]  The attack killed 5 people, it seriously injured 14 others, it's probably a miracle that it didn't kill more than that.
[02:25:20.919 --> 02:25:24.921]  Obviously that event, on a standalone basis, is horrific enough.
[02:25:24.981 --> 02:25:34.507]  Of course in the broader context of what happened over the course of those years, it's kind of tailed off a little bit, thankfully, because Trump kicked ISIS's ass.
[02:25:35.506 --> 02:25:37.906]  And these attacks stopped happening to some extent.
[02:25:37.926 --> 02:25:39.047]  They're still attempting them.
[02:25:39.307 --> 02:25:58.271]  We've been lucky over the past couple of years, several of them have been stopped, unlike the Manchester bombing, which wasn't stopped because the police and security guards feared being called racist, even though they saw a young Muslim fiddling with a huge backpack right before he blew himself up and killed 23 people, a lot of them children.
[02:25:58.951 --> 02:26:08.157]   But again, I guess not being called racist is kind of more important than saving the lives of children from being Blown up and dismembered limb from limb, isn't it?
[02:26:09.398 --> 02:26:15.381]  So this 11 year old Swedish girl, killed by a terrorist, that's not enough apparently.
[02:26:15.901 --> 02:26:28.847]  She's buried in Stockholm, which again is absorbing huge numbers of these Islamic migrants, and her grave in Stockholm has been desecrated a hundred times, at least.
[02:26:29.488 --> 02:26:33.449]  And they won't even install CCTV to try and catch the perpetrators.
[02:26:33.829 --> 02:26:37.851]  They caught one of them back in 2018, and guess what?
[02:26:37.871 --> 02:26:40.551]  He turned out to be an illegal migrant, a refugee.
[02:26:40.672 --> 02:26:41.572]  Imagine my shock.
[02:26:42.332 --> 02:26:49.074]  So it's not enough to kill an 11-year-old girl by ramming a truck into her, tearing her limb from limb.
[02:26:49.374 --> 02:26:53.255]  Any of you who've seen the pictures will know the scale of this horror.
[02:26:53.936 --> 02:26:54.116]  No.
[02:26:54.596 --> 02:26:57.897]  They have to literally desecrate her grave in Stockholm.
[02:26:59.062 --> 02:27:01.023]  For what message to send, I don't know.
[02:27:01.143 --> 02:27:02.984]  I mean, the mind boggles at this point.
[02:27:03.325 --> 02:27:06.987]  But again, he's out in the media desperately complaining.
[02:27:07.887 --> 02:27:18.013]  This bereaved father who visits his lost daughter's grave every day at 10am to say good morning, every evening at 6pm to say goodnight.
[02:27:18.293 --> 02:27:28.159]  He's going back there, the little trinkets he's left, the flowers in honour of his slain daughter, have been stolen, have been ripped up, have been smashed.
[02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:29.681]  desecrated.
[02:27:30.441 --> 02:27:42.431]  This is happening in a European capital city, and again it was in the news for a day in Sweden, nobody knows about it, and all those protesters are out on the streets once again.
[02:27:42.772 --> 02:27:54.181]  They're down in Dover with their little placards, refugees welcome, not even considering for a second the absolute carnage and horror that this policy has visited on Europe.
[02:27:55.512 --> 02:27:59.274]  Putin plans to weaponize refugees to generate instability in Europe.
[02:27:59.294 --> 02:28:00.274]  But wait!
[02:28:00.594 --> 02:28:02.595]  Refugees welcome diversities of strength.
[02:28:03.075 --> 02:28:16.221]  Why would he be weaponizing refugees to cause instability in Europe unless mass waves of unintegrated migrants cause instability in the host countries that they come to?
[02:28:17.761 --> 02:28:19.382]  And again, we had a story last week.
[02:28:20.701 --> 02:28:24.164]  President Erdogan out of Turkey has been doing exactly the same thing.
[02:28:24.184 --> 02:28:27.086]  He threatens Greece over and over again.
[02:28:27.126 --> 02:28:36.712]  If you try and block this sale of fighter jets from America to Turkey, I will unleash another wave of refugees to culturally enrich your country.
[02:28:37.753 --> 02:28:49.581]  If it's such a good thing, and if there are no overwhelmingly negative consequences of absorbing all these refugees, why are world leaders threatening to use them as weapons against countries they don't like?
[02:28:50.549 --> 02:28:51.730]  Interesting that, isn't it?
[02:28:54.173 --> 02:28:54.713]  Switzerland.
[02:28:54.773 --> 02:29:01.760]  Illegal immigrant attacks massive church organ recently restored for €530,000 in a Swiss city.
[02:29:02.902 --> 02:29:06.665]  Syrian migrant blames rape of eight-year-old stepdaughter on alcohol.
[02:29:07.126 --> 02:29:09.608]  Claims she's older than that in her head.
[02:29:10.369 --> 02:29:10.750]  Nice!
[02:29:12.291 --> 02:29:23.369]   And then off the backdrop of all this, We have a border policy situation in the United Kingdom, which I'm going to get into in the next segment, where the government said, don't worry, we've got a solution.
[02:29:23.770 --> 02:29:47.149]   As we literally roll out the red carpet and invite all these migrants in from the war-torn country of France, which apparently is too intolerable for them to stay there, rescue them in Royal Navy boats, rescue them in charity boats, put them up in 30,000 hotel rooms at a cost of £5 million a day to the taxpayer, Hundreds and hundreds coming in every day.
[02:29:47.169 --> 02:29:49.412]  50,000 have come in so far since 2018.
[02:29:49.452 --> 02:29:50.774]  Maybe 100,000 more are going to come in this year.
[02:29:54.838 --> 02:29:57.359]  Their solution to that is to send them to Rwanda.
[02:29:57.620 --> 02:30:05.184]  These left-wing groups, the European Court of Human Rights and activist judges in the United Kingdom say, no, you're not doing that.
[02:30:05.444 --> 02:30:17.050]  This is the same government that locked us down overnight with no legal hurdles, but apparently they can't deport a single illegal immigrant without the entire farce of a policy collapsing.
[02:30:17.873 --> 02:30:32.639]  And I've got a couple of videos on that which I'm going to get into in the next segment and then we're going to contrast it with what is happening as these illegals are given royal treatment to British citizens who post offensive memes in private chat groups.
[02:30:32.659 --> 02:30:33.479]  You're not going to believe this.
[02:30:33.519 --> 02:30:34.039]  We'll be back.
[02:30:34.079 --> 02:30:34.740]  Summit.News.
[02:30:34.900 --> 02:30:35.320]  Don't go away.
[02:30:36.107 --> 02:30:41.434]  Well I've been rambling on for two segments now and if I don't get to these videos I'll never get to them.
[02:30:41.615 --> 02:30:55.752]   We'll come back and we'll talk about the ramifications of this but first let's go to this video which focuses on the UK angle, the absolute shambles of UK borders This video is called an absolute farce.
[02:30:56.052 --> 02:30:56.733]  Let's roll it.
[02:30:56.833 --> 02:30:57.253]  Here it is.
[02:30:57.793 --> 02:31:04.137]  The British government's naff attempt to deal with uncontrolled immigration has been an absolute shambles.
[02:31:04.237 --> 02:31:19.848]   You mean the same government that literally provides a taxi service for illegal boat migrants, incentivizing them to come here from France and rewarding criminal people smugglers before Or putting them up in hotels at taxpayer expense is completely useless when it comes to trying to deport them.
[02:31:19.908 --> 02:31:21.609]  Wow, who could have foreseen that?
[02:31:21.689 --> 02:31:30.655]  Thanks to mobs of protesters and activist judges, the first flight of illegal migrants being deported to Rwanda was whittled down to just a handful.
[02:31:30.736 --> 02:31:37.180]  Then, thanks to an intervention by the European Court of Human Rights, the plane didn't take off at all.
[02:31:37.220 --> 02:31:39.442]  The European Court of Human Rights?
[02:31:39.742 --> 02:31:42.644]  I thought we'd voted to leave the European Union.
[02:31:42.924 --> 02:31:45.446]  Doesn't matter, we're still taking orders from them.
[02:31:45.606 --> 02:31:47.368]  It's an absolute farce.
[02:31:47.448 --> 02:31:56.334]  This is the same Tory government that locked down the entire population of the country, overnight, with no legal hurdles whatsoever.
[02:31:56.434 --> 02:32:01.498]  Yet when it comes to deporting a single migrant, they're rendered completely impotent.
[02:32:01.598 --> 02:32:07.423]  Where were all those activist judges in March 2020 when Brits were placed under de facto house arrest?
[02:32:07.543 --> 02:32:15.468]  They're more interested in protecting the rights of illegal migrants who broke the law to get here than the rights of actual British citizens.
[02:32:15.568 --> 02:32:16.369]  Case in point!
[02:32:16.489 --> 02:32:28.617]  While economic migrants fleeing the war-torn country of... France are treated like royalty because of activist judges, British citizens are being thrown in prison for sharing edgy memes.
[02:32:28.837 --> 02:32:30.918]  No, this is not a Babylon Bee story.
[02:32:31.038 --> 02:32:40.162]  A man was actually given 20 weeks in prison by a judge for posting offensive George Floyd memes in private chat groups.
[02:32:40.362 --> 02:32:43.703]  Absolute, unmitigated, weapons-grade clam world.
[02:32:43.803 --> 02:32:49.345]  Priti Patel says critics have no alternative proposals to deal with uncontrolled immigration.
[02:32:49.446 --> 02:32:50.386]  Here's a proposal.
[02:32:50.726 --> 02:32:54.067]  Stop rolling out the red carpet for them in the first place!
[02:32:54.267 --> 02:33:00.710]  Italy's Matteo Salvini halved the number of migrant deaths at sea by vowing to turn the boats back.
[02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:04.791]  It saves migrant lives and it saves the lives of Westerners.
[02:33:04.891 --> 02:33:12.174]  Lest we forget, the Manchester Arena bomber was literally rescued as a refugee by our Royal Navy.
[02:33:12.234 --> 02:33:18.073]   And despite numerous police officers and security guards witnessing his overtly suspicious behaviour,
[02:33:18.073 --> 02:33:21.873]  they refused to stop him for fear of being called racist.
[02:33:21.873 --> 02:33:29.033]   Shortly after, he blew himself up, killing 23 and injuring over a thousand people, many of them children.
[02:33:29.033 --> 02:33:36.134]   Now our pathetic government is being bullied into submission by far-left protesters, the EU, and activist
[02:33:36.134 --> 02:33:38.554]  judges, for fear of being called racist.
[02:33:38.554 --> 02:33:44.873]   Having handed Rwanda 120 million quid up front as part of this genius plan.
[02:33:44.888 --> 02:33:52.091]  Nearly a thousand boat migrants have arrived in Britain since Sunday alone, while they failed to deport a single migrant to Rwanda.
[02:33:52.171 --> 02:33:53.871]  Again, almost all of them young men.
[02:33:54.111 --> 02:33:59.673]  Economic migrants coming from France, a safe country, to the benefits haven of Great Britain.
[02:33:59.793 --> 02:34:04.336]  Now the migrants who are supposed to be deported to Rwanda have been set loose in the community.
[02:34:04.397 --> 02:34:11.802]  By the end of the year, if nothing changes, a hundred thousand boat migrants are expected to enter Britain.
[02:34:11.842 --> 02:34:22.130]  While they continue to be looked after in hotels or huge numbers of them dumped on tiny villages like Linton on Ouse, just grow a frigging spine and enforce the law.
[02:34:22.390 --> 02:34:23.591]  How hard can it be?
[02:34:26.193 --> 02:34:28.475]  Now I mentioned it in that video.
[02:34:29.564 --> 02:34:35.725]  I mean, I'm not surprised by much these days, but sometimes you see these stories, and it is a facepalm moment.
[02:34:36.305 --> 02:34:50.048]  Yes, a man was arrested in the UK, a former police officer, and convicted for posting offensive George Floyd memes in private WhatsApp and Facebook group chats.
[02:34:50.448 --> 02:34:54.169]  Back in 2020, he committed this horrendous thought crime.
[02:34:55.123 --> 02:35:00.126]  He's literally going to prison for posting edgy memes in a private group chat.
[02:35:00.446 --> 02:35:16.617]  Again, this is in a country where the police came out, the National Police Chief Council, back in 2015, and said their resources are too stretched, there isn't enough time to deal with the crimes, and they can't attend burglaries.
[02:35:17.077 --> 02:35:23.322]  In 2018 it was revealed that two-thirds of burglaries in the United Kingdom aren't even investigated.
[02:35:23.583 --> 02:35:35.873]  But they have the resources to investigate, to prosecute, to convict, to imprison a 31-year-old man for posting funny memes on a Facebook private chat group.
[02:35:37.254 --> 02:35:39.436]  Absolutely incredible!
[02:35:40.296 --> 02:35:42.158]  And then you look further into the details.
[02:35:43.456 --> 02:35:51.181]  This guy, by the way, could have probably won this if he hadn't cowed and submitted at the start by apologising and saying he was sorry.
[02:35:51.501 --> 02:35:53.683]  If he'd have actually got a decent lawyer, he would have won.
[02:35:54.083 --> 02:35:54.583]  But he didn't.
[02:35:54.603 --> 02:36:02.829]  Because there's another case of one of his colleagues who did the same egregious behaviour of posting offensive memes, who is now on trial for the same thing.
[02:36:03.689 --> 02:36:13.814]  But when the judge handed down this prison sentence, he openly said he was making an example of this individual former police officer, James Watts.
[02:36:14.574 --> 02:36:21.278]  He said, quote, a message must go out and that message can only go out through an immediate sentence of imprisonment.
[02:36:22.628 --> 02:36:29.249]  This guy is in prison for posting a meme that made fun of George Floyd.
[02:36:29.529 --> 02:36:32.410]  He didn't even post it publicly on the internet.
[02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:34.910]  He posted it in a private chat group.
[02:36:35.430 --> 02:36:37.811]  Someone ratted him out to the authorities.
[02:36:38.571 --> 02:36:39.731]  And now he's a criminal.
[02:36:40.211 --> 02:36:41.851]  And that's on his record for life.
[02:36:46.052 --> 02:36:46.992]  This is the kicker.
[02:36:47.933 --> 02:37:00.604]   The guy, because he was in the prison system, Because he was basically part of society, which is how everyone has to go through this social engineering, diversity training, brainwashing.
[02:37:01.364 --> 02:37:13.769]  While giving him the sentence, the judge, on top of that, lectured him that he should have known better because he received, quote, training in relation to diversity and inclusion.
[02:37:15.769 --> 02:37:17.310]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:37:17.370 --> 02:37:19.150]  The judge, by the way, was a migrant.
[02:37:19.391 --> 02:37:20.511]  That's quite funny, isn't it?
[02:37:21.960 --> 02:37:32.213]  In 2017, it was reported that British police had arrested 3,395 people for offensive online comments in the space of a single year.
[02:37:32.433 --> 02:37:34.115]  But they can't attend burglaries.
[02:37:34.175 --> 02:37:35.898]  If you get robbed, you're screwed.
[02:37:36.078 --> 02:37:37.399]  They don't have the resources.
[02:37:37.740 --> 02:37:40.944]  Post a spicy meme about George Floyd, get in prison.
[02:37:43.107 --> 02:37:45.971]  Absolute weapons grade clown world!
[02:37:46.471 --> 02:37:57.285]  Meanwhile migrants landing in Britain will refuse to board Rwanda flights and warned policy won't stop them crossing the Channel as 677 arrive in two days and two boats are brought ashore at Dover today.
[02:37:57.906 --> 02:38:06.408]   If you get on a boat and break the law by entering the country And then are just set loose in the community to get up to whatever you want.
[02:38:06.468 --> 02:38:13.313]  And as we saw in Italy, as we saw before the Champions League final a couple of weeks ago, they really do enrich us culturally.
[02:38:14.634 --> 02:38:26.282]  You get treated like literal royalty, you get free hotel rooms, you get free cash, you get free food, you get free Wi-Fi, which then the migrants complain about because their iPhones don't work properly because they're so oppressed.
[02:38:27.950 --> 02:38:53.537]  That's all good and dandy, but if as a British citizen you post a spicy meme on Facebook private chat group, not only will you be investigated, they seized his phone, convicted, sent to prison for 20 weeks, while you're being sent down the judge will lecture you about how you should have known better because you went through the social engineering, diversity training, brainwashing.
[02:38:54.397 --> 02:38:56.578]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:38:57.870 --> 02:38:59.412]  I'm going to come back in the next segment.
[02:38:59.492 --> 02:39:06.559]  I think we'll play the Champions League video because then again there's an update on that case and it ties into everything that I've been saying.
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:09.002]  Also get a little bit into Covid.
[02:39:09.162 --> 02:39:19.339]   Anthony Fauci has had four, count them, four Covid-19 vaccinations and he just has tested positive for Covid once again.
[02:39:19.399 --> 02:39:38.685]   This is the same guy who says he won't go to White House events because he doesn't want to risk spreading the disease or catching the disease but then the night before the White House press events he'll go to a private party And getting close proximity with Don Lemon and all the other people attending without wearing a face mask.
[02:39:39.005 --> 02:39:40.465]  And that's all good.
[02:39:40.765 --> 02:39:43.566]  And, well, we'll get into the latest on Monkeypox.
[02:39:43.686 --> 02:39:51.389]  And if we've got time, we'll dig into the latest benefits that the much-wanted LGBT community is offering up.
[02:39:51.429 --> 02:39:52.029]  Summit.News.
[02:39:52.069 --> 02:39:52.649]  We'll be back now.
[02:39:52.669 --> 02:39:52.909]  Go away.
[02:39:53.704 --> 02:40:01.154]  Now, we are going to try and get through at least two of these videos because I've only played one because I've been ranting for the entire show.
[02:40:01.274 --> 02:40:03.957]  Let's round up on the whole migrant situation with this video.
[02:40:04.478 --> 02:40:11.066]  Of course, I talked about at the top of the show the mass molestation of women, the crimes that took place around Lake Garda in Italy.
[02:40:11.650 --> 02:40:16.812]  We also had similar scenes before the Champions League final in Paris a couple of weeks ago.
[02:40:17.232 --> 02:40:25.395]  But now, during the course of the investigation, we learned that the footage, which would have shown who was responsible, has been mysteriously deleted!
[02:40:25.835 --> 02:40:26.555]  It's gone!
[02:40:26.575 --> 02:40:27.676]  Here's the video.
[02:40:27.696 --> 02:40:28.236]  Let's roll it.
[02:40:30.387 --> 02:40:34.451]  So Rwanda, when that announcement was made, I told you there'd be a problem.
[02:40:34.731 --> 02:40:38.054]  I predicted that the European Court of Human Rights would get involved.
[02:40:38.135 --> 02:40:39.716]  Of course, no one listened.
[02:40:39.756 --> 02:40:40.597]  They never do.
[02:40:40.957 --> 02:40:44.741]  And we were given assurances by Priti Patel and Boris Johnson that all would be well.
[02:40:45.181 --> 02:40:46.483]  This policy would happen.
[02:40:46.503 --> 02:40:48.725]  They've even launched a Facebook campaign.
[02:40:49.205 --> 02:40:52.450]  Saying to people, don't come to Britain or you might end up in Rwanda.
[02:40:52.970 --> 02:40:54.693]  Well, here we are in Brexit Britain.
[02:40:54.933 --> 02:41:18.630]   We voted not to have European courts making decisions over our lives and yet on that runway yesterday at Boscombe Down, The last few people who were due to go to Rwanda, the previous lot, all having been taken off because of the Human Rights Act, and we had an intervention from the Strasbourg Court, which means that no one left for Rwanda yesterday.
[02:41:18.990 --> 02:41:23.371]  Oh, by the way, 444 came in through Dover yesterday.
[02:41:23.911 --> 02:41:27.152]  As I speak this morning, there are loads more crossing the channel.
[02:41:27.712 --> 02:41:34.735]   There are going to be, over the course of the next few months, tens of thousands of young men that come across the English Channel.
[02:41:35.175 --> 02:41:39.157]  According to the Today programme this morning, they're all desperate people.
[02:41:39.257 --> 02:41:40.737]  Well, some may be.
[02:41:41.038 --> 02:41:44.259]  The vast majority are coming here for purely economic reasons.
[02:41:44.299 --> 02:41:51.062]  And many, of course, will finish up in this country in a form of modern day slavery and a form of criminality.
[02:41:51.542 --> 02:41:52.403]  So what happens now?
[02:41:53.223 --> 02:41:55.485]  Well, as ever, Boris will bluster.
[02:41:55.545 --> 02:41:58.668]  Well, we'll have to look at possibly changing legislation.
[02:41:59.288 --> 02:42:04.813]  And in two weeks' time, Dominic Raab, you know the one, the guy that looks like a rabbit in the headlights.
[02:42:04.933 --> 02:42:07.295]  God knows how people like this are running up our country.
[02:42:07.815 --> 02:42:15.618]   He will introduce a British Bill of Rights and we'll be told it will amend It will amend the Human Rights Act.
[02:42:16.058 --> 02:42:17.380]  It will make no difference.
[02:42:18.161 --> 02:42:24.628]  And our newspapers, the front pages, will go on and on and on condemning lefty judges.
[02:42:25.168 --> 02:42:28.432]  But it's just like the same argument about EU membership.
[02:42:28.772 --> 02:42:34.658]  For years and years and years, politicians and press moaned about decisions taken with the European Union.
[02:42:35.839 --> 02:42:39.244]  It was UKIP that said, let's end this, let's leave.
[02:42:39.605 --> 02:42:40.125]  We left.
[02:42:40.546 --> 02:42:43.310]  We thought in doing so, there'd be no more foreign courts.
[02:42:43.370 --> 02:42:47.055]  We thought in doing so, we'd get back control of our borders.
[02:42:47.496 --> 02:42:53.922]   And now we find, because Boris didn't do Brexit properly, Because we stayed part of the ECHR.
[02:42:54.422 --> 02:42:56.723]  Oh, and they'll tell you it's different to the EU.
[02:42:56.743 --> 02:43:03.805]  Well, believe you me, in Strasbourg you can walk from the European Parliament through the corridors straight into the European Court.
[02:43:03.825 --> 02:43:06.506]  They are completely interconnected.
[02:43:07.406 --> 02:43:12.328]  I don't think this government have got the guts to grasp this nettle.
[02:43:12.888 --> 02:43:14.429]  They fear being condemned.
[02:43:15.069 --> 02:43:24.815]  But they're being condemned anyway by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Prince Charles, the media, most people in Parliament, including many on the Conservative side.
[02:43:25.296 --> 02:43:27.017]  This, folks, is Brexit 2.0.
[02:43:28.217 --> 02:43:33.120]  This is about are we really going to get back control of our country and our borders.
[02:43:33.561 --> 02:43:38.804]  We should not be continuing to be bound by a 1951 convention from the UN.
[02:43:39.124 --> 02:43:47.329]   We should not have That European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg overriding a Supreme Court decision yesterday.
[02:43:48.190 --> 02:43:58.356]  Okay, that is Nigel Farage talking about the disastrous Rwanda migrant policy which has fallen flat on its face and failed in the United Kingdom over the past 48 hours.
[02:43:58.837 --> 02:44:04.520]  We got the order mixed up but we're going to go to this video now because I talked about what happened in Italy earlier on in the show.
[02:44:04.580 --> 02:44:10.768]   Similar scenes unplayed in Paris before the Champions League final a couple of weeks ago.
[02:44:11.209 --> 02:44:14.294]  This video is called It's Mysteriously Disappeared.
[02:44:14.314 --> 02:44:17.760]  The footage showing what happened has just vanished.
[02:44:18.101 --> 02:44:18.542]  It's gone.
[02:44:18.562 --> 02:44:19.263]  Here's a clip.
[02:44:21.172 --> 02:44:33.343]  Given that authorities in Paris promised to conduct a full investigation into the chaos that occurred before the Champions League final, you'd think they'd have requested all the security footage from around the ground showing what happened.
[02:44:34.304 --> 02:44:35.265]  And it's gone, yeah.
[02:44:35.525 --> 02:44:42.111]  All the evidence showing who was behind the rioting, robbing and violent attacks on Liverpool and Real Madrid supporters.
[02:44:42.671 --> 02:44:43.773]  Has been deleted.
[02:44:43.953 --> 02:44:44.394]  Whoops!
[02:44:44.494 --> 02:44:52.104]  The Stade de France said it wiped the footage after a week, as is standard, because no request to obtain it was received.
[02:44:52.144 --> 02:44:57.752]  Both police and prosecutors never requested the footage, baffling experts and law enforcement sources.
[02:44:58.072 --> 02:45:02.953]  And the latest information only adds to the scandal surrounding the event, reports Remix News.
[02:45:03.033 --> 02:45:06.334]  Wrongly, we may not have known that many people had experienced hail.
[02:45:06.354 --> 02:45:09.215]  We were not aware that these videos showed very serious things.
[02:45:09.315 --> 02:45:11.955]  No one told us about it, claimed one police source.
[02:45:12.015 --> 02:45:19.317]  The stadium features cameras at every entrance and on the grounds of the stadium, which likely means hundreds of hours of valuable footage has been lost.
[02:45:19.497 --> 02:45:25.942]  Camera footage from French public transport operator RATP was also deleted after 72 hours.
[02:45:26.002 --> 02:45:29.364]  For the same reason that authorities didn't ask for it to be saved.
[02:45:29.484 --> 02:45:36.569]  In any modern investigation, one of the first steps investigators take is to secure video footage even for minor crimes.
[02:45:36.669 --> 02:45:47.417]  The fact that courts and police forgot to request footage featuring one of the biggest riots at one of the world's biggest sporting events is perplexing and lacks credibility according to sources close to the case.
[02:45:47.517 --> 02:45:53.981]  There hasn't been a surveillance camera cock-up this disastrous since Diana and Dodi Fayed entered the Pond de l'Alma tunnel.
[02:45:54.082 --> 02:45:54.882]  If you know, you know.
[02:45:55.022 --> 02:46:05.249]  Lest we forget, according to victims and eyewitness reports, the bedlam was largely the work of migrant youths from the Saint-Denis area, which is home to 400,000 illegal immigrants.
[02:46:05.409 --> 02:46:17.138]   Apparently, in their continued effort to pretend that such no-go zones don't exist, the authorities conveniently forgot to secure the evidence that would have proved they're a massive and growing problem, and that maybe, Just maybe.
[02:46:17.318 --> 02:46:19.060]  Diversity isn't always a strength.
[02:46:19.141 --> 02:46:25.068]  A poll found that 76% of French people didn't believe the official explanation behind the riots.
[02:46:25.128 --> 02:46:28.472]  Which was to blame Liverpool fans who were actually the victims.
[02:46:28.532 --> 02:46:28.733]  Yeah.
[02:46:28.833 --> 02:46:32.778]  Good luck rebuilding that trust when you've allowed all the footage to be lost.
[02:46:35.253 --> 02:46:38.014]  There you have it, there's a few minutes left, so we'll switch gears.
[02:46:38.334 --> 02:46:41.076]  This headline went up on summit.news about two hours ago.
[02:46:41.196 --> 02:46:47.539]  Doctor criticised over tweets showing his baby wearing face mask filtration device on pram.
[02:46:48.099 --> 02:47:01.225]  Yes, the Covid cultists, despite the fact that, to all intents and purposes, the pandemic appears to be coming to an end, unless they bring it back in winter, which they probably will, still zealous in their beliefs.
[02:47:01.605 --> 02:47:10.792]   There's a paediatrician on Twitter And I expect him to lock down his account or disappear entirely at some point, which is why I saved screenshots of these tweets.
[02:47:11.712 --> 02:47:15.854]  This is Dr. Greg Kelly, who is based in Australia, an ICU specialist.
[02:47:16.294 --> 02:47:19.555]  Again, a COVID cultist, he wants all the restrictions to return.
[02:47:20.194 --> 02:47:33.986]  He's openly bragging on Twitter about how he puts his baby in a face mask, but the baby doesn't want to wear a face mask, keeps pulling it off, keeps sucking on the mask from the inside, rendering it useless.
[02:47:34.587 --> 02:47:54.226]   He's then posted another tweet, as you see right there, where he's got some kind of air filter, airtight seal, with some contraption attached to it over his pram, his baby's pram, So the baby doesn't breathe any fresh air because, God forbid, it might contain the deadly COVID.
[02:47:55.107 --> 02:48:06.151]  Of course, the actual number of children who have been killed by COVID over the past two years is lower than the number of children who have been killed by falling over from putting their pants on.
[02:48:07.011 --> 02:48:16.935]  But he's decided not only to mask, smother his baby in face masks at every available opportunity, but brag about it on Twitter like it's a great thing!
[02:48:17.950 --> 02:48:19.371]  Small problem with that.
[02:48:19.991 --> 02:48:39.484]  Speech therapists are now reporting that there's a 350 plus percent increase in referrals of babies and toddlers with cognitive learning disorders because either they're wearing masks or, more specifically, adults have been wearing masks on and off for the past two years.
[02:48:40.831 --> 02:48:49.914]  We also had a study out of Brown University which found that mean IQ scores of young children born during the pandemic have tumbled by as much as 22 points.
[02:48:50.975 --> 02:49:03.999]  We have a study out of Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists which found that, quote, repeated lockdowns had left young children without the chance to play and learn how to communicate, setting back their development.
[02:49:04.423 --> 02:49:13.689]  You have children, as we highlighted earlier in the week with another study, being unable to say their own name when they enter elementary school.
[02:49:13.929 --> 02:49:30.079]  They can't even talk because of social isolation caused by lockdown, because of cognitive learning development disorders, delays in their verbal communication learning, and of course masks, adults wearing masks, of course kids learn how to speak.
[02:49:30.584 --> 02:49:35.463]   via facial expressions from their parents, from other people, from other kids.
[02:49:35.463 --> 02:49:43.064]   It's all contributed to an absolute disaster in terms of young children being held back in their education.
[02:49:43.064 --> 02:49:46.423]  An impact that could last, as we know, for a lifetime.
[02:49:46.423 --> 02:49:54.904]   We've got speech therapists reporting a 350 plus percent increase in children exhibiting signs of autism
[02:49:54.904 --> 02:49:59.623]   at a very early age because of the lockdowns, because of the face masks.
[02:49:59.623 --> 02:50:08.413]   And this quack doctor is all over Twitter bragging about smothering his six-month-old baby in one of them like it's a good
[02:50:08.413 --> 02:50:08.904]  thing.
[02:50:09.183 --> 02:50:11.205]  Absolutely ludicrous!
[02:50:11.755 --> 02:50:13.376]  Summit.News is done.
[02:50:13.537 --> 02:50:14.918]  We'll be back with War Room.
[02:50:15.058 --> 02:50:15.839]  Don't go away.
[02:50:15.859 --> 02:50:17.240]  This is an attack on the world economy.
[02:50:17.600 --> 02:50:21.143]  That's the prime result we get out of this.
[02:50:21.163 --> 02:50:25.497]   We're going to face Economic problems that come from this and uncertainty.
[02:50:25.517 --> 02:50:27.258]  We're going to face military crises.
[02:50:27.298 --> 02:50:29.980]  We're going to face cultural and spiritual crises.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:37.364]  And we're going to see the UN further throw third world populations at borders of the West and attempt to break the West.
[02:50:37.885 --> 02:50:39.966]  Suddenly, the world's going bankrupt.
[02:50:40.026 --> 02:50:41.467]  Suddenly, your savings are gone.
[02:50:41.667 --> 02:50:47.330]  The New World Order elite types are going to try to trigger a financial collapse.
[02:50:48.171 --> 02:50:50.072]  This is the mass culling.
[02:50:50.312 --> 02:50:52.674]  When the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[02:50:53.672 --> 02:51:16.518]  I could play you clip after clip for hours of going back 30 months ago, and 20 months ago, and 10 months ago, and a month ago, where I told you there'd be hyperinflation, I told you there'd be food shortages, I told you the price of food would explode, because it's an IMF, World Bank, globalist plan they've already carried out for decades in third world countries, and now they're doing it.
[02:51:17.056 --> 02:51:20.761]  A dire new report forces US UK to change course on coronavirus strategy.
[02:51:21.081 --> 02:51:23.224]  Now you're going to be locked up for 18 months.
[02:51:23.904 --> 02:51:23.984]  Oh!
[02:51:25.356 --> 02:51:27.956]  That's gonna cause a depression within a month of this crap.
[02:51:28.337 --> 02:51:29.177]  But that's okay.
[02:51:29.517 --> 02:51:34.178]  Now the depression isn't the banker's fault or the politicians, it's all the virus.
[02:51:34.498 --> 02:51:37.358]  So now they can really screw you over.
[02:51:37.658 --> 02:51:48.280]  This has been the plan stated to cut off your carbon, to cut off your life, to cut off your mobility, to absolutely bring you down to below a third world status.
[02:51:48.620 --> 02:52:04.899]   And when you de-industrialize and you collapse the first world, just the estimates Put out by Russia and the United States, and Ward Monkton has his own, that if they did a 50% carbon cut like they wanted by 2025, they wanted the deal in place by 2008, didn't happen.
[02:52:07.534 --> 02:52:11.277]  That over a billion people would starve to death in the first decade.
[02:52:11.618 --> 02:52:15.241]  That's a b-b-b-b-b-b-billion!
[02:52:15.421 --> 02:52:24.449]  They've got a whole societal collapse program, how it brings down the hospitals and brings down the civilization, then there's a collapse, and then the general masses are starving to death.
[02:52:25.109 --> 02:52:34.336]  And so those that still have wealth that aren't part of the system are told, you've got to sign on and put your wealth into this to stabilize and save all these people that are dying and starving.
[02:52:34.937 --> 02:52:40.721]  And then basically you sign your wealth over to this big giant global wallet that they're going to be rolling out.
[02:52:41.222 --> 02:52:44.544]  And you and your whole family are in extreme danger of being murdered.
[02:52:45.085 --> 02:52:45.605]  Extreme danger.
[02:52:46.326 --> 02:52:49.538]   And It's not just from the virus they're going to release.
[02:52:50.219 --> 02:52:55.920]  It's from the collapse of civilization that's going to ensue that they're then going to organize to consolidate power.
[02:52:56.660 --> 02:53:14.025]  The only way to beat these people is to understand their game plan and to understand they've just started their inflationary system and to use the dollars you've got today to buy high quality storable food and other preparedness and survival items at low prices so that in the future you have what you need.
[02:53:14.325 --> 02:53:16.586]  That's how you beat these people.
