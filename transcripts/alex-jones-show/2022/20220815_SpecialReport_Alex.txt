[00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:11.812]  This is the parable of watch where you take your next step and don't take it for granted that there might always be level ground under your feet.
[00:00:12.952 --> 00:00:27.556]  I was walking along yesterday with my wife here in Omaha, Nebraska walking our French Bulldog and up ahead I saw a really cool mural of what looked like an eagle with a toucan's head on it.
[00:00:28.337 --> 00:00:32.726]   So I was looking ahead At that mural way down the street we're about to show you.
[00:00:33.247 --> 00:00:35.328]  And then something pretty interesting happened.
[00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.130]  But just look ahead of you.
[00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:40.152]  Does it look like any threat?
[00:00:41.613 --> 00:00:42.153]  On that street.
[00:00:42.253 --> 00:00:43.314]  Looks completely flat.
[00:00:43.354 --> 00:00:43.895]  Looks nice.
[00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:45.516]  Zoom in.
[00:00:46.597 --> 00:00:50.659]  You can see the mural I was talking about right there.
[00:00:52.581 --> 00:00:55.303]  But as you get closer, if you're actually watching around.
[00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:59.072]  This is something a little bit different.
[00:00:59.552 --> 00:01:01.213]  And this ties into so many things.
[00:01:01.873 --> 00:01:03.873]  Let's go ahead and start walking down there together.
[00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:13.873]  I see some people are looking at their phones.
[00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:15.581]  Some people are looking at the mural on the wall.
[00:01:16.722 --> 00:01:21.404]  But some people are looking at the ground.
[00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:25.927]  So I was walking along here looking at that eagle with a toucan head.
[00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:32.808]  And right when we got here, someone's already filled it up since yesterday, thank God.
[00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.171]  This hole, oh excuse me, I'm wrong.
[00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:45.595]  This hole was wide open and I stepped into it.
[00:01:46.735 --> 00:01:49.197]  It was about a foot deeper here, so it looks like they've dumped something in there.
[00:01:49.917 --> 00:01:55.120]  But imagine who was drilling these holes in the sidewalk and not thinking that somebody might step in it.
[00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:56.926]  And break their leg.
[00:01:56.966 --> 00:01:58.407]  We just saw that guy on his phone.
[00:01:58.827 --> 00:01:59.768]  He almost stepped in it.
[00:01:59.788 --> 00:02:01.448]  I was about to warn him.
[00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:03.489]  But he saw it and stepped around it.
[00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:08.091]  So I'm here looking at this.
[00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:13.994]  I guess Mexican Eagle is what you'd call it.
[00:02:15.115 --> 00:02:15.735]  Distracted.
[00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:19.597]  There's an even cooler part of the mural over here.
[00:02:23.398 --> 00:02:24.219]  It almost broke my leg.
[00:02:26.192 --> 00:02:31.055]  I blew my Tillys out eight years ago in Big Bend, stepping in a hole just like that, but that was in the dark.
[00:02:31.075 --> 00:02:31.695]  That was my fault.
[00:02:33.256 --> 00:02:34.457]  So what's the moral of the story?
[00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:46.685]  If I was a litigious person, I could sue the city of Omaha, Nebraska, where my wife's from, for a million dollars for drilling this recent hole.
[00:02:46.705 --> 00:02:50.527]  You can see the spray paint where they marked it and they're putting conduit in or something.
[00:02:50.627 --> 00:02:53.389]  Perfect to break your leg, but I'm not going to do it.
[00:02:55.009 --> 00:03:00.512]  But whoever was over this job, the city of Omaha, you need to fire whoever was in charge that let this happen.
[00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:02.192]  Now let me tell you what else happened yesterday.
[00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:07.393]   We went over and got a big pile of bricks which have now been removed
[00:03:07.393 --> 00:03:16.432]  and we went and piled them up around it.
[00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:17.819]  Someone's removed those bricks.
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.920]  They didn't bring them back over here.
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.162]  We grabbed a few of these bricks to put them around it.
[00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.831]  So that people would see it when they're walking.
[00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:29.752]  They would think, oh, what's that?
[00:03:30.953 --> 00:03:31.933]  And someone removed those.
[00:03:33.154 --> 00:03:41.440]  So since we were here yesterday, when this happened, we put bricks all around it, someone's removed those bricks, but doesn't think this is a problem.
[00:03:43.621 --> 00:03:46.023]  And again, this morning we had breakfast.
[00:03:47.784 --> 00:03:49.785]  Again, this morning we had breakfast and walked over here.
[00:03:51.286 --> 00:04:00.428]   And just as we were here yesterday, Someone's removed the bricks and we saw a man walking with a cell phone almost step into it, but he went around it at the last minute.
[00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:03.208]  So that's what we're talking about here.
[00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:19.252]  Now, there's a lot of examples of this, but just a few weeks ago when I was leaving trial in the kangaroo court in Austin, I saw an old man with what would look like his wife on the side of the road holding his chest.
[00:04:19.332 --> 00:04:21.573]  So I told my security guys, pull over, let's help him.
[00:04:22.642 --> 00:04:26.164]  And I didn't put that video out because people would say, oh, you're being opportunistic, showing you're a hero.
[00:04:26.484 --> 00:04:30.407]  It's not heroic when you see somebody having a heart attack, and indeed he was having heart problems.
[00:04:30.427 --> 00:04:32.628]  He has a heart condition, to get out of your car and help.
[00:04:32.648 --> 00:04:34.309]  I would expect somebody to help me.
[00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.131]  So see, that's the opposite of being litigious.
[00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:39.052]  That's just caring about people and getting involved.
[00:04:39.072 --> 00:04:42.234]  But more and more, you see reports where somebody gets hit by a car on the road.
[00:04:43.795 --> 00:04:46.236]  And people just drive by and don't help him, especially in places like China.
[00:04:46.756 --> 00:04:48.796]  Or people see a woman being raped in the middle of the street.
[00:04:49.217 --> 00:04:49.817]  Nobody helps her.
[00:04:49.837 --> 00:04:50.577]  You see those reports.
[00:04:51.097 --> 00:04:54.858]  But this is an example of government completely breaking down.
[00:04:55.478 --> 00:04:59.540]  What low IQ person cuts this freshly cut hole?
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.320]  You can see it's fresh.
[00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:04.741]  And then doesn't fill it.
[00:05:05.601 --> 00:05:06.461]  They filled this one.
[00:05:10.323 --> 00:05:11.523]  But they didn't fill that one.
[00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:19.411]  Again, this is a microcosm of not just government refusing to fill potholes now.
[00:05:19.431 --> 00:05:26.394]  Now they make holes in the ground where anybody, a child, an old lady, you name it, could break their leg.
[00:05:27.314 --> 00:05:29.515]  And it sure hurt my already hurt Achilles when I stepped into that.
[00:05:29.535 --> 00:05:32.115]  And it's just very frustrating.
[00:05:32.836 --> 00:05:36.497]  And some of my crew were like, hey, you, we're not litigious, but you ought to soon make them stop doing that.
[00:05:36.737 --> 00:05:37.457]  That'll make them stop.
[00:05:38.017 --> 00:05:39.678]  We need to fire incompetent people.
[00:05:40.962 --> 00:05:42.803]  Somebody needs to get in trouble for this right here.
[00:05:43.923 --> 00:05:45.464]  Like, I saw this fella earlier walking by.
[00:05:45.484 --> 00:05:46.844]  You almost stepped in that hole, didn't you, brother?
[00:05:47.644 --> 00:05:47.944]  Hey, Ned.
[00:05:48.385 --> 00:05:49.065]  Hey, how you doing, man?
[00:05:49.585 --> 00:05:50.325]  I'm fine.
[00:05:50.605 --> 00:05:54.807]  I stepped in that yesterday, and I was about to warn you, but you were smart, and you stepped around it.
[00:05:55.447 --> 00:05:56.147]  I try to be smart.
[00:05:56.367 --> 00:05:58.228]  Are you Alex Jones?
[00:05:58.308 --> 00:05:58.948]  I am Alex Jones.
[00:05:58.968 --> 00:05:59.348]  How you doing?
[00:05:59.388 --> 00:05:59.648]  Very well.
[00:05:59.668 --> 00:05:59.988]  How are you?
[00:06:00.129 --> 00:06:01.389]  No, but I saw you down there.
[00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.810]  I'm like, we're walking down here shooting a report, because I almost broke my leg that yesterday.
[00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:06.431]  I was looking at the cool mural.
[00:06:06.951 --> 00:06:07.511]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:07.571 --> 00:06:08.751]  And I just stepped right in that hole.
[00:06:09.172 --> 00:06:09.832]  Can I get a picture?
[00:06:09.852 --> 00:06:10.192]  Sure, man.
[00:06:11.567 --> 00:06:12.910]  Sorry, I don't have my glasses on.
[00:06:17.378 --> 00:06:17.819]  So, so...
[00:06:19.366 --> 00:06:20.106]  You saw that, didn't you?
[00:06:20.166 --> 00:06:20.947]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:21.107 --> 00:06:21.967]  I kind of, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:22.127 --> 00:06:22.927]  Is this not insane?
[00:06:23.247 --> 00:06:24.048]  It's pretty insane, yeah.
[00:06:24.688 --> 00:06:25.308]  And it's brand new.
[00:06:25.348 --> 00:06:26.048]  What do you think of this?
[00:06:26.108 --> 00:06:27.669]  I mean, this is just, like, why would you do that?
[00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:28.429]  I don't know, man.
[00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:29.750]  That's kind of interesting.
[00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.950]  Looks like maybe they're fixing it.
[00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:32.571]  Well, they are doing a lot of construction here.
[00:06:32.611 --> 00:06:35.552]  No, I know, but I mean, anybody knows a hole in the sidewalk is not good.
[00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:36.192]  It's true.
[00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:36.832]  Like, check this out.
[00:06:36.872 --> 00:06:37.653]  They filled this one.
[00:06:37.873 --> 00:06:38.073]  Yeah.
[00:06:38.813 --> 00:06:41.254]  And then I guess they thought, well, we're not going to be worried about this one over here.
[00:06:41.274 --> 00:06:42.054]  It ran out of gravel, man.
[00:06:42.254 --> 00:06:42.454]  Yeah.
[00:06:42.975 --> 00:06:43.995]  Well, God bless you, man.
[00:06:44.155 --> 00:06:44.755]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:44.775 --> 00:06:45.356]  Take care.
[00:06:45.476 --> 00:06:45.796]  Take care.
[00:06:46.856 --> 00:06:48.477]  So anyways, that was the guy I saw almost up in the hole.
[00:06:49.238 --> 00:06:50.419]  So, this is a real story.
[00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.161]  I mean, I can show you my Achilles.
[00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:54.962]  Here, let me show people this.
[00:06:55.362 --> 00:06:57.484]  Again, I was in Big Ben eight years ago.
[00:06:57.524 --> 00:06:58.224]  I never got it fixed.
[00:06:58.244 --> 00:07:01.526]  See the tear in it right there?
[00:07:03.247 --> 00:07:04.068]  See how there's no Achilles?
[00:07:04.288 --> 00:07:04.829]  They're almost done.
[00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:06.750]  That's a torn Achilles.
[00:07:07.951 --> 00:07:09.152]  You see over here, I got an Achilles.
[00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:13.775]  That's normal Achilles.
[00:07:16.121 --> 00:07:23.728]  There was a hole just like that that somebody had put in the parking lot, off the edge of the parking lot, in Big Bend National Park, and I stepped in it.
[00:07:23.868 --> 00:07:24.629]  And again, I'm not whining.
[00:07:24.649 --> 00:07:25.830]  This is not about me stepping in a hole.
[00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.853]  This is about realizing this is a metaphor for society.
[00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:31.275]  Open borders, letting them ship fentanyl in.
[00:07:31.915 --> 00:07:37.500]  When we don't care about our fellow humans, we don't deal with stuff like this, it's going to cause a problem.
[00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:41.244]  So, I want to know who came and took the bricks away.
[00:07:42.355 --> 00:07:44.276]  I want to know why this is going on.
[00:07:44.316 --> 00:07:48.137]  I guarantee you, once this goes on air, the city of Omaha is going to do something.
[00:07:48.318 --> 00:07:50.979]  I feel bad even leaving this open.
[00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:53.460]  I'm sure whoever's bricks are on the side of that building, they're willing to volunteer them.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:59.062]  I'm going to go ahead and just fill this hole up.
[00:08:02.103 --> 00:08:03.424]  That guy almost stepped in the hole.
[00:08:03.444 --> 00:08:06.245]  He said, well, he kind of saw it.
[00:08:06.064 --> 00:08:10.064]  Maybe he just stepped around it magically or something.
[00:08:10.064 --> 00:08:11.064]  But...
[00:08:11.064 --> 00:08:28.064]  It would take too many breaks to fill this one.
[00:08:28.096 --> 00:08:28.797]  I don't have enough anymore.
[00:08:28.817 --> 00:08:36.542]  Alright, so that's the parable of the hole drilled in the sidewalk.
[00:08:37.343 --> 00:08:41.465]  The parable of the what the hell is happening to society that someone would walk off and leave that.
[00:08:41.806 --> 00:08:46.129]  Why would they fill that, but not fill that?
[00:08:47.293 --> 00:08:49.295]  That, my friends, is the big question.
[00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:50.236]  InfoWars.com.
[00:08:50.256 --> 00:08:59.966]  Tomorrow's the news today.
[00:08:59.885 --> 00:09:05.885]  [Music]
[00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:09.885]  I've known this guy probably 20 years.
[00:09:09.885 --> 00:09:13.885]   They've had the most courage out there to publish books that nobody else will publish
[00:09:13.885 --> 00:09:19.334]   and they've become one of the most successful publishing houses in North America, if not the world, that Skyhorse
[00:09:19.334 --> 00:09:19.885]  Publishing has.
[00:09:19.529 --> 00:09:28.057]  And I just want to salute Tony Lyons because this guy is fearless, and I gotta say it, the credit goes to Tony Lyons and his researchers that we're going to mention here.
[00:09:28.257 --> 00:09:31.678]  It's not ghostwritten, it's my recordings, it's my words, it's my clips.
[00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:34.220]  I sent them, but he had lawyers involved, you name it.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.260]  They took it next level.
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.581]  This is how they're doing it, and how to stop them.
[00:09:37.721 --> 00:09:39.602]  I am just, thank you so much, Tony.
[00:09:39.862 --> 00:09:47.585]  How the hell with your team, because you took my recordings, and 20 hours of recordings, and all the stuff I sent you, and all the meetings we had, and you did this.
[00:09:47.645 --> 00:09:48.285]  This is incredible.
[00:09:48.325 --> 00:09:51.967]  You know, this is the most controversial book coming out this year.
[00:09:52.127 --> 00:09:54.708]  There's no question, the most controversial book.
[00:09:54.928 --> 00:09:56.449]  They're going to try to shut it down.
[00:09:56.969 --> 00:09:58.730]  They don't want you to read this book.
[00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.191]  They're afraid of the revelations in this book.
[00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:04.132]  And they're going to censor it in every conceivable way.
[00:10:04.652 --> 00:10:12.876]  So, the thing to do now is to buy it right now, push it to the top of the list, so that everybody has to carry it.
[00:10:13.216 --> 00:10:25.841]  That they know that this book is there, that it's not going to go away, that you're not going to go away, that you're a patriot, that you're fighting for what's right, and that we don't deserve censorship in this country.
[00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:32.624]  We have fought and died for freedom in this country, and we need to fight to protect freedom in this country.
[00:10:32.944 --> 00:10:34.425]  And that's what your book is about.
[00:10:34.545 --> 00:10:36.866]  It's about combating the Great Reset.
[00:10:37.226 --> 00:10:39.147]  This is a book that people need to read.
[00:10:39.588 --> 00:10:44.370]  If they disagree with it, if people disagree with it, they should make an argument against it.
[00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.631]  They shouldn't censor it.
[00:10:45.931 --> 00:10:47.391]  They shouldn't de-platform it.
[00:10:47.672 --> 00:10:49.773]  They shouldn't write hit pieces against you.
[00:10:50.153 --> 00:10:56.233]   They should buy The Great Reset and The War for the World by Alex Jones, and they should
[00:10:56.233 --> 00:11:00.912]   decide for themselves, people should decide for themselves what they believe.
[00:11:00.912 --> 00:11:04.312]   And if they have better arguments, they should make those arguments.
[00:11:04.312 --> 00:11:07.991]  But this is an important book, and I highly recommend it.
[00:11:07.991 --> 00:11:12.273]   And you know, buying it is an act of rebellion, because like I said, they're going to try
[00:11:12.273 --> 00:11:15.072]  to shut it down in every conceivable way.
[00:11:15.183 --> 00:11:22.565]  This is a book that's already got great blurbs by, you know, Tucker Carlson, Mike Adams, Dr. Mercola, lots of people.
[00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:24.345]  I mean, this is an important book.
[00:11:24.465 --> 00:11:32.867]  You know, it's a book that people have to read and think through, and they have to realize that it's not going to be covered in any mainstream newspaper.
[00:11:33.007 --> 00:11:36.148]  It might not be available in, you know, libraries.
[00:11:36.288 --> 00:11:38.429]  Yeah, Tucker Carlson gave it a great quote.
[00:11:38.469 --> 00:11:39.129]  I mean, it's awesome.
[00:11:39.229 --> 00:11:45.673]  Tucker Carlson, you know, said, why are the most powerful people in the country trying to silence Alex Jones?
[00:11:45.873 --> 00:11:47.974]  Read this book and decide for yourself.
[00:11:48.154 --> 00:11:49.435]  So that's the thing.
[00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:50.336]  Read this book.
[00:11:50.515 --> 00:11:56.635]   Read The Great Reset and decide for yourself whether the things that you, Alex Jones, have
[00:11:56.635 --> 00:12:02.274]   described are really happening and whether we can all get together to fight them, to
[00:12:02.274 --> 00:12:03.315]  fight for freedom.
[00:12:03.315 --> 00:12:05.194]  So this is like a battle cry.
[00:12:05.194 --> 00:12:09.275]   This is a book that people need to read and they need to recognize that a lot of people
[00:12:09.275 --> 00:12:12.956]   are going to come out with hit pieces, with reasons not to read it.
[00:12:12.956 --> 00:12:15.714]  They're going to not address any of the claims in the book.
[00:12:16.061 --> 00:12:18.482]  They're just going to go after you personally, Alex.
[00:12:18.542 --> 00:12:19.682]  They might come after me.
[00:12:19.962 --> 00:12:32.508]  But, you know, the reason that we publish books and the reason that people should read books is to learn something new, is to get out of your own kind of footprints and look at things and really think them through for yourself.
[00:12:32.588 --> 00:12:36.490]  Tony, all I can say is congratulations and gosh, I'm glad I finally...
[00:12:36.510 --> 00:12:38.031]  Because I had a lot of other book deals I turned down.
[00:12:38.091 --> 00:12:42.773]  Thank God I went with you because what you did, what we did together is simply groundbreaking.
[00:12:42.893 --> 00:12:45.895]  And I believe if people get behind it, it'll go to number one.
[00:12:46.195 --> 00:12:47.556]  And culturally, that's so important.
