[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:06.611]  Whether you believe the globalists are going to be successful or not in creating the system they say they're building and they are building it.
[00:00:07.832 --> 00:00:20.436]  It's so central to understand that it's a nightmare authoritarian world where full control is taken over human development and human evolution in their words to not empower humanity.
[00:00:21.236 --> 00:00:30.161]  But to depopulate the vast majority of us and on its ashes build their world government, technocracy, where they believe they're going to be gods.
[00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:34.264]  They have decided to bring down civilization as we know it.
[00:00:34.984 --> 00:00:43.750]  And the adherents, the cult members that join this system and go along with it, believe they're about to be given everlasting artificial life and be gods.
[00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:52.769]   Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a psychotic cult of transhumanists is setting up a planetary world
[00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.549]   government and their holy grail is life extension technology.
[00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:07.549]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.549]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:28.549]  [Music]
[00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:31.549]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.549]  It's Wednesday, October 26th.
[00:01:35.177 --> 00:01:37.760]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:51.113]  And I'm about to play in the next segment a clip of Yuval Noah Harari, the high priest of the World Economic Forum, that's what they call him, laying out their ultimate in-game secret.
[00:01:52.054 --> 00:02:17.830]   They are engineering the artificial collapse of human civilization and the quote elites as he calls himself and the other globalists are going to extract the technological know-how and resources of the human earth while they cut it off from us to build undersea underground and space-based Redoubts that will protect them from the organized collapse of civilization.
[00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.312]  And that's what the COVID release was, was a beta test of far more deadly bioweapons they're planning to release.
[00:02:24.953 --> 00:02:32.916]  Remember, Ian Fleming was number two in the OSS and very high level in MI6 after World War II.
[00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:35.517]  And he wrote the James Bond books.
[00:02:36.117 --> 00:02:38.118]  And one of them was Moon Raker.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.641]  Before we even go into space.
[00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:48.324]  And in it he described a group of mad scientists that want depopulation, building a space station they can go to.
[00:02:48.344 --> 00:02:59.530]  While on Earth a deadly bioweapon is released that will kill all life on Earth, they can then return with all the best genetic specimens, and the Earth will be basically like a national park for them.
[00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.531]  We've now seen statements like this out of Jeff Bezos.
[00:03:04.311 --> 00:03:14.755]  We've now seen statements like this out of basically all of the globalists except Elon Musk, who says he wants a pro-human future, and he's actually more and more moving towards our direction of standing against it.
[00:03:15.255 --> 00:03:19.477]  I don't know if he's hedging his bets, but regardless, he's saying and doing the right things.
[00:03:19.517 --> 00:03:26.301]   But all of them, from Bill Gates to Klaus Schwab, Tim Cook are espousing this.
[00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:29.364]  This is their transhumanist religion.
[00:03:29.444 --> 00:03:39.375]  So when we come back from break, we are going to play the latest clip of Yuval Noah Harari spilling his guts to the world and admitting the plan.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.940]  And it's not just what Harari's saying.
[00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:58.125]  All the major globalist publications and television programs, both fiction and non-fiction, promote a world without humans and how great it's going to be and how we're bad for the planet and how this cataclysm is coming sometime after 2030 and our population's got to be reduced.
[00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:15.113]  So what they're doing is corralling us, locking us down, taking away our resources, turning us against each other, while they build what they believe, an accelerated path of evolution to merge with cybernetic systems and genetic engineering systems to become, quote, gods.
[00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:20.235]  You've all heard Harari make similar statements to that, where he actually says, we are going to be gods.
[00:04:20.695 --> 00:04:26.058]  Ray Kurzweil, the head futurist at Google, says, I don't believe in God yet, but I'm going to become a god.
[00:04:26.638 --> 00:04:49.002]  But for them to become a god, they must play god and artificially create a cascade of cataclysms or Armageddons that lead to this planetary crisis out of which they build their breakaway civilization or their Noah's arks, not ark, arks to separate themselves from humanity.
[00:04:49.042 --> 00:04:53.324]   They believe it is their evolutionary job to call us And they carry this out.
[00:04:53.764 --> 00:05:13.357]  And that if we're too stupid when they publicly admit their plans to speak out against them and to resist them and to build a different cosmology for a different future, if we don't lay out other ideas and other destinies for people to get behind, we then cede the entire brain trust and future to these monsters.
[00:05:14.037 --> 00:05:16.659]  This could not be a more important issue.
[00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:19.642]  This is the central issue of the elite capture.
[00:05:20.042 --> 00:05:22.544]  Yes, the megacorporations of the world are allied with Communist China.
[00:05:22.964 --> 00:05:24.125]  Yes, they control the media.
[00:05:24.445 --> 00:05:26.387]  Yes, they control most academia and the banks.
[00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:37.856]  And yes, they are selling us that we deserve to die and that this is just part of a foregone conclusion, a self-fulfilling prophecy that for them to transcend, we must die.
[00:05:38.596 --> 00:05:44.720]  They are self-appointed, doing what Hitler did, but on a much wider, more complex scale.
[00:05:45.301 --> 00:05:46.502]  And that's why they're dividing us.
[00:05:46.522 --> 00:05:47.562]  That's why they're poisoning us.
[00:05:47.582 --> 00:05:48.723]  That's why they're dumbing us down.
[00:05:49.164 --> 00:05:56.449]  That's why they're trying to destroy all the educational systems, turn us into a bunch of mindless idiots, so that we don't contend for them for the future.
[00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.311]  This is a war for the future, a war for the world.
[00:05:59.651 --> 00:06:00.732]  A war for the species.
[00:06:00.772 --> 00:06:01.912]  We are at the crossroads.
[00:06:02.332 --> 00:06:04.974]  Thank you for joining us on this live Wednesday broadcast.
[00:06:05.234 --> 00:06:05.894]  We're going to go to break.
[00:06:05.914 --> 00:06:08.835]  I'm going to come back and lay all of this critical information out.
[00:06:09.476 --> 00:06:11.277]  Nothing is more important than this information.
[00:06:11.297 --> 00:06:11.697]  Stay with us.
[00:06:13.738 --> 00:06:15.519]  It's Wednesday, October 26, 2022.
[00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:24.843]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I'm about to lay out the most important information on this planet.
[00:06:25.845 --> 00:06:35.393]  Without a doubt, this is the most central, critical information facing not just our species, but all life on this planet.
[00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:58.458]  The globalists are transhumanist technocrats who believe they are forcing an accelerated evolution of humanity into a new ubermenschen or super species that is a hybridized homo sapien sapien merged with new biotech and cybernetic forms of life.
[00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:14.043]  And they believe they are the guardians of this planet and to step into that position, they need to play God and need to carry out the forced depopulation of at least 90% of Earth.
[00:07:14.783 --> 00:07:22.406]  Now, I've been talking about this for 28 years on air because I've been reading their own reports, their own books, their own white papers, and watching their speeches on C-SPAN.
[00:07:23.286 --> 00:07:29.833]  And now we've gone from this being a very esoteric thing decades ago to being out in the open because they're going from...
[00:07:31.485 --> 00:07:35.466]  Testing phase or beta phase into operational phase.
[00:07:36.146 --> 00:07:46.709]  And we played a lot of clips here on air of the high priest of the World Economic Forum, a medieval studies professor, Yuval Noah Harari, who did not come up with any of these ideas himself.
[00:07:47.089 --> 00:08:00.272]  They're actually the ideas of Julian Huxley and others that first founded the transhumanist movement after World War II, changing the name from the World Eugenics Society to the World Transhumanist Society to forcibly take control of what they believe is human evolution.
[00:08:01.232 --> 00:08:05.193]  And again, merge humans with advanced biotech and machines.
[00:08:05.273 --> 00:08:17.658]  But before that process can be carried out, they have to step into the evolutionary position of God, in their words, and direct the direction of human development.
[00:08:18.318 --> 00:08:25.941]  There's a new clip of Noah Eval Harari that we're about to play in a moment, where he explains the big secret of secrets.
[00:08:26.761 --> 00:08:28.242]  The general public's not going to make it.
[00:08:28.602 --> 00:08:44.327]  The general public's going to be destroyed in a cataclysm, in a flood-like event that they're going to orchestrate and implement, and that the elites will then steal all the technological development and ideas of humanity to build their escape ship off of the Earth.
[00:08:45.027 --> 00:09:21.172]   Now, national media in the last 20 years has made a lot of fun of me when I explained that interdimensional off-world influence, the Bible tells us is Satan, is manipulating humans here on the planet to build a escape system to get off the planet in which this interdimensional entity is trapped in a vortex and that we are actually more advanced than this fallen species that's more robotic the way it's described in the Bible and that it is again seeking to manipulate us into building this new system
[00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.231]  That it can then escape with.
[00:09:24.932 --> 00:09:32.779]  Now again, this sounds completely fantastical and wild, but you'll notice now in a moment that Yuval Harari says exactly that.
[00:09:32.819 --> 00:09:40.173]   That the elites are going to break away from humanity, become a new species and escape In a new Noah's Ark from humanity.
[00:09:40.953 --> 00:09:45.895]  The reason I've been laying this out for years is studying their documents, their reports.
[00:09:46.315 --> 00:09:48.376]  This is actually what they believe.
[00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:53.498]  That's why we've seen Elon Musk begin to break with these globalists.
[00:09:54.298 --> 00:10:05.206]  And openly say, beware those that worship AI gods and those that believe they're going to become AI gods, because they've made the decision that you don't deserve to go into the future.
[00:10:05.566 --> 00:10:12.711]  And they've made the decision that they're going to direct every facet of not just human life, but all life on this planet.
[00:10:13.331 --> 00:10:18.375]  Here is the short 56 second clip of Harari laying out their plan.
[00:10:19.088 --> 00:10:29.233]  You have a small elite that pushes things in its own interests, even if it doesn't benefit the vast majority of the population.
[00:10:29.693 --> 00:10:34.755]  This has happened so many times previously in history, and it's probably going to happen again.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:48.603]  One of the biggest dangers to the planet today is this technological utopia, because probably for the elite it will work.
[00:10:49.483 --> 00:10:59.567]   If bad comes to worse, when the flood comes, The scientists will build a Noah's Ark for the elite, leaving the rest to drown.
[00:10:59.827 --> 00:11:02.649]  The rest of the people and the rest of the ecosystem.
[00:11:03.249 --> 00:11:11.073]  But they are likely to be able to construct this technological Noah's Ark, which is probably what much of the elite is counting on.
[00:11:11.833 --> 00:11:15.136]  There are countless other clips we've played of Harari that I would remind you of.
[00:11:15.756 --> 00:11:24.723]  Just a few months ago, he said he doesn't believe in God, but that we're going to become gods, similar to what Ray Kurzweil and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and others have said.
[00:11:24.803 --> 00:11:26.624]  This is their transhumanist cult.
[00:11:27.004 --> 00:11:30.907]  This is their get-out-of-jail-free-card-live-forever system.
[00:11:30.967 --> 00:11:31.588]  This is their ethos.
[00:11:31.848 --> 00:11:32.729]  This is their religion.
[00:11:36.158 --> 00:11:47.829]  And when you study the Bible, and you study other ancient texts from Mesopotamia and other areas of the world, it's the same story repeated over and over and over again.
[00:11:47.869 --> 00:12:00.481]  That's why in the movie Prometheus, in the prequel to the Aliens series, you see the same Anunnaki line coming to Earth, creating humans, and then deciding to come back and destroy us.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:05.201]   When in the Bible it says that God, who also created the Anunnaki and us,
[00:12:05.201 --> 00:12:08.799]   decided to destroy the Anunnaki and most of the humans on Earth
[00:12:08.799 --> 00:12:11.680]  because they were manipulating the genetics of humans.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.280]   Now you can say, "Well, that's just a book," or, "That was written in ancient times.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.439]   Who knows if the Sumerians or the Israelites or before them the Jews were correct?"
[00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:24.240]   But regardless, the globalists are manifesting everything that's in the Bible
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.079]   and everything that's in the Sumerian text and everything that's in the Vedic text
[00:12:28.079 --> 00:12:30.160]  that are over 3,000 years old from India.
[00:12:30.314 --> 00:12:31.415]  It's all the same story.
[00:12:32.075 --> 00:12:33.036]  They believe it.
[00:12:33.297 --> 00:12:33.817]  They know it.
[00:12:33.857 --> 00:12:49.319]   That's why Revelation, written by John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos 2,000 years ago, is being followed exactly with a world government, three global regions, ten sub-regions, a mark in the forehead and hand to buy and sell.
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:13:06.567]   Everything in there describes how everyone on earth will be able to watch the beast when it communicates to them and gives the public orders and engages in signs and wonders and cures the sick and ends war and brings in global peace, but only For a very, very short time.
[00:13:06.587 --> 00:13:12.971]  And that is the AI system of the beast system that serves the Antichrist.
[00:13:14.332 --> 00:13:19.256]  So pull back and look at Yuval Noah Harari and all of his different statements.
[00:13:20.819 --> 00:13:26.583]  And if you put them together and read his books and watch his speeches, it's everything the Bible says.
[00:13:27.144 --> 00:13:28.085]  He even quotes the Bible.
[00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:39.413]  But he's put himself and the other globalists in the place of God, who are building this technological Noah's Ark, or breakaway civilization, to separate themselves from us.
[00:13:39.934 --> 00:13:59.068]   While they teach us we're failed, while they teach us that we've got to die to save the Earth, while they go after our life force, our self-preservation instinct, so that we will stand down Not create our own dreams, our own ideas, and hand total control of these monsters to the future development of our species.
[00:14:00.427 --> 00:14:22.882]  They know there have been previous cataclysms on this planet and now they're trying to artificially create a cascade of cataclysms where they position themselves as God and basically manipulate humanity into the idea that we deserve to be destroyed and starved to death and hit with radiologicals and 5G and bio-weapons because we are bad for the Earth.
[00:14:23.242 --> 00:14:27.705]  That the viruses don't come out of labs, they come out of the jungles because of global warming.
[00:14:28.206 --> 00:14:35.166]   These people are self-appointed globalist control freaks hell-bent and completely dedicated
[00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:39.255]   to ensuring that none of us are able to make decisions about the future
[00:14:39.255 --> 00:14:43.116]   development of our species when we come back I'm gonna lay out the ways we can
[00:14:43.116 --> 00:14:47.045]   expose these people and stop them
[00:14:47.926 --> 00:15:04.885]   1984 is 1776 InfoWars has been banned
[00:15:05.407 --> 00:15:05.767]  Arrested.
[00:15:05.887 --> 00:15:12.251]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:15:12.291 --> 00:15:13.532]  Because we are effective.
[00:15:13.572 --> 00:15:16.914]  The Great Awakening is here.

[00:15:32.767 --> 00:15:41.767]  [Music]
[00:15:41.767 --> 00:15:48.767]   InfoWars.com Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for joining us on
[00:15:48.767 --> 00:15:51.767]  this live Wednesday broadcast.
[00:15:51.824 --> 00:16:01.253]  Owen Schroyer and a ton of news and analysis is coming up here in the next segment, but I wanted to continue with the most important issue in the world.
[00:16:01.473 --> 00:16:02.995]  This is a spiritual battle.
[00:16:03.455 --> 00:16:05.237]  There is good and evil in the universe.
[00:16:05.777 --> 00:16:07.419]  Humans are made in the image of God.
[00:16:07.819 --> 00:16:11.843]  Whatever we envision, give it enough time and energy, we're able to build.
[00:16:12.683 --> 00:16:15.406]  Think how far humans have come in the last six, seven thousand years.
[00:16:15.446 --> 00:16:16.987]  Think about how far we can go.
[00:16:17.848 --> 00:16:19.069]  And the globalists know this.
[00:16:19.769 --> 00:16:45.723]   And they're in a race to control the future and create a new dark age for the general public or a Hunger Games type scenario where a massively depopulated group of serfs Live basically in subsistence level dark age farming systems for the controllers and the controllers live in high tech compact cities and then build off world space bases and more.
[00:16:46.443 --> 00:16:49.904]  So they've decided to take control of human development.
[00:16:49.944 --> 00:17:09.909]  They've decided to try to steal the future from humanity, while at the same time selling us a cosmology and a self-fulfilling prophecy that we're bad and we're evil and we're ugly and we need to advocate our responsibility and our will and turn it over to sickening control freaks like Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and you've all Noah Harari.
[00:17:10.729 --> 00:17:13.730]  If you just joined us last segment, I played the clip.
[00:17:14.071 --> 00:17:32.419]  That's just one of hundreds where he openly declares that the elite is going to break away using the science and technology we have and the resources of humanity and build an Elysium field type or Moonraker type scenario where they are exempt from the hell they rain down on us.
[00:17:32.799 --> 00:17:44.502]   That we are simply here extracting resources from the earth to provide them with the science, the technology, and the know-how so they can escape their own system that they have helped develop.
[00:17:44.502 --> 00:17:54.902]   This, ladies and gentlemen, is a revelation, writ large, out in the open, for the whole world to see.
[00:17:54.902 --> 00:18:00.502]   Because what the mainline churches don't teach you, and what you don't see anywhere,
[00:18:00.502 --> 00:18:07.302]   but in the globalist-owned admissions, is what the Antichrist system is actually trying to build.
[00:18:07.877 --> 00:18:09.698]  They want to be God.
[00:18:10.219 --> 00:18:11.960]  They want to go interplanetary.
[00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:13.742]  They want to go interstellar.
[00:18:14.122 --> 00:18:15.503]  They want to go intergalactic.
[00:18:15.823 --> 00:18:24.089]  They want to go interdimensional with the CERN superconducting supercollider cyclotron with their fission fusion artificial suns and black holes they're creating.
[00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:34.254]   They're endangering the whole planet rolling the dice in the attempt to become gods. They've already set themselves up in the position of
[00:18:34.254 --> 00:18:40.334]   playing God to decide who lives and who dies. Think of what they've just done in
[00:18:40.334 --> 00:18:43.973]   the last three years. Cooking up a deadly virus, releasing the virus, then
[00:18:43.973 --> 00:18:48.223]   giving people deadly shots that create artificial nanotech clots in the
[00:18:48.223 --> 00:18:53.073]   body. Massive increase in death. Conservatively more than 10 million
[00:18:53.073 --> 00:18:57.953]   worldwide have died from the injections and they're just getting started. But
[00:18:57.953 --> 00:19:02.744]   because they see us as animals and because we act like animals, many of us that
[00:19:02.744 --> 00:19:07.073]   don't organize and fight back against them, they believe it is their right and
[00:19:07.073 --> 00:19:11.354]   their duty to carry this out because it is social Darwinism, survival of the
[00:19:11.354 --> 00:19:12.113]  fittest.
[00:19:12.438 --> 00:19:17.099]  They believe they're filling the predator role in culling the useless eaters.
[00:19:17.479 --> 00:19:18.760]  But the good news is this.
[00:19:20.094 --> 00:19:21.876]  They thought they'd still have us in lockdown.
[00:19:22.276 --> 00:19:24.418]  They thought they'd still be rolling out force injections.
[00:19:24.838 --> 00:19:26.119]  They thought the public would buckle.
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:33.926]  They thought their censorship would suppress those of us that were aware of what they were doing, and that they would be far, far further ahead than they are now.
[00:19:34.366 --> 00:19:46.596]   In fact, they've been fought to a standstill, a stalemate, and all over the world, from Sweden to Canada, To Australia, to Brazil, to the UK, to the US.
[00:19:46.796 --> 00:19:57.385]  Leaders are rising and getting elected that are breaking with the WEF, breaking with the globalist agenda, breaking with the Great Reset and saying no to it over and over again.
[00:19:57.785 --> 00:19:59.706]  Here's just one great example.
[00:20:00.207 --> 00:20:18.429]   The new Prime Minister The new Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, in Sweden came out, Ulf Kristiansen, and says they're getting rid of their environment ministry that works with the UN and the WEF, and they're ending all the restrictions on farming, on methane, on carbon, and everything else.
[00:20:18.809 --> 00:20:24.972]  And he came out and said it's all a fraud to control society and create serfs and slaves.
[00:20:25.632 --> 00:20:30.033]  Let me give you the name of the headline so you can find it from Armstrong Economics.
[00:20:30.573 --> 00:20:33.194]  Sweden will not meet Agenda 2030.
[00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:38.375]  And there are just so many countless examples of that just today.
[00:20:38.775 --> 00:20:41.576]  But I wanted to give you just one.
[00:20:42.256 --> 00:20:46.197]   My friends, our situation It's far from hopeless.
[00:20:46.538 --> 00:21:00.663]  They would need, as I say every day, to be censoring and attacking and suing and threatening and indicting patriot, pro-human, pro-God, pro-family, pro-Earth individuals if we were defeated.
[00:21:00.743 --> 00:21:02.444]  In fact, we are far from defeated.
[00:21:02.784 --> 00:21:10.707]  We are promoting truth and justice and prosperity and chivalry and honor and real human competition that makes us stronger.
[00:21:11.027 --> 00:21:15.168]  And makes us thrive so that the best of us can raise the rest of us up.
[00:21:15.588 --> 00:21:18.309]  The rising tide raises all ships.
[00:21:18.689 --> 00:21:45.068]   If you look at the evil, corrupt, degenerate Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and Yuval Noah Harari and the rest of them like Ray Kurzweil, they are degenerate, gross, ugly, sickening, parasitic individuals that have quite literally made a deal with the devil for what they believe will be artificial, Immortality in a matrix-like system they're building.
[00:21:45.388 --> 00:21:48.389]  That's their promise of artificial life.
[00:21:48.969 --> 00:21:53.691]  But everything, just like their shots, and just like all their other systems, is a fraud.
[00:21:53.831 --> 00:21:54.991]  It doesn't work.
[00:21:55.651 --> 00:21:56.411]  It's a scam.
[00:21:56.812 --> 00:22:02.113]  They're never going to give us access to the technology that our brain trust actually created.
[00:22:02.553 --> 00:22:13.535]   They will only give us access to poisoned, twisted systems that lower us And bring us closer to their spiritual wavelengths and remove us from God.
[00:22:13.855 --> 00:22:24.601]  Because if we're connected to God in the infinite, we will be given a blueprint, we will be given a resonance, we will be given a transmission by what the Bible calls the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:25.761 --> 00:22:32.726]  To be able to have discernment and transcend the enemy's plan and actually build God's plan here on Earth.
[00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:34.106]  Heaven on Earth.
[00:22:35.427 --> 00:22:36.548]  Revelation will be fulfilled.
[00:22:36.568 --> 00:22:37.649]  Daniel will be fulfilled.
[00:22:37.729 --> 00:22:38.889]  Ezekiel will be fulfilled.
[00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:40.610]  All of it will be fulfilled.
[00:22:41.371 --> 00:22:42.592]  The Antichrist will arise.
[00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:43.672]  We will have a technocracy.
[00:22:44.793 --> 00:22:46.456]  A large portion of the planet will be killed.
[00:22:47.197 --> 00:22:55.091]  Satan will then be bound and defeated for a thousand years and let loose yet again for a short time to test the faithful yet again.
[00:22:55.111 --> 00:23:14.054]   Then at that point, This entire dimension, we think of as the third dimension, that is not a simulation, but is an artificial creation of God for us to be able to be tested, will be rolled up from its four corners like a scroll, and will be disappeared into eternity.
[00:23:14.474 --> 00:23:17.635]  And we will go forward with God into infinity.
[00:23:18.076 --> 00:23:20.596]  Now, if that isn't heavy, I don't know what is.
[00:23:20.716 --> 00:23:22.037]  And the globalists know it's true.
[00:23:22.697 --> 00:23:29.742]  They're attempting to fill the void they see, and be God, and carry out and execute God's plan.
[00:23:29.782 --> 00:23:34.745]  Just as the Bible says, Satan is actually fulfilling God's plan, and Satan even knows it.
[00:23:35.125 --> 00:23:47.373]  Satan simply wants to take as many souls as he can with him, again, in a hope that someday, in some eon, into the infinity, they will somehow be able to break away.
[00:23:48.474 --> 00:23:52.577]  And escape to another artificial dimension from a system God's created.
[00:23:53.077 --> 00:23:54.578]  They are trying to run from God.
[00:23:54.718 --> 00:23:56.099]  We must run towards God.
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.180]  This is the truth.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:01.023]  Noah, Yuval Harari and Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab are not God.
[00:24:01.043 --> 00:24:02.544]  In fact, they're the opposite of God.
[00:24:02.824 --> 00:24:04.065]  They are disconnected from God.
[00:24:04.285 --> 00:24:07.627]  And by reaching out to God, we can and will transcend them.
[00:24:07.907 --> 00:24:09.468]  We must choose God or Satan.
[00:24:09.808 --> 00:24:10.709]  The choice is yours.
[00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:12.911]  Even not making a choice is a choice.
[00:24:13.171 --> 00:24:13.851]  We'll be right back.
[00:24:14.131 --> 00:24:15.092]  InfoWars.com.
[00:24:15.272 --> 00:24:16.093]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:24:18.513 --> 00:24:30.559]  If you just joined us here on this live Wednesday broadcast, I want to invite you to go to the archives at man.video later today once the analysis I just laid out is posted.
[00:24:30.579 --> 00:24:34.461]  It's only about 25 minutes long, and it's so important.
[00:24:35.181 --> 00:25:05.274]   Whether you believe the globalists are going to be successful or not in creating the system they say they're building, and they are building it, It's so central to understand that it's a nightmare authoritarian world where full control is taken over human development and human evolution in their words to not empower humanity but to depopulate the vast majority of us and on its ashes build their world government technocracy where they believe they're going to be gods.
[00:25:05.954 --> 00:25:09.397]  They have decided to bring down civilization as we know it.
[00:25:10.117 --> 00:25:18.883]  And the adherents, the cult members that join this system and go along with it believe they're about to be given everlasting artificial life and be gods.
[00:25:19.964 --> 00:25:32.976]   Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a psychotic cult Transhumanist is setting up a planetary world government and their holy grail is life extension technology.
[00:25:33.636 --> 00:25:42.726]  I covered my film Endgame made in 2007 and it's more pertinent today because their agenda is now out in the open.
[00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:59.765]   That's why I asked listeners To realize that this broadcast is so important in the fight against these people because we have their battle plan, we have their number, we have their M.O., their modus operandi, and we know how to stop them.
[00:26:00.145 --> 00:26:22.259]   That's why the corporate media, the globalist left wing, the technocracy absolutely hate us because they want the public blissfully distracted by Netflix and sports and all the entertainment, not realizing that a Forced planetary collapse and a new dark age is being implemented as we speak.
[00:26:22.279 --> 00:26:27.823]  That's why I want to thank the long-term listeners and viewers and also all the new viewers that are tuning in.
[00:26:28.203 --> 00:26:31.766]  Because without you, humanity literally would not have a fighting chance.
[00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:49.766]  That's why it's important to take time out to thank the crew, all of our AM and FM affiliates, our TV affiliates, our sponsors, our listeners and viewers particularly, and all the prominent people that now realize that our analysis has been dead on and understand that the globalists are coming after us because we're on to something.
[00:26:50.146 --> 00:26:51.768]  We're on to the New World Order agenda.
[00:26:52.288 --> 00:26:53.309]  And we know how to stop it.
[00:26:53.649 --> 00:27:08.015]  Not just resisting their agenda, not just exposing their agenda, not just warning the public about their operations, but also promoting a better system that's pro-human, that's based on truth and justice and God and family and competition.
[00:27:08.855 --> 00:27:22.439]  I'm about to hand the baton to Owen Schroyer and the big broadcast he's got lined up today, but I just want to encourage listeners again to let it sink in that you're the reason InfoWars is still here, despite the desperate globalist attacks, and that they're far from all-powerful.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.160]  And that when you take action, nothing can stop you.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:30.602]  So please, take advantage of the last few days we've got, it ends on Friday, of the biggest sell of the year.

[00:28:51.886 --> 00:28:55.628]  Because the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:28:56.028 --> 00:29:02.091]  That's why they're so desperate to suppress us, and we're beginning to turn the tide, not just here in America, but around the world.

[00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.151]  Now I hand the baton to Owen Schroeder.
[00:29:27.012 --> 00:29:35.377]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are now live inside the InfoWars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas with you today.
[00:29:37.307 --> 00:29:43.030]  And let me just kind of reset the transmission here and tell you what's coming up.
[00:29:43.110 --> 00:30:11.392]   We are going to be joined in the next hour and for the hour by Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec to talk about all kinds of midterm election issues, specifically the debates that have just happened where Fetterman was just an unmitigated disaster and the only defense that the Democrat media Collusion has is, oh, he's a victim of a stroke.
[00:30:11.812 --> 00:30:12.992]  Oh, he's recovering from a stroke.
[00:30:13.012 --> 00:30:15.954]  So before it was, he's fine, it's no problem, his health is fine.
[00:30:16.394 --> 00:30:22.177]  Then you see the debate last night and the disaster that Federman is, and it's, well, he's recovering from a stroke.
[00:30:23.397 --> 00:30:25.838]  And that's basically all they can do to promote him.
[00:30:25.858 --> 00:30:31.041]  But every poll had Oz winning last night's debate in a landslide.
[00:30:32.001 --> 00:30:35.406]   Folks, if you watched it, I mean, you know how bad it was.
[00:30:35.426 --> 00:30:36.787]  There's really no words to describe.
[00:30:36.827 --> 00:30:37.647]  It's actually sad.
[00:30:38.568 --> 00:30:39.588]  It's actually quite sad.
[00:30:39.968 --> 00:30:45.151]  From the beginning to the end of the hour-long debate, Fetterman was just not well.
[00:30:45.851 --> 00:30:46.732]  Just not well at all.
[00:30:46.772 --> 00:30:48.013]  So we'll be talking about that.
[00:30:48.033 --> 00:30:53.235]  I'm going to come back and talk about some of the latest vaccine news.
[00:30:53.976 --> 00:30:56.177]  We also have some internet censorship news.
[00:30:56.397 --> 00:31:00.840]  There were some big legal developments, I guess you could say.
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.861]   Or rather, You had Daryl Brooks found guilty on all accounts.
[00:31:06.901 --> 00:31:08.182]  That just happened moments ago.
[00:31:08.762 --> 00:31:10.284]  Daryl Brooks guilty on all accounts.
[00:31:10.324 --> 00:31:11.485]  The Waukesha Massacre.
[00:31:11.925 --> 00:31:15.468]  Now you notice you didn't have mainstream media foaming at the mouth over that story.
[00:31:15.908 --> 00:31:18.771]  You didn't have the cameras rolling in the courtroom 24-7.
[00:31:19.892 --> 00:31:21.293]  Why is that?
[00:31:22.274 --> 00:31:25.536]  Why wasn't more attention paid to the Waukesha Massacre killer?
[00:31:25.677 --> 00:31:29.119]  Oh, because he was a radicalized leftist.
[00:31:30.501 --> 00:31:45.564]   A radicalized Leftist, and so he can't be covered, he can't be talked about when he killed six white people and ran over 70 plus people in an intentional race-based, political-based attack.
[00:31:47.005 --> 00:31:49.487]  Oh no, I'm sure it was just a coincidence, how dare I say that?
[00:31:50.762 --> 00:31:56.265]  Well, he was found guilty, but there was another school shooting that happened in St.
[00:31:56.305 --> 00:31:58.407]  Louis this week that you didn't really hear about either.
[00:31:58.467 --> 00:32:00.228]  Now, why would that be?
[00:32:00.968 --> 00:32:16.338]  Also, some of the big crime wave news that's so important ahead of the midterms as well, where you have stores in Philadelphia and Los Angeles and San Francisco and Chicago and New York City saying, we're closing our doors permanently, it's too dangerous here.
[00:32:18.211 --> 00:32:20.933]  So that's going to be coming up as well.
[00:32:23.015 --> 00:32:25.417]  We've got some border news we'll be covering.
[00:32:25.698 --> 00:32:37.348]  Oh, and also, Greg Manarino is going to be joining me in the third hour to discuss some of the latest economic news with the bond market instability, U.S.
[00:32:37.408 --> 00:32:41.472]  dollar, the lie that low rates are the cause for inflation.
[00:32:42.995 --> 00:32:51.763]  The rising possibility of false flags, specifically with the developments in Ukraine between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States that are embedded in that war.
[00:32:52.863 --> 00:32:53.904]  They're just now admitting it.
[00:32:54.045 --> 00:32:57.187]  It's been going on for months, but now they're telling you that that's what's going on.
[00:32:57.247 --> 00:32:59.329]  So imagine what they have planned next.
[00:32:59.709 --> 00:33:01.671]  So you can imagine six months ago the U.S.
[00:33:01.711 --> 00:33:02.752]  was already boots on the ground.
[00:33:03.333 --> 00:33:04.373]  Now they're telling you that.
[00:33:04.814 --> 00:33:09.318]  So what are they doing now that you're going to learn about six months from now, or perhaps less?
[00:33:11.215 --> 00:33:15.857]  So, all of that coming up here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:15.897 --> 00:33:18.798]  But when we come back, I'll get into some of the vaccine news.
[00:33:18.878 --> 00:33:27.222]  As Joe Biden just got his fifth vaccine, they claim, if you believe that, fifth booster for Joe, telling you it's time to get yours.
[00:33:27.602 --> 00:33:32.365]  But some new vaccine data has even the Washington Post alarmed.
[00:33:33.865 --> 00:33:35.106]  There's Joe Biden.
[00:33:37.998 --> 00:33:39.661]  Getting his fifth booster!
[00:33:40.001 --> 00:33:41.564]  At least that's what they're claiming here.
[00:33:41.624 --> 00:33:42.846]  Now you see the propaganda.
[00:33:42.946 --> 00:33:44.769]  Oh, there's the doctor with the mask on.
[00:33:45.410 --> 00:33:46.591]  He's gotta wear the mask.
[00:33:47.393 --> 00:33:49.035]  Just to remind you to be in fear.
[00:33:49.756 --> 00:33:51.139]  And you need your face muzzle.
[00:33:52.383 --> 00:33:56.606]  Joe Biden allegedly getting his fifth COVID vaccine.
[00:33:56.826 --> 00:33:57.967]  If you believe that.
[00:33:58.047 --> 00:33:59.428]  I have a hard time actually believing that.
[00:33:59.468 --> 00:34:00.628]  They know a fifth vaccine.
[00:34:00.648 --> 00:34:06.832]  I mean, you gotta be up to probably a 25% chance after vaccine number five to have a life-altering side effect.
[00:34:07.233 --> 00:34:08.153]  Although, who knows?
[00:34:08.213 --> 00:34:10.274]  Joe Biden did say he could drop dead any day now.
[00:34:10.435 --> 00:34:12.456]  Maybe he was referencing the vaccine they were about to hit him with.
[00:34:14.197 --> 00:34:38.018]   But actually, if you go back to the clip, you can hear, the audio is really low, but you can hear in the clip Joe Biden is asked, because the media doesn't get any access to the President, he's hidden, he's protected, and so this was some of the only time the media had access to him to ask about the Saudi Arabia situation, to which he responded, get the shot.
[00:34:38.118 --> 00:34:43.380]  And so guys, let's pull up the audio, it's going to need some serious boost, but you might as well just hear it.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.861]  So here's Joe Biden getting his fifth booster shot.
[00:34:47.881 --> 00:34:56.927]  And then, uh, since the media can't get any access, except when he's in the fake White House, by the way, that's him in the fake White House basement, the little TV studio they have set up.
[00:34:56.947 --> 00:34:58.809]  They don't actually want media in the White House.
[00:35:02.451 --> 00:35:04.492]  Sir, I think it was a mistake from your tour.
[00:35:04.972 --> 00:35:06.972]  So it's... yeah, here we go.
[00:35:06.972 --> 00:35:10.972]  [inaudible]
[00:35:10.972 --> 00:35:16.972]  [inaudible]
[00:35:16.672 --> 00:35:20.254]  So she asks, what is your thought on the Saudis and the oil problem that you have?
[00:35:20.294 --> 00:35:21.895]  Oh, get your COVID shot, as he laughs.
[00:35:21.975 --> 00:35:22.696]  Get your COVID shot.
[00:35:22.716 --> 00:35:23.857]  That's the answer to everything.
[00:35:24.457 --> 00:35:27.899]  It's the answer to every problem in the history of mankind.
[00:35:28.739 --> 00:35:30.761]  Just get your COVID shot, dammit.
[00:35:32.842 --> 00:35:37.865]  But if you can't see how this is obvious propaganda, here's the President's Twitter account.
[00:35:39.286 --> 00:35:42.690]  I guess after Joe got the injection there.
[00:35:43.451 --> 00:35:46.875]  And it's a picture of him smiling, pointing at his arm on the injection site.
[00:35:46.955 --> 00:35:51.159]  And then it's a picture he's apparently FaceTiming here with Anthony Fauci.
[00:35:52.501 --> 00:35:55.484]  And I forget the other gentleman's name.
[00:35:55.544 --> 00:35:59.509]  Big, big vaccine promoter there in the Biden administration.
[00:36:01.809 --> 00:36:04.131]  Yeah, that's such clear propaganda.
[00:36:04.231 --> 00:36:05.152]  Oh yeah, thumbs up!
[00:36:05.192 --> 00:36:06.413]  Yeah, way to go Joe!
[00:36:06.473 --> 00:36:07.074]  You did it!
[00:36:07.774 --> 00:36:09.336]  Your fifth vaccine!
[00:36:09.816 --> 00:36:10.537]  Yeah!
[00:36:10.897 --> 00:36:16.242]  And how sick is it they promote this to Americans as if it's safe and effective when it's neither.
[00:36:17.083 --> 00:36:21.703]   And I would be surprised if he actually took the real COVID vaccine.
[00:36:21.823 --> 00:36:22.964]  I would be surprised if that's the case.
[00:36:23.044 --> 00:36:25.385]  Oh, Fauci giving you the thumbs up.
[00:36:26.446 --> 00:36:28.448]  And Biden's other health director giving you the thumbs up.
[00:36:28.628 --> 00:36:29.148]  Oh, yeah.
[00:36:29.308 --> 00:36:29.809]  Oh, yeah.
[00:36:29.889 --> 00:36:31.009]  It's great, man.
[00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.791]  Yeah, get that vaccine.
[00:36:32.911 --> 00:36:33.511]  Yeah.
[00:36:35.093 --> 00:36:38.655]  Just 50,000 dead from it that we know of.
[00:36:40.216 --> 00:36:41.157]  Vivek Murphy.
[00:36:42.018 --> 00:36:42.918]  That's the guy's name.
[00:36:42.958 --> 00:36:43.519]  Thank you, crew.
[00:36:44.963 --> 00:36:49.609]  Yeah, just 7.7% of the people that get it have a life-altering side effect.
[00:36:49.669 --> 00:36:50.430]  Yeah.
[00:36:51.411 --> 00:36:52.452]  Get that Vax.
[00:36:53.554 --> 00:36:54.355]  Get that Vax.
[00:36:54.395 --> 00:36:54.935]  But okay.
[00:36:55.636 --> 00:36:59.782]  Here's some of the post-Vax press conference moments.
[00:37:01.983 --> 00:37:04.344]  And so we're rehashing this argument.
[00:37:04.364 --> 00:37:05.525]  Remember the winter of death?
[00:37:05.745 --> 00:37:08.426]  Joe Biden said it would be a winter of death for the unvaccinated.
[00:37:09.026 --> 00:37:09.807]  That was a lie.
[00:37:10.087 --> 00:37:16.170]  But here he is rebranding that in clip D, saying you better get your shots.
[00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:18.651]  The people that don't, well, it's not going to be good for you.
[00:37:18.671 --> 00:37:23.353]  Virtually every COVID death in America is preventable.
[00:37:23.973 --> 00:37:24.854]  Virtually every one.
[00:37:25.521 --> 00:37:34.307]  Almost everyone who will die from COVID this year will not be up to date on their shots, or they will not have taken Paxlovid when they got sick.
[00:37:34.868 --> 00:37:35.948]  So he's just lying.
[00:37:36.749 --> 00:37:38.730]  In fact, the data is the exact opposite.
[00:37:39.451 --> 00:37:43.174]  Most of the COVID deaths are vaccinated people.
[00:37:43.654 --> 00:37:48.818]  In fact, it's like 90% now, 90% of COVID deaths are from individuals that are vaccinated.
[00:37:48.898 --> 00:37:50.439]  So, just an outright lie.
[00:37:51.854 --> 00:37:54.837]  But hey, maybe you're not falling for the propaganda.
[00:37:55.197 --> 00:37:56.758]  Maybe a bribe, hmm?
[00:37:57.139 --> 00:38:01.422]  How about a little bribe to get you to join the VAX side?
[00:38:01.442 --> 00:38:02.924]  How about a little bribe?
[00:38:02.964 --> 00:38:08.088]  Here's Biden bribing the American people to get the vaccine in clip C. Get the shot.
[00:38:08.749 --> 00:38:16.495]  Five, ten, twenty dollars off your drugstore grocery purchase or grocery purchase next time at the same time you get the shot.
[00:38:18.277 --> 00:38:19.218]  They're all laughing!
[00:38:20.387 --> 00:38:22.008]  They're all laughing at you.
[00:38:22.128 --> 00:38:23.429]  It's such a joke at this point.
[00:38:23.469 --> 00:38:25.270]  Joe Biden can't say it with a straight face.
[00:38:25.711 --> 00:38:27.872]  When he's talking, the people behind him are laughing.
[00:38:27.892 --> 00:38:29.353]  This is all a joke.
[00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:31.815]  It is all a big fat joke.
[00:38:31.875 --> 00:38:42.442]  They know the vaccine is not safe, not effective, and here they are pushing it to you, laughing in your face, thinking the American people are so stupid that they won't know any better.
[00:38:43.717 --> 00:38:46.360]  But the American people do know better.
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.103]  And sadly, many of them have learned to know better.
[00:38:51.665 --> 00:38:56.369]  And COVID, or the vaccine, has been the red pill to swallow to learn better.
[00:38:57.610 --> 00:39:03.175]  But the Washington Post, who you know, the liberal Washington Post, loves to make everything about race.
[00:39:03.736 --> 00:39:05.558]  Normally, you'd call that a racist.
[00:39:06.781 --> 00:39:20.806]  And they're confused because remember they were saying how COVID disproportionately affects black Americans and so therefore it's a more serious problem but now the data doesn't actually bear that out and they're concerned.
[00:39:21.886 --> 00:39:30.274]   The post analysis found that black deaths declined while white deaths Never eased until the mortality gap flipped.
[00:39:31.014 --> 00:39:32.215]  Because it's all about race.
[00:39:32.655 --> 00:39:34.876]  Because that's what racists care about.
[00:39:35.517 --> 00:39:42.401]  From the end of October through the end of December 2021, white people died at a higher rate than black people did, the Post found.
[00:39:43.701 --> 00:39:44.042]  What?
[00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:46.983]  White death rates have risen compared with others?
[00:39:47.424 --> 00:39:48.424]  What could this be?
[00:39:49.765 --> 00:39:52.827]  We can't have white people as the biggest victim of anything!
[00:39:53.672 --> 00:39:55.414]  Blacks must be the biggest victim!
[00:39:55.814 --> 00:39:57.536]  Or Jews must be the biggest victim!
[00:39:57.896 --> 00:39:59.117]  Or the Palestinians!
[00:39:59.638 --> 00:40:00.839]  Not the whites!
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:03.562]  It's the minoritas!
[00:40:05.664 --> 00:40:06.184]  Oh no!
[00:40:07.085 --> 00:40:07.866]  What could it be?
[00:40:08.446 --> 00:40:11.129]  Whites now more likely to die from COVID than blacks.
[00:40:11.930 --> 00:40:13.371]  Why the pandemic shifted?
[00:40:13.391 --> 00:40:16.955]  Well there's a thing about that, actually.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:26.646]  In a study, latest data on COVID-19 vaccinations by race and ethnicity.
[00:40:29.108 --> 00:40:33.491]  And so, let's go into the study here.
[00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:36.273]  And let's see what they found.
[00:40:36.773 --> 00:40:42.517]  Black and Hispanic people have been less likely than their white counterparts to receive a vaccine.
[00:40:42.537 --> 00:40:42.578]  Ah!
[00:40:46.904 --> 00:40:47.644]  Ah, okay.
[00:40:48.084 --> 00:40:49.745]  So, we now know what it is then.
[00:40:51.465 --> 00:40:55.666]  Why are white people dying more than black people?
[00:40:55.706 --> 00:40:56.686]  That can't be the case.
[00:40:56.726 --> 00:41:02.127]  The Washington Post always says it's black people that are the biggest victim, and then I guess brown people, anybody but the whites.
[00:41:02.607 --> 00:41:06.208]  But now they see that the white people are the ones dying from COVID.
[00:41:07.208 --> 00:41:10.889]  And then you realize it's because the white people are the ones getting the vaccine.
[00:41:12.189 --> 00:41:12.549]  Yeah.
[00:41:14.048 --> 00:41:17.529]  So Joe Biden says if you don't get the vaccine, you're going to die from COVID.
[00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:21.571]  All of the data shows 90% of the COVID deaths are people that have been vaccinated.
[00:41:21.891 --> 00:41:24.612]  The Washington Post says, why aren't black people dying from COVID anymore?
[00:41:25.032 --> 00:41:28.013]  And the research data says because black people aren't taking the vaccine.
[00:41:28.814 --> 00:41:33.455]  Isn't it fun having to correct all the Democrat Party propaganda here every day?
[00:41:33.795 --> 00:41:34.496]  Isn't it fun?
[00:41:35.888 --> 00:41:45.366]  Having to sort out all the mainstream fake news media propaganda, all the big pharmaceutical propaganda, CDC propaganda, Fauci propaganda, every day.
[00:41:45.547 --> 00:41:46.288]  Isn't it fun?
[00:41:48.632 --> 00:41:51.973]  But of course, we were on the tip of the spear on this.
[00:41:52.013 --> 00:42:05.815]  We were on the leading edge on this, just like everything else here at InfoWars, while others were promoting the vaccine, like Ben Shapiro, who was not just promoting the vaccine, he was then shaming individuals like Elijah Schaefer, who were warning against taking the vaccine.
[00:42:06.355 --> 00:42:07.295]  This is Ben Shapiro.
[00:42:07.875 --> 00:42:09.376]  This is Ben Shapiro today, though.
[00:42:10.436 --> 00:42:12.836]  In fact, guys, let's just play a brief moment of the clip.
[00:42:13.056 --> 00:42:14.997]  So here's Ben Shapiro.
[00:42:15.077 --> 00:42:16.217]  I believe we have it here, guys.
[00:42:16.517 --> 00:42:17.137]  Do we have the clip?
[00:42:17.864 --> 00:42:26.378]  Here's Ben Shapiro after telling you to take the vaccine, saying the vaccine is safe and effective, saying it should be mandated, and criticizing people that disagreed.
[00:42:26.579 --> 00:42:27.560]  Here's Ben Shapiro today.
[00:42:28.246 --> 00:42:30.448]  It is now perfectly clear that we were lied to.
[00:42:30.908 --> 00:42:34.071]  That we were lied to, and we were lied to at a very high level from very, very early on.
[00:42:34.151 --> 00:42:35.912]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:42:36.153 --> 00:42:36.453]  That's enough.
[00:42:36.653 --> 00:42:36.773]  Oh!
[00:42:37.113 --> 00:42:39.275]  It's now perfectly clear, guys!
[00:42:39.696 --> 00:42:43.599]  It's now perfectly clear because Ben Shapiro says so.
[00:42:43.979 --> 00:42:45.380]  It's now perfectly clear.
[00:42:45.601 --> 00:42:50.725]  He says, Pfizer has now admitted they did not test whether the COVID vaccines prevented transmission before releasing them.
[00:42:51.085 --> 00:42:52.847]  No, that was always known.
[00:42:53.027 --> 00:42:54.148]  All of this was always known.
[00:42:55.643 --> 00:43:02.273]  But hey, Ben Shapiro being two years late is perfectly fine, but he's not going to apologize because he lied about it too.
[00:43:02.554 --> 00:43:05.699]  He's not going to apologize because he repeated the propaganda too.
[00:43:06.179 --> 00:43:06.520]  No, no, no.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:08.844]  He's going to act like he's the one telling you the truth now.
[00:43:09.912 --> 00:43:10.092]  Yeah.
[00:43:11.093 --> 00:43:17.177]  Rand Paul demands answers over Vax Company PR firm's embedded staff within CDC to promote vaccines.
[00:43:17.617 --> 00:43:18.578]  Well, yeah, I mean, of course.
[00:43:18.598 --> 00:43:19.899]  And they got their lobbyists, too.
[00:43:20.299 --> 00:43:22.901]  And then Joe Biden says, we beat Big Pharma.
[00:43:23.061 --> 00:43:23.441]  Remember that?
[00:43:23.461 --> 00:43:24.682]  He says, we beat Big Pharma.
[00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:25.763]  Now go take your vaccine.
[00:43:26.443 --> 00:43:27.884]  Potential violation of HIPAA.
[00:43:28.365 --> 00:43:34.830]  Mother outraged after CDC called her for survey asking number of kids in the household eligible for vaccination.
[00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:39.714]  Yeah, because then they want to send their little minions out there to force inoculate your children.
[00:43:39.794 --> 00:43:41.055]  Don't you know that's how it works?
[00:43:41.355 --> 00:43:42.956]  Safe and effective, safe and effective.
[00:43:43.296 --> 00:43:46.019]  And then a year later, oops, not safe, not effective.
[00:43:46.059 --> 00:43:48.941]  But hey, it's mandated for kids and Joe Biden just got his fifth shot.
[00:43:48.781 --> 00:43:50.061]  So come on, join the club.
[00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:58.741]  [MUSIC]
[00:43:58.741 --> 00:44:01.101]  I don't promote things unless they really work.

[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:03.600]   Well, really excited for this next hour of the Alex Jones show,
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:06.600]   because we're going to be joined by Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec.
[00:45:06.922 --> 00:45:20.452]  In fact, we are joined by them right now, and we're going to be covering the debates that have been going on, specifically the big Senate debate between Fetterman and Oz, which was beyond a disaster for Fetterman.
[00:45:20.512 --> 00:45:22.413]  Just beyond a disaster.
[00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:25.956]  We'll play some of those clips coming up, but I bring in Steve.
[00:45:26.636 --> 00:45:45.605]  Bannon and Jack Posobiec now and and guys let's just kind of give just a brief reaction to the debates whether it's the Zeldin Hokel debate and the Federman Oz debate or just all the debates or in some cases lack thereof Just what's been your kind of initial response to this now 13 days from the midterm Steve Bannon?
[00:45:47.074 --> 00:45:53.097]  Well, first off, last night, Tudor Dixon took it to Whitmer, and Lee Zeldin took it to Hochul, and I think this is the issue.
[00:45:53.237 --> 00:45:57.339]  Every time you're on a debate stage with a MAGA Republican, they're bringing heat.
[00:45:57.779 --> 00:45:59.339]  And this is why people don't want to debate.
[00:45:59.359 --> 00:46:02.401]  This is why Josh Shapiro's not debating Mastriano.
[00:46:02.681 --> 00:46:07.043]  You know, Posobiec's a son of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
[00:46:07.583 --> 00:46:17.118]  For a place that has that much history, that means that much to the American people, all the way from the revolution, from the founding of the nation to the revolution, the Civil War, down to the current day.
[00:46:17.919 --> 00:46:20.661]  It was, Owen, I think it's nothing more than a humiliation.
[00:46:20.721 --> 00:46:26.145]  It shows you how crass and cynical the Democrats are.
[00:46:26.225 --> 00:46:27.646]  He's a guy who's very ill.
[00:46:27.686 --> 00:46:31.009]  I mean, we cover him as the cyborg because he's half man and half machine.
[00:46:31.469 --> 00:46:34.952]  And now you're seeing they're complaining about that, Owen, that it wasn't done right.
[00:46:34.972 --> 00:46:36.173]  And we knew that was going to happen.
[00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:37.734]  That's the problem with having a cyborg.
[00:46:38.375 --> 00:46:39.976]  But I actually felt for the guy.
[00:46:40.496 --> 00:46:41.957]  He's seriously ill.
[00:46:42.037 --> 00:46:46.041]  He has a very tough, you know, rehab to go for him.
[00:46:46.141 --> 00:46:49.404]  And the Democrats are so callous to put it out there.
[00:46:49.424 --> 00:46:59.452]  And Posobiec, I think, nailed it this morning on his Twitter, that they want Shapiro to sneak in here without debating to win and then to appoint the wife to be the senator.
[00:46:59.512 --> 00:47:03.736]  So, Jack, I know this had to hurt you last night, being a son of Pennsylvania.
[00:47:05.606 --> 00:47:06.768]  No, Steve, that's exactly right.
[00:47:06.848 --> 00:47:26.610]   So, what they're trying to do, and Richard Barris actually just covered this on his show, but he said, look, if they can get both Democrats in by fortifying the election as hard as possible, the same way we've seen fortified elections before, what they'll do is, John Fetterman, if he's elected, the plan is for him to not serve a single day in the United States Senate.
[00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.849]   They will appoint, and they have a list of people, it's a short list, but of course at
[00:47:29.849 --> 00:47:34.289]   the very top of that list, and Steve, I've been saying this on War Room for months now,
[00:47:34.289 --> 00:47:35.289]  it's the wife.
[00:47:35.289 --> 00:47:41.330]   They want to appoint, think of it, she's endorsed and blue checked on Twitter as a verified
[00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:45.330]  Twitter user as the second lady of Pennsylvania.
[00:47:45.330 --> 00:47:49.210]   Doug Mastriano, the actual Republican candidate, isn't even verified.
[00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:52.810]   We're the only state-wide in Pennsylvania where Twitter won't allow this.
[00:47:52.810 --> 00:47:55.810]  And so we can see the fix has been in from the start.
[00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.250]  At the end of the day, Steve--
[00:47:57.722 --> 00:48:02.384]  I came on this program last week with Alex and I said, they're putting Fetterman up as a prototype.
[00:48:02.644 --> 00:48:04.104]  This isn't even about the election.
[00:48:04.124 --> 00:48:19.850]  They want to see if they can take someone whose mind has already been damaged and then combine them with this machine assistance in order to show a prototype of the technology, roll it out, and for the transhumanist agenda.
[00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:21.590]  Now, I don't think the technology is there yet.
[00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:33.999]   As we saw last night, the technology ain't there or you have to show that you need Uh, you need the subject to be at a certain mental acuity, which of course Fetterman was not yet for the technology to be successful.
[00:48:34.059 --> 00:48:35.540]  So we didn't get that last night.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:40.585]  We saw, and of course we see him complaining, he's blaming it on the technology, he's blaming it on the system, but what are they doing?
[00:48:41.105 --> 00:48:43.487]  What are they doing in the midst of all of this?
[00:48:43.527 --> 00:48:47.871]  While we see Fetterman, while he's complaining about, his campaign's complaining about the system, the computer.
[00:48:48.391 --> 00:48:59.164]  They're normalizing the idea of candidates using computer assistance and computer technology impacted directly into their mind.
[00:48:59.524 --> 00:49:01.987]  A mind-man merger.
[00:49:02.877 --> 00:49:05.780]  On stage, right before our eyes, they're normalizing this.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:13.008]  They're normalizing it to the point where they're saying, oh, the computer was just malfunctioning, but it's totally normal for a candidate to be hooked up like this.
[00:49:13.809 --> 00:49:21.617]  Owen, Owen, this is, I know we got just a short segment here, but this is what they've been condemning Alex Jones as a conspiracy theory guy for a decade, right?
[00:49:22.357 --> 00:49:24.540]  Are we not seeing what Alex Jones has warned about?
[00:49:24.580 --> 00:49:26.642]  Last night you saw a man-machine merger.
[00:49:26.962 --> 00:49:28.363]  It's just not closed caption.
[00:49:28.403 --> 00:49:30.666]  We had our transhumanist editor there, Joe Allen.
[00:49:30.966 --> 00:49:33.749]  It's a whole system to kind of make it right for his brain.
[00:49:34.209 --> 00:49:38.073]  And they complained this morning that the system wasn't set up correctly.
[00:49:38.113 --> 00:49:42.998]  They had to gall to complain that the system that had the man-machine merger...
[00:49:44.019 --> 00:49:48.691]  Oops, the president just got us in a nuclear war because the system wasn't working.
[00:49:48.771 --> 00:49:50.435]  His brain implant wasn't working.
[00:49:50.455 --> 00:49:52.380]  Oh, oops, our bad, sorry.
[00:49:53.689 --> 00:49:57.553]  And we're joined here by the great Steve Bannon and Jack Posobiec.
[00:49:57.573 --> 00:50:03.578]  We're breaking down last night's debates, specifically what happened with the Fetterman-Oz debate.
[00:50:03.638 --> 00:50:08.463]  And folks, if you don't think it was that bad, it really was worse.
[00:50:09.103 --> 00:50:14.629]  Here is the opening statement from Fetterman, just an example of what a disaster last night was.
[00:50:16.207 --> 00:50:16.427]  Hi.
[00:50:16.587 --> 00:50:17.387]  Good night, everybody.
[00:50:18.587 --> 00:50:20.368]  I'm running to serve Pennsylvania.
[00:50:20.988 --> 00:50:22.668]  He's running to use Pennsylvania.
[00:50:23.208 --> 00:50:28.609]  Here's a man that spent more than $20 million of his own money to try to buy that seat.
[00:50:30.049 --> 00:50:37.751]  I'm also having to talk about something called the Oz Rule, that if he's on TV, he's lying.
[00:50:38.271 --> 00:50:41.011]  He did that during his career on his TV show.
[00:50:41.531 --> 00:50:50.977]   He's done that during his campaign about lying about Our record here, and he's also lying probably during this debate.
[00:50:51.498 --> 00:50:53.599]  And let's also talk about the elephant in the room.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:54.881]  I had a stroke.
[00:50:55.381 --> 00:50:56.662]  He's never let me forget that.
[00:50:57.683 --> 00:51:05.290]  And I might miss some words during this debate, mush two words together, but it knocked me down, but I'm going to keep coming back up.
[00:51:05.771 --> 00:51:11.676]   And this campaign is all about to me is about fighting for every one Okay, I mean, the fumbles, the stutters, admitting he's having problems.
[00:51:11.696 --> 00:51:12.917]  Steve Bannon, what did we just see there?
[00:51:12.737 --> 00:51:17.697]   to get back up and fighting for all forgotten communities all across Pennsylvania that also
[00:51:17.697 --> 00:51:21.096]  got knocked down that needs to keep get back up.
[00:51:21.096 --> 00:51:26.777]   Okay, I mean the fumbles, the stutters, admitting he's having problems.
[00:51:26.777 --> 00:51:29.456]  Steve Bannon, what did we just see there?
[00:51:29.456 --> 00:51:37.416]   That was, I mean, at the beginning, it was, it's so awful that you sit there and go, what
[00:51:38.414 --> 00:51:40.199]  I mean, this guy can't, can't have them.
[00:51:40.319 --> 00:51:42.585]  And look, if you look at the New York and Michigan debate.
[00:51:43.343 --> 00:51:50.530]  And I think Tudor Dixon and Lee Zeldin crushed their Democratic opposition, right?
[00:51:50.570 --> 00:51:51.371]  Two sitting governors.
[00:51:51.551 --> 00:51:52.692]  But it was give and take.
[00:51:52.732 --> 00:51:53.993]  It was thrust and parry.
[00:51:54.313 --> 00:51:56.315]  They were at each other for the entire time.
[00:51:56.355 --> 00:52:01.340]  And Owen, quite frankly, someone I want to get to, your last segment about the vaccines was a big part of both of those.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:04.803]  But there you had people defending policy and other people, all of them.
[00:52:04.903 --> 00:52:06.324]  That's where the debate's supposed to be.
[00:52:06.785 --> 00:52:09.227]   What you saw last night, Was pathetic.
[00:52:09.307 --> 00:52:12.569]  It was beneath the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to have to watch that.
[00:52:12.670 --> 00:52:14.371]  And here's where I really got a problem with.
[00:52:14.811 --> 00:52:16.753]  Josh Shapiro has not come out.
[00:52:17.093 --> 00:52:18.694]  He's still hiding from Asciano.
[00:52:19.034 --> 00:52:22.277]  And he will not come out and condemn what happened last night by the Democratic Party.
[00:52:22.998 --> 00:52:24.759]  Jack, you're a Pennsylvania voter.
[00:52:24.819 --> 00:52:26.400]  What did you see last night?
[00:52:27.961 --> 00:52:30.343]  Look, I saw it was disrespectful.
[00:52:30.924 --> 00:52:33.486]  It was disrespectful to John Fetterman.
[00:52:34.244 --> 00:52:39.373]  To his family, in a sense, though I know obviously his wife plays a huge role in this.
[00:52:39.393 --> 00:52:42.418]  And it was disrespectful to my family.
[00:52:42.658 --> 00:52:45.784]  It was disrespectful to the people of Pennsylvania, the people of our Commonwealth.
[00:52:45.804 --> 00:52:47.607]  Look, Pennsylvania's hurting right now.
[00:52:48.266 --> 00:53:20.955]   Whether you're looking at the fentanyl that's pouring into our state from all over the world, obviously across the southern border, coming directly from the Chinese Communist Party, whether it's the crime that's pouring out of Philadelphia, murdering children in our streets, coming out into the suburbs there from Philadelphia, people getting killed at football games, people getting killed in the street there, and then nobody getting locked up over this, You see a massive amount of disrespect for the people of our state who are hurting because of these economic policies.
[00:53:21.015 --> 00:53:26.018]  And one of the big policies that did come up in terms of this was this idea of fracking.
[00:53:26.599 --> 00:53:43.389]  And should the people of Pennsylvania be able to utilize the resources that God bequeathed to them underneath the very ground of the state itself, the Marcellus Shale Find, the same as the Permian Basin, the Bracken Formation out west.
[00:53:44.764 --> 00:53:49.747]  Fetterman, when they asked him about this, you could tell that he forgot what he was supposed to say.
[00:53:50.027 --> 00:53:51.488]  He couldn't tell where he was.
[00:53:51.548 --> 00:53:53.810]  Well, Jack, let's play the clip.
[00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:56.351]  Let's give the evidence to what you're talking about and then respond.
[00:53:56.411 --> 00:53:58.152]  Here is the clip that Jack is talking about.
[00:53:58.212 --> 00:54:00.994]  Fetterman stumbling over the question on fracking.
[00:54:05.384 --> 00:54:07.465]  Mr. Oz, I do want to clarify something.
[00:54:07.845 --> 00:54:17.789]  You're saying tonight that you support fracking, that you've always supported fracking, but there is that 2018 interview that you said, quote, I don't support fracking at all.
[00:54:17.649 --> 00:54:19.649]  So how do you square the two?
[00:54:19.649 --> 00:54:29.649]   I do support fracking and I don't, I don't, I don't support it.
[00:54:29.649 --> 00:54:39.649]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:54:30.878 --> 00:54:34.237]  I support fracking and I stand and I do support fracking.
[00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:35.738]  Okay, thank you Mr.
[00:54:35.738 --> 00:54:41.458]   Okay, so obviously the answer was a bunch of fumbling and Jack to me he got confused I guess at the beginning
[00:54:41.458 --> 00:54:47.498]   he didn't even know the question was directed towards him and then he knows that the left-wing ideology is ban fracking
[00:54:47.498 --> 00:54:52.658]   but he knows he also can't say that on the debate stage. It would crush him. That's what I saw. What'd you see?
[00:54:52.658 --> 00:55:00.347]   Yeah, my guess is that and I'll put my analyst hat on here is that he probably had a prepared statement that his
[00:55:00.347 --> 00:55:01.338]  campaign had given him.
[00:55:01.327 --> 00:55:11.011]  If I were staffing him, if I were a guy on the left, one of these operatives, I would have given him a prepared statement that kind of threaded the needle to say that, you know, we have to have resources, but it has to be safe and environmental.
[00:55:11.351 --> 00:55:13.452]  He completely went into vapor lock.
[00:55:13.492 --> 00:55:16.994]  That was like a flashing 404 error up on his head.
[00:55:18.101 --> 00:55:36.476]  Look, Owen, when I just went up to Pennsylvania and I was in Erie, Pennsylvania, we talked about the Mastriano plan to build a Pennsylvania pipeline for that Freedom Gas straight up to Erie, another one out to Philadelphia, to put this Pennsylvania Freedom Gas out on the world market, actually be able to undercut OPEC and then ensure American energy dominance.
[00:55:36.796 --> 00:55:49.923]  It was probably the biggest applause line that I got, because we're talking six-figure jobs that would be coming back to the people of Pennsylvania, whether you're a trucker, whether you're a worker, whether you're someone who can go and actually work on these sites.
[00:55:50.223 --> 00:55:56.126]  These are massive, massive, and then the secondary-tertiary economic effects thereof in terms of utilizing this.
[00:55:56.186 --> 00:55:58.547]  Josh Shapiro, he wants to ban this.
[00:55:58.647 --> 00:56:00.508]  Federman, he's never been on the side of this.
[00:56:01.128 --> 00:56:05.549]  The coal mining, of course, obviously this would be a huge boon for Pennsylvania to actually start bringing this back.
[00:56:05.849 --> 00:56:08.490]  This is an agenda that it's not like the Dobbs decision.
[00:56:08.610 --> 00:56:12.650]  It's not like some of these other decisions that just kind of, you know, democracy is democracy at stake.
[00:56:12.810 --> 00:56:13.471]  What does that even mean?
[00:56:13.491 --> 00:56:15.391]  You can't put that in your fuel tank.
[00:56:15.411 --> 00:56:18.592]  You can't put that on your kitchen table and eat it at dinnertime.
[00:56:18.612 --> 00:56:21.492]  You can't serve the Dobbs decision and democracy to your children.
[00:56:21.792 --> 00:56:23.192]  These are things that actually matter.
[00:56:23.212 --> 00:56:25.593]  People are starting to go, you go to that northern tier of Pennsylvania.
[00:56:25.913 --> 00:56:36.045]  We wouldn't go to the dentist for the first time because dentists are opening up in some of these small towns because that's how bad it's been since they shipped all of our manufacturing jobs or steel jobs over to the Far East.
[00:56:36.366 --> 00:56:37.287]  That's how bad it's been.
[00:56:37.347 --> 00:56:43.054]  We can now bring it back with Mastriano and you have to stop Oz, you have to stop Shapiro in order to make this happen.
[00:56:43.908 --> 00:56:53.772]  Yeah, Steve, this has actually been one of your big issues when you were specifically working with Trump, was the jobs being sent out of America, specifically to China.
[00:56:54.172 --> 00:56:58.014]  And this is one of the agendas, to ship the energy off it, offshore the energy, too.
[00:56:58.074 --> 00:56:59.235]  We can bring the energy back.
[00:57:00.215 --> 00:57:04.377]  Look, that's a policy discussion, and we should have that, and the people of Pennsylvania should have that.
[00:57:04.737 --> 00:57:06.218]  That's not what we just saw.
[00:57:06.758 --> 00:57:09.459]  What we just saw is the cyborg had a malfunction.
[00:57:10.262 --> 00:57:15.164]  This is monumental, and that's why I think it's humiliating, but everybody in America should watch it.
[00:57:15.684 --> 00:57:28.048]  Pessoa just laid out a rational, and if you were in New York or if you were in Michigan, you had that thrust and parry of two conflicting ideas of what American industrial life should be and the economics around that.
[00:57:28.389 --> 00:57:29.609]  That's not what we just saw.
[00:57:30.089 --> 00:57:33.631]  What we just saw is the cyborg had a malfunction, okay?
[00:57:33.931 --> 00:57:34.771]  For whatever reason.
[00:57:35.231 --> 00:57:37.354]  And this is why it's a disgrace.
[00:57:37.814 --> 00:57:40.457]  This thing is at such a level we can't even honor it.
[00:57:40.477 --> 00:57:45.382]  To even put it up to having a policy discussion means that we're buying into the cyborg.
[00:57:45.843 --> 00:57:52.130]  And I don't say that to try to hurt this guy's feelings or try to hurt people's feelings or hurt his family.
[00:57:52.650 --> 00:57:54.853]  This is something that's very dangerous.
[00:57:55.433 --> 00:58:04.340]  It showed last night, and to have the political class, oh and this morning we woke up to the political class sitting there, oh gosh, we didn't really know it was that bad, he's hidden it so much.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.161]  That's a bald-faced lie.
[00:58:06.441 --> 00:58:13.286]  But Sobic has talked about this, he's been up there, he's talked about this on War Room for weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks.
[00:58:13.586 --> 00:58:15.448]  Everybody knew the shape this guy was in.
[00:58:15.908 --> 00:58:16.148]  Right?
[00:58:16.288 --> 00:58:17.129]  Everybody knew it.
[00:58:17.209 --> 00:58:18.469]  Everybody in the Democratic Party.
[00:58:18.649 --> 00:58:19.410]  All the media.
[00:58:19.470 --> 00:58:30.354]  And last night on MSNBC, the lead reporter for New York Magazine covering it, she went on and tried to make an excuse about how it was so amazing he was really countering ableism and he was up there.
[00:58:30.774 --> 00:58:31.915]  This is dangerous.
[00:58:31.935 --> 00:58:39.418]  You had man-machine merger and what you just saw right there is the man-machine merger, the cyborg malfunction on global television.
[00:58:40.018 --> 00:58:46.460]  Well, and we can't, because it's this difficult line that we walk now, too, where, hey, we're sympathetic, right?
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:47.501]  I mean, we're sympathetic.
[00:58:47.541 --> 00:58:49.822]  We don't like seeing somebody up there struggling like that.
[00:58:49.862 --> 00:58:51.282]  We don't want to see people in that position.
[00:58:51.342 --> 00:58:53.523]  But this is the country's future.
[00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:55.784]  This is our prosperity we're talking about here.
[00:58:55.844 --> 00:58:57.504]  So we have to tell the truth.
[00:58:57.804 --> 00:59:03.186]  John Fetterman is not even capable of having a debate, let alone being in the Senate.
[00:59:03.466 --> 00:59:06.067]  But it's, oh, see, but Steve, you say that.
[00:59:06.187 --> 00:59:07.388]  It's like they had no idea.
[00:59:07.948 --> 00:59:09.750]  How ill he was, but they all knew it.
[00:59:10.330 --> 00:59:12.212]  Notice how they've changed their rhetoric now.
[00:59:12.592 --> 00:59:16.675]  Notice how the rhetoric today and this morning is, look at how brave Federman is.
[00:59:16.735 --> 00:59:21.139]  Look at how he's going up there knowing he'll be humiliated because of the after effects from a stroke.
[00:59:21.179 --> 00:59:21.599]  Wait a second!
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.542]  Two months ago you were saying he was fine and there were no after effects.
[00:59:24.562 --> 00:59:26.663]  Now you're telling us to be sympathetic because he can't talk?
[00:59:27.804 --> 00:59:28.345]  Good night.
[00:59:28.885 --> 00:59:29.406]  Hello.
[00:59:30.286 --> 00:59:30.847]  Federman.
[00:59:31.507 --> 00:59:31.908]  I am.
[00:59:31.928 --> 00:59:32.008]  John.
[00:59:34.887 --> 00:59:39.313]  I, Fracking, and Oz Doctor.
[00:59:40.675 --> 00:59:45.021]  Anyway, uh, what was the next question you had for me in clip J?
[00:59:47.927 --> 00:59:50.070]  One person on this stage has broken the law, we believe.
[00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:57.979]  John Fetterman took a shotgun, chased an unarmed African-American man, and put the gun, apparently, according to that man, to his chest.
[00:59:58.419 --> 01:00:00.181]  John, you weren't pulled over by the police.
[01:00:00.201 --> 01:00:01.203]  They let you go.
[01:00:01.243 --> 01:00:02.304]  You were the mayor at the time.
[01:00:02.404 --> 01:00:08.071]  Why haven't you apologized to that unarmed, innocent black man who you put a shotgun to his chest?
[01:00:08.311 --> 01:00:14.493]  All right, we will allow a 30-second response to that Mr. Fetterman, specifically what he was saying referring to the incident in Braddock.
[01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:20.135]  I had the opportunity to defend my community as the Chief Law Enforcement Officer there.
[01:00:20.535 --> 01:00:28.277]  Everybody in Braddock, an overwhelmingly majority community of black community, all understood what happened.
[01:00:29.498 --> 01:00:30.498]  They understood what happened.
[01:00:31.138 --> 01:00:40.408]  And everybody agreed that and nobody believes that it was anything about me making a split-second decision to defend our community as well.
[01:00:40.729 --> 01:00:41.730]  Why not apologize?
[01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:43.732]  Well, Jack, obviously...
[01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:53.980]  The hypocrisy here is pretty obvious, and as inconsequential as that event may have been, you know the inconsistencies here.
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:01:03.545]  We know the incongruencies with applying that if, let's say, any Republican, let alone Dr. Oz, would have done something similar, that would have been the end of their political career.
[01:01:03.885 --> 01:01:08.688]  But John Fetterman can just say, I did the right thing, black, and he gets away with it.
[01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:15.026]  Well, I mean, look, you know, it's not hypocrisy, though, really.
[01:01:15.287 --> 01:01:15.987]  It's hierarchy.
[01:01:16.427 --> 01:01:26.034]  The idea that a Republican or a conservative can say anything, have their words twisted, have the way you pronounce words twisted, as I've had done to me, they smear who they fear, right?
[01:01:26.094 --> 01:01:32.318]  This has nothing to do with whether or not someone is actually, you know, racist or not racist.
[01:01:32.538 --> 01:01:34.660]  What it has to do is power and control.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:45.549]  Because in order to institute their agenda of total power and total control, they need people that are human sponges, mush minds, like Fetterman, in there in office.
[01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:50.132]  Look what they got in the Oval Office if you need any further indication of that or any further verification.
[01:01:50.453 --> 01:01:54.536]  Because it's not about, this guy isn't the one who's going to be pushing the button.
[01:01:54.576 --> 01:02:06.624]   This guy's not the one that's actually going to be weighing and measuring the limits on abortion, or whether we go to nuclear war with Russia over Ukraine, or what we're going to do in terms of you know, are we doing climate policies,
[01:02:06.624 --> 01:02:07.463]  this, that, and the other thing?
[01:02:07.463 --> 01:02:10.742]   Are we gonna allow AI to take over our world even more than we do?
[01:02:10.742 --> 01:02:16.943]   Are we gonna continue spending and printing money to keep people in global economic slavery, right?
[01:02:16.943 --> 01:02:20.144]   They don't want someone in there that's actually gonna ask questions.
[01:02:20.144 --> 01:02:23.503]   They don't want someone in there that can actually think through these things by themselves.
[01:02:23.503 --> 01:02:29.423]   And what better way than to actually have someone who physically cannot think for himself
[01:02:29.423 --> 01:02:32.603]  unless he's hooked up to a computer that they control?
[01:02:32.603 --> 01:02:34.184]  That's who John Fetterman is.
[01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:35.364]  That's who Joe Biden is.
[01:02:35.364 --> 01:02:36.903]  That's why they're trying to stop him.
[01:02:36.903 --> 01:02:41.664]   That's why they want people that are either, number one, simply gonna be there because they're ambitious
[01:02:41.664 --> 01:02:47.403]   and will say whatever the regime wants, like Josh Shapiro, or someone that they can actually control
[01:02:47.403 --> 01:02:50.302]  at a cerebral level, like John Fetterman.
[01:02:50.302 --> 01:02:54.525]   Steve, let's think about how this applies You had a comment, you can respond to Jack, go ahead.
[01:02:55.587 --> 01:02:56.628]  Hang on, this is key.
[01:02:57.410 --> 01:03:03.919]  Because remember, and I know we'll talk about some geopolitics later in the show, geostrategic initiatives are going around right now.
[01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:05.742]  This is about control of the Senate.
[01:03:06.488 --> 01:03:12.911]  They understand that these four or five seats we're defending, this is the one they thought was the lowest hanging fruit, okay?
[01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:19.873]  They see the Senate slipping away from them and the control of the Senate right now with all the important issues the Senate deals with separate from the House.
[01:03:20.334 --> 01:03:21.474]  This is why it's so central.
[01:03:22.114 --> 01:03:31.641]   And they would go to have a man-machine merger To try to have that up on stage and fool the folks in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
[01:03:32.081 --> 01:03:34.464]  That's what's so shocking, and they got out of it last night.
[01:03:34.504 --> 01:03:40.209]  This is why this thing is so much deeper and more troubling than just a normal Senate race.
[01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:44.573]  One, shifting the entire power of the Senate to MAGA, right?
[01:03:44.593 --> 01:03:48.397]  They're trying to defend it at all costs, and they would do it with a man-machine merger.
[01:03:48.437 --> 01:03:51.100]  They did it with essentially a cyborg.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.063]  And what did they complain about today?
[01:03:53.403 --> 01:03:59.252]  Their first thing they came out with is that, oh, the moderators didn't have the cyborg programmed right.
[01:03:59.553 --> 01:04:04.601]  Because it wasn't, pointing out their lie, Owen, that it wasn't just closed caption.
[01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:06.564]  This is something much deeper.
[01:04:06.944 --> 01:04:22.675]  If you had said a year ago, or if Alex Jones had said it on this very show, that you're going to see a cyber, a man-machine merger, and the entire Senate is going to hang in the balance on one debate where he's up on stage about whether the man-machine merger actually works.
[01:04:23.055 --> 01:04:26.140]  They would have laughed this off as this is more crazy talk from Alex Jones.
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:27.001]  This is ridiculous.
[01:04:27.362 --> 01:04:29.926]  That's what you saw in Philadelphia last night.
[01:04:29.986 --> 01:04:37.758]  It's quite ironic that it's back to the very beginning of American liberty that there you see what transhumanism has in store for the future of us.
[01:04:38.502 --> 01:04:59.308]  Well, and the incredible thing, now we have more of an idea of why there was that kerfuffle over the NBC interview, where he needed multiple machines just to conduct the interview, and the NBC interviewer was like, this is really strange, this is odd, I'm gonna report this as a news story, and they said, oh, how dare you, you're ableist, that's not the case, he's perfectly fine.
[01:04:59.648 --> 01:05:02.269]  But he only had one or two machines to work with him last night.
[01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:04.749]  He needed four or five, and we saw the results.
[01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:07.950]  So, but let's talk about the midterms now, 13 days away.
[01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:12.750]  I want to get the opinion from Jack Posobiec and Steve Bannon, our guests here today.
[01:05:13.671 --> 01:05:14.771]  Is the race over?
[01:05:14.871 --> 01:05:15.991]  I mean, how is it not?
[01:05:16.051 --> 01:05:18.652]  I mean, Federman was such, was so bad last night.
[01:05:18.792 --> 01:05:21.172]  All the polls are indicating that Oz won.
[01:05:21.212 --> 01:05:26.153]  I'm not telling people not to vote, but I'm just saying, I mean, where do you view the race now after last night?
[01:05:27.475 --> 01:05:28.635]  Look, no, no, no, Owen.
[01:05:28.715 --> 01:05:36.018]  I mean, this is just like 2020 all over again because they know when they don't have the candidate, what do they do?
[01:05:36.078 --> 01:05:39.879]  They flip the switch and they begin to fortify the elections.
[01:05:40.179 --> 01:05:49.663]  There was a headline from the Associated Press just today, a few hours ago, talking about this that said, well, you know, there's times where a machine might switch your vote.
[01:05:49.703 --> 01:05:52.424]  There's times where there's some issues, but we're going to work on that.
[01:05:52.664 --> 01:05:55.625]  You got the Department of Justice under Biden putting out these statements.
[01:05:55.725 --> 01:05:59.405]   saying, "By the way, you know, these systems, these critical election infrastructure systems,
[01:05:59.405 --> 01:06:02.125]  they're susceptible to cyber attack. There's many issues.
[01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:03.165]  We've got to look forward to this."
[01:06:03.165 --> 01:06:08.125]   And at the end of the day, the biggest one for specifically Pennsylvania, but a lot of these
[01:06:08.125 --> 01:06:12.525]   states have this issue as well, the United States Supreme Court came out and put out a decision
[01:06:12.525 --> 01:06:16.365]   that said, "Hey, you can't count these ballots if they come in without data."
[01:06:16.518 --> 01:06:20.739]  If they don't come out without the paperwork filled out properly, you cannot count them.
[01:06:20.979 --> 01:06:29.201]  The state of Pennsylvania, which is currently controlled by Democrats, including Josh Shapiro, came out and said, well, that's a nice opinion, Supreme Court, but we're not going to follow it.
[01:06:29.261 --> 01:06:36.003]  You're setting up a constitutional crisis for both of these elections statewide in Pennsylvania, really all the elections in Pennsylvania.
[01:06:36.483 --> 01:06:38.284]  Well, and that was my question.
[01:06:38.104 --> 01:06:43.064]   because they've said they are going to include ballots which the Supreme Court,
[01:06:43.064 --> 01:06:47.064]   the United States Supreme Court has said are illegal. That's how they're going to try to do that.
[01:06:47.064 --> 01:06:51.344]   And that was my question is of course any any common-sense state would not
[01:06:51.344 --> 01:06:55.983]   elect John Fetterman but whether that exists or not the voter fraud exists.
[01:06:55.983 --> 01:06:59.303]  I mean how we did go it's reported that the Republicans...
[01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:02.704]  The Patriots need to show up on game day.
[01:07:02.964 --> 01:07:07.008]  You need to stand in line as long as it takes, as many hours as it takes.
[01:07:07.088 --> 01:07:10.251]  Bring the water, bring your wawa or sheets, provisions, whatever you need.
[01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:12.133]  Stand in line.
[01:07:12.233 --> 01:07:14.536]  Patriots do not step back.
[01:07:14.856 --> 01:07:16.438]  Take no step back, no surrender.
[01:07:16.618 --> 01:07:18.280]  Well, Wawa's are shutting down now.
[01:07:19.021 --> 01:07:24.187]  I want to get Steve Bannon's take on the other side of this because here's the good news.
[01:07:24.247 --> 01:07:32.577]  Apparently, Republicans went from about 250 poll watchers in 2020 to 6,000 heading into the midterm elections.
[01:07:32.617 --> 01:07:33.779]  So, I mean, they're well aware.
[01:07:34.119 --> 01:07:36.341]  We saw them blocking the windows at Philadelphia.
[01:07:36.401 --> 01:07:39.143]  We saw the ballot boxes coming in in the middle of the night.
[01:07:39.203 --> 01:07:41.005]  We saw the vote Viagra for Biden.
[01:07:41.025 --> 01:07:43.987]  He's losing all day and then it goes straight up and then they stop the counting.
[01:07:44.447 --> 01:07:47.310]  How concerned are we about that in the 2022 midterms?
[01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:50.172]  We ask Steve Bannon on the other side of this break.
[01:07:50.212 --> 01:07:50.773]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:07:50.913 --> 01:07:51.753]  It's the Alex Jones Show!
[01:07:52.654 --> 01:07:54.656]  You know, there were other highlights from last night.
[01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:58.260]  The Fetterman Senate debate obviously getting most of the attention.
[01:07:58.320 --> 01:08:04.147]  It's the balance of the Senate and just the example of the cyborg Fetterman that was such an embarrassment.
[01:08:04.567 --> 01:08:08.571]  But Zeldin got Hochul to admit she doesn't care about crime.
[01:08:09.152 --> 01:08:15.451]   Tudor Dixon got Gretchen Whitmer to lie about school closures and lockdowns that received a major
[01:08:15.451 --> 01:08:20.192]   Backlash today, but Steve let's just look at the midterms overall
[01:08:20.192 --> 01:08:22.931]  How concerned are you?
[01:08:22.931 --> 01:08:29.871]   Where we stand because I see all of the the political momentum obviously moving in the direction of Republicans
[01:08:29.871 --> 01:08:35.871]   It really has since 2016 But as in 2020, I'm afraid it's not going to be fairly
[01:08:35.871 --> 01:08:41.520]   represented with the votes Steve Bannon What are you thinking when it comes to midterms and the
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.851]  odds of a Republican victory against all the election fraud?
[01:08:44.851 --> 01:08:49.121]   We know is going to exist Look, right now, we have two things.
[01:08:49.181 --> 01:08:49.921]  Get out the vote.
[01:08:50.101 --> 01:08:51.322]  Everybody's got to man the ramparts.
[01:08:51.362 --> 01:08:56.745]  And also, you've got to sign up and volunteer to be an election official, a poll worker, not just a poll watcher.
[01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:59.567]  It's got to be the Yunkin model in Virginia.
[01:08:59.587 --> 01:09:00.907]  Remember, Yunkin's not our guy.
[01:09:00.947 --> 01:09:02.368]  I know he's not an Alex Jones guy.
[01:09:02.748 --> 01:09:08.331]  But it showed you 100% participation by MAGA plus these suburban moms.
[01:09:08.371 --> 01:09:15.015]  And that's why that segment you did right before I came on, Owen, when I was watching the show about the vaccines is critically important.
[01:09:15.335 --> 01:09:16.876]  That's the thing nobody's talking about.
[01:09:17.276 --> 01:09:18.698]  It's the three I's.
[01:09:18.918 --> 01:09:21.761]  It's immigration, it's inflation, it's injections.
[01:09:22.242 --> 01:09:28.329]  That is what's bringing this coalition together and we know that we're expanding the battlefield, right, on the votes.
[01:09:28.389 --> 01:09:31.292]  Now we've got to figure out how we're going to close on this and not have it stolen.
[01:09:31.573 --> 01:09:32.394]  But look in New England.
[01:09:32.894 --> 01:09:36.337]  In Connecticut, there are two house seats that are totally in play right now.
[01:09:36.377 --> 01:09:36.918]  We could win.
[01:09:37.038 --> 01:09:37.378]  Why?
[01:09:37.799 --> 01:09:40.101]  Suburban Connecticut, the moms up there are furious.
[01:09:40.121 --> 01:09:45.586]  You add a MAGA vote to these suburban moms and dads, the parental rights thing, but particularly about the injection.
[01:09:45.926 --> 01:09:51.091]  They're very silent about it, but they're vocal at the school boards of what they don't want to have happen.
[01:09:51.731 --> 01:09:52.572]  Rhode Island too.
[01:09:53.112 --> 01:09:53.692]  Maine too.
[01:09:54.072 --> 01:09:55.313]  Two seats in New Hampshire.
[01:09:55.653 --> 01:10:02.656]  The Vermont Senate is two or three points away on the Senate seat in Vermont, Bernie Sanders' home state, in New Hampshire.
[01:10:03.056 --> 01:10:04.837]  General Bolduc's almost dead heat.
[01:10:05.157 --> 01:10:07.378]  The Republicans are actually coming back in with money.
[01:10:07.718 --> 01:10:09.659]  New York State, they're 12 to 15 House seats in play.
[01:10:09.679 --> 01:10:10.339]  12 to 15 House seats.
[01:10:13.441 --> 01:10:17.023]  Lee Zeldin, with no money, is in a dead heat with Holko.
[01:10:17.063 --> 01:10:21.427]  Leticia James is two or three points behind Henry, who's had no money to spend.
[01:10:21.967 --> 01:10:26.070]  By the way, one of the House seats in the Hudson Valley is the head of the DCC.
[01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:29.093]  He's the head guy for the strategy and don't let the money.
[01:10:29.333 --> 01:10:32.555]  They just had to put $600,000 into his House seat.
[01:10:32.575 --> 01:10:34.056]  That's never happened before in history.
[01:10:34.377 --> 01:10:35.678]  You look at Washington State.
[01:10:35.958 --> 01:10:37.639]  You got a dead heat there in the Senate race.
[01:10:37.659 --> 01:10:38.920]  You got Joe Kent winning.
[01:10:39.180 --> 01:10:41.222]  You got three House seats in Oregon.
[01:10:41.622 --> 01:10:44.284]  That MAGA candidates right now are on the cusp of winning.
[01:10:44.304 --> 01:10:45.845]  You've got the Oregon governorship.
[01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:48.326]  We've expanded this battlefield all over.
[01:10:48.386 --> 01:10:57.072]  So what we have to do now, Owen, and that's why I think this vaccine thing, CDC gave us a gift, a political gift last week by this unanimous vote.
[01:10:57.472 --> 01:11:00.156]  When they didn't have any debate, they bring up any facts.
[01:11:00.196 --> 01:11:02.679]  I think people are furious about this, about the children.
[01:11:03.099 --> 01:11:05.843]  That is the secret weapon going in to build this coalition.
[01:11:06.303 --> 01:11:13.633]  Everybody in this audience, particularly the Alex Jones Infowars audience, should know the fight we've been fighting for decades against the globalists.
[01:11:13.693 --> 01:11:15.135]  We're right on the cusp.
[01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:24.059]  Of having the opportunity to destroy the Democratic Party as a national political institution from school boards all the way up to the House and the Senate.
[01:11:24.099 --> 01:11:25.399]  And Owen, here's the big tell.
[01:11:25.919 --> 01:11:32.542]  Today in the Hill, the lead story this morning was about how the knives are already out internally at the White House, on the Hill.
[01:11:32.862 --> 01:11:35.464]  They're blaming Pelosi, Hoyer, Clyburn.
[01:11:35.704 --> 01:11:39.866]   The younger progressives saying these people are in their 80s, they didn't get the right You know, issues.
[01:11:40.226 --> 01:11:41.667]  J6 never really mattered.
[01:11:41.987 --> 01:11:43.008]  Abortion played out.
[01:11:43.288 --> 01:11:45.430]  Climate change is not somebody somebody's going to vote on.
[01:11:45.550 --> 01:11:46.210]  It's crime.
[01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:47.131]  It's inflation.
[01:11:48.472 --> 01:11:49.713]  It's the injection.
[01:11:50.093 --> 01:11:52.054]  That's what's playing on people's minds right now.
[01:11:52.314 --> 01:12:05.224]  They said, and here's the number they gave, they said anything 30 seats and above in the House and any flip of the Senate, and that's why Pennsylvania is so big, that immediately all the House and Senate leadership is going to be broomed immediately.
[01:12:05.564 --> 01:12:15.829]   And that Joe Biden, they're going to force Biden to announce In like 24, 48 hours, he's not running again for president because this is a repudiation of his presidency.
[01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:19.771]  Look, this shows so much, number one, Owen, you know this, you can do the math.
[01:12:20.291 --> 01:12:28.014]  No regime could have collapsed this quickly when we had no money if they actually had 81 million votes the first time around.
[01:12:28.354 --> 01:12:30.195]  This proves the case more than ever.
[01:12:30.515 --> 01:12:31.236]  They didn't win in 2020.
[01:12:32.216 --> 01:12:32.557]  Okay.
[01:12:32.957 --> 01:12:37.402]  What we have to do now is an overwhelming show of force everywhere to converge.
[01:12:37.602 --> 01:12:38.183]  Own your vote.
[01:12:38.603 --> 01:12:39.364]  Get out the vote.
[01:12:39.664 --> 01:12:40.605]  Help get out the vote.
[01:12:40.645 --> 01:12:41.286]  Go volunteer.
[01:12:41.747 --> 01:12:42.267]  Phone bank.
[01:12:42.387 --> 01:12:43.148]  Walker Precinct.
[01:12:43.569 --> 01:12:45.951]  And in addition, we have to close the deal.
[01:12:46.011 --> 01:12:48.594]  Remember, in 2020, we won, but we didn't close.
[01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:50.436]  And it's like in mergers and acquisitions.
[01:12:50.556 --> 01:12:52.058]  If you don't close the deal, it doesn't matter.
[01:12:52.498 --> 01:12:55.099]  The way we got to close, and we still got the problems with the machines.
[01:12:55.139 --> 01:12:55.819]  I understand that.
[01:12:55.879 --> 01:13:03.503]  And you see the Wall Street Journal today, the op-eds, or the editorial page, talks about, we still got problems with the mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania.
[01:13:03.823 --> 01:13:04.923]  And these are going to be fights.
[01:13:04.983 --> 01:13:08.124]  But the way you do that, you get into the room and become a poll worker.
[01:13:08.545 --> 01:13:12.046]  This is 100%, Owen, within our hands to grasp.
[01:13:12.406 --> 01:13:13.407]  This will never come again.
[01:13:13.507 --> 01:13:21.390]  We have a unique opportunity to have something like 1932, or right after the Civil War, when you had these massive realignments in American politics.
[01:13:21.870 --> 01:13:24.733]  We could blow these people out of the House and the Senate for a decade.
[01:13:25.154 --> 01:13:25.434]  Okay?
[01:13:25.654 --> 01:13:29.598]  If we pick up 40 or 50 seats, that gets us up to what?
[01:13:29.618 --> 01:13:29.598]  260?
[01:13:30.019 --> 01:13:30.880]  270?
[01:13:30.059 --> 01:13:30.880]  And those guys below 150?
[01:13:31.881 --> 01:13:34.864]  You kill them for a generation because they're going to sit there with no power.
[01:13:35.285 --> 01:13:36.706]  All your great talent's going to leave.
[01:13:36.726 --> 01:13:37.887]  They're not going to sit in D.C.
[01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:40.210]  and just be on a minority in a committee.
[01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.052]  It doesn't work like that because you have no power.
[01:13:42.312 --> 01:13:51.376]  This is our opportunity to destroy the Groomer Party, to destroy the Globalist Party, to back off their Wall Street and their corporate interest, and to go for it.
[01:13:51.396 --> 01:13:53.777]  So that's why I say everything is the next 13 days, sir.
[01:13:54.197 --> 01:14:02.281]  Well, and I actually want to focus on that cause in the next segment, ending what I believe is the biggest hate group and terror group in American history, the Democrat Party.
[01:14:02.321 --> 01:14:07.904]  But I want to get into that with you on the other side, because I know you've dedicated a lot of your effort and work to that.
[01:14:08.504 --> 01:14:17.186]  But getting back to the vote issue, we spoke in the last segment, Republicans went for about 250 poll watchers in the 2020 presidential election.
[01:14:17.206 --> 01:14:18.847]  They've got over 6,000 now.
[01:14:19.507 --> 01:14:24.448]  We have been seeing the stories about, and of course the liberal media is panicked.
[01:14:24.488 --> 01:14:25.548]  They hate poll watchers.
[01:14:25.748 --> 01:14:28.529]  They don't like people watching the mail-in dropbox ballots.
[01:14:28.689 --> 01:14:30.329]  Oh, I wonder why they don't like that.
[01:14:30.389 --> 01:14:31.530]  I think the answer is obvious.
[01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:34.290]  Do you think it's enough?
[01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:37.411]  I mean, do you think it'll back the Democrats off?
[01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:40.752]  Do you think there'll be enough evidence to prove if they do go forward with voter fraud?
[01:14:40.932 --> 01:14:42.332]  I mean, there were two stories today.
[01:14:42.893 --> 01:14:45.793]  Ballots found in Rogue River in Oregon.
[01:14:47.054 --> 01:14:51.375]  Another one here, Georgia mail truck potentially carrying absentee ballots destroyed by fire.
[01:14:51.915 --> 01:14:54.276]  Is this them covering up their crimes?
[01:14:54.356 --> 01:14:55.316]  Is it a coincidence?
[01:14:55.556 --> 01:14:58.837]  I mean, so how do you see that issue solving itself coming up here?
[01:14:59.657 --> 01:15:01.778]  Here's what happened in 2016.
[01:15:02.178 --> 01:15:02.819]  We were prepped.
[01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:04.999]  We were ready to go into court and to fight.
[01:15:05.059 --> 01:15:06.520]  We had people on the ground.
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:13.743]  Remember, we won just by 10,000 votes in Michigan or 10,000 in Wisconsin, 20,000 in Michigan, 40,000 in Pennsylvania.
[01:15:14.123 --> 01:15:16.905]  We were able to fight any kind of protest they had.
[01:15:16.925 --> 01:15:22.764]   right? We were able to close the deal with very thin numbers. In 2020, you know, for whatever
[01:15:22.764 --> 01:15:27.085]   reason, they weren't prepared. And Mark Elias and these guys warned us. They told us exactly what
[01:15:27.085 --> 01:15:32.204]   was going to happen. They walked you through the transition integrity project. They told us how
[01:15:32.204 --> 01:15:35.404]   they were going to steal it with the mail-in ballots. And let's leave the machines off to
[01:15:35.404 --> 01:15:39.484]   our side for a second. We can do this because you're quoting stories right there, Owens,
[01:15:39.484 --> 01:15:41.005]  of people finding it now.
[01:15:41.265 --> 01:15:48.210]  That's why they're in meltdown with guys in CAMI, by the law, with the open carry in Arizona, total asylum citizens.
[01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:51.172]  They're in meltdown, they're in federal court, even as we speak.
[01:15:51.192 --> 01:15:52.573]  They're trying to get that shut down.
[01:15:52.654 --> 01:15:52.934]  Why?
[01:15:52.994 --> 01:15:55.516]  We don't want any more 2,000 mule situation.
[01:15:56.016 --> 01:15:58.617]  That's why the audience, if you see it, report it.
[01:15:58.677 --> 01:16:00.478]  We can't wait till after the fact.
[01:16:00.818 --> 01:16:04.660]  We have to be now to report it all, and you have to be in the counting room.
[01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:08.042]  You have to sit around that green table and argue about every ballot.
[01:16:08.442 --> 01:16:09.583]  That's the way we stop it.
[01:16:09.623 --> 01:16:10.703]  It's not a perfect system.
[01:16:10.823 --> 01:16:12.904]  It worked in the Commonwealth of Virginia with Yunkin.
[01:16:13.324 --> 01:16:14.405]  I think it's going to work now.
[01:16:14.485 --> 01:16:16.406]  We've got to outvote the algorithm.
[01:16:16.546 --> 01:16:17.826]  We've got to outvote the money.
[01:16:18.147 --> 01:16:20.008]  We've got to outvote the corruption and stealing it.
[01:16:20.048 --> 01:16:24.990]  But with this close away, and I think with every patriot in a counting room, we can pull this off.
[01:16:25.566 --> 01:16:32.313]  You know, and another issue, too, with the early voting, you know, Pennsylvania, I think, has already had early voting for a week or so now.
[01:16:32.393 --> 01:16:35.856]  So people went and voted for Fetterman before seeing that disastrous debate.
[01:16:35.876 --> 01:16:36.917]  They probably regret it.
[01:16:36.957 --> 01:16:40.040]  That's why early voting is a problem, especially before any debates.
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:42.623]  But, you know, another thing, I understand why people do early voting.
[01:16:42.663 --> 01:16:44.204]  In fact, I've done early voting myself.
[01:16:44.304 --> 01:16:44.665]  I get it.
[01:16:45.245 --> 01:16:47.506]  Sometimes it's more convenient for you, sometimes it's quicker.
[01:16:47.926 --> 01:16:50.147]  But recall this fact, folks.
[01:16:50.568 --> 01:16:58.331]  If they know how many votes are there before Election Day, if somebody wanted to steal it, they'd know how many votes they'd need to steal it.
[01:16:58.371 --> 01:16:59.792]  Do you really want to give them that ammunition?
[01:16:59.832 --> 01:17:20.920]   It might be worth waiting an extra 30 minutes to an hour on Election Day to cast your ballot instead of doing it early and perhaps giving somebody some intel that they might use All right, when we come back, I want to talk to Steve Bannon about dedicating his work, which I am in complete agreement with, to finally eradicating this country of the cancer known as the Democrat Party.
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:37.885]  Steve Bannon is with us here on the Alex Jones Show, and Steve, you have talked about dedicating a lot of your work, energy, and time into eradicating this country of the cancer known as the Democrat Party.
[01:17:39.164 --> 01:17:40.505]  We're kindred spirits in that.
[01:17:40.685 --> 01:17:43.927]  I have also basically made a formal announcement of the same thing.
[01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:48.891]  My reasoning being the Democrat Party formed out of the ashes of the KKK.
[01:17:49.311 --> 01:18:04.141]  It was then resurrected into cultural political power with the violent terrorists of the Weather Underground to now be introduced as the violent communistic Democrat Party with the violence of Antifa and BLM that it is today.
[01:18:04.841 --> 01:18:14.347]   And with all of that history behind us, how could we not Be looking to eliminate the Democrat Party as a political party from this country.
[01:18:14.447 --> 01:18:17.829]  You laid out how there's a path to that, specifically in these midterms.
[01:18:17.869 --> 01:18:25.374]  But I ask you, Steve, why would you want to dedicate so much of your work, your time, your effort into destroying the Democrat Party despite what we've seen?
[01:18:25.714 --> 01:18:26.955]  It's already cost you so much.
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:32.042]  Well, number one, Owen, you bring up a great point about the Weather Underground.
[01:18:32.202 --> 01:18:35.784]  I come from a working class Irish Democrat family.
[01:18:36.005 --> 01:18:42.288]  I mean, my, from, you know, my dad and my grandfather, everybody were, because Irish came over here, we were just Democrats by birth.
[01:18:42.748 --> 01:18:45.710]  You didn't even consider voting for a Republican.
[01:18:45.770 --> 01:18:52.894]  Jack Kennedy, I remember my brother says, you know what being a Democrat is when he walked precincts for Adlai Stevenson the second time.
[01:18:52.994 --> 01:18:54.415]  It was just something by culture.
[01:18:54.455 --> 01:19:18.805]   And then the Vietnam War came up and you saw these radicals At the universities and particularly the weather underground and they were killing police officers and they were, you know, throwing stuff on servicemen coming back and denigrating the service in Vietnam that these young men had never really had had either been drafted or volunteered to went to go to the, you know, for the defense of their country, what they believe was the defense of their country.
[01:19:19.206 --> 01:19:20.626]  And you saw what the Democratic Party did.
[01:19:20.706 --> 01:19:21.687]  And now it's so radical.
[01:19:21.727 --> 01:19:22.487]  This is why Owen.
[01:19:23.087 --> 01:19:28.054]  The win in 2016, I keep telling people because I had a ringside seat for that, it was totally providential.
[01:19:28.514 --> 01:19:40.169]  I mean, we had a plane, we had a candidate, the greatest candidate since Reagan, we had a set of issues, we had a little bit of money but not much, not much organization, it was self-organizing, and we had Hillary Clinton, the globalist.
[01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:41.549]  As the opposition.
[01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:42.770]  It was providential.
[01:19:42.790 --> 01:19:43.190]  We won.
[01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:48.272]  We saw what going against the administrative and deep state what President Trump had to fight every day.
[01:19:48.332 --> 01:19:55.315]  Then at 20, the steal was also providential because you saw this is not your father's or grandfather's Democratic Party.
[01:19:55.355 --> 01:20:00.798]  We're not arguing about difference in kind of education policy or difference in marginal tax rates.
[01:20:01.658 --> 01:20:05.661]  You know, you're talking about a radical cultural Marxist.
[01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:14.486]  These people are as radical on the family side and the cultural side as Mao Zedong and the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution or during the French Revolution.
[01:20:14.546 --> 01:20:16.947]  Their whole purpose is to destroy the nuclear family.
[01:20:17.368 --> 01:20:20.329]  And they're trying to weaponize the kids to do that.
[01:20:20.690 --> 01:20:32.696]   Whether it's gender ideology, CRT, the mass mandates, and particularly that's what they're trying to do with the vaccines, which was your segment before, which quite brilliantly Talks about the undertones of what this election's about.
[01:20:33.196 --> 01:20:35.356]  In addition, it's a totally globalist party now.
[01:20:35.376 --> 01:20:36.937]  It doesn't represent working class people.
[01:20:36.957 --> 01:20:42.698]  Look, we've shifted the Republican Party in less than 10 years to be a working class, working folks party.
[01:20:42.738 --> 01:20:45.679]  That's why African Americans are not voting for the Democrats.
[01:20:45.719 --> 01:20:47.379]  The Hill newspaper's been all over that.
[01:20:47.679 --> 01:20:49.680]  They've had low turnout in the last couple of days.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:54.659]   to support Democrats. Hispanics in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas are now
[01:20:54.659 --> 01:20:58.339]   flocking to Republicans like never before. We have built a working-class
[01:20:58.339 --> 01:21:03.180]   coalition that is not just populist, it's nationalist. It believes in the
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:06.579]   sovereignty of this country. It doesn't believe in America as an idea, it believes in America as a
[01:21:06.579 --> 01:21:10.779]   nation. A nation with borders, a nation with sovereignty, and most important, a
[01:21:10.779 --> 01:21:15.460]  nation with American citizens.
[01:21:13.811 --> 01:21:21.173]  And we're prepared to step up whether the enemy is in Davos, whether the enemy is in Brussels, the City of London, Wall Street, or our nation's capital.
[01:21:21.533 --> 01:21:22.774]  Prepared to stand up against it.
[01:21:23.054 --> 01:21:27.175]  And that's why the Democratic Party should go the way of the Whigs before the Civil War.
[01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:35.997]   We need to break the back of the Democratic Party, expose their funding, expose their relationship, with the corporations and ultimately sublimate their
[01:21:35.997 --> 01:21:43.217]   relationship with the Chinese Communist Party and other influence peddlers from off our shores, sir.
[01:21:43.217 --> 01:21:50.537]   Well, and you know, if God is still divinely guiding this nation, and we pray that that's
[01:21:50.537 --> 01:21:52.857]  the case, then maybe this was all part of the plan.
[01:21:53.359 --> 01:21:58.223]  Allow the Democrats to steal the 2020 elections, to show the people just how bad it really is.
[01:21:58.623 --> 01:22:04.549]  Allow them to show their lust, their desire for power, and then what they'll do with it from the most sordid...
[01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:26.605]  Political, cultural aspects of the Democrat Party ideology of grooming children, calling it trans kids, calling it drag queen stripper time, to the basic economic policies and energy policies that have crippled this nation to the degree of which most people can't even believe it, with record inflation, record gas prices, the consumer price index, the producer price index.
[01:22:27.486 --> 01:22:28.967]  No, maybe this was all part of the plan.
[01:22:29.007 --> 01:22:31.889]  Yeah, let Biden and the corrupt Biden crime family get up there.
[01:22:31.909 --> 01:22:34.671]  Let them sniff and grope little kids when they come to the White House.
[01:22:34.731 --> 01:22:37.332]  Maybe America really had to see this moment, Steve.
[01:22:37.572 --> 01:22:43.116]  Really had to live in this moment, experience this moment with their own eyes to understand what we need to do to save this country.
[01:22:44.019 --> 01:22:46.260]  Oh, and I think that brings us back to the beginning of the show.
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:49.641]  That's why what happened last night in Philadelphia is so important.
[01:22:49.681 --> 01:22:50.381]  It's ironic.
[01:22:50.762 --> 01:22:55.864]  It happened in the birthplace in the Cradle of Liberty, right there near Independence Hall, right?
[01:22:56.244 --> 01:23:07.508]  In the same city where the great documents of the Declaration and the Constitution were negotiated and signed and brought forth that really set up ourselves as the new Jerusalem.
[01:23:07.908 --> 01:23:08.909]  That's what America is.
[01:23:08.989 --> 01:23:12.570]  America is a divinely inspired country, and we've got to get back to that.
[01:23:12.870 --> 01:23:19.433]  But we had to fight this battle last night for the control of the Senate, what could be the whole shooting match, which they're so in.
[01:23:19.713 --> 01:23:23.635]  They actually had a cyborg, a man-machine merger up there.
[01:23:23.655 --> 01:23:25.055]  You could see it for everything.
[01:23:25.075 --> 01:23:26.056]  They didn't pull it off.
[01:23:26.496 --> 01:23:29.797]  And that's what I think shocked the Democrat, the opposition, the Democratic Party.
[01:23:30.137 --> 01:23:31.298]  It should shock the nation.
[01:23:31.878 --> 01:23:36.759]  There is nothing too low that these people won't do to maintain power.
[01:23:37.059 --> 01:23:38.619]  That's what we're going to see in the next 13 days.
[01:23:38.679 --> 01:23:42.320]  I mean, Alex has warned us about false flags, cyber attacks, everything.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:43.880]  People have to be on watch.
[01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:46.201]  You have to be focused.
[01:23:46.501 --> 01:23:51.902]  The next 13 days should all be about how we take this country back, and we're taking back at the ballot box.
[01:23:51.922 --> 01:23:57.983]  We have to both show up to get the vote out, and we have to both show up to get it on, and we have to secure it.
[01:23:58.443 --> 01:24:00.124]  Well yeah, you gotta have your head on a swivel.
[01:24:00.164 --> 01:24:04.065]  Democrats are not just going to relinquish this power so easily.
[01:24:04.205 --> 01:24:11.027]  And my biggest fear is they now see the power that they truly desire at an arm's length away.
[01:24:11.087 --> 01:24:16.488]  I'm talking about adding a 51st, 52nd state so they can add their votes in Electoral College, rig it that way.
[01:24:16.829 --> 01:24:20.470]  We're talking about amnesty so they can overwhelm the popular vote as well.
[01:24:20.850 --> 01:24:24.250]   I'm talking about ending the filibuster so there'll be no means of stopping
[01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:28.529]   them when they try to write their legislation. They see all of this right there
[01:24:28.529 --> 01:24:32.118]   at an arm's length and that's why I'm afraid the moves that they're gonna make
[01:24:32.118 --> 01:24:36.889]   here with 13 days left till the midterms are going to be paramount. But I
[01:24:36.889 --> 01:24:37.929]  think people see it.
[01:24:37.929 --> 01:24:42.009]   I mean I don't know about you Steve but in my walk of life when I go around when
[01:24:42.009 --> 01:24:45.689]   I talk to people, random people, strangers, friends, family, I don't know anybody
[01:24:45.689 --> 01:24:49.449]  that supports the Democrats right now.
[01:24:47.451 --> 01:24:55.055]  We're talking about lifelong liberals, even Democrat voters, and even they're kind of like, yeah, I don't know if I can support these guys.
[01:24:56.488 --> 01:24:57.069]  I think you're right.
[01:24:57.109 --> 01:25:03.196]  I think, look, they're so over the top what they've done is destroying the economy, what they've done geopolitically, right?
[01:25:03.737 --> 01:25:12.067]  Putting unlimited arms into and money into Ukraine and not really paying attention to Taiwan or the South China Sea or the rise of the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:25:12.367 --> 01:25:16.367]   You see what they've done to capital markets in this country, whether it's 401ks or the
[01:25:16.367 --> 01:25:17.367]  bond market.
[01:25:17.367 --> 01:25:18.967]  You see what you've done to your income.
[01:25:18.967 --> 01:25:20.086]  You see it across the board.
[01:25:20.086 --> 01:25:23.766]   But the most radical thing they've done, if everything they've done to destroy American
[01:25:23.766 --> 01:25:30.186]   life and shut our full spectrum energy dominance, it's what they've done around the family that
[01:25:30.186 --> 01:25:32.947]  exposes their true cultural Marxism.
[01:25:32.947 --> 01:25:35.426]  Because this is what the French Revolution wanted to do.
[01:25:35.426 --> 01:25:40.086]   This is what Mao Zedong attempted to do to the Chinese people, to break the back of Lao
[01:25:40.086 --> 01:25:44.887]   by Xi Jinping, break the back of the family and weaponize the children against the parents.
[01:25:44.886 --> 01:25:49.689]  You're seeing it all right now in real time, but everybody has an opportunity to stop it.
[01:25:49.749 --> 01:25:51.110]  If we don't stop it now...
[01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:52.650]  Owen, it's over.
[01:25:52.950 --> 01:26:00.712]  We have one opportunity, and God has given us this opportunity, Divine Providence, but Divine Providence works through human agency.
[01:26:01.052 --> 01:26:05.113]  And trust me, Divine Providence works through many imperfect instruments.
[01:26:05.373 --> 01:26:11.795]  Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, Tucker Carlson, Alex Jones, yourself, Owen, very imperfect instruments.
[01:26:12.175 --> 01:26:16.576]  But he is definitely working through us, and this is why we have to deliver on November 8th.
[01:26:17.416 --> 01:26:20.298]  I'm starting to get that big game anticipation.
[01:26:20.338 --> 01:26:22.480]  I'm starting to get that big fight feel, folks.
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:32.087]  13 days out from the midterms, and look, we're talking about the greatest country in the history of this planet, offering the most freedom and prosperity than any other country in known history.
[01:26:32.427 --> 01:26:35.369]  And its future of survival, it all is 13 days away.
[01:26:35.409 --> 01:26:36.510]  That's why it's so paramount.
[01:26:36.530 --> 01:26:38.351]  Steve Bannon, great stuff as always.
[01:26:38.391 --> 01:26:39.872]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:26:40.993 --> 01:26:42.234]  Owen, thank you so much for having me.

[01:28:55.314 --> 01:29:04.314]   Alex Jones has been ordered to pay Sandy Hook victims' families nearly one billion dollars!
[01:29:04.314 --> 01:29:07.314]  A billion dollar verdict.
[01:29:07.885 --> 01:29:09.907]  Almost a billion dollars in damages.
[01:29:09.927 --> 01:29:10.708]  965 million dollars in damages.
[01:29:10.728 --> 01:29:11.569]  965 million dollars.
[01:29:11.589 --> 01:29:12.370]  A billion dollars.
[01:29:12.190 --> 01:29:21.789]   of damages. $965 million dollars. A billion dollars. $100 billion dollars. This is actually
[01:29:21.789 --> 01:29:27.029]   a larger warning for other liars and conspiracy theorists in our society and our politics.
[01:29:27.086 --> 01:29:32.930]  It's a rebuke and a punishment that we believe, according to a lot of legal experts, will set this new precedent.
[01:29:33.071 --> 01:29:41.057]  The mother of George Floyd's daughter now filing a $250 million lawsuit against Kanye West.
[01:29:41.257 --> 01:29:45.801]  Kanye West made, quote, false statements about the manner of Floyd's death.
[01:29:46.221 --> 01:29:54.447]  He says the family could sue for intentional infliction of emotional distress, citing the recent Alex Jones trial as an example.
[01:29:55.028 --> 01:29:58.750]  Alex Jones is patient zero.
[01:29:59.071 --> 01:30:00.272]  Take him out.
[01:30:00.492 --> 01:30:01.412]  Now what does this mean?
[01:30:06.048 --> 01:30:09.371]  Lying and conspiracy theory is part of their business model or politics.
[01:30:09.491 --> 01:30:11.513]  Fox News is clearly watching this closely.
[01:30:11.533 --> 01:30:16.619]  They are facing this suit by Dominion Voting Systems for over a billion dollars.
[01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.141]  You heard that right!
[01:30:19.662 --> 01:30:21.304]  Billion with a capital BYE!
[01:30:24.195 --> 01:30:25.176]  This is not a trial.
[01:30:25.437 --> 01:30:27.820]  There was no jury trial in this case.
[01:30:28.040 --> 01:30:29.142]  No judge in U.S.
[01:30:29.162 --> 01:30:32.106]  history has ever told somebody what they can and can't say.
[01:30:32.206 --> 01:30:34.909]  Everybody knows you're supposed to get your day in court.
[01:30:35.029 --> 01:30:39.055]  Yet the one person who is being denied any day in court is Alex Jones.
[01:30:39.275 --> 01:30:40.556]  Alex Jones didn't kill anybody.
[01:30:40.677 --> 01:30:57.494]  You were clear in that you had a change of heart, or you believed that you were wrong, or you believed you made a mistake, which I think is admirable, and I think the fact that they want to browbeat you after that is what is so scary, and I think that people out here would do well, if you're watching, to understand that apologies do nothing with these monsters.
[01:30:57.654 --> 01:31:02.798]  The whole purpose of the First Amendment is to keep the government the hell out of the business of speech.
[01:31:03.298 --> 01:31:09.843]  Totally disregarded by the Connecticut courts when they decided to write their Alex Jones rule.
[01:31:10.104 --> 01:31:17.029]  This judge, Barbara Nellis, is a disgrace to the rule of law, a disgrace to the judiciary, a disgrace to the justice system.
[01:31:17.429 --> 01:31:19.411]  So the regime has come for Alex Jones.
[01:31:19.691 --> 01:31:21.853]  They always start with Alex Jones when it comes to these things.
[01:31:21.932 --> 01:31:28.172]   You don't have to be an Alex Jones fan to understand that he is most definitely being made an example of.
[01:31:28.172 --> 01:31:36.412]   The law industrial complex in collusion with the media can work in harmony to completely obliterate somebody
[01:31:36.412 --> 01:31:37.292]  financially.
[01:31:37.292 --> 01:31:45.292]   That's a billion dollars for expressing an opinion which under the prevailing Supreme Court case law is absolutely
[01:31:45.292 --> 01:31:46.092]  protected.
[01:31:46.092 --> 01:31:53.212]   The question is, do they really care about what Alex Jones said or do they want to destroy Alex Jones?
[01:31:53.212 --> 01:32:01.853]   Do you now believe that the First Amendment is absolute or do you believe that the First Amendment has limitations?
[01:32:01.853 --> 01:32:04.573]  I believe that the First Amendment.
[01:32:04.659 --> 01:32:06.520]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:32:06.540 --> 01:32:08.361]  Most countries don't have that.
[01:32:08.401 --> 01:32:11.783]  I think the United States is the only country that has this, right?
[01:32:11.603 --> 01:32:16.002]  for defamation are liable, then it doesn't have absolutes.
[01:32:16.002 --> 01:32:18.362]  It does have limits, but I wasn't given a free trial.
[01:32:18.362 --> 01:32:20.082]  -The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:32:20.082 --> 01:32:21.082]  Most countries don't have that.
[01:32:21.082 --> 01:32:24.563]   I think the United States is the only country that has this, right?
[01:32:24.563 --> 01:32:28.481]  This enshrined freedom of speech in our highest law.
[01:32:28.481 --> 01:32:29.922]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:32:30.132 --> 01:32:31.572]  This is our rights being taken.
[01:32:31.592 --> 01:32:33.273]  This is a Hollywood production.
[01:32:33.293 --> 01:32:34.813]  I'm not saying Sandy Hook didn't have it.
[01:32:34.833 --> 01:32:39.494]  I'm saying the production of what I supposedly did and how big it became and this huge event.
[01:32:39.554 --> 01:32:40.855]  I'm not the Sandy Hook guy.
[01:32:41.215 --> 01:32:45.796]  I'm the guy that wrote the number one best-selling book in the world, The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:32:46.116 --> 01:32:47.677]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[01:32:47.737 --> 01:32:50.737]  is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:32:50.737 --> 01:33:04.737]   Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:33:04.737 --> 01:33:05.737]  Yeah, yeah, hmph.
[01:33:05.737 --> 01:33:07.737]  Infowars.com, yeah.
[01:33:07.737 --> 01:33:08.737]  [clears throat]
[01:33:08.737 --> 01:33:09.737]  [clears throat]
[01:33:09.737 --> 01:33:10.737]  [clears throat]
[01:33:11.736 --> 01:33:14.778]  If you don't watch it, you're gonna end up like Jason Adderley's boy.
[01:33:16.319 --> 01:33:17.741]  Deal me out this hand, Jason.
[01:33:18.882 --> 01:33:19.922]  I'm about to bust.
[01:33:20.763 --> 01:33:23.025]  Oh, I'm sorry, I thought this was the bathroom.
[01:33:23.045 --> 01:33:23.946]  Oh, good lord!
[01:33:26.048 --> 01:33:33.009]   scanning, control, manipulate scientific data, take over, blast, control world government,
[01:33:33.009 --> 01:33:39.887]   shut down infrastructure, ship everything to China, just look at this person.
[01:33:39.887 --> 01:33:47.408]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:52.849 --> 01:34:03.248]   We are now joined by Greg Manarino, traderschoice.net, and we will be getting into the economic news with him.
[01:34:03.573 --> 01:34:13.155]  And Greg, you know, even let's say we try to put politics aside when we have these discussions about where the U.S.
[01:34:13.175 --> 01:34:18.762]   economy is or where it's going, You try to put politics aside.
[01:34:18.902 --> 01:34:23.703]  Is it not just a universal fact that the U.S.
[01:34:23.743 --> 01:34:32.726]  economy has gotten drastically worse in the last two years with all the things we've seen like inflation, producer price, consumer price?
[01:34:33.286 --> 01:34:34.867]  Again, remove the politics.
[01:34:34.887 --> 01:34:36.787]  You can sit here and point at one side or the other.
[01:34:37.807 --> 01:34:39.588]  That can flesh itself out.
[01:34:39.728 --> 01:34:42.449]  But some people want to act like that's not even happening.
[01:34:42.689 --> 01:34:44.429]  What is the true state of the U.S.
[01:34:44.489 --> 01:34:46.510]  economy right now, Greg Manner?
[01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:50.473]  It's a complete disaster area.
[01:34:50.753 --> 01:34:54.976]  It couldn't possibly be worse, but I can promise you this, it's going to get much, much worse.
[01:34:55.416 --> 01:34:59.939]  This is going to get very, very real for people.
[01:35:00.279 --> 01:35:06.904]  People honestly have no clue as to what is going on, why it's happening to them, the lies, the distractions, the propaganda.
[01:35:07.544 --> 01:35:09.066]  From the mainstream.
[01:35:09.086 --> 01:35:13.089]  What do we want to call these things here?
[01:35:13.309 --> 01:35:18.794]  They're nothing to me, but some kind of a mind twisting program.
[01:35:18.814 --> 01:35:25.260]  That's all they do here is try to convince people that what they're seeing is not real.
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:30.625]  Now this issue, clearly you understand it just by listening to your statement here.
[01:35:30.665 --> 01:35:31.665]  Yeah, it's over here.
[01:35:31.686 --> 01:35:40.631]   The United States economy The economy is in collapse along with the rest of the world here and I don't think it's getting the attention that it deserves here.
[01:35:40.671 --> 01:35:59.722]  We have a major issue and I've been trying for a very long time, years, many years as a matter of fact, to try to raise awareness here that central banks are pushing the world into a global, forget about a depression, we're talking about a meltdown in the debt market.
[01:36:00.722 --> 01:36:03.504]  Very few people on the planet are prepared for.
[01:36:03.544 --> 01:36:05.745]  Let me show you this real quick for everyone that's watching.
[01:36:06.145 --> 01:36:08.787]  This is a headline from Bank of America.
[01:36:09.367 --> 01:36:13.850]  This just came out a couple of days ago that explains what I've been covering for years.
[01:36:14.290 --> 01:36:25.017]  That is that the debt market is a clear and present danger and a meltdown here in the global debt market is going to bring the financial system to its knees by design.
[01:36:25.057 --> 01:36:30.467]   This is what Central Going out of the way to create inflation.
[01:36:30.527 --> 01:36:35.289]  Meanwhile, they are lying to everyone, trying to say, hey, this is a rate problem.
[01:36:35.309 --> 01:36:36.429]  It has nothing to do with rates.
[01:36:36.649 --> 01:36:42.491]  Anyone that follows my work knew from day one, Federal Reserve, Central Bank going to raise rates.
[01:36:42.551 --> 01:36:43.832]  Oh yeah, they're going to fight inflation.
[01:36:43.892 --> 01:36:47.393]  I said it would not work because this is not a rate problem.
[01:36:47.493 --> 01:36:50.094]  I said they could raise rates until kingdom come.
[01:36:50.414 --> 01:36:51.175]  It's not the issue.
[01:36:51.195 --> 01:37:01.067]   The issue here We've been hearing about, okay, we're going to raise the federal funds rate, the overnight lending rate.
[01:37:00.887 --> 01:37:07.527]   with it, the root cause of surging inflation globally, not just here in the United States,
[01:37:07.527 --> 01:37:10.166]  is the fact that currencies are dying.
[01:37:10.166 --> 01:37:11.726]  Has nothing to do with rates.
[01:37:11.726 --> 01:37:16.367]   If central banks, for example, really wanted to slow down inflation,
[01:37:16.367 --> 01:37:18.007]  what have they been doing?
[01:37:18.007 --> 01:37:21.807]   For months now, we've been hearing about, okay, we're gonna raise the federal funds rate,
[01:37:21.807 --> 01:37:23.106]  the overnight lending rate.
[01:37:23.106 --> 01:37:24.847]  This is what central banks have been doing.
[01:37:24.847 --> 01:37:27.487]  Month after month, no result.
[01:37:27.562 --> 01:37:29.225]  Okay, imagine my shock here.
[01:37:30.052 --> 01:37:36.156]  Okay, the issue is a hyper-ballooning money supply issue.
[01:37:36.416 --> 01:37:41.400]  Now, central banks can actually do something about this if they really want to, but they're not concerned at all.
[01:37:41.640 --> 01:37:48.004]  What they could do is have the commercial banks here raise their capital requirements from zero.
[01:37:48.144 --> 01:37:56.130]  In other words, the capital they're supposed to hold in reserve, and that would contract the money supply, and we would see inflation abate very rapidly.
[01:37:56.170 --> 01:38:14.346]   But no, central banks here, in collusion with each other, I mean, honestly, anyone who has taken Economics 101 realizes that a central bank raises rates to do one thing, to crush demand.
[01:38:14.466 --> 01:38:22.214]  It has nothing to do with inflation, but people being duped, as they always are, by the mainstream propaganda ministry, and they're out of control right now.
[01:38:22.614 --> 01:38:23.374]  So absolutely.
[01:38:23.634 --> 01:38:29.097]  We have an economy in free fall and we haven't seen exactly a damn thing yet.
[01:38:29.137 --> 01:38:31.658]  This is going to get very real, very fast.
[01:38:32.018 --> 01:38:43.603]  What is going to, what we're on the cusp of here, I mean, just, you know, looking at headlines like this one from Bank of America is a meltdown in the global debt market.
[01:38:43.643 --> 01:38:47.125]  And what people don't realize, you know, everyone's looking over here at the stock market, okay?
[01:38:47.445 --> 01:38:50.646]  The stock market is not an independent entity of itself.
[01:38:51.127 --> 01:38:58.530]   The stock market, As as itself and globally derives value from what's happening in the debt market.
[01:38:58.550 --> 01:39:03.772]  So the global equity markets are derivatives as to what is happening in the debt market.
[01:39:03.812 --> 01:39:10.134]  Now we are existing underneath a Frankenstein monster that is this global debt bubble is going to burst.
[01:39:10.474 --> 01:39:11.935]  And when it bursts here.
[01:39:12.855 --> 01:39:15.597]  Like I said, it's going to change everything.
[01:39:15.938 --> 01:39:18.399]  The economies of the world are going to lock up.
[01:39:18.439 --> 01:39:19.900]  In other words, there'll be no transactions.
[01:39:20.041 --> 01:39:22.762]  Once the debt bubble pops, what do we have at its core here?
[01:39:23.303 --> 01:39:28.587]  What we have is, on top of all that, is a debt-based economic model.
[01:39:28.867 --> 01:39:29.487]  What does that mean?
[01:39:29.507 --> 01:39:38.596]   That means that every Conceivable idea, reason to pull cash into the now from the future is going to be created.
[01:39:38.897 --> 01:39:48.407]  Wars, expanding wars, this act, that policy, whatever they got to do to continue to pull cash into the now and allow central banks to continue to inflate.
[01:39:52.368 --> 01:39:53.969]  That is their ability to inflate.
[01:39:54.329 --> 01:39:59.491]  If we can take that power away, and we can do it in a nanosecond, I'll outline that in a second, we win.
[01:39:59.631 --> 01:40:00.612]  Otherwise we all lose.
[01:40:00.872 --> 01:40:07.695]  We live under the rule and guide of central banks who run the economy and they run the financial system.
[01:40:07.715 --> 01:40:09.095]  You want to take down a central bank?
[01:40:09.315 --> 01:40:11.016]  I'll tell everyone how to do it right now, real simple.
[01:40:11.416 --> 01:40:14.338]  Prevent them from issuing one single dollar of new debt.
[01:40:14.738 --> 01:40:20.158]   If we could prevent From issuing one dollar, just one, of debt, they implode.
[01:40:20.398 --> 01:40:21.620]  We take back the system.
[01:40:21.940 --> 01:40:24.083]  But you see, people are being distracted.
[01:40:24.364 --> 01:40:25.445]  They're not being told the truth.
[01:40:25.665 --> 01:40:30.452]  That's central banks, especially the Federal Reserve here, a gift from George Gammon.
[01:40:31.129 --> 01:40:33.131]  Public enemy number one.
[01:40:33.471 --> 01:40:44.019]  Okay, we need to end this organization and central banks who are a curse on the world and they are driving the world and its people off of a cliff here very, very rapidly.
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:45.861]  So that's where we stand.
[01:40:46.061 --> 01:40:47.082]  That's where we're going.
[01:40:47.642 --> 01:40:50.084]  And I hope people are ready for what's coming because I don't think they are.
[01:40:50.504 --> 01:41:03.414]   Well, and here's where I kind of see it going and maybe it's both aspects of this or maybe it's one, you know, when they talk about House prices are going down and some people are celebrating this like, oh well, maybe I can afford a house again now.
[01:41:03.955 --> 01:41:08.596]  And they don't even realize, well, you just went from a 2% interest rate to a 6.5% interest rate.
[01:41:08.976 --> 01:41:11.457]  You're actually paying the same price for the house.
[01:41:11.697 --> 01:41:13.877]  It's just a different number, but it's the same price.
[01:41:14.197 --> 01:41:15.438]  They just haven't realized it yet.
[01:41:16.549 --> 01:41:38.070]  But when you talk about the debt bubble and raising rates, so okay, when they raise the rates, how much of that is for say, let's say personal gain, or they're trying to make up their own margins, versus how much of that is to actually collapse the whole thing to centralize the currencies on the planet, or is it both?
[01:41:38.110 --> 01:41:38.631]  What do you think?
[01:41:39.688 --> 01:41:40.228]  Absolutely.
[01:41:40.469 --> 01:41:50.055]  What their goal is here is very simple, and I've been outlining this for probably almost an entire decade, is a move to a completely new system.
[01:41:50.656 --> 01:41:55.439]  Absolutely digital, full control, and that's really what's behind this entire thing here.
[01:41:56.259 --> 01:42:01.883]  And I'm glad you brought up the issue with housing, and most people have no idea of what you just covered just real quick.
[01:42:02.564 --> 01:42:03.985]  And let me just follow that up with this.
[01:42:04.045 --> 01:42:11.510]  Despite the fact that we're seeing this issue here with home prices falling, home affordability is at a record low.
[01:42:11.850 --> 01:42:13.511]  People are being destroyed.
[01:42:13.531 --> 01:42:14.652]  They're being wiped out.
[01:42:14.672 --> 01:42:18.574]  This is an extermination of an entire class of people on a global level.
[01:42:18.874 --> 01:42:23.858]  We're talking about the middle class, a warning I have been screaming from rooftops about for probably a decade.
[01:42:24.578 --> 01:42:27.000]  And it's getting very real, very fast.
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:28.240]  But you know what bothers me?
[01:42:28.821 --> 01:42:30.161]  I don't see the protests.
[01:42:30.442 --> 01:42:31.742]  I don't see anyone in the streets.
[01:42:31.983 --> 01:42:35.384]  They're being distracted, they're being propagandized, they're being lied to and deceived.
[01:42:35.785 --> 01:42:37.166]  And that's really the game.
[01:42:37.506 --> 01:42:40.407]  Keep people in some kind of state of learned helplessness.
[01:42:40.427 --> 01:42:43.549]  They feel like they can't do anything, so they throw up their arms and they surrender.
[01:42:44.250 --> 01:42:47.431]  And then, of course, they're told where to look, what to do, who to love, who to hate.
[01:42:48.152 --> 01:42:51.614]  People's lives are dictated, literally, by the mainstream propaganda.
[01:42:52.153 --> 01:42:55.596]  Well, that's the big issue as we go to break here that I was going to bring up.
[01:42:56.897 --> 01:43:02.061]  I mean, we can we can inject the politics or remove the politics, but the story is still going to be the same.
[01:43:02.461 --> 01:43:11.168]  The mainstream media is protecting the Biden administration right now by not telling you how bad the economy really is.
[01:43:12.029 --> 01:43:19.934]  And it's a direct protection of the Biden administration because they're trying to point the finger at Donald Trump and Republicans and say they're to blame for the economy.
[01:43:19.994 --> 01:43:22.796]  Vote Democrat in November when that's not the truth.
[01:43:23.257 --> 01:43:24.678]  Greg Manarino, our guest.
[01:43:24.918 --> 01:43:27.580]  TradersChoice.net is his website.
[01:43:29.401 --> 01:43:33.844]  So the news we're discussing here, the economic news, is really not debatable.
[01:43:34.861 --> 01:43:37.702]  But why don't you see it in mainstream news?
[01:43:37.762 --> 01:43:39.022]  Why isn't it on the nightly news?
[01:43:39.082 --> 01:43:40.343]  Why isn't it in the weekend reports?
[01:43:40.483 --> 01:43:48.845]  Well, because there is an agenda right now to protect the Biden administration ahead of the midterms, and they don't want any bad economic news out there.
[01:43:49.285 --> 01:43:59.388]  But Greg, no matter how much mainstream media protection of the Biden administration in regards to this news there is, it doesn't change the reality of the situation.
[01:43:59.708 --> 01:44:09.387]   Why is there this blind spot from the American media That, oh, if we just ignore this to protect our political allies, then we'll just be fine.
[01:44:09.947 --> 01:44:16.149]  No, you can ignore the tidal wave, you can ignore the shark about to bite your leg off, it's still going to bite your leg off.
[01:44:16.989 --> 01:44:21.491]  Where is this mentality of, oh, let's just kick this can down the road or ignore it, it won't affect us?
[01:44:22.991 --> 01:44:28.753]  Well, you know, look, I think it's very simple for the mainstream media to keep people in the dark.
[01:44:29.404 --> 01:44:32.186]  To not allow people to understand what's really happening.
[01:44:32.206 --> 01:44:40.130]  And then what they do, it's an incredible thing, seriously, is they tell people that what they're seeing with their own eyes isn't real.
[01:44:40.630 --> 01:44:42.251]  It's an incredible phenomenon.
[01:44:42.291 --> 01:44:46.814]  They're trying to push this already with downplaying inflation.
[01:44:47.034 --> 01:44:48.615]  Okay, oh, central banks are fighting it.
[01:44:48.715 --> 01:44:49.495]  Oh, it's getting better.
[01:44:49.815 --> 01:44:50.136]  Really?
[01:44:50.156 --> 01:44:51.436]  I don't see that at all.
[01:44:51.817 --> 01:44:56.527]   But this is their MO constantly to deflect, to tell you,
[01:44:56.527 --> 01:44:59.407]  oh no, that's not really what's happening.
[01:44:59.407 --> 01:45:02.567]  I don't care what you think you're seeing, it's not true.
[01:45:02.567 --> 01:45:04.766]  This is what's going on.
[01:45:04.766 --> 01:45:06.367]  And that's what they always do.
[01:45:06.367 --> 01:45:09.346]  You see, it's just part of the game that they play.
[01:45:09.346 --> 01:45:15.046]   And unfortunately, they have huge, huge audiences of people who are being literally programmed.
[01:45:15.046 --> 01:45:19.206]   Okay, henceforth why these are called programs and I call it the Tell Lie Vision here.
[01:45:19.206 --> 01:45:26.027]   People sit there and they allow themselves to be kind of brainwashed into whatever
[01:45:26.027 --> 01:45:28.306]  the mainstream media wants to sell them.
[01:45:28.417 --> 01:45:29.758]  This is just a game.
[01:45:30.059 --> 01:45:39.445]   The mainstream media's goal is to twist people's minds, get them to focus on some nonsensical things so they can pull off whatever they want on the other
[01:45:39.445 --> 01:45:43.864]   side. Look, we all know that the mainstream media outlets, all of them are
[01:45:43.864 --> 01:45:49.565]   controlled. They all talk about the same things. Really? Isn't that kind of shocking that every
[01:45:49.565 --> 01:45:53.925]   single mainstream media outlet will have you look over here while something else is going
[01:45:53.925 --> 01:45:58.554]   on, talking about the same stories, the same kind of guests repeating the same stories. They'll
[01:45:58.554 --> 01:46:03.295]   never have a guy like me on. If I were to go on any one of these financial channels,
[01:46:03.295 --> 01:46:06.685]   I mean, they wouldn't know what to do with themselves here because I'm telling people how
[01:46:06.685 --> 01:46:10.585]   it's really working and people can see this for themselves. People know the truth when
[01:46:10.585 --> 01:46:12.805]   they hear it. It's not that hard to understand.
[01:46:12.878 --> 01:46:13.618]  That's what they do.
[01:46:13.678 --> 01:46:14.959]  It's always a deception.
[01:46:15.059 --> 01:46:16.080]  It's a distraction.
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:21.383]  These people are there reading a script, unlike you and I. You and I, we're just going for it right here.
[01:46:21.403 --> 01:46:24.985]  We're telling people what's on our minds and people know that it's real.
[01:46:25.446 --> 01:46:32.470]  But when you've got these mainstream media commentators reading some kind of nonsense script fed to them, well, you know what?
[01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:34.111]  Look, they're out there to do one thing.
[01:46:34.471 --> 01:46:39.431]   to to do people to convince them that things are better than they are in there.
[01:46:39.431 --> 01:46:45.271]   And of course that you know the administration here has and everybody has their best interest
[01:46:45.271 --> 01:46:47.271]  in mind here. Nothing could be further from the truth.
[01:46:47.271 --> 01:46:51.400]   There is an agenda going on here and I personally believe it all stems from central banks who
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:54.871]   control it all. They control the economy, they control the financial system.
[01:46:54.997 --> 01:46:55.717]  It's all I do.
[01:46:55.537 --> 01:46:58.817]  They control the disbursement of information.
[01:46:58.817 --> 01:47:05.537]   They float out whoever they want to to say whatever they want to to get a reaction out of the market here.
[01:47:05.537 --> 01:47:11.417]   And it's so sick to me as a guy who is immersed in the markets to.
[01:47:11.417 --> 01:47:15.256]   I mean, I don't know anybody else who's more immersed in this than I am.
[01:47:15.256 --> 01:47:19.576]   It's all I do. So I understand how it works. I understand the dark underbelly of it.
[01:47:19.576 --> 01:47:23.376]   I realize the distractions, the deceptions, the lies and all of this.
[01:47:23.376 --> 01:47:25.376]  I mean, look, what people need to do is turn that off.
[01:47:25.612 --> 01:47:27.072]  Turn off the mainstream, period, the end.
[01:47:28.233 --> 01:47:39.237]  And realize that by focusing on that, all you're doing is allowing yourself to be programmed, to be propagandized, to, you know, told one thing while the polar opposite is actually true.
[01:47:39.477 --> 01:47:45.359]  And that's a phenomenon that's literally been going on since forever, but it really is reaching a fever pitch right now.
[01:47:45.419 --> 01:47:46.680]  It's pretty bad.
[01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:51.421]  And of course, you know, we've been hearing about the debt bubble for a while.
[01:47:51.441 --> 01:47:53.542]  You know, Donald Trump didn't really help it very much.
[01:47:53.582 --> 01:48:00.844]  If anything, he was, quite frankly, one of the worst for it as far as printing money and adding money and inflating the debt bubble is concerned.
[01:48:00.884 --> 01:48:12.508]  Now, the Biden administration is claiming, they're claiming that they are actually now in a, they have it at a deficit now and they're not, they're not spending money.
[01:48:12.588 --> 01:48:12.828]  Okay.
[01:48:12.968 --> 01:48:14.008]  Well, yeah, you react to that.
[01:48:14.228 --> 01:48:17.169]  Joe Biden, the Democrats claim that spending is at a deficit now.
[01:48:18.177 --> 01:48:20.159]  No, it's an absolute joke.
[01:48:20.519 --> 01:48:26.825]  Joe Biden-Stein, I call him Biden-Stein like Frankenstein or mummy man because he looks like the freaking mummy to me.
[01:48:27.145 --> 01:48:27.886]  He really does.
[01:48:28.527 --> 01:48:32.110]  You know, look, the man, he can't walk and chew gum at the same time.
[01:48:32.130 --> 01:48:34.412]  I think that's pretty obvious to most people right now.
[01:48:34.492 --> 01:48:34.792]  Okay.
[01:48:35.153 --> 01:48:43.859]   But the fact of the matter is, you see, look, what the people can't be told is that The fact that we have a debt-based economic model, okay, that's it.
[01:48:43.959 --> 01:48:50.361]  At its core, this whole thing, every developed nation has a debt-based economic model, meaning the debt must inflate.
[01:48:50.521 --> 01:48:51.342]  It can't stop.
[01:48:51.422 --> 01:48:54.383]  The moment it stops inflating, we implode here.
[01:48:54.883 --> 01:49:00.745]  And, you know, yes, the fact is that what you said about Donald Trump is correct, but at the same time, look at every other president.
[01:49:00.966 --> 01:49:01.946]  They do the same thing.
[01:49:02.286 --> 01:49:10.013]   They must, what presidents cannot tell Well, Sharon, that's what I'm saying is Biden is claiming, let me correct myself, Biden is claiming they're not running at a deficit.
[01:49:10.073 --> 01:49:12.696]  Biden is claiming that in his years they have cut the deficit.
[01:49:13.477 --> 01:49:15.840]  Yeah, how about his other lie that we're not having inflation?
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:16.721]  Did you hear that one?
[01:49:16.861 --> 01:49:18.123]  Inflation is zero.
[01:49:18.183 --> 01:49:18.924]  It doesn't even exist.
[01:49:20.776 --> 01:49:22.437]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:49:22.697 --> 01:49:23.958]  It's impossible to do.
[01:49:24.418 --> 01:49:26.919]  But every president must outspend the last president.
[01:49:26.939 --> 01:49:29.000]  The debt must rise exponentially.
[01:49:29.220 --> 01:49:30.240]  It can't stop.
[01:49:30.581 --> 01:49:41.065]  If we had one fearless leader that would tell people the truth, that this debt-based economic model is a curse upon the world, and because of that, this is why we have wars, expanding wars.
[01:49:41.545 --> 01:49:43.827]  Things like the Inflation Reduction Act?
[01:49:44.247 --> 01:49:44.627]  Really?
[01:49:44.847 --> 01:49:49.610]  So let's see, we're going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars and that's going to reduce inflation?
[01:49:49.770 --> 01:49:52.272]  Why don't we just spend five trillion dollars and then we'll go to zero?
[01:49:52.472 --> 01:49:53.873]  But there is no inflation though.
[01:49:53.913 --> 01:49:59.797]  They tell you there is no inflation, but we need to sign the Inflation Reduction Act to stop the inflation that doesn't exist.
[01:50:00.928 --> 01:50:02.369]  It's, I love that.
[01:50:02.509 --> 01:50:05.992]  You see that this is exactly what I'm talking about, what you just said.
[01:50:06.052 --> 01:50:07.273]  It's just so in our face.
[01:50:07.333 --> 01:50:12.657]  But look, we can expect, unfortunately, that the lies, the propaganda, and the distractions to get worse.
[01:50:13.037 --> 01:50:19.522]  They, right now, unfortunately, we do have an economy that is, it couldn't be worse off, in my opinion here.
[01:50:19.823 --> 01:50:22.765]  People are getting crushed under surging inflation with no end in sight.
[01:50:23.285 --> 01:50:25.147]  And there's no help coming here.
[01:50:25.447 --> 01:50:29.775]   It's only going to get worse, although, What's the media going to do?
[01:50:29.795 --> 01:50:31.036]  They're going to tell you it's not happening.
[01:50:31.257 --> 01:50:32.118]  This is not happening.
[01:50:32.178 --> 01:50:36.283]  They're going to convince you, or try at least, to convince some people that what they're seeing is not real.
[01:50:36.543 --> 01:50:37.525]  It's always the same story.
[01:50:37.565 --> 01:50:38.706]  It's pretty insane.
[01:50:38.766 --> 01:50:42.731]  Alright, we've got Greg Manarino with us here.
[01:50:42.751 --> 01:50:44.173]  When we come back, I want to ask him...
[01:50:45.140 --> 01:50:52.687]  What winners are doing right now, if there's any winners in this economic problem that we're in right now, there always seem to be winners.
[01:50:53.067 --> 01:50:54.108]  What are the winners doing?
[01:50:54.128 --> 01:50:55.289]  We'll talk about that on the other side.
[01:50:55.329 --> 01:51:04.937]  Remember folks, you can be a winner by shopping at InfoWarsStore.com and getting a great price on a great supplement like Vitamin Mineral Fusion, 50% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:51:05.798 --> 01:51:08.160]  I take Vitamin Mineral Fusion every morning.
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:11.662]  It's the drink mix I use to chase down all of my supplements in the morning.
[01:51:11.742 --> 01:51:12.983]  I like to mix it with juice.
[01:51:13.524 --> 01:51:15.185]  It enhances the flavor even more.
[01:51:15.485 --> 01:51:29.155]  And I would suggest, if you're a parent out there and you've got kids at home and you don't like them drinking the processed sugar, high fructose corn syrup drinks, artificial flavor drinks, take those out of the fridge.
[01:51:30.279 --> 01:51:33.121]  Make a nice pitcher of Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:51:33.141 --> 01:51:34.642]  You can mix it with juice or whatever.
[01:51:34.723 --> 01:51:36.424]  Get it nice to where they'll like the flavor.
[01:51:36.544 --> 01:51:37.625]  And have them drinking that.
[01:51:37.685 --> 01:51:38.706]  It'll be healthy for them.
[01:51:39.026 --> 01:51:47.192]  They won't be getting all that processed sugar, high fructose corn syrup, and all the other bad ingredients that come in the canned sodas and the fake fruit drinks.
[01:51:47.793 --> 01:51:50.034]  Get it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:51:50.094 --> 01:51:52.516]  Three days left to get it 50% off.
[01:51:53.257 --> 01:51:55.419]  Greg Manarino is my guest.
[01:51:55.699 --> 01:51:57.560]  TradersChoice.net.
[01:51:57.620 --> 01:52:00.430]   And Greg, I ask you this now.
[01:52:02.432 --> 01:52:03.573]  What are the winners doing?
[01:52:03.593 --> 01:52:05.994]  There's always winners during economic crisis.
[01:52:06.014 --> 01:52:08.617]  There's always winners during economic downturns.
[01:52:09.037 --> 01:52:15.082]  Usually it's the one causing it, but there are others out there that know how to win in these markets as well.
[01:52:15.402 --> 01:52:19.806]  What are the winners doing right now with all the economic volatility and instability?
[01:52:20.226 --> 01:52:21.127]  Greg Manarino.
[01:52:22.368 --> 01:52:24.069]  Well, it's pretty simple in my book.
[01:52:24.269 --> 01:52:26.271]  It's something I've been talking about for many, many years.
[01:52:26.311 --> 01:52:27.652]  What do we realize the problem is?
[01:52:31.144 --> 01:52:35.847]  The global situation and understanding that central banks are not going to stop.
[01:52:35.888 --> 01:52:37.349]  They're on a mission here to inflate.
[01:52:37.369 --> 01:52:47.396]  They're going to continue to inflate and drive the world economy to the ground as they fulfill their endgame here.
[01:52:47.416 --> 01:52:50.018]  And their endgame is pretty straightforward here.
[01:52:50.038 --> 01:52:52.880]  A collapse of the financial system.
[01:52:53.741 --> 01:52:57.864]  And with every collapse comes opportunity here.
[01:53:02.043 --> 01:53:04.844]  against the current hyper bubble in debt.
[01:53:04.844 --> 01:53:09.564]  And you do that very simply by holding a unit of wealth.
[01:53:09.564 --> 01:53:10.684]  What are units of wealth?
[01:53:10.684 --> 01:53:15.802]   In my opinion, and don't listen to anything I'm saying, I want people to do their own research here,
[01:53:15.802 --> 01:53:18.844]  is look, this is my favorite asset on the earth.
[01:53:18.844 --> 01:53:20.722]  This is physical silver.
[01:53:20.833 --> 01:53:21.013]  All right.
[01:53:21.394 --> 01:53:29.438]  Physical gold and physical silver, in my view, they've only been real money for thousands and thousands of years.
[01:53:29.718 --> 01:53:35.362]  And when you have a central banker like Ben Bernanke tell you that these are not real money, you know, of course, the polar opposite is true.
[01:53:36.042 --> 01:53:41.083]  So how this is going to play out is very simple and there's no guesswork involved here.
[01:53:41.583 --> 01:54:04.428]   We have a situation where the global debt is inflating at a staggering pace here and it's got nowhere to go and it can't possibly go anywhere else but get much worse until this whole thing implodes, which is where central banks are leading us to by continuing to hyperinflate the money supply, making sure inflation crushes the middle class, And, you know, that's just the way it's going to play out.
[01:54:04.468 --> 01:54:07.868]  Unfortunately, we're seeing an elimination of a class of people.
[01:54:07.908 --> 01:54:10.529]  Their wealth is being stolen on an unprecedented scale.
[01:54:10.549 --> 01:54:17.090]  It's been going on since the meltdown of 2008 when the Fed jumped in here, started buying all the debt, keeping rates suppressed.
[01:54:17.490 --> 01:54:18.650]  You have an interest earning account.
[01:54:18.750 --> 01:54:21.031]  Even today, you're being robbed blind.
[01:54:21.551 --> 01:54:24.411]  OK, so people are not being allowed to make any money in the market.
[01:54:24.431 --> 01:54:35.751]   So what are you going to do if we realize that ultimately this whole thing is going to the human aspect of this, but if we're talking about it
[01:54:35.751 --> 01:54:39.640]   from the financial standpoint, you need to be in an anti-debt unit, like I said, physical gold,
[01:54:39.640 --> 01:54:40.670]  physical silver.
[01:54:40.670 --> 01:54:43.190]  Now, I want people to do a little homework here.
[01:54:43.190 --> 01:54:48.989]   Look at what's called the Dow, Dow Jones Industrial Average Gold Ratio, and then the Gold Silver
[01:54:48.989 --> 01:54:49.989]  Ratio.
[01:54:49.989 --> 01:54:50.989]  Okay?
[01:54:50.989 --> 01:54:54.390]   With regard to that, you will see why I say, and I've been telling people for years, that
[01:54:54.390 --> 01:54:56.350]  physical silver is the most undivided asset on the earth.
[01:54:56.350 --> 01:54:57.911]  I don't sell this stuff.
[01:54:57.911 --> 01:55:02.230]   I just believe that this is how people can protect their wealth in a meltdown, which
[01:55:02.230 --> 01:55:04.230]  She's gonna accrue in the debt market.
[01:55:03.441 --> 01:55:05.443]  Look, everyone's foot fixated on the stock market.
[01:55:05.683 --> 01:55:06.583]  There's a reason for that.
[01:55:06.864 --> 01:55:12.407]  You've got the mainstream financial channels telling people, look, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, 30 companies, that's all.
[01:55:12.827 --> 01:55:15.009]  But the driver here remains the debt market here.
[01:55:15.069 --> 01:55:16.890]  We've been seeing all this instability lately.
[01:55:17.570 --> 01:55:32.455]  But this did turn around on Friday when they floated out the Fed whisperer to say come December, the Fed may pivot and start scaling back their aggressive rate-raising stance, which has done nothing to stop inflation.
[01:55:32.495 --> 01:55:34.015]  But the endgame is very simple.
[01:55:34.075 --> 01:55:42.936]   An implosion of the financial system on an unprecedented scale globally, and that will cause The yields to spike in an uncontrolled fashion, which we're
[01:55:42.936 --> 01:55:45.536]   witnessing lately, a lot of pressure on the stock market.
[01:55:45.536 --> 01:55:48.976]   Global stock markets are going to sell off very, very rapidly at one point.
[01:55:48.976 --> 01:55:50.576]  Then you're going to see cash move.
[01:55:50.576 --> 01:55:53.655]  It's just going to move from one set of assets into another.
[01:55:53.655 --> 01:56:00.015]   I tell people all the time, when markets drop, cash doesn't grow little wings and fly away
[01:56:00.015 --> 01:56:01.015]  to money heaven.
[01:56:01.069 --> 01:56:03.510]  It just moves from one reality into another.
[01:56:03.550 --> 01:56:23.920]   So in my view, understanding that the debt market is the biggest bubble in the world and the greatest threat to humankind, bar none, as a clear and present danger here, because when this debt market bubble implodes, we're going to have a resource problem on an Believeable scale pandemonium industries are locking up of the financial system.
[01:56:23.940 --> 01:56:27.965]  People are going to just that that will force people to take to the streets.
[01:56:28.025 --> 01:56:33.552]  Of course, then you're going to get the same people that you alluded to who created the problem are going to Institute.
[01:56:33.592 --> 01:56:34.933]  Oh, we have a solution for you.
[01:56:35.334 --> 01:56:38.017]  So to protect your wealth yet again, pretty simple.
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:43.405]  Debt market implosion, pressure on global stock markets, cash will move into commodities.
[01:56:44.646 --> 01:56:48.289]  My favorites are gold and silver because I think they're massively suppressed.
[01:56:48.369 --> 01:56:51.292]  There's been a suppression game going on for many, many years here.
[01:56:52.353 --> 01:56:53.414]  So look, that's what you do.
[01:56:53.975 --> 01:56:55.216]  Become your own central bank.
[01:56:55.115 --> 01:57:01.515]   bet against the debt. This has been what I've told people since day one. Understanding clearly
[01:57:01.515 --> 01:57:06.235]   that this thing is just being fueled out of control by design.
[01:57:06.294 --> 01:57:07.655]  It's not going to stop until it does.
[01:57:07.695 --> 01:57:08.676]  Now, we have clues here.
[01:57:09.037 --> 01:57:11.900]  By watching the global debt market, by following the U.S.
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:19.848]   10-year yield, which is the benchmark, by looking at the relative strength of the dollar or the Dixie, And I have a neat little thing right on my website, TradersChoice.net.
[01:57:19.888 --> 01:57:24.112]  It's called the MMRI, Manorino Market Risk Indicator.
[01:57:24.432 --> 01:57:28.336]  Right now, we just crossed 300, which is extreme risk, on Friday.
[01:57:29.156 --> 01:57:30.337]  We've come down a little bit.
[01:57:30.357 --> 01:57:32.479]  When I first put the MMRI out, it was in Haiti.
[01:57:33.500 --> 01:57:34.501]  It's free to anyone.
[01:57:34.621 --> 01:57:36.203]  Just go over to my website and look at it.
[01:57:37.131 --> 01:57:42.341]  And it's really gauges market risk based on what's happening in the debt markets.
[01:57:42.361 --> 01:57:43.804]  A neat little equation I came up with.
[01:57:43.864 --> 01:57:44.245]  It works.
[01:57:44.766 --> 01:57:46.149]  So look, we don't have to guess.
[01:57:46.329 --> 01:57:47.832]  People don't have to guess when this is going to happen.
[01:57:47.872 --> 01:57:48.654]  We have clues here.
[01:57:50.947 --> 01:57:56.690]  Understand, protect yourself from that standpoint, meaning bet against the dead, become your own central bank here.
[01:57:57.591 --> 01:57:59.672]  Look, but what is our greatest resource?
[01:57:59.712 --> 01:58:02.853]  Look, people who know my work realize what I'm about to tell everyone here.
[01:58:02.994 --> 01:58:05.935]  We, people, we are each other's greatest resource.
[01:58:05.955 --> 01:58:07.056]  We got to support each other.
[01:58:07.096 --> 01:58:09.417]  We got to get together with like-minded people.
[01:58:09.857 --> 01:58:16.141]  Understand that the divide and conquer mechanism being propagated by the mainstream just doesn't work.
[01:58:17.261 --> 01:58:43.786]   You know, we need to come together, all of us, if we we lose, period.
[01:58:43.821 --> 01:58:48.242]  I just happen to know this because I'm interested in precious metals myself and I talk to people in the industry.
[01:58:48.842 --> 01:58:53.343]  There have been major runs of gold in the private sector.
[01:58:53.443 --> 01:58:55.703]  The public sector runs kind of already happened.
[01:58:55.743 --> 01:58:56.844]  China bought up a lot of gold.
[01:58:56.924 --> 01:58:57.864]  Russia bought up a lot of gold.
[01:58:57.884 --> 01:58:58.164]  The U.S.
[01:58:58.204 --> 01:58:58.504]  Treasury.
[01:58:58.544 --> 01:58:59.965]  That run kind of already happened.
[01:58:59.985 --> 01:59:01.365]  That kind of tailed off.
[01:59:01.725 --> 01:59:05.746]  Now the private sector is rushing to get gold, rushing to get silver.
[01:59:06.607 --> 01:59:08.489]  It's hard to actually make a purchase now.
[01:59:08.529 --> 01:59:09.430]  You're going to be waiting.
[01:59:09.751 --> 01:59:14.838]  There's a wait period now to get precious metals, if you're looking to make a big purchase at least, definitely.
[01:59:14.858 --> 01:59:18.323]  And so why is that going on right now?
[01:59:18.383 --> 01:59:22.709]  What are you seeing with the delay and individuals being able to make precious metal purchases?
[01:59:24.264 --> 01:59:40.177]   I've been telling people for years that at one point it's going to be very difficult to acquire these things because these are actually scarce, they're real things and I think, at least I'd like to believe that People are raising their awareness.
[01:59:40.297 --> 01:59:44.920]  They understand what's happening, at least I would really hope that's the case here.
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:56.748]  Most people, unfortunately, don't have a clue, but more people are waking up to the grand plan here, the final solution of central banks, what they're doing, how they're driving the economy.
[01:59:57.128 --> 02:00:10.683]  How inflation is not going to stop, the lies, the transitory, it was temporary, how that got pushed by members of Congress, how it got pushed by central bankers, you know, brain dead President Biden, you know, all this stuff.
[02:00:10.823 --> 02:00:12.545]  It's just it's just not going to stop.
[02:00:12.604 --> 02:00:17.144]   It's a mind screw on an incredible scale, but people are waking up.
[02:00:17.144 --> 02:00:18.644]  So this is why we're seeing this.
[02:00:18.644 --> 02:00:22.804]   Look, I can promise you that anyone that I know that has a few dollars laying around,
[02:00:22.804 --> 02:00:28.004]   well, they have a nice stash already and they've been buying gold and silver for a while.
[02:00:28.004 --> 02:00:33.684]   I've been buying silver since it was eight bucks and gold was like $7.50, maybe even
[02:00:33.684 --> 02:00:34.684]  less than that.
[02:00:34.789 --> 02:00:39.433]  And I haven't bought any in a while, but I intend to maybe buy some more here.
[02:00:39.493 --> 02:00:45.519]  But I've been prepared for this for a very, very long time and people need to get ready and they need to get ready now for an implosion of that debt market.
[02:00:46.004 --> 02:00:52.706]  Yeah, and the one thing that is so obvious, even to a layman just looking at it, you can see the anomaly of the U.S.
[02:00:52.766 --> 02:01:03.569]  dollar, or call it inflation, whatever you want, looking at a chart, it goes straight up, and then you look at a chart for gold or silver, somehow that doesn't actually go up at the same rate.
[02:01:03.649 --> 02:01:04.830]  Why would that be going on?
[02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:08.431]  Why do those prices stay synthetically there while the dollar loses value?
[02:01:08.451 --> 02:01:12.072]  We're asked that, and the debt bubble bursts on the other side with Greg Manarino.
[02:01:13.206 --> 02:01:20.254]  All right, final segment here with Greg Manarino, traderschoice.net is his website.
[02:01:20.274 --> 02:01:27.281]  I want to do one more question on the gold-silver issue before we ask the kind of devil's advocate question about the debt bubble bursting.
[02:01:28.322 --> 02:01:31.179]   Why is it Isn't that interesting?
[02:01:31.199 --> 02:01:32.820]  Let's talk about that a little bit.
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:38.780]   rose with the rate of inflation or why doesn't it properly reflect reflect rather the
[02:01:38.780 --> 02:01:44.710]   Devaluation of the dollar over those times, but gold and silver prices still remain the same. Why does that
[02:01:44.710 --> 02:01:46.039]  phenomenon happen?
[02:01:46.039 --> 02:01:53.838]   Isn't that interesting? Let's talk about that a little bit to truly understand why that mechanism
[02:01:53.838 --> 02:01:57.940]  Plays out the way that it does you have to understand how?
[02:01:59.519 --> 02:02:06.560]   Unfortunately, the price of gold and silver is is is Valued or is calculated
[02:02:06.666 --> 02:02:14.295]  Now, generally, when you're looking at, let's say, for example, you're looking at Apple stock, ticker AAPL here.
[02:02:16.471 --> 02:02:22.073]  The value of that stock is the value of that stock, not the underlying value of, let's say, a derivative.
[02:02:22.453 --> 02:02:24.634]  Now, let's talk about a derivative real quick.
[02:02:24.774 --> 02:02:25.974]  What is a derivative?
[02:02:25.994 --> 02:02:28.195]  When people hear this word, their brain explodes.
[02:02:28.415 --> 02:02:30.676]  It's a very, very simple thing to understand.
[02:02:30.696 --> 02:02:37.638]  A derivative is simply a side bet on an underlying asset.
[02:02:40.416 --> 02:02:46.025]  So the derivative derives value derived derivative from that underlying asset.
[02:02:46.426 --> 02:03:01.748]   Okay, so how they keep the price of gold and silver artificially It's funny that we're talking about this here right now because I just had a long conversation yesterday with a friend of mine on about it.
[02:03:02.208 --> 02:03:13.360]  It's the most poorly understood aspect, I believe, of the entire global financial system and it's going to be the derivative market that really brings the world economy and the financial system to its knees.
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:19.583]  When we're talking about a derivative or something that derives value from something else, there's not just one layer of these things.
[02:03:19.883 --> 02:03:27.887]  There's one side bet and there's a side bet on a side bet and a side bet on a side bet and a side bet on a side bet in both directions, both up and down.
[02:03:27.907 --> 02:03:30.648]  And it's enormous.
[02:03:30.728 --> 02:03:36.190]  And every time you get another side bet off of a derivative, there's more leverage involved.
[02:03:36.251 --> 02:03:38.952]  And what people need to understand is these things don't even really exist.
[02:03:39.212 --> 02:03:40.693]  They're not on the elemental chart.
[02:03:40.773 --> 02:03:46.660]   It's just It's a woozy, it's a wazzy, it's out there.
[02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:47.860]  It's not on the elemental chart.
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:49.621]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:03:49.641 --> 02:03:56.405]  And so understanding that mechanism here, this is how they're able to manipulate the price of gold and silver.
[02:03:56.425 --> 02:04:03.309]  It's not going to stop until it does, until we see actual physical shortages of this stuff, because they can do whatever they want to.
[02:04:03.548 --> 02:04:07.948]   We're talking about adding digits to a screen, removing digits from a screen here,
[02:04:07.948 --> 02:04:11.069]  kind of like how the financial system itself works here.
[02:04:11.069 --> 02:04:13.908]   Creating cash from nothing, this is how central banks work.
[02:04:13.908 --> 02:04:15.668]  It's an incredible situation here.
[02:04:15.668 --> 02:04:18.368]  People don't even understand money.
[02:04:18.368 --> 02:04:19.849]  What is the cash that we have?
[02:04:19.849 --> 02:04:26.768]   I mean, we work to get these things so we can go out and buy,
[02:04:26.768 --> 02:04:29.828]  but these are, they're not even ours, okay?
[02:04:29.828 --> 02:04:32.028]  You go out and you work for these dollars.
[02:04:32.028 --> 02:04:37.069]   These dollars that are issued by central banks here, they're not ours, they own them.
[02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:42.149]   Not only do they own the currency, it's owed back to the issuing central bank,
[02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:44.667]  plus cash that they create out of thin air.
[02:04:44.667 --> 02:04:49.349]   Imagine that kind of a, so these are IOUs, just like how a treasury is, okay?
[02:04:49.349 --> 02:04:54.149]   These are just IOUs, and we owe all of this back to the central banks, never meant to be paid back.
[02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:55.328]  You have to understand that.
[02:04:55.328 --> 02:04:59.668]   It's just meant to be inflated on, and inflated larger and larger and larger and larger.
[02:04:59.668 --> 02:05:01.168]  It's created this incredible monster.
[02:05:01.168 --> 02:05:07.109]   Now, if you were to add in the derivatives market on top of, you know, people look at things like,
[02:05:07.109 --> 02:05:09.748]  for example, the national debt, whatever it might be.
[02:05:10.009 --> 02:05:11.488]  and they look at it at face value.
[02:05:11.488 --> 02:05:15.569]   But if you look at the derivatives on that, it's in the quadrillions.
[02:05:15.569 --> 02:05:17.887]  And the issue is, no one knows how big it is.
[02:05:17.887 --> 02:05:20.208]  It cannot be calculated.
[02:05:20.208 --> 02:05:22.168]  And there's the monster in the room.
[02:05:22.168 --> 02:05:29.328]   And it's gonna implode just like, like people have no idea how bad this is gonna actually
[02:05:29.328 --> 02:05:30.168]  end up getting.
[02:05:30.168 --> 02:05:32.528]   And this is what people need to prepare themselves from every level, you know,
[02:05:32.528 --> 02:05:37.728]   mentally, physically, spiritually, absolutely here, making alliances with people
[02:05:37.728 --> 02:05:40.688]   in their neighborhoods here, realizing where we're going,
[02:05:40.688 --> 02:05:46.529]   how we're being pushed deliberately down a pathway, being literally led to the slaughter.
[02:05:46.529 --> 02:05:47.688]  And this is accelerating.
[02:05:47.688 --> 02:05:49.488]  It's very fast.
[02:05:49.488 --> 02:05:54.328]   And in my opinion, going back to the debt bubble, and I think we're gonna talk a little more about that.
[02:05:54.343 --> 02:05:57.744]  Let me just ask you quickly, though, to try to put a bow on this.
[02:05:59.184 --> 02:06:02.065]  I'm making these numbers up just as an example.
[02:06:02.485 --> 02:06:04.846]  Let's say in 1940 an ounce of gold was $1.
[02:06:07.407 --> 02:06:18.676]  And now you're in the year 2020, and $1 compared to $1 in 1940 is now, say, $0.20, but the ounce of gold is not $0.20, it's still $1.
[02:06:20.618 --> 02:06:21.379]  It's a bad example.
[02:06:21.419 --> 02:06:31.367]  My point is, though, how has the price of precious metals, gold and silver specifically, not properly responded to the rate of inflation or to the rate of the valuation of the dollar?
[02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:42.383]  Well, you know, if you look at what an ounce of gold would buy today and what an ounce of gold would buy back then, you will see that it actually buys the same thing.
[02:06:43.364 --> 02:06:51.348]  But based upon what I was saying earlier, you've got this issue of the hard asset deriving value from the derivative.
[02:06:51.428 --> 02:06:52.129]  It's upside down.
[02:06:53.130 --> 02:07:05.181]  No, it's unbelievable how this works here, how a hard asset, because of the way the derivative is set up, is deriving value from the derivative and it can be rigged and pulled and twisted anywhere they want it to go.
[02:07:05.721 --> 02:07:10.843]   The financial system itself is a farce. It's again, it's not on the elemental chart. It
[02:07:10.843 --> 02:07:11.883]  doesn't exist.
[02:07:11.883 --> 02:07:14.932]  Well, how does actually the financial system itself work?
[02:07:14.932 --> 02:07:20.293]   It works on confidence, confidence, notice the word here, that it will work here.
[02:07:20.293 --> 02:07:23.603]   Central banks are in full control of this thing. They control the economy, they control the
[02:07:23.603 --> 02:07:29.012]   financial system, and they have their puppets that they put in charge of us all by our representatives
[02:07:29.012 --> 02:07:34.021]   that our votes are supposed to count for, which they clearly don't, to look at it for
[02:07:34.021 --> 02:07:38.521]   our best interest. But nothing could possibly be further from the truth here.
[02:07:38.608 --> 02:07:47.795]  And all they're concerned with here, central banks, is to continue to inflate, to issue more debt, to find any reason imaginable, whatever it might be.
[02:07:48.256 --> 02:07:49.377]  And this is the frightening part.
[02:07:49.537 --> 02:07:53.560]  Let me just end off with this real quick, to continue to expand the debt.
[02:07:53.880 --> 02:08:05.049]  If people were to guess for a moment, what is the fastest, easiest, and most simple way to vastly continue to inflate the debt, it would be expanding a war.
[02:08:05.409 --> 02:08:07.371]  No money, no endeavor.
[02:08:08.751 --> 02:08:18.434]  Yeah, and we've already seen that.
[02:08:18.614 --> 02:08:20.414]  Yeah, we've seen that with the Ukraine situation.
[02:08:20.434 --> 02:08:22.455]  They say $6 billion could solve world hunger.
[02:08:22.475 --> 02:08:24.015]  Well, then they give $100 billion to Ukraine.
[02:08:24.255 --> 02:08:25.196]  It's funny how that works.
[02:08:26.656 --> 02:08:30.759]  So let me just play devil's advocate here quickly, because obviously we talk about the financial systems.
[02:08:30.779 --> 02:08:35.182]  You've got kind of the, with the central banks, you've got the mix of corruption and policy causing the problems.
[02:08:35.462 --> 02:08:38.784]  But okay, I've been hearing the debt bubble is going to collapse for years.
[02:08:38.864 --> 02:08:40.465]  I've been hearing the debt bubble collapse.
[02:08:40.525 --> 02:08:42.466]  I've been hearing eminent danger for years now.
[02:08:42.907 --> 02:08:43.427]  Why?
[02:08:43.887 --> 02:08:45.849]  Why should I listen to that concern now?
[02:08:45.969 --> 02:08:47.390]  Why should I heed that warning now?
[02:08:48.376 --> 02:08:49.097]  Because it's happening.
[02:08:49.517 --> 02:08:54.281]  Look at the side effect here of all this money creation is inflation.
[02:08:54.841 --> 02:09:00.506]  And it's going to get much, much worse here, especially when this whole thing, you know, look, we can see it.
[02:09:00.626 --> 02:09:02.287]  It's actually unfolding before our eyes.
[02:09:02.307 --> 02:09:11.254]  There's artificial suppression of rates now since the last meltdown has inflated the global debt multiple times.
[02:09:11.735 --> 02:09:19.742]   And it's starting to manifest itself in The way it's hurting people via inflation, which it was meant to do from the get-go.
[02:09:20.042 --> 02:09:21.504]  So this is just the opening act.
[02:09:21.584 --> 02:09:22.705]  We haven't seen anything yet.
[02:09:22.745 --> 02:09:29.291]  Look, if they really wanted to get a handle on this whole financial situation, they could have taken action years ago.
[02:09:29.632 --> 02:09:33.556]  But what people don't get is this debt-based economic model is dying.
[02:09:33.896 --> 02:09:38.921]  And we're seeing the proof of that by actions of central banks who continue to keep rates suppressed.
[02:09:39.081 --> 02:09:41.560]  You can't just, central banks have no magical power.
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:44.360]   They can't just say, "Hey, we're going to keep rates at this level or that level."
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:46.121]  They have to get into the market and make it happen.
[02:09:46.121 --> 02:09:49.400]  They have to make the cash out of thin air and buy the debt.
[02:09:49.400 --> 02:09:50.760]  That's how it works.
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:52.520]  People have no idea how this whole thing is.
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:52.920]  It works.
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:56.440]   But, and they're desperate right now to keep it afloat for as long as possible.
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:09:57.560]  I don't think they're done.
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:01.989]   They're going to continue to do this until until they suck in every last available person.
[02:10:01.989 --> 02:10:04.590]   What they're trying to do is create more slaves to the system.
[02:10:04.590 --> 02:10:08.849]   The more people that they can get dependent on the system, the easier it is for them to
[02:10:08.849 --> 02:10:12.588]  sell it, a new system to people as they beg for help.
[02:10:12.588 --> 02:10:13.588]  Because that's what's going to happen.
[02:10:13.588 --> 02:10:14.588]  When the system explodes.
[02:10:14.588 --> 02:10:17.389]   Well, see, I think that to me, you just put it, and we're out of time here, I'm sorry
[02:10:17.389 --> 02:10:22.909]   to cut you off, but to me, you just put it on the most relatable level where the way
[02:10:22.909 --> 02:10:26.188]  the American financial system is set up, it promotes debt.
[02:10:26.725 --> 02:10:43.897]  It promotes you to go into debt, and then the financial experts will say, or the bankers will say, well this is a good thing, you should go into debt, you should do this, and then the credit cards on top of it, that's horrible policy, it will always lead to failure, it has caused collapse in the past, and I agree that we're on the verge of another one.
[02:10:45.117 --> 02:10:46.678]  Take Greg Manarino's advice.
[02:10:46.718 --> 02:10:49.259]  Go to his website, traderschoice.net.
[02:10:49.339 --> 02:10:52.440]  Get yourself in a smart position in case of a collapse.
[02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:54.861]  And look, I understand why people leverage debt.
[02:10:55.021 --> 02:10:56.541]  I understand why people take debt out.
[02:10:56.561 --> 02:10:57.542]  Believe me, I get it.
[02:10:57.942 --> 02:11:03.564]  But you got to understand that that's not a smart way to protect your wealth into the future.
[02:11:03.604 --> 02:11:06.045]  So, Greg Manarino, thank you so much for joining us today, brother.

[02:11:35.069 --> 02:11:35.810]  When I host the War Room.
[02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:37.171]  But Maria Z coming up next.

[02:12:55.771 --> 02:13:01.953]  Thank you for joining me on this Wednesday, October 26, 2022 broadcast.
[02:13:02.053 --> 02:13:12.497]  I'm Maria Z guest hosting the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show and reporting to you from the testing ground of the New World Order here in Australia.
[02:13:12.517 --> 02:13:13.317]  And the U.S.
[02:13:13.377 --> 02:13:23.001]   midterms are coming up and I want to give everyone some motivation as to why it is so important to vote And get people with integrity in power.
[02:13:23.441 --> 02:13:26.703]  Steve and Owen were talking about this earlier and it is truly crucial.
[02:13:26.743 --> 02:13:35.306]  We really have to fight in every way that we possibly can with integrity and God does honour those who do things with integrity.
[02:13:35.346 --> 02:13:45.412]   Now I'm saying all of this because what I'm about to share with everyone today is some of the most alarming laws in the world that have been introduced into Australia.
[02:13:45.852 --> 02:13:48.294]  And some of these have already been passed.
[02:13:48.814 --> 02:13:57.520]  And if we don't win against these maniacs, this will come to every single country because Australia is the testing ground of the New World Order.
[02:13:57.980 --> 02:14:00.362]  We are treated like lab rats here.
[02:14:01.042 --> 02:14:06.286]  And I know that the people of America certainly do not want to be treated like lab rats.
[02:14:06.386 --> 02:14:07.146]  No one does.
[02:14:07.546 --> 02:14:12.870]  We are all fed up with these maniac eugenicists doing what they're doing to the whole world.
[02:14:12.910 --> 02:14:17.213]  But we have a bunch of leftists and climate change cultists in power here in Australia.
[02:14:17.273 --> 02:14:33.354]   And since they were selected, not elected, into the Parliament, We've had some insane laws passed in our country, some of the most extreme laws in the world, to the point where they've even made the mainstream media.
[02:14:33.374 --> 02:14:46.045]   So I want to talk to everyone about that and warn everyone and remind everyone to keep an eye out on Australia because Whatever they do to us here, they will do to you in your country if our people don't rise up.
[02:14:46.105 --> 02:14:57.291]  So the first one that I want to talk about is a law called the Monitoring of Places of Detention by the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, OPCAP Bill 2022.
[02:14:57.871 --> 02:15:12.973]   This bill was introduced under the guise of preventing torture and it allows the United Nations to come into our facilities such as mental health wards or prisons And make sure that everyone's being treated fairly there.
[02:15:13.734 --> 02:15:18.079]  That's what they say is the reason why they're allowing the United Nations into our facilities.
[02:15:18.119 --> 02:15:22.183]  But when you actually start reading through the legislation, you see that that's not the case.
[02:15:22.704 --> 02:15:27.530]  And funnily enough, we released this report in August.
[02:15:28.270 --> 02:15:34.812]  On zmedia.com and all of the predictions that I made reading through this legislation came true.
[02:15:35.152 --> 02:15:42.313]  Unfortunately, you know, most people don't have the time to read through pages and pages, hundreds of pages of legislation.
[02:15:42.673 --> 02:15:44.474]  And so this is how they slip this stuff in.
[02:15:44.654 --> 02:15:45.454]  It's unbelievable.
[02:15:45.494 --> 02:15:55.416]  But basically it says that it's a bill for an act to facilitate visits to places of detention and access to information by the United Nations Subcommittee.
[02:15:56.757 --> 02:16:06.330]  It talks about people that get taken for public health reasons to quarantine facilities though.
[02:16:06.710 --> 02:16:12.158]  You know what happened in Australia during the period of the so-called pandemic.
[02:16:12.538 --> 02:16:22.962]  We know that it wasn't a real pandemic, but people were actually taken to these facilities for not complying with things like contact tracing or home quarantine and things of that nature.
[02:16:23.902 --> 02:16:32.766]  The places of detention, of course, like I said, it lists prisons, mental health facilities, and then it talks about public health orders and pandemic orders.
[02:16:33.266 --> 02:16:41.090]  And even lists direction given in the exercise of a pandemic management power and, of course, what they call emergency powers.
[02:16:41.290 --> 02:16:45.932]  And, you know, the agenda with climate change in the future.
[02:16:45.972 --> 02:16:47.433]  Australia's just released this report.
[02:16:47.453 --> 02:16:49.634]  I've been talking about it for weeks now.
[02:16:49.714 --> 02:16:52.235]  It's Australia's pandemic preparedness report.
[02:16:52.901 --> 02:16:58.070]  And we have five separate pandemics that they have identified that are going to hit the whole world.
[02:16:58.511 --> 02:17:04.001]  And they talk about how these are going to be, it's dependent on climate change.
[02:17:04.861 --> 02:17:10.965]  When these pandemics just shift because of human encroachment on animal environments and things like that.
[02:17:11.325 --> 02:17:22.371]  So at any given time, they can say that there's a public health need, there's an emergency because we're impacting the climate, all of these things, and they can do it to us yet again.
[02:17:22.391 --> 02:17:25.353]  And you saw how quickly the people fell for it last time.
[02:17:25.393 --> 02:17:26.574]  They will fall for it again.
[02:17:27.335 --> 02:17:35.906]  The UN has unrestricted access to any part of the place of detention and I'm telling you this has even made the mainstream.
[02:17:35.926 --> 02:17:41.074]  In the next segment we're going to keep talking about that and I'll let you know what the mainstream has to say about it.
[02:17:41.114 --> 02:17:42.596]  We'll be back right after this short break.
[02:17:43.351 --> 02:17:45.353]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:17:45.453 --> 02:17:47.596]  I'm your guest host today, Maria Zee.
[02:17:47.916 --> 02:17:55.224]  We're talking about what the Australian Government has brought in under the guise of preventing torture in quarantine facilities, in prisons.
[02:17:55.564 --> 02:18:07.674]   But what this actually is, is a means for the United Nations to come into quarantine facilities and interrogate citizens And that's actually evidenced in the bill that was introduced into Australia.
[02:18:07.694 --> 02:18:16.518]  It goes on to talk about how the United Nations have unrestricted access to any part of the detention facilities where people might be held under the guise of public health.
[02:18:17.182 --> 02:18:23.583]  It talks about the UN being able to interview any person and also deny them a support person.
[02:18:23.623 --> 02:18:35.125]  So it says that you're allowed a support person, but the United Nations representative has the ability to deny you the right to have that support person present.
[02:18:35.165 --> 02:18:42.606]  So it's a one-on-one interrogation with the United Nations, who we know are serving the globalist satanic cabal.
[02:18:43.186 --> 02:19:03.830]   And I want to say, if this is for your health, If they are there to make sure that you're not being tortured or you're actually there because this is for public health, why would they specifically go to the effort of writing into law that the United Nations have the right to deny you a support person?
[02:19:03.930 --> 02:19:09.080]   If this is for your health, if it's for your well-being, Why would they need to deny you that right?
[02:19:09.481 --> 02:19:16.807]  In fact, it should be a human right here to be able to have that support person present if we're doing everything above board.
[02:19:16.848 --> 02:19:20.911]  But every single person around the world knows that these people are psychopaths.
[02:19:20.931 --> 02:19:23.053]  We know what they did to us over the past two years.
[02:19:23.374 --> 02:19:45.121]   We know how capable they are of producing lies That despite the fact that people see straight through the lies, despite the evidence mounting all over the world of the fact that these people have lied about the safety of these shots, have lied about their efficacy, and have openly gone out killing people with their shots.
[02:19:45.661 --> 02:19:46.321]  And I mean that.
[02:19:46.421 --> 02:19:47.521]  These people are murderers.
[02:19:48.242 --> 02:19:50.122]  Despite all of that, they've still kept going.
[02:19:51.178 --> 02:19:52.801]  Because they don't care!
[02:19:53.141 --> 02:19:57.468]  They will just keep lying to you but people are waking up and for that I am grateful.
[02:19:58.770 --> 02:20:17.134]   We've actually had this reach the mainstream media news and I predicted this back in August when we reported on it and I said This is going to be brought in under the guise of protecting people and protecting their human rights, but that is just a front for the fact that they want to bring this into legislation.
[02:20:17.534 --> 02:20:31.017]  This was introduced into the state of Victoria and it turns out the Daily Mail has actually reported on this and said that there's been outrage as the United Nations shows up for unannounced Australia's prisons for random inspections.
[02:20:31.735 --> 02:20:36.198]  Go to Saudi Arabia instead, they say, where they still put people to death for being gay.
[02:20:36.298 --> 02:20:38.460]  So they're feigning this outrage now.
[02:20:38.500 --> 02:20:39.341]  They're faking this.
[02:20:39.721 --> 02:20:44.785]  It says the UN prison inspectors were sent packing after being denied access to New South Wales prisons.
[02:20:45.265 --> 02:20:49.729]  But then it says that the inspectors left the country for New York after a 12-day Australian tour.
[02:20:49.769 --> 02:20:51.170]  So be warned, Americans!
[02:20:51.890 --> 02:20:59.953]  These so-called prevention of torture inspectors are coming to New York right after they were denied access to some prisons here.
[02:21:00.433 --> 02:21:11.296]  It goes on to talk about the fact that they have suspended plans to look at Australian detention facilities after New South Wales and Queensland, these two states, blocked access.
[02:21:12.503 --> 02:21:27.594]  And it actually mentions here that representatives from the UN subcommittee, and you know they really want to hammer home that they're there to make sure that they're preventing torture, were obstructed from carrying out, listen to these words, their protective mandate.
[02:21:28.274 --> 02:21:29.495]  There's that word mandate again.
[02:21:30.016 --> 02:21:35.562]  Violating the country's agreement or obligations, they say.
[02:21:35.582 --> 02:21:41.608]  So we're now obligated to allow these UN goons into our detention facilities.
[02:21:41.648 --> 02:21:48.155]  And again, I'm telling you, they've specifically written into here quarantine facilities under public health measures.
[02:21:49.796 --> 02:22:00.000]  There's one more alarming thing in this Daily Mail article which actually says that UN inspectors were given access to Commonwealth-run detention facilities but did not specify which ones.
[02:22:00.040 --> 02:22:06.102]  So they have actually been to other Commonwealth-run detention facilities, they're just not telling us which ones.
[02:22:06.522 --> 02:22:19.715]   Now, within the next breath, Another article was released by the mainstream media which said that Queensland is now going to change laws that prevented UN inspectors entering mental health wards.
[02:22:19.775 --> 02:22:24.698]  So they come out with this article, look how the mainstream coordinates to lie to the people.
[02:22:24.738 --> 02:22:29.181]  They come out with an article saying, oh there's been outrage, what are you doing in our prisons?
[02:22:29.541 --> 02:22:37.705]   But then they talk about the fact that there's a mandate Our country has an obligation to the United Nations to let them into our facilities.
[02:22:38.205 --> 02:22:47.028]  And then in the next breath, Queensland goes and changes laws to allow the United Nations into mental health wards, but that's where it starts.
[02:22:47.088 --> 02:22:54.650]  It's all done under the guise of protecting you, under the guise of human rights, just like this insane trans agenda.
[02:22:54.730 --> 02:22:55.970]  Oh, it's about equality!
[02:22:56.291 --> 02:22:57.551]  It's about human rights!
[02:22:57.851 --> 02:23:01.392]  We want to treat everyone fairly and make sure we're all equal.
[02:23:01.812 --> 02:23:06.033]  Meanwhile, they're plotting to lock dissidents up in facilities.
[02:23:06.073 --> 02:23:10.374]  And this is exactly what this is about, and I'm going to prove it to you in the coming segments.
[02:23:10.435 --> 02:23:29.561]   But basically, the delegation's head here has said, Aisha Shijouni Mohammed, has condemned both states for restricting access to UN officials and has said that it is deeply regrettable that the limited understanding of the Subcommittee on Preventing Tortures, again there's that word mandate,
[02:23:30.362 --> 02:23:37.524]  Lack of cooperation stemming from internal disagreements, especially with respect to the states of Queensland, has compelled us to take this drastic measure.
[02:23:38.144 --> 02:23:47.987]  What they're doing at the moment in Australia is they're introducing laws through Queensland because there's some sort of a loophole where this ends up applying to the rest of the country.
[02:23:48.467 --> 02:23:58.130]  And again, I'll prove that to you later on in the show, but it says, they go on to talk about the fact that this looks like either gross incompetence or deliberate obstruction.
[02:23:58.976 --> 02:24:00.477]  This is gross incompetence.
[02:24:00.537 --> 02:24:03.338]  Why aren't we letting the United Nations into our facilities?
[02:24:03.458 --> 02:24:07.439]  My goodness, look at the propaganda and the level of brainwashing here.
[02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:13.242]  And most people will believe it because they think it's for public health and human rights.
[02:24:13.702 --> 02:24:14.422]  It's unbelievable.
[02:24:14.462 --> 02:24:21.525]  Based on what we've heard from advocacy groups, I dread to think what the government might be hiding as they duck and weave these inspections.
[02:24:23.086 --> 02:24:24.146]  And then they go on.
[02:24:24.526 --> 02:24:26.247]  You know, they create this outrage.
[02:24:26.986 --> 02:24:31.649]  They create this outrage in order to justify bringing in tougher laws.
[02:24:32.869 --> 02:24:33.630]  This is what they do.
[02:24:34.010 --> 02:24:45.036]  They create a stir in the mainstream, they create a stir in the people who think that the mainstream serves the good of the people, which is a complete lie because they're working hand in hand with these people to kill you.
[02:24:46.471 --> 02:24:51.815]  And then they buy this stuff and then you get virtue-signalling activists saying, oh, we're going to get involved in this.
[02:24:51.855 --> 02:24:54.557]  We need the United Nations here to make sure that we're safe.
[02:24:55.117 --> 02:24:57.199]  All these poor people with mental health issues.
[02:24:57.219 --> 02:25:00.301]  It's unbelievable how they do it and how they spin it.
[02:25:00.321 --> 02:25:09.590]   But they go on to say that last week's disastrous UN visits Shows the importance of realizing this protection.
[02:25:09.610 --> 02:25:18.135]  They're calling it protection, allowing the United Nations to come in and interrogate citizens one-on-one and deny them a support person.
[02:25:18.175 --> 02:25:19.496]  It is absolutely horrendous.
[02:25:20.176 --> 02:25:27.901]  And it is past time for human rights to be fully protected, including all closed settings in Queensland.
[02:25:28.441 --> 02:25:33.556]   I mean, literally, Two months ago, I warned that this was coming.
[02:25:34.477 --> 02:25:37.401]  That report is up on zmedia.com.
[02:25:38.001 --> 02:25:46.070]  We've also got the Emergency Management Amendment Bill, Temporary COVID-19 Provisions Bill of 2022 that I want to talk to you about.
[02:25:46.090 --> 02:26:03.588]   And again, you know, Most people don't find it interesting breaking down legislation, but while we're distracted, while they're trying to sweep COVID under the rug and call it, you know, oh, well, we just did the best that we could with the information that we had and we had to move at the speed of science.
[02:26:04.729 --> 02:26:08.932]  The most unscientific statement I've ever heard made by these people.
[02:26:10.157 --> 02:26:15.222]  While they're distracting you with that, this is the kind of stuff that they're slipping right under our noses.
[02:26:15.242 --> 02:26:18.565]  And I would caution the people of the United States to watch for this.
[02:26:18.965 --> 02:26:24.810]  Someone should take the responsibility of watching for new bills like this and reporting on it.
[02:26:25.171 --> 02:26:27.433]  Because while people are distracted, this is what they do to you.
[02:26:27.493 --> 02:26:30.876]  But back to this Emergency Management Amendment Bill in Western Australia.
[02:26:31.516 --> 02:26:44.498]   It allows authorised COVID-19 officers Nominated by the Chief Health Officer, which is Dr. Andrew Robertson, who just so happens to have extensive experience working with the United Nations and in a military capacity.
[02:26:45.038 --> 02:26:45.939]  Surprise, surprise!
[02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:48.902]  They don't need a warrant to enter your home.
[02:26:48.922 --> 02:26:52.265]  They don't need proof that you have COVID.
[02:26:53.065 --> 02:26:54.145]  Or any disease.
[02:26:54.465 --> 02:26:56.206]  They just have to have a suspicion that you do.
[02:26:56.506 --> 02:27:13.270]  They can break into your home without any evidence as to why they're there, take your property, seize you, take you to a quarantine facility where you legally, now, according to this legislation, can be forced to submit to a medical procedure.
[02:27:13.310 --> 02:27:15.410]  That, of course, we know includes vaccination.
[02:27:15.951 --> 02:27:24.385]   The Immunization Agenda 2030 document, which you can find online, it's Being published in coordination with The Who.
[02:27:24.786 --> 02:27:27.909]  Plans to vaccinate the world with 500 new vaccines by 2030.
[02:27:28.210 --> 02:27:29.531]  These people aren't going to stop.
[02:27:29.952 --> 02:27:31.894]  I'll see you just on the other side of the break.
[02:27:32.875 --> 02:27:35.138]  We are back live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:35.378 --> 02:27:41.065]  I'm your guest host, Maria Z, coming to you live from the testing ground of the New World Order that is Australia.
[02:27:41.800 --> 02:27:45.502]  I want to talk about the importance of supporting Infowars.
[02:27:45.782 --> 02:27:55.367]  I mean, I haven't been asked to do this plug, but working in independent media, I really understand the need for people to support independent media.
[02:27:55.407 --> 02:28:00.809]  See, most independent media is funded by the people because they serve the people.
[02:28:00.829 --> 02:28:02.330]  We exist for the people.
[02:28:04.691 --> 02:28:13.655]  And this broadcast, InfoWars, has been instrumental in providing a platform for people who are seeking the truth and telling people the truth.
[02:28:13.675 --> 02:28:15.835]  The truth that the mainstream media would never tell you.
[02:28:15.855 --> 02:28:19.757]  So you will never get this crucial information that is literally life-saving.
[02:28:20.517 --> 02:28:21.238]  In the mainstream.
[02:28:21.358 --> 02:28:27.242]  They will hide this from you until their very last breath because they're funded and paid by the globalists.
[02:28:27.623 --> 02:28:29.024]  So please support InfoWars.
[02:28:29.044 --> 02:28:37.891]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com and support your favourite broadcasters whenever you get the chance because the truth reaching you depends on your support.
[02:28:37.911 --> 02:28:41.794]  I want to go back to this Emergency Management Amendment Bill.
[02:28:42.674 --> 02:28:46.597]  Interestingly, it talks about COVID-19 in this bill.
[02:28:46.637 --> 02:28:52.582]   It's a Western Australian bill that was introduced There's been a lot of noise about this one.
[02:28:52.602 --> 02:28:57.086]  See what they did was they ended the temporary emergency powers in the state of Western Australia.
[02:28:57.486 --> 02:29:02.350]  Then they introduced this bill which as it stands is in place for two years.
[02:29:02.670 --> 02:29:04.892]  But they specified COVID-19 in there.
[02:29:04.932 --> 02:29:16.592]   Now my assumption here, I'm making an assumption, is because COVID-19 is the flavour of the day and it's easiest to get away with if they put COVID-19 in And later on just make an amendment.
[02:29:17.072 --> 02:29:21.696]  Say, oh well it's not COVID-19 anymore, it's influenza or it's this, that and the other.
[02:29:21.736 --> 02:29:30.322]  Whatever new disease they decide to concoct in their bio labs where they are creating more and more viruses.
[02:29:30.342 --> 02:29:33.044]  We just saw that article come out of Boston University.
[02:29:33.064 --> 02:29:40.149]  There's also been another one where they have announced that they've created a more dangerous version of monkeypox.
[02:29:40.189 --> 02:29:41.349]  I'll talk about that a little bit later.
[02:29:42.510 --> 02:29:51.576]  But I think that what's happened since we at Z Media made noise about this particular bill in Western Australia, this went around the world.
[02:29:51.636 --> 02:29:58.041]  Let me tell you, we had support from people in the United States, former military sending us videos saying, we stand with you.
[02:29:58.501 --> 02:30:00.002]  People created substacks.
[02:30:01.183 --> 02:30:04.725]  This video of me talking about this legislation was shared on Twitter.
[02:30:04.765 --> 02:30:07.487]  The last time I checked, it was almost 300,000 people had seen it.
[02:30:09.662 --> 02:30:15.851]  And we raised awareness about this to the point where they've actually pulled down the bill from their website.
[02:30:15.871 --> 02:30:16.932]  You can't find it anymore.
[02:30:17.272 --> 02:30:20.196]  We've got copies, thankfully, and we found a link that works.
[02:30:20.617 --> 02:30:28.771]   But they've taken the bill down from the website because of the amount of public pushback That occurred as a result of this report.
[02:30:29.071 --> 02:30:43.759]  So that's just proof to you that the power of independent media in raising awareness about these issues, the mainstream did report on it, but it was nowhere near the truth about this bill and what it actually allows.
[02:30:44.259 --> 02:30:47.201]  And following our report, people were horrified.
[02:30:47.261 --> 02:30:48.562]  It resulted in protests.
[02:30:48.602 --> 02:30:53.404]  It resulted in people going to the front of Parliament and protesting and saying, we will not allow for this.
[02:30:53.745 --> 02:30:55.165]  This is absolutely insane.
[02:30:55.466 --> 02:31:00.528]  And why on earth would we be doing it at this stage, this late in the game, when Biden says the pandemic's over?
[02:31:00.829 --> 02:31:01.809]  Why do we need to do this?
[02:31:02.410 --> 02:31:08.293]  You can find that report, new legislation to force Australians into quarantine and force injections.
[02:31:09.356 --> 02:31:15.039]  I don't know the exact title, but it is on the Z Media channel on Band.Video.
[02:31:16.279 --> 02:31:29.925]  I want to talk about the fact that, you know, maybe they've introduced this bill to distract from the fact that we've actually made changes to the Public Health Act of 2005 as of September 2022, the 7th of September 2022.
[02:31:30.425 --> 02:31:37.789]   And again, this was done in Queensland, which means that It applies to all states.
[02:31:37.809 --> 02:31:47.037]  This is the first time that I'm presenting this information and I'm going to give everyone a brief overview of this legislation and then I'm going to release a detailed report this week.
[02:31:47.057 --> 02:31:48.639]  It'll be up on zmedia.com.
[02:31:48.979 --> 02:31:50.781]  It'll also be up on band.video.
[02:31:50.801 --> 02:32:16.245]   I think the world really needs to see this report and understand the extent of what these people have planned This legislation, I'm repeating, applies to all of Australia and they are writing it in to the law that they can then go and take citizens to these quarantine facilities and forcefully inject them and I'm not even kidding, this is what the law says.
[02:32:16.325 --> 02:32:19.769]  So it talks about notifiable conditions.
[02:32:20.583 --> 02:32:27.626]  In this legislation, and it says, it uses words like declared health services to minimise infection risks.
[02:32:27.686 --> 02:32:43.932]  So basically what it allows for is the chief health officers of whatever state to convert certain health services to quarantine facilities or nominate health services for the purpose of quarantining people.
[02:32:45.092 --> 02:32:49.754]  It talks about protecting children and responding to public health emergencies.
[02:32:50.842 --> 02:32:54.684]  Now, there's so much in here about public health.
[02:32:55.224 --> 02:33:12.152]  We recently had a bill pass in the state of Queensland, which is very, very similar to what Gavin Newsom has just introduced in his state, which basically makes what one Australian doctor described to me on air as it turns doctors into agents of the governments.
[02:33:12.912 --> 02:33:19.395]  They are not allowed to disagree with anything that would undermine public health or public confidence.
[02:33:20.328 --> 02:33:29.995]  In the government's recommended program, I mentioned before that the World Health Organization has released their plan to vaccinate, introduce 500 new vaccines by the year 2030.
[02:33:30.676 --> 02:33:36.640]  I recently interviewed Professor Dolores Carhill and she says we are in the killing years of Agenda 21.
[02:33:37.020 --> 02:33:38.021]  It's between the years 2020 and 2026.
[02:33:40.083 --> 02:33:44.407]  So it's no wonder that they're introducing all of this by that year.
[02:33:44.787 --> 02:33:59.359]  And then Australia's pandemic preparedness plan that they've released in conjunction with CSIRO, who was previously involved or accused of being involved in gain-of-function research in Wuhan and has been involved in weather modification activities in Australia previously.
[02:34:00.228 --> 02:34:03.412]  They want this pandemic preparedness plan in place by 2027.
[02:34:04.273 --> 02:34:08.198]  And what people really need to grasp is that this is a slow burn plan.
[02:34:08.598 --> 02:34:10.681]  They're not going to do it suddenly.
[02:34:11.445 --> 02:34:13.647]  Again, so soon after COVID.
[02:34:14.068 --> 02:34:21.174]  But all of these little things that they're writing into the law right now will enable them to, at the drop of a hat, do it to you again.
[02:34:21.515 --> 02:34:24.117]  So people need to remain involved in this information.
[02:34:24.157 --> 02:34:24.898]  But I will go on.
[02:34:24.938 --> 02:34:28.361]  It gives power to state or local governments.
[02:34:28.622 --> 02:34:33.146]   The Public Health Act of 2005 Last updated 7th of September 2022.
[02:34:33.546 --> 02:34:40.894]  It allows them to remove anything from a place, kill animals and tell people how long they cannot use a place.
[02:34:40.914 --> 02:34:49.422]  So say they decide that your home or your place of residence or your place of work is not safe, for whatever reason they can shut down an establishment indefinitely.
[02:34:51.158 --> 02:34:55.661]  And it says that they have to go to a magistrate to get enforcement orders or warrants.
[02:34:56.522 --> 02:35:09.671]  Essentially, the only criteria of whoever these authorised officers are, that are going and applying for these things, is that they need to just believe that someone will be a risk to public health.
[02:35:10.391 --> 02:35:20.298]  They just need to have reasonable belief that an area could be at risk to a public health emergency or a notifiable condition.
[02:35:21.437 --> 02:35:23.639]  So there's no real evidence required.
[02:35:24.119 --> 02:35:25.100]  They just have to believe it.
[02:35:25.220 --> 02:35:36.347]  And there are multiple places inside this legislation where they've actually allowed for this to be overridden, the need for it to go through a magistrate and the due process.
[02:35:36.688 --> 02:35:39.810]  Because if it's an emergency, they can just go ahead and do it.
[02:35:39.850 --> 02:35:47.195]  They make special note of these notifiable health conditions, which is essentially whatever they define as notifiable, they can make it influenza.
[02:35:48.211 --> 02:35:54.353]  And they've also listed this in the preparedness plan, the Australian pandemic preparedness plan that I keep making reference to.
[02:35:54.973 --> 02:36:00.854]  They've spoken about how influenza is going to be a pandemic driver and we need to be prepared for it.
[02:36:01.775 --> 02:36:05.396]  Talks about the powers of people like contact tracing officers.
[02:36:05.856 --> 02:36:08.357]  And I'll get into that right on the other side of this break.
[02:36:08.397 --> 02:36:09.797]  You don't want to miss this next part.
[02:36:11.434 --> 02:36:13.435]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:13.455 --> 02:36:21.820]  Today we're talking about insane legislation that has been introduced into Australia and we're talking about the Public Health Act of 2005.
[02:36:22.741 --> 02:36:37.048]   Going on from what we were saying before, the contact tracing officers have been given these powers That they only need to reasonably suspect that a person has a notifiable condition or may have been in contact with someone who has a notifiable condition.
[02:36:37.088 --> 02:36:38.869]  It literally says may have been.
[02:36:38.909 --> 02:36:45.393]  So there's no proof required of the fact that this person is actually sick.
[02:36:46.393 --> 02:36:49.054]  And again, they tested this during COVID.
[02:36:49.354 --> 02:37:09.416]   They put a lady named Hayley Hodgson into a quarantine facility Because she was a close contact, even though she was negative, she was a close contact and she breached her home quarantine conditions and therefore she was taken against her will to Howard Springs
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:12.202]  Quarantine facility in the Northern Territory.
[02:37:12.242 --> 02:37:14.784]  This was an example of what is going to happen.
[02:37:14.804 --> 02:37:16.986]  And we see what's happening to the people of China right now.
[02:37:17.326 --> 02:37:19.488]  They're taking them to these quarantine facilities.
[02:37:19.508 --> 02:37:21.390]  They're building more and more of these.
[02:37:21.410 --> 02:37:28.516]  They just announced over $300 million, if I'm not mistaken, dedicated to a new facility in China.
[02:37:28.636 --> 02:37:29.717]  Again, another one.
[02:37:29.837 --> 02:37:30.918]  I mean, look at this.
[02:37:31.318 --> 02:37:32.419]  What do you need?
[02:37:32.539 --> 02:37:35.201]  Something of this magnitude being built now.
[02:37:35.241 --> 02:37:44.986]   Another $300 million For what they're calling zero COVID policy, which we all know is not achievable and it is a lie, a means to control the people.
[02:37:45.086 --> 02:37:49.090]  They are building more and more of these all over the whole world.
[02:37:49.570 --> 02:37:58.460]  And in Australia, it's in this legislation, it says that the chief health officer may order detention if they suspect someone has a notifiable condition.
[02:37:59.264 --> 02:38:08.789]  They're expected to counsel that person on how they're affecting their community by potentially spreading this notifiable condition that they don't even have proof that that person has.
[02:38:09.389 --> 02:38:10.149]  But they don't have to.
[02:38:10.970 --> 02:38:15.852]  If it's an emergency, they don't even have to counsel that person or try and educate them.
[02:38:16.152 --> 02:38:23.316]  And it's interesting that they use the word counsel because this is very reminiscent of 1984 and the re-education camps.
[02:38:26.112 --> 02:38:34.439]  They want to re-educate you about what public health means and re-educate you about how you're putting the community at risk.
[02:38:35.253 --> 02:38:37.134]  By spreading, I don't know, a cough.
[02:38:37.715 --> 02:38:38.415]  It's unbelievable.
[02:38:38.695 --> 02:38:56.827]  It is unbelievable and the reason why they're doing this now and writing this into legislation is because they were so successful over the past two years in fooling the public and my hope and my prayer is that throughout this broadcast people will realise that we can never, ever, ever let them fool us like that again and they will try.
[02:38:57.228 --> 02:38:58.108]  Mark my words.
[02:38:58.248 --> 02:38:58.989]  Play this back.
[02:38:59.509 --> 02:39:06.895]  In a few years time and you will see that they will try this again unless we get a mass awakening happening but it is happening more and more.
[02:39:07.635 --> 02:39:19.604]  Now it says that these Chief Health Officers or Authorised Officers can apply for certain orders such as an initial examination order, a behavioural order or a detention order.
[02:39:19.624 --> 02:39:24.168]  There's different types of orders but essentially they can force you into a medical examination.
[02:39:24.890 --> 02:39:35.559]  They can force you into a behavioural assessment, which obviously includes someone who doesn't believe that this is a notifiable condition or that this is a real pandemic.
[02:39:36.480 --> 02:39:38.702]  You know, they allowed protests.
[02:39:39.881 --> 02:39:45.002]  Well, they didn't even allow them, actually, during the time of COVID, if you were protesting against vaccines.
[02:39:45.402 --> 02:39:51.063]  We had one of the largest protests, I think, in Australian history that was not allowed.
[02:39:51.143 --> 02:40:01.345]  Over 150,000 people turned up in Sydney in July of 2020 to a protest that was not allowed by the government to protest what was happening to us.
[02:40:01.985 --> 02:40:21.358]   And, you know, if the people just resisted more back then, if they didn't get scared by the heavy handedness of the police, They actually came back and said that they were using surveillance technology to look through and analyse mainstream media footage to then go and send fines to people that were at that protest.
[02:40:21.378 --> 02:40:27.660]  But if people stood up against it and kept going, you know, how many more times can they repeat the same tactics?
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:30.901]  We can't be afraid of standing up to tyranny.
[02:40:30.941 --> 02:40:31.681]  We just can't.
[02:40:31.701 --> 02:40:34.942]  There has to be no fear in the fight for freedom.
[02:40:36.380 --> 02:40:40.782]  So, these people can approve orders without the person being present.
[02:40:40.903 --> 02:40:45.585]  So, it also makes reference to people that run away when they know that this is happening.
[02:40:46.145 --> 02:40:51.888]  The fact that they can go and they can get a warrant to apprehend them at wherever they think that that person may be.
[02:40:51.908 --> 02:40:56.610]  A warrant to break into the home of wherever they think that person might be residing.
[02:40:57.210 --> 02:40:58.931]  It's absolute insanity.
[02:40:58.950 --> 02:41:08.070]   And we know that, for example, Israel was using their intelligence database or systems
[02:41:08.070 --> 02:41:12.510]   to monitor people during COVID without their knowledge or consent.
[02:41:12.510 --> 02:41:16.829]   So it's not very hard for them to track people down considering all the technology that we
[02:41:16.829 --> 02:41:17.829]  have in place.
[02:41:17.829 --> 02:41:23.590]   Throughout the document, it repeatedly states that any authorized person can use whatever
[02:41:23.590 --> 02:41:28.230]  force is necessary to achieve the submission of the person.
[02:41:28.230 --> 02:41:35.069]   It uses the word "submission" – whatever force is necessary to get the person to submit.
[02:41:35.069 --> 02:41:37.550]  This is written in the legislation.
[02:41:37.522 --> 02:41:39.844]  I want people to understand the insanity of this.
[02:41:39.924 --> 02:41:41.725]  We have this in our law.
[02:41:43.086 --> 02:41:44.087]  It's unbelievable.
[02:41:44.107 --> 02:41:51.633]  And it makes regular references to the person with the notifiable condition and their behaviour, putting others at risk.
[02:41:51.693 --> 02:41:54.895]  For example, not getting vaccinated.
[02:41:56.656 --> 02:41:59.298]  And again, we know that more vaccines are coming.
[02:41:59.358 --> 02:42:03.782]  This is the biggest moneymaker and depopulation tool that these people have.
[02:42:05.205 --> 02:42:12.090]  Pfizer's putting up the cost after they've added the COVID-19 injections to the child immunisation record.
[02:42:12.110 --> 02:42:33.904]  Pfizer shot up their profits and the cost of their injections because, I don't know, making money off killing kids is apparently fine these days and the mainstream media will support that and these people are disgusting and they will pay for what they've done to humanity, whether it's on this side of heaven or where they're going, which is hell.
[02:42:35.276 --> 02:42:43.640]  It then goes on to discuss how they must explain the details of the medical treatment to the person to give them an opportunity to submit.
[02:42:45.961 --> 02:42:51.764]  Give them the opportunity to submit before they use whatever force is necessary.
[02:42:51.784 --> 02:42:54.365]  Guys, I'm not kidding.
[02:42:55.290 --> 02:43:02.256]  This is in Australian law and it's coming to you if you don't fight back against this.
[02:43:02.296 --> 02:43:07.800]  It also makes reference to what they call reckless spread of a notifiable condition.
[02:43:07.820 --> 02:43:31.401]   And in this section, it actually says that those who recklessly spread by not getting vaccinated aren't committing an offence under this particular section in this legislation, but they are subject to Criminal Code Section 317, which actually says that these people can be imprisoned for life.
[02:43:32.702 --> 02:43:36.966]  So they've made sure to write that special note there into this section.
[02:43:37.046 --> 02:43:39.948]  So I want to spend a bit of time breaking this down.
[02:43:40.869 --> 02:43:51.098]  They've purposely written here that reckless spread, they've alluded to the fact that this does, that reckless spread is attributed to those who have refused to get vaccinated.
[02:43:52.319 --> 02:43:52.519]  Right?
[02:43:53.651 --> 02:43:56.995]  Keep in mind, we're done with COVID-19 now, yeah?
[02:43:57.435 --> 02:43:59.076]  Biden says the pandemic's over.
[02:43:59.417 --> 02:44:08.125]  Australian mainstream keeps telling us that we have to move on from this and Dominic Perrottet, the Premier of New South Wales, is talking about how we need to start focusing on smart cities now.
[02:44:10.327 --> 02:44:12.168]  Unbelievable, shifting our focus.
[02:44:13.490 --> 02:44:19.055]  Meanwhile, the smart cities seek to control every single aspect of our lives.
[02:44:20.165 --> 02:44:27.652]  But this is actually talking about reckless spread, making reference to people that have not been vaccinated.
[02:44:28.252 --> 02:44:42.926]  And it says they're not committing a crime under this part of the legislation, but those who contribute to reckless spread of diseases are referenced under the criminal code, which does allow for imprisonment for life.
[02:44:43.871 --> 02:44:55.040]  For anyone who's been accused and proven of spreading a notifiable condition or a transmittable disease or a dangerous disease, which we know.
[02:44:55.060 --> 02:44:57.782]  They told us COVID was deadly.
[02:44:58.703 --> 02:45:03.546]  They told us that it was easily transmitted from person to person.
[02:45:04.567 --> 02:45:08.170]  I don't know about you, but I attended protests in the middle of lockdowns.
[02:45:08.510 --> 02:45:09.651]  I hugged and kissed people.
[02:45:10.372 --> 02:45:13.114]  I'm not saying that people weren't getting sick.
[02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:15.981]  But the transmission that they told us was a lie.
[02:45:16.461 --> 02:45:20.383]  And it was a lie telling us that these so-called vaccines stop that transmission.
[02:45:20.723 --> 02:45:27.266]  So what makes us think they won't lie to us again, considering it was so effective last time in controlling the people?
[02:45:28.766 --> 02:45:33.929]  And this type of information is literally crucial to your very existence.
[02:45:34.349 --> 02:45:39.568]   This information, if this was in the mainstream, This would be over tomorrow.
[02:45:39.608 --> 02:45:45.332]  The globalist control would be over tomorrow, but these people will never tell you the truth.
[02:45:46.313 --> 02:45:50.716]  Because the mainstream media is complicit in this genocide against humanity.
[02:45:51.137 --> 02:45:53.639]  It is absolutely crucial to get this out.
[02:45:53.659 --> 02:45:54.359]  Share this everywhere.
[02:45:54.379 --> 02:45:55.220]  I'll see you in a moment.
[02:45:56.361 --> 02:46:00.804]  You know, in that ad, Alex just said the threat of the globalists.
[02:46:01.324 --> 02:46:03.766]  And I really want to recap what that threat is.
[02:46:03.846 --> 02:46:14.967]   These people will kill Adults and children without blinking an eyelid, they did it through lies, they did it through propaganda, they did it through fear, and they will do it again.
[02:46:15.047 --> 02:46:24.456]  And I want to reiterate that everything that I've shared with you today about these insane Australian laws is coming for the whole world.
[02:46:25.997 --> 02:46:28.119]  The plan is the same for everyone.
[02:46:28.139 --> 02:46:33.304]  Look how they operated in lockstep last time, and some people would think that some of that was chaotic.
[02:46:34.110 --> 02:46:35.011]  It wasn't chaotic.
[02:46:35.211 --> 02:46:36.713]  It was chaotic on purpose.
[02:46:37.634 --> 02:46:47.003]  They wanted to make it look like they needed a uniform approach next time because the fact that we didn't handle COVID well enough was because too many countries did different things.
[02:46:47.043 --> 02:46:53.009]  The World Health Organization is meeting in secret this week to talk about amendments to the international health regulations.
[02:46:53.270 --> 02:46:54.351]  Thanks for that, Joe Biden.
[02:46:55.683 --> 02:47:13.911]  These people are going to implement this worldwide and while they're doing their plans through the World Health Organization, a treaty or international health regulations amendments, they are planning on superseding your country's constitution and the very laws that we've discussed here today, and I'll recap really quickly.
[02:47:14.432 --> 02:47:23.756]  Forced injections, breaking into people's homes without a warrant, seizing people, taking them to camps that they are building all over the world.
[02:47:24.958 --> 02:47:46.414]  And forcibly injecting them, refusing them the right... UN members interrogating citizens in quarantine camps and counselling them, aka re-educating them about public health so that they can jab 500 new vaccines into everyone in the world and it says no one left behind.
[02:47:46.474 --> 02:47:49.056]  That means they want to jab you all.
[02:47:50.737 --> 02:48:01.693]   Specifically talking about how those Who display dangerous behaviour in not getting vaccinated are referred to in the criminal code that seeks to imprison them for life.
[02:48:01.733 --> 02:48:07.839]  Do we understand the danger of what is coming our way if we don't put a stop to these people?
[02:48:08.860 --> 02:48:10.061]  I'm not understating this.
[02:48:11.314 --> 02:48:12.675]  This is not an exaggeration.
[02:48:12.936 --> 02:48:16.579]  It is written into law and everyone needs to know about this.
[02:48:16.619 --> 02:48:18.020]  The whole world needs to know about this.
[02:48:18.060 --> 02:48:25.427]  So I'm asking whoever is watching this broadcast, when it's posted separately as the fourth hour or send the whole show, the whole show's important.
[02:48:25.527 --> 02:48:25.948]  Everything.
[02:48:29.127 --> 02:48:30.667]  But specifically this segment.
[02:48:31.168 --> 02:48:32.168]  Share it everywhere.
[02:48:32.408 --> 02:48:34.009]  Replay it if you've missed the start.
[02:48:34.249 --> 02:48:38.890]  We're talking about the Public Health Act of 2005 in Australia that covers all states.
[02:48:39.170 --> 02:48:41.911]  They've just amended it as of the 7th of September 2022.
[02:48:42.291 --> 02:48:44.132]  It's over 400 pages long.
[02:48:44.532 --> 02:48:51.474]  I will be releasing a more detailed report on zmedia.com this week and it will be uploaded onto zmedia on band.video.
[02:48:52.074 --> 02:48:53.855]  Please share this everywhere.
[02:48:53.875 --> 02:48:58.338]  It is so crucial for people to know what these maniacs plan on doing.
[02:48:58.558 --> 02:49:03.621]  I cannot believe that we are at the point where they are writing this into law.
[02:49:04.621 --> 02:49:05.582]  It is outrageous.
[02:49:07.143 --> 02:49:08.524]  And I mean, there are no words.
[02:49:08.644 --> 02:49:09.524]  There are no words.
[02:49:09.864 --> 02:49:11.926]  These people want you dead.
[02:49:13.787 --> 02:49:17.809]  Just look at what they've done to Alex Jones through this ridiculous trial.
[02:49:19.687 --> 02:49:23.989]  This is an effort to silence free speech, but it's an example.
[02:49:24.749 --> 02:49:31.412]  It's an example through the current methods that they have, which is, you know, phony cases in court.
[02:49:33.333 --> 02:49:43.378]  Meanwhile, they're writing into legislation that they can take you by force and forcibly inject you in these places because you are a threat to so-called public health.
[02:49:45.882 --> 02:49:51.764]  And meanwhile, while they're doing all of this, they're also talking about liquefying human corpses in different places.
[02:49:51.784 --> 02:49:57.106]  We've got an example from Washington State, which legalized flesh goo, essentially.
[02:49:57.126 --> 02:50:05.849]  It's a mechanism for liquefying human corpses known as alkaline hydrolysis.
[02:50:05.909 --> 02:50:07.130]  Many of you would have heard of this.
[02:50:07.890 --> 02:50:10.231]  It went into effect, I believe, on May 1st, 2020.
[02:50:11.983 --> 02:50:22.311]  The law is RCW 68.50.110 and the passage refers to alkaline hydrolysis as the new legal means to dispose of human corpses.
[02:50:24.113 --> 02:50:36.743]  Washington State has developed this method to dispose of large masses of human bodies without having to dig mass graves or run incinerators, which would be detectable by drones.
[02:50:37.964 --> 02:50:41.267]  But I'm not, I'm not, it's not just Washington State that's done this.
[02:50:42.265 --> 02:50:49.187]  In the state of Queensland, Whitsunday Funerals in Mackay has applied to build the Gentle Way cremator.
[02:50:49.787 --> 02:50:50.867]  The Gentle Way.
[02:50:51.487 --> 02:50:53.068]  Listen to how they word this.
[02:50:53.648 --> 02:50:54.468]  It's unbelievable.
[02:50:54.548 --> 02:51:05.290]  And what they're saying is after an application to build a traditional crematorium was rejected, a Queensland undertaker has lodged a new zero emissions plan to dissolve the departed.
[02:51:05.330 --> 02:51:08.011]  Zero emissions, of course, because this is good for climate change.
[02:51:08.812 --> 02:51:15.960]  Which is the new religion that they have introduced into the world for the good of Mother Earth or whatever the heck these people say.
[02:51:15.980 --> 02:51:28.673]   They're talking about this being environmentally friendly and any waste or emissions This new technology does not result in any waste or emissions.
[02:51:28.733 --> 02:51:32.916]  So again, really hammering home that this is good for the climate if they do this.
[02:51:33.256 --> 02:51:39.200]  This is going to stop emissions of cremating bodies.
[02:51:39.260 --> 02:51:41.602]  So let's just liquefy the human corpses.
[02:51:41.642 --> 02:51:42.502]  But why are they doing this?
[02:51:42.522 --> 02:51:43.583]  We'll go into that in a minute.
[02:51:44.123 --> 02:51:49.087]  There's actually a photo on that article, if the team can bring up the second photo that I sent through.
[02:51:49.107 --> 02:51:50.528]  It is so dystopian.
[02:51:51.229 --> 02:51:54.159]  It is unbelievable what these facilities look like.
[02:51:54.179 --> 02:51:57.711]  I mean, I look at it and I'm terrified.
[02:51:58.519 --> 02:52:00.059]  Hopefully we get that photo up very soon.
[02:52:00.099 --> 02:52:08.242]  There it is for everyone to see the new environmentally friendly way to liquefy human corpses coming to the state of Queensland.
[02:52:08.282 --> 02:52:13.923]  Of course, the state of Queensland first and foremost, because that's how they slip everything else through.
[02:52:13.963 --> 02:52:20.645]  California Governor Gavin Newsom signs law allowing human bodies to be turned into garden soil.
[02:52:20.665 --> 02:52:24.686]  That article was posted on the 20th of September.
[02:52:25.887 --> 02:52:33.978]  I believe the legislation is AB351, which permits residents to select to have their remains composted after they die.
[02:52:34.747 --> 02:52:37.750]  This is enabled by the year 2027.
[02:52:37.790 --> 02:52:39.271]  Again, it's that key year of 2027.
[02:52:39.351 --> 02:52:56.025]  The Australian Pandemic Preparedness Plan says that we need to put these systems and measures in place by 2027, which, by the way, include collecting samples from human beings, so probably your DNA, regular monitoring and testing, so preemptively testing.
[02:52:56.645 --> 02:53:04.971]  No doubt using a faulty PCR that will produce the result of whatever so-called disease they're going to come up with.
[02:53:05.911 --> 02:53:07.873]  They'll just do what they did with COVID last time.
[02:53:07.913 --> 02:53:19.941]  They'll, you know, the PCR, they'll run it at a higher cycle than what it's supposed to be run at and it'll detect whatever they want to be detected and they will create a new public health emergency the same way that they did last time.
[02:53:20.721 --> 02:53:26.105]  And of course, you know, we really need to talk about what sort of a precedent this sort of stuff sets.
[02:53:27.250 --> 02:53:36.998]  When you put these things into legislation, allowing human bodies to be turned into garden soil for the sake of climate change, I mean, I'm disgusted by this.
[02:53:37.038 --> 02:53:39.400]  I'm sure that anyone watching is disgusted by this.
[02:53:40.581 --> 02:53:43.683]  But it's the same thing as, you know, bake the cake.
[02:53:44.684 --> 02:53:48.527]  Just bake the cake and everything will be OK.
[02:53:48.567 --> 02:53:50.128]  Don't stand up for your beliefs.
[02:53:50.488 --> 02:53:54.952]  Don't stand up for your religious freedom to say, no, actually, that violates my conscience.
[02:53:55.012 --> 02:53:56.173]  I'm not OK with this.
[02:53:57.045 --> 02:53:58.327]  Please go see someone else.
[02:53:58.367 --> 02:54:01.912]  I'm sure there's someone out there who would be willing to bake the cake for you.
[02:54:01.952 --> 02:54:10.464]  I'm sure that people watching know what I'm talking about, but a few years ago, in case you don't, there was a couple that asked a bakery to make them a cake.
[02:54:10.504 --> 02:54:13.589]  They were a same-sex couple getting married and the bakery didn't want to do it.
[02:54:15.012 --> 02:54:27.623]  And rightfully so, because if it violates your conscience, you should have the right to say, I'm so sorry, this is a violation of my conscience and my religion, I can't do this for you, but just go see Tom down the road, he'll do it for you.
[02:54:28.103 --> 02:54:28.624]  But no!
[02:54:30.005 --> 02:54:37.752]  We want to sue these people, or try to sue these people into oblivion, because you don't agree with me and you're violating my gay rights or whatever.
[02:54:39.577 --> 02:54:59.953]  And there's a double standard all the time with these people, but what I'm trying to establish here is this bake-the-cake precedent where we're introducing these things as new ideas, we're saying that this is okay now to sign laws allowing humans to be turned into compost and flesh goo.
[02:55:02.255 --> 02:55:05.938]  And the normalisation of this, what does it lead to later?
[02:55:06.784 --> 02:55:14.626]  Does it lead to the dissidents that have gone into these facilities when they don't want to comply with all the laws that I just told you about today?
[02:55:14.646 --> 02:55:18.708]  Does it set the precedent for them to be turned into flesh goo?
[02:55:19.548 --> 02:55:23.709]  And them to be composted to help climate change?
[02:55:24.289 --> 02:55:26.450]  We don't need these people, our facilities are overrun.
[02:55:26.470 --> 02:55:32.032]  We've spent all this money on these quarantine facilities and these damn dissenters don't want to comply.
[02:55:33.183 --> 02:55:34.684]  They're going to be in prison for life anyway.
[02:55:34.704 --> 02:55:36.244]  Let's just liquefy them.
[02:55:36.324 --> 02:55:37.765]  I mean, it sounds crazy.
[02:55:38.405 --> 02:55:41.307]  It sounds crazy, but need I remind you of Soylent Green?
[02:55:44.488 --> 02:55:57.474]  Soylent Green, which by 2022, if you read the plot, says the cumulative effects of overpopulation, pollution and an apparent climate catastrophe have caused severe worldwide shortages of food, water and housing.
[02:56:00.255 --> 02:56:12.132]   So are we setting the precedent For the implementation of what we were shown in Soylent Green in their propaganda by the year 2027 because they keep talking about this year.
[02:56:12.152 --> 02:56:15.633]  And we know that this part of the agenda ends in 2030.
[02:56:16.053 --> 02:56:18.454]  It's been an honour to be with you all today.
[02:56:18.474 --> 02:56:25.937]  Head to ZMedia.com or the ZMedia banner on InfoWars on Bandup Video for more information.
[02:56:25.936 --> 02:56:35.936]  Thank you so much and God bless you all.
[02:56:35.911 --> 02:56:36.933]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[02:56:36.953 --> 02:56:38.174]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[02:56:38.234 --> 02:56:39.616]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[02:56:39.676 --> 02:56:40.357]  And Joe Rogan?
[02:56:40.597 --> 02:56:41.078]  Elon Musk?
[02:56:41.378 --> 02:56:42.319]  You know where they tune in, right?
[02:56:42.520 --> 02:56:43.161]  They tune in right here!
[02:56:44.207 --> 02:56:46.948]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[02:56:47.568 --> 02:56:52.929]  We are witnessing the Mark of the Beast system openly rolled out and announced.
[02:56:53.409 --> 02:57:03.891]  Whether you believe the Bible is inspired by God or the Word of God or not, what was written over 2,000 years ago by John the Revelator on the Isle of Patmos is coming true.
[02:57:04.031 --> 02:57:14.595]   A world government that makes you take a mark in the hand or the head to be able to buy and sell and that you must worship the beast, that means Follow what the beast says, or you can't buy or sell.
[02:57:14.775 --> 02:57:16.877]  It's not just that you have to have the mark to buy or sell.
[02:57:17.757 --> 02:57:23.961]  You've got to do what the beast wants you to do, or you cannot buy and sell.
[02:57:24.101 --> 02:57:27.083]  And that's where, in late 2022, we are.
[02:57:27.284 --> 02:57:37.470]  Last week, the World Economic Forum was given over $100 million by the Government of Canada to roll out a World ID through the UN, based on the Communist Chinese digital social credit score system.
[02:57:37.610 --> 02:57:40.152]  And now, just today, Bill Gates came out.
[02:57:40.452 --> 02:57:41.313]  Here's the article right here.
[02:57:41.953 --> 02:57:50.737]  And his foundation donated $200 million to expand digital ID surveillance system for the same Chinese Communist control program.
[02:57:50.797 --> 02:58:02.383]  So the social credit score, Communist China, and all the control you see is the model of this system being rolled out in Spain, rolled out in Italy, rolled out in Germany, rolled out in Canada, and now they're trying to roll it out here in America.
[02:58:02.443 --> 02:58:10.467]  Just a few years ago, Klaus Schwab at the WEF said, you will have to take a microchip to buy and sell in the near future.
[02:58:11.067 --> 02:58:11.967]  And now here we are.
[02:58:12.647 --> 02:58:34.172]  So this is a huge, huge issue that they can then dictate to you through this new digital currency, through this World ID, every action you take in your life, with a carbon tax, through the social credit score, through universal basic income, as they shut off the regular economy and small businesses, making you sign on for government handout.
[02:58:34.592 --> 02:58:38.673]  But with that handout comes all of the rules of the game.
[02:58:39.943 --> 02:58:44.166]  This is no longer theoretical on some drawing board or some computer.
[02:58:44.807 --> 02:58:50.371]  This is something the bureaucrats and the megacorporations and major governments are doing.
[02:58:50.411 --> 02:58:57.396]  There's a race between the West and Communist China to see, with big tech, who can put this in first.
[02:58:58.826 --> 02:59:03.148]  It's scary, but at least we are exposing it, and at least we know about it.
[02:59:03.408 --> 02:59:18.315]  Just last week, PayPal said, if you criticize government, if you criticize open borders, or forced injections, or anything else, gun control, we're going to fine you $2,500 for what we say you're doing in your own personal life.
[02:59:18.335 --> 02:59:20.936]  We're going to surveil you, and then we're going to censor you.
[02:59:21.698 --> 02:59:25.862]  But within days of the announcement, they had to back off because of the backlash.
[02:59:26.723 --> 02:59:28.745]  So submitting to this only makes things worse.
[02:59:29.205 --> 02:59:32.208]  Standing up to it and saying no only makes things better.
[02:59:32.829 --> 02:59:44.520]  And that's why it's so important today, ladies and gentlemen, to say no to World War, no to nuclear war, no to open borders, no to pedophilia, no to the Satanism that is the New World Order.
[02:59:44.620 --> 02:59:46.142]  And you cannot do that better.
[02:59:47.332 --> 03:00:01.662]  Then sharing the articles and videos and links from InfoWars.com and Band.Video to be the Paul Reveres of your era and to get amazing products that God gave us through Mother Nature to empower our stamina, our energy, our libido, everything else including our immune systems.

[03:00:13.289 --> 03:00:20.088]   50% off. We've got a Save Info Wars 1776 Mega Sale running for the next week. The biggest
[03:00:20.088 --> 03:00:24.609]  sale is up to 60% off in the history of Info Wars at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:00:24.609 --> 03:00:32.168]   Thank you so much and join us during this important part of history.
[03:00:32.609 --> 03:00:37.609]   You got us the amazing sponsor a few years ago that have been great.
[03:00:38.106 --> 03:00:42.470]  The problem was everybody sold out of high quality but the same time affordable sat phones.
[03:00:42.490 --> 03:00:43.932]  They finally got them back in.
[03:00:44.032 --> 03:00:48.877]  They also have this amazing bivy stick dongle that turns any phone into a sat phone.
[03:00:49.037 --> 03:00:51.740]  Spend a few minutes telling folks about InfoWarsPhone.com.
[03:00:51.920 --> 03:01:02.048]  Well, first of all, anybody who's watched what happened in Florida absolutely saw people without power, people without communication, and the word when you lose communication is you panic.
[03:01:02.448 --> 03:01:16.537]   The nice thing about satellite phone stores is the owners have dedicated themselves to making sure everyone can stay in touch with their loved ones, that they understand How fragile the electrical grid is and also the cell phone communication grid.
[03:01:16.597 --> 03:01:20.878]  I'm told that there are hundreds of thousands of people without cell phones in Florida.
[03:01:20.998 --> 03:01:29.881]  And what was neat about Satellite Phone Store, Alex, they sent out vans and were finding people that had to communicate to let their loved ones know that they're alive.
[03:01:30.161 --> 03:01:33.842]  Communication in a survival situation is paramount.
[03:01:34.082 --> 03:01:38.703]  Not just to be keeping in contact with your loved ones, but for information services.
[03:01:38.783 --> 03:01:42.445]  So the BivyStick obviously is satellite to satellite.
[03:01:42.825 --> 03:01:48.326]  You use your cell phone in airplane mode, but this is probably one of the neatest things there is.
[03:01:48.446 --> 03:01:54.408]  The difference between the BivyStick and satellite phone is a voice communication, but you're limited to the amount of text you can send.
[03:01:54.448 --> 03:01:58.849]  With a BivyStick, you can give messaging, and that's one of the things that's so important.
[03:01:59.109 --> 03:02:01.229]  And these are free just with a year contract.
[03:02:01.229 --> 03:02:04.309]  They have the satellite phones back in stock.
[03:02:04.309 --> 03:02:07.828]   You mentioned that a thousand of them I believe available at the end of October.
[03:02:07.828 --> 03:02:08.988]  They've got the bivy stick.
[03:02:08.988 --> 03:02:11.028]  The package comes with a free phone.
[03:02:11.028 --> 03:02:12.828]  They have a satellite uplinks.
[03:02:12.828 --> 03:02:16.189]  They have the storage battery, the power solar generators.
[03:02:16.189 --> 03:02:21.549]   And in essence, they are a one-stop communication and electrical production facility.
[03:02:21.549 --> 03:02:23.349]  Go to infoworksphone.com or.
[03:02:23.402 --> 03:02:23.442]  941-955-1020.
[03:02:23.462 --> 03:02:24.404]  That's InfoWarsPhone.com or 941-955-1020.
[03:02:24.444 --> 03:02:25.266]  This is essential.
[03:02:25.306 --> 03:02:26.047]  Everybody needs this.
