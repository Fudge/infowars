[00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:01.290]  Yeah, Liberal World Order.
[00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.413]  I want to talk to everybody about what we can do about that announcement.
[00:00:04.993 --> 00:00:09.497]  And the first thing I think that people need to do is admit the problem.
[00:00:10.037 --> 00:00:14.641]  You need to admit that there is a hostile world government takeover.
[00:00:14.761 --> 00:00:19.264]  It is a very scary thing to admit that these people want you dead.
[00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:21.446]  They do not want you to have a family.
[00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:23.468]  They want an anti-human future.
[00:00:23.868 --> 00:00:27.331]  They are going to try to starve you out.
[00:00:27.987 --> 00:00:31.690]  By reducing energy, reducing crop yields, and creating war.
[00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.971]  They're going to try to kill you.
[00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:35.233]  You have to admit that to yourself, number one.
[00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:35.834]  That's right.
[00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:38.196]  They're in direct war against humanity.
[00:00:38.716 --> 00:00:39.977]  On record, they are the enemy.
[00:00:40.398 --> 00:00:44.461]  Anybody endorsing Great Reset Build Back Better is a literal enemy of humanity.
[00:00:45.882 --> 00:00:54.510]  Now that's hard for a lot of people to deal with, but once you get past that, it is very freeing, and instead of panicking, you just need to become the solution.
[00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:58.972]  And the first thing you need to do is to secure yourself and your family.
[00:00:59.453 --> 00:01:02.716]  So you just need to prepare for the pain that they're going to try to give you.
[00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:06.719]  Because just because they say they want to do this doesn't mean they're going to be able to.
[00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:14.846]  And they're putting us in pain to drive us into breaking down and accepting a world social credit score and universal basic income where they have complete control.
[00:01:16.187 --> 00:01:22.673]  And I hear a lot of people on here talking about how, you know, they started gardening or their neighbor has gardened or they're planning a garden and that is great.
[00:01:23.086 --> 00:01:36.034]  But it's starting to become later in the season, and one of the things you can do, let's say you don't have a lot of property, or you don't have a yard, or you live in a populated area, buy a little bit more food every time you go to the grocery store.
[00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:38.596]  And I'm not talking big stuff, I'm talking canned beans.
[00:01:38.636 --> 00:01:42.278]  That's right, because they'll only shut stuff down for a few months to make the average person break down.
[00:01:42.678 --> 00:01:44.840]  You've just got to be less weak than the last person.
[00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:52.551]  And don't forget about preparewithalex.com, My Patriot Supply, those are good as well, but if you don't have that much money, at least do something.
[00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:54.192]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[00:01:54.212 --> 00:01:55.552]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[00:01:55.572 --> 00:01:56.853]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[00:01:56.893 --> 00:01:59.774]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to, and Joe Rogan, Elon Musk?
[00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:03.155]  You know where they tune in, right?
[00:02:03.175 --> 00:02:05.896]  They tune in right here!
[00:02:05.916 --> 00:02:06.636]  InfoWars.
[00:02:06.795 --> 00:02:08.795]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:02:08.795 --> 00:02:22.795]  [Music]
[00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:24.795]  InfoWars.
[00:02:24.583 --> 00:02:25.504]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:02:25.764 --> 00:02:26.204]  Today.
[00:02:26.224 --> 00:02:49.122]  From the front lines.
[00:02:52.392 --> 00:02:57.479]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:58.661 --> 00:03:03.661]  What we are looking at is good and evil, right and wrong.
[00:03:03.661 --> 00:03:05.661]  A new world order.
[00:03:05.661 --> 00:03:09.661]  A new world order.
[00:03:09.661 --> 00:03:13.661]  A new world order.
[00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:16.661]  A new world order.
[00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:19.661]  A new world order.
[00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:22.661]  We're not about to make that same mistake.
[00:03:22.661 --> 00:03:25.661]  Go away! Go away!
[00:03:26.661 --> 00:03:36.661]   Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, July 1st, in the year 2022.
[00:03:36.661 --> 00:03:40.901]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:49.896]  And despite our enemy's best efforts, thanks to you and the good Lord above, we are still in attack formation.
[00:03:51.716 --> 00:03:52.817]  Stay in attack formation.
[00:03:54.127 --> 00:03:55.427]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:03:55.487 --> 00:03:57.328]  We are kicking some globalist ass.
[00:03:58.068 --> 00:04:08.470]  I took off yesterday to take care of a bunch of critical, behind-the-scenes stuff, but I was working hard, and I'm not ready to announce some of this news yet, but it's very important.
[00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.171]  I should be able to tell you about it.
[00:04:10.631 --> 00:04:15.252]  Maybe today, probably sometime next week, but certainly some very, very good news.
[00:04:15.272 --> 00:04:16.032]  We'll fight for liberty.
[00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:17.932]  There was a big Supreme Court ruling.
[00:04:18.252 --> 00:04:20.613]  I gotta tell you, I don't put all my faith in the Supreme Court.
[00:04:21.732 --> 00:04:38.000]  And they've made a lot of bad rulings, but they have made a bunch of good ones the last week, two weeks as you know, and they just made a big ruling saying you can't have the EPA just randomly make law and shut down all the power plants and the coal power plants in America.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.681]  We got rolling blackouts everywhere.
[00:04:40.281 --> 00:04:43.582]  And you can't say carbon dioxide is a pollutant when it's not.
[00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:46.084]  Carbon dioxide is what plants breathe.
[00:04:46.864 --> 00:04:50.646]  They try to confuse it with carbon monoxide that'll kill plants or humans.
[00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.753]  And so this is just massive news while they're busy announcing.
[00:04:57.854 --> 00:05:05.378]  I've got multiple clips today, saw multiple clips yesterday of White House officials saying, yeah, we're turning off the energy.
[00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:07.219]  We're moving to solar.
[00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:08.340]  We're moving to wind.
[00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:12.322]  If they built windmills and solar for 20 years, it couldn't power everything.
[00:05:12.383 --> 00:05:14.244]  It doesn't even work at those levels.
[00:05:14.264 --> 00:05:28.509]   So they're saying we are here to bankrupt The American people, while China and India and everybody else don't make any cuts, and now Russia was the third largest oil provider, now they're the biggest oil provider.
[00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.430]  In many ways, Russia's doing better during this war, and it's all at our expense.
[00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:42.411]  So, that is a huge, massive issue that ties in, again, with the Obama officials.
[00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:45.652]  That's not a Freudian slip, that's his third unelected term.
[00:05:47.136 --> 00:05:56.079]  Saying, yeah, we're going to bankrupt oil and gas and other fossil fuels.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.440]  They're going to bankrupt you.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:19.915]   And that ties in to this first clip we're going to play when we come back in the next segment, where they have the White House spokesperson on national television Saying it's a liberal world order and boy has this quote really gotten people's attention in a big way.
[00:06:20.596 --> 00:06:22.477]  So we got a bunch of news on that front.
[00:06:22.497 --> 00:06:24.058]  The attack on our energy is central.
[00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.581]  The attack on our bodies with the deadly shots and the bioweapons is central.
[00:06:28.061 --> 00:06:29.662]  The attack on the currencies is central.
[00:06:29.702 --> 00:06:31.964]  The attack on the national sovereignty and borders is central.
[00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:34.386]  The attack on our spirit is critical.
[00:06:34.986 --> 00:06:41.973]   It's absolutely A number one, and we're going to be going over all of it on this special Friday edition.
[00:06:41.993 --> 00:06:46.297]  We're going to have open phones and so much more here today.
[00:06:46.597 --> 00:06:48.639]  Infowars.com.
[00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:50.900]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:52.241 --> 00:07:00.768]  And of course you can find all the verboten forbidden videos and information at the vaunted band dot video, but that URL is restricted most places.
[00:07:00.788 --> 00:07:04.651]  So the URL that takes you there is the info war, the info war.tv.
[00:07:06.557 --> 00:07:11.019]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, July 1st.
[00:07:11.579 --> 00:07:21.282]  On this special worldwide edition of the Transmission, we have another just unbelievably powerful broadcast for you today.
[00:07:21.822 --> 00:07:25.563]  A lot of super good, positive news.
[00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:29.685]  Also a lot of really ugly, ugly, ugly, horrible news.
[00:07:30.245 --> 00:07:32.946]  And some very dangerous news as well.
[00:07:33.926 --> 00:07:38.530]  And a lot of really hilarious stuff that will actually make you cry when you actually think deeper about it.
[00:07:39.191 --> 00:07:45.316]  We've got big Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein news that is just devastating to the globalist pedophile rings.
[00:07:46.096 --> 00:07:49.059]  We've got huge Ukraine news.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.801]  We've got so much here today.
[00:07:55.064 --> 00:07:57.686]  We have Dr. Zev Zelenko dying yesterday.
[00:07:57.706 --> 00:07:58.787]  I was working yesterday.
[00:07:59.247 --> 00:08:03.247]   It's not a vacation day, but I had to take care of my stuff, keep him forced on the air.
[00:08:03.247 --> 00:08:07.247]   And I learned after Owen was already off air that he had died.
[00:08:07.247 --> 00:08:14.247]   I knew privately from folks that were working with him that he would probably die last week
[00:08:14.247 --> 00:08:23.247]   and was extremely ill with cancer all over his body, with one lung and with blood clots, not just in his heart.
[00:08:23.208 --> 00:08:30.253]  And so when we play his final words from just three days ago, where he says, this is the hill to die on.
[00:08:30.273 --> 00:08:33.175]  And his final words are just extremely powerful.
[00:08:33.195 --> 00:08:37.558]  It, it, it made me cry yesterday because he was such a loving, sweet, good person.
[00:08:38.018 --> 00:08:46.624]  And he was really one of the first doctors to come out against the new world order over, uh, you know, 27, 28 months ago and really nailed it.
[00:08:47.685 --> 00:08:49.528]  And was just such had such a beautiful spirit.
[00:08:49.928 --> 00:09:13.963]   We know he is with us in eternity And he certainly understood that better than better than most of us so beautiful soul a beautiful mind and a brother and people are just really really touched by his passing This is our Hill to Die On, and his last words, and these are his last words to the world, the last 30 seconds of what he says is just so calm and so focused and so true.
[00:09:14.744 --> 00:09:18.770]  And this little six and a half minute clip we're going to play at the bottom of the hour is powerful.
[00:09:19.924 --> 00:09:22.725]  It's at Bandot Video in the Bill Gates' Evil section.
[00:09:23.405 --> 00:09:24.605]  And we did a lot of interviews with him.
[00:09:24.665 --> 00:09:25.966]  He was on the other shows as well.
[00:09:26.726 --> 00:09:34.908]  We've put a compilation of some of those together that will be airing coming up in the third hour today.
[00:09:35.168 --> 00:09:43.030]  But I will, bottom of this hour, play his last statement after he'd already been in surgeries and was going to have to go into emergency surgery.
[00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.971]  He was basically having a heart attack while he recorded this.
[00:09:47.958 --> 00:09:50.560]  And when you realize that, that's a tough guy.
[00:09:51.621 --> 00:09:55.124]  You can actually see when he's talking, you can see him kind of go, I mean, he is literally fighting.
[00:09:55.864 --> 00:10:02.590]  His heart is absolutely out of control with arrhythmia, as you name it, while he is giving this final message.
[00:10:02.650 --> 00:10:05.352]  And he does it so calmly and so focused.
[00:10:06.213 --> 00:10:07.574]  Just real resilience.
[00:10:09.255 --> 00:10:10.416]  Powerful, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:11.497 --> 00:10:15.394]   That is coming up at the Bottom of the hour.
[00:10:15.414 --> 00:10:25.104]  Brings tears to my eyes right now because he was fighting so hard and he didn't want to die because he wanted to keep fighting but he knows he'll continue fighting through us and don't worry Dr. Zelenko, we're gonna up our game.
[00:10:26.265 --> 00:10:29.768]  I'm gonna up my game, we're all gonna up our game like he did.
[00:10:29.808 --> 00:10:36.696]  Traveling the country, working 15, 16 hours a day until the last few days he died.
[00:10:37.901 --> 00:10:40.262]  And that's the human spirit, and that's what I admire.
[00:10:40.282 --> 00:10:45.285]  I don't give a rat's ass about football players, or movie stars, or any of that crap.
[00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:49.607]  But people that are trailblazers and buck the system, they're beautiful, and they're examples to us all.
[00:10:50.507 --> 00:10:56.730]  And Joe Rogan made that point about Fauci and how evil he is, and people like Zelenko and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:10:57.671 --> 00:11:00.172]  are true leaders leading us out of this tyranny.
[00:11:00.592 --> 00:11:06.355]  That's coming up after the Zelenko clip as well, bottom of the hour segment, so stay with us for that.
[00:11:08.061 --> 00:11:14.224]  Okay, if I mention all the good things the Supreme Court's done the last two weeks, it would take up the whole segment.
[00:11:14.244 --> 00:11:24.370]  So I'm just going to remind you, they said you can't stop Christians from saying they're Christians, or saying prayers at commencement speeches, or football players saying prayers, or coaches if they want to, that's their First Amendment.
[00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.992]  You just can't have state-run religion telling people what religion you can be.
[00:11:29.432 --> 00:11:36.316]  Government has no jurisdiction in your religious practices as long as they're not illegal, you know, sacrificing babies like the Satanists do.
[00:11:39.138 --> 00:11:42.780]  And they're not even arguing under the First Amendment, they should be able to do that in official court documents this year.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:43.541]  I'm not kidding.
[00:11:44.161 --> 00:11:45.402]  I'm sure you heard about it, it was big news.
[00:11:46.362 --> 00:11:56.289]  So, we had that, we had the Roe v. Wade that was massive, we had the Second Amendment saying these states and these cities can't just ban people owning guns that don't have criminal records.
[00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:58.750]  You can't just bar them from even gun permits.
[00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.092]  Even permits themselves are unconstitutional.
[00:12:01.592 --> 00:12:02.312]  Massive ruling.
[00:12:02.332 --> 00:12:03.133]  It was a bunch of other ones.
[00:12:04.249 --> 00:12:13.171]  But this ruling on energy, if you just talk about the economy and the economic globalist reset war we're under, is gigantor.
[00:12:13.771 --> 00:12:31.505]   And obviously it's going to override the FDA and the EPA and all these agencies that don't care about our health, that don't care about the fentanyl, that don't care about leaking nuclear reactors, they care about power and siege and the Great Reset, And bringing us to our knees.
[00:12:31.545 --> 00:12:34.446]  And so I read the Supreme Court ruling last night.
[00:12:35.487 --> 00:12:37.607]  And it's very clear, very cut and dry, and true!
[00:12:38.147 --> 00:12:44.229]  Congress never passed laws banning carbon dioxide or water vapor out of smokestacks of clean burning coal plants.
[00:12:44.669 --> 00:12:45.970]  They never ban natural gas.
[00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:48.031]  They never ban the use of oil and fuel.
[00:12:48.511 --> 00:12:51.992]  And you've got the Democrats saying under the UN global mandate, they're banning it.
[00:12:52.692 --> 00:12:55.553]  So they said, none of these regulations are constitutional.
[00:12:56.253 --> 00:13:02.425]   You can't make law via Proclamation from a federal agency.
[00:13:03.766 --> 00:13:05.806]  Congress has to be elected and then pass laws.
[00:13:06.206 --> 00:13:07.887]  It's got to be found constitutional by the court.
[00:13:08.627 --> 00:13:27.292]  But the EPA and the FDA and the EEOC and all these groups and the IRS are just imperiums, imperial courts under themselves that just do whatever the hell they want, and then special interests get their people into those agencies, and they are the fourth branch of an elected deep state government.
[00:13:28.072 --> 00:13:29.913]  The bureaucracy is the true deep state.
[00:13:31.434 --> 00:13:39.543]  And so this ruling doesn't just overturn the shutdown of almost all the coal power plants, but see, how are they going to reopen now?
[00:13:39.563 --> 00:13:44.268]  It took billions of dollars to build the bigger plants, hundreds of millions of smaller ones.
[00:13:45.068 --> 00:13:48.512]  So it's kind of like a day late and a dollar short here.
[00:13:49.853 --> 00:13:51.655]  But it rolls back so much.
[00:13:52.196 --> 00:14:01.079]   And remember, a year and a half ago, Much of Texas was out of power because the feds wouldn't let them up output at the coal power plants.
[00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:03.120]  Only got like 15 plants left.
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:04.720]  They supply over half the state's power.
[00:14:06.021 --> 00:14:08.782]  There's a gigantic plant outside Austin called the Fayetteville plant.
[00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:10.922]  Three gigantic plants.
[00:14:12.023 --> 00:14:19.885]  And Austin owned two of them and sold them for less than 10% of their value to shut them down.
[00:14:21.146 --> 00:14:23.787]  So taxpayers paid for these gigantic coal power plants.
[00:14:23.807 --> 00:14:24.427]  They're totally clean.
[00:14:26.517 --> 00:14:31.940]  And the Austin City Council, what, a decade ago, ordered them shut down within five years.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.081]  Both of them were shut down.
[00:14:33.121 --> 00:14:38.403]  There's one plant going overdrive that is supplying Austin more than half its power right now.
[00:14:40.104 --> 00:14:41.665]  You go out there, it's going overdrive.
[00:14:41.685 --> 00:14:48.749]  You notice what they call smoke coming out the top disappears after a few hundred feet because it's not smoke, it's steam.
[00:14:49.977 --> 00:14:57.578]  And in the summer, you see nothing coming out of it, because it's 100 degrees, and the stuff coming out of the furnace is 100 degrees, and the smokestack, you see nothing coming out.
[00:14:58.639 --> 00:14:59.319]  That's how clean they are.
[00:14:59.579 --> 00:15:09.921]  Now, in the winter, they aim their cameras at them, and you'll see this big steam cloud going for, you know, a half mile, and they go, look at that pollution, my lord, it's so incredibly evil!
[00:15:09.941 --> 00:15:12.161]  I think you guys just found the Fayetteville clip.
[00:15:12.341 --> 00:15:15.322]  Yeah, Fayetteville, Texas, power plant complex.
[00:15:16.547 --> 00:15:17.808]  Two of the big plants are shut down.
[00:15:17.928 --> 00:15:18.648]  One is left going.
[00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:20.529]  And you can go out there and look at it for yourself.
[00:15:20.929 --> 00:15:26.291]  And all that's coming out of those stacks, ladies and gentlemen, is... Yeah, that's not Fayetteville.
[00:15:26.311 --> 00:15:27.072]  That's a smaller facility.
[00:15:27.092 --> 00:15:27.532]  It's still big.
[00:15:29.107 --> 00:15:30.147]  That may be fair, Bill, actually.
[00:15:30.167 --> 00:15:37.511]  The point is, is that all that's coming out of there is water vapor and carbon dioxide, but they aim cameras at it and tell you a bunch of toxic waste is coming out.
[00:15:37.851 --> 00:15:39.292]  Let me tell you where the toxic waste is coming out.
[00:15:39.872 --> 00:15:41.413]  It's coming out of China and Mexico.
[00:15:41.433 --> 00:15:46.395]  And you go down to the Texas border, there are huge coal power plants right across the border with black smoke coming out of them.
[00:15:46.935 --> 00:15:52.417]  That's dirty coal full of mercury and toxins being ejected out of there that gets into the atmosphere and we breathe it.
[00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:57.640]  So they shut down the clean plants and let China and Mexico and India run dirty ones.
[00:15:58.527 --> 00:16:01.068]  And then you wonder why they have cheaper electricity and why all the jobs move there.
[00:16:01.428 --> 00:16:02.648]  It's economic warfare.
[00:16:02.668 --> 00:16:03.408]  They're foot on our necks.
[00:16:03.888 --> 00:16:05.729]  Part of the liberal world order.
[00:16:06.289 --> 00:16:13.911]  So I got a bunch of clips when we come back of the White House spokesman on CNN saying, well of course we've got higher gas prices.
[00:16:13.951 --> 00:16:15.051]  It's part of the new world order.
[00:16:15.091 --> 00:16:15.652]  It's liberal.
[00:16:16.032 --> 00:16:17.132]  We have a liberal agenda here.
[00:16:17.552 --> 00:16:29.715]   And we have the other officials in the Obama administration, the third Obama administration, known as the Biden administration, saying we're doing this to bankrupt You know, gasoline cars, and we're doing this for the liberal world order.
[00:16:31.515 --> 00:16:37.077]  In Europe, they're banning tractor gasoline, tractor diesel, and they're all protesting.
[00:16:37.157 --> 00:16:39.558]  I mean, this is feudalism.
[00:16:39.958 --> 00:16:40.478]  This is a takeover.
[00:16:40.498 --> 00:16:41.699]  We're going to talk about it when we come back.
[00:16:43.133 --> 00:16:46.677]  They say that this could be a long war, measured in years.
[00:16:46.777 --> 00:16:49.699]  And I think everybody understands why this is happening.
[00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:50.961]  But is it sustainable?
[00:16:51.001 --> 00:16:57.647]  What do you say to those families who say, listen, we can't afford to pay $4.85 a gallon for months, if not years.
[00:16:57.687 --> 00:16:58.948]  This is just not sustainable.
[00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:04.733]  Well, what you heard from the president today was a clear articulation of the stakes.
[00:17:04.833 --> 00:17:08.417]  This is about the future of the liberal world order, and we have to stand firm.
[00:17:08.851 --> 00:17:13.392]  We have a club coming up of Biden saying, Russia, Russia, Russia, copying Trump.
[00:17:13.432 --> 00:17:16.773]  He goes, it's Russia is the reason there's no food.
[00:17:16.853 --> 00:17:19.774]  It's Russia is the reason the gas prices are so high.
[00:17:21.514 --> 00:17:26.055]  That, of course, is White House spokesperson Brian Deese saying that.
[00:17:27.736 --> 00:17:33.077]  Meanwhile, Biden just announced a plan to shut down America's largest domestic oil field.
[00:17:35.018 --> 00:17:35.958]  Land-based oil field.
[00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:43.071]  They're shutting down the baby formula plants, they're shutting down the major meatpacking plants, and the other ones are mysteriously burning up.
[00:17:43.211 --> 00:17:48.612]  I mean, have you figured out, folks, we're under attack at every level.
[00:17:51.673 --> 00:17:53.953]  So what an incredible statement out of that guy.
[00:17:55.533 --> 00:18:02.434]  Being honest that, oh, it's a liberal world order and it's the war, though, that's the reason things are never going to get better.
[00:18:03.935 --> 00:18:11.450]   But then all the other spokespersons Say it's a transition off of fossil fuels, but they're not even transitioning us on anything.
[00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:27.415]  And the little bit of systems, the batteries and the solar panels, and all of that is coming almost entirely from China, so it's a complete transference of our industrial power of what's left.
[00:18:28.115 --> 00:18:35.278]  All we had left was our high-tech and our oil, and now they've transferred the high-tech, and now they're transferring the energy away.
[00:18:36.843 --> 00:18:39.904]  And all these other countries are becoming energy leaders while we are destroyed.
[00:18:40.364 --> 00:18:46.125]  Notice it's only against Europe and the United States and Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:18:46.265 --> 00:19:00.948]  It is the British Empire countries that are running this new world order because they control much of the third world countries where all the industry is being developed and then they can further dominate the globe while impoverishing us for control.
[00:19:02.731 --> 00:19:06.715]  Here's Joe Biden, as I mentioned, continuing to blame everything on Vladimir Putin.
[00:19:06.735 --> 00:19:07.095]  Here it is.
[00:19:06.914 --> 00:19:14.914]   Ultimately, the reason why gas prices are up is because of Russia.
[00:19:14.914 --> 00:19:21.914]   Russia, Russia, Russia. The reason why the food crisis exists is because of Russia.
[00:19:21.914 --> 00:19:24.914]  Russia not allowing grain to get out of Ukraine.
[00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:32.914]   Now here's just a clip of farmers in Belgium, farmers in France, farmers in Germany,
[00:19:32.914 --> 00:19:37.914]   farmers in the Netherlands blocking major highways because the EU announced
[00:19:37.914 --> 00:19:41.914]   that they're not just going to let them pay extra taxes for their diesel or gasoline,
[00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:46.914]   that they are forcing them to transition off of it and are paying farmers,
[00:19:46.914 --> 00:19:49.914]  a one-time sum, to never farm again.
[00:19:49.914 --> 00:19:59.914]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:19:51.219 --> 00:19:52.119]  That's the London Guardian.
[00:19:53.519 --> 00:19:58.952]   And you wonder why millions of people, millions, are protesting and blocking roads.
[00:19:59.612 --> 00:20:02.914]  They are literally being shut down.
[00:20:03.655 --> 00:20:04.436]  It's the same thing.
[00:20:04.516 --> 00:20:05.676]  It's not Russia.
[00:20:07.318 --> 00:20:08.899]  The farmers aren't blaming Russia.
[00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:09.839]  It's preposterous.
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:21.188]  And of course, Biden last week tried to blame gas stations for the price, when everybody knows gas stations might make 20 cents a gallon on the frickin' gas.
[00:20:23.229 --> 00:20:24.450]  Most stations lose money.
[00:20:26.087 --> 00:20:30.649]  They use the gas to bring you in to buy soft drinks, beer, cigarettes, lottery tickets.
[00:20:31.749 --> 00:20:33.469]  I mean, this is just insane!
[00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:36.671]  But they think you're stupid.
[00:20:36.691 --> 00:20:37.651]  They think I'm stupid.
[00:20:37.691 --> 00:20:38.251]  But we're not.
[00:20:38.531 --> 00:20:39.612]  We know it's you.
[00:20:40.092 --> 00:20:41.732]  We know it's a worldwide agenda.
[00:20:43.313 --> 00:20:44.913]  Here's another clip.
[00:20:44.933 --> 00:20:46.394]  This is Gina McCarthy.
[00:20:47.574 --> 00:20:52.077]  This is one of the Obama administration advisors for the third Obama administration.
[00:20:52.097 --> 00:20:53.819]  I'm just going to refer to it as the Obama administration.
[00:20:54.099 --> 00:20:55.700]  The unelected third Obama administration.
[00:20:56.921 --> 00:20:58.622]  Making a lot of comments on these subjects.
[00:20:58.642 --> 00:20:58.983]  Here it is.
[00:21:00.131 --> 00:21:06.877]  We have opportunities now to transfer to clean energy in a way that grows thousands of jobs.
[00:21:07.117 --> 00:21:15.865]  We just had a recent report that was put out that's showing all of the energy in the employment stats from last year.
[00:21:16.286 --> 00:21:17.527]  Clean energy is winning!
[00:21:18.027 --> 00:21:19.988]  Fossil fuels losing jobs.
[00:21:20.389 --> 00:21:22.590]  We are gaining them every step of the way.
[00:21:23.070 --> 00:21:38.841]  And so the challenge is now that we're moving from denial to actually just trying to disengage the public from understanding the values of solar energy, the values of wind energy, the benefits of clean energy.
[00:21:39.241 --> 00:21:40.482]  We have to get tighter.
[00:21:40.842 --> 00:21:43.304]  We have to get better at communicating.
[00:21:43.684 --> 00:21:52.368]  And frankly, the tech companies have to stop allowing specific individuals over and over again to spread disinformation.
[00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:55.269]  That's what the fossil fuel companies pay for.
[00:21:55.629 --> 00:22:04.433]  That's what folks who make money out of fossil fuels and don't make money and don't care about saving consumers costs.
[00:22:04.713 --> 00:22:05.853]  That's what they do.
[00:22:06.153 --> 00:22:10.315]  We have to be smarter than that and we need the tech companies to really jump in.
[00:22:12.301 --> 00:22:13.722]  That's directly from the White House.
[00:22:15.123 --> 00:22:19.627]  And I could play you another hundred clips of the different criminals up there saying that.
[00:22:19.727 --> 00:22:21.829]  So they have a name for what she just said.
[00:22:22.449 --> 00:22:32.578]  It's called a declaration of war against you and your family and your standard of living to drive you into the social credit score, universal basic income bankruptcy.
[00:22:33.538 --> 00:22:34.339]  That's their game plan.
[00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:35.140]  Make you dependent.
[00:22:36.044 --> 00:22:39.086]  Take your right to defense away, take the police away while they have armed guards.
[00:22:39.606 --> 00:22:45.510]  Every level of it is a hypocritic fraud by this cult, and it is our acquiescence and our ignorance that allows them to do this.
[00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:46.590]  Did you hear?
[00:22:47.191 --> 00:22:56.016]  Now we want to take your speech not to say the vaccine isn't a vaccine, not to say hydroxychloroquine or other things work.
[00:22:57.472 --> 00:23:01.738]  Not to just block treatment with vitamin C or ivermectin.
[00:23:02.139 --> 00:23:11.572]  No, now we don't want you, and they're saying this everywhere, to be able to question not just man-made global warming, but all the policies they have of banning meat.
[00:23:12.461 --> 00:23:16.064]  And having a phone with a carbon credit, track everywhere you go, what you do.
[00:23:16.244 --> 00:23:17.926]  They're putting the ball and chain on.
[00:23:18.186 --> 00:23:20.328]  They're putting the handcuffs on.
[00:23:20.368 --> 00:23:26.032]  They're putting the chains on our bodies, on our economy, on us right now.
[00:23:26.413 --> 00:23:27.874]  So, when they take your speech...
[00:23:29.582 --> 00:23:41.568]  They then take your energy, your mobility, your freedom, and finally your life, which is their goal, global collapse and global depopulation.
[00:23:42.348 --> 00:23:48.311]  You will own nothing, you will have nothing, and you will like it.
[00:23:48.511 --> 00:23:54.694]  Think of the cult-like statements that this group is making.
[00:23:57.135 --> 00:23:58.676]  And then we've got stacks of news.
[00:24:01.653 --> 00:24:02.134]  Like this.
[00:24:02.754 --> 00:24:08.620]  Toronto police cause confusion with post about missing woman with goatee.
[00:24:09.261 --> 00:24:13.165]  And it looks like a crazy meth head schizophrenic with a full beard.
[00:24:13.546 --> 00:24:14.387]  Not just a goatee.
[00:24:15.668 --> 00:24:16.329]  Moustache.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:22.162]  And they put that in your face and show you a man and say, we're looking for a missing woman.
[00:24:22.382 --> 00:24:32.106]  It's all about training you to just see absurdity everywhere, lies everywhere, the murder of logic and common sense everywhere, where you just go into a catatonic state and roll over.
[00:24:32.386 --> 00:24:32.706]  Guess what?
[00:24:32.726 --> 00:24:33.626]  I told you this was coming.
[00:24:34.066 --> 00:24:46.912]  Not just men competing in women's sports, now men are identifying as children and winning in a competition 10 years old to 18.
[00:24:49.011 --> 00:24:52.253]  Trans skateboarder defiant after beating child rivals.
[00:24:54.614 --> 00:24:56.595]  So, I identify as a 10-year-old.
[00:24:56.635 --> 00:25:00.397]  I'm gonna go join a peewee baseball group or a Pop Warner football.
[00:25:01.697 --> 00:25:03.258]  And I'm gonna play 10-year-olds and I'm gonna win.
[00:25:03.298 --> 00:25:04.859]  I'll be the greatest 10-year-old you ever saw.
[00:25:06.598 --> 00:25:07.719]  We got a lot more coming up.
[00:25:08.559 --> 00:25:11.001]  Dr. Zev Zelenko, straight ahead, his final words.
[00:25:11.041 --> 00:25:12.421]  Stay with us, InfoWars.com.
[00:25:13.102 --> 00:25:26.830]  Well, I saw something extremely powerful yesterday afternoon after I learned that Dr. Zev Zelenko, just a wonderful fighter against medical tyranny and for human liberty, that I learned he had made a few days ago before he died.
[00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:32.413]  And it has his last public words on it, and it's extremely powerful.
[00:25:34.014 --> 00:25:35.715]  We're going to be playing that coming up here.
[00:25:37.102 --> 00:25:38.123]  In just a few minutes.
[00:25:41.124 --> 00:25:58.733]  But when you think about the magnitude of what we've been hit by, and how the system is targeting Dr. Peter McCullough, trying to take his license right now, because he's become very prominent and well-spoken here and on Joe Rogan and Fox News and so many places, it's criminal.
[00:25:59.573 --> 00:26:13.470]   And it shows that they've got to silence leaders Who are willing to stand up to their tyranny so that other leaders who are thinking about standing up think there's no hope and roll over to the tyranny.
[00:26:15.452 --> 00:26:27.644]  There is nothing but hope and assured victory if we have courage and get rid of the fear and take action and do the right thing like Dr. Zelenko did very early on and prominently.
[00:26:29.261 --> 00:26:36.926]  What you should all be concerned about is people being cowards and being intimidated by this intimidation and rolling over.
[00:26:38.587 --> 00:26:43.810]  Next segment, I'm going to play a very powerful clip of Joe Rogan making just these points.
[00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:48.753]  But first, I'm going to go to the Dr. Zelenko clip here in just a moment.
[00:26:49.625 --> 00:26:57.873]  But let me read to you the last 30 seconds of what he had to say, and then we're going to play the clip in full, his last public words.
[00:26:58.593 --> 00:27:01.596]  Dr. Zev Zelenko, right here on air today.
[00:27:03.338 --> 00:27:11.305]  The world has now chosen sides, those that will worship the machinations of man and those that will bow down to the Creator.
[00:27:12.246 --> 00:27:13.227]  So let the culling begin.
[00:27:14.195 --> 00:27:15.575]  The world needs a cleaning.
[00:27:16.236 --> 00:27:21.937]  When the process is done, the world will be filled with the knowledge of God, just like the waters cover the seas.
[00:27:22.998 --> 00:27:25.898]  The sociopaths have a big thing coming for them.
[00:27:26.739 --> 00:27:27.719]  They think they are gods.
[00:27:27.739 --> 00:27:29.099]  They think they're ruling the world.
[00:27:29.459 --> 00:27:30.040]  We'll see.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.120]  Let the games begin.
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:37.782]  I have no problem falling in battle, because this is a hill we need to die on.
[00:27:38.142 --> 00:27:41.822]  Otherwise, our progeny will have nowhere to breathe free.
[00:27:41.822 --> 00:27:51.102]  And that is his final public words.
[00:27:51.307 --> 00:27:57.550]  Otherwise, our progeny, our children and their children, our future will have nowhere to breathe free.
[00:28:00.311 --> 00:28:01.572]  This clip's on Bandit Video.
[00:28:01.612 --> 00:28:02.432]  I hope you share it.
[00:28:02.472 --> 00:28:04.273]  We love you, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko.
[00:28:04.333 --> 00:28:06.613]  You're a great patriot and you will live on forever.
[00:28:06.633 --> 00:28:08.574]  And we know we'll see you on the other side.
[00:28:08.994 --> 00:28:10.455]  Here is Dr. Zelenko's final words.
[00:28:11.315 --> 00:28:15.497]  And if I have to leave the world, I accept God's will.
[00:28:16.312 --> 00:28:25.312]   But I encourage and plead with everyone else to up your game and stand up and resist.
[00:28:25.312 --> 00:28:36.312]   Hi, this is Dr. Zelenko and I'm making this video from my hospital bed.
[00:28:37.324 --> 00:28:38.685]  I just want to give a quick update.
[00:28:39.505 --> 00:28:44.488]  Many, many people have expressed their love and prayers and I'm very grateful.
[00:28:44.708 --> 00:28:44.988]  Thank you.
[00:28:46.424 --> 00:29:00.995]  Unfortunately, I had an MRI and a transesophageal echocardiogram called a TE, and it found a tumor in my right ventricle.
[00:29:02.195 --> 00:29:06.258]  That's the lower right chamber of the heart.
[00:29:07.459 --> 00:29:09.781]  And on top of that tumor is a blood clot.
[00:29:13.043 --> 00:29:14.004]  That's not pretty good news.
[00:29:14.344 --> 00:29:15.565]  It's not good news.
[00:29:16.797 --> 00:29:24.443]  And the treatment would be to go on blood thinners, which I'm on, to try to dissolve the clot.
[00:29:25.163 --> 00:29:27.685]  And then we have to figure out what to do with that tumor.
[00:29:30.047 --> 00:29:35.310]  To be frank, if that clot breaks off, that's a ticket to the next world.
[00:29:38.092 --> 00:29:43.256]  Also, there are more tumors around my lower left lobe and my lung.
[00:29:45.211 --> 00:29:49.152]  So, I'm in a precarious situation.
[00:29:50.192 --> 00:29:58.595]  However, as King David writes, even though I walk in the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for God is with me.
[00:29:59.355 --> 00:30:05.157]  And I do really feel that way, and those words resonate in my soul more now than ever in my life.
[00:30:06.297 --> 00:30:13.379]  And there is a Talmudic teaching that even if the sword is on your neck, a person should never give up hope.
[00:30:14.497 --> 00:30:17.418]  And so I'm in a very good state of mind.
[00:30:17.438 --> 00:30:44.691]   And as I frequently said, they don't have to carry my body off the battlefield because my resolve to help humanity, the vulnerable, the innocent, decent people overcome This terrible darkness and plague that is upon us has never been stronger.
[00:30:45.671 --> 00:30:49.974]  And if I have to leave the world, I accept God's will.
[00:30:50.914 --> 00:30:59.698]  But I encourage and plead with everyone else to up your game and stand up and resist.
[00:31:00.939 --> 00:31:04.501]  Resist first within yourselves against giving in to fear.
[00:31:05.777 --> 00:31:15.743]  And then resist publicly against the policies of tyranny, which are coming again, because it's pretty obvious what's going to happen right now.
[00:31:16.724 --> 00:31:27.991]  The World Health Organization, which is essentially funded by the sociopath Gates, is gaining more and more power over sovereign nations.
[00:31:29.031 --> 00:31:34.655]  Gates messaged, I think five or six months ago, that smallpox is a big threat.
[00:31:35.586 --> 00:31:49.417]  And then, supposedly, it was eradicated in 1980, and it was only found in two labs in America and in Russia, in DSL Level 4 labs, the highest maximum security labs.
[00:31:49.877 --> 00:32:07.280]   And yet, five days after the sociopath criminal Gates said his prophetic words, a few vials of smallpox were found in an unsecure refrigerator in a Uh, Merck Laboratory in Philadelphia.
[00:32:08.161 --> 00:32:12.363]  And so, it's not surprising to me now that we're seeing monkeypox.
[00:32:13.604 --> 00:32:17.206]  Uh, I anticipate, um, global panic about it.
[00:32:17.226 --> 00:32:40.927]   This will be the next media horror narrative that, uh, will continue the fear campaign to, and lockdown campaign, and mass campaign to, uh, Create anxiety, isolate you from people you love and dehumanize you with with these face diapers.
[00:32:41.887 --> 00:32:46.848]  And so this is their playbook.
[00:32:47.988 --> 00:33:29.358]   And they're going to keep on sending wave after wave of their evil agenda until we make internal resolutions To kick the evil out from within us, we should, in my opinion, denounce the worship of false gods, the god of technology, the god of science, the god of corrupt governments, money, power, fame, and reconcile our hearts with our creator, who's making us anew every instant in time.
[00:33:30.699 --> 00:33:33.001]  Basically, the world has now chosen sides.
[00:33:34.401 --> 00:33:42.666]  Those that will worship the machinations of man and those that will bow down to the Creator.
[00:33:43.807 --> 00:33:45.448]  And so let the calling begin.
[00:33:45.468 --> 00:33:53.973]  You know, the world needs a cleaning.
[00:33:58.924 --> 00:34:05.310]  And when the process is done, the world will be filled with the knowledge of God, just like the waters cover the seas.
[00:34:06.771 --> 00:34:10.214]  And the sociopaths have a big thing coming for them.
[00:34:11.055 --> 00:34:13.156]  They think they're gods.
[00:34:13.216 --> 00:34:14.658]  They think that they're ruling the world.
[00:34:16.499 --> 00:34:16.839]  We'll see.
[00:34:18.801 --> 00:34:19.742]  So let the games begin.
[00:34:21.423 --> 00:34:26.728]  And I have no problem falling in battle, because this is a hill that we need to dive.
[00:34:27.912 --> 00:34:34.912]   because otherwise our progeny will have nowhere to breathe free.
[00:34:34.912 --> 00:34:41.912]  All the waiting's over!
[00:34:42.099 --> 00:34:44.921]  We tried to stop it, but the Bible said it would be fulfilled so it will.
[00:34:45.881 --> 00:34:48.023]  Can't say that I still didn't try to fight it and stop it.
[00:34:48.743 --> 00:34:49.924]  God says we're supposed to do that.
[00:34:50.484 --> 00:34:52.325]  We'll be overcome in the first major battle.
[00:34:54.414 --> 00:35:00.618]  That's the battle we're entering, but the biggest revival and awakening and the biggest victory ever will come after it.
[00:35:01.138 --> 00:35:08.503]  Satan wins some battles, but Satan knows he's already lost the war.
[00:35:10.364 --> 00:35:18.090]  And all we got to do in this boot camp, it's this life, is prove we've got the metal it takes to get taken to the next level.
[00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:21.732]  And believe me, believe me, you want to be there.
[00:35:22.512 --> 00:35:23.173]  I want to be there.
[00:35:24.164 --> 00:35:24.664]  It's private.
[00:35:25.525 --> 00:35:26.306]  I don't get into it.
[00:35:26.406 --> 00:35:31.009]  But if you think the things I've covered here are next level, you have not seen anything yet.
[00:35:31.229 --> 00:35:33.071]  And I know a lot of you probably seen what I've seen.
[00:35:33.892 --> 00:35:37.334]  King David talks about the quiet place, the most high.
[00:35:37.394 --> 00:35:38.775]  Others talk about the third heaven.
[00:35:40.276 --> 00:35:42.258]  You see the heavens, that's just in this dimension.
[00:35:42.278 --> 00:35:43.259]  There's the third heaven.
[00:35:44.039 --> 00:35:45.500]  And it's very, very real, my friends.
[00:35:46.241 --> 00:35:47.002]  And you want to see it.
[00:35:48.283 --> 00:35:54.868]   Now, Let's talk about something really important.
[00:35:56.629 --> 00:36:25.454]   I think as listeners and viewers you care about this broadcast is why you're here and I have become such a servant of truth that when I was pulled over a year and a half ago and it had a half bottle of sake by my house and the police said have you been drinking even though I knew I'd get arrested I had not told a lie, because I'd lied some to my parents and lied to girlfriends and stuff like that.
[00:36:25.534 --> 00:36:26.334]  I didn't like to lie.
[00:36:26.775 --> 00:36:27.795]  I was not what you call a liar.
[00:36:27.815 --> 00:36:28.796]  I'm a very faithful guy.
[00:36:28.816 --> 00:36:29.917]  I'll make a deal with you.
[00:36:29.957 --> 00:36:33.099]  I'm going to really try to fulfill it, and if I can't, I'll try to make amends.
[00:36:33.159 --> 00:36:35.360]  But, I mean, I'm like Tony Montana.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:41.063]  I got two things in this world, and that's my word and my balls, and I don't break them for anybody.
[00:36:42.624 --> 00:36:47.747]  But some would call it neurotic, but I don't think it's neurotic.
[00:36:48.368 --> 00:36:53.750]   If I lied to those police, And I get, in the military, being a spy, you're supposed to lie in the Bible.
[00:36:54.070 --> 00:36:55.270]  You can lie if you're fighting an enemy.
[00:36:55.931 --> 00:36:59.132]  I just said, you know, yeah, I had a couple of glasses of wine.
[00:36:59.853 --> 00:37:06.116]  I'm below the alcohol level, but that's what happened.
[00:37:06.136 --> 00:37:07.717]  And then I got Achilles that's gone.
[00:37:07.737 --> 00:37:09.078]  I never had the surgery.
[00:37:09.538 --> 00:37:18.543]  They wanted me to walk on this and do all that, and they said I didn't pass that test, so they took me to jail, and I was there 15 minutes later, and I blew under the alcohol level, like I told them.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.381]  Yeah, I was at a Japanese restaurant, had two glasses of sake.
[00:37:24.761 --> 00:37:28.241]  Well, I guess equivalent to a glass, I probably had like five little cups of it.
[00:37:29.102 --> 00:37:30.962]  Had zero buzz, you know, zero buzz.
[00:37:31.862 --> 00:37:35.403]  And I like to drink, I'll admit, I've been drunk plenty, but not while I'm behind the wheel of a car.
[00:37:36.103 --> 00:37:37.423]  That's going on, somebody's going to drive me.
[00:37:38.423 --> 00:37:40.824]  And they took me to jail.
[00:37:41.744 --> 00:37:43.224]  And people said, why did you lie?
[00:37:43.444 --> 00:37:47.385]  I tried when he was asking me to lie, I was like, no, I hadn't, I said, yeah, I've been drinking.
[00:37:49.656 --> 00:37:58.021]  Because I was weak, I did that, because I was strong, because I've gotten to the point where I've learned how the universe works.
[00:37:58.141 --> 00:38:07.186]  And when you don't lie, your brain is trained to not make calculations of all the lies you've told, which uses up brain space, computing power.
[00:38:07.846 --> 00:38:14.189]  When you train your brain to just be truthful, then it fires directly and it's more powerful.
[00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.771]  So see, it's a greediness that I don't like.
[00:38:17.824 --> 00:38:23.445]  Being arrested and spending the night in jail was nothing compared to lying!
[00:38:28.346 --> 00:38:42.729]  So, I'm not perfect, and I don't claim to be, and I sure have a lot of bad thoughts, but when the rubber meets the road, I've learned the secrets of the universe, and not lying, ever, is powerful.
[00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:49.992]   And that's why when I'm in these depositions, And they're such liars, and the Democratic Party running these things.
[00:38:51.194 --> 00:38:59.065]  I've been in seven depositions, gave them all our documents and all their fake suits, and they defaulted to saying we gave them nothing.
[00:38:59.285 --> 00:39:00.086]  They're liars, I'm not.
[00:39:01.167 --> 00:39:02.009]  They get on there and they go...
[00:39:04.295 --> 00:39:06.416]  You got tens of millions of dollars.
[00:39:06.896 --> 00:39:08.776]  You're not close to being bankrupt.
[00:39:09.337 --> 00:39:10.537]  You don't need all this money.
[00:39:10.777 --> 00:39:12.078]  You don't need all this stuff.
[00:39:12.738 --> 00:39:15.359]  You just got an $8 million Bitcoin donation.
[00:39:15.699 --> 00:39:16.979]  You lied on air.
[00:39:17.019 --> 00:39:17.639]  They played a clip.
[00:39:17.659 --> 00:39:20.200]  This is just last Tuesday in another deposition of the court orders.
[00:39:22.221 --> 00:39:22.841]  Total abuse.
[00:39:24.182 --> 00:39:28.403]  And I'm sitting there knowing we already spent all the money on back bills and stuff and that's not my money.
[00:39:28.823 --> 00:39:31.244]  I go, no, I don't have $2 million in my bank accounts.
[00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:33.709]  I don't have a million dollars in my bank accounts.
[00:39:34.309 --> 00:39:34.650]  Right now.
[00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:36.910]  That's not even that much money with the bills I've got.
[00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:41.151]  So, it's just so good to not be them.
[00:39:41.171 --> 00:39:45.752]  Because their whole world's trying to keep track of all their lies, and you notice they've gotten exhausted.
[00:39:46.032 --> 00:39:47.413]  They don't even try to keep track now.
[00:39:48.713 --> 00:39:52.734]  They say there's no world government, but then they announce world government on the same program.
[00:39:54.275 --> 00:39:56.855]  Or they say there's no inflation, then they blame Putin for it.
[00:39:58.596 --> 00:39:59.896]  So my mind's a computer.
[00:40:01.198 --> 00:40:02.820]  And lies are viruses.
[00:40:05.563 --> 00:40:10.087]  So my wife says, well, you really like that woman we were just talking to, but you really think, yeah, I think she's gorgeous.
[00:40:10.108 --> 00:40:12.090]  Yeah, but I'm with you and I think you're great too.
[00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:13.992]  But yeah, I think she's really amazing.
[00:40:14.032 --> 00:40:15.533]  Yeah, I was lusting after that woman.
[00:40:16.354 --> 00:40:18.576]  Instead of just lying about, oh no, I don't like how that woman looks.
[00:40:19.337 --> 00:40:20.679]  Yeah, the woman's incredibly gorgeous.
[00:40:20.699 --> 00:40:21.620]  Yeah, God made her.
[00:40:24.039 --> 00:40:32.244]  And that means you're truthful with yourself when you're wrong, it means you're truthful with your family, it means you start shooting people straight instead of lying.
[00:40:35.407 --> 00:40:57.387]   So when I tell you that we will shut down and that even these giant donations we got that were literally right on time turned out to be exactly what we needed just to continue on, when I tell you That I could sell everything I've got if we get in the hole, which I will do, and run this place for a month.
[00:40:58.269 --> 00:40:58.810]  That's the truth.
[00:41:01.437 --> 00:41:07.782]  I don't like tempting God, but people like the saying, and I'll say it, on my children, and on my soul, I'm not lying to you.
[00:41:07.802 --> 00:41:08.883]  And I can say that straight.
[00:41:09.123 --> 00:41:10.104]  That's an oath to you.
[00:41:10.924 --> 00:41:13.386]  I need your money for this war.
[00:41:13.907 --> 00:41:18.510]  We have come so far, no one, thanks to God, has delivered like we have.
[00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:23.234]  That means you, the listeners, the guests, the crew, we, this is a team effort here.
[00:41:23.534 --> 00:41:30.619]   This team has kicked New World Order ass Up and down the field like nobody else.
[00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:33.381]  I don't say that boastingly because it makes us the big enemy.
[00:41:35.903 --> 00:41:36.844]  But I'm in this fight.
[00:41:37.584 --> 00:41:38.565]  I'm not backing down.
[00:41:38.725 --> 00:41:40.026]  I'm not holding back 1%.
[00:41:43.609 --> 00:41:45.150]  But I can tell you I'll never give up.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:50.042]  I'll never sell out, but I could give out.
[00:41:50.422 --> 00:41:55.567]  And there's nothing that makes me more angry than them being so close to shutting us down.
[00:41:55.768 --> 00:41:57.669]  It makes me have nightmares.
[00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:01.709]  It pisses me off so much that I grind my teeth.
[00:42:01.709 --> 00:42:11.389]  All I want to do is speak to these people.
[00:42:11.465 --> 00:42:13.386]  They're on my back, they're on your back.
[00:42:14.206 --> 00:42:15.566]  I've got children, you've got children.
[00:42:15.606 --> 00:42:16.186]  I have empathy.
[00:42:16.507 --> 00:42:19.047]  I see stuff happen to somebody, I feel it myself.
[00:42:19.067 --> 00:42:22.988]  I don't know how these Satanists operate having no feelings, they're just idiots.
[00:42:24.989 --> 00:42:26.750]  But I have feelings and that's my strength.
[00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:29.330]  And you are my strength and I am your strength.
[00:42:30.071 --> 00:42:32.191]  And so, I need your support.
[00:42:32.451 --> 00:42:33.472]  I need your funds.
[00:42:33.732 --> 00:42:38.133]  I need you to understand that we are the tip of the spear in this war and to be all in.

[00:44:17.898 --> 00:44:18.779]  That's my idea.
[00:44:18.799 --> 00:44:21.481]  I said, men like hair and beard formulas, make that.
[00:44:22.021 --> 00:44:25.244]  All it is is a super strong vitamin mineral, good for men and women.
[00:44:25.745 --> 00:44:33.451]  And for some reason, nobody buys it, nobody wants it, even though it's just as good, maybe even better than the other Whole Foods multivitamin we came out with.
[00:44:33.911 --> 00:44:35.633]  That's another manufacturer, probably is even better.
[00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:36.434]  I'm not knocking the other one.
[00:44:37.094 --> 00:44:38.656]  That is 75% off.
[00:44:38.736 --> 00:44:42.920]  We're losing money on that, but I got to get the money in to operate.
[00:44:43.341 --> 00:44:46.944]  Hair and beard support is a multivitamin mineral for everybody.
[00:44:47.005 --> 00:44:48.967]  Children, adults, men, women, you name it.
[00:44:49.327 --> 00:44:50.708]  Infowarstore.com.

[00:44:57.836 --> 00:44:59.137]  Preparetoday.com.
[00:44:59.217 --> 00:44:59.418]  Okay.
[00:45:00.291 --> 00:45:06.194]  I got all the stuff I mentioned, your phone calls next hour, the Joe Rogan clip on what's happening with the medical tyranny and so much more.
[00:45:06.214 --> 00:45:07.955]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:45:08.175 --> 00:45:08.656]  God bless you.
[00:45:08.476 --> 00:45:22.876]  We'll be right back.
[00:45:23.164 --> 00:45:25.265]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:45:27.238 --> 00:45:32.238]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:45:32.238 --> 00:45:57.238]  [Music]
[00:45:57.238 --> 00:46:06.238]   China has recently invited Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, Egypt, and several other countries to join BRICS,
[00:46:06.238 --> 00:46:13.238]   a growing world alliance led by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
[00:46:13.747 --> 00:46:19.873]  While some are reporting that BRICS is somehow challenging the globalists, this is demonstrably false.
[00:46:20.874 --> 00:46:26.101]  The original concept for BRICS was proposed by the chief economist for Goldman Sachs.
[00:46:26.882 --> 00:46:32.929]  BRICS's new development bank is staffed by known players of the IMF and World Bank.
[00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:38.456]  And BRICS has repeatedly affirmed their commitment to the United Nations Agenda 2030.
[00:46:40.198 --> 00:46:49.320]  Aside from Brazil's President Bolsonaro, all of BRICS nation-states have pushed the COVID-19 lockdowns and experimental shots.
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:56.042]  And China recently announced five more years of their brutal zero-COVID lockdowns.
[00:46:57.282 --> 00:47:04.864]  BRICS is also pushing a digital currency and has launched a vaccine research and development center for member states.
[00:47:06.149 --> 00:47:08.615]  BRICS is clearly not anti-globalist.
[00:47:09.156 --> 00:47:15.631]  Even the CCP's state-run media explains how BRICS now leads the globalization mission.
[00:47:16.713 --> 00:47:20.514]  But they are all turning against the United States and its allies.
[00:47:21.354 --> 00:47:23.295]  Xi Jinping accused the U.S.
[00:47:23.455 --> 00:47:31.476]  of weaponizing the financial system with their sanctions against Russia, which has caused the average person to suffer worldwide.
[00:47:32.077 --> 00:47:37.218]  And Vladimir Putin suggested that BRICS could provide a new world reserve currency.
[00:47:38.378 --> 00:47:39.439]  At the recent St.
[00:47:39.539 --> 00:47:50.803]  Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin blamed the West for disrupting the international economy and announced that NATO's unipolar world order is over.
[00:47:51.644 --> 00:48:00.468]  In just three months, Russia has managed to reverse inflation and has increased their financial surplus to more than four times it was last year.
[00:48:01.568 --> 00:48:10.054]  Russia is now thriving and Putin announced that their international priority is to increase food deliveries to countries that need it the most.
[00:48:10.834 --> 00:48:20.301]  They are pouring billions into their farming communities, raised the minimum wage by 10% and provided more money to pensioners and families with children.
[00:48:21.401 --> 00:48:34.345]  He also criticized the West for choosing an economic suicidal path and having suicidal intentions, which seems to be the only explanation for what the Biden administration is doing.
[00:48:35.185 --> 00:48:43.688]  They have deliberately cut off our fuel, which will cut off our food, and they are pushing the deadly shots for every single healthy child in America.
[00:48:44.788 --> 00:48:53.292]  They have opened our borders and are pushing for a world war with a thriving nuclear power while destroying our military from within.
[00:48:53.312 --> 00:48:56.813]  The Biden administration's plan is clear.
[00:48:57.334 --> 00:48:59.515]  Destroy America from within.
[00:49:00.795 --> 00:49:04.879]  And they have amassed an army of the miserable through mass psychosis.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:14.269]  An army of ugly, insane, sexually obsessed deviants who want abortion on demand and acceptance for pedophiles.
[00:49:15.010 --> 00:49:18.834]  Psychotics who castrate their own children because it's trendy.
[00:49:19.334 --> 00:49:23.278]  And mindless drones who believe the human race needs to die.
[00:49:24.239 --> 00:49:31.901]  At what point will Americans begin to care enough to work together and do something when the nuclear bombs start falling?
[00:49:33.022 --> 00:49:40.824]  America is being mass-murdered by our own federal government, and the emerging new globalized economy will let it happen.
[00:49:41.824 --> 00:49:47.406]  Unless Americans take back control of their own government, America will soon end.
[00:49:48.066 --> 00:49:51.307]  That's the plan being executed right now.
[00:49:52.927 --> 00:49:54.928]  For InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:49:56.688 --> 00:49:59.268]  (upbeat music)
[00:49:59.268 --> 00:50:17.128]   Well, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko was already a well-known, prominent doctor
[00:50:17.128 --> 00:50:22.988]   serving thousands of patients in upstate New York, a Orthodox Jew.
[00:50:23.846 --> 00:50:43.432]  And I saw him in February and March of 2020, 30 months ago, come right out against the new world order and be fearless and have a huge effect on Trump and other leaders and put out the therapies and treatments that saved millions of lives here and millions of lives around the world.
[00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:48.995]  And I didn't know he'd already had cancer and heart surgery a bunch.
[00:50:49.175 --> 00:50:50.537]  I didn't know he'd almost died already.
[00:50:50.978 --> 00:50:54.143]  And I saw him travel all over the country and do endless interviews.
[00:50:54.664 --> 00:50:56.828]  He set the hill to die on because he knew he was killing himself.
[00:50:59.551 --> 00:51:00.812]  And I just saw the huge effect.
[00:51:00.852 --> 00:51:11.397]  And then interviewing him personally, he was so smart about depopulation and the New World Order and the Rothschilds and Rockefellers, and he called out all sections of the New World Order.
[00:51:12.377 --> 00:51:17.320]  And I just really, at a spiritual discernment level, saw the fruits of what he did.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:33.137]  But also, spiritually knew how great he was, and how he loved Christians, and how he loved Jesus, and how he really understood the 35,000 foot view.
[00:51:33.638 --> 00:51:34.438]  He was a real teacher.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:42.277]   And when I learned he died yesterday, I had to take off to work here and deal with accounting and trying to get products in the future.
[00:51:42.578 --> 00:51:47.463]  Because if we don't get product in the next few months to sell, we're screwed, okay?
[00:51:47.724 --> 00:51:51.028]  I'm not going to just sit here and beg you for donations all day to stay on air.
[00:51:51.528 --> 00:51:54.832]  Or I guess I will if I have to, but that's hard for everybody.
[00:51:57.554 --> 00:52:02.917]  When he died, it was upsetting, but it was also a life really fulfilled and that was powerful.
[00:52:03.757 --> 00:52:19.366]  And you see other examples of Dr. Zelenko in Tucker Carlson, and in Joe Rogan, and in Dr. McCullough and Mercola, and in countless other great people we've had on this show.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:26.802]  Who have gone up against a system that tries to put them in prison, that tries to take their licenses, that sues them!
[00:52:27.322 --> 00:52:41.627]  They're trying to take Dr. Peter Mercola's license, Scott and White Mailer's suing him, he's a prominent FDA scientist that's done major trials, a prominent cardiologist, he's testifying to legislatures, and they're trying to destroy him!
[00:52:41.947 --> 00:52:43.247]  Well, that's an honor!
[00:52:43.567 --> 00:52:55.758]   And let me tell you something, I am so honored to know people like Dr. Mercola, And Dr. McCullough and the Joe Rogans of the world.
[00:52:56.859 --> 00:52:59.281]  Because I've known Joe 24 years.
[00:52:59.961 --> 00:53:00.882]  I've known him really good for 20.
[00:53:02.523 --> 00:53:04.864]  I mean, we've had a lot of fun.
[00:53:05.905 --> 00:53:13.430]  And Joe was just so optimistic over the years, such a nice person, that he couldn't believe the system was this evil.
[00:53:14.851 --> 00:53:25.369]   Because if he was already successful and rich and powerful like Joe's been, a big TV star and everything since the mid-90s, Big network TV shows, you name it.
[00:53:25.589 --> 00:53:32.617]  He's like, if you have hundreds of millions of dollars and a beautiful family and America's great, why would you want to screw people over?
[00:53:32.938 --> 00:53:34.600]  Why would you want to cut people's power off?
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.041]  Why would you want to destroy the borders?
[00:53:36.362 --> 00:53:37.603]  Why would you want to ship into fentanyl?
[00:53:37.643 --> 00:53:39.225]  Why would you want to give people poison shots?
[00:53:40.787 --> 00:53:47.627]   And finally, before Joe moved to Austin about two years ago, I'm not getting into private conversations, but he said, my God, he said it on air, so I'll say this.
[00:53:48.047 --> 00:53:48.748]  Alex, you were right.
[00:53:49.228 --> 00:53:49.849]  You were dead on.
[00:53:49.889 --> 00:53:51.350]  I can't believe they're this bad.
[00:53:51.370 --> 00:54:00.777]  And he told me like a year ago, more than a year ago, he said, once your view of this shifts and you get that they're out to get us, then everything makes sense.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:13.468]  And so the journey that Joe Rogan has gone through, the journey that Tucker Carlson, he told me the same thing face to face, the journey that Dr. Zelenko went through, he used to be a big liberal.
[00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:15.109]  20 years ago.
[00:54:16.330 --> 00:54:29.001]  The journey that they've gone through is all of our journeys, and if we understand that journey, we'll know how to reach out to others that aren't totally given over to evil, who really are deceived and believe they're on the good guy team.
[00:54:29.541 --> 00:54:30.262]  Take DeSantis.
[00:54:31.683 --> 00:54:38.269]  He's not perfect in his background, but he's gotten better and better, and he's doing things I can tell you you don't do if you're part of the New World Order.
[00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:57.873]   And so the best part of my job Is that I've gotten to meet the men and the women, black, brown, white, everybody, who loves liberty and truth.
[00:54:57.973 --> 00:55:02.595]  And it has been a beautiful, beautiful experience and a great honor.
[00:55:02.875 --> 00:55:05.495]  And it really is the journey being the destination.
[00:55:06.596 --> 00:55:07.816]  Life is this big test.
[00:55:08.976 --> 00:55:12.560]  And it makes you really feel sorry for the people that have made the wrong decision.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.603]  So, let's play these back to back.
[00:55:16.685 --> 00:55:30.115]   Here's Joe Rogan saying the way they've Disparaged, legitimate scientists and legitimate doctors, who are not lockstep in agreement with him, when the system's been proven to be alive, is effing shameful.
[00:55:30.795 --> 00:55:32.796]  It's not scientific, it's political.
[00:55:33.417 --> 00:55:38.719]  And then DeSantis making statements about, these shots don't help children, they hurt children.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:40.961]  This is revolutionary.
[00:55:41.401 --> 00:56:00.038]   Because as an Infowars audience of activists on the field, in the arena, you're like, hey, tell us something we don't know, but remember, To have a DeSantis, to have a Joe Rogan, to have a Zelenko, to have a Mercola, to have all these people getting it is seismic.
[00:56:00.758 --> 00:56:01.779]  A Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:04.060]  We're winning.
[00:56:06.501 --> 00:56:07.562]  The globalists are losing.
[00:56:09.443 --> 00:56:10.904]  But in that lies the danger.
[00:56:12.244 --> 00:56:17.847]  Because as they know they're losing, they're going to pull out every stop.
[00:56:18.648 --> 00:56:19.128]  Here's the clips.
[00:56:20.629 --> 00:56:42.285]  From Peter Daszak and Anthony Fauci and all these people that were involved in the funding of this research, just the way they were framing it and the way they were disparaging legitimate scientists and legitimate doctors that were not lockstep in agreement with them, it's shameful.
[00:56:42.585 --> 00:56:43.586]  It's not scientific.
[00:56:43.626 --> 00:56:45.748]  Shameful as in people need to be in prison, maybe?
[00:56:46.468 --> 00:56:47.049]  Yeah.
[00:56:47.189 --> 00:56:50.333]  And not only that, this should be a thing.
[00:56:50.453 --> 00:56:52.515]  Rand Paul's the only one who calls him out on it.
[00:56:52.655 --> 00:56:54.217]  And he does it on a regular basis.
[00:56:54.297 --> 00:57:01.485]  And he's 100% correct in the things that he's saying about the funding of this particular type of research.
[00:57:01.786 --> 00:57:09.512]   Because when you see Fauci say that it's not gain-of-function research, But that's not true, because the NIH says it's gain-of-function research.
[00:57:09.552 --> 00:57:12.253]  They all say it now, because they want to protect their own ass.
[00:57:12.273 --> 00:57:18.316]  This is a rumor online, and I'm going to ask you a bunch of... Okay, so is Dr. Fauci's wife on the NIH?
[00:57:18.676 --> 00:57:19.877]  Isn't she like one of the heads?
[00:57:19.977 --> 00:57:20.937]  Isn't that some sort of thing?
[00:57:21.117 --> 00:57:21.677]  Let's find out.
[00:57:21.717 --> 00:57:22.678]  She does something.
[00:57:23.078 --> 00:57:25.179]  She has some function.
[00:57:25.199 --> 00:57:30.401]  And he used to be the head of the NIH during that whole AIDS thing.
[00:57:30.421 --> 00:57:30.481]  Yes.
[00:57:30.741 --> 00:57:31.381]  He's been running it.
[00:57:31.441 --> 00:57:35.083]  We're not making any comparisons to... if you make any comparisons to... Here it is.
[00:57:35.783 --> 00:57:38.144]  She's the head of the Department of Bioethics.
[00:57:38.204 --> 00:57:41.585]  It's the National Institute of Health Clinical Center.
[00:57:41.665 --> 00:57:42.545]  Yes, there it is.
[00:57:42.685 --> 00:57:47.347]  Do you think maybe this is... Well, it's... it's... It's all... it's all crazy.
[00:57:47.427 --> 00:57:56.089]  Because these people are... they have massive amounts of power to decide who gets funded, what labs get funded, and no one wants to step out of line.
[00:57:56.509 --> 00:57:58.950]  There's a crazy book that I'm in the middle of.
[00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:00.711]  It's a very controversial book.
[00:58:01.351 --> 00:58:03.591]  And it was one of those books, I'm like, God, do I want to get into this?
[00:58:04.032 --> 00:58:04.612]   Robert Kennedy Jr.' 's...
[00:58:05.732 --> 00:58:06.392]  Oh yeah!
[00:58:06.712 --> 00:58:09.393]   Robert Kennedy Jr.' 's book, The Real Anthony Fauci.
[00:58:09.813 --> 00:58:10.194]  Holy fuck!
[00:58:11.374 --> 00:58:11.674]  Yeah.
[00:58:11.814 --> 00:58:16.416]  Like, there's some stuff in that that is 100% verifiable truth.
[00:58:16.856 --> 00:58:17.136]  Yeah.
[00:58:17.156 --> 00:58:18.296]  And it's crazy.
[00:58:18.756 --> 00:58:24.858]  Our Department of Health has been very clear, the risks outweigh the benefits, and we recommend against.
[00:58:25.099 --> 00:58:26.679]  That's not the same as banning it.
[00:58:26.699 --> 00:58:29.920]  I mean, people can access it if they want to, and parents can do.
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:36.843]   But if you look at when they were doing the hearing, You had one physician say, you know, parents are really, really frightened.
[00:58:36.883 --> 00:58:38.983]  Like, we know that the risk is low.
[00:58:39.564 --> 00:58:41.124]  We're not sure how this is going to work.
[00:58:41.224 --> 00:58:43.925]  But parents are really frightened about COVID for their kids.
[00:58:44.205 --> 00:58:47.026]  And which I would say is, why would they be frightened about it?
[00:58:47.147 --> 00:58:49.247]  It's because of media hysteria.
[00:58:49.527 --> 00:58:51.828]  It's because of a lot of misinformation.
[00:58:52.168 --> 00:58:53.449]  That's why they're scared.
[00:58:55.518 --> 00:59:05.709]  But to do an emergency use for a six-month-old or a one-year-old simply to placate anxiety, that's not the standard when you're doing this.
[00:59:06.089 --> 00:59:09.093]  The standard is, is this something that's safe and effective?
[00:59:09.433 --> 00:59:13.898]  And then very importantly for recommendations, does the benefit outweigh the risk?
[00:59:14.804 --> 00:59:17.506]  But it's not about placating fear.
[00:59:17.546 --> 00:59:22.230]  It's about getting federal immunity when you start injecting children.
[00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:25.412]  It's about destroying their immune systems and taking over their lives.
[00:59:26.593 --> 00:59:26.853]  All right.
[00:59:28.275 --> 00:59:36.481]  I've got a bunch of economic news and a bunch of military news I want to hit, and a lot of transgender, post-humanist, New World Order news.
[00:59:37.202 --> 00:59:39.884]  But I also want to give the number out and take your calls.
[00:59:41.124 --> 00:59:41.945]  So that's coming up.
[00:59:42.445 --> 00:59:44.067]  I'll get the number out next segment.
[00:59:44.087 --> 00:59:44.547]  Stay with us.
[00:59:45.748 --> 01:00:01.423]  You know, I have nothing against Lee Greenwood, but when Uvalde happened a month ago, he refused to go where he was already paid to go, the NRA conference in Houston, and ran like a coward because he thought that was a good move for him personally.
[01:00:02.444 --> 01:00:06.748]  And it's cowards like that, it's cowardice acts like that, that will destroy us.
[01:00:08.015 --> 01:00:11.298]  But it's people standing up and doing the right thing when they know it's the right thing.
[01:00:11.898 --> 01:00:12.679]  They're going to save us.
[01:00:12.759 --> 01:00:13.840]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:18.704]  I intend to open the phones up and take your calls here today.
[01:00:19.765 --> 01:00:25.669]  Into the next hour, we'll also be playing some powerful Dr. Zev Zelenko clips.
[01:00:25.709 --> 01:00:29.733]  He went over to meet the next level with God.
[01:00:31.014 --> 01:00:33.556]  That is all coming up.
[01:00:34.778 --> 01:00:49.751]  In fact, I'll be taking your phone calls for first-time callers on Dr. Zev Zelenko, on the Supreme Court ruling that they can't just make law at the federal agencies to ban carbon dioxide and water vapor and cut off U.S.
[01:00:49.791 --> 01:00:57.816]   energy, how huge that is, on The other big announcements coming out of the Supreme Court as well.
[01:00:57.856 --> 01:01:08.183]  A lot of topics I want to get into, but I hope you'll call in about these specific topics with us here today because they are so incredibly important.
[01:01:09.684 --> 01:01:16.069]  We're also going to be laying out the whole transgender revolution and what that's really about.
[01:01:16.109 --> 01:01:18.411]  I want to be a trillion percent clear.
[01:01:20.575 --> 01:01:27.099]  I don't hate the people deceived by this and sucked into this and who get sterilized by this.
[01:01:27.139 --> 01:01:27.819]  They're the victims.
[01:01:31.422 --> 01:01:41.708]  I am exposing what this agenda is opening up and what its endgame is and I'll talk about that some at the start of the next segment for the big stack of news I have here and then go to your phone calls.
[01:01:43.302 --> 01:01:44.242]  But what do you make?
[01:01:44.322 --> 01:01:45.983]  This is the big question I wanted for callers.
[01:01:46.263 --> 01:01:49.224]  I was driving to the office this morning and I said, I want to take calls today.
[01:01:49.264 --> 01:01:55.387]  I may even cancel some of the guests we have, which I did, because I want to have time for calls and to memorialize Dr. Zelenko.
[01:01:55.987 --> 01:01:58.628]  And I said, what's the big question I want to ask?
[01:02:01.329 --> 01:02:03.430]  And that's basically the question.
[01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:11.673]  So we're going to be discussing all of that here today.
[01:02:13.047 --> 01:02:13.407]  On air.
[01:02:15.449 --> 01:02:16.889]  How do we override this tyranny?
[01:02:17.310 --> 01:02:18.450]  How do we defeat it together?
[01:02:19.011 --> 01:02:31.478]  How do we trigger other people to awaken to the fact that this is a globalist war to cut off our energy, destroy our borders, to destroy our infrastructure, to steal our sovereignty, to put us on this liberal New World Order?
[01:02:32.319 --> 01:02:40.764]  And so driving in, the big question was, what do you make of the White House spokesperson saying, we'll play the clip next segment?
[01:02:41.064 --> 01:02:42.445]  Hell, we'll play it going out to break.
[01:02:43.854 --> 01:02:46.796]  That this is a liberal world order.
[01:02:47.577 --> 01:02:50.499]  What do you make of it being out in the open?
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:03:06.409]  What do you make of them with one hand saying world government, global government, chips to buy and sell, cell phones to buy and sell, world social credit scores, carbon taxes, guaranteed universal incomes, end of the family, pedophilia legalized, no more nation states.
[01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:12.994]  What do you make of this agenda where you have nothing and you own nothing and they've declared war on you and your family?
[01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:17.566]  They've declared war on your very existence.
[01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:19.528]  They've said you're not essential.
[01:03:20.570 --> 01:03:23.733]  Don't you understand that everything else is window dressing?
[01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:31.663]  Everything else is rearranging deck chairs and polishing silverware and playing the violin on the deck of the sinking Titanic.
[01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:47.307]  We've got to let people know it's a corporate, world government, anti-human takeover that is antithetical to everything we do and to prosperity and to society.
[01:03:47.387 --> 01:03:54.174]  It is a corporate, anti-human takeover of the very biological processes that it is to be human.
[01:03:58.081 --> 01:04:01.843]  What do you want to say about the declaration of war against humanity?
[01:04:02.723 --> 01:04:04.864]  And what do you think the resistance should be to that?
[01:04:05.204 --> 01:04:06.525]  That's another one of the big questions.
[01:04:07.005 --> 01:04:08.906]  So the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[01:04:08.726 --> 01:04:23.766]   877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539. First-time callers, that's a giant ocean of questions.
[01:04:23.766 --> 01:04:31.846]   But how do we get people to wake up that a declaration of war has been made against them
[01:04:31.846 --> 01:04:40.244]   and their families and these globalists are running around like this White House spokesperson Brian
[01:04:40.244 --> 01:04:42.485]  Deese.
[01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.481]  Hey, what about the power prices?
[01:04:44.501 --> 01:04:45.382]  What about the oil prices?
[01:04:45.402 --> 01:04:46.443]  What about the electricity prices?
[01:04:46.803 --> 01:04:47.803]  What about the inflation?
[01:04:48.024 --> 01:04:51.466]  Well, it's the liberal world order, and it's all Russia's fault.
[01:04:54.875 --> 01:04:56.416]  Thought the New World Order didn't exist.
[01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:58.658]  I thought we were making it all up.
[01:04:59.498 --> 01:05:04.962]  So we're in this paradox where they're admitting world government, they're attacking us for our own good, but it's Putin's fault and it's our fault.
[01:05:07.144 --> 01:05:12.348]  We're going to go out to break with that 44-second clip here in just a moment, but that's the question we're raising.
[01:05:12.368 --> 01:05:12.408]  877-789-2539.
[01:05:12.428 --> 01:05:12.548]  877-789-Alex.
[01:05:12.368 --> 01:05:17.368]  877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[01:05:17.368 --> 01:05:23.588]   And then I'll take calls for an hour for the bottom of the next hour,
[01:05:23.588 --> 01:05:26.188]  an hour and 25 minutes from now.
[01:05:27.183 --> 01:05:37.367]  And then I'm going to end the show with some amazing excerpts of Dr. Zelenko, Zev Zelenko, on the broadcast.
[01:05:38.688 --> 01:05:40.228]  Dr. Vladimir Zev Zelenko.
[01:05:41.369 --> 01:05:42.209]  And what he stood for.
[01:05:42.229 --> 01:05:47.651]  Because he stood for being a trailblazer and a maverick and going against the system and standing up for humanity.
[01:05:47.971 --> 01:05:59.119]   And he's asked us, in his final words, to up our game To not back down and to die on this hill for our children in the future because God's watching.
[01:05:59.559 --> 01:06:04.140]  And I can't think of a more important message going into this July 4th weekend than that.
[01:06:07.881 --> 01:06:18.844]  I'm going to spend this July 4th weekend in reflection and focus and research and exercise my body to be healthy with my family and just recommitting how can I be the most truthful?
[01:06:19.705 --> 01:06:21.085]  How can I be the most hardcore?
[01:06:22.389 --> 01:06:23.672]  How can I be the most focused?
[01:06:23.752 --> 01:06:28.782]  How can I be an example to others of what needs to happen in the future?
[01:06:29.142 --> 01:06:31.327]  And I'm telling you, people like Dr. Peter McCullough...
[01:06:33.311 --> 01:06:45.013]  And Dr. Joseph Mercola and people like Dr. Zev Zelenko and so many others are the examples of what we need to be like and to model ourselves like.
[01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:46.293]  And I just want to say it again.
[01:06:46.453 --> 01:06:48.074]  I love this audience of activists.
[01:06:48.654 --> 01:06:49.654]  You are the tip of the spear.
[01:06:49.694 --> 01:06:51.194]  What you've done has changed the world.
[01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:57.836]  And I am so thankful for the fact that you care and you're tuned in and you're involved and you want to fix things.
[01:06:58.336 --> 01:06:59.896]  That is the spirit!
[01:07:01.408 --> 01:07:03.450]  This is going to save the world, and I am so proud of this crew.
[01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:06.172]  Let's go to this quick clip of they declare war on us.
[01:07:06.212 --> 01:07:08.254]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:08.294 --> 01:07:14.840]  They say that this could be a long war measured in years, and I think everybody understands why this is happening.
[01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.121]  But is it sustainable?
[01:07:16.142 --> 01:07:22.788]  What do you say to those families who say, listen, we can't afford to pay $4.85 a gallon for months, if not years.
[01:07:22.848 --> 01:07:24.089]  This is just not sustainable.
[01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:29.877]  Well, what you heard from the President today was a clear articulation of the stakes.
[01:07:29.957 --> 01:07:33.618]  This is about the future of the liberal world order, and we have to stand firm.
[01:07:34.238 --> 01:07:42.161]  The liberal world order means your children is castrated, you're bankrupt, you're homeless, you die, you have no future, you have no hope, humans are obsolete, humans are bad.
[01:07:42.542 --> 01:07:47.644]  We need to reject the liberal world order that is the satanic new world order.
[01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:48.304]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:49.384 --> 01:08:02.353]   Well-known filmmaker and talk show host, a good friend of mine, Jason Jones, I don't care about flying saucers.
[01:08:02.453 --> 01:08:03.774]  I don't care about little green men.
[01:08:03.794 --> 01:08:05.695]  I don't care about all that speculation.
[01:08:06.275 --> 01:08:13.119]  Everything the Democrats do is anti-human, anti-human rights, destroying our environment, destroying a human future.
[01:08:13.799 --> 01:08:15.840]  They act like an alien species taking over.
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:30.433]   Then you go to the Davos group with Harari and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and they Say, oh, a post-human world's coming, humans are bad, we've got a new human we're about to build.
[01:08:30.553 --> 01:08:32.014]  I mean, this is happening.
[01:08:32.495 --> 01:08:40.520]  And the FDA is set to approve human chimeric pigs that are part human, part pig, with organs they grow for us.
[01:08:42.242 --> 01:08:47.806]  Now the thing is, you cover that decades ago when they were developing it, you're a kook, you're a nut, you're crazy, it doesn't exist.
[01:08:49.531 --> 01:08:51.892]  But now that it's being announced, it's just in your face.
[01:08:52.672 --> 01:08:53.693]  That's the type of issue.
[01:08:53.753 --> 01:09:11.121]  So, when they tell you a man can have a baby, or a woman can be a man, or two women had a baby in state prison in California, or New Jersey, or New York, or wherever, it's about getting you to accept logical fallacies and just scramble your brain.
[01:09:11.501 --> 01:09:13.462]  And here's some of these headlines, and we'll go to your phone calls.
[01:09:15.183 --> 01:09:18.264]  First state moves to ban gender-affirming treatments for children.
[01:09:19.286 --> 01:09:25.448]  If I went to the doctor and I said, Doc, I just believe I'm a transhumanist, I shouldn't have arms.
[01:09:25.868 --> 01:09:27.068]  Will you cut my arms off?
[01:09:27.108 --> 01:09:28.469]  They'd put me in a mental institution.
[01:09:31.670 --> 01:09:41.533]  But when they say, oh, a five-year-old who got confused by his teacher wants to be a girl, we want to sign him up when he's 10 to have his balls cut off, you'd say that person was insane.
[01:09:42.486 --> 01:09:53.512]  But no, because the media and the corporations and the institutions, the schools, the universities, and the judges and the psychologists, many of them, not all of them, gaslight us.
[01:09:53.532 --> 01:09:55.993]  We go, okay, stunning and brave.
[01:09:56.614 --> 01:09:58.695]  Cut that boy's genitals off.
[01:10:01.056 --> 01:10:07.680]  State of Alabama has called on federal court to uphold a ban on so-called gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender youths.
[01:10:09.445 --> 01:10:11.026]  Which cause all sorts of medical problems.
[01:10:11.046 --> 01:10:13.326]  Look at this insane image if you're a radio listener.
[01:10:13.706 --> 01:10:14.547]  You're being spared it.
[01:10:14.567 --> 01:10:16.627]  The guy looks like a demonic chipmunk.
[01:10:17.248 --> 01:10:22.649]  Toronto police cause confusion with post about missing woman.
[01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:24.690]  I've got the post with a goatee.
[01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:26.351]  All points bulleted.
[01:10:26.371 --> 01:10:27.491]  An image of a woman.
[01:10:27.571 --> 01:10:28.952]  This is what the woman looks like.
[01:10:29.632 --> 01:10:30.432]  And it's a man.
[01:10:33.213 --> 01:10:36.434]  Here is the Toronto police press release.
[01:10:37.614 --> 01:10:38.235]  News release.
[01:10:38.315 --> 01:10:38.975]  Missing woman.
[01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:47.813]  Poll shows American belief in transgender ideology is falling.
[01:10:47.632 --> 01:10:55.032]   border defiant after beating child rivals. He's not just a woman now, he's a teenager.
[01:10:55.032 --> 01:11:01.193]  Beat the other number two 15 year old. That's on Infowars.com.
[01:11:01.193 --> 01:11:06.912]   Poll shows American belief in transgender ideologies falling. Is American belief in
[01:11:06.912 --> 01:11:13.831]   Santa Claus falling? Is American belief in the Easter Bunny falling?
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:17.801]  Is American belief in the Tooth Fairy falling?
[01:11:20.462 --> 01:11:35.589]  And again, if you're a full-grown man, and you've been effeminate your whole life, and a lot of chemicals in the food and water do blur those lines, that's actually happening, and you want to go have surgeries, and you want to go do stuff, that's your business.
[01:11:35.629 --> 01:11:38.390]  Just don't have me as a taxpayer pay for it.
[01:11:42.011 --> 01:11:44.994]  Be prepared for a massive nuclear waste crisis.
[01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:47.356]  It's official.
[01:11:47.516 --> 01:11:58.807]  As of June 19th, I now serve my nation as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Spent Fuel Waste Disposition in the Office of Nuclear Energy in the Department of Energy.
[01:11:59.508 --> 01:12:14.419]   So, the new head, the new Deputy Head of Nuclear Waste, Is a man dressed like a woman who poses in their official photo as that, complete with high heels.
[01:12:15.259 --> 01:12:19.240]  And then it's a dude that looks like a space alien with a bald head.
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:21.301]  So they don't just say they're women.
[01:12:23.022 --> 01:12:29.464]  They then blaspheme the powerful image of a woman and look like Lex Luthor.
[01:12:32.725 --> 01:12:41.443]   Complete with the red, white, and blue high heels. And it's like I've said, if you make that
[01:12:41.443 --> 01:12:43.023]  personal choice, that's your issue.
[01:12:43.023 --> 01:12:49.984]   But take Blair White. Blair White looks like a woman. And Blair White's not trying to sterilize
[01:12:49.984 --> 01:12:54.463]   little kids. And Blair White's not trying to teach kids this stuff. Blair White made that decision.
[01:12:54.463 --> 01:13:03.104]   And is a smart, nice person. I don't hate Blair White. This is a bald-headed dude saying,
[01:13:03.104 --> 01:13:08.063]   I run the nuclear waste dumps, and I'm in my office in a red jumper.
[01:13:08.063 --> 01:13:08.904]  Bye.
[01:13:08.904 --> 01:13:18.903]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:13:10.824 --> 01:13:13.125]  So again, be prepared for a massive nuclear waste crisis.
[01:13:14.405 --> 01:13:15.465]  Here's the full photo.
[01:13:16.746 --> 01:13:19.946]  This is the strutting around, pissing on our face, declaring victory over us.
[01:13:20.846 --> 01:13:21.887]  This is the aftermath.
[01:13:23.507 --> 01:13:24.247]  And it continues.
[01:13:24.267 --> 01:13:26.888]  Yep, there he is.
[01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:30.026]  That's not a woman, folks.
[01:13:30.066 --> 01:13:31.127]  That's an affront to women.
[01:13:32.748 --> 01:13:36.512]  I mean, if you're gonna say you're a woman, buddy boy, you better look like one.
[01:13:38.253 --> 01:13:39.675]  But it's about taking over the image.
[01:13:40.095 --> 01:13:42.677]  A woman is an ugly, bald-headed dude in a dress.
[01:13:43.698 --> 01:13:46.621]  Marvel Comics introducing first gay Spider-Man.
[01:13:48.662 --> 01:13:50.504]  What if Spider-Man's heterosexual?
[01:13:50.824 --> 01:13:51.945]  It's all just sexual.
[01:13:51.965 --> 01:13:52.606]  It's a sex cult.
[01:13:54.067 --> 01:13:55.709]  And it goes on from there.
[01:13:57.009 --> 01:14:04.595]  Weird new Disney show Baymax features transgender tampon scene where men use tampons.
[01:14:04.715 --> 01:14:09.599]  It's about totally screwing up our children, period.
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:15.203]  Alright, I'm going to go to break in about three minutes and I'm going to come back and take your phone calls.
[01:14:16.357 --> 01:14:27.644]  For the next 45 minutes, and then I'm going to do a memorial for Dr. Zev Zelenko, who is a real patriot and somebody we love and who is alive with us right now.
[01:14:27.664 --> 01:14:33.928]  And then we've got more of the carbon tax news all over the world just saying farming is banned, cars are going to be banned.
[01:14:33.948 --> 01:14:40.453]  They're not, they're not, they're not, out of one side of their mouth, they're like, yeah, we're banning all your cars for the earth, but it's all Putin's fault.
[01:14:41.913 --> 01:14:43.915]  That's coming up as well.
[01:14:44.929 --> 01:14:53.414]  And we've got Representative MTG calls for committee to investigate Epstein-Maxwell clients, highlights Clinton Foundation involvement.
[01:14:53.774 --> 01:14:55.215]  You talk about trailblazing.
[01:14:55.895 --> 01:14:59.617]  You talk about bravado and confidence.
[01:15:00.058 --> 01:15:02.839]  MTG just went from awesome to incredible.
[01:15:05.672 --> 01:15:07.254]  Stellar with this.
[01:15:07.314 --> 01:15:07.974]  That's coming up.
[01:15:08.535 --> 01:15:09.195]  It's all coming up.
[01:15:09.996 --> 01:15:21.506]  I want to encourage listeners while you still can because our high-quality storable food supplier has high-quality full-spectrum meals, super tasty, super nutritious, amazing quality, ready to ship to you right now.
[01:15:23.088 --> 01:15:29.954]  I didn't promote storable food for three months because all the other suppliers are out and our big supplier was a few weeks behind.
[01:15:29.994 --> 01:15:30.755]  I said we're stopping.
[01:15:32.022 --> 01:15:41.909]  They're ready to ship right now, and they have air filtration, water filtration, hundreds of great preparedness items interfaced directly with them so it ships to you within days.

[01:15:44.591 --> 01:15:48.333]  PrepareToday.com.
[01:15:48.894 --> 01:15:49.854]  Important decision.
[01:15:50.475 --> 01:15:53.897]  You buy food now with inflation going up, and I guarantee it's only going to go up.
[01:15:54.458 --> 01:16:00.302]  You talk about a win-win situation, get high quality, affordable food, support the broadcast, get the best deal, and beat inflation.
[01:16:01.445 --> 01:16:03.567]  Only way you lose is not taking action.
[01:16:03.707 --> 01:16:04.648]  I got storable food.
[01:16:04.728 --> 01:16:05.789]  I got it for friends and family.
[01:16:05.829 --> 01:16:08.331]  I got more than I even need because I want to be prepared.
[01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:09.592]  I got a generator.
[01:16:09.852 --> 01:16:10.592]  I got a shotgun.
[01:16:10.612 --> 01:16:11.193]  I got a rifle.
[01:16:11.213 --> 01:16:12.294]  I got a four-wheel drive.
[01:16:13.216 --> 01:16:14.736]  because a country boy can't survive.
[01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:15.896]  You need this.
[01:16:15.896 --> 01:16:18.256]  PrepareToday.com, PrepareToday.com.
[01:16:18.256 --> 01:16:25.176]   And then the biggest sale of the year yet is the July 4th mega super sale.
[01:16:25.176 --> 01:16:32.775]   Double Patriot points, 40% to 75% off on the fish oil, the krill oil, the multivitamins,
[01:16:32.775 --> 01:16:40.336]   the immune support, the alveopower, the pollen block, the vitamin D3 gummies,
[01:16:40.336 --> 01:16:44.414]   the Ultra 12 finally back in stock, 40% -- oh, 50% of them, excuse me.
[01:16:44.829 --> 01:16:47.331]  All 40 to 60% off.

[01:16:54.177 --> 01:16:54.898]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:05.287]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying, and that's why they run the fake headline against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day.
[01:17:06.127 --> 01:17:07.789]  Jones admits he's an actor.
[01:17:08.650 --> 01:17:11.031]  Or Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:13.073]  Where do we say that?
[01:17:13.393 --> 01:17:14.094]  We never said that.
[01:17:14.154 --> 01:17:16.436]  They just say we said that.
[01:17:17.714 --> 01:17:18.494]  But where's the clip?
[01:17:18.774 --> 01:17:19.695]  Where's the article?
[01:17:19.915 --> 01:17:20.615]  Where do we say that?
[01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:21.735]  It doesn't exist.
[01:17:22.276 --> 01:17:26.337]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[01:17:26.677 --> 01:17:29.558]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[01:17:29.758 --> 01:17:33.860]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.221]  He's actually a performance artist.
[01:17:36.421 --> 01:17:37.681]  He's a performance artist.
[01:17:38.041 --> 01:17:39.222]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[01:17:39.882 --> 01:17:43.486]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid.
[01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:48.271]  And it's all based on the custody battle with my ex-wife five years ago.
[01:17:48.291 --> 01:17:56.119]  And she was trying to put into evidence me dressed up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic, saying, take your Prozac, kids.
[01:17:56.179 --> 01:17:57.460]  Take your illegal drugs, too.
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:58.501]  You'll die.
[01:17:58.541 --> 01:17:59.122]  It's fun.
[01:17:59.502 --> 01:18:01.184]  So people wouldn't take drugs.
[01:18:02.253 --> 01:18:05.674]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence and say, look, he's insane telling kids to use drugs.
[01:18:06.294 --> 01:18:12.536]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson.
[01:18:12.556 --> 01:18:14.817]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander.
[01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:16.398]  Hail Cobra!
[01:18:16.698 --> 01:18:17.618]  Or Optimus Prime.
[01:18:17.838 --> 01:18:19.539]  Autobots, let's roll!
[01:18:19.899 --> 01:18:22.460]  Or the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all really good.
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:23.640]  Or Darth Vader.
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.101]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[01:18:26.961 --> 01:18:30.042]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[01:18:31.508 --> 01:18:32.909]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[01:18:33.090 --> 01:18:33.350]  No.
[01:18:33.370 --> 01:18:36.853]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Cobra Commander, The Joker?
[01:18:36.913 --> 01:18:37.094]  No.
[01:18:37.394 --> 01:18:44.561]  And clearly, no reasonable person would think when I'm doing satire that what I'm saying is what I really think.
[01:18:45.261 --> 01:18:46.723]  No one believes the Babylon Bee.
[01:18:47.043 --> 01:18:49.686]  It's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[01:18:50.006 --> 01:18:51.808]  Buy the Vaccinate Me Elmo doll today.
[01:18:52.188 --> 01:18:53.810]  It's required by the CDC.
[01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:55.231]  But they play those games.
[01:18:56.292 --> 01:18:58.453]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[01:18:58.934 --> 01:19:07.119]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[01:19:07.759 --> 01:19:09.580]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[01:19:10.081 --> 01:19:11.342]  That man's a threat to this country.
[01:19:11.602 --> 01:19:13.663]  And they go, look, he admitted in court he's an actor.
[01:19:13.903 --> 01:19:16.405]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly.
[01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:18.006]  I was an actor in Waking Life.
[01:19:18.406 --> 01:19:21.188]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[01:19:23.369 --> 01:19:31.835]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to you isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying.
[01:19:31.855 --> 01:19:32.616]  And you know that!
[01:19:33.276 --> 01:19:34.397]  You're insulted right now.
[01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:35.658]  I'm even explaining that to you.
[01:19:35.998 --> 01:19:39.841]  And so am I. But that's who these people are.
[01:19:40.962 --> 01:19:45.205]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[01:19:45.325 --> 01:19:46.406]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[01:19:47.759 --> 01:19:49.300]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.400]  He's smart.
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:51.961]  He's funny as hell.
[01:19:52.041 --> 01:19:53.101]  He's truly funny.
[01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:54.921]  I'm kind of retarded.
[01:19:55.921 --> 01:20:01.921]  [Screaming]
[01:20:01.921 --> 01:20:09.921]   Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what I say about other things
[01:20:09.921 --> 01:20:14.921]   when I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola on InfoWars.com
[01:20:14.921 --> 01:20:19.921]   that has all the cited information, the latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome?
[01:20:20.312 --> 01:20:21.813]  No, that's a real thing.
[01:20:22.574 --> 01:20:24.995]  That's something happening in the real world.
[01:20:25.656 --> 01:20:27.297]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:29.398]  I am Alex Jones.
[01:20:30.196 --> 01:20:31.957]  And I am the guy on this show every day.
[01:20:32.517 --> 01:20:33.358]  I am an American.
[01:20:33.797 --> 01:20:38.997]   And that's what I promote is freedom and justice and liberty and they can't stand it.
[01:20:38.997 --> 01:20:49.556]  It's Friday, July 1st.
[01:20:49.748 --> 01:20:51.209]  Pesky earth creatures!
[01:20:54.031 --> 01:20:57.333]  All right, for the next 40-something minutes, let's take your phone calls.
[01:20:57.933 --> 01:20:59.634]  We're doing a great job lately taking the calls.
[01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:01.695]  We're going to go bam, bam, bam through your calls.
[01:21:02.376 --> 01:21:09.660]  Let's talk to Mark in Florida, then Sam, CJ, Leroy Jr., Luke, Dave, Robert, Kevin, Abraham, Matt.
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:11.981]  But first up, Mark in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:21:13.362 --> 01:21:15.483]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[01:21:15.624 --> 01:21:17.805]  First-time caller, longtime listener.
[01:21:18.245 --> 01:21:21.427]  I'm a self-employed 66-year-old senior.
[01:21:22.441 --> 01:21:34.132]  Who last November moved from the suburbs of Detroit to leave the Nazi governor, moved to the panhandle of Florida, and at the time my family and friends thought I'd lost my mind.
[01:21:34.292 --> 01:21:36.474]  They no longer think that way, but at the time they did.
[01:21:37.415 --> 01:21:39.337]  And I want to say God bless you.
[01:21:39.597 --> 01:21:40.318]  Stay on the air.
[01:21:40.538 --> 01:21:41.699]  The devil is a liar.
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:44.502]  I'm going to plug one of your products.
[01:21:45.347 --> 01:21:53.974]  I listen all the time and I heard this guy talking about the iodine supplement X2 saying, well, he's been taking it, his memory is getting better and he's having dreams and I'm like, yeah, maybe.
[01:21:54.655 --> 01:21:57.256]  So I had to go back to Michigan for three weeks for business.
[01:21:57.757 --> 01:22:05.082]  I came back and for a week I had massive sinus headache, massive sinus condition and an earache that was driving me nuts.
[01:22:05.223 --> 01:22:06.724]  I said, you know what, I'm going to try the X2.
[01:22:06.744 --> 01:22:07.484]  I had just gotten it.
[01:22:08.565 --> 01:22:10.927]  Two days later, earache was gone.
[01:22:11.621 --> 01:22:12.742]  Dinosaurs were cleared.
[01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:13.843]  No headaches.
[01:22:14.083 --> 01:22:15.464]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:22:15.564 --> 01:22:16.945]  The stuff is real.
[01:22:17.065 --> 01:22:17.566]  It works.
[01:22:18.166 --> 01:22:20.428]  So anyways, I want to thank you for all that.
[01:22:20.908 --> 01:22:22.029]  Two questions I have.
[01:22:23.650 --> 01:22:29.295]  Why did SCOTUS give Biden a win with the stay in Mexico policy?
[01:22:29.415 --> 01:22:30.616]  I'm trying to understand that one.
[01:22:30.636 --> 01:22:31.837]  I'm scratching my head on that one.
[01:22:31.897 --> 01:22:40.944]  And my second question is with the red wave coming, the GOP have done absolutely nothing in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona.
[01:22:41.403 --> 01:22:42.811]  Nevada and Georgia.
[01:22:43.464 --> 01:22:45.745]  To fix what happened in 2020.
[01:22:46.205 --> 01:22:47.705]  How do we overcome that?
[01:22:47.765 --> 01:22:52.387]  Those are two concerns I have and I don't see any clarity on those issues.
[01:22:52.867 --> 01:22:53.947]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[01:22:54.027 --> 01:22:56.468]  I don't trust the Supreme Court as far as I can throw them.
[01:22:57.128 --> 01:23:03.030]  They've made good rulings on Christian Liberty, First Amendment, being able to pray if you want individually.
[01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:04.571]  That's not state-run religion.
[01:23:05.331 --> 01:23:11.633]  They've had a great Roe v. Wade, a great Second Amendment ruling, a great carbon banning EPA ruling.
[01:23:12.827 --> 01:23:18.393]  But then, why would they say the President can't say migrants have to stay in Mexico while they seek asylum?
[01:23:18.733 --> 01:23:23.378]  Now they just let them in and turn them loose and 95% or more never come back to the court hearings.
[01:23:23.418 --> 01:23:25.580]  So that's a bad ruling by the Supreme Court.
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.602]  I would ask you, why do you think they did that, Mark?
[01:23:28.203 --> 01:23:29.624]  That's a great question.
[01:23:29.444 --> 01:23:33.444]  and neocons trying to sabotage our populist revolution.
[01:23:33.444 --> 01:23:36.444]   They're bigger enemies than the Democrats at the end of the day.
[01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:38.444]  So yeah, that's one of the big threats we face.
[01:23:38.444 --> 01:23:41.444]   Let me ask you briefly then, why do you think the Supreme Court did that?
[01:23:41.444 --> 01:23:45.444]  In an ocean of good decisions, why that bad decision?
[01:23:45.444 --> 01:23:48.444]  That's a great question.
[01:23:48.444 --> 01:23:53.444]   I've been vacillating back and forth trying to scratch my head saying how did that happen?
[01:23:53.444 --> 01:23:57.444]   Because my understanding is, and again I'm no expert, but I thought international law was
[01:23:57.444 --> 01:24:04.444]   whatever the first country a migrant, illegal, whatever you want to tag them as, lands in,
[01:24:05.262 --> 01:24:13.725]  International law says that's where they have to be processed and stayed, yet the cartels in Mexico are allowing them to continue to flood over the border.
[01:24:13.745 --> 01:24:29.711]   So, as far as I'm concerned, with Roberts having pictures of him hanging with the Epstein crowd in college, I think we've got a situation within the Supreme Court that's bought and paid for that goes to the political realm of No, I hear you, but then why would they make the good decisions?
[01:24:29.751 --> 01:24:30.551]  That's the paradox.
[01:24:30.592 --> 01:24:31.712]  Thanks for the call, great points.
[01:24:32.473 --> 01:24:34.515]  Let's go to Kevin in Colorado.
[01:24:34.535 --> 01:24:36.256]  Says a massive shift is happening.
[01:24:36.656 --> 01:24:37.157]  I agree.
[01:24:37.777 --> 01:24:39.398]  How would you define that massive shift?
[01:24:40.659 --> 01:24:42.301]  The shift has been insane, Alex.
[01:24:42.381 --> 01:24:48.866]  I've been an Uber driver for seven years, currently I'm in Denver, and usually I feel like I'm surrounded by a bunch of liberals and snowflakes.
[01:24:49.744 --> 01:24:52.445]  The last couple months has been an insane shift.
[01:24:52.585 --> 01:25:01.908]  All I have to do is mention high gas prices and everyone comes in talking about the New World Order, tuning into InfoWars, talking about Owen Schroyer, Tim Pool, Tucker Carlson.
[01:25:01.988 --> 01:25:09.630]  The people are shifting and they're waking up in the masses and it's really beautiful to see, but the work is just getting started, I feel like.
[01:25:10.478 --> 01:25:11.379]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:25:11.399 --> 01:25:12.800]  You know, we didn't play this this hour.
[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:14.942]  I think we did play it again.
[01:25:14.962 --> 01:25:22.347]  Maybe we'll play it going out to break, but White House spokesperson says, yeah, gas prices are part of a liberal New World Order, a transition.
[01:25:22.668 --> 01:25:23.588]  They're admitting it.
[01:25:25.210 --> 01:25:25.870]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.671]  It's insane.
[01:25:26.791 --> 01:25:28.472]  I mean, no one is going to go along with this.
[01:25:28.672 --> 01:25:29.573]  Everyone's waking up.
[01:25:29.913 --> 01:25:32.555]  I talked to a guy yesterday who's growing a garden in his backyard.
[01:25:32.575 --> 01:25:33.156]  He's prepping.
[01:25:33.176 --> 01:25:34.277]  He's getting storable food.
[01:25:34.757 --> 01:25:40.172]   I talked to a woman from Cuba, I talked to another woman from Venezuela and they're
[01:25:40.172 --> 01:25:42.822]   both just like, "How do people not see this coming?
[01:25:42.822 --> 01:25:43.822]  This is what starts communism.
[01:25:43.822 --> 01:25:44.821]  This is what collapses countries.
[01:25:44.821 --> 01:25:45.821]  We're the last free country."
[01:25:45.821 --> 01:25:46.821]  By the way, since you mentioned that, it's in my stack.
[01:25:46.821 --> 01:25:47.821]  I can't find it.
[01:25:47.821 --> 01:25:48.821]  I'll try to find it in the break.
[01:25:48.821 --> 01:25:49.821]   There's footage now in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, where peaceful demonstrators show
[01:25:49.821 --> 01:25:50.821]   up with Canadian flags on the street and the police slam their head in the ground and beat
[01:25:50.821 --> 01:25:51.821]  them up.
[01:25:51.821 --> 01:26:05.302]  Try to find it.
[01:26:05.670 --> 01:26:07.151]  Trudeau has banned demonstrating.
[01:26:08.092 --> 01:26:16.219]  Then I have footage and photo of them executing that famous Cuban farmer that wouldn't hand his property over to Fidel Castro.
[01:26:16.239 --> 01:26:17.620]  So they gave him a four minute trial.
[01:26:18.441 --> 01:26:20.182]  Che Guevara did and they executed him.
[01:26:20.582 --> 01:26:22.004]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:26:22.504 --> 01:26:24.846]  I mean, the new North Korea is Canada, brother.
[01:26:24.906 --> 01:26:25.867]  We have got a problem.
[01:26:27.003 --> 01:26:28.384]  One of my good friends is from Canada.
[01:26:28.424 --> 01:26:29.344]  He's kind of a liberal.
[01:26:29.364 --> 01:26:33.126]  He's met Trudeau before and he just refuses to wake up.
[01:26:33.546 --> 01:26:37.469]  He comes to America and he looks around and sees all these American flags and he doesn't understand it.
[01:26:37.749 --> 01:26:39.970]  He says, you know, why is there so many American flags everywhere?
[01:26:39.990 --> 01:26:40.950]  He's like offended by it.
[01:26:41.291 --> 01:26:41.871]  Disgusting.
[01:26:42.071 --> 01:26:45.793]  Well, that's people pretending under Stockholm Syndrome they're part of the power structure.
[01:26:45.813 --> 01:26:47.254]  Kevin, powerful call.
[01:26:47.454 --> 01:26:47.934]  I agree.
[01:26:48.034 --> 01:26:48.995]  I'm seeing what you're seeing.
[01:26:49.495 --> 01:26:50.675]  Mass awakening.
[01:26:50.996 --> 01:26:54.898]  Tell folks the freedom lives, the resistance is at InfoWars.com.
[01:26:55.598 --> 01:27:03.509]  We're gonna go to break, come back next hour with Sam, CJ, Leroy, Junior, Luke, Dave, Robert, Abraham, Matt, all of you, the order they received.
[01:27:03.549 --> 01:27:10.559]  But here is the White House spokesperson saying all of this is for your own good, it's part of a liberal New World Order.
[01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:16.232]  They say that this could be a long war, measured in years.
[01:27:16.332 --> 01:27:19.255]  And I think everybody understands why this is happening.
[01:27:19.315 --> 01:27:20.536]  But is it sustainable?
[01:27:20.556 --> 01:27:27.201]  What do you say to those families who say, listen, we can't afford to pay $4.85 a gallon for months, if not years.
[01:27:27.261 --> 01:27:28.522]  This is just not sustainable.
[01:27:30.344 --> 01:27:34.287]  Well, what you heard from the president today was a clear articulation of the stakes.
[01:27:34.387 --> 01:27:37.670]  This is about the future of the liberal world order, and we have to stand...
[01:27:38.504 --> 01:27:42.266]  All right, we're taking your phone calls right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:27:44.427 --> 01:27:46.508]  And I'm going to show this clip again coming up later.
[01:27:47.269 --> 01:27:48.609]  The picture won the Pulitzer Prize in 1960.
[01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:54.752]  It shows a priest giving the last rites to a Cuban farmer, owner of his land.
[01:27:54.832 --> 01:27:56.593]  Months later, they banned the Catholic Church.
[01:27:57.194 --> 01:27:58.795]  He refused to work for Castro's regime.
[01:27:58.835 --> 01:28:02.817]  He died by firing squad after a trial by Che Guevara that lasted four minutes.
[01:28:03.437 --> 01:28:05.278]  You will never see this picture on a t-shirt.
[01:28:07.366 --> 01:28:09.087]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[01:28:09.107 --> 01:28:15.550]  We've got some key clips of Dr. Zev Zelenka, who died yesterday, coming up this hour.
[01:28:16.731 --> 01:28:22.273]  Let's go ahead and go to the callers in the order that they are received.
[01:28:23.534 --> 01:28:27.296]  And let's talk to Dave in Georgia.
[01:28:27.356 --> 01:28:28.276]  You're on the air, Dave.
[01:28:29.997 --> 01:28:30.878]  Hey, Alex, you there?
[01:28:31.058 --> 01:28:31.338]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:32.555 --> 01:28:35.516]  Okay, so I am a cultural anthropologist.
[01:28:36.096 --> 01:28:46.940]  In 2011, I did my dissertation and my thesis, and my professor worked for the CDC here in Atlanta, worked for the CDC in Atlanta for 30 years.
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:53.322]  And you had a caller that called in a week and a half ago when you were asking about what is the main problem.
[01:28:54.142 --> 01:29:00.964]  And I look at two issues in regards to geoengineering and the gay pride stuff.
[01:29:01.630 --> 01:29:07.495]  And all of the Drag Queen story time and all of that stuff, we can step aside from that and we can fight it.
[01:29:08.155 --> 01:29:11.198]  But the geoengineering stuff, it's so in our face.
[01:29:11.738 --> 01:29:16.782]  And my father died from COVID last year, and my mother's got a new boyfriend.
[01:29:16.822 --> 01:29:17.263]  He died at 86.
[01:29:18.344 --> 01:29:21.906]  And her new boyfriend, she's 70 years old, has got an airplane.
[01:29:22.867 --> 01:29:27.491]  And he took me flying in his airplane over Stone Mountain a month ago.
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:32.100]   And when we were flying in the airplane, the traffic controllers were like, "Hey, y'all
[01:29:32.100 --> 01:29:37.019]   gotta get away from this airplane coming in before you land in the Peete Street Airport
[01:29:37.019 --> 01:29:40.980]  for some, I couldn't even understand it, for some X reason."
[01:29:40.980 --> 01:29:42.220]  And I asked him, I said, "What does that mean?"
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:47.579]   He goes, "Oh, that's an unmarked airplane and we had to fly around it."
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:53.024]  And then when we landed, we saw they were just spraying cross lines of all this poison over us in the sky.
[01:29:53.084 --> 01:29:57.266]  It's all declassified, giant geoengineering program, CIA admits it.
[01:29:57.787 --> 01:30:00.308]  Just like, oh, there's no world government, but there is a world government.
[01:30:00.348 --> 01:30:01.409]  Yeah, it's just all in our face.
[01:30:02.679 --> 01:30:03.079]  Yes, sir.
[01:30:03.620 --> 01:30:27.101]  And, you know, being in the studies with my professor in school, he told me that he was flown to Vietnam during the Vietnam War and how it was declassified in 2004, that they came out and said that they did cloud seed the skies during the Vietnam War to drown out and cause rain supply issues to the supply lines in the war.
[01:30:27.321 --> 01:30:31.504]  You can see my doctor Ben Livingston interviews at Bandot Video in 2004.
[01:30:31.725 --> 01:30:33.446]  They declassified that.
[01:30:33.806 --> 01:30:36.328]  They were weather controlling in World War II.
[01:30:37.949 --> 01:31:03.042]   Well he laughed about it and you know this is a side issue and he said he told us he said David you don't have to believe in evolution but you got to know it and we have diseases known all the way back to 2,000 years ago at the time of Jesus that we're weaponizing now and This issue in regards to me being in Vietnam, we were trying to save the soldiers that were dying from dehydration, but he even admitted it.
[01:31:03.062 --> 01:31:11.689]  He said, I saw them deploying their geoengineering tactics back then and I didn't understand what the gridlines were, but it's just so in our face, man.
[01:31:14.468 --> 01:31:15.169]  That's the thing.
[01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:16.952]  They treat us like animals.
[01:31:17.013 --> 01:31:19.076]  The globalists have decided they're a new species.
[01:31:19.116 --> 01:31:20.158]  They've decided they're God.
[01:31:20.519 --> 01:31:22.001]  They're using us as guinea pigs.
[01:31:22.402 --> 01:31:23.925]  I really appreciate your call, Dave.
[01:31:24.947 --> 01:31:25.287]  All right.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.540]  We got a lot of callers here.
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:28.261]  No more calls.
[01:31:28.641 --> 01:31:29.301]  We'll take these.
[01:31:29.381 --> 01:31:41.845]  I'm going to get to Matt and Abraham and Robert and Andrew and Luke and Junior and Anderson and Leroy and CJ and Joe.
[01:31:42.326 --> 01:31:44.146]  I will get to every one of those calls.
[01:31:44.806 --> 01:31:49.917]   But in the last segment, I've got the last time Zlinko was on with us.
[01:31:50.077 --> 01:31:51.638]  Very powerful segment I'm going to air.
[01:31:52.078 --> 01:31:55.080]  And I've got a short clip of Zlinko coming up after the break.
[01:31:55.500 --> 01:31:57.981]  Because he was a great guy and he's alive with us today.
[01:31:58.461 --> 01:32:01.203]  We know he's at the next level, but he lives with us on today.
[01:32:01.223 --> 01:32:03.043]  He asks us to step up our game.
[01:32:03.644 --> 01:32:04.964]  He asks us to take action.
[01:32:05.024 --> 01:32:06.105]  We are doing it.
[01:32:06.505 --> 01:32:07.946]  Not just for him, but for the children.
[01:32:08.286 --> 01:32:08.986]  We'll be right back.
[01:32:09.006 --> 01:32:10.307]  Infowars.com.
[01:32:10.747 --> 01:32:11.447]  Share that link.
[01:32:11.467 --> 01:32:12.588]  They can't stand it when you do.
[01:32:13.048 --> 01:32:13.829]  Infowars.com.
[01:32:16.007 --> 01:32:21.668]  I just came from my doctor's and not good news.
[01:32:22.589 --> 01:32:30.071]  My cancer, which I've been fighting for four years, has progressed.
[01:32:31.611 --> 01:32:37.413]  There's one last ditch effort that may lead to cure, which I'm going to do.
[01:32:38.393 --> 01:32:43.074]  But if that fails, then the estimates are unpleasant.
[01:32:43.707 --> 01:32:47.470]  But I've been at this place multiple times in the last four years.
[01:32:48.811 --> 01:32:54.856]  And so when someone lives with that consciousness, something happens.
[01:32:55.476 --> 01:32:56.437]  Something very good happens.
[01:32:57.418 --> 01:33:02.582]  You kind of live each day and you appreciate time.
[01:33:03.662 --> 01:33:09.167]  And in reality, just think of it philosophically, you begin to die from the day you're born.
[01:33:11.208 --> 01:33:12.169]  No one lives forever.
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:20.265]  Some people live 20 years, some people live 100 years, but in the grand scheme of creation, it's finer.
[01:33:22.026 --> 01:33:25.809]  So in my opinion, it's not important when and how you die.
[01:33:27.891 --> 01:33:30.633]  It's much more important how you live.
[01:33:30.813 --> 01:33:35.217]  And so, because when and how you die is not in your control.
[01:33:36.838 --> 01:33:40.461]  But how you live is in your control.
[01:33:41.221 --> 01:33:46.783]   How you think, How you speak and how you act is within the free will and volition of man.
[01:33:48.003 --> 01:33:57.145]  So my advice to people is appreciate the gift of consciousness in life that you're being given.
[01:33:58.205 --> 01:34:02.246]  Happy birthday because every instant of time is an active recreation.
[01:34:02.626 --> 01:34:07.286]  It's a dynamic involvement on God's part for us to be.
[01:34:08.367 --> 01:34:13.849]   If you woke up, that's proof That he wants you to be and that you didn't finish your job.
[01:34:15.910 --> 01:34:28.219]  And I would say the world will be redeemed or fixed, rectified through acts of goodness and kindness.
[01:34:29.300 --> 01:34:33.543]  Even if the sword is on your neck, you should never give up hope.
[01:34:34.758 --> 01:34:47.401]  I do feel the sword on my neck, but I'm still very hopeful and I live with more tranquility and serenity than I've ever had in my life, which is very counterintuitive.
[01:34:47.461 --> 01:34:57.803]  Because for the carnage and the malevolence, evil that I've come into contact with in the last two years, I would not expect that type of inner peace.
[01:34:57.863 --> 01:35:09.075]   But what I've realized is When you're in alignment, you seem to be in alignment to the divine will, there's a certain gift of tranquility that's given.
[01:35:11.603 --> 01:35:12.864]  It's not easy, by the way.
[01:35:12.924 --> 01:35:14.205]  It's very hard, but so what?
[01:35:15.185 --> 01:35:20.168]  And it's a constant struggle, but all the suffering that I went through, I still wouldn't give it up.
[01:35:20.188 --> 01:35:26.672]  By the way, I didn't ask for this challenge, but no one asked me, so as I went through it, I am going through it.
[01:35:27.412 --> 01:35:30.694]  The serenity is really something I've been seeking my whole life.
[01:35:31.375 --> 01:35:38.459]  I'm very graceful to have it.
[01:35:38.479 --> 01:35:40.220]  Listen, we need generals.
[01:35:40.891 --> 01:35:49.136]  We need people with platforms like Joe Rogan and other people like that who are free-thinking spirits, but don't buy into the false narrative.
[01:35:49.757 --> 01:35:54.240]  They're able to kind of dig out the truth themselves, and they have the trust of the people.
[01:35:55.200 --> 01:35:56.161]  So this is the key here.
[01:35:56.201 --> 01:35:57.402]  This is a narrative war.
[01:35:57.862 --> 01:36:00.684]  The enemies of humanity have control over the social media.
[01:36:00.724 --> 01:36:04.947]  They have a head start in social media and mainstream media, but we can catch up.
[01:36:05.007 --> 01:36:25.711]   And a little truth, a little light, It dispenses a lot of darkness, so I plead on people like Joe and Rogan and other people with platforms to wake up, join together as an army of truth speakers and say no to these animals and these despots and save as many people as we can with spreading the truth.
[01:36:26.271 --> 01:36:28.233]  The soul of humanity is at stake here.
[01:36:30.888 --> 01:36:35.370]  I have thousands, hundreds, probably thousands of sick patients with no treatment.
[01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:37.571]  So what are you supposed to do, let them die?
[01:36:38.091 --> 01:36:40.332]  The whole, the government was telling us to send them home.
[01:36:40.652 --> 01:36:41.972]  The government is still telling us.
[01:36:42.133 --> 01:36:49.816]  NIH, as of today, tells you don't treat COVID, go home, then go to the hospital, and if the oxygen is less than 92, then you should be treated.
[01:36:50.436 --> 01:36:52.557]  That's a policy of a government that wants you to die.
[01:36:53.217 --> 01:36:58.139]  Any policy that obstructs early pre-hospital treatment is a policy of death.
[01:37:00.681 --> 01:37:05.285]  And I'm sorry to say this, but I have to be realistic and I have to protect humanity.
[01:37:05.345 --> 01:37:17.195]  I feel I have to let the world know that we are being slaughtered by a few sociopathic corrupt oligarchs and corrupt governments and false promises.
[01:37:17.595 --> 01:37:21.419]  And we need to stop listening to these people saying no.
[01:37:25.502 --> 01:37:28.585]  I'm not going to let you kill me or my family and the people I love.
[01:37:29.605 --> 01:37:29.905]  No!
[01:37:30.886 --> 01:37:33.488]  And come to my house and try to put a shot into my arm.
[01:37:33.528 --> 01:37:34.569]  Let's see what happens to you.
[01:37:34.809 --> 01:37:35.850]  You'll get a different shot.
[01:37:36.051 --> 01:37:51.063]  The difference between us and Australia now, where they're building gulags already, and then turning people into quarantine facilities, and putting ankle braces on people who don't want to take the shot, is that we have thrown in a 50 million gun.
[01:37:51.203 --> 01:37:51.804]  Powerful.
[01:37:52.734 --> 01:37:53.854]  Good to be on the air.
[01:37:53.713 --> 01:38:00.713]   at FOLWARS.COM with Dr. Zelinske. Dr. Zelinske who's made the jump into hyperspace.
[01:38:00.713 --> 01:38:04.713]  We love you Dr. Zelinko.
[01:38:04.713 --> 01:38:08.713]  Alright we're going back to your phone calls right now.
[01:38:08.713 --> 01:38:10.713]  Who's up next here?
[01:38:10.713 --> 01:38:16.713]   I guess that would be Luke in Tennessee. Luke you're on the air, welcome.
[01:38:16.713 --> 01:38:19.713]  Good to be on the air, how you doing today?
[01:38:19.713 --> 01:38:20.713]  Man, crazy times.
[01:38:20.847 --> 01:38:23.209]  They're announcing world government and it's liberal.
[01:38:24.971 --> 01:38:26.172]  Yeah, liberal world order.
[01:38:26.212 --> 01:38:29.295]  I want to talk to everybody about what we can do about that announcement.
[01:38:29.876 --> 01:38:34.400]  And the first thing I think that people need to do is admit the problem.
[01:38:34.941 --> 01:38:39.525]  You need to admit that there is a hostile world government takeover.
[01:38:39.646 --> 01:38:41.968]  It is a very scary thing to admit.
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:44.121]  That these people want you dead.
[01:38:44.621 --> 01:38:46.302]  They do not want you to have a family.
[01:38:46.502 --> 01:38:48.342]  They want an anti-human future.
[01:38:48.743 --> 01:38:56.586]  They are going to try to starve you out by reducing energy, reducing crop yields, and creating war.
[01:38:56.626 --> 01:38:57.866]  They're going to try to kill you.
[01:38:58.026 --> 01:39:00.127]  You have to admit that to yourself, number one.
[01:39:00.387 --> 01:39:00.707]  That's right.
[01:39:00.727 --> 01:39:03.088]  They're in direct war against humanity.
[01:39:03.609 --> 01:39:04.849]  On record, they are the enemy.
[01:39:05.289 --> 01:39:09.311]  Anybody endorsing Great Reset, Build Back Better, is a literal enemy of humanity.
[01:39:10.751 --> 01:39:19.398]  Now that's hard for a lot of people to deal with, but once you get past that, it is very freeing, and instead of panicking, you just need to become the solution.
[01:39:19.958 --> 01:39:23.861]  And the first thing you need to do is to secure yourself and your family.
[01:39:24.342 --> 01:39:27.604]  So you just need to prepare for the pain that they're going to try to give you.
[01:39:27.985 --> 01:39:31.607]  Because just because they say they want to do this doesn't mean they're going to be able to.
[01:39:31.928 --> 01:39:39.674]  And they're putting us in pain to drive us into breaking down and accepting a world social credit score and universal basic income where they have complete control.
[01:39:41.064 --> 01:39:47.587]  And I hear a lot of people on here talking about how, you know, they've started gardening, or their neighbor has gardened, or they're planning a garden, and that is great.
[01:39:47.947 --> 01:40:00.913]  But it's starting to become later in the season, and one of the things you can do, let's say you don't have a lot of property, or you don't have a yard, or you live in a populated area, buy a little bit more food every time you go to the grocery store.
[01:40:00.933 --> 01:40:03.474]  And I'm not talking big stuff, I'm talking canned beans.
[01:40:03.514 --> 01:40:07.176]  That's right, because it only shuts stuff down for a few months to make the average person break down.
[01:40:07.556 --> 01:40:09.737]  You've just got to be less weak than the last person.
[01:40:11.129 --> 01:40:13.212]  And don't forget about preparewithalex.com.
[01:40:13.372 --> 01:40:19.461]  My Patriot Supply, those are good as well, but if you don't have that much money, at least do something.
[01:40:19.481 --> 01:40:31.654]   And the next thing that I want people to do is once you've got, once you have admitted the problem, once you know what you're facing and you're no longer afraid, When you're becoming part of the solution, you need to build a community.
[01:40:32.054 --> 01:40:32.935]  You need to build a network.
[01:40:32.955 --> 01:40:33.255]  That's right.
[01:40:33.275 --> 01:40:38.839]  More important than water filtration and guns and food is a relationship with God and then a community.
[01:40:38.859 --> 01:40:42.262]  Because together we are so powerful together on a mission.
[01:40:42.702 --> 01:40:43.803]  Humans are incredible.
[01:40:43.863 --> 01:40:44.744]  Thank you so much, Luke.

[01:41:08.299 --> 01:41:11.420]  It is so important to be self-sufficient.
[01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:12.801]  Preparetoday.com.
[01:41:13.201 --> 01:41:16.448]   We also have The July 4th special.

[01:41:19.230 --> 01:41:22.953]  At 75% off, we're losing money on some of these products.

[01:41:39.747 --> 01:41:41.169]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:41:42.327 --> 01:41:42.527]  Or 888-253-3139.
[01:41:42.587 --> 01:41:44.248]  All right.
[01:41:44.868 --> 01:41:46.509]  I'm doing okay taking calls.
[01:41:47.049 --> 01:41:48.469]  But next segment's nine minutes long.
[01:41:48.589 --> 01:41:51.671]  I'm taking four calls when we come out of this break.
[01:41:51.731 --> 01:41:53.231]  So get ready.
[01:41:53.851 --> 01:41:54.492]  Get ready.
[01:41:55.352 --> 01:41:56.873]  You know, it's not a claim.
[01:41:58.393 --> 01:41:59.193]  It's not a boast.
[01:42:00.174 --> 01:42:00.974]  It's more of a burden.
[01:42:03.155 --> 01:42:04.275]  But you can't lie about it.
[01:42:05.756 --> 01:42:07.457]  We really are changing the world together.
[01:42:08.637 --> 01:42:10.578]  We really are laying out how things actually work.
[01:42:11.886 --> 01:42:18.507]  And if the public ever gets wind of it, and ever tunes in, which is happening, it's game over for the New World Order.
[01:42:20.608 --> 01:42:21.668]  And that's why they're so scared.
[01:42:21.708 --> 01:42:23.608]  Thank you so much for joining the Alex Jones Show.
[01:42:24.348 --> 01:42:28.669]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, here on this Friday Worldwide Broadcast.
[01:42:29.369 --> 01:42:32.130]  Let's go to the callers back in the order they are received.
[01:42:34.010 --> 01:42:37.111]  Let's go to Robert in Kentucky, then CJ in Ohio.
[01:42:37.551 --> 01:42:38.591]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:42:39.952 --> 01:42:40.412]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:40.532 --> 01:42:42.413]  Thank you so much, Alex Jones, for all you do.
[01:42:42.433 --> 01:42:42.853]  Thank you.
[01:42:42.933 --> 01:42:44.634]  I'm a long-time listener.
[01:42:44.794 --> 01:42:46.255]  Now I've listened for over 10 years.
[01:42:46.415 --> 01:42:47.595]  It's the first time I've called.
[01:42:48.216 --> 01:42:49.676]  Just wanted to get a quick thing out.
[01:42:50.396 --> 01:42:51.397]  I'm in my late 30s.
[01:42:52.117 --> 01:42:53.338]  I'm a healthy individual.
[01:42:53.558 --> 01:42:54.638]  I'm a construction worker.
[01:42:55.239 --> 01:43:05.463]  I had to have a surgery last year, and the hospital where I was going to get my surgery done said that I had to get both the COVID vaccines to be able to have my surgery.
[01:43:06.508 --> 01:43:13.571]  Um, about six months after my vaccinations and my surgery, I started having lots of fainting spells and blood pressure issues.
[01:43:14.332 --> 01:43:20.755]  And after lots of tests and, uh, you know, blood, blood work and stuff that I got done, I was diagnosed with POTS disease.
[01:43:21.215 --> 01:43:26.117]  And, uh, that is, uh, stands for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome.
[01:43:27.038 --> 01:43:37.631]   Um, I guess, uh, my question would be, and just a few months ago, I actually Well, I guess my question is, why are we being forced to have the vaccines?
[01:43:38.191 --> 01:43:42.374]  And if I can still catch COVID, what is the COVID vaccine doing for us?
[01:43:42.974 --> 01:43:52.159]  Well, it terrorized you and bullied you for the right to work into taking something that... I'm not a doctor, but what you described, was that a heart problem?
[01:43:52.519 --> 01:43:53.760]  A cardiovascular issue?
[01:43:54.540 --> 01:43:54.900]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:55.701]  It's a heart problem.
[01:43:55.761 --> 01:43:59.883]  And it caused when I stand up or start to walk after sitting down, I feel like I'm going to faint.
[01:44:01.810 --> 01:44:09.058]  I mean, sir, have you seen the October 2020 document from the CDC where they said exactly that would happen if you took the shot?
[01:44:09.458 --> 01:44:16.585]  They knew, they did it to you, and they have these useful idiots telling you to have a job, you gotta do it, and it's literally eugenics.
[01:44:16.646 --> 01:44:17.967]  They give you a soft kill weapon.
[01:44:18.447 --> 01:44:19.569]  There's ways to mitigate it.
[01:44:20.431 --> 01:44:23.431]   I've talked to a bunch of medical doctors on air and off air.
[01:44:23.431 --> 01:44:27.711]  It's growing prion crystals in your body causing blood clots.
[01:44:27.711 --> 01:44:33.551]   Ivermectin not just when you have it, but cycles of ivermectin now every couple of months
[01:44:33.551 --> 01:44:36.030]  is what people are doing to detoxify from it.
[01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:40.192]   I personally did another cycle of ivermectin, had my dad do it a few months ago and it really
[01:44:40.192 --> 01:44:41.192]  helped us.
[01:44:41.192 --> 01:44:48.831]  This is a very serious chronic infection nanotech bioweapon.
[01:44:48.831 --> 01:44:54.072]   But ivermectin kills parasites and it's a parasite so God bless you.
[01:44:54.087 --> 01:44:55.288]  I'm sorry that happened to you, Robert.
[01:44:55.928 --> 01:44:57.288]  Yeah, these people are unbelievable.
[01:44:57.869 --> 01:45:00.529]  But they have idiots that don't know what they're doing making you do it.
[01:45:02.530 --> 01:45:04.711]  I've talked to a lot of doctors and nurses on-air and off-air.
[01:45:04.731 --> 01:45:09.512]  Where you wonder why there's hospital staffing shortages now.
[01:45:09.552 --> 01:45:10.613]  There weren't two years ago.
[01:45:11.253 --> 01:45:14.794]  Their excuse was take the shot, lock down, because of hospital shortages.
[01:45:15.314 --> 01:45:17.135]  Now there's shortages because the people are so sick.
[01:45:19.423 --> 01:45:21.824]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Junior.
[01:45:21.844 --> 01:45:23.886]  No, no, CJ's next.
[01:45:24.626 --> 01:45:25.166]  And then Junior.
[01:45:25.547 --> 01:45:26.867]  CJ in Ohio.
[01:45:26.947 --> 01:45:27.268]  Welcome.
[01:45:27.288 --> 01:45:27.868]  Thanks for holding.
[01:45:29.649 --> 01:45:30.189]  Thanks, Alec.
[01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:33.311]  What's on your mind, CJ?
[01:45:33.331 --> 01:45:36.893]  Yeah, I wanted to thank you for honoring Dr. Blanco today.
[01:45:36.913 --> 01:45:38.774]  I think that's a great thing to do.
[01:45:38.814 --> 01:45:56.823]   You know, I'm calling in to give him my blessings and his family and be thinking about him and praying for them over the Over the coming days, in the midst of the confusion, and all the BS of the COVID, all the data manipulation stuff, I mean, he was a real lighted path for many of us, and hopefully for many others.
[01:45:57.964 --> 01:46:04.451]  Well, he was exactly where he wanted to be, and he did a great job, so we all are very proud of him, including his family right now.
[01:46:05.312 --> 01:46:07.294]  That's a life well-led against the enemy.
[01:46:08.427 --> 01:46:08.587]  Yep.
[01:46:08.947 --> 01:46:12.008]  He was a sturdy stolen thinker and a lovable teddy bear all in one.
[01:46:12.368 --> 01:46:15.568]  And we should continue to support his Z-Stack formulation, too.
[01:46:15.588 --> 01:46:16.429]  It makes a lot of sense.
[01:46:16.469 --> 01:46:20.009]  He did a great job explaining why it worked and all the research he did on it.
[01:46:21.150 --> 01:46:24.990]  Also to help support his family, just like we support the InfoWars.
[01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.891]  Absolutely.
[01:46:26.851 --> 01:46:27.031]  Yep.
[01:46:27.211 --> 01:46:29.291]  We all need to find a hill to die on like he did.
[01:46:29.631 --> 01:46:31.512]  And, you know, it's all around us.
[01:46:31.592 --> 01:46:37.393]  I mean, if you watch what happened with the Tina Fears election the other day, I mean, it's a full scam.
[01:46:38.484 --> 01:46:41.166]  Full steam ahead.
[01:46:41.306 --> 01:46:44.769]  He loved everybody, but he was Jewish and proud of his faith, which is great.
[01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:46.411]  That's Masada.
[01:46:46.431 --> 01:46:48.973]  Where does a hill to die on come from?
[01:46:48.993 --> 01:46:54.277]  It comes from Masada, with the Romans and the Jews all dying on the hill.
[01:46:54.357 --> 01:46:56.259]  We are all at our Masada right now.
[01:46:56.779 --> 01:46:57.840]  I appreciate your call, brother.
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:58.421]  God bless you.
[01:46:58.881 --> 01:47:00.182]  All right, let's jam in another call here.
[01:47:01.023 --> 01:47:03.785]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matt in Florida, then Junior.
[01:47:04.186 --> 01:47:05.707]  Matt in Florida, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:47:06.894 --> 01:47:10.635]  They say that you're a character, Alex, and you're a great guy, man.
[01:47:10.695 --> 01:47:12.955]  That Biden and Kamala are the real characters.
[01:47:12.995 --> 01:47:14.376]  You know, they're fake and they're actors.
[01:47:14.416 --> 01:47:15.476]  They're career politicians.
[01:47:15.536 --> 01:47:17.576]  They work their way into power, lying and cheating.
[01:47:17.616 --> 01:47:19.377]  So don't let them get to you.
[01:47:19.397 --> 01:47:20.497]  Let me tell you.
[01:47:20.997 --> 01:47:24.898]  Everything I say here, I mean life and death real on my soul.
[01:47:25.378 --> 01:47:26.639]  And that's why they say, oh, he's not real.
[01:47:26.659 --> 01:47:27.139]  He doesn't mean it.
[01:47:27.399 --> 01:47:29.899]  Well, why is all this fake stuff I claim keep coming true?
[01:47:29.979 --> 01:47:32.180]  No, I mean what I say 100 percent.
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:34.681]  You got that right, Alex.
[01:47:34.741 --> 01:47:43.065]  And you know, I speak about you positively in my book, InfoWars, I mean, COVID-42, which is getting crushed by the cancel culture, I think.
[01:47:43.145 --> 01:47:46.407]  I got a publishing deal on it, but we just can't get it out there regardless.
[01:47:46.487 --> 01:47:48.728]  Send me a copy, Matt.
[01:47:48.768 --> 01:47:49.469]  We love you, brother.
[01:47:49.509 --> 01:47:50.369]  We appreciate you.
[01:47:50.789 --> 01:47:52.030]  Let's put in another caller here.
[01:47:52.090 --> 01:47:53.070]  Let's talk to Junior.
[01:47:55.572 --> 01:47:56.432]  Junior in Texas.
[01:47:56.452 --> 01:47:57.193]  You're on the air, Junior.
[01:47:57.233 --> 01:47:57.473]  Go ahead.
[01:47:58.615 --> 01:47:59.736]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[01:47:59.756 --> 01:48:04.338]  I just want to say, starting by saying I commend you and I believe all the hard work that you continue to be doing.
[01:48:04.898 --> 01:48:07.459]  With that being said, Dr. Zelenko did not die in vain.
[01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:10.420]  He brought us a lot of wisdom.
[01:48:11.121 --> 01:48:11.621]  Let me stop you.
[01:48:11.641 --> 01:48:12.581]  Your phone's a little muffled.
[01:48:12.621 --> 01:48:13.642]  Talk right in your receiver.
[01:48:14.942 --> 01:48:15.863]  Can you hear me?
[01:48:16.103 --> 01:48:17.204]  Now I hear you loud and clear.
[01:48:17.244 --> 01:48:17.964]  Go ahead, Junior.
[01:48:18.484 --> 01:48:18.864]  Awesome.
[01:48:18.984 --> 01:48:24.607]  I just wanted to say I commend you for your hard work and that you continue to keep doing and Dr. Zelenko did not die in vain.
[01:48:25.881 --> 01:48:31.803]  His beacon of wisdom that he shared with us will be forever cherished, and I can attest to this as a science major.
[01:48:32.243 --> 01:48:40.725]  With that being said, have you heard about the new drops that Greg Phillips from 2,000 Mews is about to release?
[01:48:41.105 --> 01:48:44.346]  It's going to literally make the 2,000 Mews look like we're walking a park.
[01:48:44.486 --> 01:48:46.307]  I have heard about it.
[01:48:46.407 --> 01:48:48.547]  I want to get the folks from 2,000 Mews back on.
[01:48:49.048 --> 01:48:50.548]  Tell listeners the new developments.
[01:48:51.840 --> 01:48:55.762]  Yes, this upcoming July literally is going to be crazy.
[01:48:56.062 --> 01:48:57.022]  It's going to be fireworks.
[01:48:57.562 --> 01:49:03.345]  God is getting ready to intervene and deliver this nation and teach us a lesson, okay?
[01:49:03.865 --> 01:49:07.507]  With that being said, it's going to be crazy.
[01:49:07.587 --> 01:49:12.229]  I heard they're about to release more info, so what are they about to release, Gib?
[01:49:12.249 --> 01:49:13.649]  Because I'm definitely going to look it up.
[01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.969]  Tell me.
[01:49:15.450 --> 01:49:20.332]  It's going to have to deal with the election fraud of 2020 and foreign interference, right?
[01:49:20.631 --> 01:49:23.691]   meaning this was an act of war and a national security have been
[01:49:23.691 --> 01:49:25.110]  breached and compromised.
[01:49:25.110 --> 01:49:29.550]   So it's going to divide this nation probably much more than it already
[01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:30.050]  is.
[01:49:30.050 --> 01:49:34.131]   And I'm just grateful that I'm alive to witness this stuff
[01:49:34.131 --> 01:49:38.170]   because I've been recording and keeping archives of all this
[01:49:38.170 --> 01:49:41.091]   following the election fraud since 2020.
[01:49:41.091 --> 01:49:44.650]   And this lady by the name of Maria Zak, I will really suggest
[01:49:44.650 --> 01:49:47.051]  you bring her on your show.
[01:49:47.051 --> 01:49:50.771]   She's from Nations in Action, a nonprofit organization.
[01:49:50.771 --> 01:49:52.010]  Well, get her on, get her on.
[01:49:52.010 --> 01:49:55.331]   I totally agree with you, Junior, that who could be bored during
[01:49:56.062 --> 01:49:57.423]  I mean, this is not a movie.
[01:49:57.743 --> 01:49:59.465]  This is not a football game that doesn't matter.
[01:49:59.505 --> 01:50:02.128]  This is the real world battle for the future.
[01:50:02.228 --> 01:50:02.528]  Wow.
[01:50:03.129 --> 01:50:04.069]  Thank you so much, Junior.
[01:50:05.217 --> 01:50:08.179]  All right, Joe, Anderson, Andrew, Abraham.
[01:50:08.219 --> 01:50:09.800]  We're going to order the calls we received.
[01:50:10.180 --> 01:50:15.903]  So Abraham is up next on the other side, then the Dr. Zelenko compilation we have, and more.
[01:50:17.384 --> 01:50:19.145]  Wow, absolutely insane.
[01:50:19.285 --> 01:50:20.566]  What a time to be alive.
[01:50:20.626 --> 01:50:23.248]  I mean, no way to be bored right now.
[01:50:23.748 --> 01:50:24.809]  People say they're bored.
[01:50:25.449 --> 01:50:27.330]  That's because they're watching too much Netflix, baby.
[01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:29.311]  I ain't living in Netflix world.
[01:50:29.391 --> 01:50:31.953]  I'm living in the info war, and it's real.
[01:50:32.233 --> 01:50:32.953]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:32.994 --> 01:50:33.454]  Stay with us.
[01:50:35.083 --> 01:50:38.766]  The Obama administration, that's what is in charge of the U.S.
[01:50:38.806 --> 01:50:48.452]  right now, went on Fox News and said, it's Trump's fault 53 people died in a tractor trailer this week in South Texas.
[01:50:49.333 --> 01:50:51.955]  That clip's coming up in the first segment of the next hour.
[01:50:54.733 --> 01:50:55.633]  I love you Alex.
[01:50:55.693 --> 01:50:57.033]  You're doing great work.
[01:50:57.053 --> 01:50:57.954]  Dr. Zelenko did great work.
[01:50:57.774 --> 01:50:59.414]  out of the Bandai video.
[01:50:59.414 --> 01:51:05.414]   And I have a Dr. Zelenko compilation eclipse in his last interview with us, parts of it next segment.
[01:51:05.414 --> 01:51:07.734]  But right now we're taking your phone calls.
[01:51:07.734 --> 01:51:11.253]  And so let's go in the order they are received.
[01:51:11.253 --> 01:51:13.774]  Abraham in New York, thanks for calling.
[01:51:13.774 --> 01:51:15.774]  Let's talk about Dr. Zelenko, go ahead.
[01:51:15.774 --> 01:51:19.014]  I love you Alex, you're doing great work.
[01:51:19.014 --> 01:51:21.293]  Dr. Zelenko did great work.
[01:51:21.293 --> 01:51:23.293]  We cannot forget about him.
[01:51:23.293 --> 01:51:28.734]   I'm gonna make two very sound suggestions as to what the Infowar family should consider.
[01:51:28.688 --> 01:51:51.393]   We need to create a corporation that runs parallel with InfoWars and everybody can pay a monthly Do whatever you're able to, and maybe every 60 days we have a vote on how those monies will be invested, whether it's for Owen's legal defense, whether it's to expand bandwidth, whether it's to give out free DVDs on the street to people.
[01:51:52.053 --> 01:51:53.554]  Whatever we have to do, we have to do it.
[01:51:54.194 --> 01:52:01.974]   but that would be one part and it would be an InfoWars family-based apparatus
[01:52:01.974 --> 01:52:07.873]   that helps to command the monetized resources that we need to protect Owen and to protect Hamilton
[01:52:07.873 --> 01:52:09.394]  and to protect Alex.
[01:52:09.394 --> 01:52:13.795]   And we could use those monies for other things as new problems emerge.
[01:52:13.795 --> 01:52:20.873]   Second, we need from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m., we need to keep rerunning all of the great work,
[01:52:20.873 --> 01:52:27.394]   Malcolm X, Dr. Zelenko, all of the classic material that brought us--
[01:52:27.394 --> 01:52:29.394]  By the way, I totally agree with you.
[01:52:28.810 --> 01:52:30.451]  I agree with everything Malcolm X said.
[01:52:30.951 --> 01:52:35.232]  Like you tune into Malcolm X interviews, which they suppress, every bit of it's true.
[01:52:35.272 --> 01:52:38.713]  Today, it's just as important or more important than when he said it.
[01:52:40.814 --> 01:52:41.434]  Absolutely.
[01:52:41.914 --> 01:52:47.216]  And Dr. Valenko, every single day of our lives, we need to hear words from him.
[01:52:47.676 --> 01:52:48.716]  He was courageous.
[01:52:49.036 --> 01:52:50.417]  He could have lived a comfortable life.
[01:52:51.775 --> 01:52:52.475]  Well, that's it, Abraham.
[01:52:52.515 --> 01:52:56.456]  If there weren't other men and women that had courage, we would be totally screwed.
[01:52:56.296 --> 01:52:58.416]  put himself out there more for us.
[01:52:58.416 --> 01:53:03.896]   It is our duty to salute him and all the others that were brave enough, that were endowed by God
[01:53:03.896 --> 01:53:07.655]  with wisdom, with courage, like Owen, like Hamilton.
[01:53:07.655 --> 01:53:08.655]  Well that's it, Abraham.
[01:53:08.655 --> 01:53:12.296]   If there weren't other men and women that had courage, we would be totally screwed.
[01:53:12.296 --> 01:53:17.456]   As bad as things are, we are living off the gas these men and women put in the tank.
[01:53:17.456 --> 01:53:22.775]   And let me tell you, my mother, she was in the classroom in Columbia University
[01:53:22.775 --> 01:53:31.015]   under Pitman Zabinsky, and about 15 years later, then after that, because she was computer literate in 1980,
[01:53:31.015 --> 01:53:36.216]   she was working right next to David Rockefeller, helping him to do his computer setup.
[01:53:36.528 --> 01:53:39.189]  And when I ask him about these people, they're nerds.
[01:53:39.429 --> 01:53:46.512]  These are calm persons that when you are next to them, they don't seem to have any evil agenda or any power.
[01:53:46.552 --> 01:53:52.535]  Just like Jeffrey Dahmer or just like all the famous serial killers, they look non-threatening, but they're dangerous as hell.
[01:53:53.796 --> 01:53:54.376]  Absolutely.
[01:53:54.796 --> 01:53:56.857]  And these two ideas that I'm saying are very important.
[01:53:57.572 --> 01:54:03.971]   an InfoWars-like union, just an InfoWars union, the Alex Jones accounting firm,
[01:54:03.971 --> 01:54:09.032]   those guys could be the overseers of this to make sure we manage it correctly.
[01:54:09.032 --> 01:54:16.610]   And from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m., we rerun seven days a week all of the great orators,
[01:54:16.610 --> 01:54:21.291]   whether it's Bill Cooper, Malcolm X, even Dr. King, and all the classic content,
[01:54:21.291 --> 01:54:25.212]   and let the people from time to time vote on what we need to reinforce.
[01:54:25.212 --> 01:54:30.610]   But we have to let the great wise men of the past have their words be thoroughly preserved.
[01:54:30.565 --> 01:54:34.325]   No, you're totally right. That's how they win is demonizing great leaders,
[01:54:34.325 --> 01:54:39.924]   misrepresenting what they said and then suppressing. Take Eisenhower, his 21-minute speech
[01:54:39.924 --> 01:54:44.725]   was not just military-industrial complex. He said there's a scientific elite that's evil
[01:54:44.725 --> 01:54:49.365]   that is in control and taking over. Where is that speech? I mean, I agree. Famous speeches
[01:54:49.365 --> 01:54:52.885]   from the past. Those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it. Beautiful, Abraham.
[01:54:52.885 --> 01:54:56.165]  Thank you so much. Another powerful caller.
[01:54:56.387 --> 01:54:58.689]  Let's go ahead and talk to Anderson in Maryland.
[01:54:58.749 --> 01:54:59.670]  Anderson, thanks for calling.
[01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:00.591]  Alex.
[01:55:01.872 --> 01:55:02.172]  Welcome.
[01:55:03.393 --> 01:55:03.773]  Thank you.
[01:55:04.113 --> 01:55:05.114]  Thank you very much.
[01:55:05.735 --> 01:55:08.457]  Hey, look, RIP Dr. Jeff.
[01:55:09.258 --> 01:55:10.078]  Love what you're doing.
[01:55:10.458 --> 01:55:11.239]  Love your product.
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:13.441]  Watch all three shows.
[01:55:14.722 --> 01:55:19.546]  Hey, look, what's on my mind is I can't believe this hasn't exploded.
[01:55:20.447 --> 01:55:36.291]   But May 20th, 2022, Navy Lieutenant Bill Moseley went before the Administrative Board and he was cleared 3-0 unanimously of misconduct for not taking the shot.
[01:55:36.851 --> 01:55:37.391]  I saw that.
[01:55:37.431 --> 01:55:37.991]  No, you're right.
[01:55:38.371 --> 01:55:40.952]  The fact is they can't make you take an experimental shot.
[01:55:41.272 --> 01:55:42.052]  It's all a hoax.
[01:55:43.013 --> 01:55:52.315]  Well, they, I assume the government, was not able to provide the FDA-approved vaccine, so-called vaccine.
[01:55:53.294 --> 01:55:54.836]  But they weren't able to provide that.
[01:55:55.236 --> 01:56:06.567]  That's right, under federal law, and under the anthrax ruling, you cannot give somebody an experimental shot, doesn't matter if they're military, doesn't matter if they're a black person, a white person, you can't Tuskegee people anymore in this country.
[01:56:07.688 --> 01:56:11.532]  Yeah, well, hey, look, I was terminated for not taking it.
[01:56:11.552 --> 01:56:12.633]  They don't own my body.
[01:56:13.333 --> 01:56:17.878]  You know, I have my two feet on the ground, and I plant them firmly.
[01:56:18.823 --> 01:56:21.905]  But doesn't this help the people that have lost their careers?
[01:56:21.925 --> 01:56:22.025]  Yeah.
[01:56:21.845 --> 01:56:25.045]   You're right, we should make a lot bigger deal about it brother, we forget this.
[01:56:25.045 --> 01:56:28.885]  And I'm sorry that you lost your...
[01:56:28.885 --> 01:56:35.684]   They planned it as a culling and as a litmus test to get rid of the good people.
[01:56:35.684 --> 01:56:43.925]   Yeah, I mean, I completed a third of my career and they just let me go because they think
[01:56:44.201 --> 01:56:48.840]   Well, Anderson, I'm sorry that happened to you, but you did the right thing. God's looking. At least you're not having
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:51.201]   a heart attack and dying right now. God bless you and I love you.
[01:56:51.201 --> 01:56:56.270]   Oh, Jammin', everybody in here, we're gonna talk to these callers for hours. We gotta get to everybody. Joe in New
[01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:58.201]  Jersey, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:56:58.201 --> 01:57:00.201]  Hey, Alex. How you doing?
[01:57:00.201 --> 01:57:03.201]  Man, I'm just blown away. It's up so crazy now.
[01:57:03.201 --> 01:57:06.201]  Yeah, you know what? I want to give you a thank you.
[01:57:06.201 --> 01:57:14.201]   Every other one of these news outlets, politicians, I mean, they touted this Vax forever.
[01:57:13.010 --> 01:57:14.170]  Families got torn apart.
[01:57:14.210 --> 01:57:14.910]  People got hurt.
[01:57:15.371 --> 01:57:16.651]  You deserve a thank you.
[01:57:17.411 --> 01:57:20.012]  Well, I'm doing it for everybody, brother.
[01:57:20.212 --> 01:57:21.773]  Thank you.
[01:57:21.873 --> 01:57:24.614]  I've got kid number two on the way.
[01:57:26.074 --> 01:57:33.917]  I thank God every day that my wife, me, my current kid, and the unborn child right now, we're all safe, not vaxed.
[01:57:34.881 --> 01:57:40.964]  Thanks to Alpha Power, it only took me about a month to make the second one, so I don't know if that's bad for me, but good for you guys.
[01:57:40.984 --> 01:57:47.227]  I mean, Alpha Power is definitely a libido male enhancer.
[01:57:47.247 --> 01:57:49.088]  It's good for women too, but it's definitely powerful.
[01:57:49.888 --> 01:57:51.109]  It's unbelievable, unbelievable.
[01:57:51.209 --> 01:57:52.770]  Also, I want to bring up a second point.
[01:57:52.790 --> 01:58:03.975]  You know, you look at people like Hannity, and they always go so soft with, you know, they say, oh look, stupid Biden, he's getting rid of the gasoline and blah, blah, blah.
[01:58:04.656 --> 01:58:08.137]  They don't even see the quote where they're literally saying, liberal new world order.
[01:58:08.157 --> 01:58:09.238]  When are people going to wake up?
[01:58:09.718 --> 01:58:10.619]  I mean, pretty soon.
[01:58:11.199 --> 01:58:15.100]  Even these rhinos, they're going to be complicit in the loss of America, if you ask me.
[01:58:15.481 --> 01:58:15.921]  No, I agree.
[01:58:15.961 --> 01:58:18.642]  I think they're already complicit, Andrew, and I appreciate your call.
[01:58:19.262 --> 01:58:20.283]  All right, here's what I'm going to do.
[01:58:21.283 --> 01:58:24.804]  Got other great guest hosts coming up, but I asked what I'd do this morning to put together.
[01:58:24.884 --> 01:58:25.565]  He put it together.
[01:58:26.305 --> 01:58:29.566]  Some stations don't carry it, but we'll post it for those who don't see it at Bandaw Video.
[01:58:30.067 --> 01:58:32.508]  I saw this clip of a Democrat operative on Fox.
[01:58:33.616 --> 01:58:46.920]  And he's saying, you'll see the clip in a minute, oh we're controlling the borders, Trump made it fail, the border's not failed, and finally both the host and the guests, the other guests, say you're full of crap and they don't even respond to it.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:55.022]  They're like, you're a liar, you know it's a lie, and instead of debating the fraud they just say you're a liar.
[01:58:57.028 --> 01:59:00.871]  And that's the point we've got to get to where we just say, you are a liar.
[01:59:00.911 --> 01:59:01.431]  You're lying.
[01:59:01.451 --> 01:59:02.171]  We're calling you out.
[01:59:02.452 --> 01:59:04.093]  We're not debating all your fake points.
[01:59:04.153 --> 01:59:04.993]  We know you're a liar.
[01:59:05.614 --> 01:59:14.560]  So that clip's coming up and then I'll go a little bit in the second segment before we hand the baton to, I forget who the guest host is today in the fourth hour, the great Jay Dyer.
[01:59:15.762 --> 01:59:17.463]  So I'll host about 10 minutes in the next hour.
[01:59:17.483 --> 01:59:19.345]  I've got some other news I want to hit as well.
[01:59:19.885 --> 01:59:28.511]  And then we will hand the baton to Jay Dyer and Owen Schroer, coming up in about an hour and 15 minutes with The War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:59:28.571 --> 01:59:28.891]  Central.
[01:59:28.951 --> 01:59:36.477]  And then, did it last Saturday, made national news, great job Savannah Hernandez and Drew Hernandez.
[01:59:37.947 --> 01:59:44.236]  We are going to do another special live show Saturday, tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[01:59:44.296 --> 01:59:45.718]  at least until 1 p.m.
[01:59:46.259 --> 01:59:47.440]  only on the streams.
[01:59:48.895 --> 02:00:01.665]  It isn't about us being right, but I think it's key to really have people face what we're up against if we have any chance of beating them.
[02:00:01.685 --> 02:00:03.546]  It's like someone who plays chess.
[02:00:04.026 --> 02:00:07.389]  The better chess player you are, the more moves ahead you could see.
[02:00:07.889 --> 02:00:09.831]  And I see already that it's checkmate.
[02:00:10.411 --> 02:00:18.077]  The only question that's still a variable is how much carnage and what will be the body count of the innocent until we get to that point.
[02:00:18.752 --> 02:00:30.317]  And the reason why I'm doing these interviews is that I hope that spreading the true narrative and giving people hope may mitigate or reduce the body count.
[02:00:30.337 --> 02:00:42.822]   30 years ago, it became obvious to the people In power and people who are the wealthiest, most powerful people on the planet, that there was going to be a major catastrophe economically in 30 years.
[02:00:43.342 --> 02:00:51.225]  There would be a collapse, bankruptcy of the beginning, a bankruptcy of Social Security and Medicare.
[02:00:51.687 --> 02:00:52.707]  And that's all known.
[02:00:53.328 --> 02:01:00.390]  And Biden's recent policies of increased entitlements have upped the date to the anticipated collapse to 2027-2026.
[02:01:00.691 --> 02:01:02.011]  It used to be 2028.
[02:01:02.071 --> 02:01:05.532]  That's the beginning.
[02:01:05.572 --> 02:01:08.994]  And within 10 years, there'll be a complete bankruptcy.
[02:01:09.394 --> 02:01:19.678]  That will have a tsunami effect on the global economy and threatens the stakeholders, their power and their wealth.
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:27.502]  Uh, and control mechanisms over humanity, which they've had cultivated over millennia.
[02:01:27.742 --> 02:01:41.847]  When the system collapses, the and the dust settles, they will have the new financial infrastructure and control mechanisms to lead to the ultimate enslavement of humanity.
[02:01:42.027 --> 02:01:42.808]  And let me explain.
[02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:51.346]   Um, in 2016, everyone knows Klaus Schwab said that within 10 years, meaning by 2026.
[02:01:53.087 --> 02:02:01.333]  Right before the anticipated collapse, 7 billion people will be tagged with a digital tracking device, essentially.
[02:02:02.314 --> 02:02:11.440]  A biometric sensor that transmits biometric data with your location to a third party.
[02:02:11.741 --> 02:02:33.710]   The patent that I mentioned earlier gives the technology and the mechanism through which Klaus Schwab's prophecy Let's say about 7 billion people having a digital identifier that connects them to a centralized network or grid or matrix is going to happen.
[02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:39.113]  And the second patent that goes together with that is what Microsoft has from 2020.
[02:02:40.534 --> 02:02:42.455]  It's W.O.
[02:02:42.475 --> 02:02:42.915]  2020-06-06-06.
[02:02:43.315 --> 02:02:49.018]  And that patent describes the linkage of biometric data transmission to cryptocurrency.
[02:02:49.511 --> 02:02:51.372]  And so let me explain to you what that actually means.
[02:02:52.153 --> 02:03:02.499]  It means that in the future, say 2026 at the time, there'll be no more EasyPass, there'll be no more Apple Pay, there'll be no more credit cards.
[02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:06.722]  It'll be biometric transactions.
[02:03:06.822 --> 02:03:15.127]  In other words, you are now injected with a technology that transmits your internal temperament and your internal data.
[02:03:15.780 --> 02:03:17.521]  With your location to a third party.
[02:03:17.581 --> 02:03:23.745]  Now, and that will allow you to, let's say, put your hand on a scanner and then walk out from the supermarket.
[02:03:24.125 --> 02:03:29.788]  So the hipsters think it's cool, but the problem with that is, what if I don't want to be part of the matrix?
[02:03:30.068 --> 02:03:34.891]  What if I don't want to be injected with a tracking technology?
[02:03:35.391 --> 02:03:37.752]  Well, then I would be excluded from the system of finance.
[02:03:38.213 --> 02:03:43.796]  I won't be able to buy bread, at least not probably on the black market, but I won't be able to buy bread for my family.
[02:03:44.344 --> 02:03:45.385]  So it's a control mechanism.
[02:03:45.425 --> 02:03:46.306]  It's the mark of the beast.
[02:03:46.466 --> 02:03:56.915]  We're talking about a force of evil that has always used human slavery as an asset.
[02:03:56.935 --> 02:04:04.383]   Slavery has always been The most lucrative industry in the history of humanity.
[02:04:04.863 --> 02:04:06.364]  And these people are amoral.
[02:04:06.684 --> 02:04:07.504]  They're not immoral.
[02:04:07.584 --> 02:04:08.805]  They are amoral.
[02:04:09.285 --> 02:04:12.407]  Which means they are moral when it's expedient for them.
[02:04:12.848 --> 02:04:15.009]  They're immoral when it's expedient for them.
[02:04:15.529 --> 02:04:17.930]  They support the Jews when it's expedient for them.
[02:04:18.331 --> 02:04:20.512]  They support the Christians when it's useful to them.
[02:04:20.932 --> 02:04:24.734]  And then they set the Jews against the Christians and vice versa when it's useful for them.
[02:04:24.794 --> 02:04:26.736]  They're capitalists when they need to be.
[02:04:26.776 --> 02:04:28.797]  They're communists when they need to be.
[02:04:28.817 --> 02:04:43.481]   This level of malevolence Transcends all of these systems that they have set and they play games and create chaos and geopolitical destabilization in order to promote their own agenda.
[02:04:43.781 --> 02:04:50.525]  In this particular case, it became obvious to everyone that there was going to be a huge economic collapse and they were threatened.
[02:04:51.146 --> 02:04:51.866]  What have they done?
[02:04:52.767 --> 02:05:04.645]   They've initiated a plan over the last 30 years that will result in when the system collapses, The and the dust settles they will have
[02:05:05.276 --> 02:05:12.097]  The new financial infrastructure and control mechanisms to lead to the ultimate enslavement of humanity.
[02:05:12.497 --> 02:05:16.718]  But the reality is that COVID-19 is a weapon of mass destruction.
[02:05:16.758 --> 02:05:17.798]  It was made in a laboratory.
[02:05:17.858 --> 02:05:18.618]  No one denies that.
[02:05:19.059 --> 02:05:24.780]  Ralph Baric in 1999 did research at the University of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:32.501]  He was able to manipulate a bat animal virus, a bat coronavirus, converted by modulating a surface protein.
[02:05:33.121 --> 02:05:34.261]  To infect human beings.
[02:05:34.441 --> 02:05:35.522]  But it was still benign.
[02:05:36.102 --> 02:05:37.502]  It was just infecting human beings, now.
[02:05:38.262 --> 02:05:56.366]  And then, in 2010, the same Ralph Baric figured out a way to diffuse coronaviruses by using zinc and zinc-ion, of course, inhibiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or inhibiting a coronavirus replication.
[02:05:56.486 --> 02:06:02.726]   In 2015, and by the way, everything's here being funded by the United States government, So, because it's on the papers.
[02:06:03.227 --> 02:06:09.373]  And on the peer-reviewed papers, they thank the United States government, NIH or whatever, for the funding.
[02:06:09.393 --> 02:06:26.489]   Then, in 2015, in Wuhan, Eric, together in collaboration with Zhengli, Dr. Zhengli, the bad lady they call her, were able to figure out a way to augment the payload of this weapon To destroy human lung tissue and cause blood clots.
[02:06:27.109 --> 02:06:28.931]  They wrote a paper about it.
[02:06:28.991 --> 02:06:30.392]  They thanked the NIH.
[02:06:30.773 --> 02:06:32.975]  They published it and they got patents on it.
[02:06:33.815 --> 02:06:35.397]  And here's another layer to the story.
[02:06:35.457 --> 02:06:40.621]  The same Ralph Baric worked with the team from Gilead Pharmaceuticals to make remdesivir.
[02:06:41.342 --> 02:06:43.844]  So every way you can see the criminal pre-planning.
[02:06:44.445 --> 02:06:48.388]  And they suppressed the antidote intentionally, not for themselves.
[02:06:48.428 --> 02:06:53.024]   You think these These masterminds want their own families to die?
[02:06:53.044 --> 02:06:53.824]  Of course not.
[02:06:54.244 --> 02:06:55.065]  They themselves know.
[02:06:55.085 --> 02:07:12.294]  This is consistent with what I knew about the executives of... Yeah, you broke that a year ago, and Joe Rogan confirmed it, that hundreds of members of Congress in Hollywood all know about this, but still want it suppressed, that your protocol, they were using your protocol, but they suppress it for the general public.
[02:07:12.574 --> 02:07:13.334]  Talk about evil.
[02:07:14.955 --> 02:07:39.862]   Yeah, also the executives of Google, I know, internally that they're all taking hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and so this was this information the antidote to the bomb the poison was known was created by the same the same monsters but they hid it from you and me now when doctors like myself stumbled across these approaches
[02:07:41.131 --> 02:07:42.552]  Because we had a necessity.
[02:07:42.572 --> 02:07:43.372]  The patients were dying.
[02:07:43.752 --> 02:07:44.813]  And so we needed some help.
[02:07:45.453 --> 02:07:46.133]  We needed help.
[02:07:46.614 --> 02:07:47.594]  We needed to treat the patients.
[02:07:48.074 --> 02:08:00.059]  And so, immediately, anything that would help, hydroxychloroquine, then ivermectin, and even the concept of early intervention, getting rid of this infection before the complications begin.
[02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:10.657]   Everything was vilified, marginalized, and I know folks, a lot of people have come and gone, but I always liked Zelenko.
[02:08:10.697 --> 02:08:11.418]  I really love him.
[02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:18.608]  And I just feel joyful that he's had this great life and been such a good man.
[02:08:18.628 --> 02:08:20.431]  I don't feel sad he's dead.
[02:08:22.762 --> 02:08:24.083]  Because I know he lives on with us.
[02:08:24.203 --> 02:08:25.603]  Just a good man.
[02:08:26.164 --> 02:08:28.065]  And up front fighting hard.
[02:08:28.685 --> 02:08:31.786]  And we look at Dr. Mercola and Dr. Moncala being attacked.
[02:08:32.307 --> 02:08:33.107]  And we're being attacked.
[02:08:33.147 --> 02:08:34.367]  That's where we're supposed to be.
[02:08:34.387 --> 02:08:35.228]  Dammit.
[02:08:35.728 --> 02:08:36.268]  We're men.
[02:08:37.049 --> 02:08:39.850]  And if we're fighting evil, we should expect to be attacked.
[02:08:39.890 --> 02:08:44.052]  People say, oh, I'm so sorry they're lying about you and doing all this to you.
[02:08:44.092 --> 02:08:45.473]  Look, I don't enjoy the attacks.
[02:08:46.173 --> 02:08:46.853]  I don't like them.
[02:08:46.913 --> 02:08:47.514]  But you know what?
[02:08:49.471 --> 02:08:52.774]  I mean, I decided to take these people on.
[02:08:53.435 --> 02:08:59.520]  And I can tell you this, just like Congress will commission an officer to be in the military, you have commissioned me.
[02:09:00.561 --> 02:09:04.104]  And I take that commission very, very seriously.
[02:09:05.005 --> 02:09:07.967]  My biggest problem is I get mad that I'm not doing enough.
[02:09:08.108 --> 02:09:13.225]   But I just want to say, all of this crew, This crew is amazing.
[02:09:13.286 --> 02:09:19.792]  I love them all, and I love our listeners, and I love our sponsors and affiliates, and I'm just so thankful to you all.
[02:09:19.832 --> 02:09:20.733]  Okay, here's what I'm going to do.
[02:09:21.473 --> 02:09:22.594]  I'm not going to cut into Jay Dyer.
[02:09:22.634 --> 02:09:24.116]  He's got too much to cover, too much to cover.
[02:09:24.836 --> 02:09:32.323]  If we can call Andrew back during the live show tomorrow at 11 a.m., when we take calls, we're going to have the phones up tomorrow on the live show and take calls again.
[02:09:33.825 --> 02:09:35.346]  It's a Saturday, uncensored show.
[02:09:36.403 --> 02:09:47.791]  And by that, I'm not hiding any information that I won't say on the main show, but we can't show you a live abortion rally, or we can't show you what happens at these pedophile parades on our affiliates.
[02:09:48.371 --> 02:09:50.273]  Because, quite frankly, it should be illegal.
[02:09:50.313 --> 02:09:50.953]  But they're doing it.
[02:09:51.233 --> 02:09:51.874]  We're going to show you.
[02:09:53.155 --> 02:09:54.836]  So, parental discretion advised.
[02:09:56.906 --> 02:09:58.647]  You know, I say I'm going to show it, I just can't make myself.
[02:09:58.928 --> 02:09:59.628]  I'll show some of it.
[02:09:59.969 --> 02:10:00.869]  The point is, 11 a.m.
[02:10:00.889 --> 02:10:01.790]  tomorrow, we're going live.
[02:10:02.271 --> 02:10:03.151]  Jay Dyer's coming up.
[02:10:03.592 --> 02:10:06.614]  Andrew will get your number from Portland for holding for an hour.
[02:10:06.654 --> 02:10:08.916]  If you want to call in tomorrow, we'll put you in the front of the line.
[02:10:08.936 --> 02:10:10.658]  If you give us your name and number, we'll call you back.
[02:10:11.578 --> 02:10:12.659]  But great job of the crew.
[02:10:12.679 --> 02:10:14.201]  Now, I asked Rob to do this morning, put this together.
[02:10:14.241 --> 02:10:16.623]  He did it hours ago, but I forgot to get to it.
[02:10:17.103 --> 02:10:21.026]  This is a compilation of people finally responding to lies the way they should.
[02:10:21.086 --> 02:10:21.667]  That's coming up.
[02:10:21.967 --> 02:10:23.088]  Then Jay Dyer straight ahead.
[02:10:23.408 --> 02:10:25.150]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[02:10:29.251 --> 02:10:39.251]  [MUSIC]
[02:10:39.251 --> 02:10:43.770]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[02:10:43.770 --> 02:10:45.970]  [MUSIC]
[02:10:45.970 --> 02:10:50.530]   How much longer are we going to refer to the policy at the border
[02:10:50.530 --> 02:10:55.530]   as compassionate when this makes it clear that it is anything but?
[02:10:55.530 --> 02:10:59.371]   Well, I think first and foremost, we have to recognize
[02:10:59.371 --> 02:11:04.354]   that we are a nation of laws, but Republicans talk the big game.
[02:11:04.394 --> 02:11:07.275]  They say they want to make sure that we increase security at the border.
[02:11:07.635 --> 02:11:08.196]  Well, you know what?
[02:11:08.296 --> 02:11:10.856]  Why don't we pass President Biden's 2023 budget?
[02:11:12.697 --> 02:11:15.038]  Hold on, I'm sorry, I had to jump in because you're going back.
[02:11:15.158 --> 02:11:17.980]  I'm talking about what happened with these people, right?
[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:22.202]  I mean, this is the absolute opposite of compassion.
[02:11:22.502 --> 02:11:29.145]  You know better than probably most people who cover this story that the cartels are completely in charge here.
[02:11:29.865 --> 02:11:39.436]  So we are allowing the cartels to abuse these human beings to the point of stranding them on the side of the road with absolute disregard for life.
[02:11:39.516 --> 02:11:45.423]  It's highly possible that these young women were being trafficked for sex in the United States and beyond.
[02:11:45.803 --> 02:11:47.866]  When are we going to stop calling this what it is?
[02:11:48.246 --> 02:11:52.769]  Well look, I understand that and my heart goes out to the families that their migrants have passed.
[02:11:52.849 --> 02:11:56.191]  But what I can tell you is, we need more resources out of the border.
[02:11:56.471 --> 02:11:58.493]  Republicans have blocked us every step of the way.
[02:11:58.533 --> 02:11:59.193]  That's a joke.
[02:11:59.313 --> 02:11:59.834]  That's a joke.
[02:11:59.854 --> 02:12:00.134]  We need money.
[02:12:00.154 --> 02:12:01.274]  That's not a real response.
[02:12:01.294 --> 02:12:02.015]  We need more resources.
[02:12:02.055 --> 02:12:02.855]  No, that's a joke.
[02:12:02.876 --> 02:12:03.656]  We need more technology.
[02:12:03.716 --> 02:12:04.196]  That is not true.
[02:12:04.256 --> 02:12:04.637]  Come on.
[02:12:05.077 --> 02:12:05.677]  It is true.
[02:12:05.717 --> 02:12:06.098]  No, no, no.
[02:12:06.158 --> 02:12:07.318]  No, it is not true.
[02:12:07.398 --> 02:12:08.499]  It is not true.
[02:12:08.719 --> 02:12:11.941]  I have been dealing with this issue for two decades.
[02:12:12.222 --> 02:12:17.185]  And the fact that you continue to engage in these lies, that's not true at all.
[02:12:18.285 --> 02:12:19.325]  This is ridiculous.
[02:12:19.746 --> 02:12:20.846]  This is a choice.
[02:12:20.946 --> 02:12:22.126]  It's a policy choice.
[02:12:22.366 --> 02:12:28.068]  The Biden administration is enabling these cartels to profit from the sadness of these people.
[02:12:28.308 --> 02:12:30.708]  They are leading to this, exactly to this.
[02:12:30.948 --> 02:12:33.669]  This blood is on your hands and you know it.
[02:12:33.809 --> 02:12:38.350]  And no amount of defense that you try to marshal here is going to make up for that.
[02:12:38.510 --> 02:12:40.271]  This is the truth.
[02:12:40.311 --> 02:12:43.972]  The fact is you had majorities in the House and the Senate.
[02:12:44.012 --> 02:12:44.832]  You had the White House.
[02:12:44.892 --> 02:12:52.135]  You could have absolutely done whatever you wanted to do on immigration when you had it in 2008.
[02:12:53.056 --> 02:12:54.216]  Oh, that's a joke.
[02:12:54.436 --> 02:12:55.196]  That's a lie.
[02:12:55.376 --> 02:12:57.137]  You're engaging in a lie here.
[02:12:57.237 --> 02:12:59.178]  You know deep in your heart this is true.
[02:12:59.558 --> 02:13:01.799]  And this fact, you cannot get around it.
[02:13:01.819 --> 02:13:03.219]  Let me jump in here and ask one more question, guys.
[02:13:07.541 --> 02:13:17.305]  Jose, when you look at this situation, I can't even wrap my head around what it was like for the people who were still alive inside of this vehicle.
[02:13:18.105 --> 02:13:26.469]  And I want to go back to the point, the idea that the White House continues to say that the border is closed is so preposterous.
[02:13:27.669 --> 02:13:36.580]  Obviously it is not closed and obviously both sides have lost, both governments on both sides have completely lost control of what's going on at the border.
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:40.124]  The cartels are running the border.
[02:13:40.665 --> 02:13:45.310]   Do you agree with that, Jose, that the cartels are running The border.
[02:13:45.390 --> 02:13:47.471]  And what was the answer of President Trump?
[02:13:47.551 --> 02:13:50.854]  He wanted to build a wall, he built a couple miles of wall, and guess what?
[02:13:51.314 --> 02:13:53.115]  DHS, DHS, let me finish.
[02:13:53.135 --> 02:13:55.117]  You cannot take this seriously.
[02:13:55.177 --> 02:13:55.917]  This is absurd.
[02:13:56.178 --> 02:14:01.802]  He is turning this into a political game when people are dying.
[02:14:01.882 --> 02:14:02.462]  Let me finish.
[02:14:02.843 --> 02:14:08.547]  Over 3,000 smugglers have passed the wall that supposedly President Trump built.
[02:14:08.827 --> 02:14:09.848]  Look at this guy.
[02:14:11.929 --> 02:14:15.150]  You've got no record of being a pro-immigrant!
[02:14:15.170 --> 02:14:16.110]  This is unacceptable!
[02:14:16.390 --> 02:14:18.051]  I'm a pro-immigrant person!
[02:14:18.111 --> 02:14:19.771]  I'm in favor of more immigrants!
[02:14:19.811 --> 02:14:27.754]  And he is engaged in this ridiculous, partisan, and stupid argument that is designed to score points and not designed to stall the Democratic Party!
[02:14:27.834 --> 02:14:36.296]  I'm going to have to wrap it up because we're out of time, but Jose and Ben, you know, thank you for coming, but we do have to get- This is what you get when you bring two Hispanic guys on for the same argument!
[02:14:36.336 --> 02:14:42.176]   Jose, we have to get past the point where this is about pointing political fingers and we have to start caring
[02:14:42.176 --> 02:14:47.797]   about the compassion that is said to be the motivation at the border has clearly
[02:14:47.797 --> 02:14:53.516]   failed in the most heinous way imaginable by what is happening to the lives of
[02:14:53.516 --> 02:14:57.357]   these poor people and these families. So we need to wake up and
[02:14:57.357 --> 02:15:03.548]   understand that arguing I'm your guest host Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis and today I wanted to talk about biblical signs of the end times, the last days.
[02:15:03.387 --> 02:15:07.387]   isn't built, the ball's not going to function, and people are going to get through.
[02:15:07.387 --> 02:15:10.867]   But my, you know, I hate even saying my heart goes out to these families because, you know,
[02:15:10.867 --> 02:15:13.347]  it sounds so trite at this point, but it absolutely does.
[02:15:13.347 --> 02:15:15.467]  I cannot imagine what these individuals went through.
[02:15:15.467 --> 02:15:17.146]  Welcome back to the Oxygen Show.
[02:15:17.146 --> 02:15:20.586]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:15:20.586 --> 02:15:25.988]   And today I wanted to talk about biblical signs of the end times, the last days.
[02:15:25.988 --> 02:15:33.106]   I did an excellent interview a couple days ago with the Australian journalist Maria Z.
[02:15:33.106 --> 02:15:37.547]   She does a lot of really good work in terms of exposing all of the COVID scams and the
[02:15:37.547 --> 02:15:38.827]  lockdowns and all that.
[02:15:38.633 --> 02:15:45.335]  And she asked me to come on and talk about biblical signs of the end times, the Antichrist, Mark of the Beast, and all that kind of stuff.
[02:15:45.775 --> 02:15:56.389]   And I thought it would be good to kind of do an overview of what scripture says about not just the figure of Antichrist, but even types of And images of the Antichrist going all the way back to the Old Testament.
[02:15:56.409 --> 02:15:58.490]  Of course, we know about Nimrod, right?
[02:15:58.530 --> 02:16:05.634]  Nimrod tried to build the Tower of Babel, a tower that would ascend into heaven to basically fly in the face of God.
[02:16:05.734 --> 02:16:14.980]  I don't believe that they really thought they could build a tower to heaven, but they thought they could build a tower in defiance of God, in the worship of God, towards the worship of man.
[02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:15.580]  St.
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:27.245]   Augustine wrote a famous book that I lectured on and did several hours of lectures through the city of God, which is one books in the history of Western literature and the canon of Scripture,
[02:16:29.625 --> 02:17:00.150]   of great lip and you know he characterizes the two cities at war in history the city of God being God's people the church and the city of man being mankind in rebellion against God worshiping by default Satan not necessarily directly but indirectly even through the worship of self so the city of man which is erected around humanism secularism polytheism Satanism you name it versus the city of God, which is the church or God's people.
[02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:05.870]   And so as we move through all the way, you know, the time of Genesis up into, as we said,
[02:17:05.870 --> 02:17:12.550]   the Tower of Babel and the events of Genesis 10, you know, God confuses that situation
[02:17:12.637 --> 02:17:20.224]  In other words, He gives us languages because there was an attempt to unify the world around this single beast type of system and world power.
[02:17:20.765 --> 02:17:27.491]  So Nimrod then becomes a type of every future sort of Antichrist until we get to the final Antichrist figure.
[02:17:28.417 --> 02:17:31.339]  Whenever that is, at the end of days, or at the end of the world.
[02:17:31.499 --> 02:17:37.222]  We don't know when that is, but we know that there will be certain signs, and that's what we're going to look at today, to see what are the biblical signs.
[02:17:37.242 --> 02:17:46.008]  Not what are the headlines, not what are the various preachers' speculations and end times, dates, and all that kind of nonsense, but what are the actual signs that are listed.
[02:17:46.468 --> 02:17:58.304]  And there's other points that I think we want to pay attention to, to see that there will be things like a one-world economic attempt, a one-world government attempt, there will be a one-world religion attempt as well.
[02:17:58.884 --> 02:18:03.971]  All of those factor very prominently into the totality of the message of Scripture, both Old and New Testament when it comes to this.
[02:18:04.011 --> 02:18:10.055]   And also, I'm an Orthodox Christian, so what are the saints of the first thousand years of the church?
[02:18:10.075 --> 02:18:12.877]  What are the great theologians of the first thousand years of the church?
[02:18:12.917 --> 02:18:15.018]  What did they think about the end times?
[02:18:15.079 --> 02:18:19.041]  The very people who compiled the canon of scripture in the first several centuries.
[02:18:19.081 --> 02:18:23.204]  What did they think would be the sign of the last days?
[02:18:23.344 --> 02:18:24.364]  So we'll look at that here in a minute.
[02:18:25.948 --> 02:18:29.049]  As we come through scripture, we see a lot of other types of Antichrist.
[02:18:29.069 --> 02:18:30.870]  We think of the figure of Pharaoh, right?
[02:18:30.890 --> 02:18:36.552]  Pharaoh is a perfect image of Antichrist because he's a state figure who claims to be God.
[02:18:37.312 --> 02:18:38.353]  He sees himself as God.
[02:18:38.393 --> 02:18:47.576]  We know that in Egyptian religion, Pharaoh was kind of the apex of the... You had the heavens that come down like this as a pyramid, and then the earth, earthly rulers go up like this.
[02:18:47.615 --> 02:18:54.095]   and Pharaoh's at the middle of that apex as the bridge between heaven and earth as God himself.
[02:18:54.095 --> 02:18:59.975]   So Pharaoh was a kind of a type of antichrist in that he was an inversion of the incarnation, right?
[02:18:59.975 --> 02:19:01.575]  The son of God becoming man.
[02:19:01.575 --> 02:19:03.454]  Well, Pharaoh said, "No, I am the son of God.
[02:19:03.454 --> 02:19:05.495]  "I am God, I am both man and God."
[02:19:05.495 --> 02:19:11.435]   He's the man God that should be worshiped as the great image of the beast system or the state.
[02:19:11.435 --> 02:19:14.556]   And so he, of course, persecuted God's people as everybody knows in Exodus.
[02:19:14.556 --> 02:19:20.175]   And we have the plagues, which ironically, if you look into the history of that,
[02:19:20.175 --> 02:19:24.216]   each plague is actually an attack on a specific Egyptian deity.
[02:19:24.247 --> 02:19:30.052]  So there's kind of a spiritual battle of apologetics going on there in terms of the different deities that are being attacked.
[02:19:30.092 --> 02:19:32.994]  And so Pharaoh then is clearly a type of Antichrist.
[02:19:33.375 --> 02:19:40.461]  Other figures that could be types of Antichrist, not just the other pagan emperors and rulers, but the figure actually of Solomon.
[02:19:40.861 --> 02:19:55.440]   And the reason Solomon is a curious type of Antichrist is that Solomon started out very good as we know from the historical books of Scripture, but then he had so many wives, he got into such a fascination with
[02:19:56.169 --> 02:20:02.132]  The ladies, we'll say, that he caved in and started worshipping the gods of his wives, right?
[02:20:02.492 --> 02:20:08.075]  So the gods of his wives were all the surrounding pagan beliefs, and then he allowed that to come into Israel.
[02:20:08.115 --> 02:20:15.638]  And so we see a gradual decline in the faithfulness and the kingdom under the person of Solomon, who, as we said, begins very good.
[02:20:15.658 --> 02:20:37.745]   So Solomon becomes a kind of a dual type, both of the apostasy of the church that Paul talks about in 2 Thessalonians, And of the evil of the Antichrist in the sense that there's a specific text in scripture that not many people know about where it says that Solomon brought in 666 talents of gold as a sort of a tax that he would do, right?
[02:20:38.345 --> 02:20:49.349]   And so that's I think a key indicator that that number, that mystical number of 666 that John talks about in the Apocalypse, We're supposed to connect that also to the idea of the apostasy of Solomon.
[02:20:49.890 --> 02:21:02.343]  And so that becomes, in a nutshell, also a kind of a microcosm of the apostasy of the life of the nation of Israel, who eventually, you know, goes against God in so many cases in the Old Testament.
[02:21:02.363 --> 02:21:15.290]   The prophets have to call them back, right, out of that Out of that apostasy, so we can see an image of both the false religion of the future and the false state ruler Antichrist the beast in the figure of Solomon as well.
[02:21:16.210 --> 02:21:18.551]  Other figures like Nimrod, excuse me, Nebuchadnezzar.
[02:21:18.611 --> 02:21:26.775]  If you read the book of Daniel, you'll notice that the great idol that Nebuchadnezzar erects and then says you have to, you know, worship this, fall down before this.
[02:21:26.835 --> 02:21:29.516]  And of course, everybody knows the story of Daniel and his friends.
[02:21:29.556 --> 02:21:33.636]   they don't do it and they're put into the fiery furnace and we see in the
[02:21:33.636 --> 02:21:38.636]   midst of the fiery furnace one like the Son of Man standing amongst them. That's
[02:21:38.636 --> 02:21:41.636]   of course the angel the Lord who throughout the Old Testament has always
[02:21:41.636 --> 02:21:46.156]   given this form, this appearance, or what's called a theophany or a
[02:21:46.156 --> 02:21:49.595]   manifestation and he's always distinguished from the person of God the
[02:21:49.595 --> 02:21:53.595]   Father throughout the Old Testament. So this angel the Lord figure, at least
[02:21:53.595 --> 02:21:56.915]   according to the the classic Orthodox Christian interpretation of the church
[02:21:56.915 --> 02:22:00.915]   fathers and so forth, that is the person of Christ before his incarnation.
[02:22:01.357 --> 02:22:03.838]  So we see the messenger of the Lord, right?
[02:22:03.958 --> 02:22:06.859]  Angel doesn't always mean a created being, it can just mean a messenger.
[02:22:07.199 --> 02:22:14.041]  The angel of the Lord, the messenger of the Lord, is called God, he's called Yahweh, he's called divine.
[02:22:15.134 --> 02:22:18.797]  And that's who's there, spoken of in the myths of the fiery furnace, the angel of the Lord.
[02:22:19.498 --> 02:22:27.905]  Now, as we go into other texts, we see other characters who, as I said, are very, very clear emblematic figures of Antichrist.
[02:22:27.945 --> 02:22:34.990]  One of those is in the books that are not in the Protestant canon of Scripture, but are in the Catholic and Orthodox canon of Scripture, in the books of the Maccabees.
[02:22:35.431 --> 02:22:48.258]   And we find in the books of the Maccabees this figure, Antiochus Epiphanes, and he's important because He engages in this event that will become later cited by Christ in the Synoptic Gospels as the abomination of desolation.
[02:22:48.278 --> 02:23:07.530]   It's the abomination spoken of by the prophet Daniel, and I think that Daniel is talking about, especially in those latter chapters, Alexander the Great and then the people who were his sort of underlings who took over after him, one of whom was the most famous Antichrist figure, Antiochus Epiphanes.
[02:23:07.570 --> 02:23:15.956]  And of course, if you read the Book of Maccabees, you know that Antiochus goes into the temple and defiles it by sacrificing a pig on the altar viewed as an unclean animal.
[02:23:16.376 --> 02:23:21.680]  This is a great defilement and it's called the Abomination of Desolation that Daniel predicts.
[02:23:22.313 --> 02:23:35.137]  So when Jesus references this in the Gospels in Matthew 24 and Luke 21, He's referring back to the text in Daniel and He says in Luke 19 that you will see this temple raised to the ground.
[02:23:35.177 --> 02:23:39.359]  You and your children, there will not be one stone left upon this.
[02:23:39.419 --> 02:23:40.819]  This is Luke 19.
[02:23:43.620 --> 02:23:46.381]  I can barely see the... I can't see the verses here, but...
[02:23:48.087 --> 02:23:51.032]  It's right at the end of Luke 19 right before he cleanses the temple.
[02:23:51.072 --> 02:24:10.003]   He says that the temple and all of its bricks will be raised to the ground and he even says that it will come upon this generation in Luke 21 because they didn't know the time of their visitation and this was the This was the vindication and the vengeance of all things spoken in the prophets, he says in Matthew 23, coming upon this generation, that is the generation standing in front of him.
[02:24:10.103 --> 02:24:18.369]  So this is what's called partial preterism, the idea that a lot of the texts that are talking about the destruction of the temple will be fulfilled in 70 AD.
[02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:25.274]  And this is very important for Christian prophecy and proving Christianity because these prove that Jesus' predictions did come true.
[02:24:25.414 --> 02:24:27.115]  There is an end times fulfillment.
[02:24:27.515 --> 02:24:34.317]  But the immediate context, if you read Luke 19, especially Luke 21, Jesus is very clearly talking about the temple in his day.
[02:24:34.797 --> 02:24:37.978]  He even says, this temple here that you see will be raised to the ground.
[02:24:37.998 --> 02:24:41.539]  That will be a sign of the diaspora that occurs.
[02:24:41.559 --> 02:24:47.581]  That will be a sign of the judgment that's to come, the 70 AD destruction of the temple.
[02:24:48.121 --> 02:25:08.453]   That is, and so the character there, Titus Vespasian, is another Antichrist type of figure, just like Antiochus Epiphanes, who was a Greek, And now you have Titus the Roman, so both the Greeks and the Romans engage in this profanation and this blasphemous event, right, which is part of those covenantal sanctions and punishments for Israel's apostasy.
[02:25:08.473 --> 02:25:09.454]  Don't go anywhere, we'll be right back.
[02:25:09.834 --> 02:25:13.478]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, this is Jay Dyer of jaysandalsos.com.
[02:25:13.498 --> 02:25:41.262]   We're working our way through the historical types, the figures who are emblematic of Antichrist The final Antichrist who will come and we're looking for the signs that will be present when that figure emerges and we can see elements of that final figure in the historical Antichrist figures that have come and we're working our way up through the Old Testament and we got up to the New Testament period when we have after Antiochus Epiphanes there's a another lesser-known book Third Maccabees that not many people know about
[02:25:41.914 --> 02:25:52.338]  But that also describes a figure named Ptolemy, an Egyptian ruler as well, who also repeats this pattern of trying to profane the temple and take over and destroy Israel.
[02:25:52.759 --> 02:26:04.624]  And there's a specific text at the very beginning of 3rd Maccabees where it says that he tries to basically catalog and mark and track all of his empire and all those under him.
[02:26:04.684 --> 02:26:13.907]   And that becomes another key type, historical type figure, because we know, of course, in Revelation 13 that Antichrist, at the end, will do the same type of thing.
[02:26:13.947 --> 02:26:24.229]  He will try to control all commerce and all food and so forth through a mark upon every citizen in some way, however that may be.
[02:26:24.629 --> 02:26:28.950]  I think we're beginning to see inklings of that with the kinds of systems that are rolling out.
[02:26:28.970 --> 02:26:37.632]  I don't think that we're looking at the Mark of the Beast system, but it's definitely that spirit and that kind of thing that we've seen in the last few years rolling out.
[02:26:38.192 --> 02:26:54.078]  And so, the reason we look at these historical patterns is to show that the spirit of Antichrist, the spirit of Satan, does the same thing over and over, and they try to incarnate and instantiate the same program, the same plan, over and over and over.
[02:26:54.118 --> 02:27:30.998]   And that's part of the message of Scripture, is telling us that very thing, that this demonic spirit, this power in the universe that wants to destroy man, that wants to Basically destroy the universe right is engaged in the same playbook over and over and it can almost like it's almost like it can't but do that right and So from the time of Babel and we come all the way up to the time of Christ We see it repeated once again and Herod the figure of Herod becomes another version of this because if you remember he does the same thing that Pharaoh did right he has tries to have the infants murdered and ultimately we see this as he actually has them murdered right and
[02:27:32.593 --> 02:27:37.115]  And he does this out of an attempt to destroy the lineage of the Messiah, right?
[02:27:37.155 --> 02:27:51.882]  I think that whether it's Pharaoh or whether it's Herod, we're told in the New Testament that the motivation for this going after and destroying and murdering the infants is to destroy the lineage of the Messiah, which we know would come through the Jews.
[02:27:52.866 --> 02:28:01.373]  So, and of course, you know, abortion is also a satanic sacrifice just in itself, right, apart from trying to destroy the Messianic lineage.
[02:28:01.433 --> 02:28:12.022]  But the main reason in Scripture is said to be that, you know, Satan wanted to get rid of the line through which the Messiah would come, right, the descendants of Abraham, the descendants of David.
[02:28:13.547 --> 02:28:19.370]  And so we can see then that repeated pattern of trying to create that world government.
[02:28:19.431 --> 02:28:22.572]  But another thing that comes about is, as we said, this sign.
[02:28:22.592 --> 02:28:27.155]  So the first sign is the attempt to unify everybody, to destroy the church, destroy God's people.
[02:28:27.195 --> 02:28:48.685]   This attempt to Subvert the church in a unique and bizarre way through which we do get inklings of this as we said in Old Testament Israel Through getting the church to compromise getting the church to water its message, and it's teaching down getting them to teach doctrines that are conformable to the standards of the world and not to God standards so for example
[02:28:49.165 --> 02:28:52.927]  The moral decline that we've seen, these kinds of things are obvious signs.
[02:28:52.967 --> 02:28:54.648]  Of course, we've always seen that in history, right?
[02:28:55.048 --> 02:28:57.089]  So, what's the real essence of the end times?
[02:28:57.109 --> 02:29:02.611]  Well, according to the second Thessalonians, Paul says that the Church will undergo a massive apostasy.
[02:29:02.651 --> 02:29:07.534]  We'll see more and more and more of the Church caving to that idea.
[02:29:07.554 --> 02:29:11.715]  And in my view, this is my opinion based on many of the Church Fathers, like St.
[02:29:11.735 --> 02:29:13.496]  Cyril of Alexandria.
[02:29:13.516 --> 02:29:22.530]   In a lot of his interpretation of Scripture, he believes that The largely gentile church, now there have always been Jewish believers in every age of the church, but
[02:29:23.368 --> 02:29:38.301]  The idea, based on Romans 11, that the largely, mainly Gentile church will eventually apostatize, and then we'll begin to see more and more Jews convert to the faith and be grafted in according to what Paul says.
[02:29:38.361 --> 02:29:42.161]   And so this is typically, even the Orthodox Church, many of its saints and elders have
[02:29:42.161 --> 02:29:46.200]   pointed out that one of the key signs that we would be living in the last days would
[02:29:46.200 --> 02:29:51.521]   be more and more Jews converting to authentic Christianity, in my view, to Orthodox Christianity,
[02:29:51.521 --> 02:29:52.880]  and we would see a revival.
[02:29:52.880 --> 02:29:57.661]   So that is one of the signs that's listed, as well as a massive apostasy of the largely
[02:29:57.661 --> 02:29:58.661]  Gentile church.
[02:29:58.661 --> 02:30:02.200]   It doesn't mean there won't be still Gentile believers in the end times or anything like
[02:30:02.455 --> 02:30:05.776]  There would be, but it's sort of a reversal, right?
[02:30:05.816 --> 02:30:13.860]  In the first century, you had the Jews not accepting, on the whole, in terms of the national acceptance of the message of Christ.
[02:30:14.300 --> 02:30:23.184]  And then at the end, you kind of get a flip where most of the Gentile church, where Jesus talks about the times of the Gentiles coming to an end, it'll flip to where you'll have a conversion of the Jews.
[02:30:23.405 --> 02:30:25.586]  And I think that's what Romans 11 is talking about.
[02:30:27.286 --> 02:30:30.755]   And so, you know, But I think both of these things are taught in scripture.
[02:30:30.775 --> 02:30:32.376]  I don't think that it's a either or.
[02:30:32.416 --> 02:30:38.759]  We have to fall over into these extremes that a lot of people fall over into when it comes to these sort of difficult, controversial questions.
[02:30:40.512 --> 02:30:49.781]  But regardless, when we consider that figure of Antichrist, one of the key figures that we have to look at as an end times emblem would be the figure of Nero.
[02:30:49.941 --> 02:30:53.124]  I believe that there's a great book written by Dr. Ken Gentry.
[02:30:53.785 --> 02:30:56.627]  It's a PhD thesis on the dating of the Book of Revelation.
[02:30:56.647 --> 02:31:01.047]   He makes a really strong argument that it was written prior to 100 AD.
[02:31:01.047 --> 02:31:05.727]   And he argues that the best figure that could, in the first century, fit this image of Antichrist
[02:31:05.727 --> 02:31:06.727]  would be Nero.
[02:31:06.727 --> 02:31:11.647]   Nero Caesar, of course, was a rabid persecutor of the Church and of Christianity.
[02:31:11.647 --> 02:31:16.006]   And one of the key indicators that this could be the case is that John in the Apocalypse
[02:31:16.006 --> 02:31:20.967]  is using 666 as a form of Gematria.
[02:31:20.956 --> 02:31:31.004]  Now I don't mean that in a weird esoteric sense, just in the sense of a code, because in the ancient world languages functioned also as their numerical indicators, right?
[02:31:31.044 --> 02:31:35.127]  So alpha would be the number one, beta would be the number two in the Greek.
[02:31:35.588 --> 02:31:39.831]  And so what's interesting is that there are textual variants of the apocalypse.
[02:31:40.667 --> 02:31:42.688]  Specifically where it mentions the 666.
[02:31:43.828 --> 02:32:10.832]   There's a few manuscripts that mention 616 and interestingly you can tease out of that Nero Caesar in both the 666 and the 616 which is a really strong indicator that John writing in code and wanting to mention you know to the seven churches of Asia Minor the figure of Antichrist the beast under the guise of Rome and we know it's Rome because he says the city on seven hills where the beast is and He's definitely talking about, in my view, Nero Caesar.
[02:32:11.732 --> 02:32:20.914]  And so that's, again, a very important indicator that proves that a lot of Jesus' prophecies and predictions in Luke 21 and Matthew 24 are fulfilled in 70 AD.
[02:32:20.934 --> 02:32:27.375]  And that proves to us the New Testament proves, in part, the veracity of Jesus' messages, especially in the Olivet Discourse.
[02:32:27.795 --> 02:32:34.597]  That's why the Book of the Apocalypse, again, written to seven actual historical churches in Asia Minor, and by the way, several of those churches still exist.
[02:32:34.957 --> 02:32:36.737]  Several of those Orthodox churches still exist.
[02:32:37.481 --> 02:32:38.542]  Orthodox Church of Ephesus.
[02:32:38.842 --> 02:32:46.389]  It traces its lineage all the way back to the time when John was writing his letters to them, the bishops of Ephesus, right?
[02:32:47.070 --> 02:32:51.013]  And, you know, he begins that letter by saying, these things will quickly come to pass.
[02:32:52.074 --> 02:33:01.122]  Well, if the book is primarily about stuff 2,000 years later, it doesn't really have much reference to the people at that time who got the message that it would quickly come to pass, right?
[02:33:01.262 --> 02:33:04.285]  Remember, Jesus said that a lot of these things would come upon this generation.
[02:33:05.037 --> 02:33:08.518]  So I do think there's end times events, but I think the events of 70 A.D.
[02:33:08.718 --> 02:33:11.459]  are a type of the end time events, right?
[02:33:11.499 --> 02:33:12.620]  And that's the Orthodox view.
[02:33:12.640 --> 02:33:26.565]  There's a great book put out by Jordanville Monastery, which is an Orthodox monastery, which is a collection of saints, elders, and church fathers on their takes on the history or from the history of the church on Antichrist and apostasy.
[02:33:26.605 --> 02:33:29.166]  And they make this point that the destruction of the temple in 70 A.D.
[02:33:29.246 --> 02:33:33.187]  is a type of the end of the world because the temple is an emblem of the universe.
[02:33:33.999 --> 02:33:41.224]  And so it's being destroyed and raised as an emblem of the heavens and the earth being rolled up as Hebrews talks about at the end of the world, right?
[02:33:41.244 --> 02:33:44.287]  So it's kind of like a pre-signifier of the end times.
[02:33:44.747 --> 02:33:54.214]  And we can look at other figures like Nero and so forth as a final Antichrist, just as we saw that mirroring event going back to Antiochus and others in the past.
[02:33:55.315 --> 02:33:56.656]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:56.696 --> 02:33:59.117]  This is your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:33:59.137 --> 02:34:20.915]   We're talking about We're talking about Antichrist and specifically the biblical signs of the end times, what those would be, and we were looking at different historical figures who were types of Antichrist, and we had just gotten to the figure of Nero, Nero Caesar, who heavily persecuted the church right around the time of John the Revelator and the
[02:34:23.852 --> 02:34:40.200]  The time of the destruction of the temple in 70 AD where his general Titus Vespasian comes in and destroys the temple in much the same fashion as Antiochus Epiphanes had done and all the way back to the Babylonians who sacked the temple first back in 586 BC.
[02:34:40.240 --> 02:34:49.464]  So we're seeing this repeated pattern and you know if you read 2 Thessalonians Paul goes on to talk about the other element that we got to get to which is the end times delusion.
[02:34:51.127 --> 02:34:51.547]  What is that?
[02:34:51.607 --> 02:35:01.515]  Well, he says that before the coming of Antichrist, he says there will be an apostasy and he talks about a falling away and this will reveal the man of sin.
[02:35:01.535 --> 02:35:08.921]  He says that the man of sin will exalt himself and oppose himself to all gods and all figures and all entities or anything called God.
[02:35:09.958 --> 02:35:12.860]  So that he will sit in the temple and proclaim himself to be God.
[02:35:13.381 --> 02:35:19.626]  Now, in the history of the church there have been, all the way back for 2,000 years, there have been basically two different interpretations of this text.
[02:35:19.746 --> 02:35:21.387]  I don't have any certainty.
[02:35:21.448 --> 02:35:23.689]  I mean, I could see either one of them being true.
[02:35:24.110 --> 02:35:34.018]  One of them is the idea that there will be an actual third temple rebuilt and that that would be the temple that Antichrist would stand up in and proclaim himself to be God in.
[02:35:35.126 --> 02:35:47.515]  The other view is that the temple of God here is symbolically speaking of the church, the church as God's true new temple, and that it would be a figure who invades the church, so to speak, and calls himself God.
[02:35:48.195 --> 02:35:50.157]  Either one, I think, is possible and makes sense.
[02:35:50.197 --> 02:36:08.307]   Many of the church fathers do tend to think that a new rebuilt temple would be the actual sign of Antichrist, and so many of the Orthodox elders and church fathers and saints do make this point to say that If you're looking for a couple of the key signs of the final, final end times, one of those would be the move towards a world religion.
[02:36:08.807 --> 02:36:10.928]  One of those would be the move towards a world state.
[02:36:11.568 --> 02:36:16.789]  One of those would be the persecution and shutting down of classical traditional Christianity in all forms.
[02:36:17.509 --> 02:36:29.453]  And another one of those would be the attempt to subvert the church and turn it into a world religion and to control and track and trace everybody's moves, everybody's economic transactions and so forth.
[02:36:29.493 --> 02:36:30.653]  So those are the key signs.
[02:36:31.295 --> 02:36:33.676]  And then the last one being a conversion of the Jews.
[02:36:34.316 --> 02:36:36.457]  So according to Orthodoxy, that's our view.
[02:36:36.477 --> 02:36:37.978]  We think that those are the real signs.
[02:36:38.258 --> 02:36:39.358]  Are we in the last days?
[02:36:39.699 --> 02:36:40.039]  I don't know.
[02:36:40.139 --> 02:36:40.719]  I can't say.
[02:36:40.739 --> 02:36:42.400]  That's not my position to say.
[02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:45.841]  But I can say that these are the signs that we should look for.
[02:36:45.921 --> 02:36:48.182]  And these are the ones that I think scripture talks about.
[02:36:49.102 --> 02:36:56.345]  And the most fascinating here is this idea of the complete leaving of Christianity by the nations, right?
[02:36:56.585 --> 02:37:00.147]  We have this idea that there will be a great falling away, a great apostasy.
[02:37:00.894 --> 02:37:08.837]  Presumably amongst professing Christianity to accept some kind of world religion, some kind of New Age presumably type of thing.
[02:37:09.897 --> 02:37:14.076]   In the apocalypse, we have this important figure who is the false prophet.
[02:37:14.076 --> 02:37:19.057]   And we don't exactly know who it is or what it is, but it seems to be a figure who has
[02:37:19.057 --> 02:37:24.736]   the ability to deceive the nations in a religious way, whereas Antichrist is specifically a
[02:37:24.736 --> 02:37:26.736]  state figure, right?
[02:37:26.736 --> 02:37:31.456]   And we know that in the apocalypse, there's this period where it says that the whore,
[02:37:31.456 --> 02:37:33.256]  this false religion, rides the beast.
[02:37:33.256 --> 02:37:36.936]  And so they're allied for a time period at the end.
[02:37:36.936 --> 02:37:40.856]   And then it says that Antichrist decides to cast off the woman, doesn't need her anymore,
[02:37:40.856 --> 02:37:42.417]  and proclaims himself to be God, right?
[02:37:42.417 --> 02:37:47.576]   So there's this period where there's a sort of false union and, "Oh, let's all love each
[02:37:47.576 --> 02:37:51.457]   other and we're going to bring world peace," and this kind of stuff.
[02:37:51.473 --> 02:37:53.654]  And the false prophet, this sort of...
[02:37:54.982 --> 02:38:01.864]  False religious leader of the end times deceives the nations and points them to Antichrist and then eventually Antichrist says I'm done with you.
[02:38:01.904 --> 02:38:02.404]  I don't need you.
[02:38:02.424 --> 02:38:03.585]  I don't need your stupid fake religion.
[02:38:04.325 --> 02:38:05.525]  I'm the true God here, right?
[02:38:05.565 --> 02:38:17.609]  And I think that's what Paul's getting at here is this final act of blasphemy and we get really clear indicators here and in the apocalypse that this is an intentional inversion of the incarnation.
[02:38:18.149 --> 02:38:31.675]   So if you remember Jesus becoming incarnate At his first advent, right, coming to earth, the second person of God had becoming man, living his life on earth, teaching us, dying for redemption, for our sins, to bring us to the resurrection.
[02:38:32.295 --> 02:38:47.709]  We get an inversion of that in the apocalypse with the figure of Antichrist who, instead of claiming to be God, is essentially demonically possessed, many of the church fathers say, and that's the source of his charisma and his ability to charm the nations and whatnot.
[02:38:48.369 --> 02:38:56.894]  And he sort of mimics the life of Christ in many ways, even to the point of an apparent wound where he revives from.
[02:38:56.954 --> 02:39:07.021]  And by the way, there was an event in Nero's life where something like this happened, whether it's a complete deception or whether it's some demonic event or miracle, or who knows, an evil miracle, we don't know.
[02:39:07.041 --> 02:39:14.265]  But it's something like that where, again, it mimics the life of Christ, right, to survive some sort of death-type experience.
[02:39:15.211 --> 02:39:16.412]  We're to come back from the dead.
[02:39:16.732 --> 02:39:20.995]  But we're told that, of course, he deceives the nations through all kinds of lying signs and wonders.
[02:39:21.795 --> 02:39:25.237]  And the religion of Antichrist does the same thing, right?
[02:39:25.277 --> 02:39:28.219]  It points to him and it involves a mass deception.
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:37.045]  It could be something like what we see with the New Age and the gurus and all the, you know, Madame Blavatsky, Great White Brotherhood and Maitreya.
[02:39:37.065 --> 02:39:38.005]  It could be something like that.
[02:39:38.386 --> 02:39:40.627]  It could be a thing that has yet to come that we haven't seen yet.
[02:39:41.348 --> 02:39:47.614]   It could be something, you know, related to The so-called discovery of off-world entities or aliens, right?
[02:39:47.654 --> 02:39:49.074]  It could be a new alien deception.
[02:39:49.114 --> 02:39:49.755]  We don't know, right?
[02:39:49.775 --> 02:39:52.376]  It might be 500 years from now.
[02:39:52.396 --> 02:39:53.116]  It might be a thousand years.
[02:39:53.136 --> 02:39:53.476]  We don't know.
[02:39:53.496 --> 02:40:05.502]  But whatever or whenever it comes, we will definitely see those signs of a new type of religion probably masquerading, as Paul seems to say here, under the guise of a new type of Christianity, a new universal religion.
[02:40:06.621 --> 02:40:09.522]  Very plausible too that it could be a Pope type of figure.
[02:40:09.982 --> 02:40:28.809]  I don't think the present Pope is the Antichrist or the False Prophet, I'm not saying that, but it could be something like that in the future of a fallen away global world religion that then seeks to turn everyone, not to Jesus, but to some new kind of state-run religion or something like that.
[02:40:29.609 --> 02:40:34.311]  They might try to tie it into transhumanism, a new type of promise of immortality, right?
[02:40:34.935 --> 02:40:56.311]   So I think that when we look for the fact that we're told that Antichrist and the final deception will really involve a mimicking of Christianity, we can begin to look for the patterns and the signs of what Historic Christianity teaches and offers, and then we'll see that the end times deception is the mimic of that.
[02:40:56.411 --> 02:40:58.493]  It's the cheap copy of that.
[02:40:59.053 --> 02:41:03.897]  That, for example, as we said, eternal life through technology and transhumanism.
[02:41:04.998 --> 02:41:07.379]  Solving all the economic crises, right?
[02:41:07.419 --> 02:41:09.601]  And poverty through tracking and tracing, right?
[02:41:09.921 --> 02:41:13.984]  Oh, if we could just track and trace everything and then we could create a fair world order.
[02:41:14.024 --> 02:41:14.985]  Something like that, right?
[02:41:15.625 --> 02:41:17.225]  Uh, the idea of the world religion.
[02:41:17.346 --> 02:41:18.926]  Oh, we don't need dogmas anymore.
[02:41:19.006 --> 02:41:23.767]  We don't need the Bible and Trinity and those, those, uh, boring old dusty doctrines.
[02:41:23.807 --> 02:41:29.268]  What we need is something new about the inner Christ, the inner God, the inner spirit, the inner consciousness.
[02:41:30.028 --> 02:41:31.909]  Uh, you know, it could be anything like that.
[02:41:32.049 --> 02:41:32.649]  Meditate.
[02:41:32.689 --> 02:41:39.451]  It could be, uh, you know, the alien space brothers or the Bible is really a Gnostic text about the alien space brothers.
[02:41:39.631 --> 02:41:39.971]  Who knows?
[02:41:39.991 --> 02:41:40.751]  It could be any of those things.
[02:41:41.471 --> 02:41:46.516]  But all of those things tend to, what we do see is that there's always a convergence, right?
[02:41:46.556 --> 02:42:01.350]  The convergence towards, if we only got rid of nation states, if we only got rid of families, if we only got rid of these patriarchal oppressive things, then we could have true equality, liberty, equality, and fraternity, right?
[02:42:01.410 --> 02:42:02.832]  The illuminous dictum.
[02:42:03.746 --> 02:42:10.232]  If we could have those things, then we would all be free from the, what does Psalm 2 say, you know, the nation's rage.
[02:42:10.272 --> 02:42:13.955]  How can we be free from the cords of the Lord and His Messiah, right, in Psalm 2?
[02:42:14.455 --> 02:42:22.842]  So that's the spirit of Antichrist there, again manifested clearly at the end in this move towards the resurrection of Babel.
[02:42:23.383 --> 02:42:27.446]  Remember that it's just like in, what did Jesus say, in the days of Noah, right?
[02:42:28.047 --> 02:42:31.230]  Right around the same time you have the Nimrod-Babel situation.
[02:42:32.023 --> 02:42:40.292]  The end in times, we'll see very similar situations where there will be an attempt towards this global order, a Babel, Tower of Babel type of thing.
[02:42:41.873 --> 02:42:44.196]  And that's what all those previous empires had tried to do.
[02:42:44.216 --> 02:42:49.961]  You ever wonder why all the ancient world empires tried to do the exact same thing?
[02:42:50.402 --> 02:42:55.327]  Why would they try to exalt the emperor as the god figure?
[02:42:55.914 --> 02:42:57.718]  Why did they try to create a one world order?
[02:42:57.978 --> 02:43:01.044]  Why did they try to create a one imperial religion?
[02:43:01.425 --> 02:43:02.287]  Why'd they do all those things?
[02:43:02.307 --> 02:43:04.812]  Well, because they were motivated by the same spirit.
[02:43:05.954 --> 02:43:07.698]  The same demonic entity.
[02:43:10.083 --> 02:43:12.703]  Satan was behind those world religions, that's what I'm trying to say, right?
[02:43:12.763 --> 02:43:14.584]  Or those imperial world religions, I should say.
[02:43:15.284 --> 02:43:25.086]  And then it doesn't change until, according to Daniel 2, in the Roman Empire, the Messiah is born, and this crushes that fourth empire, which is Rome.
[02:43:25.386 --> 02:43:27.586]  That's the empire under which Jesus was born.
[02:43:27.606 --> 02:43:28.786]  It's not an end times empire.
[02:43:29.406 --> 02:43:34.347]  Daniel 2 is talking about the birth of the Messiah in the Roman Empire, which happened at his first advent.
[02:43:35.347 --> 02:43:39.248]  And then he sets up his kingdom, which will never be destroyed, and which will overtake the rest of the kingdoms.
[02:43:39.921 --> 02:43:41.201]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:41.562 --> 02:43:44.222]  I'm Jay Dyer, your guest host for the fourth hour here.
[02:43:44.262 --> 02:43:52.265]  We're talking about signs of the end times, the types of Antichrist, and what are the authentic biblical patterns that we should look for?
[02:43:52.305 --> 02:43:53.325]  And of course, there's many others.
[02:43:53.385 --> 02:43:55.646]  I was just trying to boil it down to some of the key ones.
[02:43:55.946 --> 02:44:03.608]  We know about, you know, there will be plagues and famines and all those kinds of things, sure, but the real key signs, because those always exist, right?
[02:44:03.647 --> 02:44:08.747]   But I think that we have to look for other key indicators that don't always exist, such
[02:44:08.747 --> 02:44:17.347]   as the conversion of the Jews, such as a massive apostasy of Christianity, an attempt to create
[02:44:17.347 --> 02:44:22.447]   a one world religion that is in ways patterned on or similar to Christianity, but more of
[02:44:22.447 --> 02:44:27.607]   a pseudo Christianity, more of a pseudo universal religion that kind of probably integrates
[02:44:27.607 --> 02:44:30.727]  all of the religious leaders and all the cults.
[02:44:31.185 --> 02:44:37.571]  And cults are another thing, like the explosion of false religions, explosions of cults, explosions of demonic activities, Satanism.
[02:44:37.671 --> 02:44:43.056]  I think all of these would be under that umbrella of a false end times religion that we should look for.
[02:44:45.414 --> 02:44:52.378]  The Mark of the Beast, whatever that will be, some sort of chip, some sort of nanotech, we don't know yet, a future thing that's coming.
[02:44:52.398 --> 02:44:56.641]  I definitely think, as we've said, the last couple of years we see a pattern or a type of that kind of thing.
[02:44:56.822 --> 02:45:10.271]  And again, if you're looking for really good proof that the biblical theology is true, we don't have to look much further than the fact that doesn't it seem to accurately describe this recurring pattern in history, and that it will occur again, right?
[02:45:10.471 --> 02:45:18.017]   Talking about the attempt to create a one-world religion, a one-world currency, a one-world All under the aegis of nothing to do with Jesus.
[02:45:18.397 --> 02:45:24.283]  So just make sure you get rid of him, or rebrand him into something a little more palatable, right?
[02:45:24.323 --> 02:45:28.968]  Cut out a lot of those texts where he talks about, you know, John 14 6 being the way, the truth, and the life.
[02:45:29.628 --> 02:45:30.669]  None of that stuff, right?
[02:45:30.689 --> 02:45:35.129]   Just make it like Christ's consciousness and he's one of the many avatars and one of the
[02:45:35.129 --> 02:45:37.368]  many world teachers, right?
[02:45:37.368 --> 02:45:40.849]  This is the ecumenist new age religion of the Rockefellers.
[02:45:40.849 --> 02:45:46.528]   We're really into advocating and promoting according to their authorized biography.
[02:45:46.528 --> 02:45:49.068]  So those are the key signs to look for.
[02:45:49.068 --> 02:45:52.888]   And I don't think we have to get too crazy into the speculations about dates and this
[02:45:52.888 --> 02:45:53.648]  kind of stuff.
[02:45:54.111 --> 02:45:59.795]  We don't need to know the date and the hour because we know the signs that will precede that final end times situation.
[02:45:59.815 --> 02:46:14.046]  Obviously there will be a lot of persecution, there will be a lot of martyrs of real authentic Christianity, and then we have the final resurrection and the Great White Throne Judgment, which the last few chapters of the Apocalypse talk about as a future-oriented scenario.
[02:46:14.758 --> 02:46:16.439]  So that's my take on that.
[02:46:17.499 --> 02:46:21.941]  As I said, a really good book, if you want to go further into this, is Dr. Ken Gentry's book, Before Jerusalem Fell.
[02:46:22.402 --> 02:46:31.726]  There's a really good commentary written by a guy who was kind of into the Anglican sphere of theology and was getting really close to becoming Orthodox towards the end of his life, but he died before that.
[02:46:32.306 --> 02:46:39.570]  A guy named David Chilton wrote a really good book called Days of Vengeance, which is a really excellent long commentary on the book of the Apocalypse.
[02:46:40.515 --> 02:46:49.100]  There's another book by Milton Terry called Biblical Apocalyptics, or George Peter Holford's book The Destruction of Jerusalem, or David Chilton's book Paradise Restored.
[02:46:49.681 --> 02:46:54.164]  Those are all texts that I really recommend that have influenced me quite a bit.
[02:46:54.304 --> 02:46:58.086]  And to really show the Orthodox view, I would say look at the sermons of St.
[02:46:58.126 --> 02:47:01.909]  John Chrysostom on Matthew 24, or the teachings of St.
[02:47:01.929 --> 02:47:04.510]  Cyril of Jerusalem, as well as St.
[02:47:04.530 --> 02:47:07.732]  Cyril of Alexandria, both of those Church Fathers that discuss these topics.
[02:47:09.893 --> 02:47:18.799]  In good depth, but I also want to note that to change it up a little bit, although it's kind of related to this, my third book is about to come out.
[02:47:18.839 --> 02:47:24.503]  It just went to the printer a couple days ago, so it should be arriving in the next week or two.
[02:47:25.184 --> 02:47:27.885]  And I'm happy to say that this is a little different.
[02:47:27.905 --> 02:47:38.931]   Everybody knows if you like my stuff, if you've not seen my first two books, they dealt with Hollywood, Esoteric Hollywood 1 and 2, where we covered A lot of movies and directors and inside stuff relating to Hollywood.
[02:47:38.971 --> 02:47:42.253]  And I'd written most of those articles, you know, 10, 11 years ago.
[02:47:42.633 --> 02:47:46.914]  So they ended up being in a weird way, in a providential way, kind of prophetic.
[02:47:46.954 --> 02:47:47.874]  I'm not saying I'm a prophet.
[02:47:47.934 --> 02:47:48.295]  I'm not.
[02:47:48.315 --> 02:48:01.199]  But because I talked about a lot of the Hollywood style scandals and the blackmail, the, you know, blackmail networks that we see out there now that have been talked about a lot in the last few years.
[02:48:01.219 --> 02:48:04.200]  You know, I'd covered a lot of that stuff in my book many years ago.
[02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:09.925]  And so a lot of my theories, a lot of my analyses have proven to be, I think, correct.
[02:48:09.945 --> 02:48:25.200]  It's a little different because over the years I've had a lot of people say, hey, you know, I'm really interested in a lot of the philosophy that you talk about, a lot of the geopolitics that you talk about, a lot of the apologetic argumentation against atheism, against logical fallacies.
[02:48:25.980 --> 02:48:26.880]  What about that stuff?
[02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:40.745]  You know, Hollywood is fun, and that's neat to talk about that, and the movie symbolism, but maybe something, so people have asked for introductions to philosophy, introductions to analyzing literature and symbols and movies the way that I do that, and how do you do that?
[02:48:40.765 --> 02:48:41.545]  What's your approach?
[02:48:41.565 --> 02:48:42.125]  What's your pattern?
[02:48:42.145 --> 02:48:51.848]  Well, I decided to write a book on that, and so it's a very readable, I call it an educated person's introduction to philosophical thinking.
[02:48:52.288 --> 02:48:53.969]  So, it's not a philosophy textbook.
[02:48:54.089 --> 02:49:00.050]  It's not a boring, dry thing where you're going to have to try to, you know, memorize a bunch of stuff.
[02:49:00.090 --> 02:49:16.675]  It's more so, again, a readable introduction to philosophical thinking, to how to do critical thinking, to how to analyze works of literature or movies, because, you know, reading a book and decoding the symbolism is not much different than watching a movie and decoding the symbolism.
[02:49:16.696 --> 02:49:18.176]  It's just different mediums, right?
[02:49:18.835 --> 02:49:27.942]  So, it's called Meta-Narratives, and it's essays in philosophy and symbolism, and the final copy and all that's been, as I said, sent to the printer.
[02:49:27.982 --> 02:49:36.008]  And so, basically, we go through the first few chapters talking about what metaphysics is and why this has been discarded from philosophy and education.
[02:49:36.088 --> 02:49:39.151]  It's something that the ancient and medieval world were very fond of.
[02:49:39.891 --> 02:49:46.216]  And because of the predominance of atheism and materialism, metaphysics has pretty much been done away with, right?
[02:49:46.657 --> 02:49:52.101]  Soul, mind, abstract objects, God, angels, those things are all superstition.
[02:49:52.141 --> 02:49:53.102]  We've done away with all that.
[02:49:53.142 --> 02:49:56.264]  We're smart, rationalistic atheists now.
[02:49:56.304 --> 02:49:58.366]  We don't need any of that jibber-jabber.
[02:49:58.406 --> 02:49:59.547]  But is that really sensible?
[02:49:59.567 --> 02:50:03.430]  So I go through a heavy critique of the scientistic worldview.
[02:50:03.570 --> 02:50:06.933]  Not science, but scientism and the worldview of scientism.
[02:50:07.581 --> 02:50:20.175]  Uh, in the first few chapters, I go into explaining metaphysics, I go into ancient, famous texts of philosophy that are really insightful, that have kind of been suppressed in academia, like Plato's Timaeus, Plato's Phaedo.
[02:50:20.355 --> 02:50:25.601]  These are famous philosophical essays and dialogues that don't get a lot of coverage, even in academia.
[02:50:25.721 --> 02:50:26.001]  Why?
[02:50:26.282 --> 02:50:34.315]   In my view, because they point us to The transcendent, they point us to God, they point us to divine things beyond just the here and the now.
[02:50:34.855 --> 02:50:38.980]  So clearly, academia is not going to be that interested in that because they have an agenda.
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:56.721]   Academia is bought off and paid for and under the aegis of the same Globalist agenda right that we've been talking about for so long as all of the other areas of life So you're not going to get that great of a philosophical education unless you were like specialize in Plato Then you might go into these kinds of things, right?
[02:50:57.802 --> 02:51:12.252]   So I have essays where I go into that and kind of decoding and bringing out the the ancient archetypal symbols and patterns that we see in in the in the ancient Greek philosophy and from Plato and Aristotle, I go into heavy critiques
[02:51:12.252 --> 02:51:15.291]   of Darwinism and the materialist philosophy that's out there.
[02:51:15.291 --> 02:51:21.971]   And so I utilize quite a few philosophers from both Orthodox tradition, Catholic tradition as well,
[02:51:21.971 --> 02:51:26.492]   Protestants as well, they all kind of come into this work where I see good arguments that are there.
[02:51:26.492 --> 02:51:30.492]   So even though it's not an argument, it's not a book about proving God,
[02:51:30.492 --> 02:51:34.212]   it's more of a preparatory book on beginning to think in different ways.
[02:51:34.212 --> 02:51:40.601]   How do we alter our paradigm and think and look at the world in a different way to change our
[02:51:40.601 --> 02:51:41.092]  paradigm.
[02:51:41.486 --> 02:51:44.187]  I don't just automatically jump into arguing for God or anything like that.
[02:51:44.207 --> 02:51:49.888]  I mean, I do bring that up, but it's not primarily an apologetics book or a book about the transcendental argument for God.
[02:51:50.328 --> 02:51:53.629]  It's more of a preparatory book for how to start thinking in that way.
[02:51:53.649 --> 02:52:05.013]   And it does include some elements of, as I said, critiquing Darwinism, critiquing scientism, critiquing atheism, materialism, and those Prevalent things that are out there, especially empiricism.
[02:52:05.073 --> 02:52:06.694]  I've got several chapters critiquing that.
[02:52:06.854 --> 02:52:12.158]  There's a chapter critiquing David Hume, critiquing Kant, and then the Frankfurt School.
[02:52:12.799 --> 02:52:21.405]  There's critiques of Nietzsche as well, and a positive appraisal of people like Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard.
[02:52:21.805 --> 02:52:24.487]  So you might think, well, it's not anti all the philosophers.
[02:52:24.527 --> 02:52:27.069]  I bring out some of the good elements in Kierkegaard and Nietzsche.
[02:52:27.770 --> 02:52:30.692]  There's a really in-depth chapter on Dostoevsky.
[02:52:30.832 --> 02:52:39.493]   Like how would we find Uh, parallels and insights into human psychology, even in literature from somebody like Dostoevsky.
[02:52:40.093 --> 02:52:47.177]  I go into Egyptian philosophy and how they viewed the universe and its structure and what insights we might could even grow out of that.
[02:52:47.657 --> 02:52:52.660]  And then there's even a chapter on Machiavelli who wrote a book that not many people know about called Art of War.
[02:52:53.797 --> 02:52:55.378]  Not the same thing as Sun Tzu's Order of War.
[02:52:55.398 --> 02:52:55.999]  It's a different book.
[02:52:56.019 --> 02:53:07.507]  Everybody knows about Machiavelli's Prince, but not many people know he wrote another book about warfare, which actually was very important in terms of setting the stage for the revolution out of medieval warfare into modern warfare.
[02:53:08.068 --> 02:53:12.471]  And that's important to go into because one of the most famous books talks about false flags, right?
[02:53:12.491 --> 02:53:22.380]   So I try to bring in even the metaphysics or the higher level analysis of Geopolitics as well. It's not primarily a geopolitics book,
[02:53:22.380 --> 02:53:25.710]   but that's what it is You want to get pre-orders of that will be out in the next
[02:53:25.710 --> 02:53:27.351]   couple weeks You can go to my website
[02:53:27.351 --> 02:53:31.989]   the link is there at the top of the website for pre-orders all the copies from my website are signed and
[02:53:31.989 --> 02:53:37.149]   We're gonna be having a Nashville event. So if you live in the Nashville area go to my social medias
[02:53:37.149 --> 02:53:42.470]   I think around July 30th, maybe August 6 We're gonna have a an event
[02:53:42.324 --> 02:53:46.447]  It'll be a ticketed event and so look for the exact date I'll put it up.
[02:53:46.787 --> 02:53:48.428]  It'll be a speaking event be a lot of fun.
[02:53:48.468 --> 02:53:54.552]  You can come on out if you're in the Nashville area in about a month on a Saturday and I'll be talking about the book.
[02:53:54.632 --> 02:53:55.713]  I'll be acting silly.

[02:53:58.234 --> 02:54:00.035]  So hopefully it'll be a fun event.

[02:54:06.440 --> 02:54:07.460]  It'll be about a month out.
[02:54:07.279 --> 02:54:10.559]   So follow me on social medias if you want to come out to the speaking event.

[02:56:01.807 --> 02:56:05.567]   We gotta blow it out to fund the operation at infowarestore.com.
[02:56:05.567 --> 02:56:08.087]  And I wanna explain something here.
[02:56:08.087 --> 02:56:11.527]   With what's going on in the world, you wanna boost your immune system.
[02:56:11.527 --> 02:56:16.146]   And a lot of these products really, really do that, but they do a lot more amazing things as well.
[02:56:16.146 --> 02:56:19.006]  And here's something just as important.
[02:56:19.006 --> 02:56:22.646]   We have to sell these products to have funds to operate into the future,
[02:56:22.646 --> 02:56:27.247]   even though most of these products, we only have a few thousand bottles left of,
[02:56:27.247 --> 02:56:32.006]   and we're not even sure when we're gonna get more, But I'm in that catch-22 of where we've got to move it.
[02:56:32.012 --> 02:56:34.053]  So this could be the last time you ever get these products.
[02:56:34.433 --> 02:56:36.975]  We absolutely need the funding, and they're amazing products.
[02:56:37.075 --> 02:56:40.758]  A 360 win at infowarestore.com.
[02:56:41.118 --> 02:56:50.563]   It is the July 4th super sale blowout that is starting right now, and I have taken the donations, the Bitcoin donations and things, and put
[02:56:50.563 --> 02:56:55.371]   orders in on eight of our best-selling products that have been sold out because of supply chain
[02:56:55.371 --> 02:56:59.541]   breakdowns. And we got in a bind because the supply chain breakdowns didn't have funds from
[02:56:59.541 --> 02:57:00.721]  other products being sold.
[02:57:00.721 --> 02:57:04.403]   So we didn't have the money to even buy those popular products now that they're actually
[02:57:04.403 --> 02:57:09.582]  available again. Highest quality proprietary, but now we do.
[02:57:09.582 --> 02:57:14.751]   And so in one month, four of the products come back in, and in two months, the other four
[02:57:14.751 --> 02:57:15.682]  products come in.
[02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:16.460]  Hooray!
[02:57:16.660 --> 02:57:17.381]  Hallelujah!
[02:57:17.641 --> 02:57:18.601]  Thank you for that donor.
[02:57:19.061 --> 02:57:22.983]  So we can take that donation and then double it to stay on the air.
[02:57:23.043 --> 02:57:25.563]  So we're talking about the nick of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:25.984 --> 02:57:32.426]  We are like, just right there on the edge of oblivion, but God keeps coming through, through you.
