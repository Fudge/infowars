[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.800]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, "I don't know what's
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.240]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:14.467 --> 00:00:16.630]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:24.571]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:43.572]  [Music]
[00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:48.906]  China's cyber threat is greater than any other nation.
[00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:55.670]  China's hackers, their hacking program is greater than every other major country combined.
[00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:03.734]  The FBI director has come out and discovered a giant new threat that's blown him away!
[00:01:03.874 --> 00:01:12.638]  You came back to the government, you'd been in the Justice Department before, and when you came back as FBI director, were you surprised at the scale of Chinese spying?
[00:01:13.746 --> 00:01:14.907]  You know, it's a good question.
[00:01:14.947 --> 00:01:19.471]  I obviously had worked on a lot of this before when I was Assistant Attorney General.
[00:01:20.092 --> 00:01:29.420]  The counter-espionage section reported up to me, so I thought I knew a lot about the Chinese espionage campaign and theft campaign.
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.146]  But maybe more than any other threat I've seen since I've come back into government, back into law enforcement in this role, this one blew me away.
[00:01:38.217 --> 00:01:41.959]  And I'm not the kind of guy that uses words like blown away easily.
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:52.546]  Kind of like the FBI until the mid-1950s told Congress that La Cosa Nostra, an organized crime by the Italians, did not exist.
[00:01:53.387 --> 00:01:58.470]  Certain people may find out certain things which you might not want mentioned.
[00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.992]  I'm sorry you said that.
[00:02:01.932 --> 00:02:03.033]  I'm sorry it had to be said.
[00:02:03.513 --> 00:02:05.975]  Well now they tell us Chinese spies don't exist!
[00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.814]  Even though they basically took over Hollywood, took over the Democratic Party, put their operatives in as the managers of senators and members of the House.
[00:02:14.914 --> 00:02:21.897]  But now because George Soros said that China and the Communists are bad, because he's God.
[00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:26.700]  And Xi Jinping's guilty secret is bound to be revealed.
[00:02:27.486 --> 00:02:31.527]  Either during the Winter Olympics or soon thereafter.
[00:02:32.048 --> 00:02:47.073]  Now the FBI is allowed to admit it exists because Xi Jinping, for all of his evil and all of his corruption, has decided to not have forced abortion and has decided to tell people to have three children and has decided to be proud of being Chinese and not wanting to destroy his country.
[00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:53.099]   And so because he did that, and it's not giving George Soros, his sacrament of dead babies.
[00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:59.000]  Well now, George Soros' minion has come out and discovered the Chinese communist threat.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.981]  This is, it's like discovering the moon when, you know, you're 50 years old or something.
[00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:09.082]  You've said recently that the Chinese probably have the data of every American adult.
[00:03:09.382 --> 00:03:09.982]  They've stolen.
[00:03:10.622 --> 00:03:11.462]  Why should that matter?
[00:03:11.502 --> 00:03:14.183]  Why should I care if the Chinese have my personal data?
[00:03:15.148 --> 00:03:29.233]  Well, China's government is engaged in an effort to, both at home and abroad, to engage in monitoring, surveillance, espionage, and other kinds of targeting.
[00:03:29.513 --> 00:03:34.015]  And the information, the data that they steal, helps them advance those efforts.
[00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:42.919]  And so, you know, back in China, you might see that reflected in things like social credit scores and eavesdropping and other forms of oppression.
[00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:49.343]  But part of the problem is that they're exporting parts of that police state here in the United States.
[00:03:49.723 --> 00:03:52.705]  FBI director reveals the one threat to the U.S.
[00:03:52.745 --> 00:03:55.566]  that has blown him away.
[00:03:55.586 --> 00:04:04.231]  But wait a minute, he just said two years ago and a year ago that white supremacy is the most lethal threat in America, says the FBI director, Ann Biden.
[00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:11.415]  And we won't ignore what our intelligence agency has determined to be the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today.
[00:04:13.437 --> 00:04:14.919]  White supremacy is terrorism.
[00:04:16.013 --> 00:04:34.900]  And I will say that a majority of the domestic terrorism cases that we've investigated are motivated by some version of what you might call white supremacist violence, but it includes other things as well.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.342]  We hear all about the white supremacists, they're the number one threat.
[00:04:37.782 --> 00:04:43.086]  Not the Mexican drug cartels, not MS-13, not the communist Chinese, not radical Islam.
[00:04:43.526 --> 00:04:43.807]  No.
[00:04:44.407 --> 00:04:51.152]  White people are inherently evil, and white people are inherently bad, and being white is inherently a bad thing.
[00:04:51.172 --> 00:05:00.539]  You see that taught in the schools, taught everywhere by the Marxist-Leninist leftists, that are using that as their divide-and-conquer strategy.
[00:05:02.671 --> 00:05:06.394]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:11.078]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[00:05:11.158 --> 00:05:14.440]  And so many people are deficient in ionide.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.721]  It's not the soil anymore.
[00:05:16.362 --> 00:05:17.903]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[00:05:18.403 --> 00:05:28.869]   But when you get high-quality tri-ionide, all three of the healthy types together, It does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly, your immune system.

[00:05:42.711 --> 00:05:47.151]   takes about two weeks to kick in on average, you really need to experience X3.
[00:05:47.151 --> 00:05:50.031]   Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're gonna be reordering it.

[00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.691]  (upbeat music)
[00:06:05.691 --> 00:06:08.270]  (upbeat music)
[00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:19.110]  Info Wars.
[00:06:19.367 --> 00:06:20.987]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:28.670]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, February 6th.
[00:06:29.591 --> 00:06:35.313]  The year is 2022 and all hell is literally breaking loose around the world.
[00:06:35.913 --> 00:06:36.953]  So scrap yourselves in.
[00:06:36.973 --> 00:06:40.875]  I want to thank you all so much for joining us this evening.
[00:06:42.082 --> 00:06:44.263]  Let me just go through the news we're going to be covering here.
[00:06:44.283 --> 00:06:52.008]  I'm going to be hosting four hours tonight, not just the regular Sunday edition, Alex Jones, 4 to 6 p.m., that we've been doing for 16 years in this slot.
[00:06:52.728 --> 00:06:54.870]  20 plus years syndicated during the weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.430]  to 3 p.m.
[00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:55.850]  Central.
[00:06:56.291 --> 00:07:02.374]  But of course, we have Sunday Live that Owen Troyer usually hosts, but I wanted to host it tonight because I've got so much news to cover.
[00:07:02.634 --> 00:07:04.956]  So I'll be here 4 to 8 p.m.
[00:07:05.256 --> 00:07:07.657]  Central Standard Time, and I'll be back 11 a.m.
[00:07:07.938 --> 00:07:11.820]  Central tomorrow in this chair, Lord willing, because the times are so important.
[00:07:12.401 --> 00:07:12.681]  Okay.
[00:07:13.602 --> 00:07:27.795]  First off, you all know what happened Friday afternoon, or you should probably, and that is Bloomberg put out the headline that Russia had attacked Ukraine, and they had all their reporting ready for what then supposedly unfolded.
[00:07:28.856 --> 00:07:31.238]  They did this before the last two Iraq wars as well.
[00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:33.400]  This is all part of a sign-off.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.583]  I'll be getting more into it today.
[00:07:37.367 --> 00:07:43.952]  But the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said the new name for fake news should be Bloomberg.
[00:07:44.893 --> 00:07:53.559]  I absolutely agree and here's a shot of it with the headline top story Russia invades Ukraine.
[00:07:53.819 --> 00:07:57.642]  The truth is the West is run by total globalist criminals.
[00:07:57.902 --> 00:08:00.204]  They have destabilized Eastern Europe.
[00:08:00.324 --> 00:08:09.155]   They are moving massive amounts of High-tech, class-A weapons, anti-aircraft, anti-personnel, anti-tank weapons in.
[00:08:11.196 --> 00:08:21.924]  And they have started a proxy war with Russia as the midterm election October surprise come early for the puppet President Joe Biden.
[00:08:22.725 --> 00:08:29.590]  And so now they're not just going to blow up some third-world Muslim country that can't fight back as a political distraction.
[00:08:30.307 --> 00:08:38.112]  While they open the borders up to those very Muslims once they're pissed off at us, all part of the Galean dialectic of problem, reaction, solution, and the great reset-replacement migration.
[00:08:38.452 --> 00:08:38.692]  No!
[00:08:38.912 --> 00:08:43.815]  They're gonna attack the second most powerful nuclear power in the world on their own turf!
[00:08:44.115 --> 00:08:46.697]  What a wonderful, wonderful idea.
[00:08:47.217 --> 00:08:52.380]  Bloomberg had fake headline, Russia invades Ukraine on homepage for 30 minutes.
[00:08:53.141 --> 00:09:01.148]   They'll be drilling Bloomberg said they're getting ready for war, and that it was just an accident because they were preparing for war.
[00:09:01.588 --> 00:09:07.231]  We prepare headlines for many scenarios, and the headline, Russia Invades Ukraine, was inadvertently published around 4 p.m.
[00:09:07.271 --> 00:09:08.391]  today on our website.
[00:09:08.411 --> 00:09:09.372]  We deeply regret the error.
[00:09:09.672 --> 00:09:13.714]  That headline has been removed, and we are investigating the cause.
[00:09:15.215 --> 00:09:26.304]   You know, back when I was a little more naive in 2008, I got up one morning at about 630 in the morning, went in, got some coffee, turned on my Desktop, big screen computer.
[00:09:27.184 --> 00:09:35.748]  And there was the headline on Drudge and everywhere else that was coming from CNN that Russia had invaded Georgia.
[00:09:36.408 --> 00:09:38.869]  And I jumped the shower real quick, jumped the car, drove in.
[00:09:39.309 --> 00:09:51.791]   By the time I got to work at about nine o'clock Was checking foreign news channels, including German and others, and they were reporting, actually, well, the Russians got attacked on their border in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and then they came in.
[00:09:51.971 --> 00:09:53.933]  And that was all true, but it didn't matter.
[00:09:54.113 --> 00:09:57.556]  Our media said that Russia had attacked Georgia.
[00:09:58.757 --> 00:10:04.362]  So if you follow the past actions of the globalists, looks to me like they're getting ready to launch a larger war against the Russians.
[00:10:05.557 --> 00:10:17.379]  And try to take back some of the areas that the Russians took in 2014 on their border and of course their main pipeline and main Black Sea base there strategically in southern Ukraine.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:26.381]  And so if the Russians then dare defend themselves, the West is going to say, oh, it's a false flag.
[00:10:26.841 --> 00:10:31.942]  The Russians attacked themselves and we never really attacked them and started a war.
[00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:37.705]  And then they get the provocation they want with the Russians, that the West has been pushing so hard, but can blame them.
[00:10:38.026 --> 00:11:01.510]   Just like Gulf of Tonkin, 1964, to officially launch a larger conflict, a police action as they called it, in Vietnam, declassified 2004, that it was a staged operation by the Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, and they released that same year, because it was Many, many decades after that on the anniversary, 2004 back to 1964.
[00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.171]  I did the math, that's 40 years.
[00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:19.558]  And they said right there on record and released the tapes on C-SPAN of, and I say tapes because you can hear it loop whenever he's talking and then he'll have good audio and then bad audio because the tape's so old and warped.
[00:11:19.858 --> 00:11:26.541]  They were recording and LBJ is down at his Texas ranch outside Austin in Johnson City.
[00:11:27.908 --> 00:11:31.849]  And there he is telling McNamara, okay, what's going on?
[00:11:31.869 --> 00:11:35.131]  And McNamara gives him the orders and says, you'll hear the news in about five hours.
[00:11:35.151 --> 00:11:36.311]  We're going to say we were attacked.
[00:11:36.511 --> 00:11:39.232]  And then he tells him how to officially put the story out.
[00:11:39.332 --> 00:11:41.513]  So that's what they're getting ready for.
[00:11:41.533 --> 00:11:42.393]  That's what they're doing.
[00:11:42.733 --> 00:11:43.734]  It's incredibly dangerous.
[00:11:43.794 --> 00:11:44.594]  It's incredibly bad.
[00:11:45.954 --> 00:11:50.576]  And Tucker Carlson on Friday did a really great job of laying this all out.
[00:11:50.596 --> 00:12:24.320]   So I don't normally air his whole monologue, but we're going to do it today because Because he did such a great job laying out what happened in that huge fiasco on Thursday at the State Department, where the CIA operative, well-known for lying about everything you can imagine, including there's no way Kabul will fall and there's no way the Taliban will take it over, days before it happened, deer in the headlights or weasel in the spotlight or cockroach in the spotlight, the little globalist, anti-American, New World Order operative,
[00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:30.032]  So just take my word for it, it's true, they are going to stage a false flag.
[00:12:31.112 --> 00:12:32.793]  Complete with fake movie productions.
[00:12:34.434 --> 00:12:37.295]  Meaning anything Russians show, they're going to say is a fake production.
[00:12:37.555 --> 00:12:48.499]  When it was the White Helmets and the Blue Helmets, and the UN got caught, along with a bunch of the Islamics, in Syria staging chemical attacks on Assad, which later came out, were staged, and were fake.
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:57.335]   And the little boy that was supposedly dying from the nerve gas, he went on TV and said it was all fake and they paid his dad to have him do it.
[00:12:58.316 --> 00:13:01.879]  Remember the kids are doing this and they may stop and look and say, do I keep going?
[00:13:01.899 --> 00:13:02.860]  They go, yeah.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.423]  I mean, all of that, ladies and gentlemen, is what the globalists do.
[00:13:06.783 --> 00:13:08.285]  Could the Russians stage a false flag?
[00:13:08.425 --> 00:13:08.945]  Absolutely.
[00:13:08.965 --> 00:13:15.411]  I'm not saying they're perfect, but the New World Order is the big, aggressive, dominant thing that's on the Russian border.
[00:13:15.931 --> 00:13:17.653]  Here's some of what Tucker had to say Friday night.
[00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:27.642]  We'll play just one more portion of this exchange in which Matt Lee flips the usual script and accuses Ned Price of sounding like a crazed conspiracy nut.
[00:13:28.442 --> 00:13:29.042]  It's beautiful.
[00:13:29.363 --> 00:13:29.623]  Watch.
[00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:34.785]  What is the evidence that they... I mean, this is like crisis actors, really?
[00:13:34.825 --> 00:13:37.606]  This is like Alex Jones territory you're getting into now.
[00:13:39.107 --> 00:13:44.910]  What evidence do you have to support the idea that there is some propaganda film in the making?
[00:13:46.127 --> 00:13:49.090]  Matt, this is derived from information known to the U.S.
[00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.471]  government.
[00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:52.113]  Intelligence information that we have declassified.
[00:13:52.434 --> 00:13:53.094]  I think you know.
[00:13:53.174 --> 00:13:54.356]  Okay, well, where is it?
[00:13:54.476 --> 00:13:55.797]  Where is this information?
[00:13:56.318 --> 00:13:58.660]  It is intelligence information that we have declassified.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:13:59.241]  Well, where is it?
[00:13:59.321 --> 00:14:00.822]  Where is the declassified information?
[00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:02.384]  I just delivered it.
[00:14:03.945 --> 00:14:06.128]  No, you made a series of allegations.
[00:14:09.139 --> 00:14:09.840]  One correction.
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:14.763]  Alex Jones lies far less and is far more credible than Ned Price is.
[00:14:15.364 --> 00:14:16.144]  But you see the point.
[00:14:16.304 --> 00:14:17.685]  Ned Price lost that exchange.
[00:14:17.725 --> 00:14:22.649]  He claimed to have information that he did not have and Matt Lee persistently called him out on it.
[00:14:22.689 --> 00:14:24.370]  So Ned Price just ran out of BS.
[00:14:25.111 --> 00:14:26.232]  The BS barrel was empty.
[00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:28.167]  So what did he do then?
[00:14:28.987 --> 00:14:30.148]  What did Ned Price do then?
[00:14:30.188 --> 00:14:30.948]  You know the answer.
[00:14:31.388 --> 00:14:34.348]  Ned Price did what they all do when they're cornered.
[00:14:34.729 --> 00:14:37.449]  He went right to the lowest personal attack.
[00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:39.510]  He didn't call Matt Lee racist.
[00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.110]  He's probably saving that for next week.
[00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.951]  But he did suggest that Matt Lee is more sympathetic to Russia than he is to his own country, the United States.
[00:14:46.991 --> 00:14:50.072]  He implied that Matt Lee is a shill for Vladimir Putin.
[00:14:50.432 --> 00:14:50.692]  Watch.
[00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:54.635]  If you doubt the credibility of the U.S.
[00:14:54.675 --> 00:15:04.945]  government, of the British government, of other governments, and want to find solace in information that the Russians are putting out, that is for you to do.
[00:15:05.105 --> 00:15:07.587]  I'm not asking what the Russian government is putting out.
[00:15:08.008 --> 00:15:09.309]  What is it supposed to mean?
[00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:18.565]   So if you're on Russia's side, Now in an earlier age, this is the point where Matt Lee would have vaulted the podium and punched Ned Price right in the face.
[00:15:19.005 --> 00:15:23.691]  There was a time in this country when calling a man disloyal was a grave and serious charge.
[00:15:23.711 --> 00:15:25.032]  You could not let that stand.
[00:15:25.833 --> 00:15:26.734]  That's not true anymore.
[00:15:26.774 --> 00:15:27.756]  We're so used to it now.
[00:15:28.196 --> 00:15:29.297]  We hear it constantly.
[00:15:30.476 --> 00:15:38.437]  And Tucker Carlson, in the full report that will air coming up later in this hour, or if not, we don't have time when I host the third and fourth hour, you gotta go watch it.
[00:15:38.457 --> 00:15:39.578]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:44.779]  He announces that he's now under CIA investigation, which is illegal in the U.S.
[00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:46.099]  to have the CIA doing that.
[00:15:46.119 --> 00:15:48.939]  I remember last year he broke the NSA was spying on him illegally.
[00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:51.100]  The media denied it, but later it turned out it was true.
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:57.601]  So that's the country we live in, ladies and gentlemen, where the deep state thinks it owns all of us, like we're in North Korea.
[00:15:57.841 --> 00:15:58.241]  Stay with us.
[00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:07.954]  In my 28 years on air, Reset Wars is the most important information I have ever put out.
[00:16:08.814 --> 00:16:23.743]  And since we released it in the middle of December 2021, about a month and a half ago, there has been debanking, there has been blocking of the video streams, there has been attacks on the email servers, there has been unprecedented attempts to shut this down.
[00:16:24.503 --> 00:16:29.645]  And as much of a pain in the neck that is, and as much as I don't like it, it lets me know I'm over the target.
[00:16:29.665 --> 00:16:38.269]  The old World War II saying, when the bombers knew they were over the German troops or the German factories, or the Allied factories, was because that's where they were getting the flack.
[00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:40.950]  That's where the anti-aircraft guns were shooting at them.
[00:16:41.758 --> 00:16:45.221]  And so my mission is to steer into the flack and take on the globalists.
[00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:47.743]  And they are so afraid of recent wars.
[00:16:47.803 --> 00:17:04.819]  And because of their censorship, and because of the fact they're scared of this getting to the general public, this mind-spirit technology, to just be aware of the globalists and how they operate and their tricks, and to be aware of the fact that the universe is much larger and that God's there literally reaching out to you through free will.
[00:17:06.311 --> 00:17:10.276]  They are doing everything they can to block this information.
[00:17:10.696 --> 00:17:20.028]  So because of all their attempts to censor it and block it, we're offering it at 50% off for the first time and probably the only time ever.

[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.321]  They want you depressed.
[00:17:29.341 --> 00:17:31.781]  They want you to feel like you're trapped in your five senses.
[00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:36.202]  They don't want you to know about the sixth sense, or what a lot of the ancients called the third eye.
[00:17:36.942 --> 00:17:37.422]  It's there.
[00:17:37.923 --> 00:17:38.443]  It's real.
[00:17:38.783 --> 00:17:48.985]  And this only gets you to focus with exercises and research and history and prayer to reconnect with the sixth sense, which is the conduit to the divine and God.
[00:17:49.545 --> 00:17:52.027]  Ladies and gentlemen, they do not want you to have Reset Wars.

[00:18:11.538 --> 00:18:17.600]  With the deep state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe, and war with Russia.

[00:20:02.658 --> 00:20:08.497]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones
[00:20:08.497 --> 00:20:28.017]   People are really waking up fast [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:20:27.610 --> 00:20:29.291]  The mask is coming off.
[00:20:31.072 --> 00:20:45.380]  Just a few days ago, on Thursday, Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House, got up on TV and said, do not protest, do not speak out, do not criticize anything when you're in China, or you'll get disappeared like this Dutch reporter.
[00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.560]  TV viewers can see this.
[00:20:47.181 --> 00:20:49.342]  The video is posted up on InfoWars.com.
[00:20:50.174 --> 00:21:01.180]  Dutch reporter hauled off by CCP officials during Olympics live report because they didn't like what he had to say.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:16.709]  You see the red armband of the thought police that he was taken away to a police facility reportedly will be deported if he's lucky as they disappear him.
[00:21:17.515 --> 00:21:18.256]  So there you go.
[00:21:18.496 --> 00:21:25.880]  And so Pelosi told folks, he said, I would say to our athletes, you're there to compete.
[00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:30.863]  Do not risk incurring the anger of the Chinese government because they are ruthless.
[00:21:30.883 --> 00:21:36.226]  Pelosi said, I know there is a temptation on the part of some to speak out while they're there.
[00:21:36.907 --> 00:21:37.547]  I respect that.
[00:21:38.488 --> 00:21:41.830]  And she goes, but, and then she goes on to say, they don't care what you say.
[00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:43.671]  You know, here's the issue.
[00:21:45.698 --> 00:21:49.781]  Communist China is a competing tyranny to the globalists that have hijacked America.
[00:21:50.741 --> 00:21:54.924]  And they're a competing power structure to the European Union and the Russians.
[00:21:55.424 --> 00:21:57.585]  Those are the major power structures that are governmental.
[00:21:58.326 --> 00:22:01.268]  There's the United States and the Anglo-American Corporate Combine.
[00:22:01.288 --> 00:22:03.409]  That's what they call themselves.
[00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:07.372]  There is the EU that's partially outlawed with that.
[00:22:08.292 --> 00:22:11.094]  There is the Communist Chinese and there is the Russians.
[00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:14.352]  Now, above that is the Demos Group and the U.N.
[00:22:14.612 --> 00:22:17.474]  and the multinational corporations that form the New World Order.
[00:22:18.255 --> 00:22:23.238]  And they are in full control of the Anglo-American establishment, a military arm.
[00:22:23.298 --> 00:22:24.139]  That is, the U.K.
[00:22:24.419 --> 00:22:25.079]  and the U.S.
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.540]  and the Commonwealth nations.
[00:22:28.001 --> 00:22:29.643]  And so, that's why you see the U.S.
[00:22:29.683 --> 00:22:31.964]  as a quasi-Commonwealth nation now.
[00:22:32.324 --> 00:22:44.975]   On every channel, they celebrated the Queen's 70th year of reign today, and how magnificent it is, and how wondrous That didn't start until the 20s when British intelligence began infiltrating and taking over the U.S.
[00:22:45.015 --> 00:22:45.335]  government.
[00:22:45.615 --> 00:22:47.036]  By the way, they've all written books on it.
[00:22:47.076 --> 00:22:49.418]  It's not denied at Ph.D.
[00:22:49.458 --> 00:22:51.720]  level classes at Georgetown.
[00:22:52.361 --> 00:23:03.550]  They teach you at Harvard and Georgetown and the Foreign Service that you are in the Queen's service and a global government that they know best and you're a Kingsman and all of this and it has nothing to do with the Brits.
[00:23:03.650 --> 00:23:07.694]  It's that combine of the British East India Company and the rest of it.
[00:23:09.272 --> 00:23:14.917]  That's the global government system of corporate rule is the British and Dutch East India Companies.
[00:23:14.937 --> 00:23:16.118]  That's what this all comes out of.
[00:23:18.661 --> 00:23:29.271]  And so that's why you're told George Washington is bad, and Thomas Jefferson is evil, and Teddy Roosevelt is bad, but God save our Queen!
[00:23:30.632 --> 00:23:33.915]  And Pelosi says you need to shut your mouth.
[00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.694]  If you're an American over there, meanwhile, they're censoring people here.
[00:23:37.994 --> 00:23:42.541]  We have the spectacle of the press secretary saying she basically wants Joe Rogan shut down.
[00:23:43.996 --> 00:24:02.239]  And they have legislation now, they're trying to pass, that's heavily sponsored, may pass in the House, to start funding mainstream corporate media and certify that only it is allowed to be on social media, where everyone else who isn't certified can't even have a chance to have someone share your article.
[00:24:02.559 --> 00:24:11.401]  And if you violate the certification by creating a futurenews.news or a resetwars.com, well that's criminal!
[00:24:13.428 --> 00:24:19.414]  Including for, I mean folks, this is North Korea level stuff.
[00:24:19.454 --> 00:24:22.998]  So while they criticize China, which they should, they don't say a word about us.
[00:24:23.018 --> 00:24:25.720]  But you see, China was set up by the globalists.
[00:24:26.882 --> 00:24:28.803]  China was set up by the New World Order.
[00:24:29.845 --> 00:24:32.247]  China was set up by this entire system.
[00:24:32.527 --> 00:24:35.090]  And now what did Xi Jinping start doing the last five years?
[00:24:35.854 --> 00:24:41.258]  He said, no, I'm gonna have a big military too, not just control the world's raw materials and resources.
[00:24:41.298 --> 00:24:42.159]  That's the deal they've made.
[00:24:42.479 --> 00:24:46.542]  China will do all the manufacturing, control the world that way, but the West will have the military.
[00:24:46.822 --> 00:24:52.086]  China, of course, double-crossed and followed that, and is now trying to take over the United States with their spies and operatives.
[00:24:53.246 --> 00:24:58.170]  And now the FBI that said there weren't any Chinese spies is like panicking, saying, oh my God, they're everywhere, they're taking over!
[00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:59.231]  Good Lord, help us!
[00:25:00.031 --> 00:25:11.758]  Because they were so busy trying to crush America, and take our guns, and dumb us down, and cut our son's penises off, literally, as their sacrament of Satanism, that now the Chi-Coms have double-crossed them, and own Hollywood and everything else.
[00:25:12.779 --> 00:25:14.399]  And are rolling up the Democrats as spies.
[00:25:16.381 --> 00:25:21.604]  So suddenly, all these Chi-Com agents are suddenly saying China's a threat, but only because they're in trouble.
[00:25:24.025 --> 00:25:27.087]  So, that's where all this is going.
[00:25:28.508 --> 00:25:37.673]   And, Just like Hitler made deals with Stalin, and Hitler then double-crossed Stalin, it's the same thing going on here.
[00:25:38.973 --> 00:25:44.655]  One criminal group's made a deal with another criminal group, and now that it's time to cut up the loot, they're trying to kill each other.
[00:25:45.616 --> 00:25:54.759]  There's no honor among thieves, as it has been said for thousands of years, because it's a law of the universe, a law of the world, and it's what's going on.
[00:25:55.059 --> 00:26:07.345]   So all of the China-phile, China-worship by the Democratic Party, And by the Washington Post, and by all the rest of it, how Xi Jinping's gonna save us, and Xi Jinping's gonna crush Trump.
[00:26:07.725 --> 00:26:10.127]  Remember that big headline in the Washington Post?
[00:26:10.828 --> 00:26:12.489]  Suddenly, like, just flip a switch.
[00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.412]  Just like, he was Uncle Joe Stalin.
[00:26:15.432 --> 00:26:16.853]  He was the best guy for America.
[00:26:17.173 --> 00:26:18.034]  He was a reformer.
[00:26:18.074 --> 00:26:19.155]  He was a humanitarian.
[00:26:19.515 --> 00:26:21.797]  New York Times, Washington Post, Time Magazine.
[00:26:22.098 --> 00:26:23.519]  Joe Stalin is the man.
[00:26:23.559 --> 00:26:24.940]  If he can't do it, nobody can.
[00:26:25.441 --> 00:26:38.737]   And as soon as World War II ended, And as soon as Churchill gave his Iron Curtain speech, and as soon as that began, suddenly he was the biggest devil the world had ever seen.
[00:26:38.777 --> 00:26:41.638]  And by the way, he was pretty bad by every yardstick.
[00:26:42.258 --> 00:27:05.065]   But the point is, is that you have these power structures fighting with each other, and these big multinational corporations that want to dissolve the nation states, and want to only have a world UN army, Trying to balance all of that and get full control and engineering the virus release and lockdowns and the tyranny as an attempt to give their corporations and systems more control.
[00:27:06.446 --> 00:27:12.492]  But now it's already starting to unravel incredibly quickly.
[00:27:14.393 --> 00:27:30.055]   So when we come back, we're going to lay out more of what's really going on geopolitically and why Biden Is trying to start a war or a proxy war that's already going on with Russia and what we can expect with 275 days from the election.
[00:27:30.535 --> 00:27:34.216]  But what have I been saying year after year, month after month, day after day?
[00:27:35.957 --> 00:27:38.518]  Cyber attacks, the globalist launch, they'll blame on foreign powers.
[00:27:39.518 --> 00:27:45.380]  Because they stand to gain from staying in power as posing as our protectors when they have all the motives and history of actually running the attacks.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:51.047]   Economic implosions, wars, imploding borders, Inflation.
[00:27:51.668 --> 00:27:54.089]  The globalists are waging war against the populations.
[00:27:54.109 --> 00:27:59.071]  They want to suck dry and make poor so they can control us and depopulate us under a medical tyranny takeover.
[00:27:59.491 --> 00:28:08.255]  Just like Hitler was busy trying to kill all these indigenous populations he didn't like while he was fighting the Russians and the Allies and all the rest of it.
[00:28:08.275 --> 00:28:15.598]  And it's the same globalist strain that created Hitler has now created Klaus Schwab and the Bilderberg Group and the New World Order.
[00:28:15.858 --> 00:28:17.019]  So they want a medical tyranny.
[00:28:17.039 --> 00:28:19.720]  They want to slowly suck us dry, bankrupt us and kill us.
[00:28:21.391 --> 00:28:24.636]  Because their main religion is killing people through medical tyranny.
[00:28:24.756 --> 00:28:26.378]  It's the sick thing they're into.
[00:28:26.639 --> 00:28:28.081]  It's how they get their kicks.
[00:28:28.141 --> 00:28:28.742]  It's their fetish.
[00:28:30.091 --> 00:28:42.493]  While they try to dominate the big commie power structure they put in China to feed off them, and the same Anglo-American establishment put the Bolsheviks in under Lenin, but Stalin double-crossed Lenin and kicked him out, along with Trotsky.
[00:28:42.693 --> 00:28:44.393]  Well, killed Lenin, kicked out Trotsky.
[00:28:44.754 --> 00:28:49.254]  And so the globals are like, we control you, we control you, we control you, we hate our own people too!
[00:28:49.274 --> 00:28:55.675]  They're trying to kill the Russians, kill the Chinese, kill the Americans, kill the patriots, kill the babies, kill the children, cut the boys' penises off in America!
[00:28:56.035 --> 00:28:58.736]  That's their whole mission, is kill, kill, kill, murder everybody.
[00:29:00.757 --> 00:29:05.800]  I really regret it when I forget to take high quality iodine supplements.
[00:29:06.841 --> 00:29:07.982]  It is the good halogen.
[00:29:08.182 --> 00:29:16.368]  The UN admits 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities on the face of the earth today.
[00:29:17.548 --> 00:29:22.812]  That's over 20% because they have had iodine deficiencies.
[00:29:23.733 --> 00:29:25.754]  Now we've got two different great iodine products.
[00:29:25.774 --> 00:29:26.534]  We've got X2.
[00:29:26.615 --> 00:29:27.175]  It's amazing.
[00:29:27.935 --> 00:29:30.297]  Pure Deep Earth Crystal Atomic Iodine.
[00:29:30.777 --> 00:29:32.019]  And it's been sold out for a while.
[00:29:32.439 --> 00:29:42.768]  We finally got X3 back in, that is the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, and then two other types, because some studies show it helps with the absorption of the pure iodine.
[00:29:43.028 --> 00:29:43.989]  So it's apples and oranges.
[00:29:44.629 --> 00:29:45.730]  Both formulas are excellent.
[00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.253]  People constantly ask me, including on the street, what's better, X2 or X3?
[00:29:50.894 --> 00:29:51.555]  Apples and oranges.
[00:29:51.635 --> 00:29:56.318]  It's like, do you like iceberg lettuce or do you like spinach?
[00:29:56.338 --> 00:29:58.560]  I mean, it's two different things.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.602]  It's like a tomato versus a potato.
[00:30:02.643 --> 00:30:05.185]  Bottom line, your body needs iodine.
[00:30:05.823 --> 00:30:10.423]  And the globalists are bombarding all of us with bad halogens.
[00:30:10.423 --> 00:30:13.223]  Fluoride, bromine, chloride.
[00:30:13.223 --> 00:30:18.463]   All of those systems that block fertility, block our electrochemical cells, block our
[00:30:18.463 --> 00:30:19.463]  immune system.
[00:30:19.463 --> 00:30:24.862]   So just on the immune system front, so many people have deficiencies in iodine.
[00:30:24.862 --> 00:30:31.583]   So X3 is back in stock for being sold out for four months at 50% off.
[00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:36.852]  So for your libido, your stamina, your energy, everything, try X3 today.

[00:31:06.864 --> 00:31:11.786]  I mean, believe me, of all the things that InfoWars has predicted that have come true, I hope this is the one that never comes true.
[00:31:11.826 --> 00:31:16.228]  But, I mean, there could be a day where, you know, you're tuning in to go to InfoWars, and it's just gone.
[00:31:16.388 --> 00:31:16.868]  It's not there.
[00:31:16.968 --> 00:31:17.708]  You won't find Alex.
[00:31:17.748 --> 00:31:18.548]  You won't find Owen Schroeder.
[00:31:18.568 --> 00:31:19.489]  You won't find Harrison Smith.
[00:31:19.989 --> 00:31:20.910]  Won't find the great crew.
[00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:23.872]  And, uh, you know, you may never even know why.
[00:31:23.912 --> 00:31:25.073]  It's gone!
[00:31:25.193 --> 00:31:25.593]  It's gone.
[00:31:26.013 --> 00:31:28.135]  Kind of like disappeared, like happens in Thomas, China.
[00:31:28.395 --> 00:31:29.776]  So that's why you're tuned in.
[00:31:30.036 --> 00:31:43.645]   And the truth is, the more support we have, and the bigger audience we have, and you shopping at the store and telling your friends and family about the transmissions, That's like our single hedge of protection.
[00:31:43.686 --> 00:31:45.587]  That's like our fortress on a spaceship.
[00:31:46.227 --> 00:31:49.269]  That's like the battle shield on the spaceship is you.
[00:31:49.309 --> 00:31:50.170]  You're our battle shield.
[00:31:50.250 --> 00:31:51.591]  You're what protects us.
[00:31:51.831 --> 00:31:58.195]  So yes, you funding us and you telling your friends and family so that we can continue to increase our audience size, because yes, that's important.
[00:31:58.475 --> 00:32:01.337]  The bigger we are, the bigger a story it is when they take us down.
[00:32:01.517 --> 00:32:02.878]  Yeah, that's a big deal.
[00:32:03.219 --> 00:32:05.020]  You're going to strike down Obi-Wan Kenobi?
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.841]  Yeah, the whole universe is going to feel the force of that.
[00:32:07.161 --> 00:32:08.342]  You like what we do here?

[00:32:20.006 --> 00:32:21.647]  I mean, this is the most obvious thing.
[00:32:21.767 --> 00:32:27.809]  Alright, maybe you don't like supplements, you don't want a water filter, you don't want an air filter, you like drinking the dirty water and breathing the dirty air.
[00:32:28.129 --> 00:32:31.690]  You don't want emergency food supplies, you don't want to have emergency food in case everything goes to hell.
[00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.570]  Okay, fine!
[00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:32.950]  You know what?
[00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:34.091]  Do your brush your teeth.
[00:32:34.751 --> 00:32:36.811]  Why not get the toothpaste from the good guys?
[00:32:37.011 --> 00:32:38.552]  Go get ten tubes of it right now.
[00:32:38.752 --> 00:32:39.672]  Give it away as gifts.
[00:32:39.712 --> 00:32:40.313]  Just give it away.
[00:32:40.333 --> 00:32:41.493]  Say, hey, this is a great toothpaste.
[00:32:41.513 --> 00:32:41.933]  Try it out.
[00:32:42.333 --> 00:32:43.414]  Oh, hey, I like that toothpaste.
[00:32:43.454 --> 00:32:43.914]  Where'd you get it?
[00:32:43.974 --> 00:32:44.894]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:32:44.914 --> 00:32:45.234]  Check it out.
[00:32:45.314 --> 00:32:45.995]  Okay, I will.
[00:32:46.214 --> 00:32:52.774]   That's our survival right there is you shopping at Infowarsstore.com and you telling friends and family and strangers
[00:32:52.774 --> 00:33:08.694]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones
[00:33:08.694 --> 00:33:15.093]  [Music]
[00:33:15.133 --> 00:33:20.377]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:20.317 --> 00:33:27.317]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.317 --> 00:33:44.317]   Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live on this February 6th Sunday.
[00:33:44.913 --> 00:33:46.114]  Worldwide transmission.
[00:33:46.714 --> 00:33:49.136]  Remember, the signal gets boosted and we reach more people.
[00:33:49.777 --> 00:33:51.117]  We're able to take on the globalist.
[00:33:51.978 --> 00:34:13.046]   When you take the live feeds from futurenews.news, from infowars.com forward slash show, or from local radio stations that you're listening to on the AM or FM dial, and share their station feed that has my show Transmitted on as well, and that's how we reach new people in this information war.
[00:34:13.527 --> 00:34:50.954]   Again, the entire New World Order program is about suppression of information when they make their big biomedical tyranny takeover move that is in Operation Dark Winter, that is in Operation Lockstep, that is in Operation Event 201, and many others, down to the finest details of how they would create the virus, release the virus, And then train us to live in fear and then forcibly inject us with a gene therapy that erases our immune system and then give us a world ID through the vaccine passport via the phones to track and trace everywhere we go and control what we do.
[00:34:52.655 --> 00:35:17.105]   And coming up today, I'm going to host right through to 8 o'clock tonight and I'm going to air some incredible excerpts from a very important event taking place in Germany Right now, where they are having an international criminal court hearing with top judges, lawyers, scientists, and others, and they have handed down the findings of recommended indictments.
[00:35:20.006 --> 00:35:33.309]  Now, one of the things that the Pentagon, going back to the 1940s when it said it was in the business of freedom, said is important to do is to first have people's courts.
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:37.001]  But with prestigious people.
[00:35:37.041 --> 00:35:38.542]  That's what the Declaration of Independence was.
[00:35:40.583 --> 00:35:41.804]  The Continental Congress.
[00:35:43.345 --> 00:35:49.188]  And then you put the evidence on, so the public sees it, and that day the newspapers should come and write about it.
[00:35:49.909 --> 00:35:52.110]  The public will then debate about it, decide what they want to do.
[00:35:53.571 --> 00:36:01.436]  Committees of correspondence grew in to the Continental Congress on July 4th, and the rest is history.
[00:36:02.536 --> 00:36:13.488]   And if you go into the Pentagon's 198 ways, For civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance, one of the main ones is mock trials and mock juries.
[00:36:15.629 --> 00:36:18.769]  Now, this is a very prestigious one that just took place in Germany.
[00:36:19.029 --> 00:36:20.250]  There's hours and hours of it.
[00:36:21.070 --> 00:36:27.731]  I've got a few excerpts, 30 minutes or so, that will air in the fourth hour tonight.
[00:36:28.231 --> 00:36:36.993]  We also have a big article on InfoWars.com with some of the key quotes and links and videos there that I suggest you go and you get.
[00:36:38.422 --> 00:36:45.304]  Now, it's not just mock grand jury investigations going on, or international criminal courts going on with Nuremberg, too.
[00:36:47.304 --> 00:36:49.764]  Here's some of the big articles, Business Insider and others.
[00:36:49.885 --> 00:36:54.486]  Rand Paul, Senator, says Republicans will investigate Fauci if they retake the Senate.
[00:36:55.086 --> 00:36:57.966]  Escalating a long-running personal feud, says Business Insider.
[00:36:58.466 --> 00:36:59.687]  No, he lied about gain of function.
[00:36:59.727 --> 00:37:00.507]  He ran the program.
[00:37:00.747 --> 00:37:01.687]  He said weaponize it.
[00:37:01.867 --> 00:37:03.187]  He created COVID-19 on record.
[00:37:03.407 --> 00:37:05.688]  He deserves to go to prison for the rest of his life, bare minimum.
[00:37:07.597 --> 00:37:09.919]  Paul promises investigation of Fauci, Republicans take Senate.
[00:37:09.939 --> 00:37:11.660]  You're like, well, promises, promises.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:13.741]  Oh, but guess what?
[00:37:15.562 --> 00:37:23.808]  Congress has now started an investigation into Fauci and gain of function.
[00:37:24.798 --> 00:37:26.059]  So that's very, very important.
[00:37:26.079 --> 00:37:29.460]  And as this happens, because you can see all these articles, I go through them, I mix them up.
[00:37:29.881 --> 00:37:40.526]  Guys, I had the article in my stack where Congress announces and the committee announces, even though Democrats are in control, an investigation of the Wuhan virus origin and Fauci gain of function.
[00:37:40.546 --> 00:37:42.027]  That was the biggest story today.
[00:37:42.948 --> 00:37:47.770]  And for some reason, I just got it mixed into my stack and cannot, cannot find it.
[00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:49.271]  But it was here.
[00:37:51.472 --> 00:37:55.975]   And so I'm asking you guys, Uh, to find that for me ASAP.
[00:37:56.815 --> 00:37:57.876]  Working on it, thank you very much.
[00:37:58.877 --> 00:38:00.518]  Uh, but that's a big deal right there.
[00:38:00.538 --> 00:38:12.727]  So you've got Paul doing this, and then we've also got a new criminal investigation started by Parliament in the UK, and so some good things are happening, some amazing things are happening, and we're closing in on these criminals.
[00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:17.071]  So Rand Paul comes out and says they're going to launch a criminal investigation.
[00:38:17.591 --> 00:38:21.034]  British scientist Sir Jeremy Farr faces U.S.
[00:38:21.094 --> 00:38:21.934]  Congress probe.
[00:38:21.974 --> 00:38:24.896]  Oh, here's another one, too, over COVID cover-up concerns.
[00:38:24.916 --> 00:38:29.319]  Daily Mail, one of Britain's top scientists, is to be interviewed under oath by the U.S.
[00:38:29.359 --> 00:38:33.781]  Congress over concerns that he wasn't the center of a cover-up about the origins of COVID-19.
[00:38:34.302 --> 00:38:37.804]  He's in the emails with Fauci and Daszak saying they're going to cover it up.
[00:38:39.090 --> 00:38:40.191]  Through the medical journals.
[00:38:41.131 --> 00:38:50.297]  Sir Jeremy Farr was among a group of scientists who initially claimed the coronavirus could have been man-made in a lab in the Chinese city of Wuhan where the pandemic began.
[00:38:50.577 --> 00:38:51.617]  But after discussions with U.S.
[00:38:51.677 --> 00:38:56.100]  officials and other leading scientists in February of 2020, he changed his position.
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:39:00.483]  So they're going after the lowest level and moving up towards the top of the pyramid of criminals.
[00:39:00.843 --> 00:39:02.464]  That would be Bill Gates and the New World Order.
[00:39:03.845 --> 00:39:06.686]  So there is one of those congressional investigations going on right there.
[00:39:08.217 --> 00:39:09.238]  And then here's what I was mentioning.
[00:39:09.258 --> 00:39:10.098]  I want to play a clip of this.
[00:39:10.239 --> 00:39:10.719]  Clip one.
[00:39:11.199 --> 00:39:14.342]  International criminal grand jury investigation.
[00:39:17.064 --> 00:39:21.307]  Psychopathic global issues COVID to commit crimes against humanity.
[00:39:21.687 --> 00:39:37.968]   And these are current judges, former judges, top lawyers, top scientists, a who's who at this international coalition of lawyers and judges convened a hearing to prosecute the crimes against humanity perpetrated by governments Who used COVID-19 as the pretext.
[00:39:38.449 --> 00:39:39.189]  Great reset.
[00:39:39.269 --> 00:39:39.950]  New world order.
[00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.791]  All the documents.
[00:39:41.231 --> 00:39:41.832]  How they did it.
[00:39:42.012 --> 00:39:42.793]  It is incredible.
[00:39:42.993 --> 00:39:49.499]  And they said this is a blueprint for grand juries to indict in Europe and the UK and the US and Canada and their areas.
[00:39:49.839 --> 00:39:54.804]  And a blueprint for governments and other magistrates to begin criminal prosecutions.
[00:39:55.344 --> 00:40:01.450]  Here is a short clip of US-German attorney Dr. Rainer Fulmich.
[00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:02.370]  Three.
[00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:06.289]  gives statements at the International Criminal Grand Jury.
[00:40:06.289 --> 00:40:07.530]  Here's clip one.
[00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:10.088]  Our governments are not our governments anymore.
[00:40:10.088 --> 00:40:13.849]   Rather, they have been taken over by the World Economic Forum.
[00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:18.608]   Three, the same people who made the swine flu, which ultimately
[00:40:18.608 --> 00:40:26.889]   turned out to be a mild flu, into a pandemic 12 years ago by first changing the definition of what a pandemic is
[00:40:26.889 --> 00:40:31.329]  and then creating panic created this corona pandemic.
[00:40:31.329 --> 00:40:35.969]   The swine flu was their first real attempt at creating a pandemic.
[00:40:36.188 --> 00:40:55.299]  And just as one of its purposes then was to divert our attention from the blatantly fraudulent activities of their financial industry, more aptly to be called a financial mafia, which had become visible through the Lehman crisis, this is also one of their major purposes of this corona pandemic now.
[00:40:56.303 --> 00:41:14.827]  Had we taken a closer look then, during the Lehman crisis, instead of blindly believing our government's promises that the perpetrators of those financial crimes will be held liable, we would have seen then that they had been looting and plundering our public coffers for decades.
[00:41:15.467 --> 00:41:19.488]  And we would have seen that our governments are not our governments anymore.
[00:41:19.708 --> 00:41:32.170]   Rather, they have been taken over by the other side through their main platform, the World Economic Forum, Which had started to create their own global leaders through their Young Global Leaders program as early as 1992.
[00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:36.771]  Two of the first graduates being Angela Merkel and Bill Gates.
[00:41:37.511 --> 00:41:42.592]  And we would have understood already then what we will show you now through this proceeding.
[00:41:43.032 --> 00:41:51.714]  These financial crimes went unchallenged by our politicians because they're aiding and abetting those who commit them and profiting from these crimes.
[00:41:54.153 --> 00:41:56.114]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is so powerful.
[00:41:56.134 --> 00:42:02.918]  We're going to have big excerpts of this for you in the fourth hour, but links to the whole thing are at InfoWars.com right now.
[00:42:03.498 --> 00:42:09.422]  International criminal grand jury investigation, psychopathic global issues, COVID to commit crimes against humanity.
[00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:11.112]  This will bring them down.
[00:42:11.252 --> 00:42:12.313]  This has all the proof.
[00:42:12.613 --> 00:42:15.795]  You've got to share it like your life depends on it, because it does.
[00:42:15.855 --> 00:42:18.757]  The children are counting on us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:19.137 --> 00:42:25.742]  In places like Austria, the deadly Covid jab is now mandatory, six months in prison, and force injections.
[00:42:27.023 --> 00:42:28.344]  The end of the Nuremberg Code.
[00:42:28.864 --> 00:42:31.706]  The greatest tyranny ever seen at this scale.
[00:42:32.574 --> 00:42:38.679]  Former BlackRock executive's gone public as a whistleblower says Big Pharma's liability shields could be at risk if fraud is discovered.
[00:42:38.719 --> 00:42:42.822]  He now says it is, and depopulation, and it gets worse.
[00:42:43.703 --> 00:42:51.328]  Now the Pentagon has confirmed major whistleblowers that went public, confirming massive death and illnesses inside of the military, with the deadly shot.
[00:42:51.629 --> 00:42:52.649]  This is genocide.
[00:42:52.669 --> 00:42:55.031]  This is a globalist attack on our military.
[00:42:55.051 --> 00:42:56.051]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:56.051 --> 00:43:01.051]  [Music]
[00:43:01.051 --> 00:43:10.051]   InfoWars is all about setting new trends, starting new systems of awakening.
[00:43:10.148 --> 00:43:20.453]  We are not here chasing and following Hollywood or the DC crowd or the New York elitist or any of these people's worldviews or ideas.
[00:43:20.833 --> 00:43:21.753]  We know who they are.
[00:43:21.773 --> 00:43:22.854]  We know what they're pushing.
[00:43:23.454 --> 00:43:25.915]  We know that their transhumanism is not a new idea.
[00:43:25.955 --> 00:43:27.736]  It goes back to the Garden of Eden.
[00:43:28.696 --> 00:43:39.546]  It is a satanic lie that we can transcend our bodies and become gods by merging with these different systems that the corrupt globalist priesthood has built.
[00:43:40.942 --> 00:43:52.830]  And to get us to accept transhumanism, to get us to believe our bodies are evil and bad, and that only the state or biomedical systems can save us, they have created the whole COVID-19 hysteria and fear.
[00:43:53.270 --> 00:44:10.422]  To brainwash and abuse our children with masks and poison shots to teach us that we're inherently evil and bad and have to have the satanic sacrament of the GMO gene therapy injected into our bodies for the privilege to go outside and go to the park or have a job or fly on an airplane.
[00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:18.045]  And that's why it's more important than ever to realize that humanity is desperate for the truth.
[00:44:18.485 --> 00:44:26.348]  And with the almost total censorship happening in mainstream television and now even the internet, that makes info wars more precious than ever.
[00:44:26.988 --> 00:44:31.630]  And so a lot of times, we set trends that are new and trailblazing.
[00:44:32.563 --> 00:44:40.306]  In other cases, we bring back things that are old, but that are absolutely crucial because of the changing battlefield that we face.
[00:44:40.826 --> 00:44:42.727]  And a great example of that is DVD.
[00:44:43.407 --> 00:44:44.668]  I've made 20-plus films.
[00:44:44.988 --> 00:44:48.649]  We always sell some of them, even though DVD in the last decade has been phased out.
[00:44:49.229 --> 00:44:58.013]  And suddenly, I noticed that we were selling out of all of my old-back catalog of films.
[00:44:59.523 --> 00:45:01.905]  And I asked myself, why is that happening?
[00:45:02.525 --> 00:45:06.727]  So we emailed some of the customers and asked them, why are you suddenly buying DVDs?
[00:45:07.448 --> 00:45:11.710]  And they told us, it's because we know we need to have a hard copy in our library.
[00:45:12.091 --> 00:45:16.834]  We know because of censorship, we've got to go back to the old days, Alex, when you would put your films out.
[00:45:17.728 --> 00:45:22.211]  to the public and tell them to make copies of the DVD, and we had a huge effect.
[00:45:22.511 --> 00:45:24.712]  Millions of copies were handed out to folks.
[00:45:25.252 --> 00:45:31.716]  And so, organically, the listeners are trailblazing by going back to low-tech to get around the censors.
[00:45:32.296 --> 00:45:37.099]  They're making copies of the DVD, giving it to others, and telling them, make copies of the DVD.
[00:45:37.399 --> 00:45:42.002]  So, Covidland, the mask, part two, incredibly powerful, an activist tool.
[00:45:42.862 --> 00:45:43.462]  It's now out.
[00:45:43.882 --> 00:45:44.683]  It's now available.
[00:45:44.963 --> 00:45:45.803]  We want you to get it.
[00:45:45.843 --> 00:45:47.183]  We want you to make copies of it.
[00:45:47.403 --> 00:45:48.284]  We want you to share it.
[00:45:48.564 --> 00:45:53.265]  And when you do that, you get two films on one DVD, absolutely free with it.
[00:45:53.525 --> 00:45:56.766]  Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and The Order of Death.
[00:45:57.086 --> 00:46:01.788]  And then that funds our operation and the filmmakers operation when you buy the one film.
[00:46:02.068 --> 00:46:06.349]  So it's available until the 13th at infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:07.009 --> 00:46:18.176]  February 13, 2022 is your last chance to get COVIDLAND, the film, Part 2, The Mask, for $19.95 and get two other films for your library.
[00:46:18.216 --> 00:46:25.180]  And then I want you to take all three of these films and make copies of them and share them with everyone you know.
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:31.604]  We can only offer this again for the next two weeks until February 13th and then this deal is going to be over.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:38.405]  I cannot express to you enough how important it is to let people know this is censored information.
[00:46:38.725 --> 00:46:51.956]  Both the films on The Occult and The Globalist, and both the documentaries that are out, Part 1 and Part 2, on COVID land, of the real history and what really happened, and the real science that The Globalist are desperate for you not to learn.
[00:46:52.316 --> 00:46:53.757]  So thank you all for your support.
[00:46:54.058 --> 00:46:59.362]  Get your copy of COVID Land, The Mask, Part 2 and Part 1 as well at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:06.663]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:07.184 --> 00:47:08.505]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:11.708 --> 00:47:15.951]  Don't break me down.
[00:47:16.131 --> 00:47:21.316]  I've been traveling too long.
[00:47:21.736 --> 00:47:25.759]  I've been trying too hard.
[00:47:25.619 --> 00:47:43.899]   This is a special edition of the Sunday edition of the Ellen Stone Show.
[00:47:43.928 --> 00:47:48.391]  Normally I come in here from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:47:48.411 --> 00:47:49.332]  and love every minute of it.
[00:47:50.012 --> 00:48:00.249]   It's a great honor being able to talk to so many of you, but tonight I'm gonna host Sunday live that Owen Schroer and Harrison Smith and Christy Lee rotate through.
[00:48:00.269 --> 00:48:06.014]  This is important every Sunday to have live information as the week begins.
[00:48:06.054 --> 00:48:11.780]  But tonight I'm going to be hosting and the first 45 minutes or so we're going to get into Joe Rogan.
[00:48:12.788 --> 00:48:26.997]  Now they're trying to take him off the air and now they're going through his whole catalog of things he's said and done and are really fighting to remove him because they have to remove the idea of you being able to listen to what you want and for you being able to question their narrative and their fraud.
[00:48:28.646 --> 00:48:32.608]  You know, I know basically quite a bit of the inside baseball, the whole thing.
[00:48:33.169 --> 00:48:48.777]  I'm not at liberty to get into all of it or why more of the episodes have been taken down by Spotify and the rest of it, but this will be critical information for all of our free speech and our First Amendment here in the United States, what I cover at the start of Sunday Live, 6 p.m.
[00:48:48.817 --> 00:48:49.098]  tonight.
[00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:53.212]  Roll over from the Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:53.232 --> 00:48:55.113]  A lot of stations are picking up Sunday live.
[00:48:55.393 --> 00:48:57.335]  We only carry six minutes of ads an hour.
[00:48:57.595 --> 00:48:58.816]  Those are the local spots.
[00:48:58.956 --> 00:48:59.796]  No network breaks.
[00:49:00.477 --> 00:49:04.640]  And that's as we phase in over the next few years into the podcast format.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:09.203]  We'll still have a setup, though, for all of our great affiliates out there.
[00:49:09.663 --> 00:49:42.820]   And as I said, March 1st, I'm going to start two nights a week and then on Saturdays, Doing at least a two-hour live commercial free show every single day for calls and guests and more because these are such intense incredible times and the globalists have been trying to take us off the air and are desperately fighting to try to get me arrested or indicted and arrested and just trying to you know it's their admitted goal because our work is so important to do that and so yes the candle burns only half as long that burns twice as bright
[00:49:43.490 --> 00:49:46.332]  We're burning the candle at more than both ends.
[00:49:46.672 --> 00:49:49.714]  Ever thrown a candle into a fire and it just explodes like gasoline?
[00:49:50.054 --> 00:49:51.315]  Well, that's that's Infowars.
[00:49:51.375 --> 00:49:56.037]  We're pedal to the metal, Mad Max all the way, not playing games, totally committed.
[00:49:56.057 --> 00:49:58.439]  So you know how real this is and how over the target we are.
[00:49:58.939 --> 00:50:03.102]  Now, Roger Stone's joining us in the next hour.
[00:50:03.362 --> 00:50:04.542]  And I should have hyped this better.
[00:50:04.563 --> 00:50:09.045]  I just get so much in my mind going on because he's been on fire lately.
[00:50:09.065 --> 00:50:10.306]  He's always informative.
[00:50:11.119 --> 00:50:18.725]  And he has been heavily involved with the massive canvassing in Florida and other states that I saw being covered on OAN Friday.
[00:50:18.745 --> 00:50:24.250]  He's been involved in it, and they have found 30-40% of the voters are fake.
[00:50:25.391 --> 00:50:28.954]  And they found that, of course, it's for the Democrats' side.
[00:50:29.434 --> 00:50:31.416]  Almost none of it is skewed towards Republicans.
[00:50:31.436 --> 00:50:36.299]   There is some of that, but 90 plus percent is skewed towards Democrats.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:42.445]  So they show up at people's houses that voted in the last election, and they go, no, we've lived here five years.
[00:50:43.466 --> 00:50:44.727]  And that person never lived here.
[00:50:45.027 --> 00:50:50.272]  I bought this house from A or Z. In some of the cases, they go, yeah, that guy moved out six months ago.
[00:50:51.713 --> 00:50:55.297]  But in large portions of the cases, it's totally fake.
[00:50:55.557 --> 00:50:56.538]  But the people are voting.
[00:50:57.836 --> 00:51:00.337]  They have a name, they live there, but they don't really live there.
[00:51:00.657 --> 00:51:02.677]  They live in California, but they're voting in Florida.
[00:51:03.238 --> 00:51:05.818]  Or they're voting in Texas, but they live in New York.
[00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:12.760]  I mean, and a lot of these are Democrats that know what's going on, and they move all around the country and vote three or four times every election.
[00:51:14.421 --> 00:51:15.721]  So, that's huge news.
[00:51:16.963 --> 00:51:18.423]  But we're not supposed to question it, right?
[00:51:18.483 --> 00:51:20.804]  Like, don't be racist towards Chinese people.
[00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:24.165]  CNN told us for years, and ABC, there's no Chinese spies.
[00:51:24.785 --> 00:51:26.906]  And now the FBI director's like, they're taking over!
[00:51:26.946 --> 00:51:27.726]  It's an emergency!
[00:51:27.786 --> 00:51:28.786]  I'm blown away!
[00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.146]  This is the biggest threat ever!
[00:51:30.427 --> 00:51:31.147]  I can't believe it!
[00:51:32.687 --> 00:51:37.868]  All because the Chinese have bitch-slapped them, and said, no, you work for us now, not the other way around.
[00:51:38.709 --> 00:51:39.749]  And we're gonna have three kids.
[00:51:41.076 --> 00:51:50.602]  As China openly owns four of the six production houses that literally teach that young boys should all be castrated and be little girls while it's illegal in China.
[00:51:50.823 --> 00:51:57.927]  But China pays and broadcasts, cut your boys' penises off, cut your boys' penises off, cut your... I mean, that's what they do!
[00:51:57.947 --> 00:52:00.329]  And we're like, yes sir, we're liberal!
[00:52:01.078 --> 00:52:01.518]  Get in there!
[00:52:01.538 --> 00:52:07.662]  And if they convince a five-year-old that they're really a girl, then, at age seven, it's time for the surgery.
[00:52:07.722 --> 00:52:12.024]  And I don't hate people that grow up who are adults, who feel like that's who they are, and they do that.
[00:52:12.664 --> 00:52:27.232]  The point is, is that the chemicals are in the water, everything's in the food, genital sizes are shrinking down, men are becoming more effeminate, because in utero, in the first trimester, there's a whole spectrum of chemicals that cause the male fetus to not fully develop into a male.
[00:52:28.116 --> 00:52:32.340]  Uh, and, uh, the basic stamp of a fetus in the zygote stage is female.
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.002]  And that's people ask, why do men have nipples?
[00:52:35.182 --> 00:52:40.587]  I mean, well, cause the, the stamp and the original code, uh, of the embryo.
[00:52:40.727 --> 00:52:43.229]  And of course it gets into the sperm and deciding the sex.
[00:52:43.509 --> 00:52:54.798]  I mean, from the time the zygote's formed, it's a male or female, but the, the, the, the main imprint of the skeletal structure and the entire structure of the body, uh, is, is female.
[00:52:54.858 --> 00:52:56.800]  And then the male traits, uh, develop.
[00:52:57.972 --> 00:52:59.273]  That is cut off by the chemicals.
[00:52:59.313 --> 00:53:02.635]  So this is a giant, admitted globalist plan.
[00:53:02.795 --> 00:53:04.276]  And by the way, I forgot to air it on Friday.
[00:53:05.376 --> 00:53:11.840]  The head of Turning Point USA, Charlie Kirk, just gets more and more hardcore.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.201]  I didn't like him.
[00:53:13.241 --> 00:53:14.401]  I mean, I met him in RNC 2000.
[00:53:15.916 --> 00:53:17.537]  Sixteen, he seemed like a likable fellow.
[00:53:18.317 --> 00:53:26.142]  And I thought they did some good, but, you know, kind of pop Republicans and fun, fun, fun and kind of, oh, we're nice to liberals, come join our big tent.
[00:53:26.622 --> 00:53:27.863]  That just didn't seem hardcore to me.
[00:53:27.903 --> 00:53:37.988]  But now he's out there saying transgenderism is about transhumanism and about giving up on our humanity and becoming machines, because that's really what it is.
[00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:39.909]  And now Steve Bannon gets it.
[00:53:39.949 --> 00:53:40.249]  Everybody.
[00:53:40.309 --> 00:53:43.131]  And so we either get this or we get destroyed by it.
[00:53:44.332 --> 00:53:49.059]   Because It's real, and it's going on, and it's meant to destroy us.
[00:53:49.739 --> 00:53:59.642]  If you reach 18 years of age, and you want to be a woman, or you want to be a man, or you want to, you know, whatever it is you want to be, I'm for you being able to do that if that's your choice.
[00:53:59.662 --> 00:54:00.323]  Okay?
[00:54:00.663 --> 00:54:10.866]  But do not target children, and brainwash them, and then say they've made that decision before they're of age, and then have the state come in, and guide them into destruction and annihilation.
[00:54:11.846 --> 00:54:14.227]  So we'll get that Charlie Kirk clip as well.
[00:54:15.535 --> 00:54:16.535]  I went down a rabbit trail.
[00:54:16.795 --> 00:54:20.357]  That's one reason Roger Stone's coming on the huge election fraud news.
[00:54:20.737 --> 00:54:29.040]  The big one is he is really upset about Russia and really upset about Biden trying to launch a war as his midterm election diversion.
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:37.183]  And just where all this is going and the failure of Republicans to stand up against this.
[00:54:37.203 --> 00:54:43.165]  I mean, we got polls out of 76 to 82 percent of Americans, Democrats, Republicans, you name it.
[00:54:44.179 --> 00:54:50.925]  Do not want war, and do not want to be on the doorstep of Russia starting a fight with them and moving heavy weapons in.
[00:54:51.706 --> 00:55:04.777]  I mean, imagine if Russia had moved $5 billion of weapons, anti-aircraft, anti-tank weapons, cluster bombs, you name it, right up to the Toronto-US border with Niagara Falls.
[00:55:05.778 --> 00:55:09.581]  Or imagine if they'd moved it up to, say, South Texas.
[00:55:11.613 --> 00:55:20.517]  It's crazy, ladies and gentlemen, and now they're out there saying, oh, the invasion's coming any day, the war's about to start any day, oh, they're gonna stage an attack on their own troops!
[00:55:20.937 --> 00:55:33.082]  And Russia's like, no we're not, no we're not, no we're not, you're amassing weapons, we put troops on our borders in case you launch an attack, it's clear you're about to launch an attack, and you're saying we're gonna launch an attack against ourselves as a pretext, which is a real thing that happens.
[00:55:34.142 --> 00:55:39.104]  But, do you trust that the globalists are the ones starting the fight, or do you trust that it's the Russians doing it?
[00:55:40.129 --> 00:55:42.453]  I mean, who do you think is behind it?
[00:55:42.673 --> 00:55:43.394]  Who do you trust?
[00:55:43.514 --> 00:55:44.376]  Who do you not trust?
[00:55:45.595 --> 00:55:59.778]  And so, it's very obvious to me with the history, and the background, and what they're doing, and the proxy war already happening in Ukraine, that the globalist forces are going to try to stage a provocation to get the Russians to fight back when the Russians get attacked.
[00:56:00.118 --> 00:56:05.559]  And when the Russians fight back, they're going to say that the Russians attacked themselves.
[00:56:05.999 --> 00:56:15.382]   Any footage the Russians show of any buildings that get blown up, or any tanks that get blown up, or any military bases that get attacked, they're going to say that The Russians attacked themselves.
[00:56:16.744 --> 00:56:17.986]  And that's how World War II started.
[00:56:18.006 --> 00:56:22.432]  Hitler attacked his own military base on the Polish border at Gleiwitz in Operation Himmler.
[00:56:22.672 --> 00:56:24.935]  We'll cover it all with Roger Stone next hour.
[00:56:25.015 --> 00:56:25.576]  Don't forget!
[00:56:26.463 --> 00:56:27.925]  Now is the time to get prepared.
[00:56:28.285 --> 00:56:32.430]  Now is the time to have your bug out plan and you need storable food.

[00:56:42.762 --> 00:56:43.904]  because they've got such quality.
[00:56:44.898 --> 00:56:46.720]  They're only 15 years old, but they're the biggest in the U.S.
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.563]  now because of great customer service and great quality and great prices.

[00:57:20.165 --> 00:57:22.206]  So we're their biggest distributor out of thousands.
[00:57:23.007 --> 00:57:23.667]  Nobody else gets it.

[00:57:28.712 --> 00:57:34.404]   I'll probably You know, twist their arm another day or so, but there's only five or six days left on this.
[00:57:34.965 --> 00:57:41.152]  Info Wars, I guess seven, eight days left on this at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:42.073 --> 00:57:44.376]  And there's a lot of other great products at InfoWarsStore.com as well.
[00:57:44.416 --> 00:57:44.857]  Stay with us.
[00:57:44.917 --> 00:57:46.239]  Roger Stone coming up, hour number two.
[00:57:50.643 --> 00:57:57.910]  Most people will tell you you need three things to safely own a firearm so you can protect yourself, your business, and your family.
[00:57:58.250 --> 00:58:01.574]  They'll tell you you need training, you need a firearm, and you need ammunition.
[00:58:02.779 --> 00:58:07.243]  But you also need insurance, just like with a car or with a house.
[00:58:07.623 --> 00:58:14.609]  You need to have what Kyle Rittenhouse didn't have when he defended himself and others and was found not guilty.
[00:58:15.189 --> 00:58:18.311]  It took him millions of dollars to defend himself.
[00:58:18.952 --> 00:58:25.717]  How can the average person rest assured that while they're protecting their family, their business and their own lives, that they're safe?
[00:58:26.378 --> 00:58:31.362]  You do that with high quality insurance that protects you when you use the firearm.
[00:58:31.582 --> 00:58:33.864]  To defend yourself, your property, or your family.
[00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:36.966]  This is something that is so incredibly important.
[00:58:36.986 --> 00:58:39.748]  Now there's a lot of companies out there offering insurance.
[00:58:39.768 --> 00:58:40.628]  A lot of great companies.
[00:58:41.269 --> 00:58:48.414]  But the Palmetto State Armory is moving very very strongly into this market with the best package out there that we found.
[00:58:48.874 --> 00:58:52.397]  This is real certified insurance at an incredibly low price.
[00:58:53.237 --> 00:59:01.261]  The plans start at just $10.95 a month, up to $2 million of coverage, with multiple levels of protection to choose from.
[00:59:01.861 --> 00:59:08.545]  Depending on which tier you sign up for, you get between $20 and $100 on your gift card for simply signing up for the first month.
[00:59:09.165 --> 00:59:14.646]  And you are promoting an organization that is pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment, pro-free speech, and pro-America.
[00:59:15.067 --> 00:59:17.287]  Here's an example of insurance in your life.
[00:59:17.767 --> 00:59:26.850]  We've been covering antifa violence for many years, and they've gotten so vicious, we had to buy an armored vehicle three years ago to just go out and cover the events.
[00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:37.450]   This is a form of insurance, and it costs a lot more than the very low prices at protectwithalex.com. You need the insurance of protectwithalex.com
[00:59:37.450 --> 00:59:42.361]   to sleep securely at night knowing you're prepared and have up to two million dollars
[00:59:42.361 --> 00:59:47.330]   of coverage ready to protect your life and your liberty. Go to protectwithalex.com today and

[00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:58.171]  are the resistance.
[00:59:58.171 --> 01:00:15.451]  [Music]
[01:00:15.451 --> 01:00:18.811]   All right, Roger Stone's coming up next segment with a lot of huge
[01:00:18.811 --> 01:00:21.451]  breaking news and amazing insights.
[01:00:21.627 --> 01:00:28.477]  But I want to play a clip of Charlie Kirk, who I have just seen as a nice guy, somewhat effective with young people.
[01:00:29.647 --> 01:00:30.668]  But not very hardcore.
[01:00:30.688 --> 01:00:37.692]  But more and more every day I see him talking about the New World Order and transgenderism really being a system for transhumanism.
[01:00:38.273 --> 01:00:40.554]  And just, you know, the great reset in the New World Order.
[01:00:40.694 --> 01:00:42.455]  This is great news.
[01:00:42.916 --> 01:00:45.978]  And so I guess Turning Point is having a turning point.
[01:00:46.018 --> 01:00:46.418]  Here it is.
[01:00:47.947 --> 01:00:50.490]  And this is to go a level deeper, but you guys are smart and you'll get it.
[01:00:50.771 --> 01:01:02.186]  The transgender movement actually matters even more than biomedical fascism and they actually are together because the transgender movement is an introductory phase to get you to strip yourself of your humanity to mesh with machines.
[01:01:02.967 --> 01:01:04.108]  It's called transhumanism.
[01:01:04.528 --> 01:01:10.511]  They want you to say, okay, well I can choose any gender, why can't I just have like an exoskeleton of some sort of machine around me?
[01:01:10.811 --> 01:01:14.853]  This is what meta is about, the metaverse, kids staring at screens all day long.
[01:01:15.093 --> 01:01:17.955]  This is documented, this is proven, this is where Silicon Valley is going.
[01:01:18.295 --> 01:01:23.918]  This is why they're so insistent on this transgender thing, because if you stop being a man, then maybe you can stop being a human being.
[01:01:24.318 --> 01:01:26.099]  Maybe you can kind of just plug into some sort of machine.
[01:01:26.419 --> 01:01:29.359]  This is where their control, their profit motive is coming down the stream.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.000]  There's a ton of literature about this.
[01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:35.681]  I'm far from the first person to comment on it, but I'm just kind of connecting the dots for all of you.
[01:01:35.701 --> 01:01:36.822]  Like, what is the agenda here?
[01:01:37.222 --> 01:01:48.625]  Well, the agenda is kind of like Ready Player One meets Inception, where you kind of just hook up to a machine all day long and you're controlled by five companies that control your thoughts and your feelings, and the real world actually ends up being the not real world.
[01:01:49.298 --> 01:01:51.242]  Where everyone just kind of wears goggles all day long.
[01:01:51.602 --> 01:01:54.768]  That's the deeper significance of the transgender movement that no one wants to talk about.
[01:01:55.189 --> 01:01:55.429]  David?
[01:01:55.890 --> 01:01:56.431]  Wow!
[01:01:57.032 --> 01:01:58.915]  That is better said than I can put it together.
[01:01:58.995 --> 01:01:59.616]  Bravo!
[01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:03.418]  All right, now Roger Stone is loaded for bear.
[01:02:03.818 --> 01:02:09.660]  I've known Roger eight, nine years, got to know him really good, six and a half years ago or so, but man, he's really been on fire.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.181]  I've not just had him on my show and seen that.
[01:02:11.201 --> 01:02:11.861]  He's been on other shows.
[01:02:11.901 --> 01:02:12.582]  I've seen the clips.
[01:02:13.642 --> 01:02:15.723]  And he's going to get into a whole host of subjects.
[01:02:15.803 --> 01:02:27.048]  Russiagate 3.0, the war with Russia, the election fraud they're finding, the canvassing, finding out how many people voted but don't live at the house they're claiming they did.
[01:02:27.528 --> 01:02:28.388]  Big news there.
[01:02:28.408 --> 01:02:36.578]   But I want to play this clip of Peter Baker on MSNBC saying the Russians are the Alex Joneses of the world.
[01:02:36.899 --> 01:02:44.267]  So I tell you, and the State Department claiming that Russia is going to launch a false flag as the Alex Jones of the world, but also the Russians are Alex Jones.
[01:02:44.567 --> 01:02:45.589]  Everybody's Alex Jones.
[01:02:45.769 --> 01:02:47.371]  We're all in Alex Jones territory now.
[01:02:47.591 --> 01:02:47.991]  Here it is.
[01:02:48.925 --> 01:02:49.505]  Peter, the U.S.
[01:02:49.525 --> 01:02:58.271]  has released a lot of information about this alleged Russian threat, including intelligence about an alleged fake video plot.
[01:02:59.652 --> 01:03:00.993]  It all seems so incredible.
[01:03:01.033 --> 01:03:03.094]  You've covered Putin and Russia for a long time.
[01:03:03.774 --> 01:03:06.296]  Will releasing this information make a difference?
[01:03:08.137 --> 01:03:22.487]  Well, I think you heard John Finer say that the idea is if we put out there that we know the United States knows that this is what they're going to do, it won't damage any credibility such a false flag operation would have if they tried it and in fact it's a deterrence to information.
[01:03:22.827 --> 01:03:26.870]  You know, look, this is, you know, the Russians are sort of the Alex Jones of world powers.
[01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:33.955]  They're, they traffic in conspiracy theories, they believe conspiracies by the West that are sort of far-fetched and they promote them.
[01:03:34.655 --> 01:03:37.837]  Uh, through, you know, these sort of provocative actions at home.
[01:03:37.857 --> 01:03:48.625]  I remember when they first went in and seized Crimea from Ukraine back in 2014, they pretended that those men in green suits were not Russian troops, when in fact, of course, they were.
[01:03:48.665 --> 01:03:54.388]  So this is all of, you know, normal practice out of Moscow.
[01:03:54.428 --> 01:04:02.374]  And I think what you're seeing here by the United States is a way of trying to call them on it in advance rather than after the fact, trying to say, oh, that wasn't real.
[01:04:03.334 --> 01:04:04.035]  That was just fake.
[01:04:04.956 --> 01:04:12.243]  So, there's been no, I mean, I don't know if they can, I mean, release any kind of evidence of this thing happening, right?
[01:04:12.263 --> 01:04:14.245]  Because it's, so far what the U.S.
[01:04:14.285 --> 01:04:19.550]  is saying is they're planning the possibility of maybe doing a movie.
[01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:25.533]  Yeah, I think that's, you know, you heard a lot of discussions in the State Department briefing yesterday.
[01:04:25.553 --> 01:04:29.937]  Reporters pressing, of course, Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, for proof of this.
[01:04:29.977 --> 01:04:36.303]  The United States government says, of course, they don't want to do anything to compromise intelligence sources and methods.
[01:04:36.704 --> 01:04:40.428]  And, you know, look, it's... So in the old days, Colin Powell would stand up there with fake anthrax.
[01:04:41.228 --> 01:04:43.891]  Or they'd show you some fake WMD images on the satellite.
[01:04:44.111 --> 01:04:44.912]  They don't even do that now.
[01:04:44.932 --> 01:04:48.596]  They just say, trust us, they're going to attack themselves as U.S.
[01:04:48.616 --> 01:04:50.257]  forces mass on the Russian border.
[01:04:50.598 --> 01:04:50.958]  Okay.
[01:04:51.499 --> 01:04:53.260]  I mean, there's no end to this, folks.
[01:04:54.141 --> 01:04:55.683]  The Russians aren't attacking us.
[01:04:55.743 --> 01:04:57.525]  Joe Biden and the globalists are.
[01:04:57.685 --> 01:04:59.607]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone.
[01:05:03.237 --> 01:05:13.408]  Whether they were present that day or were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy, we will follow the facts wherever they lead.
[01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:18.892]  The days of independent media are numbered.
[01:05:19.212 --> 01:05:21.614]  The government has made it illegal to oppose them.
[01:05:22.315 --> 01:05:24.657]  They are now debanking us behind the scenes.
[01:05:25.198 --> 01:05:28.000]  They want to bankrupt us and make us go away quietly.
[01:05:28.961 --> 01:05:36.667]  With practically half the population wanting to lock the unvaccinated up in camps, the traitors know they can shut us down by force.
[01:05:37.408 --> 01:05:39.950]  But that would accelerate the awakening exponentially.
[01:05:40.631 --> 01:05:41.131]  So be it.
[01:05:42.092 --> 01:05:43.874]  Make them silence us by force.
[01:05:44.495 --> 01:05:46.957]  This is the final battle of the information war.

[01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:52.702]  Before everything changes.
[01:05:53.323 --> 01:05:55.705]  We need you to carry us through to the end.
[01:05:56.146 --> 01:05:57.066]  Victory or death.
[01:05:57.307 --> 01:06:00.307]  Go now to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:06:01.307 --> 01:06:05.307]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.

[01:06:13.307 --> 01:06:15.307]  (music)
[01:06:14.924 --> 01:06:20.007]  Well, he has not re-risen like the mythical phoenix because he's never been killed.
[01:06:21.868 --> 01:06:26.091]  But, Roger Stone is definitely what we call punished.
[01:06:27.612 --> 01:06:31.234]  And there's a lot of art on the internet that shows myself, Roger, Trump, and others as punished.
[01:06:31.275 --> 01:06:33.376]  You know, eye patches, cuts on us, the rest of it.
[01:06:33.396 --> 01:06:34.577]  But, we are punished.
[01:06:35.537 --> 01:06:38.130]   And by being punished, We have learned a lot.
[01:06:38.210 --> 01:06:38.850]  We've been through a lot.
[01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.871]  We've gotten stronger, as Nietzsche said, along the way.
[01:06:41.931 --> 01:06:43.732]  That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
[01:06:43.772 --> 01:06:51.565]   But because Roger is a stalwart and a tough guy, and I would think of myself as pretty tough as well, We need to remind listeners that we are embattled.
[01:06:51.665 --> 01:06:52.965]  We are under massive attack.
[01:06:53.005 --> 01:06:54.385]  And we need one thing first.
[01:06:54.945 --> 01:06:56.285]  Your prayer, please.
[01:06:56.806 --> 01:06:57.506]  I know it's real.
[01:06:57.886 --> 01:06:58.466]  I can feel it.
[01:06:58.586 --> 01:06:59.326]  I see it in my life.
[01:06:59.646 --> 01:07:00.346]  Thank you listeners.
[01:07:00.386 --> 01:07:01.106]  Please pray for us.
[01:07:01.487 --> 01:07:03.407]  Because they are coming after us again.
[01:07:03.827 --> 01:07:06.147]  And coming down on us like 8,000 pound gorillas.
[01:07:06.408 --> 01:07:07.088]  Which is okay.
[01:07:07.108 --> 01:07:07.668]  We're big boys.
[01:07:07.688 --> 01:07:08.388]  We're not going to stop.
[01:07:08.768 --> 01:07:10.448]  At many levels, we like it.
[01:07:10.928 --> 01:07:13.109]  It makes us get up earlier in the morning and have more energy.
[01:07:13.189 --> 01:07:13.409]  But...
[01:07:14.198 --> 01:07:26.109]  For our children, for our wives, and for our country, please pray for us because we are the tip of the spear and we're just so damn effective thanks to the good gifts God gave us and you keeping us in the fight.
[01:07:26.189 --> 01:07:47.106]   You are just as important as Roger and I and others at the Globalist and the Satanic Left hate because you are keeping us in the fight and we salute you and we thank you and you can see The all-out war to take OAN down, and the all-out war to take down Mike Lindell, the all-out war to silence Trump, and the all-out war to silence Tucker Carlson and now Joe Rogan.
[01:07:47.846 --> 01:07:50.288]  And if they can get us completely, they're gonna get you.
[01:07:50.528 --> 01:07:54.091]  Deplatforming four years ago, then debanking, now they want us arrested.
[01:07:54.551 --> 01:07:55.732]  Rogers been SWAT teamed.
[01:07:56.813 --> 01:07:57.093]  Okay?
[01:07:57.494 --> 01:08:00.776]  They have gone to grand jury after grand jury, and I don't say this like thumb in my nose.
[01:08:01.176 --> 01:08:04.739]  Like, haha, you've gone to a bunch of grand juries to indict me and they haven't!
[01:08:04.779 --> 01:08:07.980]   I don't know, I'm not somebody that Dances by graveyards.
[01:08:08.060 --> 01:08:11.622]  No, I'm not feeling feeling slick and feeling like oh, no.
[01:08:11.702 --> 01:08:13.743]  I'm like my god We got a criminal government here.
[01:08:14.203 --> 01:08:26.948]  My lawyers are like don't tell people what's been going on Let's just say this I tell folks you better pray for us You might just you know, see me in jail or dead with these people coming after us this bad same with Roger This isn't a game.
[01:08:27.108 --> 01:08:29.269]  We're trying to start war with Russia right now.
[01:08:29.329 --> 01:08:35.865]   So listen, I I don't want to sit there and prove to you how serious this is by us going off the air in six months because of finances.
[01:08:36.205 --> 01:08:41.291]  I don't want to have to prove to you how serious this is by us losing the country or having World War III with Russia.
[01:08:42.232 --> 01:08:43.473]  I want to be peaceful.
[01:08:43.834 --> 01:08:45.356]  Democrat, Republican, all of us.
[01:08:45.396 --> 01:08:51.563]  This is the time to come together and say no to the multinational corporations that have launched this new world order.
[01:08:52.682 --> 01:08:59.364]  And they're playing us all against each other, because I don't care if you're a Republican, a Democrat, gay, straight, live in Canada, live in Mexico, it doesn't matter.
[01:08:59.624 --> 01:09:03.266]  The New World Order, the Great Reset, is not good for you.
[01:09:03.526 --> 01:09:09.388]  You can wear the mask, go along with the shots, pretend you're part of the power structure, but you're only engaged in the Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:09:09.688 --> 01:09:14.610]  So usually I ask for support at the end of an interview with Roger and myself, but I'm just going to up front say this.
[01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:21.193]   The way our finances work, and with supply chains broken down, Now, 25 weeks to get products.
[01:09:21.674 --> 01:09:27.799]  I'm having to put the money in not six weeks before I get the product, to have it manufactured, half the money.
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:30.701]  I'm having to put it out 20 plus weeks.
[01:09:31.201 --> 01:09:33.984]  So we got stuff coming in a few weeks that I paid for 20 weeks ago.
[01:09:34.584 --> 01:09:37.907]  And then now I'm having to, okay, well, let's put it out 10 weeks and put it out 20 weeks.
[01:09:39.378 --> 01:09:43.081]  Because of that, we don't have the cash flow to do that, to even be able to self-fund.
[01:09:43.181 --> 01:09:48.704]  So I need everybody now to do things like get a Reset Wars membership and watch the course.
[01:09:49.065 --> 01:09:53.167]  Because that doesn't have inventory, it's digital, and it's great material and it funds the operation.
[01:09:53.808 --> 01:09:55.649]  50% off, it's gonna have to end Monday.
[01:09:55.929 --> 01:09:57.130]  We've extended it since Friday.
[01:09:57.370 --> 01:09:58.391]  ResetWars.com.
[01:09:58.851 --> 01:09:59.992]  I need you to go get t-shirts.
[01:10:00.032 --> 01:10:01.253]  It's not as hard to get those.
[01:10:01.513 --> 01:10:02.954]  I get those in five weeks now.
[01:10:03.174 --> 01:10:04.115]  When you start getting them in a week.
[01:10:05.416 --> 01:10:06.937]  Get a book, get a film, get a DVD.
[01:10:08.172 --> 01:10:11.115]  Get a water filtration, whatever we've got in stock, it's all great products.
[01:10:12.056 --> 01:10:16.740]  I'm telling you, I'm telling you that we're in the most grave situation ever.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:23.806]  The whole country is, the whole world, you don't need me to tell you this, but they've got lying headlines about how I've got hundreds of millions of dollars, all of it's total fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:24.146 --> 01:10:24.807]  None of it's true.
[01:10:25.328 --> 01:10:32.294]  Infowarstore.com, go there, support us, and support our local Aminathem affiliates as well, because I need your support now.
[01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:35.332]  You need to get great products at the same time.
[01:10:35.372 --> 01:10:37.313]  We have X3 been sold out for months and months.
[01:10:37.693 --> 01:10:38.413]  It's back in stock.
[01:10:38.493 --> 01:10:39.814]  All three good types of iodine.
[01:10:40.114 --> 01:10:41.255]  Most people are deficient in it.
[01:10:41.495 --> 01:10:42.616]  This is an amazing product.
[01:10:42.676 --> 01:10:43.377]  It's back in stock.
[01:10:43.937 --> 01:10:44.497]  50% off.
[01:10:44.777 --> 01:10:45.418]  So much more.
[01:10:45.718 --> 01:10:48.700]  Please keep us on the air because we're entering our most critical time.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.421]  Look at what they're doing with Rogan.
[01:10:50.881 --> 01:10:51.742]  With Carlson.
[01:10:51.902 --> 01:10:52.262]  All of this.
[01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:54.603]  But we're staying at our stations and fighting.
[01:10:54.644 --> 01:10:59.627]  But Roger and I have gone further in the persecution arc than basically everybody else.
[01:11:00.547 --> 01:11:01.708]  That's for a reason.
[01:11:01.768 --> 01:11:05.651]  So I wanted to, up front, before we hit Russia, before we hit all this news, talk about that.
[01:11:06.252 --> 01:11:09.014]  How serious is this information?
[01:11:09.094 --> 01:11:18.881]  I know where you're at, Roger, as well, and how do people support you with the congressional subpoenas and the IRS attacks and everything they're doing, because they see you as a prize.
[01:11:19.522 --> 01:11:25.326]  If they can take you out, the left is going to run around like they've captured a Roman standard, celebrating that they're winning.
[01:11:25.986 --> 01:11:29.169]  Taking us down is very important to the satanic New World Order.
[01:11:30.652 --> 01:11:31.654]  Alex, you're absolutely right.
[01:11:31.714 --> 01:11:35.819]  They don't want me or you on the ramparts leading this fight.
[01:11:37.321 --> 01:11:39.484]  I have to comment on that clip you just showed.
[01:11:40.025 --> 01:11:46.293]  The idea of anyone from the New York Times accusing us of being conspiracy theorists is laughable.
[01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.403]  I mean, first of all, Peter Baker works for the New York Times, so New York Times.
[01:11:50.443 --> 01:11:54.626]  Therefore, by definition, literally nothing he says is true or accurate.
[01:11:54.686 --> 01:12:06.896]  But just to remind you, he was one of the major progenitors of the Russian collusion hoax, which we now know, based on declassified documents, never took place.
[01:12:07.297 --> 01:12:11.060]  Peter, waiting for your apology, waiting for your retraction.
[01:12:12.405 --> 01:12:15.468]  It's absurd for them to call us conspiracy theorists.
[01:12:15.808 --> 01:12:17.330]  It's right out of the Alinsky book.
[01:12:17.730 --> 01:12:19.332]  They are the ones who are conspiracy theorists.
[01:12:19.472 --> 01:12:19.812]  That's right.
[01:12:19.893 --> 01:12:23.957]  I just want to up front, Roger, because I know you hadn't been a big lobbyist for 25 years.
[01:12:23.997 --> 01:12:24.998]  You were a book author.
[01:12:25.618 --> 01:12:26.439]  You lost your house.
[01:12:26.459 --> 01:12:27.180]  You lost everything.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:27.941]  You're not a victim.
[01:12:27.981 --> 01:12:31.765]  You're a champion that we've got to keep in the game and keep in the fight.
[01:12:32.225 --> 01:12:35.805]   as you know, like the equivalent of a top quarterback that's played 30 seasons.
[01:12:35.805 --> 01:12:37.704]  It's like impossible, 40 seasons.
[01:12:37.704 --> 01:12:39.345]  I've been in this 28 seasons.
[01:12:39.345 --> 01:12:42.105]  So you've been in it all, what, 45, 50 seasons.
[01:12:42.105 --> 01:12:43.584]  How do people support you?
[01:12:43.584 --> 01:12:46.105]  How do people keep you in the game?
[01:12:46.105 --> 01:12:52.625]   Well, not only do I have the January 6th hoax to contend with, but I still have six remaining
[01:12:52.625 --> 01:12:59.545]   totally baseless harassment, but sensationalized, phony civil lawsuits,
[01:12:59.545 --> 01:13:01.944]  including one by the Biden Justice Department.
[01:13:01.944 --> 01:13:06.944]  You can go to stonedefensefund.com, stonedefensefund.com.
[01:13:06.705 --> 01:13:12.211]  Unfortunately, I do still need the help of Patriots and the Infra Warrior community.
[01:13:12.231 --> 01:13:12.932]  Well, that's right, Roger.
[01:13:12.952 --> 01:13:16.996]  I mean, I know you're down to one half-broken car, and I don't want to embarrass you, but that's what's going on.
[01:13:17.316 --> 01:13:19.259]  Let's expand on this, because we're not bitching, folks.
[01:13:19.279 --> 01:13:20.480]  You've got to keep the Warriors in the fight.
[01:13:21.169 --> 01:13:26.111]  You forgot, you have the Capitol Police suing you for running January 6th!
[01:13:26.211 --> 01:13:27.492]  I mean, you had nothing to do with it!
[01:13:27.952 --> 01:13:36.176]  And people are like, well, just don't... Folks, they come at you with... Georgetown University and the CIA are suing me, okay?
[01:13:36.556 --> 01:13:39.898]  They admittedly run the law clinic, the Virginia lawsuit against us.
[01:13:39.938 --> 01:13:40.999]  This is not a frickin' game.
[01:13:41.739 --> 01:13:43.520]  And we understand it's all rigged.
[01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:45.581]  We've just got to fight through the whole process.
[01:13:46.824 --> 01:13:48.145]  Or they'd shut us down right now.
[01:13:48.225 --> 01:13:53.089]  They would send in the local constables and literally take the equipment and turn our lights off.
[01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.670]  Okay?
[01:13:53.690 --> 01:14:00.696]  I had to fight right through the crooked thing, right through the rigged courts, right through battling for years in the courts, and all of this just to stay on the air.
[01:14:01.056 --> 01:14:08.262]  We know it's all rigged, but while they're biting us and attacking us and clawing at us like gremlins, we just stay in the fight with our guns, blasting at the New World Order.
[01:14:08.682 --> 01:14:09.663]  Sorry, Roger, I'm ranting.
[01:14:10.904 --> 01:14:11.765]  That's perfectly right.
[01:14:11.865 --> 01:14:29.820]   Alex, at the very top, This morning I spoke at the River Church in Tampa with Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown who asked me to tell you of his high regard for you and the fact that he is praying for you specifically because he knows exactly what kind of attack you're under.
[01:14:30.141 --> 01:14:35.524]   So I want to pass on his Well, God bless you, and I apologize for getting you on on Sunday night and making you sit there 10 minutes while I ran it.
[01:14:35.784 --> 01:14:41.688]  You'll have the floor, I promise, on Russia, on the canvassing about election fraud that you've discovered.
[01:14:41.948 --> 01:14:42.528]  It's big news.
[01:14:42.548 --> 01:14:43.609]  You'll have it when we all come back.
[01:14:43.949 --> 01:14:50.873]  I just wanted to up front let listeners know that they don't normally hear me at the start of an interview call for support, but it's that damn serious.
[01:14:50.994 --> 01:14:52.134]  We aren't going to back down.
[01:14:52.374 --> 01:14:54.436]  We aren't going to give up, but we could give out, Roger.
[01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:55.657]  So how do people support you again?
[01:14:56.618 --> 01:14:58.341]  Roger Stone, did nothing wrong shirt.
[01:14:58.402 --> 01:14:59.324]  How do they get your books?
[01:14:59.364 --> 01:15:00.486]  How do they find Roger Stone?
[01:15:01.087 --> 01:15:02.511]  Paraphernalia, as the left calls it.
[01:15:03.372 --> 01:15:06.580]  Again, you can go to StoneColdTruth.com, go to the shop.
[01:15:07.304 --> 01:15:09.285]  StoneColdTruth.com, go to the shop.
[01:15:09.665 --> 01:15:20.068]  You can get your iconic Roger Stone Did Nothing Wrong t-shirt, or you can get a signed presidential pardon, or you can get one of my famous Roger Stones paperweights.
[01:15:20.769 --> 01:15:27.631]  Or, if you just want to help me in the legal battle, and I need the help, you can go to StoneDefenseFund.com.
[01:15:28.071 --> 01:15:30.052]  But also, you've heard me say this before.
[01:15:30.732 --> 01:15:33.693]  InfoWars is indeed the tip of the spear.
[01:15:34.113 --> 01:15:37.975]  InfoWars drives the left crazy because we adhere to the truth.
[01:15:38.255 --> 01:15:40.315]  So get over there to the InfoWars store.
[01:15:40.796 --> 01:15:45.317]  By the way, that iodine product I believe helped bring me back from the Chinese virus.
[01:15:45.797 --> 01:15:47.918]  It's the best iodine product out there.
[01:15:48.218 --> 01:15:49.238]  It's back in stock.
[01:15:49.319 --> 01:15:50.219]  That's the good news.
[01:15:50.519 --> 01:15:52.440]  Go online right now and buy it.
[01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:53.400]  Absolutely, folks.
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:55.020]  You'll find a better iodine product out there.
[01:15:55.121 --> 01:15:57.561]  We're doing our most important work yet and you are keeping us on air.
[01:15:57.581 --> 01:15:58.822]  We'll be right back with the hardcore news.
[01:15:58.842 --> 01:15:59.222]  Stay with us.
[01:16:00.865 --> 01:16:04.568]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[01:16:05.148 --> 01:16:09.251]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing.
[01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:12.633]  And so many people are deficient in iodide.
[01:16:12.653 --> 01:16:13.914]  It's not in the soil anymore.
[01:16:14.535 --> 01:16:16.056]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.
[01:16:16.576 --> 01:16:27.046]  But when you get high-quality triiodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly, your immune system.
[01:16:27.126 --> 01:16:36.835]  So, X3, the only triiodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:16:37.255 --> 01:16:44.482]   If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to kick in on average, You really need to experience X3.
[01:16:44.522 --> 01:16:47.685]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[01:16:48.185 --> 01:16:57.714]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body, it's the good halogen, not the bad halogen, and it funds the Info Award, a true 360 win.
[01:16:58.015 --> 01:17:01.518]  So again, X3, back in stock, 50% off for a limited time.
[01:17:01.638 --> 01:17:04.119]  UN-run contact tracers aren't coming.
[01:17:04.279 --> 01:17:04.839]  They're here.
[01:17:05.179 --> 01:17:09.320]  All over the world, from Australia to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:19.502]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do, everywhere you go, and then coming to your house and threatening, in some cases actually, taking people away into the night to their facilities.
[01:17:19.902 --> 01:17:28.124]  And they're planning in the next year to expand their shield process, where they come and take, quote, healthy people away and put them in facilities for their safety.
[01:17:28.484 --> 01:17:30.006]  This is nothing less than martial law.
[01:17:30.306 --> 01:17:37.975]  And one big thing you can do to fight back is to get high quality Faraday cages, many of which are made here in America and are very compliant, meaning U.S.
[01:17:38.095 --> 01:17:41.299]  government military grade at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:20:07.283 --> 01:20:08.983]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:35.682 --> 01:20:41.443]   Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday, February 6th broadcast.
[01:20:41.484 --> 01:20:48.432]  Long time Republican political operative, former top political advisor to President Trump.
[01:20:49.269 --> 01:21:23.876]   Famously pardoned for a crime he didn't commit by President Trump joins us now and he's got a lot to say from his research and his contacts and he is working for multiple administrations about what he really thinks is happening with this Russia crisis that we saw Bloomberg on Friday announced that Russia had attacked and later say sorry fake headline we've seen the State Department and CIA say just trust us we know they're gonna attack themselves and we say give us proof and they said that is the proof so they've gone from Colin Powell, who'd hold up anthrax, at least he'd show some fake anthrax.
[01:21:23.916 --> 01:21:27.498]  That was a lie, but at least he showed some type of prop.
[01:21:27.898 --> 01:21:32.241]  Here, they're not even bothering to try to plant something or make something up.
[01:21:32.522 --> 01:21:37.385]  Roger Stone, what's your view on the situation, and how imminent do you think war is, or can it be averted?
[01:21:38.891 --> 01:21:41.532]  Well, Alex, I'm going to tell you the stone-cold truth.
[01:21:41.932 --> 01:21:42.832]  I know how this works.
[01:21:42.912 --> 01:21:50.715]  As soon as I tell you what's really going on, the fake news media is going to say, oh, Roger Stone and Alex Jones, they're puppets for Putin.
[01:21:50.735 --> 01:21:52.095]  They're Russian spokesmen.
[01:21:52.455 --> 01:21:54.296]  They're Russian traitors.
[01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:54.536]  No.
[01:21:55.236 --> 01:22:00.238]  My family members were mowed down by Russian tanks in Budapest in 1956.
[01:22:00.778 --> 01:22:03.339]  I abhor the Russian system.
[01:22:03.419 --> 01:22:07.200]  It's a brutal totalitarian system.
[01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:20.031]   However, This rush to war in which the Biden administration is going to endanger hundreds of thousands of lives, Americans, Russians, Ukrainians, is completely avertable.
[01:22:20.712 --> 01:22:32.504]   They would like us to believe That Putin wants to take over all of Ukraine and install a puppet government so that he can restore the fated glory of the great Soviet Union.
[01:22:32.985 --> 01:22:35.846]  First of all, he can't even economically afford that.
[01:22:36.307 --> 01:22:42.311]  Secondarily, let us listen to what he is saying over and over and over again.
[01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:51.637]  When he says he doesn't want Ukraine to join NATO, what he is saying is he doesn't want Western missiles on his border.
[01:22:52.498 --> 01:23:03.409]  This is identical to what President John F. Kennedy said in 1962 when he said he did not want Russian missiles 90 miles off the shore of the United States.
[01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:06.232]  This is all about that.
[01:23:06.372 --> 01:23:12.438]  And he said it over and over again, but that gets extrapolated to he wants to take over Ukraine.
[01:23:12.818 --> 01:23:13.659]  I don't believe so.
[01:23:14.424 --> 01:23:24.293]  If Ukraine would merely agree, essentially, not to put missiles on the border of Russia, this entire thing could be averted.
[01:23:24.574 --> 01:23:25.895]  By the way, that's what happened in 1962.
[01:23:27.496 --> 01:23:33.382]  John Kennedy basically got the Russians, he made a pledge not to invade Cuba.
[01:23:33.802 --> 01:23:45.130]   In return, they agreed to And back then they showed us the photos of the missiles and the weapons and the Russians got embarrassed and had to admit it.
[01:23:45.150 --> 01:23:46.751]  Here we're given no proof.
[01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:49.190]  and massive deaths were averted.
[01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:54.490]   And back then they showed us the photos of the missiles and the weapons
[01:23:54.490 --> 01:23:56.291]  and the Russians got embarrassed and had to admit it.
[01:23:56.291 --> 01:23:57.690]  Here we're given no proof.
[01:23:57.690 --> 01:24:02.090]   And again, this is our weapons in the Russian theater, not the other way around.
[01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:04.591]  Well, but let's also be clear about what's going on here.
[01:24:04.591 --> 01:24:05.591]  This is...
[01:24:05.635 --> 01:24:07.697]  This is one of the all-time classics.
[01:24:07.937 --> 01:24:09.438]  It's diversion.
[01:24:10.239 --> 01:24:12.720]  Don't look over here at what the Chinese are doing.
[01:24:13.341 --> 01:24:17.824]  Don't look at the way they've corrupted the first family and the way they have paid Hunter Biden.
[01:24:18.464 --> 01:24:24.709]  Don't look at the way they are systematically buying up farmland and real estate all over America.
[01:24:25.498 --> 01:24:25.919]  The U.S.
[01:24:25.939 --> 01:24:31.029]  Department of Agriculture estimated that they had several hundred thousand acres.
[01:24:31.591 --> 01:24:36.922]  Alex, they have 300,000 of ranch and farmland in Oklahoma alone.
[01:24:37.927 --> 01:24:40.868]  So, don't look at the way they're manipulating our currency.
[01:24:41.388 --> 01:24:46.370]  Don't look at the way they are threatening our American flag vessels in the South China Sea.
[01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:49.712]  No, no, look over here at Russia and Ukraine.
[01:24:50.052 --> 01:24:51.292]  This is a diversion.
[01:24:52.133 --> 01:25:02.937]  They are on the precipice of a horrific war that would be avertable through diplomacy if anybody would just listen to what Putin is saying.
[01:25:03.573 --> 01:25:05.534]  But instead, you have the drums of war.
[01:25:05.894 --> 01:25:07.475]  It's bipartisan, by the way.
[01:25:07.796 --> 01:25:09.497]  It's Republicans and Democrats.
[01:25:09.557 --> 01:25:16.181]  It's the same neocons who would lead us to a totally unnecessary war.
[01:25:16.601 --> 01:25:18.662]  No, I'm not an apologist for Putin.
[01:25:18.982 --> 01:25:20.823]  No, I don't like the Russian system.
[01:25:21.404 --> 01:25:25.827]  But I do think that war is avertable here, if through diplomacy.
[01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:28.088]  On the other hand, here's the backdrop.
[01:25:29.301 --> 01:25:36.225]  Only yesterday they announced that all of the sanctions Donald Trump put in place against Iran have been lifted.
[01:25:36.965 --> 01:26:02.684]   So every time we show the world weakness in our foreign policy, well, Iraq is raining missiles on Israel, the North Koreans have restarted their nuclear weapons development program, The Russians are obviously on the border here prepared to make a move because they don't think that we will take their insistence of not putting missiles on their border seriously.
[01:26:03.496 --> 01:26:09.360]  You have, as I said earlier, the Chinese harassing American flagships in the South China Sea.
[01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:12.862]  That would never happen under President Donald Trump.
[01:26:13.223 --> 01:26:19.407]  And then, of course, you have the fiasco in Afghanistan, where we were correct to remove our troops.
[01:26:19.887 --> 01:26:28.093]  That's a continuation of a Trump administration policy, removing our troops from the endless foreign wars where we have no inherent interest.
[01:26:28.633 --> 01:26:39.844]  But we left behind 86 billion dollars worth of sophisticated military equipment, making Iran the fourth best equipped military on the face of the planet.
[01:26:39.864 --> 01:26:41.245]  And let me just go back to what you just said.
[01:26:41.949 --> 01:26:58.137]  The State Department is showing $5 billion in a bunch of different shipments in the last month, being delivered every week with Javelin missiles, anti-tank missiles, anti-aircraft missiles, really class A weapons, are being delivered en masse.
[01:26:58.157 --> 01:26:58.777]  And we know U.S.
[01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:00.938]  Special Forces are there, because I know some of the guys that are there.
[01:27:01.638 --> 01:27:07.781]  Already in proxy wars, the Little Green Men, 14,000 people already killed in the east of Ukraine in this proxy war.
[01:27:08.182 --> 01:27:11.163]  And so clearly the West is accelerating the conflict.
[01:27:11.881 --> 01:27:19.046]  I think as a political distraction, as you said, from China, from Iran, from Afghanistan, and also the election coming up, the midterms.
[01:27:20.907 --> 01:27:23.088]  I think that's exactly on the money.
[01:27:23.248 --> 01:27:29.913]  At this point, my sources in the Pentagon, and I still have some, tell me that they doubt war can be averted.
[01:27:30.333 --> 01:27:34.916]  They are hell-bent on war, but it is based on a false premise.
[01:27:36.025 --> 01:27:41.587]  This could be diverted via diplomatic relations and diplomatic negotiations.
[01:27:42.207 --> 01:27:48.610]  I think Putin could not be more clear that he just doesn't want Western missiles on his border.
[01:27:49.130 --> 01:28:00.594]  So it is the same big government, Democrat media cabal now beating the drum for war.
[01:28:00.674 --> 01:28:01.915]  They are war happy.
[01:28:02.635 --> 01:28:05.056]  And maybe people will forget about the energy prices.
[01:28:05.569 --> 01:28:13.140]  Maybe people forget about what they're paying at the gas pump since we had absolute energy independence under President Trump.
[01:28:13.461 --> 01:28:16.685]  And now we're back to buying oil from who?
[01:28:16.906 --> 01:28:18.668]  The Russians and the Saudis.
[01:28:18.849 --> 01:28:19.630]  Gee, how about that?
[01:28:20.928 --> 01:28:22.189]  This is just insane.
[01:28:22.269 --> 01:28:25.671]  And of course, who benefits the globalist from destabilization?
[01:28:25.691 --> 01:28:32.396]  So they go from the Great Reset with the two years of COVID lockdown into a new war with supply chains breaking down even faster.
[01:28:32.936 --> 01:28:34.877]  A whole bunch of Ford plants are now closing.
[01:28:35.538 --> 01:28:39.340]  Eight, maybe forever they're saying, due to persistent supply chain disruptions.
[01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:43.403]  That's not from the virus, it's from the hysteria and the lockdowns from the virus.
[01:28:43.643 --> 01:28:46.665]  We're going to come back with Roger Stone and talk more about the upcoming election.
[01:28:47.245 --> 01:28:55.189]  And massive election fraud and all sorts of other chicanery which is being very well documented and that is now unfolding.
[01:28:55.249 --> 01:28:55.749]  Stay with us.
[01:28:55.869 --> 01:28:57.130]  InfoWars.com.
[01:28:57.430 --> 01:28:58.431]  Tomorrow's news today.

[01:29:12.907 --> 01:29:14.188]  It's not in the soil anymore.
[01:29:14.809 --> 01:29:16.350]  Most of the ocean is contaminated.

[01:30:02.117 --> 01:30:08.362]  In my 28 years on air, Reset Wars is the most important information I have ever put out.
[01:30:09.249 --> 01:30:15.314]  And since we released it in the middle of December 2021, about a month and a half ago, there has been debanking.
[01:30:15.354 --> 01:30:17.495]  There has been blocking of the video streams.
[01:30:17.996 --> 01:30:19.977]  There has been attacks on the email servers.
[01:30:19.997 --> 01:30:24.220]  There has been unprecedented attempts to shut this down.
[01:30:24.941 --> 01:30:30.085]  And as much of a pain in the neck that is, and as much as I don't like it, it lets me know I'm over the target.
[01:30:30.105 --> 01:30:38.651]  The old World War II saying when the bombers knew they were over the German troops or the German factories or the Allied factories was because that's where they were getting the flack.
[01:30:39.051 --> 01:30:41.393]  That's where the anti-aircraft guns were shooting at them.
[01:30:42.194 --> 01:30:45.656]  And so my mission is to steer into the flack and take on the globalists.
[01:30:45.696 --> 01:30:48.178]  And they are so afraid of recent wars.
[01:30:48.238 --> 01:31:05.252]  And because of their censorship, and because of the fact they're scared of this getting to the general public, this mind-spirit technology, to just be aware of the globalists and how they operate and their tricks, and to be aware of the fact that the universe is much larger and that God's there literally reaching out to you through free will.
[01:31:06.735 --> 01:31:10.696]  They are doing everything they can to block this information.
[01:31:11.116 --> 01:31:20.439]  So because of all their attempts to censor it and block it, we're offering it at 50% off for the first time and probably the only time ever.

[01:31:28.904 --> 01:31:29.765]  They want you depressed.
[01:31:29.785 --> 01:31:32.206]  They want you to feel like you're trapped in your five senses.
[01:31:32.626 --> 01:31:36.608]  They don't want you to know about the sixth sense, or what a lot of the ancients called the third eye.
[01:31:37.389 --> 01:31:37.849]  It's there.
[01:31:38.369 --> 01:31:38.869]  It's real.
[01:31:39.229 --> 01:31:49.415]  And this only gets you to focus with exercises and research and history and prayer to reconnect with the sixth sense, which is the conduit to the divine and God.
[01:31:49.975 --> 01:31:52.457]  Ladies and gentlemen, they do not want you to have Reset Wars.

[01:33:08.649 --> 01:33:19.930]  You're listening to a front line report with Roger Stone.
[01:33:19.930 --> 01:33:22.510]  (upbeat music)
[01:33:23.482 --> 01:33:27.465]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:28.006 --> 01:33:29.347]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:30.473 --> 01:33:32.915]  You know, we get new crew in here sometimes over the years.
[01:33:32.935 --> 01:33:34.015]  We got the best crew ever.
[01:33:35.256 --> 01:33:42.060]  And people will ask me, they're like, hey, you came in, you were dragging, and then you went in your office for an hour, and you came out.
[01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.581]  Are you using drugs?
[01:33:44.422 --> 01:33:48.464]  How the hell do you get so excited once you're on air, but you're not when you come in here?
[01:33:49.585 --> 01:33:59.191]  And then they get to know me and learn, no, I'm excited because the world's exciting, and exciting things are going on, and they're trying to start nuclear war with Russia, and we could all die.
[01:33:59.901 --> 01:34:07.248]  And it'd take a few months after the fallout, you know, as our gums bleed out and our guts bleed out, and I don't want to be there with my dying children.
[01:34:07.688 --> 01:34:10.370]  You know, I'd like to not blow up this planet we're on.
[01:34:11.371 --> 01:34:13.133]  See, I'm excited about things that matter.
[01:34:13.153 --> 01:34:16.296]  People say, why aren't you excited about football or basketball or baseball?
[01:34:16.456 --> 01:34:17.457]  Because those things don't matter.
[01:34:18.197 --> 01:34:22.059]  And yeah, I used to, 30 years ago, get excited about it, but now I know that's a diversion.
[01:34:22.239 --> 01:34:27.302]  And I'm not judging you if you like that, but people paint their faces up and they yell and scream at football games.
[01:34:27.762 --> 01:34:32.124]  I get up here on air and yell and scream trying to stop a new giant war.
[01:34:32.284 --> 01:34:34.325]  I mean, we have collapsing cities.
[01:34:34.365 --> 01:34:35.946]  We have massive inflation.
[01:34:35.966 --> 01:34:38.287]  We have things degenerating everywhere.
[01:34:38.307 --> 01:34:39.888]  We have incredible fentanyl deaths.
[01:34:40.348 --> 01:34:44.390]  I mean, I know a whole bunch of people whose teenagers have died in Austin.
[01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:55.770]  I don't just read it in the newspaper where they find some 11-year-old with 100 bags of fentanyl in New Haven, Connecticut, who's dead from fentanyl, and two of his other friends almost died, and they're in middle school.
[01:34:56.871 --> 01:34:58.272]  That's what pisses me off.
[01:34:58.552 --> 01:35:01.655]  And Roger Stone's angry about it as well, and he's fired up.
[01:35:02.076 --> 01:35:03.857]  And we want to get you fired up in that fight.
[01:35:04.438 --> 01:35:07.180]  And we know you're tuned in because you are fired up.
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:09.102]  We've got to get other people fired up.
[01:35:09.122 --> 01:35:10.704]  And that's starting to happen.
[01:35:11.477 --> 01:35:15.099]  Roger, finishing up on the Russian situation, what can listeners do?
[01:35:15.159 --> 01:35:16.280]  What can citizens do?
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.621]  Be like Josh Hawley?
[01:35:17.681 --> 01:35:18.761]  Be like Tucker Carlson?
[01:35:19.522 --> 01:35:21.083]  Call out the neocon Republicans?
[01:35:21.123 --> 01:35:23.944]  I mean, because they're saying, it's imminent, get ready.
[01:35:24.465 --> 01:35:25.905]  Clearly they want to go to war at any time.
[01:35:25.945 --> 01:35:29.467]  They want to use an attack on the Russians to then say they false flagged themselves.
[01:35:29.507 --> 01:35:32.329]  I mean, this is just a disaster we're facing.
[01:35:32.649 --> 01:35:34.590]  And then people ask me, why are you so upset?
[01:35:34.610 --> 01:35:35.671]  It's just crazy.
[01:35:36.872 --> 01:35:39.354]  You know, Alex, you just put up an extraordinary story.
[01:35:39.434 --> 01:35:47.622]  Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi says we're not ruling out a first nuclear strike over Ukraine.
[01:35:48.342 --> 01:35:49.744]  This is just beyond belief.
[01:35:50.244 --> 01:35:59.012]  No, I think that people need to let their senators and their congressmen know that they are not foregoing to war when war can be averted.
[01:35:59.696 --> 01:36:03.018]  This is a dangerous game that the Biden administration is playing.
[01:36:03.318 --> 01:36:06.780]  This could result in hundreds of thousands of deaths.
[01:36:08.121 --> 01:36:10.122]  And it is entirely unnecessary.
[01:36:10.162 --> 01:36:18.307]  Now, I understand that we are going to be attacked relentlessly after this broadcast as Russian stooges, Russian spies.
[01:36:19.108 --> 01:36:25.812]  No, we love America and we don't want to go to war unless our inherent national interests are present.
[01:36:26.192 --> 01:36:27.573]  They are not present here.
[01:36:28.453 --> 01:36:34.180]  Can you imagine the Biden administration saying this is about borders, protecting the Ukrainian border?
[01:36:34.521 --> 01:36:36.843]  What about America's border?
[01:36:37.785 --> 01:36:39.547]  We saw last week in Florida.
[01:36:40.194 --> 01:36:44.357]  Two luxury buses in Maitland, Florida, pull up to a hotel.
[01:36:44.697 --> 01:36:51.181]  We saw a number of illegal immigrants, all, by the way, males, somewhere between 18 and 25 by and large.
[01:36:51.642 --> 01:36:55.184]  Each one of them being given preloaded credit cards.
[01:36:55.624 --> 01:36:59.627]  Each one of them being given a passcode for a room in a hotel.
[01:37:00.208 --> 01:37:06.372]  Well, by law, you can't get a room in a hotel unless you can show a driver's license or some other legal ID.
[01:37:07.172 --> 01:37:08.193]  How is this happening?
[01:37:08.857 --> 01:37:22.307]  Our great governor, Ron DeSantis, specifically said that if the Biden administration sent illegals to this state, he would send them packing to Delaware and California, where Biden and Kamala Harris are from.
[01:37:22.868 --> 01:37:24.649]  And I'd like to see him keep that pledge.
[01:37:25.279 --> 01:37:38.697]  We've already seen evidence that they are flying illegals from Afghanistan, Afghani refugees into Jacksonville, Florida, because unfortunately one of them went out and murdered an American citizen.
[01:37:39.531 --> 01:37:44.258]  So, again, I call on our governor to walk the walk.
[01:37:44.318 --> 01:37:45.881]  Don't just talk the talk.
[01:37:46.682 --> 01:37:48.685]  We cannot have this flow of illegals.
[01:37:48.705 --> 01:37:49.065]  I agree.
[01:37:49.106 --> 01:37:51.990]  He's got to deport them all to Martha's Vineyard now.
[01:37:52.050 --> 01:37:52.911]  That's a great idea.
[01:37:53.152 --> 01:37:55.315]  He must deport them to Martha's Vineyard.
[01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.061]  I'm all for it.
[01:37:59.441 --> 01:38:07.464]  But in the meantime, I spoke to a great conference yesterday in Tampa, put on by Defend Florida.
[01:38:07.884 --> 01:38:16.108]  And Alex, there's just no question, there are 1.6 million phantom voters on the Florida voter rolls.
[01:38:16.168 --> 01:38:18.428]  Now, if you don't live in Florida, why should you care?
[01:38:18.669 --> 01:38:19.909]  I'll tell you why you should care.
[01:38:20.349 --> 01:38:24.991]  Because no Republican will be elected President of the United States without carrying the Sunshine State.
[01:38:25.586 --> 01:38:32.191]  This is the most important swing state, and it's the state that Donald Trump did best of, of all the swing states.
[01:38:32.591 --> 01:38:36.013]  So it's not that there wasn't voter fraud in the last election in Florida.
[01:38:36.474 --> 01:38:37.014]  There was.
[01:38:37.675 --> 01:38:39.236]  They just didn't steal enough.
[01:38:39.776 --> 01:38:48.242]  They did not foresee Donald Trump coming out of Miami-Dade County, the southernmost county in the state, the largest county in the state, even.
[01:38:48.863 --> 01:38:50.804]  No Republican comes out of there even.
[01:38:51.423 --> 01:38:59.070]  Generally speaking, you want to lose that county 60-40, and if you do, you're going to win statewide by getting the normal Republican vote.
[01:38:59.411 --> 01:39:18.817]   And Roger, explain, because we saw this in Texas and Florida, where they had a pool of dead people voting, they had a pool of people that were out of state still voting, and as soon as they ran out of that pool, suddenly You didn't see in the last election the numbers tracking the same in 2020 and then suddenly Trump surges ahead.
[01:39:18.878 --> 01:39:27.204]  So we're seeing this over and over again and we saw in California large portions of Republicans going and trying to vote and somebody had already voted in their name.
[01:39:28.285 --> 01:39:29.406]  Yeah, there's no question.
[01:39:29.446 --> 01:39:30.727]  This is pretty easy to prove.
[01:39:31.447 --> 01:39:34.210]  Put aside those who voted on election day in Florida.
[01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:37.192]  Put aside those who voted by absentee ballot.
[01:39:37.884 --> 01:39:40.205]  Put aside those who voted in early voting.
[01:39:40.605 --> 01:39:43.066]  Just focus on those who voted by mail.
[01:39:43.746 --> 01:40:09.930]   Now, if you go visit 20,000 of those households, and you find that 20% of them do not exist, meaning they moved, they died, it's a vacant lot, there's no residence there, there's no evidence that they ever existed to begin with, And then you use the law of mathematical probability to project it on the millions who voted by mail-in ballot.
[01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:17.152]  You come up with the undeniable conclusion that there are over 1 million phantom voters on our rolls.
[01:40:17.633 --> 01:40:19.413]  PolitiFact says I'm wrong.
[01:40:19.493 --> 01:40:21.374]  No, I say they're wrong.
[01:40:21.734 --> 01:40:23.154]  They're denying math.
[01:40:23.494 --> 01:40:25.095]  Bad enough when they deny science.
[01:40:25.455 --> 01:40:26.955]  Now they're denying math.
[01:40:27.215 --> 01:40:28.856]  This is simple math.
[01:40:29.463 --> 01:40:38.986]  So we need an audit of our election rolls, not because Donald Trump lost the state, but because we are drowning in voters that don't exist.
[01:40:39.466 --> 01:40:41.186]  This isn't just happening in Florida.
[01:40:41.466 --> 01:40:42.707]  It's happened in Arizona.
[01:40:43.047 --> 01:40:44.187]  It's happened in Georgia.
[01:40:44.467 --> 01:40:46.788]  We saw a story last week, undeniable.
[01:40:47.088 --> 01:40:53.010]  There's over 100,000 voters in Wisconsin who voted in the last election who are all over 100 years old.
[01:40:54.975 --> 01:40:55.716]  Not possible.
[01:40:56.096 --> 01:40:56.797]  Not possible.
[01:40:57.377 --> 01:41:03.002]  You know, this is a huge dichotomy between the grassroots and the leaders of the Republican Party.
[01:41:03.522 --> 01:41:07.966]  The leaders of the party, the rhinos, they want this issue to go away.
[01:41:08.046 --> 01:41:16.953]  But at the grassroots, I can tell you, it is first and foremost on the minds of Republican voters, and they get reminded of it every time they go to the gas pump.
[01:41:17.552 --> 01:41:23.156]  Or every time they read about our leaving $86 billion worth of equipment in Afghanistan.
[01:41:23.316 --> 01:41:24.577]  I totally agree, Roger.
[01:41:25.097 --> 01:41:26.899]  Let me show you the numbers from Texas and Florida.
[01:41:26.919 --> 01:41:27.999]  I know you're a political expert.
[01:41:28.860 --> 01:41:29.621]  And I mean, I'm not.
[01:41:29.641 --> 01:41:30.361]  I've just seen the numbers.
[01:41:30.381 --> 01:41:31.622]  I want your take as we got a break on this.
[01:41:32.022 --> 01:41:34.024]  Here's a simple little graph I just drew.
[01:41:34.324 --> 01:41:36.385]  If you look at Florida and Texas, you have the voter rolls.
[01:41:36.886 --> 01:41:38.046]  And it's the same graph.
[01:41:38.086 --> 01:41:41.589]  Trump wins and just keeps going through in the night.
[01:41:42.049 --> 01:41:50.723]   But with Biden in Florida and in Texas, It just keeps tracking right next to Trump, because they want to be able to, right at the end, put an extra and go above him, and then suddenly it just ends!
[01:41:51.083 --> 01:41:53.104]  And suddenly there's, like, no more voters and it drops off!
[01:41:53.364 --> 01:41:54.965]  Which, again, you don't see graphs like that.
[01:41:55.185 --> 01:42:05.230]  That in Pennsylvania, Georgia, and other areas, it's the other way, where Trump's here, Biden's here, they wait, they have plenty of votes, and they steal it in the middle of the night, and then go straight up to where they need to be.
[01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:08.492]  So, I mean, these graphs you don't see unless there's fraud, correct?
[01:42:09.341 --> 01:42:10.322]  That's exactly right.
[01:42:10.422 --> 01:42:12.122]  Look, in Pennsylvania, it's very simple.
[01:42:12.483 --> 01:42:21.227]  It was the Republicans who legalized mail-in ballots, which are specifically unconstitutional under their state constitution.
[01:42:21.907 --> 01:42:23.528]  So the RINOs did it to themselves.
[01:42:23.568 --> 01:42:28.590]  See, they were so sure that Donald Trump was going to lose Pennsylvania, they were trying to save themselves.
[01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:31.111]  But Donald Trump ended up running way ahead of them.
[01:42:31.491 --> 01:42:32.732]  I believe he carried the state.
[01:42:33.650 --> 01:42:34.151]  Absolutely.
[01:42:34.191 --> 01:42:35.872]  All right, final segment with Roger Stone.
[01:42:35.992 --> 01:42:38.394]  I want to get into the midterms more.
[01:42:38.474 --> 01:42:44.159]  I want to talk about January 6, because even all the big Republicans admit they go to events with thousands of people, hundreds of people.
[01:42:44.319 --> 01:42:45.560]  No one wants to hear about Jan 6.
[01:42:46.101 --> 01:42:49.824]  They care about inflation, imploding borders, and the incompetence of Biden, and war.
[01:42:50.124 --> 01:42:50.965]  They don't want war.
[01:42:51.225 --> 01:42:52.006]  They want jobs.
[01:42:52.046 --> 01:42:52.927]  They want security.
[01:42:53.207 --> 01:42:53.967]  They want a future.
[01:42:54.248 --> 01:42:55.449]  Same thing with Democrat voters.
[01:42:55.729 --> 01:42:58.671]  So what are the Democrats going to do when they're running on Jan 6?
[01:43:01.448 --> 01:43:10.332]  Ladies and gentlemen, it has been four years since My Patriot Supply allowed us to do 25% off on food sales.
[01:43:10.492 --> 01:43:12.252]  Now, they have the food ready to ship.
[01:43:12.413 --> 01:43:13.533]  It's super high quality.
[01:43:13.593 --> 01:43:16.914]  It's the lowest price you're going to find anywhere for food of this quality.
[01:43:16.954 --> 01:43:23.877]  It's what I use, what my family used, what I've stockpiled here at the office, because I know the globalists want a post-industrial world and want to collapse civilization.
[01:43:23.957 --> 01:43:30.380]  And if they're able to do it, we've got to have generators and diesel and food and everything, which we have.
[01:43:30.580 --> 01:43:35.621]  But a lot of you obviously don't have the money or the places to store stuff like this, but storable food you do.
[01:43:35.781 --> 01:43:37.762]  Put it in the attic, put it in the basement, put it in the closet.
[01:43:37.882 --> 01:43:44.683]  They bought massive amounts of food last year and this year because they saw the prices going way up with inflation, which did happen.
[01:43:44.783 --> 01:43:51.465]  But literally, only for our viewers and listeners, they are doing a once in three or four year deal of 25% off.
[01:43:52.805 --> 01:43:55.146]  Only for InfoWarsTore.com shoppers.
[01:43:55.166 --> 01:44:00.729]  You can also go to preparewithalex.com and that will take you as a URL straight to the subpage of InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:44:00.869 --> 01:44:04.391]  All their specialty foods, all of their products, 25% off.
[01:44:04.411 --> 01:44:08.994]  And what's great is we normally only make 25-30% on the food because there's not a lot of markup.
[01:44:09.034 --> 01:44:09.614]  They make 20-30%, we make 20-30%.
[01:44:11.175 --> 01:44:12.016]  That's why they're affordable.
[01:44:12.036 --> 01:44:14.157]  They're not doing 200%, 300% markup.
[01:44:14.177 --> 01:44:16.559]  They're doing 100% and then trying to pay their bills with it.
[01:44:16.599 --> 01:44:18.881]  That's why they become dominant, because the price again is so low.
[01:44:19.081 --> 01:44:23.664]  But they are eating the 25% discount and not taking it out of ours.
[01:44:23.684 --> 01:44:28.708]  Because when we do discounts, part of that comes out of what we make, and we need money.
[01:44:29.228 --> 01:44:30.269]  We don't have extra money.
[01:44:30.410 --> 01:44:31.571]  We're a little bit in the red here.
[01:44:32.011 --> 01:44:38.299]  So this is a godsend when they called and said, hey, we actually don't have a lot of extra food, but we got a little bit more than what we thought we needed.
[01:44:38.439 --> 01:44:40.361]  And we package this and ship it out when it's fresh.
[01:44:40.481 --> 01:44:42.483]  And so it literally, God laid it on our heart.
[01:44:42.563 --> 01:44:43.665]  These folks are big Christians.
[01:44:43.784 --> 01:44:48.024]   obviously big supporters, to just help you and your listeners by giving them 25% off.
[01:44:48.024 --> 01:44:51.425]  So this is exclusive to Infowarsstore.com, Ready Hour.
[01:44:51.425 --> 01:44:53.564]  They've got five big facilities around the country.
[01:44:53.564 --> 01:44:57.505]   Their main base is Utah, and we are their biggest seller as well.
[01:44:57.505 --> 01:45:01.444]   But I'm telling you, they've got a warehouse in Utah, I was at, that you could park an
[01:45:01.444 --> 01:45:02.444]  aircraft carrier in.
[01:45:02.444 --> 01:45:04.385]  So that's just the front end.
[01:45:04.385 --> 01:45:06.024]  That's just 1/20th of it.
[01:45:06.024 --> 01:45:09.463]   The whole storage facility where the raw food comes in and gets processed is the whole back
[01:45:09.463 --> 01:45:10.784]  of the building, 80% of it.
[01:45:10.784 --> 01:45:13.904]  I mean, it is the biggest building I've ever been inside of.
[01:45:13.904 --> 01:45:17.224]   So in all that stealability is how they give you these great prices.
[01:45:17.211 --> 01:45:19.913]  So, literally, Lord works mysterious ways.
[01:45:19.973 --> 01:45:24.816]  I said earlier, I'm sitting there with accountants last week going, oh, we got a $2.5 million shortfall again.
[01:45:25.396 --> 01:45:27.978]  We can't get a lot of the supplements in because the supply chain breakdown.
[01:45:27.998 --> 01:45:30.219]  People aren't going to buy $2 million worth of T-shirts.
[01:45:30.259 --> 01:45:30.920]  What am I going to do?
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:32.481]  I just sold my house.
[01:45:32.861 --> 01:45:33.641]  I'm going to put that in.
[01:45:33.661 --> 01:45:37.744]  But that was for expansion and new operations and backup systems.
[01:45:38.204 --> 01:45:38.885]  What am I going to do?
[01:45:38.905 --> 01:45:42.607]  And then boom, this just came right through and we're having massive sales.
[01:45:43.367 --> 01:45:44.628]  Biggest sales of food ever.
[01:45:44.688 --> 01:45:48.429]  People with the Russia situation, the supply chain breakdowns, all of it understand.
[01:45:48.509 --> 01:45:49.710]  Now's the time not to wait.
[01:45:49.810 --> 01:45:53.051]  One of the big things you've got to check off on that checklist of preparedness is durable food.
[01:45:53.111 --> 01:45:55.652]  They've got water filters, air filters, they're discounted too.
[01:45:55.812 --> 01:46:00.134]  Infowarsstore.com or preparewithalex.com and hopefully this sale runs through the 13th.
[01:46:01.811 --> 01:46:10.596]  Hopefully, it looks like at current sales rates, we might actually get the two and a half, three million dollars just perfectly in the sale that they called and said, you can do this for two weeks.
[01:46:11.636 --> 01:46:15.018]  So, thank you, God, and thank you, listeners, for the support, but this is something you already need.
[01:46:15.378 --> 01:46:21.381]  So it's a 360 win, and God always keeps me right on empty, though, like the widows might.
[01:46:21.561 --> 01:46:22.522]  Each day, it's renewed.
[01:46:22.562 --> 01:46:23.542]  So, thank you, Lord.
[01:46:23.782 --> 01:46:24.343]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:24.163 --> 01:46:25.163]  Stay with us.
[01:46:25.163 --> 01:46:34.163]  [Music]
[01:46:34.311 --> 01:46:35.231]  I don't even know what this is.
[01:46:35.292 --> 01:46:35.932]  How did you get here?
[01:46:37.292 --> 01:46:39.393]  I just caught you, American.
[01:46:39.713 --> 01:46:41.774]  You visited Bandar Video.
[01:46:41.794 --> 01:46:45.936]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[01:46:46.476 --> 01:46:52.038]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video or I have to hurt you.
[01:46:52.418 --> 01:46:59.441]  It comes from China.
[01:47:02.307 --> 01:47:06.412]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:06.733 --> 01:47:08.733]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.733 --> 01:47:23.733]  [Music]
[01:47:24.567 --> 01:47:29.671]  Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say.
[01:47:30.792 --> 01:47:34.675]  No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip.
[01:47:35.155 --> 01:47:38.818]  The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip.
[01:47:39.639 --> 01:47:42.141]  Big iron on his hip.
[01:47:44.355 --> 01:47:54.598]  I cannot stress enough to the listeners and viewers how brave the situation is worldwide.
[01:47:54.998 --> 01:47:56.079]  And I don't do that to scare you.
[01:47:56.139 --> 01:48:08.102]  I do that to really get everybody to understand that if we don't politically hold the neocons and the psychotic Democrats feet to the damn fire, they're going to start a major war with Russia.
[01:48:08.342 --> 01:48:09.323]  They already say it's imminent.
[01:48:10.263 --> 01:48:11.743]  This isn't Iraq, folks, okay?
[01:48:12.444 --> 01:48:13.304]  This is crazy town.
[01:48:14.799 --> 01:48:17.161]  And they're censoring everybody.
[01:48:17.401 --> 01:48:18.542]  They're debanking everybody.
[01:48:18.882 --> 01:48:27.589]  They're making major moves because the globalist, Great Reset, New World Order system is in trouble all over the world with major governments.
[01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:29.491]  People are learning about it very quickly.
[01:48:29.851 --> 01:48:32.593]  They've stolen quadrillions of money through fiat banking.
[01:48:33.194 --> 01:48:34.555]  They're crashing the system.
[01:48:35.965 --> 01:48:48.393]  They need viruses and wars and cyber attacks that they control as the diversion of the distraction to be our saviors while they actually conquer the world through financial fraud and warfare.
[01:48:49.974 --> 01:48:51.856]  That's why the learning curve on this is so important.
[01:48:51.876 --> 01:48:54.397]  But thank God, I'm seeing it everywhere now.
[01:48:54.998 --> 01:49:04.544]  Being discussed by top scientists and lawyers and major leaders and Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and all these other people now talking about the Great Reset.
[01:49:05.552 --> 01:49:07.033]  It's the corporate cabals.
[01:49:07.193 --> 01:49:08.314]  It's the other power structure.
[01:49:08.334 --> 01:49:08.854]  There's China.
[01:49:10.655 --> 01:49:11.296]  There's Russia.
[01:49:11.736 --> 01:49:12.777]  There's the United States.
[01:49:12.797 --> 01:49:13.877]  There's the European Union.
[01:49:13.897 --> 01:49:14.838]  There's the Islamists.
[01:49:15.458 --> 01:49:17.159]  But what's bigger than all that together?
[01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:20.462]  The big corporations manipulating it all above the law.
[01:49:20.502 --> 01:49:22.363]  We never think about being conquered by them.
[01:49:22.703 --> 01:49:23.744]  That's what the Great Reset is.
[01:49:23.784 --> 01:49:27.086]  So please, go to ResetWars.com today.
[01:49:28.001 --> 01:49:33.345]  It is a seven-hour course on Mind Wars, Spirit Wars, how to mentally get ready for this.
[01:49:33.705 --> 01:49:35.767]  This is real technology that God gave us.
[01:49:35.787 --> 01:49:36.928]  A lot of this is well known.
[01:49:36.968 --> 01:49:37.908]  A lot of it's not well known.
[01:49:38.248 --> 01:49:39.209]  And the course is 50% off.
[01:49:39.249 --> 01:49:41.391]  We're only running it until tomorrow.
[01:49:41.411 --> 01:49:42.612]  Then I'm going to end the 50% off.
[01:49:42.752 --> 01:49:44.433]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:49:44.993 --> 01:49:47.455]  Please go to ResetWars.com and watch the course.
[01:49:47.475 --> 01:49:49.056]  And I want to thank everybody that has gotten it.
[01:49:49.436 --> 01:49:51.358]  And everybody, please support Roger Stone.

[01:49:57.199 --> 01:50:02.569]   uh... he's he's got all these other groups after him and if you want to fight we will but we don't have george
[01:50:02.569 --> 01:50:07.459]   soros paying our bills again the best websites roger stone for folks
[01:50:07.459 --> 01:50:11.079]   to uh... be able to support you they want to keep us in the fight
[01:50:11.079 --> 01:50:15.918]   uh... stone defense fund dot com there it is stone defense fund dot com
[01:50:15.918 --> 01:50:20.339]   i still gotta fight six completely baseless harassment lawsuits
[01:50:20.339 --> 01:50:25.139]   being financed by george soros or in one case by the biden justice department
[01:50:25.541 --> 01:50:26.922]  These are civil suits.
[01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:30.743]  Business Insider said last week it was a criminal suit.
[01:50:30.803 --> 01:50:32.104]  No, these are civil suits.
[01:50:32.504 --> 01:50:33.304]  They're baseless.
[01:50:33.645 --> 01:50:37.308]  But if you don't go fight them, they get a judgment against you.
[01:50:37.328 --> 01:50:38.769]  I've already lost enough.
[01:50:39.209 --> 01:50:40.290]  Alex, I've got to be honest with you.
[01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:42.271]  I'm just happy to be back on my feet.
[01:50:42.652 --> 01:50:46.154]  Because I got bowled over by the Chinese virus.
[01:50:46.655 --> 01:50:49.217]  And it was 10 times worse than I thought it would be.
[01:50:50.037 --> 01:50:56.119]  And yes, I did ultimately make a comeback thanks to ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
[01:50:56.479 --> 01:51:07.642]  But in the meantime, I started doing my own research and your iodine product, X2 and X3, absolutely crucial in terms of rebuilding your immunity.
[01:51:07.962 --> 01:51:13.003]  Now, just in case anybody's wondering, no, I'm not paid a penny to say this.
[01:51:13.323 --> 01:51:14.304]  Not a penny.
[01:51:15.044 --> 01:51:19.265]  I talk about these products on the InfoWars store because they work.
[01:51:20.054 --> 01:51:29.252]  You see, you could go to Amazon, you go to the vitamin shop, you go to a lot of places and you can buy similar products or similar sounding products.
[01:51:29.784 --> 01:51:31.145]  Here's what I know firsthand.
[01:51:31.505 --> 01:51:41.989]  And that is Alex Jones and the folks he works with use only the best ingredients in the purest form and at dosages that will actually help you.
[01:51:42.169 --> 01:51:43.030]  It's all natural.
[01:51:43.470 --> 01:51:44.630]  Everything's all natural.
[01:51:44.970 --> 01:51:50.813]  But I really believe the iodine played a crucial role in getting me back on my feet.
[01:51:51.693 --> 01:52:03.063]  Well, I'm just glad that, because I knew you already had it and had ordered it and gotten some before, but I'm glad that you went and did research and looked at it because there's so much that iodine does to the immune system, both internally but also topically.
[01:52:03.464 --> 01:52:11.451]  And like Dr. McCullough was on about all the big studies about a tiny bit of it in water and then inhaled into the nasal cavity is just amazing.
[01:52:11.471 --> 01:52:16.055]  So I hope folks find out about it and support the broadcast with X3 at Infowarstore.com.
[01:52:16.636 --> 01:52:16.936]  Roger?
[01:52:17.376 --> 01:52:20.757]  In the five, six months we have left here, thank you so much for spending Sunday evening with us.
[01:52:21.197 --> 01:52:23.058]  Jan 6, you heard my question before the break.
[01:52:23.358 --> 01:52:30.119]  The Democrats are just all in betting everything on this, but the polls, the research, the numbers show their constituents are sick of it.
[01:52:30.359 --> 01:52:31.780]  Republicans don't want to hear about it.
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:33.160]  This is just crazy.
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:35.941]  No, there's no there there.
[01:52:36.061 --> 01:52:46.531]   First of all, we learned last week definitively that the massive doors to the Capitol that can only be opened from the inside, We're in fact open from the inside.
[01:52:46.871 --> 01:52:51.772]  And now there's a new smear against that great American patriot, General Michael Flynn.
[01:52:52.412 --> 01:52:57.614]  It is alleged that there was a draft of a memo that talked about seizing the machines.
[01:52:58.234 --> 01:53:00.315]  A draft, a draft that was never acted on.
[01:53:00.675 --> 01:53:07.977]  In fact, as I understand it, General Flynn's reaction to the memo was, somebody needs to run this by the lawyers and see if it's even legal.
[01:53:08.757 --> 01:53:14.042]  I mean, if I thought about murdering someone, but then I don't murder them, can I be prosecuted for murder?
[01:53:14.362 --> 01:53:15.063]  Of course not.
[01:53:15.543 --> 01:53:18.265]  Now you're being prosecuted for thought crimes.
[01:53:18.345 --> 01:53:19.086]  Let's be clear.
[01:53:19.446 --> 01:53:22.229]  General Flynn did not recommend martial law.
[01:53:22.529 --> 01:53:26.573]  General Flynn did not recommend the Insurrection Act.
[01:53:26.833 --> 01:53:30.196]  General Flynn did not recommend the seizing of the machines.
[01:53:30.696 --> 01:53:33.559]  General Flynn had the same position I did, that you did.
[01:53:33.579 --> 01:53:34.500]  A 10-day delay.
[01:53:36.381 --> 01:53:43.344]  So that the individual states could examine the anomalies and the irregularities in the election.
[01:53:43.764 --> 01:53:49.407]  This hatchet job in the New York Times by this fellow Draper is an outrage.
[01:53:50.094 --> 01:53:50.714]  I'm sorry.
[01:53:50.814 --> 01:53:53.375]  I've seen the attacks on him online and I'm not buying it.
[01:53:53.775 --> 01:53:57.697]  General Michael Flynn is one of the finest Christian gentlemen I've ever met.
[01:53:58.137 --> 01:54:01.218]  He is an actual war hero if you look at his record.
[01:54:01.598 --> 01:54:06.080]  And I believe his greatest days of public service lie ahead.
[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:09.021]  I'm sick and tired of people dumping on this guy.
[01:54:09.421 --> 01:54:10.981]  He is a true patriot.
[01:54:11.601 --> 01:54:13.722]  And these smears are very clear.
[01:54:14.042 --> 01:54:15.663]  Why did they smear General Flynn?
[01:54:15.723 --> 01:54:16.583]  I'll tell you why.
[01:54:17.363 --> 01:54:18.844]  Because they fear him.
[01:54:19.713 --> 01:54:25.198]  Because as the former Director of Intelligence, he knows where the bodies are buried.
[01:54:25.559 --> 01:54:27.220]  He knows what the Chinese are up to.
[01:54:27.521 --> 01:54:29.362]  He knows what the North Koreans are up to.
[01:54:29.683 --> 01:54:31.865]  He knows what's really going on in Ukraine.
[01:54:32.325 --> 01:54:44.257]  He's been among the most articulate voices of saying, stop this rush to war and let's work this out by not agreeing to put Western missiles on the border of Russia.
[01:54:44.757 --> 01:54:48.199]  The identical position of President John Kennedy in 1962.
[01:54:48.579 --> 01:54:55.824]  So I'm praying every day that we do not go to war because I'm a libertarian Republican.
[01:54:55.864 --> 01:54:59.446]  I'm a Rand Paul Republican when you get right down to it.
[01:54:59.886 --> 01:55:04.549]  But you can see the drumbeat of the Democrat media cabal.
[01:55:04.989 --> 01:55:07.371]  Don't look over here at what the Chinese are doing.
[01:55:07.671 --> 01:55:08.572]  Look over here.
[01:55:09.332 --> 01:55:12.574]  Putin wants to take over the country and insert a puppet government.
[01:55:13.134 --> 01:55:14.215]  That's not what he's saying.
[01:55:14.235 --> 01:55:16.056]  I don't think that is his aim.
[01:55:16.076 --> 01:55:24.960]  And if you want to go call me a Russian spy or a Russian loyalist or a Russian traitor, that's nonsense too.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:26.200]  I'm in America.
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:27.321]  I love America.
[01:55:27.621 --> 01:55:29.582]  This is not good for America.
[01:55:29.962 --> 01:55:42.327]   Well, I've really had a chance to be there at January 6th and to see it from all the different angles, and I know what happened now, and I'm going to make a short documentary sometime next week or the week after that's just like 10 minutes long that Here's definitive what happened.
[01:55:42.327 --> 01:55:44.927]  It was surrounded by commandos.
[01:55:44.927 --> 01:55:46.606]  They ordered the police to stand down.
[01:55:46.606 --> 01:55:50.087]   They had some anti-provocateurs, some other leftists there directing people in.
[01:55:50.087 --> 01:55:52.367]  The riot cops attacked some people.
[01:55:52.367 --> 01:55:56.847]   Provocateurs and some folks got caught up emotionally and involved and also helped the
[01:55:56.847 --> 01:55:57.846]  anti-folk.
[01:55:57.846 --> 01:56:01.166]  And they went in and all this went on.
[01:56:01.166 --> 01:56:06.846]   But we have to remember Pelosi was saying Trump will be removed by maybe even the insurrection
[01:56:07.149 --> 01:56:08.350]  She said, we'll have martial law.
[01:56:08.630 --> 01:56:10.390]  Even if he wins the election, we're not going to accept it.
[01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:11.751]  We're going to hold our own inauguration.
[01:56:12.331 --> 01:56:15.792]  They said that we'd have a civil war in the New York Times.
[01:56:16.292 --> 01:56:21.113]  So they raised the temperature, burned down billions of dollars of buildings, attacked police.
[01:56:22.773 --> 01:56:27.715]  The vice president, who later became vice president, was bailing murderers and criminals out of jail.
[01:56:30.074 --> 01:56:35.860]  Out of a million people, a couple hundred fight the police, a few thousand get waved into the building, and they arrest those that peacefully went in.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.061]  This is outrageous.
[01:56:37.342 --> 01:56:38.363]  This is a fraud.
[01:56:38.803 --> 01:56:45.050]  And bare minimum, the federal government stood down and refused Trump's request for National Guard a month before.
[01:56:45.310 --> 01:56:49.194]  And so it's on them because they created the conditions to allow this to happen.
[01:56:49.214 --> 01:56:49.695]  Roger Stone.
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:51.581]  Absolutely true.
[01:56:51.641 --> 01:56:56.424]  And Alex, those who have been arrested, and some of them are guilty of more serious crimes than others.
[01:56:56.484 --> 01:56:59.626]  Many are merely guilty of trespassing.
[01:57:00.127 --> 01:57:01.808]  They are allowed due process.
[01:57:02.512 --> 01:57:04.854]  They shouldn't be given food laced with feces.
[01:57:05.374 --> 01:57:12.540]  They shouldn't be allowed to have no access to a law library or a computer if they choose to represent themselves pro se.
[01:57:13.001 --> 01:57:15.322]  We are violating the Geneva Conventions.
[01:57:15.843 --> 01:57:19.426]  We treat terrorists better than we treat these American citizens.
[01:57:19.766 --> 01:57:22.348]  We all need to be praying for those who are incarcerated.
[01:57:22.908 --> 01:57:25.210]  I'm for justice for those who did violent things.
[01:57:25.531 --> 01:57:26.732]  They should be prosecuted.
[01:57:27.112 --> 01:57:29.414]  But so many of these people did nothing violent.
[01:57:29.714 --> 01:57:30.655]  They are misguided.
[01:57:31.195 --> 01:57:33.076]  The idea of three years.
[01:57:33.637 --> 01:57:35.298]  Three years in jail for trespassing.
[01:57:35.938 --> 01:57:38.740]  They keep talking about the deadly attack on the Capitol.
[01:57:38.780 --> 01:57:39.020]  That's right.
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:42.162]  The only two people killed were unarmed women killed by the Capitol.
[01:57:42.222 --> 01:57:43.903]  All right, Roger Stone, thank you so much.
[01:57:43.943 --> 01:57:44.363]  God bless.
[01:57:44.383 --> 01:57:45.143]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:57:45.163 --> 01:57:46.724]  I'm about to host two more hours.
[01:57:46.764 --> 01:57:50.006]  If your stations don't carry it, find it at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[01:57:51.087 --> 01:57:56.110]  I really regret it when I forget to take high-quality iodine supplements.
[01:57:57.139 --> 01:57:58.280]  It is the good halogen.
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:06.685]  The UN admits 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities on the face of the earth today.
[01:58:07.845 --> 01:58:13.108]  That's over 20% because they have had iodine deficiencies.
[01:58:14.029 --> 01:58:16.050]  Now we've got two different great iodine products.
[01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.851]  We've got X2.
[01:58:16.931 --> 01:58:17.471]  It's amazing.
[01:58:18.243 --> 01:58:20.606]  Pure Deep Earth Crystal Atomic Iodine.
[01:58:21.086 --> 01:58:22.328]  And it's been sold out for a while.
[01:58:22.748 --> 01:58:33.079]  We finally got X3 back in, that is the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, and then two other types, because some studies show it helps with the absorption of the pure iodine.
[01:58:33.339 --> 01:58:34.301]  So it's apples and oranges.
[01:58:34.941 --> 01:58:36.042]  Both formulas are excellent.
[01:58:36.062 --> 01:58:39.566]  People constantly ask me, including on the street, what's better, X2 or X3?
[01:58:41.201 --> 01:58:41.862]  Apples and oranges.
[01:58:41.942 --> 01:58:46.647]  It's like, do you like iceberg lettuce or do you like spinach?
[01:58:46.667 --> 01:58:48.869]  I mean, it's two different things.
[01:58:48.949 --> 01:58:51.912]  It's like a tomato versus a potato.
[01:58:52.953 --> 01:58:55.516]  Bottom line, your body needs iodine.
[01:58:56.336 --> 01:58:59.840]  And the globalists are bombarding all of us with bad
