[00:00:00.409 --> 00:00:06.235]  It's all about they can do whatever they want and we got to just stand down and put up with this crap.
[00:00:08.377 --> 00:00:10.159]  But man, let that sink in.
[00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:11.620]  Put this full show headline up.
[00:00:12.741 --> 00:00:24.012]  World Economic Forum publicly declares an information warfare operation with information warriors to counter InfoWars and other disinformation outlets.
[00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:34.904]  How honored are you, as the Army of Infowars, to know that you're in direct conflict and information warfare with Klaus Schwab, the new world order?
[00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:37.568]  Now do you understand why I say share the articles and videos?
[00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:46.034]   Now do you understand why I say Magnify what we're doing because I don't want to be the best in the fight because I'm not that good.
[00:00:46.374 --> 00:00:47.295]  I want to stop these people.
[00:00:47.355 --> 00:00:53.021]  I want to see other leaders like Tucker Carlson, Bolsonaro, Joe Rogan, countless others stand up and they're starting to.
[00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:53.882]  But you know what?
[00:00:53.922 --> 00:01:00.670]  The enemy recognizes us and me as the number one enemy of their new world order.
[00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:10.358]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:10.197 --> 00:01:12.197]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:32.197]  [Music]
[00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:34.266]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:44.766]   Mass starvation and collapse of third world flooding the first world.
[00:01:44.786 --> 00:01:45.446]  Run by the UN.
[00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:46.707]  The replacement migration.
[00:01:46.947 --> 00:01:52.750]  Driven by bus and fueled by politics, another wave of migrants arrived in New York City today.
[00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.732]  Polio virus has been detected in wastewater samples in New York City.
[00:01:57.072 --> 00:02:01.194]  The New York State Department of Health says that the virus is likely circulating locally.
[00:02:01.374 --> 00:02:04.156]  Tens of millions dying from the poison shots already.
[00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:05.617]  Imagine how bad it's going to get.
[00:02:06.717 --> 00:02:11.621]  My father, my cousin, my brother, my husband, and my wife took this shot, and they're gone.
[00:02:12.082 --> 00:02:14.524]  See, you're gonna sit here, and you're gonna keep playing with the people.
[00:02:14.544 --> 00:02:23.751]  You're gonna keep getting on this tell-all vision, making it seem as though these tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of families are just crazy, until it blows up.
[00:02:23.991 --> 00:02:31.373]  Then the collapsing borders, the wars, the fentanyl being shipped in, the pedophilia being promoted via drag queen pedophile time.
[00:02:31.653 --> 00:02:36.915]  And when you look at what they're doing, it's total war against our civilization.
[00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:40.075]  Senate passes sweeping tax climate change package.
[00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:49.878]  It hires 80 plus thousand IRS agents in the legislation to target blue collar and middle class people to shut down small businesses.
[00:02:50.398 --> 00:02:52.699]  What do you think the lockdowns were?
[00:02:53.379 --> 00:03:02.663]  For six months in 2020, and longer in places like California and New York over a year, saying small businesses are not essential, but big corporations are essential.
[00:03:02.924 --> 00:03:05.125]  That's designed to destroy small business.
[00:03:05.445 --> 00:03:07.286]  That's designed to consolidate power.
[00:03:07.526 --> 00:03:09.947]  That's designed to siege an economic war.
[00:03:10.347 --> 00:03:16.051]  Ammunition, handcuffs, and first aid is generally what everybody wears.
[00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.113]  And then it just depends on the individual and what else they want to carry.
[00:03:19.193 --> 00:03:20.034]  And no tasers?
[00:03:20.114 --> 00:03:20.734]  No tasers.
[00:03:20.894 --> 00:03:22.395]  So the hierarchy of issues.
[00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:27.539]  Mass starvation, new lockdowns, forced injections, mass death.
[00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:35.359]  67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 91, 92, 93, 94...
[00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:37.359]  94 dead bodies.
[00:03:37.705 --> 00:03:39.405]  We never have this many.
[00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:41.906]  I've come here for the last eight, nine years.
[00:03:42.306 --> 00:03:58.572]  The eve of World War III, the proxy war in Ukraine, the collapsing borders, tripling of the average of suicide, crime rates exploding, George Soros buying up, thousands of DAs and county attorneys having them stand down for real crime, while persecuting their political enemies.
[00:03:58.812 --> 00:03:59.632]  That's all huge.
[00:04:00.032 --> 00:04:04.454]  And down there at the bottom is the persecution of Alex Jones at his show trials.
[00:04:05.375 --> 00:04:14.586]  But then why wasn't the number one story off and on, on Instagram, on Google, on Facebook, on Twitter, in the last two weeks, Alex Jones?
[00:04:15.147 --> 00:04:16.529]  Every day we've printed number one.
[00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:26.638]  Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of articles every corporate TV station every network lying about us Attacking saying we're the enemy.
[00:04:26.878 --> 00:04:31.522]  We're the problem shut us down Don't you see it when they talk about?
[00:04:32.382 --> 00:04:37.146]   Alex Jones, they're talking about you when I say this You need to really let that sink in.
[00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:40.049]  They see me as the populist resistance.
[00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:42.511]  They see me as everything they hate.
[00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:45.434]  Pro-human, pro-God, pro-family, pro-truth.
[00:04:45.914 --> 00:04:49.157]  Asking questions not daunted by them, not intimidated.
[00:04:49.457 --> 00:04:50.878]  They see that dauntless spirit.
[00:04:51.559 --> 00:05:02.325]  That indomitable spirit as their enemy because they hate you whether you're white or brown or black or gay or straight or old or young or where you're from.
[00:05:02.986 --> 00:05:06.147]  They want to break your will and they want to dominate and control you.
[00:05:06.848 --> 00:05:10.710]  And so the attack on InfoWars is not the bottom of the hierarchy.
[00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.951]  It's the top.
[00:05:13.071 --> 00:05:15.693]  Individually, it's not important.
[00:05:17.239 --> 00:05:18.179]  In the scale of things.
[00:05:18.739 --> 00:05:33.963]  But when you realize what they fear, you being vocal, you having courage, that they're trying to chill you, and trying to intimidate you, and trying to scare others from telling the truth, then you understand that our speech and our resistance and our non-compliance is beyond paramount.
[00:05:34.463 --> 00:05:35.343]  It is essential.
[00:05:36.203 --> 00:05:37.003]  It is critical.
[00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:39.044]  It is key!
[00:05:40.164 --> 00:05:40.464]  Key!
[00:05:44.403 --> 00:05:47.384]  Ladies and gentlemen, it has been officially announced.
[00:05:48.964 --> 00:05:50.124]  I am so proud of this.
[00:05:51.084 --> 00:05:54.685]  The World Economic Forum has declared direct war on Infowars.
[00:05:56.605 --> 00:06:00.166]  And they are now building their own, quote, information warfare army to counter us.
[00:06:00.846 --> 00:06:02.006]  We'll cover it when we come back.
[00:06:02.526 --> 00:06:03.067]  Stay with us.
[00:06:04.407 --> 00:06:07.407]  It's the live August 19th, 2022 Friday edition of The Vaunted.
[00:06:11.994 --> 00:06:15.636]  They attacked the embattled Infowars transmission.
[00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:19.498]  There's too much confusion!
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.341]  I can't get no relief.
[00:06:26.341 --> 00:06:40.221]   If you thought the news was intense a year ago, and you think it's intense now,
[00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:50.221]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:42.851]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:52.437]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live, uncensored, unfiltered, teleprompter-free transmission of We The People.
[00:06:54.878 --> 00:06:55.779]  Let me just do this.
[00:06:55.859 --> 00:06:57.640]  Let me just give you the main stack headlines.
[00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.083]  We're going to plow through them all, take calls, and have a special guest in studio.
[00:07:04.144 --> 00:07:05.785]  They put out a press release yesterday.
[00:07:06.305 --> 00:07:08.647]  They put out a podcast with Klaus Schwab and others.
[00:07:09.878 --> 00:07:22.748]  And they have declared their number one enemy, InfoWars, and have said that they've hired 110,000 operatives that they called information warriors.
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.400]  Where have we heard that term before?
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.321]  The Info Warriors.
[00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:29.962]  To counter, we the people.
[00:07:32.422 --> 00:07:38.424]  I mean, man, I keep trying to explain to the listeners, they're really scared of us.
[00:07:38.864 --> 00:07:43.946]  Not just me, but the fact that we've got the Death Star plans.
[00:07:47.987 --> 00:07:53.929]  And if people pay attention, folks will know the future and how to counter what's about to go down.
[00:07:55.185 --> 00:07:56.066]  And then it's game over.
[00:07:56.526 --> 00:08:03.650]  And they are so panicked that we know their exact plans from deep research and total focus.
[00:08:04.571 --> 00:08:11.435]  And then if Congress and legislatures and other leaders like Bolsonaro run with the ball, it's game over.
[00:08:11.816 --> 00:08:14.778]  Klaus Schwab's going to prison like his grandfather.
[00:08:16.899 --> 00:08:17.619]  It's Nuremberg 2.0.
[00:08:21.249 --> 00:08:25.293]  But if we don't expose them, they're going to collapse civilization around us and pose us as savers.
[00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:31.060]  That is stack number one.
[00:08:34.103 --> 00:08:35.465]  Let me tell you about the other stacks.
[00:08:37.881 --> 00:08:54.660]  Research scientists have confirmed that it is not the COVID vaccine causing the blood clots in the blood, it is creating artificial nanotech graphene oxide bridges using your cell's own material to form the clots in the body.
[00:08:55.061 --> 00:08:55.521]  Ultra.
[00:08:56.142 --> 00:08:56.583]  Ultra.
[00:08:57.103 --> 00:08:57.584]  Massive.
[00:09:00.748 --> 00:09:08.853]  More footage coming out of the military trying to stop illegal aliens literally cutting down border fences and knocking over border fences.
[00:09:09.273 --> 00:09:12.415]  The Border Patrol now physically stopping the military.
[00:09:14.937 --> 00:09:16.458]  Dramatic footage, that's coming up.
[00:09:18.155 --> 00:09:22.318]  FBI agent pleads guilty to destroying evidence to frame pro-Trump political prisoner.
[00:09:22.898 --> 00:09:31.564]  National poll shows all-time low confidence of the FBI and the Democratic Party, and the average American now believes the FBI is a political gestapo.
[00:09:33.105 --> 00:09:35.105]  That's coming up.
[00:09:35.105 --> 00:09:43.105]  We have some celebratory things here to make fun of.
[00:09:43.902 --> 00:09:46.283]  But I don't know if I can laugh because I want to cry.
[00:09:47.183 --> 00:09:50.745]  Brian Stelter, who already had no viewers, so his show was already cancelled.
[00:09:50.985 --> 00:09:56.367]  If no one's watching, like 100,000 viewers, I mean, small local radio shows have that.
[00:09:58.628 --> 00:10:01.849]  We have millions and millions and millions of listeners an hour.
[00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.771]  So, if he already didn't have any viewers, it's...
[00:10:10.578 --> 00:10:13.040]  It's a fact that he had a zombie broadcast like CNN.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:13.960]  It's dead.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.581]  It's not alive.
[00:10:14.601 --> 00:10:15.181]  No one's watching.
[00:10:15.221 --> 00:10:15.721]  It's a joke.
[00:10:17.422 --> 00:10:20.204]  But he's been fired and boy did the internet explode with that.
[00:10:20.244 --> 00:10:26.248]  A lot of entertaining memes and reminded me of some of the incredible lies that Stelter told.
[00:10:26.288 --> 00:10:34.853]  But he's emblematic of these smug, unaware psychos that the system hires to try to lie to us.
[00:10:36.274 --> 00:10:42.532]   Now it's also come out why Pelosi went to Taiwan And threaten World War 3 was a pump and dump.
[00:10:42.592 --> 00:10:44.292]  It's all confirmed for her corrupt husband.
[00:10:44.552 --> 00:10:47.893]  They've made billions off insider trading knowledge.
[00:10:47.933 --> 00:10:49.433]  This time on microchips.
[00:10:50.634 --> 00:10:53.014]  With the largest, one of the largest chip manufacturers in the world.
[00:10:53.434 --> 00:10:54.194]  That's coming up.
[00:10:55.435 --> 00:10:57.595]  And this video came out a few days ago and went viral.
[00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:00.176]  He since responded and said he's proud of it.
[00:11:00.216 --> 00:11:00.836]  We're going to play it.
[00:11:03.637 --> 00:11:07.978]  And that's Sam Harris, the supposed big intellectual saying, of course we censor conservatives.
[00:11:08.018 --> 00:11:08.838]  It's a good thing to do.
[00:11:12.461 --> 00:11:13.422]  And bragging about it all.
[00:11:14.043 --> 00:11:17.366]  Then we've got Putin talking about a boss move.
[00:11:19.248 --> 00:11:23.993]  Will attend the G20 Summit in Indonesia despite US demands to exclude the Russian leader.
[00:11:25.915 --> 00:11:31.140]  Majority of college students in a new study have mental illness.
[00:11:32.602 --> 00:11:34.042]  Well, that's what the New World Order causes.
[00:11:34.883 --> 00:11:41.924]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, who'll be joining us next week, introduces a bill to make gender-affirming care for transgender youth a felony.
[00:11:42.344 --> 00:11:43.705]  You mean the sterilization of children?
[00:11:44.905 --> 00:11:52.587]  A child can't buy alcohol or cigarettes or join the military, but the state can confuse them into saying they're a different gender, and they can take away parental rights?
[00:11:53.967 --> 00:11:54.687]  That's coming up!
[00:11:56.268 --> 00:11:57.328]  Censorship update!
[00:11:57.368 --> 00:12:00.909]  Facebook bans libs of TED Talk, YouTube suspends Steven Crowder.
[00:12:03.103 --> 00:12:21.652]  Meanwhile, big developments in Ukraine as fighting intensifies around the largest nuclear reactor in Europe, and Zelensky has banned criminally, violated the Geneva Convention, any aid to refugees in Russian-held areas, saying anyone helping anyone with water or food will be put in prison.
[00:12:24.173 --> 00:12:28.875]  That's just some of the war crimes we're going to be breaking down here today.
[00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:43.294]   That is just part Of the menu, the cornucopia, the plethora, the huge spectrum of information we've got to cover.
[00:12:43.394 --> 00:12:47.697]  By the way, 99.9% of the monkeypox cases with no deaths in the U.S.
[00:12:48.137 --> 00:12:51.319]  are gay men having hundreds of sexual partners a month.
[00:12:53.601 --> 00:12:58.204]  And the media is defending it, saying, we want you to go under lockdown, we want you to wear masks.
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.862]  But we want to continue, actually I have articles, the gay orgies.
[00:13:05.002 --> 00:13:14.266]  So you gotta wear a mask, you gotta go under lockdown they're saying coming soon, but these men can get together and give each other a bunch of diseases.
[00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.166]  Disgusting.
[00:13:17.467 --> 00:13:19.968]  Absolutely disgusting to spread disease like that.
[00:13:20.288 --> 00:13:22.489]  I don't care if you're heterosexual or homosexual.
[00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:28.431]  Men and women, men and women were having hundreds of sexual partners a month and spreading disease.
[00:13:28.471 --> 00:13:29.572]  That's disgusting.
[00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:31.480]  That's dangerous.
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.201]  It's like saying you're going to go lick toilet bowls at the airport.
[00:13:37.362 --> 00:13:38.162]  That's what this is.
[00:13:39.603 --> 00:13:44.504]  Oh, but it's okay that Tim Cook runs death camps in China because he's gay.
[00:13:45.304 --> 00:13:46.465]  And he wears a little turtleneck.
[00:13:46.505 --> 00:13:47.665]  It's like, oh, he's non-threatening.
[00:13:47.685 --> 00:13:48.065]  He's gay.
[00:13:48.085 --> 00:13:48.505]  It's all right.
[00:13:48.725 --> 00:13:50.366]  He runs death camps with suicide nets around him.
[00:13:50.606 --> 00:13:51.206]  The same thing here.
[00:13:51.246 --> 00:13:52.246]  Well, it's all right.
[00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:55.547]  You know, we got a lockdown society because of what you're doing.
[00:13:55.988 --> 00:13:56.768]  Just keep doing it.
[00:13:56.788 --> 00:13:59.989]  We're going to make little kids, though, wear masks over their faces.
[00:14:00.922 --> 00:14:02.924]  It's like, well, so what if they rape dogs?
[00:14:03.945 --> 00:14:04.666]  Faciality.
[00:14:05.727 --> 00:14:07.829]  And give them monkey pox, and they gotta be euthanized.
[00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.111]  It's liberal!
[00:14:10.312 --> 00:14:16.138]  It's all about, they can do whatever they want, and we gotta just stand down and put up with this crap.
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.002]  But man, let that sink in.
[00:14:20.022 --> 00:14:21.484]  I'm gonna put this full show headline up.
[00:14:22.619 --> 00:14:33.887]  World Economic Forum publicly declares an information warfare operation with information warriors to counter InfoWars and other disinformation outlets.
[00:14:35.828 --> 00:14:44.774]  How honored are you, as the army of InfoWars, to know that you're in direct conflict and information warfare with Klaus Schwab, the new world order?
[00:14:45.154 --> 00:14:47.436]  Now do you understand why I say share the articles and videos?
[00:14:47.816 --> 00:14:55.909]   Now do you understand why I say Magnify what we're doing because I don't want to be the best in the fight because I'm not that good.
[00:14:56.249 --> 00:14:57.169]  I want to stop these people.
[00:14:57.229 --> 00:15:02.891]  I want to see other leaders like Tucker Carlson, Bolsonaro, Joe Rogan, countless others stand up and they're starting to.
[00:15:03.191 --> 00:15:03.751]  But you know what?
[00:15:03.811 --> 00:15:10.552]  The enemy recognizes us and me as the number one enemy of their new world order.
[00:15:11.153 --> 00:15:12.433]  I told you 20 years ago.
[00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:28.998]  I was eating a chicken fried steak and drinking an iced tea 20-something years ago at Waterloo Ice House after I'd done a two-hour TV show that I literally, talking about a vision, it was like a download, and God showed me the future, what was going to happen, and also how dangerous it would be, and said, are you ready to shine on for this?
[00:15:29.318 --> 00:15:33.951]   And I remember sitting there, Alone in that restaurant and going, yes, I accept this.
[00:15:33.971 --> 00:15:34.731]  It was like I was floating.
[00:15:34.751 --> 00:15:36.651]  I go, yes, I accept the mission.
[00:15:36.832 --> 00:15:38.632]  And it went, here's the rest of the download.
[00:15:38.852 --> 00:15:41.433]  And I got slammed with the imprint of data.
[00:15:41.593 --> 00:15:44.354]  And it was like, all right, soldier, you joined, get ready.
[00:15:45.014 --> 00:15:47.675]  I literally was commissioned by God for this war.
[00:15:49.475 --> 00:15:50.836]  I was born for this fight.
[00:15:52.936 --> 00:15:53.716]  And so were you.
[00:15:56.777 --> 00:15:59.018]  And now, we're about to be tested.
[00:16:01.636 --> 00:16:08.180]  We can see you, enemy, and we will destroy you.
[00:16:10.581 --> 00:16:12.862]  We will defend the children, as they say.
[00:16:16.984 --> 00:16:19.806]  Here we are, inside the New World Order.
[00:16:20.686 --> 00:16:39.807]   Well, the World Economic Forum, which is the mouth of the New World Order, the mouth of the UN, the mouth of megacorporations, the mouth of the slave masters, The spokesperson for evil has come out and said that their attempted world continual never-ending lockdown and forced injection failed.
[00:16:39.827 --> 00:16:41.128]  It was still devastating.
[00:16:42.429 --> 00:16:45.811]  And now there's a total rejection happening of them across the board.
[00:16:47.071 --> 00:16:51.534]  And billions of rotting poison mRNA gene therapies that no one will take.
[00:16:53.154 --> 00:16:53.855]  And their answer?
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:20.050]  Is a declaration of war, next level censorship, with 110,000 volunteers, inside media and big tech, an army of Brian Stelter Humpty Dumpty Pennywise's, to surveil and censor with AI tools the people of Earth.
[00:17:22.117 --> 00:17:29.863]  WEF announces recruitment of 110,000 information warriors, close quote, to counter info wars.
[00:17:30.604 --> 00:17:40.051]  We specifically in their documents are named and the American people and others resisting their design planetary collapse.
[00:17:40.731 --> 00:17:45.095]  Let's play a short clip of the podcast that the WEF spokesperson just put out.
[00:17:46.199 --> 00:18:16.613]   So part of this verified and pause campaign entails also recruiting people around the world and so far we've recruited a hundred and ten thousand information volunteers and We equip these information volunteers with the kind of knowledge about how misinformation spreads and ask them to serve as kind of digital first responders in those spaces where misinformation travels and that is in groups peer-to-peer.
[00:18:16.633 --> 00:18:22.498]  As she goes on to specifically call them information warriors.
[00:18:24.190 --> 00:18:28.133]  WEF announces recruitment of information warriors to control the narrative on social media.
[00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:40.421]  The World Economic Forum has announced it has recruited hundreds of thousands of information warriors to control the internet, police social media, and forums for misinformation, the conspiracy content, which will then be systematically shut down.
[00:18:40.801 --> 00:18:43.683]  But who put out the conspiracy content?
[00:18:43.703 --> 00:18:46.365]  Can we pull up the Fauci clip from 25 years ago?
[00:18:48.066 --> 00:18:55.488]  Where he says natural immunity is 100% when you've had a virus, which is a fact, but if you tried to say it, you were censored.
[00:18:56.308 --> 00:18:56.988]  You still are.
[00:18:58.009 --> 00:19:09.852]  And now the CDC director, Walensky, announces major agency changes after COVID missteps, and they go on to admit they lied to us about everything.
[00:19:10.292 --> 00:19:14.593]  Citing botched pandemic response, calls for CDC reorganization.
[00:19:15.703 --> 00:19:17.624]  Admit CDC made dramatic mistakes.
[00:19:18.485 --> 00:19:20.186]  Yeah, you lied to us on purpose.
[00:19:20.546 --> 00:19:24.749]  That's even in the SPARS 2025-2028 document.
[00:19:28.342 --> 00:19:31.923]  Which is really 2020-2023 document of their lifetime attack.
[00:19:32.443 --> 00:19:33.603]  The tweets are almost identical.
[00:19:33.623 --> 00:19:38.544]  You just move the letters around as a little joke and it completes the tweets are actually put out.
[00:19:38.944 --> 00:19:42.905]  They wrote that years before they launched it because they're following handbooks, blueprints.
[00:19:43.205 --> 00:19:53.227]  That's how they get such unification and mechanized, systematic execution of their multifaceted, multivariate operation.
[00:19:54.755 --> 00:20:00.107]  But here is Fauci saying natural immunity is the king daddy.
[00:20:00.629 --> 00:20:04.437]  And remember, you're not allowed to say that today on any corporate platform.
[00:20:04.477 --> 00:20:04.778]  Here it is.
[00:20:05.536 --> 00:20:07.077]  But she's had the flu for 14 days.
[00:20:07.117 --> 00:20:08.078]  Should she get a flu shot?
[00:20:08.278 --> 00:20:08.678]  Well, no.
[00:20:08.698 --> 00:20:15.181]  If she got the flu for 14 days, she's as protected as anybody can be, because the best vaccination is to get infected yourself.
[00:20:15.902 --> 00:20:17.303]  And she should not get it?
[00:20:17.483 --> 00:20:23.226]  If she really has the flu, if she really has the flu, she definitely doesn't need a flu vaccine.
[00:20:24.166 --> 00:20:25.447]  If she really has the flu.
[00:20:25.587 --> 00:20:26.768]  She should not get it again?
[00:20:26.828 --> 00:20:32.031]  No, she doesn't need it, because it's the most potent vaccination is getting infected yourself.
[00:20:34.741 --> 00:20:41.043]  Fauci's on video, so is the Surgeon General in his Star Trek outfit, saying natural immunity doesn't exist.
[00:20:42.124 --> 00:20:45.865]  Just like two men can have a baby or two women can have a baby in prison.
[00:20:46.706 --> 00:20:48.246]  None of it's true, but it doesn't matter.
[00:20:48.646 --> 00:20:51.687]  It's a war on logic.
[00:20:54.348 --> 00:21:10.606]   We got more of this critical information on Nancy Pelosi's insider trading, on Brian Stelter's collapse, on Sam Harris and his Arrogant, hubris-filled confession.
[00:21:11.548 --> 00:21:13.491]  That's all coming up next segment, but first...
[00:21:14.767 --> 00:21:21.792]  If the World Economic Forum, the head of the New World Order, says they want to counter InfoWars with their own information warriors, what does that mean?
[00:21:21.872 --> 00:21:27.055]  It means you're insane if you don't share all our articles and videos in any way you can.
[00:21:27.315 --> 00:21:32.719]  It means you're crazy if you don't recognize their number one enemy is your number one defender.
[00:21:33.059 --> 00:21:35.641]  I am 100% committed to you.
[00:21:35.661 --> 00:21:37.522]  100% unto death.
[00:21:38.923 --> 00:21:42.866]  Because I hate these devil worshippers and I know we can beat them and I want to get them.
[00:21:44.352 --> 00:21:46.215]  It's like a sheepdog's bred to kill wolves.
[00:21:47.777 --> 00:21:48.858]  I'm bred to kill lice.
[00:21:49.599 --> 00:21:50.781]  And that's why they hate us so much.
[00:21:51.062 --> 00:21:53.645]  I want to thank you for keeping us in attack formation.
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:22:02.248]  But you are literally, with your gravity of will and your prayer and your financial support and your word of mouth, holding us in possession against the enemy in a battle of wills!
[00:22:03.009 --> 00:22:08.654]  So go now, like you've never gone before, to InfoWarStore.com and energize us.
[00:22:08.975 --> 00:22:12.338]  The enemy has openly declared that we are your champion.
[00:22:12.558 --> 00:22:14.880]  They have openly declared that we must be destroyed.
[00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.183]  What more do you need?
[00:22:19.369 --> 00:22:22.531]  If somebody tried to stab your child, would you raise an arm to stop them?
[00:22:23.071 --> 00:22:23.351]  Yes!
[00:22:23.451 --> 00:22:24.652]  Well, we are that arm.
[00:22:25.112 --> 00:22:25.773]  And I will say it.
[00:22:25.853 --> 00:22:27.914]  I wish there were other people more successful.
[00:22:28.194 --> 00:22:29.515]  I wish I was not the tip of the spear.
[00:22:29.555 --> 00:22:30.235]  I'll be honest with you.
[00:22:30.435 --> 00:22:31.156]  This is not fun.
[00:22:31.376 --> 00:22:31.816]  But you know what?
[00:22:31.856 --> 00:22:35.058]  My spirit is strong and it's more powerful than ever!
[00:22:36.684 --> 00:22:38.325]  Because of God and because of your prayer.
[00:22:38.946 --> 00:22:41.849]  So I ask you now, go to InfoWarsTore.com or DNA Force Plus.

[00:23:01.526 --> 00:23:01.867]  Go now!
[00:23:03.416 --> 00:23:04.337]  Or Keith Raniere?
[00:23:04.518 --> 00:23:08.443]  Both were hit with Ricoh charges, but Epstein, Maxwell, no Ricoh there?
[00:23:09.244 --> 00:23:09.845]  I wonder why?
[00:23:11.621 --> 00:23:12.621]  Yeah, it's kind of weird.
[00:23:12.681 --> 00:23:19.744]  I mean, they grabbed some Alex Jones' texts the other day, and the line is that Alex Jones is the real criminal, not Jeffrey Epstein, right?
[00:23:19.964 --> 00:23:23.006]  But the second they got his texts, you know, you know everything.
[00:23:23.166 --> 00:23:26.507]  The embarrassing thing he's ever said, of course, is going to be in the New York Times.
[00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:33.030]  But they are affirmatively protecting Jeffrey Epstein, who's not even alive anymore.
[00:23:33.109 --> 00:23:54.709]  It's just one of the weirdest things I've ever seen.
[00:23:55.203 --> 00:24:01.088]  Well, it's about six months of text, late 2019, early 2020, because we turned that all over to him.
[00:24:01.108 --> 00:24:01.788]  That's the lie.
[00:24:01.808 --> 00:24:03.329]  They're defaulting and saying we didn't give them anything.
[00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:08.594]  That was just one raw chunk that had been searched by the lawyers in Connecticut that was sent to Texas and sent over to him.
[00:24:10.143 --> 00:24:15.526]  And I went and reviewed the text, it's Tucker sending me news articles, and me sending him articles.
[00:24:17.206 --> 00:24:19.648]  And making fun of Brian Stelter, that's actually in there.
[00:24:20.528 --> 00:24:22.749]  But, I mean, that's a few of the guilty pleasures.
[00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:26.711]  We have dinner, we talk about Brian Stelter, too.
[00:24:27.451 --> 00:24:30.533]  So, that's not the issue.
[00:24:31.253 --> 00:24:36.256]  They were all over Twitter celebrating, going, oh, Tucker's scared, that's why he said this.
[00:24:36.316 --> 00:24:36.776]  No, he's not.
[00:24:40.925 --> 00:24:50.452]  Instead of the elephant in the room of they've suppressed the names of the pedophiles raping children and the whole Jeffrey Epstein operation.
[00:24:50.532 --> 00:24:51.452]  That's his point!
[00:24:53.294 --> 00:24:56.896]  Is they protect these people while the general public has no privacy.
[00:24:57.176 --> 00:24:58.357]  That's what Tucker was saying.
[00:24:58.677 --> 00:25:01.579]  Not he's scared of what's in our text.
[00:25:04.001 --> 00:25:05.762]  I went and read the text of those six months.
[00:25:08.284 --> 00:25:09.265]  There's about 50 of them.
[00:25:10.413 --> 00:25:12.274]  And 40 of them are news articles.
[00:25:13.055 --> 00:25:16.117]  That's what news people do, is have you seen this?
[00:25:16.598 --> 00:25:17.518]  Have you seen that?
[00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:20.401]  You know, that's what we do.
[00:25:20.461 --> 00:25:21.601]  We share news links.
[00:25:22.222 --> 00:25:25.684]  How evil can you get, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:25:28.487 --> 00:25:34.685]   So, This isn't a story about Alex Jones's text.
[00:25:35.506 --> 00:25:43.612]  It's a story about how the left makes jokes when Tucker Carlson's talking about pedophilia and the people that did it being protected.
[00:25:43.912 --> 00:25:47.095]  And they arrogantly think it's a joke and they think it's funny.
[00:25:47.535 --> 00:25:58.123]  And that's why before I had all this Lockdown 2 news and Brian Stelter news and so much more and Nancy Pelosi insider trading news, I want to hit this news.
[00:26:00.585 --> 00:26:21.482]   Because if you want to talk about a Rosetta Stone, If you want to talk about a skeleton key, if you want to talk about something that really illustrates who we're up against and their hubris, their shmugness, their bravado, it's this clip.
[00:26:23.983 --> 00:26:28.265]  Sam Harris is a supposed deep dark web intellectual leftist.
[00:26:29.985 --> 00:26:31.546]  And he's doing an interview a few days ago.
[00:26:33.925 --> 00:26:37.406]  And he goes, well of course we censor conservatives and there's a conspiracy to do it.
[00:26:38.386 --> 00:26:39.606]  Trump's too dangerous.
[00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:42.487]  I mean, look what he did with Trump University.
[00:26:43.227 --> 00:26:47.728]  Giving people confidence in real estate and business and letting them network with each other?
[00:26:48.729 --> 00:26:50.789]  And charging them a few thousand dollars?
[00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:53.230]  That's way more valuable than college.
[00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.251]  Going and networking and learning about real estate.
[00:26:57.231 --> 00:27:04.864]   Ten years ago, at the start of the big boom, I mean, how many of those people Became very successful.
[00:27:05.024 --> 00:27:05.724]  It's up to them.
[00:27:06.685 --> 00:27:28.579]  But imagine, war in Ukraine, open borders, child sex trafficking, devalued currencies, record crime, defunding police, fentanyl, censorship, pedophilia, Hunter Biden, crack pipes, saying he's under the control of Chinese intelligence on the audios that he saved on his damn laptop.
[00:27:30.441 --> 00:27:33.384]  That's not an issue, according to Sam Harris, no.
[00:27:34.265 --> 00:27:40.531]  He goes, just look at nothing Biden can do, including dead bodies in a basement of children.
[00:27:44.115 --> 00:27:53.605]  And being compromised by foreign powers can compare to Trump University, which I think was a great deal.
[00:27:56.024 --> 00:28:02.065]  Weekends with Trump and top experts and brainstorming and networking.
[00:28:02.125 --> 00:28:05.766]  I mean, I can tell you, people ask, why did you go to college, you pathetic creature?
[00:28:06.446 --> 00:28:21.209]  Well, I mean, I got out of high school and I went and got a job selling memberships at a spa, at a gym, and I was making $100,000 a year when I was 19.
[00:28:25.953 --> 00:28:27.133]  I was driving a sports car.
[00:28:27.193 --> 00:28:29.174]  I was in a nice two-bedroom apartment.
[00:28:29.454 --> 00:28:30.774]  I was having the time of my life.
[00:28:30.794 --> 00:28:34.736]  $100,000, 30 years ago, was like a million dollars today.
[00:28:34.576 --> 00:28:39.214]  30 years ago was like a million dollars a day.
[00:28:39.214 --> 00:28:47.895]   I was 19 years old making a hundred plus thousand dollars a year working four hours a day because
[00:28:47.895 --> 00:28:49.056]  I became a salesman.
[00:28:49.764 --> 00:28:50.885]  And I sold a good product.
[00:28:51.725 --> 00:28:52.466]  And I look good.
[00:28:52.726 --> 00:28:54.027]  And people bought the memberships.
[00:28:54.287 --> 00:28:55.068]  Especially the women.
[00:28:55.288 --> 00:28:58.691]  But the point is, is that... And a few times went on a date.
[00:28:58.891 --> 00:28:59.392]  More than a few.
[00:29:00.993 --> 00:29:02.174]  I love that salesman job.
[00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:06.577]  The point is, is that... I'm red-blooded, folks.
[00:29:06.617 --> 00:29:07.158]  I don't lie about it.
[00:29:09.059 --> 00:29:12.380]  The point is that that was a real value.
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:14.780]  That experience was real.
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:18.041]  I should have paid to be a salesman at that hot club.
[00:29:20.662 --> 00:29:22.202]  One of the hottest gyms in Austin at the time.
[00:29:22.582 --> 00:29:23.662]  They said, hey, you want to be a salesman?
[00:29:24.242 --> 00:29:24.702]  I said, sure.
[00:29:25.403 --> 00:29:26.183]  Boom, salesman.
[00:29:26.903 --> 00:29:28.963]  First weekend, sold like 10 memberships.
[00:29:30.404 --> 00:29:36.998]   The point is, They say I don't have a college degree because I'm a loser.
[00:29:37.018 --> 00:29:41.800]  No, I don't have a college degree because I went on the fast track to success, but that doesn't even matter.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.140]  That's not even what I'm getting at here.
[00:29:45.421 --> 00:29:59.628]  The point is all these educated idiots like Sam Harris that talk real slow and act real smug and sit there in their chair and say, yeah, you know, the number one evil of Trump is his Trump University.
[00:30:00.148 --> 00:30:00.348]  What?
[00:30:02.349 --> 00:30:05.130]  The best thing you can do is go take top rated self seminars.
[00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:08.230]  That's the number one damn business in the United States.
[00:30:09.031 --> 00:30:11.411]  But I'm not going to digress on a rant about that anymore.
[00:30:11.431 --> 00:30:15.852]  We're going to go to break and come back with Sam Harris.
[00:30:18.673 --> 00:30:19.273]  Sitting there.
[00:30:20.493 --> 00:30:27.735]  Smugly saying all the crimes of the Bidens and the deep state do not compare to Trump University.
[00:30:31.096 --> 00:30:31.296]  What?
[00:30:36.158 --> 00:30:37.039]  And look at that face.
[00:30:37.099 --> 00:30:38.981]  It's like Brian Stelter or Yuval Harari.
[00:30:39.201 --> 00:30:43.284]  They've all got that super arrogant face, like they've got all the answers.
[00:30:43.485 --> 00:30:44.786]  But that's all they've got, folks.
[00:30:44.725 --> 00:30:53.564]   all hat no cattle. He's got a look on his face like he's got a five-foot-long
[00:30:53.564 --> 00:30:57.644]  Johnson and I bet he doesn't even have a penis.
[00:30:56.266 --> 00:30:57.447]  I'm using that as an analogy.
[00:30:57.687 --> 00:30:58.587]  Sorry I'm being gross here.
[00:30:58.868 --> 00:31:02.309]  But I mean, the guy is all talk, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:02.989 --> 00:31:12.694]  And he's so arrogant, they've now entered the final phase of hubris, where Marie Antoinette, when they're starving to death, and they're about to storm the palace, and the Bastille says, let them eat cake.
[00:31:13.294 --> 00:31:14.555]  They say she may not have said that.
[00:31:14.695 --> 00:31:15.435]  I don't know if she said it.
[00:31:15.676 --> 00:31:18.357]  But he is definitely saying, let them eat cake.
[00:31:18.637 --> 00:31:19.778]  Yeah, we're censoring you.
[00:31:20.078 --> 00:31:21.499]  Yeah, we're in a conspiracy against you.
[00:31:21.719 --> 00:31:23.360]  But we're the anointed ones.
[00:31:23.641 --> 00:31:25.042]  We have the moral authority.
[00:31:25.282 --> 00:31:26.462]  We know what's best.
[00:31:27.143 --> 00:31:28.984]  So we're gonna shut you down.
[00:31:29.284 --> 00:31:30.865]  We're gonna shut you up.
[00:31:32.486 --> 00:31:35.928]  Because I'm arrogant Sam Harris with my Mickey Mouse ears.
[00:31:37.289 --> 00:31:39.671]  And I know how to look confident like Klaus Schwab.
[00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:44.509]  And we're all supposed to just bow down to Sam Harris.
[00:31:46.050 --> 00:31:48.032]  As if we all didn't know they weren't censoring us.
[00:31:48.312 --> 00:31:51.455]  As if we didn't know about the Veritas videos and all the documents that came out.
[00:31:51.655 --> 00:31:53.696]  And now they're just like, of course we're censoring you!
[00:31:53.957 --> 00:31:54.737]  We know best!
[00:31:55.017 --> 00:31:55.938]  We're in charge!
[00:32:00.321 --> 00:32:11.080]  Come on, come on up.
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.441]  Come on, come on, come on, come on baby.
[00:32:14.545 --> 00:32:16.426]  C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
[00:32:17.706 --> 00:32:18.287]  Woo!
[00:32:21.088 --> 00:32:24.630]  C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!
[00:32:26.191 --> 00:32:33.034]  Every breath you take, every word you say, every move you make, I'll be watching you.
[00:32:34.515 --> 00:32:36.256]  You think you got AI technology?
[00:32:36.736 --> 00:32:37.856]  I got the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:39.337 --> 00:32:40.758]  I was given the complete download.
[00:32:42.349 --> 00:32:44.430]  Like I was hit by a ton of bricks in 1999.
[00:32:44.831 --> 00:32:49.894]  And I was already awake before that.
[00:32:50.715 --> 00:32:53.476]  I've got advanced intelligence and so do you.
[00:32:53.797 --> 00:32:55.378]  Just reach out to God and pray and you'll get it.
[00:32:57.239 --> 00:33:07.746]  Then we've got arrogant little boys like Sam Harris, the intellectual leftist, because he talks real soft and acts real powerful when he speaks.
[00:33:11.274 --> 00:33:20.820]  Confessing to what they're doing and saying, I mean, look at the crime of Trump's real estate seminar.
[00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:22.561]  I mean, that's horrible.
[00:33:23.061 --> 00:33:27.164]  Ten years ago, telling people getting real estate were the only places you could actually make money.
[00:33:29.846 --> 00:33:31.227]  Yeah, I defend Trump when he needs to be defended.
[00:33:31.487 --> 00:33:32.027]  I love Trump.
[00:33:32.547 --> 00:33:34.829]  I want Trump to come out against the shot and that he was conned.
[00:33:35.329 --> 00:33:36.170]  That's why I'm pushing him.
[00:33:37.705 --> 00:33:39.927]  I'm not trying to be part of a cheerleader squad for Trump.
[00:33:40.247 --> 00:33:42.749]  But Trump did 95% good.
[00:33:43.529 --> 00:33:44.910]  That's why I support him.
[00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.651]  It's why I'm pissed at him.
[00:33:48.473 --> 00:33:50.914]  Because he'll be destroyed being coupled to these shots.
[00:33:50.974 --> 00:33:51.715]  It's all coming out.
[00:33:51.755 --> 00:33:52.155]  It's deadly.
[00:33:52.335 --> 00:33:52.936]  It's all coming out.
[00:33:52.956 --> 00:33:53.436]  It doesn't work.
[00:33:53.676 --> 00:33:57.219]  Why do you think Bolsonaro and DeSantis and Orban have come out against it?
[00:33:57.399 --> 00:33:58.259]  Because they know.
[00:33:58.279 --> 00:34:00.701]  And they're getting uncoupled from it.
[00:34:02.983 --> 00:34:05.885]  I do these things to Trump because I support Trump.
[00:34:06.892 --> 00:34:10.874]  And I'm sick of his daughter and Jared Kushner and all the things they're doing.
[00:34:11.895 --> 00:34:12.635]  But I'm digressing.
[00:34:12.955 --> 00:34:18.138]  Here's Sam Harris extremely arrogantly trying to sell people like a snake.
[00:34:19.178 --> 00:34:21.219]  Guys, it was in my stack yesterday and the day before.
[00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:21.700]  I never covered it.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:24.861]  The London Guardian article about free speech is so important.
[00:34:25.161 --> 00:34:26.762]  We've got to censor people to protect it.
[00:34:27.442 --> 00:34:30.624]  You could not have a more perfect Orwellian statement.
[00:34:30.644 --> 00:34:32.265]  As soon as you find it, put it on screen.
[00:34:33.581 --> 00:34:37.184]  Then, free speech is important, that's why we've got a censor to protect it.
[00:34:38.245 --> 00:34:39.066]  That's not free speech.
[00:34:40.427 --> 00:34:48.854]  This isn't the thing that strong people do, this is what con artists, when they're cornered do, they sit up there and calmly sell you on the idea, this is good.
[00:34:49.435 --> 00:34:51.537]  Do you want free speech to thrive?
[00:34:52.157 --> 00:34:58.322]  Then it has to be regulated, now more than ever, Simon Jenkins, the London Guardian.
[00:34:59.924 --> 00:35:00.724]  Here's Sam Harrison.
[00:35:01.698 --> 00:35:07.800]  I mean, Hunter Biden, at that point, Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses of children in his basement.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.981]  I would not have cared, right?
[00:35:10.001 --> 00:35:11.281]  So I guess there's nothing.
[00:35:11.801 --> 00:35:13.202]  First of all, it's Hunter Biden, right?
[00:35:13.262 --> 00:35:29.507]  It's not, it's like, it's not Joe Biden, but even if Joe Biden, like even whatever scope of Joe Biden's corruption is, like if we could just go down that rabbit hole endlessly and understand that he's getting kickbacks from Hunter Biden's deals in Ukraine or wherever else, right?
[00:35:30.147 --> 00:35:30.587]  Or China.
[00:35:31.934 --> 00:35:38.878]  It is infinitesimal compared to the corruption we know Trump is involved in.
[00:35:39.018 --> 00:35:40.059]  It's like, it's like... Hey boss!
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:58.129]  So you don't think I'm editing it back up to the beginning and I'm not gonna stop it anymore but... Being a Chinese communist agent who have nuclear missiles and are threatening to attack us and are shipping fentanyl in and annihilating our jobs and buying off our politicians like Nancy Pelosi and Dianne Feinstein...
[00:35:59.238 --> 00:36:01.279]  It's infinitesimal.
[00:36:01.319 --> 00:36:03.180]  What a big fancy word he used.
[00:36:03.961 --> 00:36:07.743]  It's infinitesimal compared to a real estate conference.
[00:36:10.344 --> 00:36:10.844]  What?
[00:36:10.844 --> 00:36:14.202]  What?
[00:36:14.202 --> 00:36:18.603]  What?
[00:36:18.603 --> 00:36:26.262]   All the way to beat inflation is storable food or real estate.
[00:36:26.451 --> 00:36:28.814]  And look at Sam Harris' face in that shot with Joe Rogan.
[00:36:29.334 --> 00:36:31.817]  I mean, that guy literally thinks he's God.
[00:36:32.998 --> 00:36:34.379]  That's a delusion in his head.
[00:36:36.261 --> 00:36:39.385]  But he's so smart, because he knows how to bug his eyes out.
[00:36:41.707 --> 00:36:42.488]  It's disgusting.
[00:36:43.888 --> 00:36:47.311]  Disgusting person and he's a laughingstock now and everybody hates him.
[00:36:47.751 --> 00:36:56.219]  Because he thought he could arrogantly come out and have the discussions he has in private with other scumbags about you and I. And how we deserve to be silenced by him.
[00:36:56.539 --> 00:37:00.702]  First they silence you, then they take everything you got, then they kill you!
[00:37:01.043 --> 00:37:04.606]  Well listen Sam Harris, you and the rest of the evil cockroaches!
[00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.091]  And fill your hand, because we're done with your ass.
[00:37:08.111 --> 00:37:09.672]  Go ahead and play this piece of crap.
[00:37:10.312 --> 00:37:16.095]  Hunter Biden, at that point, Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses of children in his basement.
[00:37:16.856 --> 00:37:18.256]  I would not have cared, right?
[00:37:18.356 --> 00:37:19.537]  It's like, there's nothing.
[00:37:19.557 --> 00:37:21.138]  First of all, it's Hunter Biden.
[00:37:21.178 --> 00:37:22.298]  Hey, hit pause again, I'm sorry.
[00:37:22.358 --> 00:37:23.179]  Start over from the beginning again.
[00:37:24.878 --> 00:37:36.484]  The corpses of children, like the 64 million starved to death under lockdowns worldwide, UN admits, or the actual giant child smuggling, or the kids he's actually having sex with, he's getting you ready, saying, I don't care about dead kids!
[00:37:36.824 --> 00:37:38.145]  I don't care about dead bodies!
[00:37:38.405 --> 00:37:40.166]  I don't care about basements full of dead kids!
[00:37:40.506 --> 00:37:42.267]  I care about Trump University!
[00:37:44.108 --> 00:37:45.389]  I don't care about nuclear war!
[00:37:45.769 --> 00:37:46.269]  I don't care!
[00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:48.731]  Remember the owner of the Warriors?
[00:37:50.051 --> 00:37:52.133]  Last year, or earlier this year, it was like January.
[00:37:53.054 --> 00:37:54.395]  Maybe find that clip for next segment.
[00:37:55.456 --> 00:37:58.719]  He said, I don't even think about the Uyghurs 3 million in death camps.
[00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:00.961]  They don't even register to me.
[00:38:02.142 --> 00:38:02.323]  What?
[00:38:02.383 --> 00:38:06.066]  They're just trying to get you like, yeah, so what?
[00:38:06.927 --> 00:38:07.888]  We got death camps.
[00:38:09.049 --> 00:38:10.690]  So what if there's dead bodies of kids?
[00:38:11.621 --> 00:38:12.141]  I'm going to stop.
[00:38:12.622 --> 00:38:13.863]  I'm going to stop now.
[00:38:13.883 --> 00:38:14.663]  Now play it front to back.
[00:38:14.703 --> 00:38:16.024]  Here it is.
[00:38:16.064 --> 00:38:21.848]  Hunter Biden, at that point, Hunter Biden literally could have had the corpses of children in his basement.
[00:38:22.609 --> 00:38:23.469]  I would not have cared.
[00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:25.271]  There's nothing.
[00:38:25.291 --> 00:38:27.032]  First of all, it's Hunter Biden.
[00:38:27.112 --> 00:38:27.792]  It's not Joe Biden.
[00:38:30.214 --> 00:38:53.315]   Even if whatever scope of Joe Biden's corruption is, if we could just go down that rabbit hole endlessly and understand that he's getting kickbacks from Hunter Biden's deals in Ukraine or wherever else, right, or China, it is Infinitesimal compared to the corruption we know Trump is involved in.
[00:38:53.535 --> 00:38:56.676]  It's like a firefly to the sun, right?
[00:38:57.236 --> 00:39:01.397]  It doesn't even stack up against Trump University, right?
[00:39:01.437 --> 00:39:08.279]  Trump University, as a story, is worse than anything that could be in Hunter Biden's laptop, in my view, right?
[00:39:08.899 --> 00:39:20.485]   Now, that doesn't answer the people who say it's still completely unfair To not have looked at the laptop in a timely way and to have shut down the New York Post's Twitter account.
[00:39:20.525 --> 00:39:26.709]  That's a left-wing conspiracy to deny the presidency to Donald Trump.
[00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:28.271]  Absolutely it was.
[00:39:28.551 --> 00:39:29.051]  Absolutely.
[00:39:29.872 --> 00:39:30.792]  But I think it was warranted.
[00:39:31.533 --> 00:39:35.476]  And again, it's a coin toss as to whether or not that particular piece is... Sam, I'm sorry.
[00:39:35.496 --> 00:39:36.176]  I'm really sorry.
[00:39:36.196 --> 00:39:40.359]  I was the one that said we should move on, but you've just said something I really struggle with, which is...
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.101]  The kids in the basement?
[00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:45.643]  No, no, fuck the kids in the basement.
[00:39:46.223 --> 00:39:47.464]  I'm interested in democracy.
[00:39:47.944 --> 00:39:55.689]  You're saying you're content with a left-wing conspiracy to prevent somebody being democratically re-elected as president.
[00:39:55.989 --> 00:39:57.090]  Well, no, I'm content.
[00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:59.131]  But the thing is, it's just not left-wing.
[00:39:59.411 --> 00:40:00.932]  So Liz Cheney is not left-wing.
[00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:01.372]  Right.
[00:40:01.692 --> 00:40:02.733]  Liz Cheney's doing everything in her power.
[00:40:02.753 --> 00:40:06.434]  You're content with a conspiracy to prevent somebody being democratically elected?
[00:40:06.454 --> 00:40:10.296]  No, but there's nothing... Conspiracy... It was a conspiracy out in the open.
[00:40:10.616 --> 00:40:15.037]  But it doesn't matter if it was... It doesn't matter what part's conspiracy, what part's out in the open.
[00:40:15.057 --> 00:40:16.118]  I mean, I think it's like...
[00:40:16.838 --> 00:40:33.107]  If people get together and talk about what should we do about this phenomenon, if there was an asteroid hurtling toward Earth, and we got in a room together with all of our friends and had a conversation about what we could do to deflect its course, right?
[00:40:33.867 --> 00:40:34.688]  Is that a conspiracy?
[00:40:36.149 --> 00:40:38.010]  So they're the ones saying the world's gonna end.
[00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.611]  They're the ones cutting off the resources.
[00:40:40.051 --> 00:40:41.512]  They're the ones de-industrializing.
[00:40:41.572 --> 00:40:42.412]  They're the asteroid.
[00:40:43.433 --> 00:40:51.874]   And then, It's okay because Liz Cheney, the daughter of the warmonger, arch-villain... It's like, oh, it's Liz Cheney!
[00:40:51.954 --> 00:40:53.934]  I mean, okay, well, I mean, alright then.
[00:40:55.475 --> 00:41:09.020]  This is just a foppish, fake intellectual fraud up there trying to sell you on just accepting tyranny and doing what you want because you're the good guys.
[00:41:11.445 --> 00:41:30.877]  Alright folks, we're going to come back and start the next hour, and I intend to open the phones up and cover all the other news I haven't hit yet on the military, on Putin, big developments there, on the poison shots, big developments with Marjorie Taylor Greene introducing legislation to ban the mutilation and the sterilization of children.
[00:41:31.237 --> 00:41:34.799]  We've got a big, big second hour lined up for you.
[00:41:34.839 --> 00:41:38.422]  Please don't forget, we're not backed by George Soros, the new ruler, we're backed by you.
[00:41:38.442 --> 00:41:39.863]  I want to thank all our backers.
[00:41:40.783 --> 00:41:42.604]  You need to get DNA Force Plus.

[00:42:06.895 --> 00:42:08.496]  It takes a lot of money to fight the New World Order.
[00:42:08.516 --> 00:42:09.976]  If you want to fight, support us.

[00:43:02.242 --> 00:43:03.202]  That's your DNA.
[00:43:03.962 --> 00:43:05.583]  This product is amazing.
[00:43:05.643 --> 00:43:12.744]  It blows away all the competition and it's even more incredible because it funds our operation against the New World Order.
[00:43:13.084 --> 00:43:15.365]  You can buy some great supplements out there from great companies.
[00:43:15.905 --> 00:43:17.166]  But are they funding the tip of the spear?
[00:43:17.587 --> 00:43:18.127]  No, they're not.
[00:43:18.527 --> 00:43:27.715]  So if you haven't experienced DNA Force Plus yourself, or in the last year when it's been sold out you couldn't get it, it's finally back in stock at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:43:28.136 --> 00:43:33.801]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off, 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:43:35.122 --> 00:43:36.323]  Law and order.
[00:43:36.663 --> 00:43:39.406]  You see it on the streets of our cities, you see it at our southern border.
[00:43:39.526 --> 00:43:40.547]  It's collapsed.
[00:43:41.607 --> 00:43:55.050]  So if you're a Republican voter, and not just a Republican voter, any voter, you probably want to know, what is the government going to do about the fact that I can call 911 and no one shows up?
[00:43:55.070 --> 00:44:03.691]  What are you going to do about the fact that our border is open to the world and that millions of them have come in illegally?
[00:44:04.231 --> 00:44:07.672]  How can you take the country seriously when it doesn't even have a border?
[00:44:08.649 --> 00:44:09.330]  And it doesn't.
[00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:14.377]  And we know that because on video, every single day, people stream in.
[00:44:15.519 --> 00:44:18.282]  Fox's Bill Mlugen just caught the whole thing, once again, on camera.
[00:44:19.465 --> 00:44:21.966]  Take a look at this video we shot yesterday where we're standing.
[00:44:22.006 --> 00:44:24.087]  This is the first time we had ever seen this.
[00:44:24.467 --> 00:44:28.469]  The Texas National Guard closed and locked a gate on this property.
[00:44:28.509 --> 00:44:33.951]  It's a major crossing area and they blocked the illegal immigrants from being able to come into this property.
[00:44:34.051 --> 00:44:35.032]  It's private property.
[00:44:35.092 --> 00:44:40.974]  The owner allows the National Guard and Border Patrol to work here, but you can see illegal immigrants started showing up.
[00:44:41.074 --> 00:44:41.935]  They weren't let in.
[00:44:41.975 --> 00:44:45.276]  They expected to be let in and they were surprised they couldn't get in.
[00:44:45.336 --> 00:44:46.196]  Here's what happened though.
[00:44:46.256 --> 00:44:47.257]  Take a look at this video.
[00:44:47.677 --> 00:44:54.021]  Border Patrol showed up, a supervisor came with a key, opened up that gate, and let all of those illegal immigrants in.
[00:44:54.361 --> 00:44:58.944]  Symbolic of the way the state of Texas handles things versus the way the federal government handles things.
[00:45:00.746 --> 00:45:08.611]  So if every Republican candidate has repeated, repeat after me, law enforcement, law and order, is not racist.
[00:45:09.131 --> 00:45:12.113]  Law and order is a prerequisite for civilization.
[00:45:12.693 --> 00:45:14.775]  And if it goes away, so does the country.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:22.967]  You would win the votes not simply of your own voters, but of a lot of other voters and people who have never voted before.
[00:45:23.227 --> 00:45:26.490]  And any normal Democrat would agree with that because it's inherently true.
[00:45:26.831 --> 00:45:27.992]  But it's the opposite of what we have.
[00:45:28.532 --> 00:45:38.382]  When Ann Coulter saw the video we just played, she noted correctly that it's easier to get into this country as an illegal alien than it is to return as an American citizen back into JFK.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:43.804]  By the way, the people you saw are the ones who just want to be caught.
[00:45:43.864 --> 00:45:46.429]  They're turning themselves in so they can get bused to your town.
[00:45:46.449 --> 00:45:52.859]  There are a lot of people who don't want to be caught, and those people are bringing in fentanyl, which is killing thousands of Americans every month.
[00:45:53.905 --> 00:45:55.547]  It's been a busy few weeks for U.S.
[00:45:55.587 --> 00:45:57.989]  Customs and Border Protection officers in Nogales.
[00:45:58.289 --> 00:46:08.740]  At the checkpoint on Saturday, they found 2.5 pounds of black tar heroin, 9 pounds of heroin, 89 pounds of meth, and 320,000 fentanyl pills.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:14.505]  Later that day, another huge bust, including more than 40 pounds of drugs and 150,000 fentanyl pills hidden in a car.
[00:46:16.167 --> 00:46:20.289]  Border officials say people are becoming more creative in the ways they smuggle items through.
[00:46:20.609 --> 00:46:25.771]  In one case, someone tried to hide 10,000 fentanyl pills using a body-shaping garment.
[00:46:27.692 --> 00:46:28.993]  Everybody knows this is happening.
[00:46:29.533 --> 00:46:31.034]  This is not hidden information.
[00:46:31.054 --> 00:46:32.354]  These are not the Gnostic Gospels.
[00:46:32.955 --> 00:46:35.856]  Every American citizen knows exactly what's happening.
[00:46:37.156 --> 00:46:42.999]  And yet the leaders of the Republican Party, Mitch McConnell, will watch footage like that and tell you, you know, the most important issue that we face?
[00:46:43.339 --> 00:46:44.500]  Territorial integrity of Ukraine.
[00:46:45.629 --> 00:46:51.794]  And at the same breath, there's nothing the Republican Party can do to avert historic humiliation in the midterm elections.
[00:46:51.834 --> 00:46:57.599]  But the truth, as you well know, is that the people who run the Republican Party don't actually want to do anything about it.
[00:46:57.619 --> 00:46:59.401]  There are candidates who are talking about this stuff.
[00:46:59.641 --> 00:46:59.881]  J.D.
[00:46:59.962 --> 00:47:04.666]  Vance in Ohio, Blake Masters in Arizona, Joe Kent in the Pacific Northwest.
[00:47:05.807 --> 00:47:15.191]   The leaders of the Republican Party in Washington would rather those guys lose, and people like them lose, Then change the focus of the party to issues that voters actually care about.
[00:47:16.191 --> 00:47:18.693]  But the truth is, you can't win elections unless you listen to voters.
[00:47:18.713 --> 00:47:19.994]  They're telling you what they want.
[00:47:21.195 --> 00:47:27.639]  Republicans have less than three months to figure this very simple riddle out, or it's going to be an actual disaster.
[00:47:28.299 --> 00:47:29.820]  Stephen Miller has been following this since the beginning.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.501]  He's a former senior White House advisor.
[00:47:31.541 --> 00:47:32.402]  He joins us tonight.
[00:47:32.762 --> 00:47:34.163]  Stephen Miller, thanks so much for coming on.
[00:47:34.423 --> 00:47:36.265]  This seems like the simplest formula ever.
[00:47:36.525 --> 00:47:37.946]  Every normal person hates crime.
[00:47:37.966 --> 00:47:40.007]  You'd really have to be Kamala Harris to want more crime.
[00:47:40.287 --> 00:47:41.128]  Why aren't they running on this?
[00:47:42.159 --> 00:47:44.581]  They're not running on it for the reasons you identified.
[00:47:45.101 --> 00:47:47.924]  Joe Biden is the most unpopular president in American history.
[00:47:48.184 --> 00:47:53.388]  We should be looking at the largest midterm victory for Republicans likewise in American history.
[00:47:53.768 --> 00:47:55.710]  And instead the forecasts are shrinking.
[00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:57.391]  That's right, Stephen Miller's right.
[00:47:57.411 --> 00:48:01.175]  The Republicans are taking a dive on purpose other than Trump, folks.
[00:48:01.875 --> 00:48:02.616]  It's disgusting.
[00:48:02.656 --> 00:48:05.538]  We'll be tracking it all with 81 days out from the midterms.
[00:48:05.958 --> 00:48:08.660]  Straight ahead, your phone calls, special guests, and more.
[00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:09.221]  Stay with us.
[00:48:09.521 --> 00:48:12.043]  Greg Reese will be in studio, the one, the only.
[00:48:12.063 --> 00:48:13.184]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:48:13.564 --> 00:48:14.965]  We are the InfoWar.
[00:48:16.006 --> 00:48:18.028]  We are now into hour number two.
[00:48:18.068 --> 00:48:21.450]  Before I hit all the latest massive news, open the phones up and take your calls.
[00:48:22.011 --> 00:48:24.032]  I have Greg Reese in studio next hour.
[00:48:24.052 --> 00:48:26.654]  I want to play a clip from the vault.
[00:48:28.055 --> 00:48:28.436]  April 2020.
[00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:36.282]  And a clip from July 2021 where I predicted exactly what would happen with the poison death shots.
[00:48:37.202 --> 00:48:51.928]  Understand it is a 100% undebated absolute fact that they have never guessed the right flu virus for the mutation of what the main flu is the next year.
[00:48:52.108 --> 00:48:54.309]  And it's always a whole bunch of flus, dozens and dozens of them.
[00:48:54.949 --> 00:48:59.611]  And that it does nothing to protect you from the next flu if it's not the exact flu!
[00:49:01.738 --> 00:49:04.479]  That's why they never ask why they don't have a vaccine for the common cold.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:05.920]  Because it's too varied.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.421]  Because there's thousands of them.
[00:49:07.701 --> 00:49:09.682]  And because you have to get it exactly right.
[00:49:09.942 --> 00:49:11.423]  And viruses are always mutating.
[00:49:11.563 --> 00:49:13.404]  But you notice they're telling you they've got a vaccine.
[00:49:13.744 --> 00:49:17.046]  They want you willingly to go take whatever it is that's gonna be in there.
[00:49:17.526 --> 00:49:20.147]  The coronavirus mutates more than flu viruses.
[00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:22.028]  You have to get the exact mutation.
[00:49:21.969 --> 00:49:24.969]  So it'll be a yearly injection, of course.
[00:49:24.969 --> 00:49:28.969]  [laughs]
[00:49:28.969 --> 00:49:29.969]  Ah!
[00:49:29.969 --> 00:49:31.969]  Oh, and all the social distancing.
[00:49:32.549 --> 00:49:34.431]  You haven't had your yearly or monthly shot.
[00:49:35.531 --> 00:49:38.313]  And so they didn't waste their time on a vaccine.
[00:49:39.442 --> 00:49:49.648]  It's SARS, which is a biological warfare agent in the first place, with gain-of-function to make it more lethal, more infectious.
[00:49:50.028 --> 00:49:51.549]  It has HIV in there.
[00:49:51.969 --> 00:49:54.950]  Of course we don't have a vaccine for HIV.
[00:49:55.631 --> 00:49:58.992]  We've tried for the last 20 years to get a vaccine for HIV.
[00:49:59.373 --> 00:50:01.634]  There is no vaccine for HIV.
[00:50:02.054 --> 00:50:05.175]  There's not going to be a vaccine for COVID-19.
[00:50:05.895 --> 00:50:11.357]  Even this French Nobel Prize winner in medicine has said the same thing.
[00:50:11.457 --> 00:50:14.038]  And now, like I told you a year ago, the vaccines won't protect you.
[00:50:14.058 --> 00:50:16.319]  Now they're saying, oh, magically they don't protect you.
[00:50:16.479 --> 00:50:19.200]  But a few months, you need new shots every few months.
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:35.070]  And Bill Gates says this is to upgrade and put the UN in charge and massively build giant vaccine production so much that you can be vaccinating seven and a half billion people once a month with new things, where you've got to have this new shot every month to be authorized to leave your house.
[00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:42.115]  But the thing is, there is absolutely no evidence or credible studies supporting any of what he just said.
[00:50:42.435 --> 00:50:43.776]  End of flashback.
[00:50:43.956 --> 00:50:48.019]  We had perhaps too little caution and too much optimism.
[00:50:48.739 --> 00:50:49.560]  Nobody said waning.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.722]  Now let's spend some time on Brian Stelter.
[00:50:51.742 --> 00:50:54.044]  Yeah, we can celebrate all day that he's been cancelled.
[00:50:54.084 --> 00:50:54.645]  He's a joke.
[00:50:54.665 --> 00:50:56.126]  But he had 100,000 viewers.
[00:50:56.006 --> 00:51:06.925]   said waning. Nobody said waning. Now let's spend some time on Brian Stelter. Yeah we
[00:51:06.925 --> 00:51:10.976]  can celebrate all day that he's been canceled. He's a joke.
[00:51:10.976 --> 00:51:17.365]   But he had a hundred thousand viewers. For cable news that's not even a pulse. He was
[00:51:17.365 --> 00:51:20.472]   good because he was waking people He was a laughing stock.
[00:51:20.512 --> 00:51:21.212]  He was a clown.
[00:51:21.613 --> 00:51:22.373]  He was a jester.
[00:51:22.413 --> 00:51:29.058]  He was an officious, self-serving, arrogant booby.
[00:51:30.059 --> 00:51:34.543]  He was the most shmug person you could imagine.
[00:51:34.583 --> 00:51:37.485]  That's the armor they wear, this fake pomposity.
[00:51:40.239 --> 00:51:41.740]  And so now he's been cancelled.
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.181]  Well, CNN cancelled itself.
[00:51:43.281 --> 00:51:50.767]  CNN spent 400 and something million dollars on CNN Plus and it failed in a month and a half, or less than that.
[00:51:50.787 --> 00:51:51.607]  It was like 40 days.
[00:51:53.969 --> 00:51:54.269]  Failed.
[00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:58.773]  Because no one wants them and that's why they need to censor all of us.
[00:51:59.093 --> 00:52:01.154]  Because people are hungry for the truth.
[00:52:01.455 --> 00:52:03.236]  They're hungry for unfiltered information.
[00:52:03.436 --> 00:52:05.518]  They're hungry to make up their own minds.
[00:52:07.011 --> 00:52:11.835]  So I've got more than 10 clips here of Stelter, and I don't want to go to your calls, but we do need to memorialize him.
[00:52:12.555 --> 00:52:13.416]  Let's start with clip 8.
[00:52:14.737 --> 00:52:20.922]  Four months ago, a college student asked Brian Stelter about the career of spreading fake news at CNN.
[00:52:21.542 --> 00:52:22.403]  He's since been ousted.
[00:52:22.423 --> 00:52:26.065]  This is, I think, the most powerful clip, calling out the emperor's new clothes.
[00:52:26.085 --> 00:52:26.426]  Here it is.
[00:52:28.912 --> 00:52:29.993]  Hi, thank you for coming.
[00:52:30.413 --> 00:52:31.493]  My name is Christopher Phillips.
[00:52:31.574 --> 00:52:32.774]  I'm a first year at the college.
[00:52:33.575 --> 00:52:34.755]  My question is for Mr. Seltzer.
[00:52:36.296 --> 00:52:43.600]  You've all spoken extensively about Fox News being a purveyor of disinformation, but CNN is right up there with them.
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:45.641]  They pushed the Russian collusion hoax.
[00:52:45.681 --> 00:52:47.282]  They pushed the Jussie Smollett hoax.
[00:52:47.962 --> 00:52:58.948]  They smeared Justice Kavanaugh as a rapist and they also smeared Nick Sandman as a white supremacist and yes, they dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop affair as pure Russian disinformation.
[00:52:59.728 --> 00:53:13.055]   With mainstream corporate journalists becoming little more than apologists and cheerleaders for the regime, is it time to finally declare that the The canon of journalistic ethics is dead or no longer operative.
[00:53:13.835 --> 00:53:20.278]  All the mistakes of the mainstream media, and CNN in particular, seem to magically all go in one direction.
[00:53:20.758 --> 00:53:25.560]  Are we expected to believe that this is all just some sort of random coincidence?
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:27.561]  Or is there something else behind it?
[00:53:30.677 --> 00:53:35.561]  Because you'll notice, Stelter says, yeah, right-wing disinfo claims all that.
[00:53:36.061 --> 00:53:37.923]  No, you did push the Russia hoax.
[00:53:37.963 --> 00:53:39.384]  You did push Jesse Smollett.
[00:53:39.684 --> 00:53:41.085]  You did push all those lies.
[00:53:42.286 --> 00:53:45.449]  But he just calls it disinfo, like calling you a conspiracy theorist.
[00:53:45.909 --> 00:53:51.774]  Instead of saying, hey, you're a liar, hey, you said this, he just says, no, you claim that.
[00:53:51.954 --> 00:53:53.135]  No, it's the truth.
[00:53:53.395 --> 00:53:54.216]  So here's the response.
[00:53:54.770 --> 00:54:03.401]  ...magically all go in one direction, are we expected to believe that this is all just some sort of random coincidence, or is there something else behind it?
[00:54:03.421 --> 00:54:05.503]  It's too bad, it's time for lunch!
[00:54:06.784 --> 00:54:07.724]  You have 30 seconds.
[00:54:07.744 --> 00:54:09.845]  No, I mean, there's a clock that says 30 seconds.
[00:54:09.885 --> 00:54:18.107]  But I think my honest answer to you, and I'll come over and talk in more detail after this, is that I think you're describing a different channel than the one that I watch.
[00:54:18.767 --> 00:54:21.748]  But I understand that that is a popular right-wing narrative about CNN.
[00:54:21.768 --> 00:54:28.290]  I think it's important, when we're talking about shared reality and democracy, all these networks, all these outlets have to defend democracy.
[00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:29.850]  And when they screw up, admit it.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:39.964]  But when Benjamin Hall, the Fox correspondent, was wounded in Ukraine, the news crews at CNN and the New York Times stopped what they were doing and they tried to help.
[00:54:40.304 --> 00:54:42.025]  So he uses an emotional story.
[00:54:42.045 --> 00:54:45.346]  We've got to censor people for democracy, the opposite of democracy.
[00:54:45.366 --> 00:54:51.529]  Then he uses a military story, how the media all works together because CNN was upset when somebody got wounded.
[00:54:52.089 --> 00:54:52.690]  What does that even mean?
[00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:55.131]  He diverts from the question.
[00:54:54.971 --> 00:54:55.971]  continue.
[00:54:55.971 --> 00:54:58.809]   All the country, they tried to find the dead crew members.
[00:54:58.809 --> 00:55:00.251]  That's what news outlets do.
[00:55:00.251 --> 00:55:04.070]   That's how they actually do work together to your question about sharing those kinds
[00:55:04.070 --> 00:55:05.851]  of connections and trust.
[00:55:05.851 --> 00:55:07.329]  We don't talk about it enough, though.
[00:55:07.329 --> 00:55:10.489]  We don't share that reality about how that happens.
[00:55:10.489 --> 00:55:13.329]   And with regards to the regime, I think you mean the President Biden.
[00:55:13.329 --> 00:55:16.751]   The last time I spoke with a Biden aide, we yelled at each other.
[00:55:16.751 --> 00:55:18.849]  So that's the reality of the news business.
[00:55:18.849 --> 00:55:21.489]  The people don't see, the people don't hear.
[00:55:21.489 --> 00:55:25.210]  They imagine that it's a situation that simply is not.
[00:55:25.210 --> 00:55:30.391]   But I think your question, it speaks to the failure of journalism to show our work and
[00:55:30.391 --> 00:55:33.391]  show the reality of how our profession operates.
[00:55:33.391 --> 00:55:36.570]  We have a lot of work to do, I think.
[00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:37.690]  You're a lying failure.
[00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:47.690]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:55:39.887 --> 00:55:46.339]  Okay, so let's play the late, great founder of the Weather Channel and meteorologist schooling Brian Stelter years ago.
[00:55:46.379 --> 00:55:46.760]  Here it is.
[00:55:47.361 --> 00:55:48.623]  First, let me bring in John Coleman.
[00:55:48.643 --> 00:55:49.865]  He's in San Diego this morning.
[00:55:50.266 --> 00:55:50.987]  Thank you for being here.
[00:55:52.073 --> 00:55:53.353]  It's nice to be on CNN.
[00:55:53.393 --> 00:55:54.754]  Hello to all your viewers.
[00:55:54.854 --> 00:55:56.914]  I resent you calling me a denier.
[00:55:57.314 --> 00:55:59.695]  That is a word meant to put me down.
[00:56:00.175 --> 00:56:02.116]  I'm a skeptic about climate change.
[00:56:02.456 --> 00:56:05.196]  And I want to make it darn clear, Mr. Kennedy is not a scientist.
[00:56:05.436 --> 00:56:05.777]  I am.
[00:56:06.097 --> 00:56:08.377]  He's the CEO of the Weather Channel now.
[00:56:08.957 --> 00:56:11.378]  I was the founder of the Weather Channel, not the co-founder.
[00:56:11.678 --> 00:56:14.079]  And I'm glad you did, because I am addicted to the Weather Channel.
[00:56:14.119 --> 00:56:14.739]  I watch a lot of cable news.
[00:56:14.759 --> 00:56:15.380]  You're not talking now.
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:16.380]  Hold on just a minute.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:16.980]  I'm not done.
[00:56:17.741 --> 00:56:25.464]  And CNN has taken a very strong position on global warming that it is a consensus.
[00:56:25.504 --> 00:56:27.685]  Well, there is no consensus in science.
[00:56:27.725 --> 00:56:28.786]  Science isn't a vote.
[00:56:29.386 --> 00:56:30.586]  Science is about facts.
[00:56:31.207 --> 00:56:36.040]   And if you get down to the hard, cold facts, There's no question about it.
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:38.341]  Climate change is not happening.
[00:56:38.761 --> 00:56:43.322]  There is no significant man-made global warming now.
[00:56:43.722 --> 00:56:47.303]  There hasn't been any in the past, and there's no reason to expect any in the future.
[00:56:47.723 --> 00:57:01.586]  There's a whole lot of baloney, and yes, it has become a big political point of the Democratic Party and part of their platform, and I regret it's become political instead of scientific, but the science is on my side.
[00:57:01.826 --> 00:57:04.607]  I don't think we're going to come to a conclusion about the topic right here.
[00:57:04.907 --> 00:57:11.908]  What I do wonder, though, is when you see... Well, I know we're not, because you wouldn't allow it to happen on CNN, but I'm happy that I got on the air and got a chance to talk to your viewers.
[00:57:11.928 --> 00:57:13.548]  We've been talking here for several minutes.
[00:57:13.588 --> 00:57:14.548]  Hello, everybody.
[00:57:14.568 --> 00:57:16.789]  There is no global warming.
[00:57:16.929 --> 00:57:23.190]  What I do want... So, the sea levels haven't rised a half inch in a hundred years.
[00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:27.271]  All these rich globalists like Bill Gates and Obama are buying oceanfront property.
[00:57:27.731 --> 00:57:28.551]  It ain't in Arizona.
[00:57:30.165 --> 00:57:30.846]  It's all a lie.
[00:57:31.626 --> 00:57:32.787]  We got more Stelter Clips.
[00:57:32.847 --> 00:57:33.968]  I can't help it, I gotta play them.
[00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:35.950]  But then, we're gonna go to your phone calls.
[00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:37.191]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-789-2539.
[00:57:37.211 --> 00:57:37.251]  877-789-2539.

[00:57:45.631 --> 00:57:55.711]   877-789-2539 on this live, Friday, free, global transmission of the people, the people, the people.
[00:57:55.711 --> 00:57:57.471]  It's Brian Stelter.
[00:57:57.657 --> 00:57:58.097]  There it is.
[00:57:58.277 --> 00:57:59.298]  Oh my God.
[00:57:59.818 --> 00:58:02.159]  I mean, that is a horror movie cover.
[00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:04.861]  Seriously, he is scarier looking than Hit the Clown.
[00:58:04.941 --> 00:58:08.863]  I mean, would you let your children anywhere near that psychopath?
[00:58:08.943 --> 00:58:11.245]  I mean, that is a psychopath right there.
[00:58:12.205 --> 00:58:13.226]  I mean, look at him.
[00:58:13.446 --> 00:58:13.966]  God.
[00:58:14.987 --> 00:58:16.888]  Oh, I mean, it just, it cries out.
[00:58:17.568 --> 00:58:19.710]  Danger, danger, alert, alert.
[00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:21.251]  I am a scumbag.
[00:58:21.651 --> 00:58:22.411]  I am filth.
[00:58:22.651 --> 00:58:23.352]  I am your enemy.
[00:58:24.446 --> 00:58:30.927]  I would literally not be able to finish my dinner if somebody walked over and talked to me that looked like these two guys.
[00:58:31.247 --> 00:58:31.748]  And I'm sorry.
[00:58:32.328 --> 00:58:37.589]  They're not just lying anti-American scumbags that want to run us all on the ground because they're little men!
[00:58:37.709 --> 00:58:38.509]  They're pieces of crap!
[00:58:38.909 --> 00:58:41.750]  They think they're better than everybody!
[00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:42.930]  That's what it's about!
[00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:44.470]  It's the spirit of evil!
[00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:47.131]  We must break them!
[00:58:48.072 --> 00:58:52.494]  I've tried to do joke photos like this to look disingenuous, and I can make any face I want to.
[00:58:52.514 --> 00:58:54.254]  I can't pull it off.
[00:58:54.734 --> 00:58:56.395]  Because the eyes, Chico.
[00:58:56.955 --> 00:58:58.075]  It's always in the eyes.
[00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:00.216]  Oh!
[00:59:00.936 --> 00:59:01.337]  Oh!
[00:59:01.877 --> 00:59:03.137]  Oh my gosh!
[00:59:03.497 --> 00:59:03.637]  Oh!
[00:59:04.238 --> 00:59:05.258]  Hell on Earth!
[00:59:06.418 --> 00:59:07.739]  He wants to run your life.
[00:59:07.799 --> 00:59:10.100]  He wants to control every aspect of your life.
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:16.642]  Because he knows he is a cowardly, degenerate sack of anti-human trash.
[00:59:18.143 --> 00:59:24.624]  I pledge before my Heavenly Father that I will resist them every way I can.
[00:59:24.664 --> 00:59:29.765]  These people are the literal demon spawn of the pit of hell.
[00:59:29.905 --> 00:59:30.345]  Look at him!
[00:59:30.645 --> 00:59:31.105]  And you know what?
[00:59:31.325 --> 00:59:33.566]  He is better than you if you keep letting him run your life.
[00:59:33.966 --> 00:59:34.906]  He runs your kids.
[00:59:35.146 --> 00:59:36.086]  He runs the schools.
[00:59:36.306 --> 00:59:37.086]  He runs the banks.
[00:59:37.106 --> 00:59:37.766]  This guy!
[00:59:38.306 --> 00:59:38.927]  This spirit!
[00:59:39.187 --> 00:59:44.487]  This smiling, leering devil that thinks you can't see what he is!
[00:59:45.008 --> 00:59:47.008]  He is your enemy!
[00:59:47.768 --> 00:59:48.369]  Period!
[00:59:49.529 --> 00:59:54.893]  All the narcissistic devil-worshiping filth!
[00:59:54.953 --> 00:59:56.214]  I see you enemy!
[00:59:56.534 --> 00:59:57.715]  I see you enemy!
[00:59:58.195 --> 00:59:58.776]  Enemy!
[00:59:59.236 --> 00:59:59.736]  Enemy!
[00:59:59.997 --> 01:00:01.398]  You are my enemy!
[01:00:03.679 --> 01:00:06.481]  And I swear total resistance to you with everything I've got!
[01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:11.545]  Disingenuous, fake, false!
[01:00:12.452 --> 01:00:13.012]  Brokeback!
[01:00:13.533 --> 01:00:13.953]  Twisted!
[01:00:14.794 --> 01:00:15.474]  A defiler!
[01:00:15.794 --> 01:00:16.435]  A betrayer!
[01:00:16.835 --> 01:00:17.795]  A backstabber!
[01:00:18.596 --> 01:00:19.296]  A devil!
[01:00:22.859 --> 01:00:23.759]  You will pay.
[01:00:23.979 --> 01:00:25.701]  Yeah, you think I don't see your face, scum?
[01:00:25.881 --> 01:00:27.722]  You don't think I don't see you, Stelter?
[01:00:28.362 --> 01:00:29.863]  I see you, you understand me?
[01:00:29.883 --> 01:00:32.125]  I know what you think of me and my family.
[01:00:32.525 --> 01:00:33.786]  I see you right back.
[01:00:34.086 --> 01:00:34.987]  You understand that?
[01:00:35.127 --> 01:00:37.127]  You understand that, Delta?
[01:00:37.127 --> 01:00:41.127]  Yeah...
[01:00:41.127 --> 01:00:43.127]  Yes, Delta...
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.002]  YOU WILL NOT BRING HUMANITY DOWN!
[01:00:48.603 --> 01:00:51.605]  GOD IS GOING TO DESTROY YOU!
[01:00:53.767 --> 01:00:57.610]  Get him off the screen.
[01:00:57.930 --> 01:01:00.292]  Oh God, they're so evil!
[01:01:00.312 --> 01:01:02.193]  Just please God, free us from them!
[01:01:02.073 --> 01:01:09.073]  They're drunk on our children's blood for God's sake.
[01:01:09.073 --> 01:01:11.073]  [Explosion]
[01:01:11.073 --> 01:01:14.073]  [Laughter]
[01:01:14.073 --> 01:01:17.073]  Look at that face, man.
[01:01:17.143 --> 01:01:22.566]  He poses for photos, if you're a TV viewer, and radio listeners can't see it, you're lucky.
[01:01:23.527 --> 01:01:25.788]  This is, he thinks that's a good photo.
[01:01:26.048 --> 01:01:28.510]  He chose that in a press release of himself.
[01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:30.311]  That's who we're fighting.
[01:01:30.331 --> 01:01:31.492]  They're not all powerful.
[01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:32.372]  They're weak.
[01:01:33.453 --> 01:01:44.520]   And I can tell you, that little rant's not my best Brian Silver rant, but I'm told that that is shown in the newsrooms for years, every week, as The resistance.
[01:01:45.601 --> 01:01:47.323]  In fact, you want a little Tucker Carlson inside?
[01:01:47.383 --> 01:01:47.683]  Dope.
[01:01:49.785 --> 01:01:51.828]  That is required viewing at least once a week.
[01:01:55.882 --> 01:01:58.542]  So that's a little gift to Old Tucky.
[01:01:59.063 --> 01:02:06.444]  That little augmented piece, we added some new images and things to it from a rant like five, six years ago on Brian Stelter.
[01:02:06.484 --> 01:02:09.784]  But we, you know, we laugh at Brian Stelter and people make jokes of him.
[01:02:09.804 --> 01:02:11.105]  Here he is as an IRS agent.
[01:02:11.505 --> 01:02:12.585]  That's going to be his new job.
[01:02:13.305 --> 01:02:19.726]  But, I mean, this really is the example of the idiots that serve Satan and how they're thrown away at the end of the day.
[01:02:20.386 --> 01:02:21.326]  So let's play these clips.
[01:02:21.346 --> 01:02:21.987]  Let's play 6 and 10.
[01:02:24.907 --> 01:02:32.967]  This is Brian Stelter firing his nanny because you wouldn't take the poison shot, and him trying to brainwash children in New York about the COVID hysteria.
[01:02:33.007 --> 01:02:33.368]  Here it is.
[01:02:34.597 --> 01:02:36.758]  You know, me and my wife both work full time.
[01:02:36.778 --> 01:02:39.880]  We both make enough money to have a nanny during the day in New York.
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.061]  And our nanny refused to get vaccinated.
[01:02:43.641 --> 01:02:45.042]  And so we are parting ways with her.
[01:02:46.002 --> 01:02:53.866]  And it was very, very sad that we thought, after six months of seeing the vaccines are all good and everybody's fine, that she would come around.
[01:02:54.186 --> 01:02:59.169]  Do any of you feel like you try to correct friends or family now based on what you've learned?
[01:02:59.429 --> 01:02:59.649]  Yes.
[01:02:59.969 --> 01:03:00.149]  Really?
[01:03:00.189 --> 01:03:00.269]  Yeah.
[01:03:00.289 --> 01:03:03.571]  Do you all feel like every student needs to be learning news literacy?
[01:03:08.206 --> 01:03:13.569]  They're literally putting the general public into their mask-wearing, poison-shot-taking cult.
[01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:17.052]  And it's not Stelter that's bad.
[01:03:17.672 --> 01:03:23.796]  It's you and I that are bad when we let literal trash like this rule over us.
[01:03:23.856 --> 01:03:25.277]  But he is the archetype.
[01:03:25.317 --> 01:03:28.379]  He is the example of what we face.
[01:03:28.419 --> 01:03:33.722]  They want to silence us so they can have their way with our children.
[01:03:35.666 --> 01:03:36.327]  It's that simple.
[01:03:38.951 --> 01:03:43.659]  You know, we've got so many clips here, and I also want to go to your phone calls, but I want to end this segment with clip one.
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:04:03.412]  Here is the high priest of the Davos Group, Yuval Noah Harari, saying you're exempt from reality, saying you are non-essential, saying you're worthless, saying you're crap, saying that you should just step aside and let him control and dominate the future.
[01:04:03.812 --> 01:04:15.941]   Why would we sit here and let these people mind-control us, through Mad Stockholm Syndrome, to submit to these literal con-artist blobs That no one would even be friends with or like.
[01:04:16.621 --> 01:04:18.963]  Why do we let these people run our lives?
[01:04:19.984 --> 01:04:20.664]  Why do we do it?
[01:04:20.724 --> 01:04:22.245]  Well, that question is for you to answer.
[01:04:22.265 --> 01:04:26.268]  We're going to play this clip and come back from break and take your phone calls.
[01:04:26.288 --> 01:04:31.852]  But they are a bunch of pervert, twisted sickos who have no life of their own and who want to run your life.
[01:04:32.153 --> 01:04:33.414]  It's time to say no to them.
[01:04:34.835 --> 01:04:41.380]  It is critical because this is what convinces people to accept, to legitimize.
[01:04:42.659 --> 01:04:44.660]  Total biometric surveillance.
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.101]  We want to stop this epidemic.
[01:04:47.661 --> 01:04:53.363]  We need not just to monitor people, we need to monitor what's happening under their skin.
[01:04:53.583 --> 01:05:01.747]  What we have seen so far, it's corporations and governments collecting data about where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch.
[01:05:02.487 --> 01:05:07.012]  The next phase is the surveillance going under our skin.
[01:05:07.172 --> 01:05:14.359]  We now see mass surveillance systems established even in democratic countries, which previously rejected them.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.644]  And we also see a change in the nature of surveillance.
[01:05:19.284 --> 01:05:22.768]  Previously, surveillance was mainly above the skin.
[01:05:23.429 --> 01:05:25.231]  Now it's going under the skin.
[01:05:26.283 --> 01:05:33.945]  Governments want to know not just where we go or who we meet, above all they want to know what is happening under our skin.
[01:05:34.566 --> 01:05:35.786]  What's our body temperature?
[01:05:36.166 --> 01:05:37.246]  What's our blood pressure?
[01:05:37.346 --> 01:05:38.767]  What is our medical condition?
[01:05:39.167 --> 01:05:45.831]   Now humans are developing Even bigger powers than ever before.
[01:05:46.171 --> 01:05:51.075]  We are really acquiring divine powers of creation and destruction.
[01:05:51.675 --> 01:05:54.478]  We are really upgrading humans into gods.
[01:05:54.998 --> 01:05:58.221]  We are acquiring, for instance, the power to re-engineer life.
[01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:10.911]   I know that in recent years we saw populist politicians Undermining deliberately the trust that people have in important institutions like universities, like respectable media outlets.
[01:06:11.191 --> 01:06:19.217]  These populist politicians told people that, say, scientists are this small elite disconnected from the real people.
[01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:24.281]  I mean, all this story about Jesus rising from the dead and being the Son of God, this is fake news.
[01:06:24.501 --> 01:06:26.983]  Humans are now hackable animals.
[01:06:28.496 --> 01:06:44.485]  You know, the whole idea that humans have, you know, this, they have this soul or spirit, and they have free will, and nobody knows what's happening inside me, so whatever I choose, whether in the election, or whether in the supermarket, this is my free will, that's over.
[01:06:45.446 --> 01:06:47.547]  It's the one and the only, InfoWars.
[01:06:47.907 --> 01:06:51.689]  That's all our guests, all our listeners, all our callers, you are the InfoWar.
[01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:54.091]  And again, I thank you and salute you for all you've done.
[01:06:56.061 --> 01:07:03.197]  All right, I got a ton of news, and I've done a decent job, I think, in the last hour and a half covering 50, 60 articles and a lot of clips.
[01:07:04.608 --> 01:07:08.471]  But I want to go to your calls right now, wide open Friday phones.
[01:07:09.212 --> 01:07:14.857]  We have the great Greg Reese, great brain, great patriot for humanity joining us in studio next hour.
[01:07:14.877 --> 01:07:16.158]  We'll also take calls with him.
[01:07:16.759 --> 01:07:25.987]  I've got a bunch of military and economic news that's huge, a bunch of censorship news, a bunch of the left cities turning loose criminals, rapists, murderers, you name it.
[01:07:26.027 --> 01:07:27.328]  We've got a big stack of news on that.
[01:07:27.388 --> 01:07:30.391]  But I want to go to your phone calls right now.
[01:07:32.039 --> 01:07:33.800]  Because it's not just first-time callers today.
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:34.880]  I do that most of the time.
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:36.681]  It's whoever wants to call in.
[01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:42.283]  And I've interviewed Carlos, who's a political scientist and a successful businessman, as a guest several times.
[01:07:42.983 --> 01:07:45.144]  And he's been calling on the show for 16, 17 years.
[01:07:45.164 --> 01:07:46.184]  He's first up.
[01:07:46.684 --> 01:07:47.905]  Carlos in Canada.
[01:07:47.925 --> 01:07:52.247]  W-E-F equals globalist economy and the missing piece.
[01:07:52.327 --> 01:07:53.427]  Carlos, thanks for calling.
[01:07:54.307 --> 01:07:55.428]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:07:56.188 --> 01:07:58.569]  It really goes back a long time.
[01:07:58.949 --> 01:08:01.490]  And it is so many events over history.
[01:08:01.983 --> 01:08:07.527]  That, you know, there's not enough time to cover on InfoWars the real story, but it's all linked together.
[01:08:08.348 --> 01:08:12.772]  At one level, it's spiritual because it's the Antichrist against Christianity.
[01:08:13.412 --> 01:08:36.843]   At the next level is the realization that societies have economies and their people could take advantage of the need to feed the people and to have an economy of resources, economy of procreation, an economy, without going into Darwinian theory, You can actually account for the fact that people have to eat and take care of their society.
[01:08:36.903 --> 01:08:40.465]  And of course... They're removing the human economy.
[01:08:41.526 --> 01:08:44.067]  What they're removing is culture.
[01:08:44.428 --> 01:08:49.891]  They're removing the link between, the maternal link between the mother and child.
[01:08:50.392 --> 01:08:52.253]  The maternal instinct.
[01:08:52.653 --> 01:08:54.294]  The societal need to come together.
[01:08:54.654 --> 01:08:58.377]  The economy that is based on trade and on trust.
[01:08:59.016 --> 01:09:06.840]  And all those things that keep together were put into a religious context in all natures and all cultures of all different origins.
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:18.566]  These people are attacking with a fundamental reason, and the fundamental reason is that they have to prevail over you because that's their narrow-minded materialism.
[01:09:19.426 --> 01:09:30.977]  And the whole history, if you want to call it a religious split, between the biblical theme that divides all the stories of the Bible, is spiritual life versus material life.
[01:09:31.437 --> 01:09:35.281]  These people have found the power of the economy and the control of money.
[01:09:35.801 --> 01:09:40.466]  And that is the God of Mammon, as some people call it, but in reality it's a continuous story.
[01:09:40.914 --> 01:09:56.187]  Now, it comes to a climax over history and several times has been thwarted by those very principles of maternal instinct, societal need, and what is called in various cultures and in various locations, by area, a constitution.
[01:09:56.727 --> 01:10:09.630]  The solution to America today, which is the last bastion, I believe, of freedom, because all the rest has been a history of how to turn the world into the third world versus the first world, with no middle income society.
[01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:15.912]  The last bastion, of course, is the West, which is democratic and has an economic distribution.
[01:10:16.412 --> 01:10:21.413]  Now, that would become the third world, according to this machinery of money-making.
[01:10:21.883 --> 01:10:39.749]  And so, the Constitution of the United States is their last bastion, and of course that's what they're trying to destroy, and destroy you, and internally they cannot do it, because people turn to the Constitution, like Governor DeSantis, and I guess President Trump, must of course, if he doesn't do it, then we're finished.
[01:10:40.009 --> 01:10:41.230]  Well, beautifully said, my friend.
[01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:41.930]  I appreciate your call.
[01:10:41.970 --> 01:10:42.811]  Let's talk to Rob in Oregon.
[01:10:42.831 --> 01:10:43.972]  Rob, you're on the air.
[01:10:44.012 --> 01:10:44.392]  Hi, Alex.
[01:10:44.212 --> 01:10:48.772]   and work from there from George Washington to Jefferson to Lincoln to
[01:10:48.772 --> 01:10:55.092]   John F Kennedy who are all in many ways victims okay to today.
[01:10:55.092 --> 01:11:00.891]   Well beautifully said my friend I appreciate your call. Let's talk to Rob
[01:11:00.891 --> 01:11:08.492]   in Oregon. Rob you're on the air. Hi Alex good to talk to you sir. Yes sir. I wanted
[01:11:08.492 --> 01:11:13.492]   to say I'm very excited when your new book comes out at the end of the month.
[01:11:11.572 --> 01:11:21.839]  Now, I admit that I normally read Kindle books and am highly addicted to the internet, and my cell phone is always with me like so many of us are.
[01:11:22.499 --> 01:11:29.878]   By ordering your hard book, and I can't wait to read the physical book, it made me have an epiphany that I'm so bombarded with information, I'll admit.
[01:11:29.978 --> 01:11:32.479]  I'm in a trance of a low attention span.
[01:11:32.659 --> 01:11:34.520]  Now, you read so much, sir.
[01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.580]  You digest so much information.
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:50.986]  I would love if you could share with me and the audience how you find so much time to read suggestions on how we can use the internet, use our cell phones in a way that promotes enlightenment, but also a way that promotes a long-term attention span.
[01:11:51.606 --> 01:11:59.609]   Do you speed read or what would you recommend to focus our attention span so we can Take the time to read entire books.
[01:11:59.869 --> 01:12:01.390]  Do we have a cyber-free Sunday?
[01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:02.511]  Get away from the internet.
[01:12:02.611 --> 01:12:07.596]  How do you recommend, because it's a strong part of the information war, to manage information, sir?
[01:12:07.716 --> 01:12:10.178]  Well, when you study the globalists, it's a really good question.
[01:12:10.198 --> 01:12:11.179]  We could talk for days about it.
[01:12:11.199 --> 01:12:14.162]  You could have an old college course on it or an old degree in it.
[01:12:15.882 --> 01:12:18.305]  They have the same programs over and over again.
[01:12:18.325 --> 01:12:22.570]  So once you know their operations, you just see the same permutation of it over and over again.
[01:12:22.590 --> 01:12:23.311]  So that's not hard.
[01:12:23.591 --> 01:12:25.133]  You're like, oh, I've seen this press release before.
[01:12:25.173 --> 01:12:25.994]  I've seen that before.
[01:12:26.394 --> 01:12:28.096]  There's only a few dozen things they do.
[01:12:28.136 --> 01:12:30.900]  There's only a few dozen plays they have.
[01:12:31.961 --> 01:12:32.962]  But really what I do is...
[01:12:34.801 --> 01:13:10.287]   I scan Infowars, I scan a bunch of mainline sites, I scan legislation, I go and look at what Jack Posobiec is saying, I look at what Mike Cernovich is saying, I look at what Ron Paul is saying, what Senator Paul is saying, I look at what DeSantis is saying, and I just quickly scan through all of that, but I already know the globalist agenda from reading their books, reading Klaus Schwab's statements, and knowing what they're doing, and I really go back to The key books written by the population controllers and the statements put out by Brzezinski and the books written by Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger and the program.
[01:13:11.068 --> 01:13:15.470]  And so once you know that, it's pretty much reading the same thing over and over again.
[01:13:15.490 --> 01:13:17.571]  And so that's where we are.
[01:13:17.731 --> 01:13:21.733]  Lawlessness, collapse of society, that's how they want to beat us.
[01:13:22.114 --> 01:13:29.463]   And so it's a very good question of how do you How do you go through the different layers of the onion and not get distracted by everything that's going on?
[01:13:29.524 --> 01:13:33.808]  There's a global government cutting off the resources, training us for dystopia.
[01:13:34.268 --> 01:13:35.089]  It's not our friend.
[01:13:35.149 --> 01:13:35.830]  We should oppose it.
[01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:36.571]  It's really that simple.
[01:13:39.234 --> 01:13:39.914]  Okay, thank you.
[01:13:39.974 --> 01:13:42.337]  And then just one follow-up point.
[01:13:43.047 --> 01:13:49.453]  When I get your book, I'm going to have the exercise of reading the physical book cover to cover, and I don't care how many hours it takes.
[01:13:49.513 --> 01:13:50.494]  I'm really looking forward to it.
[01:13:50.994 --> 01:13:56.659]  Do you speed read, or do you have suggestions on how, because I happen to analyze like every sentence as I'm reading.
[01:13:56.699 --> 01:13:58.721]  I love to read, but I read at a very slow pace.
[01:13:59.121 --> 01:14:06.168]  Do you have recommendations on how to maybe up our reading focus and reading time, speed reading, any suggestions on how to improve on that?
[01:14:07.031 --> 01:14:12.455]  Yes, I speed read news, and then when I do read books, I tend to read them quickly and then slow down on certain points.
[01:14:13.656 --> 01:14:16.938]  But so much of The Great Reset and The War for the World is just their quotes.
[01:14:17.939 --> 01:14:19.280]  So it's really their confession.
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:24.043]  And so that's why people are blown away that have read the book is they're like, God, this is horrible.
[01:14:25.344 --> 01:14:28.106]  And half the book is just, it's just their statement.
[01:14:28.146 --> 01:14:29.207]  So it was very easy to write.
[01:14:29.787 --> 01:14:38.882]   The problem was cutting it down, because there's such a volume of Criminal Confession, thanks for the call, Bob.
[01:14:38.882 --> 01:14:43.342]   And yeah, people really like the book, and I think it's the best book out there.
[01:14:43.342 --> 01:14:47.742]   But the best book on the Great Reset of the New World Order currently, but that's not saying much.
[01:14:47.742 --> 01:14:51.881]   I mean, this is a small portion of their criminal admissions.
[01:14:51.881 --> 01:14:53.521]  These people love to brag.
[01:14:53.521 --> 01:14:57.442]   And so when you're reading this, you're reading their plan to enslave you,
[01:14:57.442 --> 01:14:58.480]  their plan to take you over.
[01:14:58.480 --> 01:15:03.582]   And by the way, we could probably finance InfoWars just on signed books at this point.
[01:15:03.582 --> 01:15:04.582]  We are.
[01:15:04.712 --> 01:15:07.235]  We've got 10,000 orders for signed books.
[01:15:07.395 --> 01:15:08.396]  I'm going to sign them all.
[01:15:08.416 --> 01:15:10.819]  I don't know how I'm going to do it.
[01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:15.667]  And so I've got the next few days to stop taking orders for signed books.
[01:15:16.307 --> 01:15:17.367]  Because I'm going to sign these books.
[01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:22.008]  So if you want a signed book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, Infowarstore.com.
[01:15:22.308 --> 01:15:23.169]  It's a fundraiser.
[01:15:23.649 --> 01:15:24.569]  It's to keep us on air.
[01:15:24.629 --> 01:15:25.849]  I want to thank you all.
[01:15:25.869 --> 01:15:27.069]  I want to buy the book for 24 bucks.
[01:15:27.089 --> 01:15:28.590]  You can get that as well unsigned.
[01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:29.310]  It's a hardcover.
[01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:34.191]  It really is the critical historic book in our modern age to own.
[01:15:34.651 --> 01:15:38.032]  It is the enemy's own announcement of your enslavement and destruction.
[01:15:38.852 --> 01:15:43.057]  And so you have their blueprint, you have their gauntlet being thrown down.
[01:15:43.617 --> 01:15:45.960]  The book is available at Infowarshore.com.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:54.710]  I'll probably announce Monday or Tuesday, signed copies are over because, I mean, I'm going to be in here signing, I don't know how I'm going to sign like a thousand books a day.
[01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:57.733]  The books showed up today, by the way, at an 18-wheeler.
[01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:58.274]  20,000 of them.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.460]  So I'm going to be signing them.
[01:16:01.061 --> 01:16:04.022]  And it's been the number five or six on Amazon.
[01:16:04.102 --> 01:16:04.702]  It's exploded.
[01:16:05.062 --> 01:16:10.704]  By the way, what we do have ready to ship is DNA Force Plus 50% off for your immune system and body.
[01:16:10.744 --> 01:16:11.644]  DNA Force Plus.
[01:16:12.004 --> 01:16:13.465]  Back at stockinfo.com.
[01:16:13.505 --> 01:16:14.145]  Call straight ahead.
[01:16:15.565 --> 01:16:20.007]  Nancy Pelosi has been caught in big time Taiwanese insider trading.
[01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:21.928]  That's coming up, start of the next hour.
[01:16:22.008 --> 01:16:23.568]  And Greg Reese in studio.
[01:16:25.869 --> 01:16:28.670]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday edition.
[01:16:29.525 --> 01:16:31.507]  All right, let's go right back to your phone calls.
[01:16:32.408 --> 01:16:34.249]  Devin in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:35.691]  You say the New World Order's here.
[01:16:36.171 --> 01:16:36.772]  I agree with you.
[01:16:38.193 --> 01:16:40.555]  Yeah, so Alex, first of all, it's great speaking with you.
[01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:44.719]  I loved the previous two callers, great commentary and questions.
[01:16:45.219 --> 01:17:06.844]   I just really want to bring encouragement to our listeners, and I appreciate what you do in bringing us things, you know, that bring their plot, you know, they bring out But there's really a great spiritual awakening I believe that God wants to bring to this nation and to the world, and we must remember that the people that we're dealing with right now are spiritually dark and dead, and it's going to take the fire of the Holy Ghost.
[01:17:08.126 --> 01:17:08.906]  No, I agree with you.
[01:17:08.926 --> 01:17:10.608]  The spiritual awakening is massive.
[01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:13.074]  And it's going to be a movement of prayer.
[01:17:13.094 --> 01:17:21.536]  I mean, it really, I'll tell you, for any believer out there reading the book of Acts, you know, I mean, when they were persecuted greatly, they had a company of believers they got together with.
[01:17:22.136 --> 01:17:27.817]  They prayed, and it says the place in which they were praying was shaken, and they went out with boldness even further.
[01:17:27.837 --> 01:17:30.897]  So the persecution really can't stop the church.
[01:17:31.157 --> 01:17:33.878]  And by the way, what they did echoes through time.
[01:17:33.918 --> 01:17:35.538]  We can feel their prayer today.
[01:17:36.598 --> 01:17:37.118]  Absolutely.
[01:17:37.739 --> 01:17:40.119]  And I believe just there's a movement that's going to come.
[01:17:41.049 --> 01:17:46.854]  You know, again, I appreciate what you do, and I know that you speak about Jesus, and I just want to remind people to not give up hope.
[01:17:47.635 --> 01:17:50.718]  There really is an answer out there, but we have to keep fighting.
[01:17:50.758 --> 01:17:53.940]  We must operate in discernment, I believe, in these days.
[01:17:54.421 --> 01:17:55.362]  We must prepare our house.
[01:17:55.382 --> 01:17:56.302]  That's what I'm telling my friends.
[01:17:56.363 --> 01:18:00.306]  I say, you've got to do what you can naturally to prepare your house, but also spiritually.
[01:18:00.326 --> 01:18:01.407]  You've got to prepare your house.
[01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:06.565]  No, I totally agree, and I'm going to tell a personal story right now I've never told, because the Holy Spirit wants me to.
[01:18:07.205 --> 01:18:16.109]  There's been three times in my life where I was under incredible attack, and I went to see my dad, and where we prayed, and literally, within hours, it happened.
[01:18:16.549 --> 01:18:22.792]  And there's something really special about believers coming together, but also men and women coming together, and family members.
[01:18:23.712 --> 01:18:36.470]   And I'm going to pray with my father this weekend for awakening and victory, and Because I don't know all the ways of God, but it's just powerful.
[01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:44.093]  Because our ancestors did so much before us, and by praying with your father or your mother, it connects to the people before you.
[01:18:45.785 --> 01:18:46.445]  And it's incredible.
[01:18:46.526 --> 01:18:49.848]  In fact, I'm going to pray with my father and my mother this weekend.
[01:18:50.188 --> 01:18:54.891]  Let's all confirm that we have fathers and mothers left with us or our family members.
[01:18:54.911 --> 01:19:01.276]  There's something particularly electromagnetically religious, spiritual about that.
[01:19:01.316 --> 01:19:02.657]  Do you hear what I'm saying?
[01:19:06.338 --> 01:19:08.338]  He's gone.
[01:19:08.338 --> 01:19:10.338]  [Sigh]
[01:19:10.338 --> 01:19:14.338]  Take him back to that place.
[01:19:14.338 --> 01:19:16.338]  Or I'll...
[01:19:15.837 --> 01:19:17.679]  I was really under attack like eight years ago.
[01:19:17.699 --> 01:19:20.241]  I was out with my dad's backyard by his pool.
[01:19:21.042 --> 01:19:22.464]  I said, Dad, I want you to pray with me.
[01:19:22.484 --> 01:19:24.906]  I remember he just put his hands in mine.
[01:19:28.429 --> 01:19:30.752]  And it was just like I knew when he made that prayer it was going to happen.
[01:19:30.772 --> 01:19:31.092]  It did.
[01:19:31.592 --> 01:19:33.014]  Because it was in alignment with God.
[01:19:34.635 --> 01:19:35.596]  And we have to do that now.
[01:19:35.616 --> 01:19:37.318]  My hands were just like this.
[01:19:37.358 --> 01:19:38.139]  He put his hands in mine.
[01:19:39.554 --> 01:19:44.782]  And we made the circuit of the past, the present, and the future.
[01:19:45.243 --> 01:19:48.848]  And that's why these Satanists hate us, because we have that power, and we're not using that power.
[01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:50.350]  Oh, man.
[01:19:53.014 --> 01:19:54.356]  Howie in New Jersey.
[01:19:54.396 --> 01:19:55.338]  Howie, thanks for calling.
[01:19:56.949 --> 01:20:03.511]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to say, like, the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha family that you talk about, they are an Rh-negative bloodline.
[01:20:03.551 --> 01:20:04.971]  They're actually from Ukraine.
[01:20:05.011 --> 01:20:05.912]  They're Scythians.
[01:20:06.192 --> 01:20:09.693]  They're what people call fallen angels, or how you say, fallen.
[01:20:10.373 --> 01:20:11.813]  And, um, that's where the Oxenatians come from.
[01:20:11.833 --> 01:20:12.613]  Well, it's funny you say that.
[01:20:12.633 --> 01:20:14.054]  They believe they're their own species.
[01:20:15.763 --> 01:20:18.144]  Yeah, I mean, they took over the Saxons of Germany.
[01:20:18.444 --> 01:20:19.705]  Like, the direction is right.
[01:20:19.725 --> 01:20:31.289]  I think they went from Ukraine to Germany, took over the Saxons, and the Anglos are the angels, the fallen angels, the demons that have merged into the actual, the true humans, or the true humanity.
[01:20:31.309 --> 01:20:33.010]  They've grafted themselves into it.
[01:20:33.450 --> 01:20:43.414]   And they took over the Netherlands, too, and that's where, like, the West India Company is pretty much The basis for the evil side of the American colonization, really.
[01:20:43.434 --> 01:20:50.037]  Like you say, Anderson Cooper is the extension of the Vanderbilts, and the Vanderbilts are just an extension of the West India Company.
[01:20:50.737 --> 01:20:53.918]  And I know parasites just live in colonies, even in your body.
[01:20:53.938 --> 01:20:58.560]  That's why they need to get your products, you know, get your parasite cleans and everything like that.
[01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:05.103]  Oh, there's no doubt, major studies out, they're colonizing our bodies with nanotech graphene oxide.
[01:21:05.163 --> 01:21:06.063]  What do you think that's about?
[01:21:07.992 --> 01:21:14.561]  I think it's just more support for the parasite to colonize your body so they can have more access over the body itself.
[01:21:15.141 --> 01:21:22.571]  I feel like they're just trying to make us, they want to control the breeding as much as possible and so they can get into the lineage so that we keep making the same mistakes.
[01:21:22.611 --> 01:21:23.853]  Because parasites live in loops.
[01:21:24.562 --> 01:21:27.224]  So if you look at any parasite life cycle, it's always in a loop.
[01:21:27.244 --> 01:21:34.388]  So they want to keep us in the same loop of the same mistakes and not learning from the history so that they can, you know, continue to propagate.
[01:21:34.508 --> 01:21:40.671]  And I just want to say that the best thing I feel like for parasites, again, is the cleansing and then breathwork and prayer, man.
[01:21:40.691 --> 01:21:42.993]  I always say, you know, breathwork plus prayer.
[01:21:43.013 --> 01:21:46.815]  You know, I tell people, you know, Casey Budd, breathwork on YouTube, man.
[01:21:47.115 --> 01:21:48.496]  That's all I really want to say, Alex, man.
[01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:51.297]  Psalm 23 plus breathwork, it changed your life.
[01:21:51.938 --> 01:21:52.778]  God bless you, brother.
[01:21:52.798 --> 01:21:53.359]  Thank you for the call.
[01:21:54.363 --> 01:21:55.544]  It's definitely spiritual war.
[01:21:57.166 --> 01:21:58.687]  Bart, in Georgia, you're on the air.
[01:21:58.727 --> 01:21:59.288]  Thanks for holding.
[01:22:00.228 --> 01:22:00.929]  Yes, Alex.
[01:22:00.989 --> 01:22:07.275]  I just wanted to say, I just spent 90% of my paycheck at InfowarsStore.com, but I wasted the rest of it.
[01:22:09.317 --> 01:22:10.298]  Well, you're beautiful, brother.
[01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:13.881]  We're definitely in direct war with the enemy, so thank you for keeping us on air.
[01:22:14.662 --> 01:22:20.707]  Anyway, I want to talk about Eagle Pass, Texas, where they, where it looks like, I believe it was National Guard, they stood down.
[01:22:20.747 --> 01:22:21.948]  That guy should be arrested.
[01:22:21.968 --> 01:22:24.910]  He should have defended that gate with deadly force.
[01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:26.691]  We need to find, what's this officer's name?
[01:22:26.812 --> 01:22:28.693]  I want a, I want a citizen's arrest.
[01:22:28.733 --> 01:22:29.574]  Whatever happened to that?
[01:22:29.934 --> 01:22:31.775]  We need to shut the Border Patrol down.
[01:22:31.795 --> 01:22:33.457]  If they're not going to do their job, get rid of them.
[01:22:33.757 --> 01:22:40.242]  And for those that are on radio and didn't know about this, we're showing footage for a team of yours, but tell folks what's happening.
[01:22:40.402 --> 01:22:43.725]  The military closes the gate and the Border Patrol orders it open.
[01:22:44.702 --> 01:22:48.303]  Yeah, but the military stood down and just let them open the damn gate.
[01:22:49.503 --> 01:22:50.284]  They didn't do anything.
[01:22:51.204 --> 01:22:53.445]  Which is a message to the world, flood us now.
[01:22:54.625 --> 01:22:59.546]  Well, we need to get like hundreds of thousands of patriots on the border.
[01:22:59.566 --> 01:23:06.748]  You could be out there selling hamburgers for a hundred bucks and take cash and be a fundraiser at the same time, but we need action now.
[01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:08.529]  The government's not going to help us.
[01:23:09.758 --> 01:23:14.061]  The government is actively imploding the third world and flooding us at the same time.
[01:23:14.402 --> 01:23:21.447]  I don't blame the poor folks coming here if they're being used as political fodder, but they're coming from all over the world to become Democrat, political operatives.
[01:23:21.487 --> 01:23:22.248]  God bless you, Bart.
[01:23:22.708 --> 01:23:24.289]  Let's talk to Michael in Virginia.
[01:23:24.329 --> 01:23:24.850]  You're on the air.
[01:23:27.371 --> 01:23:27.972]  Hello, Alex?
[01:23:28.312 --> 01:23:28.612]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:29.753 --> 01:23:30.454]  Okay, beautiful.
[01:23:30.794 --> 01:23:33.256]  I enjoy your products and I look forward to receiving your products.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:43.025]  Alex, this is a message for all the infiltrators, the FBI, the CIA, the New World Order, Klaus Schwab and his economic forum who are listening right now.
[01:23:43.305 --> 01:23:44.566]  I love you, first of all, Alex.
[01:23:45.006 --> 01:23:48.288]  First of all, we are decentralizing Infowars.
[01:23:48.308 --> 01:23:51.109]  It's decentralizing your power and control.
[01:23:51.510 --> 01:23:55.212]  Alex Jones, you have been chosen by our Lord to be the leader in the front.
[01:23:55.372 --> 01:23:57.253]  You are the member of the body.
[01:23:57.552 --> 01:24:00.832]   You represent the party against the left and the right wing who
[01:24:00.832 --> 01:24:04.712]   are taking us, who are manipulating us in the direction that they have
[01:24:04.712 --> 01:24:07.471]  been using to maintain control.
[01:24:07.471 --> 01:24:10.792]   George Washington warned us against the power of political
[01:24:10.792 --> 01:24:14.032]   parties and replacing our nationality.
[01:24:14.032 --> 01:24:17.271]   You're standing up against those who have been chosen.
[01:24:17.271 --> 01:24:20.313]   The majority of the masses support Infowars.
[01:24:20.313 --> 01:24:24.792]   Obviously, there are those who are against you, but they cannot stand
[01:24:24.792 --> 01:24:26.472]  against the masses of us.
[01:24:26.464 --> 01:24:31.446]  Because we are using the power of our Lord, which is through quantum communication.
[01:24:31.826 --> 01:24:40.528]  Brother, I totally, I don't want you to continue, but what do you make of Klaus Schwab declaring information warfare against us and saying he's going to launch InfoWarriors?
[01:24:40.889 --> 01:24:41.989]  I mean, they are scared.
[01:24:43.035 --> 01:24:43.616]  Yeah, they are.
[01:24:43.916 --> 01:24:46.118]  They are definitely losing the battle.
[01:24:46.158 --> 01:24:47.019]  They realize this.
[01:24:47.379 --> 01:24:49.361]  The purpose for putting bait, they're losing.
[01:24:49.642 --> 01:24:50.442]  They understand that.
[01:24:50.482 --> 01:24:56.649]  They are coming against it, but they can't win as long as we do not put one party against the other.
[01:24:57.089 --> 01:24:57.850]  Forget the left.
[01:24:57.970 --> 01:24:58.591]  Forget the right.
[01:24:58.651 --> 01:25:00.132]  Consider the birds of the air.
[01:25:00.432 --> 01:25:04.957]  Those who are without wings, they're birds without wings, such as ostriches, emus.
[01:25:05.353 --> 01:25:11.332]   and Kiwis, they don't have wings, but the birds soar, but the birds travel the earth,
[01:25:11.332 --> 01:25:13.112]  the population of the people.
[01:25:13.112 --> 01:25:15.592]  You are the representative of our Lord.
[01:25:15.592 --> 01:25:17.032]  Continue the fight.
[01:25:17.032 --> 01:25:19.112]  You are on the victory path.
[01:25:19.112 --> 01:25:25.993]   Now, the graphite, the stuff that they put in the vaccine is used to disconnect our quantum communication,
[01:25:25.993 --> 01:25:29.712]   our electromagnetic frequency to our Lord, just as we communicate with ourselves.
[01:25:29.712 --> 01:25:33.113]  And they know DNA is electrochemical transmitter.
[01:25:33.169 --> 01:25:34.572]  They're trying to block that antenna.
[01:25:34.592 --> 01:25:35.755]  You're absolutely right.
[01:25:36.196 --> 01:25:39.443]  And the fluoride attacks the pineal gland, which is the seat of that.
[01:25:40.447 --> 01:25:41.988]  Yes, you got it, brother.
[01:25:42.249 --> 01:25:43.290]  You keep up the fight.
[01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:52.658]  We are on the verge, but watch out for those callers who call in who represent Klaus Schwab and the infiltrators.
[01:25:52.678 --> 01:25:54.119]  They want you to be violent.
[01:25:54.339 --> 01:25:55.661]  They want you to raise violence.
[01:25:55.681 --> 01:25:56.561]  No, we don't need that.
[01:25:56.902 --> 01:25:58.143]  We do not need that.
[01:25:58.263 --> 01:26:03.168]   All we need is for you to continue to Let the left and the right know they are on point.
[01:26:03.249 --> 01:26:04.630]  Our lawmakers have failed us.
[01:26:04.711 --> 01:26:06.473]  Our congressmen have failed us.
[01:26:06.733 --> 01:26:08.396]  These political parties have failed us.
[01:26:08.436 --> 01:26:08.997]  No, I agree.
[01:26:09.017 --> 01:26:09.758]  I agree, Michael.
[01:26:09.778 --> 01:26:11.480]  One of my biggest failures is making it left-right.
[01:26:11.841 --> 01:26:13.323]  We should be reaching out to these poor leftists.
[01:26:13.343 --> 01:26:13.904]  They're slaves.
[01:26:14.977 --> 01:26:15.777]  They are slaves.
[01:26:15.977 --> 01:26:22.799]  The Republican rhino, those people in the party, the left and the right, they are also in cahoots.
[01:26:22.939 --> 01:26:23.659]  They are tyrants.
[01:26:24.099 --> 01:26:25.260]  They have sold us out.
[01:26:25.520 --> 01:26:26.940]  And we must remember that.
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:32.521]  Our first soldier, George Washington, who represented the Republic, this nation that we stand for.
[01:26:32.841 --> 01:26:34.282]  I'm not concerned about Europe.
[01:26:34.602 --> 01:26:36.042]  I'm concerned about America.
[01:26:36.202 --> 01:26:36.942]  Thank you, Michael.
[01:26:37.002 --> 01:26:38.463]  God, these callers are incredible.
[01:26:38.863 --> 01:26:40.103]  What an incredible show!
[01:26:39.983 --> 01:26:42.983]  I mean these people are amazing!
[01:26:42.983 --> 01:26:44.983]  AHHHHHHHHH!
[01:26:45.983 --> 01:26:49.983]  (Dramatic Music)
[01:26:50.983 --> 01:26:54.342]   The cavalry for your immune system, the cavalry for your health, and the cavalry to keep InfoWars on the air with

[01:27:22.228 --> 01:27:30.454]  And despite the fact it's going to sell out quick, I want those of you that haven't experienced it to get it, and I want long-term supporters to experience it as well.
[01:27:30.754 --> 01:27:34.476]  So it is 50% off out of the gates for a limited time.
[01:27:34.897 --> 01:27:40.381]  DNA Force Plus, finally back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com for 50% off.
[01:27:42.262 --> 01:27:45.164]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship.
[01:27:46.044 --> 01:27:50.346]  Supporting InfoWars defeats the Globalist, and this product does amazing things for your body.
[01:27:50.226 --> 01:28:12.546]  take action now.
[01:28:12.423 --> 01:28:14.423]  [Alarm]
[01:28:14.423 --> 01:28:17.423]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[01:28:17.423 --> 01:28:21.423]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[01:28:21.423 --> 01:28:23.423]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[01:28:23.963 --> 01:28:24.343]  Louis.
[01:28:24.624 --> 01:28:31.669]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days rolling through your neighborhood.
[01:28:31.829 --> 01:28:36.353]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis, do not be alarmed.
[01:28:36.633 --> 01:28:37.654]  Guns will be taken.
[01:28:37.694 --> 01:28:38.875]  No one will ever be armed.
[01:28:38.895 --> 01:28:40.056]  We will take all weapons.
[01:28:40.216 --> 01:28:42.558]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:28:42.598 --> 01:28:46.922]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[01:28:47.162 --> 01:28:47.442]  Enough.
[01:28:49.844 --> 01:28:50.084]  Enough.
[01:28:50.224 --> 01:28:54.727]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[01:28:54.807 --> 01:28:58.890]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[01:28:59.170 --> 01:29:05.334]  NSTSA News 12 Jeff Ferrell discovered that clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem.
[01:29:06.035 --> 01:29:06.195]  Us.
[01:29:06.355 --> 01:29:14.260]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:16.902]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:29:17.956 --> 01:29:19.718]  Somebody else made that happen.
[01:29:20.399 --> 01:29:26.386]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:29:26.666 --> 01:29:31.332]  Blackhawk choppers soaring through the night sky, but this is only a drill.
[01:29:31.452 --> 01:29:36.131]   Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect house to house
[01:29:36.131 --> 01:29:48.971]   It's a joint military training exercise involving local police also military
[01:29:49.416 --> 01:29:50.577]  You're in your apartment!
[01:29:50.737 --> 01:29:51.817]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[01:29:51.837 --> 01:29:52.678]  Go back inside right now!
[01:29:52.858 --> 01:29:53.838]  I am inside.
[01:29:54.118 --> 01:29:55.179]  I have two words for you.
[01:29:55.499 --> 01:29:56.880]  Predator clones.
[01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:58.721]  You will never see it coming.
[01:30:02.873 --> 01:30:05.655]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras.
[01:30:05.755 --> 01:30:14.920]  Parents grabbing their children and running after spending the night hunkering in their houses and then finding themselves face-to-face with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:20.263]  They let them in the area, they told them they could come in, and now they're coming in like they're trespassers, punching and shoving people.
[01:30:20.443 --> 01:30:25.246]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[01:30:25.506 --> 01:30:27.648]  If you want them, come and take them!
[01:30:29.275 --> 01:30:30.497]  We are on the march.
[01:30:31.078 --> 01:30:33.521]  The Empire is on the run.
[01:30:33.662 --> 01:30:38.662]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.

[01:30:59.478 --> 01:31:10.604]  This is the Horror of 1776!
[01:31:10.664 --> 01:31:12.885]  There is another very important phase of warfare.
[01:31:14.266 --> 01:31:19.029]  It has as its target, not the body, but the mind of the enemy.
[01:31:20.336 --> 01:31:24.598]  Target psychological warfare is against the enemy's mind.
[01:31:25.259 --> 01:31:26.519]  It is words and ideas.
[01:31:26.860 --> 01:31:33.860]  ammunition used by Psi-War.
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:39.020]   Its mission is to influence the thoughts of the enemy soldiers.
[01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:43.500]   And at the same time, is expected and encouraged to study foreign languages
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:47.579]   and the social sciences such as history, economics, and sociology.
[01:31:47.579 --> 01:31:49.579]  on their first impression.
[01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:53.034]  He must have a broad and sympathetic understanding of all phases of human experience.
[01:31:56.081 --> 01:32:05.340]   in the walls of night closing but the use of this force as an integral part of combat has
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:22.081]   now taken on new form you say my last goodbye
[01:32:22.081 --> 01:32:32.081]   but the use of this force as an integral part of combat has now taken on new form
[01:32:32.081 --> 01:32:47.351]   you say my last goodbye but the use of this force as an integral part of combat has
[01:32:47.351 --> 01:32:57.520]   now taken on new form Nancy Pelosi's one woman attempt to start the third world
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:59.441]   war It was a scam.
[01:32:59.821 --> 01:33:02.303]  It was a semiconductor pump and dump scheme.
[01:33:02.643 --> 01:33:07.985]  And you didn't care about the effect on the people of Taiwan or the people of the United States.
[01:33:08.305 --> 01:33:09.666]  You cared about your wallet.
[01:33:13.592 --> 01:33:21.877]  And all of this was for her to get a private tour of the NVIDIA chip factory after she purchased millions in shares using insider info.
[01:33:21.917 --> 01:33:22.837]  What are you saying?
[01:33:23.217 --> 01:33:27.340]  Has your husband ever made a stock purchase or sale based on information he received from you?
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:27.700]  No.
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:29.161]  Absolutely not.
[01:33:30.942 --> 01:33:36.926]  What is the driving force behind Nancy Pelosi's just great desire to go to Taiwan?
[01:33:37.186 --> 01:33:42.590]  She went there to show support, American support, for the country and the people of Taiwan.
[01:33:42.650 --> 01:33:47.013]  She didn't take her time out to meet with TSMC officials.
[01:33:47.033 --> 01:33:51.356]  She wouldn't be anywhere near Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers.
[01:33:51.776 --> 01:33:58.241]  Washington posts Pelosi to meet with Taiwan's biggest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC.
[01:33:58.561 --> 01:34:01.303]  Congresswoman AOC actually agrees with me on this.
[01:34:01.543 --> 01:34:14.492]  Legitimate concerns about conflict of interest, a member being able to have access to things like briefings, but also having any sort of stock while you are voting on legislation before the House.
[01:34:14.772 --> 01:34:15.633]  That was nice for me.
[01:34:16.113 --> 01:34:16.353]  Yeah.
[01:34:16.473 --> 01:34:16.953]  Oh, that's good.
[01:34:17.013 --> 01:34:17.673]  It was nice for her.
[01:34:17.693 --> 01:34:18.273]  No, it did not.
[01:34:18.293 --> 01:34:19.094]  Of course he did not.
[01:34:19.114 --> 01:34:21.234]  Well, of course he didn't do any business over there.
[01:34:21.494 --> 01:34:22.014]  Yes, he did.
[01:34:22.374 --> 01:34:24.095]  This is all about semiconductors.
[01:34:24.115 --> 01:34:25.435]  This is about her and her husband.
[01:34:25.515 --> 01:34:27.155]  They were running that pump-and-dump scheme.
[01:34:27.175 --> 01:34:30.916]  I mean, it looks bad because it is bad, Congressman.
[01:34:31.016 --> 01:34:41.238]  How is it possible that the husband of the Speaker of the House, Paul Pelosi, is trading on all of this, buying chip stock to add to the chips bill, then he sells it right before the vote?
[01:34:41.618 --> 01:34:42.538]  What is going on?
[01:34:43.098 --> 01:34:47.843]  The Pelosi's have been pawns of the CCP or the highest bidder for a long time.
[01:34:48.223 --> 01:34:53.208]  When I was a little girl, I was told at the beach if I dug a hole deep enough, we would reach China.
[01:34:53.288 --> 01:34:55.830]  So we've always felt a connection there.
[01:34:56.691 --> 01:35:08.121]   Maybe if all of us start buying the same stocks Pelosi does, it'll become so market moving that even Reporters in America might have to notice the corruption.
[01:35:08.421 --> 01:35:12.524]  Nancy Pelosi makes money off of the things that she legislates?
[01:35:13.685 --> 01:35:15.086]  No!
[01:35:15.527 --> 01:35:18.109]  We're told she's a master legislator.
[01:35:18.209 --> 01:35:20.390]  I thought this was all about standing up to the CCP.
[01:35:21.751 --> 01:35:27.776]  This is what is happening in our government, and Mitch McConnell is not free of connections in China.
[01:35:28.177 --> 01:35:30.819]  These are the people that are in charge.
[01:35:31.319 --> 01:35:33.401]  This is why they don't retire.
[01:35:34.041 --> 01:35:38.265]  This is why their families, their sons, go on trips with them.
[01:35:38.785 --> 01:35:40.367]  This is why they don't go away.
[01:35:40.847 --> 01:35:43.869]  Please try to question my credentials on China.
[01:35:43.690 --> 01:35:50.690]   I invite you to come and ask me who I am to China and to Taiwan.
[01:35:50.690 --> 01:36:06.690]   Well, my old friend, Greg Reese, a great researcher is in studio with us. I...
[01:36:07.275 --> 01:36:08.557]  I saw him yesterday, gave him a hug.
[01:36:08.597 --> 01:36:09.699]  I was busy, he was busy.
[01:36:09.719 --> 01:36:10.861]  We only talked for like a minute.
[01:36:11.722 --> 01:36:14.828]  I didn't know what he was talking about before he got here, and I said, what do you think is front and center?
[01:36:16.023 --> 01:36:19.862]   And I just came back during the break, he said, I think the collapse of the world monetary
[01:36:19.862 --> 01:36:24.502]   system by design, the private federal reserve, and how it's pushing the world into collapse
[01:36:24.502 --> 01:36:25.502]  and war.
[01:36:25.502 --> 01:36:26.502]  I think you're dead on.
[01:36:26.502 --> 01:36:27.782]  That's really the central issue.
[01:36:27.782 --> 01:36:32.502]   All the lockdowns, all the police state, all the social credit scores, all that is them
[01:36:32.502 --> 01:36:35.262]  trying to manage the end of their Ponzi scheme.
[01:36:35.262 --> 01:36:36.262]  Absolutely.
[01:36:36.262 --> 01:36:40.221]   And, you know, I'm listening to a lot of financial pundits lately, and some of the most exciting
[01:36:40.221 --> 01:36:45.983]   things I'm hearing is people are talking, already talking about replacing the Fed, replacing
[01:36:45.983 --> 01:36:46.983]  the central bank.
[01:36:46.983 --> 01:36:50.382]   Yeah, not just Tucker Carlson, but mainline analysts are saying the Federal Reserve is
[01:36:50.890 --> 01:36:51.530]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:36:51.751 --> 01:37:00.716]  I think everyone in the world is starting to wake up to that fact right now, that the Federal Reserve fiat currency system is what's responsible for all the problems in the world right now.
[01:37:01.336 --> 01:37:11.263]  And people are talking about silver and gold mines going into private business as banks, since they have the vaults already, and they tie a crypto card to gold and silver.
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:21.745]  And then the private market, the free private market can just compete for people's trust and serviceability and start creating a parallel banking system.
[01:37:21.785 --> 01:37:24.907]  So the end of their systems here, they're trying to rope us in.
[01:37:24.967 --> 01:37:27.308]  Instead of them going to prison, they get more power.
[01:37:27.749 --> 01:37:40.156]  What they want is they want to toss us an idea of some type of digital fiat currency as if, I mean, only a fool is going to accept anything that they take after all of the death and destruction that they've caused for decades and decades.
[01:37:40.836 --> 01:37:41.976]  But that's obviously the plan.
[01:37:42.337 --> 01:37:43.337]  And I don't see that happening.
[01:37:43.797 --> 01:37:48.039]  I don't think people are just going to be waiting for them to come up with a solution.
[01:37:48.759 --> 01:37:49.719]  Especially... Well, exactly.
[01:37:49.739 --> 01:37:53.341]  They're not getting away with collapsing things and acting like they're the savior.
[01:37:53.501 --> 01:37:53.881]  Not at all.
[01:37:54.041 --> 01:37:56.582]  It's all about, can they play the savior or can they play the bad guy?
[01:37:56.602 --> 01:37:57.422]  Because they are the bad guy.
[01:37:57.722 --> 01:37:59.923]  And if we cast them as the bad guy, it's game over.
[01:38:00.143 --> 01:38:00.643]  Absolutely.
[01:38:01.044 --> 01:38:03.245]  And I think the majority of the world sees him as the bad guy now.
[01:38:03.605 --> 01:38:13.212]  With BRICS going to gold and silver now, that's the majority of the world population now becoming enlightened to the value of gold and silver-backed currency.
[01:38:13.312 --> 01:38:17.555]  So I don't see any way the Federal Reserve is going to be able to pull fiat out.
[01:38:17.575 --> 01:38:22.138]  So Greg, look right in that camera and tell them, do you think Team Freedom or Team Demon is winning right now?
[01:38:22.538 --> 01:38:23.940]  I think Team Freedom is winning right now.
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:29.926]  If you were to ask me a few months ago, I would have said differently, but I've had a paradigm shift of optimism.
[01:38:29.966 --> 01:38:31.007]  I think Team Freedom is winning 100%.
[01:38:31.407 --> 01:38:32.428]  I agree.
[01:38:32.808 --> 01:38:34.090]  But that's why we're in so much danger.
[01:38:34.110 --> 01:38:35.551]  They're going to throw the kitchen sink at us now.
[01:38:35.871 --> 01:38:37.353]  And what does the kitchen sink represent?
[01:38:37.713 --> 01:38:38.534]  Power outages?
[01:38:38.975 --> 01:38:40.436]  Cyberattacks by the Russians?
[01:38:40.496 --> 01:38:41.897]  I mean, Katie, bar the door.
[01:38:41.958 --> 01:38:42.258]  It's on.
[01:38:42.438 --> 01:38:43.199]  Whatever they can do.
[01:38:43.219 --> 01:38:56.928]  I think this is now, this explains why they're pushing for nuclear warfare, why they're poking us constantly trying to get us to just go out and start a war with each other because that seems to be their only option at this point is to create mass chaos.
[01:38:57.208 --> 01:38:57.548]  That's right.
[01:38:57.588 --> 01:38:59.770]  They're not doing this out of strength, but desperateness.
[01:39:00.150 --> 01:39:01.010]  Completely desperate.
[01:39:01.451 --> 01:39:02.692]  And I just don't see it winning.
[01:39:02.712 --> 01:39:20.125]   Like in the past, you know, most of the wars that we started were because of the Federal Reserve Bank, you know, trying to prop up our currency and we can't do that anymore because I don't see the United States Having any hope of defeating China and Russia, so they just want absolute chaos and like you said the Phoenix out of the ashes.
[01:39:21.346 --> 01:39:23.608]  But I don't see it happening because there's too many people waking up.
[01:39:23.968 --> 01:39:29.293]  There's too many people already starting to build a parallel economy or at least talk about it.
[01:39:29.773 --> 01:39:33.076]  No one's talking about a fiat crypto digital.
[01:39:33.417 --> 01:39:39.302]  So gut level, what can we do to lessen the chaos we're entering?
[01:39:40.404 --> 01:39:48.326]  Well, I think the smartest thing we could do is actually start coming together and creating a parallel economy now, which I think can be done.
[01:39:48.346 --> 01:39:51.948]  Like people were talking about the gold and silver miners getting involved.
[01:39:52.168 --> 01:40:01.091]  Because the more we start becoming proactive about our money, we could actually participate in the destruction of the Federal Reserve.
[01:40:01.111 --> 01:40:01.651]  I agree.
[01:40:01.871 --> 01:40:06.132]  We should monetarily create new systems, but also, like Ronnie Howard Brown says, grow gardens.
[01:40:06.292 --> 01:40:08.613]  Basic stuff, like getting back to being human.
[01:40:09.213 --> 01:40:11.117]  Absolutely, that's another, exactly.
[01:40:11.137 --> 01:40:13.502]  If we start growing gardens, then we don't need them.
[01:40:13.522 --> 01:40:16.307]  I mean, five chickens in your backyard, they'll eat all the bugs.
[01:40:16.708 --> 01:40:18.872]  You're going to get six, seven, eight eggs a day out of that.
[01:40:19.072 --> 01:40:19.894]  You could live off that.
[01:40:21.021 --> 01:40:22.683]  I was hearing an interview from a guy from St.
[01:40:22.723 --> 01:40:30.571]  Petersburg, Russia recently, and he was talking about on the weekends there, nobody goes out to restaurants or bars on the weekends, everyone just goes home and tends their garden.
[01:40:30.952 --> 01:40:35.336]  Which makes sense, because a hundred years ago, millions of people were starved to death over there, so it's still in there.
[01:40:35.356 --> 01:40:39.181]  And the Russians have an ancestral memory of 23 million killed by Hitler.
[01:40:39.341 --> 01:40:39.561]  Right.
[01:40:39.961 --> 01:40:40.442]  Exactly.
[01:40:40.822 --> 01:40:42.905]  That's why they're strong, is they've been through hell.
[01:40:43.385 --> 01:40:53.331]  And if we let them take us to hell, like they're trying to do, then eventually, maybe a hundred years from now, we'll all be growing our own gardens now, but the smart thing would be to get ahead of it and just start doing it now.
[01:40:53.411 --> 01:40:54.851]  Just start cutting them out of the picture.
[01:40:55.332 --> 01:40:56.272]  We don't need them anymore.
[01:40:56.372 --> 01:40:59.914]  We're smart enough and we're innovative enough where we can govern ourselves, basically.
[01:40:59.954 --> 01:41:06.358]  Now, you believe we need leadership and we need some form of government, but we can just start taking care of that instead of waiting for the end.
[01:41:06.378 --> 01:41:08.939]  Well, I mean, I do believe in just limited government.
[01:41:08.979 --> 01:41:11.280]  When the government's at war with you, it's not a government, it's an enemy.
[01:41:12.995 --> 01:41:13.575]  A hundred percent.
[01:41:14.236 --> 01:41:19.739]  And right now, I think more than ever, I've seen just the average person starting to wake up to this.
[01:41:19.759 --> 01:41:25.163]  I think the average people are actually starting to talk about the Declaration of Independence and the revolution.
[01:41:25.183 --> 01:41:25.963]  Well, exactly.
[01:41:25.983 --> 01:41:27.964]  So they can try to target the leaders of the resistance.
[01:41:28.004 --> 01:41:28.625]  They've already failed.
[01:41:29.045 --> 01:41:29.565]  A hundred percent.
[01:41:29.605 --> 01:41:32.526]  And the more they target the leaders, the more they're going to create more leaders.
[01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:34.486]  It's just going to inspire more people to get up and fight.
[01:41:34.526 --> 01:41:40.827]  Because right now, I'm starting to see the fighting spirit come back into this sleeping zombie of America.
[01:41:40.847 --> 01:41:42.067]  I'm really starting to see that more.
[01:41:42.528 --> 01:41:46.848]  It started for me a lot with Steve Bannon at CPAC with that fiery speech about the Fed.
[01:41:47.368 --> 01:41:50.309]  And the crowd was almost reluctant at first, but then it grew in excitement.
[01:41:50.329 --> 01:41:52.750]  I really respect Steve Bannon.
[01:41:53.390 --> 01:41:55.030]  He's really grown into a major leader.
[01:41:55.550 --> 01:41:56.911]  And now people are willing to hear it.
[01:41:56.971 --> 01:41:58.452]  You know, now people are starting to talk about it.
[01:41:58.492 --> 01:42:03.876]  And the IRS, what they're doing with the IRS, with the 86,000 agents, that's just helped our cause.
[01:42:03.896 --> 01:42:06.498]  Because now people are starting to talk about, why do we even need the IRS?
[01:42:06.539 --> 01:42:09.000]  And how is that not the most un-American thing that we've ever had?
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:11.042]  You know, taxing a third of our income.
[01:42:11.262 --> 01:42:15.806]  When we had a Revolutionary War that was based on just jacking the price of tea up, you know, it's unbelievable.
[01:42:17.447 --> 01:42:23.491]  Well, Greg Reese is our guest here in studio on this live Friday broadcast.
[01:42:23.511 --> 01:42:26.694]   So Greg, Everybody knows they're at a crossroads.
[01:42:27.234 --> 01:42:28.555]  A test is happening on this planet.
[01:42:28.935 --> 01:42:29.916]  What is that test?
[01:42:29.936 --> 01:42:32.157]  Spiritually, big picture, you're a smart guy.
[01:42:32.177 --> 01:42:33.197]  I really respect your opinion.
[01:42:33.698 --> 01:42:35.018]  We play your reports every week.
[01:42:35.058 --> 01:42:35.679]  People love you.
[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:38.500]  Why are you optimistic?
[01:42:38.580 --> 01:42:39.961]  Where do you think we are historically?
[01:42:40.882 --> 01:42:42.002]  I think the test is clear.
[01:42:42.022 --> 01:42:43.423]  I think we're being offered.
[01:42:43.903 --> 01:42:44.784]  It's offering acceptance.
[01:42:44.864 --> 01:42:46.365]  And they've been doing this for years.
[01:42:46.405 --> 01:42:48.206]  They're offering us slavery.
[01:42:48.626 --> 01:42:57.006]   They've actually started to offer us slavery Years ago, I think they started to make us that offer right after the Revolutionary War to try to rope us back into it.
[01:42:57.606 --> 01:42:59.528]  And ultimately, it's our choice.
[01:42:59.688 --> 01:43:01.829]  Ultimately, we don't have to be slaves.
[01:43:01.869 --> 01:43:12.337]  We could actually become independent, become responsible citizens of this country, and really start participating, which we haven't seen in generations.
[01:43:12.457 --> 01:43:14.178]  That's what I believe is being offered.
[01:43:15.019 --> 01:43:32.475]   And your show on Wednesday, I thought, was One of the clearest, most powerful broadcasts I've seen on your show in a while when you were calling out that we have to hold Trump's feet to the fire and the line in the sand has to be the vaccine.
[01:43:32.695 --> 01:43:33.636]  It has to be because...
[01:43:35.049 --> 01:43:39.392]  Once we start going against Big Pharma and what they've done, it all comes unraveled.
[01:43:39.452 --> 01:43:44.515]  Because the crimes that have been committed in the past two years is the crime of the century, at least.
[01:43:44.775 --> 01:43:48.417]  And so once we go there, everything is exposed.
[01:43:48.537 --> 01:43:50.939]  And there's no way out except all the way through to freedom.
[01:43:51.559 --> 01:43:52.400]  That's the test, I think.
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:53.260]  I agree.
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:53.740]  Continue.
[01:43:55.121 --> 01:43:56.402]  And so we just have to continue.
[01:43:56.442 --> 01:44:05.614]   And the reason I believe that we're going to win is because you can see that the way they've had this thing all planned, they had it They weren't expecting this much pushback.
[01:44:05.634 --> 01:44:07.736]  They weren't expecting this much defiance.
[01:44:07.756 --> 01:44:16.043]  They were definitely expecting more people to take the vaccine, which tells me that... Oh, Klaus Schwab comes out and says, today we've hired 110,000 info warriors.
[01:44:16.063 --> 01:44:16.843]  They use our term.
[01:44:16.883 --> 01:44:17.044]  Right.
[01:44:17.324 --> 01:44:18.485]  To counter the disinfo.
[01:44:18.745 --> 01:44:18.925]  Right.
[01:44:19.326 --> 01:44:19.506]  Right.
[01:44:20.652 --> 01:44:21.972]  I mean, they're desperate.
[01:44:21.992 --> 01:44:23.013]  They're calling us criminals.
[01:44:23.033 --> 01:44:24.973]  They're calling anyone who goes against the vaccine criminals.
[01:44:24.993 --> 01:44:32.675]  So they, I think they clearly expected, they didn't realize how awake we were and neither did I. I actually, well, it's a two, it goes both ways.
[01:44:32.695 --> 01:44:36.455]  When 2020 first happened, I was like, wow, I didn't realize how dumb and asleep we are.
[01:44:36.515 --> 01:44:43.137]  But as the couple of years have gone by, I've seen a massive awakening and I'm starting to really have a lot of hope for this.
[01:44:44.017 --> 01:44:49.942]  The other thing I also realize, if you were to tell me three or four years ago that we need leadership, I might have argued that.
[01:44:50.382 --> 01:45:01.571]  But after seeing COVID and realizing that a large amount of the population is sheep-like, out of respect and love for our fellow man, we do need leadership.
[01:45:01.591 --> 01:45:02.091]  Well, that's right.
[01:45:02.451 --> 01:45:04.333]  As leaders, we don't want to lead people.
[01:45:04.413 --> 01:45:10.800]   We want them to be leaders, but if they're going to be under the control of evil people, Not control them, but lead by example.
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:11.700]  Be the good shepherd.
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:13.181]  That's where we have to be.
[01:45:13.801 --> 01:45:15.682]  And we have an opportunity here.
[01:45:15.722 --> 01:45:18.203]  We've been given this beautiful earth, this beautiful garden.
[01:45:18.223 --> 01:45:25.406]  You know, they're trying to sell us bugs, which has got the chitin, which is in my upcoming report, and trying to take beef away and everything.
[01:45:25.766 --> 01:45:26.707]  But we already know.
[01:45:26.967 --> 01:45:30.528]  Which they admit, the bug exoskeleton is pure poison.
[01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:31.689]  Yeah.
[01:45:32.169 --> 01:45:34.270]  We revolt from bugs because we're not supposed to eat them.
[01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:35.651]  Our brain knows, don't eat that.
[01:45:36.411 --> 01:45:46.874]  And we're not so far gone that we have forgotten that beef is actually one of the most nutritious, I mean it's the sacred cow, it's a life-sustaining source.
[01:45:46.934 --> 01:45:47.694]  It's the perfect meat.
[01:45:47.875 --> 01:45:51.356]  Yeah, and everything that's alive is only alive because it's consumed.
[01:45:51.416 --> 01:45:54.477]  And a cow eats grass and it's self-fulfilling, it feeds you beef.
[01:45:55.017 --> 01:45:57.177]  The Bible, Genesis starts talking about beef.
[01:45:57.417 --> 01:45:57.638]  Yeah.
[01:45:57.838 --> 01:45:58.498]  I mean it's like...
[01:45:59.218 --> 01:45:59.438]  Yeah.
[01:45:59.939 --> 01:46:00.860]  We've already been given this.
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:02.361]  It grows our brains generationally.
[01:46:02.401 --> 01:46:03.082]  It makes us better.
[01:46:03.222 --> 01:46:03.402]  Yeah.
[01:46:03.623 --> 01:46:07.106]  It's literally a natural growth hormone for our brains.
[01:46:07.527 --> 01:46:08.347]  It makes us smarter.
[01:46:09.048 --> 01:46:10.510]  It makes our bodies function better.
[01:46:11.110 --> 01:46:15.175]  We live in this ecosystem that we've yet to master.
[01:46:15.215 --> 01:46:20.100]  We have yet to master how to be completely symbiotic and in balance with nature.
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:24.043]  Now let's be clear about the Israelites leaving Egypt.
[01:46:24.484 --> 01:46:26.706]  They weren't supposed to worship the golden calf.
[01:46:26.746 --> 01:46:27.726]  God already gave them that.
[01:46:27.787 --> 01:46:28.547]  Worship God.
[01:46:28.888 --> 01:46:30.569]  But the calf is key.
[01:46:30.969 --> 01:46:31.170]  Yeah.
[01:46:31.690 --> 01:46:31.890]  Yes.
[01:46:32.271 --> 01:46:34.913]  We don't worship it, but sure as hell we need it.
[01:46:35.033 --> 01:46:35.233]  Yes.
[01:46:35.514 --> 01:46:36.054]  Absolutely.
[01:46:36.414 --> 01:46:38.796]  Because they've proven generation to generation it grows the brain.
[01:46:39.017 --> 01:46:39.157]  Yeah.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:52.144]  And, you know, I'm doing the report on that now, and one of the interesting things, there's a myth of, like, vegetarianism is sort of connected to yoga, and there's a bunch of, you know, yoga's so popular, and there's all these vegans into that.
[01:46:52.504 --> 01:46:56.246]  But that's a whole myth, because if you actually look at that, that was based on the caste system.
[01:46:56.566 --> 01:46:58.807]  Vegetarians were just the lower castes.
[01:46:59.207 --> 01:47:07.130]  The warrior class and the priest class were given meat, and the only reason the lower castes were given vegetarian meals was so that they could save the meat for the upper class.
[01:47:07.150 --> 01:47:08.450]  Exactly, that's in the Vedic scriptures.
[01:47:08.751 --> 01:47:09.953]  And that's all they're trying to do now.
[01:47:09.993 --> 01:47:16.709]  They're just trying to create this new caste system where we're all these lower peasants eating bugs and then they can fly around in jets and have all the good stuff, you know?
[01:47:17.418 --> 01:47:20.719]  More than that, I think they just want to get us off the land because they see minerals.
[01:47:20.779 --> 01:47:21.419]  I mean, that's it.
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:26.141]  Cows are the main thing sustaining farms, whether it's the Netherlands or New Zealand or the U.S.
[01:47:26.161 --> 01:47:27.442]  You get rid of those, we all collapse.
[01:47:27.482 --> 01:47:27.662]  Yeah.
[01:47:28.062 --> 01:47:33.584]  I mean, cows actually take CO2 out of the air, and CO2 is a good thing.
[01:47:33.984 --> 01:47:41.547]  But there's a story that just came out called Eat Beef, Save the Planet, and it shows how if you take all the cows out, the grass are going to create actually more methane and CO2.
[01:47:41.587 --> 01:47:42.947]  And there's always been wild cows.
[01:47:43.247 --> 01:47:43.327]  Yeah.
[01:47:43.347 --> 01:47:46.549]   That's what the buffalo... A buffalo can mate with a Hershire.
[01:47:46.589 --> 01:47:47.892]  It can mate with a jersey.
[01:47:47.972 --> 01:47:48.613]  It's a cow.
[01:47:49.034 --> 01:47:50.897]  It can mate with an African water buffalo.
[01:47:53.282 --> 01:47:55.045]  Cows have always been here eating grass.
[01:47:56.545 --> 01:47:59.447]  And the problem is just, really the problem is just factory farming.
[01:47:59.487 --> 01:48:03.409]  And factory farming has gotten a bit horrific and that's what's convinced a lot of people emotionally.
[01:48:03.429 --> 01:48:04.090]  I'm totally against that.
[01:48:04.110 --> 01:48:04.630]  I don't think we can.
[01:48:05.231 --> 01:48:12.155]  Well, what would save the planet more would be to have more cattle farms, local cattle farms all over the place, so you have your own local butcher you could go to.
[01:48:12.175 --> 01:48:13.015]  Well, that's a big lie.
[01:48:13.055 --> 01:48:19.920]  This prime beef thing, where they're on stalls being fed grain and massaged, that's not even healthy meat.
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:20.320]  No.
[01:48:21.501 --> 01:48:22.601]  90% of beef is not from that.
[01:48:22.882 --> 01:48:22.982]  No.
[01:48:23.682 --> 01:48:26.403]  But I don't even want to control that because they'll try to control everybody else, but yeah.
[01:48:27.524 --> 01:48:29.264]  But they're obsessed with cows, folks, for a reason.
[01:48:29.524 --> 01:48:29.744]  Yeah.
[01:48:30.285 --> 01:48:37.508]  You know, the Vedas, like you said, is one of the oldest written histories that exists, and the sacred cow is sacred for a reason.
[01:48:37.528 --> 01:48:45.471]  They would take every part of that cow for sustaining life, and they would, in return, show it a lot of love and respect and consider it to be sacred.
[01:48:46.391 --> 01:48:47.692]  Because that's what's giving us life.
[01:48:47.752 --> 01:48:51.455]  Because people, if you're a lot... You'll notice everything powerful they're trying to take.
[01:48:51.796 --> 01:48:52.116]  Everything.
[01:48:52.136 --> 01:48:53.577]  Mothers, fathers, cows.
[01:48:53.677 --> 01:48:55.218]  I mean... Everything that... Make jokes, folks.
[01:48:55.258 --> 01:48:56.219]  Cows brought us where we're at.
[01:48:56.259 --> 01:48:57.140]  Like, cows did it.
[01:48:57.460 --> 01:48:58.962]  They're selling us death, is what they're doing.
[01:48:58.982 --> 01:49:03.786]  They're basically selling us a life of total misery, sickness, and death.
[01:49:04.346 --> 01:49:04.826]  And you're right.
[01:49:05.067 --> 01:49:10.351]  Everything that's healthy and good, they're taking that away and telling us it's racist and bad.
[01:49:10.531 --> 01:49:11.252]  It's unbelievable.
[01:49:11.272 --> 01:49:12.633]  But they're losing.
[01:49:12.873 --> 01:49:14.594]  And right now, they're just getting more and more desperate.
[01:49:14.614 --> 01:49:16.576]  And like you said, it's going to become more and more dangerous.
[01:49:17.116 --> 01:49:28.425]  And now, more than ever, we have to just continue on and push through and have no fear and win this because it's going to just start accelerating quicker and quicker and quicker.
[01:49:29.005 --> 01:49:30.746]  And any anthropologist knows this.
[01:49:30.866 --> 01:49:32.407]  It's in human evolution studies.
[01:49:32.427 --> 01:49:34.148]  If you don't believe in evolution, they know it.
[01:49:34.748 --> 01:49:38.990]  The eating of bovine is directly connected to our brains getting bigger and our health.
[01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.570]  Absolutely.
[01:49:39.590 --> 01:49:40.971]  And we're designed to eat cows.
[01:49:41.231 --> 01:49:41.632]  Absolutely.
[01:49:42.352 --> 01:49:43.172]  And drink their milk.
[01:49:43.332 --> 01:49:43.532]  Yes.
[01:49:43.753 --> 01:49:44.633]  And the cooked meat, actually.
[01:49:44.653 --> 01:49:55.359]  Cooked meat and meat together allowed us to eat more meat, which allowed us to, like they did a research on how much meat would a monkey, how much raw meat would like a gorilla have to eat to have the brain power that we have.
[01:49:55.399 --> 01:50:00.810]   And it's almost impossible because the You can't consume that much raw meat.
[01:50:00.830 --> 01:50:03.711]  We are a meat-eating homosapien.
[01:50:04.111 --> 01:50:03.711]  100%.
[01:50:04.131 --> 01:50:04.951]  We have the teeth for it.
[01:50:04.971 --> 01:50:09.513]  We have the trypsin enzyme in our body that allows us to digest meat.
[01:50:09.873 --> 01:50:10.773]  We're not supposed to eat bugs.
[01:50:10.993 --> 01:50:12.574]  We're not supposed to eat bugs.
[01:50:12.874 --> 01:50:18.576]  And no one, I mean, yeah, you might find bugs in like certain countries, but no one prefers to eat bugs, you know?
[01:50:18.936 --> 01:50:20.817]  You might have a poor, like in the Philippines or Vietnam.
[01:50:20.857 --> 01:50:27.560]  We're supposed to eat fish and beef and a little bit of poultry and then vegetables and fruit.
[01:50:28.587 --> 01:50:31.613]  Live from the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas.
[01:50:35.841 --> 01:50:39.989]  And Greg Reese and Jade Iyer is coming up and I'm going to go to your phone calls coming up.
[01:50:41.144 --> 01:50:50.091]  Terry and Truman and George and Kevin and Larry and Manuel and T and Ruben and Tucker's up next and Yanny, your calls are all coming up today!
[01:50:50.111 --> 01:50:53.954]  Because they hate you having a place to communicate with millions of people listening.
[01:50:54.054 --> 01:50:55.696]  It is incredible what's happening.
[01:50:55.776 --> 01:50:57.157]  Okay, I'm going to ask a lot of questions.
[01:50:57.177 --> 01:51:01.260]  I've got a lot of points to go through, but Gregg Reese, everybody loves the work you do at Bandai Video.
[01:51:02.621 --> 01:51:03.462]  You have a home here.
[01:51:03.502 --> 01:51:05.723]  You have a place here because the listeners want to thank them.
[01:51:06.244 --> 01:51:07.385]  What else is on your radar screen?
[01:51:10.176 --> 01:51:18.345]  I'm doing a 25th anniversary report for Princess Diana, just because that's coming up in a couple of weeks, the end of the month.
[01:51:19.507 --> 01:51:25.073]  I'm trying to put together a report on the Federal Reserve, more of a proactive approach to it.
[01:51:26.114 --> 01:51:34.321]   But mostly, other than that, I'm basically picking my reports Off the, you know, day by day, just trying to find whatever's most important.
[01:51:34.341 --> 01:52:01.416]   Yeah, just trying to tune into the universe and see what the most important thing is, because our job right here, I believe, is to push the most important subjects, to wake people up, talk about what they don't want us to talk about, and allow our incredible audience, because we're all one big, massive Before I started working here, I was an audience member, and I love to support the InfoWar through the products and everything, but the callers lately have been astounding and everything, and that's what they want to stop.
[01:52:01.456 --> 01:52:03.937]  They want to stop this massive populist resurgence.
[01:52:03.957 --> 01:52:04.498]  This community.
[01:52:04.538 --> 01:52:04.978]  Exactly.
[01:52:05.318 --> 01:52:09.580]  Because we're on air, especially with all these callers we've been getting lately, I've been listening to.
[01:52:10.181 --> 01:52:15.344]  We're out here figuring out solutions, figuring out how we're going to beat this, and that's the last thing they want.
[01:52:15.384 --> 01:52:19.606]  They want us to just... What is it like for you to hear it's all controlled and all manipulated, and you've been here?
[01:52:20.699 --> 01:52:21.540]  And what is InfoWars?
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:22.320]  If you had to describe it.
[01:52:23.340 --> 01:52:25.421]  You know, I was just telling one of the crew members about this.
[01:52:25.461 --> 01:52:27.642]  Like, I wish people could see what this place is actually like.
[01:52:27.662 --> 01:52:30.324]  You know, when I first came here, you know, four years ago...
[01:52:31.437 --> 01:52:40.783]  I'm a very open-minded, very skeptical, suspicious person, and I've heard all the common stories about, you know, controlled opposition and everything, so who knows?
[01:52:40.823 --> 01:52:51.150]  But what I got here, I was just basically told to try to pick a story that I think is important and do my best to get it right and stick to the truth, and that was it.
[01:52:51.490 --> 01:52:56.854]  And I remember asking Rob when he told me that, I was like, shouldn't I show it to anyone first to make sure that it's approved?
[01:52:56.914 --> 01:53:01.157]  And he just looked at me almost with disgust and said, we don't have time for that.
[01:53:01.377 --> 01:53:02.278]  You know, and that's true.
[01:53:02.418 --> 01:53:04.539]  Everyone out here, we're working constantly.
[01:53:04.559 --> 01:53:07.240]  But let's be clear, we saw your work, we chose you because we believe in you.
[01:53:07.781 --> 01:53:08.561]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:53:08.581 --> 01:53:13.063]  It's like the military, like, special forces, go attack the enemy, we're not gonna... 100%.
[01:53:13.344 --> 01:53:19.047]  But in a certain way, I do think there's a certain amount of divine intervention that's happening here.
[01:53:19.087 --> 01:53:34.417]   It's the only way to explain it, because like I said, it's a very busy environment, everyone is busy doing their own thing, and everything just happens to flow like one You know, big machine and it's really unlike anything I've ever been a part of.
[01:53:36.398 --> 01:53:39.959]  Because the directive is we trust you, we want you to tell the truth.
[01:53:40.459 --> 01:53:41.139]  You've done a great job.
[01:53:41.319 --> 01:53:41.599]  Thank you.
[01:53:41.919 --> 01:53:42.560]  I appreciate that.
[01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:43.680]  That's what God wants.
[01:53:44.420 --> 01:53:53.503]  I believe that this is the most divine inspired job I've ever had in my life.
[01:53:53.643 --> 01:54:08.039]   I've never felt So purposeful in my life and it's interesting because the majority of my life I was very aware that I was lacking a sense of purpose and for the past four years I feel like I've been doing God's work and it's been extremely humbling.
[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:12.881]  We believe in humanity so we believe you believe in humanity.
[01:54:12.961 --> 01:54:14.722]  We're fighting for our survival.
[01:54:15.342 --> 01:54:17.143]  We think anybody should just join us.
[01:54:17.343 --> 01:54:17.543]  Yes.
[01:54:17.883 --> 01:54:18.984]  Why would you not join us?
[01:54:19.124 --> 01:54:19.304]  Right.
[01:54:20.290 --> 01:54:21.710]  All we're trying to get to is the truth here.
[01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:22.711]  That's all we're trying to get to.
[01:54:23.011 --> 01:54:25.351]  And it's interesting that now that's what they're attacking.
[01:54:25.391 --> 01:54:30.013]  Now that everyone's starting to wake up, they're attacking this idea of questioning things.
[01:54:30.493 --> 01:54:32.513]  Just trust what we tell you.
[01:54:32.653 --> 01:54:35.594]  Because it's very dangerous if you try questioning anything that we're doing.
[01:54:35.614 --> 01:54:38.515]  And that's just waking more people up because that's just crazy talk.
[01:54:38.535 --> 01:54:43.737]  I mean, they're basically saying, trust authority and be a slave and don't question anything.
[01:54:44.077 --> 01:54:45.917]  And that's all we're doing here.
[01:54:46.097 --> 01:54:48.438]  And these days, my goodness, it's just...
[01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:54.077]  You need divine intervention to pick a story, because, I mean, pick a story!
[01:54:54.137 --> 01:54:57.863]  I mean, what's the amount of madness that's happening in the world today?
[01:54:59.198 --> 01:55:02.259]  It's a... What do you make of the Sam Harris video?
[01:55:02.279 --> 01:55:03.459]  We played it in the second hour.
[01:55:04.020 --> 01:55:05.880]  Just saying, yeah, we lie to you for your own good.
[01:55:06.601 --> 01:55:07.821]  And the arrogance of that, man.
[01:55:07.841 --> 01:55:11.542]  You can just see he has that same spirit Stelter has.
[01:55:12.303 --> 01:55:15.224]  I think it's a great thing, because it's just going to propel this awakening more.
[01:55:15.284 --> 01:55:22.526]  Now we can... I mean, a lot of us already understood that's what the whole atheism movement was about, but now we know clearly.
[01:55:22.566 --> 01:55:30.749]   The atheists are now coming out and saying, we don't care about, you know, Sacrificing children or doing business with China.
[01:55:30.769 --> 01:55:31.670]  We don't care about any of that.
[01:55:31.730 --> 01:55:34.771]  All we care about is keeping God out of government.
[01:55:34.791 --> 01:55:41.474]  Like, Sam Harris is more concerned about having God in our lives than dead children in a basement.
[01:55:41.494 --> 01:55:42.615]  Because he wants to be God.
[01:55:43.075 --> 01:55:43.315]  Yeah.
[01:55:43.896 --> 01:55:45.456]  And that's... You're not God, Sam Harris.
[01:55:45.877 --> 01:55:46.757]  No, none of us are.
[01:55:47.057 --> 01:55:59.005]   And this whole atheism godless movement is directly tied into this anti-human destructive This whole thing, I mean... You look at Harris or Harari, these are pathetic people.
[01:55:59.526 --> 01:56:00.887]  Like, dude, you ain't no God.
[01:56:01.728 --> 01:56:02.089]  All of them.
[01:56:02.669 --> 01:56:04.351]  And they're probably the best ones they got.
[01:56:04.371 --> 01:56:05.953]  They're their young generation, you know.
[01:56:06.013 --> 01:56:09.937]  The rest of them are a bunch of decrepit, aging old zombies.
[01:56:09.957 --> 01:56:10.457]  Pedophiles.
[01:56:10.617 --> 01:56:10.938]  Yeah.
[01:56:11.779 --> 01:56:12.920]  Inbred from years of...
[01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:15.760]  Of madness.
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:19.982]  I mean, really, they're really probably worse off than the rest of us, all these people.
[01:56:20.202 --> 01:56:21.362]  And you can see it in them.
[01:56:21.382 --> 01:56:26.064]  You can see the lifelessness in them, and you can see... It's almost just like... Well, that's why I choose God.
[01:56:26.464 --> 01:56:30.046]  The life in people that love God is incredible!
[01:56:30.126 --> 01:56:31.986]  I mean, how could you deny this?
[01:56:32.346 --> 01:56:33.307]  I would even say that's God.
[01:56:33.447 --> 01:56:38.069]  I would say when a person is in touch with God, then God will play that person like... Oh, it radiates.
[01:56:38.289 --> 01:56:38.709]  Exactly.
[01:56:39.449 --> 01:56:41.050]  And so that's what we see in each other's eyes.
[01:56:41.070 --> 01:56:43.431]  That's what we see in our brothers and our sisters.
[01:56:43.971 --> 01:56:48.853]  And the more we can tune into that, the more we're bringing God into our world through us.
[01:56:49.093 --> 01:56:50.154]  And I'll say this.
[01:56:50.874 --> 01:56:54.075]  There are white people, brown people, black people doing murders and criminal activity.
[01:56:54.436 --> 01:56:57.317]  And I see statistically black people possessed doing bad things.
[01:56:57.997 --> 01:57:02.339]  I don't blame all black people because I've seen such beauty in black people and God in their eyes.
[01:57:02.519 --> 01:57:05.000]  And I know they know we're all doing bad things.
[01:57:05.060 --> 01:57:08.562]  I'm not going to blame what color somebody is, but I'm going to call out the bad behavior.
[01:57:09.002 --> 01:57:12.024]  And that's the beauty of God, is that with God, anyone can turn around.
[01:57:12.084 --> 01:57:19.787]  With God, you could be a murderer in a low life and still find forgiveness, and still find repentance, and still turn your life around.
[01:57:19.827 --> 01:57:20.668]  That's the beauty of it.
[01:57:20.968 --> 01:57:21.808]  Even Sam Harris.
[01:57:22.088 --> 01:57:23.929]  Sam Harris can turn his life around.
[01:57:23.949 --> 01:57:25.050]  Can you imagine if he did?
[01:57:25.210 --> 01:57:26.230]  Well, you look at him, though.
[01:57:26.751 --> 01:57:29.152]  The smug look on his face is pathetic.
[01:57:29.472 --> 01:57:30.052]  Unbelievable.
[01:57:30.132 --> 01:57:31.413]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:57:31.713 --> 01:57:35.475]  And then compared to the... He's staring into eternity acting like he's in charge.
[01:57:35.515 --> 01:57:35.715]  Yeah.
[01:57:35.876 --> 01:57:37.136]  It's like that Gnarls Barkley song.
[01:57:37.417 --> 01:57:38.397]  You think you're in charge?
[01:57:38.437 --> 01:57:38.697]  Ha!
[01:57:39.098 --> 01:57:40.018]  Bless your soul.
[01:57:40.618 --> 01:57:43.580]  The best part of the interview was the guy's reaction after he said that.
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:46.242]  Just looking at him like, like, what are you?
[01:57:46.562 --> 01:57:46.842]  You know?
[01:57:47.403 --> 01:57:49.444]  The unbelievable, uh, the, uh...
[01:57:50.589 --> 01:57:52.811]  Audacity to be able to have opinions like that.
[01:57:53.071 --> 01:57:53.992]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:57:54.312 --> 01:57:55.894]  Well, he's a self-appointed jerk.
[01:57:56.154 --> 01:57:56.755]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:57.335 --> 01:58:00.858]  Well, the good news is that they're not, they're, the Emperor has no clothes.
[01:58:00.898 --> 01:58:04.441]  I don't think Sam Harris has any idea of how insane he looks.
[01:58:04.562 --> 01:58:07.224]  I mean, otherwise he wouldn't be in front of a camera talking like that.
[01:58:07.244 --> 01:58:09.186]  He was so confident, like you said, and so smug.
[01:58:09.986 --> 01:58:10.967]  The Emperor has no clothes.
[01:58:11.448 --> 01:58:12.008]  And they're everywhere.
[01:58:12.028 --> 01:58:14.751]  They have no idea that the rest of us can see right through them.
[01:58:16.428 --> 01:58:17.909]  And that's just happening more and more and more.
[01:58:17.949 --> 01:58:18.630]  More people waking up.
[01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:26.717]  The more Sam Harris's that come out and talk crazy stuff like that, at least, I don't know how many more people are going to be then tapped on the head and be like, oh, wait a second, what's going on?
[01:58:26.737 --> 01:58:28.038]  That's right, they can't help themselves.
[01:58:28.559 --> 01:58:29.079]  No, they can't.
[01:58:29.660 --> 01:58:35.445]  And the more this goes on and exponentially gets worse, the more we're going to have crazy stuff like that.
[01:58:35.485 --> 01:58:37.587]  And don't they get, they're going to be left with the bill.
[01:58:39.275 --> 01:58:44.819]  Well that's the thing, you know, that shows you how loyal the devil is.
[01:58:44.839 --> 01:58:52.404]  Because all these people, a lot of these people, the Pelosi's and all these people, they've dedicated their lives to this evil force.
[01:58:52.684 --> 01:58:53.905]  And what are they getting returned?
[01:58:54.025 --> 01:58:58.848]  They're just getting put out to pasture and used one last time for the devil's work.
[01:58:59.028 --> 01:59:00.029]  There's no loyalty.
[01:59:00.129 --> 01:59:01.930]  All these people are going to pay the bill like you said.
[01:59:01.970 --> 01:59:03.291]  There is no reward.
[01:59:03.331 --> 01:59:04.732]  And all there is is loyalty.
[01:59:06.913 --> 01:59:07.514]  They don't even get it.
[01:59:09.184 --> 01:59:09.504]  You're right.
[01:59:09.544 --> 01:59:10.345]  That's really all there.
[01:59:10.365 --> 01:59:12.566]  That's how friendships are forged.
[01:59:12.606 --> 01:59:18.849]  That's how anything between people, anything in civilization is done through a trust, through an agreement.
[01:59:19.689 --> 01:59:27.733]  And in order to have that and have it thrive, you need openness, you need transparency, you need to play fair.
[01:59:27.753 --> 01:59:28.874]  But it's a drug.
[01:59:29.874 --> 01:59:31.675]  Nirvana is trust and goodness.
[01:59:32.616 --> 01:59:33.216]  That's family.
[01:59:33.356 --> 01:59:34.296]  Why would they not want that?
[01:59:36.687 --> 01:59:47.389]  Well, the only reason I can think of is because they want to take away everything that's good in hopes that maybe we'll then fall on our knees to them and ask them for help.
[01:59:47.749 --> 01:59:48.909]  And they'll finally be fulfilled.
[01:59:49.169 --> 01:59:49.329]  Yeah.
[01:59:49.369 --> 01:59:53.190]  Because they see God in us, and not that we're God, they see God in us.
[01:59:53.230 --> 01:59:54.450]  They want God to worship them.
[01:59:54.570 --> 01:59:55.631]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:59:55.651 --> 01:59:56.971]  And it's not going to happen, scumbags.
[01:59:57.411 --> 01:59:57.571]  Nope.
[01:59:58.231 --> 01:59:58.931]  It's not going to happen.
[01:59:58.971 --> 02:00:00.732]  That's the biggest deception of all this.
[02:00:00.912 --> 02:00:01.792]  Stay right there, Gregg Rays.
[02:00:03.027 --> 02:00:06.950]  All right, Kevin and many other callers have been holding patiently here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:07.370 --> 02:00:13.455]  We're about to go to your phone calls with the great researcher and filmmaker Greg Reese here with us.
[02:00:13.475 --> 02:00:19.400]  We'll ride shotgun in the next hour and then a little bit the next hour we'll have Jay Dyer take over.
[02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:20.901]  Another great mind.
[02:00:21.922 --> 02:00:24.344]  Before I go back to these calls, anything else you want to add, Greg Reese?
[02:00:26.024 --> 02:00:40.402]  You know, Jess, we're really at the peak of all this right now, and the way I see it, total victory is going to be to where InfoWars can exit appropriately to the point where we're no longer needed and we can bow out.
[02:00:40.502 --> 02:00:41.423]  That's my vision.
[02:00:44.062 --> 02:00:51.948]  So, uh, at this point is when we need the most support so that, because they see our defeat as the defeat of the populist movement.
[02:00:52.509 --> 02:00:53.470]  And so it's very symbolic.
[02:00:54.190 --> 02:00:55.431]  And so that's how I see victory.
[02:00:55.511 --> 02:01:00.315]  And I actually see us pushing all the way and being destroyed publicly as Christ-like.
[02:01:00.335 --> 02:01:01.997]  I'm not comparing myself to Christ, but it repeats.
[02:01:02.577 --> 02:01:05.920]  I actually know that's coming, but we've got to really push hard right to the end.
[02:01:06.080 --> 02:01:06.500]  Exactly.
[02:01:06.941 --> 02:01:07.301]  Exactly.
[02:01:07.521 --> 02:01:10.283]  Because that will inspire, like, the heads of the Hydra, you know?
[02:01:10.944 --> 02:01:17.952]   If they can cut us off, it's just going to create a A legion of info warriors pushing the truth.
[02:01:18.573 --> 02:01:19.794]  Because you can't stop the truth.
[02:01:20.796 --> 02:01:21.597]  You cannot stop it.
[02:01:23.540 --> 02:01:24.641]  And they're just failing miserably.
[02:01:24.661 --> 02:01:26.684]  Spiritually, Greg, what do you see coming in the future?
[02:01:29.713 --> 02:01:34.635]  I see the darkest days ahead, but I don't see them as bad as I used to.
[02:01:34.675 --> 02:01:36.856]  For a while I saw a lot of doom and gloom.
[02:01:36.936 --> 02:01:45.961]  Now I see maybe two weeks, three weeks of chaos maybe, but I see also humanity rising up and taking care of the situation.
[02:01:46.941 --> 02:01:50.945]  And we, the people, building back better, basically.
[02:01:51.225 --> 02:01:54.447]  Because we're an extremely innovative species.
[02:01:54.868 --> 02:01:56.089]  We're extremely resilient.
[02:01:56.269 --> 02:01:57.730]  That's one thing we've learned over the past few years.
[02:01:57.750 --> 02:02:01.073]  And as long as we don't follow their directives and follow God's, we'll rebuild easily.
[02:02:01.453 --> 02:02:01.793]  Easily.
[02:02:02.394 --> 02:02:03.255]  It will be almost effortless.
[02:02:03.275 --> 02:02:05.076]  When they say build back, they mean never build back.
[02:02:05.096 --> 02:02:08.019]  No, all we got to do is show up to work and God will take care of the rest.
[02:02:08.039 --> 02:02:12.062]  All we got to do is show up and do the work and build that trust with each other.
[02:02:12.342 --> 02:02:15.565]  And not only will it be easy, it will be a golden age.
[02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:20.463]  Everything they do is, don't trust each other, you're worthless, you're scum, you're ugly.
[02:02:20.723 --> 02:02:23.365]  No, you're beautiful, you're powerful, you're amazing.
[02:02:23.385 --> 02:02:23.365]  100%.
[02:02:23.665 --> 02:02:26.907]  That's why they're attacking the family, because that's where you learn that first, is from your mother.
[02:02:27.588 --> 02:02:36.454]  You know, if you take a mother out of the equation, where we learn our love, and we learn that we're actually worthy of love, then they can do anything to us.
[02:02:36.895 --> 02:02:38.556]  Well, they teach you the state's going to give you that love.
[02:02:38.776 --> 02:02:38.996]  Right.
[02:02:40.237 --> 02:02:41.198]  And how is that going to happen?
[02:02:43.396 --> 02:02:43.936]  It's insane.
[02:02:44.596 --> 02:02:50.019]  Replace a woman that God gave us, the goddess, the engine of life with the state.
[02:02:50.159 --> 02:02:52.159]  What a disgusting joke.
[02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:54.220]  It's like the ultimate disgusting joke.
[02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:58.082]  Well that's the whole Drag Queen story time, is replace women with big fat ugly men.
[02:02:58.482 --> 02:02:59.822]  Right, exactly.
[02:03:00.363 --> 02:03:01.163]  It's an abomination.
[02:03:01.263 --> 02:03:07.325]  Yeah, and with the sporting events, it's destroying the woman, right?
[02:03:07.525 --> 02:03:10.367]  And everybody knows if you allow an attack on the women, you're done.
[02:03:10.967 --> 02:03:11.127]  Yeah.
[02:03:12.068 --> 02:03:12.548]  Absolutely.
[02:03:13.268 --> 02:03:14.809]  I mean, that's our life.
[02:03:14.989 --> 02:03:16.189]  That's life right there.
[02:03:16.889 --> 02:03:18.209]  That is life.
[02:03:18.970 --> 02:03:24.091]  That's why a righteous man will take care of a woman and protect women and honor women.
[02:03:24.571 --> 02:03:25.471]  Because that's our future.
[02:03:26.952 --> 02:03:27.872]  Let's go to phone calls.
[02:03:28.472 --> 02:03:29.212]  Cabin in New York.
[02:03:29.252 --> 02:03:30.872]  Thanks for holding her on the air with Gregory.
[02:03:30.892 --> 02:03:31.213]  Go ahead.
[02:03:32.513 --> 02:03:33.273]  Alex, my man.
[02:03:33.393 --> 02:03:34.513]  Greg, great work.
[02:03:34.753 --> 02:03:35.293]  Keep going.
[02:03:36.174 --> 02:03:37.354]  Real quick, Diet Force.
[02:03:37.978 --> 02:03:44.300]  Alex, you and I are the same build, and that stuff rocks, so keep selling that.
[02:03:44.781 --> 02:03:45.461]  And you look great, man.
[02:03:45.481 --> 02:03:48.342]  I can see you lost a little bit of weight there, so you look good.
[02:03:49.643 --> 02:03:58.946]  I keep reading about the Donald Trump lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, and then the correlation to the raid on Mar-a-Lago.
[02:03:59.626 --> 02:04:01.667]  I don't know if you've touched upon it.
[02:04:02.527 --> 02:04:03.588]  What are your thoughts on that?
[02:04:04.813 --> 02:04:07.694]  I mean, Trump's got an incredible suit for Russiagate being a FOX.
[02:04:08.374 --> 02:04:15.077]  And the very same judge that raided him, recused himself off the case, and then swat Team Trump, so it's pretty obvious.
[02:04:15.097 --> 02:04:16.538]  Yeah.
[02:04:16.798 --> 02:04:21.319]  Do you think Trump has, like, some microfiche or phone book, all their documentation somewhere?
[02:04:21.339 --> 02:04:22.800]  I mean, is he smart enough to do that?
[02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:24.781]  Well, he's allowed to have all that.
[02:04:24.801 --> 02:04:26.361]  He's the president of the executive branch.
[02:04:26.381 --> 02:04:27.022]  That's in the U.S.
[02:04:27.082 --> 02:04:27.382]  law.
[02:04:28.122 --> 02:04:29.182]  But yeah, that's why they're pissed.
[02:04:29.202 --> 02:04:30.283]  They don't see him as a real president.
[02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:34.110]  What do you think, Gregory?
[02:04:34.150 --> 02:04:34.710]  Thank you, Kevin.
[02:04:34.730 --> 02:04:45.539]  You know, I'm still trying to figure the whole thing out, but the one thing I do know about that for sure is that now everyone's talking about getting rid of the FBI, which I think is great.
[02:04:45.899 --> 02:04:48.781]  Like 80% of national polls, they screwed the post.
[02:04:48.842 --> 02:04:49.142]  Oh yeah.
[02:04:51.786 --> 02:04:53.027]  That's the best part of the whole thing.
[02:04:53.107 --> 02:04:57.929]  And once again, now we're talking about getting rid of the Fed, we're talking about getting rid of the IRS.
[02:04:57.969 --> 02:05:01.291]  That's right, they can keep abusing their power, but they're hurting themselves.
[02:05:01.531 --> 02:05:03.853]  We're at a Ron Paul revolution right now.
[02:05:03.873 --> 02:05:08.115]  When Ron Paul was running, I loved his ideas, but I remember thinking, there's no way.
[02:05:08.215 --> 02:05:09.656]  And that's why we've got to be patient.
[02:05:09.696 --> 02:05:11.697]  Things take, it doesn't happen right away.
[02:05:11.757 --> 02:05:12.117]  Exactly.
[02:05:12.137 --> 02:05:13.958]  Alright, thank you sir.
[02:05:14.438 --> 02:05:16.800]  Terry in California, you're on the air with Greg Reese, go ahead.
[02:05:18.321 --> 02:05:19.781]  Hi gentlemen, good to talk to you.
[02:05:21.511 --> 02:05:37.457]  It's an honor, and my idea is just sort of a logo or something to take their ideas and flip them on their head, because everything they do is a lie, like to build back better.
[02:05:38.797 --> 02:05:39.537]  When's it start?
[02:05:41.418 --> 02:05:44.139]  One idea I had is the end is near.
[02:05:44.579 --> 02:05:46.320]  The great reset is here.
[02:05:46.340 --> 02:05:52.649]   I think the memes are great, but They're almost throwaway.
[02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:56.192]  You know, I think they're powerful if they can make that spark.
[02:05:57.653 --> 02:06:04.159]  But something that really ties into their propaganda.
[02:06:06.261 --> 02:06:07.162]  I think you're right, Greg.
[02:06:07.202 --> 02:06:08.222]  Thanks for the call, Terry.
[02:06:10.004 --> 02:06:17.737]   Yeah, you know, the Build Back Better thing is interesting, too, because it's like when they started pushing that Build Back Better right away, it seemed kind of clear that Build what back?
[02:06:17.917 --> 02:06:20.979]  You know, when they're all pushing destruction and they're saying, build back better.
[02:06:21.399 --> 02:06:24.982]  Which just tells me that they really, really are counting on us being asleep.
[02:06:25.122 --> 02:06:26.883]  Their plan only works if we're asleep.
[02:06:26.903 --> 02:06:27.384]  It's cartoonish!
[02:06:27.564 --> 02:06:28.465]  It's cartoonish, yeah.
[02:06:29.305 --> 02:06:31.447]  The only way it works is if we're total dummies.
[02:06:32.508 --> 02:06:33.548]  And we're not all total dummies.
[02:06:35.910 --> 02:06:37.231]  Let's talk to another caller.
[02:06:37.271 --> 02:06:39.133]  Let's talk to Larry in Florida.
[02:06:39.173 --> 02:06:39.533]  Go ahead.
[02:06:39.553 --> 02:06:42.175]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:06:42.715 --> 02:06:44.917]  It's a privilege and honor to be talking to you and Greg.
[02:06:45.735 --> 02:06:46.755]  I have two things.
[02:06:47.076 --> 02:06:51.717]  One, Greg's comment about the lesions of the InfoWarriors.
[02:06:52.398 --> 02:07:13.143]   I'm thinking that maybe that would be something that does a response to Klaus Schwab's 100,000 InfoCheckers, so to speak, and that it might also be a way to add a little money to the checking account at InfoWarriors, as if you had just a real, not subscriber, just a basic membership,
[02:07:13.143 --> 02:07:17.822]   10 bucks, get up for that, we get a little decal that I can proudly put in the window.
[02:07:17.822 --> 02:07:20.182]  And a little short class on our ethics.
[02:07:20.182 --> 02:07:22.382]  That's a great idea, that's a great idea, brother.
[02:07:22.382 --> 02:07:28.542]   That is a great idea because by, I think people are more inclined to take action
[02:07:28.542 --> 02:07:29.983]  if they invest in it.
[02:07:29.983 --> 02:07:30.822]  And so I think you're--
[02:07:30.822 --> 02:07:32.342]  But then they need a blueprint of action.
[02:07:32.342 --> 02:07:37.222]   Yes, exactly, and then part of this subscription would, like you said, would just be a blueprint of action.
[02:07:37.222 --> 02:07:39.422]  And we've got more, we'll have more than 10,000.
[02:07:39.422 --> 02:07:40.783]  100%.
[02:07:41.210 --> 02:07:41.950]  That's a great idea.
[02:07:41.970 --> 02:07:42.751]  Anything else, Larry?
[02:07:42.791 --> 02:07:44.172]  I'm going to implement your idea, brother.
[02:07:44.712 --> 02:07:46.633]  Yeah, just it's not a subscription.
[02:07:46.673 --> 02:07:51.516]  It's just a, in my mind, you know, you're the man, but it's just a basic membership.
[02:07:51.676 --> 02:07:53.037]  One time deal.
[02:07:53.377 --> 02:07:54.078]  One way or the other.
[02:07:54.098 --> 02:07:54.398]  Yeah.
[02:07:54.858 --> 02:07:57.340]  One time deal or once a year, like Judicial Watch does.
[02:07:58.491 --> 02:08:03.854]  And I think you'll end up making Klaus Schwab's 100,000 look puny.
[02:08:03.894 --> 02:08:05.295]  I think you'll have a million in a month.
[02:08:05.615 --> 02:08:06.035]  That's right.
[02:08:06.095 --> 02:08:07.316]  I thought of this this morning.
[02:08:07.576 --> 02:08:08.517]  It's crazy you called.
[02:08:08.937 --> 02:08:11.478]  I had like a brainstorm before the show, and then I don't cover most of it.
[02:08:11.879 --> 02:08:14.380]  I was thinking we should launch an army to counter Schwab.
[02:08:14.660 --> 02:08:15.440]  We've already launched it.
[02:08:15.481 --> 02:08:16.661]  We should make it very clear now.
[02:08:16.681 --> 02:08:21.884]  We need a battle plan, basic directives, our code of conduct, so they can't misrepresent us, and then launch it.
[02:08:22.064 --> 02:08:22.745]  Greg, help me do it.
[02:08:22.925 --> 02:08:23.165]  Yeah.
[02:08:23.445 --> 02:08:24.485]  You're lovely, Larry.
[02:08:24.526 --> 02:08:24.966]  We love you.
[02:08:25.526 --> 02:08:26.767]  Let me just go ahead and say this now.
[02:08:28.447 --> 02:08:31.932]  And I don't make this announcement to try to act tough or powerful or any of this.
[02:08:33.254 --> 02:08:34.817]  In fact, it's so big I can't talk about it.
[02:08:35.478 --> 02:08:37.200]  I'm not being dramatic here.
[02:08:37.801 --> 02:08:40.585]  I'm not ready to talk about this yet because it's such a big deal.
[02:08:42.208 --> 02:08:43.149]  It's actually quite frightening.
[02:08:46.021 --> 02:08:51.522]  Everybody thought the Cube movement was secretly in touch with army intelligence and the resistance movement and all the rest of that.
[02:08:52.082 --> 02:08:53.923]  Most of the Pentagon leadership are globalist.
[02:08:54.363 --> 02:08:56.403]  Most of our militaries control the grassroots of great people.
[02:08:57.004 --> 02:09:02.765]  But I can tell you that over the years and here currently, I don't get orders from these people.
[02:09:03.785 --> 02:09:10.287]  In fact, I was always listened to for over 20 years, but now it's been recognized that I'm a leader.
[02:09:10.927 --> 02:09:12.387]  And I don't say that to act powerful.
[02:09:12.427 --> 02:09:13.527]  It's actually a great responsibility.
[02:09:13.547 --> 02:09:15.028]  It's not recognized I'm the leader.
[02:09:16.222 --> 02:09:24.413]  And so whatever's left of the CIA and the military actually looks for us for leadership and have asked us to be the leader.
[02:09:25.094 --> 02:09:27.357]  And I don't say that again to act powerful or to say that's a big deal.
[02:09:27.377 --> 02:09:28.218]  The enemy already knows it.
[02:09:28.598 --> 02:09:29.820]  That's why Klaus Schwab is doing all this.
[02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:30.881]  But God did this.
[02:09:31.282 --> 02:09:31.822]  You did this.
[02:09:32.223 --> 02:09:33.505]  Infowars is now seen as a leader.
[02:09:34.156 --> 02:09:36.617]  Alex, before I came out here, I mentioned Wednesday's show.
[02:09:37.257 --> 02:09:49.981]  That's the feeling I got watching you on Wednesday was almost like watching you on air accept that role, which is something I know you've been not that excited about.
[02:09:50.801 --> 02:09:52.541]  You haven't always seen yourself as a leader.
[02:09:53.262 --> 02:09:53.982]  You're just doing your job.
[02:09:54.002 --> 02:09:57.463]  But Wednesday, I felt like you, because here's what it is.
[02:09:58.323 --> 02:09:58.903]  Trump is good.
[02:09:59.163 --> 02:09:59.864]  We need leadership.
[02:09:59.904 --> 02:10:00.644]  We need a president.
[02:10:03.132 --> 02:10:05.855]  I see you more as a leader for this movement than Trump.
[02:10:07.876 --> 02:10:11.359]  Well, that actually scares me to think that the divorce is the best we've got.
[02:10:11.379 --> 02:10:12.240]  I know.
[02:10:13.601 --> 02:10:16.824]  It's, it's, it's, um... That's what they said.
[02:10:16.884 --> 02:10:19.166]  They said, I said, I'm not the leader.
[02:10:19.206 --> 02:10:20.668]  They said, you're all we got.
[02:10:21.869 --> 02:10:23.030]  That's how bad this is, folks.
[02:10:23.730 --> 02:10:25.372]  We'll be right back with your phone calls on number four.
[02:10:25.392 --> 02:10:25.772]  Stay with us.
[02:10:26.573 --> 02:10:27.334]  This is real folks.
[02:10:28.612 --> 02:10:38.019]  Alright Greg, we're taking phone calls right now and we're to the realization that they've wiped out the leadership and it's up to the people now to be leaders.
[02:10:38.839 --> 02:10:45.965]  Yeah, you know I've been visiting with the crew since I've been back and that's basically the conversation I've been having with everyone is that none of us can believe that we're...
[02:10:47.585 --> 02:10:48.406]  Really, the tip of the spear.
[02:10:48.426 --> 02:10:50.186]  I mean, we've been saying that for a while, but we really are.
[02:10:50.286 --> 02:10:52.928]  And we're right up in the front of all this.
[02:10:53.408 --> 02:10:54.048]  And we really are.
[02:10:54.068 --> 02:10:56.229]  You always refer to us as this ragtag crew.
[02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:57.290]  It really is.
[02:10:57.370 --> 02:10:58.530]  It's almost like out of a movie.
[02:10:58.550 --> 02:11:00.591]  I wish people could really see what this place is like.
[02:11:00.671 --> 02:11:10.496]  It's just a... salt of the earth, good American folks, and I don't think anyone here can believe the impact that we're having right now.
[02:11:10.816 --> 02:11:11.436]  It's the listeners.
[02:11:11.496 --> 02:11:11.937]  They're the bell.
[02:11:11.977 --> 02:11:12.417]  Well, it is.
[02:11:12.477 --> 02:11:12.897]  Absolutely.
[02:11:12.937 --> 02:11:13.437]  It's our audience.
[02:11:13.457 --> 02:11:15.058]  Without our audience, we wouldn't be having this.
[02:11:15.118 --> 02:11:16.239]  That's who the enemy hates. 100%.
[02:11:17.512 --> 02:11:26.857]  In fact, we owe it to our audience more than ever now to be on our best game and to work as hard as we possibly can because as long as they're putting fuel in our tank, we need to just drive and drive and drive and push forward.
[02:11:27.478 --> 02:11:27.978]  More than ever.
[02:11:28.938 --> 02:11:29.579]  And it's an honor.
[02:11:29.979 --> 02:11:33.541]  It's as crazy as it is, it's an unbelievable honor.
[02:11:33.601 --> 02:11:37.703]  It's surreal to realize the role that we're playing right now.
[02:11:37.723 --> 02:11:40.705]  And when we see our enemies and how much they hate us, that's when we know we're over the target.
[02:11:40.745 --> 02:11:40.985]  Yes.
[02:11:41.185 --> 02:11:43.006]  I mean, they hate our guts.
[02:11:43.046 --> 02:11:43.687]  They hate you.
[02:11:44.821 --> 02:11:47.182]  But they've far from broken our will, it's the opposite.
[02:11:47.882 --> 02:11:49.083]  It's exactly the opposite.
[02:11:49.303 --> 02:11:52.444]  Manuel in California, thanks for holding it on the air worldwide.
[02:11:52.464 --> 02:11:55.686]  Nice to talk to you Alex.
[02:11:56.406 --> 02:12:07.911]  I've been keeping up on the dangers of the mRNA, and you've been saying today how a lot of the countries, they're not taking it, they're letting it expire and all that, and I'm afraid they have a backup plan.
[02:12:09.005 --> 02:12:15.329]  If he can bring up an article from the University of California, the title is Grow and Eat Your Own Vaccines?
[02:12:15.849 --> 02:12:16.469]  Question mark?
[02:12:16.890 --> 02:12:19.091]  Oh yeah, Bill Gates wants edible vaccines.
[02:12:20.172 --> 02:12:21.512]  Yeah, and it's an mRNA.
[02:12:22.393 --> 02:12:27.256]  And I don't know if you guys can look up this guy called Juan Pablo Giraldo.
[02:12:27.656 --> 02:12:29.297]  He's also involved in nanotech.
[02:12:30.655 --> 02:12:37.097]  But they talk about the danger of the injection is you have to keep it cold all the time, and it can affect the storage and all that.
[02:12:37.197 --> 02:12:39.457]  So the good idea is, well, just put it in your food.
[02:12:40.378 --> 02:12:47.319]  So they're already working on this, and we're just now finding out the side effects of the injection, and now they want to put this garbage in the food.
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:50.960]  And suddenly nanoplastic and nanotech's being found in everybody?
[02:12:50.980 --> 02:12:53.341]  I mean, yeah, no, we're in the middle of the attack.
[02:12:54.341 --> 02:12:55.301]  You can get around it.
[02:12:55.402 --> 02:13:00.784]  I mean, I've seen documentaries from Monsanto how they were growing a pesticide inside the corn.
[02:13:01.424 --> 02:13:08.828]  The guy took the husk off the stalk, pulled back the peeling, and there were dead bugs inside because they were eating the corn.
[02:13:09.448 --> 02:13:11.549]  So what's going to happen if people eat that over time?
[02:13:13.255 --> 02:13:16.197]  I'm trying to make us eat exoskeletons, which is pure poison.
[02:13:16.457 --> 02:13:20.361]  Yeah, and the corn's already GMO, and it's already making people sick as it is.
[02:13:20.881 --> 02:13:24.984]  And that goes back to the solution that you were talking about, about people starting to grow their own gardens.
[02:13:25.024 --> 02:13:25.945]  That's the way around this.
[02:13:27.306 --> 02:13:33.932]  I'm very picky about where I go to eat and the groceries I buy right now, especially because of all this mRNA and the lettuce and nanotech.
[02:13:35.173 --> 02:13:35.934]  That's the solution.
[02:13:36.034 --> 02:13:37.335]  Know where your food's coming from.
[02:13:38.115 --> 02:13:38.656]  Buy local.
[02:13:39.337 --> 02:13:39.897]  Absolutely.
[02:13:39.937 --> 02:13:40.738]  God bless you, brother.
[02:13:41.864 --> 02:13:42.925]  Alright, let's take another call.
[02:13:43.946 --> 02:13:45.927]  Talks to George in Connecticut, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:13:46.428 --> 02:13:52.972]  Hey Alex, I have three points for you and the last one is to promote one of your sponsors as well.
[02:13:53.813 --> 02:13:56.035]  Hold on, I apologize George, I didn't look at the clock.
[02:13:56.675 --> 02:13:57.676]  Hold for one minute, okay?
[02:13:58.076 --> 02:13:58.417]  Okay.
[02:13:58.757 --> 02:14:00.318]  It's only a one minute break, sorry George.
[02:14:00.858 --> 02:14:03.400]  And then we'll get to T, Ruben, Tucker, and Yanni.
[02:14:03.781 --> 02:14:13.344]   That'll be it for calls, because the great Jay Dyer is about to take over here on these forbidden transmissions, but Greg, you've got to get on the show more often with us, brother.
[02:14:13.624 --> 02:14:15.065]  I know, I know, I know, I know.
[02:14:15.866 --> 02:14:16.426]  I miss it here.
[02:14:17.086 --> 02:14:20.988]  You can find all, you just couldn't stand Austin anymore, neither could Leon McAdoo.
[02:14:21.549 --> 02:14:23.350]  I get it, you want to run to Florida, which makes sense.
[02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:26.111]  I've looked at coming back, it's just... I'm going to run to Florida with you, probably.
[02:14:26.211 --> 02:14:29.013]  You can find Gregory's reports at Band.Video.
[02:14:29.673 --> 02:14:31.915]  Just click the left-hand corner and find Greg Reese right there.
[02:14:31.935 --> 02:14:32.836]  It's by the fourth link down.
[02:14:33.276 --> 02:14:35.278]  Greg Reese in studio with us.
[02:14:35.338 --> 02:14:37.159]  All right, George in Connecticut.
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:40.702]  We're gonna come back in 60 seconds and talk to you and others.
[02:14:42.644 --> 02:14:45.446]  I want to thank listeners for putting us in this position to fight back.
[02:14:45.466 --> 02:14:48.308]  I want to thank you for everything we've done together.
[02:14:48.789 --> 02:14:49.369]  And I mean that.
[02:14:51.871 --> 02:14:53.373]  All right, go back to Georgia, Connecticut.
[02:14:53.413 --> 02:14:54.594]  George, sorry to cut you off of the break.
[02:14:54.614 --> 02:14:54.854]  Go ahead.
[02:14:55.481 --> 02:14:56.902]  Yeah, I have three points.
[02:14:56.922 --> 02:15:02.064]  The last one is to actually promote one of your sponsors, as well as promoting an idea.
[02:15:02.624 --> 02:15:06.646]  The first idea is to scare the living daylights out of the people who are trying to take you down.
[02:15:07.046 --> 02:15:19.311]  Look, if you just dare to say, look, you take me down, I'm going to start going to every town, just like Trump does, and stadiums and filling them, and we're going to get people organized in each town.
[02:15:19.351 --> 02:15:21.432]  Brother, brother, it's already planned.
[02:15:22.212 --> 02:15:22.993]  All right, all right.
[02:15:23.033 --> 02:15:25.094]  So that's the first point.
[02:15:25.614 --> 02:15:30.216]  Second point, the real militia is in the Constitution to the state.
[02:15:30.456 --> 02:15:37.940]  Each state governor is the head of the militia, and he can basically make a proclamation.
[02:15:38.220 --> 02:15:45.643]   Every man, woman, and citizen over 16 and under 60 who's able-bodied All right, George, we love you.
[02:15:45.964 --> 02:15:46.944]  We appreciate you.
[02:15:46.764 --> 02:15:52.483]   borders when the government is. And every governor could do that and they could send
[02:15:52.483 --> 02:15:56.963]  them to all the border states as well, not just their state.
[02:15:56.963 --> 02:15:58.884]  But he could militia them.
[02:15:58.884 --> 02:16:04.323]   That is the real militia. There's a person on the Rents Network that was talking about
[02:16:04.323 --> 02:16:06.283]  this and he's a constitutional lawyer.
[02:16:06.283 --> 02:16:10.524]   All right, George, we love you. We appreciate you. Greg, you want to comment on that?
[02:16:10.524 --> 02:16:17.524]   All I want to comment on is I want you to keep me abreast of the world tour.
[02:16:16.831 --> 02:16:17.892]  I want to be a part of that if I can help.
[02:16:17.912 --> 02:16:21.934]  Well, no, I mean, there's big backers who want to do that.
[02:16:22.314 --> 02:16:23.375]  There's a lot of stuff in the wings.
[02:16:23.635 --> 02:16:28.138]  We're going to keep this horse going as a big example to everybody.
[02:16:28.398 --> 02:16:37.864]  Those who think they're going to shut us down, man, them and that trial two weeks ago saying we're going to shut him down, we're going to silence everybody else, they could have done better work for us.
[02:16:37.944 --> 02:16:38.124]  I know.
[02:16:39.315 --> 02:16:40.556]  They screwed the pooch right there.
[02:16:41.237 --> 02:16:42.979]  Let's go to T in Arizona.
[02:16:43.039 --> 02:16:43.720]  T, you're on the air.
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:44.100]  Go ahead.
[02:16:46.082 --> 02:16:47.363]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:16:47.604 --> 02:16:50.347]  Greg, thank you guys for opening my eyes years ago.
[02:16:50.367 --> 02:16:54.931]  About five years ago, I've been working for the better part of three decades in high tech, right?
[02:16:55.971 --> 02:16:59.314]  Um, the first time I heard your transmission, I was pretty off-put.
[02:16:59.394 --> 02:17:00.234]  I was pissed off.
[02:17:00.294 --> 02:17:04.478]  I grew up in a very conservative home, but I said, oh, there's no way this is taking place, right?
[02:17:04.518 --> 02:17:07.480]  These things that he's talking about, they're absolutely lies.
[02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:10.442]  No, you were correct, and I appreciate it.
[02:17:10.842 --> 02:17:14.345]  And 100% changed my life, my perspective, and my future.
[02:17:14.805 --> 02:17:17.207]  I wanted to take a second to plug Xfree and Winter Sun.
[02:17:17.628 --> 02:17:18.688]  Really awesome product.
[02:17:18.769 --> 02:17:23.513]  They've changed to also, I have thyroid disease, so it helps me with my own problems, you know, my health.
[02:17:23.893 --> 02:17:26.575]  Anybody else out there looking at those problems, look at it.
[02:17:26.635 --> 02:17:28.777]  They have great products at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:17:29.718 --> 02:17:40.991]   Another piece, as I said, that I wanted to touch on was, somebody earlier asked, how do we discuss, like, how we can help other people and how we can actually build our Our country stronger, the world stronger, right?
[02:17:41.471 --> 02:17:46.313]  When Galatians 5.13, Alex, he wrote, he wrote the map, right?
[02:17:46.353 --> 02:17:47.213]  We already have this.
[02:17:47.593 --> 02:17:49.374]  That's why the globalists are so pissed off.
[02:17:49.974 --> 02:17:52.735]  He wrote, Call to freedom, brothers.
[02:17:53.315 --> 02:17:59.477]  Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love, serve one another.
[02:18:00.157 --> 02:18:03.879]  So what I started doing is taking the opportunity every time I had the chance.
[02:18:05.219 --> 02:18:08.000]  Someone had an opposite opinion of mine, right?
[02:18:08.746 --> 02:18:10.867]  I would take the chance to be overly nice to them.
[02:18:10.927 --> 02:18:11.667]  Fill them with kindness.
[02:18:12.248 --> 02:18:16.170]  You do that to somebody, and eventually they say, wow, I'm the problem.
[02:18:16.269 --> 02:18:20.589]   And then they start turning around. And it's not about being haughty or who's right and who's wrong, right?
[02:18:20.589 --> 02:18:24.989]   No, I agree. It's taking a leftist shooting or gardening and just treating them as humanity.
[02:18:24.989 --> 02:18:28.188]   That's what they don't want to be in. They want to slot down, watching the television.
[02:18:28.188 --> 02:18:31.149]  Beautiful points, T. Comments on that, Greg Race?
[02:18:31.149 --> 02:18:35.948]   It just made me think about when I discovered InfoWars for the first time back in 2004.
[02:18:36.141 --> 02:18:39.784]  I kind of started waking up to everything, and that's when I found your show.
[02:18:40.024 --> 02:18:48.491]  And what I loved about it, you know, different strokes for different folks, but what I love about InfoWars is it's just all Americana, rock and roll, edgy stuff.
[02:18:48.591 --> 02:18:52.734]  It's just, it's not right-wing, it's not conservative, it's not liberal, it's just Americana.
[02:18:52.935 --> 02:18:54.276]  And that's our audience, I think.
[02:18:54.896 --> 02:18:56.257]  Tucker in Tennessee.
[02:18:56.397 --> 02:18:57.078]  Tucker, welcome.
[02:18:58.539 --> 02:18:59.800]  Sir, good to talk to you.
[02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:00.841]  First time caller?
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:05.161]  I was listening to you and Jade Helm on WINAMP.
[02:19:05.441 --> 02:19:07.522]  I'm a USMC Air Force Veteran.
[02:19:08.462 --> 02:19:09.343]  DNA Force.
[02:19:09.423 --> 02:19:10.403]  I've always wanted it.
[02:19:10.923 --> 02:19:12.484]  Thanks for putting it on Half Price.
[02:19:13.304 --> 02:19:14.124]  I got an order.
[02:19:14.324 --> 02:19:19.586]  I got your book, your Master Club, and Alex Sapir water and air filter.
[02:19:19.626 --> 02:19:20.166]  Thank you, brother.
[02:19:20.206 --> 02:19:21.306]  We wouldn't be on air without you.
[02:19:21.666 --> 02:19:22.707]  Thank you for being our backer.
[02:19:24.307 --> 02:19:24.687]  Yes, sir.
[02:19:24.707 --> 02:19:26.788]  I want to say one thing about those lawyers, man.
[02:19:27.088 --> 02:19:29.669]  He keeps coming off with the alternative facts.
[02:19:30.263 --> 02:19:38.983]   quote and that's like facts are fact so that's just a bunch of BS and then as far as reading
[02:19:38.983 --> 02:19:44.263]   goes if you want to do a speed read the first and last sentence of the paragraph should
[02:19:44.263 --> 02:19:50.622]   give you the idea of the paragraph. I'm a slow reader so try that out and Alex a little
[02:19:50.622 --> 02:19:55.384]   humor here you've been 48 years old forever man what's your secret?
[02:19:55.384 --> 02:19:58.903]  I love you brother. All right thank you.
[02:19:58.925 --> 02:20:02.066]  Let's talk to Ruben in California.
[02:20:02.107 --> 02:20:02.687]  Go ahead, Ruben.
[02:20:04.008 --> 02:20:05.909]  Yeah, this is Ruben in California.
[02:20:05.969 --> 02:20:09.431]  Alex, good to talk to you and a real pleasure to be on with you and Greg at the same time.
[02:20:09.851 --> 02:20:13.653]  I called in a while back and I got the last minute on the Owen Show.
[02:20:13.694 --> 02:20:15.815]  I don't think you understood my point, so I'll make it here.
[02:20:16.375 --> 02:20:17.136]  First point, though.
[02:20:17.776 --> 02:20:29.635]   That previous caller about the idea for the subscription, I feel the most powerful in the info war when I'm able to share the article And show people where to look to see things I've heard from you.
[02:20:30.075 --> 02:20:37.179]  So if there was some type of transcript that you could put up that would lead to the articles that I could just share, hey, there you go, bang, right there.
[02:20:37.999 --> 02:20:59.613]   Second point is that Trump, with the vaccine, they're waiting for him to announce his run, and then they're going to use all of the data that we gathered And all of our researchers and McCullough's and Kennedy's and Tenpenny's and everything say, oh my God, look, this vaccine is hurting people.
[02:20:59.633 --> 02:21:01.294]  Oh, they're going to burn Trump with it.
[02:21:01.334 --> 02:21:02.515]  He's being completely set up.
[02:21:02.615 --> 02:21:03.335]  I totally agree.
[02:21:03.675 --> 02:21:05.757]  I'm Trump's best friend trying to get him to decouple from that.
[02:21:06.097 --> 02:21:07.218]  Thanks for the call, Ruben.
[02:21:07.258 --> 02:21:08.619]  Your take on that, Gregg Reese.
[02:21:08.779 --> 02:21:09.579]  Yeah, I would agree.
[02:21:09.639 --> 02:21:12.461]  That just definitely seems to be what the plan was from the start.
[02:21:12.601 --> 02:21:19.506]  And and I don't think they care about sacrificing big pharma to take down the populist movement and keep their new world order.
[02:21:19.766 --> 02:21:20.527]  So, yeah, I would agree with that.
[02:21:21.428 --> 02:21:22.108]  He's got to stop.
[02:21:22.869 --> 02:21:24.752]  He's got to start talking about the truth about the Vax.
[02:21:27.315 --> 02:21:28.356]  20 in Maryland.
[02:21:28.396 --> 02:21:30.759]  Last caller before Jade Artex.
[02:21:30.779 --> 02:21:31.500]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:21:32.422 --> 02:21:34.584]  Hey, what's going on Alex and Greg?
[02:21:34.825 --> 02:21:38.850]  Greg, you make amazing short videos that wake people up like crazy.
[02:21:39.928 --> 02:21:40.869]  Thank you.
[02:21:41.069 --> 02:21:49.156]  I've been basically, I can thank my friend Sam for waking me up back right after September 11th, and I've been with you guys since.
[02:21:50.557 --> 02:21:51.558]  I use all your products.
[02:21:51.979 --> 02:21:52.459]  Thank you.
[02:21:52.539 --> 02:22:06.652]   But what I wanted to talk about quickly is I heard on Sam Tripoli's show the other day with Monkeypox, they're kind of going to maybe use that so people are going to be okay with it because it's On the homosexual community only.
[02:22:06.672 --> 02:22:09.234]  Oh yeah, that's why they're pushing it like it's oh, it's this, yeah.
[02:22:09.254 --> 02:22:24.025]  Yeah, they're going to put it on the back burner, and then we're going to forget about it, and then they're going to have their breakthroughs, and then all of a sudden everyone's going to be okay with it and locked down because... Remember, two years ago, Bill Gates started ordering smallpox vaccines.
[02:22:24.846 --> 02:22:25.026]  Yep.
[02:22:25.526 --> 02:22:28.869]  And we said, that's the next attack, and monkeypox is a derivative of that.
[02:22:29.730 --> 02:22:33.813]  Yeah, and they get affected also because their immune system's been hurt.
[02:22:34.551 --> 02:22:36.272]  Also, um, from the vaccine.
[02:22:37.113 --> 02:22:43.736]  But, Alex, I've had so many of your citizen rulebooks, I've given so many of those away over the years, it's not even funny.
[02:22:44.237 --> 02:22:46.978]  It's, I've had so much stuff of yours that it's awesome.
[02:22:47.519 --> 02:22:50.741]  Brother, you're the only reason you're on air, and we salute you for keeping us in the fight.
[02:22:51.361 --> 02:22:53.482]  All right, Jay Dyer's about to take over.
[02:22:53.562 --> 02:22:56.084]  Jay's analysis, author, researcher, amazing brain.
[02:22:56.504 --> 02:22:57.785]  He takes over for the next 45 minutes.
[02:22:58.265 --> 02:22:59.686]  One-minute closing comments, Greg Rees.
[02:23:01.107 --> 02:23:02.268]  Just want to thank the audience.
[02:23:02.488 --> 02:23:08.473]  You know, I came out here mostly to be with the family, my crew here at InfoWars, and you're my family too, all of you.
[02:23:08.513 --> 02:23:09.614]  We're all together in this.
[02:23:10.115 --> 02:23:11.956]  It's amazing that we're leading all this.
[02:23:12.317 --> 02:23:16.941]  It's crazy and it's insane, but it's really the American people and just, I want to thank everyone.
[02:23:16.961 --> 02:23:17.421]  Thank everyone.
[02:23:17.441 --> 02:23:18.382]  That's right, they're leading.
[02:23:18.862 --> 02:23:19.703]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:23:20.884 --> 02:23:25.208]  Which shows how pathetic the globalists are, that Klaus Schwab announces InfoWars is the main enemy today?
[02:23:25.488 --> 02:23:25.648]  Yeah.
[02:23:28.479 --> 02:23:34.522]  Yeah, they're failing big time and we just have to keep pushing through at this point and have no fear and pedal to the metal.
[02:23:35.103 --> 02:23:35.743]  Freedom all the way.
[02:23:35.803 --> 02:23:36.523]  Great job, Greg.
[02:23:36.543 --> 02:23:37.504]  Glad to have you here.
[02:23:37.564 --> 02:23:38.044]  Back in town.
[02:23:38.064 --> 02:23:38.865]  He's lived here four years.
[02:23:38.945 --> 02:23:39.925]  Moved to Florida for a while.
[02:23:40.265 --> 02:23:41.206]  He's back with us visiting.
[02:23:41.506 --> 02:23:42.687]  Jay Dyer is about to take over.
[02:23:43.047 --> 02:23:44.868]  Infowars.com forward slash show.

[02:23:53.407 --> 02:23:57.447]   The next few days I'm going to end sign copies of The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[02:23:57.447 --> 02:23:58.447]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:23:58.447 --> 02:23:59.447]  You're incredible.
[02:23:59.447 --> 02:24:01.447]  We're going to win this together with God's help.
[02:24:01.447 --> 02:24:04.927]   All right, Jay Dyer on the other side of this quick break takes over.
[02:24:04.927 --> 02:24:06.927]  He always has the source documents.
[02:24:06.927 --> 02:24:07.927]  It's always informative.
[02:24:07.927 --> 02:24:08.927]  Great job, crew.

[02:25:20.714 --> 02:25:21.855]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:21.875 --> 02:25:24.058]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:30.786]  You know, one of the top questions I get is, what are the top books that actually explain all this?
[02:25:30.826 --> 02:25:33.169]  Could you do a top 10 books of the elite?
[02:25:33.269 --> 02:25:38.715]  And maybe if I don't have time to read all those, could you summarize those top 10 books where the elite tell us everything?
[02:25:38.735 --> 02:25:39.976]  They lay out all the plans.
[02:25:40.456 --> 02:25:41.558]  And yes, I've done that for you.
[02:25:41.578 --> 02:25:43.920]  I'm going to give you the top 10 books from the elite.
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:45.422]  No conspiracy theories.
[02:25:46.122 --> 02:26:03.059]  Just the writings of the elite from about the last hundred or maybe in a few thousand years ago that tell us exactly how they structure and control the masses and want to create this synthetic reality known as the New World Order and the transhumanist metaverse, the matrix that they want to bring in.
[02:26:03.723 --> 02:26:07.984]  The first book I would say you need to be familiar with to understand the elite perspective.
[02:26:08.464 --> 02:26:13.545]  You want to get that real master's degree level education that the elite have.
[02:26:14.205 --> 02:26:21.326]  And a lot of these books are actually books that they use in international relations programs for people getting their master's or their PhD or whatever.
[02:26:21.346 --> 02:26:26.347]  I would say the first that we have to understand is the infamous Plato's Republic.
[02:26:26.467 --> 02:26:28.627]  Now Plato was a brilliant philosopher.
[02:26:29.066 --> 02:26:35.905]   He was working within a tradition of Greek philosophy that pulled from what he called the Egyptian mysteries.
[02:26:35.905 --> 02:26:41.306]   If you read the Timaeus, there's a famous dialogue of Plato's origin of the universe.
[02:26:41.306 --> 02:26:48.346]   In that dialogue, Plato talks about how the secrets and the mysteries of Egypt, including how to rule mankind,
[02:26:48.346 --> 02:26:51.866]  would be passed down in his writings.
[02:26:51.866 --> 02:26:57.146]   And so other books like the Republic are a way to kind of classify and structure and order reality
[02:26:57.146 --> 02:26:59.146]  in a mathematical way.
[02:26:58.925 --> 02:27:08.148]  Plato had a quasi-mystical divine view of mathematics, much like Pythagoras, such that he thought that that was the secret to really organizing all reality.
[02:27:08.728 --> 02:27:22.286]   And the Greeks pioneered this idea of techne, right, which would eventually give us technology, the idea that we could just use machines and technological quantification, numbers, to structure and order all of reality.
[02:27:22.286 --> 02:27:28.385]   So technocracy is something that the Greeks, and particularly Plato, were, you could say,
[02:27:28.385 --> 02:27:29.685]  proto-pioneers of.
[02:27:29.685 --> 02:27:37.945]   And so the Republic is Plato's pyramidal structure society where at the top you have the philosopher-king elite
[02:27:37.945 --> 02:27:41.585]   who structure the underclass below them, who are known as the guardians,
[02:27:41.585 --> 02:27:45.085]  who have a completely communist style of life.
[02:27:45.533 --> 02:27:53.838]   Everything in the middle tier of the pyramid, the guardian class who are the warriors, the soldiers, They share wives, they share children.
[02:27:53.918 --> 02:27:58.703]  It's an equalitarian feminist society where women do the exact same things as men.
[02:27:59.204 --> 02:28:02.627]  And then you have the underclass, the working, the proles right underneath.
[02:28:03.143 --> 02:28:38.887]   Then so it's a strict pyramidal three-tiered structure society and even though Plato you know pioneered other ideas like eugenics he didn't have the full-on capacity for you know AI machine technology and all that that we know that today's technocratic elites want to put into place but the seminal ideas for the technocracy are all there in Plato's Republic in fact all of the communist dictatorships Also, drew heavily from Plato's ideal republic, the notion that you could force into reality an ideal government that would bypass human flaws and limitations, human emotions.
[02:28:38.908 --> 02:28:43.592]  These kinds of things can be bypassed by running society in a purely rational way.
[02:28:43.933 --> 02:28:46.495]  But of course, humans aren't purely rational automatons.
[02:28:46.515 --> 02:28:47.316]  We're not robots.
[02:28:47.356 --> 02:28:48.197]  We're not all spurred 5000s.
[02:28:49.278 --> 02:28:51.541]  We're not all Mark Zuckerberg in the metaverse.
[02:28:51.801 --> 02:28:55.405]  I want to make you into a coom pod slug laying there for all of your life.
[02:28:55.425 --> 02:28:56.205]  It's going to be great.
[02:28:56.306 --> 02:28:56.466]  Right?
[02:28:56.486 --> 02:28:57.507]  We're not all like that.
[02:28:57.567 --> 02:28:58.608]  Some of us have free will.
[02:28:58.668 --> 02:29:01.251]  Even though Noah Yuval Harari says, no such thing as free will.
[02:29:02.292 --> 02:29:05.816]  Even though Bertrand Russell says, but of course I must stamp out free will.
[02:29:06.216 --> 02:29:06.356]  Right?
[02:29:06.396 --> 02:29:08.298]  Free will must be stamped out, but it doesn't exist.
[02:29:08.979 --> 02:29:09.780]  Again, contradiction.
[02:29:10.459 --> 02:29:12.320]  And I have to remind you, too, a little side note.
[02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:23.227]  If you heard Alex in the first hour covering Sam Harris, if you search my channel on YouTube, you'll notice I've done about five, six deconstructions of Sam Harris's worldview, his pseudo philosophy.
[02:29:23.788 --> 02:29:27.890]  He passes himself off as this, you know, intellectual dark web philosopher.
[02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:28.771]  He's actually a sood.
[02:29:30.398 --> 02:29:42.844]  As we say in Internet terminology, a pseudo is a pseudo-intellectual who passes himself off as someone with this great learning, a philosopher, an intellectual, but really he isn't even past some of the basic issues in philosophy.
[02:29:43.444 --> 02:29:51.028]  Other philosophers in debates famously have called out Sam Harris for really fundamental mistakes like the is-ought problem.
[02:29:51.408 --> 02:29:58.634]  That's something that multiple philosophers and debates have kind of made a goofus out of Sam Harris when he tries to explain this.
[02:29:59.054 --> 02:30:10.083]  The clips are pretty laughable and if you go to my channel you'll see me deconstructing all those Sam Harris clips from years ago where he fumbles and bumbles around this really basic level question and kind of makes an idiot of himself.
[02:30:10.123 --> 02:30:18.290]  But really what we see today is something that I've posited for a long time with Harris and other so-called new atheists in these figures that were more popular about 10 years ago.
[02:30:18.897 --> 02:30:22.158]  Is that these figures really are just organs of the establishment.
[02:30:22.178 --> 02:30:26.840]  They're not actually intellectual rebels that are edgy and challenging the system.
[02:30:27.400 --> 02:30:34.143]  They just say one or two things here and there that are kind of edgy, and then everything else is just following the establishment drivel 100%.
[02:30:35.541 --> 02:30:37.743]  And I think everybody's kind of catching on to that.
[02:30:37.783 --> 02:30:50.373]  Now, I was saying this, you know, 10, 15 years ago, critiquing Sam Harris and the new atheist, but people are beginning to catch on to this, that their pseudo-intellectual positions have really been deconstructed by serious philosophers for a long time.
[02:30:50.874 --> 02:30:56.078]  And in many, many debates, which are, you know, accessible on YouTube, people are starting to see, actually, these people are not really intellectuals.
[02:30:56.098 --> 02:30:56.899]  They're kind of ridiculous.
[02:30:57.740 --> 02:31:05.668]  And they get called out all the time, but the establishment props up these people, the dark web intellectuals, when they're not really that sophisticated.
[02:31:06.949 --> 02:31:14.996]  But Plato's Republic is another example, again, of this seminal idea of technocracy that would influence, as we said, even communist dictatorships, right?
[02:31:15.076 --> 02:31:19.940]  Pulling from this idea of a perfectly ideal utopian type of system.
[02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:22.642]  Now, Plato himself wasn't really a utopian.
[02:31:22.662 --> 02:31:27.887]  He didn't think that this perfect system would ever be fully instantiated, but he thought it was what we should shoot for.
[02:31:28.487 --> 02:31:43.074]   But today's technocrats really believe that when they get rid of most human beings, 80, 90, 95 percent, whatever it is, That then it will be possible because we can get rid of or pass the human weaknesses through the technocracy.
[02:31:43.134 --> 02:31:50.641]  So that's the secret that they think they've discovered that will bypass the human weaknesses which prevented the perfect republic in the past.
[02:31:50.701 --> 02:31:59.990]  But of course, again, it's all based on the notion that human beings are just meat sacks, programmable meat sack computers, and not beings endowed with personhood and free will.
[02:32:01.607 --> 02:32:02.787]  What's another of these top 10?
[02:32:03.027 --> 02:32:04.188]  Let's move on to the next one.
[02:32:04.228 --> 02:32:09.169]  Well, in line with a lot of these texts would be the figure of H.G.
[02:32:09.209 --> 02:32:09.449]  Wells.
[02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:12.130]  And I'm not going to go too far into this because you guys know we've covered this.
[02:32:12.450 --> 02:32:14.070]  I lectured through in the fourth hour.
[02:32:14.090 --> 02:32:16.471]  You can go find all those at VandubViddy if you search my name.
[02:32:17.151 --> 02:32:17.331]  H.G.
[02:32:17.351 --> 02:32:19.772]  Wells has two books, New World Order and The Open Conspiracy.
[02:32:20.912 --> 02:32:24.913]  And I'm putting this as number two because it's just the clearest, most lucid.
[02:32:25.114 --> 02:32:28.254]  I'm classing these two together as one book because they're really similar.
[02:32:29.175 --> 02:32:34.013]   These two books really lay out That this is an open conspiracy.
[02:32:34.093 --> 02:32:46.279]  It's not a conspiracy that was hidden, that we had to be quiet about, and you know, the normie mainline debunkers that are out there and the blue checkmark, the academics, they don't read these books.
[02:32:46.579 --> 02:32:47.859]  They don't know this stuff, right?
[02:32:48.300 --> 02:33:03.772]   They, in their ignorance, just laugh at this as if it's some fringe thing, yet If anybody was to study again at an international relations program at a high degree level, they would be introduced to these ideas and these texts, especially something like Tragedy and Hope, right?
[02:33:04.312 --> 02:33:07.796]  So they don't even know that they're making fun of the very things that their establishment has put out.
[02:33:07.896 --> 02:33:09.457]  That's how ignorant these people are.
[02:33:09.518 --> 02:33:09.898]  But H.G.
[02:33:09.918 --> 02:33:14.342]  Wells, of course, was a famous Freemason, famous pioneer of techniques of propaganda.
[02:33:14.402 --> 02:33:16.785]  He was the Edward Bernays before Edward Bernays.
[02:33:17.649 --> 02:33:30.793]  And literally writes books called The New World Order and says we're going to put into place an international, masonic, socialist dictatorship that brings about a scientism-based technocracy.
[02:33:31.454 --> 02:33:41.120]  And then in The Open Conspiracy, he says that we will use both Marxism, Socialism, Communism, Fascism, and Capitalism to achieve this end, because those are just systems that get us to the end goal.
[02:33:41.220 --> 02:33:43.081]  Who cares what the system itself?
[02:33:43.101 --> 02:33:43.902]  We're not idealists.
[02:33:43.922 --> 02:33:55.128]  We're pragmatists, he says, but the pragmatic goal is the New World Order, is the One World Socialist Technocratic Universal Basic Income Dictatorship around technology.
[02:33:55.288 --> 02:33:55.949]  That's what he says.
[02:33:55.989 --> 02:33:57.090]  That's what these two books are about, 100%.
[02:33:58.110 --> 02:33:58.770]  Clear as day.
[02:33:58.830 --> 02:33:59.430]  No question about it.
[02:33:59.450 --> 02:34:00.570]  He says everybody has to die.
[02:34:00.890 --> 02:34:02.071]  Everybody has to be tracked and traced.
[02:34:02.411 --> 02:34:02.951]  No private property.
[02:34:02.971 --> 02:34:03.451]  No family.
[02:34:03.611 --> 02:34:04.551]  Can't have families anymore.
[02:34:05.071 --> 02:34:06.111]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:06.131 --> 02:34:09.332]  We were just discussing a couple of the key texts from H.G.
[02:34:09.372 --> 02:34:27.655]  Wells, who was sort of part of that left liberal Fabian socialist side of the Royal Society, which was not really interested in the people and the people's rights, but was actually working towards this end goal of a mass depopulation agenda and the implementation eventually of a one world technocratic order.
[02:34:29.775 --> 02:34:39.759]  The next one that I would say is a key text that we have to know about is, again in the same circles of people like HG Wells, the brother of Aldous Huxley was Julian Huxley.
[02:34:40.119 --> 02:34:50.923]  Julian Huxley wrote The Philosophy of UNESCO, and this is a small text, it's a little sort of manifesto about the UN's cultural and educational arm of propaganda.
[02:34:51.423 --> 02:34:56.062]   And in that text, he says that democracy is something that is kind of a joke and is dead
[02:34:56.062 --> 02:34:58.583]  and we need to stop propping this up.
[02:34:58.583 --> 02:35:04.262]   It's time to move past these ideas and to, along with Plato, continue the tradition of
[02:35:04.262 --> 02:35:05.262]  eugenics.
[02:35:05.262 --> 02:35:08.743]  Eugenics is, of course, basically just means racial hygiene.
[02:35:09.464 --> 02:35:13.506]  And the way that modern technocrats, socialists, fascists, etc.
[02:35:13.826 --> 02:35:24.950]  adopted this system, including capitalists too, bankers, corporatists, is that it's no longer about a pure race or creating some Teutonic knighthood or something like that.
[02:35:25.050 --> 02:35:28.352]  It's more so now allied with the notion of transhumanism.
[02:35:28.812 --> 02:35:31.933]  And in fact, it's Julian Huxley himself who coined the term transhumanism.
[02:35:32.631 --> 02:35:41.196]  And so what he says in this text, this philosophy of UNESCO, is that evolution has led us to the necessity of mass depopulation.
[02:35:41.596 --> 02:35:43.777]  That's just 100% what we have to do.
[02:35:44.158 --> 02:35:48.900]  It's part of the natural order that we have to kill off different breeds and different species.
[02:35:49.461 --> 02:35:56.885]  So the argument runs, and if you know about the British elite, they were big fans, all the nobility really, of breeding, breeding science.
[02:35:56.945 --> 02:36:00.547]  The Galton's, the Darwin's, the Huxley's, etc.
[02:36:01.638 --> 02:36:16.728]  Their families were really into the science of breeding, and so they would apply these principles of the animal order to the human order, and they said, well, look, clearly we have to have this perfectly bred human species, and we'll do this by XYZ scientific experimentation.
[02:36:16.888 --> 02:36:31.438]  Now, eventually that became unpopular with Hitler's form of it, but the establishment never rejected this principle of breeding and mutating the human species into what they had as a final goal, an end goal, the Übermensch goal.
[02:36:32.479 --> 02:36:39.726]  And that has only been continued through the programs that the American deep state inherited from these people.
[02:36:40.167 --> 02:36:41.147]  It's no different plan.
[02:36:41.848 --> 02:36:48.074]  And the plan itself is not inherently bad to think about improving human life or extending human life.
[02:36:48.114 --> 02:36:49.155]  Nothing wrong with any of that.
[02:36:49.236 --> 02:36:50.637]  That's not what these goals are for.
[02:36:50.657 --> 02:36:52.379]  They're not humanitarian goals.
[02:36:52.978 --> 02:37:00.320]  They're goals on the part of the elite to have those powers and then to get rid of everyone else because they're social Darwinists.
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:02.080]  They understand they're not interested in helping you.
[02:37:02.100 --> 02:37:07.241]  Okay, the people who say they want to kill you, newsflash, don't want to help you.
[02:37:07.261 --> 02:37:22.656]   They want to get rid of you, but they want to use you as a lab experiment, as a test tube To figure out what works so that those technologies of life extension, and they believe in mortality, can be used for them and their descendants.
[02:37:22.756 --> 02:37:23.557]  That's the goal here.
[02:37:23.677 --> 02:37:24.838]  And this book talks about that.
[02:37:24.918 --> 02:37:27.841]  It talks about how eugenics kind of got unpopular.
[02:37:27.861 --> 02:37:33.325]  There's nothing wrong with those things, though, because it's just part of the natural evolutionary process.
[02:37:33.365 --> 02:37:35.467]  When you look at nature, you see predators and prey.
[02:37:36.188 --> 02:37:42.073]  So what's wrong with the economic predators, the economic elite, preying on everyone else and getting rid of them?
[02:37:42.865 --> 02:37:45.866]  It's no more wrong than a lion eating a gazelle.
[02:37:47.007 --> 02:37:48.867]  Which isn't wrong, it's just what happens, right?
[02:37:48.887 --> 02:37:49.727]  That's their worldview.
[02:37:50.068 --> 02:37:51.408]  That's the worldview of Sam Harris.
[02:37:51.808 --> 02:38:03.032]  Sam Harris does debates where he says, I can't believe that a God could exist where at the same time there's a child crying who dies in his mother's arms in childbirth.
[02:38:04.113 --> 02:38:06.253]  How could a moral God allow this to exist?
[02:38:06.293 --> 02:38:10.875]  But then he turns around and says, Trump is immoral for having a university that teaches real estate.
[02:38:12.228 --> 02:38:14.829]  But so the guy who says there's no morals, right?
[02:38:15.189 --> 02:38:16.269]  Well, he thinks there's morals.
[02:38:16.570 --> 02:38:24.752]  But of course, when he's questioned about this, he says, you can't, I don't know how we get morals from the fact that things just are, but they just are wrong.
[02:38:25.092 --> 02:38:26.173]  It's wrong because it's wrong.
[02:38:26.493 --> 02:38:27.713]  Well, that's a circular argument.
[02:38:27.773 --> 02:38:29.994]  We need a basis, a justification for why it's wrong.
[02:38:30.854 --> 02:38:33.535]  And most people today don't believe in objective morality.
[02:38:33.675 --> 02:38:40.628]   Now, Harris wants to try to have A secular foundation for objective morals, but that project always fails.
[02:38:41.048 --> 02:38:44.651]  If we're just meat sacks, it doesn't matter what we do, there's nothing right or wrong.
[02:38:45.091 --> 02:38:53.036]  If we're all just meat sacks, San Harris, then there's nothing wrong with economic fraudery and scandal, right?
[02:38:53.337 --> 02:38:56.239]  There's nothing wrong with Trump University doing whatever it did.
[02:38:56.259 --> 02:39:01.222]  And I'm not saying it did anything wrong, I'm just saying if it did do something wrong, there's nothing wrong with it, right?
[02:39:03.078 --> 02:39:11.121]  His basis, if Jeffrey Epstein did something immoral, which I think we all know he did, there's nothing actually wrong with it, right?
[02:39:11.481 --> 02:39:15.062]  The most that an atheist or materialist could say is that it's just not what they like.
[02:39:15.603 --> 02:39:20.564]  It's not my taste, right, to, you know, pimp out young girls or whatever.
[02:39:20.604 --> 02:39:21.805]  That's not according to my taste.
[02:39:22.699 --> 02:39:25.722]  But that's not the same thing as saying it's objectively wrong, right?
[02:39:25.762 --> 02:39:27.083]  So there's no normativity.
[02:39:27.103 --> 02:39:35.269]  There's no ability to get an ought, what you ought to do or ought not to do, from the fact that the atheist universe, the materialist universe, just is.
[02:39:35.489 --> 02:39:36.670]  It's just matter in motion.
[02:39:37.111 --> 02:39:40.433]  You can never get right or wrong from matter in motion.
[02:39:40.494 --> 02:39:41.995]  It's a very simple argument.
[02:39:42.535 --> 02:39:47.819]  And actually, he's been questioned on this many times, and he always flounders and fumbles around.
[02:39:47.839 --> 02:39:50.741]  In fact, the last time he was on with Jordan Peterson, he did the exact same thing.
[02:39:51.021 --> 02:39:59.227]  Jordan Peterson started bringing these issues up about how you can't get an op from Inez, and Sam Harris just sort of flumbles around in a circle and says, ah, well, maybe we can somehow one day.
[02:39:59.788 --> 02:40:01.549]  One day, science or something will give us this.
[02:40:03.405 --> 02:40:12.636]  But back to Julian Huxley, he says, again, riding the official philosophy of the United Nations, is that the goal here is that nation states have to go away.
[02:40:13.196 --> 02:40:16.760]  So you have to understand that they want to get rid of nation states.
[02:40:17.161 --> 02:40:24.109]  They want to get rid of all of them, not just America, not just Russia, all of them, because it's an internationalist plan.
[02:40:25.686 --> 02:40:28.572]  He says actually that building Babel is a great idea.
[02:40:28.592 --> 02:40:32.521]  We want the Babel that was in the Bible rebuilt.
[02:40:32.581 --> 02:40:33.062]  I'm not joking.
[02:40:33.082 --> 02:40:34.265]  He actually says build Babel.
[02:40:35.214 --> 02:40:46.120]  And he says things like the World Health Organization, these will be the organs and the fronts for depopulation and eugenics now that eugenics has a bad name, a bad image.
[02:40:46.160 --> 02:40:47.001]  We'll just rebrand.
[02:40:47.041 --> 02:40:47.801]  It's all just rebranded.
[02:40:47.821 --> 02:40:48.662]  Don't you understand?
[02:40:48.742 --> 02:40:49.202]  It's rebranded.
[02:40:49.222 --> 02:40:57.067]  Don't you understand that everybody who goes into high-level government organizations, they are initiated into the Kissinger depopulation type of plan?
[02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:59.591]  State Department Memorandum 200, right?
[02:40:59.772 --> 02:41:02.094]  All those memorandums that were the U.S.
[02:41:02.134 --> 02:41:05.276]  acceptance of dysgenics and depopulation.
[02:41:05.657 --> 02:41:07.878]  The Malthusian ethos has never gone away.
[02:41:07.898 --> 02:41:09.039]  It's just been rebranded.
[02:41:09.099 --> 02:41:11.501]  And all of the tech elite, they all believe it.
[02:41:11.922 --> 02:41:13.023]  And they all write papers on it.
[02:41:13.043 --> 02:41:19.288]  The next thing I'm going to go to is Bill Joy's essay on it, which Alex has talked about for 20 years, ever since it came out.
[02:41:19.348 --> 02:41:20.769]  I heard about this from Alex back in 2003.
[02:41:23.553 --> 02:41:35.179]  But he goes on to say that eugenics measures are necessary, but we're going to have to use psyops to trick people because nobody's going to accept it because of the bad image that Hitler gave to it.
[02:41:35.339 --> 02:41:36.740]  This is what he says in the book.
[02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:39.221]  I mean, this is a 50 to 60 page book that would tell you.
[02:41:40.002 --> 02:41:43.304]  The whole modus operandi of the UN is this.
[02:41:43.444 --> 02:41:44.384]  Don't you understand it?
[02:41:44.444 --> 02:41:45.585]  This is not up for debate.
[02:41:46.391 --> 02:41:48.552]  And anybody who goes into this system knows this.
[02:41:48.692 --> 02:41:55.615]  And the people who go into the system and then get questioned on it, they lie and say that it doesn't exist.
[02:41:56.175 --> 02:41:59.236]  Can't you tell when people are lying to you, when they're gaslighting you?
[02:41:59.596 --> 02:42:04.578]  The system, the establishment gaslights you every day because they say that this doesn't exist.
[02:42:04.638 --> 02:42:05.578]  Conspiracists!
[02:42:06.059 --> 02:42:06.859]  Which isn't even a word.
[02:42:07.839 --> 02:42:08.039]  Right?
[02:42:08.099 --> 02:42:09.039]  I mean, conspiracists?
[02:42:09.059 --> 02:42:09.780]  It's not a word.
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:23.323]  Summit of worldly wisdom is what I called this when I looked at the fact that Bill Joy, this tech elite guy back in 2000, he talks about all the years that he read through all the different religions and all the different philosophies, and why was he doing this?
[02:42:23.343 --> 02:42:32.805]  Why was Bill Joy, according to his essay, on this quest to read all the Buddhist texts, the Muslim texts, the Islamic, the Christian texts, all these different religious texts?
[02:42:32.845 --> 02:42:40.438]   Because he said, if we don't find an ethic To govern our technocratic order, it will be the death of the human species.
[02:42:41.658 --> 02:42:42.759]  Why the future doesn't need us.
[02:42:44.320 --> 02:42:49.924]  And did you hear Noah Yuval Harari the other day talking about why the future doesn't need us?
[02:42:50.284 --> 02:42:50.924]  That's what he said.
[02:42:50.944 --> 02:42:56.047]  I mean, I don't know if he was referencing this essay, but that's what this essay is about, right?
[02:42:56.067 --> 02:42:58.149]  That technology will replace humanity.
[02:42:58.169 --> 02:43:00.030]  We're entering into the post-human world.
[02:43:01.030 --> 02:43:13.860]  In the beginning of this essay, he talks about meeting with Ray Kurzweil and another philosopher, John Searle, famous philosopher, and how they were at one of these preeminent global elite meetings, a telecom conference, a big tech conference.
[02:43:14.861 --> 02:43:21.907]  And they were having this discussion and Kurzweil said that transhumanism is so certain that humans are done.
[02:43:22.547 --> 02:43:25.630]  There won't be humans anymore in the coming future, in the next 10, 15, 50, 100 years.
[02:43:25.650 --> 02:43:26.631]  We'll be something else.
[02:43:30.248 --> 02:43:42.254]  And then the discussion turned to how the elite discussed whether to just kill everybody or give them video games and trinkets to be happy and living in their coon pods.
[02:43:42.334 --> 02:43:44.075]  And the decision was made to get rid of everybody.
[02:43:44.255 --> 02:43:45.615]  So here you have it, clear as day.
[02:43:45.635 --> 02:43:46.596]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:43:46.616 --> 02:43:47.436]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:47.456 --> 02:43:49.197]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:43:49.917 --> 02:43:51.098]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:51.118 --> 02:43:53.519]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:43:53.579 --> 02:44:02.424]   I want to remind you guys, too, that it's crucial right now to support InfoWars, so head on over to the InfoWars store and get all those products that you absolutely need.
[02:44:02.464 --> 02:44:11.873]  This is the best way to support this flagship enterprise, which is at the tip of the spear, which is taking on the global elite.
[02:44:11.953 --> 02:44:20.642]  Klaus, Bill Gates, all these creepy characters literally fear a homemade organic operation that Alex started so many years ago.
[02:44:21.585 --> 02:44:25.088]  That has grown into this amazing tool for waking up so many people.
[02:44:25.768 --> 02:44:27.710]  And, you know, we don't need them for us to go away.
[02:44:27.750 --> 02:44:28.610]  We need it to be there.
[02:44:28.631 --> 02:44:30.432]  We need it to get bigger than it is.
[02:44:30.532 --> 02:44:35.055]  So go ahead and get over to the store right now and buy those products that I highly recommend.
[02:44:35.095 --> 02:44:40.580]  I've actually brought me bought many of these products over the years from InfoWars and I'm still loving the Coral Calcium Toothpaste.
[02:44:41.440 --> 02:44:44.302]  I bought many, many books and DVDs over the years from Alex.
[02:44:44.782 --> 02:44:48.323]  And I would say all of those have been beneficial for me.
[02:44:48.323 --> 02:44:51.501]   And I want to remind you guys too, that if you're in the Orlando area,
[02:44:51.501 --> 02:44:56.381]   September 3rd we'll be having another live event where you can come see me, my wife Jamie,
[02:44:56.381 --> 02:44:59.221]   we'll be doing an evening discussion, we'll be having debates,
[02:44:59.221 --> 02:45:03.382]   we'll be having discussions on geopolitics, the writings of the elite, philosophy, theology,
[02:45:03.382 --> 02:45:06.942]  all those things will be coming up at my Orlando event.
[02:45:06.942 --> 02:45:08.242]  That's September 3rd.
[02:45:08.242 --> 02:45:12.582]   You can go to my social media accounts at YouTube, Twitter, wherever, my website,
[02:45:12.582 --> 02:45:14.702]  and you'll see the links to this event.
[02:45:14.702 --> 02:45:16.983]  September 3rd from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.
[02:45:16.983 --> 02:45:21.822]   And at evening with me, there'll be some other guest scholars speaking as well.
[02:45:21.822 --> 02:45:23.382]  And it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[02:45:22.892 --> 02:45:29.415]  We had over 120, 125 people show up last month to the Nashville event and that was a blast.
[02:45:29.455 --> 02:45:30.415]  Everybody had a great time.
[02:45:30.855 --> 02:45:32.076]  So I want to encourage you to come out.
[02:45:32.116 --> 02:45:33.937]  There's only a limited number of 100 tickets.
[02:45:34.057 --> 02:45:36.278]  September 3rd in Orlando.
[02:45:36.438 --> 02:45:42.761]  The address and all that is available at the social media if you go to the top of my Twitter or wherever.
[02:45:43.647 --> 02:45:44.627]  You'll see that linked.
[02:45:44.808 --> 02:45:50.310]  Also, my new book is out if you want to get into philosophy, if you're interested in a lot of the topics that you hear me covering.
[02:45:50.750 --> 02:45:51.830]  I've got actually two new books.
[02:45:52.511 --> 02:45:57.173]  One of them was an accidental book, but the main new book is the book on philosophy and symbolism.
[02:45:57.193 --> 02:45:59.814]  Yeah, that's how you get the Orlando tickets there.
[02:46:00.534 --> 02:46:01.495]  Philosophy and Symbolism.
[02:46:01.915 --> 02:46:06.797]  In this, it's about 15 essays of my best dealing with Plato, dealing with all these topics.
[02:46:06.857 --> 02:46:08.437]  If you're new to that, you might like that book.
[02:46:08.497 --> 02:46:11.559]   It's a readable I have 200 pages or so.
[02:46:11.599 --> 02:46:13.119]  I think you get that on my website in the shop.
[02:46:13.139 --> 02:46:21.722]  And then I have a big fat 600-page book that's out, which is all the essays on philosophy and theology of the last 10 years collected into one big gigantic volume.
[02:46:22.422 --> 02:46:23.303]  It's called The Red Book.
[02:46:24.023 --> 02:46:30.285]  So, Mao had a red book, Carl Jung had a red book, and now I have a red book, but I think mine is better than those weirdos' red book.
[02:46:31.958 --> 02:46:32.619]  A couple more.
[02:46:32.639 --> 02:46:34.861]  I don't know if I'm going to get to all of the top ten.
[02:46:34.941 --> 02:46:36.422]  I did a video on my YouTube channel.
[02:46:36.442 --> 02:46:39.185]  You can go watch that if you want to for the full top ten.
[02:46:39.205 --> 02:46:44.149]  It looks like we're only going to get to be going through about five or six of these in the time I have left.
[02:46:45.410 --> 02:46:49.134]  But if you want the full video, it's at the top of my YouTube channel where I go through all ten of these.
[02:46:50.995 --> 02:47:00.213]   Most important text probably of all these that's the most revelatory is Klaus's book, Shaping The fourth industrial revolution, right?
[02:47:00.374 --> 02:47:03.963]  And in that text, Klaus really lays out a clear as day.
[02:47:05.018 --> 02:47:06.659]  Everything that we've talked about.
[02:47:06.739 --> 02:47:09.020]  I mean, he goes into goes into amazing.
[02:47:09.480 --> 02:47:19.824]  The full on plan is not just for where we are right now in the initial phases of the Great Reset, but where they want to take the Great Reset into 2040 into 2050.
[02:47:20.744 --> 02:47:32.129]  And it lines up with all of the other writings of the elite that we've covered over the last several years that covers basically a span of 100 years of elite writings going all the way back.
[02:47:33.799 --> 02:47:57.654]  To the turn of the century, the British Imperial Riders, Royal Institute for International Affairs, Chatham House, Pratt House, all of those writers and what they talked about, perfect continuity of agenda all the way up to Klaus's fourth Industrial Revolution, which actually came out in 2018, a little bit prior to the events of CUFID, the CUFID outbreak and how instrumental that was to their plan.
[02:47:59.062 --> 02:48:02.745]  And as you know, we've covered this book many times here on the Fourth Hour on InfoWars.
[02:48:03.145 --> 02:48:21.418]  What I really found surprising, what I didn't expect, was the sort of quasi-religious language that Klaus uses in the first half of the book, where he talks about a new covenant, a new narrative, which led to actually Klaus's newest book, I think it's the newest book, The Great Narrative, which I did just get in the mail the other day.
[02:48:22.190 --> 02:48:25.372]  So I'm actually amassing like a shelf of Klaus works.
[02:48:25.472 --> 02:48:32.856]  I'm gonna be like a, uh, like people are these nerds that go into Lord of the Rings and they're obsessed with, you know, uh, Frodo!
[02:48:33.036 --> 02:48:33.596]  Mr. Frodo!
[02:48:33.756 --> 02:48:34.276]  Mr. Frodo!
[02:48:34.437 --> 02:48:34.957]  Sam!
[02:48:35.197 --> 02:48:36.278]  I'm gonna be a Klaus nerd.
[02:48:36.298 --> 02:48:40.880]  I'm gonna have like all of it mapped out like a giant map, uh, like Tolkien's map of the Lord of the Rings.
[02:48:40.900 --> 02:48:45.342]  I'm gonna have Klaus's world order mapped out like Tolkien drew, you know, Mordor and everything.
[02:48:45.362 --> 02:48:46.383]  And it really is Mordor, right?
[02:48:46.403 --> 02:48:47.924]  I mean, Klaus really wants to bring in Mordor.
[02:48:48.744 --> 02:48:55.089]  There's an amazing parallel there, because look, the last section of the book is called, REFORMING THE PHYSICAL WORLD!
[02:48:55.329 --> 02:48:56.570]  WE WILL BE INCITED!
[02:48:58.572 --> 02:49:06.298]  It's amazing that they put this stuff out in the videos, and it all gets fact-checked and said that it's not true, even though the videos have them saying it.
[02:49:06.398 --> 02:49:07.779]  THIS IS OUT OF CONTEXT!
[02:49:07.919 --> 02:49:08.480]  FACT-CHECKED!
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:09.080]  NOT TRUE!
[02:49:09.100 --> 02:49:12.042]  I mean, he has... Right?
[02:49:12.303 --> 02:49:16.546]  He has... Prince Trolls on to talk about.
[02:49:17.845 --> 02:49:23.728]  All of the things that we talk about, and people say it's not true when they publicly say it.
[02:49:23.808 --> 02:49:28.930]  I mean, the level of doublethink is just, it never ceases to amaze me, the level of doublethink.
[02:49:29.390 --> 02:49:43.196]  In this last section of the book, as we know, Klaus goes on to talk about geoengineering, nanotech, robots will do the policing in the future, AI, predictive, algorithmic, crime prevention, minority report.
[02:49:44.102 --> 02:49:51.445]  It will be a sci-fi future, where, this is his sci-fi future, where AI will track and trace your carbon.
[02:49:51.886 --> 02:49:54.107]  Oh, it's gonna be so great for the planet, man.
[02:49:54.207 --> 02:49:59.689]  We won't be like, we won't be gnashing up Mammy Earth, man.
[02:49:59.709 --> 02:50:01.070]  No, this is to put an end to you.
[02:50:01.210 --> 02:50:01.810]  Don't you see?
[02:50:02.070 --> 02:50:02.811]  How dumb are you?
[02:50:02.911 --> 02:50:07.613]  This is an austerity agenda to destroy civilization.
[02:50:08.314 --> 02:50:11.456]  People get, I mean, I was watching Tucker the other day and it was great.
[02:50:11.476 --> 02:50:15.858]  He was, he was going into like, why are they doing the things that will destroy Western civilization?
[02:50:15.878 --> 02:50:16.918]  Because it's a plan.
[02:50:17.839 --> 02:50:26.143]  It's a plan to destroy the existing order and out of the Phoenix, out of the ashes to erect the new synthetic order.
[02:50:27.344 --> 02:50:30.265]  Nanotech synthetic organisms will take over.
[02:50:30.305 --> 02:50:33.927]  That's a whole chapter on nanotech synthetic organisms in Klaus's book.
[02:50:37.606 --> 02:50:38.907]  How do you not understand this?
[02:50:39.027 --> 02:50:40.327]  This isn't even a long book.
[02:50:40.628 --> 02:50:42.908]  It's like, what, 250 pages?
[02:50:44.789 --> 02:50:47.410]  Yeah, 230 pages, actually.
[02:50:47.470 --> 02:50:56.574]  And then the last few pages get into just all of the professors and degenerate university corporate people involved in the plant.
[02:50:56.474 --> 02:51:03.282]   So it's basically just pages and pages of him listing all all the people who were in on it right so
[02:51:03.282 --> 02:51:13.923]   acknowledgments acknowledgments of all the people involved in our world order
[02:51:12.372 --> 02:51:22.218]  So these are all the tech and professor dupes who have bought into this thinking that, like, they're going to get a seat at the table, right?
[02:51:22.739 --> 02:51:27.942]  That's the, you know, if you go back to one of the other books we didn't get to, which we've covered many times, you guys all know about it.
[02:51:27.982 --> 02:51:34.206]  Anglo-American Establishment by Dr. Kel Quigley, which is a great addendum to Trageo and Hope.
[02:51:35.214 --> 02:51:44.039]  In Anglo-American Establishment, he lists the people behind the conspiracy a hundred years ago, and he talks about it as a secret society, his terminology.
[02:51:44.559 --> 02:51:54.424]  And he says the inner core were the real conspirators, but they had an outer party, his terms, outer party of helpers.
[02:51:55.364 --> 02:51:56.265]  Who are the helpers?
[02:51:56.885 --> 02:52:07.201]   The thousand, two thousand, three thousand plus University professor dupes who think that they're part of planning the future and they're going to get a seat at the table.
[02:52:07.221 --> 02:52:09.162]  They're going to be part of the Knights of the Round Table.
[02:52:09.182 --> 02:52:09.902]  I'm going to have a seat.
[02:52:09.942 --> 02:52:11.242]  I'm going to have a power seat.
[02:52:11.682 --> 02:52:13.702]  I'm part of this because I'm going along with it.
[02:52:13.783 --> 02:52:14.163]  No, no, no.
[02:52:14.243 --> 02:52:15.283]  It's to kill you too.
[02:52:16.603 --> 02:52:25.305]  Unless you are a 0.001% zillionaire, bloodline family, you don't have part in this.
[02:52:26.625 --> 02:52:26.945]  Period.
[02:52:28.553 --> 02:52:31.554]  And you don't get a part in it because you go along with it.
[02:52:31.674 --> 02:52:35.415]  This is something Alex harps on all the time, and he's totally correct about this.
[02:52:37.816 --> 02:52:40.237]  And it's amazing, too, because it's a delusion.
[02:52:40.297 --> 02:52:41.637]  It's this weird delusion.
[02:52:41.697 --> 02:52:54.261]  And notice how people on the left and people, you know, the crazed people out there, the half of the population that has gone nuts, we can all see, those of us on our side who are kind of awake, fully awake, half awake, we can see these people's delusion.
[02:52:55.321 --> 02:53:09.409]   And the delusion is no different than the professors And all these universities and all these tech corporations that are in the delusion as well who think that they're going to get some kind of access to immortality technology.
[02:53:10.510 --> 02:53:12.412]  Number one, there is no immortality technology.
[02:53:12.792 --> 02:53:13.532]  That's a lie.
[02:53:14.133 --> 02:53:14.693]  It's a scam.
[02:53:15.274 --> 02:53:17.635]  The world runs on large-scale scams.
[02:53:18.296 --> 02:53:21.378]  And the people who are in on it know it's a scam.
[02:53:22.278 --> 02:53:28.683]  But they know that people will believe, because they're confidence men, as Herman Melville wrote about, they know that people will believe this nonsense.
[02:53:30.043 --> 02:53:30.283]  Right?
[02:53:31.583 --> 02:53:47.108]  So he ends this book literally talking about like a Johnny Mnemonic, Vanilla Sky, Lawnmower Man world, VR metaverse, where you will be able to flee your daily world troubles, live in your coom pod, and just die.
[02:53:47.488 --> 02:53:49.229]  Just freaking die in your coom pod.
[02:53:49.249 --> 02:53:49.609]  Please!
[02:53:50.478 --> 02:53:51.058]  That's what he said.
[02:53:51.379 --> 02:54:01.547]  So the end of the book is about the Matrix and you in the coon pod and you just sort of quietly, they'll go push the buttons to euthanize you in the coon pod.
[02:54:01.587 --> 02:54:01.947]  Thank you.
[02:54:02.287 --> 02:54:02.968]  You signed on.
[02:54:03.348 --> 02:54:06.350]  You will get an extra year of UBI credits.
[02:54:06.410 --> 02:54:12.035]  And then after that, for your extra UBI credit year, we'll push the euthanasia code and you go to sleep.
[02:54:12.675 --> 02:54:13.376]  Just drift off.
[02:54:13.736 --> 02:54:13.896]  Right?
[02:54:13.936 --> 02:54:14.557]  Soylent Green.
[02:54:15.577 --> 02:54:17.579]  Soylent Green is made for people!
[02:54:18.419 --> 02:54:21.901]  If you've watched that, then you know this is the reality that they plan.
[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:35.159]  This is Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:54:36.151 --> 02:54:38.392]  Why don't more people stand up for freedom?
[02:54:39.053 --> 02:54:42.015]  Why don't more people fight the globalists and their tyranny?
[02:54:42.695 --> 02:54:46.918]  And the answer is, when you fight them, they come after you.
[02:54:48.513 --> 02:54:50.774]  And the enemies of freedom have come after Infowars.
[02:54:50.794 --> 02:54:51.675]  They've come after us.
[02:54:51.975 --> 02:54:54.476]  They're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:54:54.776 --> 02:54:58.558]  And they're on national television saying we want to shut Alex Jones down.
[02:54:59.098 --> 02:55:01.500]  Because they see us as populist, which we are.
[02:55:01.900 --> 02:55:07.403]  They see us as the archetypal example of people that aren't bowing to them.
[02:55:08.183 --> 02:55:12.267]  I don't care if you're black, white, old, young, or where you came from in America or anywhere else in the world.
[02:55:13.008 --> 02:55:25.861]  These globalists hate the general public and they hate men more than anything because men historically have been the ones during times of tyranny to rally to the evil and say no.
[02:55:26.874 --> 02:55:30.819]  And that's why they're coming after us with everything they've got.
[02:55:31.380 --> 02:55:33.723]  So when you ask, why doesn't somebody stand up against this evil?
[02:55:34.284 --> 02:55:36.747]  The answer is because most people don't want to take the attacks.
[02:55:37.468 --> 02:55:43.457]  But now it's become clear that submitting to the attacks is way more dangerous and way more sickening.
[02:55:44.741 --> 02:55:45.762]  Than fighting them.
[02:55:46.503 --> 02:55:50.666]  Going along with slavery, especially during the endgame, is worse than death.
[02:55:51.547 --> 02:55:57.772]  It was Zapata, the great Mexican revolutionary that said, it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees as slaves.
[02:55:58.113 --> 02:55:59.114]  But I want to go one further.
[02:55:59.694 --> 02:56:03.958]  You actually die on your knees, you live on your feet!
[02:56:04.913 --> 02:56:09.797]  I'm not fighting these people because it's some lost cause and it's just the right thing to do.
[02:56:10.017 --> 02:56:11.278]  I'd do that if it was the case.
[02:56:11.898 --> 02:56:18.103]  I'd do it because I believe in you and I know we can beat these people, but I need you to believe in yourself.
[02:56:18.803 --> 02:56:35.417]   So at this critical juncture, while the enemies of humanity are doing everything they can to try to silence you and your family, It is more important than ever that you spread the word about InfoWars and about the reports and the guests we have because they fear us for a good reason.
[02:56:35.478 --> 02:56:37.419]  We've got their number and we know how to beat them.
[02:56:38.473 --> 02:56:42.435]  Separately, we try to sell the best products we can because we want them to work.
[02:56:42.455 --> 02:56:43.276]  We want you to love them.
[02:56:43.296 --> 02:56:44.437]  We want you to come back and get them.
[02:56:44.717 --> 02:56:46.618]  They took our sponsors away more than a decade ago.
[02:56:47.298 --> 02:56:53.802]  And our flagship product that has funded so much of the great work we've done together, thanks to your support, is DNA Force+.
[02:56:54.582 --> 02:56:57.144]  It's got PQQ, CoQ10.
[02:56:57.644 --> 02:57:07.290]  It's got so many incredible products that you should go read about and discover for yourself that do amazing things for your body and your immune system and your DNA.
[02:57:08.519 --> 02:57:13.924]  It's finally in stock, and InfoWars is right on the edge of being in the red and the black during a bankruptcy.
[02:57:13.964 --> 02:57:21.270]  But if you support us and support the investment you've made over the years, you have my pledge that we'll never give in, we'll never surrender, but we could give out.

[02:58:04.219 --> 02:58:08.141]  You already know you're the tip of the spear because you are the supporters of this broadcast.
[02:58:08.621 --> 02:58:10.442]  You see how much InfoWars is hated.
[02:58:10.802 --> 02:58:14.784]  You see how much they're trying to shut us down because they're scared of you coalescing.
[02:58:15.024 --> 02:58:16.505]  They're scared of you coming together.
[02:58:16.525 --> 02:58:24.368]  They're scared of you supporting freedom and justice because they know it's so popular that if the free market of ideas is allowed, it's over for the New World Order.
[02:58:24.749 --> 02:58:25.789]  DNA Force Plus.
[02:58:25.869 --> 02:58:27.130]  Back in stock.
