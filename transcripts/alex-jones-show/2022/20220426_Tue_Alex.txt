[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.211]  Folks are really starting to wake up to the fact that the New World Order is a doomsday cult.
[00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:14.095]  And that they are actually initiating a controlled doomsday because they believe a collapse is coming so they want to have a controlled collapse so it can be controlled.
[00:00:14.515 --> 00:00:16.136]  And that's the entire New World Order plan.
[00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:23.951]  And then they will enjoy the fruits of the earth, the advanced technology, the life extension, the cybernetics, all of it, in their own words.
[00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:31.997]  I mean, I can play you all sorts of top loveless leaders from Bill Gates to Noah Harari to Klaus Schwab.
[00:00:33.687 --> 00:00:38.968]  Saying we're doing this, we're going to put chips in you, we're going to take over your free will, we're going to get rid of most of the humans.
[00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:43.049]  I can show you the Washington Post and the New York Times saying dictatorship's what we need.
[00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.890]  Bloomberg, Financial Times, dictatorship, depopulate.
[00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.950]  I mean, they're openly saying we're the bad guys.
[00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.011]  Censorship, devaluation of currencies, crime in the streets, defunding the police.
[00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:55.432]  This is the end of civilization.
[00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:56.712]  Done by increment.
[00:00:57.372 --> 00:00:59.454]  It's the Great Reset, the post-industrial world.
[00:00:59.474 --> 00:01:05.878]  If you wanted to know what the post-industrial world looks like, like in Hunger Games, why are all these old cities rotting?
[00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:10.281]  Nobody, you know, there with power or food, because that's actually a plan.
[00:01:10.702 --> 00:01:12.283]  They're actually implementing the Hunger Games.
[00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:17.507]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.412]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Tuesday, April 26, 2020.
[00:01:28.427 --> 00:01:37.954]  22.
[00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:37.954]  And we're going to be here live for the next four hours of the vaunted, dreaded by tyrants, broadcast of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:47.101]  And to say that we're embattled is to say the least, but so is America, and so are many free spirits and innocents like the children across this planet.
[00:01:48.444 --> 00:01:59.550]  We should thank God that those of us that are being persecuted as adults at least made it to be adults before the persecution happened so that we can be there and stand for the innocents and always remember that's our job and that's why we do this.
[00:02:03.572 --> 00:02:20.410]   We have reached a level of danger that is just completely unprecedented and if you look at how the frog in the pot works with the successive approximation or incrementalism as tyranny accelerates and expands and is not reversed.
[00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.153]  We become accustomed to it and then basically accept it.
[00:02:26.854 --> 00:02:35.621]  The Russian Foreign Minister came out in a national TV announcement, we have the video, it's coming up, and warned of imminent nuclear war.
[00:02:37.922 --> 00:02:49.505]   He said that Russia is at war with NATO and that there is now a real chance the conflict will turn nuclear Kremlin Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warrants.
[00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:52.385]  That's a pretty big deal, isn't it?
[00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:54.766]  Pretty big deal.
[00:02:55.686 --> 00:03:05.108]  Germany responded by reversing their ban on heavy weapons like tanks and helicopters, and is now going to ship those in with crews to train the Ukrainians.
[00:03:05.148 --> 00:03:09.269]  So direct war between NATO, the US, and Russia.
[00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:15.070]  And they of course brag to CIA and Green Berets and the Navy SEALs are all over there.
[00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:18.582]  And this is just absolutely accelerated.
[00:03:19.102 --> 00:03:24.444]  And it was our military working with George Soros that overthrew the Ukrainian government eight years ago.
[00:03:24.524 --> 00:03:27.625]  And Russia doesn't want regime change on its border.
[00:03:29.445 --> 00:03:37.228]  Say what you want about Vladimir Putin, the United States would not put up with anything close to this on our borders.
[00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:47.362]  Until now, we're putting up the total collapse of the borders and all the Chinese Communist takeover, but any sane nation would not do that.
[00:03:47.802 --> 00:03:50.544]  That is one of the stacks.
[00:03:52.265 --> 00:03:53.266]  We'll be covering next segment.
[00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.531]  And then I've got this incredible stack here.
[00:03:56.931 --> 00:04:05.175]  Mainstream news reports, scientists discover heart inflammation more prevalent among vaccinated than unvaccinated study finds.
[00:04:05.835 --> 00:04:11.958]  Also, new studies show that you're way more likely to get COVID if you've been vaccinated, and it's way more likely to be more intense, just like...
[00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:15.014]  We told you.
[00:04:15.955 --> 00:04:17.236]  Of course, they told her by the opposite.
[00:04:17.276 --> 00:04:25.440]  What's so key about this is we have the CDC's own document from October 2020 admitting all these things would indeed happen.
[00:04:26.101 --> 00:04:28.522]  Just an amazing stack of COVID-19 news.
[00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:30.543]  That's only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:30.623 --> 00:04:32.224]  Huge news on inflation.
[00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:39.709]  And then folks are really starting to wake up to the fact that the New World Order is a doomsday cult.
[00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:49.653]  And that they are actually initiating a controlled doomsday, because they believe a collapse is coming, so they want to have a controlled collapse, so it can be controlled.
[00:04:50.073 --> 00:04:51.773]  And that's the entire New World Order plan.
[00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:59.535]  And then they will enjoy the fruits of the earth, the advanced technology, the life extension, the cybernetics, all of it, in their own words.
[00:04:59.555 --> 00:05:07.577]  I mean, I can play you all sorts of top loveless leaders, from Bill Gates to Noah Harari to Klaus Schwab.
[00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:14.548]  Saying, we're doing this, we're going to put chips in you, we're going to take over your free will, we're going to get rid of most of the humans.
[00:05:15.468 --> 00:05:18.629]  I can show you the Washington Post and the New York Times saying, dictatorship's what we need.
[00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:22.470]  Bloomberg, Financial Times, dictatorship, depopulate.
[00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.510]  I mean, they're openly saying we're the bad guys.
[00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.591]  Censorship, devaluation of currencies, crime in the streets, defunding the police.
[00:05:29.611 --> 00:05:30.992]  This is the end of civilization.
[00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:32.292]  Done by increment.
[00:05:32.952 --> 00:05:35.034]  It's the Great Reset, the post-industrial world.
[00:05:35.054 --> 00:05:41.460]  If you wanted to know what the post-industrial world looks like, like in Hunger Games, why are all these old cities rotting?
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:45.764]  Nobody there with power or food, because that's actually a plan.
[00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:47.845]  They're actually implementing the Hunger Games.
[00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:49.006]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:05:50.047 --> 00:05:56.433]  We have a lot of beyond critical information to cover here today on this live Tuesday, April 26 broadcast.
[00:05:58.883 --> 00:06:09.436]  I am your embattled host, Alex Jones, very blessed and honored to be in this position, and very thankful for you backing us and keeping us in this position to fight on and never surrender.
[00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:16.284]  Alright, everybody obviously wants to celebrate and talk about Elon Musk taking over Twitter.
[00:06:18.223 --> 00:06:22.564]  And I mean, I like trending number two yesterday on Twitter, right under Elon Musk.
[00:06:22.624 --> 00:06:23.145]  That's nice.
[00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:28.226]  I like the millions of extra people that visit him, fullwords.com, from stuff like that to wake him up.
[00:06:28.326 --> 00:06:30.467]  But I'm not going to hold my breath.
[00:06:33.408 --> 00:06:38.169]  Trump has said he doesn't want to go back there because he's got true social, but he doesn't even update true social.
[00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:39.990]  And I want true social to be successful.
[00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:44.891]  But how the hell is Trump not going to go back to Twitter because he has true social?
[00:06:44.931 --> 00:06:46.912]  He should use Twitter to promote.
[00:06:48.086 --> 00:06:48.847]  Truth Social.
[00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:53.211]  See, it shows where Trump's got real missing links.
[00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:56.334]  He's real smart in ways, but also, he's like an idiot savant.
[00:06:58.556 --> 00:07:03.561]  And it's why he's so frustrating, because I know he's a good guy, but man, does he miss the boat sometimes.
[00:07:04.001 --> 00:07:06.003]  We have officially petitioned to be let back on.
[00:07:06.023 --> 00:07:09.947]  I guess Don Salazar did that last night, because he used to have my Twitter codes.
[00:07:11.044 --> 00:07:19.690]  I didn't really even authorize that, but I guess he heard me on air say I would like to be back on, be a big victory for free speech, and I'd like to promote the show, and obviously the Twitter account would explode.
[00:07:21.131 --> 00:07:24.153]  And I'm glad to hear that Tucker Carlson got reinstated.
[00:07:24.774 --> 00:07:26.315]  Boy, that's the first person that should be.
[00:07:26.355 --> 00:07:32.639]  Talk about balanced and reasonable and Americana and very populist, very classical liberal.
[00:07:32.659 --> 00:07:37.823]  I mean, that's why they hate him so much, because he's so smooth and so on target.
[00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:44.677]  But InfoWars, of course, has not been reinstated.
[00:07:45.841 --> 00:07:47.841]  And I don't know if it will be.
[00:07:47.841 --> 00:07:59.841]   I'm gonna go out to dinner tomorrow night with some folks very close to Twitter, Joe Rogan,
[00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:07.841]   and I'll get his opinion and view on this, but I know that I was shown by a very famous podcaster,
[00:08:07.841 --> 00:08:17.841]   I can't name any names, the text message, it was sent about a year ago of a former head of Twitter,
[00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:23.841]   at the time still the head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, saying he really wants to stop censorship and...
[00:08:24.525 --> 00:08:26.857]  That Alex Jones is always right.
[00:08:28.479 --> 00:08:38.927]  And I was sent the text messages and then later had a phone call with the talk show host and it wasn't even off the record but I wasn't going to show those on air and I'm not going to say who gave them to me but I was told Jack Dorsey was a listener.
[00:08:38.947 --> 00:08:43.731]  I was told that he really didn't want to censor me but was under pressure from the board and basically overridden.
[00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:47.074]  There was a coup at Twitter and I didn't believe it.
[00:08:47.114 --> 00:08:54.139]  I thought it was him trying to rope a dope and then I went and yelled and screamed at him at Congress and well I guess he quit holding out then and went ahead and banned me.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:03.220]   But it just shows that Well-known talk show host, we're talking to Jack Dorsey behind the scenes, and he's a listener and totally awake.
[00:09:04.661 --> 00:09:05.041]  So wow.
[00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:13.164]  And I was told that by a lot of very prominent people, and I didn't believe it until I saw the text message from another fellow podcaster who lives here in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:14.465]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:09:14.505 --> 00:09:24.569]  I think you can put two plus two equals whatever, but that is an exciting thing to know that behind the scenes that was not BS when Jack Dorsey said Alex Jones is always right.
[00:09:26.724 --> 00:09:27.484]  I'm not always right.
[00:09:27.504 --> 00:09:44.702]   I think it's fair to say Alex Jones was right, but he has now come out and commended Elon Musk for taking over 44 million dollars, double what it was worth, and I think Musk will probably deliver on reinstating everybody.
[00:09:45.322 --> 00:10:14.174]   And I don't care if it is a racist black group, or I don't care if it's David Duke, I don't care if it is Mary Poppins, anybody that's been kicked off of Twitter or anywhere else, we need to go back to Section 230 where if they're not doing illegal gambling, or they're not, and I'm not against gambling period, I'm just saying on those platforms they can have their rules, or illegal porn, or calling for violence, Then you shouldn't ban somebody under the federal law.
[00:10:15.055 --> 00:10:18.958]  Those big media outlets are public utilities.
[00:10:19.478 --> 00:10:28.446]  That's how they're given Section 230 immunity from people that do commit crimes over the utility.
[00:10:29.887 --> 00:10:31.288]  So they can't have it both ways.
[00:10:31.328 --> 00:10:42.315]   So I'm certainly glad to know that Jack Dorsey actually is a good guy and was basically forced out of Twitter because he was fighting The censorship.
[00:10:42.535 --> 00:10:44.577]  Plus he knew it would make the platform more popular.
[00:10:44.957 --> 00:10:46.458]  So that's really an important piece of news.
[00:10:46.938 --> 00:10:49.219]  We'll get more to it in the next hour.
[00:10:49.239 --> 00:10:51.641]  I've got a lot of clips, a lot of information on that subject.
[00:10:51.661 --> 00:11:08.010]  But I would really like to see Elon Musk continue on the track he's on, the trajectory he's on, because he's gone from being really good on some things and bad on others to just amazing, trailblazing, incredible on everything he basically does.
[00:11:09.175 --> 00:11:13.157]  And then he's got arguments out there like, I don't think we should make people take brain chips.
[00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.119]  But what if you're obese?
[00:11:15.259 --> 00:11:18.361]  Or what if you have Parkinson's?
[00:11:19.021 --> 00:11:20.362]  What if you have epilepsy?
[00:11:20.402 --> 00:11:22.943]  Well, I'm not a hypocrite.
[00:11:22.983 --> 00:11:30.168]  My uncle has got a more advanced, the first generation's Vegas nerve stimulator, but they've got one actually up.
[00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:36.573]   into the brain and it's just like out of a science fiction movie. He'll be sitting there
[00:11:36.573 --> 00:11:40.253]   when he starts having a seizure. He just feels I'll tell you it's a really beautiful day. Very
[00:11:40.253 --> 00:11:44.413]   nice day. Sounds like a robot when he's talking. I got to get video of it. It happens like you'll
[00:11:44.413 --> 00:11:47.933]   be with him about every 30 minutes to an hour. He starts to have a seizure. That's why he had
[00:11:47.933 --> 00:11:51.023]  to have it or he'd be dead. He's in a motorcycle accident.
[00:11:51.023 --> 00:11:52.652]  His brain was out on the ground.
[00:11:53.453 --> 00:12:02.172]   He's in a coma for six months. Broke 20 something bones but lived and the epilepsy got,
[00:12:02.172 --> 00:12:04.892]  the convulsions got worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:12:05.066 --> 00:12:12.033]  So you understand, I'm not liking Klaus Schwab saying, we need to make you take microchips to buy and sell and make you take inoculations.
[00:12:12.433 --> 00:12:18.318]  Musk is saying, if we can do medical things with people and chips, obviously that's where that's going to go.
[00:12:18.398 --> 00:12:19.059]  I'm not against it.
[00:12:19.499 --> 00:12:22.782]  But we know the globalists are going to try to make everybody do it.
[00:12:25.888 --> 00:12:31.173]  The jury's been out on Elon Musk, but I think it's starting to come in that he's a good guy.
[00:12:31.193 --> 00:12:39.840]  And I had some folks very close to Elon Musk reach out to me four years ago, and again two years ago, and I just didn't really respond.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:40.921]  I thought, this is BS.
[00:12:41.702 --> 00:12:46.186]  And then, I'll leave it at that, was reached out to about a year ago.
[00:12:47.407 --> 00:12:55.431]  I've been told that he's basically on board, that I met with some other big billionaires that are associated with him, and they basically relay the same information.
[00:12:55.491 --> 00:12:57.792]  So we've had some of those meetings recently.
[00:12:57.812 --> 00:12:59.773]  So I hope to get to meet Musk very, very soon.
[00:13:00.033 --> 00:13:01.834]  His factory's right down the street from me.
[00:13:02.454 --> 00:13:03.735]  And then Joe Rogan's just right over here.
[00:13:03.755 --> 00:13:07.577]  So it's kind of that trifecta, weird how the universe works like that.
[00:13:08.197 --> 00:13:10.198]  Now that's some of the interesting news on that front.
[00:13:10.218 --> 00:13:13.200]  I'm gonna talk more about it later and where that fight is going.
[00:13:14.545 --> 00:13:37.184]   But the first big thing we need to hit now is the Russia-Ukraine situation, which anybody that studies warfare and how warfare explodes and spirals out of control Would know that historically what has gone to full world war is now happening again where each side keeps escalating in the fight.
[00:13:37.724 --> 00:13:54.060]   Heavier weapons, more armies are pumped in, and then finally you're in all-out war between the NATO power and Russia and the foreign minister has already announced what the Pentagon admitted Weeks ago, which we told you about before the war even started officially, that U.S.
[00:13:54.120 --> 00:14:01.966]  forces, I mean tens of thousands of special operations troops, are in Poland and in Ukraine directing the attacks on the Russians.
[00:14:03.227 --> 00:14:15.035]  And so the Russian foreign minister, Lavrov, went public last night and said, we are at war with NATO, NATO is at war with us, and this is going to escalate very quickly into a nuclear war.
[00:14:16.365 --> 00:14:17.405]  You think that would be bigger news?
[00:14:17.445 --> 00:14:19.726]  It's in some newspapers, but it should be the top story everywhere.
[00:14:20.046 --> 00:14:20.907]  That's a big deal.
[00:14:21.307 --> 00:14:22.447]  So we've got that right there.
[00:14:22.507 --> 00:14:29.870]  So we have the silver lining of Twitter and Musk claiming he should start freeing it up and seeing some instant movement in that direction.
[00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:36.632]  So that's positive, but it's dwarfed by this dark star of war.
[00:14:37.753 --> 00:14:38.353]  We've got that.
[00:14:38.393 --> 00:14:44.055]  We've got major studies out confirming COVID-19 vaccines or gene therapy and attack the heart.
[00:14:44.975 --> 00:14:45.736]  We're gonna hit that.
[00:14:45.816 --> 00:14:47.458]  We've also got the inflation news.
[00:14:48.198 --> 00:14:50.380]  We have doomsday globalist environmental cult news.
[00:14:50.461 --> 00:14:53.343]  It's key to everything to understand the overarching system.
[00:14:53.824 --> 00:14:54.985]  We've got election news.
[00:14:55.285 --> 00:15:01.351]  We have got so much open border news, completely open border, and so much more today.
[00:15:01.832 --> 00:15:05.471]   This is going to be one Hell of a transmission.
[00:15:05.531 --> 00:15:09.154]  Remember the power you have and use it while you still can.
[00:15:09.835 --> 00:15:13.298]  Tell everybody about InfoWars.com forward slash show, ban.video.
[00:15:13.318 --> 00:15:17.902]  The site you can share right now that takes you to ban.video that isn't censored is BattlePlan.News.
[00:15:18.363 --> 00:15:19.804]  BattlePlan.News.
[00:15:21.245 --> 00:15:22.206]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:15:23.187 --> 00:15:30.954]  Now, if you're a new listener, you're probably thinking, well, most of what this guy's talking about, I know to be true.
[00:15:33.109 --> 00:15:36.351]  If you research deeply, you'll find almost everything I'm saying is accurate.
[00:15:36.371 --> 00:15:36.972]  I'm not perfect.
[00:15:37.852 --> 00:15:40.894]  But if you're a longtime listener, you're probably pretty horrified right now.
[00:15:42.756 --> 00:15:49.120]  Because you didn't just hear me predict exactly what's happening right now in 2014 in Russia.
[00:15:50.561 --> 00:15:52.642]  You heard me specifically say what would come next.
[00:15:53.823 --> 00:16:04.252]   You see, when you shift your mindset into a Luciferian worldview, I don't follow Lucifer.
[00:16:04.832 --> 00:16:05.713]  I don't worship Satan.
[00:16:08.035 --> 00:16:08.956]  But I know of the devil.
[00:16:11.518 --> 00:16:11.858]  Very well.
[00:16:16.683 --> 00:16:22.287]  When, as a general, you learn to get in the enemy's head and see what they see, you know what they're going to do.
[00:16:22.568 --> 00:16:27.692]  So as a human, you don't look at the world like the devil.
[00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:30.434]  And so none of it makes sense.
[00:16:31.374 --> 00:16:40.400]  But when you look at the world through the eyes of Satan, with the discernment God's given us, you know exactly what's going on.
[00:16:41.361 --> 00:17:10.169]   To corrupt and make us decadent and evil and away from God, to then destroy all the checks and balances, to get everybody addicted to the global social credit score and universal basic income, to get the general population to become totally evil and anti-God, to reject God, And to do things so that they've committed the ultimate sin of rejecting the Holy Spirit and hurting children, so that they can be cut off from the transmission.
[00:17:10.608 --> 00:17:17.487]  It's transmission.
[00:17:17.487 --> 00:17:22.207]   So that then the planet can be destroyed and everyone killed.
[00:17:22.115 --> 00:17:26.434]   But it's pointless just to blow the planet up if he doesn't get the souls.
[00:17:26.434 --> 00:17:34.515]  So this isn't a game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:34.749 --> 00:17:35.570]  This isn't a joke.
[00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:37.670]  It's 100% real.
[00:17:40.251 --> 00:17:54.817]  Satan is an entity marooned on this planet, an alien, and is setting all this up to get us to turn against God, and then he blows the planet.
[00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:01.905]  And a lot of the initiates think they're about to merge the machines and become gods.
[00:18:02.425 --> 00:18:04.686]  That's the next to last ring.
[00:18:04.706 --> 00:18:08.927]  That's the penultimate ring on the pyramid believes they're going to ascend and be gods.
[00:18:10.728 --> 00:18:18.952]  The very few, I mean, there's probably not more than 100 of these people, are turned over completely to the spirit of destruction.
[00:18:19.812 --> 00:18:21.473]  And they aren't even human anymore.
[00:18:21.853 --> 00:18:26.013]  and they know they're here to blow the planet up.
[00:18:26.013 --> 00:18:39.912]   So, when you hear Harari at the Davos Group being clapped and standing ovations
[00:18:39.912 --> 00:18:42.753]   and people with tears in their eyes, when he says, "You have no free will,
[00:18:42.753 --> 00:18:44.753]  "we're taking you over, we're gonna get rid of all you,"
[00:18:44.753 --> 00:18:50.313]   everyone's clapping and laughing, that's the next to last ring on the pyramid.
[00:18:50.313 --> 00:18:54.233]  Not on the pyramid, but as in concentric rings.
[00:18:54.233 --> 00:19:04.233]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:18:56.109 --> 00:19:02.223]   But at the top of the pyramid, Is total extermination of everybody.
[00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:04.803]  Including people like Harari.
[00:19:04.823 --> 00:19:06.324]  I mean, look at that guy.
[00:19:06.884 --> 00:19:08.665]  Convincing himself he's a god.
[00:19:09.665 --> 00:19:12.466]  Convincing himself that he will become a god.
[00:19:15.006 --> 00:19:16.487]  Talking to another wannabe god.
[00:19:17.426 --> 00:19:19.426]  The...
[00:19:19.426 --> 00:19:21.426]  Aster heir.
[00:19:21.426 --> 00:19:29.426]  Anderson Cooper.
[00:19:30.171 --> 00:19:37.594]  Turned over as a child at age 8 by his mother to them.
[00:19:39.514 --> 00:19:52.054]   sacrificing her son on the altar of Lucifer. So you have to understand that's
[00:19:52.054 --> 00:19:55.394]  why they want nuclear war.
[00:19:55.066 --> 00:19:56.106]  That's why they want death.
[00:19:56.186 --> 00:20:05.209]  Bertrand Russell wanted nuclear war to wipe out most of the world population and then have an age of peace after the majority of us have been killed.
[00:20:06.128 --> 00:20:11.088]  He's hailed as a liberal.
[00:20:11.088 --> 00:20:19.128]  He's hailed as a humanitarian, just like Meryl Albright.
[00:20:19.853 --> 00:20:24.595]  Just like all these other mass murdering criminals like Zbigniew Brzezinski and Henry Kissinger.
[00:20:26.741 --> 00:20:28.344]  Look, we're going to have a break in about three or four minutes.
[00:20:28.424 --> 00:20:36.139]  I'm going to come back and I'm going to hit all the Russia news and all the rest of it in detail and I'll stop pontificating and preaching, but you need to understand how serious this is.
[00:20:35.979 --> 00:20:46.859]  You need to understand that your life is on the line here.
[00:20:46.974 --> 00:20:48.874]  I'm willing to be put in prison.
[00:20:48.894 --> 00:20:49.795]  I'm willing to be lied about.
[00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:50.615]  I'm willing to be attacked.
[00:20:50.635 --> 00:20:54.296]  I went to dinner with Roger Stone last night and people screamed at us.
[00:20:54.376 --> 00:20:57.538]  Most people were shaking their hands, but people followed us out and screamed at us when we left.
[00:20:58.278 --> 00:20:58.978]  The normal stuff.
[00:20:58.998 --> 00:20:59.858]  You're Russian traitors.
[00:20:59.878 --> 00:21:00.639]  You're going to prison.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.300]  We will continue the fight.
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.981]  I will continue the fight, but I can't do it.
[00:21:09.636 --> 00:21:12.378]  Without your financial support, and I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:21:12.899 --> 00:21:18.163]  Last week you helped dig us about, we did the numbers actually yesterday, about 40% out of the hole.
[00:21:18.183 --> 00:21:21.086]  I want to thank you all for coming through at InfoWrestler.com.
[00:21:21.807 --> 00:21:33.257]  But if I don't push hard again to get you to buy products that you need anyways, and ask for your help so I can help you, then we'll still continue to be deeper in the hole because we need to get out of it.
[00:21:34.571 --> 00:21:37.432]  You've seen the attacks, you've seen the censorship, the debunking, all of it.
[00:21:37.552 --> 00:21:50.037]  You have my pledge to spend everything I've got and everything I can do to stay on air as long as possible until we either mitigate the situation or the lights go out during the globalist cyber attack they're gearing up.
[00:21:50.697 --> 00:21:52.558]  But I'm going to continue on to the very last minute.
[00:21:52.578 --> 00:21:56.059]  That's my job, is to stay on board this ship and captain it.
[00:21:56.919 --> 00:21:58.380]  And I appreciate you helping me do that.
[00:22:00.846 --> 00:22:02.948]  We've got a lot of great products that are back in stock.
[00:22:03.448 --> 00:22:05.590]  Survival Sylladex II has been sold out for months and months and months.
[00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:07.891]  It's the highest quality deep-earth crystal iodine.
[00:22:09.232 --> 00:22:13.515]  If you take it for two weeks or so on average, people feel incredible effects after about two weeks.
[00:22:13.595 --> 00:22:14.836]  It's just amazing.
[00:22:14.936 --> 00:22:16.677]  Most people are deficient in iodine.
[00:22:16.717 --> 00:22:19.019]  Most types of iodine are bound to other elements.
[00:22:19.079 --> 00:22:20.180]  You can't absorb it properly.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.381]  This is truly atomic.
[00:22:21.401 --> 00:22:23.302]  It's the only true atomic iodine out there that we know of.
[00:22:23.322 --> 00:22:24.983]  A lot of folks call it atomic iodine.
[00:22:25.003 --> 00:22:25.444]  It's not.
[00:22:26.544 --> 00:22:29.445]  It is an essential mineral that supports thyroid health and well-being in the body.
[00:22:29.505 --> 00:22:33.967]  Nascent iodine supports iodine levels to supercharge cognitive functions.
[00:22:34.487 --> 00:22:37.769]  Nascent iodine might support healthy hormone levels to stabilize your vitality.
[00:22:38.109 --> 00:22:43.111]  Nascent iodine is involved in maintaining a healthy metabolic system to keep you going as long as necessary.
[00:22:43.531 --> 00:22:53.195]  Supplementing with pure nascent iodine also may help your body reach optimal iodine levels so you don't have to reach it from impure sources like bromine, bromide, chlorine, and others.
[00:22:53.515 --> 00:22:55.476]  If you don't have it, your body will use the toxic sources.
[00:22:57.608 --> 00:23:01.909]  Feel the relief and the strength of the next step of proprietary nascent iodine, Sir Robert Shull X2.
[00:23:02.349 --> 00:23:05.990]  Concentrated and free of unwanted additives and genetically modified ingredients.
[00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:13.872]  Available exclusively at InfoWarStore.com or by calling toll free, 888-253-3139.
[00:23:14.172 --> 00:23:16.072]  And a lot of you have made straight up donations.
[00:23:16.633 --> 00:23:17.953]  That is super awesome.
[00:23:18.373 --> 00:23:23.916]  Because if we bring in $20,000, $30,000 donations, we get all that money after the credit card fees, like 95%.
[00:23:24.197 --> 00:23:25.317]  And that's such a godsend.
[00:23:25.677 --> 00:23:27.438]  Front page of InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:23:28.439 --> 00:23:30.100]  $1, $10, $20, due recurring.
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:31.641]  Cancel any time for free.
[00:23:32.461 --> 00:23:33.222]  One-time donations.
[00:23:33.262 --> 00:23:33.782]  It's all there.
[00:23:33.902 --> 00:23:34.563]  Top of the page.
[00:23:34.963 --> 00:23:36.044]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:23:36.104 --> 00:23:41.027]  And I want to thank every single one of you out there that spread the word, that prayed for us, and or about the products.
[00:23:41.047 --> 00:23:41.687]  You know who you are.
[00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:42.988]  I salute you and I thank you.
[00:23:43.008 --> 00:23:46.206]   And I'm asking anybody on the bench, Are you praying for freedom?
[00:23:46.246 --> 00:23:47.367]  Are you praying for the broadcast?
[00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:48.287]  And are you buying the products?
[00:23:48.467 --> 00:23:49.168]  That's all I ask.
[00:23:49.408 --> 00:23:49.948]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:49.968 --> 00:23:50.409]  Stay with us.
[00:23:51.690 --> 00:24:04.178]  So when you see the leaders of the world and corporations trying to create degeneracy, crime, collapsing borders, debt, fentanyl, needles all over the ground.
[00:24:05.719 --> 00:24:11.904]  When you see them trying to sexualize children and engage in every crime imaginable while shipping weapons around the world.
[00:24:14.363 --> 00:24:16.664]  Why did Obama ship hundreds of thousands of guns to Mexico?
[00:24:17.724 --> 00:24:18.825]  To cause civil war and death!
[00:24:21.226 --> 00:24:28.229]  Knowing that only the criminals would have the guns, and then also having them shipped from Mexico to the Middle East to attack Syria.
[00:24:28.609 --> 00:24:30.270]  It's all declassified, all public now.
[00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:31.971]  Giant false flag operation.
[00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:34.692]  That's how criminal the Justice Department is.
[00:24:35.712 --> 00:24:36.833]  That's who runs our government.
[00:24:38.433 --> 00:24:39.634]  That's who's in control right now.
[00:24:41.963 --> 00:24:55.089]  And so when you think about how bad these people are, and you ask why world leaders go out of their way around the world to act the same, they're sent to the same global corporate schools, and they're paid off to follow orders.
[00:24:55.969 --> 00:24:58.870]  They don't even know why most of this is happening, they just follow orders.
[00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:01.591]  And Obama's higher level, he knows what's going on.
[00:25:03.212 --> 00:25:07.954]  But when you pull back and know the big picture, it is post-industrial world.
[00:25:09.946 --> 00:25:12.448]  What does the Extinction Rebellion do?
[00:25:13.328 --> 00:25:16.290]  Funded by the big banks all over Europe and the U.S.
[00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:17.170]  and the U.K.
[00:25:17.651 --> 00:25:18.731]  They go block trains.
[00:25:18.771 --> 00:25:19.812]  They go block highways.
[00:25:20.653 --> 00:25:25.696]  Their more secretive arms do even more intense sabotage.
[00:25:25.736 --> 00:25:28.498]  And the Animal Liberation Front burning down ski resorts.
[00:25:30.439 --> 00:25:32.840]  They are sabotaging civilization.
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.123]  Setting themselves on fire in front of the Supreme Court.
[00:25:39.608 --> 00:25:43.611]  And when you get into their mindset, they're a doomsday cult.
[00:25:44.111 --> 00:25:45.512]  They really believe the Earth's dying.
[00:25:45.853 --> 00:25:56.140]  They really believe it's their job to kill people, and they get off on the power and the mission and the excuse to be sociopathic and evil, but even they don't get the full picture of where it's all leading them.
[00:25:58.742 --> 00:26:07.188]  What do you think wearing all the masks is, and putting masks on the children, and hyping up a vaccine that isn't a vaccine that actually kills people?
[00:26:08.249 --> 00:26:12.854]   It's The Extinction Rebellion.
[00:26:15.936 --> 00:26:25.861]  You know the group pushing the takedown of Marjorie Taylor Greene and funding it with tens of millions of dollars is called Free Speech Group.
[00:26:27.301 --> 00:26:27.982]  Free Speech PAC.
[00:26:28.942 --> 00:26:32.344]  And they want to take your right to vote for somebody which is one of the purest forms of speech.
[00:26:33.476 --> 00:26:39.462]  Because she there says they want to take your right to vote, and then they try to, at the most fundamental level, block a candidate you want.
[00:26:39.962 --> 00:26:50.132]  The ultimate form of election meddling is to bar a candidate who can stand for election, and then they call their group the free speech group.
[00:26:51.494 --> 00:26:52.655]  Just a little added goody.
[00:26:53.055 --> 00:26:54.597]  You see, it's like extinction rebellion.
[00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.701]  They want to extinct humans, so they call it Extinction Rebellion.
[00:27:00.102 --> 00:27:01.462]  They don't want to be extincted.
[00:27:02.302 --> 00:27:03.903]  They want to extinct you.
[00:27:06.724 --> 00:27:08.745]  So anything they tell you, it's the opposite.
[00:27:12.126 --> 00:27:20.869]  You know, they don't protest oil drilling in China, or in Africa, or by foreign companies, the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:27:21.469 --> 00:27:23.190]  They just protest Europe.
[00:27:24.417 --> 00:27:25.017]  And the U.S.
[00:27:25.077 --> 00:27:33.140]  drilling and Canada because the very elites that control North America control Saudi Arabia and China and everywhere else.
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:34.681]  They don't want competition.
[00:27:35.041 --> 00:27:40.843]  And America is a zone established and set up.
[00:27:40.863 --> 00:27:41.964]  You want to show Extinction Rebellion?
[00:27:42.904 --> 00:27:46.565]  Just type their name in and show them blocking trains and highways and causing huge wrecks.
[00:27:46.585 --> 00:27:47.826]  I mean, it's amazing stuff.
[00:27:47.985 --> 00:27:51.265]  and they go block working class neighborhoods.
[00:27:51.265 --> 00:28:06.704]   So it is the ultra-rich banks, the ultra-rich families that are funding all this.
[00:28:06.704 --> 00:28:16.704]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:28:08.143 --> 00:28:10.165]  And they know exactly what they're doing.
[00:28:10.205 --> 00:28:12.526]  And again, it's part of the destabilization.
[00:28:12.986 --> 00:28:19.350]  So at the low level, Extinction Rebellion blocks the trains and the highways and the factories and sabotages stuff.
[00:28:20.424 --> 00:28:31.294]  And then the other cutout groups burn down the food processing facilities, and the other cutout groups put big spikes in trees, so when you're cutting them with a chainsaw, it blows the chain off and hurts you or kills you.
[00:28:33.055 --> 00:28:40.822]  But up at the top, the presidents and prime ministers are cutting off the pipelines, cutting off the drilling permits, devaluing the currencies.
[00:28:41.282 --> 00:28:47.268]  Everything they're doing is to assault you and to destroy infrastructure and to start wars.
[00:28:51.584 --> 00:28:59.754]  Covid Zero, saying no one can ever have Covid when any cold virus says it's Covid, has elements of a doomsday cult, writes someone on Twitter.
[00:29:00.195 --> 00:29:07.243]  A doomsday cult is a new religious movement or cult that says the world's about to end according to these cults.
[00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:09.791]  There will be a catastrophe.
[00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:14.055]  The only way to be saved is by joining the group and by doing what it says.
[00:29:14.496 --> 00:29:15.957]  That's the environmental movement.
[00:29:16.357 --> 00:29:18.099]  That's what William Shatner's part of.
[00:29:18.479 --> 00:29:19.981]  That's what AOC's part of.
[00:29:20.301 --> 00:29:21.963]  That's what Beto O'Rourke is part of.
[00:29:22.463 --> 00:29:24.805]  That is who they are.
[00:29:25.006 --> 00:29:27.088]  A doomsday cult.
[00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:33.514]  A doomsday cult is a cult that believes in apocalypticism.
[00:29:35.891 --> 00:29:41.474]  Including both those that predict disaster and those that attempt to destroy the entire universe.
[00:29:46.257 --> 00:29:47.698]  This is a doomsday cult.
[00:29:49.819 --> 00:29:53.762]  Who were the Heaven's Gate people in the 90s?
[00:29:55.472 --> 00:30:08.498]  They were a group of men only, computer programmers in Silicon Valley, who had their penises and testicles cut off because they believed the aliens were telling them, you must not have testicles, you must be hermaphroditic.
[00:30:09.119 --> 00:30:22.385]  And they put on their black and white uniforms with Nike tennis shoes and drank vodka and barbiturates and all laid there and died to be beamed up to the spaceship they believed that was following the Hale-Bopp comet.
[00:30:24.266 --> 00:30:26.709]  Now, those people are obviously insane and out of their minds.
[00:30:28.091 --> 00:30:31.696]  But if you look at Silicon Valley, where like half the executives are transgender.
[00:30:32.745 --> 00:30:40.491]  And if you look at what they're pushing, and all the movies, and all the end-of-the-world stuff, and you realize they're getting you ready for the end of the world.
[00:30:40.751 --> 00:30:44.214]  It's the end of the world for you and their followers, not for them.
[00:30:44.354 --> 00:30:48.794]   they're apocalypticly telling you it's the end of the world so you buy into it
[00:30:48.794 --> 00:30:56.473]   and so you accept it and then they are the maestros they are the conductors
[00:30:56.473 --> 00:31:08.153]   that direct the symphony of annihilation and so now you know why they've sent
[00:31:08.153 --> 00:31:15.033]   tens of thousands of anti-tank anti-aircraft missiles into Ukraine
[00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:17.990]  Now you know why George Soros overthrew an elected government and started attacking the Russian border with U.S.
[00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.571]  Special Forces eight years ago.
[00:31:20.291 --> 00:31:22.873]  Now you know why Russia came in.
[00:31:23.173 --> 00:31:25.314]  Now you know why Russia says they're fighting to the end.
[00:31:25.974 --> 00:31:30.576]  Now you know why they're threatening nuclear war if they're forced to start being defeated.
[00:31:31.843 --> 00:31:33.204]  That's doctrinal by the U.S.
[00:31:33.244 --> 00:31:34.705]  and Russia have the same doctrine.
[00:31:35.385 --> 00:31:36.186]  That's the playbook.
[00:31:37.306 --> 00:31:39.568]  That will be considered a war crime by the U.S.
[00:31:39.608 --> 00:31:41.329]  or Russia if we nuke each other first.
[00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:49.434]  By the way, I only have a certain type of dream rarely, and I get very nauseous and upset after I have them.
[00:31:49.454 --> 00:31:53.857]  And they're not of things that are going to happen, but things that could happen.
[00:31:54.457 --> 00:31:55.978]  That's how I predicted 9-11 before it happened.
[00:31:58.612 --> 00:32:00.733]  I've been having very horrific nuclear war drinks.
[00:32:01.033 --> 00:32:14.797]  I think a lot of you probably have them as well, but these are very intense and they have this look like they're in Skip the Bleach film where it's just a certain look to these dreams.
[00:32:15.497 --> 00:32:18.858]  I've learned what they look like and let me tell you these aren't dreams.
[00:32:21.539 --> 00:32:22.379]  These aren't dreams.
[00:32:23.739 --> 00:32:25.140]  This is a potential future.
[00:32:26.735 --> 00:32:34.558]  And let me tell you, the actual destruction of the cities and the military bases looks a lot different than what you think it's going to look like.
[00:32:38.639 --> 00:32:42.641]  And there's a very good chance we're going to have a nuclear war.
[00:32:46.142 --> 00:33:04.642]   So, finally, All of you out there that want to get a seat at Satan's table, been licking your lips for destruction because you're so deep down scared of it and you worship at the black altar of evil, there's a good chance you're going to get to drink from that cup and you're going to cry for your mommy.
[00:33:06.122 --> 00:33:06.742]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:06.762 --> 00:33:07.182]  Stay with us.
[00:33:09.463 --> 00:33:10.543]  Global emergency.
[00:33:11.703 --> 00:33:14.744]  Russia says it's officially at war with NATO.
[00:33:15.765 --> 00:33:17.505]  Orange nuclear Armageddon imminent.
[00:33:21.019 --> 00:33:55.790]   As our borders collapse, as the value of our currency is annihilated, as the pedophiles come out of their dark rat holes, we are here, still, begging the public to reach out to God And ask for the Holy Spirit to come into us and drive the evil out of our own hearts and minds and souls so that we can be lights in the dark to save the innocents and save ourselves.
[00:33:59.812 --> 00:34:03.173]  Everything we witness now is only the beginning.
[00:34:06.610 --> 00:34:14.214]  It's the beginning of the end, which is the beginning of the new start.
[00:34:15.475 --> 00:34:16.996]  Will we survive is the question.
[00:34:18.897 --> 00:34:22.278]  The orchestrated collapse of civilization is here.
[00:34:23.339 --> 00:34:25.820]  We are now deep into the first phases of it.
[00:34:27.121 --> 00:34:31.121]  There is no reversal of the collapse.
[00:34:31.121 --> 00:34:40.121]  The only question is, how bad is it going to get?
[00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:50.121]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:34:41.496 --> 00:34:43.056]  I don't come up here and try to scare you.
[00:34:44.157 --> 00:34:47.778]  And I don't come up here and tell you these things if there isn't hope.
[00:34:49.339 --> 00:34:51.080]  But you better get right with God.
[00:34:52.741 --> 00:34:54.221]  You better get your head screwed on.
[00:34:55.742 --> 00:35:00.302]  and realize that petty BS doesn't matter.
[00:35:00.302 --> 00:35:11.022]  Here's Reuters.
[00:35:11.022 --> 00:35:21.022]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:35:13.010 --> 00:35:19.173]  Russian Foreign Minister says Russia will continue Ukraine war until the end, including the use of nuclear weapons.
[00:35:22.715 --> 00:35:28.418]  Russia is at war with NATO, and there is now a real chance the conflict will turn nuclear.
[00:35:28.478 --> 00:35:31.540]  Kremlin Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warns.
[00:35:33.941 --> 00:35:35.602]  Russia warns of nuclear war.
[00:35:37.978 --> 00:35:40.118]  Remember how the last German war went?
[00:35:39.958 --> 00:35:46.717]   of nuclear conflict with the West. In a major reversal after warning of nuclear
[00:35:46.717 --> 00:35:52.238]  war, Germany approves tanks for Ukraine.
[00:35:52.238 --> 00:35:58.836]   Germany to supply Ukraine with heavy weaponry. Remember how the last German war
[00:35:58.836 --> 00:36:12.396]   went? And then US Blinken, Secretary of State, says Russia is failing in its war
[00:36:12.396 --> 00:36:14.677]  aims.
[00:36:14.493 --> 00:36:27.533]   Ukraine succeeding Yeah, Satan succeeding right now
[00:36:27.533 --> 00:36:37.532]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:36:29.006 --> 00:36:32.226]  Taking the world closer to total annihilation.
[00:36:32.226 --> 00:36:45.225]   While Biden has been blocked at least for a week by a federal court saying he
[00:36:45.225 --> 00:36:49.986]   cannot remove the federal law, saying that you have to at least check people's
[00:36:49.986 --> 00:36:56.986]   IDs to see that they're not smuggling drugs or kidnap children or women, or
[00:36:56.986 --> 00:37:03.066]   they're not carrying illegal weapons, or they don't have a damn third-world
[00:37:03.066 --> 00:37:05.585]  disease.
[00:37:05.199 --> 00:37:08.140]  That by the way are exploding all over the United States.
[00:37:09.261 --> 00:37:14.503]  We have two crew members out right now who got third world diseases in the last week.
[00:37:16.404 --> 00:37:17.685]  Stuff you never heard of.
[00:37:17.705 --> 00:37:24.988]  And that's because we're being purposely collapsed.
[00:37:27.149 --> 00:37:29.711]  That's the doomsday cult.
[00:37:31.011 --> 00:37:31.952]  That's what they've set up.
[00:37:33.312 --> 00:37:34.273]  That's what they've done to us.
[00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:39.802]  And it's only going to get worse until we stop it.
[00:37:40.863 --> 00:37:42.944]  Until we take back our governments in reverse course.
[00:37:43.745 --> 00:37:50.709]  Until the bureaucrats and the corporate minions and everybody following illegal orders stop doing it.
[00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.271]  Look at these headlines.
[00:37:53.291 --> 00:37:58.334]  And again, I could do whole shows on China alone, how it's the model for the world.
[00:37:59.094 --> 00:38:01.296]  It was $33 million, then $50 million, then $100 million.
[00:38:04.585 --> 00:38:14.836]  400 million Chinese under lockdown, in some cases for a month, not allowed to leave their house, even though the damn virus burns itself out in 14 days.
[00:38:16.679 --> 00:38:17.700]  Why would China do that?
[00:38:18.641 --> 00:38:22.806]  To cut off the supply chain to the West and to prepare their public.
[00:38:23.976 --> 00:38:31.340]  Nationwide, for the collapse that's going to be everywhere else, they're going ahead again, like the globalists are preemptively committing the collapse.
[00:38:31.961 --> 00:38:46.709]  Well, at the beginning of that controlled collapse, communist-controlled countries are doing it first, so they've already gone through it, so they don't have hysteria and out-of-control behavior when it hits the rest of the world for real bioweapons that are going to get released.
[00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:48.510]  Very serious ones.
[00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:49.811]  Way worse than COVID.
[00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:54.530]  That was just a beta test.
[00:38:54.930 --> 00:39:01.729]  It was very real.
[00:39:01.729 --> 00:39:07.289]   China is doing a nationwide martial law drill, complete with robots giving orders on the
[00:39:07.289 --> 00:39:09.970]  streets and millions of people being drug away to camps.
[00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:11.969]  Bye!
[00:39:11.774 --> 00:39:12.794]  Why do you think they're doing that?
[00:39:13.554 --> 00:39:14.815]  Just as an exercise of power?
[00:39:15.195 --> 00:39:15.395]  No.
[00:39:16.075 --> 00:39:17.575]  Just to cut off resources in the West?
[00:39:17.755 --> 00:39:18.015]  No.
[00:39:20.076 --> 00:39:21.176]  That's all coming here.
[00:39:22.418 --> 00:39:33.182]  With the economic collapse of the plan to bring in the one world government and the single currency and the universal basic income where they control every facet of your life or you starve to death.
[00:39:35.823 --> 00:39:38.644]  Only a moral public could live like this.
[00:39:39.124 --> 00:39:43.246]  Only a stupid public that doesn't stand up for itself or its neighbors could live like this.
[00:39:43.586 --> 00:39:48.107]  The reason we have empathy is because we know what happens to somebody else could happen to us.
[00:39:50.368 --> 00:39:51.929]  But out the door went the empathy.
[00:39:52.947 --> 00:40:09.502]  And out the door went the love of the First Amendment, and out the door went the love of being self-sufficient, because people were born to not being self-sufficient, and in comes the nightmare of tyranny.
[00:40:10.863 --> 00:40:35.138]   So that's really why I've been so freaked out, is I knew this was coming, I read their battle plans, we accurately predicted it, but To now know that we are well into the plan to depopulate 90% of the world population within eight years and have all these world leaders all starry-eyed going, the cataclysm will soon begin, but it's for the earth, right?
[00:40:37.379 --> 00:40:38.539]  It's what we had to do.
[00:40:38.859 --> 00:40:41.800]  They're doing it right now.
[00:40:43.961 --> 00:40:49.823]  And I know that there are globalist operatives and corporate operatives and minions of the system tuned in right now.
[00:40:50.919 --> 00:40:56.742]  And they know in their gut, I'm telling the truth, and they know in their spine, this is serious.
[00:41:01.305 --> 00:41:03.767]  But they're not gonna stand up and do the right thing now.
[00:41:04.967 --> 00:41:05.648]  But they will.
[00:41:07.269 --> 00:41:09.090]  The only question is, will it be too late?
[00:41:12.472 --> 00:41:13.452]  Remember the footage in China?
[00:41:14.273 --> 00:41:15.754]  Where they make you get on your knees?
[00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.871]  For miles.
[00:41:17.911 --> 00:41:22.334]  And then they come and scan you into the FEMA camp in the emergency center.
[00:41:27.118 --> 00:41:29.880]  And they say, oh, we're trying to avoid lockdowns.
[00:41:29.900 --> 00:41:31.982]  We're trying to, oh, we had a COVID case.
[00:41:32.002 --> 00:41:33.083]  We had to lock the whole city down.
[00:41:33.423 --> 00:41:34.384]  And it doesn't even kill you.
[00:41:35.425 --> 00:41:36.566]  As they block therapeutics.
[00:41:41.246 --> 00:41:50.636]  I'm going to hit some of the geopolitical news, the economic news, the inflation news, and the Twitter news, and some of the good news as well, and a bunch of clips next hour.
[00:41:50.656 --> 00:41:58.544]  And we have a special guest joining us as well, who I'm really, really enamored of and the great work he's doing.
[00:41:58.564 --> 00:42:00.246]  I'll tell you about that guest right before they come on.
[00:42:01.809 --> 00:42:11.214]  But separately, do I need to tell you that it's a life-and-death situation, that you record this and share it, or that you share the links and tell people, damn it, you need to go see this information?
[00:42:11.654 --> 00:42:21.560]  Because everybody that hears this can see it's happening, but also deep down you have a survival instinct God gave you, and you know this is very real.
[00:42:22.714 --> 00:42:24.615]  So spread the word right now before we start the second hour.
[00:42:25.215 --> 00:42:26.756]  And separately, please keep us on air.
[00:42:26.896 --> 00:42:30.417]  Books, films, t-shirts, water filtration, air filtration, great supplements.
[00:42:30.797 --> 00:42:31.977]  Back in stock like X2.
[00:42:32.418 --> 00:42:33.438]  Deep Earth Crystal Iodine.
[00:42:33.578 --> 00:42:34.899]  So good for your whole body.
[00:42:35.399 --> 00:42:35.959]  So critical.
[00:42:35.999 --> 00:42:37.880]  That's why they try to take it out of everything so you don't have it.
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.220]  It's back in stock.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:39.580]  X2.

[00:42:46.303 --> 00:42:47.903]  Every day could be our last broadcast.
[00:42:48.384 --> 00:42:50.084]  Every day could be your last day on Earth.
[00:42:50.444 --> 00:42:51.705]  We're now in that zone.
[00:42:52.086 --> 00:43:01.086]   Stay with us [Music]
[00:43:02.086 --> 00:43:07.086]  [Music]
[00:43:07.086 --> 00:43:32.086]  [Music]
[00:43:32.086 --> 00:43:38.086]  [Music]
[00:43:38.086 --> 00:43:43.086]   The term "bread and circuses" comes from an ancient Roman poet
[00:43:43.086 --> 00:43:48.086]   describing how the people are governed, not by excellence in public service,
[00:43:48.086 --> 00:43:53.086]  but by food and distractions, like a herd of livestock.
[00:43:53.086 --> 00:43:55.666]  (upbeat music)
[00:43:54.526 --> 00:43:57.508]  Today's circuses can be found on Twitter.
[00:43:58.429 --> 00:44:01.892]  A reflection of the human herd's short attention span.
[00:44:02.853 --> 00:44:08.579]  Meaningless distractions to keep everyone calm while their food supply is being destroyed.
[00:44:09.796 --> 00:44:24.072]  While fools joke about Biden doing a horrible job, his administration is doing such an efficient job of destroying America that anyone running in 2024, if there is an election, will have to run on the Build Back Better platform.
[00:44:25.173 --> 00:44:28.855]  Starvation has been used as a weapon of mass destruction for years.
[00:44:29.695 --> 00:44:39.120]  In just a two-year period, Stalin's communist government murdered over 3 million people in Ukraine by simply pulling the strings of bureaucracy.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:40.341]  Sanctions.
[00:44:41.281 --> 00:44:49.567]  The Ethiopian counterinsurgency burned crops and food stores, airily bombed food markets, and restricted trade.
[00:44:50.188 --> 00:44:55.692]  They then began a resettlement plan that killed at least 80,000 people with further starvation.
[00:44:56.793 --> 00:44:57.233]  The U.S.
[00:44:57.253 --> 00:45:03.538]  State Department murdered over half a million women and children in Iraq with starvation by sanctions.
[00:45:05.066 --> 00:45:07.808]  And this is exactly what is happening in America today.
[00:45:08.288 --> 00:45:18.714]  The Biden administration's sanctions against Russia are only succeeding at killing more innocent people all over the world by dramatically cutting down the worldwide food supply.
[00:45:19.354 --> 00:45:30.200]  There is already a significant wheat, fuel and fertilizer shortage, which is obviously going to affect everything else, starting with fresh produce and livestock.
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:40.703]  But in order to completely collapse the food economy, they'll have to start destroying food packing plants as well, so that there is nothing left on the shelves for you to eat.
[00:45:41.084 --> 00:45:47.166]  There have been confirmed over a dozen disabling accidents at food plants in the last month.
[00:45:47.206 --> 00:45:47.726]  Over a dozen.
[00:45:49.205 --> 00:45:52.646]  Absolutely, and we're talking about some really significant plants.
[00:45:52.686 --> 00:45:58.028]  The Taylor Farms facility in Salinas, California was completely destroyed by a fire last week.
[00:45:58.068 --> 00:46:04.771]  We've had two major potato processing plants in Belfast, Maine and Warden, Washington that were completely gutted.
[00:46:05.171 --> 00:46:08.532]  Which is happening at a time where we already have a potato shortage globally.
[00:46:08.812 --> 00:46:11.633]  You were talking about the onion supply at that Rio Fresh.
[00:46:11.993 --> 00:46:13.713]  But it's not just produce plants.
[00:46:13.853 --> 00:46:27.857]  Last month there was a fire that took out a Nestle food plant out in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and that's impacting frozen food brands like Hot Pockets or Stouffer's, which maybe you might buy if you can't get fresh food from a warehouse that just exploded.
[00:46:28.909 --> 00:46:34.353]  Those still satiated with their bread and circuses are soon going to start getting hungry.
[00:46:34.773 --> 00:46:43.398]  And it's because America is under siege, being destroyed from within by a corrupt government while the people seek fairness on Twitter.
[00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:47.199]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Rees.
[00:46:47.199 --> 00:47:01.519]  [Intro]
[00:47:01.519 --> 00:47:02.019]  Me.
[00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:12.019]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:47:04.815 --> 00:47:05.416]  Obviously not.
[00:47:05.456 --> 00:47:05.976]  I don't think so.
[00:47:06.596 --> 00:47:09.058]  I think all of you already instinctively know this is the big one.
[00:47:10.139 --> 00:47:18.624]  And if we fail this test, we're going to be ruled by the threat of unending invisible bio weapons.
[00:47:19.725 --> 00:47:33.356]   I've told you for nine weeks that once they implement this, if we cower in fear properly and grovel, it will then become a permanent emergency by saying, We can't let one person die from this virus.
[00:47:35.721 --> 00:47:41.800]   And so until there's no death, zero, out of seven and a half billion people, it's impossible.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:51.239]   We are going to keep the social distancing and the lockdown in place.
[00:47:51.482 --> 00:47:54.303]  We're going to probably have to cycle this and throttle it.
[00:47:54.623 --> 00:47:57.064]  And, oh, you can't go out here, you can't go out there.
[00:47:57.084 --> 00:47:58.865]  They're going to have a county by county thing at first.
[00:47:59.385 --> 00:48:02.046]  And just getting us all trained that we can't go out until we're told.
[00:48:02.466 --> 00:48:04.987]  And that's the way it is to keep us safe from the virus.
[00:48:05.128 --> 00:48:15.524]   Obama and Dr. Faustus Fauci Are now the ones telling us the lockdown can never end.
[00:48:15.604 --> 00:48:18.206]  Remember, 15 days to bend the curve?
[00:48:19.806 --> 00:48:26.190]  And then when it wasn't even one-tenth of what they said it would be, they went, oh sorry, it's so devastating because it's not even one-tenth of what we said.
[00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:27.311]  It was just two years ago.
[00:48:27.751 --> 00:48:28.752]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:48:31.013 --> 00:48:37.557]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:48:40.157 --> 00:48:48.483]  Now the undisputed heart of the resistance, because of you the listeners and viewers and supporters and affiliates, I salute and thank you all.
[00:48:48.683 --> 00:48:50.644]  We are the resistance to Satan.
[00:48:51.385 --> 00:48:53.466]  We are the resistance to dehumanization.
[00:48:54.027 --> 00:48:56.649]  We are the resistance to pedophilia and war.
[00:48:57.609 --> 00:49:01.032]  And God is the energy force that fills our sails.
[00:49:01.692 --> 00:49:06.816]  With God and the initiative to take action, we are invincible.
[00:49:10.879 --> 00:49:15.702]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much again for joining us on this emergency broadcast.
[00:49:16.542 --> 00:49:25.587]  You put that headline up, live show feed today, Russia officially announces that they're at war with NATO and says that nuclear war could kick off any day.
[00:49:25.607 --> 00:49:31.190]  Global emergency, Russia says it's officially at war with NATO, warns nuclear Armageddon imminent.
[00:49:32.745 --> 00:49:41.028]  Meanwhile, the globalist transhumanist doomsday cult has pulled out all the stops in their plan to collapse human civilization.
[00:49:41.888 --> 00:49:42.988]  This is not a drill.
[00:49:43.148 --> 00:49:46.409]  This is humanity fighting for its very existence.
[00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:51.891]  Tune in and share this link.
[00:49:53.792 --> 00:49:54.092]  All right.
[00:49:55.572 --> 00:49:56.553]  Let's talk about Twitter.
[00:49:57.273 --> 00:49:58.474]  It's a lot bigger than Elon Musk.
[00:49:58.494 --> 00:50:46.321]   It's a lot bigger than you and I. It's all of us together and it's the fact that you've had a unified front of hundreds of tech companies working with the global deep state and the permanent state to suppress everyone and to try to Dominate and bully us into submission, and then if you get one of the companies, it's about the fifth or sixth largest of them, depending on how you slice it, to be owned by somebody that just says they're not gonna censor, and then you see headlines everywhere, Elon Musk works for Putin, even though he's at loggerheads with him, and
[00:50:48.044 --> 00:50:51.126]  Oh my God, you can't have rich people owning something they're going to censor.
[00:50:51.146 --> 00:51:00.570]  In one of the most amazing clips I've ever seen of inversion, an MSNBC analyst says, what do we do if rich people take control of all the social media?
[00:51:00.911 --> 00:51:04.232]  They'll be able to steal elections and gaslight everyone.
[00:51:04.613 --> 00:51:10.396]  And there they are on TV having a discussion about what they've been doing to us and fully aware of it.
[00:51:12.357 --> 00:51:14.977]   Simply Incredible.
[00:51:15.017 --> 00:51:15.858]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:51:15.878 --> 00:51:21.162]  But first, the Biden administration says they will take steps to combat misinformation on social media.
[00:51:21.482 --> 00:51:24.144]  That means anything they disagree with.
[00:51:24.504 --> 00:51:35.492]  So the government's saying, hey, we'll battle Elon Musk if he lets the evil Tucker Carlson or the wicked Alex Jones or the satanic Donald Trump on there or the J.K.
[00:51:35.552 --> 00:51:41.216]  Rowling or the Laura Loomer and just the list goes on and on of these thought criminals.
[00:51:44.161 --> 00:51:47.042]  Here is the Biden administration making their announcement.
[00:51:47.062 --> 00:51:52.923]  The Surgeon General has said that misinformation about COVID amounts to a public health crisis.
[00:51:53.423 --> 00:52:05.085]  I'm wondering, regardless of ownership, would the White House be interested in working with Twitter like it has in the past to continue to combat this kind of misinformation?
[00:52:05.265 --> 00:52:09.986]  Or are we in a different part of the pandemic where that kind of partnership is no longer necessary?
[00:52:10.445 --> 00:52:15.627]  Well, I think we engage regularly with all social media platforms about steps that can be taken.
[00:52:16.107 --> 00:52:18.048]  That has continued, and I'm sure it will continue.
[00:52:18.728 --> 00:52:36.995]  But there are also reforms that we think Congress could take, and we would support taking, including reforming Section 230, enacting antitrust reforms, requiring more transparency, and the President is encouraged by the bipartisan support for, or engagement, in those efforts.
[00:52:37.645 --> 00:52:38.806]  So let's decipher that.
[00:52:38.846 --> 00:52:49.555]  The Republicans sat on their hands, to put it lightly, with their thumbs in their rear, for the last six years while the Democrats in the deep state engaged in a reign of terror with the EU government advising how to censor.
[00:52:51.994 --> 00:52:55.518]  And the ADL saying arrest people that criticize anything the government says.
[00:52:55.818 --> 00:52:58.400]  Just serious authoritarianism on parade.
[00:52:59.181 --> 00:53:06.328]  And then Republicans kind of got their dander up a little bit to maybe do Section 230 or antitrust if they keep censoring.
[00:53:06.609 --> 00:53:12.655]  And then she spins it, oh it's bipartisan if Elon Musk doesn't censor, then we'll go after him.
[00:53:13.769 --> 00:53:15.169]  That's how that alchemy works.
[00:53:16.190 --> 00:53:24.812]  Here is Raggedy Ann saying, no matter who owns or runs Twitter, the president has been concerned about the power.
[00:53:25.512 --> 00:53:30.394]  Oh, they're so concerned about the power to ban a former president you stole an election from.
[00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:32.074]  The real president.
[00:53:32.954 --> 00:53:38.336]  You're so concerned about that power when it might not be totally in your hands.
[00:53:38.376 --> 00:53:38.716]  Here it is.
[00:53:40.154 --> 00:53:47.880]  Do you have a response to that, and does the White House have any concern that this new agreement might have President Trump back on the platform?
[00:53:48.281 --> 00:53:50.883]  Well, I'm not going to comment on a specific transaction.
[00:53:51.463 --> 00:54:08.677]   What I can tell you as a general matter, no matter who owns or runs Twitter, the President has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms, the power they have over our everyday lives, has long argued that tech platforms must be held accountable for the harms Now let's hear the same type of statement.
[00:54:08.497 --> 00:54:13.176]   supporter of fundamental reforms to achieve that goal including reforms to
[00:54:13.176 --> 00:54:18.217]   section 230 enacting antitrust reforms requiring more transparency and more and
[00:54:18.217 --> 00:54:23.856]   he's encouraged that there's bipartisan interest in Congress in terms of what
[00:54:23.856 --> 00:54:27.817]   hypothetical policies might happen I'm just not going to speak to that at this
[00:54:27.817 --> 00:54:32.657]   point in time. Now let's hear the same type of statement total inversion of
[00:54:32.657 --> 00:54:39.457]   reality playing something in reverse reading something in reverse MSNBC hack
[00:54:39.457 --> 00:54:43.297]   is suddenly worried about Twitter censorship influencing elections.
[00:54:43.297 --> 00:54:47.856]   Ari Melbourne with his tiny audience has crawled out from under a rock to tell us
[00:54:47.856 --> 00:54:53.137]   hundred thousand viewers or so that well I mean just just just share for yourself
[00:54:53.137 --> 00:54:57.497]   everything he says is what they've done with the election everything he says is
[00:54:57.497 --> 00:55:02.887]  them this is total projection in its purest form here it is.
[00:55:02.887 --> 00:55:06.667]   You own all of Twitter or Facebook or what have you you don't have to
[00:55:06.667 --> 00:55:08.014]   explain yourself You don't even have to be transparent.
[00:55:08.034 --> 00:55:22.858]  You could secretly ban one party's candidate or all of its candidates, all of its nominees, or you could just secretly turn down the reach of their stuff and turn up the reach of something else and the rest of us might not even find out about it till after the election.
[00:55:24.099 --> 00:55:32.621]  Elon Musk says this is all to help people because he is just a free speech, philosophically clear, open-minded helper.
[00:55:34.091 --> 00:55:37.453]  So Elon Musk might use this to steal elections.
[00:55:37.693 --> 00:55:40.155]  Elon Musk might use this to ban the other political party.
[00:55:40.355 --> 00:55:41.876]  They banned almost all the Republicans.
[00:55:42.396 --> 00:55:44.317]  MTG had her main account taken away.
[00:55:45.238 --> 00:55:51.261]  Oh, and they're publicly saying MTG shouldn't be able to run for office, but nobody's trying to stop people from running.
[00:55:52.682 --> 00:56:02.348]  This is like the most ridiculous level of gaslighting one could even imagine.
[00:56:04.073 --> 00:56:04.873]  But that's what they're doing.
[00:56:06.093 --> 00:56:06.974]  Oh my gosh!
[00:56:07.614 --> 00:56:11.735]  He wants to go back to Section 230 and only have moderators that ban illegal activity.
[00:56:11.755 --> 00:56:16.195]  Can you imagine the nightmare job at a company trying to ban everybody's speech and have AI do it?
[00:56:16.475 --> 00:56:17.596]  It's a nightmare, but they're on it.
[00:56:18.276 --> 00:56:22.017]  He's like, it'll be more profitable if we just ban illegal activity and go back to freedom.
[00:56:22.777 --> 00:56:24.697]  Plus it'll make everybody want to come back to the platform.
[00:56:25.557 --> 00:56:26.597]  Twitter's been in a lot of trouble.
[00:56:26.697 --> 00:56:27.438]  So's Facebook.
[00:56:27.498 --> 00:56:28.918]  So is Instagram.
[00:56:31.609 --> 00:56:38.052]  Apple, all of them are in big trouble after running off all of the productive people.
[00:56:38.852 --> 00:56:45.314]  Elon Musk as a businessman says, you know, that stock will double and triple and we can just make it a free country again.
[00:56:45.334 --> 00:56:47.375]  And these are digital nations.
[00:56:48.055 --> 00:56:49.395]  Facebook with three billion members.
[00:56:50.236 --> 00:56:52.597]  Twitter with over a billion and a half members or more.
[00:56:53.657 --> 00:56:54.457]  Apple with billions.
[00:56:54.977 --> 00:56:56.418]  Google with billions and billions.
[00:56:57.038 --> 00:56:58.899]  And they know that and they brag their nations.
[00:56:59.719 --> 00:57:10.036]  And they're training camps of how to get us to accept an unfree world in cyberspace so it can then be expressed and manifested in the third dimension.
[00:57:11.468 --> 00:57:29.352]  Which is the three show trials they have scheduled in Texas and Connecticut on me and Sandy Hook as the big mean man that was so mean because I questioned what happened because I had some anomalies and then all the exaggerations and lies about it and then HBO and Netflix all making movies about it so they can sit up there.
[00:57:29.372 --> 00:57:31.073]  I mean, can you imagine the Johnny Depp trials?
[00:57:31.113 --> 00:57:31.433]  Interesting.
[00:57:32.213 --> 00:57:34.355]  But can you imagine three Alex Jones trials?
[00:57:34.795 --> 00:57:38.318]  I mean, we're talking the Connecticut one, they want 12 weeks.
[00:57:38.458 --> 00:57:45.885]  In Texas, they want eight weeks of trials on TV, putting the First Amendment on trial, because who's the biggest devil?
[00:57:46.265 --> 00:57:49.108]  I didn't kill 500,000 children and brag about it like Madeleine Albright.
[00:57:49.368 --> 00:57:50.509]  I didn't lie about WMDs.
[00:57:50.889 --> 00:57:51.370]  No, no, no.
[00:57:51.450 --> 00:57:53.972]  I questioned a mass shooting, and I'm a populist.
[00:57:54.072 --> 00:57:54.752]  I've got to pay.
[00:57:56.714 --> 00:57:58.175]  Episode infinity.
[00:57:58.596 --> 00:58:02.748]   Staring into Eternity.
[00:58:04.449 --> 00:58:05.849]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:58:05.869 --> 00:58:07.910]  Very blessed to be here with you today.
[00:58:07.930 --> 00:58:15.452]  I intend to open the phones up throughout the rest of the shows this week, but we've got a big guest joining us next hour.
[00:58:15.492 --> 00:58:21.533]  I got a lot of news to hit, so we won't be taking calls today, but Owen Schroyer on The War Room always does, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:58:21.613 --> 00:58:24.434]  Central, and of course, Harrison Smith, 8 a.m.
[00:58:24.474 --> 00:58:25.114]  to 11 a.m.
[00:58:25.134 --> 00:58:29.756]  with the American Journal here on the vaunted InfoWars radio TV network.
[00:58:30.856 --> 00:58:35.705]   The people built For this very time we're in today.
[00:58:37.405 --> 00:58:40.967]  All right, I want to get back into this doomsday cult and how to stop them.
[00:58:42.327 --> 00:58:44.048]  I'm going to do that here in just a moment.
[00:58:44.868 --> 00:58:51.270]  But the biggest thing they fear is us building our own economies and creating our own systems.
[00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:54.632]  So you have the big woke corporate systems.
[00:58:54.652 --> 00:59:00.964]   Well, what about Truly awake corporations and companies that let you know they're pro-human and pro-liberty.
[00:59:01.284 --> 00:59:05.808]  That's where the whole future is going and that really scares the power structure.
[00:59:06.308 --> 00:59:12.053]  And I can tell you I've met with a lot of big people and some of the biggest publications and biggest franchises out there.
[00:59:13.714 --> 00:59:18.330]   I met with some last night and It did it with Roger Stone.
[00:59:19.371 --> 00:59:21.572]  And they all know that's where the people are.
[00:59:21.912 --> 00:59:23.512]  They all know that's where the future is.
[00:59:23.532 --> 00:59:24.913]  They all know that's where they want to be.
[00:59:25.413 --> 00:59:28.915]  And so that's why the power grab of the new world order is slipping through their fingers.
[00:59:28.975 --> 00:59:39.779]  But it takes money to win a war and it takes people supporting the culture and supporting the ideas that they know are accurate and true and that reflect who they are.
[00:59:41.141 --> 00:59:41.682]  So it's simple.
[00:59:42.623 --> 00:59:45.686]  If you don't support us at InfoWarsTour.com, I'm not complaining.
[00:59:45.726 --> 00:59:47.167]  Just share the articles, share the videos.
[00:59:47.648 --> 00:59:48.409]  That's free to do.
[00:59:48.469 --> 00:59:49.450]  At least you're getting the word out.
[00:59:50.211 --> 00:59:51.292]  And you know, pray for us.
[00:59:51.592 --> 00:59:52.153]  Pray for yourself.
[00:59:52.193 --> 00:59:52.813]  Pray for Awakening.
[00:59:53.374 --> 00:59:54.916]  But I'm telling you, we got products you need.
[00:59:56.013 --> 01:00:00.634]  So we've got this limited edition gold collectible InfoWars art piece.
[01:00:01.474 --> 01:00:02.994]  We've already sold out of a third of these.
[01:00:03.074 --> 01:00:03.795]  It will sell out.
[01:00:03.815 --> 01:00:05.995]  We'll never make these again.
[01:00:06.455 --> 01:00:10.076]  It's the Alex Jones exclusive InfoWars Republic Defense.
[01:00:10.136 --> 01:00:15.037]  It's a little gold bar with original art that I designed, and it's got a hologram on it.
[01:00:15.617 --> 01:00:18.817]  And again, you can get them up to 50% off, and you get three or more of them.
[01:00:19.178 --> 01:00:21.098]  But we need this as war bonds.
[01:00:21.658 --> 01:00:23.139]  We're not selling it as an investment.
[01:00:23.159 --> 01:00:24.600]  There's obviously a lot of markup in it.
[01:00:25.001 --> 01:00:28.103]  It's you have a memento and a piece of history to keep us on air.
[01:00:28.744 --> 01:00:32.086]  It's available right now exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:00:32.126 --> 01:00:33.167]  It's very, very popular.
[01:00:33.948 --> 01:00:47.918]  And again, the big mint and bank that owns this, the company that put out other versions of this, their own, sold one edition they had 300,000 of them for way more than we're selling the same amount of gold, but with different artwork.
[01:00:48.239 --> 01:00:54.790]   So it's a very Historic memento, and I want to thank you all for getting yours in at fullwarrestore.com.
[01:00:55.850 --> 01:00:56.731]  Also, it's back.
[01:00:56.811 --> 01:01:01.672]  Take your cellular function to the next level with Survival Shield X2, now back in stock.
[01:01:02.272 --> 01:01:07.514]  Iodine is an essential mineral, and this is the highest quality you're going to find for libido, stamina, your brain, electrochemical.
[01:01:09.384 --> 01:01:10.604]  The big one, of course, is immunity.
[01:01:11.105 --> 01:01:13.025]  Nothing is better than iodine.
[01:01:13.065 --> 01:01:13.805]  You've got to have it.
[01:01:14.185 --> 01:01:18.187]  And then finally, take your mental clarity to the next level.
[01:01:18.407 --> 01:01:23.528]  There's a lot of great nootropics, a lot of great brain pills, a lot of amazing stimulants out there that are natural and work really well.
[01:01:23.948 --> 01:01:27.349]  And our turbo force is super power nuclear, 10 hours clean energy.
[01:01:28.009 --> 01:01:31.310]  You got brain force plus, like four or five hours of really good, they're different formulas.
[01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:32.291]  So it's just different.
[01:01:32.311 --> 01:01:33.651]  It's like, well, do you like tea or coffee?
[01:01:34.171 --> 01:01:35.431]  Well, do you like chicken or beef?
[01:01:35.531 --> 01:01:36.532]  I mean, you know, do you like?
[01:01:37.432 --> 01:01:40.333]  This football team or that football team, they're different.
[01:01:40.773 --> 01:01:44.314]  This one hits really quick, and I like it because it wears off fast, so I can take it at night.
[01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:45.014]  I'm really tired.
[01:01:45.274 --> 01:01:46.395]  Last three hours on average.
[01:01:46.695 --> 01:01:47.835]  Hits really quick, and I'm done.
[01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:53.076]  We have Brain Force Ultra back in stock, 40% off in fullwarrestore.com.
[01:01:54.957 --> 01:02:00.538]  Now continuing here, ladies and gentlemen, into the news that we need to hit right now.
[01:02:00.758 --> 01:02:01.959]  Again, I want to thank you for the support.
[01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:10.212]  I had some billionaire benefactor that just paid for everything, we'd have no ads on here, and the broadcast would be better, but you'd actually be missing out on a lot of great products.
[01:02:10.252 --> 01:02:13.753]  So, in the end, the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:02:14.334 --> 01:02:24.617]  So I talked a lot about this earlier in the last hour, about the globalists being a suicidal, homicidal, doomsday cult.
[01:02:25.977 --> 01:02:27.398]  And the Nazis were a doomsday cult.
[01:02:28.106 --> 01:02:46.959]  There are many other doomsday cults throughout history, but when you look at Bill Gates, or you look at the Carney Endowment, these are doomsday cults, and the Democratic Party and Socialist and Communist worldwide say, the world's gonna end, there's too many people, the world's gonna collapse, while they carry out policies triggering a world collapse.
[01:02:47.259 --> 01:02:51.302]  So they can't win a war with armies and weapons against free humanity.
[01:02:51.562 --> 01:02:52.542]  We'd rally and say no.
[01:02:53.123 --> 01:02:57.826]  But if we don't know we're under attack, and we don't know who they are, we don't know what their endgame is, they will win.
[01:02:59.388 --> 01:03:00.449]  We talked about Doomsday Cult.
[01:03:01.030 --> 01:03:04.735]  Well, the Doomsday Cult controls the corporate media.
[01:03:05.996 --> 01:03:12.465]  And they are on every channel, every hour, you don't need me to tell you this, like a psychotic parrot.
[01:03:14.608 --> 01:03:15.349]  End of the world coming!
[01:03:15.469 --> 01:03:16.269]  End of the world coming!
[01:03:16.369 --> 01:03:17.010]  Humans bad!
[01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:17.830]  Humans caused it!
[01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:18.931]  Deadly viruses!
[01:03:19.031 --> 01:03:19.691]  Out of the jungles!
[01:03:21.212 --> 01:03:21.953]  Deadly viruses!
[01:03:22.313 --> 01:03:22.954]  Out of the jungles!
[01:03:23.254 --> 01:03:24.054]  Don't have children!
[01:03:24.074 --> 01:03:24.655]  They're bad!
[01:03:25.335 --> 01:03:26.456]  Everything's... No food!
[01:03:26.556 --> 01:03:27.677]  No food from COVID!
[01:03:27.717 --> 01:03:29.558]  No, no food from you locking everything down!
[01:03:31.439 --> 01:03:32.240]  Pipeline's bad!
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:33.100]  Pipeline's bad!
[01:03:34.941 --> 01:03:35.842]  Power plant's bad!
[01:03:37.443 --> 01:03:40.465]  They're tearing up hydroelectric dams!
[01:03:40.485 --> 01:03:41.426]  They're totally clean and good!
[01:03:43.968 --> 01:03:46.229]  It's the environmental eugenics death cult taking over.
[01:03:48.871 --> 01:03:53.273]  They mean business and they are empowered by the most rich, decadent, psychotic people on earth.
[01:03:54.053 --> 01:03:58.876]  And so when you see the parrot saying, Russia gonna launch cyber attack!
[01:03:59.256 --> 01:04:00.917]  Russia gonna launch cyber attack!
[01:04:01.717 --> 01:04:03.178]  Gonna make the power go out!
[01:04:03.478 --> 01:04:04.879]  Gonna make the power go out!
[01:04:07.896 --> 01:04:11.479]  You don't need to be a rocket scientist, do you, to know they pre-programmed everybody?
[01:04:11.979 --> 01:04:20.866]  I mean, before they went to cyber attack, I told you 26, 27 months later, it'll be war and cyber attack to cover up the economic collapse to bring in their global currency.
[01:04:21.126 --> 01:04:30.754]  Now, do you think I just looked into a big, giant crystal ball, and I... I do kind of do that occasionally, but that's not really what I do here.
[01:04:30.774 --> 01:04:32.035]  I do the crystal ball stuff when I'm asleep.
[01:04:33.322 --> 01:04:36.103]  But that's usually when I'm not doing the right thing, and it's so imminent.
[01:04:36.363 --> 01:04:38.404]  And God's like, Jones, have a big nightmare.
[01:04:38.865 --> 01:04:40.345]  See what's going to happen if you don't take action.
[01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:43.086]  And I've seen when I don't take action, what happens.
[01:04:43.106 --> 01:04:44.907]  I think you get those same dreams, folks.
[01:04:44.927 --> 01:04:45.988]  I'm not the only one, obviously.
[01:04:46.248 --> 01:04:46.948]  That's why you're here.
[01:04:47.849 --> 01:04:50.210]  And so the reason I knew it is...
[01:04:51.428 --> 01:05:03.059]  In all their white papers and their admissions, this is their plan to quote, save the earth from humans, is to artificially sabotage industrial society, so the carrying capacity of civilization can't take care of 7 million people.
[01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:04.760]  Comprende?
[01:05:05.281 --> 01:05:05.921]  Comprehend that?
[01:05:06.142 --> 01:05:06.782]  I think you do.
[01:05:07.543 --> 01:05:15.490]  So now it's gone from chirping and saying it constantly, to just a deafening crescendo of, end of the world, cyber attacks all over!
[01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:20.270]  Because you're waking up to them.
[01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:21.431]  You're saying no to them.
[01:05:21.611 --> 01:05:22.611]  You're not going along with them.
[01:05:22.931 --> 01:05:28.053]  They always had a plan to dumb us down and starve us and kill us, but now they're put in high gear because they're losing.
[01:05:28.813 --> 01:05:30.213]  And out comes the FBI.
[01:05:30.573 --> 01:05:35.855]  Warns of targeted cyber attacks on food plants after mysterious rash of fires.
[01:05:36.675 --> 01:05:39.736]  Climate activist dies after setting himself on fire outside U.S.
[01:05:39.776 --> 01:05:41.177]  Supreme Court on Earth Day.
[01:05:41.657 --> 01:05:42.977]  Climate activist, yes.
[01:05:44.338 --> 01:05:45.498]  Food shortage crisis.
[01:05:47.637 --> 01:05:49.999]  A plane just crashed in a major food processing plant.
[01:05:50.019 --> 01:05:52.902]  The world will run out of food, says the UN.
[01:05:53.382 --> 01:05:54.583]  All of it BS.
[01:05:55.464 --> 01:06:03.651]  America needs fewer fossil fools, the old globalists, and more fossil fuels that actually give life-giving gases off.
[01:06:03.972 --> 01:06:08.576]  And then Italy announces a rollout of a dystopian social credit system to conserve resources.
[01:06:08.656 --> 01:06:09.557]  Climate lockdowns!
[01:06:09.877 --> 01:06:11.579]  Told you two years ago those were coming!
[01:06:12.179 --> 01:06:15.280]  Why Gasem Newsom is creating a water energy disaster?
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:16.760]  Because it's their plan.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:18.361]  It's what they've been ordered to do.
[01:06:18.601 --> 01:06:19.281]  They're puppets.
[01:06:19.321 --> 01:06:20.521]  They don't run their own destiny.
[01:06:20.762 --> 01:06:21.682]  They're anti-human.
[01:06:21.862 --> 01:06:25.383]  They're pretending they'll be immune from all the horrible things they've done to us.
[01:06:26.123 --> 01:06:28.304]  We got big news in the economy and politics coming up.
[01:06:28.324 --> 01:06:28.784]  Stay with us.
[01:06:30.684 --> 01:06:32.725]  We are living in unprecedented times.
[01:06:33.725 --> 01:06:38.847]  And our weakness, the fact we were lulled into a trance by the media, has allowed this to happen.
[01:06:38.887 --> 01:06:45.135]   But I can tell you, I think you see it as well, you see the trajectory going back up now.
[01:06:45.895 --> 01:06:46.636]  We've hit bottom.
[01:06:48.056 --> 01:06:51.097]  But it takes a long time to turn a big ship around.
[01:06:51.637 --> 01:06:56.698]  All this other bad stuff, this momentum is still going that way, even though we're trying to turn it.
[01:06:56.738 --> 01:06:59.319]  It's going to take time.
[01:06:59.339 --> 01:07:01.579]  They're not going to kill everybody.
[01:07:01.599 --> 01:07:04.000]  We're not going to get away with this because why?
[01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:17.573]  The most important thing I say every day, because I could give you a thousand articles and incredible clips and entertaining stuff, but if you're not striking directly at the root, it's all for naught.
[01:07:18.293 --> 01:07:19.874]  A spiritual battle, good versus evil.
[01:07:21.274 --> 01:07:31.458]  If the public understands the globalist plan to pose as the saviors while they collapse the Earth's carrying capacity for humans, they will get away with it.
[01:07:32.666 --> 01:07:43.799]  If we expose the Davos Group and the New World Order and their own admissions, and the fact that they're orchestrating all this, and if we have the courage to admit how much trouble we're in, we will get out of it.
[01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:45.701]  Not unscathed, but out of it.
[01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:46.602]  Most of us.
[01:07:47.744 --> 01:07:51.461]   But the more you wait, I'm talking to new listeners.
[01:07:51.481 --> 01:07:52.381]  It's like the prodigal son.
[01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:53.962]  Let's just ask me all the time on the street.
[01:07:54.022 --> 01:07:56.363]  Why do you spend so much time talking to the enemy?
[01:07:56.423 --> 01:07:58.484]  Why do you spend so much time trying to wake up?
[01:07:58.524 --> 01:07:59.605]  Well, because I've seen it work.
[01:08:00.385 --> 01:08:02.787]  Most people serve the system because they're being opportunistic.
[01:08:02.807 --> 01:08:04.588]  They're trying to move up to the power structure.
[01:08:04.888 --> 01:08:06.729]  They're not thinking on a wide scale.
[01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:44.583]   But if they see the 35,000 foot view, if they understand that, then they have an Epiphany that it's only gonna get worse the more they submit and selling out is a lie and and they have a spiritual Vestigial point and an ancestral memory of Ancestors that were for good and people that struggled for freedom and and they they they begin to turn against the evil Because when you're involved in evil it's very seductive and it makes you think you're winning and
[01:08:45.393 --> 01:08:51.735]  But when you realize that you're being lied to, and you realize that you yourself are a fool, there's time to pull out.
[01:08:52.835 --> 01:08:53.815]  And none of us are perfect.
[01:08:55.016 --> 01:09:10.280]  You know, in this life we make mistakes, we have guilt, we feel bad for things we've done, and then the dark side comes in and says, well, go ahead then and just join with it, and don't worry about it, and don't feel bad about what you're doing.
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.380]  Be selfish.
[01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:31.934]  And being selfish may have worked the last hundred years, but now we're entering the point where being selfish means you're going to be all alone with an AI system that's imprisoned you through a social credit score where you've got to submit to everything it wants and everything it demands, and the demands will always become greater.
[01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:35.591]  What is the level of tyranny under which humanity will live?
[01:09:36.191 --> 01:09:52.795]  Thomas Jefferson was asked, and he said, the level at which you accept, because even if there's an evil leader, an evil group, once the corruption gets out of control, they'll be replaced with someone worse, and them with someone worse, until you go to pure destruction.
[01:09:54.136 --> 01:10:14.519]   That's how this works, and everybody can see the prosperity's draining away, and the insecurity's expanding, and the crime's exploding, and The quality of life is being evaporated before our eyes and that's because the Bible tells us the wages of sin are death.
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:31.712]  And just because pharisaical leaders, just because fake Christians get in the place of Christ and stand there and claim they represent God when they don't, don't look at them and those hypocrites and those cowards and then think that's the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:10:32.847 --> 01:10:33.367]  Because it's not.
[01:10:36.570 --> 01:11:11.383]   The Gospel of Jesus Christ, when you study it, is the key to everything happening, and you'll see all of it as inspired by the Creator, and as a vision, and a warning, and a cheat sheet, because God loves us, and God created entities that have free will, that have the potential in them of unlimited power, and the seed of the universe is Mahatma Gandhi said within them, But by giving you free will and creating new sentient independent beings, God had to allow evil to exist.
[01:11:16.125 --> 01:11:16.865]  Is that a crime?
[01:11:17.045 --> 01:11:17.265]  No.
[01:11:18.086 --> 01:11:18.606]  That's love.
[01:11:19.106 --> 01:11:19.626]  That's freedom.
[01:11:20.546 --> 01:11:21.667]  And God gives us freedom.
[01:11:21.707 --> 01:11:23.288]  Satan gives us enslavement and death.
[01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:25.808]  So let's hit some of these stories.
[01:11:25.848 --> 01:11:32.471]  And again, I have all these articles, but I want to go back to something yesterday that we covered when we played Club Sub, because it's just astounding.
[01:11:34.659 --> 01:11:50.526]  The head of the IMF saying we didn't know when we printed hundreds of quadrillions of different currencies that that would cause inflation and hyperinflation and a shortage of goods.
[01:11:51.627 --> 01:11:58.010]  That's like saying we didn't know if we poured gasoline all over ourselves and lit ourselves on fire that it might hurt us.
[01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:09.751]  That's like saying, if I put a worm on the end of a hook with a bunch of perch and bass swimming around in a dock, and I catch one, oh, I didn't know the fish would come get the bait.
[01:12:10.131 --> 01:12:11.012]  I didn't know this would happen.
[01:12:11.392 --> 01:12:12.533]  It's preposterous.
[01:12:13.093 --> 01:12:14.054]  But see, that's the paradox.
[01:12:14.074 --> 01:12:20.819]  They've got to do it to take control, destroy the old system to bring in something ten times worse, the cashless society control system, the market the beast.
[01:12:21.119 --> 01:12:25.522]  And so they've got to go, oh my gosh, we didn't know when we printed thousands of quadrillions.
[01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:28.545]  We didn't know when we gave ourselves unlimited money to buy everything up.
[01:12:28.865 --> 01:12:30.145]  And then handed over all the debt to you.
[01:12:30.406 --> 01:12:32.406]  We didn't know that was going to happen.
[01:12:32.606 --> 01:12:37.988]  What a ridiculous on its face lie.
[01:12:39.089 --> 01:12:44.891]  But see, if you believe the lie, you've now joined with the lie.
[01:12:46.152 --> 01:12:47.612]  Here's some photos for TV viewers.
[01:12:48.252 --> 01:12:54.855]  Kids playing with bricks made out of money during the hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic in 1923.
[01:12:55.655 --> 01:12:57.536]  By the end of it, you had to have a wheelbarrow of money.
[01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:04.203]  With thousand note Deutschmarks to buy a loaf of bread.
[01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:08.405]  When you went into a restaurant to order dinner, you'd pay up front.
[01:13:08.766 --> 01:13:12.528]  Because an hour when you were done, it might be 30, 40, 50% more.
[01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:21.554]  That's where we're going.
[01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:25.136]  Here's a nice larger photo of it for you.
[01:13:25.897 --> 01:13:28.959]  So you can see that for yourself and then go look it up for yourself.
[01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:35.817]  And then you've got the IMF director with the most asinine statement ever.
[01:13:37.439 --> 01:13:41.123]  We didn't think through the consequences of printing too much money.
[01:13:41.144 --> 01:13:43.106]  You know, you just did it to countless third world countries.
[01:13:43.126 --> 01:13:43.927]  You ordered to do it.
[01:13:44.614 --> 01:13:48.236]  You just admitted in white papers you were doing it to finally bankrupt the world and bring it into your system.
[01:13:48.676 --> 01:13:49.216]  Oh no!
[01:13:50.076 --> 01:13:50.697]  They didn't know.
[01:13:50.737 --> 01:13:53.738]  It's like having a fire chief that's been on the fire department 40 years.
[01:13:54.438 --> 01:13:58.860]  And you catch him with 50 gallons of gasoline pouring it all over the fire department.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:01.121]  And people pull up at night.
[01:14:01.661 --> 01:14:03.802]  The next fire chief, they go, Chief, what are you doing?
[01:14:04.382 --> 01:14:05.743]  And he's got a flamethrower in his hand.
[01:14:05.763 --> 01:14:07.604]  He goes, I didn't know what this would do.
[01:14:09.305 --> 01:14:09.905]  Sets it on fire.
[01:14:11.795 --> 01:14:15.197]  Is the fire chief gonna go to a mental institution or a prison cell?
[01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:15.637]  Yeah!
[01:14:16.818 --> 01:14:23.682]  Do you really believe the fire chief didn't know that if he poured 50 gallons of gasoline all over the fire station and then lit it on fire would burn it down?
[01:14:24.123 --> 01:14:28.765]  Do you really believe the IMF and World Bank didn't know that if they printed all this money what it would do?
[01:14:28.785 --> 01:14:32.908]  Do you think Idi Amin didn't know?
[01:14:33.108 --> 01:14:34.549]  Do you think Adolf Hitler?
[01:14:34.769 --> 01:14:37.591]  Do you think what they've done in Latin America?
[01:14:37.851 --> 01:14:41.153]  Do you think any of these people know?
[01:14:43.646 --> 01:14:48.690]  What they're part of when they do this.
[01:14:51.032 --> 01:14:57.357]  And of course, they knew exactly what they were doing the entire time.
[01:14:57.637 --> 01:14:59.919]  And you don't need me to tell you that.
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.322]  You know that's a lie.
[01:15:05.203 --> 01:15:13.778]   Again, it'd be like asking a famous football coach, who's the most famous Football coach, Madden?
[01:15:15.959 --> 01:15:20.722]  It'd be like Madden at his heyday, you know, with his video games and calling the NFL in the 90s.
[01:15:22.423 --> 01:15:24.284]  Lord knows I watched almost every game I could see.
[01:15:26.326 --> 01:15:29.968]  If you ask Madden, Mr. Madden, what is a first down?
[01:15:30.008 --> 01:15:31.269]  He said, I don't know what that is.
[01:15:32.270 --> 01:15:33.330]  Well, what's a fourth down?
[01:15:35.151 --> 01:15:35.892]  What's overtime?
[01:15:37.674 --> 01:15:38.555]  What's special teams?
[01:15:38.575 --> 01:15:39.456]  He goes, I don't know what that is.
[01:15:39.816 --> 01:15:42.499]  You have the IMF and World Bank saying they don't know.
[01:15:42.519 --> 01:15:46.002]  It'd be like asking a dentist, what's a root canal?
[01:15:46.022 --> 01:15:46.783]  I don't know what that is.
[01:15:47.123 --> 01:15:49.345]  Asking a police officer, what's a ticket?
[01:15:51.447 --> 01:15:52.969]  Asking a farmer, what's a seed?
[01:15:53.909 --> 01:15:56.232]  And they sit there and gaslight you with that?
[01:15:57.733 --> 01:15:59.014]  We have more news coming up straight ahead.
[01:15:59.054 --> 01:15:59.475]  We'll be back.
[01:15:59.635 --> 01:16:00.556]  Infowars.com.
[01:16:00.576 --> 01:16:01.397]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:16:01.637 --> 01:16:02.838]  Please stay with us and please spread the word.
[01:16:05.768 --> 01:16:11.350]  They look at you and your family and they want to kill you.
[01:16:15.211 --> 01:16:17.232]  How long are you going to wait until you realize that?
[01:16:19.352 --> 01:16:20.633]  How many of us have to die?
[01:16:23.154 --> 01:16:27.015]  What has to happen to you before you join humanity?
[01:16:30.609 --> 01:16:46.320]  We have a new special report that just broke dealing with what's in Rhode Island and it's funny, I was about to cover that and had no idea John Bowne just made it, just uploaded it to Bandai Video and they said he's got a report about Rhode Island and forced inoculation.
[01:16:47.361 --> 01:16:49.903]  Actual bill to make you take the shot, no ifs, ands, or buts.
[01:16:50.703 --> 01:16:54.926]  Which they've proven doesn't protect you, which they've proven gives you autoimmune disorders and blood clots.
[01:16:55.306 --> 01:16:55.767]  Incredible.
[01:16:57.642 --> 01:16:59.585]  Rhode Island infiltrated by communism.
[01:16:59.645 --> 01:17:01.368]  Hell, I wouldn't say infiltrated, I'd say taken over.
[01:17:01.408 --> 01:17:03.010]  But there's your headline, just went live.
[01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:04.392]  Here's some of the headlines right here.
[01:17:04.552 --> 01:17:10.622]  Scientists discover heart inflammation more prevalent among vaccinated than unvaccinated in a new major study.
[01:17:11.242 --> 01:17:13.065]  Let me actually show you the study.
[01:17:13.826 --> 01:17:21.530]  SARS-CoV-2 vaccination myocarditis in Nordic cohort study of 23 million residents in major nations.
[01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:23.170]  Go read it, it's lengthy.
[01:17:23.571 --> 01:17:32.295]  But we don't need to just believe that while we have the CDC fact sheet that they put on their website in October of 2020.
[01:17:32.335 --> 01:17:35.836]  Year and a half ago.
[01:17:38.298 --> 01:17:38.978]  Over a year and a half ago.
[01:17:40.862 --> 01:17:42.422]  And it says all the things it does.
[01:17:42.522 --> 01:17:43.243]  Oh my gosh.
[01:17:44.363 --> 01:17:49.964]  Heart attacks and myocarditis and Guillain-Barre syndrome and anaphylaxis.
[01:17:52.525 --> 01:17:55.346]  So much more.
[01:17:55.366 --> 01:18:07.669]  I'm gonna play a clip that's important where I predicted they would have endless lockdowns and claim all this and say that they wanted weather reports.
[01:18:10.148 --> 01:18:11.048]  Obviously not, I don't think so.
[01:18:10.887 --> 01:18:12.247]  I can just see them doing it.
[01:18:12.247 --> 01:18:15.408]   But how about the new viruses and how you got to be locked down here or locked down
[01:18:15.408 --> 01:18:16.408]  there?
[01:18:16.408 --> 01:18:21.806]   And sure enough, the CDC's new forecasting center aims to predict pandemics just like
[01:18:21.806 --> 01:18:24.847]  the weather.
[01:18:24.847 --> 01:18:30.287]   Here's a compilation of clips from 2020 where we predicted all of this and more.
[01:18:30.287 --> 01:18:31.287]  May.
[01:18:31.287 --> 01:18:32.287]  Obviously not.
[01:18:32.287 --> 01:18:35.007]  I don't think so.
[01:18:35.007 --> 01:18:38.807]   I think all of you already instinctively know this is the big one.
[01:18:38.807 --> 01:18:45.327]   And if we fail this test, we're going to be ruled by the threat of unending invisible
[01:18:45.327 --> 01:18:47.327]  bio weapons.
[01:18:48.294 --> 01:19:01.922]  I've told you for nine weeks that once they implement this, if we cower in fear properly and grovel, it will then become a permanent emergency by saying, we can't let one person die from this virus.
[01:19:04.503 --> 01:19:10.404]   And so, until there's no death, zero, Out of 7.5 billion people, it's impossible.
[01:19:10.404 --> 01:19:19.844]   We are going to keep the social distancing and the lockdown in place.
[01:19:20.069 --> 01:19:22.871]  We're going to probably have to cycle this and throttle it.
[01:19:23.191 --> 01:19:25.632]  And, oh, you can't go out here, you can't go out there.
[01:19:25.652 --> 01:19:27.432]  They're going to have a county by county thing at first.
[01:19:27.972 --> 01:19:30.614]  And just getting us all trained that we can't go out until we're told.
[01:19:31.034 --> 01:19:31.854]  And that's the way it is.
[01:19:32.094 --> 01:19:33.555]  To keep us safe from the virus.
[01:19:33.715 --> 01:19:44.107]   Obama and Dr. Faustus Fauci Are now the ones telling us the lockdown can never end.
[01:19:44.187 --> 01:19:46.787]  Remember, 15 days to bend the curve?
[01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:56.409]  And then when it wasn't even one-tenth of what they said it would be, they went, oh sorry, it's so devastating because it's not even one-tenth of what we said, we never reopen.
[01:19:57.809 --> 01:20:04.230]  And I go on to talk about the weather reports, and I'll be like, daily weather reports, and now it's all been announced.
[01:20:04.670 --> 01:20:14.524]   Look at this, US cases of child hepatitis Increases could be linked to COVID vaccines, say scientists and doctors.
[01:20:16.605 --> 01:20:22.108]  And boy, do the adverse reactions and reports come out from everywhere of the blood clots.
[01:20:22.929 --> 01:20:26.511]  Meanwhile, China censors viral video complaining about lockdown conditions.
[01:20:26.891 --> 01:20:27.751]  You're not allowed to do that.
[01:20:29.072 --> 01:20:32.994]  Small towns were the most people during the pandemic fleeing the cities.
[01:20:34.935 --> 01:20:37.897]  It's coming out in the news that Pfizer knew their vaccine would kill.
[01:20:39.258 --> 01:20:41.640]  Not vaccinated, have the least positive infections.
[01:20:42.882 --> 01:20:47.106]  You have to admit that this is rather interesting and the statistics are now out on that.
[01:20:47.446 --> 01:20:48.827]  Mainstream news all over the world.
[01:20:49.308 --> 01:20:50.289]  Less COVID infections.
[01:20:50.309 --> 01:20:58.276]  We haven't had the shots because the shots give you the COVID infections.
[01:20:59.277 --> 01:21:01.839]  But they just hope you don't go.
[01:21:03.502 --> 01:21:10.547]  Look all this information up, because then you would have the facts for yourself.
[01:21:11.108 --> 01:21:12.149]  And that leads me to this.
[01:21:12.269 --> 01:21:16.432]  Rhode Island Dems rush to mandate COVID jabs.
[01:21:19.827 --> 01:21:30.780]  The same states that want sanctuary cities, and to get rid of federal law, the illegal aliens are tested for any diseases, or even have their IDs checked, but oh, internally, you're going to be controlled.
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.942]  Internally, you're going to be watched.
[01:21:33.022 --> 01:21:35.605]  Internally, your kids are going to wear masks.
[01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:40.203]  And the head of Pfizer now says, in Israel, they're up to their sixth shot.
[01:21:40.644 --> 01:21:42.226]  Now he wants you to have your fourth shot.
[01:21:42.626 --> 01:21:45.089]  And I'm sure everyone will dutifully line up.
[01:21:45.369 --> 01:21:49.654]  And it's all just a big act of submission to make us go along with it.
[01:21:49.694 --> 01:21:51.116]  So here is John Bowne's report.
[01:21:52.137 --> 01:22:04.133]  On how, beyond the communists, the biomedical tyranny has taken over Rhode Island, and we need to liberate these states intellectually, spiritually, culturally, and the blue cities, because they'll never be freed.
[01:22:04.494 --> 01:22:05.475]  They're under election fraud.
[01:22:05.495 --> 01:22:06.236]  They're under tyranny.
[01:22:06.817 --> 01:22:07.538]  Here's the report.
[01:22:07.638 --> 01:22:09.561]  We'll come back and hit a bunch of other critical news.
[01:22:11.383 --> 01:22:14.565]  Apparently Rhode Island is a quasi-communist state.
[01:22:14.785 --> 01:22:22.629]  And I'm glad that Rhode Islanders are coming out in droves and expressing their disapproval, their anger, and their disbelief at this overreach.
[01:22:22.809 --> 01:22:28.792]  How the legislation submitted by State Senator Sam Bell lies within the confines of the U.S.
[01:22:28.852 --> 01:22:31.133]  Constitution is anybody's guess.
[01:22:31.393 --> 01:22:37.536]  One of the main policies that Democrats have used to combat the pandemic has been vaccine mandates.
[01:22:37.856 --> 01:22:49.782]  The Providence Democrat uses the Biden administration's vaccine mandate as an example, though the mandate requiring either tests or vaccinations at larger companies was eventually struck down by the Supreme Court.
[01:22:50.203 --> 01:22:51.463]  It's a similar proposal.
[01:22:52.104 --> 01:22:53.424]  It's a little bit milder.
[01:22:54.365 --> 01:22:55.805]  It's not as dramatic.
[01:22:55.864 --> 01:23:04.644]   It has a remote work exemption and it does go beyond employment and has a financial penalty,
[01:23:04.644 --> 01:23:07.344]  but there's no direct compulsion.
[01:23:07.344 --> 01:23:13.243]   Democrat state Senator Sam Bell recently submitted a punitive bill ordering all Rhode Island
[01:23:13.243 --> 01:23:19.703]   residents and taxpayers over 16 years old to receive the Great Resets COVID-19 injection
[01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:25.304]   and boosters that are causing an epidemic of heart attacks and death mandated by the
[01:23:25.304 --> 01:23:27.384]  state's director of the Department of Health.
[01:23:27.384 --> 01:23:33.385]   The legislation read like a plank of communism stating this act would mandate all residents
[01:23:33.385 --> 01:23:37.425]  16 years or older to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
[01:23:37.425 --> 01:23:51.787]   If a resident is under 16 years of age, The resident would be required to be immunized against COVID-19 with the responsibility for ensuring compliance, falling on all parents or guardians with medical consent powers.
[01:23:52.087 --> 01:24:04.072]   Additionally, any person who violates this chapter would be required to pay a monthly civil penalty of $50 and would owe twice the amount of personal income taxes.
[01:24:04.312 --> 01:24:15.076]  In addition, three different doctors will have to state on record that the child is not fit for immunization in order for parents to receive an exemption for that minor.
[01:24:15.256 --> 01:24:18.357]  And the child themselves will have to sign the form.
[01:24:18.577 --> 01:24:23.899]  The state's health department will have the power to investigate any petition for exemption.
[01:24:24.099 --> 01:24:38.833]  Bell stands by his totalitarianism, claiming a survey conducted by Harvard, Northeastern, Northwestern, and Rutgers Universities proves that 65% of residents support the statewide vaccine mandate.
[01:24:38.853 --> 01:24:43.657]  You're a woman who lives in one of the most liberal states in the country, a state in which abortion is a sacrament.
[01:24:44.158 --> 01:24:47.621]  Did you believe it when they told you it was your body, your choice?
[01:24:49.372 --> 01:24:50.012]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:24:50.132 --> 01:24:56.259]  I never dreamed, never dreamed that I would find a bill like that introduced into the Rhode Island legislature.
[01:24:56.299 --> 01:25:08.712]  And as a matter of fact, the representatives that we spoke with later on told me that they had constituents calling them left and right to ask if it was real or if it was an internet hoax.
[01:25:09.372 --> 01:25:17.980]  In 2018, Senator Sam Bell was the first member of the Democratic Socialists of America to be elected to the Rhode Island General Assembly.
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:27.129]  Bell is mostly known for an investigation that he began that resulted in the NRA being forced to shut down its Rhode Island Political Action Committee.
[01:25:27.269 --> 01:25:33.335]  I remember going to the fundraiser and seeing all these men in suits with their big yellow gun control doesn't work buttons.
[01:25:33.955 --> 01:25:42.141]  There's a rally against this agent of communism for Rhode Islanders on May 14th.
[01:25:42.161 --> 01:25:48.105]  Don't sit back and allow the agents of George Soros to destroy your God-given rights.
[01:25:47.945 --> 01:25:49.945]  And that's what we're up against here in Rhode Island.
[01:25:49.945 --> 01:25:55.145]   There's a rally against this agent of communism for Rhode Islanders on May 14th.
[01:25:55.145 --> 01:26:00.825]   Don't sit back and allow the agents of George Soros to destroy your God-given rights.
[01:26:00.825 --> 01:26:02.585]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:26:02.585 --> 01:26:05.164]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:05.164 --> 01:26:07.745]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:07.745 --> 01:26:10.324]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:11.324 --> 01:26:13.905]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:13.905 --> 01:26:20.484]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:20.484 --> 01:26:23.064]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:23.064 --> 01:26:25.645]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:25.645 --> 01:26:28.225]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:37.645]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:37.645 --> 01:26:40.225]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:40.225 --> 01:26:42.804]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:42.804 --> 01:26:45.384]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:45.384 --> 01:26:47.965]  (upbeat music)
[01:26:47.608 --> 01:26:59.329]  I want to just say to everybody out there watching and listening that it is very, very heartening to see, without even trying to look, it's just everywhere, all of you out there battling for InfoWars.
[01:27:00.987 --> 01:27:06.729]  And the fact that you realize that InfoWars and its future is tied to humanity's future.
[01:27:06.749 --> 01:27:07.950]  It's a very, very precious thing.
[01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:14.893]  And, you know, we've got Jimmy Levy, who's been a very, very successful musician for over a decade and had a lot of hit songs.
[01:27:15.633 --> 01:27:17.794]  Joining us next hour is extremely smart and articulate.
[01:27:17.814 --> 01:27:20.395]  We'll cover the waterfront and dozens of issues with him.
[01:27:20.455 --> 01:27:27.398]  But he's had now three number one in the last year billboard songs.
[01:27:28.419 --> 01:27:28.619]  Three.
[01:27:29.966 --> 01:27:31.047]  With no corporate support.
[01:27:32.248 --> 01:27:38.652]  And again, that just shows how incredibly popular liberty and freedom is.
[01:27:38.872 --> 01:27:50.300]  And as a lot of people that have been on the fence about getting involved in the fight for freedom because of the deplatforming with immunization, the censorship, the Justice Department, the attacks.
[01:27:51.401 --> 01:28:02.126]   As people see how popular it is, it lets them have the courage to make the leap into Survival and success and so he'll be joining us.
[01:28:02.146 --> 01:28:24.702]   We'll play some of his amazing music Coming up on the other side of this quick break but Really look forward to him being with us coming up here In just a few minutes Now, after he leaves us, we have Wayne Allyn Root, who's always on fire and really has the President's ear, the real President, Donald Trump.
[01:28:25.582 --> 01:28:30.884]  He'll be talking about some really big issues that he's got front and center.
[01:28:31.484 --> 01:28:52.095]   And the battle, not for the Democratic Party, we know is totally global, it's out of control, but the battle for the Republican Party and why the establishment is so scared, because we are inches away Not just here, but in Brazil, and in Europe, and all over the place, on real pro-human, common sense, good people being elected.
[01:28:52.435 --> 01:29:18.027]   And so when the New World Order is trying to start wars, and the globalists are trying to collapse borders, and they're trying to devalue currencies, and they're promoting pedophilia, and shipping in, you know, triple the fentanyl that was shipped in under Trump, all of that is done with them trying to poison and stun us, and confuse us, and hurt us, so that we are so Under massive attack, that we're not even basically aware of what's ahead of us.
[01:29:18.087 --> 01:29:30.612]  So that's why, and I don't mean to harp on this, but that's why people realizing Infowars is a symbol of liberty and freedom, everybody needs to say, I'm with Infowars, I'm with Alex Jones.
[01:29:30.912 --> 01:29:47.319]   Not because I chose that, but because the way things unfolded Everybody from Joe Rogan, to Tucker Carlson, to Mike Tyson, to you name it, to Tim Pool, to so many others now say, Alex Jones was right, Alex Jones is good, Alex Jones isn't perfect, but he means well.
[01:29:47.699 --> 01:29:48.900]  We stand with Alex Jones.
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:58.107]  It's like in the movie Spartacus, that's based on a true story, a slave rebellion led by gladiators in Rome, 2,000 plus years ago.
[01:30:00.609 --> 01:30:03.332]  They're trying to find Spartacus's dead body on the battlefield.
[01:30:04.704 --> 01:30:16.133]  And they're crucifying people for 100 miles all the way in on the main road, was the Appian Way, if memory serves, into Rome and they say, where's Spartacus?
[01:30:16.153 --> 01:30:17.534]  And they'd say, I am Spartacus.
[01:30:18.675 --> 01:30:23.420]  And so, I'm not asking for that great honor.
[01:30:24.101 --> 01:30:27.144]  We have been given that great honor by you and by our fight, what we've done.
[01:30:27.164 --> 01:30:32.590]  And so now, In Before Wars is that standard that the enemy fears and wants to stop.
[01:30:32.670 --> 01:30:35.553]  So we are all Alex Jones now.
[01:30:36.394 --> 01:30:37.575]  And the enemy knows that.
[01:30:37.835 --> 01:30:38.735]  They can crush us.
[01:30:39.275 --> 01:30:40.656]  They believe they can crush you.
[01:30:41.116 --> 01:30:50.361]  And when we understand that and we celebrate the black sheep, and we celebrate the rebels that fight for freedom, we win instead of letting them bully us and control us with political correctness.
[01:30:50.401 --> 01:30:50.881]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:52.737 --> 01:30:54.338]  This is a war on religion.
[01:30:55.039 --> 01:30:57.260]  This is a war on the children.
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:00.342]  They give you the cure with the sickness.
[01:31:00.843 --> 01:31:03.204]  This is a war on tradition.
[01:31:03.745 --> 01:31:06.066]  This is a war on religion.
[01:31:06.667 --> 01:31:08.768]  This is a war on the children.
[01:31:09.408 --> 01:31:12.671]  They give you the cure with the sickness.
[01:31:12.691 --> 01:31:13.471]  This is a war.
[01:31:13.831 --> 01:31:17.530]   This is a war, oh This is a war that we live in, don't ever reveal to you
[01:31:17.530 --> 01:31:20.230]   that they also leave in killing you They don't tell you what the hell you were created to
[01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:23.420]   achieve in the hurdle, you don't know who's leading you Keep on proceeding to follow, your mind is so hollow, are
[01:31:23.420 --> 01:31:27.331]   you being coddled by government swallowing up everything that the media tell you without a question or a problem?
[01:31:27.331 --> 01:31:30.529]   All of these sheep being slaughtered, they poison the water, removing the father and trusting these daughters
[01:31:30.529 --> 01:31:33.131]   Ignoring blue collar, keeping the dollar and watching your sons and your daughters
[01:31:33.131 --> 01:31:36.029]   Ain't got any honor if I'm being honest, I just ain't picking this side
[01:31:36.029 --> 01:31:38.931]   But I'm gonna ride for my freedom and die for my freedom and question the government lies
[01:31:38.931 --> 01:31:41.831]   A lot on my mind, it's so little time, gotta thank all of us leading this time
[01:31:41.831 --> 01:31:44.831]   The devil he hides an ego and pride, they sell them, they sell them, they paying the price
[01:31:44.831 --> 01:31:47.730]   God won't give you more than you can handle, government should be dismantled
[01:31:47.730 --> 01:31:50.331]   Every politician gotta stand up, prepare for the war, we going to battle
[01:31:50.331 --> 01:32:00.650]   This is a war on religion, this is a war on the children They give you the cure with the sickness, this is a war on
[01:32:00.650 --> 01:32:07.530]   tradition This is a war on religion, this is a war on the children
[01:32:07.530 --> 01:32:13.831]   They give you the cure with the sickness, this is a war, this is a war
[01:32:13.831 --> 01:31:52.292]   I'd rather be red pill, get killed, than ignorant living in This is a war on religion

[01:31:58.292 --> 01:32:04.292]   This is a war on tradition This is a war on religion
[01:32:04.292 --> 01:32:10.292]   This is a war on the children They give you the cure with the sickness
[01:32:10.292 --> 01:32:15.292]   This is a war, this is a war I'd rather be red pill, get killed
[01:32:15.292 --> 01:32:18.292]   Than ignorant living in meat that's steel Don't stand up for something, you're falling for nothing
[01:32:18.292 --> 01:32:22.292]   This is the way to the world that we know for ill This is the revelation of a generation losing civilization
[01:32:22.292 --> 01:32:25.292]   I'm the terminator, just a liberator It's with our dedication for the terminator
[01:32:25.292 --> 01:32:28.292]   Fuck your medication, de-administration Can I alienate us or exterminate us?
[01:32:28.292 --> 01:32:31.292]   I'll just keep on praying for your salvation You are outdated, society becoming outrageous
[01:32:31.292 --> 01:32:34.292]   Keep your house painted for the firstborn The angel of death in its worst form
[01:32:34.292 --> 01:32:37.292]   We be in scorn, look out for they horns Remember this isn't they first war
[01:32:37.292 --> 01:32:40.292]   They come unprepared, so just be aware They do not want to hear none of your prayers
[01:32:40.292 --> 01:32:43.292]   This is a war that ain't playing fair They feed off your fear, they want and you scare
[01:32:43.292 --> 01:32:46.292]   Death and despair, it's all in the air Just be aware, you think I care?
[01:32:46.292 --> 01:32:50.292]   The more that you know, the more that it's clear This is a war on religion.
[01:32:50.292 --> 01:32:53.292]  [Music]
[01:32:51.398 --> 01:32:53.759]  This is a war on the children.
[01:32:54.119 --> 01:32:56.680]  They give you the cure with the sickness.
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:32:59.500]  This is a war on tradition.
[01:33:00.101 --> 01:33:02.541]  This is a war on religion.
[01:33:02.781 --> 01:33:05.102]  This is a war on the children.
[01:33:05.762 --> 01:33:09.003]  They give you the cure with the sickness.
[01:33:09.043 --> 01:33:10.424]  This is a war.
[01:33:10.524 --> 01:33:13.185]  This is a war.
[01:33:13.545 --> 01:33:14.485]  War of the slaves.
[01:33:15.291 --> 01:33:19.576]  So, it was over a year ago that one of his songs, Jimmy Leiby, went to number one.
[01:33:19.596 --> 01:33:20.277]  You just saw it.
[01:33:20.297 --> 01:33:20.998]  This is a war.
[01:33:21.559 --> 01:33:28.187]  Back when the lockdowns, the total control were intensifying in New York City, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:29.727 --> 01:33:33.228]  And now here we are in the year 2022 and they're going to be trying to bring them back.
[01:33:34.129 --> 01:33:35.970]  You can be guaranteed that's the case.
[01:33:36.610 --> 01:33:47.734]  So many number one hits, an example of not just talent, they deserve it, but the fact that despite the no corporation or big group promoted it, number one over and over again, showing the power of the people.
[01:33:47.775 --> 01:33:53.517]  Jimmy Levy, thank you so much for joining us on Twitter at Jimmy Levy Music, on Spotify Jimmy Levy.
[01:33:54.297 --> 01:34:01.602]  Number one billboard charting and multi-platinum recorded artist from South Florida has taken the EDM and hip-hop scenes by storm.
[01:34:02.022 --> 01:34:11.088]  Jimmy is a Hollywood finalist in season 18 of American Idol and since has released multiple dance hits, two of which top, now it's even more than that, the dance and rap hip-hop charts simultaneously.
[01:34:11.469 --> 01:34:15.691]   Both The Matrix and This Is War are inspired by his What's up, brother?
[01:34:15.711 --> 01:34:16.512]  Thank you for having me again.
[01:34:16.332 --> 01:34:21.131]   Order after finding his way back to God and being sober for a few months Jimmy is now
[01:34:21.131 --> 01:34:25.132]   And this is a bio from a year ago on his next project war of the mind
[01:34:25.132 --> 01:34:29.712]   Where he will speak on the spiritual and psychological warfare this blinded humanity as a whole
[01:34:29.712 --> 01:34:33.691]   He's here with us six months later if he first came on give us an update
[01:34:33.691 --> 01:34:38.612]   We salute him and we thank him we try to give him the floor to tell us where we're all going next
[01:34:38.612 --> 01:34:47.412]   We're so great to have you my friend Where do you want to start, brother?
[01:34:46.654 --> 01:34:47.735]  Because I got to ask a lot of questions.
[01:34:47.755 --> 01:34:49.396]  We got more big hits out.
[01:34:49.776 --> 01:34:50.856]  Where do people find your stuff?
[01:34:50.896 --> 01:34:52.617]  And what do you see in the world right now?
[01:34:52.637 --> 01:34:58.459]  Because you and others were instrumental, like Joe Rogan, in breaking the back of this cup of tyranny in the first round.
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:02.541]  So for my family and everybody I love, thank you, brother.
[01:35:04.242 --> 01:35:05.483]  And thank you, too, brother.
[01:35:06.983 --> 01:35:09.784]  Well, yeah, right now we're working on two separate projects.
[01:35:09.864 --> 01:35:13.526]  I have my project, A War of the Mind, that's still in the making.
[01:35:14.113 --> 01:35:16.155]  About the spiritual and psychological warfare.
[01:35:16.315 --> 01:35:22.220]  And then I also have my collaboration project with the rapper Hi-Rez that we put out now.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:26.243]  This is a war which we just got our number two billboard for.
[01:35:27.624 --> 01:35:31.087]  We got the Welcome to the Revolution, which was our second record.
[01:35:31.127 --> 01:35:34.610]  We got a number two billboard and then God over government.
[01:35:34.650 --> 01:35:36.171]  We have a billboard on the way coming.
[01:35:36.191 --> 01:35:37.452]  We're not sure what number yet.
[01:35:38.032 --> 01:35:41.375]  And we're going to have like three or four more songs on the album.
[01:35:41.395 --> 01:35:43.697]  It's going to be called Soundtrack to the Revolution.
[01:35:44.485 --> 01:35:46.847]  So I'm really excited about both of those projects.
[01:35:47.188 --> 01:35:53.514]  And moving forward, you're going to be seeing a lot of artists, like I said, coming forward, speaking out.
[01:35:53.594 --> 01:36:04.645]  I know since six months ago, when we last spoke, there's been a lot of new people joining the movement that have huge, you know, followings or have been in the industry for such a long time.
[01:36:04.685 --> 01:36:09.573]   And, you know, it's a blessing to see, you know, half of me says like, Okay.
[01:36:09.973 --> 01:36:11.393]  Like, you know, where were you?
[01:36:11.413 --> 01:36:12.074]  We've been waiting.
[01:36:12.094 --> 01:36:13.694]  The other half of me says, you know what?
[01:36:13.714 --> 01:36:15.234]  For the masses, it's good.
[01:36:15.274 --> 01:36:16.394]  Let them wake up, you know?
[01:36:16.814 --> 01:36:17.695]  Well, that's leadership.
[01:36:17.755 --> 01:36:19.555]  I mean, you're going to hear your words in their mouth.
[01:36:19.595 --> 01:36:20.755]  That's what trailblazing is.
[01:36:21.135 --> 01:36:22.055]  And that you're a real leader.
[01:36:22.075 --> 01:36:24.896]  You're going to celebrate the fact that you're shifting the whole industry.
[01:36:26.696 --> 01:36:29.037]  Yeah, it's a blessing, but it's God doing the work.
[01:36:30.357 --> 01:36:30.657]  It is.
[01:36:30.717 --> 01:36:36.878]  So, again, I got a thousand questions, but what has it been like with all these number one hits promoting liberty and freedom?
[01:36:38.251 --> 01:36:39.191]  How are you doing spiritually?
[01:36:39.211 --> 01:36:41.232]  Because I know the enemy comes after you when you're doing good work.
[01:36:42.953 --> 01:36:45.974]  Yeah, I've definitely had a lot of spiritual warfare attacks.
[01:36:46.574 --> 01:36:55.017]  There's been certain nights that I've woken up and I felt like dark hands like coming at me, like choking me.
[01:36:55.097 --> 01:36:58.058]  And you know, I would wake up out of it and then read Psalms.
[01:36:58.598 --> 01:37:00.939]  My go-to is Psalm 91 or Psalm 23.
[01:37:02.119 --> 01:37:04.700]  And just like rebuke all of that in the name of Jesus.
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:16.109]   Because those spiritual attacks, these witches in Hollywood, Really target the people that are speaking out the most and they, I don't know what type of ritual they're doing, but... No, you're dead right.
[01:37:16.129 --> 01:37:18.110]  So I would recommend you say the prayer before you go to sleep.
[01:37:18.170 --> 01:37:19.011]  I've had the same thing happen.
[01:37:19.711 --> 01:37:22.193]  And when I forget, we've got to say it every night before you go to bed.
[01:37:22.213 --> 01:37:22.573]  You're right.
[01:37:23.694 --> 01:37:23.934]  Yup.
[01:37:24.715 --> 01:37:28.117]  That is the real, you know, the real way to stop that from happening.
[01:37:29.058 --> 01:37:30.499]  What happened once you cried out to God?
[01:37:30.519 --> 01:37:30.979]  Did it stop?
[01:37:30.999 --> 01:37:32.740]  Oh yeah.
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:33.721]  Every single time.
[01:37:34.041 --> 01:37:43.362]   Anything that you review, It goes away because he's more powerful and you know, they like to tell you that these demons have any type of hold on you and they don't.
[01:37:43.442 --> 01:37:47.983]  The truth is they just want what you have, which is the image of God and God's power.
[01:37:50.583 --> 01:37:51.463]  Beautifully said.
[01:37:52.324 --> 01:37:53.704]  Again, I can ask a thousand questions.
[01:37:53.964 --> 01:37:55.444]  You've got the floor here for the hour.
[01:37:55.944 --> 01:37:56.784]  Go ahead and let him have it.
[01:37:58.965 --> 01:38:09.644]   So, yeah, I mean, I've been watching a lot of the music of people coming out and Um, slowly a lot of the lyrics in the music industry, people are starting to speak the truth.
[01:38:10.045 --> 01:38:16.053]  Um, a lot of the rallies and, um, like the freedom rallies that are happening all over the world.
[01:38:16.093 --> 01:38:19.638]  Yeah, they died down right now because a lot of the mandates are being lifted, but.
[01:38:20.074 --> 01:38:22.775]  Of course, we know that they're trying to give us what we want.
[01:38:23.156 --> 01:38:32.520]  And their main goal, because they didn't put all this billions of dollars and AI technology for no reason to just stop now, is to get us into that digital ID system.
[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:43.625]  And that's what I'm trying to wake up the artists to learn about, because all they know is this mandate or that mandate, but they don't understand they're literally trying to digitally enslave us and then physically.
[01:38:44.666 --> 01:38:49.368]  So I've been trying to create a new project that talks more about that in depth.
[01:38:49.872 --> 01:38:58.978]  So that people understand that it's more than just about the mandates, it's literally about the Agenda 2030 and the digital ID system that will start it off.
[01:39:00.719 --> 01:39:03.821]  Absolutely, and I'm seeing some of the images of your new stuff.
[01:39:04.201 --> 01:39:05.362]  This is game-changing.
[01:39:07.484 --> 01:39:09.525]  Yeah, I just saw it from Red Horns.
[01:39:09.765 --> 01:39:14.248]  In that video, it got a lot of controversy because of what I preach now.
[01:39:16.135 --> 01:39:21.718]  I was actually trying to showcase what, from my perspective, what it looks like walking in an industry.
[01:39:21.818 --> 01:39:25.781]  People said, oh, that's vehicle, it's vehicle, and it kind of is.
[01:39:25.801 --> 01:39:26.801]  I was trying to show what it looks like.
[01:39:26.821 --> 01:39:29.243]  No, you're showing what it's, no, no, no, no, exactly.
[01:39:29.263 --> 01:39:33.685]  It's like the Bible describing Satan on the mountain with Jesus isn't the Bible promoting Satan.
[01:39:33.945 --> 01:39:34.506]  It's showing it.
[01:39:35.866 --> 01:39:36.087]  Right.
[01:39:36.387 --> 01:39:38.628]  That's what I was trying to do with that video.
[01:39:39.188 --> 01:39:40.889]  We're going to play some of that coming up.
[01:39:44.864 --> 01:39:48.646]  You talked about, we're about to go to break, but you talked about how many people are waking up.
[01:39:48.666 --> 01:39:49.346]  What are you seeing?
[01:39:51.467 --> 01:39:53.468]  Um, I'm seeing a lot of people come back.
[01:39:53.829 --> 01:40:05.274]  Uh, you know, half of the people that wake up, they're like, they keep it to themselves and then they just stop pushing and spewing the things that they've been, you know, pushed into their illusion of reality.
[01:40:05.815 --> 01:40:14.975]   And then the other half, um, who have a lot of, I guess, dignity or whatever they have to apologize to the people that have been trying to wake
[01:40:14.975 --> 01:40:18.505]   them up, which I've actually been seeing a lot and it really surprises me.
[01:40:18.505 --> 01:40:24.505]   Stay right there. We're going to come back in with the song that's currently playing, "Welcome to the Revolution."
[01:40:24.505 --> 01:40:32.505]   Then we're going to play on air "Redhorns" for folks. Feet with Rick Ross and so much more with Jimmy Levy right now.
[01:40:32.505 --> 01:40:33.505]  Stay with us.
[01:40:33.505 --> 01:40:47.505]   We will not comply with the institution's sick illusion, or we won't be televised.
[01:40:47.779 --> 01:40:56.179]   Welcome to the revolution We will fight
[01:40:56.179 --> 01:41:05.939]   Let the institutions take illusion No, we won't be satisfied
[01:41:05.939 --> 01:41:12.579]   Welcome to the revolution The revolution won't be televised
[01:41:12.579 --> 01:41:15.458]   Government been telling lies If you're not with us, you gotta step aside
[01:41:15.458 --> 01:41:17.618]   Witnessing the genocide Everything is centralized
[01:41:17.618 --> 01:41:20.979]   The food that we consume and they spraying it All we pesticides easily identify
[01:41:20.979 --> 01:41:24.259]   The sheep and the snake, the real and the fake Giving us a reason to pray
[01:41:24.259 --> 01:41:26.739]   I'ma make my own choices A voice for the voiceless
[01:41:26.739 --> 01:41:31.458]   They trying to destroy us, avoiding the poison It's all pointless if you don't have a purpose
[01:41:31.458 --> 01:41:35.300]   If you read the verses, you'll know who we versing Government can tell you what you're worth is
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:38.259]   Look deeper than the surface They don't even want you researching
[01:41:38.259 --> 01:41:42.899]   Or asking questions, we all being destined Shh, shut your mouth and comply, this the message
[01:41:42.899 --> 01:41:46.099]   Want you to rest on prescriptions That mess with your head, got you stressing
[01:41:46.099 --> 01:41:51.059]   Suppressing expression We will not comply
[01:41:51.059 --> 01:42:00.819]   With the institution's sick illusion No, it won't be televised
[01:42:00.819 --> 01:42:08.979]   Welcome to the revolution We will not comply
[01:42:09.343 --> 01:42:10.617]  That song we played earlier.
[01:42:12.719 --> 01:42:20.981]  This is Warfeet, it's powerful, but Welcome to the Revolution is as good as it gets, and just blows the Satanist away, what God's inspiration is.
[01:42:21.021 --> 01:42:25.702]  We'll put a little bit of Redhorn's feet with our guest here, Jimmy Levy, in a minute.
[01:42:25.722 --> 01:42:28.163]  I read his old bio, he got off Twitter, he's sick of their censorship.
[01:42:28.563 --> 01:42:33.744]  He's at JimmyLevyShop.com and at Jimmy Levy on Getter, Spotify, Jimmy Levy.
[01:42:33.784 --> 01:42:36.085]  So he has put his money where his mouth is.
[01:42:36.365 --> 01:42:43.407]   We'll ask him about Twitter and Elon Musk next segment, but Getting back to this, I was talking to you during the break, I said, what do you want to hit next?
[01:42:43.427 --> 01:42:47.208]  You said abortion and how they're pushing infanticide of already born babies.
[01:42:47.228 --> 01:42:49.748]  And you were saying that's triggered something big.
[01:42:49.768 --> 01:42:50.428]  Tell us about that.
[01:42:52.089 --> 01:42:52.369]  Yeah.
[01:42:52.409 --> 01:42:59.250]  So, you know, we've been hearing about abortion for a long time and there's always a debate about what is okay, what isn't okay.
[01:42:59.310 --> 01:43:04.771]  Spiritually, we know that it is not okay and that this is a sacrifice of a child.
[01:43:05.011 --> 01:43:18.393]   But recently when they allowed, um, Born babies after 26 or 28 days to be sacrificed, many people on the side that were defending abortion have woken up.
[01:43:18.953 --> 01:43:20.394]  Because there's always such a debate.
[01:43:20.474 --> 01:43:28.077]  I always see the debate of, oh, on the morality side of things, whether or not it's okay to do it or whether or not it's okay.
[01:43:28.137 --> 01:43:32.639]  And then the same thing for when it comes to changing a child's gender.
[01:43:33.732 --> 01:43:37.273]  They're always going back and forth about, oh, what that child wants, what this wants.
[01:43:38.133 --> 01:43:52.638]  At the end of the day, it's all about getting to the children, you know, and people don't want to look at the real thing that actually matters when looking into these things and understanding what the answer should be, which is the spiritual origin of all of these things.
[01:43:53.218 --> 01:43:58.800]  So when you have the abortion, it is actually coming from the worship of Mullah.
[01:43:58.860 --> 01:44:02.121]  People would sat inside of the woman and in her parts.
[01:44:02.577 --> 01:44:06.380]  And in order to do a sacrifice, pull out the child and give it to Mullah.
[01:44:06.680 --> 01:44:08.962]  And that's where this whole entire thing came from.
[01:44:08.982 --> 01:44:28.177]  And then you have the worship of Baphomet, which many... There was a statue in Detroit that they put up, I think in 2016, very publicly on display, which shows Baphomet, the devil, and they show a little boy and a little girl looking up at it and the cross duality thing, which they try to push in the media now, this whole duality thing.
[01:44:28.889 --> 01:44:34.573]  And it's very clear that they are showing you that it is of the devil's work to change a child's gender.
[01:44:34.873 --> 01:44:45.440]  And that is how, just like we would go to church or even at home and pray to Jesus, and you're giving God the glory, the way to give glory to Mullah is to get an abortion and sacrifice your child to Mullah.
[01:44:45.741 --> 01:44:50.984]  The way to give glory to Baphomet is to change your child's gender, and that is giving glory to Baphomet.
[01:44:51.264 --> 01:44:56.348]  And then you have Baal, who was on Epstein's Island, you saw the owl that was on top of that satanic temple.
[01:44:56.752 --> 01:45:05.297]  And what they were doing under that temple was cutting out the heart and eating it together while standing in a circle, and that's how they give glory to Baal.
[01:45:05.677 --> 01:45:17.103]  And all of these people, they debate back and forth on the secular subjects and the regular common things of, oh yeah, what's moral, what's not okay to do, but they don't talk about the spiritual origin.
[01:45:17.143 --> 01:45:18.764]  Everybody forgets the spiritual origin.
[01:45:19.084 --> 01:45:27.303]   If everyone knew the spiritual origin of everything on this earth, on this firmament, Then they would understand what they should and shouldn't do in a second.
[01:45:27.343 --> 01:45:28.524]  There's no debate about it.
[01:45:31.305 --> 01:45:35.548]  Beautifully said, my friend, and it's all coming to a head as it gets more and more out in the open.
[01:45:36.028 --> 01:45:39.370]  Why do you think the Satanists are so, so brazen now?
[01:45:41.511 --> 01:45:42.832]  Because their time is coming.
[01:45:42.852 --> 01:45:53.643]   The end of times is really, you know, there's been many times that seemed like it was the end of times, but right now we've never had Like I said on your show before, all these slip-ups happen.
[01:45:54.003 --> 01:45:58.164]  We had that Travis Scott concert that was clearly very satanic.
[01:45:58.204 --> 01:46:05.785]  We had a lot of, we had in Australia, a whole satanic occult scene pop up on the screen in the middle of nightly news.
[01:46:06.305 --> 01:46:09.626]  Then we have all these big statues, a satanic club in kids' schools.
[01:46:09.886 --> 01:46:14.287]  It's getting more, it's not that it's anything new, it's just getting more and more obvious.
[01:46:15.083 --> 01:46:42.621]   Yeah, we're awake and we already see what's going on, but the people that don't see and that call all this conspiracy and whatever, they're finally seeing, and they know that if the masses wake up, their game is over, their charade is over, because everyone will turn to God and realize that Satan was so real, and if there was an atheist, if Satan was real, That means God gets all the glory now, and they're scared because once their time is up, they can't control, they can't conquer and divide, they can't do anything.
[01:46:42.641 --> 01:46:45.182]  They have no power here on earth, and they never did.
[01:46:46.363 --> 01:46:48.364]  Jimmy Levy, I totally agree with you.
[01:46:48.624 --> 01:46:57.328]  Multiple number one, number two heads on the billboard charts, and it just shows freedom and God and justice and life and survival and...
[01:46:58.863 --> 01:47:04.185]  Experience and just the open universe is what we all want, but there's free will.
[01:47:04.605 --> 01:47:06.066]  That's why these Satanists exist.
[01:47:06.086 --> 01:47:08.107]  People blame God for allowing this.
[01:47:08.147 --> 01:47:08.847]  No, that's free will.
[01:47:08.907 --> 01:47:09.627]  God didn't do that.
[01:47:11.208 --> 01:47:11.408]  Right.
[01:47:11.428 --> 01:47:12.408]  It is free will.
[01:47:12.488 --> 01:47:14.129]  Everything on this earth is free will.
[01:47:15.329 --> 01:47:19.751]  I noticed so because I'm a Messianic Jew, so I'm a Jew kind of Jew for Jesus.
[01:47:20.091 --> 01:47:23.892]  I learned both sides of how both Christians and Jews use Satan.
[01:47:23.952 --> 01:47:26.119]   So from what I've learned, Okay.
[01:47:26.139 --> 01:47:26.400]  Okay.
[01:47:26.239 --> 01:47:31.519]   Christians view Satan as someone directly up against God who was casted down as a fallen
[01:47:31.519 --> 01:47:34.559]  angel once he tried to take God's throne.
[01:47:34.559 --> 01:47:35.559]  And the way that Jews...
[01:47:35.559 --> 01:47:36.559]  Okay.
[01:47:36.559 --> 01:47:37.559]  Okay.
[01:47:37.559 --> 01:47:38.559]  I love you.
[01:47:38.559 --> 01:47:39.559]  I love you.
[01:47:39.559 --> 01:47:40.559]  All right.
[01:47:40.559 --> 01:47:40.559]  I want to hear this.
[01:47:40.559 --> 01:47:47.559]  All right.
[01:47:47.559 --> 01:47:49.559]  I want to hear this.
[01:47:50.244 --> 01:47:53.646]  This is powerful, but somebody else cut it on the feed.
[01:47:53.726 --> 01:47:57.269]  I heard it in my ear, and Jimmy Levy got shut down.
[01:47:57.649 --> 01:47:59.010]  I've never heard this with any guest.
[01:47:59.810 --> 01:48:02.032]  Somebody else cut it on the feed and was talking in my ear.
[01:48:03.673 --> 01:48:05.033]  Is Jimmy Levy back now?
[01:48:05.053 --> 01:48:13.419]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[01:48:14.219 --> 01:48:15.180]  We're going to figure this out.
[01:48:16.616 --> 01:48:17.357]  We're going to come back.
[01:48:17.377 --> 01:48:23.623]  We're going to hear what he had to say about the way Christians versus Jews see the devil.
[01:48:23.763 --> 01:48:24.844]  This is really important.
[01:48:25.485 --> 01:48:26.466]  This guy's really smart.
[01:48:26.586 --> 01:48:28.048]  He'd be a great talk show host.
[01:48:28.608 --> 01:48:30.050]  He really is tuned into what's happening.
[01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.750]  We're going to go to break.
[01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:33.270]  Jimmy are you back yet?
[01:48:33.270 --> 01:48:45.473]   All right, we're gonna figure this out I don't know if it's on his end or our end or what it is, but God Almighty, it never ends, I tell you.
[01:48:45.574 --> 01:48:50.619]  So let's just get him on the phone because I'm not going to do this for an hour, okay?
[01:48:52.061 --> 01:48:54.043]  Do this dance where Skype breaks up.
[01:48:54.423 --> 01:48:55.765]  We'll come right back with Jimmy Levy.
[01:48:55.805 --> 01:48:59.549]  We're going to come in with the Red Horns Feet.
[01:49:00.814 --> 01:49:02.517]  For a few minutes, then go right back to him.
[01:49:02.978 --> 01:49:04.661]  On the other side, InfoWars.com.
[01:49:05.222 --> 01:49:06.804]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:49:06.824 --> 01:49:10.330]  Obviously, the system does not want you to hear this information.
[01:49:10.751 --> 01:49:12.751]  Make sure it gets out to everyone you know.
[01:49:12.751 --> 01:49:26.751]  [Music]
[01:49:26.751 --> 01:49:37.751]   Don't you rain on my parade. Bring your demons, I'm not afraid.
[01:49:37.751 --> 01:49:43.751]   Push me right off the highest mountain. Hater bulls try to keep from drowning.
[01:49:43.751 --> 01:49:48.751]  Learning up, I got a fever, but I gotta sweat it out.
[01:49:48.751 --> 01:49:54.751]  You won't dance on my grip. Better throw your shovel away.
[01:49:54.751 --> 01:50:00.751]  Whether you go or you stay, I'm gonna make it either way.
[01:50:00.751 --> 01:50:06.751]   Push me right off the highest mountain. Hater bulls try to keep from drowning.
[01:50:06.751 --> 01:50:10.751]  Learning up, I got a fever, but I gotta sweat it out.
[01:50:10.751 --> 01:50:16.751]  This is life. Take a beating, and a pill for the pain.
[01:50:16.751 --> 01:50:22.751]  But I feel fine in the morning, 'cause I woke up again.
[01:50:22.751 --> 01:50:28.751]  Ooh, another day in paradise for you and me, my friend.
[01:50:28.751 --> 01:50:30.751]  Ooh, red horn.
[01:50:30.269 --> 01:50:54.269]   Try to get me Nothing nobody chain stepping off with a plane Louie
[01:50:54.269 --> 01:50:57.988]   luggage with days Gucci duffel and loaf streets feel like a parade
[01:50:58.349 --> 01:51:03.668]   Every night we celebrate so let the bottles pop go to sleep on Fisher Island wake up on the yacht
[01:51:03.668 --> 01:51:10.128]   FaceTiming me he calling me from in a box Commissary on his books in a pair of socks touch the money.
[01:51:10.128 --> 01:51:15.387]   They can never tell you when to stop Eating lemon rubber wings like it's really lobster
[01:51:16.064 --> 01:51:18.169]  Scars on my back like I was on a star.
[01:51:18.451 --> 01:51:21.451]  But we all join the hands for one common cause.
[01:51:21.451 --> 01:51:23.451]  One.
[01:51:23.451 --> 01:51:26.451]  God is gracious, bro.
[01:51:26.451 --> 01:51:29.451]  We all brothers and sisters.
[01:51:29.451 --> 01:51:33.451]  We all have a bigger purpose.
[01:51:33.451 --> 01:51:38.451]  Bless his Lord.
[01:51:38.451 --> 01:51:41.451]  One.
[01:51:41.451 --> 01:51:43.451]  Alright, that's Jimmy Levy.
[01:51:43.211 --> 01:51:47.114]  With red horns feet with Rick Ross.
[01:51:49.356 --> 01:51:53.179]  Which shows the women going from being under demonic control, back to God.
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:58.363]  And of course the Pharisees would say it was satanic, but it's obviously the opposite.
[01:51:58.423 --> 01:51:59.424]  So this is war.
[01:52:00.606 --> 01:52:14.996]  Feet with Hi-Rez, Welcome to the Revolution with Hi-Rez, God over government, Feet Hi-Rez, Red Horns, Feet, Reg Rush, that Shadow and Matrix coming up, but your Skype cut out, somebody literally broke into it, other people broke into it, never seen that happen before.
[01:52:15.357 --> 01:52:27.926]  Jimmy Levy, start over with, you're a messianic Jew, you believe in Jesus Christ, but you're explaining, which is in the Old Testament, New Testament, there's, it's very complex, but there's different versions of the devil, but it's showing us different facets of it.
[01:52:28.366 --> 01:52:37.349]   Start over with what So, yeah, those were the demons.
[01:52:37.389 --> 01:52:40.350]  They did not want that to come out for whatever reason.
[01:52:41.050 --> 01:52:48.592]  But, yeah, as a Messianic Jew, I see both sides of the coin for how the Christians and Jewish people view Satan.
[01:52:50.012 --> 01:52:54.373]  In Christianity, it's obviously a figure that is directly up against God.
[01:52:54.393 --> 01:52:58.174]  He was casted down for trying to overthrow God.
[01:52:58.669 --> 01:53:09.176]  And then in Judaism, he works for God in the heavenly court as the person who tempts people and takes notes of the sins and what they got tempted by.
[01:53:09.756 --> 01:53:11.997]  So, I kind of mix the two together.
[01:53:12.017 --> 01:53:17.841]  I do believe it's a figure because of my experience around people that worship that.
[01:53:18.542 --> 01:53:24.405]  And, you know, I also can see how, you know, because we know God is in control and there is free will.
[01:53:26.141 --> 01:53:34.432]  He can, you know, maybe there is a possible way he is setting people up in certain ways to test them and see their faith.
[01:53:34.652 --> 01:53:35.533]  So I don't know.
[01:53:35.914 --> 01:53:37.356]  I do know it's darkness.
[01:53:37.856 --> 01:53:42.903]  I don't want any part in it, but I do understand both sides of how they view it.
[01:53:43.755 --> 01:53:53.638]  Well, Jimmy, let me just tell you, somebody that has studied Jewish writings of mysticism and the Old Testament, which is Jewish, and the New Testament that is Jewish, that what you're saying is non-contradictory.
[01:53:54.398 --> 01:54:03.321]  The devil has multifaceted points, but God sent the devil to test Christ his Son on the mountain after he had fasted to make himself weak.
[01:54:03.661 --> 01:54:05.642]  To his weakest point, he offered the whole world.
[01:54:05.762 --> 01:54:07.683]  So, it's not contradictory.
[01:54:07.763 --> 01:54:09.704]  That's what the New Testament says as well.
[01:54:10.044 --> 01:54:19.068]  It isn't like God likes the fact that Satan rebelled and tried to do all this, but now Satan is there and comes and asks God, what can I do to this person?
[01:54:19.108 --> 01:54:20.089]  What can I do to that person?
[01:54:20.389 --> 01:54:28.693]  And when God chooses, God lifts the hedge, like with Job, saying, nothing you can do.
[01:54:29.974 --> 01:54:30.755]  Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[01:54:30.574 --> 01:54:35.413]   against me. Same thing with King David and it was that process of God lifting
[01:54:35.413 --> 01:54:39.534]   the hedge so that his most loved could be attacked just to prove the point
[01:54:39.534 --> 01:54:43.413]   because there's not skin in the game there's not blood in the game. Does that
[01:54:43.413 --> 01:54:48.175]   make sense my friend? Yeah that makes a lot of sense so it does incorporate both
[01:54:48.175 --> 01:54:52.453]   sides at the end of the day. What else what else great knowledge you got for us?
[01:54:52.453 --> 01:54:59.654]   I did learn I don't know if you've ever heard about the G theory
[01:54:58.477 --> 01:55:04.459]  Um, a lot of people were telling me that, um, the G is in God.
[01:55:04.619 --> 01:55:13.345]   So how we say in Jesus name, there's this G theory where everything on this earth is in G. So when we walk, We're not walking.
[01:55:13.385 --> 01:55:15.666]  We're walking NG, so we walk NG.
[01:55:15.966 --> 01:55:17.847]  When we talk, we talk NG talking.
[01:55:18.147 --> 01:55:19.847]  When we sing, we sing NG.
[01:55:19.887 --> 01:55:21.348]  When we pray, we pray NG.
[01:55:21.628 --> 01:55:31.651]  But there's a reason for the NG, considering that all words on this earth, especially in English language, are spells, which, you know, in the New Age, they say manifest.
[01:55:31.811 --> 01:55:34.771]  Yeah, we're made in God's image, so everything we say is power.
[01:55:36.272 --> 01:55:36.452]  Right.
[01:55:37.072 --> 01:55:40.093]  But they try to take that away from us using the English language.
[01:55:40.560 --> 01:55:47.862]  Which compared to Hebrew and Aramaic, that the original scriptures were on, were more spiritual and had... No, I agree.
[01:55:47.882 --> 01:55:59.006]  The English language is the global dominant language because it's an amalgamation of barbarian languages and others, which kind of scientifically cubes out the words to a different level.
[01:55:59.346 --> 01:56:06.877]   And you're right, the Aramaic and the Jewish language and others Right.
[01:56:08.097 --> 01:56:22.061]  So as long as we're using basically their language that they've created for us, we're still going to be living in their matrix.
[01:56:22.521 --> 01:56:30.423]  And then obviously God sets us out of that matrix, giving us that discernment to see what it is that we are saying, but beyond the actual word.
[01:56:32.001 --> 01:56:32.521]  Powerful.
[01:56:32.801 --> 01:56:33.542]  Lay more on me.
[01:56:36.963 --> 01:56:42.405]  Well, in the next couple of months, I do see a lot of artists coming forward fully.
[01:56:42.425 --> 01:56:46.567]  I don't know if you saw, did you watch Wash the Waters?
[01:56:47.387 --> 01:56:47.667]  I did.
[01:56:49.088 --> 01:56:49.988]  What did you think of it?
[01:56:52.589 --> 01:56:53.309]  Very complex.
[01:56:53.349 --> 01:56:53.909]  Give me your view.
[01:56:55.450 --> 01:57:00.272]  So, you know, I think it makes more sense as far as the snakes.
[01:57:00.919 --> 01:57:10.903]  Then as the bats, obviously, I never looked at the bats as anything to do with this whole pandemic, but the snakes, it's the symbol of all evil.
[01:57:11.023 --> 01:57:14.905]  And it would make sense that these people, because they're already doing it spiritually.
[01:57:15.405 --> 01:57:27.311]  And you know, on the television, psychologically, that they would want to do it direct with the medical movement and, you know, poison all of God's children with the serpents DNA.
[01:57:27.791 --> 01:57:29.191]  It makes a hundred percent sense.
[01:57:29.351 --> 01:57:44.157]   And I was on a Well, I was supposed to be on this tour that I left because of multiple reasons and Dr. Artis, who was on there and was going to speak about those things, was actually taken off of the tour.
[01:57:44.658 --> 01:57:49.821]  So, you know, if a lot of people are censoring within the movement, I think that there's no point.
[01:57:49.841 --> 01:57:57.567]  The whole point of freedom is to have different takes and, you know, the scientific method, we have to question everything.
[01:57:58.001 --> 01:58:00.302]  We can't just all have one side and all the other side.
[01:58:00.562 --> 01:58:01.522]  There's got to be a middle.
[01:58:01.602 --> 01:58:04.223]  There's got to be a half of the middle, you know?
[01:58:04.243 --> 01:58:12.926]  So yeah, I definitely want to look into that more, but I really think that it makes a lot more sense than what happened with the bats.
[01:58:13.146 --> 01:58:27.311]  And, you know, I think a lot more is going to come out and it will kind of disturb the entire medical freedom movement because a lot of the current treatments are not actual treatments for what this new information brings.
[01:58:28.971 --> 01:58:31.533]  Well, I agree that a cocktail of weapons are attacking us.
[01:58:33.015 --> 01:58:35.057]  And this is all a big test in depopulation.
[01:58:35.337 --> 01:58:36.498]  We're going to break in 20 seconds.
[01:58:36.558 --> 01:58:37.639]  What are we going to hit on the other side?
[01:58:39.681 --> 01:58:40.081]  What happened?
[01:58:40.802 --> 01:58:42.063]  What do you want to cover when we come back?
[01:58:43.805 --> 01:58:48.469]  When I come back, I want to cover different lyrics and how backwards it means something different.
[01:58:49.798 --> 01:58:50.859]  We know that goes on.
[01:58:50.879 --> 01:58:52.919]  All right, Jimmy Levy is our guest.

[02:00:40.332 --> 02:00:43.131]   I feel this deep in my bones and my core I'm going hard to my team, I'm with the team
[02:00:43.131 --> 02:00:47.132]   God over government Featuring Hi-Rez
[02:00:47.132 --> 02:00:49.723]   And wow, so impressive That's just part of it.
[02:00:49.743 --> 02:00:52.565]  Timmy Levy, congratulations on all the work you've done.
[02:00:52.585 --> 02:00:58.450]  You've got a bunch of new stuff about to come out, but you guys really helped break the back, currently, of their big COVID tyranny power grab.
[02:00:58.471 --> 02:00:59.331]  We just salute you.
[02:00:59.932 --> 02:01:07.959]  And we were talking before the break, you wanted to hit some other big important news about lyrics, about manipulation of language, all this new fake language they're coming out with.
[02:01:08.359 --> 02:01:09.140]  Elaborate on that.
[02:01:10.981 --> 02:01:14.084]  Yes, so I grew up in a psychic family.
[02:01:14.497 --> 02:01:23.884]  So that's what gave me a little bit of the spiritual side of things to see different and of course I kind of had to break a generational curse because that does open portals to other things.
[02:01:25.305 --> 02:01:30.408]  However, I do believe God does give certain gifts to people to see certain things and help certain people.
[02:01:31.649 --> 02:01:35.812]  And my grandma was the number one psychic in the world and she was a psychic to the stars.
[02:01:36.452 --> 02:01:40.155]  So a lot of the artists would basically have her as like their therapist.
[02:01:40.215 --> 02:01:41.396]  They would talk to her about everything.
[02:01:42.045 --> 02:01:53.513]  And once she saw, right before she passed away last year, um, she saw a lot of the artists, um, they would tell her that they would put lyrics and put things backwards in songs.
[02:01:54.213 --> 02:02:07.923]  Um, if they were in certain contracts with, uh, labels or, you know, with certain managers and they weren't allowed to speak out about what they wanted to say or about their depression because they had to keep on a happy face for the public, they would put things backwards.
[02:02:08.003 --> 02:02:17.425]   Like for example, um, If they were depressed, they would be like, I'm so sad or the devil has me and stuff like that in a backwards type of chant motion.
[02:02:17.845 --> 02:02:26.050]  You also see that in a lot of music videos that are all over, um, especially ones that have caused people not to be here anymore.
[02:02:26.090 --> 02:02:46.823]   And mine, from what I've viewed, um, I don't know if you know about him, he, she, for example, he was working on, um, he was one of the biggest DJs in the world and he was working on, um, A huge movie about the children that are being trafficked, and he made a music video basically hunting pedophiles and branding them all on their backs with the word pedophilia.
[02:02:47.243 --> 02:02:53.347]  And that was on one of his major songs, which some of them were huge, like, the feel them away through the darkness.
[02:02:53.367 --> 02:02:54.368]  He had that huge one.
[02:02:54.688 --> 02:02:58.491]  All the big, like, EDM songs that he had that traveled the world.
[02:02:58.551 --> 02:03:03.254]  And after that, things started going downhill, and he had, like, a big depression.
[02:03:03.314 --> 02:03:11.937]   And then they said that he took his life, but The true people that watched him and followed his journey and saw what he was speaking about know exactly what happened.
[02:03:11.977 --> 02:03:12.857]  And it's very sad.
[02:03:13.218 --> 02:03:17.980]  And a lot of these artists, you have to really listen to their lyrics and then play the songs backwards.
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:27.585]  My grandma told me after being around all the biggest people, she was with Michael Jackson, Elvis, and anyone in politics and the music industry, you name it.
[02:03:28.075 --> 02:03:38.825]  And she would tell me a lot of them would do that same method because that was the only way that they could use their actual voice instead of what was being written for them or what they were being told to write if they were a writer.
[02:03:40.453 --> 02:03:41.033]  Absolutely.
[02:03:41.093 --> 02:03:42.454]  Hidden things everywhere.
[02:03:42.754 --> 02:03:48.596]  And now as the Satanism comes out in the open and people reject it and then Satan doubles down, doubles down, doubles down.
[02:03:48.936 --> 02:03:51.077]  What do you expect is about to happen in the next few years?
[02:03:51.097 --> 02:04:00.980]  Because we're already in just an incredible time with nuclear war threats with Russia and biomedical tyranny and open borders and devalued currencies and pedophilia being promoted openly.
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:03.421]  I mean, everything we've talked about is now out in the open.
[02:04:04.961 --> 02:04:05.181]  Right.
[02:04:05.241 --> 02:04:18.433]   I mean, everything is there and those people You know, the only ones at this point that aren't seeing what's going on are the ones that don't want to believe it and want to continue believing the illusion of reality that they've been presented their entire life.
[02:04:18.874 --> 02:04:21.235]  And they don't want to break that bubble, but it's all fear.
[02:04:21.295 --> 02:04:23.556]  So at the end of the day, they do truly believe it.
[02:04:23.576 --> 02:04:25.918]  They just don't want to admit that they were wrong.
[02:04:26.658 --> 02:04:29.840]  And, you know, I do think it's going to get more and more obvious.
[02:04:29.940 --> 02:04:33.862]  I think that, you know, this is a sad thing, but guess what?
[02:04:33.902 --> 02:04:50.104]   We do have to go through a tribulation and I do think There's going to be a lot of very blatant Satanism in schools and it's going to have to get to that point where all the darkness is really, really at the forefront and really just there until everybody just breaks and then looks for a savior.
[02:04:50.504 --> 02:04:55.665]  And that's when people are going to, you know, start depending on man and we only have to depend on God.
[02:04:55.725 --> 02:05:00.786]  But those who already didn't have faith in God and now see what's going on, they're first going to look to man.
[02:05:01.106 --> 02:05:03.206]  So those are going to be the lost in this case.
[02:05:03.346 --> 02:05:05.807]  And we're going to have to really keep our eye out and see.
[02:05:06.291 --> 02:05:13.655]  Who can be this Antichrist that is going to rise to save everybody once the blatant Satanism is everywhere?
[02:05:14.695 --> 02:05:18.257]  You know, I see a lot of people praising different men on this earth.
[02:05:18.957 --> 02:05:22.699]  And, you know, at the end of the day, we can't make any idols out of people.
[02:05:22.739 --> 02:05:25.641]  We have to only praise God and rejoice and give glory to God.
[02:05:26.121 --> 02:05:29.222]  So, you know, it doesn't matter what everything appears.
[02:05:29.262 --> 02:05:31.103]  There's always a second agenda.
[02:05:31.624 --> 02:05:57.017]   I see a lot of people talking about Yeah, so, you know, I think it's cool to celebrate freedom and celebrate us getting our freedom back in any way, but I feel like we're just finding a way to celebrate our freedom.
[02:05:57.057 --> 02:06:28.356]   And, you know, using my discernment, I don't trust it, and I do think it's a way for Either everybody to get back on Twitter that once left because of the swamp that it became, and my Twitter got removed, or I think that there's another whole agenda to track down everybody's data and, you know, watch and be able to build everybody's brain based off of what they do using their technology, because that's what he's heavily involved with, you know?
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:34.702]  His goal is to connect the internet to the brain and everybody keeps forgetting that.
[02:06:34.742 --> 02:06:39.823]  We can't just forget that because he bought Twitter and is making a few tweets that please people.
[02:06:40.224 --> 02:06:43.325]  At the end of the day, we only have to count on God for everything.
[02:06:44.165 --> 02:06:47.386]  Especially all the good and all the darkness to be away.
[02:06:47.446 --> 02:06:52.788]  We can never count on man because there's always two hands in everything.
[02:06:52.848 --> 02:06:54.869]  There's the hand of darkness and the hand of light.
[02:06:54.929 --> 02:06:58.430]  And in this case, there's more in the hand of darkness on his side.
[02:06:59.851 --> 02:07:00.532]  Powerful!
[02:07:00.672 --> 02:07:03.013]  Jimmy Levy, we got to get you back on more often.
[02:07:03.033 --> 02:07:07.015]  Thanks for going on Owen Troyer's show and Harrison Smith, the other broadcaster.
[02:07:07.035 --> 02:07:08.216]  We really appreciate you.
[02:07:08.576 --> 02:07:10.457]  People can find all your new music and more.
[02:07:11.458 --> 02:07:12.598]  What's the best place to go for that?
[02:07:15.340 --> 02:07:24.285]  Right now, well, we have Spotify, Apple Music, and I think because I already got a few warnings from some of these companies.
[02:07:24.801 --> 02:07:26.162]  Thank you for the time, brother.
[02:07:26.182 --> 02:07:26.523]  Yes, sir.
[02:07:26.462 --> 02:07:32.622]   for the speech, the type of speech. I mean maybe a free speech person can take over Spotify or Apple.
[02:07:32.622 --> 02:07:37.902]   But until then I'm probably going to be making a music site where I only have my music exclusively
[02:07:37.902 --> 02:07:42.381]   on there. For now it'll be under Jimmy Lovey Shop. I'm going to put it to Jimmy Lovey Music
[02:07:42.381 --> 02:07:48.141]   Prevention. Beautiful, thank you for the time brother. Yes sir, thank you. All right, Wayne
[02:07:48.141 --> 02:07:49.582]  Allen Root's about to take over.
[02:07:49.835 --> 02:07:52.137]  Then the war room in an hour and like five minutes from now.
[02:07:53.259 --> 02:07:56.422]  Separately, thank you listeners for last week's support.
[02:07:56.523 --> 02:07:57.684]  Thank you for the donations.
[02:07:58.205 --> 02:08:00.347]  Thank you for buying the products which will enrich your life.
[02:08:00.908 --> 02:08:02.590]  Thank you for your word of mouth and your prayer.
[02:08:04.008 --> 02:08:06.309]  But we need support now, plus you need the products we have.
[02:08:06.690 --> 02:08:16.476]  If you haven't had Deep Earth Crystal iodine experience, the iodine conspiracy, what they're trying to keep you from, believe me, just like our information is powerful, products I promote are powerful.
[02:08:16.576 --> 02:08:20.218]  I would not sell something or do something that isn't amazing.
[02:08:20.778 --> 02:08:26.702]  That's why when we sell a silver coin or a gold bar for three times the markup, I tell you, this is a markup.
[02:08:28.294 --> 02:08:29.075]  It's a work of art.
[02:08:29.135 --> 02:08:30.015]  We need the extra money.
[02:08:30.355 --> 02:08:31.996]  Well, the supplements, there's barely markup.
[02:08:32.036 --> 02:08:32.817]  They're incredible deals.
[02:08:33.137 --> 02:08:34.578]  T-shirts, books, films, you name it.
[02:08:35.038 --> 02:08:35.939]  Very low prices.
[02:08:35.979 --> 02:08:36.919]  We sell storable food.
[02:08:38.400 --> 02:08:41.402]  I make a 30% on that because it's a good food at a low price.
[02:08:42.383 --> 02:08:49.867]  So we'll tell you when something is purely to keep us on air or when it's something that's really going to fund what you're doing and support you.
[02:08:51.445 --> 02:08:53.066]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:08:56.847 --> 02:09:02.410]  We have the great little gold bars with the little art piece that comes with them, up to 50% off when you get three or more of them.
[02:09:03.070 --> 02:09:04.531]  We have X2 back in stock.
[02:09:05.231 --> 02:09:07.512]  It's all there at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:09:07.532 --> 02:09:09.773]  We cannot stay on air without you.
[02:09:09.813 --> 02:09:11.293]  With you, we are unstoppable.
[02:09:11.734 --> 02:09:14.115]  Our most important work is happening now.
[02:09:15.015 --> 02:09:23.464]  And so again, I respectfully ask you to pray for us, spread the word, and buy the products at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:09:24.124 --> 02:09:28.829]  They can answer all your questions, take your orders via the phone as well, if you'd like to do it that way.
[02:09:28.849 --> 02:09:29.289]  888-253-3139.
[02:09:29.309 --> 02:09:29.369]  888-253-3139.
[02:09:29.450 --> 02:09:32.132]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root takes over.
[02:09:31.952 --> 02:09:38.092]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root takes over.
[02:09:38.092 --> 02:09:40.012]  Stay with us.
[02:09:40.012 --> 02:09:47.211]   We are now into hour number four of a broadcast that exists in defiance to every tyrant on
[02:09:47.211 --> 02:09:50.212]  this planet.
[02:09:50.038 --> 02:09:51.880]  Wayne Allyn Root is always an amazing host.
[02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:55.863]  He takes over here in just a few minutes from his studios in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[02:09:56.244 --> 02:10:00.207]  I come to you from the ATX in the center of the rebellion.
[02:10:00.227 --> 02:10:04.971]  That's why there's so many conflicting vortexes and eddy pools here.
[02:10:05.953 --> 02:10:13.697]  Twitter goes on internal lockdown to prevent woke employees taking revenge for Elon Musk's takeover.
[02:10:14.578 --> 02:10:20.201]  Isn't that a great illustration of the Justice Department and the corporations, all of it, just mad dogs?
[02:10:21.081 --> 02:10:27.403]  Believing they're invincible, having nobody calling their bluff, doing whatever they want, whenever they want, however they want.
[02:10:27.883 --> 02:10:30.764]  Trump says, we have stupid people now running our country.
[02:10:31.184 --> 02:10:32.984]  The world is going to be blown to pieces.
[02:10:33.564 --> 02:10:40.586]  No, they're globalists that want to destroy free countries and bankrupt world currencies to bring in their new world order.
[02:10:41.367 --> 02:10:56.405]   So my biggest issue with Trump and the Republican talk show host And the rest of them is they keep acting like Biden's an idiot.
[02:10:56.725 --> 02:11:05.711]  Oh look, well he ran circles around us, he stole an election from us, he destroyed our borders, he's destroying our dollar, he's promoting pedophilia, he's telling us inflation's fine.
[02:11:06.671 --> 02:11:10.954]  Well then, oh so a dementia-ridden idiot just kicked our ass?
[02:11:10.994 --> 02:11:11.214]  No.
[02:11:11.634 --> 02:11:15.236]  He's a dementia-ridden idiot, but the people behind him are...
[02:11:17.065 --> 02:11:26.734]  Kicking our ass up and down the street, and only admitting it's conscious, only admitting it's a plan, only admitting that they know what they're doing, beats them!
[02:11:27.075 --> 02:11:30.378]  Instead of, why are they so dumb turning off the pipelines?
[02:11:30.878 --> 02:11:32.500]  Why are they getting rid of the border?
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:33.421]  Why, why, why?
[02:11:33.761 --> 02:11:38.406]  Because it's a New World Order plan in their own words.
[02:11:40.347 --> 02:11:48.612]  And nothing for me is more frustrating than knowing that and sitting here and watching it over and over and over again.
[02:11:49.212 --> 02:11:51.573]  Limbaugh before he died and all the other talk shows.
[02:11:51.813 --> 02:11:52.934]  Oh, they're morons.
[02:11:53.394 --> 02:11:57.857]  They don't know why they cut off all the energy in the U.S.
[02:11:58.057 --> 02:11:59.258]  Oh, they don't know why.
[02:12:00.818 --> 02:12:04.981]  They know exactly why and how they have done this.
[02:12:07.014 --> 02:12:11.222]  So I'll say this before Wayne Allyn Root takes over in the next hour and blows us all away as he always does.
[02:12:11.242 --> 02:12:18.996]  I am in such a frustrated mode because we are so close to victory but so far away from victory at the same time.
[02:12:19.787 --> 02:12:37.693]  And that's why I just want to remind listeners, when you take snippets out of the show, when you share them on social media, when you tell your friends and family about the broadcast, when you explain, hey, this is forbidden information that nobody is supposed to get, it has a giant effect.
[02:12:38.033 --> 02:12:40.093]  The people are ready for the truth.
[02:12:40.473 --> 02:12:41.754]  The people are awake.
[02:12:42.854 --> 02:12:46.557]  All you've got to do is carry the ball down the field.
[02:12:46.657 --> 02:12:51.141]  So, I know our general audience of millions is doing that, and that's why they fear us.
[02:12:51.581 --> 02:13:01.650]  That's why we're having such a huge effect, and that's why the Justice Department wants to indict me, and that's why the whole system's coming after me, because we have the formula for victory.
[02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:06.595]  And I'm saying I didn't do all of this to lose.
[02:13:07.075 --> 02:13:08.577]  I have bet on you.
[02:13:08.597 --> 02:13:10.279]  I believe in you.
[02:13:10.299 --> 02:13:13.222]  And I thank you for everything you've done.
[02:13:13.242 --> 02:13:17.928]  So I'm not going to tell you how to do it, but you're smart.
[02:13:19.164 --> 02:13:31.531]  However you can support InfoWars, however you can share the videos and articles, however you can share the live feeds, however you can be engaged is beautiful and we will change the world together.
[02:13:31.811 --> 02:13:37.394]  Or we can crawl in a ditch and just give up to this whole thing, which makes it ten times worse.
[02:13:37.494 --> 02:13:37.734]  No!
[02:13:38.415 --> 02:13:41.637]  For me, there's no choice in what we do now.
[02:13:41.977 --> 02:13:43.578]  There's only victory or death.
[02:13:44.698 --> 02:13:54.787]  As Colonel Travis said at the Alamo, there is only standing up and doing what's right and being committed to that or the long dark night of submission.
[02:13:54.807 --> 02:14:02.013]  As Zapata said, the great Mexican leader, it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees as a slave.
[02:14:02.454 --> 02:14:08.679]  And I will not live on my knees as a slave, but it's not some pissing contest where we die on our feet.
[02:14:08.779 --> 02:14:10.080]  We win on our feet.
[02:14:10.421 --> 02:14:11.782]  We survive on our feet.
[02:14:12.162 --> 02:14:15.665]  We save America and the world on our feet.
[02:14:16.346 --> 02:14:26.795]  Wayne Allen Root, best-selling author, syndicated columnist, talk show host, you name it, coming up straight ahead in T-minus 60 seconds.
[02:14:27.156 --> 02:14:28.137]  So what are we going to do?
[02:14:28.477 --> 02:14:29.378]  Share those links.
[02:14:29.698 --> 02:14:30.639]  Great job, crew.
[02:14:30.739 --> 02:14:32.739]  War Room in 55 minutes.
[02:14:32.739 --> 02:14:45.739]  [MUSIC]
[02:14:45.739 --> 02:14:49.739]   It's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the internet and
[02:14:49.739 --> 02:14:53.739]   mobile technology first came out, which is, we thought, this is going to level the playing field.
[02:14:54.262 --> 02:14:56.343]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information.
[02:14:56.423 --> 02:14:58.744]  Everybody's going to be able to freely communicate that information.
[02:14:59.505 --> 02:15:00.325]  That's our goal.
[02:15:00.725 --> 02:15:05.548]  To get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[02:15:05.648 --> 02:15:11.251]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever we want.
[02:15:11.829 --> 02:15:29.739]  And we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions, the people we want to talk to about these things.
[02:15:30.299 --> 02:15:35.502]  So that's our goal is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take back their privacy.
[02:15:35.823 --> 02:15:37.203]  And so that's really what we're trying to do.
[02:15:37.263 --> 02:15:43.206]   And so I hope that everybody listening We'll check us out at voltawireless.com.
[02:15:43.226 --> 02:15:45.670]  That's V-O-L-T-A-Wireless.com.
[02:15:46.050 --> 02:15:46.491]  All right!
[02:15:46.971 --> 02:15:53.820]  Wayne Allyn Root, guest hosting for Alex Jones, as I do on Tuesdays, between noon and one o'clock, most Tuesdays.
[02:15:54.841 --> 02:16:09.133]   Occasionally I have a Trip, plan, business trip or vacation or something but most Tuesdays I'm here with you now and I love to be here with you now so thank you Alex Jones for giving me this opportunity to educate all of you with some of the things I know.
[02:16:09.193 --> 02:16:17.395]  I think we all have our own special touches in life and specialties and you know mine is I'm the Paul Revere of conservatism.
[02:16:17.415 --> 02:16:26.701]   You know I don't really create anything brand new I'm the guy who screams, the commies are coming, the commies are coming, and wakes you up, and lets you know about bad things out there.
[02:16:27.201 --> 02:16:34.065]  And for the last year and almost a half, I've been screaming, the vaccines are killing you, the vaccines are killing you!
[02:16:35.125 --> 02:16:42.830]  And people don't want to listen, but the numbers are coming in fast and furious, and they prove that I was right from day one.
[02:16:43.310 --> 02:16:47.760]   The vaccines are in fact killing us, the vaccines are in fact Killing us.
[02:16:48.280 --> 02:16:48.781]  Killing you.
[02:16:49.161 --> 02:16:50.803]  Not killing me, because I'm never going to take a vaccine.
[02:16:51.183 --> 02:16:53.326]  You'll have to vaccinate me over my cold, dead hands.
[02:16:54.086 --> 02:17:01.114]  But the reality is that many conservatives took the blue pill instead of the red pill, right?
[02:17:01.693 --> 02:17:03.633]  They took it, and they got vaccinated.
[02:17:04.154 --> 02:17:05.714]  And a lot of them are paying the price now.
[02:17:05.754 --> 02:17:12.255]  I can't tell you how many I know are dying and are badly injured because of this situation.
[02:17:12.295 --> 02:17:14.736]  So I'll be talking about that during this hour.
[02:17:14.816 --> 02:17:15.656]  I'm Wayne Allen Root.
[02:17:16.196 --> 02:17:18.236]  My website's RootForAmerica.com.
[02:17:18.676 --> 02:17:20.857]  RootForAmerica.com, that's what I do all day.
[02:17:21.257 --> 02:17:23.297]  I root for this great country, root for America.
[02:17:23.757 --> 02:17:25.898]  My email's WayneRoot at gmail.com.
[02:17:26.458 --> 02:17:38.484]   And my book is The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book, The Great Patriot protest and boycott book which was the book that kind of predicted all this.
[02:17:39.164 --> 02:17:48.989]  I said a year ago when I was writing this book and maybe eight months ago when it came out, we as conservatives have got to fight back with civil disobedience like Martin Luther King.
[02:17:49.029 --> 02:17:49.990]  There it is up on the screen.
[02:17:50.550 --> 02:17:53.331]  Fight back with disobedience like Martin Luther King.
[02:17:53.371 --> 02:17:55.212]  We've got to boycott.
[02:17:55.733 --> 02:17:57.073]  We've got to protest.
[02:17:57.113 --> 02:17:58.094]  We've got to strike.
[02:17:59.153 --> 02:18:05.797]  And we got to hit them hard because these corporations are funding the destruction of America.
[02:18:06.218 --> 02:18:07.198]  And they don't listen to us.
[02:18:07.218 --> 02:18:08.319]  They only listen to liberals.
[02:18:08.899 --> 02:18:11.221]  We got to overwhelm them and knock them out of business.
[02:18:11.821 --> 02:18:12.502]  And I was right.
[02:18:12.542 --> 02:18:15.324]  And one of the companies I listed in my book is Disney.
[02:18:16.124 --> 02:18:19.826]  OK, and, you know, I had the foresight to list Disney right at the top.
[02:18:20.587 --> 02:18:26.831]  Disney is the worst corporation, the worst woke corporation in America that's ruining our country.
[02:18:27.672 --> 02:18:29.453]  And everybody now knows it.
[02:18:29.773 --> 02:18:31.454]  I'm not alone in the wilderness anymore.
[02:18:31.874 --> 02:18:33.675]  The tree didn't fall and nobody saw it.
[02:18:34.375 --> 02:18:37.097]  Disney's the enemy, public enemy number one.
[02:18:37.637 --> 02:18:50.828]   And as I said, I think on last week's show, guest hosting for Alex, we have got to, all of us, focus on one company, Disney, And put them out of business, bring them to their knees, destroy their business.
[02:18:50.868 --> 02:19:01.157]  I guess you can never put a multi-billion dollar multinational company like Disney completely out of business, but we can hurt them badly to the point where they scream for mercy.
[02:19:01.798 --> 02:19:11.246]  And so instead of worrying about the 116 companies I listed in my book and all their CEOs and all their CEOs' contact information, go after one company, Disney.
[02:19:11.706 --> 02:19:12.747]  That's point number one.
[02:19:13.348 --> 02:19:20.315]  Point number two, yes, there's my book, The Great Patriot Protest, the boycott book, but that was only about stop buying their products.
[02:19:20.795 --> 02:19:21.836]  Boycott their products.
[02:19:21.876 --> 02:19:23.338]  Now I've come up with a new idea.
[02:19:23.858 --> 02:19:25.240]  Boycott their stocks.
[02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:40.590]   Let's all bankrupt all the woke companies because the middle class of America, the great American middle class, Has all the money in our IRAs and SEP IRAs and PEOs and pension funds.
[02:19:41.151 --> 02:19:58.575]  And if we choose to keep our money only in companies that stay out of politics or are on our team, patriotic companies, and we take all of our money out of the coming woke companies, we can bankrupt and bring them all to their knees, destroy them.
[02:19:59.580 --> 02:20:01.202]  Because you know how shareholders are.
[02:20:01.222 --> 02:20:02.865]  I don't care how liberal you are.
[02:20:03.225 --> 02:20:10.495]  If you're a shareholder in Disney, and it lost $50 billion in value almost overnight, you're going to be screaming.
[02:20:10.896 --> 02:20:16.163]  Disney has a nightmare on their hand, a five alarm fire, and every shareholder's screaming.
[02:20:16.829 --> 02:20:19.531]  Get the F out of politics, you morons!
[02:20:20.032 --> 02:20:21.053]  Fire the CEO!
[02:20:21.393 --> 02:20:22.654]  Fire the chairman of the board!
[02:20:23.034 --> 02:20:31.561]  Fire that lady who heads the television division of Disney with the two children that are transsexual, transgender, and pansexual!
[02:20:31.942 --> 02:20:35.004]  These are crazy people with mental illness!
[02:20:35.645 --> 02:20:40.749]  They need a hug from mommy, and a straitjacket, and a visit to a rubber room!
[02:20:41.550 --> 02:20:44.132]  And you gotta drive them out of business and fire them all!
[02:20:44.784 --> 02:20:53.413]  And the way to do that is to destroy their stock at the same time as we're not buying their products and we're boycotting their theme parks and dropping them on TV.
[02:20:53.834 --> 02:20:54.775]  But it's not just Disney.
[02:20:55.175 --> 02:20:57.097]  Aim everything at Disney as far as the boycott.
[02:20:57.458 --> 02:21:03.284]  But let's go after our IRA accounts and pick out the companies that are woke and sell the stock.
[02:21:03.664 --> 02:21:04.806]  We'll destroy them all.
[02:21:05.306 --> 02:21:06.768]  We've got the power.
[02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:20.401]  Now, remember, my book is The Great Patriot Protest, a boycott book that identifies the most woke companies in America, 116 of them, including Disney, plus 115 others, and gives you all their contact information.
[02:21:20.781 --> 02:21:26.046]  And you can look up their stock at Fox Business or CNBC, and you can get it out of your account.
[02:21:26.804 --> 02:21:28.625]  It's time to double down!
[02:21:29.165 --> 02:21:30.926]  Time to send the cavalry in!
[02:21:31.487 --> 02:21:32.927]  Drive them out of business!
[02:21:33.248 --> 02:21:34.568]  What's the proof I'm right?
[02:21:35.069 --> 02:21:35.589]  Twitter!
[02:21:36.129 --> 02:21:36.810]  We're winning!
[02:21:37.430 --> 02:21:38.410]  Victory!
[02:21:38.430 --> 02:21:48.436]  I think I said this on last week's show, at the fact that Elon Musk had said he had raised the money to potentially buy Twitter, and I said, VICTORY!
[02:21:49.296 --> 02:21:50.797]  But he's done it now!
[02:21:51.518 --> 02:21:53.879]  And overnight, some accounts were restored!
[02:21:54.594 --> 02:22:00.655]  Tucker Carlson and the Babylon Bee were restored overnight, but I don't think either one was suspended for life.
[02:22:00.695 --> 02:22:03.116]  They were both under temporary suspension.
[02:22:03.636 --> 02:22:07.797]  I, Wayne Root, am banned for life, like Alex Jones is banned for life.
[02:22:08.417 --> 02:22:11.838]  Like Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit is banned for life.
[02:22:13.078 --> 02:22:16.199]  Donald Trump is banned for life, but he doesn't want on ever again.
[02:22:16.619 --> 02:22:21.060]  Trump says he's never getting on again, so it doesn't matter, because he's got his own competitor, Truth Social.
[02:22:21.707 --> 02:22:22.627]  But I want on!
[02:22:23.148 --> 02:22:34.432]  I want every platform possible to get my message out there, and I don't own a competing company that could make me billions of dollars in both profits and stock gains, stock increases.
[02:22:34.792 --> 02:22:38.253]  So I understand why Trump doesn't want on, but I want back on Twitter.
[02:22:38.273 --> 02:22:39.814]  So I applied overnight.
[02:22:40.274 --> 02:22:52.998]   I appealed my suspension overnight to Twitter and said with new ownership, Elon Musk, Who demands free speech and who demands an end to banning and censorship and shadow banning.
[02:22:53.578 --> 02:22:57.499]  I demand reinstatement of my account at Real Wayne Root.
[02:22:57.899 --> 02:22:59.739]  They have not answered yet, but we shall see.
[02:23:00.179 --> 02:23:02.560]  But the point is, the world is changing.
[02:23:02.940 --> 02:23:03.680]  We're winning.
[02:23:04.180 --> 02:23:05.241]  Hashtag winning.
[02:23:05.881 --> 02:23:06.781]  Victory!
[02:23:08.021 --> 02:23:09.201]  Thank you, Elon Musk.
[02:23:09.602 --> 02:23:11.142]  The Twitter board folded.
[02:23:11.922 --> 02:23:15.423]  And Elon Musk is now the proud owner of Twitter.
[02:23:16.494 --> 02:23:21.097]  Now, what's interesting is the Babylon Bee came out with a story today.
[02:23:21.497 --> 02:23:22.618]  Twitter's going to hate this one.
[02:23:23.319 --> 02:23:30.103]  Musk's Twitter purchase fails after 138,000 board votes are found overnight.
[02:23:31.004 --> 02:23:32.865]  You know, the Babylon Bee is a parody site.
[02:23:33.225 --> 02:23:35.547]  You know, it's the conservative version of Saturday Night Live.
[02:23:36.127 --> 02:23:36.687]  It's funny.
[02:23:37.128 --> 02:23:38.569]  So they're just joking around.
[02:23:39.029 --> 02:23:59.497]   But what they're pointing out is that the election was in fact stolen and that you can't be so dumb That you actually believe that they found millions of ballots overnight with Trump in the lead by a mile in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Michigan, and of course Arizona, Nevada.
[02:23:59.817 --> 02:24:02.118]  All six states were stolen, clearly.
[02:24:02.438 --> 02:24:09.781]  But those four, Trump was ahead by literally hundreds of thousands of votes, and overnight they found new votes.
[02:24:10.341 --> 02:24:11.722]  You know, I used to compare it to football.
[02:24:12.262 --> 02:24:13.343]  Because I'm a football guy.
[02:24:13.383 --> 02:24:14.623]  Always have been, always will be.
[02:24:14.944 --> 02:24:15.724]  I played football.
[02:24:15.744 --> 02:24:16.344]  I was good at it.
[02:24:16.765 --> 02:24:17.565]  I was a hard hitter.
[02:24:17.925 --> 02:24:19.566]  Hard-hitting safety and monster back.
[02:24:20.687 --> 02:24:23.388]  And, uh, I use things in football terms, right?
[02:24:23.448 --> 02:24:27.991]  If you watched Monday Night Football and you lost the game, you saw it with your own eyes.
[02:24:28.351 --> 02:24:28.831]  You lost.
[02:24:28.871 --> 02:24:39.517]  And then overnight, when you woke up in the morning, they announced you won because they found 14 extra points in the locker room with no referees present and they gave the victory to your team and you won.
[02:24:39.537 --> 02:24:40.338]  Would you believe that?
[02:24:41.013 --> 02:24:42.494]  That's what happened in the election.
[02:24:42.834 --> 02:25:02.941]  They stole it from Trump and they're asking you to be a moron, an ignorant sheep, and believe that they happen to find hundreds of thousands of fake fraudulent mail-in ballots with no signature verification and no voter ID overnight in the four states where he was winning by a mile that would have won him an electoral landslide.
[02:25:03.261 --> 02:25:10.805]   When you flip him the other way, he loses in a big electoral Not really a landslide, but a pretty bad loss, instead of a pretty big win.
[02:25:11.225 --> 02:25:13.706]  It's a total flip, because they found votes overnight.
[02:25:14.387 --> 02:25:17.789]  And the Babylon Bee is saying Elon Musk won, but oops, no he didn't.
[02:25:18.170 --> 02:25:21.592]  They found all new board votes overnight, and now he lost.
[02:25:22.793 --> 02:25:25.074]  That's, they're trying to laugh at the election.
[02:25:25.715 --> 02:25:26.435]  Trump won.
[02:25:26.996 --> 02:25:28.477]  Thank God Elon Musk won.
[02:25:28.877 --> 02:25:30.278]  They didn't find votes overnight.
[02:25:31.379 --> 02:25:31.879]  Be right back.
[02:25:32.583 --> 02:25:33.264]  Hi, Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:25:33.285 --> 02:25:34.827]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:35.028 --> 02:25:37.332]  I am Wayne Allyn Root, otherwise known as War.
[02:25:37.773 --> 02:25:39.537]  My website, RootForAmerican.com.
[02:25:39.917 --> 02:25:41.059]  You can email me anytime.
[02:25:41.832 --> 02:25:43.893]  Wayne Root at gmail.com.
[02:25:43.933 --> 02:25:45.473]  Wayne Root at gmail.com.
[02:25:45.533 --> 02:25:48.374]  And hopefully, I'm back on Twitter very soon.
[02:25:48.394 --> 02:25:51.055]  I was banned for life in January of last year.
[02:25:51.775 --> 02:25:54.355]  Had over 150,000 fans.
[02:25:54.836 --> 02:25:57.296]  More importantly, I picked up 80,000 of them.
[02:25:57.696 --> 02:25:59.097]  I just looked it up to confirm that.
[02:25:59.477 --> 02:26:04.818]  I picked up 80,000 new fans in about two months around the election in 2020.
[02:26:05.518 --> 02:26:06.359]  October, November.
[02:26:06.379 --> 02:26:08.719]  80,000 new fans.
[02:26:08.739 --> 02:26:09.159]  40,000 a month.
[02:26:09.860 --> 02:26:11.200]  And Twitter must have panicked.
[02:26:11.795 --> 02:26:16.296]  Those little snowflake losers must have panicked.
[02:26:16.317 --> 02:26:27.020]  Little snowflake communist losers got so scared and angry that I was winning on their platform and gaining $40,000 a month and they banned me for life right after that.
[02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:34.382]  So now with Elon Musk in charge, I certainly believe I will be back and Alex Jones will be back.
[02:26:34.422 --> 02:26:37.023]  Donald Trump should be back, but he doesn't want to be back.
[02:26:37.764 --> 02:26:39.044]  He's sticking to truth social.
[02:26:40.001 --> 02:26:41.384]  Let me mention a couple things.
[02:26:41.504 --> 02:26:45.570]  So, number one, I want to bring up the NFL.
[02:26:45.610 --> 02:26:48.435]  And I know most of you are not big sports fans or football fans.
[02:26:48.775 --> 02:26:50.598]  You don't tune into Alex Jones for NFL.
[02:26:51.459 --> 02:26:53.603]  But I want to make a connection here.
[02:26:54.352 --> 02:26:57.473]  Because I'm someone who has never liked experts.
[02:26:58.134 --> 02:27:03.316]  I think experts are, you know, I've never even asked anybody, any of the producers, Alex Jones, if I'm allowed to curse.
[02:27:03.396 --> 02:27:03.756]  I won't.
[02:27:04.216 --> 02:27:05.676]  But experts are full of crap.
[02:27:05.736 --> 02:27:06.217]  How about that?
[02:27:06.237 --> 02:27:09.318]  Instead of the word I really wanted to use that begins with S.H.
[02:27:09.938 --> 02:27:11.299]  Experts are full of crap.
[02:27:11.859 --> 02:27:13.660]  Experts are never right on TV.
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.381]  They're always wrong, which is why I never call myself an expert.
[02:27:17.801 --> 02:27:22.243]  What I am on TV is a common sense guy, a son of a butcher.
[02:27:22.737 --> 02:27:28.941]  A common sense guy with middle class gut instincts and common sense, that's almost always right.
[02:27:29.321 --> 02:27:34.884]  I've got my finger on the pulse of what the average middle class American is thinking.
[02:27:35.524 --> 02:27:36.925]  And that is always right.
[02:27:37.025 --> 02:27:44.310]  Middle class people have more common sense in their thumb than an Ivy League lawyer or doctor or engineer has in their entire body.
[02:27:45.430 --> 02:27:47.271]  And I can say that because I'm an Ivy Leaguer, right?
[02:27:47.310 --> 02:27:52.710]   I went to Columbia University, class of '83 with my classmate who was never seen there,
[02:27:52.710 --> 02:28:00.870]   Barack Hussein Obama, class of '83, my invisible ghost classmate, aka the Manchurian candidate.
[02:28:00.870 --> 02:28:04.431]   And so I went to an Ivy League school, graduated from an Ivy League school.
[02:28:04.431 --> 02:28:07.550]   By the way, most kids today take six years to graduate college.
[02:28:07.550 --> 02:28:10.950]  I graduated the Ivy League school in three and a half years.
[02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:15.870]  So I know Ivy Leaguers and I am an Ivy League educated guy.
[02:28:15.870 --> 02:28:20.950]   And the people I went to school with were book smart and test smart, but had no common
[02:28:20.950 --> 02:28:23.870]  sense and were always wrong on every issue.
[02:28:24.246 --> 02:28:32.610]  That explains Biden, Obama, Kerry, Clinton, every liberal out there always wrong on every issue, over-educated eggheads.
[02:28:34.335 --> 02:28:39.998]  And the reason I bring up the NFL for this experts segment, because this is what this segment's about, experts.
[02:28:40.398 --> 02:28:41.479]  Don't listen to experts.
[02:28:42.239 --> 02:28:48.463]  So I was on one of my favorite sports websites today, and they had an article about my Dallas Cowboys.
[02:28:48.503 --> 02:28:50.164]  I'm a huge Dallas Cowboy fan.
[02:28:50.184 --> 02:28:52.105]  I think you might be able to see the helmet right behind me.
[02:28:52.565 --> 02:28:54.806]  If you can't, my big head's probably in the way.
[02:28:55.166 --> 02:28:57.167]  But I'm a huge Dallas Cowboy fan.
[02:28:57.808 --> 02:29:03.631]  And they had an article about the last 10 years, who the Dallas Cowboys drafted in the first round.
[02:29:04.264 --> 02:29:32.972]   Compared to the two biggest draft experts in the world, Mel Kiper and Todd McShay, who evidently make millions and millions of dollars studying every college football player coming out of college, and who should draft them, and what their needs are, and how good they are, and what their weaknesses are, and they know everything in their walking encyclopedias, and Mel Kiper is now 60 years old, And he's been doing this since he was 16.
[02:29:33.492 --> 02:29:37.173]  He's an expert on the NFL Draft and a walking encyclopedia.
[02:29:37.513 --> 02:29:43.455]  And he's built a multi-million dollar, probably a hundred million dollar fortune, I would guess, by being the expert.
[02:29:43.555 --> 02:29:45.835]  Every team uses him as an advisor.
[02:29:45.855 --> 02:29:50.737]  The ESPN uses him all year long to talk about the draft upcoming.
[02:29:51.057 --> 02:29:54.678]  And then draft week, he's the go-to expert in the entire world.
[02:29:55.666 --> 02:29:58.128]  And they compared his picks each year.
[02:29:58.208 --> 02:30:00.610]  He makes his own picks who each team should take in the first round.
[02:30:01.171 --> 02:30:05.554]  If the Dallas Cowboys had taken his picks the last 10 years versus what they did.
[02:30:06.255 --> 02:30:15.042]  So what they did, what Dallas actually chose in the first round, makes them the third most successful team out of 32 NFL teams in the last 10 years.
[02:30:15.803 --> 02:30:16.103]  Okay?
[02:30:16.283 --> 02:30:17.885]  Third out of 32 teams.
[02:30:18.005 --> 02:30:18.746]  Pretty damn good.
[02:30:19.466 --> 02:30:23.209]  What this great expert Mel Kiper did would put them at 24th.
[02:30:24.875 --> 02:30:25.195]  Okay?
[02:30:25.695 --> 02:30:26.975]  Experts are morons.
[02:30:27.295 --> 02:30:27.976]  They know nothing.
[02:30:28.416 --> 02:30:31.936]  Todd McShay is Mel Kuyper's sidekick on ESPN.
[02:30:32.316 --> 02:30:34.577]  He lives and breathes drafts all year long.
[02:30:35.097 --> 02:30:46.259]  His picks were put side-by-side for the last 10 years, and much better than Mel Kuyper's, who's supposed to be the expert, but his picks would have left the Dallas Cowboys 10th out of all 32 teams.
[02:30:47.079 --> 02:30:57.805]   So instead of third, they would have been either 24th or 10th, which goes to show you That even the world's biggest experts don't know... I'll say crap again.
[02:30:58.265 --> 02:30:59.246]  They don't know SH.
[02:30:59.366 --> 02:31:00.046]  You know that word?
[02:31:00.406 --> 02:31:01.127]  They don't know any of it.
[02:31:02.547 --> 02:31:03.388]  They're always wrong.
[02:31:04.008 --> 02:31:08.911]  And I bring that up to compare it to the experts in the medical field.
[02:31:10.551 --> 02:31:17.075]  Because in the last couple weeks, I've talked to a lot of friends of mine who have taken the vaccines and are very sick.
[02:31:17.975 --> 02:31:21.057]  And every one of them, when I say, why did you take the vaccine?
[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:22.741]  They all say the same thing.
[02:31:22.781 --> 02:31:23.982]  My doctor told me I have to.
[02:31:26.083 --> 02:31:31.147]  My doctor not only told me I'd take the first two, but my doctor said, you got to take the booster.
[02:31:31.968 --> 02:31:36.832]  And now we see in the news today, Kamala Harris has COVID.
[02:31:37.573 --> 02:31:40.735]  She's been double vaxxed and double boosted.
[02:31:41.236 --> 02:31:44.378]  And she's now has COVID and she's in quarantine.
[02:31:46.039 --> 02:31:56.078]   We saw in the news today that the NFL draft that's happening on Thursday, One of the other big college football experts in the world is Kirk Herbstreit.
[02:31:57.258 --> 02:31:59.139]  And he's got a huge name.
[02:31:59.179 --> 02:32:02.821]  He's considered a superstar of college football broadcasting.
[02:32:03.141 --> 02:32:04.901]  My guess, he makes like $10 million a year.
[02:32:05.742 --> 02:32:06.842]  He's not coming to Vegas.
[02:32:07.022 --> 02:32:07.522]  That's where it is.
[02:32:07.542 --> 02:32:13.184]  In Vegas, starting on Thursday, my town right here, Vegas, about a million people are coming to town.
[02:32:13.545 --> 02:32:15.225]  The most in the history of Las Vegas.
[02:32:15.245 --> 02:32:18.046]  It's gonna be the worst traffic nightmare in the history of our town.
[02:32:18.927 --> 02:32:23.178]   And it's gonna be like, Three Super Bowls combined with New Year's Eve.
[02:32:23.859 --> 02:32:25.940]  That's how popular the NFL Draft has become.
[02:32:26.300 --> 02:32:28.361]  And everybody wants to see it in Vegas.
[02:32:28.701 --> 02:32:32.984]  It's an excuse to visit beautiful Vegas Strip, which is one of the funnest places in the world.
[02:32:33.364 --> 02:32:39.947]  This is the adult version of Disneyland without the transsexual education and the sexual identity brainwashing.
[02:32:40.448 --> 02:32:43.449]  So everybody who loves football, loves Vegas and gambling.
[02:32:43.770 --> 02:32:44.710]  So they're all coming here.
[02:32:44.970 --> 02:32:46.211]  This is the Mecca this year.
[02:32:46.949 --> 02:32:47.990]  But guess who isn't coming?
[02:32:48.290 --> 02:32:56.454]  Herb Kirkstreet, the big expert from ESPN, is not coming because he's vaccinated and he got a blood clot.
[02:32:57.755 --> 02:32:58.715]  Can't get it on an airplane.
[02:32:59.256 --> 02:33:01.757]  Nowhere in the article does it blame the vaccine.
[02:33:02.423 --> 02:33:06.849]  But we know he's vaccinated because you can't work at ESPN unless you're vaccinated.
[02:33:07.409 --> 02:33:09.352]  Nowhere in the articles it mentions he's vaccinated.
[02:33:09.652 --> 02:33:12.215]  I'm sure he's triple-vaxxed, including boosted.
[02:33:12.516 --> 02:33:14.358]  Nowhere in the articles it blames the vaccine.
[02:33:14.798 --> 02:33:15.760]  Same thing with Kamala.
[02:33:16.040 --> 02:33:17.462]  Double-vaxxed, double-boosted.
[02:33:17.742 --> 02:33:18.423]  She has COVID.
[02:33:18.883 --> 02:33:19.965]  Folks, the history of the world.
[02:33:20.563 --> 02:33:25.487]  Imagine if I told you somebody took four polio shots and they got polio.
[02:33:25.867 --> 02:33:26.828]  But that means it works.
[02:33:27.689 --> 02:33:31.171]  That's the argument that medical experts are trying to give you.
[02:33:31.571 --> 02:33:40.799]  That if you took three or four shots to stop from getting COVID, but now you have COVID, that's the proof it works because you're not dying of COVID.
[02:33:41.139 --> 02:33:44.261]  Folks, I never got vaccinated, and I'm not dying of COVID.
[02:33:44.662 --> 02:33:50.126]  The fact is, if you got vaccinated, you shouldn't be getting COVID, or COVID's vaccine's a miserable failure.
[02:33:50.706 --> 02:33:52.847]  Kirk Herbstreet has a blood clot!
[02:33:53.227 --> 02:33:55.309]  It's obvious it's because he got vaccinated.
[02:33:55.689 --> 02:33:56.789]  Anyone could figure that out.
[02:33:57.350 --> 02:33:58.950]  I'll have a lot more to tell you when I get back.
[02:33:59.491 --> 02:34:04.673]  Wade Alleyroot, website, rootforamerica.com, R-O-O-T, rootforamerica.com.
[02:34:05.874 --> 02:34:07.835]  My email, waderoot at gmail.com.
[02:34:08.235 --> 02:34:10.577]  And my book, The Great Patriot Protest, a boycott book.
[02:34:11.177 --> 02:34:12.257]  We'll be back in a minute.
[02:34:12.738 --> 02:34:14.919]  All right, Wade Alleyroot, welcome back, guest host.
[02:34:15.754 --> 02:34:18.656]  For Tuesdays, noon to one o'clock West Coast time.
[02:34:18.676 --> 02:34:21.479]  So that means three o'clock to four o'clock East Coast time.
[02:34:21.559 --> 02:34:23.680]  Alex Jones, guest host, Wade Elroot.
[02:34:23.901 --> 02:34:24.341]  How are you?
[02:34:24.801 --> 02:34:25.482]  Great to be with you.
[02:34:26.142 --> 02:34:29.865]  Fantastic to be with you on this day where we're actually winning a little bit.
[02:34:29.885 --> 02:34:33.388]  I wrote a column back last Friday.
[02:34:33.408 --> 02:34:35.170]  So I only do this show on Tuesdays with you.
[02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:36.771]  So you don't even hear the column.
[02:34:36.791 --> 02:34:38.172]  The column was hashtag winning.
[02:34:38.692 --> 02:34:43.696]  We have the three D's, Disney, Democrats and the devil on the run.
[02:34:43.736 --> 02:34:44.357]  What a great week.
[02:34:44.992 --> 02:34:46.693]  And I just want to give you a review of the highlights.
[02:34:47.193 --> 02:34:55.315]  Last week, Disney, sinking faster than Titanic, lost $50 billion in market share, or I should say in stock market value.
[02:34:55.915 --> 02:35:00.917]  Netflix, crushed on Wall Street, lost $35 billion in stock value.
[02:35:00.977 --> 02:35:03.057]  CNN Plus, out of business.
[02:35:03.537 --> 02:35:04.078]  CNN lost $300 million.
[02:35:06.058 --> 02:35:10.980]  I don't know how you could spend $300 million on a streaming service and hire a bunch of liberal losers.
[02:35:11.380 --> 02:35:14.041]  They must give each one of them $30 million upfront or something.
[02:35:14.381 --> 02:35:21.404]  Biggest bunch of losers I've ever seen that look lousy on TV and can't even speak well, no personality.
[02:35:21.985 --> 02:35:25.946]  Dour, negative, commie losers who hate America.
[02:35:26.427 --> 02:35:33.349]  Proving once again that you can't find success peeing on America.
[02:35:33.549 --> 02:35:34.630]  I have no other way to say it.
[02:35:35.293 --> 02:35:36.174]  Peeing on America.
[02:35:36.554 --> 02:35:43.959]  If all you do is attack America and denigrate America, and say America's evil and all white people are evil, there's nobody to watch your show.
[02:35:44.719 --> 02:35:45.800]  CNN Plus, gone.
[02:35:46.300 --> 02:35:47.621]  Can't wait for CNN to be gone.
[02:35:48.201 --> 02:35:49.882]  The mask mandates are gone.
[02:35:50.262 --> 02:35:51.463]  Another huge victory.
[02:35:51.563 --> 02:35:52.124]  Victory!
[02:35:52.604 --> 02:35:53.625]  Mask mandate's gone.
[02:35:55.346 --> 02:35:59.728]  And then I said Elon Musk has enough money, it appears, to buy Twitter, and that came true.
[02:36:00.269 --> 02:36:03.651]  And then I said Spotify parted ways with Obama.
[02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:11.826]  And the Obamas, Michelle and Barack, and they didn't say it like we fired them.
[02:36:11.887 --> 02:36:23.417]  Of course, they're all liberals, so they're never going to say we fired the Obamas because they suck on TV, which they do, and because they're boring, which they are, and because nobody watched, which they didn't.
[02:36:23.817 --> 02:36:25.198]  They just said we parted ways.
[02:36:25.638 --> 02:36:28.381]  But the Obamas got fired by Spotify.
[02:36:29.051 --> 02:36:34.174]  Barack Obama is the most boring human being that ever lived, unless a brilliant guy writes speeches for him.
[02:36:34.555 --> 02:36:37.016]  You realize I give speeches every day and get standing ovations.
[02:36:37.356 --> 02:36:46.162]  I was with Donald Trump, Donald J. Trump, and it was a Wayne Root, Donald Trump event, Club 45 in Florida, Palm Beach, Florida, two weeks ago.
[02:36:46.742 --> 02:36:50.545]  And I got a standing ovation, and I write my own speeches.
[02:36:51.306 --> 02:36:58.331]  Obama had the most brilliant speech writers in the world writing his speeches for him to try and sound interesting.
[02:36:58.731 --> 02:37:01.533]  But anytime he went off on his own, he was boring.
[02:37:03.055 --> 02:37:05.516]  My national three-hour radio show is exciting.
[02:37:05.977 --> 02:37:06.937]  It's like this show.
[02:37:07.338 --> 02:37:08.278]  It's high energy.
[02:37:08.579 --> 02:37:13.562]  Balls to the walls, pedal to the metal, three hours in a row of me with this kind of energy.
[02:37:14.323 --> 02:37:16.264]  Barack Obama doesn't have it.
[02:37:17.025 --> 02:37:17.985]  He's boring.
[02:37:18.786 --> 02:37:20.027]  He's a boring old man.
[02:37:20.808 --> 02:37:22.349]  Same age as me, but I'm a young man.
[02:37:23.049 --> 02:37:23.629]  He's boring.
[02:37:23.989 --> 02:37:25.030]  Presidency burned him out.
[02:37:25.690 --> 02:37:30.092]  It's hard to be a communist all day long and be negative to the greatest country in the world.
[02:37:30.552 --> 02:37:32.272]  Takes a lot away from you, you know?
[02:37:33.253 --> 02:37:34.593]  And to fake who you are.
[02:37:34.993 --> 02:37:38.235]  Obama tried to act like a moderate, straight male.
[02:37:39.395 --> 02:37:40.636]  If you get what I'm trying to say.
[02:37:41.236 --> 02:37:42.556]  Obama faked it all.
[02:37:43.077 --> 02:37:45.177]  It's hard to fake who you are all day long.
[02:37:45.557 --> 02:37:47.498]  To hide in the closet, Obama.
[02:37:48.719 --> 02:37:49.479]  Alright, um...
[02:37:50.208 --> 02:37:57.025]  I mentioned a couple other things in my column about the good news, the good things happening last week, and then I'll update it for this week.
[02:37:58.150 --> 02:38:05.637]  I added in some terrible news, but I still called it positive news, because if it can lead to good, it's okay.
[02:38:05.657 --> 02:38:06.958]  Think about an airplane crash.
[02:38:07.418 --> 02:38:09.079]  Most people would say, Wayne Root's crazy.
[02:38:09.340 --> 02:38:13.123]  There's nothing positive when an airplane crashes and 300 people die.
[02:38:13.703 --> 02:38:15.605]  Au contraire, I disagree with you.
[02:38:16.065 --> 02:38:18.928]  There's something called the black box, okay?
[02:38:19.268 --> 02:38:25.183]   And every word That said, by the two pilots, is copied on that black box, transcribed.
[02:38:25.744 --> 02:38:30.588]  And all the mechanical workings of the plane are transcribed on that black box.
[02:38:30.608 --> 02:38:36.093]  So if they could find it after the crash, which they do in almost every case ever, they always find it.
[02:38:36.113 --> 02:38:37.554]  It's indestructible, the black box.
[02:38:38.035 --> 02:38:43.500]  And after much searching in the middle of the ocean, in the deep blue ocean, they find the black box.
[02:38:44.221 --> 02:38:48.222]  That black box holds the key so that the crash never happens again.
[02:38:48.703 --> 02:38:50.703]  So those 300 people didn't die in vain.
[02:38:51.144 --> 02:38:53.945]  They quite possibly save thousands in the future.
[02:38:53.965 --> 02:38:55.765]  Their life was not for nothing.
[02:38:56.125 --> 02:39:03.428]  They died for a reason and it's going to save many thousands in the future if you can figure out what really happened and prevent it from happening again.
[02:39:03.468 --> 02:39:05.529]  And the only way to do that is with the black box.
[02:39:06.966 --> 02:39:13.028]  A couple of things that happened last week were negative, but I call them positive because they can lead to change, positive change.
[02:39:13.628 --> 02:39:20.150]  Number one, we found out after I've been warning for almost a year and a half now that like Paul Revere, right?
[02:39:20.210 --> 02:39:21.430]  I'm the conservative Paul Revere.
[02:39:21.890 --> 02:39:23.030]  Wayne Allyn Root is Paul Revere.
[02:39:23.590 --> 02:39:24.991]  The vaccines are killing us.
[02:39:28.212 --> 02:39:28.972]  I'm Paul Revere.
[02:39:29.824 --> 02:39:31.584]  And what did we find out last week?
[02:39:32.105 --> 02:39:37.686]  Deaths among Millennials are up 84% since the vaccines.
[02:39:37.706 --> 02:39:37.686]  84%.
[02:39:38.906 --> 02:39:44.508]  Now, lest you think it's a small number because Millennials are so young and generally fit, they don't die.
[02:39:45.028 --> 02:39:49.449]  So maybe you're thinking, well, usually a thousand people die, and instead 1,500 died, and that's up 84%.
[02:39:49.749 --> 02:40:01.332]   No, actually, Edward Dowd is a brilliant hedge fund manager who managed in the past as much as $18 billion for BlackRock.
[02:40:01.372 --> 02:40:08.998]  He was a guest on my national radio show last week, Wayne Allyn Root-Raw and Unfiltered, on USA Radio Network every afternoon from 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:40:09.038 --> 02:40:09.958]  West Coast, 5 to 8 p.m.
[02:40:11.139 --> 02:40:12.921]  Central time and 6 to 9 p.m.
[02:40:13.001 --> 02:40:13.681]  East Coast time.
[02:40:14.021 --> 02:40:28.013]  You can find it at root4america.com, my website, right at the top, or you can go to usaradio.com, or you can go to Odyssey, now carries my show, the number one streaming service in the world for radio.
[02:40:28.613 --> 02:40:29.914]  40 million people stream radio.
[02:40:30.835 --> 02:40:32.056]  Is our screen frozen right now?
[02:40:32.076 --> 02:40:32.996]  It seems like we're frozen.
[02:40:34.213 --> 02:40:35.174]  There we go, I'm back again.
[02:40:35.294 --> 02:40:36.074]  Am I back on again?
[02:40:36.414 --> 02:40:37.315]  Yes, back on again.
[02:40:37.555 --> 02:40:40.956]  We lost you guys for a minute on Skype, but we're back on again.
[02:40:41.596 --> 02:40:52.562]  So, Odyssey is another place you can listen to my national radio show, but I had Ed Dowd on my show, I think it was last week or maybe the tail end of the week before, and he was talking about Vietnam.
[02:40:52.582 --> 02:40:53.942]  We lost 60,000-plus Americans.
[02:40:56.279 --> 02:40:56.580]  60,000 plus.
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:40:58.261]  I don't know the exact number offhand.
[02:40:59.001 --> 02:41:02.384]  60 to 70,000 great American boys died.
[02:41:02.444 --> 02:41:03.985]  And it's so sad to even mention that.
[02:41:04.466 --> 02:41:07.708]  God, I can't stand seeing a soldier or a law enforcement person ever die.
[02:41:08.188 --> 02:41:09.029]  There's such heroes.
[02:41:09.049 --> 02:41:09.970]  There's such good people.
[02:41:10.310 --> 02:41:11.431]  And they're willing to die for us.
[02:41:11.491 --> 02:41:13.212]  And when they do, it's just the worst thing in the world.
[02:41:14.133 --> 02:41:16.455]  60,000 plus Americans died in 10 years of Vietnam.
[02:41:17.055 --> 02:41:17.495]  Right?
[02:41:17.555 --> 02:41:24.699]  We started Vietnam in the early 60s under John F. Kennedy, and it didn't end until the early 70s under Richard Nixon.
[02:41:24.719 --> 02:41:25.980]  60,000 plus American boys died.
[02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:27.421]  I don't think it's boys and girls.
[02:41:27.441 --> 02:41:29.342]  In those days, there were no women at the front.
[02:41:29.442 --> 02:41:30.062]  Women didn't die.
[02:41:30.142 --> 02:41:32.243]  It was men who sacrificed their lives.
[02:41:34.104 --> 02:41:43.552]   And Edward Dowd says that that 84% increase in millennials dying Uh, because, uh, since the COVID vaccine is non-COVID deaths, by the way.
[02:41:43.992 --> 02:41:47.035]  So that's dying of heart attacks and strokes and blood clots.
[02:41:47.516 --> 02:41:49.778]  Remember Herb Kirk Street, blood clot.
[02:41:50.439 --> 02:41:52.260]  ESPN, not coming to the draft.
[02:41:52.481 --> 02:41:53.522]  Can't fly in an airplane.
[02:41:53.802 --> 02:41:55.023]  It's happening all over America.
[02:41:55.303 --> 02:41:56.825]  People are dropping dead left and right.
[02:41:57.205 --> 02:41:58.046]  Cops are dying.
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:41:59.640]  Left and right.
[02:41:59.660 --> 02:42:00.261]  30-year-old cops.
[02:42:00.281 --> 02:42:03.062]  30-year-old firemen are dropping dead of heart attacks.
[02:42:04.122 --> 02:42:04.583]  Athletes.
[02:42:05.103 --> 02:42:05.643]  Here's the number.
[02:42:05.663 --> 02:42:06.563]  FIFA deaths.
[02:42:07.104 --> 02:42:08.804]  FIFA is the soccer league of Europe.
[02:42:09.405 --> 02:42:14.087]  FIFA deaths have increased 300% since the COVID-19 vaccines were introduced.
[02:42:14.587 --> 02:42:21.050]  These guys are clutching their heart in the middle of a soccer game and dropping dead on the field in front of the fans.
[02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:26.392]  And people in the stands watching the fans are dropping dead, clutching their hearts.
[02:42:26.692 --> 02:42:28.153]  No one's ever seen anything like this.
[02:42:29.844 --> 02:42:32.165]  And life insurance companies report deaths are up.
[02:42:32.525 --> 02:42:36.166]  Non-COVID deaths are up 40% all across the United States.
[02:42:36.206 --> 02:42:37.986]  No one's ever seen anything like this.
[02:42:38.627 --> 02:42:51.731]  But the millennial deaths, as pointed out by hedge fund billion dollar manager Edward Dowd, are about 80,000 young people have died extra in the last year since the vaccines were introduced.
[02:42:52.111 --> 02:42:52.451]  Extra.
[02:42:52.731 --> 02:42:54.211]  She says that's a Vietnam.
[02:42:54.652 --> 02:42:59.373]  That's more than the entire 10 year Vietnam War that have died in one year.
[02:43:00.583 --> 02:43:02.224]  Because of the COVID vaccines.
[02:43:02.664 --> 02:43:03.925]  They didn't die of COVID.
[02:43:04.365 --> 02:43:08.888]  They died of the COVID vaccine side effects.
[02:43:08.908 --> 02:43:08.888]  80,000.
[02:43:09.588 --> 02:43:13.231]  More than the Vietnam War over 10 years in one year.
[02:43:13.991 --> 02:43:18.834]  So how many are going to die this year, and the year after, and the year after, in the next three years?
[02:43:19.314 --> 02:43:20.375]  It's going to accelerate.
[02:43:20.959 --> 02:43:27.924]  The longer those spike proteins are in your body, the more the clot shot clogs your blood with clots.
[02:43:28.564 --> 02:43:37.711]  And the more cancer, the more heart disease, the more heart inflammation, the more cardiac attacks, the more strokes, the more blood clots, and the more death.
[02:43:38.511 --> 02:43:40.113]  So probably it goes from 80,000 to 100, 120, 150,000 extra a year.
[02:43:40.173 --> 02:43:43.135]  And three years from now, you're going to see 500,000 young people extra dead.
[02:43:42.954 --> 02:43:49.434]   a year and three years now you're going to see 500,000 young people extra dead.
[02:43:49.434 --> 02:43:50.434]  Anyone want to investigate?
[02:43:50.434 --> 02:43:51.674]  Wait, I'll root.
[02:43:51.747 --> 02:43:52.367]  We'll be right back.
[02:43:53.288 --> 02:43:54.648]  Wait, I'll root on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:54.668 --> 02:43:55.188]  Welcome back.
[02:43:56.229 --> 02:44:03.951]  I guest host on Tuesdays between noon and 1, West Coast time, where I am here in Las Vegas, the scene of the NFL Draft this week.
[02:44:04.131 --> 02:44:06.592]  And of course, East Coast time, that is 3 p.m.
[02:44:06.612 --> 02:44:07.332]  to 4 p.m.
[02:44:07.812 --> 02:44:08.753]  on Tuesdays.
[02:44:08.813 --> 02:44:11.874]  My website, RootForAmerica.com, because that's what I do all day.
[02:44:11.894 --> 02:44:13.335]   I root For America.
[02:44:13.355 --> 02:44:14.136]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:44:14.336 --> 02:44:14.876]  R-O-O-T.
[02:44:14.916 --> 02:44:16.778]  I root for America dot com.
[02:44:17.219 --> 02:44:19.021]  And of course, you can email me anytime.
[02:44:19.061 --> 02:44:20.242]  Wayne Root at gmail dot com.
[02:44:20.562 --> 02:44:24.126]  And so many of you take me up on it, even in between the breaks.
[02:44:24.186 --> 02:44:28.871]  I look at my trusty iPhone and I see all of the wonderful emails you send me.
[02:44:29.692 --> 02:44:30.633]  One is from Carl.
[02:44:31.253 --> 02:44:34.797]  Carl is a guy who saw me on this show two weeks ago.
[02:44:35.456 --> 02:44:37.379]  And he said, I love you on Alex Jones.
[02:44:37.419 --> 02:44:37.899]  You're great.
[02:44:38.420 --> 02:44:42.806]  And I write, I'm a songwriter who writes number one hits in England.
[02:44:42.846 --> 02:44:44.388]  I've written like 10 number one hits.
[02:44:44.929 --> 02:44:50.817]  And I want to write you a song for the intro of your podcast because you have no music on your podcast.
[02:44:50.837 --> 02:44:51.398]  And that's true.
[02:44:52.463 --> 02:44:59.707]  On my national radio show, I have some of the biggest hit songs because we paid for the rights to them, but you can't use them on podcasts or you get sued.
[02:45:00.228 --> 02:45:01.628]  So the podcast has no music.
[02:45:02.129 --> 02:45:04.070]  So he wrote an original song for me.
[02:45:04.110 --> 02:45:09.273]  We worked on it for two weeks because he'd send it to me and I'd say, I want higher energy on this part.
[02:45:09.573 --> 02:45:10.714]  I want this part to do this.
[02:45:10.794 --> 02:45:11.814]  I want that part to do that.
[02:45:12.095 --> 02:45:13.936]  I want you to come in and suck it right away.
[02:45:14.316 --> 02:45:15.417]  Well, he listened, Carl.
[02:45:15.437 --> 02:45:15.937]  He's good.
[02:45:16.257 --> 02:45:17.598]  No wonder he writes number one songs.
[02:45:18.078 --> 02:45:26.529]  And after a week of collaboration back and forth, he sent me the final version and I love it and it's now the opening song and closing song of my podcast.
[02:45:26.789 --> 02:45:31.154]  So I got him off watching the Alex Jones Show in addition of hundreds of other letters.
[02:45:31.194 --> 02:45:33.857]  Here's another one today from Dominic.
[02:45:33.877 --> 02:45:37.161]  Dominic says, hello sir, just wanted to thank you for all you do.
[02:45:37.842 --> 02:45:44.505]  I'm an ex-liberal and was a lifelong Democrat until they went completely insane with everything they represent now.
[02:45:44.985 --> 02:45:50.727]  Love your story how you came up from nothing and how your father worked hard to get you your opportunities.
[02:45:50.747 --> 02:45:53.729]  Do you have any tips on how to become like you?
[02:45:53.749 --> 02:45:54.589]  Thank you, Dominic.
[02:45:55.289 --> 02:45:58.772]  My tip is I wrote the book The Power of Relentless.
[02:45:59.273 --> 02:46:00.554]  You gotta be relentless.
[02:46:00.594 --> 02:46:02.335]  It's the number one attribute in life.
[02:46:02.755 --> 02:46:04.977]  My Ivy League degree is worthless.
[02:46:05.358 --> 02:46:07.239]  I never got anything from my Ivy League degree.
[02:46:07.619 --> 02:46:07.960]  Nothing.
[02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:11.543]  They taught me zero at Columbia that mattered in the real world.
[02:46:11.923 --> 02:46:12.403]  Zero.
[02:46:12.703 --> 02:46:13.084]  Nothing.
[02:46:13.424 --> 02:46:13.764]  Nada.
[02:46:14.025 --> 02:46:14.285]  Nilch.
[02:46:15.186 --> 02:46:20.729]  So forget the Ivy League degree, although it's nice to go to college and continue four more years of learning.
[02:46:21.330 --> 02:46:24.772]  But I certainly don't recommend it as the reason for success.
[02:46:25.352 --> 02:46:29.154]  My success is due to being a relentless maniac.
[02:46:29.614 --> 02:46:38.079]  And I just call and call and email and email and text and text and bother and hound my targets till I get what I want.
[02:46:38.420 --> 02:46:39.240]  Bullseye!
[02:46:39.740 --> 02:46:42.442]  Read my book, The Power of Relentless, and you'll see the whole game plan.
[02:46:43.456 --> 02:46:43.836]  Here it is.
[02:46:43.917 --> 02:46:49.702]  Thank you, Pitar, my trusty, lifelong producer-director who's with me at all times when I'm on TV.
[02:46:50.102 --> 02:46:51.764]  The Power of Relentless.
[02:46:52.364 --> 02:46:56.868]  That's me in front of my mansion in Las Vegas and my Maserati convertible.
[02:46:57.769 --> 02:47:00.252]  And I'm standing there taking the cover shot for the book.
[02:47:00.532 --> 02:47:04.435]  They always want some sort of a shot that shows you've had some success and you've made some money.
[02:47:04.896 --> 02:47:06.878]  So, The Power of Relentless.
[02:47:07.498 --> 02:47:08.580]  And who endorsed this book?
[02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:09.582]  Donald J. Trump.
[02:47:09.862 --> 02:47:15.030]  That's one of the reasons I first met him was I sent him a copy of this book and he gave me a beautiful endorsement of the book.
[02:47:15.711 --> 02:47:20.258]  And this book lays out everything I've ever done in my life to be successful.
[02:47:20.318 --> 02:47:37.335]   And the follow-up to this book Is Trump rules, which you can see in back of me a few of my Trump rules books, because I got all my philosophy and strategy for success from modeling Donald Trump when I was 18 years old in college and an SOB, son of a butcher.
[02:47:37.735 --> 02:47:43.237]  My dad was a great man, a lot of common sense, but he certainly was not someone that had ever made any money.
[02:47:43.637 --> 02:47:46.378]  So I decided my mentor was Donald J. Trump.
[02:47:46.758 --> 02:47:49.001]  He was the biggest hit in New York, 35 years old.
[02:47:49.341 --> 02:47:50.182]  I was 20, he was 35.
[02:47:51.143 --> 02:47:54.086]  While I was at Columbia University, we had that 15 year age gap.
[02:47:54.406 --> 02:47:55.988]  He's a little bit older and wiser than me.
[02:47:56.449 --> 02:47:58.751]  And I just followed everything Donald Trump ever did.
[02:47:59.232 --> 02:48:03.736]   And it led to all my success and he is a relentless Thumper like me, right?
[02:48:04.076 --> 02:48:08.759]  He just finds something he wants and he hits it, baby, and he knocks it unconscious till he gets what he wants.
[02:48:09.119 --> 02:48:09.479]  You know what?
[02:48:09.559 --> 02:48:10.840]  I like to call us the metaphors.
[02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:11.640]  We're cavemen.
[02:48:12.021 --> 02:48:12.781]  We're cavemen.
[02:48:13.161 --> 02:48:17.964]  We knock it unconscious with a club and then we drag it to the cave if we want it.
[02:48:18.384 --> 02:48:20.145]  We're hunters and sharks.
[02:48:20.706 --> 02:48:22.687]  We're gunslingers, right?
[02:48:23.047 --> 02:48:25.669]  That's what successful people must be.
[02:48:25.749 --> 02:48:29.657]   So there's the answer for For Dominic.
[02:48:29.697 --> 02:48:31.358]  Thank you, Dominic, for writing in.
[02:48:31.899 --> 02:48:44.966]  So I left off with this story that FIFA, I think it's FIFA or FIFA, deaths, that's the soccer leagues of Europe, have increased 300 percent since the COVID vaccines were introduced.
[02:48:45.506 --> 02:48:48.188]  How is anybody not seeing this stuff?
[02:48:49.048 --> 02:48:50.549]  The athletes are dying.
[02:48:51.109 --> 02:48:52.230]  Cops are dying.
[02:48:52.650 --> 02:48:54.291]  Healthy firemen are dying.
[02:48:54.911 --> 02:48:57.573]  Healthy military members are dying and sick.
[02:48:59.071 --> 02:49:01.293]  And millennials, young people are dying.
[02:49:02.474 --> 02:49:03.935]  Is nobody noticing this?
[02:49:04.416 --> 02:49:17.867]  You know, can you imagine if I told you in 1976 we had a swine flu vaccine and we inoculated 60 million Americans and something like 30 of them died?
[02:49:18.368 --> 02:49:19.629]  And you know what the response was?
[02:49:20.501 --> 02:49:31.330]  The medical world, the experts, cancelled the swine flu vaccine program because 30 dead people is not acceptable, even out of 60 million.
[02:49:31.870 --> 02:49:33.432]  But today, what is?
[02:49:34.241 --> 02:49:43.286]  Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, VAERS, tell us there are 27,000 dead Americans directly from the vaccine.
[02:49:43.626 --> 02:49:45.267]  Not 20, not 30, 27,000.
[02:49:46.908 --> 02:49:50.190]  And what does my alma mater, Columbia, say about this?
[02:49:50.650 --> 02:50:02.817]  They've studied the VAERS report, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, for 30 years, which is the gold standard proving whether you've got a problem or not with a vaccine due to deaths and injuries.
[02:50:03.297 --> 02:50:05.641]  And they studied it and said you gotta multiply by 20.
[02:50:06.824 --> 02:50:09.568]  Whatever the deaths are, they're very underreported.
[02:50:09.588 --> 02:50:10.430]  You gotta multiply by 20.
[02:50:10.490 --> 02:50:11.612]  So multiply 27,000 by 20.
[02:50:15.169 --> 02:50:17.590]  Actually, I'm going to do that right now, right on air.
[02:50:17.970 --> 02:50:19.271]  I think it comes out to over 500,000, maybe 520,000.
[02:50:19.110 --> 02:50:21.870]  500,000, maybe 520.
[02:50:21.870 --> 02:50:30.510]   So 27,000, it's getting close to 28,000 by the way, times 20, 540,000 people in America are probably dead
[02:50:30.510 --> 02:50:31.990]  'cause they took the vaccine.
[02:50:31.990 --> 02:50:37.030]   According to not Wayne Root, according to Columbia University researchers,
[02:50:37.030 --> 02:50:43.910]   medical experts, scientists, researchers, say multiply times 20 to get the true number
[02:50:43.910 --> 02:50:46.329]  of people who have died from the vaccine.
[02:50:46.886 --> 02:50:47.467]  And guess what?
[02:50:47.487 --> 02:50:49.108]  You know how many injuries there are from the vaccine?
[02:50:50.130 --> 02:50:51.671]  1.2 million on the VAERS list.
[02:50:52.052 --> 02:51:01.041]  Multiply that times 20, and there's 20 plus million injured Americans from the vaccine, many of them badly injured for the rest of their life.
[02:51:01.421 --> 02:51:04.745]  And a lot of them, based on what we've just seen, are going to die soon.
[02:51:05.326 --> 02:51:07.388]  And you go, well, how come I don't know about any of this?
[02:51:08.098 --> 02:51:11.560]  It's a total blackout in the mainstream media.
[02:51:12.120 --> 02:51:14.882]  Total blackout, whitewash, cover-up.
[02:51:15.442 --> 02:51:17.543]  It's as bad as Hunter Biden's laptop.
[02:51:17.864 --> 02:51:18.544]  It's incredible.
[02:51:19.985 --> 02:51:20.565]  It's incredible.
[02:51:20.925 --> 02:51:26.168]  And there's a second part to the scam separate from the blackout and the whitewash and the cover-up.
[02:51:26.689 --> 02:51:28.890]  And that is the way the statistics are twisted.
[02:51:29.750 --> 02:51:38.072]  Because they set it up so after you get your first vaccine, COVID vaccine, and by the way, I've never been anti-vaccine in my entire life, ever.
[02:51:39.373 --> 02:51:40.973]  I've taken whatever vaccines are necessary.
[02:51:41.033 --> 02:51:42.594]  My kids got whatever vaccines are necessary.
[02:51:42.614 --> 02:51:44.014]  I'm not anti-vax.
[02:51:44.354 --> 02:51:47.315]  I'm anti this vax, which isn't a vaccine.
[02:51:47.715 --> 02:51:53.077]  It's a jab and it's gene therapy that changes the DNA in your body.
[02:51:53.717 --> 02:51:54.537]  It's not a vaccine.
[02:51:54.557 --> 02:51:55.577]  It's never been a vaccine.
[02:51:55.878 --> 02:51:57.158]  You know what the definition of vaccine is?
[02:51:57.805 --> 02:52:17.729]  You get a vial filled with liquid this big and there's a little tiny COVID germ in it and they put it in your body and your body feels the COVID germ and responds to it and therefore teaches the DNA in your body that anytime a real COVID germ comes in after being exposed to this little amount, you know how to fight it.
[02:52:18.009 --> 02:52:20.489]  It ignites your immune system to fight the germ.
[02:52:20.909 --> 02:52:24.270]  That's what they did with polio and smallpox and every other vaccine.
[02:52:24.990 --> 02:52:25.750]  But guess what?
[02:52:26.494 --> 02:52:37.924]  This vaccine, which isn't a vaccine, it's a jab, but it's gene therapy, injects spike proteins by the millions into your body and they don't stay in your shoulder when the vaccine's given.
[02:52:38.325 --> 02:52:48.634]  They go straight to your organs and they kill your organs, which is why little children, there's an outbreak in America of liver disease and hepatitis among little children.
[02:52:48.914 --> 02:52:50.776]  I guarantee you every one of them was vaccinated.
[02:52:51.096 --> 02:52:56.322]  I guarantee you, every one of those kids who has hepatitis or liver failure was vaccinated.
[02:52:56.482 --> 02:52:59.685]  Little kids, meaning teenagers, I'm trying to say, and maybe 10-year-olds.
[02:53:00.386 --> 02:53:06.632]  Hopefully, thank God, hopefully, I pray, nobody's dumb enough to give their 5-year-olds this vaccine.
[02:53:06.692 --> 02:53:09.415]  But it's a problem.
[02:53:10.196 --> 02:53:14.220]  And so, it's not just that there's a cover-up, it's that they set a definition.
[02:53:15.061 --> 02:53:20.085]  Once you get the vaccine, for a month after your first vaccine, you count as unvaccinated.
[02:53:20.545 --> 02:53:23.307]  For two weeks after the second vaccine, you count as unvaccinated.
[02:53:23.607 --> 02:53:27.149]  And I believe after the booster for two weeks, you count as unvaccinated.
[02:53:27.510 --> 02:53:35.075]  So as all the people die after getting vaccinated, they count them as unvaccinated, even though they're vaccinated!
[02:53:35.726 --> 02:53:42.549]  That's the scam in America today, why they're not telling you how many people are dying from the vaccine.
[02:53:42.869 --> 02:53:45.271]  The VAERS list only says 27,000.
[02:53:45.671 --> 02:53:48.392]  According to Columbia, it's about 540,000.
[02:53:49.252 --> 02:53:53.274]  All the rest of them died within the first two weeks after being vaccinated.
[02:53:53.575 --> 02:53:55.335]  So they were counted as unvaccinated.
[02:53:55.976 --> 02:53:56.356]  Wow.
[02:53:56.896 --> 02:53:57.496]  What a scam.
[02:53:57.777 --> 02:53:58.417]  I'm way down the route.
[02:53:59.017 --> 02:54:06.643]  I'm great to be with you today and great to be with you every Tuesday at 12 noon West Coast time, three o'clock East Coast time.

[02:54:25.798 --> 02:54:26.418]  Always fight!
[02:54:26.537 --> 02:54:27.577]  Be relentless!
