[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000]  InfoWars.
[00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:17.516]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:33.295]   today. The letter from Albert Pike regarding the Illuminati plan for three world wars is largely
[00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:40.656]   considered a hoax due to the use of the word Nazism in a letter dated 1871.
[00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:45.141]  But it is interesting to note the desired outcome of this alleged plan.
[00:00:45.821 --> 00:00:57.686]  According to the letter, the Third War officially started on 9-11 and was intended to leave the people in a state of complete physical, moral, spiritual, and economic exhaustion.
[00:00:58.346 --> 00:01:05.869]  They will then use nihilists, atheists, and revolutionaries to create a cataclysm of social turmoil.
[00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:13.392]  And they will do this in order to force the people into exterminating the destroyers of civilization.
[00:01:14.632 --> 00:01:26.218]  According to this letter, this bloodbath would result in the destruction of both Christianity and Atheism, and lead to the pure doctrine of Lucifer as the new world religion.
[00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:39.185]  And it does appear as if this is happening now, as if the powers that be are pushing the people into a desperate corner, as if their main goal is to create mass chaos and violence.
[00:01:41.442 --> 00:01:46.365]  But they've been doing this all by decree because they have no authority over God or the U.S.
[00:01:46.425 --> 00:01:47.205]  Constitution.
[00:01:47.745 --> 00:01:54.689]  And so they'd be thrilled if we burn it all down for them, proving we are inferior savages in need of governance.
[00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:03.014]  They thought they'd have that on January 6th, but the people were there for peace, love, and justice, not a revolution.
[00:02:03.634 --> 00:02:04.575]  We don't need one.
[00:02:05.035 --> 00:02:07.797]  We already have our Declaration of Independence.
[00:02:08.817 --> 00:02:15.384]  But without justice, the death cult remains free and continues on its path to kill us all.
[00:02:16.526 --> 00:02:21.711]  They are going to shut us down again, but this time the United Nations will be in charge.
[00:02:22.765 --> 00:02:29.669]  Our government is giving them that authority at the end of this month, just in time for the next international health crisis.
[00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:39.333]  And with the leaked Supreme Court memo on Roe v. Wade, they can launch endless organized riots on us while we remain locked in our homes.
[00:02:40.414 --> 00:02:45.997]  Round two is coming, and this time with food shortages and the crashing dollar.
[00:02:47.657 --> 00:02:49.237]  But it doesn't have to be like this.
[00:02:49.897 --> 00:02:52.418]  Their authority is the biggest psy-op ever.
[00:02:53.038 --> 00:02:55.639]  You are not their slave unless you choose to be.
[00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.119]  They are convincing you to do this to yourself.
[00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:09.182]  When they demanded that everyone wear a mask in 2020, the majority of us could have said no, demanded justice, and the true renaissance would have then begun.
[00:03:10.302 --> 00:03:15.603]  The 2020 lockdown was a beta test to gauge how compliant the population was.
[00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:17.239]  And we failed.
[00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.440]  But we will soon have another chance.
[00:03:19.881 --> 00:03:30.926]  And 2020 was also a wake-up call for millions of Americans, and millions worldwide, who previously had no idea how corrupt our governments had become.
[00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:33.247]  So now we are many.
[00:03:34.247 --> 00:03:37.149]  And we must all prepare for the next lockdown.
[00:03:39.557 --> 00:03:44.263]  And we must remember that we are not savages, sheep, or slaves.
[00:03:44.904 --> 00:03:47.206]  We are human beings with free will.
[00:03:48.188 --> 00:03:57.038]  And as lawful Americans, it is our responsibility to apprehend these traitors, exact justice, and restore the Republic.
[00:03:58.208 --> 00:04:01.150]  But first, we must simply say no.
[00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.331]  Say no to the masks.
[00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:05.592]  Say no to sheltering in place.
[00:04:06.293 --> 00:04:08.254]  Say no to vaccine passports.
[00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:11.376]  Say no to shutting down your business or your church.
[00:04:12.016 --> 00:04:15.899]  And if the police come to shut you down, make them commit treason.
[00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.901]  The law of the land is already in the hands of the people.
[00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:23.683]  All we have to do is wake up and take it back together.
[00:04:24.824 --> 00:04:27.366]  Peace, love, and justice is ours.
[00:04:28.385 --> 00:04:29.086]  If we want it.
[00:04:30.608 --> 00:04:33.051]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:36.996 --> 00:04:39.179]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.887]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[00:04:48.317 --> 00:04:59.848]  The world is awakening to the fact that there are powerful, ruthless, authoritarian corporations that have been sabotaging human civilization for a long time.
[00:05:04.338 --> 00:05:11.623]  And the only way we can lose this war against these tyrants is if we're not aware of what they're doing.
[00:05:12.123 --> 00:05:15.045]  The old saying rings true because it is true.
[00:05:15.626 --> 00:05:18.668]  The devil's greatest trick was convincing the world he didn't exist.
[00:05:19.328 --> 00:05:21.870]  Sunday emergency broadcast live.
[00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:29.555]  Soros-backed deep state terror squads launch firebombings and intimidation campaigns nationwide.
[00:05:31.104 --> 00:05:33.526]  Fire bombings in Wisconsin.
[00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.029]  Fire bombings in Oregon.
[00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.491]  Fire bombings in other areas.
[00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:39.832]  People's homes being attacked.
[00:05:40.233 --> 00:05:42.595]  Supreme Court justices being driven out of their homes.
[00:05:42.915 --> 00:05:44.777]  People howling and screaming for their heads.
[00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:52.084]  And what does CNN, crawling out from under its rock, have to say?
[00:05:52.564 --> 00:06:06.266]   Law enforcement, the Capitol Police, Say that right-wingers are planning to attack the Capitol, and planning to attack D.C., and planning to attack Supreme Court Justices Holmes.
[00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:10.588]  A total inversion of reality.
[00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:11.369]  Here it is.
[00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:23.571]  ...preparing for potential violence in the Capitol and nationwide after the leak of that Supreme Court draft opinion that would strike down Roe v. Wade after 50 years.
[00:06:23.771 --> 00:06:30.934]  Capitol police are warning the far right is calling for violence against a religious group planning to rally for abortion rights.
[00:06:30.974 --> 00:06:33.136]  Whitney Wilde is live outside the Supreme Court.
[00:06:34.366 --> 00:06:38.091]  Listen, seeing fences go up there, it's sort of like post-January 6th.
[00:06:38.291 --> 00:06:42.897]  What are you seeing and what specific intelligence is warring police officials?
[00:06:44.952 --> 00:07:01.286]  Well, at this point, law enforcement sources, several of them, tell us that they are closely monitoring social media chatter that suggests that there's a potential for violence against abortion clinic providers, abortion clinic staff, members of the judiciary, that would include the justices here, as well as members of the federal government.
[00:07:01.347 --> 00:07:08.233]  And what we know, after January 6th, and what law enforcement knows across the country, is that social media chatter can manifest.
[00:07:08.333 --> 00:07:10.675]  Okay, so, I'm not going to play the rest of it.
[00:07:10.695 --> 00:07:11.816]  You know what they're saying and doing.
[00:07:14.008 --> 00:07:16.850]  The left is running around attacking people all over the country.
[00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:30.500]  We went out, Owen Schroeder went downtown for a pro-abortion rally, and literally, it was like central casting for a zombie apocalypse movie.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.302]  The people yelling and screaming, we want to kill children, we love Satan.
[00:07:34.803 --> 00:07:37.505]  We've got all the footage, Owen's hosting the third and fourth hours tonight.
[00:07:37.885 --> 00:07:39.606]  I'll be here for two hours, he's going to be playing it all.
[00:07:39.846 --> 00:07:44.795]   I'll play some of it, but you don't need me to To show you how they're acting all over the country?
[00:07:44.815 --> 00:07:46.535]  I mean, I have hours of the footage.
[00:07:47.076 --> 00:07:49.777]  I watched hours of it the last two days.
[00:07:50.577 --> 00:07:55.279]  And it is people doing mock abortions and saying, I'm going to kill the babies.
[00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:57.340]  People saying, I love Satan.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.740]  And understand something.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.741]  We're not cherry picking this.
[00:08:02.621 --> 00:08:05.923]  The corporate controlled media and the big tech censor it.
[00:08:06.463 --> 00:08:08.063]  They don't show you who their supporters are.
[00:08:08.104 --> 00:08:08.884]  Demonic zombies.
[00:08:10.404 --> 00:08:15.582]   But anybody can go To one of their rallies.
[00:08:16.823 --> 00:08:18.363]  We'll play clip nine here in a moment.
[00:08:19.343 --> 00:08:22.244]  Anybody can go witness this for themselves and go see it.
[00:08:22.644 --> 00:08:30.126]  And it's not like there's five people out of a thousand that act like demonic pig-like zombies and say they're communists and say they're going to get everybody.
[00:08:31.586 --> 00:08:33.346]  It is the majority of them.
[00:08:35.747 --> 00:08:38.827]  It's like a science fiction horror movie or something.
[00:08:38.867 --> 00:08:41.088]  We've got that huge news.
[00:08:43.097 --> 00:08:44.037]  We're gonna be getting to.
[00:08:45.578 --> 00:08:52.219]  And then we've got unbelievable government reports from around the world confirming the so-called COVID vaccine doesn't work and causes heart attacks and strokes.
[00:08:52.579 --> 00:08:53.440]  I know you know that.
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:54.660]  We've been saying it for over two years.
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.880]  Top scientists have.
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.861]  But now it's confirmed.
[00:08:58.421 --> 00:08:59.061]  And so much more.
[00:08:59.081 --> 00:09:00.481]  They're getting the next lockdown ready.
[00:09:00.501 --> 00:09:06.283]  They're getting the next COVID freakout ready in the next few months with 184 days out from the election.
[00:09:06.303 --> 00:09:07.543]  We've got that information.
[00:09:08.863 --> 00:09:16.588]   We've got huge World War III Nuclear war news and Jill Biden visiting Ukraine.
[00:09:17.929 --> 00:09:20.831]  We have got really critical economic news.
[00:09:21.592 --> 00:09:24.474]  And then, you know, I'm a good talk show host.
[00:09:24.534 --> 00:09:25.354]  I'm a good TV host.
[00:09:25.394 --> 00:09:28.937]  I mean, it's an interesting, informative show, and we try to empower humanity.
[00:09:28.957 --> 00:09:37.023]  But I've got a big point that I really am not good at, and that is hyping something up and building it up.
[00:09:39.525 --> 00:09:43.887]  And so I'm just going to leave it at this, dealing with the disinformation board and George Soros.
[00:09:45.408 --> 00:09:52.172]  We got information two weeks ago that I mentioned on air and then days later was even in the Associated Press, but like it was a good thing.
[00:09:52.912 --> 00:09:55.353]  And then we got more information Friday.
[00:09:56.654 --> 00:09:59.836]  And now we've gotten part of the documents and we're getting more.
[00:10:00.396 --> 00:10:07.880]  But you talk about racketeering, you talk about illegal, what they're trying to do with InfoWars.
[00:10:09.201 --> 00:10:14.305]  And what has come out in the state courts and the bankruptcy court is unbelievable.
[00:10:15.686 --> 00:10:24.472]  You think it's bad that George Soros has kicked out more than 20 state attorney generals and put communists in that let armed robbers out the first day they're arrested?
[00:10:24.492 --> 00:10:33.098]  I mean, hell, one of his DAs up in Fort Worth, a young man for no reason shot four people, critically wounded three of them.
[00:10:33.458 --> 00:10:35.980]  He was let out within 14 hours, not even a day in jail.
[00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:44.287]  Soros runs over a thousand DAs and district attorneys, county attorneys now.
[00:10:46.349 --> 00:10:53.036]  George Soros is not even hiding the fact that he runs the Disinformation Bureau.
[00:10:54.161 --> 00:11:06.024]  And that they have a plan to basically sue tens of thousands of conservative and Christian leaders once the precedent's set with rigged juries, with rigged courts, with default operations against Infowars.
[00:11:06.484 --> 00:11:17.847]  And they admit that and have now admitted to court officials in federal court that George Soros is running this.
[00:11:19.011 --> 00:11:23.253]  And it's set to publicly announce he's trying to take me off the air, which we already knew.
[00:11:23.894 --> 00:11:30.458]  But that arrogance is just unbelievable and makes me proud of who I am.
[00:11:30.898 --> 00:11:33.799]  It makes me really, really proud of all of you.
[00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:37.241]  So I'm going to wait till the lawyers are ready to green light it.
[00:11:38.442 --> 00:11:41.044]  But I already told you part one of it a couple weeks ago.
[00:11:43.005 --> 00:11:44.626]  And the lawyer said, don't get into much detail.
[00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:46.106]  Just if you want to mention it, mention it.
[00:11:46.146 --> 00:11:48.448]  But I said the Justice Department called up.
[00:11:49.468 --> 00:12:06.461]  The federal court and the trustees in our limited bankruptcy and said the head of the Justice Department and the president as policy says you must kick out his bankruptcy and this is basically an order, it is the policy of the U.S.
[00:12:06.541 --> 00:12:08.763]  government, like I was a foreign country.
[00:12:08.783 --> 00:12:12.586]  Because the executive can only do that with foreign countries, they can't do it with a citizen.
[00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:20.649]   But it's Soros that overthrew Ukraine and 20 plus other governments, they are publicly And so I said that on air.
[00:12:21.329 --> 00:12:22.550]  We have the documents and everything now.
[00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:28.531]  I'm going to do a whole report on it soon and build it up because it's huge national news, international news.
[00:12:28.971 --> 00:12:36.213]  And then this new thing, I have the name of the law firms, the documents, Soros, the money, everything.
[00:12:38.453 --> 00:12:42.654]  And we're just going to really put together powerful articles and reports and put it out very, very soon.
[00:12:44.025 --> 00:12:49.649]  But if you want to see what I was talking about earlier, just type in, Justice Department opposes Alex Jones's bankruptcy.
[00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:55.152]  You ever heard of a Justice Department getting involved in my access to the federal courts?
[00:12:57.474 --> 00:13:03.238]  Because I can't fight all these show trials and all these lawsuits anymore, so I say, okay, we'll do an emergency reorganization.
[00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:10.703]  That shows you how scared they are.
[00:13:11.344 --> 00:13:12.024]  Just type that in.
[00:13:12.064 --> 00:13:14.906]  Justice Department opposes Alex Jones' Infowars bankruptcy.
[00:13:16.007 --> 00:13:20.890]  That shows you... Yeah, there it is.
[00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:23.172]  DOJ challenges Alex Jones' bankruptcy.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.282]  I mean, that's the Huffington Post, Associated Press, you name it.
[00:13:30.082 --> 00:13:32.003]  No one's ever done this before, because here's the thing.
[00:13:32.523 --> 00:13:53.155]  The Justice Department's run by the globalists now at the top, the FBI is, the major federal agencies, they've gotten away with bloody murder, they're completely out of control, and no governors, no legislatures, Congress hasn't really opposed them, so why shouldn't they set up an official Ministry of Truth with the Justice Department and Homeland Security and say, we're going to arrest you for your speech?
[00:13:54.528 --> 00:13:56.169]  Finally, Congress says they're going to move.
[00:13:56.469 --> 00:14:03.511]  Finally, a bunch of legislatures and governors are saying they're going to move with lawsuits and blocking this.
[00:14:03.531 --> 00:14:06.473]  But you understand, this is a takeover, people.
[00:14:07.653 --> 00:14:08.573]  This ain't a joke.
[00:14:09.554 --> 00:14:16.096]  We are 184 days out from the midterm elections, and they don't intend for America to peacefully take its nation back.
[00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:24.430]   They are intending To stage false flags and blame it on us and put in the internet kill switch and declare civil emergency martial law.
[00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:25.591]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:25.631 --> 00:14:26.071]  Stay with us.
[00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:32.950]  Let us info-wars.com, the tip of the spear of human liberty.
[00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:40.950]  [Music]
[00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:48.950]   Newtonian physics teaches us that for every action, there is an equal.
[00:14:49.673 --> 00:14:50.073]  All right.
[00:14:49.952 --> 00:14:58.151]   reaction. There is not just evil in the universe, there is good. And I am
[00:14:58.151 --> 00:15:01.752]   extremely blessed and honored to be with this amazing crew and all the viewers
[00:15:01.752 --> 00:15:08.033]   and listeners tonight on Mother's Day in defense of the human family and our
[00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:14.072]   attempt to carry out God's will. All right, you know I almost don't want to
[00:15:14.072 --> 00:15:19.072]   play any of this because I have hours of it. And so to just play a little is
[00:15:19.072 --> 00:15:22.072]  almost like a lie.
[00:15:21.774 --> 00:15:30.283]  I mean, you've got to go out to one of these pro-abortion rallies for yourself.
[00:15:31.805 --> 00:15:38.060]   I first, 25 years ago, I have a friend named George Woolley who's a big pro-life Catholic activist.
[00:15:38.681 --> 00:15:41.083]  And he said, why don't you just not criticize abortion on air?
[00:15:41.504 --> 00:15:43.085]  Why don't you come out and see it for yourself?
[00:15:43.105 --> 00:15:45.708]  So I went out to Planned Parenthood probably 15 times or so.
[00:15:46.128 --> 00:15:47.229]  Done it more than that since then.
[00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:52.354]  And people would walk up and say, Satan will get the children!
[00:15:53.375 --> 00:15:53.796]  Off camera.
[00:15:54.096 --> 00:15:54.877]  And sometimes on camera.
[00:15:56.161 --> 00:16:00.542]  And I would have black people walk up to me, particularly, that worked there or worked around there.
[00:16:00.582 --> 00:16:02.803]  They'd say, nobody wants these black babies.
[00:16:03.123 --> 00:16:04.284]  You gonna take some?
[00:16:04.704 --> 00:16:06.884]  We don't get rid of these bad people.
[00:16:07.205 --> 00:16:08.785]  Talk about Uncle Tom's to the death.
[00:16:08.825 --> 00:16:09.345]  They were it.
[00:16:10.486 --> 00:16:12.566]  And then over the years, we caught it ourselves on tape.
[00:16:12.586 --> 00:16:18.628]  When I say hundreds, thousands of times, hell, Owen caught it hundreds of times, the three-hour report he put out just yesterday.
[00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:20.629]  We got a bunch of those clips.
[00:16:22.861 --> 00:16:27.962]  Here's a clip as the Democrats called for a tax on Catholic and Protestant churches.
[00:16:29.743 --> 00:16:33.444]  And this is a standard deal to have a fake baby you rip out of yourself with fake blood.
[00:16:33.784 --> 00:16:37.745]  Sometimes they put the red syrup everywhere and say, I'm gonna kill it!
[00:16:37.805 --> 00:16:39.125]  I'm gonna kill the baby!
[00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:40.326]  You're not gonna stop me!
[00:16:40.826 --> 00:16:42.686]  So they don't even deny they're killing babies.
[00:16:42.706 --> 00:16:45.207]  They don't even deny, like Biden said last week, yeah, we're killing children.
[00:16:46.447 --> 00:16:49.048]  Main abortion groups, Gloria Steinem wore a shirt saying, yeah, I killed my child.
[00:16:51.032 --> 00:16:58.099]  They have hardened their hearts and they are turned over to a demonic force to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:16:58.939 --> 00:17:02.122]  So, I've got dozens of these, but let's just get started on some of them.
[00:17:02.963 --> 00:17:13.673]  Here is a woman trying to get into a Catholic church with hundreds on the street of leftist crazed maniacs, and she is celebrating killing babies in front of them.
[00:17:13.713 --> 00:17:14.074]  Here it is.
[00:17:15.625 --> 00:17:35.625]  [crowd shouting]
[00:17:35.625 --> 00:17:40.625]   And again for radio listeners, there's so much cussing and screaming you can't really even hear it.
[00:17:40.625 --> 00:17:45.625]  There's a woman in a bathing suit ripping babies to pieces.
[00:17:45.625 --> 00:17:49.625]  [woman shouting]
[00:17:49.625 --> 00:17:50.625]  You never know.
[00:17:50.625 --> 00:17:54.625]  [crowd shouting]
[00:17:54.855 --> 00:17:55.776]  This is a religion.
[00:17:57.057 --> 00:17:58.799]  Every ancient culture did it when it collapsed.
[00:17:59.579 --> 00:18:01.579]  It's happening again.
[00:18:01.579 --> 00:18:08.579]  And this goes on and on.
[00:18:08.579 --> 00:18:10.579]  -Give me my bag! -Give me my bag!
[00:18:09.747 --> 00:18:10.167]  No more.
[00:18:10.247 --> 00:18:11.007]  Just turn it off.
[00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:14.149]  Then I guess the crowd celebrates her and she starts eating the babies again.
[00:18:15.369 --> 00:18:20.371]  There's all these weird leftist transgender people that do mock abortions and pull the babies out with blood spraying everywhere.
[00:18:22.232 --> 00:18:23.112]  It just goes on and on.
[00:18:23.132 --> 00:18:23.812]  It gets much worse.
[00:18:23.852 --> 00:18:24.613]  I'm not going to show it.
[00:18:26.673 --> 00:18:35.454]   There's a bunch of this footage, but they've run multiple members of the Supreme Court Including the Chief Justice, John Roberts, out of their homes.
[00:18:36.095 --> 00:18:41.078]  And now we learn from other leaked documents that he's been blocking it for a year.
[00:18:41.999 --> 00:18:45.162]  And that already the Supreme Court has the majority to overturn Roe v. Wade.
[00:18:45.662 --> 00:18:52.187]  But as Chief Justice, he's been blocking it and waited, because he's really a liberal, a leftist, because he's blackmailed.
[00:18:53.508 --> 00:18:55.829]  Look at him and his wife and the stuff they're into.
[00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:56.230]  It's bad.
[00:18:57.967 --> 00:19:01.729]  So it would be a political thing for the election to divert from everything.
[00:19:01.749 --> 00:19:02.929]  So it's a good thing that's happening.
[00:19:03.970 --> 00:19:06.151]  Under federal law, it should be the state decision anyways.
[00:19:06.211 --> 00:19:08.652]  Nobody's even banning their sacrament of abortion.
[00:19:09.412 --> 00:19:10.873]  They're putting it back to the people and states.
[00:19:11.373 --> 00:19:13.254]  And it should be under our federal system.
[00:19:15.115 --> 00:19:18.156]  And again, federal system doesn't mean the federal government runs everything.
[00:19:18.236 --> 00:19:18.956]  It's the opposite of that.
[00:19:18.976 --> 00:19:25.499]  It means separation of powers, divided powers, states, local governments, and the federal government, and three branches of the federal government.
[00:19:27.944 --> 00:19:32.929]  They're at their homes screaming, yelling by the thousands, 24 hours a day, and the left is celebrating this.
[00:19:33.529 --> 00:19:35.831]  But if conservatives protest anyway, we're terrorists.
[00:19:35.651 --> 00:19:37.651]  Here it is.
[00:19:37.651 --> 00:19:50.651]  [Chanting]
[00:19:50.651 --> 00:19:54.651]  [Chanting]
[00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:58.651]   They're saying we are people, we have rights, we're saving lives.
[00:19:58.507 --> 00:19:59.668]  Everything is an inversion.
[00:20:01.549 --> 00:20:05.592]  Everything is an inversion of the truth with these demons.
[00:20:07.773 --> 00:20:22.122]  Now, here's a man confronting a bunch of pro-death demonstrators during the whole COVID lockdown, and he got it right that you claim you care about lives, but here's what's really going on in these hospitals.
[00:20:22.463 --> 00:20:22.643]  Flip 21.
[00:20:24.231 --> 00:20:25.751]  Or just some black lives?
[00:20:27.992 --> 00:20:30.433]  The black lives killed by black men matter, right?
[00:20:32.093 --> 00:20:32.393]  Yes?
[00:20:33.673 --> 00:20:36.474]  The black babies killed in the abortion clinics matter, right?
[00:20:37.574 --> 00:20:38.094]  Thought so.
[00:20:38.755 --> 00:20:43.856]  The black officers killed by that bastard in Minnesota, that matters too, right?
[00:20:44.776 --> 00:20:45.156]  Okay.
[00:20:45.456 --> 00:20:48.937]  But the black babies that are killed in the abortion clinics don't matter, do they?
[00:20:49.477 --> 00:20:50.177]  Medical people.
[00:20:51.558 --> 00:20:52.538]  Do their lives matter?
[00:20:53.837 --> 00:20:55.958]  Does the future of our black babies matter?
[00:20:57.058 --> 00:20:57.438]  Huh?
[00:20:57.879 --> 00:20:58.379]  What's up?
[00:20:58.739 --> 00:20:59.119]  What's up?
[00:20:59.219 --> 00:21:00.600]  Awful quiet now, aren't they?
[00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:01.820]  Uh-huh.
[00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:04.721]  It's okay if we kill them in the womb, right?
[00:21:06.462 --> 00:21:10.764]  But you have a problem when we, you don't seem to really have a problem when we kill them on the streets.
[00:21:11.744 --> 00:21:13.765]  Yes, well we know they're the same issue.
[00:21:14.085 --> 00:21:23.229]  If we don't, if we don't respect the lives of our unborn children enough to save them and fight for them, our lives mean nothing once we're born.
[00:21:24.005 --> 00:21:24.445]  That's right.
[00:21:24.545 --> 00:21:25.906]  We become everything that is evil.
[00:21:26.366 --> 00:21:27.926]  And that was back during the whole George Floyd thing.
[00:21:27.946 --> 00:21:34.668]  He goes out to one of those doctor-nurse demonstrations for the lockdowns, Black Lives Matter, and he says, Oh, you care about George Floyd?
[00:21:34.688 --> 00:21:35.069]  Yeah.
[00:21:35.089 --> 00:21:35.549]  You care about this?
[00:21:35.569 --> 00:21:35.729]  Yeah.
[00:21:35.749 --> 00:21:36.489]  You care about the babies?
[00:21:36.569 --> 00:21:37.149]  No!
[00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.690]  And I've got hundreds of clips.
[00:21:40.509 --> 00:21:59.950]   I've already played them this week, but here's another one of the sickening leftists.
[00:22:00.116 --> 00:22:04.838]  Understand, go to one of their events, that's 90% of them.
[00:22:06.298 --> 00:22:07.519]  And they all look like mutants.
[00:22:07.599 --> 00:22:08.739]  Black, Hispanic, white.
[00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:10.639]  They all look like their souls sucked out.
[00:22:10.659 --> 00:22:12.220]  Nobody's having sex with these people.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.621]  And they're just pissed that men and women are having families and having children.
[00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.151]  Suck that little bastard right out!
[00:22:20.031 --> 00:22:21.871]  Oh, she's not saying it's not a human.
[00:22:22.231 --> 00:22:23.491]  She's not saying no.
[00:22:23.951 --> 00:22:27.992]  She gets off on killing that little bastard.
[00:22:29.893 --> 00:22:30.793]  I have hours of this.
[00:22:31.133 --> 00:22:32.853]  Owen shot a bunch of them with the crew.
[00:22:34.113 --> 00:22:35.294]  They attacked Owen physically.
[00:22:35.334 --> 00:22:37.154]  The police offered to arrest the people that did.
[00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:39.314]  Owen said no and turned the other cheek.
[00:22:41.095 --> 00:22:42.115]  He'll be covering all that.
[00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:48.377]  In an hour and two minutes at 6 p.m.
[00:22:48.417 --> 00:22:48.778]  Central.
[00:22:50.267 --> 00:22:51.928]  Or an hour and 32 minutes, excuse me.
[00:22:52.448 --> 00:22:53.309]  An hour and 32 minutes.
[00:22:53.789 --> 00:22:56.510]  He'll be covering it all on Sunday live.
[00:22:57.451 --> 00:22:58.391]  I'm 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:22:58.972 --> 00:23:01.053]  Owen is 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:23:01.453 --> 00:23:04.395]  Then we have the weekday shows kicking off with Harrison Smith at 8 a.m.
[00:23:04.975 --> 00:23:06.636]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:23:06.676 --> 00:23:07.636]  Myself at 11 a.m.
[00:23:08.017 --> 00:23:09.097]  The War Room 3 p.m.
[00:23:09.357 --> 00:23:10.938]  with Owen Schroyer every weekday.
[00:23:11.218 --> 00:23:14.600]  We're only on air because of you and your prayer, your financial support.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.341]  The fight is so critical right now.
[00:23:16.461 --> 00:23:17.461]  Thank you for your support.
[00:23:17.461 --> 00:23:25.661]  Live, raw and uncensored.
[00:23:25.661 --> 00:23:28.240]  (upbeat music)
[00:23:28.729 --> 00:23:32.876]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:23:33.618 --> 00:23:35.100]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:23:38.897 --> 00:23:47.479]  Hi, Robert Barnes is a constitutional lawyer, good friend of mine, always a great interview, but he's been on fire lately, not just on my show, but everywhere.
[00:23:48.159 --> 00:24:05.464]  He's going to cover the midterms, Russia, the economy, the Roe v. Wade fight, the deep state, what he thinks they're going to plan, one of the smartest people I know, you don't want to miss it, second hour today, and you want to tell everybody you know, tune in, because exposing these people is an act of resistance.
[00:24:06.664 --> 00:24:11.606]  And promoting links and articles and videos is the death knell of their tyranny.
[00:24:11.866 --> 00:24:19.688]  Their whole program banks bets on being able to suppress and silence you.
[00:24:19.768 --> 00:24:27.651]  And a very well-known talk show host, the biggest in the world, don't really leave any names unknown there.
[00:24:27.891 --> 00:24:28.972]  He didn't say it was off record.
[00:24:29.472 --> 00:24:32.613]  We talked a lot Friday night.
[00:24:32.653 --> 00:24:33.473]  He was really pissed.
[00:24:34.954 --> 00:24:35.974]  It's such a wake-up call.
[00:24:37.153 --> 00:24:44.561]  He was trying to send me, we're in a group chat, we talk like 20 times a day on there, myself and Eddie Bravo, the great Jiu Jitsu master.
[00:24:46.302 --> 00:24:57.254]  He's trying to send me links to like screenshots of mainstream articles about J&J admitting that the blood clots are being caused by the shot and the FDA.
[00:24:57.834 --> 00:25:00.377]  They wouldn't let him and he said, that's it, I'm getting off Apple.
[00:25:01.769 --> 00:25:04.150]  And I'm like, it's not Apple's bad enough.
[00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:06.752]  It's your phone provider.
[00:25:07.432 --> 00:25:08.072]  It's the carrier.
[00:25:09.353 --> 00:25:16.216]  And yes, Facebook is blocking their WhatsApp for years, what can be sent over it.
[00:25:16.597 --> 00:25:18.838]  And you think you're sending the image, but people aren't getting it.
[00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:25.261]  And so if you think they were just censoring Twitter and Facebook and Google and YouTube and Apple, no.
[00:25:25.661 --> 00:25:28.903]  Now, and this has been known for years, but it's intensifying.
[00:25:30.049 --> 00:25:32.010]  With AI watching what you're doing and saying.
[00:25:32.391 --> 00:25:37.054]  And so there was obviously something encoded on the memes and images he was sending me.
[00:25:37.114 --> 00:25:47.781]  So he screenshotted it, cropped it a little, and then that meme hadn't been uploaded to the AI, and he was able to send it to me.
[00:25:49.022 --> 00:25:50.903]  Now, this individual's been fighting censorship.
[00:25:50.923 --> 00:25:52.484]  This individual's a good friend of mine of many years.
[00:25:53.305 --> 00:25:59.189]  But it was such a wake-up call that it just drove him into overdrive.
[00:26:04.096 --> 00:26:05.357]  And that's what's going to happen to everybody.
[00:26:05.637 --> 00:26:06.938]  You know, there's a limit, folks.
[00:26:07.438 --> 00:26:09.780]  And are you going to take the tyranny until it's too late to beat it?
[00:26:10.721 --> 00:26:13.603]  Churchill once wrote a news article.
[00:26:13.683 --> 00:26:18.506]  It's much more eloquent than I can paraphrase, but he basically said this.
[00:26:18.986 --> 00:26:20.547]  I might get it word for word, but I'm going to try.
[00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:49.263]   He said, there are many times in history when tyranny Approaches and oppression and enslavement is is at hand when there's a very very very very good chance to beat it And the public doesn't stand up and Then there becomes an opportunity to defeat the takeover the enslavement the tyranny when there is a 50-50 chance of winning and
[00:26:51.055 --> 00:26:53.557]  And those civilizations and societies don't stand up and fight.
[00:26:54.277 --> 00:26:59.380]  Because they're living in the past, they're living on the dregs of freedom that were left, they just can't believe what's happening to them.
[00:27:00.341 --> 00:27:06.965]  And he said, then there comes a time, this is when most people fight, in fact they almost always do, when there's no chance of winning.
[00:27:07.686 --> 00:27:11.848]  But it's better to die on your feet than live on your knees as a slave.
[00:27:13.109 --> 00:27:26.023]   And he was quoting Zapata, the famous Mexican revolutionary, and Zapata was quoting a Greek philosopher, but the point is, is that We had a good chance of beating this 28 years ago when I was first on air.
[00:27:29.705 --> 00:27:35.109]  We had a 50-50 chance of stopping it just three years ago.
[00:27:35.129 --> 00:27:38.091]  And now, ladies and gentlemen...
[00:27:42.099 --> 00:27:42.899]  It's already happening.
[00:27:43.099 --> 00:27:47.661]  The world breakdown, the societal collapse, the food collapse, the open Satanism and pedophilia everywhere.
[00:27:48.501 --> 00:27:48.982]  It's here.
[00:27:49.022 --> 00:27:49.822]  We're going to go through it.
[00:27:49.842 --> 00:27:52.183]  The question is, how bad is it going to be?
[00:27:52.703 --> 00:27:59.466]  When are you, and I'm not bitching at the regular audience, I'm telling the new viewers to dial in and realize this isn't a game.
[00:28:02.867 --> 00:28:03.747]  This isn't a joke.
[00:28:06.128 --> 00:28:08.429]  This is 100% real as a heart attack.
[00:28:09.749 --> 00:28:14.705]   So you either get in the game, Or you roll over in the ditch and get on your knees.
[00:28:17.407 --> 00:28:18.287]  And then there is no hope.
[00:28:19.628 --> 00:28:21.610]  You were made to be informed.
[00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:23.331]  You were built to be involved.
[00:28:23.451 --> 00:28:33.539]  You were envisioned by God as a powerful entity that's frightfully made.
[00:28:33.619 --> 00:28:34.120]  That's a quote.
[00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:36.261]  Fearfully made.
[00:28:37.202 --> 00:28:45.398]   Because when God makes you and gives you free will and you're powerful and made in the image of God, And God turns you loose, that's fearful.
[00:28:46.318 --> 00:28:49.179]  The angels looking on at you know you're more powerful than they are.
[00:28:50.319 --> 00:28:51.659]  They just already know the full game.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:56.821]  You're being tested, and they're fearful when you're made.
[00:28:56.861 --> 00:28:59.621]  When that soul gets created, they're in awe.
[00:29:00.982 --> 00:29:11.141]   But when you're not in awe of yourself, and you don't realize you're made of the divine, When you don't realize you've got that eternal connection, you turn into these people.
[00:29:11.962 --> 00:29:14.342]  I showed you last segment.
[00:29:19.204 --> 00:29:21.725]  I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.
[00:29:21.845 --> 00:29:26.306]  Marvelous are thy works, and that my soul knoweth right well.
[00:29:27.287 --> 00:29:28.667]  King James Version, Psalms 139.14.
[00:29:29.007 --> 00:29:33.229]  That's just one of the places.
[00:29:36.365 --> 00:29:39.827]  And so, you don't want to be turned into these creatures.
[00:29:42.608 --> 00:29:46.530]  You don't want to deny the connection of the infinite.
[00:29:48.691 --> 00:29:58.895]  Because when you deny God's Spirit, and God's open hand, you then accept by choice all that rejected God.
[00:29:59.295 --> 00:30:04.486]   And that's not A spiritual group you want to be associated with.
[00:30:04.886 --> 00:30:06.988]  You do not want to be with that.
[00:30:07.148 --> 00:30:08.789]  You want to say no.
[00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:11.711]  And you want to take God in.
[00:30:14.573 --> 00:30:16.414]  Now does that mean every church?
[00:30:18.226 --> 00:30:18.747]  It's perfect.
[00:30:18.767 --> 00:30:20.188]  Does that mean every Christian's good?
[00:30:20.248 --> 00:30:20.488]  No.
[00:30:20.888 --> 00:30:27.454]  But it means you better reach out to God or you will be turned into one of these creatures.
[00:30:27.855 --> 00:30:29.797]  And you see what happens to them without God.
[00:30:30.117 --> 00:30:30.898]  They are lost.
[00:30:31.218 --> 00:30:32.179]  They are delusional.
[00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:33.580]  They are destroyed.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:36.463]  They are gibbering demons.
[00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:43.968]  You want to be that crazy black woman screaming saying I love killing babies and gnawing on them and sound like an idiot?
[00:30:44.289 --> 00:30:46.412]  Or that powerful black man's voice?
[00:30:46.672 --> 00:30:48.495]  Get that clip we played earlier, cue back up.
[00:30:50.858 --> 00:30:51.199]  Saying...
[00:30:52.639 --> 00:30:53.759]  You're killing the babies.
[00:30:53.819 --> 00:30:55.160]  You don't care about black lives.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:59.360]  I mean, listen to the power in his voice and how well he's spoken and how strong it is.
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.361]  It's all true and it's perfectly said versus her.
[00:31:04.221 --> 00:31:05.982]  She's run by the devil.
[00:31:06.502 --> 00:31:07.742]  He's run by God.
[00:31:08.322 --> 00:31:10.963]  Anybody could say, who do I want to be in business with?
[00:31:11.043 --> 00:31:11.323]  Him.
[00:31:12.243 --> 00:31:13.043]  Who do I trust?
[00:31:13.103 --> 00:31:13.323]  Him.
[00:31:13.343 --> 00:31:15.464]  It's not about skin color, it's about the spirit.
[00:31:15.724 --> 00:31:16.764]  Do you want to be around her?
[00:31:16.964 --> 00:31:17.804]  The answer's no.
[00:31:19.164 --> 00:31:19.744]  Here he is again.
[00:31:19.764 --> 00:31:22.365]  Just some black lives.
[00:31:24.679 --> 00:31:27.121]  The black lives killed by black men matter, right?
[00:31:28.782 --> 00:31:29.062]  Yes?
[00:31:30.343 --> 00:31:33.145]  The black babies killed in the abortion clinics matter, right?
[00:31:34.265 --> 00:31:34.766]  Thought so.
[00:31:35.426 --> 00:31:40.530]  The black officers killed by that bastard in Minnesota, that matters too, right?
[00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.831]  Okay.
[00:31:42.131 --> 00:31:45.613]  But the black babies that are killed in the abortion clinics don't matter, do they?
[00:31:46.153 --> 00:31:46.854]  Medical people.
[00:31:48.235 --> 00:31:49.276]  Do their lives matter?
[00:31:50.516 --> 00:31:52.578]  Does the future of our black babies matter?
[00:31:53.726 --> 00:31:54.106]  Huh?
[00:31:54.546 --> 00:31:55.067]  What's up?
[00:31:55.407 --> 00:31:55.807]  What's up?
[00:31:55.867 --> 00:31:57.267]  Awful quiet now, aren't they?
[00:31:58.068 --> 00:31:58.488]  Uh-huh.
[00:31:59.228 --> 00:32:01.389]  It's okay if we kill them in the womb, right?
[00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:07.431]  But you have a problem when we- you don't seem to really have a problem when we kill them on the streets.
[00:32:08.412 --> 00:32:10.432]  Yes, we know they're the same issue.
[00:32:10.752 --> 00:32:19.896]  If we don't- if we don't respect the lives of our unborn children enough to save them and fight for them, our lives mean nothing once we're born.
[00:32:23.072 --> 00:32:25.858]  All right, I want to hit the Government Disinformation Board.
[00:32:25.878 --> 00:32:33.401]   I'm going to hit it more with Bob Barnes next hour, but I want to hit it some because Mike Myers has got a new movie out.
[00:32:33.581 --> 00:32:34.862]  It's also on Netflix.
[00:32:35.343 --> 00:32:36.444]  I got a bunch of calls about it.
[00:32:36.464 --> 00:32:39.526]  It's called The Pentaverant, making fun of the Illuminati.
[00:32:39.546 --> 00:32:41.408]  It attacks me quite a bit in the movie.
[00:32:41.908 --> 00:32:45.411]  And I thought we would just show how desperate these folks are and look into that.
[00:32:45.491 --> 00:32:47.573]  Then the war in Russia and how dangerous it is.
[00:32:48.033 --> 00:32:49.254]  The economy and more.
[00:32:49.755 --> 00:32:53.118]  But make no mistake, you're inside the satanic takeover now, folks.
[00:32:53.498 --> 00:32:57.842]  And the only hope we've got, and it is more than hope, it is victory, is Jesus Christ.
[00:32:58.502 --> 00:32:59.723]  Infowars.com.
[00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:01.304]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:33:01.463 --> 00:33:02.463]  We'll be back.
[00:33:02.463 --> 00:33:05.463]  [music]
[00:33:05.463 --> 00:33:10.463]  [music]
[00:33:10.463 --> 00:33:15.463]  The answer to 1984 is 1760.
[00:33:14.873 --> 00:33:21.873]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:21.873 --> 00:33:34.153]   If you watch what the corporate establishment puts out, their disinformation boards, their
[00:33:34.153 --> 00:33:38.793]   stuff right out of fictional dictatorships in 1984, something only a few countries like
[00:33:38.793 --> 00:33:42.432]   North Korea actually have, communist China, Stalinist Russia, and you think, "This is
[00:33:42.432 --> 00:33:44.273]  cartoonish.
[00:33:44.273 --> 00:33:45.711]  This is like textbook tyranny.
[00:33:45.653 --> 00:33:47.234]  Well, that's because that's what this is.
[00:33:48.294 --> 00:33:54.316]  They have taken us being asleep and us putting up with all this garbage as a green light, a big giant green light.
[00:33:54.776 --> 00:33:55.496]  Come after everybody.
[00:33:56.658 --> 00:34:03.641]  And finally, Congress and the courts and the legislatures are waking up and the establishment is doubling and tripling down.
[00:34:05.222 --> 00:34:07.082]  I watched a bunch of this Friday after it happened.
[00:34:07.123 --> 00:34:08.443]  I probably watched 20 minutes of it.
[00:34:08.483 --> 00:34:09.003]  It's gold.
[00:34:09.043 --> 00:34:10.224]  It's up on Bandai Video.
[00:34:10.644 --> 00:34:18.204]   Senator Paul destroys the head of the DHS and lays out how ridiculous it is to have
[00:34:18.204 --> 00:34:28.084]   the government "involved in disinformation" when it's the biggest purveyor of it.
[00:34:28.084 --> 00:34:32.124]   And again, while they're getting that clip ready, Senator Rand Paul and the Disinformation
[00:34:32.124 --> 00:34:36.764]  Board, I will go over some of the articles for you on that.
[00:34:36.782 --> 00:34:37.803]  You guys know the clip I'm talking about?
[00:34:39.566 --> 00:34:40.427]  Oh, okay, we have it now?
[00:34:40.528 --> 00:34:41.148]  Oh, fantastic.
[00:34:41.188 --> 00:34:41.869]  Go ahead and play it now.
[00:34:42.858 --> 00:34:44.159]  Do we have policies?
[00:34:44.519 --> 00:34:45.900]  Do we have guardrails?
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:49.242]  Do we have scanners to explore?
[00:34:49.302 --> 00:34:51.663]  We can't even agree what disinformation is.
[00:34:52.084 --> 00:34:56.906]  You can't even agree that it was disinformation that the Russians fed information to the Steele dossier.
[00:34:56.926 --> 00:35:02.330]  If you can't agree to that, how are we ever going to come to an agreement on what is disinformation so you can police it on social media?
[00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:07.413]  I think you've got no idea what disinformation is and I don't think the government's capable of it.
[00:35:07.613 --> 00:35:10.955]  Do you know who the greatest propagator of disinformation in the history of the world is?
[00:35:11.475 --> 00:35:11.835]  The U.S.
[00:35:11.875 --> 00:35:12.316]  government.
[00:35:12.916 --> 00:35:14.297]  Are you familiar with McNamara?
[00:35:14.837 --> 00:35:15.658]  The Pentagon Papers?
[00:35:16.766 --> 00:35:20.087]  Are you familiar with George W. Bush and the weapons of mass destruction?
[00:35:20.107 --> 00:35:22.647]  Are you familiar with Iran-Contra?
[00:35:23.327 --> 00:35:28.589]  I mean, think of all the debates and disputes we've had over the last 50 years in our country.
[00:35:29.129 --> 00:35:31.109]  We work them out by debating them.
[00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:33.370]  We don't work them out by the government being the arbiter.
[00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:34.910]  I don't want you to guard rails.
[00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.870]  I want you to have nothing to do with speech.
[00:35:37.271 --> 00:35:38.691]  You think we can't determine?
[00:35:39.591 --> 00:35:42.213]  You know, speech by traffickers is disinformation?
[00:35:42.493 --> 00:35:45.856]  You think the American people are so stupid they need you to tell them what the truth is?
[00:35:46.176 --> 00:35:48.778]  You can't even admit what the truth is with the Steele dossier.
[00:35:49.078 --> 00:35:51.360]  I don't trust government to figure out what the truth is.
[00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:55.082]  Government is largely disseminating disinformation.
[00:35:57.204 --> 00:36:00.826]  Then we've got the new head of the Ministry of Truth.
[00:36:01.832 --> 00:36:13.483]  Nina Jakowicz, who also has headed up things for George Soros, saying it's liberals and minorities that are being silenced on social media, which all the studies show is the complete opposite.
[00:36:13.503 --> 00:36:13.844]  Here it is.
[00:36:14.735 --> 00:36:30.252]  There's already this idea, this allegation, that there is anti-conservative bias on the platforms, even though there has been study after study proving, in fact, that often it's liberal voices that are being silenced, particularly minority voices on social media.
[00:36:30.332 --> 00:36:32.575]  So I think we're going to see more allegations of that.
[00:36:33.849 --> 00:36:35.609]  So that's something else they're doing.
[00:36:35.629 --> 00:36:40.670]  They're saying there's no censorship, even though they're on record saying they're going to censor and want more censorship.
[00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:44.851]  But when you say you don't want it, oh it doesn't exist except it's happening to the minorities.
[00:36:45.511 --> 00:36:51.193]  And then they make how government corporations are censoring us about minorities as if they have something to do with it.
[00:36:51.733 --> 00:36:57.814]  They just bring them in like, oh let big corporations and government censor you or you're against the black people that we all want to abort.
[00:36:59.602 --> 00:37:04.523]  Here's President Trump speaking about how this is the number one issue at a rally Friday night.
[00:37:07.084 --> 00:37:19.987]  In addition, we will get critical race theory out of our schools, out of our military, and out of every part of our federal, state, and local governments.
[00:37:20.007 --> 00:37:28.997]   You know, I had done that, and then just about in his first day in office, he Wrote an executive office ending it, but we had already done that.
[00:37:29.037 --> 00:37:29.657]  It was gone.
[00:37:29.857 --> 00:37:30.738]  Got rid of all of them.
[00:37:31.559 --> 00:37:37.744]  One of our highest priorities will be to crack down on left-wing censorship and restore free speech in America.
[00:37:37.764 --> 00:37:39.225]  We don't have free speech.
[00:37:40.025 --> 00:37:42.888]  We don't have free speech and we have a totally crooked press.
[00:37:43.028 --> 00:37:43.969]  All of them back there.
[00:37:44.709 --> 00:37:49.553]  We will immediately terminate Joe Biden's so-called disinformation governing board.
[00:37:49.593 --> 00:37:50.394]  How about that one?
[00:37:51.798 --> 00:37:57.322]  A chilling and un-American power grab that we will not allow to stand.
[00:37:58.723 --> 00:38:01.605]  Go out and sign up now for, by the way, Truths.
[00:38:01.965 --> 00:38:02.306]  Truths.
[00:38:03.026 --> 00:38:06.249]  I'm so happy to be back on social media.
[00:38:09.111 --> 00:38:13.794]  So, Trump sat there, and I'm not critical of Trump overall.
[00:38:14.034 --> 00:38:16.276]  He sat there while this was all happening under his nose.
[00:38:17.830 --> 00:38:20.232]  And the statement that he stopped it when he was in is not true.
[00:38:20.272 --> 00:38:22.314]  He let him run roughshod where they even banned him.
[00:38:23.975 --> 00:38:26.117]  But, thank God, he's finally doing something.
[00:38:26.937 --> 00:38:29.820]  But he can't even say truth to social right, and he's made one post on there.
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:35.124]  And he says he won't go back on Twitter, but he should use Twitter to promote the alternative.
[00:38:35.144 --> 00:38:37.966]  But, look, look, that's just my advice to Trump.
[00:38:39.668 --> 00:38:44.612]  Let's shift gears to the other area of disinformation that's taking place.
[00:38:46.468 --> 00:38:50.631]  And that is corporate media in Hollywood.
[00:38:50.952 --> 00:38:55.135]  If you think there's propaganda on CNN or ABC News or MSNBC, you're right.
[00:38:55.856 --> 00:39:06.364]  But where it really is, is embedded as propaganda placement is what I call it, like product placement, but live placement, in movies and TV shows and Netflix programs.
[00:39:07.525 --> 00:39:18.217]   And Mike Myers, who I liked in Wayne's World, did a great job as Dr. Evil, who claims he's apolitical, I've had a chance now to watch part of it.
[00:39:18.237 --> 00:39:19.317]  I don't have time to watch all of it.
[00:39:19.778 --> 00:39:34.647]  But throughout the movie, the pentavirate, which was an old joke he had 20 years ago about, you know, this kid's got a Scottish grandfather that believes that there's these secret groups running things.
[00:39:34.687 --> 00:39:40.411]  So they always ridiculed that because they knew secret groups were running things, and they didn't want a debate or a discussion.
[00:39:42.081 --> 00:39:45.519]   About how secret groups because if you start having a discussion
[00:39:45.519 --> 00:39:51.871]   About how the United Nations is running the world or how the private IMF or World Bank as a consortium with the
[00:39:51.871 --> 00:39:54.820]   World Economic Forum if you start doing that
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:40:04.091]   It is then gonna empower you to know that You're being circumvented and instead of just fighting with
[00:40:04.091 --> 00:40:10.181]   somebody because of what color they are Instead of just fighting with somebody over some
[00:40:10.181 --> 00:40:14.861]   distraction or divide-and-conquer issue You'll actually understand who the globalist are and what
[00:40:14.861 --> 00:40:20.251]   their policies are and what they're trying to do And then you'll be an active player in the fight in the
[00:40:20.251 --> 00:40:24.800]   debate in the discussion And you'll be on par with them intellectually
[00:40:25.327 --> 00:40:32.952]  But if you don't admit there's a world government, a cashless society, and a COVID tyranny, and all this coming into place, well then you don't have any hope.
[00:40:33.032 --> 00:40:38.395]  It's like being blind in a volleyball, or football, or ping pong match, or a boxing match.
[00:40:38.715 --> 00:40:40.276]  You're going to get your ass handed to you.
[00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:45.319]  So here's a clip from his new program, The Pentavirate, attacking yours truly.
[00:40:49.346 --> 00:40:50.947]  Welcome to Truth Battle.
[00:40:51.648 --> 00:40:53.589]  I'm Rhett Smith, here to shievel.
[00:40:53.729 --> 00:40:55.310]  Ah, he's an internet conspiracy guy.
[00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.371]  He is nuttier than a squirrel turd.
[00:40:57.191 --> 00:40:58.191]  [laughter]
[00:40:58.191 --> 00:41:01.751]   Let me tell you the truth you won't get from the fake news Hollywood elites with the black
[00:41:01.751 --> 00:41:06.630]   helicopter chemtrails from deep state FEMA camps that hide Hillary's emails about Ben
[00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.630]  Gavsey.
[00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:10.630]  And the ancient tongue of the snake people, the Illuminati.
[00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:15.390]   They take supple Christian men off the street and force them into the Canaanite ritual gay
[00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.791]  sex in coffins.
[00:41:16.851 --> 00:41:17.391]  Hey, I heard that.
[00:41:17.411 --> 00:41:18.472]  Rex Smith speaks the truth, my friend.
[00:41:18.492 --> 00:41:21.393]  He talks about the stuff that you and the lamestream media want to try and cover up.
[00:41:21.233 --> 00:41:25.233]  as a sacrifice to the online meme momo.
[00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:28.233]  I'm Rex Smith, stay awake and...
[00:41:28.233 --> 00:41:30.233]  STAY PISSED!
[00:41:30.233 --> 00:41:32.233]  What a load of balloon juice.
[00:41:32.233 --> 00:41:34.233]  Hey, I heard that.
[00:41:34.233 --> 00:41:36.233]  Rex Smith speaks the truth, my friend.
[00:41:36.233 --> 00:41:42.233]   He talks about the stuff that you and the lame stream media want to try and cover up.
[00:41:42.233 --> 00:41:45.233]  Hi, I'm Anthony.
[00:41:45.233 --> 00:41:47.233]  You have to know what conspiracy theorists...
[00:41:47.233 --> 00:41:53.233]  [Music]
[00:41:53.763 --> 00:41:55.344]  Welcome to Truth Battle.
[00:41:55.564 --> 00:41:56.784]  I'm Rex Smith here.
[00:41:57.044 --> 00:41:57.924]  Shabo here.
[00:41:57.964 --> 00:42:00.745]  My studio is in Roanoke, Virginia.
[00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:11.068]  We're discussing the pent-up end-secret meeting of world leaders known as the Meadows, which takes place in three days in Surmat, Switzerland, near the Matterhorn.
[00:42:12.679 --> 00:42:16.300]  But first, let me tell you about Bracksmith Male Enhancement Cola.
[00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:22.541]  My cola will not only enhance your performance, but will increase your size!
[00:42:22.701 --> 00:42:25.062]  Bracksmith Male Enhancement Cola.
[00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.162]  You'll be happy.
[00:42:26.502 --> 00:42:29.443]  And she'll be happy too, because you'll get a boner!
[00:42:30.883 --> 00:42:31.743]  Until tomorrow.
[00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:33.224]  Stay awake!
[00:42:33.644 --> 00:42:34.644]  Stay vigilant!
[00:42:38.645 --> 00:42:39.265]  Fuck you!
[00:42:40.805 --> 00:42:42.926]  So there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:42.946 --> 00:42:45.067]  That's the type of garbage that they're putting out.
[00:42:45.088 --> 00:42:55.774]  And they're just so desperate to psychologically inoculate and prepare everyone, in case they come across what I'm doing or saying, to not look in to what we're covering.
[00:42:55.874 --> 00:43:09.982]  Because if you look at the Davos Group saying they're going to de-industrialize, they're going to take your rights, they're going to make you poor, they're going to forcibly inject you, they're going to track and trace everywhere you go and control with programmable digital money what you can spend the money on.
[00:43:12.346 --> 00:43:13.386]  Well then it's game over for them.
[00:43:14.267 --> 00:43:16.288]  They don't have a hope in 80s.
[00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:18.669]  If you're informed.
[00:43:18.689 --> 00:43:19.729]  In hour number two today.
[00:43:23.491 --> 00:43:24.972]  In hour number two, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:27.152 --> 00:43:40.118]  We are gonna hit the Russia situation, the economy, the disinformation boards, what's happening with Roe v. Wade, the leftist terror mobs attacking and firebombing facilities and going after the Supreme Court justices and more.
[00:43:40.158 --> 00:43:41.219]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:43:41.059 --> 00:43:43.059]  Please stay with us.
[00:43:43.059 --> 00:43:56.554]   Big Brother Mainstream media.
[00:43:57.115 --> 00:43:58.256]  Government cover-ups.
[00:43:58.997 --> 00:44:00.478]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:44:00.719 --> 00:44:01.840]  Well, so does he.
[00:44:02.401 --> 00:44:07.086]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:44:10.269 --> 00:44:16.515]  If you had asked me all this stuff a year ago about the corruption that's going on, I would have said you're crazy.
[00:44:16.575 --> 00:44:20.639]  There's no way that there could be this level of corruption in government.
[00:44:20.699 --> 00:44:29.006]  You shouldn't listen to InfoWars and Band.Video because that's all nonsense and, you know, you shouldn't pay attention to any of this stuff.
[00:44:32.249 --> 00:44:42.238]  It's been very evident to me that all these people who are being labeled as misinformation spreaders, I mean, they're the guys telling the truth.
[00:44:42.698 --> 00:44:50.485]  There are many thousands of physicians who have been silenced from telling the American people the good news about the situation, that we can manage the virus.
[00:44:50.965 --> 00:44:54.626]  The true misinformation spreaders are the CDC and the public health officials.
[00:44:54.846 --> 00:44:58.087]  This remains a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[00:44:58.267 --> 00:45:00.908]  They are the ones that are propagating this outbreak.
[00:45:00.928 --> 00:45:03.088]  The only people you can blame, this isn't shaming, this is the truth.
[00:45:03.489 --> 00:45:04.569]  Maybe they should be shamed.
[00:45:04.989 --> 00:45:05.949]  Of the unvaccinated.
[00:45:06.469 --> 00:45:10.871]  This is a situation of an outbreak and a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[00:45:10.811 --> 00:45:17.811]   Dr. Fauci's probably done more good for the world than all of us in this room combined.
[00:45:17.811 --> 00:45:25.451]   Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement
[00:45:25.451 --> 00:45:30.131]   of May 11th where you claimed that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in
[00:45:30.681 --> 00:45:32.301]  I totally resent that.
[00:45:32.401 --> 00:45:36.002]  And if anybody is lying here, Senator, it is you!
[00:45:36.202 --> 00:45:48.985]  We now know that Fauci-funded EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit headed by Peter Daszak, was absolutely engaged in gain-of-function research to make chimeric, SARS-based coronaviruses, which they confirmed could infect human cells.
[00:45:49.105 --> 00:45:49.825]  And the worst part?
[00:45:50.325 --> 00:45:54.750]  All the people going along and being lab rats for these heartless megacorporations.
[00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:56.532]  It is truly incredible.
[00:45:56.852 --> 00:46:02.278]  If only people had the entire story that the COVID shots are not conventional vaccines.
[00:46:02.678 --> 00:46:08.484]  There are plenty of examples of people that are having very serious medical conditions that result from the vaccination.
[00:46:08.644 --> 00:46:12.869]  When the convulsion started, I knew it had to be from the vaccine.
[00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:18.132]  Due to this vaccine, I don't even know if I'll gain full movement in my leg back.
[00:46:18.412 --> 00:46:20.814]  One of their high school football players died.
[00:46:20.834 --> 00:46:24.716]  He had two blood clots inside his brain, another on the outside of his brain.
[00:46:24.836 --> 00:46:27.217]  The hardest thing was I let him get that shot.
[00:46:29.639 --> 00:46:32.280]  They got the vaccine!
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:34.120]  [Crying]
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.120]  [Crying]
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:38.120]  [Crying]
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:40.120]  We need help.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:48.120]  [Music]
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.120]  When you have U.S.
[00:46:50.645 --> 00:47:00.333]  Senators in both parties saying we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before, what do you think that makes the Russians do?
[00:47:00.594 --> 00:47:02.015]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[00:47:04.995 --> 00:47:06.476]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[00:47:06.496 --> 00:47:09.917]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[00:47:10.317 --> 00:47:14.559]  Only one level above that on their DEFCON, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[00:47:15.559 --> 00:47:22.242]  And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use nuclear weapons on Russia.
[00:47:22.642 --> 00:47:23.923]  Think of their ignorance.
[00:47:24.643 --> 00:47:33.886]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[00:47:34.467 --> 00:47:37.067]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5.
[00:47:38.348 --> 00:47:44.010]  Land-launched systems they can also launch from ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:46.191]  And yes, the United States has those too.
[00:47:47.546 --> 00:47:50.727]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed systems that we don't have.
[00:47:51.127 --> 00:47:52.227]  It's on record that the U.S.
[00:47:52.267 --> 00:47:53.447]  has those systems.
[00:47:53.467 --> 00:47:58.528]  The point is it's called Mutually Assured Destruction or MAD for a reason.
[00:47:59.388 --> 00:48:02.629]  Because anyone that would violate the MAD doctrine is insane.
[00:48:03.649 --> 00:48:05.790]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war.
[00:48:06.570 --> 00:48:08.290]  Especially when Russia's not starting a fight with us.
[00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:14.592]  And especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia when that was all a giant lie.
[00:48:14.792 --> 00:48:16.472]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[00:48:20.347 --> 00:48:29.999]  Ladies and gentlemen, one of the smartest people I know, Robert Barnes, to cover the waterfront, is about to join us in 60 seconds after this break.
[00:48:30.719 --> 00:48:35.065]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now and resist the censors.
[00:48:35.185 --> 00:48:38.385]  The most banned network in the world.
[00:48:38.385 --> 00:48:38.885]  [POP]
[00:48:38.885 --> 00:48:45.885]  [MUSIC]
[00:48:45.885 --> 00:48:53.585]   Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[00:48:53.585 --> 00:48:54.884]  the InfoWar.
[00:48:54.884 --> 00:49:04.185]  [MUSIC]
[00:49:04.295 --> 00:49:08.396]  We are now into hour number two of this Sunday night broadcast.
[00:49:08.496 --> 00:49:10.277]  I'm here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:49:10.317 --> 00:49:10.737]  Central.
[00:49:11.157 --> 00:49:14.498]  Owen Schroyer hosts Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:49:14.518 --> 00:49:20.459]  He's got incredible footage in Austin of the pro-abortion crowd, literally with communist flags.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:26.561]  Most of the leaders, men saying they're women, and the open calling for killing of children.
[00:49:27.241 --> 00:49:29.662]  The celebrating of it, saying, yeah, their children were going to kill them.
[00:49:30.282 --> 00:49:34.246]  That footage is coming up in the third and fourth hour today.
[00:49:35.187 --> 00:49:45.377]  Now, right now with Robert Barnes, good friend of mine, great constitutional lawyer, but one of the smartest historians and political operatives I know, we're going to cover everything.
[00:49:45.898 --> 00:49:56.405]   We're going to cover Roe v. Wade and the fire bombings and the intimidation squads and where that's going in the midterms 184 days out and what are the globals going to do to try to defeat this giant political realignment that's
[00:49:56.405 --> 00:49:57.526]  already taking place.
[00:49:57.526 --> 00:50:03.126]   We have the massive situation unfolding in Russia and the new developments there we're
[00:50:03.126 --> 00:50:04.126]  going to be getting into.
[00:50:04.126 --> 00:50:08.684]   We've got George Soros openly running the new disinformation board that is right out
[00:50:08.684 --> 00:50:11.285]  of 1984.
[00:50:11.285 --> 00:50:15.726]   We have the inflation, we have the situation in China, we have the old, the COVID news
[00:50:15.726 --> 00:50:19.686]   that's breaking where J&J's had to pull their shot admitting it causes blood clots and heart
[00:50:20.438 --> 00:50:26.962]  This is an incredible time in history, Robert Barnes, and I haven't talked to you since earlier today in tech saying, did you come on?
[00:50:27.342 --> 00:50:31.044]  And I just said, just please come on, because you can obviously talk about all these issues.
[00:50:31.164 --> 00:50:32.605]  You're just like I am, and our listeners are.
[00:50:32.645 --> 00:50:33.705]  You've got your head in the game.
[00:50:34.206 --> 00:50:35.526]  What do you want to hit on first?
[00:50:35.606 --> 00:50:36.487]  What is most important?
[00:50:38.005 --> 00:50:41.429]  I think it's a great premiere, the film 22,000 Mules.
[00:50:42.029 --> 00:50:46.073]  I think that details what we talked about all the way back in Atlanta, Georgia in November of 2020.
[00:50:47.376 --> 00:50:52.319]  And laid out how they committed the election fraud, how they stole the 2020 election.
[00:50:52.779 --> 00:50:56.721]  It was America's color revolution and what took place.
[00:50:56.961 --> 00:50:58.282]  And there are a lot of things that led up to it.
[00:50:58.322 --> 00:51:07.587]  The BLM riots, the Antifa activity, the pandemic, the lockdowns, all of those things that were key to laying the stage for what took place in November.
[00:51:08.007 --> 00:51:11.689]  But what took place in November was a three-level unconstitutional election.
[00:51:12.229 --> 00:51:17.371]  The people who voted were not constitutionally qualified to vote, many of them.
[00:51:17.551 --> 00:51:21.612]  The method by which they voted was not a constitutionally qualified method of voting.
[00:51:21.993 --> 00:51:35.457]  And then the count and the canvassing of the ballots was not done in a constitutionally qualified manner, because to be constitutionally qualified in a presidential election required that the state legislature set the rules, and the state legislature's rules were ignored and eviscerated.
[00:51:36.017 --> 00:51:39.979]  And what 2000 Mules does well is document one part of it.
[00:51:40.499 --> 00:51:44.601]  And the one part of it was, how did they flood the system with illegal ballots?
[00:51:45.201 --> 00:51:47.442]  One, they sent out a bunch of ballots unchecked.
[00:51:48.042 --> 00:51:51.263]  Right here in Las Vegas, last week, I received two ballots.
[00:51:51.803 --> 00:51:52.964]  One ballot for me, and one ballot for you.
[00:51:53.004 --> 00:51:54.344]  Mars, let me interrupt you, which I'm famous for.
[00:51:54.384 --> 00:51:55.444]  Let me interrupt you and start over.
[00:51:55.464 --> 00:51:56.825]  Because I didn't know you bring up...
[00:51:57.949 --> 00:52:02.469]   this new film. For those that don't know, tell us where it is, who made it, what it
[00:52:02.469 --> 00:52:05.989]   covers, and the fact that Fox is saying they're not going to air it now, even
[00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:10.029]   though it's totally documented. As you said, the electronic scam was the deep
[00:52:10.029 --> 00:52:13.509]   state red herring, which you were proven right about, when you were all over the
[00:52:13.509 --> 00:52:17.909]   country for Trump proving it was mules voting multiple times, getting,
[00:52:17.909 --> 00:52:21.389]   harvesting the fake ballots, filling them in and entering them, and that's now been
[00:52:21.389 --> 00:52:25.109]   proven. You have been totally vindicated. We're not putting down other people that
[00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:28.349]  wanted to go with the electronic thing and all that BS.
[00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:31.549]   They're not bad people. Let's just admit they got conned and move on to how
[00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:36.230]   they really did it, because they're planning to do it again in 184 days with a
[00:52:36.230 --> 00:52:40.068]   new COVID hysteria we'll get to next segment, but just break down what this
[00:52:40.068 --> 00:52:44.829]   film is and why they're censoring it. So Dinesh D'Souza put together a film and he
[00:52:44.829 --> 00:52:49.339]   relied heavily on the theories that we've been talking about, which was to
[00:52:49.339 --> 00:52:53.689]   focus and highlight the methods and mechanisms by which they got all these
[00:52:53.689 --> 00:53:10.326]   illegal ballots into Either because the person was not constitutionally qualified to vote, in other words, they lived in multiple states, they were dead, they were incompetent, like the nursing home votes in Wisconsin, they were too young to vote, they were not legally here, they were not legally citizens.
[00:53:10.846 --> 00:53:12.448]  But how did they get those votes in?
[00:53:12.488 --> 00:53:14.089]  They got them in through the mail-in system.
[00:53:14.129 --> 00:53:15.210]  But how did that happen?
[00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.812]  Well, they were able to circumvent the U.S.
[00:53:17.852 --> 00:53:36.489]  Postal Service and circumvent the regular method of delivering ballots by instituting drop boxes all across the country, which was funded by Mark Zuckerberg in the tunes of hundreds of millions of dollars, bribing election officials, as the Wisconsin, former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice, Office of Special Counsel for the state legislature has confirmed in his report.
[00:53:36.889 --> 00:53:38.950]  And they are extremely scared of this.
[00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:40.931]  So how do you beat real election fraud evidence?
[00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:46.133]  You bring up fake election fraud evidence, get useful idiots to cover it, and none of us are perfect.
[00:53:46.173 --> 00:53:50.515]  I covered it some, you were warning at the time, but I covered all aspects of it, all points of the competence.
[00:53:51.056 --> 00:53:53.857]  That's how you kill a real story with a fake story.
[00:53:53.877 --> 00:53:56.058]  They are so scared of D'Souza's new film.
[00:53:56.438 --> 00:53:58.959]  Where do people find it?
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:53:59.560]  2,000 Mules.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:02.161]  So they can find it at Dinesh D'Souza's Locals page.
[00:54:02.897 --> 00:54:07.183]  Uh, so they can join his locals page, get a year's subscription, and get the film for free.
[00:54:07.804 --> 00:54:11.890]  And the core of the film is about from the 25-minute mark to about the 45-minute mark.
[00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:12.831]  And it's a slam dunk.
[00:54:12.931 --> 00:54:14.834]  It's a slam dunk proving how they do it.
[00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.611]  Exactly.
[00:54:16.691 --> 00:54:25.579]  And some of it was stuff I was complaining about to RNC Chairwoman of the Romney family back at the time.
[00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:30.544]  And as we said, we need real investigative resources, real legal resources to battle this.
[00:54:30.604 --> 00:54:46.437]   And one way to expose it was to show not only the disparate turnout at places like nursing homes and mail drops and places like that, But one of the mechanisms would be the mules that were videotaped doing this because they were required to have video surveillance on all the drop boxes.
[00:54:46.857 --> 00:54:56.063]  But instead, they refused to expend any, they raised hundreds of millions of dollars in the names of investigating this, and then they pocketed it and grifted it, went to other things.
[00:54:56.524 --> 00:55:04.729]  So, this is, this details what would have happened had we actually done the investigation at the time that some of us were requesting that the RNC refuse to do it.
[00:55:04.749 --> 00:55:09.794]   You and I were in those states, like, That's exactly right.
[00:55:10.496 --> 00:55:16.414]   like Arizona and we were trying to get this done and it wasn't done.
[00:55:16.414 --> 00:55:17.414]  That's exactly right.
[00:55:17.414 --> 00:55:20.335]   In other words, what he's detailed is what we said we would be able to prove.
[00:55:20.335 --> 00:55:24.456]   Which is when you look at the video surveillance of what took place at these drop boxes, what
[00:55:24.456 --> 00:55:28.256]  you see is people dropping off multiple ballots.
[00:55:28.248 --> 00:55:29.889]  Not delivering one ballot, multiple ballots.
[00:55:29.929 --> 00:55:31.850]  Sometimes they're delivering them at 3 in the morning.
[00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:38.472]  What they took, what 2,000 in Mules did, is they just bought the data that's available to geotrack your cell phone.
[00:55:38.552 --> 00:55:50.358]   And they tracked cell phones that were visiting multiple Dropboxes on multiple days and stopping off at the kind of places where they And then they went and got the surveillance footage and show it.
[00:55:51.558 --> 00:55:51.979]  Exactly.
[00:55:52.179 --> 00:55:55.901]  And you could see things like people walking up late at night with gloves.
[00:55:56.301 --> 00:55:56.841]  With gloves.
[00:55:56.901 --> 00:55:57.662]  They would put the ballots in.
[00:55:57.682 --> 00:55:58.082]  Hey, hey, hey.
[00:55:58.182 --> 00:56:12.850]  My brother-in-law, who's a really smart guy, he's a chemist, and my dad, both were at post offices days after the election and saw people with hundreds of ballots signing them and putting them in.
[00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:14.511]  They saw it themselves.
[00:56:14.551 --> 00:56:15.832]  It was going on after the election.
[00:56:17.009 --> 00:56:17.469]  Absolutely.
[00:56:17.489 --> 00:56:22.653]  Pennsylvania took 10 days to process the ballots.
[00:56:23.994 --> 00:56:25.835]  Georgia, more and more ballots kept showing up.
[00:56:26.435 --> 00:56:28.537]  Day after day after day, more ballots kept showing up.
[00:56:29.443 --> 00:56:30.064]  How did that happen?
[00:56:30.104 --> 00:56:30.864]  This is how it happened.
[00:56:31.265 --> 00:56:38.430]  So they needed mules as their intermediaries, and this just captures one aspect of the fraud, because the fraud was broader and more wholesale.
[00:56:38.731 --> 00:56:44.756]  But this is an aspect that here they have smoking gun evidence of mules putting in more ballots.
[00:56:44.796 --> 00:56:50.320]  And remember, in most of these states, this form of ballot trafficking is illegal, is a crime.
[00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:53.563]  That makes those ballots themselves illegal ballots.
[00:56:53.963 --> 00:56:59.510]  Regardless of how those ballots came in, regardless of what the original intention of a voter was, it doesn't matter.
[00:56:59.811 --> 00:57:03.676]  That ballot was done and cast in an illegal, unconstitutional manner.
[00:57:03.956 --> 00:57:05.859]  That makes it a ballot that could not be counted.
[00:57:06.219 --> 00:57:12.067]  And there's just tracking these mules in the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, and Arizona.
[00:57:12.447 --> 00:57:23.816]  They were able to find more illegal ballots than the margin of victory by a large margin, sometimes by a multiple of 10 or more, in every single one of these states, just tracking this one aspect of the fraud.
[00:57:24.116 --> 00:57:36.726]  That was why we always said, you need to do a signature match check, because if you did a signature match check, you'd be able to prove that a lot of these ballots were illegal, and that's why no state to this day has done a signature match check on these ballots.
[00:57:37.266 --> 00:57:46.538]  And now we hear Fox News is going to be blocking out Dinesh D'Souza, who's a totally respected filmmaker, totally incredible record as a journalist, super respected.
[00:57:46.919 --> 00:57:48.581]  They're going to be blocking this.
[00:57:48.921 --> 00:57:50.223]  The press is reporting.
[00:57:51.345 --> 00:57:55.307]  Yes, I mean, in fact, they reported it last night in the after show of the premiere.
[00:57:55.767 --> 00:58:05.572]  They reported that, in fact, they had been told, this involves the True the Vote organization that helped participate in this, they had been told that Fox's lawyers were quashing Fox from putting on any demonstration.
[00:58:05.953 --> 00:58:12.656]  Even Tucker, who interviewed one of the people concerning this, has apparently been told not to cover this precise story in detail.
[00:58:12.996 --> 00:58:14.277]  So we're going to find out what's happening.
[00:58:15.936 --> 00:58:16.596]  Unbelievable.
[00:58:16.676 --> 00:58:18.637]  Folks, you want smoking gun evidence.
[00:58:19.257 --> 00:58:20.397]  2,000 mules in Essa Sousa.
[00:58:20.877 --> 00:58:22.218]  We definitely need to get him back on the show.
[00:58:22.258 --> 00:58:23.118]  He's been on many times.
[00:58:23.798 --> 00:58:24.818]  Unbelievable information.
[00:58:24.878 --> 00:58:25.478]  Robert Barnes.
[00:58:25.498 --> 00:58:27.359]  We're going to cover a bunch of other breaking news.
[00:58:27.879 --> 00:58:30.500]  Always riveting and informative with Robert Barnes.
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:31.740]  Infowars.com.
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:32.720]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:33.360]  Today.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:35.180]  Everybody, you know, tune in now.

[00:58:55.180 --> 00:59:05.180]  [MUSIC]
[00:59:04.955 --> 00:59:09.355]   Rain and wind and weather, Hell and forever,
[00:59:09.355 --> 00:59:14.355]  Wishing my gal was by my side.
[00:59:14.355 --> 00:59:19.355]   All the things I'm missing, Goodbills, love and kissing,
[00:59:19.355 --> 00:59:22.355]  Are waiting at the end of my rope.

[00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:24.401]  Head em' up!
[00:59:24.441 --> 00:59:25.581]  Move em' on!
[00:59:25.602 --> 00:59:26.742]  Move em' on!
[00:59:26.782 --> 00:59:27.523]  Head em' up!
[00:59:27.703 --> 00:59:28.463]  Row high!
[00:59:28.863 --> 00:59:29.404]  Count em' out!
[00:59:29.804 --> 00:59:30.264]  Ride em' in!
[00:59:30.284 --> 00:59:31.485]  Ride em' in!
[00:59:31.525 --> 00:59:32.686]  Count em' out!
[00:59:32.726 --> 00:59:33.286]  Ride em' in!
[00:59:33.366 --> 00:59:34.447]  Row high!
[00:59:35.422 --> 00:59:39.744]  Robert Barnes, what a historic time we are in right now here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:40.325 --> 00:59:53.312]  Obviously, if the deep state globalists pre-programmed it all, Pelosi said it doesn't matter how many votes he gets, there'll be a red wave, it'll look like he wins election night, we have the votes, we have the mail-in ballots, he will be gone.
[00:59:55.206 --> 00:59:59.767]  And then we witnessed this in this 2000 mules in the session, Dinesh D'Souza.
[01:00:00.467 --> 01:00:04.369]  And the proof they've got is just so incredible.
[01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:06.469]  And to see how scared the system is.
[01:00:06.509 --> 01:00:09.350]  Let's speak to that in closing before we get to other issues.
[01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:11.911]  And then ask the big question about the midterms 184 days out.
[01:00:13.351 --> 01:00:16.174]  The pre-programming, CNN, ABC News, NBC.
[01:00:16.715 --> 01:00:20.599]  Oh, the terror, the firebombings, the attacks on the Supreme Court justices.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.061]  It's Republicans.
[01:00:22.542 --> 01:00:23.322]  I played it first hour.
[01:00:23.343 --> 01:00:24.063]  I'm not going to play it again.
[01:00:24.504 --> 01:00:29.149]  But the level of gaslighting and disinfo is turning everyone against them.
[01:00:29.249 --> 01:00:33.514]  What are they going to do faced with total political realignment?
[01:00:33.534 --> 01:00:34.035]  Robert Barnes.
[01:00:35.202 --> 01:00:38.404]  There's going to be a complete suppression and censorship of this story.
[01:00:38.444 --> 01:00:43.506]  There's already so-called fact-checkers out there saying that 2,000 in mules can't prove what it infers.
[01:00:43.847 --> 01:00:45.187]  Well, they have videotaped evidence.
[01:00:45.407 --> 01:00:50.570]  What were people doing delivering tons of ballots, multiple ballots, with their gloves on?
[01:00:50.590 --> 01:00:53.091]  Not only with their gloves on, they have surgical gloves on.
[01:00:53.472 --> 01:00:57.974]  And then after they put the ballots in, they take the surgical gloves off and throw them in the trash can.
[01:00:58.354 --> 01:00:58.615]  Why?
[01:00:58.675 --> 01:01:02.939]  So there'd be no fingerprint track records on those ballots in case anybody was checking them.
[01:01:03.359 --> 01:01:06.182]  In fact, that started to happen after it got publicly reported.
[01:01:06.302 --> 01:01:08.725]  This was coordinated across the country.
[01:01:09.861 --> 01:01:10.502]  Absolutely.
[01:01:10.642 --> 01:01:12.383]  And it was what we said from the get-go.
[01:01:12.443 --> 01:01:22.030]  What they did was they unlocked the safe, they unlocked the door, took down the video cameras, told people the security guards were gone, and said they were going to be gone for a couple of weeks.
[01:01:22.350 --> 01:01:26.713]  And that's why you get different levels of fraud in different places, is they outsource the fraud.
[01:01:26.993 --> 01:01:33.058]  So that any organization, any, a lot of these NGOs were part of it, a lot of the Zuckerberg-related groups were connected to it.
[01:01:33.778 --> 01:01:35.399]  And the key is, how do we reform this?
[01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:36.180]  How do we fix this?
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:38.844]  We need to ban drop boxes everywhere.
[01:01:39.184 --> 01:01:44.252]  We need to limit mail-in voting to the truly indefinitely confined and military.
[01:01:44.692 --> 01:01:52.684]  We need to have meaningful signature match checks imposed with third-party observers, as we require by the way of elections internationally.
[01:01:53.044 --> 01:01:55.586]  We require elections around the world to have these standards.
[01:01:55.847 --> 01:01:58.029]  We can at least have the same standards ourselves.
[01:01:58.389 --> 01:02:03.794]  And that will prevent this particular method of ballot election fraud from happening in the future.
[01:02:04.094 --> 01:02:12.121]  This was massive ballot trafficking caught on tape and documented in the geospatial data that they were able to use tracking cell phones.
[01:02:12.382 --> 01:02:17.206]  What were people doing visiting 28 different drop boxes over a three-day time period?
[01:02:17.226 --> 01:02:18.347]  And that's my next question.
[01:02:18.607 --> 01:02:19.908]  They're not going to give up.
[01:02:19.968 --> 01:02:21.528]  What do you expect them to pull this time?
[01:02:21.908 --> 01:02:30.092]  They're already saying, as you predicted, I predicted a year ago, in the midterms they would launch a new variant, try new restrictions, more mail-in ballots.
[01:02:30.412 --> 01:02:31.513]  And I've got it here in the news.
[01:02:32.133 --> 01:02:35.034]  We've got Democrat governors, Newsom and others, calling for mail-in ballots.
[01:02:35.414 --> 01:02:36.395]  All the rest the same crap.
[01:02:37.605 --> 01:02:39.626]  Well, people got to keep the pressure on.
[01:02:40.007 --> 01:02:58.139]  So keep the pressure on to get legislators and governors in these states to change the election rules and election laws to make sure these mass drop boxes don't happen again, that mass mail-in voting doesn't happen again, that ballots don't get sent out just en masse, millions more than we're going to be able to even vote in the first place.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:04.664]  Make sure that doesn't reoccur, because that's the mechanism they need to be able to achieve this scale of voter fraud.
[01:03:04.984 --> 01:03:08.626]  Without this, their ability to do it is dramatically limited and restricted.
[01:03:08.987 --> 01:03:16.871]  So it's a court of public opinion making sure that our elected officials at the local and state level do not facilitate this continued fraud.
[01:03:17.432 --> 01:03:18.712]  Let's expand on that then.
[01:03:19.493 --> 01:03:21.254]  Obviously they want to escalate to war in Russia.
[01:03:21.394 --> 01:03:24.736]  Obviously they want to talk about cyber attacks that are imminent.
[01:03:25.136 --> 01:03:26.377]  This is like Venezuela.
[01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:29.795]   We're trying to kick Hugo Chávez out.
[01:03:30.236 --> 01:03:31.718]  They're not going to go away quietly.
[01:03:31.778 --> 01:03:35.883]  What else do you think they've got in their quiver or in their hand of cards, Barnes?
[01:03:37.423 --> 01:03:39.906]  Well, they're still trying to escalate the conflict in the war.
[01:03:40.306 --> 01:03:42.008]  And they still, they want to drag us into it.
[01:03:42.048 --> 01:03:46.872]  That's why you see the New York Times running leaks about how we're helping to kill Russian generals.
[01:03:47.213 --> 01:03:50.716]  That's why you're seeing them leak that supposedly we sunk a Russian ship.
[01:03:51.097 --> 01:03:58.024]  They want Russia to, we're trying to provoke the Russian bear, prod the Russian bear into doing something directly in a NATO country.
[01:03:58.044 --> 01:04:01.247]  That's what I'm saying, you're officially at war with us, let's get it on.
[01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:02.770]  Exactly.
[01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:09.076]  And these are people, you're seeing, I don't know if it was the Wall Street Journal the other day, major publications saying maybe we could win a nuclear war.
[01:04:09.096 --> 01:04:11.678]  I mean, we're back to George C. Scott, Dr. Strangelove.
[01:04:12.018 --> 01:04:14.400]  Ah, don't worry, you know, 10,000, 20,000 tops.
[01:04:15.641 --> 01:04:17.022]  10, 20 million tops?
[01:04:18.043 --> 01:04:18.444]  Exactly.
[01:04:18.644 --> 01:04:19.244]  No problem.
[01:04:20.325 --> 01:04:22.947]  We can survive it as long as we get our 28 bribes.
[01:04:23.067 --> 01:04:24.569]  I didn't say we'd get a hair must.
[01:04:25.865 --> 01:04:26.606]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:26.786 --> 01:04:27.186]  That was it.
[01:04:27.326 --> 01:04:28.147]  Exactly.
[01:04:28.507 --> 01:04:29.328]  We're living this for real.
[01:04:29.348 --> 01:04:33.090]  There's people that are actually game-planning this in the Biden administration right now.
[01:04:33.611 --> 01:04:38.114]  And so we've got to be consciously, consistently attentive.
[01:04:38.214 --> 01:04:38.815]  I mean, J.D.
[01:04:38.835 --> 01:04:39.916]  Vance won in Ohio.
[01:04:40.196 --> 01:04:47.261]  He won because he chose to be anti-war, chose to be anti-no-fly zone, said we'd have no business getting involved in this.
[01:04:47.481 --> 01:04:49.843]  We need to worry about our own border, not the Ukrainian one.
[01:04:49.863 --> 01:04:50.143]  That's right.
[01:04:50.163 --> 01:04:52.265]  It's insanely popular to not have war with Russia.
[01:04:52.705 --> 01:04:54.646]  It's insanely popular to control our border.
[01:04:55.006 --> 01:04:57.548]  It's incredibly popular to not devalue the currency.
[01:04:58.208 --> 01:05:03.911]  Everything the left does is unpopular and they went to the White House Press Correspondence Center and make jokes about that.
[01:05:03.951 --> 01:05:04.552]  They know that!
[01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:06.238]  Absolutely.
[01:05:06.278 --> 01:05:11.363]  And that's why I think, I'm hopeful that people like Kathy Barnett make a surge in the Pennsylvania Senate race.
[01:05:11.783 --> 01:05:13.124]  She's running against globalists.
[01:05:13.184 --> 01:05:19.330]  She's running, you know, unlike Dr. Oz, an unfortunate endorsement by President Trump because of his long-standing friendship with him.
[01:05:19.671 --> 01:05:23.935]  But Oz is a guy who voted in 2018 in Turkey, not the United States.
[01:05:24.355 --> 01:05:26.296]  That's not who we need in the United States Senate.
[01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:39.641]  We need someone like Kathy Barnett, someone who's advancing a populist cause, who's advancing and supporting that populist cause, who's a legitimate populist, not a fake one, not a pretend one, not another MAGA pretend candidate, but an actual MAGA candidate.
[01:05:40.021 --> 01:05:42.942]  And maybe we'll see Pennsylvania replicate what just happened in Ohio.
[01:05:43.242 --> 01:05:45.903]  Because the populist base does not want any more war.
[01:05:46.163 --> 01:05:48.444]  The populist base doesn't want to debase our currency.
[01:05:48.684 --> 01:05:50.845]  The populist base doesn't want to destroy our border.
[01:05:51.105 --> 01:05:54.426]  The populist base doesn't want another fake pandemic to lock us down again.
[01:05:54.847 --> 01:06:09.072]  So that's what we need, is we need more populists, and we need real populists to reform our elections, to keep them clean, and to keep them honest, to simply comply with the same standards again that international election observers, we in the United States, require of international elections.
[01:06:09.352 --> 01:06:11.195]  We should at least have the same standards here.
[01:06:11.495 --> 01:06:16.962]  And that's where 2000 Mules is a great film for documenting just this one aspect of the fraud.
[01:06:17.342 --> 01:06:28.176]  And it's a reminder we must continually be diligent in focusing change in the court of public opinion so that legislatures take the remedy that we need to make sure our elections have integrity and honesty.
[01:06:28.697 --> 01:06:36.667]  Well Barnes, the longer I know you, the more I respect you because I remember being with you in Atlanta and you said, listen, they're going to say it's digital.
[01:06:36.747 --> 01:06:37.188]  It's not.
[01:06:37.308 --> 01:06:38.209]  It's all mules.
[01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:39.351]  Use that term.
[01:06:39.791 --> 01:06:41.533]  You said it's people bringing in fake ballots.
[01:06:42.884 --> 01:06:45.145]  Trump agreed with you, but his people didn't.
[01:06:45.165 --> 01:06:50.407]  It was all this pie-in-the-sky stuff, and now it's proven.
[01:06:50.427 --> 01:06:51.008]  That is so huge.
[01:06:51.028 --> 01:06:51.968]  We're going to go to break, though.
[01:06:52.428 --> 01:06:59.632]  I want to talk COVID, because they got new lockdowns planned, and all this new stuff's coming out, and Bill Gates wants this World Government-UN Treaty.
[01:06:59.992 --> 01:07:04.174]  I'm going to talk about how we had that off at the past, because we had great victory.
[01:07:04.194 --> 01:07:06.995]  The world was awakening, so they backed off as we knew they would.
[01:07:08.362 --> 01:07:10.924]  How do we not let all the gains we've had be lost?
[01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:13.586]  This is so critical to all your futures.
[01:07:13.706 --> 01:07:23.472]  Please, tell everybody you know, now, on every platform you can, whether it's Gab or Twitter or Rumble, I don't care what it is, just spread the word, the freedom is live.
[01:07:27.555 --> 01:07:32.078]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:07:32.599 --> 01:07:34.100]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:36.337 --> 01:07:38.600]  So, we're not weather forecasters.
[01:07:38.740 --> 01:07:41.903]  We're political, economic, cultural forecasters.
[01:07:42.444 --> 01:07:48.911]  And I could show you a hundred articles and give you my view on this all day, but Robert Barnes, I really respect him and his view on this.
[01:07:48.971 --> 01:07:51.113]  So, Barnes, look into that crystal ball.
[01:07:52.134 --> 01:07:55.855]  And we see a dying political global system in deep trouble trying to start wars.
[01:07:56.296 --> 01:07:57.956]  We see the dollar in deep trouble.
[01:07:58.036 --> 01:08:00.177]  We see massive inflation.
[01:08:00.817 --> 01:08:01.497]  All of this happened.
[01:08:01.517 --> 01:08:05.719]  We see arrogance at the National Press Dinner making jokes about how they're enslaving us.
[01:08:06.239 --> 01:08:07.259]  These are not good signs.
[01:08:07.399 --> 01:08:12.021]  What do you expect this dying system to do and what can we do to stop it?
[01:08:13.311 --> 01:08:32.823]  Well, I mean, I see it right now in the one of the biggest cases, if not the biggest case against Big Pharma related to this COVID vaccine, which is my case, Brooke Jackson against Pfizer for defrauding the government of billions of dollars based on fraudulently falsifying the data that was submitted to them about this vaccine.
[01:08:32.863 --> 01:08:36.525]  We're seeing that disclosed in the FOIA disclosures that they tried to hide for 75 years.
[01:08:37.646 --> 01:08:44.429]  We're seeing more of the great work by Del Bigtree and Aaron Seery, which detail and demonstrate all the information they knew.
[01:08:44.669 --> 01:08:47.630]  All of this is confirming what Brooke Jackson said.
[01:08:47.650 --> 01:08:50.752]  She was the first whistleblower to blow the whistle on all of this.
[01:08:51.472 --> 01:08:53.053]  The complaint is now unsealed.
[01:08:53.713 --> 01:08:56.194]  We're going to have a hearing this month in May.
[01:08:57.015 --> 01:09:04.478]  And announcing here for the first time, I'm bringing together a team of lawyers from across the nation to join in on this case.
[01:09:05.258 --> 01:09:08.339]  Because there are dozens of lawyers on the opposite side.
[01:09:08.699 --> 01:09:12.281]  Pfizer and the other related entities have lawyered up big time.
[01:09:12.841 --> 01:09:16.202]  And so they are trying to seek a complete stop of all discovery.
[01:09:16.502 --> 01:09:22.624]  They don't want there to be any discovery in the case, any information to be turned over, anything else just like they tried in the FOIA case.
[01:09:23.004 --> 01:09:48.134]   We'll be litigating that this month, because this case is the tip of the spear for unwinding what they did, uncovering what they did, and getting some public justice for what they did, so that they can't do it again, because as Bill Gates admitted this past week, Bill Gates, in fact, knew all along, or at least knew very early on, that this vaccine and that this virus wasn't as dangerous as he pretended it was.
[01:09:48.194 --> 01:09:48.934]  I got the clip here.
[01:09:48.954 --> 01:09:49.755]  In fact, guys, find it.
[01:09:49.815 --> 01:09:51.876]  I think it's in Friday's clips.
[01:09:51.916 --> 01:09:55.059]  But Bill Gates says it's only as dangerous as the flu.
[01:09:55.499 --> 01:09:57.721]  So he's now trying to walk it back.
[01:09:58.923 --> 01:09:59.383]  Absolutely!
[01:09:59.683 --> 01:10:03.585]  Because he wants the next virus to be more dangerous to justify and excuse.
[01:10:03.625 --> 01:10:05.386]  He went on to say that.
[01:10:05.446 --> 01:10:05.826]  Exactly.
[01:10:05.866 --> 01:10:11.669]  He said, I got the clip here, he said, this was only as bad as a flu, but don't worry, the next one's much worse.
[01:10:12.710 --> 01:10:13.110]  Exactly.
[01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:13.890]  And that's predictive.
[01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:15.891]  How does he manage to be so predictive?
[01:10:16.151 --> 01:10:17.612]  He wanted this one to be much worse.
[01:10:17.972 --> 01:10:20.053]  They just lied about how dangerous it was.
[01:10:20.453 --> 01:10:26.736]  And who is the number one private funder, funds as much to the World Health Organization as the United States government does?
[01:10:27.096 --> 01:10:28.117]  It's the Gates Foundation.
[01:10:28.397 --> 01:10:40.980]  Who's the number one funder of the, oh, a lot of these modelers out of the University of Washington and out of the Imperial College in UK that created these bogus charts and bogus stats to terrorize the world into locking down and doing... And that's been his latest statement.
[01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:44.121]  You must not question the independent science modelers.
[01:10:44.501 --> 01:10:47.122]  Since you mentioned it, here's the clip of him admitting it was basically the flu.
[01:10:47.482 --> 01:10:51.223]  But don't worry, he said in another speech, something far worse is coming.
[01:10:51.243 --> 01:10:51.603]  Here it is.
[01:10:52.602 --> 01:10:58.611]  It wasn't until early February when I was in a meeting that experts at the Foundation said, there's no way.
[01:11:00.453 --> 01:11:07.203]  There's been too much travel without diagnosis for us to contain this.
[01:11:07.924 --> 01:11:11.986]  And then, at that point, we didn't really understand the fatality rate.
[01:11:12.166 --> 01:11:22.029]  You know, we didn't understand that it's a fairly low fatality rate, and that it's a disease mainly of the elderly, kind of like flu is, although a bit different than that.
[01:11:22.489 --> 01:11:32.373]  So that was a pretty scary period, where the world didn't go on alert, including the United States, nearly as fast as it needed to.
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.367]  Even though we had the experts on and said all that beforehand.
[01:11:36.868 --> 01:11:41.941]  Amazing admission that he's all over, as you mentioned, saying, oh, but don't worry, something far more deadly is coming.
[01:11:43.237 --> 01:11:48.198]  And that's the plan, and that's how we have to continue to fight this in the court of public opinion, continue to fight this in the courts of law.
[01:11:48.558 --> 01:11:52.159]  That's why Brooke Jackson's suit is so significant and so critical and so essential.
[01:11:52.499 --> 01:11:54.839]  She was very brave and very bold at coming forward.
[01:11:54.859 --> 01:11:56.699]  Yeah, for those that don't know, that was like six months ago.
[01:11:56.719 --> 01:11:59.420]  You told me probably, yeah, I got this big Texas Pfizer whistleblower.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:01.000]  That was the first big case.
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:01.920]  Now more are happening.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:02.540]  Great job.
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:04.061]  I mean, it's huge.
[01:12:04.141 --> 01:12:04.561]  It's huge.
[01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:10.062]  And everything she said is now proven, and there are admissions of blood clots, heart attacks, covering up the trials.
[01:12:10.102 --> 01:12:11.902]  Didn't do phase three trials.
[01:12:12.062 --> 01:12:12.402]  Amazing.
[01:12:13.519 --> 01:12:14.701]  I mean, she took great risk.
[01:12:14.741 --> 01:12:17.524]  I mean, she was getting direct phone calls from Pfizer's lawyers.
[01:12:17.884 --> 01:12:21.409]  She was getting certified mail that had been opened before she received it.
[01:12:21.769 --> 01:12:26.635]  I mean, she was seeing a lot of anomalies that were evidence of surveillance, private surveillance on her.
[01:12:26.935 --> 01:12:29.278]  She took a great risk by blowing the whistle on this.
[01:12:29.899 --> 01:12:32.382]  Took a great risk to her career, took a great personal risk.
[01:12:33.022 --> 01:12:42.845]  And now she's being vindicated in full, not only by the scope and scale of this case that we brought on her behalf, and on the behalf of every United States citizen.
[01:12:42.865 --> 01:12:49.567]  This is a key TAM action, so it's brought on behalf of the American people, but it's also being confirmed by all these critical Pfizer leaks.
[01:12:49.947 --> 01:13:00.959]  That are now finally coming out in the FOIA disclosures, and they're showing that they knew a lot higher death rate than they had disclosed, much higher risk rate than they had disclosed, much less benefit.
[01:13:00.999 --> 01:13:05.744]  I mean, some of their data suggests that they were only about 12% effective for a short period of time.
[01:13:06.124 --> 01:13:08.665]  So they knew that the vaccine wouldn't stop this.
[01:13:08.705 --> 01:13:10.405]  So, I mean, this wasn't even a vaccine!
[01:13:10.825 --> 01:13:19.628]  I'm litigating with Bobby Kennedy in two different cases on behalf of Children's Health Defense against the FDA, both in the Sixth Circuit and there in the Western District of Texas, right up in Waco.
[01:13:19.988 --> 01:13:24.029]  We're litigating trying to stop this from being implemented for young children.
[01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.549]  That's right.
[01:13:24.710 --> 01:13:30.775]  They're acting like the fight's over because they know we were building the forces politically and economically and culturally and legally to beat them.
[01:13:31.216 --> 01:13:33.038]  The fight is bigger now than ever.
[01:13:33.098 --> 01:13:35.019]  We're trying to stop their next assault, folks.
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:36.541]  That's why this is so critical.
[01:13:36.581 --> 01:13:39.724]  So let me ask you the 35,000 foot view here, Barnes.
[01:13:41.786 --> 01:13:44.809]  How would you describe the Globalist position right now and how it's going for them?
[01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:47.672]  And again, how else do you think they're going to strike at us?
[01:13:48.973 --> 01:13:51.915]  Well, it explains what 2008 was really all about.
[01:13:51.935 --> 01:13:54.037]  It was why did they steal the 2020 election?
[01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:57.299]  Because they wanted global war with Ukraine.
[01:13:57.319 --> 01:14:04.324]  They wanted to use Ukraine as a proxy to take down anybody threatening the globalist new order of Klaus Schwab and George Soros and the rest.
[01:14:04.744 --> 01:14:13.291]  And they wanted to be able to do this, get away with what they did in this past lockdowns and vaccines, but so that they can do it again in the future.
[01:14:13.751 --> 01:14:16.253]  And that's why it was so critical to take Trump out.
[01:14:16.833 --> 01:14:25.517]  To remove him as the obstacle to global war, as the obstacle to another lockdown, and to exposing their malfeasance and misconduct.
[01:14:25.958 --> 01:14:30.940]  This Justice Department is the most weaponized Justice Department in American political history.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:36.943]  Biden has done with this Justice Department what they accused Nixon of doing, that Nixon never got close to achieving or attaining.
[01:14:37.323 --> 01:14:45.287]  He is doing it, not only in covering up for Hunter Biden's crimes, going after Project Veritas and James O'Keefe, but in this case, where is the Justice Department?
[01:14:45.567 --> 01:14:47.789]  Brooke Jackson detailed all of these issues.
[01:14:47.829 --> 01:14:53.534]  These issues are now being confirmed by the FOIA litigation, and yet the Justice Department is still sitting on its hands.
[01:14:53.894 --> 01:15:01.501]  The Justice Department should be supporting Brooke Jackson's case against Pfizer, should be assisting this case, and instead they're hiding in the background.
[01:15:01.741 --> 01:15:08.067]  And while all of this is coming out, they're trying to target under five children with these poison shots.
[01:15:09.395 --> 01:15:09.796]  Absolutely!
[01:15:09.816 --> 01:15:10.737]  They want to give it to babies!
[01:15:10.757 --> 01:15:11.718]  They want to give it to babies!
[01:15:12.018 --> 01:15:14.861]  If they can't kill them in the womb, they want to kill them when they come out of the womb.
[01:15:15.161 --> 01:15:19.445]  Just look at California legislation promoting killing actual infanticide.
[01:15:19.706 --> 01:15:24.771]  There's a reason why Roe v. Wade kept referencing the infanticide decisions of Rome.
[01:15:25.071 --> 01:15:27.554]  It's because this was a eugenicist decision.
[01:15:27.614 --> 01:15:30.477]  Look at Elizabeth Warren's most recent quote and tweet.
[01:15:30.837 --> 01:15:35.164]  Where she says, hey, abortion's important for poor people and minority people.
[01:15:35.424 --> 01:15:36.265]  Why does she say that?
[01:15:36.586 --> 01:15:39.650]  She says that because this was a eugenicist-driven agenda.
[01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:44.197]  And they're losing the power to force abortions on unwilling populations.
[01:15:44.477 --> 01:15:47.041]  They're losing the power to force these mass vaccines.
[01:15:47.301 --> 01:15:47.561]  I agree.
[01:15:47.381 --> 01:15:50.641]   quote unquote fake vaccines, 'cause they're not legally vaccines.
[01:15:50.641 --> 01:15:53.921]   These vaccines on mass populations, including very young children,
[01:15:53.921 --> 01:15:58.961]   despite all the health data, and they wanted a third world war with Ukraine.
[01:15:58.961 --> 01:16:02.761]   And all of those agendas are being derailed and sidetracked despite their standing in the election.
[01:16:02.761 --> 01:16:07.001]   I agree, so in one minute to break, how are they gonna try to grab victory
[01:16:07.001 --> 01:16:08.201]  from the jaws of defeat?
[01:16:08.201 --> 01:16:13.441]   Well, you see, they're gonna do things like leak a Supreme Court draft opinion,
[01:16:13.441 --> 01:16:18.181]   and then engage in Antifa style terror tactics outside the homes of these Supreme Court justices,
[01:16:18.181 --> 01:16:22.841]   hoping that these Supreme Court justices fold and capitulate and reverse on their decisions.
[01:16:23.001 --> 01:16:24.662]  I mean, it is mind-numbing.
[01:16:24.882 --> 01:16:28.684]  I mean, if any conservatives were doing that, they would have been locked up yesterday.
[01:16:29.024 --> 01:16:32.345]  But here, these people are being rewarded, being encouraged, being incentivized.
[01:16:32.365 --> 01:16:33.466]  The media is celebrating it.
[01:16:33.746 --> 01:16:35.127]  Joe Biden is excusing it.
[01:16:35.387 --> 01:16:36.747]  The left is tolerating it.
[01:16:37.048 --> 01:16:37.988]  This is what's happening.
[01:16:38.688 --> 01:16:45.172]  They're going to resort to street theater and deep state, deep fake, false flags in the Ukrainian conflict.
[01:16:45.592 --> 01:16:51.135]  Between the two, hope to derail this populist rebellion against their globalist agenda.
[01:16:51.415 --> 01:16:57.018]  All right, Barnes, I want to look at food shortages, all these food plants, including Wal-Mart, supply centers blowing up.
[01:16:57.618 --> 01:17:01.080]  I want to look at the disinformation board and more in the final segment with Robert Barnes.
[01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:06.903]  And then, Owen, the Cut Destroyer Shroyer has got a gigantic show lined up for you.
[01:17:07.863 --> 01:17:08.463]  6 to 8 p.m.
[01:17:08.342 --> 01:17:26.342]  Central tonight.
[01:17:26.342 --> 01:17:30.943]   You know in this last segment I got a few big issues I want to hit on the Alex Jones
[01:17:30.943 --> 01:17:32.822]  show but I want to bring this up because.
[01:17:32.822 --> 01:17:34.221]  (upbeat music)
[01:17:34.352 --> 01:17:35.413]  I do follow Robert Barnes.
[01:17:36.073 --> 01:17:36.934]  I watch his show.
[01:17:36.954 --> 01:17:39.156]  He does every few days with another great lawyer.
[01:17:39.476 --> 01:17:40.597]  I follow his work.
[01:17:40.657 --> 01:17:41.598]  It's always informative.
[01:17:41.638 --> 01:17:42.219]  I learn stuff.
[01:17:43.139 --> 01:17:48.844]  But I saw you get into the Democratic Party-funded lawsuits against me and really just exposed what it was a few days ago.
[01:17:49.945 --> 01:17:54.449]  And I normally don't spend a lot of time covering what we're going through because listeners already know it.
[01:17:54.469 --> 01:17:55.210]  They're supporting us.
[01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:57.952]  But it's a blueprint for the future.
[01:17:59.413 --> 01:18:05.442]   And so, you know, I hired some big Top law firms for our limited bankruptcy.
[01:18:07.263 --> 01:18:10.964]  And right after it started two weeks ago, they called me and they sent me transcripts.
[01:18:10.984 --> 01:18:12.505]  They said, we've never seen this before.
[01:18:12.965 --> 01:18:14.266]  We believe in the deep state now.
[01:18:15.046 --> 01:18:19.888]  We've had the Justice Department call and say, the Biden administration says you're not allowed to support him.
[01:18:20.388 --> 01:18:32.453]  They actually called the judge's lawyer and they called the the trustees lawyers who are retired, the former judge of Austin and Schmidt.
[01:18:33.877 --> 01:18:35.658]  And said, it's policy of the U.S.
[01:18:35.698 --> 01:18:38.540]  government, like I'm Russia, that he doesn't have access to the courts.
[01:18:38.580 --> 01:18:39.501]  So that blew him away.
[01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:40.842]  And that actually woke him up.
[01:18:42.363 --> 01:18:43.123]  And I knew this would happen.
[01:18:43.563 --> 01:18:48.066]  Because these state courts are so rigged, as you pointed out, Soros elected judges.
[01:18:50.888 --> 01:18:54.911]  He's got 900 plus district attorneys, a bunch of county attorneys, 20 plus U.S.
[01:18:54.971 --> 01:18:59.614]  attorneys, more than that, hell, and a whole bunch of state attorney generals.
[01:19:00.649 --> 01:19:03.351]  And then you can put the headline up of Reuters, you name it.
[01:19:03.791 --> 01:19:07.853]  Justice Department is against Alex Jones's bankruptcy.
[01:19:07.913 --> 01:19:10.255]  Justice Department trying to stop Alex Jones's bankruptcy.
[01:19:10.275 --> 01:19:11.015]  Those are the headlines.
[01:19:11.435 --> 01:19:12.476]  I showed them in the first hour.
[01:19:13.056 --> 01:19:15.017]  We can put them back up on screen for TV viewers.
[01:19:15.037 --> 01:19:21.781]  But then I confirmed this week, we're not going to release it yet, but this is something you should be involved in.
[01:19:21.801 --> 01:19:22.642]  We should really build it up.
[01:19:22.682 --> 01:19:30.816]   It's a big deal that we always knew Soros was involved, but they're not even hiding it in Texas.
[01:19:32.657 --> 01:19:36.439]  And that's Bloomberg right there with the Justice Department saying my bankruptcy is not good.
[01:19:36.459 --> 01:19:40.200]  But you can type in, DOJ challenges Alex Jones' bankruptcy.
[01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:41.261]  Since when does that happen?
[01:19:42.521 --> 01:19:48.104]  So, how big is it that Soros isn't even trying to hide this?
[01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:50.865]  To me, this is a major rallying point.
[01:19:51.365 --> 01:20:12.081]   Why are they, because I know we have a big show and a great audience and great guests, but why are they so obsessed that we now have evidence that's going to come out soon Of over $10 million spent by Soros to do this, what does he think that's going to look like when all that comes out and that they're now openly trying to threaten bankruptcy federal judges?
[01:20:12.121 --> 01:20:15.805]  I mean, these people, I guess they know they control the Justice Department, so why do they care?
[01:20:15.825 --> 01:20:16.626]  But this is getting crazy.
[01:20:17.861 --> 01:20:22.242]  This is a complete weaponization of the Justice Department for politicized, partisan purposes.
[01:20:22.582 --> 01:20:27.103]  I mean, when's the last time we've seen a Justice Department go after a reporter?
[01:20:27.123 --> 01:20:35.424]  This is the same Justice Department that's busy trying to extradite Julian Assange for exposing deep state crimes during the Obama administration and going after Julian Assange.
[01:20:35.684 --> 01:20:45.546]  The same deep state apparatus going after James O'Keefe merely because he possessed a diary of a daughter of a president that exposed that president in a highly questionable world.
[01:20:45.566 --> 01:20:47.146]  That he gave to the police and didn't publish.
[01:20:48.268 --> 01:20:48.689]  Exactly!
[01:20:48.709 --> 01:20:50.991]  I mean, he didn't even go public with it.
[01:20:51.251 --> 01:20:54.554]  Basically, they have become... Mike Cernovich put it this way the other day.
[01:20:55.095 --> 01:21:00.180]  The FBI has become the private Stasi, the private KGB, the private secret police.
[01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:02.242]  In fact, I call it confession through projection.
[01:21:02.562 --> 01:21:07.787]  It's like you listen to whatever Ukraine or the West is saying about the war and assume that they say the Russians are doing it.
[01:21:07.807 --> 01:21:09.729]  It's usually what's happening to Ukrainians.
[01:21:09.929 --> 01:21:11.689]  The same thing is happening here.
[01:21:11.689 --> 01:21:15.088]   Whatever they accused Trump of doing is what they were up to.
[01:21:15.088 --> 01:21:17.807]  Corruption overseas, corruption involving family members.
[01:21:17.807 --> 01:21:20.847]  I mean just look at the password of Hunter Biden's laptop.
[01:21:20.847 --> 01:21:22.608]  The guy's a complete degenerate.
[01:21:22.608 --> 01:21:23.608]  This is the nature of it.
[01:21:23.608 --> 01:21:25.448]  We have a degenerate presidency.
[01:21:25.448 --> 01:21:29.088]  We have a degenerate president who is a dementia candidate.
[01:21:29.088 --> 01:21:30.529]  So let's expand on that.
[01:21:30.529 --> 01:21:34.189]   Just like Hitler started bombing civilian targets thinking it would make the British
[01:21:34.189 --> 01:21:40.529]   give up, I'm finding messing with judges, messing with law, is actually making them
[01:21:41.271 --> 01:21:42.533]  It's not having the effect they thought.
[01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:46.210]  Well yeah, I mean the goal has been just pure intimidation tactics.
[01:21:46.230 --> 01:21:47.151]  It's the only thing they know.
[01:21:47.211 --> 01:21:54.014]  Just like the intimidation tactics they took with Russia, thought they could shut down Russia's economy, thought they could change Russia's governance, simply with these tactics.
[01:21:54.054 --> 01:21:59.776]  It's the same tactics and techniques, but it's the complete dangerous, partisan, politicized, weaponization of the Justice Department.
[01:21:59.836 --> 01:22:02.357]  And what's dangerous, Barnes, is that they don't quit.
[01:22:02.397 --> 01:22:03.778]  When it fails, they double down.
[01:22:03.838 --> 01:22:05.539]  So what's the double down gonna look like?
[01:22:06.664 --> 01:22:10.248]  I mean, they're going to keep accelerating and escalating until they get a rigged outcome.
[01:22:10.768 --> 01:22:17.395]  And the problem they have, if they had confidence in the merits of their case, then they wouldn't be using these shenanigans.
[01:22:17.435 --> 01:22:18.737]  They wouldn't be having the U.S.
[01:22:18.777 --> 01:22:26.885]  trustee interfere in a bankruptcy in a highly questionable manner to try to prevent a party from the legal rights and remedies bankruptcy affords.
[01:22:27.145 --> 01:22:33.371]  Which, by the way, is only an option because the plaintiffs chose to sue entities they knew didn't have any assets.
[01:22:34.352 --> 01:22:35.373]  So that shows the scale of it.
[01:22:35.473 --> 01:22:38.536]  If they had confidence in their case, they wouldn't use these shenanigans.
[01:22:38.556 --> 01:22:39.356]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:22:39.376 --> 01:22:42.179]  They're saying there's hundreds of millions of dollars in these entities.
[01:22:42.599 --> 01:22:44.161]  We're maxed out, don't have any money.
[01:22:44.441 --> 01:22:45.942]  So I'm like, okay, we'll show them.
[01:22:46.483 --> 01:22:47.304]  And then they're pissed!
[01:22:48.402 --> 01:22:52.567]  Well, because the whole case was premised on a fiction.
[01:22:53.027 --> 01:22:59.935]  A fiction based on a sort of Mike Myers style latest version of a delusional interpretation of Alex Jones.
[01:23:00.395 --> 01:23:08.104]  And they want to pretend that the Infowars audience is this deluded audience when in fact it's one of the most informed audiences in the entire world.
[01:23:08.544 --> 01:23:12.327]  Robert, you were involved in Discovery and our finances, because I don't judge myself by money.
[01:23:12.367 --> 01:23:13.287]  I spend it almost all.
[01:23:13.327 --> 01:23:16.690]  I've got a decent house, a nice car, health care, but I don't worship money.
[01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:18.711]  I'm not trying to pile up money.
[01:23:18.751 --> 01:23:21.253]  Last time you checked, how much money does Alex Jones have?
[01:23:21.293 --> 01:23:22.854]  They keep claiming I have hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:23:23.114 --> 01:23:24.015]  I don't have five million dollars.
[01:23:25.373 --> 01:23:30.556]  All of these entities they knew didn't, that are in bankruptcy, they knew didn't have it from the very beginning of Discovery.
[01:23:30.856 --> 01:23:31.976]  We sat down and showed them.
[01:23:31.996 --> 01:23:32.797]  There's nothing there.
[01:23:32.857 --> 01:23:33.577]  There's nothing in there.
[01:23:33.597 --> 01:23:35.818]  They knew it and said you should dismiss them.
[01:23:36.159 --> 01:23:38.480]  You know, why is Owen Schroer being sued as part of all this?
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:42.422]  This is purely lawfare, and it's politically motivated lawfare.
[01:23:42.442 --> 01:23:48.125]  And I'm not putting Owen down, but in Discovery, he has like $50,000 in the bank.
[01:23:48.225 --> 01:23:49.746]  I mean, it's all lies.
[01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:55.547]  Okay, at every single level, and it has to be because it was built on a lie, based on a lie.
[01:23:55.868 --> 01:24:02.529]  The story had to be that this was a fake news station, not the tip of the spear for independent information.
[01:24:02.869 --> 01:24:08.031]  Who was at the very top of saying that the pandemic lockdown was bad politics, bad policy?
[01:24:08.311 --> 01:24:09.793]  And they were lying about the data.
[01:24:09.933 --> 01:24:10.675]  It was Infowars.
[01:24:10.975 --> 01:24:13.559]  Who is at the tip of the spear for saying this election was stolen?
[01:24:13.919 --> 01:24:14.680]  It was Infowars.
[01:24:14.921 --> 01:24:20.449]  Who is at the tip of the spear saying the war in Ukraine is meant to escalate to World War III and we have no business being there?
[01:24:20.609 --> 01:24:21.370]  It was Infowars.
[01:24:21.710 --> 01:24:23.473]  That's why they have to silence Infowars.
[01:24:23.773 --> 01:24:25.997]  That's why they have to shame the Infowars audience.
[01:24:26.277 --> 01:24:30.804]  They can't, if they believed in their case, they would have a trial on the merits with a jury.
[01:24:30.825 --> 01:24:36.754]  And let's expand, they've defaulted and you saw the filing where in Texas they say we can't talk or bring up the First Amendment.
[01:24:37.054 --> 01:24:38.617]  I mean it's beyond a kangaroo trial.
[01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:40.551]  Oh, completely.
[01:24:40.631 --> 01:24:43.314]  I mean, again, if they have confidence, why are they scared of an Austin jury?
[01:24:43.695 --> 01:24:45.156]  A liberal Austin jury pool?
[01:24:45.457 --> 01:24:47.880]  Why are they scared of a liberal Connecticut jury pool?
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:55.008]  They know that even those jury pools, when they see the actual facts in the case, will not write big checks of the kind that they demand.
[01:24:55.289 --> 01:24:58.773]  Will not bankrupt Interpol Wars fundamentally and functionally moving forward.
[01:24:59.153 --> 01:25:21.854]  So that's why they have to create a fake case based on a fake narrative and use procedural tricks so that, I mean, InfoWars has been denied the right to bring motions to dismiss, the right to bring motions to summary judgment, the right to bring anti-slap motions, and now denied the right to a trial on the merits, and now they're trying to deny them even bankruptcy law protection.
[01:25:22.154 --> 01:25:28.021]  That's the scale and scope of this politicized, weaponized mechanism to come after InfoWars.
[01:25:28.341 --> 01:25:29.822]  And it's because of the power of the audience.
[01:25:30.223 --> 01:25:35.749]  The power of the audience that has continued to keep InfoWars alive and afloat financially and socially.
[01:25:35.769 --> 01:25:36.209]  Well that's right.
[01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:37.631]  What does it say about the power structure?
[01:25:37.671 --> 01:25:39.333]  These aren't the actions of a strong group.
[01:25:41.022 --> 01:25:42.122]  Well, they thought they would crush it.
[01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:48.124]  They thought your audience was a dumb, naive, defrauded, deceived audience.
[01:25:48.384 --> 01:25:51.345]  Not one of the most informed audiences in the world.
[01:25:51.605 --> 01:25:55.026]  Not an audience that would stay invested in InfoWars no matter what happened.
[01:25:55.346 --> 01:25:59.968]  That would continue to get good products at good prices while keeping InfoWars functionally afloat.
[01:26:00.328 --> 01:26:01.308]  And where does that matter?
[01:26:02.469 --> 01:26:09.131]  Where do you go to find out the real information about a war in Ukraine at the beginning when all the mainstream media, including Fox, is pushing lies?
[01:26:09.411 --> 01:26:09.971]  It's InfoWars.
[01:26:10.291 --> 01:26:13.895]  Where do you go to find out that the lockdown is bad policy and bad politics?
[01:26:14.115 --> 01:26:15.576]  And they're lying about this pandemic.
[01:26:15.817 --> 01:26:17.538]  When Fox News was fully on board.
[01:26:17.779 --> 01:26:20.001]  When key people connected to Trump were even on board.
[01:26:20.021 --> 01:26:27.869]  So let me ask you in closing, what are they going to do now that they've launched this attack and all it's creating is more positive?
[01:26:28.209 --> 01:26:29.450]  I've never seen so much support.
[01:26:29.490 --> 01:26:30.852]  What are they going to do as it backfires?
[01:26:32.577 --> 01:26:34.639]  Unfortunately, it's going to be more and more dangerous.
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:38.164]  I mean, they're going to escalate, like what we're seeing in Ukraine.
[01:26:38.544 --> 01:26:42.369]  I mean, you have people seriously considering and contemplating actual nuclear war.
[01:26:42.589 --> 01:26:44.351]  It is, as you described, pure mad.
[01:26:44.412 --> 01:26:46.094]  That's why it's called mutually assured destruction.
[01:26:46.562 --> 01:26:57.815]  So you're going to see continued efforts to weaponize the entire process so that InfoWars never gets a trial on the merits, and efforts to crush it and nuke it are the same as what they're thinking on a global military scale.
[01:26:57.835 --> 01:26:58.116]  That's right.
[01:26:58.156 --> 01:27:03.622]  InfoWars is a microcosm of breaking the law, the leak of the Supreme Court ruling.
[01:27:03.823 --> 01:27:05.384]  It shows there's no rules now.
[01:27:05.424 --> 01:27:06.566]  They're just going completely crazy.
[01:27:07.529 --> 01:27:27.878]  Just like what happened in the election, just like what happened with the pandemic, just like what happened in the Ukrainian conflict, just like what happened with the leak, just like what happened with the SCOTUS leak, just like what happened with Project Veritas, they are going to break all the rules and deny the protection of the law and deny the remedies of the Constitution to Infowars because Infowars is the tip of the spear at breaking through their propaganda lines.
[01:27:27.918 --> 01:27:29.418]  Alright, Barnes, people search your name.
[01:27:29.458 --> 01:27:30.759]  You're everywhere on Twitter.
[01:27:30.799 --> 01:27:31.639]  You've got a great show.
[01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:32.399]  You owe it to yourself.
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:33.420]  Thank you so much.
[01:27:34.386 --> 01:27:34.967]  Hey, glad to be here.
