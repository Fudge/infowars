[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  [Music]
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  [Music]
[00:00:28.914 --> 00:00:34.598]  Last night I couldn't sleep, and I woke up about 2 a.m.
[00:00:34.698 --> 00:00:36.780]  and stayed up the rest of the morning.
[00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:53.352]  And I already intended to come in to the broadcast today and cover this subject, and then going through the huge stacks of news and videos, the very topic I was gonna hit appeared in the countless reams of reports I have them print off for me to scan over.
[00:00:55.393 --> 00:01:04.538]  And so what I want to talk about at least in the first hour today on this Thursday live June 2nd edition is really what's happening on this planet.
[00:01:04.558 --> 00:01:07.980]  So I'm going to say it very succinctly and very simply.
[00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:19.487]  There is a covert operation hitting us from dozens of different angles that is not just designed to eradicate all human life on the planet.
[00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:38.034]  But there is a worldwide secret agency program spraying, quote, biocides into the atmosphere that are added to jet fuel to poison and kill and mutate all life on Earth.
[00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:42.136]  Now, what's incredible is we've known about this for a long time.
[00:01:43.356 --> 00:01:47.118]  And it's not just geoengineering, it's not just weather control going on.
[00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:56.323]  And then I noticed this morning a big Ministry of Defense report out of Spain and the EU, complete with UN documents.
[00:01:58.444 --> 00:01:59.644]  We translated the documents.
[00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:01.585]  We have them here.
[00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:15.852]  And it's what we already knew, but it's the total admission of how the system, out of one side of its mouth, denies this giant geoengineering program is going on.
[00:02:18.183 --> 00:02:33.327]  But out of the other side of their mouth says, yeah Bill Gates is control the weather and in the case of the EU and Spain, we're spraying biocides on you that kill life.
[00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:36.368]  But we're doing it to stop COVID-19.
[00:02:38.604 --> 00:02:49.973]  Now, there was a Nobel Prize won with the idea of adding aluminum dioxide and barium salts and other things to jet fuel in 1992 to create nuclei to, quote, spray a smoke stream in the atmosphere to protect the Earth.
[00:02:51.815 --> 00:02:58.701]  And that was the cover given to the bureaucracies around the world of the secret Manhattan-style project of why they were doing this.
[00:03:00.862 --> 00:03:03.785]  But the weather modification is only one small facet of it.
[00:03:05.151 --> 00:03:13.753]  They now admit in UN, EU, and Spanish documents we have right here today, that these chemicals are meant to kill life.
[00:03:14.873 --> 00:03:24.315]  And so when people in the government asked about that in Spain last year, the government then wrote a report to them saying, yeah, it's to stop COVID.
[00:03:25.715 --> 00:03:28.596]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is ridiculous.
[00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:51.941]  You add to that the transgenderism, and in California half the kids identifying as gay or transgender, you add to that the attack on the family, you add to that the poison injections masquerading as vaccines, you add to that all the GMO food, nanotech being added to the food supply, you add to that the food shortages, you add to that the energy shutdowns, what does it all do?
[00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:54.522]  It kills people.
[00:03:55.903 --> 00:03:58.925]  And the argument is, well we're doing this to save the earth, wink wink.
[00:04:01.843 --> 00:04:14.052]  But really it's killing the earth and changing its atmosphere and making it to where plants and animals and insects can't live and their populations are collapsing as well.
[00:04:14.072 --> 00:04:23.858]  And then you add the cherry on top, the accelerating artificial electromagnetic microwave radiation coming out of all the different systems like 5G.
[00:04:26.846 --> 00:04:30.908]  And we're just designed to be eased into this death, eased into this.
[00:04:31.348 --> 00:04:38.550]  And with all the available evidence, if you add it all up together, it points towards aliens.
[00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:43.672]  I mean, why would our own ruling class poison themselves, poison their children?
[00:04:43.712 --> 00:04:44.873]  Why would they do this to the whole earth?
[00:04:45.993 --> 00:04:55.629]   And that's the speculation part, is that there's been a deal made Not with off-world entities, but interdimensionals, to do this.
[00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:58.031]  And the globalists admit they're about to become gods, they believe.
[00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:05.016]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Thursday, June 2nd, 2022.
[00:05:05.457 --> 00:05:06.598]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:07.318 --> 00:05:08.279]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:05:08.299 --> 00:05:09.760]  We have several big guests coming up.
[00:05:10.341 --> 00:05:11.222]  We're going to have open phones.
[00:05:12.403 --> 00:05:14.845]  And I'm just going to be completely honest with you right now.
[00:05:15.385 --> 00:05:16.306]  I'm not giving up.
[00:05:16.406 --> 00:05:17.487]  I'm far from giving up.
[00:05:19.312 --> 00:05:34.504]  But I do have to really reassess everything we do here because we've been, thanks to the grace of God and your activism, the most successful outlet in the world at exposing that the globalists exist, and that they're predatory, and that they want to depopulate humans.
[00:05:35.782 --> 00:05:51.987]  But when you only expose that facet of it, that they're transhumanist, I believe they're about to transcend humanity, you don't expose what they're really doing that is killing the planet itself while they pose as the guardians and the protectors of it.
[00:05:53.487 --> 00:05:57.849]  And so we've known this for a long time, but we're gonna not cover it now.
[00:05:57.869 --> 00:06:01.790]  We're gonna cover it coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:14.145]  Where out of one side of their mouth they're telling you none of this EU engineering exists, but out of the other side of their mouth they're saying we're doing it for global warming and we're spraying pesticide in the air to stop COVID.
[00:06:15.086 --> 00:06:15.826]  Biocide.
[00:06:17.347 --> 00:06:24.650]  And I have the mainline UN documents, I have the mainline EU documents, and I have the Spanish government documents.
[00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:33.136]  Admitting, oh, we've increased the funding for this covert operation to spray pesticides on you to save you from COVID.
[00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:36.557]  That's just the cover for them poisoning everybody.
[00:06:36.977 --> 00:06:43.818]  The magnitude of this and how it's hidden in plain view absolutely boggles the mind.
[00:06:44.118 --> 00:06:52.980]  So we'll have NBC and ABC with graphics, oh, the planes fly over and they have chemicals out of the jet fuel and it creates a sunscreen to save you from global warming.
[00:06:55.805 --> 00:06:57.925]  And another story saying it doesn't exist, you're insane.
[00:06:58.966 --> 00:07:05.427]  The geoengineering facet is only one small part of this.
[00:07:07.087 --> 00:07:14.449]  It is a anticellular biocide, which means simply an anti-life pesticide.
[00:07:18.249 --> 00:07:21.650]  And out of one side of their mouth, they'll be like, oh, Bill Gates has a plan.
[00:07:23.191 --> 00:07:39.095]  The Department of Energy has a plan to spray the clouds to shield you from global warming, and then out of the other side, oh, the planes are causing global warming with their condensation trails, we need to tax them.
[00:07:39.755 --> 00:07:41.295]  So it's a total war on logic.
[00:07:41.475 --> 00:07:42.736]  All they do is confuse everybody.
[00:07:43.096 --> 00:07:53.570]   But in the Department of Energy documents, in the EU documents, in the UN World Climate Control Treaties of 1978 and 79, It's all there.
[00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:58.471]  I have the CIA director, seven years ago, Brennan, laying it all out.
[00:08:02.272 --> 00:08:03.412]  So that's coming up bottom of the hour.
[00:08:03.432 --> 00:08:07.033]  We're going to get it together and present that here for you.
[00:08:07.673 --> 00:08:12.894]  Because I saw a particular document, we went to the Spanish government, some scientists, it's real.
[00:08:13.474 --> 00:08:15.894]  We already knew this, but it's just the admission of the public.
[00:08:16.754 --> 00:08:23.773]   We're spraying anti-life chemicals, biocides, On you for your own good.
[00:08:24.714 --> 00:08:33.362]  The Spanish Meteorological Agency has confessed that Spain is being sprayed with lead dioxide, silver dioxide, and diatomite, and more.
[00:08:35.064 --> 00:08:40.008]  That is all coming up, ladies and gentlemen, bottom of the hour.
[00:08:40.188 --> 00:08:45.473]  And what's so frustrating is, people can pretend they're part of the power structure.
[00:08:47.455 --> 00:08:54.797]   People can Pretend that this isn't going on because it's so frightening?
[00:08:58.119 --> 00:08:59.859]  But it's still a reality.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.100]  It's still going on.
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:02.820]  It's still happening.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:18.857]   And when you add the geoengineering and the poison spring to the collapse of the animals and the insects and the biome, It is a biocide, which is a weapon that kills the biosphere.
[00:09:19.657 --> 00:09:43.815]   And if you looked at the Earth like an apple, the skin of an apple is around 50 times thicker in comparison to The atmosphere of the earth.
[00:09:44.295 --> 00:09:53.940]  The atmosphere is a tiny, thin, 15,000 foot gas that we live in.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:54.980]  It's our habitat.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.921]  It's where we exist.
[00:09:57.021 --> 00:10:12.189]  And it is under giant, unmitigated attack in a program a thousand times bigger conservatively than the Manhattan Project that gave us the atomic bomb.
[00:10:14.085 --> 00:10:18.067]  Fat man and little boy that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[00:10:19.007 --> 00:10:20.808]  That's 1940s technology.
[00:10:24.309 --> 00:10:32.553]  So you add everything together, we're being hit at every angle, non-stop.
[00:10:34.642 --> 00:10:39.667]  And I want to explain this very slowly again to everybody out there that is going along with the depopulation of humans.
[00:10:40.188 --> 00:10:42.210]  The entire Earth is being attacked.
[00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.433]  The entire life-giving system is under attack.
[00:10:45.813 --> 00:10:47.215]  The oceans are under attack.
[00:10:47.675 --> 00:11:05.284]   And again, the people running all this by design Tell you that the end of humanity, as we know it, is here, and that a new life form is about to rise, ladies and gentlemen, that is going to be silicon, and the atmosphere and everything is being designed for that new life form.
[00:11:06.805 --> 00:11:13.130]  Now you can ask yourself, why is Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Henry Kissinger and the New World Order doing this?
[00:11:15.489 --> 00:11:20.193]  Well, they tell you in their own literature, we don't believe in God, yet we're going to become gods.
[00:11:20.293 --> 00:11:21.334]  Ray Kurzweil, all of them.
[00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:24.837]  Now it's popularized what I told you about 20 years ago.
[00:11:24.897 --> 00:11:25.857]  People like Harari.
[00:11:26.778 --> 00:11:30.321]  Yuval Harari saying, you have no free will, we're taking him over, it's all over.
[00:11:31.522 --> 00:11:35.345]  Looking Forward to the End of Humanity, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, humans are bad.
[00:11:36.126 --> 00:11:38.287]  Now they're saying all carbon is bad.
[00:11:38.728 --> 00:11:41.230]  When they tell you carbon dioxide is bad, that's what plants breathe.
[00:11:42.654 --> 00:11:45.555]  This is a war on life, a war on carbon.
[00:11:47.195 --> 00:12:01.537]  And so the final piece of the puzzle, that I don't scientifically have the answers to, or psychologically, is why these people are doing something that would make their own planet unhabitable themselves, but I'm not stupid.
[00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:05.618]  And I can read all the ancient texts of ancient cultures and what they said.
[00:12:08.139 --> 00:12:26.356]   And I can see the religious works of Hollywood, where The makers of the Prometheus films admit this is really their religion, and this is what they believe that aliens from the star system Sirius created us, and that they've been given the order to kill us and wipe us all out.
[00:12:28.558 --> 00:12:37.666]  And so, you read the Bible about a fallen entity that is eternal, that is here trying to take over humanity, enslave us, then finally kill us.
[00:12:38.533 --> 00:12:52.527]  And the description that if you believe the God of the Israelites, what we were warned about, about a planetary government, a mark to buy and sell, total control over all life on Earth, massive depopulation, it's all happening.
[00:12:54.809 --> 00:13:06.183]   So whether you want to believe this or not, whether they really are working for aliens, Or whether it's some program put into us by what you'd call aliens that we carry this out.
[00:13:06.603 --> 00:13:12.827]  Or whether it's some delusional fiction that's self-fulfilling prophecy that's been picked up to be implemented.
[00:13:13.407 --> 00:13:17.170]  It doesn't matter because it's being done.
[00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.551]  The planet is being murdered.
[00:13:20.172 --> 00:13:21.673]  You are being murdered.
[00:13:22.974 --> 00:13:24.975]  And everything else is window dressing.
[00:13:26.576 --> 00:13:27.797]  Our IQs are dropping.
[00:13:28.177 --> 00:13:29.558]  The sperm counts have plunged.
[00:13:30.814 --> 00:13:31.975]  Cancer has exploded.
[00:13:32.835 --> 00:13:34.316]  Heart attacks have skyrocketed.
[00:13:36.657 --> 00:13:45.281]  And we have to decide what we're going to do as a species about this situation and understand.
[00:13:45.621 --> 00:13:47.202]  I've given you next year's news today.
[00:13:48.123 --> 00:13:50.404]  Well, I'm telling you now, this is here.
[00:13:50.484 --> 00:13:52.285]  You don't need to ask me to know that.
[00:13:52.525 --> 00:13:53.305]  You see it everywhere.
[00:13:54.326 --> 00:14:01.604]   And so anyone serving the system and playing along like you're on the winning team, Is a fool.
[00:14:02.865 --> 00:14:03.766]  This is nasty.
[00:14:04.606 --> 00:14:05.827]  This is as bad as it gets.
[00:14:06.607 --> 00:14:07.468]  And this is real.
[00:14:08.048 --> 00:14:18.675]  And we're smart enough to come together, have a group awakening to it, and remove the collaborators that are working with this off-world operation, Satan, from our planet.
[00:14:19.435 --> 00:14:21.516]  We have to defeat them before we go to the stars.
[00:14:21.536 --> 00:14:23.598]  They're not going to let us just get off the planet without a fight.
[00:14:24.403 --> 00:14:27.605]  We can, and we will, defeat this.
[00:14:28.366 --> 00:14:31.187]  But we must get full spectrum awareness before we can do it.
[00:14:31.868 --> 00:14:33.609]  Only the Holy Spirit can deliver that payload.
[00:14:34.149 --> 00:14:48.138]  Finally, the major Republican Senators, Tulsi Gabbards, Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, are talking about our enemy being world government and a private corporate crime syndicate launching their Great Reset and Build Back Better.
[00:14:48.459 --> 00:14:51.981]  Here's Tucker Carlson identifying the enemy last night.
[00:14:54.090 --> 00:15:03.433]  The truth is, any government that tries to make you more dependent, any government that tries to make you less self-sufficient, is by definition a malicious government.
[00:15:03.573 --> 00:15:04.553]  They are not on your side.
[00:15:04.813 --> 00:15:05.754]  They're trying to hurt you.
[00:15:06.814 --> 00:15:09.155]  Former NHL player Theo Fleury understands that.
[00:15:09.195 --> 00:15:09.995]  He's a Canadian.
[00:15:10.275 --> 00:15:11.735]  He played for many years in the NHL.
[00:15:11.755 --> 00:15:13.456]  If you're a hockey fan, you know exactly who he is.
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:14.940]  He's your hero.
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.803]  He's now the Director of Media for Canadians for Truth, Justice and Freedom.
[00:15:18.983 --> 00:15:19.784]  He joins us tonight.
[00:15:20.424 --> 00:15:21.985]  Theo, thanks so much for coming on.
[00:15:22.585 --> 00:15:33.112]  It's sad as... really, really sad for those of us... small number, but an avid number of Americans who really love Canada to see where your Prime Minister is taking the country.
[00:15:34.713 --> 00:15:35.954]  I mean, where's this going?
[00:15:37.695 --> 00:15:39.456]  Well, we all know where it's going, right?
[00:15:39.496 --> 00:15:51.748]   It's... you know, this ideology has It's been tried 24 times in the history of the planet and the only thing that comes out of it is death, you know?
[00:15:51.768 --> 00:15:52.048]  Yes.
[00:15:52.188 --> 00:16:06.262]  The communist, globalist agenda and what we're seeing right now is we're seeing the insane running the asylum and, you know, we're headed down a wrong road and a wrong path right now.
[00:16:07.529 --> 00:16:22.604]  To ban self-defense in the nation but legalize fentanyl, when fentanyl is killing multiples of the people that guns are killing in Canada, that doesn't wake Canadians up to the reality of this guy's maliciousness?
[00:16:24.586 --> 00:16:28.870]  Well, you would hope it would, but, you know, Tucker, I...
[00:16:30.103 --> 00:16:32.905]  I work in the field of trauma, mental health and addiction.
[00:16:32.945 --> 00:16:34.746]  I've been in this space for 15 years.
[00:16:34.766 --> 00:16:36.187]  Yes.
[00:16:36.307 --> 00:16:39.910]  The underlying theme is trauma, right?
[00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.592]  I believe that every single issue we have in society starts with trauma.
[00:16:44.293 --> 00:16:55.793]   And what we've seen over the last, you know, probably three years is systemic trauma and
[00:16:55.793 --> 00:16:59.173]  systemic abuse caused by the government.
[00:16:59.111 --> 00:17:02.392]  And what we're seeing is we saw a spike in mental health.
[00:17:02.452 --> 00:17:05.154]  We saw a spike in opioid use.
[00:17:05.234 --> 00:17:07.155]  We saw a spike in suicides.
[00:17:07.195 --> 00:17:11.137]  You know, seven and eight year old kids are having suicidal ideation.
[00:17:11.237 --> 00:17:15.759]  So this is pre-planned and premeditated.
[00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:23.563]  And you know, what Trudeau announced in the last couple of days is all part of the plan and where we're headed.
[00:17:24.275 --> 00:17:28.577]  And it's sick, and it's disgusting, and it needs to stop.
[00:17:29.437 --> 00:17:31.238]  That's the most interesting thing I've heard in a long time.
[00:17:31.918 --> 00:17:39.801]  Can you just be a little more specific and explain what you meant when you said the government has caused trauma on purpose for the last three years?
[00:17:40.714 --> 00:17:42.956]  Yeah, there's political trauma.
[00:17:43.457 --> 00:17:49.823]  They are causing as much chaos and trauma as they possibly can, right?
[00:17:50.183 --> 00:17:52.646]  We're seeing all these mass shootings now.
[00:17:54.348 --> 00:17:57.671]  You know, we're legalizing drugs.
[00:17:57.771 --> 00:17:58.392]  Think about that.
[00:17:58.952 --> 00:18:05.898]  Tucker, we're legalizing crystal meth as now a part of the Canadian healthcare system.
[00:18:06.178 --> 00:18:07.399]  That's basically what they said.
[00:18:07.779 --> 00:18:09.841]  That is complete insanity.
[00:18:09.941 --> 00:18:10.882]  It's insanity.
[00:18:11.442 --> 00:18:12.843]  And it needs to stop.
[00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:19.189]  This type of rhetoric, this type of leadership needs to go and it needs to go now.
[00:18:20.129 --> 00:18:22.191]  And people are shell-shocked after years of this.
[00:18:22.311 --> 00:18:24.933]  I'm going to be thinking about that for the next week.
[00:18:24.973 --> 00:18:28.176]  I think that's just such an amazing observation and so clearly true.
[00:18:29.449 --> 00:18:39.974]  Yeah, we're going to have people who have PTSD from the last three years because of what's going on.
[00:18:40.014 --> 00:18:42.055]  This is premeditated and preplanned.
[00:18:42.095 --> 00:18:54.120]  The World Economic Forum is in Canada and is running our country and running the Great Reset, whatever the hell you want to call it.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:58.181]  It is happening in Canada, and it is being played out.
[00:18:58.301 --> 00:19:04.122]  The script is being played out every single day in this country, and it's gotta stop.
[00:19:05.122 --> 00:19:05.863]  Amazing conversation.
[00:19:05.883 --> 00:19:06.863]  I'm really glad you came on tonight.
[00:19:06.883 --> 00:19:07.643]  I hope we'll see you again.
[00:19:07.783 --> 00:19:08.383]  Theo, thank you.
[00:19:09.203 --> 00:19:09.744]  Absolutely.
[00:19:09.804 --> 00:19:11.004]  Thank you so much, Tucker.
[00:19:11.444 --> 00:19:15.325]  All of it is a concerted operation to collapse civilization.
[00:19:16.425 --> 00:19:26.385]   And those collapsing civilization will pose as the saviors, And bring in their new technocracy on the ashes and bones of us.
[00:19:28.105 --> 00:19:35.128]  Everything they're doing is to create mass mental illness and to isolate us and destroy infrastructure.
[00:19:36.328 --> 00:19:37.108]  And we're in the middle of it.
[00:19:38.589 --> 00:19:47.632]  And my greatest frustration is that I know this is all going to happen.
[00:19:47.792 --> 00:19:48.432]  We're already in it.
[00:19:50.072 --> 00:19:56.538]  And I have been offered, obviously, to join these people many times over the years.
[00:19:56.598 --> 00:19:57.439]  I've even named names.
[00:20:01.743 --> 00:20:03.604]  And they just tell you, it's the way it is.
[00:20:03.704 --> 00:20:04.385]  It's going to happen.
[00:20:05.286 --> 00:20:06.207]  You should just surrender.
[00:20:06.227 --> 00:20:11.652]  I should just surrender and join them and pray on 90% of the public?
[00:20:12.472 --> 00:20:13.733]  Even if I was a sociopath?
[00:20:14.659 --> 00:20:15.240]  Which I'm not.
[00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:23.346]  I wouldn't be stupid enough to believe that this is a safe system for myself in the future, as if I wouldn't be betrayed by it.
[00:20:24.607 --> 00:20:25.788]  There's the live show feed.
[00:20:25.808 --> 00:20:42.583]  UNEU public documents confirm that a secret world government agency is spraying the planet's atmosphere with life-killing biocides as part of a terraforming project designed to kill all life on Earth.
[00:20:43.479 --> 00:20:44.979]  That last part is the most important.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:53.602]  Terraforming project designed to kill all life on earth.
[00:20:53.622 --> 00:20:55.083]  We'll go over the documents when we come back.
[00:20:55.143 --> 00:21:13.048]   But what's amazing is I have a stack of government reports and documents right now confirming that the so-called Pfizer and Moderna shots And AstraZeneca and J&J erase your immune system and don't
[00:21:13.048 --> 00:21:13.528]  protect you.
[00:21:13.528 --> 00:21:21.127]  And still they move forward the attack.
[00:21:21.355 --> 00:21:22.516]  With the poison injections.
[00:21:24.337 --> 00:21:25.818]  With the poison spray in the air.
[00:21:26.098 --> 00:21:27.419]  With the poison GMO food.
[00:21:27.659 --> 00:21:29.360]  With the fluoridated, toxified water.
[00:21:29.721 --> 00:21:33.063]  With the electromagnetic 5G and other G radiation everywhere.
[00:21:34.344 --> 00:21:36.025]  With the cultural, spiritual attack.
[00:21:37.452 --> 00:21:42.534]  With the annihilation of the family, the open borders, the cutting off the food, the giant wars that are being started.
[00:21:44.094 --> 00:21:44.694]  Starvation.
[00:21:46.295 --> 00:21:49.156]  And we sit there and see it happening.
[00:21:49.496 --> 00:21:53.057]  We see them rolling out State Department Memorandum 200.
[00:21:53.096 --> 00:22:02.216]  and 7277 public law.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:06.261]  And we watch the whole concerted attack go from beta to operational.
[00:22:08.086 --> 00:22:10.167]  And people ask me all the time, how do you take it?
[00:22:11.087 --> 00:22:12.187]  What's it like to be under attack?
[00:22:12.227 --> 00:22:13.588]  Well, I know I'm under attack.
[00:22:13.648 --> 00:22:14.408]  I'm fighting back.
[00:22:15.128 --> 00:22:21.250]  What's it like to not know you're under attack and to just stand down and let these people do this to you?
[00:22:22.971 --> 00:22:23.611]  It's incredible.
[00:22:25.191 --> 00:22:26.452]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[00:22:26.472 --> 00:22:28.953]  We'll look at their poisoning atmosphere straight ahead.
[00:22:28.973 --> 00:22:29.413]  Stay with us.
[00:22:30.693 --> 00:22:45.926]   So I'm about to show you corporate media Currently saying there's no covert geoengineering program, no chemtrails going on, and I'm going to show you more than 20 government documents and mainstream news headlines admitting they're doing it.
[00:22:47.046 --> 00:22:51.227]  And then when you read the fine print, oh, we're putting pesticides in the air.
[00:22:53.368 --> 00:23:08.105]   Not just aluminum dioxide that kills the ability for seeds to germinate and grow, or the killing of the Earth's ability to grow crops. You add that into all the other
[00:23:08.105 --> 00:23:09.785]  projects and all the other operations.
[00:23:09.785 --> 00:23:15.865]  It is beyond insane. It is the murder of the planet itself.
[00:23:15.865 --> 00:23:21.705]   But let me spend a few minutes on this. We've come a long way together and InfoWars is
[00:23:21.705 --> 00:23:27.865]   really the tip of the spear as we know. We've had a lot of small donors at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:23:27.991 --> 00:23:30.531]  There's a big button where you can donate or buy products right there at the top.
[00:23:31.172 --> 00:23:33.212]  We've had some big donors come in, the biggest ever.
[00:23:33.252 --> 00:23:38.394]  Very thankful to you because our finances were even worse than I thought a few months ago.
[00:23:39.354 --> 00:23:44.916]  It was being kept from me in a nice way that we were back two, three months on some of our biggest bills.
[00:23:44.936 --> 00:23:49.817]  Those are all paid up now thanks to the donations that have come in and folks stepping up.
[00:23:51.394 --> 00:23:54.917]  But you really should buy the products in Fuller Store because they really are high-end.
[00:23:54.937 --> 00:23:55.778]  They really are clean.
[00:23:56.138 --> 00:23:58.019]  They really are game-changing and amazing.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:04.204]  And now that we're in the black a little bit, I don't intend to sink back in the red.
[00:24:04.705 --> 00:24:05.926]  I'm fighting as hard as we can.
[00:24:05.946 --> 00:24:11.090]  You're going to get information here and full-spectrum analysis that you're not going to find anywhere else.
[00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:15.834]  So we've sold out of 77% of the coins as of this morning.
[00:24:17.115 --> 00:24:18.736]  That means there's 27% of the coins left, 2,000 and change.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:24.962]  Of course, this is not a silver investment.
[00:24:25.022 --> 00:24:27.705]  It's an investment in liberty and freedom in the future, in art.
[00:24:27.845 --> 00:24:29.586]  That's why there's a substantive markup.
[00:24:30.527 --> 00:24:32.049]  It is original art by yours truly.
[00:24:32.089 --> 00:24:38.635]  It's the third in the three-part Founders Series, exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[00:24:38.655 --> 00:24:41.658]  There's a big banner on the front page of mfulwarestore.com.
[00:24:42.139 --> 00:24:44.942]  It says, come and take it on the front with a Spartan helmet.
[00:24:45.694 --> 00:24:46.795]  From the Battle of Gallipoli, 300.
[00:24:47.495 --> 00:24:51.678]  On the back it says, Free Men Bear Arms.
[00:24:52.218 --> 00:24:54.860]  It is the last of the founding member coins to help keep us on air.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:25:00.804]  And obviously those that are members and bought the coin will be getting a lot of special benefits.
[00:25:00.824 --> 00:25:09.330]  I don't think that's why you bought the coin, but it'll definitely pay you back big time by getting the coin if we're able to continue on, which we'll do until our dying breath.
[00:25:10.754 --> 00:25:15.855]  So it really is the last chance you've got here in the next few days to get the coin.
[00:25:16.115 --> 00:25:19.596]  1776coin.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:25:21.116 --> 00:25:29.698]  Separately, the DVD came in yesterday and I've been so busy that I have not had time to cut an ad for it, but I'll just tell you about that.
[00:25:30.398 --> 00:25:37.820]  Everybody needs powerful films on their shelf as a DVD to have it in HD, to be able to get it out to people, be able to share it with people.
[00:25:38.660 --> 00:25:44.569]   We bought 20,000 of Dinesh D'Souza's new film.
[00:25:44.589 --> 00:25:47.731]  2,000 meals.
[00:25:49.551 --> 00:25:51.932]  And I said, Dinesh, I'd like 50% off on the film.
[00:25:52.893 --> 00:25:55.514]  And he said, no, Alex, we're going to do 60% off for you.
[00:25:56.935 --> 00:25:58.835]  And I hope to buy hundreds of thousands of the film.
[00:25:58.855 --> 00:26:03.457]  A lot of you have already seen it online, but it's very important to have the hard copy in your possession.
[00:26:04.918 --> 00:26:08.480]  And so the film is available at info or store.com.
[00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.791]  Ready to ship out to you.
[00:26:10.831 --> 00:26:12.672]  Now, we've also had this film in for two weeks.
[00:26:12.692 --> 00:26:14.334]  It's a five-part series.
[00:26:14.394 --> 00:26:15.574]  It's an incredible piece of history.
[00:26:16.115 --> 00:26:17.956]  But I've been so busy, I haven't cut in after that either.
[00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:21.179]  And that is COVIDLAND Part 3.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:32.367]  COVIDLAND Part 3 that really integrates all of what happened under the previous lockdowns, and the masks, and the lies, and what's coming next.
[00:26:32.847 --> 00:26:37.391]  You can get them discounted at 30% off when you get the two films together.
[00:26:38.866 --> 00:26:44.431]  At InfoWarsTore.com, or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:26:45.632 --> 00:26:59.984]  So, COVID land, the shot, episode three is available at InfoWarsTore.com, but get it 30% off together when you get it with 2,000 mules.
[00:27:00.725 --> 00:27:08.429]   We also have an even bigger special when you get all three COVID lands with 2,000 mules at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:27:08.529 --> 00:27:13.372]  And finally, we are running a Memorial Day special that will end this Sunday.
[00:27:14.192 --> 00:27:24.998]  Up to 60% off double Patriot points on incredible products like Alpha Power, Brain Force Ultra, Vitamin D3, Ultimate Fish Oil, Ultimate Creole Oil, Immune Support, Whole Food, Multivitamin, Dr. Jones Naturals, and more.
[00:27:25.158 --> 00:27:28.619]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:27:31.341 --> 00:27:33.102]  And please support our local affiliates while you're at it.
[00:27:33.122 --> 00:27:33.802]  That is so critical.
[00:27:34.745 --> 00:27:42.068]  All right, let me do this in the five minutes left to break, and then I'm going to come back and hit the... It's just devastating news.
[00:27:42.128 --> 00:27:58.936]  I mean, I knew this, and we covered it, we had it in other documents, but to have the European Union, the United Nations, and the Spanish government all release documents that, oh, we're spraying biocides.
[00:27:59.116 --> 00:28:00.597]  Biocide just means pesticide.
[00:28:02.138 --> 00:28:02.658]  It kills life.
[00:28:04.165 --> 00:28:06.126]  On you, it's being added to jet fuel.
[00:28:09.187 --> 00:28:15.670]  That alone, it almost does it injustice that I didn't come on air and just repeat that and cover the documents for four hours.
[00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:19.731]  I mean, you know, because it just becomes like background noise.
[00:28:19.751 --> 00:28:21.692]  Like, oh yeah, they're spraying it on us.
[00:28:22.853 --> 00:28:25.634]  While they'll simultaneously say it doesn't exist, but you add to that.
[00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:41.317]  The drag queen pedo time, the attacks on the family, the open borders, the evaluation of currencies, the shipping in of the toxic superpoisons, things like fentanyl, the GMO crops, the fluoride in the water, the poison injections.
[00:28:42.557 --> 00:28:51.480]  The horrible, toxic, anti-human, pedophilic culture of Hollywood, and just all of it, and these are people turned over to evil.
[00:28:52.421 --> 00:28:58.163]  All over the country, they're having classes now at gyms to teach your five-year-old how to have gay sex.
[00:28:58.243 --> 00:29:00.024]  I mean, it's pedophilia, folks.
[00:29:01.204 --> 00:29:04.425]  They go from gay marriage five years ago to, we want your children.
[00:29:05.386 --> 00:29:10.891]   And again, The media misrepresents it and says, well you're mad at somebody because of their sexual preference.
[00:29:11.271 --> 00:29:13.152]  I'm not attacking any adults for what they do.
[00:29:13.812 --> 00:29:14.713]  Leave the children alone.
[00:29:15.133 --> 00:29:25.438]  But the whole thing is a attack on the whole biological system and the nuclear family and how we operate and they admit that's the plan.
[00:29:25.798 --> 00:29:36.655]   So Justice Tucker Carlson, his great guest that I played a clip of last segment, explained This is designed trauma, designed pain to make you give up and make you commit suicide and make you die.
[00:29:37.015 --> 00:29:37.656]  It has a name.
[00:29:38.397 --> 00:29:41.220]  Trauma Based Mind Control.
[00:29:42.386 --> 00:29:43.527]  Trauma-based mind control.
[00:29:44.327 --> 00:29:45.148]  MKUltra.
[00:29:45.528 --> 00:29:51.612]  And they are externalizing what was done in laboratories in the last hundred years on the public now.
[00:29:51.672 --> 00:29:55.094]  And it's a very small, sick group of technocrats.
[00:29:55.154 --> 00:29:58.336]  My father was top of his class in Texas.
[00:29:58.736 --> 00:30:00.077]  Top six scores.
[00:30:00.738 --> 00:30:01.418]  Everybody tied.
[00:30:01.458 --> 00:30:02.039]  Perfect scores.
[00:30:02.972 --> 00:30:04.976]  Not just the regular test, a bunch of other ones.
[00:30:05.297 --> 00:30:07.502]  He thought he signed up when he was 14 to be part of NASA.
[00:30:07.983 --> 00:30:09.787]  He wasn't signing up with NASA ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:10.288 --> 00:30:11.049]  It was above the CIA.
[00:30:15.097 --> 00:30:27.320]  When he was 16 years old he was at UT playing to as a high school student going to UT and they said here's the secret nuclear reactors and here's our plan and we're gonna establish world government we're gonna do all this we're gonna carry all this out.
[00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:32.341]  My dad didn't tell me that until Endgame was about to come out in 2007.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:39.390]   They came by the office with my mom and they watched about an hour before he went to a ballet recital with my oldest
[00:30:39.390 --> 00:30:41.040]  daughter Charlotte, who's now 18.
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:49.280]   And we're driving to the recital and my mother, Carol, says to
[00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.919]   my dad, she said, David, because she knew he was involved in a lot of secret stuff.
[00:30:52.919 --> 00:30:55.559]  She goes, David, it's not that bad, is it?
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.601]  He said, no, it's as bad as he says and worse.
[00:30:57.982 --> 00:31:00.143]  And he just spilt his guts for 20 minutes in the car.
[00:31:01.864 --> 00:31:03.966]  And I knew he was involved in all that and got out of it.
[00:31:05.948 --> 00:31:09.951]  But the point is, is that he knew all this stuff in the 1960s.
[00:31:12.096 --> 00:31:20.679]  They had computers that were secret, and he was even in the most secretive areas, in the 60s that weren't out until the 80s.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.181]  CD-ROMs, everything.
[00:31:26.301 --> 00:31:30.863]  And it's still not on record there's a nuclear reactor under UT.
[00:31:31.663 --> 00:31:41.167]  I mean, I found government documents confirming what my dad told me, but imagine, they've let all the best minds into this, and the rest of us, it's been decided we're all dead.
[00:31:42.773 --> 00:31:43.153]  Well, you know what?
[00:31:43.173 --> 00:31:43.714]  We're not dead.
[00:31:44.495 --> 00:31:52.423]  And we are back, exposing the secret plan for world government and a new form of life upon Earth, all their life to be exterminated.
[00:31:53.484 --> 00:32:02.814]  Here is the man who was the CIA director at the time, seven years ago, John Brennan, admitting the giant geoengineering chemtrail program.
[00:32:04.744 --> 00:32:13.890]  Another example is the array of technologies, often referred to collectively as geoengineering, that potentially could help reverse the warming effects of global climate change.
[00:32:14.931 --> 00:32:28.260]  One that has gained my personal attention is stratospheric aerosol injection, or SAI, a method of seeding the stratosphere with particles that can help reflect the sun's heat in much the same way that volcanic eruptions do.
[00:32:29.508 --> 00:32:39.976]  An SAI program could limit global temperature increases, reducing some risks associated with higher temperatures and providing the world economy additional time to transition from fossil fuels.
[00:32:41.057 --> 00:32:43.058]  This process is also relatively inexpensive.
[00:32:43.659 --> 00:32:50.304]  The National Research Council estimates that a fully deployed SAI program would cost about $10 billion yearly.
[00:32:51.485 --> 00:32:58.050]  As promising as it may be, moving forward on SAI would also raise a number of challenges for our government and for the international community.
[00:32:59.011 --> 00:33:12.400]  On the technical side, greenhouse gas emission reductions would still have to accompany SAI to address other climate change effects, such as ocean acidification, because SAI alone would not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
[00:33:13.561 --> 00:33:25.809]  On the geopolitical side, the technology's potential to alter weather patterns and benefit certain regions of the world at the expense of other regions could trigger sharp opposition by some nations.
[00:33:26.468 --> 00:33:29.090]  That's right, changing your weather changes somebody else's weather.
[00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:31.471]  So, we have that backdrop here.
[00:33:31.491 --> 00:33:34.253]  And we have this London Guardian article.
[00:33:35.454 --> 00:33:38.656]  My month with Kim Trill conspiracy theorist.
[00:33:40.257 --> 00:33:42.458]  Tammy Reed and her partner are insane.
[00:33:42.958 --> 00:33:47.301]  They believe there's a secret project when all it is is ice crystals from condensation.
[00:33:47.361 --> 00:33:48.662]  Now those fade away in a few minutes.
[00:33:49.929 --> 00:33:51.910]  And then we get all of this.
[00:33:52.471 --> 00:33:56.753]  Bill Gates' venture aims to spray dust into the atmosphere to block the sun.
[00:33:56.853 --> 00:33:57.714]  What could go wrong?
[00:33:57.854 --> 00:33:58.254]  Forbes.
[00:34:01.436 --> 00:34:04.118]  Controversial spraying method aims to curb global warming.
[00:34:04.598 --> 00:34:05.539]  CBS News.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:12.423]  Geoengineering marks scientific gangs in UN report on dire climate future.
[00:34:12.443 --> 00:34:13.804]  They've got to do it for our own good.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.902]  London Guardian, what if it's too late to save our planet without geoengineering?
[00:34:18.282 --> 00:34:24.745]  So the Guardian says it doesn't exist, you're bad out of one article, and then says it exists and it's good out of another.
[00:34:26.907 --> 00:34:30.829]  Science.org, geoengineers inch closer to sun-dimming balloon test.
[00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:36.592]  Geoengineering, the quick and potentially catastrophic fix for climate change.
[00:34:36.952 --> 00:34:38.233]  ABC News, Australia.
[00:34:39.413 --> 00:34:41.294]  Here's what scientists really think about chemtrails.
[00:34:42.075 --> 00:34:43.776]  Huffington Post, they're real, they're good for you.
[00:34:45.799 --> 00:34:46.959]  And then NBC News.
[00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:49.780]  Do airplane contrails add to climate change?
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.520]  Yes, and the problem is about to get worse.
[00:34:53.761 --> 00:34:58.462]  I mentioned this CIA director on the geopolitical risk of climate geoengineering, which is ongoing.
[00:35:00.863 --> 00:35:04.204]  And the stacks go on and on and on.
[00:35:04.244 --> 00:35:06.404]  But what's the new information?
[00:35:10.045 --> 00:35:10.825]  We already knew this.
[00:35:10.845 --> 00:35:13.886]  We had guests on years ago that did the test.
[00:35:17.523 --> 00:35:22.427]  And we've got samples of soil all over the world, but particularly the U.S.
[00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:26.070]  From Oregon to New York, from Florida to Texas.
[00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:40.724]  And they found very toxic, extremely poisonous pesticides that kill everything, plant, animal, amphibian, fish, insect it comes in contact with.
[00:35:41.164 --> 00:35:43.465]  And you wonder why they admit mainstream news.
[00:35:43.945 --> 00:35:47.127]  Where are all the insects or the windshield test?
[00:35:48.108 --> 00:35:53.671]  I drove just a few months ago in the spring in Texas to our historic family land in East Texas.
[00:35:56.744 --> 00:35:58.545]  In our hands since the late 1820s.
[00:36:00.646 --> 00:36:08.651]  And normally when I travel, in the spring particularly, I have to stop three times with a squeegee at gas stations and clean the dead bugs off.
[00:36:08.952 --> 00:36:11.113]  And the radiator is just covered with dead bugs.
[00:36:12.653 --> 00:36:13.653]  No bugs.
[00:36:13.653 --> 00:36:16.393]  No bugs.
[00:36:16.393 --> 00:36:19.492]  No bugs.
[00:36:19.492 --> 00:36:25.172]  If the bugs are dying, what's that mean?
[00:36:25.202 --> 00:36:32.529]  See, they're not just killing the evil humans we've all been taught to hate, how bad we are, how guilty we are, turning our life force against ourselves.
[00:36:34.951 --> 00:36:37.854]  They are killing the whole planet.
[00:36:40.977 --> 00:37:00.209]   So here's national Spanish news, Vaz de Mitrilla, The Spanish Meteorological Agency has confessed that Spain is being sprayed with lead dioxide, silver, iodine, and diatomite, and more.
[00:37:00.269 --> 00:37:09.893]  And it goes on to say that they are spraying, with UN authorization and the EU, biocides.
[00:37:13.175 --> 00:37:14.135]  Biocides.
[00:37:14.775 --> 00:37:15.836]  And look up biocides.
[00:37:16.656 --> 00:37:18.377]  A pesticide that kills life.
[00:37:20.356 --> 00:37:30.703]  And they say in the press release, that's right here in Spanish, that it's being done to stop global warming.
[00:37:30.863 --> 00:37:32.984]  So pesticides stop global warming.
[00:37:33.485 --> 00:37:34.765]  Oh, but wait, it gets better.
[00:37:38.468 --> 00:37:39.228]  It gets a lot better.
[00:37:43.711 --> 00:37:52.572]   They go on to say that it's also To stop COVID.
[00:37:55.553 --> 00:37:56.933]  And there's another little problem here.
[00:37:59.053 --> 00:38:01.854]  They talk in documents about stopping COVID in 2019.
[00:38:02.114 --> 00:38:09.015]  That's their cover for the whole thing.
[00:38:09.836 --> 00:38:10.876]  I suggest you go read it.
[00:38:11.456 --> 00:38:12.096]  Here's Reuters.
[00:38:12.676 --> 00:38:16.597]  Geoengineering marks scientific gain in UN report on dire climate future.
[00:38:17.984 --> 00:38:19.025]  Only this can save us.
[00:38:19.365 --> 00:38:22.087]  But don't debate it while it's been going on for decades, secretly.
[00:38:22.708 --> 00:38:25.229]  Controversial spraying method aims to curb global warming.
[00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:26.010]  CBS News.
[00:38:28.452 --> 00:38:34.236]  And then we have House Republicans introduce climate change strategy with eye on midterms.
[00:38:34.656 --> 00:38:40.040]  Oh, they admit it's real, but they've got a better way to cut the evil carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:38:40.801 --> 00:38:47.205]   It is a declaration Of war against the building blocks of all life on this planet.
[00:38:47.865 --> 00:38:48.825]  Carbon-based life forms.
[00:38:49.305 --> 00:38:56.347]  And the carbon cycle of sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen.
[00:38:57.027 --> 00:39:01.388]  And you take out carbon dioxide, and you collapse the planet.
[00:39:02.268 --> 00:39:03.788]  I can pull up headlines, CNN.
[00:39:04.509 --> 00:39:09.090]  Scientists call for cutting down trees to stop carbon, because they put out carbon dioxide.
[00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:19.130]   those damn trees and now if you're a new listener part of the establishment or
[00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:21.430]   want to be part of the establishment you pretend you're part of the
[00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:28.769]   establishment do you really think you're safe going along with this power structure?
[00:39:26.946 --> 00:39:29.768]  Do you really think you're part of the winning team?
[00:39:29.788 --> 00:39:46.812]   Because it's not just this, it's the human-animal hybrids, it's all the new viruses they're creating, it's everything these mad scientists are doing, playing God, and they believe That they have to collapse, not just civilization and not just humans, but everything else.
[00:39:46.892 --> 00:39:53.697]  And out of this great evolutionary struggle, you're getting the big secret of their transhumanist cult right now.
[00:39:53.797 --> 00:39:54.897]  Most important thing in the world.
[00:39:54.938 --> 00:39:55.458]  Do you care?
[00:39:55.478 --> 00:39:58.860]  Like, you know, we're not just next year's news today.
[00:39:59.561 --> 00:40:01.322]  You're getting everything here.
[00:40:02.703 --> 00:40:03.664]  God believes in you.
[00:40:03.904 --> 00:40:04.585]  I believe in you.
[00:40:04.605 --> 00:40:05.345]  Believe in yourself.
[00:40:06.406 --> 00:40:07.086]  Research this.
[00:40:07.207 --> 00:40:07.507]  Know it.
[00:40:08.925 --> 00:40:12.514]  And then take control of our governments legally and lawfully and stop this.
[00:40:14.178 --> 00:40:16.804]  They don't want us debating it when they start the project 30 years ago.
[00:40:18.206 --> 00:40:23.187]  They say it doesn't exist, while they start announcing it exists, till they just normalize it, and so what?
[00:40:23.267 --> 00:40:24.808]  Yeah, they're spraying something.
[00:40:25.148 --> 00:40:26.228]  Yeah, I got cancer.
[00:40:26.468 --> 00:40:27.729]  Yeah, my sperm count's gone.
[00:40:28.009 --> 00:40:29.109]  Yeah, I can't have babies.
[00:40:29.429 --> 00:40:30.529]  Yeah, I got Parkinson's.
[00:40:30.849 --> 00:40:32.330]  Yeah, the diseases are all exploding.
[00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:33.670]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:37.431]  Last year, FDA says, no comment needed to the public.
[00:40:38.011 --> 00:40:39.072]  No research done.
[00:40:39.412 --> 00:40:42.152]  It's not in our regulatory capacity.
[00:40:42.452 --> 00:40:44.513]  We're just busy shutting down baby formula plants.
[00:40:46.024 --> 00:40:54.930]  To even look at what unlimited nanotech is being sprayed in the food and water, and they just said, yeah, you can do it.
[00:40:57.231 --> 00:40:58.352]  They're hitting us in the sky.
[00:40:58.672 --> 00:40:59.613]  They're hitting us in the food.
[00:40:59.893 --> 00:41:00.854]  They're hitting us in the soil.
[00:41:01.074 --> 00:41:01.994]  They're hitting us in the water.
[00:41:02.014 --> 00:41:03.475]  They're hitting us psychologically.
[00:41:03.655 --> 00:41:04.836]  They're hitting us with 5G.
[00:41:05.056 --> 00:41:06.077]  They're hitting us spiritually.
[00:41:06.417 --> 00:41:08.458]  They're hitting us with the cultural propaganda.
[00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:11.741]  They're hitting us, hitting us, hitting us, hitting us, hitting us.
[00:41:12.001 --> 00:41:18.784]   But instead of being victims and going, I'm a victim, I'm depressed, oh, it's all over, You have to say, I am eternal spirit in this body.
[00:41:19.064 --> 00:41:23.085]  There is a God that created the universe that is infinitely bigger than my enemies.
[00:41:23.405 --> 00:41:28.627]  And I want God to come into me and energize me to oppose this and resist this and give me the discernment.
[00:41:28.867 --> 00:41:33.848]  That means the intelligence to say no to this and overcome it.
[00:41:34.008 --> 00:41:37.529]  And God will answer you.
[00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:44.731]  But you have to believe in God and stretch your arms out like the rune of life.
[00:41:46.084 --> 00:41:47.445]  Peace is the dead tree.
[00:41:47.565 --> 00:41:47.805]  Death.
[00:41:48.366 --> 00:41:49.787]  Love how they call peace the death rune.
[00:41:50.307 --> 00:41:51.108]  The rune of life.
[00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:51.809]  Life.
[00:41:52.369 --> 00:41:52.990]  I want life.
[00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:54.411]  Give me life, God.
[00:41:54.711 --> 00:41:55.111]  Help me.
[00:41:55.232 --> 00:41:55.752]  Energize me.
[00:41:55.852 --> 00:41:56.653]  I can't do this alone.
[00:41:56.953 --> 00:41:57.553]  I need your help.
[00:41:57.774 --> 00:41:58.314]  You made me.
[00:41:58.434 --> 00:41:59.035]  I'm your son.
[00:41:59.135 --> 00:41:59.715]  I'm your daughter.
[00:41:59.955 --> 00:42:00.496]  Help me!
[00:42:02.898 --> 00:42:03.458]  I'm ready!
[00:42:03.478 --> 00:42:09.523]  And then if you have the courage, God will enter you and empower you.
[00:42:09.884 --> 00:42:11.205]  Hour number two, straight ahead.
[00:42:11.225 --> 00:42:12.566]  InfoWars.com.
[00:42:12.606 --> 00:42:14.606]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:42:14.606 --> 00:42:28.606]  [Music]
[00:42:28.606 --> 00:42:33.606]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:40.401]  So things are going so poorly for the White House that even NBC News can no longer ignore it.
[00:42:40.541 --> 00:42:41.521]  Vote for Biden!
[00:42:41.962 --> 00:42:42.802]  He's an adult!
[00:42:43.582 --> 00:42:44.202]  Not anymore.
[00:42:44.702 --> 00:42:48.983]  Here's the line from NBC, quote, Biden is rattled by his sinking approval ratings.
[00:42:49.623 --> 00:42:53.244]  There are signs of managerial breakdowns at the White House.
[00:42:53.324 --> 00:42:58.085]  NBC also reports that Biden is furious that his aides keep walking back his demented comments.
[00:42:58.165 --> 00:43:01.705]  Quote, Biden was furious his remarks were being seen as unreliable.
[00:43:02.906 --> 00:43:03.706]  I wonder why!
[00:43:04.434 --> 00:43:07.856]  As he repeatedly declares war on various countries, and that's just the beginning.
[00:43:08.577 --> 00:43:19.504]  Politico, and no publication has sucked up to Biden harder than Politico, but Politico is reporting that the Biden White House is awash in malignant white supremacy.
[00:43:19.625 --> 00:43:20.325]  Are you surprised?
[00:43:20.365 --> 00:43:21.146]  Not really, of course.
[00:43:21.446 --> 00:43:28.130]  Quote, at least 21 black staffers have left the Biden White House since late last year or are planning to leave soon.
[00:43:29.211 --> 00:43:31.473]  Sources blame the quote, work environment.
[00:43:31.493 --> 00:43:34.896]  In other words, the racism of the Biden administration.
[00:43:35.637 --> 00:43:40.561]  So things have gotten very bad for Joe Biden, both public facing and internally.
[00:43:41.141 --> 00:43:42.022]  What are they doing about it?
[00:43:42.062 --> 00:43:48.908]  Well, they broke glass in case of emergency and invited a Korean pop group to speak at the White House today.
[00:43:49.268 --> 00:43:49.489]  Watch.
[00:43:50.345 --> 00:43:59.581]  Hi, we're BTS, and it is a great honor to be invited to the White House today to discuss the important issues of anti-Asian hate crimes, Asian inclusion, and diversity.
[00:44:01.403 --> 00:44:08.846]  Yeah, so we got a Korean pop group to discuss anti-Asian hate crimes in the United States.
[00:44:09.446 --> 00:44:10.967]  Okay, good job guys.
[00:44:11.187 --> 00:44:21.090]  As Noah Pollack points out, quote, the Biden administration is defending anti-Asian racial discrimination in university admissions in a case before the Supreme Court in case you wanted to compare substance versus PR.
[00:44:21.951 --> 00:44:23.231]  It's not even very good PR.
[00:44:23.411 --> 00:44:26.032]  This is not even the first time the Biden administration has done something like this.
[00:44:26.412 --> 00:44:30.594]  Last August, they invited a TikTok star to the White House because that'll make things better.
[00:44:31.823 --> 00:44:36.144]  Hi, my name is Cooper, and this is a day in my life as a White House intern.
[00:44:38.505 --> 00:44:39.305]  We did it, Joe.
[00:44:40.026 --> 00:44:40.806]  Hey, everyone.
[00:44:40.846 --> 00:44:42.527]  Hey, Jenny.
[00:44:42.547 --> 00:44:44.107]  I booked you a nail appointment, love.
[00:44:44.287 --> 00:44:45.407]  Yeah, I didn't tell you to do that.
[00:44:45.488 --> 00:44:46.328]  It's called initiative.
[00:44:46.468 --> 00:44:47.848]  Hi, White House.
[00:44:47.868 --> 00:44:48.408]  This is Cooper.
[00:44:49.129 --> 00:44:49.649]  I don't think so.
[00:44:51.648 --> 00:44:55.669]  Yep, they hate the country, trying to degrade it, and it's working.
[00:44:56.009 --> 00:45:05.432]  But the headline here is that the white supremacy in the Biden White House is so intense, 21 black staffers, can there be more than 21 total?
[00:45:06.153 --> 00:45:08.513]  Not a huge staff at the White House.
[00:45:08.533 --> 00:45:10.034]  21 black staffers have fled.
[00:45:10.942 --> 00:45:14.605]  Speaking of the new Jim Crow, Candace Owens is the founder of the charity Blexit.
[00:45:14.685 --> 00:45:15.946]  She's probably not surprised by this.
[00:45:15.966 --> 00:45:16.687]  She joins us tonight.
[00:45:17.027 --> 00:45:24.674]  Candace, are you surprised that the racism, the white supremacy at the White House is so intense that black staffers are fleeing for their lives?
[00:45:26.735 --> 00:45:30.820]  I have to say I'm a little bit upset that I'm not involved in these strategy sessions at the White House.
[00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:36.328]  I just picture them all sitting around a table and just, quick, quick, black people are waking up and they're not happy.
[00:45:36.588 --> 00:45:38.831]  Grab me an Asian and put him in front of the podium.
[00:45:38.851 --> 00:45:41.715]  We've got to shift here and shift gears completely on the PR show.
[00:45:41.515 --> 00:45:44.475]   strategy. I mean this is this is actually what they're doing right because black
[00:45:44.475 --> 00:45:47.475]   Americans first and foremost what's happening parallel to this is black
[00:45:47.475 --> 00:45:51.354]   Americans are waking up to the lie that was Black Lives Matter. So at the same
[00:45:51.354 --> 00:45:54.395]   time you're having these black Americans that were quite literally just given
[00:45:54.395 --> 00:45:57.515]   these positions they weren't meant to do anything. They never wanted them to
[00:45:57.515 --> 00:46:00.475]   actually do anything. They probably were underqualified for the positions that
[00:46:00.475 --> 00:46:04.675]   they even had but the idea was oh look we're getting on our knees literally if
[00:46:04.675 --> 00:46:07.714]   you're Nancy Pelosi to the Black Lives Matter narrative right remember she did
[00:46:07.714 --> 00:46:11.714]   that that notorious bow and got down on one knee and we're gonna do this and
[00:46:11.714 --> 00:46:14.355]   show you that we're gonna hire a bunch of black people but we don't actually
[00:46:14.355 --> 00:46:18.874]   care what they think we just need them to be sit there and be black. Now the
[00:46:18.874 --> 00:46:21.395]   black Americans in the White House are waking up and going you know what that's
[00:46:21.395 --> 00:46:25.755]   not okay with me and they're frantically searching to find up drum up a new
[00:46:25.755 --> 00:46:40.634]   narrative of hate and this one's gonna be Asian-American, Asian lives matter, quick grab me K-pop, and hopefully America's going to fall for this, when in reality we're focused on the gas prices, the inflation prices, and it's just an absolute complete joke.
[00:46:41.275 --> 00:46:43.978]  Is there anything more destructive than white liberal guilt?
[00:46:43.998 --> 00:46:46.241]  It feels like it's hurt more people than nuclear weapons.
[00:46:48.247 --> 00:46:50.148]  It really has, and people are starting to see that.
[00:46:50.228 --> 00:47:01.776]  Even Patrisse Cullors, right, the person who started Black Lives Matter, basically said, well it's not my fault that you guys gave me your white guilty dollars and I lied about what I did with it and bought myself an entire real estate empire, and that's the truth.
[00:47:01.816 --> 00:47:05.358]  So it's not just black Americans that need to have an awakening, it's white Americans.
[00:47:05.618 --> 00:47:12.182]  You know, you have to stop allowing people to manipulate you emotionally and tell you that you're a bad person just because you're born a certain color.
[00:47:12.742 --> 00:47:23.919]   So we just did almost all the first hour on The EU, the UN, the Spanish government releasing documents going, hey, we're spraying pesticides in the jet fuel on you and your family.
[00:47:24.219 --> 00:47:25.079]  It's to stop COVID.
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:26.200]  What?
[00:47:28.481 --> 00:47:30.981]  It attacks and kills basically all life it comes in contact with.
[00:47:31.041 --> 00:47:33.022]  It builds up in your body and kills you slowly.
[00:47:34.002 --> 00:47:35.263]  What an incredible first hour.
[00:47:35.283 --> 00:47:35.923]  Have you just tuned in?
[00:47:36.943 --> 00:47:38.685]  We'll archive it later to Band.Video.
[00:47:39.225 --> 00:47:43.549]  And your life, quite frankly, depends on you getting that information and getting it out.
[00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:50.135]  You know, we have lots of meat and potatoes stories here that will be really interesting and really informative at one level.
[00:47:50.736 --> 00:47:56.061]  Oh, Hunter Biden was searching for kiddie porn online.
[00:47:56.301 --> 00:47:57.642]  That's coming out now in the documents.
[00:47:58.723 --> 00:48:01.426]  And he's on the videos and the photos having sex with his niece.
[00:48:04.538 --> 00:48:06.620]  Oh, in the documents he's sending his dad stuff.
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.161]  We already know that.
[00:48:08.281 --> 00:48:12.283]  Biden was put in as a puppet to take the blame for the Great Reset.
[00:48:12.804 --> 00:48:13.644]  And I hate Biden.
[00:48:13.784 --> 00:48:14.865]  And I hope he gets impeached.
[00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.066]  And I want him to be removed.
[00:48:16.106 --> 00:48:20.229]  But we need to say, get rid of your puppet, not, oh, Biden did all this.
[00:48:20.609 --> 00:48:22.570]  Now we have Democrat politicians blaming Biden.
[00:48:22.850 --> 00:48:24.331]  We have the Federal Reserve blaming Biden.
[00:48:24.592 --> 00:48:25.912]  We have, I told you this was coming.
[00:48:25.972 --> 00:48:26.493]  It's Biden.
[00:48:27.694 --> 00:48:31.016]  They put him in there because he was dumb enough to take the fall for all this.
[00:48:31.596 --> 00:48:34.138]  Not dumb enough, senile enough.
[00:48:34.478 --> 00:48:42.478]   But where the rubber really meets the road, because it's more academic being sprayed with
[00:48:42.478 --> 00:48:48.798]   chemicals or being given a poison shot, but when you can't go to the grocery store and
[00:48:48.798 --> 00:48:53.197]   you can't get baby formula, and we learned that when Biden got in a year ago, they started
[00:48:53.197 --> 00:48:54.878]  shutting down baby formula manufacturers.
[00:48:55.129 --> 00:48:56.190]  And you ask, why are they doing it?
[00:48:56.230 --> 00:49:01.717]  Why have now over 70 food processing plants in the last 60, 70 days burned down?
[00:49:02.458 --> 00:49:06.082]  And you look at all the other policies that shut us down, all the other policies destroy us.
[00:49:07.584 --> 00:49:10.067]  They're destroying the industrial society.
[00:49:12.179 --> 00:49:18.282]  The Extinction Rebellion, you see all over the news, blocking highways and factories and bus stations and train stations.
[00:49:18.623 --> 00:49:20.884]  That's just their public PR arm.
[00:49:22.565 --> 00:49:26.007]  That's their grassroots astroturf that they pay for.
[00:49:28.928 --> 00:49:32.350]  So we've got some clips here, then we'll get into the economy in general and the hyperinflation.
[00:49:33.751 --> 00:49:38.054]  JP Morgan's CEO says a hurricane's coming for the US economy.
[00:49:38.074 --> 00:49:38.614]  Brace yourself.
[00:49:39.114 --> 00:49:45.696]   That's like a fox Abby's already gone and eaten half the chickens one night, saying, hey, you know what?
[00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:47.176]  The rest of the chickens are about to get eaten.
[00:49:48.717 --> 00:49:59.119]  But here is the new White House press secretary, talking about a political suicide mission, talking about the baby formula.
[00:50:00.439 --> 00:50:04.740]  She says, we did everything we could from the moment that we learned of the recall.
[00:50:06.901 --> 00:50:07.781]  The recall they ordered.
[00:50:09.741 --> 00:50:10.481]  But it's bigger than that.
[00:50:10.541 --> 00:50:11.521]  It's the societal breakdown.
[00:50:11.561 --> 00:50:12.382]  It's not just one company.
[00:50:12.402 --> 00:50:12.982]  It's not just three.
[00:50:13.282 --> 00:50:13.782]  It's dozens.
[00:50:15.122 --> 00:50:17.823]  And then they say, but someone called the White House.
[00:50:20.024 --> 00:50:26.445]  And she can't get her story straight with Biden, who says, yeah, we were called last year, but I wasn't told, says Biden.
[00:50:27.025 --> 00:50:29.146]  So let's just play clip one through three back to back.
[00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:40.574]  We did everything that we can from the moment that we learned about the recall to work 24-7 to make sure that the production went up.
[00:50:40.994 --> 00:50:49.077]  I guess that just doesn't address the question of why it was that the president didn't know when the manufacturers are saying that they knew.
[00:50:49.437 --> 00:50:55.319]  As soon as the recalls happened, as soon as the plant was shut down, that this would be a very serious problem.
[00:50:55.939 --> 00:50:58.060]  Was there a breakdown in the process here?
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:00.940]  Did somebody fail to inform him?
[00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:02.579]  Look I have not spoken to the president.
[00:51:02.579 --> 00:51:06.059]  I know that he just said that a few moments ago.
[00:51:06.059 --> 00:51:11.079]   So I would have to I would have to talk to him about about the April date.
[00:51:11.079 --> 00:51:16.400]   But what I can tell you is what he has seen and this I know for certain is that seeing
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.739]  the empty shelves is unacceptable.
[00:51:18.728 --> 00:51:21.410]  Seeing what families are going through is unacceptable.
[00:51:21.730 --> 00:51:30.415]  This is why we have been working 24-7 to make sure that we are using every lever at our disposal to deliver for the American people.
[00:51:30.595 --> 00:51:41.762]  That is what I know for sure that I can share with you at this moment, and that's how we're going to continue to move to make sure that we're doing everything that we can and beyond.
[00:51:42.142 --> 00:51:48.207]  So you did, February 17th was a recall, February 18th the FDA issued instructions to states.
[00:51:49.789 --> 00:51:52.151]  Let's, let's, can we continue that through April?
[00:51:52.812 --> 00:51:59.918]  When did somebody call the White House to say, this is a problem, you guys may need to get involved?
[00:52:00.679 --> 00:52:08.119]   So I could say that, um, again, the recall happened on the day, day one of the recall, we took action as a Okay.
[00:52:08.139 --> 00:52:08.620]  He understands.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:14.358]   approach right with FDA, USDA as I just laid out and the president understands
[00:52:14.358 --> 00:52:20.199]   again he understands how difficult this is he understands how challenging this
[00:52:20.199 --> 00:52:24.000]   is and we have acknowledged that he understands that this is the job of the
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:29.880]   president to be able to multitask to get things done. Okay he understands he
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:34.039]   understands he's carrying out the great reset the transition cutting off the
[00:52:34.039 --> 00:52:40.519]   power cutting off the oil cutting off the pipelines he understands now
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:41.944]  Though we have a compilation of them denying this six months ago.
[00:52:42.966 --> 00:52:49.356]  We have a compilation of them saying inflation didn't exist, that inflation was good, and well now inflation is somebody else's fault.
[00:52:49.376 --> 00:52:49.937]  Let's continue.
[00:52:52.932 --> 00:52:57.254]  When it comes to making sure that your child gets healthy, healthy food.
[00:52:58.234 --> 00:53:00.455]  And so that is what we've been doing.
[00:53:00.515 --> 00:53:05.738]  When was someone called here at the White House to say this could be an issue that requires presidential involvement?
[00:53:05.818 --> 00:53:07.539]  So I don't have the timeline on that.
[00:53:07.859 --> 00:53:13.481]  All I can tell you as a whole of government approach, we have been working on this since the recall in February.
[00:53:13.501 --> 00:53:18.791]   independent regulatory agency, the FDA, the one that questions have been referred to in the past is now being
[00:53:18.791 --> 00:53:20.501]  embraced as whole government.
[00:53:20.501 --> 00:53:24.501]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:53:24.501 --> 00:53:28.501]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:53:28.501 --> 00:53:32.501]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:53:32.501 --> 00:53:36.501]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:53:36.501 --> 00:53:40.501]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:53:40.501 --> 00:53:46.501]   I was actually sent to the county assistance before any of us were sent to the county school security.
[00:53:46.501 --> 00:53:51.501]  And so I wanted to stay there and get an extended leave.
[00:53:51.501 --> 00:53:58.220]   I had to walk all the way over to the committee in India and I think that I left an incredible amount of work in
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:00.501]  India for the community service.
[00:54:00.501 --> 00:54:10.501]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:54:22.501 --> 00:54:32.501]  [INAUDIBLE]
[00:54:32.501 --> 00:54:48.501]  So again, why is this so important?
[00:54:49.281 --> 00:55:05.509]  Because it's part of their operation, it's part of what they're doing, training you not to have food, training you not to have water, training you not to have electricity, training you you can't have a car, training you you can't have air conditioning, training you you don't have a job, training you that you're not essential, and then they sit there and act like they don't know why it's happening.
[00:55:05.909 --> 00:55:17.295]  Imagine being the idiots that sign on in the Biden administration, actually believing they're part of a winning team, when they're the fall guys and the scapegoats for what the New World Order is doing.
[00:55:17.955 --> 00:55:26.097]  Thank God Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and all these senators get it down are saying it's the UN, it's the WEF, it's the big corporations.
[00:55:26.157 --> 00:55:35.740]  They're the ones doing this to shut down society, to collapse it, to consolidate control, to then carry out their transhumanist operations.
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:41.522]  JP Morgan's CEO says hurricane is coming for the US economy.
[00:55:41.582 --> 00:55:42.282]  Brace yourself.
[00:55:43.891 --> 00:55:48.016]  Fuel and food inflation crisis all stem from globalist policies.
[00:55:48.076 --> 00:55:49.918]  Excellent article from Zero Hedge.
[00:55:50.339 --> 00:55:55.164]  JP sees oil rising 136 this month, depending on what China does.
[00:55:57.747 --> 00:56:00.531]  As major traders bet millions on crude.
[00:56:01.866 --> 00:56:04.687]  Explosion to $200 a barrel, all-time high.
[00:56:05.547 --> 00:56:08.188]  Oil, little change after OPEC agrees to boost output.
[00:56:08.868 --> 00:56:13.909]  Looming price hikes on food set to hit Americans even harder this fall.
[00:56:14.929 --> 00:56:23.832]  And then the UN put out a press release saying, oh, they have a solution to the global crisis, it's all Russia's fault when it's worldwide inflation is the lion's share of it.
[00:56:24.452 --> 00:56:28.653]  Farm inflation, prices surge on chickens, eggs, wheat, corn, and milk.
[00:56:29.694 --> 00:56:31.655]  All by design.
[00:56:32.016 --> 00:56:36.018]  Government officials blame Biden for inflationary surge hurting most Americans.
[00:56:36.699 --> 00:56:41.462]  Because then he gets to blame, and the New World Order and the Davos Group don't get to blame.
[00:56:41.942 --> 00:56:45.705]  They get to pose as the saviors.
[00:56:46.701 --> 00:56:47.721]  And I keep going back to that.
[00:56:48.242 --> 00:56:58.906]  They will continue to shut down civilization, they will continue to implode the borders, they will continue to carry out their operations, as long as they're not getting the blame.
[00:56:59.287 --> 00:57:06.250]  Exposing who the enemy is, the type of attack we're under, that's critical to them stopping.
[00:57:06.510 --> 00:57:09.111]  It's a very simple equation.
[00:57:10.936 --> 00:57:19.784]  I want to take first-time callers specifically on the chemtrails, the geoengineering, what we covered last hour on that one topic.
[00:57:19.804 --> 00:57:22.467]  877-789-2539.
[00:57:22.487 --> 00:57:23.388]  877-789-2539.
[00:57:23.408 --> 00:57:24.469]  877-789.
[00:57:24.649 --> 00:57:27.852]  Alex, your phone calls are coming up on this and more.
[00:57:27.872 --> 00:57:28.492]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:29.093 --> 00:57:36.520]  So a private corporate world government that would make Hitler blush is in control of the planet right now.
[00:57:38.177 --> 00:57:43.219]  You can deny this is going on, or you can see the documents and their own statements for yourself and decide to not go along with it.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:59.326]  But let's look at what's currently happening with the attempt to take over our bodies and our bodily autonomy, and to say the system owns our bodies, with a shot that isn't a vaccine, that was experimental, that was given waivers, that doesn't work.
[00:58:00.587 --> 00:58:01.607]  In the way they say it does.
[00:58:01.947 --> 00:58:03.168]  Oh, it certainly works the other ways.
[00:58:03.828 --> 00:58:05.629]  Turn off your immune system ahead of the next attack.
[00:58:06.667 --> 00:58:12.970]  Pfizer asked FDA to authorize its COVID vaccine for children from 6 months to 4 years old.
[00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:18.312]  Which will then give them liability protection from all the lawsuits.
[00:58:19.713 --> 00:58:20.153]  Report!
[00:58:20.213 --> 00:58:26.776]  Hunter Biden linked Ukraine Biolabs' work with COVID-19 research 3 months before the pandemic began, a Kellogg-McGreen article.
[00:58:28.090 --> 00:58:28.731]  So incredible.
[00:58:29.171 --> 00:58:37.837]  And that's in the Wuhan lab documents as well that months before they were calling it COVID-19 and they had it and it was genetically engineered.
[00:58:38.358 --> 00:58:39.759]  This is from the DOD.
[00:58:40.539 --> 00:58:42.441]  Absolutely bombshell.
[00:58:42.861 --> 00:58:44.602]  We can spend four hours on that alone.
[00:58:46.384 --> 00:58:48.345]  Another big report by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:58:48.906 --> 00:58:50.307]  COVID restrictions are coming back.
[00:58:50.987 --> 00:58:52.048]  They're getting them all ready.
[00:58:52.088 --> 00:58:54.210]  They just gave you a respite to kill political will.
[00:58:55.529 --> 00:58:57.970]  And then they're going to bring it all back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:58.090 --> 00:58:59.131]  And then I've got this clip.
[00:59:00.752 --> 00:59:01.873]  We're going to play next segment.
[00:59:03.314 --> 00:59:11.714]   Fauci openly admits Biden mass mandate is about preserving authority.
[00:59:11.714 --> 00:59:17.394]  Imagine that.
[00:59:17.394 --> 00:59:20.603]   Oh Oh, we want the power to do this whenever we want.
[00:59:20.703 --> 00:59:21.944]  That's why we're bringing it back.
[00:59:23.653 --> 00:59:27.893]   In the same interview he announced he's going to be stepping down soon because he's been
[00:59:27.893 --> 00:59:32.693]   politically destroyed and no longer useful for them after he ran the AIDS operation,
[00:59:32.693 --> 00:59:36.773]   the HIV operation, and so much more. That's the start of the next segment.
[00:59:36.773 --> 00:59:44.614]   And then I will go to your phone calls, Greg, Tristan, Jacob, Toby, Dominique, Anthony, and others.
[00:59:44.730 --> 00:59:47.471]  Very important clip right there.
[00:59:48.491 --> 00:59:52.232]  Stop the spread by not having sex, says the UK.
[00:59:52.352 --> 00:59:55.193]  A monkey pox is basically non-existence.
[00:59:55.893 --> 00:59:57.473]  Negative vaccine effectiveness.
[00:59:57.573 --> 00:59:58.974]  The fact checks were wrong.
[00:59:59.014 --> 01:00:07.376]  They weren't wrong, they lied on purpose last autumn, and they're even more wrong now, says the Daily Skeptic, laying out the actual statistics and numbers.
[01:00:08.624 --> 01:00:13.355]  Big interview yesterday that's at Bandot Video that needs to be seen if you missed it and shared.
[01:00:14.116 --> 01:00:18.746]  Economist whistleblower who predicted COVID tyranny breaks down how to fight the next lockdown.
[01:00:21.016 --> 01:00:21.336]  U.S.
[01:00:21.356 --> 01:00:25.259]  Census data skewed in favor of Democrats rigging future elections.
[01:00:25.279 --> 01:00:28.021]  We've got more on that coming up as well.
[01:00:28.641 --> 01:00:39.929]  So when we see stories like crackhead MILF and incest porn, Hunter Biden's search history revealed he texts his dad the Pornhub link to his profile.
[01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:42.791]  Yeah, that's red meat for everybody.
[01:00:44.112 --> 01:00:45.934]  But what does it do to stop nuclear war?
[01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:50.317]  You know, a lot of people are asking me, why aren't you covering the Johnny Depp verdict?
[01:00:51.474 --> 01:00:52.335]  Of course she lied.
[01:00:52.915 --> 01:00:57.577]  Of course the anti-Civil Liberties Union was involved in it.
[01:00:58.318 --> 01:01:02.020]  Great for Johnny Depp, the anti-gun guy that said he hopes Trump's assassinated.
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.240]  Not against Johnny Depp.
[01:01:04.321 --> 01:01:12.866]  It's just that it's a diversion and a distraction from all the actual, real, serious things that are going on in this world.
[01:01:14.506 --> 01:01:18.709]  And what the globalists have planned for us and our families.
[01:01:19.858 --> 01:01:28.885]  But when we look at the entire depopulation agenda that is unfolding, everybody makes a joke out of it.
[01:01:28.965 --> 01:01:47.639]  I want to play a few minutes from Bill Maher's last show, where he shows the statistics of 1% of people identified as homosexual in the 1940s, and now with children, it's approaching half in blue cities and controlled areas.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:48.980]  What does that do?
[01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:53.347]  Because David Hogg famously made the joke, Jones is against gay frogs, we're all gay frogs.
[01:01:53.647 --> 01:01:56.248]  Well, gay frogs don't have any more frogs, they die.
[01:01:57.428 --> 01:01:59.529]  So it's, why are the globalists doing this?
[01:02:00.469 --> 01:02:16.273]  Well, they're selling depopulation as a political movement, and as something cool and fun, so you don't notice why you're sterilized, and why you can't have children, plus it won't matter, because you don't want the responsibility of children or a future, you are just partying while the world burns.
[01:02:18.263 --> 01:02:25.825]  And so even Bill Maher a few weeks ago said, why is it Democrat areas are half transgender or half gay?
[01:02:26.526 --> 01:02:28.426]  Why is it in the red areas?
[01:02:28.486 --> 01:02:34.528]  Because it's political and it's children being targeted with a sexual agenda.
[01:02:35.088 --> 01:02:37.369]  So we'll play a few minutes of Bill Maher.
[01:02:37.449 --> 01:02:37.969]  Go to break.
[01:02:38.469 --> 01:02:42.190]  Come back, hit this Fauci clip and go to your phone calls here today.
[01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:43.271]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:02:43.291 --> 01:02:43.671]  Stay with us.
[01:02:45.616 --> 01:02:53.081]  And finally, Newell, if something about the human race is changing at a previously unprecedented rate, we have to at least discuss it.
[01:02:54.082 --> 01:03:01.026]  Broken down over time, the LGBT population of America seems to be roughly doubling every generation.
[01:03:01.767 --> 01:03:10.833]  According to a recent Gallup poll, less than 1% of Americans born before 1946, that's Joe Biden's generation, identify that way.
[01:03:11.608 --> 01:03:19.608]   4.6% of boomers do, 4.2% of Gen X, 10.5% of millennials, and 20.8% of Gen Z.
[01:03:19.608 --> 01:03:24.608]   Which means if we follow this trajectory, we will all be gay in 2054.
[01:03:24.608 --> 01:03:36.608]  [laughter]
[01:03:36.608 --> 01:03:38.608]  And then who's going to buy this chair?
[01:03:38.608 --> 01:03:41.608]  (audience laughing)
[01:03:42.116 --> 01:03:47.419]  I'm just saying that when things change this much, this fast, people are allowed to ask, what's up with that?
[01:03:49.019 --> 01:03:50.700]  All the babies are in the wrong bodies?
[01:03:52.141 --> 01:03:56.641]   Was there a mix-up at the plant? Like with Cap'n Crunch's "Oops, All Berries"?
[01:03:56.641 --> 01:04:09.141]   It wasn't that long ago when adults asked a kid, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"
[01:04:09.269 --> 01:04:11.269]  They meant what profession?
[01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:13.269]  [laughter]
[01:04:13.269 --> 01:04:18.269]  [applause]
[01:04:18.269 --> 01:04:25.709]   In the wake of America about to lose abortion rights, the ACLU recently tweeted a list of those who would be
[01:04:25.709 --> 01:04:28.269]  disproportionately harmed by this.
[01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:31.212]  You would think women might top that list?
[01:04:31.832 --> 01:04:31.993]  No.
[01:04:32.213 --> 01:04:33.093]  Wasn't even on the list.
[01:04:33.554 --> 01:04:35.695]  Second on the list was LGBT.
[01:04:36.036 --> 01:04:36.316]  Really?
[01:04:37.357 --> 01:04:42.621]  Abortion rights affects gay and trans people more than, you know, breeders?
[01:04:46.329 --> 01:04:52.055]  I'm happy for LGBT folks that we now live in an age where they can live their authentic lives openly.
[01:04:52.075 --> 01:04:55.920]  And we should always be mindful of respecting and protecting.
[01:04:56.801 --> 01:04:57.942]  But someone needs to say it.
[01:04:58.142 --> 01:05:05.142]  Not everything's about you.
[01:05:05.142 --> 01:05:11.262]   And it's okay to ask questions about something that's very new and involves
[01:05:11.262 --> 01:05:11.821]  children.
[01:05:12.407 --> 01:05:19.774]  The answer can't always be that anyone from a marginalized community is automatically right, trump card, mic drop, end of discussion.
[01:05:20.575 --> 01:05:22.857]  Because we're literally experimenting on children.
[01:05:23.678 --> 01:05:28.202]  Maybe that's why Sweden and Finland have stopped giving puberty blockers to kids.
[01:05:28.809 --> 01:05:31.733]  Because we just don't know much about the long-term effects.
[01:05:32.113 --> 01:05:38.782]  Although common sense should tell you that when you reverse the course of raging hormones, there's going to be problems.
[01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:45.912]  We do know it hinders the development of bone density, which is kind of important if you like having a skeleton.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:55.203]  Fertility and the ability to have an orgasm seem also to be affected.
[01:05:55.263 --> 01:05:57.224]  This isn't just a lifestyle decision.
[01:05:57.324 --> 01:05:57.944]  It's medical.
[01:05:57.984 --> 01:06:01.526]  All right, we're going to your phone calls here on the geoengineering.
[01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:02.727]  Last hour I covered it.
[01:06:03.347 --> 01:06:09.611]  UN, EU documents, Spanish documents admit they're spraying to stop COVID pesticides on you.
[01:06:10.111 --> 01:06:11.412]  Wow, what an announcement.
[01:06:11.912 --> 01:06:14.694]  We showed you video clips of the CIA director and others admitting it all.
[01:06:16.155 --> 01:06:17.936]  But I could play the whole 10-minute clip.
[01:06:17.956 --> 01:06:19.537]  We just played like three minutes of Bill Maher.
[01:06:21.636 --> 01:06:25.057]  Or he's sitting there going, these property blockers hurt children.
[01:06:25.718 --> 01:06:32.620]  They make them sick, they stunt their growth, they kill their bones, they ruin their sexual future, they sterilize them.
[01:06:33.361 --> 01:06:34.161]  Why are we doing this?
[01:06:34.921 --> 01:06:38.122]  Well, it's the corporate world directing it all.
[01:06:39.843 --> 01:06:40.743]  And we have the documents.
[01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:41.984]  It's in the film Endgame.
[01:06:42.504 --> 01:06:45.385]  Promote homosexuality to depopulate.
[01:06:45.725 --> 01:06:46.926]  We don't hate somebody.
[01:06:48.126 --> 01:06:50.928]  Because of who they're attracted to or who they love.
[01:06:51.348 --> 01:06:51.948]  They're an adult.
[01:06:52.348 --> 01:06:54.509]  But we do see the agenda being pushed here.
[01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:56.931]  Here's a very powerful meme.
[01:06:57.371 --> 01:07:02.694]  Shows a C-130 full of coffins draped with American flags of dead servicemen and women coming home.
[01:07:03.314 --> 01:07:04.495]  It says, they get one day.
[01:07:04.515 --> 01:07:09.337]  Then it shows a bunch of men, big fat men dressed as clowns calling them women.
[01:07:10.198 --> 01:07:11.318]  They get one month.
[01:07:13.019 --> 01:07:18.629]   Corporate-driven Pride Month relentlessly mocked With fabulous memes.
[01:07:19.030 --> 01:07:20.510]  They don't care because they've got your children.
[01:07:21.731 --> 01:07:25.532]  Poll finds most Americans reject the idea of kids choosing preferred pronouns.
[01:07:25.572 --> 01:07:27.553]  They're not teaching them reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[01:07:27.933 --> 01:07:29.614]  They're teaching them to be part of the sex cult.
[01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:31.655]  U.S.
[01:07:31.695 --> 01:07:32.655]  Marines ridiculed.
[01:07:32.695 --> 01:07:33.416]  It's not a joke.
[01:07:33.516 --> 01:07:36.177]  It's not a spoof on Full Metal Jack and Stanley Kubrick.
[01:07:36.697 --> 01:07:36.957]  U.S.
[01:07:36.977 --> 01:07:41.119]  Marines ridiculed over gay bullets tweet will shoot you with the rainbow.
[01:07:42.796 --> 01:07:51.843]  Don't ask Mercedes-Benz what they were building from 1938 to 1945, asked Jack Posobiec, as they don't do the rainbow ads in the Middle East or other places, but just here.
[01:07:51.863 --> 01:07:56.847]  And of course Mercedes was building Panzer tanks for the Nazis.
[01:07:57.908 --> 01:08:03.212]  MSM Racebaiter claims fears over gun control are like resurgence of KKK.
[01:08:03.592 --> 01:08:05.514]  The KKK didn't want black people to be armed.
[01:08:05.874 --> 01:08:14.752]   The NRA Was founded, ladies and gentlemen, to train northerners and blacks how to own guns, and how to shoot.
[01:08:15.333 --> 01:08:23.178]  Teammate of transgender swimmer Leah Thomas claims you pin silenced, intimidated female swimmers who brought up concerns, even have the letters.
[01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:29.522]  So not just you have to accept a man competing against you, you gotta shut your dirty piehole, you evil Americans.
[01:08:29.582 --> 01:08:31.760]   And meanwhile, As the U.S.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:38.765]  economy faces recession, they engineered the global elite to push AI babies to cut down on world population.
[01:08:38.825 --> 01:08:42.968]  And it just gets more insane from there.
[01:08:43.868 --> 01:08:48.131]  Expert predicts AI tech children will solve population problem.
[01:08:48.391 --> 01:08:49.652]  You'll have a virtual child.
[01:08:50.669 --> 01:08:56.255]  Won't be as alive as your Chia Pet or even your Pet Rock, but still, that's what it is.
[01:08:56.896 --> 01:09:10.171]  All right, let's go to this Fauci clip saying the quiet part out loud that, oh, Biden's gone to the federal appeals court to reinstate the mask mandate on airplanes and other federal transportation like trains because it's about power.
[01:09:10.251 --> 01:09:10.632]  Here it is.
[01:09:11.488 --> 01:09:23.484]  So Doctor, at the same time the Justice Department is pushing an appeals court to intervene on this ruling that lifts mask mandates on public transportation, mass transit, that sort of thing.
[01:09:24.045 --> 01:09:24.746]  What do you think of that?
[01:09:28.119 --> 01:09:35.181]  Are you asking me what I think about the Justice Department appealing this court decision about pulling back?
[01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:35.741]  Exactly.
[01:09:36.502 --> 01:09:51.986]  You know, one of the issues, Neil, that I have articulated in the past, and I will in the future, it's less about mandates on the plane than it is about who has the right and the authority and the capability of making public health decisions.
[01:09:52.587 --> 01:10:02.131]   And I believe that the Department of Justice is operating on the principle That decisions that are public health decisions belong with the public health agency.
[01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:04.553]  In this case, the CDC.
[01:10:05.033 --> 01:10:12.118]  So it's more of a matter of principle of where the authority lies than it is about whether or not there's going to be a mandate on a plane or not.
[01:10:12.338 --> 01:10:17.984]  But do you personally, Doc, I mean, when you travel and when you go around, do you prefer wearing a mask yourself?
[01:10:18.104 --> 01:10:20.827]  I know you've avoided public venues and large gatherings.
[01:10:20.867 --> 01:10:23.690]  I think the White House Correspondent Center comes to mind.
[01:10:24.371 --> 01:10:27.314]  Do you still have those reservations, even now?
[01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:29.930]  You know, I do.
[01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:36.472]  I mean, the CDC continues to recommend that when people fly, that they wear masks.
[01:10:36.552 --> 01:10:44.715]  Now, the mandate has been pulled back on the decision of the court, but that does not change the recommendation of the CDC.
[01:10:44.735 --> 01:10:48.216]  He needs to be in a Supermax prison, not on television.
[01:10:48.596 --> 01:10:51.017]  He engineered the virus with Bill Gates and Peter Daszak.
[01:10:51.317 --> 01:10:52.277]  He launched it on us.
[01:10:52.317 --> 01:10:53.358]  He blocked therapeutics.
[01:10:53.658 --> 01:10:55.178]  He put sick people in nursing homes.
[01:10:55.518 --> 01:10:57.379]  The man is a monster.
[01:10:59.906 --> 01:11:00.687]  Go ahead and kill that clip.
[01:11:00.707 --> 01:11:01.627]  I still hear foul to you, Mayor.
[01:11:02.568 --> 01:11:02.848]  Thanks.
[01:11:03.769 --> 01:11:09.454]  So, let's go to your phone calls right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:10.895 --> 01:11:13.397]  Let's take a caller from Wisconsin, Ken.
[01:11:13.437 --> 01:11:14.458]  Ken, thanks for calling.
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:17.480]  Hello, Alex.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.081]  Can you hear me?
[01:11:18.381 --> 01:11:18.922]  I sure can.
[01:11:19.822 --> 01:11:20.303]  Super.
[01:11:20.703 --> 01:11:25.947]  Man, I'm glad you got the subject of geoengineering going on here on your program.
[01:11:25.967 --> 01:11:28.850]  You know, I've been on this for a long, long time.
[01:11:29.582 --> 01:11:32.323]  I just want to throw a couple of numbers at you if I may here.
[01:11:33.003 --> 01:11:45.865]  You know, I've taken many samples of both rainwater and snow from up here in these parts, in the northern tier, and sent these samples off to non-government labs to have it analyzed.
[01:11:46.305 --> 01:11:51.966]  I've done aluminum, I've done barium, manganese, and other tests.
[01:11:52.746 --> 01:11:55.387]  And my latest from last year blew my mind.
[01:11:57.819 --> 01:12:01.943]  I mentioned to you that there's a reporting limit, especially say for aluminum or barium.
[01:12:02.744 --> 01:12:11.793]  The reporting limit, anything over 100 parts per billion, I believe it's billion, I could be wrong, is to be reported.
[01:12:11.933 --> 01:12:15.396]  To whom is to be reported at EPA, I'm not sure.
[01:12:16.057 --> 01:12:19.720]  But I will tell you this, it never changes on the reporting limit.
[01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:20.501]  100 parts per.
[01:12:21.923 --> 01:12:26.766]  Last year came, just on the aluminum results, 6,200.
[01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:31.629]  This is in our breathing column that we breathe.
[01:12:32.329 --> 01:12:36.092]  The barium is 2.5, never changes, always 2.5.
[01:12:36.972 --> 01:12:39.073]  Anything over that, to be reported.
[01:12:39.514 --> 01:12:40.754]  It was at 91 parts per.
[01:12:42.076 --> 01:12:45.240]  So this is in our air column, and we're breathing this, Alex.
[01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:49.385]  And I know there's a lot of other people out there that know about this.
[01:12:50.086 --> 01:12:51.988]  I've dug deep into it.
[01:12:52.188 --> 01:13:00.759]  I picked up a book not too long ago by Peter A. Kirby on Camp Trails Exposed, a new Manhattan project.
[01:13:01.405 --> 01:13:03.327]  Plenty of information on that too, Alex.
[01:13:03.668 --> 01:13:07.893]  Oh yeah, there's a lot of great books and stuff, but I mean, it's admitted in the UN documents last hour.
[01:13:08.333 --> 01:13:10.716]  We show they're now putting pesticides in the spray.
[01:13:11.377 --> 01:13:14.000]  So, researchers always debate whether it exists or not.
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.242]  They do that as a way to keep us in a debate.
[01:13:16.663 --> 01:13:17.323]  It exists.
[01:13:17.804 --> 01:13:18.665]  Where is Congress?
[01:13:18.725 --> 01:13:19.486]  Where are the governors?
[01:13:19.926 --> 01:13:20.968]  We need to expose this.
[01:13:22.011 --> 01:13:23.072]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:13:23.152 --> 01:13:36.423]  I mean, this is a taboo subject, and you can be assured there are plenty, plenty of folks in a position, from senators to congressmen and women in Washington, they know this is going on.
[01:13:36.764 --> 01:13:41.728]  They do know it's going on, because Dane Wiginton and another friend of his had been out there at one time.
[01:13:42.088 --> 01:13:46.649]  Trying to run this all through them and they just paid no attention to them whatsoever.
[01:13:46.969 --> 01:13:52.751]  They just closed their little doors behind them and not to be discussed or disclosed.
[01:13:52.871 --> 01:13:58.473]  It's a taboo subject and climate change, yeah it's real, but it's coming from overhead.
[01:13:58.673 --> 01:14:04.274]  It ain't coming from our cars and our motorcycles and our lawnmowers.
[01:14:04.294 --> 01:14:05.935]  That's a bunch of junk.
[01:14:06.738 --> 01:14:07.639]  Beautifully said, sir.
[01:14:07.699 --> 01:14:07.999]  Thank you.
[01:14:08.019 --> 01:14:22.270]  Yeah, I mean, for people that just tuned in, I spent the whole first hour on this, showing documents and news clips and all of it, and it is admitted that they're spraying not just aluminum dioxide, barium salts, other things on us, they're spraying biocides.
[01:14:22.931 --> 01:14:25.092]  And they go, oh, it's to stop COVID.
[01:14:25.973 --> 01:14:27.274]  But there's no debate about it.
[01:14:28.075 --> 01:14:29.516]  Instead, they go, oh, it doesn't exist.
[01:14:29.916 --> 01:14:32.238]  But they do press releases, how they're doing it.
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:38.362]  Then when we challenge it, they always make it a debate about whether it exists or not.
[01:14:38.462 --> 01:14:41.243]  Not about, is it right what they're doing?
[01:14:41.323 --> 01:14:42.464]  This is how they play the game.
[01:14:42.804 --> 01:14:45.165]  Like critical race theory a year ago.
[01:14:46.786 --> 01:14:48.966]  Corporate media said it doesn't exist.
[01:14:49.046 --> 01:14:49.747]  It's not happening.
[01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:54.389]  And when folks exposed it was happening, they went, okay, here's the FBI.
[01:14:56.653 --> 01:14:57.534]  You can't criticize them.
[01:14:58.195 --> 01:15:00.538]  So they never have a face-to-face debate.
[01:15:00.558 --> 01:15:03.422]  They never respect you and actually engage you in discussion.
[01:15:03.902 --> 01:15:07.888]  They just deny it to your face while it's in all the public documents and they're doing it.
[01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:11.271]  Dominique and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[01:15:11.751 --> 01:15:24.856]  On the other side of this quick break, I'm Alex Jones, your host, NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com, Band.Video, a revolutionary act to share that URL and to share those videos and articles.
[01:15:25.277 --> 01:15:26.517]  Band.Video.
[01:15:27.297 --> 01:15:28.278]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:28.338 --> 01:15:29.578]  On the other side, stay with us.
[01:15:32.202 --> 01:15:33.343]  It's right now.
[01:15:33.403 --> 01:15:35.245]  It's kind of sunny things are doing fine.
[01:15:35.265 --> 01:15:42.253]  You know, everyone thinks that the Fed can handle this that hurricane is right out there down the road coming our way.
[01:15:42.733 --> 01:15:50.081]  We just don't know if it's a minor one or Superstorm Sandy or Sandy or or Andrew or something like that.
[01:15:50.221 --> 01:15:52.624]  And it's you better brace yourself.
[01:15:54.372 --> 01:16:05.696]  So they've engineered the collapse, they've done everything they could to do it, and now their head generals are telling you to be your savior like when Bill Gates predicted the COVID situation.
[01:16:07.957 --> 01:16:09.578]  We're going back to your phone calls right now.
[01:16:10.378 --> 01:16:14.660]  Let's talk to Dominique in Chicago on the chemtrails and the open announcements.
[01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:15.760]  What do you make of that, Dominique?
[01:16:16.741 --> 01:16:17.841]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:16:17.901 --> 01:16:18.681]  Long time listener.
[01:16:18.701 --> 01:16:19.822]  I've been listening since the late 90s.
[01:16:20.866 --> 01:16:22.808]  I just wanted to make a few points here.
[01:16:22.868 --> 01:16:24.990]  My parents immigrated from Poland.
[01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:27.412]  My grandparents came here from Poland.
[01:16:27.492 --> 01:16:31.916]  I have videotapes from the 80s of me playing in my backyard.
[01:16:32.396 --> 01:16:34.258]  The sky's always been crystal clear.
[01:16:34.278 --> 01:16:35.599]  Not a single chemtrail.
[01:16:36.099 --> 01:16:39.522]  Sometimes starting in the late 80s, 90s, they started spraying, right?
[01:16:39.622 --> 01:16:42.164]  Over here, they spray on a schedule.
[01:16:42.565 --> 01:16:44.586]  They start at 1030 a.m.
[01:16:45.487 --> 01:16:47.429]  and they're always flying at a higher elevation.
[01:16:49.321 --> 01:17:00.266]  Now, if you take binoculars or a telescope, the planes that are spraying are unmarked planes, whereas the regular planes flying at a lower altitude, they're all commercial planes.
[01:17:00.927 --> 01:17:05.929]  So they're always spraying at a regular schedule and they take days off.
[01:17:06.209 --> 01:17:12.652]  So the day before Memorial Day, the day before Labor Day, the day before New Year's Day, they don't spray.
[01:17:12.772 --> 01:17:13.953]  They have those days off.
[01:17:14.633 --> 01:17:20.607]   And then my last point is, That I'm very sensitive to my surroundings, to the food I put in my body, to what I drink.
[01:17:21.448 --> 01:17:24.150]  Within hours of them spraying, I get really tired.
[01:17:24.530 --> 01:17:25.811]  And it happens to a lot of people.
[01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:32.957]  And I notice the days that people are tired and they're not feeling good, I look up and lo and behold, they've been spraying since 10.30.
[01:17:33.237 --> 01:17:34.798]  Well, I mean, let me say this, Dominique.
[01:17:34.898 --> 01:17:37.540]  You know, I've been on since the mid-1990s covering this.
[01:17:38.221 --> 01:17:41.724]  That before, condensation trails didn't persist, and then they did.
[01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:53.473]  Almost no one I know fighting this goes, oh, here's a UN document, or here's the former head of the CIA, or here's the Spanish government admitting they're doing it.
[01:17:53.693 --> 01:17:55.493]  And so we always just, hey, I saw it.
[01:17:55.873 --> 01:17:56.753]  Hey, it's up there.
[01:17:57.113 --> 01:18:06.175]  I understand you're observing that, but we need to codify what they're doing and show their own admissions when we debate this.
[01:18:07.056 --> 01:18:10.336]  Because everybody I know just says, hey, this didn't used to happen, now it happens.
[01:18:10.797 --> 01:18:12.297]  Kids growing up never do it any different.
[01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:16.512]  So does that make sense when I'm saying that we have the documents?
[01:18:16.852 --> 01:18:18.673]  It's not like we're trying to prove it's happening.
[01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:19.673]  They admit it's happening.
[01:18:21.054 --> 01:18:21.774]  Yes, I agree.
[01:18:21.834 --> 01:18:22.194]  I agree.
[01:18:22.234 --> 01:18:32.777]  I mean, there needs to be government commissions and committees looking into this and contacting your local authorities and your local politicians and telling them to look at this and they're asking questions.
[01:18:32.857 --> 01:18:39.410]   And one last thing that I wanted to mention is that there are Disney movie covers now I agree and I appreciate your call, Dominic.
[01:18:39.230 --> 01:18:45.529]   where the background sky is showing the chemtrails digitally inserted
[01:18:45.529 --> 01:18:50.730]   into the actual graphic of the movies so that they can get all the youth and all
[01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:54.530]   the kids watching the Pixar and Disney movies to get them used to the chemtrails.
[01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:58.210]   I agree and I appreciate your call Dominic. Here's what I'm getting at.
[01:18:58.210 --> 01:19:04.890]   We still have debates whether world government and the Great Reset exists.
[01:19:02.865 --> 01:19:04.585]  They're announcing they're going to collapse things.
[01:19:04.866 --> 01:19:06.186]  They're announcing you'll own nothing.
[01:19:06.206 --> 01:19:07.766]  They're announcing they're going to have a World ID.
[01:19:08.046 --> 01:19:09.727]  They're announcing they're taking your bodies over.
[01:19:10.007 --> 01:19:15.849]  And we just keep having debates about whether it exists or not because the corporate media says, hey, world government, hey, World ID.
[01:19:15.969 --> 01:19:16.849]  Oh, but it doesn't exist.
[01:19:17.813 --> 01:19:29.903]  And so they keep us in this game, they keep us in this joke, and I'm trying to develop how do we have an open debate about this, to just say, we know you're doing it, you admit you're doing it, now stop it.
[01:19:30.943 --> 01:19:32.585]  Toby in West Virginia, welcome Toby.
[01:19:34.546 --> 01:19:35.607]  Thanks for having me.
[01:19:35.667 --> 01:19:40.531]  First off, I just want to say thank you to everything you do and the people here at InfoWars, greatly appreciate it all.
[01:19:41.458 --> 01:19:45.820]  First off, in regards to chemtrails, correct me if I'm wrong, but I'd love to hear your take on it.
[01:19:46.180 --> 01:19:55.624]  I believe it's like a three-phase thing as to where they control pH of the food, they geoengineer seeds that are resilient against aluminum, and they control the food supply.
[01:19:56.144 --> 01:20:02.006]  Also wondering if they're going to work in a way to have it work with vaccines and other types of scenarios to where they can control illness.
[01:20:02.746 --> 01:20:03.887]  What do you think about those ideas?
[01:20:04.437 --> 01:20:05.377]  Well, they're not ideas.
[01:20:05.438 --> 01:20:08.459]  It's admitted that Monsanto 20 years ago came out.
[01:20:08.479 --> 01:20:12.401]  They're developing everything for aluminum-resistant seeds where nobody else can grow.
[01:20:12.421 --> 01:20:14.602]  But then, yeah, that's one phase of the operation.
[01:20:14.882 --> 01:20:18.384]  While they give us Alzheimer's and neurological disorders and while they attack us.
[01:20:19.684 --> 01:20:20.085]  Yes, sir.
[01:20:20.205 --> 01:20:20.605]  Yes, sir.
[01:20:21.045 --> 01:20:26.691]   So how do we, when it's all admitted, Form a policy debate instead of debating whether it exists.
[01:20:26.711 --> 01:20:28.832]  Say, here it is, you admit you're doing it, stop it.
[01:20:29.133 --> 01:20:34.577]  You even heard the CIA director go, well, people may look at the policy and get upset, that's why we gotta keep it secret.
[01:20:34.617 --> 01:20:36.598]  But they admit the secret program's going on.
[01:20:37.959 --> 01:20:38.980]  Yeah, very true.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:44.164]  I mean, truthfully, it makes me think about who's running it, if it's going on all throughout the world, all over countries.
[01:20:44.604 --> 01:20:51.009]  Technically, they're declaring war, an act of war on everybody, because they're, like you're saying, they're trying to hurt all innocent people in certain areas.
[01:20:51.502 --> 01:20:52.323]  Again, we know who's doing it.
[01:20:52.182 --> 01:20:55.483]   the whole world, then obviously that's almost like a genocide type approach.
[01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:59.981]   But technically people will be held accountable to law based on that, I guess, notion.
[01:20:59.981 --> 01:21:04.983]   But as to figure out who's doing it, that's the main thing we need to figure out.
[01:21:04.983 --> 01:21:07.542]  And again, we know who's doing it.
[01:21:07.542 --> 01:21:15.582]  It's a United Nations treaty carrying out this operation.
[01:21:15.582 --> 01:21:19.502]  They admit it's being done under the treaty.
[01:21:19.502 --> 01:21:22.422]  and we've covered the treaties, and it's going on.
[01:21:22.915 --> 01:21:28.718]  And so we're always at the level of debating whether it's happening or not, while they simultaneously launch the operation.
[01:21:28.758 --> 01:21:29.638]  Thank you so much, Toby.
[01:21:29.958 --> 01:21:30.599]  Beautiful points.
[01:21:31.319 --> 01:21:32.240]  Anthony in Florida.
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:32.920]  Anthony, welcome.
[01:21:35.481 --> 01:21:36.001]  Hey, Alex.
[01:21:37.042 --> 01:21:41.404]  I just want to let you know that the wife and I send prayers over for you and the crew every night.
[01:21:42.606 --> 01:21:44.767]  Um, we support the store as much as we can.
[01:21:44.787 --> 01:21:45.328]  Thank you.
[01:21:46.648 --> 01:21:51.171]  And I'm over here in East Florida and we got NASA over here and Space Force.
[01:21:51.291 --> 01:21:53.952]  And I'll tell you what, man, it was like middle of May.
[01:21:54.492 --> 01:22:01.116]  I was at work and I saw like white crystallized particles in the air one morning at work and I was like, eh, it's probably just allergies.
[01:22:01.396 --> 01:22:01.976]  No big deal.
[01:22:02.496 --> 01:22:04.057]  The next day I got really sick.
[01:22:05.138 --> 01:22:08.740]  Uh, I haven't been that sick since I got COVID in February of 2020.
[01:22:09.932 --> 01:22:19.577]  Well, you know, the Pentagon was approached by Daszak and Gates in 2017 and said we're going to spray aerosolized nanotech virus crystals of COVID-19 on everybody.
[01:22:19.937 --> 01:22:20.918]  That's mainline news.
[01:22:20.998 --> 01:22:23.920]  So, yeah, it's all, they're spraying you, brother.
[01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:25.861]  Absolutely.
[01:22:25.901 --> 01:22:29.002]  This NASA, they definitely do weather manipulation down here.
[01:22:29.683 --> 01:22:34.085]  And I'm in my 30s, you know, I take my vitamin D gummies all the time, my X3.
[01:22:34.105 --> 01:22:35.246]  So I'm healthy.
[01:22:35.286 --> 01:22:36.226]  I work out three days a week.
[01:22:36.687 --> 01:22:39.288]  And I was like, man, if I was older, this would probably have killed me.
[01:22:39.781 --> 01:22:41.022]  And I work with an older gentleman.
[01:22:41.062 --> 01:22:41.902]  He hasn't been back to work.
[01:22:41.922 --> 01:22:42.682]  It's been two weeks.
[01:22:42.942 --> 01:22:43.943]  That's the plan.
[01:22:43.983 --> 01:22:45.143]  I mean, it's to kill the boomers.
[01:22:46.324 --> 01:22:47.725]  Yeah, everybody's sick, man.
[01:22:49.025 --> 01:22:51.927]  And I think it was because I really believe in my heart.
[01:22:51.947 --> 01:22:53.087]  It's because they spray stuff here.
[01:22:54.248 --> 01:22:55.668]  Well, sir, you don't have to believe in your heart.
[01:22:55.848 --> 01:22:56.929]  Did you see the first hour?
[01:22:57.389 --> 01:23:01.251]  Where I laid all the documents and the UN and the EU and the admissions of it?
[01:23:02.231 --> 01:23:02.632]  Of course.
[01:23:02.672 --> 01:23:03.592]  I watch every day, Alex.
[01:23:04.915 --> 01:23:05.595]  Well, God bless you.
[01:23:05.615 --> 01:23:06.796]  I appreciate your call, Anthony.
[01:23:07.176 --> 01:23:08.057]  Let's take more calls.
[01:23:08.097 --> 01:23:09.277]  Let's talk to Mike in Texas.
[01:23:09.337 --> 01:23:11.358]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:23:11.419 --> 01:23:12.439]  Hey, good subject.
[01:23:12.499 --> 01:23:13.520]  Just wanted to call in.
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:15.441]  Everything's local, and you're right.
[01:23:15.481 --> 01:23:18.742]  We don't have to argue about whether it exists or not.
[01:23:19.123 --> 01:23:29.768]  For example, the Texas Agricultural Code, Title IX, Chapter 302, right here in Texas, Weather Modification and Control Grant Program.
[01:23:30.429 --> 01:23:45.389]   Also, the Texas Department of Licensing, And registration, believe it or not, is the control center, so if somebody wants to apply for a grant or do weather mods, they just have to go get a permit from the TDLR.
[01:23:45.829 --> 01:23:50.292]  But you understand, Mike, and that's a key point to make, that weather mod is only one part.
[01:23:50.312 --> 01:23:57.157]  They are spraying biocide or anti-life chemicals on us in their own documents I showed last hour.
[01:23:58.467 --> 01:24:00.028]  No, I completely get it.
[01:24:00.128 --> 01:24:03.969]  I've been on this topic for 13 or 14 years.
[01:24:04.029 --> 01:24:10.431]  I just, as a simple entry to get people off the fence, we can start with this and move into that.
[01:24:10.491 --> 01:24:17.293]  But what I'm saying is, whether that, we don't want to get it, let's fight them where we know we can, and then bring up the other documents as well.
[01:24:17.333 --> 01:24:21.214]  Maybe file a class action lawsuit.
[01:24:21.234 --> 01:24:26.436]  So, it's the Texas Agricultural Code, Title IX, Chapter 302 in Texas, if we want to get started.
[01:24:28.036 --> 01:24:29.417]  Where do you think this is going?
[01:24:29.457 --> 01:24:35.600]  Where they simultaneously admit it exists, but then simultaneously deny it, so there's never a debate.
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:36.741]  How do we override that?
[01:24:38.462 --> 01:24:39.683]  You know, it's unfortunate.
[01:24:39.863 --> 01:24:43.545]  Everything that they've done to us so far, as you well know, is incrementalism.
[01:24:44.205 --> 01:24:49.648]  And the more that we just... It's there every day, or the normalcy bias.
[01:24:50.129 --> 01:24:51.289]  We sit there and argue.
[01:24:51.349 --> 01:24:55.952]  I've had the same situation, you know, with family members as jets were going across the sky.
[01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:58.698]  Creating an X and spreading and so forth.
[01:24:59.179 --> 01:25:01.019]  It's almost a Stockholm syndrome.
[01:25:01.119 --> 01:25:08.921]  So my point would be let's start at a local level to get people involved to say, hey, look, let's here's no, there's no debate.
[01:25:08.961 --> 01:25:10.261]  Here's weather modification.
[01:25:10.741 --> 01:25:11.041]  Okay.
[01:25:11.301 --> 01:25:12.902]  But it's expanded into this.
[01:25:13.362 --> 01:25:17.243]  Let's take that and rally around that because people don't know what to do.
[01:25:17.283 --> 01:25:20.323]  We can all get upset and we can raise awareness and all this awareness.
[01:25:20.784 --> 01:25:21.984]  We've got to take action.
[01:25:22.064 --> 01:25:29.456]   And my point is, If people could see it for themselves, even here locally in the state of Texas, and say, holy crap, that really does exist?
[01:25:29.496 --> 01:25:30.136]  They can do that?
[01:25:30.677 --> 01:25:33.519]  That may start something, and we may have a foundation to fix it.
[01:25:33.539 --> 01:25:38.283]  No, I totally agree, because they are hitting us with the injections, the GMO, the chemtrails, all of it.
[01:25:38.563 --> 01:25:39.404]  Thank you so much, Mike.
[01:25:39.424 --> 01:25:41.966]  Alright, more calls straight ahead.
[01:25:41.986 --> 01:25:45.849]  Hour number three, and a bunch of other critical news.
[01:25:46.690 --> 01:25:47.310]  Straight ahead.
[01:25:47.451 --> 01:25:48.531]  Incredible information.
[01:25:48.951 --> 01:25:53.614]  You got to tune into that first hour later when we rebroadcast and once it's posted, it may not video.
[01:25:53.914 --> 01:25:55.055]  So we lay it all out there.
[01:25:55.595 --> 01:25:56.776]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:25:57.751 --> 01:26:03.855]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria, or pump gas, or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[01:26:04.115 --> 01:26:07.358]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[01:26:07.398 --> 01:26:08.118]  You see it every year.
[01:26:08.138 --> 01:26:10.480]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:21.267]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[01:26:21.287 --> 01:26:26.171]  So, it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[01:26:27.065 --> 01:26:32.529]  To be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep all your money.
[01:26:32.569 --> 01:26:36.792]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[01:26:37.132 --> 01:26:38.594]  The whole IRS is social engineering.
[01:26:38.614 --> 01:26:39.594]  It doesn't even run the country.
[01:26:39.915 --> 01:26:40.755]  They just print the money.
[01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:42.456]  This is so they're rich and powerful.
[01:26:43.637 --> 01:26:44.497]  ...can buy everything up.
[01:26:44.557 --> 01:26:49.859]  And so the public is basically being sapped to keep us non-competitive and consolidate control.
[01:26:49.879 --> 01:26:51.599]  That's basically feudalism.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:57.941]  And so the IRS puts out this report and says, well, we don't like this, we don't like that, even though it's the law.
[01:26:58.221 --> 01:27:02.103]  And people go, oh, well, the bully says, I don't get the same law as the elite.
[01:27:02.403 --> 01:27:04.883]  And then they just screw you over because you don't have knowledge.
[01:27:05.183 --> 01:27:06.044]  It's totally sick.
[01:27:06.284 --> 01:27:06.944]  It's totally evil.
[01:27:07.424 --> 01:27:09.966]  CPAs by their nature are not advocates.
[01:27:10.126 --> 01:27:11.567]  They are risk adverse.
[01:27:11.867 --> 01:27:16.490]  They just want to get the return done and not get in trouble themselves.
[01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:19.852]  They don't care about making sure you have the least amount of taxes paid.
[01:27:20.132 --> 01:27:33.099]   That's where an advocate, a tax attorney comes into the picture because What a tax attorney does, what we do, is we don't care what the IRS, what some clerk down there interpreted the Internal Revenue Manual to be.
[01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:35.881]  We know what the actual law is, and we will assert your rights.
[01:27:35.921 --> 01:27:41.204]  Because if you're right as a taxpayer to not pay one penny more than you owe... And let's explain, you guys cut to the chase.
[01:27:41.224 --> 01:27:45.726]  A lot of law firms, you've got CPH2, kind of drag you through, milk you, do all this stuff.
[01:27:46.186 --> 01:27:53.350]  In most cases, you just look at right away where they can save money, and then they legally lawfully do it, and then you guys just get a percentage of it, basically.
[01:27:53.770 --> 01:27:55.091]  What you need is an advocate.
[01:27:55.432 --> 01:28:01.217]  That's a legal representative who's going to fight for your rights and represent you upon that matter.
[01:28:01.337 --> 01:28:02.117]  That's what we do.
[01:28:02.538 --> 01:28:03.859]  And Alex, it's just like you said.
[01:28:04.139 --> 01:28:07.182]  It doesn't matter if you have money, if you don't have any money.
[01:28:07.542 --> 01:28:11.926]  You need to make sure you're paying the government who has admitted that they don't like you.
[01:28:12.026 --> 01:28:13.026]  They want to make you broke.
[01:28:13.087 --> 01:28:16.890]  They want to take away your dream of owning property and you rent.
[01:28:17.610 --> 01:28:20.593]  So that, you know, they can have their globalist agenda.
[01:28:20.953 --> 01:28:27.218]  Every cent that you pay to the government is going to things that you don't believe in.
[01:28:27.378 --> 01:28:32.042]  Ukraine, Hunter Biden's legal defense, etc, etc.
[01:28:32.462 --> 01:28:40.249]  So, it's your duty as a patriotic American to pay the least amount as possible to the regime, to the globalists.
[01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:42.911]  And we are experts in making that happen.
[01:28:43.051 --> 01:28:44.032]  They want people to be poor.
[01:28:44.662 --> 01:28:45.603]  And that makes me angry.
[01:28:45.703 --> 01:28:46.544]  I don't want people to be poor.
[01:28:47.265 --> 01:28:52.530]  And so, it's just such a no-brainer that everybody needs to call you guys at 833-900-4285.
[01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.991]  833-900-4285.

[01:29:53.816 --> 01:30:04.136]   All right, I'm gonna air a very powerful report by Greg Rees on how America can take back its
[01:30:04.136 --> 01:30:05.816]  nation in the world.
[01:30:06.017 --> 01:30:08.863]  And then throughout the next hour, we're taking your phone calls.
[01:30:08.682 --> 01:30:27.162]  Here's the report.
[01:30:27.633 --> 01:30:31.395]  Prior to 1999, they were practically non-existent.
[01:30:31.816 --> 01:30:34.557]  But today, they have almost become predictable.
[01:30:35.157 --> 01:30:42.081]  And if you are able to examine the evidence objectively, without getting emotional, a pattern can be recognized.
[01:30:43.439 --> 01:31:06.828]  Former Naval Intelligence Officer turned whistleblower, Milton William Cooper, wrote in his book, Behold a Pale Horse, published in 1991, that the CIA was using drugs and hypnosis on mental patients in order to persuade them to open fire on schoolyards, to inflame the anti-gun lobby, and do away with the Second Amendment.
[01:31:07.791 --> 01:31:13.373]  This probably sounds outlandishly evil, and it is, but the evidence is there.
[01:31:14.294 --> 01:31:20.936]  In the Columbine shootings of 1999, we are told that Eric Harris and Dylan Kleibolt acted alone.
[01:31:21.877 --> 01:31:30.240]  The town of Columbine, Colorado was created in 1958 for families and employees of the military-industrial complex.
[01:31:31.295 --> 01:31:46.134]  Eric and Dylan were arrested a year prior to the shooting and were allegedly sodomized by the arresting officer, which may sound crazy, but a local officer admitted to raping informants, which is a known method of trauma-based mind control.
[01:31:47.427 --> 01:31:58.972]  After this January incident, Eric and Dylan were put into a juvenile diversion program and prescribed SSRI drugs known to cause homicidal ideation.
[01:31:59.873 --> 01:32:04.895]  During this time, Eric Harris was making online death threats and bomb threats.
[01:32:05.495 --> 01:32:10.858]  Local police were aware of this and drafted a search warrant affidavit, but it was ignored.
[01:32:11.878 --> 01:32:16.663]  Eric and Dylan threatened revenge for the January incident in their yearbook.
[01:32:17.224 --> 01:32:22.489]  They produced a school video about their plans and began openly collecting weapons.
[01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:26.453]  All of this while on probation and nothing was done about it.
[01:32:27.294 --> 01:32:36.001]  During the shootings, the police stood outside the building and did nothing, while the sounds of automatic gunfire and explosions continued for hours.
[01:32:36.801 --> 01:32:50.792]  In official transcripts, there are over 100 witnesses who saw more than two shooters, and more than 40 witnesses who identified the same two men in their 30s, one balding and the other with a short military-style haircut.
[01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:56.877]  Several witnesses described the same adult male throwing a pipe bomb on the roof of the library.
[01:32:57.738 --> 01:33:00.640]  All of them certain that it wasn't Dylan or Eric.
[01:33:01.521 --> 01:33:06.866]  And all of this information pertaining to additional shooters has been redacted.
[01:33:08.058 --> 01:33:23.096]  The FBI agent in charge of the Columbine investigation had a son who recently attended the school, who shot a student film inside Columbine High two years before the shooting about a character wearing a trench coat shooting up the school.
[01:33:24.093 --> 01:33:32.297]  Dylan and Eric fantasized about hijacking an airplane and crashing it into a New York City skyscraper in 1999.
[01:33:33.397 --> 01:33:39.160]  Are these just strange coincidences or remnants of the Fed's MKUltra program?
[01:33:40.166 --> 01:34:02.541]   An honest investigation into any of the mass school shootings following Columbine will have the same signatures, such as families involved in the military-industrial complex, prescribed SSRIs and other psychotropic drugs, psychological care provided by the state, And associations with law enforcement prior to the shootings.
[01:34:03.181 --> 01:34:10.785]  Just like we saw with the retired federal agent in regular communication with the Buffalo gunman in a private Discord chat room.
[01:34:11.585 --> 01:34:18.509]  And in the recent Texas school shooting, how is the perpetrator able to afford nearly $5,000 of weaponry?
[01:34:19.389 --> 01:34:22.911]  And why did the police stand down while children were slaughtered?
[01:34:24.204 --> 01:34:26.688]  We are still allowed to question these things.
[01:34:27.228 --> 01:34:28.090]  But for how long?
[01:34:28.811 --> 01:34:32.295]  This evil will never stop until the truth is exposed.
[01:34:32.756 --> 01:34:37.603]  And unfortunately, most of us are too emotional to see things as they really are.
[01:34:38.503 --> 01:34:40.983]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reis.
[01:34:40.983 --> 01:34:53.783]  [Music]
[01:34:53.783 --> 01:34:56.583]  We are not living in a boring world.
[01:34:56.651 --> 01:34:58.573]  We are living in the middle of adventure.
[01:34:58.693 --> 01:35:00.334]  That is for sure.
[01:35:01.475 --> 01:35:06.779]  And incredible things are happening to try to block the destiny of humanity into the future.
[01:35:08.681 --> 01:35:09.481]  Let that sink in.
[01:35:11.303 --> 01:35:14.345]  Let's just race through phone calls this hour.
[01:35:14.445 --> 01:35:15.326]  Call after call.
[01:35:15.987 --> 01:35:18.288]  Let's go ahead and talk to Anonymous in California.
[01:35:18.769 --> 01:35:19.770]  Anonymous, you're on the air.
[01:35:19.810 --> 01:35:20.130]  Welcome.
[01:35:21.488 --> 01:35:24.150]  Hey Alex, long time listener, first time caller.
[01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:26.311]  Real quick, I'll try to be quick.
[01:35:27.151 --> 01:35:28.372]  I work in the pest control industry.
[01:35:29.793 --> 01:35:35.936]  It's another method that Bill Gates is using to get to us.
[01:35:36.076 --> 01:35:45.762]  There's a product that's being used, now we know he's responsible for genetically modified mosquitoes and those being released, especially out here in California.
[01:35:46.422 --> 01:35:48.423]  Well, there's a new product called N2Care.
[01:35:50.686 --> 01:35:52.167]  Uh, it's an end-to-care system.
[01:35:52.628 --> 01:36:01.576]  It uses mosquitoes to spread the pesticide and infect bodies of water all around.
[01:36:01.596 --> 01:36:14.046]  Um, I don't know if it's something you guys, uh, heard about or... And I have specifically heard about that.
[01:36:14.086 --> 01:36:14.547]  Elaborate.
[01:36:16.208 --> 01:36:17.129]  Well, um...
[01:36:18.789 --> 01:36:31.952]  I mean, it's just another way that, you know, his name, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, is an entity that funds this system.
[01:36:35.954 --> 01:36:40.075]  I was surprised to even see their name on the screen when I was at this seminar.
[01:36:41.455 --> 01:36:47.547]   But it just shows, once again, he's out to, you know, He's obsessed with releasing GMO mosquitoes.
[01:36:47.567 --> 01:36:48.907]  They're obsessed with GMO fish.
[01:36:48.947 --> 01:36:54.209]  It's basically a genetic takeover of the entire planet.
[01:36:54.029 --> 01:36:56.029]  on the pest control side.
[01:36:56.029 --> 01:37:02.269]   He's obsessed with releasing GMO mosquitoes, they're obsessed with GMO fish.
[01:37:02.269 --> 01:37:05.708]  It's basically a genetic takeover of the entire planet.
[01:37:05.708 --> 01:37:17.429]   Yeah, and it's being promoted as a safe, green use item, but the ingredient in it is pyrite proxiphen,
[01:37:17.429 --> 01:37:22.269]   which is a juvenile hormone analog and an intake growth regulator.
[01:37:22.269 --> 01:37:25.977]   *fart* And start that over again for listeners that just tuned in.
[01:37:26.458 --> 01:37:28.359]  What were you at a seminar for?
[01:37:28.419 --> 01:37:29.080]  What did they say?
[01:37:30.721 --> 01:37:35.464]  It was for pest control, residential, commercial pest control.
[01:37:37.285 --> 01:37:46.016]   It was just continuing education and what they were promoting and the main product they were promoting is this into care system and
[01:37:46.016 --> 01:37:52.695]   What it does is it uses mosquitoes to spread this chemical I
[01:37:52.695 --> 01:37:58.025]   I write proxy Which is a juvenile hormone analog and a insect growth
[01:37:58.025 --> 01:38:03.016]   regulator. Yep Because the because the mosquito is a natural
[01:38:03.016 --> 01:38:16.951]   vaccinator So they can program whatever they want and the mosquito then injects a large part of its liquid body into you through the proboscis to then liquefy blood to suck it back up.
[01:38:17.411 --> 01:38:20.452]  But instead, it delivers the payload when that happens.
[01:38:20.472 --> 01:38:21.632]  That's mainline news.
[01:38:22.092 --> 01:38:22.713]  That's happening.
[01:38:22.733 --> 01:38:23.433]  You're absolutely right.
[01:38:23.473 --> 01:38:24.193]  I'm glad you brought it up.
[01:38:25.253 --> 01:38:29.254]  Well Alex, it's not even the mosquito that's giving it to you through its injection.
[01:38:29.733 --> 01:38:31.676]  It's actually using its body.
[01:38:31.716 --> 01:38:34.980]  The chemical attracts to its own body, kind of like static electricity.
[01:38:35.541 --> 01:38:44.172]  And when it touches bodies of water, a swimming pool, a pond, a bucket of water, it now infects that body of water with that chemical.
[01:38:44.753 --> 01:38:45.714]  Send me info on that.
[01:38:45.794 --> 01:38:52.978]  I mean, look, there's a total genetic engineering revolution taking place right now, and that's what this whole broadcast is about.
[01:38:53.398 --> 01:38:54.179]  God bless you, sir.
[01:38:54.979 --> 01:38:55.779]  Send us information.
[01:38:55.819 --> 01:38:56.980]  Yeah, the sky's the limit.
[01:38:58.041 --> 01:39:00.582]  Let's talk to Queen in Tennessee.
[01:39:00.602 --> 01:39:01.163]  You're on the air.
[01:39:01.183 --> 01:39:01.543]  Go ahead.
[01:39:01.563 --> 01:39:03.804]  Hey, Alex.
[01:39:04.124 --> 01:39:05.445]  Hey.
[01:39:05.845 --> 01:39:13.950]  I've got a book that I recently obtained after surviving multiple trauma-based mind control rituals.
[01:39:14.651 --> 01:39:24.377]  On Good Friday of this year, I got a book called International Business Machine Corporation Data Processing Division, The Adventure of Tomorrow.
[01:39:25.758 --> 01:39:28.961]  And this book tells their game plan.
[01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:39.768]  And it basically also talks about, you know, using game theory and simulations.
[01:39:39.828 --> 01:39:40.348]  This book's from 1979.
[01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:45.031]  And it basically talks about wargaming the future.
[01:39:45.051 --> 01:39:54.055]  It talks about using cheap and widely available war weapons, possibly new and simple methods for lethal biological chemical warfare.
[01:39:54.135 --> 01:39:55.976]  Drops and storms can be used as weapons.
[01:39:56.636 --> 01:40:06.080]  This is all in a timeline that they've created with the International Business Machines Corporation back in 1979.
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:08.301]  This book doesn't even have an ISBN.
[01:40:10.319 --> 01:40:11.840]  Well, please mail us a copy of it.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:19.706]  You know, IBM is at the center of the spider's web of creating Bill Gates and Microsoft and Hitler before that.
[01:40:19.826 --> 01:40:20.206]  Everything.
[01:40:22.808 --> 01:40:37.399]  Yeah, I believe using the X2 that you have with the combination of the bodies and liquid nano gold helps to fortify our personal biosphere or creating a firewall against their chemical attacks.
[01:40:38.353 --> 01:40:47.418]  Well, there's no doubt God gave us compounds to counter all this, but yeah, if you look at IBM and everything it's done, it's at the very heart of the eugenics of the New World Order.
[01:40:47.738 --> 01:40:48.838]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:40:48.858 --> 01:40:50.979]  All right, moving quickly here to get to everybody.
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:54.501]  Let's go ahead and the order they are received.
[01:40:55.182 --> 01:40:57.263]  Let's talk to Tristan in North Dakota.
[01:40:57.283 --> 01:40:57.943]  Tristan, welcome.
[01:40:59.624 --> 01:41:00.784]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:41:01.365 --> 01:41:01.705]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:01.745 --> 01:41:02.545]  Longtime listener.
[01:41:02.785 --> 01:41:06.988]  Been listening since the Obama administration, the first one.
[01:41:08.254 --> 01:41:22.590]  Blue t-shirt, there's poison in the tap water, um, recently bought a TDS meter and just been testing around town, the place that I live, and turns out that, uh, there's a total of like six to seven hundred parts per million of dissolvable solids in the...
[01:41:23.374 --> 01:41:26.957]  In the water here, so that's well above the EPA's standard.
[01:41:27.077 --> 01:41:46.871]   But the thing I was going to touch on was a subject that one of your previous callers had brought up, just the alkalization of the soil, like turning it alkali, and then you've got big companies like Monsanto that have patented Yes, the FDA said no review.
[01:41:47.391 --> 01:41:53.310]   the change in the pH levels in the soil. So, you know, I also feel like it's a multi-angled attack,
[01:41:53.310 --> 01:42:00.591]   not just on like our genetics and everything through poisoning us with the aluminum. But,
[01:42:00.591 --> 01:42:04.910]   I mean, there could also be, there was something that you talked about months ago,
[01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:08.590]  something along the lines of like bioaccumulating nanoparticles.
[01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:13.791]   Yes, the FDA said no review. They're putting nanoparticles in a lot of the food now.
[01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:20.190]   Yeah, yeah. And then you were saying that there was some that could be sprayed that actually fall
[01:42:20.190 --> 01:42:25.951]   through the less dense skin layer, but are picked up by the higher density of your blood moving
[01:42:25.951 --> 01:42:31.070]   through your vessels. And then it could actually be carried to the blood brain barrier.
[01:42:31.226 --> 01:42:33.989]  Yeah, nanovirus penetrating particles, yeah.
[01:42:35.129 --> 01:42:53.889]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, so watching just one of those shows on Bandai Video talking about the Rwanda massacre and Just different aspects of how different particles that may be being sprayed could be activated via different frequencies in order to disrupt your cognitive abilities.
[01:42:53.989 --> 01:42:55.290]  I mean, it's wild.
[01:42:55.310 --> 01:42:58.693]  This is a globalist covert war that we're now in the middle of.
[01:42:58.733 --> 01:42:59.414]  You're absolutely right.
[01:42:59.474 --> 01:43:00.215]  It's been launched.
[01:43:01.095 --> 01:43:02.196]  It's happening at every level.
[01:43:02.296 --> 01:43:02.777]  We're here.
[01:43:02.897 --> 01:43:04.598]  We are inside of it now.
[01:43:05.199 --> 01:43:06.540]  That's why it's so surreal, brother.
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:08.522]  Isn't it crazy to be alive during this?
[01:43:09.793 --> 01:43:10.353]  Yeah, it is.
[01:43:10.573 --> 01:43:14.054]  And you coined the term clown world, and it rings more true every day.
[01:43:14.154 --> 01:43:17.455]  I forget my clown shoes and my clown nose, but we're really living it, aren't we?
[01:43:18.856 --> 01:43:19.356]  We are, brother.
[01:43:19.396 --> 01:43:20.236]  God bless you, Tristan.
[01:43:20.756 --> 01:43:25.838]  All right, Angelo, Richard, Patricia, Ken, John, Glenn, your calls and more, 877-789-2539.
[01:43:25.858 --> 01:43:25.898]  877-789-2539.
[01:43:25.918 --> 01:43:27.879]  It's the Alex Jones Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:27.699 --> 01:43:35.659]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:35.659 --> 01:43:39.378]   Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back with more calls straight ahead.
[01:43:39.378 --> 01:43:41.579]  It really is an incredible time to be alive.
[01:43:41.579 --> 01:43:42.919]  (laughs)
[01:43:43.039 --> 01:43:51.941]  To be living on this planet, all the globalists have put in their technocracy, and as soon as they had the AI in place, they launched their civilization collapsing event.
[01:43:52.361 --> 01:43:53.441]  They're at war with us.
[01:43:55.121 --> 01:43:55.761]  And it's happening.
[01:43:55.781 --> 01:43:57.942]  All right, let's go to the callers.
[01:43:58.082 --> 01:43:59.942]  In the order, again, they were received.
[01:44:00.402 --> 01:44:04.043]  Let's talk to Angelo in California.
[01:44:04.123 --> 01:44:04.843]  Angelo, welcome.
[01:44:06.504 --> 01:44:06.824]  Thank you.
[01:44:09.139 --> 01:44:13.583]  Morons are spraying it on themselves as well.
[01:44:14.423 --> 01:44:15.945]  It's so crazy.
[01:44:16.125 --> 01:44:18.787]  I mean, these ignominious POSs.
[01:44:20.048 --> 01:44:22.350]  It's just, it's unreal.
[01:44:22.870 --> 01:44:27.154]  Well, that's because they're taking orders from the spirit that controls them to kill us.
[01:44:27.234 --> 01:44:33.519]  And they believe they have processes to heal themselves, but they believe they're part of a transformation, a mutation.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:37.022]  Yes, they definitely have the tech.
[01:44:37.808 --> 01:44:45.015]  I mean, when David Adair... David Adair was the guy who tried to back up our power grid and got rejected three times.
[01:44:45.855 --> 01:44:52.301]  When he was 17, they took him down to Groom Lake, which is Area 51, and it was 1971.
[01:44:52.341 --> 01:45:02.911]  And he went in and there was this big iris, and the guy went over and he put his hands on a pad, and he put his eyes in this thing and there was a flash.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:12.125]  So they had a retina scanner and a palm scanner in 1971 and we didn't even have calculators at that time.
[01:45:12.145 --> 01:45:14.327]  Exactly.
[01:45:14.367 --> 01:45:14.587]  Yeah.
[01:45:14.687 --> 01:45:18.349]  Now they're, they were probably 20, 30 years ahead then.
[01:45:18.369 --> 01:45:21.891]  They're probably about a thousand years ahead now.
[01:45:21.911 --> 01:45:27.415]  I mean, they've got, they've got, it's like, there's two different worlds.
[01:45:28.055 --> 01:45:31.037]  We've got this world on the surface, which they're destroying.
[01:45:32.071 --> 01:45:36.195]  And then they've got the underground bases, 350 of them at least.
[01:45:36.235 --> 01:45:36.635]  That's right.
[01:45:36.695 --> 01:45:42.079]  The breakaway scientific dictatorship is absorbing the old world and building its new one.
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:43.761]  That's what the Davos Group says.
[01:45:45.162 --> 01:45:45.462]  Yep.
[01:45:46.003 --> 01:45:46.283]  Yep.
[01:45:47.384 --> 01:45:49.986]  Two different worlds and we're not part of it.
[01:45:50.206 --> 01:45:51.487]  There's no room for us.
[01:45:52.668 --> 01:45:54.850]  And it's crazy.
[01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:56.111]  I mean, it's sad.
[01:45:56.912 --> 01:46:04.868]   You know, I really like the While I track what these guys are doing, I'd really like to, you know, see some of this stuff firsthand.
[01:46:06.249 --> 01:46:18.191]  Well, it's a breakaway civilization, and it's the ultimate form of greed, the ultimate form of class, that they are the scientific elite that stole our ideas, and now they've separated us.
[01:46:18.671 --> 01:46:19.311]  It's incredible.
[01:46:19.411 --> 01:46:20.752]  Thank you so much for the call, Angelo.
[01:46:20.772 --> 01:46:21.412]  Amazing caller.
[01:46:21.772 --> 01:46:23.052]  All these calls have been amazing today.
[01:46:23.632 --> 01:46:26.173]  Let's talk to another caller who's been on the longest now.
[01:46:27.318 --> 01:46:32.003]  That would be Ken in Illinois.
[01:46:32.043 --> 01:46:32.824]  You're on the air, Ken.
[01:46:32.844 --> 01:46:35.046]  Hey, Alex.
[01:46:35.066 --> 01:46:35.967]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:46:35.987 --> 01:46:38.931]  I appreciate everything that you've been doing and your amazing crew.
[01:46:38.951 --> 01:46:46.163]   I especially love when they put together You sing in opera, I think you should use that voice more often.
[01:46:46.543 --> 01:46:50.866]  We'll come into the next segment with somebody with the meme of me singing opera.
[01:46:50.966 --> 01:46:51.586]  Okay, we'll do that.
[01:46:52.087 --> 01:46:59.032]  Also, have you ever played the Klaus Schwab promos where I hijack the World Economic Forum, it's satire, and then Klaus Schwab takes my show.
[01:46:59.052 --> 01:46:59.912]  We'll play those coming up.
[01:47:01.433 --> 01:47:03.735]  Yeah, is it Karl, Klau, Klaus?
[01:47:04.656 --> 01:47:05.136]  It's Klaus.
[01:47:05.156 --> 01:47:05.937]  Klaus Schwab.
[01:47:05.957 --> 01:47:07.698]  Okay.
[01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:10.271]  So I've got a question and then a request.
[01:47:10.291 --> 01:47:15.313]  My first question is, where is our Air Force, our Air National Guard, with these flyovers?
[01:47:15.413 --> 01:47:16.474]  I mean, we're being attacked.
[01:47:16.874 --> 01:47:26.598]  I almost believe that for everyone to really have their eyes open to know that this is for real is to break down one of these things and go, hey, what is this plane?
[01:47:26.959 --> 01:47:27.939]  What's it got on board?
[01:47:27.959 --> 01:47:34.302]  I mean, they're able to scramble jets for us being invaded.
[01:47:34.502 --> 01:47:35.242]  We're being invaded.
[01:47:35.263 --> 01:47:36.143]  So where are they at?
[01:47:38.237 --> 01:47:44.499]  Well, you know, Ken, you go back to the same place every other human does, and I'm a human too, where you want to individually challenge it.
[01:47:44.819 --> 01:47:50.640]  I showed you the documents, the treaties, the admissions that they're doing it through a global operation.
[01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:52.941]  So where's Congress?
[01:47:53.541 --> 01:47:56.201]  Instead of debating whether it exists, they admit they're doing it.
[01:47:56.602 --> 01:47:57.242]  It's toxic.
[01:47:57.282 --> 01:47:58.802]  They're spraying pesticides on us.
[01:47:59.242 --> 01:48:00.462]  I showed the documents earlier.
[01:48:00.522 --> 01:48:01.383]  What do we do about that?
[01:48:03.263 --> 01:48:10.882]   Right, but it shouldn't take an act of Congress for our own Air Force, Air National Guard to be protecting us and at our job.
[01:48:10.902 --> 01:48:18.113]  If there's a plane up there that is not identified, that they should be trying to identify, right?
[01:48:18.133 --> 01:48:20.477]  You understand, they're putting it in the jet fuel.
[01:48:21.018 --> 01:48:25.018]  A lot of folks call in and say, I've been on there 28 years.
[01:48:25.018 --> 01:48:27.018]  And for 25, we've been talking about chemtrails.
[01:48:27.018 --> 01:48:29.518]  And every caller, and I love you to death, is the same one.
[01:48:29.518 --> 01:48:31.018]  We need somebody to identify.
[01:48:31.018 --> 01:48:32.018]  We need somebody to know.
[01:48:32.018 --> 01:48:36.018]   I just showed you EU documents where they admit what they're spraying and what they're doing.
[01:48:36.018 --> 01:48:37.018]  It's an admitted program.
[01:48:37.018 --> 01:48:39.518]  But we never address it as that.
[01:48:39.518 --> 01:48:43.018]   We just address it as, oh, we've got to figure out what they're doing.
[01:48:43.018 --> 01:48:44.018]  Does that make sense?
[01:48:46.018 --> 01:48:51.018]  Yeah, I would just love to have action on it.
[01:48:51.018 --> 01:48:54.018]  Yeah, I understand what you're saying.
[01:48:54.450 --> 01:48:58.271]  But then I also want to get to my request.
[01:48:58.291 --> 01:49:22.144]   Whenever you guys are bringing up about the food prep plants catching fire, if you could also mention for us as listeners to reach out to our local food prep plants, such as just even, you know, if you're a hunter and you're taking your deer somewhere to get processed, Talk to them, let them know that they need to have some security going on so that they don't go up in flames because we don't know how far they're going to go.
[01:49:22.204 --> 01:49:29.626]  How are they going to go to that level of trying to get rid of us that you can go to where we're processing our deer meat.
[01:49:29.786 --> 01:49:33.047]  There's a total attack on all agriculture, all human activity.
[01:49:33.627 --> 01:49:34.628]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:49:35.608 --> 01:49:36.988]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:49:37.008 --> 01:49:38.489]  Let's talk to Richard in Tennessee.
[01:49:38.529 --> 01:49:39.009]  Go ahead, Richard.
[01:49:40.529 --> 01:49:41.450]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:49:42.111 --> 01:49:43.452]  Yeah, this is Richard in Tennessee.
[01:49:44.052 --> 01:49:45.694]  And first, I'd like to make a product plug.
[01:49:45.934 --> 01:49:47.896]  I did the liver cleanse years ago.
[01:49:47.916 --> 01:49:51.439]  I was experiencing diabetic symptoms, neuropathy, and sugar sweat.
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:54.162]  And both went away after I did the liver cleanse.
[01:49:54.382 --> 01:49:57.825]  They came back, I did another liver cleanse, and they went away again.
[01:49:58.506 --> 01:50:00.047]  So, I just thought that would help somebody.
[01:50:03.695 --> 01:50:05.235]  It's in the congressional budget.
[01:50:05.595 --> 01:50:12.877]  Stratospheric aerosols are listed on the same website that you had outed LE targets years ago.
[01:50:13.457 --> 01:50:24.159]  Stratospheric aerosols are being purchased on USAspending.gov or showing the purchasing and all the different, I guess, attached work orders or whatever they're under.
[01:50:24.519 --> 01:50:26.659]  But it goes back at least 10 years.
[01:50:27.499 --> 01:50:29.019]  And I just thought I'd give you a heads up.
[01:50:29.059 --> 01:50:32.360]  I think that would go viral, that type of information as well.
[01:50:33.072 --> 01:50:45.275]  No, you're totally right, and I'm glad you're down this alley, because it's admitted treaties, it's admitted operations, it's admitted programs, and I get the public's like, hey, trails didn't used to stay in the air, what's going on?
[01:50:45.615 --> 01:50:54.218]  But we have the documents, we should have a, how do we push to make Congress or governors or others say, hey, here's these documents, what are they spraying us with?
[01:50:54.278 --> 01:50:56.338]  The whole house of cards will fold at that point.
[01:50:57.479 --> 01:50:58.339]  Right, absolutely.
[01:50:59.315 --> 01:51:02.057]  The thing is, it's stratospheric aerosol.
[01:51:02.077 --> 01:51:06.379]  There's only one stratosphere and there are, in fact, aerosols up there now.
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:13.764]  I've noticed that it'll rain two to three days after they spray.
[01:51:13.784 --> 01:51:17.746]  I always think, what comes first, the rain or the chemtrails?
[01:51:19.147 --> 01:51:20.928]  I just really appreciate you.
[01:51:21.028 --> 01:51:23.270]  I actually put together a radio show here in town.
[01:51:23.670 --> 01:51:27.212]  You were on it for one episode with Elaine Davis.
[01:51:27.232 --> 01:51:28.353]  I don't know if you remember that or not.
[01:51:29.745 --> 01:51:35.772]  We were on for almost three years, and I think we had a very big impact, actually made some waves in the area.
[01:51:37.374 --> 01:51:42.300]  You changed my life, both health and political views, and I really appreciate you.
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:49.148]  Richard, I appreciate you, and I've done thousands of interviews, but I remember being on in Tennessee many times, so thank you so much, Richard.
[01:51:50.353 --> 01:51:50.973]  We're going to go to break.
[01:51:51.433 --> 01:51:52.354]  It's your chance to get on air.
[01:51:52.374 --> 01:51:53.354]  We love talking to you.
[01:51:53.834 --> 01:51:55.675]  The system hates people having free speech.
[01:51:56.075 --> 01:51:57.255]  We're about to do it straight ahead.
[01:51:57.315 --> 01:52:02.217]  More phone calls from Matt, TJ, James, Glenn, James, Patricia, John.
[01:52:02.257 --> 01:52:04.417]  Your calls all straight ahead.
[01:52:05.418 --> 01:52:07.818]  And we'll take that first hour today that was so powerful.
[01:52:08.198 --> 01:52:09.859]  We'll archive that at Band.Video.
[01:52:09.899 --> 01:52:10.699]  Please help share that.
[01:52:10.719 --> 01:52:11.299]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:12.099 --> 01:52:13.340]  All right, I'm not going to belabor this.
[01:52:14.790 --> 01:52:15.591]  We need funds.
[01:52:15.851 --> 01:52:17.252]  You need stuff to wake people up.
[01:52:17.952 --> 01:52:22.435]  Everybody should own one on their shelf so they can't censor you or stop you.
[01:52:23.215 --> 01:52:26.958]  Proof the 2020 election was stolen.
[01:52:26.978 --> 01:52:28.058]  2,000 mules.

[01:52:49.860 --> 01:52:51.480]  Very important documentary.

[01:52:54.561 --> 01:52:55.902]  Proving election fraud.
[01:52:56.322 --> 01:52:59.603]  You need the hard copy of 2000 Mules.

[01:53:34.770 --> 01:53:38.971]  Double Patriot points at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:53:39.824 --> 01:53:41.385]  All right, they hate us being on air.
[01:53:41.445 --> 01:53:42.766]  They hate us on hundreds of stations.
[01:53:42.806 --> 01:53:44.768]  They hate us reaching millions online.
[01:53:44.808 --> 01:53:48.130]  They hate the fact that we're not backing down and rolling over and dying.
[01:53:50.031 --> 01:53:51.492]  And the fact that we've got God on our side.
[01:53:52.553 --> 01:53:59.057]  So now we're taking your phone calls in the order that these great phone calls have been received.
[01:54:00.198 --> 01:54:04.461]  So let's go ahead and talk to Patricia in the great state of Texas.
[01:54:04.481 --> 01:54:05.402]  Patricia, you're on the air.
[01:54:06.742 --> 01:54:07.462]  Hi Alex!
[01:54:07.642 --> 01:54:15.424]  I was just going to let you know, talking about the Chemtrails, there are two products that are wonderful that will help and I recommend.
[01:54:15.564 --> 01:54:18.764]  BodEase, the turmeric, and Lung Cleanser.
[01:54:18.784 --> 01:54:23.505]  Because I know turmeric helps with your sinuses.
[01:54:24.006 --> 01:54:36.228]  But I also was going to let you know that I noticed that during COVID, when they would spray very heavily in our skies, that the very next day or several days, the COVID numbers would go sky high.
[01:54:37.065 --> 01:54:40.046]  So I don't know if there was any connection to that.
[01:54:40.066 --> 01:54:45.907]  Oh yeah, there's a Pentagon document, a London Telegraph, that they are spraying nanotech COVID in the air.
[01:54:46.327 --> 01:54:54.329]  And I gave you the EU and the UN and the official Spanish government saying they're spraying pesticides on you.
[01:54:55.029 --> 01:54:55.669]  In the chemtrails.
[01:54:56.829 --> 01:54:57.989]  Yes, I believe that.
[01:54:58.009 --> 01:55:02.650]  Because, like I said, the COVID numbers would skyrocket when that would happen.
[01:55:03.190 --> 01:55:15.726]   And then also, I want to do a shout out to Mike Morales on YouTube, he talks about this and he shows that they're also doing it in our oceans and they use bunker fuel.
[01:55:16.346 --> 01:55:31.939]  And when you go to Wikipedia, it tells you that under the health impact prior to 2020, that it would cause 400,000 premature deaths and 14 million childhood asthma cases each year.
[01:55:32.697 --> 01:55:44.882]  But after 2020, they introduced cleaner fuel, but still have around 250,000 deaths and 6.4 million childhood asthma cases each year.
[01:55:44.902 --> 01:55:47.223]  Well, the novelists are playing God.
[01:55:47.243 --> 01:55:48.164]  There's no doubt about that.
[01:55:49.144 --> 01:55:51.165]  Yes, I agree with you 100%.
[01:55:52.405 --> 01:55:55.146]  And I just want to thank you for all your products.
[01:55:55.267 --> 01:55:58.388]  But I wanted to plug those two because they really do help.
[01:55:59.028 --> 01:56:13.450]   And I pray through our Father God, That he will bless you in your righteous endeavors through Jesus Christ, and that you will be overwhelmed, your cup will overflow with the money you need to fight these people.
[01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:16.252]  Well, Patricia, thank you so much.
[01:56:16.292 --> 01:56:21.295]  We're definitely in a fight with the globalists, so there's nowhere better to support than here, point blank.
[01:56:21.735 --> 01:56:22.856]  I wish that wasn't even the case.
[01:56:22.876 --> 01:56:24.357]  It's pretty scary that we're the best there is.
[01:56:24.978 --> 01:56:26.899]  All right, let's talk to Glenn in Missouri.
[01:56:26.939 --> 01:56:27.700]  Glenn, go ahead.
[01:56:29.061 --> 01:56:29.661]  Hey, Alex.
[01:56:29.681 --> 01:56:30.202]  How you doing?
[01:56:31.826 --> 01:56:34.708]  Hey, listen, just first of all, you know, don't take it personal.
[01:56:34.728 --> 01:56:37.189]  I hate the new format, but that's just me.
[01:56:37.229 --> 01:56:37.929]  I hate change.
[01:56:38.650 --> 01:56:40.931]  So don't take it personal.
[01:56:41.031 --> 01:56:42.072]  What is the new format?
[01:56:42.172 --> 01:56:50.936]  Well, just, you know, the new, you know, just how you're, the show that I'm, you know, watching on the internet there.
[01:56:51.857 --> 01:56:52.557]  But I love it.
[01:56:52.817 --> 01:56:57.590]   I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I just like... Well, let me stop you, because I'm dumb.
[01:56:57.711 --> 01:56:58.131]  I'm dumb.
[01:56:58.371 --> 01:56:59.211]  I'm dumb, Glenn.
[01:57:00.112 --> 01:57:06.635]  This is the same show that's been in this syndicated format 25 years in this time slot, and I've not changed anything.
[01:57:06.676 --> 01:57:08.657]  I just cover the news and take calls and have guests on.
[01:57:09.677 --> 01:57:11.158]  You hate the new format, but you love it.
[01:57:11.438 --> 01:57:12.339]  What is the new format?
[01:57:13.159 --> 01:57:15.881]  Well, just, you know, just, you know, I don't know.
[01:57:16.201 --> 01:57:20.883]  The little changes, I just, you know... But anyway, I'm a big supporter.
[01:57:20.943 --> 01:57:21.684]  I got the coins.
[01:57:21.884 --> 01:57:23.645]  I missed the first one, but I got the last two.
[01:57:24.383 --> 01:57:25.163]  God bless you.
[01:57:26.003 --> 01:57:31.585]  You know, we're still, this country is still a law-abiding, you know, Constitution.
[01:57:31.605 --> 01:57:36.586]  You know, we are a country of laws.
[01:57:36.686 --> 01:57:37.426]  We've got the U.S.
[01:57:37.466 --> 01:57:40.866]  Constitution under our belt, and we've got to stick with that.
[01:57:41.927 --> 01:57:44.847]  You know, we've got to find these people and put them in jail.
[01:57:45.247 --> 01:57:45.627]  That's all.
[01:57:46.708 --> 01:57:48.968]  It's okay to lock up the bad guy, isn't it?
[01:57:48.988 --> 01:57:51.809]  Hey, I'm not arguing with you, brother.
[01:57:51.829 --> 01:57:52.709]  I appreciate your call.
[01:57:53.807 --> 01:57:54.648]  I don't know what to say.
[01:57:54.668 --> 01:57:55.789]  I don't know what to say to you, brother.
[01:57:55.909 --> 01:57:56.830]  I don't know what to say.
[01:57:56.690 --> 01:58:01.449]   change I will tell you I mean I can't sit here and lie to people about where
[01:58:01.449 --> 01:58:09.369]   we are and now it's all out in the open and I mean it's surreal for me as I've
[01:58:09.369 --> 01:58:15.650]   said to sit here and watch this all unfold I don't know what to say I just
[01:58:15.650 --> 01:58:19.650]   I don't know what to say to you brother I don't know what to say thank you Glenn
[01:58:19.650 --> 01:58:23.619]   let's go ahead and talk to another caller Let's talk to John in Florida.
[01:58:24.099 --> 01:58:24.840]  John, you're on the air.
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:25.220]  Go ahead.
[01:58:26.861 --> 01:58:27.962]  What's up, Alex Jones?
[01:58:28.723 --> 01:58:29.924]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:58:30.104 --> 01:58:31.725]  I want to talk about the chemtrails real quick.
[01:58:33.326 --> 01:58:40.592]  These things have been going on for a long time, and they're bombarding us with whatever they want, whatever they want to put in those things.
[01:58:40.612 --> 01:58:45.496]  They could do it with aluminum and borium one day, they could do it with corona the next, they could do it with whatever they want.
[01:58:45.876 --> 01:58:52.190]   I think they use When they have waste by-products and they can't get rid of them, where do they dump them?
[01:58:52.510 --> 01:58:53.311]  Right on top of us.
[01:58:57.174 --> 01:59:00.016]  In the old days, people just dumped stuff in the river, now they dump it right on them.
[01:59:00.056 --> 01:59:01.017]  They admit that, actually.
[01:59:01.457 --> 01:59:08.682]  In State Department Random 200 by Henry Kissinger, State Department Random 200, he says just dump the toxic waste right in their food.
[01:59:09.743 --> 01:59:10.444]  Exactly.
[01:59:10.544 --> 01:59:14.487]  And it's not a conspiracy theory when they admit to it, it's a conspiracy fact.
[01:59:17.039 --> 01:59:22.023]  Well, that's my great frustration, is that this stuff is just right out in the open.
[01:59:22.864 --> 01:59:23.624]  Right out in the open.
[01:59:23.885 --> 01:59:24.825]  What do we do about it, John?
[01:59:25.946 --> 01:59:35.914]  I think what I've been doing is, a couple years back, actually over a decade back, I got in an argument with an officer out of the Air Force, up there by Cape Canaveral.
[01:59:36.395 --> 01:59:38.176]  And he told me about the chemtrails.
[01:59:38.737 --> 01:59:39.237]  Prove it.
[01:59:40.078 --> 01:59:45.122]  And I told him, it's not hard to prove something that you can see with your own eyes.
[01:59:45.976 --> 01:59:52.419]  And I've literally witnessed two different planes fly by perpendicular, one with a line and one without.
[01:59:52.659 --> 01:59:54.120]  One at 80,000 and one at 35,000.
[01:59:55.841 --> 01:59:57.602]  One has people on it, one does not.
[01:59:59.303 --> 01:59:59.983]  This is simple.
[02:00:03.883 --> 02:00:15.770]  I agree with what you're saying, but you understand we show the first hour, mainstream news, CBS, ABC News, Council on Foreign Relations, UN documents, Spanish government documents, EU documents, admitting it.
[02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:22.433]  So, I've done hundreds of shows on this, and literally, almost no one cares about the documents.
[02:00:22.453 --> 02:00:26.536]  Like, we keep having a debate about, look, it's happening, they admit they're doing it.
[02:00:27.156 --> 02:00:28.176]  It's like world government.
[02:00:28.416 --> 02:00:34.179]  Klaus Schwab says, we rule the earth, we're gonna have a world ID, we're gonna control everything you do, we're gonna take everything away from you.
[02:00:34.199 --> 02:00:36.219]  It's like, is there really a world government?
[02:00:36.259 --> 02:00:37.160]  We still have a debate about it.
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:52.325]  All I know is, if you're in the military, or you're in the, you know, above the military, some kind of intelligence, and you're going along with this stuff, when it finally boils over, you better watch out.
[02:00:53.596 --> 02:00:53.996]  I agree.
[02:00:54.076 --> 02:00:59.397]  People pretending they're part of the power structure and are exempt from this are completely and totally insane.
[02:00:59.737 --> 02:01:00.397]  Thank you, John.
[02:01:00.457 --> 02:01:01.538]  Smartest thing said today.
[02:01:02.118 --> 02:01:02.438]  All right.
[02:01:02.978 --> 02:01:10.179]  Coming up next segment, James, Matt, Greg, Emanuel, and others ahead of the guest host in the fourth hour.
[02:01:10.279 --> 02:01:14.440]  Then, as we fight back against tyranny, Owen Schroyer.
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:15.560]  3 p.m.
[02:01:15.620 --> 02:01:16.421]  Central today.
[02:01:16.841 --> 02:01:21.882]  The War Room at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:01:22.101 --> 02:01:23.101]  We'll be right back.
[02:01:23.101 --> 02:01:51.101]  [Music]
[02:01:52.101 --> 02:01:58.101]   It's a great pleasure to welcome the cyber attacks and starving Donald Trump.
[02:01:58.101 --> 02:01:59.101]  population.
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:14.619]   We do not yet know the full extent and the systemic and structural changes which will
[02:02:14.619 --> 02:02:15.620]  happen.
[02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:25.020]   However, we do know that global energy systems, food systems, and supply chains will be deeply
[02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:25.420]  affected.
[02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:26.420]  [cheering]
[02:02:26.683 --> 02:02:33.312]  In times of crisis, the role of governments is more important and more relevant than ever.
[02:02:35.581 --> 02:02:46.876]  What is also needed is a summit like this one to go beyond crisis management and to look into constructive ways we can build our common future.
[02:02:47.838 --> 02:03:08.169]   In conclusion, and despite all the challenges, We have to uphold our responsibility, which we have towards the next generation, and which we can only fulfill through collaboration on a national and on a global level.
[02:03:10.291 --> 02:03:17.897]  All right, taking final phone calls ahead of the next guest host that's set to take over here today, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:03:21.932 --> 02:03:22.973]  And look, I want to say this.
[02:03:23.033 --> 02:03:29.257]  I was sitting there during the break thinking, man, you're covering really depressing things, really scary things, but God's in control.
[02:03:30.037 --> 02:03:31.038]  And we have to give it to God.
[02:03:31.058 --> 02:03:32.159]  We have to believe in God.
[02:03:32.719 --> 02:03:35.041]  We have to understand that through God, we can transcend this.
[02:03:35.441 --> 02:03:36.362]  And this is a process.
[02:03:37.162 --> 02:03:38.263]  The globalists are not God.
[02:03:38.303 --> 02:03:39.484]  They can pretend to be God.
[02:03:39.984 --> 02:03:41.245]  They can play God all day.
[02:03:42.045 --> 02:03:44.967]  They can break the social contract, but they will fail in the end.
[02:03:45.848 --> 02:03:47.729]  So in order to receive, let's take calls.
[02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:49.931]  Let's talk to James and then Matt.
[02:03:50.031 --> 02:03:51.552]  James in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:03:56.499 --> 02:03:57.760]  All right, James, you busy?
[02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:01.264]  Hey, I love the Sergio Leone music.
[02:04:01.304 --> 02:04:01.824]  That was good.
[02:04:02.024 --> 02:04:03.306]  Go ahead.
[02:04:04.046 --> 02:04:05.448]  Hey, I had a question.
[02:04:05.848 --> 02:04:13.856]  I'm a young guy, born in 1995, so it's been kind of a mindfuck to discern what's going on in this reality.
[02:04:14.236 --> 02:04:15.077]  But you've been a great help.
[02:04:15.618 --> 02:04:18.020]  I had a question because, you know, I'm not a scientist.
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:19.101]  I can't research everything.
[02:04:19.648 --> 02:04:21.349]  But I can't do a bit.
[02:04:21.809 --> 02:04:25.510]  I came across a guy, Dr. Hardy Lineback.
[02:04:25.550 --> 02:04:30.652]  He's a long-term dentist, you know, doing it his whole life in Canada.
[02:04:31.232 --> 02:04:36.454]  He was like on the board of National Academies of Sciences, has over 100 publications in dentistry.
[02:04:36.474 --> 02:05:00.102]   They have reports and there's lots of literature on it about water fluoridation, how it's, you know, basically Not really helping tooth decay that much and that it poses several risks to brain development, fetus development, IQ, bone development, it's before it can build up in your system.
[02:05:00.983 --> 02:05:17.113]   Even though, you know, FDA has regulations where They started out in the 40s with the fluoride in the water, not calcium fluoride, but hydrofluorosilicic acid, and it eats your brain, annihilates fertility, massively causes cancer, absolutely.
[02:05:17.373 --> 02:05:18.634]  It's a well-known documented fact.
[02:05:20.055 --> 02:05:21.016]  Yeah, so that's going on.
[02:05:21.036 --> 02:05:25.539]  I'm sure there's other things in the water that probably is an entire dosage then.
[02:05:26.304 --> 02:05:28.005]  It all needs to be, if at all.
[02:05:28.025 --> 02:05:44.515]  So yeah, I kind of was thinking like, how did we get to this situation where America has been dumbed down so much that we're allowing sort of all these things to happen, allowing the oligarchs to call all the shots, people going along with it?
[02:05:44.635 --> 02:05:45.536]  Is this part of it?
[02:05:46.296 --> 02:05:48.298]  And how do we get our way out?
[02:05:48.338 --> 02:05:49.178]  Like, can we do it?
[02:05:49.278 --> 02:05:50.079]  Well, that's it, brother.
[02:05:50.159 --> 02:05:57.324]  I think the whole question of the last three hours is we have to awaken, we have to admit the facts, we have to become awake and say no to it.
[02:05:57.685 --> 02:05:58.745]  So I think you hit the nail on the head.
[02:05:58.765 --> 02:06:04.289]  Well, thanks for doing what you're doing.
[02:06:04.309 --> 02:06:05.330]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:06:05.590 --> 02:06:06.991]  Brother, we're in the same boat together.
[02:06:07.031 --> 02:06:07.912]  God bless you, James.
[02:06:08.553 --> 02:06:10.594]  All right, let's talk to Collar in Wisconsin.
[02:06:11.074 --> 02:06:12.495]  Let's talk to Matt in Wisconsin.
[02:06:12.515 --> 02:06:13.036]  Matt, go ahead.
[02:06:14.898 --> 02:06:27.220]  Hi Mr. Jones, you're my favorite ice cream flavor and I wanted to, you know, bring up how the globalists believe that we live in some sort of Wakanda society while forgetting the Waukesha aspects of it.
[02:06:27.500 --> 02:06:34.621]  And a lot of people forget with the chemtrails that the ground-based systems pump out more clouds.
[02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:42.560]   If you type in Jeremy Clarkson from Top Gear, NASA cloud on YouTube, you can see these so-called
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:45.860]  rocket testing facilities that NASA have.
[02:06:45.860 --> 02:06:49.640]  A hundred square miles around it is all for NASA.
[02:06:49.640 --> 02:06:53.079]  And they fill the atmosphere with clouds.
[02:06:53.079 --> 02:06:56.759]   And obviously it goes without saying it's a lot easier to provide the poisonous chemicals
[02:06:56.759 --> 02:06:59.161]  on the ground than doing it in the air.
[02:06:59.161 --> 02:07:03.960]   And another huge point, which is huge, Joe Rogan brought it up on Joe Rogan's show, is
[02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:08.460]   that the metal particulate is also like a triad multi-pronged attack where they can
[02:07:08.460 --> 02:07:14.480]   use it as an EMP to take down UFOs and enemy aircraft because the atmosphere itself becomes
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:17.081]  charged.
[02:07:17.081 --> 02:07:25.840]   And lastly, with water supply, I think with Europe, how America is being turned into Europe,
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:32.760]   I think comes from how Europe uses more bidets where they're boofing or getting anally the
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:36.840]   fluoride and chemicals because they have water going up their tuchus.
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:37.840]  All right.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:39.480]  Good, good joke there.
[02:07:39.429 --> 02:07:40.849]  All right, let's take another call here.
[02:07:41.349 --> 02:07:43.030]  Let's talk to Greg in Pennsylvania.
[02:07:43.070 --> 02:07:43.790]  Greg, you're on the air.
[02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:44.190]  Go ahead.
[02:07:46.171 --> 02:07:46.911]  Hi, Alex.
[02:07:46.951 --> 02:07:48.151]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:07:49.171 --> 02:07:53.692]  If I could, real quick, I wanted to plug X2 and bodies.
[02:07:54.173 --> 02:07:56.433]  I'm 61, going to be 62 this year.
[02:07:56.453 --> 02:08:02.074]  I was feeling pretty old, 53, 54 years old, getting up slow.
[02:08:02.635 --> 02:08:08.016]  I had that brain fog going on, and I started taking your supplements, and wow.
[02:08:09.655 --> 02:08:11.216]  Well, I can't live without them now.
[02:08:12.056 --> 02:08:13.537]  Truly great products.
[02:08:14.037 --> 02:08:15.157]  Well, elaborate on that.
[02:08:15.197 --> 02:08:17.278]  I mean, what InfoWars products did you take?
[02:08:17.298 --> 02:08:17.678]  What happened?
[02:08:18.778 --> 02:08:20.659]  Oh, I take the X2 every day.
[02:08:20.799 --> 02:08:22.800]  I have for probably six years.
[02:08:23.800 --> 02:08:26.321]  The bodies, I take every day.
[02:08:26.341 --> 02:08:29.202]  I missed the Real Red Pill.
[02:08:29.322 --> 02:08:30.643]  I took that every day.
[02:08:30.663 --> 02:08:34.424]  I use your Alpha Power.
[02:08:35.969 --> 02:08:55.036]  I just bought your Vitamin C product and I take the B12, the Ultra 12 and the Vitamin D. I take them all in the morning and in the evening and I sleep great.
[02:08:55.936 --> 02:08:57.096]  My pain is gone.
[02:08:57.176 --> 02:08:58.777]  My back doesn't hurt anymore.
[02:08:58.817 --> 02:09:05.064]   I don't get up and have to like stretch and I just don't have that anymore.
[02:09:05.124 --> 02:09:06.204]  I spring out of bed.
[02:09:06.224 --> 02:09:12.006]  It just took away so much of that pain and brain fog.
[02:09:12.346 --> 02:09:17.067]  The X2, I think, is really, really the super, super... Well, exactly.
[02:09:17.087 --> 02:09:25.310]  The UN estimates two plus million, two plus billion, excuse me, people have cognitive disabilities or lower IQ because of lack of iodine.
[02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:27.271]  They took iodine out of salt.
[02:09:28.351 --> 02:09:31.713]  The poison fluoride and chloride in the water that's the opposite.
[02:09:32.174 --> 02:09:33.614]  And that's why this is pure iodine.
[02:09:33.654 --> 02:09:34.335]  Nobody else has it.
[02:09:34.355 --> 02:09:36.857]  That's why X2 is so incredibly important.
[02:09:36.897 --> 02:09:39.498]  Everybody should experience X2 for themselves.
[02:09:39.538 --> 02:09:41.359]  Takes about two weeks to kick in.
[02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:43.161]  x2infowarsstore.com.
[02:09:43.701 --> 02:09:44.602]  What else is on your mind?
[02:09:45.722 --> 02:09:47.483]  Well, I give the X2 to my wife.
[02:09:47.583 --> 02:09:48.544]  I gave her a bottle.
[02:09:48.604 --> 02:09:51.246]  My beautiful wife, Valerie, she loves you.
[02:09:51.366 --> 02:09:52.787]  She's listened to you for years.
[02:09:53.307 --> 02:10:10.547]   And she talked about a lot of this stuff you talk about with the chemtrails and You know, this being an alien type, there's no other way to explain it, but a lot of our friends and stuff just think she's total nuts, but a lot of them now are seeing it.
[02:10:13.168 --> 02:10:15.429]  My wife is an incredible girl.
[02:10:16.289 --> 02:10:26.576]   She just has a different perspective on things, and it's a perspective, I think, that comes from deep Intelligence, I really do.
[02:10:26.656 --> 02:10:28.537]  She's a great person and a great woman.
[02:10:29.618 --> 02:11:16.923]   The thing that I caught about, though, Alex, was these leaders, so-called leaders that we see, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, George Soros, I believe, and I've been listening and paying attention to this for all of my adult life, I believe that these are like the regional managers of a corporate structure, and as ugly and as demonic as these people are, they work for somebody that has quadrillions of dollars, and these are the people that put all this stuff together, and these are the agents of evil
[02:11:17.950 --> 02:11:26.734]  But they work for a greater evil, and these demons are so ugly that you really couldn't even lay eyes on them.
[02:11:27.194 --> 02:11:31.956]  It's just incredible, this smorgasbord of crap that we're being fed.
[02:11:32.816 --> 02:11:38.478]  You know, the idea that a lie goes around the world before the truth puts its pants on.
[02:11:38.518 --> 02:11:43.140]  Well, they've launched thousands of lies, and we're trying to catch up with the truth.
[02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:44.621]  But God is on our side.
[02:11:44.661 --> 02:11:45.721]  Thank you so much, Craig.
[02:11:45.761 --> 02:11:46.542]  Amazing points.
[02:11:46.742 --> 02:11:47.082]  All right.
[02:11:48.064 --> 02:11:53.768]  Emmanuel, Turk, two final calls, then Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[02:11:54.228 --> 02:11:55.169]  We're back in two minutes.
[02:11:55.469 --> 02:11:58.908]   We'll take five minutes of calls straight ahead in the war room in one hour.
[02:11:58.908 --> 02:12:14.377]   I'm no stranger to the rain Alright, this is a short little segment.
[02:12:14.397 --> 02:12:16.738]  We're going to jam two calls in.
[02:12:16.838 --> 02:12:19.340]  And then Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.News takes over.
[02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:30.520]   I fought with the devil. I fought with the devil. Got down on his level. But I never gave in. So he gave it all.
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:36.510]   Alright, this is a short little segment. We're going to jam two calls in. And then Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.News
[02:12:36.510 --> 02:12:37.520]  takes over.
[02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:41.520]  Emmanuel in California, welcome.
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:43.520]  Can you hear me alright?
[02:12:43.639 --> 02:12:44.079]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:44.099 --> 02:12:45.640]  Nice to talk to you.
[02:12:46.621 --> 02:12:51.645]  About the chemtrails, there was a Fox 40 News report a few years back.
[02:12:51.665 --> 02:12:52.886]  It was out of Las Vegas.
[02:12:53.566 --> 02:13:02.833]  So if you type in Fox 40 News, Las Vegas, Nevada, they have a report that for the first time they were using drones to be used for cloud seeding.
[02:13:03.194 --> 02:13:08.237]  So they admitted that they were spraying in the atmosphere and they've been using planes since the 1960s.
[02:13:08.958 --> 02:13:12.741]  But the only reason they did the report was because they're bragging now they're using drones for it.
[02:13:13.442 --> 02:13:24.925]  And then they were talking about the chemicals in there, and one of the things I remember was they were saying there was a yellow organic compound, and the guy they were interviewing with that said he doesn't even know what it was.
[02:13:25.545 --> 02:13:28.246]  So they're spraying this stuff without even knowing what's in it.
[02:13:28.706 --> 02:13:29.207]  That's right.
[02:13:29.467 --> 02:13:31.207]  People say, oh, have the pilots expose it.
[02:13:32.387 --> 02:13:33.588]  They're told to spray it.
[02:13:33.908 --> 02:13:36.289]  That's why they admit there's these projects.
[02:13:36.709 --> 02:13:37.749]  That's what we've got to expose.
[02:13:38.217 --> 02:13:40.938]  Well, the government, it was the government admitting it.
[02:13:41.178 --> 02:13:44.778]  But the trick is, when you say chemtrails, it's a conspiracy.
[02:13:45.018 --> 02:13:46.619]  You have to use cloud seeding.
[02:13:46.659 --> 02:13:49.699]  That's the politically correct term for what they're doing.
[02:13:49.879 --> 02:13:51.079]  They're spraying this garbage.
[02:13:51.379 --> 02:13:52.400]  I'm sure it's got aluminum.
[02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:55.520]  And they treat it like animals, like, oh, it's not even going on.
[02:13:55.540 --> 02:13:56.280]  Don't even look at it.
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:01.561]  But, I mean, with aluminum barium, that stuff gets in the soil, it kills the microbes.
[02:14:02.381 --> 02:14:05.102]  So they're literally killing the soil when this stuff reaches the ground.
[02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:08.611]  So anyways, I was hoping maybe you can pull that up.
[02:14:08.631 --> 02:14:15.614]  I know you don't have time today, but if you can bring up that Fox News report, they have the video, they have video of the drone.
[02:14:15.634 --> 02:14:16.634]  It's on drones now.
[02:14:16.794 --> 02:14:17.334]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:14:17.554 --> 02:14:18.335]  Making it rain.
[02:14:18.355 --> 02:14:23.557]  Drones could be the future for cloud seeding Fox News five years ago.
[02:14:23.857 --> 02:14:24.277]  All right.
[02:14:24.777 --> 02:14:26.038]  Thank you so much, Emmanuel.
[02:14:26.298 --> 02:14:26.978]  Amazing points.
[02:14:26.998 --> 02:14:27.638]  Thanks for holding.
[02:14:28.219 --> 02:14:30.680]  Turk in the FEMA Region 9 last caller.
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:32.580]  The next phase of the InfoWar.
[02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:33.181]  Tell us about it.
[02:14:35.181 --> 02:14:36.302]  Hey, thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:14:36.877 --> 02:14:42.058]  Hey man, so I keep on hearing not only when people call into you, but everywhere.
[02:14:42.078 --> 02:14:46.559]  They just keep asking like, what can I do?
[02:14:47.159 --> 02:14:47.659]  What can I do?
[02:14:48.179 --> 02:14:51.340]  And Alex, I'm calling to get you an idea of what we can do.
[02:14:51.860 --> 02:14:56.380]  And it's time for people to step out of the metaverse and step into the arena.
[02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:00.901]  It's time to get people off the couch and have them step into the arena.
[02:15:01.261 --> 02:15:08.602]   And what we've developed is an organizing construct that can partner I've sent you your show tips.
[02:15:08.962 --> 02:15:10.262]  I've sent it to your advertising guys.
[02:15:10.322 --> 02:15:15.043]  We want to pay you, Alex, with an NFT project that is going to do this.
[02:15:15.263 --> 02:15:19.204]  It's an organizing construct that will do coalition building.
[02:15:19.504 --> 02:15:26.246]  We get in, we partnership with medical and legal advocates, then we start working with them to document research.
[02:15:26.546 --> 02:15:31.305]   The people will be tasked through this gamification of political action.
[02:15:31.706 --> 02:15:42.113]  And what they'll be able to do, Alex, is they'll be able to find, document, cite, and organize information on COVID-related crimes, criminals, and injuries.
[02:15:42.534 --> 02:15:44.295]  And then- Okay, is there an onsite?
[02:15:44.335 --> 02:15:45.416]  Where do I find out about this?
[02:15:46.138 --> 02:15:48.902]  This is called Step Into The Arena Game.

[02:15:51.886 --> 02:15:53.288]  Alex, put your people on it.
[02:15:53.528 --> 02:15:56.032]  We want to pay you hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[02:15:56.132 --> 02:15:59.597]  We can make this happen and to keep the info war running.
[02:15:59.857 --> 02:16:15.357]   But this is what it does is it's not just just You're right, people need a mission.
[02:16:15.477 --> 02:16:21.980]  Alright, Turk, I appreciate your call.
[02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:23.981]  I will check out that URL.
[02:16:24.261 --> 02:16:25.041]  Thank you so much.
[02:16:25.061 --> 02:16:31.044]  Alright, Paul Joseph Watson from the United Kingdom takes over in 60 seconds then.

[02:16:51.144 --> 02:17:17.314]   1776coin.com Transmitting worldwide from the summit dot news studios in
[02:17:17.314 --> 02:17:22.584]   the United Kingdom You are listening to Paul Joseph Watson
[02:17:22.584 --> 02:17:25.164]  (upbeat music)
[02:17:24.992 --> 02:17:31.976]  It is the Summit News Hour on this 2nd of June 2022 edition, Gay Pride Month!
[02:17:32.156 --> 02:17:39.020]  Because if there's ever a movement that hasn't attracted enough attention, it's the Gay Pride Movement, isn't it?
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:45.283]  They need more cultural establishment, endorsement and protection because they're just such an oppressed minority!
[02:17:45.964 --> 02:17:46.864]  We're going to get into that.
[02:17:47.205 --> 02:17:55.529]  We're also going to tell you what happened to the small village in Northern England, which the government suddenly announced with no consultation with them whatsoever.
[02:17:56.510 --> 02:18:00.572]  A village of 700 residents, one shop.
[02:18:01.172 --> 02:18:03.414]  It takes three weeks to get a doctor's appointment.
[02:18:04.014 --> 02:18:13.279]  The government suddenly told them, oh, we're going to dump 1,500 economic migrants, which they call refugees, in their village.
[02:18:13.891 --> 02:18:19.272]  At a disused RAF Air Force base, a stone's throw away from this village.
[02:18:20.192 --> 02:18:26.654]  Well, it's actually a good news story because they've protested against it and it's at least on temporary hold for now.
[02:18:27.494 --> 02:18:36.136]  But this is the agenda that our supposedly Conservative government has said will be applied across the entire country.
[02:18:36.776 --> 02:18:50.237]   Resettling refugees that they rescue via border force boats After they pay criminal people smugglers to jump on dinghies and small boats from France and wash up on UK shores.
[02:18:50.277 --> 02:18:51.798]  There's no deterrence whatsoever.
[02:18:52.418 --> 02:18:54.960]  There's a lot of incentivisation for them to get here.
[02:18:54.980 --> 02:18:56.300]  I don't even blame the migrants.
[02:18:56.380 --> 02:19:00.523]  If I came from some of those countries that they're coming from, I'd probably try to get here.
[02:19:01.003 --> 02:19:09.789]  But where full and diversity, as has now been proven by academic studies, peer-reviewed, is, no matter what they tell you, not a strength.
[02:19:10.612 --> 02:19:19.215]  I'm going to get into that in the next couple of segments though because I want to start with this gay pride stuff because, well they say life imitates art.
[02:19:19.816 --> 02:19:25.778]  Now life in this clown world that we live in is literally imitating memes!
[02:19:26.338 --> 02:19:47.021]   People joked online a few weeks ago that the virtue signaling progressives are so desperate to support countless concurrent myriad of current things That they would incorporate the Ukrainian flag into the LGBTQI blah blah blah cat on a keyboard flag.
[02:19:47.541 --> 02:19:49.763]  And yes, they have done it!
[02:19:50.663 --> 02:20:00.889]  Now what's interesting about this is Snopes came out about two days ago and said, oh there's a big fake conspiracy theory circulating that's false.
[02:20:01.710 --> 02:20:10.353]   That gay pride organizers are going to integrate the Ukraine flag into the, let's face it, already quite crowded LGBT rainbow flag.
[02:20:10.934 --> 02:20:13.796]  They said this is false, misleading, it's conspiracy theory.
[02:20:14.476 --> 02:20:16.378]  Lo and behold, today it happened.
[02:20:16.978 --> 02:20:22.322]  Gay pride parade organisers add Ukraine colours to LGBTQ flag.
[02:20:23.923 --> 02:20:28.146]  Presumably to ensure support for all current things are covered.
[02:20:29.087 --> 02:20:34.271]  And of course the result, as you can see on screen now, is another migraine-inducing, virtue-singling vomit of colours.
[02:20:35.273 --> 02:20:43.660]  This is Dublin LGBTQ Plus Pride, one of the principal organisers of the annual Gay Pride Parade in Ireland's capital city.
[02:20:44.281 --> 02:21:01.015]  Bear in mind that Dublin is so incredibly woke, left-wing and insufferable that it's already literally smothered in Ukraine flags from one side of the city to the other, outnumbering its own Irish flag by probably about 10 to 1 from what people have said online.
[02:21:02.958 --> 02:21:16.146]  But now the Dublin LGBTQ Plus Pride, which is one of the principal organisers of the annual Gay Pride Parade in Ireland's capital city, has decided to add the colours of the Ukrainian flag to the ever-evolving rainbow flag.
[02:21:16.186 --> 02:21:25.172]  Now remember, it started off as a rainbow flag, then they included trans, non-binary and all these other identities that they made up.
[02:21:26.193 --> 02:21:40.541]   Then they included, last month I believe it was, Sadiq Khan revealed a new flag which included A new colour to represent the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia, which he called Idahobbit.
[02:21:41.201 --> 02:21:46.405]  And they also included another colour, which was shocking pink, to represent women.
[02:21:47.666 --> 02:21:49.448]  God knows why, but they included that as well.
[02:21:49.908 --> 02:21:50.689]  That's not enough.
[02:21:50.749 --> 02:21:52.370]  There are not enough colours on this flag.
[02:21:52.791 --> 02:21:55.413]  Now they include the Ukraine flag too.
[02:21:56.454 --> 02:22:01.398]  Because of course, if they don't, then maybe they don't support Ukraine anymore.
[02:22:02.341 --> 02:22:07.462]  So yes, this is not a conspiracy theory, and I make that point because there's an article up on Snopes.
[02:22:08.943 --> 02:22:11.703]  Were Ukraine's colours added to Pride flag?
[02:22:12.403 --> 02:22:24.406]  Snopes, of course, absolutely renowned for publishing articles which claim things are fake based on obscure minutiae, when in actual fact the entire issue is genuine and true.
[02:22:26.567 --> 02:22:31.968]  And it says the colours of Ukraine's flag, blue and yellow, were added to a flag that's a symbol of LGBTQ pride.
[02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:33.000]  Rating?
[02:22:33.440 --> 02:22:34.000]  False!
[02:22:35.921 --> 02:22:49.145]  But then you'll note in the article they had to add later on that the Dublin LGBTQ plus Pride Festival did use a different version of a progress pride flag containing the Ukraine colours.
[02:22:49.805 --> 02:22:51.526]  So again, this is yet another example.
[02:22:51.606 --> 02:22:56.547]  Snopes, the headline says, were Ukraine colours added to the pride flag?
[02:22:57.304 --> 02:23:06.730]  The claim is rendered a hoax, false, and then in their own article they admit that it's not false, it's actually happening.
[02:23:08.310 --> 02:23:13.113]  And I'm looking at the website now, and there's a screenshot of it in the middle of the article.
[02:23:13.974 --> 02:23:27.457]   DublinPride.ie, and this is their Pride 2022 section, They've got the Ukraine flag right at the top, incorporated into this migraine-inducing, vomit-inducing, rainbow flag.
[02:23:27.797 --> 02:23:34.620]  This is one of the organisations organising the Gay Pride March in Dublin for this month.
[02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:45.126]  So, the actual fact-checkers, once again, in the course of fact-checking something and declaring it false, actually admit that it's true.
[02:23:46.126 --> 02:23:47.347]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:23:47.507 --> 02:24:02.293]   And again, They're literally fulfilling a meme that people joked about a few weeks ago when they said, hey, wouldn't it be funny if these people who are obsessed with flags, apart from on, you know, you fly the flag of your own country, that's horrible and racist and bigoted.
[02:24:02.453 --> 02:24:03.134]  You can't do that.
[02:24:03.154 --> 02:24:06.236]  You're a flag shagger, as they say here in the United Kingdom.
[02:24:06.934 --> 02:24:11.557]  But they will literally plant their flag in everything and add a million different colours to it.
[02:24:11.937 --> 02:24:22.563]  Wouldn't it be funny if those people are so desperate to signal their virtue that they took the already vastly overcrowded LGBT flag and put Ukraine colours on it?
[02:24:22.603 --> 02:24:23.723]  Wouldn't that be hilarious?
[02:24:23.823 --> 02:24:24.464]  Yeah, they did it!
[02:24:24.764 --> 02:24:25.944]  They actually did it!
[02:24:26.805 --> 02:24:29.767]  Snope said they didn't and admit in their own article that they did.
[02:24:30.527 --> 02:24:38.435]   Meanwhile, talking about life imitating memes, US Marines ridiculed over gay bullets tweet.
[02:24:39.216 --> 02:25:06.289]   You'll remember after the invasion of Ukraine, and in fact before that, and one of the examples is included in this article, all these memes were made when Biden got in about bombs being dropped from US military bombers under the auspices of a, you know, another deep state invasion into a Middle Eastern country, But the bombs were painted with the LGBTQ rainbow flag colours.
[02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:23.094]  And it was like, oh, obviously the point is the deep state, transnational corporations, cultural institutions, governments appropriate this gay pride movement, whatever its origins, it's now the establishment.
[02:25:23.474 --> 02:25:30.676]  So the very idea that they have to go on marches in major Western cities to proclaim their rights because they're so oppressed.
[02:25:31.403 --> 02:25:32.643]  is absolutely absurd.
[02:25:33.003 --> 02:25:38.925]  They're endorsed, supported and protected by every single organ of the establishment in existence.
[02:25:39.825 --> 02:25:53.449]  But then, of course, these woke corporations and indeed the military-industrial complex itself appropriates that movement to try and add a sheen of legitimacy to their barbaric actions.
[02:25:54.229 --> 02:26:03.291]   Bombing countries in the Middle East, for example, That was a meme a few months ago, but now the US military has literally fulfilled the meme.
[02:26:05.232 --> 02:26:11.958]  In a tweet to mark the start of Gay Pride Month, the US Marines account tweeted, Throughout June, the USMC takes pride.
[02:26:12.919 --> 02:26:23.568]  And they accompanied this tweet with an image of a military helmet which says, Proud to Serve, with bullets strapped to the helmet in the gay rainbow flag colours.
[02:26:24.457 --> 02:26:28.360]  They end up looking more like lipsticks, so it looks even more stupid.
[02:26:29.120 --> 02:26:37.706]  But again, have any of them who run this Twitter account at the US Marines, obviously you would hope it wasn't the top brass, but they cave anyway.
[02:26:38.186 --> 02:26:42.769]  Remember that thing where they made new recruits march around in red high heels?
[02:26:43.672 --> 02:26:46.635]  They actually went through and fulfilled the meme.
[02:26:46.755 --> 02:26:48.256]  We live in clown world.
[02:26:48.316 --> 02:26:49.517]  We'll be back to talk about it more.
[02:26:49.537 --> 02:26:49.937]  Summit.News.
[02:26:49.957 --> 02:26:50.658]  Don't go away.
[02:26:51.038 --> 02:27:02.368]  So both gay pride activists and indeed the US Marines are now literally fulfilling memes in their desperation to virtue signal and one-up everyone else.
[02:27:03.018 --> 02:27:06.540]  This is also happening with the Ukrainian military, by the way.
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:14.425]  Of course, we have the Azov Battalion, which the media now claims was never far-right neo-Nazi, now that they're our neo-Nazis.
[02:27:14.885 --> 02:27:17.567]  Drop the Nazi insignia from their uniform.
[02:27:18.087 --> 02:27:23.551]  Then we have this headline, Media Hypes New Unicorn LGBTQ Patch for Ukrainian Troops.
[02:27:24.344 --> 02:27:28.186]  They have adopted this unicorn LGBTQ patch.
[02:27:28.226 --> 02:27:42.475]  I guess if the goons who raid people's houses and arrest them for criticising Zelensky in Ukraine, because it's such a democratic country, I guess if they wear gay unicorns on their uniforms then that might make that okay too.
[02:27:43.136 --> 02:27:48.199]  Meanwhile, WHO says gay pride event should go ahead despite monkey pox threat.
[02:27:48.931 --> 02:28:01.722]  Now, of course, experts have said that this monkeypox outbreak originated in two places in Europe, mainly a gay sauna in Spain and a fetish festival in Belgium, because homosexuality is such a healthy lifestyle.
[02:28:02.603 --> 02:28:16.257]   But again, just as they said during the George Floyd riots in June, late May, June 2020, Remember those public health officials literally coming out and saying, no, racism is a bigger public health threat than COVID.
[02:28:16.677 --> 02:28:18.398]  So we're going to lock you down.
[02:28:18.678 --> 02:28:20.679]  We're going to prevent you from seeing your loved ones.
[02:28:20.959 --> 02:28:23.360]  We're going to stop you from going to your grandma's funeral.
[02:28:23.380 --> 02:28:28.382]  We're going to stop you getting diabetes and cancer treatment that's going to kill you in two years time.
[02:28:29.022 --> 02:28:37.845]  Well, those BLM supporters, now they can mass congregate in numbers of thousands and thousands in major cities because that's more important.
[02:28:37.925 --> 02:28:38.906]  Well, they've done it again.
[02:28:40.996 --> 02:28:50.743]  World Health Organisation says global mass gathering events planned for Gay Pride Month shouldn't be cancelled despite the fact that experts say monkeypox is circulating largely amongst LGBT people.
[02:28:51.543 --> 02:29:00.089]  They've literally said top health experts in the UK to gay people, risking stigmatisation, don't have sex with each other.
[02:29:00.290 --> 02:29:07.695]  But now the WHO is saying go out and mass congregate despite the fact that it's transmitted by close proximity contact.
[02:29:07.975 --> 02:29:09.436]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:29:10.074 --> 02:29:13.158]  Let's shift gears now, though, because I want to talk about this in some more depth.
[02:29:13.218 --> 02:29:14.160]  Let's go to this video.
[02:29:14.580 --> 02:29:15.642]  I'll come back and talk about it.
[02:29:15.702 --> 02:29:22.631]  What really happened before the Champions League final this past weekend, which the media buried?
[02:29:22.731 --> 02:29:23.712]  Let's go to this clip.
[02:29:24.773 --> 02:29:30.213]   scenes at the weekend before the Champions League final in Paris between Liverpool and Real Madrid.
[02:29:30.213 --> 02:29:36.212]   So-called Liverpool supporters rushed security and tried to enter the stadium without tickets or with fake tickets.
[02:29:36.212 --> 02:29:42.213]   French police responded by tear-gassing innocent supporters, many of whom hadn't even tried to enter illegally.
[02:29:42.213 --> 02:29:47.093]   That's what we were told by the media, but the first part didn't even happen.
[02:29:47.208 --> 02:29:53.432]  Exactly who was responsible for causing the chaos has been buried by media outlets in the UK.
[02:29:53.492 --> 02:30:01.337]  Here's who really rushed security entering the stadium illegally while also being responsible for countless violent assaults and robberies.
[02:30:05.159 --> 02:30:09.662]  Hmm, they don't look like Liverpool supporters to me.
[02:30:09.941 --> 02:30:16.941]  Take another look.
[02:30:16.941 --> 02:30:21.141]  They look like North African and Middle Eastern migrants.
[02:30:21.246 --> 02:30:30.531]  Which would make sense because Saint-Denis, the area where the Stade de France is located, is one giant ethnic suburb where migrant gangs rule the roost.
[02:30:30.691 --> 02:30:37.535]  In fact, it's estimated a whopping 400,000 illegal immigrants live in the Saint-Denis area of Paris alone.
[02:30:37.655 --> 02:30:40.016]  At least hundreds, maybe even thousands.
[02:30:40.436 --> 02:30:45.820]  saw the 50,000 tourists visiting to watch the game as easy prey.
[02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:52.766]  You can watch numerous videos of people of a certain demographic assaulting Liverpool supporters in the link below.
[02:30:52.866 --> 02:30:54.987]  And how did the French government respond?
[02:30:55.408 --> 02:31:00.311]  By blaming the English football fans who were actually the victims of the chaos.
[02:31:00.471 --> 02:31:02.393]  How did the French riot police respond?
[02:31:02.733 --> 02:31:09.733]  by attacking English football fans.
[02:31:09.733 --> 02:31:11.733]  [crowd noise]
[02:31:11.733 --> 02:31:13.733]  [crowd noise]
[02:31:13.733 --> 02:31:15.733]  [crowd noise]
[02:31:15.733 --> 02:31:17.733]  [crowd noise]
[02:31:17.733 --> 02:31:19.733]  [crowd noise]
[02:31:19.733 --> 02:31:21.733]  [crowd noise]
[02:31:21.733 --> 02:31:23.733]  [crowd noise]
[02:31:23.733 --> 02:31:25.733]  [crowd noise]
[02:31:25.733 --> 02:31:27.733]  [crowd noise]
[02:31:28.653 --> 02:31:32.814]  The French media responded by running cover for the true perpetrators.
[02:31:32.954 --> 02:31:39.335]  Like in the USSR, the population deciphers the lies of the government and the media, said philosopher Matthew Boccotti.
[02:31:39.395 --> 02:31:46.156]  When they say a young person or a sensitive neighborhood, we all spontaneously understand what they're talking about.
[02:31:46.236 --> 02:31:55.978]  The mayor of Liverpool, who was personally attacked and had his cell phone stolen, lambasted UEFA and French authorities for falsely blaming Liverpool fans.
[02:31:56.078 --> 02:32:05.684]  It was falsely claimed that Liverpool fans arrived late when footage shows that the vast majority of them were there several hours before the game began and many were refused entry.
[02:32:05.523 --> 02:32:12.003]   Meanwhile, organised crime gangs with fake tickets or no tickets at all were literally allowed to run riot.
[02:32:12.003 --> 02:32:17.192]   "There were young people from the suburbs who were friends with the attackers," said French sports journalist Daniel
[02:32:17.192 --> 02:32:17.603]  Riolo.
[02:32:17.603 --> 02:32:23.702]   "At least 1,000 thieves, robbers and bandits assaulted families, threw people to the ground, took everything from
[02:32:23.702 --> 02:32:26.963]   them, leaving people outside unable to attend the game," he added.
[02:32:26.963 --> 02:32:30.804]   According to many witnesses, and as can be seen on videos circulating online,
[02:32:30.804 --> 02:32:36.804]   the same stewards who blocked the entrance to fans with real tickets were also letting in people who seemed to be
[02:32:36.804 --> 02:32:41.753]   neighbourhood residents they knew, and who clearly did not have tickets for the game, reports
[02:32:41.753 --> 02:32:42.403]  Remix News.
[02:32:42.280 --> 02:32:48.440]   Gregory Goupil, Secretary General of the Alliance 93 Police Union, told News Channel TF1 Info,
[02:32:48.440 --> 02:32:52.440]   "Colleagues have told us they had never seen so many unaccompanied minors,
[02:32:52.440 --> 02:32:58.280]   mostly North Africans, clustered and hyperactive. One thing is certain, pickpockets came in droves
[02:32:58.280 --> 02:33:03.959]   to steal cash, wallets or phones, sometimes even from the visually impaired or people in wheelchairs."
[02:33:04.151 --> 02:33:11.978]  Claims made by the French Interior Minister that half of the arrests made were of Liverpool supporters were also later completely discredited.
[02:33:12.058 --> 02:33:15.981]  National Rally leader Marine Le Pen summarised what really happened.
[02:33:16.201 --> 02:33:19.844]  Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has lied and continues to lie.
[02:33:20.144 --> 02:33:27.871]  He explains that he did not see what foreign journalists and fans on site saw very well, that is to say a horde of criminals who came to loot and assault people.
[02:33:27.971 --> 02:33:32.915]  The events that took place at the Stade de France are an allegory of all the dangers that weigh on France.
[02:33:33.015 --> 02:33:38.279]  Today we are unable to organise large events, keeping them free of violence and abuse.
[02:33:38.419 --> 02:33:40.181]  And the media covered it all up.
[02:33:40.461 --> 02:33:48.207]  Just like they tried to cover up what happened on New Year's Eve in Cologne in 2015, which was perpetrated by the exact same demographic.
[02:33:48.327 --> 02:33:54.971]  The same demographic which will be around to cause similar chaos when Stade de France hosts the Olympic Games in 2024.
[02:33:55.392 --> 02:34:02.857]  It's really becoming difficult, isn't it, for them to protect the increasingly tenuous narrative that diversity is a strength.
[02:34:05.327 --> 02:34:08.209]  Now, this final was originally planned to be held in St.
[02:34:08.249 --> 02:34:12.733]  Petersburg, Russia, where they don't have similar bountiful joys of diversity.
[02:34:12.773 --> 02:34:14.695]  Of course, that got cancelled because Pooh's in bad.
[02:34:15.255 --> 02:34:18.398]  It took place in Saint-Denis, 400,000 illegal immigrants.
[02:34:18.478 --> 02:34:21.320]  It's one of these notorious no-go zone migrant suburbs.
[02:34:21.861 --> 02:34:23.702]  And basically, all hell broke loose.
[02:34:24.263 --> 02:34:25.684]  I didn't even know about this!
[02:34:26.354 --> 02:34:34.456]  Until like three days after it happened, I even bought the mainstream media narrative that it was Liverpool football fans without tickets.
[02:34:34.856 --> 02:34:35.316]  It wasn't.
[02:34:35.396 --> 02:34:36.756]  They were actually the victims.
[02:34:36.776 --> 02:34:45.078]  There's now an investigation into overreach police brutality by the French cops for tear-gassing the supporters.
[02:34:45.398 --> 02:34:52.219]  There's no investigation into the actual perpetrators, the people behind this bedlam, because that would be racist.
[02:34:52.259 --> 02:34:54.620]  We have an article, they found our fear amusing.
[02:34:55.180 --> 02:34:57.522]  Football fans targeted by migrant gangs.
[02:34:58.262 --> 02:35:06.849]  French-Spanish journalist Alejo Shapira said the official version of the French authorities the problems in the Stade de France were because there were too many Englishmen with false tickets.
[02:35:07.269 --> 02:35:14.794]  However, the testimonies at the scene give accounts of robberies groping by locals from the no-go zone and police disorganization.
[02:35:14.834 --> 02:35:17.276]  It's the usual suspects yet again.
[02:35:17.697 --> 02:35:18.477]  Summit.News.
[02:35:18.497 --> 02:35:19.058]  We'll be back.
[02:35:19.078 --> 02:35:19.518]  Don't go away.
[02:35:20.140 --> 02:35:30.181]  Well, I just talked about what is happening in ethnic suburbs of France with these huge numbers of unintegrated migrants and the chaos they caused before the Champions League final.
[02:35:30.874 --> 02:35:45.462]  In Paris, again it was in Paris but it was in an area of Paris, the stadium is located in an area of Paris which is home to 400,000 illegal immigrants in that area alone, most of whom are from North Africa and the Middle East.
[02:35:45.863 --> 02:36:02.774]   I'm going to get on to talk about what's happening in Sweden with this latest experiences of female Ukrainian refugees in Sweden and in fact how now they're giving Migrants who weren't even born in Sweden the right to vote, which of course is the ultimate goal.
[02:36:03.554 --> 02:36:05.156]  But first we're going to go to this video.
[02:36:05.236 --> 02:36:24.613]  We're going to tell you what happened here in the UK to a village which comprises just 700 residents when the government suddenly announced with zero consultation whatsoever, they were never asked, that 1,500 economic migrants would be dumped on their doorstep.
[02:36:25.433 --> 02:36:25.934]  Here's the clip.
[02:36:25.974 --> 02:36:28.816]  What happened to this small village told to accept 1,500 refugees?
[02:36:28.936 --> 02:36:30.177]  Here it is.
[02:36:34.781 --> 02:36:40.025]  Imagine you lived in a quaint, quiet village comprising of about 700 residents.
[02:36:40.206 --> 02:36:46.851]  And imagine the government suddenly announced it planned to house 1,500 North African and Middle Eastern migrants right on your doorstep.
[02:36:47.011 --> 02:36:54.037]   Oh shi- It's precisely what could be about to happen to the residents of Linton-on-Ouse, a village in North Yorkshire, England.
[02:36:54.197 --> 02:36:57.260]  And suffice to say, the locals aren't too happy about it.
[02:36:59.702 --> 02:37:06.288]  Like Catherine Dryden, who fears that an influx of bored young men is just asking for trouble.
[02:37:06.548 --> 02:37:09.390]  They are going to be bored out of their skulls.
[02:37:10.211 --> 02:37:11.873]  There is no infrastructure in this village.
[02:37:12.373 --> 02:37:14.275]  We're a very small, tight-knit community.
[02:37:14.775 --> 02:37:18.859]  Yes, we will be welcoming them and speak to them, absolutely not a problem, but that is not enough.
[02:37:19.580 --> 02:37:21.461]  What are these people going to do?
[02:37:21.542 --> 02:37:24.064]  But wait, they keep telling me diversity's a strength!
[02:37:24.164 --> 02:37:36.055]  What could these bigots possibly have against their village suddenly doubling in size, swelled by ranks of new doctors, lawyers, culturally enriched by exotic, tasty new foreign food restaurants?
[02:37:36.135 --> 02:37:36.736]  Yeah, how old are you?
[02:37:36.756 --> 02:37:36.736]  15.
[02:37:36.816 --> 02:37:37.156]  Yeah, we're 15.
[02:37:37.196 --> 02:37:37.336]  Who?
[02:37:37.176 --> 02:37:43.176]   A group of schoolgirls videoed as they were propositioned by a couple of asylum seekers.
[02:37:43.176 --> 02:37:44.176]  You know we're 15?
[02:37:44.176 --> 02:37:45.176]  Yeah, how old are you?
[02:37:45.176 --> 02:37:46.176]  15.
[02:37:46.176 --> 02:37:47.176]  You know we're 15?
[02:37:47.176 --> 02:37:48.176]  Who?
[02:37:48.176 --> 02:37:49.176]  Us.
[02:37:49.176 --> 02:37:50.176]  Oh my!
[02:37:50.176 --> 02:37:51.176]  Oh my!
[02:37:51.176 --> 02:37:52.176]  We're 15!
[02:37:52.176 --> 02:37:57.176]  You're 21 and you're asking for a snatch, we're 15.
[02:37:57.176 --> 02:38:00.176]  I'm getting the word nuts.
[02:38:00.176 --> 02:38:04.176]   Don't think that's the kind of cultural enrichment they were anticipating.
[02:38:04.978 --> 02:38:07.059]  Look at the size of this village.
[02:38:07.179 --> 02:38:12.263]  Linton-on-Ouse has one shop on the main road, just four buses run per day.
[02:38:12.383 --> 02:38:15.825]  Locals already wait weeks to get a doctor's appointment.
[02:38:15.945 --> 02:38:18.867]  Much like England, Linton-on-Ouse is full.
[02:38:19.147 --> 02:38:22.690]  There's just no capacity to take in all these people.
[02:38:22.750 --> 02:38:30.496]  Yet they plan to bus in migrants who will outnumber the existing residents by nearly three to one, pure insanity.
[02:38:30.776 --> 02:38:36.421]  And all cooked up without any proper consultation with the local community, and just dumped on them.
[02:38:36.561 --> 02:38:39.063]  It's supposed to be a democratic society, but nobody's asked us.
[02:38:39.703 --> 02:38:42.144]  And now, apparently they're arriving next week.
[02:38:42.225 --> 02:38:47.448]  And this week's announcement of a successful legal challenge will only put the plan on a temporary hold.
[02:38:47.588 --> 02:38:53.211]  Residents have been told by the government they'll get just seven days notice before any migrants arrive.
[02:38:53.311 --> 02:38:55.092]  And this isn't just a one-off case.
[02:38:55.433 --> 02:38:58.014]  It's the plan for the entire country.
[02:38:58.134 --> 02:39:07.959]   Under the Asylum Seeker Dispersal Programme, The government has ordered councils to make more council housing stock and private rented accommodation available to house refugees.
[02:39:08.019 --> 02:39:30.908]   This at the same time that Britain faces a severe housing shortage crisis, with skyrocketing prices and limited supply making home ownership unaffordable for many, with endless Sprawling housing estates being built on the edge of villages and greenbelt land that's supposed to be protected, placing further owner restraint on already creaking NHS infrastructure and other public services.
[02:39:31.068 --> 02:39:40.231]  Meanwhile, at a cost to the taxpayer of five million quid a day, the government is paying for these migrants to be housed in 30,000 hotel rooms a day.
[02:39:41.752 --> 02:39:49.996]  On the seafront in Eastbourne, this hotel would normally be home to some of the many tourists who visit this East Sussex resort.
[02:39:50.796 --> 02:39:53.097]  But these guests are not holidaymakers.
[02:39:53.597 --> 02:39:54.898]  They're asylum seekers.
[02:39:55.418 --> 02:40:00.040]  Some of the tens of thousands who are currently placed in hotel accommodation.
[02:40:00.120 --> 02:40:05.482]  And the authorities seem alarmingly paranoid about news reporters speaking to any of them.
[02:40:05.602 --> 02:40:08.924]  As we filmed, this Home Office minder filmed us.
[02:40:10.084 --> 02:40:13.527]  Another tried to persuade the guests to go back inside.
[02:40:14.147 --> 02:40:17.590]  And as I tried to speak to some of them, I was told I couldn't.
[02:40:18.210 --> 02:40:19.752]  They're not allowed to speak.
[02:40:19.772 --> 02:40:21.033]  Well, they are allowed to speak.
[02:40:21.393 --> 02:40:23.955]  No, they can't give any statement to you.
[02:40:24.475 --> 02:40:25.116]  That's official.
[02:40:25.156 --> 02:40:30.340]  You're telling us on behalf of the Home Office that these people are not allowed to speak to us.
[02:40:30.420 --> 02:40:31.321]  Is that what you're telling us?
[02:40:31.381 --> 02:40:34.923]  Meanwhile, our own homeless population is left to shiver on the streets.
[02:40:35.124 --> 02:40:38.926]  The majority of people sleeping rough in England are from the UK.
[02:40:39.867 --> 02:40:41.609]  No free hotel rooms for them.
[02:40:41.689 --> 02:40:47.394]  They'd be better treated if they hopped on a dinghy from France and came back pretending to be asylum seekers.
[02:40:47.474 --> 02:40:50.876]  Most of these migrant hotels are now completely closed to the public.
[02:40:50.957 --> 02:41:08.410]   Because whenever they try to maintain parts of the hotels for use by tourists and other parts for use by migrants, like in Scarborough, Let's just say the behaviour of the migrants makes the hotel's TripAdvisor and Booking.com review scores plummet faster than a skydiver who forgot his parachute.
[02:41:08.430 --> 02:41:14.293]  One Sudanese migrant at a hotel in Glasgow expressed his gratitude by going on a stabbing spree.
[02:41:14.373 --> 02:41:24.420]  And no, that doesn't mean all migrants are out to do harm, and I don't blame them for wanting to come here, but it only takes a small percentage of a large number to cause significant trouble.
[02:41:28.442 --> 02:41:35.342]   male, they are coming from cultures, in most cases, in which women aren't even treated
[02:41:35.342 --> 02:41:40.781]   as second class citizens. And that leads to fear and terror where the people are put in
[02:41:40.781 --> 02:41:45.382]   Linton on Ouse, on Eastbourne seafront, in Windsor, or wherever it is.
[02:41:45.382 --> 02:41:49.762]   And how did we end up here? Because under a conservative government that promised to
[02:41:49.762 --> 02:41:54.842]   drastically reduce both legal and illegal immigration, our border has more holes in
[02:41:54.842 --> 02:41:57.481]  it than a giant block of Swiss cheese.
[02:41:57.537 --> 02:42:08.367]  Last year alone, nearly 30,000 refugees arrived on boats on UK shores, where they were immediately given a complimentary taxi service and free accommodation by our border force.
[02:42:08.507 --> 02:42:10.729]  And those numbers are only set to increase.
[02:42:10.949 --> 02:42:13.171]  Hundreds more arrived in the past week.
[02:42:13.291 --> 02:42:18.095]  Nigel Farage warns 100,000 could arrive by the end of this year.
[02:42:18.155 --> 02:42:21.658]  The government has vowed to send a small number to Rwanda.
[02:42:21.738 --> 02:42:27.583]   And even if they get past all the lefty legal challenges preventing them from doing so, That's a drop in the ocean.
[02:42:27.643 --> 02:42:33.570]  There have been 4,850 landings since the Rwanda plan was announced back in April.
[02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:40.758]  200 more boat migrants arrived on Tuesday alone because there's no deterrent, only incentive.
[02:42:40.998 --> 02:42:46.702]  Both for illegal economic migrants and the people smugglers making a killing out of the entire racket.
[02:42:46.762 --> 02:42:50.565]  Many of them just rock up on the beach and run to the nearest town or village.
[02:42:50.905 --> 02:42:52.946]  Nobody has a clue who they even are.
[02:42:53.026 --> 02:43:00.031]  Instead of escorting the boats back to France, where they came from, we treat their occupants like celebrities arriving at the Ritz.
[02:43:00.291 --> 02:43:02.993]  And these aren't Ukrainian housewives.
[02:43:03.113 --> 02:43:10.118]  They're almost entirely young men from countries like Iran, Iraq and Afghanistan that aren't even at war.
[02:43:10.518 --> 02:43:12.720]  They're economic migrants.
[02:43:14.195 --> 02:43:17.736]  You can watch the rest of that video at summit.news.
[02:43:17.856 --> 02:43:18.516]  Two points.
[02:43:18.876 --> 02:43:25.097]  People in the comments are saying, oh well, this village probably deserves it because they were all like refugees welcome.
[02:43:25.117 --> 02:43:25.977]  They voted for this.
[02:43:26.357 --> 02:43:27.217]  Actually they didn't.
[02:43:27.538 --> 02:43:34.439]  That's a village in the north where they didn't vote for left-wing pro-mass immigration parties, but they got dumped on anyway.
[02:43:35.199 --> 02:43:36.959]  And the other thing is it's a good news story.
[02:43:36.999 --> 02:43:45.770]   Their mass protests actually worked, at least temporarily, They've staved off this deluge of migrants being dumped on the village.
[02:43:46.150 --> 02:43:51.752]  But it remains to be seen what happens in the future, because as the government has said, it's only a temporary stay.
[02:43:52.412 --> 02:43:56.553]  Meanwhile, migrant crossings surging between Greece and Turkey as tensions rise.
[02:43:56.573 --> 02:44:00.935]  40,000 migrants since the start of the year have crossed from Turkey to Greece.
[02:44:01.852 --> 02:44:07.479]  And Erdogan himself has in the past admitted that he's using these migrants as a political weapon.
[02:44:07.559 --> 02:44:09.101]  We're told diversity is a strength.
[02:44:09.421 --> 02:44:10.422]  He thinks they're a weapon.
[02:44:10.562 --> 02:44:11.403]  Doesn't quite add up.
[02:44:12.044 --> 02:44:14.467]  There's tensions have been mounting between Greece and Turkey.
[02:44:15.347 --> 02:44:22.688]  Because Erdogan stated he would no longer conduct talks with Greek Prime Minister because Greece is trying to block the sale of American fighter planes to Turkey.
[02:44:22.708 --> 02:44:30.530]  So now Erdogan is threatening to flood Greece with more migrants, cause another migrant crisis in retaliation.
[02:44:30.590 --> 02:44:35.210]  Again, kind of suggests that diversity is not a strength if they're being used as a weapon.
[02:44:35.531 --> 02:44:36.651]  Summit.News, we'll be back.
[02:44:36.891 --> 02:44:43.932]  So we've talked about France's problems with its vast hordes of unintegrated migrants, mainly from North Africa and the Middle East.
[02:44:44.710 --> 02:44:54.832]  We've talked about what happened before the Champions League final with that group from the much-vaunted no-go zones that five years ago the media said didn't exist.
[02:44:55.532 --> 02:45:23.525]   We've talked about the UK government's program to disperse quote refugees of whom 90% are men and vast majority are economic migrants out into the local communities including in a small village with 700 residents almost tripling their population And we've talked about President Erdogan in Turkey once again threatening to use migrants as a weapon to flood Greece because Greece is trying to block the sale of American fighter jets to Turkey.
[02:45:24.345 --> 02:45:26.066]  Then we see what's happening in Sweden.
[02:45:27.027 --> 02:45:30.189]  And remember, the Great Replacement is a far-right conspiracy theory.
[02:45:30.229 --> 02:45:36.132]  You're not allowed to talk about it unless you say it's a good thing, which Joe Biden does and all the Democrats do.
[02:45:36.392 --> 02:45:39.194]  Then suddenly it is a real thing and it's a positive development.
[02:45:40.268 --> 02:45:53.294]  And the eventual agenda is something that we now see going on in Sweden, where ethnic Swedes will of course, at current trajectory, be a minority in their own country by 2060.
[02:45:53.334 --> 02:46:05.720]  Breitbart reports Sweden, population 10.3 million, has over 1 million migrants eligible to vote for the first time in the 2022 elections.
[02:46:05.780 --> 02:46:11.467]   And guess which way Foreign-born migrants living in Europe tend to vote.
[02:46:11.928 --> 02:46:16.950]  Well, they tend to vote for left-wing parties that give them more benefits.
[02:46:17.290 --> 02:46:18.190]  What a surprise!
[02:46:18.831 --> 02:46:21.332]  Our total population is just over 10 million people.
[02:46:22.172 --> 02:46:30.816]  An estimated 1 million foreign-born residents of Sweden will be eligible to vote in the coming national elections to be held later this year.
[02:46:31.716 --> 02:46:41.490]   That's 200,000 people Eligible to vote more than were eligible to vote in the previous Swedish national election.
[02:46:42.671 --> 02:46:51.135]  Henrik Oskarsson, professor of political science, said, quote, If you combine voting for the left party and the Social Democrats, it's a clear red vote.
[02:46:51.275 --> 02:46:52.496]  They vote left-wing.
[02:46:52.936 --> 02:46:57.799]  Why do you think left-wing parties want to import them in giant numbers?
[02:46:58.979 --> 02:47:00.800]  Because they really care about the refuge.
[02:47:00.900 --> 02:47:02.021]  No, they want power.
[02:47:03.001 --> 02:47:11.053]  While foreign-born residents of Sweden tend to vote more for left-wing parties on average compared to native-born Swedes, they also tend to vote less in elections overall.
[02:47:11.073 --> 02:47:14.478]  74% of foreign-born Swedes vote compared to 90% of natives.
[02:47:14.859 --> 02:47:16.882]  No doubt more of them can be convinced to vote.
[02:47:17.884 --> 02:47:22.347]  But even so, it's a huge number in the left's favour.
[02:47:22.387 --> 02:47:26.649]  That's why they import them in record numbers any chance they get.
[02:47:27.169 --> 02:47:38.956]  Of course, there was an interesting study carried out in Sweden a few years ago where they found that virtually every left-wing Member of Parliament of the ruling party did not live in a multicultural area of Sweden.
[02:47:38.976 --> 02:47:43.539]  They lived in the whitest area of Gothenburg, for example, possible.
[02:47:44.119 --> 02:47:57.187]  A similar situation you find here in the UK, where often the most vocal virtue signallers when it comes to mass immigration live in the whitest areas of London possible, if not the whitest areas of the country possible.
[02:47:57.227 --> 02:47:59.028]  I've talked about that many times before.
[02:47:59.888 --> 02:48:12.275]  Now, talking about Sweden, they continue to enjoy the benefits of multiculturalism, as do the female Ukrainian refugees who have entered the country in pretty significant numbers over the past few months.
[02:48:12.355 --> 02:48:13.116]  Here's the video.
[02:48:14.156 --> 02:48:25.693]  Dress modestly for diversity, where Ukrainian women in asylum centres in Sweden have been told to cover up because it might provoke a certain demographic.
[02:48:25.954 --> 02:48:26.495]  Here's the clip.
[02:48:27.637 --> 02:48:34.781]  Just that when the West imported all those female Ukrainian refugees, it also imported a bunch of Islamophobic bigots.
[02:48:35.102 --> 02:48:39.865]  Ukrainian women in Sweden warned not to dress in a way that could provoke Muslim men.
[02:48:39.965 --> 02:48:49.170]  And there you were thinking the desperate primary care needs of people fleeing a war zone were more important than upsetting the feelings of Europe's new diverse demographic.
[02:48:49.230 --> 02:48:50.091]  Well, think again.
[02:48:50.251 --> 02:49:04.594]  Ukrainian women at the Galaxan Refugee Center in Olofström, Sweden have been told not to dress in a way that could provoke men from other cultures who also live at Galaxan Housing Facility according to the Swedish newspaper Nyheter Idag.
[02:49:04.694 --> 02:49:15.299]   One refugee aid volunteer working at the facility said that the Ukrainian women made the mistake, before the advisory, Of dressing like other European women.
[02:49:15.379 --> 02:49:17.240]  They usually dressed like us.
[02:49:17.461 --> 02:49:19.743]  You and me, said Jitana Bengtsson.
[02:49:19.823 --> 02:49:21.525]  And that's a big no-no.
[02:49:22.045 --> 02:49:23.667]  This is Sweden, after all.
[02:49:23.747 --> 02:49:28.812]  Which is now basically only a European country in terms of its geographic location.
[02:49:28.972 --> 02:49:36.740]  After being warned that they were provoking horny migrant men into culturally enriching them, the Ukrainian women have now covered up.
[02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:43.602]  As we previously highlighted, some Ukrainian refugees are refusing to be taken to multicultural Sweden because they fear for their safety.
[02:49:43.622 --> 02:49:46.602]  They obviously never got the memo that diversity is a strength.
[02:49:46.882 --> 02:49:56.805]  More bigotry was on display when female Ukrainian refugees complained about Muslim migrants breaking into their accommodation and attempting to sexually assault them.
[02:49:56.865 --> 02:49:57.565]  How dare they!
[02:49:57.705 --> 02:50:04.984]   Having been one of the safest country in Europe 20 years ago before mass uncontrolled immigration, Sweden is now the continent's
[02:50:04.984 --> 02:50:06.465]  second most dangerous.
[02:50:06.465 --> 02:50:13.345]   Last year Germany's Bild newspaper ran the headline, "Sweden is the most dangerous country in Europe".
[02:50:13.345 --> 02:50:17.984]   The country is routinely beset by violent riots staged by migrant youths.
[02:50:17.984 --> 02:50:25.024]   But yeah, if women just stop dressing like women, maybe they'll all calm down and start being nice.
[02:50:28.044 --> 02:50:30.366]  Let's move on to some other news now, though.
[02:50:30.466 --> 02:50:38.315]  In the final four minutes of the show, World Economic Forum urges people to eat seaweed, algae and cacti to save the planet!
[02:50:39.116 --> 02:50:55.105]   This was a Twitter video they put out a few days ago where the WEF technocrats urged people to ditch meat and other foods deemed harmful to the planet And instead consume climate beneficial foods such as seaweed, algae and cacti.
[02:50:55.145 --> 02:50:56.845]  Of course, we know what this is all about.
[02:50:57.125 --> 02:51:09.328]  This is about lowering your living standards, which they're now doing via food price hikes, global food shortages caused by their support for the current thing.
[02:51:09.368 --> 02:51:18.771]  Of course, they blame Vladimir Putin for it, just like the Biden administration blamed him for the runaway inflation that was already happening way before the invasion of Ukraine.
[02:51:19.565 --> 02:51:33.114]  Of course, the WEF previously published two articles on their website which explored how people could be conditioned to get used to the idea of eating weeds, bugs and drinking sewage water in order to reduce CO2 emissions.
[02:51:33.714 --> 02:51:47.084]   Now, you know what was not on the menu at the COP26 climate change conference last year in Scotland, attended by many of the same people who attend Davos and the World Economic Forum, They weren't drinking sewage water.
[02:51:47.404 --> 02:51:54.446]  They weren't eating cacti, seaweed, or indeed bugs to lower their CO2 emissions.
[02:51:54.846 --> 02:51:58.827]  What they did do was fly in on a phalanx of private jets.
[02:51:59.387 --> 02:52:02.048]  Because it's okay when they do it.
[02:52:02.248 --> 02:52:04.269]  You need to lower your CO2 emissions.
[02:52:04.589 --> 02:52:11.031]  You need to cancel that one international holiday you may be lucky to have if you can still afford it with your family per year.
[02:52:11.812 --> 02:52:22.715]  They still get to fly in on private jets to all these conferences, eat the finest meat, the finest cuisine possible, while you're going to eat crickets, grasshoppers and mealworms.
[02:52:23.595 --> 02:52:33.398]  No word on whether sewage water or cacti or algae were on the menu at Davos last week, but hazard a guess that they weren't.
[02:52:34.383 --> 02:52:51.368]  But again, this kind of pod-dwelling, bug-eating meme that the establishment continually pushes in the name of lowering CO2 emissions, we've mainly seen it via technocrats like the WEF, we've mainly seen it via quirky lifestyle pieces on CNN and stuff like that.
[02:52:51.948 --> 02:52:57.210]  Where we haven't seen it so far, but we have now, is in schools.
[02:52:57.270 --> 02:52:59.631]  We don't have time to play this video, I'll tell you about it.
[02:53:00.245 --> 02:53:08.107]  Four schools in Wales are now conducting a science experiment where they make kids eat bugs to save the planet.
[02:53:08.487 --> 02:53:21.050]  But again, they emphasise in this experiment the point of it is for these kids to then go home and bully their parents into ditching other foods and eating the bugs.
[02:53:21.090 --> 02:53:32.022]   Again, it's Brainwashing the kids with social engineering in schools and then weaponising the kids to use that brainwashing to pressure their own parents, divide and conquer.
[02:53:33.564 --> 02:53:38.850]  Meanwhile, lockdown advocates have been proven to be on the completely wrong side of history once again.
[02:53:39.699 --> 02:53:40.139]  Report!
[02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:45.965]  More than 3,000 diabetics in UK died because of Covid lockdowns.
[02:53:46.025 --> 02:54:16.104]   Remember, as I mentioned earlier, while all those Black Lives Matter supporters were not only allowed but encouraged by the media, by the establishment, indeed by the government, to go out and congregate in mass numbers while you were told you couldn't go to your grandma's funeral or see your loved ones or get a doctor's appointment, In another damning analysis of the impact of lockdowns, it has been estimated more than 3,000 people in the UK alone with diabetes unnecessarily died because they were unable to get check-ups.
[02:54:16.565 --> 02:54:30.636]  Telegraph reports an NHS study found a move to remote healthcare and a reduction in routine care in the first 12 months of the pandemic had quote, absolutely devastating consequences for diabetics and resulted in them being pushed to the back of the queue.
[02:54:31.500 --> 02:54:44.544]  Again, we don't even know the full toll yet of deaths from missed cancer screenings, missed heart disease screenings, and all these other important check-ups that people needed desperately to have.
[02:54:44.904 --> 02:54:56.947]  Those numbers are going to come out over the next six months, over the next two years, and they're going to prove once again that lockdown advocates, as they scurry away with their tails tucked between their legs, were on the wrong side of history.
[02:54:56.967 --> 02:54:57.707]  That's going to wrap it up.
[02:54:57.747 --> 02:54:58.488]  War Room is next.
[02:54:58.528 --> 02:54:59.288]  Summit.News.
[02:54:59.468 --> 02:54:59.948]  Don't go away.
[02:55:01.448 --> 02:55:02.449]  I am beyond driven.
[02:55:03.970 --> 02:55:05.290]  I am beyond obsessed.
[02:55:06.651 --> 02:55:18.738]  I am completely and wholly committed to the fight against the new world order and cannot and will never stop until I'm dead.
[02:55:19.659 --> 02:55:28.984]  We have to reinforce our resilience against a new virus possibly or other risks which we have on the global agenda.
[02:55:29.332 --> 02:55:33.556]  We need to accept that there will be some pain in the process.
[02:55:33.797 --> 02:55:38.822]  I think we're going to have to think about a recalibration of a whole range of human rights that are playing out online.
[02:55:38.902 --> 02:55:40.624]  The future is not just happening.
[02:55:41.471 --> 02:55:42.951]  The future is built by us.
[02:55:43.412 --> 02:55:47.893]  Through technology, an ability for consumers to measure their own carbon footprint.
[02:55:48.173 --> 02:55:50.994]  Many of these things will be built directly into our bodies.
[02:55:51.194 --> 02:55:53.754]  Individual carbon footprint tracker.
[02:55:54.975 --> 02:56:03.117]  You see every day how the world is falling apart with the different crises which we have to manage.
[02:56:03.537 --> 02:56:14.937]   But if you want this weapon system that is InfoWars, that uses the truth savagely against the enemy, To be effective and to be strong when we go into the battle.
[02:56:16.958 --> 02:56:21.081]  Then I ask you to take up your sword politically, not violently.
[02:56:22.703 --> 02:56:27.546]  And I ask you to execute on the future for us together in this victory.
[02:56:27.586 --> 02:56:30.849]  And I tell you that you've done incredible things.
[02:56:30.889 --> 02:56:33.471]  We've already done amazing things together.
[02:56:34.852 --> 02:56:36.873]  And that we must not fail in this mission.
[02:56:37.819 --> 02:56:41.343]  And God says the lukewarm will be spit out of his mouth.
[02:56:42.464 --> 02:56:50.634]  So either join Satan and serve evil or join God and serve good and make the decision now and do it.
[02:56:51.627 --> 02:56:56.630]  If I had the capital, we could do so much great work, and I hate coming to you and saying, hey, you need to support us more.
[02:56:56.950 --> 02:57:01.132]  We have products that are amazing, that you need, that are available now.
[02:57:01.912 --> 02:57:11.317]  Water filtration, air filtration, shortwave radios, amazing tactical gear, super high quality supplements, amazing products across the board.
[02:57:12.097 --> 02:57:22.326]   Our victory spiritually and politically And culturally, has never been more manifest and has never been stronger.
[02:57:23.766 --> 02:57:37.649]  But now, I need you to make the decision in the fight to go to InfoWarsTore.com and right at the top it says, become a sponsor, support InfoWars, make a one-time donation, make a recurring donation, cancel any time for free.
[02:57:39.789 --> 02:57:46.662]   To go to InfoWars.com forward slash crypto to Give a donation.
[02:57:48.142 --> 02:57:49.623]  Get the great new Faraday bags.
