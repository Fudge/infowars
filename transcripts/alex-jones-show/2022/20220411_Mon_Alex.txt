[00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:19.008]   I'll tell going to the end no matter what happens whether we win lose I collapse I'm just telling you I've got more victory left in me I'm long in the tooth now folks 48 in a 28 year war is like I'm a hundred okay The enemy looks and goes, he looks tired.
[00:00:19.048 --> 00:00:19.668]  He looks hurt.
[00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:20.989]  Yeah, I look hurt.
[00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:23.650]  I've been stabbing your ass hard.
[00:00:24.371 --> 00:00:25.171]  I've been biting you.
[00:00:25.251 --> 00:00:26.452]  I've been, yeah.
[00:00:26.932 --> 00:00:28.013]  You bet I look bad.
[00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:32.615]  Because I've been putting my will against you for a long time.
[00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:35.297]  I have set the fires.
[00:00:35.977 --> 00:00:37.899]  We have prepared the resistance.
[00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.480]  We have laid the way.
[00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.602]  You bet I'm hurt.
[00:00:45.046 --> 00:00:46.288]  You bet I'm screwed up now!
[00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:48.511]  Ain't no going back now!
[00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:50.253]  And I know!
[00:00:52.031 --> 00:01:02.974]  My best days are still here to come, but I can't fight these people in the ring for you if you don't pray for me, and if you don't spread the word, and if you don't buy our products.
[00:01:02.994 --> 00:01:10.036]  And I'm telling you, I'm telling you, as sure as the sun came up this morning, if you don't support us financially, we're going to implode very, very soon.
[00:01:10.576 --> 00:01:14.457]  And the globalists will celebrate like chickens with their heads cut off, but that's okay.
[00:01:14.777 --> 00:01:15.357]  That's what they do.
[00:01:16.177 --> 00:01:18.177]  Alright ladies and gentlemen!
[00:01:18.177 --> 00:01:35.177]  (Screaming)
[00:01:35.177 --> 00:01:40.177]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:50.177]  (Music)
[00:01:50.097 --> 00:01:56.763]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you ought to fight!
[00:02:01.108 --> 00:02:29.268]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:36.268]   Former Governor Ron DeSantis signed an anti-groomer bill into law that prevents school teachers
[00:02:36.268 --> 00:02:43.546]   from engaging five-year-olds about homosexual sex acts and radical transgender ideology.
[00:02:43.546 --> 00:02:45.707]  The groomers have come out of the woodwork.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.741]  And many people are waking up to the dark side of Disney.
[00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:59.402]  Investigative journalist Christopher Ruffo has outlined a partial list of Disney employees who have been arrested for child sex crimes.
[00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:06.084]  Robert Kingsolver was a service manager who oversaw ride repairs at the Magic Kingdom.
[00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:13.005]  He was arrested in 2014 for soliciting sex from an agent posing as a 14-year-old girl.
[00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:31.299]  Alan Treister, a concierge at Animal Kingdom Lodge, who used to work at Disney's popular Toy Story ride, advertised himself online as Big Teddy Bear for Younger Chaser and confessed to having sex with a 15-year-old boy he groomed online.
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:42.628]  Animal Kingdom Lodge gift shop worker Paul Fazio was convicted of downloading child pornography videos showing sexual activity with adults and children.
[00:03:43.568 --> 00:03:53.753]  Character actor Patrick Holgerson was arrested in 2014 after sending nude photos online while trying to meet up with a 13-year-old boy.
[00:03:54.974 --> 00:04:09.201]  Justin Hazan, an operator on the Millennium Falcon Ride, and Arlandra Sims, a food runner at the Animal Kingdom Resort, were busted in 2020 for selling child pornography with victims as young as four years old.
[00:04:10.161 --> 00:04:26.070]  Disney Cruise Line Youth Host Oliver Lovat was arrested in 2019 for molesting a 10-year-old boy aboard the Disney Magic Ship's Oceaneer Kids Lab after blindfolding the child and spinning him around several times as part of a game.
[00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:36.754]  In 2012, an 11-year-old girl was groped and kissed in an elevator by 33-year-old Milton Braganza, a dining server on the Disney Dream.
[00:04:37.534 --> 00:04:43.197]  A cruise line security officer was told by Disney officials to keep her mouth shut and do nothing.
[00:04:43.897 --> 00:04:56.686]  Two days later, when the ship arrived in Nassau, Berganza admitted to the Bahamas police that he molested the girl, and was then taken to the airport, where Disney arranged for his flight back home to India.
[00:04:57.727 --> 00:05:06.493]  Last year, Hollywood Studios custodians Jonathan McGrew and Savannah Lawrence were caught attempting to have a threesome with a 13-year-old.
[00:05:07.034 --> 00:05:12.478]  McGrew said that the couple's fantasy was to play stepdad, stepdaughter, stepmother.
[00:05:13.238 --> 00:05:22.351]  Animal Kingdom Lodge lifeguard Kenneth Aquino was arrested after trying to have sex with a 13 year old showing up in his Disney work clothes.
[00:05:23.453 --> 00:05:29.822]  Of course, child predators will naturally seek employment at Disney, but it's everywhere within the company.
[00:05:30.442 --> 00:05:37.564]  Director of music publishing John Healy was charged with three felony counts of child sexual abuse in 2017.
[00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:45.386]  Vice President Michael Laney was convicted of sexually abusing a seven-year-old girl in 2019.
[00:05:46.326 --> 00:05:56.229]  Both actor-producer Brian Peck and director Victor Salva were rehired by Disney after they served time for raping children from the set.
[00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:06.132]  The subliminal sexualization of children has demonstrably been a part of Disney's work for generations, embedded into their animations.
[00:06:07.412 --> 00:06:20.457]  Several whistleblowers have claimed that Disney has been used since its very beginning as a form of mind control and MKUltra, most famously for their Project Monarch princess programming of little girls.
[00:06:21.958 --> 00:06:36.233]  So it's really no surprise that Disney's corporate president admittedly wants to flood Disney stories with the so-called LGBTQIA agenda, which we now understand to be code for pedophilia.
[00:06:37.074 --> 00:06:44.074]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:06:44.074 --> 00:07:01.874]  InfoWars. Tomorrow's news. Today.
[00:07:02.036 --> 00:07:10.337]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak.
[00:07:10.457 --> 00:07:11.518]  Let me think, just let me think.
[00:07:11.538 --> 00:07:17.079]  I suspect even now orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way.
[00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:18.499]  It's Chancellor Settler.
[00:07:18.619 --> 00:07:19.119]  Damn it!
[00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:19.659]  Why?
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:30.042]   Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of combat, Words are the means to meaning, and for those who listen,
[00:07:32.912 --> 00:07:37.533]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:38.553]  You designed it, sir.
[00:07:38.613 --> 00:07:39.513]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:41.014]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:07:41.194 --> 00:07:44.634]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[00:07:45.094 --> 00:07:55.096]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subduing your submission.
[00:07:55.116 --> 00:07:55.656]  We need cameras.
[00:07:55.956 --> 00:07:56.657]  How did this happen?
[00:07:57.377 --> 00:07:58.157]  Who's to blame?
[00:07:59.117 --> 00:08:01.818]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:08:02.179 --> 00:08:03.839]  They will be held accountable.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:09.662]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:08:10.803 --> 00:08:12.544]  I know why you did it.
[00:08:12.784 --> 00:08:13.884]  I know you were afraid.
[00:08:14.305 --> 00:08:14.925]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:08:15.525 --> 00:08:17.907]  War, terror, disease.
[00:08:18.207 --> 00:08:24.553]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:08:24.653 --> 00:08:30.377]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:08:30.698 --> 00:08:37.698]   He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:08:37.698 --> 00:08:46.698]  There is a war. It's happening now.
[00:08:46.698 --> 00:08:51.698]   It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come.
[00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:56.698]  We are the resistance. We are the InfoWar.
[00:08:56.698 --> 00:08:58.698]  [Explosion]
[00:08:58.698 --> 00:09:03.698]  Evil.
[00:09:04.113 --> 00:09:07.274]  Has been growing and building its power in the shadows.
[00:09:07.895 --> 00:09:26.443]  And now, with every day, you see what appears to be unlimited energy by the forces of Satan as they expand and launch massive attacks across our planet against the devil's enemy, humanity, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:27.315 --> 00:09:37.358]  What an incredible time to be alive, what an incredible time to be here with you on air, being able to speak with you, being able to talk with you.
[00:09:39.038 --> 00:09:39.679]  What a blessing.
[00:09:40.419 --> 00:10:06.342]   You know, I went to the grocery store last night to get some groceries, we'd run out of some basics, and almost every section was 90 to 80 percent empty, and It just was emblematic of what's happening, where even in Texas, one of the most independent states for food and energy and transportation, you name it, that there wasn't enough food.
[00:10:06.362 --> 00:10:09.404]  And I went and talked to some of the stockers and I said, is this just because it's Sunday night?
[00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:11.465]  They said, no, it's like this a lot now.
[00:10:12.546 --> 00:10:19.051]  Other areas like the East Coast that don't grow their own food, like Florida or Texas or California, they're just empty.
[00:10:20.063 --> 00:10:25.005]  When the prices were massive, I bought one red onion for three times what prices were just a few months ago.
[00:10:25.886 --> 00:10:27.287]  And here's what I'm talking about right here.
[00:10:27.307 --> 00:10:29.167]  It's an article on InfoWars.com from Zero Hedge.
[00:10:29.548 --> 00:10:34.370]  Baby formula shortages hit Walgreens as rationing begins.
[00:10:36.231 --> 00:10:39.032]  And all over the country, basic staples are running out.
[00:10:39.072 --> 00:10:44.495]  Now this was all done by devaluation of currencies and around the world, two years of lockdown.
[00:10:47.162 --> 00:10:51.467]  But it's all blamed on Russia, and if it was Russia's fault, great, easy to blame them, we could deal with Russia.
[00:10:51.807 --> 00:11:04.100]  No, it's the New World Order, a much more formidable enemy, because their agents have penetrated, I don't want to put the live show feed on screen for people, their agents have penetrated almost every government on Earth.
[00:11:05.021 --> 00:11:09.465]  In China, in Russia, in India, even countries you think aren't aligned with the globalists, they're just as bad.
[00:11:09.485 --> 00:11:11.266]  In fact, China is the model of it.
[00:11:12.027 --> 00:11:19.092]  They are infiltrated, as Klaus Schwab said a few months ago, we have penetrated all the cabinets and have 50% control now.
[00:11:20.033 --> 00:11:21.034]  No one can stop us.
[00:11:21.394 --> 00:11:23.836]  We will collapse the economy and bring in the new system.
[00:11:25.357 --> 00:11:25.998]  There's the headline.
[00:11:27.119 --> 00:11:28.420]  Next level transmission.
[00:11:31.238 --> 00:11:36.101]  Learn why globalists are triggering a complete collapse in the end of the world as we know it.
[00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:38.202]  That's not talk.
[00:11:38.342 --> 00:11:39.403]  That's not hyperbole.
[00:11:39.443 --> 00:11:41.464]  That's not hyper-rhetoric.
[00:11:42.804 --> 00:11:43.525]  That's reality.
[00:11:45.186 --> 00:11:51.969]  And you know, behind the scenes you've noticed I've not been on air a lot lately because of the globalists, the Democrats, their lawsuits, but other things.
[00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:54.611]  There are other attacks that I'm not at liberty to get into yet.
[00:11:56.067 --> 00:12:01.732]  They're the most intense ever, that are spiritual, that are like the Matrix movie, or the Twilight Zone.
[00:12:02.593 --> 00:12:05.676]  And I'm dealing with that, and I knew we would get to this point, but let me explain something.
[00:12:05.936 --> 00:12:09.099]  The Bible talks about, as you enter the end times, hell will be opened.
[00:12:10.231 --> 00:12:14.053]  Only a portion of Satan's legions were upon the earth before.
[00:12:14.653 --> 00:12:16.954]  Now the full legions are being released.
[00:12:16.994 --> 00:12:18.075]  The operatives.
[00:12:18.095 --> 00:12:19.916]  People go, this sounds kooky.
[00:12:19.936 --> 00:12:26.699]  Well, the Bible says an off-world creature is marooned here and has millions of agents that work for him that are eternal.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.441]  And that's what we're facing.
[00:12:30.301 --> 00:12:35.644]  And the Bible said their goal, world government, ten kings, three mega regions, total control, the end of the family.
[00:12:37.196 --> 00:12:47.402]  Forced injections, a mark to buy and sell, you must worship the beast, that means do what it says, follow its religion, a political correctness or you won't eat, you won't be able to travel, you won't be able to live, you will die.
[00:12:50.344 --> 00:13:01.131]  And you have all these pathetic Satanists and minions of this that rolled over to it during the good times, a little taste of power, and now it's all running out very, very quickly.
[00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:07.708]   And they're all going to eat their own, it's going to be a spectacular Disaster.
[00:13:07.728 --> 00:13:12.271]  Yeah, there's the head of the Rothschild family with the head, Alistair Crowley, which Abramovich.
[00:13:15.893 --> 00:13:20.775]  And there she is with a painting of Lucifer summoning his legions.
[00:13:21.896 --> 00:13:23.777]  Great job crew with the TV viewers.
[00:13:24.097 --> 00:13:25.598]  I'll line up in like 10 seconds.
[00:13:26.018 --> 00:13:26.518]  We don't script.
[00:13:26.538 --> 00:13:27.038]  We're going to put up.
[00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:28.519]  They just hear what I say and they riff off it.
[00:13:28.939 --> 00:13:29.540]  I like jazz.
[00:13:31.806 --> 00:13:45.309]  I'm going to ask all listeners for this though right now because I know we're a focal point and the enemy's coming against us and everything it's got on all levels and I just want you to know that we could be off the air in just weeks with the things that are being done behind the scenes against us and I don't fear that.
[00:13:45.809 --> 00:13:48.510]  The reason I'm concerned is that means it's very close for all of you.
[00:13:49.230 --> 00:14:00.913]  When they pull out the knife to finally stab me politically, culturally, spiritually, sexually, every level, at that point I know when I let them stab me.
[00:14:01.755 --> 00:14:33.801]   That we are entering the end of the system and that means a hell that I can't imagine you can't imagine it's it's I've got a confession to make I've not had the will as of late to even tell you what's coming next because it's so horrible speaking aloud and I have been really guilty that I have I know what's gonna happen and I have not been able to say it because it's just I I don't want I know it's my job to do it, and I'm being spurred to do it by God.
[00:14:35.604 --> 00:14:42.193]  And it's just such a big task to lay this out that I have a lot of trouble.
[00:14:43.183 --> 00:14:52.248]  But I told you just a few years ago, you'd soon see pedos in Congress and in the news and the owners of the companies saying, we want your children, we're going to have your children, we're going to groom your children, we're going to have sex with them.
[00:14:52.588 --> 00:14:59.231]  And now all the mainstream media, Disney, everything is saying, we want your kids, we're going to teach them how to have sex, we're going to have sex with them.
[00:14:59.551 --> 00:15:00.812]  Because that's destroying the future.
[00:15:00.832 --> 00:15:01.672]  It's destroying love.
[00:15:01.692 --> 00:15:05.954]  It's destroying people meeting each other and liking each other and having a relationship and forming a family.
[00:15:06.395 --> 00:15:12.698]  It is destroying God's most powerful ritual on this planet, the union of men and women coming together through love.
[00:15:17.438 --> 00:15:18.599]  And we'll cover that when we come back.
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:26.683]  But we can look at all the other news and talk about all the global developments and talk about the food shortages and everything that's happening.
[00:15:27.163 --> 00:15:31.986]  But at the end of the day, God says they're going to come after our children and they're going to give them the fires of Moloch.
[00:15:32.226 --> 00:15:33.787]  They can throw them right in the fire and burn them up.
[00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:34.988]  They'll do it quick and do it.
[00:15:35.268 --> 00:15:35.908]  But they can't.
[00:15:35.928 --> 00:15:37.509]  They've got to have other ways to get it done.
[00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:46.674]  They have to have other systems to be able to carry that out.
[00:15:48.976 --> 00:15:49.837]  That's what we're witnessing.
[00:15:50.938 --> 00:15:54.581]  That's what we're living through here today.
[00:15:56.823 --> 00:16:03.389]  So I just pray to the creator of the universe, the God of everything, the spirit that is all-knowing and is infinite.
[00:16:05.165 --> 00:16:36.210]   Pour out your will upon us so that we can stand against this evil and you give us the will, the foresight, the discernment and the courage to follow through with your plans and help us be clean, ready vessels for your spirit in this great challenge to march forward and stand against the enemy as it throws all its weight against us because we forgot you and we turned our backs on you and so you opened the gates, you lowered the defense system, the shields are down and you're showing us that you will not protect us if we do not stand with you Please help us, God!
[00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:45.694]  God says, your people must plead and bring themselves before me and get on their knees and repent and I will heal their land.
[00:16:46.495 --> 00:16:47.255]  Infowars!
[00:16:48.035 --> 00:16:50.076]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:16:51.057 --> 00:16:58.040]  Well, you read about those times in history where the world goes crazy and 20, 30, 40 percent of the population, sometimes 50, dies.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:08.587]  Hell, sometimes whole civilizations in Europe, in Mesoamerica, in Africa, in Asia, in the steppes just disappear.
[00:17:08.807 --> 00:17:09.548]  Everybody dies.
[00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:23.040]  And they find big mass graves of people that have been eaten with human tooth marks chewing the meat off the bones.
[00:17:24.802 --> 00:17:24.962]  Yeah.
[00:17:26.377 --> 00:17:31.919]  They found a bunch of places in France, and in Germany, and in Africa, and in the Americas.
[00:17:32.299 --> 00:17:36.280]  Didn't matter if it was Native Americans, didn't matter if it was Germans, didn't matter if it was Africans.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:44.802]  They just suddenly would see, like, villages themselves, because they find the same headdresses, the same accoutrements, the same tribal artifacts.
[00:17:45.422 --> 00:17:50.724]  Villages would just go crazy and go from being really successful and great to killing and war and then eating each other.
[00:17:52.756 --> 00:18:00.782]  Just a few years ago, they found a town in Germany with hundreds of thousands of skeletons just all over, eaten by other humans.
[00:18:05.666 --> 00:18:06.446]  Why'd they do that?
[00:18:07.047 --> 00:18:08.288]  Most cases, it's not famine.
[00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.171]  Something happens.
[00:18:12.351 --> 00:18:13.392]  A spirit comes in.
[00:18:14.813 --> 00:18:21.318]  And by increment, we become more evil, more corrupt, more animalistic, and then everything spirals out of control, and we kill each other.
[00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:25.409]  Every culture has sacrificed its children.
[00:18:25.509 --> 00:18:32.232]  I don't care if you've got a Native American background, or an Asian background, or an African background, or a white background.
[00:18:32.932 --> 00:18:35.953]  You got one thing in common.
[00:18:36.113 --> 00:18:49.839]  Your ancestors, at one point or another, ate children, burned children, tortured children, cut children's hearts out, froze children to death, gave them to Moloch, threw them into fiery pits.
[00:18:51.664 --> 00:18:52.765]  Where is this coming from?
[00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:56.947]  Why is it in the Old Testament and carved on Egyptian hieroglyphics?
[00:18:58.428 --> 00:18:58.808]  What was it?
[00:18:58.848 --> 00:19:04.271]  Ramses II's father ordered all Israelite firstborns to be killed.
[00:19:04.671 --> 00:19:04.971]  Males.
[00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:08.193]  That's just one group he ordered killed.
[00:19:09.174 --> 00:19:10.054]  You know how they were killed?
[00:19:10.114 --> 00:19:10.775]  By the sword.
[00:19:11.615 --> 00:19:12.636]  He didn't do it in a ritual.
[00:19:13.696 --> 00:19:14.597]  But it was still a ritual.
[00:19:16.057 --> 00:19:18.719]  And now we kill our firstborn with Ritalin and Prozac.
[00:19:18.759 --> 00:19:20.360]  Now we kill them with abortion.
[00:19:22.014 --> 00:19:22.735]  Firstborn son.
[00:19:24.836 --> 00:19:53.255]   If something happens, they know, in all mammals, in the first birth of a female, with the first sperm and first egg, there's a particular metaphysical electromagnetic activation of epigenetical information within that new forming entity that is transmitted The sum total of the genetic memory of the species through those bloodlines.
[00:19:57.237 --> 00:20:18.321]   And when the ruling cult of the planet senses that those bloodlines are fighting the tyranny and fighting the takeover, and parents sense it and don't know what to do, it electrochemically and Fifth and sixth dimensionally programs the cells for the sperms and the eggs to produce the next group that will inherently know how to answer and defeat it.
[00:20:18.441 --> 00:20:22.441]   And so the only answer the Satanists have is kill the children,
[00:20:22.441 --> 00:20:26.441]   because it's going to be those incredible children of every race, color, and creed,
[00:20:26.441 --> 00:20:29.799]   one race, the human race, that are going to lead us out of this.
[00:20:29.799 --> 00:20:36.921]  Because those aren't just children.
[00:20:37.144 --> 00:20:38.184]  Those are men and women.
[00:20:38.224 --> 00:20:39.164]  Those are leaders!
[00:20:43.286 --> 00:20:46.887]  We hear about how men are bad and masculinity is evil by big universities and governments.
[00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:48.668]  Men just aren't good.
[00:20:48.768 --> 00:20:49.608]  Men are essential.
[00:20:52.409 --> 00:20:58.551]  Because when we've got men that stand up and have honor and duty to their family and their culture and their country, then they stand against evil.
[00:21:00.179 --> 00:21:09.183]  But in this world, we're told men that dress like women are women, and that women should act like men, and that really masculine men that are real men are a bad commodity.
[00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:21.087]  That's because an alien off-world force, it's spiritual, it's interdimensional, it has a transmission, it has a spirit, but it also has agents.
[00:21:22.388 --> 00:21:22.688]  Aliens.
[00:21:24.178 --> 00:21:24.538]  Demons.
[00:21:25.419 --> 00:21:36.983]  And they are working against us around the clock because they know we are about to go from our embryonic level to birthing into the next level.
[00:21:39.324 --> 00:21:56.428]   And that we're going to go from that pupa, that chrysalis, that cocoon, And like a butterfly, become the next phase of what God has in store.
[00:21:57.549 --> 00:21:58.629]  And they don't want that.
[00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.752]  They have a jealousy and a deep hatred for our beauty.
[00:22:05.992 --> 00:22:06.853]  And our power.
[00:22:08.553 --> 00:22:09.414]  And our glory.
[00:22:11.074 --> 00:22:16.077]  They're ever-seeking, ever-working to take that away and to sabotage us and to hurt us.
[00:22:16.417 --> 00:22:18.818]  But they know once we grow older, we become strong.
[00:22:20.154 --> 00:22:26.817]  If we're allowed to have a decent path and find God ourselves and find God's universe ourselves, we become strong.
[00:22:26.877 --> 00:22:32.499]  But if they can hijack us when we're little babies, they can get us when we're tiny.
[00:22:34.164 --> 00:22:53.349]  And screw us up, and then teach us to the Stockholm Syndrome to serve the system, to the LGBTQTP, then they've wrecked someone that they can maintain control over for the rest of their lives, that they can then dominate, that they can then own, that will be their slave forever.
[00:22:56.079 --> 00:23:03.783]  Armies of effeminate, anorexic men dressed as women saying, I need access to first graders.
[00:23:05.003 --> 00:23:08.345]  I need access to second and third and fourth and fifth graders.
[00:23:08.785 --> 00:23:10.426]  I need access to three-year-olds!
[00:23:10.506 --> 00:23:12.066]  I've got a clip I'll play next segment.
[00:23:12.226 --> 00:23:13.147]  Hell, let's play it right now.
[00:23:16.311 --> 00:23:23.414]  Non-binary elementary teacher says three-year-olds are old enough to learn about gender from them to form a sexual relationship with them.
[00:23:23.975 --> 00:23:26.216]  Identity and sexual orientation and pronouns.
[00:23:26.736 --> 00:23:30.598]  Listen to the groomers as they launch.
[00:23:32.295 --> 00:23:36.958]  Hi, I'm a queer teacher and I 1000% do not support this bill.
[00:23:37.518 --> 00:23:38.619]  And yes, I do know what's in it.
[00:23:38.639 --> 00:23:43.242]  The bill in itself is just another way to stigmatize the LGBTQ plus community.
[00:23:43.682 --> 00:23:48.385]  Kids as young as 3 and 4 are actually aware of their gender identity, even if they don't have the language for it.
[00:23:48.405 --> 00:23:51.167]  They're also very aware of who they like and who they don't like.
[00:23:51.787 --> 00:23:55.171]  Heterosexuality is pushed on our kids on a daily basis at a very young age.
[00:23:55.391 --> 00:23:56.352]  Media, through books.
[00:23:56.772 --> 00:23:58.073]  The first Disney movie that you saw.
[00:23:58.094 --> 00:24:04.760]  To say that pre-k through third grade are not ready for such topics is actually internalized homophobia and transphobia.
[00:24:04.780 --> 00:24:10.286]  They're very much ready for these topics and are way more accepting than adults when it comes to discussing these topics.
[00:24:10.708 --> 00:24:13.811]  You can talk about gender, gender assumptions, pronouns, all the things.
[00:24:14.452 --> 00:24:18.116]  And it is child development appropriate and age appropriate.
[00:24:18.136 --> 00:24:22.020]  It was literally created as just another means to other queer people.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.483]  Basically say that us existing is not normal.
[00:24:28.786 --> 00:24:31.649]  They say accept us and then you've got to quote be us.
[00:24:32.881 --> 00:24:39.911]  And it's men in clown outfits wanting to have access to children and weirdos saying we're politically correct and bringing them to him.
[00:24:40.311 --> 00:24:43.195]  This is the enemy's full assault, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:43.956 --> 00:24:45.017]  This is the next level.
[00:24:46.395 --> 00:24:50.635]   of the new world order. And you know, I aired an old piece we made like five years ago about
[00:24:50.635 --> 00:24:53.325]  body snatchers comparing to Democrats how crazy they are.
[00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:57.346]   But that's what it is. It's spirit snatchers. We're going to air that when we come back. And
[00:24:57.346 --> 00:24:59.036]  then I've got more clips of this.
[00:24:59.036 --> 00:25:02.475]   And then Elon Musk coming out saying he's going to stop the censorship at Twitter.
[00:25:02.475 --> 00:25:07.995]   A bunch of war news, a bunch of economic news, a bunch of the FBI got caught in a big false flag
[00:25:07.995 --> 00:25:11.995]   in Michigan. As you know, jury found folks non-guilty. This is such a huge deal. We've
[00:25:11.995 --> 00:25:15.274]   got a bunch of special guests, Ali Alexander and others coming up. Please stay with us.
[00:25:15.274 --> 00:25:23.434]   This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[00:25:23.683 --> 00:25:26.905]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread!
[00:25:27.005 --> 00:25:30.687]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[00:25:30.948 --> 00:25:32.929]  For beholden to scum!
[00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.669]  Russian scum!
[00:25:33.709 --> 00:25:33.969]  Listen.
[00:25:33.788 --> 00:25:34.788]  Mr. Sturrup!
[00:25:34.788 --> 00:25:42.788]  Listen. Please listen.
[00:25:42.788 --> 00:25:51.327]   If you don't, if you won't, if you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike
[00:25:51.327 --> 00:25:51.788]  in you!
[00:25:51.526 --> 00:25:54.488]  The function of all life is survival.
[00:25:55.769 --> 00:25:57.491]  Sleep.
[00:26:01.233 --> 00:26:01.634]  Oh my God!
[00:26:03.415 --> 00:26:03.855]  Lock the door!
[00:26:03.915 --> 00:26:04.496]  Lock the door!
[00:26:04.816 --> 00:26:05.777]  They're coming!
[00:26:07.398 --> 00:26:08.078]  They're coming!
[00:26:08.359 --> 00:26:08.539]  Help!
[00:26:08.639 --> 00:26:08.779]  Help!
[00:26:08.839 --> 00:26:09.379]  They're coming!
[00:26:09.399 --> 00:26:09.980]  They're coming!
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.420]  Listen to me!
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:10.740]  Listen!
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:11.181]  Help me!
[00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.730]  Alex, please!
[00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:13.410]  Please!
[00:26:13.651 --> 00:26:15.011]  Your legs are in danger!
[00:26:15.031 --> 00:26:16.051]  Please, listen to me!
[00:26:16.131 --> 00:26:17.272]  It's something terrible!
[00:26:17.432 --> 00:26:18.112]  Please!
[00:26:18.172 --> 00:26:20.513]  Your legs are in the air!
[00:26:20.793 --> 00:26:22.574]  They're already here!
[00:26:22.674 --> 00:26:22.834]  Help!
[00:26:22.874 --> 00:26:23.194]  Your legs!
[00:26:23.254 --> 00:26:23.754]  They're coming!
[00:26:23.834 --> 00:26:24.874]  They're coming!
[00:26:24.954 --> 00:26:25.715]  Sleep.
[00:26:25.795 --> 00:26:26.875]  The seed is planted.
[00:26:26.915 --> 00:26:27.675]  Sleep.
[00:26:28.876 --> 00:26:29.696]  Sleep.
[00:26:29.836 --> 00:26:30.856]  Terror grows.
[00:26:30.876 --> 00:26:30.976]  Sleep.
[00:26:31.056 --> 00:26:33.397]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[00:26:33.457 --> 00:26:34.558]  Get you when you sleep!
[00:26:34.578 --> 00:26:36.318]  Sit up!
[00:26:36.398 --> 00:26:38.599]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[00:26:40.064 --> 00:26:42.186]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites.
[00:26:42.266 --> 00:26:43.147]  Is it contagious?
[00:26:43.528 --> 00:26:45.570]  It looked right at me.
[00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:46.671]  You need to get out!
[00:26:46.691 --> 00:26:49.013]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[00:26:49.033 --> 00:26:50.034]  I'm not human.
[00:26:52.016 --> 00:26:55.119]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[00:26:55.159 --> 00:26:56.741]  We're being cornered!
[00:26:56.981 --> 00:26:59.524]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[00:26:59.403 --> 00:27:01.403]  of science fiction.
[00:27:01.403 --> 00:27:05.403]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[00:27:27.403 --> 00:27:31.403]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:27:32.144 --> 00:27:34.144]  It's Alice Jones.
[00:27:34.144 --> 00:27:53.144]  It's just the beginning.
[00:27:53.144 --> 00:28:03.144]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.061]  What they had planned for our little ones.
[00:27:57.009 --> 00:28:01.791]  I wish to raise a matter this afternoon for the attention of the Minister for Education.
[00:28:01.811 --> 00:28:05.352]  And I have to say, it is not often in this job I am absolutely shocked.
[00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:07.053]  I thought I'd seen everything.
[00:28:07.853 --> 00:28:12.114]  But this one is just beyond words.
[00:28:13.435 --> 00:28:20.457]  It is a note from a constituent who says, Hi Bernie, this is a worksheet that my 10-year-old daughter brought home from school.
[00:28:20.537 --> 00:28:22.078]  And it includes a photo of the worksheet.
[00:28:22.838 --> 00:28:29.991]   Part of her homework was to discuss with her father His erections and ejaculation.
[00:28:31.493 --> 00:28:35.318]  I find this very disturbing and sickening, as indeed do I, I have to say.
[00:28:36.627 --> 00:28:45.652]  What the hell is going on in this state when ten-year-old girls are told to go home and talk to your father about his erections and about his ejaculations?
[00:28:46.032 --> 00:28:47.573]  What the hell is going on here?
[00:28:47.973 --> 00:28:50.755]  We're delighted that the Family Sex Show will be on in May.
[00:28:50.815 --> 00:28:54.577]  I'm going to hand over to Josie, the Artistic Director of this egg, to say a little more.
[00:28:55.117 --> 00:29:01.341]  I run this egg and I have been making and producing the Family Sex Show along with lots of other people over the last few years.
[00:29:01.561 --> 00:29:06.804]  The Family Sex Show is a fun and playful show for adults and children aged 5 and up.
[00:29:07.104 --> 00:29:15.028]  It offers an honest, human sex education that is feminist, queer, non-binary, inclusive and sex positive.
[00:29:15.248 --> 00:29:22.392]  This show can allow audiences of all ages to feel confident about their bodies, their boundaries and their sexual health.
[00:29:22.572 --> 00:29:24.453]  And we really hope to see you here!
[00:29:25.133 --> 00:29:27.716]  So those of us that stand up for the little ones, they're going to be attacked.
[00:29:27.736 --> 00:29:28.716]  We're going to be demonized.
[00:29:28.756 --> 00:29:30.438]  We're going to be shot.
[00:29:30.478 --> 00:29:31.259]  We're going to be killed.
[00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:32.139]  We're going to be imprisoned.
[00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:33.220]  We're going to be tortured.
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:35.502]  We're going to be... A lot of things are going to happen to a lot of us.
[00:29:36.023 --> 00:29:41.147]  But at the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, God is watching and God is in control.
[00:29:41.167 --> 00:29:45.971]  And those evildoers carrying these wicked deeds out will pay.
[00:29:46.892 --> 00:29:54.419]  Ecclesiastes 1.18 is, For in much wisdom is much grief, and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow.
[00:29:54.959 --> 00:29:58.462]  I have much knowledge, and I have much sorrow.
[00:29:58.943 --> 00:29:59.944]  Much sorrow for thee.
[00:30:01.556 --> 00:30:04.097]  Hundreds of millions of innocent people starving to death right now.
[00:30:04.617 --> 00:30:06.838]  We're looking at 260 million people.
[00:30:07.419 --> 00:30:08.659]  And I'm not talking about hungry.
[00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:12.301]  I'm talking about marching towards starvation.
[00:30:12.641 --> 00:30:15.422]  And that is a catastrophe in itself.
[00:30:15.823 --> 00:30:22.686]  Lockdowns around the world have led to labor shortages, supply chain disruption, and a reduction in international trade.
[00:30:23.966 --> 00:30:24.467]  The result?
[00:30:24.887 --> 00:30:25.967]  Less available food.
[00:30:27.828 --> 00:30:29.269]  And less money to pay for it.
[00:30:31.753 --> 00:30:37.515]  It's a deadly combination and we've got to act now and we've got to be smart and we've got to thread the needle.
[00:30:38.015 --> 00:30:41.015]  You can't just deal with COVID by itself or hunger by itself.
[00:30:41.035 --> 00:30:43.636]  They must be dealt with together.
[00:30:43.976 --> 00:30:45.537]  If we do it right, we can save lives.
[00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:47.477]  If we don't do it right, people will die.
[00:30:48.077 --> 00:30:51.379]   We go to our football games and watch our Sitcoms.
[00:30:52.079 --> 00:31:02.085]  And then people that are living in pockets still of Western freedom, Western wealth, just go about their business, playing golf and tennis and having fun and going to movies.
[00:31:02.105 --> 00:31:08.450]  And as the water rises where those final islands of safety and security will finally be engulfed.
[00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:10.431]  But ignorance is bliss, right?
[00:31:10.971 --> 00:31:19.217]  But we are about to see the world we've known destroyed and on its ashes built a system designed to destroy the human that's made the image of God.
[00:31:20.145 --> 00:31:30.453]  It's a very painful thing to see the spirit of evil spreading its black wings over the earth and stinking its long stinking fangs into our children's very souls.
[00:31:31.074 --> 00:31:33.196]  But that is the price of consciousness and free will.
[00:31:33.396 --> 00:31:35.257]  For good is not the only thing in the universe.
[00:31:35.538 --> 00:31:36.939]  Evil dwells there as well.
[00:31:37.699 --> 00:31:43.304]  And it is when those good spirits do not stand up and fight for innocence that innocence is destroyed.
[00:31:44.225 --> 00:31:46.887]  And then the blood of the children is on our hands.
[00:31:51.407 --> 00:31:53.472]  We're live April 11, 2022.
[00:31:53.592 --> 00:31:54.354]  Big news coming up.
[00:31:54.454 --> 00:31:55.817]  It's called the Great Reset.
[00:31:56.559 --> 00:31:56.960]  Tough guy.
[00:31:58.232 --> 00:31:59.313]  It's called the New World Order.
[00:31:59.373 --> 00:32:09.378]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and a universal basic income.
[00:32:09.438 --> 00:32:10.479]  That's everything.
[00:32:10.759 --> 00:32:12.580]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:18.183]  The whole world's gonna be about surveillance and control and then manipulating and tracking everything you do.
[00:32:18.203 --> 00:32:19.664]  It's all being officially announced.
[00:32:19.684 --> 00:32:21.104]  I've got articles everywhere.
[00:32:21.144 --> 00:32:23.466]  There are press releases saying it!
[00:32:26.979 --> 00:32:29.320]  And the crew asked me during the break, they go, are you alright?
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.421]  You really seem upset.
[00:32:30.521 --> 00:32:31.442]  Are you feeling okay?
[00:32:31.562 --> 00:32:33.483]  Atlanta's about to have a nuclear war.
[00:32:33.503 --> 00:32:36.425]  I mean, they're gonna starve a couple hundred million people to death.
[00:32:36.485 --> 00:32:37.526]  Yeah, I'm pretty freaked out.
[00:32:37.546 --> 00:32:38.647]  Yeah, this is real.
[00:32:38.986 --> 00:32:42.986]  This is not a freaking game to me, man.
[00:32:42.986 --> 00:32:44.986]  [MUSIC]
[00:32:44.986 --> 00:32:46.986]  You understand, I like living, right?
[00:32:46.986 --> 00:32:48.986]  I like living.
[00:32:48.986 --> 00:32:50.986]  [MUSIC]
[00:32:50.986 --> 00:32:53.986]  People are starting to have hundreds of millions right now.
[00:32:54.147 --> 00:32:55.608]  You know, you never see it on the news.
[00:32:55.648 --> 00:32:57.249]  They're dying right now.
[00:32:57.409 --> 00:33:08.856]  They're in their freaking houses, starving to death, begging for God to help them, and no one's coming because God tells us to get up and take action, and then we don't do anything!
[00:33:08.936 --> 00:33:11.737]  And that paralyzes God!
[00:33:11.777 --> 00:33:12.658]  Yeah, God can do it.
[00:33:14.119 --> 00:33:24.887]  Once again, not for the first time, what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be true.
[00:33:25.388 --> 00:33:27.950]  I'm really freaked out!
[00:33:32.373 --> 00:33:34.234]  You see, because this is real!
[00:33:34.695 --> 00:33:38.578]  The supply chain being cut off, the energy grid being cut off is real!
[00:33:41.729 --> 00:33:44.771]  And we're going into a time now where we're not going to be on the air.
[00:33:44.871 --> 00:33:51.955]  I mean, if we don't back this off, if we don't get sane people to stop the globalists, I mean, we won't be here in six months.
[00:33:52.195 --> 00:34:01.621]  You won't be here in six months.
[00:34:03.001 --> 00:34:06.003]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[00:34:06.163 --> 00:34:06.984]  InfoWars.com.
[00:34:07.024 --> 00:34:08.004]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:34:08.104 --> 00:34:08.805]  InfoWars.com.
[00:34:10.203 --> 00:34:10.984]  InfoWars.
[00:34:11.024 --> 00:34:11.965]  You watch InfoWars?
[00:34:12.185 --> 00:34:13.026]  InfoWars.
[00:34:13.086 --> 00:34:15.348]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:34:15.508 --> 00:34:16.109]  Alex Jones.
[00:34:16.169 --> 00:34:16.689]  Nice guy.
[00:34:16.709 --> 00:34:19.272]  You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:34:19.432 --> 00:34:20.073]  Alex Jones.
[00:34:21.754 --> 00:34:22.455]  Alex Jones.
[00:34:22.555 --> 00:34:23.196]  Alex Jones.
[00:34:23.276 --> 00:34:24.477]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[00:34:24.537 --> 00:34:25.558]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[00:34:25.578 --> 00:34:26.779]  Quit playing this joke over here.
[00:34:26.959 --> 00:34:28.340]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[00:34:28.461 --> 00:34:31.804]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:34:31.684 --> 00:34:34.884]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:34:34.884 --> 00:34:44.884]  [MUSIC]
[00:34:45.684 --> 00:34:55.684]  [MUSIC]
[00:34:55.684 --> 00:35:05.684]  [MUSIC]
[00:35:05.684 --> 00:35:21.564]   Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to this live April 11th, Monday, 2022 transmission.
[00:35:21.564 --> 00:35:31.564]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:35:23.066 --> 00:35:36.096]  Now he'll be with us 30 minutes to the next hour, and I'm just going to try to give him the floor because I always liked Ali Alexander, interviewed him like five, six years ago, then got to be friends with him during the last Trump campaign and then during the Stop the Steal.
[00:35:37.097 --> 00:35:43.762]  But he really is, with all the lawyers I know and all the really smart politicos, he's been the most right all along.
[00:35:43.802 --> 00:35:45.703]  I really respect him.
[00:35:45.723 --> 00:35:50.767]  I always liked him, but I really respect him now because he gives me insights that I didn't have that end up being right.
[00:35:51.027 --> 00:35:55.335]   And that's what I really respect is people that are Smarter than me in some aspects.
[00:35:55.375 --> 00:35:57.381]  We're all smarter than each other in certain ways.
[00:35:57.401 --> 00:35:58.825]  There's different types of IQs, but...
[00:36:00.128 --> 00:36:03.769]  And he's had the courage to go in front of the congressional committees that are trying to set you up.
[00:36:03.889 --> 00:36:04.589]  I didn't even do it.
[00:36:04.949 --> 00:36:05.489]  I took the fifth.
[00:36:05.949 --> 00:36:06.950]  Not because I have anything to hide.
[00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:09.890]  I know they lie and are super sophisticated and smart.
[00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.431]  He did it and really had a huge victory.
[00:36:13.311 --> 00:36:14.691]  And now he's, quote, cooperating.
[00:36:14.711 --> 00:36:16.312]  Well, they've subpoenaed him for a grand jury.
[00:36:16.332 --> 00:36:17.272]  You have to cooperate.
[00:36:17.732 --> 00:36:19.192]  It doesn't mean he's, like, making stuff up.
[00:36:20.013 --> 00:36:29.295]  But the Whitmer case coming out, the not guilty and the mistrials, is the same FBI agents ran that operation that were running the Capitol operation.
[00:36:29.955 --> 00:36:36.003]  And the idea that they're trying to frame Ali Alexander and myself for this is a big, big deal.
[00:36:36.684 --> 00:36:39.588]  And I can't talk about Justice Department things that are going on with me right now.
[00:36:40.909 --> 00:36:42.451]  They've asked us not to at this point.
[00:36:43.633 --> 00:36:45.335]  But it's very substantive.
[00:36:46.467 --> 00:36:57.135]  I mean, let's just say main prosecutors are involved, and so there's some things we can do, some things we can't, but it's a very serious situation.
[00:36:57.435 --> 00:36:59.717]  So listeners go, hey, we don't want to hear about January 6th.
[00:36:59.737 --> 00:37:02.839]  They tune out and talk about it, because they know it wasn't pre-planned.
[00:37:02.899 --> 00:37:04.120]  They know I weren't involved.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:12.927]  They know the Democrats burned down billions of dollars of stuff and did all this, and then a thousand people went into the Capitol, only 200 or so attacked the cops.
[00:37:12.987 --> 00:37:14.048]  Okay, give them a jail sentence.
[00:37:14.668 --> 00:37:25.939]  But the fact that we're in martial law and civil war and all Republicans are evil and Mitch McConnell should be outlawed, even Joe Biden said a few months ago the whole party's bad and we're gonna have a... This is BS!
[00:37:27.264 --> 00:37:29.545]  Well, Hunter Biden and his laptop and the rest of it's out there.
[00:37:29.565 --> 00:37:31.946]  So I'm going to shut up and give Ali Alexander the floor here.
[00:37:32.486 --> 00:37:44.830]  But this is a big deal because they're running on the midterms in 211 days on January 6, and they need to prove a fake connection from the protesters.
[00:37:46.733 --> 00:37:56.779]  Up into the Proud Boys, and the Oath Keepers, and into myself and Ali Alexander, and then into the people that organized the peaceful rally, up into the Trump administration.
[00:37:56.819 --> 00:37:57.059]  Trump.
[00:37:57.159 --> 00:37:58.140]  And it's a fraud.
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:05.124]  So our listeners laugh because they know it's a fraud, but it's not a fraud because they are betting all their chips on this.
[00:38:05.604 --> 00:38:07.245]  Ali Alexander, sorry I got you on late.
[00:38:07.285 --> 00:38:08.626]  Had a bunch of emergencies around here.
[00:38:08.926 --> 00:38:09.527]  Thank you so much.
[00:38:10.936 --> 00:38:12.017]  Hey, it's breaking news.
[00:38:12.037 --> 00:38:12.757]  I understand it.
[00:38:12.817 --> 00:38:14.198]  I mean, you're exactly right.
[00:38:14.779 --> 00:38:25.206]  And what our listeners need to understand is that essentially our activities, and I apologize for the bad Wi-Fi, but our activities are covered by the First Amendment.
[00:38:25.826 --> 00:38:41.959]   What the Democrats and the deep state are attempting to do is to take away those speech protections by saying, We incited something or there was a grand conspiracy or the talking point now from the Democrats was that there was a self-coup.
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:55.790]  If they do this, what happens is that they will use you or me or some of our associates to say, well, this was Trump's connection to the Proud Boys or this was Trump's connection to the Oath Keepers.
[00:38:56.110 --> 00:39:03.734]   So what listeners need to understand that, you know, in legal matters, when you're Constructing a conspiracy case.
[00:39:04.254 --> 00:39:09.236]  They can't just hop from the violent elements to Trump, which is their real goal.
[00:39:09.636 --> 00:39:12.477]  What they need to do is that they need some in-between.
[00:39:12.817 --> 00:39:15.458]  And they need to allege something happened that didn't happen.
[00:39:15.938 --> 00:39:19.899]  You know, I didn't coordinate with the Proud Boys on January 6th.
[00:39:19.979 --> 00:39:24.621]  And I'm also not presuming that any of them are guilty of, frankly, anything.
[00:39:25.261 --> 00:39:30.414]   And, you know, we did allow the Oath Keepers To be ushers for my event.
[00:39:30.655 --> 00:39:32.376]  But I ran none of that by you.
[00:39:32.537 --> 00:39:34.118]  I ran none of that by your team.
[00:39:34.378 --> 00:39:41.085]  But this is what the Department of Justice and Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and the rest of them are doing.
[00:39:41.165 --> 00:39:47.592]  So, you know, months ago I came on your air, Alex, and a lot of my friends were telling me, Ali, this is dying down.
[00:39:47.632 --> 00:39:48.833]  The public's not buying it.
[00:39:49.213 --> 00:39:53.176]  I said, I know, but they're putting all of their chips in this basket.
[00:39:53.196 --> 00:39:54.857]  Look, I'll just be honest with you.
[00:39:54.877 --> 00:39:57.539]  I'm going to say this because I'm not CIA, okay?
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:01.082]  The CIA is one of the biggest agencies in the U.S., but we have high-level sources.
[00:40:01.642 --> 00:40:06.245]  We were told four months ago, watch out, the Justice Department's coming, the next phase.
[00:40:06.265 --> 00:40:12.670]  We were told everything by the CIA, and I'm just going to leave it at that, because there's an internal civil war going on, and that was our CIA contact.
[00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:14.711]  That doesn't mean the whole CIA is like this.
[00:40:14.751 --> 00:40:26.478]  I'm just getting it out there that the CIA said phase two is tying all the people that organize rallies to Trump and claiming that Trump and that the rally organizers were running the Proud Boys and that, which is preposterous.
[00:40:26.498 --> 00:40:27.058]  Please continue.
[00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:29.260]  No, you're right.
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:35.703]  And that's what the listeners need to understand, too, is that there is a civil war going on in the intelligence community.
[00:40:37.534 --> 00:40:47.863]  If listeners will remember, there was July or August of last year, there was a Reuters article that exonerated you, exonerated Roger Stone, right in the headline.
[00:40:48.263 --> 00:40:51.205]  In the body, it also exonerated people like me.
[00:40:51.225 --> 00:40:54.728]  So it said, rally organizers, speakers, blah, blah, blah.
[00:40:54.948 --> 00:40:56.590]  There's no investigation of these people.
[00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:58.131]  It's protected by the First Amendment.
[00:40:59.072 --> 00:41:00.713]  You know, there's no connection between them.
[00:41:01.153 --> 00:41:03.975]  And some of the violent elements of the riot.
[00:41:04.375 --> 00:41:09.519]  Or, you know, as you see, Ray Epps and other people who look like they did it in a premeditated way.
[00:41:09.859 --> 00:41:12.061]  You know, we're not associated with any of those agitators.
[00:41:12.441 --> 00:41:21.467]  But what was happening was that was the FBI so fed up with some of the political elements of the DOJ that they said, we got to get this evidence public.
[00:41:21.507 --> 00:41:23.589]  We got to get this evidence in the public.
[00:41:23.949 --> 00:41:33.960]   Well, what happened is instead of the rest of the press kind of celebrating, That we didn't organize some self-coup or insurrection or violent riot.
[00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:36.601]  The press tried to be mum on it, okay?
[00:41:36.961 --> 00:41:38.562]  And this was really, really dangerous.
[00:41:38.582 --> 00:41:42.684]  So what happened is those elements of the FBI largely got pushed out.
[00:41:43.324 --> 00:41:54.910]  And so when Merrick Garland, on the anniversary of January 6th, started trying to do a mea culpa with the January 6th committee and meeting them halfway, said, we're going to follow the money and we're going to restart new investigations.
[00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:59.543]   That was the beginning of Our hellscape round two.
[00:42:00.024 --> 00:42:05.148]  And so unfortunately, the Department of Justice contacted my lawyers about a month ago.
[00:42:05.168 --> 00:42:09.971]  They said that we don't want, we're not going to ask Ali to voluntarily cooperate.
[00:42:10.011 --> 00:42:10.952]  We're going to subpoena him.
[00:42:11.352 --> 00:42:12.133]  You better come in.
[00:42:12.173 --> 00:42:13.614]  You better give us some information.
[00:42:14.314 --> 00:42:16.516]  I let them know what the rules of the road are.
[00:42:17.057 --> 00:42:20.299]  And by the way, Ali, as you know, I'm not ready to announce it.
[00:42:20.339 --> 00:42:21.080]  That's been going on.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.561]  We're on parallel tracks here.
[00:42:24.045 --> 00:42:29.086]  What's happening to you is happening to me and I'm just, I don't know how to respond to it at this point because it's so ridiculous.
[00:42:29.106 --> 00:42:29.646]  Please continue.
[00:42:30.687 --> 00:42:38.628]  And Alex, a lot of people are stuck in this position that I'm in, that you're in, and you know, Trump allies and Trump detractors.
[00:42:38.988 --> 00:42:40.209]  I just happen to be the first one.
[00:42:40.489 --> 00:42:40.849]  I got it.
[00:42:40.949 --> 00:42:49.851]  I got to tell you, I feel like I'm the first one out of the gate and I'm going to get shot because what happens when you're like me and the Justice Department tells you, don't admit that this is happening.
[00:42:50.251 --> 00:42:51.312]  And then you go and admit it.
[00:42:51.332 --> 00:42:54.714]  You're not violating any law, but they can charge you with a crime.
[00:42:54.774 --> 00:42:57.535]  Well, I want to talk about your courage, because I've been advised not to talk about it.
[00:42:57.995 --> 00:43:00.437]  You were the first to go to the committee in the lion's den.
[00:43:00.757 --> 00:43:04.639]  You're the first to go along and admit it's happening, and they spin it like you're cooperating.
[00:43:04.959 --> 00:43:06.460]  No, you're standing up against the lie.
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.341]  You're a hero, and I mean that.
[00:43:09.562 --> 00:43:10.822]  Well, I don't think I'm a hero.
[00:43:10.842 --> 00:43:12.023]  You're afraid to talk to them?
[00:43:12.043 --> 00:43:15.025]  Just my memory's not perfect, and they'll try to twist something.
[00:43:16.616 --> 00:43:17.556]  That's exactly it.
[00:43:17.756 --> 00:43:22.838]  It's like, why would they wait a year and a half to ask us logistical details?
[00:43:22.878 --> 00:43:24.899]  That's all the information that you and I have.
[00:43:25.139 --> 00:43:35.894]   And so I've handed over my text messages and they show minute by minute our real-time shock and awe, dismay, and then de-escalation, and then retreat
[00:43:35.894 --> 00:43:41.774]   from the area as not to act as magnets for the riots. And, you know, I'm so grateful that one of
[00:43:41.774 --> 00:43:47.443]   the J6 defendants just recently got off because a judge said, "No, he was waived in by COP." You
[00:43:47.443 --> 00:43:49.774]  know, and so the press is beating me up.
[00:43:49.993 --> 00:43:51.853]  You know, why won't you denounce these people?
[00:43:51.893 --> 00:43:53.394]  Why won't you denounce these people?
[00:43:53.654 --> 00:43:55.434]  The Justice Department is hanging it over my head.
[00:43:55.474 --> 00:43:57.915]  You know, they want these one words.
[00:43:57.935 --> 00:44:01.296]  You know, they want us to perform an act of Judas, Alex.
[00:44:01.616 --> 00:44:05.977]  They want you or me to say that we predicted violence when we didn't.
[00:44:06.077 --> 00:44:06.437]  Why?
[00:44:06.737 --> 00:44:09.178]  Because that's an element they need for a conspiracy case.
[00:44:09.378 --> 00:44:13.719]  They want you or I to say that we talked to the White House about militia groups.
[00:44:14.119 --> 00:44:15.900]  I didn't talk to the White House about militia groups.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.282]  I don't think you talked to the White House about militia groups.
[00:44:18.582 --> 00:44:20.903]  This is all a setup, but guess what?
[00:44:21.223 --> 00:44:27.327]  Our text messages, our emails, our movements, and the videos of that day that we've made public, they exonerate us.
[00:44:27.587 --> 00:44:28.808]  There was no insurrection.
[00:44:29.228 --> 00:44:29.508]  I agree.
[00:44:29.327 --> 00:44:33.527]   Let's come back next hour to talk about big picture, what happened with the Whitmer fake
[00:44:33.527 --> 00:44:35.527]  prosecution false flag and plowing, how big it is.
[00:44:35.527 --> 00:44:39.288]   But I want to explain for listeners, I know you get this, but this isn't about January
[00:44:39.288 --> 00:44:40.288]  6th now.
[00:44:40.288 --> 00:44:42.086]  It's not about Ali Alexander, Alex Jones or Trump.
[00:44:42.086 --> 00:44:46.007]   It's about they're framing all Americans as terrorists and saying a revolution is about
[00:44:46.007 --> 00:44:48.248]  to happen in a civil war based on this.
[00:44:48.248 --> 00:44:49.728]  And we don't want violence.
[00:44:49.728 --> 00:44:51.288]  And we're not about to stage something.
[00:44:51.288 --> 00:44:53.327]  And we're not revolutionary violent leaders.
[00:44:53.327 --> 00:44:54.768]  We are thought leaders.
[00:44:54.768 --> 00:44:56.047]  And that's why this is so important.
[00:44:56.047 --> 00:44:59.206]   Because even though we've all moved past it and we're sick of it, believe me, I'm sick
[00:44:59.408 --> 00:45:05.287]   of it. I know listeners are sick of it. The Democrats are betting everything on this number
[00:45:05.287 --> 00:45:09.568]   on the roulette wheel, which means they're going to pull false flags or something big.
[00:45:09.568 --> 00:45:13.087]   Ali Alexander, you're one of the most banned people in the world for standing up for freedom.
[00:45:13.087 --> 00:45:16.408]   Where's the best place for people to find all the great work you do?
[00:45:16.408 --> 00:45:21.408]   On Telegram, Ali Alexander. I'm also on Truth Socialist, Ali.
[00:45:21.408 --> 00:45:22.888]  All right, stay there.
[00:45:23.474 --> 00:45:30.860]  I'm going to come back in two minutes and I'm going to try to just, we'll get into Whitmer, we'll get into the false flags, we'll get into where this is going straight ahead.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:35.403]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:45:35.463 --> 00:45:40.547]  It's the last days, by the way, we need funding, of the Infowars mega blowout sale.
[00:45:40.607 --> 00:45:43.449]  Only three days left on our top selling products at Infowars, 75% off.
[00:45:45.239 --> 00:45:50.242]  All right, the next two segments, I'm going to shut up you, Ali Alexander, to the floor, cover any topic he wants.
[00:45:50.643 --> 00:45:54.425]  No convictions for FBI-directed white supremacist Whitmer kidnapping suspects acquitted.
[00:45:54.905 --> 00:45:57.347]  Grand jury deadlocked in political prosecution.
[00:45:57.407 --> 00:46:02.330]  It's called another famous, the most famous, FBI-provocateur operation ever.
[00:46:02.471 --> 00:46:04.132]  In fact, some stations join this next segment.
[00:46:04.452 --> 00:46:06.573]  We should probably hit that now, but Ali, you've got the floor.
[00:46:07.134 --> 00:46:14.979]  I'm going to just shut up this segment and the next, so don't pause, because I'm going to let you talk about just all of this, because I'm telling you, when I talk to you on the phone, I just sit there and listen because it's so on target.
[00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:17.601]  No, no.
[00:46:17.661 --> 00:46:20.383]  I mean, Alex, like, you know, I couldn't do this without you.
[00:46:20.703 --> 00:46:34.994]  But look, I mean, what we know about the FBI case in Michigan is that they moved the guy who was in charge and really set up that plot to cover for her killing all those elderly people in nursing homes.
[00:46:35.014 --> 00:46:38.576]  So they created this to try to give her a more national profile.
[00:46:38.896 --> 00:46:44.916]   They created this stupid coup in Michigan, and then they move that guy over to Washington
[00:46:44.916 --> 00:46:47.155]  to oversee the January 6th cases.
[00:46:47.155 --> 00:46:54.675]   So what we've learned is that J. Edgar Hoover's FBI is worse than when it was during Hoover.
[00:46:54.675 --> 00:47:00.277]   And because of 9/11, the laws are so flimsily that the FBI can set up anything, can allege
[00:47:00.277 --> 00:47:02.516]  anything, and then it becomes true.
[00:47:02.516 --> 00:47:07.456]   And then what's worse, what's worse is that the people have become suspicious of each
[00:47:07.456 --> 00:47:09.436]  other because we've been programmed.
[00:47:09.758 --> 00:47:20.083]  So you or I could not get a fair trial in New York City or Washington DC, but liberals could get a fair trial in Texas or in Florida.
[00:47:20.363 --> 00:47:22.845]  And so we really live in this two-tiered system.
[00:47:23.165 --> 00:47:31.769]   So when people like you or me or Roger Stone or Steve Bannon are going through some of these Uh, these legal quandaries, people are like, well, why are they doing that?
[00:47:31.789 --> 00:47:32.930]  Well, why are they doing that?
[00:47:33.310 --> 00:47:36.791]  Not understanding that we know we didn't commit a crime.
[00:47:37.372 --> 00:47:39.993]  We know that they can fabricate a charge.
[00:47:40.313 --> 00:47:44.835]  And then usually a fabricated charge can't survive a conviction.
[00:47:44.875 --> 00:47:48.176]  Thank God in this FBI case in Michigan, it didn't.
[00:47:48.854 --> 00:47:55.220]  But where we're looking in Washington, D.C., we can absolutely be convicted by a D.C.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:59.423]  judge who wants a special appointment from the Biden administration or a D.C.
[00:47:59.483 --> 00:48:04.347]  jury that has been told that we tried to hurt their children and hurt their spouses.
[00:48:04.768 --> 00:48:07.991]  I mean, we're really living at the end of the republic.
[00:48:08.451 --> 00:48:19.322]   And what we got to do as patriots is be safe, be smart, Stay in prayer and be very mindful about what we say and what we mean because, you know, I want to affirm 1776.
[00:48:19.882 --> 00:48:43.838]   I want to affirm the Second Amendment and yet the DOJ wants to weaponize terms like that and they want to weaponize messages like that and say, okay, well now you're going to jail or now you're part of a federal criminal conspiracy because of one of your supporters did X, Y, or Z. And so we live in a preposterous time but folks need to realize We're on a three part track to stop Trump from running in 2024.
[00:48:44.239 --> 00:48:50.508]  There's the J6 commission committee, there's the DOJ investigation, and then there's the civil cases.
[00:48:50.548 --> 00:48:52.030]  You just saw Judge Carter.
[00:48:52.790 --> 00:49:02.520]  He wrote this ridiculous opinion where he said that Donald Trump was likely in charge of a criminal conspiracy to overthrow the government.
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:04.722]  He threw the J6 committee a bone.
[00:49:05.102 --> 00:49:10.428]  The J6 committee then throws the DOJ a bone and says, if you don't charge him, then we'll criminally refer him.
[00:49:10.888 --> 00:49:13.371]  So, you know, we just live in a preposterous time.
[00:49:13.671 --> 00:49:18.055]  They're running the last part of their coup because they don't want more elections.
[00:49:18.075 --> 00:49:19.437]  They don't want a Republican Party.
[00:49:19.477 --> 00:49:20.658]  They don't want Christians.
[00:49:20.898 --> 00:49:25.303]  They want to implode us and they want to usher us in to a stateless new world order.
[00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.153]  You said it absolutely perfectly, and they even admit that.
[00:49:29.173 --> 00:49:30.574]  We're going to come back in one minute.
[00:49:30.594 --> 00:49:32.075]  I want you to continue for two segments.
[00:49:32.196 --> 00:49:45.969]  Ollie Alexander, who's been totally vindicated and the only guy that's had the courage to testify to the feds and to the J6 committee, and they're just totally upset and don't know what to do because we did nothing.
[00:49:46.009 --> 00:49:50.894]  We were there, and it was the federal stand-down of police and military that allowed this to happen.
[00:49:52.850 --> 00:50:06.562]  Well, Ali Alexander is a Republican political analysis expert, analyst, campaign manager, you name it, and he helped run Stop the Steal, standing up and challenging election results.
[00:50:07.082 --> 00:50:12.367]  Now, whether he was right or wrong, and he was certainly right, and we've seen the evidence, that's his right as an American to do that.
[00:50:13.087 --> 00:50:15.588]  There's a clip I've got here in the stack.
[00:50:15.628 --> 00:50:16.348]  I forget where it's at.
[00:50:16.388 --> 00:50:17.288]  Guys, tell me where it is.
[00:50:17.868 --> 00:50:19.149]  Because there's like 50 clips here.
[00:50:19.169 --> 00:50:19.969]  I forget which number it is.
[00:50:20.289 --> 00:50:24.570]  Where Hillary's like, Democrats are having elections stolen from them by Republicans.
[00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:26.290]  With electronic machines.
[00:50:26.871 --> 00:50:45.832]   But she can say that, but simultaneously, but simultaneously, if Trump says that, or you say that, or I say that, like here's a clip, well then, If we say that, then we are the bad people, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:46.132 --> 00:50:48.954]  So they're allowed to say it, but we're not allowed to say it.
[00:50:49.615 --> 00:50:50.095]  Here it is.
[00:50:50.135 --> 00:50:50.876]  Here's the crime.
[00:50:51.096 --> 00:50:58.762]  Ali, Alexander, Alex Jones, Donald Trump, Rudolph Giuliani, Trump Jr.
[00:50:59.883 --> 00:51:01.985]  Everybody's bad because we're doing what she does.
[00:51:02.025 --> 00:51:02.365]  Here it is.
[00:51:04.106 --> 00:51:05.648]  You can run the best campaign.
[00:51:06.769 --> 00:51:08.130]  You can even become the nominee.
[00:51:09.591 --> 00:51:11.652]  And you can have the election stolen from you.
[00:51:16.114 --> 00:51:25.258]  Ali Alexander, take it over with the Whitmer false flag plot, Michigan exposed and the not guilty and hung jury with all this.
[00:51:25.298 --> 00:51:27.039]  This is just insane to be watching.
[00:51:27.079 --> 00:51:27.659]  Please continue.
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:32.821]  Yeah, I think I really do think this is the end of the Republic.
[00:51:33.001 --> 00:51:36.783]  And I think, you know, CNN did a segment on me this weekend.
[00:51:37.478 --> 00:51:43.199]  And they actually kind of soberly laid out the case that I wasn't cooperating with the Feds.
[00:51:43.639 --> 00:51:45.040]  They said, don't get your hopes up.
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:47.160]  They said, this is an eccentric character.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:49.201]  He says wild things on InfoWars.
[00:51:49.621 --> 00:51:53.242]  And then they said, you know, he would never be a witness against Trump.
[00:51:53.502 --> 00:51:58.483]  So what the Feds are obviously doing, because they subpoenaed him and he's not, and he didn't come involuntary.
[00:51:58.962 --> 00:52:04.505]  Is that they're probing him for information that may lead to, you know, other people, blah, blah, blah.
[00:52:04.525 --> 00:52:11.528]  And I thought, wow, there's my enemies, at least kind of very soberly trying to let down their audience's excitement.
[00:52:11.848 --> 00:52:15.630]  But in all of that, I really feel like this is the end of the Republican.
[00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:16.590]  I shouldn't say that.
[00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:18.291]  I should be excited about the red wave.
[00:52:18.611 --> 00:52:23.353]  But Alex, it wasn't conservative media that solved the Whitmore case.
[00:52:23.773 --> 00:52:25.274]  It was BuzzFeed News.
[00:52:26.154 --> 00:52:27.295]  I mean, let me say that again.
[00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:40.158]  BuzzFeed News is the news organization, it's not even a news organization, that exonerated and exposed the FBI plot in that state kidnapping case.
[00:52:40.278 --> 00:52:44.960]  Without BuzzFeed News, there would be injustice and those guys would have gone to jail.
[00:52:45.461 --> 00:52:48.042]  And so, where the hell is conservative media?
[00:52:48.562 --> 00:52:49.963]  Where are the protests?
[00:52:50.626 --> 00:53:00.414]  You know, the RNC raised $250 million off the movement that was coined by Roger Stone, ran by me, and fueled by you.
[00:53:00.834 --> 00:53:02.836]  They raised $250 million.
[00:53:03.216 --> 00:53:04.697]  No one's paying for my lawyers.
[00:53:05.237 --> 00:53:06.779]  No one's paying for your lawyers.
[00:53:07.339 --> 00:53:12.323]  You know, all of that money went to go buy bagels for Ron and Romney McDaniel.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:18.207]  Liz Cheney just announced that she raised $2.9 million in a quarter.
[00:53:18.928 --> 00:53:28.282]  She's gone from raising a couple hundred thousand dollars to $2.9 million in a state that does not have a million people.
[00:53:29.235 --> 00:53:35.858]  And she's going to get Democrats to vote for her in the primary so that she runs a coup and stays there.
[00:53:36.158 --> 00:53:45.801]  She has said that it is her number one priority to make sure that Donald Trump does not reenter the White House by any means necessary.
[00:53:46.482 --> 00:53:54.594]   I mean, Alex, we're at the end of the Republic and We need a miracle.
[00:53:54.854 --> 00:53:59.456]  I think that's what I'm saying, that there's hope in Jesus Christ, but there's not hope in the Republican Party.
[00:53:59.996 --> 00:54:02.157]  There's not hope in the conservative movement.
[00:54:02.738 --> 00:54:06.059]  Nobody's doing any organizing, all of us who are de-platformed.
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:15.164]  And then, you know, Alex, I know that you work really, really hard, you know, at your job in media, but then the rest of your day is spent with lawyers.
[00:54:16.018 --> 00:54:18.419]  You know, and they mean to break us down.
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:22.042]  They mean to demoralize us because they want us to bear false testimony.
[00:54:22.242 --> 00:54:24.463]  There wasn't an insurrection on January 6th.
[00:54:24.743 --> 00:54:25.484]  I'm sorry.
[00:54:25.984 --> 00:54:29.186]  Trump didn't direct us to start a violent militia.
[00:54:29.226 --> 00:54:30.787]  We weren't coordinating with violent militias.
[00:54:30.827 --> 00:54:33.529]  And I frankly, I don't even think that there are militias there.
[00:54:33.749 --> 00:54:35.710]  You know, there are people LARPing and stuff like that.
[00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:45.221]   But anyway, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm kind of frustrated and rambling, but, but, but dude, This all seems to serve the great reset.
[00:54:45.361 --> 00:54:52.810]  I think that if you take down America, the world questions whether or not there can be nation states.
[00:54:53.090 --> 00:54:54.812]  So I think this is all part of their plan.
[00:54:55.012 --> 00:54:56.414]  We're watching it in real time.
[00:54:56.634 --> 00:54:59.658]  We find ourselves as characters in this dystopian novel.
[00:55:00.208 --> 00:55:07.090]  And it's really freaky that there are our neighbors, even if they're Democrats, that are willing to cooperate with this insanity.
[00:55:07.130 --> 00:55:12.011]  They look at our text messages and the videos of us pulling people away from the Capitol steps.
[00:55:12.491 --> 00:55:18.673]  Or, you know, they look at the text messages of the would-be FBI kidnappers.
[00:55:18.913 --> 00:55:22.294]  And these guys are just talking about beers and women and shooting.
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:26.862]  We are not the monsters that they think we are.
[00:55:27.102 --> 00:55:31.024]  You know, the right wing has never been the monsters that they think we are.
[00:55:31.084 --> 00:55:32.185]  They're the eugenicists.
[00:55:32.245 --> 00:55:33.226]  They're the murderers.
[00:55:33.526 --> 00:55:34.707]  They're the baby killers.
[00:55:34.747 --> 00:55:35.828]  They're the pedophiles.
[00:55:36.188 --> 00:55:38.229]  They're the people who send people to war.
[00:55:38.489 --> 00:55:43.713]  And yet, every generation through the Hegelian dialectic, they just change it and relabel it as us.
[00:55:43.973 --> 00:55:44.994]  Right-wing fascists.
[00:55:45.394 --> 00:55:46.395]  They're the fascists.
[00:55:46.435 --> 00:55:49.337]  So, you know, it's extremely frustrating.
[00:55:49.697 --> 00:56:00.325]   But, like, thank God, you know, you lend your platform to me that I can be able to talk because What they do is they sod me, then they make up a lie about me, and I can't respond.
[00:56:00.485 --> 00:56:01.546]  I'm not allowed on Twitter.
[00:56:01.566 --> 00:56:03.167]  I'm not allowed to talk to media.
[00:56:03.367 --> 00:56:04.787]  Conservative media doesn't care.
[00:56:05.108 --> 00:56:06.929]  Well, that's really the big issue, isn't it?
[00:56:07.009 --> 00:56:12.031]  That they demonize us, they lie about us, and we can't respond, so it just makes them more insane.
[00:56:12.071 --> 00:56:20.536]  What do you think of Elon Musk buying 9.2% and now saying he wants to turn Twitter headquarters in San Francisco into a homeless shelter and challenging them?
[00:56:20.556 --> 00:56:21.977]  Because I think it's overdue.
[00:56:22.677 --> 00:56:28.761]  You know, a lot of my supporters say, well, trust Elon Musk or not.
[00:56:29.021 --> 00:56:39.968]  And I'm like, that's not the standard reason that we were getting it.
[00:56:39.988 --> 00:56:46.472]  Especially, you know, Jesus said, you'll know them by their... So, what you don't do is, you don't put your trust or your faith in any man.
[00:56:47.219 --> 00:56:48.580]  You just know them by their teeth.
[00:56:48.921 --> 00:56:51.924]  And so temporary alliances are perfectly fine.
[00:56:52.404 --> 00:56:54.666]  And never stop your opponents when they're fighting.
[00:56:55.087 --> 00:57:06.657]  You know, this is essentially, um, this was, uh, during World War II, they had Japan and the United States fighting because they were scared that they were going to intertrap them, okay?
[00:57:07.558 --> 00:57:15.972]   What we need to do is, Elon Musk is more All your your Skype was was bad before now it's unintelligible,
[00:57:15.972 --> 00:57:20.212]   but you're saying incredibly important things stay there Let's reconnect with Ali Alexander
[00:57:20.212 --> 00:57:25.253]   We're gonna come back to him for one more segment to talk about the Whitmer plot and so much more as the wheels come
[00:57:25.253 --> 00:57:27.572]   off the globalist
[00:57:27.572 --> 00:57:35.152]   Just departments move to label and demonize all Americans that are in opposition to the takeover of our
[00:57:35.152 --> 00:57:40.212]   country as terrorists, but I didn't plug last hour Let me plug this hour, and I'm just gonna be point-blank
[00:57:40.212 --> 00:57:44.271]   with listeners. We're not bringing in the money We need right now to operate. I'm not bitching. It's fine.
[00:57:44.271 --> 00:57:47.411]   I love you But we need your support
[00:57:47.003 --> 00:57:48.364]  I'm asking you humbly.

[00:58:19.417 --> 00:58:20.577]  That sale ends in like a week.

[00:59:25.935 --> 00:59:28.596]  We are the tip of the spear, and without you, we're going to be shut down.
[00:59:28.676 --> 00:59:30.417]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:59:30.437 --> 00:59:31.898]  I want to ask you to redouble your efforts now.
[00:59:33.522 --> 00:59:47.089]  Imagine a million people gather together in the nation's capital on January 6, 2021, to protest an election that's been done many times in American history.
[00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:50.551]  And a few hundred attack police.
[00:59:51.031 --> 00:59:53.533]  The police stand down and wave in a thousand or so.
[00:59:54.353 --> 01:00:08.137]   And then we're told it's the greatest attack on America, bigger than 9-11, and as important As Pearl Harbor, what an insult to people that died on 9-11 and at Pearl Harbor under real attack.
[01:00:09.077 --> 01:00:09.978]  Unbelievable.
[01:00:10.038 --> 01:00:25.425]  And we're not happy about what happened for the police officer that died later and the five patriots that died or Ashley Babbitt, but to have them then try to frame this as the biggest event in world history and then demonize those of us that were just peacefully promoting rallies for years.
[01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:40.070]  And months before, for Trump and protesting, to say that we are prime suspects in this vaunted, bigger than 9-11 attack, is just a spectacular fraud.
[01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:44.832]  And it tells you how crazy the Democrats are that they're betting everything they've got on this.
[01:00:45.292 --> 01:00:47.133]  Ali Alexander, you got the floor.
[01:00:47.173 --> 01:00:52.996]  Please continue on the tie-in into the Whitmer situation and the FBI caught in the false flag.
[01:00:53.036 --> 01:00:53.576]  That's so huge.
[01:00:54.755 --> 01:00:58.676]  Yeah, I apologize for the cruddy Wi-Fi.
[01:00:58.696 --> 01:01:10.479]  But, you know, Alex, what I was saying was, to me, we're looking at the end of the republic, or at least the acknowledgement that we are a fake republic, that this is all an illusion.
[01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:11.939]  And why is that?
[01:01:11.999 --> 01:01:17.000]  Because they can't have America be the superpower if they want a one world government.
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:18.541]  They just cannot have that.
[01:01:18.921 --> 01:01:20.581]  And so what they need is another crisis.
[01:01:20.641 --> 01:01:24.242]  I think that that's why we're watching this internal civil war.
[01:01:24.681 --> 01:01:31.721]   happen within the deep state and within the New World Order, where they are choosing, is it going to be pestilence again?
[01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:34.599]  Is it going to be famine? Or is it going to be war?
[01:01:34.599 --> 01:01:37.721]   Or are they going to give us a trifecta and we're going to get all three?
[01:01:37.721 --> 01:01:41.559]   But what they really, really want to do is that they really, really want to
[01:01:41.559 --> 01:01:44.441]  disassemble the world, recongeal it.
[01:01:44.441 --> 01:01:48.601]   And I think what they need to do is they need to paint the right wing,
[01:01:48.601 --> 01:01:55.161]   the patriots, the believers, as disbelievers, as violent, as haters of their country.
[01:01:55.392 --> 01:01:55.712]  Why?
[01:01:55.992 --> 01:01:57.253]  Because they need to invert it.
[01:01:57.353 --> 01:01:58.454]  These people are alchemists.
[01:01:58.474 --> 01:02:05.100]  You know, they're obsessed with this kind of like chemical formula of, you know, manipulating the masses.
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:10.745]  And so what we're looking at the when we're looking at the Michigan, you know, fake kidnapping.
[01:02:10.945 --> 01:02:11.866]  I don't even know what to call it.
[01:02:11.886 --> 01:02:13.487]  The FBI kidnapping plot.
[01:02:13.968 --> 01:02:18.632]  What you see is, again, they're trying to invert good Michiganders, some of them autists.
[01:02:19.298 --> 01:02:29.507]  And say that, well, they were, they are super sleuths, that they're super brains that were plotting to take out this governor who, by the way, the deep state wants to make a national figure.
[01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:33.430]  They know Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can't be elected.
[01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:35.172]  So they're priming Whitmore.
[01:02:35.432 --> 01:02:36.753]  They're priming Newsom.
[01:02:36.973 --> 01:02:43.159]  They're priming all these other figures to run in their stead because Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to be given to the mob.
[01:02:43.686 --> 01:02:45.107]  You know, this is part of their plan.
[01:02:45.148 --> 01:02:46.169]  They do this all the time.
[01:02:46.189 --> 01:02:50.012]  And so I just, you know, I really fear for our country.
[01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:53.035]  And my only hope is literally in a miracle.
[01:02:53.676 --> 01:02:55.198]  My only hope is in a miracle.
[01:02:55.578 --> 01:03:10.899]   My hope is that people tune out Twitter, that they tune out the New York Times, that they tune out Press releases by the DOJ saying this person admitted this or this person's cooperating because it's all BS.
[01:03:11.139 --> 01:03:14.921]  What they want is that they want our military servicemen to hate the country.
[01:03:15.421 --> 01:03:18.722]  They want believers to give up hope in God.
[01:03:19.182 --> 01:03:21.122]  And that's how they invert the country.
[01:03:21.142 --> 01:03:26.484]  And so what we've got to do is we've just got to, you know, stay primed with true information.
[01:03:27.153 --> 01:03:31.135]  Hunt down the criminal conspiracies, not believe the baseless conspiracies.
[01:03:31.755 --> 01:03:35.357]  And, you know, we've got to be on the lookout for these bots that they want to trap us in.
[01:03:35.937 --> 01:03:38.978]  And, you know, J6 was what they want.
[01:03:39.118 --> 01:03:41.119]  And, you know, I think it's going to get a lot worse.
[01:03:41.519 --> 01:03:53.192]   The Michigan case was a prelude to J6, but I think J6 is a prelude to whatever false flag They're planning to hit Washington, D.C., you know, either around the midterms or shortly thereafter.
[01:03:53.512 --> 01:03:54.353]  I totally agree.
[01:03:54.673 --> 01:03:57.094]  You can see all the pre-programming and the final piece.
[01:03:57.374 --> 01:03:59.075]  It's like when a jigsaw puzzle is already put together.
[01:03:59.095 --> 01:03:59.976]  It's like three pieces left.
[01:04:00.316 --> 01:04:01.137]  You already know what they are.
[01:04:01.557 --> 01:04:07.400]  The next move is false flag, which they believe will trigger a civil war, which is a smoke stream for the Democrat deep state.
[01:04:07.800 --> 01:04:10.102]  And then rhinos they're allied with in the neocons.
[01:04:10.842 --> 01:04:19.485]  To outlaw political dissent, create a one-party state like Venezuela with a ceremonial opposition party, and basically come after their detractors.
[01:04:19.525 --> 01:04:20.685]  I mean, they've lost.
[01:04:20.825 --> 01:04:22.146]  They've already been put down.
[01:04:22.646 --> 01:04:23.846]  America's already woken up.
[01:04:24.506 --> 01:04:25.307]  It's like Terminator.
[01:04:25.327 --> 01:04:28.868]  We've already beaten the machines, so they've got to send a Terminator back in time to defeat us.
[01:04:29.088 --> 01:04:29.688]  We already won.
[01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:34.290]  Yeah, I think that's about right.
[01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:35.290]  So, I don't know.
[01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:36.770]  How do you think that we get at it?
[01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:51.437]   You know, We've seen so many big globalist operations like the poison shots and this Whitmer thing, and there's just countless examples of what they wanted to happen isn't happening in government and corporations.
[01:04:51.457 --> 01:04:58.442]  So I think there's a lot of good people inside the system of every race, color, creed, and sexual preference that just don't like what's happening and get it.
[01:04:58.543 --> 01:05:07.089]  They're not willing to go public, but behind the scenes they're leaking information, they're sabotaging corruption, and I have a lot of faith in humanity right now, Ollie.
[01:05:08.442 --> 01:05:09.463]  Yeah, I think that's right.
[01:05:09.523 --> 01:05:19.028]  I was talking with our friend Pete Santilli one time on his show and he said, and he told me in a private call, he said, what you're going to need are whistleblowers.
[01:05:19.668 --> 01:05:21.850]  We will never beat them without whistleblowers.
[01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:36.458]  And by the grace of God, you know, there's been a trickle, you know, let's not forget that in this, this J6 case where someone was totally acquitted, it took a government witness saying, yeah, the cops did wave them in.
[01:05:36.906 --> 01:05:39.327]  You know, why has it taken this many cases, right?
[01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:41.287]  And you know what they were doing, right?
[01:05:41.567 --> 01:05:51.670]  They were doing all these plea deals, all these plea deals, so that everyone would feel the pressure to lie, to take on prison sentences that they didn't need.
[01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:56.231]  And this is all, again, to build a conspiracy, a criminal conspiracy case.
[01:05:56.836 --> 01:06:02.160]  I totally agree.
[01:06:02.481 --> 01:06:05.503]  Let's talk about MTG.
[01:06:06.003 --> 01:06:09.986]  Democrats accuse Republicans of trying to steal elections by challenging them.
[01:06:10.226 --> 01:06:14.650]  They're saying because you challenge an election with your right, you're not allowed to run.
[01:06:15.451 --> 01:06:22.516]  They have Democratic operatives, and I saw the judge said it can go forward in Georgia, to try to not let MTG, who won in a landslide, run again.
[01:06:22.676 --> 01:06:26.139]  That's blocking votes by not letting people have the candidate they want.
[01:06:27.349 --> 01:06:27.769]  Bingo.
[01:06:27.889 --> 01:06:31.492]  So Mark Elias, he's a famous Democrat lawyer.
[01:06:31.772 --> 01:06:37.256]  He tried this against Madison Cawthorn in North Carolina because North Carolina's structure is really crazy.
[01:06:37.296 --> 01:06:41.339]  By the grace of God, a judge said, no, I'm not going to listen to the Board of Elections.
[01:06:41.679 --> 01:06:42.980]  So that shouldn't have happened.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.621]  So we got an easy win there.
[01:06:45.161 --> 01:06:52.226]  In Georgia, they're using the same 14th Amendment claim against Marjorie Taylor Greene, you know, one of the best members of Congress.
[01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:53.920]  And that's unfortunate.
[01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:59.142]  And in Arizona, they have the Biden electors suing under the 14th Amendment.
[01:06:59.402 --> 01:07:05.164]  Paul Gosar, Annie Biggs, and others, and Mark Fincham, saying that they shouldn't be able to stand for office.
[01:07:05.404 --> 01:07:08.486]  You're seeing a prototype happen for 2023.
[01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:15.049]  They're going to use, they just need one victory in one state so that they can do that against Trump.
[01:07:15.469 --> 01:07:18.090]  Because a lot of people don't realize there's no federal ballot.
[01:07:18.570 --> 01:07:22.375]  There are 50 different ballots that Trump has to qualify for.
[01:07:22.776 --> 01:07:27.522]  And all we need is one rogue state where we need its electoral votes.
[01:07:27.982 --> 01:07:30.245]  And then Trump says, well, I can run in 48 states.
[01:07:30.426 --> 01:07:35.212]  And that's why they put Manafort in prison because they were so mad that he qualified Trump last time.
[01:07:36.209 --> 01:07:37.249]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:42.751]  Take out the strategist, take out the organizer, take out the line of communications, and then you can never have an opposition.
[01:07:42.971 --> 01:07:44.011]  But let me end it with this.
[01:07:44.492 --> 01:07:48.133]  You know, they absolutely want to take out Trump by imploding MAGA.
[01:07:48.433 --> 01:07:51.114]  Hold on, if you gotta go, we gotta go.
[01:07:51.154 --> 01:07:52.694]  But do five more minutes on the other side, Ollie.
[01:07:52.974 --> 01:07:55.715]  I want to talk about how they implode MAGA, how we stop that.
[01:07:55.795 --> 01:07:59.276]  Whether you love Trump or hate Trump, folks, we need to keep that organization in place.
[01:07:59.336 --> 01:08:00.256]  It's pure populism.
[01:08:00.737 --> 01:08:02.177]  Ollie Alexander is our guest.
[01:08:02.257 --> 01:08:05.278]  We'll post all this live interview at Band.Video.
[01:08:05.778 --> 01:08:07.780]  As soon as the transmission is over so you can share it.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.781]  Infowars.com.
[01:08:10.541 --> 01:08:14.004]  So I've been critical of Trump and so has Ali Alexander.
[01:08:14.984 --> 01:08:16.445]  But we understand he means well.
[01:08:16.545 --> 01:08:20.088]  He's a major populist leader or the greatest president in US history.
[01:08:20.128 --> 01:08:21.509]  Took on the globalists toe-to-toe.
[01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:22.830]  Rebuilt America overnight.
[01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:24.511]  That's why they're threatened by him.
[01:08:24.531 --> 01:08:29.094]  That's why they attack him because they hate his supporters of every race, color, and creed.
[01:08:30.333 --> 01:08:46.239]  But make no mistake, there is a battle with the Republican Party and there is a battle with the Democrats to destroy Trump and to take Republican congressmen and women off the ballot and senators claiming because they supported challenging an election that they now can't run for election.
[01:08:46.939 --> 01:08:49.360]  But that's in the Constitution you can challenge an election.
[01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.801]  It was constitutional what Ted Cruz and others were doing.
[01:08:52.241 --> 01:08:54.302]  So their idea is to say you're disqualified.
[01:08:54.582 --> 01:08:57.643]  They're becoming in their own action what they claim they are.
[01:08:57.663 --> 01:08:59.204]  Well, they're saying you can't even vote.
[01:08:59.884 --> 01:09:00.824]  For the person.
[01:09:00.884 --> 01:09:02.125]  They can't even be on the ballot.
[01:09:02.165 --> 01:09:04.325]  That's the ultimate form of rigging things.
[01:09:04.365 --> 01:09:09.767]  So, elaborate on that, Ali Alexander, what you're getting at, of how they're trying to destroy, make America great again.
[01:09:10.927 --> 01:09:18.529]  Yeah, so our strength is that we live in a union of states.
[01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:19.890]  Federalism.
[01:09:20.730 --> 01:09:27.612]  And what the Marxists, what the Luciferians, what the New World Order is attempting to do is to make our strength our weakness.
[01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:45.383]  And so instead of having a union of states that sends different vibrant people, you know, wackos to non-wackos to the Capitol to represent the people, what's instead happened is like we have two corporate parties.
[01:09:45.863 --> 01:09:48.005]  You know, they fund wars and they fund corporations.
[01:09:48.465 --> 01:09:48.865]  That's it.
[01:09:48.965 --> 01:09:53.888]  And then we all argue about the social issues, but all of that's on the slippery slope of liberalism.
[01:09:54.525 --> 01:10:08.773]  And, but what's happening is they've decided, Mark Elias has decided, very well-funded Democrat lawyer, has decided that, well, I will take a dozen states and I will find one that works for me.
[01:10:09.453 --> 01:10:14.496]  And the one that works for me will be a swing state, an electoral vote that Trump needs.
[01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:20.780]  And so what a lot of people don't understand, a lot of people ask me, Ali, why couldn't we create a patriot party?
[01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:22.822]   I say, well, Ballot access laws.
[01:10:22.962 --> 01:10:28.466]  It takes about a decade before a party can get on the ballot in all 50 states.
[01:10:28.606 --> 01:10:30.528]  It can't just show up and you can't just write in.
[01:10:31.229 --> 01:10:36.711]  Half the states in our union do not allow for the counting of write-in votes.
[01:10:37.151 --> 01:10:43.252]  So some states, even if somebody won with 99% and they were written in, it wouldn't count.
[01:10:43.512 --> 01:10:52.435]  And so a lot of patriots don't know this because they're familiar with their local laws and their ballots, but they're not familiar with the rest of the country.
[01:10:52.455 --> 01:10:59.837]  And because I've worked all over the country, and other patriot operatives like Roger Stone have too, we realize where that's vulnerable.
[01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:17.821]  So what we may see, and I've never said this publicly, this will be the first time ever, is what I believe the deep state is going to ultimately come to is they will either criminally refer Trump and then choose very publicly to not prosecute him.
[01:11:18.681 --> 01:11:33.947]   And then in some of those states throw him off the ballot under that pretense alone, or worse, they won't criminally refer him, but the DOJ will charge him independently Biden will pardon him and then they will use that to take him off the ballots.
[01:11:34.308 --> 01:11:44.919]  So imagine, and you know, you and I have had interactions with Trump, you know, where Trump is so full of righteousness and pride and says, well, I'm going to be on the ballot in 48 states.
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:46.521]  I'm going to run anyway.
[01:11:46.541 --> 01:11:47.682]  It's the right thing to do.
[01:11:48.543 --> 01:11:52.768]   And we will be naive to The tsunami we're against, well what does that do?
[01:11:53.128 --> 01:11:57.953]  That incentivizes not the Republican Party to implode, but MAGA to implode.
[01:11:58.153 --> 01:12:02.277]  Because then there will be very reasonable people saying, well why not let General Flynn run?
[01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:04.660]  Or why not let Ron DeSantis run?
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:12.027]  And so what the Deep State seeks to do is to not stab us in the back, but to get our best friend to stab us in the back.
[01:12:12.674 --> 01:12:20.419]  I think Trump is the best way to get new black votes, new Hispanic votes, the woman vote, and turn out and max out the white vote.
[01:12:20.699 --> 01:12:20.880]  Okay?
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:23.341]  I think Trump is the only way the Republicans win.
[01:12:23.962 --> 01:12:31.066]  That being said, if they only put him on 48 ballots or something like that, there is going to be a legitimate debate to be had.
[01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:44.794]   And so that's the existential crisis we have is tens of millions of Americans will want to participate in a system and it will be You know, the illusion will be gone, Alex, and I'm terrified that they're staging a false flag.
[01:12:44.814 --> 01:12:54.523]  They're going to divide the Republican Party, but worse, they will invert the MAGA movement, this beautiful movement that is a collection of patriots and believers.
[01:12:55.223 --> 01:13:01.729]  And, you know, I'm watching it in slow motion through the persecution of you and I. Well, that's right.
[01:13:01.749 --> 01:13:02.930]  And in closing, I'll say this.
[01:13:04.807 --> 01:13:12.269]  They put out that report in June of last year saying our main enemy is people that question elections or lockdowns or forced injections.
[01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:26.332]  And then just about a month ago, the FBI Justice Department put out an official plan saying we believe right-wingers are going to blow stuff up and kill people and launch terror attacks over Trump having the election stolen, as if we do that.
[01:13:26.932 --> 01:13:37.855]   So they're framing everyone to have another election steal that if we question, we'll be at fault for the school or Government building or university or police station that gets blown up.
[01:13:38.335 --> 01:13:42.216]  Obviously, we have no motive to do that, to demonize ourselves.
[01:13:42.336 --> 01:13:43.997]  Obviously, we had no motive to break in the Capitol.
[01:13:44.657 --> 01:13:47.338]  But we see all the pre-programming and preparation for that.
[01:13:47.378 --> 01:13:49.078]  It's clear that's the next phase.
[01:13:50.659 --> 01:14:02.642]  It's the next phase and our country has now said that civil disobedience, which is the great tradition of this country, it's what gave blacks equal access to water fountains and public institutions.
[01:14:03.154 --> 01:14:06.737]  Public accommodation, I should say, because it also includes private institutions.
[01:14:07.617 --> 01:14:08.978]  They're saying that that's outlawed.
[01:14:09.379 --> 01:14:13.382]  And the left is over there snickering, ha ha ha, it's Alex Jones and it's Ali Alexander.
[01:14:13.722 --> 01:14:14.703]  It's you next!
[01:14:15.343 --> 01:14:16.684]  The precedent has been set.
[01:14:16.925 --> 01:14:22.008]  They didn't prosecute Antifa, but they'll sure as hell prosecute you, okay?
[01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:25.992]  We are going to live in a future where there are no masks, and they're going to get you.
[01:14:26.532 --> 01:14:44.702]   And so, what people of all stripes need to realize Is that if you persecute Alex Jones, who is a media publisher, as if he's some militia leader, then what's to stop the non-corporate lefty press from then being prosecuted?
[01:14:45.062 --> 01:15:10.861]   If you prosecute Ali Alexander, who on his own time and own dime ran activism instead of worked on a campaign, then what's to stop the next civil rights movement on the left starting And you know, accomplishing something greater or something stupid, but you know, or something at all, you know, so it can't be overstated that we live in the most consequential time.
[01:15:11.242 --> 01:15:16.925]  There has never been a committee, not with Joseph McCarthy, not with anybody else like the J6 committee.
[01:15:17.264 --> 01:15:24.707]  That was exclusively appointed by one party that has unlimited subpoena power that can criminally refer anyone.
[01:15:24.947 --> 01:15:29.769]  When they don't like what Merrick Garland's doing, they just call over to Joe Biden and say, put pressure on him.
[01:15:30.009 --> 01:15:37.653]  And they've threatened, I've heard from my sources, they've threatened multiple times Merrick Garland sign his paper or resign.
[01:15:38.493 --> 01:15:42.014]  And the guys are signing it, you know, because he's a moderate lunatic.
[01:15:42.374 --> 01:15:45.180]   And so, you know, What we need is prayer.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:46.861]  What we need is diligence.
[01:15:46.941 --> 01:15:53.747]  What we need is discernment above all else, because we can't fall for these info traps, these PsyOps to divide us.
[01:15:54.127 --> 01:15:55.548]  And we've just got to be aware.
[01:15:56.068 --> 01:15:57.470]  And we've got to act as a family.
[01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:58.771]  We've got to act as a unit.
[01:15:58.811 --> 01:16:03.014]  But again, like I said, they've cut Trump's strategists.
[01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:05.837]  They've cut the organizers of the movement like you and me.
[01:16:06.057 --> 01:16:07.960]  They've cut our lines of communications.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.163]  This is what you do in war.
[01:16:10.764 --> 01:16:12.947]  And they are treating us like we are at war.
[01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:16.132]  And so we are in a soft civil war.
[01:16:16.533 --> 01:16:19.277]  And it's one where the right hasn't even punched back, frankly.
[01:16:19.892 --> 01:16:24.234]  You're right, because the right wing and the conservatives and Christians just act like we're still in America.
[01:16:24.274 --> 01:16:24.654]  We're not.
[01:16:25.035 --> 01:16:27.956]  We're in the middle of a globalist takeover at every level.
[01:16:27.996 --> 01:16:29.337]  They're silencing their opposition.
[01:16:29.357 --> 01:16:29.897]  They're suing.
[01:16:29.917 --> 01:16:30.577]  They're attacking.
[01:16:31.077 --> 01:16:32.058]  They are demonizing.
[01:16:32.118 --> 01:16:33.619]  And it's a very, very sad thing to see.
[01:16:33.659 --> 01:16:35.220]  But thank God we're on air exposing it.
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:41.343]  And they still couldn't convict these poor folks that the FBI set up and was ordering to kidnap.
[01:16:41.423 --> 01:16:42.983]  I don't want to kidnap the governor.
[01:16:43.323 --> 01:16:45.825]  And then they indict the young guy that said he didn't want to do it.
[01:16:46.545 --> 01:16:48.546]  Well, the FBI agent's more guilty than him.
[01:16:48.566 --> 01:16:49.466]  He's like, I don't want to do it.
[01:16:49.546 --> 01:16:50.286]  You better do it.
[01:16:50.866 --> 01:16:54.328]  Come out with us and, and, and, and LARP around like you're going to kidnap the governor.
[01:16:54.628 --> 01:16:55.468]  That is so wrong.
[01:16:55.588 --> 01:16:57.128]  Ali Alexander, thank you so much for the time.
[01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.909]  Hey, thanks Alex.
[01:16:59.689 --> 01:17:00.009]  Thank you.
[01:17:00.029 --> 01:17:02.170]  I always liked Ali, but he's, he's really had a lot of courage.
[01:17:02.570 --> 01:17:06.852]  And notice they spin his courage into Ali Alexander's cooperating.
[01:17:07.372 --> 01:17:09.552]  He will soon put Trump in jail.
[01:17:09.572 --> 01:17:13.954]  You get one of these, uh, Justice Department subpoenas.
[01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:18.472]  From a grand jury, if you don't comply, you're gonna go to prison.
[01:17:20.754 --> 01:17:22.115]  And that's just where we are in this country.
[01:17:22.135 --> 01:17:34.165]  And it's not like you're hiding anything, but they just make you come, make you testify for days or weeks, with all these prosecutors trying to twist what you're actually thinking, so they can do it.
[01:17:34.225 --> 01:17:34.886]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:17:34.906 --> 01:17:41.372]  They have all the footage, know what we did, but it's not about Ali Alexander and myself, it's about preparing the false flag to demonize America.
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:43.921]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:44.321 --> 01:17:47.022]  Monday, April 11th, 2022.
[01:17:47.182 --> 01:17:48.522]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[01:17:49.663 --> 01:17:50.683]  Look at these headlines.
[01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:58.226]  Ron Paul, article we've got on Infowars.com, CIA admits feeding Americans false info about Ukraine.
[01:17:59.327 --> 01:18:02.368]  Last Friday, NBC News said, yeah, we lied to you for your own good.
[01:18:02.708 --> 01:18:05.769]  That's the last level of deception when, OK, we weren't lying.
[01:18:06.409 --> 01:18:07.230]  No, we're not lying.
[01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:08.570]  Anybody that says we're lying is bad.
[01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:09.711]  OK, we were lying.
[01:18:09.751 --> 01:18:10.431]  It's for your own good.
[01:18:13.584 --> 01:18:16.086]  Americans flock to credit cards as prices surge.
[01:18:16.266 --> 01:18:16.967]  Oh, isn't that nice?
[01:18:16.987 --> 01:18:17.767]  Going more into debt.
[01:18:18.148 --> 01:18:19.128]  Aren't the bankers happy?
[01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:22.651]  What an incredible time.
[01:18:22.691 --> 01:18:29.697]  I've got all these articles about more soccer stars having heart attacks and microcarditis after they take the shots.
[01:18:31.218 --> 01:18:32.999]  Then we've got Elon Musk.
[01:18:33.159 --> 01:18:39.885]  Twitter strategy may be about countering the ESG political movement, infecting corporations, says expert.
[01:18:41.431 --> 01:18:59.806]  And the ESG, that's a very important point by this Red State article, is the whole UN, World Trade Organization, IMF, Davos Group, Klaus Schwab program, where it's a corporate governance on your politics, whether you're able to get loans or do business.
[01:19:00.066 --> 01:19:02.188]  It's not the law, it's corporate governance.
[01:19:03.629 --> 01:19:07.132]  And they're using leftism because they see that as the more successful system.
[01:19:07.152 --> 01:19:09.734]  They could use anyone, but it's really a control panel.
[01:19:10.558 --> 01:19:12.419]  To get control of society.
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:19.264]  Very, very powerful information.
[01:19:19.304 --> 01:19:20.465]  But I just go back to this.
[01:19:23.287 --> 01:19:35.777]  I know America's in deep trouble, but I have gone out on the streets just the last few days into grocery stores and restaurants and auto parts store, you name it.
[01:19:36.617 --> 01:19:38.659]  And I've never been mobbed like I'm being mobbed now.
[01:19:40.017 --> 01:19:42.518]  And so it's not about Alex Jones is getting mobbed, who cares?
[01:19:43.179 --> 01:19:43.999]  I'm a bellwether.
[01:19:44.499 --> 01:19:49.862]  The average person in an auto parts store or in a grocery store or on the street doesn't know the other person.
[01:19:49.882 --> 01:19:57.406]  But when they see a person they know, their response is key and it's almost completely overwhelming.
[01:19:59.607 --> 01:20:02.208]  I've been the last month in restaurants four times.
[01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:05.009]  Never happened in my life.
[01:20:06.010 --> 01:20:07.831]  I was in one yesterday morning having brunch.
[01:20:09.721 --> 01:20:11.882]  Where I got standing ovations.
[01:20:13.022 --> 01:20:25.186]  In one case, huge restaurant, and I'm getting, everybody starts chanting my name when I first got there, and by the time I left an hour later, standing ovation almost every table up, giving me a standing ovation.
[01:20:25.226 --> 01:20:26.206]  I mean, what is that?
[01:20:26.806 --> 01:20:30.027]  I mean, that was like, unbelievable.
[01:20:31.808 --> 01:20:37.650]  And it happened a couple times before that, three times before that, in the last month.
[01:20:38.973 --> 01:20:41.374]  People get I'm under attack by the corrupt system.
[01:20:41.734 --> 01:20:43.354]  They know we're embattled.
[01:20:43.654 --> 01:20:44.775]  They know we're in trouble.
[01:20:44.795 --> 01:20:45.475]  They can see it.
[01:20:46.115 --> 01:20:47.375]  But they know we're doing it for them.
[01:20:48.796 --> 01:20:58.958]  And there's nothing like seeing that soldier, that champion out there in that fight for you, bloody in at war and stabbed and hurt, getting up off their knees to hack at the enemy again.
[01:20:59.338 --> 01:21:01.099]  People metaphysically recognize it.
[01:21:01.499 --> 01:21:11.172]   And despite all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil, I don't get, oh, give me your autograph, take a picture with you like I'm some TV host or movie star.
[01:21:11.612 --> 01:21:15.417]  I get, Alex Jones is a legend.
[01:21:16.178 --> 01:21:17.319]  Alex Jones is a legend.
[01:21:17.339 --> 01:21:22.746]  I didn't even get my camera out, my phone out, and tell them it was just so embarrassing that I was in this restaurant for brunch.
[01:21:23.823 --> 01:21:26.145]  I was in Traverna yesterday, downtown.
[01:21:26.205 --> 01:21:26.825]  It was great food.
[01:21:27.346 --> 01:21:31.909]  And I get the standing ovation and people clapping and saying my name and Alex Jones is a legend.
[01:21:32.249 --> 01:21:35.131]  And then all the place was jam-packed full of people and it wouldn't stop.
[01:21:35.512 --> 01:21:38.294]  It was just yelling and screaming and it was going on and on.
[01:21:38.354 --> 01:21:41.676]  And then it was white people, black people, Hispanics, women, men, everything.
[01:21:42.137 --> 01:21:45.119]  And I'm sitting there and they're just like, Alex Jones is a legend!
[01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:47.281]  Alex Jones is a legend!
[01:21:48.121 --> 01:21:51.742]  Alex Jones is a legend because they're what they're not talking about Alex Jones.
[01:21:52.022 --> 01:21:56.203]  They're saying screw the system like Let's go Brandon.
[01:21:56.724 --> 01:21:58.544]  We don't buy your bull.
[01:21:58.884 --> 01:22:02.565]  We don't submit anymore We know you're a liar.
[01:22:02.965 --> 01:22:04.266]  We aren't bowing down.
[01:22:04.346 --> 01:22:10.928]  We've broken the spell We're out of the coma And I was sitting there with some family.
[01:22:10.968 --> 01:22:20.076]   I took down there was like what the hell's going on in here It's a regular Italian food restaurant And it was roaring and screaming.
[01:22:22.576 --> 01:22:23.777]  And one woman stood up.
[01:22:24.617 --> 01:22:28.498]  Well, there was just like screaming Alex Jones in there for like two minutes straight.
[01:22:29.818 --> 01:22:31.059]  And I'm sitting there dumbfounded.
[01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:34.640]  And this one lady stands up, young black lady.
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:38.941]  And she's like, Alex Jones, she's kind of goes, ah, whatever.
[01:22:39.301 --> 01:22:40.741]  I was just I wasn't even opposition.
[01:22:42.562 --> 01:22:43.422]  But that's what happened.
[01:22:44.162 --> 01:22:45.002]  And that's real folks.
[01:22:45.042 --> 01:22:45.603]  That's magic.
[01:22:45.623 --> 01:22:46.363]  That's God's power.
[01:22:47.165 --> 01:22:48.306]  That's the will of God right there.
[01:22:48.326 --> 01:22:50.347]  That's how that really works, and I've experienced it every day.
[01:22:50.728 --> 01:23:15.995]   They may have the controlled media, and they may have the big banks, they may have the universities, they may have most of the police departments, but they don't have our hearts and souls, and they don't have control of the people, and the people know that the persecution of this broadcast, and the demonization of this broadcast, and the attacks of these shows, and the media, and what we do, Is a testament to liberty.
[01:23:16.716 --> 01:23:24.138]  And they're smart enough to know if the system that lies to me hates this man, he must really be good.
[01:23:24.938 --> 01:23:25.598]  And I am good.
[01:23:26.298 --> 01:23:27.118]  I am a good person.
[01:23:27.559 --> 01:23:28.239]  I love God.
[01:23:28.539 --> 01:23:29.359]  I've got my sins.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:33.260]  I really like women and stuff like that.
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.781]  But at the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, I love God.
[01:23:37.321 --> 01:23:39.142]  And I am a good person.
[01:23:40.029 --> 01:23:46.332]  That's what I try to find out of billions of things we've covered with all the guests and all the hosts, millions and millions, billions of exaggeration.
[01:23:47.353 --> 01:23:51.115]  They find a few times we're wrong, and a few times we weren't perfect, and a few times we were tired.
[01:23:51.135 --> 01:23:52.756]  They go, look at this, he's wrong!
[01:23:53.116 --> 01:23:53.496]  You know what?
[01:23:53.516 --> 01:23:56.838]  We are wrong sometimes, but not on purpose like you.
[01:23:59.379 --> 01:24:03.642]  We fight with everything we've got, to be accurate.
[01:24:04.122 --> 01:24:07.464]  We fight with our heart and soul for humanity.
[01:24:08.550 --> 01:24:16.296]  And these sociopaths and these Satanists, they look at those of us that fight for liberty and freedom because we have empathy and we love humanity, and they think we're weak.
[01:24:16.316 --> 01:24:17.677]  They're like, what's wrong with you, kid?
[01:24:17.997 --> 01:24:19.038]  You could be in charge!
[01:24:19.078 --> 01:24:20.479]  You just started feeding on people!
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.300]  I'm not going to be part of that.
[01:24:23.201 --> 01:24:24.442]  Because my soul ain't for sale.
[01:24:26.003 --> 01:24:28.985]  But I'll tell you this, what is for sale is you keeping us on the air.
[01:24:29.566 --> 01:24:35.570]  You won't control what we say or do supporting us, but you'll keep this hardcore information on air at a critical time.
[01:24:35.610 --> 01:24:36.651]  And I tell you, we need your help.
[01:24:38.038 --> 01:24:39.639]  I don't want to have to declare bankruptcy.
[01:24:41.119 --> 01:24:42.280]  If we have to, we have to.
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:44.041]  But I'm telling you, we're on empty.
[01:24:44.401 --> 01:24:45.201]  The fumes are there.

[01:25:53.326 --> 01:25:56.468]  Listen, I'm fighting the new world order at Point Blank Range.
[01:25:57.049 --> 01:25:59.050]  We've had devastating victories in my life.

[01:26:03.412 --> 01:26:05.313]  In fact, more than one dent.

[01:26:12.017 --> 01:26:14.779]  And they want to destroy me because of it, because they're scared of us, and they should be.
[01:26:15.745 --> 01:26:17.568]  I'll tell you, I'll go into the end no matter what happens.
[01:26:17.588 --> 01:26:19.471]  Whether we win, lose, I collapse.
[01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:22.355]  I'm just telling you, I've got more victory left in me.
[01:26:23.337 --> 01:26:24.759]  I'm long in the tooth now, folks.
[01:26:24.579 --> 01:26:28.739]  folks, 48 in a 28 year war is like I'm 100, okay?
[01:26:28.739 --> 01:26:31.679]  (laughs)
[01:26:31.679 --> 01:26:34.178]  The enemy looks and goes, he looks tired.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:34.940]  He looks hurt.
[01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:36.261]  Yeah, I look hurt.
[01:26:36.501 --> 01:26:38.923]  I've been stabbing your ass hard.
[01:26:39.623 --> 01:26:40.443]  I've been biting you.
[01:26:40.524 --> 01:26:41.724]  I've been, yeah.
[01:26:42.205 --> 01:26:43.285]  You bet I look bad.
[01:26:43.305 --> 01:26:47.888]  Because I've been putting my will against you for a long time.
[01:26:47.908 --> 01:26:50.550]  I have set the fires.
[01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:53.151]  We have prepared the resistance.
[01:26:54.492 --> 01:26:55.753]  We have laid the way.
[01:26:55.773 --> 01:26:58.875]  You bet I'm hurt.
[01:27:00.319 --> 01:27:01.561]  You bet I'm screwed up now!
[01:27:01.581 --> 01:27:03.785]  Ain't no going back now!
[01:27:03.805 --> 01:27:05.528]  And I know!
[01:27:07.284 --> 01:27:18.230]  My best days are still here to come, but I can't fight these people in the ring for you if you don't pray for me, and if you don't spread the word, and if you don't buy our products.
[01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:25.313]  And I'm telling you, I'm telling you, as sure as the sun came up this morning, if you don't support us financially, we're going to implode very, very soon.
[01:27:25.854 --> 01:27:29.736]  And the globalists will celebrate like chickens with their heads cut off, but that's okay.
[01:27:30.056 --> 01:27:30.636]  That's what they do.
[01:27:31.436 --> 01:27:33.436]  Alright ladies and gentlemen!
[01:27:33.936 --> 01:27:49.936]  (Screaming)
[01:27:49.936 --> 01:27:55.936]  (Explosion)
[01:27:55.936 --> 01:27:58.275]  (whistling)
[01:27:40.759 --> 01:27:56.078]   *Screaming* *Intro*
[01:27:56.078 --> 01:28:34.399]   *Music* *Outro*
[01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:35.350]  It's all come out.
[01:28:35.971 --> 01:28:42.413]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made in the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[01:28:42.733 --> 01:28:45.214]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[01:28:45.955 --> 01:28:51.737]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with, but boy, is it true.
[01:28:53.633 --> 01:28:58.896]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[01:28:59.437 --> 01:29:11.685]  They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they know we are strong and they know in the end they signed on the god of this world who is a loser.
[01:29:11.705 --> 01:29:15.647]  And that's why it's so important that everybody keep InfoWars on the air now more than ever.
[01:29:16.128 --> 01:29:20.911]  Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting and setting up is satanic.
[01:29:25.111 --> 01:29:29.788]  It's just the beginning of what they have planned for our little ones.
[01:29:30.743 --> 01:29:35.526]  I wish to raise a matter this afternoon for the attention of the Minister for Education.
[01:29:35.566 --> 01:29:39.388]  And I have to say, it is not often in this job I am absolutely shocked.
[01:29:39.408 --> 01:29:40.789]  I thought I'd seen everything.
[01:29:41.589 --> 01:29:45.851]  But this one is just beyond words.
[01:29:47.192 --> 01:29:54.216]  It is a note from a constituent who says, Hi Bernie, this is a worksheet that my 10-year-old daughter brought home from school.
[01:29:54.276 --> 01:29:55.837]  And it includes a photo of the worksheet.
[01:29:56.597 --> 01:30:03.726]   Part of her homework was to discuss with her father His erections and ejaculation.
[01:30:05.226 --> 01:30:09.108]  I find this very disturbing and sickening, as indeed do I, I have to say.
[01:30:10.369 --> 01:30:19.413]  What the hell is going on in this state when ten-year-old girls are told to go home and talk to your father about his erections and about his ejaculations?
[01:30:19.773 --> 01:30:21.314]  What the hell is going on here?
[01:30:21.714 --> 01:30:24.495]  We're delighted that the Family Sex Show will be on in May.
[01:30:24.555 --> 01:30:28.317]  I'm going to hand over to Josie, the Artistic Director of this egg, to say a little more.
[01:30:28.837 --> 01:30:35.142]  I run this egg and I have been making and producing the Family Sex Show along with lots of other people over the last few years.
[01:30:35.162 --> 01:30:40.545]  Family Sex Show is a fun and playful show for adults and children aged 5 and up.
[01:30:40.866 --> 01:30:48.791]  It offers an honest human sex education that is feminist, queer, non-binary, inclusive and sex positive.
[01:30:48.991 --> 01:30:58.198]  This show can allow audiences of all ages to feel confident about their bodies, their boundaries and their sexual health and we really hope to see you here.
[01:30:58.878 --> 01:31:01.459]  So those of us that stand up for the little ones are going to be attacked.
[01:31:01.479 --> 01:31:02.460]  We're going to be demonized.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:03.000]  We're going to be shot.
[01:31:03.821 --> 01:31:05.001]  We're going to be killed.
[01:31:05.021 --> 01:31:05.862]  We're going to be imprisoned.
[01:31:05.882 --> 01:31:06.962]  We're going to be tortured.
[01:31:07.002 --> 01:31:09.243]  We're going to be... A lot of things are going to happen to a lot of us.
[01:31:09.764 --> 01:31:14.886]  But at the end of the day, ladies and gentlemen, God is watching and God is in control.
[01:31:14.906 --> 01:31:19.689]  And those evildoers carrying these wicked deeds out will pay.
[01:31:20.649 --> 01:31:28.155]  Ecclesiastes 1.18 is, For in much wisdom is much grief, and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow.
[01:31:28.695 --> 01:31:29.736]  I have much knowledge.
[01:31:29.756 --> 01:31:32.218]  And I have much sorrow.
[01:31:32.678 --> 01:31:33.679]  Much sorrow for thee.
[01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:37.831]  Hundreds of millions of innocent people starving to death right now.
[01:31:38.352 --> 01:31:40.573]  We're looking at 260 million people.
[01:31:41.173 --> 01:31:42.394]  And I'm not talking about hungry.
[01:31:42.774 --> 01:31:46.036]  I'm talking about marching towards starvation.
[01:31:46.376 --> 01:31:49.157]  And that is a catastrophe in itself.
[01:31:49.557 --> 01:31:56.401]  Lockdowns around the world have led to labor shortages, supply chain disruption, and a reduction in international trade.
[01:31:57.722 --> 01:31:58.202]  The result?
[01:31:58.622 --> 01:31:59.703]  Less available food.
[01:32:01.583 --> 01:32:03.024]  And less money to pay for it.
[01:32:05.486 --> 01:32:10.910]  It's a deadly combination and we've got to act now and we've got to be smart and we've got to thread the needle.
[01:32:10.950 --> 01:32:14.753]  You can't just deal with COVID by itself or hunger by itself.
[01:32:14.813 --> 01:32:17.375]  They must be dealt with together.
[01:32:17.736 --> 01:32:19.277]  If we do it right, we can save lives.
[01:32:19.317 --> 01:32:21.199]  If we don't do it right, people will die.
[01:32:24.481 --> 01:32:42.195]  Sitcoms, and then people that are living in pockets still of Western freedom, Western wealth, just go about their business, playing golf and tennis and having fun and going to movies, and as the water rises, where those final islands of safety and security will finally be engulfed.
[01:32:42.796 --> 01:32:44.177]  But ignorance is bliss, right?
[01:32:44.717 --> 01:32:52.964]  But we are about to see the world we've known destroyed, and on its ashes built a system designed to destroy the human that's made in the image of God.
[01:32:53.899 --> 01:33:04.185]  It's a very painful thing to see the spirit of evil spreading its black wings over the earth and sinking its long stinking fangs into our children's very souls.
[01:33:04.826 --> 01:33:06.947]  But that is the price of consciousness and free will.
[01:33:07.147 --> 01:33:09.009]  For good is not the only thing in the universe.
[01:33:09.269 --> 01:33:10.690]  Evil dwells there as well.
[01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:17.034]  And it is when those good spirits do not stand up and fight for innocence that innocence is destroyed.
[01:33:17.753 --> 01:33:31.833]  And then the blood of the children is on our hands.
[01:33:31.849 --> 01:33:32.210]  He did it.
[01:33:33.393 --> 01:33:40.076]  Because I want to bring things to listeners that help our broadcast stay on the air and fight the globalists and that help you and that help the folks that are helping you.
[01:33:40.457 --> 01:33:42.338]  A 360 win, a non-zero-sum game.
[01:33:43.218 --> 01:33:59.952]   And I've gotten so much great feedback in the last few months as we've been promoting Tyler Bennett and American Tax Solutions and the site that's connected to it so we get the sponsorship support, jonestaxrelief.com, that I wanted to just have him back on because, listen, Here's the thing.
[01:34:00.754 --> 01:34:04.881]  The New World Order takes over by you being in the dark and you not knowing how things work.
[01:34:05.282 --> 01:34:07.546]  As Christ said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[01:34:08.994 --> 01:34:12.055]  And it's like trying to drive a car without gasoline.
[01:34:12.696 --> 01:34:16.637]  Or it's like trying to go out in a snowstorm without a jacket or your pants on or your boots on.
[01:34:17.418 --> 01:34:19.359]  To not know the tax code in the U.S.
[01:34:19.379 --> 01:34:25.041]  was written so rich people don't pay it and middle class and poor people do.
[01:34:25.642 --> 01:34:27.702]  And there's so many functions and so many facets.
[01:34:28.023 --> 01:34:30.704]  We couldn't run our business without tax lawyers.
[01:34:30.744 --> 01:34:36.266]  This guy's one of the best with fast acting help that's inexpensive and amazing.
[01:34:36.346 --> 01:34:40.018]   So we're talking about 90% savings?
[01:34:41.158 --> 01:34:42.519]  For almost nothing?
[01:34:42.619 --> 01:34:46.661]  I mean, again, I want you to know the tactics the establishment's using.
[01:34:47.181 --> 01:34:50.303]  This is just like a car needs wheels, it needs tires, it needs an engine.
[01:34:51.063 --> 01:34:58.267]  You need to know about this and not just accept the system that your employer says, or accept the system that you're being told by your CPA.
[01:34:58.747 --> 01:35:03.470]  So Tyler Bennett is a tax professional, lawyer, the owner-operator of Tax Reform American Tax Solutions.
[01:35:03.870 --> 01:35:05.171]  I've used them, had family use them.
[01:35:05.451 --> 01:35:08.713]  JonesTaxRelief.com takes you right to the sub-page.
[01:35:09.153 --> 01:35:11.655]  Where we get sponsor support when you work with them.
[01:35:11.935 --> 01:35:14.077]  They've got so many great services.
[01:35:14.137 --> 01:35:18.080]  So, Tyler Bennett, great to have you back with us today on this Monday edition.
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:25.266]  Tell us about some of the services and some of the stories and what's unfolding and what's happening because listeners really need to know.
[01:35:25.286 --> 01:35:34.453]  This is one of the few areas in our lives with these plunging economies and dollars being devalued and currencies being devalued where we can really get a leg up.
[01:35:35.199 --> 01:35:37.541]  That's right, Alex, and it's great to be back on the show.
[01:35:38.041 --> 01:35:40.102]  And here's the thing that I want to tell everybody.
[01:35:40.162 --> 01:35:45.746]  First and foremost, as you are probably aware, April 18th is the filing deadline, right?
[01:35:46.067 --> 01:35:50.350]  So if you haven't thought about it yet, we definitely need to make sure that you're headed the right path.
[01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:53.012]  So you're not because if you file late, you pay late.
[01:35:53.092 --> 01:35:53.512]  Guess what?
[01:35:53.752 --> 01:36:02.918]  You're getting stuck with penalties and interest, and that's money that's going to support people that do not like you, that are against you, as Alex was just saying, right?
[01:36:03.198 --> 01:36:16.227]  So you want your money to go for the globalists as least as possible, to stay in your pocket, and so you can support the things that you want to, your church, your small business, and not the globalist agenda.
[01:36:17.028 --> 01:36:17.929]  And that's what's crazy.
[01:36:18.010 --> 01:36:19.532]  I only promote things that work really well.
[01:36:19.552 --> 01:36:20.654]  Like, hey, take D3.
[01:36:20.674 --> 01:36:21.896]  You won't get all these viruses.
[01:36:22.017 --> 01:36:23.659]  Or, hey, brush your teeth is good.
[01:36:23.699 --> 01:36:24.621]  Or, hey, drink filtered water.
[01:36:24.982 --> 01:36:27.286]  Like, they've written the tax code here in the U.S.
[01:36:27.306 --> 01:36:28.768]  Do we have the most corrupt tax code?
[01:36:29.514 --> 01:36:31.155]  I would say absolutely, Alex.
[01:36:31.695 --> 01:36:37.979]  Explain the tax code first to them, because again, it's written for the establishment by lawyers, so they're exempt, but we're not.
[01:36:38.459 --> 01:36:38.900]  Absolutely.
[01:36:39.160 --> 01:36:45.304]  So if we look historically here, the tax code was put in the law of the 16th Amendment in 1913.
[01:36:45.664 --> 01:37:04.237]   And since that day forward, The globalist lobbyist parties have been able to put in extremely hard to understand for the layperson deductions and credits and loopholes that they already know about because they lobbied to put it in the tax code in the first place.
[01:37:04.497 --> 01:37:22.770]   And so what we aim to do and are successful at doing it is providing those exact same deductions and loopholes to the small business owner, to the average American, Who the globalists would love for you to support their entire regime while they skate by paying nothing so they can have another yacht.
[01:37:24.231 --> 01:37:25.492]  So let's talk about the services.
[01:37:25.512 --> 01:37:29.355]  Let's talk about some of the ideas because this is a win-win and it's a news item as well.
[01:37:30.808 --> 01:37:31.429]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:37:31.789 --> 01:37:38.155]  So, first and foremost, okay, there is the standard deduction and itemized deductions, right?
[01:37:38.396 --> 01:37:52.989]   The reason the standard deduction was created is because the globalists don't want more people writing off as much as they can in taxes, so they say unless you can surmount the standard deduction, which is $12,400, Then you can't take any itemized deductions.
[01:37:53.349 --> 01:37:57.851]  Now, interestingly enough, Alex, this is one of the things that Hunter Biden is going to get in trouble for.
[01:37:58.231 --> 01:37:59.271]  But I digress.
[01:37:59.611 --> 01:38:08.254]  The thing is, is if you go to one of these big box tax stores, they're not going to necessarily give you all the deductions that you are entitled to.
[01:38:08.294 --> 01:38:09.134]  And the reason is this.
[01:38:09.515 --> 01:38:13.736]  When you go to a big box store, you're treated like everyone is the exact same.
[01:38:14.056 --> 01:38:16.717]  But everyone's tax situation is completely unique.
[01:38:16.997 --> 01:38:18.938]  There are no two taxpayers that are the same.
[01:38:19.238 --> 01:38:28.144]  And so it needs to be treated with a bestoke level of care so that you get and pay the least amount of tax as possible.
[01:38:28.204 --> 01:38:34.569]  Break down just some of the facts, some of the known historic points that big corporations use, that little people use as well, that are completely legal.
[01:38:35.504 --> 01:38:36.045]  Absolutely.
[01:38:36.285 --> 01:38:50.015]  So one that is so big that everyone needs to know is if you're planning on starting a business, there's up to $5,000 in deductible expenses before you even start your business.
[01:38:50.355 --> 01:38:56.960]  So if you know that, that means you might be more likely to go out there and actually start that business instead of staying where you're at.
[01:38:57.401 --> 01:39:02.185]   Another one is You have to know everything that's deductible versus what's income.
[01:39:02.305 --> 01:39:13.056]  A big example and what corporations do to their shareholders is, let's say I'm the shareholder of a corporation, I can receive a loan from my own company tax-free as long as I'm paying interest on it.
[01:39:13.356 --> 01:39:16.639]  These are the kind of things that the globalists do to not pay taxes.
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:22.963]   And this is the kind of thing that if you're also in the correct entity setup, you can take advantage of as well.
[01:39:22.963 --> 01:39:26.222]   Another thing is research and development costs, marketing costs.
[01:39:26.222 --> 01:39:30.703]   Once you're involved in a business, almost everything is deductible.
[01:39:30.703 --> 01:39:36.903]   And that's the thing that you're not gonna get from Joe Schmoe's accounting firm down at the corner
[01:39:36.903 --> 01:39:40.043]   because they're not advocates, and we are, and what we're gonna do is make sure
[01:39:40.043 --> 01:39:42.943]  you're paying the least amount as possible every year.
[01:39:42.943 --> 01:39:48.283]   Why do the other big law firms and some of the CPAs not give you real service?
[01:39:48.316 --> 01:39:57.808]  It's documented, I think even like Money Magazine 30 years ago said, we did 50 different tax returns with 50 CPAs that were all different.
[01:39:58.689 --> 01:40:01.273]  Why don't they give the public what the elite get?
[01:40:02.150 --> 01:40:04.510]  Well, so Alex, it's a two-fold reason, right?
[01:40:04.810 --> 01:40:13.852]  So first of all, and the honest truth is a lot of these CPAs, a lot of these firms are not currently up to date on the ever-changing tax code, which changes every year.
[01:40:13.872 --> 01:40:14.452]  So they're lazy?
[01:40:15.132 --> 01:40:18.213]  They're lazy, and it's just they're not up to date, right?
[01:40:18.453 --> 01:40:25.334]  Because the tax code changes whenever the lobbies decide to change the tax code, and that's what makes it so confounding to the layperson.
[01:40:25.374 --> 01:40:30.715]  That's what makes it so hard for you just to go out there and file a tax return on your own and not get screwed over.
[01:40:31.075 --> 01:40:39.357]  Because it changes so often to fit both their needs and also to keep you in the dark on purpose.
[01:40:39.797 --> 01:41:05.765]   And then the other reason is, Alex, these major law firms, the big four accounting firms, the big five law firms, they have a vested interest in keeping their blue chip clients happy and that's really all they want is to accept millions of dollars from these globalists to perform the services Which are available to many more people than that, but they want to keep the doors shut because they don't want to let you part of their club.
[01:41:06.065 --> 01:41:08.046]  Why say, you're invited to my club, come on in?
[01:41:09.106 --> 01:41:09.547]  Well, that's it.
[01:41:09.567 --> 01:41:10.747]  You're letting them know the tricks.
[01:41:11.227 --> 01:41:11.508]  That's right.
[01:41:11.528 --> 01:41:14.289]  And people can find it all at jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:41:14.309 --> 01:41:16.410]  It's a subpage of all the same services.
[01:41:16.430 --> 01:41:21.392]  We just get credit and sponsorship support at the great American Tax Solutions Company with Tyler Bennett.
[01:41:21.952 --> 01:41:27.335]  And again, it's very frustrating that people keep this Promethean fire from the public.
[01:41:28.317 --> 01:41:28.877]  Absolutely.
[01:41:29.217 --> 01:41:44.223]  And I want to add, if you have crypto assets, whether you've bought, sold, or just holding, the IRS is, right after you see this article I have, the IRS right now is trying to seize more money this year in crypto assets than they did last year.
[01:41:44.564 --> 01:41:47.525]  They seized $3.5 billion last year.
[01:41:47.945 --> 01:41:57.370]   So that's a lot of money, they're coming after the middle class, per usual, and so what you need to do is make sure that when you file, You're filing in the correct way.
[01:41:57.450 --> 01:42:06.661]  Someone who understands crypto taxes is doing it and you need to do it sooner rather than later because the tax deadline is coming up and I can talk about extensions.
[01:42:07.041 --> 01:42:12.067]  So most people are going to file an extension or their accountant is going to tell them.
[01:42:12.307 --> 01:42:12.487]  Right?
[01:42:12.727 --> 01:42:19.110]  What your accountant doesn't tell you is if you file an extension and don't pay, you're still stuck with the penalties for not paying.
[01:42:19.491 --> 01:42:21.692]  There is no extension to pay your taxes.
[01:42:21.772 --> 01:42:22.872]  It's only to file.
[01:42:23.172 --> 01:42:28.775]  Now you must file your taxes, otherwise it's against the law and you don't want to break the law because then they'll come after you extra hard.
[01:42:30.490 --> 01:42:42.153]  If, you know, Joe Blow, accountant, is filing extension for you, you're filing extension on yourself, it's more likely than not you're doing it incorrectly and you're going to pay the government more than you actually owe in terms of penalties and interest.
[01:42:42.673 --> 01:42:47.375]  Now, if we do it correctly for you, you'll pay exactly what you owe, if you owe anything at all.
[01:42:47.635 --> 01:42:47.975]  All right.
[01:42:48.635 --> 01:42:51.696]  Tyler Bennett, jonestaxrelief.com is our guest.
[01:42:52.997 --> 01:42:55.619]  This is the real silver lining to all this corruption.
[01:42:56.079 --> 01:42:57.800]  Knowing the tricks the establishment uses.
[01:42:58.401 --> 01:42:59.982]  None of the taxes used to fund the country.
[01:43:00.102 --> 01:43:01.343]  It's all for social control.
[01:43:01.784 --> 01:43:04.206]  You need to learn how to save up to 90% right now.
[01:43:05.106 --> 01:43:07.288]  You know, Tyler Bennett's a great lawyer here with us.
[01:43:07.408 --> 01:43:09.210]  He runs tax professionals.
[01:43:10.199 --> 01:43:15.304]  With the great work he does in American Tax Solutions, that's a subdomain, jonestaxrelief.com, or 833-900-4285.
[01:43:15.324 --> 01:43:19.008]  And it's real simple.
[01:43:19.488 --> 01:43:30.279]  You read about Google paying zero tax, you read about IBM paying zero tax, you read about Microsoft paying 1%, you read about all that, and Elon Musk says, I'm not going to do that, I'll pay 10%.
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:32.321]  He's even pointing that out.
[01:43:32.341 --> 01:43:33.502]  I'm not lionizing him.
[01:43:33.542 --> 01:43:34.662]  It's just he does pay more than they do.
[01:43:35.123 --> 01:43:36.884]  They run all these offshore tax scams.
[01:43:36.924 --> 01:43:38.265]  This is offshore stuff we're talking about.
[01:43:38.545 --> 01:43:39.446]  This is in the U.S.
[01:43:39.506 --> 01:43:45.170]  tax code to cut taxes with one designation in a corporation from 40 to 20.
[01:43:46.010 --> 01:43:47.011]  And you explain all this.
[01:43:47.071 --> 01:43:50.393]  It's so frustrating that I'll, like, tell people.
[01:43:50.413 --> 01:43:55.377]  I'll be sitting in a restaurant and hear people, like, going, man, I got a 40% tax bracket and I'm going bankrupt.
[01:43:55.537 --> 01:43:56.678]  Man, I can't pay for the bills.
[01:43:57.158 --> 01:44:00.200]  I go, hey, you know, you can, like, sign up a special corporation and make it 20% right now.
[01:44:01.221 --> 01:44:02.262]  Yeah, right, buddy.
[01:44:02.762 --> 01:44:05.543]  Everybody would know that if it was true.
[01:44:05.863 --> 01:44:07.124]  They don't know.
[01:44:07.144 --> 01:44:09.705]  They think it's weird that you're warning them.
[01:44:09.745 --> 01:44:10.365]  Explain that to them.
[01:44:10.545 --> 01:44:11.626]  That's absolutely right, Alex.
[01:44:11.806 --> 01:44:21.109]   Since 2017, the TCJA changed the Republican tax overhaul, changed the tax code from The corporate tax rate was 35 percent.
[01:44:21.330 --> 01:44:22.570]  Now it is 21 percent.
[01:44:22.590 --> 01:44:23.330]  It has been since 2017.
[01:44:23.730 --> 01:44:31.852]  And as we were previously saying, a lot of these CPAs and tax preparers aren't up to date on the law, even one that's five years ago.
[01:44:32.472 --> 01:44:36.053]  And so they don't necessarily know that what the best entity to be in.
[01:44:36.113 --> 01:44:39.113]  But the C Corp is the best entity to be in since 2017.
[01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:42.334]  If you are a business, you're making lots of revenue.
[01:44:42.834 --> 01:44:43.615]  Or you're making money.
[01:44:44.135 --> 01:45:12.419]   So the thing is, this is absolutely what the globalists use, because through international taxation, which is a true pay-to-play concept, in that if you have enough money, you are a globalist, you can use the tax treaties between the United States and other NATO countries, Ireland, United Kingdom, to lower, let's say Apple is an example of a company that does this, the effective tax rate between what they pay globally, well that's just
[01:45:12.419 --> 01:45:16.109]   an option that's not available to most middle class business owners.
[01:45:16.109 --> 01:45:17.669]  But that doesn't mean there's nothing we can do.
[01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:22.028]   But let me talk for a second about this attack on the middle class because it doesn't end
[01:45:22.028 --> 01:45:23.028]  there, okay?
[01:45:23.028 --> 01:45:25.508]  Of course we all know we have record inflation.
[01:45:25.508 --> 01:45:31.048]   Of course we all know because of the war in Ukraine and the administration's decisions,
[01:45:31.048 --> 01:45:33.709]  we have higher than ever before gas prices.
[01:45:33.931 --> 01:45:39.779]  But here's one more area where you're getting hit is a hidden tax increase.
[01:45:40.179 --> 01:45:46.586]   And what I mean is every year Taxes go up by a certain index mark of inflation.
[01:45:46.827 --> 01:45:47.187]  It's about 3%.
[01:45:48.108 --> 01:45:49.610]  But this year, inflation is at 8%.
[01:45:50.811 --> 01:45:58.619]  So what that means is you're paying an additional 5% in taxes this year because the tax rates didn't go up to match inflation.
[01:45:58.980 --> 01:46:01.202]  And Biden didn't have to raise taxes to do that.
[01:46:01.503 --> 01:46:02.564]  He just gets it.
[01:46:03.024 --> 01:46:06.565]  So that's what happens, and so that's part of the trifecta.
[01:46:06.605 --> 01:46:07.646]  It's not just at the pump.
[01:46:08.066 --> 01:46:10.767]  It's not just that everything, including a gallon of milk, costs more.
[01:46:11.127 --> 01:46:14.788]  But they're going to get more of your taxes because inflation went up higher than they thought it would.
[01:46:15.168 --> 01:46:16.949]  Because they printed off all the money in the first place.
[01:46:17.689 --> 01:46:18.010]  Wow.
[01:46:18.110 --> 01:46:22.871]  So talk about, again, explain to people the corporation that lowers your tax rate by half.
[01:46:23.311 --> 01:46:23.852]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:46:25.578 --> 01:46:27.239]  There are several different entities out there.
[01:46:27.319 --> 01:46:28.719]  Everyone likes LLCs.
[01:46:28.799 --> 01:46:29.939]  LLC does nothing for you.
[01:46:30.119 --> 01:46:31.340]  There's an S-Corp, right?
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:35.561]  S-Corp is still a flow-through entity, meaning you're going to pay individual tax rates on it.
[01:46:35.821 --> 01:46:40.783]  There is one flat tax in this entire country, and it is the corporate tax rate.
[01:46:40.883 --> 01:46:48.586]  The only entities that pay the corporate tax rate are what's called C-Corporations, the largest section of the Internal Revenue Code.
[01:46:48.606 --> 01:46:49.406]  It's about this thick.
[01:46:50.186 --> 01:46:54.433]  Is in regards to C-corporations in particular and nothing else.
[01:46:54.473 --> 01:47:00.844]  And that's because all the Fortune 500 companies, all the big guys, everyone traded on New York Stock Exchange, etc.
[01:47:01.465 --> 01:47:03.608]  is this type of entity for multiple reasons.
[01:47:04.477 --> 01:47:11.919]  A C-Corp is its own citizen in the United States, meaning that if it messes up and owes a lot of taxes, well guess what?
[01:47:12.179 --> 01:47:13.419]  You can sink it and move on.
[01:47:13.459 --> 01:47:16.740]  And in most of those situations, that's not going to pierce the corporate veil.
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:19.441]  What that means is be imputed on you personally.
[01:47:19.921 --> 01:47:24.342]  However, it absolutely would be if you had an LLC or an S-Corp, and you wouldn't be paying 21%.
[01:47:24.462 --> 01:47:26.682]  And again, these are the tricks the establishment uses.
[01:47:26.722 --> 01:47:27.262]  They don't want to know.
[01:47:27.282 --> 01:47:29.403]  You're like a magician showing people the tricks.
[01:47:30.083 --> 01:47:30.544]  Absolutely.
[01:47:30.584 --> 01:47:35.870]  See, Alex, what people don't know is, at the end of the day, every tax is negotiable.
[01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:39.334]  Especially if you're paying a large enough tax.
[01:47:39.554 --> 01:47:40.255]  It's negotiable.
[01:47:40.295 --> 01:47:41.877]  The IRS is a collection agency.
[01:47:41.917 --> 01:47:42.718]  They want their money.
[01:47:43.179 --> 01:47:43.439]  Okay?
[01:47:43.699 --> 01:47:48.182]   And so our clients never pay one penny more then they absolutely have to.
[01:47:48.182 --> 01:47:54.622]   And here's the other thing, is when you go out there and you see the administration and
[01:47:54.622 --> 01:47:58.282]   you don't agree with what the administration is doing, and you see the large technology
[01:47:58.282 --> 01:48:02.943]   companies and you don't agree with what they're doing, I feel I have to tell you that the
[01:48:02.943 --> 01:48:06.542]  big box tax companies are technology companies.
[01:48:06.542 --> 01:48:11.702]   And so if you don't want to fund their agenda, come over here because we believe in what
[01:48:12.676 --> 01:48:13.336]  You're our friend.
[01:48:13.656 --> 01:48:15.397]  We have the same ideals.
[01:48:15.798 --> 01:48:16.618]  Well, I mean, that's it.
[01:48:16.678 --> 01:48:19.720]  You have basically big tech running the tax preparing system.
[01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:20.280]  Absolutely.
[01:48:20.300 --> 01:48:21.501]  They're screwing people, as usual.
[01:48:21.981 --> 01:48:24.142]  100% because we already know how they feel.
[01:48:24.162 --> 01:48:26.244]  A, about conservative viewpoints.
[01:48:26.644 --> 01:48:33.148]  B, about keeping people down and allowing the government to control everybody.
[01:48:33.568 --> 01:48:34.989]  That's part of their agenda.
[01:48:35.109 --> 01:48:37.350]  So if you don't want to support that, don't give them your money.
[01:48:37.491 --> 01:48:42.233]  It may seem like a simple $500 to H&R Block, but realize what that $500 is going to fund.
[01:48:44.423 --> 01:48:48.244]  Continuing, because it's not just getting people that have a big tax bill, cutting it down 90%.
[01:48:48.744 --> 01:48:50.724]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:48:50.785 --> 01:48:53.345]  It's not just, you guys have hundreds of services.
[01:48:53.865 --> 01:48:54.045]  We do.
[01:48:54.065 --> 01:48:57.486]  It's like you have a formula, it's well known, because people aren't telling people this.
[01:48:57.966 --> 01:49:00.667]  An average tax lawyer goes, oh, give us a thousand dollars, we'll meet with you.
[01:49:00.687 --> 01:49:02.167]  A couple thousand, we'll look at your problem.
[01:49:02.187 --> 01:49:04.308]  A couple thousand, we'll give you the advice.
[01:49:04.348 --> 01:49:05.448]  No, you just cut right to the chase.
[01:49:05.868 --> 01:49:06.448]  That's right Alex.
[01:49:06.468 --> 01:49:15.034]  So again, as I was saying before, everyone's tax situation is unique, but our tax attorneys are able to cut through the BS and get right to what matters.
[01:49:15.334 --> 01:49:24.080]  Because, as I've said before, there are a plethora of different tax issues you could have, but it comes down to basically one of three things, right?
[01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:30.233]   You either need The past, which means you already owe money and they're knocking on your door.
[01:49:30.293 --> 01:49:32.134]  Maybe they filed a lien against you.
[01:49:32.174 --> 01:49:33.635]  They're garnishing your wages.
[01:49:34.055 --> 01:49:36.076]  We can stop all of that immediately.
[01:49:36.096 --> 01:49:37.316]  You need to give us a call right now.
[01:49:37.356 --> 01:49:42.058]  We'll put an end to it because they're probably violating your rights and you don't even know it.
[01:49:42.418 --> 01:49:42.698]  Okay?
[01:49:42.717 --> 01:49:47.717]   because as I said before, the people that are there violating your rights are not attorneys
[01:49:47.717 --> 01:49:51.157]   and they don't necessarily even know or care that they're doing it until an attorney gets
[01:49:51.157 --> 01:49:55.597]  in your pocket and asserts what your rights are.
[01:49:55.597 --> 01:49:57.037]  Okay, that's the past.
[01:49:57.037 --> 01:49:58.037]  Let's say you already owe money.
[01:49:58.037 --> 01:49:59.877]  If you don't owe money, you have the present.
[01:49:59.877 --> 01:50:02.997]  That means you need to file for this current tax season.
[01:50:02.997 --> 01:50:06.037]   It means you want to pay the least amount of taxes as possible.
[01:50:06.037 --> 01:50:07.037]  So we got you there.
[01:50:07.037 --> 01:50:10.717]   But then also there's the future and that's for a lot of people out there that are doing
[01:50:10.717 --> 01:50:13.396]  good in business, the new of a reach.
[01:50:13.396 --> 01:50:14.396]  I just started a business.
[01:50:14.396 --> 01:50:17.077]  I'm making more than I made last year.
[01:50:17.077 --> 01:50:19.318]  These are the people that we can help.
[01:50:19.318 --> 01:50:24.197]   It's almost unfathomable how much money we can save you because if you just blindly go
[01:50:24.197 --> 01:50:29.238]   into a business without the proper tax planning, you're going to get your butt handed to you
[01:50:29.238 --> 01:50:33.917]   by the IRS and by the state because they don't care that you didn't learn this stuff.
[01:50:34.201 --> 01:50:35.001]  They just want their money.
[01:50:35.543 --> 01:50:36.083]  Well, that's it.
[01:50:36.383 --> 01:50:40.346]  You don't have a law degree, but they say, ignorance of the law is no excuse.
[01:50:40.446 --> 01:50:41.286]  So that's how they get you.
[01:50:41.866 --> 01:50:42.807]  That's absolutely correct.
[01:50:42.867 --> 01:50:44.468]  And the same thing the police would say too.
[01:50:44.948 --> 01:50:53.793]  But in this instance, you know, when you grow up, you learn right from wrong in a general matter that, oh, I shouldn't, you know, cross the street, jaywalk, that kind of thing.
[01:50:54.133 --> 01:50:58.636]  But you never learned in school the proper way to pay taxes, what you had to save, that kind of thing.
[01:50:58.676 --> 01:51:01.557]  And that's where it's not a total equivalency.
[01:51:03.038 --> 01:51:04.980]  Completely not fair for the middle class.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:10.166]  It makes me angry, but that's why I'm here to make sure I can get you the biggest discount possible.
[01:51:10.970 --> 01:51:14.812]  Well, what's frustrating is, I don't just get up here and promote stuff because you're a sponsor.
[01:51:14.852 --> 01:51:17.733]  I mean, I know with real tax attorneys, just look at the deal.
[01:51:17.773 --> 01:51:18.653]  They already have the code.
[01:51:19.614 --> 01:51:20.374]  It's so easy.
[01:51:20.414 --> 01:51:24.136]  They know what they're doing, but almost no one will do it because they want to milk people along.
[01:51:24.456 --> 01:51:27.097]  You want all the customers, just give them the great deal, move on.
[01:51:27.837 --> 01:51:28.218]  Absolutely.
[01:51:28.238 --> 01:51:29.478]  Jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:51:29.518 --> 01:51:31.419]  Jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285.
[01:51:31.639 --> 01:51:32.760]  And it funds the Infowar.
[01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:33.400]  A total 360 wins.
[01:51:33.420 --> 01:51:33.840]  Stay with us.
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:34.400]  Jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:51:38.712 --> 01:51:41.954]  So everything I'm promoting here is what I know is working.
[01:51:42.875 --> 01:52:00.609]   Every American, just like they own a toothbrush, or own a car, or own a hairdryer, or own a Utensils should know the tax code is written super complex so the establishment doesn't pay taxes and the general public does.
[01:52:00.749 --> 01:52:04.372]  This is one of the few ways we can fight back against the establishment.
[01:52:04.693 --> 01:52:05.774]  They're a great law firm.
[01:52:05.794 --> 01:52:07.215]  They have hundreds of people working for them.
[01:52:07.235 --> 01:52:09.717]  They're ready to service you now and support the show.
[01:52:09.837 --> 01:52:10.938]  A 360 win.
[01:52:11.278 --> 01:52:12.579]  Jonestaxrelief.com, 833-900-4285.
[01:52:15.842 --> 01:52:16.202]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:52:16.021 --> 01:52:21.021]   3 3 900 4285 and we have the owner and a tax lawyer Tyler Bennett.
[01:52:21.021 --> 01:52:24.621]   Tyler, talk about some of these services and why people should get involved.
[01:52:24.621 --> 01:52:27.021]  Because you're literally just leaving money on the table.
[01:52:27.021 --> 01:52:28.221]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:52:28.221 --> 01:52:35.101]   Let me talk about a huge concept in taxation and that is the idea of tax avoidance versus
[01:52:35.101 --> 01:52:36.900]  tax evasion.
[01:52:37.513 --> 01:52:39.274]  Because they sound pretty similar, right?
[01:52:39.514 --> 01:52:46.217]  Tax evasion is when you are going against the code, therefore breaking the law to pay less in taxes.
[01:52:46.537 --> 01:52:47.157]  It's a felony.
[01:52:47.257 --> 01:52:47.957]  You don't want to do it.
[01:52:48.278 --> 01:52:51.539]  Tax avoidance is literally the exact same thing.
[01:52:52.139 --> 01:52:57.324]  But now we're using the loopholes within the code to achieve the same result.
[01:52:57.824 --> 01:53:00.107]  And this is what the elitists and the people do.
[01:53:00.467 --> 01:53:05.452]  Because the tax code was written so that only the elite can get by.
[01:53:05.612 --> 01:53:11.337]  And what they do is they scare the normal people by saying, oh, if you under-report, that's tax evasion.
[01:53:11.577 --> 01:53:12.038]  And it is.
[01:53:12.338 --> 01:53:17.520]  Don't underreport, but that doesn't mean that there are other ways to lower your taxable liability.
[01:53:17.801 --> 01:53:19.561]  We know all of them and we will help you out.
[01:53:19.882 --> 01:53:35.729]  And it depends where you're at in your life, whether you're a W-2 employee, whether you are a crypto investor, whether you're a small business owner, that everything is bespoke because your situation is different and we will treat you accordingly to make sure you're paying the least amount of taxes.
[01:53:36.249 --> 01:53:42.714]  Basically, anybody out there, unless they're a big global corporation that's already not paying taxes, is going to benefit from calling you guys.
[01:53:42.834 --> 01:53:46.277]  Yeah, I don't think Apple needs our help, but everyone else does, and we got you.
[01:53:46.938 --> 01:53:53.383]  So you call, it's all confidential with the lawyers, so it's attorney-client privilege, you tell them your info, give it to them, they give you a prospectus, and then it's boom.
[01:53:54.335 --> 01:53:55.136]  That's absolutely right.
[01:53:55.196 --> 01:53:57.218]  So if you call us, we will talk to you.
[01:53:57.518 --> 01:54:02.742]  We're not one of those, you know, bait-and-switch type companies that you're going to call us and take money from you.
[01:54:02.782 --> 01:54:04.344]  We want to hear your situation.
[01:54:04.764 --> 01:54:14.052]  And so we will tell you exactly, after hearing your situation, what our individual solution for you, tailored for you, will be.
[01:54:14.152 --> 01:54:17.095]  And then at that point, you can decide whether or not you want to work with us or not.
[01:54:17.335 --> 01:54:18.356]  Well, here's my frustration.
[01:54:18.896 --> 01:54:21.619]  Listeners know that I only promote stuff I believe in.
[01:54:22.239 --> 01:54:25.681]  And I'm up here like it's a lottery ticket saying, learn about taxes, save money.
[01:54:26.601 --> 01:54:30.904]  You don't go to normal CPAs or normal lawyers or normal HR block and get this.
[01:54:31.184 --> 01:54:31.564]  That's right.
[01:54:31.604 --> 01:54:36.247]  I would not be on air now if I hadn't gone out and gotten tax lawyers that knew this stuff and I paid way more than I should have.
[01:54:36.287 --> 01:54:39.608]  This guy would have just instantly given us a prognosis and know what to do.
[01:54:40.249 --> 01:54:42.790]  That's what I've learned about your company, learned how to have some family use you guys.
[01:54:42.810 --> 01:54:44.071]  You just already know all the stuff.
[01:54:44.351 --> 01:54:45.612]  You look at it, you have a quick answer.
[01:54:45.632 --> 01:54:46.892]  And it's not a bunch of money.
[01:54:46.952 --> 01:54:48.073]  It's like part of what they save.
[01:54:48.173 --> 01:54:49.534]  I mean, that is what we need.
[01:54:50.154 --> 01:54:50.674]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:54:50.694 --> 01:54:54.815]  Well, it wouldn't make sense if what it cost was more than you would save in taxes, right?
[01:54:55.195 --> 01:54:57.756]  So, obviously, everyone needs to make money.
[01:54:57.796 --> 01:54:58.836]  That's what it's about.
[01:54:59.336 --> 01:55:03.597]  And so, what you were speaking about, you're alluding to is tax planning.
[01:55:03.877 --> 01:55:06.317]  These people start businesses, and I get it.
[01:55:06.357 --> 01:55:12.798]  When you start a business, all you're really concerned about is the bottom line and making sure you have revenue and that kind of thing.
[01:55:13.097 --> 01:55:21.417]   But you need to make sure you have a succinct tax plan in process here so that when you
[01:55:21.417 --> 01:55:26.337]   do make that revenue, when you do make that profit, you don't have to give it all back
[01:55:26.337 --> 01:55:28.057]  to the state and the IRS.
[01:55:28.057 --> 01:55:30.837]  Now I want to talk about state taxes for a bit.
[01:55:30.837 --> 01:55:34.796]   You guys are good out here in Texas, no income tax, but keep in mind in the states that don't
[01:55:34.796 --> 01:55:41.898]   have income tax, they are a lot harder in collecting the other types of taxes that they
[01:55:41.898 --> 01:55:42.898]  do levy.
[01:55:42.898 --> 01:55:45.018]  So keep that in mind.
[01:55:45.018 --> 01:55:52.057]   But where I am from in California, highest income tax in the 50 states, California and
[01:55:52.057 --> 01:55:56.377]   New York, and so a large chunk of the population lives in these two states.
[01:55:56.377 --> 01:56:01.577]   If you do, like me, listen, I understand your pain and I can help you pay the least amount
[01:56:01.577 --> 01:56:06.898]  of state taxes as possible.
[01:56:06.935 --> 01:56:09.496]  Okay, so let's talk about tax audits, okay?
[01:56:09.996 --> 01:56:21.098]  Listen, if the globalists, the IRS, the 60,000 agents that they just hired disagree with your numbers, then they're going to audit you, right?
[01:56:21.698 --> 01:56:29.300]  And that sounds like a really scary word, but it's only scary if you don't have the right representation in your corner.
[01:56:30.340 --> 01:56:35.343]  Uh, meaning a tax attorney, a professional that can help you out, or you actually do have something to hide.
[01:56:35.623 --> 01:56:44.708]  Well, most Americans that get audited don't actually have anything to hide, but they don't take the time because they don't know because they think, hey, I didn't do anything wrong.
[01:56:44.728 --> 01:56:47.350]  Do I really need the representation of an attorney?
[01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:59.258]   And you do because when you get audited, unless you know what to say, Accept and deny from the assessment that you receive.
[01:56:59.779 --> 01:57:05.324]  The IRS and the state dollars to donuts are going to charge you more than you actually even owe.
[01:57:05.745 --> 01:57:14.513]   And so unless you have an advocate in your in your corner to go back to them and say listen We looked at this audit.
[01:57:14.713 --> 01:57:15.854]  We were wrong about this number.
[01:57:15.874 --> 01:57:16.935]  We were right about this number.
[01:57:17.195 --> 01:57:19.497]  But this number is completely in left field.
[01:57:19.737 --> 01:57:20.737]  We're not going to accept it.
[01:57:20.757 --> 01:57:22.359]  They will assess that to you.
[01:57:22.679 --> 01:57:26.742]  And listen, if that's already happened to you, give us a call.
[01:57:27.082 --> 01:57:27.762]  We can help it out.
[01:57:27.822 --> 01:57:29.464]  Here's the thing about audits, right?
[01:57:29.944 --> 01:57:32.285]  Audits are kind of like treating cancer.
[01:57:33.246 --> 01:57:36.108]  You treat cancer as soon as possible.
[01:57:36.489 --> 01:57:39.671]  So the sooner you get there, the more easily treatable it is.
[01:57:39.751 --> 01:57:44.975]  It doesn't mean that it's not treatable just because you got to it late, but it makes it a little bit more work.
[01:57:45.256 --> 01:57:56.124]  So that means if you get an assessment letter, if you get an audit letter from the IRS or the state, you need to give us a call right now and we'll put that to bed before that assessment gets levied onto your tax account.
[01:57:56.144 --> 01:58:05.172]   And I want to be one trillion percent clear here, Tyler, because yes, I'm infomercialing To make money because our regular sales won't pay the bills because of supply chain breakdowns.
[01:58:05.632 --> 01:58:08.735]  More than half our supplements have been discontinued because we didn't lower the quality.
[01:58:09.195 --> 01:58:10.817]  Everything's made in China, we won't do it.
[01:58:11.377 --> 01:58:12.478]  So we're in trouble.
[01:58:12.538 --> 01:58:15.401]  So I go out and I start thinking, who do I know people already use?
[01:58:15.801 --> 01:58:16.982]  Who's already highly rated?
[01:58:17.423 --> 01:58:23.629]  Wait, wait, people I know have used a tax company, American Tax Solutions, and I call the guys a listener.
[01:58:24.189 --> 01:58:25.791]  It's like a month and a half ago, two months ago now.
[01:58:27.479 --> 01:58:28.620]  I met with you out in LA.
[01:58:29.281 --> 01:58:29.921]  Boom, it happens.
[01:58:30.822 --> 01:58:33.704]  I would rather die than screw somebody over.
[01:58:34.265 --> 01:58:35.586]  But it's not my opinion.
[01:58:36.046 --> 01:58:39.769]  Basic, hour-long consultation will save you across the board.
[01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:41.811]  It's written to screw you!
[01:58:42.391 --> 01:58:45.033]  It's like picking up gold bars off the frickin' beach!
[01:58:46.014 --> 01:58:47.476]  Apple pays no taxes!
[01:58:47.976 --> 01:58:50.739]  Amazon pays no taxes!
[01:58:50.779 --> 01:58:52.361]  They know their stuff!
[01:58:52.902 --> 01:58:54.584]  And they act like it's all magic.
[01:58:54.904 --> 01:58:55.184]  No!
[01:58:55.404 --> 01:59:00.971]  You don't have a company that will give you the codes to punch it in and put their name on it so they'll defend it.
[01:59:01.491 --> 01:59:04.174]  And this is one of the most empowering things we can do.
[01:59:04.454 --> 01:59:06.256]  We're not going to rob people for our revolution.
[01:59:06.476 --> 01:59:08.038]  We're not going to sell crack for our revolution.
[01:59:08.759 --> 01:59:11.982]  Our founding fathers robbed people to get money to win.
[01:59:12.022 --> 01:59:12.602]  I'm not against them.
[01:59:13.023 --> 01:59:17.828]  We're just getting you to learn about the tax code with lawyers and not pay most of it!
[01:59:18.228 --> 01:59:23.594]  And then we get part of the money, I stay on air, you get successful, they get successful, and we all win!
[01:59:23.934 --> 01:59:29.395]  That's right, Alex, and we're paying the least amount to the regime and the globalists that we don't support, and you don't support.
[01:59:29.455 --> 01:59:33.036]  Listen, I've talked to top senators, top everybody, and they go, listen, Alex, you're right.
[01:59:33.556 --> 01:59:37.477]  No money from the income tax, was 1913, runs the country.
[01:59:37.517 --> 01:59:43.839]  It's all the other taxes, and the power of a sovereign government, they're printing currency, and the military backs that.
[01:59:44.099 --> 01:59:46.459]  It's the defense budget's the real tax, folks.
[01:59:46.859 --> 01:59:49.260]  The military backs up the currency.
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:51.762]  It is not the damn income tax.
[01:59:52.022 --> 01:59:57.966]  The income tax is written to screw little people to keep small businesses down, a la the Great Reset.
[01:59:58.907 --> 02:00:03.010]  And you are shattering that, and if people don't call you, they're idiots!
[02:00:03.939 --> 02:00:11.780]  Listen, you gotta call us because we all know that the end goal of the globalists is to take all the money out of your pocket.
[02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:13.601]  It's bankrupting you, it's making you dependent.
[02:00:13.741 --> 02:00:21.602]  I want you to have a swimming pool, and have an RV, and be able to go on vacation three times a year, because if you're successful, I'm successful.
[02:00:21.882 --> 02:00:29.624]  They want the American system of prosperity to die, and knowing the tax system is the number one cheek in their frickin' honor!
[02:00:30.084 --> 02:00:30.864]  That's exactly right.
[02:00:33.035 --> 02:00:34.936]  Jonestaxrelief.com!
[02:00:35.256 --> 02:00:36.456]  Stop submitting!
[02:00:36.816 --> 02:00:39.097]  Jonestaxrelief.com!
[02:00:39.317 --> 02:00:39.817]  That's right!
[02:00:40.477 --> 02:00:41.317]  I'm serious, man.
[02:00:41.357 --> 02:00:42.177]  This is war!
[02:00:42.558 --> 02:00:45.858]  We the people should have access to that tax code right now!
[02:00:46.419 --> 02:00:46.799]  We should.
[02:00:46.899 --> 02:00:49.579]  And here's the thing, and here's why you need someone in your corner.
[02:00:49.639 --> 02:00:52.120]  Because you can go out there and try to learn the tax code.
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:53.801]  It's too complicated.
[02:00:53.881 --> 02:00:55.081]  But we know it, and we'll help you.
[02:00:56.201 --> 02:00:57.602]  I'm enough to crush these people, man.
[02:00:57.882 --> 02:01:02.425]  What assholes not giving the general public how rich people don't pay tax and poor people do?
[02:01:03.006 --> 02:01:07.229]  There are two sayings in Americana that are over 150 years old.
[02:01:08.129 --> 02:01:12.692]  No one knows who first said them, but everybody knows they're true because they ring true.
[02:01:13.773 --> 02:01:17.255]  You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
[02:01:19.017 --> 02:01:21.979]  And you don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
[02:01:22.970 --> 02:01:30.621]  You know, horse traders would look at the teeth of a horse and see how much time they had left, because after a horse can't eat its oats and its food, it gets sick and dies.
[02:01:31.563 --> 02:01:34.607]  That's like on elephants or any other animal, the teeth are the longevity of the creature.
[02:01:36.230 --> 02:01:38.053]  So, you don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
[02:01:40.319 --> 02:01:43.441]  And you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
[02:01:44.062 --> 02:01:54.308]  And folks, I love you to death, but there's nothing that pisses me off more than knowing we got probably three million people watching one way or another right now, and that less than 1% are going to call and do this.
[02:01:54.929 --> 02:01:55.669]  It funds us.
[02:01:56.330 --> 02:01:57.070]  It funds him.
[02:01:57.250 --> 02:01:59.972]  It funds you because they are screwing you.
[02:02:00.412 --> 02:02:14.082]   And if you just call and do a prospectus and let them know under attorney-client privilege, they will tell you whether you're a blue collar worker in a factory, whether you're a doctor, a scientist, a billionaire, You need to know these tactics, or obviously all the billionaires already know the tactics.
[02:02:14.102 --> 02:02:18.325]  So, Tyler Bennett, the services you've got are incredible.
[02:02:19.423 --> 02:02:39.775]  Bookkeeping, business counseling, business entity selection, estate and trust tax preparation, financial statements, IRS representation, payroll services, retirement planning, so key, sales and tax services, tax preparation and planning, tax levies and liens, oh that's the big where you can save money, wage and government releases.
[02:02:40.815 --> 02:02:41.996]  End penalties and interest.
[02:02:42.016 --> 02:02:42.797]  That's the biggest one.
[02:02:43.197 --> 02:02:44.718]  Tax negotiations and settlement.
[02:02:44.918 --> 02:02:45.599]  Almost as big.
[02:02:45.979 --> 02:02:48.021]  Reduce IRS tax fee.
[02:02:48.641 --> 02:02:50.082]  Resolve back taxes.
[02:02:50.323 --> 02:02:52.004]  IRS audit defense.
[02:02:52.104 --> 02:02:53.585]  Payroll tax negotiation.
[02:02:54.306 --> 02:03:01.390]   If I crimed in the octagon, With even a 150-pound top fighter, I get my ass kicked because I don't know what they're going to do.
[02:03:01.410 --> 02:03:03.052]  It doesn't matter I weigh 270 pounds.
[02:03:03.072 --> 02:03:05.693]  It doesn't matter I've fought and won some fights.
[02:03:06.133 --> 02:03:07.174]  These people are professionals.
[02:03:07.194 --> 02:03:08.115]  They're going to kick my ass.
[02:03:08.615 --> 02:03:09.416]  It's the same thing.
[02:03:09.856 --> 02:03:15.339]  You climb into the tax system and you don't have a real company, you're done.
[02:03:15.419 --> 02:03:15.920]  Explain it to them.
[02:03:16.638 --> 02:03:17.319]  That's right, Alex.
[02:03:17.720 --> 02:03:23.948]  So, the IRS and the state collectively, they are both that big bully in the ring.
[02:03:23.968 --> 02:03:29.075]  And unless you have a fighter that's going to go up against them, you're going to get pummeled.
[02:03:29.315 --> 02:03:31.218]  Let me tell you... You gotta know the punches they're going to throw.
[02:03:31.578 --> 02:03:33.400]  You have to know exactly the punches they're going to throw.
[02:03:33.780 --> 02:03:36.802]  And let me tell you some things we were able to do.
[02:03:37.163 --> 02:03:47.531]  For example, I had a client out in California who lost his job because he refused to drive his trunk while he was, he had been drinking at a bar and his employer said you have to drive.
[02:03:47.952 --> 02:03:52.395]  Well, he won a settlement from that suit and the state of California said, hey, that's taxable, right?
[02:03:52.415 --> 02:03:55.038]  And they were taxing 40% of the settlement he made.
[02:03:55.598 --> 02:04:03.787]  Well, that settlement's not taxable because he won it under, you know, excuse me, a rights violation.
[02:04:03.807 --> 02:04:05.229]  Yeah, don't blame yourself for having real data.
[02:04:05.249 --> 02:04:05.950]  I'm going to remember it.
[02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:09.694]  I'm going to say, give me the, that's when people really know what they're doing.
[02:04:09.754 --> 02:04:11.636]  It's in your brain, not a teleprompter.
[02:04:11.837 --> 02:04:12.457]  Keep telling them.
[02:04:12.778 --> 02:04:17.457]   works faster than mouth. So anyways, so what had happened is I ended up writing
[02:04:17.457 --> 02:04:22.338]   to the California Franchise Tax Board explaining to them this award was not
[02:04:22.338 --> 02:04:26.697]   taxable and you know this is how the government works. They sent me three
[02:04:26.697 --> 02:04:30.528]  letters every month saying we're reviewing what you sent us.
[02:04:30.528 --> 02:04:33.797]   That means it actually went up to legal and we're doing some good work
[02:04:33.797 --> 02:04:37.168]   and so when they finally said... You said piss up a rope. That's exactly
[02:04:37.168 --> 02:04:38.457]  what we said. We've, what we've...
[02:04:38.543 --> 02:04:39.744]  Here's the law, bitch!
[02:04:39.904 --> 02:04:40.304]  That's right.
[02:04:40.344 --> 02:04:42.165]  You bureaucrats don't run stuff.
[02:04:42.706 --> 02:04:43.726]  We know what's going down.
[02:04:43.746 --> 02:04:52.192]  When we write a legal memo, we include in it the relevant tax law and IRC, that's the Internal Revenue Code, that pertains to the subject.
[02:04:52.613 --> 02:04:54.774]  And they ended up giving my client $250,000 back that he had paid in.
[02:04:57.576 --> 02:04:58.657]  All day long.
[02:04:59.138 --> 02:04:59.718]  All day long.
[02:05:00.159 --> 02:05:01.039]  I could go on.
[02:05:01.059 --> 02:05:03.462]  Because they have no respect for you if you don't know.
[02:05:03.982 --> 02:05:04.843]  That's exactly right.
[02:05:04.863 --> 02:05:06.144]  It's like you don't know how to speak the language.
[02:05:06.444 --> 02:05:08.086]  Well, it's like the DMV, right?
[02:05:08.106 --> 02:05:12.650]  Have you ever gone to the DMV and felt like those people just kind of have it out for you?
[02:05:12.690 --> 02:05:14.711]  They hate their job, so they take it out on you?
[02:05:15.532 --> 02:05:17.633]  Listen, these tax collectors are the same way.
[02:05:18.073 --> 02:05:23.194]  They're mad, because they kind of got a shitty job, and then they don't know the law.
[02:05:23.414 --> 02:05:31.796]  They ask, so if they break the law, it's then up to the legal department at the IRS, at the state, to decide whether or not they broke it or not.
[02:05:31.836 --> 02:05:38.858]  And if they broke it, unless you have a tax attorney firm in your pocket to assert your rights, they're just going to say, we're sorry.
[02:05:39.178 --> 02:05:39.438]  You know?
[02:05:40.598 --> 02:05:40.998]  Whatever.
[02:05:41.478 --> 02:05:54.963]  But the thing is, is we're able to say, no, those rights that you had as an American, as a taxpayer, because as a taxpayer, you have a Bill of Rights separate from the Bill of Rights, meaning you have right to representation and you have right to pay not a penny more than you owe.
[02:05:55.444 --> 02:06:00.946]  And so once we assert those rights for you, that's when they'll start sending you back a refund if you have paid in wrongfully.
[02:06:00.986 --> 02:06:01.766]  It's like magic.
[02:06:02.106 --> 02:06:05.247]  When you know it, it's like, oh, OK, you're in the know.
[02:06:05.267 --> 02:06:07.168]  It's like we're in the glasses and they live.
[02:06:07.648 --> 02:06:09.589]  But if you don't have the glasses, you're screwed.
[02:06:10.049 --> 02:06:23.878]  Absolutely, and especially in this post, or if you still want to call it, continuing pandemic economy that we live in now, the IRS has really used the hullabaloo to their advantage, where it's very hard.
[02:06:24.118 --> 02:06:27.740]  It was hard before for the layperson to get through and get any information out of them.
[02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:29.621]  Now it's damn near impossible.
[02:06:31.002 --> 02:06:39.173]  If you're calling an organization that's charging you money and you can't get through to them to figure out even why or what you owe, that's an issue, right?
[02:06:39.293 --> 02:06:40.134]  So give us a call.
[02:06:40.394 --> 02:06:42.898]  We have a fast track line to the IRS and the state.
[02:06:43.178 --> 02:06:44.099]  We'll get through immediately.
[02:06:44.119 --> 02:06:46.482]  We'll figure out what the problem is and we'll solve it for you right then and there.
[02:06:47.003 --> 02:06:50.706]  Again, there's a lot of types of businesses in law and in the taxes.
[02:06:51.466 --> 02:06:56.390]  Really, you know, kind of establishment companies that are slow and weird but do their job and charge you three times more.
[02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:59.352]  Scam companies that charge you five times more and drag it out.
[02:06:59.772 --> 02:07:02.154]  And then real companies that just cut to the chase and get it done.
[02:07:02.594 --> 02:07:03.374]  That's exactly right.
[02:07:03.774 --> 02:07:10.016]  And I do want to mention that, you know, of the plethora of tax issues, as I said, there was the past, the present, and the future, right?
[02:07:10.616 --> 02:07:17.578]  A lot of these things take a different time period of legal work that our professionals have to put in to get done.
[02:07:17.839 --> 02:07:18.399]  But that's the thing.
[02:07:18.419 --> 02:07:21.280]  Yeah, some of the stuff's complex, but for most people it's very simple.
[02:07:21.540 --> 02:07:27.441]  For most people, it is as simple as asserting the rights of which they did not know they had.
[02:07:27.461 --> 02:07:28.542]  They're like, oh, you got a settlement?
[02:07:28.582 --> 02:07:29.222]  That's not taxable.
[02:07:30.042 --> 02:07:30.703]  Exactly, right.
[02:07:30.723 --> 02:07:35.707]  You have the basics, like 90% of it's screw jobs and there's more complex stuff here.
[02:07:35.966 --> 02:07:41.086]   Alex, you'd be surprised how many people come to me and say, "Hey, I won this settlement
[02:07:41.086 --> 02:07:48.046]   for civil rights or for I was injured on the job and the IRS and the state are taxing me."
[02:07:48.046 --> 02:07:52.446]   It's in IRC 1 that that is not, that the first- And that's one of the tricks you've got.
[02:07:52.446 --> 02:07:53.525]  You've got thousands.
[02:07:53.525 --> 02:07:54.525]  We got thousands.
[02:07:54.525 --> 02:07:59.165]   That's just reading the actual code, believe it or not, and applying what the actual code
[02:07:59.165 --> 02:08:04.046]  says is half of the job because they don't even...
[02:08:04.046 --> 02:08:07.686]  The IRS goes off what's called the Internal Revenue Manual.
[02:08:07.289 --> 02:08:08.149]  The IRM, look it up.
[02:08:08.390 --> 02:08:12.193]  What it is, is it's based on the IRC, but it's interpreted by clerks.
[02:08:12.213 --> 02:08:12.553]  It's opinion.
[02:08:12.873 --> 02:08:17.257]  It's opinion interpreted by clerks, not actual attorneys.
[02:08:17.417 --> 02:08:20.419]  It's like a judge who said Trump is guilty of January 6th in a criminal.
[02:08:20.499 --> 02:08:22.361]  No trial happened, but it's his opinion.
[02:08:22.901 --> 02:08:23.721]  That's exactly right.
[02:08:24.362 --> 02:08:29.024]  But the thing is, the opinion of these revenue officers becomes the word of law.
[02:08:29.044 --> 02:08:31.105]  That's why I get so frustrated, folks.
[02:08:31.366 --> 02:08:32.706]  Everything I push is good.
[02:08:32.926 --> 02:08:33.367]  I love it.
[02:08:33.467 --> 02:08:34.467]  It's wonderful.
[02:08:34.547 --> 02:08:35.128]  It funds us.
[02:08:35.168 --> 02:08:35.828]  It's good for you.
[02:08:36.348 --> 02:08:40.250]  This, of everything we've got, is the best deal there is.
[02:08:40.851 --> 02:08:48.007]   Whether you're a small business person or an individual or a big company, Getting tax lawyers that don't screw you is so important.
[02:08:48.027 --> 02:08:49.348]  A lot of you probably have good tax lawyers.
[02:08:50.309 --> 02:08:52.550]  I mean, we would be bankrupt if we went with CPAs.
[02:08:52.570 --> 02:08:53.870]  We used tax lawyers the last few years.
[02:08:54.231 --> 02:08:54.971]  Thank God we're on there.
[02:08:55.271 --> 02:08:56.772]  Donutstaxrelief.com, 833-900-4285.
[02:08:56.792 --> 02:09:01.375]  Tyler Bennett, in closing, in the last two minutes, what's your closing statements?
[02:09:01.715 --> 02:09:05.557]  Well, I just want to say, listen, it's April 18th is coming up, tax deadline.
[02:09:05.657 --> 02:09:06.377]  You got to file.
[02:09:06.477 --> 02:09:12.120]  Otherwise, you necessarily are going to pay the regime more than you owe.
[02:09:12.421 --> 02:09:14.522]  So give us a call so we can make sure that doesn't happen.
[02:09:15.424 --> 02:09:20.386]  Keep going, tell people about the other services, because jonestaxrelief.com takes them to your full site.
[02:09:20.466 --> 02:09:21.146]  Absolutely.
[02:09:21.186 --> 02:09:23.867]  So that's just for current tax filing, right?
[02:09:24.387 --> 02:09:27.028]  As we said before, tax planning in the future.
[02:09:27.048 --> 02:09:35.070]  If you're making money, you need to give us a call so that we can make sure by the next quarter comes around and you owe quarterly taxes, you're paying the least amount as possible.
[02:09:37.071 --> 02:10:02.554]  The end of the tax year comes, we can use all sorts of tricks that the globalists use, such as shareholder loans, look that up, dividends, you know, all sorts of corporate W-2 structures to make sure you avoid what's called double taxation, which is this idea invented by the globalists to scare you away from the number one beneficial corporation, which is the C Corp.
[02:10:02.874 --> 02:10:04.035]  Oh, it has double taxation.
[02:10:04.215 --> 02:10:09.438]  That is the easiest thing to get around if you know what you're doing, and we know what we're doing, and you will not get taxed twice.
[02:10:09.759 --> 02:10:10.059]  Okay?
[02:10:10.559 --> 02:10:15.462]  And if you already owe money, give us a call because I guarantee you they're violating your rights.
[02:10:15.723 --> 02:10:17.304]  They're probably garnishing your wages.
[02:10:17.564 --> 02:10:24.769]  They're probably knocking on your door saying they're going to take your property when your kids are answering the door to an IRS revenue agent or someone from the state.
[02:10:25.089 --> 02:10:27.470]  If that's happening to you, they're violating your rights.
[02:10:27.710 --> 02:10:28.391]  Give me a call.
[02:10:28.571 --> 02:10:30.052]  It makes me angry just thinking about it.
[02:10:30.232 --> 02:10:31.033]  We will help you out.
[02:10:31.333 --> 02:10:32.834]  I got people standing by right now.
[02:10:33.174 --> 02:10:34.615]  Don't give your money to the globalists.
[02:10:34.976 --> 02:10:37.976]  Help the people out that support your ideals.
[02:10:37.976 --> 02:10:38.976]  Tell her about it.
[02:10:38.976 --> 02:10:39.976]  Great point.
[02:10:39.976 --> 02:10:44.056]   The founder and head of tax professionals, the great American tax solutions company.
[02:10:44.056 --> 02:10:48.335]   You find all their products at Jones tax relief dot com that funds us as well as sponsorship
[02:10:48.335 --> 02:10:53.855]  don't tax relief Jones tax relief dot com or 833-900-4285.
[02:10:53.855 --> 02:10:56.896]   And I just really appreciate you and your wife and family coming to visit us.
[02:10:57.413 --> 02:10:58.794]  And we're going to come up in the next hour.
[02:10:58.814 --> 02:11:00.995]  We've got a great guest host that's getting ready to take over.
[02:11:02.015 --> 02:11:06.516]  The mighty Gerald Cilente and then Owen Troyer at 3 p.m.
[02:11:06.576 --> 02:11:11.398]  Central Standard Time with a warm, what a time to be alive.
[02:11:11.418 --> 02:11:17.420]  One of the big chinks of the armor, as I said, is that the average tax lawyer or the average CPA won't tell you this stuff.
[02:11:18.100 --> 02:11:18.841]  This is all real.
[02:11:18.881 --> 02:11:19.521]  They sign off.
[02:11:19.581 --> 02:11:20.141]  It's certified.
[02:11:20.181 --> 02:11:20.781]  It's on them.
[02:11:21.222 --> 02:11:29.510]   And it is just A gold mine, a platinum mine, a uranium mine of freedom, and it's the biggest thing that people need to learn.
[02:11:29.610 --> 02:11:31.192]  Everything we do is about exposing the globals.
[02:11:31.612 --> 02:11:34.095]  Everything we do is exposing their secrets, how they operate.
[02:11:34.455 --> 02:11:35.336]  That's why we're doing this.
[02:11:35.376 --> 02:11:35.997]  Thank you so much.
[02:11:36.317 --> 02:11:36.778]  Absolutely.
[02:11:36.798 --> 02:11:37.739]  We've saved the people $20 million.
[02:11:39.107 --> 02:11:41.009]  Darryl Salente is about to take over.
[02:11:42.070 --> 02:11:44.072]  We are here talking about the tax code and the fraud.
[02:11:44.093 --> 02:11:44.753]  Here's an article.
[02:11:44.833 --> 02:11:50.520]  Don't forget crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, and gig dollars on your taxes.
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:55.926]  And we got Tyler Bennett of American Tax Solutions, jonestaxrelief.com, breaking this down.
[02:11:55.966 --> 02:11:56.526]  Give us the latest.
[02:11:57.387 --> 02:12:02.548]  All right, Alex, here's the thing about this, because this is a direct attack on the middle class, right?
[02:12:02.948 --> 02:12:23.676]   So the Biden administration has passed a law that says any of these intermediary cash companies such as PayPal, such as Venmo, such as Zelle, including resale sites such as eBay, Etsy, the like, Uh, the old rules used to be you could sell anything on those things or give money back and forth.
[02:12:23.796 --> 02:12:30.582]  And before you reached a certain dollar threshold or a number of transactions, you wouldn't be considered to be in a business.
[02:12:31.022 --> 02:12:33.164]  Well, the Biden administration has changed that around.
[02:12:33.224 --> 02:12:43.953]  Now, if you make one sale or a number of sales in it and it ends up being over $650, you now fit the requirements to be 1099 Kade, which is a merchant.
[02:12:44.633 --> 02:12:46.255]  So they're killing the underground economy.
[02:12:46.775 --> 02:12:53.462]  They're killing the underground economy in favor of giving the super wealthy tax breaks, right?
[02:12:53.722 --> 02:13:06.615]  So there's this thing called the tax gap that tax strategists have talked about for a long time, which is the difference between how much the IRS actually makes every year and how much they need to make to cover the deficit, right, every year.
[02:13:07.235 --> 02:13:10.639]  And there's about a trillion and a half dollars gap every difference.
[02:13:11.059 --> 02:13:11.439]  Every year.
[02:13:11.699 --> 02:13:23.982]  And the thing is this, is if we tax the globalists, if they paid their fair share, not even their fair share, just a percentage of their fair share, that would go away, and it would actually be in surplus.
[02:13:24.042 --> 02:13:44.509]   But instead, the White House wants to attack the middle class, and so they're saying, we'll close the tax gap because all these middle class people aren't reporting a $600 shoe sale here, you know, a $300 this sale there, a garage sale there, so they want to make sure They're screwing you over so that they can get by paying the least amount of taxes.
[02:13:45.729 --> 02:13:47.350]  And that's why I feel so good about this.
[02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:51.473]  Like, nothing makes me feel better than having a gun sponsor.
[02:13:51.493 --> 02:13:57.537]  Because I know some people, low percentage, will do something wrong, but it's good people are going to get it 99% of the time, protect themselves.
[02:13:57.677 --> 02:14:01.660]  Or selling a water filter that cleans out all the toxins in the water they admit are there.
[02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:11.643]   Or selling a supplement like vitamin D3 during a pandemic that we know really massively reduces the chance of getting sick or dying.
[02:14:11.643 --> 02:14:16.723]   And with this though, it's like so known that our tax code's a scam for rich people to not pay,
[02:14:16.723 --> 02:14:18.524]  and we got one of the best tax firms out there.
[02:14:18.524 --> 02:14:20.284]  This is just something everybody should call.
[02:14:20.284 --> 02:14:24.444]   Your people are really friendly, and whether you're a regular blue collar worker
[02:14:24.444 --> 02:14:27.643]  or some rich person, you guys have some real services.
[02:14:27.643 --> 02:14:33.284]   Absolutely, and let me just make a comment on that, because you're right, Alex, is the two things
[02:14:33.284 --> 02:14:38.123]   that allow a government, a state, to take absolute control of the nation
[02:14:38.123 --> 02:14:41.564]   is disarming them, taking their weapons, and taking their money.
[02:14:41.641 --> 02:14:44.303]  And they've already tried taking their guns, take their money, take their land, take their children.
[02:14:44.323 --> 02:14:51.206]  And now they're taking your money, and your land, and everything else, and like Charles Schwab said, Klaus Schwab, excuse me, you'll own nothing and be happy.
[02:14:51.446 --> 02:14:52.567]  You'll own nothing and have nothing, yeah.
[02:14:53.953 --> 02:14:59.417]  Tyler Bennett, you are kicking some major globalist New World Order arse, and we appreciate you.
[02:14:59.518 --> 02:15:01.539]  AmericanTaxSolutions.com is the main site.

[02:15:06.944 --> 02:15:16.391]  And brother, I'll just tell you, your sponsorship last few months, we would have been bankrupt now without you.
[02:15:16.411 --> 02:15:17.532]  We're right there on the edge.
[02:15:17.572 --> 02:15:24.017]   We're right there paying the bills, the tax, the censorship, and you have kept this crew The listeners.
[02:15:25.158 --> 02:15:29.440]  And tell people, what's the latest on the tax savings you've made versus what people have paid?
[02:15:30.961 --> 02:15:38.745]  Alex, since we've started working with InfoWars, we've saved the viewers of this program in back taxes approximately, over at this point, $20 million.
[02:15:39.345 --> 02:15:45.248]  What we've saved in future earnings is incalculable because we don't know how much money you're going to make in the future.
[02:15:45.308 --> 02:15:48.710]  All we know is you're not paying it to the globalists so they can take your rights away.
[02:15:49.050 --> 02:15:55.015]   So, like I said, if you owe money, if you need to file, Or if you're making too much money, give me a call.
[02:15:55.035 --> 02:15:57.497]  Those are all problems we will help you with.
[02:15:57.517 --> 02:15:59.320]  All right, Tyler Bennett, you are amazing.

[02:16:34.458 --> 02:16:41.784]  You got all these fake news articles out there that I got $10 million don't have that, that I got $20 million don't have that, that I got $100 million don't have that.
[02:16:42.264 --> 02:16:43.425]  I don't have that, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:16:43.445 --> 02:16:52.833]  We are maxed out to almost no reserves, trying to put out as many articles and videos and banned out video and millions a day watching that.
[02:16:52.893 --> 02:16:54.474]  And we're just such an oasis of truth.
[02:16:54.574 --> 02:16:54.975]  Thank you.
[02:16:55.981 --> 02:16:57.042]  We're keeping us on air.

[02:17:45.014 --> 02:17:46.174]  That takes you right to the sub page.
[02:17:46.033 --> 02:17:56.913]  Stay with us.
[02:17:56.958 --> 02:17:58.800]  Welcome to InfoWars.
[02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:02.042]  I'm very grateful to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:18:02.062 --> 02:18:09.127]  I admire everything that Alex does in the fight for freedom and liberty and justice.
[02:18:10.287 --> 02:18:13.330]  Those are words that are gone from the American dictionary.
[02:18:14.490 --> 02:18:17.592]  And just as they killed the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[02:18:18.133 --> 02:18:22.616]  So do what you can to support InfoWars because they're going to blackball everybody out.
[02:18:23.447 --> 02:18:28.289]  Matter of fact, they just got a word from Consortium News.
[02:18:29.610 --> 02:18:31.911]  And, you know, they do great work.
[02:18:33.232 --> 02:18:43.076]  Mr. Loria over there, and he came out with an article about how that train station incident over there in Ukraine, the Russians claim they didn't do it.
[02:18:44.017 --> 02:18:57.627]   And now they're getting threatened to be pushed off Facebook for writing an article that questions The narrative being shoved down our throats by the criminal gang.
[02:18:58.707 --> 02:18:59.008]  Yeah.
[02:19:00.088 --> 02:19:01.189]  This goes way back.
[02:19:02.169 --> 02:19:03.410]  Remember the maid?
[02:19:04.890 --> 02:19:05.431]  There he is.
[02:19:05.551 --> 02:19:06.131]  Joe Laurie.
[02:19:06.191 --> 02:19:06.411]  Yep.
[02:19:07.672 --> 02:19:08.492]  He's a great guy.
[02:19:09.372 --> 02:19:11.373]  And, uh, you're seeing what's going on.
[02:19:11.874 --> 02:19:16.796]  And this again, this is why you have to support the truth because they're going to rob it from us.
[02:19:17.489 --> 02:19:18.690]  I'm a trend forecaster.
[02:19:18.710 --> 02:19:20.410]  I've been at this for 42 years.
[02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:21.791]  Best-selling books.
[02:19:22.251 --> 02:19:22.731]  Trends 2000.
[02:19:22.811 --> 02:19:24.432]  Trend tracking.
[02:19:24.532 --> 02:19:25.692]  Far better than Megatrends.
[02:19:26.093 --> 02:19:27.073]  Time Magazine.
[02:19:27.553 --> 02:19:31.815]  Been publishing the Trends Journal since 1991.
[02:19:33.316 --> 02:19:37.837]  I'll put my trend forecasting track record up against anybody in the world.
[02:19:38.338 --> 02:19:41.179]  Show me a trend forecast and then we can start to talk.
[02:19:41.819 --> 02:19:45.581]  I'm only mentioning this because I'm a visionary.
[02:19:45.701 --> 02:19:46.261]  I look ahead.
[02:19:48.135 --> 02:19:50.436]  World War III has begun.
[02:19:50.456 --> 02:19:57.520]  If we do not unite for peace, we are going to die for war.
[02:19:57.540 --> 02:20:02.443]  I even had a nightmare about this, like Friday night.
[02:20:04.744 --> 02:20:11.048]  And it was like a famous person, but I don't know who it was, like an RFK or JFK, somebody from the past.
[02:20:11.708 --> 02:20:13.149]  And it was in an auditorium.
[02:20:13.169 --> 02:20:15.991]  And he said, World War III began.
[02:20:17.130 --> 02:20:19.011]  And the rest of the audience just ignored it.
[02:20:19.671 --> 02:20:24.154]  And I, you know, I raised my hand and I said, sir, I said, you know, I've been forecasting this.
[02:20:26.575 --> 02:20:28.636]  And then the topic changed again.
[02:20:30.617 --> 02:20:35.040]  Americans have no idea what a real war is like.
[02:20:38.561 --> 02:20:40.222]  Take a look at Dresden.
[02:20:40.282 --> 02:20:44.765]  Isn't it lovely after bombed out by the British?
[02:20:45.825 --> 02:20:48.707]  Killing all those innocent people in World War II?
[02:20:51.329 --> 02:20:55.092]  Berlin, as I said, was grander than Paris before it was destroyed.
[02:20:55.112 --> 02:20:58.134]  This is in ancient history.
[02:21:00.676 --> 02:21:02.558]  World War III has begun!
[02:21:04.537 --> 02:21:09.121]  The hatred that's going on in teaching us how to hate all Russians.
[02:21:09.701 --> 02:21:11.623]  Hey, you know how to ice skate?
[02:21:11.643 --> 02:21:13.504]  You know how to play soccer?
[02:21:13.544 --> 02:21:14.285]  You know how to do this?
[02:21:14.325 --> 02:21:14.905]  You're Russian.
[02:21:14.925 --> 02:21:16.186]  You can't play anymore.
[02:21:17.287 --> 02:21:17.527]  Yep.
[02:21:18.748 --> 02:21:19.309]  Dresden.
[02:21:21.330 --> 02:21:21.871]  Nightmare.
[02:21:23.892 --> 02:21:24.693]  One after another.
[02:21:25.954 --> 02:21:28.336]  We're hating the Russian people.
[02:21:28.956 --> 02:21:29.617]  And I love that.
[02:21:29.657 --> 02:21:33.580]  I love the line that Levi's is pulling out of Russia.
[02:21:34.835 --> 02:21:36.256]  2% of their business comes from Russia.
[02:21:36.276 --> 02:21:37.976]  What are you pulling out for?
[02:21:38.257 --> 02:21:39.197]  It's great that you are.
[02:21:39.237 --> 02:21:39.877]  What are you selling?
[02:21:39.917 --> 02:21:40.698]  Dungarees?
[02:21:41.078 --> 02:21:42.038]  Oh, no, Salenti!
[02:21:42.458 --> 02:21:44.139]  Those are blue jeans!
[02:21:44.479 --> 02:21:47.020]  And it shows you how low the world has gone.
[02:21:47.400 --> 02:21:54.563]  They used to have dungarees that Levi Strauss invented in the 1850s when they were mining gold out of California.
[02:21:54.583 --> 02:22:00.385]  And they needed some, you know, crummy, rough wear to wear so it wouldn't rip.
[02:22:00.845 --> 02:22:02.186]  And that's become the style.
[02:22:03.877 --> 02:22:20.128]  So what I'm saying is that you need to support InfoWars because they are going to take us to war and you will not hear any other narrative other than the crap that they're shoving down our throat.
[02:22:22.009 --> 02:22:28.374]  You look at the faces of these guys that are the mouthpieces.
[02:22:29.975 --> 02:22:31.216]  This guy Sullivan.
[02:22:32.336 --> 02:22:33.137]  Jake Sullivan.
[02:22:34.517 --> 02:22:37.139]  Oh, he's the security advisor or something.
[02:22:38.680 --> 02:22:40.701]  You look at this guy, Ted Price.
[02:22:40.721 --> 02:22:46.165]  The mouthpiece for the Department of Defense, one of them.
[02:22:47.266 --> 02:22:52.549]  And then you look at Joseph Goebbels and you put these three pictures together.
[02:22:52.569 --> 02:22:54.110]  There he is.
[02:22:54.150 --> 02:22:54.931]  There's Sullivan.
[02:22:55.411 --> 02:22:56.432]  And that's a good picture.
[02:22:56.512 --> 02:22:57.632]  But look at those eyes.
[02:22:58.253 --> 02:22:59.714]  Look at those dead eyes.
[02:23:00.674 --> 02:23:01.695]  And that guy, Price.
[02:23:03.336 --> 02:23:04.077]  Ted Price.
[02:23:06.152 --> 02:23:07.973]  And then you look at Joseph Goebbels.
[02:23:10.554 --> 02:23:11.855]  Picky loser, man.
[02:23:11.875 --> 02:23:14.136]  That's all they're doing.
[02:23:15.076 --> 02:23:19.458]  Hey, remember that guy Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction and ties to al-Qaeda?
[02:23:19.478 --> 02:23:21.199]  Look at that guy, iry, flushy.
[02:23:21.819 --> 02:23:22.880]  Throwing that crap out?
[02:23:23.060 --> 02:23:24.261]  How come he's not in jail?
[02:23:26.101 --> 02:23:27.142]  There he is, Goebbels.
[02:23:27.422 --> 02:23:28.142]  What did I tell you?
[02:23:28.743 --> 02:23:30.263]  And you'll get this guy Price, man?
[02:23:31.384 --> 02:23:32.224]  Look at those eyes.
[02:23:33.545 --> 02:23:35.446]  They're the same people telling us this stuff.
[02:23:36.243 --> 02:23:37.083]  To hate Russia.
[02:23:39.064 --> 02:23:40.945]  Again, I'm totally opposed.
[02:23:41.665 --> 02:23:43.866]  I'm totally opposed to Russia's invasion.
[02:23:44.947 --> 02:23:46.348]  They can handle it better way.
[02:23:46.368 --> 02:23:49.509]  I totally understand the why it happened.
[02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:53.811]  Yeah, look at these guys.
[02:23:55.492 --> 02:23:56.112]  Look at these guys.
[02:23:56.152 --> 02:23:57.412]  Look at the arrogance.
[02:23:58.353 --> 02:23:59.814]  Look at the arrogance.
[02:24:01.154 --> 02:24:01.534]  All right?
[02:24:02.215 --> 02:24:03.195]  There's your price.
[02:24:03.855 --> 02:24:04.916]  Not worth a penny.
[02:24:05.612 --> 02:24:07.413]  Not worth a penny, that's the price.
[02:24:08.614 --> 02:24:11.915]  Oh, by the way, this guy, you ready for this?
[02:24:12.376 --> 02:24:22.561]  All you Americans, all us Americans, freedom, peace and liberty Americans, the guy who was with the FOIA was a CIA guy before this.
[02:24:23.082 --> 02:24:23.542]  All right?
[02:24:24.302 --> 02:24:24.642]  All right?
[02:24:24.742 --> 02:24:25.703]  Grow the hell up!
[02:24:26.263 --> 02:24:30.506]  You got a CIA mouthpiece throwing out his crap!
[02:24:32.367 --> 02:24:34.908]  Oh, that's the other thing I see here all the time.
[02:24:35.441 --> 02:24:36.702]  Goddamn Russians, man.
[02:24:36.722 --> 02:24:39.083]  Their people can't fight.
[02:24:39.503 --> 02:24:41.225]  Their generals are over the hill.
[02:24:41.685 --> 02:24:43.506]  I'm hearing it one after another.
[02:24:43.526 --> 02:24:45.267]  And you know who I'm hearing it from?
[02:24:45.667 --> 02:24:47.028]  American Defense Department.
[02:24:47.548 --> 02:24:52.591]  Hey, hey, hey fat mouths, you haven't won a war since World War II.
[02:24:52.992 --> 02:24:54.172]  Why don't you shut your mouth?
[02:24:54.453 --> 02:24:57.134]  You couldn't beat a bunch of guys called the Taliban.
[02:24:57.154 --> 02:24:59.496]  What, 89,000 of them?
[02:24:59.896 --> 02:25:00.496]  There he is.
[02:25:01.897 --> 02:25:03.278]  Goebbels is back.
[02:25:04.318 --> 02:25:08.960]  Garibald's garbage shooting out of these clown boys' mouths.
[02:25:09.321 --> 02:25:10.981]  Oh, these guys are so tough.
[02:25:11.102 --> 02:25:11.682]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:12.222 --> 02:25:13.063]  Oh, yeah.
[02:25:13.523 --> 02:25:16.424]  But man to man, nothing.
[02:25:17.205 --> 02:25:17.625]  Nothing.
[02:25:18.906 --> 02:25:19.766]  Selling us hate.
[02:25:20.346 --> 02:25:21.287]  Selling us fear.
[02:25:21.707 --> 02:25:22.648]  Selling us war.
[02:25:23.348 --> 02:25:31.960]   Just as the American people saluted, bowed down, and took it up the you-know-what to fight the COVID war.
[02:25:32.521 --> 02:25:35.123]  They will fight World War III.
[02:25:35.323 --> 02:25:40.427]  And again, Americans have no idea, no idea how bad it'll be.
[02:25:41.108 --> 02:25:48.093]  I was a keynote speaker at VMI, Virginia Military Institute, in 2000, talking about new millennium warfare.
[02:25:48.113 --> 02:25:48.574]  There he is.
[02:25:49.034 --> 02:25:49.995]  Could you believe these guys?
[02:25:50.575 --> 02:25:51.476]  Goebbels is back.
[02:25:51.816 --> 02:25:53.258]  Goebbels is back in town.
[02:25:54.058 --> 02:25:55.940]  Just a different name and a different clown.
[02:25:56.966 --> 02:25:57.707]  Look at the eyes.
[02:25:57.787 --> 02:25:58.648]  Look at the hatred.
[02:25:59.368 --> 02:25:59.809]  Look at him!
[02:26:01.210 --> 02:26:03.212]  Telling us what to do and what to swallow.
[02:26:03.652 --> 02:26:04.953]  Swallow my crap!
[02:26:05.614 --> 02:26:07.575]  Swallow my crap!
[02:26:08.276 --> 02:26:09.938]  I'm the spokesperson!
[02:26:11.109 --> 02:26:13.170]  For the murderers incorporated!
[02:26:13.491 --> 02:26:15.352]  What was your favorite war, Solenti?
[02:26:15.632 --> 02:26:16.492]  The Libyan War?
[02:26:16.533 --> 02:26:17.873]  No, I liked the Iraq War.
[02:26:18.154 --> 02:26:20.675]  Hey, how about giving me the Syrian War?
[02:26:21.035 --> 02:26:22.016]  Hey, what about Yemen?
[02:26:22.056 --> 02:26:23.017]  What's a Yemen?
[02:26:23.337 --> 02:26:25.859]  Oh, you mean the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth?
[02:26:26.219 --> 02:26:27.540]  Well, we won't talk about that.
[02:26:27.900 --> 02:26:29.421]  Hey, look what's going on in Ukraine.
[02:26:31.642 --> 02:26:32.843]  Oh, Brown University?
[02:26:32.863 --> 02:26:33.423]  What do they say?
[02:26:33.463 --> 02:26:37.846]  Americans killed about, uh, since the COVID, since the war of terror?
[02:26:38.206 --> 02:26:41.533]   Only about a, uh, Nearly a million people or something, a little over that.
[02:26:43.215 --> 02:26:44.275]  We got to stop this.
[02:26:45.096 --> 02:26:47.438]  And you have to do it by supporting InfoWars.
[02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:50.061]  Their products are great.
[02:26:50.501 --> 02:26:51.882]  It's not like you're doing it for nothing.
[02:26:52.563 --> 02:26:56.907]  You're doing it for your health, physically, emotionally and spiritually.
[02:26:58.669 --> 02:27:02.052]  Again, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:27:02.853 --> 02:27:04.194]  This is the time of our life.
[02:27:05.051 --> 02:27:07.072]  And again, the Trends Journal is a weekly magazine.
[02:27:07.092 --> 02:27:09.273]  Last week was 185 pages.
[02:27:10.014 --> 02:27:17.278]  We're giving the people everything they need to know, want to know, and have to know to prepare, prevail, and prosper in these dangerous times ahead.
[02:27:18.379 --> 02:27:20.880]  So again, InfoWars and the Trends Journal again.
[02:27:20.900 --> 02:27:24.042]  And the loser is freedom, peace, and justice.
[02:27:24.602 --> 02:27:25.282]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:26.343 --> 02:27:28.464]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:28.965 --> 02:27:33.067]  Like Alex was saying about this whole COVID war and the vaccines and on and on.
[02:27:33.757 --> 02:27:35.358]  You know, the truth is there.
[02:27:35.418 --> 02:27:38.419]  Here, this is from Financial Times.
[02:27:38.919 --> 02:27:39.660]  Financial Times.
[02:27:39.720 --> 02:27:41.821]  This isn't a conspiracy theorist, right?
[02:27:43.161 --> 02:27:45.823]  This is a date.
[02:27:47.703 --> 02:27:48.304]  April 7th.
[02:27:48.824 --> 02:27:49.664]  Not ancient history.
[02:27:50.505 --> 02:27:51.205]  Here's the headline.
[02:27:51.645 --> 02:27:56.648]  Vaccine kings earn $100 million in pandemic pay.
[02:27:57.568 --> 02:27:57.848]  Okay?
[02:27:59.289 --> 02:28:08.646]   Chief executives of Pfizer, BioNTech, Moderna, Have shared more than $100 million in pay during the pandemic, reflecting a huge commercial success.
[02:28:10.987 --> 02:28:12.907]  The vaccines developed by their companies.
[02:28:13.707 --> 02:28:21.409]  Vaccines developed by their companies that... The money they got to do the research came from the governments.
[02:28:23.330 --> 02:28:23.810]  Look at the money.
[02:28:24.010 --> 02:28:27.971]  They call them vaccine kings, drug lords, vaccine kings.
[02:28:28.731 --> 02:28:29.851]  Call them what you want to call them.
[02:28:32.591 --> 02:28:37.134]  Drug dealers, they do deal drugs, and they get paid for them.
[02:28:37.854 --> 02:28:41.096]  And I love these signs out all over, vaccines free.
[02:28:41.457 --> 02:28:42.377]  They're not free.
[02:28:42.777 --> 02:28:43.858]  There we go, brawler.
[02:28:44.439 --> 02:28:59.408]  Oh, he called people that don't believe in the facts that this clown sold as having a 95% efficacy rate, and now you need four shots?
[02:29:00.489 --> 02:29:00.809]  Oh, yeah.
[02:29:01.721 --> 02:29:02.602]  You don't believe him?
[02:29:06.784 --> 02:29:09.126]  Remember that?
[02:29:09.146 --> 02:29:09.986]  95% efficacy rate.
[02:29:11.207 --> 02:29:13.809]  And now they're saying the fourth shot has what?
[02:29:13.989 --> 02:29:16.310]  About a four to seven week efficacy rate.
[02:29:16.350 --> 02:29:17.291]  But don't forget to get it.
[02:29:17.311 --> 02:29:20.373]  Hey, and how about all those clowns that got them, huh?
[02:29:21.054 --> 02:29:24.436]  Yeah, the Pelosi's, the Obama's.
[02:29:24.456 --> 02:29:25.857]  There they are.
[02:29:26.217 --> 02:29:27.638]  Chief Executives of M.R.
[02:29:27.658 --> 02:29:27.798]  Yep.
[02:29:29.040 --> 02:29:32.222]  100 million dollars in pandemic pay out of our pockets.
[02:29:33.222 --> 02:29:33.922]  And not free.
[02:29:35.243 --> 02:29:40.585]  So, what Alex is saying to you, you better get it in your head and understand it.
[02:29:42.066 --> 02:29:44.967]  We are, these are all the people that have gone down with it, right?
[02:29:45.608 --> 02:29:46.148]  Bye-bye.
[02:29:47.349 --> 02:29:47.989]  Freak out.
[02:29:51.811 --> 02:29:53.191]  Look at it.
[02:29:53.311 --> 02:29:54.592]  The New World Disorder.
[02:29:57.665 --> 02:30:00.128]  So the products that they're selling there could help you.
[02:30:00.428 --> 02:30:04.192]  Again, I take 18 supplements a day and vitamins.
[02:30:04.292 --> 02:30:06.274]  I haven't been sick now in two and a half years.
[02:30:06.314 --> 02:30:07.014]  Not going to lie.
[02:30:07.815 --> 02:30:13.961]  Oh, and all those clowns, as I said, they got the vaccinations like the Sean Pencilhead, the arrogant guy that said everybody should get it.
[02:30:13.981 --> 02:30:15.843]  You shouldn't even go into movie theaters without it.
[02:30:16.284 --> 02:30:17.024]  Oh yeah, he got it.
[02:30:17.445 --> 02:30:18.406]  Pelosi got it.
[02:30:18.906 --> 02:30:19.727]  Clinton got it.
[02:30:19.787 --> 02:30:20.668]  Obama got it.
[02:30:21.331 --> 02:30:27.095]  That Peter Schiff, and I think I spelt his name wrong, you gotta throw a T in there, from California.
[02:30:27.455 --> 02:30:32.538]  He got it, and the crap shooting out of his mouth is that, boy, I'm glad I got the booster.
[02:30:32.838 --> 02:30:33.939]  I would have been a lot sicker.
[02:30:33.959 --> 02:30:36.500]  Hey, fathead, I didn't get it at all, and I'm not sick at all.
[02:30:37.921 --> 02:30:39.562]  No, this is crazy stuff.
[02:30:40.302 --> 02:30:41.703]  Anyway, support InfoWars.
[02:30:41.723 --> 02:30:46.026]  I want to go back now to this war going on.
[02:30:49.005 --> 02:31:03.709]  You saw this on InfoWars about the fake intelligence that they said that Russia was planning chemical weapons to use chemical weapons against Ukraine.
[02:31:04.629 --> 02:31:09.050]  And that was reported on NBC that multiple U.S.
[02:31:09.931 --> 02:31:15.512]  officials, officials, official jerks admitted that it was false information.
[02:31:18.339 --> 02:31:20.200]  But we're only getting one side of the story.
[02:31:20.220 --> 02:31:21.521]  There's no debates on this.
[02:31:21.642 --> 02:31:22.442]  There's no debates.
[02:31:22.502 --> 02:31:23.603]  Debates aren't allowed.
[02:31:25.805 --> 02:31:27.246]  They are taking us to war.
[02:31:28.387 --> 02:31:32.270]  That story that they just put up there, that was hardly made in the media at all.
[02:31:33.451 --> 02:31:34.471]  They're lying outright.
[02:31:35.592 --> 02:31:36.453]  And who do you believe?
[02:31:37.013 --> 02:31:39.035]  You believe this guy, Zelensky?
[02:31:39.833 --> 02:31:49.438]  The guy that played a comedian before he became, he played a comedian on TV before he became the President of Ukraine, before he became the President of Ukraine.
[02:31:49.739 --> 02:31:54.782]  And he's always dressed up in that military drag that he got over there, that green look.
[02:31:56.362 --> 02:32:02.266]  And then you had the clown over there, Boris Johnson, going over to Kiev this past weekend.
[02:32:02.326 --> 02:32:07.869]  Boris Johnson, a clown that you can't, a cartoonist couldn't come up with a better figure than him.
[02:32:08.655 --> 02:32:09.495]  From the UK?
[02:32:09.795 --> 02:32:10.696]  Or is it the F.U.
[02:32:10.736 --> 02:32:11.676]  you-know-what-K?
[02:32:12.857 --> 02:32:20.620]  After this clown locked down the UK and had all these parties and he's been brought up on all these different charges, so he got the people's mind off it like that?
[02:32:21.340 --> 02:32:22.580]  Promising more weapons.
[02:32:22.900 --> 02:32:23.281]  You ready?
[02:32:25.982 --> 02:32:29.883]  NATO members agree to provide new and heavier weapons to Ukraine.
[02:32:30.203 --> 02:32:30.924]  Oh, great, man.
[02:32:30.944 --> 02:32:31.424]  That's great.
[02:32:32.204 --> 02:32:36.085]  Estonia urges big rise in NATO forces to defend Baltic states.
[02:32:36.566 --> 02:32:37.046]  Terrific.
[02:32:38.348 --> 02:32:38.688]  U.S.
[02:32:38.768 --> 02:32:40.770]  boosts arms shipments to Ukraine!
[02:32:41.570 --> 02:32:44.092]  And it admits training Ukraine fighters.
[02:32:44.112 --> 02:32:44.853]  There he is, Boris.
[02:32:45.293 --> 02:32:46.134]  Go back to Boris.
[02:32:46.154 --> 02:32:47.275]  I didn't see him.
[02:32:47.295 --> 02:32:47.635]  Look at this.
[02:32:47.995 --> 02:32:48.616]  Look at this guy.
[02:32:49.516 --> 02:32:50.137]  Look at this guy.
[02:32:51.317 --> 02:32:53.799]  It's a freak show in a country near you.
[02:32:53.819 --> 02:32:57.162]  All right, so it's one after another.
[02:32:57.182 --> 02:33:02.846]  All weapons going in there to increase the death rate.
[02:33:04.347 --> 02:33:05.888]  And that's all this is going to do.
[02:33:06.548 --> 02:33:12.029]   Meanwhile, China tells Brussels not to cling to U.S.
[02:33:12.229 --> 02:33:14.670]  as rift widens over Putin's war.
[02:33:17.611 --> 02:33:19.052]  This is from RT today.
[02:33:20.612 --> 02:33:30.556]  Russia's military action in Ukraine is meant to put an end to the U.S.-dominated world order Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has explained.
[02:33:30.637 --> 02:33:31.617]  I met him, by the way.
[02:33:32.603 --> 02:33:41.231]  Washington has been seeking supremacy by imposing ad hoc rules and violating international law, he claimed in an interview aired today.
[02:33:42.372 --> 02:33:53.362]  He was referring to America's attempts to impose its so-called, quote, rules-based international order, end quote, which have met with strong resistance from Moscow and China.
[02:33:55.083 --> 02:33:56.845]  Yep, and China.
[02:33:57.944 --> 02:34:00.927]  As I said, China tells Brussels not to cling to U.S.
[02:34:01.328 --> 02:34:03.230]  as riff-wides over Putin war.
[02:34:03.710 --> 02:34:04.471]  So here we go.
[02:34:06.533 --> 02:34:11.318]  Russia and China versus U.S.
[02:34:12.379 --> 02:34:13.080]  and NATO.
[02:34:13.100 --> 02:34:14.781]  And the winner is...
[02:34:17.265 --> 02:34:24.448]  Again, I hear these people shooting off their mouth about, oh, America, oh, yeah, oh, we're number one, the best military.
[02:34:24.769 --> 02:34:27.810]  You haven't won a war since World War II.
[02:34:28.170 --> 02:34:34.293]  I don't want to hear your crap about what a great military you are.
[02:34:34.913 --> 02:34:35.274]  Shove it!
[02:34:36.274 --> 02:34:36.654]  Shove it!
[02:34:37.655 --> 02:34:42.437]  By their deeds, you shall know them, and you cats keep losing.
[02:34:43.155 --> 02:34:51.519]  Stealing trillions of dollars of our dough, giving it to the military-industrial complex to kill millions of people.
[02:34:53.079 --> 02:34:56.801]  There he is, Smiley Lewis over there, Miley nothing.
[02:34:57.201 --> 02:34:57.961]  Look at him!
[02:34:58.561 --> 02:35:04.064]  Look at this cazón with those eyes drooping down to his mouth!
[02:35:05.384 --> 02:35:06.625]  Look at the losers!
[02:35:07.987 --> 02:35:09.168]  Call for peace!
[02:35:09.528 --> 02:35:13.289]  You pieces of war-mongering hatred people!
[02:35:14.410 --> 02:35:14.810]  Peace!
[02:35:15.610 --> 02:35:15.891]  Hey!
[02:35:16.431 --> 02:35:17.791]  Smiley over there!
[02:35:18.072 --> 02:35:20.333]  Jim, you're a guy named George Washington!
[02:35:20.833 --> 02:35:22.313]  No, maybe you forgot!
[02:35:22.894 --> 02:35:24.695]  No foreign entanglements!
[02:35:25.115 --> 02:35:27.476]  And he was on the front line fighting!
[02:35:28.056 --> 02:35:29.357]  All you generals!
[02:35:29.937 --> 02:35:34.419]  Put on your costumes and lead the charge or shut your mouth!
[02:35:36.260 --> 02:35:36.660]  Look at him!
[02:35:38.138 --> 02:35:39.198]  A Freak Show!
[02:35:41.739 --> 02:35:44.399]  Brought to you by Washington, D.C.
[02:35:44.419 --> 02:35:45.760]  We'll be right back.
[02:35:46.940 --> 02:35:49.420]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:50.181 --> 02:35:57.662]  And Alex was just saying, you know, all those products they're selling, particularly those coins and everything else, you know, protecting your privacy.
[02:35:58.442 --> 02:35:59.382]  It's so important.
[02:35:59.983 --> 02:36:01.063]  Our privacy is gone.
[02:36:01.083 --> 02:36:02.303]  Yeah, I don't carry a cell phone.
[02:36:03.214 --> 02:36:07.017]  I did work for the cellular telecommunications industry back in 1994.
[02:36:07.117 --> 02:36:08.719]  I've been following it since.
[02:36:09.559 --> 02:36:11.901]  You know, all the radio frequency radiation.
[02:36:11.921 --> 02:36:13.303]  You know, it's a reality.
[02:36:13.323 --> 02:36:16.725]  And now, of course, you know, they know everything you're doing, everywhere you go.
[02:36:17.406 --> 02:36:30.437]  Matter of fact, there was a study that came out a couple of months ago from the University of California at Berkeley, said if you hold a phone to your ear 17 minutes a day for 10 years, your chances of getting a brain tumor only increase by, I think, 60%.
[02:36:32.674 --> 02:36:34.714]  And again, they're following everything that we're doing.
[02:36:35.315 --> 02:36:50.137]  And as Joe Duran, one of our writers for the Trends Journal says, is with his new book, We're Leaving Humanity, and it's the corrupt design of the technocratic elites, those technocratic elites that that Alex Jones talks about.
[02:36:50.458 --> 02:37:02.229]   So go to InfowarStores.com and get these products because They not only do they help you, they help keep the word of freedom alive.
[02:37:02.570 --> 02:37:03.973]  Look, I used to be on everybody.
[02:37:04.034 --> 02:37:07.021]  I got blackballed from Oprah, The Today Show, Good Morning America.
[02:37:07.041 --> 02:37:07.963]  I used to be on with all of them.
[02:37:08.755 --> 02:37:12.197]  And again, I just mentioned it was happening with Consortium News.
[02:37:12.597 --> 02:37:14.778]  My God, the people have been getting these great products.
[02:37:15.259 --> 02:37:19.781]  You know, you go to InfoWars stores and they're going to help you.
[02:37:19.801 --> 02:37:22.683]  And they got this is their last chance, by the way, for their blowout sale.
[02:37:23.163 --> 02:37:28.106]  You're getting up to 75% off these top selling products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:37:28.126 --> 02:37:29.706]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:37:33.837 --> 02:37:34.357]  Yeah, great.
[02:37:34.538 --> 02:37:37.239]  Emergency blowout sale, and we've got to blow them out now.
[02:37:37.579 --> 02:37:39.099]  You're getting a 75% off.
[02:37:39.479 --> 02:37:42.961]  And get to this before they run out of stock, because this stuff goes quick.
[02:37:43.561 --> 02:37:50.644]  You know, the markets, by the way, you know, the Dow is down, when I just looked the last time, it was down almost like 275 points or something.
[02:37:51.444 --> 02:37:56.166]  And the markets in Hang Seng and China, poof, way down today.
[02:37:56.186 --> 02:38:00.548]  Inflation is skyrocketing at levels we've never seen before.
[02:38:01.534 --> 02:38:07.459]  Gold prices now that they're shooting back up and they've been in the mid 1900 level for a long time.
[02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:10.742]  You know, I mean a long time, a couple of, you know, several weeks.
[02:38:11.362 --> 02:38:12.423]  And that's very important.
[02:38:12.463 --> 02:38:21.190]  And again, in the Trends Journal, our weekly magazine, if you want to know what in the world is going on, what it means, what's next, what do we got there?
[02:38:21.210 --> 02:38:21.190]  1952.
[02:38:21.230 --> 02:38:23.652]  All right.
[02:38:24.753 --> 02:38:27.555]  So that's what you got for gold right now.
[02:38:28.536 --> 02:38:29.817]  You know, this is solid.
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:31.401]  It's solid.
[02:38:32.622 --> 02:38:35.384]  And again, we've been forecasting this.
[02:38:35.424 --> 02:38:37.986]  This week's magazine, 185 pages, no ads.
[02:38:38.466 --> 02:38:42.049]  So again, if you want to know what in the world is going on, what it means, what's next.
[02:38:42.714 --> 02:38:45.655]  You know, you want the Trends Journals, TrendsJournal.com.
[02:38:46.255 --> 02:38:50.696]  It's the only magazine that you're going to read history before it happens.
[02:38:51.256 --> 02:38:53.677]  And we are the world leader in trend forecasting.
[02:38:54.077 --> 02:38:58.378]  And just as you support InfoWars to keep the truth alive, you know, support the Trends Journal.
[02:38:58.398 --> 02:38:59.879]  You know what this thing costs?
[02:38:59.899 --> 02:39:02.079]  It costs you like $2 a week, 29 cents a day.
[02:39:03.059 --> 02:39:07.481]  You read the New York Times, $3 a day, $6 on a weekend.
[02:39:08.121 --> 02:39:10.161]  The Wall Street Journal, $5 a day.
[02:39:10.681 --> 02:39:12.222]  We're giving you what nobody else has.
[02:39:13.267 --> 02:39:14.568]  Nope, there's no magazine like it.
[02:39:15.248 --> 02:39:20.750]  The whole history of what's going on now in Russia, we've started writing about this way, way back.
[02:39:21.370 --> 02:39:27.673]  And then going into 2014, how the US overthrew the democratically elected government of Yanukovych and on and on.
[02:39:28.273 --> 02:39:30.794]  So the markets are really in a critical place right now.
[02:39:31.294 --> 02:39:32.715]  And inflation is really hot.
[02:39:33.435 --> 02:39:34.696]  This is unprecedented.
[02:39:35.376 --> 02:39:37.357]  And I mentioned last week, I was down the city.
[02:39:38.115 --> 02:39:52.944]  And, you know, on the West Side Drive, you know, going north as everybody's leaving 515, there wasn't a car on the West Side Drive going north between the lights, between the traffic lights, you know, like six blocks, seven blocks as we're going east to look back.
[02:39:54.185 --> 02:39:59.648]  On the other Saturday night, we went out for dinner, a place called Pine Plains.
[02:40:00.268 --> 02:40:02.970]  It's about 25 minutes from here.
[02:40:04.351 --> 02:40:07.776]   Seven o'clock at night, we counted Eight cars.
[02:40:08.496 --> 02:40:09.117]  Eight cars.
[02:40:10.457 --> 02:40:11.017]  On this Route 199.
[02:40:13.258 --> 02:40:14.278]  The roads are dead.
[02:40:16.179 --> 02:40:19.320]  At nine o'clock at night, ten o'clock at night, the roads are dead.
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:25.361]  I go to top places for dinner, they're lucky if they fill up once.
[02:40:25.441 --> 02:40:26.802]  Maybe they get one and a half turns.
[02:40:26.822 --> 02:40:27.842]  You still need three.
[02:40:28.943 --> 02:40:30.263]  People can't afford to go out.
[02:40:31.846 --> 02:40:36.769]  The guy that owned, you know, a couple of dry cleaning stores, maybe four, got one.
[02:40:37.210 --> 02:40:40.131]  People aren't going out anymore because they're not going to work.
[02:40:40.171 --> 02:40:41.172]  They're not getting dressed up.
[02:40:42.493 --> 02:40:49.257]  The COVID war killed hundreds of millions of lives and livelihoods.
[02:40:51.079 --> 02:40:53.100]  Now I'm going back into inflation.
[02:40:54.421 --> 02:40:56.162]  Again, it's dead city near you.
[02:40:57.222 --> 02:41:04.725]  You go to New York, east side, west side, all around the town, for rent, for rent, for rent, for rent, for rent, for rent, for rent.
[02:41:07.466 --> 02:41:09.567]  And now interest rates are going up.
[02:41:10.047 --> 02:41:12.488]  What's that going to do to the housing market?
[02:41:13.509 --> 02:41:15.750]  I'll tell you where the big crash is going to come.
[02:41:18.211 --> 02:41:19.731]  Commercial office space.
[02:41:21.952 --> 02:41:39.751]   Right now, as we speak, Commercial occupancy rate of offices right now, office space occupancy rate, people going back to work is down 60% from where it was in 2019.
[02:41:40.492 --> 02:41:42.073]  All right.
[02:41:43.173 --> 02:41:43.534]  All right.
[02:41:44.554 --> 02:41:48.257]  All the businesses that depend on commuters.
[02:41:48.277 --> 02:41:51.299]  And this is real.
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:54.101]  Homeless everywhere.
[02:41:54.967 --> 02:42:01.593]  Everywhere, filth on the streets, rotten bridges, potholes everywhere.
[02:42:02.073 --> 02:42:03.054]  And what are we doing?
[02:42:03.955 --> 02:42:16.826]  Sending tens of billions of dollars, trillions of dollars a year to the military-industrial complex as America goes down the toilet.
[02:42:17.887 --> 02:42:19.048]  Down the toilet.
[02:42:21.170 --> 02:42:22.591]  Look what this country's become.
[02:42:25.339 --> 02:42:30.721]  An article, one after another, about how low this country's going.
[02:42:32.342 --> 02:42:38.464]  We had a big article over here in the Wall Street Journal last Wednesday.
[02:42:39.144 --> 02:42:43.106]  Buyers call for larger activewear sizes.
[02:42:46.647 --> 02:42:54.290]  This is a full-page ad from the toilet paper record in New York Times to the editors.
[02:42:55.228 --> 02:43:04.350]  Beginning this World Obesity Day, this is March 4th, we're asking you to eliminate the word obese from the news.
[02:43:04.770 --> 02:43:05.190]  Why?
[02:43:05.690 --> 02:43:09.710]  Because obesity is a chronic disease, not a lifestyle choice.
[02:43:11.831 --> 02:43:12.531]  You know what that is?
[02:43:12.831 --> 02:43:16.432]  I can't say the word, but it's BS.
[02:43:17.872 --> 02:43:18.672]  Look at the people.
[02:43:19.252 --> 02:43:20.592]  Stop eating this crap.
[02:43:20.912 --> 02:43:23.113]  Yeah, is there type 1 diabetics?
[02:43:23.713 --> 02:43:24.533]  Absolutely.
[02:43:27.452 --> 02:43:30.434]  42% of Americans are obese.
[02:43:33.636 --> 02:43:35.197]  Look what the roads look like.
[02:43:35.237 --> 02:43:39.400]  You go down any road anywhere in the country, it looks like the same crap.
[02:43:39.760 --> 02:43:49.166]  You got a Home Depot, a McDonald's, a Burger King, a Kentucky Fried Chicken, one chain after another.
[02:43:51.088 --> 02:43:52.789]  This country's going down.
[02:43:55.999 --> 02:43:57.920]  And they want you to go down with it.
[02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:04.942]  The products you're getting from InfoWars are going to help you not become one of them.
[02:44:04.962 --> 02:44:08.204]  This is the new normal now.
[02:44:10.385 --> 02:44:15.306]  When I was a young guy, I'm born in 1946, the height of the baby boom.
[02:44:15.647 --> 02:44:16.907]  They came back from the war, man.
[02:44:16.947 --> 02:44:20.148]  They just wanted to have a good time.
[02:44:20.168 --> 02:44:21.549]  They had all those babies.
[02:44:23.223 --> 02:44:26.504]  I remember one or two heavy kids in my class at a 40 and 50.
[02:44:26.925 --> 02:44:31.187]  You look at the pictures from Woodstock back in 1969.
[02:44:31.767 --> 02:44:33.708]  It didn't look like this.
[02:44:34.168 --> 02:44:43.772]  And they got these clowns coming up, these doctors, and all this stuff that, that obesity is not a lifestyle choice.
[02:44:44.793 --> 02:44:49.615]  Oh yeah, you're shoving down that crap down your mouth and you're saying it's, oh, there we go.
[02:44:49.635 --> 02:44:51.656]  That's not a lifestyle choice.
[02:44:52.985 --> 02:44:54.267]  America!
[02:44:54.527 --> 02:44:55.628]  America!
[02:44:56.309 --> 02:44:58.031]  Yep, down the crapper.
[02:45:01.314 --> 02:45:03.777]  If we don't unite, we are finished.
[02:45:05.358 --> 02:45:09.803]  World War III has begun, and not a peep about peace.
[02:45:10.203 --> 02:45:11.745]  Hey, the Pope got locked jaw?
[02:45:12.566 --> 02:45:13.627]  Where are all the religions?
[02:45:13.727 --> 02:45:14.408]  We'll be right back.
[02:45:15.842 --> 02:45:17.783]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:45:17.843 --> 02:45:22.505]  Remember, this is your last chance to get their InfoWars blowout sale.
[02:45:22.525 --> 02:45:23.626]  They're giving you off up to 75%.
[02:45:25.527 --> 02:45:27.568]  So again, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[02:45:28.128 --> 02:45:30.109]  Our future is on the line.
[02:45:30.650 --> 02:45:32.631]  And they've got these top selling products.
[02:45:32.691 --> 02:45:33.831]  So do what you can.
[02:45:34.512 --> 02:45:39.814]  And again, those coins, you know, as I mentioned, you're looking at gold prices now.
[02:45:40.395 --> 02:45:44.259]   You know, they're 19.55 an ounce.
[02:45:47.561 --> 02:45:51.904]  Inflation is going to take off like we've never seen before.
[02:45:52.925 --> 02:46:03.011]  And these products, you know, what you're getting them for and what they're worth and how much more they're going to cost, you know, the prices are going to skyrocket in a lot of them.
[02:46:03.755 --> 02:46:05.336]  And so they've given you what they can.
[02:46:05.496 --> 02:46:06.957]  So, so do what you can.
[02:46:06.997 --> 02:46:17.824]  Visit InfoWarsStore.com and get these bestselling items for up to 75% off before they run out of stock and avoid missing these massive savings.
[02:46:17.884 --> 02:46:21.986]  And remember, your purchase of these products is, it's a 360 win.
[02:46:22.707 --> 02:46:30.972]  You get super high quality items and, and you help launch the InfoWar to the next level.
[02:46:31.678 --> 02:46:34.119]  And they want to take us out to every level.
[02:46:35.099 --> 02:46:39.261]  They want their lies to be told and no truth to be heard.
[02:46:40.222 --> 02:46:42.142]  You know, think about truth and lies.
[02:46:43.163 --> 02:46:59.790]  If you, God, the God you believe in, believes in peace, if the religion that you practice believes in peace, you better stand up and fight for peace.
[02:47:00.874 --> 02:47:02.615]  Where are all these religions?
[02:47:03.536 --> 02:47:07.239]  You know, I launched the Universal Church of Freedom, Peace and Justice.
[02:47:08.300 --> 02:47:09.280]  Again, think about it.
[02:47:09.320 --> 02:47:13.343]  I got the domain name freedompeacejustice.com.
[02:47:13.784 --> 02:47:17.567]  Freedompeacejustice.com in 2021.
[02:47:18.146 --> 02:47:24.546]   If people cared about freedom, peace and justice, that name should have been taken in 1994.
[02:47:24.546 --> 02:47:34.386]   So where are all the religions uniting for freedom, peace and justice?
[02:47:34.569 --> 02:47:38.913]  We must stand up now for it, because all they're talking about is war.
[02:47:39.353 --> 02:47:45.939]  I read you the headlines of how they're bragging about sending more weapons to Ukraine to fight.
[02:47:47.920 --> 02:47:50.843]  Why aren't they sending peacekeepers to talk peace?
[02:47:52.395 --> 02:47:54.296]  And then you see all the people that are being killed.
[02:47:54.316 --> 02:47:55.376]  Yes, stop the war.
[02:47:55.416 --> 02:47:57.957]  You're not going to beat the Ukrainians.
[02:47:59.097 --> 02:48:01.758]  Excuse me, the Ukrainians are not going to beat the Russians.
[02:48:04.039 --> 02:48:14.302]  Again, Hitler killed up to, they say, 27 million Russians in Operation Barbarossa in World War II, and the Russians are the first to defeat the Germans.
[02:48:16.443 --> 02:48:19.404]  Napoleon, I mentioned this over and over again, marched to Moscow.
[02:48:20.586 --> 02:48:28.169]  Leaving Poland in 1812 with 420,000, 440,000 troops and came back with 10,000.
[02:48:29.570 --> 02:48:30.971]  We need to talk about peace.
[02:48:32.571 --> 02:48:33.432]  And no one's doing it.
[02:48:33.952 --> 02:48:34.272]  No one.
[02:48:34.972 --> 02:48:35.292]  I am.
[02:48:36.013 --> 02:48:36.873]  Infowars is.
[02:48:37.433 --> 02:48:39.935]  And by the way, we're going to have a rally.
[02:48:41.235 --> 02:48:44.256]  A freedom, peace and justice rally in Kingston, New York.
[02:48:46.177 --> 02:48:47.438]  Memorial Day weekend.
[02:48:49.299 --> 02:48:49.559]  May 28th.
[02:48:51.462 --> 02:48:52.482]  Put that on your calendar.
[02:48:53.503 --> 02:48:58.085]  At the most historic four corners in America, that I own three of the buildings.
[02:48:58.605 --> 02:49:07.369]  And this one is in that yard where you saw that shot from the church behind the Franz Rogenhaus.
[02:49:09.090 --> 02:49:12.971]  And the 1750s Franz Rogenhaus.
[02:49:13.191 --> 02:49:17.173]  I bought these buildings because the seeds of democracy was sown here.
[02:49:17.193 --> 02:49:19.194]  And this is the four corners of freedom.
[02:49:20.333 --> 02:49:22.194]  If we don't unite for peace, we're finished.
[02:49:22.775 --> 02:49:24.596]  Look at the clowns we got running the show.
[02:49:25.737 --> 02:49:26.638]  Look at the clowns.
[02:49:27.518 --> 02:49:29.039]  They talk about the atrocities?
[02:49:30.941 --> 02:49:32.502]  How about that guy Harry Truman?
[02:49:33.642 --> 02:49:35.704]  Yeah, Nakasaki, Fukushima.
[02:49:37.545 --> 02:49:39.226]  Bombs away the clowns.
[02:49:40.247 --> 02:49:42.028]  Clown Show, Cartoon News Network.
[02:49:45.571 --> 02:49:47.052]  No, we're in a crisis.
[02:49:49.178 --> 02:49:50.419]  So the Nasdaq is down 2%.
[02:49:51.400 --> 02:49:55.503]  Dow is down about 359 points when I left.
[02:49:56.423 --> 02:49:57.844]  The Nasdaq is down 1.57.
[02:49:59.265 --> 02:50:01.367]  They say it's going to be stagflation.
[02:50:02.948 --> 02:50:03.408]  It's not.
[02:50:04.669 --> 02:50:06.070]  It's going to be dragflation.
[02:50:07.071 --> 02:50:12.135]  Inflation is going to continue to skyrocket and the economy is going to drag down.
[02:50:14.636 --> 02:50:19.718]  When these interest rates go up, and they're saying how aggressive the Fed is going to be in raising interest rates.
[02:50:22.259 --> 02:50:23.039]  What aggressive?
[02:50:23.119 --> 02:50:24.759]  They raise them 50 basis points.
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:26.860]  We got inflation running at 7.9%.
[02:50:29.061 --> 02:50:38.684]  And the IMF says that your interest rate should be 1% over the inflation rate, which means that our real interest rate should be 8.9%.
[02:50:38.724 --> 02:50:47.723]   Not 0.25%.
[02:50:42.720 --> 02:50:47.723]  And if it goes up 50 basis points, 0.75%.
[02:50:48.103 --> 02:50:52.106]  Nothing.
[02:50:53.087 --> 02:51:07.598]  But even these rates increases, the economy can't take it because of all the cheap money that they artificially pumped into the market during the COVID lockdown, bringing interest rates down to zero.
[02:51:09.219 --> 02:51:22.944]  Negative interest rates in the UK, excuse me, in Europe, where your inflation rate is 7.5% and they have a minus 0.50% interest rate.
[02:51:23.624 --> 02:51:24.004]  All right?
[02:51:24.965 --> 02:51:25.585]  You got it?
[02:51:27.906 --> 02:51:31.447]  You know me, GCs, 3Gs, guns, gold and a getaway plan.
[02:51:32.498 --> 02:51:43.644]  And these silver coins, these 1776 silver coins are real currencies that you get from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:51:45.965 --> 02:51:50.367]  So again, you know, the motto of the Trends Journal is think for yourself.
[02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:58.191]  And they're just pumping more cheap dough into this thing to artificially prop it up.
[02:51:59.092 --> 02:52:00.232]  This thing's going to crash.
[02:52:01.033 --> 02:52:01.493]  Big time.
[02:52:02.091 --> 02:52:18.776]  We are going to go into the worst economic calamity in modern history just as we went into the worst calamity in written history with the lockdowns in a country near you to fight the COVID.
[02:52:19.697 --> 02:52:29.620]  Of which, again, according to the CDC, 94% of the people have 2.6 pre-existing comorbidities.
[02:52:31.565 --> 02:52:50.118]  Of the young people that died, again, about 700 in two years, out of a population, 700 out of a population of about 72, 74 million, 1 to 17 year olds, 61% had obesity.
[02:52:50.458 --> 02:53:05.334]   And I got these clowns in the New York, they're telling us that obesity is not a, yeah, yeah, there's type 2, type 1 diabetics, but boy, the way this country's blown up, You know, they used to say, pigs can't fly.
[02:53:05.354 --> 02:53:06.595]  Yeah?
[02:53:07.035 --> 02:53:08.936]  You been to the airport lately?
[02:53:08.956 --> 02:53:12.438]  They try to get into the seat.
[02:53:13.759 --> 02:53:15.320]  And they dress like pigs.
[02:53:16.420 --> 02:53:20.623]  When I was a young guy, everybody was dressed up fly, and it was nice.
[02:53:25.166 --> 02:53:30.869]  They're destroying this country, and if we don't have a peace revolution, we are finished.
[02:53:31.636 --> 02:53:31.936]  Done.
[02:53:32.376 --> 02:53:32.957]  Finito.
[02:53:35.038 --> 02:53:47.464]  Again, all these people that believe in your religion and your God, you tell me what religion and God you believe in, and tell me that that religion and God doesn't believe in peace.
[02:53:49.056 --> 02:53:50.797]  No one's speaking about peace.
[02:53:51.177 --> 02:53:52.698]  It's become a dirty word.
[02:53:53.078 --> 02:53:55.059]  More weapons, more weapons.
[02:53:55.379 --> 02:54:04.064]  That clown, that clown that they showed, that little fat boy with the fake blonde hair, Boris Johnson over there in the UK.
[02:54:05.544 --> 02:54:07.785]  More, quote, lethal weapons.
[02:54:08.606 --> 02:54:10.347]  Lethal, lethal, deadly.
[02:54:10.907 --> 02:54:11.887]  Kill more people.
[02:54:15.029 --> 02:54:16.750]  So anyway, you better prepare.
[02:54:18.780 --> 02:54:23.581]  And again, why people would keep, I got my money in a place where nobody's ever going to find it.
[02:54:24.182 --> 02:54:26.742]  Not near me, but around where I could go to it.
[02:54:27.263 --> 02:54:28.563]  I pull it out of the banks.
[02:54:29.163 --> 02:54:34.325]  I only have enough money in the banks to pay my bills, my, my, my business and my personal bills.
[02:54:35.665 --> 02:54:37.046]  Why would I keep my money in the bank?
[02:54:37.106 --> 02:54:49.149]   Ladies and gentlemen, we just, we could hear this one day, you know, the banks have been Cyber attacked and we're locking them down to protect your money.
[02:54:50.549 --> 02:54:55.390]  You'll get pennies back after we never give it back to you.
[02:54:55.810 --> 02:54:59.750]  And we give it back to you, it's not going to worth anything compared to what it used to be.
[02:55:00.631 --> 02:55:08.972]  So again, guns, my GCs, this is what I say, gold, silver and Bitcoin.
[02:55:09.372 --> 02:55:12.513]  Bitcoin's the wild card, but you know, you play them all.
[02:55:13.133 --> 02:55:23.346]   But to me, there's no greater, Safe haven assets than precious metals such as, and again, I don't give financial advice, gold and silver.
[02:55:24.046 --> 02:55:27.328]  And you get those great InfoWars 1776 coins.
[02:55:27.388 --> 02:55:30.029]  See you next week.
[02:55:30.089 --> 02:55:31.029]  Thanks for tuning in.
[02:55:31.289 --> 02:55:34.249]  TrendsJournal.com, the history before it happens.
[02:55:34.249 --> 02:55:43.929]  Please remember the only way we stay on air is your support.
[02:55:43.929 --> 02:55:48.609]   And I am extremely excited that a product that I thought I might have to discontinue
[02:55:48.609 --> 02:55:51.949]   because of supply chain breakdowns, because we get it from France through an American
[02:55:51.949 --> 02:55:53.929]  distributor is available again.
[02:55:53.933 --> 02:55:57.995]  Because I put the money in 11 months ago to get this, almost demanded it back a few months ago, and they said no.
[02:55:57.995 --> 02:56:00.874]   France is opening back up and the farm that makes it, you're going to get it.
[02:56:00.874 --> 02:56:03.395]  And they documented it over the last hundred years.
[02:56:03.395 --> 02:56:06.954]   It does better in a lot of different studies and tests than even over-the-counter antihistamines
[02:56:06.954 --> 02:56:07.954]  and things.
[02:56:07.954 --> 02:56:08.954]  It's all natural.
[02:56:08.954 --> 02:56:12.115]   It is the shells of a special type of quail, had a special diet where they learned it had
[02:56:12.115 --> 02:56:14.514]  a major anti-allergy effect.
[02:56:14.514 --> 02:56:16.354]  Helps support healthy sinus function.
[02:56:16.354 --> 02:56:17.755]  Helps enhance respiratory function.
[02:56:17.755 --> 02:56:18.755]  Alambloc.
[02:56:18.755 --> 02:56:20.915]  Promotes clear airway passages in normal breathing.
[02:56:20.915 --> 02:56:22.755]  Promotes respiratory health and normal breathing.
[02:56:22.755 --> 02:56:24.674]  Supports eye comfort and sinus health.
[02:56:24.674 --> 02:56:25.674]  Quail egg extract.
[02:56:25.674 --> 02:56:29.514]   Decades ago, researchers in France discovered the ability for certain quail eggs to alleviate
[02:56:29.514 --> 02:56:31.515]  season-related symptoms when eaten.
[02:56:31.515 --> 02:56:32.515]  And it is powerful.
[02:56:32.515 --> 02:56:35.875]   And despite the fact it will sell out before I ever get more of it in, I'm offering it
[02:56:35.875 --> 02:56:38.995]  out of the gates, 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:56:38.995 --> 02:56:43.595]   We're also going to end the sale at the end of the week for Pazzo Beets Heat Concentrate.
[02:56:43.595 --> 02:56:44.915]  It's documented so good for your heart.
[02:56:44.915 --> 02:56:46.235]  Breaks nitrous oxide in the blood.
[02:56:46.235 --> 02:56:47.674]  Wonderful for your cardiovascular system.
[02:56:47.674 --> 02:56:48.835]  Bites blood, clocks everything.
[02:56:48.905 --> 02:56:52.785]  That is back in stock, 40% off, and BioTrue Selenium sold out for more than eight months.
[02:56:52.905 --> 02:56:56.886]  From the mustard seed, the highest quality, very powerful, all your electrochemical activity.
[02:56:57.026 --> 02:56:58.887]  It's just like the iodine, but different.
[02:56:58.907 --> 02:56:59.707]  You need the two together.
[02:56:59.827 --> 02:57:00.827]  It is back in stock.
[02:57:00.987 --> 02:57:01.947]  It is 40% off.
[02:57:01.987 --> 02:57:09.287]   That sale is going to be ending on Monday or so, because we've already sold out a lot of the stock, and we're trying to, again, again reach our underages with things we don't have in
[02:57:09.287 --> 02:57:15.076]   stock anymore that people buy by selling out of the t-shirts and we had 63,000 t-shirts over the
[02:57:15.076 --> 02:57:19.746]   last few years I ordered and bid and never promoted or sold we had a lot of some t-shirts sold
[02:57:19.746 --> 02:57:23.086]   well some didn't we had a lot of them just building up some of the best sellers are there
[02:57:23.086 --> 02:57:26.765]   as well we're never going to reprint any We'll have all new shirts after this.
[02:57:26.845 --> 02:57:27.986]  And I appreciate everybody coming through.
[02:57:28.006 --> 02:57:30.388]  We've already sold out 20% of the stock.
[02:57:30.608 --> 02:57:33.091]  So in another week or two, we should sell out of all these t-shirts.
[02:57:33.111 --> 02:57:34.312]  Your last chance to get a member.
[02:57:34.352 --> 02:57:36.514]  We're selling them at cost at infowarestore.com.
[02:57:36.554 --> 02:57:37.595]  Thank you for your support.
[02:57:37.615 --> 02:57:38.076]  Stay with us.
[02:57:39.980 --> 02:57:58.173]  My guest is David Sinclair from VoltaWireless.com, and this is so great that we're having new endeavors in the private market startup to fight against big tech on so many different fronts, whether it's video platforms like Rumble or Bandop Video, and now tech companies like Volta that want to help you maintain your privacy.
[02:57:58.373 --> 02:58:01.054]  Go to VoltaWireless.com for more information.
[02:58:01.234 --> 02:58:08.797]  And even though the phone is pre-order right now, they ship out in May, you still can get the Volta Wireless services with the app and other things.
[02:58:08.877 --> 02:58:13.219]  Yeah, so you can go out to the site today, place an order for a phone, place an order for a subscription.
[02:58:13.299 --> 02:58:17.521]  What you'll be able to do is immediately download the app and start using the service right away.
[02:58:17.941 --> 02:58:19.862]  And what services can they use right away?
[02:58:20.041 --> 02:58:24.720]   Well, so immediately you'll get a Volta Private Number, which is essentially an anonymous phone number
[02:58:24.720 --> 02:58:27.041]  that you can use to make and receive calls.
[02:58:27.041 --> 02:58:28.460]  Nobody knows who it's assigned to.
[02:58:28.460 --> 02:58:31.761]   If you wanna keep your existing phone number, you can port that number over as well,
[02:58:31.761 --> 02:58:34.162]   and you'll actually be able to use both phone numbers at the same time.
[02:58:34.162 --> 02:58:35.322]  But you'll get the Volta Private Number right away.
[02:58:35.322 --> 02:58:36.961]  You'll also be able to order a SIM right away.
[02:58:36.961 --> 02:58:39.361]  You can download an eSIM, which is an electronic SIM.
[02:58:39.361 --> 02:58:40.400]  It's like what you use on your watch.
[02:58:40.400 --> 02:58:41.240]  You get the SIM.
[02:58:41.240 --> 02:58:44.240]   You'll also immediately right away get the encrypted communications, video calls,
[02:58:44.240 --> 02:58:46.081]  voice calls, messaging file transfer.
[02:58:46.081 --> 02:58:49.201]   You'll also get the VPN for encrypting all of your internet activity,
[02:58:49.201 --> 02:58:52.081]  and you'll get access to the mobile payments platform.
[02:58:52.081 --> 02:58:54.440]  And you'll get all of that for $39.99 a month.
[02:58:54.349 --> 02:58:57.791]  And, you know, right now... And that's the Volta Digital Nomad Package.
[02:58:57.971 --> 02:58:58.372]  Exactly.
[02:58:58.392 --> 02:59:02.274]  The Volta Digital Nomad Package gives you the unlimited talk, text, and high-speed data.
[02:59:02.354 --> 02:59:05.916]  We have other packages that will give you unlimited talk, text, and low-speed data.
[02:59:05.956 --> 02:59:10.439]  But what we find is most people aren't really happy with the low-speed data because most people want to be able to do something on the Internet.
[02:59:10.459 --> 02:59:14.441]  And the low-speed data is really designed essentially for people who only need to do talk and text.
[02:59:14.961 --> 02:59:15.161]  Right?
[02:59:15.581 --> 02:59:20.722]  So, if you want to be able to do stuff on the internet, you really need to do the high-speed data plan, which is the $39.99 a month.
[02:59:20.862 --> 02:59:25.844]  Right now, if you use the code ALEX, A-L-E-X, when you subscribe, you get your first month for $9.99.
[02:59:26.644 --> 02:59:29.284]  For most people, I would imagine this is probably going to even lower your phone bill.
[02:59:29.345 --> 02:59:30.185]  I know it would for me.
[02:59:30.205 --> 02:59:31.785]  This would be less than what I'm normally paying.
[02:59:31.945 --> 02:59:34.726]  VoltaWireless.com, again, is the website.
[02:59:34.886 --> 02:59:37.006]  VoltaWireless.com, folks.
[02:59:37.186 --> 02:59:39.327]  It's the cell phone for privacy for everyone.
