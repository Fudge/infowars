[00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:04.210]  We hit the barbed wire in February of 2020 and told you all this.
[00:00:04.731 --> 00:00:05.571]  We told you every day.
[00:00:06.231 --> 00:00:07.751]  That's why we're under attack because we do our homework.
[00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:11.073]  It's not about who gets the credit.
[00:00:11.093 --> 00:00:17.635]  You need to know why we're marked for destruction because I don't know why these guys don't get it ahead of the curve.
[00:00:17.675 --> 00:00:19.035]  I mean, Tucker gets lost without the curve.
[00:00:20.035 --> 00:00:22.596]  But why they've got to actually see it all later.
[00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:31.574]   The CDC and the FDA To cover their ass, put out a document in October 2020 predicting all the things that then happened.
[00:00:33.876 --> 00:00:41.002]  Because they want to later go back and say, oh look we warned you, the bureaucrats cover their dirty little butts.
[00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:51.210]  They did this on purpose, they set Trump up, and now we're just sitting there floundering around in circles.
[00:00:56.198 --> 00:01:01.009]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.432]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:01:06.992 --> 00:01:12.196]  Infowars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:17.479]  The American people demand that their first amendment be defended!
[00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.280]  The republic is rising!
[00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.263]  Well Alex, you're the gladiator and you keep on pounding the opposition.
[00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:23.823]  I love it.
[00:01:23.963 --> 00:01:25.104]  Alex Jones, nice guy.
[00:01:25.144 --> 00:01:26.085]  You've been demonized.
[00:01:27.306 --> 00:01:31.271]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:32.252]  Alex Jones.
[00:01:33.673 --> 00:01:34.034]  Alex Jones.
[00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:40.581]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier, promoting conspiracy theories.
[00:01:40.681 --> 00:01:44.826]  Alex Jones obviously is one of the conspiracy theorists whose brand is bullying.
[00:01:45.026 --> 00:01:46.527]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.429]  I have a right to face my accusers.
[00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:50.831]  And you, Congressman Deutch, are a liar and a fraud.
[00:01:50.911 --> 00:02:00.139]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadowbanning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[00:02:00.339 --> 00:02:03.302]  Hymbo Wars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[00:02:03.322 --> 00:02:06.945]  The FCC is cracking down on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:10.227]  InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[00:02:10.347 --> 00:02:17.853]  Yesterday, Apple, iTunes, Vimeo, and Spotify, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook have all blocked Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:02:17.893 --> 00:02:23.717]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[00:02:23.897 --> 00:02:24.938]  I want them shut down.
[00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:25.878]  I want them silenced.
[00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:26.719]  I want them muted.
[00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.620]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.141]  I want them shut down.
[00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:31.442]  I want them silenced.
[00:02:31.602 --> 00:02:37.205]   Alex Jones, which has now been taken off of Facebook, thank God, But who is the most banned news network in the world?
[00:02:37.505 --> 00:02:38.626]  InfoWars.com.
[00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:39.746]  InfoWars.
[00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:41.907]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:02:42.007 --> 00:02:43.147]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:02:43.187 --> 00:02:44.748]  What's happened with InfoWars?
[00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:48.209]  I would love it if you would follow up also about Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:48.929]  InfoWars.
[00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:50.049]  Do you watch InfoWars?
[00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.930]  President Trump is.
[00:02:51.832 --> 00:02:53.233]  The Infowars President.
[00:02:53.554 --> 00:02:55.115]  Trump appeared on Jones' show.
[00:02:55.195 --> 00:02:59.939]  He actually went on Jones' show and said... Your reputation's amazing.
[00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.700]  I will not let you down.
[00:03:02.341 --> 00:03:03.141]  Move, bitch!
[00:03:03.242 --> 00:03:04.483]  Get out the way!
[00:03:04.503 --> 00:03:05.844]  Up, up, and away!
[00:03:05.964 --> 00:03:07.665]  Swall as well.
[00:03:07.705 --> 00:03:10.247]  Why do you hate the First Amendment so much?
[00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:12.990]  There goes Congressman Swall as well.
[00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.290]  Google!
[00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.011]  You're going to lie again and violate the law?
[00:03:17.091 --> 00:03:17.831]  That's enough.
[00:03:17.851 --> 00:03:19.672]  You're making too much noise.
[00:03:19.692 --> 00:03:21.753]  That man's a threat at this point.
[00:03:21.793 --> 00:03:24.153]  I'd like to serve time.
[00:03:24.233 --> 00:03:26.674]  I'm getting pissed now.
[00:03:26.734 --> 00:03:29.875]  The new platformer didn't work.
[00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:33.416]  To me, it's all straightforward attack.
[00:03:33.476 --> 00:03:34.557]  That's the real power!
[00:03:34.737 --> 00:03:39.858]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:03:39.878 --> 00:03:41.059]  1776 will commence again.
[00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:52.564]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent free press working with big tech.
[00:03:52.604 --> 00:03:57.486]  We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down!
[00:03:57.326 --> 00:04:00.326]  if you want to come and take 'em!
[00:04:00.326 --> 00:04:06.326]  [music]
[00:04:06.326 --> 00:04:13.656]   We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that
[00:04:13.656 --> 00:04:14.326]  we've set.
[00:04:15.105 --> 00:04:22.591]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:26.674]  Growing concerns that the IRS is building an army of new auditors.
[00:04:28.447 --> 00:04:34.871]  When it comes to the Internal Revenue Service, the IRS, your first thoughts are likely about money and taxes, not tactical training.
[00:04:35.031 --> 00:04:38.994]  That's the kind of training, though, typically associated with the FBI or Secret Service.
[00:04:39.014 --> 00:04:41.956]  Yes, the tax man is also getting trained in a similar way.
[00:04:43.797 --> 00:04:46.839]  The Senate passed a sweeping tax climate change package.
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:56.646]  It hires 80-plus thousand IRS agents in the legislation to target blue-collar and middle-class people to shut down small businesses.
[00:04:58.891 --> 00:05:09.073]  An IRS internal report shows heavily armed agents practicing an all-out assault on a suburban home as part of their training exercise.
[00:05:09.273 --> 00:05:15.253]   These agents now carry firearms, they wear tactical gear, and according to a recent job
[00:05:15.253 --> 00:05:24.253]   posting at IRS.gov, internal revenue agents will now be authorized to use deadly force.
[00:05:24.253 --> 00:05:31.893]  We don't want them coming after you.
[00:05:31.893 --> 00:05:33.893]  Congratulations!
[00:05:33.893 --> 00:05:36.132]  (gunshots)
[00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:42.896]  They are putting everyone on a list to either be raided or arrested or charged with terroristic threats.
[00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:44.798]  That's what they're doing.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.162]  Bottom line, you don't want the IRS coming after you with this.
[00:05:51.423 --> 00:05:52.004]  Or with this.
[00:05:53.331 --> 00:05:56.553]  They are the kind of accountants that are prepared for anything.
[00:05:56.713 --> 00:05:57.434]  We're under arrest.
[00:05:58.214 --> 00:05:58.875]  You're under arrest.
[00:05:59.135 --> 00:06:04.859]  You're going to jail, buddy.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.321]  It's Wednesday, August 24th.
[00:06:08.341 --> 00:06:09.842]  The year is 2022.
[00:06:10.302 --> 00:06:15.826]  And I told you in the last few years it was coming.
[00:06:16.906 --> 00:06:17.807]  And I hammered on it.
[00:06:18.868 --> 00:06:20.529]  And I tried to warn people.
[00:06:21.536 --> 00:06:27.178]  But Trump didn't listen, and the poison shot was even more deadly than I thought it would be.
[00:06:28.338 --> 00:06:42.964]  Even though top scientists predicted everything that happened, I found it a little too bold when they tried to put in a regime of forced inoculation worldwide, and a worldwide medical ID to be tied to the carbon tax, the social credit score, and the universal basic income, all officially rolled out now.
[00:06:44.124 --> 00:06:51.747]  I thought they would have a placebo or something, or something that just didn't do anything, so they'd set the precedent and not have any bad effects.
[00:06:52.207 --> 00:06:55.969]  Instead, they went ahead and went right to the nanotech bioweapon.
[00:06:57.389 --> 00:06:59.790]  And now the Democrats are officially coming out.
[00:07:00.631 --> 00:07:09.294]  I have dozens of articles saying Trump is to blame for the poison vaccine, and the vaccine is a poison, and the vaccine is killing people.
[00:07:11.772 --> 00:07:30.981]  Trump absolutely, completely, and totally has been set up, and they were holding the economy hostage, telling him that he had to do all this if he didn't ram it through, and he rammed it through, and now he's like, well, you shouldn't kick the military out for not taking it, you shouldn't make kids take it, and it shouldn't be mandatory.
[00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:36.544]  That's good, Trump, but it's a day late and a lot of lives short.
[00:07:37.384 --> 00:07:39.205]  There's still time for Trump to extricate himself.
[00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:41.581]  And expose this.
[00:07:41.622 --> 00:07:42.422]  People say, well, who cares?
[00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:43.042]  Let him burn.
[00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:45.323]  He's getting a lot of good Republicans elected.
[00:07:46.404 --> 00:07:48.644]  He understood the new world order, the UN.
[00:07:48.704 --> 00:07:49.865]  He secured the borders.
[00:07:49.905 --> 00:07:52.226]  He stabilized the dollar.
[00:07:52.286 --> 00:07:54.647]  He made us the number one energy exporter again.
[00:07:55.968 --> 00:07:57.728]  The enemies of freedom hate Trump's guts.
[00:07:59.429 --> 00:08:08.793]  And that's what makes it so sad that he wouldn't listen to his advisors like Don Jr., who's been warning him, and Roger Stone, who's been warning him, and I've been warning him.
[00:08:10.563 --> 00:08:19.222]  Now last week I put out an emergency warning to the President saying, you're going to be set up by this, and the President reached out and said, why?
[00:08:19.322 --> 00:08:20.384]  Why are you so upset?
[00:08:22.182 --> 00:08:27.586]  And I shot another video over the weekend, an emergency message part two, explaining that you're being set up.
[00:08:28.246 --> 00:08:34.451]  And the left went crazy and thought I was currying favor with DeSantis or currying favor with Trump, that I'm a politico like them.
[00:08:34.611 --> 00:08:35.572]  I'm not a politico.
[00:08:36.232 --> 00:08:39.334]  I don't make decisions off of what it does for me.
[00:08:40.155 --> 00:08:43.717]  I make decisions off what it does to fight for humanity, which I'm a part of.
[00:08:43.938 --> 00:08:45.559]  That's how I operate.
[00:08:46.954 --> 00:08:51.137]  But both stories went viral, tens of millions of views online, and helped trigger a bigger debate.
[00:08:51.177 --> 00:08:59.102]  And that was my point by saying, Trump, I'm done with you if you don't come out against Fauci and Birx and Gazik and Gates.
[00:08:59.222 --> 00:09:01.404]  Now they have set you up.
[00:09:03.425 --> 00:09:06.387]  And that became really clear right when the vaccine was about to roll out.
[00:09:07.428 --> 00:09:10.190]  First, the Democrats were all for it, the so-called vaccine.
[00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.635]   And then right as it was about to roll out, They're like, we don't trust this.
[00:09:14.795 --> 00:09:15.856]  We don't trust Trump.
[00:09:16.236 --> 00:09:18.278]  We're not taking anything he comes up with.
[00:09:18.939 --> 00:09:22.962]  And I knew it was all a bunch of Democrat deep state people that were actually behind it in the whole history.
[00:09:23.302 --> 00:09:29.988]  I knew Trump had actually killed gain of function studies in 2017 when he got in and actually stopped a lot of Fauci's operations.
[00:09:30.628 --> 00:09:32.210]  So Trump did a lot of good things.
[00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:37.714]  And you know, he ran through monoclonial antibodies that worked great, didn't have any side effects and saved a lot of people.
[00:09:38.315 --> 00:09:41.077]  I had family on the edge of death, took it five hours later, they were better.
[00:09:41.938 --> 00:09:42.298]  Literally.
[00:09:43.422 --> 00:09:51.525]  So, it's a mixed bag, but we're going to open the phones up today on this subject because here it is.
[00:09:52.325 --> 00:10:02.088]  Politico, AP, all of them, Trump White House exerted pressure on FDA for COVID-19 emergency use authorization house report fines.
[00:10:03.389 --> 00:10:04.949]  Now, of course, Trump pushed warrants speed.
[00:10:04.969 --> 00:10:07.170]  That's not a secret, but they're already putting reports out.
[00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:08.610]  He's to blame.
[00:10:08.771 --> 00:10:09.871]  He's the problem.
[00:10:11.178 --> 00:10:20.382]  And you've got Walensky, and Birx, and Redfield, and Fauci, all of them saying it wasn't their fault, it's Trump's fault now.
[00:10:22.343 --> 00:10:24.744]  This is so obvious, we can see this from a mile away.
[00:10:26.144 --> 00:10:28.185]  And now, Trump is a sitting duck.
[00:10:29.186 --> 00:10:30.086]  This is disgusting.
[00:10:31.187 --> 00:10:36.509]  But the left's gonna have a problem, though, after they worship the shot as mammon from heaven.
[00:10:39.088 --> 00:10:43.111]  And now they're going to flip on a dime and the new thing will be Trump killed all these people.
[00:10:44.452 --> 00:10:46.054]  So it's Trump's tree.
[00:10:46.114 --> 00:10:46.854]  He's sitting in it.
[00:10:48.375 --> 00:10:48.916]  Unbelievable.
[00:10:49.516 --> 00:10:53.840]  Trump White House exerted pressure on FDA for COVID-19 emergency use authorization.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:58.704]  House report finds we're going to hit these reports in a moment.
[00:10:58.724 --> 00:11:11.275]   But first, there's a short compilation of the Democrats pre-positioning themselves Right when the vaccine was coming out, when Trump thought he was about to win re-election, and then as soon as he was out, then they said that they wanted to make it mandatory.
[00:11:13.012 --> 00:11:15.514]  You can see the moves they're making, plain as day.
[00:11:15.554 --> 00:11:15.954]  Here it is.
[00:11:16.395 --> 00:11:21.098]  I think it's going to be a very skeptical American public about taking the vaccine, and they should be.
[00:11:21.258 --> 00:11:28.704]  We can't trust the president and take his word and take a vaccine that might cause harm to us.
[00:11:29.004 --> 00:11:34.788]  If and when the vaccine comes, it's not likely to go through all the tests and trials that are needed to be done.
[00:11:35.108 --> 00:11:39.892]  Let's just say there's a vaccine that is approved and even distributed before the election.
[00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:41.033]  Would you get it?
[00:11:41.773 --> 00:11:44.934]  Well, I think that's going to be an issue for all of us.
[00:11:45.154 --> 00:11:49.716]  When we finally do, God willing, get a vaccine, who's going to take the shot?
[00:11:50.536 --> 00:11:51.677]  Who's going to take the shot?
[00:11:51.977 --> 00:12:01.241]  We will need to have access to the vaccine results so we can make our independent assessment to make sure that Donald Trump's fingerprints are not on it.
[00:12:01.481 --> 00:12:03.782]  You're going to be the first one to say, put me, sign me up.
[00:12:04.562 --> 00:12:05.842]  They now say it's OK.
[00:12:06.022 --> 00:12:07.223]  Is the vaccine safe?
[00:12:08.426 --> 00:12:11.990]  Frankly, I'm not going to trust the federal government's opinion.
[00:12:12.891 --> 00:12:17.556]  And I wouldn't recommend to New Yorkers based on the federal government's opinion.
[00:12:17.776 --> 00:12:22.141]  And the question of whether it's real when it's there, that requires enormous transparency.
[00:12:22.641 --> 00:12:23.843]  Would you trust that vaccine?
[00:12:23.903 --> 00:12:26.726]  There's very little that we can trust that comes out of Donald Trump's mouth.
[00:12:26.946 --> 00:12:31.392]  We cannot take for granted this process will be free of political influence.
[00:12:31.552 --> 00:12:32.934]  I don't trust the president.
[00:12:33.254 --> 00:12:35.277]  And I don't trust the FDA.
[00:12:35.517 --> 00:12:42.346]  If Donald Trump can't give answers and the administration can't give answers to these two questions, the American people should not have confidence.
[00:12:42.506 --> 00:12:53.550]  You're going to say to the American people now, here's a vaccine, it was new, it was done quickly, but trust this federal administration and their health administration that it's safe?
[00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:58.311]  I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump.
[00:12:58.351 --> 00:13:01.772]  How confident are you in the approval process of the FDA right now?
[00:13:02.093 --> 00:13:03.213]  How confident am I?
[00:13:04.053 --> 00:13:04.994]  I'm not that confident.
[00:13:05.194 --> 00:13:06.254]  Yes, I would be hesitant.
[00:13:06.474 --> 00:13:08.257]  But I'm gonna ask a lot of questions.
[00:13:08.677 --> 00:13:16.067]  You're going to need someone other than this FDA and this CDC saying it's safe.
[00:13:16.528 --> 00:13:19.712]  You've got to make all of it available to other experts across the nation.
[00:13:19.732 --> 00:13:21.314]  So they can look and see.
[00:13:21.895 --> 00:13:24.716]  So there's consensus this is a safe vaccine?
[00:13:25.176 --> 00:13:32.457]  What I'm worried about is that there's some sort of October surprise and that there's a pressure put on the decision makers here to announce the vaccine in October of 2020.
[00:13:32.517 --> 00:13:41.739]  We're going to put together our own group of doctors and medical experts to review the vaccine and the efficacy and the protocol.
[00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:47.600]  And if they say it's safe, then I'll go to the people of New York and I will say it's safe.
[00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:50.740]   But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I'm not taking it.
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:56.740]  [MUSIC]
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:04.459]   So for one month, six months before the election, there was an exact talking point that's now in your.
[00:14:05.171 --> 00:14:07.152]  That's when you know it's coming right from the New World Order.
[00:14:07.932 --> 00:14:18.558]  There was a word-for-word talking point by all the Democrat talking heads and CNN and ABC and MSNBC and the New York Times, the Washington Post, that we cannot trust this vaccine.
[00:14:18.718 --> 00:14:23.941]  And then suddenly they flipped and said, not only can you trust it, you should be made to take it just a few months later.
[00:14:25.285 --> 00:14:33.470]  They were putting that into the record, knowing people don't have a long-term memory, on average, to then bring it back later as the cover for what they did.
[00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.831]  Trump has a silver lining.
[00:14:35.971 --> 00:14:39.954]  He never said it should be mandatory, and he never said it should be for children.
[00:14:40.794 --> 00:14:46.098]  They immediately began to say it should be mandatory before he was even removed from office via election fraud.
[00:14:47.082 --> 00:14:54.028]  Trump needs to release all his communications with these people, how they came to him, how they recommended warp speed, how they said this would get the country going.
[00:14:54.849 --> 00:14:58.232]  Because we've seen pieces of those communications and we know they did it.
[00:14:58.832 --> 00:15:03.276]  Then they flipped once he took the bait and set him up, set us up.
[00:15:05.138 --> 00:15:12.204]  If Trump listens to me very carefully, if he listens to you, he'll be able to actually bring these people to justice.
[00:15:12.224 --> 00:15:14.486]  But they're intending to bring him down.
[00:15:15.782 --> 00:15:24.268]  With this, hit us with a bioweapon, hit us with their bioweapon shot, and then turn around and blame it on us, their main target.
[00:15:26.049 --> 00:15:27.450]  This is a big, big deal.
[00:15:27.510 --> 00:15:29.171]  Drew Hernandez is going to pop in and respond to this.
[00:15:29.191 --> 00:15:32.253]  We'll also have open phones throughout the broadcast today.
[00:15:32.634 --> 00:15:33.014]  Stay with us.
[00:15:32.833 --> 00:15:39.833]  this is a big big deal.
[00:15:39.833 --> 00:15:42.833]  Your phone calls, coming up.
[00:15:42.628 --> 00:15:45.150]  I'll get the toll-free number out in a moment.
[00:15:45.170 --> 00:15:48.071]  We're at a very critical inflection point right now.
[00:15:48.151 --> 00:15:50.453]  Please pay attention.
[00:15:50.773 --> 00:15:51.874]  InfoWars.
[00:15:51.713 --> 00:15:53.713]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:15:53.713 --> 00:16:06.152]  So I know PR when I see it.
[00:16:06.152 --> 00:16:16.153]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:16:07.443 --> 00:16:14.250]  I know pre-programming when I see it, and once you're conscious of the enemy's operations, what they're going to pull, what they're going to do becomes crystal clear.
[00:16:15.491 --> 00:16:20.255]  It's how I knew that they were starting a war with Russia and Ukraine over the last eight years.
[00:16:20.976 --> 00:16:21.757]  It's coming to a head.
[00:16:25.054 --> 00:16:29.535]  I looked up when the snow, when the ice melts in Ukraine.
[00:16:30.535 --> 00:16:35.456]  Then I called up some of my sources that I knew were already over in that area.
[00:16:35.476 --> 00:16:36.556]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:16:37.876 --> 00:16:42.117]  And I said, think there might be an invasion by the Russians?
[00:16:43.217 --> 00:16:44.677]  They said, yeah, by the end of February.
[00:16:45.938 --> 00:16:47.038]  I came on air and told you that.
[00:16:47.738 --> 00:16:54.379]  But I didn't need those sources to be able to tell you that.
[00:16:56.721 --> 00:17:00.484]  I mean, these are the people over there training Ukrainians how to shoot down Russian helicopters.
[00:17:01.665 --> 00:17:05.229]  When I got up here on air and I told you that was coming, it wasn't pulled out of the air.
[00:17:06.950 --> 00:17:13.376]  Now sometimes, the globalists are planning something, and we talk about it to try to stop it, and they change their plan.
[00:17:13.456 --> 00:17:14.277]  Then we're wrong!
[00:17:15.918 --> 00:17:16.879]  That's why we're only 95% accurate.
[00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:23.770]  And a lot of the things that we think we've been wrong about, later it turns out we were right about it.
[00:17:24.330 --> 00:17:27.150]  And I'm not saying that to say, oh, I'm smart.
[00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:44.013]  Once you know the new world order, and you've got all the deep state and all the Democrat leaders invested in the poison shots and Bill Gates involved, and they come to Trump and say, we can't ever end the lockdown because there won't be a vaccine unless you do this accelerated program.
[00:17:44.033 --> 00:17:47.954]  And they don't criticize him when he first announces it.
[00:17:50.014 --> 00:17:53.256]  And then right before it comes out, they go, he's to blame when it hurts everybody!
[00:17:55.938 --> 00:17:57.839]  And the talking point's the exact same script.
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:04.423]  Just like worldwide, they use the Build Back Better and the Great Reset as their campaign slogans.
[00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:08.505]  It's a global, New World Order, corporate, fascist party.
[00:18:08.525 --> 00:18:11.647]  I'll play a short clip, though.
[00:18:11.687 --> 00:18:15.209]  Trump's done this hundreds of times from the beginning, saying you shouldn't be made to take it.
[00:18:16.553 --> 00:18:17.513]  And things along those lines.
[00:18:17.593 --> 00:18:18.974]  So that's a saving grace.
[00:18:19.814 --> 00:18:23.196]  Because remember, it's the Democrats that tried to make everybody take it.
[00:18:23.496 --> 00:18:25.357]  And in many places like healthcare, they did.
[00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:30.319]  And across the world, they're beating people up and taking them to jail that leave their houses in Amman, Haddock.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:34.301]  Places like Italy and Australia and Austria.
[00:18:37.042 --> 00:18:37.662]  It's incredible.
[00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:45.286]  But now there's a House report that it was Trump made them put out the experimental shot and there's serious concerns about it now.
[00:18:47.384 --> 00:18:50.345]  Oh, no concerns for Pfizer or Moderna or Bill Gates?
[00:18:53.306 --> 00:18:53.586]  No.
[00:18:55.406 --> 00:18:56.527]  It's all Trump's fault.
[00:18:57.167 --> 00:18:59.067]  And it is kind of Trump's fault.
[00:19:00.048 --> 00:19:04.769]  He walked right into the trap.
[00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:12.091]  Absolutely walked right into the trap.
[00:19:12.411 --> 00:19:14.572]  And I'm not trying to throw the baby out with the bathwater here.
[00:19:15.728 --> 00:19:16.689]  The new order hates Trump.
[00:19:16.709 --> 00:19:17.350]  They want to take him out.
[00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.471]  That's why they set him up with this.
[00:19:19.993 --> 00:19:22.055]  Want to open the phones up, then what do we do?
[00:19:23.497 --> 00:19:25.499]  And you had DeSantis early on went along with it too.
[00:19:25.739 --> 00:19:30.485]  He just was smart enough to figure it out and started to remove himself from it in the last year and a half.
[00:19:31.426 --> 00:19:43.038]   I wish Trump would have done that, but now that he knows all this and isn't doing anything, He goes from somebody we can forgive, like Bolsonaro's never really pushed it, but he let him do it.
[00:19:43.518 --> 00:19:46.861]  He apologized six months ago and again a month ago and said, I am so sorry.
[00:19:47.321 --> 00:19:48.242]  I'm proud of my life.
[00:19:48.722 --> 00:19:49.903]  I'm proud of the work I've done.
[00:19:49.923 --> 00:19:53.706]  I never tried to hurt you on purpose, but I should have opposed this completely.
[00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:58.990]  This damn thing doesn't work and it hurts people and we should bring to justice those that are trying to force it.
[00:19:59.290 --> 00:20:05.735]  And they've got the UN and his own Supreme Court trying war crimes on him for opposing the shot being mandatory.
[00:20:08.168 --> 00:20:09.790]  Truth is, Trump took Pfizer money.
[00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:11.710]  They were one of his biggest donors.
[00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:20.869]  And they scripted it all where Trump would be the hero.
[00:20:20.869 --> 00:20:30.870]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:20:23.227 --> 00:20:24.008]  Look at these headlines.
[00:20:24.129 --> 00:20:26.532]  Well, first, let's play the clip of Trump saying it shouldn't be mandatory.
[00:20:27.304 --> 00:20:35.012]  Mike, do you mean a fully approved vaccine for everyone, the full public, or a partially approved vaccine with emergency use?
[00:20:35.032 --> 00:20:39.237]  No, we're looking for a full vaccine for everyone that wants to get it.
[00:20:39.297 --> 00:20:40.638]  Not everybody's going to want to get it.
[00:20:41.419 --> 00:20:43.281]  But we're looking at a full vaccine.
[00:20:43.321 --> 00:20:44.262]  Is that a correct statement?
[00:20:44.282 --> 00:20:44.382]  Yes.
[00:20:46.658 --> 00:20:48.158]  So the answer is, the answer is yes.
[00:20:48.218 --> 00:20:51.899]  We're working for a fully approved vaccine, but we'll also use the tools we have.
[00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:55.720]  For instance, emergency use authorization as appropriate.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:02.021]  We use all of our regulatory tools to bring vaccine available for the entire American population by January.
[00:21:04.241 --> 00:21:05.561]  Unbelievable, the double speak.
[00:21:05.921 --> 00:21:08.862]  Fully approved for emergency use, meaning not fully approved.
[00:21:09.562 --> 00:21:11.022]  Little word games right there.
[00:21:11.042 --> 00:21:12.882]  Decepticon activity.
[00:21:14.903 --> 00:21:16.023]  So Trump's in a pickle.
[00:21:17.281 --> 00:21:18.462]  Because the wheels are coming off.
[00:21:18.502 --> 00:21:42.317]  If you read the SPARS 2025-2028 document, that's really a battle plan, blueprint for attack, like a bank robber plan, but set years in the future, but it's really in the year 2020-2023, by the middle of the second year of the vaccine rollout, they admit it doesn't help you and hurts you, and then leaders get blamed and get in trouble for it.
[00:21:43.922 --> 00:21:45.303]  And there's a whole U.N.
[00:21:45.423 --> 00:21:47.485]  overhaul of medicine to make sure it never happens again.
[00:21:48.166 --> 00:22:01.657]  It has hundreds of tweets in it that then later, this was a year before they released the virus, they actually used on Twitter, the W.E.F., the U.N., word for word, they just changed the acronyms.
[00:22:03.559 --> 00:22:06.541]  So you just open the blueprint up every day and it tells you what you do today.
[00:22:07.522 --> 00:22:08.523]  It tells you what you do tomorrow.
[00:22:10.424 --> 00:22:13.625]  It's like our Air Force, the Strategic Air Command with the B-52s.
[00:22:14.105 --> 00:22:21.388]  They train on flying into Russia and dropping hydrogen bombs and launching hydrogen bomb-tipped cruise missiles.
[00:22:22.589 --> 00:22:28.591]  And they have battle plans, they have war games, and those war games are what they'll actually do when they launch an attack.
[00:22:28.671 --> 00:22:39.828]   Well, SPARS 2023-2025 2026 is an actual battle plan so the people carrying it out can go, oh no!
[00:22:40.968 --> 00:22:43.509]  FBI, if they did their job, or others, oh no!
[00:22:43.929 --> 00:22:45.410]  I just have this war game!
[00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.250]  We're not actually doing it!
[00:22:48.871 --> 00:23:05.750]   But just like with the nuclear forces, the war game for the submarines and the aircraft and the missile silos is the exact attack profile where they tell the submarine captains and they tell the B-52 captains and they tell the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Commanders.
[00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:11.071]  Launch plan 749836 Delta.
[00:23:11.872 --> 00:23:12.772]  Let's pull up that plan.
[00:23:12.851 --> 00:23:19.851]   Alright, primary targets initiate program, turn keys, launch!
[00:23:19.851 --> 00:23:26.851]  It's the same thing here.
[00:23:26.896 --> 00:23:29.157]  It's a damn playbook.
[00:23:30.526 --> 00:23:33.628]  And you can capture your enemy's playbook and not know what play they're going to play when.
[00:23:33.668 --> 00:23:34.469]  It's worse than a playbook.
[00:23:34.569 --> 00:23:39.412]  It's a choreographed script, like a Shakespearean play, these war games.
[00:23:41.154 --> 00:23:42.715]  And if they do this, we do that.
[00:23:43.295 --> 00:23:44.736]  And if we do this, they do that.
[00:23:44.816 --> 00:23:46.678]  And if this country comes in, we do that.
[00:23:47.678 --> 00:23:50.260]  And they've thought 30, 40 moves out, and I'm sitting there.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.281]  We do a three-hour analysis of it.
[00:23:52.542 --> 00:23:55.984]  The former head of Defense Intelligence Agency reads it and says, this is real.
[00:23:56.244 --> 00:23:57.225]  This is the battle plan.
[00:23:57.445 --> 00:23:58.306]  This is what they launched.
[00:23:59.741 --> 00:24:06.986]  Now he can't tell you all the classified stuff he knew or how he stopped Trump from authorizing the release of this stuff in China in 2017.
[00:24:07.247 --> 00:24:07.867]  General Flynn.
[00:24:09.148 --> 00:24:12.630]  But he can say, watch what Jones says, this is their plan.
[00:24:14.412 --> 00:24:18.595]  I don't need classifications to be the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency to see the enemy operation.
[00:24:18.795 --> 00:24:19.996]  It's all completely clear to me.
[00:24:20.696 --> 00:24:21.157]  Stay with us.
[00:24:22.278 --> 00:24:28.042]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:40.934]  And that's not bragging, that's a grim, terrible fact of the responsibility this operation has for the gifts God gave us of analysis and discernment.
[00:24:41.714 --> 00:24:44.996]  We will press the attack against the enemy until our dying breath.
[00:24:47.472 --> 00:24:51.933]  We ask you to hold us up in your prayers, your word of mouth, and your support.
[00:24:52.433 --> 00:24:59.274]  Joe Hernandez is joining us at noon to give his take on Trump and how the Democrats are now blaming him for the poison shots.
[00:24:59.314 --> 00:25:05.255]  But I want to give the toll-free number out on this issue and this issue alone.
[00:25:06.055 --> 00:25:07.455]  We don't screen your phone calls in.
[00:25:07.495 --> 00:25:08.836]  We're not going to control what you say.
[00:25:09.856 --> 00:25:15.957]  We want a clean phone line and then we want you to talk about that topic.
[00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:27.657]  We do free-for-alls a lot, but routinely, if you're a new listener, I want to hear from everybody on the specific issue of, who do you blame for the poison shot more?
[00:25:29.259 --> 00:25:30.000]  Who do you blame?
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.184]  The Wuhan, the Chai Koms, Bill Gates, Peter Daszak?
[00:25:34.724 --> 00:25:48.028]  Fauci, Obama, who in 2015 at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, their own scientist said they're creating super SARS bioweapon cross-species chimeric viruses, and Obama moved the project to Wuhan.
[00:25:48.808 --> 00:25:54.050]  But as usual, Obama isn't even in the discussion, or the people that control Obama.
[00:25:55.270 --> 00:26:13.154]   And we sit here chasing our tails, and now they've set Trump up, the populist movement, and the crew in seconds found the article on a new scientist from 2015 where they were warning of gain-of-function bioweapons.
[00:26:14.414 --> 00:26:19.917]  And if you try to talk about that, you get censored by big tech who's heavily invested in it.
[00:26:20.738 --> 00:26:22.419]  Lab-made coronaviruses trigger debate!
[00:26:24.124 --> 00:26:31.010]  The creation of gain-of-function chimeric SARS-like viruses as scientists discussing the risk of gain-of-function research.
[00:26:32.971 --> 00:26:35.293]  And they know hearings are coming when the Republicans get in.
[00:26:35.513 --> 00:26:37.135]  They know they're the ones behind it.
[00:26:38.055 --> 00:26:47.423]  And instead of Trump figuring that out and extricating himself, he sits there like a giant orange gremlin.
[00:26:47.443 --> 00:26:50.725]  And I mean that nicely.
[00:26:50.786 --> 00:26:51.806]  I call myself a goblin.
[00:26:52.827 --> 00:26:53.548]  He sits there.
[00:26:55.143 --> 00:26:57.644]  And lets himself be sucked into this black hole.
[00:26:59.184 --> 00:27:03.346]  Imagine if Trump comes out and says he was lied to and misled and calls for Fauci's arrest.
[00:27:03.626 --> 00:27:04.846]  He'll be hailed as a hero.
[00:27:09.128 --> 00:27:10.268]  Hey, I listen to the scientists.
[00:27:10.308 --> 00:27:11.149]  I listen to the doctors.
[00:27:11.589 --> 00:27:12.369]  Monoclonials.
[00:27:12.889 --> 00:27:14.750]  You know, Fauci wasn't for that, but I said do it.
[00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:15.350]  They work great.
[00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:17.671]  I had no idea they'd pull this.
[00:27:17.751 --> 00:27:18.271]  And he didn't.
[00:27:18.291 --> 00:27:23.793]  He's not a bioengineering, genetic engineering virologist.
[00:27:27.442 --> 00:27:34.665]  All right, I'm going to give the toll-free number out.
[00:27:35.326 --> 00:27:36.946]  It's 877-789-2539.
[00:27:36.966 --> 00:27:37.446]  877-789-Alex.
[00:27:37.466 --> 00:27:37.707]  877-789-2539.
[00:27:38.407 --> 00:27:44.529]  First-time callers, long-time callers, you agree, you disagree, I really want to hear what you have to say.
[00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:48.911]  The wild card of the people having a voice to millions of viewers and listeners.
[00:27:49.512 --> 00:27:50.092]  I just love it.
[00:27:50.112 --> 00:27:54.654]  We're going to take phones throughout the full broadcast today.
[00:27:56.089 --> 00:27:59.010]  Marjorie Taylor Greene told me she'd come on Wednesday.
[00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:00.070]  I talked to her Friday.
[00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:06.231]  But we haven't been able to get her on because she got SWAT team rated last night in a SWAT event.
[00:28:07.031 --> 00:28:07.991]  We have been SWATed.
[00:28:08.011 --> 00:28:09.192]  I have been SWATed.
[00:28:09.212 --> 00:28:12.432]  I never really talked about it because I don't want to encourage those that do it.
[00:28:13.053 --> 00:28:19.694]  But I've been SWATed five times that we know of.
[00:28:21.054 --> 00:28:24.075]  And the police just have my address in their database.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.161]  After the first time, they just know it's BS.
[00:28:27.181 --> 00:28:29.422]  They come knock on the door and they say, you got swatted again.
[00:28:29.442 --> 00:28:32.644]  And they went next level a few months ago.
[00:28:32.664 --> 00:28:33.765]  I haven't talked about this yet.
[00:28:35.746 --> 00:28:50.915]  But they filed, just so you know what they're up to, through a computer system out of Washington State, which means it was internally done, a fake arrest warrant out of Washington State, for yours truly, for raping children.
[00:28:52.363 --> 00:28:58.768]  We were contacted by the Travis County Sheriff's Department, my lawyer was, and they said they hit a bunch of other Texas counties.
[00:28:59.468 --> 00:29:00.850]  They've never seen that before.
[00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:07.395]  In their internal system, a Russ Warren, Alex Jones, a Judge Frost, that doesn't exist, signed it.
[00:29:08.095 --> 00:29:09.737]  There's a criminal investigation going on.
[00:29:10.117 --> 00:29:12.699]  They're pissed because it's not about Alex Jones.
[00:29:12.719 --> 00:29:15.862]  They're like, we got people filing fake arrest warrants now?
[00:29:16.463 --> 00:29:17.304]  How are they doing this?
[00:29:17.944 --> 00:29:18.965]  They still haven't figured it out.
[00:29:19.225 --> 00:29:20.487]  There's an ongoing investigation.
[00:29:20.507 --> 00:29:22.669]  And I'll just go ahead and tell you, it's not fun.
[00:29:23.169 --> 00:29:23.689]  Not of us.
[00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:24.610]  We're not being investigated.
[00:29:24.931 --> 00:29:26.692]  There's an ongoing investigation of whoever did this.
[00:29:28.974 --> 00:29:30.416]  Multiple child rapes.
[00:29:32.281 --> 00:29:38.582]  And you saw what trended on Twitter the last few days, and I don't have the money and I don't want to do it, but at a certain point I gotta sue people.
[00:29:39.537 --> 00:29:42.560]  They have Democratic Party operatives running headlines.
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:50.467]  Alex Jones' cell phone contained child porn, mixing it with the two-year-old fake story that we sent child porn to the Sandy Hook families.
[00:29:50.787 --> 00:29:59.355]  No, somebody who's pro-anti-gun, anti-Alex Jones, sent an email with hidden child porn links in it.
[00:29:59.916 --> 00:30:02.558]  They asked for all these key terms in Discovery.
[00:30:02.598 --> 00:30:03.699]  We gave them the emails.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.641]  Unopened emails.
[00:30:07.537 --> 00:30:13.518]  And then the news ran headlines, Alex Jones caught with child porn in documents he gave Sandy Hook parents.
[00:30:15.578 --> 00:30:20.799]  So, there's just no end to these people, and they're really pissed we're exposing their pedophilia.
[00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:25.740]  You have to understand, the people we're finding, they're pedophiles.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:31.281]  The large majority of the leadership of the people opposing us literally rape children.
[00:30:32.901 --> 00:30:34.622]  Just remember, that's who they are.
[00:30:35.362 --> 00:30:36.162]  And never forget that.
[00:30:37.574 --> 00:30:42.296]  That's why they're targeting children for gender reassignment, mutilation, all the rest of it.
[00:30:42.336 --> 00:30:45.078]  It's about destroying children and stealing their energy.
[00:30:45.498 --> 00:30:50.080]  That's what gets them big mojo with their God.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:51.861]  So again, 877-789-2539.
[00:30:53.001 --> 00:31:06.262]   I'm going to cover a lot of other news as well in between your calls and a lot of key clips, but the Democrats are coming out now and saying, Oh, we're not for this shot.
[00:31:06.762 --> 00:31:16.748]  Now that nobody's taking it, nobody's buying it, now that sales have collapsed, now they've had their big run, now they've poisoned billions of people, now... Oh, are they going to blame Trump in Australia?
[00:31:17.329 --> 00:31:18.189]  Or Trump in Germany?
[00:31:18.229 --> 00:31:19.050]  Or Trump in France?
[00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:19.510]  Or England?
[00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:19.750]  No.
[00:31:21.371 --> 00:31:24.113]  But domestically, they're going to try to blame him for this shot.
[00:31:25.714 --> 00:31:30.877]  But that will go worldwide and will save you more lives when it comes out that the shot was deadly poison.
[00:31:32.318 --> 00:31:32.738]  Incredible.
[00:31:33.843 --> 00:31:34.823]  So your calls are coming up.
[00:31:35.003 --> 00:31:39.445]  Jordan and Carlos and Tom and Wave and Julio and so many others.
[00:31:39.465 --> 00:31:46.527]  You know, a lot of times I just say first-time callers only because we got some great callers that are so quick to dial in that they just get in first and that's okay.
[00:31:46.547 --> 00:31:51.789]  But after these calls, only first-time callers again because I want to give new callers a chance.
[00:31:51.889 --> 00:31:56.410]  And I love these callers too, but you know, we got a computerized phone system.
[00:31:56.430 --> 00:31:57.691]  We can see the amount of calls we get.
[00:31:58.211 --> 00:32:00.112]  When we open the phones up, we get an average of 10,000 calls.
[00:32:02.202 --> 00:32:04.963]  One time we had over 30,000 calls in just two hours.
[00:32:06.123 --> 00:32:07.824]  That's how many great listeners we got trying to call in.
[00:32:07.864 --> 00:32:08.284]  We love you.
[00:32:09.264 --> 00:32:15.167]  But I don't know then how, when I don't say first-time callers only, how some of the same folks get in.
[00:32:15.187 --> 00:32:15.787]  But they're smart.
[00:32:16.087 --> 00:32:16.467]  We love them.
[00:32:16.487 --> 00:32:17.307]  We want to hear from Carlos.
[00:32:17.327 --> 00:32:18.768]  We want to hear from Julio.
[00:32:18.928 --> 00:32:22.209]  We want to hear from a lot of the folks that are there.
[00:32:22.249 --> 00:32:29.692]  But after these callers, first-time callers for all the new calls coming in, I want to give new callers a chance to get on board.
[00:32:30.672 --> 00:32:30.852]  Look.
[00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:34.870]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:32:35.611 --> 00:32:38.691]  I'm going to go ahead and just make the announcement now and make it official.
[00:32:40.152 --> 00:32:46.614]  Friday will be the last day you can get a signed copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[00:32:47.394 --> 00:32:50.275]  A, because we're about to sell out of the first group of books we got shipped.
[00:32:50.795 --> 00:32:51.875]  They start shipping next week.
[00:32:52.915 --> 00:32:57.354]   And B, I'm going to sign these and I can't sign Many more books.
[00:32:57.894 --> 00:33:00.096]  I mean, I'm up here hours a day signing these things.
[00:33:00.717 --> 00:33:05.380]  I'm trying to sign a thousand a day so that when they start shipping next week, they all go out to you.
[00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:10.145]  Even though it's a great fundraiser, I want to thank you for paying the big markup for the signed book as a fundraiser.
[00:33:11.138 --> 00:33:13.140]  You can get an unsigned one at Amazon or wherever you want.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:19.168]  Right now, we're only selling signed books at M4Shore.com, but I'm going to have to pull the plug on this at least for a month or so.
[00:33:19.208 --> 00:33:20.489]  But thank you for your support.
[00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.111]  Thank you for the fundraiser.
[00:33:22.532 --> 00:33:27.678]  Wow, we could fund the whole operation just with book sales if we could continue it, if I could sign them all.
[00:33:27.698 --> 00:33:29.860]  But I just can't do it, so your last chance.
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:32.340]  to get the great reset and War for the World signed books.
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.840]   Also, it's your last chance to get Vitamin Mineral Fusion 40% off,
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.340]  bodies discounted.
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.340]   Those are very close to selling out, so they're about to go back to full price.
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:41.840]  X2 is going back to full price.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.340]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA253-3139.
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:47.840]  But thank you for keeping us on the air.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.340]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:53.340]   All right, we're back live, about to take your phone calls at 877-833-4222.
[00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:57.192]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:57.212 --> 00:33:59.693]  Again, thank you so much for being part of this transmission.
[00:34:00.053 --> 00:34:01.974]  Let's look at some of these headlines that I was mentioning.
[00:34:01.994 --> 00:34:03.075]  We'll go right to your phone calls.
[00:34:04.256 --> 00:34:05.736]  The Democrats have set Trump up.
[00:34:05.776 --> 00:34:06.997]  The deep state set Trump up.
[00:34:07.237 --> 00:34:08.538]  They knew the shot was going to kill people.
[00:34:08.618 --> 00:34:09.618]  Eraser immune systems.
[00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:12.120]  They attacked as many of us as they could with the weapon.
[00:34:13.695 --> 00:34:17.057]  But it was globally coordinated, the exact same rollout of the exact same shots.
[00:34:17.698 --> 00:34:23.082]  Trump White House exerted pressure on FDA for COVID-19 emergency authorizations, House report finds.
[00:34:23.102 --> 00:34:24.062]  Well, yeah, he did it publicly.
[00:34:26.824 --> 00:34:34.910]  He went over all the examples of the Democrats coming out and saying, oh, don't take the shot, then suddenly saying, no, you should take it, in fact, you should be made to take it.
[00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:40.134]  New COVID vaccine study reveals increased risk in heart problems and neurological disorders after each dose.
[00:34:42.267 --> 00:34:46.730]  Rand Paul warns National Institutes of Health not to try and destroy evidence as Fauci exits.
[00:34:48.252 --> 00:34:49.433]  They know the investigations are coming.
[00:34:49.733 --> 00:34:55.978]  Former head of Planned Parenthood, CNN media analyst, who fiercely advocated masking, now admits it harmed her son's development.
[00:34:58.179 --> 00:35:02.283]  McEnroe says it's a joke that Djokovic won't be allowed to compete in the U.S.
[00:35:02.363 --> 00:35:02.583]  Open.
[00:35:02.803 --> 00:35:05.125]  This is still going on, the forced inoculations, folks.
[00:35:07.747 --> 00:35:10.389]  CNN tells viewers monkeypox is not sexually transmitted.
[00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:16.451]  Federal judge protects the religious rights of Marines who refuse COVID vaccine.
[00:35:16.772 --> 00:35:17.392]  A big victory.
[00:35:17.712 --> 00:35:19.033]  Also on InfoWars.com.
[00:35:20.994 --> 00:35:21.734]  Washington Post.
[00:35:21.814 --> 00:35:22.194]  Opinion.
[00:35:22.314 --> 00:35:22.935]  I'm a doctor.
[00:35:23.195 --> 00:35:25.356]  Here's why my kids won't wear masks this school year.
[00:35:25.596 --> 00:35:29.098]  So they abuse us, then they turn around as the heroes who are all against it.
[00:35:29.358 --> 00:35:35.541]  Though, when we were telling you two and a half years ago, two years ago, a year ago, six months ago, we were the devil.
[00:35:36.141 --> 00:35:38.082]  We were the worst people on earth for telling you.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.480]  Next year's news today.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:41.621]  Thank you for backing us.
[00:35:41.661 --> 00:35:42.641]  Thank you for standing with us.
[00:35:42.681 --> 00:35:43.781]  That's why they want to shut down.
[00:35:43.821 --> 00:35:48.203]  Because we're good, and we care about ourselves, and that means we care about everybody.
[00:35:48.623 --> 00:35:50.083]  Because it's all symbiotic.
[00:35:51.443 --> 00:35:54.264]  The big lie of evil is you can screw people over and not have it come back on you.
[00:35:54.464 --> 00:35:55.145]  That's a fraud.
[00:35:57.485 --> 00:35:57.785]  Alright.
[00:35:59.526 --> 00:36:00.526]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[00:36:01.226 --> 00:36:04.447]  And the order that the calls have been received.
[00:36:04.907 --> 00:36:06.908]  Jordan in New Jersey, thanks for calling.
[00:36:08.463 --> 00:36:11.465]  Hi Alex, I'm sorry about the first time caller thing.
[00:36:11.745 --> 00:36:13.266]  I didn't, I heard a free-for-all.
[00:36:13.586 --> 00:36:14.907]  Oh no, I said free-for-all.
[00:36:14.927 --> 00:36:15.667]  It's okay.
[00:36:16.288 --> 00:36:16.628]  It's okay.
[00:36:16.668 --> 00:36:17.208]  I apologize.
[00:36:17.348 --> 00:36:18.589]  No, no, it's my fault.
[00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:19.530]  I said free-for-all.
[00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:22.011]  Then I saw, I thought I saw some long-time callers.
[00:36:22.051 --> 00:36:23.892]  Actually it wasn't long-time callers calling in.
[00:36:23.912 --> 00:36:24.913]  So I said let's just do first time.
[00:36:25.173 --> 00:36:26.454]  Let's just, let's just get to your point.
[00:36:26.474 --> 00:36:26.714]  Go ahead.
[00:36:27.535 --> 00:36:38.383]  Okay, so I just want to say this whole thing about the responsibility of where all this comes from as far as the whole release, right, and then the inoculation program, and I just want to make this theme known.
[00:36:39.143 --> 00:36:49.251]  The National, you know, Defense Reauthorization Act, all right, starting after, you know, the 9-11 fiasco and, you know, farce.
[00:36:49.871 --> 00:36:55.275]  That's right, they've been preparing this whole biomedical forced inoculation tyranny for decades.
[00:36:56.337 --> 00:37:02.888]  Yes, and this is how they get all the Republicans to go along with all this crap too, without them having any sort of problem, right?
[00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:06.754]  Is they have them agree to these NDAAs.
[00:37:07.498 --> 00:37:13.762]  Um, and and and each one because you can see in each step, um, them getting human experimentation.
[00:37:13.822 --> 00:37:14.203]  That's right.
[00:37:14.223 --> 00:37:21.708]  Whether it's Brazil or Germany or the US, they had the government sign nondisclosure acts and indemnify Big Pharma when they rolled this out.
[00:37:21.968 --> 00:37:32.315]  And Big Pharma had financed and put all the major regulators in charge and the boards, not just of our government, but other governments who then advise the president and presidents to go along with the scam.
[00:37:32.555 --> 00:37:37.198]  That's what you call capture of governments or penetration of governments that Klaus Schwab talks about.
[00:37:38.539 --> 00:37:38.959]  Correct.
[00:37:39.259 --> 00:37:44.663]  And the military-industrial complex is all part of this big, giant cabal that is trying to consolidate their power.
[00:37:44.763 --> 00:37:48.705]  And 9-11 is a key event, which makes you this fulcrum, as you've discussed.
[00:37:49.366 --> 00:37:57.511]  Starting there, picking up people like me in 2003, and slowly building this Info Army to where now you are fighting the ultimate battle, Alex.
[00:37:57.951 --> 00:38:01.674]  And you are now vested with all the power of all that information.
[00:38:02.399 --> 00:38:09.084]  Um, and all that knowledge that you put into Great Reset that we now need to do the Tower of Grayskull.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:09.760]  Right?
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.802]  And become what we need to be in order to fight the next part of this.
[00:38:14.022 --> 00:38:21.806]  And that's why I just... The NDAA is where they built all the... The National Defense Authorization Act, you're absolutely right.
[00:38:22.226 --> 00:38:28.489]  And they had the Model States Health Emergency Powers Act that George W. Bush rammed through for forced inoculations as well.
[00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:37.334]  In fact, it's the exact same plan going back to his second administration for the masking, the six feet of separation, all that was in that document.
[00:38:38.368 --> 00:38:41.529]  Yes, and we're still questioning as to what to do.
[00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:48.510]  People need to go back and look at all those authorizations and find out where there might be more steps that might be taken by these psychopaths.
[00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:49.650]  Because that's the blueprint.
[00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:50.110]  Exactly.
[00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:56.032]  Guys, type in Model State Health Emergency Powers Act 2005.
[00:38:56.712 --> 00:38:57.152]  Look that up.
[00:38:58.272 --> 00:38:58.832]  All right, sir.
[00:38:58.892 --> 00:38:59.352]  Great points.
[00:38:59.412 --> 00:39:00.013]  Amazing call.
[00:39:00.033 --> 00:39:00.673]  Thank you, Jordan.
[00:39:01.333 --> 00:39:03.113]  And we are taking long-time callers, first-time callers.
[00:39:03.133 --> 00:39:04.854]  That was just me going down a rabbit trail.
[00:39:05.534 --> 00:39:09.224]   Let's talk to Tom in Tennessee.
[00:39:09.244 --> 00:39:09.744]  You're on the air.
[00:39:09.764 --> 00:39:10.244]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:39:11.905 --> 00:39:12.746]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[00:39:12.766 --> 00:39:13.567]  Hope you're doing good, brother.
[00:39:14.307 --> 00:39:17.989]  I just wanted to say that I think it was kind of a double-edged sword for Trump.
[00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:26.535]  If he wouldn't have come up with a vaccine, you know, push that, he'd have been blamed for, you know, every death that happened because of COVID.
[00:39:26.575 --> 00:39:34.740]  But since, you know, obviously since he did come up with one, you know, they're blaming him for the repercussions of it.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:47.160]   But as far as moving forward, you know, I think Trump's kind of becoming like a toxic ex that, you know, obviously there's still feelings, but it might just be time to move forward.
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.883]  You know, move on from it.
[00:39:51.121 --> 00:40:00.667]  No, I agree, but they're going to try to, whether we love Trump or hate Trump, they're going to try to parlay everything into him as the sacrificial lamb and blame him, thus blaming us.
[00:40:01.307 --> 00:40:05.650]  And I don't see that dog hunting, especially if Trump can extricate himself from this.
[00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:09.712]  That's why I've issued emergency message after emergency message to the president.
[00:40:11.313 --> 00:40:12.454]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:40:12.494 --> 00:40:14.295]  But I mean, there's a point though.
[00:40:14.315 --> 00:40:26.005]   I mean, you know, he's not, he's not really backing down and taking responsibility for You know what he has done or at least shifting that responsibility a little bit to some of the officials that he took that advice from.
[00:40:26.065 --> 00:40:32.591]  I think, you know, as far as as far as uniting and moving the country in the right direction.
[00:40:32.671 --> 00:40:38.597]  I mean, if he's not going to deny it and shift responsibility, I think, you know, we're losing hope.
[00:40:39.764 --> 00:40:40.204]  I hear you.
[00:40:40.384 --> 00:40:45.705]  And DeSantis is smart enough to get himself away from it, which is, again, not about protecting DeSantis.
[00:40:46.085 --> 00:40:47.806]  That'll make the whole thing fall apart.
[00:40:48.066 --> 00:40:51.346]  Then they can't inject six-month-old babies with it.
[00:40:51.646 --> 00:40:55.727]  That's why I'm going after Trump using DeSantis, knowing he's jealous of DeSantis.
[00:40:56.107 --> 00:40:59.408]  So if we start empowering DeSantis as doing the right thing, Trump might do the right thing.
[00:40:59.648 --> 00:41:00.808]  And I explained that last week.
[00:41:00.948 --> 00:41:04.389]  I'm just simply trying to get Trump to come out against it to save children.
[00:41:04.429 --> 00:41:05.109]  God bless you, brother.
[00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:05.789]  I appreciate your call.
[00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:08.250]  Let's go to Jason in Texas.
[00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.731]  Who is to blame for this?
[00:41:10.091 --> 00:41:10.691]  Is it Trump?
[00:41:10.771 --> 00:41:11.491]  Is it Bill Gates?
[00:41:11.871 --> 00:41:13.631]  Because, you know, somebody's going to pay for this.
[00:41:13.651 --> 00:41:17.532]  Well, of course it's Bill Gates and Fauci and all them.
[00:41:17.552 --> 00:41:20.233]  Why do you think they're getting boosted and he's trying to flee?
[00:41:20.993 --> 00:41:24.154]  Like Dr. Ron Paul said, you ain't going nowhere.
[00:41:24.394 --> 00:41:26.614]  You know, we've been saying this from day one.
[00:41:26.934 --> 00:41:29.275]  And I'll tell you what, right now, here's their plan.
[00:41:29.975 --> 00:41:34.936]  They are going to release a bomb or something on the U.S.
[00:41:36.155 --> 00:41:37.876]  They're going to nullify this election.
[00:41:38.476 --> 00:41:39.557]  They know they're finished.
[00:41:40.377 --> 00:41:48.302]  So, you're going to sit down with, you know, and then they're going to take over.
[00:41:48.322 --> 00:41:50.563]  There won't even be an election.
[00:41:50.923 --> 00:41:56.686]  And then on, uh, if you look in like certain cities, I got a realtor.
[00:41:57.266 --> 00:42:09.397]   My buddy's dad is a realtor and they kind of have the inside scoop on what's going to be what and There's multiple big warehouses being built all over and nobody knows what they're for.
[00:42:09.417 --> 00:42:18.505]  So when they turn the lights out and there's no heat or, you know, in the winter, you know, in the summer for cool, I'll come to this place, you know, warm up.
[00:42:18.905 --> 00:42:20.947]  No, that's, that's the death camp.
[00:42:21.263 --> 00:42:21.723]  No, you're right.
[00:42:21.743 --> 00:42:24.644]  They're already creating warming centers and heating centers around the world.
[00:42:24.684 --> 00:42:27.925]  In fact, I was about to say this when you talked about cutting the power.
[00:42:27.945 --> 00:42:29.806]  Tsunami of shutoffs.
[00:42:30.566 --> 00:42:31.226]  20 million U.S.
[00:42:31.246 --> 00:42:32.747]  homes are behind on power bills.
[00:42:33.187 --> 00:42:34.027]  Same thing in Europe.
[00:42:34.087 --> 00:42:37.208]  This is the designed collapse of civilization, brother.
[00:42:37.808 --> 00:42:39.069]  Thank you so much, Jason.
[00:42:39.089 --> 00:42:40.189]  I appreciate your call.
[00:42:40.289 --> 00:42:40.609]  Wow.
[00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:43.450]  All right.
[00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:46.011]  We got Julio's up next and so much more.
[00:42:46.491 --> 00:42:49.292]  We got Drew Hernandez popping in to give his view on this.
[00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:52.571]  Believe it, this is the big issue.
[00:42:54.333 --> 00:42:57.055]  Because the New World Order is going down, when it comes out they brought this shot out.
[00:42:57.615 --> 00:42:59.317]  So they think globally they're going to blame Trump.
[00:43:01.238 --> 00:43:06.783]  When it was the British intelligence and the New World Order and our own Defense Department, they launched all this.
[00:43:06.823 --> 00:43:08.344]  People say, oh the military will save us.
[00:43:08.384 --> 00:43:09.685]  Our military is full of good men and women.
[00:43:10.426 --> 00:43:13.208]  But at the top, they are New World Order.
[00:43:14.169 --> 00:43:15.390]  And they think we're stupid.
[00:43:16.751 --> 00:43:31.045]   And so ahead of the collapse, they've soft killed as many people as they can, Ahead of the economic total shutdown and the cyber attacks they're going to blame on the Russians.
[00:43:31.125 --> 00:43:32.205]  I mean, you can just see it.
[00:43:32.865 --> 00:43:33.525]  You can taste it.
[00:43:33.565 --> 00:43:34.186]  You can smell it.
[00:43:34.226 --> 00:43:35.406]  This is devastating.
[00:43:36.046 --> 00:43:39.167]  That's why it's more important now than ever.
[00:43:39.307 --> 00:43:43.749]  It's a symbiotic relationship to warn everybody because that could mitigate this.
[00:43:43.789 --> 00:43:44.769]  That could back them down.
[00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:46.190]  Their plan's not going well.
[00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:49.131]  Maybe there's some smart people in the system that are going to put the brakes on this.
[00:43:49.551 --> 00:43:50.732]  I mean, thank God it's coming out.
[00:43:50.772 --> 00:43:51.572]  The shots killed people.
[00:43:53.226 --> 00:43:55.787]  If folks hadn't woken up to it, they'd have just kept riding that horse forever.
[00:43:56.227 --> 00:43:59.307]  But their double-back plan was to blame Trump if it came out what they were doing.
[00:44:00.187 --> 00:44:01.328]  So they're all running over the hills.
[00:44:01.368 --> 00:44:05.468]  They're all engaged in, you know, fleeing the sinking ship.
[00:44:06.509 --> 00:44:09.169]  This is the big debate we're having, the big discussion we're having.
[00:44:09.669 --> 00:44:14.490]  Whatever you do, tell folks about the live feeds at InfoWars.com forward slash show and band dot video.
[00:44:14.810 --> 00:44:16.130]  And remember, we're listener-funded.
[00:44:16.751 --> 00:44:17.951]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:44:17.971 --> 00:44:18.551]  We'll be right back.
[00:44:20.376 --> 00:44:22.997]  Take a journey to the bright midnight.
[00:44:27.198 --> 00:44:29.458]  Alright, Wave in Tennessee, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:44:32.979 --> 00:44:33.400]  Hey Alex.
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.060]  Yes sir?
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.900]  Man, I'm just sick of these freaking reptilians and this government!
[00:44:37.081 --> 00:44:39.261]  I'm so sick of them trying to control our lives!
[00:44:39.541 --> 00:44:44.903]  So sick of them poisoning us with these jets and these chemtrails and these... Sick of it!
[00:44:45.463 --> 00:44:46.183]  So sick of it!
[00:44:46.952 --> 00:44:51.074]  I just pray to God for a hedge of protection over all of us every day!
[00:44:51.094 --> 00:44:54.336]  I hear you, brother.
[00:44:54.376 --> 00:45:03.900]  Yeah, I just want to say, Alex, I remember you saying that Trump's son had been vaccinated and he got some sort of autism from it.
[00:45:04.261 --> 00:45:06.081]  What the heck is going on with Trump?
[00:45:06.322 --> 00:45:07.242]  What is he doing?
[00:45:07.402 --> 00:45:08.302]  He's blackmailed.
[00:45:08.383 --> 00:45:09.623]  What is going on, brother?
[00:45:10.243 --> 00:45:11.444]  Whatever it is, it ain't good.
[00:45:11.924 --> 00:45:12.445]  Thank you, sir.
[00:45:13.265 --> 00:45:14.966]  Julio in Colorado, you're on the air.
[00:45:15.006 --> 00:45:15.306]  Welcome.
[00:45:16.963 --> 00:45:19.246]  Well, it's great to chat with you, Alejandro.
[00:45:19.386 --> 00:45:24.311]  Patient zero before they carve your corpse up, as I heard on the commercial.
[00:45:25.192 --> 00:45:29.978]  Look, Colorado, Denver, Colorado, reminds me a lot of the great Hank Williams Jr.
[00:45:30.018 --> 00:45:31.699]  song, OD'd in Denver.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:46.278]   I call it Mount Skid Row because I hate to say it, but this city is deteriorating faster and faster, and that's going to be most of the country as energy bills skyrocket as we hit into winter.
[00:45:46.539 --> 00:46:08.883]   Now, Alejandro, I don't know who Senor Donald Trump is listening to, who his advisers are, but he needs to either change advisers or listen more of his gut instincts because, as you just mentioned, We're going to see more and more articles as more and more people get sick, as more myocarditis gets diagnosed.
[00:46:10.203 --> 00:46:11.923]  This is going to get blamed on Trump now.
[00:46:11.963 --> 00:46:18.124]  He has this golden opportunity to turn around and say, hey, look, Fauci lied to me, Birx lied to me.
[00:46:18.164 --> 00:46:21.945]  I mean, they're all coming out and admitting that they lied to the president.
[00:46:23.946 --> 00:46:36.837]   Whoever the president is listening to, he must change course immediately because it doesn't, I mean, yes, Across the country and across the states, MAGA-type candidates are winning these types of elections.
[00:46:36.857 --> 00:46:38.918]  They're winning school board seats, etc., etc.
[00:46:39.699 --> 00:46:49.724]  But it's quite clear, Alejandro, that Donald Trump's going to get set up here in the coming months as the elite system is falling completely in their favor.
[00:46:49.744 --> 00:46:50.705]  Oh, absolutely, Leo.
[00:46:50.725 --> 00:46:51.265]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:51.305 --> 00:46:52.326]  It's already begun.
[00:46:52.426 --> 00:46:53.767]  DJ in New York, go ahead.
[00:46:55.668 --> 00:46:57.248]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[00:46:58.089 --> 00:47:23.476]   I just wanted to share with the audience For my many years of looking at this stuff, going back to the 80s before you were on air, I just keep looking at all the different players of the cabal, and I can't help but to see the one of all of them that sits closest up to the capstone, and that's the Jesuits.
[00:47:23.617 --> 00:47:24.957]  They're really the they.
[00:47:25.217 --> 00:47:28.798]  They're the ones who are the progenitors of all this evil.
[00:47:28.818 --> 00:47:30.159]  Fauci is one of them.
[00:47:30.656 --> 00:47:33.936]  Many of the others that we know are part of them.
[00:47:33.936 --> 00:47:37.696]  Well, the Pope is totally in the wrong order.
[00:47:37.696 --> 00:47:43.296]   The Pope is taking over. The Catholic Church is subservient to the Jesuits and the Knights of the Balta.
[00:47:43.296 --> 00:47:47.296]  And they have their inroads going way back with the Chinese.
[00:47:47.359 --> 00:47:50.281]  That's why the Catholic Church is the only official church there.
[00:47:50.321 --> 00:47:53.583]  Now for those who don't know, the Portuguese discovered China and made the first deal.
[00:47:53.623 --> 00:48:01.788]  So, I mean, definitely the old, more powerful than the British Empire has been the, not the Catholic people, but the Jesuits in control of the rudders.
[00:48:02.568 --> 00:48:04.449]  And that was the secret maps into the Orient.
[00:48:05.590 --> 00:48:09.372]  You can't become a head of state without them approving or allowing it.
[00:48:09.932 --> 00:48:12.454]  They control the secret societies of the world.
[00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:15.592]  They control the monetary systems.
[00:48:15.732 --> 00:48:20.536]  They are the ones in the driver's seat in the pilot's nest.
[00:48:20.836 --> 00:48:22.417]  They're in control.
[00:48:22.878 --> 00:48:28.242]  They're the ones that are the pedophiles, that are the child traffickers, the abusers.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:35.743]  They are the ones that people in the audience need to really research to discover who their real enemy is when they say they.
[00:48:36.063 --> 00:48:43.347]  Well, there's no doubt that the Jesuit Order has taken over the Catholic Church and used pedophilia to do it, and there's no doubt it's one of the most ancient, powerful groups there is.
[00:48:43.907 --> 00:48:49.070]  But they conflate that between Catholics and that, and I think Catholics are great people, but I hear what you're saying, brother.
[00:48:49.350 --> 00:48:49.910]  Thank you, DJ.
[00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.491]  All right, we're going to come back.
[00:48:52.371 --> 00:48:56.371]   But Drew Hernandez for two segments and I'm right back to your phone calls here today
[00:48:56.371 --> 00:49:04.351]   877-789-ALEX-877-789-2539 Drew is upset about what's happening with Trump as well. I'm
[00:49:04.351 --> 00:49:13.811]   gonna get his take The cavalry

[00:49:19.811 --> 00:49:26.891]   wars on the air with funding has now arrived a 360 win almost sold out for a year
[00:49:26.891 --> 00:49:33.251]   DNA force plus with the PQQ and the Co Q10 and all the patented documented
[00:49:33.251 --> 00:49:34.070]  Mmm.
[00:49:34.759 --> 00:49:41.743]  Super ingredients to completely turbocharge your immune system and your body is finally back in stock.
[00:49:42.383 --> 00:49:50.588]  And despite the fact it's going to sell out quick, I want those of you that haven't experienced it to get it, and I want long-term supporters to experience it as well.
[00:49:50.888 --> 00:49:54.611]  So it is 50% off out of the gates for a limited time.
[00:49:55.051 --> 00:50:00.514]  DNA Force Plus, finally back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com for 50% off.
[00:50:02.395 --> 00:50:05.297]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a symbiotic relationship.
[00:50:06.198 --> 00:50:10.481]  Supporting InfoWars defeats the globalists, and this product does amazing things for your body.
[00:50:10.581 --> 00:50:11.322]  Take action now.
[00:50:12.283 --> 00:50:17.507]  InfoWars founder Alex Jones is calling out alleged collusion between Google and Democrats.
[00:50:17.807 --> 00:50:22.791]  The American people demand that their First Amendment be defended!
[00:50:22.851 --> 00:50:24.592]  The Republic is rising!
[00:50:24.612 --> 00:50:28.555]  Well, Alex, you're the gladiator, and you keep on pounding the opposition.
[00:50:28.655 --> 00:50:29.116]  I love it.
[00:50:29.256 --> 00:50:30.437]  Alex Jones, nice guy.
[00:50:30.457 --> 00:50:32.178]  You've been demonized enough?
[00:50:32.458 --> 00:50:36.581]  I mean, you must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:37.541]  Alex Jones.
[00:50:38.942 --> 00:50:39.323]  Alex Jones.
[00:50:40.824 --> 00:50:45.827]  I know we had Alex Jones in the room earlier promoting conspiracy theories.
[00:50:45.947 --> 00:50:50.090]  Alex Jones obviously is one of the conspiracy theorists whose brand is bullying.
[00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:51.831]  You didn't call me to testify in America.
[00:50:51.871 --> 00:50:53.711]  I have a right to face my accusers.
[00:50:53.791 --> 00:50:56.152]  And you, Congressman Deutch, are a liar and a fraud.
[00:50:56.192 --> 00:51:05.455]  The real election meddling is by Facebook and Google and others that are shadowbanning people, that are outright banning people, and they're blocking conservatives involved in their own First Amendment political speech.
[00:51:05.676 --> 00:51:08.577]  InfoWars tells viewers that the world is out to get them.
[00:51:08.597 --> 00:51:12.198]  The FCC is cracking down on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:51:12.538 --> 00:51:15.380]  InfoWars just lost their war on info.
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:22.985]  Yesterday, Apple, iTunes, Vimeo, and Spotify, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook have all blocked Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:51:23.005 --> 00:51:29.010]  So there's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can you ban this person?
[00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:30.210]  I want them shut down.
[00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:31.191]  I want them silenced.
[00:51:31.231 --> 00:51:32.012]  I want them muted.
[00:51:32.052 --> 00:51:33.873]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:51:34.053 --> 00:51:35.435]  I want some shutdown!
[00:51:35.535 --> 00:51:36.717]  I want some silence!
[00:51:36.877 --> 00:51:39.421]  Alex Jones has now been taken off Facebook, thank God.
[00:51:39.461 --> 00:51:42.505]  But who is the most banned news network in the world?
[00:51:42.806 --> 00:51:46.371]  InfoWars.com InfoWars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:51:47.299 --> 00:51:48.399]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[00:51:48.459 --> 00:51:49.699]  What's happened with InfoWars?
[00:51:49.719 --> 00:51:53.660]  I would love it if you would follow up also about Alex Jones and InfoWars.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.360]  InfoWars.
[00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.320]  You watch InfoWars?
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.761]  President Trump is the InfoWars president.
[00:51:58.861 --> 00:52:00.421]  Trump appeared on Jones' show.
[00:52:00.501 --> 00:52:05.222]  He actually went on Jones' show and said, Your reputation's amazing.
[00:52:05.642 --> 00:52:07.362]  I will not let you down.
[00:52:07.523 --> 00:52:08.443]  Move, bitch!
[00:52:08.523 --> 00:52:10.283]  Get out the way!
[00:52:10.403 --> 00:52:11.283]  Hop, hop, and away!
[00:52:11.343 --> 00:52:13.224]  Fall as well.
[00:52:13.404 --> 00:52:15.464]  Why do you hate the First Amendment so much?
[00:52:16.084 --> 00:52:17.066]  There goes an armistice law as well.
[00:52:17.086 --> 00:52:18.267]  Google is going to log in and violate the law?
[00:52:18.287 --> 00:52:18.608]  That's enough.
[00:52:18.628 --> 00:52:19.269]  You're making too much noise.
[00:52:19.289 --> 00:52:20.211]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:52:20.031 --> 00:52:22.031]  and violate the law?
[00:52:22.031 --> 00:52:24.031]  That's enough, you're making too much noise.
[00:52:24.031 --> 00:52:25.031]  That man's a threat to this country.
[00:52:25.031 --> 00:52:26.031]  I'd like to reserve time.
[00:52:26.031 --> 00:52:27.031]  No.
[00:52:27.031 --> 00:52:28.031]  I'm going to be willing to have a fight.
[00:52:28.031 --> 00:52:30.031]  One week at this point.
[00:52:30.031 --> 00:52:32.031]  I'm getting pissed now.
[00:52:32.079 --> 00:52:33.840]  And the defibrillator didn't work.
[00:52:34.661 --> 00:52:36.883]  With me, it's all straightforward attack.
[00:52:36.943 --> 00:52:38.244]  That's the real power!
[00:52:38.324 --> 00:52:42.708]  Hello, this is Hank Hill, and I'm telling you what, you need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:52:43.449 --> 00:52:45.771]  And for worse, not worse.
[00:52:45.791 --> 00:52:46.712]  1776 will commence again.
[00:52:48.433 --> 00:52:58.536]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead attack-dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press working with big tech.
[00:52:58.436 --> 00:53:02.936]   We're not turning our guns in, and we're not running, and we're not backing down.
[00:53:02.936 --> 00:53:05.436]  If you want 'em, come and take 'em!
[00:53:05.436 --> 00:53:10.436]  [cheering]
[00:53:10.936 --> 00:53:16.436]   So, the House of Representatives, run by Democrats, has put out a report blaming Trump for any vaccine damage,
[00:53:16.436 --> 00:53:19.436]  saying he made them put out the experimental shot.
[00:53:19.625 --> 00:53:22.591]  We know it's Fauci and Bill Gates, the New World Order.
[00:53:24.557 --> 00:53:25.978]  Why does Trump not understand that?
[00:53:25.998 --> 00:53:27.599]  I was talking to Drew Hernandez this morning via text.
[00:53:27.639 --> 00:53:30.300]  He said, just like he predicted, it's now out there.
[00:53:30.661 --> 00:53:37.504]  Headlines, exclusive, vaccinated, making up higher proportion of COVID-19 metrics in the U.S., including hospitalizations and deaths.
[00:53:37.985 --> 00:53:38.945]  Same numbers worldwide.
[00:53:39.005 --> 00:53:40.526]  That's out of the epic times.
[00:53:41.967 --> 00:53:43.808]  It's a big deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:43.828 --> 00:53:46.289]  Drew Hernandez, thank you for joining us.
[00:53:46.329 --> 00:53:48.010]  I wanted to get your take on the situation.
[00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:48.971]  I think this is huge.
[00:53:49.591 --> 00:53:51.332]  This shows the rats are leaving the sinking ship.
[00:53:51.392 --> 00:53:54.054]  And if Trump doesn't get ahead of this, this is going to bring him down.
[00:53:55.604 --> 00:53:58.166]  Absolutely, Alex, and you know, thanks for having me.
[00:53:58.226 --> 00:54:00.708]  Shout out to the N4 Warriors in the Getter Chat.
[00:54:00.728 --> 00:54:03.269]  They want you to know that they love you very much, Alex.
[00:54:03.309 --> 00:54:06.892]  But I wanted to analyze this Politico article with you.
[00:54:06.932 --> 00:54:08.193]  Just take a look at the headline.
[00:54:08.213 --> 00:54:09.694]  Look at how they word this, okay?
[00:54:10.034 --> 00:54:16.699]  The Trump administration pressured the FDA to authorize unproven treatments.
[00:54:17.581 --> 00:54:27.149]  Unproven treatments for COVID-19 and the first COVID-19 vaccines on an accelerated timeline.
[00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:28.811]  Operation Warp Speed.
[00:54:29.171 --> 00:54:30.492]  Okay, people need to understand.
[00:54:30.952 --> 00:54:38.599]  You are literally watching propaganda begin to get fed to the public for a future narrative to be installed on President Trump.
[00:54:38.639 --> 00:54:38.959]  That's right.
[00:54:39.079 --> 00:54:40.060]  This is the kickoff.
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:40.901]  This is the kickoff.
[00:54:41.761 --> 00:54:43.181]  This is literally the kickoff.
[00:54:43.221 --> 00:54:51.843]  They use this verbiage because listen, people have been banned for this stuff on Facebook and Twitter for posting these exact same things, saying Trump's being set up.
[00:54:52.464 --> 00:54:54.364]  Trump's being set up with Operation Warp Speed.
[00:54:54.584 --> 00:54:55.664]  It's a bad vaccine.
[00:54:56.285 --> 00:55:02.406]  It's not good for the people and it's being put, people have been banned for this kind of stuff, but we know what these people do, Alex.
[00:55:02.446 --> 00:55:03.726]  So they are kicking this off.
[00:55:04.086 --> 00:55:06.467]  There's been a shift in the simulation.
[00:55:06.907 --> 00:55:08.588]  And this is meant to mess with your mind.
[00:55:08.608 --> 00:55:10.208]  This is how the info war works.
[00:55:10.488 --> 00:55:11.969]  This is how propaganda works.
[00:55:12.249 --> 00:55:17.510]  They are literally setting up the narrative for whoever is going to run in 2022 in the midterms already.
[00:55:17.550 --> 00:55:20.851]  They're giving them more ammo to go against Trump candidates.
[00:55:21.111 --> 00:55:24.812]  And ultimately, they're giving more ammo to whoever runs against Trump in 2024.
[00:55:24.973 --> 00:55:25.093]  Okay.
[00:55:26.793 --> 00:55:36.245]  Now, I say this because I love the Republic and I love where our country was going in 2016 to 2019, and I want to see that continue.
[00:55:36.606 --> 00:55:41.612]  Now, when I say this about President Trump, I say this because I want him to just clearly understand.
[00:55:42.012 --> 00:55:56.423]  I mean these people are literally setting you up to literally be the sacrificial lamb to blame millions of deaths and blame the vaccine negative effects that are happening to people not only mentally but physically literally on you.
[00:55:56.684 --> 00:55:59.766]  Take a look at how the narrative is being set up and Alex you know this.
[00:56:00.286 --> 00:56:03.489]  Why is Dr. Fauci riding off into the sunset in December?
[00:56:03.869 --> 00:56:04.770]  Is it because he's scared?
[00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:07.610]   scared that there's going to be investigations and he's going to be,
[00:56:07.610 --> 00:56:08.449]  you know, exposed.
[00:56:08.449 --> 00:56:12.570]   That's not why it's because they're setting up Trump to be the bit to be the
[00:56:12.570 --> 00:56:13.409]  blame right now.
[00:56:13.409 --> 00:56:16.809]   He's right off into the sunset because they're setting up Trump to blame for
[00:56:16.809 --> 00:56:17.970]  these bad vaccines.
[00:56:17.970 --> 00:56:18.890]  That's why Dr.
[00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:22.490]   Fauci is in the news literally today saying I have nothing to hide.
[00:56:22.490 --> 00:56:24.050]  That's a quote.
[00:56:25.014 --> 00:56:26.375]  Why is he saying that, Alex?
[00:56:26.675 --> 00:56:29.897]  Because they know that they're going to blame all this on Trump.
[00:56:29.997 --> 00:56:32.719]  Oh, well, I was just advising the current president.
[00:56:32.839 --> 00:56:33.740]  And it's not just him.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.901]  It's the head of the CDC.
[00:56:35.021 --> 00:56:35.581]  It's Burks.
[00:56:35.982 --> 00:56:37.863]  They're all saying, we knew it didn't work.
[00:56:37.923 --> 00:56:38.523]  We lied.
[00:56:38.784 --> 00:56:40.725]  So later they're going to go, well, we told you years ago.
[00:56:41.265 --> 00:56:43.167]  They are literally pre-programming this right now.
[00:56:44.185 --> 00:56:44.665]  Exactly.
[00:56:44.705 --> 00:56:47.646]  That is exactly why the CDC is coming out saying the same thing.
[00:56:47.726 --> 00:56:50.227]  And Dr. Birx is coming out and saying the exact same thing.
[00:56:51.007 --> 00:56:54.229]  We knew all along that this wasn't effective.
[00:56:54.549 --> 00:56:56.770]  I mean, we were advising the president at the time.
[00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:58.710]  I mean, that's what we were doing.
[00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:02.472]  They are literally going to pin this on President Trump alone.
[00:57:02.972 --> 00:57:06.153]  And he needs to understand that this is part of the PSYOP.
[00:57:06.373 --> 00:57:07.013]  I totally agree.
[00:57:07.033 --> 00:57:08.093]  And here's the key, Drew, for me.
[00:57:08.114 --> 00:57:08.954]  I want your take on this.
[00:57:09.654 --> 00:57:13.640]  Whether you love Trump or neutral or hate him, I think overall he's a great guy, but I'm mad at him.
[00:57:14.161 --> 00:57:14.781]  It doesn't matter.
[00:57:14.801 --> 00:57:16.324]  We don't want him getting the blame.
[00:57:16.364 --> 00:57:17.986]  We want Fauci and Bill Gates to get it.
[00:57:18.987 --> 00:57:19.768]  That's the key here.
[00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:23.794]  We want the people that are responsible to get the blame.
[00:57:23.834 --> 00:57:24.916]  And I'll say this as well.
[00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:29.057]  President Trump and the people around him, don't wait too long.
[00:57:29.577 --> 00:57:31.978]  The longer you wait, the worse it looks.
[00:57:32.378 --> 00:57:34.639]  The longer you wait, the worse it looks.
[00:57:35.699 --> 00:57:46.024]  And this is part of the thing, this is where we got to be careful too, Alex, is part of this PSYOP, part of what they're doing to him is to get his own supporters that got him there to turn on him.
[00:57:45.923 --> 00:57:49.083]   him. That's why media matters and all these people are running hit pieces on
[00:57:49.083 --> 00:57:52.483]   you Alex to make it look like you literally hate Trump. But I know what
[00:57:52.483 --> 00:57:55.762]   you're doing you're trying to just get him to go against the global elites man
[00:57:55.762 --> 00:57:59.204]   like go against these people like where where are you man can the real Trump
[00:57:59.204 --> 00:58:02.364]   please stand up. Well exactly I've been I've been I've been tapping him on the
[00:58:02.364 --> 00:58:05.802]   shoulder I've been whispering in his ear and now I hit him in the head with a two
[00:58:05.802 --> 00:58:12.163]   by four politically to get his ass to wake up. And that's all we want.
[00:58:10.264 --> 00:58:14.246]  We want President Trump to just come out, be aggressive against these people.
[00:58:14.286 --> 00:58:15.566]  I mean, really think about it, right?
[00:58:15.586 --> 00:58:20.407]  For people that are still sitting on the fence, it's like, eh, I don't know, this is maybe a little too much for me.
[00:58:20.868 --> 00:58:22.368]  Listen, listen, listen.
[00:58:22.608 --> 00:58:25.529]  What have these people done in the past six years, okay?
[00:58:25.929 --> 00:58:34.272]  Impeached him multiple times, set up his supporters, okay, with multiple PSYOPs, to even use that to turn them against him.
[00:58:34.292 --> 00:58:44.514]   And now the FBI is being mobilized to go after not only his supporters, But President Trump and they deplatformed a sitting US president.
[00:58:45.319 --> 00:58:46.900]  Look how far this has gone.
[00:58:47.180 --> 00:58:49.202]  President Trump needs to wake up.
[00:58:49.622 --> 00:58:55.006]  Wake up right now and shift gears and get aggressive against these people and go on offense.
[00:58:55.266 --> 00:58:55.906]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:58:55.926 --> 00:58:56.587]  Let's talk more about it.
[00:58:56.607 --> 00:58:57.147]  You're on fire.
[00:58:57.227 --> 00:58:57.828]  Absolutely right.
[00:58:58.468 --> 00:59:01.230]  Because the crowning thing they're going to blame on him is the shot.
[00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:02.611]  But they did it worldwide.
[00:59:02.631 --> 00:59:04.552]  It was all coordinated by the UN and the WEF.
[00:59:04.973 --> 00:59:05.993]  They ran it.
[00:59:06.053 --> 00:59:06.794]  They get the blame.
[00:59:07.154 --> 00:59:08.235]  Not our populist movement.
[00:59:08.275 --> 00:59:09.336]  This is so critical.
[00:59:09.616 --> 00:59:10.937]  But Drew Hernandez straight ahead.
[00:59:11.197 --> 00:59:12.498]  This is tomorrow's news today.
[00:59:12.578 --> 00:59:13.539]  Stay with us.
[00:59:15.283 --> 00:59:20.648]  All right, Drew Hernandez, you are 100% on target, issuing your own emergency message to President Trump.
[00:59:20.708 --> 00:59:21.930]  Please continue, my friend.
[00:59:23.431 --> 00:59:25.513]  Well, Alex, listen, I just want to clear the air here.
[00:59:25.553 --> 00:59:32.544]   Listen, you know, This current administration are the ones that came out and they pushed the lockdowns.
[00:59:32.584 --> 00:59:36.566]  They used Operation Warp Speed and they imposed it on the American people.
[00:59:36.626 --> 00:59:41.730]  The heroes that were in the medical industry in 2020 became the villains in 2021.
[00:59:41.790 --> 00:59:45.492]  The airlines that were all protesting, people that lost their jobs.
[00:59:45.913 --> 00:59:50.496]  It was a horrible thing that happened in 2021, but the stage was set with Operation Warp Speed.
[00:59:50.516 --> 00:59:54.496]   And to Trump's credit, he did dish it down to the governors in 2020 to decide
[00:59:54.496 --> 00:59:58.394]   whether they're going to lock down their states, their cities or not.
[00:59:58.394 --> 00:59:58.934]  Right?
[00:59:58.934 --> 01:00:02.576]   So to Trump's credit, that's what truly took place according to history.
[01:00:02.576 --> 01:00:07.414]   But at the same time, this is my heart and I'm just being honest with the viewers
[01:00:07.414 --> 01:00:10.615]   and I'm being honest with you, Alex, and I think you feel the same way too.
[01:00:10.615 --> 01:00:12.836]  I don't want to destroy Trump.
[01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:15.083]  I want the country to succeed.
[01:00:15.103 --> 01:00:17.003]  I want Trump to succeed.
[01:00:17.023 --> 01:00:24.627]  I want our populist figures, including Alex Jones, myself and President Trump and whoever else, the Ron DeSantis's of the world.
[01:00:24.967 --> 01:00:27.928]  I want us to succeed because I want America to succeed.
[01:00:28.408 --> 01:00:41.878]  Everyone that's watching this just wants America to succeed, but we know that these entities out there, these global elites and the communists that have infiltrated all channels in society that have this agenda, they want this to be destroyed.
[01:00:41.918 --> 01:00:42.779]  It's the Great Reset.
[01:00:42.799 --> 01:00:43.519]  That's what it is.
[01:00:43.859 --> 01:00:52.464]   President Trump needs to come out aggressively against the Great Reset starting yesterday, starting two years years ago when it was all in motion.
[01:00:52.464 --> 01:00:55.464]   Right now, I'm telling you right now, this is my opinion, Alex.
[01:00:55.464 --> 01:00:58.584]   I don't know if people are going to agree with this, but this is what I see coming.
[01:00:58.584 --> 01:01:03.824]   President Trump, people are either going to view you as someone that's in on this
[01:01:03.824 --> 01:01:07.664]   or just too afraid to call out the global elite that you claimed you were
[01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.624]  willing to call out in 2016.
[01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:12.144]  That is going to cause you to lose some serious support.
[01:01:12.144 --> 01:01:13.223]  I don't want that.
[01:01:13.223 --> 01:01:14.543]  Alex doesn't want that.
[01:01:14.543 --> 01:01:18.584]   The American people that love this country and love you don't want that.
[01:01:18.759 --> 01:01:20.580]  But that's what they want, Alex.
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:22.721]  That's what these deep staters want.
[01:01:23.041 --> 01:01:24.681]  That's what the global cabal wants.
[01:01:24.962 --> 01:01:25.842]  It's the perfect side.
[01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:27.263]  How do we detach?
[01:01:27.503 --> 01:01:29.864]  That's always been the number one question, hasn't it been, Alex?
[01:01:29.884 --> 01:01:30.324]  How do we detach?
[01:01:32.965 --> 01:01:36.669]  President Trump from his loyal supporters, no matter what we've done.
[01:01:37.290 --> 01:01:42.255]  Hillary Clinton called everyone a basket of deplorables, attacked the voters, attacked the supporters.
[01:01:42.535 --> 01:01:46.520]  Let's just demonize them as white supremacists, even if they're brown or black.
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:48.522]  Let's just call them domestic terrorists.
[01:01:48.802 --> 01:01:53.227]  They've tried everything they possibly can to detach him from his supporters.
[01:01:53.567 --> 01:01:59.409]  This, I will tell you right now, is a very strategic way and an effective way to do that.
[01:01:59.709 --> 01:02:02.651]  Because people are seeing this for what it really is.
[01:02:02.831 --> 01:02:03.631]  It's the truth.
[01:02:03.931 --> 01:02:05.272]  And the facts don't lie.
[01:02:05.492 --> 01:02:06.832]  This has been a setup.
[01:02:07.032 --> 01:02:08.973]  This jab is literally hurting people.
[01:02:09.233 --> 01:02:11.674]  President Trump, we don't want to humiliate you.
[01:02:11.954 --> 01:02:15.015]  What I'm saying is, just come out and tell the truth.
[01:02:15.956 --> 01:02:16.716]  You just said it.
[01:02:16.976 --> 01:02:19.557]  So start what you said last segment and this segment, combine them.
[01:02:19.817 --> 01:02:21.538]  Because you said it better than I could.
[01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:24.040]  Trump didn't do forced inoculation.
[01:02:24.100 --> 01:02:25.261]  He didn't do forced masking.
[01:02:25.321 --> 01:02:29.285]  They grabbed the program they launched under him as soon as Biden got it.
[01:02:29.666 --> 01:02:30.406]  He accelerated it.
[01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:37.714]  Trump's just got to expose that, talk about that, say they're the ones, and then everybody will get behind him instead of letting them set him up.
[01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:38.355]  It's very simple.
[01:02:39.494 --> 01:02:41.094]  Alex, you know this, okay?
[01:02:41.415 --> 01:02:43.195]  You know how the info war works.
[01:02:43.695 --> 01:02:46.136]  You know how the media and propaganda works.
[01:02:46.576 --> 01:02:47.496]  It's a narrative war.
[01:02:47.856 --> 01:03:04.681]  If you let these people get way too far ahead of you in the narrative with their installed narrative, their installed propaganda, which is how we started this segment, Alex, taking a look at that political article, they're already using the verbiage to get the population ready to accept this was Trump's fault too.
[01:03:05.161 --> 01:03:09.961]   If President Trump waits too long, I fear it's going to going to be too late and even some of his supporters are
[01:03:09.961 --> 01:03:14.121]   going to start to see this and it's a genuine thing to take a look at and hold him
[01:03:14.121 --> 01:03:18.661]   accountable to and they're going to start to pull back their support and go to people like
[01:03:18.661 --> 01:03:20.882]   DeSantis because people like him...
[01:03:20.882 --> 01:03:23.441]  Let me say this because it's key.
[01:03:23.441 --> 01:03:25.961]  Trump thinks, okay I may have screwed up.
[01:03:25.952 --> 01:03:27.013]  I'll just hope it goes away.
[01:03:27.033 --> 01:03:30.476]  I'll quit promoting and I won't be for forced inoculation and things like that.
[01:03:30.536 --> 01:03:31.237]  It'll just go away.
[01:03:31.277 --> 01:03:31.617]  No, no, no.
[01:03:32.278 --> 01:03:34.440]  Because they were always planning to blame Trump.
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:39.004]  They were always blaming to try to tie the Republican leadership that they see Trump as part of to this.
[01:03:39.044 --> 01:03:42.207]  That's why he's got to overturn the whole thing and expose their scam.
[01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:45.090]  So he's probably thinking, well, this will blow over.
[01:03:45.110 --> 01:03:46.251]  They'll never expose themselves.
[01:03:46.311 --> 01:03:48.493]  No, all these Democrats are expendable too.
[01:03:49.093 --> 01:03:50.714]  We're in the endgame of the New World Order, Trump.
[01:03:50.754 --> 01:03:53.735]  You've got to either be against the Great Reset or be for it.
[01:03:54.616 --> 01:03:55.776]  That's what Drew Hernandez is saying.
[01:03:55.796 --> 01:03:56.776]  You've got to make a choice.
[01:03:57.837 --> 01:03:58.297]  Absolutely.
[01:03:58.317 --> 01:03:59.718]  I mean, look how they do this.
[01:03:59.758 --> 01:04:03.379]  They did this with the whole defund the police narrative.
[01:04:03.399 --> 01:04:04.320]  2020, defund the police.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:05.180]  We hate cops.
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:06.101]  We hate everybody.
[01:04:06.421 --> 01:04:07.261]  J6 happens.
[01:04:07.441 --> 01:04:08.682]  We love the FBI.
[01:04:08.882 --> 01:04:10.583]  We love law enforcement.
[01:04:10.803 --> 01:04:13.224]  President Biden, let's actually refund the police.
[01:04:13.384 --> 01:04:15.025]  You see how quick they can do this?
[01:04:15.465 --> 01:04:17.446]  Okay, they can do this because they know they can.
[01:04:17.846 --> 01:04:20.947]   Because they No, they can, and millions of people are going to be on board with it.
[01:04:21.307 --> 01:04:23.028]  President Trump needs to do this now.
[01:04:23.188 --> 01:04:28.651]  He needs to do this yesterday, because if this narrative goes way too far ahead, it's going to be too late for him.
[01:04:28.671 --> 01:04:29.291]  True, I totally agree.
[01:04:29.331 --> 01:04:30.672]  You keep saying he should have done it yesterday.
[01:04:30.732 --> 01:04:36.974]  How long does he have before he's irrevocably coupled to this and falls into their trap?
[01:04:37.314 --> 01:04:37.635]  Weeks?
[01:04:37.735 --> 01:04:38.015]  Months?
[01:04:38.965 --> 01:04:41.667]  I would say maybe the next couple months, the next few months.
[01:04:41.727 --> 01:04:47.392]  Because once they get this narrative installed, people are literally going to run on this, Alex.
[01:04:47.812 --> 01:04:50.874]  People running in the midterms are going to run on this very fact.
[01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:54.077]  And they're going to run ads of Biden saying, I don't trust the shot.
[01:04:55.097 --> 01:04:55.478]  Exactly.
[01:04:55.518 --> 01:04:56.899]  They were pre-planting that then.
[01:04:58.257 --> 01:05:00.218]  Alex, we think of that, it's like, what?
[01:05:00.798 --> 01:05:01.898]  How could anyone do that?
[01:05:01.938 --> 01:05:03.238]  Like, that's just a total lie.
[01:05:03.298 --> 01:05:04.279]  Nobody's going to believe that.
[01:05:04.619 --> 01:05:05.459]  Millions will.
[01:05:05.899 --> 01:05:08.140]  They shift the simulation whenever they need to.
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:14.021]  They do whatever the hell they... Listen, Alex, they did the same thing with the elections, right?
[01:05:14.041 --> 01:05:16.922]  2016, Russia, Trump rigged the election.
[01:05:16.942 --> 01:05:18.742]  2020, there's no election fraud here.
[01:05:19.223 --> 01:05:20.543]  They could do whatever they want.
[01:05:20.703 --> 01:05:22.126]  They're like, there's never been fraud.
[01:05:22.206 --> 01:05:23.628]  Anybody that says it should be arrested.
[01:05:24.029 --> 01:05:26.052]  And we have hours of them saying it's all a fraud.
[01:05:26.092 --> 01:05:29.318]  Electronic voting machines naming the very company suing Fox News.
[01:05:29.638 --> 01:05:31.141]  Four years later, it's never happened.
[01:05:31.201 --> 01:05:31.702]  It's insane.
[01:05:31.742 --> 01:05:32.163]  Exactly.
[01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:35.810]  Alex, here's why he can't wait too long.
[01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.470]  Okay?
[01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:43.675]  If you wait too long, they're going to come out and they're going to start to say, see, see, we knew it.
[01:05:44.095 --> 01:05:50.539]  Even he knows this is all his fault because now he's coming out and he's admitting, he's admitting that he did wrong.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:56.764]  You see, you see voters, you see America, President Trump knew all along that the vaccine wasn't ready.
[01:05:56.964 --> 01:05:58.345]  So that's what ruined your life.
[01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:01.086]  You're one of the smartest people I know.
[01:06:01.106 --> 01:06:01.867]  I'm not kissing your ass.
[01:06:02.227 --> 01:06:03.008]  You just have a way.
[01:06:03.268 --> 01:06:04.148]  I totally agree with you.
[01:06:04.529 --> 01:06:07.691]  What you've said is your mouth to God's ears.
[01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:09.612]  This is totally true.
[01:06:10.192 --> 01:06:12.874]  And if he waits too long, it'll be, oh see, he admits he did it.
[01:06:13.174 --> 01:06:14.415]  He's got to come out and expose.
[01:06:14.455 --> 01:06:16.777]  They set him up and set us up.
[01:06:17.037 --> 01:06:18.198]  He's got to do it now.
[01:06:19.449 --> 01:06:19.889]  Exactly.
[01:06:19.929 --> 01:06:22.311]  They tried to do the same thing to you with the Sandy Hook stuff, right?
[01:06:22.772 --> 01:06:25.534]  You've been saying for years, hey, you know, I apologize.
[01:06:25.574 --> 01:06:26.735]  I saw it wrong, whatever.
[01:06:27.015 --> 01:06:28.356]  But in the trial, see?
[01:06:28.636 --> 01:06:28.936]  See?
[01:06:29.197 --> 01:06:29.777]  He admitted it.
[01:06:29.937 --> 01:06:30.377]  He admitted it.
[01:06:30.417 --> 01:06:36.042]  But with President Trump, it's going to be even worse because he's actually waiting and not coming out and condemning it aggressively.
[01:06:36.062 --> 01:06:37.843]  All right, Drew Hernandez, amazing job.
[01:06:37.923 --> 01:06:38.644]  God bless you.
[01:06:38.684 --> 01:06:40.105]  We'll talk to you again very, very soon.
[01:06:40.145 --> 01:06:42.607]  People can just search engine Drew Hernandez at Allsraywork.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:56.227]  So, I'm a news junkie, and I read legislation, I watch foreign news, I listen to other shows that I respect, you know, I follow this stuff every waking moment, basically.
[01:06:57.308 --> 01:07:05.413]  And I mentioned at the start of the show the congressional report coming out and blaming Trump for the experimental shots and all that's happening.
[01:07:06.053 --> 01:07:07.174]  I told you that moment was coming.
[01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:16.253]  All the rats leaving the sinking ship, Berks, and Walensky, and Fauci, and the rest of them saying, okay, it didn't work, but it's Trump's fault.
[01:07:17.153 --> 01:07:33.359]  But even Dan Bongino, who's one of Trump's closest confidants, and who's the darling, you know, of the Republican establishment, I think he's a good guy, been a frequent guest on the show until he got a job at Fox, he's come out and said the worst decision of his life was taking the shot.
[01:07:35.719 --> 01:07:36.800]  All the health problems he's had.
[01:07:39.457 --> 01:07:46.620]  If Trump watches his own confidants coming out against it, what is Trump thinking?
[01:07:48.201 --> 01:07:50.422]  And so I was talking to the producer, Scott, during the break.
[01:07:52.603 --> 01:07:54.204]  He said, why don't you just set a date?
[01:07:55.084 --> 01:07:57.105]  It's not an ultimatum, because I'm not going to do anything to Trump.
[01:07:57.145 --> 01:07:58.666]  I'm just going to totally stop supporting him.
[01:08:01.087 --> 01:08:02.288]  Why don't we just set a date?
[01:08:03.954 --> 01:08:11.758]  Or if Trump doesn't come out and say, I was lied to, it's Fauci and Bill Gates, and it's a fraud, because they're already doing that themselves.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:15.500]  It means he's blackmailed.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:16.421]  It means he's bought off.
[01:08:16.481 --> 01:08:17.762]  It means he's dumb.
[01:08:17.782 --> 01:08:19.583]  I don't think that's the case.
[01:08:20.603 --> 01:08:22.124]  He's already gotten away from the shots.
[01:08:22.164 --> 01:08:23.345]  He won't say the vaccine word.
[01:08:23.385 --> 01:08:25.926]  He says, I'm still proud of the V word, but I won't say it.
[01:08:27.847 --> 01:08:29.108]  People say, move on from Trump.
[01:08:29.148 --> 01:08:30.889]  Well, I mean, he controls the Republican Party right now.
[01:08:32.267 --> 01:08:35.890]  So to get him on our side and to go after the globalist is critical.
[01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:38.352]  That would be a good thing to have him working for us.
[01:08:39.072 --> 01:08:45.217]  I'm not just trying to alienate Trump or ostracize Trump or shun Trump.
[01:08:46.879 --> 01:08:47.879]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[01:08:47.919 --> 01:08:48.640]  It's all coming out.
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:49.501]  They know it's coming out.
[01:08:50.121 --> 01:08:54.124]  They already had a backup plan to blame Trump and Trump's going along with it.
[01:08:54.184 --> 01:08:57.167]  So Trump can decide what he's going to do, but he has to do it very, very quickly.
[01:08:57.647 --> 01:08:58.568]  So I noticed a caller.
[01:08:59.861 --> 01:09:05.044]  Peter from Washington wanted to talk about Dan Bongino has turned on the vaccines, agrees with AJ.
[01:09:05.064 --> 01:09:06.765]  I thought, oh, I have that clip.
[01:09:07.305 --> 01:09:09.507]  We'll go to Peter in a moment, but here's Dan Bongino.
[01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:11.448]  Biggest mistake of my life.
[01:09:13.089 --> 01:09:14.630]  I just should have waited.
[01:09:15.655 --> 01:09:24.383]  I thought to myself at the time, I even told Guy, I said, you know, there's no doubt I feel like this was created and that this virus in a lab in Wuhan, China, I have little doubt about that.
[01:09:25.043 --> 01:09:29.947]  And I figured, you know, I'd rather take my chances with something we created than something they created.
[01:09:29.967 --> 01:09:31.068]  Remember when I told you that, Guy?
[01:09:31.088 --> 01:09:33.090]  Because I was scared.
[01:09:33.150 --> 01:09:40.216]  Again, you know, my doctor told me with lymphoma and being under chemo that if I got this thing, it could be ugly.
[01:09:40.256 --> 01:09:41.097]  Let's just leave it at that.
[01:09:43.098 --> 01:09:43.478]  Stupid.
[01:09:43.558 --> 01:09:43.778]  Why?
[01:09:43.798 --> 01:09:48.279]  I watched this clip from the Tucker Carlson Show citing some research coming out.
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:51.540]  And time has now passed and we're starting to see things.
[01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:58.362]  It's really the most troubling minute 20 seconds I've had to listen to in a long time because I'm scared of what's coming.
[01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:04.844]  I had it a little while ago and I'm afraid it's the repercussions of this for a lot of people have not been felt.
[01:10:04.964 --> 01:10:05.804]  Here, check this out.
[01:10:07.028 --> 01:10:15.467]  To Neurodegenerative Disease, Myocarditis, Bell's Palsy, Liver Disease, Impaired Adaptive Immunity, Impaired DNA Damage Response, etc.
[01:10:17.210 --> 01:10:23.372]  So it's possible, in fact it's looking likely, that the vaccine might suppress the immune system.
[01:10:24.313 --> 01:10:38.458]  This fact, the authors concluded, will quote, have a wide range of consequences, not the least of which include the reactivation of latent viral infections and the reduced ability to effectively combat future infections.
[01:10:38.858 --> 01:10:39.538]  End quote.
[01:10:41.348 --> 01:10:45.389]  Now again, we sincerely hope that's not true.
[01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:49.451]  But it's not just the conclusion of one scientific journal.
[01:10:49.851 --> 01:10:55.213]  The Lancet, maybe the most famous scientific journal in the world, released similar findings in February.
[01:10:55.253 --> 01:11:03.175]  The Lancet's piece was entitled, quote, Risk of Infection, Hospitalization, and Death Up to Nine Months After a Second Dose of COVID-19 Vaccine.
[01:11:03.895 --> 01:11:08.257]  A physician called Kenji Yamamoto made this observation about the data from the Lancet.
[01:11:08.757 --> 01:11:12.199]  He wrote this in a letter to the Journal of Virology, and we're quoting, Folks, science is patient.
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:12.820]  Science is long-term.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:16.840]   function among vaccinated individuals eight months after the administration of two doses
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:23.800]   of COVID-19 vaccine was lower than that among the unvaccinated individuals.
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:30.359]   Folks, science is patient, science is long-term, science is chronological.
[01:11:30.359 --> 01:11:38.280]   Okay, so now Dan Bongino tells us in the middle of 2022, and Tucker's talking about it.
[01:11:38.359 --> 01:11:38.759]  That's great.
[01:11:38.779 --> 01:11:39.540]  We appreciate them.
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:44.184]  We hit the barbed wire in February of 2020 and told you all this.
[01:11:44.684 --> 01:11:45.545]  We told you every day.
[01:11:46.206 --> 01:11:47.687]  That's why we're under attack, because we do our homework.
[01:11:49.761 --> 01:11:51.001]  It's not about who gets the credit.
[01:11:51.021 --> 01:11:57.563]  You need to know why we're marked for destruction because I don't know why these guys don't get it ahead of the curve.
[01:11:57.583 --> 01:11:58.983]  I mean, Tucker gets lost without the curve.
[01:11:59.983 --> 01:12:02.544]  But why they've got to actually see it all later.
[01:12:03.004 --> 01:12:11.526]  The CDC and the FDA, to cover their ass, put out a document in October 2020 predicting all the things that then happened.
[01:12:13.837 --> 01:12:16.298]  Because they want to later go back and say, oh look, we warned you.
[01:12:16.499 --> 01:12:20.941]  The bureaucrats cover their dirty little butts.
[01:12:23.102 --> 01:12:24.263]  They did this on purpose.
[01:12:24.303 --> 01:12:25.263]  They set Trump up.
[01:12:29.026 --> 01:12:31.187]  And now we're just sitting there floundering around in circles.
[01:12:33.688 --> 01:12:35.809]  But yeah, Dan Bongino now works at City Service Life.
[01:12:37.891 --> 01:12:38.711]  Yeah, what, promoting it?
[01:12:39.011 --> 01:12:40.072]  Yeah, remember that too, you know.
[01:12:42.622 --> 01:12:45.483]  Listen, I wish Dan Bongino was smarter than me.
[01:12:48.225 --> 01:12:50.266]  I wish all these people saw what I see.
[01:12:50.926 --> 01:12:51.707]  It's so frustrating.
[01:12:51.727 --> 01:12:52.407]  Like, I just see it.
[01:12:52.427 --> 01:12:52.947]  It's right there.
[01:12:52.967 --> 01:12:54.188]  A two-year-old can see it.
[01:12:54.608 --> 01:12:57.029]  And that's why Drew Hernandez is amazing.
[01:12:58.870 --> 01:13:00.751]  I'm good friends with Drew, and I've known him a few years.
[01:13:00.791 --> 01:13:03.572]  But man, he doesn't need to listen to Alex Jones to know what's going on.
[01:13:03.913 --> 01:13:05.053]  He's a Christian, born again.
[01:13:05.413 --> 01:13:05.874]  He sees it.
[01:13:05.894 --> 01:13:06.494]  He has discernment.
[01:13:07.435 --> 01:13:09.516]  Drew Hernandez knows every step they're going to take.
[01:13:09.856 --> 01:13:10.736]  He knows how to stop them.
[01:13:11.136 --> 01:13:12.737]  And there's a lot of Drew Hernandez's out there.
[01:13:13.317 --> 01:13:14.818]  I know you're out there listening right now.
[01:13:14.838 --> 01:13:19.499]  But I'm pissed off.
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:23.261]  Because I know we have the most important information out there.
[01:13:24.551 --> 01:13:25.492]  And I know we're embattled.
[01:13:26.392 --> 01:13:31.316]  And I've got to come and squeeze and beg the audiences to keep us on air every day, which I don't even want to do.
[01:13:31.396 --> 01:13:33.918]  I don't want to sit up here and push products and do all this.
[01:13:34.198 --> 01:13:35.599]  I bring you products that I think are great.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:40.803]  I know do a great job, but I'm so far beyond all this.
[01:13:40.964 --> 01:13:43.405]  I mean, you know, where are the wealthy people backing us?
[01:13:43.486 --> 01:13:45.367]  Where are the people that don't want to be slaves?
[01:13:45.407 --> 01:13:51.151]  I mean, we have world government, Mark of the Beast, implantable microchips, forced inoculations that kill us out in the open.
[01:13:51.472 --> 01:13:52.833]  Where is humanity saying no?
[01:13:53.132 --> 01:14:00.153]   That's why I love this audience of activists, because you care and you're involved and you're informed.
[01:14:00.153 --> 01:14:06.212]   So we'll go to break, I don't want to cut you short, and we'll come back and talk to Peter and others
[01:14:06.212 --> 01:14:07.432]  right through into the next hour.
[01:14:07.432 --> 01:14:14.112]   And then MTG, 15 minutes to the next hour, is joining us after she got SWAT team raided.
[01:14:14.112 --> 01:14:20.693]   Marjorie Taylor Greene, exclusive information, coming up in the next hour today.
[01:14:22.311 --> 01:14:27.292]   But yes, it's the last few days to get the book, The Great Reset and War for the World.
[01:14:27.583 --> 01:14:29.124]  We're sold out on unsigned copies.
[01:14:29.144 --> 01:14:30.805]  We just have signed copies as a fundraiser.
[01:14:30.845 --> 01:14:31.546]  Thanks for your support.
[01:14:31.566 --> 01:14:33.628]  It's your last chance to get signed copies.
[01:14:34.408 --> 01:14:37.471]  And I may do them again later once I catch up with signing them, but I gotta stop now.
[01:14:37.931 --> 01:14:38.972]  We're running this through Friday.
[01:14:39.373 --> 01:14:41.094]  The Great Reset and the War for the World signed copies.

[01:14:55.446 --> 01:14:55.946]  Like this.

[01:16:05.062 --> 01:16:07.183]  A lot of people are re-uploading online.
[01:16:08.516 --> 01:16:11.918]  VHS tapes they recorded of myself 20 plus years ago on air.
[01:16:12.698 --> 01:16:13.558]  They're going viral.
[01:16:14.239 --> 01:16:18.921]  And Instagram and TikTok and Facebook and Twitter take them down as fast as they go up.
[01:16:19.561 --> 01:16:21.602]  But despite that, they get millions of views a day.
[01:16:22.462 --> 01:16:30.866]  Here's a clip from 20 years ago, in 2002, laying out the basics of the New World Order.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.241]  Facts and common sense are in.
[01:16:33.341 --> 01:16:34.981]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires.
[01:16:35.122 --> 01:16:36.242]  Yes, they manipulate.
[01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:38.043]  Yes, there are secret societies.
[01:16:38.383 --> 01:16:40.504]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history.
[01:16:40.804 --> 01:16:57.552]  And yes, today, in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[01:16:58.527 --> 01:17:01.270]  Where human beings are absolutely worthless.
[01:17:01.831 --> 01:17:10.782]  There's six and a quarter plus billion of us, and the globalists have said it many times, there's too many of us, we're causing a problem, we need to be culled at the tune of 80%.
[01:17:10.922 --> 01:17:26.520]   It's amazing to talk about that, but it's the globalists, the UN, their own public statements, and they've convinced a lot of Liberals and elitist conservatives and others, that by going along with this, that we're intelligent members of society.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:30.441]  It's the ultimate Malthus worldview.
[01:17:30.641 --> 01:17:37.825]  It is this radical, virulent form of social Darwinism.
[01:17:37.925 --> 01:17:40.626]  It's the excuse of tyrants.
[01:17:41.744 --> 01:17:55.486]  And by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources, by centralizing and socializing health care, the state becomes God, basically, when it comes to your health.
[01:17:55.847 --> 01:18:02.748]  And then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us, we then basically get shoved into their system.
[01:18:03.748 --> 01:18:08.689]  There's thousands of hours of me predicting it all, and people ask on Twitter, he must be one of them.
[01:18:09.707 --> 01:18:11.848]  But I was sourcing their documents, their admissions.
[01:18:12.589 --> 01:18:14.090]  You could learn their documents as well.
[01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:18.273]  You could oppose them, my friends, long after I'm shoveled into my grave.
[01:18:18.893 --> 01:18:22.956]  I wanna go to Julie and everybody else, but Peter wanted to talk about this Bongino clip.
[01:18:22.976 --> 01:18:23.897]  Here's a short clip of it.
[01:18:24.257 --> 01:18:26.398]  Him admitting the worst decision of his life was taking the shot.
[01:18:26.939 --> 01:18:28.139]  Biggest mistake of my life.
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:31.322]  I just should've waited.
[01:18:32.344 --> 01:18:41.069]  I thought to myself at the time, I even told Guy, I said, you know, there's no doubt I feel like this was created and that this virus in a lab in Wuhan, China, I have little doubt about that.
[01:18:41.729 --> 01:18:46.632]  And I figured, you know, I'd rather take my chances with something we created than something they created.
[01:18:46.652 --> 01:18:47.752]  Remember when I told you that, Guy?
[01:18:47.772 --> 01:18:49.713]  I was scared.
[01:18:51.995 --> 01:18:53.315]  See, now they know it's all coming out.
[01:18:54.856 --> 01:18:55.637]  And Dan's not bad.
[01:18:56.897 --> 01:18:58.478]  And he's a leader, just not an alpha leader.
[01:18:59.539 --> 01:19:00.119]  A leader of leaders.
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:02.760]  Roger Hernandez is.
[01:19:04.341 --> 01:19:04.801]  And you are.
[01:19:06.862 --> 01:19:09.164]  We've got to say the tough things years before others do.
[01:19:09.184 --> 01:19:11.265]  We've got to take one for the team.
[01:19:12.285 --> 01:19:13.466]  That's what InfoWars is all about.
[01:19:14.746 --> 01:19:15.927]  Peter, go ahead from Washington.
[01:19:15.947 --> 01:19:16.447]  Thanks for holding.
[01:19:17.588 --> 01:19:18.108]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:19:18.976 --> 01:19:22.197]  The key about what Dan said is it was the worst decision he made.
[01:19:22.617 --> 01:19:24.398]  Children don't have a decision.
[01:19:24.918 --> 01:19:26.298]  Matthew chapter 18.
[01:19:26.678 --> 01:19:34.781]  But those who offend one of these little ones, better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
[01:19:35.341 --> 01:19:36.821]  Trump needs to change his mind.
[01:19:37.081 --> 01:19:39.202]  Second in that chapter, same 18.
[01:19:39.822 --> 01:19:49.640]   If you tell this person in private they have erred and they don't listen to you, if he shall hear the Thou hast gained thy brother, but if he will not hear thee,
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:54.591]   then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses,
[01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:56.521]  every word may be established.
[01:19:56.521 --> 01:20:03.520]   You and Drew Hernandez and Dan Bongino and possibly Tucker should tell Trump in a joint
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:08.121]   communication that he needs to change his ways to save children.
[01:20:08.147 --> 01:20:09.969]  Brother, that is beautifully the Bible.
[01:20:10.389 --> 01:20:12.531]  I remember that verse as a child in Sunday school.
[01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:13.892]  That is so powerful.
[01:20:14.253 --> 01:20:18.917]  Reprove somebody in private, give them a chance, but if they don't, go do a intervention.
[01:20:20.258 --> 01:20:21.659]  That's exactly the modern word.
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:25.062]  That's the modern word for what's in Matthew chapter 18.
[01:20:25.102 --> 01:20:25.983]  Read it again.
[01:20:28.519 --> 01:20:34.281]  Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone.
[01:20:34.761 --> 01:20:37.362]  If he shall hear thee, thou hast gained to thy brother.
[01:20:37.842 --> 01:20:46.244]  But if he will not hear thee, then take him with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.
[01:20:48.005 --> 01:20:50.485]  Because now we're gonna hold you responsible after the next warning.
[01:20:51.766 --> 01:20:52.126]  Correct.
[01:20:52.226 --> 01:21:07.302]   And then finally, in that Matthew chapter 18, verse 22, He basically tells Peter how many times he should forgive someone who has erred, and he says, I say not unto thee until seven times, but until seventy times seven.
[01:21:07.622 --> 01:21:18.906]  In other words, forgiveness is the cornerstone of Christian life, and we will forgive Trump if he amends his ways, and that's what we ask that he do for the sake of the children.
[01:21:18.926 --> 01:21:23.008]  Well, that's right, because if he's fully committed to evil, he'll never turn back.
[01:21:23.028 --> 01:21:25.389]  But if there's still a chance, we should still keep hammering.
[01:21:26.508 --> 01:21:27.909]  This is the gold standard.
[01:21:27.989 --> 01:21:31.512]  If he won't turn back here, what are we to do but move on?
[01:21:34.794 --> 01:21:35.534]  Powerfully said.
[01:21:35.554 --> 01:21:36.595]  What else do you want to tell people?
[01:21:39.237 --> 01:21:44.841]  That they should listen to you and read the Bible and see in the ways in which they both coincide.
[01:21:45.361 --> 01:21:51.378]   And also that I guess the key is that Children are the key.
[01:21:51.398 --> 01:21:54.720]  Show your love for Christ by your love for children.
[01:21:55.020 --> 01:21:58.002]  Show your love for your fellow man by your love for children.
[01:21:58.363 --> 01:22:02.966]  Recognize those children trust us and depend on us to look out for them.
[01:22:03.346 --> 01:22:06.948]  And that you have no greater duty than to help a child in need.
[01:22:07.209 --> 01:22:14.453]  And the children who may be vaccinated, who may have their lives ruined, who may never have children, you owe it to them to fight for them.
[01:22:14.613 --> 01:22:19.837]  And God will see your face and smile if you have stood for his littlest ones.
[01:22:20.077 --> 01:22:21.558]  Powerfully said, Peter, thank you.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:28.144]  Anytime I'm feeling sorry for myself, or even get a little bit scared, God goes, children.
[01:22:30.166 --> 01:22:31.106]  Children are under attack.
[01:22:33.488 --> 01:22:33.829]  Children.
[01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:39.774]  And then I, I don't have any hesitation then.
[01:22:43.597 --> 01:22:44.478]  That's, it's everything.
[01:22:46.257 --> 01:22:49.539]  And that's why everything the enemy is about is confusing and hurting children.
[01:22:50.420 --> 01:22:51.721]  God wants to protect children.
[01:22:52.461 --> 01:22:53.602]  Satanists want to hurt children.
[01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:55.163]  It's very simple.
[01:22:55.663 --> 01:22:56.484]  We don't have a choice.
[01:22:56.704 --> 01:22:59.184]   We're either going to defend children or we're going to join Satan.
[01:22:59.184 --> 01:23:05.904]  Again, it goes back to Scarface.
[01:23:06.730 --> 01:23:11.233]  Hypothetical movie written by Oliver Stone.
[01:23:12.474 --> 01:23:14.896]  Based on a decade of research hanging out with drug cartels.
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:19.522]  And there's a composite of true stories, like the Godfather's a composite of true stories.
[01:23:20.283 --> 01:23:21.924]  At the end, Tony Montana saves his soul.
[01:23:24.646 --> 01:23:27.688]  He's a killer, he's a criminal, he's a bad guy, but he's not going to blow up little kids.
[01:23:28.689 --> 01:23:29.689]  No women, no kids.
[01:23:31.711 --> 01:23:32.952]  Says, you think I'm a worm like you?
[01:23:32.972 --> 01:23:35.834]  You think I need this in my life?
[01:23:38.396 --> 01:23:41.157]  Trump means nothing to me if he doesn't stand up for the children.
[01:23:41.618 --> 01:23:43.079]  And he's been given a lot of chances.
[01:23:45.393 --> 01:23:46.894]  I wanted to trigger a debate about this.
[01:23:46.934 --> 01:23:48.274]  That's why this platform is so precious.
[01:23:48.755 --> 01:23:49.595]  This isn't about credit.
[01:23:49.795 --> 01:23:51.996]  It's about understanding what you've done.
[01:23:52.316 --> 01:23:53.637]  You built this operation.
[01:23:53.837 --> 01:23:54.857]  You're the only reason it's here.
[01:23:55.078 --> 01:23:57.659]  And we're causing major debate and having incredible victories.
[01:23:58.019 --> 01:23:59.600]  That's why we keep Infowars on the air.
[01:24:01.921 --> 01:24:05.302]  That's why the enemies of freedom hate this broadcast and it keeps them up at night.
[01:24:06.503 --> 01:24:08.764]  Because I don't claim to be Mr. Saintly.
[01:24:10.247 --> 01:24:15.770]  But I love God, and I see God working through me, and I see how I follow God's logic.
[01:24:16.210 --> 01:24:18.211]  The older I get, the more I submit to God's will.
[01:24:22.894 --> 01:24:24.434]  Let's go to Julie in Pennsylvania.
[01:24:24.755 --> 01:24:26.435]  Julie, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:24:27.236 --> 01:24:27.576]  Hello, sir.
[01:24:27.636 --> 01:24:28.437]  How are you?
[01:24:28.537 --> 01:24:31.238]  I know you've been going through a lot lately, and I'm sorry.
[01:24:32.319 --> 01:24:36.381]  Nothing compared to six-year-olds and six-month-olds giving shots, giving heart attacks.
[01:24:37.281 --> 01:24:37.721]  I'm fine.
[01:24:37.761 --> 01:24:38.182]  I'm a man.
[01:24:39.346 --> 01:24:40.867]  I'm doing great.
[01:24:42.348 --> 01:24:48.591]  I was very happy, or not happy, grateful to hear that Dan Bongino finally said the right thing.
[01:24:49.111 --> 01:24:52.613]  But what people don't understand, Trump had nothing to do with this.
[01:24:53.034 --> 01:24:58.357]  He was just being the businessman, trying to set up a vaccine to get people to go back to work.
[01:24:58.517 --> 01:24:59.637]  That's all he was doing.
[01:24:59.737 --> 01:25:00.278]  Exactly!
[01:25:00.398 --> 01:25:02.439]  But now that he knows, he's got to come out against it.
[01:25:03.425 --> 01:25:03.986]  Exactly.
[01:25:04.206 --> 01:25:11.233]  See, what he didn't realize was he stepped into a cauldron of evil that you couldn't...it was a black hole.
[01:25:11.774 --> 01:25:16.218]  And this already began back in 1999 when Bill Clinton left office.
[01:25:16.258 --> 01:25:22.502]   He signed a bill with the funding through the White House The Department of Navy Research and Defense.
[01:25:22.923 --> 01:25:28.407]  And what they did was, that was when they first created the nano industry that was funded by the Department of Defense.
[01:25:28.447 --> 01:25:28.767]  No, you're right.
[01:25:28.787 --> 01:25:34.171]  And then it was the Defense Authorization Act, and it was the Model Seasonal Emergency Act, 2001-2005.
[01:25:34.211 --> 01:25:34.651]  Exactly.
[01:25:34.971 --> 01:25:35.772]  We know who did it.
[01:25:35.792 --> 01:25:36.112]  That's right.
[01:25:36.152 --> 01:25:43.797]  All the patents are owned by the Department of Defense in cooperation with MIT and Harvard.
[01:25:44.078 --> 01:25:45.979]  And who was in the middle of that?
[01:25:45.999 --> 01:25:46.039]  BG.
[01:25:48.041 --> 01:25:51.002]  And we don't have to say anything more with his foundation.
[01:25:51.602 --> 01:25:57.004]  And he was the one who had orchestrated and he was with them there all the way through.
[01:25:57.404 --> 01:26:10.828]  In 2015, he came forward and in a symposium up and under MIT, he stated that they have tested this vaccine with millions of people already.
[01:26:11.349 --> 01:26:15.350]  And then he did that in cooperation with the Department of Navy.
[01:26:16.363 --> 01:26:20.728]  And that means they were already testing these things on our military.
[01:26:21.289 --> 01:26:21.910]  Absolutely.
[01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:27.316]  All of it was pre-tested, which is why the CDC knew it would cause heart attacks, infertility, blood clots, and death.
[01:26:27.396 --> 01:26:28.818]  Incredible call, Julie.
[01:26:29.158 --> 01:26:31.001]  Our callers are incredible.
[01:26:32.322 --> 01:26:32.703]  All right.
[01:26:33.203 --> 01:26:35.203]  More calls on MTG coming up.
[01:26:35.203 --> 01:26:44.203]  [Music]
[01:26:44.203 --> 01:26:49.882]   Ladies and gentlemen, if millions of people get this book, our funding problems will be over and it's starting to
[01:26:49.882 --> 01:26:50.203]  happen.
[01:26:50.383 --> 01:26:54.205]  That's why I said, yeah, go to Infowarshore.com, get the book, it starts shipping in a couple weeks.
[01:26:54.305 --> 01:26:55.625]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:26:55.666 --> 01:26:59.748]  But I said, go to Amazon, because it's the number one book chart in the world.
[01:27:00.088 --> 01:27:06.051]  And if it goes to number one, not of political, not of history, not of US history, it's already number one over 40 categories.
[01:27:06.351 --> 01:27:07.892]  Like political science, you name it.
[01:27:07.912 --> 01:27:09.574]  40 plus categories is number one.
[01:27:09.814 --> 01:27:15.219]  Ladies and gentlemen, drumroll please, of books in the world.
[01:27:15.319 --> 01:27:17.761]  The Great Reset and the War for the World is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[01:27:18.181 --> 01:27:25.181]  1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9. We are now number 9 in the world.
[01:27:25.181 --> 01:27:26.181]  Woo!
[01:27:27.169 --> 01:27:28.351]  This is political.
[01:27:28.371 --> 01:27:29.913]  This could fund our war chest.
[01:27:29.953 --> 01:27:33.077]  Just go to Amazon.com, everybody, and buy 10 copies.
[01:27:33.317 --> 01:27:39.425]  Send this blueprint to the Death Star and the New World Order, because you read this, you know their whole plan, how to stop them.
[01:27:39.505 --> 01:27:41.267]  Hit the Great Reset, the War for the World, now.
[01:27:41.387 --> 01:27:42.429]  It's gonna go to number one.
[01:27:42.489 --> 01:27:43.110]  What do you make of that?
[01:27:46.354 --> 01:27:48.476]  No one's ever done an interview with me with just sunglasses on.
[01:27:48.516 --> 01:27:53.619]  I have to keep them on to protect myself from the fire, which I'm about to bring to the world.
[01:27:53.859 --> 01:28:00.504]  Racism's for the poor people, because if you keep the poor people divided, they can't wake up long enough to do what I did and read about how money works.
[01:28:00.664 --> 01:28:02.345]  The future is based on enslavement.
[01:28:02.505 --> 01:28:08.450]  It's based on removing your freedoms, telling you you're going to be safe, to keep you believing the lies, and being a good slave until you die.
[01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:10.371]  It's almost like I predicted corona itself.
[01:28:10.571 --> 01:28:13.513]  You know, when Noah built the ark, he was a crazy right-wing conspiracy theorist.
[01:28:13.653 --> 01:28:14.714]  Until it started to rain, right?
[01:28:14.914 --> 01:28:15.775]  Now he's not crazy anymore.
[01:28:16.195 --> 01:28:23.458]  But now that we have the internet, and now people can look and fact-check things themselves, they're like, oh, okay, well, our propaganda mechanisms, they still work.
[01:28:23.558 --> 01:28:24.678]  Corona's proved a lot of that.
[01:28:25.178 --> 01:28:26.999]  They still work, but it's getting harder and harder.
[01:28:27.019 --> 01:28:28.399]  So we need to distract the people.
[01:28:28.899 --> 01:28:29.680]  We need to distract them.
[01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:31.140]  Did you know all the police are racist?
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:31.580]  All of them.
[01:28:31.881 --> 01:28:32.841]  Every single police officer is racist.
[01:28:32.861 --> 01:28:34.121]  Do you know they're going to kill you for no reason?
[01:28:34.161 --> 01:28:34.662]  Did you know that?
[01:28:36.342 --> 01:28:37.623]  It's a control mechanism.
[01:28:37.683 --> 01:28:39.263]  Who do you think is in charge of the world?
[01:28:39.283 --> 01:28:42.064]  You want me to go Alex Jones?
[01:28:42.324 --> 01:28:44.225]  On a level of 1 to 10, how Alex Jones do you want me to go?
[01:28:44.801 --> 01:28:45.982]  No, I want you to tell me what you think.
[01:28:47.463 --> 01:29:01.494]  Like, if you had to say, all right, there's all of this kind of coordination to some degree that's happening specifically around mainstream media, around the narratives that are created, and they're done with a specific purpose in mind.
[01:29:01.514 --> 01:29:05.978]  Who are the people who are planning that or trying to coordinate all this?
[01:29:06.018 --> 01:29:08.200]  Okay, so I don't think it's like dark room.
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:13.986]  Oh, it is actually kind of like this, but I don't want people to imagine I'm thinking as like dark room dudes sitting around making plans.
[01:29:14.086 --> 01:29:16.909]  It's kind of like that, but it's just, you know, dinner clubs and golf clubs, et cetera.
[01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:19.212]  What I truly... Not dark rooms, lighted rooms.
[01:29:19.252 --> 01:29:20.033]  Light, lit rooms.
[01:29:20.233 --> 01:29:21.855]  Yeah, lit, very fancy, nice rooms.
[01:29:22.395 --> 01:29:26.798]  No, but what I truly believe it is, is that every single human on earth tries their very best to propagate their worldview.
[01:29:26.958 --> 01:29:32.982]  For the same reason we're doing this podcast, we're trying to explain to people how we think based on our own experiences and how we think the world should be, right?
[01:29:33.643 --> 01:29:40.628]  So, if you have a worldview and you try your best to propagate it, the more powerful you are, the more influence you have over people, the more likely you are to influence your worldview.
[01:29:41.048 --> 01:29:42.169]  It's the same with any company, right?
[01:29:42.209 --> 01:29:46.552]  When you walk into your company at work, you want to say, look, do this, do this, do this, and people obey.
[01:29:46.912 --> 01:29:49.114]  You don't want to say, do this, do this, do this, and people disobey.
[01:29:49.574 --> 01:29:56.957]  So if you're a very, very important person and you're in charge of things, and you control, I don't know, all the food in a country, you don't want a minister that's going to give you trouble.
[01:29:57.337 --> 01:29:59.238]  Why would you want members of parliament to give you trouble?
[01:29:59.598 --> 01:30:00.338]  This is your country.
[01:30:00.358 --> 01:30:01.419]  You basically own all the land.
[01:30:01.879 --> 01:30:03.780]  So you want a minister who's going to say, yes, sir, no, sir.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:04.480]  It's your company.
[01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:09.242]  So the more powerful you are, the more likely you are to appoint people that enforce your worldview.
[01:30:09.282 --> 01:30:14.724]  And there's certain people in the world today that have so much influence, I don't even think they necessarily believe they're doing anything evil.
[01:30:15.084 --> 01:30:25.329]  But they think and view the world a certain way, and they use all of their political leverage, all of their friendships, and all their financial leverage to try and point the world in the direction they want it to go.
[01:30:26.169 --> 01:30:27.249]  And that's exactly what's happening.
[01:30:27.269 --> 01:30:28.230]  These are the people who control the world.
[01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:29.230]  The people who control everything.
[01:30:29.250 --> 01:30:30.030]  They control everything.
[01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:30.770]  They control the news.
[01:30:31.310 --> 01:30:37.712]  They decided, I'm not going to give my political views, but the people who own the news channels decided it was better if Trump wasn't in the White House.
[01:30:38.232 --> 01:30:38.992]  They thought, you know what?
[01:30:39.672 --> 01:30:40.592]  He doesn't listen to us.
[01:30:41.313 --> 01:30:42.553]  And I think I know best.
[01:30:43.273 --> 01:30:47.154]  And I want a president who's senile and will sign anything we give him.
[01:30:48.427 --> 01:30:50.250]  And that's why Andrew Tate is banned.
[01:30:51.031 --> 01:30:52.453]  You think the globalists love black people?
[01:30:52.473 --> 01:30:55.116]  They got a special place of hate in their heart for them.
[01:30:55.617 --> 01:31:02.307]  That's why they give them gangster rabbits while they ship in the cocaine and the guns, which are banned for the average black folks to have, but the criminals have.
[01:31:02.647 --> 01:31:03.108]  Here's a clip.
[01:31:03.612 --> 01:31:04.172]  It's crazy, man.
[01:31:04.192 --> 01:31:05.172]  Philadelphia losing its mind.
[01:31:05.192 --> 01:31:06.513]  People losing their mind out here.
[01:31:06.673 --> 01:31:07.373]  Bullets everywhere.
[01:31:07.753 --> 01:31:10.834]  Continued disgust over the constant violence citywide.
[01:31:10.914 --> 01:31:22.456]  Tonight, one man speaking with us under the condition of anonymity after he says he watched a brazen, bold shooter open fire on a group of men at 60th and Race Streets in broad daylight.
[01:31:22.856 --> 01:31:24.676]  In my apartment, I see a young boy walking back and forth.
[01:31:24.696 --> 01:31:25.737]  He got a full hoodie on.
[01:31:26.277 --> 01:31:27.197]  Full sweatsuit on.
[01:31:27.317 --> 01:31:28.357]  Kept looking at his phone.
[01:31:28.377 --> 01:31:29.557]  Looked at his phone three times.
[01:31:29.637 --> 01:31:31.998]  Put it back in his pocket and cut the corner and just started squeezing.
[01:31:32.472 --> 01:31:35.013]  Philly police say it was just after 5 p.m.
[01:31:35.113 --> 01:31:41.154]  when a gunman pulled the trigger on four men who sit in these chairs and socialize every single day.
[01:31:41.714 --> 01:31:43.515]  One of the four is now dead.
[01:31:43.535 --> 01:31:44.835]  We just heard a rabid gunfire.
[01:31:45.135 --> 01:31:48.056]  Yeah, it was a lot of shots and a little bit of screaming.
[01:31:49.417 --> 01:31:53.178]  Alright, I'm gonna jam in a bunch of calls next segment, then MTG joins us for two segments.
[01:31:53.918 --> 01:31:54.238]  And then...
[01:31:55.498 --> 01:31:56.758]  I really got ready for today's show.
[01:31:56.818 --> 01:31:59.999]  I've got energy cutoffs, attacking the children.
[01:32:00.059 --> 01:32:01.500]  I've got critical intel.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.420]  I mean, I got a lot of it.
[01:32:03.701 --> 01:32:13.964]  And then they gave me something about 20 minutes ago that is so big, I don't even... I'm not even sure I'm going to cover it on this show, because if I just in the last hour, oh, here's this huge thing, nobody cares.
[01:32:14.544 --> 01:32:19.785]  This, this stack of news here is big.
[01:32:20.926 --> 01:32:21.486]  El Grande.
[01:32:22.822 --> 01:32:25.825]  This, I will cover it at the bottom of the hour.
[01:32:25.845 --> 01:32:26.525]  Be right back, stay with us.
[01:32:27.286 --> 01:32:31.329]  Alright, I've absolutely got to hit all this breaking news, but we have MTG coming up.
[01:32:31.810 --> 01:32:37.414]  I promised to go to your phone calls, but look at this article by Jamie White with links to the announcements out of Canada.
[01:32:38.315 --> 01:32:45.441]  Ministry of Climate Change, Trudeau installing weapons armories, interrogation rooms for climate police force.
[01:32:46.361 --> 01:32:48.283]  I mean, this is the Great Reset.
[01:32:49.504 --> 01:32:50.085]  Unbelievable.
[01:32:50.825 --> 01:32:51.666]  That's coming up.
[01:32:54.042 --> 01:32:55.983]  Macron says the end of abundance is here.
[01:32:57.243 --> 01:32:58.644]  Just be ready to be totally poor.
[01:33:02.546 --> 01:33:04.086]  We have just got so much to cover.
[01:33:04.807 --> 01:33:07.568]  This news out of Texas is so big and is so positive.
[01:33:08.268 --> 01:33:12.270]  I'll hit it bottom of the hour and then all this other news in a big news blitz.
[01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:17.512]  But right now let's get to more of these callers that have been holding on the big subject I raised start of the first hour.
[01:33:17.532 --> 01:33:19.653]  We've been talking about this over two hours now.
[01:33:20.759 --> 01:33:23.562]  The Democrats saying Trump's to blame, the vaccine doesn't work, it's poisonous.
[01:33:23.862 --> 01:33:31.590]  Congressional reports, all these Republicans fleeing, all these minions that ran it, Fauci and others, and Burks coming out saying it didn't work.
[01:33:32.231 --> 01:33:36.495]  And Trump, she'll still sitting there, being set up.
[01:33:39.445 --> 01:33:40.486]  But who is responsible?
[01:33:40.526 --> 01:33:41.306]  It's the UN.
[01:33:41.406 --> 01:33:44.268]  It's the globalists that control the Defense Department that set all this up.
[01:33:44.568 --> 01:33:45.289]  It's Obama.
[01:33:45.869 --> 01:33:50.552]  And that's what I'm telling Trump, is he needs to go after the guilty, not the ones that set him up.
[01:33:50.953 --> 01:33:51.853]  But he's still sitting there.
[01:33:52.433 --> 01:33:53.494]  Dan in Wisconsin.
[01:33:53.514 --> 01:33:53.954]  You're on the air.
[01:33:53.974 --> 01:33:54.475]  Thanks for holding.
[01:33:55.736 --> 01:33:56.996]  Howdy there, Mr. Jones.
[01:33:57.077 --> 01:33:58.097]  Name's Trapper Dan.
[01:33:58.397 --> 01:34:04.201]  I used to mine in there, deep down there, and hunting wild game and devil hunting on the side there.
[01:34:04.822 --> 01:34:06.082]  But now I'm a trap, man.
[01:34:07.443 --> 01:34:08.324]  And that COVID...
[01:34:08.952 --> 01:34:10.053]  One big ol' trap.
[01:34:10.353 --> 01:34:11.513]  J6 big trap.
[01:34:12.074 --> 01:34:15.095]  I say, I say, I hate rabbits.
[01:34:16.476 --> 01:34:18.176]  Global homo and that devil.
[01:34:18.637 --> 01:34:19.837]  Trap, trap, trap.
[01:34:20.338 --> 01:34:24.139]  That rascally rabbit, I'll kill all of ya!
[01:34:25.340 --> 01:34:28.241]  I say, I say, boy, you bother me.
[01:34:29.942 --> 01:34:30.742]  Sorry there, boss.
[01:34:30.923 --> 01:34:31.723]  Sorry, go ahead there.
[01:34:36.468 --> 01:34:42.030]  So you're trying to get Mel Blanc's job as the Yosemite Sam or Foghorn Leghorn?
[01:34:42.050 --> 01:34:42.610]  Which one is it?
[01:34:43.871 --> 01:34:49.633]  Well, not your job, but I think some nobody set that trap for the Illuminati's sake.
[01:34:49.753 --> 01:34:50.994]  I appreciate your call, man.
[01:34:51.054 --> 01:34:52.134]  Very, very, very funny.
[01:34:52.254 --> 01:34:53.074]  Very, very funny call.
[01:34:54.495 --> 01:34:55.935]  I hate rabbits.
[01:34:56.376 --> 01:34:57.656]  Come, you'll hear.
[01:34:58.756 --> 01:35:02.078]  I'm the roughest, toughest hombre west of the Pecos.
[01:35:04.474 --> 01:35:08.335]  I mean, he's on the elephant, he's going, yeah, Mule, yeah!
[01:35:10.995 --> 01:35:11.835]  Oh, my Lord.
[01:35:12.535 --> 01:35:13.956]  You long-eared galoot.
[01:35:15.016 --> 01:35:15.776]  Very funny.
[01:35:15.896 --> 01:35:17.536]  Russell in Oregon, you're on the air.
[01:35:19.537 --> 01:35:20.657]  Alex, it's an honor.
[01:35:20.697 --> 01:35:21.177]  Good morning.
[01:35:21.617 --> 01:35:21.957]  Welcome.
[01:35:21.977 --> 01:35:22.397]  Go ahead.
[01:35:23.617 --> 01:35:28.998]  Well, first and foremost, X2 has saved my life, and I just wanted to thank you for that amazing product.
[01:35:30.079 --> 01:35:31.079]  It is game-changing.
[01:35:31.279 --> 01:35:31.759]  It is amazing.
[01:35:33.064 --> 01:35:33.305]  It is.
[01:35:33.925 --> 01:35:41.376]  I just want to bring up there's a video online of Bill Gates talking about meeting President Trump.
[01:35:41.826 --> 01:35:42.427]  That's right.
[01:35:42.247 --> 01:35:48.407]   of 2017 in the White House and Bill Gates says he asked me if vaccines weren't a bad
[01:35:48.407 --> 01:35:54.567]   thing because he was considering a commission to look into ill effects of vaccines because
[01:35:54.567 --> 01:35:59.567]   Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was advising him that vaccines were doing bad things.
[01:35:59.567 --> 01:36:00.567]  That's right.
[01:36:00.567 --> 01:36:03.586]   For those that don't know, you're quoting a video interview on National News with Bill
[01:36:03.586 --> 01:36:08.167]  Gates talking about how he convinced Trump to be pro-vaccine.
[01:36:08.704 --> 01:36:18.028]  Well, so the idea, well, he was saying that Trump was resisting, and because he had the advice of the great hero, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:36:18.428 --> 01:36:28.733]  And my question is, three years later, fast forward to March of 2020, and the pandemic is taking off, where was Robert F. Kennedy Jr.?
[01:36:28.773 --> 01:36:34.055]  Why did Trump distance himself from him and stop taking his advice?
[01:36:35.403 --> 01:36:46.811]  I think, and I know it's not a popular thing to say, but it's an issue of blackmail, and it's Bill Gates and the Clintons, and they had blackmail with Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:36:46.972 --> 01:36:47.932]  You know, it may be true.
[01:36:47.992 --> 01:36:54.978]  I've never seen evidence of Trump on the airplane or being to the island, but I mean, Trump is acting like he's blackmailed, Russell.
[01:36:55.438 --> 01:36:56.219]  I appreciate your call.
[01:36:56.439 --> 01:36:56.979]  Great points.
[01:36:57.540 --> 01:36:58.801]  Let's jam in another one here.
[01:37:01.030 --> 01:37:04.432]  I say let's take a call from Shea in South Carolina.
[01:37:04.452 --> 01:37:05.252]  You're on the air, Shea.
[01:37:07.253 --> 01:37:08.373]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[01:37:09.354 --> 01:37:09.934]  I'm in the fight.
[01:37:09.954 --> 01:37:12.375]  It's where I wanted to be, so it's definitely interesting.
[01:37:13.496 --> 01:37:14.176]  Me too, buddy.
[01:37:14.276 --> 01:37:23.460]  Well, I just wanted to absolutely say yes, Trump has to come out against this vaccine or the jab or whatever, and I believe he will.
[01:37:23.980 --> 01:37:29.743]  My husband seems to believe he's compartmentalizing and working with the voters, and that may be true.
[01:37:30.305 --> 01:37:37.547]  But his base is watching, and so if Trump is listening, your base can be a blessing or a curse, you know?
[01:37:37.567 --> 01:37:39.108]  It's your choice.
[01:37:39.928 --> 01:37:45.169]  And back to Trump, again, I believe he had to do Warp Speed.
[01:37:45.230 --> 01:37:49.411]  I think their plan was to keep us locked down for quite a long time, much longer than we were.
[01:37:49.431 --> 01:37:53.092]  I don't believe that he knew that this was a poisonous jab.
[01:37:54.332 --> 01:37:56.633]  And I believe absolutely he has to come out.
[01:37:56.913 --> 01:37:58.494]  He has to come out.
[01:37:59.134 --> 01:37:59.954]  Or all of us?
[01:38:00.623 --> 01:38:01.604]  We'll turn the other way.
[01:38:01.644 --> 01:38:03.765]  He will lose every single one of us.
[01:38:03.845 --> 01:38:04.346]  Period.
[01:38:05.667 --> 01:38:06.948]  Shay, thank you so much for the call.
[01:38:07.268 --> 01:38:08.148]  Thank you so much for calling.
[01:38:09.169 --> 01:38:10.470]  Let's talk to Matt in New York.
[01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:11.010]  Matt, go ahead.
[01:38:12.812 --> 01:38:13.932]  Yo, what's up?
[01:38:14.033 --> 01:38:28.503]  I think the main problem we got is that we're looking at individual pieces of the puzzle instead of putting the puzzle together and realizing that we had not one representative for us that's supposed to be protecting us from stuff like this.
[01:38:29.591 --> 01:38:32.292]  You're putting something with a 90% kill rate for a lung infection?
[01:38:32.452 --> 01:38:35.353]  I mean, Alex, you're a smart guy.
[01:38:35.373 --> 01:38:36.553]  I love you, brother.
[01:38:36.573 --> 01:38:40.034]  But I mean, if we look at the data, the cold and the flu went away.
[01:38:40.054 --> 01:38:41.014]  I mean, where did it go?
[01:38:41.034 --> 01:38:42.035]  You know what I mean?
[01:38:41.895 --> 01:38:46.855]   for a lung inspection. I mean, Alex, you're a smart guy. I love you, brother. But I mean,
[01:38:46.855 --> 01:38:52.615]   if we look at the data, the cold and the flu went away. I mean, where did it go?
[01:38:52.615 --> 01:38:58.695]   Which is, you know what I mean? Like, someone has to help me out because I don't see this COVID thing.
[01:38:58.904 --> 01:39:00.145]  I just see a big hole.
[01:39:00.205 --> 01:39:02.607]  It was definitely all hyped up to get us to take the poison shot.
[01:39:03.967 --> 01:39:05.989]  Yeah, I mean, that's all I see, man.
[01:39:06.029 --> 01:39:09.251]  I mean, like, I'll debate anybody now, and I'm a reported construction worker.
[01:39:09.571 --> 01:39:11.833]  But, I mean, I'm looking at... No, you're smart, brother.
[01:39:11.853 --> 01:39:13.694]  You got street smarts.
[01:39:13.734 --> 01:39:14.355]  So what do we do?
[01:39:16.256 --> 01:39:19.098]  We gotta, we have to try, a whole government has to stand.
[01:39:19.766 --> 01:39:25.866]   on trial and tell us why did we get locked down for a lung infection, okay?
[01:39:25.866 --> 01:39:33.146]   Why did you promote ventilators with a 90% kill rate for absolutely the
[01:39:33.146 --> 01:39:36.026]   wrong treatment for influenza? Well it was done because they wanted to start the war against
[01:39:36.026 --> 01:39:39.586]   small businesses and to collapse the world economy, which is now accelerated.
[01:39:39.586 --> 01:39:43.826]   Thank you Matt, great points. Wes in Kansas, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:39:43.826 --> 01:39:54.106]   Hey Alex, been listening to you for 20 years. I'm a Trump fan and I love him, but I can't help but think about maybe
[01:39:54.106 --> 01:39:59.025]   he's part of the plan because, you know, think about everything he's done when he was in office.
[01:39:58.999 --> 01:40:04.260]  You know, we still have the issue with immigration, taxes, Federal Reserve, you know, and now with the vaccines.
[01:40:05.341 --> 01:40:10.542]  So, you know, that makes me think maybe he's part of the plan and he's going along with it.
[01:40:12.082 --> 01:40:15.504]  I mean, I think if he doesn't start coming out now, he's with the plan no matter what.
[01:40:15.544 --> 01:40:17.384]  I mean, I think it's proofs in the pudding here.
[01:40:17.424 --> 01:40:18.965]  That's why we're talking about this.
[01:40:20.186 --> 01:40:20.626]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:20.646 --> 01:40:23.127]  Because all the key issues haven't changed, you know?
[01:40:23.667 --> 01:40:27.289]  So, I mean, where do we go?
[01:40:29.490 --> 01:40:30.871]  Powerful points, my friend.
[01:40:30.931 --> 01:40:31.611]  Thank you for calling.
[01:40:31.631 --> 01:40:33.052]  We're jamming in as many calls as possible.
[01:40:33.392 --> 01:40:34.312]  Matt in Massachusetts.
[01:40:34.332 --> 01:40:34.652]  Go ahead.
[01:40:35.913 --> 01:40:36.773]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[01:40:36.813 --> 01:40:37.274]  How you doing?
[01:40:37.394 --> 01:40:37.734]  Good, brother.
[01:40:37.754 --> 01:40:37.994]  Go ahead.
[01:40:40.287 --> 01:40:45.975]  I think that Trump has the majority of the blame here because he chose to listen to Anthony Fauci.
[01:40:46.015 --> 01:40:49.199]  His history with AZT and AIDS was out there.
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:54.246]  He chose not to partner with the frontline doctors and listen to what they were saying.
[01:40:55.174 --> 01:40:57.816]  He chose to listen to the pharmaceuticals and start Warp Speed.
[01:40:58.277 --> 01:41:03.641]  Why didn't he call other doctors around the country and hospitals and say, listen, what's happening here?
[01:41:03.781 --> 01:41:04.682]  Who is this affecting?
[01:41:04.742 --> 01:41:09.626]  He would have known that it affected mostly older comorbid people.
[01:41:10.166 --> 01:41:13.229]  And he could have stopped this in its tracks.
[01:41:13.409 --> 01:41:16.191]  At that time, we needed a leader, not a follower.
[01:41:16.511 --> 01:41:24.801]   We needed somebody to stop the vaccine and say, listen, let's just Wait, six months, let's see what's happening.
[01:41:25.181 --> 01:41:26.322]  I told my mother the same thing.
[01:41:26.662 --> 01:41:28.263]  She was indoctrinated by the MSM.
[01:41:29.103 --> 01:41:33.105]  She said, I need to get the vaccine so I can visit my grandkids.
[01:41:33.165 --> 01:41:35.026]  I said, wait, six months, just wait.
[01:41:35.647 --> 01:41:37.167]  And that's what we needed Trump to do.
[01:41:38.008 --> 01:41:38.488]  Be a leader.
[01:41:38.568 --> 01:41:39.168]  And he wasn't.
[01:41:39.348 --> 01:41:40.109]  And he failed us.
[01:41:40.409 --> 01:41:43.170]  And I was a big Trump supporter.
[01:41:43.551 --> 01:41:44.171]  No, I hear you.
[01:41:44.231 --> 01:41:45.251]  And I appreciate your call.
[01:41:45.932 --> 01:41:46.872]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:41:47.373 --> 01:41:49.734]  The point is, they're now openly setting him up.
[01:41:50.154 --> 01:41:51.995]  And so then Bill Gates and Fauci get off.
[01:41:53.632 --> 01:41:56.034]  Somebody wants to, like, say, get rid of Trump or defend Trump.
[01:41:56.074 --> 01:41:56.875]  Forget Trump!
[01:41:57.255 --> 01:41:59.517]  We need him to, like, go after the real people that did it!
[01:41:59.537 --> 01:42:02.219]  Because I know he didn't mastermind this.
[01:42:02.699 --> 01:42:03.720]  That's all I'm talking about.
[01:42:04.741 --> 01:42:07.023]  All right, we'll be right back with MTG.
[01:42:08.824 --> 01:42:12.728]  Well, we've got the exclusive response with Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[01:42:14.827 --> 01:42:17.450]  The most influential patriot in Congress.
[01:42:17.530 --> 01:42:19.793]  Fearless, smart, and amazing.
[01:42:20.193 --> 01:42:21.695]  That's why the enemy attacks her.
[01:42:21.735 --> 01:42:23.857]  That's why we celebrate her.
[01:42:24.418 --> 01:42:26.961]  She is breaking the heart of the New World Order.
[01:42:28.499 --> 01:42:30.120]  And she joins us for two short segments.
[01:42:30.661 --> 01:42:32.382]  She got SWAT teamed last night.
[01:42:32.903 --> 01:42:33.623]  We've had it happen.
[01:42:33.643 --> 01:42:34.824]  Steve Bannon's had it happen.
[01:42:35.245 --> 01:42:36.085]  But now they've done it to her.
[01:42:36.166 --> 01:42:37.607]  And the person took credit.
[01:42:38.207 --> 01:42:44.152]  National News is reporting because MTG doesn't want to sterilize little girls and little boys.
[01:42:44.453 --> 01:42:46.955]  So to give us the exclusive breakdown is MTG.
[01:42:47.275 --> 01:42:48.316]  God bless you, Congresswoman.
[01:42:48.336 --> 01:42:48.976]  Tell us what happened.
[01:42:50.398 --> 01:42:52.619]  Alex, thanks so much for having me on.
[01:42:52.700 --> 01:42:56.623]  I got SWATed last night because of the legislation that I introduced.
[01:42:57.059 --> 01:42:59.220]  Protect Children's Innocence Act.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:03.881]  And whoever this person is, they are going to hunt him down and find him.
[01:43:04.381 --> 01:43:15.464]  They called the 911 center and reported that someone had been shot in my home, and that there were children in my home, and created a scenario that there was still an active shooter in my home.
[01:43:15.864 --> 01:43:25.687]  Police, of course, our great local law enforcement here in Rome, came to my house as fast as possible, but prepared for an unknown situation.
[01:43:26.308 --> 01:43:28.537]  And swatting is extremely dangerous.
[01:43:28.597 --> 01:43:30.827]  The intent of it is to get someone killed.
[01:43:31.534 --> 01:43:35.157]  I, a sitting member of Congress, was their target.
[01:43:35.517 --> 01:43:38.279]  They wanted to get me killed, and that's why they called the police.
[01:43:38.739 --> 01:43:43.563]  But Alex, I want to tell you, our local police here, they're the good guys.
[01:43:44.023 --> 01:43:47.666]  They really are the good guys, and they handled everything really well.
[01:43:47.706 --> 01:43:52.549]  But it really scared me, and I can go into detail about how that played out.
[01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:55.812]  Lay that out, and then let's talk about the scumbag who took credit for this.
[01:43:57.057 --> 01:43:57.777]  Absolutely.
[01:43:57.957 --> 01:43:59.738]  It was just after one o'clock in the morning.
[01:43:59.758 --> 01:44:04.060]  I was sound asleep in my bed in my home here in Rome, Georgia.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:08.942]  Heard a knock on the door, heard a doorbell, heard people outside my house.
[01:44:08.982 --> 01:44:10.443]  I could hear them outside my windows.
[01:44:11.163 --> 01:44:12.944]  And I got up quickly.
[01:44:13.024 --> 01:44:13.804]  I got dressed.
[01:44:14.705 --> 01:44:18.286]  I saw a few lights outside, but it wasn't police lights going.
[01:44:18.306 --> 01:44:21.228]  I could just tell there were cars out there where they shouldn't be.
[01:44:21.248 --> 01:44:26.110]  And I actually, before I left my bedroom, I picked up my gun.
[01:44:26.871 --> 01:44:29.995]  As I always do to answer the door.
[01:44:30.736 --> 01:44:32.679]  Well yeah, you're a major target.
[01:44:34.207 --> 01:44:34.947]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:35.007 --> 01:44:39.669]  If you're going to come to my house and I don't know you're coming, I will answer the door with my firearm.
[01:44:40.049 --> 01:44:41.729]  And that's what people should do.
[01:44:42.189 --> 01:44:47.291]  But I had this really strange gut feeling, Alex, that something was wrong.
[01:44:47.391 --> 01:44:49.071]  So I put my gun down.
[01:44:49.452 --> 01:44:51.152]  And it's odd for me to do that.
[01:44:51.192 --> 01:44:52.052]  That's not normal.
[01:44:52.713 --> 01:44:57.514]  I went down the hallway, went into my foyer and saw police out on my front porch.
[01:44:57.634 --> 01:45:00.775]  And they looked extremely serious and very concerned.
[01:45:01.154 --> 01:45:05.953]   opened the front door and they immediately asked me, "Is everything okay, ma'am? Are you okay?"
[01:45:05.953 --> 01:45:11.715]   And of course, I was shocked and I didn't know what I was getting into. I didn't know if they
[01:45:11.715 --> 01:45:17.474]   were bringing me bad news or, you know, come for whatever reason.
[01:45:17.725 --> 01:45:21.146]  And I said, yeah, I was sound asleep.
[01:45:21.246 --> 01:45:21.847]  I'm okay.
[01:45:22.227 --> 01:45:23.347]  You know, what's happening?
[01:45:23.367 --> 01:45:26.708]  And that's when they informed me about the call that had come in.
[01:45:26.728 --> 01:45:30.649]  And I of course said, I was like, please come in my house.
[01:45:30.729 --> 01:45:33.690]  Please check my house and make sure everything's okay.
[01:45:33.790 --> 01:45:38.032]  My daughter woke up and she came out and of course she was scared too.
[01:45:38.092 --> 01:45:38.712]  We both were.
[01:45:39.592 --> 01:45:50.497]  Because it's really terrifying to have, you know, police come to your home in the middle of the night with a story like that and to know that you're being swatted.
[01:45:50.617 --> 01:45:51.897]  And the police knew it, too.
[01:45:51.977 --> 01:45:53.438]  They said, yeah, you're being swatted.
[01:45:54.076 --> 01:45:56.858]  And Alex, here's the issue that makes me so angry.
[01:45:57.418 --> 01:46:03.861]  Not only does it put my life in danger and my family's life in danger, it also puts the police officers' lives in danger.
[01:46:03.881 --> 01:46:06.262]  And that makes me very angry.
[01:46:06.342 --> 01:46:10.044]  But I have to tell you, our police here, they are amazing.
[01:46:10.064 --> 01:46:11.985]  They did a really good job.
[01:46:12.045 --> 01:46:15.207]  They understood the situation, took it very seriously.
[01:46:15.667 --> 01:46:16.607]  Yes, they do.
[01:46:16.467 --> 01:46:20.377]  was safe. They're continuing to watch it and and of course...
[01:46:20.377 --> 01:46:23.926]   I was about to say, my experience being swatted over and over again, we haven't talked a lot
[01:46:23.926 --> 01:46:27.947]   about it, is the police start watching your house more and and start protecting you even
[01:46:27.947 --> 01:46:35.197]   more because they realize you're being targeted. Yes they do and they're wonderful. I mean Alex,
[01:46:35.197 --> 01:46:41.499]   our local law enforcement, these are They get the crime off of our streets.
[01:46:42.259 --> 01:46:44.641]  They protect children.
[01:46:44.681 --> 01:46:48.445]  They go after the real criminals and drug dealers and all the problems we have.
[01:46:48.865 --> 01:46:53.008]  But they are lacking resources and they're lacking manpower.
[01:46:53.028 --> 01:46:53.709]  That's right.
[01:46:53.729 --> 01:46:57.212]  While they were at your house, there was car wrecks and robberies they could have been dealing with.
[01:46:58.556 --> 01:47:02.678]  Exactly, exactly, and it's such a waste of resources.
[01:47:04.179 --> 01:47:14.843]  Here's what it is, though, in my situation, considering the fact that this sicko wanted to have me killed by police at my own home and was willing to use the police to do that to me.
[01:47:14.863 --> 01:47:18.405]  It's really political terrorism, Alex.
[01:47:18.485 --> 01:47:20.366]  That's what this is, political terrorism.
[01:47:20.826 --> 01:47:28.470]  Because they think that they're going to scare me and intimidate me into not pushing my legislation and protecting kids.
[01:47:28.490 --> 01:47:33.052]  But I'm going to tell you, Alex, I am more committed to it than ever before.
[01:47:33.372 --> 01:47:37.574]  If they want to declare war on me like this, then they don't understand who I am.
[01:47:37.594 --> 01:47:47.198]  If I do anything at the end of the day, the only one thing I care about is protecting our kids and the left's disgusting, perverted, radical evil agenda.
[01:47:47.598 --> 01:47:56.564]  To force kids into these horrific general mutilation surgeries is something that I'll go all the way for.
[01:47:56.584 --> 01:47:58.005]  And they've got a problem.
[01:47:58.165 --> 01:47:59.666]  Even Bill Maher's turned against them.
[01:47:59.886 --> 01:48:01.047]  Even mainline Democrats.
[01:48:01.547 --> 01:48:03.148]  States are passing all these laws.
[01:48:03.528 --> 01:48:06.450]  People are really waking up to this pedophile agenda.
[01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:07.051]  That's what it is.
[01:48:07.091 --> 01:48:14.636]  Not just rape a child, but steal their identity and then take away parental rights and have them sterilized or mutilated.
[01:48:14.716 --> 01:48:16.717]  I mean, this couldn't be a bigger issue.
[01:48:18.234 --> 01:48:19.275]  I totally agree.
[01:48:19.375 --> 01:48:21.218]  And Alex, to me, it's like this.
[01:48:21.298 --> 01:48:24.101]  It's like the line in the sand for the Republican Party.
[01:48:24.621 --> 01:48:29.967]  If Republicans can't get on board and stop this, then what are Republicans even worth?
[01:48:30.148 --> 01:48:38.673]   I can't imagine a more important issue to create a federal law to protect kids from this disgusting,
[01:48:38.673 --> 01:48:42.594]  like you said, it is like pedophilia, it is child abuse.
[01:48:42.594 --> 01:48:47.233]   And we have federal laws that protect kids from child abuse, sex, child abuse, trafficking,
[01:48:47.233 --> 01:48:48.393]  all of these things.
[01:48:48.393 --> 01:48:54.913]   We need to protect our kids that are under 18 and stop this industry, this profit.
[01:48:54.913 --> 01:48:55.753]  Absolutely.
[01:48:55.753 --> 01:48:56.594]  And we need to do it now.
[01:48:56.594 --> 01:49:01.073]   Well, what's worse than raping a little girl or a boy, tricking them into signing up
[01:49:01.073 --> 01:49:02.634]  to have their genitals cut off?
[01:49:02.773 --> 01:49:05.033]  I mean, this is beyond pedophilia.
[01:49:05.053 --> 01:49:09.894]  This is literally a demonic child abuse cult.
[01:49:11.555 --> 01:49:12.695]  Yes, it is.
[01:49:13.075 --> 01:49:14.796]  It is a sick cult.
[01:49:14.956 --> 01:49:15.536]  That is right.
[01:49:15.676 --> 01:49:16.656]  Child abuse cult.
[01:49:16.956 --> 01:49:18.817]  And they're making a fortune off of it.
[01:49:19.177 --> 01:49:24.158]  And it's an industry that will only grow and they want to use federal tax dollars to fund it.
[01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:26.862]  That's another thing that is absolutely disgusting.
[01:49:27.202 --> 01:49:33.688]  And then, you know, there's an issue of some of my colleagues are arguing with me saying, you know, this is really a state rights issue.
[01:49:33.968 --> 01:49:34.669]  No, it's not.
[01:49:34.969 --> 01:49:36.351]  It's not a state's right issue.
[01:49:36.411 --> 01:49:37.772]  I'm a big believer in state rights.
[01:49:37.812 --> 01:49:38.733]  I believe in state rights.
[01:49:38.753 --> 01:49:41.215]  But if states want to legalize slavery again, they can't do it.
[01:49:41.235 --> 01:49:42.136]  We already had a civil war.
[01:49:42.156 --> 01:49:44.558]  Now they want to legalize chopping children's genitals off.
[01:49:44.578 --> 01:49:45.439]  We're going to have another war.
[01:49:47.206 --> 01:49:48.887]  Yeah, people are not going to stand for this.
[01:49:48.907 --> 01:49:58.274]  Especially, Alex, if you think about states like California, where they want to take away parents' rights to protect their children from this disgusting agenda.
[01:49:58.554 --> 01:50:00.215]  So kids aren't safe in California.
[01:50:00.255 --> 01:50:04.038]  That's why this is not a state's rights issue.
[01:50:04.098 --> 01:50:08.521]  This is a federal issue, and it is our duty.
[01:50:10.422 --> 01:50:11.303]  You're 100% right.
[01:50:11.343 --> 01:50:14.225]  I mean, it's a federal issue when there's child abuse happening.
[01:50:15.546 --> 01:50:16.926]  Yeah, but you know what Alex?
[01:50:16.986 --> 01:50:18.567]  I mean, you've been a victim of swatting.
[01:50:19.007 --> 01:50:20.387]  I've been a victim of swatting.
[01:50:21.468 --> 01:50:22.528]  This needs to end.
[01:50:23.068 --> 01:50:26.629]  These people that do this, they need to be held to a higher standard.
[01:50:27.429 --> 01:50:29.330]  There needs to be an increase in the price.
[01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:31.330]  As you know, swatting's got a lot of people killed.
[01:50:31.610 --> 01:50:32.891]  They need to be charged with attempted murder.
[01:50:32.911 --> 01:50:34.091]  We'll be right back with MGG.
[01:50:34.111 --> 01:50:34.551]  Stay with us.
[01:50:36.112 --> 01:50:58.913]   So, last night, after this individual called in a fake report of a shooting with children at Marjorie Taylor Greene's home in Georgia, It came out that the Rome Floyd 911 says the person called because they're mad at her for her transgender legislation to ban sterilizing children, which is just eugenics by another name.
[01:50:58.933 --> 01:51:00.014]  That's why they SWAT teamed her.
[01:51:00.635 --> 01:51:05.639]   I wanted to show you Just a couple of the current things in the news of how sick this is.
[01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:07.841]  This is mainstream news.
[01:51:08.742 --> 01:51:10.003]  They're doing this to kids.
[01:51:10.403 --> 01:51:21.773]  Boston Children's Hospital, says a link to the news, cut off flesh from a girl's forearm and thigh and remake that into a non-functioning penis.
[01:51:24.174 --> 01:51:25.556]  This is just mutilating children.
[01:51:25.576 --> 01:51:26.997]  This is like Hellraiser stuff.
[01:51:27.557 --> 01:51:32.021]  Sex Change Clinic sponsored conference that pushes child transgenderism.
[01:51:34.386 --> 01:51:37.110]  World's youngest transgender model, too transparent.
[01:51:38.993 --> 01:51:39.854]  That's just some of this.
[01:51:40.034 --> 01:51:44.641]  Marjorie Taylor Greene, you had more to say about this in your legislation to ban this garbage.
[01:51:45.102 --> 01:51:46.845]  Why the left is so incredibly angry at you.
[01:51:48.183 --> 01:51:52.684]  Yeah, so, you know, they think they're intimidating me with their political terrorism.
[01:51:52.744 --> 01:51:55.144]  I'm going to tell you something right now, Alex.
[01:51:55.585 --> 01:51:56.685]  They can't intimidate me.
[01:51:56.725 --> 01:51:59.465]  As a matter of fact, they've made me dig in even harder.
[01:51:59.865 --> 01:52:02.906]  So my bill is the Protect Children's Innocence Act.
[01:52:03.626 --> 01:52:10.568]  Anyone watching this, what you can do is you can call your representative in the House of Representatives and tell them to co-sponsor my bill.
[01:52:10.588 --> 01:52:12.508]  We need every single Republican on it.
[01:52:13.209 --> 01:52:18.982]  Because we have to start the push right now so that when we take back the majority in January, this is a bill that we can get passed.
[01:52:19.042 --> 01:52:22.169]  And I believe we can do it, especially if we're in charge in the House.
[01:52:22.685 --> 01:52:25.447]  So it's the Protect Children's Innocence Act.
[01:52:25.887 --> 01:52:28.669]  Make sure that your representative knows about it.
[01:52:29.009 --> 01:52:29.870]  And we also need it.
[01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:31.271]  We need a bill in the Senate too.
[01:52:31.311 --> 01:52:33.532]  We need a Republican in the Senate to step up and do it.
[01:52:33.953 --> 01:52:36.154]  I've already talked to Blake Masters in Arizona.
[01:52:36.214 --> 01:52:38.095]  He says if he's elected, he'll introduce it.
[01:52:38.416 --> 01:52:39.376]  I've already talked to J.D.
[01:52:39.396 --> 01:52:40.337]  Vance in Ohio.
[01:52:40.617 --> 01:52:42.598]  He says if he's elected, he'll introduce it.
[01:52:43.299 --> 01:52:45.700]  So we have brave Senate candidates that are willing to do it.
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:50.243]  And I want to see, I would love to see some of our current senators introduce it as well.
[01:52:50.263 --> 01:52:52.465]  But we need every single Republican on this bill.
[01:52:52.865 --> 01:52:53.946]  And it needs to be promoted.
[01:52:54.266 --> 01:52:55.167]  It needs to be passed.
[01:52:55.207 --> 01:53:01.572]  We need a federal law to stop this child abuse and protect children from those horrific images you just showed us.
[01:53:01.932 --> 01:53:12.420]  Because it truly is a sick and evil attempt to destroy children and radically change them into something they never want to become.
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.041]  So it's so important.
[01:53:14.301 --> 01:53:20.122]  Well, if I came into a hospital as a full-grown adult and said, I want you to cut my left arm off, they'd put me in a mental institution.
[01:53:20.462 --> 01:53:21.823]  Or if I said, I want you to cut my finger off.
[01:53:22.143 --> 01:53:25.944]  But, oh, cut a little girl's arm off and then make it into a fake genitals.
[01:53:25.984 --> 01:53:28.504]  I mean, it's just, it doesn't even make, it's insane.
[01:53:29.024 --> 01:53:33.646]  And they're just doing it and it's incredible and it's time to start saying no and that's happening.
[01:53:33.666 --> 01:53:34.366]  You're leading the charge.
[01:53:34.386 --> 01:53:35.186]  We're so proud of you.
[01:53:36.026 --> 01:53:39.547]  You wanted to talk about the difference, we talked during the break, between federal and local law enforcement.
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:42.061]  Yes, there is a difference.
[01:53:42.121 --> 01:53:51.929]  Now, the left has the defund the police movement, which we know is causing lawlessness all over America, and the crime rates are the proof.
[01:53:51.969 --> 01:53:53.630]  This is exactly what they want.
[01:53:53.971 --> 01:53:55.192]  They want lawlessness.
[01:53:55.412 --> 01:53:57.854]  The Democrats, the left, they're the party of lawlessness.
[01:53:58.554 --> 01:54:00.216]  Because they thrive on chaos.
[01:54:00.617 --> 01:54:04.721]  Now I had recently said defund the FBI after they raided Mar-a-Lago.
[01:54:05.062 --> 01:54:13.111]  Now what I'm talking about with defund the FBI is we have got to gut these federal agencies of these unelected bureaucrats.
[01:54:13.951 --> 01:54:23.134]  And this is something that our federal government should never become, should never be.
[01:54:23.494 --> 01:54:27.436]  As a matter of fact, this is exactly what our founders warned us against.
[01:54:28.076 --> 01:54:33.958]  But what we have to do, Alex, as Republicans, is we can't just talk about it and say it on the news.
[01:54:34.078 --> 01:54:37.479]  We can't just hold committee hearings and investigations.
[01:54:37.859 --> 01:54:41.761]  So that Republican members of Congress can pump out their five-minute C-SPAN clips.
[01:54:42.141 --> 01:54:47.723]  We need real action and accountability following what we find out and what we expose.
[01:54:48.003 --> 01:54:50.024]  Because otherwise, what is the point?
[01:54:50.304 --> 01:54:55.326]  What is the point of having the majority and actually controlling and having power?
[01:54:57.126 --> 01:55:04.089]  And stop the weaponization of the federal government against their enemies and against the innocent American people.
[01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:06.310]  It has to end and we have to do something about it.
[01:55:06.670 --> 01:55:08.252]  Well, that's why they're so scared of you.
[01:55:08.793 --> 01:55:09.574]  Shifting gears.
[01:55:09.814 --> 01:55:10.755]  Fauci leaving.
[01:55:11.236 --> 01:55:13.079]  Burke's admitting the shots didn't work.
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:18.305]  Uh, the... Walensky, the current head of the CDC, saying, okay, we lied to you.
[01:55:20.273 --> 01:55:22.495]  It was the Democrats that tried forced inoculation.
[01:55:22.515 --> 01:55:24.037]  The Democrats that pushed lockdown.
[01:55:24.517 --> 01:55:25.979]  Trump just said, if you want to take it, take it.
[01:55:26.159 --> 01:55:32.065]  But I really want to see Trump, now that the rats are leaving the sinking ship, come out and point out it was Bill Gates and Fauci and them.
[01:55:32.105 --> 01:55:38.311]  I see the thing hurting Trump more than anything, which I don't want to happen, is that he hasn't come out and admitted that he was lied to.
[01:55:38.912 --> 01:55:41.054]  Just big picture, what do you make of Fauci leaving?
[01:55:42.614 --> 01:55:45.957]  Well, what I make of Fauci leaving is I see it completely different.
[01:55:46.057 --> 01:55:50.942]  I don't think Fauci gets to just decide he's done and gets to go home and enjoy retirement.
[01:55:51.282 --> 01:55:52.023]  No, I don't think so.
[01:55:52.063 --> 01:55:55.626]  This is the man that lied to us on television every single day.
[01:55:55.906 --> 01:56:00.230]  He lied under oath to Congress and in congressional hearings in the House and the Senate.
[01:56:00.530 --> 01:56:13.721]   He has lied and lied and he was completely involved in a total part of our tax dollars Going towards this gain-of-function research, creating the COVID-19 virus, which was created in the Wuhan lab.
[01:56:14.281 --> 01:56:16.823]  The virus gets unleashed all over the world.
[01:56:16.923 --> 01:56:18.864]  It has killed millions of people.
[01:56:19.324 --> 01:56:28.511]  I mean, you think about the elderly, our parents and grandparents that died in nursing homes alone, people that died in hospitals alone.
[01:56:29.291 --> 01:56:36.978]  People that were forced to take this vaccine that Dr. Fauci promoted and promoted and promoted, and Alex, now we're seeing the vaccine does nothing for them.
[01:56:37.378 --> 01:56:43.303]  And the people that are vaccinated, quadruple vaccinated, they're the ones getting COVID over and over again.
[01:56:43.623 --> 01:56:44.244]  It's not us.
[01:56:44.384 --> 01:56:45.405]  I'm not vaccinated.
[01:56:45.485 --> 01:56:48.628]  I've had COVID one time, and I have not had it since.
[01:56:49.188 --> 01:56:54.374]  And we don't know what it's doing to people's bodies, the mRNA vaccine technology.
[01:56:54.514 --> 01:56:59.700]  And we've seen doctors and many medical experts come out and warn against it.
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:01.622]  And then they're canceled by big tech.
[01:57:02.042 --> 01:57:03.884]  We have the VAERS system.
[01:57:04.004 --> 01:57:05.546]  Let's talk about that for a second, Alex.
[01:57:05.565 --> 01:57:10.565]  I also have a bill to Justice for Vaccine Victims Act.
[01:57:10.565 --> 01:57:16.805]   What it does is it investigates all of the reports of vaccine injuries and deaths on VAERS.
[01:57:16.805 --> 01:57:18.105]  And there's so many.
[01:57:18.105 --> 01:57:24.005]   These people are being silenced and ignored while Pfizer has the liability protection
[01:57:24.005 --> 01:57:29.284]   and gets to just make a fortune, so much money off of these vaccines
[01:57:29.284 --> 01:57:34.065]   that were mandated and forced on countless numbers of Americans.
[01:57:34.065 --> 01:57:35.865]  and that should have never happened.
[01:57:35.968 --> 01:57:44.314]  So when it comes to Dr. Fauci and anyone in the CDC and anyone in our government agencies and our federal government, you know what?
[01:57:44.615 --> 01:57:45.996]  They should be held accountable.
[01:57:46.336 --> 01:57:47.597]  Fauci doesn't get to go home.
[01:57:47.677 --> 01:57:49.078]  He should be put in jail.
[01:57:49.439 --> 01:57:51.520]  That is exactly where that man belongs.
[01:57:51.861 --> 01:58:00.668]  And other people that were involved in that, they should go to jail because millions of people died and millions of people were forced to take a vaccine they didn't want to take.
[01:58:01.068 --> 01:58:09.710]  And have suffered, they've suffered miscarriages, they have suffered myocarditis, they have suffered neurological problems, the list goes on and on and on.
[01:58:10.010 --> 01:58:13.691]  And then there's people that have died and no one is, you're not allowed to talk about that.
[01:58:14.031 --> 01:58:20.332]  Oh no, you can't talk about it because if you talk about it, then, oh, you're spreading vaccine misinformation.
[01:58:20.452 --> 01:58:21.093]  Well, you know what?
[01:58:21.513 --> 01:58:22.513]  I don't really give a damn.
[01:58:22.633 --> 01:58:23.733]  I think we need to talk about it.
[01:58:23.753 --> 01:58:31.096]   It has to be talked about because people's lives were affected And people potentially died, and that needs to be investigated.
[01:58:31.196 --> 01:58:35.758]  And if all of that is true, which I believe it is, then people should go to jail.
[01:58:35.938 --> 01:58:37.818]  And Dr. Fauci is top on that list.
[01:58:37.919 --> 01:58:38.559]  Absolutely.
[01:58:38.719 --> 01:58:41.640]  MTG4America.com.

[01:58:55.134 --> 01:58:58.356]  Thank God she or the police or daughter didn't get hurt last night.
[01:58:58.396 --> 01:58:59.537]  Thank you, Marjorie Taylor Greene.

[01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:06.601]  I'm not sure.
[01:59:07.001 --> 01:59:08.542]  But we've just got so much to hit here.

[02:00:14.532 --> 02:00:15.293]  Yeah, it's on.
[02:00:17.155 --> 02:00:18.036]  Nobody else is doing it.
[02:00:18.056 --> 02:00:19.117]  We're just being shut down.
[02:00:20.899 --> 02:00:22.280]  But folks are striking back.
[02:00:22.340 --> 02:00:24.543]  And my state isn't perfect, but I'm proud of Texas.
[02:00:26.004 --> 02:00:27.904]  Go woke, get the hell out!
[02:00:28.004 --> 02:00:33.886]  Texas bans Wall Street giants BlackRock, Credit Suisse, and others over energy boycott.
[02:00:33.906 --> 02:00:37.767]  It's a big zero hedge article we're posting at InfoWars.com.
[02:00:37.827 --> 02:00:44.027]   BlackRock, BNP, Credit Suisse, and others are among the first firms that Texas has just
[02:00:44.027 --> 02:00:49.707]   issued what will now be banned from working with the state due to their hostility to the
[02:00:49.707 --> 02:00:50.707]  energy industry.
[02:00:50.707 --> 02:00:56.106]   After almost a year of suspense that caused banks, businesses in Texas, and multi-municipal
[02:00:56.106 --> 02:01:02.627]   bond issuance avoidance firms, which status is unclear, but the Pro Bloomberg reports
[02:01:02.627 --> 02:01:08.387]   that Glenn Hegger, the Republican state comptroller on Wednesday, named the firms he will prohibit
[02:01:08.387 --> 02:01:12.427]   from entering into the most contracts with the state and its local entities after the
[02:01:12.427 --> 02:01:15.827]  office found the boycott of the fossil fuel sector.
[02:01:15.827 --> 02:01:18.827]  This is the opposite of SEGs.
[02:01:18.827 --> 02:01:22.945]   SEGs are where they get local, state, and federal national governments around the world
[02:01:22.945 --> 02:01:27.667]   to say you can only spend money with the globalists and all their failed stuff designed to destroy
[02:01:27.667 --> 02:01:28.306]  civilization.
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:30.942]  This is saying we're not doing business with you.
[02:01:32.343 --> 02:01:33.524]  And this is how you strike back.
[02:01:35.005 --> 02:01:43.812]  More than 150 firms were sent detailed inquiries requesting information on whether they were shunning the oil and gas industry in favor of sustainable investment and financial goals.
[02:01:44.113 --> 02:01:48.076]  Remember, they're not doing drilling in Texas now, but they're doing it in Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.
[02:01:49.491 --> 02:02:02.900]  As a reminder, the survey was triggered by GOP-backed state law that took effect on September 1st, 2021, which limits Texas governments from entering into certain contracts with firms that have curbed ties with carbon-emitting energy companies.
[02:02:04.601 --> 02:02:05.842]  And it goes on from there.
[02:02:06.543 --> 02:02:09.705]  So Larry Fink is not a happy New World Order camper.
[02:02:10.906 --> 02:02:14.308]  Here is the announcement by the comptroller in Texas.
[02:02:15.868 --> 02:02:19.249]  This is some good, good, good news.
[02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:23.711]  It lists all the companies banned from doing business with the state.
[02:02:23.731 --> 02:02:24.932]  They want to cut our energy off?
[02:02:25.052 --> 02:02:27.513]  We cut them off from the taxpayer.
[02:02:28.073 --> 02:02:35.536]  Meanwhile, Ministry of Climate Change Trudeau installing weapons armories, interrogation rooms for climate police force.
[02:02:35.917 --> 02:02:38.438]  What did they say two years ago during the lockdown?
[02:02:38.478 --> 02:02:42.880]  They said next is carbon lockdowns and green police.
[02:02:44.025 --> 02:02:46.347]  Big article up on InfoWars.com.
[02:02:46.387 --> 02:02:47.148]  You should share it.
[02:02:47.769 --> 02:02:49.731]  Just because you know it doesn't mean other people don't.
[02:02:50.031 --> 02:02:50.952]  And I'm not patronizing.
[02:02:50.972 --> 02:02:54.695]  I'm just saying stop thinking you're just an audience member.
[02:02:54.715 --> 02:02:55.756]  I know most of you know that.
[02:02:56.097 --> 02:02:58.519]  But for those that don't, you are the victory.
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:03.464]  If the situation was hopeless, the propaganda would not be necessary.
[02:03:03.544 --> 02:03:04.325]  Such a big article.
[02:03:04.705 --> 02:03:05.226]  This we could do.
[02:03:06.741 --> 02:03:12.044]  I mean, the detention camps, the interrogation centers, I mean, this alone, they're admitting it!
[02:03:12.064 --> 02:03:14.745]  I mean, this is a three-hour, four-hour show right here!
[02:03:14.765 --> 02:03:19.468]  I mean, this is incredible!
[02:03:21.228 --> 02:03:24.810]  And you see that Super Bowl ad from 12 years ago, and you realize it's not a joke.
[02:03:25.611 --> 02:03:28.852]  Macron warns of the end of abundance as France faces difficult winter.
[02:03:29.173 --> 02:03:30.994]  Says it's for the earth to cut carbon.
[02:03:31.374 --> 02:03:34.335]  They want to make you poor by design.
[02:03:34.355 --> 02:03:35.476]  And then I have the article here.
[02:03:36.937 --> 02:03:38.138]  For some reason, I can't find it.
[02:03:38.158 --> 02:03:38.838]  Well, you guys punched it up.
[02:03:38.878 --> 02:03:39.939]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[02:03:40.519 --> 02:03:50.306]  California bureaucracy announces regulations to ban gasoline and diesel engines starting next year, phased into the next decade.
[02:03:52.527 --> 02:03:54.569]  By listing carbon dioxide as a deadly poison.
[02:03:55.169 --> 02:03:56.090]  Top story on InfoWars.
[02:03:56.710 --> 02:03:57.071]  That is it.
[02:03:57.091 --> 02:03:57.471]  Refresh.
[02:03:57.951 --> 02:03:58.732]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:04:00.213 --> 02:04:01.475]  I can pull up on my phone actually.
[02:04:02.416 --> 02:04:02.817]  There it is.
[02:04:03.117 --> 02:04:06.642]  California demands sale of new gasoline powered cars by 2035.
[02:04:08.285 --> 02:04:10.308]  But the key is it's being phased in now.
[02:04:13.186 --> 02:04:15.627]  And they don't have the power plants to even charge the electric cars.
[02:04:15.687 --> 02:04:22.529]  Currently, electric cars are dozens of times more toxic than gas-powered cars, but the car companies are following orders.
[02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:31.812]  Ford, Chevy, Dodge, they've all announced no more gas cars within five years, and they just canceled the Hellcat Challenger and the Hellcat Dodge.
[02:04:32.592 --> 02:04:35.753]  And I've owned both those cars as a therapy animal.
[02:04:36.213 --> 02:04:39.094]  Just the rumbling of that Hemi engine is very relaxing.
[02:04:40.694 --> 02:04:42.795]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:44.757 --> 02:04:50.663]  Unbelievable developments on every single front.
[02:04:53.525 --> 02:04:54.946]  And then I've got stories like these.
[02:04:56.328 --> 02:04:56.748]  Another U.N.
[02:04:57.188 --> 02:04:59.470]  official arrested for rape.
[02:05:00.311 --> 02:05:03.734]  Charges drop because they have diplomatic immunity.
[02:05:04.035 --> 02:05:05.376]  Isn't that just cute?
[02:05:06.056 --> 02:05:06.197]  U.N.
[02:05:06.217 --> 02:05:09.880]  diplomat dodges New York City rape rap, thinks diplomatic immunity.
[02:05:13.075 --> 02:05:16.017]  And it just goes on and on and on from there.
[02:05:17.097 --> 02:05:18.678]  But then I see stories like this one.
[02:05:19.939 --> 02:05:22.020]  Sometimes they say a picture tells a thousand words.
[02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:23.601]  This tells a million words.
[02:05:24.521 --> 02:05:35.347]  That weird demon creature that's running for the Senate in Pennsylvania, John Fetterman, is now in new videos where he can't even talk.
[02:05:36.007 --> 02:05:38.769]  Well, that's a prerequisite to be a New World Order minion like Biden.
[02:05:39.849 --> 02:05:45.981]   John Fetterman speaking Incomplete sentences continues to be a struggle.
[02:05:47.121 --> 02:05:57.424]  The guy is a total tyrant, and he's one of the main people for the Democrats in Texas that run the border, smuggling hundreds of thousands of children into a black hole in Pennsylvania.
[02:05:57.905 --> 02:06:00.405]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is your enemy.
[02:06:01.386 --> 02:06:08.248]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is a demon creature on display at every single level.
[02:06:08.308 --> 02:06:09.108]  Now, let me hit this.
[02:06:11.721 --> 02:06:14.762]  Because this is a big, big deal.
[02:06:17.243 --> 02:06:20.304]  You knew this was coming, and you know a man buys enemies.
[02:06:24.566 --> 02:06:29.007]  The very same law firm that bankrupted Remington is quarterbacking all the lawsuits against us.
[02:06:29.847 --> 02:06:33.889]  But I'll be in trial in three weeks in Connecticut where the judge already says I'm guilty.
[02:06:35.666 --> 02:06:42.229]  Is quarterbacking the lawsuits for $27 billion against the state of Texas.
[02:06:43.689 --> 02:06:45.730]  The local police chief ordered the police stand down.
[02:06:45.770 --> 02:06:48.371]  The state police showed up 30 minutes into it.
[02:06:48.931 --> 02:06:52.212]  I'm not absolving them, but taxpayers shouldn't have to pay for that.
[02:06:52.392 --> 02:06:53.793]  It's not the police job to protect you.
[02:06:53.873 --> 02:06:55.033]  It's your job to protect you.
[02:06:56.114 --> 02:07:09.973]   But what Yuvaldi was terrible, but the same ambulance chasers that don't want us to be able to be armed are now suing the state of Texas The state police, the Texas Rangers, and the Border Patrol.
[02:07:09.993 --> 02:07:12.598]  Well, let's sue the lawyers.
[02:07:12.618 --> 02:07:13.639]  They didn't show up either.
[02:07:15.542 --> 02:07:15.963]  For $27 billion.
[02:07:19.468 --> 02:07:24.429]  Yeah, first they start out with Remington, then they go to Alex Jones, and now they move on to Texas.
[02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:34.512]  Yovaldi families to sue gun manufacturer Gun Store as part of massive $27 billion lawsuit, including Daniel Defense, and it gets better.
[02:07:35.352 --> 02:07:36.472]  This is ABC News.
[02:07:36.893 --> 02:07:46.015]  Father of Yovaldi's shooting victim retains lawyer who sued makers of rifle used at Sandy Hook, Koskoff & Koskoff of Connecticut.
[02:07:50.967 --> 02:07:51.648]  Meanwhile, the U.S.
[02:07:51.668 --> 02:07:58.754]  government warned against warrantless gun checks going to people's houses while the border is wide open.
[02:08:00.415 --> 02:08:01.075]  So I told you!
[02:08:01.396 --> 02:08:03.017]  You were like, how are you handling it, Jones?
[02:08:03.077 --> 02:08:03.738]  What's it like?
[02:08:03.798 --> 02:08:09.483]  You know, they're... They come after who's in their way.
[02:08:10.583 --> 02:08:12.705]  And I told you, it's Alex Jones today, it's you tomorrow.
[02:08:12.945 --> 02:08:18.509]   And now the taxpayers of Texas These very groups are trying to disarm Beto O'Rourke.
[02:08:18.549 --> 02:08:20.109]  Hell yes, we'll ban your semi-auto.
[02:08:20.669 --> 02:08:35.134]  Now they want $27 billion of taxpayer money to pay the gun control law firms who are suing everybody, including people that were killed by guns in Fast and Furious.
[02:08:35.434 --> 02:08:37.555]  Eric Holder ships the guns in secretly.
[02:08:37.815 --> 02:08:39.215]  They come back, they kill people.
[02:08:39.516 --> 02:08:45.283]   And these law firms Don't sue Eric Holder or Obama.
[02:08:45.663 --> 02:08:48.124]  They sue Alex Jones.
[02:08:49.445 --> 02:08:51.326]  They sue Remington.
[02:08:53.207 --> 02:08:54.207]  So that doesn't make sense.
[02:08:54.248 --> 02:08:57.109]  When you get one of these rigged judges, they control everything that can be said?
[02:08:57.129 --> 02:08:58.290]  They tell the jury you're guilty?
[02:08:58.570 --> 02:08:58.990]  It happens.
[02:09:00.391 --> 02:09:04.533]  They're going to have Democrat-controlled jurisdictions, just like Yuvaldi.
[02:09:06.254 --> 02:09:08.035]  Tell that jury you're going to get $27 million.
[02:09:09.923 --> 02:09:16.128]  And they're going to use that $27 billion to take your guns with all these other lawyers who are suing all the gun manufacturers.
[02:09:17.969 --> 02:09:22.833]  Now you understand why we can't let a single one of the people under attack go down.
[02:09:24.955 --> 02:09:28.418]  And first and foremost amongst that is InfoWars.com.
[02:09:28.898 --> 02:09:34.222]  So buy a Remington 700 rifle to defend yourself and hunt deer.

[02:09:59.258 --> 02:10:08.326]  But I want to just spend a few minutes on this critical issue here, because I get asked this on the street, I get asked this by family, and I know I've been saying it maybe once a show the last few weeks.
[02:10:09.647 --> 02:10:11.128]  We're not going anywhere.
[02:10:11.148 --> 02:10:15.912]  We didn't file Chapter 11, we didn't chart Chapter 12, we didn't, we filed Chapter 5.
[02:10:17.822 --> 02:10:26.650]  Emergency reorganization, bankruptcy, so they would stop lying in state courts and saying we have $400 million, we have $160 million, we don't have $10 million.
[02:10:27.571 --> 02:10:40.784]  With all these fake judgments they're rigging, to just say, here's the real money in federal court, it'll all be adjudicated, it'll all be found, and then we can deal with that, because bankruptcy is designed to keep businesses going.
[02:10:41.877 --> 02:10:43.939]  When people want to destroy a business, which they've said.
[02:10:43.979 --> 02:10:45.160]  We want to shut Alex Jones down.
[02:10:45.521 --> 02:10:46.222]  We want to silence him.
[02:10:46.242 --> 02:10:47.042]  We want to take him off the air.
[02:10:47.443 --> 02:10:56.112]  As long in our 13-week plan that's already started, we're profitable and can show money that will be paid to these people.
[02:10:56.212 --> 02:10:56.753]  Who cares?
[02:10:58.217 --> 02:10:58.817]  It's not about money.
[02:10:59.878 --> 02:11:04.739]  Oh, so I won't get paid hardly anything, and whatever extra profit it is will go to these gun grabbers.
[02:11:04.799 --> 02:11:06.920]  I mean, it's a tax on truth.
[02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:11.921]  We will stay on air, which is their main goal, is to silence us, so it won't happen.
[02:11:13.062 --> 02:11:13.982]  So that's what's going on.
[02:11:14.002 --> 02:11:18.383]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.

[02:11:28.015 --> 02:11:29.835]  And they can't stand it.
[02:11:29.855 --> 02:11:31.796]  They're in these bankruptcy hearings, literally.
[02:11:32.256 --> 02:11:35.257]  George Soros law firms, Akin Gump, you name it.
[02:11:36.897 --> 02:11:38.657]  Going, Your Honor, we want it shut down.
[02:11:38.737 --> 02:11:39.657]  We want them closed.
[02:11:39.717 --> 02:11:42.218]  And the judge is like, well, federal law says you're a creditor.
[02:11:42.538 --> 02:11:44.998]  The judge has found Jones guilty, which is tyranny.
[02:11:45.659 --> 02:11:46.399]  But you want money?
[02:11:46.419 --> 02:11:47.559]  They're like, no, we don't want money.
[02:11:47.639 --> 02:11:49.419]  We want Jones silenced.
[02:11:49.459 --> 02:11:50.700]  We want to take him out.
[02:11:50.740 --> 02:11:51.760]  We want to de-platform him.
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:54.620]  We want to silence him as a message to everybody else.
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:56.941]  They've been very honest about it.
[02:11:59.136 --> 02:12:01.817]  And we didn't have products in supply chain breakdowns last year.
[02:12:02.097 --> 02:12:06.397]  It was just God's will that right as we did bankruptcy, all these products were coming back in.
[02:12:06.717 --> 02:12:08.878]  So now we're going to meet those goals if you just support us.
[02:12:10.218 --> 02:12:13.919]  Get Alex Jones' right t-shirt, get a book, get a film, mfulworthstore.com.
[02:12:14.979 --> 02:12:17.319]  And we'll just continue on and they'll be totally pissed.
[02:12:17.959 --> 02:12:21.080]  And of course, they're suing me personally and coming after my wealth.
[02:12:21.140 --> 02:12:23.580]  Well, under Texas law, I got a homestead, got a car.
[02:12:23.720 --> 02:12:24.881]  I don't care about money.
[02:12:25.141 --> 02:12:26.281]  You haven't figured it out.
[02:12:27.349 --> 02:12:31.813]  Your bosses tried to give me Glenn Beck's job before he was even hired.
[02:12:31.833 --> 02:12:33.914]  They tried to replace Rush Limbaugh with me.
[02:12:33.934 --> 02:12:37.998]  I mean, I had the talks with Fox News and Roger Ailes.
[02:12:39.279 --> 02:12:42.481]  15 years ago, 10 years ago, I was offered it all, dumbasses!
[02:12:43.823 --> 02:12:45.084]  I'll use money as a weapon.
[02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:52.530]  I don't mind a good steak or a nice car and a house that's okay, but I won't sell out nothing for even my life.
[02:12:54.019 --> 02:12:59.102]  They can put a gun to my head or my children and say, sell out to the New World Order, and I'll tell them, pull the trigger!
[02:13:00.723 --> 02:13:03.505]  And they can't stand the fact they can't buy me, and they can't buy you.
[02:13:03.565 --> 02:13:04.745]  So we need funds.

[02:13:54.563 --> 02:13:58.429]  What a broadcast with MTG and Drew Hernandez.

[02:14:44.118 --> 02:14:45.719]  This product is amazing.

[02:14:57.722 --> 02:14:58.262]  No, they're not.
[02:14:58.662 --> 02:15:07.847]  So if you haven't experienced DNA Force Plus yourself, or in the last year when it's been sold out you couldn't get it, it's finally back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:15:15.037 --> 02:15:16.437]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:16.477 --> 02:15:19.699]  I'm your guest host, Kate Dally from katedallyradio.com.
[02:15:19.739 --> 02:15:20.979]  So glad to be here with you today.
[02:15:20.999 --> 02:15:23.800]  And I have several things I want to talk about.
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:27.061]  Number one, student loan announcements just made.
[02:15:28.121 --> 02:15:36.304]  Number two, companies that are already starting to implement the Great Reset by stopping the production of diesel vehicles.
[02:15:37.290 --> 02:15:40.713]  And some climate change questions for you that are so obvious.
[02:15:41.394 --> 02:15:44.797]  Well, I know why they're not talked about in mainstream, of course.
[02:15:45.157 --> 02:15:46.579]  They can never point out the obvious.
[02:15:46.619 --> 02:15:48.921]  You have a bunch of talking heads with nice teeth and they can't do it.
[02:15:49.982 --> 02:15:51.964]  And I want to talk about a death.
[02:15:52.584 --> 02:15:53.284]  I know, a death.
[02:15:53.925 --> 02:15:55.605]  But there's a good message behind this.
[02:15:55.885 --> 02:15:57.486]  And so, let's get started, shall we?
[02:15:58.026 --> 02:16:08.850]  So, King Fraud-A-Lot just announced that certain Pell Grant users, meaning most of them, meaning all of them, are probably going to get their $20,000 knocked off their student loan.
[02:16:09.251 --> 02:16:09.551]  Okay?
[02:16:10.111 --> 02:16:13.732]  And if you didn't get Pell Grants, you're going to get $10,000 knocked off.
[02:16:14.072 --> 02:16:15.433]  You know, just because they love you.
[02:16:15.853 --> 02:16:16.053]  Right?
[02:16:16.533 --> 02:16:18.474]  And they're calling it student forgiveness.
[02:16:19.475 --> 02:16:20.275]  Student forgiveness.
[02:16:21.263 --> 02:16:23.023]  I find that word so odd.
[02:16:23.103 --> 02:16:24.424]  What in the hell is forgiveness?
[02:16:25.464 --> 02:16:28.325]  Forgiveness is what you get when you break your neighbor's window.
[02:16:28.345 --> 02:16:37.526]  It is not because you signed a contract to pay for something that you are receiving and then just decide that you don't want to pay.
[02:16:38.607 --> 02:16:39.967]  But I guess that's where we're going with this.
[02:16:40.587 --> 02:16:45.988]  So, free college here, free college there, so like Oprah, you get a free college, you get some free college.
[02:16:46.328 --> 02:16:47.469]  Everyone gets free college.
[02:16:48.729 --> 02:16:49.049]  Really?
[02:16:50.290 --> 02:16:50.650]  I don't know.
[02:16:51.410 --> 02:16:55.671]  I'm not quite sure why this is going on or why people aren't questioning the word forgiveness.
[02:16:55.991 --> 02:16:59.952]  But I saw it again even on local broadcasts, even in state news.
[02:17:01.012 --> 02:17:06.974]  The papers everybody relies on and trusts and thinks that they are not part of this big newspaper cabal.
[02:17:07.594 --> 02:17:11.074]  And so you signed up to pay a loan so you could go to college.
[02:17:11.935 --> 02:17:14.795]  But you get into college and you just don't want to pay for it.
[02:17:15.695 --> 02:17:21.156]   So why is every mainstream Why is every mainstream outlet calling it this?
[02:17:22.236 --> 02:17:26.517]  I mean, are they providing an apology for turning you into a liberal progressive?
[02:17:27.277 --> 02:17:30.818]  Are they providing an apology for not teaching you anything that matters?
[02:17:31.178 --> 02:17:32.939]  Is this where the word forgiveness comes from?
[02:17:33.579 --> 02:17:34.019]  I don't know.
[02:17:35.339 --> 02:17:38.020]  How does forgiveness become part of the equation all of a sudden?
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:39.820]  Why the word forgiveness?
[02:17:39.940 --> 02:17:41.521]  It's very, very strange, right?
[02:17:41.641 --> 02:17:46.962]  Are we forgiving your ability to, I don't know, exercise your signature on a contract?
[02:17:47.984 --> 02:17:49.786]  Are they going to start doing this with everything else?
[02:17:51.047 --> 02:17:57.052]  And then what happens to that very thing when we demean it so badly that we want to offer it for free?
[02:17:57.092 --> 02:17:58.333]  There is no such thing as free.
[02:17:59.194 --> 02:17:59.374]  Ever.
[02:17:59.634 --> 02:18:00.395]  And we all know this.
[02:18:01.376 --> 02:18:02.417]  Everybody's paying for this.
[02:18:03.635 --> 02:18:06.156]  Don't count on the journalists out there to educate anybody.
[02:18:06.336 --> 02:18:10.177]  They're just going to keep calling it free and they're going to keep calling it forgiveness for a reason.
[02:18:10.197 --> 02:18:12.838]  They don't want you to think it's anybody else's money.
[02:18:13.399 --> 02:18:17.500]  Chrisanne Hall, the constitutional expert who I've had on here before, said this.
[02:18:17.540 --> 02:18:22.262]  She said, you know, I've studied all through history, government all through history, thousands of years, right?
[02:18:22.702 --> 02:18:27.004]  And what grows the fastest and greatest through the mechanism of government generosity?
[02:18:27.464 --> 02:18:30.645]  Government generosity, generosity grows the most.
[02:18:31.285 --> 02:18:31.886]  I love that word.
[02:18:31.906 --> 02:18:32.846]  It's just like forgiveness.
[02:18:33.499 --> 02:18:33.739]  Really?
[02:18:34.260 --> 02:18:34.700]  It's bizarre.
[02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:41.264]  Anyway, this mechanism always operates by unjustly enriching some at the expense of others.
[02:18:41.584 --> 02:18:47.448]  It's also interesting to note that people don't generally get upset about this mechanism of government because they think it benefits them.
[02:18:47.528 --> 02:18:49.850]  They're getting a piece of the pie, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:18:49.890 --> 02:18:50.950]  They're getting some of the action.
[02:18:51.451 --> 02:18:54.933]  And whenever we get a personal piece of the action, we don't say much about it.
[02:18:55.613 --> 02:18:55.813]  Right?
[02:18:56.134 --> 02:18:56.654]  We let it go.
[02:18:57.475 --> 02:19:04.081]  People throughout history tend to get upset when government growth that unjustly enriches others at their expense, she says.
[02:19:04.301 --> 02:19:11.747]  How much simpler and juster government would it be if we understood that the government doesn't lawfully possess an authority to be generous to anyone?
[02:19:12.648 --> 02:19:14.049]  Government does not earn its own money.
[02:19:14.890 --> 02:19:16.531]  Government must take money to have money.
[02:19:17.432 --> 02:19:25.599]  Taking money from one person to another is always considered theft, regardless of who is doing the taking, even when it benefits you personally.
[02:19:26.314 --> 02:19:34.079]  For government to take and give away money, the people must authorize those in government the power to steal their money at will.
[02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:53.512]  This is the greatest expansion of power possible on this earth, and the authority to take from others, whatever, however, and whenever you want, for whatever reason you want, government generosity is sinful and tyrannical, and we must all refuse government generosity.
[02:19:54.278 --> 02:19:55.759]  It is other people's money.
[02:19:56.219 --> 02:20:02.483]  Whether you want to recognize that or not, the fact still remains, government has no money.
[02:20:03.163 --> 02:20:11.228]  Isn't it interesting that most of the, uh, from the election coup that happened, most in power have always worked with government.
[02:20:11.508 --> 02:20:15.070]  Biden has never really had a job outside of government, right?
[02:20:15.130 --> 02:20:18.332]  Bernie Sanders, never really a job outside of government.
[02:20:18.933 --> 02:20:21.054]  Always paid by your tax dollars.
[02:20:21.570 --> 02:20:25.393]  And might I add in large quantities coming out very rich.
[02:20:26.093 --> 02:20:26.414]  China.
[02:20:26.934 --> 02:20:27.634]  Just remember China.
[02:20:27.995 --> 02:20:30.797]  Anyway, so I wanted to mention this too.
[02:20:31.677 --> 02:20:36.241]  The bank will end loans in Australia for new gas and diesel cars.
[02:20:36.937 --> 02:20:40.180]  And buyers will only get loans for making the right decision.
[02:20:40.200 --> 02:20:41.862]  And this comes to us from Western Journal.
[02:20:41.882 --> 02:20:46.006]  This is really important because everybody's been talking about the ESG score.
[02:20:46.407 --> 02:20:56.117]  I remember talking about this five or six, seven years ago when we were outing a video about this that was going to soon turn into China's mechanism for lending money.
[02:20:56.217 --> 02:21:00.081]  You get this score, just like your credit score, but it's a government love score.
[02:21:00.781 --> 02:21:02.021]  And people didn't believe us.
[02:21:02.061 --> 02:21:03.202]  They thought we were wacko.
[02:21:03.222 --> 02:21:05.242]  They thought we were crazy for even bringing this up.
[02:21:05.262 --> 02:21:06.823]  That could never ever happen.
[02:21:07.243 --> 02:21:08.143]  Well, it is happening.
[02:21:08.603 --> 02:21:12.044]  In fact, a couple of months ago in the news, they said it was only developing in China.
[02:21:12.144 --> 02:21:12.845]  No, it's there.
[02:21:13.085 --> 02:21:13.965]  It's there in China.
[02:21:14.385 --> 02:21:18.906]  And so this ESG score, the initials stand for Environmental, Social and Governance.
[02:21:19.347 --> 02:21:25.669]  And the scores received, the scores that businesses receive can determine what they have access to in capital.
[02:21:25.709 --> 02:21:27.089]  This is what the Great Reset is.
[02:21:28.290 --> 02:21:31.051]  And Alex Jones, I'm pretty sure has a book on this subject.
[02:21:31.411 --> 02:21:37.454]  But what's interesting about the ESG score and what's scary about it is that it's already being implemented around the world.
[02:21:38.055 --> 02:21:43.638]  And everybody has some, you know, might have some different names for it, but here it's the ESG score.
[02:21:43.898 --> 02:22:01.669]   And so if you are not going to uphold the green agenda, the crazy green agenda, the Klaus Schwab's of the world that promised us we'll own nothing and be happy, The Green Agenda is all about, do you buy in as a company?
[02:22:02.229 --> 02:22:04.971]  And I don't think it's going to matter what the size of the company is.
[02:22:05.532 --> 02:22:23.583]  If you do not buy in to the LGBTQ trans, you know, pro trans, pro everything, change your business to meet these crazy new standards for that, and to also change up everything to be green, you just won't exist because you won't get money.
[02:22:24.338 --> 02:22:28.699]  It's like the worst fashion you could ever, ever even imagine, right?
[02:22:29.639 --> 02:22:48.444]  And so now, Australia comes out and they say, we think that the responsible thing for us to do next, well, I'm pretty sure it's just to get more money, is to ensure that our vehicle lending doesn't lock our customers into those bad, awful, high carbon emissions and increasingly expensive running costs in the years ahead.
[02:22:48.464 --> 02:22:51.665]  Oh, Australia Bank, you're so amazing.
[02:22:52.546 --> 02:23:01.857]  And of course, there's the Bank of Australia's Chief Impact Officer, that is actually a real name, not a Babylon Bee, or the Onion.
[02:23:02.257 --> 02:23:10.087]  And they basically said this, our announcement today is the beginning of a conversation with our customers and a signal to the wider market.
[02:23:10.387 --> 02:23:19.273]  That if you're considering buying a new car, you should think seriously about an electric vehicle, both for its impact on climate and its lifetime cost savings.
[02:23:19.533 --> 02:23:21.274]  Don't look at the sticker shock.
[02:23:21.715 --> 02:23:25.017]  Don't look at the $60,000 you're going to pay.
[02:23:25.037 --> 02:23:25.077]  No!
[02:23:25.817 --> 02:23:27.638]  Just look at the impact on climate.
[02:23:28.319 --> 02:23:28.979]  What impact?
[02:23:30.020 --> 02:23:31.421]  Can you identify the impact?
[02:23:36.223 --> 02:23:37.083]  I don't think you can.
[02:23:37.283 --> 02:23:39.664]  And I'm sorry, what conversation with the customers?
[02:23:39.904 --> 02:23:41.345]  What customers are you talking to?
[02:23:41.365 --> 02:23:45.426]  I don't ever remember having conversations like this with my own bank.
[02:23:46.566 --> 02:23:48.107]  And a signal to the wider market?
[02:23:48.327 --> 02:23:57.770]  No, you're signaling the powers that be to get some funding for your bank to make sure that you stay afloat as we progress into the Great Reset.
[02:23:57.870 --> 02:23:58.890]  That's what it's all about.
[02:23:59.070 --> 02:24:00.011]  And now it's starting.
[02:24:01.650 --> 02:24:15.716]  Now they're warning and telling you, and I think that American companies are coming next into this fray, to tell you that for your own good, for the responsible decision, you're basically a nitwit that can't choose which car to own.
[02:24:15.976 --> 02:24:17.236]  So we're going to choose for you.
[02:24:17.636 --> 02:24:23.799]  And we're going to make sure that it isn't, you know, that awful gas, awful diesel, how horrible.
[02:24:23.819 --> 02:24:28.941]  They're so benevolent and so trying to help us make decisions.
[02:24:30.248 --> 02:24:32.430]  No, they are just part of the Great Reset.
[02:24:32.570 --> 02:24:33.551]  It's plain and simple.
[02:24:33.831 --> 02:24:34.752]  And this is starting.
[02:24:34.872 --> 02:24:36.153]  So what are you going to do?
[02:24:36.353 --> 02:24:37.574]  What are we going to do?
[02:24:38.034 --> 02:24:40.976]  What plans do you have to circumvent this?
[02:24:41.437 --> 02:24:45.019]  How are you going to be able to make decisions in the future?
[02:24:45.240 --> 02:24:48.382]  Companies just will not be shored up with funding and they will die.
[02:24:48.522 --> 02:24:52.805]  The ones that do not complement or go all in on the Great Reset.
[02:24:53.126 --> 02:24:54.607]  That's what's so scary about this.
[02:24:55.273 --> 02:25:01.296]  We don't realize that the impact of what they're doing, not the impact on the environment, is what is going to harm us.
[02:25:01.976 --> 02:25:02.677]  I'll be right back.
[02:25:02.697 --> 02:25:04.598]  I'm your guest host for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:04.958 --> 02:25:06.959]  I'm Kate Dally, katedallyradio.com.
[02:25:07.179 --> 02:25:08.019]  Be right back.
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:10.441]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:10.481 --> 02:25:13.222]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:25:14.184 --> 02:25:36.082]  Talking about ESG, I don't know if people were noticing back in 2020 when they were just trying to survive with their businesses and we had the havoc of a huge lie told to us to keep our nation locked down and non-functioning, that new articles were coming out about this new ESG practice in China and its implications in foreign affairs.
[02:25:36.282 --> 02:25:38.084]  Georgetown even wrote a piece on this.
[02:25:38.684 --> 02:25:44.008]  Back in 2020, telling us it was coming and also telling us that it had the potential.
[02:25:44.529 --> 02:25:47.631]  It had the potential to be a tool for Chinese foreign policy.
[02:25:47.651 --> 02:25:54.837]  They just really didn't want to talk about the fact that it was already coming here, that it was already being implemented.
[02:25:55.658 --> 02:25:57.079]  And there were strings attached.
[02:25:57.339 --> 02:26:04.945]  More government money to those companies who play along and just go along with this whole nightmare, right?
[02:26:05.692 --> 02:26:16.139]  And so they had the ESG regulations globally increasing tenfold after over the last 15 years without us really realizing it.
[02:26:16.559 --> 02:26:17.679]  The messaging was out there.
[02:26:17.700 --> 02:26:24.744]  Everything was out there, but they weren't really implementing, implementing until now and until the last couple of years.
[02:26:25.244 --> 02:26:34.390]  And so what they were basically talking about was China's Securities Regulatory Commission in collaboration with their Ministry of Environmental Protection.
[02:26:35.509 --> 02:26:37.950]  And they introduced all these new requirements.
[02:26:38.010 --> 02:26:47.373]  And by the end of 2020, they were going to mandate all listed companies to disclose their ESG risks associated with their operations.
[02:26:47.893 --> 02:26:52.095]  So you get money, you get money if you disclose what you are doing.
[02:26:52.535 --> 02:26:56.957]  And so that way they could keep track of exactly what you're doing to penalize you.
[02:26:58.197 --> 02:27:02.519]  And so were they serious about instilling all these new ESG regulations?
[02:27:02.559 --> 02:27:03.179]  Of course they were.
[02:27:04.420 --> 02:27:07.243]  And then they said that we all had to meet a global standard.
[02:27:07.524 --> 02:27:09.206]  And this is how it sort of rolled out.
[02:27:09.966 --> 02:27:16.073]  Their move from a voluntary disclosure regime to mandatory one started to happen.
[02:27:16.494 --> 02:27:20.498]  And, of course, this is going on in all different nations too.
[02:27:20.618 --> 02:27:22.180]  France, everywhere else, right?
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:22.701]  Australia.
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:35.247]  And so all these large firms, public interest firms, they had to start disclosing environmental, social, and employee-related matters such as anti-bribery, corruption, and human rights performance.
[02:27:36.047 --> 02:27:46.613]  Those are all lovely words that sound really nice to somebody without a brain cell, but what it really was about their version of human rights is the green agenda.
[02:27:47.394 --> 02:27:50.275]  How is that, you know, going to affect everybody?
[02:27:50.355 --> 02:27:53.057]  So the human rights is really, how green are you?
[02:27:53.977 --> 02:27:56.559]  Um, because that is their version of rights.
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:28:08.590]  And so, of course, we started doing this in the UK, um, and the actual disclosing actual greenhouse gas emissions and diversity and human rights, whatever, under the Companies Act of 2006.
[02:28:09.050 --> 02:28:16.577]  And in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission required all listed firms to disclose their environmental compliance.
[02:28:17.546 --> 02:28:18.526]  Papers, please.
[02:28:18.806 --> 02:28:19.927]  You will comply.
[02:28:20.607 --> 02:28:22.507]  So the compliance expenses.
[02:28:22.707 --> 02:28:31.650]  So moreover, there's this new movement towards increasing ESG requirements in the SEC's mandatory integrated disclosure regime.
[02:28:32.030 --> 02:28:35.051]  So voluntary to mandatory, which it always is.
[02:28:35.371 --> 02:28:37.131]  They always introduce it as voluntary.
[02:28:37.151 --> 02:28:39.552]  It doesn't matter what we're talking about, sadly.
[02:28:40.052 --> 02:28:46.574]  And so they started talking about it overseas, the Asia Pacific markets, and then it gets to where we're at.
[02:28:47.308 --> 02:28:54.873]  And of course, they talk about the fact that reporting is voluntary in Australia and Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong.
[02:28:55.733 --> 02:28:59.095]  Reporting obligation is on to comply or explain.
[02:28:59.515 --> 02:29:01.377]  You get to explain why you're not complying.
[02:29:01.677 --> 02:29:02.697]  Sure, that goes over well.
[02:29:02.717 --> 02:29:07.000]  Do you just disappear in China if you try to explain and not comply?
[02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:07.500]  Hmm.
[02:29:08.081 --> 02:29:15.005]  Anyway, across the regions, China being no exception, led to an increase in the volume of ESG disclosures.
[02:29:15.465 --> 02:29:16.066]  Because why?
[02:29:16.126 --> 02:29:18.687]  Because companies want money and they want favors from government.
[02:29:19.508 --> 02:29:29.855]  And this is how you know back in the day, back in the blovid COVID era, a couple of years ago, all the companies were going all in, right?
[02:29:30.175 --> 02:29:38.781]  The signage, the ridiculous rules, the masked Nazis, everybody was running around showing how compliant they truly are.
[02:29:39.261 --> 02:29:40.042]  So disgusting.
[02:29:40.760 --> 02:29:46.349]  Anyway, so China, the top manufacturing location for 500 firms.
[02:29:46.970 --> 02:29:47.872]  Isn't that convenient?
[02:29:49.492 --> 02:29:51.673]  It makes their performance critical, right?
[02:29:51.913 --> 02:29:54.954]  So, of course, they're going to bow down to China.
[02:29:55.234 --> 02:29:56.435]  We're bowing down to China.
[02:29:56.835 --> 02:29:56.995]  Right?
[02:29:57.255 --> 02:29:57.755]  Right, Hunter?
[02:29:58.035 --> 02:29:58.435]  Right, Biden?
[02:29:58.715 --> 02:29:58.896]  Right?
[02:29:59.096 --> 02:29:59.696]  Being proud a lot?
[02:29:59.816 --> 02:30:00.716]  Yeah.
[02:30:00.796 --> 02:30:01.737]  We're bowing to them.
[02:30:01.837 --> 02:30:02.777]  Very subservient.
[02:30:03.217 --> 02:30:06.018]  And so this, of course, is the new thing.
[02:30:06.478 --> 02:30:15.961]  I also recognize that back in 2020, they also said five-year plan approved by the fourth session of their 12th National People's Congress in China in March of 2016.
[02:30:17.862 --> 02:30:23.645]  And it links the 2030 agenda with domestic mid-long-term development strategies, right?
[02:30:24.085 --> 02:30:26.706]  Why is it it's always a five-year plan?
[02:30:27.507 --> 02:30:39.352]  You know, check your city and your county for their new developing five-year plans because they seem to be in love with the communist idea that everything needs a five-year plan, passing budgets every year.
[02:30:39.392 --> 02:30:42.294]  And you'll notice this in cities and counties across America right now.
[02:30:43.034 --> 02:30:46.976]  What they do is they implement five-year plans to gouge you for them right now.
[02:30:47.854 --> 02:30:53.077]  And how they do that is they say, well, we need, we need, we need could be a recession coming.
[02:30:53.117 --> 02:30:58.480]  So we need these five-year plans to tax you now so that we have things later when we need them.
[02:30:59.181 --> 02:31:01.782]  You know, when you're passing budgets every year, you don't need to do that.
[02:31:02.122 --> 02:31:16.110]  Did you know that you simply don't need to do it, but they're going to con you into thinking that five-year plans are just the best thing since sliced bread and five-year plans are the agenda agenda for everything.
[02:31:16.250 --> 02:31:17.331]  It's coming up in everything.
[02:31:18.041 --> 02:31:26.747]  So, as we're walking into this new era of ESG compliance, it takes businesses complying, right?
[02:31:26.807 --> 02:31:29.308]  Because there's not enough minions to run these things.
[02:31:29.688 --> 02:31:32.190]  The people that think of these things can't do it alone.
[02:31:32.310 --> 02:31:34.651]  They just need compliant companies.
[02:31:35.452 --> 02:31:36.593]  And why are they doing it?
[02:31:37.353 --> 02:31:38.614]  Well, the Green Movement.
[02:31:39.281 --> 02:31:41.323]  I'd like to ask you a few questions about that.
[02:31:41.403 --> 02:31:52.493]  Do you know there's one question that climate enthusiasts, I'll just call them that, boneheads, but enthusiasts, we'll go with climate enthusiasts, seem to never be able to answer?
[02:31:53.474 --> 02:32:00.040]  One single question that honestly draws a blink and draws a face like this.
[02:32:01.201 --> 02:32:02.482]  Seriously, I'm not joking.
[02:32:03.703 --> 02:32:12.311]   And the question is, Over the last 60, 70 years that we've been talking about this, how has climate change affected you?
[02:32:13.452 --> 02:32:17.998]  You'll never see anyone, I'm not joking, in mainstream media ever ask this question.
[02:32:19.120 --> 02:32:24.106]  How has human-caused climate change affected your life?
[02:32:25.000 --> 02:32:26.501]  And can you give it to me in details?
[02:32:26.581 --> 02:32:29.544]  Because I'm sure after this entire time, right?
[02:32:29.904 --> 02:32:32.846]  We went through the 70s where we were all going to be popsicles.
[02:32:33.247 --> 02:32:40.152]  We went to 2013, promised by Al Gore, even won the Nobel Prize, that we were going to be fried eggs on the sidewalk.
[02:32:41.173 --> 02:32:45.356]  How actually has climate change really affected your life?
[02:32:46.577 --> 02:32:48.299]  Look back at your last 40, 30, 40, 50, 60 years.
[02:32:48.319 --> 02:32:49.800]  How have you been impacted?
[02:32:54.039 --> 02:32:55.840]  By human-caused climate change.
[02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:57.741]  Most people can't answer this.
[02:32:58.321 --> 02:32:59.301]  No one can answer this.
[02:32:59.781 --> 02:33:00.282]  Why is that?
[02:33:01.202 --> 02:33:02.162]  Because there is no answer.
[02:33:03.063 --> 02:33:04.463]  There is literally no answer.
[02:33:04.924 --> 02:33:06.744]  Your lives haven't been changed or altered.
[02:33:07.665 --> 02:33:12.627]  Do you remember the gal in the 90s who was spewing climate change and she was going to be dead by the end of the decade?
[02:33:13.527 --> 02:33:17.749]  Yeah, she went on to get married and have a couple kids that are pretty much grown now.
[02:33:18.449 --> 02:33:18.629]  Hmm.
[02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:20.050]  How does that happen?
[02:33:20.762 --> 02:33:21.282]  How does that happen?
[02:33:21.302 --> 02:33:22.362]  I thought the world was going to end.
[02:33:22.663 --> 02:33:23.383]  We were promised.
[02:33:23.503 --> 02:33:24.963]  She was screaming from the pulpit.
[02:33:25.503 --> 02:33:28.084]  She just ended up being, what, some ambassador's daughter?
[02:33:28.104 --> 02:33:31.605]  That they got to come in and scream about climate change?
[02:33:31.645 --> 02:33:33.166]  She was the pre-Greta version.
[02:33:33.546 --> 02:33:36.887]  Yeah, the free zombie, the pre-zombie version.
[02:33:37.447 --> 02:33:39.247]  Anyway, she went on to have a family.
[02:33:39.307 --> 02:33:42.068]  You don't really hear her spouting that the world's going to end anytime soon.
[02:33:42.808 --> 02:33:42.968]  Nope.
[02:33:43.749 --> 02:33:45.669]  And none of you have been affected by climate change.
[02:33:45.849 --> 02:33:48.130]  Human-caused climate change, because it's just cyclical.
[02:33:48.760 --> 02:33:49.320]  I'll be right back.
[02:33:49.340 --> 02:33:50.500]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[02:33:50.820 --> 02:33:52.601]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:52.661 --> 02:33:54.101]  So glad to be a part of your day today.
[02:33:54.541 --> 02:34:01.223]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host, and you know, I don't mind talking about this subject because it's such a boneheaded subject.
[02:34:01.583 --> 02:34:11.065]  I hate to be mean, but if you still believe in this 60 years later, and I always say, you know, you have your climate theorists, okay?
[02:34:11.245 --> 02:34:13.325]  That is a true theory.
[02:34:13.465 --> 02:34:14.986]  They believe a theory.
[02:34:15.006 --> 02:34:22.343]   Now, to be fair, they could say I think the Federal Reserve is going to go belly up.
[02:34:22.663 --> 02:34:24.985]  I think our currency is over.
[02:34:25.005 --> 02:34:28.667]  I think that government is trying to control and take liberty.
[02:34:29.508 --> 02:34:32.910]  Now, which one of us truly has history backing us up?
[02:34:34.632 --> 02:34:35.332]  I'm going to go with me.
[02:34:35.352 --> 02:34:36.693]  I'm going to go with me.
[02:34:37.474 --> 02:34:39.275]  I actually have history backing me up.
[02:34:39.775 --> 02:34:41.336]  Because what is government capable of?
[02:34:41.516 --> 02:34:42.277]  Only one thing.
[02:34:43.017 --> 02:34:48.190]   They can only move forward to strip your liberty and to do it Under lies.
[02:34:48.630 --> 02:34:50.351]  That's what they've always done for centuries.
[02:34:50.571 --> 02:34:54.214]  And when I study history, this is what you see.
[02:34:55.175 --> 02:35:04.122]  Climate theorists, so coincidence theorists and climate theorists believe that the world is going to end for 60 years.
[02:35:05.283 --> 02:35:09.546]  Now, climate change is always put out 10 years ahead.
[02:35:09.826 --> 02:35:10.367]  Why is that?
[02:35:10.727 --> 02:35:15.531]  Well, if they did 20 years, you wouldn't pay any attention and it wouldn't catch your immediate focus.
[02:35:15.891 --> 02:35:16.711]  Okay?
[02:35:16.731 --> 02:35:17.352]  20 years is too long.
[02:35:17.984 --> 02:35:24.809]  But if you make it 10 years, that at the beginning of every decade, you're going to die at the end of every decade, conveniently.
[02:35:25.229 --> 02:35:26.130]  And then we start again.
[02:35:26.490 --> 02:35:27.271]  We start anew.
[02:35:28.171 --> 02:35:39.980]  So in the 60s, in the 70s, Life Magazine, Time Magazine was promising us that we were going to be doomed and turned into icicles in the biggest freeze to ever hit mankind by 1979.
[02:35:42.145 --> 02:35:42.725]  Did it happen?
[02:35:43.006 --> 02:35:43.186]  No.
[02:35:43.786 --> 02:35:46.848]  And then in the 80s, the warming started again with gore.
[02:35:47.428 --> 02:35:49.549]  And I'll talk about that for just a moment.
[02:35:49.689 --> 02:35:52.731]  So in 1970, Earth Day, right?
[02:35:53.011 --> 02:35:55.333]  Earth Day had its big debut.
[02:35:55.433 --> 02:36:01.997]   And of course, New York Times had a huge article about this and it was like, oh, The Earth, the Earth, the Earth, the Mother Earth.
[02:36:02.357 --> 02:36:03.558]  We should all worship the Earth.
[02:36:03.618 --> 02:36:05.139]  Forget about God, just worship the Earth.
[02:36:05.759 --> 02:36:12.203]  And they also played the Indian crying commercials, and all of a sudden everybody was polluting everywhere.
[02:36:12.744 --> 02:36:19.128]  Now as you were probably driving around, if you were alive in this era, you were driving around and noticing that no, not everybody was polluting everything.
[02:36:19.608 --> 02:36:27.434]  But they wanted you to think that every body of water was now becoming extinct and that we were just trashing the place all of the sudden.
[02:36:27.914 --> 02:36:43.466]  After years of never mentioning this at all, we get to the 1970s and we have the crying Indian who wasn't even an Indian, he was actually Italian, dressed up with a feather in his head to tell us that we were ruining every lake and every body of water and every piece of land in America.
[02:36:44.153 --> 02:36:59.122]  And of course, the EPA got rolling 10,000 employees overnight and all of a sudden we had a huge agency to then go into the 70s to hide what was also considered the oil shortage at the time, which wasn't actually going on.
[02:36:59.182 --> 02:37:10.589]  We have plenty of reserves here, but they wanted it to look like the world was being upended by everything environmental that had to do with gas and oil, everything else, right?
[02:37:11.009 --> 02:37:13.571]  And this is what started this whole nonsense.
[02:37:13.991 --> 02:37:17.232]  But let me bring you back, because I like to go back in history and look at headlines a little bit.
[02:37:17.612 --> 02:37:26.874]  The Harvard biologist George Wald estimated that civilization would end by 1985 or 2000 unless immediate action was taken against problems facing mankind.
[02:37:27.474 --> 02:37:30.295]  And so people heard this over and over and over again.
[02:37:30.475 --> 02:37:37.917]  Paul Ehrlich said population will inevitably and completely outstrip whatever small increases in food supplies we make.
[02:37:38.433 --> 02:37:44.318]  And the death rate will increase until at least 100 or 2 million people per year will be starving to death by 1980.
[02:37:45.399 --> 02:37:48.962]  And it was all due to human-caused climate change.
[02:37:49.663 --> 02:37:49.923]  Wow.
[02:37:50.464 --> 02:37:51.725]  That's amazing, isn't it?
[02:37:52.165 --> 02:37:53.947]  All due to human-caused climate change.
[02:37:54.841 --> 02:38:01.067]  And most of the people who are going to die in the greatest cataclysm in history of man have already been born.
[02:38:01.087 --> 02:38:02.849]  And this was by 1975.
[02:38:03.530 --> 02:38:11.298]  Paul Ehrlich said food shortages will have escalated the present level of world hunger and starvation to famines of unbelievable proportions.
[02:38:11.798 --> 02:38:20.305]  The only thing affecting our food supply is a manufactured crisis that they are doing themselves in government, not because of climate change.
[02:38:20.725 --> 02:38:26.850]  Yet we were promised from early on, from the 1960s on, that we would die of these things.
[02:38:27.290 --> 02:38:34.396]  Paul Ehrlich also predicted in 1970 that air pollution is certainly going to take hundreds of thousands of lives in the next year alone.
[02:38:35.357 --> 02:38:43.567]   Pollution cannot make a dent in climate change, just like it cannot change The sun coming up tomorrow, there is no way to do that at all.
[02:38:44.147 --> 02:38:45.969]  In fact, it's completely bogus.
[02:38:46.869 --> 02:38:56.537]  You can take companies that offer up their level of pollution and do what you want to those certain companies, but it has nothing to do with cyclical climate change.
[02:38:57.458 --> 02:39:01.841]  That is 400 cycles, 800-year cycles, and 1,000-year cycles.
[02:39:02.021 --> 02:39:04.083]  You can't do anything about it, right?
[02:39:04.733 --> 02:39:15.750]  And so, of course, ecologist Kenneth Watt declared back in the day, in the 70s, by the year 2000, we will be using up crude oil at such a rate there won't be any more crude oil left.
[02:39:16.940 --> 02:39:19.801]  Sure glad God made a really great world that renews itself.
[02:39:20.102 --> 02:39:22.603]  Anyway, they do the same thing with water, too.
[02:39:23.023 --> 02:39:38.510]  They treat it as if you can't get water out of the ground like they did for civilizations, but it can only come from snowpack and rain, and it can only come from government, because government now handles all your utilities and water, don't they?
[02:39:38.931 --> 02:39:39.971]  We've gotten used to it.
[02:39:40.671 --> 02:39:42.452]  It didn't always used to be like that.
[02:39:42.952 --> 02:39:46.054]  We used to actually go down for primary water where it's very renewable.
[02:39:47.159 --> 02:40:04.496]  So all of these lies, Gore was even elected in the 80s because of these lies, because he listened to a German Nazi scientist's theory, wasn't even fact, and the guy even said it wasn't a fact, Hans Suess, a German scientist, that said that we could be warming.
[02:40:05.359 --> 02:40:06.079]  So what did he do?
[02:40:06.460 --> 02:40:18.387]  He rode that lie all the way in to his cash cow and became a person in government, paid by our government, making millions off of our government for decades.
[02:40:18.447 --> 02:40:23.170]  And he's still around with the same old boring story that we're all going to shrivel up from the heat.
[02:40:24.010 --> 02:40:25.611]  So why does this happen?
[02:40:25.731 --> 02:40:26.512]  How does this happen?
[02:40:27.225 --> 02:40:34.547]  Well, let me give you just a little snapshot of history for just one moment because I'm going to ask the very obvious questions.
[02:40:34.587 --> 02:40:38.688]  And you might want to bring this up to the climate enthusiasts that you probably have in your family.
[02:40:39.268 --> 02:40:40.288]  Everybody does, okay?
[02:40:41.088 --> 02:40:44.649]  We've been told for 20 or more years that ice was disappearing.
[02:40:45.929 --> 02:40:47.370]  So why hasn't it all disappeared yet?
[02:40:48.210 --> 02:40:49.890]  It must be on a very slow burn.
[02:40:50.430 --> 02:40:52.491]  So we still have lots of ice.
[02:40:53.171 --> 02:40:53.651]  What's the deal?
[02:40:54.502 --> 02:40:58.746]  They can't just keep up the headline that it's disappearing for 20 years, can they?
[02:40:59.707 --> 02:41:00.688]  Do you want the answer to that?
[02:41:01.348 --> 02:41:02.209]  Yes, they can!
[02:41:02.670 --> 02:41:08.775]  And they do it with a smile, and they do it because they think we're that stupid that we won't recognize that it's actually never gone.
[02:41:09.916 --> 02:41:11.217]  Same thing with the polar bears.
[02:41:11.358 --> 02:41:16.442]  They show a sick polar bear on the cover of Time, and they say, oh my gosh, all the polar bears are sick.
[02:41:17.383 --> 02:41:18.624]  Nobody knew he was diseased.
[02:41:19.225 --> 02:41:20.286]  That finally came out later.
[02:41:21.383 --> 02:41:26.947]  But if the polar bears are dying off for 20 years, well, why aren't they all dead?
[02:41:27.908 --> 02:41:28.748]  Why are they all buried?
[02:41:29.689 --> 02:41:30.669]  There should be none left.
[02:41:32.351 --> 02:41:38.094]  But they think we're so stupid that we'll still believe the articles that say the polar bears are still dying.
[02:41:38.735 --> 02:41:50.383]  For 20 years of his career, Leonardo DiCaprio, DiCraprio, has said that the polar bears were dying and the ice is disappearing as he flies his little fancy jet all over the world.
[02:41:51.237 --> 02:41:52.217]  That's so interesting.
[02:41:52.237 --> 02:41:53.918]  20 years of this?
[02:41:54.298 --> 02:41:54.878]  Leonardo?
[02:41:55.098 --> 02:41:55.398]  Really?
[02:41:56.198 --> 02:41:58.879]  How do you still stand there and say it with a straight face?
[02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:01.760]  They're not buried everywhere.
[02:42:01.780 --> 02:42:06.962]  We're not seeing carcasses of polar bears and only one left, are we?
[02:42:06.982 --> 02:42:10.363]  I mean, come on, how many times can you tell this lie?
[02:42:11.323 --> 02:42:11.623]  Right?
[02:42:13.003 --> 02:42:14.364]  Can we ever look at the obvious?
[02:42:14.604 --> 02:42:18.065]  Can we ever look that these theories came from the Nazi scientists?
[02:42:19.571 --> 02:42:22.312]  Hmm, that we brought over an Operation Paperclip?
[02:42:22.512 --> 02:42:24.953]  Why in the world do we not talk about this more?
[02:42:25.793 --> 02:42:31.515]  Al Gore claimed his stake in the Senate solely on this garbage of lies.
[02:42:31.935 --> 02:42:33.356]  Why hasn't he ever called out on it?
[02:42:33.576 --> 02:42:35.816]  In fact, he's not called out on it and he gets the Nobel Prize.
[02:42:37.877 --> 02:42:38.677]  Good grief.
[02:42:39.558 --> 02:42:43.799]  And you know what I said before as I went out of break last time?
[02:42:43.939 --> 02:42:48.872]   Look, you can't ask somebody What, how has climate change affected you?
[02:42:49.132 --> 02:42:50.213]  Because it hasn't!
[02:42:51.533 --> 02:43:00.875]  If climate change were a thing, you would have seen in your life, think back on all the memories of your life, you would have been impacted by it somehow.
[02:43:01.655 --> 02:43:02.635]  You never were.
[02:43:03.315 --> 02:43:06.396]  It's the biggest farce, the biggest lie that they've told.
[02:43:06.536 --> 02:43:11.397]  And I agree with billionaire Dan Pena when he says anything we do isn't a fart in the wind.
[02:43:11.417 --> 02:43:12.857]  It can't be.
[02:43:14.108 --> 02:43:21.392]  You can't affect anything that happens on a cyclical nature, just like you can't affect fall coming in later than usual.
[02:43:21.953 --> 02:43:22.753]  It's cyclical.
[02:43:23.414 --> 02:43:25.495]  And I went back into history and I proved it.
[02:43:25.755 --> 02:43:27.036]  I saw it for myself.
[02:43:27.316 --> 02:43:30.038]  All the times we had droughts, all the times we had famines, all the different times.
[02:43:30.058 --> 02:43:30.698]  It's cyclical.
[02:43:30.838 --> 02:43:31.639]  I'll be right back.
[02:43:31.699 --> 02:43:34.600]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:35.061 --> 02:43:36.442]  Thanks for watching the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:36.462 --> 02:43:39.203]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from katedalyradio.com.
[02:43:39.243 --> 02:43:40.244]  Happy to be with you today.
[02:43:41.149 --> 02:43:45.472]  Somebody died in June and it went completely unrecognized.
[02:43:46.573 --> 02:43:47.174]  He was a boy.
[02:43:47.194 --> 02:43:50.616]  He was 14 years old, but he wasn't an ordinary boy.
[02:43:50.636 --> 02:43:53.078]  And I want to tell you why I'm talking about this today.
[02:43:53.098 --> 02:43:53.839]  It's important.
[02:43:54.579 --> 02:43:55.500]  He was homeschooled.
[02:43:55.960 --> 02:43:59.303]  He was taken out of the system so he could flourish.
[02:44:00.303 --> 02:44:04.587]  And he took care of his disabled parents and his autistic older brother.
[02:44:06.468 --> 02:44:08.870]  And he even wrote an autobiography.
[02:44:10.186 --> 02:44:11.447]  Don't tell me I can't.
[02:44:12.407 --> 02:44:13.748]  Don't tell me I can't.
[02:44:14.448 --> 02:44:16.950]  And it was written by his pen name, Cole Summers.
[02:44:17.770 --> 02:44:19.431]  He was actually named Kevin Cooper.
[02:44:21.212 --> 02:44:23.894]  Kevin called this his first me do it moment.
[02:44:24.914 --> 02:44:29.036]  He was four years old the first time he helped take apart an engine and rebuild it.
[02:44:29.316 --> 02:44:35.260]  Before that, he was helping changing tires and taking off the lug nuts at age three.
[02:44:36.941 --> 02:44:41.421]   He treasured trying to learn From men in their 90s.
[02:44:42.382 --> 02:44:47.243]  He loved older folks and he thought that learning from his own experience was nonsense.
[02:44:47.283 --> 02:44:49.983]  He says, it takes too long and you screw up too much.
[02:44:51.303 --> 02:44:57.365]  And he also said, I wanted to figure out what everybody else already learned so I could get a good head start.
[02:44:59.065 --> 02:45:04.046]  After a Cub Scout trip to a senior care center, he came home and complained to his mom.
[02:45:04.606 --> 02:45:06.487]  All I did was stand there and sing.
[02:45:06.547 --> 02:45:08.307]  I didn't even get to interact with anybody.
[02:45:10.182 --> 02:45:12.063]  What 14-year-old kid says that?
[02:45:14.263 --> 02:45:16.584]  Kevin was more than simply homeschooled.
[02:45:16.904 --> 02:45:21.945]  He was part of a movement called unschooling, where the kid is allowed to design the curriculum.
[02:45:22.425 --> 02:45:28.167]  And in the beginning, the Coopers were happy to homeschool using a standard curriculum.
[02:45:29.147 --> 02:45:30.988]  And they both were supervising, of course.
[02:45:31.448 --> 02:45:41.960]   But the standard curriculum became completely irrelevant When at six years old, Kevin discovered the instructional videos of billionaire investor Warren Buffett.
[02:45:42.941 --> 02:45:49.927]  And as he told the story in his memoir, he asked his dad at six, how do people make money?
[02:45:49.967 --> 02:45:50.668]  How do they get rich?
[02:45:51.909 --> 02:45:55.712]  He was more than just simply homeschooled though, right?
[02:45:56.432 --> 02:46:01.076]  His book that he lived and died by was the Poor Charlie's Almanac.
[02:46:02.618 --> 02:46:08.161]   And of course, Billy and Tina broke the bank in order for him to buy it.
[02:46:08.401 --> 02:46:16.185]  And at age eight, after a few years of packaged homeschool curriculums, Kevin asked his parents if he could design his own lessons.
[02:46:16.625 --> 02:46:19.326]  So seeing no harm in the experiment, they agreed.
[02:46:19.426 --> 02:46:23.228]  His focus was always on business, called it an entrepreneurial unschooling.
[02:46:23.888 --> 02:46:32.673]  And when friends told him they were memorizing the state capitals or the names of rocks, Kevin would try to interest them in corporate tax law or the principles of wealth building.
[02:46:34.073 --> 02:46:43.441]  And he launched his business empire at the age of seven by selling rabbits for meat and his parents fronted him the first five rabbits and helped him remodel the old barn.
[02:46:44.702 --> 02:46:53.549]  And soon, according to their account, Kevin was selling his rabbits to restaurants in California using a traveling broker to deliver them.
[02:46:54.238 --> 02:47:04.020]  And his parents still aren't sure how he figured all of that out, but by the time he even turned eight, he had formed a limited liability company, an LLC, that was bringing in more than $1,000 a month.
[02:47:04.640 --> 02:47:17.403]  With his parents okay, he used the funds from a loan and an insurance settlement related to the rabbits to buy 350 acres of fallow land near his home for $130 an acre when he was nine years old.
[02:47:18.503 --> 02:47:21.504]  And then, of course, he went into regenerative agriculture.
[02:47:22.441 --> 02:47:28.124]  At times, Kevin's life resembled a party game where someone starts with a paperclip and keeps trading up.
[02:47:28.364 --> 02:47:28.984]  You've heard of that?
[02:47:29.665 --> 02:47:35.988]  The proceeds from his seven-year-old rabbit venture led to the nine-year-old's purchase of the $350 acre ranch.
[02:47:36.828 --> 02:47:42.571]  And then he discovered a wealth of information in county property and tax records, including the concept of lawyer's liens.
[02:47:43.831 --> 02:47:44.952]  Yeah, he's eight years old.
[02:47:45.712 --> 02:47:49.894]  Lawyer who is owed money from a client can put a lien on a client's property.
[02:47:50.175 --> 02:47:51.015]  He figured this out.
[02:47:51.963 --> 02:47:58.246]  And of course he found such a situation, lawyer had totally forgotten about it, offered him half and bought it.
[02:47:58.427 --> 02:48:02.689]  He actually doubled his money when the property sold within a few weeks.
[02:48:03.529 --> 02:48:12.794]  His next purchase was 20 acres of land for $100 an acre where a woman just had simply no interest in paying the taxes on her late husband's little piece of land that he would camp on.
[02:48:13.375 --> 02:48:23.351]   So he turned the $2,000 investment into a $20,000 trade with a well Who Kevin described as a skinny cowboy with a big handlebar mustache.
[02:48:24.212 --> 02:48:27.254]  Wanted the land, and Kevin needed a well on his farm, so they traded.
[02:48:27.834 --> 02:48:30.096]  For his 10th birthday, Kevin gave himself a house.
[02:48:30.816 --> 02:48:37.021]  He found a house, a piece of property about seven miles from his home, contacted the owner.
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:41.720]   She was an elderly woman and she had turned down all the other offers, of course,
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:48.559]   because she wanted to preserve this 700 square foot, two bedroom home that her father built.
[02:48:48.559 --> 02:48:50.959]  She didn't want to see it torn down.
[02:48:50.959 --> 02:48:56.000]   So, and she couldn't fix it at her age and she didn't want to keep paying property taxes.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:49:00.040]   So this little 10 year old struck a deal and trade for the deed to the land.
[02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:05.400]   He would pay her back property taxes and her expenses, clear out her father's possessions from the house
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:11.120]   and he promised that he, a 10 year old boy, would personally restore the home and it took two years.
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:18.440]   Countless YouTube videos that he watched and some mentoring by some older contractors, no doubt,
[02:49:18.440 --> 02:49:20.979]  but he did it for $10,000.
[02:49:20.979 --> 02:49:24.720]   When Billy put his foot down, refused to let, Billy's the dad,
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:27.280]  refused to let Kevin do the electrical work himself.
[02:49:27.253 --> 02:49:30.374]  He found an electrician to actually walk him through it.
[02:49:31.474 --> 02:49:32.855]  He wasn't gonna not do it.
[02:49:33.875 --> 02:49:37.757]  He wrote blog posts in his spare time when most kids are playing video games.
[02:49:38.837 --> 02:49:41.458]  He would be up all night writing under the pen name Cole Summers.
[02:49:43.308 --> 02:49:53.730]  And with all of his investments, Kevin socked away the loan payments, tax money, operating funds in the bank, and never took out any money for himself or his family until he knew financial obligations for the year were covered.
[02:49:55.010 --> 02:50:00.011]  And like any teenager, if he needed pocket money, he would do chores for the neighbors.
[02:50:00.391 --> 02:50:19.449]   His parents said his idea of fun was to hire himself out after spending a long day digging post holes for five miles of fencing on his ranch and laying a half-mile water line I couldn't understand why his peers or even adults around him spent so much time scrolling their phones.
[02:50:20.110 --> 02:50:22.071]  What a waste of time, he must have thought.
[02:50:23.331 --> 02:50:32.376]  In 2021, he launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise $100,000 to build an accessible home for his disabled parents who are wheelchair-bound.
[02:50:33.377 --> 02:50:33.937]  He failed.
[02:50:33.977 --> 02:50:34.858]  He only raised $920.
[02:50:36.559 --> 02:50:40.000]  But with all of his setbacks, he just considered it another learning experience.
[02:50:40.821 --> 02:50:42.662]  He said, if I can't earn it, I'm going to build it.
[02:50:43.789 --> 02:50:49.032]  And he began gathering scrap lumber and studying building codes for Adobe construction.
[02:50:49.052 --> 02:50:57.017]  He even posted a video telling people that yes, in fact, he really is a 14-year-old boy when people didn't believe him.
[02:50:58.098 --> 02:51:04.922]  Can you imagine accomplishing all of this and writing an autobiography by the time you're 14?
[02:51:07.003 --> 02:51:10.766]  In fact, he died in June in a freight kayak accident with his brother.
[02:51:11.506 --> 02:51:12.827]  His brother survived.
[02:51:13.564 --> 02:51:14.225]  But he drowned.
[02:51:15.946 --> 02:51:20.649]  And, you know, most people would probably have never heard of Kevin Cooper.
[02:51:21.470 --> 02:51:24.832]  Probably don't even really know who Cole Summers is.
[02:51:25.793 --> 02:51:27.094]  He would also be Kevin Cooper.
[02:51:28.335 --> 02:51:32.178]  But Kevin Cooper shows a very, very big lesson to us right now.
[02:51:32.999 --> 02:51:34.159]  A couple of lessons, actually.
[02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:39.200]   The reason I wanted to bring this up, not only that, I wanted to pay tribute to a fantastic
[02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:44.160]   young man who I think all of us would probably admire right now, right?
[02:51:44.160 --> 02:51:49.799]   To do so much for his family and to take on so much and want to learn so much by the young
[02:51:49.799 --> 02:51:51.519]  age of 14.
[02:51:51.519 --> 02:51:55.880]   He's accomplished more in his life than most of us will in a lifetime.
[02:51:55.880 --> 02:51:57.560]  So why am I bringing this up today?
[02:51:57.560 --> 02:51:59.920]  Well, there's a couple of reasons.
[02:51:59.920 --> 02:52:02.799]  Number one, people are good.
[02:52:02.799 --> 02:52:06.600]   No matter what we hear in the news every day, people are good.
[02:52:06.403 --> 02:52:15.965]  And you can drive across this entire country and go into every little pocket and corner in town and meet really good-hearted, wonderful people who really care to help.
[02:52:17.586 --> 02:52:27.948]  I also look at Kevin's life and what a model it is for taking our kids out of this curriculum that destroys their brains and destroys who they are and doesn't teach them anything.
[02:52:28.706 --> 02:52:35.468]  Especially with King Frodelot giving out loans like candy and telling people they are dismissed from their contracts.
[02:52:36.808 --> 02:52:43.229]  This kid was raising himself and this kid was basically educating himself the entire way.
[02:52:43.309 --> 02:52:43.569]  Why?
[02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:48.531]  Because in his unschooling program, he got to set the limits for what he learned.
[02:52:49.191 --> 02:52:54.692]  Can you imagine if we gave wings to all of these kids and let them really fly, what would happen?
[02:52:57.031 --> 02:52:59.512]  Today, you know, we tend to knock them a lot.
[02:52:59.532 --> 02:53:02.133]  They're always on their phones, taking selfies and everything else.
[02:53:02.173 --> 02:53:04.074]  And they can become the butt of a joke easily.
[02:53:05.135 --> 02:53:09.977]  But if you really look at it, there are many, many kids out there that are figuring it out just like he did.
[02:53:10.397 --> 02:53:19.581]  And many kids that if you can just get them out of the government system, the indoctrination system, you can't even imagine what they could do, I think.
[02:53:21.062 --> 02:53:22.883]  And I think we need to give them those opportunities.
[02:53:23.663 --> 02:53:25.324]  Get your kids out of the government schools.
[02:53:25.624 --> 02:53:27.564]  Let them do these kinds of things.
[02:53:28.365 --> 02:53:31.606]  My heart goes out to his family, and I know how missed he must be.
[02:53:32.847 --> 02:53:46.132]  And to him, what a legacy he leaves behind of knowing what a 14-year-old can accomplish in a lifetime, and how many kids really ought to look at this as the inspiring notion that they can do it too.
[02:53:47.312 --> 02:53:58.653]   We have good people in this country that really want to save it, and we have good people working Their guts out to do it and to make a life and a living in this free nation.
[02:53:59.094 --> 02:53:59.874]  Let's keep it free.
[02:54:00.294 --> 02:54:03.037]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:54:02.896 --> 02:54:14.896]  Thanks for tuning in today.
[02:54:15.876 --> 02:54:18.119]  Why don't more people stand up for freedom?
[02:54:18.779 --> 02:54:21.742]  Why don't more people fight the globalists and their tyranny?
[02:54:22.443 --> 02:54:26.668]  And the answer is, when you fight them, they come after you.
[02:54:28.257 --> 02:54:30.519]  And the enemies of freedom have come after Infowars.
[02:54:30.559 --> 02:54:31.419]  They've come after us.
[02:54:31.719 --> 02:54:34.241]  They're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[02:54:34.521 --> 02:54:38.324]  And they're on national television saying we want to shut Alex Jones down.
[02:54:38.844 --> 02:54:41.246]  Because they see us as populist, which we are.
[02:54:41.646 --> 02:54:47.150]  They see us as the archetypal example of people that aren't bowing to them.
[02:54:47.930 --> 02:54:52.013]  I don't care if you're black, white, old, young or where you came from in America or anywhere else in the world.
[02:54:52.753 --> 02:54:58.753]   These globalists hate the general public and they hate men more than anything because men
[02:54:58.753 --> 02:55:06.672]   historically have been the ones during times of tyranny to rally to the evil and say no.
[02:55:06.672 --> 02:55:11.153]   And that's why they're coming after us with everything they've got.
[02:55:11.153 --> 02:55:14.653]   So when you ask why doesn't somebody stand up against this evil, the answer is because
[02:55:14.653 --> 02:55:17.272]  most people don't want to take the attacks.
[02:55:17.272 --> 02:55:22.313]   But now it's become clear that submitting to the attacks is way more dangerous and way
[02:55:22.313 --> 02:55:27.083]   more sickening than fighting You actually die on your knees.
[02:55:26.902 --> 02:55:32.642]   with slavery, especially during the endgame, is worse than death. It was Zapata, the great
[02:55:32.642 --> 02:55:36.882]   Mexican revolutionary that said, "It's better to die on your feet than live on your knees
[02:55:36.882 --> 02:55:43.101]   as slaves." But I want to go one further. You actually die on your knees, you live on
[02:55:43.101 --> 02:55:48.941]   your feet! I'm not fighting these people because it's some lost cause and it's just the right
[02:55:49.757 --> 02:55:51.018]  I'd do that if it was the case.
[02:55:51.658 --> 02:55:57.842]  I'd do it because I believe in you and I know we can beat these people, but I need you to believe in yourself.
[02:55:58.542 --> 02:56:15.159]   So at this critical juncture, while the enemies of humanity are doing everything they can to try to silence you and your family, It is more important than ever that you spread the word about InfoWars and about the reports and the guests we have because they fear us for a good reason.
[02:56:15.220 --> 02:56:17.181]  We've got their number and we know how to beat them.
[02:56:18.242 --> 02:56:22.184]  Separately, we try to sell the best products we can because we want them to work.
[02:56:22.204 --> 02:56:23.025]  We want you to love them.
[02:56:23.045 --> 02:56:24.205]  We want you to come back and get them.
[02:56:24.466 --> 02:56:26.387]  They took our sponsors away more than a decade ago.
[02:56:27.067 --> 02:56:33.432]  And our flagship product that has funded so much of the great work we've done together, thanks to your support, is DNA Force Plus.

[02:57:50.532 --> 02:57:54.534]  You see how much they're trying to shut us down because they're scared of you coalescing.
[02:57:54.774 --> 02:57:56.255]  They're scared of you coming together.
[02:57:56.275 --> 02:58:04.118]  They're scared of you supporting freedom and justice because they know it's so popular that if the free market of ideas is allowed, it's over for the New World Order.
[02:58:04.499 --> 02:58:05.539]  DNA Force Plus.
