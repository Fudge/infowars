[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:12.528]  It's Thursday, November 24th, the year 2022.
[00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:13.528]  It is Thanksgiving.
[00:00:13.528 --> 00:00:15.569]  This is our special Thanksgiving broadcast.
[00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:18.208]  And I want to thank you all for joining us today.
[00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:20.728]  I want to tell you what's coming up.
[00:00:20.728 --> 00:00:27.048]   I did a hour and a half interview with Dr. Sherry Tenpenny a few weeks ago that listeners
[00:00:27.048 --> 00:00:30.649]  and viewers that saw it really gave us great reviews from.
[00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:37.009]   So we're going to be airing that Dr. Sherry Tenpenny interview with me coming up in hour
[00:00:37.009 --> 00:00:39.688]  one and part of hour two.
[00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:42.889]   Then we had Vivian Kubrick and Sean Stone in studio, an amazing hour.
[00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:44.408]  That's going to be an hour three.
[00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:52.209]   And then the super informative, amazing researcher, Jay Dyer is in the fourth hour today.
[00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:55.048]   Tomorrow on the Friday edition, we're going to have that special David Icke interview,
[00:00:55.048 --> 00:00:57.529]  George Christensen, Mike Adams and more.
[00:00:57.529 --> 00:01:00.289]  And I just want to wish you all an amazing Thanksgiving.
[00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.368]   And I'm just very, very thankful for all of you and what you've done.
[00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.201]  I wanted to hit a story that came out a few days ago on Infowars.com that I've not yet gotten to that's so important.
[00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:19.444]  High-end fashion brand ads shows young kids holding sex-bondage teddy bears with child porn court papers in the background.
[00:01:20.224 --> 00:01:32.689]   And it's literal bondage, torture, S&M dolls with what looks like three or four-year-olds There's a whole bunch of this that's really hard to look at.
[00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.011]  And then on the desk in front of them are court papers.
[00:01:37.832 --> 00:01:40.413]  One of the Supreme Court legalized simulated child porn.
[00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:44.015]  And it's some kind of bizarre celebration of that.
[00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:47.837]  And so everybody should be aware that this is going on.
[00:01:48.917 --> 00:02:01.069]   And the fact that these companies are pushing this, I mean this really is They're cult, and as Owen Schroyer said a few days ago, you just cannot compromise with this level of evil.
[00:02:01.089 --> 00:02:04.033]  I don't even want to say the name of the company on air and give them any attention.
[00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:12.624]  It's one of the top luxury brands in the world, and they sell sunglasses and shoes and bags and clothing and jewelry.
[00:02:13.264 --> 00:02:15.246]  And it's just absolutely, truly disgusting.
[00:02:15.266 --> 00:02:17.587]  Again, the headline, high-end fashion brand.
[00:02:18.088 --> 00:02:23.151]  Ad shows young kids holding sex-bonded teddy bears with child porn court papers in the background.
[00:02:23.912 --> 00:02:24.993]  This is who we're dealing with.
[00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:33.138]  This is the type of people that are waging war on our civilization, on our children, because they know they've got to destroy the innocence of the future if they're going to win.
[00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:38.444]  Now here at InfoWars we are not selling stuff using child porn marketing.
[00:02:39.045 --> 00:02:48.715]  We're marketing health and immune system and the fact that when you buy products at InfoWarsTore.com it funds the InfoWar and it funds freedom and it funds the human resistance and it funds pro-life.
[00:02:49.675 --> 00:02:52.155]  And right now we have the biggest sale in our history.
[00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:57.195]   Yes, it's been going on for about a month or so, between 40 and 60% off with promo code 1776
[00:02:57.195 --> 00:02:58.194]  and double Patreon points.
[00:02:58.194 --> 00:03:03.435]   But now we've added only until December 1st, 'cause we've estimated that all the products will sell out
[00:03:03.435 --> 00:03:06.534]  by then that we've got set aside as free gifts.

[00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:27.277]  I mean, there's just hundreds of different items that are being offered that are randomly selected by the shopping cart computer.
[00:03:27.717 --> 00:03:28.957]  When you do each order.
[00:03:29.357 --> 00:03:30.858]  So that's the best that we've ever offered.
[00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:35.319]  It's a clearance sale to get the money in we need during this bankruptcy to make sure we stay on air.
[00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:42.181]  We're doing Chapter 11, Subchapter 5, which means we will stay on air as long as we can be profitable into the future.
[00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:44.081]  And the court's looking at all that right now.
[00:03:44.482 --> 00:03:46.502]  And we're right where we need to be, but just barely.
[00:03:47.022 --> 00:03:48.803]  So again, give yourself the gift of freedom.
[00:03:48.823 --> 00:03:50.043]  Give yourself the gift of liberty.
[00:03:51.163 --> 00:03:53.264]  Give yourself the gift of keeping real independent.

[00:04:39.703 --> 00:04:41.945]  We've got some big interviews, as I just mentioned, coming up.
[00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:46.649]  Please continue to do your amazing part, your critical part, by sharing the live feeds and links.

[00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.710]  Actually, on big orders, you get more than one gift.

[00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:17.752]  And we're not just talking about, in some cases, it'll be a bunch of bumper stickers or an Alex Jones mask.
[00:05:17.772 --> 00:05:21.793]  In some cases, it'll be a book or a film or just a bunch of other amazing items.
[00:05:21.813 --> 00:05:24.573]  So we have some big ticket items as well that are going to be free gifts.
[00:05:24.853 --> 00:05:27.354]  Free gifts with every single order.

[00:05:39.623 --> 00:05:47.109]  It just goes through with all the items, hundreds of different items, that we're going to be able to offer free, and just randomly picks one of those and puts it in the box.
[00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.771]  So this is undoubtedly now, officially, the biggest sell we've ever done.

[00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:15.136]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:06:15.136 --> 00:06:17.136]  God is love.
[00:06:16.245 --> 00:06:18.025]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:21.417 --> 00:06:24.659]  Let me introduce to you a guest that really needs no introduction.
[00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:34.604]  My longtime friend, colleague, partner in crime, partner fighting all these terrorist sort of people that are out there, all of the Kabal and the globalists, Alex Jones.
[00:06:34.724 --> 00:06:39.246]  I just can't even believe that Alex said he'd come and be on my podcast this morning.
[00:06:39.507 --> 00:06:45.770]  Alex, what a pleasure and an honor it is to welcome you to our podcast this week with Dr. T this morning.
[00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:58.354]  It's amazing, hard to believe I've been interviewing you for 22 years and now I'm here on your broadcast which I know is so successful reaching people and that's why you're one of the top two people that Big Pharma and the Deep State's attacking.
[00:06:58.414 --> 00:07:00.014]  It's you and Dr. Peter McCullough.
[00:07:00.414 --> 00:07:07.305]   They're specifically singling out everywhere enemies. So that's one of the greatest rewards you can get
[00:07:07.305 --> 00:07:11.035]   is to have some of those evil people on earth see you as their top enemy. So
[00:07:11.035 --> 00:07:14.715]   congratulations Dr. Sherry Tidpinney. You are in a very elite club and
[00:07:14.715 --> 00:07:18.254]   folks should be praying for you and supporting you because you're a woman of great
[00:07:18.254 --> 00:07:22.175]   strength and honor and courage but you are definitely under massive
[00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:28.413]   attack and in the heart of the fight so I salute you. Well thank you very much Alexi.
[00:07:26.438 --> 00:07:35.421]  You know, I've done between March of 2020 and December of 21, I did over 600 interviews, and usually I do about 30 a year.
[00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:47.666]  And people have always asked me when I've been on their interview, what does it feel like to be labeled as the disinformation dozen and to be called out by the person who calls himself president as one of the most dangerous people in America?
[00:07:47.746 --> 00:07:50.387]  I said, I kind of wear it like a little badge of courage over here, you know?
[00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:51.108]  I just do.
[00:07:53.337 --> 00:08:00.962]  So, I wanted to start out by asking you, because I read something that InfoWars published, I think yesterday or last night, about David Icke.
[00:08:01.642 --> 00:08:06.986]  I mean, he's another one amongst us that's been doing this for decades, and now he's been banned from the EU.
[00:08:07.786 --> 00:08:10.188]  And he's been labeled a Level 3 terrorist.
[00:08:10.268 --> 00:08:16.312]  And we talked a little before we went live about what a Level... Explain to the audience what Level 1 and Level 2 is and Level 3.
[00:08:16.352 --> 00:08:19.514]  And if he's a Level 3 terrorist, what does that make us?
[00:08:20.353 --> 00:08:23.256]  They would call us Level 3 as well.
[00:08:23.296 --> 00:08:29.722]  What they do is they take a real terrorist planning to blow something up, who's got a bomb or a gun and about to go do something, and they call that a Level 1.
[00:08:29.942 --> 00:08:30.803]  That's a real terrorist.
[00:08:31.464 --> 00:08:33.666]  And then you've got Level 2 as material support.
[00:08:34.927 --> 00:08:37.269]  And then a Level 3 is not a terrorist.
[00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:51.657]   They say, well, even though you're not even talking about terrorism or pushing violence, if you criticize the government or say there's a deep state, Or undermine the system in any way by saying it's wrong, trying to reprove it, trying to change it, you know, a basic part of living in a free society.
[00:08:51.677 --> 00:08:55.178]  Then we're going to call you a level three terrorist and restrict your movement.
[00:08:55.198 --> 00:08:56.458]  And it's the same all over the world.
[00:08:56.478 --> 00:08:59.199]  They're trying to bring in similar systems here in the U.S.
[00:08:59.259 --> 00:09:01.399]  And it's not just David Icke saying this.
[00:09:01.919 --> 00:09:09.281]  On Infowars.com, obviously, we have a transcript translated from the Dutch letter, but it's under EU authority.
[00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:16.563]   And in the Dutch letter, it says that he's banned for two years Because he speaks to crowds of 50 to 100,000.
[00:09:16.743 --> 00:09:18.063]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:09:18.123 --> 00:09:29.047]  has spoken to crowds of a million and they're trying to ban him right now as well by saying, you criticize the corporations, the power structure, so that's terrorism.
[00:09:29.087 --> 00:09:33.408]  So your free speech is now terrorism, which is really their endgame.
[00:09:33.428 --> 00:09:41.068]   And we saw in June of 2000, and 21, we saw Biden's official new Homeland Security
[00:09:41.068 --> 00:09:44.868]   directive saying white supremacism is the number one terror threat.
[00:09:44.868 --> 00:09:49.228]   They then defined in that new national policy paper directed by the president
[00:09:49.228 --> 00:09:55.148]   over the executive branch, the FBI, the CIA, DHS, that criticizing election
[00:09:55.148 --> 00:10:01.828]   fraud, criticizing lockdowns, forced injections, or open borders.
[00:10:01.828 --> 00:10:05.568]   And now it came out two weeks ago, the intercept more documents or
[00:10:05.568 --> 00:10:09.628]   criticizing man-made global warming, saying it's not real or even questioning
[00:10:09.628 --> 00:10:13.107]  or, or questioning the.
[00:10:13.107 --> 00:10:23.107]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:10:14.235 --> 00:10:20.318]  Pull out a year ago out of Afghanistan that you're also a extremist and need to be censored.
[00:10:20.358 --> 00:10:28.523]  So they define you as a terrorist or a white supremacist for simply being a good citizen and being engaged and then say that you're the main terror threat.
[00:10:28.803 --> 00:10:30.424]  That is official U.S.
[00:10:30.484 --> 00:10:31.625]  government policy now.
[00:10:33.143 --> 00:10:37.327]  Alex, you know, we went to war in World War II over this sort of censorship.
[00:10:37.427 --> 00:10:44.272]  We set up Radio Free Europe after World War II, even though we know that that was a CIA PSYOP and all those other things.
[00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:52.439]  But ostensibly, I mean, on the surface, I mean, the thing was to try to get past what the propaganda message was, the over and over propaganda message was.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.680]  And here we are.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.562]  I mean, the United States of America.
[00:10:55.602 --> 00:10:56.803]  Did you ever think?
[00:10:56.903 --> 00:11:01.227]  I mean, well, yes, you did, because Infowars has been around for a long time.
[00:11:01.687 --> 00:11:07.272]  And, you know, I said to you back at the beginning of this plandemic thing, I said, congratulations, Alex.
[00:11:07.312 --> 00:11:11.475]  I mean, you've been prophetic when you said InfoWars was what was happening.
[00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:20.863]  I mean, but it's one thing to talk about it like in hushed circles amongst friends and colleagues that are of like mind.
[00:11:21.463 --> 00:11:23.744]  Now, it's so out in the open.
[00:11:23.764 --> 00:11:35.388]  You know, we used to talk about things like adenochrome and human trafficking and pedophilia behind closed doors, you know, only with friends and family that you knew were on the same page as you.
[00:11:35.708 --> 00:11:40.390]  But now it is so obvious with the depopulation agenda of what they're doing and going forward.
[00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.891]  What do you think is the next step?
[00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:51.115]  I mean, you've been prophetically talking about this for 30 years, you know, like I've been talking about vaccine issues for 22 years.
[00:11:51.975 --> 00:11:54.516]  Where do you think they are going to go next?
[00:11:55.537 --> 00:11:56.877]  Well, that's the most important question.
[00:11:56.917 --> 00:12:03.380]  And just to be clear, I was prophetically led by God and the Holy Spirit to look into these things.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:13.511]   But really, when I began to read the books by Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, David Rockefeller, I knew this was all coming when I first got on air 28 years ago.
[00:12:13.531 --> 00:12:18.715]  I was really awake 32, 33 years ago, even when I was in high school.
[00:12:19.575 --> 00:12:21.657]  But I've been on air 28 years since I was 21.
[00:12:21.697 --> 00:12:25.600]  I knew this was all coming because it was in the documents.
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:33.586]  But the reason I was interested in the documents is my mother's brother, who died a few years ago, best guy I ever knew.
[00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:38.797]  He'd been this big, you know, star, youngest ever ham radio operator.
[00:12:38.857 --> 00:12:43.360]  He won national awards for being the fastest Morse code operator.
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:45.921]  And he was a Vietnam war hero.
[00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:48.262]  But none of us ever knew that until he died.
[00:12:48.282 --> 00:12:49.443]  We knew he was in Vietnam.
[00:12:50.223 --> 00:12:58.608]  But then he was involved in Iran-Contra and involved in high-level management of a lot of really big things.
[00:12:59.327 --> 00:13:06.447]   And he saw some things in Guatemala and other areas where he was in charge of setting up bases and things
[00:13:06.447 --> 00:13:10.048]  to fight the communists that really shook him to his core.
[00:13:10.048 --> 00:13:15.567]   And it wasn't till about a year before he died that he told me what it was that made him
[00:13:15.567 --> 00:13:17.206]  get out of these projects.
[00:13:17.206 --> 00:13:21.526]   And for my own safety, he never gave me the specifics of it, but he was in Army Special Operations
[00:13:21.526 --> 00:13:27.268]   and high level directly communicating with the White House because he was the guy that did the Morse code the fastest
[00:13:27.268 --> 00:13:29.727]  and all the rest of it, so he was in charge.
[00:13:29.727 --> 00:13:33.726]   And even back then, they still use Morse code because nobody can basically crack the special codes
[00:13:33.726 --> 00:13:34.567]  they use and things.
[00:13:34.567 --> 00:13:39.327]   They still use low tech on the submarines, a lot of things, that's super secret.
[00:13:39.327 --> 00:13:49.366]   But the point is, is that he told me when I was young, starting at about 13, when I would go down every summer
[00:13:49.366 --> 00:13:53.766]   from Dallas and visit them for a week or two to visit my cousins in San Antonio,
[00:13:53.977 --> 00:13:58.499]  He basically, uh, you know, taught me how the cow ate the cabbage.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:10.582]   And so I really understood a lot of My dad was also really big on history and things, so I would ask him about Zbigniew Brzezinski and the New World Order and things.
[00:14:11.302 --> 00:14:19.108]  And so that's really why I know that, was because of William Forrest Hammond, my uncle, is really the main reason we have Alex Jones today.
[00:14:20.287 --> 00:14:22.268]  And where do you think we're going to go next, Alex?
[00:14:22.408 --> 00:14:25.149]  And you know, it's interesting that you and I have sort of similar upbringings.
[00:14:25.649 --> 00:14:33.953]  My mom's younger brother was into studying all of the things about the Illuminati and about the Council on Four Relations and all of those things.
[00:14:33.973 --> 00:14:40.896]  So when I was a teenager, I remember sitting around the dining room table with my mom's younger brother and my mom and my dad talking about all these things.
[00:14:40.976 --> 00:14:42.897]  I must've been maybe in my teens.
[00:14:43.437 --> 00:14:53.363]   So, you know, as this whole thing unfolded, I've got a big library upstairs of much older books that I don't even think they're in print anymore, from listening to that growing up.
[00:14:53.403 --> 00:14:54.444]  So that's pretty interesting.
[00:14:54.464 --> 00:14:58.547]  We've gotten to this point kind of with that same growing up background.
[00:14:59.068 --> 00:15:00.109]  So here we are.
[00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:04.692]  And I, how do we, you know, everybody says, how do we stop them?
[00:15:04.712 --> 00:15:08.895]  I'm not sure how we stop them other than just with more information.
[00:15:09.376 --> 00:15:11.757]  Because I think the train has left the tracks.
[00:15:11.817 --> 00:15:13.399]  I mean, when you looked at that world, I agree.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:21.234]  I'm glad you went back to your actual question, because I kind of digressed into the first part and didn't get to the second part.
[00:15:25.373 --> 00:15:26.493]  What you said is so key.
[00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:36.936]  Because of countless people going back to Barry Goldwater and the John Byrd Society and all those folks that turned out were dead on, they were the ones that were really prophetic.
[00:15:36.815 --> 00:15:42.815]   We, a lot of people around the country, especially in the Midwest, and just all over the nation,
[00:15:42.815 --> 00:15:46.815]  really were awake to what was going on.
[00:15:46.815 --> 00:15:59.815]  [Music]
[00:16:00.452 --> 00:16:06.877]  For only the second time in the entirety of the info or store, we are announcing a selling out mega blowout sale.

[00:16:38.837 --> 00:16:49.640]  After the seemingly never-ending barrage of attacks on us, Alex and the rest of the crew here at InfoWars needs all the help we can get to allow the message of a pro-human future to reach the masses.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:59.327]  Hurry to the store of InfoWars now to check out the Mega Blowout Sale because some of these items are already selling out at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:00.288 --> 00:17:06.893]  In the modern world where they convince a woman to get a job, the man to get a job, they inflate the currency so nobody can exist any other way because it's too expensive.
[00:17:07.174 --> 00:17:08.555]  The parents are out working all day.
[00:17:08.575 --> 00:17:11.357]  The school and the internet and the matrix raise your children.
[00:17:11.477 --> 00:17:14.819]  Your children go to school all day and be told things that you may not want them to learn.
[00:17:14.939 --> 00:17:18.301]  Then they sit on the internet and read things and watch things you may not want them to watch.
[00:17:18.341 --> 00:17:20.822]  You talk to them for 10 minutes at the end of the day, they go to bed.
[00:17:20.862 --> 00:17:27.865]  You're fighting with your 10 minutes against endless hours of the most entertaining programming or the most forceful programming.
[00:17:27.905 --> 00:17:30.146]  In school it's forceful, on the internet it's entertaining.
[00:17:30.407 --> 00:17:32.928]  Convincing them of ideas that you perhaps don't agree with.
[00:17:33.248 --> 00:17:34.389]  I've seen it myself on YouTube.
[00:17:34.449 --> 00:17:38.914]  I've seen a guy in America driving his car and his kids were in the back seat and he was arguing with them about an issue.
[00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:40.655]  And he was like, where did you hear that?
[00:17:40.896 --> 00:17:41.196]  School?
[00:17:41.396 --> 00:17:42.858]  He's like, why did the school tell you that?
[00:17:42.898 --> 00:17:43.378]  That's not true.
[00:17:43.418 --> 00:17:46.461]  And his own children are arguing with him because they learned it in school.
[00:17:46.601 --> 00:17:47.943]  Have you ever tried to take your children out of school?
[00:17:48.143 --> 00:17:48.703]  You'll get fined.
[00:17:48.723 --> 00:17:49.364]  You'll get in trouble.
[00:17:49.404 --> 00:17:50.605]  No, your kids have to go to school.
[00:17:50.765 --> 00:17:52.347]  You have to give your kids away to the school.
[00:17:52.627 --> 00:17:55.610]  If you don't give your kids away to the brainwashing, you'll get in trouble.
[00:17:55.971 --> 00:18:07.618]   As an all-star fighter, Businessman, motivational speaker and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has truly earned the title of Top G. But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged the globalists.
[00:18:07.998 --> 00:18:13.141]  He is consecutively the most googled man in the world in the last two years.
[00:18:13.421 --> 00:18:18.024]  And that's because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.
[00:18:18.504 --> 00:18:24.188]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.

[00:18:50.236 --> 00:18:59.123]  I think there's a whole bunch of men in the world who understands my value, and if men grow up to be like me, you're gonna have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record, dedicated athletes, who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[00:19:00.913 --> 00:19:02.834]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[00:19:03.174 --> 00:19:05.496]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[00:19:05.836 --> 00:19:11.219]  Now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[00:19:11.639 --> 00:19:15.861]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[00:19:16.142 --> 00:19:17.863]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:22.425]  So now is the time to take action to support the InfoWar and get the biggest sales of the year.
[00:19:22.704 --> 00:19:27.904]   We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and BioTrue Selenium and our Wake Up America award-winning
[00:19:27.904 --> 00:19:28.904]  coffee.
[00:19:28.904 --> 00:19:34.024]   And now, DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, so many

[00:19:58.893 --> 00:19:59.353]  God bless.
[00:20:02.473 --> 00:20:09.473]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.473 --> 00:20:26.473]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[00:20:26.727 --> 00:20:31.069]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:31.809 --> 00:20:37.391]  A lot of people around the country, especially in the Midwest and just all over the nation, really were awake.
[00:20:38.639 --> 00:20:52.023]  Uh, to what was going on in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, back when it was just embryonic, because there were a lot of people in the system that were being inducted into this tyranny who didn't like it, who were whistleblowers, and who came out and exposed it.
[00:20:52.063 --> 00:20:59.005]  So everything we're seeing today is what they said was coming because they were attempting to basically set up the programs for it back then.
[00:20:59.325 --> 00:21:12.414]   So we, so a lot of those internal folks in government, corporations, in the medical system, The clergy in the educational system held it back for decades and decades.
[00:21:13.254 --> 00:21:24.239]  And so now, because there was such a backstop against it of people working for 60, 70 years quietly, or as loud as they could, but being suppressed, it was still pretty quiet.
[00:21:24.279 --> 00:21:28.161]  As you said, you whispered here and there, pamphlets, books, a few films here and there.
[00:21:29.101 --> 00:21:30.142]  We weren't caught completely.
[00:21:31.112 --> 00:21:31.652]  Flat-footed.
[00:21:31.692 --> 00:21:45.402]  And so, in the last five years, the globalists have gone from denying all their programs to taking the mask off now and just emerging with, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll like it, you'll have a world ID card, you'll have a microchip to buy and sell.
[00:21:45.822 --> 00:21:53.407]  This is all being officially announced everywhere in an attempt to where if they couldn't covertly implement it, they'll go ahead and just overtly implement it.
[00:21:53.447 --> 00:21:56.743]   But there was always a point Where you would have emergence.
[00:21:57.324 --> 00:22:00.226]  I mean, even if you're going to have a say, an army sneak attack a position.
[00:22:00.746 --> 00:22:05.229]  Okay, they sneak up, they get in position, but there finally comes the point of the attack.
[00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:11.154]  And so we're now gone from the beta testing into their operational system.
[00:22:11.194 --> 00:22:17.177]   So what comes next is More bioweapon releases from labs, which we now know COVID was.
[00:22:17.197 --> 00:22:31.336]  They're now creating the backstory of, at Boston University, humanized mice that again, as you know, as a doctor, act just like humans, basically the same death rate would be in humans, they estimate, of 80%, a super gain-of-function weapon.
[00:22:31.776 --> 00:22:36.041]  They now developed similar systems in London, broke last week as well.
[00:22:36.341 --> 00:22:48.515]  So they're even letting us know where the weapons are, that they've indeed made them, and they've got a gun to our collective heads, trying to hold us hostage, threatening to basically release these if we don't accept their new world order.
[00:22:48.895 --> 00:22:57.881]   And so the whole COVID rollout was the segue from baited operational With the FEMA camps being built here, the COVID centers around the world, all UN policy directed.
[00:22:58.221 --> 00:23:03.183]  The policies created by the WEF itself is just a spokesperson group of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:23:03.223 --> 00:23:07.665]  Klaus Schwab has been on their steering committee since the 70s, except the WEF in the 80s.
[00:23:08.125 --> 00:23:09.465]  WEF emerged in the 90s.
[00:23:10.486 --> 00:23:19.148]   And as a forward-facing PR firm of global governance, corporate, fascist control, allied with communist China.
[00:23:19.148 --> 00:23:22.468]   So the next phase is, they always telegraph what they're gonna do.
[00:23:22.468 --> 00:23:27.509]   Cyber attacks they blame on the Russians or private groups to have intermittent power outages and disruptions
[00:23:27.509 --> 00:23:33.709]   to sell an internet ID and more control in the name of keeping us safe from hackers.
[00:23:33.709 --> 00:23:40.107]   More viral releases, more attempts at lockdowns, more attempts at forced injections,
[00:23:40.107 --> 00:23:45.548]   and testing with these injections, progressively getting more toxic, more poisonous,
[00:23:45.548 --> 00:23:50.108]   more dangerous to see if they can manage the maiming and killing of us
[00:23:50.108 --> 00:23:55.667]   as the ambient background noise of the soft kill weapons are turned up.
[00:23:55.667 --> 00:24:01.429]   That's why it's so beautiful what you and countless others, but you at the tip of the spear,
[00:24:01.429 --> 00:24:05.307]   with just a few other top people have done mobilizing against it,
[00:24:05.307 --> 00:24:08.028]   is they're asking, as you know, in Atlantic Monthly two weeks ago,
[00:24:08.028 --> 00:24:19.401]   which is the globalist mouthpiece, Oh, we're sorry about lockdowns, we're sorry about masks, we're sorry about the shot not working, as they still try to push it on school children, as they try to make it, quote, federally recommended.
[00:24:19.781 --> 00:24:23.083]  So they can then bully people and claim it's mandatory through that fraud, as you know.
[00:24:23.964 --> 00:24:32.789]  And so they now want us to forget about what they just did the last three years so that we have that collective amnesia so they can do it again, but on a much more deadly scale.
[00:24:33.209 --> 00:24:42.295]  What we've been through in the last three years is a drill for martial law lockdowns when they release the really deadly bioweapons with a cocktail of other things.
[00:24:42.335 --> 00:24:44.356]  They can hit a city with a chemical weapon.
[00:24:45.195 --> 00:24:48.135]   uh... that has a uh... slow kill effect
[00:24:48.135 --> 00:24:51.836]   and that that mimics viruses or or or or bacterial infections
[00:24:51.836 --> 00:24:56.445]   and then and then and then claim it's that uh... as well so they've got a lot of different battle
[00:24:56.445 --> 00:24:58.596]   plans of the sunshine project
[00:24:58.596 --> 00:25:02.355]   uh... fifteen years ago uh... out of austin were got a document of the
[00:25:02.355 --> 00:25:06.596]   classified about a generation american scientists
[00:25:06.596 --> 00:25:11.015]   and in it the marine corps was trading with the army with drone helicopters
[00:25:11.015 --> 00:25:15.096]   uh... to have helicopters go around and spray opiates on cities
[00:25:15.096 --> 00:25:19.454]   and quote, make everybody pass out so the government can bring in martial law.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:28.063]  They estimated that over 10% of the public would actually die in accidents, fires, and car wrecks when they did spray the cities with the chemical weapons.
[00:25:28.103 --> 00:25:31.584]  So we have real things like that actually on the books.
[00:25:32.065 --> 00:25:33.685]  The shadow government is not our friend.
[00:25:33.925 --> 00:25:37.967]   As Dr. Peter McCullough wrote a big article two days ago, I just interviewed him yesterday for two hours.
[00:25:38.007 --> 00:25:39.267]  That's it, banned on video.
[00:25:40.028 --> 00:25:41.849]  And he comes out now.
[00:25:42.169 --> 00:25:46.911]  He knew this two years ago when he first came on my show, but said he wasn't ready to go public yet, like you had done.
[00:25:47.531 --> 00:25:52.513]  He took the gloves off and said, no, a shadow global government is in control of the Pentagon.
[00:25:52.873 --> 00:26:02.678]  The Pentagon has run the rollout of the shots through the UN, through Pfizer, through Moderna, through Bill Gates, and is actually attacking its own people and attacking our troops particularly.
[00:26:02.958 --> 00:26:04.919]  So it's not our military per se.
[00:26:05.379 --> 00:26:14.605]  But it's the military industrial complex that Eisenhower warned of that is actually directly working for the central banks that is carrying all this out.
[00:26:14.825 --> 00:26:16.086]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:26:16.546 --> 00:26:19.828]  There's two things that you said in there that I want to circle back to and ask you about.
[00:26:19.848 --> 00:26:29.534]  I mean, one is when you said that this was a kind of a warm up round for what they have next, which I've kind of said the same thing in a lot of my interviews and podcasts.
[00:26:31.455 --> 00:26:42.290]  I had been told by somebody early on, like this would have been in 2020, that this and the first article that I wrote in March 2020 after this stuff rolled out was same playbook, different virus.
[00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:44.233]  That was the first article that I wrote.
[00:26:44.934 --> 00:26:57.885]   And I had been told that You know, they thought, the WEF creatures, I call them, thought that this was just another trial balloon to see where they were on that continuum along that plan that they had.
[00:26:57.905 --> 00:27:07.013]  Because they had SARS, then they had MERS, then they had bird flu in 2005, they had H1N1 in 2009, and this was just another toss it out there and see where we are.
[00:27:07.553 --> 00:27:13.538]   And that the reason that they went full court press Was because the Americans rolled over.
[00:27:14.138 --> 00:27:24.185]  That Americans just put on a mask, closed their businesses, cowered down and feared in their corner, and that the Americans didn't say, no way.
[00:27:24.746 --> 00:27:30.650]  And I just was talking, I was at one of Clay Clarke's events two weeks ago, and I talked to somebody who had spent the last five months in Europe.
[00:27:30.829 --> 00:27:35.230]  talking to pretty high-level people throughout the EU.
[00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:39.730]   And she said every single country that she went to and talked to high-level officiants,
[00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:45.730]   she said the first thing out of their mouth was, "Where the hell are the Americans?"
[00:27:45.730 --> 00:27:47.728]  You know, why?
[00:27:47.219 --> 00:27:47.859]  Where are we?
[00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:49.360]  And you know it, Alex.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:49.980]  You know it's true.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.300]  I mean, everybody hears it.
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.561]  They go, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
[00:27:53.141 --> 00:27:55.682]  I think part of it is because there's not enough pain here yet.
[00:27:56.143 --> 00:27:58.884]  They tried to induce pain with the increase of gas prices.
[00:27:59.244 --> 00:28:01.185]  You know, people still have food.
[00:28:01.245 --> 00:28:01.945]  They still have heat.
[00:28:01.985 --> 00:28:04.026]  They still have their businesses, whatever.
[00:28:04.847 --> 00:28:06.387]  Where do you think that is?
[00:28:06.627 --> 00:28:09.129]  Where the hell are the Americans in this battle?
[00:28:10.749 --> 00:28:16.065]   Well, I want to answer that, but going back to what you said about how this is a Same playbook, different virus.
[00:28:16.085 --> 00:28:25.336]  We know from Operation Lockstep 2011 and the tabletop exercises in 2019, Event 201, that they've been beta testing and drilling this.
[00:28:25.717 --> 00:28:35.806]   If you go back to a year and a half before they released the virus out of Wuhan and then the more deadly shot, Remember, uh, that they were saying all over the news, Disease X is coming.
[00:28:36.547 --> 00:28:39.909]  And when it comes, we're gonna have to lock down and take control to make you do all this.
[00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:45.753]  So that's how I was able to predict, you're not gonna be able to go to a ball game, you're gonna have to wear a mask, they're gonna lock you in your house.
[00:28:45.913 --> 00:28:46.914]  Well, I wasn't predicting it.
[00:28:47.655 --> 00:28:49.896]  They, they war game and battle plan this.
[00:28:50.477 --> 00:28:57.081]  Then if you look at Spars, 2025-2028 war game from two years before they released the virus.
[00:28:57.121 --> 00:28:57.542]  What was that?
[00:28:57.562 --> 00:28:57.702]  It's 2018.

[00:31:10.438 --> 00:31:14.359]  Let's say a nuke, when it goes off, goes off there, we'll know it.
[00:31:14.599 --> 00:31:19.561]  Those of us who are able to communicate, but in essence, you're watching the destruction.
[00:31:20.121 --> 00:31:23.524]  And they desire to have total control over all information.
[00:31:23.604 --> 00:31:27.026]  Total information awareness and total information control.
[00:31:27.346 --> 00:31:38.714]  The satellite phone and the bivy stick are the only way that you can stay certain of being able to access different communication people that will have these.

[00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:53.730]  This is critical.
[00:32:53.730 --> 00:33:02.730]  This is critical.
[00:33:02.730 --> 00:33:07.230]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:07.028 --> 00:33:09.028]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.028 --> 00:33:21.028]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:21.592 --> 00:33:23.052]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:23.512 --> 00:33:25.513]  Our love is unconditional.
[00:33:27.113 --> 00:33:31.014]  We knew it from the start.
[00:33:33.534 --> 00:33:40.534]   You can feel it from my heart From here on after
[00:33:40.534 --> 00:33:47.534]   Let's stay the way we are right now And share all the love and laughter
[00:33:47.534 --> 00:33:53.534]   That a lifetime Will allow
[00:33:53.534 --> 00:34:00.534]   I cross my heart And promise...
[00:34:00.534 --> 00:34:07.274]   If you look at SPARS 2025-2028 war game from two years before they released the
[00:34:07.274 --> 00:34:09.534]   virus What was it? 2018
[00:34:09.534 --> 00:34:11.094]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:34:10.555 --> 00:34:19.002]  If you look at that multi-hundred page document, it even has example tweets of what they would put out, and it's really set in the year 2020-2023.
[00:34:19.702 --> 00:34:25.607]  And how they would roll it out, and how people would learn they were being poisoned, and the tweets are basically the exact same tweets.
[00:34:26.905 --> 00:34:29.647]  Even the same acronyms, they just switch them around.
[00:34:30.047 --> 00:34:34.049]  And so they were using that as a battle plan for their whole scripted operation.
[00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:36.430]  That way, they get caught with it.
[00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:37.491]  Oh, it's just a drill.
[00:34:37.551 --> 00:34:38.772]  It's just a tabletop exercise.
[00:34:39.052 --> 00:34:44.394]  They're not caught with their actual battle plan that's just set in 2020-2023.
[00:34:44.414 --> 00:34:45.235]  But what was your other question?
[00:34:46.301 --> 00:34:50.123]  Um, what, how do we get Americans more engaged in this?
[00:34:50.183 --> 00:35:01.449]  I mean, when we look at, I mean, we had the truckers going all across Canada, you know, we had, uh, when you look at the, the farmers that happened in the Netherlands and what they did and they, they put manure all over everybody.
[00:35:01.909 --> 00:35:04.030]  I mean, we have huge... I'll tell you how it happened.
[00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:04.831]  I'll tell you how it happened.
[00:35:05.311 --> 00:35:08.353]  The perfect PSYOP, and I'm not saying Trump's a bad person.
[00:35:08.373 --> 00:35:10.494]  It would take an hour to analyze why he did it.
[00:35:10.634 --> 00:35:21.922]  Just like he was for Regeneron, and just like he was for hydroxychloroquine, and just like he was for ivermectin, he just trusted the doctors and said, just legalize everything, accelerate everything.
[00:35:22.722 --> 00:35:31.173]  Which they acted like was his plan, but we know from a 2018 meeting that Fauci had on C-SPAN, they said, we want to blow up the old system.
[00:35:31.493 --> 00:35:32.955]  We want to bring in mRNA.
[00:35:33.275 --> 00:35:35.558]  We don't want a five-year or 10-year test.
[00:35:36.239 --> 00:35:39.743]  It'll probably be a virus out of China, something that's respiratory.
[00:35:40.605 --> 00:35:43.684]   they were telling people what they were doing at this big consortium meeting
[00:35:43.684 --> 00:35:48.204]   with DHS heads and CDC heads and others and and they were describing how they're
[00:35:48.204 --> 00:35:53.684]   gonna use probably a respiratory virus out of China as the pretext to bring in
[00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:58.483]   this regime and about a week ago it broke that the National Security
[00:35:58.483 --> 00:36:05.204]   Council was under the CDC and others rolling out in 2000 a plan that had been
[00:36:05.204 --> 00:36:09.844]   created in the last decade before and what they believe perfected so as you
[00:36:09.844 --> 00:36:14.844]  said they had this on the shelf, they were ready for this.
[00:36:12.991 --> 00:36:14.193]  It's on record they did.
[00:36:15.215 --> 00:36:24.812]   And so when Trump went along with the initial phase of it and Americans saw all the fear. At first a lot
[00:36:24.812 --> 00:36:29.703]   of Republicans went along with Trump for the first few months. Then Trump began
[00:36:29.703 --> 00:36:32.853]   to figure it out and began to say hey we probably don't need to keep
[00:36:32.853 --> 00:36:36.393]   lockdowns going hey you shouldn't have to take a shot but this shot will hopefully
[00:36:36.393 --> 00:36:40.222]   protect you because you want to reopen things. And then the Democrats made it
[00:36:40.222 --> 00:36:46.733]   political oh look Trump doesn't want to reopen I mean Trump wants to reopen.
[00:36:44.731 --> 00:36:45.552]  He wants to kill you.
[00:36:45.613 --> 00:36:51.460]  They became the party of pushing the whole agenda, which was always scripted as alien dialectic.
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.802]  So Trump got Americans to stand down.
[00:36:55.169 --> 00:36:57.951]  First Pelosi's like, oh no, don't lock down Chinatown.
[00:36:58.091 --> 00:36:59.612]  Oh no, everything's fine.
[00:37:00.072 --> 00:37:06.075]  Knowing that Trump would then politically want to be the savior was all psychology because they had this whole war game.
[00:37:06.315 --> 00:37:07.636]  They'd all profiled Trump.
[00:37:08.016 --> 00:37:11.738]  He would come in and support it until he figured out that it was basically a political trap.
[00:37:12.119 --> 00:37:17.100]   And so it was Donald Trump that basically helped put America to sleep.
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:22.459]   Then they made it a political issue, left versus right, and the left used Trump hate to push it
[00:37:22.459 --> 00:37:25.339]  as a political agenda to keep things locked down.
[00:37:25.339 --> 00:37:31.820]   And so the lockdowns, the deadly shots, the surveillance, the vaccine passports became a sacrament of the left now
[00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:33.580]  and their new religion.
[00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:36.580]  And so they were already able to convert 30,000.
[00:37:36.594 --> 00:37:37.435]  That's very, very well stated.
[00:37:37.455 --> 00:37:39.416]  Do you think Trump will ever denounce the shots?
[00:37:39.736 --> 00:37:39.917]  No.
[00:37:39.777 --> 00:37:45.137]   big pharma, Stockholm Syndrome cult, and that's how the psychological warfare, the alien dialectic
[00:37:45.137 --> 00:37:46.916]  was used.
[00:37:46.916 --> 00:37:48.295]  Very well stated, Alex.
[00:37:48.295 --> 00:37:50.135]  That's very, very well stated.
[00:37:50.135 --> 00:37:53.215]  Do you think Trump will ever denounce the shots?
[00:37:53.215 --> 00:37:54.215]  No.
[00:37:54.215 --> 00:37:58.295]   He, you know, his strength in going up against the globalists is that he's so pig-headed
[00:37:58.295 --> 00:38:00.737]  they couldn't make him do what they wanted.
[00:38:00.737 --> 00:38:04.537]  But then he will, and he does, go with his ego first.
[00:38:05.305 --> 00:38:24.915]  And so once he committed, and saying the shot will help you and it's great and it's his greatest accomplishment, when his listeners boo him in Dallas, and in Cleveland, and in Florida, everywhere, when they boo him in Arizona, he quit promoting it.
[00:38:25.959 --> 00:38:33.582]  And said, I'm not supposed to say the V word, but I'm still really proud of it and it's great and it works, even though the Democrats and the left admit now it doesn't work.
[00:38:33.602 --> 00:38:34.903]  In fact, it gets you more infected.
[00:38:35.403 --> 00:38:38.064]  And so that's how Trump is.
[00:38:38.124 --> 00:38:39.644]  And I've gotten messages to Trump.
[00:38:39.724 --> 00:38:40.765]  I've gotten videos to Trump.
[00:38:41.425 --> 00:38:43.928]  I've got reports where I challenged him in the last three months to him.
[00:38:44.328 --> 00:38:48.453]  He called me, but he calls usually like one in the morning, so I've missed a few of his calls.
[00:38:49.314 --> 00:38:57.043]  And he told two people that met with him who brought him my ultimatum, my friendly two different ultimatums.
[00:38:57.083 --> 00:39:11.495]   One was like five minutes, one was about eight minutes, laying out the facts, showing him how They manipulated him showing him how he's going to get saddled with this and he can be a real hero like the Santas who got conned at first but you know it's now come out and said you shouldn't take the shot.
[00:39:11.535 --> 00:39:14.919]  The Surgeon General said it hurts children and it's all a big lie basically.
[00:39:15.619 --> 00:39:20.483]   As long as he Stops them trying to force on kids now and makes that an issue.
[00:39:21.163 --> 00:39:22.304]  We will forgive him.
[00:39:22.884 --> 00:39:25.485]  But if he continues down this road, it's very, very hard to support him.
[00:39:26.066 --> 00:39:29.467]  And he said, I don't want to hear about this again.
[00:39:30.368 --> 00:39:35.711]  And I don't and I don't want to basically hear from Alex again until he changes his mind.
[00:39:35.831 --> 00:39:36.711]  I'm right about this.
[00:39:37.232 --> 00:39:42.474]  And I've confirmed that he now screams at Don Jr.
[00:39:44.035 --> 00:39:47.898]  He screams at... behind the scenes, Trump has got a big temper.
[00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:52.941]  If you bring it up to him, he starts screaming and banging his fists on the table.
[00:39:53.342 --> 00:39:58.625]  And so he is pig-headed and totally committed to this because he doesn't want to admit he got conned.
[00:39:58.925 --> 00:40:00.527]  He doesn't want to admit he got manipulated.
[00:40:00.847 --> 00:40:04.970]  And that really is why people like Judge Henry Napolitano don't support Trump anymore.
[00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:06.290]  He means well.
[00:40:06.331 --> 00:40:07.972]  He's a good man, did a lot of great stuff.
[00:40:08.392 --> 00:40:11.854]  But he is somebody that will not admit when he's wrong.
[00:40:11.894 --> 00:40:12.735]  He just cannot do it.
[00:40:13.052 --> 00:40:22.638]  That's, you know, it reminds me of that expression that says it's easier to fool a man than it is to convince him that he's been fooled.
[00:40:23.398 --> 00:40:27.461]  You know, and it would be such a big person thing for him to say, you know what?
[00:40:27.661 --> 00:40:32.164]  I mean, Fauci himself and Birx have come out and Birx herself in her book.
[00:40:32.484 --> 00:40:34.365]  I mean, what a talk about self-incriminating book.
[00:40:34.405 --> 00:40:38.848]  I mean, where's the DOJ just arresting her from her book saying, yeah, we lied to the president.
[00:40:39.108 --> 00:40:39.829]  We made it up.
[00:40:39.929 --> 00:40:41.610]  That's exactly what I told Trump.
[00:40:42.524 --> 00:40:45.107]  That's what I relayed to him in a letter and two videos that I got.
[00:40:46.328 --> 00:40:47.749]  The first time he said, I don't want to hear about it anymore.
[00:40:47.769 --> 00:40:48.650]  The second time he blew up.
[00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:58.519]  I mean, I got, I've talked to well-known names that went in and showed him on an iPad these videos and he watched them at Mar-a-Lago and just blew up the second time.
[00:40:59.079 --> 00:41:00.080]  And what you said is so key.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:04.344]  That's what I said to him in the videos that are also public videos, you know, emergency message to Trump.
[00:41:04.725 --> 00:41:06.827]  I mean, there's several of them out there from a few months ago.
[00:41:07.972 --> 00:41:11.274]  One's from about four months ago, one's from about three months ago, and I just kind of gave up at that point.
[00:41:11.614 --> 00:41:14.115]  Because he's still doing good, getting some good Republicans elected and things.
[00:41:14.135 --> 00:41:15.216]  So I'm not going to war with Trump.
[00:41:15.276 --> 00:41:16.197]  It's just very, very sad.
[00:41:16.237 --> 00:41:17.577]  But what you said is key.
[00:41:17.617 --> 00:41:20.819]  I said, sir, the head of the CDC has come out and said she was wrong.
[00:41:21.159 --> 00:41:22.100]  Fauci said he's wrong.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:24.901]  They're getting ahead of it and rats leaving the sinking ship.
[00:41:25.342 --> 00:41:26.582]  Now they're asking for amnesty.
[00:41:26.622 --> 00:41:27.863]  I mean, that just happened.
[00:41:28.123 --> 00:41:29.524]  But see, he doesn't get it.
[00:41:29.544 --> 00:41:31.065]  And that's exactly what I told him.
[00:41:31.625 --> 00:41:43.581]  You know, he would be the forever generational hero if he came out and said, I listened to these people, they lied to me, and now that I know differently, here's what we need to do.
[00:41:43.982 --> 00:41:46.065]  You know, and that would change everything.
[00:41:46.425 --> 00:41:48.086]  His greatest strength is his greatest weakness.
[00:41:48.486 --> 00:42:01.855]  When they threaten him, you know, to not get out of UNESCO, and they threaten him to not turn on pipelines, and they threaten him to not control the border, and they threaten him to not, you know, get rid of the tariffs keeping American jobs, you know, overseas.
[00:42:02.455 --> 00:42:03.956]  These are internal tariffs and scams.
[00:42:04.657 --> 00:42:05.397]  He's great there.
[00:42:05.457 --> 00:42:08.799]  So it's his greatest strength and greatest weakness.
[00:42:09.991 --> 00:42:10.371]  Yeah.
[00:42:10.932 --> 00:42:14.254]  Sadly, with very powerful people, that's generally true.
[00:42:14.354 --> 00:42:18.457]  Speaking of powerful people, I want to go back to the World Economic Forum for a minute.
[00:42:19.278 --> 00:42:22.560]  Because there are a lot of people that, you know, we see on the front lines.
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:27.443]  Like, we see Fauci, we see, you know, Bill Gates, we see, you know, Klaus Schwab.
[00:42:28.004 --> 00:42:33.427]  And a lot of us, and I know you feel the same way, is like, they're just like the spokespersons.
[00:42:33.988 --> 00:42:36.610]  Who are the people behind the scenes pulling their strings?
[00:42:37.261 --> 00:42:39.706]  Do you have any insight into that from all of your connections?
[00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:42.130]  Yes.
[00:42:42.130 --> 00:43:05.769]   The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican
[00:43:05.769 --> 00:43:10.730]   victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine
[00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:16.369]   possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and
[00:43:16.369 --> 00:43:21.050]   the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible.
[00:43:21.494 --> 00:43:34.542]  What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[00:43:34.622 --> 00:43:43.388]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier, and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air.
[00:43:43.488 --> 00:43:49.872]  And what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[00:43:49.992 --> 00:43:51.353]  So continue to do it.
[00:43:51.433 --> 00:43:53.555]  Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:53.615 --> 00:43:55.397]  Go to the places like Save InfoWars.

[00:45:00.047 --> 00:45:10.047]   you know yesterday somewhere here in my stack I covered the rainbow dildo butt monkey
[00:45:10.047 --> 00:45:11.047]  Butt Monkey.
[00:45:11.047 --> 00:45:12.606]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:12.365 --> 00:45:15.447]  And I saw comments and things and people thinking I made that up.
[00:45:15.967 --> 00:45:17.128]  I didn't read half of it.
[00:45:17.508 --> 00:45:27.814]  The man had a fake penis on with a fake butt naked with a fake vagina hanging down like a turkey gobbler and fake women's breasts.
[00:45:27.914 --> 00:45:29.094]  I wouldn't even show it on air.
[00:45:29.555 --> 00:45:33.497]  And little kids came up and sat on the dildo at the library.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.042]  So, you see, it's worse than what I just told you.
[00:45:37.682 --> 00:45:38.783]  You want me to show it to you?
[00:45:38.963 --> 00:45:40.484]  Our TV stations will take us off air.
[00:45:40.824 --> 00:45:42.325]  It's not fit for adults to see.
[00:45:42.445 --> 00:45:44.206]  It's only good for five-year-olds!
[00:45:45.146 --> 00:45:48.669]  You think they're funding that on purpose because they're playing freaking games?
[00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:52.251]  These people ain't playing games!
[00:45:52.431 --> 00:45:53.872]  They're gonna kill everybody!
[00:45:55.273 --> 00:45:56.934]  I want them shut down.
[00:45:57.014 --> 00:45:57.814]  I want them silenced.
[00:45:57.894 --> 00:45:58.615]  I want them muted.
[00:45:58.635 --> 00:46:00.416]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:46:00.959 --> 00:46:11.926]  Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[00:46:12.447 --> 00:46:16.409]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[00:46:16.909 --> 00:46:20.852]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[00:46:20.872 --> 00:46:23.894]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[00:46:24.054 --> 00:46:31.494]   You see, the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[00:46:31.494 --> 00:46:35.492]   But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3, and then it's
[00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:40.034]   very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[00:46:40.034 --> 00:46:44.054]   So now it's more important than ever, because the winner's here, to take high quality vitamin
[00:46:44.054 --> 00:46:48.673]   D3, and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload

[00:47:02.693 --> 00:47:18.653]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:18.653 --> 00:47:24.653]  patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:47:23.427 --> 00:47:33.836]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:34.036 --> 00:47:36.658]  Who are the people behind the scenes pulling their strings?
[00:47:36.959 --> 00:47:39.761]  Do you have any insight into that from all of your connections?
[00:47:40.061 --> 00:47:40.381]  Yes.
[00:47:41.362 --> 00:47:43.364]  First and foremost, this global government.
[00:47:44.602 --> 00:47:47.303]  Well, there's really three power groups.
[00:47:47.923 --> 00:47:50.504]  There's the Anglo-American establishment, nothing to do with being white.
[00:47:50.624 --> 00:47:52.845]  It's just what the British-U.S.
[00:47:52.945 --> 00:47:54.746]  combined empire calls itself.
[00:47:55.466 --> 00:47:58.187]  Others like Anglo-American oil, it was BP and all the rest of it.
[00:47:59.527 --> 00:48:01.708]  And so you got that major power block.
[00:48:01.888 --> 00:48:03.349]  The British Empire merged the U.S.
[00:48:03.409 --> 00:48:05.990]  Empire after World War II.
[00:48:07.381 --> 00:48:07.841]  The U.S.
[00:48:07.861 --> 00:48:11.483]  became an empire after the Spanish-American War in 1898.
[00:48:11.883 --> 00:48:14.004]  For those that don't know, historians officially see it as that.
[00:48:14.384 --> 00:48:15.704]  So that's the dominant force.
[00:48:16.265 --> 00:48:25.328]  Then you've got the Russians that are a wild card, and you've got the Chinese that are allied, or were allied, with the Anglo-American establishment, but of their own predator group.
[00:48:26.749 --> 00:48:51.456]   And when you talk about who really runs it, it really is the old royalty of Europe, That is one breed, and they're not even German, they're mainly Eastern European, Hungarian, Romanian, because that's the folks, starting like 800 years ago, that stopped the Muslims and controlled the trade coming out of the caravans into Europe.
[00:48:52.637 --> 00:49:04.843]   So all the royal main lines of, I'm getting too complex, of Europe that actually run things are a mix of Eastern Europeans and Uh, William the Conqueror, Vikings.
[00:49:05.423 --> 00:49:17.607]  And so, a fusion of Vikings and Eastern Europeans created the main royal, Saxe-Coburg, Gotha, Habsburgs, they're all the same people, bloodlines, and they're dominant.
[00:49:17.707 --> 00:49:19.407]  The Rothschilds got involved in that.
[00:49:19.928 --> 00:49:24.749]  The British Empire, they intermarried, are now lords, so they've actually merged into that.
[00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:26.690]  The Rockefellers and the Carnegies.
[00:49:28.103 --> 00:49:40.040]   And the JP Morgans were just their front people here in the United States and setting up the whole Anglo-American merger and alliance that, by the way, not my opinion, he wrote three Books on it.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.222]  Winston Churchill wrote The History of the English-Speaking Peoples.
[00:49:43.362 --> 00:49:44.402]  And it's all in there, by the way.
[00:49:44.442 --> 00:49:47.204]  None of this is even hidden at, you know, academic-level reading.
[00:49:47.384 --> 00:49:49.204]  I read through all three of those books when I was in high school.
[00:49:49.445 --> 00:49:50.485]  They're incredible.
[00:49:50.505 --> 00:49:53.666]  In fact, I want to reread them if I have the time, because it's all right there.
[00:49:53.686 --> 00:50:00.049]  Cecil Rhodes, by 1900, already had a plan for a world government and how they were going to merge the U.S.
[00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.910]  and British Empire.
[00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:05.492]  They set up the Council on Foreign Relations to do that in 1921 at the Crowd House in New York.
[00:50:06.457 --> 00:50:15.999]  And so yes, Henry Kissinger, Zbigniew Brzezinski, people like Klaus Schwab, they're all just front people.
[00:50:16.778 --> 00:50:26.778]   And so at the top, it's these old, rich, powerful families who commissioned the British Royal Societies in the 1850s
[00:50:26.778 --> 00:50:32.018]   to learn how to take control of humanity and make humans a commodity,
[00:50:32.018 --> 00:50:36.137]   and then breed humans like animals, even if they were, and create a caste system.
[00:50:36.137 --> 00:50:39.179]  This is all Galton, Wedgwood, Darwin.
[00:50:39.179 --> 00:50:40.059]  They were all hired for that.
[00:50:40.059 --> 00:50:44.338]   It's all on record in the Eugenics Society and the founding of the modern eugenics movement.
[00:50:44.338 --> 00:50:48.818]   And they envisioned biometrics, computers, finding out the secrets of our cells
[00:50:48.818 --> 00:50:51.739]  before they called themselves.
[00:50:51.739 --> 00:50:53.998]  Their projects discovered DNA, everything.
[00:50:53.998 --> 00:50:59.619]   In the next 60, 70 years, they were able with this giant project to do that.
[00:50:59.466 --> 00:51:06.350]  And their main mission was figure out how to take control of all life on Earth, including humans, and learn how to discover immortality.
[00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:10.192]  That's obviously what the ultra-rich want, and how to basically become gods.
[00:51:10.513 --> 00:51:16.937]  And so out of the eugenic society that was embarrassed by Hitler in World War II, Hitler and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute were a spinoff of that.
[00:51:17.917 --> 00:51:47.001]   They then created the transhumanist society with Aldous Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley, And then once they had done that, basically everything you see is a projection of that, how to get control of humanity, how to turn us basically into these bots that if they decide we can survive, are basically programmable, so that the elites of the world that we hear Noah Yuval Harari, or Yuval Noah Harari talking about,
[00:51:47.662 --> 00:51:51.805]  That the future is not human, that's a quote.
[00:51:51.825 --> 00:51:53.966]  By 2047, there'll be no more humans left.
[00:51:54.287 --> 00:51:55.247]  We'll all be cyborgs.
[00:51:55.267 --> 00:51:56.248]  This is them saying this.
[00:51:56.268 --> 00:51:58.390]  We're going to have a digital dictatorship.
[00:51:58.970 --> 00:52:06.335]  We don't believe in Jesus, or we don't believe in Muhammad, or, you know, we don't believe in God, is a quote of his.
[00:52:06.395 --> 00:52:13.200]  But we're going to be gods, and Microsoft and Apple are going to be god, and the Italian elite are going to be god, and we won't be needed.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.481]  They're going to get rid of the rest of us.
[00:52:15.161 --> 00:52:27.419]   And so this is externalization of that transhumanist program that I expose in the seminal film Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement that can still be found, if you search hard enough, free online.
[00:52:28.119 --> 00:52:36.664]  Back when Google Video was still around in 2007 when we launched the film for free, it had 80 plus million views when they got rid of Google Video.
[00:52:37.184 --> 00:52:40.446]  Then it had about 40 million views on my main YouTube channel when they took it down.
[00:52:41.507 --> 00:52:43.528]  But you can still find some out there.
[00:52:43.548 --> 00:52:46.690]  Everybody's authorized to repost it and share it and do whatever you want with it.
[00:52:47.708 --> 00:52:53.523]  But if you watch that film from, I guess now, 10, 17 years ago, it hardly would have been that long.
[00:52:57.243 --> 00:52:58.565]  It's all basically come true.
[00:52:58.645 --> 00:53:03.329]  Well, that's because it was their battle plan that they were going from beta to operational right at that point.
[00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:06.613]  And so now they're accelerating into this operation.
[00:53:06.673 --> 00:53:19.505]  So, to sum up your all-important question, in the final equation, it is an alliance of old, powerful money that wants to live forever and become God, the Garden of Eden for real, and the promise of the serpent.
[00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:26.532]  Funding unlimited scientific research in every level there is.
[00:53:27.332 --> 00:53:52.209]   These groups actually financed what we know of as the whole genetic engineering arm, the computer arm, and the electromagnetic arm, and just this entire thing is a huge program that the Manhattan Project was only one one-hundredth of, in my estimation, A giant secret scientific program for the elite to live forever and become God.
[00:53:52.689 --> 00:53:58.312]  And in the process, from the beginning, they said we first must follow Malthus and Plato's ideas.
[00:53:58.672 --> 00:54:00.693]  Plato, 2,300 years ago.
[00:54:01.173 --> 00:54:02.534]  Malthus, 300 years ago.
[00:54:03.234 --> 00:54:11.958]  Of exterminating the majority of the public as our survival of the fittest, social Darwinistic toll.
[00:54:13.419 --> 00:54:22.029]  That it is their main tenet that we must first be cold to 500 million, bare minimum, before they can then transcend to the Godhead.
[00:54:23.524 --> 00:54:24.545]  Wow, yes.
[00:54:24.826 --> 00:54:25.907]  And I agree with all of that.
[00:54:25.987 --> 00:54:30.132]  And boy, that was a great way to lay that out in the history pattern, Alex.
[00:54:30.172 --> 00:54:34.798]  You know, this entire year, I spent this entire year on Genesis 6.
[00:54:35.639 --> 00:54:38.679]   you know on tuesday and thursday night i do an online bible study called happy
[00:54:38.679 --> 00:54:43.358]   hour with dr t and on tuesday night i invite authors and pastors and
[00:54:43.358 --> 00:54:46.157]   you know really people from that perspective and we talk about god and we
[00:54:46.157 --> 00:54:53.157]   have an online a bible study on tuesday and thursday night and we this entire year has been about genesis six
[00:54:53.157 --> 00:55:00.079]   and actually about genesis three verse fifteen where god cursed satan
[00:55:00.079 --> 00:55:03.798]   and said you in your seed satan in your seed
[00:55:03.798 --> 00:55:07.518]   will bruise his heel Her, the, her, his healing.
[00:55:06.649 --> 00:55:10.809]   heal, meaning Christ's heal, and Christ, Jesus, where it will come from that bloodline, the
[00:55:10.809 --> 00:55:14.049]  pure bloodline of the woman, will smash your head.
[00:55:14.049 --> 00:55:19.649]   And I mean, that is the whole summary of what we've done from the beginning of our time,
[00:55:19.649 --> 00:55:22.248]  that verse, that one verse, Genesis chapter 3, verse 15.
[00:55:22.248 --> 00:55:25.449]   And you're the doctor, you're the scientist, but I think you're talking about mitochondrial
[00:55:25.449 --> 00:55:26.449]  DNA.
[00:55:26.449 --> 00:55:29.929]   No matter what they try to manipulate with our DNA, we still will carry forward the real
[00:55:29.929 --> 00:55:30.929]  DNA.
[00:55:30.929 --> 00:55:38.569]   Yes, except for the messenger RNA now is slicing up our DNA and the sulfide bonds that across
[00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:43.249]  our DNA spells the word Yahweh from the Hebrew alphabet.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:48.682]  And the messenger RNA is going in and destroying that because they want to destroy God from the inside out.
[00:55:48.702 --> 00:55:52.502]   You know, when this first started in March of 2020, when I wrote that article,
[00:55:52.502 --> 00:55:55.762]   you know, same playbook, different virus, I also sort of looked up and I said,
[00:55:55.762 --> 00:55:57.301]  "Wow, we got to get busy here.
[00:55:57.301 --> 00:55:59.102]  This is Satan's last hurrah."
[00:55:59.102 --> 00:56:04.502]   You know, the Lord's coming back sooner than we think, just because he, you know, Jesus himself said,
[00:56:04.502 --> 00:56:07.261]   "Only the Father in heaven knows the day that I will come back,
[00:56:07.261 --> 00:56:10.142]  but you will know by the signs of the time.
[00:56:10.142 --> 00:56:16.421]   You will know as in the days of Noah, where they bred humans and animals and genetic modification."
[00:56:16.421 --> 00:56:20.541]   And like you mentioned, the humanized mice and the glow-in-the-dark pigs
[00:56:20.541 --> 00:56:24.902]   and all these different things that they're doing was what was happening as in the days of Noah
[00:56:24.902 --> 00:56:28.902]   when God came on earth and said, "Whoa, I made a mistake of this free will here."
[00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:36.511]   I repent that I even Even created humans, we need to erase the plan and start over again.
[00:56:37.012 --> 00:56:41.315]  So all of that stuff that we're doing, this is all good versus evil.
[00:56:41.435 --> 00:56:45.819]  It is all, you know, we are fighting powers and principalities of this greater darkness.
[00:56:46.179 --> 00:56:47.600]  You know, it's not human against human.
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:52.884]  It's like the evil that's upon this planet that we've been fighting since the Garden of Eden, actually.
[00:56:53.285 --> 00:57:03.093]   And we're coming up to that point of actually all these things are being exposed and it's becoming It's getting clearer and clearer that there's going to be less and less gray area to pick from.
[00:57:03.393 --> 00:57:04.434]  It's a black or white.
[00:57:04.634 --> 00:57:10.018]  Either you're on board with God and Jesus and you're on board with that or you're not.
[00:57:10.218 --> 00:57:13.821]  And it's almost like you've got your foot on one foot on the deck and the other foot on the boat.
[00:57:13.921 --> 00:57:15.523]  The boat's kind of moving this way.
[00:57:15.543 --> 00:57:22.749]  And you've got to either get on the safe, safe over here on the dock or you're going to get on the boat and go with God.
[00:57:23.169 --> 00:57:30.651]   Because if you fall in the middle, there's And notice that the devil always creates a counterfeit of
[00:57:30.651 --> 00:57:31.812]  what God says.
[00:57:31.812 --> 00:57:34.412]  The devil loves to quote scripture but to twist it.
[00:57:34.412 --> 00:57:54.412]   We're not backed by the Republican Party, by the Democratic Party, by George Soros,
[00:57:54.412 --> 00:57:58.612]   by Bill Gates, by Pfizer, by the ADL, by the New World Order, by nobody but you.
[00:57:59.036 --> 00:58:03.260]  So the media makes fun of Roger Stone selling t-shirts and signed stones.
[00:58:04.061 --> 00:58:05.121]  Well, we go to the people.
[00:58:05.462 --> 00:58:06.503]  It's a badge of honor.
[00:58:07.662 --> 00:58:14.268]  It's a badge of how we're grassroots, that we fund ourselves with books and films and high-quality supplements and things that you need.
[00:58:14.849 --> 00:58:24.198]  And so, please, if everybody would pray for the broadcast, everybody would share the videos and articles, if everybody would buy the products, we could change the whole world even faster and better.

[00:59:45.952 --> 00:59:52.512]   3 3 1 3 9 massive news sponsored by you brought the world by you
[00:59:52.512 --> 01:00:09.592]   Yuval Harari came out two weeks ago and said the elites are gonna get rid of
[01:00:09.592 --> 01:00:14.311]   humanity we don't need you and they're creating a Noah's Ark using all the
[01:00:14.311 --> 01:00:17.512]  science and systems for a breakaway civilization.
[01:00:17.512 --> 01:00:27.512]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:00:18.672 --> 01:00:25.798]  To go underground and off-world, and humanity is going to fall away like booster rockets as we go to heaven.
[01:00:26.219 --> 01:00:35.767]  And so again, we see Satan literally fulfilling prophecy, but telling his followers that they're actually going to be saved.
[01:00:36.828 --> 01:00:43.320]   How did a book written 2,000 years ago, or a book written 4,000 years ago, How is it all coming true?
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:44.560]  Because it's real.
[01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:50.804]  And if you go to the Sumerian text, at the same time the Jews are writing what they said, it's exactly the same thing.
[01:00:51.384 --> 01:01:10.615]  And it states it, and they know it, and mainline archaeologists say, well, that was the cosmology of the Sumerians, who are right there in the Euphrates area there, in what is Iraq today, where those rivers come together, where there's all that great farmland, where they found all those ancient civilizations.
[01:01:11.195 --> 01:01:17.724]  They say these entities came down and manipulated the genetics of humans and then everything got destroyed.
[01:01:18.224 --> 01:01:22.350]  So whatever people think it is, but the globalists know this.
[01:01:22.590 --> 01:01:27.110]   Like take the movie Prometheus, which is the prequel to Alien.
[01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:32.349]   And then I was reading where the director said, oh, this is what I really believe.
[01:01:32.349 --> 01:01:34.550]  And then that's what most of the globalists believe.
[01:01:34.550 --> 01:01:36.509]  They know evolution didn't happen.
[01:01:36.509 --> 01:01:42.469]   They know that you don't have a bunch of sand or a bunch of salt water and suddenly you get a cell
[01:01:42.469 --> 01:01:44.910]  that has billions of working parts.
[01:01:44.910 --> 01:01:46.390]  That's all just made up.
[01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:52.108]   And so they all know full well what's going on and they've got a project to become God
[01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:56.949]   just as the serpent said in the garden, eat of this apple, this knowledge,
[01:01:56.949 --> 01:01:58.709]  and you will then try to be God.
[01:01:58.925 --> 01:02:01.166]  And so I would call it the God project.
[01:02:01.506 --> 01:02:05.429]  They're trying to build this into themselves being God.
[01:02:05.449 --> 01:02:09.331]  They're in a rebellion against God, but we are made in the image of God.
[01:02:10.356 --> 01:02:17.138]  Little G, when we follow God's plan, then there's a long-term program for communion with God, you know, as we go to the next level.
[01:02:17.378 --> 01:02:18.599]  That's in God's program.
[01:02:18.839 --> 01:02:21.920]  But Satan says, no, I've got a shortcut for you over here.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:32.183]  But, well, you have to kill most of the people and have pedophilia and world government create all these abominations in the process, which are all affronts to God that are all meant to hurt God.
[01:02:32.203 --> 01:02:35.004]  Because God loves us all more than we love our children.
[01:02:35.304 --> 01:02:36.404]  Because we are God's children.
[01:02:36.724 --> 01:03:04.743]   And so God gave us free will because God Gave us that great gift just like a man and woman have a child even though they know one day that child's gonna die or You know that child might be in a car wreck or might get cancer You still love each other so much you want that child to love them you you give birth to them because you instinctively spiritually know it's an eternal spirit and that body is only one manifestation in this dimension of what's gonna happen and this isn't taught in the mainline churches, but it was taught by the ancients it was taught by the Hebrews and
[01:03:05.263 --> 01:03:24.877]  This is all there in the Bible, but again, in the last 200 years, I had some of the globalist proto-organizations go in and take control of the churches and basically dumb it down so that people aren't seeing how the Bible is literally an owner's manual, literally a survival manual, because I don't want to say God cheated.
[01:03:25.822 --> 01:03:30.485]  But God gave us free will, but also said, hey, don't play in the street.
[01:03:30.865 --> 01:03:32.066]  And this is how you should operate.
[01:03:32.086 --> 01:03:33.067]  This is how you should work.
[01:03:33.147 --> 01:03:33.687]  And I'm here.
[01:03:33.707 --> 01:03:35.068]  And I'm here to hold your hand.
[01:03:35.508 --> 01:03:37.549]  And when the Holy Spirit comes, that's God trying to hold your hand.
[01:03:37.770 --> 01:03:42.633]  Now, if you pull away and don't want to have God direct you, then that's what got God, God, God's very sad.
[01:03:42.653 --> 01:03:43.233]  And that happens.
[01:03:43.633 --> 01:03:44.774]  So that's really where we are.
[01:03:45.114 --> 01:03:46.535]  It is an owner's manual.
[01:03:46.735 --> 01:03:48.175]  God gave us ownership of the planet.
[01:03:48.495 --> 01:03:50.216]  You know, Satan's in control of it via fraud.
[01:03:50.236 --> 01:03:55.337]  If we just reach, you know, into our destiny and connect to God, we'll be given total dominion over the earth.
[01:03:55.718 --> 01:03:56.818]  Yes, the devil's gonna come.
[01:03:57.158 --> 01:03:58.318]  Yes, he's gonna have a short time.
[01:03:58.619 --> 01:04:02.580]  But it's the saints that are gonna battle this and create the fertile ground.
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:12.645]  For when he gets his limited one year, or two years, or three years, depending on how you analyze it, of power, out of that comes the greatest revival ever, and then Satan's defeat.
[01:04:13.025 --> 01:04:23.711]  He's gonna act real friendly and real nice, and have cures to this, and cures to that, and signs and wonders, and then as soon as he doesn't get exactly what he wants, he's gonna get away with killing one-fourth of the planet.
[01:04:24.131 --> 01:04:24.652]  They wanna kill 80%.
[01:04:25.772 --> 01:04:26.073]  Okay?
[01:04:26.453 --> 01:04:31.079]  So, so, but, but, and if God doesn't intervene, no flesh will be spared.
[01:04:31.199 --> 01:04:34.683]  You, in your lifetime, there's no doubt, we'll witness it, folks.
[01:04:34.943 --> 01:04:37.366]  But it's up to us to battle as hard as we can.
[01:04:37.827 --> 01:04:41.091]  At a certain point, Satan will overcome the saints for a very short period.
[01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:42.853]  So he's gonna win an inning.
[01:04:43.353 --> 01:04:44.294]  Satan's gonna win an inning.
[01:04:44.875 --> 01:04:46.356]  And a lot of us are going to get killed in the process.
[01:04:46.376 --> 01:04:47.276]  That's okay, we're eternal.
[01:04:47.656 --> 01:04:50.498]  We're going to win the brass ring, folks, okay?
[01:04:50.518 --> 01:04:53.099]  We're going to get the crown, we're going to throw it at God's feet, and I don't even want it.
[01:04:53.339 --> 01:05:05.339]   But I'm telling you, we're going to win the baseball game at the end.

[01:07:15.097 --> 01:07:20.343]  And one that it says that the t-shirts that I wear at the airport it says faith over fear on the t-shirt.
[01:07:20.443 --> 01:07:26.269]  I always wear that when I go to the airport and I kind of I wear like a sweatsuit and I have that underneath.
[01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:29.012]  I get so many comments and so people looking.
[01:07:29.072 --> 01:07:32.997]  It's like a way to like tell your faith to the world and encourage people.
[01:07:33.137 --> 01:07:34.839]  Faith over fear as we move forward.
[01:07:35.439 --> 01:07:42.763]  So during our Deep Dive interviews, we have a personal conversation with our guests about what inspires them and find out a little bit more personally about who they really are.
[01:07:43.063 --> 01:07:46.865]  So for today's Deep Dive guest, really needs no introduction.
[01:07:46.905 --> 01:07:55.009]  And if you missed our This Week with Dr. T interview for Monday morning, you really need to go back and listen to it because, wow, we covered a lot of things.
[01:07:55.389 --> 01:07:59.751]  So let me introduce to you my friend, my longtime colleague, Alex Jones.
[01:08:00.332 --> 01:08:15.159]   Born and raised in Texas, Alex Jones cuts through the lies of the globalist official narrative With unrivaled analysis that has simultaneously led him to becoming the most talked about, the most reviled, and the most censored name in broadcasting.
[01:08:15.499 --> 01:08:26.364]  Beginning with his first show in Austin, Texas in the 1990s, he's built a media empire with over 400 radio and cable television stations, hundreds of online streaming platforms, and international syndication.
[01:08:26.805 --> 01:08:33.408]  His new book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, Alex exposes the World Economic Forum's agenda.
[01:08:33.908 --> 01:08:37.210]  He has dedicated the last 30 years of his life to studying the Great Reset.
[01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:45.015]  And if you listen to our first interview, you know it goes even further back than that, way back into his childhood with family members that he talked about these things.
[01:08:45.436 --> 01:08:54.742]  And he's conducted tens of thousands of interviews of top-level scientists, politicians, military officials, and even me, in order to reverse-engineer the secrets that help awaken America.
[01:08:55.683 --> 01:09:03.248]  Alex possesses three traits the globalists have worked tirelessly to stamp out of the masses in order to create permanent underclass.
[01:09:04.008 --> 01:09:09.450]  Being well-read, having a really good memory, and caring about others.
[01:09:10.010 --> 01:09:13.832]  Alex, welcome to the Deep Dive with Dr. T. It's great to be here.
[01:09:13.892 --> 01:09:17.694]  Thank you so much over the years for coming on my show, and I love coming on yours.
[01:09:17.994 --> 01:09:19.034]  You're doing such a good job.
[01:09:19.054 --> 01:09:21.835]  That's why the system is coming after you so bad right now.
[01:09:21.895 --> 01:09:24.556]  So people should really, really be proud of the work you've done.
[01:09:24.977 --> 01:09:25.857]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:09:25.897 --> 01:09:27.878]  And yeah, they're like hot on my tail.
[01:09:29.039 --> 01:09:35.968]  And you know what, but it's sort of like, you know, I kind of look at it like, well, you know, it's what I'm here to do, and it's sort of like you.
[01:09:36.028 --> 01:09:40.293]  I mean, the system's been hot on your tail for the last, you know, year or two.
[01:09:40.373 --> 01:09:43.497]  The more successful you are fighting this evil, the more they come after you.
[01:09:43.517 --> 01:09:46.782]  So we know what we got into, and, you know, God's watching.
[01:09:47.282 --> 01:09:47.882]  Absolutely.
[01:09:48.363 --> 01:09:54.125]  Well, with all of my Deep Dive guests, because this is an interview that we don't usually do very often.
[01:09:54.185 --> 01:09:59.367]  We don't really usually pull back the curtain and find out more about who these people are.
[01:09:59.407 --> 01:10:00.908]  Like, who is Alex Jones?
[01:10:01.328 --> 01:10:05.049]  So let's start with where you were born and what was your childhood kind of like?
[01:10:05.069 --> 01:10:08.531]  And when you went to college, how did you decide to go into broadcasting?
[01:10:09.773 --> 01:10:12.818]  Well, I mean, I can tell the whole story.
[01:10:12.838 --> 01:10:15.001]  It'll take a long time, but just the basics is this.
[01:10:15.241 --> 01:10:19.087]  I was born in Dallas, and I grew up in a suburb outside Dallas, Rockwall.
[01:10:20.286 --> 01:10:31.838]  And I had my mom's brother that had worked in clandestine operations, was a really great guy, he died a few years ago, who basically educated me early on how the world worked.
[01:10:31.859 --> 01:10:35.162]  I had a lot of other family that was also very well read.
[01:10:35.182 --> 01:10:40.408]  I was a jock, but at the same time I, very early on, liked comic books and science fiction.
[01:10:41.367 --> 01:10:42.967]  and I was a really good reader.
[01:10:42.967 --> 01:10:47.606]   So I was reading, you know, like a 12th grade level when I was 10 years old.
[01:10:47.606 --> 01:10:48.447]  Wow.
[01:10:48.447 --> 01:10:53.667]   And so I started reading history books just because they were so interesting.
[01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:58.686]   And so I read hundreds and hundreds of history books by the time I was out of high school.
[01:10:58.686 --> 01:11:01.386]  And then I didn't know what I wanted to go to college for.
[01:11:01.386 --> 01:11:05.527]   And so I thought, well, I'll just take some community college and take a wide range of courses
[01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:06.766]  and see what I like.
[01:11:06.766 --> 01:11:09.287]   And I went to Austin Community College for about a year and a half.
[01:11:09.287 --> 01:11:15.985]   And I had jobs and things was already doing well and like sales at a gym.
[01:11:16.892 --> 01:11:21.837]  So I was seeing how I was already making more money than the so-called professors there at the school.
[01:11:21.857 --> 01:11:25.120]  So that kind of woke me up when I was, you know, like 19 years old.
[01:11:25.860 --> 01:11:31.205]  And then I just noticed no matter what class I was in, whether it was Texas history or U.S.
[01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:36.290]  history or whether it was the math classes or whatever it was, because when you first go to college, you take these basics.
[01:11:37.711 --> 01:11:58.181]  It was all very anti-American, and then I went and sat in on some UT classes, because I was thinking about enrolling there, and it was even more anti-American, and I went and looked at their RTF operation, because I was thinking about getting into radio, television, film, because I wanted to talk about American freedom, because of the tearing I saw in the colleges, and they were teaching stuff in RTF then that was 10 years behind.
[01:11:58.201 --> 01:12:10.801]   It wasn't anything about the internet, nothing about all these things I knew about, and so I thought, you know, I've got a job in sales, and I'm doing better than most people with college degrees.
[01:12:10.821 --> 01:12:13.943]  And I said, I think I'll just, you know, not go to college.
[01:12:14.323 --> 01:12:16.344]  And I was about 20 years old then.
[01:12:16.364 --> 01:12:19.646]  And then I began to watch AXS TV in Austin.
[01:12:19.726 --> 01:12:21.427]  That's where AXS TV actually began here.
[01:12:21.827 --> 01:12:24.529]  Had very nice studios, a lot of hosts, a big audience.
[01:12:25.369 --> 01:12:37.786]   And so I would see People on there playing G. Edward Griffin clips and Ted Gunnarson clips and talking about the New World Order and, you know, things like that and the massacre at Waco.
[01:12:39.067 --> 01:12:41.829]  And I knew these people were really smart, knew what they were talking about.
[01:12:41.909 --> 01:12:48.675]  So I went and visited my uncle in San Antonio and I said, you know, I think I'm going to do an AXS TV show and I think I'm going to fight the New World Order.
[01:12:48.695 --> 01:12:50.116]  He said, that's a great idea.
[01:12:50.156 --> 01:12:53.419]  So I started the AXS TV show, sort of going down there.
[01:12:53.458 --> 01:12:56.377]  there's only a few classes you had to take in late '94.
[01:12:56.377 --> 01:12:59.118]  In '95, sort of being a guest on some of the shows.
[01:12:59.118 --> 01:13:05.137]   In '96, in a control room, going live an hour, three or four nights a week, there's plenty of air time.
[01:13:05.137 --> 01:13:10.538]   I was one man show with a camera in there punching up the show, having it go live,
[01:13:10.538 --> 01:13:12.978]  and really an electronic soapbox.
[01:13:12.978 --> 01:13:18.337]   And after about a year of that, a local radio station was switching over to talk radio
[01:13:18.337 --> 01:13:24.759]   from rock and roll, and the program director saw me and said, hey, would you like a Saturday night show?
[01:13:24.093 --> 01:13:25.875]  Come in this Saturday and do two hours live.
[01:13:26.275 --> 01:13:35.403]  Well, they just launched the talk radio, and they had Howard Sterns, Jordan Liddy, a bunch of other big people, but they had a few local shows during the week that they launched that weren't getting any calls.
[01:13:35.723 --> 01:13:38.926]  Well, when I went on that first night, they had 10 phone lines.
[01:13:39.406 --> 01:13:42.347]  And I'd have to scream the calls myself during the break, you know, just get their name and write it down.
[01:13:42.367 --> 01:13:50.450]  They had a board op running things, but I was even taking my own calls because they wanted me to at least get their name instead of just punching them up like I did on AXS TV.
[01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:53.151]  Had calls as well, just, you know, hit the buttons and people were there.
[01:13:53.191 --> 01:13:54.932]  Prank callers, regular callers, you name it.
[01:13:55.912 --> 01:14:02.334]  And so there I was a year after being on AXS TV, hosting a Saturday night show that went from two hours to three hours.
[01:14:02.834 --> 01:14:05.135]  And then ratings came in in a few months and had high ratings.
[01:14:05.175 --> 01:14:06.436]  They gave me a Sunday night show, too.
[01:14:07.677 --> 01:14:09.679]  About six months later, they gave me a weeknight show.
[01:14:10.900 --> 01:14:14.523]  It got higher ratings than Howard Stern and G. Orton Liddy.
[01:14:15.504 --> 01:14:15.884]  Wow.
[01:14:16.325 --> 01:14:17.366]  And the big lineup they had.
[01:14:17.386 --> 01:14:19.467]  And they said, well, show's not going to pay you, kid.
[01:14:19.547 --> 01:14:20.228]  I was doing it for free.
[01:14:20.248 --> 01:14:22.070]  I said, well, can I become a salesman?
[01:14:23.131 --> 01:14:28.615]  And so by the time I was 21, 22, I was already one of the top salesmen at a big talk radio station.
[01:14:29.296 --> 01:14:32.339]  And I was already, you know, making a couple hundred thousand dollars a year.
[01:14:33.587 --> 01:14:35.470]  And I thought, I want to make films.
[01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:37.413]  This is by 1996-97.
[01:14:37.854 --> 01:14:39.256]  I said, I want to show my listeners.
[01:14:39.297 --> 01:14:42.502]  Not just have a newsletter or a coffee mug or a t-shirt like most talk show hosts have.
[01:14:43.023 --> 01:14:43.984]  I said, I want...
[01:14:45.071 --> 01:14:47.172]  To actually show people stuff.
[01:14:47.192 --> 01:14:55.557]  So on weekends, I'd fly places, shoot interviews, show things that were going on, the UN taking over the national parks, the signs they put up, things like that.
[01:14:56.397 --> 01:14:58.939]  And I made my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:14:59.639 --> 01:15:03.621]  It became an underground mega hit with people making copies of the VHS tapes.
[01:15:04.202 --> 01:15:07.984]  And I came out with DVDs, and I subsequently made more than 20 documentaries.
[01:15:08.024 --> 01:15:16.735]   But by 1998, I said, I want to be syndicated. So I actually reached out to syndicators,
[01:15:16.735 --> 01:15:20.974]   met with a few big national syndicators and then they said, you know, you're too
[01:15:20.974 --> 01:15:27.044]   hardcore. Then I reached out to a small satellite uplink company and I said, I just want to pay,
[01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:31.935]   put myself on satellite, only like four thousand dollars a month, but would go to
[01:15:31.935 --> 01:15:32.835]  main receivers.
[01:15:32.804 --> 01:15:40.804]   And then I personally then hired a PR firm when I was like 25, 26 years old
[01:15:40.804 --> 01:15:45.923]   to call 2,000 talk stations and send them a packet of information.
[01:15:45.923 --> 01:15:59.923]  [Music]
[01:15:59.923 --> 01:16:02.724]  Let's see what's cooking Auntie Thief!
[01:16:02.861 --> 01:16:09.004]  Thanksgiving Day is coming, and for Charlie Brown, that can only mean... It's a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.
[01:16:09.024 --> 01:16:13.146]  I'll tell you, Pat, this stuff is looking good, and smelling good, and tasting good.
[01:16:13.446 --> 01:16:15.327]  We gotta dig in and start eating now.
[01:16:17.047 --> 01:16:18.628]  Oh, girl, what a feast this is!
[01:16:18.688 --> 01:16:22.930]  This is beautiful, girl!
[01:16:22.789 --> 01:16:23.789]  Nice!
[01:16:23.789 --> 01:16:24.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:24.789 --> 01:16:25.789]  Gotcha, turkey!
[01:16:25.789 --> 01:16:26.789]  Gotcha!
[01:16:26.789 --> 01:16:27.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:27.789 --> 01:16:28.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:28.789 --> 01:16:29.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:29.789 --> 01:16:30.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:30.789 --> 01:16:31.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:31.789 --> 01:16:32.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:32.789 --> 01:16:33.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:33.789 --> 01:16:34.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:34.789 --> 01:16:35.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:35.789 --> 01:16:36.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:36.789 --> 01:16:37.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:37.789 --> 01:16:38.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:38.789 --> 01:16:39.789]  Give me that!
[01:16:39.789 --> 01:16:40.789]  Hey!
[01:16:40.789 --> 01:16:41.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:41.789 --> 01:16:42.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:42.789 --> 01:16:43.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:43.789 --> 01:16:44.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:44.789 --> 01:16:45.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:45.789 --> 01:16:46.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:46.789 --> 01:16:47.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:47.789 --> 01:16:48.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:48.789 --> 01:16:49.789]  (audience laughs)
[01:16:49.789 --> 01:16:51.789]   The turkeys are hitting the ground like sands of wet cement!
[01:16:52.582 --> 01:16:57.884]  I don't know how much longer the crowd is running for their lives.
[01:16:57.984 --> 01:17:00.385]  Thanks for that on-the-spot report, boss.
[01:17:00.785 --> 01:17:11.597]   For those of you who just tuned in, the Pinedale Shopping Mall has just been bombed with lots Hey buddy.
[01:17:11.637 --> 01:17:18.859]  You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.
[01:17:19.039 --> 01:17:24.460]  You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant.
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:33.603]  Don't let him kill me!
[01:17:33.803 --> 01:17:35.664]  I'm too young to die!
[01:17:35.924 --> 01:17:39.385]  Look, I had a chance to shoot a bunch of you the other day and didn't.
[01:17:42.199 --> 01:17:44.821]  He wants to get rid of Thanksgiving forever!
[01:17:45.261 --> 01:17:47.763]  To get rid of the Thanksgiving Day Parade!
[01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:49.344]  All right, Spider-Man!
[01:17:49.545 --> 01:17:52.127]  He's got spiderweb rays coming out of his hands.
[01:17:52.287 --> 01:17:53.808]  He can cling to tall buildings.
[01:17:54.168 --> 01:17:56.390]  And he's looking for Octopus, the green goblin.
[01:17:56.610 --> 01:17:57.531]  Ranji to O.J.
[01:17:57.591 --> 01:17:57.911]  O.J.
[01:17:57.931 --> 01:18:00.373]  running to the left, turns the corner at the 30.
[01:18:00.533 --> 01:18:00.813]  O.J.
[01:18:00.873 --> 01:18:02.234]  at the 25, the 20, and falls ahead of the 15.
[01:18:02.294 --> 01:18:04.436]  That says that he broke the record.
[01:18:04.456 --> 01:18:10.060]  Mr. Quentin Longley, even if he never completes another pass, they'll always remember the one he threw on Thanksgiving Day 1974.
[01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:12.962]  Where's the turkey, Chuck?
[01:18:13.342 --> 01:18:15.784]  Don't you know anything about Thanksgiving dinners?
[01:18:15.804 --> 01:18:24.771]  Those aren't pillows.
[01:18:25.112 --> 01:18:29.112]  As God is my witness, I thought turkeys could fly.
[01:18:29.112 --> 01:18:31.112]  [laughter]
[01:18:31.112 --> 01:18:33.112]  [applause]
[01:18:33.112 --> 01:18:39.112]  [music]

[01:20:01.667 --> 01:20:08.667]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.667 --> 01:20:25.667]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news.
[01:20:26.145 --> 01:20:31.145]  Today, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:31.145 --> 01:20:41.465]   I hired a PR firm when I was like 25, 26 years old to call 2,000 talk stations and send them
[01:20:41.465 --> 01:20:43.225]  a packet of information.
[01:20:43.225 --> 01:20:48.024]   So the key was I spent the money I was making in sales and the money I made off the DVD
[01:20:48.024 --> 01:20:55.545]   and the VHS tapes that was then over a million dollars to hire a PR firm to send out packets
[01:20:55.545 --> 01:20:57.344]  to all the talk radio stations.
[01:20:57.344 --> 01:21:05.145]   And I instantly, in 1998, got over 100 radio affiliates and was now doing this show out
[01:21:05.145 --> 01:21:06.585]  of a local station.
[01:21:07.247 --> 01:21:08.767]  But suddenly it got national news.
[01:21:08.827 --> 01:21:09.787]  I got attacked some.
[01:21:10.367 --> 01:21:13.628]  The station fired me because they got political pressure.
[01:21:13.988 --> 01:21:15.168]  But I already figured that was coming.
[01:21:15.208 --> 01:21:16.529]  So I already built a studio in my house.
[01:21:17.469 --> 01:21:23.350]  And so by the year 2000, I had close to 200 radio affiliates out of a bedroom at my house.
[01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:24.210]  I was then married.
[01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:26.591]  My wife was pregnant with our first child.
[01:21:27.551 --> 01:21:27.971]  And so...
[01:21:29.108 --> 01:21:33.452]  I was not even 30 years old, and it was on over 200 radio stations.
[01:21:34.552 --> 01:21:36.414]  And I was on shortwave and a lot of other stuff.
[01:21:36.954 --> 01:21:43.339]  And so 9-11 came around, and I really thought it was an inside job, or the radical Muslims had help.
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:45.001]  We talked about the bombs in the buildings.
[01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:49.725]  So I went from hundreds of stations to about 40 stations in the space of a month.
[01:21:50.225 --> 01:21:51.326]  But I didn't back down.
[01:21:51.346 --> 01:21:53.087]  I didn't censor myself.
[01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:56.190]  And then that really exploded the show in the underground.
[01:21:56.990 --> 01:22:03.453]  Uh, and then over the years, we built it back up to over 400 radio stations, and it's just been a long, you know, hard battle.
[01:22:04.073 --> 01:22:07.995]  I took almost all the money that I made on films.
[01:22:09.235 --> 01:22:17.120]  and DVD sales and tried to build a news media infrastructure, launch a nightly news program, hire another talk show host in the last 14 years.
[01:22:18.361 --> 01:22:26.986]  And then, of course, social media exploded in the last decade and we became the biggest show, even bigger than Joe Rogan is today, by about six years ago.
[01:22:27.406 --> 01:22:30.308]  So then they came in with the debanking, with the platforming to try to shut us down.
[01:22:30.707 --> 01:22:39.626]   We survived because we're on platforms like Infowars.com and being on talk radio and some cable and TV stations.
[01:22:39.626 --> 01:22:43.306]   And then over the last four years, the attack we finally built back
[01:22:43.306 --> 01:22:45.667]  to about half the audience we had then.
[01:22:45.667 --> 01:22:51.926]   And so it's really been a Nietzschean journey of that which does not kill you, only makes you stronger.
[01:22:51.926 --> 01:22:56.867]   And all glory goes to God and the Holy Spirit and God working through the listeners and viewers.
[01:22:56.867 --> 01:23:01.086]   Because Lord knows, you know, some days I do six to eight hours of broadcasting
[01:23:01.086 --> 01:23:05.807]   and sometimes it's a train wreck 'cause it's teleprompter free and I'm a wild man.
[01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:13.443]  But it's been a learning process, and every mistake I made, I would redo it now if I could, except it was a learning process that made me who I am today.
[01:23:13.823 --> 01:23:17.043]   So I could see God putting pressure on me, God teaching me,
[01:23:17.043 --> 01:23:22.002]   but only giving me what I can handle at the time so that I would be ready and battle hardened
[01:23:22.002 --> 01:23:26.963]   for the incredible stress and attacks that I've now entered, which I've now learned are actually blessings
[01:23:26.963 --> 01:23:28.403]  and are actually enjoyable.
[01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:30.202]  And 10 years ago, I couldn't have handled this.
[01:23:30.202 --> 01:23:34.283]   Five years ago, I couldn't have handled it, but it was all God, like taking the sword
[01:23:34.283 --> 01:23:37.722]   and beating it in like, that's just a Vulcan,
[01:23:37.722 --> 01:23:42.383]   you know, there under the volcano into something that can now,
[01:23:42.383 --> 01:23:45.043]   isn't perfected, isn't perfect, isn't even that great,
[01:23:45.043 --> 01:23:49.002]   but has been through so many angles of attacks and been through so many,
[01:23:49.002 --> 01:23:53.423]   you know, globalist operations that now instead of a sword,
[01:23:53.423 --> 01:23:57.483]   InfoWars is more like a skeleton key that can open any door with our guests,
[01:23:57.483 --> 01:24:00.963]   our researchers, our callers, our ability to make things go viral,
[01:24:00.963 --> 01:24:03.563]  our ability to stay afloat despite all the attacks.
[01:24:03.864 --> 01:24:06.034]  All of it was God's plan from the beginning.
[01:24:06.154 --> 01:24:06.898]  None of it was me.
[01:24:07.279 --> 01:24:07.942]  I was just willing.
[01:24:09.448 --> 01:24:13.429]  Wow, that's a great story on all different levels, Alex.
[01:24:13.449 --> 01:24:21.050]  I mean, such a great inspirational story of entrepreneurship that I think that people really need to hear stories like that, like yours.
[01:24:21.090 --> 01:24:29.412]  You know, that of how you just moved from one thing to another and you didn't give up and you took advantage of opportunities that were set in front of you.
[01:24:29.432 --> 01:24:30.392]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:33.532]  I mean, God doesn't give us what we can handle.
[01:24:33.933 --> 01:24:36.093]  He helps us handle what we've been given.
[01:24:36.713 --> 01:24:39.196]  And I think that's a really important lesson.
[01:24:39.236 --> 01:24:40.217]  I'll say that again.
[01:24:40.277 --> 01:24:41.898]  God doesn't give us what we can handle.
[01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:45.161]  He helps us to handle what we've been given.
[01:24:45.642 --> 01:24:47.604]  When did your walk with the Lord start?
[01:24:49.997 --> 01:24:59.521]  You know, I mean, my parents, we went to church on Wednesday nights and Sundays, and my parents are, you know, serious Christians, but never really pushed it hard on me.
[01:25:00.522 --> 01:25:13.007]  And then I saw a lot of occultism and corruption in Dallas, and then my dad sold some dental offices he owned and moved to Austin, because that had always been the goal, because my mom's from Austin, and my parents met at UT, so they always wanted to get here.
[01:25:14.248 --> 01:25:17.269]  And once I got here, it was more new-agey and weird, and I...
[01:25:19.941 --> 01:25:25.286]  I guess I fell away from God when I was in junior high and high school.
[01:25:26.627 --> 01:25:30.350]  Dallas, where I went to school, was pretty rough compared to the way things are today.
[01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:31.250]  People didn't shoot each other.
[01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.911]  They got in fights.
[01:25:32.431 --> 01:25:33.332]  So I was in a lot of fights.
[01:25:33.392 --> 01:25:36.394]  I wasn't a bully, contrary to what CNN has gone back and made up stories about.
[01:25:36.815 --> 01:25:39.057]  But I did get in a lot of fights, and I did get proud of myself.
[01:25:39.717 --> 01:25:43.659]  So then, you know, everybody wants to fight the guy that, you know, has won all these fights or whatever.
[01:25:43.699 --> 01:25:46.480]  So I got in a lot of fights, got arrested a few times.
[01:25:47.921 --> 01:25:51.282]  And I never started the fights, but I got arrested, you know, for putting people in the hospital and stuff.
[01:25:51.903 --> 01:26:03.968]  And then I moved to Austin and I had quite a few girlfriends because I finished up a couple years of high school in Austin.
[01:26:04.748 --> 01:26:11.631]   And my dad When I was living at home, I saw the bill in my room for an abortion.
[01:26:12.752 --> 01:26:16.215]  And he said to me, he said, you know, I don't want you to kill my grandchildren.
[01:26:16.795 --> 01:26:19.617]  He said, you really shouldn't do that.
[01:26:19.637 --> 01:26:21.018]  You ought to control yourself.
[01:26:21.859 --> 01:26:27.243]  And later in life, you're going to wish you hadn't been part of this, because I'd pay for some abortions.
[01:26:28.324 --> 01:26:29.685]  But he just happened to see that bill.
[01:26:31.008 --> 01:26:39.716]  And he already knew because a girlfriend was around about a year before, and I guess she confided in my mother that she'd had an abortion.
[01:26:39.736 --> 01:26:46.602]  You know, they'd come and they didn't want to tell their parents or whatever, and they'd be like a 16, 17-year-old girl, and they'd go have an abortion.
[01:26:47.023 --> 01:26:49.885]  My dad said, you really need to stop killing my grandchildren.
[01:26:50.846 --> 01:26:53.588]  And I still kept doing what I was doing for a while.
[01:26:54.563 --> 01:27:02.729]  And then I really started having nightmares about it, and really feeling a spirit of evil attacking me, and that I had some important work I was going to do.
[01:27:02.749 --> 01:27:09.494]  It was the Holy Spirit, and that God wasn't going to help me, and that I wasn't going to be happy if I didn't, you know, stop doing what I was doing.
[01:27:10.455 --> 01:27:23.705]  And so, for a few years, I stopped dating, and was already working out and stuff, but I got really into shape, started exercising, started reading the Bible more, started watching C-SPAN and getting really into politics again and history.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:31.646]  And I remember my mother walking in when I was like 18, about to move out to high school, and she goes, I haven't seen a girl here in about a year.
[01:27:31.666 --> 01:27:32.347]  Are you gay?
[01:27:32.687 --> 01:27:38.052]  Because it went from like all the beauty queens at the house, and I was really good looking back then, to like no women around.
[01:27:38.072 --> 01:27:39.253]  My mom goes, what the hell's going on?
[01:27:39.273 --> 01:27:41.975]  And so I moved out.
[01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:49.260]  I started dating some girls and, you know, kind of getting back into it, but then they'd get upset if you wouldn't go right to bed with them.
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:55.609]  And so for about a year and a half I was pretty much celibate and just got back into politics.
[01:27:56.860 --> 01:28:06.969]  And then literally, it was like the Holy Spirit was, you've got to fight the New World Order, you've got to engage these people, you've got to go challenge these people, you've got to do what your uncle talked about, you've got to resist them.
[01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:13.355]  And then in community college, I was seeing it all, and so it was like, there's this mission, and you've got to do this, and you've got to challenge these people.
[01:28:13.415 --> 01:28:23.184]  And so, I was like 19 going to city council meetings, I hadn't been able to find any video of it, and county commissioner meetings, getting in their face about taking farmer's land for environmental land grabs.
[01:28:23.684 --> 01:28:25.325]  I'm trying to pass gun control and things.
[01:28:25.625 --> 01:28:28.047]  So I was involved years before I got on air.
[01:28:29.147 --> 01:28:33.290]  And then, again, I started the AXS TV show.
[01:28:33.330 --> 01:28:42.255]  And about six months into it, right before I got the call to be on talk radio, I was sitting in a restaurant by myself at night after I'd done like a two-hour show on AXS TV.
[01:28:43.236 --> 01:28:44.437]  And almost nobody's in the restaurant.
[01:28:45.097 --> 01:28:49.560]  And I remember, I'm sitting there drinking iced tea and eating a chicken fried steak.
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:53.400]  And it was like the whole future opened up.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:29:00.400]  [Music]
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:07.380]   One of the biggest news stories lately has been Elon Musk purchasing Twitter at the hopes, for many, that free speech
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:09.400]  would be restored on the platform.
[01:29:09.837 --> 01:29:17.760]  Elon Musk has hinted at this himself, but when he spoke out against returning Alex Jones to the platform, there were obvious concerns.
[01:29:18.201 --> 01:29:28.685]  Now, what I think might be going on, Elon Musk is making a business decision knowing that if Alex Jones is allowed back on the platform, Twitter might get removed from the App Store.
[01:29:28.744 --> 01:29:30.784]  "Oh, you can't have it on your iPhone.
[01:29:30.784 --> 01:29:33.305]  "Oh, you can't have it on your Android anymore."
[01:29:33.305 --> 01:29:41.625]   And now that one of the head tech executives and app manufacturers at Apple has removed his account,
[01:29:41.625 --> 01:29:43.604]  could be a sign of things to come.
[01:29:43.604 --> 01:29:48.904]   Now others think it might be a personal choice that Elon Musk made to not let Alex Jones
[01:29:48.904 --> 01:29:50.264]  back on the platform.
[01:29:50.264 --> 01:29:55.824]   Now here was Alex Jones' response to the news of Elon Musk not reinstating his account.
[01:29:55.824 --> 01:30:00.984]   The ADL and the Southern Primary Law Center, the Democratic Party and the European Union
[01:30:00.984 --> 01:30:05.944]   and the Justice Department and CIA moles that Congress had hearings on last week
[01:30:05.944 --> 01:30:14.404]   are inside of his company right now and are literally trying to sabotage it,
[01:30:14.404 --> 01:30:19.864]   not just externally with threats of lawsuits and censorship and criminal charges from the EU,
[01:30:19.864 --> 01:30:25.423]   but they're also threatening to sabotage the company and the actual systems that make it operate.
[01:30:25.423 --> 01:30:26.984]  So--
[01:30:26.658 --> 01:30:32.823]  He hit the panic button and basically came out and attacked me so that he can get the left off of his back.
[01:30:33.484 --> 01:30:40.931]  And you know, it's fine to me that he did that, except he went too far and compared himself to Jesus and the whole...
[01:30:41.807 --> 01:30:42.728]  Bring the children to me.
[01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:44.150]  Suffer the children to me.
[01:30:44.170 --> 01:30:50.879]  And if you offend one of these, if you're mean to one of these kids, it's better for you to kill yourself by tying a big bowl to your neck and throw it in the ocean.
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:52.401]  That's just outrageous.
[01:30:52.441 --> 01:30:56.907]  That's absolutely outrageous that I'm supposedly the worst guy in the world because of media hype.
[01:30:57.708 --> 01:31:00.931]  That massively has misrepresented what I really said about Sandy Hook.
[01:31:01.151 --> 01:31:07.856]  If Elon loves to quote Christ so much in between dressing up like Satan, he should quote Christ's most famous quote.
[01:31:08.637 --> 01:31:11.019]  Let he without sin cast the first stone.
[01:31:11.239 --> 01:31:13.881]  But that story will carry itself out.

[01:32:57.609 --> 01:33:08.849]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.849 --> 01:33:17.568]  [Music]
[01:33:17.213 --> 01:33:21.336]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:22.077 --> 01:33:23.558]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.979 --> 01:33:26.000]  Our love is unconditional.
[01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:29.323]  We knew it from the start.
[01:33:31.284 --> 01:33:33.266]  I see it in your eyes.
[01:33:34.227 --> 01:33:36.609]  You can feel it from my heart.
[01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:52.359]   From here on after, let's stay the way we are right now And share all the love and laughter, that a lifetime will
[01:33:52.359 --> 01:34:01.590]   allow I cross my heart and promise you...
[01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:04.590]  And it was like the whole future opened up.
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:12.288]  Not the exact future, but it was like a metaphysical moment where I was at another level for about an hour in the back of this restaurant.
[01:34:13.587 --> 01:34:16.950]  Sitting there and it was like you're going to you're going to take on the new world order.
[01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.971]  It's going to be huge.
[01:34:18.632 --> 01:34:26.219]  You're absolutely you're going to be the guy that triggers all these other leaders that are going to come forward that are going to be part of defeating this but.
[01:34:27.119 --> 01:34:29.102]  You have to understand you're going to get destroyed in the end.
[01:34:29.222 --> 01:34:30.603]  And it's going to be very painful.
[01:34:30.984 --> 01:34:32.025]  And it's going to not be fun.
[01:34:32.045 --> 01:34:34.909]  And I remember like, I've never been in the presence of something like that.
[01:34:34.929 --> 01:34:35.970]  I didn't see Christ.
[01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:36.871]  I didn't see an angel.
[01:34:36.931 --> 01:34:40.356]  I was like, like this down low, you know, that people like David Ike talk about.
[01:34:40.376 --> 01:34:44.861]  And I was just like, for like an hour and a half, like this dinner, like in the restaurant going.
[01:34:45.482 --> 01:34:46.704]  What in the world's going on here?
[01:34:46.724 --> 01:34:53.411]  And it was this sense of completion and absolute like knowing confidence beyond confidence.
[01:34:53.892 --> 01:34:58.197]  And I remember just driving home and just like at the top of my head had blown off.
[01:34:58.677 --> 01:35:00.399]  And it was like this is a mission.
[01:35:00.900 --> 01:35:01.621]  You're doing this.
[01:35:01.721 --> 01:35:06.594]   And at that point, I was like, that was outside of me. This is real. And I was
[01:35:06.594 --> 01:35:12.243]   like commissioned at that point. And in that moment, it was like God was telling me and you stop
[01:35:12.243 --> 01:35:15.903]   killing the kids and you're not, and you're not going to do that now. And then right after
[01:35:15.903 --> 01:35:21.143]   that, I met my wife, started dating her, got her pregnant. We got married and had my son Rex, who's
[01:35:21.143 --> 01:35:25.064]   20 years old now, or more than 20 now, Tom Flies.
[01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:28.586]  And so, that's basically my experience with God.
[01:35:28.646 --> 01:35:34.931]  But the, being involved in the abortion, I didn't, I was lying to myself, it's not a human, it's just flesh, just a blob of tissue.
[01:35:35.391 --> 01:35:37.573]  I was convicted by the Holy Spirit about it.
[01:35:37.673 --> 01:36:04.830]   First convicted by my dad, then convicted by the Holy Spirit by it, and then I stopped the sin, and then literally that allowed the transmission and the connection to God, but that had to be removed, because before that was happening, I was I was, and I don't want to say depressed, but dark forces were pushing energy at me and trying to push me off what I was supposed to do because the devil's not omnipresent, but the devil has foresight into the future.
[01:36:05.210 --> 01:36:11.692]  And so there was definitely a interdimensional spiritual whirlpool going on around me at that time.
[01:36:11.772 --> 01:36:17.413]  And I needed God to actually get out of that whirlpool because you're either with God or you're with the devil.
[01:36:18.433 --> 01:36:20.033]  And so that's basically what happened.
[01:36:21.061 --> 01:36:25.222]  And since then, I'm assuming your walk with the Lord, actually with Jesus, has gotten better?
[01:36:26.543 --> 01:36:28.063]  Yeah, I mean, I'll be completely honest.
[01:36:28.743 --> 01:36:29.803]  I mean, I go off and on.
[01:36:30.023 --> 01:36:31.164]  I have a problem with alcohol.
[01:36:31.184 --> 01:36:34.545]  I also have a problem, not with family so much, but with anger.
[01:36:34.565 --> 01:36:44.707]  And if I work too much and drink too much caffeine and stuff, I can, I wouldn't call them psychotic breaks, but I mean, I definitely can turn into a monster.
[01:36:45.528 --> 01:36:48.188]  And I've gotten really good in the last, you know, four or five years not doing it.
[01:36:50.609 --> 01:37:00.794]  But that's also my walk with God, is that I realized I would get mad that I couldn't beat the Globalist myself, and I believe in God, believe in Jesus, and had discernment in the Holy Spirit, but I was still trying to do it myself.
[01:37:01.414 --> 01:37:06.637]  And it's only been the last four or five years I learned to turn it loose, and not get so mad about what they're doing.
[01:37:06.677 --> 01:37:15.721]  I'm still mad about it, but go, it's up to God, it's God's plan, and I have to have some level of detachment, or when you stare into the abyss, as Nietzsche says, you become the abyss.
[01:37:16.281 --> 01:37:23.290]   So I have to, like, make sure that I don't Focus on the enemy too much or ever hate them because then that hate becomes you.
[01:37:23.310 --> 01:37:30.318]  I have to realize that they're fallen, they're garbage, they're evil and just protect the good people and just cut them off and not even think about them.
[01:37:31.089 --> 01:37:31.409]  Wow.
[01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:33.170]  Wow, Alex.
[01:37:33.290 --> 01:37:43.297]  Well, you know, you've been on this journey for a long time and you've got incredible research on your own, you've got a great research team, and you've interviewed thousands of people.
[01:37:44.298 --> 01:37:50.122]  And you got introduced to this whole, you know, New World Order, this whole thing very early on.
[01:37:50.282 --> 01:37:57.566]  And in this entire journey, has there been a couple of things along the way that have been really shocking or surprising to you?
[01:37:57.586 --> 01:38:01.549]   I mean, things that You know, you kind of went, oh my, I never expected that.
[01:38:03.191 --> 01:38:23.846]  Yeah, I mean, I grew up, when I was like five, we moved from Dallas, like Central Dallas on White Rock Lake, to Rockwall, that was like a bedroom community then, but the richest county in Texas then, with a bunch of private airfields and helicopter fields and money.
[01:38:24.827 --> 01:38:35.609]   And so it was a paradox of like, You know, it had the black projects in it in downtown, the old town, and then it had all these rich people that lived out in the country and the hills around it.
[01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:37.750]  It's a hilly area, kind of like Austin.
[01:38:38.471 --> 01:38:39.451]  Most of Dallas is flat.
[01:38:40.192 --> 01:38:41.232]  And it's on Lake Ray Hubbard.
[01:38:42.053 --> 01:38:48.656]  And I was shocked that there was a lot of Satanism going on.
[01:38:49.177 --> 01:38:55.459]   And not just what you think of as like, You know, white trash in your backyard, sacrificing a dog on Halloween.
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.900]  I mean, real Luciferian type stuff.
[01:38:58.721 --> 01:39:01.962]  And I can tell some of those stories, but it just gets into how weird my life's been.
[01:39:02.302 --> 01:39:03.383]  Now that was God preparing me.
[01:39:03.963 --> 01:39:06.164]  That I never engaged in the Satanism itself.
[01:39:07.185 --> 01:39:09.686]  But I lost my virginity when I was 12.
[01:39:09.766 --> 01:39:11.206]  I looked like I was 16 when I was 12.
[01:39:11.667 --> 01:39:13.287]  And when I was 16, I looked like I was 25.
[01:39:13.768 --> 01:39:15.028]  And so, you know, I'm 48 now.
[01:39:15.468 --> 01:39:16.189]  And so I...
[01:39:17.088 --> 01:39:21.828]   I like girls that were a little bit older, like 16 years old.
[01:39:21.828 --> 01:39:23.927]  And I definitely liked it.
[01:39:23.927 --> 01:39:25.488]  So I became very promiscuous.
[01:39:25.488 --> 01:39:29.828]   And so then I got roped in by some of the girls that were seniors in school.
[01:39:29.828 --> 01:39:33.828]   I was a freshman in high school and then even college women and then other stuff.
[01:39:33.828 --> 01:39:42.068]   And then it became very apparent with with three or four of the women who were in rich
[01:39:42.068 --> 01:39:45.849]   families that they would try to get me inducted into Luciferianism.
[01:39:45.858 --> 01:39:48.498]  And it was actually an actual cult operating out there.
[01:39:48.518 --> 01:39:49.299]  I didn't understand that.
[01:39:49.319 --> 01:39:57.261]  So that's one of the reasons my dad sold his dental offices and actually moved to Austin, which I ran into no Satanism down here.
[01:39:57.281 --> 01:39:58.821]  It was more New Age stuff and hippie stuff.
[01:39:59.361 --> 01:40:09.244]   But that area of Rockwall had a very rich, powerful, A group of occultists going on, similar to what's in Monterio and the Russian River.
[01:40:09.284 --> 01:40:10.705]  California has the same group.
[01:40:11.705 --> 01:40:12.786]  There's a big one in New York.
[01:40:13.666 --> 01:40:19.829]  There's a big satanic group in Pennsylvania, also in Omaha, Nebraska, San Francisco.
[01:40:20.869 --> 01:40:29.012]  And so that kind of primed me early on that, you know, some girl picks you up in her $100,000 Mercedes and you're 14 years old.
[01:40:33.633 --> 01:40:36.354]  And, uh, you know, you go to her mansion, you're having sex with her.
[01:40:36.894 --> 01:40:39.935]  And then a week later, you know, she invites you to her house.
[01:40:40.215 --> 01:40:48.797]  And, and it's, and I mean, literally one of these houses was a castle, a castle in the country, and the helicopter pads and, you know, airfield and everything.
[01:40:49.437 --> 01:40:55.819]  And, you know, in, in, in come these rich parents and they're literally saying, Hey, you know, we want you to join this cult.
[01:40:56.219 --> 01:40:57.479]  You know, you like having sex with my daughter.
[01:40:57.499 --> 01:41:05.921]   Uh, so I, I got immediately like, They tried to put me immediately into one of the higher levels of these feeders.
[01:41:06.581 --> 01:41:11.644]  Most people get into the occult, they go join a satanic church and they're in it for years and never make it into the inner rings of it.
[01:41:12.064 --> 01:41:16.587]  But I bypassed the stepping stones, they tried to put me right into it.
[01:41:17.588 --> 01:41:22.010]  And so again, my big challenge was, my big temptation was sex.
[01:41:22.551 --> 01:41:28.134]  And I'm saying once I transcended that, when I was about 19, that's when my main mission started.
[01:41:29.116 --> 01:41:39.664]  Wow, that's pretty shocking, at that early age, that you were not only able to not get involved with it, but to kind of walk away from it.
[01:41:41.225 --> 01:41:43.307]  Well, it was like a wall.
[01:41:44.168 --> 01:41:48.011]  At the point that that happened those times, there was like a wall.
[01:41:48.131 --> 01:41:52.754]  But because I didn't fully reject it, I was still demonically influenced.
[01:41:57.128 --> 01:42:12.574]  I mean, I'd beat people to, uh, the, you know, I mean, I, I would, people, like, people start fighting me, like, they were obviously attracted to me because I would, like, beat up full-grown men and stuff, and it was, it was not good, and it was definitely satanic, but the point is, I got out of it, I was never officially in it, but I was spiritually influenced by it.
[01:42:12.954 --> 01:42:17.796]  So let's just say this, I've been very blessed to be somebody that got on Satan's railroad for a while, but got off the train.
[01:42:18.276 --> 01:42:24.799]  But I, I now see back that that was all part of God's process, because if I didn't see all that early on, I wouldn't be ready for it now.
[01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:27.532]  Well, that's a true statement.
[01:42:27.592 --> 01:42:35.804]  I mean, you know, our whole life sort of, you know, we were both born for a time such as this and all of our previous experiences have kind of gotten us to this place.
[01:42:36.324 --> 01:42:41.203]   So as you move on to the end of your life, Alex, how do you want to be remembered?
[01:42:41.203 --> 01:43:03.125]   Ladies and gentlemen, I've been studying the Globalists for more than 30 years,
[01:43:03.125 --> 01:43:08.724]   and I have tracked the fact they're obsessed with keeping the general population of the planet,
[01:43:08.724 --> 01:43:14.083]   particularly America, from producing our own free market solutions and ideas.
[01:43:14.314 --> 01:43:16.596]  They want monopolies over the economy.
[01:43:17.057 --> 01:43:25.804]  And we saw that in the last three years, blocking therapeutics, blocking scientists and researchers that expose the truth about COVID and its origins or its treatment.
[01:43:26.545 --> 01:43:36.654]  And there have been so many great telephonic sites and organizations and groups that popped up with the therapeutics that saved potentially millions of lives, bare minimum hundreds of thousands.
[01:43:36.994 --> 01:43:52.284]   But now, the platinum standard of medical doctor researcher, Dr. Peter McCullough, working with other top doctors From around, not just the U.S., but Canada and around the world, have come up with OnlineHealthNow.com, the wellness company.
[01:43:52.664 --> 01:43:54.024]  So it's a one-stop shop.
[01:43:54.544 --> 01:44:05.588]  So when they take over Big Pharma, when Big Pharma takes over local medicine, the answer is going to doctors, going to organizations and groups that actually care about you and aren't working with the power structure.
[01:44:05.968 --> 01:44:07.169]  That's how free market works.
[01:44:07.769 --> 01:44:19.113]  And it's so important, believe me, my own life, my family's life, that I had patriot doctors and telephonic medicine during the heat of the pandemic that saved members of my family's life.
[01:44:19.673 --> 01:44:22.354]  And I felt like I was dying, I think saved my life.
[01:44:22.734 --> 01:44:30.975]   But now, the platinum standard of this, Dr. Peter McCullough, is heading up a major organization to bring this revolution to the general public.
[01:44:30.975 --> 01:44:33.255]  So this is a revolutionary act, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:44:33.255 --> 01:44:39.015]   Take control of your health freedom today at onlinehealthnow.com with the wellness company.
[01:44:39.015 --> 01:44:42.375]   Dr. Peter McCullough, spend a few minutes telling us about the revolutionary action.
[01:44:42.375 --> 01:44:47.895]   Alex, thanks for introducing the most positive development we've seen now in decades.
[01:44:48.117 --> 01:44:55.784]  For the last three years, we've had continuance of fear and dark news day by day by day.
[01:44:55.804 --> 01:44:59.227]  It's so wonderful to bring you a positive solution.
[01:44:59.267 --> 01:45:06.233]  The Wellness Company, we have tremendous physician leadership, wonderful e-commerce support staff.
[01:45:06.793 --> 01:45:12.556]  I have a website that is second to none, a cell phone app, and it's up and running.
[01:45:12.897 --> 01:45:47.863]   This alternative health care system has uncensored content, virtual appointments with doctors, other health care providers, and integrates with community pharmacies, your local laboratory and in vitro diagnostics, imaging companies, treatment packages, real expertise in acute and post-COVID syndrome, vaccine injury syndromes, all your usual Primary care needs, certainly handling prescription needs on demand, and then has holistic products in an online store, including nutraceuticals and supplements, all in one package.
[01:45:48.384 --> 01:45:51.447]  The Wellness Company for a low monthly price.
[01:45:52.168 --> 01:45:58.471]  Each and every one of you are invited to join this nationwide platform and get assistance when you really need it.
[01:45:58.531 --> 01:46:05.315]  Let's never have a situation with COVID-19 like we had where people could not get access to care.
[01:46:05.695 --> 01:46:07.636]  I'm so proud to be a part of this new venture.
[01:46:08.076 --> 01:46:14.800]  This is exactly what we need so we're not sucker punched when they try the next viral release at one of their labs.
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:17.121]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[01:46:17.562 --> 01:46:19.183]  OnlineHealthNow.com.
[01:46:19.243 --> 01:46:24.666]  I had dozens of other great telephonic groups and organizations on that did a great job in the last three years.
[01:46:25.067 --> 01:46:29.470]  But now you guys are creating an umbrella group, bringing everybody together and taking it to the next level.
[01:46:29.890 --> 01:46:31.151]  Everybody should bookmark it.
[01:46:31.351 --> 01:46:31.851]  You should call.
[01:46:31.871 --> 01:46:32.712]  You should sign up today.
[01:46:32.732 --> 01:46:44.883]   Because not just the prescriptions, not just the meetings, not just the diagnostics, Not just meeting with the doctors and others, but the amount of free information and the studies and the reports and the facts, the information is a brain trust.
[01:46:45.263 --> 01:46:49.287]  Now more important than ever with all the big tech censorship we're seeing over our health.
[01:46:49.688 --> 01:46:51.069]  Onlinehealthnow.com.
[01:46:51.330 --> 01:46:52.551]  Thank you so much, Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:46:52.751 --> 01:46:54.751]  Thank you.
[01:46:54.751 --> 01:47:01.751]  [Music]
[01:47:01.751 --> 01:47:08.751]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.751 --> 01:47:20.751]  [Music]
[01:47:20.670 --> 01:47:27.670]   Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:27.670 --> 01:47:38.670]   So as you move on to the end of your life Alex, how do you want to be remembered?
[01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:50.753]  I didn't used to care how I was remembered, but now I know how the globalists operate, like they've done with the whole, I won't even say the name of it, Connecticut stuff, where I barely ever covered the internet questioning it, literally 24 minutes in all those years before they sued me.
[01:47:51.173 --> 01:48:03.716]  Then six years after they sued me, they now admit a top PR firm that does the PR for the UN out of New York said, we're going to run against Trump with Alex Jones the last two months of the 26th campaign.
[01:48:04.841 --> 01:48:06.362]  By the 2016 campaign.
[01:48:07.162 --> 01:48:14.765]  And we're going to build him up as this guy that did all this stuff he didn't do, because he's the archetype of the populist resistance.
[01:48:15.165 --> 01:48:19.987]  So we can capture him and not have him as an icon of populist folk hero resistance, as they said it.
[01:48:20.367 --> 01:48:20.988]  It's now come out.
[01:48:21.008 --> 01:48:22.568]  I'm going to call myself that.
[01:48:22.588 --> 01:48:23.309]  That's how they saw it.
[01:48:23.889 --> 01:48:26.650]  And we can turn him into this horrible bully of children and this mean guy.
[01:48:26.670 --> 01:48:27.830]  Then we can default him.
[01:48:28.371 --> 01:48:30.432]  Then we can have a judge say I'm guilty.
[01:48:30.452 --> 01:48:32.532]  And then we can create this false archetype.
[01:48:32.552 --> 01:48:42.774]   So it's very important That they not be able to capture the Alex Joneses, the Sherry Tenpenny's, or the Tucker Carlson's of the world with the fake creature they create.
[01:48:42.794 --> 01:48:44.577]  Because they don't just create a straw man.
[01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:51.956]  They make that fake straw man who you are, and then don't just use that currently, they then use that to rewrite history in the future.
[01:48:52.376 --> 01:49:03.926]  That's why it's important to try to be as healthy as I can, to be on air as long as I can, show that as they're in live time trying to rewrite history that I'm this horrible person, people understand that it's bigger than me just saying, oh, Alex Jones was right.
[01:49:04.546 --> 01:49:08.668]  We're used to, I would like, just didn't even want to... I don't want to be arrogant.
[01:49:08.688 --> 01:49:09.369]  It's not about me.
[01:49:09.389 --> 01:49:11.570]  Because if you make it about ego, it actually weakens you.
[01:49:11.650 --> 01:49:15.892]  But now I see myself as a symbol that I need to be better on air.
[01:49:15.912 --> 01:49:19.494]  Because I make mistakes and I need to be more steadfast because I'm an example.
[01:49:19.774 --> 01:49:21.635]  But also, they've made a false example.
[01:49:21.735 --> 01:49:27.398]  Once they de-platform you on all their platforms, they can create whatever they want you to be and basically steal your identity.
[01:49:28.298 --> 01:49:31.702]  And so that's why how people remember is important.
[01:49:31.742 --> 01:49:51.538]   I want to be remembered as somebody that was pro-human, pro-God, pro-family, that stood up against evil, and that had a great effect, and to be an example to others in the future who are going to face their own trials and tribulations, to understand that Satan's in control of this planet, but God's in control of the universe that made you, and it's going to be the animating contest of liberty and this challenge that's gonna really,
[01:49:51.538 --> 01:49:53.179]  really make you who you are.
[01:49:53.179 --> 01:49:55.279]  And so you're not gonna be happy serving the system.
[01:49:55.279 --> 01:49:56.918]  You're not gonna be happy being a sellout.
[01:49:56.918 --> 01:50:02.198]   You're gonna be happy in the animating contest of liberty and you shouldn't expect to change the world overnight
[01:50:02.198 --> 01:50:04.858]   by yourself, but just little things like being a good father
[01:50:04.858 --> 01:50:07.599]   or a good mother, being a good boss or being a good employee,
[01:50:07.599 --> 01:50:13.759]   you know, having a garden, caring about your neighbors, visiting old people, you know, with a, you know,
[01:50:13.759 --> 01:50:19.319]   with an animal at the nursing home, you know, just putting light into the world is the right thing to do.
[01:50:19.319 --> 01:50:20.479]  And it's what we need to do.
[01:50:20.479 --> 01:50:25.639]   And so many good people that love God are ashamed in God's presence, the Holy Spirit,
[01:50:25.639 --> 01:50:27.878]   and know that we're sinners and they never wanna do anything
[01:50:27.878 --> 01:50:28.757]  because we're not perfect.
[01:50:28.757 --> 01:50:30.158]  Well, God knows you're not perfect.
[01:50:30.158 --> 01:50:31.918]  I'm certainly wasn't perfect.
[01:50:31.918 --> 01:50:39.438]   And so, but God has helped transform me 90% away from the point I was at.
[01:50:39.352 --> 01:50:43.735]  And, and, and, and, and so now overall, I don't even, you know, speed anymore in my car.
[01:50:44.095 --> 01:50:48.519]  And so it's all just a process of becoming better and better because we're an example to others.
[01:50:48.859 --> 01:50:50.120]  And it's not because we're Pharisees.
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:53.163]  It's not because we have all the answers, but it's because people see us as leaders.
[01:50:53.443 --> 01:50:54.403]  We need to live up to that.
[01:50:54.424 --> 01:51:05.210]   And people also don't have to understand that when they, Defend Info Wars, or defend free speech, or defend others under persecution, that that's what the enemy can't stand, because if they can pick off our leaders, they're going to win.
[01:51:05.250 --> 01:51:13.915]  So I just want to be remembered as somebody that really was a straight shooter, and really did tell the truth, and really did try to be as honest as I could.
[01:51:13.955 --> 01:51:18.757]  I've made mistakes, but I've never been this cunning, evil, manipulative mastermind they claim.
[01:51:19.037 --> 01:51:20.558]  They project who they are onto me.
[01:51:20.938 --> 01:51:23.460]  I've actually just been trying to tell the truth and swinging for the fences.
[01:51:24.558 --> 01:51:25.398]  That's really good.
[01:51:25.899 --> 01:51:28.039]  I forgot to ask you, do you have any siblings?
[01:51:29.780 --> 01:51:33.401]  My mother got sterilized by the Dalkon Shield IED.
[01:51:34.262 --> 01:51:34.682]  Oh, wow.
[01:51:35.242 --> 01:51:39.304]  When my dad was finishing up medical school, she wanted to have a bunch of kids.
[01:51:39.364 --> 01:51:42.545]  I only throw that out there because that's the system that they knew, by the way, to sterilize people.
[01:51:43.045 --> 01:51:45.126]  And she actually got a settlement from that, but she'd rather not have the money.
[01:51:45.146 --> 01:51:45.966]  She'd rather have more children.
[01:51:46.346 --> 01:51:52.028]  And so when I was 14, they adopted my sister from Korea, who was an orphan when she was about a year old.
[01:51:52.448 --> 01:51:55.069]  And she's my sister, even though she's not blood.
[01:51:55.129 --> 01:51:57.109]  She's just as much blood as not.
[01:51:57.410 --> 01:52:02.391]  And so I have one sister, Marley Jones, and she's an awesome person.
[01:52:02.891 --> 01:52:04.192]  And so that's who I have.
[01:52:04.412 --> 01:52:07.193]  For that, I have some great cousins and some great folks.
[01:52:07.233 --> 01:52:10.514]  But yeah, my mom certainly would have liked to have more children, and I wish I did.
[01:52:10.834 --> 01:52:11.594]  I have four children.
[01:52:12.154 --> 01:52:22.880]  I have three children with my ex-wife, who's a nice person, but kind of got psychologically colonized by the system, but I care about her and hope she does well.
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:31.084]  And I have three children that have lived with me since that divorce happened eight years ago, but two of them are moved out now.
[01:52:32.025 --> 01:52:39.809]  And then I have a five-year-old daughter with my great, wonderful wife, Erica, and so I've got four children.
[01:52:40.422 --> 01:52:42.124]  Oh wow, that's great.
[01:52:42.284 --> 01:52:47.030]  So that's, I mean, that's a big, that's a big span between, you know, what did you say?
[01:52:47.070 --> 01:52:48.813]  He's older than 20 into five.
[01:52:49.353 --> 01:52:52.737]  So, you know, God bless you on both ends of your life, you know, with children.
[01:52:52.757 --> 01:52:54.840]  That's really a great, that's really good.
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:55.681]  I mean, I look back.
[01:52:56.962 --> 01:53:02.267]  On the children I killed, not knowing it, and I would, I just have nightmares about my children having problems now.
[01:53:02.287 --> 01:53:06.830]  I just, every time I see my daughter get in the car and drive off with my wife, I worry about traffic and wrecks.
[01:53:07.250 --> 01:53:10.473]  And I just, just literally, my heart aches for my children loving them.
[01:53:10.973 --> 01:53:15.717]  And it's just, that's why they don't want you to ever have kids, so you would never imagine how precious they are.
[01:53:16.197 --> 01:53:23.026]   And the fact that I was lied to and deceived by the system, you know, to have paid for I don't know, six, seven abortions over the years.
[01:53:23.386 --> 01:53:27.728]  But people harden their hearts when they do that and say, I love it, I love abortion.
[01:53:27.768 --> 01:53:27.928]  No.
[01:53:28.488 --> 01:53:29.229]  Soften your heart.
[01:53:29.589 --> 01:53:31.309]  Know you made a mistake, you were lied to.
[01:53:31.390 --> 01:53:33.651]  Don't commit to it once you know it's murder.
[01:53:34.531 --> 01:53:37.512]  Then God, I really think, sees that as the ultimate sin.
[01:53:37.952 --> 01:53:39.933]  And that's why the left now says, of course it's a kid.
[01:53:40.013 --> 01:53:41.114]  Kill that little creature.
[01:53:42.034 --> 01:53:45.536]  They've really gone from it's a blob of tissue to, yeah, we kill kids, we love it.
[01:53:45.916 --> 01:53:47.277]  That's really their mainline statement.
[01:53:47.297 --> 01:53:47.857]  They wear shirts.
[01:53:48.257 --> 01:53:49.279]  How many abortions they've had?
[01:53:49.299 --> 01:53:53.545]  I think really abortion is the heart of the undermining of our country and our world.
[01:53:53.565 --> 01:53:58.753]  If we don't value our children, then God's not going to value us and we're cheapening human life.
[01:53:59.234 --> 01:54:05.213]   And so I think, with me, abortion was the breaking point with the devil, even though I wasn't consciously
[01:54:05.213 --> 01:54:06.134]  with the devil.
[01:54:06.134 --> 01:54:09.134]   And so for so many other people who've hardened their hearts,
[01:54:09.134 --> 01:54:12.734]   and I know most of your audience didn't like that, but for people in your families out there,
[01:54:12.734 --> 01:54:16.213]   just talk to them and explain that that weight and that bitterness and that darkness
[01:54:16.213 --> 01:54:21.773]   and that disconnect from God can come with repenting that you've killed your children.
[01:54:21.773 --> 01:54:24.173]  And I mean, I have murdered my children.
[01:54:24.173 --> 01:54:25.294]  I am a murderer.
[01:54:25.294 --> 01:54:26.694]  And that's just a fact.
[01:54:27.613 --> 01:54:33.413]   You know, I did an interview with the producer of a documentary called "The Matter of Life."
[01:54:33.639 --> 01:54:38.525]  It's about abortion, but it's the best documentary.
[01:54:38.606 --> 01:54:41.429]  If you haven't seen it, Alex, I'd encourage you to engage in it.
[01:54:41.469 --> 01:54:44.694]  It's called The Matter of Life, is the name of the documentary.
[01:54:45.054 --> 01:54:48.076]  And it's all done from a perspective of embryology.
[01:54:48.517 --> 01:54:54.542]  You know, that these two cells and these four cells are the same person as this 150-pound person sitting here.
[01:54:54.962 --> 01:54:55.963]  It's really, really good.
[01:54:56.003 --> 01:54:58.385]  I think it would make a good interview for you on your show.
[01:54:58.405 --> 01:54:59.085]  I'd love to have one.
[01:54:59.405 --> 01:54:59.966]  What's the name of it?
[01:55:00.486 --> 01:55:03.469]  It's called The Matter of Life, is the name of the documentary.
[01:55:03.489 --> 01:55:07.332]  And Michelle can get you the name and the contact information of the producer.
[01:55:07.352 --> 01:55:08.733]  Well, just an elaboration on that.
[01:55:09.573 --> 01:55:15.067]   When a human and you have sperm come together, there's that big flash of
[01:55:15.067 --> 01:55:15.587]  energy.
[01:55:15.587 --> 01:55:19.386]  And you don't see that with most of the creatures out there.
[01:55:19.386 --> 01:55:23.667]   You see it with whales and other more advanced things, but the point is there's this huge flash of energy, you don't
[01:55:23.667 --> 01:55:26.287]   even know what it is, this pulse when they come together.
[01:55:26.287 --> 01:55:29.786]  I mean, that's real magic. I mean, that is what God created.
[01:55:29.786 --> 01:55:31.786]  Exactly.
[01:55:31.671 --> 01:55:33.191]  So it's like, you know, that's life.
[01:55:33.571 --> 01:55:38.594]  But Michelle can get you or your people the information because it's a wonderful documentary.
[01:55:38.834 --> 01:55:39.434]  I listen to that.
[01:55:39.454 --> 01:55:43.396]  I don't usually spend time to watch two hour documentaries.
[01:55:43.436 --> 01:55:44.556]  I just don't really have the time.
[01:55:44.596 --> 01:55:47.357]  But in preparation for that interview, I watched the whole thing.
[01:55:47.678 --> 01:55:49.238]  And it's really, really, really good.
[01:55:49.438 --> 01:55:50.839]  So Michelle can get your people that.
[01:55:51.379 --> 01:55:54.401]  So just as we're closing up here, there's two last questions I want to ask you.
[01:55:54.561 --> 01:56:03.145]   One is say something about your book, about why you wrote it and what You know, there's a lot of books out there about the New World Order and the Reset now.
[01:56:03.686 --> 01:56:05.907]  What made you decide you wanted to write this book?
[01:56:07.729 --> 01:56:19.197]  Well, I'd read some other books on the Great Reset that were excellent, and I wanted to bring a bigger perspective to it and kind of the endgame of what they were planning and how they're stealing free will and the whole future.
[01:56:19.598 --> 01:56:21.539]  Now it's bigger than just a global corporate takeover.
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:24.842]  So the Great Reset is literally the plans of the Death Star.
[01:56:26.323 --> 01:56:32.505]  And the proof of their criminal conspiracy against humanity and their own admissions that they want to be God and that they want to play God.
[01:56:33.666 --> 01:56:38.267]  And so I just hope people will go to Infowarsstore.com and get a unsigned copy.
[01:56:39.208 --> 01:56:43.509]  Or as a fundraiser, we're selling a signed copy because we need the funds to stay on air.
[01:56:43.549 --> 01:56:46.711]  We will stay on air, despite all their attacks and all their fake judgments.
[01:56:47.271 --> 01:56:49.732]  This will all be overturned on appeal, but that'll take two years.
[01:56:50.032 --> 01:56:54.253]  So regardless, we'll be here for two more years if we have money for the appeals and those process.
[01:56:54.634 --> 01:57:01.287]   And we're just, you know, Right there in the edge of the black right now, so financial support for the viewers would be great.
[01:57:01.327 --> 01:57:06.049]  I hope people will get a copy of The Great Reset and The War for the World at infowarestore.com.
[01:57:06.069 --> 01:57:09.970]  That's one of the great books and films there on the site.
[01:57:10.090 --> 01:57:15.932]  And I know the listeners pretty much already know all this, but imagine your friends and family and neighbors getting a copy.
[01:57:15.952 --> 01:57:22.913]   Get it, read it, donate it to the library, and it'll be another seed you put out there another message in a bottle to the
[01:57:22.913 --> 01:57:23.673]  universe.
[01:57:23.673 --> 01:57:27.672]   And so, or try to take it to your library, your school library, that's got pedophilia in it,
[01:57:27.672 --> 01:57:31.752]   and watch the local AISD or local independent school district try to ban it.
[01:57:31.752 --> 01:57:37.112]   Well, then do a report on that and use their own censorship against them and have the book blow up
[01:57:37.112 --> 01:57:40.393]   even more. So I want to thank everybody that has gotten the book. I want to encourage everybody
[01:57:40.393 --> 01:57:45.112]   else to get it at mfullworthstore.com. What words of advice would you like to

[02:00:02.392 --> 02:00:05.578]  What words of advice would you like to leave our listeners with here today?
[02:00:05.918 --> 02:00:07.481]  Try to be as conscious as you can.
[02:00:07.561 --> 02:00:09.304]  Try to pray as much as you can.
[02:00:09.364 --> 02:00:21.767]   Try to really seek God's discernment and realize that You're not judged by how much money you have, you're not judged by what the world thinks of you, you're judged by what God sees.
[02:00:22.547 --> 02:00:31.609]  And that it's not fun to be persecuted in the flesh, but in the spirit it's actually the greatest high there is when you know they're coming after you because you're doing the right thing.
[02:00:31.649 --> 02:00:35.550]  So just keep your faith in God and get engaged now more than ever.
[02:00:35.590 --> 02:00:42.151]  Because the children are crying out to God to protect them, but God made us with free will, so God works through us to answer their prayers.
[02:00:42.631 --> 02:00:56.173]   And so we are, you know, on this earth, not like angels, but You know, we choose to serve God as God's instruments to go out imperfectly, but to go out and try to protect the innocent.
[02:00:56.733 --> 02:01:04.379]  And so, I do see it as, you know, once you're saved in Christ, the blood of Jesus, all is forgiven, but faith without works is dead.
[02:01:04.419 --> 02:01:12.305]  So yes, grace does it, but if you're really coming into Christ, then you're going to get stronger and stronger over time with Christ.
[02:01:12.625 --> 02:01:15.225]  and less and less will evil have control over you.
[02:01:15.225 --> 02:01:16.364]  None of us are perfect.
[02:01:16.364 --> 02:01:20.225]   But I mean, compared to how I was 10 years ago, when I was a Christian, a pretty good person then,
[02:01:20.225 --> 02:01:22.224]  I'm a way better person now.
[02:01:22.224 --> 02:01:23.444]  And so it's a process.
[02:01:23.444 --> 02:01:27.505]   And so God will reach out to you, but you've got to reach out to God.
[02:01:27.505 --> 02:01:30.503]  So God's knocking, but you got to open the door.
[02:01:30.503 --> 02:01:34.385]  And people have to realize that this is a process.
[02:01:34.416 --> 02:01:40.318]  And so if you don't step out and start doing this, the world's never going to get better.
[02:01:40.378 --> 02:01:47.981]  And so I would encourage people to start their own podcast or start their own letter to the editor or call in to talk radio more.
[02:01:48.001 --> 02:01:50.082]  Just don't change the world overnight.
[02:01:50.976 --> 02:01:51.937]  Many hands make light work.
[02:01:51.977 --> 02:02:03.273]  Just do a little something up front, like I did calling you to talk radio and going to city council meetings when I was, you know, 19 years old, 18 years old, and just looking for ways to be heard.
[02:02:03.293 --> 02:02:05.355]  I mean, look at city council, county commissioners.
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:09.782]  School boards everywhere, every day, flood Twitter, Instagram, everywhere.
[02:02:09.982 --> 02:02:12.263]  Oh, okay, they can ban this person, they can't ban everybody.
[02:02:12.523 --> 02:02:19.026]  And then you'll see videos with hundreds of thousands, millions of views, dozens of them, where you can't even watch them every day, but everybody else is.
[02:02:19.506 --> 02:02:27.710]  And it's just moms and dads and brothers and sisters and grandmas and grandpas and teachers going to the grassroots power structure and saying, we're not buying it.
[02:02:28.130 --> 02:02:30.872]  And that totally scared the system, where they said, send the FBI after them.
[02:02:31.072 --> 02:02:32.772]  Well, then, of course, the FBI was discredited for that.
[02:02:34.588 --> 02:02:36.709]  Every venue you can to be heard, be heard.
[02:02:36.769 --> 02:02:38.149]  Every venue you can magnify.
[02:02:38.169 --> 02:02:41.170]  Dr. Sherri, Tim Penney's information or my information, do it.
[02:02:41.370 --> 02:02:42.731]  That's great and it's true.
[02:02:43.171 --> 02:02:50.833]  I mean, you know, they hire, literally hire, troops of trolls to go out for their messages.
[02:02:51.454 --> 02:02:55.075]  And we have ten times more people, but you've got to volunteer your time.
[02:02:55.095 --> 02:03:01.657]  You know, I've said to people sometimes, you know, write down the five or six things that you're really interested in and pick one.
[02:03:02.197 --> 02:03:09.421]  Pick one and donate as much time and then decide how many hours per week of volunteer time that you can actually give.
[02:03:09.802 --> 02:03:10.942]  Is it five hours a week?
[02:03:11.002 --> 02:03:12.203]  Is it five hours a day?
[02:03:12.243 --> 02:03:15.605]  I mean whatever it is and then commit to it like it was a dental appointment.
[02:03:15.665 --> 02:03:22.068]   I mean you commit to it and really do because all of these all of our organizations need The boots on the ground.
[02:03:22.508 --> 02:03:23.909]  They all need people going out.
[02:03:23.949 --> 02:03:27.530]  And folks are going to find, folks are going to find it's not work.
[02:03:27.590 --> 02:03:28.630]  You'll get addicted to it.
[02:03:28.930 --> 02:03:32.411]  And there's so many organizations that are good, but they kind of plan all day.
[02:03:32.471 --> 02:03:34.211]  And you know, there's who's in charge of it.
[02:03:34.251 --> 02:03:35.772]  There's battles about the organization.
[02:03:36.112 --> 02:03:37.032]  Don't do that, folks.
[02:03:37.392 --> 02:03:38.332]  Just get out there.
[02:03:39.072 --> 02:03:40.973]  Just get out there and start speaking out.
[02:03:41.773 --> 02:03:44.934]  You know, put comments on things, you know, support things.
[02:03:44.954 --> 02:03:49.136]  You know, if you're going to buy something, buy it from Alex's store, buy it from our store.
[02:03:49.156 --> 02:03:54.619]  I mean, if you're going to buy it anyways, buy it from people that you want to support and don't support the beast by buying it from Amazon.
[02:03:54.959 --> 02:03:55.999]  Wars take money.
[02:03:56.179 --> 02:03:57.100]  Wars take money.
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:03:57.900]  Absolutely.
[02:03:57.920 --> 02:03:59.441]  And that's starting to happen.
[02:03:59.501 --> 02:04:00.321]  And that's what scares them.
[02:04:00.661 --> 02:04:01.762]  That's what scares them so much.
[02:04:02.262 --> 02:04:03.903]  Well, thank you so much for having me on.
[02:04:03.963 --> 02:04:04.763]  You're hard to get on.
[02:04:04.783 --> 02:04:05.784]  I know you're a busy person.
[02:04:05.984 --> 02:04:06.604]  You're prolific.
[02:04:07.164 --> 02:04:10.906]  And Dr. Sherry Tempenny, congratulations on being one of their top enemies.
[02:04:11.086 --> 02:04:11.986]  You're doing a lot of great work.
[02:04:12.046 --> 02:04:13.187]  And Alex, thank you so much.
[02:04:13.227 --> 02:04:14.047]  You're massive.
[02:04:14.587 --> 02:04:15.748]  What you're doing is so great.
[02:04:15.788 --> 02:04:19.029]  And if there's anything else I can do to support you, please don't be afraid to ask.
[02:04:19.069 --> 02:04:22.130]  And I want to thank you so much for your really candid disclosure here, Alex.
[02:04:22.630 --> 02:04:25.852]  I know people learn things about you today that they've never heard before.
[02:04:26.772 --> 02:04:27.854]  Probably we'll never hear again.
[02:04:27.934 --> 02:04:31.759]  So I want to thank our premium podcast members that these are the sort of things that we bring to you.
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:37.808]  And so we close all of our podcasts, whether they're pre-recorded or whether they're broadcast live, with Romans 12.12.
[02:04:38.890 --> 02:04:43.076]  Rejoice in hope, be patient with trouble, and be persistent in prayer.
[02:04:43.476 --> 02:04:47.498]  So until we meet again on our next broadcast, stay strong, stay in prayer, lean into God.
[02:04:47.538 --> 02:04:48.439]  He'll never let you down.
[02:04:48.899 --> 02:04:49.960]  Alex, we'll pray for you.
[02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:50.680]  We bless you.
[02:04:50.700 --> 02:04:52.641]  We thank you so much for everything you're doing.
[02:04:53.201 --> 02:04:56.563]  And thank you for never letting us down, my friend.
[02:04:56.703 --> 02:04:58.885]  Take care and have a great rest of your week.

[02:05:56.710 --> 02:06:08.710]  Free gifts in every order.
[02:06:08.710 --> 02:06:10.270]  [SIREN]
[02:06:10.293 --> 02:06:13.497]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread.
[02:06:13.597 --> 02:06:17.501]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[02:06:17.541 --> 02:06:19.543]  For beholden to scum!
[02:06:19.583 --> 02:06:21.065]  Russian scum!
[02:06:21.225 --> 02:06:23.167]  Listen.
[02:06:23.428 --> 02:06:28.854]  Please listen.
[02:06:29.955 --> 02:06:38.173]   If you don't, if you won't, If you fail to understand, then the same incredible terror that's menacing me will strike at you!
[02:06:38.233 --> 02:06:41.034]  The function of all life is survival.
[02:06:42.374 --> 02:06:43.735]  Sleep.
[02:06:47.476 --> 02:06:47.996]  Oh my God!
[02:06:48.977 --> 02:06:49.397]  Lock the door!
[02:06:50.017 --> 02:06:50.477]  Lock the door!
[02:06:50.497 --> 02:06:50.897]  They're coming!
[02:06:51.398 --> 02:06:52.358]  They're coming!
[02:06:52.538 --> 02:06:52.898]  Help!
[02:06:53.258 --> 02:06:53.578]  Help!
[02:06:53.979 --> 02:06:54.679]  They're coming!
[02:06:54.919 --> 02:06:55.579]  They're coming!
[02:06:55.659 --> 02:06:56.319]  Listen to me!
[02:06:56.599 --> 02:06:56.960]  Listen!
[02:06:56.980 --> 02:06:57.280]  Help me!
[02:06:58.983 --> 02:06:59.323]  Alex, please!
[02:06:59.623 --> 02:07:00.003]  Please!
[02:07:00.244 --> 02:07:01.624]  Your necks are in danger!
[02:07:01.804 --> 02:07:02.624]  Please, listen to me!
[02:07:02.704 --> 02:07:03.785]  It's something terrible!
[02:07:03.885 --> 02:07:04.325]  Please!
[02:07:04.745 --> 02:07:06.706]  Your necks are in the air!
[02:07:06.746 --> 02:07:09.167]  They're already here!
[02:07:09.267 --> 02:07:09.427]  Help!
[02:07:09.447 --> 02:07:09.807]  Your necks!
[02:07:09.867 --> 02:07:10.447]  They're coming!
[02:07:10.467 --> 02:07:11.347]  They're coming!
[02:07:11.567 --> 02:07:12.288]  Sleep.
[02:07:12.388 --> 02:07:13.468]  The seed is planted.
[02:07:13.508 --> 02:07:14.308]  Sleep.
[02:07:15.469 --> 02:07:16.329]  Sleep.
[02:07:16.429 --> 02:07:17.569]  Terror grows.
[02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.789]  Sleep.
[02:07:17.909 --> 02:07:19.270]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[02:07:19.770 --> 02:07:21.151]  We'll get you when you sleep!
[02:07:21.471 --> 02:07:22.911]  Sit up!
[02:07:23.011 --> 02:07:25.112]  Invasion of the body snatchers.
[02:07:26.639 --> 02:07:28.779]  All of a sudden, they're growing like parasites.
[02:07:28.859 --> 02:07:29.720]  Is it contagious?
[02:07:30.160 --> 02:07:32.540]  It looked right at me.
[02:07:32.580 --> 02:07:33.600]  You need to get out!
[02:07:33.640 --> 02:07:35.381]  You're looking at it as if it was human.
[02:07:35.461 --> 02:07:36.341]  It was not human.
[02:07:38.581 --> 02:07:41.742]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[02:07:41.782 --> 02:07:43.502]  We're being cornered!
[02:07:43.582 --> 02:07:47.663]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[02:07:47.703 --> 02:07:50.004]  They're barricading the street.
[02:07:49.984 --> 02:07:51.984]  invasion of the body searchers.
[02:07:51.984 --> 02:07:53.984]  Land of the walking dead!
[02:07:53.984 --> 02:08:17.984]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:18.979 --> 02:08:20.643]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:24.247 --> 02:08:26.349]  All right, the planets have aligned.
[02:08:26.429 --> 02:08:28.591]  Sean Stone was just happy to be visiting in town.
[02:08:28.611 --> 02:08:29.872]  We talked and said, why don't you come on the show?
[02:08:30.413 --> 02:08:32.835]  And Vivian Kubrick is here making a documentary film.
[02:08:32.855 --> 02:08:35.037]  Both you guys are filmmakers in your own right.
[02:08:35.097 --> 02:08:38.961]  And of course, you're an author, Sean Stone, as well on a TV producer.
[02:08:39.021 --> 02:08:43.185]  And both your fathers are some of the most famous directors in history, Stanley Kubrick.
[02:08:43.205 --> 02:08:45.587]  And of course, your dad needs no introduction.
[02:08:46.508 --> 02:09:01.798]  Oliver Stone, and your dad's an expert on, and so are you, on what's happening over in Ukraine that's leading us towards World War III, the whole false flag missile attack, the World Government cashless society being announced, stolen elections, just mass psychosis, they're planning for new lockdowns.
[02:09:02.239 --> 02:09:04.520]  I mean, we really are stepping into the dystopia.
[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:07.742]  I hate being vindicated, being on air 28 years, reading their own documents.
[02:09:08.203 --> 02:09:11.205]  I wasn't predicting, I knew they had power, they were planning this, I tried to stop it.
[02:09:11.665 --> 02:09:13.986]  Now we're in it, but people are halfway awake.
[02:09:14.026 --> 02:09:23.356]   This is, how would you describe, first, It's like being in a dream.
[02:09:24.256 --> 02:09:29.256]   It's like being in a dream where everyone is in a sense experiencing their own realities.
[02:09:29.256 --> 02:09:35.095]   And it's almost difficult to get us on the same wavelength, the same page here.
[02:09:35.095 --> 02:09:38.976]   Because as you said, there are these forces that we can identify and we can point to and
[02:09:38.976 --> 02:09:43.455]   obviously it's manipulating the media, the news cycle that's put out there.
[02:09:43.455 --> 02:09:47.376]   We can really tell the agenda very clearly based on the news cycle.
[02:09:47.376 --> 02:09:51.736]   But as far as our experience of it, it is so different, right?
[02:09:51.693 --> 02:09:55.735]  I mean, life has broken down into that place where maybe that's the point.
[02:09:55.795 --> 02:10:07.879]  The beauty of it is if we can reclaim some sense of how reality in Los Angeles is 180 degrees different from what it is right now here in Austin, from what I experience and live in Florida, right?
[02:10:08.199 --> 02:10:10.540]  And maybe that's the beauty of it, is getting back to the States.
[02:10:10.580 --> 02:10:15.461]  And I think that, if anything else, my only hope right now is looking at the elections going, okay, great.
[02:10:15.662 --> 02:10:16.562]  They did their rigging.
[02:10:16.602 --> 02:10:19.663]  They've drawn out these ballots for days and weeks.
[02:10:20.203 --> 02:10:22.625]  It's disgusting, obviously, what can be done now with the rigging.
[02:10:23.045 --> 02:10:26.207]  But look at least at Florida, it's totally red.
[02:10:26.648 --> 02:10:31.151]  And Texas, obviously, they didn't get Beto in here.
[02:10:31.551 --> 02:10:34.333]  It wasn't like there were some major tectonic shifts that took place.
[02:10:34.373 --> 02:10:46.322]   So if you go to the state levels, There is still a fight going on, and there is still resistance going on at the state levels, and there is still opportunity, I think, for people to say, well, I can't deal with California politics anymore, I'm leaving.
[02:10:46.502 --> 02:10:56.910]  You know, we've seen that obviously, and I think it'll just continue, and it'll continue in the coming years, because the more that they force down our throats these policies, the more the human spirit just rejects it and says, no, that's not my reality anymore, I'm leaving.
[02:10:57.190 --> 02:10:57.890]  I totally agree with you.
[02:10:57.911 --> 02:11:02.373]  I told my wife two days ago, I said, I even cut a little promo this canary next week where I give Thanksgiving.
[02:11:02.814 --> 02:11:05.895]  I'm more thankful now than ever because good versus evil is so clear.
[02:11:06.236 --> 02:11:07.376]  Before it was out of the surface.
[02:11:07.817 --> 02:11:13.380]  Now it's been forced out in the open and the forces of enslavement who are anti-free will are more desperate than ever.
[02:11:13.420 --> 02:11:17.483]  So this looks really bad, but it's forcing the infection.
[02:11:18.143 --> 02:11:18.863]  To the surface.
[02:11:19.283 --> 02:11:25.565]  And as you said, the paradox of being in one state like it's another country versus one that's still under the mind control is night and day.
[02:11:25.585 --> 02:11:27.685]  And it just, it shows there's a way out.
[02:11:28.126 --> 02:11:33.487]  And as people in those more enslaved areas see those of us in less enslaved areas, we become an example to them.
[02:11:33.527 --> 02:11:37.348]  Vivian Kubrick, how would you describe the place we're at right now worldwide and also here in America?
[02:11:37.984 --> 02:11:47.093]  Well, I feel like people are being challenged, unlike any other period of history, to actually interface with their true selves.
[02:11:47.393 --> 02:11:54.841]  To not operate from being, you know, inculcated with, you know, lies and the psyops.
[02:11:54.901 --> 02:11:57.843]  In fact, Sean and I were just talking about this before we went live on air.
[02:11:58.504 --> 02:12:01.287]  That people need to understand how the PSYOPs work.
[02:12:01.707 --> 02:12:04.950]  That's going to really help them emerge as their true selves.
[02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:07.572]  Because PSYOPs are weird.
[02:12:08.313 --> 02:12:09.734]  You know, they really do affect you.
[02:12:09.754 --> 02:12:10.515]  They affect me.
[02:12:11.616 --> 02:12:15.079]  And it's so... God, what's the right word?
[02:12:17.081 --> 02:12:17.901]  It... I can't think of it.
[02:12:18.162 --> 02:12:20.604]  It begins with I. That's the only thing I can remember.
[02:12:20.684 --> 02:12:22.445]  Anyway... It's very surreal.
[02:12:23.446 --> 02:12:40.710]  Well, it's very surreal when you actually start to see, like I was saying the other night, the mainstream media cut together all the talking heads and then this super sinister alignment of everything they're saying is the same sentence.
[02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:42.731]  That is so terrifying to me.
[02:12:43.291 --> 02:12:51.253]  And if only people could just see 30 seconds of those kinds of videos, they're going to go, wait a minute, nobody's actually independently reporting the news.
[02:12:51.273 --> 02:12:51.713]  That's right.
[02:12:53.153 --> 02:13:01.338]  Well, I had this conversation recently about you, Alex.
[02:13:01.358 --> 02:13:01.778]  It was funny.
[02:13:01.798 --> 02:13:02.418]  I was in L.A.
[02:13:02.438 --> 02:13:04.479]  and I was talking to a filmmaker there.
[02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:15.305]  And he was basically giving me the talking points as to why you were being sued because you had incited people to digging up graves and terrorizing the Sandy Hook parents.
[02:13:16.658 --> 02:13:23.421]  Well, I'm not sure if that's true, but if that is true, if he's guilty of incitement, think about the consequence of that.
[02:13:24.162 --> 02:13:25.922]  And it's like, only then did I actually catch him.
[02:13:26.183 --> 02:13:27.363]  He started thinking about it.
[02:13:27.723 --> 02:13:28.324]  Think about that.
[02:13:28.424 --> 02:13:35.447]  So you say something that incites me, and I go over there and I rob someone or I kill someone, and now you're responsible?
[02:13:35.767 --> 02:13:37.148]  Actually, I just want to say something.
[02:13:37.168 --> 02:13:38.248]  That takes everybody else's freedom.
[02:13:38.268 --> 02:13:39.229]  But that's the whole point.
[02:13:39.289 --> 02:13:41.610]  We've lost responsibility if we're guilty of incitement.
[02:13:41.650 --> 02:13:43.071]  My father got sued for this in the 90s.
[02:13:44.462 --> 02:13:45.903]  Natural born killers, right?
[02:13:46.344 --> 02:13:47.084]  Well, wait a minute.
[02:13:47.124 --> 02:13:57.570]  I just want to say, with Cloquette Orange, people at the time, people were raping and killing and robbing and then they were saying, oh, I did it because I saw Cloquette Orange, which I doubt was ever true.
[02:13:58.011 --> 02:14:00.592]  But anyway, Margaret Whitehouse, I think that's her name.
[02:14:00.812 --> 02:14:01.453]  I can't remember now.
[02:14:01.753 --> 02:14:07.897]  Anyway, she was a big kind of like, you know, moral compass for the conservative world.
[02:14:08.237 --> 02:14:14.381]  You know, said that my father was responsible for these things and it became so bad that my father actually said, right, that's it.
[02:14:14.401 --> 02:14:18.643]  I don't want Clockwork Orange to be shown in England again as long as I live.
[02:14:18.823 --> 02:14:24.647]  Because he was being... I mean, literally, I couldn't... And of course, the film makes you not want to be violent and is anti-violence.
[02:14:24.827 --> 02:14:27.089]  Oh, well, this... You know what?
[02:14:27.749 --> 02:14:31.992]  This is what we were talking about last week, about the audience contributes to the film.
[02:14:32.332 --> 02:14:40.918]  So if the audience is at a very low level consciousness, what they're going to contribute and understand about the film, it's going to be very different than how you and I did experience it.
[02:14:41.398 --> 02:14:42.999]  I just must tell you a hilarious thing.
[02:14:43.479 --> 02:14:52.746]  A guy, big tech guy in California, in Los Angeles, Hollywood, he said to me that he loved Clockwork Orange because he thought Alex was living such a great life.
[02:14:53.286 --> 02:14:53.926]  And I sort of went...
[02:14:56.148 --> 02:15:02.511]  Well, that was exactly the point of Clockwork Orange, which inspired Natural Born Killers in some way.
[02:15:02.331 --> 02:15:07.810]   film it's obvious the state's corrupt and evil and it's reflecting down to the grassroots.
[02:15:07.810 --> 02:15:08.810]  And that's what it's saying.
[02:15:08.810 --> 02:15:12.211]   Well that was exactly the point of Clockwork Orange which inspired Natural Born Killers
[02:15:12.211 --> 02:15:13.211]  in some way.
[02:15:13.211 --> 02:15:14.211]  Did it?
[02:15:14.211 --> 02:15:17.331]   Well it was involved, I mean I know that my father when I was in the film Natural Born
[02:15:17.331 --> 02:15:20.331]  Killers as the little brother of Mallory Knox right.
[02:15:20.341 --> 02:15:21.462]  The Julia Lewis character.
[02:15:21.842 --> 02:15:25.705]  He had me wear the Clockwork Orange makeup in homage to that film.
[02:15:26.425 --> 02:15:28.847]  And of course it was about the violence of society, right?
[02:15:28.867 --> 02:15:36.452]  That's what Natural Born Killers was trying to reflect, was how violent my father conceived of the media portrayal of violence.
[02:15:36.512 --> 02:15:37.993]  It's a fascination with violence.
[02:15:38.073 --> 02:15:40.315]  Just like they promote mass shootings, they know it causes more.
[02:15:40.575 --> 02:15:42.296]  Well, it's like they promote the mass shootings.
[02:15:42.476 --> 02:15:43.357]  Look at Netflix right now.
[02:15:43.377 --> 02:15:48.319]  I mean, most of Netflix's shows are about crime, serial killers, Dahmer, it's, you know, cannibalism.
[02:15:48.379 --> 02:15:51.701]  It's like, it's a very brutal, dark perspective of reality, right?
[02:15:51.761 --> 02:15:53.842]  That's what's feeding, that's what we're basically being fed.
[02:15:54.182 --> 02:15:55.083]  This is powerful.
[02:15:55.163 --> 02:15:56.724]  Sean Stone, Vivian Kubrick, stay with us.
[02:15:56.744 --> 02:15:57.904]  Let's come right back to this topic.
[02:15:58.224 --> 02:15:59.145]  When we come back, stay with us.
[02:16:00.486 --> 02:16:04.249]  Let me tell you about all the latest specials right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:16:04.289 --> 02:16:05.651]  Let me go down the list here.
[02:16:05.731 --> 02:16:10.615]  Now again, folks, you came through yesterday and shopped at InfoWarsStore.com, so I'm going to be able to take the truck out.
[02:16:10.675 --> 02:16:12.396]  Thanks to everybody for tuning in, for sharing it.
[02:16:12.416 --> 02:16:15.079]  We're going to be going over two hours as well as a huge success.
[02:16:15.579 --> 02:16:20.664]  Big up to the crew behind me, big up to the riders in the studio putting up the story at InfoWars.com.
[02:16:20.724 --> 02:16:24.027]  Remember, folks, if you like this, go shop at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:16:24.087 --> 02:16:25.208]  They're trying to shut us down.

[02:18:00.526 --> 02:18:07.110]  In the modern world, where they convince a woman to get a job, the man to get a job, they inflate the currency so nobody can exist any other way because it's too expensive.
[02:18:07.391 --> 02:18:08.812]  The parents are out working all day.
[02:18:08.972 --> 02:18:11.713]  The school and the internet and the matrix raise your children.
[02:18:11.733 --> 02:18:15.056]  Your children go to school all day and be told things that you may not want them to learn.
[02:18:15.176 --> 02:18:18.538]  Then they sit on the internet and read things and watch things you may not want them to watch.
[02:18:18.578 --> 02:18:21.060]  You talk to them for 10 minutes, at the end of the day, they go to bed.
[02:18:21.100 --> 02:18:28.104]  You're fighting with your 10 minutes against endless hours of the most entertaining programming or the most forceful programming.
[02:18:28.144 --> 02:18:29.105]  In school, it's forceful.
[02:18:29.345 --> 02:18:30.366]  On the internet, it's entertaining.
[02:18:30.626 --> 02:18:33.149]  Convincing them of ideas that you perhaps don't agree with.
[02:18:33.470 --> 02:18:34.631]  I've seen it myself on YouTube.
[02:18:34.691 --> 02:18:39.157]  I've seen a guy in America driving his car and his kids were in the back seat and he was arguing with them about an issue.
[02:18:39.577 --> 02:18:40.879]  And he was like, where did you hear that?
[02:18:41.119 --> 02:18:41.439]  School?
[02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:43.101]  He's like, why did the school tell you that?
[02:18:43.142 --> 02:18:43.622]  That's not true.
[02:18:43.642 --> 02:18:46.666]  And his own children are arguing with him because they learned it in school.
[02:18:46.806 --> 02:18:48.168]  Have you ever tried to take your children out of school?
[02:18:48.368 --> 02:18:48.948]  You'll get fined.
[02:18:48.968 --> 02:18:49.569]  You'll get in trouble.
[02:18:49.609 --> 02:18:50.810]  No, your kids have to go to school.
[02:18:50.991 --> 02:18:52.572]  You have to give your kids away to the school.
[02:18:52.833 --> 02:18:55.816]  If you don't give your kids away to the brainwashing, you'll get in trouble.
[02:18:56.196 --> 02:19:03.504]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker, and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has truly earned the title of Top G.
[02:19:04.205 --> 02:19:07.826]  But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged the globalists.
[02:19:08.226 --> 02:19:13.367]  He is consecutively the most googled man in the world in the last two years.

[02:20:02.839 --> 02:20:06.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:07.239 --> 02:20:09.039]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:09.039 --> 02:20:21.440]   Johnstone Vivian Kubrick in studio here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:21.504 --> 02:20:23.445]  So you got caught off by the break, Sean and Vivian.
[02:20:24.158 --> 02:20:26.079]  You're talking about your dad makes a film against violence.
[02:20:26.099 --> 02:20:27.200]  Your dad makes a film against violence.
[02:20:27.220 --> 02:20:31.143]  It's obviously somebody that is empathetic and smart.
[02:20:31.203 --> 02:20:32.124]  It's obviously horrible.
[02:20:32.604 --> 02:20:33.465]  Makes you hate violence.
[02:20:33.545 --> 02:20:38.688]  And it's obviously the state has created a process that creates these creatures and then hires them as their police later.
[02:20:38.708 --> 02:20:42.171]  You know, the novel is powerful as well, Clockwork Orange.
[02:20:42.191 --> 02:20:49.182]   And then they turn it around and say you're promoting violence when it was both your fathers in those films exposing that the system
[02:20:49.182 --> 02:20:52.862]   in studies is actually creating the violence loop.
[02:20:52.862 --> 02:20:56.332]   Right, right. I mean that's well at least that was the intention of natural born
[02:20:56.332 --> 02:21:00.072]   killers as well as Clock of Orange but with natural born killers you recall there was a
[02:21:00.072 --> 02:21:03.483]   lawsuit that was brought in the nineties against my father by Grisham
[02:21:03.483 --> 02:21:05.382]   and company because of uh...
[02:21:05.382 --> 02:21:09.422]   uh... a person that was that was seriously crippled she was uh... crippled
[02:21:09.422 --> 02:21:12.102]   by a shooter who basically said that
[02:21:12.102 --> 02:21:15.182]   this guy went up there and he said I saw natural born killers a hundred times on
[02:21:15.182 --> 02:21:19.542]   mushrooms or whatever and they wanted to role play basically and play
[02:21:19.542 --> 02:21:23.542]   Mickey you know Mickey and Mallory and they shot people up and
[02:21:23.542 --> 02:21:29.632]   so the idea was that the lawsuit was against Oliver Stone and Warner Brothers as making a faulty product
[02:21:29.632 --> 02:21:31.342]   right like they inspired
[02:21:31.342 --> 02:21:35.602]   these shootings and it's like but that's the problem it's you can't go down
[02:21:35.602 --> 02:21:52.803]   this path of saying They misrepresented what I said, took it out of context, made it a huge issue, claimed I made a big issue, judge found me guilty, and then now they call it the Alex Jones precedent where they can claim if anybody does anything we claim encourages somebody else to do something, then I'm at fault for someone digging up someone's grave that it turns out never even happened.
[02:21:53.083 --> 02:21:53.244]  Right.
[02:21:53.564 --> 02:21:58.087]  But you know, you're both talking about a key issue about us as humanity.
[02:21:58.588 --> 02:22:01.130]  Is that, are we going to be responsible for ourselves?
[02:22:01.450 --> 02:22:11.838]  Or are we always going to have big nanny and big nanny in our head going, well, I must take care of humanity and make sure that I never put anything out which might cause them to go and strangle somebody.
[02:22:12.578 --> 02:22:17.122]  Why wouldn't we expect for humanity to go, well, strangling people is bad.
[02:22:17.502 --> 02:22:21.145]  Even though it's in this film, I'm not going to do it because it's terrible.
[02:22:21.465 --> 02:22:27.352]  And it's just like you were saying, you know, earlier though, the system knows full well that that's not the case.
[02:22:27.372 --> 02:22:30.436]  They never criticize their product that's actually designed to do it.
[02:22:30.456 --> 02:22:31.978]  They criticize those that are trying to stop it.
[02:22:33.072 --> 02:22:42.237]  You know, again, it's gotten to a very dangerous place, as you say, Vivian, when you let go of individual responsibility, because that's what we've seen the last two years, right?
[02:22:42.277 --> 02:22:49.721]  I mean, the whole thing with the pandemic was like, no one, I remember seeing this quote recently, it's like, no one is safe until everyone is safe.
[02:22:49.821 --> 02:22:50.341]  Oh, God.
[02:22:50.481 --> 02:22:52.142]  And it's like, what does that even mean?
[02:22:53.082 --> 02:22:54.303]  You're never going to be safe.
[02:22:54.343 --> 02:22:54.723]  I'm sorry.
[02:22:54.763 --> 02:22:56.664]  And now we know it doesn't protect you and is a fraud.
[02:22:56.684 --> 02:22:59.466]  So what did that director say when you pointed out you're next?
[02:23:00.199 --> 02:23:00.499]  Who's that?
[02:23:01.140 --> 02:23:05.342]  You said you were talking to a filmmaker and you said once they get Alex Jones, now you can be blamed as well.
[02:23:05.722 --> 02:23:07.864]  Right, well that was actually an interesting moment.
[02:23:07.904 --> 02:23:13.927]  I think that we did then get to a more common ground because he was so agitated against you, personally, and that's the point.
[02:23:14.267 --> 02:23:15.228]  Sorry, which director?
[02:23:15.528 --> 02:23:16.789]  I'm not going to say who it was.
[02:23:16.809 --> 02:23:25.934]  The point is that, you know, when people are so personally, you know, we've gotten to this place, right, where it's about, you know, if Trump says it, it doesn't matter what it is.
[02:23:25.975 --> 02:23:27.155]  The sky's blue, he's wrong.
[02:23:27.195 --> 02:23:28.096]  You know, we don't like him.
[02:23:28.786 --> 02:23:35.769]  And we've turned this into an inability to hear what's being said because we so are ready to attack whoever says it, right?
[02:23:35.789 --> 02:23:37.850]  So if Alex says it, then it must be bad.
[02:23:38.191 --> 02:23:44.193]  But if I say it and all of a sudden it's like, huh, oh, maybe that actually makes sense, you know, because maybe I'm not as controversial.
[02:23:44.213 --> 02:23:51.817]  Or Democrat Congress members incite violence against Republicans and say it's good that Scalise got shot or good that Rand Paul got his ribs broken and lung pierced.
[02:23:52.097 --> 02:23:55.539]  That's good, but then they lie and say, I invoked violence when I didn't.
[02:23:56.223 --> 02:24:01.544]  But that's, again, I mean, even if they did say that was good, you know what, they have the right to say that.
[02:24:01.624 --> 02:24:02.145]  I agree they do.
[02:24:02.205 --> 02:24:03.105]  And we acknowledge that.
[02:24:03.165 --> 02:24:04.505]  We acknowledge that freedom of speech.
[02:24:04.545 --> 02:24:24.051]  And that's what just, it's so difficult for us to fathom, you know, Vivian, you've been alive a little longer than I have, but like just going through these decades of watching how society has tried to normalize the idea that free speech is not inherently free, that we should be censored.
[02:24:24.071 --> 02:24:31.038]   So Vivian and Sean, What is the process the social engineers are in trying to restrict the general public's speech?
[02:24:31.058 --> 02:24:32.280]  I see it as a sign of weakness.
[02:24:33.075 --> 02:24:37.398]  Oh, it's without question weakness, because they don't want to be challenged in any way.
[02:24:37.438 --> 02:24:45.044]  But I think that that's the nature of bullies and criminals, is that they only know how to crush in order to achieve their ends.
[02:24:45.484 --> 02:24:55.471]  And I think what we have to understand is there's nothing more important than having dialogue, exchanging ideas, defending our position, but also being willing to listen.
[02:24:55.511 --> 02:24:58.093]  But that would be the mark of maturity.
[02:24:58.233 --> 02:25:11.422]   And right now they've tried to, you know, Create infantile populations who, you know, look to the government to, you know, be saved or look to the government for the truth and won't do anything unless they're given a go-ahead.
[02:25:11.482 --> 02:25:12.703]  It's terrifying.
[02:25:12.723 --> 02:25:14.184]  I absolutely agree.
[02:25:14.825 --> 02:25:16.626]  Can the general population be saved?
[02:25:16.666 --> 02:25:21.569]  Because if they do get brainwashed into an animal form, now they're a howling mob that can be used against us.
[02:25:21.669 --> 02:25:22.370]  I don't want to kill them.
[02:25:22.390 --> 02:25:23.751]  I don't want to put everybody in prison.
[02:25:23.791 --> 02:25:30.479]   But it's really an alchemy that's happening where I've had globalists tell me, they say, look, the public's a bunch of animals, they're going to get everybody.
[02:25:30.940 --> 02:25:32.102]  You'll be on our side soon enough.
[02:25:32.643 --> 02:25:38.333]  They say they're hastening the process of societal collapse because they believe it's going to collapse anyway, so why not just get it over with?
[02:25:40.177 --> 02:25:46.923]  You know, I saw today's study validating a lot of the stuff you were talking about with the drop in male fertility and sperm, right?
[02:25:46.963 --> 02:25:50.787]  And it's like, I saw it was up, down a drop in 60% in the last 50 years.
[02:25:50.827 --> 02:25:54.050]  So we've gone past the 50% mark into the 60 plus percent mark.
[02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:58.514]  And obviously we know that the shots, the COVID shots are designed to, to affect.
[02:25:58.994 --> 02:26:01.756]  The ovaries and they're affecting, obviously, female periods.
[02:26:02.756 --> 02:26:06.058]  I think that 2021 was the first year I saw no one really caught that.
[02:26:06.078 --> 02:26:09.620]  They said in America there was really no increase in population for the first time.
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:10.561]  It was really interesting.
[02:26:10.581 --> 02:26:12.962]  I mean, I'm not, I don't know about the immigrant or the migrant.
[02:26:13.142 --> 02:26:16.364]  A precipitous drop directly connected to German study to the shot.
[02:26:17.064 --> 02:26:22.306]  But that's for sure, the point being that we are now going to go into this collapse, at least in the West.
[02:26:22.366 --> 02:26:26.407]  Now, a lot of the Eastern world didn't get the shots, right?
[02:26:26.427 --> 02:26:30.468]  A lot of Africa, a lot of Asian countries, a lot of poor countries didn't necessarily do this.
[02:26:30.528 --> 02:26:34.449]  Well, the globalists say it's the first world producing the most, so they hit us first.
[02:26:35.367 --> 02:26:36.007]  Right, right.
[02:26:36.047 --> 02:26:41.750]  And this is going to be really what's so interesting to see how this plays out in this coming time period, right?
[02:26:42.410 --> 02:26:44.891]  The overall, you know, fourth industrial revolution, right?
[02:26:44.911 --> 02:26:52.974]  They want a centralized, controlled population in cities that are sort of sterilized, that basically go like Brave New World.
[02:26:52.994 --> 02:26:58.217]  You want to, you know, have a child, you go into the doctor and you basically go choose your, you know, your ovary.
[02:26:58.277 --> 02:27:00.317]  I guess you choose the ovary, you choose, you know, the sperm.
[02:27:00.357 --> 02:27:03.839]  And they're admitting that's their plan and we're just trying to have a debate about the world they're building.
[02:27:04.139 --> 02:27:04.999]  Right, and then, yeah.
[02:27:05.019 --> 02:27:06.400]  Sorry, I must just say something.
[02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:25.524]  Let's just acknowledge the fact that these people are insane, they're psychopathic, they have no empathy, and what they're trying to create is so diabolical that to describe it as anything like they're planning this, they're planning... No, this is the act of kind of computing psychotics.
[02:27:25.584 --> 02:27:31.765]  They've got the ability to be brilliant, but they have no ability to be human, and... They're in love with the... I call it the science of tyranny.
[02:27:32.386 --> 02:27:34.127]  Well, actually, yeah.
[02:27:34.227 --> 02:27:47.570]  I think I mentioned this the last time, but anybody who wants to look at the most absolutely gobsmacking, incredible fact, Aristotle, 2400 years ago, in his book on ethics, wrote about, if you want to create a tyranny, this is what you do.
[02:27:47.630 --> 02:27:49.371]  It's about two or three pages long.
[02:27:49.391 --> 02:27:55.473]  I invite everyone to go and look at it, because you will realize how ancient this playbook is.
[02:27:55.493 --> 02:27:57.173]  Oh, and Plato is their model.
[02:27:57.233 --> 02:27:58.053]  No, Aristotle.
[02:27:58.413 --> 02:27:59.874]  Well, I suppose he was his student, but...
[02:28:00.994 --> 02:28:03.355]  Tell me the particular Aristotle derivatives so we can look that up.
[02:28:03.855 --> 02:28:05.135]  Oh, um... I remember.
[02:28:05.155 --> 02:28:06.315]  We'll try to find it during the break, but yes.
[02:28:06.835 --> 02:28:10.236]  Just look up Syracuse and Persia.
[02:28:10.316 --> 02:28:21.078]  If you do a word search, I think it'll get you straight to it, because he talks about these women who are spies, and I think they're called the Whores of Syracuse or something.
[02:28:21.699 --> 02:28:25.199]  I mean, but the thing is... Guys, look up Aristotle the Whores of Syracuse, yes.
[02:28:25.219 --> 02:28:26.680]  Or Syracuse, just as a word search.
[02:28:27.360 --> 02:28:27.560]  Yeah.
[02:28:28.240 --> 02:28:31.982]  Anyway, probably it would take about, you know, five minutes to read it.
[02:28:33.302 --> 02:28:39.145]  You will be absolutely shocked to see that if you want to run a tyranny, it's always been run the same way.
[02:28:39.165 --> 02:28:42.466]  2,400 years ago, they're doing exactly what they're doing now.
[02:28:42.627 --> 02:28:44.107]  Well, you've got right to the root.
[02:28:44.347 --> 02:28:46.568]  It was Plato that wrote up these plans.
[02:28:47.909 --> 02:28:48.249]  Yeah.
[02:28:49.029 --> 02:28:54.392]  Well, I mean, the Republic and how he imagined society being run in fashion.
[02:28:55.287 --> 02:28:56.229]  Actually, can I just say something?
[02:28:56.289 --> 02:28:56.529]  Go ahead.
[02:28:56.629 --> 02:28:57.471]  Oh yeah, I gotta break.
[02:28:57.491 --> 02:28:58.833]  The trees were still on the radio stations.
[02:28:58.873 --> 02:28:59.414]  I know they're annoying.
[02:28:59.233 --> 02:29:11.553]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:11.687 --> 02:29:22.577]  Here, put it in our Alex Jones was wrong jar.
[02:29:22.797 --> 02:29:26.460]  I've got just over a billion dollars at this location.
[02:29:27.220 --> 02:29:28.220]  It's yours.
[02:29:28.220 --> 02:29:42.220]  [Music]
[02:29:42.220 --> 02:29:47.220]  You're watching the American Journal with Harrison Smith.
[02:29:47.242 --> 02:29:48.943]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:49.263 --> 02:29:52.724]  This is The War Room with Owens Troyer.
[02:29:53.004 --> 02:29:56.766]  InfraWars, the most banned network in the world.
[02:30:00.498 --> 02:30:05.524]  Someone compared me to Socrates, which is a compliment, but he was vilified.
[02:30:05.544 --> 02:30:06.945]  He ended up poisoning himself in Athens.
[02:30:06.965 --> 02:30:11.731]  The charge against him, if you read about his poisoning and his arrest, they said he was corrupting the youth.
[02:30:11.811 --> 02:30:14.434]  But he wasn't corrupting them, he was inspiring them to challenge authority.
[02:30:14.494 --> 02:30:15.935]  He was inspiring them to think for themselves.
[02:30:16.576 --> 02:30:22.518]  When you have the youth, the masculine youth of the world, thinking for themselves, that's pretty scary to authority.
[02:30:23.178 --> 02:30:29.340]  Because it's the masculine youth of the world that is, one, the revolutionaries, and two, also, that's the backbone of the slave force.
[02:30:29.940 --> 02:30:33.021]  If you need people to go die in a ditch in Afghanistan, you need them.
[02:30:33.361 --> 02:30:38.963]  More than you need the feminists and the liberals, you need the real men to go out there to purport and prop up a system.
[02:30:39.103 --> 02:30:43.824]  And if enough of these men stand in one place and say, this is enough, that's when a revolution happens.
[02:30:44.184 --> 02:30:53.823]   So this is the most dangerous, There's a group of the demographic that the Matrix and the people are trying to control and they have to have a narrative over and that's why they're trying to weaken them in every regard.
[02:30:55.074 --> 02:31:06.703]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker, and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has truly earned the title of Top G. But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged the globalists.
[02:31:07.103 --> 02:31:12.287]  He is consecutively the most Googled man in the world in the last two years.
[02:31:12.527 --> 02:31:17.130]  And that's because his message is about human, and specifically, male empowerment.
[02:31:17.611 --> 02:31:23.295]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.
[02:31:23.855 --> 02:31:26.236]  Introducing Top G Supplements.
[02:31:26.816 --> 02:31:31.858]  We are proud to introduce and sponsor the Top G line of supplements by Andrew Tate and his crew.

[02:32:05.114 --> 02:32:06.274]  What do you mean I'm not fighting a battle?
[02:32:06.314 --> 02:32:08.436]  I'm fighting a battle against the oppression of humankind.
[02:32:08.816 --> 02:32:13.079]  AndrewTatePower.com The only way you fail is not taking action.
[02:32:13.439 --> 02:32:17.876]   AndrewTatePower.com They see me as a threat because of my mass influence.
[02:32:18.156 --> 02:32:23.099]  And me being positive in and of itself is also a threat to the establishment because they don't want people to be happy.
[02:32:23.139 --> 02:32:28.623]  They want you to be semi-depressed and sad and miserable because when you're sad, you're self-obsessed.
[02:32:28.924 --> 02:32:29.484]  And you're distracted.
[02:32:29.804 --> 02:32:31.285]  You're distracted and you're self-obsessed.
[02:32:31.325 --> 02:32:34.588]  When you're sad, you're sitting at home, me, me, me, me.
[02:32:34.668 --> 02:32:35.588]  It makes you very selfish.
[02:32:35.688 --> 02:32:37.410]  You don't care about your community when you're sad.
[02:32:37.790 --> 02:32:41.813]  So the fact that I have mass influence and I can just make people feel better is a threat to them.
[02:32:42.313 --> 02:32:44.054]  They don't want me to make people feel better.
[02:32:44.174 --> 02:32:50.476]  They talk about men's mental health and pretend to care, but when I come along and genuinely help and stop people from committing suicide, they delete me.
[02:32:50.516 --> 02:32:51.056]  They don't want that.
[02:32:51.096 --> 02:32:52.296]  They want everybody semi-depressed.
[02:32:52.837 --> 02:32:53.677]  They want you miserable.
[02:32:53.817 --> 02:32:59.699]  They want you distracted, so that you're too busy crying your eyes out in a room somewhere, so they can just continue to run the world.
[02:33:02.439 --> 02:33:08.278]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones
[02:33:08.278 --> 02:33:30.099]   Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones
[02:33:30.099 --> 02:33:35.099]  Alex Jones.
[02:33:35.299 --> 02:33:40.124]  People have asked me what I think of Elon Musk, and I've kind of told you, but it would take an hour to really break it down.
[02:33:40.184 --> 02:33:40.724]  It's important.
[02:33:41.986 --> 02:33:43.647]  He's the next level of the New World Order.
[02:33:44.367 --> 02:33:45.467]  He plays both sides.
[02:33:46.247 --> 02:33:48.928]  He says he's pro-humanity, but he also goes along with our whole agenda.
[02:33:49.548 --> 02:33:50.929]  I don't know if he's a good guy or a bad guy.
[02:33:50.969 --> 02:33:51.969]  A tree bites fruits.
[02:33:52.809 --> 02:33:53.749]  But I told everybody this.
[02:33:53.789 --> 02:33:55.210]  I'm not worried about getting back on Twitter.
[02:33:56.590 --> 02:33:58.971]  He's under such attack, even trying to make it quasi-free.
[02:33:59.411 --> 02:34:00.531]  They're destroying it right now.
[02:34:00.591 --> 02:34:05.113]  But he did respond to folks asking him today, what should Twitter do next?
[02:34:05.173 --> 02:34:07.133]  And a lot of folks said, bring back Alex Jones.
[02:34:07.613 --> 02:34:08.954]  His response was, no.
[02:34:10.387 --> 02:34:16.432]  So, that is kind of a litmus test, because that's a bridge too far, but that's part of that process.
[02:34:16.472 --> 02:34:19.234]  Now, Vivian Kubrick's here, so is Sean Stone.
[02:34:19.254 --> 02:34:28.321]  We've got a lot to talk about, a lot of big issues, but you were getting into philosophy and going back to the Greek philosopher Aristotle and his mentor.
[02:34:28.882 --> 02:34:40.358]   And of course, Plato put out two, three sides to everything, but he was the first to say that the plebes are crushing the breast of Mother Earth, we need to Banned poor people breeding, we need to have breeding programs, make better people.
[02:34:40.780 --> 02:34:43.869]  What he talked about later got picked up by the Romans, then it got picked up.
[02:34:44.696 --> 02:34:51.560]  By Malthus, then it got picked up by Francis Galton, then it got picked up by the eugenicists in England and then Adolf Hitler.
[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:56.323]  So, when we see the transhumanists, they all hail from that same school.
[02:34:56.703 --> 02:34:59.985]  The discoverer of DNA, you know, saying blacks are subhuman and all that.
[02:35:00.385 --> 02:35:07.329]  It's really the same group, but now, as you talked about Bertrand Russell, it's all wrapped in a liberal, neoliberal packaging.
[02:35:07.349 --> 02:35:08.230]  Vivian, please continue.
[02:35:08.612 --> 02:35:15.674]  Well, I was just saying to Sean, actually, in the break, you know, you can't reinvent the wheel, really, and to have a tyranny, you basically have to do the same thing.
[02:35:15.734 --> 02:35:33.380]  So, I just want to say, if you want to read about Plato, really, ironically, written by a eugenicist and whatever, Bertrand Russell, if you go to the History of Western Philosophy, Chapter 14, I think it is, you'll see described there, basically, the blueprint for the globalists.
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:45.028]   And I would say that, to put it in a nutshell, Whatever it is that determines somebody's state of consciousness, what's consistent here is that they have contempt for others.
[02:35:45.729 --> 02:35:50.811]  And it seems like what's really astonishing is they always have the same old playbook.
[02:35:51.531 --> 02:35:52.571]  Total, total conceit.
[02:35:52.591 --> 02:35:53.152]  You've got a quote.
[02:35:53.172 --> 02:35:53.692]  Tell us where it's from.
[02:35:53.712 --> 02:35:54.092]  Contempt.
[02:35:54.392 --> 02:35:54.632]  Right.
[02:35:54.652 --> 02:35:56.673]  So this is from Aristotle's Ethics.
[02:35:57.153 --> 02:36:00.535]  And this is how to have a tyranny, a successful one.
[02:36:01.535 --> 02:36:04.736]  As to tyrannies, they are preserved in two most opposite ways.
[02:36:04.877 --> 02:36:08.978]  One of them is the old traditional method in which most tyrants administer their government.
[02:36:09.478 --> 02:36:17.642]  Of such arts, Persian of, sorry, uh, yeah, Peridot, I can't read that, of Corinth is said to have been the great master.
[02:36:18.422 --> 02:36:22.764]  And many similar devices may be gathered from the Persians in the administration of their government.
[02:36:23.104 --> 02:36:31.028]   They are firstly, the prescriptions, the prescriptions mentioned some distance back, sorry this is all, Lead up.
[02:36:32.830 --> 02:36:33.771]  Some distance back.
[02:36:33.831 --> 02:36:41.981]  For the preservation of a tyranny, in so far as this is possible, that the tyrant should lop off those who are too high.
[02:36:42.802 --> 02:36:44.825]  He must put to death men of spirit.
[02:36:45.485 --> 02:36:49.651]  He must not allow common meals, clubs, education and the like.
[02:36:50.976 --> 02:36:59.041]  He must be upon his guard against anything which is likely to inspire either courage or confidence amongst his subjects.
[02:36:59.622 --> 02:37:03.925]  He must prohibit literary assemblies or other meetings for discussion.
[02:37:04.625 --> 02:37:11.310]  And he must take every means to prevent people from knowing one another, for acquaintance begets mutual confidence.
[02:37:12.050 --> 02:37:18.435]  Further, he must compel all persons staying in the city to appear in public and live at his gates.
[02:37:18.975 --> 02:37:20.376]  Then he will know what they are doing.
[02:37:21.197 --> 02:37:23.959]  If they are always kept under, they will learn to be humble.
[02:37:24.239 --> 02:37:30.384]  In short, he should practice these and the like Persian and barbaric arts, which all have the same object.
[02:37:31.124 --> 02:37:50.057]  A tyrant should also endeavor to know what each of his subjects says or does, and should employ spies like the female detectives, sorry, not whores, female detectives of Syracuse, and the eavesdroppers who Hero was in the habit of sending to any place of resort or meeting.
[02:37:50.577 --> 02:37:58.023]  For the fear of informers prevents people from speaking their minds, and if they do, they are more easily found out.
[02:37:58.743 --> 02:38:02.466]  Another art of the tyrant is to sow quarrels amongst the citizens.
[02:38:03.206 --> 02:38:07.669]  Friends should be embroiled with friends, the people with the notables, and the rich with one another.
[02:38:08.190 --> 02:38:10.291]  Also, he should impoverish his subjects.
[02:38:10.692 --> 02:38:14.474]  He thus provides against the maintenance of a guard by the citizen and the people.
[02:38:14.915 --> 02:38:19.238]  Having to keep hard at work are prevented from conspiring.
[02:38:19.938 --> 02:38:20.698]  I mean, it goes on.
[02:38:20.718 --> 02:38:22.539]  But that's 2400 years ago.
[02:38:22.719 --> 02:38:35.183]  It's so interesting, the concept of the cancel culture, I see it, is very much like the spy network in the old days, you know, and the idea of being found out for what you said.
[02:38:35.783 --> 02:38:40.985]  Being found out for thinking in a way that could be construed as dangerous or different, right?
[02:38:41.045 --> 02:38:46.146]  And so now it's self-imposed cancellation that occurs, right?
[02:38:46.506 --> 02:38:48.387]  You don't allow yourself to say what you think.
[02:38:48.427 --> 02:38:53.048]  You don't allow yourself to be heard saying something that can be attacked and targeted.
[02:38:53.588 --> 02:38:54.428]  You self-censor.
[02:38:54.588 --> 02:38:54.968]  That's right.
[02:38:55.509 --> 02:39:00.090]  And if you look at that model, all of it has now been compounded and we see it being done today.
[02:39:01.381 --> 02:39:04.064]  It's all before our eyes now, right?
[02:39:04.084 --> 02:39:06.146]  And that's what's the crazy part, right?
[02:39:06.226 --> 02:39:09.749]  Things that are in front of our faces, we can't talk about, right?
[02:39:09.769 --> 02:39:15.535]  I mean, even to the place now that finally the Congress is hopefully going to do something with this Hunter Biden story, right?
[02:39:15.555 --> 02:39:17.336]  And the corruption of old Joe.
[02:39:18.698 --> 02:39:26.245]   But the point being that Even to this day, people are being accused of conspiracy theory for talking about it.
[02:39:26.445 --> 02:39:28.227]  Yeah, what's with this?
[02:39:28.528 --> 02:39:29.509]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[02:39:29.549 --> 02:39:35.676]  Can we just finally say out loud that the CIA came up with this terminology in order to...
[02:39:36.957 --> 02:39:37.718]  They weaponized it.
[02:39:37.778 --> 02:39:41.961]  They said you have to slander the conspiracy theorists.
[02:39:41.981 --> 02:39:52.808]  Your dad made JFK, which is an excellent film, but it came out a few years after that the CIA said, people questioning, we just call it conspiracy theory, so that we can ridicule those without looking at the actual evidence.
[02:39:53.228 --> 02:39:56.971]  Yeah, it was very clear how they targeted anyone that questioned the Warren Commission.
[02:39:57.411 --> 02:40:02.932]   But the point is that the government uses conspiracies all the time, so I try to say to people, Look at RICO Acts.
[02:40:03.032 --> 02:40:10.901]  The government uses conspiracy when it goes after drug dealers, when it goes after, you know, even, you name it, Trump, you know, they go after these things on conspiracy, right?
[02:40:10.941 --> 02:40:12.062]  The January 6th stuff.
[02:40:12.082 --> 02:40:15.707]  I mean, it's like, it's all government usage of conspiracy that no one questions.
[02:40:15.927 --> 02:40:20.392]  Why is it that if I say conspiracy, you know, everyone's... Big Tobacco, that was a conspiracy.
[02:40:20.412 --> 02:40:21.894]  The government went after them on conspiracy.
[02:40:22.014 --> 02:40:23.855]  Here's the control, though, when you pull back.
[02:40:23.915 --> 02:40:28.176]  I have articles right here where Biden got questioned about the new congressional investigation to his son.
[02:40:28.556 --> 02:40:30.657]  He said that's a conspiracy theory that's been debunked.
[02:40:31.057 --> 02:40:35.738]  And they censored everybody two plus years ago during the campaign that tried to raise it, even though they now admit it's real.
[02:40:35.778 --> 02:40:40.020]  But in the audio and in the video, they're taking orders from the head of Chinese intelligence.
[02:40:40.340 --> 02:40:44.061]  So they make it about Burisma and gas companies and 10 percent for the big guy.
[02:40:44.381 --> 02:40:49.502]  That's a diversion from him saying me and my dad take orders from Xi Jinping, which is true.
[02:40:49.963 --> 02:40:51.243]  That's really the big enchilada.
[02:40:51.543 --> 02:40:52.604]  Yeah, that's a big quote.
[02:40:55.987 --> 02:41:02.211]  Well, I'll tell you, my honest opinion is that there isn't a political system, there is just gangsterism.
[02:41:02.471 --> 02:41:03.372]  That's how this planet works.
[02:41:03.392 --> 02:41:04.573]  No, I agree, it's a group of gangsters.
[02:41:04.993 --> 02:41:18.964]  Yeah, so I mean, anything that you've learned about the mafia, just apply it to government and all of this so-called diplomatic... I'm sure... Well, that's another big psy-op, that Italians invented organized crime, and they're the only ones that do this.
[02:41:20.533 --> 02:41:23.934]  I mean, the globalist mafia, it's the real mafia.
[02:41:25.515 --> 02:41:34.377]  In the ancient, thousands of years, thousands of years of mafia, rulership of empires, and then all of a sudden it becomes, you know, democracy, so-called.
[02:41:34.557 --> 02:41:37.058]  You could write a book on the secret mafia, the real mafia.
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:40.522]  Well, I don't know enough of those old families.
[02:41:40.542 --> 02:41:42.985]  I think, Vivian, you don't need those old families?
[02:41:43.005 --> 02:41:47.830]  This is what I know, is that it takes a certain kind of human being and they exist all over the place.
[02:41:47.850 --> 02:41:49.912]  I was about to say, they'll use any group or any organization.
[02:41:49.972 --> 02:41:51.954]  It's a cult of philosophy.
[02:41:52.635 --> 02:41:54.477]  It's a cult of criminal beings.
[02:41:54.737 --> 02:41:56.179]  It's like Soros working with the Nazis.
[02:41:56.199 --> 02:41:57.280]  I mean, it doesn't matter.
[02:41:57.340 --> 02:41:58.321]  It's just what they do.
[02:41:58.641 --> 02:42:01.603]  By the way, if anybody hasn't seen this, you need to find this.
[02:42:01.923 --> 02:42:13.931]  George Soros gave this interview, probably about, I don't know, 25 years or 30 years ago, where he just matter-of-factly, which is so classic of psychopaths, admits that he helped the Nazis, and he suggests I would do it again.
[02:42:15.089 --> 02:42:16.290]  If I didn't do it, who else?
[02:42:16.530 --> 02:42:17.291]  Someone else would.
[02:42:17.351 --> 02:42:19.933]  Yeah, and it was the happiest time of my life.
[02:42:19.953 --> 02:42:23.236]  It shaped his psychology, which is what's so important to understand about Soros.
[02:42:23.276 --> 02:42:28.321]  But now you can't, you know, Wikipedia, you know, is all Soros agents, so that's why so much is scrubbed on Wikipedia.
[02:42:28.361 --> 02:42:29.242]  Well, Soros is a good person.
[02:42:29.462 --> 02:42:29.662]  Right?
[02:42:29.903 --> 02:42:30.103]  What?
[02:42:30.323 --> 02:42:30.723]  Exactly.
[02:42:31.144 --> 02:42:31.464]  Joking.
[02:42:32.925 --> 02:42:34.225]  This is the ridiculous of the time, though.
[02:42:34.265 --> 02:42:36.066]  You say something against Soros, you're anti-Semitic.
[02:42:36.086 --> 02:42:40.208]  I mean, it's like, that has nothing to do with it, too.
[02:42:40.288 --> 02:42:43.709]  It's like saying someone is being a gangster, and you're saying, well, you're anti-Italian.
[02:42:43.749 --> 02:42:46.730]  It's like, just because that person's a gangster doesn't mean they're racist.
[02:42:46.750 --> 02:42:52.313]  This is a great trick that they're playing on people, and you've got to, like, stop getting into this, people.
[02:42:52.733 --> 02:42:59.076]  You need to recognize that there are Jews, Muslims, Christians, atheists, Buddhists, who are evil people.
[02:43:00.216 --> 02:43:06.681]  For only the second time in the entirety of the InfoWars store, we are announcing a selling out mega blowout sale.

[02:46:45.399 --> 02:47:02.840]  Force Plus, and so much more all about the sellout at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:07.161]  a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:06.956 --> 02:47:08.716]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:08.716 --> 02:47:30.116]  We got some Clockwork Orange music bringing us in here.
[02:47:30.139 --> 02:47:32.681]  Vivian Kubrick, you got caught off by that break, I'm sorry.
[02:47:33.081 --> 02:47:34.162]  We'll try to take it out of context.
[02:47:34.182 --> 02:47:36.864]  Go back to what you were saying and complete the statement.
[02:47:37.384 --> 02:47:45.590]  Alright, so I'm sick of Jewish criminals, Christian criminals, Buddhist criminals, atheist criminals, whatever you are, you're a criminal.
[02:47:46.070 --> 02:47:56.417]   But in this whole thing, the Jewish issue of, you know, claiming people are anti-Semitic if they attack a Jewish criminal, There are plenty of Jews.
[02:47:56.457 --> 02:47:59.298]  There are like 15.2 million Jews on this planet.
[02:47:59.738 --> 02:48:02.240]  I don't think they want to be associated with George Soros.
[02:48:02.280 --> 02:48:04.481]  George Soros is a criminal and a psychopath.
[02:48:04.801 --> 02:48:11.585]  You only have to listen to his interview where he claims that it was the happiest time of his life when he was handing Jews over to the Nazis.
[02:48:12.025 --> 02:48:13.626]  So he is a nut job.
[02:48:14.326 --> 02:48:29.636]  I have no hesitation in describing him as a criminal, an arch-criminal, and he cannot hide behind anti-Semitism when he claims that it's, or people claim that it's anti-Semitic to say that he's a horrific criminal.
[02:48:30.456 --> 02:48:36.981]  And just as you, you know, there are Christian criminals, if you say that... Yeah, none of them should be able to hide behind a religion or an ethnicity.
[02:48:37.081 --> 02:48:47.268]  No, you... But these people are good at making it about that as a diversion, and there are plenty of groups that are out of control that hate people because of what group they've been part of, and that's terrible too.
[02:48:47.488 --> 02:48:50.971]  Well, actually the only group that I think the left won't criticize now is Satanists.
[02:48:51.311 --> 02:48:53.893]  I think that's the most protected class, I think.
[02:48:54.133 --> 02:48:55.374]  The most protected group, I think.
[02:48:55.913 --> 02:48:56.514]  That's a good point.
[02:48:57.034 --> 02:48:58.836]  That is a terrifyingly good point.
[02:48:58.856 --> 02:48:59.296]  No, it's true.
[02:48:59.316 --> 02:49:01.258]  Why do you think that is?
[02:49:04.141 --> 02:49:04.982]  Why do you think it is?
[02:49:05.042 --> 02:49:08.345]  I mean, my docuseries, Best Kept Secret, got into all this, right?
[02:49:08.365 --> 02:49:12.489]  The whole dark cabal and how this is an inversion agenda.
[02:49:12.509 --> 02:49:17.633]   I mean, if you really think about what's happened in our reality, And, you know, left is right and up is down and black is white.
[02:49:17.653 --> 02:49:21.096]  I mean, that's all...Anton LaVey was talking about that back in the 70s.
[02:49:21.117 --> 02:49:22.918]  That was his quote, you know, freedom is slavery.
[02:49:22.938 --> 02:49:25.140]  I mean, there was a complete inversion of reality.
[02:49:25.540 --> 02:49:36.490]  And to get to this place now where we are, in a place where kids can't drink but they can have a sex change, and for the, you know, permanently, you know, castrating themselves, that's normalized.
[02:49:36.530 --> 02:49:41.134]  I mean, you can have abortion up until birth, if not after birth, in California.
[02:49:41.154 --> 02:49:41.555]  Which is horrendous!
[02:49:41.835 --> 02:49:46.276]  I mean things like this that just was like, it was so far, like so far from us.
[02:49:46.296 --> 02:49:47.917]  This really is a satanic revolution.
[02:49:47.977 --> 02:49:48.177]  Right?
[02:49:48.237 --> 02:49:49.578]  It's a really fascinating thing to watch.
[02:49:49.598 --> 02:49:51.538]  That'd be a great book or film, the satanic revolution.
[02:49:51.978 --> 02:49:53.219]  Oh don't, you'll encourage them.
[02:49:54.399 --> 02:49:55.840]  Well no, we'd expose it, that'd be our film.
[02:49:56.560 --> 02:50:02.762]  Well I do think that this is the... Sean Stone, Vivian Cooper and Alex Jones in the new top film, the satanic revolution.
[02:50:04.093 --> 02:50:05.976]  Oh, they'll probably go, oh, this will be worth watching.
[02:50:06.276 --> 02:50:08.038]  They'll think it's about them in a really nice way.
[02:50:08.058 --> 02:50:14.948]  But explain how they're being set up to be alone and cut off being selfish and how you think the devil's hot cheerleaders or whatever.
[02:50:15.588 --> 02:50:16.229]  But it's not.
[02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:17.411]  It's impoverishment.
[02:50:17.731 --> 02:50:18.352]  It's betrayal.
[02:50:18.412 --> 02:50:18.753]  It's death.
[02:50:19.053 --> 02:50:24.396]  But Alex, this is the most key thing about understanding, let's say, the devil or Satan.
[02:50:24.416 --> 02:50:27.978]  Let's say it's not even a question of this actually being a real being that lives.
[02:50:28.018 --> 02:50:29.259]  Let's just say... The archetype.
[02:50:29.559 --> 02:50:29.739]  Right.
[02:50:30.179 --> 02:50:32.601]  That what you're dealing with is half-truths.
[02:50:33.061 --> 02:50:48.090]  The only way you can persuade people is if you actually have half of the truth, and in that way you can enslave them, because that's how you... I mean, con artists, the government, the CIA, they always try and hang on to... When you're catching a bass, there's a real live worm on the hook.
[02:50:48.749 --> 02:50:51.111]  There has to be something there that's real.
[02:50:51.571 --> 02:50:53.373]  Otherwise you're not going to capture people.
[02:50:53.673 --> 02:50:56.956]  And then what you do is you just keep putting them off.
[02:50:56.976 --> 02:50:59.538]  You just keep navigating them away from the truth.
[02:50:59.999 --> 02:51:05.263]  And then it's only when it's too late and they're caught in a trap, or they're so deluded that they don't... I agree.
[02:51:05.303 --> 02:51:08.246]  What I've noticed is that people who buy lottery tickets are degenerate gamblers.
[02:51:09.229 --> 02:51:12.312]  They're being abused by it, but they keep doubling down because they've invested so much.
[02:51:12.372 --> 02:51:12.612]  Right.
[02:51:13.092 --> 02:51:15.475]  Well, that's a real crazy part of humanity.
[02:51:15.495 --> 02:51:29.747]  I mean, the human condition is that the attempt to be right is so powerful that the defensiveness that comes over people when you even remotely go at the things that they're hanging on to is the truth.
[02:51:30.408 --> 02:51:31.849]  I'm sorry, banging my mic here.
[02:51:32.890 --> 02:51:35.131]  Yeah, is that they get very defensive.
[02:51:35.171 --> 02:51:46.794]  That's why it's a real art to enter into a conversation with, for instance, people who have been fully PSYOPT and gently, you know, get them back into a place where they can differentiate.
[02:51:47.454 --> 02:51:54.856]  And the thing is, I've had this conversation with someone who is very progressive and said, oh, it's not true what you're saying, that they were going to kill babies at birth.
[02:51:54.876 --> 02:51:57.417]  And I said, look, here is this woman, I forget her name.
[02:51:57.477 --> 02:51:58.017]  Here's the legislation.
[02:51:58.317 --> 02:51:59.438]  Well, here's the legislation.
[02:51:59.478 --> 02:52:00.038]  I sent him that.
[02:52:00.158 --> 02:52:07.704]  I said, here's the woman speaking to the court, and the judge says to her, so you're saying that you would actually end the life of a baby after it's born?
[02:52:07.964 --> 02:52:09.105]  And she kept if-ing and off-ing.
[02:52:09.425 --> 02:52:10.706]  And then he said, well, yeah.
[02:52:11.246 --> 02:52:12.247]  Yeah, that would be what it is.
[02:52:12.487 --> 02:52:16.530]  And the guy said to me, oh, she's just not good at expressing herself.
[02:52:16.670 --> 02:52:17.510]  And I went, what?! !
[02:52:18.371 --> 02:52:23.834]  She absolutely clearly said, yes, we would consider... That's right, they have like a form of Stockholm Syndrome.
[02:52:24.454 --> 02:52:26.355]  Is it even worth it to try to save those people?
[02:52:26.395 --> 02:52:29.016]  Instead, get the people that are awake just to stop complying?
[02:52:30.517 --> 02:52:30.977]  We have to.
[02:52:30.997 --> 02:52:32.358]  I mean, we have to do something here.
[02:52:33.764 --> 02:52:34.625]  That's clear, right?
[02:52:35.245 --> 02:52:40.187]  And again, I don't know that you can do it with this system the way that it's rigged currently, right?
[02:52:40.207 --> 02:52:49.231]  I mean, that was the most disheartening thing of the last few weeks, was just watching 2020 happen all over again, with these drawn-out mail-in ballot schemes, right?
[02:52:49.251 --> 02:52:53.052]  That's taking days, and then obviously, you know, just seeing it, it's inevitable, right?
[02:52:52.871 --> 02:52:56.992]   As you said, you're optimistic because there's a lot of awakening worldwide, but it's paradoxical
[02:52:56.992 --> 02:52:57.992]  because it's also getting worse.
[02:52:57.992 --> 02:53:00.871]  So, for every action there's an opposite or equal reaction.
[02:53:00.871 --> 02:53:03.751]   Newtonian physics, John Stone, how do you see this playing out?
[02:53:03.751 --> 02:53:06.072]  Just gut level, just a staunt of the future.
[02:53:06.072 --> 02:53:07.072]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:53:07.072 --> 02:53:10.070]   No, I mean, there has to be a bifurcation coming here, right?
[02:53:10.099 --> 02:53:13.320]  I mean, this letting off of those that want to be in the cities.
[02:53:13.380 --> 02:53:18.442]  I mean, I'm very concerned about things like the graphene oxide in the food also, not just in shots.
[02:53:18.962 --> 02:53:20.463]  They're bombing everything with nanoparticles.
[02:53:20.663 --> 02:53:24.185]  I mean, it's exactly, it's in the foods, it's in the food supply, the processed foods.
[02:53:24.225 --> 02:53:30.229]  I mean, it's just a question of, look, we've watched them for decades putting this toxicities and spraying it into the air.
[02:53:30.770 --> 02:53:34.912]  People can't even see anymore what chemtrails are, they just look at the air and just go, oh yeah, it's just clouds.
[02:53:36.674 --> 02:53:38.956]  No one remembers what the heck clouds are supposed to look like.
[02:53:38.976 --> 02:53:40.758]  They just assume that chemtrails are normal.
[02:53:41.539 --> 02:53:42.841]  It's a dwindling spiral.
[02:53:42.881 --> 02:53:44.602]  The more they get poisoned, the more they get separated.
[02:53:44.943 --> 02:53:46.264]  So they're normalizing it.
[02:53:46.364 --> 02:53:47.105]  They're normalizing it.
[02:53:47.345 --> 02:53:47.646]  Exactly.
[02:53:47.666 --> 02:53:51.710]  The poisoning that's taken place of decades, you know, to the place of obviously the opioid epidemic.
[02:53:51.750 --> 02:53:54.373]  I mean, it's just depressing.
[02:53:54.433 --> 02:53:55.715]  And why do they want to kill us?
[02:53:56.275 --> 02:54:00.358]  I guess it goes back to 2001, uh, Arthur C. Clarke and your dad's great film.
[02:54:00.819 --> 02:54:06.663]  They, they just feel like they have to act as God and they have to call us off, but they're the worst of us.
[02:54:06.784 --> 02:54:09.626]  It's, it's like... Yeah, but that's what I was saying before.
[02:54:10.106 --> 02:54:11.307]  These people are insane.
[02:54:11.607 --> 02:54:12.628]  They're psychopathic.
[02:54:12.768 --> 02:54:20.014]   I think spiritually they are bankrupt and... And they're projecting their will To kill themselves onto us.
[02:54:20.194 --> 02:54:21.975]  How do we get them to look in the mirror and just kill themselves?
[02:54:22.376 --> 02:54:23.696]  But I don't want Klaus Schwab to kill himself.
[02:54:23.757 --> 02:54:24.477]  I wish he'd wake up.
[02:54:24.837 --> 02:54:25.858]  It's obvious he's too far gone.
[02:54:26.118 --> 02:54:29.200]  How do we get Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab to say, it's projection.
[02:54:29.720 --> 02:54:31.061]  You need to kill yourself.
[02:54:31.442 --> 02:54:37.386]  Well, actually, I'd be quite satisfied if they just became ineffectual because everybody knew how evil they are.
[02:54:37.766 --> 02:54:41.668]  My terror is that I still see people going, Bill Gates is so wonderful.
[02:54:41.708 --> 02:54:42.589]  He cares about us.
[02:54:42.629 --> 02:54:52.157]   Look at the fact, you know, ignoring the fact that 500,000 children in India were maimed and paralyzed by his On record.
[02:54:52.578 --> 02:54:59.446]  So do you think with their whole rollout, their lockdowns, their poison shot, they got what they want?
[02:54:59.466 --> 02:55:02.449]  Because I see it being rejected way worse than they thought it would.
[02:55:02.469 --> 02:55:03.691]  I think it's been a defeat for them.
[02:55:03.991 --> 02:55:07.235]  It's terrible for all the sick and dead people, but I don't see it going well for them, Sean.
[02:55:07.535 --> 02:55:08.636]  It's not going well for them.
[02:55:08.716 --> 02:55:15.838]  At the same time, it's like what they do is they make their big push and then they roll it back, you know, to about 30% of what it was.
[02:55:16.339 --> 02:55:18.359]  And then it's just like, it's a gradualism, right?
[02:55:18.380 --> 02:55:19.820]  That's the whole point of progressivism.
[02:55:19.860 --> 02:55:22.501]  It's progressive takeover of humanity.
[02:55:22.541 --> 02:55:26.583]  And so this has been a hundred year plan as we know now that the place of digital currency.
[02:55:27.143 --> 02:55:29.284]  The digitalization of everything.
[02:55:29.344 --> 02:55:31.385]  So the transhuman thing is inevitable.
[02:55:31.985 --> 02:55:33.846]  That's why even you mentioned about Elon Musk.
[02:55:33.906 --> 02:55:35.227]  It's like, well, he gets it.
[02:55:35.287 --> 02:55:36.847]  He's obviously doing the Neuralink.
[02:55:37.087 --> 02:55:38.188]  Do I think that he's evil?
[02:55:38.228 --> 02:55:39.208]  Is he trying to put in everyone?
[02:55:39.228 --> 02:55:39.508]  No.
[02:55:39.648 --> 02:55:43.230]  But I think he also, he's playing in a sense, he's playing with it.
[02:55:43.250 --> 02:55:44.431]  Plus the technology's not bad.
[02:55:44.471 --> 02:55:47.512]  If I'm in a car wreck and paralyzed, I hope he invents something to give me my legs back.
[02:55:47.972 --> 02:55:50.033]  We just don't want the software that controls us in it.
[02:55:50.533 --> 02:55:56.155]  Well, that's the point, exactly, is that, you know, it's like if you lost your legs, of course you want to be able to replace it.
[02:55:56.515 --> 02:56:07.698]  But do we want to then ultimately be the robots that they are envisioning of as far as a transhuman thing where, oh, I'm going to genetically splice my child and alter my child because that's going to make a perfect human?
[02:56:07.778 --> 02:56:09.099]  No, this doesn't work that way.
[02:56:09.119 --> 02:56:15.721]  Which takes us back to childhood and Arthur C. Clarke, a top illuminist, where, yeah, you're going to live forever, but you're going to give your body up and you're going to be controlled by us.
[02:56:16.161 --> 02:56:17.923]  Well, I don't even think that they'll achieve it.
[02:56:17.943 --> 02:56:24.531]  I think that the technology will never be perfected because you're playing with nature, which is much more perfect, right?
[02:56:24.871 --> 02:56:28.496]  Nature understands things that this human alteration can't.
[02:56:28.696 --> 02:56:33.121]  So the more that we play God, as we know, it creates monstrosities, right?
[02:56:33.481 --> 02:56:33.962]  It's inevitable.
[02:56:34.042 --> 02:56:41.165]  And then the big, you can't say a man can't be a woman in the future when they claim, oh, he's uploaded his consciousness, Bob's still alive.
[02:56:41.485 --> 02:56:45.027]  If you say that's not really Bob in the computer, you're hurting his identity, you get arrested.
[02:56:45.267 --> 02:56:46.967]  But really, Bob didn't live eternally.
[02:56:47.248 --> 02:56:49.909]  The corporation sold him that, but it's a fraud.
[02:56:50.489 --> 02:56:51.329]  I think it'll be a fraud.
[02:56:51.349 --> 02:56:55.731]  I don't think that you can take the human spirit and transmit and put it into a robot.
[02:56:55.831 --> 02:56:56.571]  I don't believe that.
[02:56:56.952 --> 02:57:02.194]  Well, I've met with top globalists and they admit that's their endgame, is that we're going to live in computers and that we're going to have to accept that.
[02:57:02.834 --> 02:57:05.756]  Yeah, to me it won't work because the spirit is connected to the body.
[02:57:05.916 --> 02:57:06.156]  Absolutely.
[02:57:06.176 --> 02:57:08.137]  Physical, natural, physical experience.
[02:57:08.237 --> 02:57:10.679]  It's an electrochemical machine that it's in.
[02:57:10.899 --> 02:57:11.379]  Right, exactly.
[02:57:11.419 --> 02:57:13.901]  And all we are is really an antenna to the dimensions.
[02:57:14.421 --> 02:57:15.221]  This is just an antenna.
[02:57:15.482 --> 02:57:15.702]  Right.
[02:57:15.722 --> 02:57:18.463]  So they can't make the antenna, the antenna's just dialing in.
[02:57:18.623 --> 02:57:28.148]   Yeah, no, even with the silicon machine or graphene oxide or whatnot, it's not going to be Connected to spirit using exactly this biochemistry.
[02:57:28.248 --> 02:57:33.729]  Or all the ancient DNA that goes back as a continued electrical pulse, which is I call the time machine.
[02:57:34.129 --> 02:57:36.350]  We think of ourselves just being alive now, but all our answers go back.
[02:57:36.690 --> 02:57:39.571]  That's the genetic code time machining through space.
[02:57:39.731 --> 02:57:39.971]  Yes.
[02:57:40.111 --> 02:57:40.951]  And it's an instant.
[02:57:41.011 --> 02:57:41.951]  It's one communication.
[02:57:42.111 --> 02:57:42.331]  Right.
[02:57:42.531 --> 02:57:45.532]  We'll be back with our number four straight ahead.
[02:57:45.592 --> 02:57:47.392]  Two more segments and Jade Iron takes over.
[02:57:47.412 --> 02:57:47.813]  Stay with us.

[02:58:48.368 --> 02:59:01.532]   InfoWarsStore.com Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors.
[02:59:02.073 --> 02:59:06.015]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[02:59:06.535 --> 02:59:10.477]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[02:59:10.497 --> 02:59:14.460]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[02:59:14.940 --> 02:59:21.001]   You see, the sun via your skin, helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[02:59:21.001 --> 02:59:24.880]   But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3,
[02:59:24.880 --> 02:59:28.200]   and then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating
[02:59:28.200 --> 02:59:29.559]  and taking your body over.
[02:59:29.559 --> 02:59:34.399]   So now it's more important than ever, because the winner's here, to take high quality vitamin D3,

[02:59:49.720 --> 02:59:58.880]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:59:58.880 --> 03:00:06.159]  (dramatic music)
[03:00:06.159 --> 03:00:08.921]  (dramatic music)
[03:00:08.921 --> 03:00:33.239]   But think about the power of that, that you are all your ancestors
[03:00:33.239 --> 03:00:39.140]   going back to the unknown eons, And you are the leading edge of all their consciousness and
[03:00:39.140 --> 03:00:39.799]  their will.
[03:00:39.774 --> 03:00:51.263]  And obviously their energy lives on in other dimensions, but we're not just conduits here personally now, we are part of a great genetic and psychic and spiritual and energetic trust.
[03:00:52.674 --> 03:00:58.078]  Can I offer a little bit of a clue that maybe they can get into a machine?
[03:00:58.098 --> 03:00:59.159]  Alright, now wait.
[03:00:59.719 --> 03:01:14.850]  So, if any of you have watched paranormal shows, you'll see that there's all this extraordinary evidence of disembodied in another dimension, communicating either as apparitions in front of people, or when they're recorded, it's called electronic voice phenomena.
[03:01:15.510 --> 03:01:17.152]  So, maybe they know a lot.
[03:01:17.212 --> 03:01:22.978]  We all know the CIA did, like, remote viewing, as did the KGB, or whatever it was, training people to do remote viewing.
[03:01:23.219 --> 03:01:24.941]  So they obviously believe in spirit.
[03:01:25.836 --> 03:01:36.139]  So, is it more to do with them defying God and wanting to be, you know, more powerful, and they're going to demonstrate to God that they can, like, outperform Him?
[03:01:37.279 --> 03:01:48.682]  Or are they actually taking something that's real, but because they're psychopaths and insane, they're doing something horrendous with it, which is like, you know... I mean... No, I agree they're trying to be God.
[03:01:49.122 --> 03:01:53.683]  Yeah, and they're inviting people to commit suicide, saying, hey, it'll be really great, you know, you've got a really screwed up body.
[03:01:53.983 --> 03:02:00.305]  Well, you can upload your mind into this thing, and I just feel they're using that as a way for people to knock them, you know, kill themselves.
[03:02:00.325 --> 03:02:01.886]  To make their free will to go into that dimension.
[03:02:01.906 --> 03:02:07.907]  They're not even really in the machine, but that's more like an archetype and a symbol of them in a ritual agreeing to go with that energy.
[03:02:08.307 --> 03:02:12.088]  Well, and to kill themselves, because this seems to be like the death cult of all death cults.
[03:02:12.448 --> 03:02:15.269]  They want to kill little babies, they want people to commit suicide.
[03:02:15.289 --> 03:02:18.110]  What they don't want you to do is pass on your genetic information, absolutely.
[03:02:19.025 --> 03:02:19.085]  Why?
[03:02:20.086 --> 03:02:20.146]  Why?
[03:02:20.727 --> 03:02:23.992]  Because they know it's going to end up creating something beautiful they can't stop.
[03:02:24.392 --> 03:02:27.417]  Oh, yes, that is a good, good answer.
[03:02:27.793 --> 03:02:33.498]  I mean, control is very much the endgame, right, of what these sociopaths or psychopaths are after.
[03:02:33.518 --> 03:02:37.521]  They want to control this dimension completely.
[03:02:37.561 --> 03:02:44.087]  That's why I think we were talking about the poisoning of the environment, you know, using the chemtrails, the chemicals, the heavy metals that are being sprayed, right?
[03:02:44.267 --> 03:02:45.888]  It's an assault on the third dimension.
[03:02:46.108 --> 03:02:53.554]  Well, it's an assault on the third dimension to be able to basically, the more you can metallicize it, the more you can then broadcast whatever frequencies you want, like, and they live, right?
[03:02:54.515 --> 03:02:55.416]  Metallicized, yeah.
[03:02:55.496 --> 03:02:57.478]  Yeah, that's what the nanotech is replicating in everybody.
[03:02:57.818 --> 03:02:58.538]  Right, right.
[03:02:58.558 --> 03:02:59.799]  They're putting the plugs into us.
[03:03:00.140 --> 03:03:01.401]  So Sean Stone, how do we beat them?
[03:03:02.901 --> 03:03:13.609]  Get back to nature, connect to, you know, detox your system, keep, you know, cleaning out your mind and your body and your spirit and just basically honor the Creator, you know, because that's it.
[03:03:14.089 --> 03:03:18.052]  This creation is of the Creator and we are all expressions of it, living expressions of it.
[03:03:18.092 --> 03:03:26.578]  So to honor ourselves and the spirit that emanates through us, that we are divine beings, to honor that is then to honor others and to respect others.
[03:03:26.878 --> 03:03:30.601]  These beings, you know, talking about sociopaths, they don't love themselves.
[03:03:31.041 --> 03:03:32.802]  So they don't love anyone else, you see.
[03:03:32.842 --> 03:03:35.283]  They don't have respect for themselves, so they don't respect anyone else.
[03:03:35.683 --> 03:03:41.566]  And that's why a lot of these things, a lot of these sexual perversions and stuff, as you know from these elites, it's like they're all into like S&M kind of things.
[03:03:41.586 --> 03:03:47.429]  They want to be beaten or, you know, they want children because they themselves are so, they hate themselves so much.
[03:03:47.469 --> 03:03:48.749]  They're so wretched inside.
[03:03:49.390 --> 03:03:51.090]  And it's a demonic energy, ultimately.
[03:03:51.131 --> 03:03:52.691]  It's such a low vibrational energy.
[03:03:53.111 --> 03:03:58.015]   So the more that we that are aware, awakening, can basically come into a place
[03:03:58.015 --> 03:04:02.915]   of more self-love, more self-awareness, more self-respect, then we respect others the same way, right?
[03:04:02.915 --> 03:04:06.216]   Well, that's true. The revolution is us changing ourselves individually. That will change the world.
[03:04:06.216 --> 03:04:07.216]  Absolutely.
[03:04:07.216 --> 03:04:13.845]   And that's where you have to take responsibility for yourself, learn how to differentiate and examine and expect
[03:04:13.845 --> 03:04:19.515]   information that you're being told, and bother to see if there's grotesque contradictions.
[03:04:19.763 --> 03:04:24.785]  I mean, because that's part of their hypocrisy, is they accuse you of the very thing they're doing.
[03:04:24.845 --> 03:04:26.186]  I actually think that's a technique.
[03:04:26.666 --> 03:04:31.629]  But they actually, they try to force you to have an opinion that they give you.
[03:04:32.169 --> 03:04:35.991]  And if you're not on your guard, you may actually take on that opinion.
[03:04:36.471 --> 03:04:39.473]  It actually takes work to be a responsible being.
[03:04:39.973 --> 03:04:45.395]  You actually have to really go, wow, I'm not going to immediately jump when they say jump.
[03:04:45.656 --> 03:04:49.317]  I'm going to look at this, which is what I did when this whole COVID thing began.
[03:04:49.357 --> 03:04:51.479]  And by the way, I want to really acknowledge this.
[03:04:52.019 --> 03:04:58.362]  Alex, you and your guests, I would guess, saved millions of people by giving them the right information.
[03:04:58.382 --> 03:05:00.203]  Let's talk about that because the next attack is coming.
[03:05:01.903 --> 03:05:08.366]  For only the second time in the entirety of the info or store, we are announcing a selling out mega blowout sale.

[03:05:40.344 --> 03:05:51.133]  After the seemingly never-ending barrage of attacks on us, Alex and the rest of the crew here at InfoWars needs all the help we can get to allow the message of a pro-human future to reach the masses.
[03:05:51.633 --> 03:06:00.857]  Hurry to the store of InfoWars now to check out the Mega Blowout Sale because some of these items are already selling out at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:05.620 --> 03:06:10.122]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[03:06:10.441 --> 03:06:12.441]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:12.441 --> 03:06:26.441]  [music]
[03:06:26.441 --> 03:06:30.441]   Alex Jones here back live final segment with our guest Sean Stone, Vivian Kubrick,
[03:06:30.441 --> 03:06:32.441]   and then the great Jay Dyer, who's been a researcher for the New World Order.
[03:06:32.876 --> 03:06:35.358]  He takes over in about 10 minutes, 15 minutes or so.
[03:06:36.298 --> 03:06:41.601]  But yes, the audience, the crew, our guest, this whole operation deserves the credit.
[03:06:41.641 --> 03:06:42.402]  She was getting into that.
[03:06:43.180 --> 03:06:49.966]  Of being the very tip of the spear exposing the virus out of the lab, the lockdowns being a fraud, the poison shot, which is why it's so important we stay on air.
[03:06:50.306 --> 03:07:04.618]  This whole community, it's not about credit, it's about recognizing we've been right and that they're trying to do new lockdowns, new injections, world IDs, global passports to travel, even leave your house.
[03:07:05.058 --> 03:07:06.279]  And so, Vivian, finish up your point.
[03:07:06.687 --> 03:07:18.851]  Well, I think it's incredibly important because this is what we're pushing back against are the lies about Infowars and the lies about Alex, is that Alex, his guests, his crew, everyone here have a mission.
[03:07:19.251 --> 03:07:28.234]  A mission to set humanity free and to get the people that are criminally crushing humanity, killing them at this point, culling them.
[03:07:29.955 --> 03:07:42.099]  You're not going to get the information that you need in order to protect yourself and to understand what's being done to you, probably from anywhere else that has such a vast audience as InfoWars.
[03:07:42.459 --> 03:07:50.581]  So I believe that I know that when COVID happened, I just moved back from Florida to Texas and I was just wobbling around.
[03:07:50.601 --> 03:07:51.361]  I wasn't paying attention.
[03:07:51.381 --> 03:07:53.442]  I walked into the supermarket and everything had gone.
[03:07:53.502 --> 03:07:54.522]  And I said, what's happened?
[03:07:54.802 --> 03:07:56.843]  They said, haven't you heard about COVID?
[03:07:57.043 --> 03:07:57.923]  And I went, no.
[03:07:58.404 --> 03:07:59.484]  And I turned on Alex.
[03:08:00.224 --> 03:08:11.175]  And then immediately you were talking to Francis Boyle, Dr. Francis Boyle, Professor Dr. whatever, Francis Boyle, and from the moment that you started reporting about it and having guests, you completely educated me.
[03:08:11.195 --> 03:08:30.290]   It let me go and find the documents myself, it let me think about what was going on, and then when I went to the supermarket and people were standing obediently six feet apart and having hysterics if anyone like pulled their mask down, It gave me the freedom to observe what was happening instead of getting pulled into the hysteria.
[03:08:30.870 --> 03:08:35.511]  And the one thing they want people to be is hysterical and frightened and waiting for the next disruption.
[03:08:35.531 --> 03:08:35.911]  Well, that's right.
[03:08:35.931 --> 03:08:47.374]  Well, the enemy is, this is our real brain trust with our guests and the whole family, is that we did dead on 100% nail what they were doing from previous research, which shows we can beat them again when they try it again.
[03:08:47.394 --> 03:08:48.055]  But that wasn't us.
[03:08:48.095 --> 03:08:51.275]  That was just studying the globalists who think we're so dumb.
[03:08:51.295 --> 03:08:55.458]   They admit, why do the globalists admit Sean's telling us so much we're going to do before they do it.
[03:08:56.570 --> 03:08:57.551]  Predictive programming.
[03:08:57.811 --> 03:08:59.672]  Because I think that, well, there's two aspects.
[03:08:59.892 --> 03:09:03.514]  You touch upon this a lot, where everything has to be disclosed at some level, right?
[03:09:03.554 --> 03:09:07.636]  There has to be a certain level of transparency, even if people don't believe it, right?
[03:09:07.696 --> 03:09:12.539]  Because if, you know, sometimes you say, hey, I'm going to punch you, and then you actually do it, people still don't believe it.
[03:09:12.559 --> 03:09:14.440]  They say, oh, no, wait a minute, that must have been something else.
[03:09:15.361 --> 03:09:20.924]  But, you know, there is this sort of spiritual law around revealing things.
[03:09:21.044 --> 03:09:29.110]   And then there is the predictive programming, which you could say is also designed to get people to To respond the way you want them to respond, right?
[03:09:29.150 --> 03:09:33.952]  So you put out movies like that Soderbergh film that was ridiculously bad about the pandemic, right?
[03:09:34.073 --> 03:09:34.953]  It was done a few years ago.
[03:09:34.973 --> 03:09:35.753]  What was the name of it?
[03:09:35.773 --> 03:09:36.114]  Do you remember?
[03:09:36.654 --> 03:09:43.037]  Soderbergh made it with, uh, anyway, with Jude Law and all his people in this, and how the CDC is racing to save everyone from this deadly new virus.
[03:09:43.077 --> 03:09:45.418]  Oh yeah, they even had a movie right before it came out that showed it, yeah.
[03:09:45.478 --> 03:10:09.072]   Well it came out a few years ago and then the point was that like when the lockdown started all these people going oh it's trending on Netflix everyone's gonna watch this movie again you know because it's it's this it's basically telling you how they want you to respond how you they want you to perceive the CDC as the savior they want you to perceive the government as the good guys right and that's a lot of the films in general that we've seen across time right so consistently this idea of You know, the good guys in, you know, in the U.N.
[03:10:09.112 --> 03:10:15.056]  or whatever, you know, in the good CIA, and then like there's a one rogue bad CIA guy, but the CIA generally is good, right?
[03:10:15.076 --> 03:10:29.027]  I mean, this is the same narrative that gets pushed across over and over to just get people to really be docile in a sense, to not think for themselves, to not realize that the government is not your friend, and has, you know, again, has become this beam.
[03:10:29.047 --> 03:10:30.768]  You know what's interesting about the federal government?
[03:10:31.509 --> 03:10:32.149]  It's about 40% of our GDP.
[03:10:33.905 --> 03:10:36.766]  Do you realize what that means to our reality?
[03:10:37.406 --> 03:10:41.287]  The federal government is 40% of our GDP as a nation.
[03:10:41.327 --> 03:10:41.947]  Think about that.
[03:10:42.367 --> 03:10:46.068]  And all this spending, all the military, industrial complex, so-called, but it's everything.
[03:10:46.128 --> 03:10:46.808]  It's pharma.
[03:10:46.968 --> 03:10:49.249]  Everything is spending money from the government.
[03:10:49.329 --> 03:10:50.809]  And so in closing, let me raise that.
[03:10:51.089 --> 03:10:53.210]  The big front and center threat is Zelensky.
[03:10:53.610 --> 03:10:54.850]  I don't like the Russians invading.
[03:10:54.930 --> 03:10:55.911]  I'm not choosing a side.
[03:10:57.614 --> 03:10:58.555]  NATO started the war.
[03:10:58.595 --> 03:10:59.916]  They overthrew the government eight years ago.
[03:10:59.976 --> 03:11:00.456]  We all know that.
[03:11:00.476 --> 03:11:04.559]  Your dad made great films exposing it way before predicting it would all happen.
[03:11:05.040 --> 03:11:07.842]  But now they fire a missile 100 miles out of bounds.
[03:11:07.942 --> 03:11:09.903]  I say it's an anti-aircraft missile.
[03:11:09.923 --> 03:11:10.704]  They later confirm it.
[03:11:10.984 --> 03:11:12.165]  And the Pentagon says it doesn't matter.
[03:11:12.205 --> 03:11:13.306]  It's still Russia's fault.
[03:11:13.706 --> 03:11:19.191]  And Zelensky calls for Article 5 to be invoked and NATO to attack Russia, which will lead to nuclear war.
[03:11:19.651 --> 03:11:20.872]  These people are out of their minds.
[03:11:21.152 --> 03:11:22.073]  Yeah, well, we know this.
[03:11:22.113 --> 03:11:23.233]  I mean, why haven't they gone for peace?
[03:11:23.273 --> 03:11:28.656]  I mean, the point was that we could have had a peace deal pretty quickly during, you know, right after the invasion.
[03:11:29.136 --> 03:11:32.598]  There was opportunity for peace, and Zelensky and company pulled out, right?
[03:11:32.638 --> 03:11:33.699]  And so, and the U.S.
[03:11:33.739 --> 03:11:35.540]  has not pushed for peace since that time.
[03:11:35.620 --> 03:11:43.104]  So here, you know, even Russell Brand is making fun of Biden, going, this guy is sitting there like an old man on the side of the porch going, you know, if we stay on this course, there's going to be a nuclear war.
[03:11:43.404 --> 03:11:44.765]  It's like, why don't you do something about it?
[03:11:44.825 --> 03:11:46.446]  Maybe, you know, maybe move towards peace.
[03:11:46.466 --> 03:11:46.926]  Why don't you?
[03:11:47.406 --> 03:11:48.327]  It's, they're insane.
[03:11:48.607 --> 03:11:50.069]  And people take it as a Russian loss.
[03:11:50.149 --> 03:11:52.512]  They've got 100,000 dead troops, reportedly 100,000 dead Ukrainians.
[03:11:52.572 --> 03:11:52.712]  No.
[03:11:53.012 --> 03:11:55.776]  This is a real giant war in Europe.
[03:11:55.796 --> 03:11:56.577]  This has got to stop.
[03:11:58.044 --> 03:12:01.125]  I mean, without question, war is slaughter.
[03:12:01.665 --> 03:12:32.866]   War is what they need when they want to create chaos and do more controlling, and another way to disguise the central bankers and their incredible, irresponsible debt ocean that they've created for mankind, and they want to keep hold of control, so that's why they're going to try and bring in that central bank digital currency, which will be A control system that I think would be the closest thing to being driven insane by how you have no more freedom anymore.
[03:12:33.106 --> 03:12:37.929]  Unless you're willing to sort of run around the woods and spare rabbits and live in a tree or something.
[03:12:38.189 --> 03:12:41.031]  And even then they'll probably like send a drone and put a bullet in your head.
[03:12:41.591 --> 03:12:47.756]  By the way, I just want to really say it again, or say, expand on this.
[03:12:47.977 --> 03:12:51.960]  You've got to teach yourself about the technology of psyops.
[03:12:52.560 --> 03:12:56.484]  Because unless you understand how it works, you're going to be vulnerable to it.
[03:12:56.924 --> 03:13:01.588]  And there are certainly many places that you can find information about psyops.
[03:13:01.648 --> 03:13:12.534]   But if you also look at the history of psychiatry, And Edward Bernays, and the ways in which spies are taught how to be spies.
[03:13:13.015 --> 03:13:18.337]  You're going to understand more about how you're being manipulated, so that you can catch it when it happens.
[03:13:18.837 --> 03:13:25.360]  I mean, most of us are kind and good-hearted people, so it's... That's right, if you're not aware that there's a war on for your mind, you're basically gonna lose.
[03:13:25.700 --> 03:13:26.701]  That's right, that's right.
[03:13:27.581 --> 03:13:28.081]  Exactly.
[03:13:28.101 --> 03:13:31.523]  Which is another reason why InfoWars is so incredibly important.
[03:13:32.116 --> 03:13:33.317]  Well, I appreciate you guys.
[03:13:33.337 --> 03:13:46.907]  What I'm happy about is I see so many great new talk show hosts and other talk show hosts really waking up that now, you know, because Sean's been doing this forever, so have I. You've obviously been awake a long time, Vivian, but there's so many new people popping up.
[03:13:47.348 --> 03:13:49.189]  I don't think their attempt to shut this down is going to work.
[03:13:49.469 --> 03:13:54.151]  No, it's like every time they take one out, a hundred are born and it metastasizes, right?
[03:13:54.171 --> 03:13:55.391]  And that's the beauty of this thing.
[03:13:55.431 --> 03:14:04.335]  It's like the more that, oh, we censor one, a thousand, you know, you end up with, look, Rumble and Bitch Shoot have popped up ever since YouTube started banning, you know, conspiracy theorists, right?
[03:14:04.775 --> 03:14:13.958]   So it's just the inevitability of human consciousness that the more they try to target and censor, the more it actually leads to more people waking up and going, Maybe Kyrie is right.
[03:14:14.178 --> 03:14:15.119]  Maybe Kanye is right.
[03:14:15.639 --> 03:14:18.300]  And that's the key, is evil always loses.
[03:14:18.780 --> 03:14:21.921]  And it doesn't mean we're perfect in our resistance to it, but we're trying to be good.
[03:14:22.361 --> 03:14:24.341]  Trying to find a real future for everybody.
[03:14:24.361 --> 03:14:26.182]  We're not going to be happy until we do that.
[03:14:26.802 --> 03:14:29.422]  Shawn, you've got best-selling books, you've got films, everything.
[03:14:29.763 --> 03:14:31.163]  How do people find all your great work?
[03:14:31.443 --> 03:14:31.764]  Absolutely.
[03:14:31.784 --> 03:14:32.885]  SeanStone.info.
[03:14:33.586 --> 03:14:34.527]  That's the best place to go.
[03:14:34.607 --> 03:14:36.729]  Best Kept Secret is a must-watch docuseries.
[03:14:36.769 --> 03:14:38.612]  If you want to talk about PsyOps, it's in there.
[03:14:38.732 --> 03:14:41.855]  And your book about the Anglo-American establishment couldn't be out at a better time.
[03:14:41.935 --> 03:14:43.297]  The New World Order is available.
[03:14:43.317 --> 03:14:45.199]  I think you guys have it too from InfoWars.
[03:14:45.279 --> 03:14:47.322]  And everything is available through SeanStone.info.
[03:14:48.463 --> 03:14:49.886]  And Vivian, you're quite the enigma.
[03:14:49.906 --> 03:14:51.508]  I mean, I've been a big fan of your dad.
[03:14:51.849 --> 03:14:55.615]  Before I ever met you, I knew you worked on a lot of his films and the music for Full Metal Jacket.
[03:14:56.016 --> 03:15:00.343]  Getting to know you in the last 15 years has been great, and so I'm very honored that you come on my show and Sean's show.
[03:15:00.443 --> 03:15:01.404]  Isn't that about it?
[03:15:02.853 --> 03:15:03.133]  Sorry, what?
[03:15:03.153 --> 03:15:04.074]  I mean, how many shows do you do?
[03:15:04.094 --> 03:15:04.874]  You only go on a few shows.
[03:15:04.894 --> 03:15:08.015]  No, I think I can count it on one hand, and most of it is with you.
[03:15:08.035 --> 03:15:10.557]  Well, we're very honored to have you.
[03:15:10.577 --> 03:15:12.457]  Jade Eyre is about to take over.
[03:15:12.477 --> 03:15:13.878]  Vivian, 30-second closing comment?
[03:15:14.658 --> 03:15:20.121]  Just that if you want to find me, I'm on Gab at V-I-K-U 1111.
[03:15:20.381 --> 03:15:22.302]  So, V-I-K-U 1111.
[03:15:22.342 --> 03:15:26.324]  And next time you're on, hopefully come on soon, we'll put the lower third up.
[03:15:26.864 --> 03:15:27.484]  Say it one more time.
[03:15:27.504 --> 03:15:28.445]  People are going to be calling us.
[03:15:28.485 --> 03:15:29.165]  How do they find you?
[03:15:29.825 --> 03:15:35.950]  I'm on Gab because I got chucked off Twitter for saying that COVID was 97.7% non-lethal.
[03:15:36.450 --> 03:15:41.494]  Although, I now recently got a letter saying that I'll never be allowed back on because I broke too many rules.
[03:15:41.554 --> 03:15:44.397]  And they're never going to speak to me again, and they're never going to answer my emails.
[03:15:44.517 --> 03:15:45.578]  Well, they sure taught you.
[03:15:45.598 --> 03:15:48.700]  Now you're on the air reaching probably 3 million people watching right now.
[03:15:48.740 --> 03:15:50.141]  So Vivian Kubrick, search her on Gab.
[03:15:50.622 --> 03:15:52.723]  All right, the great Jade Iron takes over straight ahead.
[03:15:53.043 --> 03:15:54.585]  Sean Stone, Vivian Kubrick, thank you so much.
[03:15:54.965 --> 03:15:55.625]  Bye, everyone.
[03:15:55.826 --> 03:15:56.406]  Bye, everybody.
[03:15:56.446 --> 03:15:57.267]  Have a great weekend.
[03:15:57.287 --> 03:15:58.528]  Owen Schwerer comes up in 45 minutes.
[03:15:59.833 --> 03:16:00.053]  Cool.
[03:16:00.874 --> 03:16:10.560]  Communication, and again, the communication, the ability to communicate, but the ability to get you the latest information on what just happened.
[03:16:10.800 --> 03:16:19.906]  Let's say a nuke, when it goes off, goes off there, we'll know it, those of us who are able to communicate, but in essence you're watching the destruction.
[03:16:20.266 --> 03:16:27.547]   and they desire to have total control over all information, total information awareness and total information control.
[03:16:27.547 --> 03:16:36.306]   The satellite phone and the bivy stick are the only way that you can stay certain of being able to access different
[03:16:36.306 --> 03:16:38.985]  communication people that will have these.
[03:16:39.126 --> 03:16:41.487]  A lot of hams are getting the bivy stick.
[03:16:41.527 --> 03:16:43.169]  A lot of hams are getting satellite phones.
[03:16:43.529 --> 03:16:46.551]  So it's always important for people to understand.
[03:16:47.232 --> 03:16:59.561]  Once you begin to lose it up here, and you start to worry and fret, and it's the mindset of knowing what's going on takes away from the uncertainty that initiates panic.
[03:17:00.121 --> 03:17:01.362]  That's a powerful statement.
[03:17:01.503 --> 03:17:01.923]  Absolutely.
[03:17:01.943 --> 03:17:03.324]  People should go to InfoWarsPhone.com.
[03:17:03.344 --> 03:17:08.088]  That takes you to the big satellite store, and we get the sponsorship and the credit, so it's a win-win for all of us.
[03:17:08.589 --> 03:17:09.870]  Stay on air, plus you get ready.

[03:17:20.279 --> 03:17:22.400]  It's the calls you use that you get the monthly deal on.
[03:17:22.460 --> 03:17:23.481]  You can also call 941-955-1020.

[03:17:33.389 --> 03:17:33.929]  941-955-1020.
[03:17:33.989 --> 03:17:36.331]  But this is one of the no-brainers.
[03:17:36.371 --> 03:17:36.931]  You need a gun.

[03:17:38.833 --> 03:17:39.853]  You need water filtration.
[03:17:39.873 --> 03:17:40.714]  You need friends and family.
[03:17:40.754 --> 03:17:41.635]  That's all the best things.
[03:17:41.795 --> 03:17:44.517]  And you need a baby stick or a satellite phone right now.
[03:17:44.657 --> 03:17:45.718]  Infowarsphone.com.

[03:17:48.043 --> 03:17:48.905]  People need to get it.
[03:17:48.925 --> 03:17:49.907]  They need to learn how to use it.
[03:17:49.927 --> 03:17:50.608]  It's very easy.
[03:17:51.009 --> 03:17:51.430]  I use it.
[03:17:51.470 --> 03:17:52.272]  I've got it in my house.
[03:17:52.292 --> 03:17:53.034]  I've got it in the office.
[03:17:53.093 --> 03:18:01.813]  This is critical.

[03:20:11.623 --> 03:20:16.984]   You [MUSIC PLAYING]
[03:20:16.984 --> 03:20:18.304]  (upbeat music)
[03:20:18.175 --> 03:20:19.136]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:19.156 --> 03:20:21.437]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:20:21.697 --> 03:20:29.623]  I was listening to Vivian and Sean give their analysis of the way that we understand how the global power structure works.
[03:20:30.183 --> 03:20:34.426]  I was really happy to hear them referring to organized crime and the structure of organized crime.
[03:20:34.506 --> 03:20:35.827]  I gave an interview this week.
[03:20:36.807 --> 03:20:39.848]  On one of the largest true crime channels on YouTube, Sean Atwood.
[03:20:39.868 --> 03:20:40.889]  Shout out to Sean Atwood.
[03:20:41.389 --> 03:20:48.772]  We had a whole 30-minute discussion of the history of organized crime, how that ties into the assassination of JFK, most likely.
[03:20:48.812 --> 03:20:52.573]  That's one of the prevalent theories that seems to have the most evidence behind it.
[03:20:52.613 --> 03:21:02.417]  Of course, I think there's other power players as well behind the assassination of JFK, including intelligence agencies, including foreign governments, as well as organized crime and the mob.
[03:21:03.357 --> 03:21:15.070]  And I wanted to review a little bit of that because that's one of the first things I discussed in the fourth hour two years ago on the Alex Jones Show, having been hosting the fourth hour now for two years, a little over two years.
[03:21:16.251 --> 03:21:19.075]  Because this week it was big, big, big news.
[03:21:19.614 --> 03:21:24.135]  this huge dynamic scandal bigger than Enron now, right?
[03:21:24.135 --> 03:21:27.135]  This FTX, Sam Bateman, Freed scandal.
[03:21:27.135 --> 03:21:33.694]   And the more that you dig into this crazy rabbit hole, what you find out is that not only was this, you know,
[03:21:33.694 --> 03:21:38.673]   a big scam and they were stealing money, it was also funneled 40, $34 million
[03:21:38.673 --> 03:21:41.333]  to the Democratic Party for Biden.
[03:21:41.333 --> 03:21:48.174]   And we noticed that FTX as a platform popped up, you know, out of nowhere, seemingly about three years ago.
[03:21:48.174 --> 03:21:53.094]   And of course there were already large crypto exchanges that already existed like Binance, Coinbase.
[03:21:53.094 --> 03:22:00.854]   And then we have this sudden emerging thing on the scene with the face of the quasi autistic,
[03:22:00.854 --> 03:22:06.974]   Afro-minded man boob figure of Sam Bateman Freed, who's supposedly this genius that nobody, you know,
[03:22:06.974 --> 03:22:08.454]  he's way beyond everybody.
[03:22:08.453 --> 03:22:12.655]  He sleeps on a beanbag in his office and he's got floppy hair.
[03:22:14.224 --> 03:22:20.765]  He just happens to be best friends with Bill Clinton and they're so close and it's just all gonna be wonderful with all this crypto.
[03:22:21.325 --> 03:22:22.366]  And then what do we know?
[03:22:22.566 --> 03:22:23.126]  Shocker!
[03:22:23.386 --> 03:22:27.387]  It's a big, huge, bigger than Enron scam.
[03:22:28.867 --> 03:22:30.147]  And he's still tweeting.
[03:22:30.167 --> 03:22:50.238]   He's still trying to explain himself as this altruistic billionaire who wants to give all of his money away as he lives together with A goblin-faced creature, supposedly his, quote, girlfriend, that they all sleep together in a giant orgy with 10 people living in an apartment complex.
[03:22:50.318 --> 03:22:50.938]  I mean, come on.
[03:22:51.219 --> 03:22:53.921]  Does anybody really believe that this guy was running this?
[03:22:53.961 --> 03:22:58.765]  Well, it turns out, as if you listen to BitBoy's interviews, BitBoy has dug really deep into this.
[03:22:58.845 --> 03:23:03.229]  I think Owen had BitBoy on, and they talked about the background to this whole scandal.
[03:23:03.290 --> 03:23:14.417]   And over on BitBoy's channel, he's gone into depth with Other people who this Friedberg character who was involved in a famous early 2000s online poker scam.
[03:23:15.238 --> 03:23:21.163]  And so it seems like they sort of recruited in these people who had a history of running high level scams.
[03:23:21.943 --> 03:23:33.312]  And this was pumped up to the nth degree with all of these Hollywood people, all of these stars, all these famous people pointing out how amazing FTX was, FTX token, all this stuff.
[03:23:33.472 --> 03:23:39.681]   And it was and people are shocked At how fraudulent and fake all of this is turning out to be.
[03:23:41.622 --> 03:23:42.162]  Yes, there you go.
[03:23:42.182 --> 03:23:45.424]  Would you like to join these two in a round of coitus?
[03:23:48.627 --> 03:23:50.348]  I know everybody's tempted in the audience.
[03:23:50.568 --> 03:23:52.289]  Try to hold back your temptation there.
[03:23:53.230 --> 03:23:56.052]  Let's go take a cold shower real quick if you need to.
[03:23:56.832 --> 03:24:00.675]  If you're giving in to your base passions right now, but I'm just joking.
[03:24:01.756 --> 03:24:07.439]   This is no shocker because as I'm listening to everybody talking about It's a Ponzi scheme.
[03:24:07.499 --> 03:24:08.460]  It's a rug pull.
[03:24:08.740 --> 03:24:10.241]  There's nothing behind the tokens.
[03:24:10.301 --> 03:24:10.962]  It's fiat.
[03:24:10.982 --> 03:24:12.323]  They're taking all the money.
[03:24:13.525 --> 03:24:15.587]  That's exactly how the Federal Reserve works.
[03:24:16.207 --> 03:24:18.009]  It's like everybody's shocked.
[03:24:19.110 --> 03:24:23.754]  We'll wait till you find out that the Federal Reserve is the same scam system.
[03:24:24.455 --> 03:24:26.197]  It's a giant rug pull Ponzi scheme.
[03:24:27.157 --> 03:24:49.715]  And if you go back, you know, the creature from Jekyll Island, if you go back to Woodrow Wilson, Colonel Edwin Mandel House, who was the UK banking elite agent who helped get all that legislation through, who helped promote Woodrow Wilson, setting up and weaponizing the Federal Reserve System, which, by the way, is part of the Communist Manifesto.
[03:24:49.755 --> 03:24:52.837]  If you didn't know, you might think that communists don't like bankers.
[03:24:52.857 --> 03:24:56.040]  But in fact, if you remember, we did a whole breakdown of this famous book.
[03:24:56.846 --> 03:25:03.370]  No, in fact, communism has always had billionaire funding, as did fascism.
[03:25:03.390 --> 03:25:07.733]  Fascism has the exact same history as Professor Anthony Sutton has shown in his books.
[03:25:09.034 --> 03:25:21.081]  So it also turns out that there seems to be connections to MIT, the background of FTX, people at MIT, people in the finance department, people connected to some of those Epstein departments, it turns out.
[03:25:21.941 --> 03:25:23.162]  And why is that?
[03:25:23.322 --> 03:25:25.844]  Well, because this is a giant Ponzi scheme.
[03:25:26.590 --> 03:25:32.234]  A giant scam intended precisely to funnel people's money offshore.
[03:25:33.475 --> 03:25:40.681]  And again, if you are shocked by this, I can't stress how shocking it is to you to understand that the dollar is the same.
[03:25:42.443 --> 03:25:49.268]  You understand that they're doing the same thing with your tax money, with the dollar, especially when it moved off of the gold standard.
[03:25:49.918 --> 03:25:53.560]  But even prior to that, Dr. Carol Quigley, everybody knows all the hold up the books.
[03:25:54.321 --> 03:26:02.566]  It's just basically a show and tell book program over here in the fourth hour with me, your librarian nerd who does your homework for you.
[03:26:04.307 --> 03:26:10.731]  Dr. Carol Quigley talks about how the banker notes were always a fiat scam going back hundreds of years.
[03:26:11.471 --> 03:26:15.954]  And they would print up more notes and flood the society with notes.
[03:26:17.919 --> 03:26:22.600]  Beyond the actual gold holdings that they had, and that was part of this gold note scam.
[03:26:24.121 --> 03:26:36.443]  And so the same thing is the model for the central bank that was set up throughout the central bank, such as they set up throughout Europe, throughout the 1800s and the 1900s.
[03:26:36.924 --> 03:26:44.485]  And that became the model for the Bank for International Settlements, which is the World Reserve Bank of World Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve of Federal Reserves.
[03:26:44.565 --> 03:26:47.126]  It's the central Federal Reserve Bank of the world.
[03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:49.432]  Federal Reserve Banking System.
[03:26:49.633 --> 03:26:57.345]  They all are connected to that hub, and most people don't know about this by design, on purpose.
[03:26:58.707 --> 03:27:02.653]  And that's why it occupies a central section of Carol Quigley's Strategy and Hope.
[03:27:03.323 --> 03:27:06.665]  As well as a few other people who seem to have picked up on this over the years.
[03:27:06.705 --> 03:27:24.753]  A few economists and a few people have written on this, but for the most part, people just are mystified and they think it's like this big onion-layered scheme scam of all of these different, you know, economics and so the GDP and the jobs report and the this report and the that report and it's all a bunch of mystery and smoke and mirrors.
[03:27:25.574 --> 03:27:26.034]  And guess what?
[03:27:27.114 --> 03:27:28.815]  Guess what's behind all that smoke and mirrors?
[03:27:29.996 --> 03:27:35.401]   Well, it's not stacks of gold At Fort Knox, right?
[03:27:36.721 --> 03:27:39.303]  It's FTT scam tokens.
[03:27:39.523 --> 03:27:40.663]  It's the exact same thing.
[03:27:41.063 --> 03:27:44.184]  So if you're mad about FTX, or you think that, oh, crypto's a scam.
[03:27:44.305 --> 03:27:45.365]  It's not a scam.
[03:27:46.305 --> 03:27:47.566]  Many cryptos are scams.
[03:27:48.106 --> 03:27:50.627]  But you understand this has nothing to do, for example, with Bitcoin.
[03:27:50.667 --> 03:27:54.089]  Bitcoin is the preeminent inflationary.
[03:27:54.169 --> 03:27:55.009]  It's the hardest asset.
[03:27:55.069 --> 03:27:57.710]  It's completely inflationary resistant.
[03:27:58.707 --> 03:28:16.754]  Because it has the fixed number of coins that can never be inflated beyond the fixed number when the last Bitcoin is mined and so it's extremely rare and for that reason it is not like these kinds of Proof-of-stake coins that are all just printed out of thin air.
[03:28:17.154 --> 03:28:34.425]   These are all again literally modeled on the Federal Reserve System on the Enron style scam system and On the coming carbon scam system, when they pull out the rollout, the carbon credits and the carbon tokens and the carbon based cryptos, those are already starting to roll out.
[03:28:34.445 --> 03:28:34.805]  Guess what?
[03:28:35.305 --> 03:28:40.647]  They're the exact same model as FTX and all of the other collapsed scam models.
[03:28:41.027 --> 03:28:44.368]  Luna, Terra Luna, that collapsed, what, three or four months ago?
[03:28:44.608 --> 03:28:46.649]  Exact same scam model, exact same rug pull.
[03:28:47.373 --> 03:28:48.033]  Exact same.
[03:28:48.594 --> 03:28:52.495]  You can earn 30% by staking your coins, and it's just printed out of nowhere.
[03:28:52.515 --> 03:28:55.457]  That's all the scam stolen money, right?
[03:28:55.537 --> 03:28:57.778]  And they're gambling with your money that you put on the exchange.
[03:28:58.388 --> 03:28:58.909]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:28:58.949 --> 03:28:59.789]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:28:59.809 --> 03:29:00.130]  I'm your guest.

[03:31:00.353 --> 03:31:06.957]  In the modern world, where they convince a woman to get a job, the man to get a job, they inflate the currency so nobody can exist any other way because it's too expensive.
[03:31:07.238 --> 03:31:08.639]  The parents are out working all day.
[03:31:08.799 --> 03:31:11.560]  The school and the internet and the matrix raise your children.
[03:31:11.580 --> 03:31:14.883]  Your children go to school all day and be told things that you may not want them to learn.
[03:31:15.023 --> 03:31:18.385]  Then they sit on the internet and read things and watch things you may not want them to watch.
[03:31:18.425 --> 03:31:20.887]  You talk to them for 10 minutes at the end of the day, they go to bed.
[03:31:20.927 --> 03:31:27.951]  You're fighting with your 10 minutes against endless hours of the most entertaining programming or the most forceful programming.
[03:31:27.991 --> 03:31:28.952]  In school, it's forceful.
[03:31:29.192 --> 03:31:30.193]  On the internet, it's entertaining.
[03:31:30.473 --> 03:31:32.996]  Convincing them of ideas that you perhaps don't agree with.
[03:31:33.317 --> 03:31:34.518]  I've seen it myself on YouTube.
[03:31:34.538 --> 03:31:39.004]  I've seen a guy in America driving his car and his kids were in the back seat and he was arguing with them about an issue.
[03:31:39.504 --> 03:31:40.746]  And they was like, where did you hear that?
[03:31:40.966 --> 03:31:41.266]  School?
[03:31:41.467 --> 03:31:42.948]  He's like, why did the school tell you that?
[03:31:42.969 --> 03:31:43.449]  That's not true.
[03:31:43.489 --> 03:31:46.513]  And his own children are arguing with him because they learned it in school.
[03:31:46.653 --> 03:31:48.015]  Have you ever tried to take your children out of school?
[03:31:48.215 --> 03:31:48.735]  You'll get fined.
[03:31:48.775 --> 03:31:49.416]  You'll get in trouble.
[03:31:49.456 --> 03:31:50.658]  No, your kids have to go to school.
[03:31:50.818 --> 03:31:52.420]  You have to give your kids away to the school.
[03:31:52.680 --> 03:31:55.663]  If you don't give your kids away to the brainwashing, you'll get in trouble.
[03:31:56.044 --> 03:32:03.352]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker, and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has truly earned the title of Top G.
[03:32:04.053 --> 03:32:07.674]  But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged the globalists.
[03:32:08.075 --> 03:32:13.217]  He is consecutively the most googled man in the world in the last two years.
[03:32:13.437 --> 03:32:18.098]  And that's because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.
[03:32:18.579 --> 03:32:24.301]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.
[03:32:24.821 --> 03:32:27.202]  Introducing Top G Supplements.
[03:32:27.782 --> 03:32:32.784]  We are proud to introduce and sponsor the Top G line of supplements by Andrew Tate and his crew.

[03:33:01.778 --> 03:33:05.883]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:33:06.203 --> 03:33:07.963]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:07.963 --> 03:33:17.643]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:17.697 --> 03:33:19.557]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[03:33:19.577 --> 03:33:24.139]  I want to remind you, if you notice there on the screen, you'll see that second box there.
[03:33:24.240 --> 03:33:32.743]  It's one of my biggest interviews I've done to date, and that is with Colonel Douglas McGregor, who was Trump's pick for National Security Advisor.
[03:33:32.804 --> 03:33:34.624]  He did not get that post.
[03:33:34.664 --> 03:33:35.705]  That was blocked, I think.
[03:33:36.005 --> 03:33:37.726]  That involved Mitch McConnell, if I recall.
[03:33:38.526 --> 03:33:41.889]  Colonel McGregor is a frequent guest on Tucker Carlson.
[03:33:41.929 --> 03:33:55.398]  You may have seen him or heard of him, and we did a full hour breakdown of everything from the Great Reset to FTX scam token, Sam Bateman Freed style Federal Reserve stuff, to the Ukraine situation, Russia, etc.
[03:33:55.438 --> 03:33:56.499]  It was an amazing interview.
[03:33:56.539 --> 03:33:58.520]  It's, again, one of the biggest I've done to date.
[03:33:58.961 --> 03:34:01.462]  Be sure and go to my YouTube channel and check that out.
[03:34:01.522 --> 03:34:09.768]   It's getting a lot of attention, a lot of good feedback, so if you're looking for a deeper breakdown from From a high-profile individual, definitely go check that out.
[03:34:09.808 --> 03:34:19.993]  And also, I would add, today, I'm going to be uploading, we had earlier in the last hour, Alex had the children of two of the most famous directors.
[03:34:20.053 --> 03:34:26.156]  I just did an interview with one of the other most famous directors, his son, Andre Tarkovsky Jr.
[03:34:26.196 --> 03:34:45.157]   So if you're familiar with Tarkovsky's films, And the amazing art that he put out over the years, films like S.T.A.L.K.E.R., films like Solaris, films like Rublev, sort of capturing the history and the essence of Eurasia and Russia, especially in art and iconography.
[03:34:45.357 --> 03:34:51.703]   We went really deep into the breakdown of Andre Jr.' 's documentary that he put out.
[03:34:51.803 --> 03:34:53.304]  It's now at the Criterion Collection.
[03:34:54.205 --> 03:34:56.888]  Send him a prayer about his father, about Andre Tarkovsky.
[03:34:56.948 --> 03:35:06.438]  So Tarkovsky, of course, being hugely influential as well in the global film scene, influencing many, many filmmakers in the West, in Hollywood as well.
[03:35:08.032 --> 03:35:09.393]  And so you definitely want to check that out.
[03:35:09.433 --> 03:35:11.413]  I'll be premiering that on my channel this week as well.
[03:35:11.453 --> 03:35:14.535]  It's also already available on my ROKFN channel.
[03:35:14.555 --> 03:35:22.197]  So if you're looking for information like that, that's a little edgier, a little sooner than other stuff, you can subscribe to me over on ROKFN.
[03:35:22.217 --> 03:35:24.979]  I think Greg Reese is maybe coming over to ROKFN as well.
[03:35:25.039 --> 03:35:26.779]  Paul Joseph Watson's on ROKFN too.
[03:35:26.819 --> 03:35:29.060]  So a lot of cool stuff over there.
[03:35:30.540 --> 03:35:33.820]   You know, we were talking about this scam model, how the scams work.
[03:35:33.820 --> 03:35:46.219]   And these scams are structured in the way that a lot of intelligence agencies have structured
[03:35:46.219 --> 03:35:53.820]   secrets and cells, secret societies and cells over the years. And so if we think about how, for example,
[03:35:54.688 --> 03:36:19.785]   Organized crime set up the the the secret societies that they had we go back to Sicily in the 1800s 1700s This is the the origin of the omerta which is a secret oath a death oath that you make to your dawn to the dawn of the local That's almost a militia, but the militias are actually the local militias is where we get the idea of a The Sicilian Mafia.
[03:36:19.825 --> 03:36:34.515]  Now, when a lot of the immigrants came over to the U.S., they didn't find a lot of help with the existing local police, so naturally they would continue their model of local neighborhood militia, and that's where we get the ideas of the Don and this kind of stuff.
[03:36:34.535 --> 03:37:09.783]   But the Omerta, the secret ritual, which is actually a copy from certain Masonic rituals and Masonic groups out of Italy, known as the Carbonari, they copied this, and that's because One of the early Italian revolutionaries, his name was Garibaldi, he was influenced by Giuseppe Mazzini, who was one of the most famous, there you go, exactly, this is the Omerta scene in Sopranos, and I'm sure if you've never seen the Sopranos, I highly recommend checking it out, because there's a lot of gabagool, a lot of gabagool!
[03:37:11.147 --> 03:37:15.991]  A lot of gabagool, a lot of goomars and a lot of goombahs up in the Sopranos, but it's a great show.
[03:37:16.251 --> 03:37:30.682]  We did a whole two-hour breakdown of that show, by the way, if you're looking for a great podcast, getting into all the really insightful elements in that show, including, there's the Omeretor right there, where you burn the image of the saint and you sort of take a blood oath.
[03:37:31.900 --> 03:37:36.763]  But there's also references to, you know, the tie-in with organized crime and intelligence agencies.
[03:37:37.243 --> 03:37:41.985]  There's references to the CIA, to Tony having to, at times, collude with the FBI.
[03:37:42.386 --> 03:37:45.267]  All of that comes up in that show consistently throughout.
[03:37:45.867 --> 03:37:48.229]  Yeah, I think one of the best TV shows ever made, honestly.
[03:37:49.849 --> 03:38:00.115]  But it's instructive, again, because as you heard Vivian, I think, mention in the last hour, you know, the organized crime model is really the best way to understand how the global elites run things.
[03:38:01.403 --> 03:38:04.184]  This may sound like, oh yeah, of course, there's organized crime.
[03:38:04.204 --> 03:38:05.004]  Yeah, we all know that.
[03:38:05.485 --> 03:38:13.528]  But people just still can't figure out there's this block in their head, this roadblock between there being organized crime and global organized crime.
[03:38:13.608 --> 03:38:14.768]  They just cannot figure this out.
[03:38:14.808 --> 03:38:19.670]  They cannot figure out that giant pharmaceutical corporations operate like organized crime.
[03:38:20.250 --> 03:38:25.432]  They can't figure out that giant international banking institutions operate like organized crime.
[03:38:25.472 --> 03:38:30.844]   Now, we just had a giant institution that collapsed Guess what?
[03:38:30.965 --> 03:38:32.866]  It's operating on an organized crime model.
[03:38:33.487 --> 03:38:36.750]  And it's not run by nerdy dude with an afro.
[03:38:37.491 --> 03:38:38.352]  He's the face of that.
[03:38:38.412 --> 03:38:39.112]  He's the front of that.
[03:38:39.173 --> 03:38:41.775]  And the face, the front people, they take the fall.
[03:38:41.915 --> 03:38:44.177]  And the media right now is running cover for him.
[03:38:44.938 --> 03:38:46.840]  Mainstream media is running cover for Sam Beckman.
[03:38:46.920 --> 03:38:48.181]  Oh, he's altruistic.
[03:38:48.241 --> 03:38:49.062]  It's not his fault.
[03:38:49.703 --> 03:38:50.824]  It's all these other people.
[03:38:51.559 --> 03:39:02.704]  Well, yeah, maybe he's just he's just a front man, but they're covering up because they know it shows that the giant establishment leftist, especially Democratic Party system is a big scam.
[03:39:04.084 --> 03:39:05.865]  And it totally exposes all that.
[03:39:07.726 --> 03:39:10.187]  And it exposes that because it's kind of always been that way.
[03:39:10.467 --> 03:39:10.687]  All right.
[03:39:10.727 --> 03:39:15.429]  And I'm not saying that the Republican Party doesn't have a much of a phonies and con artists as well.
[03:39:15.509 --> 03:39:18.571]  I mean, it's they're they're basically the same party for the most part.
[03:39:18.611 --> 03:39:18.751]  Right.
[03:39:19.964 --> 03:39:26.942]  A few outliers and people that, you know, people on this broadcast all know about, for the most part, these people are all part of the same big scam.
[03:39:28.224 --> 03:39:38.391]  And crypto was just one of those easier ways to kind of mask the scammery by selling people on the idea that the Federal Reserve model of fiat system.
[03:39:38.511 --> 03:39:40.212]  Oh, let's just put that into crypto.
[03:39:40.292 --> 03:39:50.660]  Do the exact same thing where we can print up infinite amounts of digits on the screen and just say, oh, yeah, well, there's there's a zillion FDT token and we'll just keep inflating the price of the fake coin.
[03:39:51.380 --> 03:39:57.084]  And as people invest, they will take the investor's money and put it into his own betting and investments.
[03:39:57.982 --> 03:40:07.368]  And, you know, again, it's obvious that this is just the exact same model of the Federal Reserve scam debt based system applied to the crypto world.
[03:40:07.928 --> 03:40:14.291]  And the whole point of Bitcoin itself, Bitcoin, which has nothing to do with any of these things, none of these scams.
[03:40:15.092 --> 03:40:18.774]  Bitcoin exists to fight that model.
[03:40:19.334 --> 03:40:20.215]  That's its purpose.
[03:40:21.244 --> 03:40:26.525]  So, you know, I think a lot of people kind of we were open to the possibility of where Ethereum might go.
[03:40:26.605 --> 03:40:32.847]  Ethereum was for many, many years based on this idea of proof of work like Bitcoin model.
[03:40:33.707 --> 03:40:38.549]  And then it recently switched to, quote, proof of stake and admitted to the censoring.
[03:40:39.309 --> 03:40:45.911]  So Tornado Cash, these other recent scandals in the domain of Ethereum have proven that Ethereum is now part of GlobalCoin.
[03:40:46.131 --> 03:40:47.731]  In fact, Klaus even says he likes it now.
[03:40:47.771 --> 03:40:48.911]  I like the Ethereum.
[03:40:49.432 --> 03:40:50.712]  We will go over the Ethereum.
[03:40:51.343 --> 03:40:55.549]  So while we might have withheld judgment and been open to the possibility, now it's gone into full on.
[03:40:55.609 --> 03:41:01.616]  It's part of, apparently, it seems like it wants to go in the direction of KlausCoin, GlobalCoin.
[03:41:02.578 --> 03:41:09.627]  Because now they're willing to admit censoring when they're requested to censor at the node level.
[03:41:10.709 --> 03:41:12.531]  And that's not what Bitcoin is.
[03:41:12.591 --> 03:41:14.192]  Bitcoin is not that, you see.
[03:41:14.332 --> 03:41:15.093]  So it's different.
[03:41:15.213 --> 03:41:18.856]  So a lot of people who don't know about this sector, they kind of class it all together.
[03:41:18.876 --> 03:41:22.039]  And every time there's a shakeout, oh, it's because it's all a scam.
[03:41:22.079 --> 03:41:22.960]  It's not all a scam.
[03:41:23.620 --> 03:41:27.423]  That's why all of these other coins are not modeled like Bitcoin is modeled.
[03:41:27.623 --> 03:41:27.864]  Right.
[03:41:27.964 --> 03:41:31.747]  And so, again, it sort of vindicates Max Keiser in a way, right?
[03:41:32.187 --> 03:41:33.649]  Max Keiser, Max Keiser, Bitcoin.
[03:41:33.969 --> 03:41:35.290]  Bitcoin is vindicated.
[03:41:35.848 --> 03:41:38.990]  Because it's all the Bitcoin people, right?
[03:41:39.050 --> 03:41:46.836]  Michael Saylor, Max Keiser, who had been saying for the last year that these entities are going to start collapsing.
[03:41:46.936 --> 03:41:49.318]  You're going to see, you know, this Three Arrows Capital.
[03:41:49.338 --> 03:41:50.259]  You're going to see Voyager.
[03:41:50.279 --> 03:41:52.640]  You're going to see Terra Luna.
[03:41:52.660 --> 03:41:57.264]  You're going to see, because the same model had been done in the past through exchanges like Mt.
[03:41:57.304 --> 03:41:59.525]  Gox, which got hacked many, many years ago.
[03:41:59.886 --> 03:42:08.290]   BitConnect was another one of these Ponzi scams that collapsed based on Paying people out of money, tokens made out of thin air, basically.
[03:42:08.570 --> 03:42:09.971]  So these are all just scam models.
[03:42:10.131 --> 03:42:11.051]  That's all I'm trying to say.
[03:42:11.651 --> 03:42:14.372]  And that doesn't mean that everybody or everything in crypto is a scam.
[03:42:14.392 --> 03:42:15.852]  That's why it wasn't about Bitcoin.
[03:42:16.672 --> 03:42:18.553]  It was about everything but Bitcoin, you see.
[03:42:20.493 --> 03:42:23.174]  And most of the global elites don't like Bitcoin.
[03:42:23.854 --> 03:42:24.675]  Openly, right?
[03:42:24.695 --> 03:42:27.715]  Bill Gates, I wish we never had Bitcoin, right?
[03:42:27.755 --> 03:42:29.096]  Hillary, get rid of Bitcoin.
[03:42:29.736 --> 03:42:33.637]  They all do not like that because that's one of the ones that they can't control.
[03:42:34.381 --> 03:42:36.102]  Because it's actually decentralized.
[03:42:36.522 --> 03:42:42.826]  These other ones are completely centralized and are based on the print-out-of-thin-air scam debt model.
[03:42:43.146 --> 03:42:44.527]  That is the Federal Reserve model.
[03:42:44.967 --> 03:42:56.293]  And that's why this was all promoted for the last three years with zillions of dollars by all these Democrats and all these, you know, Wall Street CNBC people to pump this up because it was a scam.
[03:42:57.862 --> 03:42:58.403]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:42:58.443 --> 03:42:59.283]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:42:59.102 --> 03:43:02.882]   show me guess those J dot. One of the biggest news stories lately has been
[03:43:02.882 --> 03:43:07.742]   Elon Musk purchasing Twitter at the hopes for many that free speech would be
[03:43:07.742 --> 03:43:12.742]   restored on the platform. Elon Musk has hinted at this himself but when he spoke
[03:43:12.742 --> 03:43:18.422]   out against returning Alex Jones to the platform there were obvious concerns. Now
[03:43:18.422 --> 03:43:22.981]   what I think might be going on Elon Musk is making a business decision knowing
[03:43:22.981 --> 03:43:27.182]   that if Alex Jones is allowed back on the platform Twitter might get removed
[03:43:27.182 --> 03:43:29.182]  from the App Store.
[03:43:29.123 --> 03:43:30.944]  Oh, you can't have it on your iPhone.
[03:43:31.124 --> 03:43:33.146]  Oh, you can't have it on your Android anymore.
[03:43:33.526 --> 03:43:43.733]  And now that one of the head tech executives and app manufacturers at Apple has removed his account could be a sign of things to come.
[03:43:43.793 --> 03:43:50.118]  Now others think it might be a personal choice that Elon Musk made to not let Alex Jones back on the platform.
[03:43:50.498 --> 03:43:55.802]  Now here was Alex Jones response to the news of Elon Musk not reinstating his account.
[03:43:56.022 --> 03:44:25.510]   The ADL And the Southern Primary Law Center, the Democratic Party, the European Union, and the Justice Department and CIA moles that Congress had hearings on last week are inside of his company right now and are literally trying to sabotage it, not just externally with threats of lawsuits and censorship and criminal charges from the EU, but they're also threatening to sabotage the company and the actual systems that make it operate.
[03:44:26.830 --> 03:44:42.895]   He hit the panic button and basically came out and attacked me so that he can get the left off of his back and you know that it's it's it's fine to me that he did that except he went too far and compared himself to Jesus and the whole Bring the children to me.
[03:44:43.336 --> 03:44:44.337]  Suffer the children to me.
[03:44:44.357 --> 03:44:51.067]  And if you offend one of these, if you're mean to one of these kids, it's better for you to kill yourself by tying a big bolt to your neck and throwing it in the ocean.
[03:44:51.628 --> 03:44:52.589]  That's just outrageous.
[03:44:52.609 --> 03:44:57.075]  That's absolutely outrageous that I'm supposedly the worst guy in the world because of media hype.
[03:44:57.776 --> 03:44:58.816]  But that story will carry itself out.
[03:44:58.635 --> 03:45:01.135]  has misrepresented what I really said about Sandy Hook.
[03:45:01.135 --> 03:45:05.135]   If Elon loves to quote Christ so much in between dressing up like Satan,
[03:45:05.135 --> 03:45:11.135]   he should quote Christ's most famous quote, "Let he without sin cast the first stone."
[03:45:11.135 --> 03:45:14.135]  But that story will carry itself out.

[03:47:07.915 --> 03:47:17.274]  Peace out.
[03:47:17.275 --> 03:47:18.256]  Do you copy, guy?
[03:47:18.757 --> 03:47:19.678]  Do you copy, guy?
[03:47:20.504 --> 03:47:21.044]  I'm just joking.
[03:47:21.064 --> 03:47:22.185]  That's my entertained impression.
[03:47:22.205 --> 03:47:23.805]  But welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.825 --> 03:47:25.086]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[03:47:25.605 --> 03:47:35.005]   we were talking about the structures of large scale scammery, large scale deception, large scale financial
[03:47:35.005 --> 03:47:42.284]   bamboozlery and particularly the Federal Reserve System is kind of actually pretty much the same
[03:47:42.284 --> 03:47:46.944]  as the FTX collapse scandal system.
[03:47:46.944 --> 03:47:48.944]  So there's been a lot of these as we pointed out.
[03:47:48.944 --> 03:47:53.386]   And the reason I was bringing in organized crime is that one thing organized crime got pretty adept at
[03:47:53.386 --> 03:47:57.386]  is I guess still pretty adept at is financial scammery.
[03:47:57.381 --> 03:48:04.525]  So we often think of, you know, mobsters, organized crime as, you know, being involved in a little bit of sanitation.
[03:48:04.565 --> 03:48:08.767]  They take out the dead body, take out a little bit of the trash.
[03:48:08.787 --> 03:48:10.068]  Now, but that's not all they do.
[03:48:10.668 --> 03:48:14.610]  Organized crime is also involved pretty heavily in large scale financial scammery.
[03:48:15.296 --> 03:48:17.518]  And that actually comes up throughout The Sopranos as well.
[03:48:17.539 --> 03:48:24.606]  There's many episodes where Tony gets involved in a big-scale gentrification HUD type of scam, right?
[03:48:24.746 --> 03:48:26.828]  And that's referenced, I think, in season one or two.
[03:48:27.269 --> 03:48:31.513]  Very similar to the stuff that Catherine Austin Fitts had investigated amazingly.
[03:48:33.536 --> 03:48:44.724]  There's a couple other episodes where, you know, Tony gets involved in these high level financial scams that at one point he sets up a front thing that has to do with stock scams, right?
[03:48:44.985 --> 03:48:47.807]  And stock trading and whatnot.
[03:48:47.827 --> 03:48:53.531]  And he puts a couple guys running this and that works for a little while and makes maybe a few million dollars, something like that.
[03:48:54.372 --> 03:49:01.237]  And so but those are models on a micro scale for what big scale scammers do on a macro scale.
[03:49:01.916 --> 03:49:06.716]   And it's just amazing to me that people can figure this out at the local level.
[03:49:06.716 --> 03:49:12.015]   They can figure it out that maybe even their governor at a state level,
[03:49:12.015 --> 03:49:17.916]   maybe even the president or some government official is involved in a scam.
[03:49:17.916 --> 03:49:23.016]   But they can't figure it out beyond these goofy public official people,
[03:49:23.016 --> 03:49:25.716]  as if there aren't billionaires involved in scams.
[03:49:25.859 --> 03:49:32.223]  As if there aren't people, you know, like FTX scale people, multi-billion dollar scams.
[03:49:32.904 --> 03:49:40.970]  Now everybody knows about Enron, everybody knows about Bernie Madoff, and now everybody knows about FTX, but do you think that that's it?
[03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:45.133]  Like that that's the only scams that go on, or that's the only deception that goes on?
[03:49:45.293 --> 03:49:47.694]  You don't think that it goes on at the level of the Federal Reserve?
[03:49:48.355 --> 03:49:50.997]  Doesn't go on the level of the Bank for International Settlements?
[03:49:53.183 --> 03:49:55.824]  What about the level of Davos and the World Economic Forum?
[03:49:56.184 --> 03:49:59.225]  Could they possibly be involved in economic scammery?
[03:49:59.285 --> 03:50:05.647]  Or do you think that they're all altruistic people who want to help you, like Sam Bankman-Fried?
[03:50:07.148 --> 03:50:08.728]  Are they just sweet, nice people?
[03:50:10.249 --> 03:50:11.889]  They care about your health.
[03:50:13.110 --> 03:50:16.111]  They want you to be happy and healthy, while they also want you to not be around.
[03:50:17.610 --> 03:50:19.472]  I mean, how can people not figure this out?
[03:50:20.213 --> 03:50:21.434]  I'm mystified by this.
[03:50:21.494 --> 03:50:28.600]  And so my point of this is that, well, how do we understand Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX and then the Democratic Party connection there?
[03:50:28.721 --> 03:50:29.641]  Well, it's like mafia.
[03:50:29.661 --> 03:50:30.502]  It's like organized crime.
[03:50:31.583 --> 03:50:33.325]  You got to work for the big boys.
[03:50:34.266 --> 03:50:37.509]  You know, we'll promote you on the global stage for the next three years.
[03:50:38.249 --> 03:50:39.751]  Sam, come work for us.
[03:50:40.623 --> 03:50:51.326]  You'd be the nerdy tech face of crypto because, presumably, from the psychological warfare vantage point, from the market research, the only people into crypto are nerds.
[03:50:53.387 --> 03:50:54.487]  So you're the face of it.
[03:50:55.708 --> 03:50:59.569]  Maybe other Silicon Valley companies with nerdy face people are the same, you think?
[03:50:59.969 --> 03:51:00.249]  You think?
[03:51:00.489 --> 03:51:00.769]  Maybe?
[03:51:01.290 --> 03:51:03.230]  Maybe something like Facebook is something?
[03:51:03.250 --> 03:51:03.710]  I don't know.
[03:51:03.790 --> 03:51:04.251]  What do you think?
[03:51:04.271 --> 03:51:04.871]  I don't know.
[03:51:04.891 --> 03:51:05.751]  What do you think?
[03:51:05.791 --> 03:51:06.451]  Think about this.
[03:51:06.511 --> 03:51:07.952]  Maybe this is a model for other things.
[03:51:08.012 --> 03:51:08.352]  I don't know.
[03:51:10.800 --> 03:51:13.322]  And then you do what we say.
[03:51:13.883 --> 03:51:20.569]  However, if things go sour, maybe you don't pay your dues.
[03:51:22.751 --> 03:51:23.271]  What happens?
[03:51:24.072 --> 03:51:24.953]  Well, you take the fall.
[03:51:26.234 --> 03:51:27.455]  You're the fall guy.
[03:51:27.615 --> 03:51:31.238]  You're the man that is the face of this, and you're the one that calls all this.
[03:51:31.519 --> 03:51:39.911]   Maybe we'll run a little interference for you for the mainstream media, and we'll try to say that You know, you're just this autistic, genius, savant, nerd guy.
[03:51:39.951 --> 03:51:47.192]  But no, ultimately, right, this guy might take the fall as if it's just one guy.
[03:51:47.212 --> 03:51:50.333]  And that's another lie the system's always propping up, right?
[03:51:50.393 --> 03:51:51.793]  Like, oh, it's just this one dude.
[03:51:51.853 --> 03:51:52.533]  It's one.
[03:51:52.953 --> 03:51:54.514]  We got one bad apple over here.
[03:51:54.554 --> 03:51:55.574]  We'll root the bad apples.
[03:51:55.694 --> 03:52:00.475]  As if this is not a gigantor scam with obviously a lot of high level connections.
[03:52:01.395 --> 03:52:07.949]   But of course, the high level people, the Dons, Not Don Trump, the Dons.
[03:52:08.069 --> 03:52:11.290]  The Don in the sense of the mob Don, right?
[03:52:11.310 --> 03:52:23.634]  The structure of the mafia, if you didn't know this, the reason that it was so successful for many decades in the 30s, 40s and 50s was a cell model where a lot of the foot soldiers, they didn't actually know who was running things.
[03:52:25.735 --> 03:52:29.516]  They might know about the Don, but they might not even meet him very much, right?
[03:52:29.536 --> 03:52:31.737]  So they don't really know, it's compartmentalized.
[03:52:31.797 --> 03:52:32.857]  It's a cell structure.
[03:52:34.290 --> 03:52:43.499]  And it was so successful and hard to bust because a lot of the soldiers, they would interact with the bosses, but the boss alone interacted with the Don.
[03:52:44.420 --> 03:52:49.766]  And so that's one way, one model by which this type of thing was so successful.
[03:52:50.326 --> 03:52:52.849]  And that's also portrayed throughout The Sopranos as well.
[03:52:54.043 --> 03:52:56.445]  Because remember, you know, Tony's not really a Don.
[03:52:56.565 --> 03:52:59.327]  Tony is a boss, right?
[03:52:59.347 --> 03:53:00.848]  And he's got soldiers under him.
[03:53:00.908 --> 03:53:07.092]  But, you know, Tony has to interact with and deal with the Dons of the five families, right?
[03:53:07.132 --> 03:53:12.435]  And so every now and then he'll have to drive over to New York and talk to the various Dons.
[03:53:14.096 --> 03:53:16.077]  But Tony's not exactly at that level.
[03:53:16.097 --> 03:53:17.298]  He's sort of below that.
[03:53:19.432 --> 03:53:28.242]  And so he's oftentimes having to get Christopher, the main foot soldier throughout the series, to go and do all these operations and run all this stuff.
[03:53:28.342 --> 03:53:30.324]  But Christopher has to pay his cut.
[03:53:31.784 --> 03:53:32.004]  Right.
[03:53:32.284 --> 03:53:38.126]  When he gets made, if you remember in the show, that comes with new responsibilities.
[03:53:38.306 --> 03:53:38.446]  Right.
[03:53:38.466 --> 03:53:41.467]  So Christopher, his whole life, he lacks his father figure.
[03:53:41.507 --> 03:53:42.288]  He looks up to Tony.
[03:53:42.328 --> 03:53:51.711]  Tony plays this father figure role when he finally gets made from, you know, being just sort of a thug to a made man.
[03:53:52.705 --> 03:53:55.006]  With status, it comes with all these responsibilities.
[03:53:55.046 --> 03:53:57.328]  And now he has to give you even more money, right?
[03:53:57.368 --> 03:53:58.549]  Now he owes more money.
[03:53:58.769 --> 03:54:05.173]  He has to do more scammery, more operations to bring Tony a bigger cut.
[03:54:05.653 --> 03:54:14.718]  So all what he thought was all this power and prestige and honor was actually just even further signing his soul over to the devil.
[03:54:14.758 --> 03:54:22.203]  And that's actually a big part of the show where over time, you know, Christopher starts to realize that he's basically made a deal with the devil.
[03:54:23.367 --> 03:54:30.268]  And this ends up in him having an after death or near death experience right where he gets shot and he sees himself in hell.
[03:54:31.353 --> 03:54:34.156]  And he relates this, you know, throughout, midway throughout the show.
[03:54:34.196 --> 03:54:43.044]  Anyway, the point is just that this is the model for understanding how the elite in our day run things on a grander scale.
[03:54:43.364 --> 03:54:44.165]  It's the exact same.
[03:54:44.625 --> 03:54:47.548]  And that was the point Vivian Kubrick was making in the previous hour.
[03:54:47.608 --> 03:54:49.289]  So hopefully everybody caught that.
[03:54:49.369 --> 03:54:55.274]  And, you know, Sean Stone was making the same point with secret societies and spies and spy networks and all that.
[03:54:55.334 --> 03:54:58.037]  It's the same stuff with this, right, with organized crime.
[03:54:58.983 --> 03:55:02.844]  And, you know, that's what this is, you know, controlling the black markets, right?
[03:55:02.984 --> 03:55:14.809]  Brzezinski, he made that famous comment that it wasn't just a matter of, you know, in terms of geopolitics, controlling legitimate markets, it was also necessary to control the black markets.
[03:55:15.109 --> 03:55:21.711]  That's a big part of controlling things on the geopolitical grand chessboard, running black markets as well.
[03:55:21.891 --> 03:55:29.517]   And so this is where you get into, you know, a lot of the dark stuff that everybody's heard about and that has come out in the last Several years, right?
[03:55:29.557 --> 03:55:32.818]  And regarding, you know, regarding international black market type stuff.
[03:55:34.259 --> 03:55:35.980]  And this also relates to elections.
[03:55:36.860 --> 03:55:41.582]  If you remember, and this is all everybody's talking about this in the last week because of the midterm elections.
[03:55:42.343 --> 03:55:46.885]  And it's sort of like you can't talk about election fraud or scammery.
[03:55:47.045 --> 03:55:51.767]  You're not supposed to talk about that, even though that is a fact of history.
[03:55:52.507 --> 03:55:53.708]  So facts of history.
[03:55:54.526 --> 03:55:56.967]  And it's even well known that the U.S.
[03:55:57.007 --> 03:56:02.768]  has employed certain people to fix elections in other countries for the last 60, 70, 80 years.
[03:56:03.488 --> 03:56:08.309]  There's people who are fixers who go for intelligence agencies and go and fix elections.
[03:56:09.550 --> 03:56:18.364]   I think Roger Stone even did a whole breakdown of who fixed elections in other countries and might have been involved in Fixing the previous presidential election.
[03:56:18.424 --> 03:56:23.788]  There was a big famous essay that Roger Stone did two or three years ago on that very thing.
[03:56:23.868 --> 03:56:28.271]  Pointing this out, this kind of should be well known, but no, you can't even mention that.
[03:56:28.871 --> 03:56:41.660]  So as the world government is put into place, as gigantic financial scam institutions collapse, you can't talk about it, and you're bad if you do, but also it's not that bad.
[03:56:42.600 --> 03:56:42.820]  Right?
[03:56:43.200 --> 03:56:46.222]  So, for years and years and years, there was no global government.
[03:56:46.242 --> 03:56:47.803]  You're bad if you mention that.
[03:56:47.823 --> 03:56:48.463]  You're crazy.
[03:56:49.023 --> 03:56:50.925]  By the way, there is a global government and it's a good thing.
[03:56:51.105 --> 03:56:54.026]  And if you don't like it, it's because you're a bigot and you're a small-minder.
[03:56:54.827 --> 03:56:56.027]  So, it's just gaslighting.
[03:56:56.267 --> 03:57:02.871]  Just like, you know, half of my videos on YouTube have the Great Reset warning from Wikipedia.
[03:57:03.151 --> 03:57:05.232]  The New World Order warning from Wikipedia.
[03:57:06.053 --> 03:57:14.386]   And it went viral on Twitter this week that as you talk about The global government summit that's going on.
[03:57:15.966 --> 03:57:23.127]  There's a warning pops up to tell you that this is disinformation and conspiracy theory.
[03:57:23.948 --> 03:57:28.228]  That there's a global government summit as it is going on.
[03:57:29.709 --> 03:57:30.189]  Amazingly.
[03:57:31.989 --> 03:57:32.729]  That is Orwell.
[03:57:32.749 --> 03:57:33.630]  That is gaslighting.
[03:57:33.690 --> 03:57:35.410]  And hopefully everybody can recognize this.
[03:57:35.450 --> 03:57:40.571]  Hopefully everybody has enough common sense and enough IQ points left.
[03:57:41.286 --> 03:57:43.708]  To figure that out, what's staring everybody in the face?
[03:57:43.808 --> 03:57:44.749]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:44.769 --> 03:57:45.289]  Don't go anywhere.
[03:57:45.329 --> 03:57:46.810]  This is Jay Dyer, Jason Alces.
[03:57:46.850 --> 03:57:50.173]  Follow me on YouTube, follow me on social media, and also support Alex in the store.
[03:57:50.453 --> 03:57:51.434]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[03:57:53.297 --> 03:57:58.500]  I wanted to give thanks for all the viewers and listeners that have kept InfoWars in the fight over the years.
[03:57:59.321 --> 03:58:04.684]  The New World Order, their globalist controllers absolutely hate our guts because they hate your guts.
[03:58:04.724 --> 03:58:05.785]  They want to break your will.
[03:58:06.085 --> 03:58:07.086]  They want to dominate you.
[03:58:07.106 --> 03:58:11.709]  They want to take full control of you and your family and your friends' destiny.
[03:58:12.549 --> 03:58:26.052]  Because of independent media outlets that tell the truth and fight for human liberty, like Infowars, that wear our bias of freedom and justice and America and God and family on our sleeve.
[03:58:27.059 --> 03:58:34.745]  We have a real fighting chance against the globalists, but that is only because of your tireless dedication and your support of InfoWars.
[03:58:34.765 --> 03:58:44.352]  So again, I'd like to thank you all for your support, and I give thanks for your dedicated prayer, word of mouth, and financial support at InfoWars4.com.
[03:58:44.391 --> 03:58:48.992]   And we make it easy to financially keep InfoWars and our media operations and our documentaries
[03:58:48.992 --> 03:58:50.551]  and our reports on air.
