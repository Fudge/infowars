[00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:02.437]  But why is it so important that we're on the air?
[00:00:02.478 --> 00:00:03.458]  Why is it so important?
[00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.961]  You're backing of the few oases of truth and freedom.
[00:00:09.182 --> 00:00:17.328]  Because as things get worse and worse, as the New World Order comes out in the open, people are hungering for the truth more than ever.
[00:00:17.428 --> 00:00:23.993]  And the globalists know if we stay on air and others stay on air, we will dominate the culture war.
[00:00:24.053 --> 00:00:24.713]  We will win.
[00:00:24.773 --> 00:00:25.814]  They will go to prison.
[00:00:26.314 --> 00:00:27.255]  They will be defeated.
[00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:57.166]  That's why it is critical, beyond critical, essential, that you continue in the face of censorship and everything that's going on by word of mouth, by text message, by email, by the side of your barn, the back of your car, calling in to talk radio, calling in to C-SPAN, going to live events, going to speak at city council events, school boards, wherever you can be heard, know whether it's by five people or a thousand or a hundred thousand or a million, you're gonna win the fight.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.604]  Go to these football games with a shirt with a message of liberty on it.
[00:01:02.984 --> 00:01:03.785]  Do a banner hang.
[00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:08.830]  Do whatever it takes legally and lawfully but with civil disobedience to culture jam these enemies.
[00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:17.978]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:20.057]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:20.057 --> 00:01:31.377]  It's Monday, September 12th. The year is 2022.
[00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:33.302]  The year is 2022.
[00:01:33.402 --> 00:01:39.525]  And we are now in direct conflict with the new world order.
[00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:40.626]  InfoWars.
[00:01:40.966 --> 00:01:42.567]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:01:42.587 --> 00:01:49.871]  The globalists are in grave danger.
[00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:52.192]  Their new world order is not going well.
[00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:56.234]  Humanity is waking up to them all over the planet.
[00:01:57.105 --> 00:02:05.088]  There are populist parties, nationalist parties, anti-World Economic Forum parties coming to power.
[00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:12.050]  The new Conservative leader in Canada is completely anti-New World Order and just won the leadership of his party.
[00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.752]  If they held elections today, Justin Trudeau would be removed as the leader of Canada.
[00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:20.293]  And the same thing is happening around the world.
[00:02:21.593 --> 00:02:27.364]   So as bad as things are, It's because the globalists are desperate and know that they are behind the eight ball.
[00:02:27.964 --> 00:02:29.165]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:02:29.185 --> 00:02:31.548]  This is going to be an extremely powerful broadcast today.
[00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:42.138]  The big interview that I taped last Thursday morning with Andrew Tate, the most Googled man in the world, is going to air in the second hour, a little bit into the third hour.
[00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:50.981]   And Rob Dew did a great job adding video clips and documents and articles To it, so it's really like a documentary.
[00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:58.423]  Extremely powerful medicine to counter the anti-human, anti-man, anti-woman, anti-child agenda.
[00:02:59.783 --> 00:03:10.306]  That is going to be premiering in the second hour today, then we'll post the full interview so you can share it at Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[00:03:11.787 --> 00:03:15.528]  That said, I never do this at the beginning of a broadcast before I get to all the news, but I'm going to do it right now.
[00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:32.495]  And this is the way God works, but I gotta tell you, when you watch the Democrat Party plaintiff's lawyers, the last show trial they had a month ago in Texas, and the new one that starts today in Connecticut, that I'll be up there next week in the hot seat, they get up and say, this man's worth $400 million.
[00:03:32.735 --> 00:03:36.156]  And we want to shut this man down, take his platform away.
[00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:43.279]  I am not worth $5 million if you sold my house, my cars, all the equipment we have.
[00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:44.319]  That is a lie.
[00:03:46.249 --> 00:03:48.811]  And it's all coming out and it's all going to come out.
[00:03:48.891 --> 00:03:55.655]  That's why we filed bankruptcy because we're right on the edge of being insolvent and to prove all these numbers in these people's faces.
[00:03:56.976 --> 00:03:58.877]  But they say that because they don't want money.
[00:03:59.938 --> 00:04:01.579]  They got all our financials in a lawsuit.
[00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:02.460]  They know the truth.
[00:04:03.961 --> 00:04:05.202]  They want to shut us down.
[00:04:06.402 --> 00:04:11.726]  So, in the last year plus, because of supply chain breakdowns, we've been sold out of a lot of the products we have.
[00:04:12.717 --> 00:04:17.141]  And in the past, when we had the products, we sold enough to be able to actually make money and even expand.
[00:04:18.082 --> 00:04:22.106]  Well, now all the products have come back in, and we desperately need people to get these amazing products.

[00:04:29.613 --> 00:04:31.094]  Still fat, but I've lost 40-plus pounds.

[00:04:47.656 --> 00:04:48.657]  That's why I like it.

[00:05:08.993 --> 00:05:11.574]  We had the three founder coins that were fundraiser coins.
[00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:16.057]  Original coins I designed, made right here in America, silver one ounce rounds.
[00:05:16.878 --> 00:05:23.222]  Now we have the next in the series, not a founding member coin, but a Americana coin.
[00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:26.904]  And this is the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin.
[00:05:27.626 --> 00:05:31.609]  It is a fundraiser to keep us on air, and we absolutely encourage everybody to get it.
[00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:32.990]  It will sell out.

[00:05:51.853 --> 00:05:53.514]  We're having more effect than we ever had.
[00:05:53.534 --> 00:05:54.894]  We're under globalist attack.
[00:05:54.934 --> 00:05:56.455]  We cannot stand without you.

[00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:50.770]  [Music]
[00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:59.770]   For more than 28 years, we have been on the front lines and the cutting edge of the battle against the New World Order.
[00:06:59.758 --> 00:07:03.160]  And we have had irrevocable effect against their operations.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.982]  That is why we are amongst the most hated people by tyrants on Earth.
[00:07:09.062 --> 00:07:14.024]  Always faithful, never giving up, never backing down, empowered by God.
[00:07:17.549 --> 00:07:20.331]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Monday Transmission.
[00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:25.614]  The big Andrew Tate interview that, believe me, is extremely powerful.
[00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:27.216]  It's what the enemy is scared of.
[00:07:27.276 --> 00:07:28.296]  Learn what they're scared of.
[00:07:28.757 --> 00:07:30.998]  This is one of his best interviews ever, if not the best.
[00:07:31.398 --> 00:07:36.782]  And again, Rob Dew and others added a bunch of B-roll and video clips and documents to the hour-long interview.
[00:07:36.822 --> 00:07:39.804]  It'll fill up the second hour and part of the third hour.
[00:07:39.824 --> 00:07:42.706]  Then we have a special guest at the end of the third hour.
[00:07:42.886 --> 00:07:48.252]   Today, you do not want to miss this Monday Worldwide Broadcast.
[00:07:49.192 --> 00:07:52.933]  Now, let me tell you what's coming up in this hour.
[00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:54.894]  I got a lot of huge news here.
[00:07:55.354 --> 00:07:56.674]  The biggest vaccine news yet.
[00:07:56.714 --> 00:07:57.855]  It's just getting crazier.
[00:07:57.915 --> 00:08:00.316]  Incredibly serious economic news.
[00:08:01.196 --> 00:08:03.597]  The whole social credit score has been announced here in the US.
[00:08:04.037 --> 00:08:04.697]  It's being rolled out.
[00:08:04.737 --> 00:08:05.377]  We'll get into that.
[00:08:06.878 --> 00:08:11.099]  More Biden staffers caught engaged in absolutely heinous activity.
[00:08:11.719 --> 00:08:14.140]  But I wanted to hit this first, not even to sell the book.
[00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:17.792]  The plans of the Death Star?
[00:08:18.652 --> 00:08:28.338]  But just to illustrate what a fraud we're dealing with, Tony Lyons of Skyworks Publishing was on with me last night, the biggest independent book publisher in the US, had a lot of courage.
[00:08:29.219 --> 00:08:37.704]  And this book, just in stores in its first week of release, sold more than 30,000 copies, hundreds of thousands in pre-sale.
[00:08:39.702 --> 00:08:40.602]  And guess what they did?
[00:08:41.162 --> 00:08:42.763]  The New York Times said, we don't care.
[00:08:42.803 --> 00:08:43.703]  They've never done this before.
[00:08:44.343 --> 00:08:46.883]  They said, we're not even listing in the New York Times bestseller list.
[00:08:47.283 --> 00:08:49.404]  Despite the fact in many lists, it was number one.
[00:08:49.424 --> 00:08:51.464]  In the Wall Street Journal list, it was number two.
[00:08:51.724 --> 00:08:53.104]  Another big list, it was number two.
[00:08:54.085 --> 00:08:57.725]  In the USA Today list, it was number 10.
[00:08:57.945 --> 00:09:01.006]  But they count all the textbooks that are sold every August.
[00:09:01.426 --> 00:09:06.107]  So there were some textbooks ahead of us, but it was the number one book in nonfiction on USA Today's list.
[00:09:07.707 --> 00:09:12.622]   Didn't even On the New York Times, and they talked to Tony Lyons.
[00:09:13.222 --> 00:09:13.963]  They know him well.
[00:09:14.963 --> 00:09:17.545]  And they said, we're not going to cover Alex Jones.
[00:09:17.886 --> 00:09:19.467]  So they tell you it's a bestseller.
[00:09:19.707 --> 00:09:24.270]  They give you a list of a Barack Obama and Joe Biden BS that can't even sell any books.
[00:09:25.071 --> 00:09:26.892]  But that's just emblematic of their fraud.
[00:09:28.113 --> 00:09:31.356]  New York Times caught rigging bestseller list against Alex Jones, The Great Reset.
[00:09:32.356 --> 00:09:33.797]  Stories up on Infowars.com.
[00:09:34.098 --> 00:09:36.239]  Number two, Wall Street Journal list.
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.321]  Number two, Publishers Weekly.
[00:09:39.153 --> 00:09:40.654]  Number ten, USA Today.
[00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:50.341]  Not on the New York Times, even though it sold nearly nine times what their best-selling books did.
[00:09:52.083 --> 00:09:54.444]  Here it is from the Wall Street Journal, actually from the Wall Street Journal.
[00:09:55.305 --> 00:09:56.466]  The Great Reset and the War of the World.
[00:09:56.686 --> 00:09:57.387]  Number two.
[00:09:59.108 --> 00:09:59.688]  In the World.
[00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:02.691]  There's another list.
[00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:11.525]   And it goes on from there, because we actually show you Information versus just telling you it's there and hoping you believe us like the mainstream media does.
[00:10:13.506 --> 00:10:17.030]  Like when they tell you Trump said he hates all Mexicans and all Mexicans are criminals.
[00:10:20.633 --> 00:10:21.093]  Never said it.
[00:10:21.113 --> 00:10:21.954]  There's no video of it.
[00:10:21.994 --> 00:10:23.355]  It's a lie, but they don't care.
[00:10:23.876 --> 00:10:25.037]  They just keep saying it.
[00:10:25.277 --> 00:10:27.519]  Like they say, Alex Jones is a white supremacist and a Nazi.
[00:10:27.739 --> 00:10:27.999]  Really?
[00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:28.560]  Where's the video?
[00:10:29.571 --> 00:10:30.171]  Where's the audio?
[00:10:30.711 --> 00:10:33.232]  You don't have it because it doesn't exist.
[00:10:33.952 --> 00:10:37.633]  You're the globalists exterminating and aborting all the babies, particularly the brown ones.
[00:10:38.073 --> 00:10:39.373]  You are the scum.
[00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:48.375]  And look, it's just desperation by these people because they want to, through Hollywood and the controlled corporate media, the dinosaur media, they want to dominate culture.
[00:10:48.775 --> 00:10:49.995]  They want to control everything.
[00:10:50.695 --> 00:10:51.516]  And it's that simple.
[00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.756]  And they don't want to show that freedom is popular.
[00:10:55.817 --> 00:11:11.832]   That's why when Anesh D'Souza's film, 2000 Mules was so big and the top documentary wasn't listed anywhere as in the top documentary charts because it's organized corporate fraud trying to suppress the people and their hunger for freedom, but it's not going to work.
[00:11:13.453 --> 00:11:15.474]  But why is it so important that we're on the air?
[00:11:15.534 --> 00:11:16.514]  Why is it so important?
[00:11:17.795 --> 00:11:20.996]  You're backing of the few LACs of truth and freedom.
[00:11:22.236 --> 00:11:40.302]   Because as things get worse and worse, As the New World Order comes out in the open, people are hungering for the truth more than ever, and the globalists know if we stay on air and others stay on air, we will dominate the culture war, we will win, they will go to prison, they will be defeated!
[00:11:41.503 --> 00:12:10.252]   That's why it is critical, beyond critical, essential, That you continue in the face of censorship and everything that's going on by word of mouth, by text message, by email, by the side of your barn, the back of your car, calling it talk radio, calling it a C-SPAN, going to live events, going to speak at city council events, school boards, wherever you can be heard, know whether it's by five people or a thousand or a hundred thousand or a million, you're gonna win the fight.
[00:12:11.913 --> 00:12:16.072]   Go to these football games with a shirt with a message of liberty on it.
[00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:22.192]   Do a banner hang, do whatever it takes legally and lawfully but with civil disobedience to culture jam these enemies
[00:12:22.192 --> 00:12:24.591]  because this is what we're really facing.
[00:12:24.591 --> 00:12:27.932]   Every week I say this is the biggest COVID news because every week it gets crazier
[00:12:27.932 --> 00:12:29.471]  two and a half years into this.
[00:12:29.471 --> 00:12:32.673]   They cooked it in a lab, they released it, gain of function, they lied to Congress.
[00:12:32.673 --> 00:12:37.832]   And now on infowars.com we have links to the New England Medical Journal
[00:12:37.832 --> 00:12:42.993]   and the Lancet British Medical Journal and just you name it, prestigious universities
[00:12:42.993 --> 00:12:47.672]   confirming that the shots don't protect you and are causing mass death.
[00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:51.273]  We could spend a whole four-hour show just on one of these studies.
[00:12:51.773 --> 00:12:52.274]  Look at this one.
[00:12:52.294 --> 00:12:56.037]  50-page study says COVID vaccines worse than the disease.
[00:12:56.738 --> 00:12:59.140]  Link to the study on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:05.252]  Gateway Pundit recap.
[00:13:05.272 --> 00:13:09.816]  16-month vaccine deaths exceed last 30 years on the VAERS reporting systems combined.
[00:13:11.298 --> 00:13:12.899]  COVID vaccine destroys natural immunity.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.182]  NEJM study finds.
[00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:17.784]  New England Journal of Medicine.
[00:13:18.185 --> 00:13:18.625]  Boom!
[00:13:19.846 --> 00:13:20.747]  Does it protect you?
[00:13:20.827 --> 00:13:23.030]  Erases your immune system and gives you vades.
[00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.192]  Vaccine autoimmune acquired.
[00:13:26.966 --> 00:13:28.287]  Autoimmune deficiency disorder.
[00:13:28.707 --> 00:13:29.807]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:30.228 --> 00:13:30.968]  More good news.
[00:13:31.028 --> 00:13:32.369]  That's bad news, but good news here.
[00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:49.858]  Judge tells White House to turn over emails from KJP, the press secretary, and Fauci to social media platforms, censoring in the last few years, in a coordinated fashion with the White House, Big Pharma, and Big Tech, scientists and doctors exposing what is now totally confirmed that these shots are deadly.
[00:13:51.218 --> 00:13:51.959]  That's what's illegal.
[00:13:52.259 --> 00:13:53.920]  Yeah, Big Tech can argue they can censor.
[00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:54.700]  It's still wrong.
[00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.021]  They should lose their Section 230 immunity.
[00:13:57.173 --> 00:14:06.316]  But when you are colluding with the government and with the industry to suppress, that's serious trade fraud.
[00:14:07.017 --> 00:14:08.437]  That's serious criminal activity.
[00:14:10.078 --> 00:14:13.319]  1,100 athletes died from sudden death from 1960-2004.
[00:14:13.339 --> 00:14:14.479]  Now 673 have died since January 2021.
[00:14:14.318 --> 00:14:18.997]  Now 673 have died since January 2021.
[00:14:18.997 --> 00:14:22.677]  See the numbers?
[00:14:22.677 --> 00:14:26.757]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:14:27.173 --> 00:14:29.714]  Western sued over vaccine mandates.
[00:14:31.594 --> 00:14:39.677]  Western University has no lawful authority to collect, copy, store, or use personal vaccination and medical information of students.
[00:14:39.717 --> 00:14:44.079]  But they did it illegally, violating HIPAA, and so much more.
[00:14:44.099 --> 00:14:50.121]  So that's just some of the news on that front today.
[00:14:52.515 --> 00:14:56.278]  Meanwhile, and I think they should get in trouble, but they shouldn't pay $36 million.
[00:14:56.619 --> 00:14:57.499]  That's these trial lawyers.
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:07.948]  Oberlin College went along with another leftist hate crime hoax of that bakery, saying they were racist at the bakery and didn't like black people.
[00:15:08.008 --> 00:15:09.830]  It was all made up by leftists in the college.
[00:15:10.130 --> 00:15:18.978]  The college went along with it and just paid $36 million for a false flag, fake racist attack, like Jesse Smollett type crap.
[00:15:20.825 --> 00:15:22.046]  And they paid $36 million.
[00:15:22.287 --> 00:15:23.848]  I mean, you see these judgments.
[00:15:23.868 --> 00:15:24.910]  Everybody's gonna go bankrupt.
[00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.754]  The whole society's gonna collapse.
[00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:29.855]  $36 million.
[00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:33.920]  How about they put the person that staged the fake attack in jail?
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.981]  How about that?
[00:15:36.763 --> 00:15:39.826]  Democrat senator compares 9-11 terrorists to January 6 rioters.
[00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:42.049]  We got more on that coming up, but let's go back to this.
[00:15:43.248 --> 00:15:49.654]  Killing people en masse, nobody gets in trouble with poison shots that erase their immune system and they knew exactly what it would do before they rolled it out.
[00:15:49.894 --> 00:15:51.195]  That's how we have the documents anew.
[00:15:52.096 --> 00:16:00.803]  We didn't just tell you two and a half years ago before it rolled out, a year before it rolled out, what would happen magically would cause blood clots, heart swelling, infertility, cancer.
[00:16:01.584 --> 00:16:03.606]  It was in the CDC internal documents that came out.
[00:16:04.508 --> 00:16:09.550]  That's why we're on air, is to continue to expose this magnitude of pure, absolute evil.
[00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:14.212]  And that's why it's beyond critical in the fight for humanity's future that you spread the word about the live feed.
[00:16:14.512 --> 00:16:18.594]  InfoWars.com forward slash show and support local MNM stations and spread the word.
[00:16:18.714 --> 00:16:20.435]  You are the Paul Revere's.
[00:16:20.655 --> 00:16:21.335]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:22.456 --> 00:16:25.157]  We are living in insanely important times.
[00:16:26.257 --> 00:16:32.080]  Thank you again so much for joining us on this Monday, September 12th, 2022 broadcast.
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.981]  The tyrants of the world know their backs against the wall.
[00:16:38.942 --> 00:16:40.223]  So they're taking the gloves off.
[00:16:40.923 --> 00:16:45.065]  They're accelerating their project of total enslavement and extermination.
[00:16:46.086 --> 00:16:50.147]  I mean, all you gotta do is turn on the news, and there's too many people, we gotta depopulate everybody.
[00:16:51.008 --> 00:16:54.369]  All over the world, Western governments say they're gonna shut down half the farms.
[00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:58.211]  In places like the Netherlands, that's the second largest food exporter in the world.
[00:16:59.752 --> 00:17:05.997]   Then they turn around like we have amnesia, as things collapse and say, oh gee, People are starving all over the world.
[00:17:06.037 --> 00:17:07.177]  There's riots everywhere.
[00:17:07.197 --> 00:17:17.021]  We better have a global government and a universal basic income that'll fix all this when the very people setting up the corporate world government are the ones behind it.
[00:17:18.802 --> 00:17:25.465]  Meanwhile, Democrat Senator compares 9-11 terrorists to January 6th rioters.
[00:17:26.225 --> 00:17:43.045]   Democrat Senator Mark Warner went on national television Yesterday, I used the 21st anniversary of 9-11 to absurdly compare the terrorists who attacked the Twin Towers and the Pentagon to insurgents who entered the Capitol on January 6th.
[00:17:43.425 --> 00:17:53.895]  Hell, Chuckie Schumer already said, if you remember, that January 6th was worse than 9-11 in Pearl Harbor.
[00:17:55.697 --> 00:17:56.398]  Unbelievable.
[00:17:58.823 --> 00:18:00.625]  Then we travel over to Switzerland.
[00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:05.008]  Swiss social media abuzz over rat out your neighbor energy posters.
[00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:13.815]  It's not just three years in prison if you turn your thermostat in the winter up above 66 degrees or in the summer above 80 degrees.
[00:18:15.357 --> 00:18:18.980]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they have posters everywhere saying rat out your neighbors.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.322]  Nazi Germany is certainly here.
[00:18:21.342 --> 00:18:21.322]  2.0.
[00:18:22.603 --> 00:18:23.844]  And that ties into this.
[00:18:25.017 --> 00:18:25.877]  This is out of the Guardian.
[00:18:26.017 --> 00:18:27.998]  Guns bought through credit cards in the U.S.
[00:18:28.038 --> 00:18:28.998]  will now be trackable.
[00:18:29.718 --> 00:18:34.139]  They don't care you go through the NICS system and the FBI and it's bought a sporting goods store or Walmart.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:34.980]  Totally legal.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:44.262]  The credit card companies have now decided outside of law that they're gonna track it and create a digital code in a file on your name.
[00:18:45.162 --> 00:18:47.143]  Keeping records of what you buy and what you do.
[00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:55.359]  You know, next it'll be alcohol for the insurance companies and next your sexual habits or what diseases you have.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.886]  Oh, we got a tracker number that you're getting medicine for HIV or you're getting medicine for heart problems.
[00:19:01.725 --> 00:19:04.525]  You're getting medicine for whatever the case is.
[00:19:04.525 --> 00:19:09.644]  And now that's valuable info that big tech can sell and use.
[00:19:09.644 --> 00:19:11.484]  But they're going to start, though, with Alex Jones.
[00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:13.164]  Oh, we're just going to censor Alex Jones.
[00:19:13.164 --> 00:19:14.164]  And then Donald Trump.
[00:19:14.164 --> 00:19:15.164]  And then, well, everybody.
[00:19:15.164 --> 00:19:19.485]   And, well, now it's a social credit score through the banks that tracks what you buy
[00:19:20.198 --> 00:19:21.519]  This is all being rolled out worldwide.
[00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:22.240]  It's here now.
[00:19:23.561 --> 00:19:25.483]  Credit card purchases of firearms in the U.S.
[00:19:25.503 --> 00:19:29.667]  can now be tracked and purchases deemed suspicious can even be shared with law enforcement.
[00:19:30.584 --> 00:19:38.772]  Oh, as if you didn't do a background check with law enforcement, according to a new measure approved by an organization that sets parameters for business transactions.
[00:19:39.533 --> 00:19:55.131]   The International Organization for Standardization, part of the UN, ISO, voted in favor of creating a merchant code for firearm stores, according to Reuters, which is then a code For everything else.
[00:19:55.571 --> 00:19:56.432]  A code for food.
[00:19:56.452 --> 00:19:58.954]  A code for oil or gas.
[00:19:59.634 --> 00:20:01.276]  Oh yeah, get ready to shut down that black market.
[00:20:01.836 --> 00:20:03.277]  This is the social credit score.
[00:20:03.757 --> 00:20:07.700]  You know, Hitler made the gays wear the pink triangle.
[00:20:08.521 --> 00:20:11.063]  And Hitler made the Jews wear the yellow star.
[00:20:11.103 --> 00:20:12.844]  And Hitler had all the, you had to wear it.
[00:20:13.465 --> 00:20:14.466]  Your papers would get checked.
[00:20:15.366 --> 00:20:17.608]  And if you got caught without it, oh, you'd go right to the gulag.
[00:20:18.028 --> 00:20:19.029]  You'd go right to the work camp.
[00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.211]  And then off to death after that.
[00:20:22.102 --> 00:20:38.069]  But now it's just digital and it's right there and it shows who you are and where you've gone and they're announcing in Australia and everywhere else these internet IDs to get online and remember they beta tested it and this year in Australia we're, oh, we're going to just call your phone randomly to make sure you're at home.
[00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:44.892]  Citizens are only allowed out one hour a day with a mask on and if you don't answer within five minutes we're coming to your house.
[00:20:45.113 --> 00:20:48.034]  You got to turn it on, they take a screenshot, yes I'm at home, I'm a good slave.
[00:20:48.925 --> 00:20:59.594]  This is all dog training and the average liberal loves it and thinks they're joining some utopian Star Trek wonder world when they're joining an absolute hell on earth.
[00:21:00.975 --> 00:21:02.857]  That ties into this MSN.com story.
[00:21:03.317 --> 00:21:06.199]  This robot catches grandma before she falls.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:11.364]  The robot follows you around, shadows you while you sleep, while you go to the bathroom.
[00:21:11.724 --> 00:21:21.398]   It's the next level of the home assistant that spies and watches you and It's a motorized wheelchair that again follows you around and calls the police if you fall down.
[00:21:21.498 --> 00:21:24.983]  Sounds good, but how about we just never have humans anymore because they die and get sicker?
[00:21:25.283 --> 00:21:27.346]  How about we just put exoskeletons on the old people?
[00:21:27.887 --> 00:21:32.834]  That's the nanny state on steroids.
[00:21:33.894 --> 00:21:38.656]  Well, we've been having blackouts here in the United States and Europe because the globals have got the power off of the power plants.
[00:21:39.176 --> 00:21:47.860]  But over in Ukraine, after they launched a major Western-backed offensive and did push back Russian forces in several areas, the Russians began bombing power plants.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:50.521]  They've been not targeting the infrastructure.
[00:21:50.961 --> 00:21:53.482]  Ukraine suffers massive blackout after Russian strikes.
[00:21:54.743 --> 00:22:01.225]  And the moral of the story is, this is escalating out of control very, very quickly.
[00:22:01.245 --> 00:22:02.826]  All right.
[00:22:03.433 --> 00:22:08.857]  I'm going to hit the fact that Biden is directly funding genocide in China.
[00:22:08.897 --> 00:22:19.223]  We pointed this out with direct taxpayer money, hundreds of billions of dollars of it in his Green Deal and all the rest of it that he didn't get officially passed, but he had added his port barrel.
[00:22:19.464 --> 00:22:23.746]  We'll be covering that at the start of the next segment.
[00:22:23.766 --> 00:22:26.829]  But I've got a very exciting announcement here.
[00:22:26.849 --> 00:22:31.555]   I got to say, I love the George Washington coin.
[00:22:31.915 --> 00:22:37.378]  I love the Tree of Liberty coin, and I love the gun coin too, but this coin is my favorite.
[00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:39.359]  You have the three founding member coins.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.262]  We're going to be launching some new stuff and new exclusive things imminently.
[00:22:44.462 --> 00:22:50.966]  Already people that bought the founding member coins got 30% off on this new coin with a promo code we sent them, so things like that.
[00:22:52.207 --> 00:22:55.929]  But well beyond it, the deal's set, things are ready, a bunch of stuff's about to go down.
[00:22:56.829 --> 00:23:11.805]   But we have the Freedom Series of coins that are now launched, that are fundraisers, that are collectible, that are historic, keep us on air, be the man and woman in the arena, support the Tip of the Spear, the new Teddy Roosevelt, citizen in a republic speech.
[00:23:13.562 --> 00:23:14.622]  Man in the arena.
[00:23:15.122 --> 00:23:16.783]  It is a gorgeous coin that I designed.
[00:23:17.323 --> 00:23:18.583]  Made right here in the United States.
[00:23:18.603 --> 00:23:20.523]  1 ounce 999 silver.
[00:23:21.103 --> 00:23:24.224]  Exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[00:23:24.784 --> 00:23:29.245]  And just like folks did a great job buying the signed books, which will all be shipped out by tomorrow.
[00:23:29.705 --> 00:23:32.085]  I bit off more than I could chew, but thank you for your support, folks.
[00:23:32.625 --> 00:23:34.706]  By Wednesday, we're going to be caught up.
[00:23:35.506 --> 00:23:38.627]  We're almost caught up as of today.
[00:23:39.267 --> 00:23:40.747]  So thank you all for getting the signed books.
[00:23:41.741 --> 00:23:48.363]  Can't do those anymore, but this is a silver coin, and it has the markup in it again to fund the operation.
[00:23:48.403 --> 00:23:49.163]  It is a collectible.
[00:23:49.223 --> 00:23:52.304]  Only 10,000 exist and will ever exist in the world.
[00:23:52.984 --> 00:23:56.025]  This is the only Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena silver coin out there.
[00:23:56.505 --> 00:23:57.825]  It's exclusively available at 1776coin.com.
[00:24:01.641 --> 00:24:03.402]  And I want to thank all you that got the past coins.
[00:24:03.422 --> 00:24:05.862]  I want to encourage those of you that haven't, we need the funds.
[00:24:05.962 --> 00:24:12.444]  Please don't make me prove to you how close we are to imploding by layoffs or shutting down or no, no, no.
[00:24:12.924 --> 00:24:14.085]  We are barely in the black.
[00:24:14.185 --> 00:24:15.865]  We're in Chapter 5 bankruptcy.
[00:24:16.105 --> 00:24:26.508]  That means if we just can be somewhat profitable and have it all overseen by a court, which we're close to having done, we will then have a plan to continue on no matter how big these rigged judgments are.
[00:24:26.728 --> 00:24:28.969]  And our crew will stay employed and I will stay on air.
[00:24:29.915 --> 00:24:31.595]  Sure, I won't get paid much, that's fine.
[00:24:32.155 --> 00:24:34.576]  I want to keep Info Wars and what we're doing going.
[00:24:34.596 --> 00:24:36.036]  I'm not going to give the enemy what they want.
[00:24:36.276 --> 00:24:39.117]  They thought they could just bankrupt things and take money away and then I would give up.
[00:24:39.337 --> 00:24:40.697]  That makes me fight that much harder.

[00:24:53.837 --> 00:24:57.837]  We'll be right back with the situation here domestically.
[00:24:57.837 --> 00:25:03.837]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:25:04.252 --> 00:25:09.015]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25:10.697 --> 00:25:14.499]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.302]  The big Andrew Taylor interview is coming up next hour, and then more.
[00:25:17.922 --> 00:25:22.626]  So let's just go back and look at who the globalists are targeting, what their priorities are.
[00:25:23.947 --> 00:25:30.362]   Senator Mark Warner compares 9-11 Terrorists that killed 3,000 people on January 6th.
[00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:31.863]  Rioters.
[00:25:33.204 --> 00:25:43.412]  Meanwhile, Biden has put forward hundreds of billions of dollars to pay and incentivize to make Americans buy electric cars, basically.
[00:25:44.913 --> 00:25:52.279]  When 80 plus percent of the electric car parts and solar panels are made in China, much of it by Uyghur slaves.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:57.323]  Lawmakers say Biden administration may be directly funding Chinese genocide.
[00:25:59.011 --> 00:26:01.213]  There's no directly funding maybe.
[00:26:01.453 --> 00:26:02.013]  They're doing it.
[00:26:02.754 --> 00:26:08.918]  Congressional Republicans want to know if the federal government is purchasing solar panels from China that were built using slave labor.
[00:26:09.138 --> 00:26:12.060]  We're not just purchasing for the federal government, they're incentivizing it for everybody.
[00:26:12.621 --> 00:26:18.265]  Lawmakers sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security's inspector general, raising the alarm about the issue, which has come increasingly into the spotlight.
[00:26:18.285 --> 00:26:20.066]  The Biden administration pushes the U.S.
[00:26:20.086 --> 00:26:23.008]  towards renewable energy sources, a market that China dominates.
[00:26:23.468 --> 00:26:31.678]   Representative Bob Gibbs, Republican Ohio, Other Republicans on the House Oversight Committee raised questions about China's notorious human rights violations and U.S.
[00:26:31.718 --> 00:26:35.599]  taxpayers would support unethical practices and enrich one of America's greatest rivals.
[00:26:37.519 --> 00:26:39.040]  It's not that we're not just vigilant.
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:50.662]  We are absolutely rolling over to this evil and then letting the left sit there and moralize like they have the moral high ground.
[00:26:52.296 --> 00:27:00.018]  Let's continue looking at the economics of what's unfolding from the two-plus years in the third world that the countries were shut down.
[00:27:01.298 --> 00:27:05.480]  Futures jump as dollar slide accelerates.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.081]  And that means prices are going to go up even more.
[00:27:10.121 --> 00:27:13.462]  That's called inflation, folks, when your dollar buys less.
[00:27:14.102 --> 00:27:14.342]  U.S.
[00:27:14.402 --> 00:27:18.423]  railroads enact contingency plans preparing for a labor strike as union talks fail.
[00:27:22.572 --> 00:27:29.392]   electricity consumption. Say learn to wear a blanket. And it goes on and on.
[00:27:29.392 --> 00:27:35.892]   Economists warn energy bill price caps could lead to blackouts in the UK. They
[00:27:35.892 --> 00:27:51.291]   snap their fingers and the whole world accelerates into a collapse. And who's
[00:27:51.291 --> 00:27:56.452]  running our government.
[00:27:56.188 --> 00:27:58.471]  Who's running the institutions?
[00:27:58.491 --> 00:28:00.693]  This has all come out in the last few months and few weeks.
[00:28:01.393 --> 00:28:02.595]  More and more of it comes out.
[00:28:03.716 --> 00:28:10.062]  That almost every new high-level initiative director is involved in just absolutely heinous stuff.
[00:28:10.963 --> 00:28:13.525]  Satanism, pedophilia support.
[00:28:14.206 --> 00:28:17.229]  It's par for the course because this is a legion of scum.
[00:28:18.391 --> 00:28:21.473]  A legion of filth that wants access to our children.
[00:28:21.533 --> 00:28:24.915]  Top Biden staffer defended gay pedophilia prostitution website.
[00:28:25.255 --> 00:28:27.297]  Rated by feds in 2015 article.
[00:28:28.637 --> 00:28:29.258]  Disgusting.
[00:28:29.318 --> 00:28:35.582]  Biden DOE hired, he runs the program, a man that defended pedophilia.
[00:28:36.923 --> 00:28:38.944]  And then you look at this guy, what the hell do you expect?
[00:28:39.364 --> 00:28:40.585]  Oh, your babysitter's here.
[00:28:40.605 --> 00:28:43.767]  Yeah, he's babysitting the nuclear material.
[00:28:45.014 --> 00:28:50.117]  I mean, oh, let's hire this person to run the nuclear program, the nuclear waste.
[00:28:50.498 --> 00:28:55.261]  Oh, let's hire this guy to run the monkeypox program into Satanism and stuff I can't even mention on air.
[00:28:57.062 --> 00:28:57.402]  Look at him.
[00:28:57.442 --> 00:28:58.142]  He's in charge.
[00:28:58.162 --> 00:28:58.903]  The devil gave him power.
[00:28:59.543 --> 00:29:01.805]  Seething with satanic power, he thinks.
[00:29:03.586 --> 00:29:08.349]  Biden's monkeypox are ruthlessly mocked online for photos following first presser.
[00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:30.554]   And the reason I covered all that is it, in recap, because it ties into Timothy Clements, that's how you say his name, sexy bisexual cannibal, stuns Venice, bones and all, gets 8.5 minute standing ovation, and reportedly, it's two men and a woman who all have sex together.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:35.723]  With each other, kidnapping and killing and eating people after they torture them to death.
[00:29:36.203 --> 00:29:37.624]  Oh, and it's so sexy and so cute.
[00:29:38.044 --> 00:29:39.385]  I told you where the left would lead you.
[00:29:39.465 --> 00:29:43.648]  Cannibalism, collapse of civilization, to the point of having to eat your neighbors.
[00:29:43.688 --> 00:29:45.609]  And I said, well, we'll have to eat the left then, won't we?
[00:29:45.809 --> 00:29:46.530]  Like eat the rich.
[00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:48.951]  A modest proposal, Jonathan Swift.
[00:29:49.572 --> 00:29:52.253]  And I said, this is satire, but it's where they're going to take you.
[00:29:52.273 --> 00:29:54.175]  Two years ago, and I was crazy.
[00:29:54.475 --> 00:29:57.897]  But now they openly admit that's exactly where we are.
[00:29:59.838 --> 00:30:00.539]  Absolutely.
[00:30:01.798 --> 00:30:02.718]  Disgusting.
[00:30:03.158 --> 00:30:03.879]  And it continues.
[00:30:03.939 --> 00:30:14.021]  Two women, followers of an Atlantic cult, charged with murder, kidnapping, and were they lured a young couple from their vehicle and shot them dead because they were white.
[00:30:15.802 --> 00:30:22.723]  And that ties into all the mass shooting of whites, the kidnapping and rape of whites, that the left is pushing everywhere.
[00:30:26.064 --> 00:30:38.163]   Meanwhile, BLM has been caught to have $90 million extra Sitting on the sideline that George Soros didn't spend manipulating our elections.
[00:30:39.004 --> 00:30:41.027]  This is who these people are.
[00:30:42.008 --> 00:30:44.250]  This is what they stand for.
[00:30:45.952 --> 00:30:50.738]  They tell you that I'm bad and Trump's bad and DeSantis is bad.
[00:30:52.412 --> 00:30:56.676]  And the truth is, I'd love to support Trump outright, but he does support the poison shots.
[00:30:56.796 --> 00:30:58.578]  Even though it's come out, they don't work and hurt people.
[00:30:58.618 --> 00:31:02.621]  But they still hate Trump because he actually hates the globalists and was fighting him.
[00:31:02.941 --> 00:31:04.423]  He just won't admit he's wrong with the shots.
[00:31:05.404 --> 00:31:11.169]  As for us, we've been against this sucker the whole time from the documents we had and knew what was happening.
[00:31:12.670 --> 00:31:13.571]  And we know what's going to happen.
[00:31:14.392 --> 00:31:22.153]  Coming up in the future, if we don't get extremely aggressive about saying this is a premeditated, great reset, New World Order takeover.
[00:31:22.433 --> 00:31:36.236]  And as I said at the beginning of the broadcast today, the good news is all over the world, they are electing anti-globalist leaders and anti-globalist leaders are becoming the heads of major political parties and major organizations.
[00:31:36.576 --> 00:31:42.177]  And in Canada, now voted in as the head of the Conservative Party, who now has the votes to unseat Trudeau.
[00:31:43.035 --> 00:31:50.921]  Is a man that harps on the New World Order and the deliberate Great Reset and the World Economic Forum being a criminal, corporate, fascist takeover system.
[00:31:52.642 --> 00:31:57.926]  So that is extremely, extremely important.
[00:31:59.127 --> 00:32:01.709]  Now, since I mentioned this, we're going to play it.
[00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:06.293]  It's Senator Mark Warner, compares 9-11 terrorists to January 6 rioters.
[00:32:07.426 --> 00:32:10.367]  Since I mentioned it, we're going to go ahead and play this clip, but I just want this to sink in.
[00:32:10.487 --> 00:32:46.489]   With all the collapsing borders, and all the exploding crime, and all the racially motivated mass shootings on both sides, and all the trouble the globalists have stirred up culturally, and the currency imploding, and the fentanyl deaths, and the record suicide, and the bankruptcies, and all of it, and the war with Russia, and the list goes on and on, the number one threat and the big terrorist, Are the million people that showed up to protest that stolen election, and the thousand or so that got waved into the Capitol by the Capitol Police, because a couple hundred broke through because the police stood down.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:53.825]  Here he is with a further declaration of war, just like Biden gave his blood red speech with the troops behind him.
[00:32:54.185 --> 00:32:57.448]  This is what they're running on with 57 days to the midterms.
[00:32:57.948 --> 00:33:00.190]  And our country came together in many ways.
[00:33:01.191 --> 00:33:06.175]  We defeated the terrorists because of the resilience of the American public, because of our intelligence community.
[00:33:06.855 --> 00:33:10.295]  And we are safer, better prepared.
[00:33:10.295 --> 00:33:15.615]   The stunning thing to me is here we are 20 years later and the attack on the symbol of
[00:33:15.615 --> 00:33:20.816]   our democracy was not coming from terrorists, but it came from literally insurgents attacking
[00:33:20.816 --> 00:33:22.775]  the Capitol on January 6th.
[00:33:22.775 --> 00:33:25.414]  So I believe we are stronger.
[00:33:25.414 --> 00:33:28.975]   I believe our intelligence community has performed remarkably.
[00:33:28.975 --> 00:33:30.375]  I think the threat of terror has been reduced.
[00:33:30.364 --> 00:33:35.884]   has diminished. I think we still have new challenges in terms of nation state
[00:33:35.884 --> 00:33:41.524]   challenges. Russia and longer term a technology competition with China. But I
[00:33:41.524 --> 00:33:46.084]   do worry about some of the activity in this country where the election deniers,
[00:33:46.084 --> 00:33:49.624]   the insurgency that took place on January 6th. That is something I hope we
[00:33:49.624 --> 00:33:55.324]   could see that same kind of unity of spirit. The insurgency like we're in
[00:33:55.324 --> 00:34:00.403]   Afghanistan. The insurgents, no an insurgency would have had guns and
[00:34:00.403 --> 00:34:03.844]  armored vehicles.
[00:34:01.952 --> 00:34:05.775]  The insurgency would have come and taken over and held the capital.
[00:34:06.195 --> 00:34:08.917]  But you don't even hold the capital to take government over.
[00:34:09.358 --> 00:34:09.958]  It's pure crap.
[00:34:11.039 --> 00:34:11.900]  You know what the globalists do?
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:19.105]  You go in, you take over the government, you take over all the bureaucracies, you put all the key people you want in the corporations, and then you bring in your fascist tyranny.
[00:34:19.125 --> 00:34:22.968]  You take control of the credit cards and start assigning code numbers to gun owners.
[00:34:23.718 --> 00:34:27.460]  Outside of law, creating your own corporate list to enforce your social credit score.
[00:34:28.181 --> 00:34:29.281]  Alright, big news straight ahead.
[00:34:29.301 --> 00:34:29.902]  Please stay with us.
[00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:36.045]  Welcome back to the final segment of this hour.
[00:34:36.105 --> 00:34:39.387]  The big Andrew Tate interview is coming up.
[00:34:39.407 --> 00:34:43.730]  I want to briefly hit on Russia, but first I want to get back to this because it's such a big deal.
[00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:50.594]  We're talking a lot about this in the next few days and weeks to come because this is what we've got to get Congress and the legislatures to move against.
[00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.442]  Guns bought through credit cards in the U.S.
[00:34:53.462 --> 00:34:54.283]  will now be trackable.
[00:34:54.683 --> 00:35:05.012]  Even though you do a background check with the federal government, they're creating a law enforcement file at the International Organization for Standardization via the United Nations.
[00:35:06.273 --> 00:35:15.961]  So the real translation here is UN creating global social credit score begins coding of products with guns and gun accessories.
[00:35:16.741 --> 00:35:23.317]   So the gun It's to be tracked by a United Nations international organization.
[00:35:25.098 --> 00:35:26.239]  And then of course we've got this.
[00:35:26.339 --> 00:35:28.421]  Ukraine suffers massive blackout after Russia strikes.
[00:35:28.801 --> 00:35:30.702]  That war is escalating very, very quickly.
[00:35:31.503 --> 00:35:34.885]  We are in direct conflict with Russia right now and we need this to end.
[00:35:34.905 --> 00:35:41.429]  We need to pray for peace and a global awakening because this is all part of the concerted globalist operation.
[00:35:41.889 --> 00:35:43.290]  And they pushed Russia into this war.
[00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:44.811]  I wish Russia wouldn't have done it.
[00:35:45.652 --> 00:35:50.287]   But now it's going on and Russia took the bait and I warned it was a setup.
[00:35:50.327 --> 00:35:51.988]  There's US troops over there fighting the Russians.
[00:35:52.468 --> 00:35:54.349]  And this is so dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:54.609 --> 00:35:55.870]  But that's why we're here on air.
[00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:57.571]  That's why it's so precious.
[00:35:58.592 --> 00:36:00.473]  What you do is spreading the word about this broadcast.
[00:36:00.813 --> 00:36:02.594]  Because we cut through the left-right paradigm.
[00:36:02.854 --> 00:36:03.955]  We cut to populism.
[00:36:03.975 --> 00:36:06.096]  We cut right to the heart of what we're facing.
[00:36:06.916 --> 00:36:10.258]  A designed, global, forced depopulation.
[00:36:10.598 --> 00:36:17.562]  Let me play a short clip from the interview that's going to premiere next hour with the most Google man in the world, Andrew Tate.
[00:36:18.663 --> 00:36:33.113]  It's been a very interesting few years and we've seen what happens when people don't have a voice and don't stand up and try and repel against these systems.
[00:36:33.594 --> 00:36:40.238]  I really do think that the acts that have happened across these last few years in the name of trying to save lives for COVID have been genuinely, genuinely criminal.
[00:36:40.618 --> 00:36:47.303]  And I don't think they would have tested this kind of system or tested this kind of censorship and repression to just stop it and go back to normal.
[00:36:47.663 --> 00:36:56.070]  I think it was a test of a system and they intend on coming in harder than ever before with some new story and some new excuse later on down the line.
[00:36:56.430 --> 00:37:01.574]  And it gets to a point where you finally have to stand up and realize that you cannot run from what is going to come to you.
[00:37:01.914 --> 00:37:02.835]  You cannot escape it.
[00:37:02.875 --> 00:37:03.756]  You cannot hide.
[00:37:04.036 --> 00:37:05.097]  You cannot deny it.
[00:37:05.377 --> 00:37:08.920]  You get to a point where you understand you need to find people who are like minded and stand up.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:16.782]  And the best way you can stand up at this current point in time is just to educate others and just to highlight the injustices which are being purported by these systems.
[00:37:17.282 --> 00:37:19.223]  My banning was absolutely and utterly unjust.
[00:37:19.443 --> 00:37:20.683]  I never broke any terms of service.
[00:37:21.103 --> 00:37:21.663]  They know that.
[00:37:21.923 --> 00:37:23.104]  The whole world knows that now.
[00:37:23.644 --> 00:37:25.564]  And the public sentiment is on my side.
[00:37:26.005 --> 00:37:35.507]  And the more people talk about this and the more people discuss this and tell others and educate others, the harder it's going to be for them to keep this curtain, this iron curtain of theirs, over the truth.
[00:37:35.947 --> 00:37:37.388]  Because that's all they truly want to do.
[00:37:38.388 --> 00:37:40.809]  Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[00:37:40.869 --> 00:37:43.049]  Everyone knows this saying and it's completely and utterly true.
[00:37:43.449 --> 00:37:45.830]  And we're now in a situation where they have absolute power.
[00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:52.952]  But I do believe that we're moving to a transitional period, a transitional place, and you've been a massive leader in that force.
[00:37:53.252 --> 00:38:00.074]  And even now, as much as they say you're banned, anybody who types your name into a lot of these Matrix-led platforms can still find videos of you.
[00:38:00.094 --> 00:38:04.255]  So they can't completely and utterly shut you up because people want to listen to what you have to say.
[00:38:04.795 --> 00:38:11.620]  People want to hear you and it's for that reason that they fear you because they try and take men like us, delete us and replace us with these talking heads.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.524]  But humans have an instinct and that instinct allows us to feel affinity with somebody.
[00:38:16.784 --> 00:38:22.428]  They can hear your voice or mine and know they want to hear what we have to say because they know we have character and we're integral and we have morals.
[00:38:22.828 --> 00:38:25.010]  These talking heads don't have any of that.
[00:38:25.170 --> 00:38:29.309]   So when they put them there to read from the hymn sheet, it simply doesn't resonate with the youth of today.
[00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:33.210]   And that's how I managed to become the most Googled man on the planet, by just telling men the truth
[00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:36.470]   about the experience they're going through and the life they're gonna live.
[00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:38.470]  It's a really interesting period of human time.
[00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:42.009]   And I've really been appreciative also of your support and the support of the other mainstream characters
[00:38:42.009 --> 00:38:44.610]   who stood up and said, "Listen, this has gone on long enough."
[00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:52.349]   On April 23rd, 1910, the iconic American president who busted up the Rockefeller Trust in America
[00:38:52.349 --> 00:38:56.509]  gave his incredibly historic speech, "Citizen in a Republic."
[00:38:56.509 --> 00:38:57.769]  (dramatic music)
[00:38:57.898 --> 00:39:01.619]  It was the man in the arena speech that sent shockwaves throughout the world.
[00:39:02.519 --> 00:39:03.899]  And I live by this creed.
[00:39:03.919 --> 00:39:13.931]   I'm about to read to you just a short excerpt of the 30 plus minute speech he gave to over 5 million Attendees in Paris, France.
[00:39:14.972 --> 00:39:20.339]  We have released a coin that has Teddy Roosevelt on the front and a gladiator on the back.
[00:39:22.025 --> 00:39:25.046]  Discusses a citizen of the Republic and the man in the arena.
[00:39:25.846 --> 00:39:31.829]  And InfoWars and everything we do is about the man and the woman in the arena fighting tyranny.
[00:39:32.529 --> 00:39:39.171]  It's the fourth coin in the series we've offered at PatriotCollectibles.com or 1776coin.com.
[00:39:39.671 --> 00:39:43.093]  There are only 10,000 of this coin available.
[00:39:43.873 --> 00:39:49.295]  Ladies and gentlemen, this coin is funding our operations as men and women in the arena.
[00:39:50.211 --> 00:39:52.654]  Let me read to you part of his famous speech.
[00:39:53.234 --> 00:40:00.001]  It's not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man has stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[00:40:00.421 --> 00:40:13.434]   The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again, Because there is no effort without error and shortcoming.
[00:40:13.714 --> 00:40:34.492]  But who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be amongst the cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[00:40:35.183 --> 00:40:37.266]  This is the man in the arena coin.
[00:40:37.627 --> 00:40:38.948]  Only $10,000 in the world.
[00:40:39.129 --> 00:40:46.129]   Get yours now at 1776coin.com and take the info to the next level.
[00:40:46.129 --> 00:40:56.129]   Everyone says that today the royal family is nothing more than a ceremonial figure,
[00:40:56.129 --> 00:41:03.129]   even though they choose the government, have final approval over all legislation, and own half the country.
[00:41:03.804 --> 00:41:12.672]  And so while we remember Queen Elizabeth, let us not forget how this incestuous family has used their own children to gain power.
[00:41:13.593 --> 00:41:30.608]  Parliamentary lawfare over trading rights between England and Scotland led to the first iteration of the United Kingdom in 1707 and created the legal groundwork for George of Hanover to be crowned King of England in Ireland in 1714.
[00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:40.576]  He was 55 years old, married to his first cousin, and didn't speak any English because he was from the German house of Hanover.
[00:41:41.502 --> 00:41:49.990]  The English people were not happy about this, and his coronation was met with riots all across the country, followed by years of rebellions.
[00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:55.395]  His grandson, King George III, inspired the American Revolution.
[00:41:55.835 --> 00:42:04.623]  And when his granddaughter Victoria married her first cousin, Prince Albert, the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha took sway over the country.
[00:42:05.464 --> 00:42:18.213]  Throughout the First World War, the people of England were questioning the loyalty of the German bloodlines who ruled over them, which prompted the royal family to change their name to Windsor in 1917.
[00:42:19.594 --> 00:42:25.218]  Nine years later, Queen Elizabeth was born, who was initiated into the Druid Order in 1946.
[00:42:27.319 --> 00:42:34.705]  married Prince Philip of Nazi bloodlines in 1947 and gave birth to Charles in 1948.
[00:42:35.145 --> 00:42:55.821]  In 2010, William Coombs, survivor of Canada's infamous residential schools where the mass graves of children were found, claimed to have witnessed Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip visit the Kamloops Residential School in 1964, where they took 10 of the children away with them.
[00:42:56.241 --> 00:42:57.201]  Never to return.
[00:42:57.762 --> 00:43:00.783]  A year later, William Coombs dies in the hospital.
[00:43:02.123 --> 00:43:10.967]  In 1988, Prince Philip told the German press that he hopes to be reincarnated as a deadly virus to help with the population problem.
[00:43:11.727 --> 00:43:17.430]  And his son, King Charles, likes to joke on television how he is related to Dracula.
[00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:23.172]  His Royal Highness Prince Charles, who can trace his ancestry back to Romania's dark and distant past.
[00:43:24.042 --> 00:43:27.775]  The genealogy shows that I'm descended from Vlad the Impaler, you see.
[00:43:28.497 --> 00:43:30.062]  So I do have a bit of a stake in the country.
[00:43:30.484 --> 00:43:30.945]  As it were.
[00:43:32.972 --> 00:43:41.399]  These royals are the result of an incestuous breeding program wherein children were used as a way to gain power over the masses.
[00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:59.714]  So it's no surprise that they are caught up with the likes of Jeffrey Epstein, who made a living using children to leverage power, and Jimmy Savile, who had unfettered access to rape hundreds of children inside NHS hospitals, and was a dear friend of King Charles.
[00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:04.820]  Along with Klaus Schwab, King Charles is a founder of the Great Reset.
[00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:07.282]  He's as green as Greta Thunberg.
[00:44:07.703 --> 00:44:14.731]  And last year, he announced the need for a military-style campaign to bring the world to zero emissions.
[00:44:14.971 --> 00:44:20.677]  Here we need a vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector.
[00:44:21.778 --> 00:44:38.929]  With trillions at his disposal, far beyond global GDP, and with the greatest respect, beyond even the governments of the world's leaders, it offers the only real prospect of achieving fundamental economic transition.
[00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:41.631]  So, how do we do it?
[00:44:42.291 --> 00:44:43.332]  We know how they'll do it.
[00:44:43.872 --> 00:44:48.335]  By cutting off Europe's fuel and forcing the people back into the 1700s.
[00:44:50.432 --> 00:44:53.072]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:44:53.072 --> 00:45:14.072]  Thanks for watching.
[00:45:14.615 --> 00:45:18.018]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence in the world.
[00:45:18.438 --> 00:45:20.039]  It will never be made again.
[00:45:20.059 --> 00:45:22.661]  It's not just an amazing historic coin.
[00:45:23.081 --> 00:45:26.324]  It funds the information war against the globalists.
[00:45:26.664 --> 00:45:28.845]  This is something you want to hand down to your grandchildren.
[00:45:29.206 --> 00:45:30.427]  This is something you want to own.
[00:45:30.927 --> 00:45:36.151]  And as a fundraiser, it is funding the information war against the globalists.
[00:45:36.711 --> 00:45:39.053]  Ladies and gentlemen, 10,000 coins are available.
[00:45:39.093 --> 00:45:40.114]  They'll sell out very quickly.
[00:45:40.794 --> 00:45:43.496]  Please be part of history and thank you all for your support.
[00:45:44.316 --> 00:45:50.641]  You can go to 1776coin.com or you can go to patriotcollectibles.com and secure this coin.
[00:45:50.941 --> 00:45:55.304]  There's only 10,000 of this coin in existence and it funds the Infowar.
[00:45:56.024 --> 00:45:58.546]  Man in the arena coin, Teddy Roosevelt.
[00:45:59.006 --> 00:45:59.587]  1776coin.com.
[00:45:59.867 --> 00:46:10.454]  Well, I'm known as the most controversial man in America, probably the world, except now somebody's giving me a really good run for my money.
[00:46:11.149 --> 00:46:12.150]  And he's a good friend of mine.
[00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:13.350]  He's a good friend of Paul Watson.
[00:46:14.071 --> 00:46:14.451]  We've hung out.
[00:46:14.491 --> 00:46:15.511]  He's been on the show many times.
[00:46:15.551 --> 00:46:16.312]  He's hosted the show.
[00:46:16.352 --> 00:46:22.415]  He's Andrew Tate, the most searched individual in the last six months on the Internet every single day.
[00:46:22.976 --> 00:46:33.081]  And he is just on fire with the young people with a really good, strong, pro-human message that completely threatens the power structure because they want us to be weak.
[00:46:33.161 --> 00:46:34.162]  They want us to be victims.
[00:46:34.702 --> 00:46:36.003]  And Andrew Tate is the opposite.
[00:46:36.023 --> 00:46:41.626]   But what really freaks people out is that their daughters Are listening to Andrew Tate.
[00:46:42.246 --> 00:46:47.107]  I was having dinner a few days ago with another good friend of mine that's a well-known podcaster and he brought up Andrew Tate.
[00:46:47.127 --> 00:46:48.547]  He said, yeah, it's really crazy.
[00:46:49.188 --> 00:46:50.688]  My daughters are big fans.
[00:46:50.788 --> 00:46:52.388]  Those are high school daughters.
[00:46:52.428 --> 00:47:03.270]  So Andrew Tate has absolutely massively and had a gigantic effect and the power structure is insanely scared of him.
[00:47:03.590 --> 00:47:07.691]  Now if he was a bad guy and had this much influence and they didn't control him, they'd be coming after him.
[00:47:07.991 --> 00:47:09.191]  But he's a good guy.
[00:47:09.969 --> 00:47:13.148]  With incredible pull and that scares them.
[00:47:14.505 --> 00:47:20.770]  To their very core, and that's why this hour-long interview, uncensored, is so critical.
[00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:27.395]  Andrew Tate being able to speak for himself, because now he's become one of the most banned men in the world.
[00:47:27.415 --> 00:47:29.056]  There's only a few other people out there.
[00:47:29.116 --> 00:47:30.177]  Donald Trump is one of them.
[00:47:30.497 --> 00:47:34.280]  I'd say in the top three most banned people in the world, it's Andrew Tate, Alex Jones, and Donald Trump.
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:36.702]  That's why this interview is so incredibly important.
[00:47:37.002 --> 00:47:40.765]  We're in a club, it's a pretty elite club, and it's because we scare the establishment.
[00:47:41.066 --> 00:47:42.687]  Andrew Tate, great to have you here, my friend.
[00:47:43.991 --> 00:47:50.180]  Absolutely glad to be here, and that's a pretty good club to be part of, so I'm almost happy for the membership.
[00:47:51.802 --> 00:47:52.523]  Where to start?
[00:47:53.084 --> 00:47:57.450]  The band, what you're going through, what's unfolding, what's coming next?
[00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:58.512]  We're gonna get into so much here today.
[00:47:59.881 --> 00:48:01.903]  Yeah, it was, uh, The Matrix attacked me.
[00:48:02.003 --> 00:48:02.964]  I knew they always would.
[00:48:03.484 --> 00:48:06.486]  They attacked in a very clever manner.
[00:48:06.987 --> 00:48:11.851]  I received a strike on YouTube, which prevents you from posting for seven days.
[00:48:12.731 --> 00:48:17.055]  After I received the strike, Meta banned me, which is Instagram and Facebook.
[00:48:17.095 --> 00:48:17.776]  They banned me.
[00:48:18.296 --> 00:48:25.502]  I filmed a YouTube video to reply to the ban, while I still had my YouTube account, because they're pretending they're fair and that it all doesn't happen in sync.
[00:48:25.962 --> 00:48:28.624]  They allowed my YouTube account to survive for four more days.
[00:48:29.705 --> 00:48:31.567]  And then they banned my YouTube account.
[00:48:32.027 --> 00:48:38.493]  So the strike was given to me on purpose to make sure that I couldn't post my reply video directly after the first ban.
[00:48:38.853 --> 00:48:44.378]  And for them to pretend that there was some kind of degree of separation between the large matrix attacks.
[00:48:44.958 --> 00:48:51.204]  I've been banned on basically every single platform from Airbnb to Uber through to social media platforms, payment processors, absolutely everything.
[00:48:51.804 --> 00:48:52.765]  And you're completely right.
[00:48:53.206 --> 00:48:54.046]  I teach people.
[00:48:54.927 --> 00:49:01.949]  And inspire people to think for themselves and that makes you the enemy of the establishment because you are not allowed to think, you're only allowed to comply.
[00:49:03.369 --> 00:49:11.951]  Let's walk through that because before we started this interview today, you said the most important point is once they silence you, then they can tell whatever lies about you.
[00:49:11.971 --> 00:49:15.392]  You're not just put in the Phantom Zone, now they can misrepresent who you are.
[00:49:16.937 --> 00:49:18.758]  Absolutely, and that's the number one intention, right?
[00:49:18.798 --> 00:49:28.403]  Because when these large companies decide to ban somebody, they also monitor in real time public perception, social media comments and posts, and how people feel about their decision.
[00:49:28.843 --> 00:49:43.210]  So to make sure they don't look tyrannical, after they ban you, they use the media machine to lie about you and paint a narrative that you're the worst person in the world, to try and convince the populace that your ban was actually a good thing, so they can get away with their actions unscathed.
[00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:45.651]  The lies are a very, very important part of their plan.
[00:49:45.671 --> 00:49:53.295]  They're always pre-orchestrated, and they come in hard and fast and heavy across every single mainstream media outlet in real time.
[00:49:53.635 --> 00:49:56.357]  As soon as you've been banned, you can no longer defend yourself.
[00:49:56.577 --> 00:49:57.377]  You are defenseless.
[00:49:58.418 --> 00:50:01.679]  And what you just said is so incredibly critical, and that's why they're scared of you.
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:15.761]   When they began their purge of Infowars in August of 2018, Tim Cook later bragged that he met that Sunday night with the heads of the big six tech companies.
[00:50:16.061 --> 00:50:17.522]  That's how important the censorship is.
[00:50:17.742 --> 00:50:22.386]  We think that what the user wants is someone that does review these apps.
[00:50:22.946 --> 00:50:26.309]  Someone that does review the podcasts.
[00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:32.374]  Someone that, on like Apple News, where a human is selecting the top story.
[00:50:32.967 --> 00:50:36.188]  But at what point were you like, okay, that's it, Alex Jones has to go?
[00:50:36.408 --> 00:50:50.072]  You know, I don't want to get into a singular kind of event, but I think there's enough there that reasonable people could agree that if you're going to curate, that that should be off.
[00:50:50.152 --> 00:50:55.613]  And it wasn't just about Alex Jones, it was about setting this precedent and how they first decided to have YouTube shut me down.
[00:50:55.933 --> 00:50:57.574]  First was the strike, so we couldn't respond.
[00:50:57.594 --> 00:50:58.854]  It's all very strategic.
[00:50:58.974 --> 00:50:59.935]  This is admitted, by the way.
[00:51:00.535 --> 00:51:01.195]  Cook's given interviews.
[00:51:02.125 --> 00:51:03.086]  A device, you name it.
[00:51:03.067 --> 00:51:05.706]  In terms of power, I've never felt like I had any power.
[00:51:05.706 --> 00:51:07.146]  [Music]
[00:51:07.146 --> 00:51:11.947]  [Glass shattering]
[00:51:11.947 --> 00:51:20.106]   Then Facebook, Instagram, all of the major sites, over 60 of them, even LinkedIn,
[00:51:20.106 --> 00:51:23.626]  then banned me two days after the YouTube strike.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.922]  And it was all very, very strategic.
[00:51:27.542 --> 00:51:28.943]  And this is a battle plan.
[00:51:28.963 --> 00:51:33.406]  And they now admit it's a battle plan, which they later used on Donald Trump as well.
[00:51:33.626 --> 00:51:37.448]  And now they're using it against millions of not just Americans, but people all over the world.
[00:51:37.488 --> 00:51:48.552]   And we see the videos in Europe and the UK Where the man criticizes transgenderism and puts up a transgender flag with a swastika on it and they come and arrest the veteran at his home.
[00:51:48.652 --> 00:51:54.594]  So whatever you see being done to Andrew Tate and Alex Jones and Donald Trump today will end up being done to you.
[00:51:54.634 --> 00:52:01.096]  This is a blueprint where they pick out the alpha males that they see on the vanguard because they're really coming after everybody else.
[00:52:01.866 --> 00:52:02.346]  Absolutely.
[00:52:02.366 --> 00:52:03.407]  That's the first thing they want to do.
[00:52:03.447 --> 00:52:03.747]  You're right.
[00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:08.568]  They destroy the people who can inspire resistance amongst the populace and they need to control the narrative.
[00:52:08.688 --> 00:52:15.751]  These people who I call, I often use the popular movie as an easy way to characterize and explain my mindset.
[00:52:15.811 --> 00:52:24.134]  I call them the Matrix and they are the Matrix because they purport a false version of reality for people to subscribe to so they can be drained of their resource and use.
[00:52:24.594 --> 00:52:26.755]  And they literally paint a false reality.
[00:52:26.815 --> 00:52:32.897]  And the reason they're able to do that is because everyone who counters that reality, they attempt to delete in real time.
[00:52:33.297 --> 00:52:34.358]  They just did it with COVID.
[00:52:34.378 --> 00:52:38.580]  They convinced people that something was happening that literally wasn't even happening in real time.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:47.343]  And the reason they didn't manage to get away with it for so long is because every time you spoke up and told the truth and talked about what you see with your own eyes and hear with your own ears, you're silenced.
[00:52:47.683 --> 00:52:50.864]  They need to control the world and control how people think.
[00:52:51.264 --> 00:52:52.305]  And we are a threat to that.
[00:52:53.393 --> 00:52:54.754]  And that's how the gaslighting works.
[00:52:55.234 --> 00:52:58.435]  Let's expand on that for people that don't know what it's like to be unpersoned.
[00:52:58.956 --> 00:53:04.458]  This is a forte or this is a first look at what's going to happen under the global social credit score they've set up.
[00:53:04.978 --> 00:53:07.640]  They came after your banking, your credit cards, your processing.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:16.084]  Describe for people, not as a victim as you've said, but as a warrior at the front of the fight, how the enemy is going to attack so people behind us in the fight know what's coming.
[00:53:16.764 --> 00:53:18.785]  Yeah, first thing they want to do is they want to hurt your money.
[00:53:18.985 --> 00:53:21.906]  So they destroy your processing, your banking, anything that involves money.
[00:53:21.926 --> 00:53:25.608]  You're going to start being put under review or deleted and disabled in real time.
[00:53:26.248 --> 00:53:28.909]  Shortly after, you're right, the social media platforms ban you.
[00:53:29.009 --> 00:53:29.970]  First one bans you.
[00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:35.292]  The other ones usually wait a day or two, but they put in a strike so you cannot reply and use the platform.
[00:53:35.352 --> 00:53:39.194]  They put in a day or two gap to try and pretend that they're not all doing it in succinct.
[00:53:39.654 --> 00:53:44.899]  And after that, it comes in hard and fast from Airbnb to Uber to Discord to Gmail accounts to absolutely anything and everything.
[00:53:44.939 --> 00:53:48.262]  They just start annihilating in real time, wiping them off the face of the planet.
[00:53:48.502 --> 00:53:49.503]  And you have no recourse.
[00:53:49.843 --> 00:53:59.012]  While they are doing this, they ensure that their media machine is telling the biggest lies and gaslighting the public into believing you are genuinely dangerous and deserve what's happening to you.
[00:53:59.412 --> 00:54:00.312]  This is a big part of it.
[00:54:00.352 --> 00:54:03.873]  They need the populace to believe that you deserve this treatment.
[00:54:04.233 --> 00:54:16.217]  So they elaborate, they exaggerate, they choose small portions of things you said, they take things out of context, and they attack you absolutely so that people at home sit and go, wow, this bad person should be deleted for my safety.
[00:54:16.477 --> 00:54:25.661]  The amount of people I see who are like, free speech, let's not ban Tate, or a lot of the stuff I say is, I don't like Tate, but, you know, I believe in not censoring people in free speech.
[00:54:25.921 --> 00:54:26.701]  It's all men.
[00:54:26.781 --> 00:54:29.902]  He is saying vile stuff that I'm a woman.
[00:54:30.182 --> 00:54:30.723]  You're not.
[00:54:30.983 --> 00:54:31.963]  It doesn't affect you.
[00:54:32.343 --> 00:54:50.910]   There is a whole other problem about unilaterally Banning somebody the way these platforms work together to ban somebody overnight Completely remove them the way that I see it Andrew Tate because I'm I'm very aware of you might know more Yeah, cuz I don't maybe right maybe possibly.
[00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:52.511]  Yeah, I see him as a hate group.
[00:54:52.551 --> 00:55:01.864]   He's saying stuff like that women are the property of their boyfriend or husband, whatever it is.
[00:55:01.864 --> 00:55:04.824]  Ultimately, what he advocates is for violence against women.
[00:55:04.824 --> 00:55:09.663]   Yes. If you take into context also that he's done sex trafficking, does it
[00:55:09.663 --> 00:55:16.063]   change your well, listen, 100% if he's doing sex trafficking, will be in that
[00:55:16.063 --> 00:55:19.783]   is they convince the people of the world that is only the only way they can be
[00:55:19.783 --> 00:55:23.164]   safe is if people like us don't exist when nothing could be further from the
[00:55:23.164 --> 00:55:28.583]   truth. And what you said again is beyond critical. The globalists even brag
[00:55:29.439 --> 00:55:34.746]  They have the head of YouTube get up and say, yeah, my son likes Alex Jones, so I worked with other big tech to ban him.
[00:55:35.287 --> 00:55:36.468]  I decided you don't get to see him.
[00:55:36.568 --> 00:55:41.074]  And Tim Cook said, we curated, like a museum, you know, Alex Jones, put him in the Phantom Zone.
[00:55:42.195 --> 00:55:44.338]  It's all coordinated, and that's what makes it illegal.
[00:55:44.779 --> 00:55:49.444]   Yeah, they can argue that We're utilities, but we're still allowed to ban people.
[00:55:49.464 --> 00:55:50.304]  We're private companies.
[00:55:50.864 --> 00:56:03.428]  But once they coordinate with the federal government and with Interpol and with European nations and the Communist Chinese and others, now it's government colluding to censor people, and that is illegal in every Western nation.
[00:56:03.468 --> 00:56:11.170]   That's why lawsuits have been filed against Twitter, Facebook, and others, because even Zuckerberg went on Joe Rogan two weeks ago and admitted He said, yeah.
[00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:13.731]  The FBI said, don't put out the Hunter Biden story.
[00:56:14.152 --> 00:56:15.812]  It's disinfo, which we all knew it was true.
[00:56:16.072 --> 00:56:16.693]  It was true then.
[00:56:16.953 --> 00:56:22.175]  And so they censored billions of users from being able to see that info because the FBI said so.
[00:56:22.415 --> 00:56:27.817]  That's the government in direct, the deep state, in direct collusion with big tech.
[00:56:28.297 --> 00:56:31.899]  If that isn't authoritarianism, if that isn't tyranny, nothing is.
[00:56:33.285 --> 00:56:34.346]  Well, that's how tyranny works.
[00:56:34.406 --> 00:56:38.127]  One of the key components of tyranny is you have to remove all opposing sides of an argument.
[00:56:38.487 --> 00:56:40.608]  And that's basically the easiest way to tyranny.
[00:56:40.628 --> 00:56:41.749]  This is what people don't understand.
[00:56:42.249 --> 00:56:56.376]  If you have two sides of an argument, regardless, even the people who disagree with me, I think they should have a platform and should be allowed to speak so that we can find a way to make sure that all of our discourse and all of our narratives are tested and battleground tested and we have a chance to explain ourselves.
[00:56:56.716 --> 00:57:03.120]  When you remove the other side and live in an echo chamber, nobody needs to have any kind of logical explanation or logical grounding for their thoughts.
[00:57:03.441 --> 00:57:06.503]  And that's how it's very, very easy and quick to grind into complete and utter tyranny.
[00:57:06.843 --> 00:57:08.224]  Look what happened in the last three years.
[00:57:08.284 --> 00:57:11.606]  Nobody was allowed to stand up and say these lockdown measures are draconian.
[00:57:11.886 --> 00:57:17.670]  These lockdown measures are out of control and they're genuinely damaging people more than the virus itself because nobody was allowed to say that.
[00:57:17.690 --> 00:57:18.731]  Look what we spiraled into.
[00:57:18.751 --> 00:57:26.596]  We spiraled into a situation where, like you said, the government broke their own law, broke the own laws of the Constitution to protect us against basically everything.
[00:57:26.436 --> 00:57:29.956]   and destroy people's lives in real time. I don't believe that the lockdown
[00:57:29.956 --> 00:57:32.756]   measures have been legal in a single country they were in implemented. How
[00:57:32.756 --> 00:57:38.756]   could they be? Well that's right and they say their science but everything they
[00:57:39.541 --> 00:57:41.041]  I use a Hunter Biden laptop.
[00:57:41.261 --> 00:57:53.785]  The COVID censorship of ivermectin that they knew worked and they confirmed in major studies works, the censorship of other treatments, the ventilators, the not letting family in to see their parents in nursing homes, but sending sick people in.
[00:57:54.405 --> 00:57:58.226]  Everything they did, claiming that the vaccine's 100% effective, now they admit it doesn't work.
[00:57:58.246 --> 00:58:02.507]  9 out of 10 dying have been triple jabbed.
[00:58:03.127 --> 00:58:09.813]  I mean, they really have proven that they're in a war against science, and science is questioning, science is challenging.
[00:58:10.234 --> 00:58:11.135]  That's what freedom is.
[00:58:11.255 --> 00:58:12.276]  Real science is freedom.
[00:58:12.296 --> 00:58:22.125]  And as you said, they need a echo chamber where they can just brainwash people, or a matrix, a false reality bubble they put people in.
[00:58:22.425 --> 00:58:26.629]  We were talking before we went on air today, you want to talk about the Great Awakening, you were telling me they're losing.
[00:58:27.697 --> 00:58:34.762]  Yeah, I think that there's massive pressure behind the dam that people are starting to wake up and understand that these people are tyrannical.
[00:58:35.302 --> 00:58:47.130]  And the only thing that's missing, the only crack that has been missing for a long time is the fact that once you've been depersoned, a lot of people are genuinely fearful of it because they don't feel like they can maintain mainstream consciousness.
[00:58:47.490 --> 00:58:48.571]  You've done very, very well.
[00:58:49.131 --> 00:58:50.812]  I'm now going to do very, very well myself.
[00:58:51.153 --> 00:58:57.157]  And as we continue to lead the world to show that even without these platforms, you can stay relevant, respected and still reach your audience.
[00:58:57.757 --> 00:59:02.960]  Then that's going to put the crack in the dam, and I believe the pressure is going to do the rest, and it's going to finally explode and blow open.
[00:59:03.301 --> 00:59:08.804]  People are tired of being told what they're allowed to hear and what they're allowed to think on all sides of the spectrum.
[00:59:08.944 --> 00:59:13.167]  I like to believe that people are tired of this, and it doesn't matter what kind of monopoly you hold.
[00:59:13.227 --> 00:59:18.310]  Every single monopoly in history believed they had ultimate power and would never, ever, ever lose control.
[00:59:18.630 --> 00:59:19.591]  The Roman Empire did.
[00:59:19.871 --> 00:59:20.891]  The Mongol Empire did.
[00:59:21.172 --> 00:59:22.232]  This tech empire does.
[00:59:22.492 --> 00:59:26.415]  And sooner or later, when you're too tyrannical and you piss off populations, there is revolution.
[00:59:26.943 --> 00:59:29.084]  The world up until this point was based on freedom.
[00:59:29.384 --> 00:59:34.105]  How they advertised you to be a good slave was they would give you some freedom.
[00:59:34.345 --> 00:59:41.748]  And when I say slave, I use that word particularly because a slave used to work his ass off and he would get food and a house in return.
[00:59:42.208 --> 00:59:44.950]  99% of people out here, my friend, are working their asses off.
[00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:46.331]  They can buy food in the house.
[00:59:46.731 --> 00:59:47.212]  That's it.
[00:59:47.472 --> 00:59:48.613]  Most people are still slaves.
[00:59:48.753 --> 00:59:51.195]  They would tell you, you're going to be a slave, but you'll be free at least.
[00:59:51.435 --> 00:59:53.136]  You know, you can do what you want.
[00:59:53.176 --> 00:59:54.157]  You can think what you want.
[00:59:54.297 --> 00:59:55.238]  You can say what you want.
[00:59:55.278 --> 00:59:57.359]  You can walk around outside, look at the trees.
[00:59:57.399 --> 00:59:58.720]  You're a slave, but you're free.
[00:59:58.820 --> 00:59:59.941]  Freedom, freedom, freedom.
[01:00:00.341 --> 01:00:01.762]  And what happened when they did this?
[01:00:02.123 --> 01:00:02.863]  Something changed.
[01:00:03.204 --> 01:00:03.784]  The internet came.
[01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:05.025]  People started to talk.
[01:00:05.105 --> 01:00:05.926]  People started to think.
[01:00:06.146 --> 01:00:07.807]  People started to realize how money is made.
[01:00:08.007 --> 01:00:09.568]  People start to realize it's all a scam.
[01:00:09.849 --> 01:00:11.190]  Cryptocurrency was invented.
[01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:14.332]  Now you have Bitcoin, which is surpassing the global reserve currency.
[01:00:14.352 --> 01:00:15.413]  We don't need banks anymore.
[01:00:15.593 --> 01:00:16.754]  We don't need the IMF anymore.
[01:00:16.934 --> 01:00:17.795]  People are starting to talk.
[01:00:18.015 --> 01:00:21.318]  People have elected Trump, a man who's not bought and controlled by the establishment.
[01:00:21.598 --> 01:00:23.679]  People are starting to actually get their minds right.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:26.942]  So the people in charge are like, oh, we're losing control.
[01:00:26.962 --> 01:00:28.363]  We no longer control the money.
[01:00:28.603 --> 01:00:30.645]  We no longer control who's in charge of each country.
[01:00:30.945 --> 01:00:32.306]  Oh, we've got to put an end to this.
[01:00:32.506 --> 01:00:34.628]  We can no longer base our societies on freedom.
[01:00:34.888 --> 01:00:37.090]  We must base our societies on safety.
[01:00:38.123 --> 01:00:44.509]  You can't think for yourself, we can't put these videos on YouTube because it's fake news and it's dangerous.
[01:00:44.669 --> 01:00:48.813]  You can't go outside because of the virus and it's dangerous.
[01:00:49.113 --> 01:00:52.856]  You can't travel in between countries without that injection because it's dangerous.
[01:00:52.876 --> 01:00:56.720]  This is no longer about freedom my friends, this is about your safety.
[01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:00.681]   They're going to take all your freedom away and instead they're gonna give you a nice big
[01:01:00.681 --> 01:01:04.760]   helping of safety and you're gonna take it and go all at least I'm safe you were
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:09.021]   safer before you were safer before because now the government can arrest you for
[01:01:09.021 --> 01:01:12.161]   saying something you don't like now you're spreading fake news you were safer
[01:01:12.161 --> 01:01:17.240]   when you could have an opinion well that's right I'm not a world champion kickboxer
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.771]   like you but I certainly learned growing up in Dallas where it was rough
[01:01:20.771 --> 01:01:24.541]   and tumble that a lot of people start a fight with you and then hit you and then
[01:01:24.541 --> 01:01:27.720]   they would stand back and wait for you to fall over but if you didn't fall
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.291]   over well then you were on top of them and they were losing and what the
[01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:35.010]   globalist do is they attack us they demonize us and they expect us to buy into the
[01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:38.881]   narrative that oh it's over for us but if you just keep fighting the human
[01:01:38.881 --> 01:01:44.591]   instinct sees that and has a real desire a fiery lust to be part of that and
[01:01:44.591 --> 01:01:50.120]   so by us not giving up even if we're destroyed like the Alamo
[01:01:49.614 --> 01:01:55.180]  We inspire others for the overall victory of our species, and I think that's where we're going to win in the end.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:02:01.708]  The globalists think we're like them, where if they were attacked, or they were bullied, or they were demonized, they would go away because they're followers.
[01:02:01.748 --> 01:02:04.150]  They joined the globalists, this hierarchical system.
[01:02:04.391 --> 01:02:08.155]  They don't understand that we don't give up when we're attacked, we just attack harder.
[01:02:09.396 --> 01:02:10.798]  How would you quantify that phenomenon?
[01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:13.311]  No, you're completely and utterly right.
[01:02:13.371 --> 01:02:17.094]  We are men of old and leaders of old used to charge first into battle.
[01:02:17.134 --> 01:02:22.098]  We don't send other people's sons and kids to go die in war and hide in a nice cushy office ourselves.
[01:02:22.198 --> 01:02:22.398]  No.
[01:02:22.738 --> 01:02:26.181]  Men of old, we go on a horse and we charge in front of our armies.
[01:02:26.582 --> 01:02:28.183]  And we're a different caliber of man.
[01:02:28.563 --> 01:02:30.745]  And that's why we have independent thoughts in the first place.
[01:02:30.765 --> 01:02:31.065]  You're right.
[01:02:31.105 --> 01:02:32.126]  We never subscribed.
[01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:33.307]  We never sold our souls.
[01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:41.993]  We developed independent thoughts that allowed us to think for ourselves and come to our own conclusions despite the fact that there are large groups of people that told us we are completely and utterly wrong.
[01:02:42.393 --> 01:02:51.399]  And we have the kind of personality and persuasion and also charisma to convince others and inspire others to charge at the enemy.
[01:02:51.419 --> 01:02:52.820]  And that's exactly what they're scared of.
[01:02:53.919 --> 01:02:59.323]  Well, I'm going to go ahead and tell a story here, and I'm not going to name names because I don't want to embarrass anybody, but I had problems when I was a teenager, too.
[01:02:59.363 --> 01:02:59.964]  I'm not perfect.
[01:03:00.524 --> 01:03:03.787]  But I have somebody very close to me that got into being a victim.
[01:03:03.807 --> 01:03:13.714]  They were still great, but felt sorry for themselves and just was caught up in the system and had girlfriends that were liberal and just that whole sick society.
[01:03:14.315 --> 01:03:16.076]  And I couldn't wake them up with my pep talks.
[01:03:16.837 --> 01:03:23.002]  I couldn't get them to make the leap into being a real man when they had such incredible potential.
[01:03:23.681 --> 01:03:37.624]  And literally listening to you for the last eight months or so, because I'm really busy, stuff's going on, I watch your clips, I love you, but I wasn't really paying attention, and someone very close to me said, Andrew Tate, he's amazing, he's waking me up, he's doing all this, you know, he's number one, he's incredible.
[01:03:37.864 --> 01:03:39.064]  I'm like, yeah, I know Andrew, he's wonderful.
[01:03:39.624 --> 01:03:47.086]  And then I just saw this total change the last eight months, and this person very close to me, thanks to you, and it's invaluable, and it's a total difference.
[01:03:47.946 --> 01:03:54.968]   It's like, night and day, how do people Get out of the mind control they're under.
[01:03:55.108 --> 01:03:57.030]  Why are you so popular with the young people?
[01:03:57.651 --> 01:03:59.313]  And how do adults watching this...
[01:04:00.407 --> 01:04:03.708]  Send their young people to you saying, oh, it's brash.
[01:04:03.828 --> 01:04:04.248]  Oh, it's this.
[01:04:04.428 --> 01:04:05.509]  Well, that's what humanity is.
[01:04:06.429 --> 01:04:09.870]  And sure, you may be what they call extreme because we're so domesticated.
[01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:12.211]  But really, a thousand years ago, you'd just be normal.
[01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:13.572]  You'd be a normal alpha male.
[01:04:13.592 --> 01:04:14.492]  You'd be a normal leader.
[01:04:15.212 --> 01:04:25.196]  So how do we take the success you've had that scares the hell out of them and getting young girls and boys, teenagers, college people to really break the spell?
[01:04:25.216 --> 01:04:26.336]  Because you've been doing it.
[01:04:27.116 --> 01:04:42.961]  Yeah, absolutely and I think that's what they're scared of because there's a huge swath of the population that aligns with my messaging and the reason they fear it is because I'm speaking to the youth of the world and telling them that the way they've been feeling when they've been feeling like they've been disaffected and forgotten about is not their fault.
[01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:53.064]  They try and delete me and replace me with some puppet like Logan Paul or James Charles or one of these mouthpieces and nobody feels affinity to these people because they know they're not brave.
[01:04:53.124 --> 01:05:10.858]   They know that they sold their souls and they know that they're just Parents which are repeating what they've been told to say I am inspiring the youth by actually standing up and talking about the issues which are true to them and they see that my reality is a reality they want to emulate and when you're a young man and you see a man whose life you want you're very likely to listen to his
[01:05:11.278 --> 01:05:14.378]  thoughts and opinions on how he should get there.
[01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:15.378]  That's all I'm doing.
[01:05:15.378 --> 01:05:16.878]  And I'm leading by example.
[01:05:16.878 --> 01:05:18.478]  And that's what they're truly, truly fearful of.
[01:05:18.478 --> 01:05:20.679]  They don't want me to make people to feel better.
[01:05:20.679 --> 01:05:21.679]  We're talking about your friend.
[01:05:21.679 --> 01:05:22.878]  I made your friend feel better.
[01:05:22.878 --> 01:05:23.878]  That's what they want.
[01:05:23.878 --> 01:05:24.478]  They don't want that.
[01:05:24.478 --> 01:05:25.978]  They don't want people to feel better.
[01:05:25.978 --> 01:05:27.278]  They don't want anyone to feel good.
[01:05:27.278 --> 01:05:29.278]   They don't want anyone to think they don't want anyone to have
[01:05:29.278 --> 01:05:30.378]  their own independent thoughts.
[01:05:30.424 --> 01:05:31.285]  They don't want any of that.
[01:05:31.345 --> 01:05:42.174]  What they want is mindless, soulless slaves, who are so depressed they can't think about anything outside of themselves, and they're busy popping medication and sitting around in a room in between shifts at their slave job.
[01:05:42.434 --> 01:05:43.135]  That's all they want.
[01:05:43.475 --> 01:05:44.997]  And they find me as a threat.
[01:05:45.037 --> 01:05:54.145]  They think I'm a threat to the system, purely because I encourage young men to get strong, train hard, find some brothers who they can rely on, and think for themselves.
[01:05:55.097 --> 01:05:55.737]  Well, that's it.
[01:05:55.938 --> 01:05:57.138]  And you said it.
[01:05:57.218 --> 01:05:58.239]  Aspire to something.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.741]  Young people aren't aspiring to anything.
[01:06:00.801 --> 01:06:05.624]  The left teaches them to be lazy, to be victims, to be depressed, and that's cool.
[01:06:05.825 --> 01:06:06.065]  No.
[01:06:06.605 --> 01:06:40.668]   When you're fighting in a business, or for your family, or for your life, or getting up to go to your friend's house when they need your help, and them helping you, that's the real brotherhood, the sisterhood, the human Community of being a clan and we're one human species that needs those goals And so people need to aspire and say I want to be successful Because it's not even getting to the success that matters It's aspiring to it is what you're supposed to do because you've got to have a purpose-driven life and a mission and these young people need a mission And you're giving them a mission
[01:06:41.940 --> 01:07:01.994]  Absolutely, and what's actually interesting is it's extremely hypocritical because when the shit hits the fan, when they need soldiers to go die in a war, when they need firemen to charge into a burning building, when they need police officers to hopefully save children in a school shooting and not just stand outside, when they need real men to go do real things, then they call on the men like me and the men who think like me.
[01:07:02.314 --> 01:07:07.017]  Then they want the men who are brave, who are masculine, who have tenets of masculinity, who have honor, who have duty.
[01:07:07.037 --> 01:07:07.698]  Then they want us.
[01:07:08.058 --> 01:07:15.161]  But as soon as they don't want us to go risk our lives to protect them, they say we're not allowed opinion, we're not allowed to think, we're not allowed to talk, and we should be depersoned and deleted.
[01:07:15.461 --> 01:07:20.863]  They try and use us, absolutely and utterly, because society needs men like us, and I'm the one who's been speaking up for them.
[01:07:21.123 --> 01:07:23.284]  They also pretend they give a shit about men's mental health.
[01:07:23.684 --> 01:07:25.605]  You told me one example about how I helped your friend.
[01:07:25.965 --> 01:07:32.348]  I have hundreds of thousands of emails for young men I've helped, and older men, who I've helped with their mindset and helped with their approach towards life.
[01:07:32.928 --> 01:07:36.090]  I have genuinely changed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people for the better.
[01:07:36.550 --> 01:07:50.817]  They talk about giving a shit about men and giving a shit about men's mental health while deleting me, the person who helps them the most, and saying they're going to replace me with some algo-rhythm matrix agent bot like Logan Paul who nobody respects and doesn't want to listen to.
[01:07:51.077 --> 01:07:55.159]  It's bullshit. If they gave a shit about men's mental health, they'd leave me up there to inspire the youth.
[01:07:55.499 --> 01:07:56.299]  They don't care.
[01:07:56.639 --> 01:07:58.080]  All they care about is narrative control.
[01:07:59.338 --> 01:08:00.679]  And we're going to dive into Andrew Tate.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:03.541]  I don't feel like platforming this guy.
[01:08:04.382 --> 01:08:14.590]  I don't feel like giving him the blessing of being my dance partner in the ring, especially after the social media platforms have made it very clear how they feel about this guy.
[01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:14.790]  Right.
[01:08:15.210 --> 01:08:24.598]  And I would even, I would even, I would even put a little call out here to like fellow creators and even JJ, like you want to replatform this guy?
[01:08:25.908 --> 01:08:26.208]  Anyone.
[01:08:26.509 --> 01:08:27.590]  You want to have him on your shows?
[01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:31.675]  You want to give him another opportunity to speak and spread his agenda?
[01:08:35.586 --> 01:08:54.607]  Believe it or not, the shit that Andrew Tate is saying will have a ripple effect, much more dangerous than you can imagine, because his narrative is truly hateful, his rhetoric has extreme negative energy in it, and it will affect impressionable young people in a way that will not show until years from now, and it is dangerous.
[01:08:54.807 --> 01:09:06.198]   On April 23, 1910, The iconic American president who busted up the Rockefeller Trust in America gave his incredibly historic speech, Citizen in a Republic.
[01:09:07.879 --> 01:09:11.601]  It was the man in the arena speech that sent shockwaves throughout the world.
[01:09:12.521 --> 01:09:13.922]  And I live by this creed.
[01:09:14.602 --> 01:09:23.908]  I'm about to read to you just a short excerpt of the 30 plus minute speech he gave to over 5 million attendees in Paris, France.
[01:09:24.968 --> 01:09:25.869]  We have released a coin.
[01:09:26.988 --> 01:09:30.343]  That has Teddy Roosevelt on the front and a gladiator on the back.
[01:09:32.005 --> 01:09:35.047]  Discusses a citizen of the Republic and the man in the arena.
[01:09:35.848 --> 01:09:41.832]  And Info Wars and everything we do is about the man and the woman in the arena fighting tyranny.
[01:09:42.513 --> 01:09:49.158]  It's the fourth coin in the series we've offered at PatriotCollectibles.com or 1776coin.com.
[01:09:49.658 --> 01:09:53.101]  There are only 10,000 of this coin available.
[01:09:53.881 --> 01:09:59.305]  Ladies and gentlemen, this coin is funding our operations as men and women in the arena.
[01:10:00.206 --> 01:10:02.627]  Let me read to you part of his famous speech.
[01:10:03.228 --> 01:10:09.992]  It's not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man has stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[01:10:10.412 --> 01:10:44.499]   The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again, Because there is no effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be amongst the cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:47.261]  This is the man in the arena coin.
[01:10:47.621 --> 01:10:48.942]  Only $10,000 in the world.
[01:10:49.322 --> 01:10:54.424]  Get yours now at 1776tocoin.com and take the info order to the next level.
[01:10:54.805 --> 01:10:56.785]  Are you gonna get in the ring with Logan Paul?
[01:10:58.366 --> 01:11:01.768]  Let's hope for his sake it never happens because he doesn't want to get hurt that badly.
[01:11:02.188 --> 01:11:05.790]  I just find it very interesting what happened to me and probably the same thing happened to you.
[01:11:06.550 --> 01:11:17.292]   During my banning, I saw in real time and learned which public figures, which talking heads, which are allowed to have a platform by the Matrix, actually have any kind of degree of character,
[01:11:17.292 --> 01:11:21.813]   and which ones will instantly bend, break, and swap, and change their opinion on you overnight
[01:11:21.813 --> 01:11:24.012]  because somebody above them told them they have to.
[01:11:24.012 --> 01:11:26.432]   You get to learn in real time who actually sticks up for you
[01:11:26.432 --> 01:11:31.173]   and it's true, and some people are, and which ones just instantly cave and comply.
[01:11:31.173 --> 01:11:34.813]   You'd be amazed how many people have absolutely no moral fiber.
[01:11:34.813 --> 01:11:39.612]   Well, how would you quantify, 'cause I know you have this, and I have it,
[01:11:39.612 --> 01:11:42.925]   like, when I know I'm right, I don't care about being attacked.
[01:11:43.105 --> 01:11:47.668]  And when I'm in the fight, politically or physically or whatever it is, I'm in ecstasy.
[01:11:48.288 --> 01:11:53.072]  And I see these unhappy men that don't get taken a chance standing up being a man.
[01:11:53.172 --> 01:11:54.713]  It's what you're supposed to do, dammit.
[01:11:55.533 --> 01:11:56.634]  And so they're not even alive.
[01:11:56.674 --> 01:11:57.415]  They're in a coma.
[01:11:57.855 --> 01:11:59.716]  And they think like you're some weird dinosaur.
[01:12:00.057 --> 01:12:03.719]  Well, they should try to become that dinosaur because they become nothing but jellyfish.
[01:12:03.759 --> 01:12:05.200]  I mean, can you describe what you get in the ring?
[01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:07.422]  World champion kicked all these people's ass.
[01:12:08.382 --> 01:12:20.450]  Yeah, and that's the essence of masculinity as a whole.
[01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:22.091]  I think it's always been about competition.
[01:12:22.492 --> 01:12:23.432]  I think it always has been.
[01:12:23.452 --> 01:12:29.677]  It's always been about respect, and respect comes from winning in different various forms of competition, whether it's money, financial, business, physical, etc.
[01:12:30.117 --> 01:12:32.939]  And there's so many men out there today that, you're right, nobody respects them.
[01:12:33.519 --> 01:12:35.060]  No, they are afraid of competition.
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.560]  They've been told by the Matrix they should be that way.
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:38.961]  They're unhappy with their lives.
[01:12:38.981 --> 01:12:40.281]  They're unhappy seeing others win.
[01:12:40.301 --> 01:12:41.922]  And then they become extremely hateful.
[01:12:41.942 --> 01:12:44.043]  And these are the exact people who pray for our downfall.
[01:12:44.423 --> 01:12:51.725]  You could line up a line of people and I can tell just by looking at them which ones like me and support me and which ones hate me.
[01:12:51.965 --> 01:12:53.086]  You can tell by their stature.
[01:12:53.106 --> 01:12:54.026]  You can tell by the way they talk.
[01:12:54.046 --> 01:12:55.046]  You can tell by their confidence.
[01:12:55.326 --> 01:12:56.827]  You can tell by so many different things.
[01:12:57.087 --> 01:12:59.968]  The successful people in the world are huge fans of mine.
[01:13:00.248 --> 01:13:02.550]  The successful people in the world want their children to listen to me.
[01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:05.033]  The successful people in the world realize I'm a force for good.
[01:13:05.333 --> 01:13:10.498]  The people who want to sit and pretend that I am somehow dangerous are people who are sad, miserable, and lonely.
[01:13:10.798 --> 01:13:12.820]  Hate never comes from above, it always comes from below.
[01:13:13.121 --> 01:13:19.427]  And these people are just desperate to try and find a way to attack an alpha male, and the only way they can do that is via these platforms run by betas.
[01:13:19.447 --> 01:13:20.728]  They can't attack us in the real world.
[01:13:20.948 --> 01:13:21.789]  Perfectly said.
[01:13:22.069 --> 01:13:30.474]  The globalists are a bunch of wimps, a bunch of nerds who hate humanity, hate women, hate men, and see themselves really as not even human.
[01:13:30.755 --> 01:13:39.240]  And they think if they can defeat human strength of family, men, women, children, and mount our head on the wall, that somehow now they're really the alpha.
[01:13:39.701 --> 01:13:49.187]  Instead of becoming an alpha and competing and getting in the ring, they want to isolate us and use technology to control us so they can play God.
[01:13:49.487 --> 01:13:50.568]  It's pathetic!
[01:13:51.608 --> 01:13:52.769]  I completely and utterly agree with you.
[01:13:52.809 --> 01:13:56.991]  This is the first time in human history where these type of people have had any kind of influence over people like us.
[01:13:57.552 --> 01:14:06.917]  Before this technology bullshit, when they saw people like us, they bowed down and showed respect, or they ran away, or they complied, or they followed us, or they were inspired by us and became something better.
[01:14:07.697 --> 01:14:09.398]  One of a few things happened.
[01:14:09.778 --> 01:14:15.240]  Never in a period of human history did you have a bunch of betas, dorks, and geeks who had the ability to shut the alphas up.
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:15.660]  Ever.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.561]  And now they've got this little bit of control and they think they're going to have it forever.
[01:14:18.601 --> 01:14:20.082]  And I completely and utterly disagree with that.
[01:14:20.362 --> 01:14:25.484]  I do not think God will allow the world to burn the way it would burn if these people retained control.
[01:14:25.784 --> 01:14:27.005]  I think something has to happen.
[01:14:27.245 --> 01:14:29.906]  And I do believe we're at the very, very beginning of a very large movement.
[01:14:30.384 --> 01:14:31.165]  Well, that's right.
[01:14:31.225 --> 01:14:32.987]  And real alphas aren't evil.
[01:14:33.007 --> 01:14:34.869]  You've got twisted people you can call alpha that are evil.
[01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:41.336]  But everywhere the left is in control is feces and needles and collapse and ugliness and pain and crime and destruction.
[01:14:41.796 --> 01:14:43.478]  Because at the end of the day, they're not leading.
[01:14:43.678 --> 01:14:47.843]  They're just annihilating leadership and undermining, and they're even undermining their own stance.
[01:14:47.923 --> 01:14:52.388]  All these globalists are building armored redoubts and fortresses, running from what they've done!
[01:14:52.908 --> 01:14:54.991]  They removed male leadership from the world.
[01:14:55.351 --> 01:14:56.593]  They set up a technocracy.
[01:14:56.633 --> 01:14:57.694]  Now things are collapsing.
[01:14:57.975 --> 01:14:58.976]  They feel like they're winning.
[01:14:59.336 --> 01:15:00.538]  They don't even understand chivalry.
[01:15:00.758 --> 01:15:03.061]  We didn't develop chivalry in the last few thousand years.
[01:15:03.081 --> 01:15:03.722]  We were wimps.
[01:15:04.082 --> 01:15:06.345]  We said, hey, let's just let men kill men and men compete.
[01:15:06.565 --> 01:15:08.308]  Let's not wipe everything out while we're doing it.
[01:15:08.508 --> 01:15:09.649]  Let's have some rules.
[01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:11.472]  And these guys have broken the rules.
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:14.201]  Oh, completely and utterly.
[01:15:14.501 --> 01:15:15.562]  You absolutely and utterly nailed it.
[01:15:15.582 --> 01:15:21.107]  And they don't even have enough self-accountability or enough honor or enough responsibility to look in the mirror and realize that they fucked up.
[01:15:21.307 --> 01:15:27.452]  They're just gonna run away, and they're gonna hire some alpha male armed guards, and they're gonna hire some big strong men to build them a bunker.
[01:15:27.532 --> 01:15:28.693]  Once again, more alpha males.
[01:15:28.713 --> 01:15:34.538]  They're gonna exploit alpha males because they managed to get some money, and they're gonna pay those guys, and they're gonna sit there and hide like a bunch of fucking cowards.
[01:15:35.979 --> 01:15:43.011]   And they don't know, because I know these people, I know you do, all Of the top tier people are just can't wait to kill the globalists once it goes down.
[01:15:43.031 --> 01:15:46.313]  I mean, they don't understand like their worst enemy sitting right next to them.
[01:15:46.493 --> 01:15:47.334]  They are so stupid.
[01:15:48.855 --> 01:15:49.495]  And that's the thing.
[01:15:49.535 --> 01:15:53.738]  I think in real time now, we're starting to live in a period of history after the lockdown after Corona.
[01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:56.120]  Now we have the problems going on in Europe with Russia and Ukraine.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:14.891]   We're living in a scenario now where politicians in most Western countries are ignoring the needs of their own people to try and support this idealistic View or this idealistic war somewhere else and there's large swath of the population recently in Czech Republic was huge protest, France was huge protest, Italy was protest, even in Germany is starting to protest.
[01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:17.492]  People are starting to understand their own politicians don't care about them.
[01:16:17.812 --> 01:16:30.417]  They're selling out their own people, selling out their own businesses, selling out their own energy sector, anything it takes to try and support some idealistic war somewhere else because they've been told to by higher power and people are starting to wake up saying this doesn't make sense.
[01:16:30.537 --> 01:16:31.938]  Nobody's actually representing us.
[01:16:33.019 --> 01:16:34.861]  And public consciousness is what they have to fear.
[01:16:34.921 --> 01:16:39.045]  The more people learn, the more people finally wake up, then they're going to have a serious, serious problem.
[01:16:39.966 --> 01:16:43.209]  Andrew, take the Great Reset, which is quantifying what you're saying.
[01:16:43.689 --> 01:16:53.139]  Top Fortune 500, artificially cut off the economy, pump credit out to people to control them, bring out a social credit score, universal basic income to dictate human behavior.
[01:16:53.892 --> 01:17:06.683]  While they're dissolving the very infrastructure that protects them and gives them all this science and medicine and wealth, and then they're pretending like they're going to manage this and get rid of most of us, and then they're going to survive with what's left.
[01:17:06.983 --> 01:17:10.747]  That is the stupidest, dumbest thing I've ever studied in history.
[01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:12.228]  It's destined to fail.
[01:17:12.548 --> 01:17:13.489]  It's already failing.
[01:17:14.767 --> 01:17:18.989]  Oh absolutely, but these people are completely arrogant and deeply narcissistic.
[01:17:19.329 --> 01:17:36.496]  They've been born into families or societies or systems where they're told for some reason they're somehow God, and they believe that they know everything, and they've never lived in the real world, they've never interacted with real people, and they're just spoiled children who've grown up inside of some silver spoon, coddled room, padded room bullshit.
[01:17:37.476 --> 01:17:40.977]  And they're fantasists, and that's what happens when you reach a certain level of arrogance.
[01:17:40.997 --> 01:17:43.017]  You become a full-on fantasist, like they are.
[01:17:43.277 --> 01:17:45.497]  It's a stupid idea, and it's absolutely destined to fail.
[01:17:45.738 --> 01:17:48.718]  What's unfortunate about it is it can't just fail in isolation.
[01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:51.619]  For it to fail, millions of people are going to suffer and die.
[01:17:51.979 --> 01:17:54.999]  And these people are not even going to have any kind of... They're not even going to have any empathy.
[01:17:55.019 --> 01:17:57.019]  They're not even going to feel bad for what they did.
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:59.800]  Because they've been born without it, because it's been bred out of them.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:01.460]  It's absolutely and utterly disgusting.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:05.501]  And what you said, this is the essence of what we face.
[01:18:06.061 --> 01:18:17.496]  It's not just a bunch of nerds and a bunch of control freaks that want to get rid of competition and alpha males and show up the system and what they call the final revolution, ending the normal healthy human cycle.
[01:18:17.917 --> 01:18:26.228]   It is the aristocratic royalty and inbred 20, 30 generations Where, you know, 300 years ago, if a king didn't lead an army, he would get assassinated.
[01:18:26.588 --> 01:18:28.990]  They haven't led armies in over a hundred years.
[01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:36.236]  They lay around, and they're all just being pampered by sycophants, and they're totally delusional.
[01:18:36.696 --> 01:18:44.683]  With a technocracy deploying something, attacking the very system that they're living off of, they're jumping the shark, and it's going to fail.
[01:18:45.432 --> 01:18:47.273]  Oh, absolutely, you completely nailed it.
[01:18:47.273 --> 01:18:48.233]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[01:18:48.233 --> 01:18:51.112]   And they have this supreme arrogance where they believe it's going to be okay.
[01:18:51.112 --> 01:18:52.792]  It's going to be okay for me because I have money.
[01:18:52.792 --> 01:18:56.912]   And to a degree it saved them up until this point and money can save you to a point,
[01:18:56.912 --> 01:19:01.952]   but it gets to in certain places like Sri Lanka, for example, when there's a large enough uprising
[01:19:01.952 --> 01:19:05.332]   of the populace and people have finally had enough, the money didn't save them over there.
[01:19:05.332 --> 01:19:07.492]   And it gets to a certain point where people have finally had enough.
[01:19:07.492 --> 01:19:12.452]   Listen, we're all human and we want to have safe families and safe neighborhoods.
[01:19:12.452 --> 01:19:15.792]   We want to have consensual, beautiful relationships and marriages.
[01:19:15.792 --> 01:19:17.511]  We want to feel happy and feel good.
[01:19:17.511 --> 01:19:21.172]   And unfortunately, under some of these laws they're making and some of the societies they're trying to create,
[01:19:21.172 --> 01:19:25.533]   it is literally impossible for a full grown man to have a happy, consensual relationship,
[01:19:25.533 --> 01:19:29.192]   feel safe and secure in his home and enjoy raising his children.
[01:19:29.214 --> 01:19:30.435]  That's becoming impossible.
[01:19:30.735 --> 01:19:33.836]  And as soon as you make that impossible for people, there's going to be massive backlash.
[01:19:34.997 --> 01:19:35.497]  Amazing.
[01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:40.194]   You know, in the 20 minutes we've got left, You're a great interview.
[01:19:40.334 --> 01:19:44.295]  I want to try to shut up and just let you roll here for viewers and listeners.
[01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:47.216]  There's something I do with guests I really want to hear from.
[01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:50.356]  For the next five minutes, Andrew Tate, I'm going to give you the floor.
[01:19:50.476 --> 01:19:53.457]  I've got a bunch of questions I want to ask, but you've got the floor here.
[01:19:54.257 --> 01:19:59.478]  Millions and millions are going to watch this, obviously, when the two most censored men in the world get together on air.
[01:20:01.059 --> 01:20:01.819]  Give us your treatise.
[01:20:04.025 --> 01:20:11.851]  Yeah, I have a lot I can talk about and a lot I can say, but I think that it's very, very important that we understand if we do not hang together, we will hang one by one.
[01:20:12.491 --> 01:20:16.694]  And it's important for people to sit here and think, well, he got banned.
[01:20:16.814 --> 01:20:18.275]  Maybe he was too extreme.
[01:20:18.335 --> 01:20:19.356]  This guy got banned.
[01:20:19.476 --> 01:20:21.818]  Maybe he said this one bad thing once.
[01:20:22.198 --> 01:20:23.059]  He got banned.
[01:20:23.359 --> 01:20:24.580]  Maybe the media has a point.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:25.701]  They don't have a point.
[01:20:26.181 --> 01:20:31.924]   If they had a genuine point, And they weren't afraid of open debate and discourse, then nobody would be getting banned at all.
[01:20:32.305 --> 01:20:38.888]  And they're pushing things far too close to the barrier, and they're doing that on purpose because they fear different ideas.
[01:20:39.429 --> 01:20:46.313]  I do believe that God has a plan for the world, and his plan is not to allow these people to completely and utterly burn it to the ground.
[01:20:46.793 --> 01:20:50.375]  I do believe that we're in a period of a redemption arc for humanity.
[01:20:50.855 --> 01:20:55.457]  And things have gotten dark now, but a ball always hits the bottom before it bounces to the top.
[01:20:55.877 --> 01:21:05.761]  But it's very important the people who are awake and the people who understand, not only try and educate as many people as possible, but also support each other and also support the leaders like yourself and like myself.
[01:21:06.081 --> 01:21:16.206]  We're out here taking on the risk and the responsibility of being completely deplatformed, depersoned, having serious threats on our safety and security to try and tell the truth.
[01:21:17.046 --> 01:21:24.250]  It's been a very interesting few years and we've seen what happens when people don't have a voice and don't stand up and try and repel against these systems.
[01:21:24.731 --> 01:21:31.375]  I really do think that the acts that have happened across these last few years in the name of trying to save lives for COVID have been genuinely, genuinely criminal.
[01:21:31.755 --> 01:21:38.479]  And I don't think they would have tested this kind of system or tested this kind of censorship and repression to just stop it and go back to normal.
[01:21:38.819 --> 01:21:40.320]  I think it was a test of a system.
[01:21:40.660 --> 01:21:47.227]  And they intend on coming in harder than ever before with some new story and some new excuse later on down the line.
[01:21:47.567 --> 01:21:52.732]  And that gets to a point where you finally have to stand up and realize that you cannot run from what is going to come to you.
[01:21:53.052 --> 01:21:53.973]  You cannot escape it.
[01:21:54.013 --> 01:21:54.894]  You cannot hide.
[01:21:55.175 --> 01:21:56.236]  You cannot deny it.
[01:21:56.516 --> 01:22:00.059]  You get to a point where you understand you need to find people who are like minded and stand up.
[01:22:00.740 --> 01:22:07.922]  And the best way you can stand up at this current point in time is just to educate others and just to highlight the injustices which are being purported by these systems.
[01:22:08.422 --> 01:22:10.383]  My banning was absolutely and utterly unjust.
[01:22:10.583 --> 01:22:11.843]  I never broke any terms of service.
[01:22:12.243 --> 01:22:12.803]  They know that.
[01:22:13.063 --> 01:22:14.244]  The whole world knows that now.
[01:22:14.784 --> 01:22:16.704]  And the public sentiment is on my side.
[01:22:17.145 --> 01:22:26.667]  And the more people talk about this and the more people discuss this and tell others and educate others, the harder it's going to be for them to keep this curtain, this iron curtain of theirs, over the truth.
[01:22:27.087 --> 01:22:28.528]  Because that's all they truly want to do.
[01:22:29.548 --> 01:22:31.948]  Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:22:32.008 --> 01:22:34.189]  Everyone knows this saying and it's completely and utterly true.
[01:22:34.589 --> 01:22:36.969]  And we're now in a situation where they have absolute power.
[01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:44.091]  But I do believe that we're moving to a transitional period, a transitional place, and you've been a massive leader in that force.
[01:22:44.391 --> 01:22:51.212]  And even now, as much as they say you're banned, anybody who types your name into a lot of these Matrix-led platforms can still find videos of you.
[01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:55.393]  So they can't completely and utterly shut you up because people want to listen to what you have to say.
[01:22:55.953 --> 01:23:02.760]  People want to hear you and it's for that reason that they fear you because they try and take men like us, delete us and replace us with these talking heads.
[01:23:03.140 --> 01:23:07.685]  But humans have an instinct and that instinct allows us to feel affinity with somebody.
[01:23:07.925 --> 01:23:13.571]  They can hear your voice or mine and know they want to hear what we have to say because they know we have character and we're integral and we have morals.
[01:23:13.972 --> 01:23:16.154]  These talking heads don't have any of that.
[01:23:16.474 --> 01:23:20.536]  So when they put them there to read from the hymn sheet, it simply doesn't resonate with the youth of today.
[01:23:20.556 --> 01:23:26.860]  And that's how I managed to become the most Google man on the planet, by just telling men the truth about the experience they're going through and the life they're going to live.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.401]  It's a really interesting period of human time.
[01:23:29.782 --> 01:23:35.605]  And I've really been appreciative also of your support and support of the other mainstream characters who stood up and said, listen, this has gone on long enough.
[01:23:36.405 --> 01:23:37.266]  Well, it certainly has.
[01:23:37.306 --> 01:23:38.667]  The people are hungry for freedom.
[01:23:39.067 --> 01:23:42.566]   Let's talk about how the enemy is going to strike back because they're Definitely in trouble.
[01:23:42.626 --> 01:23:44.007]  The whole world's turning against them.
[01:23:44.647 --> 01:23:47.307]  But I'm really concerned about false flags ahead of the midterms.
[01:23:48.048 --> 01:23:50.228]  We already see them cutting the power off all over the world.
[01:23:50.628 --> 01:23:54.429]  They said we're going to go big with environmentalism and power outages in the undercover.
[01:23:54.809 --> 01:23:57.210]  Video from Project Veritas about eight months ago.
[01:23:57.290 --> 01:23:58.490]  We now see that happening.
[01:23:59.110 --> 01:24:02.351]  How do you see these control freaks striking back?
[01:24:03.919 --> 01:24:04.939]  Well, this is what's scary.
[01:24:04.959 --> 01:24:08.341]  It's because power and energy is the absolute base for any country on the planet.
[01:24:08.361 --> 01:24:10.522]  If you don't have energy or power, you have nothing else.
[01:24:10.582 --> 01:24:11.442]  You don't have security.
[01:24:11.502 --> 01:24:12.243]  You don't have safety.
[01:24:12.263 --> 01:24:13.283]  You don't have food production.
[01:24:13.563 --> 01:24:14.864]  You don't have absolutely anything.
[01:24:15.204 --> 01:24:18.545]  So they're going down to the very, very core and very, very crux of humanity now.
[01:24:19.006 --> 01:24:23.828]  Once power outages start becoming a mainstream thing, it's not just about not being able to turn on your television.
[01:24:23.908 --> 01:24:24.768]  It's about crime.
[01:24:25.148 --> 01:24:27.349]  It's about people dying on the street.
[01:24:27.749 --> 01:24:29.530]  It's about emergency services.
[01:24:29.650 --> 01:24:30.931]  It's about food production.
[01:24:31.291 --> 01:24:33.072]  It's about so many more important things.
[01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:34.913]   And it's, It's truly evil.
[01:24:35.313 --> 01:24:46.262]  But when you get insulated like these people are at the level they're at completely insulated from the consequences of their own actions, they're prepared to sacrifice a few palms in their own mind to try and win the chess game.
[01:24:46.563 --> 01:24:49.405]  And that's what they see us as they see us as disposable and expendable.
[01:24:50.026 --> 01:24:51.727]   And Yes, we're living in 2022.
[01:24:51.987 --> 01:24:56.992]  We're living in a society and a world which is very, very technologically advanced.
[01:24:57.272 --> 01:24:59.915]  There is no reason for anywhere to be running out of power.
[01:24:59.995 --> 01:25:01.436]  We've had electricity for long enough.
[01:25:01.756 --> 01:25:07.402]  And when that starts happening, to believe it's some kind of accident or coincidence is asinine.
[01:25:07.842 --> 01:25:21.213]  It is impossible in the current world we live in with all the current resources and all the smart people on the planet and the fact that we all know we need electricity and the fact that we had all the electricity we needed in the 80s to now be here 40 or 50 years later and say we can't generate electricity.
[01:25:21.534 --> 01:25:23.455]  That is clown world fantasy.
[01:25:24.916 --> 01:25:26.658]  And the globalists said they were going to cut the power off.
[01:25:26.698 --> 01:25:29.740]  They cut off thousands of coal power plants here alone while China builds three a week.
[01:25:30.361 --> 01:25:31.542]  They have shut us down.
[01:25:31.602 --> 01:25:38.363]   This is warfare against the West because the Western ideal Cannot operate when the globalists have all these other countries under slavery.
[01:25:38.603 --> 01:25:42.955]  People will aspire to Western freedom and so it has to be gotten rid of.
[01:25:42.975 --> 01:25:43.596]  Can you speak to that?
[01:25:45.123 --> 01:25:49.906]  Oh yeah, completely and utterly, and they have to change society and change the basis on which society is run.
[01:25:50.247 --> 01:25:53.109]  Society was run in the West on the premise of freedom.
[01:25:53.429 --> 01:25:57.231]  You can come to the West and if you comply with the law, we will provide you with freedom.
[01:25:57.592 --> 01:26:02.215]  They've realized that, like you said, that doesn't give them enough control, and that's what tyrants are obsessed with.
[01:26:02.515 --> 01:26:07.899]  So they want to replace freedom with safety, because it's the only thing that people will accept their freedom being taken away for.
[01:26:07.919 --> 01:26:10.741]  We're going to take all your freedom away, but don't worry, you're going to be safe.
[01:26:11.081 --> 01:26:12.601]  You'll be safe from the common cold.
[01:26:12.881 --> 01:26:14.322]  You'll be safe from whatever else.
[01:26:14.662 --> 01:26:17.202]  So they're trying to destroy our freedoms and replace it with safety.
[01:26:17.242 --> 01:26:22.024]  Now, to replace freedom with safety, you need to convince people that they're in danger.
[01:26:22.304 --> 01:26:23.064]  How do you do that?
[01:26:23.364 --> 01:26:36.427]  Well, you either create a media spin and convince everyone the common cold is somehow deadly, or what you can do is you can cause blackouts, cause mass crime rates to increase, cause mass famine, and put people in danger for real.
[01:26:36.727 --> 01:26:40.852]  Because when they're in real danger and they're really scared, then they'll really sign up for safety.
[01:26:41.152 --> 01:26:50.603]  If there's only going to be one town in the whole state that has electricity, you're going to agree with whatever piece of paper they make you sign, whatever rules you have to agree to, you're going to agree to get in.
[01:26:50.864 --> 01:26:51.745]  And that's what they're trying to do.
[01:26:52.734 --> 01:26:53.395]  And they admit that.
[01:26:53.935 --> 01:27:07.747]  Club of Rome, Bilderberg Group, and its spokesperson Klaus Schwab, WEF, says, we're going to get rid of the old system, that's the great reset, to build back better, and you're going to have a universal basic income with program tokens that tell you where and how and when you can spend that money.
[01:27:07.887 --> 01:27:09.589]  I mean, that is beyond the mark of the beast.
[01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:16.640]  Oh absolutely, because if anybody understands the world, understands that every single system on the planet is absolutely and utterly corrupt.
[01:27:17.040 --> 01:27:21.083]  The judicial system is corrupt, the law system is corrupt, the medical systems are now corrupted.
[01:27:21.384 --> 01:27:22.104]  Everything's corrupt.
[01:27:22.124 --> 01:27:25.286]  So any system that involves humanity at any level is going to have a degree of corruption.
[01:27:25.306 --> 01:27:32.031]  And if you think they're going to give you these tokens and it's going to be somehow fair and non-corrupt, you are an idealist at best and an idiot at worst.
[01:27:32.372 --> 01:27:33.713]  Probably a combination of the two.
[01:27:34.113 --> 01:27:40.177]   I often say to people, if you go to a poker game and there's no referee, And there's $5,000 at stake.
[01:27:40.197 --> 01:27:42.559]  Do you think people would cheat without any kind of referee?
[01:27:42.579 --> 01:27:44.120]  And people say, well, yeah, probably.
[01:27:44.461 --> 01:27:57.430]  So if you understand that people will cheat in a poker game or a basketball game for menial amounts of money without any kind of judge or referee, how are you going to sit and then believe that the most powerful people on the planet to control nations and control entire populaces are not going to cheat and bend the rules?
[01:27:57.711 --> 01:27:58.311]  Of course they are.
[01:27:58.351 --> 01:27:59.032]  This is human nature.
[01:27:59.052 --> 01:28:00.233]  That's absolutely what they're going to do.
[01:28:00.433 --> 01:28:01.514]  They're not going to risk losing.
[01:28:01.954 --> 01:28:04.516]  So they're going to cheat and lie and be corrupt their entire way.
[01:28:04.776 --> 01:28:06.878]  That's the only thing they're interested in is absolutely not our power.
[01:28:07.898 --> 01:28:10.360]  Let's talk about something that doesn't get enough attention.
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.821]  Yes, we know we're deplatformed.
[01:28:11.841 --> 01:28:14.384]  Yes, we know we're demonized because we're pro-human leaders.
[01:28:14.844 --> 01:28:16.325]  Yes, we know the power structure is scared.
[01:28:16.365 --> 01:28:19.928]  But I see this all over Instagram, all over Twitter, on the street.
[01:28:20.789 --> 01:28:24.372]  Every time I go out, people go, man, I used to be a really big listener.
[01:28:25.253 --> 01:28:26.114]  Are you still on air?
[01:28:26.861 --> 01:28:38.189]  Only a minority of our hardcore, really smart people go to InfoWars.com or go to your website or understand that they're the ones that have got to get the clips and get them out on their own platforms or on the establishment's platform.
[01:28:38.209 --> 01:28:40.631]  So I know people watching today are like, well, that's common sense.
[01:28:40.651 --> 01:28:44.133]  You know, I tell everybody, you know, about Tate's website or Alex Jones's website.
[01:28:44.413 --> 01:28:45.334]  But this is a war.
[01:28:45.694 --> 01:28:48.837]  The propaganda wouldn't be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[01:28:49.197 --> 01:28:51.799]  But the situation was dire and it couldn't be turned around.
[01:28:52.479 --> 01:28:53.400]  And they'd already won.
[01:28:54.238 --> 01:28:55.600]  Then they wouldn't need to censor us.
[01:28:55.700 --> 01:28:55.920]  No.
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:58.943]  Freedom is incredibly popular and it's our destiny.
[01:28:59.484 --> 01:29:03.588]  And just because evil always tries to take full control and create monopolies doesn't mean it's going to win.
[01:29:03.628 --> 01:29:05.070]  In fact, it always destroys itself.
[01:29:05.410 --> 01:29:08.293]  So we need to get pre-positioned, as you said, on the upward arc.
[01:29:08.634 --> 01:29:10.556]  I believe we're going to get into better times soon.
[01:29:11.336 --> 01:29:19.319]  We have to get prepositioned and realize, even the sociopaths out there that keep going along with tyranny, they'd get way further ahead going against the system.
[01:29:19.659 --> 01:29:21.999]  And I think that's going to be the biggest part of the tipping point we've already reached.
[01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:27.521]  Not just good people saying no, but even people that are just mercenaries saying, this is a destructive system.
[01:29:27.781 --> 01:29:28.762]  This isn't empowering me.
[01:29:28.782 --> 01:29:36.464]  So on those two points, I know you've got several websites and we put them on screen, but it's critical that everyone say, we're all Andrew Tate.
[01:29:36.744 --> 01:29:37.765]  We're all Alex Jones.
[01:29:38.065 --> 01:29:44.408]  We are all going to promote what is being attacked by the enemy because we know whatever they're attacking is the antidote to the poison.
[01:29:44.428 --> 01:29:47.649]  So I'm going to ask all the viewers and listeners, take this interview and share it.
[01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:49.170]  Go to Andrew's website.
[01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:49.971]  Go to my site.
[01:29:50.311 --> 01:29:51.071]  Share these clips.
[01:29:51.131 --> 01:29:51.832]  Take clips out.
[01:29:52.332 --> 01:29:53.552]  Show it to your employees.
[01:29:53.612 --> 01:29:54.333]  Show it to your boss.
[01:29:54.633 --> 01:29:55.433]  Show it to your church.
[01:29:55.773 --> 01:29:56.714]  Show it to everybody.
[01:29:56.934 --> 01:29:59.876]  Because this is what the bad guys don't want you to know.
[01:30:00.236 --> 01:30:02.777]  That means it's got to be magnified and amplified.
[01:30:02.837 --> 01:30:04.558]  So again, the best site for people to visit.
[01:30:05.816 --> 01:30:06.536]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:30:06.556 --> 01:30:07.437]  You're completely right, though.
[01:30:07.477 --> 01:30:12.259]  The enemy wants you to be lethargic, lazy, and perhaps even distracted with their bullshit entertainment.
[01:30:12.559 --> 01:30:16.140]  They don't want you to get out there and do the real groundwork of educating other people and waking them up.
[01:30:16.180 --> 01:30:16.601]  And you're right.
[01:30:16.641 --> 01:30:18.842]  This is a war, and that's the most important thing that people can do.
[01:30:19.382 --> 01:30:21.162]  I can be reached at CobraTape.com.
[01:30:21.643 --> 01:30:23.243]  You can go there and sign up to my email list.
[01:30:23.303 --> 01:30:26.525]  It's completely and utterly free, where I send out a daily email on world events.
[01:30:27.185 --> 01:30:29.247]  I recommend everybody get to CobraDate.com first.
[01:30:29.687 --> 01:30:30.708]  I have some other products on there.
[01:30:30.728 --> 01:30:36.333]  I have The War Room, which is my private network for people who think exactly like I do, 5,000 people all around the world, which is The War Room.
[01:30:36.353 --> 01:30:38.836]  It can be accessed through the website, but CobraDate.com for now.
[01:30:38.876 --> 01:30:41.516]   The mailing list is free and I look forward to speaking to people on there and I keep
[01:30:41.516 --> 01:30:42.676]  the whole world updated with my life.
[01:30:42.676 --> 01:30:46.516]   We got about six, seven minutes left and you got to jump on a plane and I've got to do
[01:30:46.516 --> 01:30:47.516]  my Thursday show.
[01:30:47.516 --> 01:30:52.916]   We're going to be airing this on the Monday show and posting it to Band.Video.
[01:30:52.916 --> 01:30:54.676]  And so that's the coordinates of victory, folks.
[01:30:54.676 --> 01:30:55.676]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[01:30:55.676 --> 01:31:00.735]   Go to the sound of the guns, as George Washington said back during the Revolutionary War.
[01:31:00.735 --> 01:31:02.996]  We are going to win this thing together.
[01:31:02.996 --> 01:31:06.914]   Your brother, there was a clip I played a few weeks ago on the show right when you first
[01:31:06.914 --> 01:31:13.115]   got banned where he read a Bible verse on air and literally said, "This is full mobilization
[01:31:13.198 --> 01:31:14.339]  Everybody's got to go to rumble.
[01:31:14.759 --> 01:31:16.140]  You're also done a deal with rumble.
[01:31:16.180 --> 01:31:16.780]  That's beautiful.
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:17.700]  That's all exploding.
[01:31:18.201 --> 01:31:22.363]  When I say switch to rumble, let me hit you with Matthew 7, 24 to 7.
[01:31:24.464 --> 01:31:38.812]  Everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock and the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat on that house but it did not fall because it had been founded on the rock.
[01:31:39.412 --> 01:31:54.437]  And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like the foolish man who built his house on the sand and the rain fell and the floods came and the wind blew and beat against the house and it fell and a great fall it was.
[01:31:54.937 --> 01:32:07.301]  Start today, move to Rumble, move your social medias to Gitter, let's get on these apps that are run by real men who want to hear discourse, who want to hear different people's opinions, different people's points of view.
[01:32:07.662 --> 01:32:08.622]  And this is the future.
[01:32:09.903 --> 01:32:13.983]   What's beautiful about genetics, but also then will and leadership,
[01:32:13.983 --> 01:32:20.143]   your dad being world champion chess player and so much more, is the left acts like physical brawn means you're stupid.
[01:32:20.143 --> 01:32:22.582]   But in my experience, I found a lot of times the most physically
[01:32:22.582 --> 01:32:25.103]  prowess people also the greatest mental prowess.
[01:32:25.103 --> 01:32:28.703]   But it's just beautiful to know that it's not just we got Andrew Tate,
[01:32:28.703 --> 01:32:34.543]   but then we've got your brother who is, I think, just as articulate and amazing as him.
[01:32:34.543 --> 01:32:36.622]  And so it's almost like a double-head Hydra.
[01:32:36.622 --> 01:32:40.143]   And can you speak to trying to boost and magnify your brother,
[01:32:40.143 --> 01:32:42.302]  who's already a big top fighter and so much more?
[01:32:42.302 --> 01:32:44.143]  Let's talk about your brother.
[01:32:44.698 --> 01:32:45.659]  My brother's an amazing man.
[01:32:45.699 --> 01:32:49.162]  He's the best brother anyone could ever reach for, and we have an extremely close relationship.
[01:32:49.202 --> 01:32:50.883]  That's something else that The Matrix tries to do.
[01:32:50.943 --> 01:32:54.245]  It tries to separate brothers from one another, and it tries to separate men from one another.
[01:32:54.585 --> 01:32:57.968]  There's nothing wrong with men having an affinity with each other and working together.
[01:32:58.028 --> 01:33:02.931]  The way of man has always been to be in armies, to be in gangs, to be in clans.
[01:33:03.191 --> 01:33:04.612]  This is how men have always been.
[01:33:04.652 --> 01:33:05.633]  This is how we operate the best.
[01:33:05.653 --> 01:33:06.954]  This is how we keep each other in check.
[01:33:07.214 --> 01:33:09.256]  That's where we bring out our best powers and prowesses.
[01:33:09.296 --> 01:33:26.856]   And I often say to men out there, That's what the war room's for to find other men on your wavelength healthy competition to test each other to challenge each other and to bring out the best of one another and they want you isolated as a man because when you're isolated you don't have so much power the lone wolf the idea of Rambo being all by himself and being lone wolf
[01:33:27.236 --> 01:33:28.196]  It's a bit of a fallacy.
[01:33:28.216 --> 01:33:34.117]  You need a team, you need a network, you need people who are on your side, people who support you, people who understand you and where you're trying to go.
[01:33:34.417 --> 01:33:43.499]  That's what the War Room's doing in a digital form, but my brother and I, in the real world, yeah, we're the closest we could ever be, and he's an amazing guy, and I know he'd love to come on the show and talk to you as well.
[01:33:44.019 --> 01:33:47.120]  I'd love to get him on, so just name the time, or I need to get in touch with him.
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:49.020]  I know he gave me his number, but I've never gotten in contact with him.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:49.360]  I should.
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:54.381]  But what you said is key here, and we're reaching this point where it's like Fight Club.
[01:33:55.367 --> 01:34:06.555]  I haven't talked to you about this before I went on air, but I would imagine you're getting way more support, way more high fives from people everywhere now that it's 100% clear that you're the enemy of the establishment.
[01:34:06.575 --> 01:34:08.336]  So there's a paradox.
[01:34:08.376 --> 01:34:12.419]  As long as people support us and boost us, we'll just become more effective for humanity.
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:17.743]  So people shouldn't buy into the lies that just because the enemy attacks you, you know, that means you're losing.
[01:34:17.983 --> 01:34:19.905]  When in truth, as long as we keep fighting, we're going to win.
[01:34:21.187 --> 01:34:23.770]  Absolutely, they've martyred us and they proved us completely and utterly right.
[01:34:24.170 --> 01:34:24.931]  They proved us right.
[01:34:25.351 --> 01:34:27.653]  Now no one can come along and say we're incorrect anymore.
[01:34:28.054 --> 01:34:31.957]  They may be able to come along and say we're on platforms, that's fine, but we're certainly and utterly correct.
[01:34:32.358 --> 01:34:35.901]  And in the long run, God rewards those who live with a true heart and speak the truth.
[01:34:36.361 --> 01:34:38.163]  Alright, a few other big topics I want to hit with you.
[01:34:39.024 --> 01:34:46.516]   What is Europe going to do As they try to bring in new lockdowns, as they say, flatten the curve by cutting your power off, don't take showers anymore.
[01:34:46.897 --> 01:34:48.397]  How does that tie into blaming Russia?
[01:34:48.437 --> 01:34:49.377]  I'm not a Russophile.
[01:34:49.398 --> 01:34:50.878]  I'm not blindly supporting Putin.
[01:34:51.138 --> 01:34:55.960]  I know what he is, but the West admits they overthrew the government eight years ago in Ukraine, put weapons in.
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:35:00.982]  I know special forces that have been there training people to kill Russians in the ongoing war over the last eight years.
[01:35:01.042 --> 01:35:01.863]  I know Green Berets.
[01:35:01.943 --> 01:35:02.783]  I know Navy SEALs.
[01:35:03.386 --> 01:35:06.466]   that have been there helping kill Russians and they don't even like what's happening
[01:35:06.466 --> 01:35:09.826]   but they've been over there under orders for eight years killing Russians to get Putin
[01:35:09.826 --> 01:35:11.105]  to finally come in.
[01:35:11.105 --> 01:35:12.186]  How do you see this ending?
[01:35:12.186 --> 01:35:13.746]  How is the war really going?
[01:35:13.746 --> 01:35:14.746]  How does all this unfold?
[01:35:14.746 --> 01:35:18.746]   Because they put huge sanctions on Russia for six, seven months and then Russia finally
[01:35:18.746 --> 01:35:22.987]   put sanctions back and they're claiming the power is being cut off because the Russians,
[01:35:22.987 --> 01:35:25.866]  the Germans turned off all their nuclear power plants.
[01:35:25.866 --> 01:35:29.225]  The Germans cut down the gas pipelines.
[01:35:29.225 --> 01:35:30.746]  Northern Europe's got more gas than the US.
[01:35:30.746 --> 01:35:31.746]  They won't pump it.
[01:35:31.746 --> 01:35:35.106]   I mean it's the left cutting the energy off, not Vladimir Putin.
[01:35:35.106 --> 01:35:36.907]  It's the left starting the fight with Russia.
[01:35:36.907 --> 01:35:40.266]  So that's a gestalt but your take on all that?
[01:35:40.266 --> 01:35:43.346]   No you're completely and utterly right and it's actually going to be a rude awakening
[01:35:43.346 --> 01:35:46.947]  for these idealists to be snapped into the real world.
[01:35:46.961 --> 01:35:52.263]  All these people who have Ukraine flags on their Instagram bio are now not going to be able to afford their own energy bills.
[01:35:52.303 --> 01:35:59.905]  And you're going to learn that realism and the real world, if you ignore it for long enough, has a habit of coming back and slapping you in the face.
[01:36:00.405 --> 01:36:04.086]  All the politicians in Europe have seemed to forget about their own constituents.
[01:36:04.526 --> 01:36:10.249]  To just be obsessed with somehow fighting an unwinnable war in Ukraine and some other country.
[01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:12.270]  The populations are starting to have enough of it.
[01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:15.732]  We don't want you to fight an unwinnable war on some faraway land.
[01:36:16.012 --> 01:36:17.613]  We want hot water in our house.
[01:36:17.973 --> 01:36:19.534]  That's why we elected you.
[01:36:19.814 --> 01:36:23.996]  And how long are you going to ignore our needs and continue to talk about some other war in some other place?
[01:36:24.356 --> 01:36:25.457]  People are starting to wake up.
[01:36:25.993 --> 01:36:32.077]  The head of the German economy, their head economy minister said yesterday, get used to not having craft small businesses.
[01:36:32.477 --> 01:36:34.218]  You're not going to be open anymore because of energy.
[01:36:34.358 --> 01:36:35.339]  Only big businesses are.
[01:36:35.699 --> 01:36:36.659]  Same thing they did with COVID.
[01:36:36.719 --> 01:36:37.800]  It is a direct open war.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:42.523]  Then one of the top German ministers said, we don't care what the voters want.
[01:36:42.583 --> 01:36:43.784]  We're going to war with Russia.
[01:36:44.004 --> 01:36:46.905]  So just in closing, where do you see that hubris going?
[01:36:47.025 --> 01:36:50.748]  And how do you see this Ukraine situation that's so dangerous ending?
[01:36:50.828 --> 01:36:52.749]  Or where's the way out of this?
[01:36:54.409 --> 01:37:06.257]  The way out, which the West do not want to accept, is that the war is unwinnable and they need to sit with Putin and agree to some terms and to stop being tyrannical and stop trying to put weapon systems on the border and stop trying to expand NATO.
[01:37:06.577 --> 01:37:14.102]  The way out is for the West to finally accept that they've been wrong and to just do a deal with Putin and allow a certain degree of Ukraine to fall.
[01:37:14.422 --> 01:37:18.745]  The way out is going to be hard for them to accept because they've been preaching nothing but the opposite for so long.
[01:37:19.125 --> 01:37:31.829]  But as the populations run out of hot water, as the populations can't put gas in their cars, there's going to be mass civil unrest, and any politician who even cared about his own people wouldn't be concerned about the war in Ukraine, he'd be concerned about all the repercussions of it.
[01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:48.998]   These people are bought and sold, and they are dancing to some other tune coming from somewhere else, from high, high above, and they have been told to annihilate their own economies and destroy their own constituents to try and And take part in a war which is completely and utterly unwinnable.
[01:37:49.038 --> 01:37:53.383]  And as more and more people realize that, there's going to be massive unrest in Europe in the coming months.
[01:37:54.241 --> 01:37:55.121]  I totally agree.
[01:37:55.681 --> 01:37:56.382]  I totally agree.
[01:37:56.462 --> 01:37:57.922]  And there already is massive unrest.
[01:37:57.962 --> 01:38:03.764]  And if the left thinks, as Schwab said, Klaus Schwab, they're going to parlay that into people accepting the Great Reset, no!
[01:38:04.064 --> 01:38:12.167]  You go to the rallies in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Germany, France, everybody's protesting Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, and the New World Order.
[01:38:12.187 --> 01:38:16.788]  I've got to say this in closing, Andrew Tate, it is a real pleasure to be in the same league as you.
[01:38:17.128 --> 01:38:17.809]  I admire you.
[01:38:17.849 --> 01:38:18.969]  Your strength is my strength.
[01:38:19.589 --> 01:38:28.152]  And I appreciate what you've done, and it just feels good to be part of the great renaissance, the great awakening, not the great reset.
[01:38:28.232 --> 01:38:33.694]  And so, as Patrick Henry said, you know, those of you that want to serve tyranny, crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.
[01:38:33.994 --> 01:38:36.435]  But as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:38:36.475 --> 01:38:44.696]   And as Teddy Roosevelt said, It is the man in the arena, whether you win or you lose, that's the animating contest, that's the exhilaration, and we are the men in the arena.
[01:38:45.016 --> 01:38:46.497]  Andrew Tate, thanks for being strong.
[01:38:46.737 --> 01:38:48.437]  Look forward to having you on again very, very soon.
[01:38:48.457 --> 01:38:50.618]  There's a lot of amazing things that are going to be unfolding.
[01:38:50.978 --> 01:39:04.441]  And again, everybody should visit your website that's on screen right now and support what you're doing, because you, my friend, are among the few that are at the real tip of the spear, and together we're going to help lead humanity out of this tyranny back to the real human order and to the stars and beyond.
[01:39:04.761 --> 01:39:05.781]  Andrew Tate, thank you so much.
[01:39:06.718 --> 01:39:07.305]  Thank you, sir.
[01:39:07.385 --> 01:39:08.093]  Thank you very much.

[01:39:20.797 --> 01:39:25.140]  And please support Mr. Tate, because even if he was a bad guy, the enemy's scared of him.
[01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:28.362]  He's a good guy, ladies and gentlemen, and I am fully in support of him.

[01:40:40.793 --> 01:40:43.175]  But whatever you do, don't be a spectator.
[01:40:43.515 --> 01:40:47.799]  Be the man in the arena and share this interview now to everyone you know.
[01:40:47.939 --> 01:41:04.179]  God bless and good luck.
[01:41:04.179 --> 01:41:11.818]   The rage for more than a decade have been concentrated green powders with wheatgrass

[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:08.620]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:42:08.369 --> 01:42:15.369]   It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:42:15.369 --> 01:42:21.369]  [Music]
[01:42:21.369 --> 01:42:29.369]   Alright folks, we know that corporate media, globalist media is a fraud and they're out to get us.
[01:42:29.317 --> 01:42:29.857]  We already know that.
[01:42:33.450 --> 01:42:41.952]  And we've always, at least I've always heard for decades, that the New York Times bestseller list is extremely political about what they allow on it.
[01:42:43.473 --> 01:42:44.853]  The story's a lot bigger than that.
[01:42:45.874 --> 01:42:48.634]  This is about, in my view, organized fraud.
[01:42:50.315 --> 01:43:03.481]   Because imagine if it's a nationalist or populist book that is popular and goes to the top five or ten or number one, and they block it, Well that's what they're going to do with ratings.
[01:43:03.701 --> 01:43:08.163]  It came out that Nielsen will give higher ratings to CNN or MSNBC than they actually have.
[01:43:09.203 --> 01:43:13.925]  Or they'll cheat in an election and give more votes to the establishment candidate than the other.
[01:43:14.665 --> 01:43:15.706]  What it is is fraud.
[01:43:16.166 --> 01:43:17.906]  They're willing to put their finger on the scale.
[01:43:19.967 --> 01:43:25.249]  And so there was a big article out on Friday breaking Alex Jones' blast of the New York Times bestseller list is pure fraud.
[01:43:25.749 --> 01:43:26.870]  Pretty powerful headline.
[01:43:27.495 --> 01:43:31.197]  But I should have come up with the headline, New York Times Caught in Massive Fraud.
[01:43:33.919 --> 01:43:45.446]  Because our book, published by Skyhorse Publishing, The Great Reset and War for the World, went to number two on a bunch of other major charts, to the top ten routinely on Amazon.
[01:43:47.787 --> 01:43:52.170]  That's not counting books getting sold all these third-party places, just in a few places they track.
[01:43:52.890 --> 01:44:05.387]   It was really number one, and it didn't even make it Into the New York Times bestseller list and books that sold a fraction made it to the top.
[01:44:06.728 --> 01:44:09.529]  That's emblematic of a scam.
[01:44:10.749 --> 01:44:16.731]  So Tony Lyons is the founder and CEO and owner of Skyhorse, which is the biggest independent book publisher in the country.
[01:44:16.751 --> 01:44:17.911]  I think it has the most courage out there.
[01:44:17.931 --> 01:44:20.672]  That's why I published my book with Tony Lyons.
[01:44:20.712 --> 01:44:22.172]  He joins us to talk about this.
[01:44:23.053 --> 01:44:24.473]  We can also put the book on the screen.
[01:44:26.442 --> 01:44:28.503]  I had a copy here with me, but somebody took it off my desk.
[01:44:29.984 --> 01:44:31.385]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[01:44:32.285 --> 01:44:43.832]  I've talked to friends and family in Dallas and Austin who went into bookstores and in one case, there was five books.
[01:44:44.713 --> 01:44:47.014]  By the time she left, there was one book left.
[01:44:47.114 --> 01:44:47.694]  She bought one.
[01:44:48.855 --> 01:44:49.776]  That's while she was there.
[01:44:50.603 --> 01:44:52.304]  And it was a similar story out of Dallas.
[01:44:52.344 --> 01:44:54.046]  So thanks for everybody getting this book.
[01:44:54.086 --> 01:44:55.487]  It's a political statement to have it.
[01:44:55.847 --> 01:44:57.028]  It's the blueprint of the new world order.
[01:44:57.048 --> 01:44:57.708]  They don't want it read.
[01:44:58.069 --> 01:45:00.410]  And imagine if this went to number one, which we know it really did.
[01:45:01.892 --> 01:45:04.854]  Imagine how big that would be for a cultural statement.
[01:45:05.634 --> 01:45:10.878]  But just like they'll steal an election, ladies and gentlemen, they will engage the type of behavior.
[01:45:11.139 --> 01:45:12.840]  But we just get punch drunk to it.
[01:45:13.871 --> 01:45:14.511]  Tony, don't we?
[01:45:14.891 --> 01:45:18.193]  We just get punch drunk to them engaging in this type of behavior.
[01:45:18.633 --> 01:45:22.474]  What would you call it as the publisher of the Great Reset and the War for the World?
[01:45:22.834 --> 01:45:24.215]  What would you call this type of activity?
[01:45:24.515 --> 01:45:28.476]  And unlike corporate media, we're going to show people the other bestseller lists.
[01:45:29.697 --> 01:45:30.957]  We're on multiple top lists.
[01:45:30.977 --> 01:45:38.240]  We're number two and a bunch of others were in the top five, top ten, and then doesn't even make the so-called vaunted New York Times bestseller list.
[01:45:38.260 --> 01:45:51.273]   That is a total red-handed Yeah, you know, it's exactly what's covered in your book.
[01:45:51.293 --> 01:46:00.781]  I mean, this kind of thing is the great reset in that they want to control what you do, what you think, and what you read.
[01:46:01.221 --> 01:46:07.646]  And they use their bestseller list as a way to convince people that something is worth reading.
[01:46:07.906 --> 01:46:09.868]  So it's a recommended reading list.
[01:46:10.167 --> 01:46:16.688]   So this book sold more than any other hardcover nonfiction book in America last week.
[01:46:16.688 --> 01:46:19.686]  And it was nowhere on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:46:19.686 --> 01:46:25.027]   So there was a there was a book on that list that sold 3,500 copies.
[01:46:25.027 --> 01:46:30.747]   Your book, Alex, sold nine times as many copies as that book and didn't make it on their list.
[01:46:30.747 --> 01:46:33.107]  I mean, it's absolute fraud.
[01:46:33.107 --> 01:46:37.947]   And they are telling you, I mean, they are falsely claiming that this book isn't selling
[01:46:37.947 --> 01:46:38.947]  well.
[01:46:38.947 --> 01:46:41.947]  And it's the best selling book in America this week.
[01:46:42.027 --> 01:46:45.470]  So, it's insane, and we need to really fight against it.
[01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:55.459]  That the best-selling book in America doesn't make that list, you can't read about it in any mainstream newspaper, it's a total media silence, media blackout.
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:06.760]  And, you know, your viewers have to recognize what's happening here, that you've written an important book, and the subject matter of the book is exactly what's happening to the book.
[01:47:07.344 --> 01:47:10.166]  That they're trying to exercise total control.
[01:47:10.526 --> 01:47:16.631]  And what all the big tech platforms do with this kind of book is they don't allow you to advertise for it.
[01:47:17.031 --> 01:47:18.192]  They take likes off.
[01:47:18.632 --> 01:47:24.097]  They put this kind of friction on it so that it makes it really hard for people to find it.
[01:47:24.477 --> 01:47:26.378]  So they play around with the algorithms.
[01:47:26.819 --> 01:47:33.824]  So these companies are trying to control what you see, what you do, what you think, everything.
[01:47:34.485 --> 01:47:36.329]  And that's what this book is about.
[01:47:36.630 --> 01:47:38.575]  And that's why this book is so important.
[01:47:39.297 --> 01:47:39.577]  Tony!
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.581]  Tony, you just said it way better than I can say it.
[01:47:43.001 --> 01:47:50.666]  I mean, to quantify this, it's number one a nonfiction, number two book in the world according to Wall Street Journal, and according to a bunch of other major lists.
[01:47:51.186 --> 01:47:52.667]  The New York Times says no.
[01:47:53.488 --> 01:48:00.292]  Yeah, we know we claim something's a bestseller, because people believe in the knowledge of the crowd, but we're going to lie to you and tell you other stuff is.
[01:48:00.932 --> 01:48:02.393]  I mean, this really is fraud.
[01:48:02.473 --> 01:48:04.134]  It's absolutely insane.
[01:48:04.474 --> 01:48:06.816]  It shows we'd win the culture war overnight.
[01:48:07.416 --> 01:48:10.599]  If they would just stop this censorship, it's a very ballsy move.
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:16.844]  Yeah, I mean, this is just insane censorship and they know what they're doing.
[01:48:17.425 --> 01:48:21.829]  And I called them up and I asked them, what's the story here?
[01:48:21.849 --> 01:48:26.553]  You can look at NPD book scan and you see this, this monster number.
[01:48:26.993 --> 01:48:30.015]  How is it that you don't put it on the bestseller list?
[01:48:30.376 --> 01:48:34.691]   And they said, well, The sales didn't meet our standards.
[01:48:35.051 --> 01:48:36.692]  So I said, what do you mean by that?
[01:48:37.233 --> 01:48:39.655]  And they said, the sales didn't meet our standards.
[01:48:39.715 --> 01:48:41.456]  So I said, please clarify that.
[01:48:41.956 --> 01:48:45.259]  They then came back and said, it's just about sales.
[01:48:45.299 --> 01:48:49.262]  So I said, is this about the fact that it's Alex Jones?
[01:48:49.762 --> 01:48:54.325]  Is it about the fact that it's a subject matter that you disagree with?
[01:48:54.705 --> 01:48:57.127]  And they said, absolutely not, it's just sales.
[01:48:57.467 --> 01:49:06.272]  So, they're so used to lying to the American public that they have no qualms about saying something that's so blatantly untrue.
[01:49:06.352 --> 01:49:10.635]  There's no way that this is about anything other than the subject matter.
[01:49:10.995 --> 01:49:12.856]  They don't want you to read this book.
[01:49:13.177 --> 01:49:15.518]  They don't want you to think about this book.
[01:49:15.618 --> 01:49:22.445]   They don't want you to believe that this is the best-selling book That's just amazing.
[01:49:23.145 --> 01:49:34.759]  And what I've anecdotally heard from friends and family about it, you know, the book being at the front of the store but selling out quickly, you were telling me on the phone the other day that, yeah, you're seeing massive orders at the bookstore levels.
[01:49:34.819 --> 01:49:37.002]  That's going to really freak out the establishment.
[01:49:38.869 --> 01:49:39.189]  Sure.
[01:49:39.229 --> 01:49:44.752]  I mean, they will do everything to make it less likely that people buy this book.
[01:49:44.812 --> 01:49:48.374]  You know, like I said, there are going to be libraries that don't carry it.
[01:49:48.674 --> 01:49:53.956]  You know, small, privately owned bookstores all across the country are boycotting the book.
[01:49:55.417 --> 01:49:58.359]  They're not going to let us advertise for it, like I said before.
[01:49:58.439 --> 01:50:07.263]  So all of these different kind of frictions... So they're in the book business, but they're really in the 1984 business of banning books.
[01:50:08.914 --> 01:50:09.214]  Sure.
[01:50:09.554 --> 01:50:15.215]  You know, they specifically say that they won't carry books now that they disagree with.
[01:50:15.455 --> 01:50:20.316]  So there are hundreds of bookstores in this country that will not take even a special order.
[01:50:20.657 --> 01:50:29.078]  So if you call up a bookstore and say, I want 10 copies of Alex Jones's The Great Reset, they will say, we don't carry that book.
[01:50:29.118 --> 01:50:30.099]  We don't want the order.
[01:50:30.399 --> 01:50:32.019]  And these are struggling bookstores.
[01:50:32.438 --> 01:50:42.144]  So they feel so sort of empowered and so convinced that censorship is the right way to run a business.
[01:50:42.664 --> 01:50:48.928]  And, you know, the truth is that if you have a better argument, you don't need censorship.
[01:50:49.349 --> 01:50:54.812]  If they could address the claims in this book and disprove them, they would do that, right?
[01:50:55.072 --> 01:51:00.676]  I mean, why do they need to try to prevent people from reading the book by playing all these games?
[01:51:01.431 --> 01:51:07.534]  If they have a real argument, if they could have a debate with you over these things that are happening in this country.
[01:51:07.774 --> 01:51:08.895]  But they don't want debate.
[01:51:08.915 --> 01:51:17.519]  They don't believe in debate because they're fascists and they're trying to force you to do what they want you to do and to think what they want you to think.
[01:51:17.739 --> 01:51:18.299]  Well, that's right.
[01:51:18.339 --> 01:51:22.381]  I mean, talk about we're going to break with the Streisand effect, the arrogance of doing this.
[01:51:22.461 --> 01:51:26.163]  And I guess they think it's going to work, but it looks like so far it hasn't.
[01:51:26.203 --> 01:51:28.844]  Thanks to all the great listeners and viewers that have gotten the book.
[01:51:29.324 --> 01:51:33.327]  And so this is a real political war here to continue to hammer this out.
[01:51:33.367 --> 01:51:33.907]  We come back.
[01:51:34.348 --> 01:51:37.049]  Tony Lyons, owner of Skyworks Publishing, they have the courage to put this book out.
[01:51:37.490 --> 01:51:39.711]  Number one nonfiction in the world right now.
[01:51:40.071 --> 01:51:45.095]  We'll show you some of the actual charts where it's number one and number two, number five, number ten around the world.
[01:51:45.515 --> 01:51:48.057]  Number one nonfiction book in the world right now.
[01:51:48.637 --> 01:51:49.478]  A huge success.
[01:51:49.838 --> 01:51:50.739]  Freedom is popular.
[01:51:51.239 --> 01:51:57.223]  But the tyrants that we're battling, we talk about this book, are trying to suppress what you can read and what you have access to.
[01:51:57.563 --> 01:51:58.224]  Truly shameful.
[01:52:01.513 --> 01:52:07.095]  Tony Lyons, owner and publisher at Skyhorse Publishing, put out The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[01:52:07.896 --> 01:52:11.077]  He was telling me during the break he's never seen anything like it.
[01:52:11.097 --> 01:52:17.400]  The New York Times will push titles down, but if a book's number one, they've never taken it out of the bestseller list.
[01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:19.740]  This is fraud next level.
[01:52:20.001 --> 01:52:21.701]  They claim they're showing you bestselling books.
[01:52:22.041 --> 01:52:23.242]  They're lying to you and you're not.
[01:52:23.582 --> 01:52:27.284]  The other big charts show number two, number five, number ten, number six.
[01:52:27.844 --> 01:52:29.905]  We're going to go over those in a minute, but sir, you've got the floor.
[01:52:30.025 --> 01:52:30.565]  Lay this out.
[01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:39.328]  Yeah, so in 25 years of publishing books, I've published 59 New York Times bestsellers.
[01:52:39.728 --> 01:52:42.351]  I've seen the New York Times play all kinds of games.
[01:52:42.672 --> 01:52:49.640]  I've seen them take books that should have been number one and make it number five, make it number seven, but I've never seen them do this.
[01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:56.502]  Where a book outsold any other book in the country in its category, and they did not put it on anywhere.
[01:52:56.862 --> 01:52:58.843]  And then they claimed that it was about sales.
[01:52:59.203 --> 01:53:02.544]  I mean, that is an absolute fraud on the American public.
[01:53:03.104 --> 01:53:10.366]  And, you know, if you look at some of the blurbs that we got for this book, you know, I want to just read a couple of things that people said.
[01:53:10.786 --> 01:53:17.908]  So Tucker Carlson said, if Alex Jones is just a crackpot, why are the most powerful people in the country trying to silence him?
[01:53:18.613 --> 01:53:29.923]  So you see that here, that the New York Times is trying to silence him, that, you know, every major newspaper is trying to silence him, that the government doesn't want you to read this book.
[01:53:30.003 --> 01:53:30.904]  And why is that?
[01:53:30.984 --> 01:53:34.147]  It's because they're afraid of the message in this book.
[01:53:34.808 --> 01:53:39.992]  Stephen Bannon says that people should read the book, read the book and decide for yourself.
[01:53:40.573 --> 01:53:49.117]   You know, that's, you know, What people need to do, what they need to have the right to do in a democracy is get real information.
[01:53:49.877 --> 01:53:58.700]  And, you know, what's happened over the last two years is that we've been told that the government or that big tech companies want to protect us from misinformation.
[01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:06.822]  But what it's really come down to is that they just want to tell their narrative and they want to get rid of every other narrative.
[01:54:07.262 --> 01:54:12.044]  And that's what Alex Jones is talking about in this book, that we have to protect freedom.
[01:54:12.651 --> 01:54:16.659]  And there are a bunch of things that you can do to help get this message out.
[01:54:16.999 --> 01:54:34.897]   So I would like people to go onto Facebook, to go onto YouTube, to go onto Instagram and say that the New York Times is committing the worst kind of fraud on the American public, that they took the number one best-selling book and they didn't list it anywhere.
[01:54:35.497 --> 01:54:49.325]  And that has to be called out and people have to be alerted to the kinds of things that are happening, that all the big tech platforms now have been enlisted by the government to shut out any kind of dissent.
[01:54:49.955 --> 01:55:02.357]  That they're trying to prevent what they call confusion, and they're using what they call friction, which is de-emphasizing books, de-listing books, making it harder for people to find things.
[01:55:02.677 --> 01:55:06.678]  And one of the ways that they do that is by keeping it off bestseller lists.
[01:55:08.678 --> 01:55:09.738]  A very bold move.
[01:55:10.258 --> 01:55:14.519]  They're afraid of this because it's a countervailing narrative to their globalist narrative.
[01:55:14.539 --> 01:55:19.120]  They don't want a debate to be about a bunch of multinational corporations announcing the end of freedom.
[01:55:21.599 --> 01:55:21.859]  Right.
[01:55:21.959 --> 01:55:30.801]  So, but what's really so shocking there is that exactly the same kinds of things that you're describing in this book are being used against this book.
[01:55:31.561 --> 01:55:41.944]  And they are trying, you know, trying kind of tooth and nail, doing everything they can do to get you not to get, you know, viewers and readers not to read the book.
[01:55:42.444 --> 01:55:45.284]  And I think you're going to see that more and more in the coming days.
[01:55:45.604 --> 01:55:49.823]   This is a playbook that they've described in pamphlets that they put out,
[01:55:49.823 --> 01:55:54.584]   where they say that they're gonna partner with all kinds of places,
[01:55:54.584 --> 01:55:59.064]   that the government's gonna partner with big tech companies to make sure
[01:55:59.064 --> 01:56:02.244]  that the general public doesn't get any misinformation.
[01:56:02.244 --> 01:56:07.623]   And anytime you hear that word now from the government, it should be a red flag.
[01:56:08.005 --> 01:56:11.027]  That this book is not misinformation.
[01:56:11.307 --> 01:56:13.768]  This is a narrative that they don't like.
[01:56:14.148 --> 01:56:20.772]  And if they have a good argument against the thoughts in this book, they should come out and make those arguments.
[01:56:21.032 --> 01:56:24.994]  They should disprove what Alex Jones says, not censor him.
[01:56:25.254 --> 01:56:28.796]  It's un-American, it's unconstitutional, and it has to stop.
[01:56:29.936 --> 01:56:32.758]  And we're unlike corporate media, we'll actually show you the real list.
[01:56:33.524 --> 01:56:34.625]  I've got the Wall Street Journal.
[01:56:34.645 --> 01:56:35.706]  I've got a bunch of others here.
[01:56:36.187 --> 01:56:37.448]  Number two, Wall Street Journal.
[01:56:37.488 --> 01:56:38.769]  Number two, Publishers Weekly.
[01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:42.553]  Number ten, USA Today, which includes all categories, including textbooks.
[01:56:43.133 --> 01:56:45.456]  Not even shown on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:56:45.916 --> 01:56:46.697]  Total fraud.
[01:56:47.177 --> 01:56:48.038]  Here's the actual numbers.
[01:56:48.078 --> 01:56:48.719]  Tell us about this.
[01:56:50.876 --> 01:56:55.718]  Yeah, so the Wall Street Journal made it the number two book.
[01:56:56.219 --> 01:57:09.125]  And the claim that I saw there was that there were about 6,000 copies sold that didn't actually get shipped because the book was selling so quickly in a four or five day period.
[01:57:09.445 --> 01:57:14.107]  So something like 36,000 were ordered, but only 30,000 shipped.
[01:57:14.147 --> 01:57:17.089]  So maybe the Wall Street Journal wasn't playing games there.
[01:57:17.449 --> 01:57:18.509]  That's kind of hard to tell.
[01:57:18.849 --> 01:57:42.262]   But the New York Times Clearly, this is a game, this is fraud, and they're really struggling to tell their readers one narrative and to make sure that you don't get any other narrative, that you don't know the truth, you don't know what's selling, you don't know what people believe, you don't know what people are interested in, and if they can do that with a book, they can do it about anything.
[01:57:42.562 --> 01:57:51.907]   So you have to look at any story that a place like the New York Times publishes And wonder whether that itself is real misinformation.
[01:57:52.247 --> 01:57:57.209]  Where they're just telling a story because they want you to believe that story.
[01:57:57.550 --> 01:57:58.750]  Not because it's factual.
[01:57:58.810 --> 01:58:00.911]  Not because it's based on research.
[01:58:01.051 --> 01:58:05.053]  And not because it's based on, in this case, the number of copies sold.
[01:58:05.911 --> 01:58:14.238]  Well, Tony, I want to commend you and thank you for your courage and the fact I've been interviewing you for many years at Infowarshore.com.
[01:58:14.258 --> 01:58:17.920]  We've sold hundreds of titles, like Robert F. Kennedy's book that came out that was huge.
[01:58:18.701 --> 01:58:20.102]  And you said, hey, let's do this.
[01:58:20.182 --> 01:58:21.783]  And so I said, OK, I'll do it.
[01:58:21.803 --> 01:58:24.646]  And your courage doing this, because obviously you're going to get targeted.
[01:58:24.666 --> 01:58:27.168]  You're going to be attacked for what you've done.
[01:58:27.208 --> 01:58:34.018]   But regardless of your political bent, This is just pro-freedom to do this.
[01:58:34.718 --> 01:58:37.240]  And so I'm just blessed that you've been here, you've been involved in this.
[01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:42.702]  But I guess in closing, did you even expect the censorship to be this intense?
[01:58:45.003 --> 01:58:50.205]  I did not think in my wildest dreams that they would totally keep it off the bestseller list.
[01:58:50.625 --> 01:58:58.989]  I mean, I've seen a lot of stories coming out of the New York Times that I believe are just untrue.
[01:58:59.525 --> 01:59:05.830]  And I've seen all kinds of games on big tech platforms to make it less likely that you can buy something.
[01:59:06.130 --> 01:59:12.875]  But they are going, they are getting to the depths of corruption and of censorship.
[01:59:13.435 --> 01:59:17.418]  And, you know, this is something that I'm going to fight against for the rest of my life.
[01:59:17.538 --> 01:59:25.804]  I mean, people have asked me whether I'm afraid of standing up to these powerful forces that want to control what people think and read.
[01:59:26.364 --> 01:59:29.348]  And my position is I would be afraid not to.
[01:59:29.368 --> 01:59:36.275]  I would be afraid to live in a world where I couldn't and wasn't willing to fight against these kinds of things.
[01:59:36.556 --> 01:59:43.844]  And I'm glad to be partnering with you on this book because I've seen that you are fighting against these same kinds of forces.
[01:59:44.765 --> 01:59:46.327]  We got 50 seconds left.
[01:59:47.794 --> 01:59:51.580]  As negative as this is, and as sad as it is, they're showing themselves.
[01:59:51.620 --> 01:59:52.882]  We forced them out in the open.
[01:59:53.603 --> 01:59:57.710]  And so I think in the end we're going to win, because now they're acting like complete and total tyrants.
[01:59:59.119 --> 02:00:04.122]  Yeah, because this is so blatant that people ought to realize it.
[02:00:04.802 --> 02:00:19.530]  And that's what's happened during this whole two-year period now, that there's been so much censorship, so much deplatforming of sort of doctors and scientists and writers and anybody who disagrees with a very specific narrative.
[02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:30.014]  And so what's happened is you went from sort of a counterculture of people who, you know, didn't believe the New York Times narrative or the U.S.
[02:00:30.094 --> 02:00:32.915]  government narrative on certain subject matters.
[02:00:32.935 --> 02:00:33.895]  Tony, Tony, don't hang up.
[02:00:34.155 --> 02:00:36.316]  I got Alex Stein popping in briefly from Tucker Carlson.
[02:00:36.336 --> 02:00:37.476]  I'm gonna come back to you.
[02:00:37.496 --> 02:00:38.156]  Do one more segment.
[02:00:38.476 --> 02:00:38.937]  Live!
[02:00:41.217 --> 02:00:42.598]  Live, New York Times.
[02:00:44.184 --> 02:00:48.347]  Gentlemen, we have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government.
[02:00:48.647 --> 02:00:54.570]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:55.511 --> 02:00:58.013]  You still think that jet fuel brought down the World Trade Center?
[02:01:00.094 --> 02:01:02.575]  Does anybody else see a problem here?
[02:01:03.036 --> 02:01:08.379]  If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions?
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:11.301]  This story does not add up.
[02:01:13.587 --> 02:01:14.747]  Alright, here's the bottom line.
[02:01:14.767 --> 02:01:17.208]  This isn't even about bringing in money.
[02:01:18.308 --> 02:01:19.108]  It does some of that.
[02:01:19.288 --> 02:01:27.429]  It's about culturally having the number one book and the people exposing Klaus Schwab and the Great Reset of the New World Order and the Death Star plan of their operation.
[02:01:28.090 --> 02:01:29.950]  And that's why it was the number one book.
[02:01:30.450 --> 02:01:37.431]  And that's why the New York Times censored it when they're supposedly the most prestigious group that tells you what America's reading and what the people think.
[02:01:37.791 --> 02:01:41.572]  That's a fraud on their readers, on their supporters.
[02:01:42.625 --> 02:01:43.486]  But we're not going to give up.
[02:01:44.567 --> 02:01:48.772]  This is already a huge victory against their tyranny.
[02:01:49.793 --> 02:01:51.495]  The Great Reset and the War for the World.
[02:01:52.356 --> 02:01:56.700]  And there are a lot of important places to get it, but wherever you get it, call your bookstores when it sells out.
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:01:57.401]  Ask for more.
[02:01:58.242 --> 02:01:59.323]  Do your Christmas shopping.
[02:01:59.683 --> 02:02:00.825]  Don't battle the crowds.
[02:02:00.865 --> 02:02:03.688]  Don't wait, you know, months and drive around in all the traffic.
[02:02:04.648 --> 02:02:19.072]  Just order 5, 6, 7 copies of the book right now at Amazon.com, or M4WarsTore.com, or Skyhorse, or Barnes & Noble, wherever, and know that it's a revolutionary act to share this book, and that the enemies of free speech are scared of it.
[02:02:20.553 --> 02:02:23.634]  Piss in the face of the New York Times.
[02:02:24.354 --> 02:02:30.596]  Let them know you're aware of what they've done, because believe me, they're scared of the fact that I have the number one Joe Rogan podcast.
[02:02:30.996 --> 02:02:31.356]  Three of them.
[02:02:32.233 --> 02:02:43.833]  They're scared of the fact that freedom is so popular and they don't want to recognize that you recognize the truth and justice and freedom, plus the information in this book is insane.
[02:02:44.985 --> 02:02:45.846]  It's their own words.
[02:02:45.926 --> 02:02:46.986]  It's their own admissions.
[02:02:47.026 --> 02:02:50.288]  It's like Hitler wrote Mein Kampf saying what he would do, but people ignored it.
[02:02:50.608 --> 02:02:53.670]  We're showing you in their own words what they said they would do, and they're doing it.
[02:02:53.690 --> 02:02:57.131]  This is like their Mein Kampf, but I wrote it for them to bring them down.
[02:02:57.672 --> 02:03:01.533]  So, Tony Lyons, in closing, how do people beat the censorship?
[02:03:01.613 --> 02:03:02.394]  How do they defeat it?
[02:03:02.814 --> 02:03:04.175]  The system's scared of this weapon.
[02:03:04.615 --> 02:03:08.397]  Everybody should use this book as a rallying point right now, because that's what it is.
[02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.730]  Definitely.
[02:03:10.751 --> 02:03:16.396]  I mean, buying this book is an act of rebellion against the things that are described in this book.
[02:03:16.877 --> 02:03:22.362]  And they are using the methods that are described in this book against the book itself.
[02:03:22.782 --> 02:03:32.192]  So like I said, if you have a better argument, and I mean the New York Times, if the New York Times has a better argument, they don't need to censor the book.
[02:03:32.512 --> 02:03:33.713]  They're afraid of the book.
[02:03:33.994 --> 02:03:35.875]  They can't answer the allegations.
[02:03:36.176 --> 02:03:37.817]  They must know that they're true.
[02:03:38.338 --> 02:03:49.049]  But, you know, for the New York Times, which is a news organization, to do everything they can to lie to the American people about the sales of a book in its first week.
[02:03:49.656 --> 02:03:53.139]  You know, that's what have we come to as a country.
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:58.084]  And, you know, like you were saying, there are periodicals that come out.
[02:03:58.184 --> 02:04:02.608]  This is one that says that they're going to do all these kinds of things.
[02:04:02.868 --> 02:04:03.889]  This is from the U.S.
[02:04:03.929 --> 02:04:04.790]  Surgeon General.
[02:04:05.110 --> 02:04:11.916]  And it basically says that they're going to have these kind of public and private partnerships, the kinds of things described in this book.
[02:04:12.719 --> 02:04:18.901]  To stifle dissent, to make sure that you can't get other ideas, other narratives.
[02:04:19.241 --> 02:04:21.141]  So, this is an important book.
[02:04:21.482 --> 02:04:26.383]  I would like you guys to go on to social media to tell the world what's going on here.
[02:04:26.703 --> 02:04:33.945]  This was the best-selling book in America, and the New York Times is not listing it, not reviewing it, not saying a word about it.
[02:04:34.405 --> 02:04:42.729]   And, you know, Alex Jones has an important message that people have to read, and I would like to read Joe Rogan's blurb about Alex Jones.
[02:04:42.809 --> 02:04:46.892]  It says, Alex is right about far more than he's wrong about.
[02:04:46.912 --> 02:04:49.594]  He's the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[02:04:49.974 --> 02:04:55.238]  So, all the people who think that they disagree with you, Alex, they have to read this book.
[02:04:55.338 --> 02:04:57.339]  That's what happens in a democracy.
[02:04:57.699 --> 02:05:04.104]  If you're going to say you disagree with a book, you have to read it, you have to think about it, and then make a better argument.
[02:05:04.424 --> 02:05:19.099]  And everybody else, all of you people who have already bought copies, and who know what Alex Jones stands for, and what he said in this book, you should, like I said, go on social media, tell the world what's going on here, and expose all of these incredible... You're absolutely right.
[02:05:19.118 --> 02:05:22.398]   More importantly than just buying another copy to give us a gift, and that's important,
[02:05:22.398 --> 02:05:27.358]   is to now tell people why you got the book and do a review on YouTube, Twitter, Facebook,
[02:05:27.358 --> 02:05:31.637]   Instagram, and exercise your free speech and say, "I read the book, here's what I think."
[02:05:31.637 --> 02:05:34.717]   And I'm trying to think of a headline for this show that we're live right now, but I'm
[02:05:34.717 --> 02:05:38.198]   going to re-air part of it tomorrow after the Andrew Tate interview we're going to premiere.
[02:05:38.198 --> 02:05:40.637]  But I mean, it's breaking news.
[02:05:40.657 --> 02:05:43.318]  New York Times caught in massive censorship scandal.
[02:05:43.858 --> 02:05:47.020]  Suppresses number one book in the world for political views.
[02:05:47.601 --> 02:05:51.723]  I mean, this is a big deal and they're trying to just normalize they can do stuff like this.
[02:05:51.803 --> 02:05:53.184]  No, it's not normal.
[02:05:53.244 --> 02:05:54.145]  That's what tyrants do.
[02:05:54.485 --> 02:05:55.145]  Hitler did it.
[02:05:55.285 --> 02:05:55.986]  Stalin did it.
[02:05:56.406 --> 02:05:56.926]  Mao did it.
[02:05:56.946 --> 02:05:58.127]  Fidel Castro did it.
[02:05:58.467 --> 02:05:59.488]  Hugo Chavez did it.
[02:05:59.808 --> 02:06:02.149]  They try to just normalize this type of crap.
[02:06:02.189 --> 02:06:03.190]  This is outrageous.
[02:06:04.577 --> 02:06:10.204]  People have to know that when they go on the internet now, they can see things that aren't true.
[02:06:10.304 --> 02:06:14.369]  When they read the New York Times, they can read things that just blatantly aren't true.
[02:06:14.750 --> 02:06:27.477]   You know, you can have a book that, you know, doesn't have any likes, for example, because the Specific platform doesn't like that book, so they take the likes down.
[02:06:27.797 --> 02:06:30.078]  So we've seen that in book after book.
[02:06:30.358 --> 02:06:36.941]  But this book, so far, it's got more than 500 reviews, and they're, you know, almost all five-star.
[02:06:37.241 --> 02:06:38.762]  So the people are speaking.
[02:06:38.802 --> 02:06:43.184]  The people who are actually reading the book are really getting... That's important, too.
[02:06:43.204 --> 02:06:44.845]  On Amazon, like a 99% positive rating.
[02:06:44.865 --> 02:06:47.326]  I mean, this thing's getting five stars everywhere.
[02:06:48.976 --> 02:06:56.841]  Yeah, so we have to watch it closely to make sure that they don't start taking down any of those, because that's what they've done in the past.
[02:06:57.341 --> 02:07:06.066]  And we have to hold their feet to the fire, hold the mainstream media's feet to the fire, that they have to cover the stories that people really care about.
[02:07:06.386 --> 02:07:13.752]  And they have to write about the books, and like I said, even if they disagree, they have to make an argument of why they disagree.
[02:07:13.772 --> 02:07:20.358]  Well that's right, and Tony, something we saw certain about 10 years ago, but now it's almost everywhere, all these big newspapers, almost all of them got rid of comments.
[02:07:20.778 --> 02:07:25.302]  Now YouTube, a pro Alex Jones quote, or a pro Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:07:25.362 --> 02:07:30.762]   quote, Uh, by somebody who may have 10,000 likes, it's way down the bottom.
[02:07:30.802 --> 02:07:33.926]  Something with five dislikes is the top single bad thing.
[02:07:34.306 --> 02:07:37.329]  YouTube even admits they put negative stuff up on top.
[02:07:37.690 --> 02:07:45.719]  So this is at every level they're trying to stop the average person from having their voice heard, and this book is a major rallying point in that fight.
[02:07:47.068 --> 02:07:59.782]   That's a great point that you brought up, because with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.' 's book, The Real Anthony Fauci, the number one review was written by Dr. Mercola, and it had something like 7,500 likes.
[02:08:00.303 --> 02:08:01.524]  And that was just taken down.
[02:08:01.925 --> 02:08:05.349]  So now the top positive review has only 59 likes.
[02:08:06.790 --> 02:08:08.172]  And the top negative one has 2,500.
[02:08:08.212 --> 02:08:10.535]  I mean, I see it all the time.
[02:08:10.555 --> 02:08:13.358]  They'll have some article that I have child porn that's totally not true.
[02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:18.745]  And then they'll have some dude with 500 likes at the top and somebody with 20,000 views cut out.
[02:08:18.785 --> 02:08:25.093]  I mean, this is organized brigades of fraud going on as the establishment tries to suppress human will.
[02:08:26.638 --> 02:08:29.040]  This is, you know, this is the ministry of truth.
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:32.562]  This is 1984 happening before our eyes.
[02:08:32.942 --> 02:08:34.984]  And that's what this book is about.
[02:08:35.044 --> 02:08:36.965]  That's what The Great Reset is about.
[02:08:37.385 --> 02:08:44.810]  It's about all of these incredible processes that have been instituted in this country to take away your freedom.
[02:08:44.990 --> 02:08:46.211]  And now they're trying to make it permanent.
[02:08:46.251 --> 02:08:52.715]  So in closing, it's critical everybody, folks, why battle the lines and the traffic and all of it?
[02:08:53.456 --> 02:08:54.677]  Seriously, this is a serious war.
[02:08:54.697 --> 02:08:56.438]  I just want to stay on air and beat these people.
[02:08:57.239 --> 02:08:59.601]  Go get 5-10 copies.
[02:08:59.841 --> 02:09:01.022]  End your Christmas shopping now.
[02:09:01.403 --> 02:09:05.046]  Where is the best place for people to go buy the book where it sells so many copies?
[02:09:05.066 --> 02:09:06.908]  Because we're just counting the weeks since it came out.
[02:09:06.968 --> 02:09:10.472]  It had even way more sales than pre-order and they're ignoring those.
[02:09:11.193 --> 02:09:16.478]  But you're almost saying more important than regular listeners buying more copies is just do a review.
[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:19.120]  Right, definitely.
[02:09:19.321 --> 02:09:28.385]  Go on to Amazon, go on to BarnesandNoble.com, go on to Target.com and write a review and make sure that it stays there.
[02:09:28.945 --> 02:09:36.728]  And then also write about, like I said, the New York Times, write about these things that are going on and if you see them playing games, write about that.
[02:09:36.928 --> 02:09:41.631]  If you see, if you put a review up and it gets taken down, write about that.
[02:09:41.691 --> 02:09:44.232]  Put it on Instagram, put it on Facebook, put it on Twitter.
[02:09:44.252 --> 02:09:46.913]  They're scared of this book being a rallying point, which it already is.
[02:09:47.413 --> 02:09:51.314]  So let's make it a battle point to get all the sheeple to go read it and find out.
[02:09:51.694 --> 02:09:55.876]  Just like Alexander Shultz and Eachen's Good Luck Repeligo, this is a very important book.
[02:09:55.916 --> 02:09:58.016]  Tony Lyons, thank you for being a visionary.
[02:09:58.056 --> 02:09:59.257]  Thanks for getting me to write the book.
[02:09:59.657 --> 02:10:01.177]  And God bless you, sir.
[02:10:02.338 --> 02:10:02.918]  Thanks so much.
[02:10:04.418 --> 02:10:05.358]  Wow, that was powerful.
[02:10:05.398 --> 02:10:08.359]  I got one more segment I'm going to do with some other news I want to hit.
[02:10:08.399 --> 02:10:10.020]  We're going to come back and cover it.
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:14.298]   But man, The New York Times has never done this before.
[02:10:14.639 --> 02:10:15.599]  They are so scared.
[02:10:16.059 --> 02:10:19.281]  What is it in the Great Reset and the War for the World they don't want you to see?
[02:10:23.383 --> 02:10:26.005]  Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[02:10:26.965 --> 02:10:27.606]  to 3 p.m.
[02:10:27.626 --> 02:10:28.626]  Central, we're live.
[02:10:29.407 --> 02:10:33.269]  And Sunday nights, 4 to 6 p.m., live.
[02:10:33.349 --> 02:10:38.892]  Then Sunday live with Owen Schroyer, Christy Lee, Harrison Smith, and others.
[02:10:40.464 --> 02:10:43.526]  That's coming up here in just a few minutes with your calls and a bunch of other news.
[02:10:47.409 --> 02:10:47.729]  All right.
[02:10:48.149 --> 02:10:49.190]  I meant to play this Friday.
[02:10:49.210 --> 02:10:49.750]  I didn't get to it.
[02:10:49.771 --> 02:10:50.471]  I'm going to play it now.
[02:10:50.631 --> 02:10:51.372]  Alex Stein.
[02:10:51.392 --> 02:10:54.854]  A lot of people were thinking, oh, this guy's just a troll.
[02:10:55.074 --> 02:10:57.236]  Oh, this guy, you know, what's he doing?
[02:10:57.476 --> 02:10:58.437]  He's very smart.
[02:10:59.037 --> 02:11:02.099]  They killed his mother with the COVID hospital garbage.
[02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:09.104]  And I told you, watch this guy carefully because he's the type of people that the bad guys are getting off the bench with their activity.
[02:11:09.853 --> 02:11:15.177]  So he went out and trolled to get a massive following, and now he's showing you the intellectual he is.
[02:11:17.199 --> 02:11:24.704]  And when I'm in Connecticut with the next show trial, not this week, but next week, he'll be hosting one of the shows here, and he'll show you the real Alex Stein.
[02:11:26.365 --> 02:11:31.269]  That's why in his first phase, when he was here months ago, I said, stop it and show me who you really are, because I knew.
[02:11:32.050 --> 02:11:33.871]  He said later, he goes, not yet.
[02:11:34.431 --> 02:11:36.333]  But now he is showing them.
[02:11:37.563 --> 02:11:38.884]  And he's a very smart guy.
[02:11:38.904 --> 02:11:44.228]  And that's what I've been waiting for, is other men and women that have the power to take down the New World Order.
[02:11:44.268 --> 02:11:45.189]  I'm waiting for you.
[02:11:46.410 --> 02:11:47.551]  And I'm starting to see it.
[02:11:47.671 --> 02:11:49.132]  So it's very, very exciting.
[02:11:49.493 --> 02:11:50.393]  We're going to win this, folks.
[02:11:51.094 --> 02:11:55.878]  We already are winning intellectually, but it's going to get a lot rougher before we turn the tide.
[02:11:55.898 --> 02:11:57.199]  That's the way history works.
[02:11:57.259 --> 02:12:02.283]  But here he was last week on Tucker Carlson, laying out the mind control, the trauma-based mind control.
[02:12:05.222 --> 02:12:06.683]  And then, you know, we have to get conspiratorial.
[02:12:06.743 --> 02:12:08.284]  And we look at the Iran-Contra.
[02:12:08.524 --> 02:12:11.866]  The CIA was trading drugs with Nicaraguans for guns.
[02:12:11.886 --> 02:12:18.089]  We were giving them guns, and then they were taking that cocaine, and they were flying it into Mena, Arkansas, which Bill Clinton happened to be the governor of that state.
[02:12:18.349 --> 02:12:22.431]  And they were taking those drugs, and they were putting them in Florida, they were putting them in California, Freeway Ricky Ross.
[02:12:22.672 --> 02:12:24.312]  So they created the crack epidemic.
[02:12:24.332 --> 02:12:28.235]  So the people, the same people that did that, they're creating the problems that we have today.
[02:12:28.555 --> 02:12:30.436]  So it's just a new drug for a new era.
[02:12:32.017 --> 02:12:34.618]  Not really, it's scary.
[02:12:34.718 --> 02:12:36.479]  I know what you mean, I know you just mean that sarcastically.
[02:12:36.499 --> 02:12:49.665]  Yeah, no, but it's just interesting because I mean I grew up in a world where, and speaking for myself, I actually believe that conspiracy theories were the way that dumb, uninformed people explained a complex world.
[02:12:49.945 --> 02:12:50.165]  Yeah.
[02:12:50.325 --> 02:12:55.967]   You couldn't understand what was actually happening, you resorted to a conspiracy theory and that was a mark of A low IQ.
[02:12:56.067 --> 02:12:56.488]  Of course.
[02:12:57.288 --> 02:13:05.573]  Now, I always think this, the more informed, the smarter the person, the more likely they are to be connecting the dots that you're connecting.
[02:13:05.593 --> 02:13:10.776]  So you grew up in a world where people just assumed that the system was not on the level, I think.
[02:13:10.956 --> 02:13:12.418]  Well, it's called cognitive dissonance.
[02:13:12.458 --> 02:13:15.361]  It's like you know the government is, you know, has done corrupt stuff.
[02:13:15.381 --> 02:13:18.304]  You know there's classified levels of intelligence that you'll never be a part of.
[02:13:18.604 --> 02:13:21.127]  But you have cognitive dissonance thinking that the government has your back.
[02:13:21.207 --> 02:13:21.768]  They don't.
[02:13:21.848 --> 02:13:24.671]  It's a personal people control system.
[02:13:24.691 --> 02:13:25.792]  They want to control us.
[02:13:26.093 --> 02:13:29.096]  And that's one of the biggest parts of why they want to keep you depressed.
[02:13:29.136 --> 02:13:32.739]   Because, Tucker, when you're constantly depressed, You're in what is called fight or flight.
[02:13:32.839 --> 02:13:35.301]  So your hormone response is constant cortisol.
[02:13:35.541 --> 02:13:42.326]  And that's why Brian Stelter, those guys that constantly have the ticker on CNN, how many people die, how many people die, because people get addicted to that hormonal response.
[02:13:42.346 --> 02:13:46.929]  And once you're in that fear state of fight or flight, you can't see the forest for the tree right in front of your face.
[02:13:47.469 --> 02:13:51.532]  So then they can literally, like a dog with a treat, they can make you do whatever you want.
[02:13:51.853 --> 02:13:55.075]  And that treat is just more trauma, what I call trauma-based mind control.
[02:13:55.095 --> 02:13:57.377]  Just more fear tactics in order to control you.
[02:13:57.417 --> 02:14:03.402]  So that's what's happening now is the mainstream media, not you, but most of the mainstream media, uses fear to control us.
[02:14:03.422 --> 02:14:05.484]  And that's the same mechanism that the government uses.
[02:14:05.544 --> 02:14:06.565]  I couldn't agree more.
[02:14:07.746 --> 02:14:09.407]  So, three big takeaways from that.
[02:14:12.269 --> 02:14:13.230]  Three big takeaways.
[02:14:13.790 --> 02:14:14.271]  And what are they?
[02:14:15.017 --> 02:14:17.522]  There's even more than that in two minutes, but what are the takeaways?
[02:14:19.045 --> 02:14:20.869]  Become aware of the globalist operations.
[02:14:20.909 --> 02:14:22.212]  Step outside their propaganda.
[02:14:22.713 --> 02:14:23.835]  See how they're controlling you.
[02:14:23.875 --> 02:14:24.877]  Become conscious of it.
[02:14:27.603 --> 02:14:31.844]  And Tucker Carlson, I used to think people that were conspiratorial were wrong.
[02:14:31.884 --> 02:14:36.285]  Now I see that's the real world view to understand this, because that's what we're dealing with.
[02:14:36.705 --> 02:14:40.726]  We don't have altruistic good leaders that want to build a better society for their children and your children.
[02:14:41.006 --> 02:14:41.866]  We have bad people.
[02:14:42.306 --> 02:14:46.007]  During a good cycle, that normally is true, but not during a corrupt cycle.
[02:14:46.227 --> 02:14:47.488]  Was Hitler out for your own good?
[02:14:47.528 --> 02:14:48.128]  Was Stalin?
[02:14:48.628 --> 02:14:49.188]  Was Mao?
[02:14:50.388 --> 02:14:51.208]  Was Genghis Khan?
[02:14:51.248 --> 02:14:51.488]  No.
[02:14:52.369 --> 02:14:53.489]  So stop being a chump.
[02:14:53.489 --> 02:15:06.449]   And so those are two of the big takeaways, but what's the third takeaway?
[02:15:06.638 --> 02:15:08.719]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[02:15:10.000 --> 02:15:19.306]  And what Alex Stein has done, going out and trolling them and doing all this, to build up a big audience and then attack them with intellectual information, that's what I did.
[02:15:19.907 --> 02:15:25.511]  And I really wasn't conscious about it the first 10 years, but only 28, 29 years, but now that's where we are.
[02:15:26.351 --> 02:15:36.744]   And I'm like a man that's been out in the ocean Thrown off of ship for a day, swimming for his life, finally finding an island to rest, because that's what I love seeing.
[02:15:38.845 --> 02:15:48.508]  Is the Joe Rogans, the Tucker Carlsons, and the Alex Steins waking up and getting hardcore and realizing that the tyranny's real, because that's when our real mission has been complete.
[02:15:48.828 --> 02:15:51.809]  We are the men and women in the arena.
[02:15:53.269 --> 02:16:01.848]   Now I'm coming in tomorrow, through the first hour, and then we're gonna have Andrew Tate, the biggest loser of the interview, and more after that.
[02:16:02.248 --> 02:16:19.460]  I'm gonna fly up to Dallas on my buddy's helicopter tomorrow at noon so I can get to the studios of Steve Crowder and do his huge show.
[02:16:21.001 --> 02:16:21.962]  I'll be back in the evening.
[02:16:22.903 --> 02:16:24.224]  But tomorrow's gonna be a big show.
[02:16:25.284 --> 02:16:31.287]   But tomorrow, In the first hour, I'm going to hit the news I didn't get to, and all the other breaking news, like this.
[02:16:32.168 --> 02:16:34.270]  Boy, this story on the London Guardian says it all, doesn't it?
[02:16:35.692 --> 02:16:38.915]  Guns brought through credit cards, and the U.S.
[02:16:38.955 --> 02:16:39.896]  will now be trackable.
[02:16:42.338 --> 02:16:45.081]  You're already giving info to the ATF.
[02:16:45.101 --> 02:16:46.322]  You're already going through a background check.
[02:16:48.044 --> 02:16:52.745]  Why will they then, they say at all gun shops and all sporting goods stores, be put in a database?
[02:16:52.765 --> 02:16:55.386]  Because they're going to use that database against you outside of law.
[02:16:55.686 --> 02:16:56.967]  That's corporate governance.
[02:16:58.207 --> 02:16:59.767]  That's the universal credit score.
[02:17:01.968 --> 02:17:03.408]  That's the social credit score.
[02:17:04.669 --> 02:17:07.770]  That's their plan, and that's so damn illegal.
[02:17:07.810 --> 02:17:11.651]  And the governors and Congress and others should be acting, and they will.
[02:17:11.991 --> 02:17:16.572]  But this is the enemy making their move, and tomorrow we'll be covering it.
[02:17:18.188 --> 02:17:19.388]  This story out of MSN.
[02:17:20.368 --> 02:17:23.069]  This robot catches grandma before she falls.
[02:17:23.409 --> 02:17:26.850]  So a robot follows grandma around to make sure she doesn't fall.
[02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:28.130]  It surveils grandma.
[02:17:28.470 --> 02:17:29.450]  It watches grandma.
[02:17:29.770 --> 02:17:30.830]  It controls grandma.
[02:17:31.910 --> 02:17:33.251]  It's the AI takeover.
[02:17:34.031 --> 02:17:34.971]  You see that right there.
[02:17:34.991 --> 02:17:40.072]  That's the next level of the home assistant.
[02:17:40.252 --> 02:17:42.052]  1,100 plus athletes die from sudden death.
[02:17:45.113 --> 02:17:46.913]  The majority just in the last year and a half.
[02:17:49.591 --> 02:17:50.352]  And some good news.
[02:17:50.392 --> 02:18:00.480]  I meant to get to this, but judge tells White House to turn over emails from KJP, Fauci, to social media platforms where they've been directing censorship.
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:04.403]  Yeah, you can censor if you want as a platform, but not in coordination with the government.
[02:18:04.743 --> 02:18:05.384]  That's illegal.
[02:18:05.664 --> 02:18:08.186]  We'll be talking about this and this big clip tomorrow.
[02:18:08.807 --> 02:18:11.249]  Senator Hawley puts entire Biden regime on notice.
[02:18:12.049 --> 02:18:16.831]  An army of whistleblowers has produced evidence that exposes their entire program.
[02:18:17.071 --> 02:18:21.972]  And I've got the articles here where they call it sleeper cells with Project Veritas.
[02:18:22.732 --> 02:18:26.513]  How they see themselves as agents working against the American people.
[02:18:28.094 --> 02:18:30.214]  We need more Josh Hawleys.
[02:18:30.375 --> 02:18:31.515]  We need more.
[02:18:32.775 --> 02:18:35.316]  Like the new conservative leader who's got the votes to beat Trudeau.
[02:18:36.456 --> 02:18:38.377]  Up in Canada, Pierre Olivier.
[02:18:39.943 --> 02:18:41.409]  But I'll say this very briefly.
[02:18:42.132 --> 02:18:43.016]  This is a fundraiser.
[02:18:43.036 --> 02:18:45.225]  This is how we stay on air.
[02:18:47.918 --> 02:18:49.079]  It's on a Founder Coin.
[02:18:49.139 --> 02:18:50.700]  The first three coins were Founder Coins.
[02:18:51.100 --> 02:18:56.524]  And all Founders are getting special access and benefits that only they get via their email that I'm not going to talk about on air.
[02:18:56.864 --> 02:18:57.685]  It's inside baseball.
[02:18:57.705 --> 02:18:58.545]  It's Fight Club stuff.
[02:18:59.006 --> 02:19:03.409]  But this is the fourth coin that is a fundraiser coin that is a piece of history.
[02:19:03.649 --> 02:19:06.050]  And there's only 10,000 of these that we need to stay on air.
[02:19:06.351 --> 02:19:07.111]  Plus, it's amazing.
[02:19:07.391 --> 02:19:10.153]  The Man in the Arena Teddy Roosevelt Coin.
[02:19:10.694 --> 02:19:13.015]  Teddy Roosevelt on the front, on the back, a gladiator.
[02:19:13.656 --> 02:19:14.536]  The Man in the Arena.
[02:19:15.717 --> 02:19:17.078]  What an incredible piece of history.
[02:19:18.166 --> 02:19:19.187]  What a collector's item.
[02:19:19.507 --> 02:19:23.371]  Many of the previous coins are selling for three, four times what we sold them for.
[02:19:24.332 --> 02:19:31.599]  It is pure 999 silver, silver round, Citizen of the Republic, Man in the Arena coin.
[02:19:33.461 --> 02:19:38.425]  And the markup you see on them is to keep us on the air and launch special projects.
[02:19:38.886 --> 02:19:40.287]  So thank you all for your support.
[02:19:42.169 --> 02:19:46.895]   All three of the other coins Kept us on air.
[02:19:47.515 --> 02:19:49.456]  This coin will take us to the next level.
[02:19:49.776 --> 02:20:01.020]  And even though folks that bought the first three coins get exclusive content and special deals on other products and so much more that pay you back within a month for what you did.
[02:20:01.340 --> 02:20:07.022]  Those emails have already gone out where folks that are founding members get this coin for like $39 less than retail.
[02:20:07.042 --> 02:20:10.483]  We're going to have subscription services that are free to you.
[02:20:10.864 --> 02:20:12.804]  We're going to have films.
[02:20:12.844 --> 02:20:13.985]  You get everything.
[02:20:14.085 --> 02:20:15.005]  This is so important.
[02:20:16.511 --> 02:20:26.957]  So, even though it's on a founding member coin, we're going to give founding member benefits to everybody that gets the Teddy Roosevelt Man in the Arena coin at 1776coin.com.
[02:20:27.537 --> 02:20:30.959]  It's not available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:20:32.000 --> 02:20:33.821]  It's exclusively available at 171776, 1776coin.com.
[02:20:38.760 --> 02:20:40.721]  That takes you to PatriotCollectibles.com.

[02:20:46.906 --> 02:20:47.986]  Keep us on air in the fight.
[02:20:48.427 --> 02:20:49.747]  Get your Teddy Roosevelt coin.

[02:20:53.390 --> 02:20:54.291]  These will sell out quick.
[02:20:54.130 --> 02:20:55.130]  Thank you.
[02:20:55.130 --> 02:21:03.130]  [Music]
[02:21:03.130 --> 02:21:07.130]  People ask me all the time, "What is your best nootropic?"
[02:21:07.221 --> 02:21:12.411]  You've got TurboForce, you've got BrainForce Plus, and you've got BrainForce Ultra.
[02:21:12.852 --> 02:21:13.633]  Which one is better?
[02:21:14.495 --> 02:21:22.426]   And that's like asking What's better, a Ford F-150, or a Cadillac, or a Ferrari?
[02:21:23.367 --> 02:21:25.249]  It's different strokes for different folks.
[02:21:25.409 --> 02:21:26.470]  It varies.
[02:21:26.891 --> 02:21:27.992]  All three are different formulas.
[02:21:28.813 --> 02:21:29.974]  All three do different things.
[02:21:30.575 --> 02:21:34.619]  Turbo Force is ten hours of clean, out-of-control energy.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:36.381]  I can't even take a whole pack myself.
[02:21:37.142 --> 02:21:40.785]  BrainForce Plus is a long-term acting clean nootropic.
[02:21:41.445 --> 02:21:49.831]  This BrainForce Ultra is a super fast acting nootropic that creates incredible clarity but doesn't last very long.
[02:21:50.171 --> 02:21:51.812]  They're all three different formulas.
[02:21:52.133 --> 02:21:59.058]  And finally, back in stock, massively discounted, BrainForce Ultra is available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:21:59.398 --> 02:22:02.200]  BrainForce Ultra, back in stock, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:22:03.921 --> 02:22:04.702]  Hello, hello, hello.
[02:22:04.762 --> 02:22:06.563]  Great to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:08.240 --> 02:22:09.561]  We're trend forecasters.
[02:22:09.921 --> 02:22:12.623]  We put out a magazine each week, the Trends Journal.
[02:22:13.623 --> 02:22:17.285]  You know, it has averages over 150 pages a week.
[02:22:18.086 --> 02:22:21.908]  We tell you what you need to know, what you need to do.
[02:22:22.608 --> 02:22:24.169]  We give you history before it happens.
[02:22:26.431 --> 02:22:31.874]  All the news for the last few days, the Queen is dead.
[02:22:33.495 --> 02:22:34.395]  The Queen is dead, 96 years old.
[02:22:38.749 --> 02:22:43.893]  Nobility is ungodly.
[02:22:45.474 --> 02:22:47.795]  What, does she count more than my mother dying?
[02:22:47.815 --> 02:22:48.956]  May she rest in peace?
[02:22:48.976 --> 02:22:50.557]  She's only 59.
[02:22:51.257 --> 02:22:54.400]  Or my father when he was 71.
[02:22:54.480 --> 02:22:55.881]  No, they don't count!
[02:22:56.801 --> 02:22:59.543]  They're just plantation workers of Slavelandia!
[02:22:59.863 --> 02:23:01.404]  They're not nobility!
[02:23:01.424 --> 02:23:06.828]  And this guy all dressed up in his, all his costume drag.
[02:23:08.447 --> 02:23:13.208]  All the medals and the... What is it, Halloween?
[02:23:14.108 --> 02:23:15.788]  With his costumes on?
[02:23:18.449 --> 02:23:23.610]  The reason they do this is to make all of us look worthless.
[02:23:24.690 --> 02:23:25.830]  Nobility!
[02:23:26.511 --> 02:23:29.631]  We don't pee and we don't poo.
[02:23:30.451 --> 02:23:33.772]  We are so much better than you.
[02:23:36.607 --> 02:23:38.688]  What a bunch of crap!
[02:23:40.129 --> 02:23:42.271]  What a bunch of crap!
[02:23:45.233 --> 02:23:58.021]  The reason they do this is you start with the nobility and don't forget to roll out the red carpet and dress all those little clowns up in their drag so they can salute.
[02:23:59.862 --> 02:24:02.924]  And when you see the Pope, don't forget to kiss his ring.
[02:24:03.405 --> 02:24:03.705]  Yeah.
[02:24:04.474 --> 02:24:06.354]  You'd better not bend over, you know.
[02:24:06.414 --> 02:24:08.375]  Hey, that may be another thing.
[02:24:08.695 --> 02:24:10.315]  But that's another story.
[02:24:12.096 --> 02:24:16.536]  They do this nobility crap because here's the way it goes.
[02:24:18.397 --> 02:24:35.653]   It goes from nobility, to Prime Minister, to Chancellor, to President, to Senator, To congressmen?
[02:24:37.314 --> 02:24:38.014]  To governor?
[02:24:39.114 --> 02:24:39.694]  To mayor?
[02:24:40.114 --> 02:24:41.815]  Don't forget to take orders!
[02:24:42.375 --> 02:24:44.076]  Don't forget to take orders!
[02:24:45.656 --> 02:24:47.597]  They are the dignitaries!
[02:24:47.937 --> 02:24:49.517]  Those little clowns!
[02:24:49.817 --> 02:24:51.858]  Those little pieces of lemon!
[02:24:52.318 --> 02:24:56.939]  Or a daddy's girl, mommy's girl, Anderson Cooper!
[02:24:57.479 --> 02:24:58.339]  Yeah, yeah!
[02:24:58.720 --> 02:25:01.440]  How they pump up these little clowns!
[02:25:02.361 --> 02:25:03.941]  How they pump them all up!
[02:25:04.594 --> 02:25:18.261]  The prostitutes and tell us that we have to listen to authorities and that if we don't listen to authorities, because they come from the noble down, you know, what authority?
[02:25:18.542 --> 02:25:19.002]  Shove it.
[02:25:20.002 --> 02:25:21.143]  Oh, I'm an authority.
[02:25:21.503 --> 02:25:23.364]  I'm fraud Fauci.
[02:25:24.905 --> 02:25:27.046]  Hey, don't forget to get that shot.
[02:25:27.066 --> 02:25:29.568]  95% efficacy rate.
[02:25:29.968 --> 02:25:32.229]  Oh, well, well, the variant changed.
[02:25:32.816 --> 02:25:34.538]  Yeah, what'd you make, $52 billion?
[02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:51.613]  This whole nobility thing is a whole thing to keep the people taking orders from the little low-life pieces of scum crap, political sh... Can't say the word.
[02:25:53.375 --> 02:25:54.296]  Authorities.
[02:25:55.237 --> 02:25:56.278]  Dignitaries.
[02:25:59.045 --> 02:26:01.846]  Well, they should have held this event at Disney World!
[02:26:01.966 --> 02:26:03.566]  It would have been great!
[02:26:04.466 --> 02:26:04.746]  Yeah.
[02:26:05.685 --> 02:26:07.685]  You think I'm kidding?
[02:26:07.685 --> 02:26:16.409]   We're gonna be back in a little bit And I'm gonna show you that I'm not kidding.
[02:26:17.529 --> 02:26:18.549]  You see the headlines.
[02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:21.310]  Queen and Spirit of Britain.
[02:26:21.970 --> 02:26:23.990]  All the rest of you people got no spirit.
[02:26:24.890 --> 02:26:25.951]  Only Queenie does.
[02:26:26.671 --> 02:26:27.811]  Here's the Wall Street Journal.
[02:26:29.309 --> 02:26:32.250]  We'll be back in a few and I got a big announcement to make.
[02:26:33.351 --> 02:26:33.831]  Stay tuned.
[02:26:34.812 --> 02:26:35.792]  Hey, hey, hey!
[02:26:36.132 --> 02:26:37.993]  So anyway, these are all the headlines, yeah.
[02:26:39.874 --> 02:26:40.795]  Financial Times.
[02:26:43.536 --> 02:26:43.956]  Look at this.
[02:26:45.176 --> 02:26:47.176]  Financial Times.
[02:26:47.176 --> 02:26:53.176]  Yep.
[02:26:53.101 --> 02:26:54.041]  What's this thing cost me?
[02:26:54.061 --> 02:26:54.041]  $250.
[02:26:54.101 --> 02:26:54.561]  For this.
[02:26:54.661 --> 02:26:55.762]  Yeah.
[02:26:59.175 --> 02:27:03.217]  My whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service.
[02:27:03.237 --> 02:27:03.457]  Yeah.
[02:27:03.717 --> 02:27:04.257]  Well, they worked.
[02:27:04.277 --> 02:27:05.098]  How many billions?
[02:27:06.098 --> 02:27:06.818]  My service.
[02:27:08.479 --> 02:27:22.445]  Well, again, the importance about this is that by holding up nobility and making them better than us, it keeps working down the system.
[02:27:23.584 --> 02:27:39.015]  Every time the clown presidents, the prime ministers, the chancellors, anytime they go anywhere, all these guys and girls dressed up in their perfect military drag saluting.
[02:27:40.736 --> 02:27:41.817]  And the red carpet.
[02:27:42.277 --> 02:27:43.218]  The red carpet.
[02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:47.321]  Yeah.
[02:27:48.802 --> 02:27:49.162]  Look at us.
[02:27:53.806 --> 02:27:54.567]  Nobility.
[02:27:55.067 --> 02:27:55.547]  Saving.
[02:27:56.968 --> 02:27:59.049]  Queen and Spirit of Britain.
[02:27:59.830 --> 02:28:01.031]  Yeah, I buy these papers.
[02:28:01.051 --> 02:28:04.653]  They cost $3, $5 for the Wall Street Journal.
[02:28:04.693 --> 02:28:05.853]  And this is the stuff I hear.
[02:28:07.414 --> 02:28:10.256]  But we're giving you in the Trends Journal everything you need to know.
[02:28:10.276 --> 02:28:11.637]  And we've gone the need-to-know end.
[02:28:12.918 --> 02:28:14.699]  We've got this Ukraine war going on.
[02:28:16.620 --> 02:28:19.382]  And it's only going to keep ramping up.
[02:28:20.169 --> 02:28:28.056]  Oh, by the way, over there in the UK, and you might as well put an F and a U and throw a couple another letter in there, too.
[02:28:29.097 --> 02:28:29.377]  Yeah.
[02:28:31.219 --> 02:28:36.644]  The guy, the clown, the new clown playing Prime Minister trusts.
[02:28:36.984 --> 02:28:39.066]  Yeah, if you trust so, you're out of your mind.
[02:28:41.966 --> 02:28:43.087]  We're going to keep fighting.
[02:28:43.107 --> 02:28:45.969]  We're going to keep fighting until Russia loses.
[02:28:46.630 --> 02:28:49.992]  Oh, yeah, the wonderful colonists, UK.
[02:28:50.653 --> 02:28:53.615]  Yeah, the sun never sets on the British Empire.
[02:28:53.635 --> 02:28:59.339]  Oh, hey, all you people in India must love them for the hundreds of years that they controlled you.
[02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:06.187]   Following in the footsteps of the little clown before her, Boris Johnson.
[02:29:06.667 --> 02:29:08.288]  One idiot after another.
[02:29:08.648 --> 02:29:11.510]  These are the authorities that we have to look up to.
[02:29:11.871 --> 02:29:15.773]  This is the clown lady that we wrote in the Trends Journal.
[02:29:16.293 --> 02:29:23.878]  She said, was asked, you know, must be terrible if you had to press that nuclear button to fight Russia.
[02:29:26.280 --> 02:29:27.721]  And she said, I'd do it.
[02:29:28.587 --> 02:29:29.488]  I press the button?
[02:29:29.768 --> 02:29:30.689]  Oh, you press the button.
[02:29:30.709 --> 02:29:31.249]  I don't count?
[02:29:31.289 --> 02:29:32.190]  Of course you don't count!
[02:29:32.610 --> 02:29:35.913]  All you billions of people out there, you count for nothing!
[02:29:36.533 --> 02:29:40.837]  You're nothing but servants on the plantation of Slavelandia!
[02:29:41.237 --> 02:29:42.738]  I'll tell you what to do!
[02:29:43.639 --> 02:29:45.100]  I'll tell you what to do!
[02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:46.901]  You don't know crap!
[02:29:47.522 --> 02:29:49.183]  I know everything!
[02:29:49.824 --> 02:29:53.787]  I'm a little clown playing your politician!
[02:29:55.074 --> 02:29:56.215]  Bow to the Queen!
[02:29:56.615 --> 02:29:58.816]  Kiss the Pri- The Pope's ring!
[02:29:59.256 --> 02:29:59.536]  Yep!
[02:30:00.777 --> 02:30:01.597]  Bend over!
[02:30:02.797 --> 02:30:03.258]  Take it!
[02:30:05.899 --> 02:30:07.019]  What a joke.
[02:30:07.940 --> 02:30:08.820]  Yeah, she died.
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:09.660]  So what?
[02:30:11.741 --> 02:30:12.442]  So what?
[02:30:16.243 --> 02:30:17.364]  What's the big deal?
[02:30:18.304 --> 02:30:19.185]  Oh, nobility.
[02:30:19.425 --> 02:30:20.065]  I forgot.
[02:30:21.283 --> 02:30:26.126]  The God, you know, I started the Universal Church of Freedom, Peace, and Justice.
[02:30:26.627 --> 02:30:27.467]  Freedom, get it?
[02:30:27.968 --> 02:30:28.928]  I'm an American!
[02:30:30.089 --> 02:30:30.910]  I'm an American!
[02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:36.714]  The Founding Fathers shove your kingship up your you-know-what!
[02:30:38.195 --> 02:30:44.459]  Hey, read the Declaration of Independence or maybe you're too damn stupid to do so!
[02:30:44.378 --> 02:30:47.338]  But of course not the people listening to InfoWars.
[02:30:47.338 --> 02:31:00.698]   We endowed by our Creator with the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,
[02:31:00.698 --> 02:31:04.057]  in that all men are created equal.
[02:31:04.544 --> 02:31:05.465]  You got it?
[02:31:06.205 --> 02:31:07.085]  You got it?
[02:31:07.846 --> 02:31:08.586]  Oh, but women.
[02:31:08.646 --> 02:31:09.306]  I forgot women.
[02:31:09.546 --> 02:31:11.867]  And now you got Clown Prince over there.
[02:31:12.187 --> 02:31:14.088]  The Charlie boy coming to king.
[02:31:14.368 --> 02:31:15.168]  Here comes the king.
[02:31:15.208 --> 02:31:15.648]  Here, king.
[02:31:15.668 --> 02:31:16.068]  Here, boy.
[02:31:16.429 --> 02:31:16.709]  Come on.
[02:31:16.749 --> 02:31:17.149]  Here, king.
[02:31:17.589 --> 02:31:17.889]  Sit.
[02:31:18.369 --> 02:31:19.050]  Give me a paw.
[02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:20.050]  Down.
[02:31:20.896 --> 02:31:21.536]  Roll over!
[02:31:21.996 --> 02:31:22.696]  Hey, King!
[02:31:23.317 --> 02:31:24.077]  What, King?
[02:31:24.997 --> 02:31:25.937]  Maybe Kingfish.
[02:31:26.737 --> 02:31:28.138]  Oh, can't say Kingfish anymore.
[02:31:28.158 --> 02:31:28.878]  Hey, Mr. Nandy.
[02:31:29.398 --> 02:31:30.478]  Oh, hey there, Kingfish.
[02:31:32.479 --> 02:31:32.699]  Yep.
[02:31:33.579 --> 02:31:35.319]  You wonder why Diana left you.
[02:31:36.200 --> 02:31:37.300]  Yeah, Diana left you.
[02:31:37.340 --> 02:31:38.340]  Now you're running the place.
[02:31:38.700 --> 02:31:42.101]  By the way, she had a 1994 Audi Cabriolet.
[02:31:42.821 --> 02:31:43.882]  British Racing Green.
[02:31:44.302 --> 02:31:45.282]  I got the same one.
[02:31:46.545 --> 02:31:53.011]  No, no, me and the prince is, uh... Eh, we were, maybe we were in it, but I can't talk about it, you know.
[02:31:53.711 --> 02:31:55.153]  That's a joke, man.
[02:31:55.693 --> 02:31:59.716]  The billions, millions, hundreds of millions of dollars this thing's costing.
[02:32:00.117 --> 02:32:01.738]  And don't forget to be silent!
[02:32:02.559 --> 02:32:02.779]  Yo.
[02:32:05.862 --> 02:32:06.703]  How about peace?
[02:32:08.144 --> 02:32:10.866]  Hey, where were you talking about peace?
[02:32:12.007 --> 02:32:12.327]  King?
[02:32:12.347 --> 02:32:13.869]  Yeah, King?
[02:32:16.075 --> 02:32:16.875]  Hey boy, come on!
[02:32:18.496 --> 02:32:19.176]  There we go.
[02:32:20.056 --> 02:32:20.616]  The king.
[02:32:22.656 --> 02:32:22.956]  Yeah.
[02:32:23.937 --> 02:32:26.777]  Again, this is Disney World in front of our eyes.
[02:32:29.238 --> 02:32:34.799]  Again, they do this so that the leaders are in control.
[02:32:35.319 --> 02:32:36.559]  End of story.
[02:32:36.999 --> 02:32:38.240]  And it's up and down the line.
[02:32:38.480 --> 02:32:40.220]  The Federal Reserve.
[02:32:40.460 --> 02:32:41.860]  What Federal Reserve?
[02:32:42.180 --> 02:32:44.301]  A bunch of bangsta gangstas!
[02:32:46.260 --> 02:32:48.341]  Federal Reserve, they're federal or nothing!
[02:32:50.903 --> 02:32:52.283]  But this is what they do to us.
[02:32:54.124 --> 02:32:57.846]  And when I come back, by the way, we're going to take a break in a few minutes.
[02:32:58.187 --> 02:33:00.088]  I got a big, big announcement to make.
[02:33:00.648 --> 02:33:13.435]  I had one of the most wonderful, it'll be one of the most memorable, memorable, memorable days of my life that I'll never forget.
[02:33:14.767 --> 02:33:18.209]  And I've been with presidents, prime ministers, and princes.
[02:33:19.609 --> 02:33:33.656]  Got a picture of me and Ronald Reagan over there when I picked him up at the Chicago Hilton when I was 30 years old and put on a brunch for him with our board of directors.
[02:33:35.657 --> 02:33:41.100]  Put on a concert with Ella Fitzgerald, one with Dionne Warwick.
[02:33:41.775 --> 02:33:45.056]  The Superdome, back in the days when I used to work in the corporate world.
[02:33:47.097 --> 02:33:52.500]  But on Saturday, I met a man of great admiration.
[02:33:54.761 --> 02:33:55.581]  We got together.
[02:33:55.601 --> 02:33:57.682]  I want to talk about some things.
[02:33:58.723 --> 02:33:59.723]  Van Morrison.
[02:34:01.064 --> 02:34:01.484]  That's right.
[02:34:01.504 --> 02:34:06.266]  He was playing at the Forest Hill Stadium this past weekend.
[02:34:09.227 --> 02:34:10.528]  And the stadium was packed.
[02:34:11.573 --> 02:34:12.834]  Tom Jones let it off.
[02:34:14.694 --> 02:34:16.235]  And what a show these people put on.
[02:34:18.756 --> 02:34:19.236]  Here we are.
[02:34:20.777 --> 02:34:21.637]  John Plotania.
[02:34:24.199 --> 02:34:25.279]  Van Morrison and me.
[02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:27.400]  What a show.
[02:34:27.700 --> 02:34:29.421]  That guy John is a guitarist.
[02:34:30.121 --> 02:34:31.762]  Played non-stop, non-stop.
[02:34:31.782 --> 02:34:33.683]  And these aren't young cats, you know.
[02:34:35.524 --> 02:34:36.604]  We're all not young cats.
[02:34:36.724 --> 02:34:38.445]  They played non-stop for the people.
[02:34:40.666 --> 02:34:54.344]   And He wanted to meet me, but ironically, he didn't know about a piece that I wrote back in two years ago, in September of 2020.
[02:34:54.464 --> 02:34:58.785]  When I come back, I'm going to talk more about it.
[02:35:01.126 --> 02:35:08.387]  But these people, these performers, what they give the people, it ain't one bad rap man.
[02:35:08.407 --> 02:35:12.448]  This guy playing harmonica, picking up a saxophone.
[02:35:13.351 --> 02:35:16.533]  John playing non-stop, man.
[02:35:16.593 --> 02:35:18.233]  Hour and 45 minutes, almost two hours.
[02:35:20.315 --> 02:35:33.721]  They're giving the people what they need, but they've gone after Van Morrison because he's a man of the truth, a man of freedom, and a man of peace.
[02:35:33.741 --> 02:35:37.103]  And when I get back, I'm going to tell you more about it.
[02:35:38.183 --> 02:35:48.069]   What our meeting was about, the time we spent And again, it was a real honor to be there.
[02:35:49.810 --> 02:35:50.830]  And we must unite.
[02:35:52.171 --> 02:36:00.115]  And again, when we come back, I'm going to show you what we wrote two years ago, and how we could turn this around.
[02:36:02.737 --> 02:36:06.038]  Because if we don't turn it around, we're going down.
[02:36:07.119 --> 02:36:08.059]  It's a freak show.
[02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:09.780]  And they're in charge.
[02:36:10.101 --> 02:36:10.801]  We'll be right back.
[02:36:12.111 --> 02:36:14.052]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:14.712 --> 02:36:24.176]  And remember, do all you can to support InfoWars because it's censorship 2.0, something we warned about years and years ago, that would happen.
[02:36:24.776 --> 02:36:26.397]  And now that's the way it is.
[02:36:27.457 --> 02:36:29.598]  And it's only going to get worse.
[02:36:30.899 --> 02:36:34.120]  Again, I mentioned about meeting Van Morrison, he wanted to meet me.
[02:36:35.155 --> 02:36:39.799]  And he didn't know that I wrote this in the Trends Journal, although I guess it's the Trends Journal now.
[02:36:39.839 --> 02:36:42.821]  And by the way, if you want to know what's going on, you need the Trends Journal.
[02:36:43.482 --> 02:36:45.684]  But the way he knows me is through InfoWars.
[02:36:46.584 --> 02:36:47.025]  Here we are.
[02:36:47.045 --> 02:36:55.512]  There's John Pattania, Dan Morrison, and me on Saturday.
[02:36:56.192 --> 02:36:56.893]  Forest Hills.
[02:36:57.533 --> 02:36:58.614]  Great place, by the way.
[02:36:59.335 --> 02:37:00.856]  The old-time joint, you know?
[02:37:02.137 --> 02:37:03.278]  And everybody was so nice.
[02:37:04.199 --> 02:37:04.499]  Anyway.
[02:37:05.305 --> 02:37:21.130]  Back in September of 2020, two years ago, two years ago, September 22nd, we wrote, back in March when New York State was locked down by Governor Andrew Cuomo, this is from the Trends Journal.
[02:37:22.551 --> 02:37:23.491]  We wrote this article.
[02:37:25.112 --> 02:37:29.333]  Gerald Cilenti was inspired to write two anti-lockdown songs.
[02:37:29.913 --> 02:37:30.954]  Here's some of the lyrics.
[02:37:31.914 --> 02:37:34.615]  The first one was, How Am I Gonna?
[02:37:35.831 --> 02:37:37.032]  How am I going to pay my rent?
[02:37:37.332 --> 02:37:38.473]  How am I going to cut your hair?
[02:37:38.493 --> 02:37:41.875]  How am I going to serve your food when they won't allow you?
[02:37:42.755 --> 02:37:45.397]  The other one, this is just some of the lyrics in the beginning of the song.
[02:37:45.417 --> 02:37:47.658]  The other one is, don't mask it, don't mask me.
[02:37:49.339 --> 02:37:51.161]  Don't mask me, I'm born to be free.
[02:37:51.221 --> 02:37:53.322]  Not a coward, not a thief, nothing to hide.
[02:37:53.362 --> 02:37:54.923]  You can see me, don't mask me.
[02:37:56.064 --> 02:38:04.389]  Slenty had someone to put the band together to begin producing the songs, but the lockdowns made it impossible to rent a studio, etc.
[02:38:07.827 --> 02:38:09.347]  Van Morrison to the rescue.
[02:38:09.448 --> 02:38:10.508]  That's the breakout point.
[02:38:10.948 --> 02:38:15.930]  And now, as reported by BBC, Van Morrison, the famed singer behind Brown Eyed Girl.
[02:38:16.990 --> 02:38:17.890]  And boy, he did that.
[02:38:18.610 --> 02:38:19.971]  Van, I'm telling you, phenomenal.
[02:38:20.971 --> 02:38:21.471]  Phenomenal.
[02:38:22.432 --> 02:38:24.292]  And again, all the musicians, man.
[02:38:24.372 --> 02:38:25.673]  These cats played.
[02:38:25.993 --> 02:38:27.373]  Not one bad rep.
[02:38:31.935 --> 02:38:32.715]  No, it wasn't that.
[02:38:32.735 --> 02:38:33.715]  It was real music.
[02:38:34.075 --> 02:38:34.936]  And how they did it.
[02:38:36.178 --> 02:38:37.279]  Their rage kept going on.
[02:38:37.299 --> 02:38:47.126]  But anyway, Brown Eyed Girl has gone back into the studio to accuse British government of enslaving the population with its strict coronavirus mandates.
[02:38:48.167 --> 02:38:53.010]  Calling the UK government, quote, fascist bullies disturbing our peace, end quote.
[02:38:53.731 --> 02:39:05.179]  The BBC reported Morrison wrote three new songs that include the lyric, no more taking of our freedom and our God given rights, pretending it's only for our safety.
[02:39:05.796 --> 02:39:07.116]  When it's really to enslave.
[02:39:08.777 --> 02:39:08.957]  Yep.
[02:39:10.778 --> 02:39:10.978]  So.
[02:39:12.038 --> 02:39:18.040]  Calling out the cast of quote celebrities telling us what they're supposed to feel end quote.
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:24.602]  Morrison said they are being used as mouthpieces for the government to sell the people what they are peddling.
[02:39:25.542 --> 02:39:34.425]  He said it is becoming rare nowadays to find an artist who is not afraid to speak out against what is high being widely accepted as groupthink.
[02:39:36.096 --> 02:39:37.096]  Yep.
[02:39:37.096 --> 02:39:46.976]   In tune with what Gero Salanti and the Trends Journal have been advising for decades, think
[02:39:46.976 --> 02:39:52.217]   for yourself, Morrison said his songs are not about quote "telling people what to do
[02:39:52.217 --> 02:39:53.217]  or think."
[02:39:53.953 --> 02:39:55.734]  It's about freedom of choice.
[02:39:57.036 --> 02:39:59.498]  People have the right to think for themselves.
[02:40:02.588 --> 02:40:13.476]  The Irish Post ran an article that called on a legendary singer to be stripped of the Freedom of Belfast award he had been given due to his new songs.
[02:40:14.717 --> 02:40:15.538]  Can you imagine that?
[02:40:17.559 --> 02:40:17.780]  Yep.
[02:40:20.001 --> 02:40:25.846]  He's stripped of an award he got because he told people to be free.
[02:40:27.299 --> 02:40:35.661]  Emmett McDonough Brown, a Belfast City Councilor, said Morrison received the honor in 2013 and is the highest honor the city bestows.
[02:40:36.982 --> 02:40:38.242]  Again, remember, I wrote this in 2000.
[02:40:38.482 --> 02:40:42.403]  This is written in the Trends Journal two years ago.
[02:40:43.884 --> 02:40:54.607]  Quote, his most recent lyrics undermine the guidance in place to protect lives and are ignorant of established science as we grapple with COVID-19.
[02:40:55.888 --> 02:40:59.749]  So I've asked the City Council to consider revoking it.
[02:41:01.269 --> 02:41:02.889]  Okay, clown lady!
[02:41:02.909 --> 02:41:05.310]  Hey, little clown lady!
[02:41:05.330 --> 02:41:06.670]  Oh, what is she?
[02:41:07.410 --> 02:41:09.110]  Oh, City Councilor!
[02:41:09.690 --> 02:41:11.991]  City piece of crapster!
[02:41:12.471 --> 02:41:13.731]  Hey, dumbbell!
[02:41:14.471 --> 02:41:23.693]  All the jerks that you played with that robbed us of our freedom, none of your crap worked!
[02:41:24.389 --> 02:41:30.412]  And as you go to InfoWars, today they got a whole list of them on there, of all the failures that have happened.
[02:41:31.053 --> 02:41:33.874]  With the vaccines and all the other made-up crap!
[02:41:34.354 --> 02:41:37.236]  Not science, dumbbell!
[02:41:37.696 --> 02:41:39.337]  Political science!
[02:41:39.737 --> 02:41:41.698]  You political piece of crap!
[02:41:41.918 --> 02:41:42.819]  Oh, a dignitary!
[02:41:42.839 --> 02:41:46.661]  Oh, I may go for the city council and then work my way up!
[02:41:46.981 --> 02:41:49.382]  And then you have to roll out the red carpet!
[02:41:49.402 --> 02:41:52.024]  Alright?
[02:41:54.653 --> 02:42:02.838]  Hermit Diblin, an influential California Republican lawyer tweeted, Is it possible to love Van Morrison more?
[02:42:03.458 --> 02:42:05.340]  I don't know right now!
[02:42:06.120 --> 02:42:09.142]  An influential piece of garbage!
[02:42:09.702 --> 02:42:11.684]  Influential to who?
[02:42:12.584 --> 02:42:14.946]  This is propaganda!
[02:42:15.346 --> 02:42:16.727]  Influential!
[02:42:18.188 --> 02:42:19.949]  You're a bunch of jerks!
[02:42:20.009 --> 02:42:21.790]  You're destroying the world!
[02:42:22.870 --> 02:42:25.211]  You suck the joy and beauty out of life!
[02:42:26.231 --> 02:42:27.571]  What did this man do?
[02:42:28.071 --> 02:42:29.892]  Freedom for you to be you?
[02:42:30.952 --> 02:42:32.252]  How dare you?
[02:42:32.752 --> 02:42:36.173]  How dare you not bow to the clowns in charge?
[02:42:36.613 --> 02:42:37.293]  Here, Queenie.
[02:42:37.453 --> 02:42:38.493]  Oh, Queenie's gone.
[02:42:38.914 --> 02:42:39.334]  Here, King.
[02:42:39.374 --> 02:42:39.974]  Here, boy.
[02:42:42.814 --> 02:42:45.295]  Robert Swan, Northern Ireland's health minister.
[02:42:46.158 --> 02:42:48.739]  Call the new song Samaritan dangerous!
[02:42:49.099 --> 02:42:50.119]  Health minister?
[02:42:50.400 --> 02:42:51.680]  Oh yes, minister!
[02:42:52.020 --> 02:42:52.580]  Minister!
[02:42:52.820 --> 02:42:55.682]  You're a little piece of bureaucratic crap!
[02:42:56.102 --> 02:42:59.803]  You're too damn stupid to get a job in the real world!
[02:43:00.083 --> 02:43:01.224]  Health minister!
[02:43:01.644 --> 02:43:03.104]  That's nobility!
[02:43:03.424 --> 02:43:04.165]  A minister!
[02:43:04.465 --> 02:43:08.926]  The noble, the king's up there, then you got the princes, and then you got the ministers!
[02:43:09.407 --> 02:43:10.247]  Minister!
[02:43:11.647 --> 02:43:13.068]  Minister moron!
[02:43:17.245 --> 02:43:18.906]  I don't know where he gets his facts.
[02:43:19.206 --> 02:43:22.527]  Yeah, because you're too damn stupid to know where he got his facts.
[02:43:23.088 --> 02:43:26.829]  I know where he got his facts, the same way I get my facts.
[02:43:27.149 --> 02:43:30.251]  For the Trends Journal, only the facts, freaky boy.
[02:43:30.891 --> 02:43:31.731]  Only the facts.
[02:43:33.112 --> 02:43:34.012]  I know the facts.
[02:43:36.514 --> 02:43:36.694]  Yep.
[02:43:38.775 --> 02:43:46.258]  I know where the emotions are on this, but I will say that sort of messaging is dangerous.
[02:43:47.034 --> 02:43:47.934]  You're dangerous.
[02:43:48.414 --> 02:43:50.615]  You are the dangerous people that destroyed life.
[02:43:51.655 --> 02:43:53.136]  You suck the joy out of life.
[02:43:53.676 --> 02:43:55.916]  No, things did not come back and they're going to get worse.
[02:43:56.756 --> 02:43:57.917]  And we're going to talk about that.
[02:44:00.197 --> 02:44:01.117]  We go on to write.
[02:44:03.258 --> 02:44:11.100]  Morrison makes it clear in his new songs how unhappy he is with the way the government has taken away personal freedoms.
[02:44:12.645 --> 02:44:17.547]  A statement said on his website announcing the release is according to agency false.
[02:44:18.628 --> 02:44:29.132]  The legendary singer called on the music industry to stand with him because concerts where social distancing is mandated are not financially feasible.
[02:44:30.033 --> 02:44:31.974]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:44:32.814 --> 02:44:35.655]  And again, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:44:35.975 --> 02:44:41.438]  I want to continue with my meeting with Van Johnson.
[02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:44.661]  And this great, great guitarist, John Petagna.
[02:44:46.642 --> 02:44:53.866]  I was reading an article, again, this article was written in the Trends Journal two years ago.
[02:44:55.126 --> 02:44:57.848]  Van Morrison on Trend with Solenti.
[02:44:57.868 --> 02:45:00.469]  Because these are the things that I've been saying.
[02:45:01.830 --> 02:45:05.972]  You go back to the Trends Journal cover, January 28th, 2020.
[02:45:06.492 --> 02:45:11.395]  The COVID war began on Chinese Lunar New Year.
[02:45:13.743 --> 02:45:15.964]  January 2020, the year of the rat.
[02:45:18.526 --> 02:45:20.647]  Next week, Trends Journal.
[02:45:20.988 --> 02:45:23.409]  Coronavirus, 106 dead in China.
[02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:26.952]  Our next line was 1.6 billion still alive.
[02:45:26.972 --> 02:45:27.992]  What are you telling me this for?
[02:45:29.853 --> 02:45:32.295]  The reason we have masks is the air is so filthy over there.
[02:45:32.955 --> 02:45:37.058]  Anyway, so we were at this right from the start.
[02:45:37.318 --> 02:45:43.022]  We knew it was to rob us of our rights, more of the new world disorder.
[02:45:44.452 --> 02:45:52.294]  And the bigs taking over and the elites, the nobility and all nobility taking over.
[02:45:54.014 --> 02:45:55.054]  The bigs own everything.
[02:45:56.894 --> 02:46:08.117]  Again, the legendary singer called on the music industry to stand with him because concerts where social distancing is mandated are not financially feasible for the artist or the venue.
[02:46:09.097 --> 02:46:09.917]  Here's our article.
[02:46:11.340 --> 02:46:12.280]  Again, you see the date.
[02:46:13.001 --> 02:46:13.981]  Not making this stuff up.
[02:46:18.162 --> 02:46:18.862]  Van Morrison.
[02:46:18.942 --> 02:46:19.122]  Yep.
[02:46:20.423 --> 02:46:26.445]  He goes on to say, Morrison goes on to claim that scientists are essentially making up, quote, crooked facts.
[02:46:26.925 --> 02:46:27.085]  Yep.
[02:46:27.705 --> 02:46:30.246]  They're not scientists.
[02:46:30.266 --> 02:46:31.726]  These are bureaucrats.
[02:46:32.727 --> 02:46:33.887]  People spelled it wrong.
[02:46:34.327 --> 02:46:35.588]  They're bureaucrats.
[02:46:36.468 --> 02:46:39.789]  They can't get a job in the real world, so they suck into the political system.
[02:46:43.959 --> 02:46:46.861]  In order for government officials to justify their mandates.
[02:46:47.782 --> 02:46:50.223]  So again, let's just remember how stupid it is.
[02:46:51.424 --> 02:46:53.846]  Right across the street from me is where they have the farmer's market.
[02:46:53.866 --> 02:46:56.808]  Used to have it in the street where it was fun, but now they have it in the county parking lot.
[02:46:58.249 --> 02:47:05.113]  And you have these little kindergarten people that call themselves adults, drawing circles outside on the sidewalk, six feet apart.
[02:47:05.133 --> 02:47:07.835]  Now this is a big open parking lot, right?
[02:47:08.496 --> 02:47:12.538]  The wind only blows every, and then every six feet in front of the vendors, circles.
[02:47:14.306 --> 02:47:20.571]  The wind only blows in straight lines along the sidewalk and in straight lines when you're in front of the vendors.
[02:47:20.611 --> 02:47:22.252]  It doesn't blow up and down or around.
[02:47:22.593 --> 02:47:22.933]  No, no.
[02:47:23.553 --> 02:47:24.314]  Six feet apart.
[02:47:24.934 --> 02:47:28.758]  Everything he said, Morrison said, is right on line.
[02:47:29.218 --> 02:47:32.340]  And I could keep going on and wearing masks when you're in an airplane.
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:37.364]  You could eat and drink without the mask on, but you got to put it on when you're not eating and drinking because COVID knows it, you know?
[02:47:38.085 --> 02:47:39.826]  So, like he said, they're crooked.
[02:47:40.046 --> 02:47:47.615]   And he said that That in order for government officials to justify their mandates.
[02:47:48.155 --> 02:47:49.476]  Yeah, look how stupid, remember?
[02:47:49.957 --> 02:47:50.998]  How stupid people are?
[02:47:52.559 --> 02:47:52.739]  Yep.
[02:47:54.280 --> 02:47:56.001]  All little kids playing instruments.
[02:47:56.342 --> 02:47:56.922]  Yep, there they are.
[02:47:56.942 --> 02:47:58.743]  Yep, on the same line.
[02:47:58.763 --> 02:47:59.144]  Look at this.
[02:48:00.245 --> 02:48:00.485]  Right?
[02:48:01.345 --> 02:48:03.347]  This is how sick societies become.
[02:48:04.053 --> 02:48:07.234]  And Van Morrison was one of the very, very, very few.
[02:48:07.795 --> 02:48:08.475]  Hey!
[02:48:08.835 --> 02:48:11.376]  Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young!
[02:48:11.656 --> 02:48:13.837]  You little coward boys!
[02:48:14.317 --> 02:48:17.259]  Oh yeah, but you were protesters during the Vietnam War.
[02:48:17.619 --> 02:48:19.259]  Wonder why, clownies!
[02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:21.740]  Oh, the draft would get ya!
[02:48:22.881 --> 02:48:23.281]  Yeah!
[02:48:23.781 --> 02:48:25.622]  You're all sold out!
[02:48:25.902 --> 02:48:28.483]  You're listening to a moron Kimmel!
[02:48:29.504 --> 02:48:32.405]  Yeah, one clown after another Colbert!
[02:48:33.766 --> 02:48:36.507]  Morrison was one of the real men out there.
[02:48:36.527 --> 02:48:38.687]  One of the real men.
[02:48:39.048 --> 02:48:41.928]  And at one time, artists led the charge.
[02:48:42.409 --> 02:48:42.849]  No more.
[02:48:43.249 --> 02:48:43.669]  No more.
[02:48:44.189 --> 02:48:45.229]  Most of them are freaks.
[02:48:45.990 --> 02:48:48.110]  And this is our trend post in this article.
[02:48:49.231 --> 02:48:50.511]  Or our trend forecast, rather.
[02:48:51.591 --> 02:48:55.272]  As Marshall McLuhan emphasized, the medium is the message.
[02:48:56.333 --> 02:49:09.877]   As we have forecast, art will be among the most powerful mediums To spread the message of liberty, love, joy, and beauty in an era of total corporate government control of the mainstream media.
[02:49:11.418 --> 02:49:20.619]   Entrepreneurs who understand the missing message large segments of the population want to embrace
[02:49:20.619 --> 02:49:28.699]   and use the proper mediums to market them will reap considerable financial and emotional rewards.
[02:49:28.699 --> 02:49:32.958]  Yep.
[02:49:36.699 --> 02:49:40.058]   Art is the way of finding the true meaning of the human spirit.
[02:49:40.894 --> 02:49:41.875]  And we talked about this.
[02:49:43.236 --> 02:49:45.437]  You know, he was mentioning about Davos and other things.
[02:49:45.517 --> 02:49:47.758]  I said, people don't... facts don't matter.
[02:49:48.259 --> 02:49:49.599]  Facts don't matter to people.
[02:49:51.300 --> 02:49:54.642]  We have to win over the masses and the masses don't listen to facts.
[02:49:56.203 --> 02:49:58.204]  I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy.
[02:49:58.705 --> 02:50:00.866]  A Yankee Doodle do or die.
[02:50:01.894 --> 02:50:03.595]  What do you mean do or die?
[02:50:04.075 --> 02:50:05.536]  Do or die for World War I?
[02:50:05.876 --> 02:50:09.458]  A war lied us into by a murderous freak?
[02:50:10.639 --> 02:50:12.340]  Woodrow Wilson, a clown?
[02:50:12.780 --> 02:50:14.061]  Harvard, Princeton, Yale.
[02:50:14.081 --> 02:50:17.103]  Yeah, former president of Princeton's bullets, bombs, and banks.
[02:50:17.423 --> 02:50:21.886]  This is the guy that gave us World War I. He gave us the Federal Reserve.
[02:50:21.906 --> 02:50:27.049]  And he gave us federal income tax.
[02:50:27.809 --> 02:50:29.971]  And the IRS, which is now getting $80 billion.
[02:50:31.303 --> 02:50:34.686]  So I said to Van, I said, we got to do this with art and music.
[02:50:34.706 --> 02:50:44.996]  I said, when you've created it, the lives that you've changed and all the other great musicians, we have to bring back that true spirit.
[02:50:45.016 --> 02:50:47.638]  It's been stolen from us.
[02:50:49.480 --> 02:50:51.482]  The King James Bible got it wrong.
[02:50:51.522 --> 02:50:54.004]  They said the meek shall inherit the earth.
[02:50:54.024 --> 02:50:57.087]  The geeks have inherited the earth.
[02:50:58.743 --> 02:51:02.204]  When the geeks took over, everything went down for the dressing light.
[02:51:02.684 --> 02:51:05.345]  I think I'll wear a black t-shirt and jeans.
[02:51:05.425 --> 02:51:08.406]  Well, I'll be Zuckerberg.
[02:51:08.446 --> 02:51:10.487]  I'll wear a blue t-shirt and jeans.
[02:51:11.487 --> 02:51:25.992]  Once upon a time, man, it was hip to look good, feel good, rock and roll, bop and stroll, and swing and boogie.
[02:51:27.881 --> 02:51:29.222]  And now it's one bad rap.
[02:51:32.204 --> 02:51:34.545]  The Renaissance followed the Black Plague.
[02:51:35.866 --> 02:51:39.608]  Alla Romana all'antica, in the manner of the Romans and the ancients.
[02:51:42.250 --> 02:51:46.652]  They described the quality of the work that they were making in the Renaissance.
[02:51:47.753 --> 02:51:50.835]  The people wised up that they were living low lives.
[02:51:51.295 --> 02:51:53.196]  And that's why so many people were dying.
[02:51:53.216 --> 02:51:57.459]  It went back to the past.
[02:52:02.085 --> 02:52:05.706]  And Van Morrison and his crew and a number of others.
[02:52:07.427 --> 02:52:08.968]  Tom Jones was also there.
[02:52:09.008 --> 02:52:10.268]  Man, the cat was singing.
[02:52:10.288 --> 02:52:11.869]  I couldn't believe he was 81 years old.
[02:52:11.929 --> 02:52:12.869]  Sounded like a young guy.
[02:52:14.190 --> 02:52:19.412]  They're giving the passion, the beauty, the joy, the creativity.
[02:52:19.432 --> 02:52:21.633]  They're giving it everything they can.
[02:52:22.793 --> 02:52:24.654]  And to me, that's what's going to change it.
[02:52:25.534 --> 02:52:27.135]  And we need a new political system.
[02:52:28.001 --> 02:52:32.284]  Anybody that votes Republican or Democrat, I don't want to talk to you.
[02:52:32.944 --> 02:52:34.265]  I don't want to talk to you!
[02:52:34.926 --> 02:52:36.006]  Oh, you like Bush?
[02:52:36.587 --> 02:52:38.048]  No, I like Clinton.
[02:52:38.468 --> 02:52:39.589]  I like Obama.
[02:52:39.749 --> 02:52:40.529]  I love Trump.
[02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:42.311]  I don't want to hear it!
[02:52:43.191 --> 02:52:44.772]  They've done nothing for us!
[02:52:45.493 --> 02:52:47.014]  Only for themselves!
[02:52:48.615 --> 02:52:49.896]  We need a new system.
[02:52:51.417 --> 02:52:51.977]  And art.
[02:52:53.038 --> 02:52:53.378]  Again.
[02:52:53.398 --> 02:52:56.120]  As Marie Pierre taught me.
[02:52:58.194 --> 02:53:00.556]  It's a way of finding the true meaning of the human spirit.
[02:53:03.178 --> 02:53:04.539]  And it's been sucked out of us.
[02:53:06.100 --> 02:53:07.261]  Again, I looked at the people.
[02:53:07.321 --> 02:53:16.689]  I was up in Saratoga racetrack during Labor Day weekend, end of the races.
[02:53:16.709 --> 02:53:19.371]  That was the number one racetrack in America at the time.
[02:53:19.391 --> 02:53:21.012]  One of the first ones.
[02:53:21.873 --> 02:53:22.854]  I was there 20 years ago.
[02:53:22.874 --> 02:53:23.775]  Everybody was dressed.
[02:53:25.456 --> 02:53:26.657]  And that was a slob show.
[02:53:28.159 --> 02:53:30.060]  Some people were dressed, 80% weren't.
[02:53:31.181 --> 02:53:34.263]  Same thing at the Van Morrison thing.
[02:53:34.283 --> 02:53:38.866]  Yeah, there were some nice-looking people dressed, but masses, no.
[02:53:40.927 --> 02:53:47.170]  And again, you know, it's, uh... We're in an ultra-processed world.
[02:53:48.031 --> 02:53:54.675]  Ultra-processed with the geeks, with their fake... sounds, and ultra-processed with fake food.
[02:53:55.359 --> 02:53:57.960]  We're going to take a break and we'll be right back about the economy.
[02:53:59.961 --> 02:54:01.782]  I went to the police station.
[02:54:02.782 --> 02:54:06.224]  I was all about starting an investigation.
[02:54:06.304 --> 02:54:07.364]  It's against the law.
[02:54:07.384 --> 02:54:09.145]  What my mama saw.
[02:54:09.925 --> 02:54:10.145]  Yeah.
[02:54:10.225 --> 02:54:11.005]  Goodbye, Rosie.
[02:54:11.045 --> 02:54:11.846]  Queen of Corona.
[02:54:12.126 --> 02:54:12.346]  Yep.
[02:54:13.066 --> 02:54:13.527]  Corona.
[02:54:13.547 --> 02:54:15.867]  That's my father's side of the family.
[02:54:15.887 --> 02:54:17.268]  A lot of them lived in.
[02:54:18.008 --> 02:54:18.288]  Yeah.
[02:54:18.449 --> 02:54:19.149]  You know, Corona.
[02:54:19.169 --> 02:54:21.350]  And you got my cousin, Liz.
[02:54:22.470 --> 02:54:23.231]  Queen of Corona.
[02:54:23.611 --> 02:54:23.831]  Yeah.
[02:54:25.354 --> 02:54:28.695]  And great Italian restaurants around there, boy.
[02:54:28.715 --> 02:54:36.378]  I remember going there and then going to the World's Fair for my Aunt Ida's house.
[02:54:36.398 --> 02:54:37.078]  Rest in peace.
[02:54:38.758 --> 02:54:40.919]  1964 World's Fair.
[02:54:42.159 --> 02:55:02.618]   Anyway, those who are those who are able to see beyond the shadows and lies of their culture will never be understood Let alone believed by the masses.
[02:55:02.638 --> 02:55:14.861]  So what we do with the Trends Journal, giving you facts and information and only putting them in there, they're not understood by the masses who are brainwashed.
[02:55:16.302 --> 02:55:25.944]  What Van Morrison said about what's going on and how we're being robbed of our freedom.
[02:55:28.291 --> 02:55:35.675]  He said that the UK government fascist bullies disturbing our peace.
[02:55:38.716 --> 02:55:47.240]  He says no more taking of our freedom and our God-given rights, pretending it's only for our safety when it's really to enslave.
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:48.441]  Those are his lyrics.
[02:55:50.602 --> 02:55:54.023]  So we're doing everything we can with the Trends Journal.
[02:55:54.564 --> 02:55:57.385]  Artists like Van Morrison and others are doing it with music.
[02:55:58.050 --> 02:56:05.153]  And InfoWars is doing it in the way they're doing it, with the information that they put out, the news coverage that they give, and their analysis.
[02:56:05.173 --> 02:56:09.574]  So what you really need to do is to support those who are supporting you.

[02:57:28.837 --> 02:57:38.425]  So, going back to where we left off, about art being the way of finding the true meaning of the human spirit, I believe it with all my heart.
[02:57:39.686 --> 02:57:42.208]  And that's the only way it's going to happen.
[02:57:42.868 --> 02:57:44.990]  Because the masters don't care about facts.
[02:57:46.118 --> 02:57:47.879]  Our magazine is filled with facts.
[02:57:48.980 --> 02:57:58.466]  There are people out there like Dr. Joseph Mercola, nothing but facts, blacklisted, taken off the air on YouTube as InfoWars and others.
[02:57:59.626 --> 02:58:00.667]  So we have to unite.
[02:58:02.188 --> 02:58:07.571]  So support the artists, support InfoWars, support the Trends Journal.
[02:58:08.452 --> 02:58:12.214]  We're giving you what you need to lift your spirits.
[02:58:13.348 --> 02:58:14.548]  In many different ways.
[02:58:15.188 --> 02:58:17.529]  And we're giving it to you in the Trends Journal.
[02:58:17.609 --> 02:58:21.370]  Financially, spiritually, morally, economically.
[02:58:21.390 --> 02:58:25.411]  We're giving you information that, you know, in Trend Forecast, you're not going to find anywhere.
[02:58:26.551 --> 02:58:28.452]  And again, go to support the artists.
[02:58:28.592 --> 02:58:31.272]  It was so wonderful to see a packed house.
[02:58:31.332 --> 02:58:32.353]  There were people out there.
[02:58:32.373 --> 02:58:33.393]  You got any tickets for sale?
[02:58:33.413 --> 02:58:34.473]  You got any tickets for sale?
[02:58:34.833 --> 02:58:35.513]  Some walking in.
[02:58:35.533 --> 02:58:38.034]  You know, they wanted to see this so badly.
[02:58:39.202 --> 02:58:41.944]  And seeing before, you know, the clock runs out.
[02:58:41.984 --> 02:58:45.386]  You know, I used to, how I loved Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra.
[02:58:45.406 --> 02:58:46.907]  They're gone, you know?
[02:58:48.588 --> 02:58:51.450]  Everybody loves somebody sometime.
[02:58:52.190 --> 02:58:56.353]  When the moon hits your eye like a bigger pizza pie, that's some ordering.
[02:58:56.373 --> 02:59:01.936]  Yeah, when the stars make you drool just like a pasta fazoola, that's some ordering.
[02:59:02.957 --> 02:59:05.738]  Bells will ring, ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling.
[02:59:06.559 --> 02:59:06.819]  Yeah.
[02:59:07.259 --> 02:59:08.080]  So anyway, they're gone.
[02:59:10.004 --> 02:59:15.445]  And support these people, you know, buy what they have, do what you can.
[02:59:16.366 --> 02:59:19.026]  Because if we don't unite, we're going to die.
[02:59:19.866 --> 02:59:21.107]  World War III has begun.
[02:59:22.487 --> 02:59:25.988]  Defiant Kremlin insists war will continue despite retreat.
[02:59:26.768 --> 02:59:29.709]  Ukraine recaptures dozens of settlements in Northeast.
[02:59:29.989 --> 02:59:31.929]  That's the headline out of CNBC.
[02:59:33.170 --> 02:59:38.731]  Ukraine inflicts major operational defeat on Russia as its forces retreat.
[02:59:40.455 --> 02:59:44.518]  You know, they weren't writing about this with the United States in its war with Iraq.
[02:59:44.878 --> 02:59:46.880]  Didn't hear about this in Afghanistan.
[02:59:47.760 --> 02:59:49.862]  Oh, you mean the United States didn't get defeated?
[02:59:51.103 --> 02:59:54.925]  How come you clowns weren't writing this every day, every day, every day?
[02:59:56.707 --> 02:59:57.487]  I'll tell you why.
[02:59:57.527 --> 02:59:58.888]  Because we're prostitutes.
[02:59:59.449 --> 03:00:00.509]  We're little lemons.
[03:00:00.930 --> 03:00:02.051]  We're little tappers.
[03:00:02.451 --> 03:00:04.732]  We're little Anderson Cooper girly boys.
[03:00:05.153 --> 03:00:06.314]  We're little nobodies.
[03:00:08.627 --> 03:00:10.949]  My mommy was Gloria Vanderbilt.
[03:00:11.429 --> 03:00:13.231]  Oh, she must have been a celebrity, too.
[03:00:13.731 --> 03:00:14.732]  Oh, no, a royalty.
[03:00:15.593 --> 03:00:20.897]  You wouldn't have got a job shoveling crap if it wasn't for your mother, so take it easy.
[03:00:23.639 --> 03:00:26.222]  These are the people that are selling us the garbage.
[03:00:27.343 --> 03:00:30.945]  Where were you with the other wars, you little war hawks?
[03:00:31.886 --> 03:00:33.888]  Again, look at the Transjournal cover.
[03:00:36.570 --> 03:00:37.311]  Support war?
[03:00:38.323 --> 03:00:39.244]  Support Satan.
[03:00:40.886 --> 03:00:43.108]  More billions of our dollars going there.
[03:00:43.509 --> 03:00:43.989]  That's right.
[03:00:44.490 --> 03:00:45.951]  Great Anthony Frieda artwork.
[03:00:47.012 --> 03:00:48.354]  We're doing everything we can.
[03:00:49.315 --> 03:00:50.917]  World War III has begun.
[03:00:52.265 --> 03:00:58.048]  It's now up to $67 billion of our money that's gone to Ukraine.
[03:00:58.068 --> 03:01:11.494]  $67 billion as the streets are filled with homeless, the bridges are rotting, the streets are filled with potholes, and people have lousy stinking jobs and can't make ends meet to enrich the military-industrial complex.
[03:01:13.595 --> 03:01:15.156]  And then on to the equity markets.
[03:01:15.216 --> 03:01:16.056]  It's a farce.
[03:01:16.556 --> 03:01:17.397]  It's a joke.
[03:01:19.518 --> 03:01:20.258]  It's a joke.
[03:01:22.586 --> 03:01:25.988]  And Gregory Manorino is writing a lot about it in this week's article.
[03:01:27.530 --> 03:01:28.270]  It's a joke.
[03:01:28.550 --> 03:01:32.773]  The market should be in the toilet with the toilet bowl people that are running it.
[03:01:33.194 --> 03:01:34.374]  Bunch of crapsters.
[03:01:36.056 --> 03:01:36.976]  What, are you kidding me?
[03:01:38.858 --> 03:01:41.199]  Business is nothing compared to what it used to be.
[03:01:43.141 --> 03:01:44.962]  Everywhere I go, empty buildings.
[03:01:47.063 --> 03:01:49.637]   I talked to the The drivers.
[03:01:50.298 --> 03:01:53.339]  I was, well, you know, it's not the same, you know, a lot of people working at home.
[03:01:54.540 --> 03:01:55.800]  Office occupancy rates.
[03:01:57.721 --> 03:01:59.782]  What are they, around 50-something percent?
[03:02:00.222 --> 03:02:01.683]  No, they're about 40 percent.
[03:02:03.104 --> 03:02:06.165]  That means 60 percent down from where it was.
[03:02:06.245 --> 03:02:08.406]  All the businesses that depended on it, gone.
[03:02:10.847 --> 03:02:15.870]  We're going into the worst financial crisis in human history.
[03:02:16.870 --> 03:02:18.151]  Or modern history, I should say.
[03:02:19.699 --> 03:02:21.621]  And when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:02:22.041 --> 03:02:23.182]  And they're taking us to war.
[03:02:24.262 --> 03:02:25.623]  Gold prices went up today.
[03:02:26.304 --> 03:02:28.586]  Oil prices are down, but they're going back up.
[03:02:29.366 --> 03:02:33.189]  And the more this war keeps heating up, the worse it's going to get.
[03:02:33.970 --> 03:02:34.950]  Particularly in Europe.
[03:02:37.572 --> 03:02:40.414]  You're gonna see protests and revolutions like you've never seen.
[03:02:42.096 --> 03:02:46.839]  And if we don't stop this, you got a mad woman in there, a little clown of a nobody, trust.
[03:02:47.099 --> 03:02:47.920]  How could you trust her?
[03:02:47.940 --> 03:02:49.061]  You gotta really be stupid.
[03:02:49.654 --> 03:02:52.876]  In the UK, that says she's ready to push a finger on the button.
[03:02:53.416 --> 03:02:55.817]  And look at the imbeciles we got running all the other countries.
[03:02:56.177 --> 03:02:59.159]  Are you like the little Katson Macron, the little nothing of a clown?
[03:02:59.419 --> 03:03:00.660]  The Rothschild girl boy?
[03:03:00.680 --> 03:03:04.121]  A Rothschild, that's what he is.
[03:03:04.161 --> 03:03:05.162]  A child nothing.
[03:03:05.442 --> 03:03:07.483]  An arrogant little piece of garbage.
[03:03:08.304 --> 03:03:09.244]  One after another.
[03:03:11.665 --> 03:03:12.766]  Support InfoWars.
[03:03:14.326 --> 03:03:20.367]  Support the musicians, buy what they have, the good ones, not the clown boys and girls that sold out.
[03:03:21.028 --> 03:03:25.729]  And if you want to know what in the world is going on and what to do, you really need a Trends Journal.
[03:03:27.009 --> 03:03:33.290]  And the products from InfoWars, they help you and they help InfoWars.
[03:03:34.151 --> 03:03:35.271]  So you really want to get them.
[03:03:36.571 --> 03:03:41.012]  You know, we're on the path of no return if we don't unite for peace.
[03:03:41.833 --> 03:03:43.693]  United we stand, divided we die.
[03:03:44.853 --> 03:03:46.494]  And I don't want to check out like this.
[03:03:46.514 --> 03:03:51.635]  You know, I want to have a, I want to, you know, I want a boogie before the lights go out.
[03:03:51.655 --> 03:03:53.796]  There ain't not enough boogie out there, man.
[03:03:54.956 --> 03:03:55.777]  Not too tight.
[03:03:56.617 --> 03:03:58.658]  Not a drop of boogie, not an ounce of jive.
[03:03:59.298 --> 03:04:00.298]  We got to bring that back.
[03:04:01.018 --> 03:04:03.379]  Again, go to Van Morrison, check him out.
[03:04:03.419 --> 03:04:04.540]  He's touring all around.
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:06.120]  You're not going to want to miss him.
[03:04:07.201 --> 03:04:09.581]  And do what you can.
[03:04:10.542 --> 03:04:11.222]  Do your part.
[03:04:12.034 --> 03:04:14.716]  To get in the best shape you can, and InfoWars will help you.
[03:04:14.956 --> 03:04:16.956]  Thank you.
[03:04:16.956 --> 03:04:27.115]   I'm going to shoot you straight right now because the truth is King.
[03:04:27.115 --> 03:04:27.956]  (upbeat music)
[03:04:28.186 --> 03:04:34.290]  Many of the InfoWarsStore.com products, many of the InfoWars line products are the very best available anywhere.
[03:04:35.331 --> 03:04:37.313]  But in the case of BrainForce+, it's not.
[03:04:38.382 --> 03:04:43.203]  No, Brain Force Plus is not the best nootropic, the best brain pill in the world.
[03:04:44.223 --> 03:04:44.683]  You know why?
[03:04:45.683 --> 03:04:55.625]  Well, imagine if you had the Kentucky Derby or the Indy 500, where five or six horses tied with that photo finish, their noses exactly the same.
[03:04:56.846 --> 03:05:03.527]  Or imagine a race car race where three or four race cars all went across the finish line at the exact same time.
[03:05:03.787 --> 03:05:04.667]  Now, that's never happened.
[03:05:06.374 --> 03:05:07.654]  Okay, so these supplements it has.
[03:05:07.874 --> 03:05:08.354]  You know why?
[03:05:09.635 --> 03:05:13.355]  Because we went out to the top manufacturers in the country.
[03:05:14.155 --> 03:05:19.536]  We looked at the tests and the research and we said we want the most powerful brain pill available.
[03:05:20.096 --> 03:05:26.897]  And we learned that this brain pill is put out by at least four companies under different names and it is the best.
[03:05:27.318 --> 03:05:31.558]  The highest rated for clean, focused, clarity and mental energy.
[03:05:32.498 --> 03:05:36.789]   So you can get this under other names at least Three other places.
[03:05:37.709 --> 03:05:40.610]  But, here's why it's different.
[03:05:40.630 --> 03:05:48.452]  Our pill, that is not number one, but is in the top four, is at a lower price at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:05:48.852 --> 03:05:51.032]  They are selling this exact same pill for up to $100.
[03:05:51.072 --> 03:05:58.113]  We're selling it for well less than half that price, and this funds the InfoWare.
[03:05:58.594 --> 03:05:59.254]  So that's a winner.
[03:06:00.074 --> 03:06:08.125]   Yes, We're tied in this horse race, in this race car race, but we're doing it for a lower price.
[03:06:08.625 --> 03:06:10.646]  That's why BrainForce Plus is so amazing.
[03:06:11.286 --> 03:06:20.188]  So get the recognized number one brain pill in the world, BrainForce Plus that funds the InfoWar at 50% off, finally back in stock at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:06:22.648 --> 03:06:34.047]   On April 23rd, 1910, The iconic American president who busted up the Rockefeller Trust in America gave his incredibly historic speech, Citizen in a Republic.
[03:06:35.748 --> 03:06:39.449]  It was the man in the arena speech that sent shockwaves throughout the world.
[03:06:40.370 --> 03:06:41.770]  And I live by this creed.
[03:06:41.790 --> 03:06:51.755]  I'm about to read to you just a short excerpt of the 30 plus minute speech he gave to over 5 million attendees in Paris, France.
[03:06:52.815 --> 03:06:53.736]  We have released a coin.
[03:06:54.855 --> 03:06:58.213]  That has Teddy Roosevelt on the front and a gladiator on the back.
[03:06:59.872 --> 03:07:02.913]  Discusses a citizen of the Republic and the man in the arena.
[03:07:03.693 --> 03:07:09.675]  And InfoWars and everything we do is about the man and the woman in the arena fighting tyranny.
[03:07:10.375 --> 03:07:17.018]  It's the fourth coin in the series we've offered at PatriotCollectibles.com or 1776coin.com.
[03:07:17.518 --> 03:07:20.939]  There are only 10,000 of this coin available.
[03:07:21.719 --> 03:07:27.161]  Ladies and gentlemen, this coin is funding our operations as men and women in the arena.
[03:07:28.072 --> 03:07:30.475]  Let me read to you part of his famous speech.
[03:07:31.095 --> 03:07:37.842]  It's not the critic who counts, not the man who points out how the strong man has stumbled, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better.
[03:07:38.283 --> 03:07:51.296]  The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs, who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming.
[03:07:51.576 --> 03:08:12.330]  But who does actually strive to do the deeds, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, who at worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be amongst the cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.
[03:08:13.050 --> 03:08:15.114]  This is the man in the arena coin.
[03:08:15.494 --> 03:08:16.797]  Only $10,000 in the world.
[03:08:17.197 --> 03:08:22.266]  Get yours now at 1776coin.com and take the info or the next level.
