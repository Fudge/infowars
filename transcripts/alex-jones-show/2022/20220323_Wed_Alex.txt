[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:14.053]  This is such an incredibly dangerous development that we're all witnessing, and it's a proxy war the globalists want to cover up the end of dollar hegemony, the end of the EU's currency, the end of the Chinese currency.
[00:00:14.353 --> 00:00:17.934]  There's been a race to the bottom of devaluing all these currencies.
[00:00:18.374 --> 00:00:29.969]   It's causing major inflation around the world, major starvation around the world, and now they're blaming it all on the conflict, That is just a repeat of basically what happened in World War Two along the original battle lines.
[00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:39.557]  So this is the detonator and the smoke screen for this fourth turning or this new world order that Biden has been talking about.
[00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:42.459]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists believe they can survive a nuclear war.
[00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.462]  They've got all these private and corporate and governmental underground bunkers and facilities.
[00:00:46.982 --> 00:00:48.604]  They've committed massive crimes.
[00:00:48.904 --> 00:00:49.945]  They're all going to go to prison.
[00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:58.569]  For the fractional reserve banking and the derivatives and selling mortgages 50, 60, 100 times a piece and all the incredible crimes.
[00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:11.256]  And so they really have positioned an economic collapse by design and war as the pretext for them to come out on top and depopulate the earth which they believe is overpopulated.
[00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:24.747]  It is critical for anybody out there that wants to not be in a total depression or worse, to not choose a side in this, and to realize the globalists are playing the different sides off against each other.
[00:01:25.067 --> 00:01:34.613]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:42.278]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are in existence.
[00:01:43.684 --> 00:01:46.129]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:50.117]  It's called the Great Reset, tough guy.
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.501]  It's called the New World Order.
[00:01:52.561 --> 00:02:02.549]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and a universal basic income.
[00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:03.670]  That's everything.
[00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:05.772]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:11.317]  The whole world's gonna be about surveillance and control and them manipulating and tracking everything you do.
[00:02:11.337 --> 00:02:12.858]  It's all being officially announced.
[00:02:12.878 --> 00:02:14.279]  I've got articles everywhere.
[00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:16.681]  There are press releases saying it!
[00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.341]  And then the crew asked me during the break, they go, Are you alright?
[00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:23.602]  You really seem upset here.
[00:02:23.722 --> 00:02:24.643]  Are you feeling okay?
[00:02:24.683 --> 00:02:26.665]  Well, man, they're about to have a nuclear war.
[00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:29.607]  I mean, they're gonna starve a couple hundred million people to death.
[00:02:29.667 --> 00:02:31.028]  Yeah, I'm pretty freaked out, yeah.
[00:02:31.048 --> 00:02:31.729]  But this is real.
[00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.912]  This is not... This is not a freaking game to me, man.
[00:02:38.073 --> 00:02:40.134]  Look, you understand, like, I like living, right?
[00:02:40.154 --> 00:02:40.854]  Don't you like it?
[00:02:40.874 --> 00:02:42.274]  Don't you like dying?
[00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:47.736]  People are already starving to death by the hundreds of millions right now.
[00:02:47.756 --> 00:02:49.756]  You know, you never see it on the news.
[00:02:49.897 --> 00:02:51.657]  They're dying right now.
[00:02:51.677 --> 00:03:02.900]  They're in their freaking houses, starving to death, begging for God to help them, and no one's coming because God tells us to get up and take action, and then we don't do anything!
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.901]  And that paralyzes God!
[00:03:04.941 --> 00:03:05.841]  Yeah, God can do it.
[00:03:07.293 --> 00:03:15.797]  Once again, not for the first time, what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be the truth.
[00:03:16.078 --> 00:03:16.598]  I'm upset.
[00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:19.980]  I'm really... I told you last night, what's wrong with you?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.100]  I'm really freaked out.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.561]  I'm like, yeah, I'm really freaked out.
[00:03:23.261 --> 00:03:24.262]  I'm really freaked out.
[00:03:24.482 --> 00:03:25.923]  I'm really freaked out.
[00:03:25.983 --> 00:03:27.283]  You see, because this is real.
[00:03:27.303 --> 00:03:31.766]  The supply chain being cut off, the energy grid being cut off is real.
[00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:37.937]  And we're going into a time now where we're not going to be on the air.
[00:03:38.078 --> 00:03:45.143]  I mean, if we don't back this off, if we don't get sane people to stop the globalists, I mean, we won't be here in six months.
[00:03:45.363 --> 00:03:54.851]  You won't be here in six months.
[00:03:56.172 --> 00:03:59.354]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:01.836]  Infowars.com Infowars comes to mind.
[00:04:01.956 --> 00:04:04.175]   Infowars.com InfoWars.
[00:04:04.195 --> 00:04:05.156]  You watch InfoWars?
[00:04:05.376 --> 00:04:06.377]  InfoWars.
[00:04:06.457 --> 00:04:08.518]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:04:08.678 --> 00:04:09.299]  Alex Jones.
[00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:09.859]  Nice guy.
[00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:12.441]  You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:04:12.622 --> 00:04:13.222]  Alex Jones.
[00:04:14.923 --> 00:04:15.624]  Alex Jones.
[00:04:15.724 --> 00:04:16.385]  Alex Jones.
[00:04:16.445 --> 00:04:17.666]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[00:04:17.726 --> 00:04:18.726]  Who knows who InfoWars is?
[00:04:18.746 --> 00:04:19.967]  Quit playing this joke over here.
[00:04:20.148 --> 00:04:21.509]  That's why the deplatforming didn't work.
[00:04:21.649 --> 00:04:24.991]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:04:24.872 --> 00:04:28.372]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:46.872]   We now are live inside the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas.
[00:04:46.872 --> 00:04:49.872]  (breathing heavily)
[00:04:48.227 --> 00:04:49.548]  Owen Troyer sitting in here.
[00:04:49.708 --> 00:05:03.474]  We are going to be hearing from Alex throughout the entirety of the first hour with all kinds of breaking news reports and responses to the news, which is just absolutely insane today.
[00:05:04.494 --> 00:05:13.132]   It seems to get more insane as the days go on, but We do get a clearer picture of what we're up against.
[00:05:13.172 --> 00:05:23.681]  We do get a clearer picture of what the global elite, globalists, shadow government, Illuminati, New World Order is up to.
[00:05:25.702 --> 00:05:31.647]  And if you could boil it down and say, what is it all about?
[00:05:31.747 --> 00:05:33.349]  What is the real agenda?
[00:05:36.158 --> 00:05:43.941]  What is all this madness from the drag queen story time to the men and women to the censorship to all of it?
[00:05:47.342 --> 00:06:00.648]  It's all about a new world order where you're indoctrinated and trained to believe from the day you're born till the day you die that you don't belong here.
[00:06:02.188 --> 00:06:03.129]  You're a parasite.
[00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.889]  You're a termite.
[00:06:04.932 --> 00:06:31.504]  And you're essentially eating this planet, which is going to be claimed for the globalists and the World Economic Forum and the Klaus Schwab's and the Bill Gates of the world, so your privilege is even being alive on Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates' planet, but you're going to live in a pod, you're going to eat the bugs, and you're going to be treated like a indentured servant, slave, peasant, because you're killing the planet.
[00:06:33.945 --> 00:06:36.007]  The Pentagon has been extremely clear.
[00:06:37.008 --> 00:06:39.270]  Russia's defense ministry has been crystal clear.
[00:06:40.390 --> 00:07:01.989]  But many voices on the left and the neocon right in the United States, in the UK and Europe are all calling for a no-fly zone to be enforced by NATO, which would bring NATO officially into war with Russia.
[00:07:02.984 --> 00:07:04.467]  Now, NATO's already had troops there.
[00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:07.915]  There's already been a proxy war going on for at least eight years.
[00:07:07.955 --> 00:07:09.578]  That's on record the CIA has bragged.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:18.290]   And Russia has said that if any type of no-fly zone is established that they will start shooting those aircraft
[00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.819]  down.
[00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:24.338]   Then when NATO aircraft get shot down, you know, the rest of the story, things will escalate
[00:07:24.338 --> 00:07:31.699]   there to tactical nuclear weapons and then a wider nuclear war and that's not good for anybody.
[00:07:31.699 --> 00:07:37.220]   There's a big story on Infowars.com that links to mainstream news reports in Europe
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:42.179]   and we've seen a lot of evidence that Poland is indeed pushing for this and has already called
[00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:46.689]  to ship their MiGs into Ukraine and then to have the U.S.
[00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:49.139]  backfill and replace those.
[00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:55.220]   Well now this, secret plan to send 10,000 NATO peacekeeping troops into Ukraine.
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.820]  Oh, they're peacekeeping.
[00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:02.580]   So when they give military aid, if Russia strikes them, Russia has struck peacekeepers.
[00:08:02.777 --> 00:08:05.840]  And now it's their fault World War III starts, according to the UN.
[00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:17.251]  A secret plan for a peacekeeping mission involving 10,000 NATO troops from different countries entering Ukraine and imposing a limited no-fly zone is allegedly being prepared by the Polish government.
[00:08:17.771 --> 00:08:30.877]  Polish news outlet, ONET, reports that the President of Poland is wanting and waiting on a green light from the White House before implementing the proposal.
[00:08:31.377 --> 00:08:41.722]  Created by the Polish Ministry of Defense, the plan would see 10,000 NATO troops form an international contingent sent to Ukraine to protect humanitarian corridors.
[00:08:42.262 --> 00:08:47.006]  And you know the State Department and CIA and NATO are all there training these troops right now.
[00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:49.088]  It's been going on even before the Russians invaded.
[00:08:50.669 --> 00:08:53.131]  And they would, quote, enforce a no-fly zone over them.
[00:08:53.711 --> 00:09:07.122]  It means setting up military units at a distance from the frontiers that would be tasked with defending humanitarian convoys with food and medicine, and of course weapons are chipping in, and the ones allowing civilians to escape danger.
[00:09:07.162 --> 00:09:14.887]   So they're opening up weapons corridors Because the Russians have started bombing those corridors coming out of Poland and stopping those shipments.
[00:09:15.247 --> 00:09:20.069]  So now they're going to put Western troops in, so you can't bomb these or you're killing Western troops.
[00:09:20.469 --> 00:09:24.071]  So they're sending the troops in as targets, as decoys, as a pretext for wider war.
[00:09:24.571 --> 00:09:36.737]   According to Remix News, one of the scenarios includes implementing a no-fly zone over the largest cities in Ukraine, which would mark a serious escalation and likely a direct conflict with Russia.
[00:09:37.137 --> 00:09:49.522]  The plan is seemingly on hiatus because of a disagreement between President Duba and the Ministry of Defense with law and justice leadership because the President of Poland wants Washington's approval before going ahead.
[00:09:49.542 --> 00:09:56.865]  According to the report, the White House will consider the plans before Thursday's NATO summit in Brussels before a decision can be made.
[00:09:58.126 --> 00:10:01.347]  Ladies and gentlemen, pray for a global awakening and pray for peace.
[00:10:01.907 --> 00:10:15.922]   This is such an incredibly Dangerous development that we're all witnessing and it's a proxy war the globalists want to cover up the end of dollar hegemony, the end of the EU's currency, the end of the Chinese currency.
[00:10:16.222 --> 00:10:19.804]  There's been a race to the bottom of devaluing all these currencies.
[00:10:20.245 --> 00:10:26.630]  It's causing major inflation around the world, major starvation around the world, and now they're blaming it all on the conflict.
[00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:31.845]  That is just a repeat of basically what happened in World War II along the original battle lines.
[00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:41.428]  So this is the detonator and the smoke screen for this fourth turning or this new world order that Biden has been talking about.
[00:10:41.548 --> 00:10:52.653]  So please, whether you're a Christian or whether you're a Jew or a Muslim or an agnostic or a Buddhist or black or white or old or young, you need to learn the geopolitical facts.
[00:10:52.713 --> 00:10:55.734]  I know a lot of you already know these facts, but others need to know these facts.
[00:10:56.943 --> 00:11:02.831]  And understand we are waltzing into Armageddon.
[00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:07.578]  And I'll add this point in closing as Owen takes over here today.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.220]  And it's this.
[00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:13.571]  Ladies and gentlemen, the globalists believe they can survive a nuclear war.
[00:11:13.872 --> 00:11:17.594]  They've got all these private and corporate and governmental underground bunkers and facilities.
[00:11:18.114 --> 00:11:19.715]  They've committed massive crimes.
[00:11:20.015 --> 00:11:29.700]  They're all going to go to prison for the fractional reserve banking and the derivatives and selling mortgages 50, 60, 100 times apiece and all the incredible crimes.
[00:11:30.221 --> 00:11:32.222]  And so they really have positions.
[00:11:33.487 --> 00:11:42.376]  An economic collapse by design and war as the pretext for them to come out on top and depopulate the earth, which they believe is overpopulated.
[00:11:44.025 --> 00:11:55.893]  It is critical for anybody out there that wants to not be in a total depression or worse, to not choose a side in this and to realize the globalists are playing the different sides off against each other.
[00:11:56.453 --> 00:12:01.777]  And it's also critical for everyone to realize that the globalists can't succeed if people are aware of what's going on.
[00:12:02.237 --> 00:12:05.799]  Again, the propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:12:05.859 --> 00:12:09.822]  So, spread the live feed of this show from InfoWars.com and ban that video.
[00:12:10.162 --> 00:12:12.404]  Tell folks about that local M&M's station you're listening to.
[00:12:13.104 --> 00:12:14.786]  And go to mfoilworkstore.com.
[00:12:15.026 --> 00:12:23.473]  We're having a up to 75% off mega blowout sale on t-shirts, books, films, supplements, everything, because the world's so dangerous.
[00:12:23.833 --> 00:12:32.140]  I'm getting all the funds in we can right now with the supply chain breakdowns so we can operate even if the supply chain completely breaks down for as long as possible.
[00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:47.627]  So this is a very serious time to get ready and dig in, get yourselves ready, take care of your family, but also prioritize keeping key sentinels of truth like InfoWars on the air that are critical towards the future of the American way of life and our Christian society.
[00:12:48.027 --> 00:12:49.488]  So again, thank you all for your support.
[00:12:49.788 --> 00:13:09.337]  Please visit InfoWarsTore.com now and check out some products that have been sold out that are back in stock, like Biotricillinium, Double Fizzy Magnesium Drink, and of course, our great new Immune Boosting Formula, and so much more, discounted, again, up to 75% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:12.458]  But whatever you do, pray for a global awakening and pray for peace.
[00:13:12.778 --> 00:13:13.579]  Back to Owen Schroer.
[00:13:15.618 --> 00:13:25.906]  And we've got more reports that have been filed by Alex that we're going to go to later on in this first hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:13:27.367 --> 00:13:30.889]  And let me just quickly kind of lay into the stack that I have.
[00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:36.354]  We're going to have updates on the nomination process of Judge Jackson.
[00:13:36.394 --> 00:13:39.736]  Folks, this is really an interesting one.
[00:13:39.876 --> 00:13:42.318]  It's kind of not been the main story.
[00:13:43.459 --> 00:13:59.202]   The one aspect of the nomination process that that has kind of gone mainstream, I guess you could say, or most people following this know about now, is Judge Jackson's clear judicial record of protecting pedophiles.
[00:14:00.002 --> 00:14:07.605]  But there's some other rifts and and things happening in that confirmation hearing that we will discuss.
[00:14:09.005 --> 00:14:38.838]   You know, I've, um, it's really a matter of Being in tune with reality and being smart and informed and having any form of intellect at all to understand that America is in a very dangerous downward spiral right now, economically, culturally, and if it continues like this, you're basically going to have a new modern day 21st century Great Depression.
[00:14:40.674 --> 00:14:53.083]  But the idea is to have a worldwide Great Depression that the World Economic Forum and the Davos Group and the UN and everybody else, all the world elites, all the globalists mop up.
[00:14:53.894 --> 00:15:00.139]  Essentially conquering the planet, and then, oh, if you survive this, you're just going to be lucky enough to live on Bill Gates' planet.
[00:15:00.159 --> 00:15:02.681]  You're going to be lucky enough to live on Klaus Schwab's spaceship.
[00:15:02.721 --> 00:15:03.722]  That's how they're going to sell it.
[00:15:03.782 --> 00:15:04.983]  Like, they own the planet.
[00:15:05.003 --> 00:15:07.826]  You're fortunate enough to even live on their planet.
[00:15:08.186 --> 00:15:12.069]  They have the right to just kill you if they so deem necessary.
[00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:20.016]  Whether it's with a secret lethal injection, or a biological weapon, or hell, they'll just mop you up and disappear you.
[00:15:22.048 --> 00:15:23.628]  And they're bragging about now.
[00:15:23.788 --> 00:15:25.749]  It's just, it's so overwhelming, folks.
[00:15:25.769 --> 00:15:27.450]  I mean, I've got news here.
[00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:33.151]  I mean, the crime rates in the U.S., I mean, what we're seeing in inner cities, I mean, this is disgusting.
[00:15:33.571 --> 00:15:43.534]  Do you realize that a group of teens beat an elderly woman to death on camera and they've been, and they've had their charges dropped?
[00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:52.796]  But Joe Biggs today just got sentenced to 30 days in solitary confinement as he goes a year in prison for walking into the Capitol.
[00:15:56.819 --> 00:15:58.961]  So, I've got that and so much more.
[00:16:01.843 --> 00:16:02.664]  We just gotta pray.
[00:16:02.924 --> 00:16:05.446]  Just pray for God's forgiveness and intervention, folks.
[00:16:06.427 --> 00:16:19.706]   You know, I sit here getting ready to come on air To do this segment, and I'm thinking, well, what's the biggest news story?
[00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:24.029]  What do you start the segment with?
[00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:25.510]  Where do you start the momentum here?
[00:16:27.171 --> 00:16:33.296]  And is it groups of teens, youths?
[00:16:33.736 --> 00:16:34.477]  You're not allowed to say.
[00:16:34.617 --> 00:16:38.099]  I mean, when it's, the left loves talking about skin color, I don't.
[00:16:38.139 --> 00:16:39.741]  But it's like, do I want to talk about skin color?
[00:16:39.781 --> 00:16:40.121]  Not really.
[00:16:40.141 --> 00:16:42.763]  I don't want to play these racist, bigoted games like the left plays.
[00:16:44.104 --> 00:16:49.828]  But see, if it's a group of black kids, it's teens.
[00:16:49.888 --> 00:16:52.749]  So do I sit here and do I highlight all the crime that's going on?
[00:16:53.050 --> 00:17:01.315]  Where now, you know, spring break in Florida, really popular thing, really a big thing in the 90s.
[00:17:01.335 --> 00:17:05.737]  They used to do TV specials and everybody would go down there and it was a great time.
[00:17:06.358 --> 00:17:07.919]  I went down there when I was in high school.
[00:17:10.196 --> 00:17:14.339]  But now, spring break in Florida ain't the same thing, is it?
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.583]  Shootings happening, Miami declaring a state of emergency, curfews declared.
[00:17:20.625 --> 00:17:39.220]  I've got multiple videos today of the mass crime spree continuing, retail theft, broad daylight it happens now, and then if you try to stop it, you try to stop a thief from going into a CVS or a jewelry store, you get charged with a crime.
[00:17:40.657 --> 00:17:47.444]  But if you're four teens that kill a 73-year-old grandmother, you get your charges dropped.
[00:17:49.886 --> 00:17:50.206]  What?
[00:17:54.150 --> 00:17:55.972]  Or maybe it's the vaccines killing people.
[00:17:56.352 --> 00:17:57.954]  Or maybe it's the vaccines not working.
[00:17:58.174 --> 00:18:00.837]  Maybe it's Pfizer admitting that their products cause cancer.
[00:18:02.138 --> 00:18:08.078]   Maybe it's the liberal out-of-control left admitting that They're just bringing in communism.
[00:18:08.118 --> 00:18:08.719]  It doesn't matter.
[00:18:08.779 --> 00:18:10.221]  You didn't vote for it.
[00:18:10.561 --> 00:18:13.465]  They're going to have a workaround through the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[00:18:14.486 --> 00:18:15.107]  Maybe it's that.
[00:18:15.848 --> 00:18:19.433]  Maybe it's the new Biden nominee for the Supreme Court that protects pedophiles.
[00:18:20.649 --> 00:18:25.674]  And that's just part of the corruption we're learning about this woman and this process that she's been involved in.
[00:18:25.934 --> 00:18:33.601]  Maybe it's the Hunter Biden laptop story that got buried, that now we know is confirmed, and we see it's even a worse situation with Bill Barr.
[00:18:33.881 --> 00:18:36.924]  Bill Barr was telling Trump to leave the Hunter Biden laptop alone.
[00:18:37.144 --> 00:18:38.125]  Oh, really, Bill Barr?
[00:18:38.425 --> 00:18:41.068]  Boy, oh boy, did that guy turn out to be a scumbag.
[00:18:43.462 --> 00:18:47.243]  Maybe it's the left lying about things like, don't say gay bill, that doesn't even exist.
[00:18:47.824 --> 00:18:52.065]  And then having men competing as women, because this is fifth wave feminism now, folks.
[00:18:52.085 --> 00:18:53.026]  We've gone full circle.
[00:18:53.446 --> 00:18:54.686]  Men are now women.
[00:18:57.687 --> 00:19:04.910]  Or maybe it's how the situation in Ukraine... See, it's not even really... For the people in Ukraine, it's sad.
[00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:09.011]  For the people dealing with that, it is in their front yard, their backyard.
[00:19:09.091 --> 00:19:20.033]   But for the planet, For the rest of the world, it's the threat of a World War III type situation, and I think Putin and his cronies are serious.
[00:19:21.373 --> 00:19:23.534]  And when you hear their latest comments, you realize they're serious.
[00:19:23.554 --> 00:19:34.679]  But oh, as the world economy collapses, Putin and Russia is the perfect scapegoat for all the globalist criminals with their stolen loot to blame.
[00:19:35.967 --> 00:19:43.354]  But that's what I'm saying is, okay, I've got stacks of all these different news stories that I'll bear into and we'll explain and we'll get in.
[00:19:43.574 --> 00:19:46.697]  But the big news story is how it's all connected.
[00:19:47.838 --> 00:19:48.819]  That's the big story.
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:57.166]  All the different sections are all connected.
[00:19:57.947 --> 00:19:59.668]  It's the Great Reset.
[00:20:00.469 --> 00:20:02.351]  It's the New World Order.
[00:20:04.591 --> 00:20:08.974]  And the best way to describe it to a layperson is just to say this.
[00:20:12.036 --> 00:20:14.297]  You're not going to be a free citizen anymore.
[00:20:16.018 --> 00:20:18.940]  America as you know it is not going to exist anymore.
[00:20:20.223 --> 00:20:25.708]  And life as we know it on planet Earth is soon to be a thing of the past.
[00:20:26.469 --> 00:20:36.597]  And it's not going to be a, oh, remember the good old days where slowly, generationally, things change and maybe life gets a little different and you see weirdness and all this stuff.
[00:20:36.657 --> 00:20:42.963]  No, it's going to be just a full-on reset where you're not reminiscing on the good old days.
[00:20:43.363 --> 00:20:46.446]  You're a slave in the new world order.
[00:20:47.898 --> 00:21:03.706]  And see, that's part of the propaganda with bringing up slavery in the West, and just associating slavery with black people in the West, when slavery has been an ancient human tradition, sadly, for thousands of years.
[00:21:03.766 --> 00:21:17.524]   White people enslaved, brown people enslaved, black people enslaved, and it was America that changed the world by ending slavery, but see, oh, America ends slavery so then it somehow becomes the bastion of being blamed for all slavery.
[00:21:18.085 --> 00:21:18.465]  I see.
[00:21:20.867 --> 00:21:31.077]  But see, that's all a distraction because you're going into a slave system now and it's going to be the Great Reset and then your social credit score.
[00:21:32.779 --> 00:21:33.699]  So that's the big story.
[00:21:35.148 --> 00:21:39.391]  I mean, I'm going to go in and cover all this news, but that's what people need to understand.
[00:21:39.711 --> 00:21:41.072]  That's the larger picture.
[00:21:41.553 --> 00:21:42.674]  That's the real story.
[00:21:42.914 --> 00:21:44.295]  All of this is by design.
[00:21:45.416 --> 00:21:51.340]  And some countries and some leaders have decided they don't want to go into it.
[00:21:52.741 --> 00:21:56.044]  And that's going to be the big problem for the globalists.
[00:21:57.057 --> 00:21:59.619]  I don't think Saudi Arabia wants to go into the New World Order.
[00:21:59.799 --> 00:22:01.980]  I don't think the UAE wants to go into the New World Order.
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:04.102]  Russia doesn't want to go into the New World Order.
[00:22:04.622 --> 00:22:06.843]  Brazil doesn't want to go into the New World Order.
[00:22:07.324 --> 00:22:09.225]  Mexico doesn't want to go into the New World Order.
[00:22:11.135 --> 00:22:15.097]  But see, America is kind of the centerpiece here.
[00:22:15.757 --> 00:22:22.400]  If America goes into the New World Order, then all the momentum into the Great Reset stems from there.
[00:22:22.741 --> 00:22:37.988]  Where if you have Trump in office, or somebody that doesn't want to go into the New World Order, all of a sudden this obstacle of the Great Reset, called the Free People of America, and the American economy, is an obstacle that the Great Reset can't just pass over easily.
[00:22:38.048 --> 00:22:40.069]  They'll have to physically conquer us at that point.
[00:22:41.107 --> 00:22:42.728]  Another biological weapon release.
[00:22:43.548 --> 00:22:45.149]  More people dying from the vaccines.
[00:22:45.469 --> 00:22:47.430]  Hitting your kids with gay moms in the schools.
[00:22:48.190 --> 00:22:49.471]  Just everything that you're seeing.
[00:22:50.511 --> 00:22:59.896]  It's all about demoralizing the United States, destroying the United States, so that they can then be mopped up in a new Great Depression into the new world order.
[00:23:01.997 --> 00:23:08.160]  Now... Folks...
[00:23:09.352 --> 00:23:28.627]  The hearings and that's the problem is really we should probably all be focused on these hearings right now for Judge Jackson because this is going to have long-term implications for our country and I would say it's you know it's probably 98% chance this pedophile protector gets nominated to the Supreme Court.
[00:23:29.188 --> 00:23:36.394]  Folks this woman is so dumb I mean she can't even answer basic questions like can you define a woman?
[00:23:37.666 --> 00:23:40.147]  I'm not even kidding you, we've got the video clips, it's all coming up.
[00:23:42.688 --> 00:23:45.849]  In fact, I'll play it right now.
[00:23:45.989 --> 00:23:52.632]  Look at how much of an embarrassment Kamala Harris is where Newt Gingrich goes on Fox News and says she's the dumbest woman ever put into office.
[00:23:52.752 --> 00:23:53.332]  I think he's right.
[00:23:54.639 --> 00:24:03.281]  So, but think about Kamala Harris, the token black person for the Democrats, now Judge Jackson, the new token black person for the Democrats.
[00:24:03.621 --> 00:24:07.141]  How is this going with the liberal tokenism?
[00:24:07.642 --> 00:24:08.822]  How's it going with Kamala Harris?
[00:24:08.862 --> 00:24:09.462]  Not so good.
[00:24:09.762 --> 00:24:11.002]  Almost her entire staff has quit.
[00:24:11.782 --> 00:24:15.743]  This is what you're going to get from your new token black Supreme Court Justice from the Democrats.
[00:24:16.583 --> 00:24:20.064]  Here's just a small sample size in clip one.
[00:24:21.831 --> 00:24:25.093]  Can you provide a definition for the word woman?
[00:24:26.994 --> 00:24:28.515]  Can I provide a definition?
[00:24:28.995 --> 00:24:29.196]  Yeah.
[00:24:30.556 --> 00:24:30.937]  I can't.
[00:24:31.937 --> 00:24:32.398]  You can't?
[00:24:34.899 --> 00:24:36.640]  Not in this context.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.001]  I'm not a biologist.
[00:24:39.842 --> 00:24:41.283]  Can't even tell you what a woman is, folks.
[00:24:41.323 --> 00:24:44.144]  That's how lost and gone the liberal left is.
[00:24:45.285 --> 00:24:55.672]   Alex Jones Responds to Biden nominee for the Supreme Court and pedophile protector Judge Jackson refusing to define what a woman is.
[00:24:56.133 --> 00:24:59.133]  Here is a report filed from Alex Jones.
[00:24:59.133 --> 00:25:14.133]  [Music]
[00:25:14.133 --> 00:25:19.133]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:25:19.133 --> 00:25:20.893]   *splat* - That's fine.
[00:25:21.005 --> 00:25:24.287]  Can you provide a definition for the word woman?
[00:25:26.168 --> 00:25:27.689]  Can I provide a definition?
[00:25:28.169 --> 00:25:28.389]  Yeah.
[00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:30.130]  I can't.
[00:25:31.111 --> 00:25:31.571]  You can't?
[00:25:34.093 --> 00:25:35.994]  Not in this context.
[00:25:36.034 --> 00:25:37.175]  I'm not a biologist.
[00:25:38.295 --> 00:25:44.099]  Senator Blackburn asked Judge Jackson a very simple question.
[00:25:45.097 --> 00:25:46.118]  What is a woman?
[00:25:47.239 --> 00:25:55.164]  And anybody in a sixth grade biology class would tell you, well, a woman has these type of chromosomes and a man has another type.
[00:25:55.284 --> 00:26:01.969]  And a woman is the female of the mammalian species of Homo sapien.
[00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:05.912]  And the male is the other side of a species.
[00:26:06.672 --> 00:26:24.015]   But no, the left is such a cult, and the Tavistock Institute is in such control, That the litmus test now, for whether someone is in their cult or not, is can they say a woman is a biological thing, a man is a biological thing.
[00:26:24.056 --> 00:26:28.238]  This is a direct attack on the biology of humans.
[00:26:28.258 --> 00:26:45.754]   When you're eradicating fire ants, or eradicating a type of fish, like carp, that's an invasive species in areas of the U.S., or you're eradicating a mosquito, They introduce mosquitoes that basically have a sterilant built into them.
[00:26:46.915 --> 00:26:48.316]  And it's the same thing with the carp.
[00:26:48.336 --> 00:26:50.257]  It's the same thing with the fire ants.
[00:26:50.638 --> 00:26:55.442]  When you are abating a species, you attack its reproductive system.
[00:26:56.582 --> 00:26:58.764]  Whether it's screw worms, the list goes on and on.
[00:26:59.585 --> 00:27:16.952]   And everything that's being done to us, with the chemicals, the biologicals, all of it, is about scrambling our endocrine systems, our hormonal systems, and creating a hermaphroditic That's why it's all in the 1931 book Brave New World written by Aldous Huxley, whose brother was the leading eugenicist.
[00:27:18.484 --> 00:27:31.890]  Julian Huxley, who headed up UNESCO at the UN a few years later, and again, Huxley, when he gave a speech at 61 at Berkeley about his book, Brave New World Revisited, that's non-fiction, explained this is the real plan for the world.
[00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:59.552]   But let us visit another dystopian classic that was also a projection of the future of what George Orwell, who'd been a top communist, working at the highest levels of the Fabian Socialist and the OSS, In 1984, projected into the future, he wrote essays before he died, in 1949, one year after the book came out, that he predicted the world would be like in 1984 if the communists were successful.
[00:27:59.572 --> 00:28:04.252]  He turned against them several years before he died, famously, when he found out how evil they were.
[00:28:04.873 --> 00:28:07.293]  And he said, it's like boots stomping on the human face forever.
[00:28:07.313 --> 00:28:17.667]   But the key to 1984 was, as Winston's been tortured for several months, O'Brien the Torturer says I want you to give up your will and be completely mentally ill.
[00:28:18.147 --> 00:28:20.408]  And if I say 2 plus 2 equals 10, it equals 10.
[00:28:20.549 --> 00:28:22.430]  If I say it equals 7, it equals 7.
[00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.651]  If I say it equals 4, it equals 4.
[00:28:25.271 --> 00:28:29.674]  I want you to hold all these ideas in your head at one time where you are a programmable robot.
[00:28:31.351 --> 00:28:36.974]  And Winston says freedom is the ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4 and he said that's right.
[00:28:37.414 --> 00:28:39.375]  And I'm going to suck your soul.
[00:28:40.055 --> 00:28:41.036]  I'm a priest of power.
[00:28:41.356 --> 00:28:43.937]  I will destroy men and I will be destroyed as well.
[00:28:44.397 --> 00:28:53.522]  This is an attack on God and I am going to annihilate your mind and then burn you up and inject your ashes into the atmosphere and you will never be remembered again.
[00:28:54.747 --> 00:29:00.191]  So imagine we have this woman who we're supposed to vote for and support and confirm because she's black.
[00:29:01.012 --> 00:29:05.115]  There are plenty of black judges that are constitutionalists and smart people, but no, no, no.
[00:29:05.495 --> 00:29:15.682]  She's there because she always gives under the minimum sentence to even child rapists and child pornographers, producers of child porn, people that actually rape children.
[00:29:16.283 --> 00:29:24.187]   She illegally, but nobody calls her on it, the appeals courts don't, is famous For protecting pedophiles.
[00:29:24.587 --> 00:29:30.409]  So, of course, Joe, the creepy Joe Biden, the Crypt Keeper is supporting her.
[00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:32.709]  So let's hear that audio.
[00:29:32.729 --> 00:29:44.692]  Let's see that video one more time where the Supreme Court nominee is telling the world she's not a biologist, so she can't tell you what a woman is.
[00:29:45.552 --> 00:29:50.507]   The ability To be free is to be able to say a man is a man, a woman is a woman.
[00:29:50.847 --> 00:29:54.211]  The ability to be free is to be able to say 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:29:56.232 --> 00:29:59.496]  Can you provide a definition for the word woman?
[00:30:01.397 --> 00:30:02.899]  Can I provide a definition?
[00:30:03.379 --> 00:30:03.599]  Yeah.
[00:30:04.961 --> 00:30:05.341]  I can't.
[00:30:06.322 --> 00:30:06.802]  You can't?
[00:30:09.305 --> 00:30:11.207]  Not in this context.
[00:30:11.247 --> 00:30:12.268]  I'm not a biologist.
[00:30:13.325 --> 00:30:18.629]  What's happening here with these kangaroo judges, these kangaroo courts, is very, very simple.
[00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:28.998]  They're giving cult-like litmus tests to prove they will serve whatever absurdist system or miscarriage of justice the corporate globalist establishment wants.
[00:30:29.879 --> 00:30:46.007]   And George Soros that brags that he's overthrown dozens of governments and crashed pension funds and robbed old people around the world, Also brags that he's gotten over a thousand district attorneys and county attorneys elected in the last five years and is in control of almost every U.S.
[00:30:46.027 --> 00:30:46.267]  city.
[00:30:46.287 --> 00:30:53.169]  He's also got currently more than 20 sitting state attorney generals under his control.
[00:30:53.749 --> 00:30:57.630]  And of course he's funded most of the Democrat federal judges out there.
[00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:24.366]  So it's no surprise that the Daily Mail's reporting New York City's elite are in a tizzy after Justice Department's inadvertently publishes a list of 121 clients, including lawyers, businessmen, socialites, who socialized with the sex cult victims who were forced into prostitution and a satanic sex cult, including federal and state judges in New York.
[00:31:25.146 --> 00:31:40.496]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we are facing more and more a criminal judiciary, a criminal judiciary controlled by all sorts of criminal organizations and groups, and a good percentage of them are pedophiles.
[00:31:40.976 --> 00:31:49.239]  There are still some good judges and some good district attorneys, but more and more, this is how the globalists have chosen to capture our nation and take over our planet.
[00:31:49.739 --> 00:31:56.682]  Now, back to Owen Schroyer and the live transmission at InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:31:57.042 --> 00:32:04.225]  If you're watching or listening to this transmission, you've got to share it and override their censorship, because you are the resistance.
[00:32:06.297 --> 00:32:13.767]  Back here live in the Info Wars studio, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm just, I'm just overwhelmed with the news.
[00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:25.539]   It becomes a challenge just to focus and cover one story because You dig into one story, you just connect the rest of the dots, just like Alex was just doing.
[00:32:25.579 --> 00:32:26.999]  It's like, hmm, okay, let's see here.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.661]  Pedophile protecting judge, okay.
[00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:39.104]  Hunter Biden's laptop with all the sex and drug abuse and minors and everything on that, okay, covered up by the media.
[00:32:40.664 --> 00:32:46.907]  The left going into the classroom and teaching kids how to be gay and mutilate their genitals, hmm, all right.
[00:32:49.551 --> 00:32:54.275]  And it's just, it's so demonic.
[00:32:55.416 --> 00:32:56.757]  It's so satanic.
[00:32:56.797 --> 00:32:58.859]  It's so filthy and disgusting.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:09.307]  And yet, I'm getting stories and updates sent to me every day about January 6th defendants that are rotting and being tortured in jail.
[00:33:09.728 --> 00:33:11.429]  Joe Biggs has now spent a year in jail.
[00:33:11.729 --> 00:33:15.973]  He's just been placed on 30 days solitary confinement.
[00:33:17.334 --> 00:33:30.442]   But a group Of four teens, youths, they always have code words, you know what it is, murder a woman in broad daylight and have their charges dropped.
[00:33:33.425 --> 00:33:40.191]  How does an individual in Houston go into school, shoot up the school, including a teacher, he's released from jail in less than 24 hours?
[00:33:43.683 --> 00:33:45.664]  How has our nation become so broke?
[00:33:46.564 --> 00:33:48.465]  I mean, that's the question people should be answering.
[00:33:48.525 --> 00:33:51.166]  How has our country become such a failed state?
[00:33:51.206 --> 00:33:52.426]  How have we become so broke?
[00:33:52.447 --> 00:33:53.767]  How have we become so corrupt?
[00:33:54.707 --> 00:33:57.829]  It's all by design, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:59.329]  This is the fall of America.
[00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.530]  This is the fall of the free market.
[00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:03.451]  This is the fall of a sovereign nation state.
[00:34:05.152 --> 00:34:23.133]   And it just sucks that we have to sit here and deal with it because whether you're left, right, center, Whatever you are politically, everybody should be standing together in unison against the Great Reset and against the New World Order that's going to enslave all of us.
[00:34:24.333 --> 00:34:26.175]  But you get deceived by the propaganda.
[00:34:27.216 --> 00:34:28.737]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:28.817 --> 00:34:30.558]  Owen Schroer sitting in studio.
[00:34:30.638 --> 00:34:34.001]  But first, another report from Alex Jones.
[00:34:35.882 --> 00:34:38.945]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:39.806 --> 00:34:42.288]  Owen Schreier is going to be taking over live here in just a moment.
[00:34:43.009 --> 00:34:51.857]  But I wanted to lay out the basic facts of why I started the broadcast with a Supreme Court nominee saying that she can't say what a woman is.
[00:34:53.044 --> 00:34:59.729]  That is the reason we're in so much trouble, is the cult-like control the left has over their minions' minds.
[00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:10.958]  And the litmus test of total submission to fraud that they have to subserve themselves to, to be given access to the power structure.
[00:35:12.199 --> 00:35:17.263]  It shows that they are unthinking slaves of the biomedical tyranny.
[00:35:18.204 --> 00:35:23.172]   Now, let's talk about The current situation in Ukraine.
[00:35:23.992 --> 00:35:27.473]  Biden seeks new sanctions, help for Ukraine and Europe.
[00:35:28.094 --> 00:35:32.715]  Hellscape, where over 100,000 people are trapped in one city alone.
[00:35:32.735 --> 00:35:33.656]  I'm reading direct headlines.
[00:35:34.275 --> 00:35:37.634]  Outgunned air force fighting back.
[00:35:37.634 --> 00:35:40.074]  Dissent broods over Putin leadership.
[00:35:40.074 --> 00:35:43.554]  Vlad allies warn of nuclear dystopia.
[00:35:43.554 --> 00:35:47.076]  Squads order to kill deserting soldiers on both sides.
[00:35:47.076 --> 00:35:49.395]  Church promotes war.
[00:35:49.395 --> 00:35:51.994]  Kremlin lashes out at Poland.
[00:35:51.994 --> 00:35:56.435]  Belarusian military could soon join war.
[00:35:56.435 --> 00:35:57.835]  That's what happens with wars.
[00:35:58.498 --> 00:36:00.079]  They escalate very, very quickly.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.402]  There was a big poll out.
[00:36:03.303 --> 00:36:09.489]  70% of Russians want Russia to attack Poland for staging troops and weapons there.
[00:36:10.009 --> 00:36:13.412]  Can you imagine if Poland would have actually given those big fighters over?
[00:36:14.331 --> 00:36:20.571]   to Ukraine. And that's how these wars escalate very, very quickly. And that's why it's bad
[00:36:20.571 --> 00:36:25.491]   that Soros and NATO destabilized and pushed Russia into this. Doesn't mean it's good that
[00:36:25.491 --> 00:36:31.251]   Putin invaded. But now, this is the crisis we're sitting in the middle of with gas rationing
[00:36:31.251 --> 00:36:38.251]   signs, gasoline and diesel rationing signs going up on the east and west coast where
[00:36:38.731 --> 00:36:42.550]  it's telling you you can get a limited amount of fuel.
[00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:49.181]   Because along with massive increases in prices, we're also seeing the hyperinflation that is
[00:36:49.181 --> 00:36:53.291]   going to send a cascade effect out into the economy across the world.
[00:36:53.312 --> 00:36:57.696]  This was caused by the private central banks, particularly the EU and China, but the U.S.
[00:36:58.517 --> 00:37:05.202]  a close second, overprinting euros, dollars, yen, yuan, and other major currencies.
[00:37:05.983 --> 00:37:10.747]  And how convenient now that Vlad has invaded so that he can take the blame.
[00:37:11.227 --> 00:37:12.688]  Is Vlad in smoky rooms?
[00:37:12.748 --> 00:37:14.090]  Everybody asks me this on the street.
[00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:17.210]  and the office and on the air with callers.
[00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:18.809]  Is Vlad in on this at all stage?
[00:37:18.809 --> 00:37:20.369]  The answer is no.
[00:37:20.369 --> 00:37:27.690]   But if you know all the geopolitical fissures, Vladimir Putin has been saying since 2007,
[00:37:27.690 --> 00:37:34.070]   if you continue to move weapons in up to our borders, continue to have NATO expand, then
[00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:35.890]  we may invade one of those countries.
[00:37:35.889 --> 00:37:42.934]  So he massed troops there months ago, said he might invade if they didn't make a declaration that Ukraine would not join NATO.
[00:37:44.275 --> 00:37:48.338]  And instead, Zelensky and others said they were trying to join NATO and the Euro.
[00:37:48.458 --> 00:37:54.122]  Then Biden pulled out of Afghanistan very precipitously, made a fool out of himself.
[00:37:54.322 --> 00:37:57.184]  I believed on purpose to entice Russia to invade.
[00:37:57.244 --> 00:37:58.065]  I said that at the time.
[00:37:58.765 --> 00:38:00.807]  And then what else happened?
[00:38:02.079 --> 00:38:07.100]  Biden said two weeks before Putin invaded, we're not going to militarily strike back if you invade.
[00:38:07.501 --> 00:38:08.781]  Just don't take the whole country.
[00:38:09.081 --> 00:38:11.642]  And you notice Putin has only taken about a third of the country.
[00:38:12.022 --> 00:38:15.203]  So at high levels, they signaled and they communicated.
[00:38:15.223 --> 00:38:16.683]  And that's a fact.
[00:38:17.123 --> 00:38:20.204]  And remember, I'm not just telling you this in hindsight to sound smart.
[00:38:20.564 --> 00:38:23.525]  Once you know that this is what's really going on and knowledge is power.
[00:38:23.805 --> 00:38:34.994]   That's how I told you in October that I thought That Russia or China, both, China's backed down, it's not going well for Russia right now, would be invading Taiwan and Ukraine.
[00:38:35.415 --> 00:38:39.279]  And that's the best thinking we've got at this point on that situation.
[00:38:41.388 --> 00:38:44.570]  Infowars is truly tomorrow's news today.
[00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:51.294]  The globalists don't want the public to be able to reverse engineer what they're doing because knowledge is power.
[00:38:51.314 --> 00:38:54.816]  And as Christ said, my people perish for lack of knowledge.
[00:38:54.835 --> 00:39:00.674]   That's why I'm asking listeners now to count the cost and realize how important you are
[00:39:00.674 --> 00:39:06.614]   and to make the commitment today and every day to tell perfect strangers, your neighbors, your coworkers,
[00:39:06.614 --> 00:39:11.275]   people at church, folks in parking lots, people at the grocery store, people online
[00:39:11.275 --> 00:39:17.255]   about the truth living at Infowars.com and the real resistance to this tyranny
[00:39:17.255 --> 00:39:22.915]   forming at Infowars.com for a peaceful revolution of understanding and renaissance.
[00:39:22.899 --> 00:39:31.447]  Please promote Bandai Video and InfoWars.com by word of mouth and then URLs they haven't blocked yet like Battleplan.news.
[00:39:31.607 --> 00:39:41.216]  And separately, we have the Democratic Party funded, Soros funded, Bloomberg funded, globalist law firms in rig courts and rig trials.
[00:39:42.662 --> 00:39:46.385]  Trying to shut us down and we don't even have the funds to go through these battles.
[00:39:46.445 --> 00:39:54.892]  We need the funds so we get a shot at an appeal later or at least stall them so they're not able to shut down InfoWars, which is their admitted un-American plan.
[00:39:55.353 --> 00:40:00.817]  The New York Times again says they want to shut down the case for ending the First Amendment, the free speech problem.
[00:40:01.297 --> 00:40:05.817]  These are very, very sinister forces, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:05.817 --> 00:40:11.576]   But your prayers, your word of mouth is overriding them, and your funds will continue to keep us on air
[00:40:11.576 --> 00:40:15.537]   as obviously other backup systems with other independent private groups
[00:40:15.537 --> 00:40:16.976]  have already been established.
[00:40:16.976 --> 00:40:21.737]   But we need to keep InfoWars as a flagship, the mothership battling and continuing
[00:40:21.737 --> 00:40:27.057]   to have devastating victories in the heart of the battle, but your funds are ammunition in the InfoWars.

[00:41:30.757 --> 00:41:35.195]  Now back to Owen Schroeder and the live transmission.
[00:41:36.996 --> 00:41:38.996]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, and...
[00:41:38.996 --> 00:41:48.996]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:41:40.166 --> 00:42:04.451]  In this second hour, I'm going to actually cover all the news, I'm going to get to all the headlines, and all the video clips, but I'm just kind of sitting here reflecting on everything, and I realize that my frustration is, I really can't even cover this news anymore, seriously.
[00:42:04.471 --> 00:42:06.151]  I mean, that's the problem.
[00:42:07.697 --> 00:42:09.239]  Everybody knows what's going on.
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:11.462]  The Great Reset is public.
[00:42:11.502 --> 00:42:12.764]  The New World Order is public.
[00:42:13.545 --> 00:42:15.708]  The pro-pedophilia is public.
[00:42:15.768 --> 00:42:19.213]  The protection of the corrupt political class like the Bidens is public.
[00:42:20.154 --> 00:42:22.457]  I don't need to come on here and break this news every day.
[00:42:23.803 --> 00:42:36.172]  Because it's already out there, people already get it, and it's even making its way into mainstream news now, where not everybody that's a total corrupt, sold-out bastard is starting to report on it and call it out.
[00:42:36.212 --> 00:42:43.938]  And then they get banned from network news, and okay, so then they go to alternative news platforms as well, and then big tech bans them.
[00:42:45.219 --> 00:42:46.220]  So it's all happening.
[00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:50.984]  It's like, InfoWars next year's news today, InfoWars next decade's news today.
[00:42:52.734 --> 00:43:10.980]  It becomes this struggle of do I report the news and everything that's going on now to then make the final conclusion or then report the bigger story of how all of it's leading to the Great Reset and how you're being propagandized 24-7?
[00:43:13.761 --> 00:43:16.762]  Because we can sit here and tell you what's coming next.
[00:43:17.808 --> 00:43:26.232]  I mean we can sit here just like we've done with Alex Jones and InfoWars for 20 plus years and tell you what's coming next all day long.
[00:43:26.512 --> 00:43:27.972]  But I think you already get that.
[00:43:30.533 --> 00:43:38.477]  So the real challenge is, what do we do to be even more effective now?
[00:43:40.769 --> 00:44:03.504]  And it's this weird thing where it's almost as if we have to just accept now we're in this, and get out of kind of the defensive or offensive position in the information war, and not wave the white flag or give up, but just like start dancing or something ridiculous, and like turn into a court jester.
[00:44:03.524 --> 00:44:15.604]   And it's well known, I mean you would have kings with their comedians, their court jesters, And as soon as they would start making jokes about the king or point out flaws in royalty, well what would happen?
[00:44:15.624 --> 00:44:16.305]  They'd get killed.
[00:44:16.725 --> 00:44:25.511]  Because see, that aspect of comedy at a certain point in political corruption becomes more devastating than actually telling the truth about what they're doing.
[00:44:25.931 --> 00:44:31.615]  Is accepting that that's the reality and then joking about it becomes more effective than actually just talking about what it is.
[00:44:31.955 --> 00:44:33.616]  And I'm thinking we may have reached that position.
[00:44:34.923 --> 00:44:41.193]  It's kind of like in, you know, in Guardians of the Galaxy when Chris Pratt starts dancing at the end to distract the bad guy and that's how they defeat him.
[00:44:41.013 --> 00:45:01.173]  It's like, is that what InfoWars needs to do now?
[00:45:01.979 --> 00:45:07.747]  And that is because the economy is breaking down, inflation is exploding, the supply chains have broken down.
[00:45:08.488 --> 00:45:13.509]  And InfoWars is having serious trouble making its payroll and paying for operations.
[00:45:13.569 --> 00:45:18.650]  And I do not want to implode or downsize in the face of the globalists making their main move.
[00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:22.031]  InfoWars, it's paradoxical, is more popular than ever.
[00:45:22.111 --> 00:45:24.591]  It's reaching more people than ever despite the censorship.
[00:45:24.951 --> 00:45:32.393]  But because of cost increasing and having to run our own infrastructure and pay for our own bandwidth and everything else, we are running out of money.

[00:45:52.052 --> 00:45:58.452]   Ladies and gentlemen, if you understand this next story, you really begin to understand
[00:45:58.452 --> 00:46:00.052]  everything.
[00:46:00.052 --> 00:46:06.771]   And while this is just an aspect of the fake news and the propaganda, as soon as you realize
[00:46:06.771 --> 00:46:12.253]   it is literally fake news, that's not just a cliche, it's literally fake news, it's literally
[00:46:12.253 --> 00:46:18.412]   propaganda and it's aimed at you as a psychological weapon of war to conquer you, as soon as you
[00:46:18.412 --> 00:46:22.012]  get and understand that, everything else flows from that.
[00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:29.498]   That's the antithesis That's why the censorship is so heavy right now, because they know that's the beginning, that's why InfoWars has been so effective.
[00:46:29.518 --> 00:46:31.299]  So if you understand this story, you understand everything.
[00:46:32.459 --> 00:46:46.207]  And we've had similar stories here in America, but this one is from Canada, and it's just been revealed, but it's the same thing, whether it's the Hunter Biden laptop, or a fire extinguisher was used to beat in Officer Brian Sicknick.
[00:46:46.347 --> 00:46:47.587]  All lies, all proven.
[00:46:49.248 --> 00:47:05.415]   So, during the Freedom Convoy, Canadian Media, propaganda, and parliament members said that the Freedom Convoy was responsible for arson and they were burning down buildings in Canada.
[00:47:06.055 --> 00:47:06.796]  They all said it.
[00:47:07.793 --> 00:47:14.135]  Well, they admit now, as of this week, they're now admitting that never happened.
[00:47:14.836 --> 00:47:16.416]  Literally, never happened.
[00:47:16.656 --> 00:47:24.239]  There was no connection with the Freedom Convoy and arson, and the police have come out and confirmed that, and now even its mainstream media.
[00:47:25.791 --> 00:47:28.812]  Arson a tip during Freedom Convoy has no connection to protesters.
[00:47:28.872 --> 00:47:30.732]  Now, so they admit this now.
[00:47:31.072 --> 00:47:34.373]  A month after all of it, two months after all of it, they admit they lied.
[00:47:34.673 --> 00:47:38.634]  Just like they lied about Officer Sicknick being hit with a fire extinguisher, that was a lie.
[00:47:38.994 --> 00:47:43.695]  They lied about the Freedom Convoy being connected to an arson event.
[00:47:43.875 --> 00:47:47.556]  Didn't happen, never happened, but it was the biggest story at the time.
[00:47:49.357 --> 00:48:05.118]   So here's a compilation of all the Canadian media and Canadian members of Parliament Adding fuel to this fake news story and perpetuating this lie on the people of Canada that's now been totally disproven.
[00:48:05.318 --> 00:48:06.458]  Will there be any apologies?
[00:48:06.898 --> 00:48:07.238]  No.
[00:48:07.278 --> 00:48:08.199]  Is anyone going to get sued?
[00:48:08.419 --> 00:48:08.699]  No.
[00:48:08.859 --> 00:48:09.779]  It's propaganda.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:10.780]  They're evil.
[00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:14.541]  They're agents acting against you with psychological warfare.
[00:48:14.821 --> 00:48:24.065]  Here's the clip of Canadian media and members of Parliament lying all day long about the Freedom Convoy and an arson event.
[00:48:25.445 --> 00:48:27.126]  Violence is commonplace.
[00:48:28.419 --> 00:48:36.683]  We saw an example of this violence, an attempted arson downtown of an apartment building, where people started a fire.
[00:48:38.564 --> 00:48:41.265]  When they exited, they taped the door.
[00:48:42.526 --> 00:48:46.028]  And an attempted arson, all of which, Madam Speaker, was caught on video.
[00:48:46.886 --> 00:48:52.211]  It has been an illegal occupation that has been harassing people in residential areas of Ottawa.
[00:48:52.532 --> 00:48:54.133]  People don't feel safe in their own homes.
[00:48:54.574 --> 00:48:56.475]  There have been reports of attempted arson.
[00:48:57.016 --> 00:49:04.063]  Canadians are also concerned hearing reports of attempted arson in the lobby of a residential apartment building.
[00:49:04.363 --> 00:49:10.089]  Because we see hate speech, we see illegal acts such as arson.
[00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:12.191]  The incessant honking.
[00:49:12.812 --> 00:49:13.853]  The arson attempts.
[00:49:14.274 --> 00:49:15.596]  The incessant honking.
[00:49:16.217 --> 00:49:17.518]  The arson attempts.
[00:49:17.819 --> 00:49:21.443]  An attempted arson of a residential building in the occupation area.
[00:49:21.523 --> 00:49:27.391]  We've seen the active sabotage of 911 emergency call lines and even an attempted arson.
[00:49:28.192 --> 00:49:30.553]  Other alleged crimes have even been more egregious.
[00:49:31.254 --> 00:49:34.476]  Ottawa police are investigating the attempted arson of a downtown apartment building.
[00:49:35.076 --> 00:49:37.637]  The situation persists, fueled in part by foreign funding.
[00:49:37.898 --> 00:49:40.979]  We saw reports of attempted arson in some of the buildings.
[00:49:41.019 --> 00:49:48.283]  And it certainly does not include arson or pushing into a residential apartment building and barricading the exits with handcuffs.
[00:49:48.363 --> 00:49:52.646]  The arrests for conspiracy to murder, attempted arson of a residential building.
[00:49:53.186 --> 00:49:56.208]  Over the past three weeks, we have watched assaults, attempted arson.
[00:49:56.903 --> 00:49:58.385]  They have been living in fear.
[00:49:58.985 --> 00:50:02.169]  Fear that their apartment buildings may be torched by arson.
[00:50:02.269 --> 00:50:05.393]  Seen assaults, attempted arson, widespread harassment.
[00:50:05.413 --> 00:50:13.902]  There's been attempted arson with the attempt of handcuffing doors shut so that if a fire started people would be burned alive.
[00:50:14.563 --> 00:50:15.104]  Death threats.
[00:50:16.169 --> 00:50:17.210]  An attempted arson.
[00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:21.813]  A building had an attempted arson where the doors were taped shut.
[00:50:22.313 --> 00:50:25.875]  Another building had occupiers attempting to handcuff the doors.
[00:50:26.356 --> 00:50:28.897]  There are reports of attempted arson, bomb threats.
[00:50:29.138 --> 00:50:31.699]  Hate crimes, misogyny, arson.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.281]  Horns honked all night long.
[00:50:35.122 --> 00:50:37.743]  We saw thefts and attempted arson.
[00:50:38.003 --> 00:50:39.544]  It literally never happened, folks.
[00:50:39.684 --> 00:50:40.505]  It literally never happened.
[00:50:40.545 --> 00:50:42.106]  But the left burns buildings to the ground.
[00:50:42.146 --> 00:50:43.247]  They call it a peaceful protest.
[00:50:44.958 --> 00:50:46.258]  It's called the Great Reset.
[00:50:47.058 --> 00:50:47.539]  Tough guy.
[00:50:48.739 --> 00:50:49.839]  It's called the New World Order.
[00:50:49.899 --> 00:50:59.881]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and a universal basic income.
[00:50:59.961 --> 00:51:01.001]  That's everything.
[00:51:01.281 --> 00:51:03.102]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[00:51:03.382 --> 00:51:08.623]  The whole world's gonna be about surveillance and control and them manipulating and tracking everything you do.
[00:51:08.663 --> 00:51:10.183]  It's all being officially announced.
[00:51:10.443 --> 00:51:11.623]  I've got articles everywhere.
[00:51:11.663 --> 00:51:13.904]  There are press releases saying it!
[00:51:17.512 --> 00:51:20.333]  And the crew asked me during the break, they go, are you all right?
[00:51:20.353 --> 00:51:20.953]  You really seem upset.
[00:51:21.073 --> 00:51:21.974]  Are you feeling okay?
[00:51:21.994 --> 00:51:23.855]  Atlanta's about to have nuclear war.
[00:51:23.935 --> 00:51:26.696]  I mean, they're going to starve a couple hundred million people to death.
[00:51:26.736 --> 00:51:28.036]  Yeah, I'm pretty freaked out.
[00:51:28.076 --> 00:51:29.077]  Yeah, this is real.
[00:51:29.117 --> 00:51:33.117]  This is not a freaking game to me, man.
[00:51:33.117 --> 00:51:37.117]  Do you understand how I feel about that?
[00:51:37.117 --> 00:51:39.117]  I mean, I can't talk about that.
[00:51:39.117 --> 00:51:44.117]   People are already starting to have hundreds of millions right now.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:47.121]  You know, you never see it on the news.
[00:51:47.221 --> 00:51:48.542]  They're dying right now.
[00:51:48.562 --> 00:51:57.447]  They're in their freaking houses, starving to death, begging for God's help, and no one's coming because God tells us to get up and take action, and then we don't do anything!
[00:51:58.427 --> 00:51:59.828]  And that paralyzes God!
[00:52:02.293 --> 00:52:03.194]  Yeah, God can do it.
[00:52:03.774 --> 00:52:07.136]  But God needs us to do it, because God's got free will.
[00:52:07.716 --> 00:52:13.020]  Once again, not for the first time, what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory turned out to be true.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:13.940]  Yeah, I'm upset.
[00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:16.242]  I'm really... I told you last night.
[00:52:16.382 --> 00:52:17.442]  I said, what's wrong with you?
[00:52:17.663 --> 00:52:18.443]  Really, I'm freaked out.
[00:52:18.463 --> 00:52:19.904]  I'm like, yeah, I'm really freaked out.
[00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:21.585]  I'm really freaked out.
[00:52:22.426 --> 00:52:24.727]  I'm really freaked out, you see, because this is real.
[00:52:25.507 --> 00:52:29.110]  The supply chain being cut off, the energy grid being cut off is real.
[00:52:32.248 --> 00:52:35.271]  And we're going into a time now where we're not gonna be on the air.
[00:52:35.411 --> 00:52:42.477]  I mean, if we don't back this off, if you don't get sane people to stop the globalists... I mean... We won't be here in six months.
[00:52:42.497 --> 00:52:47.041]  You won't be here in six months.
[00:52:51.825 --> 00:52:56.689]  Who is the most banned news network in the world?
[00:52:56.789 --> 00:52:57.670]  Infowars.com.
[00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:59.171]  Infowars comes to mind.
[00:52:59.291 --> 00:52:59.772]  Infowars.
[00:53:00.709 --> 00:53:01.510]  InfoWars.
[00:53:01.550 --> 00:53:02.490]  You watch InfoWars?
[00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:03.711]  InfoWars.
[00:53:03.791 --> 00:53:05.852]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:53:06.032 --> 00:53:06.632]  Alex Jones.
[00:53:06.692 --> 00:53:07.213]  Nice guy.
[00:53:07.253 --> 00:53:09.794]  You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[00:53:09.954 --> 00:53:10.555]  Alex Jones.
[00:53:12.256 --> 00:53:12.976]  Alex Jones.
[00:53:13.056 --> 00:53:13.716]  Alex Jones.
[00:53:13.796 --> 00:53:14.997]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[00:53:15.077 --> 00:53:16.078]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[00:53:16.118 --> 00:53:17.298]  I'm playing this joke over here.
[00:53:17.478 --> 00:53:18.839]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[00:53:18.979 --> 00:53:22.321]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:53:22.201 --> 00:53:29.201]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:53:29.201 --> 00:53:36.201]   The Globalist Crime Syndicate always telegraphs their next move.
[00:53:36.547 --> 00:53:47.971]  They do that for a lot of reasons, but the big one is showing off to their minions in government and in corporations so that they realize how much power the shadow government has.
[00:53:48.711 --> 00:54:07.992]   And if you look at Klaus Schwab, if you look at the UN, if you look at Bill Gates, if you look at academia, If you look at the Biden administration, and the State Department, and the CIA, they have been saying for years, the Russians are going to launch an attack on our power grid.
[00:54:09.053 --> 00:54:23.321]  But don't worry, once the attack on the power grid happens, we will reset things and the dollar will no longer be what you use, or the yen, or the yuan, or the ruble, or the... It'll be a new global currency.
[00:54:23.681 --> 00:54:29.377]   So they're trying to Get out of the worldwide financial bubble they've created.
[00:54:29.397 --> 00:54:30.879]  They don't want to go to prison like Bernie Madoff.
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:50.256]  And so they want to terrorize everyone and make them believe that in a war somebody attacked their bank account, somebody attacked their power grid, the Russians, and so now they've got to come up with a whole new system and you see them as the saviors.
[00:54:51.177 --> 00:54:52.018]  This is the big issue.
[00:54:53.459 --> 00:54:55.120]  And it's the next move.
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:55:05.027]  And I've been telling you for two years that after the virus fear mongering, they would then move on to a war and then a cyber attack.
[00:55:05.928 --> 00:55:07.189]  And just like clockwork.
[00:55:08.962 --> 00:55:10.883]  All the different globalist mouthpieces are there.
[00:55:11.363 --> 00:55:23.088]  I mean, we've seen Klaus Schwab a year and a half ago going, if you think that it is bad from COVID, wait until you see the power outage, the cyber attack.
[00:55:23.709 --> 00:55:25.829]  This will help us with the Great Reset.
[00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:29.231]  They don't even hide what they're doing.
[00:55:30.805 --> 00:55:32.286]  So we're smart enough to understand this.
[00:55:32.306 --> 00:55:46.517]  We're smart enough to realize what we're facing and to get the word out and let people understand that the globalists get power from crises and that they want the controlled collapse of civilization and they don't have our best interests at heart.
[00:55:47.518 --> 00:55:51.180]  This is the most critical information we've ever released.
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:55.382]  We've proven we have a track record of seeing over the horizon with predictions.
[00:55:55.902 --> 00:55:57.002]  And I believe in humanity.
[00:55:57.062 --> 00:55:57.923]  I'm betting on you.
[00:55:58.343 --> 00:56:06.387]  And I believe that the majority of us from race, color, and creed don't want to live in a collapsed society, civil war, road warrior situation.
[00:56:07.107 --> 00:56:11.389]  And I believe now you have the smarts to help us all collectively get out of this.
[00:56:12.289 --> 00:56:13.450]  Not just as Paul Revere's.
[00:56:14.309 --> 00:56:23.214]  But as individuals that help build the new civilization that's so beautiful, so powerful, so amazing that the globalist model of conquest and evil becomes obsolete.
[00:56:26.636 --> 00:56:38.823]   Now you may notice we already have the signs and symptoms That you're living in the Mad Max Thunderdome scenario already.
[00:56:39.904 --> 00:56:44.467]  The massive crime sprees, the massive increase in homicide rates.
[00:56:45.467 --> 00:56:52.712]  I mean, I could do three hours a day of broadcasting just covering all the crime that goes on.
[00:56:52.872 --> 00:56:54.714]  And it's always in Democrat-run cities, by the way.
[00:56:54.894 --> 00:56:55.914]  I don't believe that's a coincidence.
[00:56:56.835 --> 00:56:57.756]  In fact, I know it's not.
[00:56:58.396 --> 00:56:59.757]  Democrats go light on crime.
[00:57:01.525 --> 00:57:02.986]  And so criminals run wild.
[00:57:03.386 --> 00:57:04.426]  Criminals run rampant.
[00:57:05.407 --> 00:57:11.949]  And now they've told black people that, yeah, commit crimes as much as you want and we will defend you and drop your charges.
[00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:13.630]  You commit murder, we'll drop your charges.
[00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:15.391]  You rape a woman, we'll drop your charges.
[00:57:15.571 --> 00:57:16.331]  As long as you're black.
[00:57:18.492 --> 00:57:19.473]  And that's what goes on now.
[00:57:22.914 --> 00:57:26.756]  And you can look at the video and the situation that just came out in New Orleans.
[00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:34.733]  Where an elderly white woman, grandma, gets dragged out of her car and beaten to death by four teens.
[00:57:35.913 --> 00:57:36.854]  Four teens.
[00:57:37.454 --> 00:57:38.435]  Non-white supremacists.
[00:57:40.316 --> 00:57:40.796]  And guess what?
[00:57:40.816 --> 00:57:41.837]  They had their charges dropped.
[00:57:46.759 --> 00:57:47.840]  And so that's what happens.
[00:57:48.860 --> 00:57:55.124]  And you're seeing the increase, not just in the crime, but obviously the prices of living as well.
[00:57:58.666 --> 00:58:00.026]  And you know what's happening now, folks?
[00:58:00.986 --> 00:58:04.947]  People are having their gas stolen out of their vehicles.
[00:58:05.187 --> 00:58:06.407]  People are siphoning gas.
[00:58:06.647 --> 00:58:16.329]  People are drilling into... They're going around to cars that are parked on the street, drilling into their gas tanks and stealing their fuel.
[00:58:16.369 --> 00:58:17.589]  That's now mainstream news.
[00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:25.491]  They're figuring out ways to basically rig the price at the pump.
[00:58:29.076 --> 00:58:31.337]  You see the mass retail crime happening?
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:36.501]  Look at this one.
[00:58:36.641 --> 00:58:40.283]  More than 1,700 gallons of fuel stolen by gas thieves.
[00:58:42.028 --> 00:58:52.012]  Constable Mark, this is in Houston, Constable Mark Herman says the thieves were able to get away with more than $8,000 worth of fuel from a Chevron gas station, and that's just one story.
[00:58:52.032 --> 00:58:53.633]  That's just happening at the pump.
[00:58:54.433 --> 00:59:03.137]  These criminals are also going out in the streets and drilling into your car's gas tank, taking it that way, or siphoning it out as well.
[00:59:04.958 --> 00:59:16.646]   Yeah, here's a scene, broad daylight, Beverly Hills, broad daylight, A group of teens, a group of teens, non-white supremacist, rob a jewelry store.
[00:59:17.206 --> 00:59:33.417]  And you may recall, it was just a few months ago, there was a petition in Beverly Hills to get rid of all the jewelry stores because these teens, these youths, keep breaking in and robbing them, sometimes at gunpoint.
[00:59:36.259 --> 00:59:37.981]  You're already in the Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:59:38.968 --> 00:59:40.429]  It's been brought in intentionally.
[00:59:41.269 --> 00:59:43.290]  It's the collapse of civilization.
[00:59:44.570 --> 00:59:46.031]  It's called the Great Reset.
[00:59:46.111 --> 00:59:48.251]  It's called Build Back Better.
[00:59:49.712 --> 00:59:52.713]  But first, to build back better, you must destroy.
[00:59:54.394 --> 00:59:56.034]  That's what the Great Reset is all about.
[00:59:58.195 --> 01:00:03.297]  And so, see, you have to try to understand the psychology of a globalist.
[01:00:03.317 --> 01:00:06.238]  You have to try to understand the psychology of a Klaus Schwab, of a Bill Gates.
[01:00:07.185 --> 01:00:12.808]  Look at it like, they look at this planet like they're playing a game of SimCity or RollerCoaster Tycoon or something.
[01:00:12.828 --> 01:00:14.129]  And they've already done it.
[01:00:14.169 --> 01:00:15.589]  They've already accomplished all their things.
[01:00:15.629 --> 01:00:16.870]  They've already beaten all the levels.
[01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:18.431]  They've already reached the Master Class.
[01:00:18.451 --> 01:00:21.292]  They have all the resources, all the money, everything they need.
[01:00:21.712 --> 01:00:23.773]  So they just figure, let's just wipe it all out.
[01:00:24.494 --> 01:00:26.595]  Let's just destroy this planet and start over.
[01:00:27.035 --> 01:00:28.336]  That's what they're doing!
[01:00:29.628 --> 01:00:41.875]  You're having your planet, your way of life, your country destroyed intentionally, and they brag about it, calling it Build Back Better and the Great Reset, and all the fools fall for their propaganda.
[01:00:42.795 --> 01:00:45.257]  How's it all gonna go down, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:00:45.397 --> 01:00:54.962]  Are we gonna go into a century or a millennia of bondage and oppression against humanity, the likes of which we may never escape?
[01:00:57.225 --> 01:01:18.673]   Or are we going to go into a new golden age of human enlightenment and prosperity, the likes of which we've never seen, and it's Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, Our politicians, our mainstream media, all these sex cults, everyone, they're trying to stop us from going into the next golden age, folks.
[01:01:18.713 --> 01:01:19.493]  They hate you.
[01:01:19.753 --> 01:01:20.793]  They hate your family.
[01:01:20.993 --> 01:01:22.074]  They hate your freedoms.
[01:01:22.294 --> 01:01:23.254]  They hate your God.
[01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:25.935]  They want you dead and enslaved.
[01:01:26.135 --> 01:01:27.256]  Have you figured it out yet?
[01:01:30.177 --> 01:01:31.597]  The world doesn't have to be this way.
[01:01:32.718 --> 01:01:33.198]  It doesn't.
[01:01:34.978 --> 01:01:39.060]  But maybe it always will be, because we're always going to have to face evil.
[01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:46.293]  But when we hide from evil and we cower from evil and we don't want to address evil and be honest about it, then evil takes over.
[01:01:48.634 --> 01:01:50.334]  And that's what we're experiencing right now.
[01:01:50.394 --> 01:01:52.716]  Here's just some of the latest headlines at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:59.479]  Treasury Secretary Yellen to discuss freezing Russian gold reserves.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:04.621]  I mean, folks, this is just crazy.
[01:02:06.402 --> 01:02:10.284]   Russia Putin wants to bring back a gold standard.
[01:02:12.105 --> 01:02:14.567]  And Russia has a lot of gold and so does China.
[01:02:15.888 --> 01:02:22.414]  And they're looking to get out of the petrodollar, they're looking to get out of the US as the world's reserve currency, the US dollar.
[01:02:23.555 --> 01:02:31.401]  And so China and Russia's massive gold reserve is going to be part of that process and so now the Fed is trying to figure out how they can stop that from happening.
[01:02:32.642 --> 01:02:37.026]  You know, you can sit here and say Putin is a bad guy or Zelensky is a bad guy or whatever.
[01:02:38.171 --> 01:02:39.072]  They're not your problem.
[01:02:39.132 --> 01:02:40.594]  Your problem is Janet Yellen.
[01:02:40.794 --> 01:02:42.256]  Your problem is Joe Biden.
[01:02:43.116 --> 01:02:44.558]  Your problem is Jen Psaki.
[01:02:44.598 --> 01:02:46.200]  Your problem is the Democrat Party.
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:49.423]  Your problem is the corrupt Republicans.
[01:02:52.307 --> 01:02:53.248]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:02:54.249 --> 01:03:02.404]   So, you know, I really think I mean, it's basically Putin versus the entire New World Order right now.
[01:03:03.245 --> 01:03:10.814]  And you're going to see Saudi Arabia and the UAE definitely probably join forces, and you'll have smaller countries like Belarus and others join forces.
[01:03:11.335 --> 01:03:15.040]  Mexico and Brazil may start getting involved down the line, too.
[01:03:16.642 --> 01:03:17.663]  But that's what it is, folks.
[01:03:18.755 --> 01:03:19.815]  Maybe Putin's a bad guy.
[01:03:19.875 --> 01:03:20.636]  Maybe he's a good guy.
[01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:21.176]  It's irrelevant.
[01:03:21.216 --> 01:03:23.017]  Putin is taking on the entire New World Order.
[01:03:23.437 --> 01:03:24.677]  And he's on a suicide mission.
[01:03:24.717 --> 01:03:25.738]  He knows they want to kill him.
[01:03:26.058 --> 01:03:28.119]  He knows that this whole thing might start World War III.
[01:03:29.239 --> 01:03:30.399]  But he figures, you know what?
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:39.643]  If this is the fight to stop all Russians from becoming slaves to the Bilderberg Group, then I'm willing to take that chance.
[01:03:41.744 --> 01:03:42.624]  And that's what's going on.
[01:03:44.941 --> 01:03:49.786]  Meatflation expected to remain stubbornly high after midterms, or ahead of midterms.
[01:03:49.986 --> 01:03:51.267]  Yes, this is part of the Great Reset.
[01:03:51.307 --> 01:03:54.911]  Pricing you out of meat so that you have to eat the bugs.
[01:03:55.672 --> 01:03:56.232]  It's good for you.
[01:03:56.873 --> 01:03:57.093]  You know?
[01:03:57.894 --> 01:04:02.158]  These liberal globalists, they love you so much, they don't even want you to eat steak and have pets, don't you know?
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:06.743]  Capital riot suspect receives asylum in Belarus.
[01:04:08.344 --> 01:04:08.705]  Yeah!
[01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:23.784]  Don't be surprised, ladies and gentlemen, do not be surprised if similar stories don't start popping up here and there, because what are you going to do when you're a political prisoner of the Democrat Party and you get tortured?
[01:04:24.124 --> 01:04:27.685]  Do you really want to have the fate of Joe Biggs breaks my heart?
[01:04:29.686 --> 01:04:45.852]   Do you really want to have the fate of Joe Biggs, who walked into the Capitol on January 6th, At most, should probably be dealing with a trespassing charge, who's now spent a year in jail, and is now in a 30-day solitary confinement lockdown.
[01:04:45.912 --> 01:04:48.912]   Who knows if he'll ever get out again? Who knows, they may just kill him in there.
[01:04:48.912 --> 01:04:52.912]  *sigh* Oh my god.
[01:04:52.912 --> 01:04:56.912]  Oh my god.
[01:04:56.912 --> 01:04:59.912]  It's just sad, man.
[01:04:59.912 --> 01:05:09.912]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:05:01.145 --> 01:05:03.287]  It's just unbelievable how much evil we're facing.
[01:05:06.696 --> 01:05:12.618]  And so yeah, what are Americans going to do that are facing the fate of Joe Biggs?
[01:05:14.538 --> 01:05:18.799]  A year in jail and now 30 days solitary confinement, being tortured throughout the process.
[01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:24.661]  You think that other people, other January 6th defendants are just going to sit here and wait to face that same fate?
[01:05:26.341 --> 01:05:28.942]  Or do you think they're going to start looking for other countries for asylum?
[01:05:29.182 --> 01:05:29.922]  Like Russia?
[01:05:30.563 --> 01:05:31.263]  Or Belarus?
[01:05:32.123 --> 01:05:33.283]  Where did Edward Snowden go?
[01:05:34.724 --> 01:05:35.824]  Where is he still today?
[01:05:38.636 --> 01:05:42.980]  Used car prices fall as Goldman points out supply chain alleviation.
[01:05:44.861 --> 01:05:46.503]  I'm not so sure that's going to stick around.
[01:05:48.064 --> 01:05:50.806]  Most new cars are not even getting to lots.
[01:05:50.847 --> 01:05:52.708]  They're still in the process of being built.
[01:05:52.728 --> 01:05:54.430]  There's still a massive supply chain shortage.
[01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:56.832]  And you know, it's already so ridiculous.
[01:05:58.100 --> 01:05:59.941]  They already have this gas guzzler tax.
[01:06:00.681 --> 01:06:04.483]  If you buy a combustion engine vehicle, you pay $2,000 to the government.
[01:06:04.723 --> 01:06:08.924]  I mean, just straight up blatant theft.
[01:06:12.646 --> 01:06:17.728]  You buy a car that runs on gas, you pay $2,000 to the government.
[01:06:17.788 --> 01:06:19.028]  It's called a gas guzzler tax.
[01:06:20.889 --> 01:06:21.329]  Criminal.
[01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:22.750]  Robbery.
[01:06:24.977 --> 01:06:29.639]  All right, I am excited to see the liberal left's response to this.
[01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:32.880]  This is an ongoing situation, by the way.
[01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:33.521]  This isn't new.
[01:06:33.701 --> 01:06:39.183]  This has been going on for the entire time Russia's been going into Ukraine.
[01:06:39.643 --> 01:06:41.784]  Ukraine blocks trans woman refugees.
[01:06:41.824 --> 01:06:42.464]  They are men.
[01:06:42.604 --> 01:06:43.785]  They must go back and fight.
[01:06:43.985 --> 01:06:45.245]  Ooh, ouch!
[01:06:46.366 --> 01:06:51.048]  Can we still support Ukraine, even though they're so bigoted that they don't believe men are women?
[01:06:52.605 --> 01:06:54.165]  Curious how the liberals feel about this.
[01:06:55.106 --> 01:06:59.087]  Can you still support a bigoted Ukraine that believes men are women?
[01:07:00.327 --> 01:07:09.110]  Must be tough to live with the intellectual doublethink, the illogical doublethink of being a liberal.
[01:07:09.690 --> 01:07:10.711]  Must be tough.
[01:07:11.911 --> 01:07:13.311]  No wonder you're so messed up.
[01:07:13.431 --> 01:07:15.072]  No wonder you're such basket cases.
[01:07:15.152 --> 01:07:18.313]  No wonder you're such mentally depraved psychotics.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.822]  Because you're lost in a world that doesn't exist.
[01:07:25.184 --> 01:07:37.512]  Where we now nominate dingbat morons like Judge Jackson to the Supreme Court who protects pedophiles.
[01:07:40.775 --> 01:07:43.777]  I mean, do you understand that she had a case in front of her?
[01:07:46.438 --> 01:07:48.480]  Judge Jackson had a pedophile case in front of her.
[01:07:49.977 --> 01:07:55.142]  Where the case, the law, the government says you should get 72 months in prison.
[01:07:56.723 --> 01:08:03.049]  The prosecution said that the criminal should get 28 months, and she gave that person 3 months.
[01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:06.372]  72 months, Jackson put a pedophile in jail for 3 months.
[01:08:06.413 --> 01:08:13.299]  That's what I'm saying, man.
[01:08:13.339 --> 01:08:15.121]  It's like, I don't even know how to deal with this anymore.
[01:08:16.596 --> 01:08:18.357]  It's all so insane.
[01:08:18.397 --> 01:08:19.578]  It's all so obvious.
[01:08:19.658 --> 01:08:29.702]  And if my fellow men and women can't wake up and get on this same level of common sense as me, I mean, there's a certain survival instinct, folks.
[01:08:31.683 --> 01:08:33.104]  There's a certain survival instinct.
[01:08:33.144 --> 01:08:37.306]  You've got to get as far away from these psychotics as possible.
[01:08:38.967 --> 01:08:44.970]  Anybody that protects pedophiles or wants to mutilate children's genitals, I mean, that's like, run for the hills.
[01:08:49.105 --> 01:08:52.626]  That's run for the hills, and they're taking over.
[01:08:53.126 --> 01:08:54.466]  You're like, hey, what's that noise?
[01:08:54.566 --> 01:08:57.547]  Oh, it's a pedophile army coming to take over your town.
[01:08:57.767 --> 01:08:58.147]  Really?
[01:08:59.027 --> 01:08:59.387]  Yeah.
[01:09:00.047 --> 01:09:01.167]  You gonna stick around?
[01:09:01.187 --> 01:09:06.208]  Hey, there's a bunch of communists coming to destroy your community.
[01:09:06.348 --> 01:09:06.708]  Really?
[01:09:07.529 --> 01:09:08.849]  Are you gonna stick around for that?
[01:09:08.869 --> 01:09:11.269]  Or are you gonna get the hell out of Dodge?
[01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:20.159]   Ladies and gentlemen, I have just been handed A folder of news stories here.
[01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:24.361]  If you're the viewing audience here, you can see it.
[01:09:24.581 --> 01:09:31.784]  If you're a listening audience, I'll just drop this massive stack on the desk and maybe you can hear how big this stack of news stories is.
[01:09:34.265 --> 01:09:58.483]   Whole folder, Ukraine, Neo-Nazis, and what the great crew here has done Is we have compiled here, and this is all mainstream news, leftist news sources, all prior to February 2022, admitting and covering the neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine!
[01:10:02.128 --> 01:10:24.456]  You see, that's what's so frustrating about this is that when you live in reality and you just know how the world works and you just have basic geopolitical knowledge and domestic political knowledge, you see the lives of the mainstream news and you're just stunned, but then you see how the public just buys all of it up, just lops up the propaganda like a pig in slop.
[01:10:27.217 --> 01:10:27.837]  It's just stunning.
[01:10:29.437 --> 01:10:33.982]  And see, the first response is, you assume these people would want to be informed.
[01:10:34.422 --> 01:10:36.904]  You assume these people would want to know the truth, like you.
[01:10:37.585 --> 01:10:38.566]  They don't, folks.
[01:10:38.606 --> 01:10:39.647]  They don't want to know the truth.
[01:10:40.888 --> 01:10:48.876]  They like being lied to, because in their eyes, they view the lies as a political advantage for themselves.
[01:10:49.895 --> 01:10:51.476]  So they go along with all the lies.
[01:10:51.937 --> 01:10:59.062]  They know they can't have an actual intellectual discussion or an intellectual debate or a policy debate or show how their policies or ideologies are successful.
[01:10:59.842 --> 01:11:05.947]  So they buy all the lies and sell all the lies because it's the only way they can continue to exist politically.
[01:11:07.568 --> 01:11:08.268]  So here you go.
[01:11:08.468 --> 01:11:27.033]   I mean, let's just spend a whole segment covering mainstream news articles I mean, the last thing, one of the last things they voted on in Congress, during the Obama administration, was to continue funding Neo-Nazis.
[01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:31.055]  I'm not even kidding you!
[01:11:31.075 --> 01:11:39.378]  2016, one of the last things in that Congress, with Obama, was are we going to continue funding Neo-Nazis in Ukraine?
[01:11:39.899 --> 01:11:40.579]  On the docket.
[01:11:41.658 --> 01:11:43.538]  And then four years later they say they don't exist.
[01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:51.420]  Well, they do exist, and here's all you liars covering their existence for the last 20 years!
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:12:01.242]  So I have to do my best here not to get frustrated at the constant lying from these people, but it's getting harder every day.
[01:12:01.322 --> 01:12:01.962]  So here we go.
[01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:05.723]  Now here's just a basic screen grab.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:11.702]  Of all the different headlines, all the different sources.
[01:12:13.383 --> 01:12:15.904]  Western media before February 2022.
[01:12:16.825 --> 01:12:19.706]  And it's all of them covering the Neo-Nazis in Ukraine.
[01:12:19.726 --> 01:12:23.088]  So we'll just go through this whole stack of news here until you get the point.
[01:12:24.129 --> 01:12:31.533]  And then you can show this to your friends and family that think Ukraine is the good guys and think Putin's lying about getting the Nazis out of Ukraine.
[01:12:31.613 --> 01:12:33.034]  Nope, he's being honest about that.
[01:12:33.094 --> 01:12:34.875]  Turns out everything Putin says is all real.
[01:12:35.055 --> 01:12:35.475]  It's all true.
[01:12:38.757 --> 01:12:40.758]  Except, I guess, when he said he wasn't going to invade Ukraine.
[01:12:40.778 --> 01:12:41.578]  I guess that's the one line.
[01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:47.580]  Ukraine celebrates Nazi collaborator, bans book critical of pogroms leader.
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:49.161]  Times of Israel.
[01:12:50.281 --> 01:12:54.663]  Ukraine... I guess, when I get the date, I'll give you the date too.
[01:12:55.463 --> 01:12:56.383]  Not all of these are dated.
[01:12:56.843 --> 01:13:03.866]  Ukraine makes birthday of Nazi collaborator a national holiday and bans book critical of anti-Semitic leader.
[01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:06.027]  Newsweek, 2018.
[01:13:08.103 --> 01:13:12.606]  Far-right militias in Europe plan to confront Russian forces, a research group says.
[01:13:13.486 --> 01:13:20.070]  And it's all about the Ukrainian Azov battalion, the Nazis, that they're going to confront.
[01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:26.053]  Azov fighters are Ukraine's greatest weapon and maybe its greatest threat.
[01:13:26.574 --> 01:13:30.476]  The Guardian, 2014, covering the neo-Nazi army group.
[01:13:32.583 --> 01:13:35.805]  Ukraine designates national holiday to commemorate Nazi collaborator.
[01:13:35.825 --> 01:13:38.146]  They literally celebrate Nazis in Ukraine.
[01:13:39.427 --> 01:13:42.429]  Neo-Nazi groups recruit Brits to fight in Ukraine.
[01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:46.951]  That's The Guardian, 2018.
[01:13:47.532 --> 01:14:04.468]   Now, by the way, just to sidestep this and bring some other news to this, British individuals, American individuals, and others who have been tricked into going to fight this war for Ukraine are actually realizing they've been lied to.
[01:14:05.509 --> 01:14:10.713]  Here was an individual that posted this on 4chan, I think it is.
[01:14:13.001 --> 01:14:15.483]  I guess I fell for the Azov meme.
[01:14:15.583 --> 01:14:20.647]  Recently graduated with no job so I decided to fly over to Germany and then take a bus to the border of Ukraine.
[01:14:21.068 --> 01:14:27.593]  I told them I wanted to join Azov Battalion and they put me in this unorganized foreign unit with a couple other Americans and mostly British guys.
[01:14:28.013 --> 01:14:38.102]  We did jack for the first few days but flash forward to now and they sent us to the southwest edge of Kiev with nothing but M9 pistols and an AK-47 with half a clip if you're lucky.
[01:14:39.497 --> 01:14:43.340]  We're basically going to be human meat shields for the actual trained Ukraine forces.
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:47.663]  I hear gunshots and artillery less than a mile away.
[01:14:48.864 --> 01:14:51.245]  I was lied to and now I'm going to probably get killed.
[01:14:51.445 --> 01:14:53.987]  Now what did I say a month ago when I all this happened?
[01:14:54.007 --> 01:14:57.730]  I said don't be tricked into becoming a human shield for the new world order.
[01:14:57.750 --> 01:15:00.472]  Don't be tricked into becoming a human shield for the Biden administration.
[01:15:00.792 --> 01:15:03.374]  Don't be tricked into becoming a human shield for the Great Reset.
[01:15:04.471 --> 01:15:12.395]  And then Putin said the exact same thing, and now the people that went over there to volunteer to fight for Ukraine are realizing that's exactly what they got tricked into doing.
[01:15:15.256 --> 01:15:15.816]  We go on.
[01:15:16.637 --> 01:15:17.457]  Washington Post.
[01:15:17.517 --> 01:15:21.319]  Neo-Nazis are exploiting Russia's war in Ukraine for their own purposes.
[01:15:22.660 --> 01:15:23.680]  Oh, I thought they didn't exist.
[01:15:25.621 --> 01:15:26.041]  The Week.
[01:15:26.441 --> 01:15:29.703]  Brits join Neo-Nazi militia in Ukraine. 2018.
[01:15:34.275 --> 01:15:38.597]  Russia steps up pressure on Ukraine to disarm far-right neo-nazi groups.
[01:15:39.637 --> 01:15:40.458]  Moscow Times.
[01:15:40.898 --> 01:15:44.560]  Russia says Ukraine clash shows Kiev not disarming militants.
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.961]  That's Yahoo News 2014.
[01:15:48.001 --> 01:15:49.442]  The militants they're discussing?
[01:15:50.402 --> 01:15:51.403]  The neo-nazi groups.
[01:15:55.544 --> 01:15:59.066]  And so, I mean, folks, it just goes on and on.
[01:16:00.177 --> 01:16:04.018]  And on New Glory to Ukraine Army Chant Invokes Nationalists Past.
[01:16:05.219 --> 01:16:07.019]  Uh, yeah, the Nationalists of their Neo-Nazis.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:13.521]  Uh, 2014, BBC, Ukraine Underplays Role of Far-Right in Conflict.
[01:16:14.001 --> 01:16:14.681]  What far-right?
[01:16:14.821 --> 01:16:16.162]  Oh, the Neo-Nazis they're discussing.
[01:16:16.522 --> 01:16:18.423]  Which Nazis are actually leftists, folks.
[01:16:18.443 --> 01:16:20.643]  I mean, a socialist is a, is, is, that's left.
[01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:22.364]  So, it's not right.
[01:16:22.584 --> 01:16:23.804]  Socialism is a left thing.
[01:16:24.224 --> 01:16:27.285]  So, so, stop sitting here saying, oh, Nazis are far-right.
[01:16:27.745 --> 01:16:29.786]  No, Nazis are left.
[01:16:30.976 --> 01:16:32.817]  Socialism is a left-wing concept.
[01:16:34.158 --> 01:16:42.363]  Just yet another lie, another lie of the mainstream media, another lie of the liberal left, another lie of the progressive Democrats.
[01:16:43.323 --> 01:16:45.885]  Socialism is a left-wing concept.
[01:16:46.285 --> 01:16:51.709]  So if you're going to be mad about Nazis, you need to be mad about your own political ideology.
[01:16:53.730 --> 01:16:56.812]  And I'm not even going to sit here and say Nazis are representative of socialism.
[01:16:58.132 --> 01:16:58.512]  Or not.
[01:16:58.732 --> 01:17:07.575]  I'm just saying, to sit here and say Nazis are far right is an intellectual, ideological lie and falsehood.
[01:17:08.275 --> 01:17:10.736]  Socialism is an idea of the left.
[01:17:11.356 --> 01:17:13.076]  Nazism is socialism.
[01:17:13.516 --> 01:17:15.137]  So Nazis are left-wing groups.
[01:17:15.157 --> 01:17:15.877]  Let's get it right.
[01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:21.559]  I mean, folks, I can sit here and just go through this news all day long.
[01:17:21.599 --> 01:17:28.741]   The point is, They were all covering, look at this, Ukraine conflict, child soldiers join the fight.
[01:17:28.781 --> 01:17:32.925]  You know those videos you see of the little kids posing with the Nazi flags that the left is celebrating?
[01:17:33.206 --> 01:17:34.327]  Yeah, they've been doing that.
[01:17:34.707 --> 01:17:43.273]   The neo-Nazi groups, the left-wing neo-Nazi groups in Ukraine have been using children and the left wing in America celebrates it.
[01:17:43.673 --> 01:17:44.334]  See, that's what I'm saying.
[01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:46.755]  There is no logic on the left.
[01:17:46.815 --> 01:17:47.716]  It's all illogic.
[01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:52.739]  They claim Putin is an oppressive dictator and wants to bring back the Soviet Union.
[01:17:52.799 --> 01:17:53.639]  Okay, so what is that?
[01:17:53.699 --> 01:17:55.140]  So Putin censors free speech.
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.581]  Putin wants communism.
[01:17:56.861 --> 01:17:58.362]  That's what the left wing in America does.
[01:17:58.382 --> 01:17:59.423]  You should be celebrating that.
[01:18:00.123 --> 01:18:01.484]  Nazis want socialism.
[01:18:02.164 --> 01:18:03.345]  You celebrate socialism.
[01:18:03.565 --> 01:18:06.607]  So all of this stuff you claim to be fighting is your own ideology.
[01:18:07.207 --> 01:18:13.559]   Now, you lie about Putin, so that's a different thing, but All this crap is your own ideology.
[01:18:13.639 --> 01:18:16.220]  Nazism, socialism, that's a left-wing concept.
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:21.003]  Communism, oppression, censoring free speech, that's a left-wing concept.
[01:18:22.684 --> 01:18:26.225]  I didn't even get through half the stack of news, folks, but you get the point.
[01:18:27.326 --> 01:18:29.727]  Everything you've been told about Ukraine is pretty much a lie.
[01:18:30.448 --> 01:18:39.913]  The left-wing in America are the true Nazis, the true oppressors, and the true villains, and the sooner we realize that and stand against it, the sooner we can probably save this planet and this country.
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:54.509]  Folks, I have unbelievable clips from day three of the Judge Jackson hearing where she is now openly making excuses for why she protects pedophiles.
[01:18:55.349 --> 01:18:56.310]  And it is incredible.
[01:18:56.430 --> 01:19:03.895]  If this woman is still nominated to the Supreme Court after all of this, we're just a fallen nation, folks.
[01:19:04.435 --> 01:19:06.435]  We're just a fallen nation.
[01:19:06.435 --> 01:19:12.995]  I just can't even deal, man.
[01:19:12.995 --> 01:19:21.806]   *laughs* You've got the Democrat nominee for the Supreme Court defending her defense of pedophiles.
[01:19:24.007 --> 01:19:27.088]  So I'm saying, like, I can't do this seriously anymore.
[01:19:27.748 --> 01:19:32.930]  I have to, like, switch my mindset into straight comedy, because this is ridiculous.
[01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:37.351]  The only response to this is to get flagrantly pissed off.
[01:19:40.247 --> 01:19:49.712]  But I don't want to sit here and just be an angry, ranting, red-faced, blood vessels popping out of my neck, yelling at you all day long.
[01:19:52.173 --> 01:19:58.336]  But I don't know how else you cover the media lying to you about the Hunter Biden laptop.
[01:19:58.496 --> 01:19:59.916]  I mean, folks, you understand.
[01:19:59.936 --> 01:20:13.574]   That's what I'm saying is, you understand that there's photos of Hunter Biden Engaging in lewd sexual acts with what appear to be minors, and it's rumored to be his own family.
[01:20:15.015 --> 01:20:23.842]  You have text messages that have been taken from Hunter Biden's laptop, because I guess it was just queued up, synced up with his iPhone.
[01:20:23.862 --> 01:20:25.964]  A lot of people probably know about that.
[01:20:26.004 --> 01:20:27.265]  They sync up their messages.
[01:20:28.285 --> 01:20:35.451]  Where it talks about him having sexual relations with Natalie Biden, who was a minor at the time.
[01:20:38.048 --> 01:20:43.891]  And so, I see this stuff and I don't even want to dig deeper.
[01:20:44.872 --> 01:20:54.056]  I don't want to know why Ashley Biden is writing about Joe getting in the shower with her and molesting her.
[01:20:55.177 --> 01:20:58.199]  I'll cover that at face value and you decide.
[01:20:58.659 --> 01:21:10.598]   I don't want to know why Hunter Biden is sending messages to family members saying, Don't go in front of counselors and tell them about my inappropriate sexual acts with minors and my own minor family members.
[01:21:12.259 --> 01:21:31.654]  I don't want to come on air, and in my own time preparing for the show, show you the hundreds of images from Hunter Biden's laptop of him abusing drugs, engaging in sexual acts, and some of these with what clearly appear to be minors and it's rumored to be his own family.
[01:21:32.827 --> 01:21:44.689]  And then you read the Biden diary about Joe getting in the shower and molesting his daughter, and you read the Hunter Biden text messages saying, please don't talk to counselors about my inappropriate sexual relations with minors.
[01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:46.910]  I mean, what am I supposed to think about that?
[01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:52.231]  And the media just says, oh, it's all Russian disinformation.
[01:21:52.271 --> 01:21:53.071]  It doesn't exist.
[01:21:53.131 --> 01:21:53.891]  It's not real.
[01:21:54.511 --> 01:21:55.751]  And then Biden gets into office.
[01:21:55.771 --> 01:21:58.692]  And then a year later, they say, okay, the laptop is real.
[01:21:58.532 --> 01:22:04.771]  We lied to you.
[01:22:04.771 --> 01:22:08.371]  This country is in free fall, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:08.371 --> 01:22:18.371]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:22:09.551 --> 01:22:13.452]  We are in free fall, and we really don't even have a president.
[01:22:14.052 --> 01:22:16.353]  We really don't even have a White House administration.
[01:22:17.073 --> 01:22:27.195]  We've got a bunch of goons and cheerleaders and criminals and pedophiles posing as American leaders.
[01:22:27.215 --> 01:22:27.616]  They're not.
[01:22:29.616 --> 01:22:33.497]  They're all blackmailed, they're all compromised, or they're just complete brainwashed morons.
[01:22:35.410 --> 01:22:46.696]  And then, your head is still spinning from dealing with that, and you're like, oh okay, and you finally, your vision is clear again, you've stopped spinning, and then okay, you're able to focus, and what do you see?
[01:22:47.276 --> 01:22:51.398]  Judge Jackson explaining why she protects pedophiles.
[01:22:53.339 --> 01:22:54.940]  And you're like, what?
[01:22:56.861 --> 01:22:57.081]  Wait.
[01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:00.923]  Joe Biden?
[01:23:02.313 --> 01:23:04.455]  Selected a pedophile-protecting judge?
[01:23:04.475 --> 01:23:05.556]  That's what she's known for?
[01:23:07.157 --> 01:23:08.658]  To put her on the Supreme Court?
[01:23:09.579 --> 01:23:10.940]  This can't be a coincidence.
[01:23:13.342 --> 01:23:15.143]  By the way, I just sent the crew the new clip.
[01:23:15.164 --> 01:23:17.065]  Do we have that clip ready to go, guys?
[01:23:19.647 --> 01:23:21.589]  Here is Lindsey Graham.
[01:23:24.651 --> 01:23:25.572]  This is just unbelievable.
[01:23:25.652 --> 01:23:36.869]   I mean, I don't even know how to properly... Here's the nominee for the Supreme Court, Defending her defense of pedophiles!
[01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:38.570]  Here you go!
[01:23:40.312 --> 01:23:41.533]  In comes the internet.
[01:23:42.874 --> 01:23:50.480]  On the internet, with one click, you can receive, you can distribute tens of thousands.
[01:23:51.281 --> 01:24:02.611]   You can be doing this for 15 minutes, and all of a sudden, you are looking at 30, 40, 50 years in prison Good.
[01:24:03.191 --> 01:24:03.852]  Good.
[01:24:04.132 --> 01:24:05.073]  Absolutely good.
[01:24:05.153 --> 01:24:06.374]  I hope you are.
[01:24:06.555 --> 01:24:06.915]  Good.
[01:24:06.935 --> 01:24:08.236]  Allow her to finish, please.
[01:24:08.256 --> 01:24:09.938]  I hope you go to jail for 50 years.
[01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:10.539]  Yes, please.
[01:24:10.559 --> 01:24:15.464]  If you're on the internet, trolling for individuals with children in sexual exploitation.
[01:24:15.724 --> 01:24:17.206]  See, you don't think that's a bad thing.
[01:24:17.306 --> 01:24:18.507]  I think that's a horrible thing.
[01:24:18.527 --> 01:24:20.589]  That's not what the witness said and she should be allowed to finish.
[01:24:21.345 --> 01:24:23.205]  And there's Dick Durbin defending her again.
[01:24:23.265 --> 01:24:25.406]  You know, you gotta wonder what's going on with Dick Durbin.
[01:24:26.326 --> 01:24:28.947]  Why does Dick Durbin love this pedophile protector so much?
[01:24:29.747 --> 01:24:31.488]  What does Dick Durbin do in his free time?
[01:24:31.748 --> 01:24:32.668]  I don't think I'd like to know.
[01:24:33.328 --> 01:24:37.709]  But see, look, if you're being rational about this, and hey, this is a fair debate to have.
[01:24:37.969 --> 01:24:40.270]  Let's have real adult discussions about this.
[01:24:42.130 --> 01:25:05.110]   I can understand the logic of saying, hey, if you're on the internet, And you're browsing through a pornography site or the dark web or whatever, and let's say unintentionally or by mistake somehow, you end up with illicit images or lewd images or God forbid videos of child rape, which is all this is.
[01:25:05.130 --> 01:25:07.411]  There's no such thing as child pornography, it's all child rape.
[01:25:08.312 --> 01:25:13.235]  And let's say there's maybe one or two or God forbid even three instances where this happens to you.
[01:25:15.086 --> 01:25:22.449]  And like you said, oh, it happens in 15 minutes, and you're in a court of law and you say, look, I'm not about this, I did this accidentally, I didn't share it with anybody.
[01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:33.793]  Okay, then maybe you understand, alright, the federal statute here for your child rape videos is 72 months, but you know what?
[01:25:34.334 --> 01:25:35.214]  You made a mistake.
[01:25:35.574 --> 01:25:37.335]  This clearly is not a pattern of behavior.
[01:25:37.475 --> 01:25:40.916]  Then maybe you can say, oh, okay, we'll give you a lighter sentence.
[01:25:41.256 --> 01:25:42.817]  That's not the case here, folks!
[01:25:44.537 --> 01:25:54.483]  Judge Jackson reduced the sentences of pedophiles that took sexual images of their own children and sent them to people on the internet.
[01:25:55.043 --> 01:26:02.248]  People that had hundreds and thousands of files on their computers of child rape that they then sent to other people.
[01:26:02.568 --> 01:26:03.909]  That's a pattern of behavior.
[01:26:05.210 --> 01:26:05.730]  Seriously.
[01:26:06.450 --> 01:26:10.653]  I mean, five years in prison should be like the bare minimum.
[01:26:12.631 --> 01:26:21.174]  If you have a pattern of behavior of watching and sharing and distributing and producing child rape videos, I mean, 10 years minimum?
[01:26:21.234 --> 01:26:25.356]  I mean, like, that's a joke, man.
[01:26:28.057 --> 01:26:28.717]  That's a joke.
[01:26:29.377 --> 01:26:38.760]  But in Judge Jackson's world, in the Democrat world, if you stood on the wrong piece of cement in D.C.
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:54.650]   on January 6th, You should never get out of jail, but if you rape your own daughter, and you take pictures and videos of that rape, and you distribute that to people, and you have other child rape videos that you distribute to people, eh, you should maybe get a couple months max.
[01:26:55.671 --> 01:26:56.811]  That's Judge Jackson, baby!
[01:26:56.831 --> 01:26:57.671]  That's the Democrats!
[01:26:57.991 --> 01:26:59.231]  And they defend it.
[01:27:01.312 --> 01:27:02.412]  And they defend it.
[01:27:05.072 --> 01:27:06.212]  Where are we going?
[01:27:08.133 --> 01:27:09.033]  What are we doing?
[01:27:10.981 --> 01:27:11.561]  But you watch.
[01:27:13.123 --> 01:27:16.465]  This is truly a pivotal moment in American history, folks.
[01:27:17.406 --> 01:27:22.910]  And I would bet, I'd still lean on the side if I'm betting that Judge Jackson does get confirmed.
[01:27:23.010 --> 01:27:30.376]  Though I will say, the Republicans are doing a good job exposing this pro-pedophile judge.
[01:27:31.737 --> 01:27:37.002]  And that definitely, I think, legitimately hurts her chances of being confirmed, but I would still bet she gets confirmed.
[01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:55.586]  This is an important moment in American history and it's not really living up to its own historical, I would say, its own historical prowess here because the media doesn't want you to know that this woman protects pedophiles.
[01:27:56.006 --> 01:27:59.029]  They just want you to know it's a black woman and so you have to love her and support her.
[01:28:00.461 --> 01:28:04.043]  Sure, she protects pedophiles and a pro-pedophile judge, but that's not important.
[01:28:04.063 --> 01:28:05.403]  What's important is she's a black woman.
[01:28:06.084 --> 01:28:10.826]  And so what needs to happen next, they already got her with the, can you define a woman thing, and she says no.
[01:28:12.441 --> 01:28:16.062]  So if a woman doesn't exist, why are you celebrating the first black woman being nominated?
[01:28:16.402 --> 01:28:30.948]  What the next big gotcha question needs to be from one of these Republicans, I hope somebody gets this message to them, I'm surprised it hasn't been asked yet, maybe it will be, is just ask Judge Jackson, how do you feel that the only reason you were selected for this position is because of your skin color?
[01:28:31.946 --> 01:28:37.130]  How do you feel that the only reason you've been selected to this position is because of your gender and your skin color?
[01:28:37.651 --> 01:28:40.173]  I would love to hear her response to that.
[01:28:41.034 --> 01:28:43.175]  So we've already got her as a pedophile protector.
[01:28:43.516 --> 01:28:46.178]  We've already got her that she won't even admit that women are women.
[01:28:46.898 --> 01:28:51.542]  Now let's get her response to what it feels like to only be nominated because of her skin color.
[01:28:51.663 --> 01:28:53.663]  Now that, that would be fun.
[01:28:53.663 --> 01:28:59.663]  [Music]
[01:28:59.663 --> 01:29:01.663]  Ladies and gentlemen, I need your help.
[01:29:02.291 --> 01:29:05.193]  I need your help keeping InfoWars on the air and strong.
[01:29:05.733 --> 01:29:08.814]  I need your help making sure that our mission continues on.
[01:29:09.735 --> 01:29:10.595]  I was born for this.
[01:29:10.755 --> 01:29:11.616]  You were born for this.
[01:29:11.756 --> 01:29:14.257]  And people are really waking up right now.
[01:29:14.297 --> 01:29:20.821]  But we had to build our own infrastructure because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars.
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:25.819]   And now, with Bandot Video getting close to 10 million views a day, we're a platform for
[01:29:25.819 --> 01:29:32.501]   thousands of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge.
[01:29:32.501 --> 01:29:37.139]  And because it's become so successful, it's a catch-22.
[01:29:37.139 --> 01:29:42.779]   Info Wars and Bandot Video have become a mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide.
[01:29:42.779 --> 01:29:48.541]   But the expenses and bandwidth alone are millions of dollars a quarter, hundreds and hundreds
[01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:49.940]  of thousands of dollars a month.
[01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:52.940]  So the biggest sale in Infowars history is going right now.
[01:29:53.007 --> 01:29:54.688]  The Mega Emergency Blowout Sale.
[01:29:54.968 --> 01:29:56.169]  Up to 75% off.
[01:29:56.189 --> 01:29:59.251]  Get incredible products and keep InfoWars as strong as ever.
[01:30:00.513 --> 01:30:06.859]  Zelensky recently described Putin's denazification of Ukraine as laughable.
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:12.464]  And the brainwashed flock of the mainstream media certainly must agree.
[01:30:13.225 --> 01:30:17.789]  They have been told that Nazis wave the American flag and vote Republican.
[01:30:18.189 --> 01:30:21.592]  And the brainwashed flock always believe what they are told.
[01:30:22.373 --> 01:30:31.605]  But those of us still cleaving to our sanity remember that Nazis were members of Hitler's National Socialist Party from the 1930s and 40s.
[01:30:32.466 --> 01:30:38.914]  And not only were there thousands of Nazis in Western Ukraine back then, it is still a big part of their national pride.
[01:30:39.975 --> 01:30:54.763]  Nazi war criminal Stepan Bandera is a national hero, and there are actual Nazi organizations still thriving in Ukraine, including the Azov Regiment, which is now a part of Ukraine's armed forces.
[01:30:55.984 --> 01:31:03.748]  The Nazification of Ukraine is well documented and easily verified, as is the Nazification of America.
[01:31:05.369 --> 01:31:14.734]  During the 1930s, there were many notable Americans who supported the Nazis, such as Prescott Bush, Henry Ford, and Fred Koch.
[01:31:15.394 --> 01:31:16.775]  Banks such as J.P.
[01:31:16.815 --> 01:31:18.496]  Morgan and Chase Manhattan.
[01:31:19.116 --> 01:31:24.399]  Companies such as General Motors, Standard Oil, Shell, and IBM.
[01:31:25.639 --> 01:31:28.241]  Major General Smedley Butler of the U.S.
[01:31:28.281 --> 01:31:35.084]  Marines was asked by these powerful entities to help them install National Socialism in the United States.
[01:31:35.585 --> 01:31:48.252]  I appeared before the Congressional Committee, the highest representation of the American people under its subpoena, to tell what I knew of activities which I believe might lead to an attempt to set up a fascist dictatorship.
[01:31:48.892 --> 01:31:55.375]  I was supposed to lead an organization of 500,000 men, which would be able to take over the functions of government.
[01:31:55.975 --> 01:32:02.578]  And when that plan failed, war broke out in Europe with the support of the banks and these American corporate entities.
[01:32:03.859 --> 01:32:08.641]  After World War II, only about a dozen were brought to justice at the Nuremberg Trials.
[01:32:09.221 --> 01:32:17.765]  The Catholic Church and the Vatican helped thousands of Nazis evade capture via the rat lines, which brought them mostly to South America.
[01:32:18.305 --> 01:32:20.767]  ...where they built an entire town in Argentina.
[01:32:21.828 --> 01:32:27.593]  In Operation Paperclip, the United States secretly absorbed thousands of Nazis into the U.S.
[01:32:27.633 --> 01:32:36.161]  government, where they led the NASA space program and helped pioneer the military-industrial complex, as well as Big Pharma.
[01:32:37.542 --> 01:32:46.248]  Many believe that being a Nazi is synonymous with being anti-Jewish, which may have been true in 1930s Germany, but it's complicated.
[01:32:46.909 --> 01:33:02.919]  Many high-ranking Nazis themselves, including Adolf Hitler, were Ashkenazi Jews, who can be traced back to the notorious Khazars, who mysteriously mass-converted to Judaism about 1,300 years ago in the region now known as Ukraine.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:07.302]  Ashkenazi Jews ran the political Zionist movement in Germany.
[01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:14.647]  And for several years, the Zionists were the only political party allowed to operate inside Germany by the Nazis.
[01:33:15.608 --> 01:33:20.331]  Both the Zionists and the Nazis wanted their own ethnically pure state.
[01:33:21.131 --> 01:33:30.478]  And for years before their final solution, the Nazis helped the Zionists in their efforts to establish the State of Israel within Palestine.
[01:33:31.519 --> 01:33:34.625]  It was far more complicated than mere racial hatred.
[01:33:35.828 --> 01:33:39.174]  Nazism can best be described as fascism.
[01:33:39.856 --> 01:33:41.760]  And fascism is godlessness.
[01:33:43.075 --> 01:33:49.379]  The word Nazi is a made-up slur, but the word fascist can be clearly defined.
[01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:57.085]  It stems from the Latin word fascis, which is a bundle of sticks banded together to form a deadly weapon.
[01:33:57.985 --> 01:34:03.729]  An old-school meme that represents the deadly power of an organized mob, a gang.
[01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:10.715]  When men lack a personal relationship with God, they inevitably band together out of fear.
[01:34:11.515 --> 01:34:17.940]  Submitting to the strongman for a small taste of dominance, they become just another beast in the jungle.
[01:34:18.661 --> 01:34:23.684]  And today, we can clearly see this fascist mentality in all of these godless groups.
[01:34:24.605 --> 01:34:35.513]  The woke, the Satanists, the transhumanists, and the genocidal mass murderers of the Great Reset are all merging together into one giant Foskys.
[01:34:36.634 --> 01:34:39.916]  Godless men and women banded together out of fear.
[01:34:41.077 --> 01:34:43.539]  Fascists serving the strongman.
[01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:47.762]  Spiritually speaking, these are the weakest among us.
[01:34:48.503 --> 01:34:52.105]  And so far, we are allowing them to destroy everything.
[01:34:54.051 --> 01:34:56.313]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:34:57.374 --> 01:34:59.836]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back here live in studio.
[01:34:59.916 --> 01:35:02.658]  Owen Schroer filling in for Alex Jones.
[01:35:03.759 --> 01:35:06.581]  And my next guest is Josh Lekic.
[01:35:06.661 --> 01:35:07.482]  Am I pronouncing that right?
[01:35:07.782 --> 01:35:08.503]  It doesn't matter.
[01:35:08.563 --> 01:35:09.564]  Lekac, Lekac.
[01:35:09.584 --> 01:35:10.164]  It doesn't matter.
[01:35:10.184 --> 01:35:11.045]  Lekac, Lekac.
[01:35:11.085 --> 01:35:20.125]   The point is, he's with us in studio and he's a new victim of the authoritarian, totalitarian,
[01:35:20.125 --> 01:35:23.965]  Democrat Party censorship.
[01:35:23.965 --> 01:35:25.204]  There's no knowing for sure.
[01:35:25.204 --> 01:35:26.923]  He goes on Infowars the other day.
[01:35:26.923 --> 01:35:29.045]  Immediately after that, they ban him.
[01:35:29.045 --> 01:35:30.963]  Is it directly because he went on Infowars?
[01:35:30.963 --> 01:35:31.963]  We'll never know for sure.
[01:35:31.963 --> 01:35:33.685]  I'm sure it had something to do with it.
[01:35:33.685 --> 01:35:36.283]  But it's just the ongoing censorship.
[01:35:36.283 --> 01:35:38.944]  And so, it's the same old story.
[01:35:38.944 --> 01:35:43.605]   They tell you you're guilty of hate speech, but they don't actually tell you what hate
[01:35:43.605 --> 01:35:45.005]  speech you're guilty of.
[01:35:45.005 --> 01:35:48.764]   So just talk about what it's been like because, and you don't have to get too much into personal
[01:35:48.764 --> 01:35:52.123]  information, but you fund yourself with Patreon.
[01:35:52.123 --> 01:35:56.005]  You're an independent show host of Wrong Opinion.
[01:35:56.005 --> 01:35:58.364]  You've got a newborn baby that you just had.
[01:35:58.364 --> 01:35:59.965]  You're supporting that and your wife.
[01:35:59.965 --> 01:36:02.404]  And then boom, they pull the rug out from under you.
[01:36:02.404 --> 01:36:08.605]   Yeah, they get you in the best time possible to make you basically a slave to the system.
[01:36:08.688 --> 01:36:10.829]  You know, they want you completely demoralized.
[01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:16.494]  They want you to bend the knee and they want you to stop what you're doing and stop what you're talking about.
[01:36:16.934 --> 01:36:18.215]  But this invigorated me.
[01:36:18.255 --> 01:36:22.539]  I mean, I'm stronger than ever, although I have to rebuild something from nothing.
[01:36:22.879 --> 01:36:24.880]  I can rebuild something from nothing.
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.001]  These people don't know how to build anything.
[01:36:27.302 --> 01:36:32.945]  All they know how to do is have that HR mindset that is about tearing down anything of value.
[01:36:33.125 --> 01:36:34.606]  They don't know what value looks like.
[01:36:36.157 --> 01:36:37.077]  You just said it right there.
[01:36:37.757 --> 01:36:40.198]  They're talking about their whole build back better thing.
[01:36:40.218 --> 01:36:41.278]  They can't build crap.
[01:36:41.298 --> 01:36:42.218]  They can't build squat.
[01:36:42.238 --> 01:36:47.139]  They just want to destroy and then build their kingdom off of our ashes, off of our rubble.
[01:36:47.599 --> 01:36:49.660]  We're actually doing things to build back better.
[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:51.040]  We had to build back better here.
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:53.080]  We had to build Band.Video.
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:54.861]  You're having to build back better.
[01:36:54.921 --> 01:36:58.261]  Whenever you come out on the other side of this, you're going to be better.
[01:36:58.601 --> 01:37:00.322]  So it's really us that are building back better.
[01:37:00.542 --> 01:37:02.062]  Maybe we should be the ones running the government.
[01:37:02.839 --> 01:37:03.059]  Yeah.
[01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:07.823]  Yeah, I mean, we're the best at building something from nothing.
[01:37:08.163 --> 01:37:20.552]  But the whole point of their agenda is to create serfdom, a new class of people that we thought was stuck in the past, and we had something completely new and better.
[01:37:20.572 --> 01:37:25.795]  Like, hey, it's the Industrial Revolution, now the middle class, and everybody can have prosperity and upward mobility.
[01:37:25.916 --> 01:37:27.056]  Yeah, they don't want that, though.
[01:37:27.657 --> 01:37:28.758]  So they're all fine.
[01:37:28.998 --> 01:37:30.099]  They're all fine on the top.
[01:37:30.859 --> 01:37:35.901]  But it might be penny-wise, dollar-stupid, because it might come back and hurt them later on in the future.
[01:37:36.281 --> 01:37:38.862]  And the thing is, is that this is just making us stronger.
[01:37:38.902 --> 01:37:41.482]  The people who don't quit are stronger than anyone.
[01:37:41.783 --> 01:37:41.963]  Yeah.
[01:37:42.503 --> 01:37:43.403]  Any one of these people.
[01:37:43.463 --> 01:37:45.104]  Well, here's what I realized.
[01:37:45.504 --> 01:38:02.970]   I have friends and family, and I'm sure you're a popular guy, I'm a pretty popular guy, and I have friends and family that really don't care about my politics or don't, even don't like my politics, but When they hear or they learn about the political persecution I'm under, the censorship that I face, they're stunned.
[01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:14.014]  They can't believe that this is going on in America, and you just become an example of reality, and they kind of look at themselves and they say, huh, maybe I am not fully aware of what's going on in my country right now.
[01:38:14.074 --> 01:38:16.856]  Maybe I'm not fully aware of the corruption in my country right now.
[01:38:17.176 --> 01:38:20.457]  I may not agree with Owen's politics, but this isn't right what's being done to him.
[01:38:20.477 --> 01:38:22.638]  I would imagine a similar thing has happened to you now.
[01:38:23.098 --> 01:38:25.980]  Yeah, everyone is asleep at the wheel.
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:29.161]  And they're very comfortable.
[01:38:29.442 --> 01:38:34.825]  The notion, the World Economic Forum notion of you'll own nothing and be happy is correct.
[01:38:34.985 --> 01:38:39.327]  It's a very evil statement, but for me it seems to be correct.
[01:38:39.367 --> 01:38:48.592]  It seems like people in the United States are going along as business as usual, and it's because they've been trained really well to ignore reality.
[01:38:48.633 --> 01:38:52.094]   But that's basically the whole leftist Dogma.
[01:38:52.114 --> 01:38:53.155]  It's to ignore reality.
[01:38:53.195 --> 01:39:01.298]  That's why you have the whole trans swimmer thing, and people are accepting it, and introducing sex to children in school, and people thinking it's okay.
[01:39:01.558 --> 01:39:06.440]  It's because they've inverted reality, and people accept it as the truth.
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:12.023]  The thing is that our side, we are objectively right, and that's not a dogmatic thing to say.
[01:39:12.083 --> 01:39:13.243]  We are tied to nature.
[01:39:13.463 --> 01:39:14.924]  These people reject nature.
[01:39:15.164 --> 01:39:17.385]  They reject reality, and we must keep fighting them.
[01:39:17.685 --> 01:39:18.885]  And that's why they hate God.
[01:39:18.945 --> 01:39:20.846]  That's why they hate the creator of this universe.
[01:39:21.146 --> 01:39:24.668]  Whether you're religious or not, folks, that's really what derives all of this.
[01:39:24.688 --> 01:39:30.510]  They want to kill God so that they can claim they're the creator and in charge of this planet, they're not.
[01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:32.070]  No, and that's how they act.
[01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:33.271]  I mean, look at big tech.
[01:39:33.291 --> 01:39:33.911]  Look at Google.
[01:39:33.951 --> 01:39:35.511]  They think they are omnipresent.
[01:39:35.531 --> 01:39:36.552]  They think they are God.
[01:39:36.572 --> 01:39:39.993]  That's why they're building this metaverse that I never want to go into.
[01:39:40.353 --> 01:39:41.575]  I don't think that's going to succeed.
[01:39:41.635 --> 01:39:42.376]  I think it's ready for you.
[01:39:42.396 --> 01:39:43.417]  You agree with Elon Musk?
[01:39:44.018 --> 01:39:44.939]  Uh, what did he say about this?
[01:39:45.099 --> 01:39:48.543]  He said that he doesn't think the world wants the metaverse, that we're going to reject it.
[01:39:48.763 --> 01:39:50.045]  Yeah, I think he's correct.
[01:39:50.445 --> 01:39:52.127]  I still don't really trust him fully.
[01:39:52.608 --> 01:39:54.230]  Yeah, well I'm just saying with this opinion though.
[01:39:54.250 --> 01:39:55.812]  Yeah, with that I think he's absolutely right.
[01:39:55.952 --> 01:39:59.736]   I'm never going to strap a freaking Whatever to my head?
[01:40:00.216 --> 01:40:01.016]  No, but you know what?
[01:40:01.096 --> 01:40:05.399]  They are strapping those to kids and they are strapping masks to their faces so it's basically training.
[01:40:05.439 --> 01:40:06.039]  That's what they're doing.
[01:40:06.059 --> 01:40:10.301]  They're training people to strap these foreign objects on their face that blind them of reality.
[01:40:10.461 --> 01:40:15.624]  It's the face sucker from alien analogy where you just become something else entirely.
[01:40:15.844 --> 01:40:22.259]   By the way, I remember growing up as a kid And just so people can kind of have an age reference.
[01:40:22.299 --> 01:40:23.580]  I'm not sure how old you are, Josh.
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:24.281]  I'm 32.
[01:40:24.741 --> 01:40:28.524]  I remember growing up as a kid, and we still had, you know, we had the box TVs, right?
[01:40:29.746 --> 01:40:30.606]  Most average U.S.
[01:40:30.626 --> 01:40:34.470]  homes probably had about 28, 32-inch box screen TV, whatever, when I was a kid.
[01:40:36.198 --> 01:40:40.139]  It was well known, and your parents knew this, you don't sit in front of the TV.
[01:40:40.319 --> 01:40:42.280]  It's bad for your eyes, it's bad for your brain.
[01:40:42.740 --> 01:40:47.401]  Now we take this TV and we just glue it right to the front of your forehead.
[01:40:47.861 --> 01:40:49.341]  It's like, what the hell happened?
[01:40:49.581 --> 01:40:55.983]  Yeah, I'm plugged into my phone all day long because for my show, what we do, I kind of have to be.
[01:40:56.123 --> 01:41:01.046]   And I realize that when I try to look out into the horizon, I'm like, my vision is getting worse.
[01:41:01.126 --> 01:41:03.088]  And I just had eye surgery a couple years ago.
[01:41:03.148 --> 01:41:04.189]  My vision's getting worse.
[01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:05.511]  And yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:41:05.551 --> 01:41:10.496]  They're training people to put these things on their faces, on their eyes.
[01:41:11.237 --> 01:41:16.483]  And I'm very curious to see what humans will look like in a hundred years from now.
[01:41:16.883 --> 01:41:19.487]  With this sort of getting closer to the Wall-E situation.
[01:41:19.827 --> 01:41:21.530]  It really is going to be that.
[01:41:21.710 --> 01:41:26.537]  And I mean with the change in diet, the fake meats, and the screens to your face.
[01:41:26.557 --> 01:41:31.504]  But here's kind of what I see happening if this is left untouched, it can play out organically.
[01:41:31.544 --> 01:41:32.485]  What you're going to see is...
[01:41:33.146 --> 01:41:36.890]  And it's mostly going to be, it will be on political lines, it's just the truth.
[01:41:36.930 --> 01:41:39.392]  The political left in America falls for all the BS.
[01:41:40.013 --> 01:41:47.940]  And what I think you're going to see is the political left in America are all going to be either fat and unhappy or extremely malnourished and unhappy.
[01:41:48.401 --> 01:41:54.066]  Either way, it's going to be ugly looking, malnourished, fat, disgusting people that you can just see are unhealthy.
[01:41:54.647 --> 01:41:59.933]   And then you're going to have You know, say, right-wingers or conservatives, whatever, and we're going to be the healthy-looking ones.
[01:41:59.953 --> 01:42:02.836]  We're going to have eyes that can still, you still see a light in them.
[01:42:02.876 --> 01:42:04.157]  There's going to be a glow in the skin.
[01:42:04.177 --> 01:42:05.158]  You're going to be in good shape.
[01:42:05.198 --> 01:42:11.145]  I mean, I think you're really 10 to 20 years removed from, you can just tell what someone's politics are just by looking at them.
[01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:13.206]  You're really almost there.
[01:42:13.807 --> 01:42:14.828]  We're there right now.
[01:42:15.228 --> 01:42:18.951]  Look, the trick is, you guys, make as many babies as possible.
[01:42:19.191 --> 01:42:20.932]  Make them as strong as possible.
[01:42:21.152 --> 01:42:22.994]  And yes, the future is going to be very hard.
[01:42:23.034 --> 01:42:26.376]  It's going to be very hard to navigate, but that's going to make them that much more savvy.
[01:42:26.697 --> 01:42:33.702]  And you're going to be able to be happy about your offspring in a world of unhappy, fat, ugly people.
[01:42:34.282 --> 01:42:36.503]  And, uh, look, yes, we are being replaced.
[01:42:36.563 --> 01:42:37.564]  Our borders are open.
[01:42:37.744 --> 01:42:38.344]  Wide open.
[01:42:38.404 --> 01:42:39.185]  We all know that.
[01:42:39.565 --> 01:42:42.267]  But we still have to wake up every day and we still have to fight.
[01:42:42.807 --> 01:42:46.309]  See, there's certain laws of nature that the left is trying to override.
[01:42:46.329 --> 01:42:47.389]  They're not going to be able to.
[01:42:47.509 --> 01:42:48.070]  For example...
[01:42:49.105 --> 01:42:49.745]  And hey, you know what?
[01:42:49.805 --> 01:42:51.206]  Life is not fair, okay?
[01:42:51.566 --> 01:43:08.113]  Life is not fair, but there's certain things that have always been present in human culture and that will remain in human civilization as long as we're still human, and that's that there's certain traits that are going to be... It's like they write stories about how attractive people have a better success and make more money.
[01:43:08.413 --> 01:43:09.393]  That's not going to change!
[01:43:09.773 --> 01:43:16.016]  People that are in shape, people that are attractive, and you can get more attractive, you just got to be healthy, eat the right things, exercise.
[01:43:16.996 --> 01:43:19.518]  Taller men usually end up in positions of power.
[01:43:20.338 --> 01:43:24.420]  Women with certain physical characteristics and traits usually end up in better situations.
[01:43:24.821 --> 01:43:26.061]  These are just the laws of nature.
[01:43:26.081 --> 01:43:27.182]  It doesn't mean it's good or bad.
[01:43:27.422 --> 01:43:28.423]  That's just a fact of life.
[01:43:28.783 --> 01:43:37.208]  But these people want to override all of it with their butchered faces and their butchered hair and their butchered bodies to try to override the laws of nature.
[01:43:37.248 --> 01:43:40.590]  So yeah, you have kids that are healthy, that are in shape, that are smart.
[01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:46.313]  They're going to win in the next world that we're in unless humanity is just erased.
[01:43:46.593 --> 01:43:50.075]  Yeah, rejecting nature is rejecting God, and you can't fight God.
[01:43:50.135 --> 01:43:53.797]  It's impossible to try to fight God and win, and that's what they're doing every day.
[01:43:53.857 --> 01:43:56.478]  They're doing that, and we see it, and the mask is off.
[01:43:56.578 --> 01:43:59.380]  We see that this is exactly what they're doing, and they're training people.
[01:43:59.420 --> 01:44:01.361]  They're training billions of people to act that way.
[01:44:01.641 --> 01:44:02.542]  It's going to backfire.
[01:44:02.562 --> 01:44:08.425]  It's not going to work, so all you have to do is be as strong as possible, be as happy as possible, and be as fit as possible.
[01:44:09.045 --> 01:44:11.327]  Josh Lekic is with us in studio.
[01:44:11.847 --> 01:44:17.691]  Wrongopinion.net is where you can go to follow him now that he's joined the crowd of the banned individuals.
[01:44:17.731 --> 01:44:18.372]  We'll be right back.
[01:44:19.412 --> 01:44:24.196]  Back in studio here with Josh Lekic, and I'm butchering the name, but he said it's okay.
[01:44:24.216 --> 01:44:24.776]  It's okay.
[01:44:24.956 --> 01:44:25.477]  Doesn't matter.
[01:44:25.517 --> 01:44:26.337]  Forgive and forget.
[01:44:26.998 --> 01:44:33.062]  And we're just discussing this age of censorship, but I want to get back to something we were discussing in the last subject you brought up.
[01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:36.546]  Own nothing and be happy.
[01:44:37.307 --> 01:44:39.628]  To me, that's a hyperbolic statement.
[01:44:40.168 --> 01:44:42.409]  And maybe I'm just speaking for myself, but I don't believe that's the case.
[01:44:42.850 --> 01:44:43.650]  I'll never forget.
[01:44:43.670 --> 01:44:46.272]  And hey, you know what?
[01:44:46.312 --> 01:44:49.774]  People can say this is a bad thing about our culture or a good thing about our culture.
[01:44:49.874 --> 01:44:51.775]  That's fine to have the debate, but I'll never forget.
[01:44:53.342 --> 01:45:06.510]  An old roommate of mine that I was living with, and I was dating this girl from Brazil at the time, and they have a much different culture there, especially when it comes to working, working hours, and how much you put into your career.
[01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:10.212]  And that's okay, different cultures, different ways of life, that's great, move around the planet.
[01:45:11.073 --> 01:45:21.399]  And she asked one time my friend, because me and my roommate were like the same way, like constantly on the go, constantly working, like 15 hours a day, like rarely any time sitting around.
[01:45:22.379 --> 01:45:30.149]  And one day she asked my friend, she was kind of like shrugging because it was like the same thing, and she was like, why do you work so much?
[01:45:30.530 --> 01:45:32.292]  Why are you always working and running around?
[01:45:32.312 --> 01:45:36.297]  And he kind of laughed and goes, because this is America, baby!
[01:45:37.639 --> 01:45:42.844]   And it was such a perfect encapsulation because I will not be happy if I own nothing.
[01:45:42.884 --> 01:45:46.767]  And it's not about owning things and possessing things, like that's my identity.
[01:45:46.827 --> 01:45:49.188]  It's about I want to feel accomplished.
[01:45:49.368 --> 01:45:51.169]  I get endorphins.
[01:45:51.229 --> 01:45:54.311]  I get high out of accomplishing things.
[01:45:54.872 --> 01:45:57.673]  It's not that my possessions are my personality.
[01:45:57.733 --> 01:45:58.834]  It's like I like that.
[01:45:58.874 --> 01:45:59.955]  That's part of our culture.
[01:45:59.975 --> 01:46:01.115]  That's rugged individualism.
[01:46:01.155 --> 01:46:03.237]  That's building prosperity in nations.
[01:46:03.717 --> 01:46:05.518]  I'm not going to be happy if I don't own anything.
[01:46:05.538 --> 01:46:08.380]  I'm not going to be happy if I'm sitting around in a pot eating bugs all day.
[01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:10.021]  That sounds like misery to me.
[01:46:10.481 --> 01:46:14.726]  They're training people, though, and it is working because I know that these people exist.
[01:46:14.946 --> 01:46:18.851]  I lived in Los Angeles for 11 years, and I mean, that's where I met my wife.
[01:46:19.031 --> 01:46:19.391]  Oh, Lord.
[01:46:19.712 --> 01:46:20.493]  But she's amazing.
[01:46:20.733 --> 01:46:22.195]  So, you know, 11 years.
[01:46:22.235 --> 01:46:22.595]  You did it.
[01:46:22.795 --> 01:46:23.116]  I did.
[01:46:23.156 --> 01:46:24.437]  It's like prison time, maybe.
[01:46:24.578 --> 01:46:27.981]  But the thing is, it was it got noticeably worse.
[01:46:28.562 --> 01:46:29.103]  Every year.
[01:46:29.183 --> 01:46:33.906]  As every year passed, it got noticeably worse, and the people became more zombified.
[01:46:34.727 --> 01:46:37.669]  We are a society right now of consumers.
[01:46:37.709 --> 01:46:38.710]  We don't create things.
[01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:41.752]  I mean, very few people right now are encouraged to create things.
[01:46:42.032 --> 01:46:43.253]  It's, what are you consuming?
[01:46:43.333 --> 01:46:44.474]  I have a friend on Instagram.
[01:46:44.494 --> 01:46:50.098]  I mean, he's not a friend anymore, but I'm obsessed with watching his Instagram stories, because it's just consume, consume, consume.
[01:46:50.559 --> 01:46:58.664]   He will watch the thing he's supposed to watch, whatever day it is, And he will tag famous people like, congratulations Sean Penn!
[01:46:58.964 --> 01:47:00.284]  Sean Penn doesn't know you!
[01:47:00.825 --> 01:47:02.686]  Why are you congratulating Sean Penn?
[01:47:02.846 --> 01:47:03.286]  Or care!
[01:47:03.586 --> 01:47:04.446]  Yeah, or care!
[01:47:04.546 --> 01:47:07.468]  But that's the thing, that's where people derive their personality from.
[01:47:07.688 --> 01:47:10.409]  They don't cultivate anything, they consume.
[01:47:10.749 --> 01:47:15.952]  That's like that study that just came out that said people that are obsessed with Hollywood celebrity culture have lower IQs.
[01:47:16.792 --> 01:47:30.224]   I remember Will Smith a few years ago saying that I forget who asked this, but he basically said, why does anybody care what somebody they've never met, never will meet, and will never know your name, why do you care what they think about you?
[01:47:30.504 --> 01:47:33.107]  And that was basically him saying, why do you care about my life?
[01:47:33.147 --> 01:47:34.408]  Why are you so obsessed with Will Smith?
[01:47:34.448 --> 01:47:35.169]  I don't care about you.
[01:47:36.050 --> 01:47:37.912]  Well, I mean, that's the thing.
[01:47:37.952 --> 01:47:40.094]  That's just what it's become.
[01:47:40.355 --> 01:47:41.256]  It used to be kind of...
[01:47:43.385 --> 01:47:51.790]  Segregated, you know, into certain small enclaves within society, but it's literally, everyone has adopted that and I think it's because of the advent of social media.
[01:47:51.850 --> 01:47:56.553]  Everyone sees themselves as the main character of their movie.
[01:47:56.613 --> 01:48:01.496]  Everyone thinks that this is a movie, this is all, but this is reality and you're just not experiencing it.
[01:48:02.116 --> 01:48:07.320]  And you're living your life vicariously through this synthetic world that doesn't even actually exist.
[01:48:08.271 --> 01:48:30.269]  They want you to dive headlong into it, or you're living your life vicariously through your favorite celebrity, and you've bought into this notion that you're never going to make it, you're never going to accomplish anything, so I might as well just follow the celebrity, that makes me feel good, when ultimately that's the biggest downer, that's the biggest depression factor that you could probably voluntarily induce yourself into.
[01:48:30.749 --> 01:48:36.894]  Everything that is real, they try to discourage you from adopting that into your life.
[01:48:37.815 --> 01:48:41.638]  I mean, just look at any piece of media for the last 20 years or 30 years.
[01:48:41.898 --> 01:48:43.479]  The father is a complete idiot.
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:45.761]  Having kids is going to destroy your life.
[01:48:45.801 --> 01:48:47.463]  You're never going to have a social life anymore.
[01:48:47.883 --> 01:48:52.307]  And I think of my social life in my 20s as just a waste of time, you know?
[01:48:52.647 --> 01:48:55.109]  You're just hanging out with the worst of the worst types of people.
[01:48:55.349 --> 01:48:57.711]  Yeah, you get over going to the bar scene or whatever, you know?
[01:48:57.731 --> 01:48:59.933]  It's like your social life is your family.
[01:49:00.733 --> 01:49:06.258]  Exactly, and you're hanging out with the world's best people for yourself, you know?
[01:49:07.279 --> 01:49:07.999]  But they don't want that.
[01:49:08.199 --> 01:49:09.080]  They don't want that for you.
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:11.302]  They want you alone and isolated.
[01:49:11.562 --> 01:49:14.504]  Look, I mean, like banning me from Patreon, that's what they want you to feel.
[01:49:14.684 --> 01:49:17.346]  One way or another, they're going to want you to feel alone and isolated.
[01:49:17.386 --> 01:49:20.749]  They're going to want you to feel like the minority in your own country.
[01:49:21.189 --> 01:49:24.332]  Even though the borders are still open, we are the majority.
[01:49:24.372 --> 01:49:26.774]  We have to stop being the silent majority.
[01:49:26.794 --> 01:49:29.376]  We need to be the loud majority, but we are the majority.
[01:49:29.876 --> 01:49:34.098]  And you know, that's honestly the biggest problem with the American right or conservatives.
[01:49:34.138 --> 01:49:35.619]  And I don't even know what the solution is.
[01:49:35.639 --> 01:49:37.240]  You can't herd cats, as they say.
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:41.022]  But the right has never really been unified on anything.
[01:49:41.182 --> 01:49:42.682]  I mean, we just we don't unify.
[01:49:42.722 --> 01:49:45.224]  We don't have big press conferences together.
[01:49:45.304 --> 01:49:46.824]  We don't do big narrative push.
[01:49:46.944 --> 01:49:49.446]  No, we must reject Nick Fuentes, they say.
[01:49:49.466 --> 01:49:49.846]  Yeah.
[01:49:50.166 --> 01:49:50.526]  Okay.
[01:49:50.566 --> 01:49:54.208]  And so half the people do, half the people don't, and then that becomes a polarizing thing?
[01:49:54.228 --> 01:49:56.449]  Because he said something bad online.
[01:49:56.769 --> 01:49:58.630]  I say bad things online every day.
[01:49:58.650 --> 01:49:59.630]  Like, who cares?
[01:49:59.970 --> 01:50:00.470]  What happened?
[01:50:00.490 --> 01:50:04.752]  Like, I mean, Howard Stern became famous because he was such a rude a-hole.
[01:50:04.812 --> 01:50:08.754]  He pretends like his origins never happened.
[01:50:08.974 --> 01:50:14.520]   He pretends like the first 30 years of his... Yeah, he never did the movie Private Parts about That's not how he came up in media.
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:17.109]  That was in a different universe.
[01:50:17.189 --> 01:50:17.831]  Alternate universe.
[01:50:17.871 --> 01:50:18.353]  Not in ours.
[01:50:18.533 --> 01:50:19.075]  He didn't do that.
[01:50:19.115 --> 01:50:20.079]  He's always been virtuous.
[01:50:21.045 --> 01:50:25.487]  And you know, here's what I think it is for most of the deranged liberal left.
[01:50:26.007 --> 01:50:27.507]  It's honestly just laziness.
[01:50:27.807 --> 01:50:33.570]  I mean, the Bible talks about how, you know, being lazy is a sin, and that's really what it is to me.
[01:50:33.610 --> 01:50:34.910]  It's really just laziness.
[01:50:34.930 --> 01:50:35.590]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:50:36.411 --> 01:50:40.892]  Josh working and doing a show and doing his own thing and then raising a family, yeah, that's tough.
[01:50:41.232 --> 01:50:41.912]  That's hard work.
[01:50:42.012 --> 01:50:42.693]  It's rewarding.
[01:50:43.113 --> 01:50:51.105]   And I think that that's why they're so obsessed with Oh, let's love fat people and let's not body shame and all this stuff.
[01:50:51.545 --> 01:50:58.727]  No, maybe we should be body shaming out of love and support to say, hey, you're going a really bad direction here with your health.
[01:50:59.027 --> 01:51:00.167]  Here's the story I was talking about.
[01:51:01.047 --> 01:51:01.808]  MSNBC.
[01:51:02.328 --> 01:51:05.128]  Why the far right is really into fitness.
[01:51:06.109 --> 01:51:06.629]  When was that?
[01:51:06.689 --> 01:51:07.509]  When was that published?
[01:51:08.223 --> 01:51:09.584]  Let me see if I can get the date on here.
[01:51:09.604 --> 01:51:11.345]  But they always put out articles like that.
[01:51:11.805 --> 01:51:12.866]  You guys pull up this story.
[01:51:12.906 --> 01:51:13.906]  I don't have a date on this.
[01:51:13.926 --> 01:51:18.029]  They also encourage people to masturbate and watch porn.
[01:51:18.389 --> 01:51:19.570]  Or become a prostitute.
[01:51:19.810 --> 01:51:20.951]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:51:20.991 --> 01:51:22.451]  A horrible addiction.
[01:51:23.212 --> 01:51:24.453]  Yeah, no, but that's the thing.
[01:51:24.513 --> 01:51:26.174]  It's all tied to the same thing.
[01:51:26.214 --> 01:51:27.054]  They want you alone.
[01:51:27.074 --> 01:51:29.656]  They don't want you to have any meaningful interaction with anyone.
[01:51:29.676 --> 01:51:31.537]  I mean, that's what the lockdowns were.
[01:51:32.037 --> 01:51:37.365]  It was a social experiment to see if people would comply and would separate entirely from people.
[01:51:37.905 --> 01:51:40.449]  And people to this day are still complying with that.
[01:51:41.010 --> 01:51:41.811]  Here it is right here.
[01:51:41.851 --> 01:51:45.016]  This is actually published yesterday morning.
[01:51:47.016 --> 01:51:49.898]  And they keep changing the headline there, by the way.
[01:51:49.938 --> 01:51:52.821]  When I printed it, the headline was, why the far right is really into fitness.
[01:51:52.881 --> 01:51:56.383]  Now the main headline says, pandemic fitness trends have gone extreme, literally.
[01:51:56.703 --> 01:52:04.249]  Sub-headline, white supremacists' latest scheme to valorize violence and hyper-masculinity has gone digital.
[01:52:04.309 --> 01:52:11.875]  So, oh, if you want to be in good shape and you want to have muscle tone, you're a white supremacist and you're violent now.
[01:52:11.955 --> 01:52:14.617]  I actually think violence is good if the good people do it.
[01:52:15.637 --> 01:52:19.078]  Conservatives... Yeah, I'm violently bench-pressing 300 pounds.
[01:52:20.398 --> 01:52:23.858]  Yeah, I mean, look, conservatives have been too passive and too nice.
[01:52:24.219 --> 01:52:25.219]  They turn the other cheek.
[01:52:25.419 --> 01:52:34.120]  They think that if only they'll be left alone, people will be nice, you know, if they separate themselves from culture and society, people will be nice to them.
[01:52:34.140 --> 01:52:35.440]  Just leave me alone, please.
[01:52:35.460 --> 01:52:36.641]  They want you dead.
[01:52:36.961 --> 01:52:44.402]  Look, taking away my income is them wanting to kill me and kill my family, and I'm not exaggerating, because this is literally how I support my family.
[01:52:44.662 --> 01:52:45.242]  No, it's a death cult.
[01:52:45.262 --> 01:52:46.003]  And that's what they do.
[01:52:46.243 --> 01:52:47.323]  We gotta take a break.
[01:52:47.484 --> 01:52:49.865]  Let's finish up this conversation on the other side because that's what it is.
[01:52:49.905 --> 01:52:50.485]  It's a death cult.
[01:52:50.765 --> 01:52:52.066]  They don't want you to be healthy.
[01:52:52.406 --> 01:52:53.667]  They don't want you to be free.
[01:52:53.947 --> 01:52:55.548]  They don't want you to have a healthy diet.
[01:52:55.948 --> 01:52:57.329]  They hate you and want you dead.
[01:52:57.369 --> 01:53:00.090]  It's this weird suicide pact the left wants you to sign on to.
[01:53:00.170 --> 01:53:00.590]  No thanks.
[01:53:00.650 --> 01:53:00.910]  I'm good.
[01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:01.431]  I like life.
[01:53:02.071 --> 01:53:05.073]  And we've got the host of Wrong Opinion on with us.
[01:53:05.113 --> 01:53:07.674]  He's dealing with the censorship now, Josh Lekic.
[01:53:08.134 --> 01:53:14.438]  And you can follow him, wrongopinion.net is the best place to go to follow his stuff because he's getting banned everywhere right now.
[01:53:15.438 --> 01:53:25.804]   It doesn't surprise me though when you talk about Real issues, and you talk the truth, and you say women are women, that's the kind of thing that gets you banned these days, folks, is saying that women are women.
[01:53:25.824 --> 01:53:26.844]  That's controversial.
[01:53:26.864 --> 01:53:27.565]  You can't say that.
[01:53:27.605 --> 01:53:28.345]  That's controversial.
[01:53:28.365 --> 01:53:32.247]  Yeah, don't judge my gender just because I have a penis and an Adam's apple and a beard!
[01:53:32.447 --> 01:53:33.708]  Yeah, yeah, you can't do that.
[01:53:33.847 --> 01:53:34.847]  How dare you!
[01:53:34.847 --> 01:53:39.646]   But, I mean, I kind of like the Leah Thomas thing, because he's not even trying to sound
[01:53:39.646 --> 01:53:40.646]  like a woman.
[01:53:40.646 --> 01:53:42.287]  You know what, I kind of like it.
[01:53:42.287 --> 01:53:43.287]  I think it's funny.
[01:53:43.287 --> 01:53:46.247]   I'm going to make a prediction, and I hope that, because sometimes I don't like making
[01:53:46.247 --> 01:53:49.606]   predictions because I'm afraid it could alter history and I'd rather just see things play
[01:53:49.606 --> 01:53:50.608]  out.
[01:53:50.608 --> 01:53:51.608]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:51.608 --> 01:53:56.686]   But I will make a prediction, or I'll hope, let's say, that as soon as Leah Thomas is
[01:53:56.686 --> 01:54:00.927]   done swimming as a NCAA athlete, goes back to being Will Thomas.
[01:54:01.142 --> 01:54:01.643]  Absolutely.
[01:54:01.663 --> 01:54:04.504]  He's going to get married and have kids and teach- Still has a penis!
[01:54:04.804 --> 01:54:06.345]  Oh, well, yeah, and he's still dating women.
[01:54:06.385 --> 01:54:07.006]  You know that, right?
[01:54:07.466 --> 01:54:10.628]  I mean, in that interview with SportsCenter, that was a dude.
[01:54:10.948 --> 01:54:12.289]  That was a dude from San Francisco.
[01:54:12.369 --> 01:54:14.490]  Oh, Leah Thomas, the new NCAA female champion!
[01:54:14.670 --> 01:54:18.052]  Yeah, it's a real honor to be up here swimming against my fellow women!
[01:54:18.979 --> 01:54:21.441]  I think he's trolling, and I think that it helps our cause.
[01:54:21.481 --> 01:54:22.041]  I'm not kidding.
[01:54:22.061 --> 01:54:25.023]  So all the conservatives who are outraged, I'm like, no, he's helping us.
[01:54:26.064 --> 01:54:27.265]  I tend to agree.
[01:54:28.285 --> 01:54:34.790]  The obvious instinctual reaction is, this is ridiculous, this is obscene, this should not be going on.
[01:54:34.970 --> 01:54:48.759]  But there has to be a point in this timeline, and I don't know if it is Leah Thomas doing this or not, but there has to be a point in this timeline where men are going to intentionally go into sports as women just to prove a point.
[01:54:49.399 --> 01:54:49.979]  They have to.
[01:54:50.439 --> 01:54:51.179]  It's inevitable.
[01:54:51.419 --> 01:54:55.040]  I don't know if that's Leah Thomas now, but it will be Leah Thomas in the future.
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:55:04.522]  No, I think that they have to do that because I think the only way we can really win is use their rules that they create and just, you know, to our advantage.
[01:55:04.862 --> 01:55:05.682]  I think we should do that.
[01:55:06.042 --> 01:55:10.123]  See, there's always people that are willing to put themselves out there to show an example.
[01:55:10.263 --> 01:55:15.205]   Like, it is embarrassing, and if that's what Leah Thomas is doing, then, you know, I think that's hilarious.
[01:55:15.225 --> 01:55:23.216]  You know what's funny is that conservatives draw the line with women swimming but not Dave Rubin making two babies from... Yeah, that was an interesting thing to follow.
[01:55:23.256 --> 01:55:25.058]  I'm going to withhold comment on that one.
[01:55:25.138 --> 01:55:26.360]  Okay, yeah.
[01:55:26.580 --> 01:55:27.521]  I like Dave Rubin.
[01:55:27.621 --> 01:55:28.282]  He's a good guy.
[01:55:30.164 --> 01:55:33.367]  I like Dave Rubin too, and whatever he does in the bedroom is none of my business.
[01:55:34.529 --> 01:55:48.562]  But it is funny to watch the mainline conservative movement, oh, they ridicule Pete Buttjudge because him and his husband have kids, but then they celebrate Dave Rubin and his husband having kids.
[01:55:48.682 --> 01:55:54.348]  Yeah, but the men swimming as a female, that's where we draw the line.
[01:55:54.948 --> 01:56:02.173]  I would even go as far to say that if, because look, there's always people in human history that put themselves on the line to prove a point.
[01:56:02.273 --> 01:56:02.933]  I've done it before.
[01:56:03.273 --> 01:56:04.314]  I stood in the U.S.
[01:56:04.354 --> 01:56:07.136]  Capitol, this was long before January 6th, I stood in the U.S.
[01:56:07.156 --> 01:56:14.620]  Capitol with a piece of tape over my mouth to show that only one side of the political aisle gets free speech in this country and that's the left wing.
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:20.264]  So they had 45 people out there, whatever, protesting for Trump's impeachment in the Capitol.
[01:56:21.124 --> 01:56:22.305]  And they were allowed to do that.
[01:56:22.846 --> 01:56:25.468]  All day long, they were allowed to protest for Trump's impeachment.
[01:56:26.048 --> 01:56:28.710]  A whole group of people, funded by the Democrat Party.
[01:56:29.051 --> 01:56:34.895]  I go back the next day, in the exact same spot that they were in, with a piece of tape over my mouth, and I get arrested.
[01:56:34.935 --> 01:56:36.517]  So, I knew I was going to get arrested.
[01:56:36.557 --> 01:56:38.638]  That's me putting myself out there to prove a point.
[01:56:38.959 --> 01:56:44.583]  So, if Leah Thomas, or Will Thomas, is doing all this to prove a point, I actually salute that.
[01:56:44.683 --> 01:56:48.547]  I'm sorry for the female victims of this, but this is what the left has done.
[01:56:49.207 --> 01:56:52.108]  Yeah, by the way, that clip of you, that was an insurrection.
[01:56:52.968 --> 01:56:53.448]  Probably.
[01:56:53.628 --> 01:56:55.629]  Me standing there with a piece of tape over my mouth.
[01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:58.030]  You were trying to overthrow the United States government.
[01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:59.210]  How could you?
[01:56:59.690 --> 01:57:00.190]  How could you?
[01:57:00.410 --> 01:57:02.691]  Why am I here?
[01:57:03.031 --> 01:57:08.453]  In three different legal cases now, the Democrats are trying to ban me from Washington, D.C.
[01:57:09.293 --> 01:57:10.433]  Well, I'll represent you there.
[01:57:10.453 --> 01:57:12.834]  I'm going there tonight, so I'll represent you.
[01:57:13.362 --> 01:57:13.863]  Are you really?
[01:57:14.403 --> 01:57:16.745]  Yeah, I'm meeting Elijah Schaffer.
[01:57:16.965 --> 01:57:20.128]  You need to have like some sort of a seance or some sort of a protective tool.
[01:57:20.368 --> 01:57:22.250]  I feel like I'm not going to be allowed to go.
[01:57:22.410 --> 01:57:23.271]  That's my gut feeling.
[01:57:23.351 --> 01:57:23.651]  I don't know.
[01:57:23.832 --> 01:57:24.973]  Especially because I'm here right now.
[01:57:25.333 --> 01:57:28.276]  It really is probably the worst place in America, I would say, is DC right now.
[01:57:28.396 --> 01:57:29.717]  Oh, it's going to have horrible energy.
[01:57:29.777 --> 01:57:34.500]   And I guarantee you that those people Uh, very bad people watch you guys.
[01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:35.981]  I know this for a fact.
[01:57:36.041 --> 01:57:39.382]  I mean, when I was on the show yesterday, then they kept plugging my Patreon.
[01:57:40.123 --> 01:57:43.925]  It was no coincidence I got back to the hotel after and I was completely wiped out.
[01:57:43.965 --> 01:57:50.508]  Oh, I know for a fact that there are individuals that get paid just to watch my show every day and write hit pieces on me like, uh...
[01:57:51.368 --> 01:58:01.293]  For example, you could look at a Timothy Johnson from Media Matters, like, look, oh, I don't know who you are, Timothy, with you and your little creepy pictures on the internet, and Josh Holt, or Jared Holt, or whatever.
[01:58:01.613 --> 01:58:06.976]  Like, yeah, they pay people just to watch our stuff to try to write hit pieces about us, or now try to get us put in jail.
[01:58:07.176 --> 01:58:10.358]  You know what's weird is that they watch you guys all day long, and we haven't red-pilled them yet.
[01:58:10.418 --> 01:58:11.218]  How is that possible?
[01:58:11.258 --> 01:58:12.999]  If they watch, are they really a weird thing?
[01:58:13.059 --> 01:58:15.460]  Yeah, I mean, because... There's one of my monitors right there.
[01:58:15.540 --> 01:58:16.141]  How about that?
[01:58:16.341 --> 01:58:17.381]  That guy looks sane.
[01:58:17.561 --> 01:58:18.562]  They have bug eyes.
[01:58:19.182 --> 01:58:20.863]  They're on too many SSRIs.
[01:58:21.183 --> 01:58:23.105]  They're on heavy pharmaceuticals.
[01:58:23.345 --> 01:58:24.005]  That's the thing.
[01:58:24.045 --> 01:58:29.288]  You can only withstand this kind of world, this kind of reality, by being drugged up.
[01:58:29.929 --> 01:58:31.470]  And also drugged up with the food.
[01:58:31.530 --> 01:58:32.871]  The food is just trash.
[01:58:33.531 --> 01:58:34.492]  It's like all these things.
[01:58:34.552 --> 01:58:35.893]  And that's how you can do it.
[01:58:35.933 --> 01:58:37.634]  That's how you'll be happy when you own nothing.
[01:58:38.308 --> 01:58:45.796]  That's what it's all about is, oh, I got my pharmaceutical pill, or I've got my pornography, so I feel good even though I'm a total slave.
[01:58:46.136 --> 01:58:53.764]  And people like Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab, I mean, like, if I was going to side with them, even to play devil's advocate, I would say, yeah, you know what?
[01:58:54.705 --> 01:59:00.351]  I understand why Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab want to wipe off most of the population, because they've become pretty much worthless.
[01:59:01.243 --> 01:59:01.423]  Yeah.
[01:59:01.863 --> 01:59:02.764]  I'm not taking that stance.
[01:59:02.824 --> 01:59:14.710]  I'm saying if I'm playing devil's advocate, and I'm having meetings with these billionaires, and they're saying, look Owen, because they have, you know they promote this to people, they probably brought it to Trump, and they say, look, why would you want to support these people?
[01:59:14.930 --> 01:59:16.571]  They add nothing to civilization.
[01:59:16.831 --> 01:59:17.872]  They're suckers.
[01:59:18.292 --> 01:59:19.352]  They fall for anything.
[01:59:19.493 --> 01:59:21.534]  All they do is consume and give nothing to the planet.
[01:59:21.574 --> 01:59:22.694]  Why shouldn't we wipe them out?
[01:59:23.034 --> 01:59:23.915]  That's their logic.
[01:59:24.824 --> 01:59:27.445]  But they don't understand that they are the people that they hate.
[01:59:27.525 --> 01:59:29.046]  Like, Bill Gates has man boobs.
[01:59:29.526 --> 01:59:40.891]  I mean, he, if he was jacked, and he ate steaks and that's all he ate, but then he tried to, you know, he'd be a hypocrite and he'd sell, you know, like, eat bugs and eat fake meats and all that, then I'd get it.
[01:59:40.931 --> 01:59:43.452]  But he's a product of his own creation, really.
[01:59:43.472 --> 01:59:44.132]  He's a soy boy.
[01:59:44.312 --> 01:59:46.593]  He is a massive soy boy.
[01:59:47.173 --> 01:59:52.038]  I mean, at least Bezos, like, plays the role of a badass bad guy.
[01:59:52.078 --> 01:59:53.099]  Yeah, he's trying to get jacked.
[01:59:53.239 --> 01:59:55.401]  Yeah, I mean, he's probably doing steroids or something.
[01:59:55.561 --> 01:59:57.763]  Yeah, and they all have blood boys and all that, you know.
[01:59:57.883 --> 01:59:58.063]  Yeah.
[01:59:58.223 --> 01:59:58.904]  Yeah, they do.
[01:59:59.785 --> 02:00:00.566]  They really do, though.
[02:00:00.846 --> 02:00:01.707]  Blood transfusions.
[02:00:01.887 --> 02:00:03.628]  I mean, how is Henry Kissinger still alive?
[02:00:04.605 --> 02:00:06.567]  Yeah, he's still alive, right?
[02:00:06.967 --> 02:00:11.967]  Yeah, I mean, and you look at the Hollywood people too.
[02:00:11.967 --> 02:00:14.367]   It's like, how do they look so young when they're in their 60s?
[02:00:14.367 --> 02:00:17.207]   Now we know they all have surgeries and stuff, but you know there's other stuff.
[02:00:17.207 --> 02:00:19.087]  There's other stuff we don't need to get into.
[02:00:19.087 --> 02:00:22.528]  The ambrosia, you know.
[02:00:23.074 --> 02:00:24.115]  These people are satanic.
[02:00:24.155 --> 02:00:24.655]  They are sick.
[02:00:25.296 --> 02:00:26.897]  All right, here's an example of it, guys.
[02:00:26.957 --> 02:00:27.618]  Let's roll clip 12.
[02:00:28.699 --> 02:00:32.182]  So, you know, Judge Jackson says, I'm not a biologist.
[02:00:32.262 --> 02:00:33.903]  I can't tell you what a woman is, really.
[02:00:34.004 --> 02:00:38.468]  Well, I mean, I'm not a professional basketball player, but I know what a hoop looks like.
[02:00:38.868 --> 02:00:39.949]  I guess I shouldn't say that.
[02:00:40.429 --> 02:00:41.510]  So what is a woman?
[02:00:42.071 --> 02:00:43.372]  The left seems to be confused.
[02:00:43.412 --> 02:00:44.793]  Here's more evidence of that in clip 12.
[02:00:45.093 --> 02:00:45.454]  Watch this.
[02:00:45.815 --> 02:00:50.734]   of being a girl and I've gotten some messages that are saying that I need to
[02:00:50.734 --> 02:00:55.055]   be calling myself a woman and not a girl and I didn't even know that some women
[02:00:55.055 --> 02:00:59.255]   were offended by being called girls so that's really good to know but for me
[02:00:59.255 --> 02:01:05.576]   the word girl feels great because I never got to be one growing up and it
[02:01:05.576 --> 02:01:12.735]   feels very able to make mistakes and growing and changing and evolving
[02:01:10.874 --> 02:01:17.178]  Whereas the word woman feels very strong and confident and powerful and that still intimidates me a little bit.
[02:01:17.458 --> 02:01:18.919]  So I'm gonna keep calling myself a girl.
[02:01:19.139 --> 02:01:19.979]  Hope that's okay.
[02:01:20.179 --> 02:01:20.540]  Love ya!
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:24.862]  So that's a grown man promoting how he pretends to be a woman.
[02:01:25.122 --> 02:01:27.804]  Now, look, I don't care what that guy does in his private life.
[02:01:28.024 --> 02:01:29.205]  Just leave the kids out of it!
[02:01:29.813 --> 02:01:31.734]  Yeah, but this is always about indoctrinating kids.
[02:01:31.774 --> 02:01:33.776]  By the way, I didn't know Ben Shapiro became a trend.
[02:01:33.896 --> 02:01:37.839]  Oh, that kind of actually... That is a little Ben Shapiro look-a-like there.
[02:01:37.859 --> 02:01:39.340]  Yeah, that was a little Ben Shapiro-y.
[02:01:40.220 --> 02:01:42.002]  But, would you trust this person?
[02:01:42.022 --> 02:01:44.564]  I would love to ask the average leftist.
[02:01:45.284 --> 02:01:47.506]  Would you trust this person watching over your kids?
[02:01:47.826 --> 02:01:49.267]  Well, you know what they would say.
[02:01:49.707 --> 02:01:50.388]  They would love it.
[02:01:50.848 --> 02:02:02.322]  Well, but... Oh, actually, true, because they keep offering their kids up as sacrificial lambs to, you know... They're like, yeah, they like hold their kid up like Simba in Lion King, like, mutilate my child's genitals, please!
[02:02:02.883 --> 02:02:04.485]  Yeah, so actually, that's not a good question.
[02:02:04.505 --> 02:02:08.870]  I stand corrected, but these people are absolutely insane, and...
[02:02:09.591 --> 02:02:17.998]  You know, I used to have that libertarian mindset of, I don't care what these people do behind closed bedrooms, behind closed doors, but that's not what it is anymore.
[02:02:18.038 --> 02:02:22.822]  I mean, these people are after your kids, and they are trying to normalize the abnormal.
[02:02:23.002 --> 02:02:23.883]  Hey, normalcy is nature.
[02:02:23.903 --> 02:02:27.225]  That's why they're in the classroom now and bringing in Drag Queen Storytime.
[02:02:27.245 --> 02:02:28.006]  Josh, thank you so much.
[02:02:28.046 --> 02:02:29.607]  Follow him, wrongopinion.net.
[02:02:29.787 --> 02:02:30.088]  Thank you.
[02:02:30.968 --> 02:02:33.050]  I'd like to welcome in Alex Jones.
[02:02:33.851 --> 02:02:34.972]  Thanks, Alex, for being here.
[02:02:36.098 --> 02:02:37.099]  Emerald, it's great to be here.
[02:02:37.119 --> 02:02:44.903]  Congratulations on your great popular show and the great work that you guys are doing in independent media and for you never compromising or backing down.
[02:02:44.963 --> 02:02:52.107]  You know, these very same intelligence chiefs spied on Trump when he was in his campaign, when he was president-elect, when he was president.
[02:02:52.187 --> 02:02:55.209]  We knew this because we actually got documents from the DEA.
[02:02:56.729 --> 02:03:01.528]   in 2017 showing that Trump was being spied on because they had access to
[02:03:01.528 --> 02:03:04.049]  the NSA database and knew that.
[02:03:04.049 --> 02:03:05.509]  And so we first broke that.
[02:03:05.509 --> 02:03:06.689]  So they lied about that.
[02:03:06.689 --> 02:03:09.988]   They lied about Hunter Biden's laptop, even though it was thousands of photos
[02:03:09.988 --> 02:03:15.329]   and videos, and they said that Trump was making it up and the Russians had
[02:03:15.329 --> 02:03:18.969]   basically deep faked all these videos of them smoking crack and having
[02:03:18.969 --> 02:03:21.969]  reported sex with underage girls.
[02:03:21.969 --> 02:03:24.768]  But now, oh, the New York Times says it's real.
[02:03:24.928 --> 02:03:28.489]   And so now we all admit, oh, well, if they say now, now it's real.
[02:03:28.489 --> 02:03:32.329]  Just incredible how much these people lie by design.
[02:03:32.329 --> 02:03:36.408]   It all goes back, as you were saying earlier, to Ukraine, where a lot of
[02:03:36.408 --> 02:03:39.889]   these leftists have been laundering billions and billions of USAID money
[02:03:39.889 --> 02:03:43.929]   that goes to Ukraine that goes right back into their pockets, not just the
[02:03:43.929 --> 02:03:50.929]   Bidens, but the Pelosi's, Mitt Romney's son, dozens of neocons and leftists.
[02:03:50.929 --> 02:03:53.289]  Children, wives, and husbands are getting.
[02:03:54.108 --> 02:03:56.209]  All together, billions of dollars of U.S.
[02:03:56.249 --> 02:03:58.411]  tax money that's sent there laundered back.
[02:03:58.871 --> 02:04:12.880]  So this $13 billion-plus that's going, this $800 million that's going, these billions of dollars that get sent every week now we're hearing about, that's on top of the tens of billions already sent to Ukraine in the last decade since Obama started his big scam in Ukraine.
[02:04:15.455 --> 02:04:21.697]  Yeah, and speaking of that, I'd like to play a soundbite from Daily Mail's reporting on the laptop.
[02:04:21.737 --> 02:04:25.099]  Remember, they had independently confirmed it some time ago.
[02:04:25.139 --> 02:04:36.303]  And in this video, Hunter Biden is confirming that he actually lost another laptop to Russians, and he talks about how much money he'll make if his dad becomes president.
[02:04:36.683 --> 02:04:36.983]  Listen.
[02:04:37.003 --> 02:04:40.885]  I think he's the one that built my computer.
[02:04:40.945 --> 02:05:13.233]   I think the three of them, the three guys that were like, (video playing)
[02:05:13.233 --> 02:05:16.793]   So Alex, while the media was trying to say the laptop was Russian disinformation, there
[02:05:16.793 --> 02:05:21.974]   was videos on the laptop where Hunter Biden was admitting that Russians had acquired one
[02:05:21.974 --> 02:05:25.233]  of his laptops as well and talking about potential blackmail.
[02:05:25.233 --> 02:05:35.233]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:05:27.093 --> 02:05:29.435]  Well, look, that's just him trying to cover himself.
[02:05:29.655 --> 02:05:31.476]  We now know exactly what's happening.
[02:05:31.516 --> 02:05:33.738]  In fact, this all came out a year and a half ago.
[02:05:35.546 --> 02:05:39.826]   I wouldn't look at the laptop myself because it had so much child porn on it that was confirmed,
[02:05:39.826 --> 02:05:43.965]   but the state police, the FBI, Rudolph Giuliani, they looked at it.
[02:05:43.965 --> 02:05:49.546]   Select things that weren't illegal did get released to a lot of folks.
[02:05:49.546 --> 02:05:54.744]   But if you expand on that, the real thing that they were doing when you listen to it
[02:05:54.744 --> 02:06:00.666]   is him talking about Chinese intelligence and him talking about how he works for the
[02:06:00.666 --> 02:06:04.206]   the head of Chinese intelligence and how the head of Chinese intelligence has
[02:06:04.206 --> 02:06:05.006]  disappeared.
[02:06:05.471 --> 02:06:09.674]  And now the FBI is calling his dad asking about Chinese intelligence.
[02:06:09.714 --> 02:06:10.875]  So they have it.
[02:06:10.935 --> 02:06:12.195]  They know they're double agents.
[02:06:12.235 --> 02:06:13.216]  They took Russian money.
[02:06:13.516 --> 02:06:14.677]  They took Ukraine money.
[02:06:14.937 --> 02:06:16.018]  They took Chinese money.
[02:06:16.398 --> 02:06:21.261]  They're not Chinese agents or Russian agents or Ukrainian agents or Saudi Arabian agents.
[02:06:21.322 --> 02:06:26.766]   They are People selling out America as profiteers, the highest bidder.
[02:06:26.786 --> 02:06:28.727]  They are the worst type of scum.
[02:06:28.927 --> 02:06:31.510]  They're not ideologues that think communist China is better than us.
[02:06:31.810 --> 02:06:34.412]  They're not ideologues that think authoritarian Russia is better than us.
[02:06:34.792 --> 02:06:45.521]  They literally are there like a vending machine that you put money into and then you get favors and the sellout of America and American interest.
[02:06:45.841 --> 02:06:49.184]  You give the Bidens 10 million, you literally get a billion in aid.
[02:06:49.804 --> 02:07:01.815]  Same thing with Hillary Clinton and her foundation that raised tens of billions of dollars while she was at the State Department, and we have the emails, the ones she didn't destroy, the ones we were able to get, where they say, okay, how do we talk to her?
[02:07:02.096 --> 02:07:03.337]  $1 million.
[02:07:03.357 --> 02:07:04.338]  $1 million to talk to Hillary.
[02:07:04.638 --> 02:07:08.221]  And then, okay, we want $20 million, and then you'll get what you want from the State Department.
[02:07:08.682 --> 02:07:10.183]  All of this is life in prison.
[02:07:10.664 --> 02:07:11.705]  In fact, it's worse than that.
[02:07:11.945 --> 02:07:12.565]  It's treason.
[02:07:13.326 --> 02:07:15.328]  So this is very, very, very serious.
[02:07:15.748 --> 02:07:19.270]  And that's why the globalists wanted Biden because Trump wasn't compromised.
[02:07:19.290 --> 02:07:20.131]  Trump wasn't corrupt.
[02:07:20.351 --> 02:07:21.432]  You can't buy Trump off.
[02:07:21.692 --> 02:07:22.973]  He's straight up business guy.
[02:07:23.553 --> 02:07:23.853]  Okay.
[02:07:24.114 --> 02:07:34.181]  So that's why they had to steal the election, get rid of Trump is because they needed to get this fully compromised individual in and all the other compromised individuals under him so they could do whatever they want.
[02:07:36.943 --> 02:07:40.005]  So Alex, why is the New York Times now coming out with this story?
[02:07:40.245 --> 02:07:41.506]  There's always a reason to it.
[02:07:43.732 --> 02:07:47.596]  Well, the New York Times is getting ready to basically help the system get rid of Biden.
[02:07:47.797 --> 02:07:50.960]  He's either going to have a stroke or a heart attack or die or be assassinated.
[02:07:51.761 --> 02:07:54.204]  He's only good to them dead or out of office now.
[02:07:55.105 --> 02:07:55.986]  He's deteriorated.
[02:07:56.026 --> 02:08:11.601]   They can blame all the problems on him of the inflation and the gas prices and the war, and then bring in Kamala Harris, who's an even bigger puppet, and, of course, I do want to talk to you about Ukraine because back in October, you actually predicted this war.
[02:08:11.621 --> 02:08:16.145]  In fact, we have a clip from your show where you were talking about this in October.
[02:08:16.005 --> 02:08:20.204]   puppets, they'll do whatever they're told, they're totally compromised, that then they
[02:08:20.204 --> 02:08:24.565]  can flush once they're done using them.
[02:08:24.565 --> 02:08:29.444]   You know, I do want to talk to you about Ukraine because back in October you actually predicted
[02:08:29.444 --> 02:08:30.444]  this war.
[02:08:30.444 --> 02:08:35.364]   In fact, we have a clip from your show where you were talking about this in October.
[02:08:35.364 --> 02:08:37.765]  Let's listen.
[02:08:37.765 --> 02:08:41.043]  But we're looking at a giant war in February right now.
[02:08:41.462 --> 02:08:48.126]  Currently, that's the projections with the top people on the earth who claim they're not with the New World Order Combine.
[02:08:48.966 --> 02:08:50.607]  Is war in February.
[02:08:54.330 --> 02:08:55.610]  How did you know that, Alex?
[02:08:55.750 --> 02:08:56.591]  How did you know that then?
[02:08:58.100 --> 02:09:03.702]  Well, I know a lot of people that work at the CIA and all the people that work in Army Special Operations.
[02:09:04.382 --> 02:09:20.828]  And they said, look for Putin to invade before the end of February, because that's when it thaws and the spring starts to come and the tanks and troops would bog down in that famous Ukrainian black soil that creates so many great crops and is 20% of the world's grain supply.
[02:09:21.428 --> 02:09:30.615]   And then I then I talked to Some billionaires I know, and some people I know that have attended Bilderberg Group, and they said, yeah, how do you know that?
[02:09:30.635 --> 02:09:32.516]  That's super classified information.
[02:09:33.437 --> 02:09:39.162]  And then I was able, through another source, to talk to somebody that actually knows one of the richest people in the world.
[02:09:39.502 --> 02:09:41.464]  And I said, please ask them if you've heard this.
[02:09:41.524 --> 02:09:44.847]  They said, yeah, the stock market's going to go down in late February.
[02:09:45.327 --> 02:09:46.348]  Of course, I don't own any stocks.
[02:09:46.368 --> 02:09:48.289]  I don't ever want to be accused of insider trading.
[02:09:48.689 --> 02:09:53.171]  But I was just told, basically, look for a massive dip in the stock market in February.
[02:09:53.611 --> 02:10:00.815]  So I thought I would just go on air and tell everybody that so that, you know, the general public would be able to have tomorrow's news today.
[02:10:04.306 --> 02:10:09.931]  And Alex, the news today is that Russia is asking the U.N.
[02:10:09.971 --> 02:10:18.678]  Security Council to review documents they say prove the bioweapons lab narrative in Ukraine.
[02:10:18.778 --> 02:10:24.002]  Of course, the corporate media have been trying to downplay that, suggest it again is disinformation.
[02:10:24.303 --> 02:10:26.545]  Do you think Russia has proof of these bioweapons labs?
[02:10:27.568 --> 02:10:28.548]  Well, absolutely.
[02:10:28.608 --> 02:10:30.049]  I don't need to listen to Vladimir Putin.
[02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:32.290]  I don't need to listen to the Russians because they're like any government.
[02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.830]  They lie.
[02:10:33.171 --> 02:10:34.871]  He said he wasn't going to invade Ukraine.
[02:10:35.191 --> 02:10:36.772]  He said he wasn't going to stay there very long.
[02:10:36.852 --> 02:10:39.093]  Once he did, you know, so then Putin's not an angel.
[02:10:39.113 --> 02:10:40.774]  He's not perfect in my view.
[02:10:40.854 --> 02:10:45.116]  But what is reality is our own corporate media in 2003, four and five.
[02:10:48.049 --> 02:10:49.529]  When Obama was just a U.S.
[02:10:49.569 --> 02:11:04.954]  Senator, and then when he was President, he sponsored the bills for over $3 billion to take the old Russian biolabs there that had all these deadly pathogens like black plague, anthrax, you name it, and to weaponize them, and they bragged about this in the Washington Post.
[02:11:04.974 --> 02:11:11.796]  So on my own show, at InfoWars.com Daily, I showed a whole stack of mainstream news articles from 2003, 4, and 5.
[02:11:11.996 --> 02:11:16.578]  I showed them the bill that Obama sponsored and got passed as a Senator from Illinois.
[02:11:17.598 --> 02:11:41.124]  And then I went forward and showed a documentary that's on Infowars.com right now out of Bulgaria that's in English from 2018 where it shows the bioweapon labs with Peter Daszak working there with the Eco Alliance creating gain-of-function and creating gene-edited spike proteins used in COVID-19 that were then patented, of course, in 2016 by Moderna.
[02:11:41.485 --> 02:11:43.465]  So all of this was already hidden in plain view.
[02:11:43.725 --> 02:11:44.986]  Those labs were Soviet.
[02:11:45.266 --> 02:11:45.746]  The U.S.
[02:11:45.766 --> 02:11:46.326]  took them over.
[02:11:46.886 --> 02:11:47.407]  The U.S.
[02:11:47.447 --> 02:11:48.668]  continued to weaponize them.
[02:11:48.948 --> 02:11:49.769]  That's a fact.
[02:11:49.889 --> 02:11:55.053]  Like, Dallas, Texas being in Northeast Texas, or D.C., you know, existing.
[02:11:55.454 --> 02:11:56.194]  This is real.
[02:11:56.254 --> 02:11:57.035]  This is on record.
[02:11:57.315 --> 02:11:59.417]  And they want to gaslight us and tell us it doesn't exist.
[02:11:59.737 --> 02:12:12.248]  Though, the former ambassador and current deputy head of the State Department, Victoria Nuland, came out two weeks ago, as you know, and said, a week and a half ago, sorry to interrupt, and said that these labs are real.
[02:12:12.328 --> 02:12:12.749]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:12:15.219 --> 02:12:17.181]  Yeah, Rubio tried to fix that for her though.
[02:12:17.201 --> 02:12:25.529]  So I just want to clarify for our audience, you're saying that Peter Daszak of Echo Health Alliance, who was tied to the Wuhan lab, is also tied to labs in Ukraine?
[02:12:26.489 --> 02:12:26.930]  Absolutely.
[02:12:29.625 --> 02:12:30.005]  Interesting.
[02:12:30.365 --> 02:12:35.349]  Now, on this, you talk a lot about the global reset, right?
[02:12:35.389 --> 02:12:36.009]  The great reset.
[02:12:36.029 --> 02:12:51.499]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, that's the Alex Jones Was Right interview on Frank Speech with Emerald Robinson, and you can go to Frank Speech TV to see the entire interview, Alex Jones and Emerald Robinson.
[02:12:52.745 --> 02:12:54.728]  The Alex Jones Was Right interview.
[02:12:54.568 --> 02:12:59.507]   We'll be back here fourth hour host Kate Daly, and then I'm back hosting the war room in an hour
[02:12:59.507 --> 02:13:18.847]   You know it's a fact and I'm not bragging when I say it it's just true that info wars is seen by the globalist as
[02:13:18.847 --> 02:13:27.408]   the standard of human liberty as the logo of human populist resistance against their transhumanist
[02:13:27.408 --> 02:13:36.838]   anti-human program And man, our work is really right now hitting the most important aspects of what we've ever done.
[02:13:36.919 --> 02:13:43.701]  So I'm asking listeners now to realize we've got great products, thousands of them, at InfoWarsTour.com.

[02:13:51.363 --> 02:13:52.404]  Don't need me to tell you that.

[02:14:10.677 --> 02:14:14.636]   off at Infowarsstore.com right now. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:14.663 --> 02:14:15.443]  Glad to be with you.
[02:14:15.463 --> 02:14:18.245]  I'm Kate Dally from katedallyradio.com.
[02:14:18.945 --> 02:14:20.846]  And boy, I have a lot to talk about today.
[02:14:21.007 --> 02:14:21.947]  So we got to get started.
[02:14:22.167 --> 02:14:24.228]  I was sent a meme by several friends.
[02:14:24.288 --> 02:14:27.210]  In fact, it happened to be the same meme, which was kind of funny.
[02:14:27.770 --> 02:14:32.793]  And it was one of those memes where we should apologize to the conspiracists, right?
[02:14:34.174 --> 02:14:34.954]  For being right.
[02:14:35.554 --> 02:14:54.425]   And I wanted to say you think you think I interviewed Mallory Millett and Mallory Millett was the sister of Kate Millett who conspired with 15 other horrific women to ruin our culture back in the 70s and the world, that was their goal, with feminism.
[02:14:56.462 --> 02:15:00.966]  She was a mental patient who for days at a time would talk to little green men, okay?
[02:15:01.746 --> 02:15:11.655]  And she was also an atheist, she was a lesbian, and she was credited with bringing in Marxism under the guise of feminism, okay?
[02:15:12.175 --> 02:15:19.922]  And so when she died in 2017, Kathleen Turner and Hillary, everybody was at her funeral, right?
[02:15:20.703 --> 02:15:25.690]  And here she'd been on the planet for 87 years absolutely ruining it.
[02:15:25.751 --> 02:15:29.657]  So her sister goes around and tries to talk about what she did and how she did it.
[02:15:30.396 --> 02:15:32.477]  But it was definitely a conspiracy.
[02:15:32.757 --> 02:15:43.800]  It was a conspiracy of 15 women who plotted together under the group NOW, N-O-W, to go and to figure out how they were going to dominate the world with their new message.
[02:15:44.501 --> 02:16:01.786]   And if you're wondering why we're watching a male swimmer tuck his privates and don a wig and win The best medal in swimming, then you have to go back to Kate Millett and her journey of what she was all about.
[02:16:02.146 --> 02:16:19.691]  I'm not going to be talking about her today, but I wanted to also kind of reference her for a second because her life, what she was about was a total conspiracy with 10 other women to basically bring in Satanism, bring in transgender movement to normalize it.
[02:16:20.251 --> 02:16:24.232]  Instead of being something that, you know, somebody should probably seek counseling for.
[02:16:25.113 --> 02:16:26.633]  And then, of course, she was well-funded.
[02:16:26.953 --> 02:16:28.294]  Well, who was she well-funded by?
[02:16:28.594 --> 02:16:32.575]  She was well-funded by the Rockefellers, the Ford Foundation, and CIA money.
[02:16:32.715 --> 02:16:38.837]  Gloria Steinem even says, hey, CIA money was available and free and they were giving it to us in droves.
[02:16:39.657 --> 02:16:42.658]  And, of course, Gloria Steinem was a paid protester.
[02:16:43.280 --> 02:16:44.701]  That's how it started out too.
[02:16:45.221 --> 02:17:01.852]  So these two women really, if you want to look at our culture, were one of the reasons that they conspired with the right money and they were able to pull off what we're dealing with right now in our history is a cultural revolution in the very worst way.
[02:17:02.332 --> 02:17:02.672]  Okay?
[02:17:03.473 --> 02:17:04.914]  And well-funded plans.
[02:17:05.254 --> 02:17:06.615]  Isn't that what we're always talking about?
[02:17:07.075 --> 02:17:07.235]  Right.
[02:17:09.284 --> 02:17:13.727]  I was asked recently if COVID was the largest lie that we've ever been told.
[02:17:14.488 --> 02:17:16.269]  Well, not really.
[02:17:16.289 --> 02:17:25.776]  I mean, it is because it's worldwide and it's definitely something they all got together on and conspired to do under the direction of the CDC, right?
[02:17:25.876 --> 02:17:32.661]  Which you think, well, why is an American agency like this telling the world what to do and getting some direction from the WHO working with them?
[02:17:33.507 --> 02:17:36.028]  But yeah, it was a very, very large conspiracy.
[02:17:36.228 --> 02:17:40.770]  Actually, there's two conspiracies that we don't really talk about as conspiracies.
[02:17:41.170 --> 02:17:42.351]  And I've always wondered why.
[02:17:42.751 --> 02:17:44.351]  Number one was the Great Depression.
[02:17:44.912 --> 02:17:47.333]  And number two was the polio lie.
[02:17:48.013 --> 02:17:50.594]  And yes, there was a lie about polio.
[02:17:51.294 --> 02:17:52.275]  Not polio!
[02:17:52.655 --> 02:17:55.776]  Of course, you know, there's so much to this story.
[02:17:56.096 --> 02:17:57.977]  And when I come back, I'll go into more detail.
[02:17:58.497 --> 02:18:00.818]  But think about this for a second while we're on this break.
[02:18:01.397 --> 02:18:11.201]  The two things that we don't talk about as being two of the biggest conspiracies that actually affect our lives, money and health, right, are being used right now.
[02:18:12.182 --> 02:18:12.402]  Right?
[02:18:12.942 --> 02:18:15.323]  Didn't we just have a bank failure drill?
[02:18:16.023 --> 02:18:22.466]  And aren't we looking at COVID and other health emergencies and vaccines to save the day?
[02:18:23.106 --> 02:18:27.976]   Isn't it interesting that the Great Depression And polio are never discussed.
[02:18:28.176 --> 02:18:36.604]  In fact, when polio is discussed, it's only discussed in the way that says, Hey, polio, if it wasn't for the vaccines, we wouldn't all be alive.
[02:18:37.585 --> 02:18:40.488]  Oh, I have some problems with that little narrative there.
[02:18:40.908 --> 02:18:42.430]  When I come back, I want to talk about this.
[02:18:42.450 --> 02:18:50.978]  And then I also want to talk about Russian, uh, Russians and Russia and our relationship with Russia through the years, because it's not what we think.
[02:18:52.225 --> 02:18:53.446]  So I'm going to come right back.
[02:18:53.466 --> 02:18:56.387]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host on the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:18:56.447 --> 02:18:57.247]  Be right back.
[02:18:57.267 --> 02:18:59.409]  Hi, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:18:59.449 --> 02:19:00.709]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[02:19:00.889 --> 02:19:07.372]  And so we're talking about two big conspiracies that were never really talked about as conspiracies for some oddball reason.
[02:19:07.953 --> 02:19:10.574]  And number one, we had the Great Depression.
[02:19:11.235 --> 02:19:17.441]  And the reason I'm going back to this, you'll figure this out by the end of this broadcast today, but there's a reason I wanted to talk about this.
[02:19:17.501 --> 02:19:24.247]  And the Great Depression was really a plan to oust the small independent banks in America, was it not?
[02:19:24.808 --> 02:19:31.634]  We had the plan of the Federal Reserve, which is neither federal nor a reserve, and all of a sudden we had this Great Depression.
[02:19:32.438 --> 02:19:36.061]  And the Fed engineered the Great Depression by raising rates, right?
[02:19:36.201 --> 02:19:45.747]  And it just sort of self-destructs just at the right moment to bring about the Federal Reserve as really the savior of the banking industry.
[02:19:45.867 --> 02:19:47.588]  It was a complete overhaul.
[02:19:48.209 --> 02:19:52.832]  Up to that point, we had smaller independent banks that worked independently from each other.
[02:19:52.892 --> 02:19:55.454]  You put your money in the bank, you go get your money out of the bank.
[02:19:55.874 --> 02:19:57.135]  We had a totally different system.
[02:19:58.027 --> 02:20:02.891]  Now all central banks are tied together by what's called the Bank for International Settlements, right?
[02:20:02.951 --> 02:20:03.472]  BIS.
[02:20:03.792 --> 02:20:08.656]  And the BIS or BS is a globalist institution through and through.
[02:20:09.137 --> 02:20:13.581]  And the globalist agenda really seeks to trigger what they call the Great Reset.
[02:20:13.841 --> 02:20:15.643]  Another overhaul, right?
[02:20:15.943 --> 02:20:16.823]   Isn't that What we're looking at?
[02:20:16.984 --> 02:20:27.752]  A financial overhaul, a complete reformation of the global economy and capitalism, which is horrific for us because what it means is no autonomy, absolute tracking, and we know this.
[02:20:27.772 --> 02:20:29.153]  We've been talking a lot about this.
[02:20:30.034 --> 02:20:32.356]  So what did King Fratelot just warn us about?
[02:20:32.936 --> 02:20:42.063]  Well, King Fratelot warned us about a cyber attack from none other than Russia, of course, blaming Russia already that would trigger our bank failure.
[02:20:42.424 --> 02:20:42.664]  Okay?
[02:20:43.453 --> 02:20:47.634]  This is the drill four months ago that they did, not Cyber Polygon back in July.
[02:20:47.814 --> 02:20:48.815]  Not talking about that one.
[02:20:48.875 --> 02:20:50.575]  We all knew that was what that was.
[02:20:51.235 --> 02:20:52.756]  And that's horrific enough, actually.
[02:20:52.876 --> 02:20:58.097]  But what I'm talking about is collective strength, the collective strength drill.
[02:20:58.598 --> 02:21:09.621]  Israel hosts cyber pandemic exercise simulating a cyber attack on global financial systems with 10 countries, the IMF, the World Bank, and of course, the BIS.
[02:21:10.632 --> 02:21:15.556]  Call it collective strength, because they're all going to band together to save banking.
[02:21:15.636 --> 02:21:17.098]  But they're not really going to save banking.
[02:21:17.278 --> 02:21:18.499]  They're going to change banking.
[02:21:19.299 --> 02:21:32.911]  And it's a simulated attack on the financial sector, continuation of global efforts, they said in their headlines, to prepare the public and private sectors for a coming cyber pandemic that would wreak havoc all of society.
[02:21:32.931 --> 02:21:35.033]  Because if you take down banks, you're going to do that, right?
[02:21:35.934 --> 02:21:40.621]  And of course, in that, what they planned to do was to basically give you payments.
[02:21:41.842 --> 02:21:42.503]  Free payments.
[02:21:43.104 --> 02:21:43.745]  Not free payments.
[02:21:43.785 --> 02:21:44.666]  I should say that differently.
[02:21:46.108 --> 02:21:48.572]  They would give you a reprieve from making payments.
[02:21:48.938 --> 02:21:54.038]   And that would be sort of your little payoff, kind of like how COVID dollars were dished out, right?
[02:21:54.038 --> 02:21:56.918]  This would be your payoff for kind of hush money, really.
[02:21:56.918 --> 02:21:59.037]  You know, let's just keep the peasants happy.
[02:21:59.037 --> 02:22:01.998]  They don't have to pay their loan payments for a while.
[02:22:01.998 --> 02:22:05.337]   But if you want your stuff that you've been paying on for years,
[02:22:05.337 --> 02:22:09.817]   and you want it bad enough, you're gonna join the digital banking system
[02:22:09.817 --> 02:22:11.117]  that we have now for you.
[02:22:11.261 --> 02:22:16.625]  Because of course, peasant, it's completely safe now.
[02:22:17.066 --> 02:22:20.929]  Digital money is the way to go because we'll never have a bank failure again.
[02:22:23.607 --> 02:22:23.867]  Okay.
[02:22:24.568 --> 02:22:37.235]  And so in order to get your stuff and get the titles on your stuff that you've been paying off, like your mortgage and your cars, you're going to have to endure the non-payment, that's supposed to be your payoff, and then go into a loan possibly with digital banking.
[02:22:37.755 --> 02:22:41.497]  They had all of this sort of outlined in their little drill.
[02:22:41.717 --> 02:22:44.179]  I love drills because they make me feel cozy.
[02:22:44.439 --> 02:22:45.259]  You know, I love them.
[02:22:45.700 --> 02:22:49.242]  It's like a foreshadowing of what's going to happen, basically.
[02:22:49.962 --> 02:22:51.683]  I wish the people would do that to them.
[02:22:52.378 --> 02:22:58.602]  You know, we always get these drills and I always wonder why we get these drills over and over again telling us what they're going to do and then they do it.
[02:22:59.163 --> 02:23:00.543]  Same with COVID-19, right?
[02:23:01.004 --> 02:23:06.507]  That drill happened in New York a few months before COVID-19 came upon us, right?
[02:23:06.667 --> 02:23:09.189]  The vaccine was already being manufactured sort of thing.
[02:23:09.850 --> 02:23:17.955]  Okay, so coming back to this, I just wanted to talk about this for just a moment because the other thing rarely talked about is polio and this is really important.
[02:23:17.995 --> 02:23:19.416]  Most people don't realize this.
[02:23:20.134 --> 02:23:26.136]  Polio was very, very similar to COVID because people didn't realize at the time that polio only affected 1%.
[02:23:27.777 --> 02:23:35.539]  I know, you probably thought from the headlines and the fear attacks that this was everybody coming down with polio, especially if you were a child, right?
[02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:42.062]  Well, only 0.5 of the 1% were paralyzed and 0.5 of the 1% that died.
[02:23:43.302 --> 02:23:45.643]  So we're looking at a very, very small percentage.
[02:23:46.663 --> 02:23:48.984]  But did you realize this is pretty much with everything?
[02:23:49.437 --> 02:23:50.438]  It's the 1%.
[02:23:51.079 --> 02:23:57.024]  It's always the 1%, and 99.8 or 9% of the time, you're just fine.
[02:23:57.625 --> 02:24:02.830]  So about 25% might have gotten like a flu or flu symptoms, but that was about it.
[02:24:03.891 --> 02:24:09.436]  So it wasn't a major killer, and it didn't maim scores of tens of thousands of people.
[02:24:10.337 --> 02:24:12.960]  And so it was used, and that's really the message.
[02:24:13.966 --> 02:24:15.087]  Polio was used.
[02:24:15.587 --> 02:24:21.391]  It was already waning by the year 1955 and almost gone when they introduced the polio vaccine.
[02:24:21.812 --> 02:24:24.253]  But the vaccine was actually giving polio.
[02:24:24.493 --> 02:24:25.674]  And so the fear ramped up.
[02:24:25.994 --> 02:24:26.975]  Oh, everybody's getting it.
[02:24:26.995 --> 02:24:27.756]  Oh my gosh.
[02:24:28.376 --> 02:24:31.558]  So no one ever asks how the polio suddenly spiked.
[02:24:31.658 --> 02:24:33.520]  And I've talked about this on the show before.
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:38.563]  They just figured it organically happened, but for no apparent reason.
[02:24:38.963 --> 02:24:40.124]  But there's always causation.
[02:24:40.264 --> 02:24:41.005]  There's always a cause.
[02:24:41.744 --> 02:24:51.511]  We were working with brand new antibiotics right after World War II and pharma was becoming king after Hitler because Hitler was using pharma on the Jews.
[02:24:52.271 --> 02:24:54.453]  If you wanted them dead, why not just kill them?
[02:24:54.693 --> 02:24:57.775]  Nope, he was experimenting on them for pharma.
[02:24:58.275 --> 02:25:02.678]  And pharma was ousting all the homeopathic routes that we had always used.
[02:25:02.718 --> 02:25:05.140]  So pharma was going to come save the day, right?
[02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:09.763]  After they were using and killing the Jews and experimenting on them.
[02:25:10.376 --> 02:25:15.440]  So the polio vaccine was now a huge cover for a new vaccine program that they were going to implement.
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:19.402]  And that would become one of the most profitable businesses in the world.
[02:25:19.462 --> 02:25:20.743]  We all know pharma, right?
[02:25:21.123 --> 02:25:22.504]  Then pharma feeds pharma.
[02:25:23.245 --> 02:25:26.647]  So the more shots you get, the more weak your immune system gets.
[02:25:27.168 --> 02:25:29.049]  Now one in three have cancer, right?
[02:25:29.909 --> 02:25:40.058]  They even sent out infected polio shots, 90 million of them to the country at that time in 1955, which they actually admitted later in 2007.
[02:25:41.359 --> 02:25:43.401]  But the fact is, is they sent them out.
[02:25:43.601 --> 02:25:47.124]  They were absolutely, um, you know, infected.
[02:25:47.564 --> 02:25:49.426]  And then of course we had the war on cancer.
[02:25:49.746 --> 02:25:56.251]  So the war on cancer comes up and Nixon declares a war on cancer a decade later, a decade and a half later.
[02:25:56.532 --> 02:26:00.778]   So, The more shots you get, the more your immune system becomes weak.
[02:26:01.179 --> 02:26:05.401]  They lay out a new, very rigorous vaccine program for kids to go to school.
[02:26:05.541 --> 02:26:09.603]  The more pills you take, then you have to take more pills because of the side effects, right?
[02:26:09.623 --> 02:26:10.863]  It's kind of how it works.
[02:26:11.103 --> 02:26:12.104]  Pharma feeds pharma.
[02:26:13.064 --> 02:26:15.405]  There's a meme that I love because it states the obvious.
[02:26:15.626 --> 02:26:20.668]  There's a woman standing there in her 70s and she said, I have two vaccines as she's carrying a sign.
[02:26:21.274 --> 02:26:25.235]  The person next to him is about my age and it says I had 9 vaccines.
[02:26:25.795 --> 02:26:29.076]  The person next to her is from the 80s, right?
[02:26:29.096 --> 02:26:31.797]  Born in the 80s and says I had 14 vaccines.
[02:26:32.537 --> 02:26:36.419]  And then you have a child that says I had up to 98 vaccines.
[02:26:37.499 --> 02:26:39.240]  Now ask yourself the obvious question.
[02:26:40.400 --> 02:26:48.842]  How is the woman that's 70 still standing and alive if in fact she didn't get those other 96 shots?
[02:26:49.783 --> 02:26:50.483]  Do you see what I mean?
[02:26:50.953 --> 02:26:51.593]  She's thriving.
[02:26:51.693 --> 02:26:52.434]  She's doing great.
[02:26:52.554 --> 02:26:53.234]  She's alive.
[02:26:53.254 --> 02:26:55.975]  How did how in the world did that happen?
[02:26:56.775 --> 02:26:59.156]  And so we have to ask the obvious.
[02:26:59.456 --> 02:27:12.400]  So when we finally got to a time with great sanitation, right, as the greatest it's ever been in America, because it was bad sanitation that used to spread disease, we introduced a massive vaccine program.
[02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:13.020]  Why?
[02:27:13.781 --> 02:27:14.681]  Because we believed it.
[02:27:16.526 --> 02:27:21.671]  We always felt like everyone else was getting polio, so we needed to be part of this and do this, right?
[02:27:21.771 --> 02:27:28.116]  So people were flocking to go get these shots, not really realizing that it was only 1% that it was really affecting.
[02:27:28.476 --> 02:27:37.884]  But they're so good at lying, they were able to talk us into the fact that we had to have these polio shots and that we still have to have them, which is utterly crazy.
[02:27:39.045 --> 02:27:42.508]  And so, yes, people can get polio, but it's really, really rare.
[02:27:44.941 --> 02:27:47.723]  Then we had the two world wars that were planned.
[02:27:48.004 --> 02:27:49.325]  We had the new CIA.
[02:27:49.765 --> 02:27:54.389]  We had two big conspiracies that changed us, even though we hardly ever talked about it.
[02:27:54.789 --> 02:28:00.734]  We never talked about the Great Depression changing our banking system forever in the worst way possible.
[02:28:01.355 --> 02:28:01.915]  Well, I don't know.
[02:28:01.955 --> 02:28:04.497]  The Great Reset is going to be another worst way possible.
[02:28:05.418 --> 02:28:10.062]  But then we had Pharma come in and interject a vaccine program that weakened us.
[02:28:13.171 --> 02:28:16.333]  I'll be right back, because I want to talk about some more bigger, fiercer lies.
[02:28:16.152 --> 02:28:20.951]   I mean, come on, all of the things that they give you vaccines for, all the STDs they give
[02:28:20.951 --> 02:28:25.552]   infants, I mean, come on, you can't really believe that saving them from an STD they'll
[02:28:25.552 --> 02:28:28.112]  never come in contact with, right?
[02:28:28.112 --> 02:28:32.191]   I'll be right back because I want to talk about some more bigger, fiercer lies.
[02:28:32.191 --> 02:28:35.592]   We need to talk about these things because the more we realize that government lies,
[02:28:35.592 --> 02:28:37.711]  then the more we can see what's coming.
[02:28:37.968 --> 02:28:42.709]  And this is why we even have false flag alerts now, because people are on to them.
[02:28:43.009 --> 02:28:44.190]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[02:28:44.210 --> 02:28:45.830]  I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:46.551 --> 02:28:48.311]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:28:48.531 --> 02:28:51.753]  And of course, I'm Kate Dally from katedallyradio.com.
[02:28:52.833 --> 02:28:56.974]  Let me just start here with this segment because I know I'll tick some people off.
[02:28:57.014 --> 02:28:58.035]  I usually offend somebody.
[02:28:58.195 --> 02:28:58.575]  Don't worry.
[02:28:59.923 --> 02:29:01.004]  I haven't offended you yet.
[02:29:02.505 --> 02:29:04.287]  You know, we had two world wars.
[02:29:04.587 --> 02:29:06.268]  The CIA got a hold of the media.
[02:29:06.648 --> 02:29:07.589]  We knew this, right?
[02:29:08.390 --> 02:29:09.311]  Or some people knew this.
[02:29:09.611 --> 02:29:15.055]  I think a lot of people were kind of just trying to run their families and work hard and raise kids.
[02:29:15.115 --> 02:29:18.878]  If that wasn't hard enough, we've had government lie after government lie.
[02:29:19.319 --> 02:29:29.727]  But once they took Kennedy out, I think when we didn't, as a populace, now 60% of America doesn't believe the official story.
[02:29:30.250 --> 02:29:35.532]  I mean, a lot of times we're looking at the official story and America's not buying it.
[02:29:35.892 --> 02:29:42.434]  And that should tell you volumes, that a lot of Americans are thinking, like most people do, wait a minute, there's some holes in that story.
[02:29:43.214 --> 02:29:51.157]  But what's interesting is, is now that the CIA owns the media, the field is really wide open to make the lies even bigger, because they can.
[02:29:51.940 --> 02:29:52.360]  They can't.
[02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:53.501]  And they can get away with it.
[02:29:53.901 --> 02:29:54.781]  And that's what's sad.
[02:29:54.821 --> 02:29:56.462]  And this is why we need to wake people up.
[02:29:56.522 --> 02:29:57.743]  And I hate the term wake people up.
[02:29:57.763 --> 02:29:58.903]  I think it's so overused.
[02:29:59.384 --> 02:30:07.988]  But the problem is that there are a considerable amount of people that are still asleep and do not realize they put all their faith in government.
[02:30:08.428 --> 02:30:09.549]  I put my faith in God.
[02:30:10.589 --> 02:30:12.830]  I've got a pretty good conviction on that one.
[02:30:13.551 --> 02:30:18.813]  But they have a good conviction that government's going to run in and save them, even though history does not back them up.
[02:30:19.313 --> 02:30:19.513]  Okay?
[02:30:21.977 --> 02:30:27.042]  When we went to the moon, and I mean it was impossible to do that in the 1960s.
[02:30:27.262 --> 02:30:28.983]  You remember the 1960s, right?
[02:30:29.023 --> 02:30:31.506]  We had rabbit ears on our TV sets.
[02:30:32.787 --> 02:30:39.693]  In the 70s, I was the baby of the family and I was in charge of being the remote control for my family.
[02:30:40.554 --> 02:30:44.357]  Of course, you know, I was the little one so I always got sent to turn the TV knob, you know?
[02:30:46.101 --> 02:30:50.244]  In this time, they said that we had to win this war with Russia.
[02:30:50.545 --> 02:30:58.911]  There was a war with Russia in technology, and I don't even think Russia had that technology, but that's another story.
[02:30:58.931 --> 02:30:59.932]  We'll get to that in just a moment.
[02:31:00.412 --> 02:31:10.520]  But they went to the moon in a foil-wrapped tin can in unpressurized spacesuits in a time when we really had zero technology at that point to do something like that.
[02:31:12.045 --> 02:31:18.594]  The only distance that we had traveled to by 1969 was 400 miles in space and back.
[02:31:19.275 --> 02:31:28.306]  A year and a half before the moon launch, we burned to death three astronauts in a capsule just in a single mishap that I think could have been avoided.
[02:31:29.808 --> 02:31:44.456]  We flew 239,000 miles to the unknown, to the moon, and were able to not only walk on the moon, but then we did it on a single tank of gas in an unshielded spaceship and then flew 234,000 miles back.
[02:31:47.412 --> 02:31:50.753]  Then there was the main ship giving birth to the Lunar Module.
[02:31:51.034 --> 02:31:54.535]  Dave McGowan has wonderful things on this, Center for Informed Citizen.
[02:31:55.295 --> 02:31:58.457]  And he did some great research before his death.
[02:31:58.997 --> 02:32:03.819]  And that untested Lunar Module then flying down making a perfect landing on the surface of the Moon.
[02:32:04.784 --> 02:32:15.286]  And then there was the same untested lunar module blasting off from the surface of the moon without the assistance of any ground crew and ascended 69 miles to attain lunar orbit.
[02:32:15.767 --> 02:32:24.109]  Then there was the ever-reliable lunar module finding, catching and docking with another ship while in lunar orbit utilizing yet more untested technology.
[02:32:24.489 --> 02:32:32.489]   Then there was the command module Shedding the lunar module and then commencing the 239,000 miles home, right?
[02:32:33.109 --> 02:32:44.658]  And we did it with a combination of lethal space radiation, lethal temperatures, a complete lack of breathable air and lower gravitational attraction that produces serious health problems, okay?
[02:32:45.607 --> 02:32:47.628]  And is not compatible with human existence.
[02:32:47.768 --> 02:33:02.213]  And then, we did not have the rocket technology to power such a mission, or the navigation system to guide a journey, or the digital computer technology to control the navigation system, nor did we have the spacesuit technology to protect the astronauts.
[02:33:03.133 --> 02:33:04.554]  Did I mention they were unpressurized?
[02:33:04.794 --> 02:33:04.994]  Okay.
[02:33:06.614 --> 02:33:22.049]  Ah, so, Major, or I should say, Project Manager Thomas Kelly concurred, noting that, and he was Project Manager for Apollo 11, the skin, the aluminum alloy skin of the crew compartment, was about twelve one-thousandths of an inch thick.
[02:33:22.129 --> 02:33:26.073]  That's equivalent to three layers of Reynolds wrap that you could use in the kitchen.
[02:33:26.494 --> 02:33:29.877]  That was what was protecting our astronauts on the way to the moon and back.
[02:33:31.272 --> 02:33:39.655]  And Apollo 11 computer engineer Jack Garman said the computer screens that we looked at at Mission Control, well, they weren't exactly computer screens at all.
[02:33:39.695 --> 02:33:40.496]  They were televisions.
[02:33:41.036 --> 02:33:43.417]  All the letters, the characters, they were actually hand-drawn.
[02:33:44.841 --> 02:33:48.524]  I don't necessarily mean with a brush, she said, but I mean that they were painted on a slide.
[02:33:49.044 --> 02:33:50.525]  But they sure looked impressive.
[02:33:51.686 --> 02:34:00.913]  Every one of those consoles on the floor of that, uh, of, of, uh, that just, it was absolutely ridiculous because it really wasn't doing what everybody thought it was doing.
[02:34:00.953 --> 02:34:02.174]  It just looked super good.
[02:34:02.534 --> 02:34:08.759]  So essentially, says Dave McGowan, essentially an oversized Jiffy Pop container with the brainpower of a digital watch.
[02:34:10.220 --> 02:34:11.340]  And it went off without a hitch.
[02:34:12.241 --> 02:34:13.242]  And returned without a hitch.
[02:34:14.232 --> 02:34:18.113]  Never have launched from an extraterrestrial location before.
[02:34:19.014 --> 02:34:28.837]  And we broadcasted it live on TV and nailed it because we did it right on Sunday night at 9 o'clock when everyone could be glued to the TV at just the right moment.
[02:34:30.438 --> 02:34:31.038]  The odds!
[02:34:32.558 --> 02:34:37.520]  Oh, and every single bit of evidence and tape and documents about the moon landing were actually lost.
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:40.381]  Not 100 cartons, not 50 cartons, all 700 cartons.
[02:34:44.113 --> 02:34:44.453]  Okay.
[02:34:45.574 --> 02:34:50.377]  Gee, you know, I think, you know, we're actually really good at preserving things.
[02:34:50.737 --> 02:34:58.882]  We preserve Judy Garland's shoes from Wizard of Oz, but we don't preserve a single carton of evidence that we actually went to the moon.
[02:34:59.343 --> 02:35:00.824]  Gone forever, right?
[02:35:00.884 --> 02:35:02.245]  Not a shred of documentation.
[02:35:02.805 --> 02:35:07.408]  But because of nostalgia and emotion, we're never allowed to talk about this, or you're a Looney Tune.
[02:35:08.877 --> 02:35:15.278]  I don't know, I just can't ignore the fact that looking back in the 60s, we were able to do all of this, yet can't pull it off in the year 2022.
[02:35:17.859 --> 02:35:26.821]  In 2009, all they had to do was crash something into the surface of the moon so they could get some test studies to see if there were water in the craters, and they couldn't even do that.
[02:35:27.061 --> 02:35:27.521]  Guess what?
[02:35:27.961 --> 02:35:29.001]  The photo footage?
[02:35:31.562 --> 02:35:38.003]  Something went wrong, some sort of mishap, and yes, in the year 2009, and we couldn't even get that, it was supposed to broadcast live.
[02:35:39.172 --> 02:35:42.874]  But we broadcasted live in a time with rabbit ears.
[02:35:43.954 --> 02:35:45.155]  Rabbit ears and no computers.
[02:35:45.375 --> 02:35:52.799]  When it took an entire room to house one single computer, we sent them up in a little tiny tin can.
[02:35:53.119 --> 02:35:53.399]  Okay.
[02:35:54.060 --> 02:35:58.422]  So was the entire thing about Russia, about beating Russia?
[02:35:59.062 --> 02:35:59.642]  Well, yes.
[02:35:59.823 --> 02:36:00.403]  But why?
[02:36:01.482 --> 02:36:04.705]  Was Russia actually even that close to going to space?
[02:36:05.025 --> 02:36:07.688]  Were they as close as we thought they were?
[02:36:08.288 --> 02:36:12.973]  Or did we fabricate that to find a reason to why we had to be challenged, right?
[02:36:13.253 --> 02:36:14.294]  And then come out a winner?
[02:36:14.834 --> 02:36:16.156]  We needed a win at that point.
[02:36:16.576 --> 02:36:17.137]  Desperately.
[02:36:18.057 --> 02:36:21.861]  Was the Cold War a cover for giving Russia technology?
[02:36:23.102 --> 02:36:25.264]  Did they have about the same technology we did?
[02:36:25.463 --> 02:36:28.183]  It wasn't much.
[02:36:28.183 --> 02:36:32.703]   And were we really having a Cold War with Russia or were they just the named enemy at
[02:36:32.703 --> 02:36:33.703]  the time?
[02:36:33.703 --> 02:36:34.703]  Hmm.
[02:36:34.703 --> 02:36:40.023]   And if they were a mortal enemy, why did we sign a treaty with them for the Antarctica
[02:36:40.023 --> 02:36:42.503]  right in the middle of the Cold War?
[02:36:42.503 --> 02:36:43.744]  Seems a little strange, right?
[02:36:43.744 --> 02:36:51.023]   That right smack in the middle of that, 12 nations got together and we agreed on a treaty
[02:36:51.023 --> 02:36:54.983]  for a continent that no one will be able to go and visit.
[02:36:54.983 --> 02:36:56.983]  It seems kind of strange.
[02:36:56.523 --> 02:36:57.564]  I thought they were our enemy.
[02:36:57.584 --> 02:36:58.325]  Hmm.
[02:36:58.925 --> 02:37:00.066]  And Russia and the U.S.
[02:37:00.107 --> 02:37:03.830]  have the only bioweapons labs that house smallpox, interestingly enough.
[02:37:04.471 --> 02:37:08.494]  We share a lot of things, but I'm going to come right back and talk a little bit more about that.
[02:37:09.235 --> 02:37:14.400]  Because there's, I think, a lot more to the Russia narrative and Russia's story than we realize.
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:16.381]  But I've got a lot on this, so we'll come back.
[02:37:16.542 --> 02:37:23.505]   But we really need to think in concrete terms about What we're told every single day by the media.
[02:37:23.605 --> 02:37:24.486]  Well, I mean the government.
[02:37:24.966 --> 02:37:25.586]  I mean the media.
[02:37:25.686 --> 02:37:26.347]  I mean the government.
[02:37:26.627 --> 02:37:27.127]  Be right back.
[02:37:27.187 --> 02:37:28.508]  Kate Daly, your guest host.
[02:37:29.549 --> 02:37:30.149]  Welcome back.
[02:37:30.229 --> 02:37:32.971]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host on the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:37:33.551 --> 02:37:41.496]  And just kind of going back and maybe connecting some dots with Russia, with us right now, because Russia seems to be the big boogeyman.
[02:37:42.537 --> 02:37:47.360]  But was the Cold War a cover for giving Russia technology?
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:48.961]  I'll explain that in just a moment.
[02:37:49.919 --> 02:37:53.903]  Because there is some evidence that that's exactly what we were doing.
[02:37:54.863 --> 02:38:03.170]  And why did we go and sign a treaty in the Antarctica with Russia if Russia was our mortal enemy right smack during the Cold War?
[02:38:03.190 --> 02:38:04.712]  It just doesn't really make sense, does it?
[02:38:05.232 --> 02:38:06.893]  You kind of have to ask yourself these questions.
[02:38:07.474 --> 02:38:11.237]  And so why does... Well, let me put it this way.
[02:38:12.182 --> 02:38:15.905]  Was Russia told to play a part in taking Ukraine back?
[02:38:16.545 --> 02:38:19.927]  Is that why they aren't using the firepower on their own people of Ukraine?
[02:38:20.348 --> 02:38:29.894]  I mean it could be that they don't want to kill their own people in Ukraine and that's why the media is really struggling with the body count because there isn't a severe body count.
[02:38:30.335 --> 02:38:35.298]  They would love for there to be a severe body count but none of the stories are really shaking true.
[02:38:35.498 --> 02:38:47.213]   None of the things that the media is reporting about the whole Ukraine situation is really Until, you know, in a hospital they, you know, 3,000 babies are in a hospital.
[02:38:47.273 --> 02:38:49.754]  Have you ever seen a hospital with 3,000 babies?
[02:38:52.035 --> 02:38:52.215]  Yeah.
[02:38:53.156 --> 02:38:57.418]  Anyway, um, but I think there's so much more to that story that's not being told.
[02:38:57.538 --> 02:39:05.582]  But isn't it also very, very interesting that King Fraudalot announced this week that Russia was going, going to implement a cyber attack on us?
[02:39:07.303 --> 02:39:07.643]  Uh-oh.
[02:39:08.383 --> 02:39:09.544]  I mean, why us?
[02:39:10.310 --> 02:39:13.911]  If you think about it, why would they be attacking us?
[02:39:14.211 --> 02:39:27.375]  Because the whole narrative so far has been Biden king-fraud a lot, saying that we're not involved over there, we don't have bioweapons labs, we're not really even involved, we're just watching, okay?
[02:39:28.016 --> 02:39:30.936]  We didn't coup them in 2014, of course not.
[02:39:31.597 --> 02:39:34.518]  So then why would Russia want to implement a cyber attack on us?
[02:39:34.798 --> 02:39:35.918]  Aren't they at war with Ukraine?
[02:39:36.769 --> 02:39:37.529]  Doesn't make sense.
[02:39:37.969 --> 02:39:45.171]  Their narratives are crashing into each other at the intersection of Bolshez Street and Krakow Krap Avenue is really what's going on here.
[02:39:45.671 --> 02:39:49.532]  And I hope the American people are seeing it and asking all the right questions.
[02:39:50.473 --> 02:39:55.274]  They keep telling us they didn't coup Ukraine, but oddly enough, Russia wants to cyber attack us.
[02:39:56.214 --> 02:39:56.934]  Doesn't make sense.
[02:39:57.175 --> 02:40:00.095]  But yet his intel tells him that this is what's going to happen.
[02:40:00.135 --> 02:40:01.396]  So they're busy making plans.
[02:40:01.856 --> 02:40:06.157]  No, the only thing they're planning to do is to set off a false flag and blame Russia.
[02:40:07.037 --> 02:40:07.377]  Okay.
[02:40:08.077 --> 02:40:11.738]  And Russia did not have a seat at the table like they usually do.
[02:40:12.018 --> 02:40:12.599]  Think about that.
[02:40:12.699 --> 02:40:20.621]  China and Russia usually always have a seat at the table for everything, but they didn't have a seat at the table for the banking failure drill that happened four months ago.
[02:40:21.701 --> 02:40:26.102]  So was that to foment the crazy blame game for shortages and high prices?
[02:40:26.162 --> 02:40:26.863]  Of course it was.
[02:40:27.183 --> 02:40:30.283]  And then bring us into digital currency with the bank failure that's coming.
[02:40:30.524 --> 02:40:35.165]  The same digital currency that through the executive order that King fraud a lot signed.
[02:40:35.405 --> 02:40:35.625]  Okay.
[02:40:36.488 --> 02:40:42.351]  And so, what if we played up the Russian space program to invent a race between the countries?
[02:40:42.391 --> 02:40:48.093]  Let's go back to the space program for a moment, and let's go back into a little bit of history, courtesy of Mr. Fagan.
[02:40:49.054 --> 02:40:52.035]  One branch of the Rothschilds family had financed Napoleon.
[02:40:52.135 --> 02:40:56.817]  The other branch of the Rothschilds family financed Britain, Germany, and the other nations.
[02:40:57.378 --> 02:40:58.739]  And the Napoleonic Wars.
[02:40:59.220 --> 02:41:14.735]  And immediately after the Napoleonic Wars, the Illuminati, you know that entity that liberals think only existed for a couple of years way back when in history, assumed that all the nations were so destitute and so weary of wars that they'd be so glad for any solution.
[02:41:15.075 --> 02:41:18.819]  So the Rothschilds, Stooges, set up what they called the Congress in Vienna.
[02:41:19.489 --> 02:41:34.799]  And at that meeting they tried to create the first League of Nations, but their first attempt at one world government on the theory that all crowned heads of European governments were so deeply in debt to them that they would willingly or unwillingly serve as their stooges.
[02:41:35.139 --> 02:41:39.542]  So the Tsar of Russia caught this plot and completely torpedoed it.
[02:41:40.663 --> 02:41:52.536]  Of course, Nathan Rothschild, very angry, then the head of the dynasty, vowed that someday he and his descendants would destroy the czar and his entire family, and his descendants did accomplish that in 1917.
[02:41:52.837 --> 02:41:58.603]  But a lot has happened since 1917, especially with Russia, and especially with technology.
[02:41:59.594 --> 02:42:08.221]  While Karl Marx was writing the Communist Manifesto, and this is again Fagan, under the direction of the one group of Illuminists, right?
[02:42:08.622 --> 02:42:15.568]  Professor Karl Ritter of Frankfurt University was writing the antithesis under the direction of another group.
[02:42:15.948 --> 02:42:24.514]   And the idea was that who directs the overall conspiracy, if you will, all of these well-laid plans, I think that's what's happening now.
[02:42:24.533 --> 02:42:29.672]   in the two so-called ideologies to enable them to divide larger and larger numbers of
[02:42:29.672 --> 02:42:35.033]   the human race into opposing camps so they could be armed and then brainwashed into fighting
[02:42:35.033 --> 02:42:36.972]  and destroying each other.
[02:42:36.972 --> 02:42:41.853]  I think that's what's happening now.
[02:42:41.853 --> 02:42:45.193]  And destroy all political and religious institutions.
[02:42:45.193 --> 02:42:46.673]  What would they like to do?
[02:42:46.673 --> 02:42:47.673]  That's right.
[02:42:47.673 --> 02:42:51.833]   Go into a one world religion and of course a new world order.
[02:42:51.833 --> 02:42:56.752]   By the way, King Frodelot talked about that new world order this week and said, "Yeah,
[02:42:56.752 --> 02:43:01.314]   that new world order that's coming, we need to get everybody on board for that."
[02:43:01.314 --> 02:43:03.833]  But I thought that was a conspiracy.
[02:43:03.833 --> 02:43:07.752]  Oh, just all the presidents have said it.
[02:43:07.752 --> 02:43:09.234]  Must be a conspiracy.
[02:43:09.234 --> 02:43:10.234]  Okay.
[02:43:10.234 --> 02:43:19.193]   So they absolutely sat down to write and to think out and to really implement communism.
[02:43:19.208 --> 02:43:23.512]  Because then communism would be used as a weapon of war, right?
[02:43:23.592 --> 02:43:24.653]  And a weapon of fear.
[02:43:25.214 --> 02:43:28.277]  And not to say communism was good, obviously it wasn't.
[02:43:28.477 --> 02:43:46.473]   But they actually Implemented, invented what it was and how it would be utilized to then have the sort of blame game, fear game going on where we would always have an enemy, we would always have something that we needed to beat or needed to go to war with, right?
[02:43:46.953 --> 02:43:47.713]  Isn't that how it works?
[02:43:48.393 --> 02:43:52.474]  So according to John Rappaport, I love my friend John because he always puts out some of the greatest stuff.
[02:43:52.694 --> 02:43:58.995]  And he talked about in 1927, Standard Oil of New York, Rockefeller, built a refinery in Russia.
[02:44:01.169 --> 02:44:04.412]  By helping the Bolsheviks put their economy back on their feet, right?
[02:44:04.792 --> 02:44:11.299]  So, Professor Anthony Sutton said this was the first United States investment in Russia since the revolution.
[02:44:11.839 --> 02:44:25.372]  Shortly thereafter, Standard Oil of New York and its subsidiary, Vacuum Oil, concluded a deal to market Soviet oil in European countries and it was reported that the loan of $75 million to the Bolsheviks was arranged.
[02:44:26.053 --> 02:44:31.856]  So wherever Standard Oil would go, Chase National Bank was sure to follow.
[02:44:32.317 --> 02:44:32.897]  Love Chase!
[02:44:33.417 --> 02:44:40.481]  The Rockefeller's Chase Bank was later merged with the Warburg's Manhattan Bank to form the present Chase Manhattan Bank.
[02:44:41.142 --> 02:44:51.607]  And in order to rescue the Bolsheviks, we were supposedly an archenemy of, the Chase National Bank was instrumental in establishing the American-Russian Chamber of Commerce in 1922.
[02:44:53.462 --> 02:44:59.324]  The Rockefeller's Chase National Bank was also involved in selling Bolshevik bonds in the United States in 1928.
[02:45:00.985 --> 02:45:08.787]  And the Soviet government had been given United States Treasury funds by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks.
[02:45:09.228 --> 02:45:12.309]  Of course, again, acting through Chase Bank.
[02:45:14.249 --> 02:45:18.791]  But the Rockefellers apparently were not alone in financing the Communist arm.
[02:45:19.554 --> 02:45:21.455]  Of this conspiracy.
[02:45:21.775 --> 02:45:24.636]  And a conspiracy is a well-laid plan.
[02:45:25.016 --> 02:45:25.856]  Boy, they have a lot of them.
[02:45:26.376 --> 02:45:40.301]  According to Professor Sutton, there's a report in the State Department file that names Kuhn Loeb & Company, the long-established, important financial house in New York, as the financier of the Russians' first five-year plan.
[02:45:40.641 --> 02:45:41.561]  And you can see the U.S.
[02:45:41.581 --> 02:45:43.322]  State Department decimal file on that.
[02:45:44.147 --> 02:45:44.407]  Hmm.
[02:45:45.027 --> 02:45:53.671]  Why would the Rockefellers and Armand Hammer and others take the lead in such a covert transfer program over the course of decades?
[02:45:54.371 --> 02:45:56.912]  Well, money and profits on one level.
[02:45:57.252 --> 02:45:58.513]  Isn't that always how it works?
[02:45:59.153 --> 02:46:06.416]  And on another level, bolstering the Russian communist socialist state was part of their plan.
[02:46:06.676 --> 02:46:12.738]  The Rockefeller plan to expand socialism in many forms all across the countries.
[02:46:13.331 --> 02:46:14.271]  All over the world.
[02:46:15.331 --> 02:46:31.355]  It's always funny to me that people can read the Bible, read the book of Revelations, especially Christians, and then try to mock conspiracy theorists for saying this is the direction we're going in.
[02:46:32.015 --> 02:46:33.755]  How do we get from here to there?
[02:46:34.356 --> 02:46:39.157]  How do we get from here to there without all of that taking place?
[02:46:39.737 --> 02:46:41.177]  Do they think it takes place in a day?
[02:46:42.062 --> 02:46:50.308]  You know, it's so funny to me that we can't recognize that major conspiracies and plans have been laid and set since the dawn of time.
[02:46:51.309 --> 02:46:54.291]  And especially us Christians out there should realize that.
[02:46:54.531 --> 02:46:56.412]  We should be the ones that really get it.
[02:46:56.973 --> 02:47:03.838]  But isn't it odd and funny that you actually get the mocking a lot from Christians?
[02:47:04.038 --> 02:47:06.139]  And so, do they believe the book or not?
[02:47:06.159 --> 02:47:07.861]  It's always a question.
[02:47:08.041 --> 02:47:09.562]  Anyway, I'll be right back.
[02:47:09.782 --> 02:47:10.943]  I'm Kay Dally, your guest host.
[02:47:12.213 --> 02:47:13.974]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.034 --> 02:47:17.277]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:47:17.917 --> 02:47:37.812]  You know, tying all of this together, it's kind of interesting, isn't it, when you look at some really well-laid plans to involve Russia in many, many plans and types of funding and banks and everything else that we were doing all along during the supposed Cold War as well.
[02:47:38.789 --> 02:47:42.652]  But I thought a Cold War meant we were at war, really, right?
[02:47:42.672 --> 02:47:43.893]  Not so much.
[02:47:44.394 --> 02:47:53.041]  Anyway, why would the Rockefellers, Armand Haber, and others take the lead in this covert transfer program, right, over the course of the decades?
[02:47:54.162 --> 02:47:59.602]   You've got money, you've got profits, okay, says John Rappaport, but on another level,
[02:47:59.602 --> 02:48:04.721]   bolstering the Russian communist socialist state was really what they were all,
[02:48:04.721 --> 02:48:06.561]  well, that's what they were after.
[02:48:06.561 --> 02:48:08.181]  You've got to have the enemy.
[02:48:08.181 --> 02:48:10.101]  It doesn't mean the enemy doesn't exist.
[02:48:10.101 --> 02:48:14.942]   It means that you create the enemy, you conjure up the enemy,
[02:48:14.942 --> 02:48:19.582]   and the enemy does what the enemy does, but we wanted to use that enemy
[02:48:19.582 --> 02:48:21.602]  as really kind of like a weapon of war.
[02:48:21.602 --> 02:48:26.082]   So we're supplying Russia with all of this vital technology that it lacked,
[02:48:26.082 --> 02:48:28.582]  and that eventually produced the Cold War.
[02:48:28.371 --> 02:48:33.312]  And that mighty standoff really was this gigantic moneymaker for the banksters.
[02:48:33.772 --> 02:48:40.634]  And it also created a threat to Europe, which justified the rise of... European Union.
[02:48:41.354 --> 02:48:41.594]  Yeah.
[02:48:41.934 --> 02:48:44.115]  See, they would love to regionalize all of us.
[02:48:44.375 --> 02:48:52.233]   They'd love for us and North America, Canada and Mexico to be a region too. They'd like to have six,
[02:48:52.233 --> 02:48:58.253]   basically six regions instead of the sovereignty of nations. So the European Union, that
[02:48:58.253 --> 02:49:04.862]   really gave rise at that point, was more of the causation or the catalyst for the European
[02:49:04.862 --> 02:49:09.983]   Union to come about. So the individual states, countries would then lose their
[02:49:09.983 --> 02:49:15.653]   sovereignty to the decision maker called the European Union. It's kind of like a little test run for
[02:49:15.653 --> 02:49:16.452]  one world order.
[02:49:17.065 --> 02:49:28.234]  And another major Rockefeller, CFR, Bilderberg plan was to extend this covert agenda into the socialism, globalism, and the EU is the regional face of globalism.
[02:49:28.254 --> 02:49:29.775]  This is why it's so loved.
[02:49:29.915 --> 02:49:30.395]  They love it.
[02:49:31.096 --> 02:49:35.259]  And in Korea, we have direct killing of Americans, right, with Soviet weapons.
[02:49:35.599 --> 02:49:39.963]  And the American casualty rule in the Korean War was 33,000 killed, 103,000 wounded.
[02:49:43.145 --> 02:50:02.098]  And a 130,000 man North Korean Army, which crossed the South Korean border in June of 1950, was trained, supported, and equipped by the Soviet Union, and included a brigade of Soviet T-34 medium tanks with U.S.
[02:50:02.138 --> 02:50:03.139]  Christie suspensions.
[02:50:03.857 --> 02:50:09.922]  The artillery tractors were direct metric copies of the caterpillar tractors that we have here.
[02:50:10.482 --> 02:50:14.145]  The trucks came from Henry Ford Gorky plant or the ZIL plant.
[02:50:14.505 --> 02:50:20.369]  The North Korean Air Force had 183 Yak planes built in plants with U.S.
[02:50:20.469 --> 02:50:21.430]  Lend-Lease equipment.
[02:50:23.314 --> 02:50:24.594]  Seems cozy, does it not?
[02:50:24.654 --> 02:50:26.635]  I just get the cozies when I'm reading this.
[02:50:26.915 --> 02:50:37.878]  The Yaks were later replaced by MIG-15s powered by the Russian copies of the Rolls-Royce jet engines sold to the Soviet Union in 1947.
[02:50:38.778 --> 02:50:44.040]  Who were the government officials responsible for this transfer of known military technology?
[02:50:44.580 --> 02:50:52.645]   The concept originally came from National Security Advisor, who's 200 years old, Henry Well, with us.
[02:50:53.025 --> 02:50:53.666]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:50:54.067 --> 02:51:05.845]  Anyway, who reportedly sold President Nixon on the idea that giving military technology to the Soviets would temper their global territorial ambitions.
[02:51:06.351 --> 02:51:06.771]  Hmm.
[02:51:07.451 --> 02:51:26.737]  And not least that Henry had been paid a paid family employee of the Rockefellers since 1958 and has served as the International Advisory Committee Chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, a Rockefeller concern, our biggest liaison to China, and also every single president that's ever run for office needs to get his permission.
[02:51:27.637 --> 02:51:28.037]  That's fun.
[02:51:28.695 --> 02:51:38.365]  Anyway, the Arm and Hammer and Occidental Petroleum would supply the Soviets with massive plants that can quickly be converted to explosive manufacturing.
[02:51:38.886 --> 02:51:39.907]  Well, that's no surprise.
[02:51:40.267 --> 02:51:44.252]  And Soviet tractor plants were established in the early 30s with major U.S.
[02:51:44.292 --> 02:51:46.034]  technical and equipment assistance.
[02:51:46.630 --> 02:51:46.830]  Hmm.
[02:51:47.411 --> 02:51:56.782]  The Stalingrad tractor plant was completely built in the United States, shipped to Stalingrad, and then installed in prefabricated steel buildings also purchased in the United States.
[02:51:57.382 --> 02:51:59.405]  So sure, let's have a Cold War with Russia.
[02:52:00.350 --> 02:52:01.691]  Then elite U.S.
[02:52:01.731 --> 02:52:09.858]  corporations and financiers can supply Russia with the updated weapons under the table and create an even bigger enemy and bigger race wars and everything else.
[02:52:10.278 --> 02:52:12.920]  And when I say race wars, I meant the space war.
[02:52:13.421 --> 02:52:22.408]  It was the space war with Russia that got everybody enticed and very, very eager to do something that was, well, virtually impossible.
[02:52:23.269 --> 02:52:26.051]  Still is, apparently, because we don't go back.
[02:52:26.771 --> 02:52:26.972]  Ever.
[02:52:28.493 --> 02:52:28.833]  Alrighty.
[02:52:29.554 --> 02:52:29.854]  Anyway.
[02:52:31.241 --> 02:52:40.067]  I just want to thank COVID because the good news, people, is that COVID stopped any war action.
[02:52:40.848 --> 02:52:47.452]  For two solid years, no war, virtually no war, and no school shootings.
[02:52:49.113 --> 02:52:53.136]  Not a lot was going on because everybody was respectful of COVID.
[02:52:53.737 --> 02:52:59.419]  You know, you would think that if a nation was really an enemy of another nation, that would be the time you would strike, right?
[02:52:59.479 --> 02:53:02.020]  Wouldn't you think they were at the weakest point at that point?
[02:53:02.840 --> 02:53:03.020]  Nope.
[02:53:03.281 --> 02:53:08.503]  No, because the same people that planned out COVID were planning everything else.
[02:53:09.003 --> 02:53:18.526]  And so I always think it's really interesting because you get really no intersection with plans very often because, you know, you don't want to bump one for another one.
[02:53:18.566 --> 02:53:22.908]  I mean, when one's going so well, you want to keep it going, of course.
[02:53:24.289 --> 02:53:24.730]  Why not?
[02:53:25.070 --> 02:53:28.435]  You want to get the full money's worth, right, out of COVID.
[02:53:28.956 --> 02:53:35.947]  So nothing else really was going on during COVID when, well, I would think most people would think that's exactly when it should have been.
[02:53:37.229 --> 02:53:37.790]  Well, whatever.
[02:53:38.260 --> 02:53:40.881]  People are figuring out they've been lied to for over a hundred years.
[02:53:40.961 --> 02:53:43.181]  And I think that's really the most important thing.
[02:53:43.641 --> 02:53:52.923]  And on a side note, it's interesting because we get a lot of people now that are following the false flags and actually looking at all the clues and understanding what's going on.
[02:53:53.003 --> 02:54:02.725]  So there's some good news for you is that people, if you look at the comment sections, you'll realize on every article, how many people are not buying their BS, which I absolutely love.
[02:54:03.285 --> 02:54:07.306]  So the elites are suddenly coming down with COVID right now.
[02:54:07.762 --> 02:54:11.943]  And I thought COVID was, you know, the seasonal cold.
[02:54:12.483 --> 02:54:13.584]  Well, I don't know.
[02:54:13.904 --> 02:54:30.609]  So my false flag alerts are going off when you see Obama, you see red at the White House, Hillary, and, you know, some of the others, I would say, all coming down with COVID all of a sudden.
[02:54:30.769 --> 02:54:31.369]  Why is that?
[02:54:31.669 --> 02:54:32.910]  Is King fraud a lot next?
[02:54:33.850 --> 02:54:33.970]  Hmm.
[02:54:34.406 --> 02:54:35.907]  Certainly strange, I'll tell you that much.
[02:54:36.528 --> 02:54:41.211]  And they won't let King fraud a lot out of the movie studio next to the White House very often.
[02:54:41.271 --> 02:54:44.694]  In fact, when was the last time he actually had people visit him in the White House?
[02:54:45.454 --> 02:54:46.475]  I'd say never.
[02:54:47.216 --> 02:55:00.165]  And, you know, we had a lot of visitations with Trump as president, but suddenly no one wants to go, or I would pretty much think that's the answer, or all of a sudden there's just no invitations to be had.
[02:55:00.966 --> 02:55:01.086]  Hmm.
[02:55:01.647 --> 02:55:06.289]  Okay, never meets with anyone, never invites anyone, and now he's off to Europe?
[02:55:07.430 --> 02:55:20.276]  I don't know about you, but I kind of gave a deadline of them blaming either a patriot or their own narrative, like COVID, taking him out by the end of this year so they could replace him with Hormala.
[02:55:20.856 --> 02:55:24.858]  Which, more horrific, less horrific, they're both puppets, let's face it.
[02:55:24.938 --> 02:55:25.939]  So does it even matter?
[02:55:25.959 --> 02:55:27.880]  I mean, does it even matter, really?
[02:55:29.180 --> 02:55:30.921]  Somebody pulls the strings and they talk.
[02:55:33.667 --> 02:55:40.467]   repeats the words passage of time, passage of time, passage of time, things like that,
[02:55:40.467 --> 02:55:42.346]  like word of the day.
[02:55:42.346 --> 02:55:48.346]   So we get these two total losers that basically cooed our nation and implemented themselves
[02:55:48.346 --> 02:55:55.346]   into these two seats, but they are absolutely 100% directed by very, very well laid plans.
[02:55:55.346 --> 02:55:57.147]  Let's not forget.
[02:55:57.147 --> 02:56:01.707]   And you know, I have to say, I have to say in all the years of research that I've done
[02:56:01.707 --> 02:56:07.707]   and in 10 years of intense research, and I'm talking intense research, I started out a
[02:56:07.707 --> 02:56:10.426]  little bit of a neocon 10 years ago.
[02:56:10.426 --> 02:56:14.066]   And I just kind of figured, well, whatever we did was always the right thing as most
[02:56:14.066 --> 02:56:15.627]  Americans do, right?
[02:56:15.627 --> 02:56:16.746]  We don't question a lot.
[02:56:17.549 --> 02:56:30.182]  And it wasn't until I took the deep dives down into the real information and all the evidence supporting it by their own documentation and their own words that I finally realized what was going on in this country.
[02:56:30.722 --> 02:56:31.183]  And you know what?
[02:56:31.223 --> 02:56:38.290]  I know something kind of fascinating is everybody that seems to do that is usually led to the same answers.
[02:56:39.111 --> 02:56:39.251]  Hmm.
[02:56:40.140 --> 02:56:49.206]  Not different amounts of information, I'm talking the same information, the same players, the same people, and the same plans, well-laid plans.
[02:56:49.626 --> 02:56:52.988]  The next time somebody calls you a conspiracy theorist...
[02:56:53.641 --> 02:56:54.982]  I mean, I don't know what to do.
[02:56:55.122 --> 02:56:57.643]  Laugh, cry at the stupidity of that remark.
[02:56:58.023 --> 02:57:03.326]  But yes, well-laid plans have always been here, they'll always be here, and they're not going away.
[02:57:03.346 --> 02:57:09.050]  And the only thing that we can do, and the only thing they're afraid of, is the populace figuring it out and exposing it.
[02:57:09.250 --> 02:57:11.251]  It's really the only thing that can stop it.
[02:57:11.831 --> 02:57:22.900]   And so if we can do that as a populace, if we can work really hard to get people to see the actual evidence, That's, hey, that's the only way that we can actually make a dent in what's about to happen.
[02:57:23.081 --> 02:57:23.841]  And I hope we do.
[02:57:24.221 --> 02:57:26.682]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from the Kate Daly Show.
[02:57:26.722 --> 02:57:30.864]  I do a live show every day and thankful to be on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:57:31.205 --> 02:57:34.686]  And of course, you know, everyone called Alex a conspiracy theorist for years.
[02:57:34.986 --> 02:57:35.287]  Really?
[02:57:35.887 --> 02:57:36.727]  Seems to be right.
[02:57:37.668 --> 02:57:38.348]  All these plans.
[02:57:39.769 --> 02:57:40.809]  They're coming true, aren't they?
[02:57:41.369 --> 02:57:50.249]  Thanks you guys.
[02:57:50.291 --> 02:57:56.653]  I got sued more than 50 times by the Democrats after Trump won, and we knocked out and defeated 46 of them.
[02:57:56.753 --> 02:58:03.236]  And we're down to four of the major lawsuits where Democrats sued us in completely rigged jurisdictions and with rigged courts.
[02:58:03.296 --> 02:58:04.657]  Just unbelievable over the top.
[02:58:04.777 --> 02:58:07.138]  In Connecticut, in New Haven, and in Austin, Texas.
[02:58:07.318 --> 02:58:16.442]  Now, I can sit there and keep battling them with the three Austin trials and one Connecticut trial through October.
[02:58:17.603 --> 02:58:18.163]  of this year.
[02:58:18.663 --> 02:58:19.804]  That's four trials.
[02:58:20.004 --> 02:58:26.747]  They're doing four different lawsuits with the Sandy Hook people, two different law firms, all coordinated, to bankrupt us.
[02:58:27.807 --> 02:58:34.090]  And they know now, because the court's ordering all this stuff that's unconstitutional, our finances, they know there's not extra money there.
[02:58:34.350 --> 02:58:35.790]  And they've told us, we don't care.
[02:58:36.090 --> 02:58:38.571]  We want you to be shut down.
[02:58:39.072 --> 02:58:40.672]  Or you can come out against the Second Amendment.
[02:58:40.692 --> 02:58:41.453]  They've actually told us that.
[02:58:42.193 --> 02:58:43.093]  And I'm not going to do that.
[02:58:43.854 --> 02:58:44.554]  It's very simple.
[02:58:45.655 --> 02:58:55.678]  So, I can go through the kangaroo trials with them, and do all that, and then appeal it, and hold them off another year or two, because their goal is to just come padlock and shut this place down.
[02:58:56.478 --> 02:59:00.680]  Or, we can just boycott their trials, and then they get their $500 million judgments.
[02:59:00.880 --> 02:59:01.660]  That's what they asked for.
[02:59:01.860 --> 02:59:06.681]  They asked the insurance company that Genesis has.
[02:59:06.721 --> 02:59:08.662]  I don't have liability insurance for speech.
[02:59:09.142 --> 02:59:10.703]  They said, we want $590 million.
[02:59:10.783 --> 02:59:11.663]  Excuse me, it's $590 million.
[02:59:11.683 --> 02:59:12.583]  Ted doesn't have $2 million.
[02:59:15.484 --> 02:59:26.549]  Okay, that's how out of control these people are because when you're in a rigged game and know it's all rigged and known that, you know, it's all set up from the beginning with judicial tyranny, you can do stuff like that.
[02:59:26.729 --> 02:59:27.890]  They're not going to shut me up.
[02:59:28.030 --> 02:59:29.090]  I'm not going to be shut down.
[02:59:29.430 --> 02:59:35.093]  They can try to, you know, hurt this operation in this facility, but oh, let me tell you, they're not, they're not going to silence anything.
[02:59:35.793 --> 02:59:43.859]   The point is, is that this crew and this infrastructure and all the reporters And all the things that we do here that's so important needs to continue on.
[02:59:43.879 --> 02:59:45.419]  So I've decided to go ahead and battle it.
[02:59:45.739 --> 02:59:47.140]  And I've decided to go ahead and fight them.
[02:59:47.620 --> 02:59:50.061]  I've decided to let them have their show trials and all the rest of it.
[02:59:50.101 --> 02:59:58.905]  And, you know, a judge that says we can't put on evidence because we're already guilty in a default, but we're going to have a jury trial about how guilty I am.
[02:59:59.405 --> 03:00:01.406]  So you're guilty, they just decide how guilty.
[03:00:02.166 --> 03:00:02.927]  Unbelievable.
[03:00:03.187 --> 03:00:03.827]  That's all fine.
[03:00:03.867 --> 03:00:04.588]  We'll let them do it.
[03:00:04.968 --> 03:00:07.070]  Every weapon formed against us will not prosper.
[03:00:07.350 --> 03:00:09.691]  Whatever the devil means for evil, God turns to good.
[03:00:10.032 --> 03:00:15.515]  I've seen this so many times, but we need the funds to go through these four trials.
[03:00:15.996 --> 03:00:19.018]  They want six to eight weeks in Connecticut for their extravaganza.
[03:00:19.538 --> 03:00:28.781]   In Austin, they have BBC and HBO and the lawyers primping and the judge primping and coming in all excited.
[03:00:28.901 --> 03:00:29.821]  It's disgusting.
[03:00:30.041 --> 03:00:31.482]  They claim I live off Sandy Hook.
[03:00:31.683 --> 03:00:33.304]  They claim I made money off Sandy Hook.
[03:00:33.644 --> 03:00:35.445]  You know, this Elizabeth Williams writes a book about it.
[03:00:35.465 --> 03:00:36.186]  It's all over the news.
[03:00:36.506 --> 03:00:38.687]  Selling her book saying I made money off Sandy Hook.
[03:00:38.948 --> 03:00:39.908]  Never made money off that.
[03:00:39.928 --> 03:00:40.869]  Barely ever talked about it.
[03:00:41.149 --> 03:00:44.331]  These are a disgusting lot of leeches.
[03:00:44.792 --> 03:00:46.353]  Okay, these media people, these lawyers.
[03:00:46.553 --> 03:00:47.214]  But that's fine.
[03:00:47.454 --> 03:00:48.876]  Everybody sees them for what they are.
[03:00:49.236 --> 03:00:50.398]  Everybody gets what's happening.
[03:00:50.678 --> 03:00:53.201]  It's all turning to crap in their hands.
[03:00:53.742 --> 03:00:55.544]  But I need funds to fight this war.
[03:00:56.065 --> 03:00:56.946]  This information war.
[03:00:57.026 --> 03:00:59.088]  So, it's very simple.
[03:00:59.429 --> 03:01:01.191]  All of our work's coming to a head right now.
[03:01:01.291 --> 03:01:05.156]  Every day we're having major breakthroughs and just doing incredible things.
[03:01:05.196 --> 03:01:05.856]  Thanks for your support.
[03:01:06.616 --> 03:01:08.196]  But I need more capital now than ever.
[03:01:08.236 --> 03:01:10.737]  We had to build our own infrastructure, our own bandwidth, our own everything.
[03:01:11.217 --> 03:01:12.658]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:01:12.858 --> 03:01:19.660]  Go there and that will, by buying the products, pay for the 5, 6, 7, 8 million views a day we get at Mandaw Video.
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:24.621]  And that'll pay for the broadcast here and the infrastructure and all of this that's hurting the New World Order.
[03:01:24.781 --> 03:01:25.981]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:01:26.002 --> 03:01:27.822]  We have up to 75% off right now.
[03:01:28.222 --> 03:01:31.243]  Massive clearance sale to fund this legal defense of this battle.
[03:01:31.423 --> 03:01:32.483]  And we're never going to give up.
[03:01:32.703 --> 03:01:33.624]  We're never going to get it in.
[03:01:33.664 --> 03:01:34.604]  But we could give out.
[03:01:35.004 --> 03:01:38.606]  So we need your financial support now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:01:38.706 --> 03:01:58.706]  Don't wait and I salute you and thank you all.
[03:01:58.718 --> 03:02:00.019]  I've been taking it for 20 years.
[03:02:00.139 --> 03:02:04.041]  I learned with children, especially, when they were, you know, tired and grumpy but not going to sleep.
[03:02:04.161 --> 03:02:09.106]  Give them a little bit of that, you know, mood stuff or whatever you want to call it, and they would sleep a lot better.
[03:02:09.166 --> 03:02:11.229]  And it's good for their heart, their whole electrochemical system.
[03:02:11.329 --> 03:02:16.174]  So our developers came up with one that has both types of the good magnesium and tastes even better.
[03:02:16.294 --> 03:02:17.315]  And I'm just blown away by it.
[03:02:17.335 --> 03:02:18.516]  It's been sold out for eight months.
[03:02:18.537 --> 03:02:19.798]  I'm so glad it's back in.
[03:02:19.898 --> 03:02:21.860]  Fizzy Magnesium, 25% off.
[03:02:22.341 --> 03:02:23.282]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:02:23.302 --> 03:02:24.423]  You need to experience it.
[03:02:24.903 --> 03:02:25.844]  And then a new item.
[03:02:26.565 --> 03:02:28.367]  I've been wanting it for two years, finally got it.
[03:02:28.447 --> 03:02:30.569]  It's Immune Support from InfoWars Life.
[03:02:30.709 --> 03:02:35.053]  Elderberry, Echinacea, Astrologus Root, Angelica Root, and Lomatum Root.
[03:02:35.213 --> 03:02:37.295]  All of these are concentrated, cold-pressed.
[03:02:37.335 --> 03:02:38.916]  One of the top developers in the country.
[03:02:39.157 --> 03:02:40.898]  So good for adults, children, everybody.
[03:02:40.958 --> 03:02:45.382]  This is something you should be taking every day, 12 months out of the year, and it funds the InfoWars.
[03:02:45.462 --> 03:02:46.744]  Immune Support, now available.
[03:02:46.844 --> 03:02:47.865]  InfoWarsTore.com.
