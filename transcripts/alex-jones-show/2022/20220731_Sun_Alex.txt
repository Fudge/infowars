[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.740]  [Outro]
[00:00:15.798 --> 00:00:16.678]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:16.798 --> 00:00:23.118]  today. Hey Alexa.
[00:00:23.118 --> 00:00:33.118]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:24.821 --> 00:00:26.862]  Where did Joe Biden fall off his cycle?
[00:00:27.082 --> 00:00:30.144]  Joe Biden died in National Naval Medical Center.
[00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:35.266]  I could spend the next hour on an 11-minute speech Biden put out.
[00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:37.232]  Let me close with this.
[00:00:37.292 --> 00:00:39.313]  Every day we rely on law enforcement to save lives.
[00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:42.636]  Then on January 6th, we relied on law enforcement to save our democracy.
[00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:44.137]  We saw what happened.
[00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:49.615]   minutes he bleaks six times. Let me close with this. Every day we rely on law
[00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:54.296]   enforcement to save lives. Then on January 6th we relied on law
[00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:58.655]  enforcement to save our democracy. We saw what happened.
[00:00:58.655 --> 00:01:07.899]   The Capitol Police, the DC Metropolitan Police, other law enforcement agencies, were attacked and assaulted before our very eyes.
[00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:12.201]  Speared, sprayed, stomped on, brutalized.
[00:01:13.322 --> 00:01:14.262]  Lives were lost.
[00:01:15.403 --> 00:01:24.988]  And for three hours, the defeated former President of the United States watched it all happen as he sat in the comfort of the private dining room next to the Oval Office.
[00:01:26.087 --> 00:01:31.487]   While he was doing that, brave law enforcement officers were subject to the medieval hell
[00:01:31.487 --> 00:01:36.807]  for three hours, dripping in blood, surrounded by carnage.
[00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:41.567]   Face to face with crazed mob that believed the lies of the defeated president.
[00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:44.087]  The police were heroes that day.
[00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:47.606]  Donald Trump lacked the courage to act.
[00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:53.887]   The brave women and men in blue all across this nation should never forget that.
[00:01:53.887 --> 00:01:56.286]  You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-cop.
[00:01:56.677 --> 00:01:59.020]  You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy.
[00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.863]  You can't be pro-insurrection and pro-American.
[00:02:02.444 --> 00:02:07.930]  I mean, he looks like an animatronic robot at Chuck E. Cheese or something.
[00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:12.891]   I mean, ladies and gentlemen, this looks like the intro to a horror movie or something where
[00:02:12.891 --> 00:02:14.891]  body snatchers have taken over.
[00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:16.891]  [crowd cheering]
[00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:18.891]  [crowd cheering]
[00:02:18.891 --> 00:02:20.891]  [crowd cheering]
[00:02:20.891 --> 00:02:22.891]  [crowd cheering]
[00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:24.890]  [crowd cheering]
[00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.891]  This happens in human civilization.
[00:02:26.771 --> 00:02:28.871]  It normally collapses civilization for at least a time.
[00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:31.472]  When the good people let crazies get in charge.
[00:02:31.932 --> 00:02:38.755]  Why is the Biden administration building a border wall in Arizona?
[00:02:38.775 --> 00:02:41.756]  So, we are not finishing the wall.
[00:02:42.276 --> 00:02:47.618]  We are cleaning up the mess the prior administration left behind in their failed attempt.
[00:02:48.398 --> 00:02:49.379]  Uh, to build a wall?
[00:02:49.399 --> 00:02:56.605]  Of course, the more pain we are all experiencing from the high price of gas, the more benefit there is for those who can access electric vehicles.
[00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:57.866]  We let them be in control.
[00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:01.709]  Mr. Biden, are you still groping Senators' children?
[00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.010]  Creepy Joe Biden?
[00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.094]  They always start assaulting reality and assaulting common sense and assaulting due process and assaulting logic.
[00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:11.157]  And people keep acquiescing until everything disintegrates.
[00:03:11.597 --> 00:03:26.967]   This is the first time in American history, I believe, That a chamber of the Congress will pass a bill openly defying the Supreme Court's explicit declaration of the constitutional rights of the American people.
[00:03:28.107 --> 00:03:35.652]  It represents the farthest ever reach of the Democrats' long-pursued massive resistance doctrine.
[00:03:37.132 --> 00:03:45.037]  In markup, I asked if any Democrat disputed that this bill bans guns and magazines in common use.
[00:03:46.041 --> 00:03:50.742]  Chairman Nadler candidly responded, quote, Would the gentleman yield?
[00:03:51.142 --> 00:03:53.162]  I would, if I'm for an answer to that question.
[00:03:53.182 --> 00:03:54.323]  Yeah, that's the point of the bill.
[00:03:54.543 --> 00:04:01.744]  So, to clarify, Mr. Chairman, you're saying it is the point of the bill to ban weapons that are in common use in the United States today?
[00:04:01.764 --> 00:04:20.410]   Yes, the problem is... In other words, the essence of the bill is to stop commerce in weapons As alternatively described by the court in Heller in 2008, as those, quote, typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes, close quote.
[00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.491]  And that is now the point we've entered at every level.
[00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:24.992]  Donald Trump lacked the courage to act.
[00:04:25.752 --> 00:04:30.994]  The brave women and men in blue all across this nation should never forget that.
[00:04:31.594 --> 00:04:36.756]  Folks, as we fight inflation, bringing down gas prices is a big part of the job.
[00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:42.998]  All right, I wanted to play some of the 11-minute speech, so you can see he's not blinking, and then another speech later where he is.
[00:04:43.058 --> 00:04:46.059]  I mean, if you can figure out what this is, please tell me.
[00:04:46.338 --> 00:04:52.899]   We've reached out to some physiologists and people that can perhaps tell us what in the
[00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:55.059]  world this means, but it's getting crazy.
[00:04:55.059 --> 00:05:11.057]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:05:11.717 --> 00:05:13.178]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:05:13.418 --> 00:05:14.559]  Well, so does he.
[00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:19.841]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:20.662 --> 00:05:25.604]  Well, the United Nations Global Government, WEF, Combine have been busy.
[00:05:26.145 --> 00:05:33.219]   These A month ago, they announced that the private corporate dictatorship's merging with the UN, that it controls publicly.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:40.483]  Last week, they announced global censorship interfacing with big tech to block basically any type of pro-human information.
[00:05:40.503 --> 00:05:42.864]  Ahead of new COVID lockdowns.
[00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:46.386]  And now the UN officially came out on Friday.
[00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:47.767]  I didn't see it until yesterday.
[00:05:48.661 --> 00:05:55.284]  And released a video about how they're going to run the new global ID system and control the world ID.
[00:05:55.444 --> 00:05:58.785]  So world government with a world ID run by the tyrannical UN.
[00:05:58.805 --> 00:06:00.046]  We've got that information.
[00:06:00.606 --> 00:06:06.849]  We've got the admission of the global cutoff of food supplies as part two of the Great Resets.
[00:06:06.889 --> 00:06:09.870]  They already used lockdowns to destroy food supply all over the world.
[00:06:10.931 --> 00:06:12.731]  In some third world countries they did it for two years.
[00:06:13.492 --> 00:06:20.594]   Now, They're moving ahead to ban most types of farming and ranching in every major nation of the earth.
[00:06:21.094 --> 00:06:23.176]  Unbelievable what that's going to cause.
[00:06:23.196 --> 00:06:31.021]  This is going to accelerate a total collapse of the third world and a flooding of the first world and our collapse as well in Italy.
[00:06:32.182 --> 00:06:37.884]  Australia, in the Netherlands, in the UK, and in Canada, millions of farmers are protesting.
[00:06:38.564 --> 00:06:42.325]  Almost zero coverage in the corporate media of this.
[00:06:42.385 --> 00:06:43.186]  Why are they protesting?
[00:06:43.206 --> 00:06:45.606]  They said this is a UN edict of the WEF.
[00:06:46.527 --> 00:06:52.428]  Your cows, your farms, the grain you're growing, all carbon is toxic.
[00:06:52.488 --> 00:06:54.529]  Well, we're carbon-based life forms.
[00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.830]  That's coming up.
[00:06:58.226 --> 00:07:01.916]  Biden's had COVID, supposedly, or touched it positive twice in the last two weeks.
[00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:02.618]  He's in...
[00:07:04.045 --> 00:07:18.332]  Hiding again, supposedly quarantining himself, and massive new information adding on to all the other insurance numbers and government numbers we've had around the Western world of the so-called COVID vaccines causing mass death, blood clots, infertility, and cancer.
[00:07:18.893 --> 00:07:30.339]  Those are three stacks I've got here that are absolutely massive and a lot of new monkeypox news as they prepare the new global lockdown that's already been announced, but they are planning to do it later this fall.
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.561]  That's their current trajectory.
[00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:33.701]  This is all pre-planned.
[00:07:33.741 --> 00:07:34.542]  It's all being rolled out.
[00:07:34.582 --> 00:07:35.302]  It's all coming up.
[00:07:35.803 --> 00:07:36.543]  And so much more today.
[00:07:36.563 --> 00:07:38.784]  We have a special guest joining us in the second hour.
[00:07:38.824 --> 00:07:40.525]  But let me just get this out of the way right now.
[00:07:42.547 --> 00:07:45.308]  I am proud of the work of InfoWars in the last 28 years.
[00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:48.290]  We have never made a mistake on purpose.
[00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.611]  We've never lied on purpose.
[00:07:50.191 --> 00:07:50.852]  We've never lied.
[00:07:51.932 --> 00:07:59.717]  But we're not like the corporate mercenary New World Order parrots that put out their lies and propaganda, who never admit when they're wrong.
[00:08:00.615 --> 00:08:03.016]  When we make a mistake, we admit to it.
[00:08:03.996 --> 00:08:08.738]  And it's essential that we do that because all we have is our credibility.
[00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:21.143]  That said, with these three Sandy Hook trials, which are show trials where the judges have found me guilty in both Texas and Connecticut without ever letting me have a jury trial, the juries are told he is guilty.
[00:08:21.864 --> 00:08:24.465]  The judges said I can't say I'm innocent, well I'm obviously going to.
[00:08:25.598 --> 00:08:28.099]  And even sway on, you know, up on murder charges.
[00:08:28.139 --> 00:08:30.000]  Charlie Manson can say he was innocent if he wanted to.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.261]  In my case, I am innocent of what they've claimed.
[00:08:32.601 --> 00:08:39.464]  Premeditatedly lying about nobody dying at Sandy Hook to make money and saying my main career was Sandy Hook.
[00:08:39.904 --> 00:08:48.548]  When they've talked more about Sandy Hook at this week-long trial, the first week of it, than we talked about in all my time on air since it happened a decade ago.
[00:08:49.068 --> 00:08:50.449]  We have all those numbers down to the minute.
[00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:54.291]  So it's just a complete lie and a fraud.
[00:08:55.011 --> 00:09:00.314]  That said, I looked at some of the evidence later that they claim show that it didn't happen and it wasn't true.
[00:09:00.474 --> 00:09:01.695]  I believe mass shootings happened.
[00:09:02.255 --> 00:09:03.496]  I believe Parkland happened.
[00:09:03.556 --> 00:09:04.676]  I believe Columbine happened.
[00:09:05.197 --> 00:09:13.561]  And I believe in every case we know it's linked to Prozac-type drugs, video games shoot them up, and mental illness, and police stand-downs like we just saw in Uvalde.
[00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:14.582]  Very, very shameful.
[00:09:15.458 --> 00:09:21.386]  That said though, I didn't lie about WMDs in Iraq on purpose like the CNN and the New York Times.
[00:09:21.707 --> 00:09:23.729]  I didn't lie about it being safe and effective.
[00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:27.034]  These poison shots they now admit don't work and actually make you sick.
[00:09:27.655 --> 00:09:30.679]  I didn't promote drag queen pedophile time and I was the first!
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:45.704]  More than 14 years ago to expose Jeffrey Epstein and Epstein Island and how they were flying kids out and using it to blackmail and control people particularly in the science divisions of the world for Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to take over and that Epstein basically worked for them.
[00:09:46.344 --> 00:09:47.924]  We are the first to expose it.
[00:09:48.344 --> 00:09:53.606]  We have been vindicated and I am proud of the body of our work and they see InfoWars.
[00:09:54.366 --> 00:10:02.008]  As the brightest light in this coming darkness of populism and pro-human, pro-God, pro-family, pro-children.
[00:10:02.669 --> 00:10:05.169]  And that's why they hate us, because they hate you.
[00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:09.691]  And they believe they can take us off air, they will be able to defeat everybody else.
[00:10:10.211 --> 00:10:18.454]  And they have admitted that the model of censoring us and debanking us and suing us is the model to shut down Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, and everybody else.
[00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:26.826]  That said, when I declared bankruptcy four months ago with Infowars and three other sub-companies, that was a very real bankruptcy.
[00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:36.753]  And it was an attempt to bring a brokered settlement deal with them in federal court, because you go to president-of-the-line federal court, and say, I don't have $10 million, I don't have $5 million.
[00:10:37.194 --> 00:10:41.057]  The time we had $3 million, we could scrounge together out of the company, maybe.
[00:10:41.943 --> 00:10:45.066]  We put $3 million on the table and said, here it is in a federal filing.
[00:10:45.687 --> 00:10:47.088]  We're in limited bankruptcy.
[00:10:47.108 --> 00:10:48.529]  You can come check it all for yourselves.
[00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:49.991]  And they said, you're a fraud.
[00:10:50.031 --> 00:10:50.732]  You're a liar.
[00:10:51.552 --> 00:10:52.453]  All this other garbage.
[00:10:52.593 --> 00:10:55.957]  Now, four months later, we don't have any extra money.
[00:10:57.118 --> 00:10:59.160]  And we're going into full bankruptcy.
[00:11:01.089 --> 00:11:15.476]  To absolutely show all of this, let them have their first trial, show them all the numbers, and then they want to have two trials, one in Texas and one in Connecticut, starting in September, and the judges have said, screw you, you've got to be in both places at once.
[00:11:16.937 --> 00:11:18.117]  Which is impossible.
[00:11:19.138 --> 00:11:35.332]   And so we're putting it before the federal judge, we declared bankruptcy on Free Speech Systems, the parent company of this whole operation, all the cards on the table, and I'm putting my finances in, everything, so this crap stops.
[00:11:36.013 --> 00:11:46.045]  When they got these bankruptcy lawyers, very respected ones in here, six months ago as we began to develop this, they said, my God, you've not paid yourself in over a year?
[00:11:47.711 --> 00:11:50.192]  And they went, my God, the news claims you've got all this money.
[00:11:50.212 --> 00:11:50.632]  You don't.
[00:11:51.012 --> 00:11:52.052]  They're just making it up.
[00:11:52.152 --> 00:11:56.014]  And so they've never seen anything like this.
[00:11:56.474 --> 00:12:02.276]  There are articles all over the news saying, I made $76 million in 2019.
[00:12:03.976 --> 00:12:05.797]  We almost lost money in 2019.
[00:12:07.217 --> 00:12:14.339]  The big year we made money, and thank God because it lasted us for years, because I saved a bunch of it and invested it in real estate and doubled the money.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:24.286]   We have been operating In the last two years off of money that people buying products and support in that gigantic year of 2016.
[00:12:24.747 --> 00:12:29.131]  And I said, I'm going to take this money and invest it in real estate and other things.
[00:12:29.351 --> 00:12:33.755]  We sold that real estate last year and it has funded this place and kept us on air.
[00:12:33.855 --> 00:12:40.301]  So I was a good steward like the ant who saves for the winter to the grasshopper that doesn't save during the summer and dies in the winter.
[00:12:41.162 --> 00:12:43.164]  But this ant is out of money.
[00:12:44.497 --> 00:12:48.483]  This has been a long, hard winter of tyranny, and I'm no sunshine patriot.
[00:12:48.503 --> 00:12:50.606]  I'm a winter soldier, so I'm not a victim.
[00:12:51.007 --> 00:12:53.009]  I'm a target because I've been effective telling the truth.
[00:12:54.363 --> 00:12:56.023]  But listen, we're not going to get shut down.
[00:12:56.244 --> 00:13:05.546]  They have admitted, the Democrats that run this, in the Austin American Statesman today and in the Boston Globe and the New York Times, their goal is to quote, punish me and silence us and shut us down.
[00:13:06.046 --> 00:13:10.568]  That's why they lie to the jury in the damages portion and say, I got hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:13:11.068 --> 00:13:18.270]  That's why they do this so they'll come up with some giant judgment on the already guilty Alex Jones that they hope is too big for us to even get a bond on.
[00:13:19.451 --> 00:13:25.295]  Well, once you're in bankruptcy, it's all there in the court, and the bonds for the appeals are half your net worth.
[00:13:25.736 --> 00:13:27.917]  Well, that isn't going to be very, very much.
[00:13:28.298 --> 00:13:34.642]  Maybe a million, million and a half dollars or something, and they're going to try to claim all this other wealth, but it's not true.
[00:13:34.683 --> 00:13:38.585]  So then we will be able to continue on with appeals and the rest of it for years?
[00:13:39.466 --> 00:13:44.289]  And we will be able to fight these kangaroo courts and what they've done.
[00:13:44.309 --> 00:13:45.689]  And this Texas judge really screwed up.
[00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:50.812]  She put a Motions and Limiting in two months ago saying, cannot mention the First Amendment, says it.
[00:13:51.112 --> 00:13:52.053]  I published it on Infowars.
[00:13:52.293 --> 00:13:52.713]  Her order.
[00:13:53.194 --> 00:13:58.056]  Cannot mention First Amendment, cannot say you're innocent, and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:08.102]  So, she then withdrew that when we took it to the Court of Appeals voluntarily, but she's still trying to enforce those rules on the trial.
[00:14:09.591 --> 00:14:12.512]  And so if the Texas Supreme Court wants to certify that, fine.
[00:14:12.592 --> 00:14:13.313]  Texas is dead.
[00:14:13.793 --> 00:14:14.673]  I left it all on the field.
[00:14:15.033 --> 00:14:21.356]  I'll still be able to work for some other company and be on air, because I don't give a damn about money at the end of the day, except as a tool to fight the globalists.
[00:14:21.616 --> 00:14:23.597]  And so one way or another, InfoWars will stay on the air.
[00:14:23.917 --> 00:14:25.117]  Will it be crippling for a while?
[00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:26.498]  Will we have to get rid of a bunch of the crew?
[00:14:26.538 --> 00:14:26.818]  Yes.
[00:14:27.298 --> 00:14:28.199]  But that's down the road.
[00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:31.320]  That's why your massive support now is beyond critical.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:34.201]  It's essential at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:14:53.210 --> 00:15:06.510]   Alright, I want to talk about the dying corporate media's arrogance
[00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:10.110]   and how they try to set themselves up as fact checkers and the arbiters of truth.
[00:15:10.113 --> 00:15:11.253]  It's truly sick.
[00:15:11.833 --> 00:15:13.334]  They've had hundreds that I've seen.
[00:15:14.134 --> 00:15:19.395]  There's thousands of their pundits on CNN, ABC News, NBC, all of them.
[00:15:19.915 --> 00:15:29.237]  I've got dozens of clips just I saw this weekend saying a recession is not two quarters of negative growth.
[00:15:29.056 --> 00:15:40.256]   I mean that's the very definition of their Keynesian economic system.
[00:15:40.256 --> 00:15:45.095]   And you've got Paul Krugman out there saying, well he admitted he was wrong last week that
[00:15:45.095 --> 00:15:46.296]  we weren't going to go into a recession.
[00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:49.450]  But then he says, but don't worry, the recession means something different today.
[00:15:50.291 --> 00:15:52.811]  They say that a man is a woman and a woman is a man.
[00:15:53.931 --> 00:15:55.052]  They promote pedophilia.
[00:15:56.132 --> 00:15:57.992]  Everything they do is a lie on purpose.
[00:16:00.573 --> 00:16:04.334]  And they point their fingers at the American people that don't believe a word they say.
[00:16:04.894 --> 00:16:09.990]   And if we question Jesse Smollett or Yuvaldi, Or Bubba Wallace?
[00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:11.571]  Or Gulf of Tonkin?
[00:16:11.631 --> 00:16:12.391]  Or 9-11?
[00:16:12.451 --> 00:16:13.052]  We're bad.
[00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:15.273]  No, we're good for questioning.
[00:16:16.134 --> 00:16:16.854]  And we should.
[00:16:17.115 --> 00:16:19.276]  And we'll continue on questioning.
[00:16:20.817 --> 00:16:32.653]   But I saw a video clip of the BBC attacking the Azerbaijani president He's obviously very well spoken and very well educated.
[00:16:33.734 --> 00:16:36.395]  And he says, we have free open media here in this country.
[00:16:37.035 --> 00:16:43.918]  You're the ones in the UK and the US that have tortured and almost killed Julian Assange in solitary confinement for eight plus years.
[00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:53.343]  You're the fraud and this is the perfect way to counter these people that set themselves up as our bosses when they have the worst records on purpose.
[00:16:55.926 --> 00:17:04.486]   of lying by design. How many Project Veritas videos have we seen of CNN and MSNBC and ABC
[00:17:04.486 --> 00:17:07.896]  and all of them behind the scenes in their own outtakes?
[00:17:07.896 --> 00:17:12.046]   Remember ABC News? Oh, we knew Epstein was raping people five years ago. They're running child kidnap
[00:17:12.046 --> 00:17:16.485]   rings of blackmail people, but we were told don't cover it. I wish I could have.
[00:17:16.684 --> 00:17:20.207]  I'd really been big, the teleprompter Bimbo said.
[00:17:20.508 --> 00:17:23.070]  She didn't care about the kidnapped kids or the sex trade.
[00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:26.052]  She was just mad she couldn't break it because that'd be a big story for her.
[00:17:27.433 --> 00:17:28.434]  That was Project Veritas.
[00:17:28.454 --> 00:17:32.578]  Just Project Veritas has got to release like, what, a hundred in the last six, seven years?
[00:17:33.478 --> 00:17:37.482]  Undercover videos of executives and producers admitting they lie on purpose?
[00:17:38.303 --> 00:17:40.124]  There's no executives here telling me what to say.
[00:17:40.404 --> 00:17:42.206]  I give you what I think is really going on.
[00:17:43.831 --> 00:18:00.067]  But again, they set themselves up as self-appointed masters who then organize the corporate media and all the rest of them together at the very same time to then demonize the populace, demonize the person standing up and exposing the New World Order.
[00:18:00.087 --> 00:18:08.335]  So I'm quite honored to be attacked by this system, but it's still scary up close to see that their corruption goes all the way down to the local court systems.
[00:18:09.383 --> 00:18:15.549]  And that the entire corporate media is in lockstep, refusing to report, that judge found me guilty without a jury.
[00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:20.915]  And that we gave them all the damn discovery that no one would ever give anybody.
[00:18:21.175 --> 00:18:23.438]  Bank accounts, all our emails, everything.
[00:18:23.458 --> 00:18:25.820]  And they would say, oh, you didn't give it to us all.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.081]  Oh, there's more.
[00:18:27.522 --> 00:18:28.283]  For four years.
[00:18:30.077 --> 00:18:32.800]  And then I'm sitting there in the trial on how I'm guilty.
[00:18:33.221 --> 00:18:34.522]  Guilty until proven guiltier.
[00:18:34.983 --> 00:18:37.826]  And they're showing all the emails, all the text messages, all the stuff.
[00:18:38.107 --> 00:18:42.732]  And we gave it all to him, and then the judge is telling him he's defaulted because he didn't give us any information.
[00:18:42.952 --> 00:18:44.114]  He didn't show up to court.
[00:18:45.395 --> 00:18:45.996]  All a lie.
[00:18:46.316 --> 00:18:49.240]  Oh, we missed like one or two deadlines during COVID.
[00:18:50.609 --> 00:18:55.512]  But in that, you might get sanctioned for the cost of the court hearing, maybe $5,000, $10,000.
[00:18:56.053 --> 00:19:00.476]  No, she sanctioned me over a million and a half dollars the last year and a half, alone.
[00:19:01.136 --> 00:19:03.358]  Connecticut sanctioned us hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:19:03.538 --> 00:19:04.639]  The exact same blueprint.
[00:19:04.839 --> 00:19:05.560]  They're being run.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.760]  They're being told what to do.
[00:19:09.663 --> 00:19:13.926]  Oh, the judge also doesn't want it mentioned that we gave them discovery while they show it to the jury.
[00:19:14.226 --> 00:19:15.667]  She's hoping she can keep them in the dark.
[00:19:17.483 --> 00:19:23.073]  But look at how the President of Azerbaijan counters the arrogant BBC.
[00:19:23.113 --> 00:19:23.935]  This is pure gold.
[00:19:27.491 --> 00:19:31.753]  Internet users in Azerbaijan is more than 80%.
[00:19:32.293 --> 00:19:40.976]  Can you imagine the restriction of media in a country where internet is free, there is no censorship, and there are 80% of internet users?
[00:19:41.436 --> 00:19:43.137]  We have millions of people on Facebook.
[00:19:43.197 --> 00:19:45.058]  How can you say that we don't have free media?
[00:19:45.558 --> 00:19:48.199]  This is, again, a biased approach.
[00:19:48.659 --> 00:19:53.841]  This is an attempt to create a perception in Western audience about Azerbaijan.
[00:19:54.181 --> 00:20:02.287]  We have opposition, we have NGOs, we have free political activity, we have free media, we have freedom of speech.
[00:20:03.008 --> 00:20:05.890]  But if you raise this question, can I ask you also one?
[00:20:06.771 --> 00:20:11.215]  How do you assess what happened to Mr. Assange?
[00:20:11.835 --> 00:20:14.117]  Is it a reflection of free media in your country?
[00:20:15.134 --> 00:20:17.295]  We're not here to discuss my country.
[00:20:17.575 --> 00:20:18.236]  No, let's discuss.
[00:20:18.256 --> 00:20:18.956]  Let's discuss.
[00:20:19.036 --> 00:20:26.200]  In order to accuse me, saying that Armenians will not have free media here, let's talk about Assange.
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:30.482]  How many years, sorry, how many years he spent in Ecuadorian embassy?
[00:20:30.782 --> 00:20:31.383]  And for what?
[00:20:31.823 --> 00:20:32.583]  And where is he now?
[00:20:33.224 --> 00:20:34.644]  For journalistic activity.
[00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:36.846]  You kept that person hostage.
[00:20:37.606 --> 00:20:40.709]  Actually killing him, morally and physically.
[00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:43.912]  You did it, not us, and now he's in prison.
[00:20:44.232 --> 00:20:47.996]  So you have no moral right to talk about free media when you do these things.
[00:20:48.959 --> 00:20:53.942]  Returning to the conflict, how long... Yeah, better return to the conflict, because this is not what you like.
[00:20:54.443 --> 00:20:57.404]  You like only to accuse, only to attack.
[00:20:57.725 --> 00:21:08.351]  But look at the mirror, look, I tell many times, before coming and lecturing us, and in your question, accusing me, it's not a question, it's accusation.
[00:21:08.732 --> 00:21:10.052]  You talk like a prosecutor.
[00:21:10.533 --> 00:21:10.773]  Why?
[00:21:11.113 --> 00:21:15.256]  If you're so democratic and so objective, why you keep Assange in prison?
[00:21:15.856 --> 00:21:16.276]  For what?
[00:21:16.857 --> 00:21:20.880]  You keep him in prison because of his journalistic activity.
[00:21:22.582 --> 00:21:25.644]  I'm not keeping him in prison, President Aliyev.
[00:21:25.684 --> 00:21:27.305]  You don't like this?
[00:21:27.406 --> 00:21:28.466]  It's not a question of don't like.
[00:21:28.486 --> 00:21:29.547]  You are not used to this.
[00:21:29.627 --> 00:21:30.988]  It's not the subject of our interview.
[00:21:31.008 --> 00:21:32.089]  You are used only to attack.
[00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.051]  It's not the subject of our interview.
[00:21:34.091 --> 00:21:34.932]  In which respect, President Aliyev?
[00:21:34.952 --> 00:21:37.053]  No, it is not the subject of interview, but you raised it.
[00:21:37.654 --> 00:21:38.234]  You raised it?
[00:21:38.455 --> 00:21:39.115]  No, you raised it.
[00:21:39.175 --> 00:21:40.436]  You raised the case of Alex Jones.
[00:21:40.456 --> 00:21:46.526]   You said, Armenians, if you don't have a free media in your country, Listen to that gaslighting witch.
[00:21:46.606 --> 00:21:48.567]  I'm surprised she didn't fly into the interview on a broom.
[00:21:49.288 --> 00:21:56.853]  She says, you raised the issue of media censorship, and he goes, no I didn't, you did.
[00:21:57.233 --> 00:21:58.434]  She goes, I mean Assange.
[00:21:58.954 --> 00:22:10.541]  How can she lecture them, when I've looked at it, they're about as free as the UK is, which isn't that good, and then say that him bringing up Assange doesn't matter.
[00:22:11.922 --> 00:22:16.154]   Now look, I'm a proud Of exposing that there weren't WMDs in Iraq.
[00:22:16.574 --> 00:22:20.075]  And the right wing called me, Fox News called me a communist then.
[00:22:20.215 --> 00:22:23.956]  No, I'm an American patriot that doesn't want to get our troops killed, doesn't want American illegal wars.
[00:22:24.397 --> 00:22:27.358]  And I've exposed the pedophile rings that are now out in the open of Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:22:27.998 --> 00:22:31.879]  And now even Joe Rogan gets on there all the time and says Alex Jones was the first to break it.
[00:22:32.239 --> 00:22:38.301]  And Joe now talks about the multiple intelligence agencies that are clearly involved controlling Epstein.
[00:22:38.321 --> 00:22:40.482]  But he says he doesn't know why they're going after scientists.
[00:22:41.769 --> 00:22:43.090]  The scientists are the real elite.
[00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:54.478]  And if they get all the heads of the major universities and major scientific groups blackmailed, then they can launch a COVID-19, even though it's man-made, and have it covered up because they control the scientific intelligentsia.
[00:22:54.498 --> 00:22:57.660]  We're going to play this quick clip, and then I got so much more.
[00:22:58.221 --> 00:23:02.564]  Man, the food being cut off, the next phase of the collapse, the lockdowns, all of it.
[00:23:03.945 --> 00:23:05.626]  Next segment, and we've got some amazing news.
[00:23:05.946 --> 00:23:07.207]  Wait till you see it out of Australia.
[00:23:07.227 --> 00:23:07.948]  They're really waking up.
[00:23:10.153 --> 00:23:12.315]  It was an intelligence operation.
[00:23:12.875 --> 00:23:21.841]  Whoever was running it, whether it was the Mossad or whether it was the CIA or whether it was a combination of both, it was an intelligence operation.
[00:23:21.941 --> 00:23:24.143]  They were bringing in people and compromising them.
[00:23:24.483 --> 00:23:35.330]  And then when they would compromise them, they would use, you know, whatever they had on them to influence their opinions and the way they expressed those opinions.
[00:23:36.211 --> 00:23:39.411]   And I don't know why they would want to do that with scientists.
[00:23:39.411 --> 00:23:52.769]  Big Brother.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.340]  Mainstream media.
[00:23:54.921 --> 00:23:56.001]  Government cover-ups.
[00:23:56.801 --> 00:23:58.241]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:23:58.501 --> 00:23:59.642]  Well, so does he.
[00:24:00.162 --> 00:24:04.682]  Live, from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24:04.983 --> 00:24:05.943]  One last breath.
[00:24:06.282 --> 00:24:08.282]  Whirlwinds blows.
[00:24:08.282 --> 00:24:14.282]  Lock up your wife and children now.
[00:24:14.282 --> 00:24:16.282]  This is stupid now!
[00:24:15.885 --> 00:24:17.225]  Time to wield the blade.
[00:24:20.595 --> 00:24:22.836]  The horsemen are drawing nearer.
[00:24:26.478 --> 00:24:27.999]  They come to take your life.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:30.980]  Onto the dead of night.
[00:24:33.401 --> 00:24:34.662]  You see the four horsemen ride.
[00:24:35.241 --> 00:24:37.241]  So choose your fate.
[00:24:37.241 --> 00:24:39.241]  Or choose your fate to die!
[00:24:39.241 --> 00:24:43.241]  Oh yeah!
[00:24:43.241 --> 00:24:45.241]  The Four Horsemen.
[00:24:45.241 --> 00:24:46.080]  (upbeat music)
[00:24:46.267 --> 00:24:47.248]  And I saw a white horse.
[00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:49.749]  And he that rode on it was named Death.
[00:24:51.542 --> 00:24:53.523]  The horse of famine has come as well.
[00:24:56.565 --> 00:25:00.848]  Powerful article up on InfoWars.com from the Brownstone Institute.
[00:25:00.928 --> 00:25:02.749]  No farmers, no food, no life.
[00:25:03.469 --> 00:25:04.210]  Another big report.
[00:25:04.290 --> 00:25:05.731]  Top scientists, top...
[00:25:06.716 --> 00:25:14.857]  Experts around the world confirmed that the WEF-UN policies are what is destroying the crop yields and shutting the world economy down.
[00:25:14.897 --> 00:25:24.019]  And the UN admits, with the World Economic Forum, we're cutting off the farms to lower carbon because crops and cows produce carbon that's part of the life cycle.
[00:25:25.419 --> 00:25:36.381]  Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel reveals climate crisis fears influences F1 retirement, saying driving cars and creating carbon is bad, so the top F1 driver is looking to quit.
[00:25:37.785 --> 00:25:43.670]  Drake defends his short private jet flights, though he supports carbon taxes and taking your cars away, by saying plane was empty.
[00:25:45.732 --> 00:25:53.358]  Let's play a powerful Australian Senator, Malcolm Roberts, dropping absolute truth bombs on Klaus Schwab and the Great Reset.
[00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:58.163]  Two different clips as he lays out the human resistance movement worldwide.
[00:25:58.203 --> 00:26:00.464]  You're either for the New World Order, or you're against it.
[00:26:00.565 --> 00:26:04.658]   We are the resistance, and make no mistake, It is this transmission.
[00:26:05.018 --> 00:26:09.922]  Paulson Aro's son, who's also in the Congress, told me this years ago at CPAC.
[00:26:10.262 --> 00:26:16.186]  Paulson Aro said it, but was invited down there to interview the President like Tucker was, not bragging him, just showing our effect, your effect supporting us.
[00:26:17.287 --> 00:26:18.668]  Orban's been influenced by us.
[00:26:19.189 --> 00:26:20.289]  All of them have been influenced.
[00:26:20.890 --> 00:26:24.192]  And we now have Australian leaders really waking up.
[00:26:24.232 --> 00:26:25.433]  So let's play back-to-back.
[00:26:26.394 --> 00:26:28.275]  Australian Senator Malcolm Rhodes.
[00:26:28.676 --> 00:26:30.937]  Let's play clip three and four back-to-back.
[00:26:30.957 --> 00:26:31.338]  Here they are.
[00:26:32.642 --> 00:26:34.123]  The United Nations has a problem.
[00:26:34.663 --> 00:26:37.385]  How can they control the carbon footprint of the world's citizens?
[00:26:38.245 --> 00:26:45.249]  Very soon, government will tell our farmers what they can grow and punish Australian consumers if they buy the wrong thing.
[00:26:45.809 --> 00:26:54.795]  The dream of micromanaging individual carbon emissions hinges on the soon-to-be-passed so-called Trusted Digital Identity Bill.
[00:26:55.595 --> 00:27:03.641]   If Scott Morrison and Barnaby Joyce want to achieve their net zero 2050 dream, Freedoms must be slashed, removed.
[00:27:04.101 --> 00:27:11.449]  It is only through the relentless digital stalking of citizens that the Liberal Nationals Government can micromanage purchasing choices.
[00:27:11.969 --> 00:27:16.474]  Businesses are punished with tax, while consumers get their credit score docked.
[00:27:17.612 --> 00:27:25.581]  This already happens in China, where a person's shopping list lowers their social credit score until they cannot travel.
[00:27:26.341 --> 00:27:32.047]  In Australia, it may be as simple as denying banking services because you dare to drive a four-wheel drive to work.
[00:27:32.828 --> 00:27:42.473]  Australian banks have already shown a keen interest in the trusted Digital Identity Bill, saying it will, quote, allow them to create a rich view of their customers.
[00:27:42.973 --> 00:27:48.275]  These are the same banks that already list climate risk as a means to deny loans.
[00:27:49.556 --> 00:27:59.501]  When the Liberals tell you that digital identity will make your life easier, remember, there is no such thing as a free lunch.
[00:28:01.004 --> 00:28:01.945]  This is the Mark of the Base.
[00:28:02.025 --> 00:28:03.106]  That's their main senator.
[00:28:03.546 --> 00:28:08.451]  Klaus Schwab's life by subscription, quote, is really serfdom.
[00:28:08.992 --> 00:28:09.672]  It's slavery.
[00:28:11.254 --> 00:28:14.257]  Billionaire globalist corporations will own everything.
[00:28:14.617 --> 00:28:18.180]  Homes, factories, farms, cars, furniture.
[00:28:19.682 --> 00:28:22.645]  And everyday citizens will rent what they need.
[00:28:24.066 --> 00:28:25.968]  If their social credit score allows.
[00:28:27.571 --> 00:28:31.553]  The plan of the Great Reset is that you will die with nothing.
[00:28:33.253 --> 00:28:40.157]  To pull off this evil plan, Klaus Schwab's World Economic Forum will need to take more than just material possessions from Australians.
[00:28:41.417 --> 00:28:49.341]  Senators in this very chamber today who support the Great Reset threaten our privacy, freedom and dignity.
[00:28:50.821 --> 00:28:52.282]  Yes, they're in this Senate chamber.
[00:28:54.048 --> 00:29:02.676]  One Nation vehemently opposes the Great Reset, the Digital Identity Bill, theft of agricultural land use, forcing farmers off their land, and all of the Great Reset.
[00:29:03.576 --> 00:29:07.660]  One Nation has a comprehensive plan to bring our beautiful country back to sustainable prosperity.
[00:29:08.681 --> 00:29:11.423]  And in the months ahead, we will be rolling that plan out.
[00:29:12.444 --> 00:29:21.332]  Instead of Lib Lab pushing Klaus Schwab's Great Reset with the tagline, you will own nothing and be happy, One Nation advocates the Great Resist.
[00:29:23.186 --> 00:29:31.810]  We stand for a world where individuals and communities have primacy over predatory globalist billionaires and their quizzling bureaucrats, politicians and mouthpiece media.
[00:29:33.671 --> 00:29:36.973]  One Nation accepts the challenge to provide a better future for everyday Australians.
[00:29:37.847 --> 00:29:43.051]  And one nation is one of the patriot anti-new world order parties growing very fast in Australia.
[00:29:43.071 --> 00:29:44.892]  That's what they're panicking trying to bring in total tyranny.
[00:29:45.232 --> 00:29:48.235]  Now the UN has openly announced their World ID digital system.
[00:29:48.575 --> 00:29:50.796]  I told you last year that had been adopted by China.
[00:29:51.117 --> 00:29:53.278]  The UN was in charge of it, but now they've officially rolled it out.
[00:29:53.619 --> 00:29:55.080]  I'll play that clip here in a moment, but first...
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:30:07.345]  Just like you see in Canada, just like you see in the Netherlands, just like you see in New Zealand and Australia, they're banning the first year 30% of the cows, the next year another 30%, so the cows are all banned because they're bad.
[00:30:07.645 --> 00:30:08.505]  They have carbon in them.
[00:30:08.966 --> 00:30:09.786]  They put off methane.
[00:30:10.586 --> 00:30:11.407]  It's good for the environment.
[00:30:12.987 --> 00:30:15.969]  And they're panicking and trying to accelerate this whole agenda.
[00:30:15.989 --> 00:30:16.609]  Here's part of the clip.
[00:30:18.891 --> 00:30:24.253]  While belching is widely considered to be rude, livestock don't seem to care.
[00:30:24.694 --> 00:30:26.334]  All day, every day, they burp.
[00:30:26.795 --> 00:30:29.076]  But it's not the act of burping that's the problem.
[00:30:29.256 --> 00:30:32.417]  It is the methane that they release into our atmosphere.
[00:30:33.078 --> 00:30:38.580]  The average cow emits a whopping 220 pounds of methane gas a day.
[00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:43.282]  Well, New Zealand is doing something about it by taxing burping livestock.
[00:30:43.842 --> 00:30:44.763]  Mike Drolet explains.
[00:30:47.022 --> 00:30:53.027]  With a population of just 5 million, New Zealand's carbon footprint is relatively small.
[00:30:53.248 --> 00:30:56.170]  Okay, so first they tell you carbon dioxide's bad.
[00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:58.533]  Now all gases out of animals is bad.
[00:30:58.973 --> 00:31:05.639]  All animals are burping and passing to the other end, flatulence, methane gas, other gases.
[00:31:05.859 --> 00:31:06.480]  This is insane.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:07.861]  But it's total control.
[00:31:08.181 --> 00:31:09.823]  And New Zealand's main export is what?
[00:31:10.223 --> 00:31:10.584]  Lamb.
[00:31:11.598 --> 00:31:12.338]  This is so sick.
[00:31:12.579 --> 00:31:25.586]  But let's end the hour with the UN officially, and it's also in documents they put out, announcing the new global standard they've got for the World ID, like Sri Lanka just put in, with rationing of food and gas, and it's a UN program running it.
[00:31:25.766 --> 00:31:26.127]  Here it is.
[00:31:27.587 --> 00:31:35.052]  Digital transformation is changing the way we manage our data, our information, our interactions, and our identities online.
[00:31:35.874 --> 00:31:52.168]  The United Nations is ready to digitally transform how it deals with identity, with a system to streamline information sharing, daily workflows, access to platforms and buildings, operating across agencies, by providing its personnel with a universal, system-wide identity solution.
[00:31:52.929 --> 00:31:54.930]  Introducing the UN Digital ID.
[00:31:55.511 --> 00:32:00.395]  A unique and digital identity for UN personnel, from the day you join, to the day you part.
[00:32:01.022 --> 00:32:11.232]  All of your personal, HR, medical, travel, security, payroll and pension data in the palm of your hand, giving you full control on what you share and with whom.
[00:32:11.733 --> 00:32:20.342]  With blockchain and biometrics, the UN Digital ID makes verification efficient, secure, transparent, immutable, portable and universal.
[00:32:21.042 --> 00:32:31.206]  It's been piloted by different agencies and the UN Pension Fund, where they've replaced current manual processes with certainty for who and where pension recipients say they are, at any given time.
[00:32:31.807 --> 00:32:34.308]  Imagine a regional field officer's just joined the UN.
[00:32:34.828 --> 00:32:41.631]  She uses the mobile app to obtain a digital wallet, stored securely in her smartphone and only accessible to her with biometrics.
[00:32:42.131 --> 00:32:48.473]  Even better than a physical wallet, she can store all her credentials issued by any UN organisation in her digital wallet.
[00:32:48.834 --> 00:32:56.336]  She has immediate access to course certificates, travel clearances from UNDSS, medical records from allergies to vaccinations.
[00:32:56.957 --> 00:33:00.218]  Also making any transfer to another organisation a breeze.
[00:33:00.878 --> 00:33:05.400]  As innovation transforms the world, we can improve the way we manage our identities online.
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:11.002]  UN Digital IDs, a building block for digital cooperation, unlocking the promise of the SDGs.
[00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:14.661]  And then you see that rainbow crescent symbol.
[00:33:14.681 --> 00:33:17.282]  That's the WEF's Great Reset symbol.
[00:33:17.663 --> 00:33:18.843]  That's the new swastika.
[00:33:18.883 --> 00:33:19.984]  This is their global party.
[00:33:20.464 --> 00:33:23.066]  And the UN admits they're going to use this all over the world for everybody else.
[00:33:23.346 --> 00:33:24.907]  They're just rolling it out first with their personnel.
[00:33:24.726 --> 00:33:33.966]  We'll be back with hour number two.
[00:33:33.966 --> 00:33:36.966]  [Music]
[00:33:35.054 --> 00:33:37.516]  We're being told it's to force us into a great transition.
[00:33:38.276 --> 00:33:39.437]  It's being done on purpose.
[00:33:40.097 --> 00:33:40.698]  Then they change.
[00:33:41.992 --> 00:33:45.992]   attack and say no it's Putin's fault or it's the gas station's fault.
[00:33:45.992 --> 00:33:48.992]  It's all part of this sick plan ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:48.992 --> 00:33:52.992]   Thanks for joining us on this live Sunday, July 31st broadcast.
[00:33:52.992 --> 00:33:56.992]   Got some domestic news on the Build Back Better UN Great Reset Takeover.
[00:33:56.992 --> 00:33:59.992]   There's a big monologue Tucker did Friday that's really powerful.
[00:33:59.992 --> 00:34:02.992]  It's up on Infowars.com but here's just 30 seconds of it.
[00:34:02.992 --> 00:34:05.992]  All the world's energy comes from fossil fuels.
[00:34:06.163 --> 00:34:06.143]  80%.
[00:34:07.785 --> 00:34:17.353]  Solar, on the other hand, provides 3% of the world's energy after many decades on the market and with the help of massive government subsidies.
[00:34:17.433 --> 00:34:19.174]  So it doesn't actually work.
[00:34:19.194 --> 00:34:20.255]  It doesn't come close to working.
[00:34:20.295 --> 00:34:21.717]  It's a boutique issue.
[00:34:21.777 --> 00:34:22.878]  It's ridiculous, actually.
[00:34:23.278 --> 00:34:25.240]  So why is the Biden administration pushing this?
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.881]  And who is benefiting from it?
[00:34:26.901 --> 00:34:29.003]  Well, a lot of people are getting rich from it, that's for sure.
[00:34:30.595 --> 00:34:33.896]  Yeah, insiders are making trillions overall, but that's only part of the plan.
[00:34:33.936 --> 00:34:35.656]  It's about cutting off infrastructure.
[00:34:35.696 --> 00:34:40.718]  Fossil fuels can barely supply what we need into the future, and the infrastructure is built for them.
[00:34:41.038 --> 00:34:42.058]  There is no replacement.
[00:34:42.938 --> 00:34:45.019]  They blocked all the new energy technologies.
[00:34:45.359 --> 00:34:52.060]  Solar and things are a joke compared to the technologies they have completely and totally suppressed.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.821]  They want a post-industrial world.
[00:34:54.121 --> 00:34:58.682]  They want you poor because they can't compete with populism and with capitalism.
[00:34:59.653 --> 00:35:01.155]  They can't compete in any way.
[00:35:01.996 --> 00:35:07.162]  And here's Manchin, absurdly claims Democrats' Green New Deal, which is just the U.N.
[00:35:07.182 --> 00:35:11.348]  Build Back Better tax and spending spree, will fight inflation.
[00:35:11.368 --> 00:35:14.772]  Everybody thinks Mnuchin, Manchin is a great guy.
[00:35:15.272 --> 00:35:16.754]  Wouldn't trust him as far as I can throw him.
[00:35:17.722 --> 00:35:21.463]  Meanwhile, gaslighting economist Paul Krugman dismisses U.S.
[00:35:21.503 --> 00:35:24.164]  recession, says term doesn't matter anymore.
[00:35:24.684 --> 00:35:26.465]  So first they said it wasn't a recession.
[00:35:26.945 --> 00:35:31.626]  Now they say it just doesn't matter anymore.
[00:35:32.207 --> 00:35:34.727]  No farmers, no food, no life.
[00:35:35.128 --> 00:35:37.528]  They're protesting all over the world.
[00:35:37.949 --> 00:35:43.830]  And all these leftist people make jokes about their private jets and how great they are.
[00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:44.831]  And they're not hurting the environment.
[00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:45.451]  I'm not against them.
[00:35:47.142 --> 00:35:54.586]  But then they say, you shouldn't be able to have children, you shouldn't have a car, you shouldn't have air conditioning, as Obama, seven years ago, told Africans.
[00:35:55.026 --> 00:35:55.667]  Pull the clip up.
[00:35:55.687 --> 00:35:57.808]  In fact, you can't play that clip enough, guys.
[00:35:58.148 --> 00:35:59.189]  Find the clip for next hour.
[00:35:59.529 --> 00:36:02.370]  Obama tells Africans they have to get rid of air conditioning and cars.
[00:36:04.611 --> 00:36:05.232]  They can't have them.
[00:36:05.732 --> 00:36:10.455]  But I'll tell you who isn't getting rid of his large, heavy, private jet that seats 40 people.
[00:36:12.025 --> 00:36:12.666]  And that's U.S.
[00:36:13.087 --> 00:36:17.252]  climate czar John Kerry slammed over family private jet emissions.
[00:36:18.354 --> 00:36:19.335]  Here is John Kerry.
[00:36:20.417 --> 00:36:26.826]  Rita, it's not just the celebrities, but it's also the government nomenclatura who are enjoying these private jets.
[00:36:26.846 --> 00:36:27.426]  John Kerry.
[00:36:27.898 --> 00:36:43.725]  Well yeah, John Kerry, the climate czar, his private jet takes him all over to climate summits around the world where he lectures everybody about how we can't possibly let these high crippling prices slow our progress to net zero.
[00:36:44.285 --> 00:36:44.706]  Of course...
[00:36:45.906 --> 00:36:46.987]  It is what we said before.
[00:36:47.087 --> 00:36:50.550]  All these policies are essentially Marxism.
[00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.713]  It's one rule for the elite, one rule for the rest.
[00:36:53.733 --> 00:36:56.615]  And it is the elite because I love this line from the story.
[00:36:56.675 --> 00:36:59.197]  It was Kerry's family jet.
[00:36:59.417 --> 00:37:03.320]  Imagine that, having a family Gulfstream, like a family station wagon.
[00:37:05.382 --> 00:37:08.705]  And the whole point is, these globalists don't drive around in cars.
[00:37:08.725 --> 00:37:10.846]  They're on helicopters and jets constantly.
[00:37:11.307 --> 00:37:19.344]   Like Drake will fly to his house 40 miles away on his, what, 767?
[00:37:19.985 --> 00:37:21.206]  What's that hold, like 80 people?
[00:37:22.847 --> 00:37:33.577]  So he's got a big jet, I mean a giant jet, and he flies to his house 40 miles away, because it takes him 5 minutes to get there, versus an hour driving 40 miles.
[00:37:35.083 --> 00:37:35.523]  In Canada.
[00:37:36.043 --> 00:37:39.324]  But he supports carbon taxes on you and your family.
[00:37:39.364 --> 00:37:42.605]  These people are greedy, evil, sickos.
[00:37:42.645 --> 00:37:44.545]  Like Ted Turner's got, what, six kids or whatever?
[00:37:44.886 --> 00:37:46.146]  He doesn't want you to be able to have any kids?
[00:37:46.846 --> 00:37:49.327]  He's got a fleet of jets and palaces everywhere?
[00:37:50.647 --> 00:37:52.367]  But where's the real attack happening?
[00:37:52.387 --> 00:37:53.268]  It's on our families.
[00:37:54.028 --> 00:38:01.770]  They targeted boys for the last 40 years with Ritalin and all these drugs that stunted their growth and made them mental patients as part of their attack on masculinity.
[00:38:02.981 --> 00:38:12.385]  And now they're targeting boys all over the world with puberty blockers particularly, which cause all sorts of health problems and all sorts of mental health problems.
[00:38:12.886 --> 00:38:15.167]  And they're not even approved for children, but they're doing it.
[00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:16.207]  This is a rollout.
[00:38:16.227 --> 00:38:17.908]  So a lot of people say is Tulsi Gabbard's good?
[00:38:19.278 --> 00:38:20.259]  Well, she's anti-war.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.881]  She's pro-First Amendment.
[00:38:22.282 --> 00:38:23.663]  She's becoming pro-Second Amendment.
[00:38:23.944 --> 00:38:27.929]  I'm just saying we should invite Democrats at least saying they support these ideas.
[00:38:28.469 --> 00:38:30.452]  I think she's better than most Republicans.
[00:38:30.472 --> 00:38:32.775]  There's a new article on Infowars.com by Jamie White.
[00:38:33.215 --> 00:38:37.420]  Tulsi Gabbard's transgender hormones are child abuse promoted by Biden administration.
[00:38:38.041 --> 00:38:41.363]  That's part of their big spending bill is billions to force us to push us.
[00:38:41.403 --> 00:38:44.364]  I gotta tell you, today I was driving around in Austin taking care of errands.
[00:38:44.824 --> 00:38:50.247]  I saw men dressed as women who all look super unhealthy and out of their minds everywhere.
[00:38:50.748 --> 00:38:56.110]  They're men that don't have jobs, don't have futures on average, and they've been told this is the trendy cool thing to do.
[00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:59.612]  Well, if men want to get caught up in this web, that's their issue.
[00:39:00.492 --> 00:39:02.994]  And some people feel like they're a woman and they want to do it as an adult.
[00:39:03.274 --> 00:39:03.894]  I'm not against them.
[00:39:04.114 --> 00:39:05.095]  People are mad at Trump.
[00:39:06.209 --> 00:39:14.293]  He's having Caitlyn Jenner to one of his events with AOC, not AOC, the conservative version of AOC, but better, MTG.
[00:39:15.474 --> 00:39:16.834]  What are you doing meeting with this person?
[00:39:17.615 --> 00:39:28.640]  Well at least Bruce Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, is against women having their sports taken over by men, and he's against targeting children, or she's against it.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:36.055]   I don't care if for PR and hype, Bruce Jenner got roped into that whole TV show he did.
[00:39:36.675 --> 00:39:38.976]  I don't support it, but I'm not saying he doesn't have a right to do it.
[00:39:39.456 --> 00:39:41.697]  At least he's not going after our children overtly.
[00:39:42.077 --> 00:39:43.978]  But here's Tulsi Gabbards laying it all out.
[00:39:47.099 --> 00:39:53.122]  The FDA made a disturbing but not at all surprising announcement just a few days ago about children's health.
[00:39:54.142 --> 00:40:01.125]  Now if you haven't heard about it or if you missed it, it's because the mainstream media and the Biden-Harris administration have been completely silent on it.
[00:40:02.222 --> 00:40:09.104]  This warning that the FDA issued is basically saying that puberty blockers can cause serious health risks for our kids.
[00:40:10.145 --> 00:40:23.709]  Unfortunately, at almost the exact same time the FDA issued this warning, Biden-Harris administration officials were making public statements actively promoting the use of puberty blockers and irreversible surgeries for kids.
[00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:25.689]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:30.311]  This administration is dangerously promoting child abuse.
[00:40:32.748 --> 00:40:33.870]  Yeah, it's child abuse.
[00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:41.320]  So for me, the Rubicon is targeting children with sterilization, be it castration or be it chemical sterilization.
[00:40:41.801 --> 00:40:47.469]  It is one of our red lines we've got to stand for and stand against them pushing this.
[00:40:47.509 --> 00:40:48.570]  Now, coming up next hour...
[00:40:49.548 --> 00:40:50.969]  We have a special guest at 15 After.
[00:40:51.329 --> 00:40:53.731]  But first, you think puberty blockers are bad for children.
[00:40:54.411 --> 00:41:04.317]  They are now estimating that a million children six months and older have been injected just since the FDA approved the experimental deadly COVID shots for them.
[00:41:04.337 --> 00:41:12.402]  And we've got some shocking numbers on this biological chemical holocaust.
[00:41:13.479 --> 00:41:13.939]  Coming up.
[00:41:13.979 --> 00:41:26.186]  But first, let me hit a couple of exciting items for all the TV viewers, all the radio listeners, because freedom is incredibly popular, and that's something that we should be celebrating.
[00:41:26.006 --> 00:41:32.925]  So can you get an overhead shot right here for me?
[00:41:32.925 --> 00:41:37.566]   This book, The Great Reset and The War for the World, written by yours truly.
[00:41:37.566 --> 00:41:47.565]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:41:38.919 --> 00:41:45.425]  He's now number 35 on the world charts ahead of Obama's new book and so much more.
[00:41:46.405 --> 00:41:48.167]  You can buy a signed copy or a regular copy.
[00:41:48.207 --> 00:41:51.029]  It comes out in late August at m4wrestore.com.
[00:41:51.049 --> 00:41:55.133]  We certainly need the funds, but it's an incredible book that lays out their entire battle plan.
[00:41:55.153 --> 00:41:58.375]  It is the plans for the Death Star New World Order and how to take it down.
[00:41:59.636 --> 00:42:01.178]  That's available at m4wrestore.com.
[00:42:01.958 --> 00:42:03.300]  Then we've got this.
[00:42:05.702 --> 00:42:07.063]  Top movies on Apple.
[00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:12.954]  Alex's war is listed as number six.
[00:42:13.975 --> 00:42:18.076]  They have the top three on the top of the apple chart, and then they have the ones under that.
[00:42:18.356 --> 00:42:21.757]  We are number six on the apple charts.
[00:42:21.797 --> 00:42:24.198]  Now, we don't make any money off this film, and that's fine.
[00:42:24.238 --> 00:42:25.338]  I agreed to the filmmakers.
[00:42:25.418 --> 00:42:29.480]  I think they did a pretty fair job, and it's a 28-year history of our battle against the New World Order.
[00:42:31.141 --> 00:42:34.323]  It's really going to wake a lot of folks up because they want to destroy me because they can destroy you.
[00:42:34.783 --> 00:42:37.045]  They can destroy a populist leader.
[00:42:37.065 --> 00:42:39.526]  They think they've got the keys to destroying us all.
[00:42:39.566 --> 00:42:54.896]  But the fact that the book is number one in so many categories and number 30-something in the world charts, the fact that Alex's War for Weeks was number two in the Apple pre-order charts and many other charts, the fact that it's going to the top of the charts everywhere is another signal of the global Great Awakening.
[00:42:55.277 --> 00:42:56.577]  Very, very exciting.
[00:42:56.858 --> 00:43:03.321]   I saw Twitter commenters were very Upset like my neighbor's keeper, Barack Obama is pushing his book for free!
[00:43:03.521 --> 00:43:17.887]  Yeah, the, like, Harari's book's for free, in a promo, and is probably sitting there looking at Alex's, Jones's number one book instead, and he's saying to himself, I could have hit him with a drone strike, but no, the general said it would be too obvious.
[00:43:18.347 --> 00:43:19.307]  His book is good though.
[00:43:19.787 --> 00:43:30.655]   To the left's talking about killing me, because liberty is so popular, and because in the history charts, we are number one, and Barack Obama is Number two for a week straight.
[00:43:31.337 --> 00:43:32.098]  Numbers, what, 34, 35?
[00:43:32.618 --> 00:43:33.138]  I forget.
[00:43:33.178 --> 00:43:34.139]  We'll cover it next hour.
[00:43:34.579 --> 00:43:36.601]  But that is a big deal in the world charts.
[00:43:36.621 --> 00:43:38.542]  I want to salute you and thank you all.
[00:43:38.862 --> 00:43:45.487]  Tell everybody, buy as many copies of the book as you can at Amazon as a political action and get a signed book at InfoWorksStore.com.
[00:43:45.527 --> 00:43:49.250]  And separately, Vitamineral Fusion, sold out for more than six months, is back in stock.
[00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:50.931]  Discount at InfoWorksStore.com.
[00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:54.394]  Our favorite toothpaste, Super Blue, finally back in stock.
[00:43:54.814 --> 00:44:00.178]  InfoWorksStore.com, 50% off when you get the Trifecta of toothpaste and bodies back in stock.
[00:44:00.498 --> 00:44:01.619]  Hour number two straight ahead.
[00:44:01.639 --> 00:44:10.746]  Stay with us.
[00:44:11.986 --> 00:44:13.508]  They want you to eat bugs.
[00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:16.690]  What to feed our ever expanding world?
[00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.671]  Insects.
[00:44:18.479 --> 00:44:19.539]  They could feed the world.
[00:44:19.999 --> 00:44:20.440]  Healthy.
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:24.120]  They're full of polyunsaturated fat, protein, and micronutrients.
[00:44:24.461 --> 00:44:25.341]  And sustainable.
[00:44:25.581 --> 00:44:30.342]  I'm Nicole Kidman, and I am going to eat a four-course meal of bugs.
[00:44:30.802 --> 00:44:38.624]  And they want you to eat these bugs inside a massive prison system that sees humanity as a cancer upon the earth.
[00:44:38.884 --> 00:44:44.646]  For too long, humanity has existed within dysfunctional and polluted cities that ignore nature.
[00:44:45.646 --> 00:44:49.487]  Now, a revolution in civilization is taking place.
[00:44:50.887 --> 00:44:55.208]  Imagine a traditional city and consolidating its footprint.
[00:44:55.288 --> 00:44:57.649]  Designing to protect and enhance nature.
[00:44:58.729 --> 00:45:05.051]  The Line will be home to 9 million residents and will be built with a footprint of just 34 square kilometers.
[00:45:06.091 --> 00:45:10.192]  And we are designing it to provide a healthier, more sustainable quality of life.
[00:45:11.672 --> 00:45:14.693]  The Line's communities are organized in three dimensions.
[00:45:16.135 --> 00:45:20.678]  Residents have access to all their daily needs within five-minute walk neighborhoods.
[00:45:22.019 --> 00:45:30.965]  And the line's infrastructure makes it possible to travel end-to-end in 20 minutes with no need for cars, resulting in zero carbon emissions.
[00:45:32.091 --> 00:45:38.857]  It is all completely bizarre, but it's just the cover story for a massive depopulation agenda.
[00:45:39.317 --> 00:45:51.227]  The COVID-19 vaccines are destroying the recipients' reproductive and immune systems, and killing people over time with mysterious structures growing within the vascular system.
[00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:55.990]  We are now seeing this all over the world, and it's just getting started.
[00:45:56.591 --> 00:46:04.257]  There is a whole cultural movement now emerging from the shadows that wants humanity to collectively commit suicide.
[00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:17.115]  This anti-human cult has been around for decades and outside of academia have had to tread quietly because much of humanity is opposed to mass murder.
[00:46:17.615 --> 00:46:27.801]  But now that we are in the midst of this cult's massive depopulation effort, they are coming out into the open to convince us that it would be best for most of us to die.
[00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:31.203]  We cannot hide away from human population growth.
[00:46:31.963 --> 00:46:35.266]  Because, you know, it underlies so many of the other problems.
[00:46:35.306 --> 00:46:43.073]  All these things we talk about wouldn't be a problem if there was the size of population that there was 500 years ago.
[00:46:43.093 --> 00:46:46.997]  All the religious groups are against me because I'm talking about population.
[00:46:47.698 --> 00:46:48.639]  They want more souls.
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:50.841]  I want less on the planet.
[00:46:54.541 --> 00:47:01.949]  The World Economic Forum has become the public domain of the anti-human cult's depopulation agenda.
[00:47:02.449 --> 00:47:07.234]  And all of pop culture is on board, from Hollywood to the Holy See.
[00:47:07.674 --> 00:47:13.500]  Our planet, the utopia that we've been given, the overpopulation.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:21.705]  Their agenda is disguised as environmentalism, so that all who oppose it now can be shamed.
[00:47:22.185 --> 00:47:29.271]  And when the mass starvation begins to overwhelm the population, the sentimental environmentalists can all be blamed.
[00:47:29.951 --> 00:47:33.314]  Because of course, this has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:47:34.134 --> 00:47:38.256]  Boris Johnson's father, Stanley Johnson, is a member of this cult.
[00:47:38.816 --> 00:47:44.138]  And he wrote that the world's population needs to be cut down to a more manageable number.
[00:47:44.678 --> 00:47:46.378]  And this is what it's all about.
[00:47:46.558 --> 00:47:48.159]  A more manageable number.
[00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:52.361]  Because these psychopaths see the rest of us as their property.
[00:47:52.881 --> 00:47:55.081]  To manage and cull accordingly.
[00:47:55.762 --> 00:47:57.562]  But humanity still has a choice.
[00:47:58.163 --> 00:48:01.764]  And we don't have to die in a prison death factory eating bugs.
[00:48:02.564 --> 00:48:06.008]  We could choose freedom, but time is running out.
[00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:09.532]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:48:10.052 --> 00:48:17.340]  If you want to live, learn about the New World Order, learn about the Great Reset, learn about the transhumanists, and say no to every part of their agenda.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.222]  There's not much time left, folks.
[00:48:19.542 --> 00:48:20.884]  We're already in the attack phase.
[00:48:21.124 --> 00:48:23.124]  We'll be right back.
[00:48:23.124 --> 00:48:27.124]  [Music]
[00:48:27.124 --> 00:48:32.124]   We're now into hour number two of this historic Sunday, July 31st worldwide transmission.
[00:48:32.893 --> 00:48:33.773]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:48:33.793 --> 00:48:35.573]  Special guests joining us to tell you about when they join us.
[00:48:36.113 --> 00:48:36.694]  Next segment.
[00:48:37.294 --> 00:48:45.056]  So Tulsi Gabbards, that in the weight of what she's done on both sides, I would say I believe is a good person finding her soul.
[00:48:45.076 --> 00:48:46.356]  I feel like it's better and better.
[00:48:46.376 --> 00:48:47.476]  I don't think she's a Trojan horse.
[00:48:48.136 --> 00:48:49.097]  I think she's the real deal.
[00:48:49.497 --> 00:48:58.296]   And I just see a beautiful soul in her and I just see her waking up and transcending I have been told by folks very close to her, we haven't reached out to her, that she is a listener.
[00:48:59.256 --> 00:49:03.140]  But we need to be ready for the left to wake up and not be part of what they've been part of.
[00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:16.511]  And she's come out, just like Elon Musk has, against the depopulation agenda, against the New World Order, and against hormone blockers in children, which in all the studies cause massive health problems.
[00:49:16.571 --> 00:49:23.437]  And she came out and said, why has the FDA, we played it last hour, authorized something that in the literature is highly destructive?
[00:49:26.684 --> 00:49:28.345]  Not to mention it makes you not even grow.
[00:49:30.005 --> 00:49:30.725]  Stunts your growth.
[00:49:32.886 --> 00:49:33.226]  Why?
[00:49:34.907 --> 00:49:36.988]  Well, it's because the FDA has always been corrupt.
[00:49:38.828 --> 00:49:40.249]  But now it's completely weaponized.
[00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:49.132]  You know, I was actually proud of the FDA two years ago when they were trying to authorize the poison gene therapy injections that we'll play clips of here in a moment.
[00:49:50.032 --> 00:49:50.892]  From the head of Pfizer.
[00:49:52.513 --> 00:49:54.133]  Making incredible statements this week.
[00:49:55.354 --> 00:50:03.999]   When The majority of the board of the FDA, top scientists, said no to this vaccine.
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.921]  So they had that board resign, or those that were against it.
[00:50:07.361 --> 00:50:11.804]  Then the next board said no to booster shots and no to 16 and below.
[00:50:12.424 --> 00:50:13.725]  So they made that board resign.
[00:50:14.905 --> 00:50:18.848]  Then they said more booster shots and six and up.
[00:50:19.368 --> 00:50:20.189]  This is all on record.
[00:50:21.329 --> 00:50:22.010]  They resigned.
[00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:24.271]  And finally they got a board.
[00:50:26.516 --> 00:50:29.958]  The board before last member said, well, we just decided to see what would happen.
[00:50:29.978 --> 00:50:30.518]  No testing.
[00:50:30.578 --> 00:50:31.339]  And they started laughing.
[00:50:31.359 --> 00:50:31.659]  Remember that?
[00:50:33.079 --> 00:50:33.680]  One of the board members.
[00:50:38.022 --> 00:50:47.267]  And so they finally got a board that unanimously voted six months up to give them a shot that annihilates your immune system and is linked to heart attacks, cancer, infertility, you name it.
[00:50:47.487 --> 00:50:48.547]  And all the studies are out now.
[00:50:48.948 --> 00:50:50.829]  Even Tucker Carlson showing the mainline studies.
[00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.589]  God bless them.
[00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:57.360]   And even Brett Barr or whatever his name is on Fox, we've got those clips.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:51:01.481]  I mean, everything we said two years ago has been proven right, it's now in the open.
[00:51:01.641 --> 00:51:06.702]  We had CDC documents that would destroy your immune system and cause cancer and blood clots in October up to 2020!
[00:51:06.862 --> 00:51:10.263]  I mean, it's not like I'm just up here saying this stuff.
[00:51:11.023 --> 00:51:13.684]  We had the chief scientist at Pfizer who retired a year before this happened.
[00:51:14.024 --> 00:51:18.785]  Michael Yeadon coming out and predicting every damn bit of it and filing emergency lawsuits in the European Union.
[00:51:21.086 --> 00:51:24.447]  He says it's a depopulation plan, world government, he was in there with them.
[00:51:28.618 --> 00:51:30.920]  So when you look at that, you understand this agenda.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.481]  So look at these headlines.
[00:51:33.662 --> 00:51:35.864]  Biden tests positive for COVID again in two weeks.
[00:51:36.184 --> 00:51:37.865]  He's been tested twice and positive.
[00:51:38.166 --> 00:51:39.507]  Goes back into isolation.
[00:51:40.427 --> 00:51:44.050]  Biden's back-to-back COVID diagnosis undermined the administration's narrative of his health.
[00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:47.153]  The supposed drug he took to stop reinfection didn't work.
[00:51:47.433 --> 00:51:49.134]  And the insert says it doesn't work.
[00:51:49.194 --> 00:51:49.835]  But he said it's 100%.
[00:51:49.875 --> 00:51:53.818]  They still push it though.
[00:51:56.317 --> 00:52:01.161]  Ineffective Pfizer COVID drug, Paxavoid, doesn't work.
[00:52:02.662 --> 00:52:03.543]  Big study on this.
[00:52:03.643 --> 00:52:10.968]  UK government report and excess deaths data from COVID vaccination says on average it takes five months to kill you.
[00:52:11.749 --> 00:52:12.509]  If it is going to kill you.
[00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:17.313]  DC schools expand COVID vaccine mandate unlike most other districts.
[00:52:17.673 --> 00:52:22.177]  Yeah, it's illegal to make people take an experimental shot, but they're doing it, mainly black kids.
[00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:28.771]  Making the vaccine experience easier for your little ones, reports the news, NBC.
[00:52:30.231 --> 00:52:31.532]  And it goes on and on.
[00:52:31.832 --> 00:52:33.952]  Look at this poor little black child being injected with that.
[00:52:33.972 --> 00:52:35.813]  It's gonna mess him up for life.
[00:52:36.833 --> 00:52:39.053]  I mean, this is sick, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:40.534 --> 00:52:49.332]   Quadruple vax, Biden test positive for COVID, but unvaccinated COVID recovered, Jovovix, Novak Djokovic can't play in the U.S.
[00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:49.653]  Open.
[00:52:49.933 --> 00:52:51.534]  He's apparently too big a risk to the U.S.
[00:52:51.574 --> 00:52:52.154]  healthcare system.
[00:52:52.174 --> 00:52:55.577]  Remember, all these countries have forced injection, and to get in the U.S.
[00:52:55.617 --> 00:52:57.558]  now, you've got to have it unless you're an illegal alien.
[00:52:59.319 --> 00:53:06.465]  Novak Djokovic winning this year's Wimbledon after everything went wrong is the stuff of legend.
[00:53:07.162 --> 00:53:14.567]  Djokovic said, I want to take a moment and say to all of you how grateful I am to see so many messages of support and love from around the world these days.
[00:53:15.307 --> 00:53:17.869]  I wasn't expecting it, and that's why it feels so mind-blowing.
[00:53:18.089 --> 00:53:19.109]  Just wanted to say thank you.
[00:53:19.530 --> 00:53:20.170]  He's a real leader.
[00:53:21.511 --> 00:53:25.073]  Meanwhile, Chicago healthcare worker class action lawsuit wins $10.3 million.
[00:53:25.914 --> 00:53:27.975]  They're being fired for not taking an experimental shot.
[00:53:28.395 --> 00:53:28.935]  It's illegal.
[00:53:29.196 --> 00:53:30.296]  And then I see these articles.
[00:53:30.316 --> 00:53:31.337]  This is where it really is chilling.
[00:53:31.757 --> 00:53:32.598]  Every day now.
[00:53:33.908 --> 00:53:34.428]  Hundreds of them.
[00:53:34.448 --> 00:53:37.529]  On the sides of buses, they say, heart attacks hit children now.
[00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:40.930]  Yeah, heart attacks are up several thousand percentage points in children.
[00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:42.190]  Here we go.
[00:53:42.591 --> 00:53:46.652]  Experts now warn COVID... I'm having a Freudian slip.
[00:53:47.252 --> 00:53:47.852]  Here we go.
[00:53:47.952 --> 00:53:52.914]  Experts now warn cold showers are causing heart attacks in young adults.
[00:53:53.834 --> 00:53:59.635]  Other articles about a college student dropped dead, skinny and healthy, because he was so happy he got a good grade.
[00:54:00.236 --> 00:54:01.096]  He died of joy.
[00:54:03.288 --> 00:54:07.630]  College basketball star Derek Gray, dead at 20, collapses heart attack on the floor.
[00:54:07.650 --> 00:54:12.653]  27-year-old triathlete, doctor in Canada, dies four days after she collapses while swimming.
[00:54:13.394 --> 00:54:15.715]  Fifth GTA doctor dies within two weeks.
[00:54:17.116 --> 00:54:18.717]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:54:19.137 --> 00:54:22.719]  Young doctor, 27-year-olds, die after taking the shot.
[00:54:23.139 --> 00:54:26.381]  There's another doctor, died in the same town in Canada, after taking the shot.
[00:54:27.685 --> 00:54:35.710]  CDC unusually large number of newborns infected with potentially life-threatening virus that could trigger fever, poor feeding and seizures, and the mothers have been injected.
[00:54:37.751 --> 00:54:39.993]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:54:40.013 --> 00:54:46.017]  I've got stacks of death certificates, you name it, of children and people that took the shots.
[00:54:47.854 --> 00:54:53.217]  It is a holocaust and they're just normalizing the whole thing in real time.
[00:54:53.677 --> 00:54:54.897]  But I want to air these clips.
[00:54:54.997 --> 00:54:56.438]  This is the head of Pfizer.
[00:54:57.118 --> 00:55:00.600]  There's a bunch of these Pfizer clips.
[00:55:02.421 --> 00:55:03.261]  They got two clips.
[00:55:03.321 --> 00:55:04.162]  Pfizer CEO.
[00:55:05.678 --> 00:55:07.219]  About the courage it took.
[00:55:07.259 --> 00:55:07.940]  Yeah, let's play that.
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:08.881]  The courage.
[00:55:08.901 --> 00:55:15.386]  The courage to push an untested shot they'd really secretly tested, knowing what it would do, cause heart attacks, infertility.
[00:55:15.627 --> 00:55:17.768]  Here he is, rolling the dice, he claims.
[00:55:17.849 --> 00:55:18.749]  Well, he wasn't rolling the dice.
[00:55:19.570 --> 00:55:24.754]  Launching this nanotech gene therapy weapon.
[00:55:24.774 --> 00:55:25.095]  Here it is.
[00:55:25.930 --> 00:55:31.295]  Well, that's quite an accomplishment, especially for a company as old and as large.
[00:55:31.775 --> 00:55:32.956]  And you mentioned courage.
[00:55:33.817 --> 00:55:40.583]  Making the decision to pursue the mRNA technology was really bold and risky, and you were actually an original skeptic.
[00:55:41.323 --> 00:55:45.107]  So share with us how you made that decision, especially given the stakes.
[00:55:47.834 --> 00:55:51.116]  Basically, it was trusting my people.
[00:55:51.556 --> 00:56:01.819]  When they told me mRNA is our solution to what you are asking us to do, which is we want the vaccine very effective, very safe, very quickly.
[00:56:03.958 --> 00:56:04.598]  I was puzzled.
[00:56:04.798 --> 00:56:06.519]  That was a very counterintuitive decision.
[00:56:06.539 --> 00:56:09.781]  You know, Moderna is very good in doing mRNA.
[00:56:10.582 --> 00:56:14.204]  So for them, the decision would be only, are we doing a vaccine for COVID or not?
[00:56:14.644 --> 00:56:17.586]  Would never be what technology to use because this is what they are very good.
[00:56:18.146 --> 00:56:24.590]  In our case, we were using, we were very good in multiple different technological platform that would give a vaccine.
[00:56:24.610 --> 00:56:27.632]  So that was the number one decision that we had to make.
[00:56:28.603 --> 00:56:32.765]  And there was no other medicine or vaccine.
[00:56:34.213 --> 00:56:39.375]  Uh, that was successful, uh, by the time that we made the decision.
[00:56:39.395 --> 00:56:40.035]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:56:40.275 --> 00:56:53.260]  So, so, they lie to you and say it's effective, they say it's tested, he has courage to release it on us, then it doesn't work, and even Burke's, Trump's top advisor now says we lied to Trump, we knew it wouldn't work.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:56.521]  So they knew it wouldn't work, and they did it, but what does it work at?
[00:56:57.061 --> 00:56:59.022]  Erasing your immune system.
[00:56:59.482 --> 00:57:02.143]  Ab-so-lutely incredible.
[00:57:03.015 --> 00:57:06.540]  We're going to come back with a live guest on air with some really important news.
[00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:16.073]  But in post, when we post the full show tonight to Band.Video, add the other clip of the CEO making other bizarre statements.
[00:57:17.555 --> 00:57:19.117]  Because I want people to see that information.
[00:57:19.418 --> 00:57:19.658]  Wow!
[00:57:20.506 --> 00:57:22.306]  Just unbelievable.
[00:57:22.326 --> 00:57:25.207]  Oh, it took courage to make your children guinea pigs.
[00:57:25.587 --> 00:57:28.748]  It took courage to buy off the FDA and fire three boards.
[00:57:29.228 --> 00:57:31.449]  It took courage to ram this down the throat.
[00:57:31.469 --> 00:57:32.429]  He says it in the other clip.
[00:57:32.789 --> 00:57:34.210]  Oh, America was so good.
[00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:35.050]  They're the only one doing it.
[00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:36.730]  Yeah, we're the captured country.
[00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:37.731]  We're the enemy of the globalists.
[00:57:37.971 --> 00:57:38.851]  And we're being killed.
[00:57:39.011 --> 00:57:43.932]  And they hope you can't admit it's happening because the horror of this is too insane.
[00:57:44.292 --> 00:57:46.493]  They just hope you roll over to die with your children.
[00:57:46.733 --> 00:57:50.295]  Well, we're not gonna roll up and die, you Jeffrey Epstein monsters!
[00:57:50.515 --> 00:57:51.816]  We've only begun to fight!
[00:57:54.117 --> 00:58:11.487]  We were lucky because at the time of the most important, the most severe health crisis of the century, we were having a thriving life sciences sector, particularly in the U.S.
[00:58:11.587 --> 00:58:12.808]  That's why everything came from the U.S.
[00:58:14.059 --> 00:58:20.907]  And that was thriving life sciences sector was an ecosystem of private mainly.
[00:58:21.983 --> 00:58:46.693]  Institutions, private academia, private big pharma, private biotech, that in collaboration, all together, they were able to bring solutions for diagnostics, and then for treatments, and then for vaccines, even for respirators, when you had the companies that were making cars, being able to mobilize their resources within a month or so to be able to make respirators.
[00:58:46.753 --> 00:58:52.535]   So that, I think, stood out as something that It's what worked well.
[00:58:52.595 --> 00:59:05.102]  So if I think for the future, I think it's for the benefit of humanity to make sure that we create an environment that this life-sizing sector will flourish even more in the future.
[00:59:05.483 --> 00:59:20.192]  So we'll be able not only to address future dangers like pandemics, but also now that we know that it can, things can work differently to be able to bring medicines for cancer, for Alzheimer's, for Parkinson's, you name it, way faster.
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:23.060]  So that's I think what we work with.
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:25.640]  (upbeat music)
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:30.499]   By the way, that clip of Obama saying, "Ban cars and air conditioners for Africans,"
[00:59:30.499 --> 00:59:33.260]  we'll play that coming up in about 20 minutes.
[00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:37.380]  But right now, I've known this guy probably 20 years.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:42.300]   They've had the most courage out there to publish books that nobody else will publish,
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:47.099]   and they've become one of the most successful publishing houses in North America,
[00:59:47.099 --> 00:59:49.500]  if not the world, at Skyhorse Publishing.
[00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:55.540]   And they approached me six, seven, eight months ago and said, "We want you to write a great reset book."
[00:59:55.304 --> 00:59:56.544]  You're really the expert on it.
[00:59:57.225 --> 00:59:59.627]  And they approached me before about writing books and I hadn't done it.
[01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:06.932]  And I said, well, if I can get recordings together and all the documents and put together an outline, can you guys help me get it done?
[01:00:07.112 --> 01:00:11.355]  And they did it and it came out even more powerful than I thought it would.
[01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:16.118]  And we worked a lot on tweaking it and, you know, adding up to date last minute stuff.
[01:00:16.619 --> 01:00:18.040]  This book comes out in late August.
[01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:31.304]  It's already in the top of the top 50 charts on Amazon, number one in more than 20 areas like World History and History, above Obama's new book, above Harari's world government book, The Great Reset.
[01:00:31.324 --> 01:00:37.926]  I wanted to get him on to talk about this because not only was Alex's War a film I didn't produce, but I think it's a fair film, shows the good, the bad, and the ugly.
[01:00:38.506 --> 01:00:43.207]  Not only was it number two in the last two weeks on pre-order, now it's in the top six.
[01:00:43.247 --> 01:00:45.868]  It's the sixth hottest thing on Apple iTunes.
[01:00:46.848 --> 01:00:50.210]  Right below all these major Hollywood films that just came out.
[01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:54.673]  As you can see, the new Lord of the Rings, all these new horror movies.
[01:00:55.113 --> 01:00:55.834]  We are number six.
[01:00:55.854 --> 01:00:58.576]  There's three on the top, and then you can see we're right there.
[01:00:59.016 --> 01:01:00.977]  So that shows people are really hungry for the truth.
[01:01:01.297 --> 01:01:02.878]  I don't make any money off Alex's war.
[01:01:02.898 --> 01:01:03.699]  We need money right now.
[01:01:03.739 --> 01:01:04.579]  We're in bankruptcy.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.281]  We could shut down, but I want to explain what bankruptcy means.
[01:01:08.301 --> 01:01:08.922]  It's not bankruptcy.
[01:01:10.163 --> 01:01:12.604]  This is reorganization bankruptcy to stay open.
[01:01:13.144 --> 01:01:20.665]   So with all these lawsuits and all these attacks, The court will see how much money we have, and we'll see we don't have the $150 million they're asking for.
[01:01:20.925 --> 01:01:22.826]  We don't have $5 million extra dollars.
[01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:24.026]  We don't have $2 million extra dollars.
[01:01:24.566 --> 01:01:31.808]  Our whole operating capital is less than $4 million, and a company this big with employees who've got to buy product out in the future and everything, that's insolvency.
[01:01:32.388 --> 01:01:36.929]  So, if you buy the products at InfoWareStore.com, you can buy the book there, you can get a signed copy.
[01:01:37.169 --> 01:01:38.330]  I really want you to buy it on Amazon.
[01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:40.891]   It says, number one, That will keep us on air.
[01:01:40.951 --> 01:01:41.912]  We will not go anywhere.
[01:01:41.932 --> 01:01:42.993]  That's why there's bankruptcy.
[01:01:43.413 --> 01:01:49.498]  But it's just so they can't lie and say, I've got myself, you know, Jones made $76 million in 2019.
[01:01:49.699 --> 01:01:51.580]  We didn't gross that in 2019.
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.841]  These are lies.
[01:01:53.182 --> 01:01:54.122]  And we're wholesalers.
[01:01:54.403 --> 01:01:56.625]  So I may sell $30 million of food in a year.
[01:01:57.622 --> 01:02:05.666]  We get less than 10 million in operational funds, and because we have our own bandwidth and our own cost, hundreds of thousands a month in cost for just the bandwidth.
[01:02:05.686 --> 01:02:06.827]  We are very successful.
[01:02:06.847 --> 01:02:09.609]  5, 6, 7, 8 million videos watched today.
[01:02:09.729 --> 01:02:10.869]  That cost money.
[01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:12.570]  So we are in the fight.
[01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:13.471]  We're the tip of the spear.
[01:02:14.251 --> 01:02:27.316]   And I just want to salute Tony Lyons because this guy is fearless and this guy took my recordings and my research and the clips I sent him and how I wanted it done and made it better than I could have.
[01:02:27.877 --> 01:02:28.157]  Okay?
[01:02:29.457 --> 01:02:31.538]  And so this is the great reset book.
[01:02:32.078 --> 01:02:40.902]  Coming in the next segment we'll air a little trailer that Steve Bannon put out saying the most important intellectual book for freedom since the founding fathers.
[01:02:41.182 --> 01:02:41.882]  And I gotta say it.
[01:02:43.666 --> 01:02:47.730]  The credit goes to Tony Lyons and his researchers that we're going to mention here.
[01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:49.111]  It's not ghostwritten.
[01:02:49.331 --> 01:02:50.092]  It's my recordings.
[01:02:50.132 --> 01:02:50.833]  It's my words.
[01:02:50.913 --> 01:02:51.914]  It's my clips.
[01:02:51.994 --> 01:02:52.434]  I sent them.
[01:02:52.494 --> 01:02:54.416]  But he had lawyers involved.
[01:02:54.476 --> 01:02:54.996]  You name it.
[01:02:55.657 --> 01:02:56.698]  They took it next level.
[01:02:56.778 --> 01:03:00.682]  This thing is the Death Star plans and how to defeat the globalists.
[01:03:01.042 --> 01:03:03.224]  So, Tony Lyons, we want to salute you.
[01:03:03.623 --> 01:03:08.023]   He's the president publisher at Skyhorse and an attorney, was publisher at Lions Press
[01:03:08.023 --> 01:03:10.443]  between 2007 and 2004.
[01:03:10.443 --> 01:03:14.763]   He founded Skyhorse in 2006, has been involved in every aspect of the Bush publishing process
[01:03:14.763 --> 01:03:18.802]   starting with a small team of people, some of whom still work at Skyhorse because I know
[01:03:18.802 --> 01:03:19.802]  him, yeah it's true.
[01:03:19.802 --> 01:03:23.962]   Tony has steadily built a company from the start up, an increasingly prominent mid-sized
[01:03:23.962 --> 01:03:27.723]  publisher and he joins us right now, SkyhorsePublishing.com.
[01:03:27.956 --> 01:03:30.177]  Tony, all I can say is congratulations.
[01:03:30.757 --> 01:03:33.778]  And gosh, I'm glad I find it, because I had a lot of other book deals I turned down.
[01:03:34.079 --> 01:03:40.322]  Thank God I went with you, because what you did, what we did together is simply, is groundbreaking.
[01:03:40.582 --> 01:03:43.804]  And I believe if people get behind it, it'll go to number one.
[01:03:44.084 --> 01:03:45.484]  And culturally, that's so important.
[01:03:47.385 --> 01:03:48.226]  I think that's true.
[01:03:48.286 --> 01:03:52.408]  You know, this is the most controversial book coming out this year.
[01:03:53.689 --> 01:03:54.690]  There's no question.
[01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:56.271]  The most controversial book.
[01:03:56.652 --> 01:03:58.073]  They're going to try to shut it down.
[01:03:58.533 --> 01:04:00.295]  They don't want you to read this book.
[01:04:00.335 --> 01:04:02.777]  They're afraid of the revelations in this book.
[01:04:03.178 --> 01:04:05.720]  And they're going to censor it in every conceivable way.
[01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.243]  So the thing to do now is to buy it right now.
[01:04:09.403 --> 01:04:11.065]  Push it to the top of the list.
[01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:27.408]  So that everybody has to carry it, that they know that this book is there, that it's not going to go away, that you're not going to go away, that you're a patriot, that you're fighting for what's right, and that we don't deserve censorship in this country.
[01:04:27.908 --> 01:04:34.211]  We have fought and died for freedom in this country, and we need to fight to protect freedom in this country.
[01:04:34.531 --> 01:04:35.992]  And that's what your book is about.
[01:04:36.112 --> 01:04:38.433]  It's about combating the Great Reset.
[01:04:38.793 --> 01:04:40.734]  This is a book that people need to read.
[01:04:41.175 --> 01:04:45.957]  If they disagree with it, if people disagree with it, they should make an argument against it.
[01:04:46.077 --> 01:04:47.197]  They shouldn't censor it.
[01:04:47.498 --> 01:04:48.958]  They shouldn't de-platform it.
[01:04:49.259 --> 01:04:51.360]  They shouldn't write hit pieces against you.
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.122]  They should buy The Great Reset and The War for the World by Alex Jones.
[01:04:56.802 --> 01:04:59.364]  And they should decide for themselves.
[01:04:59.504 --> 01:05:02.105]  People should decide for themselves what they believe.
[01:05:02.465 --> 01:05:05.807]  And if they have better arguments, they should make those arguments.
[01:05:05.847 --> 01:05:08.909]  But this is an important book, and I highly recommend it.
[01:05:09.429 --> 01:05:12.171]  And, you know, buying it is an act of rebellion.
[01:05:12.531 --> 01:05:16.693]  Because, like I said, they're going to try to shut it down in every conceivable way.
[01:05:17.674 --> 01:05:30.580]   All I can say is, as the edits came in the last six months, as we wrote chapter to chapter, I thought I knew everything about The Great Reset, but your team would recommend this, recommend that, agency this, what about this idea, and just this collaboration.
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.142]  I'd love to say I wrote this book 100% myself.
[01:05:33.182 --> 01:05:51.506]   No, you guys really, I can't believe how much more powerful you guys made it, and then I was reading this, the final version, like two weeks ago, and then Steve Bannon came out and said, this is one of the most important books since The Founding Fathers, and I sat back and I went, It really is the, like I said, it's the blueprint of the Death Star.
[01:05:51.886 --> 01:05:54.109]  This is how they're doing it and how to stop them.
[01:05:54.269 --> 01:05:56.151]  I am just, thank you so much, Tony.
[01:05:56.431 --> 01:06:04.841]  How the hell with your team, because you took my recordings and 20 hours recordings and all the stuff I sent you and all the meetings we had and you did this.
[01:06:04.901 --> 01:06:05.542]  This is incredible.
[01:06:07.290 --> 01:06:08.131]  Thanks so much, yeah.
[01:06:08.191 --> 01:06:16.596]  I mean, this is a book that's already got great blurbs by, you know, Tucker Carlson, Mike Adams, Dr. Mercola, lots of people.
[01:06:16.636 --> 01:06:18.557]  I mean, this is an important book.
[01:06:19.097 --> 01:06:28.723]  You know, it's a book that people have to read and think through, and they have to realize that it's not going to be covered in any mainstream newspaper.
[01:06:29.023 --> 01:06:32.665]  It might not be available in, you know, libraries.
[01:06:32.785 --> 01:06:34.746]  Yeah, Tucker Carlson gave it a great quote.
[01:06:34.826 --> 01:06:35.647]  I mean, it's awesome.
[01:06:37.486 --> 01:06:41.750]  Tucker Carlson, you know, said, let's see what he said exactly.
[01:06:42.251 --> 01:06:47.356]  He said, why are the most powerful people in the country trying to silence Alex Jones?
[01:06:48.017 --> 01:06:51.140]  Read this book and decide for yourself.
[01:06:51.815 --> 01:06:53.075]  So that's the thing.
[01:06:53.215 --> 01:06:53.995]  Read this book.
[01:06:54.175 --> 01:07:07.538]  Read The Great Reset and decide for yourself whether the things that you, Alex Jones, have described are really happening and whether, you know, we can all get together to fight them, to fight for freedom.
[01:07:07.578 --> 01:07:09.298]  So this is like a battle cry.
[01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:17.120]  This is a book that people need to read and they need to recognize that a lot of people are going to come out with hit pieces, with reasons not to read it.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.601]  They're going to not address any of the claims in the book.
[01:07:20.921 --> 01:07:23.362]  They're just going to go after you personally, Alex.
[01:07:23.402 --> 01:07:24.562]  They might come after me.
[01:07:25.182 --> 01:07:39.626]  But, you know, the reason that we publish books and the reason that people should read books is to learn something new, is to get out of your own kind of footprints and look at things and really think them through for yourself.
[01:07:40.086 --> 01:07:45.228]  We live in a democracy and we can't just let ideas that are... Tony, stay right there.
[01:07:47.489 --> 01:07:52.917]  Grabbed up these silent star circuits today Can I decode?
[01:07:52.836 --> 01:07:56.836]  My whole life spins into a frenzy.
[01:07:56.836 --> 01:08:06.836]   And my friend to the twilight zone, This is the madhouse, feels like he's gone.
[01:08:06.836 --> 01:08:13.496]   Again, we're at the top of the charts in more than 20 areas like history, world history, fascism, media, you name it on
[01:08:13.496 --> 01:08:13.836]  Amazon.
[01:08:14.099 --> 01:08:17.102]  It's already in the top 50 of overall books in the world.
[01:08:17.502 --> 01:08:21.987]  Here's a little two-minute piece with Steve Bannon last week talking about the Great Reset and the New World Order.
[01:08:26.081 --> 01:08:36.548]  I gotta tell you, this book, The Great Reset and The War for the World, the left and the mainstream media are going to have to sit there, and we've got to force them to respond to this book.
[01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:39.050]  This book is that important.
[01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:40.991]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[01:08:41.392 --> 01:08:55.007]   If you compare the finest, and I'm telling you, you take MIT Technology Review, you take Science, take all these magazines and journals, add the electronic part of it, and, you know, NPR, PBS, all of it, I'll take it.
[01:08:55.107 --> 01:09:02.134]  I'll match up and I will go through and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[01:09:02.375 --> 01:09:06.459]  And if you're a sentient human being and just watching it, you say, well, God, Alex Jones was ahead of this.
[01:09:06.499 --> 01:09:07.660]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:10.002]  They're just in this huge revolution.
[01:09:10.623 --> 01:09:17.422]   against choice and free will and normal technological development and adoption of technology that empowers
[01:09:17.422 --> 01:09:18.123]  humanity.
[01:09:18.123 --> 01:09:25.623]   Instead, they want adoption of technology, forced adoption, world IDs, global social credit scores, carbon taxes,
[01:09:25.623 --> 01:09:28.623]  that dominate and monitor every facet of our lives.
[01:09:28.623 --> 01:09:33.123]   You make the case of what the not just the new world order is,
[01:09:33.123 --> 01:09:39.623]   but using this great reset to really take up their whole idea of control and authoritarianism.
[01:09:39.850 --> 01:09:49.092]  They have decided to trigger a controlled collapse and then bring in a new dark age to control the general public where they will be in their Elysium fields.
[01:09:49.372 --> 01:09:51.613]  There is no new technology coming in.
[01:09:51.633 --> 01:09:52.453]  They're blocking that.
[01:09:53.073 --> 01:09:59.094]  And so really they're just imploding things under the cloud pivot model to show that they can get that control over us.
[01:09:59.455 --> 01:10:01.395]  Alex Jones cuts to the heart of the matter.
[01:10:01.475 --> 01:10:14.318]  He has presented tons of valid evidence and facts that I think have been really, really important to raising consciousness to what this sort of technocratic global elite really want to do.
[01:10:14.798 --> 01:10:23.804]   The true thing that you've done, which is stunning, If you look at the evidence of that and the facts, you are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:10:24.404 --> 01:10:25.265]  That is very rare.
[01:10:25.325 --> 01:10:28.948]  You've got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation and see that.
[01:10:29.789 --> 01:10:36.455]  This book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, I'm telling you, everybody in America, the people that hate Alex Jones the most have to read this book.
[01:10:37.016 --> 01:10:37.977]  This is no beach read.
[01:10:38.644 --> 01:10:39.845]  You're not going to be flipping pages here.
[01:10:39.865 --> 01:10:42.147]  You're going to be having a pen out and you're going to be underlying stuff.
[01:10:42.487 --> 01:10:43.067]  It's amazing.
[01:10:43.588 --> 01:10:47.651]  The Great Reset and the War for the World by Alex Jones.
[01:10:48.011 --> 01:10:52.394]  Available now on Amazon or InfowarsStore.com.
[01:10:53.195 --> 01:10:58.259]  And let me show viewers a screenshot we've got right here.
[01:10:58.279 --> 01:11:04.475]   This is In United States history, in world history, and in history
[01:11:04.475 --> 01:11:15.554]   period, it's been number one the last few days ahead of Obama and Michelle Obama.
[01:11:15.554 --> 01:11:18.675]  This is the number one book right now ahead of Obama.
[01:11:18.679 --> 01:11:20.920]  They are so pissed off about this.
[01:11:20.980 --> 01:11:22.801]  It's a vote against their tyranny.
[01:11:22.821 --> 01:11:23.961]  Get it at Amazon.com.
[01:11:24.341 --> 01:11:26.122]  Skyhorse Publishing, the great reset in the world of the world.
[01:11:26.422 --> 01:11:28.543]  Tony Lyons, you are kicking ass here.
[01:11:29.063 --> 01:11:30.164]  I can feel your excitement.
[01:11:30.204 --> 01:11:32.965]  You predicted to me this would happen, and you've backed us.
[01:11:33.045 --> 01:11:33.705]  We appreciate you.
[01:11:33.725 --> 01:11:35.566]  You're a major imprint of a major publisher.
[01:11:35.906 --> 01:11:36.927]  You're in stores everywhere.
[01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:38.788]  This book is so powerful.
[01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:41.511]  This is really gonna get on record what we stand for.
[01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:45.454]  So again, thank you so much for coming to me with this project, saying you're the Great Reset expert.
[01:11:45.754 --> 01:11:46.275]  You should do this.
[01:11:46.315 --> 01:11:46.975]  Please continue.
[01:11:48.436 --> 01:11:49.557]  Let me say one last thing.
[01:11:49.637 --> 01:12:02.989]  So, The Great Reset and The War for the World is the book that the government doesn't want you to read, that most of the big powerful companies trying to control your life, the big tech companies, they don't want you to read this book.
[01:12:03.429 --> 01:12:08.887]   They want to control what you think, what you do, what you read, but you don't want
[01:12:08.887 --> 01:12:11.228]  that and Alex Jones doesn't want that.
[01:12:11.228 --> 01:12:16.429]   And this book shows you what's happening and gives you the sort of playbook for how to
[01:12:16.429 --> 01:12:17.748]  fight against it.
[01:12:17.748 --> 01:12:22.988]   And so by buying this book, you're going to prove that censorship doesn't work, that freedom
[01:12:22.988 --> 01:12:24.849]  is alive in this country.
[01:12:24.849 --> 01:12:26.908]  This is essential reading.
[01:12:26.908 --> 01:12:31.108]   And you know, I would go right now and buy it before the censorship kicks in.
[01:12:31.463 --> 01:12:33.423]  It's not going to be available in bookstores.
[01:12:33.723 --> 01:12:35.804]  It's not going to be available in libraries.
[01:12:36.104 --> 01:12:41.665]  They're going to try to take it down from every platform that they can, but they're not going to be able to do it.
[01:12:41.825 --> 01:12:44.165]  Prove that censorship doesn't work.
[01:12:44.605 --> 01:12:45.665]  Buy The Great Reset.
[01:12:46.045 --> 01:12:47.026]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[01:12:47.066 --> 01:12:52.607]  I really appreciate you having me on, and I appreciate you writing this book and getting the information out there.
[01:12:52.627 --> 01:12:53.807]  I've got a few more questions.
[01:12:53.827 --> 01:13:02.411]   I know you've got to go, but Tony, You predicted it could go to number one this early, a month before it comes out, or a little less than a month.
[01:13:02.752 --> 01:13:12.397]  How big a deal is it right now that it's in the top 50 on the overall global charts and number one in so many areas like media, communications, history, politics, fascism?
[01:13:12.797 --> 01:13:15.519]  I mean, this is ahead of rise and fall of Third Reich right now.
[01:13:17.125 --> 01:13:17.385]  Sure.
[01:13:17.405 --> 01:13:26.333]  I mean, this is going to prove, like I said, that censorship, that globalism, that fascism, that these are things people want to fight against.
[01:13:26.653 --> 01:13:27.654]  People see it now.
[01:13:28.175 --> 01:13:33.840]  You know, maybe for the first time, lots of people are seeing what's going on and they're rebelling against it.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.323]  And they see your book coming out and they're flocking to it.
[01:13:37.543 --> 01:13:46.712]  So it really is an amazing thing that at this point, so early on, it's already number one in so many categories, and it's selling so well.
[01:13:46.732 --> 01:13:55.360]  It's in the top 50 books in the world, and I'm sure that if your viewers go out and buy it, they can send it to number one where it should be.
[01:13:55.921 --> 01:13:57.843]  What do you predict will happen if it hits number one?
[01:13:59.816 --> 01:14:15.664]  I think that it's going to make a lot of people angry and frustrated, and there's going to be a whole series of hit pieces in all kinds of newspapers and magazines, and they're going to go against you, and they're going to go against me, but they're not going to answer any of the allegations in the book.
[01:14:15.704 --> 01:14:17.765]  They're not going to address the issues.
[01:14:18.026 --> 01:14:19.726]  They're just going to try to shut it down.
[01:14:19.766 --> 01:14:26.270]  They're going to use the playbook of ignore the book, ignore the arguments, and just go after the people.
[01:14:26.690 --> 01:14:31.418]  So it's cancel culture, it's censorship, and we have to fight that at all costs.
[01:14:31.678 --> 01:14:32.159]  Well, that's right.
[01:14:32.199 --> 01:14:46.227]   Neil Strauss, four years ago, approached me, one of the top authors in the world, and he said, Look, I got a major publisher, one of the top managers in the world, agents, he said it's gonna happen.
[01:14:46.868 --> 01:14:54.135]  And I was on the phone with Judith Regan and all these other people, and they fired the guy, and CNN got the book proposal, and they shut it down.
[01:14:54.175 --> 01:14:55.897]  He said he never imagined that could happen.
[01:14:56.217 --> 01:15:05.588]   How have you had the position and the history and the courage With all the other deals you've got, what made Tony Lyons of Skyhorse Publishing decide to really take this bold move?
[01:15:05.608 --> 01:15:08.091]  Because this is the boldest move could be taken in publishing.
[01:15:08.311 --> 01:15:09.432]  That's not hype, that's true.
[01:15:11.074 --> 01:15:21.882]   Yeah, so my general feeling is that I'm more afraid of not Publishing books that are important, that are controversial, that make people think.
[01:15:22.222 --> 01:15:27.925]  You know, where people look at this title and they think, I'm going to disagree with all of this.
[01:15:27.965 --> 01:15:30.586]  Well, that's a really good reason to buy a book.
[01:15:30.867 --> 01:15:33.128]  That's a good reason to buy The Great Reset.
[01:15:33.428 --> 01:15:36.550]  Even if you're sure you're going to disagree with all of it, read it.
[01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:37.570]  Think about it.
[01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:40.352]  That's what happens in a democratic country.
[01:15:40.792 --> 01:15:44.557]  You know, this is not a country that was built on censorship.
[01:15:44.857 --> 01:15:49.342]  And, you know, the future of this country can't be shutting things down.
[01:15:49.402 --> 01:15:58.633]  So I'm more afraid of shutting things down than I am of any consequences that can come to me from publishing good, solid books.
[01:15:59.213 --> 01:16:04.395]  They have important arguments in them that, you know, people, like I said, they can disagree.
[01:16:04.855 --> 01:16:07.076]  But that's what's supposed to happen in this country.
[01:16:07.416 --> 01:16:10.777]  People can disagree, but they can't just shut things down.
[01:16:11.117 --> 01:16:12.818]  They can't just stifle dissent.
[01:16:13.158 --> 01:16:14.758]  They can't stifle ideas.
[01:16:15.118 --> 01:16:17.159]  And we have to stop them from doing that.
[01:16:17.439 --> 01:16:18.860]  And that's what we're trying to do.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.140]  Gut level.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.781]  This could be the new 1984, but a nonfiction.
[01:16:23.821 --> 01:16:25.982]  I mean, I think it's got that potential.
[01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.543]  And how are you gut level feeling?
[01:16:30.373 --> 01:16:34.342]  I think that this book could be the number one book in the next month.
[01:16:34.883 --> 01:16:39.092]  And if that happens, like I said, it's going to make a lot of people angry.
[01:16:39.716 --> 01:16:49.843]  But, you know, that's the thing, is that people are saying now, so many people, you can read this in the New York Times all the time, that you're not supposed to give a platform to people who you disagree with.
[01:16:50.143 --> 01:16:51.644]  But, you know, what is journalism?
[01:16:51.684 --> 01:17:02.892]  I mean, journalism, writers in general, they're supposed to write things that are complicated, that are new, that are interesting, that challenge the beliefs of the people reading them.
[01:17:03.232 --> 01:17:07.214]  So why would you want to only buy books where you know what's going to be in there?
[01:17:07.254 --> 01:17:08.475]  You agree with all of that.
[01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:16.416]  job.
[01:17:16.416 --> 01:17:21.815]   So they're pushing digital IDs again and here's Tony Blair the former Prime
[01:17:21.815 --> 01:17:23.056]  Minister of UK.
[01:17:23.056 --> 01:17:23.895]  Okay.
[01:17:24.622 --> 01:17:27.163]  Are you the Prime Minister of UK or the Prime Minister of England?
[01:17:27.823 --> 01:17:28.263]  I don't know.
[01:17:28.283 --> 01:17:28.903]  OK, I thought.
[01:17:29.323 --> 01:17:30.444]  It's got to be the UK, right?
[01:17:31.904 --> 01:17:32.005]  OK.
[01:17:34.139 --> 01:17:39.290]  The Telegraph, Tony Blair launches new drive for digital ID cards to tackle illegal immigration.
[01:17:40.572 --> 01:17:41.595]  Why is this interesting?
[01:17:42.336 --> 01:17:44.461]  Because he keeps changing the reason why we need it.
[01:17:45.993 --> 01:17:50.936]  Whatever is going on in the moment in the culture is the reason why we need it.
[01:17:51.496 --> 01:17:52.016]  We want to see?
[01:17:52.156 --> 01:17:53.517]  So he's saying this now.
[01:17:54.017 --> 01:17:59.320]  Tony Blair has launched a new drive for ID cards as he claims it would tackle illegal immigration.
[01:18:00.181 --> 01:18:12.536]   A report by the former Prime Minister's Institute published on Friday said the weakest link in the government's approach to migration was its failure to crack down on a black market filled by unscrupulous employers giving jobs to illegal
[01:18:12.536 --> 01:18:13.445]  migrants.
[01:18:13.445 --> 01:18:17.266]   So he knows that's a hot button issue, so he's going to now try to push that button
[01:18:17.266 --> 01:18:22.586]   in you to get you to go along with ID cards because if you think it's going to hurt illegal
[01:18:22.586 --> 01:18:24.746]  immigrants, you'll be for it.
[01:18:24.746 --> 01:18:32.346]   Why did he, I mean, since when is he against illegal immigrants, the biggest neoliberal,
[01:18:32.346 --> 01:18:33.625]  when would he be against that?
[01:18:33.646 --> 01:18:34.927]  That's so suspicious.
[01:18:35.027 --> 01:18:38.268]  Isn't he a big global market, lower the wages for everyone guy?
[01:18:38.488 --> 01:18:40.830]  He's certainly a neoliberal.
[01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:46.052]  Here's what he said about, here's the old reason he used to give about why we need digital IDs.
[01:18:46.072 --> 01:18:56.336]   You can create a digital ID today that is Much more easily protected so you can deal with a lot of the privacy and surveillance issues that worry people.
[01:18:56.757 --> 01:19:02.941]  But it's a natural evolution of the way that we're going to use technology in any event.
[01:19:03.522 --> 01:19:06.344]  It's a natural, it's just, this is just natural.
[01:19:06.944 --> 01:19:09.446]  This is how nature intended things to be.
[01:19:09.466 --> 01:19:11.688]  Nature works this way.
[01:19:11.708 --> 01:19:11.828]  Nature.
[01:19:11.888 --> 01:19:13.009]  Nature invented this app.
[01:19:17.259 --> 01:19:17.679]  Here we go.
[01:19:17.699 --> 01:19:19.920]  Look, if a tree falls in the woods, is there a sound?
[01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.941]  Of course, because someone is always listening and watching.
[01:19:24.501 --> 01:19:27.662]  Use technology, in any event, to transact daily life.
[01:19:28.082 --> 01:19:32.703]  And this COVID crisis gives an additional reason for doing that, because... So it's because of COVID!
[01:19:35.584 --> 01:19:40.145]  They said COVID would bring in the World ID and the carbon tax, we told you 32 months ago.
[01:19:40.165 --> 01:19:43.346]  And it all happened just like we told you, because we know who the enemy is.
[01:19:44.943 --> 01:19:45.804]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:19:46.404 --> 01:19:50.707]  Owen Schroyer is set to take over from 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:19:50.747 --> 01:19:54.830]  with Sunday Live, which is a very powerful Sunday broadcast we do.
[01:19:54.850 --> 01:19:56.471]  We've cut out all the network ads.
[01:19:57.349 --> 01:19:58.449]  For radio and TV stations.
[01:19:58.469 --> 01:20:02.050]  We only have six minutes of ads an hour for our local affiliates.
[01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:04.470]  That's really the model we're going to go to soon.
[01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:05.971]  Closer to podcasts.
[01:20:05.991 --> 01:20:09.791]  We're still on 400 plus radio stations and TV stations and cable stations.
[01:20:09.831 --> 01:20:11.772]  They have on average 14 minutes of ads an hour.
[01:20:12.252 --> 01:20:20.573]  But if we simply take our seven minutes of ads hour or so, you have six minutes of ads during the main show and I guess a minute at the end of the hour.
[01:20:20.633 --> 01:20:22.934]  So Owen is going to take over.
[01:20:23.014 --> 01:20:44.566]   But at the beginning of it, We're going to air a very powerful program out of the UK, out of Scotland particularly, where Emile Oliver in nine and a half minutes absolutely does the best job in a very short clip that I've seen of succinctly describing the anti-human Great Reset.
[01:20:45.867 --> 01:20:58.285]   So we see leaders in Russia, leaders in South Africa, leaders in Brazil, leaders in Mexico, leaders in the US, leaders all over the world Nailing it and exposing what's happening.
[01:20:58.325 --> 01:21:06.755]  So if your local station doesn't carry Sunday Live, they should, but everybody should tune in to Infowars.com forward slash show and man dot video when no one takes over.
[01:21:06.775 --> 01:21:13.523]  But we're going to air at the start of the next hour this report that needs to go viral.
[01:21:14.406 --> 01:21:16.327]  I saw it on Twitter a week ago with like 500 views.
[01:21:16.447 --> 01:21:22.208]  I know it was on UK television and reached millions, but I'm like, wow, this needs 10 million views.
[01:21:22.228 --> 01:21:26.069]  Because this guy's like Alex Jones without the caffeine.
[01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:35.382]   And Alex Jones with caffeine is a great thing, but it's good to have this classic Scott I mean, he just looks like the archetypal badass Scott.
[01:21:36.303 --> 01:21:39.524]  Up there laying it out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:39.965 --> 01:21:42.246]  This is the leadership we need.
[01:21:42.686 --> 01:21:46.768]  And that just makes me sleep at night knowing there's folks like Neil Oliver out there.
[01:21:47.248 --> 01:21:54.152]  So, that is coming up, start of Sunday Live with Owen Schroyer here in just a few minutes.
[01:21:54.312 --> 01:21:54.572]  Okay.
[01:21:56.305 --> 01:21:56.665]  The U.N.
[01:21:56.685 --> 01:21:59.867]  announced World IDs last year, but they've officially rolled it out now.
[01:21:59.887 --> 01:22:01.488]  We played that last hour.
[01:22:02.009 --> 01:22:03.930]  Then we've got this article on Infowars.com.
[01:22:04.010 --> 01:22:07.932]  Biden administration giving social security numbers to illegal aliens at the U.S.
[01:22:07.992 --> 01:22:08.292]  border.
[01:22:08.833 --> 01:22:10.794]  Laura Logan learns with the documents.
[01:22:11.434 --> 01:22:15.257]  Absolutely incredible report showing how this all works.
[01:22:15.277 --> 01:22:16.457]  It's not about stopping illegals.
[01:22:16.477 --> 01:22:17.398]  It's about controlling you.
[01:22:17.818 --> 01:22:18.379]  And then this.
[01:22:19.099 --> 01:22:23.142]  San Francisco Kink and Fetish Fest, where they urinate and eat poop.
[01:22:23.482 --> 01:22:24.642]  Folks, I can't show these clips.
[01:22:24.703 --> 01:22:25.143]  We have them.
[01:22:26.226 --> 01:22:27.569]  And have sex in the street.
[01:22:27.990 --> 01:22:31.418]  They parade children through the streets while they're having sex with children.
[01:22:31.799 --> 01:22:33.482]  This is pedophile extravaganza.
[01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:54.356]  San Francisco Kink and Fetish Festival to press on despite Monkeypox emergency declaration and despite the fact that 99% of Monkeypox cases that finally had one death in Europe, we got a whole new lockdown because of it, but they're not gonna stop having up to 50 sexual partners a week.
[01:22:54.696 --> 01:22:58.278]  I don't care if you're heterosexual or you're homosexual, leave kids alone.
[01:22:58.818 --> 01:23:07.047]   And I don't care if you're heterosexual or homosexual, You can't have dozens of partners a week and not have your Johnson fall off.
[01:23:08.349 --> 01:23:22.063]  And so, that's what's going on here, folks, is total mental illness, complete out-of-control behavior, and these people want your children because nothing else gets them excited anymore.
[01:23:23.672 --> 01:23:29.034]  As monkeypox spreads, health experts urge Texas universities to prepare for outbreaks.
[01:23:29.875 --> 01:23:32.376]  And then even Fox News says, well, don't attack gay people.
[01:23:32.636 --> 01:23:37.358]  We're not attacking anybody except anyone who's having sex with dozens of people a week.
[01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:39.379]  And then you want to lock us down.
[01:23:39.439 --> 01:23:43.681]  You don't see them at the pedo parades wearing their frickin' mask.
[01:23:44.041 --> 01:23:49.383]  They do it as a sign of their political party at the airport or your school or city council to suppress you.
[01:23:49.823 --> 01:23:50.744]  In fact, we have this clip.
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:55.621]  This is a clip that's absolutely disgusting.
[01:23:56.562 --> 01:23:58.222]  And this deals with all of this.
[01:23:58.622 --> 01:24:02.264]  This is the churches all over the Western world captured by these people.
[01:24:03.084 --> 01:24:05.025]  And this is right here in the USA.
[01:24:06.626 --> 01:24:09.427]  Well, this is in New York of a captured church.
[01:24:10.481 --> 01:24:22.212]  With a bunch of LGBT supporters wearing masks and rainbow hats, while a giant fat man that looks scarier than It the Clown, or Chucky, marching down.
[01:24:22.292 --> 01:24:23.993]  So this is blasphemy.
[01:24:24.574 --> 01:24:30.499]   This is what the Satanists always do of Going into filing churches, this is 101.
[01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:34.042]  That a woman is a 400 pound man.
[01:24:34.462 --> 01:24:41.869]  That a woman is a man in a clown outfit with a bunch of children in a church celebrating their victory over humanity.
[01:24:42.089 --> 01:24:42.730]  Here's the report.
[01:24:44.451 --> 01:24:50.230]  Her name is Britta Filter, and she is the Queen of New York!
[01:24:50.230 --> 01:24:56.730]  [Cheering]
[01:24:56.730 --> 01:24:58.730]  This is what your churches are now.
[01:24:59.010 --> 01:25:01.091]  Imagine people that built that church hundreds of years ago.
[01:25:02.692 --> 01:25:03.693]  Everything they had to build it.
[01:25:04.293 --> 01:25:06.294]  Had their names on the pews and now this is happening.
[01:25:08.315 --> 01:25:15.315]   That's nothing compared to them wanting access to our children.
[01:25:15.315 --> 01:25:25.854]   Marking Thank you.
[01:25:26.172 --> 01:25:42.775]  They're territory over our children, over our lives, over who we are, and trying to take our guns so we can't protect ourselves and make us take experimental injections into our bodies.
[01:25:43.436 --> 01:25:45.436]  Look at this report right here.
[01:25:45.436 --> 01:25:53.035]  This meme says it all.
[01:25:52.337 --> 01:25:54.118]  It's already illicit, I'll describe it.
[01:25:54.138 --> 01:25:55.158]  It's from Elijah Schaffer.
[01:25:56.684 --> 01:25:57.644]  Ghostguns.com.
[01:25:58.565 --> 01:26:02.686]  One good guy with a gun is worth more than 376 cops who did nothing.
[01:26:03.126 --> 01:26:08.068]  It's actually over 450 now, and you've all day that stood down while the children were killed.
[01:26:08.108 --> 01:26:15.191]  But these two men stopped mass shooters dead in their tracks before they could kill masses of people.
[01:26:17.112 --> 01:26:19.012]  That is the reality.
[01:26:19.312 --> 01:26:21.153]  The House has passed the assault weapons ban.
[01:26:23.714 --> 01:26:25.535]  The move to take our guns is admitted.
[01:26:26.778 --> 01:26:28.339]  It's all out in the open now.
[01:26:28.959 --> 01:26:33.582]  All right, Owen Schroyer takes over with this key report by Neil Oliver.
[01:26:35.263 --> 01:26:37.244]  At the start of the hour, I hope this goes viral.
[01:26:37.264 --> 01:26:38.025]  It needs to go viral.
[01:26:38.625 --> 01:26:41.146]  We're going to take this show today that was really, I think, informative.
[01:26:41.166 --> 01:26:42.707]  We're going to cut it up to five or six clips.
[01:26:43.127 --> 01:26:44.528]  We'll post those at man.video.
[01:26:44.568 --> 01:26:48.330]  And that's your arsenal of truth to fight the globalists.
[01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:50.852]  They wouldn't be censoring if the truth wasn't hurting them.
[01:26:51.826 --> 01:26:53.708]  So please spread the word about the articles and videos.
[01:26:54.028 --> 01:26:55.009]  Please pray for InfoWars.
[01:26:55.089 --> 01:26:59.273]  And please, we're in bankruptcy, but we have a plan to come out of it and stay on air.
[01:27:00.134 --> 01:27:09.083]  If you'll go to InfoWarsStore.com and get your turmeric, your bodies, get your vitamin refusion, get your diet force, get your books, get your films, get your t-shirts.
[01:27:09.163 --> 01:27:09.864]  Alex Jones is right.
[01:27:10.264 --> 01:27:12.226]  We have a plan to win and stay on air.
[01:27:12.266 --> 01:27:13.247]  They're so pissed off.
[01:27:13.568 --> 01:27:15.470]  Their plan is to shut us down, but if you'll just go.
[01:27:16.210 --> 01:27:19.472]  Infowarstore.com and buy the products right now.
[01:27:19.852 --> 01:27:20.672]  We are unstoppable.
[01:27:20.912 --> 01:27:21.973]  But I'm in your hands.
