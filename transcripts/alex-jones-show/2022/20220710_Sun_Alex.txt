[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.359]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.359 --> 00:00:11.039]   This equation has four factors, a little bit of multiplication.
[00:00:10.347 --> 00:00:13.351]  So you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero.
[00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:20.929]   And that's going to be based on the number of people, the services each person's using on average,
[00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:28.131]   the energy on average for each service, and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.
[00:00:28.131 --> 00:00:33.451]   So let's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero.
[00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:37.650]   Probably one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
[00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.131]  That's fact from high school algebra.
[00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:42.290]  But let's take a look.
[00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.771]  First we've got population.
[00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.811]  The world today has 6.8 billion people.
[00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:48.911]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[00:00:49.512 --> 00:00:57.855]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:07.964]  Many believed that Bill Gates somehow misspoke when he attributed successful depopulation to the vaccines.
[00:01:08.624 --> 00:01:10.426]  But it's now evident that he didn't.
[00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:15.030]  He was being very clear about the intentions of the globalist agenda.
[00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.792]  Kill 99.99% of all humans.
[00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:25.500]  According to these psychopaths, this is how we will save the planet.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.945]  And they have convinced an overwhelming amount of the world's population into accepting their agenda and pushing for it.
[00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:41.492]  People who believe that humans need to be aborted and believe the human race needs to be culled into a small compliant herd.
[00:01:41.972 --> 00:01:49.838]  People that are okay with billions of people starving, so long as the screens on their devices tell them it's the right thing to do.
[00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.661]  But not everyone has gone insane.
[00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:57.223]  Some still have a survival instinct.
[00:01:57.923 --> 00:02:16.035]  When the Dutch government voted in a scheme that will force farmers to cut their livestock down to unsustainable levels, thereby forcing them out of work and shutting down the second biggest food exporter in the world, the farmers did the right thing and said no.
[00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:20.358]  And protests have broken out all throughout the Netherlands.
[00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:29.005]  Shutting down the world's second biggest food exporter is all part of the anti-human zero emissions plan.
[00:02:29.706 --> 00:02:38.033]  And so the Dutch farmers aren't just protesting losing their jobs, they're protesting the mass murder of the world's population.
[00:02:39.602 --> 00:02:43.285]  Just like the Canadian truckers and farmers did last winter.
[00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:49.771]  And just like the Canadian police sided with the tyrants, the Dutch cops are doing the same.
[00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:56.857]  Police drawing their sidearms on peaceful protesters and opening fire on them.
[00:02:56.877 --> 00:03:09.890]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, using undercover agents and provoking violence to shut down
[00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:23.721]  peaceful gatherings.
[00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:28.200]  Because the globalists are not taking no for an answer.
[00:03:28.376 --> 00:03:42.509]  And while you may back the blue, chances are that they won't back you when it comes to the globalist agenda, which has now enlisted A-list celebrities to convince us all to eat bugs.
[00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:47.774]  I'm Nicole Kidman, and I am going to eat a four-course meal of bugs.
[00:03:48.374 --> 00:03:54.038]  They're trying to persuade us into dying peacefully, like good, obedient slaves.
[00:03:54.958 --> 00:03:57.480]  But soon, the food will start to run out.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:07.987]  And worse, more signs of kinetic world war on the horizon, as Japan's longest-standing Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, is assassinated.
[00:04:08.687 --> 00:04:19.257]  And former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev joins President Putin in threatening nuclear annihilation if the United States continues their provocations.
[00:04:19.937 --> 00:04:22.760]  Which is exactly what the Extinction Rebellion wants.
[00:04:23.581 --> 00:04:25.742]  And it's what the Biden administration wants.
[00:04:26.623 --> 00:04:28.484]  It's what everyone in charge wants.
[00:04:29.245 --> 00:04:33.548]  The only way out of this is a worldwide people's revolution.
[00:04:33.948 --> 00:04:38.871]  The Dutch farmers have begun, and they have been joined by people from other nations.
[00:04:39.531 --> 00:04:42.193]  The revolution will not be televised.
[00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:46.656]  And if you want to stand up against evil, then now is the time.
[00:04:47.356 --> 00:04:48.937]  While you are still alive.
[00:04:50.378 --> 00:04:52.660]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:55.298]  It's Sunday Live.
[00:04:55.318 --> 00:04:55.838]  Stay with us.
[00:04:55.658 --> 00:04:57.658]  this will be back in 60 seconds.
[00:04:57.658 --> 00:05:00.238]  (upbeat music)
[00:05:00.238 --> 00:05:02.819]  (upbeat music)
[00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:09.077]  Sunday, July 10th, 2022.
[00:05:09.077 --> 00:05:12.278]  The Great Reset is here.
[00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:16.759]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:23.079]  (upbeat music)
[00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:24.497]  Yeah, baby, yeah!
[00:05:25.113 --> 00:05:27.294]  India.
[00:05:27.334 --> 00:05:28.574]  The Netherlands.
[00:05:28.694 --> 00:05:28.994]  Albania.
[00:05:28.874 --> 00:05:58.854]   Sri Lanka, India, the Netherlands, Albania, the US, the UK, South Africa, and countries
[00:05:58.854 --> 00:06:00.854]  in Latin America.
[00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:04.970]  Over a hundred nations having massive riots, government buildings being stormed.
[00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.953]  Sunday live, the global collapse that we have predicted is here.
[00:06:09.973 --> 00:06:14.596]  It is the organized Great Reset being carried out by design.
[00:06:14.616 --> 00:06:16.037]  We're going to lay out what comes next.
[00:06:17.873 --> 00:06:37.981]  Now a lot of people, including a lot of nationalists and populists and conservatives, are celebrating the riots and takeover of government buildings around the world, and they're saying, look, the people are awake, they're angry, they're going after these corrupt systems, they know what's going on.
[00:06:39.602 --> 00:06:40.563]  This is an equation.
[00:06:40.623 --> 00:06:44.066]  This is political math, basically, is what it boils down to.
[00:06:44.986 --> 00:06:52.072]  Yes, the public's angry, because they've been under two and a half years in many areas of the world of lockdown that destroyed the economy and the supply chain.
[00:06:53.033 --> 00:06:58.277]  And yes, many of these governments have been clients of the globalists, and so they are bad people.
[00:07:00.859 --> 00:07:26.893]   But if you go back to the IMF and World Bank documents that Greg Palastcott In 2002 that we covered ad nauseum, they said that in the next 20 years they would implement the same formulas they had used in third world countries to collapse them by design in Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
[00:07:28.379 --> 00:07:31.780]  And so people ask why I've been harping on the coming collapse.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:41.563]  Well, that's because the globalists have said they would do it, not just in those documents, but in thousands of other statements and documents we've covered here.
[00:07:41.603 --> 00:07:44.304]  So it wasn't like I was predicting this.
[00:07:44.684 --> 00:07:46.324]  I knew they were going to try to do it.
[00:07:46.604 --> 00:07:51.506]  And so we were trying to expose them and stop them from getting to this point.
[00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:54.266]  We weren't just trying to predict it to be proven right.
[00:07:54.606 --> 00:07:56.287]  We were trying to stop it.
[00:07:58.689 --> 00:08:01.751]  So, are they bad to storm government buildings in Sri Lanka?
[00:08:01.891 --> 00:08:02.111]  No.
[00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:04.692]  Are they bad to storm government buildings in India?
[00:08:04.872 --> 00:08:05.092]  No.
[00:08:05.693 --> 00:08:11.876]  Are they bad to surround police stations in the airports in the Netherlands and block all the major roads in the country?
[00:08:11.976 --> 00:08:12.176]  No.
[00:08:14.637 --> 00:08:16.058]  Are they wrong in Albania?
[00:08:16.918 --> 00:08:17.539]  Do the same thing?
[00:08:17.579 --> 00:08:17.779]  No.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:27.404]  But the corporate media is spinning it like they're just mad at their governments, and this is going to cause a worldwide collapse.
[00:08:28.703 --> 00:08:30.414]  No, the lockdowns of the last 30.
[00:08:34.181 --> 00:08:52.434]  Months is what was on record to destroy the supply chain and destroy food supplies and energy supplies, and then mathematically they know that when you're spending more than 50% on food and energy, you will have a violent revolution.
[00:08:52.955 --> 00:08:53.955]  It's guaranteed.
[00:08:54.276 --> 00:08:55.617]  Black people act the same.
[00:08:56.117 --> 00:08:57.478]  Brown people act the same.
[00:08:57.878 --> 00:08:59.119]  White people act the same.
[00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:03.139]  the end of the day folks we're the same.
[00:09:03.139 --> 00:09:09.938]   And that's why Klaus Schwab talks about an angrier world and how we're going
[00:09:10.761 --> 00:09:29.225]  And that's why Bill Gates, and Joe Biden, and Bill Clinton, and Angela Merkel, and Macron, and Johnson, and all of them say, Trudeau, all of them say, we're cutting off the energy and the food to bring in the new system.
[00:09:29.685 --> 00:09:31.725]  But there is no new system we're even bringing in.
[00:09:33.346 --> 00:09:38.443]   So I've been sitting here looking at my watch, Hoping we could stop it.
[00:09:40.464 --> 00:09:41.264]  Knowing it was coming.
[00:09:42.324 --> 00:09:43.404]  Not knowing exactly when.
[00:09:43.965 --> 00:09:45.325]  But these are the big central banks.
[00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:47.866]  These are the people who took over the world by fiat currency.
[00:09:48.226 --> 00:09:56.968]  These are the folks that run the eugenics systems, and the depopulation operations, and the drag queen pedophile time, and the devalued currencies, the open borders, and the whole thing.
[00:10:00.549 --> 00:10:05.790]  And so, we've been sitting here battling their agenda, warning people they'll ban your cows.
[00:10:06.789 --> 00:10:11.850]  Which holds up and is the only profit in most farms in the world, and now they're banning those in Europe.
[00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:13.191]  And now it's coming here.
[00:10:13.551 --> 00:10:19.592]  Bill Gates doesn't get up and say, we're going to ban beef, we're going to make you eat bugs, because he's pulling that out of his rear end.
[00:10:20.032 --> 00:10:20.992]  They mean that.
[00:10:21.813 --> 00:10:23.253]  And folks are going to figure that out.
[00:10:23.573 --> 00:10:29.274]  That we're not up here imagining fantastical stuff, and then it just comes true.
[00:10:29.675 --> 00:10:34.276]  A very popular thing I see everywhere is Alex Jones gives them ideas.
[00:10:34.356 --> 00:10:35.416]  Boy, I wish that was the case.
[00:10:36.357 --> 00:11:00.698]  No, I am reading their battle plan for a controlled worldwide economic demolition that will starve the third world to death, who survives will flood us, bring us down, mass war, famine, collapse, and then out of it a worldwide authoritarian government to stabilize the planet with a planetary currency, carbon taxes, universal credit score, built on the back of the vaccine passport.
[00:11:02.748 --> 00:11:04.609]  And all of it's been announced, and all of it's here.
[00:11:04.709 --> 00:11:07.389]  So, my job is about to get a lot easier.
[00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.330]  I'm not here telling you what I'm trying to stop anymore.
[00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:14.331]  Baby, baby, baby.
[00:11:15.031 --> 00:11:16.052]  We're in it now.
[00:11:18.472 --> 00:11:22.914]  The only question is, how far do you want this to go?
[00:11:26.255 --> 00:11:30.316]  How bad do you want it to get until you identify the new world order?
[00:11:30.336 --> 00:11:31.136]  Let me give you the good news.
[00:11:32.762 --> 00:11:41.184]  In Australia, in New Zealand, in Albania, in Sri Lanka, and in the Netherlands particularly, and the UK.
[00:11:44.265 --> 00:11:46.465]  You go read the signs, we've translated them.
[00:11:48.025 --> 00:11:54.487]  In the Dutch, in the German, in the French, in the Sri Lankan, all of it.
[00:11:56.181 --> 00:12:00.604]  They are saying, we want the central banks, we want Klaus Schwab, we want Bill Gates.
[00:12:01.064 --> 00:12:02.746]  We don't want our governments to be run by them.
[00:12:02.786 --> 00:12:04.086]  We know you cut the fuel off.
[00:12:04.387 --> 00:12:05.627]  We know you cut the food off.
[00:12:05.928 --> 00:12:07.589]  We know you did the lockdowns to do this.
[00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:08.710]  We're gonna kill you.
[00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:10.731]  That's what they're saying.
[00:12:14.568 --> 00:12:17.190]  So let me give the New World Order a little announcement here.
[00:12:17.831 --> 00:12:22.315]  Because I don't just tell the general public what's coming next, I tell the enemy and they know it's true.
[00:12:22.335 --> 00:12:24.316]  Because I don't say something unless I believe it.
[00:12:24.817 --> 00:12:30.602]  You screwed up big time, you doubled down, and now you're in deep trouble.
[00:12:31.122 --> 00:12:38.984]  Maybe not this year, maybe not five years, but in the end, you will all be in prison for the rest of your lives, if you're lucky, when this is all over.
[00:12:39.264 --> 00:12:44.225]  You're not going to have your robot take over, your great reset's going to fail, your agenda 2030's not going to work.
[00:12:44.365 --> 00:12:59.888]  People know you're doing it, and they know who you are, and there's seven and a half billion of us, and we know when you release the next bioweapon that's ten times more deadly than you did it, and there won't be anywhere on earth that's safe for you and your Georgia Guidestones.
[00:13:01.869 --> 00:13:04.971]  So, I'm here to thank God for this.
[00:13:05.972 --> 00:13:07.873]  As bad as things are, at least we're in a fighting stance.
[00:13:07.893 --> 00:13:08.674]  At least we know what's going on.
[00:13:09.354 --> 00:13:11.115]  Warmer people know, and it's a chain reaction.
[00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:11.836]  We're winning.
[00:13:13.497 --> 00:13:14.978]  But I want to thank God, number one.
[00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:21.102]  I want to thank the crew and the audience of activists.
[00:13:22.762 --> 00:13:25.124]  And my family and those that have supported us.
[00:13:25.485 --> 00:13:27.186]  And I want to make this announcement not as a boast.
[00:13:27.226 --> 00:13:28.707]  We're under attack because the enemy knows it's true.
[00:13:29.088 --> 00:13:29.748]  But I want to say this.
[00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:32.791]  This operation blew the New World Order down the road.
[00:13:33.512 --> 00:13:35.293]  It's like Force 10 from Navarone.
[00:13:35.313 --> 00:13:36.635]  They plant the bombs on the dam.
[00:13:37.195 --> 00:13:38.456]  They explode and they go, it failed.
[00:13:38.857 --> 00:13:41.899]  And the demolition expert goes, give it a couple minutes.
[00:13:44.346 --> 00:13:45.627]  Give it a couple minutes.
[00:13:46.487 --> 00:13:47.607]  You think you blew us?
[00:13:48.268 --> 00:13:50.008]  You think you took down our civilization?
[00:13:50.068 --> 00:13:51.369]  You just destroyed yourselves.
[00:13:51.689 --> 00:13:52.670]  You psycho demons.
[00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:58.552]  Led around by your nose by Satan, thinking you were about to inherit the earth and pull this off.
[00:14:00.453 --> 00:14:02.314]  80% of my mission is now complete.
[00:14:03.294 --> 00:14:04.695]  I will complete the rest of the 20%.
[00:14:04.915 --> 00:14:07.736]  And if I'm still around after that, that's all gravy.
[00:14:07.996 --> 00:14:08.996]  But it's all in God's hands.
[00:14:09.637 --> 00:14:10.797]  I just want to complete the mission.
[00:14:11.157 --> 00:14:12.298]  And I want the crew to understand that.
[00:14:13.186 --> 00:14:15.188]  But I have done the numbers on the U.S.
[00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:20.813]  economy and the world economy, and I will tell you, barring a miracle, we won't be on the air in one year.
[00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:23.336]  These Democrat lawsuits don't matter.
[00:14:23.756 --> 00:14:24.617]  None of this stuff matters.
[00:14:24.657 --> 00:14:25.398]  Folks, let me explain something.
[00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:28.341]  It's going down.
[00:14:29.682 --> 00:14:35.408]  So get ready with your family and prepare yourselves, because civilization as you know it is over.
[00:14:35.868 --> 00:14:43.800]   But at the end of this, The globalists and their master that have launched this attack will be in chains!
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:52.805]  And the new civilization, not their Build Back Better, but God's civilization, will be built on their ashes, not ours!
[00:14:53.004 --> 00:14:54.004]  Stay with us!
[00:14:54.004 --> 00:14:56.004]  [Music]
[00:14:56.004 --> 00:15:06.004]  [Music]
[00:15:06.004 --> 00:15:11.004]   I have stated this point probably 5,000 times in the last 20 years.
[00:15:11.767 --> 00:15:14.789]  I've been on air 28, but things really came into focus 20 years ago.
[00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:22.334]  As evidenced by the thousands of clubs out there making the rounds of the internet before we predicted all of this from the enemy's own documents.
[00:15:23.335 --> 00:15:25.317]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show Sunday edition.
[00:15:27.018 --> 00:15:28.139]  I'm gonna put it to you this way.
[00:15:30.063 --> 00:16:01.318]   We have all the globalist battle plans, we have all their operational manuals, we know their system up one side and down the other, and they wanted to have a worldwide collapse, where you believe, oh, viruses came out of a jungle, global warming is your fault, oh, all this chemtrailing, oh no, that's humans causing all the bad weather, well yeah, humans with geoengineering, and oh, the collapse of the border and the currency, that's all by accident, we didn't know Printing quadrillions in currency would do this.
[00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:10.264]  They wanted a worldwide collapse, where the big mega-corporations could collapse all the governments, blame the governments.
[00:16:10.505 --> 00:16:12.746]  They've said this at the Davos Group on television!
[00:16:14.908 --> 00:16:21.472]  And then have the people all destroy their governments, bring down the civilization, and then have the New World Order roll in as the saviors.
[00:16:23.654 --> 00:16:35.892]   But if they're exposed for how they orchestrated it, and now everybody knows, They have to block the comments on Instagram and Twitter and Facebook and everywhere on the DeVos Group.
[00:16:36.532 --> 00:16:37.313]  And for Pfizer.
[00:16:37.834 --> 00:16:38.975]  And for Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:16:39.355 --> 00:16:49.585]  Because you'll have 10,000 comments to one, literally, quoting them, talking about how people know they're the enemy, how they're depopulationist, how they planned it all.
[00:16:50.586 --> 00:16:53.309]  They'll never put the genie back in the bottle.
[00:16:54.727 --> 00:17:06.037]  Unless they have a huge nuclear war and all the power's off for years and billions of us die right away and then they think they can reorganize because their emergency governmental systems are still in place.
[00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:16.087]  But the bureaucracy and the police and the social contract that serves the people with its problems is being dismantled in front of us.
[00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:20.654]   A controlled Demolition.
[00:17:21.435 --> 00:17:25.257]  And so we're not in beta of the Great Reset, the New World Order.
[00:17:25.537 --> 00:17:27.458]  We're not in Agenda 21 anymore.
[00:17:27.718 --> 00:17:33.841]  That was just the setup of this when they launched it officially with the treaty in the UN in 1992 at Rio de Janeiro.
[00:17:34.822 --> 00:17:37.223]  We are now in operations.
[00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:42.346]  And it's not going well for the New World Order, but they don't care.
[00:17:42.806 --> 00:17:49.350]  Just like Hitler getting his ass kicked two years into World War II, doubled down and invaded Russia.
[00:17:51.223 --> 00:17:53.104]  And the New World Order's done the same thing here.
[00:17:55.186 --> 00:18:07.135]  They've doubled down, and they've got anthropologists and sociologists in every country using cultural data and information to turn the people against each other so we fight with each other.
[00:18:08.596 --> 00:18:22.247]   And that may get a certain percentage of the population to be rabbit-trailed off But it's not affecting a large minority of people of every race, color, and creed that understand what's happening.
[00:18:22.567 --> 00:18:37.597]  And so if the blame for the global meltdown goes to Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and the Rothschilds and the Carnegie Endowment and the Rockefeller Endowment and the whole neoliberal world, it's over for them.
[00:18:40.359 --> 00:18:41.640]  It's still gonna be rough.
[00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:45.451]  It's still gonna be bad.
[00:18:46.632 --> 00:18:51.817]  But under their plan, the collapse goes on forever and ever until at least 80% of us are dead.
[00:18:52.738 --> 00:18:54.560]  Most of their actuaries show 90 plus percent.
[00:18:56.081 --> 00:19:10.348]   And so the only chance we've got, the only card we've got to play, which by the way is total victory, is to expose these people like our lives depend on it, because they do, And to tell everybody what's coming next so they know.
[00:19:10.728 --> 00:19:16.050]  How'd I tell you three years ago, next they'll do climate lockdowns and power outages and cut off the food?
[00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:18.430]  Because it's the damn plan.
[00:19:20.811 --> 00:19:27.233]  And there's nothing more frustrating than having the enemy playbook and telling people they're about to run this play, and they run it.
[00:19:27.553 --> 00:19:28.413]  They're about to run this play.
[00:19:28.573 --> 00:19:29.453]  They're about to run that play.
[00:19:29.793 --> 00:19:30.514]  Over and over again.
[00:19:31.154 --> 00:19:35.775]  And people slowly start to listen, but not fast enough.
[00:19:39.847 --> 00:19:43.569]  So it's a mixed bag, as they say.
[00:19:44.469 --> 00:19:46.730]  There are riots in over 100 countries.
[00:19:47.151 --> 00:19:48.551]  Major governments have fallen.
[00:19:48.951 --> 00:19:51.613]  The Japanese real Prime Minister, his party's still in power.
[00:19:52.013 --> 00:19:53.053]  Abe was still running things.
[00:19:53.374 --> 00:19:54.134]  Assassinated.
[00:19:54.854 --> 00:19:56.375]  Boris Johnson resigns.
[00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:59.256]  The head of OPEC mysteriously dies.
[00:20:02.418 --> 00:20:03.859]  Georgia guidestones are destroyed.
[00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:05.880]  The stock market crashes.
[00:20:07.054 --> 00:20:34.560]  And all over the world, people, because there's no food on the store shelves, there's no money, there's no fuel, all done by design, the central banks, the big AI systems, deliberately doing this to bring in a global crisis, to bring in their one world currency, their cashless society, their social credit score, their carbon tax, their vaccine passport.
[00:20:35.472 --> 00:20:37.353]  And they're all announcing it as a solution.
[00:20:37.614 --> 00:20:39.195]  And they said they would use it as a solution.
[00:20:43.258 --> 00:20:44.739]  But the public knows it's them.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.221]  In Europe.
[00:20:48.322 --> 00:20:49.123]  In Western Europe.
[00:20:49.243 --> 00:20:49.923]  In Eastern Europe.
[00:20:50.724 --> 00:20:51.464]  In Sri Lanka.
[00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:52.585]  In India.
[00:20:53.926 --> 00:20:55.848]  In Greece.
[00:20:56.328 --> 00:20:57.189]  In Mexico.
[00:20:57.709 --> 00:20:58.149]  Everywhere.
[00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:01.492]  It's the same thing by design.
[00:21:01.532 --> 00:21:09.357]   A complex System, computer run that the globalists know they can manipulate and shut down whenever they want.
[00:21:10.098 --> 00:21:22.340]  And they'll continue to do that to consolidate power, to double or triple their profits every year until we grow up and learn how the scam works and say no to it.
[00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:33.879]   And the good news is I've been monitoring Australia I've been monitoring New Zealand, Sri Lanka, India, Albania.
[00:21:35.539 --> 00:21:38.800]  I've been monitoring the Netherlands and Germany and France, the UK and the US.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:39.820]  I've been monitoring it all.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.521]  And the leaders of the movements are anti-New World Order.
[00:21:44.981 --> 00:21:47.582]  The signs are against Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab.
[00:21:47.962 --> 00:21:59.344]  The demands are against the central banks and those turning off the economies and saying they're going to shut down one-third of the farming in the countries this year as they announce all the new bug factories being created to feed you bugs.
[00:22:00.888 --> 00:22:06.550]  And crops, given nutrients from human dead bodies being rendered down.
[00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:17.374]  I mean, it's a dystopia that the New World Order is building and bringing forward against us, and all we gotta do is recognize them and say no to them.
[00:22:19.082 --> 00:22:38.079]  And reject the Hollywood scum, and reject the corporate media trash, who are truly mercenaries, bought and paid for, up on their pedestals, telling us to go against our instincts, to turn our children over to them, to turn our lives over to them, and to submit to their lies.
[00:22:41.582 --> 00:22:44.065]  Literal perverts.
[00:22:45.532 --> 00:23:02.518]  Literal scumbags in Austin, Texas, on the last days of school this year, we're showing you footage, dancing with the elementary students, who men dressed as women, coming to visit the school, then spend their time with them as part of pedophile pride.
[00:23:04.679 --> 00:23:09.241]  That's going on miles from where our studio is right now.
[00:23:10.281 --> 00:23:11.361]  Radio listener, you're blessed.
[00:23:11.941 --> 00:23:12.982]  You don't have to look at this.
[00:23:14.588 --> 00:23:15.660]  This is unbelievable.
[00:23:17.881 --> 00:23:25.104]  All right, when we come back, we're going to drill into all of it and more and break down what's coming next and how to defeat these people and so much more.
[00:23:25.224 --> 00:23:32.027]  Big broadcast lined up for you on this live, independent, pro-human, pro-God, pro-family, pro-human transmission.
[00:23:32.607 --> 00:23:37.309]  InfoWars.com is the coordinates of victory and resistance.
[00:23:37.168 --> 00:23:42.047]   If you're a rebel and if you want to survive and thrive, then you're sharing the articles
[00:23:42.047 --> 00:23:45.808]  and videos and live feeds from Infowars.com.
[00:23:45.808 --> 00:23:57.168]  It's never going to get any better.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.081]  Don't look for it.
[00:23:58.521 --> 00:23:59.642]  Be happy with what you got.
[00:24:00.782 --> 00:24:03.864]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[00:24:04.405 --> 00:24:06.046]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[00:24:06.446 --> 00:24:07.507]  The real owners.
[00:24:07.567 --> 00:24:12.090]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:13.691]  Forget the politicians.
[00:24:13.931 --> 00:24:17.213]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[00:24:18.774 --> 00:24:19.235]  You don't.
[00:24:19.995 --> 00:24:20.996]  You have no choice.
[00:24:21.356 --> 00:24:22.297]  You have owners.
[00:24:22.597 --> 00:24:23.518]  They own you.
[00:24:24.847 --> 00:24:26.148]  They own everything.
[00:24:26.389 --> 00:24:28.030]  They own all the important land.
[00:24:28.391 --> 00:24:30.132]  They own and control the corporations.
[00:24:30.172 --> 00:24:33.636]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[00:24:33.656 --> 00:24:35.238]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[00:24:35.578 --> 00:24:40.383]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[00:24:40.563 --> 00:24:42.185]  They got you by the balls!
[00:24:43.689 --> 00:24:45.770]  They want obedient workers.
[00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:47.731]  Obedient workers.
[00:24:48.051 --> 00:25:00.756]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[00:25:00.816 --> 00:25:04.058]  And now they're coming for your social security money.
[00:25:04.518 --> 00:25:07.179]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[00:25:08.599 --> 00:25:09.520]  It's a big club.
[00:25:10.495 --> 00:25:11.136]  And you ain't in it.
[00:25:11.156 --> 00:25:16.840]  And you said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.081]  You better believe it.
[00:25:18.181 --> 00:25:20.062]  So what specifically did they do?
[00:25:20.503 --> 00:25:25.687]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand.
[00:25:25.887 --> 00:25:26.507]  A lot of money.
[00:25:27.128 --> 00:25:29.850]  You and I are not in the big club.
[00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:32.111]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[00:25:32.752 --> 00:25:36.475]  It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[00:25:37.898 --> 00:25:39.379]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[00:25:39.739 --> 00:25:43.222]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[00:25:43.242 --> 00:25:47.184]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[00:25:47.204 --> 00:25:48.165]  They're not interested in that.
[00:25:48.425 --> 00:25:49.386]  That doesn't help them.
[00:25:49.746 --> 00:25:51.127]  That's against their interest.
[00:25:51.627 --> 00:25:52.068]  That's right.
[00:25:52.308 --> 00:25:57.431]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:26:01.634 --> 00:26:05.037]  We are now inside the Great Reset, Global Collapse, New World Order.
[00:26:06.249 --> 00:26:08.530]  Every day we're on air is a blessing to be warning the planet.
[00:26:09.051 --> 00:26:11.772]  We've built stiff resistance to them worldwide.
[00:26:12.433 --> 00:26:13.794]  Their plan will not work now.
[00:26:13.814 --> 00:26:15.955]  It will fail, but they've already committed to it.
[00:26:15.975 --> 00:26:19.357]  So it's going to be very explosive and destructive.
[00:26:19.377 --> 00:26:20.918]  We're showing you footage of Sri Lanka.
[00:26:22.819 --> 00:26:31.184]  Yesterday, as millions of people broke through the police lines and stormed the government capital complex, burning down the president's house.
[00:26:32.886 --> 00:26:34.467]  Government officials fled by helicopter.
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.280]  through Navy ships and have evacuated.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:48.879]  Our media, our control media is calling this a protest.
[00:26:49.125 --> 00:26:56.287]  Here's folks inside the government palace on the government treadmills in the government swimming pools.
[00:26:59.978 --> 00:27:07.734]  And if they don't identify it as the New World Order and globalism, it'll just be used to destabilize the country and the globals will come in and buy it up and put it in the dollar.
[00:27:09.124 --> 00:27:10.044]  And lower the standard of living.
[00:27:10.124 --> 00:27:16.907]  But, if they identify it as the New World Order, and put in a new government that's against the globalists, then they can dig out of it.
[00:27:17.487 --> 00:27:31.672]  But, in South Africa, and up in North Eastern Africa, in Kenya, and in Europe, Eastern, Western, all over the world, people are rioting because the food supply has been cut off, the energy prices are too high.
[00:27:33.132 --> 00:27:34.513]  From Italy, to Albania.
[00:27:35.947 --> 00:27:50.381]  From Canada to Mexico, the people are awake and are identifying what's happening, particularly the Dutch farmers who were told one-third of their cows must be slaughtered and they cannot do basic farming anymore because it's, quote, bad for the planet, which it's not.
[00:27:50.821 --> 00:27:55.186]  It's part of the plant destabilization, which the globalists believe will take you to your knees.
[00:27:55.846 --> 00:27:59.370]  But if you know it's them, it will take them to prison.
[00:28:01.431 --> 00:28:02.432]  Same thing in Panama.
[00:28:02.912 --> 00:28:13.560]  It's over a hundred countries right now have mass demonstrations against the supply chain breakdowns and against the starvation and energy cost, which we told you 30 months ago.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:14.921]  30 plus months ago.
[00:28:15.161 --> 00:28:17.883]  How many months ago is January and February of 2020?
[00:28:18.303 --> 00:28:20.725]  I keep saying 30 months, but a few weeks ago I did the math.
[00:28:24.287 --> 00:28:24.988]  Yeah, 30 months ago.
[00:28:25.008 --> 00:28:25.348]  30 months ago.
[00:28:28.564 --> 00:28:32.926]  We told you exactly what would happen and showed you the economic numbers and now we're here.
[00:28:33.526 --> 00:28:34.826]  And we're telling you what's coming next.
[00:28:36.027 --> 00:28:37.107]  And what is the corporate answer?
[00:28:37.227 --> 00:28:37.947]  Censor people.
[00:28:38.307 --> 00:28:39.028]  Shut people down.
[00:28:39.288 --> 00:28:54.853]  And the fools that work for Silicon Valley and all of them think they'll be protected being part of something so monstrous as a global destabilization plan to collapse fossil fuels and regular agriculture and bring in their replacement when they don't have one because they're replacing you.
[00:28:55.393 --> 00:28:56.354]  You're non-essential.
[00:28:57.254 --> 00:29:02.076]  That 30-year-old clip of George Carlin saying they just want you dumb enough to do the paperwork and run the machines.
[00:29:02.416 --> 00:29:07.897]  They don't need you to do the paperwork and run the machines anymore because it's artificial intelligence.
[00:29:08.037 --> 00:29:08.818]  It's robots.
[00:29:09.078 --> 00:29:22.382]  And they've announced it in every damn establishment publication from The Economist to the Sunday Times of London to the Washington Post and the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.
[00:29:23.715 --> 00:29:30.198]  They're announcing that we're collapsing this on purpose as part of a great new transition.
[00:29:30.518 --> 00:29:44.943]  Joe Biden, the puppet president, the placeholder for Obama's third administration, said on Friday, I played the clip on the Saturday show, he said, yeah, it's not Putin and that's not the gas stations.
[00:29:46.244 --> 00:29:47.324]  He got off the teleprompter.
[00:29:48.205 --> 00:29:51.426]  He said, it's a great transition.
[00:29:53.114 --> 00:30:00.599]  That we're part of, and so has the head of the Energy Department, the head of the Department of Commerce and Transportation, and all of them.
[00:30:00.619 --> 00:30:20.514]  So when you see the footage from Sri Lanka, and Peru, and Albania, and the Netherlands, they call it protest when they burn down buildings.
[00:30:24.943 --> 00:30:27.185]  Because they want the destabilization worldwide.
[00:30:27.845 --> 00:30:29.927]  But here in the heart of the empire, they don't.
[00:30:30.868 --> 00:30:31.308]  Not yet.
[00:30:31.428 --> 00:30:36.453]  They want to bring down the cities, bring down the police, bring down the... to bring in their control.
[00:30:37.734 --> 00:30:41.597]  But they don't want the actual revolution they control yet.
[00:30:43.939 --> 00:30:46.261]  So we've got to educate the public about the main players.
[00:30:46.281 --> 00:30:49.344]  And we've got to do it right now.
[00:30:50.044 --> 00:30:53.127]  But it's a very simple economic equation that's well known.
[00:30:54.685 --> 00:31:07.813]  If you go above 50% of the average family for food costs and energy, and in many of these countries it's 60-70%, you get total absolute bedlam.
[00:31:09.834 --> 00:31:25.615]   Which further destroys infrastructure, further destroys supply chain, further destroys confidence, and then there's the new world order Ready to swoop in with all the answers to all the problems.
[00:31:27.555 --> 00:31:45.820]  And then we have the paradox, the paradox of people that go along with this, the university professors, the bureaucrats, the talk show host, all of them, just believing in, you know, well, I'll take care of myself, I'll follow the talking points, and then I'll be protected down the road.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:56.535]   When you're destroying The infrastructure and the economy and the due process and the chivalry that has protected everyone.
[00:31:57.396 --> 00:32:11.270]  I'm going to go to break and I'm going to come back with the depopulation announcements that have been made, big Trump news, big economy news, big COVID-19 new lockdown news, new you will eat bug news, new abortion fight news, and so much more.
[00:32:11.310 --> 00:32:12.712]  But I just want listeners to understand something.
[00:32:15.285 --> 00:32:16.787]  We have great products everybody needs.
[00:32:17.628 --> 00:32:19.991]  And if you buy those products now, we'll be able to stay on the air.
[00:32:20.973 --> 00:32:23.936]  But when I tell you, I look out a year from now, I don't think we'll be able to stay on air.
[00:32:24.697 --> 00:32:29.243]  I believe, on current trajectory, we may be able to change this, that things are so bad.
[00:32:30.441 --> 00:32:36.243]  That minus big donors keeping us on air, I don't know how we're going to do it, because believe me, you see the numbers.
[00:32:36.943 --> 00:32:40.184]  The takedown of the factories, the takedown of the infrastructure is insane.

[00:33:50.348 --> 00:33:52.588]  and the heart of the resistance.
[00:33:52.752 --> 00:33:54.453]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:58.656 --> 00:34:03.358]  I am here to reveal my hidden talent, eating micro-livestock.
[00:34:03.518 --> 00:34:04.179]  Corn worms.
[00:34:04.899 --> 00:34:06.360]  They're still alive.
[00:34:10.342 --> 00:34:10.482]  Mmm.
[00:34:11.522 --> 00:34:12.043]  Extraordinary.
[00:34:13.067 --> 00:34:14.447]  Mmm!
[00:34:14.547 --> 00:34:15.388]  Very moist.
[00:34:15.688 --> 00:34:16.068]  Chewy.
[00:34:16.348 --> 00:34:20.009]  Can't quite describe the flavor, but... I need a little water.
[00:34:21.789 --> 00:34:24.189]  Let's try the second glass, shall we?
[00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:27.330]  Just a little side note.
[00:34:28.130 --> 00:34:31.351]  Two billion people in the world eat bugs, and I'm one of them.
[00:34:31.771 --> 00:34:32.551]  So here we go.
[00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:35.092]  Have some me worms.
[00:34:38.633 --> 00:34:40.553]  I'm telling you, I'd win Survivor.
[00:34:43.874 --> 00:34:45.755]  That is a frouchy taste.
[00:34:46.136 --> 00:34:46.876]  I'd recommend it.
[00:34:47.076 --> 00:34:49.218]  Here we have... Oh!
[00:34:50.379 --> 00:34:50.779]  Crickets!
[00:34:51.019 --> 00:34:51.720]  Oh, nothing.
[00:34:53.521 --> 00:34:53.621]  Oh!
[00:34:54.602 --> 00:34:54.922]  Awesome.
[00:34:56.403 --> 00:34:57.965]  Like nothing you've ever tasted.
[00:34:58.245 --> 00:35:03.209]  Like... a hairy... nut.
[00:35:04.690 --> 00:35:05.330]  Don't!
[00:35:06.091 --> 00:35:06.911]  Oh my gosh.
[00:35:07.452 --> 00:35:08.593]  A nut from the shell.
[00:35:10.839 --> 00:35:16.423]  And now for dessert, the fried grasshopper.
[00:35:16.523 --> 00:35:21.747]  These are amazing.
[00:35:22.968 --> 00:35:27.932]  These are exquisite grasshoppers.
[00:35:28.773 --> 00:35:31.275]  I recommend them to anyone.
[00:35:31.715 --> 00:35:35.038]  Thank you for spending so much time with me and watching me eat bugs.
[00:35:35.598 --> 00:35:37.740]  These are grasshopper kebabs.
[00:35:38.806 --> 00:35:40.467]  Teriyaki marinated.
[00:35:41.048 --> 00:35:41.868]  Quite delicious.
[00:35:42.048 --> 00:35:44.390]  I heartily encourage that you try one.
[00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:45.051]  Okay.
[00:35:45.291 --> 00:35:46.151]  Anna, do you want to try it?
[00:35:46.171 --> 00:35:46.912]  Do you want to try one?
[00:35:47.713 --> 00:35:48.993]  I am trying for everyone.
[00:35:49.394 --> 00:35:51.455]  You try it?
[00:35:52.296 --> 00:35:52.496]  Yes?
[00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:53.537]  No?
[00:35:53.837 --> 00:35:53.937]  Yes?
[00:35:53.957 --> 00:35:54.938]  You gotta have to.
[00:35:54.978 --> 00:35:55.798]  You gotta have to.
[00:35:55.898 --> 00:35:57.239]  I am going to try it.
[00:35:57.379 --> 00:35:57.760]  Alright.
[00:35:59.521 --> 00:36:00.322]  Go ahead.
[00:36:00.362 --> 00:36:00.542]  Cheers.
[00:36:00.582 --> 00:36:00.942]  You win.
[00:36:01.142 --> 00:36:03.142]  I did it already.
[00:36:03.142 --> 00:36:05.142]  [Cheering]
[00:36:05.142 --> 00:36:07.142]  [Cheering]
[00:36:07.142 --> 00:36:09.142]  Yes, Travis!
[00:36:09.142 --> 00:36:11.142]  It's alright, Travis!
[00:36:11.142 --> 00:36:13.142]  [Cheering]
[00:36:13.142 --> 00:36:15.142]  You know, I wouldn't serve it if it wasn't good.
[00:36:15.632 --> 00:36:16.892]  That's my motto.
[00:36:19.414 --> 00:36:25.558]  So, you know, also right here, if you have kids, you're always serving them ants on a log with raisins.
[00:36:25.738 --> 00:36:26.879]  Come on, really.
[00:36:26.899 --> 00:36:29.981]  These are ants on a log with ants.
[00:36:31.112 --> 00:36:32.673]  So these are actual ants?
[00:36:32.733 --> 00:36:34.414]  These are black ants from China.
[00:36:34.494 --> 00:36:37.956]  And you know, in China, they say that ants are medicinal.
[00:36:37.976 --> 00:36:38.597]  They sell what it is.
[00:36:38.677 --> 00:36:41.218]  And in China, they're executed by the disgrace of the government.
[00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.300]  And in China, they're still in lockdown.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:45.181]  And in China, they're communists.
[00:36:46.582 --> 00:36:48.303]  And in China, they have a one-child policy.
[00:36:49.824 --> 00:36:52.726]  You can say, oh, this is just fear factor Joe Rogan 2.0.
[00:36:53.767 --> 00:36:56.688]  No, it's official UN Klaus Schwab dogma.
[00:36:57.229 --> 00:37:00.591]  You will eat some bugs, you will own nothing, you will have nothing, you will like it.
[00:37:03.618 --> 00:37:05.720]  They are teaching you that pedophilia is good.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.101]  They're teaching you that euthanasia is good.
[00:37:08.141 --> 00:37:11.424]  They're teaching you that killing born babies is good.
[00:37:11.724 --> 00:37:17.688]  They're teaching you to put up with being run over and giving up your life force and your survival instinct.
[00:37:19.489 --> 00:37:30.997]  And everything we do here is about getting you to rediscover that life force and getting you to help others rediscover it and realizing we're being set up, we're being attacked.
[00:37:31.017 --> 00:37:33.099]  These are obviously the bad guys.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:40.283]  You read further into their official battle plans, they talk about the post-human world.
[00:37:42.184 --> 00:37:44.206]  How they're ending civilization.
[00:37:44.246 --> 00:37:50.770]  And yeah, we're lazy, we're dumbed down, many of us, but the people running it help do it, and are the worst people on Earth.
[00:37:54.892 --> 00:37:57.354]  So the global meltdown is here, the global collapse is here.
[00:37:58.914 --> 00:38:03.095]  And the globalists thought they could do this, impose as the saviors, bring in their new system.
[00:38:03.495 --> 00:38:08.357]  But around the world, and I salute people fighting back peacefully, they're losing.
[00:38:08.557 --> 00:38:12.258]  And the population knows what they're facing.
[00:38:13.038 --> 00:38:27.803]  They want to have governments they control do bad policies, have us destroy our own governments, everything collapses, and then they come in with their new policies as the saviors that make things a hundred times worse.
[00:38:29.795 --> 00:38:39.281]  And remember, when they overthrow governments around the world and storm government buildings and attack politicians, our media says it's a peaceful protest.
[00:38:39.982 --> 00:38:42.143]  But when a million people show up in D.C.
[00:38:42.203 --> 00:38:47.607]  and 600, 700 go into the Capitol, most of them peaceful, waved in by police, it's worse than Pearl Harbor.
[00:38:47.687 --> 00:38:49.228]  It's worse than 9-11.
[00:38:49.328 --> 00:38:50.629]  They said that!
[00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:56.413]  That, ladies and gentlemen, is called brainwashing.
[00:38:57.894 --> 00:39:05.553]   That's called Saying don't believe your lying eyes, don't believe your smell, your taste, your touch, don't believe your five senses or your six senses.
[00:39:08.174 --> 00:39:09.214]  Go along with our fraud.
[00:39:11.435 --> 00:39:21.378]  Now I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen stacks of news here.
[00:39:24.459 --> 00:39:27.120]  And I intend when we start the next hour to cover quite a bit of this.
[00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:30.471]  And what we know is going to come next.
[00:39:30.491 --> 00:39:32.172]  And we're going to do it.
[00:39:33.953 --> 00:39:49.410]   But at the end of the day, if we do not expose the fact that this is a world government, corporate ideology to destroy all their cultures, all their systems of unity, and to make us absolutely dependent and pathetic, So they can have their way with us.
[00:39:49.570 --> 00:39:52.772]  If you don't realize that, nothing else matters.
[00:39:53.092 --> 00:40:09.484]  Because all the pedophilia and all the chemical infertility and all the endocrine disruptors and all the attacks and everything else that flows from this thing are symptoms of the larger problem and the larger globalist disease.
[00:40:12.546 --> 00:40:14.427]  And so we're going to expose that in the next hour.
[00:40:14.927 --> 00:40:16.909]  Then Owen Schroeder takes over with Sunday Live.
[00:40:17.977 --> 00:40:23.736]   6 p.m. and then we come back weekday mornings and info wars calm and on many radio and TV stations across the country
[00:40:23.736 --> 00:40:27.937]   at 8 a.m Central with the wonderful informative dynamic all those
[00:40:27.937 --> 00:40:34.387]   amazing guests Harrison Smith 8 to 11 a.m And then Alex Jones, you're truly for four hours. No insurer
[00:40:34.387 --> 00:40:42.597]   for three hours and we are embattled and We are so victorious and we are thanks to you and our
[00:40:42.597 --> 00:40:54.550]   guests this whole organization is legendary and And really is the most dynamic, most effective, most over-the-target organization there is.
[00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:58.052]  And that all glory goes to God, and of course, God working through you.
[00:40:59.652 --> 00:41:01.653]  But I cannot stress enough to you to understand that.
[00:41:03.054 --> 00:41:36.181]   But let that sink in, because my greatest frustration is watching the collapse of civilization And knowing that day's coming, if the enemy continues to push their operation and we don't stop them, to where they start turning the power off on a routine basis, they have fake cyber attacks they launch, they use for total expanded censorship control, where they arrest their political opposition, and then you will look back on these days of very hard turmoil, and of
[00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:43.016]  Death and suicide and bankruptcy and collapse as the good old days.
[00:41:45.058 --> 00:41:46.339]  And so that's where we are right now.
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:59.389]  And I am extremely honored and extremely blessed to be here with you on this Sunday night, July 10th, 2022, talking about this.
[00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:13.443]   But there's just such a sense of urgency and I want all of you From the listeners and viewers, from our affiliates and sponsors, this great crew I'm looking at right now, to just let it burn into your brains that this is real!
[00:42:14.482 --> 00:42:25.632]  There's thousands of fake political movements and millions of different choices of entertainment and all these false corporate-controlled cultures, but we're here really looking at State Department Random 200.
[00:42:26.553 --> 00:42:29.255]  We're really here looking at the Club of Rome plans, 1967.
[00:42:30.516 --> 00:42:32.898]  We're really here with the Lake Bilderberg Group documents.
[00:42:33.159 --> 00:42:36.422]  We're really here looking at Operation Lockstep.
[00:42:36.502 --> 00:42:37.623]  We're really here.
[00:42:39.491 --> 00:42:42.673]  Listening and watching to what Klaus Schwab and the Bilderberg Group do.
[00:42:42.974 --> 00:42:43.894]  That's what the Bilderberg Group.
[00:42:44.455 --> 00:42:45.536]  That's who runs Davos.
[00:42:47.697 --> 00:42:50.820]  And... We're in the real world.
[00:42:52.381 --> 00:42:53.842]  That's why there's such a hubbub.
[00:42:53.882 --> 00:42:55.803]  That's why everybody's so upset in the power structure.
[00:42:56.184 --> 00:43:04.590]  That's why, because they know this is all real and they don't even want their own henchmen and their own minions listening to this because they already see what's going on.
[00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:07.132]  They know I'm telling the truth and it completely blows them away.
[00:43:07.152 --> 00:43:08.073]  Let me give you the rest of the good news.
[00:43:09.821 --> 00:43:11.422]  Because we're in a bad situation.
[00:43:14.202 --> 00:43:21.202]  A kettle of fish, as they say.
[00:43:21.202 --> 00:43:25.202]  Many people that made millions of dollars in the system...
[00:43:25.171 --> 00:43:30.115]  Now know it's predatory and pure evil and now can look down the road and see they'll be destroyed as well.
[00:43:30.416 --> 00:43:35.260]  And they understand that due process and chivalry and civilization is good.
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.361]  Because what is it to have $100 billion or $20 billion or $190 billion?
[00:43:37.642 --> 00:43:43.802]   or 20 billion dollars or 190 billion dollars. If it's fiat and it's a lie and if you're not going
[00:43:43.802 --> 00:43:49.962]   to have a civilization to spend it in and you can look at what's happening and know there's
[00:43:49.962 --> 00:43:54.201]   not going to be globalist reservations and break off civilizations that succeed.
[00:43:54.391 --> 00:44:01.673]  You can see the whole thing is a trick of Satan and is bringing all of civilization and the world down and you decide to not be part of it.
[00:44:02.614 --> 00:44:05.475]  That's the real due sex in this whole situation.
[00:44:06.175 --> 00:44:07.355]  That's the real wild card.
[00:44:07.375 --> 00:44:10.716]  Hour number two live straight ahead.
[00:44:10.756 --> 00:44:12.417]  I think I'll open the phones up as well.
[00:44:15.117 --> 00:44:18.759]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:44:18.659 --> 00:44:32.459]   distance. In April of 2022, Biden's Energy Department, led by the great reset minion,
[00:44:32.459 --> 00:44:40.059]   Jennifer Granholm, announced the sale of 950,000 strategic petroleum reserve barrels to Unipec,
[00:44:40.059 --> 00:44:43.858]  or Sinopec, which is wholly owned by the Chinese government.
[00:44:44.055 --> 00:44:49.781]  As of last month, more than 5 million barrels of oil were released from the U.S.
[00:44:49.961 --> 00:44:51.302]  emergency reserves.
[00:44:51.643 --> 00:44:57.669]  At least one of those shipments of American crude went to China, according to Reuters.
[00:44:57.789 --> 00:45:09.656]   In 2015, a private equity firm co-founded by Hunter Biden Bo High Harvest, RST, previously owned a stake in the Sinopec marketing, valued at $1.7 million.
[00:45:10.436 --> 00:45:18.019]  While Americans plummet headlong into a recession and gas prices double, the Biden family is selling off our assets.
[00:45:18.159 --> 00:45:19.640]  This is high treason.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:28.550]  Today, President Biden announced a plan to release one million barrels of oil a day for the next 180 days from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
[00:45:28.891 --> 00:45:31.173]  It is the largest release since its creation.
[00:45:31.854 --> 00:45:38.262]  How long is it fair to expect American drivers and drivers around the world to pay that premium for this war?
[00:45:39.145 --> 00:45:40.046]  As long as it takes.
[00:45:40.306 --> 00:45:48.755]  And in addition to getting other nations to move forward, a total of 240 million barrels of oil to release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
[00:45:49.195 --> 00:45:53.119]  At 1 million barrels per day, that is the largest release in U.S.
[00:45:53.179 --> 00:45:53.580]  history.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:57.404]  And it amounts to roughly a third of the Reserve's current supply.
[00:45:57.967 --> 00:46:09.593]  We are living in a present when the enormity of Joe Biden's treason is finally coming to light, even to those who refuse to see his central role in Klaus Schwab's Great Reset.
[00:46:09.673 --> 00:46:19.518]  But the greatest threat on this front springs from the distinct liberal and external actors who equate their success with fracturing the liberal international order.
[00:46:20.745 --> 00:46:29.051]  To limit global warming, you are demanding to halt to coal, oil and gas exploration.
[00:46:30.272 --> 00:46:34.555]  To the development and to the financing of this exploration.
[00:46:35.596 --> 00:46:47.164]  As well, you are asking firms to replace any corporate board directors who is unwilling to transition to cleaner energy sources.
[00:46:47.184 --> 00:46:54.149]   And when it comes to the gas prices, We're going through an incredible transition.
[00:46:55.780 --> 00:47:24.553]  And as food and energy are systematically dismantled, and as China and India siphon off American fuel reserves, while American inflation is at a historic high, Biden has already signed off $54 billion in taxpayer dollars to his corrupt partners in Ukraine, along with a laundry list of military aid.
[00:47:24.813 --> 00:47:27.354]  Based on our investigative units reporting, the U.S.
[00:47:27.394 --> 00:47:30.656]  Attorney in Delaware has been probing a number of issues.
[00:47:30.716 --> 00:47:41.682]  They include tax fraud, tax evasion, money laundering, as well as whether Hunter James Biden and their business associates complied with foreign lobbying laws.
[00:47:42.082 --> 00:48:02.903]  The sooner Americans comprehend that heavily compromised Joe Biden is merely the puppet of New World Order globalist sabotage to destroy the United States, the sooner we can salvage what is left of our borders, our military, our elections, our economy, our energy, our schools, our farmland, and our future.
[00:48:03.144 --> 00:48:04.325]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:48:08.962 --> 00:48:10.384]  We are drugged out!
[00:48:11.024 --> 00:48:13.307]  We are following other people's opinions!
[00:48:14.463 --> 00:48:16.685]  We are controlled by the media.
[00:48:17.265 --> 00:48:18.826]  Today, it all changes.
[00:48:19.126 --> 00:48:21.628]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[00:48:21.888 --> 00:48:24.750]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[00:48:24.951 --> 00:48:29.454]  Einstein says the death and insanity is doing the same thing, expecting a different result.
[00:48:29.714 --> 00:48:32.496]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[00:48:32.536 --> 00:48:34.898]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[00:48:35.218 --> 00:48:37.159]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:39.081]  Why don't we just try love?
[00:48:39.321 --> 00:48:40.482]  We have the resources.
[00:48:43.527 --> 00:48:47.271]  Sometimes you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.652]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[00:48:48.832 --> 00:48:50.414]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[00:48:50.454 --> 00:48:51.334]  They say Trump's crazy.
[00:48:51.535 --> 00:48:52.415]  They say I'm crazy.
[00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:54.818]  But I'm here to show love.
[00:48:54.998 --> 00:48:58.681]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[00:49:00.183 --> 00:49:03.706]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:49:04.086 --> 00:49:06.286]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:49:06.286 --> 00:49:32.186]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:49:32.186 --> 00:49:33.507]  (upbeat music)
[00:49:33.414 --> 00:49:38.414]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:49:38.414 --> 00:49:45.914]  [MUSIC]
[00:49:45.914 --> 00:49:48.914]  Remember, the New World Order has its plan.
[00:49:49.366 --> 00:49:50.788]  God has his plan.
[00:49:51.721 --> 00:49:53.683]  We're following God's plan, not their plan.
[00:49:53.703 --> 00:49:55.664]  They will be defeated.
[00:49:55.844 --> 00:49:59.648]  Even as they launch their operations, their system is collapsing.
[00:50:00.789 --> 00:50:07.314]  Everything they've got is bet on the fact that you won't expose the UN, Francois Bill Gates and the big corporations running this.
[00:50:07.334 --> 00:50:16.522]  All right, I want to hit a bunch of news right now, and I want to open the phones up specifically for first-time callers on this Sunday night.
[00:50:16.562 --> 00:50:22.404]   Starting next time, we're going to your calls on What is it like to live in the new world order?
[00:50:22.765 --> 00:50:26.647]  I mean, Biden said we're in a new world order, a liberal world order, a transition.
[00:50:26.748 --> 00:50:27.448]  That's not debatable.
[00:50:28.229 --> 00:50:31.191]  You can call in and say I'm wrong, but I think it's easy to say.
[00:50:31.211 --> 00:50:32.172]  I think it's truthful to say.
[00:50:32.912 --> 00:50:38.316]  What is it like to live in a corporate, private, fascist world government that's above the law?
[00:50:39.037 --> 00:50:40.578]  And are you going to just submit to it?
[00:50:40.678 --> 00:50:42.559]  Or where do you think this is going next?
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.281]  And how do we peacefully stand up?
[00:50:44.301 --> 00:50:47.183]  And I know this great audience of activists who are in the arena.
[00:50:48.522 --> 00:51:03.709]  Stand with the people in the Netherlands, the Dutch people, and stand with the Indian people, and the Sri Lankan people, the people in Albania, and the people in Panama, and the people in a hundred plus countries saying no to their corrupt governments that are controlled by the globalists.
[00:51:03.909 --> 00:51:10.732]  Because they're not trying to tear down their governments, they're trying to take over their governments and put their people back in charge against the new world order.
[00:51:11.072 --> 00:51:12.513]  That's where we thread the needle.
[00:51:14.147 --> 00:51:15.288]  The toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:51:15.308 --> 00:51:15.348]  877-789-2539.

[00:51:15.648 --> 00:51:15.688]  877-789-2539.
[00:51:15.708 --> 00:51:16.308]  First, time callers on.
[00:51:16.328 --> 00:51:17.369]  We're inside the New World Order.
[00:51:17.389 --> 00:51:18.910]  We're inside the banning of cows and fuel.
[00:51:18.930 --> 00:51:21.732]  We're inside, we're turning your food off to make you transition.
[00:51:21.552 --> 00:51:31.990]   877-789-ALEX. 877-789-2539. First time callers on. We're inside the New World
[00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:36.592]   Order. We're inside the banning of cows and fuel. We're inside we're turning your

[00:51:43.032 --> 00:51:46.711]  gonna take your phone calls tonight.
[00:51:45.283 --> 00:51:54.252]  Only get about 10 calls on the board because I don't want anybody to hold because coming up in 52 minutes, Owen Schroer takes over with Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m.
[00:51:54.292 --> 00:51:56.614]  here on the InfoWars Radio TV Network.
[00:51:56.994 --> 00:51:59.176]  That again, the globalists don't have full control.
[00:51:59.597 --> 00:52:00.437]  We're still on air.
[00:52:00.598 --> 00:52:01.739]  They can't stand it.
[00:52:03.460 --> 00:52:04.641]  It drives them crazy.
[00:52:05.629 --> 00:52:18.952]  When I sit back and really look at the success, all of us, this family, the viewers, the listeners, the supporters, the sponsors, the crew, the guests, what we've done is incredible and all glory goes to God.
[00:52:19.192 --> 00:52:23.833]  But I tell you now, our most important work ever is at hand.
[00:52:26.854 --> 00:52:28.394]  I can't tell you the adventure it is.
[00:52:28.414 --> 00:52:30.474]  Because I'm a public figure.
[00:52:31.134 --> 00:52:33.195]  Our audience of great people aren't, thank God you're not.
[00:52:34.611 --> 00:52:35.471]  It's got its pitfalls.
[00:52:36.212 --> 00:52:38.032]  But to wear an Alex Jones was right shirt.
[00:52:38.812 --> 00:52:40.273]  Or an Infowars.com shirt.
[00:52:41.693 --> 00:52:44.794]  In red areas, they'll probably buy your lunch or carry it on their shoulders.
[00:52:45.194 --> 00:52:48.055]  You might meet your next, you know, your next best friend.
[00:52:48.956 --> 00:52:50.156]  Might meet your husband, your wife.
[00:52:51.617 --> 00:52:53.097]  You're in a blue area, you might get killed.
[00:52:54.457 --> 00:52:55.638]  The adventure of wearing.
[00:52:56.664 --> 00:52:57.786]  Alex Jones is right shirt.
[00:52:58.607 --> 00:53:00.529]  We've got the designer shirt, a regular shirt.
[00:53:00.549 --> 00:53:01.250]  They're both excellent.
[00:53:01.591 --> 00:53:02.572]  Then forward to our calm.

[00:54:32.521 --> 00:54:34.221]  It's like 40-50% markup depending on the product.
[00:54:34.602 --> 00:54:36.803]  Most foods have like a three times markup at the grocery store.

[00:55:16.036 --> 00:55:26.034]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:55:17.935 --> 00:55:20.736]  This is news out of Spain.
[00:55:22.717 --> 00:55:24.318]  Also Portugal and others are announcing it.
[00:55:24.398 --> 00:55:25.518]  A fifth dose is needed.
[00:55:25.578 --> 00:55:26.638]  Israel also said this.
[00:55:27.619 --> 00:55:28.659]  And there's the article right there.
[00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:30.920]  Erases your immune system.
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:33.481]  Denali National Park in Alaska.
[00:55:33.501 --> 00:55:34.021]  I've never been there.
[00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:34.481]  I want to go.
[00:55:35.542 --> 00:55:37.082]  Brings back mask mandates.
[00:55:37.142 --> 00:55:39.223]  Joins five other parks with reinstatements.
[00:55:39.243 --> 00:55:40.464]  They're coming back with the lockdowns.
[00:55:40.904 --> 00:55:42.604]  Come back with the masks after the election.
[00:55:42.924 --> 00:55:44.145]  Those documents have been leaked.
[00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:46.771]  Look at this political fact statement.
[00:55:47.211 --> 00:55:48.351]  This just came out last week.
[00:55:50.072 --> 00:55:56.394]  Biden says that we must make all medical workers take these shots because it gives you 100% protection from the virus.
[00:55:56.454 --> 00:55:57.375]  It means you can't spread it.
[00:55:57.795 --> 00:55:59.455]  All a total lie on record.
[00:56:01.736 --> 00:56:03.537]  New survey reveals significant doubts.
[00:56:03.577 --> 00:56:06.258]  The vast majority of Americans don't think the vaccine works.
[00:56:06.318 --> 00:56:07.118]  It's not a vaccine.
[00:56:07.698 --> 00:56:09.299]  And know that masks don't work.
[00:56:09.439 --> 00:56:11.100]  Huge article from Zero Hedge.
[00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:12.160]  Big national polls.
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:13.481]  Infowars.com.
[00:56:13.901 --> 00:56:17.155]   But then you've got All these LibTard articles.
[00:56:19.256 --> 00:56:28.837]  Dr. James Smith of York U wearing his Bane Batman outfit in a bakery yesterday.
[00:56:28.957 --> 00:56:31.398]  Big male maskless customer using cash.
[00:56:31.438 --> 00:56:32.258]  That's even dirtier.
[00:56:33.538 --> 00:56:36.879]  Turns around and sees me and four older women all wearing masks.
[00:56:37.379 --> 00:56:40.980]  Sheepishly he says, okay, I guess I should be wearing a mask.
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.060]  You know, that's a made up story.
[00:56:42.807 --> 00:56:50.771]  But it's all about shaming you into the mental psychology of you're dirty, you're bad, so these high priests of control can brainwash you.
[00:56:51.231 --> 00:56:55.153]  Los Angeles set to reinstate the mask mandates.
[00:56:59.335 --> 00:57:05.598]  But more and more people are saying no.
[00:57:06.903 --> 00:57:07.343]  The fraud.
[00:57:08.144 --> 00:57:09.625]  And it's all about depopulation.
[00:57:09.645 --> 00:57:10.866]  It's all about humans being dirty.
[00:57:11.287 --> 00:57:12.528]  It's all about humans being bad.
[00:57:12.808 --> 00:57:14.830]  Look at this Economist publication.
[00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:16.611]  A Mother Rothschild headline.
[00:57:17.232 --> 00:57:19.994]  Low fertility is here to stay.
[00:57:20.955 --> 00:57:22.156]  We should embrace it.
[00:57:23.877 --> 00:57:26.339]  Yeah, don't ask why sperm counts are down 90%.
[00:57:27.901 --> 00:57:30.143]  Don't ask why autism's up 10,000%.
[00:57:30.923 --> 00:57:31.424]  Don't ask.
[00:57:31.524 --> 00:57:34.026]  Just embrace your death.
[00:57:35.686 --> 00:57:44.273]  And if you can't kill a baby in the womb or after they're born, get them as little kids to have their testicles cut off or their ovaries or breasts cut off.
[00:57:44.614 --> 00:57:46.655]  And I went to the doctor and said, cut my finger off.
[00:57:46.675 --> 00:57:48.777]  They called the paddy wagon to the mental institution.
[00:57:49.057 --> 00:57:54.202]  But oh, if I want to cut my son's balls off, it's a good thing.
[00:57:54.282 --> 00:57:55.203]  It's a liberal thing.
[00:57:57.284 --> 00:58:01.568]  From safe and legal and rare to we love killing babies.
[00:58:02.929 --> 00:58:03.890]  A new incredible clip.
[00:58:05.236 --> 00:58:07.576]  Pro-abortion protesters screams, we love killing babies.
[00:58:07.797 --> 00:58:09.417]  We have hours of this, but it's a new clip.
[00:58:09.537 --> 00:58:12.537]  We'll air coming back next segment.
[00:58:12.537 --> 00:58:17.037]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:58:17.037 --> 00:58:19.037]  And it goes on and on.
[00:58:19.119 --> 00:58:24.420]  Oh, and all the churches now have the rainbow flags and protect trans kids.
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:30.181]  Progressivism will hollow out your religion and wear its skin like a trophy.
[00:58:30.801 --> 00:58:34.962]  Boy, that is perfectly said.
[00:58:38.336 --> 00:58:39.497]  Then we have Austin, Texas.
[00:58:40.037 --> 00:58:45.900]  I can't homeschool my kids because they need to be properly socialized with pedophiles coming to visit them at the schools.
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:50.742]  Democrat judge blocks Texas from investigating two families cutting their children's testicles off.
[00:58:51.843 --> 00:58:54.424]  Yeah, you know, you spank your kid, they'll take them away.
[00:58:55.004 --> 00:59:00.187]  But if you want to cut their balls off, well then, my goodness, why didn't you just say so?
[00:59:01.127 --> 00:59:03.228]  Or cut your daughter's breast off, that's even more liberal.
[00:59:03.749 --> 00:59:06.949]   Some of them have their uteruses cut out. That's even more liberal.
[00:59:06.949 --> 00:59:15.549]  [MUSIC]
[00:59:15.549 --> 00:59:19.829]  Me, which I'm not counted for, lose the chops.
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:34.925]  So we will see definitely a lot of anger already now, but probably increase by the end of the year because this crisis will be with us until we really have found a remedy.
[00:59:35.586 --> 00:59:39.072]  So, we have to prepare for a more angry world.
[00:59:39.873 --> 00:59:42.117]  And how to prepare?
[00:59:43.159 --> 00:59:46.746]  It means to take the necessary action to create a fairer world.
[00:59:48.135 --> 00:59:55.335]   to see that we provide everybody with decent access to the health system,
[00:59:55.335 --> 01:00:04.456]   that we make sure that those people who are really left behind, and I'm not speaking only
[01:00:04.456 --> 01:00:09.815]   on national level, I'm speaking also internationally, I see now the tragedy.
[01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:19.815]  That's a very poor argument.
[01:00:19.815 --> 01:00:32.936]  We love killing babies.
[01:00:33.195 --> 01:00:39.458]  Klaus Schwab wants to make it a fair world after he locked down the world economy, released the deadly virus, pushed the poison shot.
[01:00:41.627 --> 01:00:42.708]  It's Sunday, July 10th.
[01:00:42.728 --> 01:00:44.690]  We're well into the second hour here.
[01:00:44.730 --> 01:00:46.331]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[01:00:46.351 --> 01:00:51.015]  Sabrina, Mark, Vinny, Betty, Larkin, Don, Brian, and others.
[01:00:53.337 --> 01:00:55.618]  Let's talk to Larkin first in FEMA Region 8.
[01:00:56.099 --> 01:00:58.060]  What is it like to be in the middle of the New World Order?
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:04.205]  Because Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Joe Biden, they all admit we're in the liberal New World Order right now.
[01:01:04.586 --> 01:01:06.908]  What's it like for you to be living in the New World Order?
[01:01:08.229 --> 01:01:08.889]  It's incredible.
[01:01:10.205 --> 01:01:13.147]  I've got Bill Gates taking over farmland just down the road.
[01:01:14.608 --> 01:01:18.011]  The Attorney General here in North Dakota is perfectly fine with that.
[01:01:19.072 --> 01:01:26.438]  And, I don't know, as a meatpacker, I'm seeing farmers come in, making no money, farms going under.
[01:01:27.879 --> 01:01:28.760]  It's crazy.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:35.145]  We're watching the implementation of Cloward v. Piven, the devaluation of our dollar.
[01:01:35.165 --> 01:01:38.227]  You can hardly fill your gas tank for less than $100.
[01:01:41.888 --> 01:01:43.849]  It's wild times to be alive.
[01:01:43.869 --> 01:01:46.131]  Larkin, are folks waking up in North Dakota?
[01:01:47.552 --> 01:01:47.872]  They are.
[01:01:47.892 --> 01:01:49.293]  Stickers all over.
[01:01:49.433 --> 01:01:50.594]  Defend the First Amendment.
[01:01:51.455 --> 01:01:53.977]  Stop signs with arrest Bill Gates stickers.
[01:01:54.037 --> 01:01:57.239]  They're popping up everywhere.
[01:01:57.299 --> 01:01:58.780]  People are talking in the diners.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.201]  They're talking in the gas stations.
[01:02:00.822 --> 01:02:11.632]   They have had it and it's wonderful to see this movement across the world of people, you know, waking up to Who the puppet masters really are.
[01:02:11.732 --> 01:02:18.696]  People aren't aware of BlackRock and who these corporate rulers really are.
[01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:20.477]  They need to watch Monopoly.
[01:02:20.597 --> 01:02:21.458]  Who owns the world?
[01:02:21.918 --> 01:02:22.218]  I agree.
[01:02:22.258 --> 01:02:23.219]  Let me say this, Larkin.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.701]  I want to give you the credit.
[01:02:26.821 --> 01:02:28.102]  It's not just me that gets it.
[01:02:28.142 --> 01:02:28.943]  It's all of us together.
[01:02:29.563 --> 01:02:33.506]  You understand that what you've done, you called in.
[01:02:33.606 --> 01:02:34.447]  You're obviously a listener.
[01:02:34.467 --> 01:02:35.127]  You spread the word.
[01:02:35.448 --> 01:02:38.010]  What we've done together, brother, is so positive.
[01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:39.271]  I'm getting chills right now.
[01:02:39.431 --> 01:02:40.772]  We've not been caught flat-footed.
[01:02:41.092 --> 01:02:44.094]  So they're executing this, counting on us, not knowing it's them.
[01:02:44.555 --> 01:02:45.195]  They're screwed.
[01:02:45.275 --> 01:02:46.596]  How do you see that unfolding?
[01:02:46.636 --> 01:02:52.081]  Because when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object, that is explosive.
[01:02:54.013 --> 01:02:55.074]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:02:55.114 --> 01:03:16.349]  And people are... I mean, we've got the whole show trial with January 6th, and you see how the propaganda machine can definitely be used against the people, but I think they kind of shot themselves in the foot with that, because people are starting to see what the mainstream lying media really is, and that's just a megaphone for the New World Order.
[01:03:16.909 --> 01:03:17.509]  Absolutely.
[01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:18.670]  We love you, brother.
[01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:20.011]  Keep spreading the word, North Dakota.
[01:03:20.031 --> 01:03:20.471]  We love you.
[01:03:21.032 --> 01:03:21.972]  Let's talk to Sabrina.
[01:03:23.325 --> 01:03:23.965]  California.
[01:03:23.985 --> 01:03:24.886]  Go ahead, Sabrina.
[01:03:25.486 --> 01:03:26.427]  Hi, Alex.
[01:03:26.727 --> 01:03:27.667]  Hi, how are you?
[01:03:28.268 --> 01:03:29.088]  I'm great talking to you.
[01:03:29.128 --> 01:03:30.469]  We're still on air, and that's a big deal.
[01:03:30.529 --> 01:03:31.689]  It's all thanks to you and God.
[01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:39.813]  I'm so grateful for that, because I don't... When you were gone for that week and a half, it was just... I just thought the worst, so I'm so glad you're back.
[01:03:41.014 --> 01:04:03.684]   I just want to say that we would not have a ruling class if people simply just did not obey these unlawful, unethical, and unconstitutional orders, and I don't know how to reach out to To the law enforcement community, because those are the ones that need to really listen to you more, because they're the ones that are going to turn their backs on us.
[01:04:05.085 --> 01:04:15.891]  And I know that because I was married to somebody who, 20 years ago, used to talk about the New World Order all the time, and then he rose up in his department.
[01:04:16.091 --> 01:04:17.431]  I'm not going to name which one.
[01:04:17.491 --> 01:04:18.872]  Very well-known cases.
[01:04:19.993 --> 01:04:21.874]  And he won't even discuss it now.
[01:04:23.288 --> 01:04:24.588]  So he's been brainwashed.
[01:04:25.008 --> 01:04:27.149]  Well, they adapt to surviving.
[01:04:27.189 --> 01:04:32.070]  They believe going along with it will make them okay, but they're going to find out in the end it will destroy them.
[01:04:32.490 --> 01:04:39.331]  I'm so sorry to hear that, but thank God, Sabrina, that you've kept your soul intact, and it's obviously we're not mad at your ex for this.
[01:04:39.371 --> 01:04:40.831]  We just feel very sorry for him right now.
[01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:53.457]   Yeah, I mean, I can tell you firsthand that just the stuff that I know that he has to watch and see, and I think that really Affects these law enforcement officers.
[01:04:53.477 --> 01:04:55.839]  They're just desensitized to everything.
[01:04:55.879 --> 01:04:56.419]  Well, they do.
[01:04:56.479 --> 01:04:58.340]  But I'm not going to tell any personal stories.
[01:04:58.901 --> 01:05:00.942]  But I've not talked about the things they've done to me.
[01:05:00.962 --> 01:05:02.463]  And I'm not a victim.
[01:05:02.483 --> 01:05:03.183]  I'm an overcomer.
[01:05:03.223 --> 01:05:12.389]  But I have been to the point where the system has said that we'll stop this.
[01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:13.370]  I'm not talking about lawsuits.
[01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:13.870]  That's nothing.
[01:05:14.511 --> 01:05:17.653]  But things with my family, if you'll just won't do this.
[01:05:19.537 --> 01:05:23.621]  They don't kill you, they kill members of your family.
[01:05:25.122 --> 01:05:29.266]  And some people know that we've definitely stayed the course, and they know that.
[01:05:29.466 --> 01:05:30.828]  So that's why they're really scared.
[01:05:31.128 --> 01:05:31.789]  They're scared of you.
[01:05:32.329 --> 01:05:34.191]  And I appreciate you, and I love you, and I appreciate you.
[01:05:35.252 --> 01:05:35.873]  Thank you, Sabrina.
[01:05:36.994 --> 01:05:38.435]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:05:38.455 --> 01:05:40.076]  Let's talk to a caller in Arizona.
[01:05:40.857 --> 01:05:41.698]  Betty, you're on the air.
[01:05:41.758 --> 01:05:42.499]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:05:43.191 --> 01:05:49.953]  Hey Alex, you're big on talking about the straw man and teaching people about false flags and how they misidentify.
[01:05:50.393 --> 01:05:59.856]  But as a history buff, kind of like yourself, it's important to go back to the original straw man, which in our country became the birth certificate.
[01:06:00.677 --> 01:06:07.459]  And we were all bonded and insured and sold into slavery unbeknownst with these birth certificates.
[01:06:07.899 --> 01:06:26.539]   And unless we claim dominion, With these banksters who keep their secret off-book accounts on our bodies and sell us and wheel and deal us in Wall Street under the form of treasury bonds, we can't take dominion back over those who seek to destroy us.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:31.624]  And the way to do something positive is to study this.
[01:06:32.065 --> 01:06:34.527]  Check out the different... Change your status!
[01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:41.113]  We have different statuses under the State Department that have immunity against a lot of these strange things.
[01:06:41.174 --> 01:06:41.814]  Statutes.
[01:06:42.414 --> 01:06:43.115]  Mandates.
[01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:47.637]  And people are not aware of it because they haven't studied the history.
[01:06:48.038 --> 01:06:51.980]  And they don't really give you information you need to make the proper choice.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:58.604]  Well, Betty, there's no doubt that we're going under admiralty law and administrative law and the system just does whatever the hell it wants.
[01:06:59.144 --> 01:07:02.687]  I've experienced that in battling these people.
[01:07:02.707 --> 01:07:04.808]  They've already removed the law.
[01:07:06.067 --> 01:07:07.968]  They've already brought us to an absolute tyranny.
[01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:11.171]  And now they're preparing to execute that tyranny.
[01:07:11.191 --> 01:07:11.671]  Thank you, buddy.
[01:07:12.492 --> 01:07:12.792]  All right.
[01:07:15.054 --> 01:07:15.715]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:07:17.016 --> 01:07:26.343]  We're gonna come back with Mark and Don and Mike and Brian and Coco and Vinny and many other callers in the order they received.
[01:07:26.383 --> 01:07:27.424]  And I love these calls.
[01:07:28.344 --> 01:07:30.226]  I'm giving each caller a minute and a half so we get to everybody.
[01:07:31.257 --> 01:07:35.258]  I think everybody likes that fact I've been doing that, so no disrespect when I hang up on you.
[01:07:35.778 --> 01:07:36.639]  Gotta get to everybody.
[01:07:37.159 --> 01:07:39.979]  We'll be right back doing the verboten forbidden thing.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:45.281]  Humans that love God and justice and freedom and a good future speaking together.
[01:07:46.281 --> 01:07:46.801]  It's beautiful.
[01:07:47.722 --> 01:07:48.282]  We'll be right back.
[01:07:48.102 --> 01:07:49.102]  Stay with us.
[01:07:49.102 --> 01:07:50.102]  [Music]
[01:07:50.102 --> 01:07:51.102]  You say you want to go to a place.
[01:07:51.102 --> 01:07:52.102]  You say that you want to go to a land that's far away.
[01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:53.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:54.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:07:54.102 --> 01:07:55.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:07:55.102 --> 01:07:56.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:07:56.102 --> 01:07:57.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:07:57.102 --> 01:07:58.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:07:58.102 --> 01:07:59.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:07:59.102 --> 01:08:00.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:08:00.102 --> 01:08:01.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:08:01.102 --> 01:08:02.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:08:02.102 --> 01:08:03.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:08:03.102 --> 01:08:04.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:08:04.102 --> 01:08:23.102]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:08:23.102 --> 01:08:34.662]  I want to go to a place that's far away.
[01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:53.104]  And now they're injecting six-month-old babies with their poison.
[01:08:53.124 --> 01:08:59.229]  I have a stack of mainstream news admitting it erases your immune system and causes blood clots.
[01:09:01.071 --> 01:09:02.072]  And doesn't protect you.
[01:09:03.900 --> 01:09:06.442]  And national polls show the vast majority of Americans know that.
[01:09:07.023 --> 01:09:08.925]  So we're winning the fight.
[01:09:09.785 --> 01:09:11.467]  But they've already killed millions of people.
[01:09:12.608 --> 01:09:16.591]  They're preparing new bioweapon releases that are far worse than what we just saw.
[01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:21.115]  We just lived the beta test.
[01:09:23.598 --> 01:09:25.059]  Now our enemies are going operational.
[01:09:29.824 --> 01:09:31.145]  But God is in control.
[01:09:32.006 --> 01:09:33.547]  And God is holding our hand.
[01:09:34.108 --> 01:09:36.950]  God has his hand on our shoulder with guardian angels.
[01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:38.251]  And it's so real.
[01:09:38.271 --> 01:09:42.035]  And I've been through so much and experienced so much that I can't even tell you all about it.
[01:09:42.475 --> 01:09:44.817]  Because we don't give the enemy any operational information.
[01:09:44.857 --> 01:09:46.259]  But just let me explain something.
[01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:48.000]  This is 100% real.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.062]  And you don't need me to tell you that anymore.
[01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:51.063]  You've seen it for yourself.
[01:09:52.284 --> 01:10:01.966]  So thank you for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast that is literally in defiance to everything these parasites and these psychopaths and these demons are doing.
[01:10:03.446 --> 01:10:04.146]  It's a real blessing.
[01:10:05.186 --> 01:10:06.507]  I'm exactly where I want to be.
[01:10:07.867 --> 01:10:13.788]  I've just got to turn it loose and give it to God and stop getting so upset to see their operations because in the end they will fail.
[01:10:14.968 --> 01:10:19.709]  I give it to God here on air and ask God to bring me to the high place that King David talked about.
[01:10:24.121 --> 01:10:26.460]  applied place the most high.
[01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:31.300]   And the lead got to direct me so that I can continue this operation
[01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:35.640]   because we have been given nothing but success, nothing but victory.
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.640]  It has been spectacular.
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:45.000]   And you, the viewers and listeners, you did this, and that's why when I salute you,
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:52.181]   I'm not into self-harming, but I just archetypally want to take
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:59.280]   this dagger and just cut a finger off right on air to show you how much I appreciate you
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.681]  and what you've done.
[01:11:00.681 --> 01:11:04.860]  'Cause giving up a finger to beat these people's nothing.
[01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:09.621]  You have changed the world.
[01:11:09.621 --> 01:11:14.199]  You have stood up against evil.
[01:11:14.199 --> 01:11:16.501]  You have turned the tide.
[01:11:16.501 --> 01:11:19.699]  And I salute you, and I thank you.
[01:11:19.699 --> 01:11:24.541]  You've got that from the very bottom of my heart.
[01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:27.041]  You've got my full commitment.
[01:11:26.653 --> 01:11:28.394]  Because you need to know in the universe they're real people.
[01:11:28.714 --> 01:11:32.195]  You need to know in the universe there's people like you who aren't evil, who don't serve Satan.
[01:11:33.136 --> 01:11:34.876]  That's why they all day say I'm an actor.
[01:11:35.056 --> 01:11:36.237]  All day say I'm a fake.
[01:11:36.617 --> 01:11:38.358]  All day say I'm a fraud with no evidence.
[01:11:39.178 --> 01:11:41.519]  Because they know I didn't sell out to them.
[01:11:42.019 --> 01:11:44.120]  They know you didn't sell out to them.
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:45.280]  They know.
[01:11:48.101 --> 01:11:50.022]  But I'm not going to cut my finger off to prove that.
[01:11:50.703 --> 01:11:51.323]  You don't want me to.
[01:11:52.978 --> 01:11:54.719]  But I will cut down the enemy.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:12:00.001]  I will resist the globalists, and I will continue to do it.
[01:12:00.442 --> 01:12:09.946]  And I just pray for providence and manifest destiny of God's plan, and I pray you join me in that prayer.
[01:12:09.966 --> 01:12:14.449]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:16.990]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:12:18.931 --> 01:12:20.592]  Who has been holding the longest?
[01:12:22.096 --> 01:12:24.037]  Let's talk to Don in New York State.
[01:12:24.057 --> 01:12:24.977]  You're on the air, welcome.
[01:12:26.598 --> 01:12:27.499]  Yes, are you there?
[01:12:27.939 --> 01:12:28.739]  I am, brother, welcome.
[01:12:29.880 --> 01:12:32.721]  Yes, sir, and it's a pleasure and a privilege to talk to you.
[01:12:32.741 --> 01:12:33.902]  I've been listening for years.
[01:12:34.462 --> 01:12:37.624]  I didn't used to know if you were right, but now I do, sadly.
[01:12:38.404 --> 01:12:47.008]  Listen, the one reason I called, you know, the New World Order and the Great Reset and all of that, I don't know if it's possible, but I'm a very country person.
[01:12:47.028 --> 01:12:48.629]  I'm in the northern part of the state.
[01:12:49.369 --> 01:12:52.791]  Great Adirondack Mountains, biggest wilderness east of the Mississippi.
[01:12:52.811 --> 01:12:54.192]  Yeah, what a gorgeous... I've been there.
[01:12:54.212 --> 01:12:55.513]  What a gorgeous place you live in.
[01:12:56.673 --> 01:12:57.234]  Thank you, sir.
[01:12:57.714 --> 01:12:58.474]  I think so, too.
[01:12:58.975 --> 01:13:01.456]  Well, I think I want to try to leave these people behind.
[01:13:01.536 --> 01:13:12.182]  My buddies and I, we're planning to make our own ammo, we'll mold our own lead for bullets, and we're going to make our own black powder, and we're going to try... No, that's great you're doing that, but your real problem is going to be food.
[01:13:13.483 --> 01:13:13.923]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:13.963 --> 01:13:19.360]   Well, hunting fish, and heirloom crops if we can get them and hope that they
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:24.841]   leave us alone will be all right and I don't know but I wanted to throw that in also to say that I have vacuum
[01:13:24.841 --> 01:13:30.039]   tube radio equipment hoping it will withstand an EMS attack.
[01:13:30.039 --> 01:13:34.680]   No, I think that's great and I just think spend half your time getting ready the other half waking
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:38.770]   people up which I'm sure you're doing you're calling in to talk radio right now brother we love
[01:13:38.770 --> 01:13:39.000]  that.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.881]   Yes sir and not only that I got a diesel generator that's got old-time
[01:13:43.881 --> 01:13:47.800]   injection it's non-electronic and I'm hoping that that keeps running
[01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:52.520]   then we may be able to do a little listening and also some talking hem operator.
[01:13:52.752 --> 01:13:53.412]  Beautiful, Don.
[01:13:53.432 --> 01:13:53.992]  We love you.
[01:13:54.633 --> 01:13:56.494]  Let's go to Coco in Michigan.
[01:13:56.554 --> 01:13:57.595]  Coco, you're on the air.
[01:13:57.635 --> 01:13:57.955]  Welcome.
[01:13:59.356 --> 01:13:59.597]  Hi.
[01:13:59.757 --> 01:14:00.998]  Thank you for everything.
[01:14:01.058 --> 01:14:02.319]  Thank you for being on the air.
[01:14:02.359 --> 01:14:05.041]  Thank you for being so strong and so courageous.
[01:14:05.061 --> 01:14:05.281]  Thank you.
[01:14:05.301 --> 01:14:05.981]  And your family.
[01:14:06.001 --> 01:14:06.822]  Thank you.
[01:14:07.482 --> 01:14:09.584]  So, I did want to mention two things.
[01:14:10.559 --> 01:14:17.362]  So, my new response when anyone asks me to wear a mask, which I obviously will not, is, what do you mean?
[01:14:18.062 --> 01:14:19.222]  I am a mask.
[01:14:19.643 --> 01:14:23.624]  I identify as a mask, and I find you to be highly offensive.
[01:14:23.824 --> 01:14:24.244]  Exactly!
[01:14:24.284 --> 01:14:26.425]  They arrest people all the time as posing as cops!
[01:14:26.725 --> 01:14:29.126]  Why do they identify as a cop?
[01:14:29.206 --> 01:14:29.847]  There you go.
[01:14:29.987 --> 01:14:31.227]  I identify as a mask.
[01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:32.448]  There you go.
[01:14:33.048 --> 01:14:39.078]   Second, I wanted to say, you asked specifically, How does it feel to be alive during this?
[01:14:39.278 --> 01:14:46.122]  And I will say that thanks to you and Dr. Zelenko, it feels absolutely amazing, a gift, and a blessing.
[01:14:46.142 --> 01:14:48.323]  So thank you for that.
[01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:49.604]  Couldn't find a better hill to die on.
[01:14:49.624 --> 01:14:50.224]  Well, you're right, Coco.
[01:14:50.244 --> 01:14:53.625]  As bad as this is, it's a blessing to know the truth and know where you are in history.
[01:14:54.646 --> 01:14:58.568]  And couldn't find a better hill to die on than the freedoms of this country.
[01:14:58.948 --> 01:15:02.750]  There's a reason we're here now, and it's beautiful.
[01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:04.671]  What do you think is coming, Coco?
[01:15:06.582 --> 01:15:09.064]  I think, well, everything you guys say.
[01:15:09.124 --> 01:15:10.886]  I mean, I've done my own research.
[01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:12.767]  I've done quite a bit of research.
[01:15:13.608 --> 01:15:16.811]  And I do believe the famine.
[01:15:16.911 --> 01:15:27.780]  I honestly don't think that... I think that I am so fortunate that this is my hill to die on.
[01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.021]  I feel that that is...
[01:15:29.617 --> 01:15:31.958]  Oh yeah, we're gonna die on it one way or the other.
[01:15:32.018 --> 01:15:32.859]  They're coming to kill us.
[01:15:32.919 --> 01:15:33.419]  Exactly.
[01:15:33.839 --> 01:15:34.839]  All they can do is fight back.
[01:15:34.899 --> 01:15:35.900]  God bless you Coco.
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.141]  Let's take a caller now from Washington State.
[01:15:39.602 --> 01:15:41.062]  Brian on the West Coast.
[01:15:41.182 --> 01:15:41.983]  Thank you for calling.
[01:15:44.444 --> 01:15:44.944]  Hey Alex.
[01:15:45.464 --> 01:15:46.064]  Good to talk to you.
[01:15:47.505 --> 01:15:48.546]  So, can you hear me okay?
[01:15:49.066 --> 01:15:50.026]  Yes sir, thanks for calling.
[01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:52.287]  Okay Alex, I've told Owen this too.
[01:15:54.472 --> 01:16:08.524]  And I just want to say, man, being able to listen to your show and some of your guests that you have on and some of these people that are so influential in educating people on the mRNA vaccines and understanding our immune system.
[01:16:08.564 --> 01:16:09.504]  I mean, it's so powerful.
[01:16:09.524 --> 01:16:13.868]  I like to liken you to like a modern day John the Baptist, right?
[01:16:14.549 --> 01:16:21.114]  I mean, our society is totally collapsing and you and your guests are putting up such powerful information.
[01:16:21.713 --> 01:16:23.854]  On how to protect ourselves and protect our families.
[01:16:23.874 --> 01:16:27.375]  It's Sunday shows for me.
[01:16:27.655 --> 01:16:29.416]  It really helps me ground myself.
[01:16:29.896 --> 01:16:31.317]  Me too.
[01:16:31.377 --> 01:16:35.198]  The listeners, the callers, the guests, we're in the same boat, brother.
[01:16:35.218 --> 01:16:38.079]  The thing is, they want us to think we're alone.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:38.900]  We're not alone.
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.421]  Actually, almost a majority of people are with us.
[01:16:42.461 --> 01:16:44.102]  We just don't have a way to connect.
[01:16:45.339 --> 01:16:46.720]  Right, right, exactly.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:17:04.209]  You know, you asked this question last week or so about what's the next step that these transgender, basically the sex offenders, what direction do they want to go with our kids, like run around naked in front of kids at these parades and things.
[01:17:04.784 --> 01:17:22.406]  I think the next step is actually, you look at these other countries that these globalist, corporate global operations have taken control of, I think they're going to push it to, I mean as far as all the chaos that we already see, I think the next step with kids is pushing them into child prostitution and having that be open and normalized.
[01:17:23.447 --> 01:17:23.628]  Right?
[01:17:25.472 --> 01:17:26.392]  No, I think you're right.
[01:17:26.472 --> 01:17:27.573]  I mean, I mean, I mean, that's it.
[01:17:27.613 --> 01:17:33.894]  They teach in the public schools in fifth grade and sixth grade that the sex worker is what you should be.
[01:17:33.934 --> 01:17:35.015]  We're not attacking sex workers.
[01:17:35.335 --> 01:17:37.496]  We're trying to put them into that highly abusive situation.
[01:17:37.836 --> 01:17:38.596]  Ryan, I love you.
[01:17:39.036 --> 01:17:42.397]  Mike, Lee, Gilbert, Vinny, Mark, I'm getting all your calls.
[01:17:44.063 --> 01:17:51.234]  The system loves to throw it in our face.
[01:17:51.876 --> 01:17:58.876]   In the mid-1990s, The Simpsons told us what was coming and the new COVID lockdowns are about to be announced.
[01:17:58.876 --> 01:18:06.876]   I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[01:18:07.604 --> 01:18:15.671]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong in dark rooms, glued to their televisions, too terrified to skip the commercials.
[01:18:16.111 --> 01:18:19.695]  Well, I think... NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:23.018]  I think we should go with the good old-fashioned public health care.
[01:18:23.278 --> 01:18:23.398]  Yeah.
[01:18:24.813 --> 01:18:25.454]  A new disease.
[01:18:25.714 --> 01:18:26.334]  No one's immune.
[01:18:26.654 --> 01:18:29.917]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.
[01:18:30.117 --> 01:18:31.798]  And instead of summer, it's all the time!
[01:18:32.479 --> 01:18:36.702]  Now I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[01:18:36.722 --> 01:18:38.283]  He loves being that guy.
[01:18:38.363 --> 01:18:40.805]  But Janice, we do have standards.
[01:18:41.025 --> 01:18:42.726]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[01:18:42.986 --> 01:18:47.289]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:50.932]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.
[01:18:51.252 --> 01:18:51.993]  Get over here, NBC.
[01:18:54.314 --> 01:18:57.676]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I... Oh.
[01:19:00.197 --> 01:19:00.457]  Wow.
[01:19:01.158 --> 01:19:01.438]  Wow.
[01:19:01.718 --> 01:19:02.338]  Oh, yeah.
[01:19:02.579 --> 01:19:04.360]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.002]  Now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household.
[01:19:09.222 --> 01:19:11.623]  Something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[01:19:12.004 --> 01:19:14.305]  House Cat Flu is coming, people.
[01:19:14.505 --> 01:19:21.889]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the House Cat Flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[01:19:23.469 --> 01:19:33.739]   So petter beware, that warm body on your lap just might be be ready to destroy your tender vittles.
[01:19:34.739 --> 01:19:38.949]   Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information if they experience any of the following
[01:19:38.949 --> 01:19:39.739]  symptoms.
[01:19:40.634 --> 01:19:43.635]  Mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night.
[01:19:44.835 --> 01:19:46.996]  So we sit here calmly talking about this.
[01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:57.496]   Millions of Six-month-olds are being injected by their brainwashed parents with something that erases their immune system, implants cancer-causing prions in their body.
[01:19:58.537 --> 01:19:59.257]  That's the year, 2022.
[01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:01.238]  That's just where we are.
[01:20:01.618 --> 01:20:04.480]  They think you're too weak-minded, or I'm too weak-minded to face it.
[01:20:04.540 --> 01:20:05.020]  No, we're not.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.521]  They'll be brought to justice.
[01:20:07.421 --> 01:20:09.762]  All right, we're taking your phone calls right now.
[01:20:10.883 --> 01:20:16.072]   And the caller I was about to go to Dustin in Florida is there.
[01:20:16.232 --> 01:20:21.676]  Dustin in Florida, truck driver, says people don't understand what's going on, but you see it in the supply chain.
[01:20:21.696 --> 01:20:22.396]  Tell us what you're seeing.
[01:20:23.997 --> 01:20:36.826]  Yeah, I just want to say I believe you will go down as one of the most important people in history, and people just don't understand the caliber of what's happening right now until it's right in our face.
[01:20:37.306 --> 01:20:41.348]  And it's just so important to try to get the word out there.
[01:20:41.368 --> 01:20:42.289]  I drive trucks.
[01:20:42.653 --> 01:20:47.213]   I ride it on the side of my truck, I got a flag, you know, we have to wait.
[01:20:47.213 --> 01:20:52.252]   As many people up, I got a Bluetooth speaker, I go into the truck stop with an episode of
[01:20:52.252 --> 01:20:56.972]   "New Plane." Every time I go into the truck stop trying to wake people up,
[01:20:56.972 --> 01:20:59.932]   all I can do is put the information out there, hopefully they listen,
[01:20:59.932 --> 01:21:05.851]   and I give out the website everywhere I go. By the way, Dustin, it's not all you're doing.
[01:21:05.851 --> 01:21:11.851]   Grassroots communication is the most powerful form if small people, you're not small,
[01:21:11.851 --> 01:21:17.613]   but that's how they see you. Activate and spread the word, it's a chain reaction, nothing can stop you.
[01:21:17.788 --> 01:21:18.368]  Absolutely.
[01:21:18.828 --> 01:21:22.409]  And only humans have ingrained in them, hey, hey, pssh, pass it on.
[01:21:22.729 --> 01:21:32.752]  We haven't ingrained, you gotta say, hey, it's forbidden, here it is, and then tell others, and then they do it, and people innately already know that, even if they're unconscious, it activates something, you understand?
[01:21:34.192 --> 01:21:46.695]  Absolutely, yes, and people really do, when they hear your voice, they go, hey, isn't that, and I go, yeah, Alex Jones, listen to him, and he is on point, knows what he's talking about, he needs to be protected at all costs.
[01:21:47.734 --> 01:21:50.296]  He will go down as one of the most important people in America.
[01:21:50.336 --> 01:21:53.879]  Well, brother, I appreciate that, but protect this transmission at all costs.
[01:21:54.339 --> 01:21:57.482]  I don't care what happens to me, but I am wracked with trying to keep us on air.
[01:21:57.802 --> 01:21:59.203]  We are so close to being shut down.
[01:21:59.543 --> 01:22:00.644]  So thank you for your word of mouth.
[01:22:00.804 --> 01:22:01.725]  God bless you, Dustin.
[01:22:02.185 --> 01:22:03.246]  Call me back again this week.
[01:22:03.526 --> 01:22:04.026]  I love you.
[01:22:04.427 --> 01:22:05.448]  All right, gotta get to everybody here.
[01:22:05.488 --> 01:22:07.329]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:10.111]  Mark in Illinois on the Georgia Guidestones.
[01:22:10.131 --> 01:22:11.172]  I got blown up Monday.
[01:22:11.192 --> 01:22:11.492]  Go ahead.
[01:22:12.873 --> 01:22:13.794]  Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:22:13.834 --> 01:22:14.555]  It's a real honor.
[01:22:14.755 --> 01:22:15.715]  I want to go real fast.
[01:22:16.846 --> 01:22:22.148]  If you watch the video of the Georgia Guidestones exploding, they say 4 a.m., but it's more specific.
[01:22:22.688 --> 01:22:24.328]  The clock on the camera says 4-0-3-33.
[01:22:24.488 --> 01:22:27.869]  And I don't think that's a mistake.
[01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:29.710]  I don't think that's a mistake.
[01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:32.571]  I think they're taking down the first B system to install the next.
[01:22:33.071 --> 01:22:34.131]  But I'll leave that right there.
[01:22:34.671 --> 01:22:40.453]  What I really wanted to say was, this could be the most important message from a caller you've ever had.
[01:22:41.533 --> 01:22:49.975]   Every single listener right now Needs to stop spending money at big tech, streaming services, entertainment, and especially their cable bills.
[01:22:50.515 --> 01:22:51.196]  Cancel them.
[01:22:51.516 --> 01:22:51.816]  Now.
[01:22:52.356 --> 01:22:56.138]  Take 20% of the money you just saved and make a recurring donation.
[01:22:56.458 --> 01:22:57.559]  We're past buying products.
[01:22:57.679 --> 01:22:58.259]  Buy the products?
[01:22:58.419 --> 01:22:58.820]  Absolutely.
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:22:59.920]  I have every single one of them.
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.461]  Everybody needs to make a donation right now.
[01:23:02.942 --> 01:23:05.103]  You once said, that's the real power.
[01:23:05.323 --> 01:23:05.723]  Attack.
[01:23:06.143 --> 01:23:08.164]  Followed by one of your infamous battle cries.
[01:23:08.785 --> 01:23:10.185]  Well, I'm going to change it a little bit.
[01:23:10.626 --> 01:23:11.946]  Donating to the info war.
[01:23:12.346 --> 01:23:13.307]  That's the real power.
[01:23:14.625 --> 01:23:19.388]  Brother, I totally agree with you and you got to go to Infowarshore.com and do the support thing and find the link.
[01:23:19.728 --> 01:23:28.032]  We're going to start adding the donate link under every live show feed because I swear on my children, we're totally maxed out and we are so close to being shut down or imploding.
[01:23:28.333 --> 01:23:30.094]  So God bless you and I appreciate you, brother.
[01:23:30.114 --> 01:23:30.814]  Anything else, Mark?
[01:23:32.455 --> 01:23:33.035]  That's it, Alex.
[01:23:33.075 --> 01:23:34.216]  Thanks so much for what you're doing.
[01:23:34.256 --> 01:23:35.136]  Keep up the great work.
[01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.117]  You are the tip of the spear.
[01:23:37.196 --> 01:23:37.696]  Thank you, sir.
[01:23:37.736 --> 01:23:39.176]  I try to be... I'll just say this.
[01:23:40.037 --> 01:23:48.598]  May God strike me down if I'm not absolutely totally maxed out and have not spent almost all the funds I've got.
[01:23:48.959 --> 01:23:50.219]  I barely have any backup funds.
[01:23:50.259 --> 01:23:50.939]  And I'm not bitching.
[01:23:51.239 --> 01:23:51.999]  I believe in God.
[01:23:52.279 --> 01:23:52.959]  I know God's real.
[01:23:52.999 --> 01:23:54.540]  And maybe I'm supposed to be taken out of the fight right now.
[01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:55.720]  But I need support.
[01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:56.940]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:57.920]  You need support.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:58.361]  We love you.
[01:23:58.401 --> 01:23:59.081]  We appreciate you.
[01:24:00.401 --> 01:24:03.322]  Let's go to Lee in Pennsylvania is next up.
[01:24:03.402 --> 01:24:04.142]  Lee, thanks for holding.
[01:24:04.462 --> 01:24:04.862]  Go ahead, Lee.
[01:24:06.769 --> 01:24:07.890]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:08.050 --> 01:24:08.570]  Love your show.
[01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:09.731]  Good to finally talk to you.
[01:24:09.991 --> 01:24:10.331]  Yes, sir.
[01:24:10.372 --> 01:24:10.732]  Thank you.
[01:24:12.673 --> 01:24:19.218]  I wanted to talk to you about, whenever you were on Blair White's podcast, I remember you saying that you felt really white-pilled about the future.
[01:24:19.738 --> 01:24:26.843]  But on your show on July 7th, you seemed rather, you know, not so happy, not so looking forward to what's coming.
[01:24:27.243 --> 01:24:31.706]  You were saying that sometimes we may not have 10 more years, even.
[01:24:31.726 --> 01:24:38.073]   So I was just wondering, like, right now, how much your overall That's a great question.
[01:24:38.113 --> 01:24:40.914]  You know, I don't get orders from anybody except God.
[01:24:40.934 --> 01:24:43.454]  And I feel optimistic some days.
[01:24:43.514 --> 01:24:44.354]  I don't other days.
[01:24:44.374 --> 01:24:45.875]  Because we're winning overall.
[01:24:45.935 --> 01:24:46.695]  People are waking up.
[01:24:47.175 --> 01:24:49.195]  And so, in the end, I feel white-pilled.
[01:24:49.555 --> 01:24:50.796]  Currently, I feel black-pilled.
[01:24:50.896 --> 01:24:51.596]  Very desperate.
[01:24:51.916 --> 01:24:54.936]  So I think currently, the flesh feels black-pilled.
[01:24:55.536 --> 01:24:56.837]  The spirit feels white-pilled.
[01:24:56.857 --> 01:24:57.477]  Does that make sense?
[01:24:57.497 --> 01:24:59.757]  Oh, it makes total sense.
[01:24:59.817 --> 01:25:01.697]  I mean, I always go back and forth.
[01:25:01.757 --> 01:25:04.018]  I mean, I always try to stay white-pilled.
[01:25:05.239 --> 01:25:08.241]  I've listened to you, I've really thought about God a lot more and stuff like that.
[01:25:08.261 --> 01:25:24.228]  The only other thing I wanted to ask you about was, you know, I'm in my early 20s, I have a girlfriend I want to get married to in a couple years, but hearing about all this control and how globalists come after people you love, I'm just curious, like, what do you think, for someone in my shoes right now, is the best course of action?
[01:25:24.949 --> 01:25:33.233]  Brother, keep loving, get a wife, have children, bet on life, that's the biggest double down there is, and just don't give up.
[01:25:33.965 --> 01:25:35.106]  Don't let them shut you down.
[01:25:35.526 --> 01:25:37.508]  Don't make them let you become depressed.
[01:25:37.528 --> 01:25:39.269]  When I tell you that, I'm giving myself that advice.
[01:25:39.289 --> 01:25:43.052]  When I point my finger at you, Lee, it's back at me three fingers.
[01:25:43.092 --> 01:25:45.634]  Man, I have just got to realize it's God's plan.
[01:25:45.994 --> 01:25:47.175]  It's a larger operation.
[01:25:47.295 --> 01:25:48.476]  I've just got to be a good person.
[01:25:48.496 --> 01:25:49.777]  Fight as hard as I can.
[01:25:49.817 --> 01:25:50.438]  I appreciate you.
[01:25:50.478 --> 01:25:50.998]  God bless you.
[01:25:51.538 --> 01:25:52.319]  Incredible calls.
[01:25:52.379 --> 01:25:53.440]  These are incredible calls.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:54.180]  Just incredible.
[01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:55.642]  I feel so bad.
[01:25:55.662 --> 01:26:01.126]  We got three minutes left and we got like a bunch of calls left, but I'll go to the order they received.
[01:26:01.186 --> 01:26:01.966]  Mike in Colorado.
[01:26:01.986 --> 01:26:02.527]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:26:03.911 --> 01:26:06.293]  Yeah, hey Alex, a pleasure to speak with you.
[01:26:06.313 --> 01:26:07.674]  This is great.
[01:26:08.054 --> 01:26:18.762]  I'm a legal immigrant from 1970s Poland and I know exactly what it means to have one tank of gas a month when you're given a coupon from the government.
[01:26:19.663 --> 01:26:24.927]  And in fact, I remember my uncle siphoning gas out of his car to get us out.
[01:26:25.227 --> 01:26:26.948]  And again, you're from Poland, it's on record.
[01:26:26.988 --> 01:26:28.649]  They used it to control you.
[01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:30.711]  How great the Polish people are.
[01:26:31.051 --> 01:26:32.132]  How much they love freedom.
[01:26:33.268 --> 01:26:33.889]  Exactly.
[01:26:34.329 --> 01:26:34.849]  Exactly.
[01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:39.193]  And I first heard you on 9-11 and a buddy of mine was like, listen to this guy.
[01:26:39.233 --> 01:26:40.995]  He's got a different point of view.
[01:26:41.095 --> 01:26:42.396]  And it's very, very interesting.
[01:26:42.416 --> 01:26:43.557]  And I've been listening ever since.
[01:26:44.197 --> 01:26:45.639]  This is my first call.
[01:26:46.319 --> 01:26:51.624]  And, you know, fast forward a few decades and I'm in a global fuel logistics company.
[01:26:52.284 --> 01:26:59.931]  And it's amazing to see the shortages that are coming with distribution of jet fuel and fuel for ships.
[01:27:00.935 --> 01:27:06.916]  We used to get some messages that, you know, there would be restrictions, you know, after hurricanes.
[01:27:06.996 --> 01:27:09.217]  And now it's like, it's coming in weekly.
[01:27:09.677 --> 01:27:19.898]  And if you think there's delays bad right now with airlines and other logistics, I think it's going to get a lot worse, unfortunately.
[01:27:20.158 --> 01:27:20.999]  Mike, I love you.
[01:27:21.439 --> 01:27:22.359]  And I appreciate you.
[01:27:22.479 --> 01:27:23.479]  And I said I'd do it.
[01:27:23.519 --> 01:27:24.019]  We've been busy.
[01:27:24.039 --> 01:27:24.419]  I haven't done it.
