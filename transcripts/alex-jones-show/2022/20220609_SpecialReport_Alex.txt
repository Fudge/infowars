[00:00:00.305 --> 00:00:01.606]  We're living in critical times.
[00:00:02.346 --> 00:00:08.649]  We're living in historic times, but I can tell you that while I'm on the road, the public is even more awake than they've ever been.
[00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:18.514]  Black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, you name it, I have been mobbed while I've been on the road on this business trip here on the West Coast.
[00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:24.237]  And it has been just very, very heartening to see this happen.
[00:00:24.697 --> 00:00:30.508]   Almost everybody I talk to says, Hey, because the mainstream media attacked you and demonized you.
[00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:36.211]  I went to check out who you were in the last few years and research what you were saying and found out it was true.
[00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:38.193]  And now I'm telling everybody else about the broadcast.
[00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:45.897]  They said, when the system is so corrupt and so evil and they're attacking somebody, we know you must be good.
[00:00:46.317 --> 00:00:48.219]  And then we went and checked you out and found out you were.
[00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.941]  So the good news is people are really waking up.
[00:00:51.981 --> 00:00:55.383]  The bad news is the globalists know that and they're making their move right now.
[00:00:56.374 --> 00:01:07.610]  Now that said, they have a plan to slowly cut off the food and the energy, we're already deep into that operation, to bring people to their knees so they can bring in their Great Reset and their Build Back Better program.
[00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:16.201]   That's why we've got to continue to expose their agenda and that it's the Dabos Group and the Globalists We need to accept that there will be some pain in the process.
[00:01:16.021 --> 00:01:18.620]  and sell the next leg of their operation.
[00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:25.021]   We have to reinforce our resilience against a new virus possibly
[00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:28.221]  or other risks which we have on the global agenda.
[00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:32.621]   We need to accept that there will be some pain in the process.
[00:01:32.621 --> 00:01:36.621]   I think we're going to have to think about a recalibration of a whole range of human rights
[00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:37.820]  that are playing out online.
[00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.420]  The future is not just happening.
[00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.420]  The future is built by us.
[00:01:42.473 --> 00:01:46.976]  Through technology and ability for consumers to measure their own carbon footprint.
[00:01:47.236 --> 00:01:50.078]  Many of these things will be built directly into our bodies.
[00:01:50.258 --> 00:01:52.819]  Individual carbon footprint tracker.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.185]  You see every day how the world is falling apart with the different crises which we have to manage.
[00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:08.028]  What is the Granholm plan to increase oil production in America?
[00:02:11.383 --> 00:02:12.063]  It's hilarious.
[00:02:12.423 --> 00:02:22.587]  We accelerate the move to clean energy because ultimately a move to clean energy is the homegrown secure kind of energy that will make us independent.
[00:02:23.027 --> 00:02:29.350]  Inflation has gone up and we must address that because the cost of food and the price of the pump.
[00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:35.439]   The price of the pump is affected by shortages, some of it caused by Putin.
[00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.600]  This is part of, this is Putin's price of the pump.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.681]  Not all of it, but most, much of it.
[00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:46.961]   But the bottom line is that this president and this administration are looking at every single tool
[00:02:46.961 --> 00:02:51.200]   to shield American families from the impact of rising energy prices.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.081]   And we're working through, we're working through an energy transition.
[00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:58.550]  And we've got to start by adding energy.
[00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:04.131]  And the reality is, we have to take some time to get off of oil and gas.
[00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:07.812]  I didn't have enough chips in this country to finally get my electric vehicle.
[00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:16.775]  I got it and drove it from Michigan to here this last weekend and went by every single gas station and it didn't matter how high it was.
[00:03:17.115 --> 00:03:20.457]  The last time you filled your car up with gasoline, do you remember what the price was?
[00:03:22.822 --> 00:03:24.403]  I drive an electric vehicle.
[00:03:26.163 --> 00:03:27.684]  You know what the President Biden this week said?
[00:03:28.144 --> 00:03:36.547]  He didn't learn about the severity of the infant formula shortage until April, but problems first emerged back at the Abbott plant back in October of 2021.
[00:03:37.207 --> 00:03:42.950]  An industry executive said they knew how bad this could get when the plant closed in February.
[00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.330]  You're the Secretary of Commerce.
[00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.651]  When did you first learn of this problem?
[00:03:49.572 --> 00:03:53.114]  I first learned about it, you know, a couple of months ago.
[00:03:53.455 --> 00:03:59.138]  So this is a difficult issue.
[00:03:59.278 --> 00:04:00.499]  Yes, probably April.
[00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:03.821]  I'm not involved in the administration's response here, I should say.
[00:04:03.841 --> 00:04:11.105]  Inflation is really our top economic problem at this point and that it's critical that we address it.
[00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:19.569]   So I do expect inflation to Inflation is a reality and people are struggling with it.
[00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.130]  No one has a crystal ball.
[00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.111]  Anyone who tells you they do, I would question.
[00:04:24.471 --> 00:04:28.032]  The economy is in a better place than it has been historically.
[00:04:28.452 --> 00:04:36.235]  And so we feel here at this administration, and other experts as well, is that we feel that we are in a good position to take on inflation.
[00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:38.176]  Now, everybody knows that.
[00:04:38.976 --> 00:04:40.096]  You don't need me to tell you that.
[00:04:40.216 --> 00:04:44.498]  But the point is, the general public has not completely figured that out yet.
[00:04:44.578 --> 00:04:47.368]   When they do, It's game over for the New World Order.
[00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.891]  Now, here's a really important announcement I want to make.
[00:04:50.852 --> 00:04:53.835]  We've been selling high-quality, storable food for over a decade.
[00:04:54.035 --> 00:05:00.721]  We've been partnered with MyPatriot Supply, the biggest and best fit out there with quality food at the lowest price you're going to find to get quality food.
[00:05:00.761 --> 00:05:08.689]  You can find stuff that's cheaper, but it's not nearly as good, and they almost always make you wait months to get it, and in many cases, you don't even get it.
[00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.691]  With MyPatriot, you get it.
[00:05:11.371 --> 00:05:13.513]  That's because they've got warehouses all over the U.S.
[00:05:13.633 --> 00:05:16.216]  They buy food a year out with their contracts.
[00:05:16.696 --> 00:05:22.882]  They have been pre-positioned to not have to raise prices while everybody else has been having to raise prices.
[00:05:22.902 --> 00:05:25.825]  The last time they raised prices was just a little bit a year ago.
[00:05:26.526 --> 00:05:31.631]  They are going to have to raise prices soon because the inflation, as you know, and the food shortages are accelerating.
[00:05:31.931 --> 00:05:38.005]   But they have Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of quality food items in stock, stockpiled.
[00:05:38.425 --> 00:05:41.968]  And for the next few months, they are going to be able to ship within days.
[00:05:42.468 --> 00:05:48.892]  Current orders coming in to preparetoday.com are shipping within 24 hours.
[00:05:48.952 --> 00:05:51.834]  Unless you order like on a Saturday, then it'll be 48 hours.
[00:05:52.395 --> 00:05:56.217]  Ladies and gentlemen, you need to take action right now.
[00:05:56.457 --> 00:05:58.719]  This funds the operation, but that's secondary.
[00:05:59.429 --> 00:06:11.676]  The system wants you dependent on them and the only way to beat inflation is to buy high quality storable food and other items that you can use in the future that you buy at a lower price today.
[00:06:11.836 --> 00:06:14.077]  So, it's streamlined.
[00:06:14.358 --> 00:06:15.478]  It's all on one site.
[00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:17.119]  They run the whole thing.
[00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:18.620]  It's their entire back end.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.641]  It's their entire spectrum of products.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.721]   hundreds and hundreds of not just high quality, affordable foods, but other preparedness and survival items
[00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:32.920]   at the lowest prices you're going to find because they are able to buy it in bulk
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.979]  and then pass those savings on to you.
[00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:37.680]  So this is a total 360 win.
