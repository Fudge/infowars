[00:00:03.071 --> 00:00:07.013]  It's Monday, July 4th, 2022.
[00:00:07.193 --> 00:00:09.995]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:10.075 --> 00:00:14.638]  I'm extremely honored and blessed to be here with you for this special broadcast.
[00:00:15.278 --> 00:00:22.743]  There was an article that came up on Saturday at InfoWars.com we're going to cover in the next segment that explains it all.
[00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:24.937]  U.S.
[00:00:24.977 --> 00:00:32.442]  under more tyranny now than in 1776, says well-known, respected historian Douglas MacKinnon.
[00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:34.303]  That is coming up next segment.
[00:00:34.683 --> 00:00:37.505]  And that is the whole point of this July 4th broadcast.
[00:00:38.426 --> 00:00:52.795]  If you look at the medical tyranny, and the open borders, the devaluation of currency, and the pedophilia, and the illegal surveillance, and the censorship, and the human-animal cloning, and all of it, it is insane the level of tyranny that we're already living under.
[00:00:54.394 --> 00:01:03.081]  But to defeat the tyranny, we must first identify who they are, what their modus operandi is, what their goal is to be able to stop them.
[00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:08.845]  They are transhumanist, mad scientists using behavioral psychology to control us.
[00:01:09.386 --> 00:01:22.336]  And as soon as you pull up to the 35,000 foot view, or the 100,000 foot view, or the million foot view, you see the whole thing there, and then you know how it all works, and then you have power over it.
[00:01:22.998 --> 00:01:39.951]  But if you just debate this issue or that issue or this attack they're launching, you're fighting heads of the Hydra instead of actually going after the central heart of the matter that's launched that attack.
[00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:41.953]  So that's coming up next segment.
[00:01:42.653 --> 00:01:55.437]   But I got to tell you, to witness the enemies of humanity Holding people hostage, preparing new viruses, preparing new lockdowns, and posing as the saviors.
[00:01:56.218 --> 00:01:58.479]  Well, out of one side of their mouth, they say they're the saviors.
[00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.122]  And out of the other side of their mouth, they admit, we're creating a new world.
[00:02:03.202 --> 00:02:13.708]  We are forcing people to transition, not to some clean energy, Star Trek utopia, but to a dystopic reality.
[00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:16.750]  And that's where we are in the year.
[00:02:17.695 --> 00:02:24.921]  2022.
[00:02:18.256 --> 00:02:24.921]  So everything we do here is about challenging that great lie and saying no to it.
[00:02:24.981 --> 00:02:28.965]  Now, I'll be here for a few segments covering the latest news and developments.
[00:02:29.005 --> 00:02:33.969]  And then we've got a great best of with Dr. Zelenko, who died last Thursday.
[00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.812]  Great patriot, alive with us forever with his thoughts and deeds and actions.
[00:02:37.853 --> 00:02:42.837]  And of course, spiritually, we'll join him at the next level, hopefully, if we are able to make the cut.
[00:02:44.343 --> 00:02:51.148]  But that's coming up today and so much more and I wanted to take a few minutes out before we go to break and come back with all this news is just say this.
[00:02:52.469 --> 00:03:01.135]  I've been on air 28 years and I've had some great crews and some good people, but I got to say the crew we've had the last 3-4 years has been an absolute godsend.
[00:03:02.596 --> 00:03:12.050]   And I want them through that glass right there behind that camera right there to know I love you and I appreciate you and we couldn't have done any of this Without you.
[00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.011]  And if it's the last thing I do, I'm not going to let you down.
[00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:15.992]  You've not let me down.
[00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:20.573]  And I really, really appreciate you.
[00:03:22.354 --> 00:03:29.417]  And thank you for everything you've done and your commitment to professionalism and focus to getting the job done.
[00:03:29.917 --> 00:03:31.157]  You are amazing.
[00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:37.620]  And I just want on this July 4th to declare independence against the New World Order and independence against their whole satanic operation.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.301]  But at the same time, I want to celebrate this crew.
[00:03:41.241 --> 00:03:56.512]  And our listeners, the great activists for Race, Color, and Creed, our affiliates, our sponsors, all of our friends like Joe Rogan, and Tucker Carlson, and President Bolsonaro, and so many others that have supported what we're doing.
[00:03:57.012 --> 00:04:13.509]   This has been an incredible fight, and we've won so many battles together, but now we are coming into focus for the greatest challenge of our lives, and I can tell you, Despite all the persecution and the hell we've been through, it's all been a learning process.
[00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.434]  We couldn't have understood this if God hadn't put us through this.
[00:04:16.935 --> 00:04:20.181]  So above all, I want to thank my Creator.
[00:04:21.072 --> 00:04:36.797]  Respectfully and humbly, for the gift of consciousness, great creator, and thank you for fulfilling our will, millisecond to millisecond, and we praise you, and we thank you, and we ask you to fulfill us and empower us and lead God and direct us in the fights that we have.
[00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:48.541]  We praise you, O great Heavenly Father, and the Son you sent for the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and we just ask you to fulfill us and empower us because we are weak, we are fallen, we are sinners, and we cannot defeat this evil without you.
[00:04:49.713 --> 00:04:53.016]  You are the answer, and we thank you again, and ask you to come into our hearts more now, more than ever.
[00:04:53.817 --> 00:04:55.198]  So again, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:57.500]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:05:01.905 --> 00:05:07.250]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:11.313]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.453]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:16.934]  You might not agree with everything.
[00:05:17.394 --> 00:05:20.496]  You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[00:05:21.217 --> 00:05:23.599]  And there's nowhere else, really, that does it like we do here.
[00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:24.459]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[00:05:24.859 --> 00:05:30.003]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, Infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks.
[00:05:30.083 --> 00:05:31.685]  And we do have the best supplements.
[00:05:31.705 --> 00:05:40.161]   I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, We do the best with our supplements as well.
[00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:42.723]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[00:05:42.883 --> 00:05:44.183]  Folks, this is a joke.
[00:05:44.443 --> 00:05:45.764]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:46.984]  It's 75% off.
[00:05:47.285 --> 00:05:49.646]  By the way, it works for me, in case you haven't noticed.
[00:05:49.866 --> 00:05:53.247]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[00:05:53.747 --> 00:05:55.568]  Quite well, I might add.
[00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:56.789]  Quite well.
[00:05:56.929 --> 00:05:59.950]  My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:01.351]  I go and see him quite often now.
[00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:15.422]   It's July 4th, 2022, and you have found the tip of the July 4th rebellion, living on 240 plus years later, thanks to
[00:06:15.422 --> 00:06:16.211]  you.
[00:06:16.301 --> 00:06:20.284]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:21.685 --> 00:06:26.685]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.685 --> 00:06:31.685]  [MUSIC]
[00:06:31.685 --> 00:06:38.685]   Celebrating our victory 200 plus years ago against the British tyrant King George III.
[00:06:38.986 --> 00:06:51.656]  We are honored and blessed to be with you on this Monday, July 4th, 2022 transmission in defiance to the new world order and everything they've done to try to silence us and muzzle us and shut us down.
[00:06:52.296 --> 00:06:58.882]  I salute down to my last cell, from the bottom of my will to the top of my consciousness.
[00:06:59.602 --> 00:07:03.005]  Thankfulness to all of you for keeping us in the fight.
[00:07:03.245 --> 00:07:09.670]  Incredible job to the listeners, the viewers, the crew, the sponsors, the affiliates, everybody.
[00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:16.395]  The fact that we're in the fight in the world's awakening is a huge victory and we are blessed to be here today with you.
[00:07:18.655 --> 00:07:23.157]  All right, big story up on Infowars.com that came out on July 2nd, Saturday, but I want to cover it now.
[00:07:24.338 --> 00:07:24.638]  U.S.
[00:07:24.698 --> 00:07:28.840]  under more tyranny now than in 1776, says historian.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:40.345]  The far left, unfortunately, has taken control of the major five megaphones of our nation, meaning the media, entertainment, academia, and of late, science and medicine, says Douglas MacKinnon.
[00:07:41.076 --> 00:07:47.396]   United States is experiencing more tyranny presently than it did during the revolutionary period in 1776 according to
[00:07:47.396 --> 00:07:50.076]  an author, historian Douglas MacKinnon.
[00:07:50.076 --> 00:08:00.076]   I read some of his books. In a Fox and Friends interview Saturday, MacKinnon warned that radical Campos Duffy,
[00:08:00.076 --> 00:08:06.076]   that the American true history is no longer being taught in schools.
[00:08:06.493 --> 00:08:09.655]  That America is oppressed by more tyranny now than the year it was founded.
[00:08:10.095 --> 00:08:14.756]  Because of the left's stranglehold on inflation, education, and science centers.
[00:08:15.156 --> 00:08:18.658]  Because the major big banks and the power structure is funding them.
[00:08:18.958 --> 00:08:22.319]  They're not the rebels, they are the establishment.
[00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:36.389]  As bad as the tyranny was in 1776, in many ways it's way worse, worse in 2022, because the far left, unfortunately, is taking control over the five major megaphones of our society.
[00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:38.230]  I don't need to read more of that to you.
[00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:41.572]  We'll play the clip coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:08:41.612 --> 00:08:47.355]  But I explain to you, as I do on a routine basis, and I know you know this team down, wars cost money.
[00:08:48.576 --> 00:08:52.659]  And I can't prosecute this war against the New World Order without your support.
[00:08:53.686 --> 00:09:11.118]  So I want to ask you on this July 4th, 2022, to redouble your efforts to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, to pray for our crew, to pray for our hosts, to pray for our reporters, to pray for me, and to pray for a global awakening to accelerate, which is already happening, and to support us financially.
[00:09:11.858 --> 00:09:15.861]  My friends, the enemy's unpopular and they know it.
[00:09:15.921 --> 00:09:40.758]   They want to try to gaslight us into submission, but I got to tell you, If the general public, and especially a lot of wealthy people and upper middle class nouveau riche that have sat on the bench, realize you're going to lose everything in this inflationary New World Order, and you're going to be targeted under a neo-fascist global government directing communist policies at the grassroots, if you will simply realize that and awaken to it and say no to it, it's game over.
[00:09:41.991 --> 00:09:44.633]  And one of the most important ways to resist it is financially.
[00:09:45.013 --> 00:09:51.937]  So we try to sell products at Infowarsstore.com that enrich your life, your immune system, your libido, and everything else.
[00:09:52.937 --> 00:10:01.962]  And the only way you fail is not reaching out and supporting the literal front lines of the fight, the tip of the spear, the heart of the pro-human rebellion against these transhumanists.
[00:10:02.022 --> 00:10:04.704]  So, we have a July 4th Super Sale running.
[00:10:04.744 --> 00:10:06.465]  It's the biggest sale of the year.
[00:10:07.105 --> 00:10:08.146]  And celebrate 1776 Part 2.
[00:10:10.851 --> 00:10:14.993]  Celebrate human resistance by spreading the word and going to infowarestore.com.
[00:10:15.573 --> 00:10:19.675]  We have double Patriot points and up to 75% off.
[00:10:19.935 --> 00:10:22.116]  That means we're losing money on some of these products.
[00:10:22.136 --> 00:10:27.338]  We've got to clear them out of the warehouse to just make payroll and to pay for the massive bandwidth because we're so popular.
[00:10:27.658 --> 00:10:32.640]  And it's satellite uplinks and all of the legal bills fighting the Democratic Party trying to shut us down.
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.600]  This is your fight.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.921]  This is so important.
[00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:38.953]  I just want to encourage you to take action today, as so many of you have done.
[00:10:38.973 --> 00:10:46.822]  I want to thank you for your past support, but encourage you to get products and stock up on them, because if they shut us down or implode us or curtail us, maybe the last time you can get these products.
[00:10:47.522 --> 00:10:53.489]  So July 4th, SuperSell starts now, but 75% off plus double-paid rate points, 40% off knockout sleep support.

[00:11:50.562 --> 00:11:54.803]   sad to say I think the hair and beard is a little bit better a little bit
[00:11:54.803 --> 00:11:56.770]   stronger That's just how it worked out with what supplier we use.
[00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:03.198]  So, hair and beard below cost, 75% off, great multivitamin for children, adults, you name it.

[00:12:14.791 --> 00:12:15.371]  Where's the air filters?
[00:12:15.391 --> 00:12:16.111]  Where's the preparedness items?
[00:12:16.351 --> 00:12:18.132]  They're all at preparetoday.com.

[00:12:32.636 --> 00:12:34.837]  Dr. Zelenko is coming up from the grave.
[00:12:35.257 --> 00:12:41.169]  So many other big interviews on this July 4th, but I want to thank those of you that tuned in on this historic, important day.
[00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:44.315]  But here, my friends, is the rest of the story.
[00:12:45.586 --> 00:12:55.693]  As we celebrate Independence Day from West Point, our next guest is sounding the alarm on the far left's attempt to cancel our nation's birthday, our founding fathers, and the American flag.
[00:12:56.073 --> 00:13:02.918]  He is the author of the 56th Liberty Lessons from Those Who Risked All to Sign the Declaration of Independence.
[00:13:03.219 --> 00:13:07.522]  And he joined my podcast from the kitchen table not too long ago to talk all about it.
[00:13:07.542 --> 00:13:11.004]  If you haven't seen it, you can go back, catch that episode.
[00:13:11.044 --> 00:13:12.045]  It's fascinating.
[00:13:12.405 --> 00:13:14.186]  Douglas MacKinnon joins us now.
[00:13:14.266 --> 00:13:18.608]   Douglas, so I'm grateful to have you here on Fox & Friends, not just on our podcast.
[00:13:19.149 --> 00:13:21.209]  So tell me why you wrote this book.
[00:13:21.249 --> 00:13:22.430]  Let our viewers know that.
[00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:26.471]  So Rachel, just last July 3rd, I wasn't even thinking about writing the book.
[00:13:26.491 --> 00:13:32.174]  And then on the 4th of July of last year, I did a little bit of a video tour through some of the more liberal news sites out there.
[00:13:32.654 --> 00:13:35.975]  And on site after site, I saw guest after guest on the left.
[00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:39.854]   left calling for not only the cancellation of the 4th of July, but the cancellation of
[00:13:39.854 --> 00:13:42.434]  our founding fathers and the American flag.
[00:13:42.434 --> 00:13:45.974]   And I decided at that point, I called my publisher, I said, if we don't put out a book, if we
[00:13:45.974 --> 00:13:50.134]   don't defend these men, if we don't defend that time, if we don't defend the genius of
[00:13:50.134 --> 00:13:53.533]   the founding fathers, we're going to lose our chance to do so.
[00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:54.814]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:13:54.826 --> 00:14:10.725]  If your kids, by the way, this is a great book to have in your family home, to give to graduates, to give to any of your kids, because some of us know the big names in the book, but there's 56 signers here, and when they signed this, they were basically risking their lives.
[00:14:10.745 --> 00:14:11.566]  It was an act of treason.
[00:14:11.766 --> 00:14:12.146]  Well, they were.
[00:14:12.166 --> 00:14:16.887]  As a matter of fact, each and every one of them knew they were signing their own death warrant when they signed the Declaration of Independence.
[00:14:16.927 --> 00:14:17.407]  And guess what?
[00:14:17.788 --> 00:14:26.390]  So many of them were arrested, had their homes burned to the ground, had their wives arrested, their wives in prison, their wives sexually abused, their livestock slaughtered.
[00:14:26.830 --> 00:14:31.131]  And again, this is the price they paid to create the greatest nation on the face of the earth.
[00:14:31.391 --> 00:14:33.651]  And they don't teach this in our schools anymore, Rachel.
[00:14:33.692 --> 00:14:33.812]  No.
[00:14:34.152 --> 00:14:39.533]  American children do not learn that these were the heroes that created the greatest nation on the face of the earth.
[00:14:39.693 --> 00:14:45.359]  Yeah, I mean, many kids are thinking that this period of time was something to be ashamed of.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.621]  It's quite the opposite.
[00:14:47.402 --> 00:14:53.589]  Tell me what we can learn in this moment in time right now that we're in, because a lot of our viewers are concerned about this moment in time.
[00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:57.733]  What can we learn from these founders, from the people who signed the Declaration of Independence?
[00:14:57.813 --> 00:14:59.135]  What are the lessons encouraged?
[00:14:59.295 --> 00:14:59.475]  Right.
[00:14:59.555 --> 00:15:00.215]  That we should learn.
[00:15:00.295 --> 00:15:15.683]  Well, I talk about it in the book, too, because, again, as bad as the tyranny was in 1776, in many ways, as I say, it's worse now, in 2022, because the far left, unfortunately, is taking control over the five major megaphones of our nation, meaning the media, entertainment, academia, and of late, science and medicine.
[00:15:15.963 --> 00:15:22.366]  And what these 56 men would tell us, unless and until they imprison us, unless and until they take our lives, we have our voices.
[00:15:22.386 --> 00:15:23.447]  They cannot silence us.
[00:15:23.747 --> 00:15:26.048]  We have to speak to the greatness of this country.
[00:15:26.268 --> 00:15:33.293]   We have to talk to each other about Why these values are so important, why the rule of law are so important, and why our history is so important.
[00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:36.075]  If our history is bad, let us condemn it and learn from it.
[00:15:36.115 --> 00:15:41.620]  If it's good, let us praise it and build upon it, but let us never ever cancel our shared American history.
[00:15:42.748 --> 00:15:44.790]  Douglas, your book could not be more timely.
[00:15:45.151 --> 00:15:50.117]  It is a moment for courage and we can take a lot of inspiration from those who signed the Declaration of Independence.
[00:15:50.417 --> 00:15:54.382]  He goes through every single one of the 56 and tells you a little bit about them.
[00:15:54.402 --> 00:15:55.443]  The book is fascinating.
[00:15:55.723 --> 00:15:56.424]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:15:56.504 --> 00:15:58.226]  What a perfect day and a perfect location.
[00:15:58.407 --> 00:15:59.528]  It's an honor for me to be here.
[00:15:59.568 --> 00:16:00.028]  Thanks so much.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.964]  What do you think the most important issue for your state is?
[00:16:04.524 --> 00:16:06.106]  We've got a couple of important issues.
[00:16:06.126 --> 00:16:07.428]  We have a wide open border.
[00:16:07.468 --> 00:16:08.730]  We have fentanyl pouring in.
[00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:11.133]  We have the cartels with operational control.
[00:16:11.513 --> 00:16:14.778]  But that wouldn't be happening if we would have fair, honest elections.
[00:16:19.235 --> 00:16:24.880]  We had a fraudulent election, a corrupt election, and we have an illegitimate president sitting in the White House.
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.742]  And because of that, our border is wide open.
[00:16:27.842 --> 00:16:33.246]  Five and a half tons of fentanyl was confiscated last year, enough to kill over two billion people.
[00:16:33.266 --> 00:16:35.168]  It's a weapon of mass destruction.
[00:16:35.648 --> 00:16:39.471]  And that's why we're going to secure that border starting on day one.
[00:16:39.511 --> 00:16:44.075]   After I take my hand off the Bible, we are going to issue a We're going to do a declaration of invasion.
[00:16:44.135 --> 00:16:45.977]  We're going to finish President Trump's wall.
[00:16:46.358 --> 00:16:51.423]  And we're going to send our armed National Guard to the border and stop people from coming across.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:17:05.868]  Just to circle back, you say that it's an illegitimate president, you say that the election was stolen, you speak a lot about this on the campaign trail, talking about the 2020 election.
[00:17:06.348 --> 00:17:11.232]  This is the Arizona House Speaker, Rusty Bowers, testifying in front of Congress last week.
[00:17:11.652 --> 00:17:17.657]  Anywhere, anyone, anytime has said that I said the election was rigged, that would not be true.
[00:17:17.777 --> 00:17:27.435]   There was no evidence being presented of any strength, He's a Republican, he's a Trump supporter, and that's what he said.
[00:17:28.536 --> 00:17:29.316]  He's a rhino.
[00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:35.480]  Here's what we have.
[00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.302]  740,000 ballots that have no chain of custody.
[00:17:38.342 --> 00:17:41.203]  They cannot be authenticated and they should not have been counted.
[00:17:41.223 --> 00:17:45.186]  34,000 ballots that were counted two, three, and four times.
[00:17:45.666 --> 00:17:48.108]  People who moved who still voted in our election.
[00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:57.788]  There's a mountain of evidence and I wish that the corporate media would start covering it instead of putting their head in the sand and acting like it didn't happen.
[00:17:58.028 --> 00:18:11.702]  I understand what you're saying, but there have been, as you know, more than 70 court cases where there was not evidence and there was not any state legislature or governor that failed to certify an election, including your own Republican Doug Ducey.
[00:18:12.242 --> 00:18:15.324]  We did not have any court cases where the evidence was presented.
[00:18:15.364 --> 00:18:21.747]  We now have evidence that is admissible in a court of law, and I believe the day will come where we have that court case.
[00:18:22.208 --> 00:18:28.771]  We have an AG, Mark Bernadette, who has sat on a mountain of evidence and done nothing, including video evidence.
[00:18:31.833 --> 00:18:33.574]  We have the truth of vote evidence.
[00:18:34.034 --> 00:18:37.777]  We have people who do not want to uncover the truth about our election.
[00:18:38.437 --> 00:18:40.258]  When I'm governor, we're going to get to the bottom of it.
[00:18:41.593 --> 00:18:43.455]  We thank you and we'll cover the primary.
[00:18:43.475 --> 00:18:44.076]  Thank you.
[00:18:44.096 --> 00:18:46.879]  Please send reporters out to cover this corrupt election.
[00:18:46.919 --> 00:18:47.740]  We would appreciate it.
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:19:09.179]  Thank you.

[00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.530]  I want to thank you all.
[00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:45.731]  This July 4th for your continued fight for America, and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now, because we're so close to winning.
[00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:54.090]   InfoWarStore.com and celebrate July 4th, 1776, part two against the New World Order, because
[00:19:54.090 --> 00:20:03.171]  the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:20:03.171 --> 00:20:09.171]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:09.171 --> 00:20:11.510]  (whooshing)
[00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:21.510]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:20:13.388 --> 00:20:23.475]  So, the globalists have always, in the last 200 years of their rule of Europe expanding into the U.S.
[00:20:23.495 --> 00:20:34.902]  and now worldwide, in this mass risk game, the power elite have always, at the end of their life, had one obsession, not wanting to give it all up.
[00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:38.884]  But they have their generational institutions.
[00:20:38.904 --> 00:20:42.646]  The New World Order is like a corrupt, organized crime university.
[00:20:42.846 --> 00:20:48.889]  They teach the system and it continues and they have their idols, their forefathers and mothers and it just continues.
[00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:56.433]  As they refine the science of power and control and dehumanization, which is their pleasure.
[00:20:58.354 --> 00:21:00.755]  They've never wanted to turn loose of life.
[00:21:03.484 --> 00:21:05.405]  Do any of us want to turn loose of life?
[00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:08.727]  Sure, when we get old enough and enough pain, it's easier and we can let go.
[00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:20.895]  And so many ancient cultures, the elites engaged in those bizarre abusive behaviors, believing on their people, believing that would give them longer life.
[00:21:22.155 --> 00:21:24.777]  Only because the priest class knew how to manipulate them.
[00:21:27.599 --> 00:21:31.261]  The magicians, the con artists, the scam men of the day.
[00:21:35.214 --> 00:21:54.945]  And so now, here in 2002, for the first time in human recorded history, eternal life is now actually possible for the forces of the New World Order.
[00:21:56.832 --> 00:22:05.794]  So when you ask, why would the globalists say, and they've said it on the record a thousand times, that they want to get rid of 80% of us and reduce mass plagues to do it?
[00:22:09.634 --> 00:22:30.645]   When they propose this and prepare this and produce it in their labyrinthine underground facilities in Fort Dedrick and Porton Down in Wiltshire, England, and brag they have it, and prepare us for the attacks, Their excuse, and they've actually said it, you read their policy papers, they start talking about this.
[00:22:32.766 --> 00:22:42.931]  About how they need a 500 million technician, scientist, worker class, different stratas they're in, to serve several hundred families.
[00:22:44.913 --> 00:22:56.096]  And these creatures, these globalists, are going to get the new tissue regeneration, the brain grafts, the nanotechnology revolution, the cybernetic interfaces.
[00:22:56.116 --> 00:22:58.317]  They're going to get it all.
[00:22:58.737 --> 00:23:02.058]  I mean, already the technology we see is 30 years suppressed.
[00:23:04.759 --> 00:23:07.200]  I mean, they're on a mad power trip now.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:17.717]   And they're laying this intricate cashless society control grid And easing us into it and selling it to us.
[00:23:20.459 --> 00:23:24.459]   and hurting us off the rural areas into the cities the name of environmentalism
[00:23:24.459 --> 00:23:36.099]   and security and once they have is in the compact cities
[00:23:36.099 --> 00:23:53.099]   there will be a ratcheting up of biological attacks [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:23:45.290 --> 00:24:15.520]   When you watch a hundred million people die of genetically engineered super smallpox and anthrax, and stuff they haven't even released, in India, when you watch it released in China, when you see it hit Africa, When you see it hit Latin America, remember Alex Jones warning you.
[00:24:16.061 --> 00:24:25.029]  There may still be a chance at that point to remember this emergency warning from time to you.
[00:24:25.849 --> 00:24:32.849]  Remember.
[00:24:32.849 --> 00:24:37.849]  Remember the cynical smile and the laugh.
[00:24:37.737 --> 00:24:39.758]  Remember you didn't heed the warning.
[00:24:42.458 --> 00:24:43.459]  Long after I'm gone.
[00:24:46.559 --> 00:25:02.506]   As we watch a mass cull, after several ratchetings we're going to see in the next decade as the terror events get larger, then as they hit what we think is the mass cull, Then it will go to the microchipped population.
[00:25:02.646 --> 00:25:05.049]  The face scan to leave your house, to get in your car.
[00:25:05.349 --> 00:25:09.694]  To the borders with giant walls stretching up towards the sky.
[00:25:10.655 --> 00:25:11.936]  Helicopters everywhere.
[00:25:12.937 --> 00:25:18.924]  In the name of security, in the name of keeping the Great Death out of the United States.
[00:25:20.842 --> 00:25:23.725]  Our government will be nuking foreign countries.
[00:25:23.785 --> 00:25:25.566]  There will be wholesale mass murder.
[00:25:26.126 --> 00:25:30.646]   and you will be so afraid during this period you will be cheering at mass
[00:25:30.646 --> 00:25:40.126]   rallies in sports stadiums cheering on your imperial world leader
[00:25:40.126 --> 00:25:44.726]   and then after the rest the population has been basically wiped out with small
[00:25:44.726 --> 00:25:48.366]   enclaves hiding in caves around the world they're gonna call this country
[00:25:49.343 --> 00:25:52.486]  And there would have been some large cullings before that in the hundreds of thousands.
[00:25:55.268 --> 00:26:04.976]  Again, I have documents, I have evidence, I have news stories, I have globalist statements, and I have understanding of their program, and I see the grid like a map.
[00:26:06.117 --> 00:26:09.499]  In intricate detail, laid out with exactly what they're going to do.
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:12.662]  All we don't understand is their precise time frame.
[00:26:13.763 --> 00:26:17.186]  All I know is it's moving very quickly and it is of great concern.
[00:26:21.056 --> 00:26:50.377]   Their delusional rationale is that after the mass culling, if you talk to Ted Turner or Prince Philip or any of these globalists that have put this on the record, their rationale is that after they've gotten rid of 80% of us, and their documents show the only groups they're going to allow to live are Caucasians and some groups of Asians, These people make the Nazis look like a tea party.
[00:26:51.077 --> 00:26:54.260]  Everybody's starting to talk about the extermination plan.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.343]  You know, the globalists engineered World War I, World War II, and the rest of it.
[00:26:58.363 --> 00:27:00.224]  They put Hitler and Stalin in power now.
[00:27:00.604 --> 00:27:02.806]  They killed 200 million plus people last century.
[00:27:04.787 --> 00:27:06.008]  And they're not playing games.
[00:27:06.308 --> 00:27:07.029]  It's their pleasure.
[00:27:07.069 --> 00:27:08.050]  They're completely ruthless.
[00:27:09.858 --> 00:27:23.063]  And now they've got this great prize of life extension, but they're having to suppress all this technology, and it's getting harder and harder for them, and other third world countries are starting to develop some of it, and make their own discoveries.
[00:27:25.663 --> 00:27:29.304]   and so they're in a race to keep it all for themselves and they've got they're
[00:27:29.304 --> 00:27:44.144]   gonna do it pretty soon in femur region three year on the air worldwide
[00:27:44.144 --> 00:27:45.702]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:27:45.441 --> 00:27:47.042]  Alex, it's an honor to talk to you.
[00:27:47.502 --> 00:27:47.902]  Yes, sir.
[00:27:48.103 --> 00:27:49.844]  Real quick, I just want to plug X2.
[00:27:50.004 --> 00:27:52.185]  Man, I've been taking it for the last month and a half.
[00:27:52.446 --> 00:27:53.967]  It's made amazing changes.
[00:27:54.067 --> 00:27:55.168]  I started dreaming again.
[00:27:55.408 --> 00:27:57.129]  It's just, it's amazing.
[00:27:57.429 --> 00:27:58.630]  I just feel better.
[00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.111]  Like, it's hard to explain.
[00:28:00.151 --> 00:28:02.212]  I feel like I'm more hydrated.
[00:28:02.232 --> 00:28:02.993]  I'm a roofer.
[00:28:03.113 --> 00:28:06.495]  It normally takes a lot of water to stay hydrated for me.
[00:28:06.616 --> 00:28:08.377]  It feels like I'm retaining water better.
[00:28:08.437 --> 00:28:10.198]  Like I said, I started dreaming again.
[00:28:10.238 --> 00:28:15.638]   I was driving out a dream in 15 years and two weeks after taking it I was starting to
[00:28:15.638 --> 00:28:17.678]  dream every single night.
[00:28:17.678 --> 00:28:20.557]  This isn't some new age thing, they just piggyback on it.
[00:28:20.557 --> 00:28:25.417]   The pineal gland gets filled with fluoride and that's the third eye, literally.
[00:28:25.417 --> 00:28:28.957]   It's connected to higher dreaming, higher consciousness medically and then obviously
[00:28:28.957 --> 00:28:30.998]  the ancients said spiritual connection.
[00:28:30.998 --> 00:28:34.557]   And when it gets filled with fluoride and bromide and bromine and all the bad allergens,
[00:28:34.557 --> 00:28:35.718]  then people don't dream.
[00:28:35.819 --> 00:28:38.079]  And they don't have higher consciousness, statistically.
[00:28:38.179 --> 00:28:41.340]  But real iodine goes through and just burns all that out.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.840]  It doesn't just get in there.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.361]  It removes the bad stuff in the major studies.
[00:28:45.441 --> 00:28:46.901]  That's why everybody should get X2.

[00:29:01.583 --> 00:29:04.243]  (air whooshing)
[00:29:04.243 --> 00:29:11.903]   They don't want this brain trust, this spirit trust on air.
[00:29:12.042 --> 00:29:14.904]  They want to get to you, and they got to get through us to get to you.
[00:29:15.244 --> 00:29:17.525]  They want to get to my children, they got to get through me first.
[00:29:17.905 --> 00:29:20.247]  They want to get to your family, they got to get through you first.
[00:29:20.507 --> 00:29:25.790]  And I'm telling you, I'm on record, the one thing I want to do is beat these Satanists, and I don't back off 1%.
[00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.952]  I am full-on war with these people.
[00:29:29.192 --> 00:29:32.894]  But I need your backing if you want me to go in there and stomp the living hell out of these people.
[00:29:33.601 --> 00:29:43.087]  So I want you to go now to infowarrestore.com, as you've done before, and gotten great products that enrich you, that enrich us, that we 360 win together, and build our community of victory now!

[00:29:49.651 --> 00:29:50.852]  This is the best prices ever.
[00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:53.693]  The bad news is a bunch of this stuff is sold out.
[00:29:53.974 --> 00:29:57.336]  We're not even sure we're gonna get it again, but we gotta have the money now.
[00:29:59.011 --> 00:30:06.854]  So we have Super Female Vitality Cold Press Compounded Herbs that are known to supercharge vitality in women, including libido.
[00:30:07.195 --> 00:30:08.955]  It's an incredible product.
[00:30:09.396 --> 00:30:13.878]  That and the super powerful Ionine Surface Spray, the strongest thing out there known.
[00:30:14.997 --> 00:30:17.360]  Knocks out anything in seconds on services.
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:23.707]  Both of those, ladies and gentlemen, are 60% off of double Patriot points.
[00:30:24.087 --> 00:30:28.352]  And then hair and beard formula, which I'll just be honest, has been a terrible seller.
[00:30:28.392 --> 00:30:30.735]  We got 20,000 bottles of it and nobody wants to buy it.
[00:30:30.775 --> 00:30:31.555]  Nobody likes it.
[00:30:31.596 --> 00:30:34.819]  And guys that have beards think they don't need that kind of crap with our audience.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:43.107]  It's a super vitamin mineral, high-end multivitamin mineral that kids could take, old people, young people, you name it.
[00:30:43.147 --> 00:30:45.709]  I'm tempted to pull the labels off of it and just say multivitamin on it.
[00:30:46.089 --> 00:30:49.752]  We can't keep the multivitamin stock, and quite frankly, that's what I said when we got this in.
[00:30:49.772 --> 00:30:52.795]  I said, this is a better formula than our multivitamin, which is incredible!
[00:30:53.075 --> 00:30:54.557]  This one's a little bit better.
[00:30:55.413 --> 00:31:01.555]  So, the Heron Beer Formula is an amazing multivitamin mineral for your immune system, your body, and we can't sell the damn thing.
[00:31:01.895 --> 00:31:03.796]  It costs us more per bottle.
[00:31:03.836 --> 00:31:05.577]  It's high-end, but we're selling it for.
[00:31:05.797 --> 00:31:07.478]  We're clearing that sucker out right now.

[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:41.621]  We're blowing everything out right now.
[00:31:41.641 --> 00:31:45.262]  It's more like a locomotive firing up that engine to go full power.
[00:31:45.282 --> 00:31:47.682]  And I don't care what happens is up to God now.
[00:31:47.942 --> 00:31:51.463]  I'm throwing it all in against them and going head to head with these people.
[00:31:51.442 --> 00:31:53.442]  And you're backing me and I love you.
[00:31:53.442 --> 00:31:54.442]  Hmm.
[00:31:54.442 --> 00:32:08.442]   I live in the American Gardens building on West 81st Street, on the 11th floor.
[00:32:08.442 --> 00:32:10.442]  floor.
[00:32:10.498 --> 00:32:11.899]  My name is Patrick Bateman.
[00:32:12.439 --> 00:32:13.600]  I'm 27 years old.
[00:32:15.962 --> 00:32:22.766]  I believe in taking care of myself, in a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine.
[00:32:23.326 --> 00:32:25.588]  There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman.
[00:32:26.835 --> 00:32:28.115]  Some kind of abstraction.
[00:32:28.815 --> 00:32:30.496]  But there is no real me.
[00:32:31.036 --> 00:32:31.956]  Only an entity.
[00:32:32.376 --> 00:32:33.336]  Something illusory.
[00:32:34.336 --> 00:32:47.579]  And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.

[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.640]  Jones.
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:35.640]  [MUSIC]
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.640]  We can do this.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:44.760]   There's compelling evidence that the law enforcement response to the attack at Rob Elementary was an abject
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:54.640]   failure and antithetical to everything we've learned over the last two decades since the Columbine massacre.
[00:33:54.910 --> 00:34:05.015]  Three minutes after the subject entered the West Building, there were a sufficient number of armed officers wearing body armor to isolate, distract, and neutralize the subject.
[00:34:07.065 --> 00:34:18.636]  The only thing stopping a hallway of dedicated officers from entering room 111 and 112 was the on-scene commander, who decided to place the lives of officers before the lives of children.
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:23.360]  The officers had weapons.
[00:34:23.641 --> 00:34:24.542]  The children had none.
[00:34:24.922 --> 00:34:26.003]  The officers had body armor.
[00:34:26.043 --> 00:34:26.944]  The children had none.
[00:34:26.964 --> 00:34:29.006]  The officers had training.
[00:34:29.026 --> 00:34:29.887]  The subject had none.
[00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:37.167]  One error, 14 minutes and 8 seconds.
[00:34:37.187 --> 00:34:44.754]  That's how long the children waited and the teachers waited in rooms 111 to be rescued.
[00:34:44.774 --> 00:34:52.721]  And while they waited, the on-seat commander waited for radio and rifles.
[00:34:54.042 --> 00:34:55.003]  Then he waited for shields.
[00:34:55.984 --> 00:34:57.065]  Then he waited for SWAT.
[00:34:58.866 --> 00:35:01.389]  Lastly, he waited for a key that was never needed.
[00:35:03.539 --> 00:35:08.186]  The post-call-of-mind doctrine is clear and compelling and unambiguous.
[00:35:08.967 --> 00:35:09.808]  Stop the killing.
[00:35:10.509 --> 00:35:11.370]  Stop the dying.
[00:35:12.191 --> 00:35:16.017]  That's the head of the Texas State Police, Steve McGraw, testifying.
[00:35:17.637 --> 00:35:19.618]  with the legislature on what's happening.
[00:35:19.718 --> 00:35:31.466]  And I'm going to get into this more next hour, but I want to bring it up to Drew Hernandez, because she has reported extensively in the war zone, that is the Texas and Arizona borders particularly, in depth for us for years.
[00:35:31.486 --> 00:35:32.787]  We've been down there with him many times.
[00:35:33.968 --> 00:35:35.389]  And this is a subject I want to raise here.
[00:35:35.409 --> 00:35:42.634]  I don't want to just harp, like I normally do, on how demonic the pro-abortion people are, how they hate babies, or how they say they love Satan.
[00:35:42.914 --> 00:35:44.495]  That's important, but not the key.
[00:35:45.714 --> 00:35:53.461]  I don't want to just talk about, oh look, another 50 dead illegals locked up to die in a tractor trailer, another week goes by, and another tragedy.
[00:35:54.241 --> 00:35:55.282]  It's all interconnected.
[00:35:55.302 --> 00:36:05.231]  We hear a lot about white privilege in this country, which is a made-up Marxist term to turn us all against each other, but I'll tell you where there is privilege.
[00:36:06.191 --> 00:36:11.336]  If you can make it out of your mother's womb, you get more rights, and you have the privilege of not being killed, and it being against the law.
[00:36:13.092 --> 00:36:35.474]  And if you had a tractor trailer of citizens, whether they were Hispanic, black, white, Asian, and if, say, in Wisconsin, they found a tractor trailer full of 50 black people dead, or 50 Hispanic citizens dead, or 50 white people dead, or a mix of people, it would be the end of the world, and we'd know everything about it, and who locked them in there, who helped their families ransom for money.
[00:36:36.567 --> 00:36:58.935]  But because it's illegal aliens, a permanent underclass, migrants, being brought in by the coyotes and the money being laundered by the Democratic Party, with the broken border by design, they're not human, ladies and gentlemen, according to the very people that are using them and letting them use children as a free ticket into this country, in many cases that aren't any relation to them.
[00:37:01.357 --> 00:37:04.379]  So I'm going to play this clip and go to Drew Hernandez for the balance of the hour.
[00:37:04.419 --> 00:37:06.401]  But this clip's from making the rounds this week.
[00:37:07.661 --> 00:37:09.142]  Joe Rogan sent it to me this weekend.
[00:37:09.703 --> 00:37:10.483]  I meant to get to it.
[00:37:10.523 --> 00:37:11.184]  Now it's viral.
[00:37:11.204 --> 00:37:11.944]  Now it's everywhere.
[00:37:12.044 --> 00:37:14.826]  It's Mike Judge's new Beavis and Butthead movie.
[00:37:14.967 --> 00:37:16.708]  I haven't seen it yet, but I've seen this clip.
[00:37:17.869 --> 00:37:18.629]  Of white privilege.
[00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:21.291]  And Beavis and Butthead are obviously total morons.
[00:37:22.452 --> 00:37:23.993]  And they got IQs of about 75.
[00:37:24.273 --> 00:37:29.697]  These fictional characters that my friend Mike Judge created decades ago, 30-something years ago.
[00:37:31.298 --> 00:37:35.860]  And they're told by the professor, you have privilege because you're white.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.780]  You can commit crimes, you can do whatever you want.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:38.721]  Of course, that's not true.
[00:37:40.861 --> 00:37:49.424]  National statistics show that police are twice as likely, per capita, per 1,000 whites, 1,000 blacks, twice as likely to shoot whites.
[00:37:49.984 --> 00:37:50.444]  Why is that?
[00:37:50.464 --> 00:37:51.305]  Are they out to kill whites?
[00:37:51.385 --> 00:37:51.505]  No.
[00:37:52.625 --> 00:37:57.769]  They know that if they make a mistake, particularly in a black home, they'll be crucified and fired and probably put in prison.
[00:37:58.330 --> 00:38:00.192]  Or they go to a domestic dispute or a shootout.
[00:38:00.412 --> 00:38:01.493]  So they slow roll.
[00:38:02.514 --> 00:38:05.996]  And then you have the highest crime rates in the black area because they can't carry out law enforcement.
[00:38:06.677 --> 00:38:07.398]  That's the main cause.
[00:38:08.238 --> 00:38:09.680]  So again, yeah, there's white privilege.
[00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.241]  You're twice as likely to be shot by police.
[00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:20.189]  But not because they're hunting white people, because they actually respond, which is a form of discrimination, but only because they get discriminated against and are scared to go into the black areas.
[00:38:22.162 --> 00:38:26.028]  So that's the reality here of the white privilege, is it's a mixed bag, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:27.110 --> 00:38:33.319]  And it's 10 to 1 black-on-white crime because there are some racist black people that think white people deserve to be robbed and killed just because they're white.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:34.881]  And the left promotes that.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:38.423]  So that's the reality of the white privilege.
[00:38:39.324 --> 00:38:44.330]  There's privilege if you're a citizen and you live in this country and you get found dead, the media will cover it.
[00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:49.496]  But they don't want it covered because they are busting the border and smuggling millions of people in.
[00:38:49.816 --> 00:38:59.801]   And so if you're one of these new permanent underclass being brought in by the Democratic Party, You aren't treated as human, and that's the real Democratic Party privilege.
[00:39:00.181 --> 00:39:01.222]  They have armed guards.
[00:39:01.282 --> 00:39:02.002]  They have police.
[00:39:02.302 --> 00:39:04.723]  They don't want citizens to have them, no matter what color you are.
[00:39:05.404 --> 00:39:13.488]  There's elite privilege, Bilderberg group, Davos group, World Economic Forum group, privilege, and then there's all the rest of us being turned against each other and played off.
[00:39:13.948 --> 00:39:15.869]  But here is the Beavis and Butthead piece.
[00:39:16.639 --> 00:39:19.560]  This is a classic example of white privilege.
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.660]  And you both have it.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:24.300]  Uh, what's that?
[00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.281]  Anyone want to fill them in?
[00:39:26.621 --> 00:39:27.661]  Um, yeah, I'll do it.
[00:39:28.101 --> 00:39:28.341]  Okay.
[00:39:28.721 --> 00:39:34.122]  So, white privilege is when white people, particularly men, automatically assume they can take whatever they want.
[00:39:34.362 --> 00:39:36.823]  And they never have to worry about getting stopped by the police.
[00:39:37.523 --> 00:39:40.963]  And they have the inside track for any job they- I got this one, Aisha.
[00:39:41.143 --> 00:39:44.504]  They have the inside track for any job they want.
[00:39:45.189 --> 00:39:46.410]  Exactly, Gage.
[00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:47.391]  Thank you for that.
[00:39:48.392 --> 00:39:49.493]  That's white privilege.
[00:39:50.354 --> 00:39:52.275]  Whoa, and we have that?
[00:39:52.716 --> 00:39:53.456]  You sure do.
[00:39:53.476 --> 00:39:55.058]  I see.
[00:39:55.418 --> 00:39:57.440]  Whoa, I never realized this stuff.
[00:39:58.761 --> 00:40:00.663]  Yeah, you've really opened up my eyes.
[00:40:01.043 --> 00:40:03.305]  Well, I'm glad we've been able to enlighten you.
[00:40:03.905 --> 00:40:07.789]  The real question is, do you think you'll be acting differently from now on?
[00:40:09.171 --> 00:40:11.052]  Uh, I guarantee it.
[00:40:11.312 --> 00:40:13.492]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, me too, yeah.
[00:40:13.592 --> 00:40:14.713]  Step aside, please.
[00:40:14.933 --> 00:40:16.173]  We have white privilege.
[00:40:17.093 --> 00:40:18.354]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, check it out.
[00:40:18.574 --> 00:40:21.614]  Don't worry, it's okay.
[00:40:22.755 --> 00:40:26.536]  We automatically assume we can take what we want, and we don't have to worry about the police.
[00:40:27.016 --> 00:40:28.896]  It's okay, you didn't know.
[00:40:28.936 --> 00:40:30.037]  We didn't either.
[00:40:30.257 --> 00:40:31.217]  Let's stop now.
[00:40:31.837 --> 00:40:34.298]  This is what we were taught, sir.
[00:40:34.378 --> 00:40:38.378]  We're subverting existing paradigms.
[00:40:38.378 --> 00:40:44.378]  That's cool.
[00:40:44.378 --> 00:40:46.378]  [Music]
[00:40:46.331 --> 00:40:49.534]  I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad we went to college.
[00:40:49.554 --> 00:40:52.797]  Yeah, it's like, now I have the skills for today's workplace.
[00:40:54.258 --> 00:40:54.998]  Well, let's see.
[00:40:55.339 --> 00:40:56.299]  What should we take next?
[00:40:57.265 --> 00:40:58.566]  Let's take that car.
[00:41:00.488 --> 00:41:01.689]  But that's a police car.
[00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:03.391]  Beavis, you dumbass.
[00:41:03.651 --> 00:41:04.252]  Didn't you hear?
[00:41:04.752 --> 00:41:07.375]  We don't have to worry about getting stopped by the police.
[00:41:08.916 --> 00:41:09.837]  Okay, Beavis.
[00:41:10.077 --> 00:41:11.218]  Let's tear ass.
[00:41:15.042 --> 00:41:15.502]  That was cool.
[00:41:15.523 --> 00:41:16.203]  Don't move!
[00:41:16.283 --> 00:41:16.784]  Uh, sir?
[00:41:21.570 --> 00:41:23.655]  Maybe you didn't know, but we have white privilege.
[00:41:24.156 --> 00:41:25.379]  Get your hands where I can see them!
[00:41:26.261 --> 00:41:28.486]  I think the problem is you're just uneducated.
[00:41:28.505 --> 00:41:31.505]  And we're gonna get jobs on Wall Street.
[00:41:31.505 --> 00:41:33.634]  Gerard Nandis will be with us a little bit in the next hour.
[00:41:33.634 --> 00:41:35.505]  I appreciate him joining us.
[00:41:35.505 --> 00:41:40.755]   Gerard, I know we're gonna be getting into so many of the big topics out there, but what's your overall view on the
[00:41:40.755 --> 00:41:43.505]   point I just made about there's the elitist privilege and there's the rest of us.
[00:41:43.505 --> 00:41:49.184]   Nancy Pelosi's husband, they won't release the squad car footage, the body cams, you got to run over somebody
[00:41:49.184 --> 00:41:54.505]   reportedly, but because he is married to Nancy Pelosi, that story's being killed.
[00:41:54.505 --> 00:41:59.024]   Well Alex thanks for having me and shout out to the info warrior getter chat right now.
[00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:03.052]  I'm in the chat and they just, they love you Alex and they love what you're doing and just want to encourage you.
[00:42:03.072 --> 00:42:08.634]  There's millions of people out there that love you guys, but to go to your point, the Democrats have always been racist.
[00:42:08.674 --> 00:42:09.655]  You and I both know this.
[00:42:09.715 --> 00:42:11.535]  They're the pro-save slavery party.
[00:42:11.776 --> 00:42:13.776]  They're the anti-civil rights movement party.
[00:42:14.077 --> 00:42:18.437]   They're the ones that have always wanted to oppose minorities. So right now it makes
[00:42:18.437 --> 00:42:23.917]   sense to me that they're the pro-CRT, critical race theory party, where they're literally
[00:42:23.917 --> 00:42:29.756]   engineering racism in our universities, in Hollywood, across the board in corporate America, where
[00:42:29.756 --> 00:42:34.157]   they the ones are pushing the racism. And it's always these racist white liberals that
[00:42:34.157 --> 00:42:39.107]   turn around and tell someone like me, I'll use their terminology, a person of color, that I'm
[00:42:39.107 --> 00:42:42.756]   oppressed and I'm poor and I can't do anything on my own and I should just listen to them.
[00:42:42.943 --> 00:42:51.667]  And even when I'm on the street with people like Savannah on the Hernandez, Savannah Hernandez trying to report, it's always these white liberals that are telling us to shut up and telling people not to talk to us.
[00:42:51.707 --> 00:42:53.208]  So they're the real racists, Alex.
[00:42:53.228 --> 00:42:54.809]  They always have been and they always will be.
[00:42:54.849 --> 00:42:55.189]  That's right.
[00:42:55.209 --> 00:42:57.931]  They're the self-appointed gods over to us all and we're sick of it.
[00:42:57.951 --> 00:42:58.811]  Hernandez, stay there.
[00:42:58.631 --> 00:43:00.631]  there. We'll be right back.
[00:43:00.631 --> 00:43:19.631]   Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
[00:43:19.729 --> 00:43:26.729]  [Music]
[00:43:26.729 --> 00:43:33.729]  [Music]
[00:43:33.729 --> 00:43:40.729]  [Music]
[00:43:40.729 --> 00:43:47.729]  [Music]
[00:43:47.729 --> 00:43:54.729]  [Music]
[00:43:54.729 --> 00:44:01.729]  [Music]
[00:44:01.729 --> 00:44:08.729]  [Music]
[00:44:08.729 --> 00:44:15.729]  [Music]
[00:44:15.729 --> 00:44:22.729]  [Music]
[00:44:22.729 --> 00:44:29.729]  [Music]
[00:44:29.729 --> 00:44:34.729]  and conquer the earth.
[00:44:34.237 --> 00:44:39.237]  When our cause it is just.
[00:44:39.237 --> 00:44:44.237]  And this be our motto.
[00:44:44.237 --> 00:44:49.237]  In God we trust.
[00:44:49.237 --> 00:44:52.237]  In God we trust.
[00:44:52.237 --> 00:44:58.237]  God save the Queen.
[00:44:58.237 --> 00:45:13.237]  I am the greatest.
[00:45:13.237 --> 00:45:35.237]  And the home of the brave.
[00:45:35.237 --> 00:45:50.237]  And the home of the brave.
[00:45:50.237 --> 00:45:52.237]  The Greatest!
[00:45:52.237 --> 00:45:57.237]  The Greatest!
[00:45:57.237 --> 00:45:59.577]  (explosion)
[00:45:59.577 --> 00:46:09.577]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:46:00.762 --> 00:46:06.108]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:10.173]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[00:46:11.064 --> 00:46:14.307]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[00:46:14.608 --> 00:46:15.809]  You might not agree with everything.
[00:46:16.269 --> 00:46:19.352]  You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[00:46:20.093 --> 00:46:22.455]  And there's nowhere else, really, that does it like we do here.
[00:46:22.556 --> 00:46:23.336]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[00:46:23.717 --> 00:46:28.882]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, Infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks.
[00:46:28.942 --> 00:46:30.543]  And we do have the best supplements.
[00:46:30.563 --> 00:46:39.015]   I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, We do the best with our supplements as well.
[00:46:39.035 --> 00:46:41.576]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[00:46:41.756 --> 00:46:43.037]  Folks, this is a joke.
[00:46:43.317 --> 00:46:44.637]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[00:46:44.677 --> 00:46:45.838]  It's 75% off.
[00:46:46.158 --> 00:46:48.499]  By the way, it works for me, in case you haven't noticed.
[00:46:48.719 --> 00:46:52.120]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:54.441]  Quite well, I might add.
[00:46:54.841 --> 00:46:55.661]  Quite well.
[00:46:55.801 --> 00:46:58.822]  My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[00:46:58.862 --> 00:47:00.183]  I go and see him quite often now.
[00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:07.077]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:07.398 --> 00:47:09.398]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:09.398 --> 00:47:24.398]  [Music]
[00:47:24.398 --> 00:47:28.398]   Well, in the last three years, Drew Hernandez has exploded on the scene
[00:47:28.398 --> 00:47:35.398]   as one of the most intrepid, fearless reporters covering Antifa, riots, the border, you name it.
[00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:36.850]  He's a good friend of mine now.
[00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:38.551]  We've gone on the road quite a bit together.
[00:47:39.171 --> 00:47:43.172]  He also teams up with Savannah Hernandez, and they're just really kicking ass.
[00:47:43.192 --> 00:47:44.493]  She works with Turning Point USA.
[00:47:44.533 --> 00:47:47.634]  She works with Truth Social, and they also work with Infowars.
[00:47:48.991 --> 00:47:53.102]  The live feed they shot, they were with us Saturday for two hours, has gone viral.
[00:47:53.764 --> 00:47:56.070]  And tens of millions of people have seen different clips.
[00:47:57.145 --> 00:47:57.986]  From those two hours.
[00:47:58.486 --> 00:47:59.407]  That is success.
[00:48:00.027 --> 00:48:09.834]  The reason I report that to viewers and listeners is you need to know InfoWars and Drew Hernandez and all the people we work with are fighting hard and putting ourselves on the line to expose this evil.
[00:48:10.194 --> 00:48:21.682]  And we appreciate your support and your word of mouth, but it's you sharing the articles from his Twitter and sharing the videos from Bandot Video and his videos that is getting it through the censors and really showing the ugly face of the New World Order.
[00:48:21.702 --> 00:48:22.783]  So I want to get into Roe v. Wade.
[00:48:23.183 --> 00:48:24.444]  I want to get into the summer of rage.
[00:48:24.524 --> 00:48:32.789]  I want to get into the border that you just returned from a few weeks ago that you were telling me on air and off air is just worse than ever than we were even down there a few months ago.
[00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:37.413]  So I want to hit all that, but you're a really articulate guy and I respect your worldview.
[00:48:37.873 --> 00:48:40.054]  What would you call this period we're in right now?
[00:48:40.575 --> 00:48:47.759]  And with 133 days out from the election, with everybody turning against the left, the Democrats, what do you expect them to pull to try to salvage themselves?
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:51.142]  Big picture, what is Drew Hernandez telling his wife and family?
[00:48:51.162 --> 00:48:55.405]   You know, when you're sitting around the table, What do you really think is about to happen?
[00:48:55.425 --> 00:48:57.206]  Because I have a sense of optimism.
[00:48:57.246 --> 00:49:05.131]  People are waking up and humanity is finding its soul again, but also I feel a lot of real anxiety knowing the enemy's got a lot of tricks up their sleeves.
[00:49:06.452 --> 00:49:10.935]  Well, number one, Alex, from a biblical perspective, I'll give you that first.
[00:49:11.015 --> 00:49:21.292]   I think right now we're living in a generation and an era and a time frame right now in the timeline in God's universe and God's creation where This is total depravity.
[00:49:21.652 --> 00:49:22.933]  We've seen this in cycles.
[00:49:22.994 --> 00:49:26.717]  We've seen it in Rome and in Corinth if you study biblical history as well.
[00:49:26.777 --> 00:49:33.324]  We have seen superpowers go through total depravity and a societal reprobate mind.
[00:49:33.344 --> 00:49:40.532]  Now what that means from a biblical perspective is God gives over societies to a reprobate and a depraved mind.
[00:49:40.552 --> 00:49:44.160]   What that means is Someone loses their moral compass.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.661]  They lose all sanity.
[00:49:45.721 --> 00:49:48.643]  They lose the entire ability to discern right from wrong.
[00:49:48.943 --> 00:49:56.427]  And that is a consequence, that is a judgment, according to Romans chapter 1, based off of a society suppressing the truth of God himself.
[00:49:56.747 --> 00:50:12.700]   So as a default, you get total depravity, total lawlessness, zero morality, all void of morality, and some of the distinct I guess we can call marks of that society when you read Romans chapter 1 is a total disrespect of society against one another.
[00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:17.025]  Liars, cheaters, backstabbers, murderers, the list goes on.
[00:50:17.065 --> 00:50:22.410]  But then it turns into open, normalized homosexuality and then total confusion.
[00:50:23.031 --> 00:50:26.515]  If anyone's questioning what I'm saying, just go read Romans chapter 1 for yourself.
[00:50:26.915 --> 00:50:30.059]  And it's literally like you're watching InfoWars in real time.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:30.520]  Why?
[00:50:30.921 --> 00:50:36.328]  Because we're covering this as it's happening in real time, and the Bible told us that all this was going to take place.
[00:50:36.728 --> 00:50:43.958]  So the good news is, the Gospel is always alive and it's always well, and it's always going to have the power to save anybody.
[00:50:44.738 --> 00:50:46.818]  On the verge of dying and going straight to hell.
[00:50:47.599 --> 00:50:49.859]  Now, does that mean that that's going to happen?
[00:50:49.919 --> 00:50:51.419]  Are we going to see a mass revival?
[00:50:51.499 --> 00:50:54.580]  Are we going to see just a mass collapse of the United States of America?
[00:50:54.620 --> 00:50:55.680]  We saw that in Rome.
[00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:56.760]  They dispersed.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:58.000]  They're not lasting forever.
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:51:02.461]  And we can't sit here and think America can last forever as well, because God is always on the throne.
[00:51:02.481 --> 00:51:05.262]  And at the end of the day, he's going to do what he wants to do.
[00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:08.882]  He's going to judge America when he is going to judge America.
[00:51:08.962 --> 00:51:17.872]   And right now, I will say this, Roe v. Wade, And the collapse of it and the pushback and the justices having the courage to strike it down.
[00:51:17.892 --> 00:51:22.913]  We know it's going to go back down to the states, but Alex, you and I both know that that is a glimpse of hope.
[00:51:23.033 --> 00:51:24.134]  That is a ray of light.
[00:51:24.314 --> 00:51:27.635]  A lot of people are seeing that there is hope in this country.
[00:51:27.695 --> 00:51:29.895]  I think that is the momentum.
[00:51:29.915 --> 00:51:36.417]  I was talking about this with Owen on the war room the day that it broke and I told him this is the momentum that we need moving forward.
[00:51:36.777 --> 00:51:43.057]   I think the justices that had the courage to do this set the example, they set the tone, they set the energy,
[00:51:43.057 --> 00:51:48.737]   they set the momentum for other Americans and pro-life, just patriotic, pro-human individuals
[00:51:48.737 --> 00:51:53.295]   in the United States of America and worldwide to continue with this momentum pushing forward,
[00:51:53.295 --> 00:51:58.717]   whether you're in the world of education, entertainment, news, media, wherever it is,
[00:51:58.717 --> 00:52:04.135]   or if you're just a loving, responsible mother or father at home and you're watching everything
[00:52:05.146 --> 00:52:06.567]  This is the momentum we needed.
[00:52:06.807 --> 00:52:08.068]  We cannot let this stop.
[00:52:08.088 --> 00:52:10.290]  We cannot let these people continue to threaten us.
[00:52:10.330 --> 00:52:12.732]  We cannot let these people continue to intimidate us.
[00:52:13.012 --> 00:52:15.194]  Because if we do, that is how we lose.
[00:52:15.234 --> 00:52:16.855]  And I'm not calling for violence.
[00:52:17.155 --> 00:52:19.217]  We can legislatively continue to push back.
[00:52:19.277 --> 00:52:22.180]  And I think the Supreme Court set that example very clearly.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.121]  And we cannot let this momentum fade away, Alex.
[00:52:24.161 --> 00:52:24.982]  You and I both know that.
[00:52:25.851 --> 00:52:26.852]  Beautifully eloquent.
[00:52:27.073 --> 00:52:32.379]  And we should talk about your story, because it's really for people to be able to think about what their destiny could be.
[00:52:33.361 --> 00:52:34.922]  You're a super articulate guy.
[00:52:35.023 --> 00:52:38.207]  I mean, the first time I ever saw you covering something, I said, man, this guy's a natural.
[00:52:38.867 --> 00:52:40.690]  And now you're very prominent.
[00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:42.011]  You're reaching millions of people today.
[00:52:42.873 --> 00:52:44.034]  What were you doing before?
[00:52:44.977 --> 00:52:45.817]  I know you told me this before.
[00:52:45.877 --> 00:52:46.658]  I forget the whole story.
[00:52:47.058 --> 00:52:48.658]  God convicted your heart to get involved.
[00:52:48.678 --> 00:52:49.459]  Can you remind me?
[00:52:49.479 --> 00:52:52.320]  I know that you told me the story, but what got you in the game?
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:53:01.504]  I know there's so many people out there that are just as smart as I am or smarter like you who are on the fence or on the sideline.
[00:53:01.944 --> 00:53:03.164]  Something makes you get in the game.
[00:53:03.524 --> 00:53:12.630]   And I know there's people out there Of every race, color, and creed watching that could do just as great of things as I've done, or you've done, or others have done, but they haven't taken that step.
[00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:16.433]  And that's what I'm all about, is getting people to take that step.
[00:53:16.453 --> 00:53:22.757]  And that's one of my things I'm most proud of, is that so many proud people say, hey, you got me involved, you got me to take action.
[00:53:22.777 --> 00:53:27.080]  I think that's really InfoWars' greatest contribution, is getting people to take action.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.761]  But what was your awakening like?
[00:53:28.821 --> 00:53:29.622]  Or were you already awake?
[00:53:29.662 --> 00:53:30.082]  What happened?
[00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:35.103]  Well, number one, Alex, I became a born-again Christian on February 1st, 2012.
[00:53:36.744 --> 00:53:45.790]  Christ radically changed my heart, my mind, my spirit, opened up my eyes to what the world is really doing and how the world is really functioning on a spiritual level.
[00:53:45.871 --> 00:53:46.851]  There is evil.
[00:53:46.911 --> 00:53:50.514]  There is a real devil, just as God is real, but God is more powerful.
[00:53:50.994 --> 00:53:59.841]  Opening up my eyes to the spiritual aspects of things and then being able to take a look at the world from a biblical worldview, everything begins to stabilize and make sense.
[00:54:01.292 --> 00:54:07.000]  I didn't start getting fully politically engaged until after the election of Donald Trump.
[00:54:07.361 --> 00:54:19.344]   And the reason why is because all of the WikiLeaks that came out, all the intel drops, even InfoWars was putting stuff out, hearing that Hillary Clinton was essentially going to do what President puppet Biden is doing right now.
[00:54:20.085 --> 00:54:27.466]  Open borders, collapsing the economy, just putting Americans in a place where they are controllable and mass destabilization.
[00:54:27.546 --> 00:54:28.767]  All these things were coming out.
[00:54:29.427 --> 00:54:37.889]  And I saw all the lies that were taking place during the 2016 election, where they would call Trump a racist and a liar, a hater of Mexicans and brown people.
[00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:39.989]  On CNN, I would watch that.
[00:54:40.029 --> 00:54:42.490]  And then at night, by day, I would watch that.
[00:54:42.590 --> 00:54:46.611]  And then by night, I would go watch Trump's rallies and listen to his message.
[00:54:47.251 --> 00:54:51.395]  Never heard a single thing about hating brown people or any racist rhetoric.
[00:54:51.435 --> 00:54:56.641]  It was always pro-America, pro-life, pro-individual, pro-Americana, pro-patriotic.
[00:54:56.661 --> 00:54:57.682]  Pro-unification.
[00:54:57.902 --> 00:54:58.803]  He was trying to unify.
[00:54:59.884 --> 00:55:01.686]  Pro-America unification, but...
[00:55:02.384 --> 00:55:16.669]  Seeing that we almost came on the verge of losing the country in 2016, kind of like where we are right now, like I said, that's what really engaged me as a born-again Christian because, number one, I know that I have the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:55:16.689 --> 00:55:18.190]  I have the power of the Word of God.
[00:55:18.570 --> 00:55:19.451]  He lives in me.
[00:55:19.611 --> 00:55:21.093]  He literally works through me.
[00:55:21.173 --> 00:55:22.935]  He does all that He can through me.
[00:55:22.975 --> 00:55:25.578]  If I'm just submissive and obedient to Him, I'm not perfect.
[00:55:25.859 --> 00:55:26.920]  I'll never claim to be that.
[00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:27.741]  Only Christ is.
[00:55:28.482 --> 00:55:34.909]  But I knew that if something could change and God could use me to do something, that now was definitely the time.
[00:55:34.949 --> 00:55:36.091]  I mean, it's always the time.
[00:55:36.531 --> 00:55:48.020]  But for me, I just saw that our country is on the verge of something very evil and satanic, and I just wanted to get involved with whatever God wanted me to get involved with.
[00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:53.224]  I never had any plans of being a reporter, never had any plans of covering riots, never had any plans.
[00:55:53.284 --> 00:56:03.251]  I was a youth pastor, pastoring a local church in Southern California, and that's what I was doing, focusing on them, teaching the Bible, and kind of showing them the world around them from a biblical worldview.
[00:56:03.271 --> 00:56:03.912]  But then this!
[00:56:04.752 --> 00:56:07.813]  Just all unloaded and God had a different plan for me.
[00:56:07.893 --> 00:56:10.934]  So I guess to answer your question, this is a very loaded answer.
[00:56:11.895 --> 00:56:19.117]  Knowing and understanding the urgency of darkness rising and attacking the current and the next generation.
[00:56:20.009 --> 00:56:27.214]  Is what really amplified me to move forward with the truth and obedience to God to oppose tyranny that I saw on the horizon.
[00:56:27.275 --> 00:56:33.659]  So I think in God's plan, I mean, he's never done with us just like he's not done with you Alex and everyone else that's listening right now.
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:38.343]  I know he has a lot more in store and I think this is just the beginning and we'll see where this goes.
[00:56:38.985 --> 00:56:40.305]  Man, I couldn't say it any better.
[00:56:40.566 --> 00:56:42.846]  And it is that sense of urgency.
[00:56:43.647 --> 00:56:50.129]  And just like Trump brought them out of the woodwork, now this Roe v. Wade, bigger than Trump, is going to make them take the mask off.
[00:56:50.169 --> 00:56:50.789]  And they've done that.
[00:56:50.809 --> 00:56:57.648]   Now I want to talk about what you've witnessed at these anti-life rallies and what you've
[00:56:57.648 --> 00:57:02.648]   witnessed at the border and what you think is coming up with the election.
[00:57:02.648 --> 00:57:04.009]  Drew Hernandez is our guest.
[00:57:04.009 --> 00:57:06.269]  He'll be with us some of the next hour.
[00:57:06.269 --> 00:57:09.368]   And then we're going to open the phones up to balance the broadcast.
[00:57:09.368 --> 00:57:12.488]   The committee we had on family emergencies is going to come on next week.
[00:57:12.488 --> 00:57:13.488]  We totally understand.
[00:57:13.488 --> 00:57:18.569]   So we're going to have several hours of calls after Drew leaves us, at least an hour and
[00:57:18.569 --> 00:57:23.289]  calls and a bunch of news I haven't broken yet.
[00:57:21.419 --> 00:57:25.524]  Next hour, hour number two with Drew Hernandez, just a wonderful guy.
[00:57:25.785 --> 00:57:32.053]  And I'm going to tell the story next hour when we talk about this, but I get really upset looking at the people that serve Satan, how they're like mutants.
[00:57:32.714 --> 00:57:38.319]  I get very depressed about it, but then God says to me, look at all the great people you get to know who are on the other side, who are awake.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:44.985]  And when you know people that know God and know justice, they're just alive and beautiful and smart and articulate.
[00:57:45.005 --> 00:57:47.087]  You see the people that aren't, they're dead inside.
[00:57:47.167 --> 00:57:49.167]  You can see the choice needs to be made.
[00:57:49.167 --> 00:57:59.167]  [MUSIC]
[00:57:59.167 --> 00:58:00.926]  History's happening now.
[00:58:00.959 --> 00:58:04.982]  The globalists are destroying our freedoms today, but humanity's waking up.

[00:59:45.762 --> 01:00:01.003]  Thank you.
[01:00:01.003 --> 01:00:24.164]  Thank you.
[01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:29.784]  If you've got more than three cats and an NPR tote bag and wear a mask alone in the car, you are all in.
[01:00:30.385 --> 01:00:31.886]  Everyone else is running away.
[01:00:32.806 --> 01:00:36.809]  Effectively, what we're seeing is the end of the modern Democratic Party.
[01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:38.871]  Even MSNBC has noticed.
[01:00:39.867 --> 01:00:43.469]  This speaks to a story we've been talking about since the 2020 election.
[01:00:43.929 --> 01:00:58.958]  Specifically along the border, the Rio Grande Valley, South Texas, we have seen county after county, whether it's in this district or some of the districts to the west of it, where voters have moved 10, 20, 30, 40 points away from the Democrats and toward the Republicans.
[01:00:59.038 --> 01:01:06.742]  This district that Myra Flores won last night, Barack Obama got more than 60% of the vote here when he last ran in 2012.
[01:01:07.082 --> 01:01:10.044]   Hillary Clinton won this district, By 22 points.
[01:01:10.144 --> 01:01:11.665]  It's shifted that dramatically.
[01:01:11.705 --> 01:01:18.068]  Joe Biden carried it by 4 in 2020 and now in a special election, a Republican candidate has won it outright.
[01:01:19.749 --> 01:01:23.592]  Barack Obama got more than 60% of the vote in that district.
[01:01:23.872 --> 01:01:25.553]  Now, it's Republican.
[01:01:26.801 --> 01:01:27.963]  This is an historic moment.
[01:01:28.403 --> 01:01:30.926]  Joe Biden has destroyed the Democratic coalition.
[01:01:31.747 --> 01:01:38.735]  So the question is, since we have only two political parties, how are Republican leaders responding to this fact, to this opportunity?
[01:01:39.176 --> 01:01:41.178]  Are they making the case for a better way?
[01:01:41.478 --> 01:01:44.282]  Are they offering an alternative to what the Democrats have brought this country?
[01:01:45.447 --> 01:01:45.948]  No, they're not.
[01:01:46.728 --> 01:01:49.411]  They're doing something you never would have expected.
[01:01:49.951 --> 01:01:52.994]  Republican leaders are siding with Joe Biden.
[01:01:53.934 --> 01:02:01.941]  At the very moment that Joe Biden is at his weakest, months before a pivotal midterm election, Republicans are propping him up.
[01:02:02.102 --> 01:02:04.003]  They are saving Biden from himself.
[01:02:05.086 --> 01:02:12.335]  Since the day Biden was elected, Republicans in Washington have taken Biden's side on virtually every significant item in his policy agenda.
[01:02:12.836 --> 01:02:23.629]   That would include COVID restrictions, vaccine mandates, transgender ideology in schools, sanctions against China, the January 6th charade, free speech, Civil liberties.
[01:02:24.009 --> 01:02:25.810]  Spying by the intel agencies.
[01:02:26.090 --> 01:02:27.651]  Preserving the big tech monopolies.
[01:02:27.971 --> 01:02:30.793]  The anti-white race politics of CRT and Juneteenth.
[01:02:31.273 --> 01:02:33.134]  Border enforcement and energy policy.
[01:02:33.234 --> 01:02:36.596]  And above all, the administration's signature issue.
[01:02:36.776 --> 01:02:39.918]  It's lunatic and reckless support for the war on Ukraine.
[01:02:40.418 --> 01:02:41.459]  Republicans are all in.
[01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:42.940]  It's called Keeve now!
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.882]  That's the Republican message heading into the midterm elections.
[01:02:46.982 --> 01:02:47.783]  It's called Keeve!
[01:02:49.465 --> 01:02:51.466]  And by the way, this isn't just happening in Washington.
[01:02:52.167 --> 01:02:55.249]  It is endemic among the leaders of solidly Republican states.
[01:02:55.289 --> 01:02:59.032]  In fact, the more Republican the state, the more liberal the governor tends to be.
[01:02:59.712 --> 01:03:06.717]  The governor of Texas, which has some of the biggest oil and gas deposits in the world, has decided to build windmills that don't work.
[01:03:07.518 --> 01:03:15.704]  The governor of Utah, a state where Joe Biden got 37% of the vote, that governor begins conversations by announcing his preferred pronouns.
[01:03:16.264 --> 01:03:16.804]  He really does.
[01:03:17.225 --> 01:03:17.445]  Watch.
[01:03:18.536 --> 01:03:22.958]  Well, I thank you so much, Gabby, for that question.
[01:03:23.579 --> 01:03:26.060]  And my preferred pronouns are he, him, and his.
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:28.721]  So thank you for sharing yours with me.
[01:03:30.922 --> 01:03:32.983]  It goes on and on and on.
[01:03:33.483 --> 01:03:38.766]  The governor of South Dakota, where Joe Biden got 35% of the total vote less than two years ago.
[01:03:39.066 --> 01:03:42.848]  That governor tried to let female impersonators destroy women's sports in South Dakota.
[01:03:43.388 --> 01:03:46.750]  In Texas, both senators can't stop talking about how great Juneteenth is.
[01:03:48.106 --> 01:03:53.983]  In Arkansas, one of the most conservative states in the country, the governor supports the chemical castration of children.
[01:03:55.270 --> 01:04:03.437]  The most recent action of the General Assembly, while well intended, is off course and I must veto House Bill 1570.
[01:04:04.177 --> 01:04:12.404]  And just like that, a bill to restrict children under 18 from receiving chemical treatments or having surgery for gender reassignment has been stopped.
[01:04:12.464 --> 01:04:14.886]  The governor said this bill is government overreach.
[01:04:15.126 --> 01:04:23.693]  Interfering by the state in a parent, in a child, in a doctor-patient relationship did not make sense to me.
[01:04:25.455 --> 01:04:29.499]  When you vote Republican in Arkansas, you're voting for the castration of children.
[01:04:29.639 --> 01:04:33.602]  How many Republican voters in Arkansas knew that when they voted for their Republican governor?
[01:04:34.123 --> 01:04:34.783]  But it's everywhere.
[01:04:35.244 --> 01:04:42.991]  Apart from Governor Ron DeSantis in Florida, very few Republican officeholders are pushing back in any way against anything Joe Biden is doing.
[01:04:43.031 --> 01:04:45.633]  In fact, they're abetting what he's doing.
[01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:48.696]  Effectively, they're coming to Joe Biden's rescue.
[01:04:49.912 --> 01:04:50.854]  Why are they doing this?
[01:04:51.615 --> 01:04:52.837]  Why do you think they're doing it?
[01:04:53.398 --> 01:04:55.662]  Because fundamentally, they're on Joe Biden's side.
[01:04:56.143 --> 01:04:56.564]  That's right.
[01:04:56.584 --> 01:04:58.507]  Judge John Brown, come on, stay with us.
[01:05:02.501 --> 01:05:08.386]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[01:05:08.946 --> 01:05:12.309]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[01:05:13.189 --> 01:05:16.892]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[01:05:17.633 --> 01:05:19.895]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[01:05:20.575 --> 01:05:27.742]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[01:05:28.443 --> 01:05:33.168]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[01:05:33.929 --> 01:05:40.055]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[01:05:41.136 --> 01:05:50.826]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[01:05:51.407 --> 01:05:55.071]  Whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.

[01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:24.352]  And Judge Joe Brown, the balance of the hour.
[01:06:24.652 --> 01:06:26.113]  We already had him set up a few days ago.
[01:06:26.133 --> 01:06:29.014]  We're so glad he's here today with this big breaking news.
[01:06:29.054 --> 01:06:36.557]  But first, here's Biden just minutes ago giving a speech saying a constitutional right of Americans to kill their babies has been taken away.
[01:06:37.503 --> 01:06:46.987]  Today the Supreme Court of the United States expressly took away a constitutional right from the American people that it had already recognized.
[01:06:48.267 --> 01:06:50.708]  They didn't limit it, they simply took it away.
[01:06:50.728 --> 01:06:56.210]  That's never been done to a right so important to so many Americans.
[01:06:57.070 --> 01:06:57.770]  But they did it.
[01:06:59.151 --> 01:07:01.592]  It's a sad day for the court and for the country.
[01:07:04.585 --> 01:07:16.577]  So there's the KKK sympathizer that Judge Joe Brown witnessed as a young man say incredibly evil, hateful, discriminatory things up there as the president.
[01:07:17.719 --> 01:07:19.560]  Saying that a right has been taken away.
[01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:27.326]  We were going to get him on about, I saw him on one of our other shows did a great job, Harrison Smith's American Journal, last week.
[01:07:28.147 --> 01:07:32.169]  Laying out just how out of control this January 6th committee is.
[01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:38.914]  Swearing people in, but then editing videos and letting witnesses hear what witnesses had to say and so much more.
[01:07:38.934 --> 01:07:49.182]   He'll cover that later, but today the Supreme Court ruling on Roe v. Wade Yesterday's ruling on the Second Amendment saying New York and other states can't bar concealed carries.
[01:07:49.202 --> 01:07:51.424]  This is a big, big deal.
[01:07:51.544 --> 01:07:52.645]  What a historic moment.
[01:07:52.945 --> 01:07:54.046]  What is the aftermath?
[01:07:54.086 --> 01:07:54.967]  What does it really mean?
[01:07:55.327 --> 01:07:56.588]  What does he expect is about to happen?
[01:07:56.608 --> 01:08:01.332]  The left is already all over the news saying they're gonna peacefully burn down America this weekend.
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.421]  Judge Joe Brown, you've got the floor, my friend.
[01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:05.321]  Great to have you back.
[01:08:05.361 --> 01:08:06.081]  Great patriot.
[01:08:06.441 --> 01:08:12.023]  People can visit your website, thejudgejoebrownshow.com, on Twitter at Judge Joe Brown TV.
[01:08:12.984 --> 01:08:15.064]  I saw you on earlier this week with one of our crew.
[01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:16.045]  Amazing hour.
[01:08:16.405 --> 01:08:17.565]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[01:08:18.286 --> 01:08:21.387]  I could ask a lot of questions, but where do you want to go from what I just laid out?
[01:08:22.147 --> 01:08:34.489]   Okay, let's start off with New York's reaction, the city mayor's reaction to Uh, the ruling about the constitutional right to be armed in public.
[01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.009]  I think it is a good thing.
[01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:51.006]   But our lawless mayor gets up there and not our but the lawless mayor gets up there and he advocates right disobedience of A ruling by the U.S.
[01:08:51.066 --> 01:08:51.946]  Supreme Court.
[01:08:52.146 --> 01:09:04.052]  I wonder if these hypocrites on the clown show with the J6 committee would be interested in that because that sounds just like what they were accusing Mr. Trump of doing.
[01:09:04.853 --> 01:09:16.698]  I wonder if they want to pay attention to Joe Biden doing what he did today, which is inviting disobedience of the latest ruling by the U.S.
[01:09:16.759 --> 01:09:17.619]  Supreme Court.
[01:09:19.038 --> 01:09:29.741]  And their support for what is bound to be some riotous behavior in the streets by certain groups.
[01:09:29.821 --> 01:09:31.562]  This hypocrisy is awful.
[01:09:31.742 --> 01:09:41.545]  And then the thing that we hear about the Arkansas governor, which to me is right over the bridge here since I live in Memphis.
[01:09:42.605 --> 01:09:47.798]   It strikes me that Some things are being missed.
[01:09:47.938 --> 01:10:01.730]  If a child is injured in an accident, they have to get the parent or guardian in order to get permission to perform surgery on this child.
[01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:02.410]  All right?
[01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:08.935]  Unless it's a dire emergency and there's a cadre of doctors that go along with saying we have to.
[01:10:09.876 --> 01:10:15.761]  Well, why do we have this support for elective surgery, to put it crudely?
[01:10:16.408 --> 01:10:18.189]  And they're only 15 years old.
[01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:20.291]  That doesn't make any sense.
[01:10:20.371 --> 01:10:24.815]  And this whole position is based on some logical inconsistencies.
[01:10:25.795 --> 01:10:28.538]  And it just shows the hypocrisy of the left.
[01:10:29.719 --> 01:10:31.060]  They want what they want.
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:42.969]  They don't give a damn about anything else, any other considerations except their personal exercise of license rather than responsible exercise of rights.
[01:10:43.069 --> 01:10:51.692]   And this isn't a right because children Under the law are entitled to appropriate supervision.
[01:10:51.792 --> 01:10:55.136]  They are not adults and they cannot sign contracts.
[01:10:55.196 --> 01:11:11.953]   They cannot make binding agreements, but Having your genitals removed or your sex changed is certainly a binding contractual agreement between the child and somebody.
[01:11:12.233 --> 01:11:12.934]  Let me stop you.
[01:11:12.954 --> 01:11:15.837]  Some stations don't care that first five minutes for those who just joined us.
[01:11:16.698 --> 01:11:28.852]  Tucker Carlson clip I played, that little no man's land, first five minutes of some stations carry, some don't, was making the point that the Arkansas governor overrode and vetoed the legislature saying that we're not going to sterilize and cut the genitals off children.
[01:11:29.292 --> 01:11:40.414]   If you or I walked into a hospital today in Memphis, Tennessee or Austin, Texas or New York, New York or LA and said I want my arm cut off, They'd call a paddy wagon to take us to a mental institution.
[01:11:40.834 --> 01:11:53.005]  But if we want to, hell in Europe, it's as young as 7, here as young as 10, as you said the average age is 15, cut the penis and balls off a child, then we don't want the parents involved, the state said the kid wants to be another gender.
[01:11:53.685 --> 01:12:28.528]   It's about tacky because you know Arkansas is claiming parental rights in some cases the state's coming in and trying to override that so this is mental illness on its face being pushed by the state so what you're saying is out of the abortion out of the gun control rulings I agree with you this transgender movement is the next leg of what they're doing and it's just outrageous but again You're a judge, but am I not wrong that if I walked into a hospital and said I want you to cut my right leg off, they'd put me in a mental institution, but I say my right leg is not as important as my dick and balls, as you said, because that's how I make new people.
[01:12:28.768 --> 01:12:36.535]  That is a direct attack on my whole family line, who I am and everything, and I'd say before I wanted my testicles cut off, I'd rather have my leg cut off.
[01:12:37.799 --> 01:12:38.980]  Well, you're right.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.741]  It's an inconsistency.
[01:12:40.781 --> 01:12:41.802]  It's a hypocrisy.
[01:12:41.902 --> 01:12:51.750]  It's just a selfish focus on immediate hedonistic pleasure without any understanding or respect for the other issues that are brought up.
[01:12:52.831 --> 01:12:55.833]  I mean, what's more revocable than that?
[01:12:55.893 --> 01:12:57.374]  And then I tell a joke about it.
[01:12:57.434 --> 01:12:59.816]  What do you see whenever you see a human?
[01:13:01.478 --> 01:13:02.238]  A man or a woman?
[01:13:03.499 --> 01:13:05.721]  No, you see a successful screw.
[01:13:06.301 --> 01:13:11.771]   Somebody's Somebody is born, somebody matures after they get ready.
[01:13:11.811 --> 01:13:13.394]  That's right, sex did that.
[01:13:13.474 --> 01:13:14.195]  Sex did that.
[01:13:14.816 --> 01:13:18.343]  Yeah, they breathe, and then you get the next generation.
[01:13:18.403 --> 01:13:21.288]  So these folks want to cut it off because they can't handle it.
[01:13:22.128 --> 01:13:33.232]  It's just absolutely ridiculous, because even if the child is hurt in an accident, you have to get a hold of a parent or a guardian in order to get permission for life-saving surgery.
[01:13:33.332 --> 01:13:49.777]  So here is an elective for some reason that your child can't even fathom at that point, because remember, starting at eight, nine years old in this state, they were talking about having puberty blockers, so the person is never getting to the point where, hell, he's had a heart attack.
[01:13:50.177 --> 01:13:51.797]  Buy a pack of cigarettes or a gun.
[01:13:52.337 --> 01:13:55.418]  They can't join the military, but they can decide to have their balls cut off.
[01:13:56.378 --> 01:14:02.939]  Yeah, after they've been allowed to take puberty blockers so they don't even get their first heart on to find out what it's all about.
[01:14:03.399 --> 01:14:03.779]  Exactly.
[01:14:04.019 --> 01:14:04.759]  That's a good point.
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:07.880]  They don't want you to know that's going to be the best part of your life right there.
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:09.700]  They don't want you to ever even experience that.
[01:14:11.181 --> 01:14:13.781]  Well, see, there's another thing to it.
[01:14:14.361 --> 01:14:19.362]  Part of this whole thing with the tranny thing has got to do with the lifeboat situation.
[01:14:19.918 --> 01:14:26.921]  The next time a Titanic goes down with not enough lifeboats, the men are supposed to say, Ma'am, you may have my seat.
[01:14:27.001 --> 01:14:27.821]  You and your child.
[01:14:27.921 --> 01:14:29.922]  I'll drown with the ship when it goes down.
[01:14:30.282 --> 01:14:31.683]  See, that takes a whole lot.
[01:14:31.763 --> 01:14:34.524]  But a lot of punks don't have that kind of manliness.
[01:14:34.864 --> 01:14:38.285]  And they want to deal with, Oh, I got on a dress.
[01:14:38.485 --> 01:14:40.066]  I should be able to get in there.
[01:14:40.366 --> 01:14:48.489]  My position's been, no, grab them, snatch them, throw them on the other side of the ship and shun the sharks so the women and children get away safe.
[01:14:49.508 --> 01:14:51.469]  You know, that's an abdication.
[01:14:51.489 --> 01:14:51.789]  You're right.
[01:14:51.829 --> 01:14:58.213]  That's the perfect analogy of the lifeboats are here and there's a bunch of men in dresses trying to kick out the girls and women.
[01:14:59.694 --> 01:15:00.034]  Yes.
[01:15:00.995 --> 01:15:02.415]  See, we have this thing.
[01:15:02.636 --> 01:15:03.316]  I have a model.
[01:15:04.022 --> 01:15:07.804]  It's all about protecting womanhood and promoting manhood.
[01:15:07.904 --> 01:15:08.184]  Why?
[01:15:08.284 --> 01:15:09.985]  Because the women are a resource.
[01:15:10.165 --> 01:15:11.405]  They bear the children.
[01:15:11.425 --> 01:15:15.887]  A man can technically fertilize quite a few women at the same time.
[01:15:16.008 --> 01:15:22.691]  So we've always had this thing, when the population goes down, the more successful men, they get around.
[01:15:23.351 --> 01:15:27.793]  Now we have monogamy, but the men can procreate.
[01:15:27.873 --> 01:15:28.553]  They go off.
[01:15:28.613 --> 01:15:30.114]  We go off to the wars.
[01:15:30.254 --> 01:15:32.215]  We guard the front doors.
[01:15:33.281 --> 01:15:45.228]  We sacrifice ourselves to protect our wives and families and life goes on and your gene code gets continued because the mother birthed the children.
[01:15:45.368 --> 01:15:47.889]  She could have been pregnant when you lost your life.
[01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:49.810]  And it's what it is.
[01:15:49.951 --> 01:15:50.671]  Beautifully said.
[01:15:50.691 --> 01:15:51.311]  Stay there, sir.
[01:15:51.331 --> 01:15:56.034]  I want to come back at more into this Roe v. Wade, the gun amendment, what the left's going to do.
[01:15:56.054 --> 01:15:57.295]  Judge Joe Brown's our guest.
[01:15:57.315 --> 01:15:57.735]  Stay with us.
[01:16:01.371 --> 01:16:03.432]  Infowars is fighting for you.
[01:16:04.292 --> 01:16:07.834]  Infowars is fighting for every basic freedom we've got.
[01:16:08.694 --> 01:16:15.757]  We're Americans, and we are not going to see our birthright destroyed by the globalists and their quote, liberal world order.
[01:16:16.277 --> 01:16:31.484]   That means devalued currencies, open borders, the disarmament of the average person while the elites have private bodyguards, the incredible pedophilic sexualization of our children with the entire drag queen pedophile time, Being pushed by Disney, Hollywood, and the Democratic Party.
[01:16:32.104 --> 01:16:34.726]  We stand against the future lockdowns they're openly planning.
[01:16:34.766 --> 01:16:39.009]  We stand against their World ID cards from the Davos Group and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates.
[01:16:39.369 --> 01:16:43.792]  We stand against the forced injections with their deadly gene therapies.
[01:16:44.332 --> 01:16:46.453]  And more importantly, we don't just stand for those freedoms.
[01:16:46.934 --> 01:16:48.635]  We are the tip of the spear and we're winning.
[01:16:49.155 --> 01:16:55.919]   And that means when you support InfoWars by spreading the word or buying great products at infowarsstore.com, You are the tip of the spear.

[01:17:00.342 --> 01:17:01.203]  You are this fight.
[01:17:01.243 --> 01:17:02.444]  Without you, we would have already lost.
[01:17:02.924 --> 01:17:12.851]  And I want to ask you again to just think this July 4th about what America and the world would be like without you and your actions to fight tyranny and your support of InfoWars.

[01:17:34.969 --> 01:17:41.555]  This hair and beard formula that I designed, that I think is great, I think is amazing, this is something hardly anybody buys.
[01:17:42.316 --> 01:17:47.899]  Even though it's basically the same formula, maybe even better than our whole food multivitamin that is incredible.
[01:17:48.199 --> 01:17:50.080]  This is a whole food multivitamin mineral.

[01:18:30.838 --> 01:18:38.399]  [Music]
[01:18:38.379 --> 01:18:40.681]  If we're going down, we ain't going down without a fight.
[01:18:40.701 --> 01:18:41.682]  But we ain't going down.
[01:18:41.702 --> 01:18:43.243]  The globalists are going down, that's right.
[01:18:43.263 --> 01:18:45.886]  You can see into the future watching Alex Jones play.
[01:18:46.266 --> 01:18:47.127]  Alex Jones is right.
[01:18:47.187 --> 01:18:48.549]  Yeah, Alex Jones is right.
[01:18:48.569 --> 01:18:49.650]  Alex Jones is right.
[01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:51.251]  Yeah, Alex Jones is right.
[01:18:51.372 --> 01:18:52.192]  Alex Jones is right.
[01:18:52.252 --> 01:18:53.654]  Yeah, Alex Jones is right.
[01:18:53.674 --> 01:18:54.715]  Alex Jones is right.
[01:18:54.775 --> 01:18:56.136]  Yeah, Alex Jones is right.
[01:18:56.156 --> 01:18:57.758]  There's a war on for you, man.
[01:18:57.818 --> 01:18:58.559]  It's time to win it.
[01:19:01.491 --> 01:19:07.558]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria, or pump gas, or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[01:19:07.839 --> 01:19:11.103]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[01:19:11.123 --> 01:19:11.844]  You see it every year.
[01:19:11.864 --> 01:19:14.206]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[01:19:14.967 --> 01:19:16.689]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[01:19:17.310 --> 01:19:27.377]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[01:19:27.417 --> 01:19:38.664]  So, it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody, to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful, that allows you to keep more of your money.
[01:19:38.704 --> 01:19:42.907]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[01:19:44.147 --> 01:19:49.151]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:19:49.371 --> 01:19:51.814]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com, or call 833-900-4285.
[01:19:51.834 --> 01:19:51.934]  833-900-4285.
[01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:58.753]  833-900-4285. 833-900-4285.
[01:19:58.753 --> 01:20:09.753]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:10.753 --> 01:20:23.753]  [Music]
[01:20:24.172 --> 01:20:30.094]  There's blood on the street, it's up to my ankles.
[01:20:30.134 --> 01:20:35.175]  There's blood on the street, it's up to my knees.
[01:20:35.335 --> 01:20:39.497]  There's blood on the street, the town of Chicago.
[01:20:43.420 --> 01:20:45.782]  Judge Joe Brown is a really articulate, smart guy.
[01:20:45.822 --> 01:20:46.683]  I really admire him.
[01:20:47.063 --> 01:20:48.325]  I'm honored that he's a friend.
[01:20:48.345 --> 01:20:53.650]  And I could ask a thousand questions for the rest of the hour trying to give him the floor to go where he wants, but let me ask him this.
[01:20:54.371 --> 01:20:57.394]  Where is America in the world right now?
[01:20:57.514 --> 01:21:00.997]  How would you describe the historic point we're at?
[01:21:01.017 --> 01:21:04.240]  Because you have a great historical, I've had dinner with you, talked to you a lot.
[01:21:04.941 --> 01:21:05.882]  And I've done a lot of history.
[01:21:05.902 --> 01:21:06.702]  You know more than I do.
[01:21:06.722 --> 01:21:08.303]  I've been blown away by your knowledge.
[01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:09.143]  It's true, folks.
[01:21:09.484 --> 01:21:10.424]  One of the smartest people I know.
[01:21:11.065 --> 01:21:12.425]  What is the moment we're at?
[01:21:12.505 --> 01:21:14.647]  What is the choice humanity has?
[01:21:14.687 --> 01:21:18.309]  Because the left is just running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[01:21:18.369 --> 01:21:19.329]  What's their problem?
[01:21:19.349 --> 01:21:20.490]  Why don't they want success?
[01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:22.071]  Why don't they want order?
[01:21:22.151 --> 01:21:23.311]  Why don't they want freedom?
[01:21:23.632 --> 01:21:25.853]  True liberalism, which means freedom.
[01:21:26.473 --> 01:21:27.354]  They're not the liberals.
[01:21:27.394 --> 01:21:29.375]  To me, they're the authoritarians.
[01:21:29.395 --> 01:21:32.897]  How would you quantify, Judge Brown, where we are today?
[01:21:35.418 --> 01:21:41.020]  Fifty-five years ago, I had a course.
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:49.543]  It was a visiting professor, and the professor said America is in grave danger of becoming a fascist country.
[01:21:50.283 --> 01:22:00.386]  Not from some jack-booted, goose-stepping thugs, but from, as she turned, some pink-panty-wearing, long-haired hippies.
[01:22:01.354 --> 01:22:09.747]  Who would be glad to impose the worst methods of fascism on everybody for their own perceived good.
[01:22:10.468 --> 01:22:11.570]  And that's what we're getting.
[01:22:15.456 --> 01:22:20.219]  What you're looking at is essentially an episode of two things.
[01:22:20.679 --> 01:22:32.506]  One, to make it real simple, Reed Orwell's Animal Farm, where the animals staged a revolution and took over a farm, and they had a constitution written on the side of a barn that said all animals are equal.
[01:22:33.267 --> 01:22:39.691]  And then the pigs wound up pulling off a lot of stunts and taking some power, and the constitution changed.
[01:22:39.811 --> 01:22:41.492]  It said all animals are equal.
[01:22:42.952 --> 01:22:47.074]  But pigs are more equal than others and that's what we have right now.
[01:22:47.174 --> 01:22:51.115]  We've got a pig pen developing and there you go.
[01:22:51.175 --> 01:22:56.998]  That was put out by the CIA in 1952 to show in Europe.
[01:22:57.158 --> 01:23:06.982]  So what you have is a pig pen where we have a new category of pigs who are more equal than others.
[01:23:08.414 --> 01:23:13.378]  One of the things that I find absolutely astonishing is this sense of entitlement.
[01:23:14.619 --> 01:23:24.366]  Wherein people say, I wish upon a star, makes no difference who I am, my dreams should come true.
[01:23:24.507 --> 01:23:27.469]  You know, makes no difference who you are, your dreams will come true.
[01:23:27.509 --> 01:23:29.110]  That's Walt Disney nonsense.
[01:23:29.631 --> 01:23:41.349]   And he'd been fed a 50-some year Course of intense propaganda from Hollywood and other sources that all you have to do is want and you should have.
[01:23:41.690 --> 01:23:44.951]  You see mothers that can barely pay the rent.
[01:23:45.031 --> 01:23:53.576]  They get a little in their hand and they go out and buy their nine-year-old a $260 pair of Air Jordan tennis shoes.
[01:23:53.736 --> 01:23:57.158]  These kind of things where I want it so I should get it.
[01:23:58.464 --> 01:24:08.489]  It's not necessary to go off and do all of these difficult things that are required becoming a human who is a free human.
[01:24:08.789 --> 01:24:10.190]  We should be entitled to it.
[01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:18.874]  And what I see is history repeating itself, only this time it's United States of America instead of Great Britain.
[01:24:19.094 --> 01:24:27.178]  Because if you look back to the 1920s, you will see Great Britain just came out of the Great War.
[01:24:29.075 --> 01:24:48.067]  And they had this thing about social programs, and they bankrupted themselves, and by the end of World War II, which was just 20-some years away, Great Britain quickly fell into being a third-rate, not even second-rate power, and the United States took its position.
[01:24:48.707 --> 01:25:00.392]   Now, Pakistan and India are much more powerful militarily, economically, Scientifically and industrially than Great Britain used to be.
[01:25:00.472 --> 01:25:14.646]  So instead of Britannia ruling the waves and the Royal Navy controlling who moved on over or under the oceans, now they can't even man all their ships and what do they have?
[01:25:14.906 --> 01:25:17.308]  So Judge Brown, let me ask you this question is where you're going.
[01:25:17.709 --> 01:25:19.691]  Why do empires commit suicide?
[01:25:20.888 --> 01:25:23.930]  Because they get too indulgent.
[01:25:24.270 --> 01:25:27.913]  They get decadent, degenerate, and depraved.
[01:25:28.193 --> 01:25:31.976]  They get more in love with their luxuries than they do with their freedom.
[01:25:32.736 --> 01:25:40.722]  And they're willing to be safe, excuse me, they're willing to give up their freedom to be safe and to ensure their luxury.
[01:25:41.212 --> 01:25:53.439]  Now you mentioned this, Biden to remove Title IX for women's rights, which I support women's rights, in favor of gender identity, letting men, like you said, on the Titanic, come in and take over.
[01:25:53.479 --> 01:25:54.479]  That is crazy.
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:03.324]  Well, yeah, it's like, see, one thing, I think there is a need for one constitutional amendment, just one.
[01:26:04.245 --> 01:26:14.029]   And that one would read something like the The body of a bill or piece of legislation has to reflect the caption.
[01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:18.712]  They introduced the Emmett Till Anti-Lynch Bill.
[01:26:19.352 --> 01:26:35.623]  Let's not go into all of the details, but they added something which is gender orientation to the American legal lexicon or federal lexicon for the first time.
[01:26:36.849 --> 01:26:43.011]  That came in under a so-called anti-lynch bill, but it applies now to all American law.
[01:26:43.131 --> 01:26:45.751]  So what the hell do you mean by that?
[01:26:46.331 --> 01:26:59.675]  You have ordinarily, you can't discriminate against anyone because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, medical condition.
[01:27:01.967 --> 01:27:09.652]  And what we have now is a different kind of thing, where somebody says, I have an extra choice I can make.
[01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:18.838]  I can be lying through my teeth, but if I'm punk enough to go out and say, oh, I'm a sissy, then I can get declared to be a woman.
[01:27:19.278 --> 01:27:31.662]   I might not be able to make the varsity, so instead of sitting in the stands and cheering like everybody else who can't, I get to go declare that I've got Girl in me and put on a skirt.
[01:27:31.742 --> 01:27:39.988]  No, I want to be a girl and all this and I can go out and play with the girls and we even violate some old precepts like.
[01:27:40.929 --> 01:27:44.632]  Boys are stronger than girls, therefore boys should never hit girl.
[01:27:45.232 --> 01:27:49.135]  So now we have little honks out there in full contact sports.
[01:27:49.574 --> 01:27:52.635]  Crippling, maiming, and badly hurting.
[01:27:52.655 --> 01:27:57.938]  We have UFC fighters killing women, men killing women, fighting women.
[01:27:58.778 --> 01:28:02.880]  Imagine if Mike Tyson was in the ring with a woman, we would say arrest him.
[01:28:02.900 --> 01:28:04.681]  But oh, if he saves a woman, it's okay.
[01:28:06.141 --> 01:28:08.142]  Well, this is personal to me.
[01:28:08.262 --> 01:28:18.818]   Not long ago, I was in the parking lot of, well, one of these discount Hardware store.
[01:28:19.278 --> 01:28:20.460]  I think it was Lowe's.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.843]  And this beautiful woman said, Uncle Joe.
[01:28:24.243 --> 01:28:27.046]  And I looked over and I didn't recognize her at first.
[01:28:27.146 --> 01:28:31.329]  And then when I did, I said, baby, what what happened to your arm?
[01:28:31.369 --> 01:28:38.085]   She had her arm up and a And the contrivance around her waist to keep it up.
[01:28:38.585 --> 01:28:44.349]  And I hadn't seen her since she had been 11 or 12, but her grandfather would always talk to me about her.
[01:28:44.389 --> 01:28:46.950]  She'd been a martial artist since she'd been 8 years old.
[01:28:47.010 --> 01:28:47.351]  Hold on!
[01:28:47.591 --> 01:28:48.631]  Judge Joe Brown, stay there.
[01:28:48.672 --> 01:28:50.453]  Tell us the story when we come back.
[01:28:50.553 --> 01:28:52.594]  Judge Joe Brown is our guest.
[01:28:52.674 --> 01:28:53.434]  Amazing guest.
[01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:55.035]  Have on, stay with us.
[01:28:55.095 --> 01:28:56.957]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Judge Joe Brown Show.com.
[01:29:00.384 --> 01:29:04.666]  You know, respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy.
[01:29:05.426 --> 01:29:07.707]  Even when we find those results hard to accept.
[01:29:07.927 --> 01:29:15.470]  You can run the best campaign, you can even become the nominee, and you can have the election stolen from you.
[01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:17.190]  Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016.
[01:29:17.230 --> 01:29:22.873]  He lost the election, and he was put in the office because the Russians interfered.
[01:29:23.033 --> 01:29:25.093]  Trump knows he's an illegitimate president.
[01:29:25.173 --> 01:29:28.135]  The president, although legally elected, is not legitimate.
[01:29:28.195 --> 01:29:28.715]  I don't see this.
[01:29:29.867 --> 01:29:32.931]  President-elect as a legitimate president.
[01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:37.478]  You said you believe that Russia's interference altered the outcome of the election.
[01:29:37.838 --> 01:29:38.139]  I do.
[01:29:38.279 --> 01:29:39.220]  I have an objection.
[01:29:39.421 --> 01:29:41.984]  I object to the 15 votes from the state of North Carolina.
[01:29:42.084 --> 01:29:44.107]  I object because people are horrified.
[01:29:44.167 --> 01:29:45.369]  He's an illegitimate president.
[01:29:45.469 --> 01:29:50.713]  What I believe is that there's no question that the outcome of this election was affected by the Russian interference.
[01:29:50.853 --> 01:29:53.474]  There absolutely is a cloud of illegitimacy.
[01:29:53.514 --> 01:29:55.356]  So that legitimacy is a question, yes.
[01:29:55.456 --> 01:29:59.278]  So that was a very tainted election, and in that sense, it's illegitimate.
[01:29:59.338 --> 01:30:01.340]  He knows he's an illegitimate president.
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:03.101]  Actually, I think I carried Florida.
[01:30:03.301 --> 01:30:04.902]  Bush versus Gore.
[01:30:05.582 --> 01:30:09.145]  A court took away a presidency.
[01:30:09.225 --> 01:30:11.186]  We actually won the last presidential election, folks.
[01:30:11.206 --> 01:30:12.587]  They stole the last presidential election.
[01:30:14.514 --> 01:30:21.598]  I'm from Florida, where you and others participated in what I call the United States coup d'état.
[01:30:21.698 --> 01:30:24.620]  There's no doubt in my mind that Al Gore was elected president.
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.822]  I rise to object to the fraudulent 25 Florida electoral votes.
[01:30:29.082 --> 01:30:32.724]  I must object because of the overwhelming evidence of official misconduct.
[01:30:35.049 --> 01:30:45.798]  It is signed by myself on behalf of my diverse constituents and the millions of Americans who have been disenfranchised by Florida's inaccurate vote count.
[01:30:45.818 --> 01:30:54.386]  By the time it was over, our candidate had won the popular vote, and the only way they could win the election was to stop the voting in Florida.
[01:30:56.079 --> 01:31:03.079]   Bush, Jim Baker, and the Supreme Court hadn't tampered with the results, Al Gore would be
[01:31:03.079 --> 01:31:11.079]   president. The Supreme Court selected George W. Bush as the president. He was not elected.
[01:31:11.079 --> 01:31:17.079]   There is overwhelming evidence that George W. Bush did not win this election. What I
[01:31:17.079 --> 01:31:24.079]   observed as a voter, as a citizen of Illinois four years ago, were troubling evidence of
[01:31:24.079 --> 01:31:31.079]   the fact that not every vote was being counted. Constantly shifting vote tallies in Ohio.
[01:31:31.147 --> 01:31:40.532]  And malfunctioning electronic machines, which may not have paper receipts, have led to additional loss of confidence by the public.
[01:31:40.612 --> 01:31:43.534]  The right to vote has been stolen from qualified voters.
[01:31:43.574 --> 01:31:48.937]  The 2004 presidential election in Ohio was riddled with unnecessary problems.
[01:31:49.057 --> 01:31:52.219]  Some machines malfunctioned, causing votes to be counted more than once.
[01:31:52.919 --> 01:31:53.500]  Or not at all.
[01:31:53.660 --> 01:32:06.170]  Based upon an inordinate number of allegations suggesting gross voting rights violations and misconduct, I join with my colleagues in objecting to counting the state of Ohio's electoral votes.
[01:32:06.370 --> 01:32:10.414]  I agree with tens of billions of Americans who are very worried.
[01:32:10.874 --> 01:32:15.777]  There must be independent testing of the voting machines used in Ohio.
[01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:20.036]  There is no paper trail to record that vote.
[01:32:20.036 --> 01:32:23.435]   There must be independent testing of the voting machines used in Ohio.
[01:32:23.435 --> 01:32:29.916]   Without voter suppression, Stacey Abrams would be the governor of Georgia.
[01:32:30.294 --> 01:32:30.735]  We won!
[01:32:31.175 --> 01:32:34.496]  Andrew Gillum is the governor of Florida.
[01:32:34.656 --> 01:32:37.097]  If Stacey Abrams doesn't win in Georgia, they stole it.
[01:32:37.257 --> 01:32:37.737]  It's clear.
[01:32:38.037 --> 01:32:38.477]  It's clear.
[01:32:38.597 --> 01:32:41.218]  I think that Stacey Abrams' election is being stolen from her.
[01:32:41.839 --> 01:32:45.980]  I'll need an effective strategy to mobilize true international pressure.
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.421]  What kind of country are we going to be?
[01:32:48.001 --> 01:32:49.662]  Four more years of Georgia.
[01:32:50.162 --> 01:32:50.542]  Thank you!
[01:32:53.623 --> 01:32:57.623]  Watch the full video right now at BAM.video.
[01:32:57.623 --> 01:33:08.623]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.623 --> 01:33:21.623]  [Music]
[01:33:21.503 --> 01:33:28.503]   Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.503 --> 01:33:42.503]  So, Judge Joe Brown, who just joined us, was talking about...
[01:33:42.503 --> 01:33:44.063]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:33:43.897 --> 01:33:48.126]  Women being beaten half to death, in some cases to death, by men.
[01:33:48.467 --> 01:33:54.178]  And men-women cycling contest, and track and field contest, and swimming contest.
[01:33:55.987 --> 01:33:57.848]  They can sell that lie.
[01:33:57.888 --> 01:33:58.788]  They can sell anything.
[01:33:58.848 --> 01:34:00.188]  It's a war against logic.
[01:34:00.208 --> 01:34:06.350]  So you were getting into that and finishing up with a story you told about a woman you met in a parking lot that you've known for a long time.
[01:34:06.390 --> 01:34:07.230]  You'd forgotten about them.
[01:34:07.630 --> 01:34:08.490]  You're obviously a celebrity.
[01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:09.551]  You don't meet a lot of people.
[01:34:10.151 --> 01:34:11.331]  Then I want to ask you the big picture.
[01:34:11.511 --> 01:34:15.212]  What do we do, Judge Joe Brown, about this assault?
[01:34:15.292 --> 01:34:17.693]  What does the average person listening do to counter that?
[01:34:17.713 --> 01:34:18.293]  Please continue.
[01:34:19.264 --> 01:34:20.524]  Well, let me tell you the story.
[01:34:20.944 --> 01:34:23.625]  I hadn't seen her since she'd been about 11 years old.
[01:34:23.705 --> 01:34:23.985]  She was 19.
[01:34:24.666 --> 01:34:27.086]  She grew up beautiful, movie star beautiful.
[01:34:27.206 --> 01:34:31.687]  But she had her arm in a cast and it was propped up, shoulder too.
[01:34:32.448 --> 01:34:33.408]  And I asked her what happened.
[01:34:33.728 --> 01:34:40.850]  She had been a martial artist since she'd been eight or nine years old and she got a scholarship to a major university doing women's wrestling.
[01:34:41.809 --> 01:34:50.472]  Well, right before COVID hit hard, she had been in a tournament and she was set up to wrestle this, what turned out to be a guy.
[01:34:50.552 --> 01:34:51.412]  She refused.
[01:34:51.872 --> 01:34:53.832]  And so did another member of her team.
[01:34:53.893 --> 01:34:57.834]  And they were told they would lose their scholarships and the team would forfeit if they didn't.
[01:34:58.634 --> 01:35:02.535]  So the other woman got a broken jaw and put in a coma for three days.
[01:35:02.775 --> 01:35:09.197]  And my friend's granddaughter got a compound fracture of her arm that this creep did to her.
[01:35:10.242 --> 01:35:19.026]  And she was crying to me, crying on my shoulder, literally, about she had to go through three surgeries, how badly it hurt, and that she couldn't stand the pain.
[01:35:19.066 --> 01:35:22.968]  But when she took the medication, she couldn't focus on her studies.
[01:35:23.048 --> 01:35:24.209]  What was she going to do?
[01:35:24.269 --> 01:35:25.469]  And it just wasn't fair.
[01:35:25.529 --> 01:35:26.490]  Well, it wasn't.
[01:35:27.190 --> 01:35:31.572]  And these dirty creeps don't need to be allowed to compete against women.
[01:35:31.672 --> 01:35:32.453]  They're sissies.
[01:35:32.813 --> 01:35:33.553]  They're punks.
[01:35:33.913 --> 01:35:39.556]  They need to sit in the damn bleachers like everybody else who can't make the men's team.
[01:35:40.752 --> 01:35:43.293]  And this is just absolutely absurd.
[01:35:44.633 --> 01:35:47.834]  It is absolutely unfair and it is dangerous.
[01:35:48.714 --> 01:36:03.759]  Now women have fought long and hard to get equality in sports and it doesn't make any damn sense to allow some creep who ought to be ashamed of himself to come in and claim to be a girl and compete against the girls.
[01:36:05.023 --> 01:36:12.485]  So, it's particularly repugnant and I commend all state legislative bodies that are doing something about it.
[01:36:12.585 --> 01:36:16.366]  Hell, I saw a thing somebody called me up about just this week.
[01:36:16.406 --> 01:36:25.708]  They had Bruce Jenner on there and he was talking about he thought it was unfair for guys to be allowed to compete against girls in women's sports.
[01:36:27.668 --> 01:36:34.610]  And that's from a former male Olympic athlete who gold medaled a time or two in, what was it, swimming?
[01:36:35.908 --> 01:36:41.653]  So it's gotten really far out of hand, and we need to bring that back into focus.
[01:36:41.873 --> 01:36:46.737]  You know, just because you want something doesn't mean you should be able to get it.
[01:36:46.757 --> 01:36:50.320]  Yeah, just because you say you're an Easter Bunny doesn't make it so, or Santa Claus.
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:53.622]  So how do we counter this madness, Judge Brown?
[01:36:54.863 --> 01:36:55.544]  I can fly.
[01:36:55.604 --> 01:36:58.906]  Well, go jump off that eight-story building if you can fly then.
[01:37:00.408 --> 01:37:01.809]  So how do we counter this madness?
[01:37:01.829 --> 01:37:03.070]  Where do you see America going?
[01:37:04.212 --> 01:37:06.113]  Speaking of which, you're blind.
[01:37:06.173 --> 01:37:07.413]  You can't drive a car.
[01:37:08.274 --> 01:37:13.656]  I imagine there are a lot of blind people who would love to operate a car, but they can't because they can't see.
[01:37:15.357 --> 01:37:17.357]  So, what are you supposed to do?
[01:37:17.377 --> 01:37:18.198]  Well, it's the same thing.
[01:37:18.218 --> 01:37:21.759]  I mean, I can fight, but I couldn't be a heavyweight boxer and get my ass kicked.
[01:37:21.779 --> 01:37:26.021]  Those are professionals, the top 1-10th of 1% who train their whole lives.
[01:37:26.421 --> 01:37:29.142]  The idea that I can be a marathon runner, I can run 2 miles, I can't run 23.
[01:37:29.242 --> 01:37:31.403]  It's just so simple.
[01:37:31.523 --> 01:37:33.044]  I mean, it's right there.
[01:37:34.261 --> 01:37:36.222]  Well, let me bring us back to another thing.
[01:37:36.402 --> 01:37:36.782]  All right.
[01:37:36.802 --> 01:37:39.504]  This bit about protecting everyone.
[01:37:39.564 --> 01:37:40.164]  Oh, my God.
[01:37:40.224 --> 01:37:41.465]  We're going to end the violence.
[01:37:41.525 --> 01:37:43.546]  We're going to have rules against guns.
[01:37:43.646 --> 01:37:44.307]  Well, OK.
[01:37:44.347 --> 01:37:49.810]  They keep talking about assault rifles and what they're talking about a generally just Sam out.
[01:37:49.890 --> 01:37:50.530]  And let's see.
[01:37:51.171 --> 01:37:51.751]  Interesting.
[01:37:51.911 --> 01:37:54.793]  An anniversary passed three months ago.
[01:37:55.433 --> 01:37:56.374]  The A.R.
[01:37:56.274 --> 01:38:07.633]   which stands for Armolite Design of Stoner, Eugene Stoner who designed it, was patented
[01:38:07.633 --> 01:38:11.873]  70 years ago this year in February.
[01:38:12.573 --> 01:38:14.673]  So this is not something new.
[01:38:14.693 --> 01:38:15.794]  This is an antique.
[01:38:15.874 --> 01:38:17.094]  AK-47 was adopted 75 years ago in 1947.
[01:38:16.934 --> 01:38:21.934]  was adopted 75 years ago in 1947.
[01:38:21.934 --> 01:38:24.494]  So this is nothing new.
[01:38:24.494 --> 01:38:29.494]   We have some antique firearms and what people are putting out there
[01:38:29.494 --> 01:38:32.814]  with false propaganda is that they're assault rifle.
[01:38:32.944 --> 01:38:33.685]  No, they're not.
[01:38:34.325 --> 01:38:38.367]  A real assault rifle is a fully automatic weapon, a machine gun.
[01:38:38.787 --> 01:38:46.711]  You know, like Al Capone and Elliot Ness, or whatever you may have.
[01:38:47.672 --> 01:38:53.515]  Or John Wayne charging a machine gun nest with his Thompson, or whatever it may be.
[01:38:54.489 --> 01:38:57.210]  So, that isn't even the issue.
[01:38:57.450 --> 01:39:19.397]  In Switzerland, every able-bodied man from 17 to 56 is required to have a military-grade 9mm pistol in his possession, and a machine gun, a fully automatic, a real one, and two hand grenades and various and sundry rounds of ammunition.
[01:39:20.029 --> 01:39:26.534]  But they don't have any of these crazed fools running around killing folk off in mass.
[01:39:26.614 --> 01:39:37.602]  Now, every now and then, it seems a banker or two over in Switzerland had to get his drugs, and one or two of them might get off by somebody that came in from out of the country.
[01:39:38.102 --> 01:39:40.284]  But that kind of violent crime is zero.
[01:39:40.604 --> 01:39:41.645]  And it brings it to me.
[01:39:41.705 --> 01:39:54.354]   Now, I'm 74 years old, but I've been taking martial arts for 55 years, and myself and some of my associates, we can kill most humans who are comparably trained very quickly.
[01:39:54.894 --> 01:39:57.876]  A lot quicker than we could kill them with a pistol or a firearm.
[01:39:58.737 --> 01:40:00.778]  Or an AR, which is only a .
[01:40:00.819 --> 01:40:00.778]  .
[01:40:00.839 --> 01:40:01.519]  .
[01:40:01.119 --> 01:40:01.519]  Exactly.
[01:40:01.639 --> 01:40:03.500]  So we want to punish criminals, not the general public.
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:04.421]  Let me ask this question then.
[01:40:05.222 --> 01:40:06.302]  How do we fix this?
[01:40:06.743 --> 01:40:07.483]  An awakening?
[01:40:07.623 --> 01:40:08.304]  Education?
[01:40:08.384 --> 01:40:10.946]  I mean, it seems like America's going over a cliff.
[01:40:12.479 --> 01:40:22.282]  It's we're going over a cliff because we've attempted to emasculate the country in favor of these people who want to let children at 15 cut the dicks and balls off.
[01:40:22.462 --> 01:40:25.824]  So stop letting the left bully us and stop laying down the answer.
[01:40:26.804 --> 01:40:27.064]  Yeah.
[01:40:27.204 --> 01:40:28.104]  Well, yeah.
[01:40:28.324 --> 01:40:31.165]  And the other thing is, is let's take this thing about bullying.
[01:40:31.285 --> 01:40:32.826]  Look at back to the future.
[01:40:32.926 --> 01:40:39.070]   Back in the 1980s, McFly goes back Talked his father into standing up for himself.
[01:40:39.130 --> 01:40:42.131]  Dad busts the bully in his mouth, knocks him out.
[01:40:42.271 --> 01:40:49.476]  When young McFly gets back, the bully works for his dad instead of running roughshod over him.
[01:40:49.516 --> 01:40:58.941]  We've always had this thing in human society of boys becoming men had to learn up and stand up and screw up.
[01:40:58.961 --> 01:40:59.261]  That's right.
[01:40:59.281 --> 01:41:01.042]  They don't want us going through that process.
[01:41:01.242 --> 01:41:02.163]  They're really afraid of men.
[01:41:03.447 --> 01:41:04.829]  Yeah, they don't like it.
[01:41:04.929 --> 01:41:08.795]  So we have had a 55-year campaign to emasculate the country.
[01:41:09.236 --> 01:41:13.583]  I heard this starting back in the mid-60s when I was at UCLA as an undergrad.
[01:41:14.736 --> 01:41:42.654]   You had the lesbians who hated men, the feminists who hated that they weren't men, the beta boys that hated that they couldn't be real men, the gay folk that didn't understand being a man, and then you got that anti-war crowd in there that said war is a man thing, so if we raise boys like girls so they are emotional and they Uh, cry and shout and let it all hang out.
[01:41:42.754 --> 01:41:50.297]  Hey, man, if you cry and shout and let it all hang out instead of being so uptight, man, we would stop war, man.
[01:41:50.917 --> 01:42:00.045]   So, you got all of these together and they've started to try to and to an extent Accomplish the emasculation of the country.
[01:42:00.105 --> 01:42:11.875]  Meanwhile, January 21st, 2021, the Chinese government put in place an official man up campaign and Russia's already had one in about 10, 12, 15 years ago.
[01:42:12.616 --> 01:42:19.842]  They banned Americans from adopting Russian orphans because they did not want them turned to the dark side.
[01:42:20.162 --> 01:42:22.644]  I'm not talking about gay folk per se.
[01:42:23.584 --> 01:42:27.188]  I mean, if you want to get your freak on in your bedroom, that's your damn business.
[01:42:27.248 --> 01:42:31.973]  What I'm talking about is the LGBTQ cult, the rainbow cult.
[01:42:32.554 --> 01:42:43.886]  Now, Judaism, Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Confucianism, Buddhism, they're all religions, but the last two don't have a God.
[01:42:44.266 --> 01:42:45.788]  They are systems of philosophy.
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:50.762]  So if you look at LGBTQ the cult that way, you'll see what I'm talking about.
[01:42:51.162 --> 01:42:52.102]  Judge Brown, stay there.
[01:42:52.142 --> 01:42:54.003]  I want to talk about January 6th Committee.
[01:42:54.403 --> 01:42:56.304]  I want to talk about the election.
[01:42:56.584 --> 01:42:57.184]  So much more.
[01:42:57.244 --> 01:42:57.684]  Stay with us.
[01:43:00.645 --> 01:43:02.446]  All you have to do is check out what I'm saying.
[01:43:02.706 --> 01:43:08.788]  And that's why they run the fake headline against myself and Tucker Carlson everywhere, every day.
[01:43:09.608 --> 01:43:11.249]  Jones admits he's an actor.
[01:43:12.129 --> 01:43:14.470]  Or Tucker Carlson says nobody would take me seriously.
[01:43:15.765 --> 01:43:16.546]  Where do we say that?
[01:43:16.826 --> 01:43:17.546]  We never said that.
[01:43:17.607 --> 01:43:19.968]  They just say we said that.
[01:43:21.169 --> 01:43:21.970]  But where's the clip?
[01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:23.071]  Where's the article?
[01:43:23.371 --> 01:43:24.092]  Where do we say that?
[01:43:24.112 --> 01:43:25.173]  It doesn't exist.
[01:43:25.733 --> 01:43:29.796]  Alex Jones is playing a character and is a performance artist.
[01:43:30.157 --> 01:43:33.059]  Jones is playing a character on his radio show.
[01:43:33.239 --> 01:43:37.342]  The radio rants of Alex Jones are just an act.
[01:43:37.763 --> 01:43:39.664]  He's actually a performance artist.
[01:43:39.885 --> 01:43:41.166]  He's a performance artist.
[01:43:41.526 --> 01:43:42.687]  Alex Jones is a fake.
[01:43:43.354 --> 01:43:46.936]  They're lying to you because they think you're stupid.
[01:43:46.977 --> 01:43:51.740]  And it's all based on a custody battle with my ex-wife five years ago.
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:59.565]  And she was trying to put into evidence me dressed up more than a decade before, like the Joker, being sarcastic, saying, take your Prozac, kids.
[01:43:59.625 --> 01:44:00.926]  Take your illegal drugs, too.
[01:44:01.306 --> 01:44:01.947]  You'll die.
[01:44:02.007 --> 01:44:02.547]  It's fun.
[01:44:02.947 --> 01:44:04.628]  So people wouldn't take drugs.
[01:44:05.709 --> 01:44:09.152]  And they wanted to enter that in evidence and say, look, he's insane, telling kids to use drugs.
[01:44:09.752 --> 01:44:15.996]  And my lawyer went, when Jack Nicholson plays the part of the Joker, no one thinks that's really Jack Nicholson.
[01:44:16.016 --> 01:44:18.278]  So yeah, when I've been Cobra Commander.
[01:44:18.678 --> 01:44:19.859]  Hail Cobra!
[01:44:20.179 --> 01:44:21.080]  Or Optimus Prime.
[01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:23.061]  Autobots, let's roll!
[01:44:23.362 --> 01:44:25.943]  Or the Joker, because I can do imitations of them all really good.
[01:44:26.424 --> 01:44:27.124]  Or Darth Vader.
[01:44:27.324 --> 01:44:29.566]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[01:44:30.427 --> 01:44:33.509]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:36.380]  Do I really think I'm Darth Vader?
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:36.781]  No.
[01:44:36.801 --> 01:44:40.322]  Do I think I'm Optimus Prime, Bubble Commander, The Joker?
[01:44:40.362 --> 01:44:40.542]  No.
[01:44:40.842 --> 01:44:48.004]  And clearly, no reasonable person would think, when I'm doing satire, that what I'm saying is what I really think.
[01:44:48.704 --> 01:44:50.164]  No one believes the Babylon Bee.
[01:44:50.484 --> 01:44:53.145]  It's not trying to lie to you, it's being sarcastic.
[01:44:53.465 --> 01:44:55.246]  Buy the Vaccinate Me Elmo doll today.
[01:44:55.626 --> 01:44:57.246]  It's required by the CDC.
[01:44:57.366 --> 01:44:58.687]  But they play those games.
[01:44:59.747 --> 01:45:01.928]  And that's why I don't joke around as much as I used to.
[01:45:02.408 --> 01:45:10.573]  Even though I tell people, okay, this is a joke, this isn't serious, they clip it out and they say, no, this is what he really believes.
[01:45:11.213 --> 01:45:13.014]  Every day when I leave work, I do this.
[01:45:13.554 --> 01:45:14.755]  That man's a threat to this country.
[01:45:15.055 --> 01:45:17.116]  And they go, look, he admitted in court he's an actor.
[01:45:17.376 --> 01:45:19.857]  Well, yeah, I was an actor in Scanner Darkly.
[01:45:20.238 --> 01:45:21.458]  I was an actor in Waking Life.
[01:45:21.858 --> 01:45:24.640]  I was an actor when I was Cobra Commander.
[01:45:26.823 --> 01:45:35.291]  But it doesn't mean that Alex Jones, the talk show host, up here reading news articles to you isn't a real thing and isn't something I'm actually saying.
[01:45:35.311 --> 01:45:36.072]  And you know that!
[01:45:36.752 --> 01:45:37.833]  You're insulted right now.
[01:45:37.873 --> 01:45:39.135]  I'm even explaining that to you.
[01:45:39.455 --> 01:45:43.278]  And so am I. But that's who these people are.
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:47.582]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[01:45:48.804 --> 01:45:49.865]  Am I really Darth Vader?
[01:45:51.223 --> 01:45:52.765]  I think Alex Jones seems really talented.
[01:45:53.026 --> 01:45:53.847]  He's smart.
[01:45:54.168 --> 01:45:55.049]  He's funny as hell.
[01:45:55.209 --> 01:45:56.552]  He's truly funny.
[01:45:56.832 --> 01:45:58.832]  I'm kind of retarded.
[01:45:58.832 --> 01:46:05.832]  [Music]
[01:46:05.832 --> 01:46:14.021]   Now that I've done those imitations, those little jokes, do you now not listen to what I say about other things when
[01:46:14.021 --> 01:46:19.261]   I show you a powerful news article by Dr. Joseph Mercola on InfoWars.com that has all the
[01:46:19.261 --> 01:46:23.832]   cited information, the latest tragedy, sudden adult death syndrome?
[01:46:23.778 --> 01:46:25.259]  No, that's a real thing.
[01:46:26.019 --> 01:46:28.440]  That's something happening in the real world.
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:30.681]  And that's what we're breaking down here today.
[01:46:31.989 --> 01:46:35.392]  I am Alex Jones, and I am the guy on this show every day.
[01:46:35.793 --> 01:46:42.512]   I am an American and that's what I promote is freedom and justice and liberty and they can't stand it.
[01:46:42.512 --> 01:46:55.152]  Pesky earth creatures.

[01:47:43.692 --> 01:47:44.253]  I apologize.

[01:47:51.293 --> 01:47:52.234]  A bunch of special guests.
[01:47:52.314 --> 01:47:55.917]  It'll just be at InfoWars.com, not on the radio and TV stations.
[01:47:55.937 --> 01:47:56.917]  11 a.m.
[01:47:56.937 --> 01:47:58.858]  tomorrow, we're doing that show.
[01:47:58.919 --> 01:48:00.560]  So we'll get the caller's name and numbers.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:01.961]  We'll call you back tomorrow if you can do it.
[01:48:02.661 --> 01:48:06.123]  We took a lot of calls in the first and second hour today.
[01:48:07.856 --> 01:48:15.018]  Judge, let me ask you this question, because you've got a lot of great points to make, but what do you make of DeSantis versus Trump?
[01:48:15.138 --> 01:48:16.198]  What do you make of Biden?
[01:48:16.238 --> 01:48:19.860]  How long can he hold on when it's on record he doesn't even know who he is?
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:25.341]  Just big picture, what do you see with Russia and Ukraine?
[01:48:25.361 --> 01:48:28.402]  Just big picture in the world, where do you see all this going?
[01:48:28.422 --> 01:48:29.622]  Because I really want to hear what you have to say.
[01:48:33.362 --> 01:48:35.182]  Brief comment on this committee.
[01:48:35.402 --> 01:48:46.925]  Some of the people that are on this January 6th committee and supporting what they're doing and saying that Trump was wrong by trying to incite the American public when he said the election was stolen.
[01:48:47.405 --> 01:49:02.061]   Hell, some of them were up 22 years ago in the 2000 election cycle screaming from the rooftops that Bush had stolen the election from Gore.
[01:49:02.321 --> 01:49:09.726]  And I remember that old thing with dangling chads and the debacle down in Florida that went on and on.
[01:49:09.866 --> 01:49:11.387]  So what's the matter?
[01:49:11.427 --> 01:49:13.268]  They can talk, but nobody else can.
[01:49:13.388 --> 01:49:26.316]  But anyway, I don't have much confidence in Biden and Mrs. Emhoff, that administration handling what is likely to develop with the Russians.
[01:49:26.836 --> 01:49:47.861]   Down in Syria, The Russian Air Force did an intention getting bombing or attack on a certain rebel base where Americans had been training some of the folk going back up to the Ukraine.
[01:49:48.481 --> 01:49:53.963]  That could lead to a shooting incident or two or three or four or 10 or 20 down there.
[01:49:55.464 --> 01:50:00.368]  In that area, and I don't think Biden and Imhoff are competent to handle it.
[01:50:00.608 --> 01:50:03.890]  That's right, that's really smart what you're saying, because I haven't covered that, but I meant to a few days ago.
[01:50:04.291 --> 01:50:07.333]  This war is widening into Syria, Turkey, you name it.
[01:50:08.474 --> 01:50:32.332]   Yeah, and it's getting out of hand, and I have the sneaking suspicion that the reason we're over in the Ukraine in the first place is so Biden can get this 120-some count indictment against him dismissed for Well, that's not his question.
[01:50:32.392 --> 01:50:39.540]  Why would he brag five years ago on C-SPAN that he ordered the prosecutor fired and they wouldn't give him a million dollars before he left office?
[01:50:40.561 --> 01:50:42.604]  Why would you brag about crimes you committed?
[01:50:43.701 --> 01:50:44.281]  One million.
[01:50:44.582 --> 01:50:48.404]  It was $14 billion in American loan guarantees.
[01:50:48.804 --> 01:51:00.532]  He said, I guess I am guilty of bribery and extortion because I told them that I'd see to it that they're $14 billion in loan guarantees.
[01:51:00.552 --> 01:51:01.893]  No, I agree, Judge.
[01:51:01.913 --> 01:51:02.273]  You're right.
[01:51:02.313 --> 01:51:02.894]  It's on record.
[01:51:02.954 --> 01:51:04.034]  Why would he admit that?
[01:51:04.195 --> 01:51:05.215]  I'm asking you, why?
[01:51:05.235 --> 01:51:06.736]  He said he's a fool.
[01:51:07.097 --> 01:51:10.759]  He's never been the brightest bulb on sale in the store.
[01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:15.712]  Now, that being the case, it's a real live mess.
[01:51:15.872 --> 01:51:17.633]  See, Article 6 of the U.S.
[01:51:17.693 --> 01:51:22.756]  Constitution says ratified treaties are part of the supreme law of the land.
[01:51:22.856 --> 01:51:32.702]  And one of our ratified treaties is with Ukraine, and it says we will honor agreements with them to apprehend and assist in the investigation.
[01:51:32.742 --> 01:51:34.103]  So they're using that as a blank check?
[01:51:36.241 --> 01:51:39.182]  So, and then they set up another one, and I love this one.
[01:51:39.562 --> 01:51:47.466]  When they went after Mr. Trump and impeached him the second time, although he was no longer in office, they set the precedent.
[01:51:48.026 --> 01:51:57.630]  So, Article 2, Section 4 of the Constitution says impeachment for bribe, well, bribery, treason, and high crimes and misdemeanors in office.
[01:51:57.670 --> 01:51:58.630]  Those three things.
[01:51:58.730 --> 01:52:02.292]  Well, he's already admitted he's into bribery.
[01:52:03.064 --> 01:52:10.127]  We have indictments in Ukraine charging him with bribery, extortion, etc., etc.
[01:52:10.447 --> 01:52:14.229]  That's certainly a high crime and or misdemeanor office.
[01:52:14.449 --> 01:52:20.111]  And while we whoopee, even though he's no longer vice president, they already set the stage.
[01:52:20.191 --> 01:52:28.890]   So when the Democratic Party gets their behinds kicked in these midterms, What with their approval ratings being so damn low.
[01:52:29.891 --> 01:52:32.374]  They've opened it up to go after Biden.
[01:52:32.554 --> 01:52:40.183]  And the reason they went after Mr. Trump was because of the 12th Amendment that says if you've been impeached, you can't hold any office again.
[01:52:40.444 --> 01:52:41.185]  No, I agree with you.
[01:52:41.225 --> 01:52:44.549]  So I'm asking, why would the Democratic Party commit suicide like this?
[01:52:45.814 --> 01:52:47.074]  They don't know any better.
[01:52:47.134 --> 01:52:49.315]  They don't think the rules apply to them.
[01:52:49.395 --> 01:52:51.356]  They are myopic in their sight.
[01:52:51.436 --> 01:52:54.097]  They have this, oh, this is what I want.
[01:52:54.177 --> 01:53:03.540]  It's like a child wanting an ice cream cone and they throw a tantrum and they forget about everything outside of that ice cream cone or candy.
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:11.382]  Or you see them pitching a tantrum in the aisles at a department store when you get to the toy department.
[01:53:12.481 --> 01:53:23.246]  They stomp and they carry on and they bang their fist on the ground and they roll all over the place and they're screeching, I want it, I want it, and they don't care about what's going on.
[01:53:24.046 --> 01:53:27.248]  That's because they are essentially immature.
[01:53:28.028 --> 01:53:28.788]  I agree.
[01:53:28.808 --> 01:53:30.629]  That's why they've run their cities in the ground, everything.
[01:53:30.669 --> 01:53:31.089]  You're right.
[01:53:31.149 --> 01:53:32.050]  That's scary, though.
[01:53:32.650 --> 01:53:33.730]  The people in charge of the country.
[01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:36.972]  Did you see Biden today blame gas stations for gas prices?
[01:53:37.944 --> 01:53:38.444]  Oh yeah.
[01:53:38.885 --> 01:53:39.825]  And then look at this.
[01:53:39.865 --> 01:53:44.448]  You know what the travesty is for those gas prices is this.
[01:53:46.529 --> 01:54:01.999]  The crude oil that has been refined and is on sale right now was acquired 13, 14 months ago at those prices and a great deal of it has been pulled out of reserves thanks to banks.
[01:54:02.039 --> 01:54:02.499]  Exactly.
[01:54:02.559 --> 01:54:04.040]  So it's about to explode in price.
[01:54:05.131 --> 01:54:10.797]  The price is from 40, 50, 60, 70 years ago.
[01:54:11.257 --> 01:54:13.179]  Now here's another thing.
[01:54:13.199 --> 01:54:17.864]  99% of all domestically consumed oil is imported.
[01:54:20.603 --> 01:54:24.324]  We don't have any alternative energy sources being funded.
[01:54:24.384 --> 01:54:29.525]  They need to have a Manhattan Project on that like they did with the bomb during World War II.
[01:54:29.705 --> 01:54:32.766]  But Biden's administration is pushing this.
[01:54:32.866 --> 01:54:39.908]  So when you have imported oil, what happens is 25% has to go into the American oil reserves.
[01:54:40.108 --> 01:54:54.621]   And by law, the oil importers get paid $5 per barrel for whatever market price it or what goes into the reserve. So they're making money hand
[01:54:54.621 --> 01:55:02.529]   over foot. And look at the price of fuel for trucks. That is essentially a byproduct. It's
[01:55:02.529 --> 01:55:03.100]  waste.
[01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:05.740]  Now, Judy, we know you know all the angles. It's amazing.
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:10.780]   In closing, what do you expect to happen under all this malfeasance?
[01:55:10.780 --> 01:55:16.059]   Well, we're gonna have a big hole we're gonna have to climb out of,
[01:55:16.059 --> 01:55:20.699]   and I hope it isn't a bottomless rabbit hole and we wind up like Great Britain,
[01:55:20.699 --> 01:55:26.860]   a second rate power with the People's Republic of China lording it over everybody.
[01:55:27.101 --> 01:55:28.261]  So that's the danger.
[01:55:29.301 --> 01:55:31.162]  They have cut too much off.
[01:55:31.222 --> 01:55:33.263]  They are destroying manhood.
[01:55:33.303 --> 01:55:35.503]  They're destroying education.
[01:55:35.523 --> 01:55:37.624]  They're pricing everything out of reach.
[01:55:38.388 --> 01:55:53.875]  They have engendered deliberate inflation, and I say that on purpose because that helps out the financial market, the investment market, because it reduces existing loan loads and debt obligations.
[01:55:54.662 --> 01:56:07.830]  And we've got a bunch of creeps in there that are more interested in who gets to play girl than they are in the effectiveness to deal with the other 97% of the American population.
[01:56:07.891 --> 01:56:10.952]  So we've reached a Marie Antoinette moment of let them eat cake.
[01:56:12.453 --> 01:56:15.195]  What do you see happening with the midterms and the election?
[01:56:16.396 --> 01:56:19.698]  I think that the Democratic Party is going to get slaughtered.
[01:56:20.393 --> 01:56:37.140]  Every time for the last half century, when one party's percentages of support dropped below a certain point, that party always loses control of whatever chamber of Congress it controls.
[01:56:37.440 --> 01:56:39.841]  And Biden's are the worst ever.
[01:56:40.862 --> 01:56:51.845]   And interestingly enough, his would-be replacement, Kamala Emhoff, well, Harris-Hemhoff, Hers are the absolute worst ever.
[01:56:52.525 --> 01:57:01.448]  Piru Agnew, who wound up doing time in state and federal penitentiaries when he was vice president to Tricky Dick Nixon.
[01:57:01.628 --> 01:57:09.170]  Even after he resigned because of criminal charges pending, his ratings were better than Kamala Harris' them all.
[01:57:10.150 --> 01:57:12.731]  So this is a complete disaster.
[01:57:13.291 --> 01:57:23.981]   We've got two incompetents sitting up there In line, one's already in office, and he can't even remember where the hell he is, let alone what's going on.
[01:57:24.802 --> 01:57:27.523]  And Kamala Harris has always been lazy.
[01:57:27.543 --> 01:57:28.704]  She wants to show some reason.
[01:57:28.724 --> 01:57:29.264]  No, you're right.
[01:57:29.324 --> 01:57:30.665]  Judge Joe Brown, amazing.
[01:57:30.785 --> 01:57:34.446]  At Judge Joe Brown TV on Twitter, thejudgejoebrownshow.com.
[01:57:34.466 --> 01:57:36.968]  We got your great barbecue sauce at fullrestore.com.
[01:57:36.988 --> 01:57:38.128]  Thanks for spending an hour with us.
[01:57:38.148 --> 01:57:39.229]  It's been amazing, sir.
[01:57:39.269 --> 01:57:39.609]  Thank you.
[01:57:41.548 --> 01:57:42.929]  All right, have a great time.
[01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:43.530]  Here you go.
[01:57:43.730 --> 01:57:44.550]  We love you, Joe.
[01:57:45.231 --> 01:57:47.653]  All right, we'll be right back with the next guest host taking over.
[01:57:47.713 --> 01:57:54.939]  Paul Joseph Watson, stay with us.
[01:57:54.999 --> 01:57:57.581]  Josh, in FEMA Region 3, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:57:58.857 --> 01:58:00.438]  Alex, it's an honor to talk to you.
[01:58:00.898 --> 01:58:01.339]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:01.479 --> 01:58:03.260]  Real quick, I just want to plug X2.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:05.601]  Man, I've been taking it for the last month and a half.
[01:58:05.861 --> 01:58:07.362]  It's made amazing changes.
[01:58:07.462 --> 01:58:08.543]  I started dreaming again.
[01:58:08.563 --> 01:58:10.544]  It's just, it's amazing.
[01:58:10.824 --> 01:58:12.045]  I just feel better.
[01:58:12.165 --> 01:58:13.526]  Like, it's hard to explain.
[01:58:13.566 --> 01:58:15.627]  I feel like I'm more hydrated.
[01:58:15.687 --> 01:58:16.367]  I'm a roofer.
[01:58:16.507 --> 01:58:19.929]  It normally takes a lot of water to stay hydrated for me.
[01:58:20.009 --> 01:58:21.790]  It feels like I'm retaining water better.
[01:58:21.850 --> 01:58:23.611]  Like I said, I started dreaming again.
[01:58:23.651 --> 01:58:32.381]   I haven't had a dream in two Well, this isn't some New Age thing.
[01:58:32.421 --> 01:58:33.522]  They just piggyback on it.
[01:58:33.962 --> 01:58:38.187]  The pineal gland gets filled with fluoride, and that's the third eye.
[01:58:38.266 --> 01:58:42.386]   Literally, it's connected to higher dreaming, higher consciousness medically, and then obviously
[01:58:42.386 --> 01:58:44.386]  the ancients said spiritual connection.
[01:58:44.386 --> 01:58:47.865]   And when it gets filled with fluoride and bromide and bromine, all the bad allergens,
[01:58:47.865 --> 01:58:51.726]   then people don't dream and they don't have higher consciousness statistically.
[01:58:51.726 --> 01:58:54.867]  But real iodine goes through and just burns all that out.
[01:58:54.867 --> 01:58:58.945]   It doesn't just get in there, it removes the bad stuff in the major studies.
[01:58:58.945 --> 01:59:00.546]  That's why everybody should get X2.

[01:59:24.302 --> 01:59:25.122]  I love Alex Jones.
[01:59:25.623 --> 01:59:25.923]  A lot.
[01:59:25.963 --> 01:59:27.004]  He's been right about everything.
[01:59:27.844 --> 01:59:29.346]  Alex Jones is always right!
[01:59:29.906 --> 01:59:31.247]  Who's your daddy?
[01:59:31.687 --> 01:59:32.548]  Alex Jones is daddy.
[01:59:37.292 --> 01:59:39.292]  Who's your daddy?
[01:59:39.292 --> 01:59:45.292]  Who's your daddy?
[01:59:45.292 --> 01:59:47.292]  Alex Jones!
[01:59:47.292 --> 01:59:49.292]  [XBOX SOUND]
[01:59:49.292 --> 01:59:55.292]  [Music]
[01:59:53.962 --> 01:59:58.442]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:59:58.442 --> 02:00:10.242]  [Music]
[02:00:10.185 --> 02:00:14.888]  You read that, you actually know everything that's going to happen exactly as it's going to happen.
[02:00:14.928 --> 02:00:16.750]  I'm just giving credit where it's due.
[02:00:16.610 --> 02:00:21.610]  Well, you didn't read the Old Testament, so you didn't know.
[02:00:21.610 --> 02:00:25.410]   You read that, you actually know everything that's going to happen, exactly as it's going
[02:00:25.410 --> 02:00:26.410]  to happen.
[02:00:26.410 --> 02:00:28.449]  I'm just giving credit where it's due.
[02:00:28.449 --> 02:00:30.770]  And you know, that's that paradox.
[02:00:30.770 --> 02:00:32.369]  They're good Germans, they're bad Germans.
[02:00:32.367 --> 02:00:33.969]  There are good Christians, there are bad Christians.
[02:00:33.989 --> 02:00:35.310]  There are good Jews, there are bad Jews.
[02:00:36.031 --> 02:00:45.198]  But I gotta say, Dr. Zelenko, it is amazing that Ezekiel and Moses and everything is just so powerful.
[02:00:45.218 --> 02:00:51.824]  A few minutes, because I know you're a humble person, but how did the Jews particularly foresee all of this?
[02:00:53.233 --> 02:00:57.552]   out of all the cultures because the more I study it, the more those ancient Jews,
[02:00:57.552 --> 02:01:02.832]   5,000, 6,000, 3,000 years ago are dead on. You know, Plato I've given credit to.
[02:01:02.832 --> 02:01:06.592]   Now, he made a lot of predictions, made a lot of things 2,000, 300 years ago. But
[02:01:06.592 --> 02:01:09.393]   so the Greeks, you got to give some credit to too. But what's going on?
[02:01:09.393 --> 02:01:13.712]   What's going on with Jews knowing all this and then somebody like Harari
[02:01:13.712 --> 02:01:20.353]   turns his back completely on it? Jews are absolutely nothing without the law and without
[02:01:21.793 --> 02:01:29.793]   obeying the Creator and serving as a light unto the nations by bringing the knowledge
[02:01:29.793 --> 02:01:32.432]  of the Creator into the creation.
[02:01:32.618 --> 02:01:41.042]  And no one is denying that it was the Jewish faith that brought the morality and God's law into the world.
[02:01:41.742 --> 02:01:48.725]  And so, it really starts with the characteristics and attributes of the first Jew, Abraham.
[02:01:49.548 --> 02:01:51.789]  Now, let me just paint a picture of how he grew up.
[02:01:52.249 --> 02:01:54.690]  He grew up in a world where no one believes in the One God.
[02:01:55.751 --> 02:01:57.852]  Everyone was an idol worshipper, including his own father.
[02:01:59.032 --> 02:02:03.374]  And he sensed, just logically, rationally, that there's something not right here.
[02:02:03.434 --> 02:02:04.294]  It doesn't make sense.
[02:02:04.895 --> 02:02:13.478]  And he used his mind and came to the conclusion that, no, there must be a primal cause, a One God that set everything into motion.
[02:02:14.219 --> 02:02:15.579]  And he went public about that.
[02:02:18.081 --> 02:02:19.342]  He was not liked.
[02:02:19.983 --> 02:02:21.825]  Actually, the entire world tried to kill him.
[02:02:22.445 --> 02:02:24.007]  And he said, I don't care.
[02:02:24.027 --> 02:02:31.174]  I'm going to stand up for my principles, my beliefs, and I'm going to sanctify the name of God, even if it costs me my life.
[02:02:31.795 --> 02:02:33.436]  And he was the only one on the planet doing it.
[02:02:34.457 --> 02:02:39.963]  But that was the essence of the stubbornness, this arrogance, but for God.
[02:02:39.983 --> 02:02:44.262]   You know, every attribute could be used for good and for bad.
[02:02:44.262 --> 02:02:50.143]   And if you have an arrogant streak in you, but a stubborn streak, but if you use it to
[02:02:50.143 --> 02:02:52.902]  serve God, then it's not necessarily bad.
[02:02:52.857 --> 02:02:59.760]  And so Abraham was a stubborn guy, and he stood up to the entire world and said, No, I'm not going to worship your idols.
[02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:02.221]  You are wrong.
[02:03:02.901 --> 02:03:04.201]  And there is a creator.
[02:03:04.862 --> 02:03:08.983]  So to answer your question, it's not, it's nothing special about us.
[02:03:09.583 --> 02:03:12.337]   It's the fact that we were Exactly.
[02:03:12.157 --> 02:03:22.157]   put into a role and only when we observe that role is there a certain grace that's brought into the world.
[02:03:22.157 --> 02:03:26.157]   Exactly. Only when we're aligned with the will of God are any of us strong.
[02:03:26.157 --> 02:03:27.157]  Correct.
[02:03:27.157 --> 02:03:30.157]  I know you gotta go, but we got other guests coming up.
[02:03:30.416 --> 02:03:32.257]  We've got Rainer Fulmik coming on.
[02:03:32.297 --> 02:03:35.439]  You never plug this stuff, but it's a great product, and you're supporting us.
[02:03:35.479 --> 02:03:36.960]  So do a few more minutes, we'll come back for a break.
[02:03:37.340 --> 02:03:40.903]  I want to talk about Z-Stack and the other products, but start talking about it now.
[02:03:40.923 --> 02:03:42.964]  You've got a new website for it.
[02:03:43.004 --> 02:03:47.527]  It's ZDT, or zdetoxlife.com forward slash Alex.
[02:03:47.547 --> 02:03:48.348]  You're also supporting us.
[02:03:50.069 --> 02:03:53.531]  Doctor, spend a minute or so talking about these products you've got, because you've got a bunch of great products.
[02:03:54.992 --> 02:03:57.494]  Well, NAC is a stop and look product.
[02:03:58.135 --> 02:04:01.639]  And for some reason there's a lot of blood clots going around lately, killing people, right?
[02:04:02.099 --> 02:04:03.060]  Heart attacks and strokes.
[02:04:03.561 --> 02:04:09.106]  So if you're at risk for blood clots, MAC is an over-the-counter option, which is great.
[02:04:09.687 --> 02:04:16.914]  Then EGCG, it's a green tea extract, is one of the most powerful zinc ionophores that gets zinc into the cell.
[02:04:17.655 --> 02:04:21.819]  And then it has zinc, because zinc stops RNA viruses from replicating.
[02:04:22.299 --> 02:04:23.079]  All right, stay there.
[02:04:23.139 --> 02:04:31.603]  Come back and just do two, three minutes with me on the other side, ahead of Reimer Fulmick, because I want you to talk about this, because I want to run an ad on air, because I know I approached you about being a sponsor.
[02:04:31.623 --> 02:04:32.263]  I love your products.
[02:04:32.303 --> 02:04:33.103]  My family uses them.
[02:04:33.503 --> 02:04:35.684]  My products are great, too, but yours are just as good or even better.
[02:04:36.024 --> 02:04:37.005]  I just want people to know about them.
[02:04:37.025 --> 02:04:37.945]  So please, humor me.
[02:04:38.265 --> 02:04:39.405]  Let's come back in a minute.
[02:04:39.686 --> 02:04:43.287]  I want you to talk two, three minutes so I can put an ad out of you talking about these great products.
[02:04:43.487 --> 02:04:48.209]  People find it zdetoxlife.com forward slash Alex if people want to support the broadcast.
[02:04:48.029 --> 02:05:10.029]   Whatever you do, boost your immune system now with the things God gave us.
[02:05:10.094 --> 02:05:14.258]  Double Patriot points and 40 to 75% off.
[02:05:14.498 --> 02:05:20.364]  All items are at least 40% off and some of our best sellers are 75% off.
[02:05:20.584 --> 02:05:22.946]  This is the biggest sale yet of the year.
[02:05:23.247 --> 02:05:25.048]  Some of these products we're selling at below cost.
[02:05:25.389 --> 02:05:29.189]   You've got to move them out of the warehouse to be able to continue to stay on the air.
[02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:33.429]   So please take action to declare independence from the New World Order by keeping the tip
[02:05:33.429 --> 02:05:39.307]  of the spear on air and getting great products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:39.307 --> 02:05:40.788]  I want to thank you all.
[02:05:40.788 --> 02:05:44.189]   This July 4th for your continued fight for America, and I would encourage you to join
[02:05:44.189 --> 02:05:47.108]  the fight even harder now because we're so close to winning.
[02:05:46.884 --> 02:05:54.083]   info war store dot com and celebrate July 4th 1776 part two against the new
[02:05:54.083 --> 02:06:08.922]   world order because the answer to 1984 is 1776 so if it's going to be used it's better to focus on those
[02:06:08.922 --> 02:06:15.222]   groups who have risk of severe disease and death rather than as we see some
[02:06:15.222 --> 02:06:22.323]   countries are using to give boosters to kill children which is not right
[02:06:21.725 --> 02:06:37.616]  So, when your government scientists tell you that a variant that's 0.3% different from SARS could masquerade as a new virus and be a threat to your health, you should know, and I'm telling you, they are lying.
[02:06:38.897 --> 02:06:45.545]   If they're lying, and they are, Why is the pharmaceutical industry making top-up vaccines?
[02:06:46.345 --> 02:06:47.146]  They are making them.
[02:06:47.726 --> 02:06:55.712]  You should be terrified at this point, as I am, because there's absolutely no possible justification for their manufacture.
[02:06:56.372 --> 02:07:07.641]  But they're being made, and the world's medicines regulators have said, because they're quite similar to the original vaccines, the ones that are being given now, we won't be asking them to do any clinical safety studies.
[02:07:07.661 --> 02:07:14.569]   So let me just say again, The variants are not different enough to represent a threat to you, so you do not need to top up vaccines.
[02:07:14.810 --> 02:07:19.096]  Yet, they are being made, and the regulators have more or less waved them through.
[02:07:20.478 --> 02:07:21.519]  I'm very frightened of that.
[02:07:21.980 --> 02:07:24.904]  There's no possible benign interpretation of this.
[02:07:26.586 --> 02:07:29.890]  I believe that they're going to be used to damage your health and possibly kill you.
[02:07:30.490 --> 02:07:30.951]  Seriously.
[02:07:31.331 --> 02:07:37.839]  I can see no sensible interpretation other than a serious attempt at mass depopulation.
[02:07:38.199 --> 02:07:40.121]  This will provide the tools to do it.
[02:07:40.922 --> 02:07:58.132]  And plausible deniability, because they'll create another story about some sort of biological threat, and you'll line up and get your top-up vaccines, and a few months or a year or so later, you'll die of some, you know, peculiar, explicable syndrome, and they won't be able to associate it with the top-up vaccines.
[02:07:58.152 --> 02:08:12.463]   But that's my belief, that they're lying to you about variants, so they can make damaging Top-up vaccines that you don't need at all and I think they'll be used for malign purposes and if you don't wake up That's what's going to happen.
[02:08:12.503 --> 02:08:30.843]   I think during next year Well, that's really scary and it's true it's dr. Michael Eden former head of the technology division and the head scientist of respiratory viruses at Pfizer And Dr. Robert Malone's the inventor of mRNA technology.
[02:08:30.883 --> 02:08:35.265]  The first year and a half, he's like, maybe they're idiots, maybe they don't know, but this is going to hurt a lot of people.
[02:08:35.325 --> 02:08:37.947]  Now he's like, no, it's premeditated, it's evil, we got to stop them.
[02:08:37.987 --> 02:08:39.287]  Because you cannot deny that.
[02:08:39.367 --> 02:08:45.130]  I had Dr. Zelenko on time before last, about a month ago, and I'm not tooting our horn.
[02:08:45.170 --> 02:08:46.730]  I'm saying we know what we're talking about.
[02:08:47.031 --> 02:08:49.632]  Please listen to us, because I want to get out of this with our lives.
[02:08:49.672 --> 02:08:50.732]  I want you to get out of it as well.
[02:08:51.152 --> 02:08:51.833]  This is real.
[02:08:51.853 --> 02:08:55.294]  It's the biggest threat in the last human development.
[02:08:55.314 --> 02:08:56.575]  This is the biggest event ever.
[02:08:56.615 --> 02:09:00.637]   You cannot That this is like Hitler on steroids.
[02:09:01.778 --> 02:09:15.445]  And that if we don't identify it's on purpose, and we don't identify these are war criminals, and we don't identify they cooked it up on purpose, then they keep being able to debate us and argue little fine points and keep people distracted.
[02:09:16.005 --> 02:09:19.907]  So that is not the point that we're making here.
[02:09:20.147 --> 02:09:21.788]  This is not some accidental thing.
[02:09:21.828 --> 02:09:26.310]  These aren't just companies that mean well that screwed up and all this garbage.
[02:09:26.906 --> 02:09:34.664]  These are individuals that are using this to take over the planet, and it's in the Great Reset documents, and it's an incredible time to be alive.
[02:09:36.596 --> 02:09:38.177]  Zev Zelenko joins us here.
[02:09:38.637 --> 02:09:39.718]  He needs no introduction.
[02:09:39.778 --> 02:09:40.658]  So much has happened.
[02:09:41.058 --> 02:09:49.703]  He also issued an alert yesterday that if something happens to him, that he's not died of cancer, which he's fighting right now, but that it could be foul play.
[02:09:50.183 --> 02:09:51.123]  I want to say the same thing.
[02:09:51.183 --> 02:09:52.504]  I'm getting a lot of death threats right now.
[02:09:52.784 --> 02:09:54.145]  We're not being dramatic, folks.
[02:09:54.525 --> 02:09:56.846]  We're at the tip of the spear, exposing mass murderers.
[02:09:56.906 --> 02:09:57.887]  This is a war.
[02:09:57.907 --> 02:10:03.549]   And like Marshall McLuhan said 50 years ago, In the future, the war is going to be distributed to the general public.
[02:10:03.569 --> 02:10:05.670]  It's not going to be main armies against each other.
[02:10:06.030 --> 02:10:08.391]  So Dr. Zelenko, so much going on, so much happening.
[02:10:08.431 --> 02:10:11.392]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday broadcast.
[02:10:12.952 --> 02:10:15.573]  Hi Alex, thanks again for having me.
[02:10:15.593 --> 02:10:20.255]  I got a lot of questions and a lot to say and a lot to break down and I want you to be able to take us where you want to go first.
[02:10:20.895 --> 02:10:22.676]  So take us there and then I want to talk to you about Dr.
[02:10:24.022 --> 02:10:31.269]  Michael Yeedon, who I know you talk a lot about getting even more hardcore now and basically aligning with what you and I are saying.
[02:10:31.849 --> 02:10:37.454]  It isn't about us being right, but I think it's key to really have people face what we're up against if we have any chance of beating it.
[02:10:39.156 --> 02:10:39.916]  So we do have a chance.
[02:10:40.137 --> 02:10:40.617]  We're going to win.
[02:10:41.318 --> 02:10:43.179]  It's like someone who plays chess.
[02:10:43.660 --> 02:10:47.023]  The better chess player you are, the more moves ahead you could see.
[02:10:47.523 --> 02:10:49.445]  And I see already that it's checkmate.
[02:10:50.037 --> 02:10:57.721]  The only question that's still a variable is how much carnage and what will be the body count of the innocent until we get to that point.
[02:10:58.382 --> 02:11:09.187]  And the reason why I'm doing these interviews is that I hope that spreading the true narrative and giving people hope may mitigate or reduce the body count.
[02:11:09.848 --> 02:11:12.829]  And so regarding Dr. Michael Yadin, I know him personally.
[02:11:13.670 --> 02:11:14.750]  He's a mentor of mine.
[02:11:14.770 --> 02:11:17.712]  He's a brilliant scientist, former Vice President of Pfizer.
[02:11:18.650 --> 02:11:25.475]  And he told me personally that for every one child that dies from COVID, 100 die from the vaccine.
[02:11:26.156 --> 02:11:31.480]  The vaccine is 100 times more lethal to children than the virus.
[02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:41.507]  I think it's more than that, but he has the statistics and the data analysis to prove that, and he has actually presented that information to the world.
[02:11:42.548 --> 02:11:43.448]  He's a man of integrity.
[02:11:43.508 --> 02:11:47.165]   He has only What to lose from coming out of retirement.
[02:11:47.185 --> 02:11:51.168]  He's a very wealthy man and doesn't need all this aggravation.
[02:11:51.208 --> 02:12:01.874]  The only reason why he's doing it is I believe that he's being motivated by altruism and a genuine desire to protect people from carnage.
[02:12:03.375 --> 02:12:14.501]  Now, I think that it's extremely important to understand what is the motivation behind the criminals and monsters that have done this.
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:17.541]  No one should believe a word I'm saying.
[02:12:17.561 --> 02:12:20.103]  They should just listen and then do their own due diligence.
[02:12:20.884 --> 02:12:27.909]  I provided for you resources and references to what I'm about to say, much of which I'm sure you know.
[02:12:28.570 --> 02:12:40.460]  But 30 years ago, it became obvious to the people in power and the wealthiest, most powerful people on the planet that there was going to be a major catastrophe economically.
[02:12:41.438 --> 02:12:50.564]  In 30 years, there will be a collapse bankruptcy of the beginning of bankruptcy of Social Security and Medicare.
[02:12:51.004 --> 02:12:52.025]  And that's all known.
[02:12:52.645 --> 02:13:03.292]  And Biden's recent policies of increased entitlements have upped the date to the anticipated collapse that 2027-2026 used to be 2028.
[02:13:03.612 --> 02:13:04.853]  That's the beginning.
[02:13:04.873 --> 02:13:15.518]   And within 10 years, there'll be a complete bankruptcy that will have a tsunami effect on the global economy and threatened the
[02:13:15.518 --> 02:13:24.977]   stakeholders, their power and their wealth and control mechanisms over humanity, which they've had
[02:13:24.977 --> 02:13:27.038]  cultivated over millennia.
[02:13:27.038 --> 02:13:40.637]   We're talking about a force of evil that has always used human slavery as an asset.
[02:13:40.637 --> 02:13:45.438]   Slavery has always been the most lucrative industry in the history of humanity.
[02:13:45.654 --> 02:13:47.175]  And these people are amoral.
[02:13:47.495 --> 02:13:48.316]  They're not immoral.
[02:13:48.396 --> 02:13:49.597]  They are amoral.
[02:13:50.097 --> 02:13:53.199]  Which means they are moral when it's expedient for them.
[02:13:53.659 --> 02:13:55.761]  They're immoral when it's expedient for them.
[02:13:56.323 --> 02:14:05.512]  They support the Jews when it's expedient for them, they support the Christians when it's useful to them, and then they set the Jews against the Christians and vice versa when it's useful for them.
[02:14:05.572 --> 02:14:09.616]  They're capitalists when they need to be, they're communists when they need to be.
[02:14:09.716 --> 02:14:24.271]   This level of malevolence transcends all of these systems that they have set, and they play games and create Chaos and geopolitical destabilization in order to promote their own agenda.
[02:14:24.591 --> 02:14:31.333]  In this particular case, it became obvious to everyone that it was going to be a huge economic collapse, and they were threatened.
[02:14:31.933 --> 02:14:32.653]  What have they done?
[02:14:33.533 --> 02:14:43.316]  They've initiated a plan over the last 30 years that will result in when the system collapses, the dust settles.
[02:14:44.617 --> 02:14:52.893]   They will have The new financial infrastructure and control mechanisms to lead to the ultimate enslavement of humanity.
[02:14:53.053 --> 02:14:53.833]  And let me explain.
[02:14:53.853 --> 02:15:22.494]   In 2016, everyone knows Klaus Schwab said that within 10 years, meaning by 2026, right before the anticipated collapse, 7 billion people will be tagged with a digital tracking device, essentially a biometric There's a sensor that transmits biometric data with your location to a third party.
[02:15:23.054 --> 02:15:24.435]  And it's not science fiction.
[02:15:24.515 --> 02:15:27.017]  There's a patent, which we've spoken about several times.
[02:15:27.478 --> 02:15:30.380]  He said on French TV, he said, first you'll wear it, then it'll be in the skin.
[02:15:31.881 --> 02:15:32.101]  Right.
[02:15:32.242 --> 02:15:34.884]  That's Paul Schwab saying that, and I have that video.
[02:15:35.304 --> 02:15:39.327]  But in addition to that, there's a patent, the two patents that go hand in hand.
[02:15:39.668 --> 02:15:47.351]   The one patent that says that the current vaccines have Nanotechnology in them that allows them to measure your heart rate.
[02:15:48.253 --> 02:15:48.994]  Stay right there.
[02:15:49.034 --> 02:15:50.317]  We're gonna come right back to you.
[02:15:50.337 --> 02:15:51.680]  This is riveting information.

[02:15:53.900 --> 02:16:10.900]  They don't want this brain trust, this spirit trust on air.

[02:16:28.395 --> 02:16:32.098]  But I need your backing if you want me to go in there and stomp the living hell out of these people.

[02:17:29.979 --> 02:17:30.739]  Nobody likes it.

[02:17:42.345 --> 02:17:44.907]  I'm tempted to pull the labels off of it and just say multivitamin on it.
[02:17:45.287 --> 02:17:48.949]  We can't keep the multivitamin stock, and quite frankly, that's what I said when we got this in.
[02:17:48.969 --> 02:17:51.991]  I said, this is a better formula than our multivitamin, which is incredible!
[02:17:52.271 --> 02:17:53.752]  This one's a little bit better.

[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:44.461]  It's more like a locomotive firing up that engine to go full power.
[02:18:44.501 --> 02:18:46.903]  And I don't care what happens is up to God now.
[02:18:47.143 --> 02:18:50.664]  I'm throwing it all in against them and going head to head with these people.
[02:18:50.643 --> 02:18:52.643]  and you're backing me and I love you.
[02:18:52.643 --> 02:18:55.303]  (air whooshing)

[02:18:57.963 --> 02:19:00.623]  (air whooshing)
[02:19:00.623 --> 02:19:05.863]   There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[02:19:06.776 --> 02:19:09.698]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[02:19:10.586 --> 02:19:13.848]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[02:19:14.129 --> 02:19:15.329]  You might not agree with everything.
[02:19:15.790 --> 02:19:18.892]  You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[02:19:19.632 --> 02:19:21.994]  And there's nowhere else, really, that does it like we do here.
[02:19:22.074 --> 02:19:22.855]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[02:19:23.235 --> 02:19:28.398]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, Infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks.
[02:19:28.459 --> 02:19:30.080]  And we do have the best supplements.
[02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:38.555]   I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, We do the best with our supplements as well.
[02:19:38.575 --> 02:19:41.117]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula.
[02:19:41.277 --> 02:19:42.558]  Folks, this is a joke.
[02:19:42.858 --> 02:19:44.179]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[02:19:44.199 --> 02:19:45.380]  It's 75% off.
[02:19:45.681 --> 02:19:48.042]  By the way, it works for me, in case you haven't noticed.
[02:19:48.262 --> 02:19:51.665]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[02:19:52.145 --> 02:19:53.987]  Quite well, I might add.
[02:19:54.387 --> 02:19:55.187]  Quite well.
[02:19:55.328 --> 02:19:58.350]  My barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[02:19:58.410 --> 02:19:59.731]  I go and see him quite often now.
[02:20:02.590 --> 02:20:07.149]   leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:07.149 --> 02:20:09.149]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:09.149 --> 02:20:18.909]   Now, I didn't talk to Dr. Zelenka before he came on air today.
[02:20:18.909 --> 02:20:22.829]   And I didn't tell him I want to talk about the Great Reset and engineered financial collapse
[02:20:22.829 --> 02:20:24.829]  and how Swab is now pre-programming the world.
[02:20:24.796 --> 02:20:27.697]  There's gonna be a big cyber attack that they claim terrorists launched.
[02:20:27.717 --> 02:20:28.718]  We know who'll really launch it.
[02:20:29.118 --> 02:20:32.400]  And notice he just brought it up without us even asking because we're all synced up.
[02:20:32.460 --> 02:20:33.460]  That's God consciousness.
[02:20:33.941 --> 02:20:35.141]  That's what scares the Satanist.
[02:20:35.581 --> 02:20:40.444]  He wrote an article titled, Government is the Enemy?
[02:20:41.625 --> 02:20:42.525]  What is really going on?
[02:20:42.545 --> 02:20:44.106]  By Dr. Zelenko.
[02:20:44.126 --> 02:20:46.127]  So, doctor, please continue.
[02:20:46.147 --> 02:20:52.029]   You got caught up on the break getting into They know they fraudulently created all this fractional reserve banking.
[02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:53.710]  They've created all these derivatives.
[02:20:54.010 --> 02:20:57.011]  They've taken the world over by it, but it's a scam.
[02:20:57.031 --> 02:21:11.678]  So instead of them all going to jail, they've come up with a plan to collapse the world economy, pose as the saviors, and depopulate the useless leaders in the process, which is what so many corrupt feudal lords have done in the past, like the Aztecs and others, when they didn't want to feed their population.
[02:21:11.978 --> 02:21:12.578]  Please continue.
[02:21:14.259 --> 02:21:37.702]   Yeah, so the patent that I mentioned earlier, it gives the technology and the mechanism through which Klaus Schwab's prophecy, let's say, about 7 billion people having a digital identifier that connects them to a centralized network or grid or matrix is going to happen.
[02:21:37.922 --> 02:21:42.064]  And the second patent that goes together with that is what Microsoft has from 2020.
[02:21:43.855 --> 02:21:46.197]  It's W.O.
[02:21:46.217 --> 02:21:52.801]  2020-06-06-06, and that patent describes the linkage of biometric data transmission to cryptocurrency.
[02:21:53.281 --> 02:21:55.142]  And so let me explain to you what that actually means.
[02:21:55.923 --> 02:22:06.269]  It means that in the future, say 2026 at the time, there'll be no more EasyPass, there'll be no more Apple Pay, there'll be no more credit cards.
[02:22:07.230 --> 02:22:10.492]  It'll be biometric transactions.
[02:22:10.612 --> 02:22:21.291]   In other words, You are now injected with a technology that transmits your internal temperament, your internal data, with your location to a third party.
[02:22:21.351 --> 02:22:27.537]  Now, and that will allow you to, let's say, put your hand on a scanner and then walk out from the supermarket.
[02:22:27.937 --> 02:22:33.538]   The hipsters think it's cool, but the problem with that is, what if I don't want to be part of the Matrix.
[02:22:33.839 --> 02:22:38.642]  What if I don't want to be injected with a tracking technology?
[02:22:39.163 --> 02:22:41.505]  Well, then I would be excluded from the system of finance.
[02:22:41.985 --> 02:22:47.589]  I won't be able to buy bread, at least not probably on the black market, but I won't be able to buy bread for my family.
[02:22:48.110 --> 02:22:49.151]  So it's a control mechanism.
[02:22:49.211 --> 02:22:50.071]  It's the mark of the beast.
[02:22:50.452 --> 02:23:03.129]   In other words, If I don't participate in the system that they have created and control, I will be excluded from the ability to do transactions, financial transactions.
[02:23:03.689 --> 02:23:04.971]  So they don't have to put a bullet in my head.
[02:23:05.411 --> 02:23:10.236]  They just have to prevent my ability to buy food for my family.
[02:23:10.502 --> 02:23:15.702]   and that's like the social credit system in China where basically they could set a radius through
[02:23:15.702 --> 02:23:18.671]  which I can't go out of my house and put me on house arrest.
[02:23:18.671 --> 02:23:24.341]   They know my location, I step out out of my permitted radius, let's say, and they turn off my
[02:23:24.341 --> 02:23:32.712]   ability to do finance. So this is a control mechanism and the entire crisis here has nothing to
[02:23:32.712 --> 02:23:44.847]   do with medicine, has nothing to do There are fools on this planet right now who actually think that the governing bodies actually care about your well-being, and there's no hope for you.
[02:23:45.207 --> 02:23:49.410]  But the reality is that COVID-19 is a weapon of mass destruction.
[02:23:49.450 --> 02:23:50.490]  It was made in a laboratory.
[02:23:50.550 --> 02:23:51.231]  No one denies that.
[02:23:51.251 --> 02:23:52.711]  And I want to tell you something, Alex.
[02:23:52.731 --> 02:23:58.480]   I don't know if you realize, Ralph Baric, Dr. Baric was involved in every step of the
[02:23:58.480 --> 02:24:03.759]   development of this bioweapon and converting it to a human virus.
[02:24:03.759 --> 02:24:09.240]   He took a bad coronavirus, changed some things on it, got a patent for it and technology
[02:24:09.240 --> 02:24:10.759]  to convert it to a human virus.
[02:24:10.759 --> 02:24:16.759]   Then Dr. Baric and Zheng Li in Wuhan, funded by the NIH, they published a paper thanking
[02:24:16.759 --> 02:24:21.400]   the NIH, figured out how to augment the lethality of this virus to destroy human lung tissue.
[02:24:21.484 --> 02:24:26.345]  Which was key because Fauci wanted his HIV protein to be part of it so he could pay.
[02:24:27.645 --> 02:24:29.286]  Yes, but here's something you may not know.
[02:24:29.786 --> 02:24:41.968]  That in March of 2020, I came across data, papers, that helped me formulate my treatment approach based on zinc and zinc anaphores, which is what the Z-Stack concept is.
[02:24:42.671 --> 02:24:46.494]  What I didn't realize until last week was that Ralph Barrett published that paper.
[02:24:48.235 --> 02:24:48.816]  Processed that.
[02:24:49.856 --> 02:24:54.840]  In other words, the guy who made the bomb also created the antidote to defuse the bomb.
[02:24:55.822 --> 02:24:56.563]  Funded by the government.
[02:24:56.903 --> 02:24:57.944]  Incredible.
[02:24:58.464 --> 02:24:59.505]  Start over, say that again.
[02:24:59.525 --> 02:25:00.606]  That is, no, I did not know that.
[02:25:01.007 --> 02:25:01.807]  This is groundbreaking.
[02:25:02.268 --> 02:25:04.550]  Explain, oh my, you're a big researcher.
[02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:06.512]  That's how you found these treatments nobody else had.
[02:25:06.852 --> 02:25:13.858]  And then when you found the research paper, it's the guy that was engineering it all out of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, with Obama, with Fauci, moving it.
[02:25:14.179 --> 02:25:14.879]  This is so huge.
[02:25:15.059 --> 02:25:15.580]  Please start over.
[02:25:16.841 --> 02:25:19.103]  And by the way, on your Skype is a link to that paper.
[02:25:20.344 --> 02:25:26.836]   Everything I'm saying I have evidence for it and it should be presented because otherwise it won't be believed.
[02:25:26.856 --> 02:25:26.996]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:27.016 --> 02:25:29.677]  We'll either put it on screen or we'll put it in post later once this is archived.
[02:25:29.697 --> 02:25:30.397]  Please start over.
[02:25:30.417 --> 02:25:30.897]  This is huge.
[02:25:30.917 --> 02:25:32.557]  All right, fine.
[02:25:32.577 --> 02:25:38.878]  So Ralph Baric in 1999 did research at the University of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[02:25:39.279 --> 02:25:48.360]  He was able to manipulate a bad animal virus, a bad coronavirus, converted by modulating a surface protein to infect human beings.
[02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:49.601]  But it was still benign.
[02:25:50.221 --> 02:25:51.541]  It was just infecting human beings then.
[02:25:52.372 --> 02:26:10.467]  And then, in 2010, the same Ralph Baric figured out a way to diffuse coronaviruses by using zinc and zinc anion, of course, inhibiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or inhibiting a coronavirus replication.
[02:26:10.607 --> 02:26:16.836]   In 2015, and by the way, everything's here is being funded by the United States government, So, because it's on the papers.
[02:26:17.316 --> 02:26:23.459]  And on the peer-reviewed papers, they thank the United States government, NIH or whatever, for the funding.
[02:26:23.479 --> 02:26:40.597]   Then, in 2015, in Wuhan, Eric, together in collaboration with Zhengli, Dr. Zhengli, the bad lady they call her, were able to figure out a way to augment the payload of this weapon To destroy human lung tissue and cause blood clots.
[02:26:41.217 --> 02:26:43.038]  They wrote a paper about it.
[02:26:43.098 --> 02:26:44.479]  They thanked the NIH.
[02:26:44.879 --> 02:26:47.080]  They published it and they got patents on it.
[02:26:47.901 --> 02:26:49.502]  And here's another layer to the story.
[02:26:49.562 --> 02:26:54.724]  The same Ralph Baric worked with the team from Gilead Pharmaceuticals to make remdesivir.
[02:26:58.046 --> 02:27:00.027]  Which destroys the kidneys and doesn't help you.
[02:27:00.047 --> 02:27:01.208]  This is so diabolical.
[02:27:01.468 --> 02:27:04.029]  So every way you can see the criminal pre-planning.
[02:27:05.570 --> 02:27:05.810]  Yes.
[02:27:06.431 --> 02:27:12.314]   And so This is a bio web and they had the antidote for it.
[02:27:12.314 --> 02:27:17.314]   And they suppressed the antidote intentionally, not for themselves.
[02:27:17.314 --> 02:27:22.314]   Do you think these masterminds want their own families to die?
[02:27:22.071 --> 02:27:22.831]  Of course not.
[02:27:23.251 --> 02:27:24.071]  They themselves know.
[02:27:24.091 --> 02:27:41.294]  This is consistent with what I knew about the executives of... Yeah, you broke that a year ago, and Joe Rogan confirmed it, that hundreds of members of Congress in Hollywood all know about this, but still want it suppressed, that your protocol, they were using your protocol, but they suppress it for the general public.
[02:27:41.574 --> 02:27:42.354]  Talk about evil.
[02:27:43.975 --> 02:27:49.649]   Yeah, also the executives of Google, I know, Internally that they're all taking hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.
[02:27:50.509 --> 02:28:03.678]  And so this was this information, the antidote to the bomb, the poison, was known, was created by the same, the same monsters, but they hid it from you and me.
[02:28:03.918 --> 02:28:11.560]   Now when doctors like myself stumbled across these approaches, Because we had a necessity.
[02:28:11.580 --> 02:28:12.380]  The patients were dying.
[02:28:12.761 --> 02:28:13.822]  And so we needed some help.
[02:28:14.462 --> 02:28:15.143]  We needed help.
[02:28:15.624 --> 02:28:16.605]  We needed to treat the patients.
[02:28:17.105 --> 02:28:36.078]   And so, immediately, anything that would help, hydroxychloroquine, then ivermectin, and even the concept of early intervention, getting rid of this infection before the complications begin, everything was vilified, marginalized, and Uh, doctors that were advocating for it were deplatformed.
[02:28:36.098 --> 02:28:37.299]  So then you have to ask your buddy about it.
[02:28:37.319 --> 02:28:40.702]  What you've laid out is they knew it, they had it planned, they censored it, they did it all.
[02:28:40.723 --> 02:28:43.245]  We'll come back with Dr. Zelenko to explain how huge this is.
[02:28:43.064 --> 02:29:03.903]  This is straight ahead, please stay with us.
[02:29:04.448 --> 02:29:06.009]  We've got a couple of important issues.
[02:29:06.049 --> 02:29:07.349]  We have a wide open border.
[02:29:07.369 --> 02:29:08.650]  We have fentanyl pouring in.
[02:29:08.690 --> 02:29:11.031]  We have the cartels with operational control.
[02:29:11.412 --> 02:29:14.693]  But that wouldn't be happening if we would have fair, honest elections.
[02:29:19.153 --> 02:29:24.799]  We had a fraudulent election, a corrupt election, and we have an illegitimate president sitting in the White House.
[02:29:24.859 --> 02:29:27.661]  And because of that, our border is wide open.
[02:29:27.761 --> 02:29:33.167]  Five and a half tons of fentanyl was confiscated last year, enough to kill over two billion people.
[02:29:33.187 --> 02:29:35.089]  It's a weapon of mass destruction.
[02:29:35.569 --> 02:29:39.393]  And that's why we're going to secure that border starting on day one.
[02:29:39.433 --> 02:29:43.617]  After I take my hand off the Bible, we are going to issue a declaration of invasion.
[02:29:44.057 --> 02:29:51.347]  We're going to finish President Trump's wall and we're going to send our armed National Guard to the border and stop people from coming across.
[02:29:56.300 --> 02:30:05.765]  Just to circle back, you say that it's an illegitimate president, you say that the election was stolen, you speak a lot about this on the campaign trail, talking about the 2020 election.
[02:30:06.265 --> 02:30:11.148]  This is the Arizona House Speaker, Rusty Bowers, testifying in front of Congress last week.
[02:30:11.568 --> 02:30:17.591]  Anywhere, anyone, anytime has said that I said the election was rigged, that would not be true.
[02:30:17.691 --> 02:30:22.834]  There was no evidence being presented of any strength.
[02:30:23.991 --> 02:30:27.372]  He's a Republican, he's a Trump supporter, and that's what he said.
[02:30:28.452 --> 02:30:29.233]  He's a rhino.
[02:30:33.534 --> 02:30:35.034]  Here's what we have.
[02:30:35.314 --> 02:30:38.215]  740,000 ballots that have no chain of custody.
[02:30:38.255 --> 02:30:41.116]  They cannot be authenticated and they should not have been counted.
[02:30:41.136 --> 02:30:45.097]  34,000 ballots that were counted two, three, and four times.
[02:30:45.577 --> 02:30:47.998]  People who moved who still voted in our election.
[02:30:49.491 --> 02:30:57.739]  There's a mountain of evidence and I wish that the corporate media would start covering it instead of putting their head in the sand and acting like it didn't happen.
[02:30:57.940 --> 02:31:11.634]  I understand what you're saying, but there have been, as you know, more than 70 court cases where there was not evidence and there was not any state legislature or governor that failed to certify an election, including your own Republican Doug Ducey.
[02:31:12.154 --> 02:31:15.236]  We did not have any court cases where the evidence was presented.
[02:31:15.296 --> 02:31:21.659]  We now have evidence that is admissible in a court of law, and I believe the day will come where we have that court case.
[02:31:22.120 --> 02:31:28.683]  We have an AG, Mark Bernadette, who has sat on a mountain of evidence and done nothing, including video evidence.
[02:31:31.745 --> 02:31:33.486]  We have the true-the-vote evidence.
[02:31:33.946 --> 02:31:37.689]  We have people who do not want to uncover the truth about our election.
[02:31:38.349 --> 02:31:40.190]  When I'm governor, we're going to get to the bottom of it.
[02:31:41.511 --> 02:31:43.375]  We thank you and we'll cover the primary.
[02:31:43.396 --> 02:31:43.997]  Thank you.
[02:31:44.017 --> 02:31:46.803]  Please send reporters out to cover this corrupt election.
[02:31:46.843 --> 02:31:47.665]  We would appreciate it.
[02:31:48.065 --> 02:31:49.065]  Thank you.
[02:31:49.065 --> 02:32:05.305]   I don't care if you work at a cafeteria or pump gas or whether you're a farmer, a rancher,
[02:32:05.305 --> 02:32:06.944]  a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[02:32:07.198 --> 02:32:10.439]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[02:32:10.479 --> 02:32:11.199]  You see it every year.
[02:32:11.219 --> 02:32:13.540]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[02:32:13.560 --> 02:32:16.021]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[02:32:16.661 --> 02:32:26.746]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[02:32:26.766 --> 02:32:38.031]  So, it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody, to be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful, that allows you to keep more of your money.
[02:32:38.051 --> 02:32:42.273]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[02:32:43.516 --> 02:32:48.498]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com.
[02:32:48.738 --> 02:32:50.498]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com or call 833-900-4285.
[02:32:50.518 --> 02:32:50.798]  833-900-4285.
[02:32:50.617 --> 02:32:53.817]  Or call 833-900-4285.
[02:32:53.817 --> 02:32:57.117]  833-900-4285.
[02:32:57.117 --> 02:33:07.316]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:33:07.316 --> 02:33:09.117]  it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:10.117 --> 02:33:21.117]   ♪ Moon of no-no, not for a day ♪ ♪ So be it ♪
[02:33:21.117 --> 02:33:27.117]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Dr. Zelenko.
[02:33:27.117 --> 02:33:30.117]  [Music]
[02:33:28.242 --> 02:33:42.869]  And again, I would apologize for 14 minutes of ads an hour, but that's the standard for talk radio and TV, and I hate going to break when Dr. Zelenko is saying something so important, but it's all hardwired in by the satellite feeds that literally cut into the radio stations.
[02:33:43.409 --> 02:33:48.945]   That's why the de-platforming off the main internet We said on air we had over 200 radio stations, and we still do.
[02:33:49.345 --> 02:33:50.766]  We're very thankful to those stations.
[02:33:51.107 --> 02:33:53.509]  But I am going to start the new year three nights a week.
[02:33:54.631 --> 02:34:08.995]  At least three nights a week, a multi-hour, commercial-free podcast, direct to you, the viewers and listeners, with guests and callers, where I might take a break to go to the bathroom or get a cup of coffee or something, but it's not going to have regular commercial breaks, so look for that in the new year, something I promised to do.
[02:34:09.015 --> 02:34:10.636]  The world's so crazy, we're here.
[02:34:10.656 --> 02:34:15.077]  But Dr. Zelenko, I know our listeners are smart, they're awesome people, but I want them to get what you're saying.
[02:34:15.477 --> 02:34:22.748]   You're laying out any grand jury It would take a few weeks to give a grand jury all this, but they would definitely indict Fauci for what you're saying.
[02:34:23.288 --> 02:34:28.049]  You're laying out the compendium of basically how this criminal plan was set up.
[02:34:28.509 --> 02:34:37.650]  And when you see how criminal it was, like you were saying last time you were on, months before the outbreak, Gates and Fauci are already sending messages saying, get the vaccine ready.
[02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:39.391]  They're like, wait, they didn't make the vaccine.
[02:34:39.411 --> 02:34:46.332]  No, they own the patents to what vaccine they, quote, wanted to then be sent out to the major makers, which they also got paid money from.
[02:34:46.372 --> 02:34:55.675]   So the trail I think it's what you're saying of them scientifically preparing this is one of the most open and shut premeditated murder cases ever.
[02:34:55.715 --> 02:34:56.396]  Is that what you're saying?
[02:34:58.237 --> 02:35:00.019]  I'm saying this is the worst crime in human history.
[02:35:00.699 --> 02:35:02.040]  It's a genocide.
[02:35:02.641 --> 02:35:06.424]  It's mass murder, first degree premeditated genocide and mass murder.
[02:35:07.405 --> 02:35:16.953]  And it's being driven essentially by demonic personalities that are absolutely obsessed with power.
[02:35:17.785 --> 02:35:22.146]  And wealth, but more than wealth, I think it's power.
[02:35:22.206 --> 02:35:26.127]  Because once you have $100 billion, let's say, what's the difference if you have $150 billion?
[02:35:26.147 --> 02:35:26.707]  You don't feel it.
[02:35:27.087 --> 02:35:44.551]  But power and being able to enslave others, it fulfills the perverse desires of these narcissists, egotists, and really, I would call them Satan incarnate or the embodiment of the essence of evil.
[02:35:47.679 --> 02:35:49.820]  You know who Barbara Marks Hubbard was?
[02:35:49.980 --> 02:35:50.361]  Yes.
[02:35:51.761 --> 02:35:54.543]  Okay, she is the demonic mother of the New World Order.
[02:35:54.563 --> 02:35:58.465]  I hope she burns in hell for all eternity.
[02:35:58.665 --> 02:36:02.768]  And I'm going to read you a few quotes from her that will explain to you the philosophy.
[02:36:03.128 --> 02:36:08.551]  She's the mother of the ideology of Klaus Schwab, let's say.
[02:36:09.872 --> 02:36:13.714]  One-fourth of humanity must be eliminated from the social body.
[02:36:13.734 --> 02:36:14.755]  It's a quote.
[02:36:15.379 --> 02:36:19.720]  We are in charge of God's selection process for planet Earth.
[02:36:20.361 --> 02:36:22.861]  He selects, we destroy.
[02:36:23.562 --> 02:36:27.283]  We are the riders of the pale horse death.
[02:36:28.403 --> 02:36:28.803]  End quote.
[02:36:29.144 --> 02:36:31.304]  Another quote from her.
[02:36:31.944 --> 02:36:35.486]  This act is as horrible as killing a cancer cell.
[02:36:36.126 --> 02:36:39.407]  It must be done for the sake of the future of the whole.
[02:36:40.314 --> 02:36:40.934]  So be it.
[02:36:41.535 --> 02:36:45.677]  Be prepared for the selection process, which is now beginning.
[02:36:45.897 --> 02:37:03.227]  We, the elders, have been patiently waiting until the very last moment before the quantum transformation to take action to cut out this corrupted and corrupting element in the body of humanity.
[02:37:03.848 --> 02:37:05.769]  It is like watching a cancer grow.
[02:37:06.349 --> 02:37:09.391]  Something must be done before the whole body is destroyed.
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:14.103]  The destructive one-fourth must be eliminated from the social body.
[02:37:15.924 --> 02:37:21.868]  I want to read you one more quote, not from her, from, his name's Jacques Attali.
[02:37:22.548 --> 02:37:31.054]  He was an advisor to the French Prime Minister from 1981 till in the 90s, I think 1991.
[02:37:31.274 --> 02:37:34.696]  Yeah, that was François Mitterrand, who was a big Luciferian.
[02:37:34.736 --> 02:37:35.316]  Please continue.
[02:37:36.697 --> 02:37:39.519]  Yes, so he was Mitterrand's right-hand man.
[02:37:40.735 --> 02:37:44.138]  And this is from a book called Verbatim in 1981.
[02:37:44.178 --> 02:37:54.184]  Now, the Facebook fact checker, Mythbusters or Myth, whatever it's called, says that this isn't true.
[02:37:54.505 --> 02:37:57.347]  But this is how I know that this must be true.
[02:37:58.127 --> 02:38:02.210]  The future will be about finding a way to reduce the population.
[02:38:02.830 --> 02:38:06.233]  Of course, we will not be able to execute people or build camps.
[02:38:06.952 --> 02:38:10.395]  We get rid of them by making them believe it is for their own good.
[02:38:11.096 --> 02:38:23.568]  We'll find or cause something, a pandemic targeting certain people, a real economic crisis or not, a virus affecting the old or the elderly.
[02:38:24.008 --> 02:38:24.569]  It doesn't matter.
[02:38:25.229 --> 02:38:28.212]  The weak and the fearful will succumb to it.
[02:38:28.933 --> 02:38:32.036]  The stupid will believe in it and ask to be treated.
[02:38:32.896 --> 02:38:40.718]  We will have taken care of having panned the treatment, a treatment that will be the solution.
[02:38:41.938 --> 02:38:46.459]  The selection of idiots will therefore be done by itself.
[02:38:47.499 --> 02:38:49.680]  They will go to the slaughterhouse alone.
[02:38:52.020 --> 02:38:52.400]  Wow.
[02:38:53.180 --> 02:38:59.802]  Dr. Zaliga, let me just say this, because this is about God consciousness, and I don't say something that isn't true, but it's a little embarrassing to say just because it's so personal.
[02:39:01.346 --> 02:39:03.427]  You normally, it takes about a week to get you on the show.
[02:39:03.447 --> 02:39:04.808]  Today you were able to come on.
[02:39:05.489 --> 02:39:08.410]  I had a dream about you last night, but I couldn't remember the dream when I woke up.
[02:39:09.071 --> 02:39:11.332]  When I got up, I said, I got to get Zelenko on today.
[02:39:12.113 --> 02:39:13.273]  And then I said, what was the dream about?
[02:39:13.293 --> 02:39:14.014]  I couldn't remember.
[02:39:14.834 --> 02:39:19.857]  And then I just remembered that I said to myself, well, Zelenko kind of says the same thing every time he's on, just like you do.
[02:39:19.877 --> 02:39:20.698]  It's not an attack.
[02:39:20.738 --> 02:39:21.158]  It's true.
[02:39:21.498 --> 02:39:22.419]  Same emergency message.
[02:39:22.479 --> 02:39:23.880]  But I said, no, today's going to be different.
[02:39:24.380 --> 02:39:25.821]  And then I intended to come in here.
[02:39:26.681 --> 02:39:35.604]  And talk about depopulation, talk about the UN, talk about Schwab, and talk about... She wasn't even by name, but those same groups, and then here you said it.
[02:39:36.284 --> 02:39:37.045]  This is amazing.
[02:39:37.645 --> 02:39:41.506]  And I'm not trying to be weird about it, it's just true, so I feel like I should have said that.
[02:39:41.586 --> 02:39:41.906]  Go ahead.
[02:39:44.327 --> 02:39:45.487]  Listen, truth is truth.
[02:39:45.587 --> 02:39:47.928]  It's in the air, you know?
[02:39:48.188 --> 02:39:56.131]   And people that are attuned to it, I think it's become much more accessible to anyone who wants to access and download this information.
[02:39:56.431 --> 02:39:57.571]  And I'm talking about metaphysically.
[02:39:58.052 --> 02:40:00.392]  That there's an intuitive sense of what's true and what's not.
[02:40:00.492 --> 02:40:24.221]   Anyone who has some degree of sensitivity sees that this is an attempt by the forces of evil to seal God consciousness and then use fear to breed Um, codependency on a cult, codependency on sociopaths and corrupt governments, and a belief in the golden calf of these, like, false promises.
[02:40:24.321 --> 02:40:27.221]  And so God knows evil's coming after us and God's opened the floodgates.
[02:40:27.241 --> 02:40:28.322]  That's what I feel, actually.
[02:40:28.722 --> 02:40:31.162]  I mean, my discernment's way more powerful than it used to be.
[02:40:31.623 --> 02:40:32.583]  Are you seeing the same thing?
[02:40:34.383 --> 02:40:35.984]  Yeah, but I see it actually in a different way.
[02:40:36.644 --> 02:40:40.985]  I see that God is giving every human being an opportunity.
[02:40:41.025 --> 02:40:49.550]   It's like we're in the generation right before the flood of Noah, and God is saying, listen, repent and get on the ark.
[02:40:50.070 --> 02:40:55.253]  Don't stay in the turbulent waters of idol worship and child sacrifice and paganism.
[02:40:55.873 --> 02:40:57.454]  You see, it's the decisions of man.
[02:40:57.474 --> 02:41:04.957]  If you know, there's a psychoanalyst, Carl Jung.
[02:41:05.017 --> 02:41:11.200]  He wrote that the degradation of a society begins with the moral degradation of an individual.
[02:41:12.210 --> 02:41:17.875]  And so you can learn vice versa that the moral improvement of a society begins with the refinement of the individual.
[02:41:18.396 --> 02:41:26.703]  And so it's the sum total of all of our bad decisions over the last whatever period of time that has led to the slaughter of the unborn.
[02:41:27.651 --> 02:41:47.298]  The defamation and desecration of gender roles, the desecration of what marriage is, the perversion and poisoning of the youth through the public school system, which teaches debauchery and normalizes the worst behavior, immoral behavior.
[02:41:47.318 --> 02:41:51.739]  So basically, this country has drifted away from Judeo-Christian morals.
[02:41:51.979 --> 02:41:54.060]  And let's just keep it simple, the Ten Commandments.
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:42:07.567]   And so therefore, it's not surprising to me That there comes a kind of a tipping point that's crossed the threshold that's been passed through collective humanity, where God says, OK, now it's time for a cleaning.
[02:42:08.848 --> 02:42:10.129]  And I think that's what we're going through.
[02:42:10.289 --> 02:42:14.553]  And maybe the best result here is people repent.
[02:42:16.115 --> 02:42:20.519]  They return back to the umbrella of the divine will.
[02:42:21.119 --> 02:42:22.281]  They live a moral life.
[02:42:22.641 --> 02:42:23.682]  They respect life.
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:33.682]  The sanctity of life, they respect marriage, they respect children and the unborn and so on, and that could avert a major body count.
[02:42:33.802 --> 02:42:40.564]  However, regardless of whether or not people are going to realize that, the cleansing will happen.
[02:42:41.424 --> 02:42:48.346]  And so, again, every single individual right now is being given a choice, and that choice is from God.
[02:42:49.318 --> 02:42:50.340]  And here's the question.
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:51.302]  Who are you going to bow down to?
[02:42:51.683 --> 02:42:52.024]  I agree.
[02:42:52.044 --> 02:42:53.046]  Stay right there, Dr. Zlingo.
[02:42:53.066 --> 02:42:53.787]  Final segment.
[02:42:53.807 --> 02:42:55.370]  We'll talk about solutions straight ahead.
[02:42:55.390 --> 02:42:55.971]  We'll be right back.

[02:43:45.174 --> 02:43:52.475]   so close to winning. Infowarsstore.com and celebrate July 4th 1776 part
[02:43:52.475 --> 02:44:00.954]   2 against the New World Order because the answer to 1984 is 1776. When the
[02:44:00.954 --> 02:44:06.104]   president got in the beast he was under the impression from Mr. Meadows that the
[02:44:06.104 --> 02:44:09.835]   off-the-record movement to the Capitol was still possible and likely to
[02:44:09.835 --> 02:44:13.863]   happen but that Bobby had more information.
[02:44:13.035 --> 02:44:33.653]  So once the President had gotten into the vehicle with Bobby, he thought that they were going up to the Capitol, and when Bobby had relayed to him, we're not, you don't have the assets to do it, it's not secure, we're going back to the West Wing, the President had a very strong, very angry response to that.
[02:44:35.914 --> 02:44:37.456]  Tony described him as being irate.
[02:44:40.185 --> 02:44:40.605]  Gotcha.
[02:44:41.125 --> 02:44:41.545]  Good news.
[02:44:41.645 --> 02:44:43.466]  We're not going to go to the Capitol.
[02:44:43.486 --> 02:44:44.506]  We're going back to the White House.
[02:44:46.967 --> 02:44:50.608]  The President said something to the effect of, I'm fucking President.
[02:44:51.129 --> 02:44:52.429]  Take me up to the Capitol now.
[02:44:53.909 --> 02:44:58.391]  To which Bobby responded, Sir, we have to go back to the West Wing.
[02:44:59.691 --> 02:45:04.353]  The President reached up towards the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel.
[02:45:08.166 --> 02:45:09.367]  Oh, my God!
[02:45:09.607 --> 02:45:10.947]  Oh, my dear Jesus, God!
[02:45:12.248 --> 02:45:14.389]  Turn off the lights!
[02:45:14.409 --> 02:45:15.749]  Turn off the lights!
[02:45:15.829 --> 02:45:18.430]  Turn them off!
[02:45:19.791 --> 02:45:24.993]  Mr. Engle grabbed his arm, said, sir, you need to take your hand off the steering wheel.
[02:45:26.013 --> 02:45:27.894]  We're going back to the West Wing.
[02:45:28.254 --> 02:45:29.535]  We're not going to the Capitol.
[02:45:31.519 --> 02:45:35.040]  Mr. Trump then used his free hand to lunge towards Bobby Angle.
[02:45:35.420 --> 02:45:40.482]  And when Mr. Ornato had recounted this story to me, he had motioned towards his clavicles.
[02:45:41.362 --> 02:45:46.964]  And was Mr. Angle in the room as Mr. Ornato told you this story?
[02:45:47.064 --> 02:45:47.824]  He was.
[02:45:47.743 --> 02:45:54.743]   And was Mr. Engle in the room as Mr. Ornato told you this story?
[02:45:54.743 --> 02:45:56.743]  He was.
[02:45:56.743 --> 02:46:02.743]   Did Mr. Engle correct or disagree with any part of this story from Mr. Ornato?
[02:46:03.595 --> 02:46:07.257]  Mr. Engle did not correct or disagree with any part of the story.
[02:46:08.237 --> 02:46:14.480]  Did Mr. Engle or Mr. Ornato ever after that tell you that what Mr. Ornato had just said was untrue?
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:19.920]   Neither Mr. Renato nor Mr. Engel told me ever that it was untrue.
[02:46:19.920 --> 02:46:35.920]  [Music]
[02:46:36.182 --> 02:46:37.343]  I don't even know what this is.
[02:46:37.363 --> 02:46:39.244]  How did you get here?
[02:46:39.264 --> 02:46:41.265]  I just caught you, American.
[02:46:41.585 --> 02:46:43.646]  You visited Bandar Video.
[02:46:44.546 --> 02:46:47.828]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[02:46:48.147 --> 02:46:55.147]   Do what CNN says and do not visit me in the video or I have to hurt your eye.
[02:46:55.147 --> 02:47:02.147]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:47:02.347 --> 02:47:09.346]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:09.346 --> 02:47:14.346]  [Music]
[02:47:14.346 --> 02:47:16.006]  (upbeat music)
[02:47:15.964 --> 02:47:19.587]  You know, I've got another Barbara Max Hubbard quote for you.
[02:47:19.907 --> 02:47:21.408]  She's one of the gurus of Hillary Clinton.
[02:47:21.428 --> 02:47:28.393]  I think she's dead now, gone to hell, but she talks about, we are the pale horse of death, we're the New World Order, we're going to carry all this out.
[02:47:29.194 --> 02:47:30.855]  I'll pull that quote up for you coming up here.
[02:47:31.557 --> 02:47:33.258]  Just a few minutes, but I was just paraphrasing it.
[02:47:33.298 --> 02:47:38.201]  But Dr. Zelenko, medical doctor, who helped get the first treatments out to save millions of people, he's here with us.
[02:47:39.081 --> 02:47:46.285]  And I wanted to talk about where we're going here, because everything Satan does is a counterfeit.
[02:47:47.426 --> 02:47:49.807]  And so Satan says, oh, I'm going to call the people.
[02:47:49.907 --> 02:47:51.248]  I'm going to make them make the decision.
[02:47:51.348 --> 02:47:53.869]  I'm going to make them decide which side they're on.
[02:47:53.929 --> 02:47:56.591]  But then, really, that's God's plan.
[02:47:56.651 --> 02:48:00.573]  It's up to us individually to choose, not for Satan to make those choices for us.
[02:48:01.405 --> 02:48:02.986]  Here's Jack Posobiec, who's a smart guy.
[02:48:03.146 --> 02:48:10.652]  Pretty clear Biden is only crediting Trump for the vaccine to set him up to take the blame for what comes next.
[02:48:11.292 --> 02:48:14.314]  I think that's a very simple, neutral way to say it.
[02:48:14.334 --> 02:48:18.137]  And now Trump is rubbing it in after speeches in Texas, saying take the shot.
[02:48:18.197 --> 02:48:18.878]  It's totally safe.
[02:48:18.918 --> 02:48:19.518]  It totally works.
[02:48:19.538 --> 02:48:20.259]  None of that's true.
[02:48:20.779 --> 02:48:24.762]  Trump says most Americans dying are unvaccinated and encourages everyone to get the shot.
[02:48:25.282 --> 02:48:27.183]  Now he loved Dr. Zelenko's protocol.
[02:48:27.223 --> 02:48:27.784]  Help promote it.
[02:48:28.704 --> 02:48:31.105]  I think Trump just thinks doctors are trustworthy.
[02:48:31.705 --> 02:48:33.105]  He hasn't heard of Joseph Mengele?
[02:48:33.545 --> 02:48:36.566]  And I'm sorry to bring up a Nazi analogy, but it's the one that fits here, Dr. Zelenko.
[02:48:37.766 --> 02:48:38.926]  I think Trump's a good person.
[02:48:39.306 --> 02:48:42.027]  But I'm really worried about him with what he's doing here.
[02:48:42.047 --> 02:48:43.087]  I think he's being set up.
[02:48:43.107 --> 02:48:43.587]  What do you think?
[02:48:46.148 --> 02:48:50.769]  Whatever his motivations are, I have to publicly disagree with him.
[02:48:51.971 --> 02:48:52.972]  I think he's done a lot of good.
[02:48:52.992 --> 02:49:04.716]  I would say the main thing they did that was good was move the federal judiciary to the right with more than 300 justices that have Judeo-Christian values.
[02:49:05.216 --> 02:49:09.638]  I think that did help move the moral compass of this country.
[02:49:10.038 --> 02:49:14.180]  But what he's talking about when it comes to these vaccines, he really doesn't know what he's talking about.
[02:49:14.420 --> 02:49:17.221]  Or if he does, then I have a real problem with him.
[02:49:18.374 --> 02:49:20.097]  Um, he's worried about his legacy.
[02:49:20.117 --> 02:49:26.149]  You know, he's a narcissist and, and, um, what he cares about now is his, is his legacy.
[02:49:26.209 --> 02:49:27.832]  And he went warp speed.
[02:49:28.747 --> 02:49:40.076]  Um, due to political calculations, this I know for a fact, but, uh, he was going, looking into pre-hospital treatments and emphasizing that until hydroxychloroquine became politically radioactive.
[02:49:40.597 --> 02:49:51.646]  And then he made a calculation or his team got bad advice in my short that shifted him towards a warp speed, the vaccine development, because he thought that was going to help him win reelection.
[02:49:51.966 --> 02:49:56.109]  And then he went after he secured a second term, go back to pre-hospital.
[02:49:56.770 --> 02:49:57.170]  I was told.
[02:49:57.944 --> 02:50:00.025]  Pre-hospital treatment.
[02:50:00.165 --> 02:50:18.669]  Now, the reality is that the vaccines were known, the side effects were known, and the FDA knew about it, and months before they released this poisonous death shot on innocent humanity.
[02:50:19.209 --> 02:50:20.550]  That's right, I'm going to back you up.
[02:50:20.650 --> 02:50:25.171]  October, FDA, CDC documents said they knew all these things would happen that did happen.
[02:50:25.191 --> 02:50:25.671]  Please continue.
[02:50:26.765 --> 02:50:29.168]  Slide number 16, yeah, that's exactly what I was referring to.
[02:50:29.588 --> 02:50:32.471]  And so, you know, he has a choice.
[02:50:33.412 --> 02:50:35.194]  I still hope that he chooses the right thing.
[02:50:35.694 --> 02:50:50.288]  I think that the Deep State operatives like Rick Bright and Janet Woodcock, and I have evidence for all that, sabotaged his plan when he gave an order to make hydroxychloroquine available to all Americans.
[02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:57.264]  Spun it and issued an emergency use authorization that blocked access to patients that are not in the hospital.
[02:50:57.624 --> 02:51:00.946]  Exactly the opposite of what his intent was.
[02:51:01.006 --> 02:51:04.108]  And that killed 700 million people.
[02:51:04.128 --> 02:51:04.429]  Exactly.
[02:51:04.469 --> 02:51:06.490]  So how does Trump extricate himself?
[02:51:06.570 --> 02:51:10.833]  I mean, how does Trump not be set up here?
[02:51:12.494 --> 02:51:15.056]  Well, he has to recognize that he was sabotaged.
[02:51:15.356 --> 02:51:16.197]  But forget about him.
[02:51:16.397 --> 02:51:18.158]  The American people were sabotaged.
[02:51:18.538 --> 02:51:23.598]   The interests of the American people, the lives and the sanctity of the lives Our lives are desecrated.
[02:51:24.058 --> 02:51:32.344]  And so the only position that he has is to backtrack and say, yes, I had my intuition initially was correct.
[02:51:33.044 --> 02:51:36.426]  The pre-hospital approach is the right approach.
[02:51:37.067 --> 02:51:39.809]  And now we see the evidence of these vaccines.
[02:51:40.249 --> 02:51:43.371]  They don't work and they're dangerous and most people don't need them.
[02:51:43.711 --> 02:51:56.863]   So I'm pivoting now for the welfare of the I totally agree, Dr. Zelenko, and that's what I've been saying, because I know he got sucked in, but the deeper he gets sucked into this, it's a major setup.
[02:51:56.702 --> 02:52:00.702]   He has to do me a copa. He has to say I'm sorry I made a mistake.
[02:52:00.702 --> 02:52:06.702]   I totally agree Dr. Zelenko and that's what I've been saying because I know he got set up and sucked in but the
[02:52:06.702 --> 02:52:10.702]  deeper he gets sucked into this it's a major setup.
[02:52:10.702 --> 02:52:16.702]   In the time we have left the rest of this segment one more short segment with you. What do you predict for next year?
[02:52:16.657 --> 02:52:18.018]  I mean, clearly they're lining up.
[02:52:18.038 --> 02:52:20.739]  They're saying Trump supporters are going to launch terror attacks.
[02:52:20.779 --> 02:52:22.919]  The CIA is globalist controlled.
[02:52:22.939 --> 02:52:23.799]  They're wanting all this.
[02:52:24.340 --> 02:52:27.881]  They're trying to divide and conquer us along all lines.
[02:52:27.921 --> 02:52:32.862]  In fact, I was intending today, that was on my heart, to bring up how they're trying to divide Christian from Jew.
[02:52:33.301 --> 02:52:35.301]  and to get your take, but I didn't want to bring that up.
[02:52:35.301 --> 02:52:36.700]  And then you brought it up yourself.
[02:52:36.700 --> 02:52:38.381]  Clearly, we're all God's children.
[02:52:38.381 --> 02:52:40.582]  We all have God consciousness if we choose it.
[02:52:40.582 --> 02:52:42.900]  They're trying to play us off against each other.
[02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:48.941]   We have to transcend that in my mind or in my spirit, or we're going to fail because clearly they're going to use
[02:52:48.941 --> 02:52:53.020]   division going into the future along race and religion to control us.
[02:52:53.020 --> 02:52:59.422]   Listen, I've been pretty savvy and I know, listen, I love you Alex.
[02:52:59.422 --> 02:53:01.461]  You should know, I consider you a brother.
[02:53:01.978 --> 02:53:06.120]  Some of the people that listen to you have an interesting view on Jews.
[02:53:06.660 --> 02:53:17.986]  But I'm going to say something about my own religion and about my own religious institutions, and to the anti-Semites that are going to use these words, F you!
[02:53:18.006 --> 02:53:23.368]  Okay, why don't you look into your own organizations and religious structures and refine them.
[02:53:23.428 --> 02:53:39.354]   But I would say, in my own religion, it's the Organizations that are the problem, they've been corrupted by the serpent and have preached anything but God-fashioned consciousness and are coercing people.
[02:53:39.374 --> 02:53:44.396]  I know synagogues, you can't go into a synagogue unless you show proof of vaccination.
[02:53:44.456 --> 02:53:49.199]  I mean, this is the perversion of a relationship with the divine.
[02:53:49.879 --> 02:53:55.778]   And so, and I see that in Other religions as well, but I don't want to talk about other religions.
[02:53:56.119 --> 02:53:56.980]  I want to talk about my own.
[02:53:57.841 --> 02:53:59.943]  And I'm calling out my own people.
[02:54:00.503 --> 02:54:07.531]  Start living by the law and stop getting on your knees and sucking up to the corrupt government.
[02:54:08.592 --> 02:54:14.678]  And selling out the congregants and the people that have put their trust in you to help them connect to God.
[02:54:15.965 --> 02:54:18.166]  Anyway, that's my commentary on religion.
[02:54:18.186 --> 02:54:21.227]  And I was like, oh, I love you too, because I know you have God consciousness.
[02:54:21.247 --> 02:54:22.968]  My spirit feels really great when I talk to you.
[02:54:23.008 --> 02:54:23.688]  I love you too.
[02:54:24.368 --> 02:54:24.869]  Exactly.
[02:54:24.929 --> 02:54:27.930]  They have groups that have been divided and manipulated.
[02:54:28.390 --> 02:54:31.511]  And if you look at the anti-Jewish groups, they're being manipulated.
[02:54:31.551 --> 02:54:34.793]  If you look at the Jewish supremacist groups, they manipulated the black supremacist groups.
[02:54:34.913 --> 02:54:35.833]  All of it's stupid.
[02:54:36.153 --> 02:54:38.734]  There's an evil manipulating us against each other.
[02:54:38.754 --> 02:54:41.155]  And we have to transcend it or it's going to win.
[02:54:41.195 --> 02:54:42.195]  It's very simple.
[02:54:42.556 --> 02:54:43.316]  And God's watching.
[02:54:44.986 --> 02:54:53.490]  Because only when we're divided and have strife amongst us, that the enemy could then pick us off in segment.
[02:54:54.751 --> 02:55:05.756]  But if we are truly united by an overwhelming principle that transcends religion, which is actually a relationship with God, with the Divine, we're made in His image, our lives have sanctity.
[02:55:05.816 --> 02:55:08.337]  That's enough for me to call you a brother or a sister.
[02:55:08.357 --> 02:55:08.677]  That's it.
[02:55:09.238 --> 02:55:12.839]  And if we unite, and I want to tell you something, no one owns God.
[02:55:15.126 --> 02:55:18.429]  The Messiah reveals himself, and I don't care if it's the first, second, or third coming.
[02:55:20.190 --> 02:55:30.298]  Whenever the Messiah reveals himself, and the truth of the divine is revealed, I can promise you, my perception of the divine will be wrong, and so will everyone else's.
[02:55:30.598 --> 02:55:32.220]  Because the essence of God is truly hidden.
[02:55:32.720 --> 02:55:43.993]   And hopefully we will see the truth and understand The truth of what he is, but right now we're living in the dark and we're trying to approximate, guesstimate what he really is.
[02:55:44.113 --> 02:55:45.375]  No, I totally agree.
[02:55:45.435 --> 02:55:49.018]  And the New World Order and Klaus Schwab are afraid of the coming of the Messiah.
[02:55:49.498 --> 02:55:51.400]  Everything they're doing is to stop the next level.
[02:55:53.141 --> 02:55:54.222]  Because it's the death of them.
[02:55:54.242 --> 02:55:55.703]  You know, darkness goes away.
[02:55:55.723 --> 02:55:57.225]  You just turn on a little light and it goes away.
[02:55:57.725 --> 02:55:58.766]  And so they know that.
[02:55:59.026 --> 02:56:01.208]  They've dug in because they're cornered animals.
[02:56:01.669 --> 02:56:02.689]  That's when they become dangerous.
[02:56:02.709 --> 02:56:04.371]  So you're asking about what else they can do next?
[02:56:05.816 --> 02:56:12.118]  Listen, I have some intelligence assets, as you do, and some of the options are pretty unpleasant.
[02:56:12.698 --> 02:56:23.840]  Whether it's another bioterrorism attack, like the smallpox or Marburg virus, or other weapons of mass destruction that can cause further destabilization.
[02:56:24.501 --> 02:56:29.242]  And these people have no problem wasting away billions of people.
[02:56:31.311 --> 02:56:34.234]  But the reality is, I don't worry about that.
[02:56:34.774 --> 02:56:44.823]  And I have no promises or guarantees to myself or to anyone else that if you rise up and storm the beaches of Normandy of this generation, that you'll survive, especially in the first wave.
[02:56:44.843 --> 02:56:46.645]  There's a very good chance that you may fall.
[02:56:47.186 --> 02:56:48.307]  But, so what?
[02:56:49.268 --> 02:56:56.114]  You know, this is a finite life, but you have an opportunity now to connect with the infinite then, the eternal, and you have to fall in battle.
[02:56:56.154 --> 02:56:57.335]  This is a hill worth dying on.
[02:56:58.310 --> 02:56:59.751]  And so it takes courage.
[02:57:00.492 --> 02:57:05.935]  We grow up with some degree of freedom, not because of us, but because our parents and grandparents fought for it.
[02:57:06.616 --> 02:57:08.317]  The question is, will our kids be free?
[02:57:08.657 --> 02:57:10.378]  Well, the answer is, are we ready to fight for it?
[02:57:10.438 --> 02:57:11.279]  Are we ready to sacrifice?
[02:57:11.299 --> 02:57:11.599]  No, that's wrong.
[02:57:11.619 --> 02:57:13.440]  We're living off gas they put in the tank.
[02:57:14.781 --> 02:57:16.942]  So how about the next generation, our kids?
[02:57:18.063 --> 02:57:22.286]  I hope they grow up with the ability to thrive in a society of God consciousness.
[02:57:22.822 --> 02:57:23.683]  But it depends.
[02:57:23.783 --> 02:57:26.925]  Are we ready to create the environment for that to happen?
[02:57:27.305 --> 02:57:27.685]  Stay there.
[02:57:27.745 --> 02:57:28.826]  One more segment, Dr. Zelenko.
[02:57:28.846 --> 02:57:30.467]  You're absolutely right.
[02:57:30.687 --> 02:57:32.348]  The catalyst is here to go to the next level.
[02:57:32.689 --> 02:57:34.410]  We have to decide whether we're going to do it or not.
[02:57:34.430 --> 02:57:35.591]  Dr. Zelenko is our guest.
[02:57:35.611 --> 02:57:37.452]  We're going to come back to the final segment with him.
[02:57:37.812 --> 02:57:39.453]  Most powerful interview yet.
[02:57:39.553 --> 02:57:39.813]  Wow.
[02:57:40.274 --> 02:57:40.814]  And I'm not kidding.
[02:57:40.854 --> 02:57:41.434]  I woke up this morning.
[02:57:41.474 --> 02:57:42.195]  I had a dream about him.
[02:57:42.235 --> 02:57:43.436]  Couldn't remember what it was.
[02:57:43.496 --> 02:57:44.196]  I'm like, get Zelenko on.
[02:57:44.216 --> 02:57:45.257]  Usually he can't come on before notice.
[02:57:45.497 --> 02:57:46.097]  He could today.
[02:57:46.157 --> 02:57:46.958]  So this is meant to happen.
[02:57:47.258 --> 02:57:47.839]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:47.658 --> 02:57:48.858]  All right, stay with us.
[02:57:48.858 --> 02:57:53.618]  (dramatic music)
[02:57:53.618 --> 02:57:59.978]  History's happening now.
[02:58:00.225 --> 02:58:04.248]  The globalists are destroying our freedoms today, but humanity's waking up.

[03:00:02.787 --> 03:00:06.388]  One-fourth of humanity must be eliminated from the social body.
[03:00:06.488 --> 03:00:09.469]  We are in charge of God's selection process for Earth.
[03:00:09.529 --> 03:00:10.570]  He selects, we destroy.
[03:00:10.990 --> 03:00:12.710]  We are the riders of the pale horse death.
[03:00:13.270 --> 03:00:16.291]  I remember 25 years ago, I read that quote.
[03:00:16.311 --> 03:00:17.992]  I went to the library and checked it out.
[03:00:18.072 --> 03:00:18.432]  It was real.
[03:00:20.524 --> 03:00:21.945]  That's one of the top UN advisors.
[03:00:22.525 --> 03:00:24.306]  By the way, we should plug this.
[03:00:24.366 --> 03:00:25.246]  I haven't plugged any.
[03:00:25.806 --> 03:00:27.147]  Dr. Zlingo is doing such important work.
[03:00:27.187 --> 03:00:32.909]  He's got probably the best supplement out there with all the things fused into it for what you need for your body's immune system and more.
[03:00:33.270 --> 03:00:34.770]  You're insane, I think, if you don't get it.
[03:00:35.210 --> 03:00:35.831]  Z-Stack.
[03:00:35.911 --> 03:00:37.111]  Just Z-Stack.

[03:01:06.567 --> 03:01:11.090]  This is everything in one bottle, and it's very important work, and he also supports us as a sponsor.
[03:01:11.530 --> 03:01:16.593]  So check it out, zstacklive.com forward slash Alex promo code InfoWars.
[03:01:16.953 --> 03:01:18.434]  We got four minutes left, Dr. Zelenko.
[03:01:18.474 --> 03:01:19.194]  Thank you so much.
[03:01:19.214 --> 03:01:25.438]  We hope you have a great holiday coming up and a wonderful new year, and we hope to be able to talk to you, obviously, next year.
[03:01:25.458 --> 03:01:29.320]  But in the last three and a half minutes we have, what else would you like to impart to the viewers and listeners?
[03:01:31.141 --> 03:01:52.891]  First of all, I want to wish everyone happy holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and my blessing to all people, to all decent people at least, that you should have long life and good health and material and spiritual prosperity and true inner peace and tranquility and appreciate just being.
[03:01:53.051 --> 03:01:54.092]  You know, that's one thing.
[03:01:54.552 --> 03:02:00.235]  Living with a serious illness, you learn to appreciate the moment and not take it for granted.
[03:02:00.979 --> 03:02:10.382]  And interesting in this, and we've spoken about this, Alex, that in the midst of all this chaos, I found the most serenity in my life than I've ever had.
[03:02:11.123 --> 03:02:16.925]  And I think it's a certain, there's a Talmudic saying that there's no joy like the resolution of doubt.
[03:02:17.565 --> 03:02:23.207]  And since I have no doubt what reality is, and I live within the reality, that's ugly, I know, I see it.
[03:02:23.647 --> 03:02:25.428]  But nevertheless, I see the truth.
[03:02:26.088 --> 03:02:32.345]   And I I feel I know how my life fits into that process.
[03:02:32.365 --> 03:02:35.808]  I have an inner sense of clarity and purpose.
[03:02:36.569 --> 03:02:43.575]  And when I'm aligned with that, I feel the most internal, let's say, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual tranquility.
[03:02:43.695 --> 03:02:45.877]  And that's very interesting.
[03:02:46.437 --> 03:02:48.199]  And physically, I feel better now than I've ever felt.
[03:02:48.779 --> 03:02:51.762]  And so, I don't know what God's plan is for me.
[03:02:51.822 --> 03:02:52.923]  It's like this divine wave.
[03:02:53.503 --> 03:03:09.917]   But clearly, it is to Publicize the following idea that he's one, he's good, he makes us every instant in time, he loves us, and he gives us consciousness, and he gives us free choice, and really only he has free choice, right?
[03:03:10.477 --> 03:03:20.202]  No one makes him do anything, and yet he gives us that power, and that power is so amazing, but it's real, and we have to choose well.
[03:03:20.242 --> 03:03:23.904]  We have to turn away from bad and do good, and so it's really up to us.
[03:03:23.924 --> 03:03:28.227]   There's a A parable to describe the essence of evil.
[03:03:28.247 --> 03:03:31.830]  You have a king and he has a son.
[03:03:31.850 --> 03:03:33.631]  The prince is going to be king one day.
[03:03:34.432 --> 03:03:37.034]  And he loves his people and he loves his son.
[03:03:37.054 --> 03:03:41.477]  So he wants to make sure that the son is worthy of being king one day.
[03:03:41.497 --> 03:03:43.259]  So he goes to a prostitute.
[03:03:43.299 --> 03:03:47.682]  The harlot hires her and sends her to seduce his son, the prince.
[03:03:48.062 --> 03:03:48.683]  That's the story.
[03:03:48.923 --> 03:03:49.644]  So let's analyze it.
[03:03:49.684 --> 03:03:50.985]  Does the king want the son to sin?
[03:03:51.974 --> 03:03:57.980]  No, I mean, he's actually just testing the son to make sure that he has the fiber, the moral fiber to be a good king.
[03:03:58.761 --> 03:04:01.464]  The prostitute, does she want the son to sin?
[03:04:02.065 --> 03:04:04.287]  Actually, think about it, she's doing the will of the king, isn't she?
[03:04:05.649 --> 03:04:07.030]  And so in this particular, that's how I...
[03:04:07.987 --> 03:04:10.089]  Conceptualize God making free choice.
[03:04:10.549 --> 03:04:11.410]  He gives options.
[03:04:11.550 --> 03:04:15.554]  If I give you a hundred dollar bill and a dollar bill and ask you to choose, that's not much of a choice, right?
[03:04:15.974 --> 03:04:19.677]  So you need comparable options for the choice to be real.
[03:04:20.078 --> 03:04:24.942]  So God makes good and evil and they seem equally attractive and waits for our choices.
[03:04:25.502 --> 03:04:32.288]  Now if we choose evil, it's like me giving you a beautiful piece of crystal, you drop it on the floor and then cut your foot and you're bleeding.
[03:04:32.629 --> 03:04:33.890]  Was it my fault that you're bleeding?
[03:04:34.855 --> 03:04:36.316]  Or perhaps you should have been a little bit more careful.
[03:04:36.337 --> 03:04:38.238]  Beautifully said, Dr. Zelenko.
[03:04:38.358 --> 03:04:39.740]  Hopefully we get to talk to you in the new year.
[03:04:40.120 --> 03:04:40.961]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:40.981 --> 03:04:45.185]  People can find more information right now at ZStackLife.com forward slash Alex.
[03:04:45.225 --> 03:04:45.905]  God bless you, sir.
[03:04:45.765 --> 03:05:05.284]  We really appreciate you.
[03:05:05.334 --> 03:05:09.338]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[03:05:09.658 --> 03:05:18.167]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[03:05:18.527 --> 03:05:34.792]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[03:05:35.132 --> 03:05:46.176]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[03:05:46.656 --> 03:05:54.860]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[03:05:55.161 --> 03:06:00.744]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:00.663 --> 03:06:18.702]   And if I have to leave the world, I accept God's will, but I encourage and plead with
[03:06:18.702 --> 03:06:24.263]  everyone else to up your game and stand up and resist.
[03:06:24.862 --> 03:06:26.862]  [Explosion]
[03:06:26.862 --> 03:06:29.623]  (dramatic music)
[03:06:30.153 --> 03:06:35.174]  Yeah, hi, this is Dr. Zelenko, and I'm making this video from my hospital bed.
[03:06:36.114 --> 03:06:37.475]  I just want to give a quick update.
[03:06:38.295 --> 03:06:43.296]  Many, many people have expressed their love and prayers, and I'm very grateful.
[03:06:43.476 --> 03:06:43.756]  Thank you.
[03:06:46.630 --> 03:06:59.780]  Unfortunately, I had an MRI and a transesophageal echocardiogram, called a TE, and it found a tumor in my right ventricle.
[03:07:00.981 --> 03:07:05.064]  That's the lower right chamber of the heart.
[03:07:06.245 --> 03:07:08.567]  And on top of that tumor is a blood clot.
[03:07:11.829 --> 03:07:12.790]  That's not pretty good news.
[03:07:13.130 --> 03:07:14.351]  It's not good news.
[03:07:15.609 --> 03:07:23.232]  And the treatment would be to go on blood thinners, which I'm on, to try to dissolve the clot.
[03:07:23.952 --> 03:07:26.473]  And then we have to figure out what to do with that tumor.
[03:07:28.834 --> 03:07:34.096]  To be frank, if that clot breaks off, that's a ticket to the next world.
[03:07:36.857 --> 03:07:42.039]  Also, there are more tumors around my lower left lobe and my lung.
[03:07:43.999 --> 03:07:47.942]  So, I'm in a precarious situation.
[03:07:48.983 --> 03:07:57.390]  However, as King David writes, even though I walk in the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for God is with me.
[03:07:58.131 --> 03:08:03.955]  And I do really feel that way, and those words resonate in my soul more now than ever in my life.
[03:08:05.096 --> 03:08:12.142]  And there is a Talmudic teaching that even if the sword is on your neck, a person should never give up hope.
[03:08:13.280 --> 03:08:16.202]  And so I'm in a very good state of mind.
[03:08:16.222 --> 03:08:43.489]   And as I frequently said, they don't have to carry my body off the battlefield because my resolve to help humanity, the vulnerable, the innocent, decent people overcome This terrible darkness and plague that is upon us has never been stronger.
[03:08:44.450 --> 03:08:48.774]  And if I have to leave the world, I accept God's will.
[03:08:49.715 --> 03:08:58.483]  But I encourage and plead with everyone else to up your game and stand up and resist.
[03:08:59.724 --> 03:09:03.307]  Resist first within yourselves against giving in to fear.
[03:09:04.562 --> 03:09:14.509]  And then resist publicly against the policies of tyranny, which are coming again, because it's pretty obvious what's going to happen right now.
[03:09:15.510 --> 03:09:26.778]  The World Health Organization, which is essentially funded by the sociopath Gates, is gaining more and more power over sovereign nations.
[03:09:27.819 --> 03:09:33.443]  Gates messaged, I think five or six months ago, that smallpox is a big threat.
[03:09:34.372 --> 03:09:48.204]  And then, supposedly, it was eradicated in 1980, and it was only found in two labs in America and in Russia, in DSL Level 4 labs, the highest maximum security labs.
[03:09:48.664 --> 03:10:06.068]   And yet, five days after the sociopath criminal Gates said his prophetic words, a few vials of smallpox were found in an unsecure refrigerator in a Uh, Merck Laboratory in Philadelphia.
[03:10:06.948 --> 03:10:11.149]  And so, it's not surprising to me now that we're seeing monkeypox.
[03:10:12.370 --> 03:10:15.991]  Uh, I anticipate, um, global panic about it.
[03:10:16.011 --> 03:10:27.974]  This will be the next media horror narrative that, uh, will continue the fear campaign to, and lockdown campaign, and mass campaign.
[03:10:28.917 --> 03:10:39.720]  To create anxiety, isolate you from people you love, and dehumanize you with these face diapers.
[03:10:40.680 --> 03:10:45.622]  And so this is their playbook.
[03:10:46.782 --> 03:11:02.895]   And they're going to keep on sending wave after wave of their evil agenda until we Make internal resolutions to kick the evil out from within us.
[03:11:03.896 --> 03:11:28.182]   We should, in my opinion, denounce the worship of false gods, the god of technology, the god of science, the god of corrupt governments, money, power, fame, and reconcile our hearts with our creator who's making us a new Every instant in time.
[03:11:29.483 --> 03:11:31.805]  Basically, the world has now chosen sides.
[03:11:33.206 --> 03:11:41.452]  Those that will worship the machinations of man and those that will bow down to the Creator.
[03:11:42.593 --> 03:11:44.254]  And so let the calling begin.
[03:11:44.274 --> 03:11:52.761]  You know, the world needs a cleaning.
[03:11:57.736 --> 03:12:04.122]  And when the process is done, the world will be filled with the knowledge of God, just like the waters cover the seas.
[03:12:05.563 --> 03:12:08.986]  And the sociopaths have a big thing coming for them.
[03:12:09.826 --> 03:12:11.928]  They think they're gods.
[03:12:11.988 --> 03:12:13.429]  They think that they're ruling the world.
[03:12:14.750 --> 03:12:15.631]  We'll see.
[03:12:17.592 --> 03:12:18.513]  So let the games begin.
[03:12:18.533 --> 03:12:25.519]  And I have no problem falling in battle, because this is a hill that we need to dive.
[03:12:26.900 --> 03:12:32.905]  Because otherwise, our progeny will have nowhere to breathe free.
[03:12:34.586 --> 03:12:40.251]  I just came from my doctors and not good news.
[03:12:41.192 --> 03:12:48.678]  My cancer, which I've been fighting for four years, has progressed.
[03:12:50.219 --> 03:12:56.024]  There's one last ditch effort that may lead to cure, which I'm going to do.
[03:12:56.989 --> 03:13:01.671]  But if that fails, then the estimates are unpleasant.
[03:13:02.291 --> 03:13:06.012]  But I've been at this place multiple times in the last four years.
[03:13:07.392 --> 03:13:13.454]  And so when someone lives with that consciousness, something happens.
[03:13:14.054 --> 03:13:15.035]  Something very good happens.
[03:13:16.015 --> 03:13:21.157]  You kind of live each day and you appreciate time.
[03:13:22.217 --> 03:13:25.418]  And in reality, just think of it philosophically.
[03:13:25.896 --> 03:13:29.877]  You begin to die from the day you're born.
[03:13:29.897 --> 03:13:30.818]  No one lives forever.
[03:13:32.358 --> 03:13:34.799]  Some people live 20 years, some people live 100 years.
[03:13:35.279 --> 03:13:39.360]  But in the grand scheme of creation, it's finite.
[03:13:40.621 --> 03:13:44.422]  So in my opinion, it's not important when and how you die.
[03:13:46.463 --> 03:13:49.183]  It's much more important how you live.
[03:13:49.404 --> 03:13:53.665]  And so, because when and how you die is not in your control.
[03:13:55.424 --> 03:13:59.046]  But how you live is in your control.
[03:13:59.806 --> 03:14:05.369]  How you think, how you speak, and how you act is within the free will and volition of man.
[03:14:06.610 --> 03:14:15.755]  So my advice to people is appreciate the gift of consciousness in life you're being given.
[03:14:16.795 --> 03:14:20.837]  Happy birthday because every instant of time is a reactive recreation.
[03:14:21.257 --> 03:14:25.860]   It's a dynamic involvement in God's part for us to be.
[03:14:26.960 --> 03:14:32.384]  If you woke up, that's proof that he wants you to be and that you didn't finish your job.
[03:14:34.506 --> 03:14:47.795]  And I would say the world will be redeemed, affixed, rectified through acts of goodness and kindness.
[03:14:47.895 --> 03:14:52.178]  Even if the sword is on your neck, you should never give up hope.
[03:14:53.549 --> 03:14:57.034]  I do feel the sword on my neck, but I'm still very hopeful.
[03:14:58.198 --> 03:15:16.387]  And I live with more tranquility and serenity than I've ever had in my life, which is very counterintuitive, because for the carnage and the malevolence, evil that I've come into contact with in the last two years, I would not expect that type of inner peace.
[03:15:16.487 --> 03:15:27.272]   But what I've realized is that when you're in alignment, or seem to be in alignment to the divine will, There's a certain gift of tranquility that's given.
[03:15:27.552 --> 03:15:31.313]  And it's not easy, by the way.
[03:15:31.613 --> 03:15:32.733]  It's very hard, but so what?
[03:15:33.794 --> 03:15:38.195]  And it's a constant struggle, but all the suffering that I went through, I still wouldn't give it up.
[03:15:38.215 --> 03:15:45.256]  By the way, I didn't ask for this challenge, but no one asked me, so as I went through it, I am going through it.
[03:15:45.816 --> 03:15:50.856]   The serenity is really something I've been seeking my whole life. I'm very graceful to have it.
[03:15:50.856 --> 03:16:01.976]  What's important is bodily autonomy.
[03:16:02.211 --> 03:16:03.532]  The same right men have always had.
[03:16:03.712 --> 03:16:04.933]  We just want equal rights.
[03:16:05.353 --> 03:16:07.955]  The right to govern our own bodies, just like men have always had.
[03:16:08.255 --> 03:16:08.916]  It's that simple.
[03:16:09.036 --> 03:16:11.238]  Do you support the right for people to not get the COVID vaccine?
[03:16:12.338 --> 03:16:12.999]  It's irrelevant.
[03:16:14.942 --> 03:16:15.182]  Right?
[03:16:15.222 --> 03:16:16.102]  My body, my choice.
[03:16:16.122 --> 03:16:16.983]  You're right.
[03:16:17.703 --> 03:16:20.744]  It's not irrelevant.
[03:16:21.144 --> 03:16:24.985]  One of them is going to be in a pandemic state, right?
[03:16:25.025 --> 03:16:28.586]  A state of emergency, which we all know laws change during a state of emergency.
[03:16:28.606 --> 03:16:31.807]  Do you agree with the statement or the principle of my body, my choice?
[03:16:32.347 --> 03:16:33.128]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:16:33.348 --> 03:16:34.910]  Bodily autonomy is a human right.
[03:16:34.991 --> 03:16:36.252]  Healthcare is a human right.
[03:16:37.894 --> 03:16:41.899]  Access to healthcare should not be something that is dictated by the Supreme Court.
[03:16:41.719 --> 03:16:45.000]   During the pandemic, did you support people's right to not get the COVID vaccine?
[03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:52.679]  It's a difficult conversation.
[03:16:52.906 --> 03:16:55.849]  Do you support bodily autonomy in other situations?
[03:16:56.029 --> 03:17:00.233]  For example, the COVID vaccine mandates.
[03:17:00.273 --> 03:17:02.736]  We've been mandated to get vaccines for years and years and years.
[03:17:02.756 --> 03:17:05.759]  So you do support, in that situation, people not having control of their bodies?
[03:17:06.539 --> 03:17:10.123]  That's not having not control of your body.
[03:17:10.143 --> 03:17:11.284]  It's like, I don't understand.
[03:17:12.827 --> 03:17:17.128]  Do you think it is important for people to have medical and health control over their own body?
[03:17:18.169 --> 03:17:21.090]  Yeah, it's good for them, it's good for everybody.
[03:17:21.110 --> 03:17:22.510]  Do you support the mandates?
[03:17:23.751 --> 03:17:26.792]  I do support the mandates, yeah.
[03:17:26.812 --> 03:17:30.853]  Isn't that mandate that people have to get the vaccine so they don't have control over their own body?
[03:17:31.733 --> 03:17:33.054]  Vaccinations are good for people.
[03:17:34.523 --> 03:17:35.904]  In that case, you don't have control, right?
[03:17:35.924 --> 03:17:36.684]  If it's a mandate?
[03:17:36.984 --> 03:17:37.904]  No, they don't have to get it.
[03:17:38.384 --> 03:17:41.025]  They just can't go anywhere or do anything, right?
[03:17:41.145 --> 03:17:42.306]  They just can't have a job.
[03:17:42.346 --> 03:17:43.306]  You don't have a right to a job.
[03:17:43.506 --> 03:17:45.407]  Everybody should have a right to do what they want with their bodies.
[03:17:45.707 --> 03:17:49.288]  Do you support the people's right to choose not to get the COVID vaccine?
[03:17:50.289 --> 03:17:51.849]  Um, I'm not doing that.
[03:17:52.009 --> 03:17:53.270]  How many did I adopt?
[03:17:53.430 --> 03:17:54.270]  I kill my kids.
[03:17:54.090 --> 03:17:56.090]  I kill my kids.
[03:17:56.090 --> 03:17:58.090]  (explosion)
[03:17:58.090 --> 03:18:02.210]  at 4store.com.
[03:18:02.211 --> 03:18:03.551]  I love it.
[03:18:03.992 --> 03:18:06.853]  Air filters, water filters, vitamin, mineral fusion.
[03:18:06.893 --> 03:18:07.833]  My kids love it.
[03:18:07.993 --> 03:18:09.154]  Thank you, everyone.
[03:18:09.854 --> 03:18:13.036]  Cast, crew, I mean, on.
[03:18:13.116 --> 03:18:13.896]  Keep fighting, man.
[03:18:14.196 --> 03:18:14.616]  Roger.
[03:18:14.676 --> 03:18:15.597]  Keep fighting, Alex.
[03:18:15.617 --> 03:18:15.897]  Keep going.
[03:18:15.937 --> 03:18:17.118]  You got this.
[03:18:17.858 --> 03:18:20.199]  Let's go to Bo in Arizona.
[03:18:20.399 --> 03:18:21.740]  Bo, you're on Infowars War Room.
[03:18:21.780 --> 03:18:22.080]  Go ahead.
[03:18:22.588 --> 03:18:23.689]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:18:23.829 --> 03:18:27.993]  I just want to start by saying I never miss the war room every single day at 2 p.m.
[03:18:28.013 --> 03:18:28.994]  Phoenix time.
[03:18:29.715 --> 03:18:30.596]  Your buds go in.
[03:18:31.377 --> 03:18:32.818]  So you do a rockin' job.
[03:18:33.138 --> 03:18:36.762]  Thank all of you and your crew for everything you do.
[03:18:37.162 --> 03:18:38.243]  Thank you for all the supplements.
[03:18:38.784 --> 03:18:42.087]  I'm on the X2 and the vitamin infusion and the storable foods right now.
[03:18:42.107 --> 03:18:43.348]  I'm about to talk about an X3.
[03:18:43.408 --> 03:18:44.029]  You guys rock.
[03:18:44.369 --> 03:18:45.030]  There it is.
[03:18:45.330 --> 03:18:45.350]  X2.
[03:18:46.371 --> 03:18:48.354]  Survival Shield X2, a flagship product.
[03:18:48.394 --> 03:18:49.376]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[03:18:49.416 --> 03:18:50.477]  I start every morning with it.
[03:18:50.958 --> 03:18:53.262]  Exclusively available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:18:53.302 --> 03:18:56.206]  Bowie, thank you for your kind words and your support.
[03:18:56.887 --> 03:18:58.670]  Let's go to Brian in Arkansas.
[03:18:58.710 --> 03:19:00.112]  Brian, you're on the InfoWars War Room.
[03:19:00.152 --> 03:19:00.513]  Go ahead.
[03:19:00.913 --> 03:19:01.094]  Owen?
[03:19:02.261 --> 03:19:02.561]  Ryan.
[03:19:03.222 --> 03:19:03.402]  Hello.
[03:19:03.802 --> 03:19:04.162]  Hey.
[03:19:04.383 --> 03:19:04.643]  Hey.
[03:19:05.063 --> 03:19:06.604]  Good to talk to you for the second time.
[03:19:07.325 --> 03:19:11.368]  Long time listener since sometime in the Obama, early Obama era.
[03:19:13.109 --> 03:19:13.790]  Love the show.
[03:19:14.230 --> 03:19:14.991]  Love the product.
[03:19:15.691 --> 03:19:21.676]  You know, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, Living Defense, Turbo Forge, just to name a couple.
[03:19:22.096 --> 03:19:22.697]  Right on, man.
[03:19:22.737 --> 03:19:23.037]  Thank you.
[03:19:23.057 --> 03:19:23.878]  You guys do a great job.
[03:19:24.538 --> 03:19:25.938]  I think people need to support you guys.
[03:19:25.978 --> 03:19:30.960]  If you haven't spent money yet with InfoWarsTore.com and you're listening, you guys need to go spend.
[03:19:31.580 --> 03:19:32.560]  It's all good.
[03:19:32.660 --> 03:19:34.800]  Air filter, water filter, supplement, it's all good.
[03:19:35.121 --> 03:19:41.782]  Especially if you're Canadian, it costs a little bit more to bring it over the border, but you guys need to support because your guys' coverage is invaluable.
[03:19:42.282 --> 03:19:44.383]  From the bottom of my heart, I really appreciate all you guys.
[03:19:44.483 --> 03:19:47.043]  Well, we want to be here for the Canadians as well.
[03:19:48.244 --> 03:19:49.264]  We want to be here for everybody.
[03:19:49.284 --> 03:19:50.944]  That's why the crew comes here every day.
[03:19:50.984 --> 03:19:52.005]  That's why we're here every day.
[03:19:51.824 --> 03:19:53.824]  That's why Alex is here seven days a week.
[03:19:53.824 --> 03:20:07.824]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:07.824 --> 03:20:18.824]  [Music]
[03:20:19.044 --> 03:20:21.065]  Well, there have been a lot of champions.
[03:20:22.168 --> 03:20:37.401]  A lot of great men and women in the last 25, 26 months that have really exposed the evil that was this giant depopulation operation that we're still in the middle of, but that because so many people got woken to what was happening, they kind of partially pulled back their attack, their offensive.
[03:20:37.821 --> 03:20:47.980]   But out of all of them, Dr. Zelenko has been the most informative and the most accurate Dr. Vladimir Zelensky is here with us.
[03:20:48.000 --> 03:21:01.525]  He's a medical doctor, of course, that pioneered treatments that saved tens of thousands of lives in New York and his patients that then helped trigger really a therapeutic revolution of research that the entire power structure tried to block.
[03:21:01.985 --> 03:21:03.306]  And I wanted him to come on today.
[03:21:04.772 --> 03:21:09.172]   and just talk about how he was right, so he can then tell us about what he thinks is coming
[03:21:09.172 --> 03:21:10.172]  in the future.
[03:21:10.172 --> 03:21:11.611]  And he said, yeah, let's not get into me being right.
[03:21:11.611 --> 03:21:13.572]  Everybody knows what we've witnessed here.
[03:21:13.572 --> 03:21:18.813]   Let's move on to the big picture of transhumanism and some of the world economic forum people
[03:21:18.813 --> 03:21:22.291]   that are promoting statements like, why do we need so many people?
[03:21:22.291 --> 03:21:23.732]  We're about to become gods.
[03:21:23.732 --> 03:21:24.732]  Let's get rid of everyone.
[03:21:24.732 --> 03:21:30.451]   I mean, really evil, sinister stuff that you'd imagine you'd see in like a Marvel comic super
[03:21:30.451 --> 03:21:33.611]   villain, but it's actually coming out of the globalist operations.
[03:21:33.600 --> 03:21:35.861]  So I'm glad he wants to get to that, because I want his take on it.
[03:21:36.281 --> 03:21:37.541]  That was actually on my list of topics.
[03:21:37.581 --> 03:21:40.102]  So, sir, great to have you with us, Dr. Zelenko.
[03:21:40.122 --> 03:21:43.942]  Please try to cut to the heart of it, as you said you wanted to during the break when we talked.
[03:21:43.962 --> 03:21:46.203]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:21:46.243 --> 03:21:46.823]  Thanks for having me.
[03:21:47.883 --> 03:21:51.764]  So, the enemy is godless.
[03:21:52.944 --> 03:21:54.284]  Doesn't believe in an afterlife.
[03:21:55.405 --> 03:21:56.246]  But they don't want to die.
[03:21:56.266 --> 03:22:04.291]  And if you ask them what happens to consciousness after you die, they say it just ceases to be.
[03:22:05.352 --> 03:22:14.259]  And so what they're trying to do for the last 30 years is to create a way to escape death.
[03:22:14.659 --> 03:22:17.041]  I know it sounds weird, but that's exactly what they're trying to do.
[03:22:17.621 --> 03:22:26.226]   I don't think they'll succeed, But we need to understand the motivations of the enemy so that we can have a rational and good strategic response.
[03:22:27.086 --> 03:22:49.117]  And so if you listen to people like Ray Kurzweil and someone else whose name is Yuval Noah Harari, which we'll talk about more in a minute, what they're trying to do is create a inorganic, organic platform, humanoid platform, that has artificial intelligence where human consciousness could literally be downloaded into.
[03:22:50.166 --> 03:22:56.888]  And so the self-proclaimed elites will then have a platform for eternal life.
[03:22:57.648 --> 03:23:06.511]  And because they have a problem that the physical body that we live in only has a limited lifespan, 50 years, 100 years, whatever it is, it's finite.
[03:23:06.991 --> 03:23:21.358]   And so they, when this body begins to fail, they want to be able to download ...transferred their consciousness into a humanoid platform, and then eventually over time into other humanoid platforms, you know, upgrades, so to speak.
[03:23:21.918 --> 03:23:32.423]  Now, this is exactly what their agenda is, because they know that, or they believe, at least, that if they were to die, that they would cease to be.
[03:23:33.544 --> 03:23:47.664]   Now, in that worldview, they are prepared to waste 6.5 billion people, because It's completely unnecessary, useless eaters, and they don't need that many slaves.
[03:23:48.564 --> 03:23:56.449]  And so what this vaccine platform has been, these vaccines do a lot of things, except one thing, prevent COVID-19.
[03:23:57.790 --> 03:24:01.933]  There are three simultaneous capabilities that these vaccines do.
[03:24:02.474 --> 03:24:09.701]   One is population control, and that's done through four different Uh, phenomenon.
[03:24:09.802 --> 03:24:15.503]  One is a percentage of people die relatively, uh, soon after getting injected.
[03:24:15.523 --> 03:24:22.725]  Um, long term lifespans are being reduced because of chronic diseases such as cancer and autoimmune diseases.
[03:24:23.865 --> 03:24:31.567]  Um, there's miscarriage rates that are skyrocketing from 10 to 82% and actually recent DoD data, Department of Defense data, say over 300%.
[03:24:31.627 --> 03:24:32.427]  And then there's infertility.
[03:24:35.174 --> 03:24:38.377]  Well, this was predicted by the FDA in October 2020.
[03:24:38.597 --> 03:24:42.960]  This was not an accidental finding.
[03:24:43.000 --> 03:24:55.350]  This was a premeditated plan, proven by the fact that the FDA reported that this was going to happen to its scientists two months prior to the rollout.
[03:24:56.131 --> 03:24:58.513]  And now we have 15 months of data that corroborate this.
[03:24:59.213 --> 03:25:17.782]   Number two, There is an enslavement component here, a control mechanism, a 24-7 surveillance component about bringing the ability to measure biometric data under the skin and then transmit that data to a third party with your location.
[03:25:18.323 --> 03:25:50.747]   And then the linkage of that to cryptocurrency, which in 2026, according to congressional data, When Medicare begins to fail and the world economies become unstable, there will be a, even if we let a good crisis go to waste, there'll be a transition from the current economic system to a one-world cryptocurrency-based financial system, which will then create a mechanism for control of human behavior because if
[03:25:52.714 --> 03:25:58.177]  If the powers that be that control the system don't like you, they just turn off your ability to buy bread for your family.
[03:25:58.817 --> 03:26:22.288]   And then the third most sinister component to this is the transhumanist component or the ability to hack into your genetic code using an mRNA platform to deliver CRISPR-Cas9 technology and gene edit you So that you're no longer made in the image of God, but you're made in the image of Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates.
[03:26:22.308 --> 03:26:25.730]  They're literally going to re-engineer what it means to be human.
[03:26:25.750 --> 03:26:42.783]  And so this Yuval Noah Harari is a wayward Jew from Israel, professor of history at Hebrew University, and he's called a prophet by people like Klaus Schwab.
[03:26:43.551 --> 03:26:45.551]  Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg.
[03:26:45.551 --> 03:26:47.551]  They call him basically their high priest.
[03:26:47.551 --> 03:26:51.051]   And he says stuff that, quite frankly, sounds like it came out of the mouth of Hitler.
[03:26:51.051 --> 03:26:54.551]   Like, "We don't need most people. We're about to become gods. This is dangerous."
[03:26:54.551 --> 03:26:58.551]  And Obama. Obama called him his favorite author on CNN.
[03:26:58.551 --> 03:27:00.551]  And so what does this guy say?
[03:27:00.551 --> 03:27:05.551]  Well, he says that humans are hackable animals.
[03:27:05.551 --> 03:27:11.551]   And since we can hack into your genetic code, we could re-engineer it with intelligent design.
[03:27:11.551 --> 03:27:15.271]  But not with some God above the clouds and toes.
[03:27:15.248 --> 03:27:17.329]  He's the embodiment of the serpent.
[03:27:17.148 --> 03:27:23.148]   rather by human intelligent design, because we are now like gods.
[03:27:23.148 --> 03:27:25.028]  There's no such thing as a soul.
[03:27:25.028 --> 03:27:27.628]  There's no such thing as free will.
[03:27:27.628 --> 03:27:29.948]  These are just some of the tidbits of what this guy--
[03:27:29.948 --> 03:27:34.867]   This is literally Genesis out of one of the oldest Jewish books,
[03:27:34.867 --> 03:27:39.707]   telling us the serpent said it, and now he's saying it right now.
[03:27:39.707 --> 03:27:40.667]  Well, he is a serpent.
[03:27:40.667 --> 03:27:42.507]  He's the embodiment of the serpent.
[03:27:42.507 --> 03:27:48.269]   And it's very actually relieving to me that the enemy has finally
[03:27:48.269 --> 03:27:50.268]  exposed himself.
[03:27:49.780 --> 03:28:01.429]  Because he's just one little man, but he represents an ideology that we have allowed to exist through the godless vacuum that we have created in the world, in society.
[03:28:01.930 --> 03:28:13.605]   He is the inevitable outcome of a society that has Allowed for the desecration of the sanctity of life, the sanctity of marriage, and the sanctity of gender.
[03:28:14.126 --> 03:28:16.267]  You're saying we conjured him by our sin?
[03:28:19.189 --> 03:28:25.534]  We allow for darkness to exist if we do not bring light into the world.
[03:28:26.448 --> 03:28:26.848]  Powerful.
[03:28:26.888 --> 03:28:27.248]  Stay there.
[03:28:27.268 --> 03:28:31.550]  I want to get into this because I watch his whole speeches and they're so satanic.
[03:28:31.610 --> 03:28:32.450]  It makes your head spin.
[03:28:32.810 --> 03:28:34.871]  And there's Klaus Schwab drooling while he speaks.
[03:28:35.371 --> 03:28:37.972]  And so they definitely worship this guy.
[03:28:38.473 --> 03:28:41.834]  And we're going to talk about what he believes on the other side with Dr. Zelenko.
[03:28:41.854 --> 03:28:43.474]  This is so important.
[03:28:43.494 --> 03:28:45.595]  You can find Dr. Zelenko's site on screen.
[03:28:45.615 --> 03:28:47.536]  When we come back, we'll tell you about that as well.
[03:28:48.356 --> 03:28:49.617]  This is an incredible time.
[03:28:50.117 --> 03:28:51.818]  Everything is coming to a head, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:28:52.478 --> 03:28:54.939]  This is the battle of the gods, whatever you want to call it.
[03:28:54.778 --> 03:29:04.537]  it's happening. Nancy Pelosi doesn't like Hispanic children.
[03:29:02.657 --> 03:29:03.678]  Look at her nudge away.
[03:29:03.838 --> 03:29:05.079]  Mayra Flores' child.
[03:29:05.559 --> 03:29:05.899]  Let's watch.
[03:29:05.919 --> 03:29:11.282]  You know what never, ever, ever happens, ever, in the history of America?
[03:29:12.003 --> 03:29:16.485]  Is a politician caught on camera accidentally being a decent person.
[03:29:17.006 --> 03:29:18.987]  Like, when they're pretending, they're like, oh, I love you.
[03:29:19.007 --> 03:29:19.888]  Let me kiss your baby.
[03:29:20.028 --> 03:29:21.589]  Oh, look how much I love this kid.
[03:29:21.889 --> 03:29:25.291]  It's like, if they don't think the camera's rolling, it's just like, out of my way, you little rat.
[03:29:26.011 --> 03:29:26.832]  We'll get abortion.
[03:29:27.472 --> 03:29:28.173]  We'll get abortion.
[03:29:28.213 --> 03:29:29.533]  We'll go to war in Ukraine.
[03:29:30.054 --> 03:29:31.194]  We'll bomb Syria.
[03:29:32.275 --> 03:29:33.936]  We'll sell the baby body parts.
[03:29:35.397 --> 03:29:40.020]  Your child gets too close to... I guess it's better than Joe Biden.
[03:29:40.100 --> 03:29:40.480]  I don't know.
[03:29:40.600 --> 03:29:42.401]  I guess this is the Democratic...
[03:29:43.476 --> 03:29:47.876]   paradigm that they're stuck in. You either put your kid too close to Nancy Pelosi and she gets
[03:29:47.876 --> 03:29:52.356]   elbowed in the face or too close to Joe Biden and you might not ever see her again. She's
[03:29:52.356 --> 03:29:57.556]   disappeared to some basement where Hunter is waiting and smoking crack. It's liberal though.
[03:29:57.556 --> 03:30:02.195]  I'm sorry, I'm just getting in that it is in fact liberal.
[03:30:02.404 --> 03:30:03.225]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:30:03.745 --> 03:30:06.828]  Alex is on the scene here to let us know what the reality is.
[03:30:07.829 --> 03:30:08.429]  It's very liberal.
[03:30:08.449 --> 03:30:09.590]  It's very liberal.
[03:30:09.610 --> 03:30:10.471]  I mean, seriously.
[03:30:11.352 --> 03:30:15.755]  You can film me secretly all day, every day for my entire life.
[03:30:15.795 --> 03:30:18.678]  You will never see me treat a little kid this way.
[03:30:19.887 --> 03:30:24.231]  And you know, the liberals are going, well, no, it's just a little, she was positioning her.
[03:30:25.513 --> 03:30:26.394]  It's all fine.
[03:30:26.414 --> 03:30:26.934]  It's like, all right.
[03:30:27.034 --> 03:30:27.915]  Yeah, you can believe that.
[03:30:28.115 --> 03:30:28.696]  You can believe that.
[03:30:28.716 --> 03:30:37.925]  Or you can believe the reality, which is what we just saw was a flash, a brief but all so informative window into the soul of Nancy Pelosi.
[03:30:39.286 --> 03:30:42.329]  Just shove the little rugrat to the side, Nancy.

[03:32:57.075 --> 03:33:07.075]  Thank you.
[03:33:06.817 --> 03:33:08.518]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:08.518 --> 03:33:33.676]  You've all know a Harari is the high priest.
[03:33:33.750 --> 03:33:37.191]  They call him the leader, the prophet of Klaus Schwab.
[03:33:37.711 --> 03:33:39.092]  They just fall over themselves.
[03:33:39.152 --> 03:33:42.133]  I watched a video of Hollywood and Schwab.
[03:33:42.153 --> 03:33:43.353]  They just grovel to him.
[03:33:44.393 --> 03:33:47.094]  And he sits there and tells them, why do we need so many people?
[03:33:47.134 --> 03:33:48.014]  Why do we need all this?
[03:33:48.855 --> 03:33:50.295]  And this is the transhumanist cult.
[03:33:50.495 --> 03:33:53.076]  Everything they're doing is coming out of this plan.
[03:33:53.396 --> 03:33:54.657]  Here's just a few of the clips.
[03:33:54.757 --> 03:33:55.737]  You can't do it justice.
[03:33:56.257 --> 03:33:58.298]  Everything he says is just so freaking evil.
[03:33:58.318 --> 03:33:58.658]  Here it is.
[03:33:59.698 --> 03:34:06.825]  And then the big political and economic question of the 21st century will be, what do we need humans for?
[03:34:07.145 --> 03:34:10.088]  Or at least, what do we need so many humans for?
[03:34:10.108 --> 03:34:12.670]  Do you have an answer in the book?
[03:34:12.810 --> 03:34:18.555]  At present, the best guess we have is keep them happy with drugs and computer games.
[03:34:18.895 --> 03:34:20.357]  We call this the metaverse.
[03:34:20.797 --> 03:34:21.918]  What you guys do in here?
[03:34:21.938 --> 03:34:24.600]  Pretty much everything that you would do in the real world.
[03:34:24.700 --> 03:34:27.682]  Or at least, what do we need so many humans for?
[03:34:28.062 --> 03:34:30.844]  Would constitute a new useless class.
[03:34:31.164 --> 03:34:37.588]  When I say that these are useless humans, it's not from the viewpoint of the mother, of the wife, or the son.
[03:34:38.889 --> 03:34:41.890]  Or at least, what do we need so many humans for?
[03:34:42.171 --> 03:34:43.651]  First, we've got population.
[03:34:44.272 --> 03:34:46.673]  Now, the world today has 6.8 billion people.
[03:34:47.153 --> 03:34:48.734]  That's headed up to about 9 billion.
[03:34:49.354 --> 03:34:57.698]  Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, healthcare, reproductive health services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent.
[03:34:58.678 --> 03:35:01.679]  Or at least, what do we need so many humans for?
[03:35:01.879 --> 03:35:03.360]  Forget the conspiracy.
[03:35:03.520 --> 03:35:05.220]  Listen to our government agencies.
[03:35:05.240 --> 03:35:06.460]  These guys are telling the truth.
[03:35:06.821 --> 03:35:08.801]  You know, there's no conspiracy here, folks.
[03:35:08.841 --> 03:35:10.722]  Just get your damn vaccine.
[03:35:11.002 --> 03:35:12.062]  Alright, thank you, doctor.
[03:35:12.622 --> 03:35:20.225]  And COVID is critical because this is what convinces people to accept, to legitimize.
[03:35:21.325 --> 03:35:23.387]  Total biometric surveillance.
[03:35:24.128 --> 03:35:25.789]  We want to stop this epidemic.
[03:35:26.470 --> 03:35:32.015]  We need not just to monitor people, we need to monitor what's happening under their skin.
[03:35:33.716 --> 03:35:41.824]  What we have seen so far, it's corporations and governments collecting data about where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch.
[03:35:42.625 --> 03:35:47.069]  The next phase is the surveillance going under our skin.
[03:35:48.453 --> 03:35:55.578]  We now see mass surveillance systems established even in democratic countries, which previously rejected them.
[03:35:56.158 --> 03:35:59.860]  And we also see a change in the nature of surveillance.
[03:36:00.521 --> 03:36:04.023]  Previously, surveillance was mainly above the skin.
[03:36:04.663 --> 03:36:06.445]  Now it's going under the skin.
[03:36:07.529 --> 03:36:11.375]  Governments want to know not just where we go or who we meet.
[03:36:11.775 --> 03:36:15.180]  Above all, they want to know what is happening under our skin.
[03:36:15.841 --> 03:36:16.982]  What's our body temperature?
[03:36:17.423 --> 03:36:18.485]  What's our blood pressure?
[03:36:18.625 --> 03:36:20.007]  What is our medical condition?
[03:36:21.719 --> 03:36:28.365]  Now humans are developing even bigger powers than ever before.
[03:36:28.705 --> 03:36:33.630]  We are really acquiring divine powers of creation and destruction.
[03:36:34.230 --> 03:36:36.992]  We are really upgrading humans into gods.
[03:36:37.533 --> 03:36:40.756]  We are acquiring, for instance, the power to re-engineer life.
[03:36:41.696 --> 03:36:44.199]  Humans are now hackable animals.
[03:36:45.728 --> 03:37:01.760]  You know, the whole idea that humans have, you know, they have this soul or spirit and they have free will, and nobody knows what's happening inside me, so whatever I choose, whether in the election or whether in the supermarket, this is my free will, that's over.
[03:37:03.341 --> 03:37:08.065]  I mean, all this story about Jesus rising from the dead and being the Son of God, this is fake news.
[03:37:09.514 --> 03:37:21.665]  I know that in recent years we saw populist politicians undermining deliberately the trust that people have in important institutions like universities, like respectable media outlets.
[03:37:21.945 --> 03:37:30.028]   These populist politicians told people that, say, scientists are these small and apologize for judging you that it's only a small
[03:37:30.028 --> 03:37:31.988]   portion of it i want you to see
[03:37:31.988 --> 03:37:37.168]   but i was only going to talk about so what obviously listeners know this is horrific but
[03:37:37.168 --> 03:37:42.068]   what are we hearing here because this is a open my new declaration of war against our
[03:37:42.068 --> 03:37:46.449]   our very existence and hate he said your free will forget about it it's gone
[03:37:46.449 --> 03:37:51.007]   well that doesn't sound like something a good guy says to me dot is a link up
[03:37:51.007 --> 03:38:00.009]   you really want to know what motivates him So he's a brilliant man.
[03:38:00.094 --> 03:38:04.016]  I think it's important to respect your adversary and their capabilities.
[03:38:04.056 --> 03:38:05.376]  He has a PhD from Oxford.
[03:38:06.377 --> 03:38:08.658]  He's influenced the most powerful people in the world.
[03:38:09.738 --> 03:38:13.120]  But what really motivates him is something much more simple.
[03:38:14.241 --> 03:38:14.801]  He's learned.
[03:38:14.841 --> 03:38:15.981]  He knows the Bible very well.
[03:38:16.822 --> 03:38:25.346]  And if he knows the Bible very well, he knows what God says or what is stated in the Bible, what is right and what is wrong.
[03:38:26.238 --> 03:38:32.583]  Now, I'm going to say this, not because I'm placing a value judgment, but because how he interprets it.
[03:38:33.243 --> 03:38:37.306]  Now, I personally believe people can live any way they want, and it's between them and God.
[03:38:37.326 --> 03:38:39.748]  So I'm not God's policeman.
[03:38:40.429 --> 03:38:45.192]  But he's a homosexual, and he's married to someone, a man whose name is Yitzhak.
[03:38:45.813 --> 03:38:50.076]  And he knows what the Bible... He mentioned it earlier, he has real problems with it.
[03:38:50.596 --> 03:38:59.216]   He knows what the Bible says about homosexuality, it's called an abomination, and it really Really pisses him off.
[03:39:00.556 --> 03:39:04.597]  And so from his world view, it's not enough.
[03:39:05.237 --> 03:39:07.778]  Go live your life quietly any way you want.
[03:39:07.938 --> 03:39:08.138]  No.
[03:39:08.618 --> 03:39:21.421]  He decided that he's going to take on God and he's going to invalidate the concept of God in people's minds because in his world view, God cannot exist.
[03:39:22.557 --> 03:39:27.398]  Because if God exists and there's a right and wrong, then he has a big problem in his mind.
[03:39:27.738 --> 03:39:33.500]  There's this cognitive dissonance, and then there's this emotional turbulence and guilt, and he gets anxious.
[03:39:34.420 --> 03:39:51.864]  So literally the whole world has to suffer, because you will know Aurari's sexual orientation is not in line with what he read in the Bible, and therefore he has to try to destroy God-consciousness in humanity.
[03:39:53.465 --> 03:39:55.066]  I mean, that's really exactly what it is.
[03:39:55.106 --> 03:39:58.769]  They are in rebellion against the code we've been given to be successful.
[03:39:59.190 --> 03:40:00.611]  We have free will to follow it or not.
[03:40:00.991 --> 03:40:07.236]  And he has decided to not just rebel, but to go 180 degrees the opposite direction, which is extremely powerful.
[03:40:07.477 --> 03:40:08.397]  Because it's anti-Christ.
[03:40:09.078 --> 03:40:09.939]  Or it's anti-human.
[03:40:09.959 --> 03:40:11.460]  It's anti-God consciousness.
[03:40:13.481 --> 03:40:16.884]  And so, again, we're all complex beings.
[03:40:17.325 --> 03:40:18.305]  I know I'm not perfect.
[03:40:18.325 --> 03:40:19.106]  Maybe you are, Alex.
[03:40:19.166 --> 03:40:19.987]  No, I'm certainly not.
[03:40:21.306 --> 03:40:23.667]  I have my demons that I have to deal with also.
[03:40:24.268 --> 03:40:29.430]  But I do it in private, and I try to work out my relationship with God in private.
[03:40:29.890 --> 03:40:46.099]  And I'm not judging Evel Noah Harari until he takes the war against God into the world, and his policies will result in the extermination of 6.5 billion people, at least.
[03:40:46.959 --> 03:40:59.290]   And so this cannot Be allowed to go on his ideology and his arrogance to believe that human beings are now gods is
[03:41:01.460 --> 03:41:11.244]  Incompatible with decency, incompatible with societal living, incompatible with God's will, and cannot be allowed to go on.
[03:41:11.624 --> 03:41:16.806]  And doesn't the serpent say, no, not you are a God, you're going to live forever, eat of this.
[03:41:16.826 --> 03:41:22.489]  I mean, it's literally be God, take over, but it's not God because God gives us free will.
[03:41:22.789 --> 03:41:25.430]  He says you don't get free will, which proves he's not God.
[03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:27.871]  He's saying, I'm going to take your free will.
[03:41:29.915 --> 03:41:33.076]  You know, that's how the serpent seduced the woman.
[03:41:33.116 --> 03:41:39.399]  But, you know, the human being was meant to live forever.
[03:41:40.579 --> 03:41:47.902]  God said in the Bible, in Genesis, that if you were to eat from this fruit, then on that day you should surely die.
[03:41:49.083 --> 03:41:52.564]  And so there's a very interesting question that arises.
[03:41:52.984 --> 03:41:54.545]  There were two trees in the Garden of Eden.
[03:41:54.705 --> 03:41:57.026]  There was one, the tree of knowledge of good and bad.
[03:41:57.961 --> 03:41:59.701]  Which they were not supposed to eat from.
[03:42:00.542 --> 03:42:01.862]  And then there was the Tree of Life.
[03:42:03.502 --> 03:42:08.623]  And so after the sin, there is a conversation between God and His angels.
[03:42:08.643 --> 03:42:18.425]  It says, let's evict the man and his wife from the Garden of Eden, lest he eat from the Tree of Life and live forever.
[03:42:19.366 --> 03:42:20.506]  So there's an interesting question.
[03:42:20.526 --> 03:42:21.946]  He was supposed to live forever.
[03:42:22.766 --> 03:42:23.626]  And then there was a sin.
[03:42:24.667 --> 03:42:26.347]  So why not let him repent?
[03:42:27.287 --> 03:42:28.628]  And let him live forever again.
[03:42:28.848 --> 03:42:30.129]  What's the whole point?
[03:42:30.189 --> 03:42:30.989]  Why evict him?
[03:42:31.389 --> 03:42:36.152]  Why is God so concerned that he would eat from the tree of life and live forever?
[03:42:36.732 --> 03:42:38.153]  So one of the answers is the following.
[03:42:38.593 --> 03:42:45.337]  That since they ate from the tree of life, from the tree of knowledge of good and bad, evil entered them.
[03:42:47.959 --> 03:42:48.139]  Us.
[03:42:48.999 --> 03:42:50.060]  Stay there, we gotta go to break.
[03:42:50.480 --> 03:42:52.461]  We can't give evil eternal life.
[03:42:52.501 --> 03:42:53.242]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:53.402 --> 03:42:55.402]  We've thrown away our birthright, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:42:55.402 --> 03:42:58.402]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[03:42:58.402 --> 03:43:08.442]  Josh in FEMA Region 3, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:43:08.811 --> 03:43:10.411]  Alex, it's an honor to talk to you.
[03:43:10.851 --> 03:43:11.252]  Yes, sir.
[03:43:11.452 --> 03:43:13.192]  Real quick, I just want to plug X2.
[03:43:13.372 --> 03:43:15.553]  Man, I've been taking it for the last month and a half.
[03:43:15.793 --> 03:43:17.314]  It's made amazing changes.
[03:43:17.334 --> 03:43:18.534]  I've started dreaming again.
[03:43:18.775 --> 03:43:20.475]  It's just, it's amazing.
[03:43:20.775 --> 03:43:21.996]  I just feel better.
[03:43:22.116 --> 03:43:23.476]  Like, it's hard to explain.
[03:43:23.516 --> 03:43:25.577]  I feel like I'm more hydrated.
[03:43:25.637 --> 03:43:26.338]  I'm a roofer.
[03:43:26.458 --> 03:43:29.859]  It normally takes a lot of water to stay hydrated for me.
[03:43:29.959 --> 03:43:31.740]  It feels like I'm retaining water better.
[03:43:31.800 --> 03:43:33.581]  Like I said, I started dreaming again.
[03:43:33.601 --> 03:43:42.350]   I haven't had a dream in Well, this isn't some New Age thing.
[03:43:42.390 --> 03:43:43.471]  They just piggyback on it.
[03:43:43.911 --> 03:43:48.136]  The pineal gland gets filled with fluoride, and that's the third eye.
[03:43:48.216 --> 03:43:52.187]   Literally, it's connected to higher dreaming, higher consciousness medically and then obviously
[03:43:52.187 --> 03:43:55.646]   the ancient said spiritual connection and when it gets filled with fluoride
[03:43:55.646 --> 03:43:58.947]   and bromide and bromine all the bad allergens then people don't dream and
[03:43:58.947 --> 03:44:02.667]   they don't have higher consciousness statistically but real iodine goes
[03:44:02.667 --> 03:44:07.047]   through and just burns all that out it doesn't just get in there it removes the
[03:44:07.047 --> 03:44:10.507]   bad stuff in the major studies that's why everybody should get X2 we have a

[03:44:25.393 --> 03:44:37.592]   Jones grew up in a small suburb of Dallas, where even as a young man, he would act out and spin
[03:44:37.592 --> 03:44:39.592]  tall tales.
[03:44:38.986 --> 03:44:48.570]  For years, Jones has told viewers a story of why he and his family had to leave suburban Dallas, and why he's obsessed with government corruption.
[03:44:48.970 --> 03:44:51.731]  We're having an auditorium meeting about drug testing and stuff.
[03:44:52.091 --> 03:44:54.192]  They had cops up there that I knew were drug dealers.
[03:44:54.292 --> 03:44:56.393]  I stood up and I said, I was at a pool party.
[03:44:56.753 --> 03:44:59.094]  He was selling cocaine in ecstasy last week.
[03:45:00.285 --> 03:45:04.447]  They took me in an office, ran my head in the wall, told me, we're gonna kill you.
[03:45:04.487 --> 03:45:06.429]  They said, you're gonna move out of this town right now.
[03:45:06.989 --> 03:45:08.790]  That's the feathers thing from the truth.
[03:45:10.271 --> 03:45:22.078]  This morning, a Rockwall grand jury took evidence from that investigation and decided to charge two-term sheriff John McWhorter with stealing 90 pounds of marijuana out of his own department's property room.
[03:45:22.338 --> 03:45:25.940]  They charged his chief deputy, James David Knight, was in on it with them.
[03:45:26.099 --> 03:45:32.099]   The grand jury charges the two then sold that marijuana and stole some cash out of the property room as well.
[03:45:32.099 --> 03:45:37.099]   Then to cover their tracks, the grand jury charges McWater falsified records.
[03:45:37.099 --> 03:45:45.099]  I can unequivocally deny that that ever happened.
[03:45:45.099 --> 03:45:53.099]   All told, the two are charged with stealing over $50,000 in drugs and currency from the property room.
[03:45:52.765 --> 03:46:00.227]  Rockwall prosecutor Ray Sumro says the theft and corruption started back in 1985 and continued until January of this year.
[03:46:00.587 --> 03:46:04.969]  We believe that there may be other persons involved.
[03:46:05.029 --> 03:46:09.150]  At this time we have no information that would be other persons in law enforcement.
[03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:12.869]  Put another nickel in the Alex Jones was right jar.
[03:46:12.869 --> 03:46:18.309]  [MUSIC]
[03:46:18.309 --> 03:46:26.708]   Folks, I believe that love is the answer, but you ought to own a handgun just in case.
[03:46:26.708 --> 03:46:34.789]  [MUSIC]
[03:46:34.789 --> 03:46:37.212]  For the longest, man, I try to tell you Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:37.292 --> 03:46:39.574]  If we're going down, we ain't going down without a fight.
[03:46:39.594 --> 03:46:40.575]  But we ain't going down.
[03:46:40.595 --> 03:46:42.257]  The globalists are going down, that's right.
[03:46:42.377 --> 03:46:44.780]  You can see into the future watching Alex Jones tonight.
[03:46:44.860 --> 03:46:46.021]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:46.041 --> 03:46:47.442]  Yeah, Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:47.462 --> 03:46:48.564]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:48.624 --> 03:46:50.165]  Yeah, Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:50.285 --> 03:46:51.086]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:51.166 --> 03:46:52.548]  Yeah, Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:52.568 --> 03:46:53.609]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:53.669 --> 03:46:55.050]  Yeah, Alex Jones was right.
[03:46:55.070 --> 03:46:56.632]  There's a war on for you, man.
[03:46:56.692 --> 03:46:57.473]  It's time to win it.
[03:47:02.190 --> 03:47:06.273]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:06.592 --> 03:47:08.592]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:08.592 --> 03:47:18.431]  [Music]
[03:47:18.260 --> 03:47:23.260]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:23.260 --> 03:47:25.260]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:47:25.260 --> 03:47:29.260]  ZDtalkslife.com is the website.
[03:47:29.801 --> 03:47:31.762]  Dr. Vladimir Zelinko is our guest.
[03:47:32.623 --> 03:47:33.864]  He'll tell us a little bit in the next hour.
[03:47:33.884 --> 03:47:35.785]  We have another special guest joining us as well.
[03:47:35.825 --> 03:47:38.848]  But doctor, lay it out for people because you're absolutely right.
[03:47:39.308 --> 03:47:42.370]  The ancient things we heard about are exactly what's currently happening now.
[03:47:43.892 --> 03:47:45.593]  Where do you see all this going?
[03:47:45.793 --> 03:47:48.455]  How should we respond to this?
[03:47:49.035 --> 03:47:50.757]  What other knowledge do you want to lay out for people?
[03:47:53.259 --> 03:47:54.800]  I'm optimistic about the future.
[03:47:55.575 --> 03:47:57.716]  I think the true narrative will be revealed.
[03:47:59.277 --> 03:48:00.678]  But let me tell you something very serious.
[03:48:01.078 --> 03:48:04.400]  The only unknown variable here is the body count until we get there.
[03:48:06.301 --> 03:48:17.128]  And we can mitigate that carnage by spreading the true narrative and giving people the right information so they can make good choices.
[03:48:17.968 --> 03:48:25.930]   Everyone has an absolute right To see both aspects or all the options or all the information about an issue.
[03:48:26.550 --> 03:48:41.123]  What the media has done and what the censorship has done is only given one aspect of one perspective, which has led people to make terrible choices and choices that essentially they choose to walk into a extermination chamber.
[03:48:42.724 --> 03:48:57.578]   And so by spreading the true narrative, or at least Another perspective, then people can use their intellectual powers of analytical thought, deductive reasoning, and come to a decision.
[03:48:58.018 --> 03:48:59.859]  Whatever decision they make, it's on them.
[03:48:59.879 --> 03:49:01.780]  You know, we have free choice.
[03:49:01.940 --> 03:49:02.920]  That's very important.
[03:49:03.260 --> 03:49:07.982]  See, God, the way he created the world, he gave us two very precious gifts.
[03:49:08.702 --> 03:49:12.804]  One is consciousness of self, and two is free choice.
[03:49:13.364 --> 03:49:16.986]  Those are two uniquely divine characteristics.
[03:49:17.779 --> 03:49:21.981]  Now, for choice to exist, there has to be options.
[03:49:22.221 --> 03:49:28.184]  Now, listen, if I gave you a $100 bill and a dollar bill and asked you to choose, really it's not a choice, is it?
[03:49:28.644 --> 03:49:31.386]  Because one is much more attractive than the other.
[03:49:32.066 --> 03:49:41.971]  And so, for real choice to exist, there has to be two options that are comparable, perceived as real.
[03:49:42.851 --> 03:49:46.233]  And so, good and evil are very real.
[03:49:47.245 --> 03:49:48.585]  In the consciousness of man.
[03:49:49.526 --> 03:49:53.687]  But again, the idea is that... I'll give you a parable that's used a lot.
[03:49:54.187 --> 03:49:57.427]  That there's a king and he has a son.
[03:49:58.068 --> 03:49:59.528]  And the prince is meant to be king.
[03:50:00.488 --> 03:50:02.189]  But the king loves his people.
[03:50:02.629 --> 03:50:11.771]  So he wants to make sure that the prince is a proper moral fiber that he's fitting to rule the people.
[03:50:12.431 --> 03:50:15.812]  And so he hires or he gets a prostitute.
[03:50:16.494 --> 03:50:20.356]  And orders the prostitute to seduce the prince.
[03:50:21.216 --> 03:50:22.377]  That's the parable.
[03:50:22.557 --> 03:50:24.938]  If we analyze it, I'll ask you a simple question.
[03:50:24.958 --> 03:50:26.699]  Does the king want the prince to sin?
[03:50:26.719 --> 03:50:26.759]  No.
[03:50:26.779 --> 03:50:31.601]  Does the prostitute want the prince to sin?
[03:50:32.261 --> 03:50:34.282]  Actually, in many ways, she's doing the will of the king.
[03:50:35.322 --> 03:50:37.463]  And so, the answer is also no.
[03:50:38.384 --> 03:50:43.526]  And so, God creates options, but it doesn't mean that he wants us to choose the dark side.
[03:50:44.346 --> 03:50:47.488]  He wants us to turn away from bad and to choose Him.
[03:50:48.809 --> 03:50:59.817]  And by doing that, we earn for ourselves the ultimate relationship and oneness with Him, with the Eternal, with the Infinite.
[03:51:00.518 --> 03:51:07.683]  And that's amazing, because during a finite life of a few number of years, we have an opportunity to connect to the Eternal.
[03:51:08.003 --> 03:51:08.283]  Wow!
[03:51:08.363 --> 03:51:09.424]  It's really amazing.
[03:51:09.984 --> 03:51:13.762]   And so, That's the game that we're playing, and so it's a real game.
[03:51:14.442 --> 03:51:16.463]  And that's what's crazy, Dr., to interrupt real quick.
[03:51:17.124 --> 03:51:20.705]  Everything the New World Order transhumanist does, like, follows Genesis.
[03:51:21.345 --> 03:51:22.886]  And, like, we're gonna make you live forever.
[03:51:22.986 --> 03:51:25.667]  Just do what we say, and you're gonna have this knowledge.
[03:51:25.687 --> 03:51:27.048]  But, oh, everybody else can't do it.
[03:51:27.088 --> 03:51:28.188]  You gotta kill all these people.
[03:51:28.208 --> 03:51:31.910]  I mean, it's so obvious that it's literally being fulfilled.
[03:51:31.970 --> 03:51:32.670]  It's powerful.
[03:51:34.071 --> 03:51:38.753]  You know, the New World Order is a rebranding of the oldest World Order.
[03:51:39.404 --> 03:51:42.466]  of paganism, idolatry and child sacrifice.
[03:51:42.846 --> 03:51:43.647]  There's nothing new here.
[03:51:43.667 --> 03:51:49.551]  These, they call themselves elites or globalists or illuminated people.
[03:51:49.951 --> 03:51:54.314]  They're nothing more than just devolved pagans of yesteryear.
[03:51:54.954 --> 03:51:59.337]  And so it's very obvious what they are.
[03:51:59.878 --> 03:52:17.640]   The problem is we have become complacent and we have allowed for, through our choices, for the Slaughtering of the unborn, desecration of marriage, desecration of gender, and blasphemy of the Creator.
[03:52:18.841 --> 03:52:19.821]  And what do you think?
[03:52:19.841 --> 03:52:21.322]  That's going to bring blessing into the country?
[03:52:22.183 --> 03:52:30.089]  And so what we need to do is reconcile en masse with our Creator.
[03:52:31.210 --> 03:52:44.369]   When we cross a certain threshold of human hearts reconciling, With their Creator, with our Creator, then there'll be a real shift, a real new world.
[03:52:44.389 --> 03:52:44.749]  That's right.
[03:52:44.789 --> 03:52:52.534]  We have to, through free will, choose God, God-consciousness, say we're sorry, ask God to help us, and that's when things start to change.
[03:52:53.614 --> 03:52:53.974]  Exactly.
[03:52:54.154 --> 03:52:58.957]  And the best way to do that is to live by an example.
[03:52:58.977 --> 03:53:01.498]  You know, you can't preach to others and not do it yourself.
[03:53:01.558 --> 03:53:17.206]   So, I found that the people that I'm drawing To most, those that really are humble and work on themselves and find a certain degree of serenity and tranquility, which is extremely attractive, and especially in a world of chaos.
[03:53:17.646 --> 03:53:19.706]  And it makes me curious, what do they know that I don't?
[03:53:20.406 --> 03:53:23.887]  And so that draws me in into a process of self-retirement.
[03:53:24.628 --> 03:53:34.655]   So the problem is with modern-day institutions, whether it's religious, academic, Political, industrial, it doesn't really matter.
[03:53:34.695 --> 03:53:36.856]  They're all corrupted by the same serpent.
[03:53:37.837 --> 03:53:40.860]  Anything that's institutionalized has been hijacked.
[03:53:41.681 --> 03:53:52.891]  And so it's most tragic when it's in the religious realms because they, actually what they do, the one place of salvation is used to desecrate in the name of God and enslave people.
[03:53:53.835 --> 03:54:03.357]  I'll only talk about my religion because I don't feel comfortable talking about others, but I've seen such tyranny in the last two years within the Jewish faith.
[03:54:03.377 --> 03:54:07.438]  You know, people couldn't go to... Well, I mean, look at Israel.
[03:54:07.478 --> 03:54:10.418]  There's obviously a new extermination going on.
[03:54:10.458 --> 03:54:11.179]  It's so obvious.
[03:54:12.339 --> 03:54:13.119]  What's happening there?
[03:54:13.299 --> 03:54:14.499]  You've talked about that.
[03:54:14.519 --> 03:54:21.441]  The most oppressed people right now in the world under COVID tyranny are Israel and then Australia and maybe Austria.
[03:54:21.481 --> 03:54:22.681]  What's happening there?
[03:54:23.991 --> 03:54:27.703]  Well, half of Israel has AIDS and vaccine-induced.
[03:54:29.007 --> 03:54:30.328]  Immune deficiency syndrome.
[03:54:30.528 --> 03:54:31.369]  I didn't say HIV.
[03:54:31.389 --> 03:54:32.610]  They don't have HIV.
[03:54:33.150 --> 03:54:44.337]  But half of Israel, their immune systems, their innate immune systems, their T cell function, natural killer cell function, macrophages, tumor suppressor genes.
[03:54:44.577 --> 03:54:48.900]  So why again is the globalist force attacking the Jews?
[03:54:48.940 --> 03:54:49.760]  Because I mean it really is.
[03:54:49.780 --> 03:54:51.381]  You can see it right there.
[03:54:51.421 --> 03:54:54.703]  Like literally the main attack out of everywhere is Israel.
[03:54:54.763 --> 03:54:57.425]  That's where they're like on their fifth and sixth shots right now.
[03:54:59.977 --> 03:55:04.661]  So I always delineate the state of Israel from the biblical people of Israel.
[03:55:05.441 --> 03:55:06.402]  The two different entities.
[03:55:06.422 --> 03:55:16.850]  The state of Israel is a secular socialist entity and the Jewish people biblically have been tasked with the role of being a light unto the nations.
[03:55:17.030 --> 03:55:25.537]  And so, you're going to tell me if I'm wrong, good Jews have been led there to try to be close to God, but the evil runs the political system and is now going to try to kill them.
[03:55:27.278 --> 03:55:32.285]   Oh yes, I really think that what Hitler started the Israeli government disfinition.
[03:55:32.945 --> 03:55:33.805]  Wow.
[03:55:34.266 --> 03:55:35.146]  That's what I see as well.
[03:55:35.186 --> 03:55:36.286]  This is so diabolical.
[03:55:36.606 --> 03:55:38.147]  What would you advise Israelis to do?
[03:55:41.368 --> 03:55:41.808]  Revolt.
[03:55:43.108 --> 03:55:43.689]  Civil war.
[03:55:45.229 --> 03:55:47.310]  To not comply with mandates.
[03:55:47.630 --> 03:55:53.572]  By the way, I'm talking about my own brothers and sisters, literally, who have been enslaved and poisoned.
[03:55:54.543 --> 03:55:56.284]  I mean, this is not theoretical.
[03:55:56.644 --> 03:55:58.144]  These are my relatives.
[03:55:58.304 --> 03:56:00.545]  Oh, I've had family die of the shot, Dr. Zelenko.
[03:56:00.625 --> 03:56:01.305]  I know, it's real.
[03:56:05.867 --> 03:56:10.708]  So, I think that family nowadays is a different concept.
[03:56:11.388 --> 03:56:16.810]  Family, I would define as those people that are ideologically or theologically aligned.
[03:56:18.085 --> 03:56:29.071]  In trying to live in a world of God consciousness and try to maintain the possibility of true freedom in this world.
[03:56:29.091 --> 03:56:39.277]  And the people that are walking away from God consciousness are choosing to enslave themselves to really sociopaths and they become codependent on this cult.
[03:56:40.776 --> 03:56:44.078]  There's only one free type of person in this world, Alex, in my opinion.
[03:56:44.218 --> 03:56:47.059]  Someone who chooses to be a servant of God.
[03:56:47.079 --> 03:56:47.880]  That's right.
[03:56:50.001 --> 03:56:51.601]  The operative word here is chooses.
[03:56:52.342 --> 03:56:56.044]  And so, I think each human being is being tested.
[03:56:56.784 --> 03:56:57.645]  We are being tested.
[03:56:57.965 --> 03:56:59.746]  God is the floodwaters arising.
[03:57:00.606 --> 03:57:02.647]  And this time around, God is saying, get on the ark.
[03:57:03.287 --> 03:57:04.088]  You don't have to drown.
[03:57:05.390 --> 03:57:07.211]  But, uh, the world will be cleaned up.
[03:57:07.251 --> 03:57:08.831]  There's no doubt about it.
[03:57:09.071 --> 03:57:09.632]  Oh, I agree.
[03:57:09.692 --> 03:57:11.072]  This thing's not going to succeed.
[03:57:11.592 --> 03:57:17.775]  Dr. Zalinko, you know, we've got ZDtoxlife.com forward slash Alex with your great product for your immune system, your body.
[03:57:18.115 --> 03:57:18.835]  I want to promote that.
[03:57:18.855 --> 03:57:21.276]  I know you didn't come on about that, but you just do a great job.
[03:57:21.316 --> 03:57:23.617]  You were the pioneer of putting things out to protect people.
[03:57:24.017 --> 03:57:28.079]  Now, more than ever, they should at ZDtoxlife.com forward slash Alex.
[03:57:28.119 --> 03:57:31.620]  We'll also post it, the live show feed under the show right now.
[03:57:31.640 --> 03:57:36.644]   But I want to come back and just ask you about What you see coming next and how we get prepared.
[03:57:37.044 --> 03:57:43.813]  Final segment straight ahead and then we have the big lawyer that's been getting all these big events going, exposing the mass murder.
[03:57:44.414 --> 03:57:45.735]  Joining us, Mr. Fulming.
[03:57:46.176 --> 03:57:47.057]  That's coming up as well.
[03:57:47.097 --> 03:57:47.498]  Stay with us.
[03:57:50.495 --> 03:57:56.402]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[03:57:56.943 --> 03:58:00.327]  And if we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[03:58:01.208 --> 03:58:04.912]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare.
[03:58:05.633 --> 03:58:07.895]  And that alone is something to be grateful for.
[03:58:08.576 --> 03:58:15.744]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of your taps getting shut off.
[03:58:16.465 --> 03:58:21.190]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[03:58:21.951 --> 03:58:28.058]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider stocking up for your neighbors.
[03:58:29.139 --> 03:58:38.824]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[03:58:39.404 --> 03:58:43.066]  Whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[03:58:44.286 --> 03:58:47.007]  Stock up now at preparetoday.com.
[03:58:51.778 --> 03:58:59.889]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil is known to be so good for your brain, so good for your heart, so good for your cells, your cardiovascular system.
