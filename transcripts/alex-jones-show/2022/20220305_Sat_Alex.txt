[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]  and human liberty.
[00:00:11.452 --> 00:00:12.774]  We are the InfoWars.
[00:00:14.857 --> 00:00:15.799]  InfoWars.
[00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:22.978]  the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:22.978 --> 00:00:29.978]   For years now, Russia has made verifiable claims that the US is a terrorist organization.
[00:00:29.978 --> 00:00:31.978]  defiable claims that the U.S.
[00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:35.986]  is running secret biological weapons labs around their borders.
[00:00:36.847 --> 00:00:42.171]  And while Western media now claims this to be misinformation, back in 2013, they reported on it.
[00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:56.387]  While the United States and Murder Incorporated have been waging illegal wars all across the world in the name of democracy, Russia has been quietly selling energy and minding their own business.
[00:00:56.808 --> 00:01:03.632]  And according to National Geographic, this was the reason why the Pentagon was building these bioweapons labs in the first place.
[00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:08.054]  Because Russia was entirely quiet on the subject, and the U.S.
[00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:09.375]  wanted to get ahead of them.
[00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:14.647]  The initial biolab in Kazakhstan was built by the U.S.
[00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:29.330]  for $100 million to store high-risk diseases such as plague and anthrax and was hoping to attract scientists who might otherwise create biological weapons of mass destruction for someone else.
[00:01:30.491 --> 00:01:34.593]   In order to keep the world safe, The U.S.
[00:01:34.774 --> 00:01:37.536]  has since built several labs in Kazakhstan.
[00:01:38.377 --> 00:01:42.961]  Most recently, a biosafety level 4 lab to be completed in early 2022.
[00:01:45.383 --> 00:01:57.393]  As early as 2004, the Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA, began creating a network of biolabs for infectious diseases in Uzbekistan.
[00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:05.918]  And within a few years after operations began, outbreaks of unknown diseases were reported in the same areas as the labs.
[00:02:07.118 --> 00:02:10.020]  In Georgia, leaked documents show that the U.S.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.184]  Embassy has been transporting deadly pathogens and human blood as diplomatic cargo, in a scheme where private U.S.
[00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:20.765]  contractors working for three different U.S.
[00:02:20.845 --> 00:02:24.467]  biolabs have been given diplomatic immunity to do so.
[00:02:26.184 --> 00:02:33.054]  Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, AtWarClandestine released a video with maps of U.S.
[00:02:33.134 --> 00:02:40.344]  biolabs matching up with maps of the recent attack, suggesting that Russia was securing these top-secret biolabs.
[00:02:41.585 --> 00:02:45.428]  Western media claims this is false, but fails to debunk it.
[00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.591]  And once the video goes viral, the U.S.
[00:02:48.691 --> 00:02:53.095]  Embassy in Ukraine is caught deleting evidence of these labs from their website.
[00:02:53.855 --> 00:03:01.341]  But not before an independent journalist was able to copy documents showing 11 Ukrainian biolabs funded by the Pentagon.
[00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:05.507]  The Russian Embassy to Bosnia has accused the U.S.
[00:03:05.828 --> 00:03:14.241]  of filling Ukraine with biolabs, which were very possibly used to study methods for destroying the Russian people at the genetic level.
[00:03:15.481 --> 00:03:21.245]  And we now know that these so-called mRNA vaccines are destroying people at the genetic level.
[00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:25.828]  We now officially know that COVID-19 is a man-made bioweapon.
[00:03:26.328 --> 00:03:31.451]  We know that it was funded by elements of the NIH and Peter Daszak's EcoHealth Alliance.
[00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:34.053]  We know that it was made in Wuhan, China.
[00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:37.959]  And so, what isn't threatening about the U.S.
[00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.723]  encircling Russia with top-secret biolabs?
[00:03:41.764 --> 00:03:51.335]  And who on Earth thinks it's a coincidence that everyone involved in the United Nations' Great Reset are now the Ukraine's greatest allies of all time?
[00:03:52.496 --> 00:03:58.700]  The mercenaries and war profiteers in America are getting excited about making short-term profits off the dead.
[00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:09.407]  But the only ones who will benefit from this war are the crooks at the top, who have been caught committing the most heinous crime against humanity in all of recorded history.
[00:04:10.428 --> 00:04:14.291]  And the only righteous way out of this is to hold these crooks accountable.
[00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:18.313]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:22.861 --> 00:04:24.942]  We're looking at a giant war in February right now.
[00:04:25.062 --> 00:04:38.170]  Currently, that's the projections with the top people on the Earth who claim they're not with the New World Order Combine.
[00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.251]  Is war in February.
[00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:43.271]   right now? Currently that's the projections with the top people on the
[00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:48.571]   earth who claim they're not with the new world order combine. He is war in
[00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:55.071]   February and this is the type of time like right before World War one right
[00:04:55.071 --> 00:04:59.590]  before World War two when everything kicks off.
[00:04:58.406 --> 00:05:03.753]  Top officials of leading NATO countries are making aggressive statements about our country.
[00:05:05.902 --> 00:05:13.927]  Therefore, I'm ordering the Minister of Defence and the Chief of the General Staff to put the Strategic Nuclear Forces on special alert.
[00:05:14.087 --> 00:05:16.668]  The President's saying these missiles are unstoppable.
[00:05:16.868 --> 00:05:24.973]  They can go anywhere, they can deliver a nuclear warhead to any part of the world, they can fly forever, and there's nothing anyone can do about them.
[00:05:25.393 --> 00:05:29.175]  Plus, we can launch them in any number of different ways.
[00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:30.975]  We can launch them off aircraft carriers.
[00:05:31.375 --> 00:05:34.997]  We even have an underwater drone, which is going to be undetectable.
[00:05:35.757 --> 00:05:42.360]  And then, it was almost as if he was turning to the West and said, you haven't listened to us, well you have to listen to us now.
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.901]  Russia lost 20 million people.
[00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:46.442]  In World War II.
[00:05:47.143 --> 00:05:48.724]  And so it is in the consciousness.
[00:05:48.764 --> 00:05:49.625]  And that's what Putin said.
[00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:51.847]  He said, people always try to bully us.
[00:05:51.867 --> 00:05:53.268]  They always come up on our borders with weapons.
[00:05:53.668 --> 00:05:56.591]  And for the first time ever, Russia is not going to wait until you attack.
[00:05:56.971 --> 00:05:58.613]  And if you want to have a nuclear war, let's go ahead and have it.
[00:05:59.213 --> 00:06:01.275]  He also says you want to sexualize our children.
[00:06:01.295 --> 00:06:02.336]  You're a bunch of pedophiles.
[00:06:02.817 --> 00:06:04.478]  Hollywood's a bunch of devil worshippers.
[00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:07.361]  You want to destroy men and women in the family.
[00:06:07.421 --> 00:06:08.021]  And we're done.
[00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:09.122]  You want a nuclear war?
[00:06:09.162 --> 00:06:09.803]  Let's just have one.
[00:06:10.023 --> 00:06:11.024]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:06:15.163 --> 00:06:17.664]  I don't know what we're supposed to say at this point.
[00:06:19.524 --> 00:06:23.225]  But the Russians know that Hollywood and the left is not America.
[00:06:23.585 --> 00:06:24.586]  It is a disease.
[00:06:25.386 --> 00:06:26.166]  It is a cancer.
[00:06:26.206 --> 00:06:29.367]  But nevertheless, that cancer hijacked and stole the election.
[00:06:30.147 --> 00:06:33.568]  And that cancer has the nuclear weapons and all the space spacecraft.
[00:06:33.588 --> 00:06:34.668]  And the Russians aren't stupid.
[00:06:34.968 --> 00:06:37.289]  They know they'll only get off a fraction of their nukes in a war.
[00:06:37.809 --> 00:06:39.670]  It'll be enough to totally destroy North America.
[00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.919]   There are many different ways in which this conflict could spiral into a broader war between NATO
[00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:46.889]  and Russia.
[00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:51.889]   And both sides have military doctrine that allows them to use nuclear weapons
[00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:55.889]  in the event that they are losing a conventional battle.
[00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:59.889]  And so there's a real potential here for this to take place.
[00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.889]   Russia shall reserve the right to use nuclear weapons in the event of aggression
[00:07:04.889 --> 00:07:08.889]  when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy.
[00:07:08.889 --> 00:07:14.889]   And that's why all the billionaires, all the big insiders, have already hightailed it out of the United States.
[00:07:14.948 --> 00:07:16.529]  They're all gone right now.
[00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:17.330]  Almost all of them.
[00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.851]  They're in New Zealand.
[00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:19.752]  They're in Australia.
[00:07:20.632 --> 00:07:25.736]  They're up near the Arctic Circle in different bases in northern Canada.
[00:07:26.156 --> 00:07:27.858]  They're underground right now.
[00:07:28.118 --> 00:07:29.379]  It's a Slavic civil war.
[00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:33.422]  Everybody should just stay the hell out of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:33.802 --> 00:07:34.483]  Make no mistake.
[00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:45.536]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia.
[00:07:46.777 --> 00:07:50.619]  And the foundation has been functioning ever since.
[00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:55.002]  And it played an important part in events now.
[00:07:55.342 --> 00:08:05.688]  When I mention now names like Mrs. Merkel, even Vladimir Putin and so on, they all have been young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[00:08:06.048 --> 00:08:14.093]  And Biden, as the Vice President says, that he basically puppet controls the new regime there after they overthrew the elected government.
[00:08:14.373 --> 00:08:17.575]  Here he is bragging to the world that they own Ukraine.
[00:08:17.775 --> 00:08:19.216]  We're not going to give you the billion dollars.
[00:08:20.117 --> 00:08:22.378]  They said, you have no authority, you're not the president.
[00:08:22.398 --> 00:08:23.819]  The president said, I said call him.
[00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.411]  I said, I'm telling you, you're not getting a billion dollars.
[00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:29.372]  I said, you're not getting a billion.
[00:08:29.412 --> 00:08:31.673]  I'm going to be leaving here, I think it was, what, six hours?
[00:08:31.753 --> 00:08:33.274]  I looked, I said, I'm leaving in six hours.
[00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:36.175]  If the prosecutor's not fired, you're not getting the money.
[00:08:36.875 --> 00:08:37.776]  Oh, son of a bitch.
[00:08:38.316 --> 00:08:39.857]  You got fired.
[00:08:40.097 --> 00:08:41.557]  If the prosecutor's not fired.
[00:08:42.618 --> 00:08:53.706]   So, they make all these thug claims, act all tough, ship in $10 billion of weapons, $5 billion in the last year, Attack all these Russian held areas and the Russians are just like okay.
[00:08:53.886 --> 00:09:28.010]   I mean, I guess we'll attack back And I do not support Russia's invasion of Ukraine I didn't support all these other countless wars launched by other countries as well But you can see where all of this is leading the world into a world economic collapse that's already been triggered, that's already been set in motion, that will now be blamed on COVID-19, and of course the conflict in Eastern Europe, in the border regions of Russia.
[00:09:29.871 --> 00:09:32.834]  Obviously I'm going to be going over all of this news in this live.
[00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:36.096]  Saturday, March 5th, 2022.
[00:09:36.797 --> 00:09:38.817]  Transmission from 3 to 5 p.m.
[00:09:39.477 --> 00:09:45.539]  Central after this two hours of live uncensored news and information.
[00:09:46.239 --> 00:09:47.299]  Analysis is over.
[00:09:47.439 --> 00:09:50.880]  It will restream at InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:10:01.187]   And I hope you'll continue to do your part overriding the censors and that you will share The live feed, you will share the archive feed.
[00:10:01.227 --> 00:10:09.048]  We're restreaming and you will share the archive of this two-hour emergency broadcast with everyone you know from Band.Video.
[00:10:09.947 --> 00:10:16.187]   Putin has warned that any no-fly zone in any country entering militarily will be counted as an act of war,
[00:10:16.187 --> 00:10:24.587]   and that the exact second, the very second that any nation joins in with Ukraine in attacking Russian forces,
[00:10:24.587 --> 00:10:27.787]  that Russia will be at war with that country.
[00:10:32.347 --> 00:10:40.347]   Germany has responded and said that Ukraine's NATO membership will not take place, says the German Chancellor.
[00:10:40.539 --> 00:10:41.140]  That's Schultz.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:46.088]  That's something that Putin was asking for before he launched this invasion.
[00:10:48.766 --> 00:10:51.027]  Biden says arm Ukraine but not Americans.
[00:10:51.047 --> 00:10:54.529]  That's another special report we're going to be getting to.
[00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.232]  We just aired that incredible report that's so important.
[00:10:58.592 --> 00:11:00.873]  Pentagon-funded bioweapons lab in Ukraine.
[00:11:00.913 --> 00:11:02.594]  It is confirmed by U.S.
[00:11:02.614 --> 00:11:04.495]  government documents that they tried to take down.
[00:11:05.196 --> 00:11:06.196]  So that's not fake news.
[00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:08.157]  The Russians did seize those.
[00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:12.860]  Biden corruption invites new world order nukes from hell.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.562]  You just saw that report as well.
[00:11:17.017 --> 00:11:21.747]  After banning Trump for denouncing violence, Twitter lets Putin keep his account.
[00:11:23.951 --> 00:11:25.134]  Elon Musk calls for the U.S.
[00:11:25.154 --> 00:11:27.458]  to increase oil and gas output immediately.
[00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:27.980]  Good for him.
[00:11:30.117 --> 00:11:32.319]  Evacuation, ceasefire breaks down, we're being told.
[00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:38.163]  But we don't know if any of that's true because Zelensky and Ukraine and the mainstream media lie about everything.
[00:11:38.743 --> 00:11:41.565]  And again, I'm not siding with Russia, but I don't side with these liars either.
[00:11:42.305 --> 00:11:46.749]  You can't believe a damn thing they say, like the attack on the reactor and that it was melting down and leaking.
[00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:47.589]  None of that was true.
[00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:52.332]  The ghost of Kiev, the Snake Island.
[00:11:53.353 --> 00:11:54.994]  The list goes on and on.
[00:11:55.014 --> 00:12:05.377]   We're going to be getting To all of that coming up here in a little while and the unprecedented actions that are taking place with censorship in Russia.
[00:12:06.298 --> 00:12:09.980]  That is just very intense and authoritarian.
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:16.923]  Being mirrored by unprecedented authoritarian censorship in Europe and across Canada and the U.S.
[00:12:17.063 --> 00:12:18.524]  Extremely dangerous.
[00:12:19.404 --> 00:12:22.306]  Just nightmare stuff that we're going to be going over here.
[00:12:22.966 --> 00:12:26.248]  Every day that Infowars is still on air is a great blessing.
[00:12:26.872 --> 00:12:37.257]  We are living in the middle of a mega bank takeover, a corporate fascist takeover using Bolshevik tactics of control on the ground.
[00:12:37.877 --> 00:12:40.398]  And again, I'll be getting to all of that and more today.
[00:12:40.439 --> 00:12:45.561]  I'll be getting into what's happening with the energy and all the major commodities exploding in prices.
[00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:52.904]  That was already happening, but now it's going to accelerate with what's happening with these sanctions around the world targeting Russia.
[00:12:52.924 --> 00:12:53.745]  That's right in the middle.
[00:12:54.864 --> 00:13:02.048]  Of so many of the raw materials and energy that keep the world operating, this is a big deal and it's all interconnected.
[00:13:02.088 --> 00:13:22.791]   But speaking of Western NATO-US bioweapon labs all over the Caucasus, and that being mainstream news in hundreds of articles, New York Times, National Geographic, in the years before The Russians pointed this out.
[00:13:22.851 --> 00:13:24.091]  Now they say it doesn't exist.
[00:13:24.192 --> 00:13:28.834]  PolitiFact, USA Today, it's, you know, the moon doesn't exist.
[00:13:29.795 --> 00:13:30.955]  The ocean doesn't exist.
[00:13:33.957 --> 00:13:35.858]  But you can go pull up all the articles about it.
[00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:39.100]  They were bragging about it as they built them in the last decade.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.101]  So that's a big, big deal.
[00:13:42.202 --> 00:13:46.004]  And that ties in to this news.
[00:13:47.545 --> 00:13:50.247]  And somehow I've got to do my best job here.
[00:13:51.297 --> 00:13:56.301]  And really just judiciously in a focused way, cover this and go over all of it right now.
[00:13:57.082 --> 00:14:16.199]   But the bombshell after bombshell after bombshell of what's coming out with the COVID injections and what's coming out about Moderna and Pfizer And it's all just confirmed in plain view.
[00:14:16.719 --> 00:14:17.920]  And no one's getting in trouble.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.101]  And it's way more insane than I even thought.
[00:14:22.042 --> 00:14:27.284]  It's exactly what we knew was going on, but premeditated and totally psychotic.
[00:14:30.846 --> 00:14:32.206]  They're not pissing on our faces.
[00:14:33.027 --> 00:14:37.609]  They're like stabbing us in the face with ice picks and laughing at us while they do it.
[00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:41.030]  And it's because you have a perfect storm.
[00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.511]  I'm going to explain here in a minute.
[00:14:43.624 --> 00:14:54.167]  of bought off corporate media and corrupt government and corrupt intelligence agencies and corrupt judicial system and corrupt Justice Department.
[00:14:55.167 --> 00:14:57.888]  Hell, forget corrupt, just dumb.
[00:14:59.048 --> 00:15:01.749]  Of course, they're corrupt, but just really stupid.
[00:15:02.869 --> 00:15:07.991]  And they don't even have self-preservation instincts.
[00:15:12.762 --> 00:15:14.703]  Like a lot of dictators in the past would have.
[00:15:15.383 --> 00:15:20.025]  They're just a pack of out-of-control crazy people.
[00:15:20.905 --> 00:15:32.429]  Hollywood, the establishment, the mainline churches, the major corporations, I mean, they are on another planet.
[00:15:32.849 --> 00:15:37.751]  And there's this weird mix of scamming lawyers all in the middle of it.
[00:15:39.031 --> 00:15:42.461]   And it's got World War Three written all over it.
[00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:46.324]  It's got end of civilization written all over it.
[00:15:50.627 --> 00:15:52.608]  And I just have a major sense of completion.
[00:15:54.349 --> 00:16:01.895]  Like the world's going to go on hopefully and there's a big awakening happening and that's really great, but of course there's a big awakening happening.
[00:16:02.255 --> 00:16:04.457]  We've been run over by the globalist bus.
[00:16:05.233 --> 00:16:09.576]  And now we look back and 50 more buses are coming, and we're tied down in the middle of the street.
[00:16:09.596 --> 00:16:10.757]  They're going to keep running over us.
[00:16:10.897 --> 00:16:12.578]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[00:16:13.219 --> 00:16:14.039]  And here's the deal.
[00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:19.423]  The people driving the buses are running over their own futures and their own children.
[00:16:23.586 --> 00:16:27.829]  So the prognosis runs from bad to worse.
[00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:34.149]   And I just really can't lie to you, and I'm not going to lie to you, that
[00:16:34.149 --> 00:16:41.909]  this is the nature of consciousness.
[00:16:42.057 --> 00:16:46.662]  And not everybody is going to find God in their time on this planet.
[00:16:46.683 --> 00:16:50.587]  A lot of folks are going to find chaos and oblivion and mindlessness and evil.
[00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:53.290]  And this is all just a big test.
[00:16:54.071 --> 00:17:05.474]   And so we have to understand that in God's infinite wisdom, complete wisdom, That this is simply a test.
[00:17:06.634 --> 00:17:09.134]  And so we have to be very sad for those that fail it.
[00:17:10.135 --> 00:17:16.076]  We have to realize that this planet, everything on it, what we're doing is completely and totally transitory.
[00:17:18.636 --> 00:17:19.977]  And you have to just turn loose of it.
[00:17:22.517 --> 00:17:26.278]  I think listeners and viewers know things aren't going to get very nice in the next decade.
[00:17:27.078 --> 00:17:29.639]  The globalists plan to have 90% of everybody dead by 2030.
[00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:43.337]  And I keep explaining, like, they really mean to do this, and they're really putting things into function that are going to end civilization as we know it.
[00:17:43.377 --> 00:17:55.685]  And when civilization breaks down, go watch a movie like The Road Warrior from the early 1980s, and that's going to be like a vacation spot.
[00:17:56.386 --> 00:17:59.488]  That hellish, dystopic, nightmare future.
[00:17:59.988 --> 00:18:02.190]  In fact, guys, I had this framed over the weekend.
[00:18:02.918 --> 00:18:04.239]  Or Friday, and I forgot to bring it.
[00:18:05.059 --> 00:18:07.601]  It's sitting either on my couch in my office or on my desk.
[00:18:07.661 --> 00:18:09.663]  I had it meant to bring it in here.
[00:18:09.723 --> 00:18:11.204]  My door is open to my office.
[00:18:12.104 --> 00:18:21.531]  Will, one of you great folks, go to my office and get me a diagram that's got a bunch of overlapping points.
[00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:23.252]  It's a meme I saw.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:30.364]  Thursday and I asked my assistant to frame it and it was already on my desk the next day.
[00:18:30.384 --> 00:18:33.707]  So I want to show folks that as well.
[00:18:33.727 --> 00:18:35.909]  Just walk down the hall and to bring that to me.
[00:18:35.929 --> 00:18:36.429]  That'd be great.
[00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:37.330]  Thank you very much.
[00:18:38.391 --> 00:18:39.732]  And I think this says it all.
[00:18:39.812 --> 00:18:43.635]  So what I'm doing here is I'm going to show you this diagram.
[00:18:45.016 --> 00:18:48.419]  And then I'm going to be a good boy and stop.
[00:18:51.501 --> 00:18:52.042]  Holding back.
[00:18:54.622 --> 00:18:57.203]  And go ahead and just lay it out.
[00:18:59.243 --> 00:19:02.343]  And you know, when I lay all this out, a lot of people think, hey, that's great news.
[00:19:03.344 --> 00:19:04.784]  It's coming out that they did this.
[00:19:07.124 --> 00:19:30.148]   But then when you read the SPARS 2025-2028 document put out by the Rockefeller and John Hopkins and Bill and Melinda Gates group, they talk about how when they hit us with the bioweapon, How they're going to get caught in the process and how that's meant to trigger the loss of confidence of the government and the system and collapse civilization.
[00:19:32.329 --> 00:19:39.272]  But in the process... I'll go get it, it's alright.
[00:19:39.531 --> 00:19:51.971]   In the process, they transfer all the wealth and power to themselves while they toy with us like a cat with a mouse
[00:19:51.971 --> 00:19:55.531]  for a while before they break our neck and eat us.
[00:19:55.983 --> 00:20:00.864]  So here's a meme I saw for TV viewers.
[00:20:01.705 --> 00:20:03.085]  I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[00:20:04.626 --> 00:20:09.828]  But it's a bunch of overlapping circles, diagram, and in the middle it says, you are here.
[00:20:11.589 --> 00:20:16.306]   And then there's a bunch of dystopic films and books And TV shows.
[00:20:17.187 --> 00:20:24.309]  You've got The Hunger Games at the bottom and 1984 at the top and Brave New World over on the left and Idiocracy on the right.
[00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:27.130]  And They Lives up in the corner.
[00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:28.931]  And you got Fahrenheit 451.
[00:20:29.351 --> 00:20:30.432]  You got Animal Farm.
[00:20:30.452 --> 00:20:31.452]  You got Mad Max.
[00:20:34.053 --> 00:20:35.233]  You got Soylent Green.
[00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:36.674]  You got The Matrix.
[00:20:38.415 --> 00:20:39.475]  And really, you are here.
[00:20:40.899 --> 00:20:49.483]  Because all of these were just artists and futurists and people projecting forward of what they thought the world would look like if things weren't turned around.
[00:20:49.824 --> 00:21:05.852]  And George Orwell in 1948 thought that by 1984, if Stalin was able to take over the Western world, he figured it'd be like this book, because he worked with Stalin and others.
[00:21:07.625 --> 00:21:10.526]  The Ney Lives, an early 1960s science fiction book.
[00:21:10.966 --> 00:21:12.647]  It's excellent about nature of reality.
[00:21:13.408 --> 00:21:16.249]  Fahrenheit 451, dealing with book burning.
[00:21:17.089 --> 00:21:18.330]  Animal farms are well again.
[00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:25.013]  Magmax is a dystopia set out in Australia after civilization breaks down and the oil runs out.
[00:21:26.253 --> 00:21:29.655]  Sonic greens when the oceans and soils die, so humans are eating humans.
[00:21:29.835 --> 00:21:37.480]   Idiocracies, the dumbing down and the lowering of the IQ, and the great Mike Judge.
[00:21:37.941 --> 00:21:41.924]  He got Brave New World written in 31 about the medical tyranny, genetic engineering takeover.
[00:21:41.944 --> 00:21:52.512]  And of course, Hunger Games is very accurate actually on what the globalists want to set up, where everybody's poor except for a few city-state regions that own and control the planet.
[00:21:53.153 --> 00:22:02.681]  The general public's kept in a low-tech feudalist system, but everybody else in the establishment, which is a very small percent, live in a super high-tech area.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.982]  Humans are really good at envisioning where things are going.
[00:22:08.022 --> 00:22:15.008]  And a lot of people who wrote these books, in fact all of them, said this is kind of where they think the world's going.
[00:22:15.268 --> 00:22:19.071]  These were social commentary about what the world would be like in the year 2022.
[00:22:19.211 --> 00:22:21.793]  You know what movie's set in 2022?
[00:22:21.853 --> 00:22:22.374]  Guess which one?
[00:22:22.273 --> 00:22:39.393]   set in 2022? Guess which one? Silent Green. Silent Green set in 2022.
[00:22:38.995 --> 00:22:52.226]  And you see, Soylent Green didn't kick off the collapse of the ecosystem, the collapse of civilization, but the globalists are doing it artificially with the lockdowns, artificially with all of these supply chain annihilations that they've been involved in.
[00:22:52.306 --> 00:22:56.009]  So this diagram right here says it all.
[00:22:56.109 --> 00:22:56.950]  And we are here.
[00:22:58.231 --> 00:22:59.612]  We are right here with our children.
[00:23:02.354 --> 00:23:09.409]   And I saw in the tweet that I found this in, It said, we're all living in the Alex Jones timeline.
[00:23:10.009 --> 00:23:11.550]  And it was this link.
[00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:14.492]  And no, you're not living in the Alex Jones timeline.
[00:23:14.592 --> 00:23:17.354]  You're living in the New World Order timeline.
[00:23:18.168 --> 00:23:20.688]  You're living in the selfishness timeline, just like I am.
[00:23:20.989 --> 00:23:22.649]  You're living in the dumbed-down timeline.
[00:23:23.709 --> 00:23:51.850]   We're an incredible species that could envision, if things kept getting worse, where it would lead, and you mix all these things together, and we've got horrible aspects of every piece of this there, except there's so much good at the same time, but conscious, bad corporations who want to artificially be the alpha predators they believe, But when you don't have wolves anymore, you need more human hunting to keep the numbers of deer down.
[00:23:52.231 --> 00:24:03.414]  That's their argument that they're artificially bringing dystopia in because we live in an unnatural, decadent society and a bunch of useless eaters are going around who need to be wiped out.
[00:24:03.774 --> 00:24:15.938]  And at a certain level, if the public doesn't wake up and say no to this, it doesn't innovate, and doesn't create a clear vision for ourselves, we kind of deserve what we're having done to us, don't we?
[00:24:17.412 --> 00:24:19.815]  Except they're targeting children.
[00:24:21.938 --> 00:24:24.698]   And they are trying to get children to give up their humanity
[00:24:24.698 --> 00:24:29.978]   and give up their free will and basically become sterilized, which is the same thing as killing them
[00:24:29.978 --> 00:24:36.377]   under the transgender mode, and imprison them and take all their hopes and dreams away
[00:24:36.377 --> 00:24:40.297]   and lock them in these digital metaverse prisons that Zuckerberg just said.
[00:24:40.297 --> 00:24:46.457]   He believes that within 15 years, the majority of people will live in the metaverse.
[00:24:46.457 --> 00:24:48.998]  Well, 'cause you're gonna be locked in your house.
[00:24:48.998 --> 00:24:55.218]   And if you don't submit and only watch the television or only watch the iPad or put the new Google
[00:24:55.218 --> 00:25:02.617]   or Apple contacts in, if you don't spend 15 hours a day plugged into their system,
[00:25:02.617 --> 00:25:05.138]  you're not gonna get the social credit score.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:08.921]  You're not going to get the food delivery from the food delivery robot.
[00:25:10.122 --> 00:25:11.782]  Because they don't want to just kill you.
[00:25:11.842 --> 00:25:23.207]  They want to enslave you and brainwash you and dumb you down and make you unnatural before they incinerate you and spew your ashes into the atmosphere.
[00:25:24.868 --> 00:25:27.917]   You are Here.
[00:25:27.937 --> 00:25:33.300]  I want to find out who made this and put on a poster of it or a t-shirt.
[00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:36.561]  Or we can make our own.
[00:25:40.283 --> 00:25:41.744]  But there you are.
[00:25:42.644 --> 00:25:47.987]  We have to shoot for a utopia which we'll never attain so that we don't go into the dystopia.
[00:25:49.926 --> 00:25:54.886]   We have to dream and have a renaissance and innovate and be strong and love each other
[00:25:54.886 --> 00:26:02.046]   and reject the globalist systems and stand up for what's right or we're all destroyed.
[00:26:02.046 --> 00:26:06.805]   And that means you're going to get punished for telling the truth sometimes.
[00:26:06.805 --> 00:26:08.046]  You're going to be attacked for it.
[00:26:08.046 --> 00:26:13.526]   You're going to lose some money or you're going to get persecuted.
[00:26:13.806 --> 00:26:25.532]  But don't you understand that everybody's going over the edge of a cliff and the only way we stop that is for those of us that see what's happening to stand up and say no and take action.
[00:26:25.772 --> 00:26:27.152]  And there's so many ways to do it.
[00:26:27.392 --> 00:26:32.895]  But the first thing you got to do is recognize the globalists have given up on themselves.
[00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:34.596]  They've given up on you.
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:45.044]  They've given up on humanity and they believe they're looking forward to the end of humanity and their ascension by merging with machines.
[00:26:45.745 --> 00:26:48.106]  And they believe that they are about to become gods.
[00:26:48.766 --> 00:27:05.894]   But in the process they must exercise godlike power upon the human mass and bring forth the battle of the gods or the Guter Dammerung out of which There'll be the rise of the Superman.
[00:27:08.694 --> 00:27:11.435]  And that's the philosophy that they follow.
[00:27:11.475 --> 00:27:13.815]  That's the philosophy that they're involved in.
[00:27:16.236 --> 00:27:28.779]  And as things get worse and as things break down and as chivalry and love dissipate, a lot of people that have been good and strong so far are gonna join with evil to protect their families.
[00:27:29.952 --> 00:27:33.995]  And then when that happens, things accelerate very quickly.
[00:27:37.938 --> 00:27:45.664]  And the authoritarian movement that destroys the foundation of freedom is then destroyed itself.
[00:27:47.786 --> 00:27:59.235]  And the good people that in the last moment sign on to Satan then are wedded to the very top of the globalist organism and carry out the final extermination.
[00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:01.139]  of the general public.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:04.800]  This is all a ritual.
[00:28:07.941 --> 00:28:24.447]  It's all a system to create something so hellish that they can get the very best people to turn against God and turn against humanity to protect their physical bodies and the physical bodies of their children.
[00:28:25.927 --> 00:28:31.549]   And thus, in the process, give up their golden ticket to infinity.
[00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:37.550]  All right, let me do this.
[00:28:37.635 --> 00:28:39.375]  Let me go ahead and get into the big news and.
[00:28:42.477 --> 00:28:44.378]  When we hit this, I'm trying to move as quick as I can.
[00:28:44.418 --> 00:28:46.879]  As there's obviously a lot to get to, and I really need to get to all this.
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.461]  And I'm just begging listeners to realize what a big deal.
[00:28:54.122 --> 00:28:54.842]  All of this is.
[00:28:57.524 --> 00:28:58.364]  And the fact that.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:18.804]  This information comes out and then it's like blowing on a dandelion and the little, little parachutes, little spores, little seeds go out and they disappear as the wind catches them.
[00:29:19.204 --> 00:29:42.675]   You don't know where they land or if they ever sprout or where that information goes, but nevertheless, This information needs to find fertile ground, and it needs to bear fruit, and it needs to bear fruit, and it needs to bear fruit, and again, create that chain reaction that we're really, really looking for here.
[00:29:42.674 --> 00:29:49.075]   So let me go ahead and hit the COVID news, and then we'll get into the war news and
[00:29:49.075 --> 00:29:52.914]   the economy news and the energy news and how it all ties together.
[00:29:52.914 --> 00:30:05.075]   Again, I want to thank you all for joining me here on this live Saturday broadcast,
[00:30:05.075 --> 00:30:07.315]  this emergency broadcast.
[00:30:07.315 --> 00:30:17.315]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:30:09.277 --> 00:30:27.790]  And I'm going to do my best here to talk about just the incredible events that have taken place concerning the Great Reset Medical Combine's rollout in the last 26 months of Disease X.
[00:30:29.298 --> 00:30:41.925]  War Game model launched by John Hopkins University, the Rockefeller Foundation, in conjunction with other allied foundations and the United Nations, as well as the Department of Defense and NATO.
[00:30:44.926 --> 00:31:04.244]   The project is a real chimeric synthetic virus created in different labs around the world and combined and then released They say in China, but we know already sequenced and created by Moderna and others in labs as early as 2016.
[00:31:04.465 --> 00:31:05.645]  That's all public.
[00:31:07.727 --> 00:31:19.174]  We now know from major prestigious studies that it doesn't just attack the entire cardiovascular system, the heart, the lungs, the arteries, the veins, the capillaries, cause myocarditis, heart attacks, and blood clots.
[00:31:19.194 --> 00:31:22.356]  It doesn't just attack the brain, causing strokes and embolisms.
[00:31:22.937 --> 00:31:28.576]   It doesn't just attack the ovaries and testicles. It doesn't just attack the lungs.
[00:31:28.576 --> 00:31:33.576]   It doesn't just attack all the major organs and tissues of the body, but it actually goes in and
[00:31:33.576 --> 00:31:41.667]   causes a chain reaction in the liver and begins replicating and taking over the DNA structure of
[00:31:41.667 --> 00:31:46.257]   one of the most magical parts of our magical bodies, the liver.
[00:31:46.444 --> 00:31:57.570]  Just like we always knew they could never get mRNA gene therapies approved because they would generally work really well except a small percentage of people, but still quite substantive, would have their livers liquefied.
[00:32:01.058 --> 00:32:06.562]  And that's what's happened to a lot of folks around the world that took the Pfizer or Moderna shots.
[00:32:06.582 --> 00:32:11.365]  You've seen the newscasts where totally healthy mother, 30-something years old, doesn't even drink.
[00:32:11.846 --> 00:32:14.027]  Takes the shot, week later, total organ failure.
[00:32:14.347 --> 00:32:17.169]  The doctor's on the news and it's just her liver liquefied.
[00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:18.570]  Liquefied.
[00:32:20.432 --> 00:32:23.834]  Takes over every freaking cell, destroys every cell in the liver.
[00:32:24.975 --> 00:32:27.657]  There's a lot of famous cases and studies out there, and I got some here.
[00:32:28.496 --> 00:32:36.901]  Where they'll give a hundred patients in one test this mRNA shot that's supposedly going to cure a disease.
[00:32:37.221 --> 00:32:39.182]  And it did cure the disease in some people.
[00:32:39.582 --> 00:32:40.563]  Others didn't do anything.
[00:32:41.263 --> 00:32:47.046]  And out of the hundred, two of the kids, it was a test on kids, had their livers liquefy and they died.
[00:32:48.127 --> 00:32:51.649]  So, I mean, and I've got all the documents here.
[00:32:53.462 --> 00:32:55.663]  Well, I say all the documents, just some of the documents, there's so many.
[00:32:56.263 --> 00:33:06.946]  From Mainstream News in 2018-19, going, oh, Moderna was set up to get mRNA on the market, but it can't, and Bill Gates invested in it because it keeps killing people in the trials.
[00:33:09.187 --> 00:33:20.931]  And that's why you saw Fauci and the rest of them on TV in 2019 saying, we need to blow up the old system to get mRNA in, we need a virus, something like a bird flu out of China.
[00:33:22.282 --> 00:33:30.730]  To be so scary that it breaks the system and we just get authorization, emergency use, and we stop having a five, 10-year approval process.
[00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:38.737]  And they're all up there laughing and smiling at each other, talking about what they're doing to us and everybody else in our faces.
[00:33:42.881 --> 00:33:44.042]  Yeah, the crew's still on the spot.
[00:33:44.082 --> 00:33:46.404]  They just pulled up the video while I was talking about it.
[00:33:47.611 --> 00:33:48.712]  So they think you're dumb.
[00:33:48.972 --> 00:33:51.314]  So they talk like you're the little kids at the little kid table.
[00:33:51.574 --> 00:34:00.522]  You ever had Thanksgiving or Christmas and family comes over as a bunch of kids and they open up card tables and the kids are all at the card tables until you're about 12 or 13 or whatever.
[00:34:00.942 --> 00:34:04.065]  And you're like 11, you're like, listen, I don't want to be at the kid table.
[00:34:05.066 --> 00:34:06.027]  Can I go eat in my room?
[00:34:06.747 --> 00:34:08.629]  But we're all over here at the kid table.
[00:34:09.025 --> 00:34:16.331]  Well, they're talking about how they're going to kill everybody, but how they're first going to test a bunch of stuff on us to get cures to everything for themselves.
[00:34:16.731 --> 00:34:21.314]  And they're talking about us like we're five-year-olds and don't understand what they're saying.
[00:34:24.377 --> 00:34:25.257]  And that's how this works.
[00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:28.180]  It's naivete.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.541]  Let me tell you a story, then I'll get into this.
[00:34:32.603 --> 00:34:38.668]  One of my uncle's daughters, Sweet Verna, was living with us.
[00:34:40.575 --> 00:34:47.357]  for a couple years when my uncle was down in Central America and on business.
[00:34:48.758 --> 00:34:52.679]  And she was about six years old or so.
[00:34:54.939 --> 00:35:00.441]  And I was about nine, maybe 10, I don't remember.
[00:35:01.602 --> 00:35:04.782]  And we're sitting there eating T-bone steaks my mom had grilled.
[00:35:06.283 --> 00:35:09.404]  And man, she's going, man, this beef, this cow's really good.
[00:35:11.141 --> 00:35:13.843]  She says, do they take them and do they do a surgery on them to get it?
[00:35:15.504 --> 00:35:17.085]  And I started laughing so hard.
[00:35:18.245 --> 00:35:20.947]  And I said, yeah, Verna, they do a surgery, all right.
[00:35:22.308 --> 00:35:24.449]  Because I've seen a cow slaughtered before.
[00:35:24.469 --> 00:35:26.971]  You know, my family has a ranch.
[00:35:26.991 --> 00:35:34.435]  And back in the day, they would still butcher a cow or two a year themselves and save the butcher's bill down the barn.
[00:35:35.476 --> 00:35:36.777]  And I laughed so hard.
[00:35:36.837 --> 00:35:37.917]  I said, oh, yeah, Verna.
[00:35:39.578 --> 00:35:40.659]  They do a surgery, all right.
[00:35:41.835 --> 00:35:47.780]  And the American people are like little Verna, five-year-old girl, maybe five, six.
[00:35:49.821 --> 00:35:52.083]  And she's sitting there eating that beef and it tastes so good.
[00:35:52.103 --> 00:35:53.424]  She goes, this is cow beef.
[00:35:53.564 --> 00:35:54.085]  I like that.
[00:35:54.105 --> 00:35:54.685]  It's tasty.
[00:35:55.005 --> 00:35:55.766]  I want more of that.
[00:35:56.306 --> 00:36:02.031]  So do they take the cow to the hospital and do they do a surgery to get the meat?
[00:36:02.051 --> 00:36:02.872]  That was the full quote.
[00:36:03.892 --> 00:36:06.394]  And that right there really is everything.
[00:36:06.735 --> 00:36:07.515]  She's not stupid.
[00:36:07.535 --> 00:36:08.256]  She's really smart.
[00:36:08.296 --> 00:36:10.658]  Works for big tech companies today and is very successful.
[00:36:11.465 --> 00:36:13.146]  But she was a little girl.
[00:36:13.186 --> 00:36:13.787]  She was innocent.
[00:36:15.948 --> 00:36:21.512]  And she never thought about where meat came from, whether an animal was slaughtered for it.
[00:36:22.833 --> 00:36:25.515]  She thought, went down, surely cows are sweet.
[00:36:25.835 --> 00:36:26.555]  See them in a field.
[00:36:28.157 --> 00:36:30.098]  You see them on the sides of milk cartons.
[00:36:31.159 --> 00:36:32.079]  See them on billboards.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:33.901]  See them in cartoons.
[00:36:36.642 --> 00:36:40.205]  See them in Chick-fil-A commercials now saying, please don't eat beef, eat chicken.
[00:36:43.752 --> 00:36:44.752]  And she didn't understand that.
[00:36:45.473 --> 00:36:48.174]  And see, we're not five years old though.
[00:36:49.574 --> 00:36:58.498]  And so when I get up here and I say, they couldn't get mRNA approved and it killed a large portion of people in all the tests they did.
[00:37:00.278 --> 00:37:01.139]  That was the short term.
[00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:09.102]  And then they rolled out one that they tested and they knew was bad for you and would cause all sorts of health problems.
[00:37:09.322 --> 00:37:11.943]  We have the CDC documents from October of 2020 on that.
[00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:21.647]  And we had all the top scientists, when I say all, like almost all the top scientists in the world were like former heads of companies, you name it, were going, excuse me?
[00:37:21.667 --> 00:37:29.029]  The spike protein is highly poisonous and we scanned it and it's an HIV delivery system patented by Fauci and Bill Gates.
[00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:31.710]  And that's now all out in the news, totally confirmed as well.
[00:37:32.810 --> 00:37:40.917]  The CEOs of Moderna and Pfizer go on TV and go, oh yeah, we make viruses in labs, we make COVID-19, no big deal.
[00:37:41.157 --> 00:37:44.560]  Yeah, we made the spike protein, and yeah, we have a patent on it.
[00:37:46.661 --> 00:37:50.545]  Yeah, it's one in three trillion that it can actually occur, but that's ours.
[00:37:53.387 --> 00:37:54.368]  It could be an accident.
[00:37:55.949 --> 00:38:04.424]   They got together, they did this on purpose, and they even had a plan when it came out later To act like they didn't know why it happened.
[00:38:04.444 --> 00:38:06.446]  That's why they had to have the CDC come out Friday.
[00:38:07.687 --> 00:38:08.608]  I got the clip coming up.
[00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:16.915]  And she said, oh, we were wishful thinking.
[00:38:17.316 --> 00:38:18.837]  The vaccine doesn't work.
[00:38:18.877 --> 00:38:19.738]  We're sorry.
[00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:21.340]  That's all in the spars.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:21.340]  2025, 2028.
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.482]  And when you follow it, it's a war game.
[00:38:26.513 --> 00:38:31.197]  Well, a war game of attacking Russia or Russia attacking us is a simulation of what you really do.
[00:38:31.477 --> 00:38:34.921]  So they all had their SPARS 2025-2028 document.
[00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:39.725]  And if you follow it through the years, it's exactly to the day what they actually do.
[00:38:40.005 --> 00:38:48.613]  And the exact tweets written years before they released COVID, the exact tweets they would later release, even the same word, if you move it around, becomes COVID.
[00:38:50.134 --> 00:38:56.213]   You can go see our Spars 2025-2028 reports at Bandot Video.
[00:38:56.233 --> 00:38:59.776]  Just go to Bandot Video and search Spars 2025-2028.
[00:39:00.336 --> 00:39:02.858]  You'll see multi-hour reports, short reports, you name it.
[00:39:03.158 --> 00:39:06.661]  You can see us showing all the documents or just go read it for yourself.
[00:39:06.921 --> 00:39:13.186]  Hell, it's on John Hopkins, Rockefeller Foundation, Department of Defense websites.
[00:39:13.206 --> 00:39:14.047]  They're real proud of it.
[00:39:14.387 --> 00:39:15.748]  And you can know what's coming next.
[00:39:15.889 --> 00:39:16.269]  Okay.
[00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:26.246]   And oh, it says by next year, By the end of winter, they'll admit it didn't work and apologize and say it was all a big mistake, and then they'll fire a bunch of the executives.
[00:39:26.507 --> 00:39:27.248]  Let's turn the page.
[00:39:27.368 --> 00:39:28.429]  Oh, and then they really do that.
[00:39:29.530 --> 00:39:31.032]  And they go, how does Alex Jones know this?
[00:39:31.353 --> 00:39:32.654]  He's got to be in with them.
[00:39:33.095 --> 00:39:33.856]  He's got to know.
[00:39:34.176 --> 00:39:35.958]  Yeah, Fauci went on TV.
[00:39:37.179 --> 00:39:40.141]  In early 2017, he said, we don't care about Trump.
[00:39:40.161 --> 00:39:40.841]  We're in control.
[00:39:41.242 --> 00:39:44.724]  He will be faced with a new deadly virus and a pandemic.
[00:39:45.284 --> 00:39:47.305]  And the whole crowd is like getting really excited.
[00:39:47.625 --> 00:39:51.888]  He's up there looking like a supervillain, except it's not some movie like Marvel Comics.
[00:39:52.268 --> 00:39:56.070]  It's a real supervillain with his eyes gleaming with murder.
[00:39:58.532 --> 00:39:59.653]  There it is, emergency.
[00:40:01.334 --> 00:40:06.814]   Saturday broadcast world shocked by spars 2025 2028 document
[00:40:06.814 --> 00:40:14.494]   Three million 590 plus thousand views
[00:40:15.484 --> 00:40:17.584]  It needs 100 million views.
[00:40:19.725 --> 00:40:20.545]  Will I be killed?
[00:40:20.605 --> 00:40:21.606]  Will I be shut down?
[00:40:21.646 --> 00:40:22.506]  Will I be imprisoned?
[00:40:24.446 --> 00:40:24.987]  Will you be?
[00:40:25.007 --> 00:40:29.828]  Because you're not going to sit there and stick your head between your legs and get out of this.
[00:40:31.127 --> 00:40:39.709]  I don't care who you are, where you work, how much money you've got, there's no reason for anybody to put the world into this artificial collapse.
[00:40:40.329 --> 00:40:46.331]  Unless, are there aliens or something, I don't know about, that have laser guns to the heads of Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates?
[00:40:46.371 --> 00:40:47.311]  We know that's not what it is.
[00:40:48.971 --> 00:40:59.874]  Prince Charles and his dad, his dad going back 80 years, when he was a young man, gave newspaper interviews about how he wanted to exterminate the majority of the world.
[00:41:01.618 --> 00:41:10.900]  Like, you might like to jog, or hike, or fly a kite, or marksmanship, or basketball, or painting.
[00:41:11.981 --> 00:41:16.862]  These royals like to look at you as animals and talk about culling you and killing you.
[00:41:19.763 --> 00:41:23.604]  And they write books about it, and they go to conferences about it, and they talk about it.
[00:41:26.127 --> 00:41:27.228]  Tell you they're going to kill you.
[00:41:27.988 --> 00:41:30.329]  And now Prince Charles says the Great Reset is here.
[00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:34.432]  We're launching a war, bigger than any war ever, against humans hurting the planet.
[00:41:34.452 --> 00:41:39.274]  And we need more money than all the money exists in the world to stop this scourge.
[00:41:39.495 --> 00:41:40.595]  And he's talking about us.
[00:41:41.896 --> 00:41:42.596]  You know the good news?
[00:41:43.257 --> 00:41:52.729]   When he climbed on that podium four months ago, he fell and tripped on his ugly face and slammed his face
[00:41:52.729 --> 00:41:59.798]   into the ground when he's running up there in his little blue suit and he hits the top running
[00:41:59.798 --> 00:42:08.279]   up there to make his announcement declaration of war and fell flat on his Transylvanian nose.
[00:42:08.279 --> 00:42:12.879]  Look it up.
[00:42:15.758 --> 00:42:16.479]  So.
[00:42:16.479 --> 00:42:26.479]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:42:19.907 --> 00:42:27.692]  The speech was at the Big Carbon Conference in Europe, where they had to have generators that ran everything off diesel.
[00:42:28.313 --> 00:42:31.355]  And then they tried to cover up the diesel engines because, you know, diesel's evil.
[00:42:32.175 --> 00:42:37.839]  And it'll be something like, Prince Charles says we need a military campaign to stop climate change is the headlines.
[00:42:37.859 --> 00:42:40.301]  And you can find the video there where he falls on his face.
[00:42:41.822 --> 00:42:58.897]   I mean, when you talk about self-appointed, when you talk about arrogant, when you talk about hateful, When you talk about evil, when you talk about wanting to get rid of you and your family, he's declared that he's a serial killer and he's a destroyer of worlds if he has his way.
[00:43:00.358 --> 00:43:17.438]   He is the direct line to Vlad the Impaler, the direct mainstay descendant on earth, the number one relative, half the blood in his veins directly from Vlad the Impaler.
[00:43:20.701 --> 00:43:24.823]  And his family's where you get Count Dracula from, and he wants you dead.
[00:43:24.843 --> 00:43:25.404]  Gee!
[00:43:27.585 --> 00:43:28.466]  Now you get it, folks.
[00:43:28.946 --> 00:43:30.787]  His family's been known for a long time.
[00:43:31.668 --> 00:43:35.991]  So much that great literary minds had to enshrine them in fiction books.
[00:43:36.771 --> 00:43:38.813]  No, he doesn't turn into a bat and fly around at night.
[00:43:39.573 --> 00:43:44.777]  But the spirit that's in these people has been a curse on humanity for over a thousand years.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.441]  All right, let's continue.
[00:43:49.681 --> 00:43:54.184]  I said I'm going to take my time and go through all this, but I also need to hurry in some areas and get to more of it, so let's just start here.
[00:43:55.886 --> 00:43:57.527]  It's all come out, it isn't a vaccine.
[00:43:57.787 --> 00:43:58.988]  It's all come out, it doesn't help you.
[00:43:59.288 --> 00:44:03.390]  It's all come out, it attacks your body, attacks your double helix, and now what has come out?
[00:44:03.731 --> 00:44:05.132]  This is the big new news.
[00:44:08.053 --> 00:44:14.418]  The great researchers, thank God they're now fully awake and aren't naive anymore, at the blaze did something smart.
[00:44:14.738 --> 00:44:27.734]   They put in a FOIA request Concerning federal government spending on propaganda pushing the COVID narrative and the anti-Avramectin narrative and the pro-vaccine narrative that isn't a vaccine.
[00:44:29.156 --> 00:44:30.538]  You can go read the documents for yourself.
[00:44:30.658 --> 00:44:31.859]  I spent an hour today reading them.
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.702]  And the government admits they're real.
[00:44:35.445 --> 00:44:48.853]  One billion dollars was spent in the first year of Biden being in office secretly to buy off thousands of mainstream media outlets, TV stations, networks, newspapers, local TV.
[00:44:50.134 --> 00:44:51.575]  There's just one program we know of.
[00:44:52.315 --> 00:44:53.936]  One billion dollars.
[00:44:54.016 --> 00:44:59.760]  And they had to sign an agreement that they would have no anti-vaccine coverage.
[00:45:01.704 --> 00:45:34.895]   Total fraud, not just journalistic malpractice, not just malfeasance, not just fake news, but criminally taking money to then not let any of your reporters in on the fact that they can't go talk to the guy whose son dies from a heart attack, they can't talk to the doctor, and then what do you do once you bought up the media but still, oh, you know, the young Scholarship athlete takes the Pfizer shot, has a heart attack.
[00:45:35.296 --> 00:45:36.957]  His doctor says it caused a heart attack.
[00:45:37.858 --> 00:45:38.919]  Local news picks it up.
[00:45:38.939 --> 00:45:41.100]  I guess they didn't get the paid off or whatever.
[00:45:41.601 --> 00:45:51.849]  And then Yahoo News quotes the UN saying, well, you're not allowed to have that video on the internet because it makes people be vaccine hesitant.
[00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:56.053]  We're not saying you're lying, but you're just not allowed to talk about it.
[00:45:56.313 --> 00:45:58.355]  So big tech, big dinosaur media.
[00:45:59.102 --> 00:46:03.045]  being paid not just that billion dollars but billions and billions we know of in the U.S.
[00:46:03.105 --> 00:46:15.253]  alone to buy quote influencers, NFL, NBA, major baseball players, all of them down to low-level YouTubers that went public.
[00:46:15.293 --> 00:46:22.338]  A lot of them saying they were offered thousands of dollars every time they came out and said, I got the vaccine, it worked great and I loved it.
[00:46:26.417 --> 00:46:27.318]  So it's a big story.
[00:46:27.358 --> 00:46:34.122]  It's posted up on InfoWars.com by the actual reporter that was at Newsmax when she saw this happen.
[00:46:34.743 --> 00:46:37.885]  And then she really augments and adds a lot to the Blaze article.
[00:46:39.205 --> 00:46:40.206]  And she's on the show Monday.
[00:46:41.447 --> 00:46:42.087]  Exclusive!
[00:46:42.147 --> 00:46:51.073]  The federal government paid hundreds of media companies to advertise the COVID-19 vaccines while those same outlets provided positive coverage on the vaccines.
[00:46:51.373 --> 00:46:53.375]  But it gets even worse than what the Blaze is saying.
[00:46:53.915 --> 00:46:59.606]   When you read the documents, that are linked in the report, which I'll show you.
[00:47:01.807 --> 00:47:02.607]  It's unbelievable.
[00:47:03.088 --> 00:47:06.790]  You're not allowed to have anybody talk bad about it once you're on the team.
[00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.671]  It's called, we can do this.
[00:47:09.411 --> 00:47:10.672]  Yes, you can be evil.
[00:47:12.613 --> 00:47:16.195]  And that's why nobody was allowed to speak up, because they were being paid.
[00:47:17.896 --> 00:47:23.879]  And then when you would try as a citizen to speak up, oh, well, you were bad, you were evil, you had to be silenced.
[00:47:23.899 --> 00:47:24.300]  Here's another one.
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:32.193]   Fox News and Newsmax Took Biden money, and that's the big takeaway by Emerald Robinson, who's on the show Monday.
[00:47:32.874 --> 00:47:38.639]  Fox News and Newsmax took Biden's money to push deadly COVID vaccines to its viewers.
[00:47:38.679 --> 00:47:43.923]  So you wonder why a couple of their reporters would just say, yeah, I know somebody got really sick from it.
[00:47:44.003 --> 00:47:44.723]  I'm not taking it.
[00:47:44.864 --> 00:47:45.264]  Fired!
[00:47:48.888 --> 00:47:52.350]  And why would Chris Ruddy, who I'm not even trying to attack, but I mean, he did this.
[00:47:52.410 --> 00:47:53.250]  It's got to be exposed.
[00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:59.294]  Why would he write articles like, Newsmax CEO, Biden should be applauded for the vaccine efforts.
[00:47:59.714 --> 00:48:00.595]  You know how much money?
[00:48:02.676 --> 00:48:06.098]  Well, the feds say it's secret how much they paid Newsmax, but they did.
[00:48:07.078 --> 00:48:08.039]  And of course, Fox News.
[00:48:09.605 --> 00:48:12.506]  That's why they would always say, I'm not saying you shouldn't take the vaccine.
[00:48:12.926 --> 00:48:14.167]  Everybody should get their vaccine.
[00:48:14.627 --> 00:48:22.030]  All we're saying is you shouldn't be made to do it because they were told on ABC, NBC, you name it, Fox, don't criticize it in any way.
[00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:26.092]  If you have to say everybody should take it, but we have a question.
[00:48:27.252 --> 00:48:28.253]  And then that was the segue.
[00:48:30.194 --> 00:48:51.197]   Did anybody at Fox News or Newsmax or CNN tell you Did they tell you that they were being paid by the federal government with your taxpayer money and signed an agreement not to do any criticism or talk to anybody that was critical?
[00:48:53.097 --> 00:48:53.277]  No.
[00:48:54.237 --> 00:48:55.498]  You didn't get that memo, did you?
[00:48:58.258 --> 00:49:08.801]  And in full disclosure, I'm talking to lawyers right now because people can't do things in mediation that, in my view, is unethical or illegal.
[00:49:09.542 --> 00:49:11.643]  And then expect that we're not ever going to talk about it.
[00:49:12.384 --> 00:49:13.385]  But I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:49:14.045 --> 00:49:20.909]  But you can imagine what the Democrats have done approaching us with the threats if we don't get on board with them.
[00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:29.635]  And they even do it in the vehicle of lawsuits, which made me like, OK, I'm never settling and I'm going to go all the way with you people.
[00:49:29.895 --> 00:49:31.876]  Because here's the deal, folks.
[00:49:32.177 --> 00:49:34.138]  There's no bottom to these people.
[00:49:36.792 --> 00:49:49.801]  And they're so confident in their takeover, they'll sit there face-to-face and say, get on board with us, and not only will this be taken care of, but you'll be taken care of.
[00:49:50.361 --> 00:50:08.826]   And you know, this isn't the only time this has happened, because I like to be able to have these meetings, and as long as something somebody isn't doing is criminal, I'm not going to talk about it on air because I need to be able to, you know, meet with people and over the years of all different types and not put out what they've said.
[00:50:08.866 --> 00:50:14.530]  But it's just insane.
[00:50:16.491 --> 00:50:20.293]  So they come to people and they say, do you want money or do you want to be fired?
[00:50:21.094 --> 00:50:22.675]  Do you want money or do you want to be sued?
[00:50:24.275 --> 00:50:38.726]  But what good is all the money when you're giving hundreds of millions and billions of people a shot that double cuts their DNA, and gives them cancer, and gives them blood clots, and they want to give it to little kids, and they are?
[00:50:39.887 --> 00:50:52.196]  And finally the FDA, and finally the CDC's own scientist, after the European scientist in the government refused six months ago, finally two months ago they went, okay, don't give it to under fives, stop it, stop it now.
[00:50:52.216 --> 00:50:56.676]   Because they all know They got money, but you're killing kids!
[00:50:58.436 --> 00:51:05.859]  You are literally giving people stuff that's gonna grow prion crystals in their bodies until they die.
[00:51:06.399 --> 00:51:11.101]  And then it causes hundreds and hundreds of different disorders and cancers and problems.
[00:51:11.121 --> 00:51:12.301]  I mean, thousands total.
[00:51:12.842 --> 00:51:13.842]  I mean, it just fries you.
[00:51:14.382 --> 00:51:22.305]  And then everybody wonders why the life expectancy drops, why fertility drops, why the sperm's down 90 plus percent, why we're falling apart, why we're so unhealthy.
[00:51:24.227 --> 00:51:25.708]  And now they're gonna do this to us.
[00:51:26.548 --> 00:51:29.849]  And remember Ivory Hecker here in Texas?
[00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:40.354]  And she would just try to show the local CDC document, or she would try to interview somebody that got really sick, or talk to a doctor that took it and got sick.
[00:51:40.654 --> 00:51:43.895]  And they said, no, you don't talk about it.
[00:51:43.955 --> 00:51:45.095]  We've got sponsors.
[00:51:45.135 --> 00:51:46.016]  Remember she recorded them?
[00:51:46.036 --> 00:51:47.776]  And they said, we've got sponsors.
[00:51:48.537 --> 00:51:49.397]  She's like, sponsors?
[00:51:49.477 --> 00:51:50.277]  Who, the drug companies?
[00:51:50.638 --> 00:51:51.918]  Don't you worry about it.
[00:51:51.978 --> 00:51:52.899]  We got sponsors.
[00:51:53.259 --> 00:51:53.759]  Shut up!
[00:51:55.285 --> 00:51:57.245]  And the sponsor is the American people!
[00:51:59.346 --> 00:52:02.667]  We are paying to have these monsters kill us.
[00:52:04.147 --> 00:52:07.148]  Now, folks, this is only one thing in my stack.
[00:52:08.008 --> 00:52:09.228]  All week, stuff broke.
[00:52:09.708 --> 00:52:11.349]  Confirmed, not debated.
[00:52:11.729 --> 00:52:19.430]  Last week, the CEOs of Pfizer and Moderna go out and start giving interviews going, oh yeah, it's no big deal, by the way, our shot's really great, everybody loves it.
[00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:22.331]  We got more shots coming out that are gonna cure cancer, mRNA's great.
[00:52:23.715 --> 00:52:30.357]  Man, none of it really worked, and yeah, we made these viruses artificially in labs, and no big deal.
[00:52:31.037 --> 00:52:33.417]  They're just getting it out there, hoping you don't notice.
[00:52:35.398 --> 00:52:41.379]  It's like you come home, put your keys on the counter, go and get yourself an iced tea, a beer, whatever it is.
[00:52:41.399 --> 00:52:52.282]  You hear a little bit of noise back in the bedroom, and you go back there, and your wife's legs are behind her ears, and your neighbor, Rob, or Bob, or whatever his name is, is just going at your wife.
[00:52:52.302 --> 00:52:53.102]  I mean, you see it.
[00:52:54.113 --> 00:52:59.035]  And you're like, Bob or Bill or, you know, what are you doing?
[00:52:59.055 --> 00:53:08.478]  And then he jumps off of her and he's got sweat running down him and a big erection and your wife's got the sheets over her.
[00:53:10.738 --> 00:53:15.900]  And your neighbor says to you, let's just say your name's Wilbur.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.961]  Hey Wilbur, nothing's going on.
[00:53:18.021 --> 00:53:18.981]  You're imagining this.
[00:53:19.281 --> 00:53:21.081]  And they both jump up and say, oh, nothing happened.
[00:53:21.101 --> 00:53:22.482]  You stopped being a big troublemaker.
[00:53:24.284 --> 00:53:40.692]  I've talked to so many people that have walked in on things like that, and that's what average people do instinctively if the guy doesn't get out the window or whatever, or if the guy's caught, you know, doing the same thing, is they gaslight folks, and that's what they do.
[00:53:41.292 --> 00:53:42.753]  Okay, big deal, it doesn't work.
[00:53:42.773 --> 00:53:44.093]  Okay, big deal, there's a few problems.
[00:53:44.353 --> 00:53:46.314]  I mean, you know, come on, let's just move on.
[00:53:46.354 --> 00:53:48.175]  I mean, we got a war with Russia here.
[00:53:48.195 --> 00:53:49.876]  It's time for a war with Russia here.
[00:53:51.812 --> 00:53:55.731]   except the general public will get a lot more mad about catching your wife,
[00:53:55.731 --> 00:54:04.772]   having sex with the neighbor, or with the exterminator, or whatever, the pizza man,
[00:54:04.772 --> 00:54:12.691]  than you would on people trying to kill you.
[00:54:21.011 --> 00:54:22.812]  I just don't know what to say anymore.
[00:54:22.827 --> 00:54:25.229]  People have got to get their heads out of the sand.
[00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:28.651]  They've got to realize how serious this is and how real this is.
[00:54:29.012 --> 00:54:34.455]  I mean, do you think, folks, again, as I've said many times, that I want to go up against these murdering killers for fun?
[00:54:35.509 --> 00:54:37.791]  You think I like having them after me?
[00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:39.532]  They control the Justice Department, for God's sakes.
[00:54:39.852 --> 00:54:42.534]  Do you think I want to get killed or put in prison?
[00:54:43.035 --> 00:54:43.715]  No, I don't.
[00:54:43.956 --> 00:54:56.405]  But I cannot be a signatory, by knowing all this, to injecting the general public with a slow-kill concoction that grows mad cow crystals in them.
[00:54:57.766 --> 00:55:00.048]  That's what it causes is spongiform encephalopathy.
[00:55:00.348 --> 00:55:03.771]  That's only one aspect of this super weapon.
[00:55:06.678 --> 00:55:09.620]  And remember, silent weapons for quiet wars.
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.141]  Killing them softly.
[00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:12.382]  Soft kill.
[00:55:13.002 --> 00:55:14.243]  It's not a Brad Pitt movie.
[00:55:14.263 --> 00:55:17.285]  I was in a hotel room years ago.
[00:55:17.946 --> 00:55:18.326]  I watched.
[00:55:18.386 --> 00:55:19.507]  I said, oh, a Brad Pitt movie.
[00:55:19.547 --> 00:55:20.447]  Killing them softly.
[00:55:21.408 --> 00:55:25.190]  And, you know, he likes to kill people before they even know he's killed them.
[00:55:25.250 --> 00:55:26.231]  It's a friendly thing he does.
[00:55:26.871 --> 00:55:31.334]  And people, I got a few calls like, hey, that word soft kill, killing them softly, that's a Brad Pitt movie.
[00:55:31.775 --> 00:55:31.915]  No.
[00:55:33.035 --> 00:55:36.536]  That's obviously a movie based on a term the Pentagon uses.
[00:55:37.316 --> 00:55:43.337]  But soft kill isn't killing you instantly, where you don't know it hit you.
[00:55:43.597 --> 00:55:57.921]  It's where they kill you, but no one organizes or understands what's happened, because it kills one person in a week, kills somebody else in a year, somebody else in five years, and it makes money for the medical system itself, on average, not knowing why everybody is so sick.
[00:55:58.261 --> 00:55:59.461]  That's a soft kill weapon.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:09.024]  And we're sitting here watching them carry out the soft kill of the human population on this planet.
[00:56:10.545 --> 00:56:16.248]  And even if you don't believe in God, why in the world would you want to do that to people?
[00:56:17.108 --> 00:56:19.429]  And I know a lot of patriots are like, well, screw the left.
[00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:21.851]  You know, let them take the shots.
[00:56:21.871 --> 00:56:23.031]  I hope they take four shots.
[00:56:24.792 --> 00:56:26.033]  We can't be like that, folks.
[00:56:26.833 --> 00:56:28.054]  We can't turn into them.
[00:56:29.639 --> 00:56:34.203]  We got to warn them, we got to care about them, we got to try to forgive them if they're not consciously evil.
[00:56:34.463 --> 00:56:42.450]  If they're misled and just hate us and mind a lies, we have to realize it's our job to reach out and try to help them and then move on if they won't listen to us.
[00:56:44.412 --> 00:56:53.300]  And then you can also politically and culturally see how being Christ likes the best mode because in the system we live in, we're going to be paying for these people while they die.
[00:56:54.568 --> 00:57:01.711]  We're going to see our society collapse as half the public begins to slowly die, which has already begun from these weapons.
[00:57:02.611 --> 00:57:03.672]  The cognitive decline.
[00:57:04.312 --> 00:57:05.713]  The cardiovascular decline.
[00:57:07.453 --> 00:57:08.614]  This is Cloward and Piven 2.0.
[00:57:09.114 --> 00:57:14.356]  This is the purposeful demolition of civilization and society.
[00:57:17.258 --> 00:57:18.698]  This is 21st century war.
[00:57:20.939 --> 00:57:22.880]  So again, I will recap the big news.
[00:57:24.104 --> 00:57:26.307]  It's on Infowars.com, it's on Blaze.com.
[00:57:26.848 --> 00:57:28.149]  I want to salute Glenn Beck.
[00:57:29.331 --> 00:57:31.373]  I want to encourage people to tune into his show.
[00:57:32.515 --> 00:57:33.356]  And he's a good man.
[00:57:34.998 --> 00:57:39.584]  He didn't believe me 20 years ago or 10 years ago and he thought I was a liar.
[00:57:41.223 --> 00:57:43.064]  Because I was a man way ahead of my time.
[00:57:43.565 --> 00:57:44.986]  But he now knows the truth.
[00:57:45.646 --> 00:57:49.469]  You can tune into his show, and it sounds just like Alex Jones, except a little smoother.
[00:57:49.789 --> 00:57:52.832]  He's really better on the ears than old Gravel Voice.
[00:57:53.472 --> 00:57:55.374]  I sound like a blender with rocks in it.
[00:57:57.275 --> 00:57:58.916]  And people say, he's Alex Jones now.
[00:57:58.936 --> 00:58:00.117]  He's not Alex Jones now.
[00:58:01.999 --> 00:58:03.119]  He's reading the documents now.
[00:58:05.261 --> 00:58:08.984]  And if we can just get everybody else to look at this stuff, it's game over for the New World Order.
[00:58:12.116 --> 00:58:22.142]  And so, if I had a couple lawyers and the people and enough to have four or five extra journalists, we could be doing four years and getting this type of stuff all the time.
[00:58:22.182 --> 00:58:24.264]  But at the end of the day, that's fine.
[00:58:24.504 --> 00:58:35.791]  I'm glad to see everybody else starting to get with the program, like Joe Rogan, like Glenn Beck, like Tucker Carlson, because I don't want to be the big cheese in all this.
[00:58:36.671 --> 00:58:37.552]  I want to beat this.
[00:58:38.612 --> 00:58:40.634]  There is no future if we don't stop this.
[00:58:41.448 --> 00:58:45.170]  There's not who's the biggest talk show host and who's got the most money in the bank.
[00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:47.071]  None of that means anything.
[00:58:47.271 --> 00:58:49.012]  That might have meant something to people before.
[00:58:51.653 --> 00:58:59.897]  All that matters is being good, having a relationship with God, and being able to protect yourself and your family into the future here.
[00:59:00.698 --> 00:59:04.960]  Because we may not be able to save even a basic civilization.
[00:59:06.141 --> 00:59:10.503]  We are approaching the point of no return right now.
[00:59:12.247 --> 00:59:25.556]  And that's okay because what this is really all about is our personal relationship with God and infinity.
[00:59:28.818 --> 00:59:29.259]  Eternity.
[00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:32.261]  And that's what matters.
[00:59:36.023 --> 00:59:46.316]   Now the Bible tells us before the simulation ends, and it's a three-dimensional real simulation, Not a tabletop, a real universe-wide system.
[00:59:46.696 --> 00:59:52.618]  We don't know if the simulation ends next month or in a thousand years or a trillion years, but God gives us a pretty good idea about it.
[00:59:55.279 --> 01:00:03.501]  When the simulation is done, God rolls up the universe like a scroll, and then we jump into eternity and the next level.
[01:00:05.922 --> 01:00:12.700]   And who knows if our memories will be wiped or what, but The point is, is that's what this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:20.708]  So don't get so caught up in the game that you join with the evil so you win the game.
[01:00:23.151 --> 01:00:26.154]  You don't win the game by winning through Satan.
[01:00:26.574 --> 01:00:28.616]  You win by transcending through Christ.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.321]  And it's going to be tough.
[01:00:37.802 --> 01:00:45.228]  I just feel really sorry for people that have signed on to Evil because they have no idea what they're going to have to deal with.
[01:00:45.248 --> 01:00:56.117]  But, you know, it must be a nice, secure feeling to get tens of millions of dollars at Newsmax, tens of millions of dollars at Fox.
[01:00:56.137 --> 01:00:59.120]  I mean, I'm just singling them out because it's pathetic.
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:00.341]  I mean, good job, Blaze.
[01:01:01.942 --> 01:01:04.444]  They knew not to come to Blaze and offer them money to push the vaccine.
[01:01:04.824 --> 01:01:06.526]  They knew not to come here to offer money.
[01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:10.246]  Because you're not going to give me money and then get anything you want.
[01:01:12.227 --> 01:01:16.470]  You don't put quarters in Alex Jones and then, you know, get back out of it what you put in.
[01:01:17.551 --> 01:01:18.731]  I'm going to say what I'm going to say.
[01:01:18.972 --> 01:01:20.433]  I'm going to tell the truth the best I can.
[01:01:20.913 --> 01:01:22.774]  I'm not perfect, but I never lie on purpose.
[01:01:22.794 --> 01:01:23.375]  I make mistakes.
[01:01:23.795 --> 01:01:29.799]  And you're going to support me if you are, because you believe that and you've researched that and you want to keep that on air.
[01:01:30.139 --> 01:01:38.810]   But nobody is going to give me money and then have me Serve them.
[01:01:39.770 --> 01:01:41.712]  You can put a gun to my head.
[01:01:42.012 --> 01:01:48.717]  And I really can't even believe that lately, the folks you see all over the news attacking me have got the nerve.
[01:01:51.479 --> 01:01:58.645]  After I've already had some of the biggest people in the world offer me money to stop what I'm doing.
[01:02:00.326 --> 01:02:01.427]  And I told them I can't stop.
[01:02:04.509 --> 01:02:07.947]   Last time I got offered a bunch of money was three years ago.
[01:02:07.947 --> 01:02:19.148]   And I've been offered money by governments and I went to the FBI over it.
[01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:20.876]  That's how the real world works, folks.
[01:02:21.276 --> 01:02:23.057]  And you're looking at the guy.
[01:02:23.277 --> 01:02:24.558]  I'm not bragging, I'm just telling you.
[01:02:24.818 --> 01:02:26.759]  You're looking at the guy that can't be bought.
[01:02:26.819 --> 01:02:27.119]  Right here.
[01:02:27.679 --> 01:02:28.180]  Looking for it?
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:29.340]  This is it right here.
[01:02:30.481 --> 01:02:31.421]  This is the real thing.
[01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:33.402]  This is the real McCoy, warts and all.
[01:02:33.963 --> 01:02:34.743]  You got it right here.
[01:02:34.963 --> 01:02:35.924]  And I know you're just like me.
[01:02:36.834 --> 01:02:41.935]  You're black, you're Hispanic, you're Asian, you're white, you're every color, but you love God and you love justice and you can't be bought either.
[01:02:42.396 --> 01:02:53.479]  And that's why they want to collapse everything with a social credit score to have you so desperate and so surveilled that you'll start bending to their will and we can't let them ever do that.
[01:02:54.859 --> 01:02:58.100]  And I'm telling you, when you don't let them bend your will, it becomes the opposite.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:00.401]  When they try to bend, you get even stronger.
[01:03:00.701 --> 01:03:04.222]  Instead of when they try to bend you, you start bending them.
[01:03:05.774 --> 01:03:07.934]  And the harder they push, the stronger we get.
[01:03:07.954 --> 01:03:08.595]  You understand that?
[01:03:11.675 --> 01:03:14.116]  They try to bend me, the opposite, I get stronger.
[01:03:15.416 --> 01:03:18.237]  They attack me, they persecute me, boom!
[01:03:19.017 --> 01:03:21.277]  That opens up new levels of energy and discernment.
[01:03:21.737 --> 01:03:22.998]  God goes, oh, they're hitting you with that?
[01:03:23.178 --> 01:03:23.958]  How about this?
[01:03:26.258 --> 01:03:34.260]  And that's the experience you want to have, is the enemy comes up against you, and then God opens up a whole nother area.
[01:03:34.889 --> 01:03:36.510]  And that's what evil already knows.
[01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:39.692]  The entity running this is a loser.
[01:03:40.412 --> 01:03:42.353]  Has already lost countless times.
[01:03:44.535 --> 01:03:47.596]  And is there as the tester to fulfill a duty.
[01:03:50.598 --> 01:03:54.260]  So again, thank God that you're awake.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.561]  Thank God you know what's going on.
[01:03:55.641 --> 01:04:02.305]  And thank God you're not Fox News or Newsmax or CNN or MSNBC.
[01:04:02.525 --> 01:04:03.926]  And good job, The Blaze.
[01:04:05.976 --> 01:04:07.257]  You didn't take the money either.
[01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:10.339]  And don't you know Joe Rogan?
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:14.382]  Has had all sorts of stuff thrown at him and he'll just roll over.
[01:04:16.184 --> 01:04:24.350]  And you know, what that does with somebody like Joe, it goes from Joe being on the fence a year ago, like they couldn't really do this on purpose.
[01:04:24.390 --> 01:04:27.953]  I mean, they're not really evil to like, whoa, they're really evil.
[01:04:29.028 --> 01:04:30.628]  And see, that's the thing about the quickening.
[01:04:31.149 --> 01:04:38.751]  As the evil and the corruption gets more and more right out in the open, right in everybody's faces, it's going to force people to choose a side.
[01:04:39.311 --> 01:04:41.872]  And some people you thought were good are going to join evil.
[01:04:42.072 --> 01:04:44.492]  And some people you thought evil are going to join good.
[01:04:45.893 --> 01:04:50.114]  There's going to be a lot of people you always knew were evil that are just going to get more evil.
[01:04:50.454 --> 01:04:54.555]  And there's always going to be people you knew were good that just get even better.
[01:04:56.246 --> 01:05:03.588]  And that's the great experience of this for the next level of our consciousness and the adventure that awaits there.
[01:05:04.148 --> 01:05:16.872]  Because if anything has been gotten wrong by the theologians and the culture and the rest of it, is that the next level you just sit there and play a harp and everything's just happy and total perfection.
[01:05:17.292 --> 01:05:25.203]   If you choose to be in that presence and be complete, You can choose to stay there and be complete in God's presence.
[01:05:25.643 --> 01:05:33.025]  You can choose to stay at that level of absolute connection to infinity and true attainment.
[01:05:33.825 --> 01:05:45.545]  Or you can go to places outside of the consciousness of God.
[01:05:45.545 --> 01:05:54.425]   Satan was attempting to make one of those places at this level.
[01:05:54.575 --> 01:05:56.616]  Those places have been constructed.
[01:05:57.857 --> 01:05:59.058]  And those places exist.
[01:06:02.279 --> 01:06:04.761]  And I can tell you, my friends, I've been beyond Satan.
[01:06:08.003 --> 01:06:09.703]  There's only one way to go beyond Satan.
[01:06:10.604 --> 01:06:11.284]  And that's with God.
[01:06:13.766 --> 01:06:31.491]   Unlimited knowledge of all space and time, of all possible realities, And of other breakaway universes, of other consciousness, an endless infinity of consciousness.
[01:06:35.334 --> 01:06:39.636]  Now, do you really want to serve Hollywood and the devil and all these hunchback demons?
[01:06:39.656 --> 01:06:40.217]  I mean, really?
[01:06:40.577 --> 01:06:40.737]  No.
[01:06:41.678 --> 01:06:45.800]   No one, including their own minions, should want to be part of this.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:51.746]  But they want to pretend the easy way, serving the devil, is power.
[01:06:51.966 --> 01:06:52.967]  And it's not power.
[01:06:53.608 --> 01:06:59.134]  The easy way is never where you find the power.
[01:06:59.854 --> 01:07:06.441]  But once you've got the real power, you don't want the power anymore.
[01:07:07.165 --> 01:07:08.905]  You want consciousness.
[01:07:09.365 --> 01:07:10.426]  You want connection.
[01:07:10.486 --> 01:07:11.386]  You want love.
[01:07:11.706 --> 01:07:12.846]  You want expansion.
[01:07:13.206 --> 01:07:14.286]  You want creativity.
[01:07:14.566 --> 01:07:15.587]  And you want freedom.
[01:07:17.747 --> 01:07:19.627]  And so you allow evil to exist.
[01:07:22.468 --> 01:07:22.908]  And that's all.
[01:07:25.629 --> 01:07:28.329]  God did not commit a crime by giving us consciousness.
[01:07:28.909 --> 01:07:31.370]  But God allowed evil into the universe.
[01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:33.330]  By allowing free will.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.181]  And I don't fault God for that.
[01:07:38.281 --> 01:07:39.122]  I thank God for that.
[01:07:39.642 --> 01:07:40.803]  So let's continue on here.
[01:07:42.665 --> 01:07:48.590]  Newsmax CEO Biden should be applauded for vaccine efforts.
[01:07:48.971 --> 01:07:52.694]  I wonder when Chris Reddy went out and gave those speeches and wrote those articles.
[01:07:54.676 --> 01:07:57.218]  I wonder when he put out Newsmax headlines.
[01:07:58.973 --> 01:08:04.896]  In July of last year, right when the Biden money went out, Biden's good job on the vaccine.
[01:08:05.296 --> 01:08:07.577]  And, you know, I don't want to single out.
[01:08:07.797 --> 01:08:08.557]  We show people this place.
[01:08:10.258 --> 01:08:11.278]  I don't want to single out.
[01:08:13.279 --> 01:08:14.120]  Chris Ruddy, it's just.
[01:08:16.421 --> 01:08:16.841]  There it is.
[01:08:20.783 --> 01:08:25.825]  And of course, you notice he's probably the smart guy, you know, he's got a limo driver and everything he.
[01:08:28.291 --> 01:08:30.072]  He gets to stay on all the cable channels.
[01:08:31.233 --> 01:08:33.855]  But OAN and everybody else, they get taken off.
[01:08:33.915 --> 01:08:34.655]  See how it works.
[01:08:36.516 --> 01:08:40.419]  But see, they don't want you to know they took the money.
[01:08:42.581 --> 01:08:43.921]  So that's just one of the stories.
[01:08:44.562 --> 01:08:45.983]  Then we've got all these right here.
[01:08:46.283 --> 01:08:47.604]  Let's just move these a little bit quicker.
[01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:57.595]   Let's get that clip ready of the head of the CDC saying it because I don't want to just tell you about it.
[01:08:57.615 --> 01:08:58.417]  I want to play it for you.
[01:08:58.958 --> 01:09:00.761]  Unlike corporate media, they would not show you that.
[01:09:01.262 --> 01:09:06.691]  CDC director finally admits realities that used to get people banned.
[01:09:07.302 --> 01:09:14.181]   Town Hall reports. Oh, but now she's allowed to lie to you and censor you and control you.
[01:09:14.181 --> 01:09:19.782]   And then now she's like, "Oh, 95%? Oh, well, it wasn't really that good." Yeah, it creates a
[01:09:19.782 --> 01:09:26.181]   negative immunity worse than before you took it within eight months. And that's just the Pfizer.
[01:09:26.181 --> 01:09:33.702]   Moderna is even worse. And in children, it immediately creates a negative immunity.
[01:09:33.874 --> 01:09:38.718]  So it immediately makes children more susceptible to what they're claiming they're fighting.
[01:09:39.739 --> 01:09:42.261]  And they finally go, okay, let's not give it to five and younger.
[01:09:43.301 --> 01:09:44.102]  What a freak show.
[01:09:44.963 --> 01:09:50.227]  And that's only because there's enough scientists and people in the government to go, whoa, this is, you're taking money to do this?
[01:09:50.247 --> 01:09:51.167]  This is a scandal.
[01:09:51.468 --> 01:09:53.069]  You're going to destroy our credibility.
[01:09:53.109 --> 01:09:53.970]  What's your problem?
[01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:55.471]  Remember what the British government?
[01:09:56.755 --> 01:10:02.660]  Said a year and a half ago, they said we need to yellow slip this vaccine, because it started there earlier than here, than a month of it.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:03.720]  That means pull it.
[01:10:04.541 --> 01:10:10.966]  And then, what did that FDA board member say that came out in the news a year ago?
[01:10:11.927 --> 01:10:20.934]  They said, you're going to destroy belief in vaccines and the medical system for generations.
[01:10:23.883 --> 01:10:24.803]  Again, the perfect storm.
[01:10:25.063 --> 01:10:33.302]   Big banks, big media, big pharma, big tech, all together, ganging up to make hundreds of billions of dollars, forcing
[01:10:33.302 --> 01:10:37.731]   poison on us that they knew was poison, that they thought they'd get away with, and they think they
[01:10:37.731 --> 01:10:38.742]  are getting away with it.
[01:10:38.742 --> 01:10:52.742]  Here is the head of the CDC, Walensky.
[01:10:52.742 --> 01:10:57.742]  Thank you.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.982]  Where could we have improved?
[01:10:57.663 --> 01:11:06.052]  Well, you know, I think I can tell you where I was when the CNN feed came that it was 95% effective, the vaccine.
[01:11:06.813 --> 01:11:08.495]  So many of us wanted to be hopeful.
[01:11:08.695 --> 01:11:12.339]  So many of us wanted to say, OK, this is our ticket out right now.
[01:11:12.579 --> 01:11:13.600]  We're done.
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:21.311]   So I think we have perhaps Too little caution and too much optimism for some good things that came our way.
[01:11:21.971 --> 01:11:22.611]  I really do.
[01:11:22.631 --> 01:11:25.353]  I think all of us wanted this to be done.
[01:11:26.253 --> 01:11:30.676]  Nobody said waning when, you know, this vaccine's going to work.
[01:11:30.776 --> 01:11:33.397]  Oh, well, maybe it'll work, it'll wear off.
[01:11:34.278 --> 01:11:39.441]  Nobody said, well, what if the next variant doesn't, it doesn't, it's not as potent against the next variant.
[01:11:42.031 --> 01:11:44.593]  It's not that it doesn't work against the next variant.
[01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:45.614]  They always said that.
[01:11:45.995 --> 01:11:48.137]  It doesn't work against COVID-19.
[01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:49.298]  It's bull.
[01:11:49.998 --> 01:11:56.865]  People are way more likely to get sick or hospitalized or die in all the studies if they've taken this injection.
[01:11:57.145 --> 01:11:57.986]  And I've already gone over that.
[01:11:58.186 --> 01:11:59.948]  But you point that out, they censor you.
[01:12:00.608 --> 01:12:03.431]  Because they're raping you of your medical rights.
[01:12:03.771 --> 01:12:04.732]  They're surveilling you.
[01:12:04.772 --> 01:12:07.795]  And now they're raping your body and putting something into it.
[01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:12.017]  And notice they're phasing this out now.
[01:12:12.257 --> 01:12:15.218]  Oh, CDC, 92% of U.S.
[01:12:15.238 --> 01:12:16.919]  population can ditch the mask.
[01:12:17.519 --> 01:12:21.001]  Oh, the government tells me that I can ditch the mask now.
[01:12:23.922 --> 01:12:27.144]  But it appears the Austin City Council doesn't trust the CDC.
[01:12:27.164 --> 01:12:30.405]  They're all still wearing theirs.
[01:12:33.127 --> 01:12:35.728]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:12:38.974 --> 01:12:46.315]  And you see workers on the side of the road in Texas and Florida and other states digging ditches.
[01:12:46.515 --> 01:12:59.378]  I saw workers in Texas and in Florida last week, been in both states, putting in pipelines, digging in the ditches, doing a bunch of road work, but both cases on the side of the road.
[01:13:00.858 --> 01:13:02.778]  One was in an airport, one was in the road here in Austin.
[01:13:05.219 --> 01:13:06.759]  And they're all wearing masks outside.
[01:13:08.558 --> 01:13:12.701]  It's a sign of subservience because the corporations tell them keep doing it.
[01:13:12.901 --> 01:13:14.282]  They'll never take them off.
[01:13:16.404 --> 01:13:17.805]  Another video I want to play in a moment.
[01:13:18.245 --> 01:13:25.231]  Bayer executive brags mRNA shots are gene therapy marketed as vaccines.
[01:13:25.251 --> 01:13:35.319]  I'm going to hit this news and the rest of the story in a moment, but here's the clip of them bragging about it at the World Health Summit and the UN.
[01:13:35.339 --> 01:13:35.699]  Here it is.
[01:13:38.222 --> 01:13:42.926]  Ultimately, the mRNA vaccines are an example for that cell and gene therapy.
[01:13:42.966 --> 01:13:52.874]  I always like to say, if we had surveyed two years ago in the public, would you be willing to take a gene or cell therapy and inject it into your body?
[01:13:53.314 --> 01:13:55.977]  We would have probably had a 95% refusal rate.
[01:13:56.157 --> 01:14:04.524]  I think this pandemic has also opened many people's eyes to innovation in a way that was maybe not possible before.
[01:14:07.188 --> 01:14:08.268]  That was always the plan.
[01:14:08.409 --> 01:14:09.529]  You can go back two years ago.
[01:14:09.549 --> 01:14:11.150]  I said, they're going to give you the gene therapy.
[01:14:11.970 --> 01:14:20.614]  And when it makes you sick and others sick, the general public's been trained to have conflict avoidance and just be delusional and not get pissed and say, let's bring him to justice.
[01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:21.954]  So this doesn't happen anymore.
[01:14:21.974 --> 01:14:22.014]  No.
[01:14:22.074 --> 01:14:22.214]  No.
[01:14:24.895 --> 01:14:26.275]  Let's be like the Communist Chinese.
[01:14:26.315 --> 01:14:29.176]  Let's just go along with it and say everything's okay.
[01:14:29.517 --> 01:14:30.317]  Then you'll get promoted.
[01:14:30.777 --> 01:14:35.439]  And so they said back then, oh, this is a gene therapy in their prospectuses to their shareholders.
[01:14:36.219 --> 01:14:37.879]  But we can't let the public know that right now.
[01:14:37.919 --> 01:14:38.980]  Let's roll it out first.
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:42.321]  And once it's successful, we'll say, now we've got it for cancer.
[01:14:42.601 --> 01:14:44.041]  And now we've got it for depression.
[01:14:44.322 --> 01:14:45.802]  And now we've got it for your skin.
[01:14:46.102 --> 01:14:47.663]  And now we've got it for your guts.
[01:14:47.943 --> 01:14:49.423]  And now we've got it for your liver.
[01:14:49.703 --> 01:14:51.504]  And now we've got it for everything.
[01:14:55.549 --> 01:14:56.409]  And now he tells you.
[01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:08.975]  Bayer, the same folks in the 90s through the 80s that shipped out millions of ampules of factor VIII that they knew had HIV and hepatitis in it that they estimate killed 2 million people.
[01:15:09.315 --> 01:15:14.077]  And the Bayer executives then were in lawsuits and admitted, well, who cares about hemophiliacs?
[01:15:14.117 --> 01:15:14.998]  There's too many of them.
[01:15:15.458 --> 01:15:15.798]  Look it up.
[01:15:18.083 --> 01:15:19.163]  Like, where do they get these people?
[01:15:19.523 --> 01:15:25.164]  Well, because the mad scientists want control of the medical system because they want to be able to kill people.
[01:15:25.444 --> 01:15:29.665]  How many nurses you hear about where the woman secretly kills 15 babies and finally gets caught?
[01:15:30.505 --> 01:15:32.846]  Or another nurse gets caught killing heart patients.
[01:15:33.286 --> 01:15:39.927]  And then they just, most of the time, they get slipped under the rug because a small minority of medical workers are psychotic killers.
[01:15:43.608 --> 01:15:46.409]  Again, if you're a radio listener, you can search anything I'm saying and pull it up.
[01:15:46.449 --> 01:15:47.749]  That's what the crew's doing right now.
[01:15:49.397 --> 01:15:50.697]  They intentionally did it.
[01:15:50.757 --> 01:15:51.278]  They knew.
[01:15:51.398 --> 01:15:52.418]  Oh, and who was involved?
[01:15:54.199 --> 01:16:01.581]  Over half the blood that was shipped worldwide came from one state, Arkansas, where no HIV testing was done.
[01:16:01.621 --> 01:16:02.661]  They would falsify the reports.
[01:16:03.021 --> 01:16:06.062]  They would test for no blood diseases, cutting out massive expense.
[01:16:06.342 --> 01:16:13.605]  They would claim it was clean, sell it to a multinational mafia conglomerate, and then sell it to Bayer.
[01:16:17.346 --> 01:16:18.046]  Can you imagine?
[01:16:20.796 --> 01:16:22.277]  But, oh, let's hear that one more time.
[01:16:22.757 --> 01:16:26.939]  Bayer exec brags mRNA shots are gene therapy, market is vaccines.
[01:16:26.959 --> 01:16:33.522]  He's like, oh, who would have thought before this, you know, 95% would have said no if it was a gene therapy.
[01:16:33.542 --> 01:16:55.384]   But see, now we've had all the politifacts and all the different fact-checking groups, USA Today, you name it, Microsoft Shield, News Guard, come out and tell us That it's not a gene therapy and it doesn't change the DNA, even though all the studies say it does.
[01:16:55.684 --> 01:17:01.473]  And before they launched this, they bragged it was mRNA, but couldn't get it approved because it killed so many people.
[01:17:02.855 --> 01:17:05.980]  And I know I'm harping on this, folks, but man, this is sick!
[01:17:07.233 --> 01:17:11.174]  Now if you go on Twitter or Instagram and you say it's a gene therapy, you'll be banned.
[01:17:11.574 --> 01:17:24.238]  He's allowed to get up there and laugh and say it is and say, we just raped you and now since I've raped you once, I rape you once, I rape you twice, I won't let go at any price.
[01:17:26.878 --> 01:17:28.878]  That's what this is.
[01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:36.557]  Look at this guy.
[01:17:36.557 --> 01:17:46.557]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:17:37.657 --> 01:17:42.201]  His name's Stephan Olick.
[01:17:44.582 --> 01:17:46.284]  Here he is, rubbing it in your face.
[01:17:46.324 --> 01:17:50.367]  He just raped you, intimidated you, told you it was the law all over the world.
[01:17:50.407 --> 01:17:51.148]  You can't have a job.
[01:17:51.188 --> 01:17:51.748]  You can't live.
[01:17:51.988 --> 01:17:52.849]  You're a terrible person.
[01:17:52.869 --> 01:17:55.951]  If you don't take an experimental shot, they told you it wasn't experimental.
[01:17:56.111 --> 01:17:56.512]  Here it is.
[01:17:57.453 --> 01:18:02.757]  Cell therapy and inject it into your body, we would have probably had a 95% refusal rate.
[01:18:02.937 --> 01:18:11.322]  I think this pandemic has also opened many people's eyes to innovation in the way that was maybe not possible before.
[01:18:12.303 --> 01:18:12.803]  So there you go.
[01:18:12.823 --> 01:18:15.485]  All right, let's continue.
[01:18:16.066 --> 01:18:20.308]  Let's look at an article that links directly to the documents.
[01:18:21.569 --> 01:18:25.212]  It's out of Stat News, big statistical site.
[01:18:26.857 --> 01:18:29.799]  And this article was out a long time ago, but it's been republished.
[01:18:31.179 --> 01:18:41.425]  And it goes into how lavishly funded Moderna by Bill Gates and the Defense Department hit safety problems in bold bid to revolutionize medicine.
[01:18:41.785 --> 01:18:47.588]  So you just heard one of the top executives at Bayer say that's why they did this, but this is them years ago.
[01:18:52.150 --> 01:19:04.701]   And it goes into how they set all this up And how they developed these systems, but how they had so many problems in trials with them having bad results or killing people, that Moderna was in trouble.
[01:19:05.261 --> 01:19:06.623]  You've got to go read this whole article.
[01:19:07.064 --> 01:19:13.352]  Laboriously funded Moderna hits safety problems in bold bid to revolutionize medicine.
[01:19:13.612 --> 01:19:14.834]  That's from Yahoo News.
[01:19:17.816 --> 01:19:21.178]  And it goes on to say, but mRNA is a tricky technology.
[01:19:21.238 --> 01:19:31.463]  Several major pharmaceutical companies have tried and abandoned the idea, struggling to get mRNA into cells without triggering nasty side effects.
[01:19:32.903 --> 01:19:33.364]  Nasty.
[01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:42.668]  But what do you think happens to people I know in my own family when I try to call them with this?
[01:19:43.609 --> 01:19:44.869]  People I've known my whole life.
[01:19:45.169 --> 01:19:46.330]  People I've been really nice to.
[01:19:49.229 --> 01:19:51.191]  And you send them this, they block you.
[01:19:52.572 --> 01:19:54.914]  You try to go to their house and give it to them, they won't open the door.
[01:19:57.416 --> 01:20:02.180]  Because they don't want to admit they got hurt, they got attacked, it's too scary.
[01:20:02.441 --> 01:20:09.387]  They're gonna say you're the bad person for telling them, hey don't take that, it'll have nasty side effects, because the real effect is to be nasty.
[01:20:10.908 --> 01:20:14.311]  That's not true, you think you know it all, fact checkers say.
[01:20:15.905 --> 01:20:18.328]  And it's a spirit of delusion.
[01:20:18.768 --> 01:20:23.853]  Most of my family's awake, but I have family that will not talk to me.
[01:20:25.995 --> 01:20:31.581]  And one of them took both the Pfizer shots and got sick both times and is now lost.
[01:20:33.323 --> 01:20:35.866]  Most of their weight, it looked like a concentration camp victim.
[01:20:38.328 --> 01:20:39.288]  It won't talk to me.
[01:20:39.288 --> 01:20:48.648]  You gotta go read this article.
[01:20:48.658 --> 01:20:49.858]  You gotta go read the whole damn thing.
[01:20:50.239 --> 01:20:54.601]  It's how, oh, this company tried, and that company tried, and oh, it hurt people, and it killed them.
[01:20:54.822 --> 01:21:02.586]  But Moderna's trying, and then it's Bill Gates, and then they cook the virus up, release it, stampede it, won't let us tell you what it is, block us everywhere.
[01:21:06.509 --> 01:21:09.971]  And then the left themselves call for me to be put in jail and prison everywhere.
[01:21:10.151 --> 01:21:10.991]  There's articles every day.
[01:21:15.935 --> 01:21:16.695]  Yeah, there's another one.
[01:21:18.032 --> 01:21:19.673]  Vaccines causing prion disease.
[01:21:21.373 --> 01:21:22.514]  It's just so weird.
[01:21:24.574 --> 01:21:25.535]  It's such a curse.
[01:21:26.675 --> 01:21:27.335]  It's a spirit.
[01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:29.276]  They're all programmed.
[01:21:29.296 --> 01:21:32.497]  They all got that same weird look in their eye, too.
[01:21:32.537 --> 01:21:33.598]  It's like body snatchers.
[01:21:34.878 --> 01:21:37.399]  You know, maybe I should just read this whole article on air.
[01:21:37.219 --> 01:21:46.578]   there. I mean it's just incredible. And the whistleblowers and in other times
[01:21:46.578 --> 01:21:49.338]   they had whistleblowers come out of these companies and they'd have to stop
[01:21:49.338 --> 01:21:52.698]   it. And the biggest thing it does if you read the articles that are linked from
[01:21:52.698 --> 01:21:57.338]  this, that's what I did, is it it eats the liver.
[01:21:55.819 --> 01:22:03.423]  The biggest problems when they try to cure cancer and stuff is they've got mRNA technology that will literally kill cancer.
[01:22:03.963 --> 01:22:06.123]  But then six months later, your liver liquefies.
[01:22:06.123 --> 01:22:11.663]  Man.
[01:22:11.663 --> 01:22:22.764]  And this is them giving speeches and admitting all of this.
[01:22:23.048 --> 01:22:24.268]  A bug in the software.
[01:22:25.208 --> 01:22:29.329]  And it just goes into how they actually create it artificially with machines and computers.
[01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:31.850]  It doesn't even come from biological viruses.
[01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:33.670]  So they go, oh, this is good.
[01:22:33.710 --> 01:22:35.091]  It's not grown on dead babies.
[01:22:36.211 --> 01:22:37.991]  Except they use sequences from the dead babies.
[01:22:39.471 --> 01:22:41.631]  And then they create it artificially in a lab.
[01:22:41.631 --> 01:22:53.230]   So they cook the virus up, they release it, it kills a bunch of people.
[01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:57.791]   Then the vaccine creates the same thing in the body, it kills a bunch of people.
[01:22:57.791 --> 01:23:02.911]   And it's all based on, they want to bring this to market and test it on us
[01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:06.350]  and then find out what actually works.
[01:23:06.601 --> 01:23:07.521]  And that's what's going on.
[01:23:07.541 --> 01:23:10.842]  They want to have billions of guinea pigs.
[01:23:10.942 --> 01:23:11.863]  Now, who else did this?
[01:23:12.163 --> 01:23:13.423]  Who else just got convicted?
[01:23:15.242 --> 01:23:19.025]  Elizabeth Holmes was a frontwoman for Bill Gates and a bunch of other big companies.
[01:23:19.465 --> 01:23:25.069]  She claimed that her Theranos technology could do 100 blood tests or more with just a small amount of blood.
[01:23:25.449 --> 01:23:27.050]  It was all a giant fraud.
[01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:28.491]  It was all a giant scam.
[01:23:30.653 --> 01:23:41.160]  And the way they were setting the machines to find different breakdown chemicals from cancer, a bunch of people were told they had cancer that didn't have cancer.
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:47.842]  And this is a scam that went on for almost a decade with them just having to up the scam, up the scam.
[01:23:48.082 --> 01:23:55.964]  But at least this isn't something that literally cuts your DNA and gives you cancer like what Moderna just did.
[01:23:58.385 --> 01:24:00.385]  And again, they've dumped their stock.
[01:24:01.345 --> 01:24:03.366]  They've all deleted their Twitter accounts.
[01:24:04.534 --> 01:24:06.836]  And I guess they think they're not all going to go to prison.
[01:24:07.156 --> 01:24:11.238]  And I kept asking this question a couple of years ago when this all started, this latest phase.
[01:24:11.298 --> 01:24:13.160]  I said, how are they going to get away with this?
[01:24:14.661 --> 01:24:16.202]  Well, they're going to, you can go read it.
[01:24:16.222 --> 01:24:17.062]  They tell you next.
[01:24:17.883 --> 01:24:21.245]  You look back on the COVID as a nice memory.
[01:24:22.506 --> 01:24:33.193]  Soon the cyber attacks and starving third world populations will overwhelm the West and that a new system will be needed to correct it.
[01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:41.280]  I listen to Klaus Schwab so you don't have to, but let me tell you, it's rough.
[01:24:41.801 --> 01:24:49.383]  I mean, you're listening to a real villain that makes Bond villains look like sweethearts, that makes Batman villains look like angels.
[01:24:51.204 --> 01:24:56.106]  And my father, who I love a lot, almost died from Delta.
[01:24:57.126 --> 01:24:58.527]  My mother was the sickest she's ever been.
[01:24:58.887 --> 01:25:00.548]  Robb Due almost died.
[01:25:01.368 --> 01:25:03.549]  He's still seriously sick from what he went through.
[01:25:04.549 --> 01:25:06.390]  I had other family that died.
[01:25:07.361 --> 01:25:11.985]  I felt like I had a thousand pound gorilla sitting on my chest for two weeks.
[01:25:12.245 --> 01:25:13.486]  Didn't make a big issue out of it at the time.
[01:25:13.546 --> 01:25:14.347]  I was on air with it.
[01:25:16.248 --> 01:25:19.411]  And of course the tests were saying negative because it's all just BS, folks.
[01:25:19.431 --> 01:25:29.190]  There's a real virus though.
[01:25:29.190 --> 01:25:34.870]   So if somebody came to my house and had my dad in the back of a truck and it beat him
[01:25:34.870 --> 01:25:37.751]  up and almost killed him.
[01:25:37.714 --> 01:25:41.420]  I would either have the police get justice on them, or one way or another I'd get justice.
[01:25:42.241 --> 01:25:47.009]  And I'm not calling for going out and being violent with Moderna and Pfizer and the rest of them, because they're going to go down in the end.
[01:25:49.793 --> 01:25:51.496]  But I want it to sink in to everybody.
[01:25:53.496 --> 01:25:57.778]  That we have a job to do, and that's exposing these monsters.
[01:25:58.219 --> 01:26:01.641]  And the thing they can't handle is the light of day and the truth coming out.
[01:26:02.201 --> 01:26:14.328]  And as long as you expose what they've done, as long as you share the articles and the videos at InfoWars.com and Bandot Video and Glenn Beck's great work, hallelujah, that he's so awake now, praise God.
[01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:18.230]  I get it now.
[01:26:18.290 --> 01:26:22.132]  He thought I was a complete lunatic and just telling people horrible, scary things for no reason.
[01:26:23.513 --> 01:26:26.595]  Because he hadn't done as much research as I had, and now he's done it, and now he knows.
[01:26:28.496 --> 01:26:28.916]  That's good.
[01:26:31.538 --> 01:26:40.543]  But the point is, is that... With a big platform, Glenn Beck... That's one of the paintings he gave me, yeah.
[01:26:43.385 --> 01:26:47.647]  Glenn Beck is the biggest show we've got that's getting deeply into the Great Reset and the New World Order.
[01:26:48.107 --> 01:26:51.528]  Rogan's bigger, but he's only getting into some of it.
[01:26:51.548 --> 01:26:52.669]  He's starting to really get it.
[01:26:52.689 --> 01:26:55.650]  Because Joe wants to know something frontwards and backwards before he covers it.
[01:26:56.050 --> 01:26:57.690]  Carlson's hitting it some, and that's good.
[01:26:58.451 --> 01:27:10.775]  But I keep obsessing on Glenn Beck because... I mean, if Glenn Beck gets really good and fully awake... I'm going to hand the baton to Owen, or I'm out of here, man.
[01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:11.996]  I just, uh...
[01:27:15.489 --> 01:27:20.413]  And it's not even that, it's not even that I don't want to be here and be on air anymore.
[01:27:23.795 --> 01:27:29.240]  I just feel like it's time for other people to stand up and fight this.
[01:27:32.402 --> 01:27:40.889]  And I think it's almost better if I just recede into the background, but we'll see what happens.
[01:27:42.264 --> 01:27:43.525]  I just have always felt like that.
[01:27:43.565 --> 01:27:53.693]  I've always had this imprint that I'm going to wake people up and there'll be this big event and then the big, the globalists make their move and that I will just sit back and watch it.
[01:27:54.634 --> 01:27:55.495]  But we'll see what happens.
[01:27:55.515 --> 01:28:00.279]  The point is I'm just ruminating and cogitating here on air.
[01:28:00.299 --> 01:28:01.660]  But we need more people to get awake.
[01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:11.708]  We need more prominent people to know what's going on because if we expose this, this will crack the code and we can lessen what the globalists are about to do.
[01:28:13.342 --> 01:28:22.169]  Before I get back into Russia, I want to hit the biggest piece of news concerning COVID, and that's Bill Gates and his now ex-wife, Melinda French Gates.
[01:28:25.752 --> 01:28:31.657]  And what that means here in just a moment, but I just want to, I want to say this and get this out there.
[01:28:34.639 --> 01:28:37.482]  The globalists are control freaks.
[01:28:41.267 --> 01:29:08.895]  And with the hyper development of technology and what Ray Kurzweil calls the singularity, whether that's going to happen or not, something like that is happening with industries within just a matter of years and then months and then weeks and then days that will be made obsolete because of the development of incredible systems and computing.
[01:29:09.679 --> 01:29:43.947]   And also because humans aren't valuing... Also because humans are not valuing tradition enough, and valuing our ancient history, and being very slow now that things are moving so quickly, we need to be very careful about what we adopt, or what's rolled out, because it's always filled with predatory, progen horses.
[01:29:43.947 --> 01:29:53.466]   And so when they say looking forward to the end of humanity as their maxim,
[01:29:53.466 --> 01:29:58.826]   they're saying we're degenerate, we're evil, we sold out, we're scared, we want to just
[01:29:58.826 --> 01:30:05.146]  go to maximum overdrive science and have huge breakthroughs.
[01:30:05.136 --> 01:30:08.495]  that let us escape death and escape judgment.
[01:30:08.495 --> 01:30:13.615]   And of course, when you get a cult like this going, they're not going to ever admit that you can't upload
[01:30:13.615 --> 01:30:15.615]  somebody's consciousness into a computer.
[01:30:15.615 --> 01:30:18.575]  They're not going to ever admit that this is a fraud.
[01:30:18.575 --> 01:30:29.855]   And so that's why the big crime is when you've got some dude winning the track and field events,
[01:30:29.855 --> 01:30:33.776]   the swimming events, the weightlifting events, the MMA fights.
[01:30:33.968 --> 01:30:35.609]  Men now are dominating worldwide.
[01:30:35.649 --> 01:30:38.630]  The Olympics, collegiate, you name it, high school.
[01:30:40.371 --> 01:30:45.334]  Men are now, just five years ago, men were in a few of the fields as women winning.
[01:30:46.434 --> 01:30:52.257]  Now every major sport, women's sport, is dominated by men.
[01:30:53.398 --> 01:31:14.593]   And if you'll accept a man, With shoulders twice as wide as the women, still with their genitals, up there competing against your daughter, or your wife, or your sister, or your mother.
[01:31:15.788 --> 01:31:17.108]  You'll put up with anything.
[01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:20.769]  And that's the big lie, is that we've transcended death.
[01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:24.350]  2045 is here, but we need you to give up that carbon body.
[01:31:24.871 --> 01:31:29.572]  And the AI will be able to sound like your dad or your mom, or your neighbor, or your son or daughter.
[01:31:30.012 --> 01:31:31.753]  The AI will be able to do everything.
[01:31:32.093 --> 01:31:33.933]  And, oh, don't you want to scan your brain?
[01:31:34.033 --> 01:31:34.893]  You've got cancer.
[01:31:35.294 --> 01:31:38.975]  Oh, in case you're in a car wreck, or you're in the military, let's scan your brain.
[01:31:40.075 --> 01:31:43.796]  And scientists will debate whether this version is really purely a human.
[01:31:45.816 --> 01:32:08.054]  And then they'll say, we finally have one that we've captured what is the essence and it will be a crime punishable by death to deny the hologram consciousness and that the AI gods have created in a new eternal ethereal digital Superman.
[01:32:10.712 --> 01:32:12.352]  I've told you that for 20 plus years.
[01:32:12.833 --> 01:32:15.933]  Now the heads of the Davos Group give speeches saying it.
[01:32:19.114 --> 01:32:23.194]   And just like this vaccine isn't a vaccine and gives you death, not life,
[01:32:23.194 --> 01:32:28.873]   and just like Theranos is a scam, and just like everything they do is a lie,
[01:32:28.873 --> 01:32:34.074]  this system they're offering you is another giant lie.
[01:32:43.674 --> 01:32:51.994]   I need to hit the Russia news, but I want to hit the Bill and Melinda Gates news.
[01:32:52.152 --> 01:32:57.539]  And that ties into the takeover of the medical system, the takeover of the medical leaders.
[01:33:01.764 --> 01:33:02.525]  That ties in.
[01:33:05.029 --> 01:33:23.300]  To what Gates is working for in this eugenics, transhumanist cult, why they were using money payoffs and pedophilia and drugs to get all the major academics on board so they could do things like launch a COVID-19 and a poison mRNA shot and have them all try to gaslight us and get away with it.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:26.162]  That was the corruption they were using.
[01:33:27.443 --> 01:33:37.680]   And so at a certain point, as I said, I had heard over a year ago before the divorce even started, that she was going to leave him Because their whole house of cards was coming down.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:45.886]  And the fact that he was lying and saying they weren't putting nanotech in the vaccines, when the virus itself is nanotech, it's trackable.
[01:33:48.028 --> 01:33:49.409]  Not to mention the graphene oxide.
[01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:57.555]  And that, and I'm on record, when she filed, I said, this is being done because of Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:33:57.795 --> 01:33:59.817]  And they had news articles that attacked me last year.
[01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:10.077]  And I said, she's distancing herself, and they are splitting off the foundation, and they're putting... And so Dr. McCullough said this.
[01:34:11.399 --> 01:34:12.459]  Mercullough, not McCullough.
[01:34:13.180 --> 01:34:23.449]  His halo of being the angel and buying off the media and paying millions a year to control the press in medical news and to underwrite ABC News, NBC News, CNN, MSNBC, you name it.
[01:34:25.253 --> 01:34:26.597]  But they're moving the halo to her.
[01:34:26.838 --> 01:34:31.633]  But I said, if she comes out and actually attacks him and says Jeffrey Epstein is evil...
[01:34:32.861 --> 01:34:38.625]  When it says Jeffrey Epstein was a molester and says this is part of a satanic system, then she's not part of it.
[01:34:38.925 --> 01:34:47.632]  And we shouldn't say she's evil if she comes out fully and attacks Gates for being part of Epstein and admits that's part of the reason she left him.
[01:34:47.892 --> 01:34:49.953]  And she did it last week on CBS News.
[01:34:50.354 --> 01:34:52.695]  So people need to give her the benefit of the doubt.
[01:34:52.975 --> 01:34:55.497]  Because we've never gotten information that she's a eugenicist.
[01:34:55.958 --> 01:34:58.199]  We've never gotten information she's a child molester.
[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:00.961]  And she's now pulling her money.
[01:35:00.981 --> 01:35:01.702]  Here's the last part.
[01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:06.633]  Out of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and saying she's not going to fund it anymore.
[01:35:07.534 --> 01:35:09.515]  And instead wants to, quote, really educate women.
[01:35:09.776 --> 01:35:11.397]  Now, that remains to be seen.
[01:35:11.837 --> 01:35:17.142]  Steve Jobs' wife owns Atlantic Monthly and finances a tax on us and attempts to shut this show down.
[01:35:17.162 --> 01:35:17.662]  We know that.
[01:35:17.722 --> 01:35:18.543]  It's going to come out soon.
[01:35:19.584 --> 01:35:21.445]  And she goes to Epstein Island and she likes it.
[01:35:22.086 --> 01:35:23.307]  Hangs out with Ghislaine Maxwell.
[01:35:24.748 --> 01:35:28.591]  But we don't have Melinda French.
[01:35:30.242 --> 01:35:34.525]  And so, we need to give the other side a chance to defect back to goodness.
[01:35:35.166 --> 01:35:36.307]  To defect back to God.
[01:35:36.987 --> 01:35:43.573]  And not... When people decide to not be part of it, we need to give them a chance to at least prove themselves.
[01:35:47.196 --> 01:35:52.500]  Because, you know, Bill Gates is the type that would get a well-meaning woman to marry him as his front.
[01:35:53.761 --> 01:35:54.922]  Not for homosexual sex.
[01:35:55.222 --> 01:35:56.703]  We've never seen any evidence of that with Bill Gates.
[01:35:57.083 --> 01:35:57.524]  It's women.
[01:35:58.244 --> 01:35:58.905]  A lot of women.
[01:36:00.046 --> 01:36:08.833]  But the point is, is that she has discovered it looks like she was a beard for his political activities and his evil.
[01:36:09.774 --> 01:36:12.677]  And I'm sure his children aren't pure evil.
[01:36:15.779 --> 01:36:17.220]  A lot of people's children are different.
[01:36:17.281 --> 01:36:20.303]  So we don't see evidence of Bill Gates' children being evil.
[01:36:20.723 --> 01:36:26.929]  We don't see evidence of her being evil.
[01:36:27.029 --> 01:36:28.270]  She's been involved in evil.
[01:36:29.921 --> 01:36:35.426]  And now she's telling CBS News that Jeffrey Epstein is the most evil person she ever met.
[01:36:35.766 --> 01:36:37.387]  Wonder what she knows is coming out.
[01:36:37.547 --> 01:36:40.209]  Because she may be involved, she may be the worst person ever.
[01:36:40.530 --> 01:36:41.210]  Don't get me wrong.
[01:36:43.692 --> 01:36:47.856]  But I'm saying, you judge a tree by its fruits, she's going in the right direction.
[01:36:48.236 --> 01:36:50.578]  And I said, come out and denounce Epstein.
[01:36:50.898 --> 01:36:53.420]  Come out and denounce Bill getting involved with him.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:55.442]  Come out and denounce it and say it's evil.
[01:36:55.762 --> 01:36:57.143]  Let us see you're not evil.
[01:36:57.443 --> 01:36:58.164]  Let us see it.
[01:36:58.524 --> 01:36:59.145]  And here it is.
[01:37:01.604 --> 01:37:11.767]  You know, it was also widely reported that Bill had a friendship or business or some kind of contact with Jeffrey Epstein and that you were not, that that was very upsetting to you.
[01:37:11.827 --> 01:37:15.289]  Did that play a role in the divorce at all in this process?
[01:37:15.949 --> 01:37:19.650]  Yeah, as I said, it's not one thing, it was many things.
[01:37:20.170 --> 01:37:24.012]  But I did not like that he'd had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no.
[01:37:25.837 --> 01:37:27.018]  And you made that clear to him?
[01:37:27.779 --> 01:37:28.700]  I made that clear to him.
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.303]  I also met Jeffrey Epstein exactly one time.
[01:37:32.363 --> 01:37:32.823]  Did you?
[01:37:32.964 --> 01:37:40.410]  Yes, because I wanted to see who this man was and I regretted it from the second I stepped in the door.
[01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:41.872]  He was abhorrent.
[01:37:42.412 --> 01:37:45.012]  He was evil, personified.
[01:37:45.012 --> 01:37:46.972]  I had nightmares about it afterwards.
[01:37:46.972 --> 01:37:51.572]   So my heart breaks for these young women because that's how I felt.
[01:37:51.572 --> 01:37:52.811]  And here I'm an older woman.
[01:37:52.811 --> 01:37:55.212]  My God, I feel terrible for those young women.
[01:37:55.212 --> 01:37:56.212]  It was awful.
[01:37:56.212 --> 01:37:57.412]  You felt that the moment you walked in?
[01:37:57.412 --> 01:37:58.412]  I didn't realize it.
[01:37:58.412 --> 01:37:59.412]  It was awful.
[01:37:59.412 --> 01:38:00.412]  Yeah.
[01:38:00.412 --> 01:38:04.012]   And you shared that with Bill and he still continued to spend time with him?
[01:38:04.012 --> 01:38:08.692]   Any of the questions remaining about what Bill's relationship there was, those are for
[01:38:09.582 --> 01:38:10.023]  Okay.
[01:38:10.123 --> 01:38:12.263]  But I made it very clear how I felt about him.
[01:38:13.204 --> 01:38:17.906]  I think Bill Gates needs to answer for Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:38:21.527 --> 01:38:30.791]  We have to be very careful as the enemy starts to break apart to not run off people that are defecting.
[01:38:31.531 --> 01:38:32.732]  We need to bring them in.
[01:38:33.817 --> 01:38:35.018]  That's how we win, folks.
[01:38:35.698 --> 01:38:40.601]  Doesn't mean we trust Melinda Gates as far as we can throw her, but she's going in the right direction.
[01:38:42.742 --> 01:38:43.882]  Unbelievable.
[01:38:47.984 --> 01:38:49.505]  Okay, let's do this.
[01:38:49.945 --> 01:38:56.629]  I've been extremely... Well, let me finish up with the Bill Gates thing.
[01:38:58.430 --> 01:39:18.192]   This is a big deal that the main front man and also heavily involved the managerial systems of this unspeakable crime against humanity, the largest, most orchestrated Biological attack, chemical attack, nanotech attack ever executed on this planet by orders of magnitude.
[01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:21.575]  I mean, this is just spectacular science fiction nightmare stuff.
[01:39:21.996 --> 01:39:24.698]  The guy's got testicles the size of bowling balls.
[01:39:25.379 --> 01:39:25.659]  Okay?
[01:39:25.679 --> 01:39:33.747]  I mean, you're looking at a true psychotic master criminal that you're not going to see in movies.
[01:39:33.787 --> 01:39:35.929]  This is the real deal, along with him and Klaus Schwab.
[01:39:38.339 --> 01:39:41.362]  David Rockefeller and Prince Charles, I mean, just what a crew of scum.
[01:39:41.842 --> 01:39:50.589]  And the fact that he's their big front man and he's in so much trouble is a very, very good thing.
[01:39:51.170 --> 01:39:54.312]  And again, all glory goes to God, but God works through you.
[01:39:54.833 --> 01:40:00.037]  And so I want to just thank and commend all the listeners and viewers because you are the tip of the spear.
[01:40:00.117 --> 01:40:11.381]   You are the reason we have, let's not exaggerate, I mean, I have been credited face-to-face with most of the big names out there.
[01:40:12.561 --> 01:40:14.162]  Some of them in public, some of them in private meetings.
[01:40:14.202 --> 01:40:15.142]  They say, you woke me up.
[01:40:15.462 --> 01:40:16.802]  You're the reason we all know about this.
[01:40:17.182 --> 01:40:17.562]  Thank you.
[01:40:17.622 --> 01:40:18.443]  You're the trailblazer.
[01:40:18.463 --> 01:40:19.643]  You're the maverick, blah, blah, blah.
[01:40:20.103 --> 01:40:20.763]  You're a genius.
[01:40:20.823 --> 01:40:21.563]  And I go, no, I'm not.
[01:40:22.083 --> 01:40:27.525]  I just knew what the documents for you did, and now you know about it, and I believed in humanity, and this is happening.
[01:40:28.165 --> 01:40:31.505]  But if there is somebody that gets credit, it's you.
[01:40:32.646 --> 01:40:49.581]   When you told people about the show, When you prayed for the broadcast, when you shared the articles and the videos, when you bought product at Infowarsstore.com, you got us to the point where they've launched their global attacks and they're doing all this and it's horrible, but nothing they're doing is going well.
[01:40:51.144 --> 01:40:57.287]  It is blowing up in their face, in triplicate, and we got a real fighting chance at this.
[01:40:57.767 --> 01:41:05.711]  So I want to commend the listeners and viewers and this amazing crew out here, because without all of you, we would be in much worse straits right now.
[01:41:06.392 --> 01:41:09.493]  Yes, there's evil in the universe, but there's also a lot of good.
[01:41:09.533 --> 01:41:12.635]  So yes, let me do this before I hit the Russia News, or we won't be here.
[01:41:14.536 --> 01:41:16.597]  I'm in a Catch-22, and I've tried to explain this.
[01:41:18.278 --> 01:41:33.679]   We can sell Enough Wintersun and enough Rainforce Ultra and enough X2 and X3 to fund our operation and stay the same size and fight off the Democrat lawsuits and the harassment and the dirty tricks.
[01:41:34.299 --> 01:41:36.440]  If we could get these products in stock.
[01:41:39.181 --> 01:41:42.522]  But they're routinely sold out on average more than six months.
[01:41:43.482 --> 01:41:44.263]  And here's the catch-22.
[01:41:45.825 --> 01:41:48.948]  When I sell them at full price, we would be able to fund everything.
[01:41:48.988 --> 01:41:50.729]  In fact, I could probably do it at 25% off.
[01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:52.110]  We've done the math.
[01:41:52.251 --> 01:41:52.971]  25% off, barely.
[01:41:53.772 --> 01:41:59.357]  People are habituated where I always sell stuff at 30, 40, 50% off, so people wait till that happens.
[01:41:59.717 --> 01:42:03.720]  Then I sell out of it quicker, but don't make enough money back because there's not a lot of markup in these.
[01:42:06.322 --> 01:42:10.266]  And because it's such high quality stuff that's in them, I won't adulterate, I won't cut the quality.
[01:42:12.216 --> 01:42:15.579]  So a lot of our best brands are now not available anymore.
[01:42:15.619 --> 01:42:18.481]  We have to discontinue because you just can't get the products anymore.
[01:42:18.781 --> 01:42:23.005]  The products we can get, the price has gone up, the supply chain's broken down.
[01:42:23.385 --> 01:42:24.566]  I don't want to go up in price.
[01:42:25.206 --> 01:42:27.628]  And if I discount it, people buy it.
[01:42:27.688 --> 01:42:29.490]  If I don't discount it, people don't buy it.
[01:42:30.651 --> 01:42:35.234]  So like two weeks ago, I go, well, I'm going to stop offering stuff at 50% off.
[01:42:38.183 --> 01:42:46.445]  But then I talk to the accountant and they go, well, you really need to move all this at 50% off just to be able to get money in to be able to buy more if it's coming in in 15, 20 weeks.
[01:42:49.626 --> 01:42:54.547]  And so we're doing this math and stuff trying to figure out what we do.
[01:42:55.827 --> 01:42:57.628]  So I'm going to tell you, I'm just going to make the decision right now.
[01:42:58.568 --> 01:43:06.490]  We're going to sell down to just a few thousand bottles of each or a few hundred bottles of each of all these products.
[01:43:06.650 --> 01:43:11.126]   And then henceforth, The biggest sale we're gonna do on these is 25% off.
[01:43:11.526 --> 01:43:19.129]  Because again, supply chain breakdown, all of it, and cost of goods going up, we cannot discount at 40 or 50% off anymore.
[01:43:20.650 --> 01:43:22.911]  And so we got a bodies flash sale, 50% off.
[01:43:23.511 --> 01:43:26.353]  Survival Shield X3 is gonna sell out in a month at 50% off.
[01:43:26.633 --> 01:43:28.313]  I need the money, doesn't matter, it's 50% off.
[01:43:28.614 --> 01:43:29.754]  Winter Sun, 50% off.
[01:43:31.715 --> 01:43:38.820]   And the best selling, RainForce Ultra Nootropic, Beyond the brain pills you find out there.
[01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:39.860]  Next level.
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:41.561]  It's 40% off.
[01:43:44.362 --> 01:43:44.802]  Got info?
[01:43:44.842 --> 01:43:46.883]  Workstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:43:47.443 --> 01:43:57.567]  I want to thank you all for your support and get a book, get a film, get a t-shirt, get a water filtration, get an air filtration.
[01:43:58.528 --> 01:43:59.228]  Whatever you do.
[01:44:01.689 --> 01:44:02.669]  Support the transmission.
[01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:06.271]  Because I was on the phone today.
[01:44:09.929 --> 01:44:16.774]  With all the stuff going on and the sharks circling this place and the desperate orders coming down from on high of getting him to shut up.
[01:44:19.356 --> 01:44:19.516]  And.
[01:44:21.957 --> 01:44:22.718]  I'm not going to shut up.
[01:44:24.093 --> 01:44:29.978]  In fact, people trying to buy me off or people threatening me with jail or stuff like that only makes me more angry.
[01:44:29.998 --> 01:44:30.739]  I want to fight harder.
[01:44:31.299 --> 01:44:33.681]  But I can give out, as I've explained.
[01:44:34.182 --> 01:44:42.189]  And quite frankly, I know I'm not bitching, I spend now 30-40% of my time trying to get products to be able to sell and keep us on air.
[01:44:43.390 --> 01:44:54.001]   And so, I'm finally going to get to the point where I am going to reach out to folks that I know have money, that I know are listeners and say, We're in the endgame here.
[01:44:54.221 --> 01:44:55.582]  How about you give me some money?
[01:44:56.322 --> 01:45:03.643]  Because I know you're giving big Republicans money, and I know you're giving all these other groups money, and I don't know where you're going to find a place that will spend the money in a better way.
[01:45:04.804 --> 01:45:06.564]  I mean, it's that simple, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:07.544 --> 01:45:08.745]  We need funds, but it doesn't matter.
[01:45:09.125 --> 01:45:10.265]  We're backed by listeners.
[01:45:10.405 --> 01:45:11.325]  We're backed by viewers.
[01:45:11.345 --> 01:45:13.006]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:45:13.566 --> 01:45:14.746]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:45:16.548 --> 01:45:17.769]  Or 888-253-3139.
[01:45:17.789 --> 01:45:21.311]  And I just want to thank you all because you really have changed the world.
[01:45:21.351 --> 01:45:22.932]  And that's why I just keep repeating that.
[01:45:22.952 --> 01:45:26.154]  I mean, do you realize, as listeners and viewers, what you've done?
[01:45:27.415 --> 01:45:30.177]  And that if it wasn't for you, how much trouble we're in?
[01:45:30.417 --> 01:45:32.158]  And I understand you don't want praise.
[01:45:32.238 --> 01:45:33.259]  You don't care about that.
[01:45:33.499 --> 01:45:34.179]  You're just like me.
[01:45:34.259 --> 01:45:37.001]  But you need to also understand how important you are.
[01:45:37.321 --> 01:45:43.665]  That's why, you know, I knew years ago that we'd influenced most of the Big Awakening, the show, our guests, the listeners, all of us together.
[01:45:44.366 --> 01:45:44.806]  I knew that.
[01:45:46.578 --> 01:45:53.123]  But I didn't want to go on air and tell people that type of stuff just because it sounds arrogant.
[01:45:53.443 --> 01:45:57.046]  But I know folks out there are smart enough to understand that this is not arrogance.
[01:45:58.287 --> 01:45:58.967]  It's the opposite.
[01:45:58.987 --> 01:46:02.270]  This is a very dangerous situation we're in.
[01:46:03.330 --> 01:46:06.293]  And we're doing a very dangerous procedure here to expose these people.
[01:46:07.053 --> 01:46:09.275]  And I just feel like I haven't done the best job I could.
[01:46:09.295 --> 01:46:14.739]  And I'm sorry that I have had a lot of problems and I've fallen down and had issues.
[01:46:16.909 --> 01:46:21.431]  God works in mysterious ways and we've just come a long way together, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:22.931 --> 01:46:33.816]  And there are a lot of children out there in bondage and slavery and a lot of innocent people getting hurt that are praying to God tonight that God save them and God help them.
[01:46:33.856 --> 01:46:39.418]  And God is going to work through us to save those people.
[01:46:40.998 --> 01:46:44.800]  And if we don't do it, nobody's going to do it for them.
[01:46:45.819 --> 01:47:07.187]  And God hears their cries, and God works through us that are strong to stand up so that the people out there, the widows and the widowers and all these parents that have lost their teenage sons and daughters from these injections, and all the people that these globalists have selfishly tortured and killed, and all the crimes they've committed.
[01:47:10.308 --> 01:47:14.530]  God has sent all of us to deliver these people.
[01:47:18.772 --> 01:47:19.372]  So we got to do it.
[01:47:20.213 --> 01:47:23.194]  And that means you got to really do it, folks.
[01:47:24.335 --> 01:47:30.057]  And you're not going to get directives from me about what you should do, because I don't know your skills.
[01:47:30.478 --> 01:47:31.338]  I don't know where you are.
[01:47:31.358 --> 01:47:33.579]  I know, though, the Holy Spirit's real.
[01:47:33.699 --> 01:47:43.904]  And if you'll just ask God to come into you and to begin to direct you, God will only do with you what God thinks you're ready to do.
[01:47:44.564 --> 01:47:56.662]   But if you believe in God, What you're able to do will snowball and it will really change the world.
[01:47:56.702 --> 01:48:12.092]  And I know there are people listening right now that in the fullness of time are going to do things greater than what I've done and greater than what many other people have done.
[01:48:12.452 --> 01:48:24.025]   Because the time's coming when the world's going to be so chaotic and so crazy and moving so fast That you'll be in a whole new world.
[01:48:26.586 --> 01:48:27.607]  I want you to be ready for that.
[01:48:28.888 --> 01:48:32.291]  I want you to know you can't navigate this without God.
[01:48:32.671 --> 01:48:33.912]  I'm gonna stop preaching at that point.
[01:48:34.432 --> 01:48:37.975]  All right, let me, we'll go a little bit to the next hour.
[01:48:39.136 --> 01:48:46.736]   And when this live transmission is over, we will start looping here.
[01:48:46.736 --> 01:49:01.936]   And then, I hope people will share the live feed of the show right now.
[01:49:02.161 --> 01:49:08.465]  And I hope that you will share the archive of this once it's posted on Bandai Video.
[01:49:10.526 --> 01:49:13.588]  All right, let me do my best job here.
[01:49:16.490 --> 01:49:21.434]  Resetting here and getting into this whole situation with Russia.
[01:49:24.156 --> 01:49:28.814]   And I think the best way to start Really diving into the big developments is this.
[01:49:29.955 --> 01:49:36.097]  We need to stop thinking about what's happening like we're in a football game.
[01:49:37.938 --> 01:49:42.980]  And Putin's the good guy, or Putin's the bad guy.
[01:49:46.942 --> 01:49:51.364]  Or America's the good guy, or America is the bad guy.
[01:49:54.398 --> 01:49:55.999]  Russia has its interest.
[01:49:56.299 --> 01:49:57.599]  We have our interest.
[01:49:59.060 --> 01:50:05.903]  The people running our country and running most of the world do not have humanity's best interest at heart.
[01:50:07.063 --> 01:50:08.964]  They want a post-human world.
[01:50:10.405 --> 01:50:13.006]  Now, Putin says he recognizes that and is fighting it.
[01:50:13.446 --> 01:50:16.367]  And he says he doesn't want to be part of the New World Order.
[01:50:16.787 --> 01:50:17.908]  I don't know if that's true.
[01:50:19.622 --> 01:50:48.698]   What I know is that George Soros brags that he was the front man for the CIA and the State Department that paid $5 billion to overthrow the elected government of Ukraine eight years ago and firebomb and kill hundreds and hundreds of police and thousands of soldiers To overthrow the government and then ship weapons in there and start a war on the border with Russia.
[01:50:49.158 --> 01:50:54.619]  And I know that because he went on Fareed Zarkaria's show on CNN and said it.
[01:50:55.340 --> 01:51:05.323]  And he also told C-SPAN viewers that in 2015, he said, it's George Soros's empire.
[01:51:05.843 --> 01:51:07.364]  I control Eastern Europe.
[01:51:09.384 --> 01:51:11.225]  And I'm going to overthrow Vladimir Putin.
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:20.822]  Now there are groups above Soros using him to manipulate and poke Putin into this.
[01:51:20.862 --> 01:51:22.143]  And I think Putin made a mistake.
[01:51:23.423 --> 01:51:24.723]  I was against all these wars.
[01:51:27.024 --> 01:51:29.585]  I was against the civil war and trying to overthrow Assad.
[01:51:29.825 --> 01:51:30.805]  Not because I like Assad.
[01:51:33.246 --> 01:51:35.827]  I've been consistently anti-offensive war.
[01:51:36.467 --> 01:51:40.068]  And I understand that the West manipulated Russia into this.
[01:51:40.088 --> 01:51:42.089]  I understand Putin has his reasons.
[01:51:43.996 --> 01:51:50.781]  And Putin, as I said weeks ago, if he did actually go into the full country, is entering a bear trap.
[01:51:51.522 --> 01:51:52.122]  Pun intended.
[01:51:56.805 --> 01:52:02.370]  And obviously they're going to use this to censor anybody that even shows all the sides.
[01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:09.555]  And that's what we do, is you'll see what the establishment's saying, what the Russians are saying, what the people are saying.
[01:52:10.973 --> 01:52:13.895]  And the system is battling to take us off air.
[01:52:13.975 --> 01:52:19.819]  All over the news, they're pro-Putin because they don't want airstrikes on the convoy.
[01:52:20.599 --> 01:52:25.742]  Alex Jones is pro-Putin because he points out that Russia had security issues.
[01:52:27.103 --> 01:52:48.054]   I'm actually trying to inform the public of why we're in this situation so we can have diplomacy and detente instead of Collapsing civilization, which the globalists want to use this as the smokescreen for the financial collapse and the launch of the COVID takeover, which they now admit they've done.
[01:52:50.816 --> 01:52:56.579]  Years ago, before they indicted Roger Stone, I made jokes about them saying we were Russian agents.
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:52:59.260]  There's one of those jokes from years ago.
[01:52:59.501 --> 01:53:00.361]  We'll play that coming up.
[01:53:01.722 --> 01:53:03.643]  But I'll tell you, I don't think it's funny now.
[01:53:07.597 --> 01:53:14.362]  I was going to go to Russia four years ago and do interviews and live feeds and get massive viewers and pull a stunt.
[01:53:15.843 --> 01:53:18.986]  And when I put out my passport on Twitter, they said, look, he's a Russian agent.
[01:53:19.306 --> 01:53:22.869]  And they had Democrats up on the Hill say, we should investigate Alex Jones.
[01:53:22.889 --> 01:53:26.091]  He's got a Russian visa, which anybody could get if you're in the media.
[01:53:26.111 --> 01:53:26.692]  I want to go over there.
[01:53:28.851 --> 01:53:39.602]  They called Tucker Carlson a Russian agent for wanting an interview with Vladimir Putin, but everybody else can interview Vladimir Putin from the New York Times or CNN, but he can't at Fox News.
[01:53:39.982 --> 01:53:58.014]   It's how they handicap everybody, where you can't even By the way, I had the Russian media, through RT, we sent them emails saying, yes, if you want to fly to these mountains, maybe on this date, he'll have a press junket and you might get one question in while he's hunting.
[01:53:58.214 --> 01:53:59.355]  We weren't going to go interview Putin.
[01:53:59.515 --> 01:54:02.036]  I'm not going to go do that to maybe get one question into Putin.
[01:54:03.457 --> 01:54:09.481]  I'm sure it'd be some cool mountain in the Urals while he's hunting God knows what, but no, I didn't go to that.
[01:54:10.365 --> 01:54:12.746]  But I didn't want to go to Russia to be a Russian agent.
[01:54:12.786 --> 01:54:15.068]  I wanted to go to Russia because I want to go to Egypt.
[01:54:15.148 --> 01:54:15.968]  I want to go to Israel.
[01:54:16.208 --> 01:54:17.149]  I want to go to Japan.
[01:54:17.749 --> 01:54:18.930]  I want to go to Easter Island.
[01:54:20.130 --> 01:54:21.191]  I want to go to Alaska.
[01:54:21.431 --> 01:54:22.611]  I've never been to Alaska.
[01:54:24.693 --> 01:54:25.393]  Not in Eskimo.
[01:54:26.353 --> 01:54:27.694]  And everybody knows that.
[01:54:28.074 --> 01:54:30.496]  And the left hears that and goes, oh, Jones is covering.
[01:54:30.736 --> 01:54:31.456]  Jones is scared.
[01:54:31.976 --> 01:54:35.598]  Because they take everything and twist it like it's to an advantage or something.
[01:54:36.138 --> 01:54:36.899]  It's mental illness.
[01:54:39.631 --> 01:54:44.896]  Absolute, beyond anything Joseph McCarthy ever imagined.
[01:54:44.976 --> 01:54:49.120]  And they're doing it, and they're calling it good, and saying it's something good they're doing.
[01:54:51.002 --> 01:55:02.470]   So, the assault on asking questions, the assault on really wanting to cover things, And you see Russia censoring now.
[01:55:03.290 --> 01:55:04.391]  And now the West censoring.
[01:55:04.911 --> 01:55:06.171]  It's wrong when Russia does it.
[01:55:06.992 --> 01:55:07.912]  It's wrong when the U.S.
[01:55:07.952 --> 01:55:08.312]  does it.
[01:55:08.452 --> 01:55:09.072]  It's wrong.
[01:55:09.553 --> 01:55:11.753]  We're the country that's the example of free speech.
[01:55:13.634 --> 01:55:15.915]  You know, Communist China censors.
[01:55:18.476 --> 01:55:19.957]  And that's supposedly okay.
[01:55:21.777 --> 01:55:23.938]  Our media's like, well, we can censor now, too.
[01:55:24.218 --> 01:55:24.918]  They're censoring.
[01:55:25.219 --> 01:55:26.539]  Oh, look, the Russians are censoring.
[01:55:26.739 --> 01:55:28.500]  Here, let's censor more.
[01:55:32.588 --> 01:55:36.792]  We're supposed to be the people.
[01:55:38.794 --> 01:55:40.396]  We're supposed to be the group.
[01:55:41.677 --> 01:55:43.118]  That's the example of freedom.
[01:55:43.459 --> 01:55:45.641]  Not, oh, everybody else has taken freedom.
[01:55:45.981 --> 01:55:47.402]  Oh, Germany's banning free speech.
[01:55:47.803 --> 01:55:49.384]  Oh, Austria's got forced injections.
[01:55:49.805 --> 01:55:52.487]  Oh, you can't leave your house if you haven't taken the shot in Australia.
[01:55:52.507 --> 01:55:54.049]  We need to be like that here!
[01:55:57.650 --> 01:56:04.550]   And all these formerly free Western countries became an example of tyranny to the world with the COVID biomedical
[01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:05.250]  garbage.
[01:56:05.250 --> 01:56:12.050]  I'm for peace.
[01:56:12.050 --> 01:56:22.050]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:56:14.119 --> 01:56:21.884]  And what I see out of Ukraine, now that Russia has invaded, is not good.
[01:56:22.344 --> 01:56:26.326]  Ukraine has lied about the nuclear reactor saying they shelled it and it was going to melt down.
[01:56:26.346 --> 01:56:27.027]  None of that was true.
[01:56:28.387 --> 01:56:30.108]  There was no leak, no extra radiation.
[01:56:30.888 --> 01:56:32.709]  The Snake Island massacre didn't happen.
[01:56:33.449 --> 01:56:35.310]  The ghost of Kiev, it was all made up.
[01:56:36.191 --> 01:56:40.112]  And almost everything coming out of Zelensky's mouth is a lie.
[01:56:43.114 --> 01:56:45.075]  Now, I don't say that because I'm pro-Putin.
[01:56:45.475 --> 01:56:47.576]  I say that because I'm pro-truth.
[01:56:50.259 --> 01:56:51.420]  I said this a week ago.
[01:56:51.480 --> 01:57:06.149]  I said, looks like Putin's putting in his junior varsity, his conscripts, because they have a draft over there, using them as human targets to pull out the identities and emplacements for special forces of where the Ukrainian troops are so they can kill them.
[01:57:06.630 --> 01:57:07.850]  And indeed, that's what happened.
[01:57:08.351 --> 01:57:15.135]  That's a nasty tactic by Putin, sending in his greenest troops.
[01:57:16.656 --> 01:57:18.017]  But it's a desperate tactic.
[01:57:19.278 --> 01:57:24.710]  The Soviets would do that, and with the Nazis, is they would sit in people where only one half the folks even had a rifle.
[01:57:25.511 --> 01:57:27.977]  And when one person got killed, you'd pick up the other man's rifle.
[01:57:29.898 --> 01:57:32.599]  So it's a desperate tactic, and it just shows where we are.
[01:57:32.619 --> 01:57:39.261]  And now you see Sean Hannity saying, let's bomb Russia, or bomb the convoy, and you've got all these Democrats saying it.
[01:57:39.861 --> 01:57:54.505]  And it's just extremely insane to have a bunch of people on The View, a bunch of women that couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper bag, probably can't even find their ass with both hands, all talking about the war they want.
[01:57:58.891 --> 01:58:03.133]  And so I don't want to be like the corporate media that says somebody said something and then not show it.
[01:58:03.533 --> 01:58:05.874]  Let's play a new clip that I hadn't seen until now.
[01:58:06.455 --> 01:58:29.906]   I'd read the writings of his foundation saying it, and Fiona Hill, but I'd never seen him say it, where he brags and calls Eastern Europe and the Caucasus and the Slavic nations that border Russia, his former Nazi happy hunting ground, where he helped round folks up with the Nazis, literally, He calls it the Soros Empire.
[01:58:29.967 --> 01:58:30.967]  Here it is.
[01:58:30.967 --> 01:58:31.967]  [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[01:58:31.967 --> 01:58:32.967]   When the Soviet Union-- the Soviet empire collapsed. And as the empire collapsed, I'm
[01:58:32.967 --> 01:58:33.967]   not sure if the Soviet Union was able to survive. And I think that the Soviet Union was able
[01:58:33.967 --> 01:58:34.967]  to survive.
[01:58:34.967 --> 01:58:35.967]  I think that the Soviet Union was able to survive.
[01:58:35.967 --> 01:58:36.967]  I think that the Soviet Union was able to survive.
[01:58:36.967 --> 01:58:37.967]  I think that the Soviet Union was able to survive.
[01:58:37.967 --> 01:58:38.967]  I think that the Soviet Union was able to survive.
[01:58:38.967 --> 01:58:39.967]  I think that the Soviet Union was able to survive.
[01:58:39.967 --> 01:58:40.967]  I think that the Soviet Union was able to survive.
[01:58:40.967 --> 01:58:41.967]  I think that the Soviet Union was able to survive.
[01:58:41.967 --> 01:58:42.967]  I think that the Soviet Union was able to survive.
[01:58:42.967 --> 01:58:43.967]  I think that the Soviet Union was able to survive.
[01:58:44.229 --> 01:58:47.810]  I moved in and picked up the pieces.
[01:58:48.711 --> 01:58:50.451]  First in Hungary in 1984.
[01:58:50.611 --> 01:58:56.054]  And then Poland in 87.
[01:58:56.554 --> 01:58:58.355]  China in 87 as well.
[01:59:00.056 --> 01:59:07.219]  And so this is how the, this, what I'm, the Soros Empire.
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:12.121]  Replacing the Soviet Empire.
[01:59:14.221 --> 01:59:17.143]  And how do you think you're doing in your imperial ambitions?
[01:59:19.824 --> 01:59:22.025]  So, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:59:23.886 --> 01:59:24.406]  There you go.
[01:59:24.466 --> 01:59:27.367]  Let's play that clip one more time.
[01:59:28.448 --> 01:59:32.650]  Just so everybody gets it very clear and has it on record so you can share it, get it out there to folks.
[01:59:32.690 --> 01:59:33.070]  Here it is.
[01:59:34.171 --> 01:59:46.803]   When the Soviet Union, the Soviet Empire collapsed, and as the empire Collapsed, I moved in and picked up the pieces.
[01:59:47.703 --> 01:59:57.346]  First in Hungary in 1984, and then Poland in 87, China in 87 as well.
[01:59:59.066 --> 02:00:11.110]  And so this is how this, the Soros Empire, replacing the Soviet Empire.
[02:00:13.209 --> 02:00:16.150]  And how do you think you're doing in your imperial ambitions?
[02:00:17.791 --> 02:00:21.472]  Okay, so that's the Asia Society on C-SPAN.
[02:00:23.813 --> 02:00:24.993]  And he means it.
[02:00:25.133 --> 02:00:26.333]  And he has a list of things.
[02:00:26.393 --> 02:00:28.194]  Transgenderism to sterilize the boys.
[02:00:28.674 --> 02:00:29.614]  Fluoride in the water.
[02:00:30.115 --> 02:00:31.795]  Weaponized marijuana on the streets.
[02:00:32.715 --> 02:00:33.816]  Drug legalization.
[02:00:33.836 --> 02:00:36.016]  Not because he wants to help people.
[02:00:37.137 --> 02:00:39.637]  Because I think we should decriminalize drugs.
[02:00:40.338 --> 02:00:41.478]  We should not legalize them.
[02:00:42.691 --> 02:00:45.053]  Don't put people in prison for being on heroin or cocaine.
[02:00:48.475 --> 02:00:51.817]  But don't legalize it so people get addicted to it.
[02:00:52.797 --> 02:00:56.039]  You just penalize the dealers.
[02:00:56.460 --> 02:00:58.921]  You don't penalize the users.
[02:00:59.362 --> 02:01:04.565]  But now Soros wants it all legalized, so you're so blown and blasted out of your brain, you don't know who you are.
[02:01:04.665 --> 02:01:09.328]  So, the Russians and everybody sees what he's doing.
[02:01:12.648 --> 02:01:13.629]  And they're upset about it.
[02:01:14.069 --> 02:01:25.696]  And then if you talk about Soros and say, Soros admits he's funding all the different migrant groups coming into Latin America and into Europe, and he's paying with U.S.
[02:01:25.736 --> 02:01:35.182]  taxpayer money to the State Department, but they give him the money to launder it, these debit cards with $1,000 to $3,000 or euros on them, so they can come to the U.S.
[02:01:35.242 --> 02:01:42.382]   or Europe, They'll demonize you and attack you, but then you can go to videos of him saying it, or go to Reuters articles with him bragging about it.
[02:01:42.762 --> 02:01:44.283]  So again, he's off limits.
[02:01:45.244 --> 02:01:47.826]  You're not supposed to talk about the Emperor.
[02:01:52.128 --> 02:01:52.689]  It's amazing.
[02:01:53.369 --> 02:02:03.056]  And he's put thousands of DAs and more than 20 Attorney Generals in power.
[02:02:05.993 --> 02:02:12.357]  And if you're a conservative and you've had two beers, you're getting the book thrown at you for DWI.
[02:02:12.817 --> 02:02:14.258]  You're going to go to prison for a couple of years.
[02:02:15.239 --> 02:02:19.321]  But if you are a Black Lives Matter person that shoots five people and kills them, you're out in a week.
[02:02:22.183 --> 02:02:27.026]  That's a criminal that has nothing but just psychotic hate for everyone.
[02:02:27.286 --> 02:02:29.447]  And he hates Christians and he hates America.
[02:02:31.889 --> 02:02:40.789]   Here he is bragging with the Bilderberg group minion, Fareed Zarkaria, About how he overthrew Ukraine.
[02:02:40.809 --> 02:02:41.189]  Here it is.
[02:02:42.789 --> 02:02:56.636]  One of the things that many people recognized about you was that you, during the revolutions of 1989, funded a lot of dissident activity, civil society groups in Eastern Europe, in Poland, the Czech Republic.
[02:02:57.316 --> 02:02:59.177]  Are you doing similar things in Ukraine?
[02:02:59.637 --> 02:03:07.262]  Well, I set up a foundation in Ukraine before Ukraine became independent of Russia.
[02:03:08.523 --> 02:03:12.365]  And the foundation has been functioning ever since.
[02:03:13.046 --> 02:03:16.728]  And it played an important part in events now.
[02:03:17.028 --> 02:03:25.450]  Do you think Ukraine will be able to assert a kind of independence from Russia and an alignment with the West?
[02:03:25.590 --> 02:03:31.231]  Not a specific alignment as a NATO, but a kind of orientation toward the West, or will the Russians always stop them?
[02:03:31.531 --> 02:03:33.031]  No.
[02:03:33.091 --> 02:03:41.610]   Putin will try to destabilize Ukraine, but the Ukrainians, the large majority of Ukrainians
[02:03:41.610 --> 02:03:45.131]  are determined to be independent of Russia.
[02:03:45.131 --> 02:03:56.650]   It won't be easy, because Putin has staked his regime on destabilizing Ukraine, because
[02:03:56.650 --> 02:04:00.651]  it's a threat to his regime in Russia.
[02:04:00.458 --> 02:04:08.377]   Russia. If you have freedom, free media and so on, and a flourishing economy, that
[02:04:08.377 --> 02:04:17.728]  would make his regime unsustainable. Okay, so he's invaded.
[02:04:17.728 --> 02:04:23.157]   He says he'll go to war with any country that's involved in a no-fly zone. Germany
[02:04:23.157 --> 02:04:27.878]   has come out, the Chancellor, and said, "Okay, we're not going to support
[02:04:27.878 --> 02:04:28.858]  Ukraine entering NATO,"
[02:04:28.858 --> 02:04:30.458]  which was very close to happening.
[02:04:30.627 --> 02:04:32.868]  So he's already getting one of his major demands.
[02:04:34.228 --> 02:04:41.032]  The danger is Putin has designs on other parts of Eastern Europe as well that NATO has moved into.
[02:04:41.052 --> 02:04:46.114]  And it was a very dangerous gamble.
[02:04:49.355 --> 02:04:53.257]  And that's why I don't support any of these expansionist wars.
[02:04:53.857 --> 02:04:56.138]  I understand they set up a war on his doorstep.
[02:04:56.198 --> 02:04:57.059]  I understand all that.
[02:04:57.939 --> 02:05:01.441]  But it's just going to hurt the people of the world.
[02:05:01.461 --> 02:05:04.943]  It's going to kill tens of thousands of troops and civilians on each side.
[02:05:04.983 --> 02:05:07.564]  I mean, look at this footage of a service-to-air missile.
[02:05:07.584 --> 02:05:13.207]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see it shooting down a Russian armored helicopter.
[02:05:13.907 --> 02:05:17.249]  Just extremely, extremely dramatic footage there.
[02:05:19.557 --> 02:05:27.264]  Let's go into some more of this information that's very important.
[02:05:29.146 --> 02:05:32.489]  Let's go to clip 18.
[02:05:33.890 --> 02:05:37.533]  Putin warns the no-fly zone over Ukraine will be an act of war.
[02:05:38.774 --> 02:05:39.114]  Here it is.
[02:05:42.373 --> 02:05:48.055]  We need to create a no-fly zone on the territory of Ukraine.
[02:05:48.115 --> 02:05:56.219]  It is impossible to do this on the territory of Ukraine itself.
[02:05:56.259 --> 02:06:00.200]  It is possible only on the territory of some neighboring states.
[02:06:00.220 --> 02:06:10.965]  But any movement in this direction will be considered by us as participation in the armed conflict of the country from the territory that will create threats for our servicemen.
[02:06:12.455 --> 02:06:17.059]  We will consider them at the same time as participants in the military conflict.
[02:06:17.099 --> 02:06:20.723]  And it doesn't matter what members they are.
[02:06:20.743 --> 02:06:23.645]  What is denazification?
[02:06:23.665 --> 02:06:25.147]  I'm talking to my Western colleagues.
[02:06:25.347 --> 02:06:25.767]  Why is that?
[02:06:25.807 --> 02:06:26.708]  You also have radicals.
[02:06:26.728 --> 02:06:27.108]  Yes, we do.
[02:06:27.148 --> 02:06:29.430]  But we don't have radicals in the government.
[02:06:31.252 --> 02:06:32.232]  And everyone admits that there is.
[02:06:32.252 --> 02:06:35.954]  Yes, maybe we have some assholes who are running around with swastikas.
[02:06:36.214 --> 02:06:39.496]  But do we support this at the government level?
[02:06:39.536 --> 02:06:46.839]  Do we have thousands of people walking around the capitals with torches in Moscow or in our other regional capitals?
[02:06:48.732 --> 02:06:50.853]  Potent sanctions are a declaration of war.
[02:06:51.374 --> 02:07:01.720]  No-fly zone warning weighs cyberattacks as the West engages in cyberattacks against Russia, saying that it's an act of war if Russia launches any cyberattacks back.
[02:07:03.481 --> 02:07:05.141]  Very, very dangerous situation.
[02:07:05.962 --> 02:07:13.026]  You know, we aired this piece more than four years ago, back when Trump was first in office.
[02:07:13.046 --> 02:07:14.487]  They were calling us all Russian agents.
[02:07:15.748 --> 02:07:20.353]  There's a restaurant downtown Austin that's Russian and Eastern European flair.
[02:07:21.194 --> 02:07:22.475]  What's the name of that restaurant?
[02:07:23.156 --> 02:07:23.757]  Russia House.
[02:07:24.617 --> 02:07:29.663]  And they've got a cloakroom with Russian outfits and things.
[02:07:29.743 --> 02:07:31.345]  It's a joke, you know, you can wear.
[02:07:31.385 --> 02:07:33.247]  It's like a theme party place.
[02:07:33.267 --> 02:07:34.428]  They've got pretty good food, actually.
[02:07:34.608 --> 02:07:35.329]  Hadn't been there in years.
[02:07:37.017 --> 02:07:45.441]  So we had an office party there, and you can see some of the ladies that work here, and we just did a little impromptu.
[02:07:45.481 --> 02:07:48.662]  I set my camera on the table, my phone, and I said, OK.
[02:07:48.682 --> 02:07:49.543]  We had one take.
[02:07:49.603 --> 02:07:51.584]  It was pretty funny there.
[02:07:52.464 --> 02:07:56.826]  But the media picked this up and said, look, he's a Russian, thinking their viewers are so dumb.
[02:07:57.226 --> 02:08:02.329]  And the Russians were insulted by it and said, look at Jones making fun of us to air it on national Russian TV.
[02:08:02.349 --> 02:08:04.750]  But I think the Russians have a sense of humor.
[02:08:06.547 --> 02:08:11.381]  We're first going to air a really funny clip of Russians train with a bear.
[02:08:12.190 --> 02:08:15.932]  And it's really funny, the bear is like shaking the tree while the guy bounces up and down on it.
[02:08:15.952 --> 02:08:21.335]  Because the Russians are known for taking both grizzly bears and other bears, a couple of species.
[02:08:21.355 --> 02:08:22.095]  This is a grizzly bear.
[02:08:22.755 --> 02:08:23.296]  As pets!
[02:08:24.556 --> 02:08:27.458]  And so they've got one as a pet that's playing with the soldiers.
[02:08:28.498 --> 02:08:33.321]  And folks were joking that this is Alex Jones in Rocky IV.
[02:08:33.341 --> 02:08:34.301]  That was what the tweet said.
[02:08:34.781 --> 02:08:37.323]  So here is the Russian trains with a bear behind him.
[02:08:37.603 --> 02:08:38.603]  A little bit of comic relief.
[02:08:38.943 --> 02:08:40.144]  And then we'll play the next clip.
[02:08:40.003 --> 02:09:08.323]  Alex Jones is not a Russian agent.
[02:09:08.666 --> 02:09:15.090]  We pledge this plan to destroy the Americans, to save their economy, and their people, and their border, and their military.
[02:09:15.450 --> 02:09:16.211]  Hail Putin!
[02:09:16.391 --> 02:09:17.191]  Hail Russia!
[02:09:17.372 --> 02:09:19.813]  We will never surrender!
[02:09:21.094 --> 02:09:22.675]  Yes!
[02:09:23.275 --> 02:09:23.556]  Yes!
[02:09:23.676 --> 02:09:25.157]  That is the KGB plan!
[02:09:25.717 --> 02:09:26.398]  Ha ha ha!
[02:09:26.418 --> 02:09:27.378]  Well done, Comrade!
[02:09:27.418 --> 02:09:29.720]  We're selling Americans!
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:30.520]  Ha ha ha!
[02:09:35.044 --> 02:09:39.367]  And the one guy was like a waiter in one of the fur hats.
[02:09:39.727 --> 02:09:40.948]  We sucked him into it.
[02:09:41.348 --> 02:09:44.451]  And people are like online going, I'm telling you, that's a Russian.
[02:09:45.492 --> 02:09:48.374]  No, the woman in black actually was a Russian for real.
[02:09:48.754 --> 02:09:50.075]  Oh my God, they know a Russian.
[02:09:50.736 --> 02:09:52.837]  We're all in big trouble now.
[02:09:52.877 --> 02:09:54.919]  Look, he's got a red star on his hat as well.
[02:09:55.677 --> 02:09:56.698]  So that was a lot of fun.
[02:09:57.238 --> 02:10:05.483]  We did some other joke pieces, and then I learned it's not a joke, because the left actually shows this stuff and tells their viewers, look, he's wearing a fur hat.
[02:10:08.224 --> 02:10:11.626]  It's like when Saki wore a fur hat, a Russian fur hat.
[02:10:11.927 --> 02:10:13.167]  People said, she must be a Russian agent.
[02:10:13.608 --> 02:10:14.608]  Only if we were so lucky.
[02:10:14.628 --> 02:10:17.490]  She's actually a satanic New World Order agent.
[02:10:17.510 --> 02:10:18.591]  But let's get serious here.
[02:10:20.252 --> 02:10:23.131]   Let's get very, very serious here because a lot of things need to be gotten to.
[02:10:23.131 --> 02:10:31.372]   I'm not going to get into the Trevor Noah thing just because it's important.
[02:10:31.540 --> 02:10:32.441]  I don't have time to get to it.
[02:10:33.161 --> 02:10:36.283]  Let's play clip 9, Russell Brand.
[02:10:36.343 --> 02:10:43.347]  Man, he is reaching 4 or 5 million people per video he does on YouTube alone, and he's really got it.
[02:10:43.427 --> 02:10:46.589]  I know he was a listener 15 years ago when he was married to Katy Perry.
[02:10:48.015 --> 02:10:48.855]  I know he's been on the show.
[02:10:48.895 --> 02:10:51.856]  We've hung out before, but I can't get through to Russell Brand.
[02:10:51.896 --> 02:10:54.938]  He says nice things about me on air, too, but we try to hit him on Twitter.
[02:10:54.958 --> 02:10:56.418]  We try to hit him through his manager.
[02:10:56.818 --> 02:10:57.579]  No response back.
[02:10:57.599 --> 02:11:01.180]  So, Russell Brand, if you get this message next time you're in Austin, come on the show, man.
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:03.921]  So, here's Russell Brand talks about global leaders.
[02:11:05.162 --> 02:11:07.083]  I've done a great video about Klaus Schwab before.
[02:11:07.263 --> 02:11:09.263]  You will own nothing and you will be happy.
[02:11:09.443 --> 02:11:11.804]  Which sounds like a conspiratorial idea, doesn't it?
[02:11:11.844 --> 02:11:13.064]  Oh, that's just a conspiracy.
[02:11:13.084 --> 02:11:14.084]  You're a conspiracy nut.
[02:11:14.324 --> 02:11:23.927]  Then you find out that financial partnerships and hedge funds and stuff are purchasing homes that would usually have been low to middle income American homes in suburbia, and now you can't buy those homes.
[02:11:23.967 --> 02:11:27.228]  So it's sort of like you alone nothing, but I don't be happy.
[02:11:27.608 --> 02:11:38.991]  Let's see what they have to say about their young WEF youth program that seems to produce an uncanny number of leaders before getting on to the proposals for digital ID.
[02:11:39.171 --> 02:11:45.093]  And we'll ask, are we moving towards social credit in a crazy China-stroke-black-mirror way?
[02:11:45.173 --> 02:11:55.496]  When I mention our names, like Mrs. Merkel, even Vladimir Putin and so on, they all have been young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[02:11:56.676 --> 02:12:11.228]  But what we are very proud of now is the young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau, President of Argentina and so on, that we penetrate the cabinets.
[02:12:11.649 --> 02:12:12.790]  I think I like the sound of that.
[02:12:12.990 --> 02:12:14.631]  We penetrate the cabinets.
[02:12:14.971 --> 02:12:34.869]   So yesterday I was at a reception for Prime Minister Trudeau and I We know that half of this cabinet, or even more half of this cabinet, are actually young global leaders of the world economy.
[02:12:35.134 --> 02:12:36.054]  Well, what a coincidence.
[02:12:36.074 --> 02:12:48.239]  That certainly puts to bed all those ideas that Davos and the WEF are part of a global conspiracy where powerful people come together and discuss ideas and then collaborate in how to inculcate those ideas and instantiate them without a democratic process.
[02:12:48.419 --> 02:13:00.464]  I mean, the idea that they've all been meeting up in secret and making deals is certainly quashed when you see Klaus Schwab, the founder, saying, Well, I was very surprised that nearly everybody that had penetrated that cabinet had previously penetrated the WEF.
[02:13:00.904 --> 02:13:02.945]  Don't be childish about the word penetration.
[02:13:02.965 --> 02:13:04.686]  We're not interested in that sort of thing.
[02:13:04.986 --> 02:13:06.547]  And that's true in Argentina, too.
[02:13:06.847 --> 02:13:07.088]  Wow.
[02:13:07.308 --> 02:13:08.188]  Sort your mic out!
[02:13:08.208 --> 02:13:09.729]  We're not gonna let you run the bloody world!
[02:13:09.909 --> 02:13:11.170]  Can't even run a microphone!
[02:13:11.290 --> 02:13:11.971]  Yeah, sorry.
[02:13:12.191 --> 02:13:13.552]  That's true in Argentina as well.
[02:13:13.952 --> 02:13:18.836]  It's true in Argentina, and it's true in France now, I mean, with the President.
[02:13:19.236 --> 02:13:22.418]  Oh, okay, so you just run in France, and Canada, and Argentina.
[02:13:22.598 --> 02:13:23.679]  Don't worry, though.
[02:13:23.699 --> 02:13:25.000]  Don't be a conspiracy theorist.
[02:13:28.203 --> 02:13:33.505]  They're going to have a big problem on their hands when the public wakes up to what they're doing, which is now happening.
[02:13:33.845 --> 02:13:37.787]  Let me show you some memes that I thought were pretty informative that I saw floating around.
[02:13:37.807 --> 02:13:42.849]  A cartoonist put this out, and it says it all.
[02:13:42.889 --> 02:13:47.891]  You've got the train going along, and it's just gone through the COVID-19 area.
[02:13:49.211 --> 02:13:51.812]  And they're, again, on the train track of the Great Reset.
[02:13:52.333 --> 02:13:53.893]  They've already gone through COVID-19.
[02:13:53.973 --> 02:13:55.394]  Now they're going into war.
[02:13:56.966 --> 02:14:00.508]  And now they're going into economic crisis.
[02:14:02.709 --> 02:14:05.150]  But it's not the fault of Mr. Pyramid up here.
[02:14:05.170 --> 02:14:08.651]  No, no, no, you're not looking at him.
[02:14:09.092 --> 02:14:15.415]  It's COVID-19 and the war that's going to cause the economic crisis.
[02:14:15.455 --> 02:14:19.036]  But who's up here?
[02:14:20.357 --> 02:14:22.238]  Who runs the pyramid?
[02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:28.443]  That's a larger question we should be looking at and discussing.
[02:14:29.344 --> 02:14:32.286]  But what a great cartoon.
[02:14:33.487 --> 02:14:35.929]  Boy, people are really getting it fast.
[02:14:35.969 --> 02:14:39.591]  We should reach out to this individual.
[02:14:40.212 --> 02:14:45.896]  My eyes aren't good enough to... The art of... Can we zoom in on this, guys?
[02:14:45.936 --> 02:14:46.857]  Maybe find it on Twitter?
[02:14:48.017 --> 02:14:52.841]  The art of... Whoever they are.
[02:14:53.695 --> 02:14:54.596]  I want to get them on the show.
[02:14:54.616 --> 02:14:55.056]  There you go.
[02:14:55.897 --> 02:14:57.719]  Oh, The Art of Jalapeno.
[02:14:58.820 --> 02:14:59.221]  All right.
[02:14:59.821 --> 02:15:08.070]  By Alad, Elaine, Shevely.
[02:15:08.550 --> 02:15:09.651]  Whoever they are, they're awesome.
[02:15:09.711 --> 02:15:10.773]  I want to get them on the show.
[02:15:10.793 --> 02:15:14.216]  I bet you all the tea in India, they are a listener.
[02:15:15.497 --> 02:15:16.819]  And then let's continue right here.
[02:15:17.921 --> 02:15:18.341]  A great one.
[02:15:18.361 --> 02:15:24.503]  The battle is won when the average corporate journalist is regarded the exact same way as the average tobacco executive.
[02:15:24.883 --> 02:15:26.564]  They have a job of promoting their product.
[02:15:26.844 --> 02:15:29.605]  Their product is cancerous and deadly.
[02:15:30.105 --> 02:15:31.225]  Boy, is that not true?
[02:15:31.566 --> 02:15:39.888]  With all the news about a billion dollars secretly paid out by Biden to conservative talk show host and mainline talk show host to promote the vaccine.
[02:15:42.249 --> 02:15:44.230]  And then whoever made this graphic did a great job.
[02:15:45.250 --> 02:15:47.031]  It's in the Alex Jones dank meme stash.
[02:15:48.240 --> 02:15:53.526]  The difference between authoritarianism systems and freedom, volunteerism is the correct choice.
[02:15:54.187 --> 02:16:01.795]  And it shows you the difference of volunteerism versus the different systems that are out there.
[02:16:02.055 --> 02:16:05.599]  And boy, is that not extremely accurate.
[02:16:05.960 --> 02:16:07.482]  And then I love these videos.
[02:16:07.542 --> 02:16:08.943]  We've got to find one of those compilations.
[02:16:08.983 --> 02:16:09.424]  I've seen them.
[02:16:09.844 --> 02:16:10.384]  Many times.
[02:16:10.424 --> 02:16:11.685]  I forgot to tell the crew to get one.
[02:16:12.106 --> 02:16:26.015]  But all the different compilations, sometimes they're like 20 minutes long, of dozens and dozens of reporters standing up to their necks, their knees, their chest, their waist, in water during hurricanes or floods to only learn that they have stepped down in a pond.
[02:16:26.035 --> 02:16:34.451]   That's why he's got cattails behind him and is Making it look like it's much more flooded than it was.
[02:16:35.051 --> 02:16:42.436]  Or the famous thing where they act like they're being blown around by a hurricane, but then somebody walks right behind them who is not.
[02:16:43.456 --> 02:16:43.616]  Yeah.
[02:16:44.217 --> 02:16:48.939]  If they're doing this for the weather report, what will they do for a war?
[02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:50.781]  Well, you're not allowed to ask that question.
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:56.800]  That's conspiracy theory evil.
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:04.600]  Now here's another example.
[02:17:02.712 --> 02:17:05.693]  21st century fascism invents its own symbols.
[02:17:06.193 --> 02:17:06.593]  Stop!
[02:17:08.314 --> 02:17:09.514]  And it shows the Nazis.
[02:17:10.634 --> 02:17:11.995]  They didn't invent the swastika.
[02:17:12.015 --> 02:17:15.676]  It's an ancient symbol used in all cultures, expropriated by the Nazis.
[02:17:15.696 --> 02:17:17.637]  And I don't think it should be a symbol of evil.
[02:17:17.897 --> 02:17:20.958]  You shouldn't let just because somebody does something bad with something and blame it.
[02:17:20.998 --> 02:17:26.060]  It's a very powerful sun symbol or the symbol of action.
[02:17:28.499 --> 02:17:31.301]  And then you got the Z just so they would know what group of tanks it was.
[02:17:31.762 --> 02:17:33.263]  Now they're saying that's the new symbol of evil.
[02:17:33.603 --> 02:17:38.087]  Next, they'll want to ban the letter Z. They already want to ban honk honk.
[02:17:42.170 --> 02:17:43.251]  Workers of the world, unite!
[02:17:43.371 --> 02:17:45.352]  You have nothing to lose but your chains.
[02:17:45.813 --> 02:17:46.093]  No!
[02:17:46.193 --> 02:17:47.674]  Stop uniting, you fascists!
[02:17:48.275 --> 02:17:49.215]  Take your vaccines.
[02:17:49.856 --> 02:17:51.437]  Take them or lose your jobs.
[02:17:51.737 --> 02:17:52.698]  Your jobs mean nothing.
[02:17:53.078 --> 02:17:54.319]  They'll be automated anyway.
[02:17:54.680 --> 02:17:55.941]  Do what the government says.
[02:17:57.042 --> 02:17:57.482]  That's right.
[02:17:59.261 --> 02:18:00.562]  Your enemy is not Russia.
[02:18:02.063 --> 02:18:04.364]  Your enemy is the globalist.
[02:18:04.845 --> 02:18:08.167]  Your enemy is the child molester globalist combine.
[02:18:10.448 --> 02:18:22.167]   Demons at MetaFacebook whine about Russia restricting their reach after they eliminate 90% of conservative content on their platform since 2017 and banned The U.S.
[02:18:22.848 --> 02:18:23.308]  President.
[02:18:23.728 --> 02:18:27.771]  Now Russia bans Facebook and they say it's fascist and the worst thing ever.
[02:18:28.071 --> 02:18:29.192]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy.
[02:18:29.532 --> 02:18:32.374]  I don't think they should be banning Russia, but you shouldn't have banned us.
[02:18:32.674 --> 02:18:39.559]  But they have this paradox, well, oh, you're a white supremacist, so we're gonna ban you and then we're gonna call you names and you can't respond to us there.
[02:18:41.800 --> 02:18:45.182]  CNN pulls out of Russia after Putin signs misinformation law.
[02:18:45.983 --> 02:18:49.365]  And the right wing is making jokes saying, well, they are misinformation, arrest them.
[02:18:49.705 --> 02:18:51.006]  No, no, folks, don't arrest them.
[02:18:52.076 --> 02:18:54.538]  Just know they're liars and don't let them censor other people.
[02:18:54.738 --> 02:18:55.839]  They already don't have any viewers.
[02:18:56.540 --> 02:19:04.367]  Now they could be arrested for taking the money secretly from the federal government to censor people exposing the deadly shots.
[02:19:04.887 --> 02:19:06.669]  That's being part of a criminal conspiracy.
[02:19:09.318 --> 02:19:22.348]  Treasury sanctions Russia-backed news outlets for advancing false narratives that undermine COVID vaccines, paint Ukraine as aggressor, and they're going after anything they say picks up or covers Russian news.
[02:19:22.688 --> 02:19:23.729]  Well, that would be us.
[02:19:24.329 --> 02:19:38.171]   I mean, we link and post stuff from the Democratic Party, from Antifa, from Trump, from the Republicans, from The Zapatista rebels from everybody.
[02:19:38.391 --> 02:19:40.853]  Because we want to have a record of it and have a debate about it.
[02:19:43.134 --> 02:19:47.318]  But we're not taking money from groups to lie to people about poison shots.
[02:19:49.019 --> 02:19:51.581]  But there's Yellen, been devaluing our dollar.
[02:19:53.482 --> 02:19:54.863]  Now involved in censoring.
[02:19:56.685 --> 02:19:57.566]  Here's another great meme.
[02:19:58.126 --> 02:20:07.603]   You've got the NPCs, Don A lot of folks have said, well, people didn't care if they killed Iraqis because they're brown.
[02:20:07.442 --> 02:20:12.342]   Yemen, Palestine, all the other wars, but oh my gosh, Ukraine.
[02:20:12.342 --> 02:20:16.563]  Because when the West is attacking a country, it's good.
[02:20:16.563 --> 02:20:20.801]   When another country is attacking another country, it's bad if that country is their enemy.
[02:20:20.801 --> 02:20:24.242]   A lot of folks have said, well, people didn't care if they killed Iraqis
[02:20:24.242 --> 02:20:25.322]  'cause they're brown.
[02:20:25.322 --> 02:20:29.563]   And people didn't care if they killed Syrians 'cause they were brown.
[02:20:29.563 --> 02:20:35.801]   No, it was because the globalist West was attacking those countries.
[02:20:35.801 --> 02:20:38.801]  And so the media was telling you that it was good.
[02:20:38.801 --> 02:20:48.801]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:20:40.342 --> 02:20:44.984]  In the case of Russia, it's the other power bloc attacking a country, and so that's why you're being told it's bad.
[02:20:45.284 --> 02:20:52.567]  If Russia was attacking a country that was brown, you'd be hearing probably even more stuff because the globalists are anti-Russia.
[02:20:52.847 --> 02:20:56.788]  Doesn't mean, again, I defend Russia going in there with what it's doing.
[02:20:56.808 --> 02:20:58.989]  I think it's been set up and drawn into a trap.
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:08.548]  And I'm very sad for all the sides and what's happening and very mad at Soros for going in there and destabilizing things with the globalists, which then precipitated this.
[02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:12.032]  Because make no mistake, the West started this.
[02:21:12.372 --> 02:21:16.597]  Doesn't mean I think it's a good idea what Putin did, but the West poked, poked, poked the bear.
[02:21:17.998 --> 02:21:28.365]  And that's the whole thing that Trevor Noah gets into about, oh look, there's footage at train stations where there was only one train a day going out of this particular city.
[02:21:29.166 --> 02:21:30.587]  And I watched the actual raw footage.
[02:21:30.627 --> 02:21:31.907]  They weren't letting men on.
[02:21:32.428 --> 02:21:40.033]  They weren't letting, no, they were checking IDs and seeing who the Russians might be targeting, who is a political dissident.
[02:21:41.173 --> 02:21:47.813]   And so they were letting women and children on and the people from Africa and the people from India
[02:21:47.813 --> 02:21:54.053]   were not there with children. And I'm not defending the Ukrainians and saying they're perfect.
[02:21:54.053 --> 02:21:57.413]   I actually went and found out what happened. If you go watch the footage, it was already
[02:21:57.413 --> 02:22:04.293]   stuffed days before, of men and single women not being allowed on trains.
[02:22:04.529 --> 02:22:05.709]  And people getting in fights.
[02:22:06.109 --> 02:22:11.692]  And when you see on the other side, the Poles, it says, Poles give toys to the women and children.
[02:22:12.072 --> 02:22:13.772]  The men didn't go with them.
[02:22:14.133 --> 02:22:17.634]  They wouldn't let the men, unless they were old, on the trains.
[02:22:17.834 --> 02:22:21.656]  Because when the ship's sinking, you put the women and children on it.
[02:22:22.956 --> 02:22:36.569]   So yeah, you're Indian or you're African, you're obviously here on a student visa or whatever, the Russians aren't going to be killing you, they're going to be killing People they have lists of that are Ukrainians.
[02:22:37.690 --> 02:22:47.194]  And they also knew that there was an Indian delegation and also several African delegations and a UN delegation putting people on airplanes and flying them out.
[02:22:47.574 --> 02:22:53.457]  And India said yesterday, all Indian citizens have been picked up by buses, taken to airports.
[02:22:53.837 --> 02:22:56.719]  India sent in planes and they have left.
[02:22:59.260 --> 02:23:01.541]  But see, the left couldn't help themselves with Trevor Noah.
[02:23:03.063 --> 02:23:06.628]  They had to make it about black versus white, or brown versus whatever.
[02:23:07.329 --> 02:23:15.821]  And so they went and cherry-picked videos of college students not being allowed on the trains.
[02:23:16.202 --> 02:23:19.026]  They weren't letting the other college students on the trains.
[02:23:20.219 --> 02:23:22.979]  Because it's a collapsing war zone.
[02:23:23.280 --> 02:23:36.522]  But you've got the South African communist worth millions of dollars, Trevor Noah, up here following his script to create racial division in America so George Soros and the New World Order can hide behind blackface.
[02:23:38.102 --> 02:23:39.142]  You know, I was thinking about this.
[02:23:39.182 --> 02:23:48.404]  There was a Lando Lakes butter that had a beautiful female Native American on it.
[02:23:49.625 --> 02:23:52.206]  And she's like in a praying position and it's just the goddess.
[02:23:52.886 --> 02:23:57.507]  And it's a beautiful lake and beautiful trees and a beautiful sky with a beautiful woman.
[02:23:57.747 --> 02:23:59.427]  And it makes you want that butter.
[02:23:59.447 --> 02:24:03.468]  I remember being a little kid and getting the butter out and looking at the Indian and just liking it.
[02:24:05.909 --> 02:24:06.949]  Yeah, scroll down and show this.
[02:24:08.129 --> 02:24:09.609]  Well, now they've taken that off.
[02:24:13.150 --> 02:24:17.311]  They've taken her off saying it was cultural appropriation.
[02:24:18.288 --> 02:24:20.270]  And they took Uncle Ben off the rice.
[02:24:22.933 --> 02:24:23.934]  I sent you guys a tweet of it.
[02:24:23.954 --> 02:24:24.315]  Do you have it?
[02:24:25.956 --> 02:24:26.637]  I'll show it on my phone.
[02:24:26.657 --> 02:24:26.957]  It's fine.
[02:24:28.459 --> 02:24:34.926]  And so, the point is, is that cultural appropriation is a bunch of bull, okay?
[02:24:37.649 --> 02:24:51.291]   But the point is, is that It's cultural appropriation when I watch any internet ad or any TV ad and no one in corporate media has responded to this or talked about why they're doing it.
[02:24:51.331 --> 02:24:51.952]  I know why they're doing it.
[02:24:52.352 --> 02:24:59.375]  And 90% of the spokespersons are black, including in Australia and Europe and areas that have hardly any black people.
[02:25:00.015 --> 02:25:01.156]  And you're like, why are they doing it?
[02:25:01.176 --> 02:25:02.856]  It's not to give black actors jobs.
[02:25:03.356 --> 02:25:13.101]  It is literally corporate world hiding behind blackface while they cut the food off for years in Africa and starve tens of millions of people to death with the lockdowns.
[02:25:13.401 --> 02:25:18.783]  It is just the most cold-blooded, globalist crap the world has ever seen.
[02:25:19.023 --> 02:25:22.165]  With Bill Gates saying, I'm worried about African population.
[02:25:22.485 --> 02:25:23.585]  I want to depopulate them.
[02:25:23.965 --> 02:25:25.706]  Oh, depopulate black people.
[02:25:25.966 --> 02:25:26.867]  That's so liberal.
[02:25:27.127 --> 02:25:36.603]   But oh, We can't have Uncle Ben... We can't have... I've got an article right here.
[02:25:36.724 --> 02:25:43.088]  Catholic University scraps its seal because it looks like a white man giving directions.
[02:25:43.548 --> 02:25:53.335]  And it says on the seal, if you guys can pull it up, that it's just a priest pointing, and then you see some Native Americans.
[02:25:53.595 --> 02:25:54.196]  Oh my God!
[02:25:54.216 --> 02:25:56.137]  A white person pointing!
[02:25:58.137 --> 02:25:59.117]  You can't have that.
[02:26:01.438 --> 02:26:05.618]  Oh my gosh, the native is rowing him.
[02:26:05.738 --> 02:26:06.899]  He's his slave.
[02:26:07.899 --> 02:26:09.019]  You can't have that.
[02:26:09.399 --> 02:26:11.439]  I mean, just what a mindless joke.
[02:26:11.739 --> 02:26:15.040]  But that's what the system does.
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:17.461]  They attack all the symbols.
[02:26:17.280 --> 02:26:20.619]  they demonize things that aren't bad.
[02:26:20.619 --> 02:26:27.539]  Because they want the power over the symbols.
[02:26:26.189 --> 02:26:28.751]  They want the power to decide what you can show and what you can't show.
[02:26:28.771 --> 02:26:34.674]  All right, let me hit some final, very, very important news.
[02:26:36.295 --> 02:26:41.339]  And I love how it comes from a famous painting, painted right... I was looking it up.
[02:26:41.359 --> 02:26:42.820]  Good job pulling that up, guys.
[02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:43.700]  I didn't even tell you to do that.
[02:26:45.081 --> 02:26:49.904]  And in the famous painting, the chief is telling him where to go to found the city.
[02:26:51.105 --> 02:26:56.119]   You know, a lot of the country got founded by Catholic missionaries setting up missions.
[02:26:56.779 --> 02:26:57.600]  All of them got killed.
[02:26:58.740 --> 02:27:01.441]  And he's pointing the native chief saying, that's where you go down the river.
[02:27:01.801 --> 02:27:02.522]  He says, that way?
[02:27:02.582 --> 02:27:03.542]  So it's them in agreement.
[02:27:05.003 --> 02:27:07.164]  And they're looking towards the future and the founding.
[02:27:07.544 --> 02:27:10.165]  And it's just a moment of communication.
[02:27:10.605 --> 02:27:14.367]  But no, no, it's the white man telling them what to do.
[02:27:14.607 --> 02:27:16.688]  It's so insane.
[02:27:19.749 --> 02:27:21.730]  That's why the Teddy Roosevelt statue down in New York.
[02:27:22.995 --> 02:27:26.016]  The guy that got the first civil rights laws passed after the Civil War.
[02:27:26.736 --> 02:27:28.916]  Huge advocate for empowering everybody.
[02:27:30.797 --> 02:27:34.578]  But he's on a horse and the Native American and the black guy are walking in front of him.
[02:27:35.658 --> 02:27:36.478]  So you can't have it.
[02:27:37.339 --> 02:27:44.420]  It's all about mindless idiocy and being able to shut down and take down whatever you want, whenever they want.
[02:27:46.681 --> 02:27:50.662]  While at the same time, this is happening.
[02:27:54.761 --> 02:27:57.422]  The most dangerous people are the ones you cannot criticize.
[02:28:00.323 --> 02:28:09.848]  And when you look at these articles I've got right here, people on Twitter are now being blocked from sharing this tweet.
[02:28:10.848 --> 02:28:11.949]  And what is the tweet of?
[02:28:13.549 --> 02:28:17.951]  It is a boil-down from a stock site.
[02:28:19.232 --> 02:28:20.472]  What is this, MSNBC?
[02:28:21.293 --> 02:28:21.813]  No, CNBC?
[02:28:23.869 --> 02:28:27.131]  Showing the cost of commodities.
[02:28:28.632 --> 02:28:37.959]  Silver, copper, wheat, gold, Brent crude, natural gas, crude oil at $115 a barrel.
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:42.362]  Brent crude at $118 a barrel.
[02:28:44.283 --> 02:28:50.528]  And you're not allowed to show that because we don't want people, you can't have little people talking about wheat prices going up.
[02:28:53.342 --> 02:28:55.923]  And Elon Musk has made his big fortune off electric cars.
[02:28:55.943 --> 02:29:00.764]  And I'll say, without all the electric cars out there, he's got the best looking ones and certainly the best running ones.
[02:29:01.384 --> 02:29:02.944]  But is it good for the environment?
[02:29:03.424 --> 02:29:05.204]  The energy comes from the same place, fossil fuels.
[02:29:06.305 --> 02:29:07.645]  Elon Musk calls for U.S.
[02:29:07.685 --> 02:29:09.405]  to increase oil and gas production.
[02:29:10.325 --> 02:29:11.766]  Hate to say it, but we need to.
[02:29:11.886 --> 02:29:13.866]  But Biden says, no, no, no.
[02:29:16.007 --> 02:29:19.487]  Yeah, how are you going to sell any cars if the whole economy falters?
[02:29:20.047 --> 02:29:21.168]  Well, we're in a transition.
[02:29:21.228 --> 02:29:22.368]  Yeah, to collapsing.
[02:29:22.995 --> 02:29:24.676]  Then they blame it on the war or they blame it on COVID.
[02:29:27.656 --> 02:29:28.857]  And it just goes on from there.
[02:29:29.297 --> 02:29:42.701]  But they're paying way less than a dollar a barrel or a gallon in Russia for their oil because their government has decided not to rip them off.
[02:29:43.982 --> 02:29:49.343]  And I guess as bad as the economy is under all the sanctions, they might as well have cheap oil in Russia.
[02:29:50.244 --> 02:29:51.184]  Simply insane.
[02:29:52.412 --> 02:29:55.995]  Okay, I want to thank the crew for doing a fabulous job coming in on Saturday.
[02:29:56.536 --> 02:30:02.661]  The world is so crazy, I told you months ago that I would, in March, start going at least seven days a week.
[02:30:03.582 --> 02:30:14.871]  But March is here, and I'm going to start doing weeknight shows, and I'll be announcing some of that this week, for two to three hours at night, several nights a week.
[02:30:15.652 --> 02:30:21.415]  Where I just come in here and have special guests and take calls and cover news, commercial free, because millions of people tune into these.
[02:30:21.835 --> 02:30:23.576]  I'm very honored and blessed that you tune in.
[02:30:24.236 --> 02:30:26.177]  And all of you are welcome.
[02:30:26.257 --> 02:30:38.242]  I humbly ask you to take clips out, edit it however you want, put it on Instagram, put it on Twitter, put it on YouTube, put it on Rumble, put it on Getter, put it on whatever platform you want.
[02:30:38.906 --> 02:30:40.927]  Short clips, long clips, whatever you want.
[02:30:41.487 --> 02:30:55.191]  Realize that's how this is getting out to not just the millions that tune in at Band.Video and InfoWars.com forward slash show, but to all the other people who then discover, hey, Alex Jones is still on air and you can find him.
[02:30:55.631 --> 02:31:01.352]  You can find the forbidden information at InfoWars.com and then we defeat the globalists.
[02:31:01.412 --> 02:31:02.493]  It's that simple.
[02:31:02.533 --> 02:31:03.453]  We're going to win together.
[02:31:03.833 --> 02:31:06.354]  As they say, the propaganda wouldn't be necessary.
[02:31:07.074 --> 02:31:08.855]  If the situation was hopeless.
[02:31:10.597 --> 02:31:16.381]  They wouldn't be trying to suppress all of us if the truth wasn't powerful and what incredibly powerful.
[02:31:17.462 --> 02:31:18.542]  Reports we aired.
[02:31:19.683 --> 02:31:22.645]  At the start of the broadcast today.
[02:31:24.146 --> 02:31:27.469]  And in fact, I'm just going to end the broadcast the way we started the broadcast.
[02:31:29.010 --> 02:31:44.007]   And that is with this special report By Greg Rees confirming the Pentagon did fund bioweapons labs in the Ukraine, just like what we saw with the Wuhan situation and all that came out there.
[02:31:44.047 --> 02:31:46.670]  So I'm very thankful for you joining us and spending time with us.
[02:31:47.131 --> 02:31:50.134]  I'll be back tomorrow night, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:31:50.434 --> 02:31:51.335]  Then Owen, 6 to 8 p.m.
[02:31:52.401 --> 02:31:53.402]  We're Sunday live.
[02:31:53.662 --> 02:31:54.803]  There'll be so much to cover then.
[02:31:54.863 --> 02:31:57.886]  I hope we're still here tomorrow, every day, that we're not in a nuclear war.
[02:31:57.946 --> 02:32:10.056]  It's a blessed day, so pray for peace, pray for a global awakening, and pray for Putin, you know, and to have his heart moved to try to reach out and get some type of a detente and a ceasefire here.
[02:32:10.076 --> 02:32:20.932]   It's a good sign that the Russians and the Germans are talking about not having Ukraine join NATO, and the Russians say that If that happens, then they may pull out.
[02:32:21.272 --> 02:32:23.653]  And now Germany's saying that that is indeed the case.
[02:32:24.154 --> 02:32:26.615]  They're not going to go along with them joining NATO.
[02:32:27.095 --> 02:32:29.857]  So hopefully this can be de-escalated very, very quickly.
[02:32:30.537 --> 02:32:32.358]  But again, thank you all for joining us.
[02:32:32.398 --> 02:32:33.378]  A great job of the crew.
[02:32:34.938 --> 02:32:51.497]  Good night and God bless.
[02:32:51.616 --> 02:32:55.582]  is running secret biological weapons labs around their borders.
[02:32:56.443 --> 02:33:01.830]  And while Western media now claims this to be misinformation, back in 2013, they reported on it.
[02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:16.048]  While the United States and Murder Incorporated have been waging illegal wars all across the world in the name of democracy, Russia has been quietly selling energy and minding their own business.
[02:33:16.468 --> 02:33:23.273]  And according to National Geographic, this was the reason why the Pentagon was building these bioweapons labs in the first place.
[02:33:23.733 --> 02:33:27.716]  Because Russia was entirely quiet on the subject, and the U.S.
[02:33:28.016 --> 02:33:29.037]  wanted to get ahead of them.
[02:33:30.225 --> 02:33:34.309]  The initial biolab in Kazakhstan was built by the U.S.
[02:33:34.489 --> 02:33:49.004]  for $100 million to store high-risk diseases such as plague and anthrax and was hoping to attract scientists who might otherwise create biological weapons of mass destruction for someone else.
[02:33:50.165 --> 02:33:54.252]   In order to keep the world safe, The U.S.
[02:33:54.433 --> 02:33:57.215]  has since built several labs in Kazakhstan.
[02:33:58.036 --> 02:34:02.620]  Most recently, a biosafety level 4 lab to be completed in early 2022.
[02:34:05.042 --> 02:34:17.072]  As early as 2004, the Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA, began creating a network of biolabs for infectious diseases in Uzbekistan.
[02:34:17.873 --> 02:34:25.577]  And within a few years after operations began, outbreaks of unknown diseases were reported in the same areas as the labs.
[02:34:26.777 --> 02:34:29.678]  In Georgia, leaked documents show that the U.S.
[02:34:29.798 --> 02:34:37.862]  Embassy has been transporting deadly pathogens and human blood as diplomatic cargo, in a scheme where private U.S.
[02:34:37.922 --> 02:34:40.423]  contractors working for three different U.S.
[02:34:40.503 --> 02:34:44.125]  biolabs have been given diplomatic immunity to do so.
[02:34:45.842 --> 02:34:52.709]  Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, At War Clandestine released a video with maps of U.S.
[02:34:52.789 --> 02:35:00.017]  biolabs matching up with maps of the recent attack, suggesting that Russia was securing these top-secret biolabs.
[02:35:01.258 --> 02:35:05.099]  Western media claims this is false, but fails to debunk it.
[02:35:05.879 --> 02:35:08.260]  And once the video goes viral, the U.S.
[02:35:08.340 --> 02:35:12.741]  Embassy in Ukraine is caught deleting evidence of these labs from their website.
[02:35:13.501 --> 02:35:20.983]  But not before an independent journalist was able to copy documents showing 11 Ukrainian biolabs funded by the Pentagon.
[02:35:21.923 --> 02:35:25.167]  The Russian Embassy to Bosnia has accused the U.S.
[02:35:25.487 --> 02:35:33.898]  of filling Ukraine with biolabs, which were very possibly used to study methods for destroying the Russian people at the genetic level.
[02:35:35.140 --> 02:35:40.904]  And we now know that these so-called mRNA vaccines are destroying people at the genetic level.
[02:35:41.384 --> 02:35:45.487]  We now officially know that COVID-19 is a man-made bioweapon.
[02:35:45.987 --> 02:35:51.110]  We know that it was funded by elements of the NIH and Peter Daszak's EcoHealth Alliance.
[02:35:51.650 --> 02:35:53.712]  We know that it was made in Wuhan, China.
[02:35:54.915 --> 02:35:57.617]  And so, what isn't threatening about the U.S.
[02:35:57.737 --> 02:36:00.378]  encircling Russia with top-secret biolabs?
[02:36:01.419 --> 02:36:11.044]  And who on Earth thinks it's a coincidence that everyone involved in the United Nations' Great Reset are now the Ukraine's greatest allies of all time?
[02:36:12.145 --> 02:36:18.308]  The mercenaries and war profiteers in America are getting excited about making short-term profits off the dead.
[02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:29.075]  But the only ones who will benefit from this war are the crooks at the top who have been caught committing the most heinous crime against humanity in all of recorded history.
[02:36:30.075 --> 02:36:33.958]  And the only righteous way out of this is to hold these crooks accountable.
[02:36:35.418 --> 02:36:37.978]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reis.
[02:36:37.978 --> 02:36:52.539]  It's hard to believe that we're already into March 2022.
[02:36:53.145 --> 02:37:11.857]  And in the month of February, we had a very popular sale that was going of our flagship product X3 that has all three types of the amazing iodine your body needs for every electrochemical cellular activity in your body, your immune system, your stamina, your libido, so much.
[02:37:11.977 --> 02:37:15.559]  And the majority of the population in the world is iodine deficient.
[02:37:15.579 --> 02:37:17.361]  This is the very best iodine out there.
[02:37:18.181 --> 02:37:21.523]  We had it on sale at 50% off, but we sold more than half of what we have.
[02:37:22.003 --> 02:37:25.904]  More isn't going to come in for a long time, so I took it back to full price.
[02:37:25.924 --> 02:37:27.145]  And I was just thinking, you know what?
[02:37:27.525 --> 02:37:29.426]  We need the funds in now to stay on air.
[02:37:29.846 --> 02:37:31.747]  Plus, this is a great product everybody needs.
[02:37:32.227 --> 02:37:41.311]  So to incentivize folks out there that have been on the fence to get X3 and experience it for yourself and support the broadcast, I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out.
[02:37:41.771 --> 02:37:45.132]  Get X3 right now exclusively at Infowarestore.com for 50% off.
