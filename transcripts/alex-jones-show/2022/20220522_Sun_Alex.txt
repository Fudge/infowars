[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]  [outro]
[00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:14.321]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:16.263 --> 00:00:22.263]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.263 --> 00:00:46.263]  [Music]
[00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:50.263]  Many of us didn't see it yet in early 2020.
[00:00:50.463 --> 00:01:01.517]  But today, millions of us are now aware of the emerging one-world government and their deceitful plans to seize power hidden under the guise of world health.
[00:01:02.802 --> 00:01:12.486]  And many of us are now awake to the fact that this so-called New World Order is religiously paganistic, luciferic, and satanic.
[00:01:13.247 --> 00:01:25.913]  So it's no surprise that their coronation ball climaxes on May 28th with a devil-horned moon and the Jupiter-Mars conjunction, which is believed to bring success when starting a war.
[00:01:27.134 --> 00:01:41.091]  Their big week of megalomania begins on May 22nd in Switzerland with both the World Health Organization's annual World Health Assembly and the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos.
[00:01:41.992 --> 00:01:56.674]  In Geneva, the WHO will be voting on a pandemic treaty known officially as the Zero Draft Report of the Working Group on Strengthening WHO Preparedness and Response to Health Emergencies.
[00:01:57.662 --> 00:02:04.087]  This pandemic treaty will make them the directing and coordinating authority on international health.
[00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:20.140]  The WHO's Zero Draft Plan includes regular simulation exercises, global surveillance, more vaccines, more censorship, contact tracing, and digital vaccine passports.
[00:02:21.505 --> 00:02:28.992]  In Davos, Klaus Schwab's World Economic Forum's annual meeting theme is History at a Turning Point.
[00:02:29.772 --> 00:02:37.660]  Their agenda includes more vaccines, more censorship, and more LGBTQI resilience.
[00:02:38.976 --> 00:03:03.593]  The same week in Indonesia, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction is holding their annual Global Platform, where they will be planning for regular ongoing pandemic simulations, more global governance, more money to fight climate change, and ultimately accomplishing the United Nations 2030 Agenda, also known as the Great Reset.
[00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:18.005]  After the New World Order's narcissistic coronation week ends, with the devil-horned moon and the Jupiter-Mars conjunction, Klaus Schwab and his fellow Satanists can celebrate with their friends at CERN.
[00:03:18.926 --> 00:03:19.426]  And then what?
[00:03:20.481 --> 00:03:31.845]  In March of 2021, the Nuclear Threat Initiative conducted a tabletop exercise simulating a global pandemic involving a monkeypox terrorist attack.
[00:03:32.806 --> 00:03:35.647]  Something that Bill Gates has told us to expect.
[00:03:36.567 --> 00:03:41.509]  The Biden administration has just bought millions of doses of monkeypox vaccines.
[00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.250]  And mysterious cases are now being reported.
[00:03:46.291 --> 00:03:57.676]  The final assault of the New World Order will involve a man-made bio-attack, food shortages, FEMA camps, rolling blackouts, and endless riots.
[00:03:58.817 --> 00:04:03.379]  Violence may save your life someday, and it might save our freedom.
[00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:05.459]  But it's not a solution.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:17.724]  If we really wanted to solve this problem, we could all peacefully convene at our local government council and demand either their allegiance to the Constitution or their immediate resignation.
[00:04:18.404 --> 00:04:22.905]  Because the New World Order is not going to surrender, and the entire U.S.
[00:04:22.945 --> 00:04:24.586]  government is under their control.
[00:04:26.041 --> 00:04:33.747]  This coming Memorial Day, remember and honor the ancestors who died for our freedom, because it may very well be our last.
[00:04:34.068 --> 00:04:39.832]  Here we need a vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector.
[00:04:40.493 --> 00:04:45.857]  It offers the only real prospect of achieving fundamental economic transition.
[00:04:46.738 --> 00:04:49.200]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.002]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday, May 22nd.
[00:04:54.402 --> 00:04:56.044]  We have breaking massive intel.
[00:04:56.064 --> 00:04:57.745]  Stay with us back in 60 seconds.
[00:05:00.468 --> 00:05:02.469]  Hard to believe it's Sunday, May 22nd.
[00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:03.550]  The year is 2022.
[00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:12.218]  We're about to break exclusive global information with this bomb show.
[00:05:12.358 --> 00:05:13.119]  InfoWars.
[00:05:13.278 --> 00:05:15.278]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:05:15.278 --> 00:05:25.358]  This is a Sunday emergency broadcast.
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.780]  New global lockdowns imminent.
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.061]  A smokescreen for impending worldwide financial collapse.
[00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:34.882]  Announcement of the new world order, the global cashless society control grid.
[00:05:35.642 --> 00:05:42.864]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live Sunday broadcast that was supposed to be taken off the air years ago.
[00:05:43.564 --> 00:05:44.445]  The globalists failed.
[00:05:44.585 --> 00:05:49.106]  I'm going to try to be very calm today and get through all this news.
[00:05:49.126 --> 00:05:50.226]  I've done a lot of preparation.
[00:05:51.553 --> 00:05:52.573]  What I'm about to lay out.
[00:05:53.454 --> 00:05:54.774]  But let me just say this.
[00:05:56.254 --> 00:05:57.995]  All of this is completely transparent.
[00:05:58.075 --> 00:06:01.436]  That the COVID-19 was produced in a lab.
[00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:03.616]  That this is a lab-grown monkeypox.
[00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:10.878]  That they war-gamed the last few years having the next pandemic be a smallpox variant monkeypox specifically.
[00:06:11.598 --> 00:06:16.620]  Bill Gates is there as if we're blind and stupid preparing the entire thing with the UN.
[00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:26.500]  Right as they meet trying to get countries to sign their sovereignty over in Switzerland next week to the World Economic Forum in the UN.
[00:06:27.421 --> 00:06:37.248]  Two weeks ago the United Nations publicly merged with the World Economic Forum saying they will take corporate orders from the Bilderberg Group created organization.
[00:06:37.288 --> 00:06:47.515]   So we have lived to see the Bilderberg Group from being secret With this world government depopulation aims to now having the World Economic Forum in control of the United Nations.
[00:06:47.795 --> 00:06:49.376]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:06:49.416 --> 00:06:52.839]  The New World Order is preparing their final attack.
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:58.603]  Now, we have all the evidence of that.
[00:06:58.643 --> 00:06:59.544]  We're going to be going over it.
[00:07:00.555 --> 00:07:06.838]  Then we have the other prongs, the other heads of the Hydra, how they're coming after humanity for depopulation.
[00:07:07.478 --> 00:07:11.820]  And Bill Maher even saying they're targeting children with a trans agenda to sterilize them.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.180]  That's what it is.
[00:07:14.441 --> 00:07:19.223]  Within some Democrat-controlled areas, up to half the elementary students identifying as another sex.
[00:07:19.483 --> 00:07:24.025]  This is total brainwashing, total control, the end of our species as we know it.
[00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:26.046]  We have that information.
[00:07:27.304 --> 00:07:31.145]  Then we have Biden signing the $40 billion Ukraine aid package as U.S.
[00:07:31.165 --> 00:07:35.146]  stocks suffered the longest losing streak since the Great Depression.
[00:07:36.627 --> 00:07:54.472]  We're going to be looking at every different angle of this as even the U.N., who's been running it, and the World Economic Forum warn of the very worldwide food collapse they have engineered that we told you would happen 27 months ago when they initiated this phase of Agenda 2030, now that they have implemented Agenda 21.
[00:07:56.906 --> 00:08:15.061]  Also today, and I'm going to cover this when we get into all this Monkeypox Lockdown 2.0 news in the next segment, is that I've already read a lot of big studies, I've talked to a lot of different sources, but I also have sources of individuals that have been the chief scientists at major pharmaceutical companies.
[00:08:16.282 --> 00:08:20.126]  I have sources right here in Austin that head up large biotech companies.
[00:08:21.124 --> 00:08:33.752]  Genetic engineering companies, and I have sources, there are some of the most prominent people in the liberty movement, the medical freedom movement, the anti-globalist movement, that realize this is a global biomedical tyranny takeover.
[00:08:34.632 --> 00:08:40.776]  Now I've known this for over a year and a half, and Mike Adams wrote articles about it a year and a half ago at Natural News, and showed the studies.
[00:08:41.717 --> 00:08:52.447]   But now I have talked to multiple individuals separately, who have been to the major laboratories in the United States and Europe, And they named names, but we're not able to release it yet.
[00:08:54.268 --> 00:09:09.061]  Where they have gone in and sequenced with billion-dollar equipment, CRISPR systems, what the spike protein is doing that is implemented in the body via the Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and J&J injections.
[00:09:10.962 --> 00:09:13.645]  The J&J and AstraZeneca do it one way.
[00:09:13.705 --> 00:09:18.429]  They inject a virus with a DNA pet payload of different animals.
[00:09:19.416 --> 00:09:25.416]   into your body and then orders your cells to make that part of your DNA that's passed on to the next generation.
[00:09:25.416 --> 00:09:32.456]   It's done similarly by affecting the outside of the cell and programming it to go to the nuclei with the mRNA
[00:09:32.456 --> 00:09:33.416]  injections.
[00:09:33.416 --> 00:09:39.416]   But what we know is, and this has already come out, I mean this is in the mainline medical literature.
[00:09:39.416 --> 00:09:45.416]   I showed this on Friday that, in fact, can you guys pull that out of Friday's stack?
[00:09:45.493 --> 00:10:01.261]  It was just a bunch of big studies on chimpanzee and animal DNA in all of these injections and also human DNA that they mix in to the other genetic code, RNA, DNA they're putting in.
[00:10:01.581 --> 00:10:15.508]   They then put in animal and human DNA into that, carrying other viruses and other payloads that will then be released, not just in this generation, but particularly in future generations.
[00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:20.951]  The spike protein alone is then absorbed because it has human and animal DNA attached to it.
[00:10:21.751 --> 00:10:30.356]  And then your body starts producing spike protein that gives you cancer, that destroys your fertility, that causes prion disease in the liver and the brain.
[00:10:30.916 --> 00:10:31.877]  And this is all admitted.
[00:10:33.655 --> 00:10:48.282]  It is now confirmed, ladies and gentlemen, that this is the kill switch being implemented into the very DNA of our bodies, and it particularly migrates into the ovaries and testicles.
[00:10:48.602 --> 00:10:49.842]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:10:51.723 --> 00:10:53.744]  This is the most important information we've ever covered.
[00:10:54.584 --> 00:10:57.886]  And I'll probably in a week or two say this is the most important, because things are escalating.
[00:10:59.397 --> 00:11:03.341]  Twenty years ago, maybe once or twice, every few years I'd say this is the most important information.
[00:11:03.761 --> 00:11:07.665]  Now it's almost every day because it's all unfolding.
[00:11:07.746 --> 00:11:21.399]  And if we don't figure out what they're doing, and we have figured it all out from their own statements and plans, this broadcast has, and many of our guests have, and if we don't get that to the rest of the leaders in the world that don't know what they're facing, it's the end of humanity as we know it.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.462]  This is not a dystopic science fiction horror movie.
[00:11:24.862 --> 00:11:27.944]  This is 2022 on the planet Earth.
[00:11:28.504 --> 00:11:29.865]  They're announcing world government.
[00:11:30.245 --> 00:11:38.851]  They're announcing global digital IDs to buy and sell everywhere from Italy to France to Germany to Australia to Canada.
[00:11:39.271 --> 00:11:42.734]  They are announcing just unbelievable information.
[00:11:42.754 --> 00:11:44.575]  We're going to cover every bit of it.
[00:11:45.467 --> 00:11:53.933]  Here today, and I'm going to host Summit of the Third Hour, and Owen Schroer is going to be taking over with Sunday Live, 6 to 8 p.m., but I'm here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:11:55.133 --> 00:11:59.476]  We have some special documentaries we're going to air, so much tonight, so much this afternoon.
[00:12:00.297 --> 00:12:18.089]   But this is 18 minutes of clips of myself in the last two years, going back to January of 2020, when they weren't even really hyping COVID yet, specifically predicting it would erase your immune system, specifically predicting That they would then bring out more viruses, particularly smallpox, specifically doing it.
[00:12:18.109 --> 00:12:18.810]  And how did I know?
[00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:23.553]  Because they run war games that are really the criminal battle plans of what they're going to do.
[00:12:24.074 --> 00:12:26.116]  So they get caught, they go, oh, it's just a drill.
[00:12:26.836 --> 00:12:28.157]  So we've learned how they operate.
[00:12:28.177 --> 00:12:31.500]  And I've had the former head of defense intelligence confirm our analysis.
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.761]  I've had many others confirm it.
[00:12:33.001 --> 00:12:34.462]  We know what we're talking about here.
[00:12:34.883 --> 00:12:35.763]  This is life and death.
[00:12:35.783 --> 00:12:37.445]  And you can pretend you're part of the power structure.
[00:12:39.522 --> 00:12:43.364]  And it'd be destroyed, or you can wake up and realize going along with this is living death.
[00:12:43.864 --> 00:12:45.165]  So this is an 18-minute clip.
[00:12:45.205 --> 00:12:46.906]  I'm just gonna air two minutes of it as we go to break.
[00:12:47.746 --> 00:12:48.847]  It's on Bandot Video.
[00:12:48.867 --> 00:12:49.507]  I hope you share it.
[00:12:49.527 --> 00:12:50.808]  It's life and death.
[00:12:51.328 --> 00:12:53.329]  Alex Jones predicted the monkeypox outbreak.
[00:12:53.769 --> 00:12:57.971]  These are clips going back over two years, right through to last week before it even happened.
[00:12:58.211 --> 00:12:58.632]  Here it is.
[00:12:58.672 --> 00:12:59.112]  We'll be right back.
[00:13:02.671 --> 00:13:10.833]  Well, they plan to have smaller bioweapon releases that aren't as deadly to get the global control system in place and then have bigger releases.
[00:13:10.853 --> 00:13:16.055]  They're going to have limited bioweapon releases at first that get us to then take vaccines that remove our immunity.
[00:13:16.355 --> 00:13:17.775]  They launch a simulant they own.
[00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:20.476]  They put vaccines in you that are binary weapons that lower your immunity.
[00:13:22.233 --> 00:13:23.613]  And then they start releasing the real stuff.
[00:13:23.653 --> 00:13:28.415]  And I believe they're going to launch a new bio-attack, a whole separate virus, other than COVID, very soon.
[00:13:28.435 --> 00:13:34.877]  They're saying, OK, this pandemic's ending, but a new one's coming soon when another super virus pops up.
[00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:39.696]   But you'll be trained to lock down and then the next thing comes in a year or two and then the next one and then
[00:13:39.696 --> 00:13:42.456]   One hits that's billions and you all sit in your houses and die
[00:13:59.817 --> 00:14:05.706]   We talk about how they plan to have smaller Bioweapon releases that aren't as deadly to get the global
[00:14:05.706 --> 00:14:11.836]   control system in place and then have bigger Releases then tightening the grip of global control
[00:14:11.836 --> 00:14:21.742]   During the larger depopulation events that happen And then the deep state globally pretending it's the savior, while it's actually organizing the operation.
[00:14:21.982 --> 00:14:23.422]  And they're also binary weapons.
[00:14:23.482 --> 00:14:30.245]  We talked about yesterday, just a little bit, as this virus combines with what they're putting into the vaccine.
[00:14:30.285 --> 00:14:35.027]  Remember, they can put DNA-altering ingredients into the vaccines.
[00:14:35.087 --> 00:14:39.208]  And isn't it amazing they have the vaccine ready for this at the same time the outbreak happened?
[00:14:39.228 --> 00:14:39.348]  Yep.
[00:14:39.448 --> 00:14:41.669]  And they're going to roll out mandatory vaccines.
[00:14:42.029 --> 00:14:53.755]  When this becomes a panic in America, and by the way, the media is going to cause this to be a massive, massive, you know, panic among the public, but they're going to push people to mandatory vaccines.
[00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:55.195]  They're going to have an emergency order.
[00:14:55.215 --> 00:15:06.901]  Hi, welcome back to this very solemn, very serious Sunday edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:15:08.178 --> 00:15:10.899]  And I've got so many breaking stories.
[00:15:10.979 --> 00:15:16.820]  The world government being announced, the biomedical tyranny, the UN takeover of all the major nation's healthcare systems.
[00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:25.883]  Why they're accelerating this is to cover for global martial law ahead of the financial collapse and the new worldwide digital market, the beast system that's already been announced.
[00:15:28.021 --> 00:15:59.722]   Next hour, I'm going to get into national news, picking it up, late night comics attacking millions of views on YouTube and Twitter, taking very short clips out of what I said last week, out of context, where I was showing news articles About fertility dropping, sperm counts dropping 90 plus percent, girls going into puberty at 3, 4, 5 years old from the chemicals, penis sizes shrinking all over the world wherever the globalists get control.
[00:16:00.383 --> 00:16:04.086]  It's tied into the chemicals in the water and what's in the vaccines and it's in studies.
[00:16:04.446 --> 00:16:05.567]  We showed all that.
[00:16:06.776 --> 00:16:13.942]  On the, what was it, Wednesday show, and the order went out, take that, edit it, don't show any of his proof, and then make a joke about it.
[00:16:14.322 --> 00:16:15.744]  Well, I'm going to show you the studies.
[00:16:16.244 --> 00:16:21.008]  I'm going to show you mainline news reporting on it next hour, and then play what they edited.
[00:16:21.869 --> 00:16:26.032]  They know, and they don't want you to know, and they think it's funny.
[00:16:26.533 --> 00:16:28.895]  These are sick, evil people.
[00:16:31.837 --> 00:16:35.120]  Oh, they'll tell you in the New York Times it's happening, but they won't tell you why it's happening.
[00:16:35.973 --> 00:16:37.054]  So that's coming up next hour.
[00:16:37.094 --> 00:16:39.296]  It's all part of the depopulation operation.
[00:16:39.316 --> 00:16:41.878]  But they've moved on from steroids and the rest of it.
[00:16:42.538 --> 00:16:46.221]  And feminizing men and ultra-feminizing women where they go into puberty at age 5.
[00:16:48.983 --> 00:16:54.127]  They've just moved on to genetically implanting in your cells with virus vector injections.
[00:16:55.368 --> 00:16:56.869]  We'll go over all the documents next segment.
[00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.413]  And implanting something that basically gives you cancer and kills you.
[00:17:02.952 --> 00:17:07.294]  And the record still bursts of babies of mothers that got injected with this in the months before.
[00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:10.196]  With bloody sores all over them and the blood clots and the heart attacks.
[00:17:10.376 --> 00:17:12.337]  And now they admit these shots can cause that.
[00:17:12.597 --> 00:17:13.258]  And it's not rare.
[00:17:13.678 --> 00:17:18.500]  So this is all happening and they're just normalizing killing everybody while they pose as the saviors.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:25.124]  But I'm going to go back to the 18-minute synopsis that our great archivist put together in three hours.
[00:17:26.845 --> 00:17:40.451]   On Thursday, I said I want to get a compilation together of where I laid out, with the documents and the science, the new lockdowns, the new viruses they would release.
[00:17:40.932 --> 00:17:43.596]  Specifically, we got into smallpox, monkeypox.
[00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:55.327]  It was an 18-minute synopsis of shows going back to January of 2020, over two years ago, specifically laying out exactly what's happening.
[00:17:55.367 --> 00:17:56.068]  How do I do that?
[00:17:56.628 --> 00:17:58.550]  If you have that answer, you'll have the answer.
[00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:01.754]  I'm not here with this knowledge, trying to use it for my own gain.
[00:18:01.794 --> 00:18:02.475]  Believe me, I have a...
[00:18:03.277 --> 00:18:04.238]  A rule, I don't do that.
[00:18:04.739 --> 00:18:08.722]  I knew Joe Rogan was going to Spotify six months before he did, but nobody else knew.
[00:18:08.762 --> 00:18:11.305]  He asked what I thought, you know, what was going on, should he do it?
[00:18:12.085 --> 00:18:17.250]  And I didn't invest in Spotify, didn't tell my wife, didn't tell my family, didn't tell anybody.
[00:18:18.791 --> 00:18:21.354]  Could have made hundreds of millions of dollars insider trading on that.
[00:18:21.554 --> 00:18:25.698]  The stock went up 40-something percent in the month after he made the announcement.
[00:18:26.471 --> 00:18:28.873]  Because I don't use this knowledge for things like that.
[00:18:29.093 --> 00:18:31.694]  It's not bad if you know stuff like that and you used it.
[00:18:32.055 --> 00:18:41.380]  It's that I have a rule that I can't be like Congress that knows what they're going to pass and what they're going to fund and what they're going to do, and then they use it for their own personal gain and say they're allowed to insider trade.
[00:18:41.821 --> 00:18:43.042]  When they do it, it's insider trading.
[00:18:43.262 --> 00:18:45.983]  If I have information and use it, it's not.
[00:18:46.003 --> 00:18:47.604]  But I still don't do it.
[00:18:47.905 --> 00:18:49.185]  Because I want to be pure.
[00:18:49.205 --> 00:18:52.848]  I own no stock, no bonds, nothing.
[00:18:54.542 --> 00:18:56.984]  Even though I could use all this knowledge to be a billionaire.
[00:18:59.246 --> 00:19:00.847]  Because that's what the Holy Spirit tells me to do.
[00:19:01.187 --> 00:19:04.870]  So I can be absolutely only beholden to God and you.
[00:19:06.772 --> 00:19:10.474]  This 18-minute compilation is beyond bombshell.
[00:19:11.515 --> 00:19:16.319]  I'm gonna have it added to the live show feed today with the live show headline up there.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:22.784]  Dealing with Lockdown 2 and what they're planning on economic collapse that we're already in the middle of.
[00:19:24.198 --> 00:19:25.018]  But I'm going to play now.
[00:19:25.999 --> 00:19:26.719]  Going out to break.
[00:19:27.599 --> 00:19:29.560]  Just five minutes of this.
[00:19:30.461 --> 00:19:31.581]  Four and a half minutes of this.
[00:19:32.461 --> 00:19:35.323]  So you will then go to Band.Video, but you can't share that URL.
[00:19:35.443 --> 00:19:36.023]  They're blocking it.
[00:19:37.563 --> 00:19:38.964]  On Twitter and Facebook, the rest of it.
[00:19:40.004 --> 00:19:41.785]  We'll give you a new URL when we come back.
[00:19:42.506 --> 00:19:45.267]  We had BattlePlan.News, now they're blocking that, but we have a new one.
[00:19:46.087 --> 00:19:48.508]  We'll put it up on screen in a moment and you can see it for yourself.
[00:19:50.409 --> 00:19:50.529]  And...
[00:19:51.684 --> 00:19:53.605]  They're trying to keep you from this information.
[00:19:53.665 --> 00:19:53.905]  Why?
[00:19:53.965 --> 00:19:55.727]  Because if you know this, they can't destroy you.
[00:19:57.528 --> 00:20:03.332]  They've stolen the world through fraud, they've taken over, and now they want you and myself and everybody else out of the way.
[00:20:03.692 --> 00:20:04.632]  We're useless eaters.
[00:20:04.672 --> 00:20:06.173]  We're non-essential.
[00:20:06.874 --> 00:20:09.295]  So ladies and gentlemen, here's a little bit more from this clip.
[00:20:09.856 --> 00:20:10.796]  It's on Bandot Video.
[00:20:10.816 --> 00:20:12.738]  We're going to get the featured video on Bandot Video.
[00:20:13.078 --> 00:20:14.819]  Alex Jones predicted the monkeypox outbreak.
[00:20:14.859 --> 00:20:15.820]  Learn what's coming next.
[00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:16.800]  From 27 months ago.
[00:20:20.257 --> 00:20:20.878]  26 months ago.
[00:20:21.639 --> 00:20:24.342]  No, no, 28 months ago.
[00:20:25.443 --> 00:20:27.765]  Learn what's coming next from two plus years ago.
[00:20:28.306 --> 00:20:29.728]  From then, learn what's coming next.
[00:20:29.748 --> 00:20:33.111]  Because everything I said has come true to a point, now the rest is happening.
[00:20:34.253 --> 00:20:35.674]  Only 100,000 views on that video.
[00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:36.795]  It needs 50 million.
[00:20:38.017 --> 00:20:38.958]  Here's a few more minutes of it.
[00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:48.654]  Remember, they can put DNA-altering ingredients into the vaccines, and isn't it amazing they have the vaccine ready for this at the same time the outbreak happened?
[00:20:48.854 --> 00:20:51.095]  And they're going to roll out mandatory vaccines.
[00:20:51.455 --> 00:21:03.180]  When this becomes a panic in America, and by the way, the media is going to cause this to be a massive, massive panic among the public, but they're going to push people to mandatory vaccines.
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.621]  They're going to have an emergency order.
[00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:06.690]  Maybe by the president.
[00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:07.231]  I don't know.
[00:21:07.251 --> 00:21:08.911]  I don't know if he's going to stop this.
[00:21:09.131 --> 00:21:10.752]  He's not stopping the tech censorship.
[00:21:10.772 --> 00:21:11.652]  I don't know what he's going to do.
[00:21:12.012 --> 00:21:17.594]  But they're going to have mandatory vaccines and the vaccines will be the second half of the binary weapon.
[00:21:18.134 --> 00:21:22.075]  This is euthanasia via vaccination.
[00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:23.736]  I don't believe this is the big one.
[00:21:24.622 --> 00:21:37.289]  They need to have a virus that's deadly but not ultra deadly to get everybody under world government, everybody used to being forcibly inoculated in quarantines and shutdowns, and these systems of total control.
[00:21:38.109 --> 00:21:42.471]  The globalists are testing right now our response to see if they can lock us down.
[00:21:42.491 --> 00:21:49.795]  And then if we lock down properly, then they're going to release the real bio version that'll then start wiping out even more.
[00:21:50.035 --> 00:21:52.717]  So this is a test for the global depopulation operation.
[00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:57.992]  It's 2020, and they're gearing up to exterminate you and your family.
[00:21:58.612 --> 00:22:00.354]  It came out of Wuhan.
[00:22:01.254 --> 00:22:03.736]  China incubated this and then deployed it worldwide.
[00:22:04.363 --> 00:22:05.043]  Well, absolutely.
[00:22:05.103 --> 00:22:05.823]  And they're not done.
[00:22:06.003 --> 00:22:07.324]  This is just the first wave.
[00:22:07.364 --> 00:22:09.324]  So, you hinted at this earlier.
[00:22:09.344 --> 00:22:11.625]  This is a softening up phase for America.
[00:22:12.065 --> 00:22:15.186]  There is a much more virulent strain that will be released.
[00:22:15.246 --> 00:22:17.166]  And it's an opening salvo of a larger role.
[00:22:17.206 --> 00:22:20.827]  And it really all crystallized for me doing deep research last night, this morning, and talking to you.
[00:22:20.887 --> 00:22:24.108]  And I think you just picked up where I was going without me even telling you.
[00:22:24.128 --> 00:22:30.070]  I think you're starting to concur with me as we brainstorm here that this is an opening salvo in something much larger.
[00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:31.231]  Absolutely it is.
[00:22:31.931 --> 00:22:32.592]  There's no question.
[00:22:32.612 --> 00:22:35.034]  And it depends on how Trump responds to this.
[00:22:35.634 --> 00:22:37.996]  And there's also evidence that it's also a binary weapon.
[00:22:38.536 --> 00:22:41.899]  That you've got to have other things in the environment for it to be triggered.
[00:22:42.099 --> 00:22:43.540]  Now remember, this will blow over.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.342]  It'll have hundreds of thousands of deaths, whatever.
[00:22:46.723 --> 00:22:50.065]  But you'll be trained to lock down and then the next thing comes in a year or two.
[00:22:50.365 --> 00:22:51.086]  And then the next one.
[00:22:51.146 --> 00:22:52.467]  And then one hits that's billions.
[00:22:52.707 --> 00:22:54.368]  And you all sit in your houses and die.
[00:22:54.389 --> 00:22:59.913]  Everybody just better button up and realize it's not the virus you've got to worry about.
[00:23:01.946 --> 00:23:07.310]  But you better be concerned because the virus is the cover for what's coming next.
[00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:17.156]  Look, I've told you this for several years, and back in the fall, we put up every day, the man in a space suit at a national park, at Yosemite National Park.
[00:23:18.797 --> 00:23:19.958]  And I said, that's the future.
[00:23:19.978 --> 00:23:22.480]  They're going to make it impossible to live normally on this planet.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:28.404]  They're going to have limited bioweapon releases at first that get us to then take vaccines that remove our immunity.
[00:23:28.864 --> 00:23:30.905]  Oh, I can tell you, this is the drill.
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.844]  And then we go on to specifically lay out that they're going to release the monkeypox.
[00:23:36.864 --> 00:23:37.485]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:37.505 --> 00:23:37.945]  Stay with us.
[00:23:38.005 --> 00:23:38.986]  Infowars.com.
[00:23:39.286 --> 00:23:40.227]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:23:40.307 --> 00:23:58.586]  Get this video out if you want to stop these people.
[00:23:59.156 --> 00:24:00.617]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:24:00.857 --> 00:24:02.018]  Well, so does he.
[00:24:02.538 --> 00:24:06.981]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24:07.061 --> 00:24:10.244]  It's an emergency Sunday broadcast.
[00:24:10.304 --> 00:24:11.605]  New global lockdowns imminent.
[00:24:11.665 --> 00:24:17.009]  A smokescreen for impending worldwide financial collapse announcement of the New World Order.
[00:24:19.741 --> 00:24:41.332]  We're laying out exclusive whistleblower information confirming that so-called COVID vaccines permanently mutate the human genome by implanting sterilization and cancer-causing spike proteins into the human genome system, literally implanting a kill switch in future generations.
[00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:46.403]  It is all coming up here today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:46.723 --> 00:24:59.629]  But I want to put on screen for people, one more time if we can, the video that I just played a few excerpts of, that is a compilation of clips in the last almost two and a half years, laying out what is now unfolding.
[00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:03.231]  Alex Jones predicted the monkeypox outbreak.
[00:25:03.571 --> 00:25:08.834]  But you can't share Bandot video on most platforms because of the censors and the Ministry of Truth.
[00:25:10.578 --> 00:25:14.919]  You go to directlyban.video and use your email or your text message or your word of mouth.
[00:25:15.419 --> 00:25:17.340]  Or you can also use the new URL.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.120]  We had battleplan.news for a few months.
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:20.340]  They've now banned that.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:22.941]  The new URL they might ban in a week or six months.
[00:25:22.961 --> 00:25:23.521]  We don't know.
[00:25:23.981 --> 00:25:25.182]  Theinfowar.tv.
[00:25:25.762 --> 00:25:28.682]  It's right up there in the corner of the screen.
[00:25:28.702 --> 00:25:29.563]  You can see it right there.
[00:25:30.043 --> 00:25:30.923]  The InfoWar.
[00:25:32.057 --> 00:25:35.018]  One word, TheInfoWar.tv.
[00:25:35.118 --> 00:25:35.638]  There it is.
[00:25:36.099 --> 00:25:36.899]  Share that everywhere.
[00:25:36.979 --> 00:25:39.160]  This is a literal information war.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.901]  They cannot win unless they can censor us and control us.
[00:25:43.282 --> 00:25:45.102]  The last two and a half years was a beta test.
[00:25:45.482 --> 00:25:48.624]  Now they're going into their full operation against everybody.
[00:25:49.604 --> 00:25:49.904]  Okay.
[00:25:52.525 --> 00:25:53.926]  Look at all these articles laid out here.
[00:25:54.872 --> 00:25:57.575]  This is not a prop to make it look like I've got a bunch of research.
[00:25:57.615 --> 00:25:59.577]  We actually have gone over these articles.
[00:25:59.678 --> 00:26:04.663]  Every one of these stacks is incredibly important, and I'm going to start plowing through them right now.
[00:26:09.108 --> 00:26:11.091]  The good news is people have figured this out.
[00:26:12.128 --> 00:26:26.617]  My inbox is full, my phone is ringing off the hook, you can go to Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, not just Gab, not just Rumble, not just InfoWars.com, but you can go anywhere and it's just flooded with people going, look at this timeline!
[00:26:26.957 --> 00:26:51.330]   And people have done all these amazing timelines that have links to the announcements and the documents from the Davos Group, from the UN, from Bill Gates, from the Carnegie Endowment, from the Rockefeller Foundation, where they war game Specifically, monkeypox, and then martial law being brought in.
[00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:54.091]  So you wonder what came after COVID when you're not scared of that anymore?
[00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:56.371]  Well, here comes the monkeypox.
[00:26:56.931 --> 00:27:01.873]  And many of the symptoms of monkeypox is exactly what these so-called vaccines cause.
[00:27:03.171 --> 00:27:06.315]  All sorts of blisters and red bloody spots all over your body.
[00:27:06.355 --> 00:27:06.955]  You know that.
[00:27:07.356 --> 00:27:10.540]  They admit that that is all going on.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:17.087]  So now Monkey Pops is in 83 countries magically and they don't know how it happened.
[00:27:17.147 --> 00:27:19.210]  Well, we do, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:19.991 --> 00:27:21.072]  I'm going to show you articles.
[00:27:21.112 --> 00:27:21.813]  I'm going to move quick.
[00:27:22.825 --> 00:27:24.387]  Later this will be archived at Bandai Video.
[00:27:24.407 --> 00:27:26.829]  You can pause the video, write it down, look it up, read it.
[00:27:27.169 --> 00:27:29.891]  I'd spend a lot of time on this because it's about to lock you down.
[00:27:29.911 --> 00:27:31.433]  It's about to make you non-essential.
[00:27:31.473 --> 00:27:32.514]  It's about to bankrupt you.
[00:27:32.634 --> 00:27:35.777]  And then they'll have the next wave that kills us.
[00:27:36.998 --> 00:27:37.518]  Or more of us.
[00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:38.859]  This is a plan.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.441]  Remember, I'm not just saying it now.
[00:27:40.921 --> 00:27:43.143]  Not just tailoring what's currently happening to my view.
[00:27:43.444 --> 00:27:45.646]  We already predicted it with our own documents.
[00:27:45.966 --> 00:27:46.907]  Everything that's happening now.
[00:27:48.655 --> 00:27:49.295]  Key article.
[00:27:49.996 --> 00:27:55.359]  Learn how Bill Gates knew about the monkeypox outbreak and the new global pandemic lockdown.
[00:27:55.759 --> 00:27:56.220]  Go read it.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.460]  It's on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.041]  See the videos.
[00:27:58.381 --> 00:27:59.682]  Everything we say, we have a clip.
[00:28:00.102 --> 00:28:00.802]  We have a document.
[00:28:00.982 --> 00:28:02.023]  Everything we say!
[00:28:03.604 --> 00:28:06.005]  Another key report by Kellan McBrain, InfoWars.com.
[00:28:06.806 --> 00:28:17.953]  2021 WHO and Gates Foundation exercise portrayed global monkeypox pandemic killing millions used to bring in a UN treaty to take over national sovereignty and all of our health care.
[00:28:18.792 --> 00:28:19.532]  It's all there.
[00:28:20.393 --> 00:28:24.634]  Again, if you're planning a bio attack, your own employees can spy on you.
[00:28:24.674 --> 00:28:25.575]  They can blackmail you.
[00:28:25.615 --> 00:28:27.115]  They can expose you.
[00:28:28.096 --> 00:28:32.617]  But if it's all done as a drill and a tabletop exercise, well, it's just a drill.
[00:28:33.318 --> 00:28:36.519]  Oh, that's fiction that I was planning to rob the bank.
[00:28:36.779 --> 00:28:37.319]  Doesn't matter.
[00:28:37.339 --> 00:28:39.580]  The fiction matches what happened in the bank robbery.
[00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.001]  See how it works?
[00:28:41.921 --> 00:28:44.462]  Very important report on InfoWars.com.
[00:28:44.842 --> 00:28:46.683]  I suggest you share it if you want to live.
[00:28:48.157 --> 00:28:49.118]  Bombshell report!
[00:28:49.198 --> 00:28:52.820]  Monkeypox appears to be lab-streamed with unknown characteristics.
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:53.861]  Of course they souped it up.
[00:28:54.201 --> 00:28:55.542]  Says CDC source.
[00:28:55.802 --> 00:28:56.743]  ECD source.
[00:28:57.023 --> 00:28:58.784]  Go read that article in fullwords.com.
[00:28:59.185 --> 00:28:59.705]  Jamie White.
[00:29:01.106 --> 00:29:02.067]  And right on time.
[00:29:02.847 --> 00:29:04.268]  Told you over a week ago they'd do this.
[00:29:04.748 --> 00:29:07.210]  Belgium begins monkeypox quarantines.
[00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:10.272]  Biden warns everybody should be concerned.
[00:29:10.973 --> 00:29:15.536]  Anybody with a blister, anything, oh, it's not a fever blister, it's monkeypox, you're locked up.
[00:29:16.294 --> 00:29:19.196]  They don't, of course, tell you there's a bunch of drugs that totally cure it in hours.
[00:29:19.717 --> 00:29:23.800]  World Health Organization warns monkeypox could accelerate during the summer.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.261]  Oh, perfect times for the midterms.
[00:29:25.702 --> 00:29:27.203]  CDC alerts U.S.
[00:29:27.223 --> 00:29:30.165]  doctors as virus reaches 13 countries.
[00:29:31.706 --> 00:29:35.369]  Belgium becomes first country to introduce compulsory monkeypox quarantine.
[00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:39.873]  Bolsonaro of Brazil rejects WHO's pandemic treaty.
[00:29:39.933 --> 00:29:42.095]  Brazil is autonomous.
[00:29:42.435 --> 00:29:42.955]  Beautiful.
[00:29:43.376 --> 00:29:44.777]  We need more of that.
[00:29:46.178 --> 00:29:48.982]  Monkeypox, war games, and vaccine side effects.
[00:29:49.563 --> 00:29:50.504]  Very important.
[00:29:50.985 --> 00:29:56.473]  Five-minute report will air next segment that is so critical.
[00:29:57.855 --> 00:30:04.141]   Archbishop Vigiano warns nations of World Health Organization's UN
[00:30:04.141 --> 00:30:10.181]   pandemic treaty power grab yielding sovereignty is considered the crime of high treason.
[00:30:10.181 --> 00:30:11.621]  And that's what the new world order is.
[00:30:11.621 --> 00:30:16.181]   Then, of course, we played the clips on Friday, but Bill Gates in November of 2021 said it's
[00:30:16.181 --> 00:30:17.301]  imminent.
[00:30:17.301 --> 00:30:18.541]  The monkey pox is coming.
[00:30:18.541 --> 00:30:19.541]  Give up all your rights.
[00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:20.541]  He will save you.
[00:30:20.541 --> 00:30:24.061]   And Biden already bought the monkey pox vaccine six months ago.
[00:30:24.061 --> 00:30:25.740]  It was delivered this week.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:31.981]  I mean, total, complete, absolute coordination.
[00:30:31.981 --> 00:30:38.341]   Biden on monkey pox outbreak should concern everybody as health experts are baffled.
[00:30:38.341 --> 00:30:41.180]  How could it pop up in 83 countries overnight?
[00:30:41.729 --> 00:30:42.949]  Magically, no one knows.
[00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:46.271]  Oh, now it's sex, just like HIV.
[00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:47.212]  No, it's the injections.
[00:30:47.672 --> 00:30:48.833]  Monkeypox goes global.
[00:30:48.873 --> 00:30:50.354]  Why scientists are on alert?
[00:30:52.284 --> 00:30:55.566]  Meanwhile, Judge orders Biden to keep Title 42 barrier.
[00:30:56.107 --> 00:31:01.290]  All it is, is a limited Ellis Island check if they catch you, to make sure you don't have diseases.
[00:31:02.431 --> 00:31:07.374]  Biden was going to waive that, but New York, LA and others are re-implementing masks.
[00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:10.550]  Getting ready for lockdowns.
[00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:21.215]  When you're in the country, oh, you can't go to mass gatherings, they're saying already, but the border, it stays wide open, but a judge orders Biden to keep Title 42 barrier.
[00:31:22.175 --> 00:31:32.360]  And I mentioned this is happening all over the world, but feds consider, that's the feds in Canada, digital identity and facial recognition for air travel on the back of COVID-19.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.120]  Now, monkeypox.
[00:31:33.621 --> 00:31:35.301]  Okay, they're not scared of COVID now?
[00:31:35.341 --> 00:31:36.442]  Well, let's give them monkeypox.
[00:31:36.722 --> 00:31:38.163]  They'll accept the global ID.
[00:31:39.653 --> 00:31:45.735]  We've got a bunch of slides and a bunch of documents that go through all this and lay it out.
[00:31:46.315 --> 00:31:53.737]  But Marco Rubio came out and said, how do we tell American citizens if you test positive for anything, you can't enter your own country?
[00:31:53.777 --> 00:32:01.519]  But if you are arriving illegally, whether you test positive or not, you say the magic words and you get in to the United States.
[00:32:02.219 --> 00:32:11.026]  Sweden now joins other countries in classifying monkeypox as a disease dangerous to public health, allowing the government to impose measures and restrictions to stop the spread of infection.
[00:32:11.326 --> 00:32:18.372]  Kills maybe one out of a thousand, but the UN only counts those that almost died or died in their statistics, so it's one out of ten.
[00:32:18.672 --> 00:32:23.156]  More fraud like we've seen over and over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:32:23.917 --> 00:32:27.880]  So this is quite a time to be alive.
[00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.362]  I can't believe it's monkeypox season already.
[00:32:31.627 --> 00:32:33.708]  I still have my Ukraine decorations up.
[00:32:34.248 --> 00:32:34.728]  That's right.
[00:32:35.928 --> 00:32:39.529]  And then, of course, we have the head of Pfizer saying, imagine the compliance.
[00:32:39.969 --> 00:32:50.312]  Pfizer CEO pitches Dabos Elite on Wi-Fi microchip swallowable vaccines that are live vaccines and where it has a chip in the pill to make sure you took it.
[00:32:51.801 --> 00:32:53.902]  And it goes on from there.
[00:32:53.922 --> 00:32:55.903]  Remember what Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[00:32:55.943 --> 00:32:56.183]  said?
[00:32:56.563 --> 00:32:58.924]  The CDC is not an independent agency.
[00:32:59.484 --> 00:33:00.664]  It's a vaccine company.
[00:33:00.684 --> 00:33:02.865]  The CDC owns over 20 vaccine patents.
[00:33:03.285 --> 00:33:08.687]  It sells about $4.6 billion of vaccines every single year.
[00:33:09.828 --> 00:33:14.330]  And there's a breakdown how they laid out the whole timeline and prepared it.
[00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:14.790]  All right.
[00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:16.290]  All right.
[00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:17.631]  We've got so much to cover.
[00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:28.837]  When we return, and how they're recycling the same propaganda from shingles caused by these so-called vaccines, even using the same photos to say that it's being caused by monkeypox.
[00:33:29.137 --> 00:33:30.138]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.521]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:35.841 --> 00:33:41.041]   It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:41.041 --> 00:33:51.041]   In 1980, smallpox was declared eradicated by the World Health Assembly.
[00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:54.742]  After 9-11, however, concerns over bioterrorism attacks increased.
[00:33:55.223 --> 00:34:13.454]  We also face a new threat that the next epidemic has a good chance of originating on a computer screen of a terrorist intent on using genetic engineering to create a synthetic version of the smallpox virus or a contagious and highly deadly strain of flu.
[00:34:14.508 --> 00:34:15.528]  and have since led the U.S.
[00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:21.571]  FDA to fully approve two brand new smallpox vaccines, ACAM2000 and JYNNEOS.
[00:34:22.392 --> 00:34:22.872]  The U.S.
[00:34:22.932 --> 00:34:34.517]  national stockpile also includes a third vaccine for smallpox called APSV, an investigational replication-competent vaccine which could potentially be made available under emergency authorization.
[00:34:35.577 --> 00:34:37.959]  ACAM2000 was approved by the FDA in 2007.
[00:34:39.847 --> 00:34:44.033]  As of 2019, ACAM has been limited for use primarily in U.S.
[00:34:44.073 --> 00:34:53.024]  military and DoD personnel due to the safety risks, which include becoming infected with the vaccine zone virus, vaccine shedding, and death.
[00:34:53.405 --> 00:34:57.070]  Package insert also includes a number of warnings and precautions.
[00:34:58.042 --> 00:35:07.025]  Including a black box warning for the serious adverse events which are listed here and which we'll describe in a little bit more detail in a further slide.
[00:35:07.265 --> 00:35:14.807]  The CDC's own website also states that the risk of ACAM side effects and household contacts is the same as those for the vaccine recipient.
[00:35:15.747 --> 00:35:17.307]  Another pandemic of the vaccinated.
[00:35:17.327 --> 00:35:23.309]  Now let's move on to JYNNEOS, the vaccine most recently approved for both smallpox and monkeypox.
[00:35:24.147 --> 00:35:27.330]  We look here to the FDA's Biologics License Application Review.
[00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:35.817]  In this 213-page memorandum, you'll find that its effectiveness was only inferred using the immunobridging process to compare it with ACAM.
[00:35:36.798 --> 00:35:43.183]  As of 2019, it is only approved for those who are determined to be at high risk of either smallpox or monkeypox.
[00:35:44.124 --> 00:35:48.528]  This vaccine also goes by the name of Infinex in Europe and Infimune in Canada.
[00:35:49.631 --> 00:35:52.236]  In addition to the vaccines, both the U.S.
[00:35:52.256 --> 00:35:52.677]  and U.K.
[00:35:52.697 --> 00:35:58.027]  governments have been preparing for a monkeypox outbreak using tabletop scenario war games, similar to Event 201.
[00:35:59.531 --> 00:36:07.676]  The Nuclear Threat Initiative, or NTI, prepared for such an event in the spring of 2021 using a genetically modified monkeypox scenario.
[00:36:08.257 --> 00:36:11.499]  This event even included some of the same players from Event 201.
[00:36:12.279 --> 00:36:22.686]  This year's NTI tabletop exercise featured a bioweapons attack against cattle, which would prepare them for, let's say, a virus outbreak at the new BSL-4 Agriculture Lab in Kansas.
[00:36:23.803 --> 00:36:31.229]  The UK Ministry of Defence recently used Conductor to play out how they would react to Russian disinformation during a monkeypox outbreak.
[00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:46.742]  Conductor is an extremely advanced crisis simulation software used by the UK government and even the United Nations, among others, to create and test different scenarios including pandemics, cyberattacks, earthquakes, and specifically monkeypox outbreaks.
[00:36:48.083 --> 00:36:52.506]  The software is finely tuned to resemble social media, including Facebook and Twitter.
[00:36:53.607 --> 00:36:58.531]  This particular wargame can be found on the UK's professional wargaming site, Connections UK.
[00:36:59.531 --> 00:37:06.837]  Interestingly, but possibly unrelated, the United States wargaming site includes training on how to target human trust on social media.
[00:37:07.557 --> 00:37:15.363]  It's like you don't really need that expensive virus if you can put together a couple of really, really good Twitter handles and Facebook pages.
[00:37:16.192 --> 00:37:17.753]  What might our governments be preparing for?
[00:37:18.573 --> 00:37:19.594]  Or is it already here?
[00:37:21.675 --> 00:37:26.598]  Say, okay, what if a bioterrorist brought smallpox to 10 airports?
[00:37:26.918 --> 00:37:29.940]  You know, how would the world respond to that?
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:33.922]  Okay, Gabe, as if we don't have enough to worry about.
[00:37:33.962 --> 00:37:37.484]  Now we're hearing about the arrival of this other viral disease.
[00:37:37.985 --> 00:37:39.626]  It's called monkeypox.
[00:37:40.066 --> 00:37:44.148]  The number of confirmed or suspected cases of monkeypox worldwide is now 106.
[00:37:45.629 --> 00:37:54.057]  What the heck is monkeypox and do we actually need to worry about this?
[00:37:54.337 --> 00:37:59.562]  And in fact the questions right now, Ankita, are what is this disease and why should we in India worry?
[00:38:00.483 --> 00:38:10.512]  A very rare virus to find outside West Africa, but what we've seen in the last couple of weeks is that more cases have occurred than has been the case historically for a long, long time.
[00:38:14.566 --> 00:38:16.468]  The video's on Band.Video.
[00:38:16.488 --> 00:38:17.608]  It's on the front page.
[00:38:17.708 --> 00:38:19.910]  A very powerful contributor to Band.Video.
[00:38:21.071 --> 00:38:21.691]  Deep State.
[00:38:22.772 --> 00:38:25.454]  Monkeypox, war games, and vaccine side effects.
[00:38:26.335 --> 00:38:29.617]  And it, in five minutes, does a great job, but scratches the surface.
[00:38:30.377 --> 00:38:32.339]  That's all you can do in five minutes, but excellent job.
[00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:37.402]  So, this is all like clockwork.
[00:38:37.422 --> 00:38:39.984]  They have to pre-prepare all this to get the bureaucracy ready.
[00:38:40.024 --> 00:38:41.846]  They hide it in plain view with war games.
[00:38:42.605 --> 00:38:45.126]  Because openly planning it is the death penalty.
[00:38:45.646 --> 00:38:46.346]  And then they launch it.
[00:38:47.166 --> 00:38:48.306]  They launch COVID-19.
[00:38:48.346 --> 00:38:49.586]  They launch the poison shots.
[00:38:50.387 --> 00:38:50.987]  They did it all.
[00:38:51.527 --> 00:38:53.807]  And that's where we are in the year 2022.
[00:38:56.228 --> 00:38:59.689]  And again, I'm going to say this to people that serve the system and make jokes about things.
[00:38:59.709 --> 00:39:01.409]  We're going to be covering this at the start of the next hour.
[00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:04.330]  You're lying to yourself.
[00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:05.990]  You can make jokes.
[00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:07.590]  You can get promoted on social media.
[00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.251]  You can get a pat on the head by the system.
[00:39:09.671 --> 00:39:10.531]  Maybe even some money.
[00:39:11.724 --> 00:39:26.171]  A lot of people, but you're signing on to stuff that makes Hitler, Stalin, Mao Zedong, Genghis Khan and every other horrible mass murdering psychopath look like an amateur.
[00:39:27.392 --> 00:39:29.312]  You do not want to be part of this.
[00:39:29.853 --> 00:39:32.813]  You do not want to sign on to this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:32.813 --> 00:39:41.132]  I'm going to tell you the rest of the story.
[00:39:41.132 --> 00:39:51.133]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:39:42.185 --> 00:39:42.905]  In the second hour.
[00:39:42.945 --> 00:39:47.388]  And I'm asking the millions of people tuned in now to realize the power you have.
[00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:54.792]  And if you don't exercise that power, you are aiding and abetting the people that are going to destroy our lives.
[00:39:55.313 --> 00:39:56.713]  And I don't say that as a guilt trip.
[00:39:57.114 --> 00:40:05.538]  I'm telling you that I look in the mirror every day and I know my faults and I know my laziness and I know my issues.
[00:40:06.219 --> 00:40:10.462]   Nobody wants to go hiking and fishing and Love making more than me.
[00:40:10.522 --> 00:40:14.665]  Nobody wants to just sit back on a riverbank and drink a 12-pack of beer more than me.
[00:40:15.005 --> 00:40:15.585]  But you know what?
[00:40:15.766 --> 00:40:21.329]  I can't do it because my children and their children's future will be destroyed.
[00:40:22.831 --> 00:40:28.755]  Nobody wants to go to an Astros game or a Dallas Cowboys game as much as me.
[00:40:29.195 --> 00:40:32.938]  I grew up a sports head, but it's a diversion.
[00:40:34.036 --> 00:40:42.099]  My energy has to be put into this and we have to resist this because this is real and you're not going to have to wait and see if Alex Jones is right anymore.
[00:40:42.499 --> 00:40:44.260]  You're now living this.
[00:40:48.821 --> 00:40:53.623]  You know, I grew up being told all about this.
[00:40:54.003 --> 00:40:59.965]  And when I was like eight years old, visiting my mother's father and my grandmother here in Austin, grew up in Dallas.
[00:41:01.328 --> 00:41:05.792]  My mother didn't talk bad about her father, but she'd say, your grandfather's very eccentric.
[00:41:06.993 --> 00:41:09.294]  No, he wasn't eccentric.
[00:41:14.218 --> 00:41:19.443]  He was German, in Dallas, in the richest area of Dallas, with a bunch of rich Germans.
[00:41:20.764 --> 00:41:21.804]  And they let him in on everything.
[00:41:26.548 --> 00:41:31.292]   And his son, Worked for the Deep State, my uncle.
[00:41:32.272 --> 00:41:32.992]  And he got out of it.
[00:41:33.432 --> 00:41:34.332]  And he told me all about it.
[00:41:36.193 --> 00:41:41.874]  But we don't need to sit here and debate whether this is going on or not.
[00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:44.535]  It's happening.
[00:41:44.515 --> 00:41:48.515]  It's punching you in the face.
[00:41:48.515 --> 00:41:57.515]  My grandfather produced secret weapons for DARPA.
[00:41:57.943 --> 00:42:01.967]  I don't know what he did specifically, because it was all secret.
[00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:15.641]  And then at about 57 years old, he freaked out, became a huge Christian, he was already Christian, and broke with it, saying the government's bad, the government's evil, it wants to kill everybody, they work for Satan.
[00:42:16.182 --> 00:42:18.182]  And that's all he would say.
[00:42:18.182 --> 00:42:24.182]  And I'm going to leave it there.
[00:42:23.793 --> 00:42:43.523]  You know, he told me a little more, and it would just be too unbelievable if I told you, but... Man, I'd hear this stuff when I was a kid, and I just like... I had Dr. McCullough here Friday, and he stopped me in the hall after we'd been on the show, and he said, we're going to eat some barbecue in there in my office.
[00:42:43.984 --> 00:42:45.464]  He said, how do you know all this stuff?
[00:42:45.504 --> 00:42:46.765]  And I said, how do I know all this stuff?
[00:42:46.805 --> 00:42:47.606]  It's all over the news.
[00:42:47.626 --> 00:42:50.167]  You know, it's going on, but just...
[00:42:51.909 --> 00:42:57.574]  People need to realize that this is not a damn game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:02.078 --> 00:43:09.565]  And all the major elites of the planet have decided to transhumanize things and try to become gods and take alchemy.
[00:43:10.566 --> 00:43:16.492]  I've got a meme here that I put in my stack and I've lost.
[00:43:19.036 --> 00:43:20.297]  But man, does it say it all.
[00:43:21.457 --> 00:43:22.217]  Can't find it now.
[00:43:22.237 --> 00:43:25.699]  I go over these hundreds of articles and I put them in stacks and can't find them.
[00:43:26.759 --> 00:43:28.220]  But just let me paraphrase it.
[00:43:30.061 --> 00:43:37.844]  What humans envisioned going back thousands of years ago, humans have now been able to do.
[00:43:38.824 --> 00:43:42.466]  And now the globalists have envisioned a nightmare they want us to live in.
[00:43:42.486 --> 00:43:52.917]   So we're going to come back next hour and look at all the other facets of the attack And what they're doing, and are we going to sit back and let them do this to our children?
[00:43:53.257 --> 00:43:54.458]  That's the big question.
[00:43:55.418 --> 00:44:01.819]  Hour number two of the Alex Jones Sunday edition, and then three and four, Owen Schroeder and myself, with Sunday Live.
[00:44:01.919 --> 00:44:04.440]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.681]  This is life and death information.
[00:44:08.652 --> 00:44:14.535]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:44:14.515 --> 00:44:20.515]  [Music]
[00:44:20.515 --> 00:44:26.515]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:44:26.515 --> 00:44:28.515]  [Music]
[00:44:28.515 --> 00:44:30.515]  This is the drill.
[00:44:30.515 --> 00:44:34.515]   We all lock ourselves down and piss all over ourselves with just a weaponized cold virus.
[00:44:34.515 --> 00:44:36.515]  They're going to release stuff that kills billions.
[00:44:37.383 --> 00:44:39.464]  And they just want you trained to stay in your house while you die.
[00:44:39.764 --> 00:44:41.625]  This is only the test bioweapon.
[00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:43.406]  The real ones are coming.
[00:44:43.426 --> 00:44:44.887]  And then the next one, they'll have another one.
[00:44:44.987 --> 00:44:47.369]  Once you've learned to lock down, the drones are in control.
[00:44:47.549 --> 00:44:48.590]  There'll be armed drones.
[00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:55.073]  The armed drones will stop people that have the plague in the future from, you know, breaking quarantine and people will cheer it like it's the Running Man.
[00:44:55.434 --> 00:44:57.215]  And then they're going to hit you with the big one.
[00:44:57.535 --> 00:44:59.156]  Weaponized airborne Ebola.
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.121]  Splice with mouse pox.
[00:45:01.201 --> 00:45:03.543]  They'll probably release an even more deadly bioweapon soon.
[00:45:03.563 --> 00:45:05.805]  I mean, we're in bad shape, folks.
[00:45:05.825 --> 00:45:06.526]  They made their move.
[00:45:06.546 --> 00:45:07.286]  They dropped the hammer.
[00:45:07.827 --> 00:45:16.875]  And all these lockdowns are beta tests for when they release the real bioweapon in the future that all of you that had the vaccine, binary weapon, won't be able to resist.
[00:45:17.435 --> 00:45:18.516]  It's all binary weapons.
[00:45:19.217 --> 00:45:33.342]   As Bill Gates said last week, I played the clip last hour, he said, Talking to Stephen Colbert, the comic that poses a newsman that now poses as our doctor, he said, oh, this is just wave one.
[00:45:33.363 --> 00:45:34.865]  The next wave's a bio-attack.
[00:45:35.426 --> 00:45:37.529]  As I've told you for years, a real bio-attack.
[00:45:38.186 --> 00:45:44.651]  This is just making sure you behave yourself, because they don't want things to get out of hand when they're really taking an axe to your ass.
[00:45:44.991 --> 00:45:46.512]  So, the globalists are in a lot of trouble.
[00:45:46.813 --> 00:45:48.894]  The problem is they're going to launch even bigger attacks now.
[00:45:49.355 --> 00:45:51.136]  What's coming next after the COVID hoax?
[00:45:51.716 --> 00:45:52.357]  Depression!
[00:45:52.557 --> 00:45:53.838]  And then more COVID hoax!
[00:45:54.298 --> 00:45:56.080]  Gates goes, well, I'm not happy about this.
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:46:01.224]  Because, see, they know it all backfired, his gloating and his predicting what he himself did.
[00:46:02.554 --> 00:46:03.274]  What his group did.
[00:46:03.294 --> 00:46:07.576]  But he goes, yeah, this is event one.
[00:46:07.817 --> 00:46:09.057]  Event two is coming.
[00:46:09.137 --> 00:46:10.418]  It's a bioweapon attack.
[00:46:10.738 --> 00:46:12.759]  He's trying to tell Colbert, hey, hey, stop it.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:18.322]  I'm not invested in all this and I'm not involved and I didn't predict it.
[00:46:18.622 --> 00:46:19.202]  Stop, stop.
[00:46:19.402 --> 00:46:21.683]  But I will tell you, the next one's going to be a lot worse.
[00:46:23.184 --> 00:46:25.125]  How many times have I told you how this works?
[00:46:25.245 --> 00:46:25.945]  It's common sense.
[00:46:26.906 --> 00:46:28.347]  They launch a stimulant they own.
[00:46:28.427 --> 00:46:31.048]  They put vaccines in you that are binary weapons that lower your immunity.
[00:46:32.782 --> 00:46:34.163]  And then they start releasing the real stuff.
[00:46:34.283 --> 00:46:35.644]  Remember what I told you the last three months?
[00:46:37.065 --> 00:46:48.733]  And for years before that, but intensely every day for three months, four months, I've told you since late January that they release a small bio-simulant that does kill people a few million, globally.
[00:46:49.634 --> 00:46:53.737]  Then once they practice the lockdown, then they'll hit you with something that kills hundreds of millions next.
[00:46:54.157 --> 00:46:55.198]  They'll claim terrorists did it.
[00:46:55.658 --> 00:46:58.360]  And then big bio-weapon attack comes after that.
[00:47:00.043 --> 00:47:02.044]  If we buy into it and submit, they'll do it the next year.
[00:47:02.144 --> 00:47:03.265]  If we resist, five years.
[00:47:03.565 --> 00:47:16.354]  They can either release a new one under the COVID-19 name, which is a very complex virus, five different viruses, or they can already know what the mutation is going to be in the future, because all the pre-programming is, the big massive death is going to come later.
[00:47:17.154 --> 00:47:28.477]   And he later went on Colbert after I said that and said, terrorists will release a bioweapon Based on COVID-19, that will be much worse very soon.
[00:47:28.497 --> 00:47:32.097]  I began giggling and laughing like only a supervillain would do.
[00:47:32.517 --> 00:47:37.458]  The best thing you can do is get to the countryside somewhere and try to dig in, because it's all just going to get worse.
[00:47:37.698 --> 00:47:46.040]  And as soon as they get everybody to accept these lockdowns and forced inoculations that lower the immunity, they're going to release mass bioweapons and kill billions of people.
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.440]  This is only phase one.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.281]   Once you've gone under lockdown for about two or three years, Then the real bioweapons get released.
[00:47:53.401 --> 00:47:54.622]  I've told you this for decades.
[00:47:55.322 --> 00:47:56.522]  Gates said it a few months ago.
[00:47:57.323 --> 00:47:58.583]  He said, this is just a drill.
[00:47:59.263 --> 00:48:00.804]  The real thing's coming from terrorists.
[00:48:01.324 --> 00:48:06.765]  And he and Colbert began to have a visual, satanic type of gleeful orgasm.
[00:48:07.185 --> 00:48:11.687]  And then once we pass this test of submission, they're gonna release even more deadly bioweapons.
[00:48:12.327 --> 00:48:27.601]   One of their plans is if we all lock down properly, if we all stay in our houses properly, and let them bankrupt us, and let them train us to be slaves, and let them censure all of us, They'll go ahead and accelerate to their final goal, which is just to release a super bio-weapon and kill 7 million people.
[00:48:27.781 --> 00:48:32.207]  This is the end of the republic, the end of the country, the end of the world as you know it.
[00:48:32.527 --> 00:48:34.310]  This is the global extermination plan.
[00:48:35.715 --> 00:48:39.459]  And now they're so far into it, I'm able to track the type it is.
[00:48:39.479 --> 00:48:44.323]  I knew they had different models to first launch test attacks, and then prepare.
[00:48:44.343 --> 00:48:47.846]  And then a few years later, launch bigger attacks, each time killing more of us.
[00:48:48.287 --> 00:48:52.030]  But they've decided to go ahead and just accelerate all the way now.
[00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:57.195]  And I would say by a year from now, they'll release a bioweapon that probably kills 4 billion people.
[00:48:58.476 --> 00:49:02.103]  So they covered up the previous attacks with new attacks that get bigger.
[00:49:02.304 --> 00:49:05.983]   And now the only way they're going to get away with these bioweapons they've launched
[00:49:05.983 --> 00:49:06.983]  is getting everybody into the...
[00:49:06.983 --> 00:49:06.983]  [Music]
[00:49:06.983 --> 00:49:21.983]  [Music]
[00:49:21.987 --> 00:49:24.249]  Run on for a long time.
[00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:27.072]  Run on for a long time.
[00:49:27.793 --> 00:49:30.175]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:49:30.756 --> 00:49:33.198]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[00:49:35.347 --> 00:49:37.690]  Go tell that long-tongue liar.
[00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:40.533]  Go and tell that midnight rider.
[00:49:41.134 --> 00:49:44.257]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter.
[00:49:44.637 --> 00:49:47.140]  Tell them that God's gonna cut them down.
[00:49:47.501 --> 00:49:50.264]  Tell them that God's gonna cut them down.
[00:49:51.005 --> 00:49:52.006]  They know they've already lost.
[00:49:55.208 --> 00:49:57.829]  That's what they're trying to take us all with them.
[00:49:58.409 --> 00:50:03.290]  Alright, we're going to hit the big issues right now.
[00:50:03.310 --> 00:50:16.733]  The confirmed chemical attacks going on to the food and water supply and electromagnetically in their own admissions and then they're counter to us telling people we can stop it.
[00:50:19.213 --> 00:50:20.514]  I don't just have all the documents.
[00:50:20.594 --> 00:50:22.434]  I don't just have all the admissions I'm about to show you.
[00:50:24.356 --> 00:50:29.155]   Here on the Alex Jones show, we start hour number two on this Sunday night, May 22nd, 2022.
[00:50:29.155 --> 00:50:40.996]  I have sources inside Big Chemical.
[00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.890]  And I looked it up.
[00:50:43.471 --> 00:51:09.968]   One of these individuals' father had the patent on a whole class of bisphenols in plastics But he said we can do another chemical process even cheaper and you shouldn't put out these plastics I invented because it causes the sterilization of men and the hyper feminization of women which makes them accelerate their aging.
[00:51:10.708 --> 00:51:15.651]  So like a 30 year old woman's 60 genetically in their ovaries.
[00:51:17.773 --> 00:51:22.707]   Every time I touch on this in the last 25 years or so.
[00:51:22.727 --> 00:51:26.975]  I've been on here 28 years, but I wasn't on it until about 25 years ago.
[00:51:26.995 --> 00:51:28.719]  I wasn't really over the target.
[00:51:32.281 --> 00:51:36.604]  They've had Stephen Colbert, they've had Jimmy Kimmel, they've had all of them.
[00:51:36.644 --> 00:51:40.967]  And then the news shows and news articles say Jones is insane.
[00:51:41.748 --> 00:51:45.490]  He says chemicals in the water lower sperm count, 90 plus percent.
[00:51:46.151 --> 00:51:49.673]  He says that it mutates boys to be quasi-feminine.
[00:51:49.933 --> 00:51:56.178]  They're not hermaphroditic, but they're like a girl in many of their cells and brain development and genitals.
[00:51:56.558 --> 00:52:00.801]  And genitals shrink, a sign of that, the hermaphroditic movement.
[00:52:03.476 --> 00:52:11.098]  They attack because this was their previous operation, but now they're just going straight to poison shots.
[00:52:11.438 --> 00:52:20.680]  They call vaccines that implant the DNA, not just of you, but your children, with a cancer-causing, blood clot-causing kill switch, and that's mainline news now.
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:28.601]  So, I'm not gonna name drop here, but I always like to give you where things came from.
[00:52:29.722 --> 00:52:34.938]   I'd forgotten about this, so I sent a prominent Talk show host!
[00:52:38.300 --> 00:53:00.206]  A clip today and I said, you know, here's these late night shows and here's these, you know, big Twitter accounts with millions of views saying I'm lying about chemicals causing penises to shrink because the media seized on that to edit that out and just not show the proof I showed last week.
[00:53:00.246 --> 00:53:01.166]  I'm about to show you again.
[00:53:01.586 --> 00:53:02.787]  And just think of the evil of that.
[00:53:02.867 --> 00:53:04.907]  They know they just saw the proof.
[00:53:05.627 --> 00:53:06.848]  London Telegraph.
[00:53:07.882 --> 00:53:13.327]  New York Times admitting it, but not telling you why it's happening, and then they just say, oh, it's not happening.
[00:53:14.308 --> 00:53:15.168]  They're Sky News.
[00:53:15.288 --> 00:53:19.272]  Human penises are shrinking because of pollution-warned scientists.
[00:53:19.932 --> 00:53:22.655]  It's a little bit more than that, and it's specific.
[00:53:24.036 --> 00:53:37.137]   So this Ron Fliposky, who makes it his job to attack us, which is fine, because the truth will come out, Alex Jones says globalists are putting chemicals in the liners of soft drink cans.
[00:53:37.337 --> 00:53:38.318]  That's like mainline news.
[00:53:38.658 --> 00:53:40.339]  That it's causing men's penises to shrink.
[00:53:42.121 --> 00:53:45.683]  That was one footnote of the mutations it's causing.
[00:53:46.584 --> 00:53:48.465]  And you can see the video right there.
[00:53:50.367 --> 00:53:53.647]  that one with a million views.
[00:53:53.647 --> 00:54:01.059]   So all we're doing is showing articles They don't show you that.
[00:54:01.499 --> 00:54:03.780]  They just go, oh, he's a discredited person we've attacked.
[00:54:04.081 --> 00:54:05.021]  Don't show the articles.
[00:54:05.441 --> 00:54:08.063]  Just show him talking about it and say it's not happening.
[00:54:08.684 --> 00:54:10.305]  Man, that's like damn evil, isn't it?
[00:54:11.646 --> 00:54:17.329]  As if this guy and Twitter and people doing this think they won't be attacked by it, or they don't think they're being affected by it.
[00:54:17.629 --> 00:54:19.591]  They pretend to themselves.
[00:54:21.345 --> 00:54:35.332]  So I'm going to show you this clip, and I'm going to show you article after article after article, and then I'm going to show you the New York Times, and then I'm going to show you best-selling scientist authors saying the same thing, but not going all the way.
[00:54:35.892 --> 00:54:37.853]  So here's the viral clip.
[00:54:39.754 --> 00:54:41.034]  Does this to humans as well.
[00:54:41.715 --> 00:54:47.417]  That's why genitals, I don't care if you're black or white, are a third the size they were of a 1960s male.
[00:54:51.988 --> 00:54:52.568]  We're sterilized.
[00:54:52.448 --> 00:54:56.208]   gave the example of you know if your daddy's Johnson was a foot long yours is
[00:54:56.208 --> 00:55:00.008]   six inches long and if yours is yours was six inches your son will be three
[00:55:00.008 --> 00:55:03.928]   inches and the one with everyone even have a penis we make jokes about that
[00:55:03.928 --> 00:55:13.208]   all day long but it's hitting a game you can say okay well who cares well we're
[00:55:13.208 --> 00:55:20.127]   sterilized and the sperm counts are down 96% but they didn't show in the articles
[00:55:20.608 --> 00:55:21.289]  They made a joke.
[00:55:21.449 --> 00:55:23.792]  Oh, Jones admits he has a small ding-dong.
[00:55:24.132 --> 00:55:26.394]  Well, I'd rather have it cut off if it saved humanity.
[00:55:26.875 --> 00:55:29.218]  But that, it becomes this big joke.
[00:55:30.179 --> 00:55:31.120]  Well, this is real.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:35.805]  And this is sterilizing the animals that drink out of the creeks and rivers.
[00:55:35.885 --> 00:55:40.050]  Just the runoff of what we're drinking and what we are eating.
[00:55:41.673 --> 00:55:50.116]  So, I'm going to go to break here in about four minutes and come back with video documents, but let's just show a few articles to all the folks making jokes over at Twitter.
[00:55:50.556 --> 00:55:53.357]  In fact, in case they can't read, I'll go ahead and highlight it.
[00:55:53.637 --> 00:55:54.777]  This is the New York Times.
[00:55:56.758 --> 00:55:57.358]  Your God.
[00:55:58.379 --> 00:56:03.140]  The everyday chemicals that might be leading us to our extinction.
[00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:08.102]  We'll play a clip of the author of this, it was on Joe Rogan, and go over it all, and we have all the documents.
[00:56:10.697 --> 00:56:11.738]  Here's the book I'm talking about.
[00:56:11.758 --> 00:56:12.678]  We'll play next segment.
[00:56:13.719 --> 00:56:14.319]  Countdown.
[00:56:17.001 --> 00:56:26.587]  How our modern world is threatening sperm counts, gathered down 96%, altering male and female reproductive development, and imperiling the future of the human race.
[00:56:29.569 --> 00:56:31.751]  And it shows the New York Times talking about it.
[00:56:33.047 --> 00:56:34.368]  Oh, then he makes another joke.
[00:56:34.768 --> 00:56:37.129]  Oh, Jones claims girls are going to puberty earlier.
[00:56:37.389 --> 00:56:38.169]  That's not true.
[00:56:38.229 --> 00:56:38.890]  He's insane.
[00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:41.731]  Even though it's a massive problem on record.
[00:56:43.812 --> 00:56:47.073]  Here's Sky TV out of the UK.
[00:56:47.553 --> 00:56:50.915]  Human penises are shrinking because of pollution, warns scientist.
[00:56:51.815 --> 00:56:58.918]  Dr. Shana Shawn has found that chemicals, she wrote the book, called phthalates, are causing human babies to be born with malformed genitals.
[00:56:59.518 --> 00:57:01.239]  But what's who cares if babies are deformed?
[00:57:02.902 --> 00:57:06.865]  Scientists say human penises are shrinking due to pollution, which they do by design.
[00:57:07.125 --> 00:57:07.826]  It's a formula.
[00:57:08.166 --> 00:57:09.627]  It's even cheaper not to do it.
[00:57:09.847 --> 00:57:10.928]  They pay more to do it.
[00:57:11.368 --> 00:57:13.029]  That's the Jerusalem Post.
[00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:20.254]  Oh, but you're not going to have Ron Flipkoski talk about that.
[00:57:20.414 --> 00:57:23.336]  He'll just edit it out and say, look, Jones is insane.
[00:57:23.356 --> 00:57:24.117]  He made it up.
[00:57:27.339 --> 00:57:27.980]  Here's another one.
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:29.401]  India Today.
[00:57:30.489 --> 00:57:32.811]  Human penises shrinking due to pollution.
[00:57:37.215 --> 00:57:37.976]  Euronews.
[00:57:38.056 --> 00:57:39.918]  Penises are shrinking because of pollution.
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:48.826]  And it goes on and on with article after article after article.
[00:57:50.047 --> 00:58:11.304]   We'll play a clip of an excerpt of the best-selling scientific book written by a doctor with all the footnotes in a minute, but just remember, I did this earlier in the week with all the proof, and on the late night comedy, and on the news shows, and on the Twitter feeds, they put out edited versions saying he made it up, because they don't want you to know.
[00:58:11.564 --> 00:58:13.845]  So remember, it also causes cancer.
[00:58:13.885 --> 00:58:15.206]  Maybe you don't want to have a penis.
[00:58:15.526 --> 00:58:18.547]  Maybe you want your daughter to go into puberty at 5 and die when she's 30 of cancer.
[00:58:19.127 --> 00:58:19.687]  That's trendy.
[00:58:19.747 --> 00:58:20.087]  I get it.
[00:58:20.327 --> 00:58:20.748]  It's awesome.
[00:58:21.488 --> 00:58:21.868]  You know, like...
[00:58:23.541 --> 00:58:25.764]  Apple runs death camps in China, but he's gay, so it's cool.
[00:58:26.585 --> 00:58:37.299]  But the point is, is that this is going on, and this is happening, and that's why they want to censor us and shut us down, so they can just murder you with all this, and not give you a chance to respond to it.
[00:58:38.442 --> 00:58:40.363]  And you'll see clips on this on the news making fun of it.
[00:58:40.863 --> 00:58:42.564]  Out of context, they won't show all those articles.
[00:58:42.984 --> 00:58:54.268]  Because again, they're murdering you, they're your enemies, they love it, they enjoy it, and they're not going to stop because they're evil people turned over to absolute corruption.
[00:58:56.549 --> 00:58:58.029]  The small penis is at least your problem.
[00:58:58.049 --> 00:58:59.690]  How about sterilization and early cancer?
[00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:00.690]  How about death?
[00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:02.970]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[00:59:02.970 --> 00:59:12.970]  [MUSIC]
[00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:22.970]  [MUSIC]
[00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:46.970]   All right, so I just showed you a stack of Jerusalem Post, Sky News, New York Times, saying sperm counts down 90%.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:48.661]  Massive cancers.
[00:59:48.741 --> 00:59:54.126]  Girls going into puberty at age 5, age 3, on average age 9, used to be age 13.
[00:59:54.847 --> 00:59:56.589]  Absolute acceleration of aging.
[00:59:57.895 --> 01:00:07.139]  You look at all the studies, the frogs, literally wanting to have sex with their male frogs so the species become extinct in Texas and in South Africa.
[01:00:07.679 --> 01:00:09.160]  All of that, and we're like, what's going on?
[01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:09.920]  It's dangerous!
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.881]  It's a countdown to human extinction!
[01:00:14.062 --> 01:00:16.563]  And their answer is, shut up.
[01:00:17.604 --> 01:00:18.344]  You're a racist.
[01:00:21.323 --> 01:00:21.963]  Think about that.
[01:00:22.043 --> 01:00:23.464]  Let that sink in.
[01:00:23.544 --> 01:00:38.313]  So, here's an excerpt, it's on Amazon.com, from Countdown, How Our Modern World is Threatening Sperm Counts, Accelerating Male and Female Reproductive Development, and Imperiling the Future of the Human Race, Human Extinction, by Dr. Shauna H. Shawn.
[01:00:39.774 --> 01:00:45.738]  Here is a clip, she did a whole Joe Rogan interview last year, because I was like pointing this out.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:49.161]  To Joe today.
[01:00:49.181 --> 01:00:50.662]  And he's like, you know about that?
[01:00:50.822 --> 01:00:51.822]  I forgot about that.
[01:00:52.102 --> 01:00:52.783]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:00:52.823 --> 01:00:57.246]  It's so prolific that it's insane.
[01:00:58.607 --> 01:01:00.268]  I'm trying to get him to cover this stuff.
[01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:02.069]  And then he's like, well, I already covered it.
[01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:05.275]  Okay, look at him saying this isn't happening.
[01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:05.956]  Here's a bunch of articles.
[01:01:05.976 --> 01:01:06.697]  Yeah, Alex, I did.
[01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:07.477]  Oh, I forgot.
[01:01:07.938 --> 01:01:09.579]  I actually listened to the interviewer, most of it.
[01:01:09.619 --> 01:01:10.420]  It's like three hours long.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:12.802]  But that's what's so crazy is it's on record.
[01:01:12.862 --> 01:01:13.362]  It's happening.
[01:01:13.823 --> 01:01:16.365]  And you've got late night comics making jokes.
[01:01:16.385 --> 01:01:17.786]  You've got all the Twitter armies.
[01:01:18.087 --> 01:01:21.169]  We're censored, so they could just put a little clip to make it sound insane.
[01:01:21.770 --> 01:01:22.891]  You should take that personal.
[01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:26.474]  And I should ask the people that are part of this, like, what's your problem?
[01:01:27.975 --> 01:01:29.917]  Like, you really think you're part of the establishment?
[01:01:29.957 --> 01:01:30.778]  You're delusional.
[01:01:33.410 --> 01:01:39.192]  And we'll give you the rest of the story after that with Bill Maher coming out saying, trans is because it's trendy.
[01:01:39.933 --> 01:01:40.873]  It's beyond trendy.
[01:01:40.973 --> 01:01:44.995]  And Disney announced today, I've got the press release.
[01:01:46.055 --> 01:01:50.356]  They said, we are going to try to get your children to not be heterosexual so they don't have children.
[01:01:50.796 --> 01:01:55.817]  We are targeting your children through toys and all the foods at the grocery store with all the stuff on it.
[01:01:56.257 --> 01:01:59.017]  It's not about somebody wanting to have sex with the same sex.
[01:01:59.057 --> 01:02:04.718]  It's about the government pushing it and demanding it as they mutate it so we don't have children.
[01:02:04.798 --> 01:02:06.419]  It's about the population.
[01:02:06.779 --> 01:02:09.759]  Here's a few minutes from the book with a great voiceover.
[01:02:09.779 --> 01:02:14.720]  The human race or that we're on the brink of extinction.
[01:02:16.138 --> 01:02:23.022]  Does the environmental emasculation of wildlife suggest that the Earth really is becoming much less habitable?
[01:02:23.042 --> 01:02:27.725]  Are we on the verge of experiencing a global existential crisis?
[01:02:29.346 --> 01:02:34.349]  These are good questions, and we don't have clear answers to them, at least not yet.
[01:02:35.189 --> 01:02:39.532]  But pieces of the puzzle are being put together, as you'll see in the chapters that follow.
[01:02:40.865 --> 01:02:55.855]  You'll learn more about the breadth of these scary declines in sperm counts and other aspects of reproductive function, as well as the factors that are likely to blame for these unfortunate effects in human beings and other species, based on scientific research.
[01:02:57.276 --> 01:02:58.397]  The following is clear.
[01:02:59.038 --> 01:03:04.762]  The current state of reproductive affairs can't continue much longer without threatening human survival.
[01:03:06.041 --> 01:03:17.388]  Current levels of sperm counts and concentrations and decreased fertility are already posing serious threats to Western populations on both ends of the human lifespan.
[01:03:18.649 --> 01:03:28.535]  Infertility is linked to an increased risk of certain diseases and earlier death in both men and women, while leading to a decrease in the number of children born over time.
[01:03:29.631 --> 01:03:36.475]  Obviously, this isn't a healthy scenario for Homo sapiens, or for other threatened or endangered species.
[01:03:37.816 --> 01:03:49.202]  Already, some countries with problematic age distributions are grappling with shrinking populations, with increasing numbers of older people being supported by fewer younger people.
[01:03:50.632 --> 01:03:52.894]  It's a fairly bleak picture, I admit.
[01:03:53.695 --> 01:04:03.165]  But it's an important one to be aware of because, unless we take steps to reverse these harmful influences, the planet's species are in grave danger.
[01:04:04.367 --> 01:04:09.012]  Right now, the important measures that might improve the situation aren't happening.
[01:04:10.339 --> 01:04:22.229]  The 2017 publication of my meta-analysis on sperm count decline in Western countries put this issue on the radar screen, grabbing headlines and television coverage around the world.
[01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:38.403]  But the findings haven't translated into committees being formed, environmental policies being changed, safer chemicals being manufactured, or other concerted efforts being made to address the suspected causes or protect our collective future.
[01:04:39.992 --> 01:04:47.918]  Some people are in denial about the reality and gravity of the issue, and others shrug it off, saying the Earth is overpopulated.
[01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:59.748]  Others acknowledge the sperm count decline and the likelihood of a stagnation or decline in global population in the near future, but even they don't engage in much more than hand-wringing.
[01:05:00.488 --> 01:05:08.955]  In some ways, the sperm count decline is akin to where global warming was 40 years ago, reported upon but denied or ignored.
[01:05:10.299 --> 01:05:23.388]  Sometime between the 2006 release of Al Gore's Oscar-winning documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, and now, the climate crisis has been accepted, at least by most people, as a real threat.
[01:05:24.309 --> 01:05:28.332]  My hope is that the same will happen with the reproductive turmoil that's upon us.
[01:05:29.573 --> 01:05:32.835]  Increasingly, scientists are in agreement on the threat.
[01:05:33.716 --> 01:05:36.498]  Now we need the public to take this issue seriously.
[01:05:38.095 --> 01:05:47.584]  As a leading researcher on reproductive health and the environment, I feel it's my duty to draw attention to these alarming changes to sexual development and function.
[01:05:48.979 --> 01:06:08.089]  My interest in the effects of environmental factors on reproductive health started in the 1980s when I investigated a cluster of miscarriages in Santa Clara County, California, a trend that was eventually tied to toxic waste from a semiconductor plant that had leaked into the community's drinking water.
[01:06:09.008 --> 01:06:22.863]  Gradually, I became increasingly interested in investigating the potential effects that environmental chemicals can have on reproductive, sexual, and gender-related development in men, women, and children.
[01:06:24.051 --> 01:06:50.667]  Over the last 30 years, I've conducted studies on everything from the origins of genital anomalies in newborns and the influence of prenatal stress on reproductive development in offspring, to the effects of many hours of TV watching on testicular function, the connection between high exposure to chemicals called phthalates and low interest in sexual activity, and many other subjects related to reproductive health.
[01:06:52.290 --> 01:07:06.541]  Reversing the various reproduction-sabotaging effects that we're living with will require fundamental changes, including sweeping modifications to the kinds and volumes of chemicals that are manufactured and pumped into the environment.
[01:07:07.642 --> 01:07:16.809]  To make this happen, significant political and economic... So there are good people in the system, good scientists, good doctors like this woman.
[01:07:17.270 --> 01:07:18.431]  We have to listen to them.
[01:07:19.059 --> 01:07:25.123]  We have to understand and not make jokes on late night comedy or on Twitter and edit out what we've said.
[01:07:25.183 --> 01:07:25.743]  So watch.
[01:07:25.763 --> 01:07:30.065]  They'll edit this because they love it and make it look foolish because they love death.
[01:07:30.966 --> 01:07:32.927]  And they're literally killing us.
[01:07:32.987 --> 01:07:33.928]  It's another form of murder.
[01:07:33.968 --> 01:07:34.428]  It's worse.
[01:07:34.768 --> 01:07:35.769]  You don't just kill the person.
[01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:36.669]  You kill their children.
[01:07:36.689 --> 01:07:37.550]  You kill their genetics.
[01:07:37.890 --> 01:07:38.971]  You kill their whole future.
[01:07:39.031 --> 01:07:42.573]  It's called genocide of the human species.
[01:07:42.673 --> 01:07:44.534]  It's called Countdown to Extinction.
[01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:46.535]  We'll be right back with more big breaking news.
[01:07:46.555 --> 01:07:46.975]  Stay with us.
[01:07:47.255 --> 01:07:47.856]  Infowars.com.
[01:07:51.499 --> 01:08:00.621]  Albert Bourla.
[01:08:00.641 --> 01:08:04.822]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[01:08:05.743 --> 01:08:09.684]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:08:11.364 --> 01:08:18.626]  So Albert Bourla of Pfizer is up on TV saying, oh, we're going to make you take drugs, vaccines, you name it, through chips.
[01:08:18.666 --> 01:08:19.626]  Bill Gates is saying it too.
[01:08:20.799 --> 01:08:24.100]  And they're all over the news saying the chemicals in the food and water are sterilizing us.
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:29.401]  But when you talk about it and say you don't want it, the entire establishment attacks you.
[01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:35.803]  But the people being part of this, going along with this, they're destroying themselves.
[01:08:37.543 --> 01:08:38.784]  They've sold out, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:39.184 --> 01:08:43.645]  Here is the head of Pfizer talking about the next level of biomedical tyranny.
[01:08:45.017 --> 01:08:49.719]  It is basically a biological chip that is in the tablet.
[01:08:50.739 --> 01:08:56.001]  And once you take the tablet and it dissolves into your stomach, it sends a signal that you took the tablet.
[01:08:56.881 --> 01:08:58.962]  So imagine the applications of that.
[01:08:59.202 --> 01:08:59.842]  Compliance.
[01:09:00.663 --> 01:09:05.724]  The insurance companies to know that the medicines that patients should take, they do take them.
[01:09:06.405 --> 01:09:10.126]  It is fascinating what happens in this field.
[01:09:10.786 --> 01:09:11.847]  That's fascinating.
[01:09:12.268 --> 01:09:15.391]  Here is the World Health Organization's regional director for Europe.
[01:09:16.792 --> 01:09:29.265]  He's saying he's concerned of the spread of monkeypox in 88 countries that Bill Gates predicted would happen two years ago and has now happened, right when the UN treaty is being ran through to take over all nation-state sovereignty.
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.421]  That people might be congregating.
[01:09:32.441 --> 01:09:33.561]  I've got a whole stack of news.
[01:09:33.921 --> 01:09:35.862]  The New York mayor, the L.A.
[01:09:35.922 --> 01:09:39.103]  mayor, the California governor.
[01:09:39.123 --> 01:09:41.684]  Just dozens of articles right here in my stacks.
[01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:43.225]  You can look at it.
[01:09:43.285 --> 01:09:43.985]  It's all over the news.
[01:09:44.025 --> 01:09:44.866]  You want me to tell you about it?
[01:09:45.646 --> 01:09:51.468]  Saying that we can't have people congregate the monkey pox.
[01:09:52.549 --> 01:09:53.589]  We all got to wear masks.
[01:09:53.609 --> 01:09:55.470]  New York just said mask again.
[01:09:57.371 --> 01:09:59.371]  monkey bucks.
[01:09:59.371 --> 01:10:05.371]  But then meanwhile, the borders wide open.
[01:10:05.131 --> 01:10:07.853]  They're trying to erase Title 42 for any medical testing.
[01:10:07.873 --> 01:10:09.675]  But a few they catch.
[01:10:09.695 --> 01:10:23.665]  And you have the head of the WHO in Europe saying they're really worried about people congregating.
[01:10:24.666 --> 01:10:25.346]  It's you.
[01:10:25.527 --> 01:10:26.627]  You were bad.
[01:10:27.108 --> 01:10:28.229]  Not the open borders.
[01:10:29.511 --> 01:10:35.595]  Not record collapse of Africa and Latin America with all those diseases into the Western world.
[01:10:35.695 --> 01:10:37.896]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:10:39.337 --> 01:10:46.241]  Don't listen to Senator Marco Rubio when he even said, well, citizens coming in that might have a disease can't come in, but non-citizens can.
[01:10:46.301 --> 01:10:53.526]  Just forget that and realize that your suspension of logic is key to being a good slave.
[01:10:54.326 --> 01:10:56.728]  So here is the WHO official.
[01:10:59.974 --> 01:11:38.012]   This has spread to many countries all at the same time and that is the the source of the concern because it just doesn't behave as previous outbreaks which have been sporadic and related to to travel but apart from that first case in the UK there is no connection obvious connection between these cases and and that is that is a concern and why the WHO is is raising this possibility given that it's spread through direct skin-to-skin contact that if you get large groups of Particularly young people together over the summer at festivals and the like, that this might accelerate that spread further.
[01:11:38.032 --> 01:11:40.255]  They call it an amplifying population.
[01:11:40.936 --> 01:11:44.541]  Now that would be a concern and why the WHO has raised it.
[01:11:44.761 --> 01:12:06.381]   Now this is generally a mild disease for most and we need to balance this with you know particularly coming out of the pandemic that we don't cause undue concern but this is once again an animal virus that's spread to the human population And we know that that's not a good thing, and that's why public health teams do want to get on top of this.
[01:12:06.781 --> 01:12:21.015]  Either through public awareness and getting people to think about these symptoms, or through the use of this smallpox vaccine, which is really Elaine gathering dust on the shelves, because smallpox just doesn't circulate around anymore.
[01:12:21.435 --> 01:12:25.900]  But through happy coincidence, it is 85% effective against monkeypox as well.
[01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:29.305]  By happy coincidence, they make it.
[01:12:29.425 --> 01:12:29.965]  It's ready.
[01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:32.267]  It's not gathering dust.
[01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:37.570]  They ordered the making of it a year ago, and Bill Gates said it was coming, and he's a prophet!
[01:12:38.871 --> 01:12:44.675]  Meanwhile, millions a month come across the California-Arizona-Texas border.
[01:12:45.875 --> 01:12:46.656]  No one's checked.
[01:12:47.176 --> 01:12:54.021]  Biden wants to arrest Title 42 for the few that might be checked, but you need to know it's your fault.
[01:12:54.841 --> 01:12:56.602]  And you don't want to go to a nightclub.
[01:12:57.002 --> 01:12:58.062]  You don't want to go to work.
[01:12:58.522 --> 01:12:59.743]  You don't want to have a job.
[01:12:59.803 --> 01:13:01.884]  You need a vaccine pass to live.
[01:13:01.904 --> 01:13:05.265]  We need a UN treaty to protect us.
[01:13:06.625 --> 01:13:13.948]  And I've got clip after clip after clip from New York and from California saying you can't go outside.
[01:13:14.408 --> 01:13:15.629]  You've got to wear a mask.
[01:13:15.749 --> 01:13:16.429]  Monkeypox.
[01:13:17.729 --> 01:13:23.209]   While they're claiming it comes from the third world, it comes from the Rainforest.
[01:13:23.289 --> 01:13:24.510]  It comes from the Congo.
[01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:27.371]  None of that's true, folks.
[01:13:27.391 --> 01:13:28.471]  We've got the articles right here.
[01:13:29.011 --> 01:13:29.751]  They've sequenced it.
[01:13:29.771 --> 01:13:30.592]  It comes out of a lab.
[01:13:30.992 --> 01:13:33.072]  And yeah, it's a little bit stronger than normal monkeypox.
[01:13:33.532 --> 01:13:38.474]  We're so powerful as a species, they have trouble dominating us.
[01:13:39.054 --> 01:13:44.316]  And no matter what they hit us with, like we're cockroaches or something, we just fight back and overcome it.
[01:13:44.336 --> 01:13:48.941]   So they're like, How do we kill people and pose as the saviors?
[01:13:49.301 --> 01:13:54.485]  How do we hit them with chemicals and biologicals and 5G radiologicals?
[01:13:54.886 --> 01:13:58.068]  How do we get them to just go away and die?
[01:13:58.469 --> 01:14:04.734]  Because if we don't, we've done something 10,000 times, a million times bigger than Bernie Madoff.
[01:14:05.295 --> 01:14:06.235]  The numbers are incredible.
[01:14:06.736 --> 01:14:08.738]  Thousands of quadrillions of fake currency.
[01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:12.031]  What are we going to do as they wake up to us?
[01:14:12.171 --> 01:14:14.732]  What are we going to do as they learn what we've done?
[01:14:14.812 --> 01:14:25.656]  Well, just use another panic, another virus, and then they don't even hide the fact they've been wargaming and preparing and the whole scenarios for what's happening right now.
[01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.037]  Are you going to be locked down again?
[01:14:29.057 --> 01:14:31.378]  Are you going to take the monkey pox shot?
[01:14:31.438 --> 01:14:32.639]  Are you going to bow?
[01:14:32.939 --> 01:14:35.960]  How many times will you bow to Bill Gates?
[01:14:37.079 --> 01:14:40.321]  How many times will you get on your knees for Klaus Schwab?
[01:14:40.702 --> 01:14:46.486]  How many times will you bend over to the Carnegie and the CIA?
[01:14:46.886 --> 01:14:57.794]  How many times does the Eastern establishment and these so-called elites that think they're better than all of us and hate us so much they want to kill us so they can inherit the earth they stole?
[01:14:59.635 --> 01:15:00.496]  How many times?
[01:15:02.228 --> 01:15:10.491]  You have to grovel to Bill Gates and Ted Rose and these mass murderers when what they're doing is transparent to any conscious person.
[01:15:10.511 --> 01:15:26.275]  And I'll say this, and this is very profound, if you let them do this to you and your family, when you have all the evidence and all the facts, their argument is you deserve it.
[01:15:27.276 --> 01:15:31.657]  You deserve to die, according to Prince Charles.
[01:15:34.457 --> 01:15:53.671]  You deserve to be murdered because even while they're killing you, even while they're cutting off your resources and announcing that you're non-essential, even while they are involved in their slaughterhouse, you can't admit you're under attack.
[01:15:54.052 --> 01:16:02.298]  And if you have that attitude, and if you have that worldview, it's not my view, it's their view, you deserve to die.
[01:16:03.803 --> 01:16:05.003]  D-I-E.
[01:16:06.504 --> 01:16:07.464]  Die.
[01:16:07.484 --> 01:16:10.565]  And they're saying, we want you to die.
[01:16:11.226 --> 01:16:12.166]  We don't need you.
[01:16:12.226 --> 01:16:13.246]  We have robots.
[01:16:13.306 --> 01:16:14.207]  We have everything.
[01:16:14.667 --> 01:16:16.428]  Humans aren't just cheap slaves now.
[01:16:16.728 --> 01:16:17.548]  They're crap.
[01:16:17.868 --> 01:16:18.728]  They're garbage.
[01:16:19.009 --> 01:16:19.929]  They're obsolete.
[01:16:20.209 --> 01:16:21.269]  They're non-essential.
[01:16:21.609 --> 01:16:22.450]  They're over.
[01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:26.731]  They are phased out.
[01:16:27.612 --> 01:16:31.179]   They are A cancer.
[01:16:31.559 --> 01:16:37.340]  All the news and your children going to public schools with these rich globalists telling you you're crap.
[01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:38.981]  Telling you you're filth.
[01:16:39.341 --> 01:16:40.421]  Telling you you're worthless.
[01:16:40.501 --> 01:17:00.912]   And then you look at these worthless people telling you that and do you submit to Bill Gates and Tedros and William and Peter Daszak and all the rest of them and Fauci or do you say to Tedros and the rest of them That I'm not a slave.
[01:17:01.733 --> 01:17:10.041]  And I have value, and my children have value, and my ancestors that fought and clawed for the success of our species and the launch pad that is planet Earth.
[01:17:10.341 --> 01:17:12.644]  We're not going to let you steal our birthright.
[01:17:12.964 --> 01:17:16.808]  We're going to stand against you, and we're going to defeat you.
[01:17:17.088 --> 01:17:17.848]  That's the choice.
[01:17:18.128 --> 01:17:19.048]  That's the birthright.
[01:17:19.348 --> 01:17:20.389]  That's the crossroads.
[01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:21.989]  That's the fork in the road.
[01:17:22.269 --> 01:17:35.751]  That's everything you and I and all of us are, and everything I've done in 28 years on Earth, and my family before me fighting tyranny for thousands of years, is now coming to this great juncture point right now.
[01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:37.851]  So make your decision.
[01:17:37.851 --> 01:17:44.851]  [Music]
[01:17:44.851 --> 01:17:48.851]  Yippee-yi-yay!
[01:17:48.851 --> 01:17:49.851]  Yippee-yi-yay!
[01:17:50.692 --> 01:17:50.952]  All right.
[01:17:51.193 --> 01:17:53.294]  I'm here every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:17:53.334 --> 01:17:53.735]  Central.
[01:17:54.515 --> 01:17:58.419]  We have Sunday Live with Owen Schroeder and other guest hosts from 6 to 8 p.m.
[01:17:58.439 --> 01:18:03.263]  But I'm going to host a little bit of the next hour to air something particularly informative.
[01:18:04.349 --> 01:18:06.190]  Badass Uncle Sam is in Louisiana.
[01:18:06.831 --> 01:18:10.393]  He's been censored off all media, but he's very popular at Bandai Video.
[01:18:10.914 --> 01:18:14.356]  He's been censored off all corporate media, establishment, globalist media, I should say.
[01:18:14.796 --> 01:18:20.500]  But he's still alive and well and reaching hundreds of thousands of people a week, conservatively, thanks to all of you.
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:27.585]  And he really had an important message this week that he put out, and I want to echo that to all of you right now.
[01:18:27.605 --> 01:18:31.648]  In fact, I had a meme here that's going viral, but I can't find it in the stack.
[01:18:31.668 --> 01:18:32.669]  Maybe tomorrow I'll cover it.
[01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:38.744]  But it deals with the fact that you can't play games with this.
[01:18:40.004 --> 01:18:43.767]  And nobody's coming to save you.
[01:18:44.227 --> 01:18:51.312]  The New World Order is attacking Western world, the idea of prosperity and freedom, because they don't want that idea out there.
[01:18:51.892 --> 01:18:55.474]  That's why we're target number one, because as bad as America is, we got big problems.
[01:18:55.994 --> 01:18:59.657]  Imagine all the other countries still under lockdown and forced inoculations.
[01:19:00.848 --> 01:19:03.390]  We're the best house, as they say, in a bad neighborhood.
[01:19:04.711 --> 01:19:07.833]  And so, we have that information to cover.
[01:19:09.574 --> 01:19:17.020]  And it's incredibly central to everything, collectively as a species, that we are facing.
[01:19:18.681 --> 01:19:21.103]  And so I want to say a few things here in the final segment of this hour.
[01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:27.027]  I'll come back next hour and really play some powerful information and hand the baton to Owen Troyer, 30 minutes into the next hour.
[01:19:27.047 --> 01:19:28.929]  And it's just this.
[01:19:30.712 --> 01:19:32.714]  I never know if this is my last broadcast.
[01:19:34.096 --> 01:19:37.619]  I never know if it's the last time I'm going to be able to talk to you.
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:50.312]  And I am extremely thankful for all of you, whether you are brown or pink or white or male or female, whatever it is, I love you.
[01:19:51.963 --> 01:20:00.946]  And you have a spirit, and you are eternal, and you're real, and God made you, and this planet's amazing, and you're even more amazing, and we've got so much to do together, and I love this crew.
[01:20:02.987 --> 01:20:16.072]  And I look at people collaborating with the satanic system that lie to themselves about what they're involved in, and they pretend they're getting ahead by working with the system, when all they're doing is destroying themselves.
[01:20:18.293 --> 01:20:22.369]   And so, It's like that Elvis song.
[01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:27.653]  Maybe I never told you how much I needed you or loved you.
[01:20:29.234 --> 01:20:32.557]  We'll start the next hour with that, but you were always on my mind.
[01:20:33.397 --> 01:20:48.449]  And I think recognizing each other and recognizing our spirits that transcend what color we are or where we came from, I think that, I don't think I know, that recognition is everything.
[01:20:50.150 --> 01:20:50.931]  That God made us.
[01:20:52.790 --> 01:21:01.873]  But we're part of an amazing plan and that we have a destiny to fulfill together.
[01:21:03.094 --> 01:21:04.074]  And that is so beautiful.
[01:21:06.815 --> 01:21:07.796]  That's really where we are.
[01:21:08.216 --> 01:21:10.397]  You know, I mentioned all this Bill Maher and I didn't get to it yet.
[01:21:10.417 --> 01:21:11.177]  Let's do it right now.
[01:21:11.777 --> 01:21:19.180]  Bill Maher says kids coming out as trans is because it's trendy and being gay is not hip enough.
[01:21:21.172 --> 01:21:31.602]  Disney releases LGBTQ, P is what it is, pedophile, Pride, notice it's even P after it, Pride, themed toys marketed to children.
[01:21:32.182 --> 01:21:33.023]  Oh, children!
[01:21:33.443 --> 01:21:39.029]  It's not about butterflies and birds and unicorns and fun and dinosaurs.
[01:21:39.849 --> 01:21:43.973]  It's about sex and your identity as a child sexually.
[01:21:44.313 --> 01:21:46.816]  That's pedophilia, that's raping consciousness.
[01:21:51.274 --> 01:21:52.555]  And then I've got the other headlines.
[01:21:52.595 --> 01:21:58.557]  California legislature reduces penalties for oral, anal sex with willing children.
[01:21:58.917 --> 01:22:04.139]  As long as it's not vaginal and a baby might not happen, so what of you rape a 10-year-old?
[01:22:04.539 --> 01:22:06.540]  It's their free will, but they don't have free will.
[01:22:06.860 --> 01:22:08.241]  They aren't of the age of consent.
[01:22:08.581 --> 01:22:10.702]  This is where we are.
[01:22:11.022 --> 01:22:15.744]  Not just the chemicals, not just the biologicals, but the cultural death.
[01:22:17.915 --> 01:22:23.597]  So here's Bill Maher saying, well, why are the conservative areas not having half the kids say they're trans?
[01:22:23.957 --> 01:22:24.077]  It's 2%.
[01:22:24.137 --> 01:22:26.738]  Well, the chemicals make them that way.
[01:22:27.338 --> 01:22:28.618]  And why is it liberal areas?
[01:22:28.678 --> 01:22:30.179]  Because they're recruiting.
[01:22:30.859 --> 01:22:34.480]  And Bill Maher's not perfect, but he knows where his audience is.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:37.481]  He knows his audience, even in blue states, doesn't like this.
[01:22:37.981 --> 01:22:44.743]  A sexual relationship of the school and the state with a child about their sexual identity?
[01:22:45.104 --> 01:22:46.284]  I've got four children.
[01:22:48.237 --> 01:23:01.014]  I got a 19-year-old son who's incredible, an 18-year-old daughter who's amazing, a 14-year-old daughter who is over-the-top incredible, and I've got a 5-year-old daughter who is transcendent.
[01:23:03.743 --> 01:23:07.184]  And I've never sat there and told them about sex.
[01:23:07.564 --> 01:23:10.784]  I've never gotten, because that's their own process as adults.
[01:23:11.365 --> 01:23:13.125]  This is a raping of the psyche.
[01:23:13.205 --> 01:23:15.485]  It is a sexual harassment of children.
[01:23:15.786 --> 01:23:19.626]  It is a molestation of their innocence and it is wrong.
[01:23:21.047 --> 01:23:30.789]  And it's happening and it's the sacrament of the satanic system to not just wreck our genes, not just wreck ourselves, but wreck our souls because those are there as well.
[01:23:31.389 --> 01:23:42.334]   And even more important, So even Bill Maher, when it comes down to the line, doesn't want to sign on to sexualizing five-year-olds in California and all over.
[01:23:42.574 --> 01:23:50.181]  I saw dozens of articles this week where they harass elementary students because they, quote, use the wrong pronoun.
[01:23:50.481 --> 01:23:54.365]  Or didn't know the 56 pronouns, it may be 156 next week.
[01:23:54.645 --> 01:24:04.714]  And we sit here and let our children be targeted, and be attacked, and be demonized, and be molested psychologically and spiritually, preparing them for the main attack.
[01:24:06.741 --> 01:24:08.682]  Even Bill Maher has a soul.
[01:24:09.262 --> 01:24:19.925]  Even Bill Maher says leave the children alone and let the Santas pass a law that elementary students shouldn't be told how to give a blowjob or have anal sex.
[01:24:20.505 --> 01:24:23.106]  I don't talk to my children about that!
[01:24:23.606 --> 01:24:25.306]  My son's 19!
[01:24:26.947 --> 01:24:29.127]  He's had his own experiences, his own life!
[01:24:30.708 --> 01:24:37.413]   I don't sit there with my 18 or 19 year old son And say, son, let me tell ya...
[01:24:39.645 --> 01:24:40.866]  And then it just goes on from there.
[01:24:41.726 --> 01:24:48.811]  It's sick, and it's evil, and it's disgusting, because they don't want you following your own instincts and what God made you to do.
[01:24:49.071 --> 01:25:03.561]  They want to kill us, they want to depopulate us, and if you sign on to this, aborting children after they're born with transhumanism and the trans movement to sterilize them, it doesn't mean we hate some dude that thinks he's a woman, and because of chemicals may actually be made more a woman than a man.
[01:25:03.821 --> 01:25:04.581]  I don't hate those people!
[01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:05.362]  I love those people!
[01:25:05.942 --> 01:25:15.045]  But the forcing of it and the deriving of it is evil, and if you submit to it, and if you give in to it, you give up your humanity.
[01:25:15.425 --> 01:25:19.966]  And I will not be part of that, and you should make the decision right now whether you're part of that or not.
[01:25:20.106 --> 01:25:20.626]  Here's Bill Maher.
[01:25:21.467 --> 01:25:30.529]  This issue, yes, part of the rise in LGBT numbers is from people feeling free enough to tell it to a pollster, and that's all to the good.
[01:25:31.069 --> 01:25:33.764]   But some of it is It's trendy.
[01:25:34.644 --> 01:25:35.965]  Penis equals man?
[01:25:36.345 --> 01:25:37.286]  Okay, boomer.
[01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:46.313]  Remember, the prime directive of every teen is anything to shock and challenge the squares who brought you up.
[01:25:46.972 --> 01:25:53.972]  It's why nobody gets a nose ring at 56.
[01:25:53.972 --> 01:26:00.932]   And if you haven't noticed that with kids doing something for the likes
[01:26:00.932 --> 01:26:03.811]   is more important than their own genitals you haven't been paying attention.
[01:26:03.811 --> 01:26:04.311]  attention.
[01:26:04.311 --> 01:26:05.311]  (audience laughing)
[01:26:05.542 --> 01:26:14.667]  Dr. Erica Anderson is a prominent 71-year-old clinical psychologist who is herself transgender and who now says, I think it's gone too far.
[01:26:15.508 --> 01:26:24.233]  The LA Times summarizes, she's come to believe that some children identifying as trans are falling under the influence of their peers and social media.
[01:26:25.512 --> 01:26:36.877]  If you attend a small dinner party of typically very liberal, upper-income Angelenos, it is not uncommon to hear parents who each have a trans kid having a conversation about that.
[01:26:37.277 --> 01:26:40.398]  What are the odds of that happening in Youngstown, Ohio?
[01:26:41.518 --> 01:26:46.060]  If this spike in trans children is all natural, why is it regional?
[01:26:46.961 --> 01:26:53.961]  Either Ohio is shaming them or California is creating them.
[01:26:53.961 --> 01:27:00.961]  [applause]
[01:27:00.961 --> 01:27:01.961]  on InfoWars.com.
[01:27:01.961 --> 01:27:02.841]  But the point is...
[01:27:02.841 --> 01:27:12.840]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:27:04.775 --> 01:27:07.597]  This is really just the establishment knowing they woke folks up.
[01:27:07.977 --> 01:27:10.798]  So they move the Overton window over to sterilize all the children.
[01:27:10.818 --> 01:27:13.320]  It's like, no, no, let's just sterilize some of them.
[01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:14.300]  Let's be reasonable.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:16.261]  And you're already caught in their net.
[01:27:16.522 --> 01:27:22.425]  And I'm not saying Bill Maher is sophisticated enough to do that, because I know people that know him well and are friends with him.
[01:27:22.445 --> 01:27:24.026]  And he really doesn't know all this stuff.
[01:27:24.326 --> 01:27:26.007]  But I think he's starting to get it.
[01:27:26.327 --> 01:27:27.968]  I think Elon Musk is starting to get it.
[01:27:28.648 --> 01:27:32.150]  Or they should get it, because this is spiritual death.
[01:27:32.530 --> 01:27:34.451]  You want to cut your genitals off as an adult?
[01:27:34.751 --> 01:27:35.772]  You want to drink Drano?
[01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:36.933]  You want to blow your head off?
[01:27:37.353 --> 01:27:38.233]  I hope you don't.
[01:27:39.034 --> 01:27:43.376]  But dammit, don't lead children into it, or you are bad.
[01:27:43.416 --> 01:27:46.258]  And there is justice in the universe, and you will pay.
[01:27:46.538 --> 01:27:50.076]   And everybody knows at their Core!
[01:27:51.057 --> 01:27:53.659]  Right down to the bottom, baby, that it's wrong.
[01:27:54.099 --> 01:27:56.541]  Hour number three and four.
[01:27:56.901 --> 01:27:58.302]  Coming up with myself and Owen Schroer.
[01:27:58.622 --> 01:28:00.904]  I'm going to air badass Uncle Sam footage and more.
[01:28:01.184 --> 01:28:03.026]  Your station doesn't carry the next two hours.
[01:28:03.366 --> 01:28:08.950]  Infowars.com forward slash show and band dot video and a big news feed at Infowars.com.
[01:28:09.310 --> 01:28:14.654]  We'll be back with Sunday Live with yours truly, Owen Schroer and badass Uncle Sam.
[01:28:15.365 --> 01:28:21.950]  InfoWars has been selling a variety of Faraday cages to protect your privacy for more than 20 years.
[01:28:22.671 --> 01:28:34.561]  We were one of the first national talk shows to expose satellite tracking and how government corporations and hackers and other criminal groups are using it to steal your identity and sell your information.
[01:28:35.743 --> 01:28:48.951]  Everybody out there watching right now has had the apps and the phone companies and the big tech companies track your data, create a dossier and sell it to hundreds, if not thousands of different organizations.
[01:28:49.391 --> 01:28:55.095]  And they use this data to collectively screw over not just the people of America, but the people of the world.
[01:28:55.575 --> 01:29:04.681]  Now we've sold more than 10 different brands of Faraday cages, but a couple of years ago I said, listen, I want high quality made in America systems.
[01:29:04.934 --> 01:29:08.853]  that the military uses that are also very very affordable.
[01:29:08.853 --> 01:29:15.253]   So we set out to find out who has the main contracts to supply the Pentagon, the FBI, and others.
[01:29:15.253 --> 01:29:18.613]  We finally made contact over a year ago.
[01:29:18.613 --> 01:29:23.253]   We put it in order more than six months ago and they came in, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:29:23.474 --> 01:29:34.004]  We have 12 different sizes of high-quality Faraday cages for iPads, laptops, cell phones, big cell phones, little cell phones.
[01:29:34.205 --> 01:29:47.233]   They've even got huge bags you can put multiple desktops in that are 100% impenetrable so that different organizations and groups and contact tracers cannot penetrate into your device and steal your data and
[01:29:47.233 --> 01:29:50.394]   create a map of your life and how to take you down.
[01:29:50.394 --> 01:29:54.793]   This is so critical that going into the future, everybody is going to be involved in this.
[01:29:54.793 --> 01:29:58.273]   In fact, it's one of the fastest growing industries out there.
[01:29:58.273 --> 01:30:03.493]   We have high quality systems for every different type of device at InfoWarstore.com under our
[01:30:03.493 --> 01:30:08.354]   new private label that we've done with this great company titled Redux.
[01:30:08.354 --> 01:30:13.394]   So get your Redux Faraday cages at InfoWarstore.com and protect your privacy and your life while
[01:30:13.394 --> 01:30:15.153]  you fund the InfoWar Redux.
[01:30:15.153 --> 01:30:20.033]   I want to thank the InfoWars family of viewers and listeners who are amazing activists.
[01:30:20.509 --> 01:30:30.500]  The mere fact that you spread the word about the broadcast, the mere fact that you pray for the show and our crew and our guests, the mere fact that you buy products at InfoWareStore.com is game-changing and is changing the world.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:40.710]  Well now, if you go to InfoWareStore.com, you can get one of the last 15,000 t-shirts of all of our original designs going back more than 25 years.
[01:30:41.598 --> 01:30:46.700]  We're getting rid of all of the inventory and over 150 designs that I've come up with.
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:50.321]  In the future, we'll still have some limited t-shirts that are limited edition.
[01:30:50.601 --> 01:30:55.263]  But right now, if you want to get any of the classic M4 War shirts, most of them have already sold out.
[01:30:55.723 --> 01:30:59.565]  A few months ago, when we launched this initiative, we had 60 plus thousand t-shirts.
[01:30:59.945 --> 01:31:12.408]   Now they're down to 15,000 t-shirts that we're selling at cost to clear out inventory, to fund the operation, and so people can basically wear They're MFORS colors, they're uniform, out in society to
[01:31:12.408 --> 01:31:14.468]  meet like-minded people.
[01:31:14.468 --> 01:31:18.347]   It's an adventure every time you wear an MFORS shirt and go out in public.
[01:31:18.347 --> 01:31:23.748]   So all those classic designs are now limited edition and will never be made again and will
[01:31:23.748 --> 01:31:28.067]   only have limited editions and a limited number of shirts going forward in the future.
[01:31:28.067 --> 01:31:29.868]  You've got to clear the inventory to fund our operation.
[01:31:29.868 --> 01:31:33.907]   I want to thank you all for coming through and I want to encourage viewers and listeners
[01:31:33.907 --> 01:31:39.828]   out there who have not gone out and have not gotten one of these historic shirts to take
[01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:43.108]  action now because these really are part of history.
[01:31:43.490 --> 01:31:46.931]  Now all the shirts are being sold at cost except for one.
[01:31:47.351 --> 01:31:54.254]  That's the Alex Jones was right new limited edition shirt for $24.95 so we get some funds in to run the operation.
[01:31:54.574 --> 01:32:00.576]  And again in the future we'll have limited shirts that we fund our operation with but not this giant catalog of hundreds of shirts.
[01:32:00.616 --> 01:32:06.959]  They're all about to be history and will only exist in your closet or in your drawer and you will have a piece of history.
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:08.703]  So thank you for all your support.
[01:32:08.943 --> 01:32:13.113]  Get your InfoWars limited edition t-shirts while you still can because they're almost all gone.
