[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.750]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:02.751]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[00:00:02.771 --> 00:00:04.032]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[00:00:04.092 --> 00:00:05.433]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[00:00:05.453 --> 00:00:06.233]  And Joe Rogan?
[00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:06.954]  Elon Musk?
[00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:08.175]  You know where they tune in, right?
[00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:11.437]  They tune in right here!
[00:00:13.098 --> 00:00:13.818]  InfoWars.
[00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:15.059]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.760]  Today.
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.383]  Here we are again.
[00:00:20.403 --> 00:00:20.483]  Live.
[00:00:21.123 --> 00:00:24.426]  April 13th, 2022.
[00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:31.525]  on this Wednesday edition.
[00:00:31.525 --> 00:00:36.025]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:44.803]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:52.808]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:55.945 --> 00:01:03.314]  What an epic time to be alive on this beautiful blue jewel hurtling through God's creation.
[00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:08.000]  Again, thank you so much for joining us on this live April 13th.
[00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:10.531]  Wednesday Transmission.
[00:01:10.631 --> 00:01:15.772]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, here captaining the embattled good ship InfoWars.
[00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:20.253]  We'll be here for the next four hours ahead of the War Room with Owen Schroyer at 3 p.m.
[00:01:20.273 --> 00:01:21.073]  Central today.
[00:01:21.093 --> 00:01:23.154]  I have a special guest in studio.
[00:01:23.174 --> 00:01:24.914]  I also intend to open the phones up.
[00:01:25.494 --> 00:01:28.395]  Let me just give you a quick rundown of the incredible stories.
[00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:33.036]  We have the corporate press in overdrive, scrambling hysterically.
[00:01:34.602 --> 00:01:42.284]  Trying to hide the fact that the New York City subway shooter was targeting white people because he believed they needed to die.
[00:01:42.904 --> 00:01:49.386]  And then he also wanted to kill black people that married outside of the African bloodline.
[00:01:51.087 --> 00:01:53.007]  Obviously completely mentally ill.
[00:01:54.228 --> 00:01:55.548]  Out of his mind from his postings.
[00:01:55.608 --> 00:01:57.149]  I've watched several videos this morning.
[00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:59.749]  He was mumbling insane things while he shot people.
[00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:01.090]  That's reported by eyewitnesses.
[00:02:02.253 --> 00:02:05.217]  We don't blame black people for what he did.
[00:02:05.778 --> 00:02:11.365]  We don't blame someone for the color of their skin, for what somebody else with the same skin has done.
[00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:22.425]  But the media does, when it's Dylann Roof, also completely mentally ill, also mumbling incoherently and saying similar things, but from a white perspective.
[00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:38.312]  When he went into an innocent black church and killed nine people at point-blank range and injured others, every white person in America was guilty, and every gun owner was guilty, the corporate media told us, for months, and beat us over the head with it.
[00:02:39.718 --> 00:02:43.541]  We don't blame white people for what that deranged mentally ill person did.
[00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:50.347]  The answer is arming churchgoers, having armed deacons, and that's been stopping these shooters dead in their tracks.
[00:02:51.307 --> 00:03:00.695]  And that's why we have crime rates 4, 5, 10 times higher in places like Chicago, New York, and other areas, D.C., that have taken the guns.
[00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:06.346]  Answer, ladies and gentlemen, is more armed citizens.
[00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:08.166]  And the statistics show that.
[00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:09.507]  But here it is.
[00:03:10.887 --> 00:03:13.488]  What a sterling example of the corporate control.
[00:03:13.548 --> 00:03:18.929]  New York City shooter Frank James is a black nationalist, like the Waukesha parade killer.
[00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.330]  But remember, the media said a truck did that, a car did that.
[00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:22.670]  It was a truck attack.
[00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.631]  Recently released a video manifesto, posted video.
[00:03:28.154 --> 00:03:34.894]   on the new Supreme Court justice saying he hates her because she's married to a white devil.
[00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:38.173]  Absolutely mentally ill, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:38.173 --> 00:03:41.774]  Oh, black Jesus, please kill all the whiteys.
[00:03:41.774 --> 00:03:45.213]  Brooklyn shooting person of interest, Frank James.
[00:03:45.114 --> 00:03:46.095]  They found his credit card.
[00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:47.978]  Witnesses have ID'd him now.
[00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:49.019]  99% chance he's a shooter.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.963]  Oh black Jesus, please kill all the whiteys.
[00:03:52.744 --> 00:03:53.465]  Brooklyn shooting.
[00:03:53.565 --> 00:03:58.451]  Person of the interest, Frank James, made anti-white post on social media.
[00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:01.154]  Here he is dressed up in skull outfits.
[00:04:01.534 --> 00:04:02.975]  He's been in and out of the mental health system.
[00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:04.356]  Was completely schizophrenic.
[00:04:04.817 --> 00:04:07.198]  Just like Dylann Roof's been diagnosed schizophrenic.
[00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.600]  Completely out of his mind.
[00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:11.082]  Not the gun's fault.
[00:04:11.562 --> 00:04:12.883]  Not his black skin's fault.
[00:04:13.263 --> 00:04:15.025]  Not Dylann Roof's white skin's fault.
[00:04:15.465 --> 00:04:16.426]  Not the gun's fault.
[00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.468]  The mental illness's fault.
[00:04:19.068 --> 00:04:23.212]  The Demonic Possessions Fault, whatever you want to call it, but here it is.
[00:04:23.372 --> 00:04:29.117]  Inside Frank James Chilling, bullets and body bags post before a subway shooting.
[00:04:29.497 --> 00:04:32.020]  This person of interest says, we're in World War III.
[00:04:36.664 --> 00:04:39.365]  I came face-to-face with the mumbling Brooklyn subway shooter.
[00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:41.266]  New York Post has a witness talking about it.
[00:04:41.607 --> 00:04:43.728]  Didn't even know really where he was or what he was doing.
[00:04:44.468 --> 00:04:46.149]  Full-on lunatic land.
[00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:47.950]  Just like Dylann Roof.
[00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.971]  Didn't know who he was and was gibbering to police.
[00:04:51.272 --> 00:04:52.972]  But that was in the back of the paper with him.
[00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:56.554]  No, it was all premeditated and it was all white people's fault.
[00:04:56.974 --> 00:04:59.036]  That's the reason this happened.
[00:04:59.396 --> 00:04:59.656]  No!
[00:05:00.276 --> 00:05:03.038]  It is not my fault when somebody that looks like me does something wrong.
[00:05:03.498 --> 00:05:05.539]  It's my fault when I do something wrong!
[00:05:06.854 --> 00:05:09.435]  But see, authoritarians always blame whole groups.
[00:05:09.935 --> 00:05:10.775]  That's what the left does.
[00:05:10.795 --> 00:05:11.795]  They're sick in their evil.
[00:05:12.416 --> 00:05:13.816]  It's Wednesday, April 13th, 2022.
[00:05:13.956 --> 00:05:16.377]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:16.417 --> 00:05:18.217]  I intend to open the phones up in the second hour.
[00:05:18.237 --> 00:05:23.118]  And then Ali Alexander joins us with breaking intel in studio in the third hour.
[00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.639]  You'll definitely want to stay with us for that.
[00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:31.021]  And of course, another great guest host coming up in the fourth hour ahead of Owen Schroer and the War Room, 3 p.m.
[00:05:31.041 --> 00:05:35.262]  Central today, here on the Embattled InfoWars Network.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.222]  Okay, let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:05:38.262 --> 00:05:44.287]  We've got some really good news, some bad news, and some ugly news, but it's all incredibly important to know news.
[00:05:44.327 --> 00:05:48.631]  First off, it's such a bellwether and an illustration of how the system has collapsed and discredited.
[00:05:49.692 --> 00:06:03.012]   CNN owned by AT&T and Time Warner spent $300 million just in the launch of CNN+.
[00:06:03.012 --> 00:06:06.852]   They spent another $100 million in infrastructure at CNN building the studios.
[00:06:07.361 --> 00:06:17.307]  That's $400 million and a year's planning and it has, wait for it, it's launched the last two weeks.
[00:06:17.407 --> 00:06:19.769]  First week had about 7,000 viewers.
[00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:21.630]  The next week had about 10,000 viewers.
[00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:23.151]  I'm going to explain that again.
[00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:24.252]  I have all the ratings right here.
[00:06:25.693 --> 00:06:27.034]  Less than 10,000 people tuned in.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:42.027]  To a $400 million enterprise, ladies and gentlemen, a B-rated AM radio station in a mid-sized city has 10,000 listeners an hour.
[00:06:44.228 --> 00:06:54.674]  We on Terrestrial Radio, according to the ratings by the ad agencies that get aggregates of the Arbitron, get over 3 million a day, very conservatively, on talk radio.
[00:06:56.735 --> 00:06:59.057]  The bigger shows like Limbaugh, 20 million when he was around.
[00:06:59.477 --> 00:07:01.298]  Coast to Coast AM, 15, 16 million.
[00:07:01.318 --> 00:07:02.019]  George Norrie's huge.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.620]  But oh, nobody cares!
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:05.561]  That's just talk radio.
[00:07:05.581 --> 00:07:08.163]  Who cares about Limbaugh or George Norrie or Glenn Beck?
[00:07:09.124 --> 00:07:10.044]  Or, you know, Alex Jones.
[00:07:10.244 --> 00:07:15.528]  Because most of the stations don't subscribe to the ratings, so they're not added to the ratings, basically.
[00:07:16.048 --> 00:07:19.791]  But our rated stations, three plus million a day.
[00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:23.572]   And then on the internet, conservatively, Three million again.
[00:07:24.513 --> 00:07:26.494]  At our height, it was 10 million, 20 million a day.
[00:07:26.774 --> 00:07:29.716]  As big as Limbaugh, but they censored us and crushed us down.
[00:07:30.257 --> 00:07:33.459]  Folks have to know how to find us at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:38.642]  But my point is, we operate on $25 million a year.
[00:07:39.903 --> 00:07:47.067]  We have to sell $60 million worth of product on average to be able to then get money to fund ourselves.
[00:07:48.108 --> 00:07:51.490]  To break even, we've got to sell $60 million worth of product.
[00:07:53.908 --> 00:07:54.748]  And some years we haven't.
[00:07:56.009 --> 00:08:05.973]  But I did things like take some of the money we raised in the years and invest it in real estate to be able to then sell that real estate when I knew I'd need it down the road to dump it back in the operation.
[00:08:06.213 --> 00:08:07.113]  And I've already done that.
[00:08:07.634 --> 00:08:09.234]  So I'm down to my last chips here.
[00:08:10.335 --> 00:08:11.855]  But not because we're not popular.
[00:08:12.256 --> 00:08:12.876]  Imagine this.
[00:08:13.316 --> 00:08:15.597]  We're operating on $27 million a year.
[00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:22.640]  We're operating on $27 million a year with our own servers, own satellites, own crew, own legal, with all the attacks.
[00:08:25.758 --> 00:08:36.206]  Our own infrastructure and CNN Plus launched with $400 million and has less than 10,000 viewers a week.
[00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:44.833]  You can start a cooking show yourself on YouTube and if it's half decent, within a week you'll have 10,000 views guaranteed.
[00:08:45.994 --> 00:08:53.079]  I mean a dead cat could get more viewers with a webcam on it in the middle of the street than CNN can.
[00:08:54.651 --> 00:08:57.873]  Everyone can't stand CNN.
[00:08:58.374 --> 00:09:00.395]  What did old Joe Rogan say about it?
[00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.638]  Joe had a great way of saying it this morning.
[00:09:05.658 --> 00:09:09.901]  I don't usually get into his text on air, but this one really says it well.
[00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:16.445]  They were foolish thinking they would get people to pay money for something they don't like for free.
[00:09:18.447 --> 00:09:20.128]  And he says they spent $300 million on it.
[00:09:20.148 --> 00:09:21.269]  I went and looked it up, it was actually $400 million.
[00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.211]  And that's absolutely true, isn't it?
[00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:27.872]  So I'm going to be getting into that.
[00:09:30.393 --> 00:09:31.974]  And what does that illustrate?
[00:09:33.234 --> 00:09:36.296]  Their top shows have 800,000 viewers in primetime.
[00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.117]  Their average show, about 100,000 viewers.
[00:09:40.098 --> 00:09:48.282]  With billions a year funding them, we have, on average, I have them to the numbers, 4.7 million views a day on Bandot Video.
[00:09:49.363 --> 00:09:51.364]  You're like, wait a minute, you just said you have 3 million views a day.
[00:09:52.586 --> 00:09:53.746]  Our streams are separate.
[00:09:53.906 --> 00:09:55.867]  Then we have some videos on Bandot Video.
[00:09:56.447 --> 00:09:57.908]  I don't count the other views.
[00:09:57.928 --> 00:09:59.488]  I'm talking about other people's views.
[00:10:00.409 --> 00:10:05.190]  And all the views on Bandot Video is 4.7 million the last month on average a day.
[00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:07.671]  Some days as much as 9 million.
[00:10:08.071 --> 00:10:08.851]  So it averages out.
[00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:13.153]  So we've got 4 plus million viewers a day on Bandot Video.
[00:10:13.573 --> 00:10:15.513]  Millions tuning into our streams every day.
[00:10:15.853 --> 00:10:17.214]  Millions on talk radio.
[00:10:18.114 --> 00:10:20.695]  And we're operating on 27 million dollars.
[00:10:21.938 --> 00:10:30.338]  They can't get 10,000 views a week on $400 million.
[00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:40.538]   Now you know why they're having summits talking about how they want to silence me and Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson.
[00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.811]  Now you know why they're censoring because no one likes them.
[00:10:44.032 --> 00:10:45.152]  They've been rejected.
[00:10:45.512 --> 00:10:46.273]  They're a fraud.
[00:10:47.665 --> 00:10:53.911]  A federal jury just found not guilty all the patsies in Michigan in the Whitmer kidnapping plot.
[00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:55.372]  The FBI ran it.
[00:10:56.433 --> 00:11:01.118]  Juries are now acquitting and releasing Jan 6th defendants that are finally getting to court.
[00:11:01.458 --> 00:11:02.599]  Judges are releasing them.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.343]  Black Lives Matter goes and attacks CNN.
[00:11:06.623 --> 00:11:09.165]  They know who the enemy is, even though they're run by the globalists.
[00:11:09.425 --> 00:11:11.728]  Their own people aren't buying the Kool-Aid.
[00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:14.775]  That's one of the big stories.
[00:11:14.815 --> 00:11:17.476]  We have the mass shooting, the media trying to cover it up.
[00:11:17.576 --> 00:11:18.636]  We're going to get to all of it.
[00:11:19.076 --> 00:11:26.478]  We've got huge economic developments, massive Biden developments, over-the-top information on the war and what's developing there.
[00:11:27.059 --> 00:11:29.179]  Huge pedophile and grooming news.
[00:11:29.639 --> 00:11:30.740]  The biggest shit ever.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.240]  Massive censorship news.
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:33.860]  Elon Musk battling back.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.501]  I bet the inside baseball on that.
[00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:39.342]  A while back, but I've been asked not to say anything about it.
[00:11:41.647 --> 00:11:42.788]  That's why I told you about a year ago.
[00:11:42.848 --> 00:11:44.990]  I said, Musk claims he's going to take on the New World Order.
[00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:45.751]  I don't know if that's true.
[00:11:46.352 --> 00:11:49.095]  I've been on the fence about the guy, but now he's starting to prove himself.
[00:11:51.217 --> 00:11:52.278]  And he lives right here in Austin.
[00:11:52.298 --> 00:11:52.998]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:11:53.979 --> 00:11:56.482]  And I run with people that run with him on a weekly basis.
[00:11:57.343 --> 00:11:58.744]  And that's just what I've been told.
[00:11:59.765 --> 00:12:00.006]  So...
[00:12:01.701 --> 00:12:03.882]  You're actually seeing what I was told was going to happen.
[00:12:04.403 --> 00:12:06.244]  So this is one hell of a time to be alive, folks.
[00:12:06.944 --> 00:12:08.466]  And it's not like Musk or anybody's perfect.
[00:12:08.526 --> 00:12:10.207]  He just sees the old establishments dying.
[00:12:10.587 --> 00:12:11.648]  Why would you stay on that ship?
[00:12:12.989 --> 00:12:14.109]  And that leads us to this point.
[00:12:14.349 --> 00:12:17.131]  Infowars is doing the most important work it's ever done.
[00:12:17.592 --> 00:12:20.774]  And I'm always up here having to scrabble to get money just to stay on the air.
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:30.205]  When we're having our most important work ever and become more authoritative and more influential in intellectual circles around the world.
[00:12:30.305 --> 00:12:35.128]  So your investment in InfoWars is always paying off in Freedom and Liberty and Awakening.
[00:12:35.428 --> 00:12:37.410]  And it's paying off better day by day.
[00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.851]  It's like a pregnancy that's eight and a half months in.
[00:12:39.891 --> 00:12:40.972]  You're about to get the baby.
[00:12:41.372 --> 00:12:42.313]  It's about to be healthy.
[00:12:42.713 --> 00:12:44.234]  All the work's coming in now.
[00:12:44.514 --> 00:12:45.375]  We're in the birth pains.
[00:12:46.226 --> 00:12:52.211]  But I can tell you, I have almost spent half the reserve money I have that was just like $4 million.
[00:12:52.931 --> 00:12:54.773]  For a company this important, that was nothing.
[00:12:55.193 --> 00:13:01.298]  I had $4 million five months ago, and I got $2.3 million right now.
[00:13:01.338 --> 00:13:03.119]  So I guess half, almost.
[00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:12.767]  And those are my androges, and we need everybody we've got working here, and I'm not bitching or complaining, but why should we have layoffs when everything we said is coming true and we're winning?
[00:13:13.547 --> 00:13:16.529]  I've got all the Democrat lawsuits coming to a head with trials this summer.
[00:13:16.769 --> 00:13:17.670]  I've got to pay for all that.
[00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:24.254]  I've got judges doing all these fake sanctions on me massively that top law firms say they've never seen and that break the law.
[00:13:24.494 --> 00:13:25.895]  But if I don't pay them, they'll have me arrested.
[00:13:26.415 --> 00:13:32.759]  I mean, we're under massive attack because we've entered the thick of the battle, the key gladiatorial event that's going to decide so much.
[00:13:32.819 --> 00:13:38.502]  So now, your whole investment could really be damaged in liberty if you let them take down this standard of freedom.
[00:13:38.863 --> 00:13:42.205]  I need everybody, seriously, to get off the fence and go.
[00:13:43.598 --> 00:13:44.979]  To InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:13:45.019 --> 00:13:45.680]  You hear the ads?

[00:14:29.796 --> 00:14:33.316]   And I'm just asking everybody to go to infowarstore.com right now,
[00:14:33.316 --> 00:14:37.796]   especially those that have never gotten a product, and get a piece of history, and fund the InfoWar,
[00:14:37.796 --> 00:14:39.515]  and help us all win this fight.
[00:14:39.515 --> 00:14:41.836]  Don't let them take down the standard of freedom.
[00:14:41.836 --> 00:14:45.155]   Don't let the globalists take down their number one enemy of populist resistance.
[00:14:45.155 --> 00:14:50.275]   Please, go now to infowarstore.com and be part of the second American revolution worldwide.
[00:14:50.275 --> 00:14:52.075]  Well, we took on the new world order.
[00:14:52.075 --> 00:14:53.355]  We took on the globalists.
[00:14:53.355 --> 00:14:58.596]   We exposed how they operate using pedophile rings, and narcotics trafficking, and so much more.
[00:14:58.596 --> 00:15:08.596]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.082]  And really nobody was talking about this stuff when we were breaking it down 25 years ago.
[00:15:05.303 --> 00:15:07.104]  But I didn't discover this myself.
[00:15:07.344 --> 00:15:12.027]  It was the original Patriots that were aware of how the whole system really operated.
[00:15:12.987 --> 00:15:15.049]  And I could list off all their names, but I've already done that.
[00:15:15.089 --> 00:15:20.612]  But I got a chance to interview those men many, many, many, many, many times on this very broadcast.
[00:15:21.772 --> 00:15:22.653]  And it was mainly men.
[00:15:24.114 --> 00:15:25.594]  And they were prestigious as well.
[00:15:26.155 --> 00:15:46.005]   Congressman, former Directors, deputy directors of the FBI, former top generals, head of the Air Force Weapons Development, head of the HAARP program, and they knew what was going on and I thought it was fantastical but I knew part of it was true because I'd done my own research and knew that most of what they were saying was true.
[00:15:46.365 --> 00:15:49.206]  I couldn't disprove the other things and later I found out it was all real.
[00:15:50.826 --> 00:15:55.328]  Just some people tuning in here think it sounds crazy and then so much of it ends up being true.
[00:15:56.128 --> 00:15:57.909]  Boy do I wish I was wrong about most of this.
[00:15:58.735 --> 00:15:59.456]  I wish I was wrong.
[00:16:00.977 --> 00:16:03.479]  But 98% of the time, we're not wrong.
[00:16:05.241 --> 00:16:09.225]  And the question is, can people face the horror of what we're dealing with and stop this?
[00:16:11.247 --> 00:16:12.948]  All right, I want to get into the censorship.
[00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:20.170]  In the last segment of this hour, I already mentioned it, but it's really a big deal, and it ties in to the zombie nature of CNN.
[00:16:20.231 --> 00:16:23.373]  I mean, CNN's had no viewers for really five, six years.
[00:16:24.293 --> 00:16:25.674]  But billions are pumped in a year.
[00:16:25.754 --> 00:16:26.355]  Why is that?
[00:16:26.515 --> 00:16:29.177]  Well, it speaks to a lot, and it's really a bellwether.
[00:16:30.649 --> 00:16:34.931]  Or a sign of where the establishment in Hollywood and the whole combine is.
[00:16:35.031 --> 00:16:35.952]  They know they're dead.
[00:16:36.392 --> 00:16:37.453]  They know no one's listening.
[00:16:37.853 --> 00:16:38.973]  They know they've already lost.
[00:16:39.434 --> 00:16:53.741]  That's why they're trying to overturn the chessboard and fully gaslight the American people in some hope that if society implodes enough, that people will forget all the crimes and lies and brainwashing that they have been engaged in.
[00:16:55.002 --> 00:16:58.003]  But let's get to this big piece of news right now.
[00:16:58.783 --> 00:16:59.444]  Dylan Roof!
[00:17:01.345 --> 00:17:15.211]  Charleston, 2015 in June, he goes into an innocent black church of people he never met, didn't know, who'd done nothing to him, and he shot more than 15 people, killing 9.
[00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:20.873]  And they reported, well the police said that he was gibbering incoherently and appeared to be schizophrenic.
[00:17:22.434 --> 00:17:26.856]  That matter, they said all white people were to blame, and that all gun owners were to blame.
[00:17:28.856 --> 00:17:29.797]  No, I'm not to blame.
[00:17:31.024 --> 00:17:32.265]  And white people are not to blame.
[00:17:32.725 --> 00:17:34.427]  This lunatic is to blame.
[00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:56.023]  Just like the New York subway shooter Frank James, who shot more than 16 people, many in critical condition, is a black nationalist, like Waukesha parade killer, recently released video manifesto, posted video of the new Supreme Court Justice saying he doesn't like her because she's married to a white person.
[00:17:58.104 --> 00:18:02.471]   Another Jibbering, crazy, lunatic.
[00:18:02.591 --> 00:18:03.632]  Do we blame black people?
[00:18:03.852 --> 00:18:05.694]  No, we don't blame black people.
[00:18:06.535 --> 00:18:07.516]  But who do we blame?
[00:18:07.556 --> 00:18:08.838]  We blame the corporate media.
[00:18:10.202 --> 00:18:12.483]  And we blame the establishment stirring up all this hate.
[00:18:12.983 --> 00:18:18.366]  And we blame them covering up the fact that black-on-white crime is at least 10 times white-on-black crime.
[00:18:18.646 --> 00:18:22.328]  Because the media promotes that white people are bad and deserve to be mugged and attacked.
[00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:27.811]  And many black leaders, even where I live in Texas, say, don't rob in your neighborhood, go rob white people.
[00:18:28.491 --> 00:18:30.432]  How about you don't rob or kill anybody?
[00:18:30.672 --> 00:18:31.212]  How about that?
[00:18:33.793 --> 00:18:35.534]  Unbelievable.
[00:18:38.596 --> 00:18:38.776]  So.
[00:18:41.189 --> 00:18:45.275]  I don't have to remind you what happened on the subway yesterday or the tear gas he used and all the craziness.
[00:18:45.836 --> 00:18:50.382]  But the point is, this guy was out of his mind.
[00:18:50.702 --> 00:18:57.532]  And the media is still not pointing out that he was a black supremacist, even though we have the videos linked in articles on Infowars.com.
[00:18:58.769 --> 00:19:01.031]  Where his YouTube is still active.
[00:19:01.311 --> 00:19:02.953]  By the way, I'm saying don't censor him.
[00:19:03.273 --> 00:19:06.035]  We need to hear what people like Adolf Hitler said.
[00:19:06.836 --> 00:19:08.417]  Or Joseph Stalin said.
[00:19:08.737 --> 00:19:09.898]  Or Mao Tse-Tung said.
[00:19:09.979 --> 00:19:11.059]  Or Kim Jong-Un said.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:18.125]  Or this individual, black nationalist, Frank James.
[00:19:20.187 --> 00:19:23.170]  Because once we hear what they have to say, we can respond and know what's going on.
[00:19:24.502 --> 00:19:25.463]  Kill All Whitey!
[00:19:25.563 --> 00:19:32.231]  Suspect in Brooklyn subway shooting, spouted hateful black nationalist rhetoric, praised beautiful 9-11.
[00:19:34.693 --> 00:19:41.401]  Turns out he was on the FBI terror list, and that agents had tried to investigate him, but the investigation was killed.
[00:19:43.132 --> 00:19:50.398]  Outrage, eruption, or FBI didn't stop Kill Whitey shooting suspect because they don't have mental institutions anymore.
[00:19:51.019 --> 00:19:53.741]  They just let these folks run around on the street.
[00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:57.524]  Whether it's Dylan Roof, or whether it's this lunatic.
[00:20:00.026 --> 00:20:05.210]  But ask yourselves, why are you not hearing about him being a black nationalist or wanting to kill whites?
[00:20:05.931 --> 00:20:08.113]  Why do you got to go to Infowars.com to find that?
[00:20:08.393 --> 00:20:09.254]  Or Gateway Pundit?
[00:20:09.334 --> 00:20:09.894]  Or Breitbart?
[00:20:10.655 --> 00:20:11.916]  Or I'm sure Tucker Carlson tonight.
[00:20:13.834 --> 00:20:15.563]  Because the corporate media follows its orders.
[00:20:16.025 --> 00:20:17.734]  They say men are women and women are men.
[00:20:19.684 --> 00:20:25.770]  When a black crazy person goes out and kills white people, well, let's just forget the story and move on.
[00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:36.561]  But when a white lunatic goes out and kills some black folks, let's put salt in the wound and rub it in and make it a huge deal to create more division, where the Democrats then pose as the saviors of the Democratic Party.
[00:20:36.601 --> 00:20:37.722]  But here's the really big news.
[00:20:37.742 --> 00:20:43.668]  I'm going to get to a special report that just premiered the last hour at Infowars.com by Greg Reese that ties into this.
[00:20:45.154 --> 00:20:56.220]  Remember, two days into Biden's stolen administration in January of 2021, they get up there in press conferences and they say, white people and white supremacists are the number one threat, and what is a white supremacist?
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:00.863]  Someone that questions lockdowns, forced inoculations, open borders, or election fraud.
[00:21:01.203 --> 00:21:04.765]  And they put out the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism that I've harped on.
[00:21:06.066 --> 00:21:13.230]  Then a month ago, the FBI puts out an official battle plan saying they're spending the majority of their money per capita on anti-terrorism on white people.
[00:21:14.787 --> 00:21:16.009]  And they put out all these alerts.
[00:21:16.449 --> 00:21:17.371]  What's a terrorist?
[00:21:18.532 --> 00:21:20.995]  Position in opposition to COVID measures.
[00:21:21.576 --> 00:21:22.878]  Claims of election fraud.
[00:21:22.998 --> 00:21:23.759]  See how that works?
[00:21:24.881 --> 00:21:27.765]  That was put on NBC News, Fox News, everywhere.
[00:21:28.085 --> 00:21:29.367]  But see, the wheels are coming off.
[00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:31.310]  The Whitmer fraud.
[00:21:33.024 --> 00:21:51.055]  Millions and millions spent going out and canvassing Michigan to find mainly young white men who came from fatherless homes, who were looking for male role models, and who were upset about the decline of America and wanted to train with firearms to be basically in the military without joining.
[00:21:51.775 --> 00:22:03.779]   And they typecast, they spent years setting them up, they activated them and ordered them, the FBI recorded this themselves, it got into evidence, Ordered them to attack Whitmer's house.
[00:22:03.979 --> 00:22:05.040]  Ordered them to kidnap her.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.561]  Ordered them to cut her head off.
[00:22:07.361 --> 00:22:08.041]  And they're on tape.
[00:22:08.121 --> 00:22:09.542]  No, no, I don't want to!
[00:22:09.922 --> 00:22:16.886]  But the FBI agents and informants muscle them and command them and order them to at least show up and run around at night in the bushes by her house.
[00:22:18.127 --> 00:22:22.729]  So they could then say she was a victim when people wanted to impeach her during the lockdowns.
[00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.412]  And the same FBI team that did that then ran January 6th.
[00:22:27.472 --> 00:22:30.894]  That's why the FBI comes to talk to you about January 6th.
[00:22:35.484 --> 00:22:37.265]  As is being set up right now for me to do.
[00:22:37.925 --> 00:22:38.865]  I'm doing a proffer.
[00:22:38.905 --> 00:22:39.666]  I'm going to talk to him.
[00:22:39.686 --> 00:22:40.286]  I've done nothing wrong.
[00:22:41.046 --> 00:22:42.887]  The whole big team wants to come out here and talk to me.
[00:22:42.907 --> 00:22:43.307]  I'm like, okay.
[00:22:43.367 --> 00:22:48.589]  And I'm going to sit there and ask him, hey, how about I interview you and ask you guys a little bit of questions here?
[00:22:49.009 --> 00:22:52.010]  I mean, you want to know who the main suspects are who ran this thing?
[00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.590]  I mean, it's your bosses.
[00:22:54.071 --> 00:22:55.491]  It's your ass sitting in that seat.
[00:22:57.412 --> 00:23:00.493]  I mean, it's upside down world here, Jack.
[00:23:01.744 --> 00:23:05.666]  Alex Jones doesn't go around storming facilities and beating up cops.
[00:23:06.087 --> 00:23:08.808]  Alex Jones doesn't run around outside the governor's houses at night.
[00:23:09.569 --> 00:23:11.970]  Alex Jones doesn't want a fricking civil war and violence.
[00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.171]  I want stability and a future for my children!
[00:23:16.633 --> 00:23:18.734]  And you think you're going to free me for what you're doing?
[00:23:20.915 --> 00:23:24.998]  No, it's you, the New World Order, that are going to be brought to justice, in the name of Jesus.
[00:23:26.118 --> 00:23:30.181]  The power structure of the world is inbred, decadent, and incompetent.
[00:23:31.357 --> 00:23:32.398]  And they're losing control.
[00:23:32.418 --> 00:23:37.322]  And that's a very dangerous point to be at because they're cornered.
[00:23:38.623 --> 00:23:40.044]  We want to pray for stability.
[00:23:40.084 --> 00:23:41.025]  We want to pray for peace.
[00:23:41.045 --> 00:23:44.488]  We want to be Christ-like at this point, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:44.508 --> 00:23:52.095]  And we want to reach out to everyone we know and warn them that following anything MSM says is a death sentence.
[00:23:53.476 --> 00:23:54.856]  This is pure poison.
[00:23:55.036 --> 00:24:07.801]  Everything Hollywood does, everything the Democrats do, everything Bill Gates does, everything the CFR pushes, is antithetical to an open, free, successful, secure society on its face.
[00:24:09.141 --> 00:24:11.282]  And we're winning culture wars all over the world.
[00:24:12.162 --> 00:24:21.865]  That's why the globalists want physical civil war and rioting and death, because it's the only way they think they can smokescreen what they've done and not all go to prison.
[00:24:24.602 --> 00:24:26.585]  So they want violence going into this midterm.
[00:24:27.346 --> 00:24:30.291]  Here's the headline, Democrat Death March to November Town Hall.
[00:24:30.572 --> 00:24:33.436]  And it just says every poll shows the biggest landslide in U.S.
[00:24:33.476 --> 00:24:33.757]  history.
[00:24:34.017 --> 00:24:35.620]  Well, Trump won the huge landslide.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.362]  And he won the second time in a landslide.
[00:24:37.382 --> 00:24:37.923]  They stole it!
[00:24:38.939 --> 00:24:43.463]  And they're planting false flags to blame the American people and stir up a race war.
[00:24:44.023 --> 00:24:51.909]  As I've pointed out, you will see mass shootings in subways, and in churches, and in colleges, and in public schools, and at shopping malls.
[00:24:51.949 --> 00:24:54.752]  I've been saying it every day for the last few months.
[00:24:56.813 --> 00:25:02.698]  All they gotta do is know about schizophrenics that are out there, and give them weapons and encourage them, and then turn the cameras off.
[00:25:04.767 --> 00:25:06.488]  As they did in New York, yet again.
[00:25:06.508 --> 00:25:13.733]  And I'm not saying it's staged, but we know the FBI was told, knew about him, and the higher-ups didn't let them stop him.
[00:25:15.354 --> 00:25:16.675]  I'm not blaming everybody at the FBI.
[00:25:16.695 --> 00:25:21.779]  Because there are good people in all these agencies and groups, folks, but it's at the top.
[00:25:21.899 --> 00:25:24.180]  We've got a serious, serious problem.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.762]  But the real enemy is not the Justice Department, it's us.
[00:25:26.902 --> 00:25:28.003]  We've allowed this to happen.
[00:25:29.212 --> 00:25:33.555]  Our complacency, our laziness, our compliance with corruption has gotten us here.
[00:25:33.615 --> 00:25:35.436]  So let's continue here.
[00:25:37.678 --> 00:25:39.139]  Live feeds the name of the show today.
[00:25:39.619 --> 00:25:45.002]  MSM scrambling to hide fact that a black supremacist carried out subway terror attack.
[00:25:46.583 --> 00:25:49.665]  We're about to air a very powerful report that just went live.
[00:25:51.106 --> 00:25:54.729]  And it's a brief history of criminal FBI entrapment operations.
[00:25:57.745 --> 00:26:02.628]  But I wanted to show you a few more of these articles here.
[00:26:02.648 --> 00:26:07.470]  If you've been hiding under a rock, I know most of you haven't, this ruling happened Friday.
[00:26:08.031 --> 00:26:09.171]  The Whitmer Fraud.
[00:26:09.491 --> 00:26:10.652]  You should go read it at town hall.
[00:26:12.013 --> 00:26:15.194]  Judge won't force double agent to testify in kidnap plot.
[00:26:15.735 --> 00:26:16.395]  It's all coming out.
[00:26:16.895 --> 00:26:25.140]  FBI domestic terrorism cases have more than doubled since they widely expanded the definition of domestic terror threats to any white person committing a crime.
[00:26:27.745 --> 00:26:34.629]  Defendant Daniel Harris, acquitted in Whitmer trial, took the stand and said he thought he was going for beers the night he was arrested.
[00:26:36.871 --> 00:26:43.535]  And they have the tapes that the FBI themselves made where they're ordering them to attack and ordering them to be part of this.
[00:26:44.175 --> 00:26:46.837]  Two acquitted in Whitmer case, others in mistrial.
[00:26:47.677 --> 00:26:49.378]  Because it was staged.
[00:26:51.719 --> 00:26:59.096]   And here's the fact sheet, National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, that came out That deals with all of this.
[00:27:00.698 --> 00:27:03.640]  Here's Biden declares white supremacy greatest threat to America.
[00:27:04.021 --> 00:27:07.904]  So never forget January 9th, Capitol insurrection was January 6th.
[00:27:11.268 --> 00:27:22.078]  He also came out today and said, we have to ban guns and prostitutes and make prostitutes liable with guns.
[00:27:24.815 --> 00:27:26.955]  In an anti-gun manufacturer speech.
[00:27:26.995 --> 00:27:34.197]  I mean, he's gone from embarrassing and a gibbering idiot to a whacked out clown.
[00:27:36.557 --> 00:27:37.357]  Here's the big story.
[00:27:37.457 --> 00:27:40.978]  A federal jury delivers a rebuke of FBI entrapment.
[00:27:42.438 --> 00:27:43.539]  It's beyond entrapment.
[00:27:43.579 --> 00:27:45.639]  They led the organization.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.180]  So let's go ahead and talk about this right now.
[00:27:54.414 --> 00:28:11.227]  When you look at what happened in Whitmer and the attempted kidnapping that was provocateur and false flag with the Justice Department, that same unit that ran that was then rewarded by being brought to January 6th, and we know was in charge of the FBI counterterrorism force of up to a thousand agents that were there at the Capitol that day.
[00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:16.871]  So there, I'm one person that gets there in the middle of it, tries to stop it, and got thousands to go away from going into the Capitol.
[00:28:18.412 --> 00:28:27.411]   And imagine if the thousand FBI agents and hostage rescue team people had gotten the order, To go stop the crowd and say, hey, don't do that, come back.
[00:28:27.891 --> 00:28:28.732]  It would have stopped.
[00:28:29.393 --> 00:28:34.178]  Instead of having a few hundred cops try to stop the 500 or 600 that actually attacked and went in.
[00:28:34.538 --> 00:28:38.202]  But somebody wanted this to take place to demonize the American people.
[00:28:38.202 --> 00:28:40.202]  Here's Greg Reese's report.
[00:28:40.202 --> 00:28:46.702]  [MUSIC]
[00:28:46.702 --> 00:28:51.603]   Last week, a jury acquitted two men of all charges in a plot to kidnap
[00:28:51.603 --> 00:28:54.302]  Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.
[00:28:54.302 --> 00:28:57.702]  Because it was clear that the FBI set the whole thing up.
[00:28:58.489 --> 00:29:05.511]  While it is surprisingly good news to hear of their acquittal, it is not strange to hear of the FBI setting people up.
[00:29:06.191 --> 00:29:07.912]  They've been doing it for generations.
[00:29:09.776 --> 00:29:16.261]  During the late 60s, FBI informant Tommy the Traveler traveled to colleges throughout the U.S.
[00:29:16.581 --> 00:29:18.402]  posing as a student protester.
[00:29:19.163 --> 00:29:32.612]  He encouraged non-violent activists to make Molotov cocktail explosives out of gasoline and successfully convinced two students at Hobart College to firebomb a campus ROTC building.
[00:29:34.444 --> 00:29:48.042]  Joseph Burton was hired and funded by the FBI to start a group of Maoist radicals that was deployed to the 1972 Republican Convention to encourage peaceful demonstrators to topple a bus and blow it up.
[00:29:49.484 --> 00:29:58.370]  The bomb that killed six people at the World Trade Center in 1993 was built with the help of FBI informant Imad Salem.
[00:29:59.151 --> 00:30:07.757]  After the bombing, the FBI paid Salem over a million dollars to recruit others in a plot to blow up other targets in New York City.
[00:30:10.058 --> 00:30:16.203]  After the 9-11 attacks, the FBI went public with their long secret tradition of entrapment.
[00:30:17.481 --> 00:30:31.253]  In 2004, FBI informant Elda Woody was paid $100,000 to gain the trust of Shawar Sarraj, become his mentor, and turn the conversation towards planning acts of violent terrorism.
[00:30:32.034 --> 00:30:36.878]  For months before his arrest, Sarraj is on record politely trying to say no.
[00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:55.631]  In 2006, FBI informant Ali Assad was paid $85,000 to bully followers of a cult-like group called the Seas of David to swear allegiance to Al-Qaeda, which is all they needed to give five of them long jail sentences.
[00:30:57.156 --> 00:31:04.581]  In 2012, five men in Cleveland were directed and groomed by the FBI to discuss the bombing of a bridge.
[00:31:05.562 --> 00:31:19.912]  In 2015, a week before actual terrorists Elton Simpson and Nadir Hamid Sufi opened fire on a crowd of people in Garland, Texas, an FBI agent commented, tear up Texas on their social media.
[00:31:20.572 --> 00:31:27.503]  That same FBI agent was dressed in Middle Eastern garb and drove behind the perpetrators on their way to the attack.
[00:31:28.284 --> 00:31:30.848]  The FBI claim that this is a coincidence.
[00:31:32.133 --> 00:31:35.295]  These are only a few of the instances that we know of.
[00:31:35.855 --> 00:31:36.636]  There are many more.
[00:31:37.316 --> 00:31:41.138]  The FBI has a long history of unchecked criminal activity.
[00:31:41.839 --> 00:31:46.622]  So it is no surprise to hear that the FBI planned the Governor Whitmer kidnapping.
[00:31:47.342 --> 00:31:48.222]  That is what they do.
[00:31:49.123 --> 00:31:52.405]  What is surprising is that the people are starting to wake up.
[00:31:53.205 --> 00:31:53.786]  And that's good.
[00:31:54.526 --> 00:32:01.056]  Because there are still hundreds of innocent Americans rotting away in jail for the so-called insurrection at the U.S.
[00:32:01.096 --> 00:32:03.039]  Capitol on January 6th.
[00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:08.106]  Another obvious false flag executed by the corrupt U.S.
[00:32:08.146 --> 00:32:09.268]  Department of Justice.
[00:32:10.349 --> 00:32:17.992]  And these same crooked liars are busy trying to lie and deceive us all into a nuclear war with the rest of the world.
[00:32:18.892 --> 00:32:21.713]  So it is a very good time for the people to start waking up.
[00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:24.774]  Our lives will likely depend on it.
[00:32:26.355 --> 00:32:28.616]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:32:29.721 --> 00:32:31.101]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:31.161 --> 00:32:37.403]  I want to get into the death of CNN and the total failure of CNN Plus and what that really signifies here in a few minutes.
[00:32:37.443 --> 00:32:40.583]  And I also want to open the phones up and take your calls next hour, so get ready.
[00:32:41.023 --> 00:32:45.624]  I'll be giving the number out and we'll open the phone system here in about 10 minutes before we end this segment.
[00:32:47.225 --> 00:32:48.545]  I also want to hit the economic news.
[00:32:48.605 --> 00:32:49.665]  It's the most important yet.
[00:32:49.885 --> 00:32:51.766]  The Democratic Party news and what they're planning.
[00:32:53.106 --> 00:32:56.907]  The pedo-grooming and the transgenderism really going to the next level.
[00:32:58.151 --> 00:32:59.952]  But I want to get to this right now.
[00:33:01.892 --> 00:33:06.374]  Study finds Florida handled COVID lockdowns better than New York and California.
[00:33:07.315 --> 00:33:08.635]  And of course, the numbers are all there.
[00:33:08.675 --> 00:33:09.715]  I don't just believe the study.
[00:33:10.176 --> 00:33:12.757]  They have one of the lowest death rates in the country.
[00:33:13.257 --> 00:33:29.965]   And more importantly, as Governor DeSantis pointed out, it is the Democrats and the leaders of these different blue states That we're there vacationing and staying in Florida.
[00:33:30.005 --> 00:33:33.307]  We'll play that clip coming up here in just a moment.
[00:33:34.348 --> 00:33:39.131]  But continuing, anti-lockdown Florida and South Dakota among best pandemic reformers.
[00:33:39.291 --> 00:33:44.434]  Pro-lockdown New York, California among worst major study finds.
[00:33:44.475 --> 00:33:46.196]  You can go read all about that.
[00:33:46.676 --> 00:33:52.893]   A working paper published with the National Bureau of Economic Research Has scored and ranked U.S.
[00:33:52.913 --> 00:33:55.636]  states by their performance over the past two years in three measures.
[00:33:56.056 --> 00:33:57.238]  Health, economy, and education.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:03.125]  They found the states that had no lockdown provisions basically did the best.
[00:34:03.565 --> 00:34:04.066]  Really?
[00:34:04.366 --> 00:34:04.987]  Wow!
[00:34:06.068 --> 00:34:06.829]  How does that work?
[00:34:06.849 --> 00:34:09.012]  Well, there's a lot of reasons for it, ladies and gentlemen, but...
[00:34:11.687 --> 00:34:13.631]  The power structure knew this, was fully aware of it.
[00:34:13.671 --> 00:34:17.039]  Nothing to do with viruses and about keeping people safe.
[00:34:17.059 --> 00:34:21.508]  It was about collapsing and consolidating the economy for total control.
[00:34:22.515 --> 00:34:23.936]  So, here's the headline.
[00:34:24.057 --> 00:34:25.278]  All about politics and control.
[00:34:25.338 --> 00:34:41.252]  Governor DeSantis bashes Democrat COVID theater amid renewed mandates, and again points out if he had a dollar for all the Democrats and globalists on record vacationing in Florida, Florida's size basically got 60% bigger.
[00:34:41.773 --> 00:34:44.315]  All the globalists went there while they kept everybody else on lockdown.
[00:34:44.615 --> 00:34:45.116]  Here's the governor.
[00:34:48.766 --> 00:34:58.071]  In the last week or so, we've seen major outbreaks of COVID-19 among the elite in D.C., including Democrats in Congress, the Biden administration.
[00:34:58.411 --> 00:35:04.014]  How does it feel to read about that news, knowing that the administration has been so critical of your approach to the pandemic?
[00:35:04.778 --> 00:35:11.586]  So just let me say very clearly to all Floridians, you just saw Philadelphia impose an indoor mandate.
[00:35:12.227 --> 00:35:18.574]  You're going to have potentially some of these other deep blue jurisdictions go back to restrictions and mandate.
[00:35:18.794 --> 00:35:20.396]  You look what's happening in Shanghai.
[00:35:20.436 --> 00:35:22.679]  They have everybody under a brutal lockdown.
[00:35:23.099 --> 00:35:24.441]  So I just want to be very clear.
[00:35:24.941 --> 00:35:34.591]   As long as I sit in the chair in which I sit, no Floridian will be restricted, mandated, or locked down in any
[00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:36.441]  possible way.
[00:35:36.441 --> 00:35:41.241]  [Applause]
[00:35:41.241 --> 00:35:46.640]   And so when you see some of these folks who want to impose that, and let's just be clear,
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:54.091]   you look over the last two years, there's a cottage industry that was developed of locked down politicians and
[00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:59.071]   media personalities who would either impose or support locked down policies in
[00:35:41.463 --> 00:35:46.823]   And so when you see some of these folks who want to impose that, and let's just be clear,
[00:35:46.823 --> 00:35:52.863]   you look over the last two years, there's a cottage industry that was developed of lockdown
[00:35:52.863 --> 00:35:58.822]   politicians and media personalities who would either impose or support lockdown policies
[00:35:58.822 --> 00:36:05.182]   in their jurisdictions or advocated on their TV shows, criticized Florida mercilessly,
[00:36:05.182 --> 00:36:10.103]   and then the first chance they get to get out from under the yoke of those bad policies,
[00:36:10.103 --> 00:36:14.623]   you see them in Miami or Palm Beach or all these other places.
[00:36:14.623 --> 00:36:20.063]   And if I had a dollar for every lockdown politician that escaped their own policies to come to
[00:36:20.063 --> 00:36:23.103]  our free state, I would be set for life.
[00:36:23.152 --> 00:36:24.133]  That's just a fact.
[00:36:24.453 --> 00:36:27.295]  Now, some people will say, oh, they're hypocrites, all this stuff.
[00:36:27.315 --> 00:36:28.796]  Yeah, they are, but that's not the issue.
[00:36:29.217 --> 00:36:38.664]   The issue is, is if they thought their policies really were necessary, and these mitigations really were effective, They would be abiding by it.
[00:36:38.944 --> 00:36:44.405]  They're not abiding by it because they know it's all about politics and control.
[00:36:44.705 --> 00:36:46.726]  So that's why they don't wear the mask.
[00:36:46.786 --> 00:36:48.587]  That's why they don't do all this stuff.
[00:36:48.887 --> 00:36:49.147]  That's right.
[00:36:49.167 --> 00:36:51.488]  Because they know it is COVID.
[00:36:52.148 --> 00:36:53.108]  It's COVID theater.
[00:36:53.188 --> 00:37:01.431]  It's power and control designed by the World Economic Forum, Bill Gates, the UN, in operation lockstep by the Rockefellers 12 years ago.
[00:37:02.271 --> 00:37:05.012]  People ask, Jones, how do you predict all this word for word?
[00:37:05.882 --> 00:37:07.043]  Won't be able to go to the ballgame.
[00:37:07.063 --> 00:37:08.204]  Won't be able to go to your job.
[00:37:08.304 --> 00:37:09.185]  You'll have to wear a mask.
[00:37:09.585 --> 00:37:11.607]  It's in the plan, people!
[00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:15.770]  So it's about control.
[00:37:17.331 --> 00:37:18.432]  Suicides tripled.
[00:37:18.792 --> 00:37:19.853]  Drug abuse doubled.
[00:37:20.294 --> 00:37:21.435]  Alcoholism tripled.
[00:37:22.235 --> 00:37:24.617]  I had it wreck members of my family.
[00:37:24.937 --> 00:37:25.778]  It's been horrible.
[00:37:26.058 --> 00:37:28.700]  And I was in a state that was only partially locked down.
[00:37:30.382 --> 00:37:31.723]  Abbott went along with a bunch of this crap.
[00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:36.231]  Thank God Abbott's finally delivered.
[00:37:37.272 --> 00:37:39.874]  DeSantis said he'd do it, but Biden actually did it.
[00:37:40.435 --> 00:37:47.781]  Buses are arriving by the hundreds in D.C., busing the illegals they dump on us to D.C.
[00:37:49.423 --> 00:37:52.165]  I like DeSantis' plan to ship them to Martha's Vineyard, but whatever.
[00:37:54.487 --> 00:37:55.168]  It's insane.
[00:37:55.568 --> 00:38:01.853]  All of this is completely out of control, and it just gets crazier from there on out.
[00:38:03.413 --> 00:38:06.396]  The truth is, when you're out in the sun, viruses die in seconds.
[00:38:06.496 --> 00:38:08.037]  They die inside in minutes.
[00:38:09.398 --> 00:38:10.339]  The studies are out there.
[00:38:10.439 --> 00:38:15.604]  The coronavirus is a very harmless virus in 99% of cases.
[00:38:15.644 --> 00:38:16.985]  There are some mutations that are bad.
[00:38:17.425 --> 00:38:18.906]  They quickly become harmless.
[00:38:19.267 --> 00:38:20.948]  That's how science works, how the body works.
[00:38:22.269 --> 00:38:26.333]  Because the virus doesn't want to kill you, it wants to replicate and live in you and then spawn.
[00:38:27.591 --> 00:38:31.415]  But when you get hit with a new one, you don't understand or know it can kill you because you never experienced it.
[00:38:31.835 --> 00:38:34.458]  But they always mutate where they're harmless.
[00:38:34.498 --> 00:38:35.619]  That's how nature works.
[00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:37.101]  It's how God built it.
[00:38:40.224 --> 00:38:46.691]  Until you get something like coronavirus that's been spiked with other cells and with the HIV delivery system.
[00:38:48.305 --> 00:38:58.135]  Then the coating of the virus itself becomes a toxic nanoparticle, very akin to spongiform encephalopathy, causing prions.
[00:38:59.076 --> 00:39:03.661]  And that's why people are saying, hey, it's in the sewage, it's in the water, it's a poison.
[00:39:03.701 --> 00:39:26.059]   Well, General Flynn said that a year and a half ago, and he said, look, I can't tell you why it's classified, but when he was the head of Defense Intelligence and the head of National Security, The Wuhan Laboratory Group run by Peter Daszak came to the military and said, we want you to buy this synthetic viral protein that is completely synthetic.
[00:39:26.319 --> 00:39:34.622]  You can spray out of helicopters, spray on people, and it's synthetic nanotech made out of HIV delivery system, and it keeps replicating and you can't get rid of it because there's no known cure.
[00:39:35.242 --> 00:39:37.563]  It colonizes you and keeps coming back.
[00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:40.685]  That's why people usually get the flu and never get it for 10 years.
[00:39:41.285 --> 00:39:43.586]  You get COVID, you keep getting it all the time.
[00:39:44.306 --> 00:39:46.147]  And vaccines don't help because they're not vaccines.
[00:39:46.387 --> 00:39:49.287]  They are permanently infecting us with this crap.
[00:39:50.188 --> 00:39:51.828]  And that's what the scientists all now agree.
[00:39:53.769 --> 00:39:59.350]  There are a bunch of chemicals and things that are able to detoxify, and we've talked about that, and we're going to get more into that in the near future.
[00:40:00.651 --> 00:40:04.592]  But the issue everybody needs to understand is, this is not a frickin' game.
[00:40:06.792 --> 00:40:12.914]  And if you don't have vitamin D, and if you don't have zinc, and if you don't have iodine, and if you're not getting good sun, you are up the creek without a paddle.
[00:40:13.194 --> 00:40:15.994]  And that stuff will normally make you invincible to viruses.
[00:40:16.515 --> 00:40:23.356]  With COVID class of bioweapon, nanotech weapon, it only bolsters you and makes it not be as bad.
[00:40:24.597 --> 00:40:28.718]  See, humans regenerate, but not when something cuts our double helix.
[00:40:29.881 --> 00:40:35.291]  And if the spike protein gets enough of a beachhead inside your body and gets into all your organs, you're gonna die.
[00:40:35.611 --> 00:40:36.493]  You're gonna age very quickly.
[00:40:36.773 --> 00:40:38.116]  Look, I age massively from it.
[00:40:38.136 --> 00:40:38.897]  My dad aged from it.
[00:40:39.157 --> 00:40:39.578]  Rob do.
[00:40:39.638 --> 00:40:40.219]  He'll admit it.
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.143]  Looks 10 years older after he got almost killed.
[00:40:44.824 --> 00:40:45.884]  My dad looks 10 years older.
[00:40:46.225 --> 00:40:48.385]  It made me look like 6, 7, 8 years older.
[00:40:48.425 --> 00:40:49.266]  It really messed me up.
[00:40:49.806 --> 00:40:50.306]  It was no joke.
[00:40:50.826 --> 00:40:56.148]  I had to control myself and not go to the hospital when I couldn't breathe because I knew that it was psychosomatic, the way it operates.
[00:40:56.188 --> 00:40:58.309]  And I took steroids and ivermectin and beat it.
[00:40:58.829 --> 00:41:02.711]  But my wife was like, she said, my God, I need to go to the hospital.
[00:41:02.731 --> 00:41:03.091]  I can't breathe.
[00:41:03.111 --> 00:41:04.811]  I said, no, they'll intubate you and kill you.
[00:41:05.092 --> 00:41:05.992]  You got to just ignore that.
[00:41:06.432 --> 00:41:07.953]  I take these steroids and take ivermectin.
[00:41:07.973 --> 00:41:08.673]  She got better quick.
[00:41:09.253 --> 00:41:11.354]  But most people don't have that information until they die.
[00:41:13.515 --> 00:41:14.055]  This isn't a game.
[00:41:15.387 --> 00:41:15.907]  It's in the game.
[00:41:15.927 --> 00:41:21.792]  All right, I got more on this, and I've got the censorship news, and then I'm going to give the number out.

[00:42:32.352 --> 00:42:37.474]  All right, we'll be back, ladies and gentlemen, with your phone calls, more on the COVID fraud.
[00:42:40.129 --> 00:42:42.655]  Latest on the Drag Queen story time, big developments there.
[00:42:42.475 --> 00:42:47.475]   there, the censorship, the inflation, the war in Ukraine and more.
[00:42:47.475 --> 00:43:16.475]  [Music]
[00:43:16.475 --> 00:43:21.475]  April 2022 just kicked off and it's already been incredible.
[00:43:21.787 --> 00:43:33.691]  Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, they along with many other New World Order operatives have gone on national television and announced that we are now under a world government.
[00:43:34.371 --> 00:43:41.293]  They have a summit taking place right now in Dubai titled World Government Summit and they are announcing incredible tyranny.
[00:43:41.793 --> 00:43:46.134]  Everything we've talked about is now coming true and the globalists want to take us off air.
[00:43:47.045 --> 00:43:52.088]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are running the biggest sale in the history of InfoWars right now.
[00:43:52.628 --> 00:44:03.133]  In our 28 years, all InfoWars apparel is being sold at cost until the inventory is gone and we're never going to print these t-shirts and ball caps and InfoWars flags again.
[00:44:03.553 --> 00:44:06.395]  We may have t-shirts and apparel in the future, but I don't even know.
[00:44:06.795 --> 00:44:09.776]  We are blowing out of everything to get emergency funds in right now.
[00:44:10.097 --> 00:44:15.259]  I'm firing the bat signal and asking you to get your t-shirts at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:44:15.318 --> 00:44:17.318]  They're at cost.
[00:44:17.318 --> 00:44:41.837]  I'm going to walk all over you.
[00:44:41.837 --> 00:44:47.639]  You're now into hour number two.
[00:44:47.639 --> 00:44:52.009]   ♪ I can't keep fooling around ♪ Because of your support, we're still here.
[00:44:53.031 --> 00:45:02.031]  Thank you.
[00:45:02.059 --> 00:45:05.183]  I want to play a few clips here out of your phone calls and news in the next segment.
[00:45:05.803 --> 00:45:14.969]   Here's Dr. Malone saying everything we had in hospitals to Insure safety had been suspended and that's the real next-level sign worldwide.
[00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:28.141]  Why are all these governments following the same policy to give people Rendesivir that causes kidney failure and doesn't protect you from the virus, but blocking all these other things that are absolutely 100% effective basically, especially when you use his cocktails.
[00:45:28.501 --> 00:45:29.402]  Here he is talking about it.
[00:45:31.039 --> 00:45:33.221]  Speaking out like this is not an easy thing.
[00:45:33.701 --> 00:45:40.387]  And you're always, at least if you think about it, you're afraid of going too far.
[00:45:41.028 --> 00:45:42.890]  And then you got COVID again.
[00:45:43.936 --> 00:45:44.456]  Yeah, we did.
[00:45:46.877 --> 00:45:51.760]  So that's one of the odd things about taking the vaccine after you have natural immunity.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:59.584]  Now we know it increases your risk for adverse events, which is one of the reasons why we shouldn't be just willy-nilly vaccinating people.
[00:46:01.985 --> 00:46:04.366]  We're not all alike in that way anymore.
[00:46:04.426 --> 00:46:05.867]  We don't have all the same risks.
[00:46:06.686 --> 00:46:14.186]   And there, this growing awareness that there is T-cell damage from the vaccine,
[00:46:14.186 --> 00:46:18.186]   so that it may be that if you're naturally immune and you take the vaccine,
[00:46:18.186 --> 00:46:23.186]   you actually have a less effective immune response than you did before you took the vaccine.
[00:46:23.186 --> 00:46:26.186]  That's still kind of emerging.
[00:46:26.186 --> 00:46:31.686]   But I think there's a lot of merit that has to be looked at really rigorously.
[00:46:31.686 --> 00:46:41.686]   And there's, we're in this landscape where so much is anecdotal because the ability to do the work is suppressed.
[00:46:41.868 --> 00:46:42.769]  It's not funded.
[00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:43.989]  You can't publish it.
[00:46:44.369 --> 00:46:48.071]  And doctors are discouraged to report?
[00:46:48.411 --> 00:46:49.871]  Actively discouraged to report.
[00:46:50.451 --> 00:46:51.672]  Not just doctors.
[00:46:51.772 --> 00:46:54.053]  Nurses, others in the hospital environment.
[00:46:56.594 --> 00:46:59.995]  Pathologists are strongly discouraged to perform autopsies.
[00:47:01.425 --> 00:47:13.950]  All the classic stuff that we have had in our hospital system to ensure safety and effectiveness and appropriateness of medical treatment has been suppressed.
[00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:23.414]  All in this blind rush to, with the logic that anything which would cause vaccine hesitancy is not allowed.
[00:47:23.634 --> 00:47:25.215]  Must be avoided at all costs.
[00:47:25.255 --> 00:47:25.535]  Yeah.
[00:47:26.215 --> 00:47:36.782]  So, out of the gates worldwide, hundreds of countries, under UN directive, the same policy to suppress treatments, suppress the danger, suppress what's really happening, and then we learn it's a globalist weapon.
[00:47:37.442 --> 00:47:47.228]  Of course it is, but the good news is, here's Bill Gates, wherever he goes around the world now, this just happened yesterday, he was going to a TED Talk, being protested outside with Arrest Bill Gates.
[00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:52.091]  Vancouver, Canada.
[00:47:55.454 --> 00:48:05.257]  That's a good couple thousand people.
[00:48:05.097 --> 00:48:07.097]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[00:48:07.097 --> 00:48:09.097]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[00:48:09.097 --> 00:48:11.097]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[00:48:11.097 --> 00:48:13.097]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[00:48:13.097 --> 00:48:15.097]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[00:48:15.097 --> 00:48:17.097]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[00:48:17.097 --> 00:48:19.097]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[00:48:19.097 --> 00:48:21.097]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[00:48:21.097 --> 00:48:23.097]  Arrest Bill Gates!
[00:48:23.097 --> 00:48:25.097]  They're not getting away with this.
[00:48:24.814 --> 00:48:25.795]  We've saw through them.
[00:48:25.815 --> 00:48:30.439]  We've had good scientists and doctors and others come public, and we know.
[00:48:31.399 --> 00:48:35.423]  We warned everybody eight months, nine months before they released the damn shot, what it would do.
[00:48:35.983 --> 00:48:36.924]  We had all the top scientists.
[00:48:36.964 --> 00:48:37.905]  I mean, who's who?
[00:48:38.205 --> 00:48:40.567]  Inventor of mRNA, former Chief Scientist, Pfizer.
[00:48:41.247 --> 00:48:42.668]  The list just goes on and on.
[00:48:42.688 --> 00:48:48.933]  The Chief Scientist of the EU saying, we know what this will do.
[00:48:50.675 --> 00:48:51.876]  We know what's going to happen.
[00:48:53.473 --> 00:48:54.874]  The media is the virus.

[00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:12.694]  And we join with our ancestors and our current brethren and those in the future in eternity.
[00:50:13.054 --> 00:50:15.054]  Because eternity is not enough!
[00:50:15.054 --> 00:50:25.054]  What is greater than eternity is unlimited eternities.
[00:50:25.054 --> 00:50:26.614]  Peace.
[00:50:26.162 --> 00:50:33.162]  and that is the beginning of the mind of God.
[00:50:33.162 --> 00:50:40.162]   I want to take your calls from Chris, Michael, Alex, Rush, Brandon, Vern, Dale, Adam and
[00:50:40.162 --> 00:50:44.162]  others that are patiently holding today.
[00:50:44.162 --> 00:50:45.001]  Take care.
[00:50:45.001 --> 00:50:45.841]  Bye.
[00:50:46.628 --> 00:50:48.389]  Now, I did an okay job last hour.
[00:50:48.409 --> 00:50:56.074]  I hit the mentally ill, schizophrenic, black supremacist that went in there reportedly and shot all these people because they were white.
[00:50:56.895 --> 00:50:58.116]  A terrible situation.
[00:50:59.637 --> 00:51:01.018]  And it flies in the face of the FBI.
[00:51:03.891 --> 00:51:06.593]  Report of the last two years that white people are the number one terror threat.
[00:51:06.953 --> 00:51:09.715]  That doesn't mean there aren't crazy white people who go around shooting black folks.
[00:51:09.775 --> 00:51:11.856]  Look at Dylann Roof and other cases.
[00:51:11.896 --> 00:51:19.962]  But the media is not going to stick the knife in and turn it and tell white people to hate black people like they would have done if a white person would have done this.
[00:51:20.422 --> 00:51:30.789]  But we got plenty of crazy white people, plenty of crazy black people, and that's why people should be armed and trained to protect themselves from people like this individual.
[00:51:32.844 --> 00:51:40.091]  We have, of course, coming out the huge ruling by the verdict, by the jury, saying these people are not guilty.
[00:51:40.191 --> 00:51:41.171]  They didn't attack.
[00:51:41.512 --> 00:51:48.258]  The FBI provocateur-ed them, ordered them to show up, and they were complaining while it was happening that, I don't want to kidnap the governor.
[00:51:48.718 --> 00:51:50.660]  Get in there and do it and cut her head off!
[00:51:52.542 --> 00:51:54.003]  This isn't just infiltrating.
[00:51:54.043 --> 00:51:55.084]  It's not even provocateur-ing.
[00:51:55.144 --> 00:52:03.337]   It's leading attempted Terror attacks to make their minion Whitmer look like a hero.
[00:52:03.357 --> 00:52:07.300]  The same FBI that did that ran January 6 provocateur operations.
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:08.521]  It's now coming out.
[00:52:09.862 --> 00:52:10.423]  We've got that.
[00:52:10.503 --> 00:52:10.903]  I covered it.
[00:52:12.064 --> 00:52:16.848]  And we've got the fact that states that didn't have lockdowns had the lowest death rates and all those statistics.
[00:52:18.541 --> 00:52:21.662]  And then we've got this whole starting of the children, new developments there.
[00:52:22.242 --> 00:52:25.484]  We're going to be getting to the Democrat death march to November.
[00:52:26.164 --> 00:52:27.265]  We have narrative fail.
[00:52:27.305 --> 00:52:34.027]  Only 6% of Americans are buying into Joe Biden's talking point that Russia is to blame for his record inflation.
[00:52:34.507 --> 00:52:38.309]  In new polls, the wheels have come off the establishment.
[00:52:38.749 --> 00:52:41.170]  CNN spent $400 million, wasn't $300, $400 million on CNN+.
[00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:44.690]  wasn't 300, 400 million on CNN plus.
[00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:48.390]  It has less than 10,000 viewers total in a week.
[00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:53.210]   We know that we have listeners tuning in on average listening about 25 minutes.
[00:52:53.645 --> 00:53:00.831]  We know in 25 minutes listening to this show every day, there is conservatively 2 million people tuned in.
[00:53:02.853 --> 00:53:08.658]  So, what's 10,000 divided into 2 million?
[00:53:09.739 --> 00:53:18.566]  I mean, we have dozens and dozens and dozens of times the viewership and listeners of CNN Plus every half hour, every 20 minutes.
[00:53:21.357 --> 00:53:24.100]  Drawing fewer than 10,000 daily users.
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.981]  Actually, it's 10,000 weekly.
[00:53:26.402 --> 00:53:27.663]  CNBC even spun that.
[00:53:29.264 --> 00:53:30.185]  I mean, think of that!
[00:53:31.206 --> 00:53:33.709]  You can't force people to watch CNN.
[00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:52.940]   But Brian Stelter and All these people like Anderson Cooper are these self-appointed individuals that sit up there and call for censorship and control of all their competition because they think if we go away they'll be popular again.
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.743]  You can ban a hundred people, a thousand people a day.
[00:53:56.023 --> 00:53:58.465]  You can take Alex Jones and Joe Rogan off the air tomorrow.
[00:53:58.745 --> 00:54:05.792]  There will be people that fill that vacuum of disagreeing with you and they'll have millions of viewers instantly.
[00:54:06.930 --> 00:54:13.495]  No one can put CNN and MSNBC and the whole corporate media back together again.
[00:54:14.356 --> 00:54:16.317]  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
[00:54:16.437 --> 00:54:18.339]  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.903]  And the greatest example of that is Brian Stelter who is the living embodiment of Humpty Dumpty.
[00:54:24.843 --> 00:54:26.865]  So Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
[00:54:27.185 --> 00:54:29.266]  Humpty Dumpty said we must censor them all.
[00:54:29.727 --> 00:54:31.548]  Humpty Dumpty said only I can speak.
[00:54:32.609 --> 00:54:36.563]   Humpty Dumpty was Ugly and had disgusting feet.
[00:54:37.483 --> 00:54:39.224]  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.
[00:54:39.284 --> 00:54:41.705]  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
[00:54:42.605 --> 00:54:48.087]  All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[00:54:50.288 --> 00:54:51.508]  So what can they do?
[00:54:52.289 --> 00:54:59.491]  They can try to pull us and claw us into the maw, into the hole, into the pit with them.
[00:54:59.812 --> 00:55:02.973]  And the answer is we ain't buying your chili.
[00:55:04.008 --> 00:55:06.310]  We're not going along with you.
[00:55:07.911 --> 00:55:09.712]  We're not accepting your BS.
[00:55:10.053 --> 00:55:17.839]  We break with you, and no, we're not going to have the civil war you want, and we're not going to go shoot the cops like you want, and we're not going to attack federal buildings like you want.
[00:55:18.339 --> 00:55:32.510]  We're just going to sit here and culturally withdraw our support from all your systems, and speak out against you, and most importantly, build our own systems, and pray to God to lead God to direct us.
[00:55:34.346 --> 00:55:42.372]  So they can sit around in their chairs and have the Atlantic, monthly, owned by Steve Jobs' wife, who was one of the most frequent visitors to Epstein Island.
[00:55:43.032 --> 00:55:46.795]  And they can sit up there and pontificate about how only they're real and everybody else is fake.
[00:55:49.357 --> 00:55:51.759]  But at the end of the day, everybody knows.
[00:55:55.121 --> 00:55:58.964]  Everybody knows who they are and what they are.
[00:56:03.584 --> 00:56:04.264]  And where they're going.
[00:56:06.846 --> 00:56:13.350]  You know, we always turn him into It the Clown, but It the Clown's almost more lovable than Brian Stelter.
[00:56:17.293 --> 00:56:20.015]  It's not even fair to, like, make him turn into the clown on TV.
[00:56:20.175 --> 00:56:22.056]  It's better just to show his real face.
[00:56:22.076 --> 00:56:22.356]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:22.676 --> 00:56:23.777]  Please don't turn back into the clown.
[00:56:23.817 --> 00:56:27.900]  That's scarier looking than It, because that's real.
[00:56:29.679 --> 00:56:35.161]  Why would the, why would Time Warner, why would AT&T want to put that on TV?
[00:56:35.421 --> 00:56:47.665]  Because they want to force ugliness and evil and fraud and lies on you because they're hunchbacked and they're ugly spiritually and they like the fact that they're forcing their ugliness on us.
[00:56:49.125 --> 00:56:51.806]  Their spiritual ugliness, their filth on us.
[00:56:53.807 --> 00:56:54.607]  I'm gonna stop ranting.
[00:56:55.988 --> 00:56:56.768]  I'm gonna go to your calls.
[00:56:59.107 --> 00:57:00.968]  And then I need to get into the censorship news.
[00:57:01.048 --> 00:57:05.950]  I need to get into this, this, this, this, this pedo news.
[00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:07.730]  But let's hit this right now, briefly.
[00:57:08.851 --> 00:57:12.912]  Joe Biden came out, as you know, yesterday.
[00:57:14.213 --> 00:57:15.713]  The video is on Infowars.com.
[00:57:16.654 --> 00:57:21.516]  And he said, well, you got to hear this for yourself.
[00:57:22.876 --> 00:57:29.715]   He said that they've got to legalize blaming gun manufacturers for shootings.
[00:57:29.715 --> 00:57:33.516]   Well, next you're going to blame somebody who uses a baseball bat to kill somebody,
[00:57:33.516 --> 00:57:37.715]  or a butcher knife, or a car.
[00:57:37.715 --> 00:57:42.555]   But notice the same law firm, remember the Democrats, is trying to sue me out of business.
[00:57:42.555 --> 00:57:47.555]   It's the same one that got the Remington situation, and they're now the ones filing lawsuits against
[00:57:47.555 --> 00:57:51.715]   gun manufacturers everywhere to shut them down, just like they're able to try to shut
[00:57:51.715 --> 00:57:54.036]  us down with their fake lawsuits.
[00:57:54.036 --> 00:57:58.196]   They believe they can then shut down all the other patriots and resistance out there with
[00:57:58.196 --> 00:58:00.915]  picked, kept juries and pet judges.
[00:58:00.915 --> 00:58:04.536]  And that's their stratagem, and that is their overall plan.
[00:58:04.536 --> 00:58:08.915]   But here's Biden, can't even get it right when he's saying we need to...
[00:58:09.884 --> 00:58:15.008]  Go after gun manufacturers, and then he butchers it and brings in prostitutes somehow.
[00:58:15.068 --> 00:58:15.488]  Here it is.
[00:58:16.048 --> 00:58:21.212]  I said, what do you think, the deer you're hunting, wear Kevlar vests, what the hell you need 20 bullets for?
[00:58:21.552 --> 00:58:23.314]  You must be a hell of a terrible shot.
[00:58:24.395 --> 00:58:25.695]  I'm serious, think about it.
[00:58:26.516 --> 00:58:27.917]  Think about the mass shootings!
[00:58:27.937 --> 00:58:30.759]  As many as a hundred rounds!
[00:58:32.861 --> 00:58:34.001]  It's a weapon of war!
[00:58:34.021 --> 00:58:38.825]  It has nothing to do with recreation.
[00:58:40.137 --> 00:58:45.359]  I'll write banning the sale and possession of un-serialized guns.
[00:58:46.059 --> 00:58:48.740]  Eliminate gun manufacturers' immunity from liability.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:49.800]  They're the only outfit.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:54.281]  They're the only outfit in the country that is immune.
[00:58:55.682 --> 00:59:00.843]  Imagine had the tobacco industry been immune to prostitutes being sued.
[00:59:01.583 --> 00:59:01.923]  Come on.
[00:59:02.884 --> 00:59:03.104]  Yep.
[00:59:04.024 --> 00:59:07.385]  Gun manufacturers and the tobacco companies are immune to prostitutes.
[00:59:10.598 --> 00:59:16.845]  Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools.
[00:59:16.885 --> 00:59:22.991]  We laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool.
[00:59:24.750 --> 00:59:57.140]   It's beautiful out this deep The melody settles down over me I'm not bored or unhappy I'm still so strange and wild I'm in the wind, I'm in the water Nobody's son, nobody's daughter Watching the chemtrails over the country club Suburbia, the Bramwood Market, what to do next?
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:06.286]  Maybe we'll have it, white picking and shares over the country club.
[01:00:06.586 --> 01:00:17.586]   My love, oh, oh, my love, oh, oh Washing my hair, doing my laundry,
[01:00:17.586 --> 01:00:23.086]   Look at TV, I'm on TV Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are back and we're about
[01:00:23.086 --> 01:00:23.586]  to go straight to your phone calls.
[01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:25.836]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:00:25.856 --> 01:00:30.917]  Got a lot of news I'm gonna hit, but let's just get to your calls right now.
[01:00:30.937 --> 01:00:33.157]  I look really forward to talking to you.
[01:00:34.478 --> 01:00:39.119]  Let's go ahead and talk to Adam in New Jersey.
[01:00:39.259 --> 01:00:40.159]  Adam, thank you for calling.
[01:00:40.179 --> 01:00:40.599]  You're on the air.
[01:00:42.125 --> 01:00:44.207]  Alex, it's a pleasure to be talking to you, man.
[01:00:44.227 --> 01:00:46.348]  I just want to let you know you are the tip of the spear.
[01:00:46.368 --> 01:00:47.829]  Thank you for everything that you do.
[01:00:48.410 --> 01:00:50.211]  I want to take up a little bit of your time, man.
[01:00:50.491 --> 01:00:55.875]  I live in Jersey, and I just feel like this whole thing going on in Brooklyn, it just seems all too convenient.
[01:00:55.895 --> 01:00:57.937]  We've seen this move by the globalists before.
[01:00:58.257 --> 01:01:01.479]  They overplay their hand, and then they go quickly to the other side.
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:05.702]  It's just not adding up over here, and I just wanted to get your thoughts on that.
[01:01:05.722 --> 01:01:06.743]  Well, give us your view on it.
[01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:09.865]  Conveniently, the camera failed.
[01:01:10.226 --> 01:01:13.348]  They said of the thousands of cameras, that's the one area where they failed.
[01:01:14.689 --> 01:01:15.930]  That's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:21.074]  It seems too coincidental and they just happened to find... Well, you're not supposed to ask questions, sir.
[01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:22.515]  Just go back to sleep.
[01:01:22.555 --> 01:01:22.775]  Come on.
[01:01:23.755 --> 01:01:25.277]  Yeah, that's my problem.
[01:01:25.358 --> 01:01:25.858]  I'm awake.
[01:01:26.559 --> 01:01:31.166]  And, you know, they find the U-Haul there, and they have all these videos of his social media.
[01:01:31.507 --> 01:01:36.574]  If he was some mastermind, why does he have all these videos basically saying he's crazy out there?
[01:01:36.895 --> 01:01:38.197]  And now it's suddenly this guy?
[01:01:38.257 --> 01:01:39.299]  It doesn't make sense to me, Alex.
[01:01:40.612 --> 01:01:42.974]  Well, they got rid of the mental institutions in the 80s.
[01:01:43.014 --> 01:01:44.296]  There are a lot of crazy people.
[01:01:44.376 --> 01:01:48.159]  And the FBI did try to go after him, but higher-ups blocked it because it didn't fit the narrative.
[01:01:48.199 --> 01:01:50.802]  If he'd been a white crazy, they'd have gone after him because that fits the narrative.
[01:01:51.463 --> 01:01:53.425]  I mean, I don't know if it was a staged event.
[01:01:53.465 --> 01:01:54.606]  I don't know if it was provocateur.
[01:01:55.447 --> 01:01:57.148]  But we'll continue to watch it as it develops.
[01:01:57.168 --> 01:01:58.129]  What else is on your mind, brother?
[01:01:58.149 --> 01:01:58.990]  You want to talk about Russia?
[01:02:00.311 --> 01:02:01.593]  Ah, Russia's crazy right now.
[01:02:01.633 --> 01:02:02.554]  That's the other thing too.
[01:02:02.614 --> 01:02:07.219]  First, you know, Zelensky, he needs our help and now he's saying that we're cowards for not helping.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:14.208]  He wasn't in NATO and with everything going on, Ukraine's filled with Nazis and no one wants to report on that.
[01:02:14.508 --> 01:02:17.732]  Well, I love two weeks after the Russians pull out from around Kiev.
[01:02:19.215 --> 01:02:28.538]  Then Zelensky and Boris Johnson march around like they're in a combat zone, with no craters, no dead people, no snipers, in a city that Putin says he's not going to attack.
[01:02:28.998 --> 01:02:30.538]  I mean, it's just preposterous.
[01:02:31.799 --> 01:02:32.999]  It's absolutely crazy.
[01:02:33.099 --> 01:02:36.920]  And they're making all this up, saying there's a ton of attempts on his life.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.480]  This is the Russians we're dealing with.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.961]  They're a competent military.
[01:02:40.261 --> 01:02:41.021]  They're making it all up.
[01:02:41.061 --> 01:02:42.602]  If they wanted him dead, they'd have taken him out.
[01:02:42.622 --> 01:02:43.802]  But that's not the way Putin works.
[01:02:45.305 --> 01:02:48.788]  Well, I don't want to over-lionize the Russian military.
[01:02:50.109 --> 01:02:50.449]  The U.S.
[01:02:50.469 --> 01:02:51.970]  military is in constant war.
[01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:54.272]  That's why it's one of the best, if not the best, in the world.
[01:02:55.373 --> 01:02:57.254]  The Russians have not been in a bunch of wars in a while.
[01:02:57.314 --> 01:02:58.075]  Will Russians fight?
[01:02:58.135 --> 01:02:58.635]  Absolutely.
[01:02:59.095 --> 01:03:01.897]  But, I mean, you've got Russians fighting Russians, basically, in Ukraine.
[01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:04.279]  And it's a bloodbath.
[01:03:04.299 --> 01:03:04.900]  You've had the U.S.
[01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:06.281]  military and special forces there.
[01:03:08.783 --> 01:03:15.688]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:16.949 --> 01:03:19.611]  Currently, Putin is getting smashed.
[01:03:20.591 --> 01:03:22.733]  And I said Putin went into a trap when it first happened.
[01:03:24.874 --> 01:03:26.816]  This will make Afghanistan look like a cakewalk.
[01:03:27.556 --> 01:03:30.458]  That means Soros and the globalists are to blame for starting this.
[01:03:31.079 --> 01:03:33.561]  But it doesn't mean I'm going to go, oh, look, Putin's doing a great job.
[01:03:33.641 --> 01:03:34.862]  Oh, you're so smart to go in there.
[01:03:35.737 --> 01:03:36.858]  No, Putin's finding out.
[01:03:36.878 --> 01:03:39.319]  I mean, look, Putin's not dumb, I'll give you that.
[01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:41.721]  What did he think was waiting for him when he went into there?
[01:03:44.223 --> 01:03:44.703]  What did he think?
[01:03:46.444 --> 01:03:55.430]  All the Special Forces units of Europe and the Delta Force and the rest of them for a decade training the Ukrainians with high-tech weapons.
[01:03:57.511 --> 01:04:01.734]  We're in a tank some mile away or two miles away, you just aim, fire, it hits the target.
[01:04:04.804 --> 01:04:05.765]  And Putin did know that.
[01:04:05.805 --> 01:04:11.589]  He knew that NATO was moving in about to overthrow Ukraine, and they already overthrown an election regime, and he made the decision to go in.
[01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:13.771]  So he just said, screw it, I'm going to fight.
[01:04:15.272 --> 01:04:17.854]  And the Russians are getting annihilated.
[01:04:18.815 --> 01:04:27.902]  Because they've got high-tech ballistic missiles and high-tech long-range systems, but they just do not have switchblade drones like the USS.
[01:04:28.983 --> 01:04:34.107]  They've dumped over 100,000 switchblade drones in that a one man can have two on his back.
[01:04:34.989 --> 01:04:39.190]  Launch it with a target and take out vehicles and armored vehicles and you name it.
[01:04:40.590 --> 01:04:41.591]  It's a small cruise missile.
[01:04:42.551 --> 01:04:45.452]  I mean, the US is 30 years ahead of Russia.
[01:04:46.252 --> 01:04:48.473]  Russia might as well be fighting space aliens right now.
[01:04:50.693 --> 01:04:52.254]  And so that's what's happening.
[01:04:52.274 --> 01:05:02.735]   You've got a 1980s army that is rolling in against basically Martian technology. I mean, I would describe it
[01:05:02.735 --> 01:05:07.786]   like that. I mean, it's all the Russians could do if they wanted to win this now, which is
[01:05:07.786 --> 01:05:13.376]   nuke the major cities. And then he'd be a war criminal. And I mean, he wants to. But now the Ukrainians
[01:05:13.376 --> 01:05:15.204]  are motivated. They're dug in.
[01:05:15.204 --> 01:05:20.565]   They've got high tech weapons. And unless the Russians flatten every city, they're not going
[01:05:20.565 --> 01:05:24.405]   to be able to take the country, which they're putting claims he's not doing.
[01:05:24.674 --> 01:05:35.018]  But he can't even win the East part right now, because the United States, the people that run our country, have been there for a decade training serious commando units for this.
[01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:42.681]  They all speak the same language, they look the same, so the groups can infiltrate back and forth across sides.
[01:05:43.162 --> 01:05:44.662]  The ultimate proxy war.
[01:05:45.743 --> 01:05:52.502]   It'd be like having Arkansas and Oklahoma go to war with Texas.
[01:05:56.307 --> 01:05:57.248]  And Texas is Russia.
[01:05:57.268 --> 01:05:58.269]  It's bigger, more people.
[01:05:58.309 --> 01:06:02.434]  But Oklahoma and Arkansas, they basically talk the same, look the same.
[01:06:02.834 --> 01:06:03.575]  They're not wimps.
[01:06:03.795 --> 01:06:04.276]  What's going to happen?
[01:06:04.296 --> 01:06:05.157]  They're going to kill each other.
[01:06:05.177 --> 01:06:05.778]  It's not going to stop.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:10.925]  I mean, imagine if Texas went to war against Oklahoma and Arkansas.
[01:06:10.965 --> 01:06:11.506]  How would that go?
[01:06:11.526 --> 01:06:13.629]  You're like, well, there's more Texans than them.
[01:06:14.009 --> 01:06:15.331]  Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
[01:06:15.852 --> 01:06:16.753]  It's going to be a bloodbath.
[01:06:17.514 --> 01:06:19.617]  And you can't tell who's who.
[01:06:22.674 --> 01:06:27.516]  That's why in the old days people wear military uniforms, because at least it's chivalrous, you know who you're facing.
[01:06:27.716 --> 01:06:28.376]  We're going to go to break.
[01:06:28.456 --> 01:06:29.696]  I only got to one caller in that segment.
[01:06:29.956 --> 01:06:32.217]  I want to get to like six, seven, eight callers in the next segment.
[01:06:32.477 --> 01:06:37.819]  I want to get everybody on the board before Ali Alexander joins us, coming up here in about 35 minutes.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:39.700]  In studio.
[01:06:40.971 --> 01:06:42.692]  Separately, I really need your support.
[01:06:42.732 --> 01:06:44.373]  I'm not going to sit here and bitch and complain.
[01:06:44.473 --> 01:06:48.276]  I just need your support, or we won't be able to fund the operation with all the attacks we're under.
[01:06:49.097 --> 01:06:50.678]  And more than ever now, we need your support.

[01:07:55.319 --> 01:08:02.242]  We're about to go to Brandon in Texas wants to talk about supply chain breakdowns and shortages in baby formula.
[01:08:03.203 --> 01:08:12.437]   I personally, this weekend, went to three grocery stores to see for myself And these are grocery stores that are never sparse, and they were half empty or more.
[01:08:12.857 --> 01:08:16.778]  And Texas is one of the most food-independent states in the United States.
[01:08:17.278 --> 01:08:21.180]  In a country that is the most food-independent in the world.
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:33.664]  So I'm in the best state, if not the second best state, in America, that's the best country in the world, and I saw for myself there was no baby formula.
[01:08:34.502 --> 01:08:36.223]  Not that I have a baby anymore, but I went and looked.
[01:08:36.303 --> 01:08:37.284]  I don't just believe the news.
[01:08:37.364 --> 01:08:38.465]  I want to eyeball this.
[01:08:38.885 --> 01:08:41.046]  Hell, I got footage on my iPhone of it.
[01:08:41.667 --> 01:08:42.287]  And there it was.
[01:08:42.307 --> 01:08:43.127]  Here's some of the headlines.
[01:08:43.588 --> 01:08:44.508]  Narrative fail.
[01:08:44.548 --> 01:08:50.112]  Only 6% of Americans are buying Joe Biden's talking point that Russia is to blame for the record inflation.
[01:08:51.253 --> 01:08:55.655]  UK households incomes obliterated by inflation storm as living standards plunge.
[01:08:56.196 --> 01:08:57.016]  Biden economy.
[01:08:57.136 --> 01:09:02.760]  Average American lost 2.7% in earning power in March alone due to the massive inflation.
[01:09:04.252 --> 01:09:05.753]  It just goes on and on.
[01:09:05.773 --> 01:09:06.974]  I got a giant stack here.
[01:09:07.574 --> 01:09:14.758]  Russia's lower house voices opposition proposals to suspending gas supplies to Europe.
[01:09:15.638 --> 01:09:21.462]  Russia's lower house voices proposals on suspending gas supplies to EU countries.
[01:09:22.282 --> 01:09:26.564]  Food shortages loom as Chinese farmers face trouble amid pandemic.
[01:09:26.584 --> 01:09:27.325]  It's all over the world.
[01:09:28.792 --> 01:09:29.653]  It goes on and on.
[01:09:30.013 --> 01:09:32.995]  But right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:35.157]  Let's talk to Brandon in Texas.
[01:09:35.197 --> 01:09:36.238]  Brandon, thanks for calling.
[01:09:37.519 --> 01:09:38.780]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:09:39.741 --> 01:09:45.245]  I just wanted to call and kind of bring that up, the situation with the baby formula.
[01:09:45.545 --> 01:09:53.371]  Mostly in regards to now, most retailers are actually limiting the amount that consumers can actually buy.
[01:09:54.052 --> 01:10:02.377]   And I kind of want to get your thoughts on that and what other kind of off-topic subject is with the food production here in the
[01:10:02.377 --> 01:10:07.637]   United States with the Chinese coming over here and buying up all of our farmland along
[01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:08.547]  with Bill Gates.
[01:10:08.547 --> 01:10:12.826]  What do you expect moving forward for our food supply chain?
[01:10:12.826 --> 01:10:19.426]   Well, I said it years ago, when they globally devalue the currency and when they get the
[01:10:19.426 --> 01:10:24.746]   general public not to work anymore with universal basic income, land and agriculture are going
[01:10:24.746 --> 01:10:30.107]   to be one of the most valuable things after raw minerals, rare earth minerals like lithium
[01:10:30.107 --> 01:10:31.106]  and other things.
[01:10:31.106 --> 01:10:31.106]  So yeah.
[01:10:31.106 --> 01:10:32.106]  So yeah.
[01:10:32.372 --> 01:10:41.618]  The globalists are in a race with all their fiat money to buy up all the infrastructure, all the land, all the production facilities they can, because that in the future is going to be everything.
[01:10:41.859 --> 01:10:44.220]  Everyone in the future is going to want to live in the country.
[01:10:44.701 --> 01:10:50.525]  Everyone in the future is not going to want to live in a giant third-world slave grid, high-tech death grid city.
[01:10:52.626 --> 01:10:58.430]  Yeah, and in particular, I mean, look at what's happening over in Shanghai, you know.
[01:10:58.849 --> 01:11:03.351]  One of China's most populous cities with the amount of food shortage that's going on over there.
[01:11:03.671 --> 01:11:07.373]  And all of it, again, they're getting China ready for the worldwide collapse.
[01:11:07.393 --> 01:11:15.196]  They're already doing their drills on how to lock down one of their biggest cities because they know this is part of an economic warfare plan and China wants to be ready.
[01:11:16.297 --> 01:11:16.737]  Exactly.
[01:11:17.017 --> 01:11:17.417]  Exactly.
[01:11:17.678 --> 01:11:18.718]  Killing all the dogs.
[01:11:19.158 --> 01:11:20.139]  Killing all the cats.
[01:11:20.199 --> 01:11:21.499]  Who would believe that before?
[01:11:21.899 --> 01:11:22.960]  But this is what they're doing.
[01:11:25.393 --> 01:11:27.194]  Well, Alex, I just want to take a little of your time today.
[01:11:27.234 --> 01:11:31.535]  I appreciate you taking my call and, you know, Alex Jones is right.
[01:11:32.315 --> 01:11:33.556]  Well, I wish I wasn't right, brother.
[01:11:33.596 --> 01:11:34.556]  Thank you so much, Brandon.
[01:11:34.576 --> 01:11:34.856]  Love you.
[01:11:35.517 --> 01:11:40.378]  All right, up next here, let's go to Michael in Nebraska.
[01:11:40.438 --> 01:11:41.899]  Michael, you're on the air.
[01:11:41.919 --> 01:11:44.300]  I want to talk about your father had the Pfizer shot.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:44.960]  And what happened?
[01:11:46.661 --> 01:11:47.301]  Hey, Alex.
[01:11:47.521 --> 01:11:48.621]  It's actually Michelle.
[01:11:49.041 --> 01:11:49.441]  I'm sorry.
[01:11:49.461 --> 01:11:50.542]  In the distance, I read it wrong.
[01:11:50.562 --> 01:11:51.502]  I apologize, Michelle.
[01:11:51.522 --> 01:11:51.762]  That's OK.
[01:11:51.782 --> 01:11:52.383]  No worries.
[01:11:54.278 --> 01:11:59.380]  I appreciate you very much and your willingness and dedication.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:08.002]  Honestly, I was pregnant when I started listening to you and chose not to get the vaccination after educating myself.
[01:12:08.883 --> 01:12:17.585]  Unfortunately, and my baby and I are healthy, my other kids are healthy, but my father, I'm his power of attorney.
[01:12:19.491 --> 01:12:22.852]  Two years ago, he was riding his bike nine miles a day.
[01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:23.452]  Wow.
[01:12:23.592 --> 01:12:25.712]  So very in shape.
[01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:32.253]  Elderly, yes, but very in shape and exercise every day.
[01:12:33.253 --> 01:12:37.694]  And now he can barely walk to his mailbox without getting out of breath.
[01:12:38.634 --> 01:12:48.956]  So I took him to the VA, the former vet, and I wanted some blood work done because he's had three thoughts.
[01:12:50.588 --> 01:12:57.570]  And the doctor acted like I was crazy because I explained why I wanted this blood work done.
[01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:09.092]  And I had previously, before we went, I told my dad what I was concerned about, which is vaccine-induced autoimmune deficiency syndrome.
[01:13:09.112 --> 01:13:14.334]  And the doctor literally acted like I was crazy.
[01:13:14.354 --> 01:13:15.974]  Yeah, they gaslight you.
[01:13:15.994 --> 01:13:19.435]  Even though it's in all their literature and they know it's real, they gaslight you.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:24.703]  He acted like it was the first time he was hearing this information.
[01:13:25.284 --> 01:13:29.547]  And he is one of the main doctors at the VA.
[01:13:30.327 --> 01:13:37.032]  And so I educated him on what I knew, and he refused to do an HIV test.
[01:13:37.693 --> 01:13:39.434]  So I said, what are the other options?
[01:13:40.111 --> 01:13:43.874]  I want to know my dad's CD4 count and CD8 count.
[01:13:43.894 --> 01:13:51.000]  And by the way, you can show people piles of mainstream news that a lot of people that have had these shots come up positive for HIV, and that's the big secret.
[01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.301]  I mean, this is so incredible.
[01:13:53.923 --> 01:14:03.070]  Being that his symptoms were, in my opinion, directly caused by something that was injected into him.
[01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:08.455]  So, after arguing about this test, he said he would order a lymphocyte test.
[01:14:09.474 --> 01:14:13.595]  I followed up a week later, and he said he'd ordered it.
[01:14:13.615 --> 01:14:17.437]  The director of nursing told me he didn't order it.
[01:14:17.457 --> 01:14:19.838]  So I said, you tell him.
[01:14:19.878 --> 01:14:21.058]  It was a Friday afternoon.
[01:14:21.078 --> 01:14:29.341]  I said, you tell him to call me back before 5 o'clock today before he leaves that building, because I want to know why he didn't order that test I told him to order.
[01:14:29.361 --> 01:14:33.162]  And long story short, he said there was some issue.
[01:14:33.783 --> 01:14:34.963]  He reordered the test.
[01:14:35.566 --> 01:14:39.911]  I had to take my dad back there to get another blood draw, because the time had lapsed.
[01:14:40.892 --> 01:14:44.156]  And so, I got the results back last week.
[01:14:44.837 --> 01:14:51.104]  And before I called today, I prayed to God that it will be done, God.
[01:14:51.885 --> 01:14:54.508]  Because I honestly didn't think I would get through to you.
[01:14:55.128 --> 01:14:56.310]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:14:57.139 --> 01:14:58.220]  And I did get through.
[01:14:58.660 --> 01:15:01.822]  You were meant to be on air and we'll put you on hold until later if you want to show us the results.
[01:15:01.862 --> 01:15:03.303]  We'll black out his name.
[01:15:04.664 --> 01:15:06.865]  So you finally got the test back.
[01:15:07.145 --> 01:15:08.226]  Michelle, what did you find out?
[01:15:08.246 --> 01:15:17.211]  I found out that total T-cells, that's the low end.
[01:15:19.453 --> 01:15:30.914]   The CD4, which is the T4 helper cells, That is actually... I want to hear this, but your phone's breaking up, so back away from it or get right on it again.
[01:15:31.034 --> 01:15:32.874]  Can you hear me?
[01:15:33.374 --> 01:15:35.194]  I'm not moving.
[01:15:35.254 --> 01:15:38.275]  I can hear you better now.
[01:15:38.335 --> 01:15:39.655]  Start over with what's in the report.
[01:15:41.716 --> 01:15:43.856]  In the report, the T-cells.
[01:15:44.096 --> 01:15:46.077]  I wanted to know his T-cells.
[01:15:46.937 --> 01:15:47.757]  And they're low.
[01:15:48.737 --> 01:15:49.718]  The B-cells.
[01:15:50.438 --> 01:15:51.358]  B as in boy.
[01:15:52.099 --> 01:15:53.660]  Those are also low.
[01:15:54.301 --> 01:16:00.745]  The CD8 cells, those are your absolute suppressor cells, low.
[01:16:01.846 --> 01:16:06.369]  And then the T4-T8 ratio, high.
[01:16:07.369 --> 01:16:08.490]  And it's very high.
[01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:21.239]  So I looked up what does T4-T8 ratio high mean, and I got instantly on WebMD, Hodgkin's lymphoma.
[01:16:22.321 --> 01:16:34.988]  So I want you and your listeners to know, as much hearsay as people are saying that no, it's not real, it's not affecting your T-cells, I have proof that it is.
[01:16:35.828 --> 01:16:42.591]   And I feel horrible that I let him get this It was out of my control to be honest.
[01:16:42.611 --> 01:16:43.833]  Don't feel bad.
[01:16:43.872 --> 01:16:49.812]   That's what the German scientists have said is that they found massive increases in lymphoma,
[01:16:49.812 --> 01:16:54.631]   Hodgkin's lymphoma, and people that already had cancer that were under cancer treatment
[01:16:54.631 --> 01:16:58.631]   being observed in a big study in Germany that took these Pfizer Moderna shots.
[01:16:58.631 --> 01:17:01.032]  It just grew cancers at levels never before seen.
[01:17:01.032 --> 01:17:06.032]   We're talking about cancers doubling in a week that would take six months to double.
[01:17:06.032 --> 01:17:08.391]  We're talking just explosive cancer growth.
[01:17:08.391 --> 01:17:09.391]  God bless your father.
[01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:10.591]  I'm so sorry they did that.
[01:17:10.591 --> 01:17:12.832]  But yeah, they want to exterminate everybody.
[01:17:12.837 --> 01:17:14.359]  This is a depopulation operation.
[01:17:14.719 --> 01:17:16.460]  They want to set the president to do it.
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:17.461]  This is mass culling.
[01:17:17.902 --> 01:17:18.362]  God bless you.
[01:17:18.382 --> 01:17:19.463]  Thank you for the call, Michelle.
[01:17:19.924 --> 01:17:24.247]  You know, during the break, I was just rereading the ratings for CNN Plus.
[01:17:25.148 --> 01:17:26.930]  $400 million plus in investment.
[01:17:28.591 --> 01:17:30.373]  And it has less than 10,000 viewers a week.
[01:17:31.073 --> 01:17:32.274]  That's almost impossible.
[01:17:33.174 --> 01:17:42.604]  You can't make people watch it at gunpoint, but imagine the arrogance of them looking at our successful system, or Fox Nation, or Joe Rogan.
[01:17:43.390 --> 01:17:47.832]  Where people will come online and watch something, they will support it.
[01:17:48.732 --> 01:17:51.734]  And they thought, well, we'll just go do what they've done, we'll be successful.
[01:17:51.794 --> 01:17:51.974]  No.
[01:17:52.434 --> 01:17:56.256]  You're the most uncool, biggest lying failures anywhere.
[01:17:56.636 --> 01:17:58.377]  You are beyond rejection.
[01:17:58.717 --> 01:18:06.501]  You can't even get 10,000 of your drooling minion viewers on mainline CNN, that itself is a total black hole.
[01:18:07.161 --> 01:18:08.742]  Less than 100,000 viewers per hour.
[01:18:09.102 --> 01:18:11.503]  You can't get them to go to your online platform.
[01:18:12.878 --> 01:18:15.339]  Because your zombie listeners probably don't even know how to do it.
[01:18:16.759 --> 01:18:24.401]  Think about what that says about these self-appointed, officious, sanctimonious, arrogant losers.
[01:18:25.941 --> 01:18:39.725]  You can laugh at them all day, they still got the power structure behind them, but what does it say about the power structure on average, like 85 years old, that really believes CNN's getting us, or their lawsuits against us, or their lies are going to silence us?
[01:18:40.572 --> 01:18:44.076]  You could take Alex Jones and Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson off the air tomorrow.
[01:18:44.917 --> 01:18:46.518]  And you would just create more resistance.
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:49.762]  The question is though, how do they stop us?
[01:18:49.802 --> 01:18:51.724]  With wars, with famine and collapse.
[01:18:52.044 --> 01:18:54.426]  So you think they're just gonna go away because everybody turned against them?
[01:18:54.867 --> 01:18:59.191]  And their pedophilia and their transgenderism and their devaluation of currencies and their devil worship?
[01:18:59.231 --> 01:18:59.392]  No!
[01:19:02.025 --> 01:19:07.028]  They are going to implode everything and starve us to death so they can still run our lives.
[01:19:07.348 --> 01:19:18.815]  But if we identify them and say no to them and stand up to them and through the states and the legislatures and the cities, humanity will want to be successful and want to survive and we will fully reject these people and get them off our backs.
[01:19:20.213 --> 01:19:23.015]  Because in the old days, an authoritarian state had to have support, really, to win.
[01:19:23.695 --> 01:19:25.797]  Now they're an authoritarian state, but they're a shadow state.
[01:19:26.237 --> 01:19:26.817]  A deep state.
[01:19:27.658 --> 01:19:29.219]  We have to get rid of the shadow state.
[01:19:29.719 --> 01:19:31.720]  We have to expose it and shine light on it.
[01:19:32.461 --> 01:19:35.463]  And spotlight the cockroaches, as my good friend Ted Nugent likes to say.
[01:19:35.983 --> 01:19:37.104]  Alright, let's go back to calls.
[01:19:37.124 --> 01:19:38.044]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:19:38.404 --> 01:19:40.026]  That's Chris in the great state of Texas.
[01:19:40.386 --> 01:19:41.066]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:19:41.086 --> 01:19:41.386]  Welcome.
[01:19:42.067 --> 01:19:43.768]  Hi, Alex.
[01:19:44.301 --> 01:19:45.401]  Great to talk with you.
[01:19:45.601 --> 01:20:20.274]   It's no coincidence that you were going to talk about censorship today, Alex, because when I got home last night, I have AT&T U-verse cable system, and I went to OAN because I don't like to watch Fox News until Tucker comes on, and I see that OAN is not there, so I do some research, and I find out that AT&T Because of OAN's content does not match up with the politicians in our country, the Democrat politicians.
[01:20:20.554 --> 01:20:23.355]  Yeah, and of course AT&T owns and runs CNN, yeah.
[01:20:25.259 --> 01:20:26.539]  Yes sir, that's a good point.
[01:20:26.639 --> 01:20:36.361]  And again, here's the thing, that was announced two months ago, and OAN ran banners every hour saying, go to our website, go to Cloud TV, go to Roku, go other places.
[01:20:36.982 --> 01:20:41.863]  But only once they got dumped, when the date came, I'm getting all these calls, where's OAN?
[01:20:41.983 --> 01:20:47.324]  And I'm not mad at listeners for my show or them, because I'm not in competition with OAN, I love them, they're great guys.
[01:20:48.024 --> 01:20:48.845]  Great, great gals.
[01:20:49.245 --> 01:20:50.607]  The point is, I'm Mike Tumble.
[01:20:50.647 --> 01:20:51.388]  We're being censored.
[01:20:51.408 --> 01:20:52.369]  We're about to be shut down.
[01:20:52.689 --> 01:20:54.911]  You'll only find us at Infowars.com or BandNotVideo.
[01:20:55.172 --> 01:20:57.534]  Please share that link and then I'm not saying you're a bad guy.
[01:20:57.874 --> 01:20:58.996]  You're a regular listener.
[01:20:59.036 --> 01:21:02.780]  You didn't know two months ago they got dumped off there and they said in two months you'll be off.
[01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:03.821]  They had to give them two months notice.
[01:21:04.961 --> 01:21:09.384]  Alex, I truthfully did not know, and I don't sit there and watch them for hours.
[01:21:09.424 --> 01:21:10.886]  Listen, I'm not saying you're bad.
[01:21:11.046 --> 01:21:12.006]  That's what I'm getting at.
[01:21:13.007 --> 01:21:16.610]  I talk to people every day on the street that go, I used to love your show.
[01:21:16.730 --> 01:21:17.691]  Sorry you're off the air.
[01:21:18.772 --> 01:21:27.234]  And they're smart people, and I go, no, I'm on the air at Infowars.com and hundreds of stations, but they think I saw you here, now you're gone, now you're gone.
[01:21:27.554 --> 01:21:29.994]  People have to look for the truth.
[01:21:30.274 --> 01:21:34.975]  It's not going to get forced on you at the airports and hotels and train stations like CNN.
[01:21:35.195 --> 01:21:37.215]  It's going to be buried because they fear it.
[01:21:37.235 --> 01:21:37.875]  Does that make sense?
[01:21:38.956 --> 01:21:39.736]  No, it makes sense.
[01:21:39.816 --> 01:21:43.236]  And how I'm going to fight back, Alex, is first of all, I'm a founding member.
[01:21:43.276 --> 01:21:45.257]  I got my coin last week and I love it.
[01:21:45.337 --> 01:21:50.667]   And second of all, I'm going to go to Xfinity and dump AT&T, you know.
[01:21:50.667 --> 01:21:51.667]  And, uh...
[01:21:51.667 --> 01:21:54.147]  By the way, I love you, Chris, and I'm not putting you down.
[01:21:54.147 --> 01:21:55.147]  I'm the same way.
[01:21:55.147 --> 01:21:59.026]   I get busy, I don't pay attention, and then when something's censored, I tend to not go
[01:21:59.026 --> 01:22:01.346]  to it anymore because I just remember being there.
[01:22:01.346 --> 01:22:02.426]  So I'm the same way.
[01:22:02.426 --> 01:22:06.747]   I've done a bad job explaining to people, "Hey, we're being taken off all these things.
[01:22:06.747 --> 01:22:08.267]  You've got to come directly to us."
[01:22:08.267 --> 01:22:11.186]  OAN tried, but they put notices up.
[01:22:11.186 --> 01:22:16.546]   People don't watch the little notices at the bottom like they watch the host saying it.
[01:22:16.546 --> 01:22:19.306]   So OAN should have done more announcements, and I'm not putting them down.
[01:22:19.306 --> 01:22:23.467]   I should have, too, because everything is about letting people know.
[01:22:23.467 --> 01:22:26.787]   You're not going to get Alex Jones on Instagram or YouTube or Twitter.
[01:22:26.787 --> 01:22:33.427]   You're going to get Alex Jones at InfoWars.com and Band.Video and places like Rumble and
[01:22:33.467 --> 01:22:38.190]  And places like Getter, and places like Gab, and people gotta go there and that's where they gotta see it.
[01:22:38.571 --> 01:22:41.413]  And Senator Paul gets this, he goes, I'm not going on YouTube anymore.
[01:22:41.713 --> 01:22:43.614]  After they censored him saying natural immunity is better.
[01:22:43.874 --> 01:22:46.396]  He goes, I'm on Rumble now and his channels explode.
[01:22:46.696 --> 01:22:47.637]  Same thing with Bongino.
[01:22:47.857 --> 01:22:49.918]  We gotta get people onto our platforms.
[01:22:49.938 --> 01:22:50.398]  Well guess what?
[01:22:51.239 --> 01:22:53.721]  I got my own platform, Band.Video, thanks to you guys.
[01:22:53.941 --> 01:22:57.183]  And I'm saying that's where the truth is, so share Band.Video.
[01:22:58.186 --> 01:22:58.886]  It's real quick.
[01:22:58.926 --> 01:23:04.828]  I just want to say, to me, this is a huge, huge domino against freedom.
[01:23:05.108 --> 01:23:10.749]  OAN was my favorite station besides InfoWars, but on cable they were my favorite station.
[01:23:11.430 --> 01:23:16.871]  Fox News and Newsmax are next, and then InfoWars is next, and then the radio is next.
[01:23:17.051 --> 01:23:18.411]  Alex, it's happening.
[01:23:18.651 --> 01:23:19.812]  This is it, America.
[01:23:19.872 --> 01:23:20.512]  Wake up!
[01:23:20.993 --> 01:23:21.353]  I agree.
[01:23:21.393 --> 01:23:21.974]  God bless you.
[01:23:22.415 --> 01:23:24.257]  Yeah, let AT&T know you don't support them.
[01:23:24.698 --> 01:23:28.843]  Everybody that's got AT&T should say, I'm dubbing my AT&T unless you stop this.
[01:23:29.524 --> 01:23:30.946]  Because OAN was popular.
[01:23:31.086 --> 01:23:32.649]  OAN had more ratings than CNN.
[01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:33.129]  Way better.
[01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:34.671]  They tried to suppress those ratings.
[01:23:34.691 --> 01:23:35.232]  They got scared.
[01:23:35.573 --> 01:23:36.955]  I'll give you the inside baseball, okay?
[01:23:38.741 --> 01:23:42.905]  On cloud TV and a few other platforms we haven't been censored on, we are bigger than OAN.
[01:23:43.125 --> 01:23:44.727]  But OAN is the next biggest thing on there.
[01:23:45.407 --> 01:23:47.649]  And OAN was getting very, very, very popular.
[01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:49.631]  And that's why they did what they did.
[01:23:50.332 --> 01:23:50.812]  So the U.S.
[01:23:50.852 --> 01:23:54.115]  President censored, OAN censored, but I want to get it straight.
[01:23:54.435 --> 01:23:56.777]  InfoWars was taken off of the platforms first.
[01:23:57.378 --> 01:23:58.439]  Now they came for Trump.
[01:23:58.819 --> 01:24:00.180]  Now they're coming for OAN.
[01:24:00.541 --> 01:24:01.461]  Next they're coming for you.
[01:24:02.389 --> 01:24:04.510]  So the caller's like, well, next it'll be InfoWars.
[01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:12.636]  Well, InfoWars is still here, but you notice the caller had to come to InfoWars or a local AM or FM station who are precious.
[01:24:13.016 --> 01:24:13.916]  Everybody should support them.
[01:24:14.537 --> 01:24:17.839]  All right, let's take another caller here in the order they have been received.
[01:24:18.479 --> 01:24:19.860]  Vern in Texas.
[01:24:19.940 --> 01:24:20.501]  Thank you, Vern.
[01:24:22.122 --> 01:24:23.142]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:23.202 --> 01:24:24.423]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:24:25.084 --> 01:24:26.184]  I'm not transgender.
[01:24:26.585 --> 01:24:29.286]  My real name is Veronica, but short for Vern.
[01:24:31.218 --> 01:24:43.584]  Listen, I wanted to, um, I saw Dr. Artis on the several interviews he did, uh, on the 11th, Hugh Peters and Van Der Salle, uh, Brighton with Mike Adams.
[01:24:43.964 --> 01:24:45.825]  You really need to get him on your show.
[01:24:45.925 --> 01:24:47.366]  I know, he went on the Ellen Schreyer Show.
[01:24:47.406 --> 01:24:48.466]  I've heard Snake Venom.
[01:24:48.526 --> 01:24:49.967]  I think Snake Venom's in the water.
[01:24:51.092 --> 01:24:51.833]  Yes, yes.
[01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:57.797]  And, you know, the amount of evidence he presents to substantiate his claim is remarkable.
[01:24:58.417 --> 01:25:04.842]  And, you know, the information actually has been out there on the Internet since January 2020.
[01:25:04.962 --> 01:25:19.673]  He shows that one of the first articles speculated, that was written, speculated that the three possible sources for coronavirus were bats, pangolins and snakes.
[01:25:20.307 --> 01:25:23.873]  So, Dr. Artis has done an incredible connecting of the dots.
[01:25:25.095 --> 01:25:33.194]   You know, you have had Ed Dowd on your show, the stock market analyst, and he, I was really
[01:25:33.194 --> 01:25:38.795]   impressed in his interview with Christy Lee because he said he prayed to God and, you
[01:25:38.795 --> 01:25:40.555]  know, asked how he could be of service.
[01:25:40.555 --> 01:25:48.195]   And then shortly thereafter, Dr. Malone came to Maui, and through a series of coincidences,
[01:25:48.195 --> 01:25:51.595]  he was able to meet Malone and Steve Kirsch.
[01:25:51.595 --> 01:25:56.114]   And from then on, you know, the information that Ed Dowd had just took off.
[01:25:56.114 --> 01:26:05.634]   So by the same token, Dr. Artis, you know, a series of coincidences, remarkable coincidences,
[01:26:05.634 --> 01:26:10.115]  truly inspired by God, like led him to this supposition.
[01:26:10.115 --> 01:26:16.435]   And then after that, he was able to kind of methodically prove that coronavirus is actually
[01:26:17.136 --> 01:26:23.376]   snake venom, specifically the krait snakes and the cobra snakes.
[01:26:23.376 --> 01:26:24.376]  And what's interesting is...
[01:26:24.376 --> 01:26:25.376]  Ma'am, let me ask you a question.
[01:26:25.376 --> 01:26:28.055]   And I'm not poo-pooing this, but I've interviewed the top scientists.
[01:26:28.055 --> 01:26:31.436]  We've looked at the viral scans at major universities.
[01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:32.436]  They made a virus.
[01:26:32.436 --> 01:26:34.416]  Viruses are able to replicate the body.
[01:26:34.416 --> 01:26:38.855]   So do you know how much snake venom you'd have to put in a water supply to have these
[01:26:38.855 --> 01:26:42.815]   type of blood clotting effects and things that a snake bite would do?
[01:26:42.844 --> 01:26:49.228]  You know, a snake bites you, it pumps in, you know, say, a tenth of an ounce of venom into your half an ounce.
[01:26:50.598 --> 01:26:53.279]  And then it makes you have blood clots and your leg rots off and you die.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.580]  I'm not poo-pooing this one.
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:56.481]  We'll get artists on it.
[01:26:56.541 --> 01:26:57.881]  I know it's the big, big thing right now.
[01:26:58.462 --> 01:27:06.385]  But to say that snake venom is being dumped in the water supply, it's diluted and it breaks down electrochemically very quickly.
[01:27:06.946 --> 01:27:11.508]  What you want is a virus because it replicates in the body so it spreads quickly.
[01:27:12.248 --> 01:27:21.734]  To say that poison's in water, and then it's contagious to other people, and I've experienced the contagion of COVID, is very, very interesting.
[01:27:21.794 --> 01:27:24.816]  So, I'm gonna look into this and I appreciate your call.
[01:27:25.397 --> 01:27:27.038]  I mean, I started seeing this a few days ago.
[01:27:27.058 --> 01:27:30.720]  I looked at it, I'm like, they're dumping snake venom in the water, huh?
[01:27:32.001 --> 01:27:33.322]  How many snakes they got to do that?
[01:27:37.045 --> 01:27:37.465]  Stay with us.
[01:27:40.543 --> 01:27:53.088]  Please remember, the only way we stay on air is your support, and I am extremely excited that a product that I thought I might have to discontinue because of supply chain breakdowns, because we get it from France through an American distributor, is available again.
[01:27:53.108 --> 01:28:00.011]  Because I put the money in 11 months ago to get this, almost demanded it back a few months ago, and they said, no, France is opening back up, and the farm that makes it, you're going to get it.
[01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:02.372]  And they documented it over the last 100 years.
[01:28:02.591 --> 01:28:06.152]   It does better in a lot of different studies and tests than even over-the-counter antihistamines
[01:28:06.152 --> 01:28:07.152]  and things.
[01:28:07.152 --> 01:28:08.152]  It's all natural.
[01:28:08.152 --> 01:28:11.331]   It is the shells of a special type of quail, had a special diet where they learned it had
[01:28:11.331 --> 01:28:13.671]  a major anti-allergy effect.
[01:28:13.671 --> 01:28:15.510]  Helps support healthy sinus function.
[01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:16.951]  Helps enhance respiratory function.
[01:28:16.951 --> 01:28:19.192]  Alambla promotes clear airway passages.
[01:28:18.989 --> 01:28:21.609]   and normal breathing promotes respiratory health and normal breathing
[01:28:21.609 --> 01:28:25.769]   supports eye comfort and sinus health. Quail egg extract decades ago researchers
[01:28:25.769 --> 01:28:29.168]   in France discovered the ability for certain quail eggs to alleviate season
[01:28:29.168 --> 01:28:33.050]   related symptoms when eaten and it is powerful and despite the fact it'll sell
[01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:37.229]   out before I ever get more of it in I'm offering it out of the gates 40% off at
[01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:48.004]   infowarestore.com We're also going to end the sale at the end of the week for Bazzo Beets Heat Concentrate that's documented so good for your heart, creates nitrous oxide in the blood, wonderful for your cardiovascular system, fights blood clots, everything.

[01:28:56.247 --> 01:28:58.107]  It's just like the iodine, but different.
[01:28:58.127 --> 01:28:58.928]  You need the two together.
[01:28:59.048 --> 01:29:00.068]  It is back in stock.
[01:29:00.208 --> 01:29:00.848]  It is 40% off.
[01:29:00.988 --> 01:29:04.688]   That sale is going to be to be ending on Monday or so because we've already sold out
[01:29:04.688 --> 01:29:05.448]  a lot of the stock.
[01:29:05.448 --> 01:29:08.528]   And we're trying to, again, reach our underages with things we don't have in
[01:29:08.528 --> 01:29:11.889]  stock anymore that people buy by selling out of the t-shirts.
[01:29:11.889 --> 01:29:14.809]  And we had 63,000 t-shirts over the last few years.
[01:29:14.809 --> 01:29:17.528]  I ordered and bid and never promoted or sold.
[01:29:17.528 --> 01:29:19.849]  We had a lot of, some t-shirts sold well, some didn't.
[01:29:19.849 --> 01:29:21.368]  We had a lot of them just building up.
[01:29:21.368 --> 01:29:22.927]  Some of the best sellers are there as well.
[01:29:22.927 --> 01:29:24.328]  We're never going to reprint any of these.
[01:29:24.364 --> 01:29:25.104]  How are you today, sir?
[01:29:25.144 --> 01:29:25.725]  I'm good, brother.
[01:29:25.565 --> 01:29:30.755]   this and I appreciate everybody coming through. We've already sold out 20% of the stock. So in another week or
[01:29:30.755 --> 01:29:37.375]   two we should sell out of all these t-shirts. Your last chance to get them ever. We're selling them at cost at infowarestore.com.
[01:29:37.375 --> 01:29:43.424]   Thank you for your support. Stay with us. Alright, let's go right back to your calls ahead of Ali Alexander joining us
[01:29:43.424 --> 01:29:49.365]   in the studio with big breaking news. Mark in Montana. Mark, welcome and thank you for calling today. Alex Jones, my
[01:29:49.365 --> 01:29:55.565]   brother in Christ. How are you today, sir? I'm good, brother. Thank you for calling. Absolutely.
[01:29:53.972 --> 01:30:06.962]  The Lord put on my heart to come call and give you an exhortation and just let you know, besides the tip of the spear, you're a crusader, a modern-day crusader for these times before the return of our Lord and Savior.
[01:30:08.043 --> 01:30:23.515]   As you know, and you have spoke, we're in the days of Noah, or the days of Lot, and many are just not awake, but you as a crusader are leading those As a type like Noah, as they came up to the sea, they looked behind them, Pharaoh's army was there.
[01:30:23.836 --> 01:30:25.277]  Today that's our evil.
[01:30:25.817 --> 01:30:28.119]  And in front is a sea that is impenetrable.
[01:30:28.659 --> 01:30:32.202]  He, as the word says, knew that God will make a way.
[01:30:32.682 --> 01:30:34.683]  And he parted the sea, and he made it across.
[01:30:34.723 --> 01:30:37.986]  You're leading people in that way, into the light, into the truth.
[01:30:38.384 --> 01:30:41.463]  and that's going to lead to great and mighty things.
[01:30:41.463 --> 01:30:46.182]   So I want to encourage you with what you're doing, and to continue to do what you're doing.
[01:30:46.182 --> 01:30:51.222]   You remind me of a modern-day Stephen, and that man stood before the Sanhedrin
[01:30:51.222 --> 01:30:59.943]   and gave them literally a synopsis of the Torah and what God had planned for the Jewish people.
[01:30:59.943 --> 01:31:02.543]  And at the end, they took him out and they stoned him.
[01:31:02.182 --> 01:31:04.925]  But something very significant happened during the time of Stephen.
[01:31:04.965 --> 01:31:08.589]  A man full of faith like you, and the Holy Spirit like you.
[01:31:08.609 --> 01:31:17.439]  And in that, as they were getting ready to stone him, he looked up and he saw Jesus Christ, who is seated at the right hand of the Father at this time.
[01:31:17.899 --> 01:31:19.659]  Standing at the right hand of the Father.
[01:31:19.759 --> 01:31:24.320]  One of the only times in the Bible where it says he was seen standing at the right hand of the Father.
[01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:28.581]  Because Stephen and his testimony allowed Jesus to arise.
[01:31:28.601 --> 01:31:31.782]  Psalms 58, excuse me, 68 says this.
[01:31:31.962 --> 01:31:33.962]  Alex, I want you to hear this.
[01:31:33.962 --> 01:31:40.362]   Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered, let those also who hate him flee before him,
[01:31:40.362 --> 01:31:45.162]   as smoke is driven away, so drive them away as wax melt before the fire.
[01:31:45.162 --> 01:31:50.362]  Also let the wicked perish in the presence of God.
[01:31:50.530 --> 01:31:52.311]  You are like a Stephen.
[01:31:52.331 --> 01:31:58.716]  You are standing in truth, and as Stephen was stoned, he fell asleep because God was with him.
[01:31:58.876 --> 01:31:59.796]  God is with you.
[01:32:00.077 --> 01:32:08.042]  He will make a way where you need finances, where you're going to get what you need to do the work that He has called you to do.
[01:32:08.122 --> 01:32:10.724]  You said, like Isaiah, here I am, Lord, send me.
[01:32:10.965 --> 01:32:14.987]  He doesn't send anybody without giving them what they need to go and do His work.
[01:32:15.868 --> 01:32:17.428]  So stand strong, my brother.
[01:32:17.768 --> 01:32:18.309]  Believe.
[01:32:18.749 --> 01:32:20.649]  My wife and I are supporters.
[01:32:20.789 --> 01:32:22.069]  We love everything you're doing.
[01:32:22.129 --> 01:32:23.570]  Mark, we thank you and thank you.
[01:32:23.610 --> 01:32:24.050]  God bless you.
[01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:27.631]  I don't want to compare myself to somebody that great, but we're all standing together with God.
[01:32:27.971 --> 01:32:28.991]  And you're Stephen as well.
[01:32:29.031 --> 01:32:29.631]  God bless you.
[01:32:30.111 --> 01:32:31.371]  I want to play a little clip.
[01:32:31.411 --> 01:32:37.793]  They've got the video now of Frank James, the reported shooter, entering the subway in the subway worker.
[01:32:38.212 --> 01:32:43.492]   outfit before he did what he did. And of course you can wear a mask to get away with it. Just total insanity.
[01:32:43.492 --> 01:32:50.072]   And again, this is just what our country in the world is turning into. But thank you all for your support.
[01:32:50.072 --> 01:32:54.551]   Look how in New York, they've had their shots, but they're still wearing their mask. And now they're putting in AI
[01:32:54.551 --> 01:32:56.672]  robots in public schools.
[01:32:56.672 --> 01:33:03.672]   And at Love Field, first airport I ever flew out of on a trip to Houston, in the middle of Dallas, Texas, has
[01:33:04.132 --> 01:33:08.692]   seven foot robots that bark orders and yell at you if you're not wearing your mask.
[01:33:08.746 --> 01:33:13.627]  I mean, this is just an AI robot satanic takeover.
[01:33:13.667 --> 01:33:14.607]  We know where it's going.
[01:33:16.567 --> 01:33:19.008]  And we've got to say no and not go along with it.
[01:33:19.028 --> 01:33:24.529]  Here's a few clips of Frank James spouting his racist garbage, because the corporate media doesn't want you to see this.
[01:33:24.849 --> 01:33:25.649]  They don't want you to know this.
[01:33:27.045 --> 01:33:34.691]  Remember when I went there, I was a nice person, I wanted to help people, I wanted to do... When I left, I thought, nah, I'm... I wanted to kill everything in sight.
[01:33:35.952 --> 01:33:40.936]  I was planning to kill everything I saw, based on how I was treated by these bitch**.
[01:33:41.776 --> 01:33:53.225]  And a dirty fucking, and especially a fucking stinking bitch**, about to be dead black bitch**, about to be dead, about to be exterminated, about to be taken to the fucking slaughter, like the fucking farm animal you are.
[01:33:53.245 --> 01:33:54.306]  I'm talking about in my next video.
[01:33:54.486 --> 01:33:55.147]  That's all you are.
[01:33:57.273 --> 01:33:57.853]  A foreman!
[01:33:58.994 --> 01:34:04.816]  I had no idea with that African name that she would be married to a white man.
[01:34:05.037 --> 01:34:07.017]  One of my subscribers brought that to my attention.
[01:34:09.358 --> 01:34:09.679]  Yeah.
[01:34:11.119 --> 01:34:17.642]  Our black sister Supreme Court Justice, power to the people, is married to a fucking white man!
[01:34:17.842 --> 01:34:18.423]  She's fucked!
[01:34:19.023 --> 01:34:19.883]  I don't believe it!
[01:34:20.423 --> 01:34:21.004]  Oh God!
[01:34:22.084 --> 01:34:22.644]  Wait a minute!
[01:34:22.664 --> 01:34:25.906]  This is the motherfucker right there!
[01:34:29.206 --> 01:34:37.532]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[01:34:37.572 --> 01:34:38.573]  Dude, he's such a kind man.
[01:34:38.593 --> 01:34:39.754]  He has been so cancelled.
[01:34:40.294 --> 01:34:43.736]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[01:34:44.036 --> 01:34:47.759]  How much heat have you gotten for being friends with him and having him on the show?
[01:34:47.879 --> 01:34:49.300]  A lot, but I don't pay attention.
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:49.800]  Okay.
[01:34:50.401 --> 01:34:50.681]  Yeah.
[01:34:51.361 --> 01:34:53.243]  I just, I can justify it.
[01:34:54.023 --> 01:34:57.646]  I'll tell you that fucking guy is right about a lot of shit.
[01:34:57.706 --> 01:35:00.789]  He's a wild entertainer and a brilliant man.
[01:35:01.009 --> 01:35:01.690]  Isn't he fantastic?
[01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:02.531]  And no one is perfect.
[01:35:02.831 --> 01:35:05.013]  I've known Alex for like more than 20 years.
[01:35:05.273 --> 01:35:06.054]  I've hung out with that guy.
[01:35:06.074 --> 01:35:07.735]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[01:35:09.336 --> 01:35:11.138]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[01:35:11.298 --> 01:35:14.701]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:35:14.841 --> 01:35:16.062]  Shout out to Alex Jones.
[01:35:16.082 --> 01:35:16.563]  We love you.
[01:35:17.043 --> 01:35:19.005]  Alex Jones is a journalist and member of the media.
[01:35:19.325 --> 01:35:19.786]  End of story.
[01:35:19.806 --> 01:35:25.952]  Recently, many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content from broadcaster Alex Jones.
[01:35:26.012 --> 01:35:36.223]  There's a reason why the mainstream media calls a guy like him a bomb thrower or a conspiracy theorist, because they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out.
[01:35:36.423 --> 01:35:46.719]  Why are the most powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent radio show host in Texas that they're willing to lose business in order to make him shut up?
[01:35:46.940 --> 01:35:48.101]  He runs a media organization.
[01:35:48.482 --> 01:35:51.066]  And so when the January 6th Committee subpoenas him...
[01:35:51.767 --> 01:35:54.729]  They're basically violating our First Amendment protections.
[01:35:55.050 --> 01:36:05.037]  The Department of Justice says not only is it investigating what happened inside the Capitol, but the conspirators and instigators who may have started this whole thing.
[01:36:05.257 --> 01:36:09.921]  Now the committees decided to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the right, Alex Jones.
[01:36:10.461 --> 01:36:11.102]  Yes, journalist.
[01:36:11.342 --> 01:36:14.024]  The House Committee investigating the deadly assault on the U.S.
[01:36:14.064 --> 01:36:19.308]  Capitol is subpoenaing Trump allies Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:36:19.348 --> 01:36:22.951]  The committee says he helped organize the rally ahead of the riots.
[01:36:23.051 --> 01:36:27.595]  Alex Jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on January 6th.
[01:36:27.815 --> 01:36:33.415]   Alex Jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on January 6th.
[01:36:33.415 --> 01:36:35.415]  Let's start marching to the Capitol!
[01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:37.414]  [crowd cheering]
[01:36:37.414 --> 01:36:44.534]   Notice, like Don Jr. said, we're not burning buildings down or shooting cops, we're building America!
[01:36:44.389 --> 01:36:49.429]  We're here to take our rightful country back peacefully.
[01:36:49.429 --> 01:36:52.628]   We're not running interference for Alex Jones, and we're not guessing about it.
[01:36:52.628 --> 01:36:53.628]  We happen to know this for a fact.
[01:36:53.628 --> 01:36:54.628]  We need to not have a confrontation with the police.
[01:36:54.628 --> 01:37:02.309]  We're going to make that the story.
[01:37:02.309 --> 01:37:08.748]   Alex Jones is a journalist the same as Brian Stelter and Jake Tapper and Don Lemon are.
[01:37:08.723 --> 01:37:09.163]  Absolutely.
[01:37:09.183 --> 01:37:10.685]  I was about to say the same thing.
[01:37:10.805 --> 01:37:12.887]  Some people are going to be like, don't insult Alex that way.
[01:37:12.947 --> 01:37:15.109]  Well, yeah, Alex Jones never lied us into a war.
[01:37:15.570 --> 01:37:16.291]  Right, right, right.
[01:37:16.311 --> 01:37:16.671]  True.
[01:37:17.051 --> 01:37:20.054]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:37:20.815 --> 01:37:25.778]  And if Jones said that with Tony Fauci, he would ask him real questions, just as journalists are supposed to do.
[01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:27.400]  He wouldn't just slobber all over him.
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.541]  Epstein, he was way ahead with that.
[01:37:29.581 --> 01:37:32.023]  He told me about Epstein a decade ago.
[01:37:32.423 --> 01:37:34.324]  Alex detailed all of that.
[01:37:34.985 --> 01:37:37.026]  Alex Jones, Info Wars.
[01:37:37.426 --> 01:37:42.950]  The media has tarnished him with all sorts of name-calling, conspiracy theorists, bomb-thrower.
[01:37:43.410 --> 01:37:48.253]  The one thing that I know about this gentleman, Alex Jones, is that he loves this country.
[01:37:48.854 --> 01:37:50.275]  He is as smart as a whip.
[01:37:50.935 --> 01:37:55.774]  He absolutely believes in what he believes in.
[01:37:55.774 --> 01:37:58.335]  And he also does his research and his homework.
[01:37:58.335 --> 01:38:03.454]   Cooley compare Hotez's views on COVID to say Alex Jones's views on COVID
[01:38:03.454 --> 01:38:05.694]  and ask yourself, who's saner?
[01:38:05.694 --> 01:38:06.974]  It's not even close.
[01:38:06.974 --> 01:38:10.134]  He's incredibly detailed in his research.
[01:38:10.134 --> 01:38:11.294]  He loves this country.
[01:38:11.294 --> 01:38:16.855]   He is a patriot and he's somebody who we better listen to or others in this country better listen to.
[01:38:16.855 --> 01:38:20.215]   Is it a stretch to say that Tucker Carlson is the new Alex Jones?
[01:38:20.215 --> 01:38:22.215]  There are no vaccine passports!
[01:38:21.777 --> 01:38:22.398]  That's insane!
[01:38:22.418 --> 01:38:23.820]  That's Alex Jones stuff!
[01:38:24.521 --> 01:38:29.108]  And by the way, just so you know, as proof, if you want to get a job, you'll need your vaccine papers.
[01:38:34.105 --> 01:38:38.330]  All right, he was on with us Monday, and I asked him, please come down from Dallas, and he did it.
[01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:39.672]  Ali Alexander is here.
[01:38:40.373 --> 01:38:45.399]  Ali Alexander is the editorial consultant for Culture.com, political consultant, philosopher, and activist.
[01:38:46.019 --> 01:38:52.727]  He's been consulting for Republican campaigns and conservative issues for more than 13 years, and he's been doing it at the national level.
[01:38:53.388 --> 01:38:57.071]  But now he's much more interested in philosophy and building a better society.
[01:38:57.551 --> 01:39:04.876]  GiveSendGo.com forward slash Ali Alexander, Gab, PrettySocial at Ali, Telegram, and more.
[01:39:04.956 --> 01:39:06.277]  He joins us now.
[01:39:07.257 --> 01:39:14.362]  Ali, I've got a thousand points to make and things to go over here with you, but you've been the one guy who didn't cooperate.
[01:39:14.702 --> 01:39:23.095]   You were willing to go in and say we're innocent in front of the committee, and now with the feds, "Yeah, we've done nothing wrong. You were there, I was
[01:39:23.095 --> 01:39:27.094]   there. I'm just so worried about perjury traps that I've not wanted to walk in the lines then, but
[01:39:27.094 --> 01:39:27.875]  you've done it."
[01:39:27.875 --> 01:39:33.954]   Such an incredible time. Now, Whitmer and then the whole plot being confirmed by a jury to be staged.
[01:39:33.954 --> 01:39:38.354]   You know, the jury saying, "Yeah, clearly the FBI ordered them to do this and threatened them to do
[01:39:38.354 --> 01:39:43.234]   this." Seems like the wheels are really coming off, but in a way that scares me more. Because
[01:39:43.234 --> 01:39:46.994]  Biden's like, "We need to ban guns and prostitutes."
[01:39:47.222 --> 01:39:48.604]  He doesn't even know what planet he's on.
[01:39:48.984 --> 01:39:52.048]  I don't politically go, oh look, our enemies are weak and dumb.
[01:39:52.068 --> 01:39:52.869]  They're running the country.
[01:39:53.210 --> 01:39:55.032]  I wish they'd wake up and stop being so crazy.
[01:39:55.633 --> 01:39:57.455]  So you said it on Monday.
[01:39:57.495 --> 01:39:59.097]  You really fear for the future of the country.
[01:39:59.117 --> 01:39:59.438]  So do I.
[01:39:59.778 --> 01:40:07.163]  Yeah, you know, a couple years ago I came on your air and we talked about what I believed was what I called inversion, you know.
[01:40:07.844 --> 01:40:11.006]  And it looks like that's what they're doing to our country.
[01:40:11.046 --> 01:40:17.131]  And what they attempt to do is not pin just two sides against each other, but to invert those two sides against each other.
[01:40:17.191 --> 01:40:21.434]  So you have the corporatists and the progressives, they're currently imploding the left.
[01:40:21.894 --> 01:40:24.975]  And over here on the right, you have the corporatists and the populists.
[01:40:25.435 --> 01:40:26.675]  And we're over here imploding.
[01:40:26.715 --> 01:40:35.378]  And so I don't think it's a coincidence that the media is acknowledging the Hunter Biden laptop while the J6 sham is going on.
[01:40:35.518 --> 01:40:35.858]  Why?
[01:40:36.318 --> 01:40:43.580]  They need to give something to everybody to radicalize everyone so that they have more situations like what just happened in New York City.
[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:48.422]  I mean, it's kind of fascinating that people are still wearing their masks, still going on the subway.
[01:40:48.802 --> 01:40:51.402]  after what happened yesterday, but that's what they want.
[01:40:51.402 --> 01:40:54.882]  They want to just set the whole damn country on fire.
[01:40:54.882 --> 01:40:55.882]  That's it.
[01:40:55.882 --> 01:41:00.602]   It's a cause for an angry world and out of the collapse, we will build back better.
[01:41:00.602 --> 01:41:01.602]  That's what it is.
[01:41:01.602 --> 01:41:03.481]  These people believe order out of chaos.
[01:41:03.481 --> 01:41:05.641]  They believe they must break things down.
[01:41:05.641 --> 01:41:07.122]  You know, these people are alchemists.
[01:41:07.122 --> 01:41:09.001]  They fancy themselves as alchemists.
[01:41:09.001 --> 01:41:12.802]   What they want to do is they want to break things down and then rebuild them up.
[01:41:12.806 --> 01:41:14.868]  It's part of the transgender movement as well.
[01:41:14.908 --> 01:41:15.889]  It's not even a movement.
[01:41:16.589 --> 01:41:28.379]  The transgender programming, you know, Baphomet, I mean, you know, read that little Latin phrase underneath Baphomet, you know, Solve et Coagula, you know, so these people are experts at breaking everything.
[01:41:28.959 --> 01:41:30.420]  Yeah, yeah, to recongeal.
[01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:32.481]  And so, you know, this is what they want.
[01:41:32.521 --> 01:41:41.905]  They want us to live in this global one state, one religion, one thought, and we're all economic units building their pyramid, their life extension machines.
[01:41:42.486 --> 01:41:44.607]  And, you know, J6 is a part of that.
[01:41:44.727 --> 01:41:45.947]  Michigan is a part of that.
[01:41:46.188 --> 01:41:48.209]  Hunter Biden's laptop is a part of that.
[01:41:48.429 --> 01:41:53.311]  There's going to be things you agree with and things you disagree with, but they'll be able to feed something to everybody.
[01:41:53.371 --> 01:41:55.132]  Regardless, they're turning the temperature up.
[01:41:55.192 --> 01:41:56.893]  That's why we need to dial the temperature down.
[01:41:57.333 --> 01:41:58.354]  And I think we have.
[01:41:58.474 --> 01:42:00.195]  And I think that that's why they're so frustrated.
[01:42:00.335 --> 01:42:09.681]  Alex, you know, if there's two people who can relate to each other and what we're going through both in the public eye and then we've been through some wars, we've been through some wars.
[01:42:10.181 --> 01:42:14.413]   And, you know, What I think is that they mean for us to go crazy.
[01:42:14.453 --> 01:42:18.736]  They mean for other people like, you know, Matthew Perna, a J6 defendant.
[01:42:19.476 --> 01:42:23.219]  The justice system played with him until he committed suicide.
[01:42:23.679 --> 01:42:24.900]  And they want the same for me.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.441]  They want the same for you.
[01:42:26.861 --> 01:42:28.943]  You know, Donald Trump's never going to come close to it.
[01:42:28.983 --> 01:42:30.964]  But, you know, they just put us through this iron.
[01:42:31.324 --> 01:42:38.087]  This investigation goes nowhere and they make you caricatures while they de-platform you so that people run up to you.
[01:42:38.387 --> 01:42:39.867]  You know, we're walking in public.
[01:42:39.907 --> 01:42:42.788]  I've been ran up to and people, you know, attack me at the airport.
[01:42:43.108 --> 01:42:45.369]  You know, I was on an airplane and this guy takes a picture of me.
[01:42:45.389 --> 01:42:48.090]  Oh, he's on this flight and he's landing at this time.
[01:42:48.450 --> 01:42:52.132]  You know, it's a bizarre time to be alive, but they can't break us here.
[01:42:52.172 --> 01:42:55.033]  Oh, they're all like little secret agents like us existing criminals.
[01:42:55.273 --> 01:42:55.553]  Yeah.
[01:42:55.773 --> 01:42:56.713]  Oh, look, they're talking.
[01:42:57.133 --> 01:42:57.514]  Oh, look.
[01:42:58.914 --> 01:43:01.236]  Yeah, you know, it's absolutely fascinating to me.
[01:43:01.316 --> 01:43:03.277]  I have my Periscope videos.
[01:43:03.297 --> 01:43:05.599]  I was one of the most popular people on the Periscope service.
[01:43:06.159 --> 01:43:10.522]  And they have all these videos, and now the press reports it as now-deleted videos.
[01:43:11.263 --> 01:43:12.724]  Twitter deleted my videos!
[01:43:12.804 --> 01:43:13.925]  Yeah, like, I saw it.
[01:43:14.065 --> 01:43:17.087]  Ali Alexander, National News, hiding videos.
[01:43:17.407 --> 01:43:19.149]  You were bitching when they took your channel!
[01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:22.331]  Yeah, yeah, so... When I got sued, I've been sanctioned, like...
[01:43:22.651 --> 01:43:23.733]  You got rid of your YouTube.
[01:43:23.793 --> 01:43:24.454]  You're sanctioned.
[01:43:24.514 --> 01:43:25.455]  No, they did that.
[01:43:25.495 --> 01:43:26.918]  Yeah, they took it away.
[01:43:27.238 --> 01:43:30.523]  And what's amazing about this, and folks really need to take a step back.
[01:43:31.607 --> 01:43:40.851]  Is Alex Jones accused of anything that he hasn't voluntarily or publicly said that in context makes sense?
[01:43:41.171 --> 01:43:41.991]  The answer is no.
[01:43:42.412 --> 01:43:52.416]  Is there anything that Ali Alexander has not volunteered to the public that, you know, the New York Times then writes as a headline, like, Ali said that he was going to coordinate with the Proud Boys.
[01:43:52.556 --> 01:43:58.098]  When the Proud Boys got kicked from their hotel, I made a call and said, this is wrong, this is civil rights abuse.
[01:43:58.418 --> 01:43:59.559]  That was the extent of that.
[01:44:00.279 --> 01:44:08.922]  But that didn't stop the J6 committee from committing tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of dollars in investigating me over the comments.
[01:44:08.942 --> 01:44:09.642]  But let's be clear.
[01:44:10.703 --> 01:44:12.383]  It's bigger than Ali Alexander and Alex Jones.
[01:44:12.924 --> 01:44:15.305]  They're coming after America on Jan 6th.
[01:44:15.345 --> 01:44:15.685]  All of us.
[01:44:15.885 --> 01:44:17.325]  So you're all sick of hearing about it, folks.
[01:44:17.345 --> 01:44:19.026]  They're getting ready to stage major stuff in my view.
[01:44:19.506 --> 01:44:24.608]  Ali Alexander is my guest in the studio, and he's a really smart political analyst and pro-American pundit.
[01:44:25.389 --> 01:44:29.991]  Ali, I want to be clear with people that our listeners know we didn't stage January 6th.
[01:44:30.011 --> 01:44:34.373]  They know it was provocateur by the feds and some idiot groups that got played into it.
[01:44:36.121 --> 01:44:51.333]  But they're betting the whole election, they now admit in 209 days, on this, and they're stating false flags are coming by Trump supporters that challenge elections, and they're actively investigating you and I as masterminds, even though we know we're totally innocent.
[01:44:51.673 --> 01:44:53.855]  And so this is a big deal for everybody.
[01:44:54.215 --> 01:44:55.556]  This is the Democrat play.
[01:44:56.196 --> 01:44:59.139]  You have these headlines here, Democrats death march.
[01:45:00.356 --> 01:45:14.999]  We talk about how unpopular they are and how all the polls show the biggest political realignment ever, but they're betting everything on January 6th, which without a false flag or some new crime committed by quote Jan Sixers is going to fall flat on its face.
[01:45:15.059 --> 01:45:19.480]  So obviously you've got to be a moron not to know they're planning something big.
[01:45:19.741 --> 01:45:21.441]  So that's why this is so important.
[01:45:22.001 --> 01:45:23.282]  Yes, we care about ourselves.
[01:45:23.322 --> 01:45:24.202]  Yes, we're under attack.
[01:45:24.222 --> 01:45:25.542]  But this is a lot bigger.
[01:45:25.582 --> 01:45:27.003]  Explain that to people.
[01:45:27.143 --> 01:45:28.063]  They need puppets.
[01:45:28.663 --> 01:45:31.104]  These people are master storytellers.
[01:45:31.584 --> 01:45:33.325]  And what they need is to fill in the banks.
[01:45:33.385 --> 01:45:35.806]  So they've already said, here's the crime.
[01:45:36.266 --> 01:45:37.326]  Here's how it happened.
[01:45:37.747 --> 01:45:38.927]  There's no evidence for it.
[01:45:39.127 --> 01:45:41.549]  And then they outlaw American opposition in questioning elections.
[01:45:41.569 --> 01:45:41.949]  That's the key.
[01:45:41.969 --> 01:45:43.110]  People are like, okay, great.
[01:45:44.612 --> 01:45:46.613]  This is labeling America as terrorist.
[01:45:47.234 --> 01:45:53.679]  Like you see the school boards saying, questioning transgenderism, or your kid getting raped, or critical race theories, terror.
[01:45:53.939 --> 01:45:56.001]  This is really branding you as a terrorist.
[01:45:56.061 --> 01:45:57.802]  If they get away with us, it's you.
[01:45:58.063 --> 01:46:00.004]  Yeah, it's absolutely you, Nex.
[01:46:00.064 --> 01:46:01.165]  It's actually you now.
[01:46:01.545 --> 01:46:03.627]  You know, let me go ahead and break some news.
[01:46:03.647 --> 01:46:14.994]   I've not told any reporter this, and only my lawyers and I are aware of this, but The January 6th committee is going to try to outlaw Bitcoin.
[01:46:16.134 --> 01:46:20.756]  This sounds kind of crazy, but this is where this is leading.
[01:46:21.377 --> 01:46:22.817]  And I knew this in December.
[01:46:23.618 --> 01:46:25.238]  But I want to break it here on InfoWars.
[01:46:25.698 --> 01:46:28.860]  What you're going to see the committee do, they're going to say, well, Donald Trump did this.
[01:46:29.460 --> 01:46:30.340]  Roger Stone did this.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:31.161]  Rudy did this.
[01:46:31.241 --> 01:46:31.941]  Ali did this.
[01:46:32.361 --> 01:46:33.061]  Alex did this.
[01:46:33.461 --> 01:46:34.682]  Here's criminal referrals.
[01:46:34.902 --> 01:46:40.664]  Here's things we're not going to criminally refer, but we'd really like, wink wink, nudge nudge, the Justice Department to move on.
[01:46:41.184 --> 01:46:47.066]  And here are 10 policy recommendations to keep the right wing from ever organizing again.
[01:46:47.386 --> 01:46:50.687]  You're going to see recommendations in there that try to outlaw Telegram.
[01:46:50.947 --> 01:46:51.207]  Very astute.
[01:46:51.027 --> 01:46:55.945]   try to outlaw or censor Bitcoin, increase the regulatory environment for Bitcoin so
[01:46:55.945 --> 01:46:59.667]   that it's harder for more Americans to get in while the rest of the world competes with
[01:46:59.667 --> 01:47:02.426]  us on this sovereign currency.
[01:47:02.426 --> 01:47:03.426]  I mean it's absolutely insane.
[01:47:03.426 --> 01:47:04.426]  Very astute.
[01:47:04.426 --> 01:47:07.706]  This is about outlawing protests and all of its funding.
[01:47:07.706 --> 01:47:08.706]  Yeah.
[01:47:08.706 --> 01:47:09.865]  I mean, and think about this.
[01:47:09.894 --> 01:47:15.796]  I mean, you were a pioneer when I was, you know, still eating the kind of the state narrative around 9-11.
[01:47:16.276 --> 01:47:18.237]  So the 9-11 Commission did the same thing.
[01:47:18.277 --> 01:47:21.998]  It's like, oh, here are liberties you need to take away from everyday Americans.
[01:47:22.238 --> 01:47:25.839]  And by the way, we need to go and track the library books that they're renting at the library.
[01:47:25.859 --> 01:47:32.062]  And people need to take off shoes at the airport because one person had a failed attempt at a shoe bomb, allegedly.
[01:47:32.162 --> 01:47:35.723]  So, you know, what we're about to see is this isn't about me and you, Alex.
[01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:46.156]  They will use us in puppets in their fake story to make policy recommendations that rhino Republicans and corporatist Democrats will pass by large majorities.
[01:47:47.915 --> 01:47:48.816]  Jet, please continue.
[01:47:48.876 --> 01:47:50.217]  I mean, and everybody's screwed!
[01:47:50.677 --> 01:47:52.438]  Unless we continue to speak up.
[01:47:52.458 --> 01:47:54.840]  What these people love is they love surprising people.
[01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:56.721]  That's why they must de-platform us.
[01:47:57.101 --> 01:48:11.191]  So the more that we talk about this stuff, the more that the American citizen and our neighbors can see that we have scoops on InfoWars and we have scoops on Revolver News and all these independent media outlets, the more people will stop trusting CNN.
[01:48:11.431 --> 01:48:15.934]  I think you have an article there that shows that CNN spent how much money to get 10,000 viewers?
[01:48:15.954 --> 01:48:17.195]  300 plus million.
[01:48:17.095 --> 01:48:19.494]  That's state media. I mean that's just subsidized.
[01:48:19.494 --> 01:48:22.934]  300 million, 10,000 viewers a week. I mean that's a joke.
[01:48:22.934 --> 01:48:26.374]   Yeah, give me a fraction of that money and we'll go super viral.
[01:48:26.374 --> 01:48:28.854]  But no, it's really unfortunate like what they're doing.
[01:48:28.854 --> 01:48:33.735]   And I'll say this, you know, I'm really happy to be in studio today and I'm happy to be with you.
[01:48:33.735 --> 01:48:37.255]   One, because you know it's good to be next to somebody who's going through some of the
[01:48:37.255 --> 01:48:42.055]   same hell that we are. But I think I've done this whole 15 months wrong.
[01:48:42.271 --> 01:48:46.153]  A lot of it's been, woe is me, why isn't the conservative movement doing this or that?
[01:48:46.633 --> 01:48:55.277]   And then I've been watching the series The Chosen, which has been really good, and I've been getting some counseling from some Christian friends, and they're just like, You gotta smile through this more, Ali.
[01:48:55.777 --> 01:48:59.400]  And so, you know, I think that, I think that, like, that's my task.
[01:48:59.480 --> 01:49:01.301]  That's kind of my cross to bury right now.
[01:49:01.581 --> 01:49:07.624]  But everybody, everybody, if you're listening to this, you are a part of this and you can play a role in this.
[01:49:07.644 --> 01:49:09.025]  You need to red pill your neighbor.
[01:49:09.325 --> 01:49:19.371]  You need to make prophetic statements about the J6 committee and what they're going to do to you and your neighbors so that when that time comes around, your neighbor says, wow, that person's right.
[01:49:19.511 --> 01:49:20.712]  What channel do they watch?
[01:49:20.892 --> 01:49:21.933]  Well, they watch InfoWars.
[01:49:22.293 --> 01:49:23.193]  That's totally true.
[01:49:23.273 --> 01:49:26.675]  God wants to see us do the right thing now when we're under attack.
[01:49:26.895 --> 01:49:27.815]  Yeah, and it's hard.
[01:49:28.015 --> 01:49:28.595]  I mean, it's hard.
[01:49:28.615 --> 01:49:31.416]  This is the toughest time in my life.
[01:49:31.856 --> 01:49:36.098]  I have lost close friends, allies, family members, money.
[01:49:36.458 --> 01:49:37.158]  Most of my money.
[01:49:38.158 --> 01:49:39.339]  My life savings is gone.
[01:49:39.719 --> 01:49:44.540]  You know, I've had to secretly subcontract on two campaigns, but now that's over.
[01:49:46.341 --> 01:49:48.464]  You know, if you're going through hell, just keep on going.
[01:49:48.985 --> 01:49:52.789]  And I have to believe that there's a great awakening happened with the American people.
[01:49:52.850 --> 01:49:53.991]  And I think that they're pissed.
[01:49:54.251 --> 01:49:57.295]  But let's not be so pissed that we give them exactly what they want.
[01:49:57.335 --> 01:50:04.785]  So, you know, we have to be... This is the only thing we have to be moderate about is our anger, you know, towards the deep state, I think.
[01:50:05.751 --> 01:50:06.172]  It's true.
[01:50:06.252 --> 01:50:08.534]  So clearly, what are they going to do next?
[01:50:08.895 --> 01:50:09.976]  They're obsessing over it.
[01:50:10.016 --> 01:50:10.917]  It's their whole agenda.
[01:50:11.458 --> 01:50:15.062]  Everything they do is make people hate them, but they just go, January 6th, watch, you'll see what happens.
[01:50:15.542 --> 01:50:16.904]  Clearly, they're planning something big.
[01:50:17.464 --> 01:50:18.065]  Something huge.
[01:50:18.165 --> 01:50:19.767]  And it's not just this election, Alex.
[01:50:20.027 --> 01:50:21.229]  It's both elections.
[01:50:21.289 --> 01:50:21.729]  It's 2022 and it's 2024.
[01:50:21.769 --> 01:50:23.451]  About 2022, it's about capping the red wave.
[01:50:26.755 --> 01:50:27.835]  You have to think about it this way.
[01:50:28.095 --> 01:50:32.196]  If Kevin McCarthy gets too large a red wave, the conservatives are in control.
[01:50:32.536 --> 01:50:36.177]  If Kevin McCarthy just gets a little off the tip-top, then he's in control.
[01:50:36.537 --> 01:50:38.437]  And then we're just going to have horrible legislation.
[01:50:38.637 --> 01:50:40.058]  They're not going to go on offense.
[01:50:40.238 --> 01:50:42.478]  We're not going to have a committee that investigates the summer riots.
[01:50:42.498 --> 01:50:50.440]  We're not going to have a reverse J6 committee to investigate the insurrection that happened on November 3rd and the FBI setup that happened on January 6th.
[01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:51.580]  We're not going to have any of that.
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:51:06.475]  So what they're trying to do, and this is what Mitt Romney and Liz Cheney are doing, they're setting us up for a tiny red wave so that they can control it, and then 2024 will all be about pinning DeSantis and Trump against each other by taking Trump off of a ballot or two.
[01:51:06.715 --> 01:51:09.097]  I mean, this is the coup, part three.
[01:51:09.377 --> 01:51:13.602]  And what's frustrating is, Ollie, you're a very successful political analyst, people respect you.
[01:51:13.802 --> 01:51:14.042]  Yeah.
[01:51:15.163 --> 01:51:19.867]  And I know this stuff and our audience knows this, but mainline Republicans don't even get any of this.
[01:51:19.907 --> 01:51:20.828]  They won't touch it.
[01:51:21.128 --> 01:51:22.009]  They won't touch it.
[01:51:23.731 --> 01:51:25.132]  Alex, they really won't touch it.
[01:51:25.152 --> 01:51:32.899]  They're like, OK, everything you're saying, Ollie, you know, shows that you've read up on these state ballot access laws and you're watching, you know, Elias and what he's doing.
[01:51:33.199 --> 01:51:34.080]  But, you know, they just.
[01:51:35.370 --> 01:51:43.993]  By the way, Elias is trying to get a bunch of Republicans banned from, like, MTG because they question election fraud, which is your right to do.
[01:51:44.634 --> 01:51:45.714]  It's so much worse.
[01:51:45.774 --> 01:51:55.798]  I got a call from a source in Atlanta yesterday and just, you know, the green light the Democrats have at the state level and the federal level, nobody's ever seen anything like this in this country.
[01:51:56.178 --> 01:52:01.908]   Right now there are active measures in 12 different states And none of it's public.
[01:52:02.088 --> 01:52:03.249]  I've never seen anything like it.
[01:52:03.269 --> 01:52:04.509]  Explain what active measures means.
[01:52:04.709 --> 01:52:09.231]  Well, you know, active measures in the community intelligence is, you know, when somebody's doing something.
[01:52:09.871 --> 01:52:22.695]  And what's happening, what must be a criminal enterprise and what must be a criminal conspiracy is that you have state attorney generals, county attorney, district attorneys, and then U.S.
[01:52:23.556 --> 01:52:26.417]  attorneys impaneling grand juries everywhere.
[01:52:27.737 --> 01:52:34.060]  I went public on my grand jury because the New York Times was going to go public on it anyway, so I had a choice of giving comment or not giving comment.
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:41.503]  But folks, my sources are telling me at the state level, they've got other grand juries, and they want to take MTG and all other people off the ballot.
[01:52:41.823 --> 01:52:46.104]  And in civil matters, I have top lawyers, they go, we've never seen judges do this.
[01:52:46.565 --> 01:52:48.385]  They just are raping us, our rights.
[01:52:48.705 --> 01:52:49.226]  Total rape!
[01:52:49.286 --> 01:52:51.547]  It's a Democrat globalist coup, folks.
[01:52:51.847 --> 01:52:53.948]  They know America woke up, they're trying to block us.
[01:52:54.228 --> 01:52:54.748]  We'll be right back.
[01:52:56.005 --> 01:52:57.666]  Ali Alexander is here with us.
[01:52:57.686 --> 01:53:00.787]  He's going to be popping in on the war room today with Owen Schroyer coming up at 3 p.m.
[01:53:00.807 --> 01:53:01.067]  today.
[01:53:01.787 --> 01:53:07.209]  We've got this big Epoch Times investigative report on feds confirmed embedded in Jan 6.
[01:53:08.349 --> 01:53:20.556]   20 federal assets embedded at Capitol on Jan 6 court filing says oath keepers motion seeks to dismiss Seditious conspiracy charges, and we have that legal document right here.
[01:53:20.976 --> 01:53:26.921]  This is a big deal because they're trying to frame America and label all opposition off January 6th as terrorists.
[01:53:27.301 --> 01:53:29.303]  That's why conservatives need to take this seriously.
[01:53:29.683 --> 01:53:32.806]  We need to take it seriously, and our side's not taking it seriously enough.
[01:53:32.826 --> 01:53:36.349]  You know, I'm done combating the other side.
[01:53:36.769 --> 01:53:39.110]  What we need to do is we need to wake up other lions.
[01:53:39.671 --> 01:53:42.653]  We need to wake up our allies and start going into war.
[01:53:43.033 --> 01:53:47.095]  You know, Alex, I think I said it on your air because I've certainly said it in private enough times.
[01:53:47.576 --> 01:53:55.301]  Folks, it was BuzzFeed News that exonerated these guys in Michigan with the Whitmer case that's a fake.
[01:53:56.101 --> 01:53:57.122]  Kidnapping case, okay?
[01:53:57.303 --> 01:53:59.165]  Which was a prelude to J6.
[01:53:59.305 --> 01:54:00.346]  And why did they do that?
[01:54:00.386 --> 01:54:03.490]  It's the whole liberal gamble, and a liberal publication first exposes it.
[01:54:03.771 --> 01:54:05.793]  I think, again, I think it's accidental.
[01:54:06.013 --> 01:54:13.843]  What happens is you file a FOIA request, and you're like, you start tugging at it, and then what they want to do is that they want to go viral, they want to do good journalism, and yadda yadda yadda.
[01:54:13.863 --> 01:54:15.165]  Yeah, there's a real drive to tell the truth.
[01:54:15.325 --> 01:54:28.012]  Yeah, so occasionally, and frankly, this is what, you know, back in the Twitter days, Mike Cernovich, me, and Jack Pasopic, when Harvey Weinstein was going through his thing, it actually started dying after the 72-hour mark.
[01:54:28.032 --> 01:54:28.873]  It was a mini-news cycle.
[01:54:31.454 --> 01:54:37.838]  And then what we did is we incentivized the journalists by dangling women who like had DM'd us and all kinds of other stuff.
[01:54:38.138 --> 01:54:42.982]  You know, these aren't conservative people in Hollywood, but they were people who were looking for an outlet and journalists wouldn't listen.
[01:54:43.282 --> 01:54:48.885]  And you would dangle that in front of people like Yashar Ali, who is the most obese, disgusting journalist out there.
[01:54:49.426 --> 01:54:50.927]  And they would start doing stories.
[01:54:50.947 --> 01:54:57.331]  So what happens, and Andrew Breitbart got this, is what you have to do in major stories like this is change the incentive program.
[01:54:57.631 --> 01:55:05.673]  And if you change the incentive program, then you incentivize those independent journalists and these journalists who want to get hired at a different outlet.
[01:55:05.833 --> 01:55:08.153]  And so what happened with BuzzFeed is they did the FOIA request.
[01:55:08.173 --> 01:55:09.934]  They found out the FBI was hiding something.
[01:55:10.194 --> 01:55:11.834]  They pulled a string that they didn't know.
[01:55:12.494 --> 01:55:22.836]  And seriously, I'm not going to thank BuzzFeed because they are total trash, but they did 90% of the legal legwork for these guys in Michigan.
[01:55:22.936 --> 01:55:24.417]  And now it's all been confirmed.
[01:55:24.457 --> 01:55:25.737]  This is so seismic.
[01:55:26.357 --> 01:55:35.022]  Because the same FBI people running the Whitmer kidnapping, where they wanted to trick their people to cut her head off, now they were caught running Jam 6, it's come out.
[01:55:35.283 --> 01:55:48.231]  Right, and so what it turns out is that the agent in charge, okay, of overseeing all these other corrupt agents, who totally, they violate the FBI handbook, they violated protocol, and the protocol's pretty liberal after 9-11.
[01:55:48.911 --> 01:56:03.838]  You can basically, as an FBI agent, do what you want to convince somebody, whether it's a young Muslim or a white patriot, you can convince them to say anything and then send them to jail with no intention of really committing a crime.
[01:56:04.498 --> 01:56:09.902]  And, you know, and shame on us on the right for somehow, you know, I participated in that when I was younger.
[01:56:09.942 --> 01:56:16.586]  And, you know, I hate that I ever participated in kind of stigmatizing other Americans, even if they didn't believe what I believed.
[01:56:17.127 --> 01:56:22.090]  But now looking back on it, so anyway, this guy in Michigan was moved over to D.C.
[01:56:22.150 --> 01:56:24.012]  to oversee the January 6th cases.
[01:56:24.052 --> 01:56:28.815]  So what you're watching is, you know, the death of law and order.
[01:56:28.915 --> 01:56:32.938]  And this is what I really want to point out that a lot of people other than lawyers can't appreciate.
[01:56:34.676 --> 01:56:48.698]  When there are confirmed assets in an environment that goes from a protest to a riot, what you need to understand is that there are nearly 800 people charged, okay?
[01:56:50.099 --> 01:56:55.800]  The Constitution and common law say that you're allowed to build what's called an adequate defense, okay?
[01:56:55.980 --> 01:56:57.720]  That's not a phrase out of nowhere.
[01:56:57.980 --> 01:57:02.441]  That is the standard by which the state must guarantee someone who is charged.
[01:57:03.226 --> 01:57:08.549]  Well, no one can build an adequate defense if the government has not given disclosure.
[01:57:08.829 --> 01:57:10.230]  And so let me tell the government this.
[01:57:10.450 --> 01:57:22.397]  Yes, I regularly talk to J6 defendant lawyers, over 30 of them, and they tell me about the evidence that they're looking at on these secure laptops, and they're not allowed to make it public.
[01:57:22.637 --> 01:57:24.078]  So they can't talk to anybody about it.
[01:57:24.118 --> 01:57:25.218]  They can't screenshot it.
[01:57:25.258 --> 01:57:26.199]  They can't do anything.
[01:57:26.619 --> 01:57:27.839]  The judges won't let it.
[01:57:28.140 --> 01:57:32.101]  And this evidence, in one case, would exonerate five other cases.
[01:57:32.381 --> 01:57:36.903]  So what you're watching is a slow-moving train wreck of plea deals.
[01:57:37.184 --> 01:57:39.825]  And what happens is— And have they sent the president for this?
[01:57:39.845 --> 01:57:40.085]  Yes.
[01:57:40.145 --> 01:57:42.326]  It's the model for all the rest of the country.
[01:57:42.526 --> 01:57:45.647]  Right, and so what happens is, let's say I get 20 plea deals.
[01:57:46.147 --> 01:57:48.148]  Well then this next person takes the plea deal.
[01:57:48.568 --> 01:58:00.393]  And then they get a harsher sentence because they didn't, or they get taken to a jury trial or a bench trial, and then they get convicted, and then, well they get a harsher sentence because they have to have a harsher sentence than the plea deal.
[01:58:00.693 --> 01:58:09.058]   And so what happens is, when the exonerating information comes out here, and then all these people who got a plea deal, Say, well, actually we want to revisit it.
[01:58:09.238 --> 01:58:11.800]  The judges say, nope, we're going to quash that motion.
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:12.721]  We're going to quash that.
[01:58:13.021 --> 01:58:19.087]  Or when these people say, I want a new trial, the appellate court will say, no, because your trial was conducted fairly.
[01:58:19.107 --> 01:58:20.128]  Wally, let me ask you this.
[01:58:22.130 --> 01:58:23.871]  I've been asked, what happened to Gen 6?
[01:58:24.011 --> 01:58:24.632]  I don't know.
[01:58:25.072 --> 01:58:26.053]  We went and had a big rally.
[01:58:26.113 --> 01:58:27.615]  It got hijacked, taken control of.
[01:58:27.995 --> 01:58:30.477]  We know there was some feds there, some patriots did some dumb stuff.
[01:58:31.158 --> 01:58:32.419]  We know the Feds infiltrated.
[01:58:32.439 --> 01:58:33.239]  We know they were watching.
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:34.761]  We know they wouldn't give the National Guard.
[01:58:35.121 --> 01:58:36.942]  We know they sent half the Capitol Police away.
[01:58:36.962 --> 01:58:38.943]  We need an investigation of the Feds.
[01:58:39.003 --> 01:58:39.564]  Who does that?
[01:58:40.404 --> 01:58:41.025]  Who does that?
[01:58:41.225 --> 01:58:42.586]  We need a special counsel.
[01:58:43.106 --> 01:58:43.507]  We need it.
[01:58:43.547 --> 01:58:45.548]  We absolutely need a special counsel.
[01:58:46.168 --> 01:58:49.931]  And in Congress, what you want is the committees that have subpoena power.
[01:58:50.592 --> 01:58:55.155]  And so there's only, you know, a couple committees in the House that have subpoena power.
[01:58:55.935 --> 01:58:59.456]  And, you know, this is the power to compel someone to show up.
[01:58:59.876 --> 01:59:04.837]  And so the Intelligence Committee, the Judiciary Committee, these are committees that you want in it.
[01:59:04.877 --> 01:59:07.598]  Now, if it's the Intelligence Committee, most of their work will be done in secret.
[01:59:07.618 --> 01:59:12.539]  So really, it's like you want the Oversight or the Judiciary Committee conducting this.
[01:59:12.699 --> 01:59:15.460]  But what we really need to do is we need to chop up the investigation.
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:23.762]  So I would give oversight over the FBI and government officials, National Guard, National Archives and all that other stuff to the House.
[01:59:24.822 --> 01:59:25.903]  Uh, oversight committee.
[01:59:26.744 --> 01:59:33.010]  As far as these secret federal agents and the shoot-to-kill agents, the ones that had kill orders that were defending Pence.
[01:59:33.070 --> 01:59:34.572]  Upwards of a thousand of them.
[01:59:35.533 --> 01:59:38.536]  Imagine, like, you and I almost stopped it from happening.
[01:59:38.576 --> 01:59:39.477]  Yeah.
[01:59:39.517 --> 01:59:42.179]  Imagine if we had a thousand feds with us saying, don't go in the Capitol.
[01:59:42.279 --> 01:59:48.038]   And right, and we're criticized for leaving and exiting the chaos scene and being on a
[01:59:48.038 --> 01:59:52.519]   rooftop while other people are on a rooftop with guns and snipers.
[01:59:52.519 --> 01:59:54.759]  You know, and there's no criticism of the government.
[01:59:54.759 --> 02:00:00.158]   So I would give that to the Senate Judiciary Committee or the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[02:00:00.158 --> 02:00:03.239]   But we absolutely need a special counsel and that means we need to win the White House.
[02:00:03.239 --> 02:00:07.638]   And the reason it's important is they're branding all American opposition and official government
[02:00:07.638 --> 02:00:11.939]   documents as anybody that questions elections or lockdowns or anything is a terrorist.
[02:00:11.939 --> 02:00:17.299]   They are literally- If you wear camouflage to a rally from now on, you get what's
[02:00:17.299 --> 02:00:19.479]  called an FBI threat tag.
[02:00:19.760 --> 02:00:20.000]  Okay?
[02:00:20.180 --> 02:00:21.280]  That hasn't always been the case.
[02:00:21.501 --> 02:00:22.001]  Think about this.
[02:00:22.161 --> 02:00:23.761]  We survived the Tea Party.
[02:00:24.001 --> 02:00:26.402]  We survived the Giffords shooting.
[02:00:26.642 --> 02:00:33.104]   We survived all of those controversies where still you could wear militia gear and not Automatically get tagged.
[02:00:33.424 --> 02:00:51.148]  Now, because of January 6th and what they did to our beautiful, peaceful protest, if you wear camouflage at any protest across this country and the FBI can identify you, you get what's called an FBI threat tag associated with you, and you get an FBI profile created for you.
[02:00:51.508 --> 02:00:57.809]  That establishes probable cause for other policing units inside of our government.
[02:00:58.209 --> 02:01:02.652]  Ali Alexander, how do we stop a civil war the globalists are trying to trigger?
[02:01:03.092 --> 02:01:04.793]  How do we de-escalate this?
[02:01:05.253 --> 02:01:10.296]  Well, you know, in that I want to answer the question you just asked, what happened January 6th?
[02:01:10.436 --> 02:01:10.837]  I don't know.
[02:01:11.237 --> 02:01:19.882]  And I'm actually convinced that some of the conspiracy ends and then Satan's domain starts.
[02:01:20.422 --> 02:01:39.370]   Because I, you know, You follow this stuff way more than I have, you know, and you've done it for over 25 years, and I have a great understanding of campaigns, large organizations, and government, but I don't see something like this fully cooperating with each other without a supernatural force influencing everything.
[02:01:39.630 --> 02:01:43.211]  You just can't coordinate 20,000 people to kind of cooperate.
[02:01:43.331 --> 02:01:54.033]   I mean, it took Trump being betrayed by operatives at the Ellipse by not giving the people instructions to Other things, I'll just leave that out in the middle.
[02:01:54.073 --> 02:01:55.413]  And then they don't send Trump there.
[02:01:55.693 --> 02:02:00.574]  Yeah, and I mean, it took every element of our government failing, every organizer failing.
[02:02:00.854 --> 02:02:04.615]  It's, I mean, it's kind of spooky, but so how do we prevent a civil war?
[02:02:05.135 --> 02:02:05.635]  I mean it.
[02:02:05.795 --> 02:02:09.036]  It's not a cheesy Christian line when I say, first we must pray.
[02:02:09.656 --> 02:02:11.717]  You know, because... Ali Alexander, I totally agree.
[02:02:11.757 --> 02:02:14.477]  Let's come right back and talk about this and so much more.
[02:02:14.837 --> 02:02:15.758]  Ali Alexander is our guest.
[02:02:16.258 --> 02:02:16.878]  All right, we're back.
[02:02:18.342 --> 02:02:22.967]  Kate Dowling takes over in the fourth hour ahead of Owen Schroyer in the war room.
[02:02:24.168 --> 02:02:25.470]  And Ollie's going to be popping in on that show.
[02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:27.051]  We appreciate him staying in Austin to do that.
[02:02:27.092 --> 02:02:27.772]  He lives in Dallas.
[02:02:28.453 --> 02:02:30.075]  Ollie, I see headlines like this everywhere.
[02:02:30.115 --> 02:02:31.837]  Democrat death march to November.
[02:02:32.658 --> 02:02:33.939]  Everything they're doing is hurting them.
[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:36.321]  They seem not to care.
[02:02:36.922 --> 02:02:38.244]  They're under orders to do something.
[02:02:38.344 --> 02:02:39.365]  Why are they so arrogant?
[02:02:40.526 --> 02:02:46.009]  You know, well one, they have collaboration and cooperation from Rhino Republicans.
[02:02:46.269 --> 02:02:48.510]  So like I said, that's to temper the red wave.
[02:02:48.530 --> 02:02:50.111]  So they know that's coming, okay?
[02:02:50.631 --> 02:03:02.357]  So imagine when the J6 report comes out, and then the DOJ weeks later announces Soviet-style charges, and then they get denounced by Republicans.
[02:03:02.657 --> 02:03:11.541]  Alex, I was talking to someone, I was talking to a conservative publisher, and I explained to that conservative publisher, you don't need to convince the public.
[02:03:11.961 --> 02:03:20.344]  They need to chill white women who have ping-ponged between the two parties, and that affects like 30 or 40 different districts in America.
[02:03:20.384 --> 02:03:27.007]   So it's like Fulton County, it's Orange County in California, and that means the difference Of this many seats.
[02:03:27.047 --> 02:03:31.211]  And so, they're targeting white women, okay, with these things.
[02:03:31.471 --> 02:03:37.737]  And white women don't like scandals, they don't like the accusation of being called a racist, but they don't like CRT.
[02:03:37.957 --> 02:03:42.541]  So right now we have CRT turning out white women in record numbers for the Republican Party.
[02:03:42.561 --> 02:03:43.602]  We're gonna hammer CRT.
[02:03:43.902 --> 02:03:44.822]  Yeah, we gotta hammer it.
[02:03:44.882 --> 02:03:53.665]  You know, if I was advising, you know, some of these giant Republican organizations, I would say CRT is something that the Tea Party stopped to steal and Trump wasn't.
[02:03:53.925 --> 02:03:57.806]  Because these white women know their little five-year-old white babies aren't a racist.
[02:03:58.207 --> 02:04:02.248]  They know their babies ain't a racist and they know they don't want them to come home and call them a racist.
[02:04:02.968 --> 02:04:07.233]  You know, you know, when you send your kid to college you think they might come home and call me a racist?
[02:04:07.474 --> 02:04:14.461]  You don't send your elementary school to child to elementary and think, well, they're gonna want to sex change and call me racist.
[02:04:14.581 --> 02:04:17.305]  They're also exactly the LGBT sex change stuff.
[02:04:17.785 --> 02:04:22.427]  Yeah, I mean the agenda's just rampant and that's what, you know, we gotta take it out of our language.
[02:04:22.527 --> 02:04:23.387]  It's not a movement.
[02:04:23.687 --> 02:04:27.689]  You know, most of the gay community is not in favor of what they're doing.
[02:04:27.989 --> 02:04:30.630]  There's nothing to do with that, it's just a power trip.
[02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:32.051]  It's a power trip, you know.
[02:04:32.451 --> 02:04:36.473]  Teachers unions, post-Marxism, end of America.
[02:04:36.593 --> 02:04:41.515]  And if they can form a sexual relationship with your child, whether it's heterosexual or whatever, they've got control.
[02:04:41.815 --> 02:04:42.636]  Total control.
[02:04:42.676 --> 02:04:43.636]  I mean, think about that.
[02:04:43.797 --> 02:04:44.997]  I mean, just one issue.
[02:04:45.238 --> 02:04:48.940]  You turn that kid on, one issue, and it radicalizes them for all the rest.
[02:04:49.081 --> 02:04:49.741]  I mean, think about that.
[02:04:49.801 --> 02:04:51.442]  Why would a gay person want higher taxes?
[02:04:51.783 --> 02:04:57.887]  Why would a gay person want selective abortions, which would inherently kill people who, you know, are allegedly born gay or whatever?
[02:04:58.167 --> 02:05:00.809]  So, you know, this is just a dark thing.
[02:05:00.849 --> 02:05:10.819]   So when we see the Democrat death march to November, It is both about tempering the red wave, which they know that they will do in cooperation with corporate forces and rhino forces.
[02:05:11.379 --> 02:05:13.581]  They can afford to wait till August, folks, okay?
[02:05:14.262 --> 02:05:22.670]  And don't forget, remember the Parkland shooting I think was in February, and a reporter calls me and says, you know, don't you think your party needs to address this by November?
[02:05:22.690 --> 02:05:25.153]  I said, nobody will remember it by November, and no one did.
[02:05:25.353 --> 02:05:26.673]  Okay, so think about this.
[02:05:26.813 --> 02:05:32.075]  Everything we're talking about now is not what they have slated for us to talk about in the fall.
[02:05:32.335 --> 02:05:34.576]  And Republicans never get this.
[02:05:35.036 --> 02:05:38.076]  And they don't see the pre-programming getting ready for that event.
[02:05:38.537 --> 02:05:39.097]  We can see it.
[02:05:39.137 --> 02:05:43.458]  It's terror attacks by patriots, mass shootings, Civil War stuff.
[02:05:43.678 --> 02:05:50.967]  Yeah, I mean, don't forget, you had Hunter Biden laptop cover-up, so this was to take away the negative.
[02:05:51.367 --> 02:05:58.736]  And then the positive argument they were making was, they're trying to kidnap the governor of Michigan, who was almost the VP nominee.
[02:05:58.996 --> 02:06:03.583]  I mean, she secretly, folks, she was Biden's number one pick for VP.
[02:06:03.883 --> 02:06:07.989]  It wasn't until Alex Soros and the Soros family interfered did they get Kamala Harris.
[02:06:08.009 --> 02:06:09.151]  But he wanted Whitmer.
[02:06:09.451 --> 02:06:10.353]  He wanted Klobuchar.
[02:06:10.693 --> 02:06:12.836]  And he did not want Kamala on the top five.
[02:06:12.876 --> 02:06:15.320]  So, you know, so just think about this.
[02:06:15.680 --> 02:06:19.242]  In the positive, they construct this argument, like this is what we do in debate.
[02:06:19.562 --> 02:06:23.904]  In the positive, their contention was they want to kidnap Whitmer.
[02:06:24.145 --> 02:06:26.026]  This is a mainstream Republican thought.
[02:06:26.406 --> 02:06:27.186]  This is dangerous.
[02:06:27.206 --> 02:06:29.187]  You need to control it by throwing Trump out.
[02:06:29.267 --> 02:06:30.248]  That's how you punish it.
[02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:40.055]  And then, over here in the negative, they say, well, Hunter Biden, you know, has nothing to do, even though they spent all this time on Trump Jr., Eric, and Ivanka, and the rest of them.
[02:06:40.275 --> 02:06:42.076]  Maybe they should spend more time on Ivanka, honestly.
[02:06:42.376 --> 02:06:46.178]  But, you know, that's my personal... So what do you think of the Democrats betting on January 6th?
[02:06:46.258 --> 02:06:48.580]  Because right now they're losing on that.
[02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:50.621]  How do they gin that up?
[02:06:50.701 --> 02:06:51.802]  They're exiting politics.
[02:06:52.122 --> 02:06:54.503]  I mean, they are exiting politics and they are entering war.
[02:06:54.843 --> 02:07:00.125]  You know, what was it, that Prussian military theorist, you know, said that... Bismarck.
[02:07:00.405 --> 02:07:00.965]  Yeah.
[02:07:00.985 --> 02:07:04.987]  He said, he said, war is just the end of politics.
[02:07:05.127 --> 02:07:05.607]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:07:05.827 --> 02:07:07.608]  And politics... It's just the next level of politics.
[02:07:07.688 --> 02:07:07.948]  Yeah.
[02:07:07.988 --> 02:07:08.828]  And politics has failed.
[02:07:09.048 --> 02:07:12.070]  Pull up the Bismarck quote on war, guys, it'll come up.
[02:07:12.090 --> 02:07:23.418]  Yeah, so people have to understand, we're exiting politics, we're entering philosophy or political theory, and these hacks, these total hacks on Fox News, no offense, they're not going to cut it.
[02:07:23.538 --> 02:07:24.719]  Karl Rove's not going to cut it.
[02:07:24.919 --> 02:07:26.861]  There's no way to vote yourself out of it.
[02:07:26.881 --> 02:07:28.862]  Politics or an extension of war by other means, something like that.
[02:07:29.102 --> 02:07:32.766]  Yeah, they've, you know, they've really translated it like 10 different ways from Sunday.
[02:07:33.086 --> 02:07:38.972]  But essentially what people need to understand is that, you know, we're all fighting over goods, okay?
[02:07:39.793 --> 02:07:40.333]  Economics.
[02:07:40.954 --> 02:07:43.236]  And we usually do that through conquest.
[02:07:44.019 --> 02:07:49.384]  And then when we choose to do that through trade, a currency requires a government.
[02:07:49.844 --> 02:07:53.247]  A government requires consent, so that there's civil order.
[02:07:53.267 --> 02:07:59.172]  And they've broken- They've broken- Klaus Schwab admits we're breaking the social contract to build back better.
[02:07:59.752 --> 02:08:01.654]  People need to know, though, he's not building back better.
[02:08:01.714 --> 02:08:03.215]  He's not building back better.
[02:08:03.435 --> 02:08:05.477]  They're building neo-feudalism back better.
[02:08:05.677 --> 02:08:08.159]  That's what they're doing, a techno-neo-feudalism.
[02:08:08.439 --> 02:08:09.100]  And they say that!
[02:08:10.779 --> 02:08:15.940]  The war is nothing but a continuation of politics with the admixture of other means.
[02:08:16.801 --> 02:08:23.082]  Yeah, they really brought up the most confusing... And that's an even older quote, that's the guy that trained George Washington's troops.
[02:08:23.543 --> 02:08:27.124]  So what people have to realize is that we mean it when we say pray.
[02:08:27.604 --> 02:08:27.984]  Why?
[02:08:28.324 --> 02:08:29.624]  Because we need God's intercession.
[02:08:29.904 --> 02:08:32.105]  There has to be a change in our consciousness.
[02:08:32.185 --> 02:08:34.626]  I'm not one of these New Age Christ Consciousness folks or whatever.
[02:08:34.646 --> 02:08:35.127]  No, but it's true.
[02:08:35.167 --> 02:08:38.468]  When we all change our consciousness and get it, that's when we win.
[02:08:38.828 --> 02:08:40.009]  Yeah, and that's what we have to do.
[02:08:40.049 --> 02:08:43.911]  And that's what Jesus did in contrast to the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
[02:08:44.271 --> 02:08:47.613]  He said, there's a different way to abide by the law.
[02:08:47.933 --> 02:08:49.554]  And by the way, now it's universal.
[02:08:50.014 --> 02:08:58.780]  And so we need to have a different way of saying, we believe in these archetypes and we believe in these traditions and you don't need to pay attention to the Republican label or the conservative label anymore.
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:00.841]  These work for humanity.
[02:09:01.081 --> 02:09:04.484]  They've led to a population of 7 billion people and we should applaud that.
[02:09:04.624 --> 02:09:05.945]  And we want to go to 10 billion.
[02:09:06.245 --> 02:09:08.386]  We need to... We want to go interstellar.
[02:09:08.446 --> 02:09:08.847]  Exactly.
[02:09:08.887 --> 02:09:12.489]  So there's a move though to get rid of what works because the globalists have their new model.
[02:09:12.529 --> 02:09:13.730]  They want to bring in transhumanism.
[02:09:13.870 --> 02:09:16.171]  It's super weird because they're archaic.
[02:09:16.512 --> 02:09:18.253]  They are everything they say about us.
[02:09:18.273 --> 02:09:18.913]  They're the pagans.
[02:09:18.973 --> 02:09:19.814]  They're the cavemen.
[02:09:20.074 --> 02:09:22.075]  You know, we're the people who are dreaming.
[02:09:22.095 --> 02:09:23.336]  Loving and coming together.
[02:09:23.356 --> 02:09:23.636]  Yeah.
[02:09:23.656 --> 02:09:24.537]  And they claim we're not.
[02:09:24.657 --> 02:09:25.117]  Yeah.
[02:09:25.557 --> 02:09:29.439]  You know, like, let's not forget, it was the church that added harmony to music.
[02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:32.801]  It was the church that funded art that led to the Renaissance.
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:39.661]   And so in a lot of ways, we are always seeking on the right to commune with God in innovative
[02:09:39.661 --> 02:09:44.779]   ways that don't get rid of tradition that roots us at a civil society.
[02:09:44.779 --> 02:09:46.939]  Whereas they are the exact opposite.
[02:09:46.939 --> 02:09:51.260]   They want brutalism, ugly stuff, and they want to kill people and they want to...
[02:09:51.260 --> 02:09:52.260]  Look at the media.
[02:09:52.260 --> 02:09:56.059]   All it sells is ugliness and death to get us to not recognize good from bad.
[02:09:56.059 --> 02:09:57.260]  They're ugly.
[02:09:57.260 --> 02:09:58.420]  They're fat.
[02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:00.140]  They require a lot of makeup.
[02:10:00.140 --> 02:10:02.059]  You know, everybody now has a Snapchat.
[02:10:01.905 --> 02:10:06.784]   filter on Zoom. I mean it's just it's just crazy we've we've lost ourselves in
[02:10:06.784 --> 02:10:12.466]   this madness but because we've betrayed those values we Republicans we can
[02:10:12.466 --> 02:10:16.664]   agree so what do you predict for the midterms in 209 days you know I don't
[02:10:16.664 --> 02:10:21.185]   have any predictions I I've never seen a midterm in my career where the
[02:10:21.185 --> 02:10:25.425]   opposition party is most certainly going to take power and the opposition leader
[02:10:25.425 --> 02:10:30.666]   Kevin McCarthy doesn't have a proposal doesn't have promises
[02:10:29.236 --> 02:10:35.859]  And frankly, frankly, and I'm going to just talk directly to Paul Gosar and the Freedom Caucus and Marjorie.
[02:10:36.399 --> 02:10:44.942]  Folks, you need to start getting Kevin McCarthy on the record with select committees and proposals that will get instant votes.
[02:10:45.503 --> 02:10:48.404]  And he needs to cooperate with whipping those votes.
[02:10:48.584 --> 02:10:51.685]  They're just like Trump three years ago when they had both the House and Senate.
[02:10:52.046 --> 02:10:52.646]  They did nothing.
[02:10:52.906 --> 02:10:55.147]  They did nothing and it was actually worse than nothing.
[02:10:55.527 --> 02:11:01.390]  Mitch McConnell went to Trump privately and said, I want to focus on the tax cut.
[02:11:01.590 --> 02:11:04.931]  Trump said, you've promised your party repeal.
[02:11:05.512 --> 02:11:07.452]  OK, so I was on the repeal side of the argument.
[02:11:07.553 --> 02:11:09.774]  I was I was having all these talks at the White House and stuff.
[02:11:10.234 --> 02:11:13.435]  And so Mitch McConnell said, OK, I'll teach you a lesson.
[02:11:13.675 --> 02:11:14.616]  So we did repeal.
[02:11:15.652 --> 02:11:18.094]  And then, you know, John McCain does that famous thumbs down.
[02:11:18.114 --> 02:11:19.836]  He coordinates that with Mitch McConnell.
[02:11:20.036 --> 02:11:23.940]  Mitch McConnell then goes to Trump and says, OK, I did my due diligence, Mr. President.
[02:11:23.960 --> 02:11:25.101]  Can we now do tax cuts?
[02:11:25.481 --> 02:11:38.272]  We do the tax cuts in such a way in which we lose our seats in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York and California with how we decide by getting rid of the property tax exemption.
[02:11:38.993 --> 02:11:43.244]  So, so, I mean, people, you know, I'm not just some, like, weirdo.
[02:11:43.444 --> 02:11:45.108]  No, they wrote it to turn everybody against Trump.
[02:11:45.148 --> 02:11:47.755]  They did, and they wrote it so that we would lose the majority in 2018.
[02:11:49.195 --> 02:11:51.716]  So I mean, folks, they're setting it all up.
[02:11:51.736 --> 02:11:53.517]  Why would you get rid of a tax exemption?
[02:11:53.537 --> 02:11:54.037]  We want those.
[02:11:54.157 --> 02:11:56.198]  Yeah, we want we want those tax exemptions.
[02:11:56.298 --> 02:11:57.519]  And we needed them.
[02:11:57.779 --> 02:12:00.780]  We needed them because we don't run even in New Jersey.
[02:12:01.040 --> 02:12:05.302]  Again, it's New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and then mainly Los Angeles.
[02:12:05.442 --> 02:12:07.963]  Well, the left was scared because New Jersey and New York were going for Trump.
[02:12:08.263 --> 02:12:11.865]  They tricked Trump to get rid of the property tax exemption.
[02:12:12.065 --> 02:12:12.525]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:12:12.585 --> 02:12:15.106]  And look, as a conservative, I say that's not fair.
[02:12:15.446 --> 02:12:19.288]  But if somebody wants to cobble together a majority, I say we absolutely needed that.
[02:12:19.568 --> 02:12:21.128]  So they knew damn well what they were doing.
[02:12:21.368 --> 02:12:24.469]  And you know, the architect out of that is the congressman who's out of Houston.
[02:12:24.569 --> 02:12:27.190]  So, you know, it's, uh, you know, Kevin Brady.
[02:12:27.230 --> 02:12:29.351]  So, you know, it's just, it's a coup.
[02:12:29.411 --> 02:12:30.151]  It's always a coup.
[02:12:30.191 --> 02:12:31.112]  It's an ongoing coup.
[02:12:31.252 --> 02:12:35.933]  Let's talk about how we counter it in the last five minutes, and then Kate Daly takes over.
[02:12:36.273 --> 02:12:37.474]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[02:12:38.274 --> 02:12:39.394]  Ali, how do people find you?
[02:12:39.795 --> 02:12:41.495]  Telegram, Ali Alexander.
[02:12:41.735 --> 02:12:42.596]  We're right back, stay with us.
[02:12:46.357 --> 02:12:48.438]  I'm fighting the New World Order at point-blank range.
[02:12:48.618 --> 02:12:50.618]  We've had devastating victories in my life.
[02:12:50.819 --> 02:12:54.280]  I've put, thanks to you supporting us, a real dent in our operations.
[02:12:54.300 --> 02:12:55.400]  In fact, more than one dent.
[02:12:55.480 --> 02:12:59.882]  We have savaged them in a very, very hardcore way, thanks to you and us together.
[02:13:00.022 --> 02:13:02.723]  They want to destroy me because of it, because they're scared of us, and they should be.
[02:13:03.700 --> 02:13:05.501]  So I'll tell you, I'll go into the end no matter what happens.
[02:13:05.541 --> 02:13:07.402]  Whether we win, lose, I collapse.
[02:13:08.022 --> 02:13:10.283]  I'm just telling you, I've got more victory left in me.
[02:13:10.303 --> 02:13:12.665]  I'm long in the tooth now, folks.
[02:13:12.485 --> 02:13:19.485]  folks, 48 in a 28 year war is like I'm 100.
[02:13:19.485 --> 02:13:20.485]  Okay?
[02:13:20.485 --> 02:13:22.285]  The enemy looks and goes, he looks tired.
[02:13:23.247 --> 02:13:24.207]  Yeah, I look hurt.
[02:13:24.428 --> 02:13:26.850]  I've been stabbing your ass hard.
[02:13:27.570 --> 02:13:28.391]  I've been biting you.
[02:13:28.471 --> 02:13:29.652]  I've been, yeah.
[02:13:30.153 --> 02:13:31.254]  You bet I look bad.
[02:13:31.994 --> 02:13:35.798]  Because I've been putting my will against you for a long time.
[02:13:36.078 --> 02:13:37.339]  I have set the fires.
[02:13:37.539 --> 02:13:39.461]  We have prepared the resistance.
[02:13:39.581 --> 02:13:40.862]  We have laid the way.
[02:13:41.103 --> 02:13:41.983]  You bet I'm hurt.
[02:13:42.043 --> 02:13:43.325]  You bet I'm screwed up now.
[02:13:43.525 --> 02:13:44.786]  Ain't no going back now.
[02:13:44.806 --> 02:13:45.447]  I know.
[02:13:47.096 --> 02:13:53.558]  My best days are still here to come, but I can't fight these people in the ring for you.
[02:13:54.098 --> 02:14:03.920]  If you don't pray for me, and if you don't spread the word, and if you don't buy our products, and I'm telling you, I'm telling you, as sure as the sun came up this morning, if you don't support us financially, we're going to implode very, very soon.
[02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:06.801]  And the globalists are celebrating like chickens with their heads cut off.
[02:14:06.921 --> 02:14:07.561]  That's okay.
[02:14:07.601 --> 02:14:08.161]  That's what they do.
[02:14:07.980 --> 02:14:09.980]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:12.260]  (screaming)
[02:14:12.260 --> 02:14:14.581]  (screaming)
[02:14:14.581 --> 02:14:16.819]  (growling)
[02:14:16.819 --> 02:14:24.280]  Oh, no, no, I don't even know what this is.
[02:14:24.421 --> 02:14:25.062]  How did he get here?
[02:14:26.423 --> 02:14:28.505]  I just caught you, American!
[02:14:28.825 --> 02:14:30.907]  You visited Bandar Video!
[02:14:31.808 --> 02:14:35.070]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you!
[02:14:35.611 --> 02:14:41.176]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video, or I have to hurt you!
[02:14:42.977 --> 02:14:46.741]  Well, the white supremacist that reportedly attacked the subway yesterday...
[02:14:47.967 --> 02:14:50.610]  Frank James is in custody right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:51.090 --> 02:14:52.151]  No, he's actually black.
[02:14:53.012 --> 02:14:55.074]  But he's clearly mentally ill, just like Dylann Roof.
[02:14:55.094 --> 02:14:56.316]  We don't blame white people for that.
[02:14:56.356 --> 02:14:57.497]  We don't blame black people for that.
[02:14:58.158 --> 02:15:03.963]  It's a real tragedy, but I think with the temperature being turned up, we're going to see more of his insanity.
[02:15:04.004 --> 02:15:05.926]  There he is, being brought into custody.
[02:15:06.026 --> 02:15:10.871]  Ali Alexander, in closing, in the next five minutes, how do we avert the civil war they're trying to start?
[02:15:11.598 --> 02:15:18.267]  Yeah, so we do, we absolutely need to, I keep saying this at the end of every segment, we absolutely need to pray.
[02:15:18.427 --> 02:15:18.748]  Why?
[02:15:19.168 --> 02:15:20.430]  Because it shows our priorities.
[02:15:20.630 --> 02:15:26.258]  Oftentimes, you know, God's chosen people across several different covenants, so the Christians are no different.
[02:15:27.523 --> 02:15:28.523]  We pray last.
[02:15:29.304 --> 02:15:30.684]  And God wants us to pray first.
[02:15:31.545 --> 02:15:33.686]  And prayer is the most powerful weapon.
[02:15:34.226 --> 02:15:37.608]  And so when we use it last and then a miracle happens, we're like, well, how did that happen?
[02:15:37.628 --> 02:15:39.529]  Well, because we use the most powerful weapon last.
[02:15:39.849 --> 02:15:42.230]  So I would tell people that I think we need to pray.
[02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:44.531]  And I also think that we need a leader.
[02:15:44.851 --> 02:15:45.711]  And I don't know who that is.
[02:15:45.771 --> 02:15:46.612]  Maybe it's you, Alex.
[02:15:46.852 --> 02:15:47.852]  Maybe it's Donald Trump.
[02:15:48.133 --> 02:15:49.353]  Maybe it's General Flynn.
[02:15:49.713 --> 02:15:50.714]  But we need a leader.
[02:15:51.234 --> 02:15:54.573]  that calls us to prayer and repentance because...
[02:15:54.573 --> 02:15:56.113]  Alright, prayer needs to be first though.
[02:15:56.113 --> 02:15:57.514]  Yeah, it needs to be first.
[02:15:57.514 --> 02:16:02.814]   And you know, this is something that I do like about the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church
[02:16:02.814 --> 02:16:08.753]   is that we have to acknowledge that there are sins that God does assign to a community.
[02:16:08.813 --> 02:16:19.038]  That doesn't mean we need to believe in collectivism, but it means that we need to change our own lives, we need to make sacrifices, we need to abstain from certain things, so that we leave room for a miracle.
[02:16:19.259 --> 02:16:29.104]  And there's nothing wrong with saying, okay well I've been going on this sin for a while, and I've survived in times of prosperity, but now that wickedness is across the land, I need to abstain from that.
[02:16:29.984 --> 02:16:32.466]  God will, you know, admire your obedience.
[02:16:32.526 --> 02:16:34.148]  I don't want to say admire, reward your obedience.
[02:16:34.328 --> 02:16:35.209]  So first we need to pray.
[02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:38.152]  The second byproduct of prayer is that it makes us sane.
[02:16:38.632 --> 02:16:46.279]  So when we're getting this deluge of persecution, we're not saying at our gut primal level, we need to go bomb something, we need to go shoot something.
[02:16:46.679 --> 02:16:51.063]  It's, I will not give them an inch and become the monster that they want us to become.
[02:16:51.343 --> 02:16:53.505]  Now folks, I'm going to say something really crazy.
[02:16:54.346 --> 02:16:56.789]  I'm not going to deny that the people have the right of revolution.
[02:16:56.849 --> 02:16:58.350]  I'm not going to deny 1776.
[02:16:58.891 --> 02:17:03.896]  And I'm not going to deny that there is a time for legitimate violence when there is legitimate tyranny.
[02:17:04.116 --> 02:17:09.482]  And by the way, the Declaration of Independence even outlines that we should- Says you're right in duty.
[02:17:09.822 --> 02:17:11.644]  We're just- but they are losing right now.
[02:17:11.684 --> 02:17:12.685]  We're winning politically.
[02:17:12.705 --> 02:17:15.608]  We don't want to do it yet, but you're not denying we have the right.
[02:17:15.968 --> 02:17:18.409]  Right, I'm saying it's not the time now.
[02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:19.370]  That's for sure.
[02:17:19.390 --> 02:17:20.751]  But it's definitely a card in our hand.
[02:17:20.771 --> 02:17:21.971]  We're allowed to play.
[02:17:22.091 --> 02:17:22.552]  Right, right.
[02:17:22.572 --> 02:17:25.013]  It's like when all else is lost, you gotta do it.
[02:17:25.053 --> 02:17:32.557]  Yeah, if they start ripping your children from your home and surgeries, like, you know, there is a time for legitimate- China killing everybody's dogs and cats?
[02:17:33.057 --> 02:17:34.038]  Yeah, isn't that crazy?
[02:17:34.178 --> 02:17:36.639]  And everybody knows what that time is.
[02:17:36.679 --> 02:17:42.843]  The point is, anybody trying to lure you into plots to kidnap governors, anybody wanting you to offensively attack, that's not what we do.
[02:17:43.163 --> 02:17:43.363]  Right.
[02:17:43.403 --> 02:17:53.173]  And a discerning mind and a mind in prayer wouldn't, frankly, just would not punch cops at the Capitol, would not kidnap governors, would not do anything.
[02:17:53.193 --> 02:17:54.714]  Well, you know it makes us look bad.
[02:17:54.854 --> 02:17:56.896]  Like, I mean, it's obviously not good anyway.
[02:17:56.936 --> 02:17:58.018]  And you won't be successful.
[02:17:58.258 --> 02:17:59.779]  Like, you know, and this is how we know.
[02:17:59.799 --> 02:18:02.942]  Not only do I not want to just randomly punch cops, it's dumb.
[02:18:03.743 --> 02:18:04.263]  It's very dumb.
[02:18:04.724 --> 02:18:05.064]  It's dumb.
[02:18:05.344 --> 02:18:06.485]  And it displeases God, I think.
[02:18:06.525 --> 02:18:13.129]  So, you know, um, but you know, I'll tell you these cops, they need to stop complying with COVID orders and lockdowns and stealing.
[02:18:13.189 --> 02:18:15.391]  Yeah, no, they're putting themselves in that position, but doesn't mean we got to.
[02:18:15.411 --> 02:18:15.931]  Yeah.
[02:18:15.951 --> 02:18:16.231]  All right.
[02:18:16.251 --> 02:18:17.272]  You're gonna do the war room, right?
[02:18:17.532 --> 02:18:18.593]  I'm going to do the war room, I guess.
[02:18:18.873 --> 02:18:19.534]  I'm excited.
[02:18:19.814 --> 02:18:21.075]  Kate Daly's about to take over.
[02:18:21.135 --> 02:18:22.235]  Infowars.com.
[02:18:22.616 --> 02:18:26.919]  Tomorrow's news today, our big mega sale, 75% off selling stuff at cost.
[02:18:27.399 --> 02:18:28.139]  It ends today.
[02:18:28.199 --> 02:18:29.420]  The t-shirts sell at cost.
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:30.161]  Blow it all out.
[02:18:30.181 --> 02:18:31.642]  It's going to continue until they're all sold out.
[02:18:32.042 --> 02:18:33.243]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:18:34.443 --> 02:18:35.024]  Or 888-253-3139.
[02:18:35.424 --> 02:18:39.086]  Ollie, what else are you going to be talking about in the War Room today?
[02:18:39.567 --> 02:18:42.068]  Well, you know, maybe I'll commiserate a little bit with Owen.
[02:18:42.088 --> 02:18:44.270]  I know that he's kind of tight-lipped on his case.
[02:18:44.370 --> 02:18:45.470]  Everybody pray for Owen.
[02:18:45.590 --> 02:18:48.832]  Owen did nothing but peacefully outside the Capitol with me, and they're trying to put him in jail.
[02:18:49.033 --> 02:18:52.194]  They're trying to use him as leverage against you and me, and it's just really, really sad.
[02:18:52.255 --> 02:18:55.997]  So, you know, we'll be talking about that, and I guess more of this Fed plot.
[02:18:57.130 --> 02:18:59.972]  Which is, you're like, everybody's like, we know we didn't attack the Capitol.
[02:19:00.012 --> 02:19:00.733]  We're sick of hearing it.
[02:19:01.013 --> 02:19:03.295]  They're betting everything on the midterms on this.
[02:19:03.715 --> 02:19:04.676]  What are they going to stage?
[02:19:04.716 --> 02:19:05.657]  Let's not be idiots.
[02:19:06.257 --> 02:19:09.420]  Obviously, this is their big move to outlaw their opposition.
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:09.960]  And 2024!
[02:19:11.221 --> 02:19:12.502]  And 2024, absolutely.
[02:19:13.283 --> 02:19:13.623]  All right.
[02:19:14.504 --> 02:19:15.485]  Kate Daly takes over.
[02:19:15.525 --> 02:19:16.606]  Thank you, Ali Alexander.
[02:19:16.626 --> 02:19:17.767]  We'll be right back.
[02:19:17.787 --> 02:19:18.167]  Stay with us.
[02:19:18.959 --> 02:19:20.720]  Hi there, I'm Kay Dally, your guest host.
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:23.742]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show and thanks, Alex.
[02:19:23.842 --> 02:19:26.983]  Good to be here with you and a lot of news to cover.
[02:19:27.664 --> 02:19:29.205]  Man, are we getting a barrage.
[02:19:29.925 --> 02:19:37.309]  I am marked safe today from the false flag madman Brooklyn attack.
[02:19:40.184 --> 02:19:44.087]  I also have so much to talk about with that, and I also have Disney.
[02:19:44.187 --> 02:19:45.428]  I want to talk about Ukraine.
[02:19:45.708 --> 02:19:48.571]  I want to talk about who they're going to for the information on Ukraine.
[02:19:48.911 --> 02:19:49.912]  Very, very important.
[02:19:50.252 --> 02:19:52.454]  A little bit about the AP.
[02:19:52.674 --> 02:19:55.836]  So much to talk about with you today, but I'm so glad to be here.
[02:19:55.896 --> 02:20:11.788]   I'm from katedallyradio.com, and let me just tell you, I'm especially marked safe from the very, very obvious attack You know, it's getting a little more obvious.
[02:20:11.988 --> 02:20:23.623]  I don't know whether it was the bag that was left at the scene with the BB gun pellets, the hatchet, the pepper spray, extra smoke bombs.
[02:20:24.624 --> 02:20:25.325]  That was interesting.
[02:20:25.505 --> 02:20:26.426]  I thought that was interesting.
[02:20:26.606 --> 02:20:28.108]  And then I thought it was...
[02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:31.332]  Really interesting because usually they don't leave that behind.
[02:20:32.793 --> 02:20:53.147]  But the credit card falling out of the wallet supposedly on his ass, the one that fell out so that they knew who to go to, it was just perfectly sandwiched between the Biden speech for ghost guns and then of course the rollout today of the TSA.
[02:20:55.293 --> 02:20:57.074]  Yeah, the total rollout.
[02:20:57.094 --> 02:20:59.756]  They had all ready to go, the TSA for subways.
[02:21:00.796 --> 02:21:03.178]  Yeah, I'm going to talk about that, Jim, that they've got.
[02:21:04.118 --> 02:21:06.560]  They got a lot that they already had kind of in the pocket.
[02:21:06.720 --> 02:21:09.582]  Kind of sounds familiar, like going back to the Patriot Act.
[02:21:09.642 --> 02:21:12.644]  But anyway, they had this thing all ready to go.
[02:21:12.864 --> 02:21:24.151]  And within 48 hours, we're sitting on, on what presumably after five years of not really having, four years, I'm sorry, not really having anything like this.
[02:21:24.804 --> 02:21:28.026]  Um, they're going for this sort of event.
[02:21:28.567 --> 02:21:29.948]  That was so interesting to me.
[02:21:30.128 --> 02:21:34.771]  And as I was watching the video within like two minutes, I was just, I don't know.
[02:21:34.851 --> 02:21:38.053]  It was, uh, it was surprising.
[02:21:38.633 --> 02:21:39.154]  Surprising.
[02:21:39.374 --> 02:21:41.095]  It's like hat tip CIA.
[02:21:41.375 --> 02:21:44.597]  Um, you're, you're really evil still, but yet so obvious.
[02:21:46.719 --> 02:21:46.899]  Yeah.
[02:21:47.415 --> 02:21:53.057]  Anyway, I was thinking about this and I was thinking about all the GoFundMe accounts that will crop up now.
[02:21:54.397 --> 02:22:00.499]  And you know, people need to get paid, but you really should demand that we get different people involved.
[02:22:01.139 --> 02:22:02.059]  Maybe, I don't know.
[02:22:02.079 --> 02:22:04.400]  The whole situation was very interesting.
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:20.147]   As I was watching this thing unfurl yesterday, I was watching the guy with the tourniquet that was very loosely From his jacket, the arm of his jacket very loosely tied around his pant leg.
[02:22:20.907 --> 02:22:25.851]  And I was looking at there was hardly anything under him, but he was on his phone.
[02:22:25.871 --> 02:22:27.913]  I would be on my phone.
[02:22:28.453 --> 02:22:33.738]  I mean, I, you know, instead of having this space, I would, I'd be on my phone.
[02:22:34.018 --> 02:22:35.980]  I think that would be the best way to handle it.
[02:22:36.220 --> 02:22:38.682]  And, you know, just to buy the time.
[02:22:40.177 --> 02:22:44.901]  And then there were two guys that were hobbling around and couldn't decide which leg.
[02:22:45.022 --> 02:22:45.322]  I don't know.
[02:22:45.382 --> 02:22:46.303]  It was kind of interesting.
[02:22:46.363 --> 02:22:47.344]  It was like, ooh, this leg?
[02:22:47.384 --> 02:22:47.744]  This leg?
[02:22:47.784 --> 02:22:48.245]  I'm not sure.
[02:22:48.565 --> 02:22:49.105]  Maybe I'll hobble.
[02:22:49.586 --> 02:22:50.587]  And so there was that.
[02:22:50.927 --> 02:22:59.915]  And they were walking in circles because I know when I'm scared, I usually shoot for like the stairs or to get out of a scene, but nobody was really getting out of the scene.
[02:23:01.016 --> 02:23:02.598]  They were just walking in circles.
[02:23:03.999 --> 02:23:05.420]  And then the cameras being off.
[02:23:05.500 --> 02:23:07.039]   That was Another one.
[02:23:07.219 --> 02:23:12.101]  I mean, so reminiscent of other things we've been involved in where the cameras just magically stopped working.
[02:23:12.221 --> 02:23:13.521]  It's very odd.
[02:23:13.721 --> 02:23:20.544]  And so all the people that were in frame stayed in frame, milling around, milling around.
[02:23:20.804 --> 02:23:26.106]  And the news yesterday said that people didn't have their shoes.
[02:23:26.166 --> 02:23:30.007]  They were suddenly, I guess, missing shoes.
[02:23:30.247 --> 02:23:32.728]  They were missing shoes and clothes were torn.
[02:23:32.828 --> 02:23:36.129]  Although I didn't see that in any of the videos, but they said that.
[02:23:36.564 --> 02:23:37.104]  They said that.
[02:23:37.685 --> 02:23:44.568]  And then they also said that they were just super glad that he left behind this whole bag of stuff, like the two canisters and the smoke grenades.
[02:23:44.648 --> 02:24:01.816]  And all I know is that if I'm, if I was a madman, um, I would probably do a smoke grenade and then I would go onto a subway and then I would probably go after the people because I would want to create a scene of chaos.
[02:24:03.385 --> 02:24:06.127]  Because, you know, that's usually what they do.
[02:24:06.427 --> 02:24:13.971]  Mad men, they usually will throw a smoke bomb first before they go after the people.
[02:24:14.992 --> 02:24:17.413]  You know, it's so commonplace.
[02:24:18.934 --> 02:24:31.141]  So I was reviewing this and I thought, wow, that's kind of crazy that they would do that and then leave behind the credit card and then, of course, the bag and then the Glock.
[02:24:32.395 --> 02:24:33.016]  I thought, wow.
[02:24:33.156 --> 02:24:36.579]  And so it was so quick that the FBI was able to find them.
[02:24:36.879 --> 02:24:38.500]  I mean, my gosh, it was like rapid speed.
[02:24:38.520 --> 02:24:39.581]  They were able to find this guy.
[02:24:40.302 --> 02:24:47.328]  And they were actually able to find out that, of course, because with the credit card, we got to know why he did it, who did it, why he did it.
[02:24:47.949 --> 02:24:53.854]  And so now we know that he is a, that he thinks America is racist.
[02:24:54.815 --> 02:25:00.430]   And that kind of fit perfectly into The narrative of what's going on today.
[02:25:00.530 --> 02:25:02.650]  So that was just so coincidental.
[02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:05.291]  If I was a coincidence theorist, I'd be like all over this.
[02:25:06.272 --> 02:25:15.835]  And then it was sandwiched so carefully between Biden's speech and between the rollout today.
[02:25:15.955 --> 02:25:17.415]  It was like within 48 hours.
[02:25:18.576 --> 02:25:19.116]  That's quick.
[02:25:20.216 --> 02:25:21.177]  Usually it takes like a week.
[02:25:22.337 --> 02:25:27.499]  But then the governor of New York was on camera saying, this has to end.
[02:25:29.013 --> 02:25:32.134]  Although we haven't had something like this for several years.
[02:25:32.174 --> 02:25:36.754]  The whole time Trump was in office, we didn't actually have anything like this, sort of.
[02:25:37.814 --> 02:25:37.955]  Yeah.
[02:25:38.475 --> 02:25:40.515]  Anyway, that was interesting too.
[02:25:40.675 --> 02:25:54.837]  And so I kind of thought, wow, that was... All I know is that if I'm a coincidence theorist, totally on board with this one, and realizing that, oh my gosh, this stuff just happens, like the credit card falling out of the wallet.
[02:25:54.897 --> 02:25:55.658]  I thought that was good.
[02:25:56.138 --> 02:25:56.578]  Interesting.
[02:25:56.678 --> 02:25:57.098]  I'm sorry.
[02:25:57.198 --> 02:25:57.558]  Interesting.
[02:25:57.578 --> 02:25:58.398]  I thought that was interesting.
[02:26:00.665 --> 02:26:11.289]  And then, of course, they said that they found that credit card and that they believed it to be the gunman, but then they did know when he got off and on.
[02:26:11.869 --> 02:26:16.891]  So that was, I was like, how did you know that if you didn't know who you were looking for?
[02:26:16.911 --> 02:26:19.732]  That was very interesting.
[02:26:20.638 --> 02:26:26.480]  And they said the motive was unknown, but then 24 hours later, it's not unknown because we know exactly why.
[02:26:26.500 --> 02:26:32.203]  I think when you arrest somebody, you know exactly why they did what they did, like pretty immediately.
[02:26:32.823 --> 02:26:35.944]  When you're interviewing them, they usually give up, like in TV.
[02:26:36.524 --> 02:26:38.925]  In TV, you get the motive so quick, so fast.
[02:26:40.486 --> 02:26:41.707]  Yeah.
[02:26:41.747 --> 02:26:45.608]  Within an hour, you know where the motive, you know where they did it, so it's kind of like TV.
[02:26:45.808 --> 02:26:48.649]  You know why they did it, when they did it, and so on.
[02:26:48.789 --> 02:26:50.090]  So that was, I thought, interesting.
[02:26:50.765 --> 02:27:03.294]  But I especially loved how quickly it happened after the Biden speech, because, I mean, if you're gonna talk about ghost guns, then you've got to have some sort of presentation happen, something to shore that up.
[02:27:03.394 --> 02:27:09.159]  Otherwise, it just seems sort of off-putting in the middle of the COVID and the Ukraine narrative and everything else.
[02:27:09.219 --> 02:27:11.240]  I mean, you've got to have something right there.
[02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:11.340]  Yeah.
[02:27:13.182 --> 02:27:14.663]  You know, it helps.
[02:27:14.883 --> 02:27:15.984]  I mean, it helps, does it not?
[02:27:16.884 --> 02:27:17.465]  I think it helps.
[02:27:18.763 --> 02:27:25.867]  So, I basically wanted to let you know that they are going to roll out, or they have rolled out, I guess they're just basically telling us now that they did roll it out.
[02:27:26.528 --> 02:27:27.208]  That's the story.
[02:27:27.268 --> 02:27:28.289]  They did roll it out.
[02:27:28.429 --> 02:27:28.689]  Got it.
[02:27:28.829 --> 02:27:35.933]  They did roll it out, and they're telling you that you don't have to go through a TSA check per se anymore.
[02:27:36.333 --> 02:27:37.614]  They already have a system.
[02:27:37.634 --> 02:27:39.495]  It's just already there.
[02:27:39.515 --> 02:27:41.456]  It's already there.
[02:27:41.816 --> 02:27:48.000]  You just walk through it, and it picks up whether or not you have anything, because it makes us safer, and I like that.
[02:27:48.559 --> 02:27:48.999]  I like safe.
[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:51.301]  And so I feel safer.
[02:27:51.341 --> 02:27:52.162]  I feel cuddly.
[02:27:52.202 --> 02:27:55.544]  I just, I always feel super safe with my government in control.
[02:27:56.225 --> 02:27:59.287]  And so they are telling you now that they've rolled this out.
[02:27:59.708 --> 02:28:02.710]  I guess there was a little slip of the tongue or there are rolling it out.
[02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:03.971]  They've had it ready for years.
[02:28:04.411 --> 02:28:15.580]  And that now when you board trains, right, to keep us safe, they are going to be, you're going to be walking through this apparatus for the TSA and NSA.
[02:28:17.521 --> 02:28:17.882]  All right.
[02:28:21.126 --> 02:28:24.368]  I just really hope that the CIA kind of ups their game.
[02:28:24.648 --> 02:28:28.552]  I mean, they're evil, but they're obvious.
[02:28:28.672 --> 02:28:29.372]  You got to give them that.
[02:28:29.432 --> 02:28:30.353]  They're obvious about it.
[02:28:30.633 --> 02:28:33.035]  And I don't know if they just think we're dumb.
[02:28:33.395 --> 02:28:33.736]  I don't know.
[02:28:33.896 --> 02:28:37.098]  I don't know if they just think they can just... I think they stopped trying.
[02:28:37.519 --> 02:28:37.919]  I really do.
[02:28:37.959 --> 02:28:39.821]  I think they just stopped trying to do anything.
[02:28:40.121 --> 02:28:42.122]  I was like, well, crisis actors are us.
[02:28:42.163 --> 02:28:46.106]  And then you've got, you know, they really do need to up their game just a little bit.
[02:28:46.766 --> 02:28:55.038]   I think it's getting a little more, you know, Um, for the, for the theorist that is the, you know, coincidence theorist.
[02:28:55.239 --> 02:28:56.561]  It's getting, it's anyway.
[02:28:57.250 --> 02:29:00.332]  I'm going to be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:00.412 --> 02:29:01.153]  I'm Kate Dally.
[02:29:01.173 --> 02:29:02.373]  I almost forgot who I was.
[02:29:02.854 --> 02:29:05.435]  And Ukraine, Disney, all of that is coming up.
[02:29:05.635 --> 02:29:06.376]  And the AP.
[02:29:06.476 --> 02:29:07.377]  Can't wait to get to that.
[02:29:07.617 --> 02:29:09.798]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:09.818 --> 02:29:10.339]  I'll be right back.
[02:29:10.359 --> 02:29:12.820]  Hi, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:14.281]  Kate Dally here with you.
[02:29:14.381 --> 02:29:15.842]  KateDallyRadio.com.
[02:29:16.002 --> 02:29:17.403]  And so glad to be with you today.
[02:29:17.423 --> 02:29:19.865]  I am going to be talking about a lot of things in this hour.
[02:29:20.445 --> 02:29:27.907]  I want to talk a little bit about a movie you may have watched about the topic of snakes a little bit.
[02:29:28.567 --> 02:29:30.507]  And I'll comment on that in just a moment.
[02:29:30.547 --> 02:29:48.091]  But I also wanted to mention, just as we're talking about this today, the New York City Mayor, Eric Adams, actually came out and said they're rolling out their new technology and periodic bag checks for future terrorist attacks, according to the mayor.
[02:29:49.276 --> 02:29:58.487]  He was on Morning Joe, that lovely show on MSNBC, on Wednesday with the previous day's terror attack on the city's subway system.
[02:30:00.529 --> 02:30:04.954]  And the mayor touched on the possibility of all this new technology on public transportation.
[02:30:06.015 --> 02:30:08.037]  Although, they already had it ready.
[02:30:09.258 --> 02:30:11.059]  He didn't really go into detail on that.
[02:30:11.960 --> 02:30:19.005]  He just said with the gun detection devices, oftentimes when people hear metal detectors, you know, they immediately think of the airport model.
[02:30:19.426 --> 02:30:21.667]  These are not the only models that are available.
[02:30:21.847 --> 02:30:26.551]  These new models that are being used at ballgames and parks and hospitals.
[02:30:26.691 --> 02:30:28.012]  Don't worry about it.
[02:30:28.772 --> 02:30:29.593]  No biggie.
[02:30:30.194 --> 02:30:30.674]  No biggie.
[02:30:30.994 --> 02:30:34.056]  You're walking through TSA checkpoints wherever you go.
[02:30:34.737 --> 02:30:36.478]  So, don't worry about it.
[02:30:36.798 --> 02:30:37.499]  It's not a big deal.
[02:30:38.206 --> 02:30:41.608]  He even said, you're just simply walking through a device.
[02:30:42.909 --> 02:30:43.550]  Oh, is that all?
[02:30:43.930 --> 02:30:44.330]  Okay.
[02:30:44.390 --> 02:30:54.097]  So when I go to the hospital or my mini mart or the grocery store, I'm just walking through a device that picks up on all my information and everything about me and looks under my clothes.
[02:30:54.117 --> 02:30:56.619]  I feel warm and fuzzy right now.
[02:30:56.679 --> 02:31:01.563]  I feel fantastic just thinking about it and I'm not creepy at all.
[02:31:01.723 --> 02:31:03.664]  But he just said, don't worry about it.
[02:31:03.744 --> 02:31:12.718]   We already got this covered and they're going to be making sure that they You know, take care of business in the future, and they just wanted you to know.
[02:31:13.338 --> 02:31:15.159]  So I feel great.
[02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:18.141]  They also said, you know, no one is safe.
[02:31:18.502 --> 02:31:20.023]  No one ever is safe.
[02:31:20.043 --> 02:31:22.524]  You're not safe from anything or anybody.
[02:31:23.185 --> 02:31:35.193]  And so between COVID, between the mask wearers, by the way, the 2022 mask wearers, seriously, super citizen, your work here is done.
[02:31:35.513 --> 02:31:35.793]  You're good.
[02:31:36.363 --> 02:31:38.844]  Mankind has been saved from your extra efforts.
[02:31:38.924 --> 02:31:39.624]  We appreciate you.
[02:31:40.604 --> 02:31:41.745]  Big heart emoji.
[02:31:42.105 --> 02:31:42.505]  Thank you.
[02:31:42.585 --> 02:31:43.245]  Big group hug.
[02:31:43.985 --> 02:31:44.625]  Stop wearing them.
[02:31:44.966 --> 02:31:45.306]  Thank you.
[02:31:46.086 --> 02:31:50.107]  Philly masked up and we know this and I don't know why.
[02:31:50.127 --> 02:31:58.669]  I don't know if they lost all their brain cells in Philly, but certainly they must have because they are continuously wearing the mask voluntarily.
[02:31:58.970 --> 02:32:01.530]  Even CDC isn't even telling them to do it.
[02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:02.311]  They're just doing it.
[02:32:02.451 --> 02:32:03.671]  So I like that.
[02:32:04.284 --> 02:32:13.953]  I mean, I like the super citizen, the over-exuberant citizen, the one that just loves to wear it.
[02:32:13.973 --> 02:32:14.354]  It's awesome.
[02:32:15.175 --> 02:32:19.078]  Anyway, and so we've got also the airports.
[02:32:19.138 --> 02:32:20.179]  I wanted to mention that too.
[02:32:21.080 --> 02:32:25.725]  The airports are going to be talking about, you know, they're obviously, two more weeks, slow the spread.
[02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:28.421]  I don't remember the last time we heard that.
[02:32:28.741 --> 02:32:29.501]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[02:32:29.541 --> 02:32:31.762]  We've been hearing that for two years.
[02:32:31.882 --> 02:32:35.243]  And so they want a couple more weeks.
[02:32:35.663 --> 02:32:36.784]  I don't know what they have planned.
[02:32:37.364 --> 02:32:39.345]  I know Washington DC is getting COVID.
[02:32:39.385 --> 02:32:40.745]  It's completely targeted.
[02:32:41.706 --> 02:32:43.906]  It's completely targeted to DC.
[02:32:44.827 --> 02:32:50.249]  And so everybody's falling ill with COVID, even though it's the sniffles, but they're falling ill with COVID.
[02:32:50.409 --> 02:32:51.589]  That's the story.
[02:32:52.009 --> 02:32:53.730]  And so the mask wearing is...
[02:32:57.478 --> 02:32:57.998]  Pre-emptive.
[02:32:58.438 --> 02:32:59.659]  Pre-emptive.
[02:33:00.239 --> 02:33:01.700]  And by the way, everybody has a collection.
[02:33:01.960 --> 02:33:02.500]  So why not?
[02:33:02.820 --> 02:33:03.700]  Why not join in the fun?
[02:33:04.901 --> 02:33:13.704]  And so as we watch cities tumble into this crazy, in this crazy Munchausen's by proxy by the government telling us we're ill and everyone going, I'm ill.
[02:33:13.824 --> 02:33:14.444]  I must be ill.
[02:33:14.504 --> 02:33:15.245]  I'm thinking I'm ill.
[02:33:15.325 --> 02:33:16.625]  I'm going to get ill any second.
[02:33:17.666 --> 02:33:18.886]  So this is the deal.
[02:33:19.446 --> 02:33:25.688]   If cities just refuse to wear it, if they just refuse to wear it, we can we could actually bypass all of this.
[02:33:25.688 --> 02:33:27.527]  And I just think that would be outstanding.
[02:33:27.527 --> 02:33:28.527]  Don't you?
[02:33:28.527 --> 02:33:32.768]   Just some common sense and some logic and throw away the little toxic shield on your
[02:33:32.768 --> 02:33:34.688]  face and just stop wearing it.
[02:33:34.688 --> 02:33:35.688]  There we go.
[02:33:35.688 --> 02:33:36.688]  All right.
[02:33:36.688 --> 02:33:43.887]   So I wanted to talk a little bit about something that you may have seen out there and that
[02:33:43.887 --> 02:33:48.686]  is that you may have seen a video talking about snake venom.
[02:33:48.737 --> 02:33:51.239]  And I think this is a very interesting theory.
[02:33:51.259 --> 02:33:58.446]  I think there's a lot of... Well, if you start to even Google this topic, you're going to find a lot of information on it.
[02:33:59.046 --> 02:34:11.656]  And so when my husband was ill, I did notice that we had been at an event and about six people in our small group at this event, speaking engagement, became very, very ill on the way home.
[02:34:12.337 --> 02:34:20.743]  And some of the sheriffs that were at this event that I was going to be interviewing after the event, they happened to be ill too when I went to contact them.
[02:34:21.124 --> 02:34:29.540]   And so I thought that that was kind of an interesting thing that my husband became violently ill on the way home from from this event.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.921]  And so that's when, about a week later, he ended up in the hospital.
[02:34:34.242 --> 02:34:35.742]  So, and everybody knows that story.
[02:34:35.762 --> 02:34:37.223]  I've gone over that story a couple times.
[02:34:37.383 --> 02:34:49.567]  But what was interesting about it was many in our group, it certainly seemed strange that as we were all leaving the event, that so many in our group became violently ill.
[02:34:50.350 --> 02:34:53.471]  So at that point I thought, is this something that could be targeted?
[02:34:53.611 --> 02:35:04.273]  But at the same time, just to kind of tell you where I'm at on this, I'm actually in the Dr. David Martin camp and the John Rappaport camp that they have not a shred of evidence that COVID even exists.
[02:35:04.413 --> 02:35:14.036]  That it's more or less a label that says, it's 98 symptoms with the 98th symptom being the fact that you don't know you have it.
[02:35:14.096 --> 02:35:19.397]  So that's very convenient and very widespread to cover a whole host of things, okay?
[02:35:20.319 --> 02:35:33.742]  So when it's that wide and everybody's car accident or cancer or everything that people die of is labeled as COVID, then you know you have a problem in society of a label disease.
[02:35:34.042 --> 02:35:34.302]  Okay?
[02:35:34.362 --> 02:35:34.782]  A label.
[02:35:34.842 --> 02:35:35.582]  It's just a label.
[02:35:36.362 --> 02:35:37.743]  And so I'm in that camp.
[02:35:38.363 --> 02:35:56.147]   But this would certainly, this theory of snake venom being very incidentally like the same exact symptoms of Of say, COVID-19, and then also the fact that it attacks the body in the same way.
[02:35:56.327 --> 02:35:57.869]  That's a really interesting thing.
[02:35:58.309 --> 02:36:00.671]  So one of the theories is that this is in the water.
[02:36:01.452 --> 02:36:13.443]  Now, I don't think globally you could pull that off, but I know Dr. Brian Artis has a video on this, and he's been talking about this, and I do think this is a very intriguing theory to think about.
[02:36:14.167 --> 02:36:33.371]  But here in the United States, where we obviously had more cases, is this obviously, and whether we were just pulling like crazy from all the other things that were going on to label it COVID, or whether there was actually something going on, well, USA was different than the other countries.
[02:36:33.751 --> 02:36:40.252]  So that leads me to believe that possibly, could they do something to the water supply?
[02:36:41.033 --> 02:36:42.875]  What would you test in the water?
[02:36:42.955 --> 02:36:53.206]  And these will be some questions that we'll be asking Dr. Artis in the future and talking about this because I do think what he has to say is pretty intriguing.
[02:36:53.947 --> 02:37:02.917]  That there's an enzyme and that it's actually very important, very beneficial, critical for the immune system to function and that it makes sense why it'd be elevated in chronic illness.
[02:37:04.121 --> 02:37:14.428]  That the expression of this enzyme when a patient starts to suffer a cytokine storm, this is very much like how the venom would act in the body.
[02:37:14.528 --> 02:37:17.450]  And so, I know a lot of people are talking about this.
[02:37:17.490 --> 02:37:20.432]  A lot of people have questions about this.
[02:37:20.992 --> 02:37:25.075]  And so, we'll have to explore a little bit more into this and talk about this.
[02:37:25.529 --> 02:37:38.052]  Because there are so many different theories on COVID-19, but just like the gunman with the smoke bomb and then goes to shoot people like, you know, most gunmen do, what is the smoke bomb for COVID-19?
[02:37:38.772 --> 02:37:46.895]  What was the design of confusion around COVID-19 and what are the real underlining factors?
[02:37:46.935 --> 02:37:47.655]  I'll be right back.
[02:37:47.715 --> 02:37:51.416]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host, and you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:51.436 --> 02:37:51.996]  I'll be right back.
[02:37:53.064 --> 02:37:53.664]  Welcome back.
[02:37:53.724 --> 02:37:54.825]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[02:37:54.865 --> 02:37:55.905]  Glad to be with you today.
[02:37:55.925 --> 02:37:58.166]  I hope you're having a good day today.
[02:37:58.426 --> 02:38:00.167]  So I was mentioning the water.
[02:38:00.607 --> 02:38:08.791]  I know this is a hot topic this week and I know that I was mentioning the water because could you do something to the water in our country?
[02:38:09.798 --> 02:38:11.239]  Probably, I would imagine.
[02:38:11.739 --> 02:38:15.300]  And we'll have to ask more questions about that.
[02:38:15.780 --> 02:38:23.423]  Could you do something under the guise of say, we're here to clean the water with COVID stuff.
[02:38:23.483 --> 02:38:31.746]  This will help, because I know that they had cleaning agents and all kinds of things with the water supply.
[02:38:32.066 --> 02:38:34.127]  And could those things actually be harmful?
[02:38:34.367 --> 02:38:36.088]  That's a good question to ask for sure.
[02:38:36.858 --> 02:38:50.085]  And I think what's interesting about this whole case scenario that everyone's talking about, I'm talking about Watch the Water, it's a new documentary put out by a theory from Dr. Brian Artis.
[02:38:50.165 --> 02:38:56.188]  And I always appreciate people that will think and will really critically think about these types of things.
[02:38:57.819 --> 02:39:10.947]  When I was thinking about this as well, there were a lot of articles about snake venom being used in studies and Moderna especially utilizing these things as well.
[02:39:11.147 --> 02:39:13.208]  And so there are so many articles about it.
[02:39:13.308 --> 02:39:18.532]  It's almost right there in plain sight for a long time, which is kind of interesting.
[02:39:19.651 --> 02:39:25.933]  So you take that piece in and you also think about remdesivir, which I've talked, been so vocal about.
[02:39:26.133 --> 02:39:28.654]  Obviously remdesivir, it's like taking poison.
[02:39:28.994 --> 02:39:35.396]  It has a huge death rate and they have decided that it's the medicine with a high death rate.
[02:39:35.456 --> 02:39:46.879]  We're going in and we're declaring it the medicine of the universe, which is really sad and evil because we know the damage it can do, but the damage is getting blamed on COVID and not remdesivir.
[02:39:47.791 --> 02:39:55.159]  Well, if I were you, I would probably refuse remdesivir at all costs, and make sure that that stuff never touches your body.
[02:39:55.179 --> 02:39:58.022]  Because it is, it's kind of like a poison.
[02:39:59.358 --> 02:40:05.704]  Remdesivir makes you bleed internally and then you don't clot exactly like King Cobra venom does.
[02:40:06.045 --> 02:40:07.426]  So that's very, very interesting.
[02:40:07.766 --> 02:40:13.352]  There was a study completed like venom coursing through the body by Rosemary Brand.
[02:40:13.492 --> 02:40:22.741]  And so there are similarities to things with COVID that they are accusing COVID of doing, Remdesivir of doing, the shots of doing.
[02:40:23.462 --> 02:40:29.009]  The drip system like we've been talking about with the shots that ruin your immune system, right?
[02:40:29.590 --> 02:40:34.477]  But instead of being a viral respiratory thing, is this actually poisoning?
[02:40:34.797 --> 02:40:37.721]  Are we actually trying to survive poisoning?
[02:40:38.339 --> 02:40:39.739]  It's a really interesting theory.
[02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:49.082]  That's why I always appreciate people that will put out theories so that we can all take in the pieces, think about these pieces, and how they fit into our own lives, what we've noticed.
[02:40:49.202 --> 02:40:50.783]  All of you guys have noticed things, right?
[02:40:50.963 --> 02:40:51.963]  You've all noticed things.
[02:40:52.103 --> 02:40:54.184]  I noticed the high death rate at the ICUs.
[02:40:54.624 --> 02:40:57.085]  I've marked myself safe from ICUs today.
[02:40:58.145 --> 02:41:07.448]  And also, I've noticed that there can be a lot of different things that could lead us in a lot of different directions.
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:08.840]  That I get.
[02:41:09.581 --> 02:41:15.324]  And maybe there are things hiding in plain sight that are the problem behind this.
[02:41:15.784 --> 02:41:22.748]  Maybe it is just a label, like Dr. David Martin says and John Rappaport, because there is no sequence of COVID.
[02:41:22.908 --> 02:41:24.309]  There's no sequence of COVID.
[02:41:24.909 --> 02:41:40.006]   So if you're really going to look at this, are you going to say that maybe, maybe, that you label an illness and then while you're busy targeting certain groups Certain events, maybe certain things, right?
[02:41:40.046 --> 02:41:46.089]  Certain target groups with something else besides what they're labeling as COVID.
[02:41:46.529 --> 02:41:49.331]  It could be very confusing, like the guy with the smoke bomb, right?
[02:41:50.246 --> 02:41:55.592]  Usually a madman that wants to kill people isn't going to use a smoke bomb first.
[02:41:55.812 --> 02:41:56.032]  Why?
[02:41:56.252 --> 02:41:57.734]  Why would you do that?
[02:41:58.174 --> 02:42:04.621]  Unless you just want to cause so much confusion that nobody knows what's happening and nobody can really identify who's really there.
[02:42:04.961 --> 02:42:05.261]  Okay?
[02:42:05.842 --> 02:42:07.203]  So they do this with illness.
[02:42:07.263 --> 02:42:08.264]  They do this with COVID.
[02:42:08.284 --> 02:42:11.467]  They do this with a lot of the narratives and false flags.
[02:42:12.328 --> 02:42:19.476]   So as we're As we're going through the pieces of this, I always keep in mind, I'm always open to everything.
[02:42:19.916 --> 02:42:25.221]  Then you take in the pieces and you go, okay, what about this makes sense and what about this doesn't make sense?
[02:42:25.942 --> 02:42:27.383]  How do I remedy all of this?
[02:42:28.624 --> 02:42:32.668]  But I do think some of the pieces of this are kind of mind-blowing, right?
[02:42:33.148 --> 02:42:40.375]  Hydroxychloroquine and all the things we've been told not to take, the things we've been told not to take.
[02:42:41.335 --> 02:42:45.174]  are really sort of the anti-venom, aren't they?
[02:42:45.174 --> 02:42:48.335]  To this, they are the anti-venom.
[02:42:48.335 --> 02:42:50.174]  And so that's very, very interesting.
[02:42:50.174 --> 02:42:57.875]   I hadn't really thought about snakes before all of this because it just wasn't on the radar at all.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:42:58.580]  Was it for you?
[02:42:58.740 --> 02:43:00.961]  I don't think it was for anyone.
[02:43:01.502 --> 02:43:12.107]  And so to put these pieces together, then go back and start Googling this information, and there's so much on it in the media that really, it wasn't like they were shouting from the rooftops in the media.
[02:43:12.407 --> 02:43:15.209]  They were more or less doing some articles about it.
[02:43:15.229 --> 02:43:34.633]   I don't think people were thinking twice about it because everything we get, right, seems to come from some sort of Animal, coincidentally, a bat, a bird, the bird flu, you know, everything's always coming from some obscure thing rather than naturally with natural illness, right?
[02:43:34.673 --> 02:43:49.761]  It's always coming from some sort of animal, which is really kind of strange because, well, I could go into a whole thing about all the different countries and diseases or illnesses and bird flu specifically designated for certain countries, which has never made sense.
[02:43:50.041 --> 02:43:51.962]  I've talked a little bit about that on the show before.
[02:43:53.815 --> 02:43:57.478]  That a disease would know to stay in the guidelines or the boundaries of a certain country.
[02:43:58.599 --> 02:43:59.640]  Doesn't make sense, does it?
[02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:00.281]  Okay.
[02:44:00.801 --> 02:44:13.011]  So putting these pieces together, hydroxychloroquine, venom, all of these things, we know what works and we know about natural immunity.
[02:44:13.432 --> 02:44:18.316]  So there's lots of questions about, well, then how does natural immunity work with this theory too?
[02:44:19.165 --> 02:44:23.466]  And also, I think people are or could be very nervous about the water supply.
[02:44:23.486 --> 02:44:26.887]  I don't put anything past the deep state, ever.
[02:44:27.827 --> 02:44:30.128]  I think these people are atheists.
[02:44:30.568 --> 02:44:38.250]  I think they are hell-bent on making sure that we aren't around or that we are the peasants of society.
[02:44:38.810 --> 02:44:40.751]  So they have no regard for us.
[02:44:41.391 --> 02:44:48.113]  And so that's why I'm very, very open to... And I'm probably not very surprised by anything they could pull off.
[02:44:48.962 --> 02:44:50.984]  Look at what they're doing with Disney.
[02:44:51.464 --> 02:44:52.946]  Look at what they're doing with the youth.
[02:44:53.926 --> 02:45:00.032]  You know, look at what they're doing with child's rights and the right of a child to learn about sexuality.
[02:45:00.052 --> 02:45:14.905]  Well, the most obvious thing about the whole Disney situation and how they're changing our culture is why are teachers in Florida hell-bent and mad that they can't teach kindergartners about sexuality if they were just denying the fact that they were just doing it?
[02:45:15.928 --> 02:45:21.494]  If they weren't doing it, as they say they weren't doing that, then why are they fighting for the right to do it?
[02:45:21.694 --> 02:45:21.914]  See?
[02:45:22.094 --> 02:45:23.055]  None of it makes sense.
[02:45:24.096 --> 02:45:38.131]  And really what they're gaming for in this is to make it okay for children to have rights, for children to have the ability to decide for themselves even though they're a child, which basically cuts the parent out of it.
[02:45:38.897 --> 02:45:43.081]  And puts the government in and media in to be the parent.
[02:45:43.582 --> 02:45:47.806]  So that way the child gets to do what the child wants when the child wants to.
[02:45:49.007 --> 02:45:49.748]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:45:49.968 --> 02:45:57.435]  So I just want to do a big whole shout out for my parents because my parents did not throw me on puberty blockers when I went through my tomboy stage.
[02:45:57.915 --> 02:45:58.256]  Thanks.
[02:45:59.591 --> 02:46:06.274]  Um, so we have a whole society now that's saying, well my kid thinks he's this, and my kid thinks he's that, so that's what they are.
[02:46:06.655 --> 02:46:09.316]  And I'm going to allow them to be that, so I'm the good parent.
[02:46:09.336 --> 02:46:11.237]  Pat myself on the back for being amazing today.
[02:46:12.297 --> 02:46:15.659]  Instead of being a parent that recognizes children have imaginations.
[02:46:16.431 --> 02:46:33.604]  But what we're really doing behind that story, and behind Disney, and the fallout with Disney, Disney's going down the tubes fast, Disney saying, we love the transgender community, we love the LGBT community, we're all about that, and every show will have 50% of everything.
[02:46:34.084 --> 02:46:41.150]  Now, from now on out, we're really going to give your kids sexual information and sexual identity problems.
[02:46:41.676 --> 02:46:46.299]  And so the reason they're doing that, though, is to give children's rights, right?
[02:46:46.339 --> 02:46:56.807]  The children need their rights as a child to separate themselves away then from the parent who has control over them until they're 18, and responsibility for them and accountability.
[02:46:57.267 --> 02:47:01.671]  That's really what they're after in doing the whole Disney thing with Florida and everything else.
[02:47:01.791 --> 02:47:15.358]   And I'm glad that DeSantis is standing up for children, actual kids, not being, you Not being indoctrinated into questioning their sexuality in kindergarten.
[02:47:15.759 --> 02:47:16.579]  Can you even imagine?
[02:47:16.840 --> 02:47:18.401]  We never had to go through this, did we?
[02:47:19.282 --> 02:47:26.468]  I now look back on my years in the education system and thank you, thank you for never having to discuss this 24-7, right?
[02:47:27.308 --> 02:47:29.150]  I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:29.170 --> 02:47:31.712]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:47:31.732 --> 02:47:32.253]  Be right back.
[02:47:33.812 --> 02:47:35.353]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:35.373 --> 02:47:37.433]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[02:47:37.733 --> 02:47:39.654]  And you can go to katedallyradio.com.
[02:47:39.694 --> 02:47:47.657]  I do a live show every day and it's a lot of fun and it's very interesting to be on this end of things and watching the news daily.
[02:47:47.677 --> 02:47:56.520]   I mean, I immerse myself probably, I know it's awful, but 12, 15 hours a day into this, probably like Alex does as well.
[02:47:56.660 --> 02:47:59.381]  I mean, this is something that we kind of swim in.
[02:47:59.561 --> 02:48:03.863]  And so it's fun and interesting and excruciating at times.
[02:48:04.123 --> 02:48:15.867]  And also, it is, I have to say, it's kind of mind blowing to go to the backstory of just about everything and kind of figure out why our country has, what has happened to our country?
[02:48:16.507 --> 02:48:17.087]  Why are we here?
[02:48:17.147 --> 02:48:37.696]   What is going on with us and with what we've allowed all this Time in order to land in such a peculiar place where you could have a Biden speech on guns, a shooting within 24 hours and a TSA rollout for trains within another 24 hours.
[02:48:37.756 --> 02:48:39.137]  I mean, that's pretty crazy, right?
[02:48:39.197 --> 02:48:40.838]  It's like things are really speeding up.
[02:48:41.465 --> 02:48:49.492]  And they might be speeding up a little bit because the Democrats are afraid the Republicans are going to take the House and the Senate, which they probably are.
[02:48:49.612 --> 02:48:55.037]  But I don't know that it's going to do really much of anything because the Republicans don't say a thing.
[02:48:55.077 --> 02:48:56.858]  They don't say a thing about the election fraud.
[02:48:57.179 --> 02:49:00.001]  They don't say a thing about, well, let me put it this way.
[02:49:00.061 --> 02:49:04.865]  When the House and the Senate and the President all had control, we didn't do anything then anyway.
[02:49:05.966 --> 02:49:06.607]  So what does it matter?
[02:49:07.577 --> 02:49:09.498]  It's either a fast kill or a slow kill.
[02:49:09.578 --> 02:49:10.899]  That's basically how I look at it.
[02:49:11.079 --> 02:49:12.180]  And the parties are for us.
[02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:18.503]  The parties are for us to sit and argue over, while in Washington, it's just one big fat party.
[02:49:18.863 --> 02:49:25.267]  So, saying that, I just wanted to go back to something that the AP put out on themselves.
[02:49:26.027 --> 02:49:29.129]  Which, if you know me, I have such disdain.
[02:49:30.069 --> 02:49:32.791]  As much for the AP as I do the CIA and the FBI.
[02:49:33.826 --> 02:49:37.329]  And any intelligence group in America because they're screwing us over left and right.
[02:49:37.789 --> 02:49:48.458]  But the AP came about in the mid 1800s and they actually put this out and so I just wanted to make sure everyone realizes again in the news cycle that we get.
[02:49:48.498 --> 02:49:51.821]  We get our news from two sources, the AP and Reuters, okay?
[02:49:52.421 --> 02:49:56.745]  Both Rothschild owned, both very, very interesting entities.
[02:49:57.285 --> 02:50:03.190]  And so from the beginning, I just wanted you guys to know that the Associated Press is in charge of our elections.
[02:50:03.686 --> 02:50:04.986]  And most people don't realize that.
[02:50:05.686 --> 02:50:22.850]  Even from the Associated Press' website, the AP is the only organization that collects and verifies election results in every single city and county across the United States, including races for the President, the Senate, the House of Representatives, governors, and statewide offices.
[02:50:23.491 --> 02:50:24.771]  It's always the AP.
[02:50:25.802 --> 02:50:31.084]  And if you're wondering about that, why they never get mentioned in this, because we all know they put out crap news.
[02:50:31.544 --> 02:50:33.144]  The crap news goes as follows.
[02:50:33.424 --> 02:50:38.406]  Adjective, adjective, adjective, piece of news, adjective, adjective, adjective.
[02:50:38.426 --> 02:50:41.007]  And the reason they do this is because they want to frame the story.
[02:50:41.447 --> 02:50:45.408]  It's kind of like how, you know, like a lot of different tabloids write news.
[02:50:45.488 --> 02:50:46.328]  They have to frame it.
[02:50:46.408 --> 02:50:51.995]   Like yesterday, I was told that The dangerous madman, monster, blah.
[02:50:52.035 --> 02:50:57.739]  I mean, it's just, it's amazing how they frame the news instead of just giving you the news.
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:04.524]  Well, the explanation for why they are in charge of our elections is really quite interesting.
[02:51:05.365 --> 02:51:06.666]  This was a piece that was written.
[02:51:06.686 --> 02:51:10.969]  They said, journalists have continued that tradition for the past 172 years.
[02:51:11.549 --> 02:51:18.434]  So it shouldn't surprise anyone that the AP has control over the elections.
[02:51:19.114 --> 02:51:21.916]  Why does it get to make the call?
[02:51:22.276 --> 02:51:28.020]  Why does the AP get to collect the information and predict the winner and make the call?
[02:51:28.869 --> 02:51:36.211]  And the reasoning behind this was that, well, basically because they said no one ever stepped up to do it.
[02:51:36.231 --> 02:51:44.172]  Okay, so the AP decided they'd be the ones.
[02:51:44.192 --> 02:51:45.553]  Yeah, right there.
[02:51:45.613 --> 02:51:46.533]  They'd be the ones to do it.
[02:51:47.253 --> 02:51:54.338]   So the Federal Election Commission, which regulates some aspects of elections, Doesn't tabulate votes on a nationwide basis.
[02:51:54.478 --> 02:51:59.380]  That responsibility has become one of the unofficial duties of the media.
[02:51:59.400 --> 02:52:02.220]  I say it's the unofficial duty of the unofficial media.
[02:52:02.240 --> 02:52:03.441]  How about that?
[02:52:04.321 --> 02:52:26.470]   And so, as we kind of worship the AP, or journalists do, as the golden god of the media, and as they spin out the national narrative that gets sent to all the teleprompters for all the nice teeth, nice hair, little robots that sit and give you your news, those talented individuals Um, as they give you your news at night, what's interesting is all the scripts are the same, right?
[02:52:26.510 --> 02:52:27.110]  So we know this.
[02:52:27.371 --> 02:52:34.058]  You can listen to your local broadcast and their taint of the story matches up with your national broadcast.
[02:52:34.358 --> 02:52:35.159]  Everything's the same.
[02:52:35.319 --> 02:52:39.704]  Nobody has, no journalist has a different point of view or asked a question.
[02:52:39.764 --> 02:52:40.585]  It's all the same.
[02:52:41.590 --> 02:52:53.940]  And so the AP being in charge of our elections, it's just no wonder, when I look at how fraudulent they are, that they were just A-OK on making sure you got those results so fast.
[02:52:54.120 --> 02:52:56.182]  Remember when we all went to bed and all the numbers were changed?
[02:52:56.262 --> 02:52:56.622]  Like that.
[02:52:57.563 --> 02:53:02.687]  We all got the same, those results in the morning and all of the media was on board with the results.
[02:53:03.668 --> 02:53:05.629]  It's because the AP does that for you.
[02:53:05.950 --> 02:53:09.953]  Now, the AP does it in one evening because they don't want you to have to wait.
[02:53:10.916 --> 02:53:17.822]  They know that our society likes it and likes it best, so they're there to deliver, and deliver the goods.
[02:53:18.063 --> 02:53:24.048]  And so what they do is they call the election, and when they call it, basically people then step down, right?
[02:53:24.088 --> 02:53:27.972]  The opposing one, the loser, steps down and says, I guess I didn't win.
[02:53:29.213 --> 02:53:40.554]   And so, I say this because when you're looking at the Ukraine news, The Ukraine news is a whole different ball of wax because the Ukraine, well not a whole different ball of wax, I shouldn't say it like that.
[02:53:40.654 --> 02:53:50.282]  The AP news that covers, okay, and Reuters that cover the news in foreign lands are going to have all the same spin.
[02:53:50.482 --> 02:53:54.505]  They're going to tell you exactly what's going down, right?
[02:53:54.906 --> 02:53:55.566]  And what's happening.
[02:53:56.026 --> 02:53:58.969]  And they're going to do it in a way that they have to teach you how to feel about it.
[02:53:59.700 --> 02:54:04.962]  And when I was looking at CNN articles and Fox News articles that are very, well, they're very much the same.
[02:54:05.162 --> 02:54:10.285]  They just have either a conservative spin in the adjectives or a liberal spin in the adjectives.
[02:54:10.725 --> 02:54:13.846]  But it's interesting because they go to all the same people for comment.
[02:54:14.486 --> 02:54:16.567]  They go to all the same people for comment.
[02:54:17.648 --> 02:54:27.172]  And I find that interesting because we don't really realize, I think, how coordinated the effort is until you really start to try, you know, really start to look.
[02:54:27.893 --> 02:54:32.215]  Well, one of the gentlemen they go to is UNICEF's Manuel Fontaine.
[02:54:32.235 --> 02:54:35.457]  It almost sounds like a made-up name, but Manuel Fontaine!
[02:54:35.477 --> 02:54:51.664]  And Manuel Fontaine from UNICEF has been talking about children and has been talking about everything that's diabolical in the news, and they go to him for comment, and he has the same exact kinds of comments, we're all going to die, they're all going to die, from Ebola.
[02:54:53.183 --> 02:55:00.865]  And that was back in 2014 from Afghanistan, from the Nigerian crisis of 2016.
[02:55:03.066 --> 02:55:05.907]  You name it, he's got about the same types of comments.
[02:55:06.167 --> 02:55:16.690]  And so it's always that millions of children are about to die or have food insecurity and they're about to starve and we must go in and do something.
[02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:19.130]  But it's always the same.
[02:55:19.350 --> 02:55:21.091]  It's always the same kind of line.
[02:55:21.781 --> 02:55:23.523]  And so I find that kind of interesting.
[02:55:24.163 --> 02:55:29.329]  And they go to the same people, and one of them is the ambassador to the United Nations, Linda.
[02:55:30.250 --> 02:55:33.973]  So Trump fired her, and then Biden, of course, hired her back.
[02:55:34.574 --> 02:55:40.300]  And she is very interesting, Linda Thomas-Greenfield.
[02:55:40.640 --> 02:55:44.684]  She's very interesting, and she's always the one commenting on Ukraine.
[02:55:45.632 --> 02:55:47.073]  And I thought that was kind of strange.
[02:55:47.294 --> 02:55:50.136]  So they have the same kind of three people that they go to.
[02:55:50.196 --> 02:56:00.906]  The other gentleman that they go to was inserted by us in 2014 and worked for Zelensky and then, of course, got a medal at Christmastime.
[02:56:01.387 --> 02:56:11.975]   And when he got that medal at Christmastime, I think that's what kind of maybe got him on board to maybe be the spokesman for this Ukrainian-Russian Um, a thing that's going on over there.
[02:56:12.135 --> 02:56:15.896]  And so he is the spokesman for telling us what Russia's doing and what they're not doing.
[02:56:17.036 --> 02:56:22.698]  And the three of them are on comments for almost just about every single article you read.
[02:56:22.758 --> 02:56:28.120]  So always know who you're looking at as far as the comments and the comments section and so forth.
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:36.322]  The other thing that's cropped up is our legislators, our, our Congress people confirming the events of Ukraine.
[02:56:37.739 --> 02:56:39.380]  So I'm hearing this over and over again.
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:41.562]  Liz Cheney, ugh, Liz Cheney.
[02:56:42.142 --> 02:56:42.783]  She's so gross.
[02:56:43.183 --> 02:56:51.309]  Liz Cheney was confirming yet another event that happened in Ukraine yesterday and I thought that's really strange.
[02:56:51.490 --> 02:56:54.272]  Why are the Congress people doing this now?
[02:56:55.072 --> 02:56:56.694]  Is it because no one trusts the AP?
[02:56:59.756 --> 02:57:03.659]  You shouldn't trust the AP because they're opinionizing news.
[02:57:04.580 --> 02:57:11.182]  And so, and sometimes there's a grain of truth in there, but it's usually, it's there to propagandize to you.
[02:57:12.462 --> 02:57:19.344]  And knowing that they control elections should tell you a lot about the AP and why we get sold the box of rocks that we do.
[02:57:19.664 --> 02:57:24.866]  But why are Congress people coming out and telling us about things that are going on in Ukraine?
[02:57:24.986 --> 02:57:26.206]  It's very interesting, isn't it?
[02:57:26.306 --> 02:57:31.748]  They're a world away, but they seem to have all the knowledge in the world and all the goods on what's going on.
[02:57:32.515 --> 02:57:35.559]  And so I wanted to bring that to your attention because watch for it in the news.
[02:57:35.939 --> 02:57:39.504]  I've been seeing this happen and it's been quite astounding and alarming.
[02:57:40.245 --> 02:57:41.226]  Those are my pronouns.
[02:57:41.867 --> 02:57:44.150]  Alarming, astounded, horrified.
[02:57:44.470 --> 02:57:45.792]  Those are my pronouns for today.
[02:57:47.222 --> 02:57:48.142]  Good gravy.
[02:57:48.422 --> 02:57:49.983]  Anyway, all right.
[02:57:50.103 --> 02:57:51.163]  Thanks for listening in.
[02:57:51.223 --> 02:57:52.744]  I hope you're having a great Wednesday.
[02:57:52.804 --> 02:57:53.644]  Look at it this way.
[02:57:53.664 --> 02:57:59.566]  You've made it past the hump of the week, so it can only be good from here on out, right?
[02:57:59.987 --> 02:58:01.247]  Friday's a couple days away.
[02:58:01.287 --> 02:58:02.287]  This is fantastic.
[02:58:02.407 --> 02:58:03.128]  I'm Kate Daly.
[02:58:03.248 --> 02:58:04.108]  I'm Kate Dally.
[02:58:04.168 --> 02:58:05.689]  I even slaughtered my own name.
[02:58:05.688 --> 02:58:06.728]  I'm Kate Daly.
[02:58:06.728 --> 02:58:35.727]  [Music]
[02:58:35.727 --> 02:58:39.727]  Please remember the only way we stay on air is your support.
[02:58:39.727 --> 02:58:44.727]   And I am extremely excited that a product that I thought I might have to discontinue
[02:58:44.727 --> 02:58:47.727]   because of supply chain breakdowns, because we get it from France,
[02:58:47.727 --> 02:58:49.727]  through an American distributor, is available again.
[02:58:49.929 --> 02:58:53.529]   I put the money in 11 months ago to get this, almost demanded it back a few months ago,
[02:58:53.529 --> 02:58:56.449]   and they said, "No, France is opening back up, and the farm that makes it, you're going
[02:58:56.449 --> 02:58:57.449]  to get it."
[02:58:57.449 --> 02:58:59.408]  And they documented it over the last 100 years.
[02:58:59.408 --> 02:59:02.969]   It does better in a lot of different studies and tests than even over-the-counter antihistamines
[02:59:02.969 --> 02:59:03.969]  and things.
[02:59:03.969 --> 02:59:04.969]  It's all natural.
[02:59:04.969 --> 02:59:08.128]   It is the shells of a special type of quail, had a special diet where they learned it had
[02:59:08.128 --> 02:59:10.487]  a major anti-allergy effect.
[02:59:10.487 --> 02:59:12.328]  Helps support healthy sinus function.
[02:59:12.328 --> 02:59:13.808]  Helps enhance respiratory function.
[02:59:13.808 --> 02:59:14.808]  AlumBlock.
[02:59:14.808 --> 02:59:16.929]  Promotes clear airway passages in normal breathing.
[02:59:16.929 --> 02:59:18.728]  Promotes respiratory health and normal breathing.
[02:59:18.728 --> 02:59:20.689]  Supports eye comfort and sinus health.
[02:59:20.689 --> 02:59:21.689]  Quail egg extract.
[02:59:21.689 --> 02:59:25.529]   Decades ago, researchers in France discovered the ability for certain quail eggs to alleviate
[02:59:25.529 --> 02:59:27.529]  season-related symptoms when eaten.
[02:59:27.529 --> 02:59:28.529]  And it is powerful.
[02:59:28.529 --> 02:59:31.888]   And despite the fact it'll sell out before I ever get more of it in, I'm offering it
[02:59:31.888 --> 02:59:32.888]  out of the gates.
[02:59:33.111 --> 02:59:35.312]  40% off at InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:59:55.857 --> 02:59:56.857]  It is back in stock.
[02:59:56.997 --> 02:59:57.978]  It is 40% off.
[02:59:58.018 --> 03:00:02.337]   That sale is going to be ending on Monday or so, 'cause we've already sold out a lot of the stock.
[03:00:02.337 --> 03:00:06.058]   And we're trying to, again, reach our underages with things we don't have in stock anymore
[03:00:06.058 --> 03:00:09.117]  that people buy by selling out of the T-shirts.
[03:00:09.117 --> 03:00:14.497]   And we had 63,000 T-shirts over the last few years I ordered and bid and never promoted or sold.
[03:00:14.497 --> 03:00:16.778]  We had a lot of, some T-shirts sold well, some didn't.
[03:00:16.778 --> 03:00:18.298]  We had a lot of them just building up.
[03:00:18.298 --> 03:00:19.856]  Some of the best sellers are there as well.
[03:00:19.856 --> 03:00:21.817]  We're never gonna reprint any of these.
[03:00:21.166 --> 03:00:22.787]  We'll have all new shirts after this.
[03:00:22.867 --> 03:00:24.027]  And I appreciate everybody coming through.
[03:00:24.127 --> 03:00:26.408]  We've already sold out 20% of the stock.
[03:00:26.628 --> 03:00:29.089]  So in another week or two, we should sell out of all these t-shirts.

[03:00:30.370 --> 03:00:32.530]  We're selling them at cost at infowarestore.com.
