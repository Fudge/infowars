[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.590]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[00:00:01.671 --> 00:00:02.932]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:04.033]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[00:00:04.093 --> 00:00:05.434]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[00:00:05.454 --> 00:00:06.235]  And Joe Rogan?
[00:00:06.475 --> 00:00:06.955]  Elon Musk?
[00:00:07.116 --> 00:00:08.197]  You know where they tune in, right?
[00:00:08.257 --> 00:00:09.257]  I'll tell you right here.
[00:00:09.257 --> 00:00:12.957]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:12.957 --> 00:00:15.957]  Info Wars, tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:15.957 --> 00:00:23.057]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:23.057 --> 00:00:26.257]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say,
[00:00:26.257 --> 00:00:29.956]   I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight?
[00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.329]  You better believe you got one!
[00:00:32.548 --> 00:00:39.548]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.548 --> 00:00:49.548]  [MUSIC]
[00:00:49.548 --> 00:01:08.829]   The evidence of vaccine death and injuries is overwhelming to anyone
[00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.709]  capable of seeing past the mainstream media's hypnotic lies.
[00:01:13.709 --> 00:01:14.549]  (upbeat music)
[00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:18.930]  The numbers tell us that the vaccines have already caused a 20% increase in deaths.
[00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.553]  Now we have a run rate of about 20% excess mortality.
[00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:29.057]  That's confirmed by the CDC numbers, the funeral home numbers, and the insurance company numbers.
[00:01:29.117 --> 00:01:33.381]  And then somebody did an independent study I saw recently suggesting 20% is the number.
[00:01:33.701 --> 00:01:35.502]  So we're running at 20% excess deaths.
[00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:38.144]  And a 10% increase in disabilities.
[00:01:38.505 --> 00:01:39.586]  This is a stunning number.
[00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:45.971]  You're telling me that things have been flat for 5 years at 29 million and all of a sudden out of the data they get 3 million people are disabled?
[00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:47.012]  Out of nowhere?
[00:01:47.752 --> 00:01:51.557]  And now we are beginning to understand that this is just the beginning.
[00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:54.280]  Things are going to get much, much worse.
[00:01:55.001 --> 00:02:05.434]  Many of us have already seen the mysterious objects found in the vials of COVID vaccines by two separate independent groups using electron microscopy.
[00:02:06.235 --> 00:02:17.439]  We are also familiar with the rising number of strokes, heart attacks, and other side effects experienced worldwide after the biggest experimental vaccination in history.
[00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:22.261]  And now we are getting a first glimpse of what is causing all this.
[00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:28.462]  Something in the COVID vaccines seems to be growing within the recipient's vascular system.
[00:02:29.082 --> 00:02:35.444]  Anomalous objects are being discovered in the dead bodies of the vaccinated by embalmers and coroners.
[00:02:36.184 --> 00:02:40.465]  Horrific things being grown inside the veins and arteries.
[00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:46.166]  These are not blood clots, and they appear to be some sort of organic material.
[00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.636]  With small crystals and extremely thin wires made up of what looks like reptilian scales.
[00:02:55.498 --> 00:03:03.626]  This internal blockage growing within the vaccinated would certainly explain all of the deadly side effects we are seeing today.
[00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:09.953]  What the mainstream media is currently spinning as sudden adult death syndrome.
[00:03:11.764 --> 00:03:17.588]  We do not know what these things are, but they are being found by embalmers and coroners everywhere.
[00:03:18.328 --> 00:03:22.310]  Except, pretty much all of them are too afraid to speak out.
[00:03:23.031 --> 00:03:23.931]  Or they don't care.
[00:03:24.852 --> 00:03:28.494]  Only one has shown the courage to speak out so far.
[00:03:29.034 --> 00:03:30.675]  And this is the real tragedy.
[00:03:31.716 --> 00:03:34.697]  For those who remain silent, things will not get better.
[00:03:35.477 --> 00:03:42.379]  The FDA is poised to authorize these deadly vaccines to children as young as six months old.
[00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:44.880]  And humanity does nothing.
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.561]  Today, we want to provide an update on a topic that I know many parents and grandparents are focused on.
[00:03:51.202 --> 00:03:55.703]  The potential for the first COVID-19 vaccines for kids under five.
[00:03:56.783 --> 00:03:59.425]  We have waited a long time for this moment.
[00:03:59.846 --> 00:04:01.287]  Well, guys, here's some good news.
[00:04:01.347 --> 00:04:08.212]  The Biden administration has finally announced a vaccine rollout plan for children under five, and they've ordered 10 million doses.
[00:04:09.272 --> 00:04:09.713]  That's great.
[00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:16.037]  Right now, kids are like, oh, my gosh, we can finally meet up for drinks.
[00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.081]  Yep, as we speak, everyone in the lollipop industry is like, we're buying a yacht.
[00:04:21.141 --> 00:04:22.022]  Here we go.
[00:04:22.042 --> 00:04:22.882]  You get a lollipop.
[00:04:22.902 --> 00:04:23.323]  You get one.
[00:04:24.278 --> 00:04:28.339]  It's very exciting to hear a four-year-old scream, Facebook told me Bill Gates controls the vaccines.
[00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.580]  You okay?
[00:04:31.816 --> 00:04:37.780]  Why should we deserve anything other than pain and suffering if we do nothing to protect our own children?
[00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:46.246]  Once those afraid of speaking out begin seeing their coroner tables filled with dead children, it will be too late.
[00:04:46.747 --> 00:04:48.148]  But it's not too late now.
[00:04:48.808 --> 00:04:58.875]  If you are an embalmer, a coroner, or a funeral director, and you are seeing these things, there is still time to save the lives of our innocent children.
[00:04:59.756 --> 00:05:05.481]  You can start now by contacting Dr. Jane Ruby at protonmail.com.
[00:05:06.602 --> 00:05:33.002]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:33.038 --> 00:05:35.038]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:05:35.038 --> 00:05:44.278]  It's Monday, June 20th.
[00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:45.573]  The year is 2022.
[00:05:46.194 --> 00:05:48.416]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:05:48.436 --> 00:05:52.201]  I want to thank you all for joining us on this historic transmission.
[00:05:55.137 --> 00:06:02.920]  Russia has defaulted on its international debt and fired more missiles into Kiev while the G7 is meeting nearby in Europe.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:24.395]   Biden has cryptically said that new lockdowns are imminent and we see Los Angeles And Toronto and other globalist-controlled cities announcing that they may need new lockdowns and new restrictions on gatherings because of monkeypox.
[00:06:24.455 --> 00:06:26.057]  So, right on time.
[00:06:27.546 --> 00:06:40.536]  It's all beginning to unfold, and we have leaked documents out of Europe, the UK, the US, and Canada, as well as Australia, New Zealand, that they're planning new lockdowns in the fall.
[00:06:41.077 --> 00:06:45.060]  That doesn't mean they're going to do them, it means they're planning them and trying to get them ready.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.401]  It doesn't protect you, it destroys your immunity.
[00:06:47.962 --> 00:07:06.935]   These folks really, absolutely, want to Lock us down forever and make us slaves of the Great Reset with carbon lockdowns directed by our cell phones on when we're allowed to leave our house, what we're allowed to do, where we're allowed to go.
[00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:14.036]  Now I told you years ago they were going to use cell phones for this, because it's in the IMF and World Bank document plans.
[00:07:14.856 --> 00:07:15.957]  But now it's here.
[00:07:16.057 --> 00:07:23.878]  So for people to think, oh they backed off the vaccine passports, and oh they backed off the forced inoculation, and oh they backed off the, they didn't back off anything.
[00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:30.562]  And if you work at these hospitals, or you're in the military, or at many corporations, they make you take these shots.
[00:07:30.942 --> 00:07:33.863]  And now they're talking about three, quote, boosters a year.
[00:07:35.204 --> 00:07:37.625]  That does nothing but destroy your immune system.
[00:07:37.665 --> 00:07:40.727]  So, we're going to be getting to all of that coming up today.
[00:07:40.787 --> 00:07:44.608]  Biden, once again, claims another pandemic is on the way.
[00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:49.071]  Monkeypox spreading locally at large L.A.
[00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:50.111]  County events.
[00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:52.552]  Health officials say they need to stop those.
[00:07:52.632 --> 00:07:53.733]  That's how it begins.
[00:07:55.458 --> 00:08:11.770]  Meanwhile, major new study out documenting what we already know that the so-called COVID shots are gene therapies that cause all sorts of blood clots, cancer and destruction of your immune system and fertility.
[00:08:12.471 --> 00:08:14.192]  A lot of key news on that front.
[00:08:15.373 --> 00:08:18.436]  Obviously, we have the massive news and the fallout.
[00:08:19.121 --> 00:08:27.387]  From the Roe v. Wade decision, but there's been other big, very good decisions out of the Supreme Court as well that we'll be getting into.
[00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:29.529]  I mean, this is a no-brainer.
[00:08:29.549 --> 00:08:48.491]   You don't need a Supreme Court to tell you this, but for 30 years across the United States, in fact, right when I was leaving high school, 30-something years ago, they were telling people, don't say a prayer, and don't thank God, if you're the valedictorian or the salutatorian.
[00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:58.680]  They were telling coaches, don't say prayers, here in Austin, at the beginning of a game, even in a huddle with your team.
[00:09:00.662 --> 00:09:07.408]  And then you've seen coaches that have been fined, coaches that have been fired, in high school, because they say a prayer.
[00:09:09.793 --> 00:09:11.815]  Now, that's their right to say that.
[00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:15.878]  Separation of church and state means we don't have a state-run religion.
[00:09:16.678 --> 00:09:18.680]  Like the Democrats do, pedophilia and Satanism.
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:22.723]  They're trying to bring in, you know, corporate nihilistic evil.
[00:09:23.984 --> 00:09:26.887]  So they have their big global government religion of political correctness.
[00:09:27.347 --> 00:09:35.994]  But in America, you can be a Buddhist, you can be a Catholic, you can be a Christian, a Protestant, you can be an agnostic, you can be an atheist, you can be whatever you want.
[00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:45.034]  And you can hand out Christmas cards at school, and you can say a prayer at the lunch table if you want, and people are offended, they can move away.
[00:09:46.195 --> 00:09:48.576]  That's not state-run religion.
[00:09:51.378 --> 00:09:55.520]  The left's religion is political correctness and oppression of speech and control.
[00:09:58.482 --> 00:09:59.442]  Their religion is tyranny.
[00:10:01.544 --> 00:10:04.185]  Their religion is enslavement.
[00:10:06.266 --> 00:10:14.750]   But now, The Supreme Court has come out and said, no, people can pray on the football team.
[00:10:14.891 --> 00:10:17.272]  And if somebody wants to get them to say a prayer before the game, they can do it.
[00:10:17.753 --> 00:10:22.937]  That is up to those individuals and the people at that school and that school board and those parents.
[00:10:23.437 --> 00:10:39.654]   But because a few parents are offended by something going on, Doesn't mean everybody else that has to keep their mouths shut while the left parades half-naked children through the streets with naked men all over the United States this weekend.
[00:10:40.054 --> 00:10:47.859]  We have horrible footage from across the United States that we can't even show here because of obscenity laws.
[00:10:48.419 --> 00:10:50.501]  We're showing you the milder stuff and it is horrific.
[00:10:51.397 --> 00:11:15.132]  Naked women, naked men, people urinating on each other, eating poop off the ground, while the Boy Scouts of America march through the middle of it with their rainbow flags and men naked on bikes with their penises hanging out right in front of three-year-old babies with their mothers holding them out like they've just won the Olympics.
[00:11:17.125 --> 00:11:18.186]  They've just won a gold medal.
[00:11:18.726 --> 00:11:21.767]  That's all coming up today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:21.787 --> 00:11:29.771]  And remember, as shocking as this stuff is we're going to be showing you, it is only the milder garbage.
[00:11:31.152 --> 00:11:35.214]  So that's coming up in the last segment of this hour.
[00:11:35.234 --> 00:11:39.076]  It's a warning for those that don't want to be subjected to this, but we have to get it on record.
[00:11:39.676 --> 00:11:44.379]  Because our children are the ones being forcibly subjected to this in true pedophilic fashion.
[00:11:45.646 --> 00:11:52.540]  The ruination, the rape of these children's minds, these children's souls.
[00:11:53.722 --> 00:11:55.766]  We'll break it all down in the last segment of this hour.
[00:11:59.377 --> 00:12:02.919]  We also have John Henry West in the head of LiveSite News.
[00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:06.101]  It's tirelessly worked for the victories we're starting to have.
[00:12:06.561 --> 00:12:18.307]  He'll be joining us to lay out what he thinks has really unfolded and what's coming next and the next attacks the left is going to launch in their push to assure their access, their blood of the innocents.
[00:12:20.208 --> 00:12:21.969]  Let me keep telling you what else is coming up here today.
[00:12:23.445 --> 00:12:30.771]  When we come back, Democrats' response to abortion ruling sounds a lot like a real insurrection.
[00:12:32.332 --> 00:12:33.173]  But when they do it...
[00:12:34.445 --> 00:12:57.112]  And do it much more intensely, it's good, it's wonderful, and I've got CNN, MSNBC, all of them, Democrat leaders saying, there's going to be a revolution, we're putting on the armor, we're going to war, a whirlwind, you're going to pay, and they're at the Supreme Court, Justice's House is threatening them, and the media's like, this is mostly peaceful, this is good, taking over highways, attacking people.
[00:12:58.012 --> 00:13:04.060]  Doing all of this with these psycho leftists that want access to your children, period.
[00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:12.632]  The whole thing is an act of their dominance over the life processes of humans, over men and women and children.
[00:13:13.293 --> 00:13:14.535]  And remember this key point.
[00:13:15.623 --> 00:13:20.126]  I'm going to make this again in the last segment of this hour, but I'm going to do it in more detail.
[00:13:20.746 --> 00:13:44.969]   But if you take anything away from this, understand, when you see the evil in the streets and the naked men parading children as their captured spoils, as trophies, through the streets of San Francisco, through the streets of Seattle, through the streets of Dallas, through the streets of Austin, through the streets of Houston, through the streets of Miami, through the streets of New York and Toronto and London and Berlin.
[00:13:45.669 --> 00:13:46.850]  And all over the world this week.
[00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:49.951]  It's all directed by the big corporations.
[00:13:50.571 --> 00:13:58.013]  The uniforms, the outfits, the drag queen pedophile time, the parading of the children, the handing out of condoms to the Boy Scouts.
[00:13:58.773 --> 00:14:04.535]  All of it is directed to poison and bring down society as a weapon, and it's all on record.
[00:14:04.575 --> 00:14:05.115]  That's their plan.
[00:14:06.869 --> 00:14:15.553]  Going back to the 60s, it's in government documents and think tank documents we cover in Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, how this was all completely planned.
[00:14:17.293 --> 00:14:32.860]  And so that's all they're doing is parading captured children, like when the Romans would parade captured slaves from countries they'd conquered, they are parading their children, our children, in front of us.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:40.909]  That's what the Romans would do when they conquered an area, is they would come back with the spoils of thousands of captured women and children.
[00:14:40.929 --> 00:14:44.455]  They'd kill the men, celebrating the spoils of their victory.
[00:14:45.116 --> 00:14:46.698]  Pissing on the children, literally.
[00:14:47.953 --> 00:15:08.843]  Celebrating their victory over us, their act of dominance, their planting of the flag, and their announcement that we don't just own your body, we're going to forcibly inject you, we're not just going to lock you in your house, but we are going to take your children, if we can't kill them in the womb, and do medical experiments on them, we're going to ruin their souls and minds after, because we serve the devil.
[00:15:10.484 --> 00:15:12.325]  Saddam and Gomorrah ain't got nothing on these people.
[00:15:13.125 --> 00:15:24.615]   It's Monday, June 27th, 2022 I'm your host Alex Jones and Coming up at the end of the hour into the next hour.
[00:15:24.655 --> 00:15:52.679]   We're gonna go into the depths of hell In fact watching the crew review some of the footage and clips are getting ready reminded me of things I'd forgotten we have clip after clip after clip in Louisiana and Texas in New York in California and Kansas just everywhere men coming to City councils in their male attire and saying, I'm a drag queen.
[00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:55.560]  I dance at the local gay bar.
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.400]  That's where I work.
[00:15:57.201 --> 00:15:58.601]  I want access to your children.
[00:15:58.742 --> 00:16:00.062]  I will groom your children.
[00:16:00.622 --> 00:16:02.383]  I need access to them.
[00:16:03.324 --> 00:16:08.746]  And what's crazy is you see these clips from Florida and Texas and the one I was mentioning was Baton Rouge.
[00:16:10.327 --> 00:16:11.768]  They all say the same thing.
[00:16:12.268 --> 00:16:14.729]  I need access to the children.
[00:16:16.144 --> 00:16:25.167]  And if you study the criminology of pedophiles, they are unremorseful and say they've got to have it.
[00:16:27.707 --> 00:16:40.531]  Imagine you're 18, you got your male vigor going, and you just see really gorgeous women and you go ask them out and you want to date them because you have a huge attraction to them.
[00:16:41.909 --> 00:16:46.452]  But if they brush you off and stuff or whatever, you know not to push it because you can control your hormones.
[00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:51.135]  These are people that aren't going after folks that are of age that are adults.
[00:16:52.396 --> 00:16:54.337]  They're going after little 2, 3, 4, 5 year old children.
[00:16:56.124 --> 00:17:16.335]  That see adults as authority figures and their mothers are there saying, here, these are the good people, a bunch of them are convicted pedophiles and perverts, dancing around naked in the streets, doing things that we can't even show you, being cheered by crowds of people, marching the Boy Scouts of America through the middle of it.
[00:17:18.176 --> 00:17:21.298]  I mean, folks, this is perverts on parade.
[00:17:22.438 --> 00:17:24.820]  And the whole thing is pedophilic.
[00:17:25.777 --> 00:17:26.477]  On its face!
[00:17:27.638 --> 00:17:32.721]  I said I'd get to it at the end of the hour, into the next hour, because there's a lot of it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:33.601 --> 00:17:35.742]  And the new stuff is just unbelievable.
[00:17:36.743 --> 00:17:38.044]  But this has been going on a long time.
[00:17:40.325 --> 00:17:49.590]  But we're talking people eating feces off the ground, urinating in each other's mouths, having sex on the street.
[00:17:51.611 --> 00:17:52.852]  That footage is pouring out.
[00:17:53.846 --> 00:17:58.810]  of Seattle and San Francisco and Europe.
[00:17:59.551 --> 00:18:03.694]  And the media is freaking out that in Eastern Europe, they're arresting people that do this.
[00:18:04.135 --> 00:18:09.039]  You have sex in front of kids, you bring kids to one of these in Hungary?
[00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:10.320]  They arrest your ass.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.321]  And they should.
[00:18:13.322 --> 00:18:13.863]  Think about this.
[00:18:13.883 --> 00:18:14.964]  I'm gonna start getting into this right now.
[00:18:15.024 --> 00:18:16.165]  Then I'll hit abortion next segment.
[00:18:16.365 --> 00:18:17.066]  It's all intertwined.
[00:18:19.027 --> 00:18:30.643]   Imagine if you went to the local park, And there was a mother and father standing there naked, and they had a couple of their children with them, who were scantily clad, and the children were twerking in front of the adults.
[00:18:30.663 --> 00:18:31.904]  You'd think, man, I'm calling the police.
[00:18:32.324 --> 00:18:35.067]  This is some kind of weird, crazy, pervert deal.
[00:18:38.770 --> 00:18:44.635]  And the police would come, and they would arrest them for indecency with a child.
[00:18:48.587 --> 00:18:51.408]  And if the parents were involved, CPS would come, and they should.
[00:18:52.068 --> 00:19:30.775]   But when it's parents bringing their children to events to have them be part of this, it's praised by these jurisdictions and protected and taking children to not just Homosexual bars taking them to bars that are sex clubs where people have naked dancing and they've got big signs on the walls saying it ain't gonna lick itself and and then pornographic posters up that we can't even show you we have the footage inside the Dallas place where they were parading kids as young as three given putting money in in men's g-strings and it's
[00:19:33.303 --> 00:19:34.984]  Unbelievably brutal stuff, folks.
[00:19:35.664 --> 00:19:37.365]  It's a very destructive lifestyle.
[00:19:37.986 --> 00:19:42.508]  And these folks have chewed through themselves and absolutely drug themselves out of their minds.
[00:19:42.888 --> 00:19:49.952]  And the final thing, the final evil thing to do, the final thing that will help them get their kicks is destroy your children's innocence.
[00:19:50.573 --> 00:19:51.913]  The whole thing is 100% vampiric.
[00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:56.732]  100% vampiric.
[00:19:56.732 --> 00:20:03.432]  100% vampiric.
[00:20:03.432 --> 00:20:11.052]   And I have clip after clip after clip we're gonna play of them saying, "I need access to your children."
[00:20:11.173 --> 00:20:24.620]  And every time they come out of the woodwork, they come to city council or the school board and they say, we're not allowed to come to the elementary school on career day and teach your children about the great careers we've got up at the local gay bar where we dance.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:25.580]  It's beautiful art.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:27.501]  We want to teach your children this art.
[00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:30.682]  And we want to groom them for the next generation.
[00:20:30.762 --> 00:20:31.903]  These are exact quotes.
[00:20:33.171 --> 00:20:43.496]  Countless videos of men in giant, dressed up like nuns, with clown makeup on their faces saying, we are going to get your children, you will not stop us, we are taking them over.
[00:20:44.317 --> 00:20:45.698]  And then the San Francisco Choir!
[00:20:47.519 --> 00:20:53.702]  The official gay choir that gets almost the same funding as the main choir of the city.
[00:20:56.286 --> 00:20:58.229]  Says, we're going to get your children.
[00:20:58.489 --> 00:20:59.911]  Your children belong to us.
[00:21:00.031 --> 00:21:03.596]  We're going to groom them, we're going to take them, and then we're going to get you.
[00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:08.443]  And you look at them, if you were trying to hire somebody.
[00:21:10.953 --> 00:21:18.275]  To be around your children, you take one look at every one of these men, and you would say, those guys are perverts.
[00:21:18.915 --> 00:21:20.276]  Those guys are fruits.
[00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:23.837]  Not just because they like the same sex, no.
[00:21:24.297 --> 00:21:30.539]  It's because they want access to children, and they look like who you'd hire for a Hollywood production.
[00:21:30.819 --> 00:21:39.862]  If you were going to make a movie about a cult of pedophiles, there's a thousand strong that goes around kidnapping kids, and you had their underground meeting, it would look like these people.
[00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:42.183]  This is what it looks like.
[00:21:42.523 --> 00:21:43.183]  This is it.
[00:21:43.483 --> 00:21:48.825]  This is grown men dressed up in clown outfits with their children being brought to them.
[00:21:48.845 --> 00:21:53.967]  And many of the people we've been showing on screen later get arrested.
[00:21:55.968 --> 00:22:02.190]  Because they already have prior convictions for assaulting children.
[00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:06.372]  And yeah, the local newscast in Houston were like, well, gotta get them while they're young.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.221]  And then Desmond is amazing.
[00:22:12.262 --> 00:22:16.507]  They parade him around with convicted chainsaw murderers.
[00:22:17.148 --> 00:22:19.350]  One guy killed his boyfriend with a chainsaw.
[00:22:22.433 --> 00:22:25.036]  He's a famous, he's dead now, advocate for pedophilia.
[00:22:26.363 --> 00:22:29.945]  He himself was a club boy when he was like 12 and 13 in the gay bars.
[00:22:30.226 --> 00:22:31.326]  Yeah, there he is right there.
[00:22:31.867 --> 00:22:33.748]  He died of a drug overdose last year.
[00:22:34.127 --> 00:22:41.426]   And they've got Desmond is Amazing, this little boy being paraded around talking about sex and taking ketamine with
[00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:42.127]  these guys.
[00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:52.627]   And they get up to kindergartners and say, "Let me show you how to shake your ass."
[00:22:53.462 --> 00:22:54.662]  And that's at the library.
[00:22:54.702 --> 00:22:56.063]  That's on the Associated Press.
[00:22:56.443 --> 00:22:58.024]  That's them saying it's a good thing.
[00:22:58.244 --> 00:23:01.105]  And people were asking me, you know, 10 years ago, Jones, why are you so upset about this?
[00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:04.546]  I said, folks, this is the globalist takeover arm.
[00:23:06.146 --> 00:23:22.132]  If you can have a big, disgusting fat man in a clown outfit, that's obviously scary as hell, and make kids go sit in their lap, and the kids always look scared, and the mothers make them go sit in their lap, it's a big, giant, evil, sick exercise of dominance and control.
[00:23:23.292 --> 00:23:24.573]  Of bondage.
[00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:32.118]  This is children being put into sexual bondage, and their innocence being destroyed, and it is a curse on our nation if it's allowed to continue.
[00:23:32.438 --> 00:23:34.079]  The devil knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:23:34.259 --> 00:23:38.021]  This is an affront to God, and if it's allowed to continue, we will be destroyed.
[00:23:38.902 --> 00:23:42.444]  Well, if you believe the BBC and ABC News, which...
[00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:46.973]  They lie so much it's hardly anything they say, but it might have happened.
[00:23:47.193 --> 00:23:49.335]  We'll try to talk to independent reporters over there.
[00:23:49.955 --> 00:23:54.659]  Putin just fired missiles at a shopping mall in Kiev, blowing it to bits.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:58.443]  It's a giant smoking crater still on fire.
[00:23:58.463 --> 00:24:02.886]  And that's a little message to the G7 that's meeting nearby.
[00:24:04.968 --> 00:24:08.671]  We'll be getting into all of that coming up in the third hour today.
[00:24:09.071 --> 00:24:18.241]   Speaking of the economy, Democrat response to abortion ruling sounds a lot like a call for insurrection.
[00:24:19.082 --> 00:24:21.325]  We're seeing violence and attacks all over the country.
[00:24:22.206 --> 00:24:26.733]  I have clips here of MSNBC, NBC, you name it.
[00:24:28.004 --> 00:24:32.347]  Saying that this is going to spark a civil war in America.
[00:24:32.687 --> 00:24:34.508]  And that there's violence in the ruling.
[00:24:34.548 --> 00:24:38.471]  That Republicans are violent by not letting people kill babies.
[00:24:38.511 --> 00:24:39.952]  Talk about upside down world.
[00:24:40.352 --> 00:24:41.293]  Talk about doublespeak.
[00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:50.739]  We've got a big compilation, it's up on Infowars.com, of Democrat leaders saying, oh we want to kill babies up until the time they're born, maybe even after they're born.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:25:04.384]   So there's just no end to how they keep pushing the envelope, Alexandria Cortez AOC calls for Supreme Court justices to be impeached, and it just goes on from there.
[00:25:04.404 --> 00:25:29.498]   We're going to be laying out the latest abortion news and how that ties into Biden, who the Democrats think can run on Roe v. Wade being overturned and misrepresenting what that really does, instead of the facts that they have accelerated inflation And the collapse of our borders and the devaluation of the currency.
[00:25:29.939 --> 00:25:31.760]  And here are those headlines.
[00:25:32.341 --> 00:25:40.248]  As gas prices surge, stations now hold up to $175 of your money when you swipe.
[00:25:40.868 --> 00:25:41.689]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:25:44.952 --> 00:25:45.973]  Why are they doing that?
[00:25:46.954 --> 00:25:59.661]  When drivers insert a credit card, debit card at the pump, the gas station doesn't know how much fuel they will buy, and it places a hold on the account for an amount set by the gas station, and they're letting it max out at $175.
[00:26:00.302 --> 00:26:05.765]  Some pumps only let you get $100, which won't even fill up most average tanks.
[00:26:06.245 --> 00:26:06.946]  But that's okay.
[00:26:08.257 --> 00:26:10.318]  Doesn't matter that gas prices have hit all-time records.
[00:26:10.958 --> 00:26:18.801]  Biden administration is planning a propaganda blitz to tout how he's delivering for the middle class and how great things are.
[00:26:21.062 --> 00:26:22.663]  That story's up on Infowars.com.
[00:26:25.184 --> 00:26:26.465]  There's all these questions being asked.
[00:26:26.485 --> 00:26:28.325]  Did corporate greed fuel inflation?
[00:26:30.546 --> 00:26:31.827]  It's not the biggest culprit.
[00:26:33.047 --> 00:26:37.885]   Well, it's corporate greed, wanting government contracts and other things,
[00:26:37.885 --> 00:26:42.645]   lobbying for more quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve.
[00:26:42.645 --> 00:26:44.905]  And so yes, corporations run the world.
[00:26:44.905 --> 00:26:50.047]   They set the policy, the Fortune 100, that control the Fortune 500,
[00:26:50.047 --> 00:26:52.047]  that controls the Fortune 5,000.
[00:26:52.047 --> 00:26:58.405]   And they deliberately created monetary policy that they knew would do exactly what they're doing.
[00:26:58.405 --> 00:27:03.287]   Destroy the middle class, destroy the currency, but transfer all the power in the process
[00:27:03.287 --> 00:27:05.646]  on the ride up to themselves.
[00:27:05.973 --> 00:27:10.175]  And now they're in charge, on top of us, on the ride down.
[00:27:11.716 --> 00:27:14.738]  Russia defaults on foreign debt for the first time since 1918.
[00:27:15.338 --> 00:27:20.181]  Bloomberg reports, Russia defaults on its foreign currency sovereign debt for the first time in a century.
[00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:26.405]  The culmination of ever-toughening Western sanctions that shut down payment routes to overseas creditors.
[00:27:26.985 --> 00:27:29.927]  That'll certainly not just hurt Russia, but hurt the world economy.
[00:27:31.431 --> 00:27:44.059]  More on that coming up, but I wanted to speak to the fact that Russia actually is now the biggest oil exporter in the world, passing up Saudi Arabia, who passed up the U.S.
[00:27:44.459 --> 00:27:47.501]  in the last year and a half under Biden.
[00:27:47.521 --> 00:27:53.204]  And many areas of the Russian economy are doing better than they were previously doing, while the Europe's economy and the U.S.
[00:27:53.244 --> 00:27:54.164]  economy is falling apart.
[00:27:54.625 --> 00:27:58.167]  You know the globalists know that, and they're making money on both sides.
[00:28:00.134 --> 00:28:17.967]  Now, let's continue here because I want to play several clips here discussing the Democrats breaking into the Arizona Capitol, Democrats blocking highways, Democrats saying we're in a civil war, Democrats saying get your armor on, saying get in the streets, you know, go out and intimidate people at their houses.
[00:28:19.861 --> 00:28:27.125]  But then if Republicans do one-tenth of that, we are Satan and must all be arrested and must see all put in jail.
[00:28:27.545 --> 00:28:34.209]  And not even the people that do stuff like that should be put in jail, but people that are just around or even trying to stop it need to be put in jail.
[00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.311]  A la January 6th.
[00:28:37.351 --> 00:28:45.915]  Here's several clips of NBC's reporters and others saying we're going into a civil war.
[00:28:46.176 --> 00:28:46.996]  Here's some of the rhetoric.
[00:28:48.353 --> 00:28:59.528]  There's a case where the Supreme Court is doing a decision that is going to fly in the face of at least what polls tell us is a majority of Americans, maybe 60 to 70%.
[00:29:01.431 --> 00:29:13.736]  And if you look at human history and American history, that tends to push a society into civil war, or at least towards civil war, if it's something that's as basic as this.
[00:29:14.456 --> 00:29:30.923]  I'm not saying this is the same as the Dred Scott decision in 1857, but basically that was a decision that said anyone who hopes for an end to slavery and for black people in America to be full first class citizens can give up hope.
[00:29:31.563 --> 00:29:33.985]  That did a lot to accelerate our civil war.
[00:29:34.565 --> 00:29:45.413]  I'm worried that when you have a Supreme Court making a decision like this and doing it in language that's almost provocative and angry and vengeful, it could have that effect.
[00:29:45.913 --> 00:29:46.834]  I love our country.
[00:29:46.894 --> 00:29:48.835]  Part of our country is unity.
[00:29:49.216 --> 00:29:50.436]  I think that's jeopardized.
[00:29:50.817 --> 00:29:55.120]  There is a war out there and we need to recognize that we've got to armor up.
[00:29:56.445 --> 00:29:56.905]  That's right.
[00:29:56.965 --> 00:29:58.046]  This is not a drill.
[00:29:58.126 --> 00:30:00.386]  We're in trouble, folks.
[00:30:00.426 --> 00:30:04.588]  The trans creature has cut some of his hair.
[00:30:04.688 --> 00:30:05.788]  It's over.
[00:30:05.607 --> 00:30:09.607]   I'm too afraid now Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:13.607]   I'm gonna light your heart So you won't see me
[00:30:13.607 --> 00:30:18.607]   We're in trouble folks, the trans creature has cut some of his hair
[00:30:18.607 --> 00:30:23.607]   It's over The she-maiden folks
[00:30:23.607 --> 00:30:26.607]   Ready to LARP Ready
[00:30:26.607 --> 00:30:30.922]   To play Dungeons and Dragons in the local park Oh, and they're going to talk to your kids.
[00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:37.826]  If you don't like it, well... Here's the Antifa burning the Gadsden flag and other flags out front of the Supreme Court.
[00:30:41.368 --> 00:30:44.910]  Again, here's another one of the deadly warriors.
[00:30:47.311 --> 00:30:48.351]  They're flame-torched.
[00:30:48.391 --> 00:30:49.692]  They're coming to get you.
[00:30:51.133 --> 00:30:51.813]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:53.774 --> 00:30:55.355]  Really, they just want access to your children.
[00:30:58.029 --> 00:31:01.292]  We've got a compilation of that coming up next segment.
[00:31:01.692 --> 00:31:08.158]  In fact, we're going to go to break and come back and really dig into this and tie it together with abortion, with the trans movement, wanting to sterilize children.
[00:31:08.759 --> 00:31:11.761]  All of it's about destroying lives, sterilizing people, killing people.
[00:31:11.781 --> 00:31:15.044]  I'm going to lay it out coming out next segment.
[00:31:15.144 --> 00:31:23.075]   But first, in this world of Destabilization and devaluation and inflation.
[00:31:23.716 --> 00:31:26.858]  The smartest move is to get high quality storable food from a trusted source.
[00:31:27.359 --> 00:31:28.880]  We have high quality storable food.
[00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:30.501]  Amazing quality.

[00:33:47.715 --> 00:33:57.215]   The Gay Agenda is coming home The Gay Agenda is here
[00:33:57.215 --> 00:34:14.739]   But you don't have to worry [Music]
[00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:18.739]   Ladies and gentlemen, we have hours and hours and hours of this.
[00:34:18.739 --> 00:34:22.739]  This is the Democratic Party culture.
[00:34:22.848 --> 00:34:28.455]  I was in New York last year to go on Andrew Schultz's podcast and to go on.
[00:34:29.858 --> 00:34:31.179]  Michael Malice's podcast.
[00:34:31.479 --> 00:34:32.280]  I was there four days.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.382]  And it was Gay Pride Month.
[00:34:35.402 --> 00:34:36.602]  It was this time last year.
[00:34:37.303 --> 00:34:47.530]  And, I mean, it was just flags everywhere, the churches, the people, men running around in dresses, and children being indoctrinated into a sex cult.
[00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:58.337]  It's about the sex and the future of the children so that they'll have their innocence destroyed and will be forced into this with groups saying, we're coming for your children, you won't stop us.
[00:34:59.718 --> 00:35:00.979]  They're doing it in the private schools.
[00:35:00.999 --> 00:35:02.080]  They're doing it in the public schools.
[00:35:02.741 --> 00:35:08.006]  There is a very big, large Christian school in Austin that's Episcopal.
[00:35:08.787 --> 00:35:16.194]  And I know a lot of people that go there, and a lot of people are pulling their children out, because I have, you know, four children, and two of them are still in school.
[00:35:17.275 --> 00:35:19.077]  They don't go there, but they have friends that go there.
[00:35:19.898 --> 00:35:22.721]  And so, my daughter's now going to kindergarten.
[00:35:22.741 --> 00:35:23.682]  She's just turned five.
[00:35:24.797 --> 00:35:28.876]   And so we were just talking to some of the parents about whether we're going to homeschool or something, or a small
[00:35:28.876 --> 00:35:29.536]  school.
[00:35:29.536 --> 00:35:33.376]   And they said, "Well, we're having to pull our six-year-old daughter out
[00:35:33.376 --> 00:35:38.077]   because she came home from the biggest private school in Austin
[00:35:38.077 --> 00:35:47.856]   that used to be right wings years ago and said, 'Boys can be girls, girls can be boys.
[00:35:47.856 --> 00:35:51.617]   You can pick your gender, but you can have two daddies, two mommies.'"
[00:35:51.751 --> 00:35:56.835]  I mean, what the hell is a six-year-old being taught that at a Christian school?
[00:35:57.495 --> 00:36:11.105]  It's taken over people, and it's gonna make you be part of it, just like in the biblical tale of Sodom and Gomorrah, where they come to your door and they say, come out in the street with us, we're gonna have sex with you in the street.
[00:36:11.706 --> 00:36:13.327]  If you live here, we have sex with you.
[00:36:15.481 --> 00:36:16.781]  It's an act of dominance.
[00:36:16.881 --> 00:36:17.521]  It's rape.
[00:36:17.941 --> 00:36:28.283]  I mean, the left has Gillette commercials and other corporate ads out saying if a guy tells a girl she's good-looking or asks a girl out, that's harassment and wrong and all sex is rape between a man and a woman.
[00:36:29.063 --> 00:36:29.764]  That's what they teach.
[00:36:30.244 --> 00:36:35.805]  But if it's a man teaching a five-year-old how to give a blowjob, well then it's a wonderful thing.
[00:36:35.845 --> 00:36:45.917]   Or if it's three-year-olds seeing naked men dance around and cut themselves in the streets of Seattle or Dallas, Well then it's a good thing!
[00:36:48.399 --> 00:36:49.159]  Imagine!
[00:36:50.300 --> 00:37:01.585]  I mean, you hear about some of these, like that Mormon break-off group in Texas, where he had like 10 wives, and some of them were like 16 years old, and he's in prison!
[00:37:03.786 --> 00:37:04.206]  For rape!
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.480]  Okay, put them in prison!
[00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:27.905]  These people are literally coming to your school and taking children to these sex bars and planting their flag of control over them and saying, we're here to recruit them, we're here to take them over, and they've got full Disney, full Hollywood, full Democratic Party backing, with the Democratic Party litmus test.
[00:37:29.403 --> 00:37:35.525]  At the Democrat debates, do you believe that men deserve access to abortion rights so they can have their babies?
[00:37:35.885 --> 00:37:39.247]  Yes, we've got to get men access to abortions.
[00:37:40.867 --> 00:37:44.469]  It's mind control, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:46.689 --> 00:37:48.350]  It's mind control.
[00:37:50.431 --> 00:37:56.233]  They have ads running everywhere, not just Gillette, saying a man talking to a woman is wrong and evil.
[00:37:58.837 --> 00:38:11.235]  But if you're gonna teach a five-year-old to sit on a convicted pedophile's lap while he rubs his genitals on him, I mean, we got stuff we can't even show you, folks, that we shot in Austin four years ago.
[00:38:13.799 --> 00:38:14.760]  That Millie Weaver shot.
[00:38:15.606 --> 00:38:16.347]  She did a great job.
[00:38:17.127 --> 00:38:29.477]  She went to one of their confabs at a big hotel in a conference room, and they had men, totally naked, with glitter on their penises, with three and four, five-year-old kids sitting in their lap.
[00:38:30.237 --> 00:38:35.421]  We've shown a little bit of it, but not the kids actually sitting on the genitals, because that is, that's child porn.
[00:38:37.022 --> 00:38:41.606]  They were in there producing child porn, in my view.
[00:38:43.223 --> 00:38:47.126]  We can't even show it to you because I will not distribute it.
[00:38:49.108 --> 00:38:52.110]  As journalists, we went there and it was criminal.
[00:38:54.932 --> 00:38:57.274]  We don't just have little kids taking their clothes off, folks.
[00:38:58.155 --> 00:39:00.497]  What we're showing you is what can be put out on air.
[00:39:01.738 --> 00:39:04.340]  And by the way, we called for criminal investigations of this.
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:05.401]  We called the police department.
[00:39:05.421 --> 00:39:08.323]  They're not going to do anything because the DA is a communist.
[00:39:09.204 --> 00:39:09.564]  On record.
[00:39:11.843 --> 00:39:13.743]  Here's a compilation from just a few years ago.
[00:39:13.764 --> 00:39:15.984]  We're having to make new ones because there's so much horrible new stuff.
[00:39:16.464 --> 00:39:19.425]  But here they are declaring, your children belong to us, we're coming for them.
[00:39:19.665 --> 00:39:20.605]  It's all pedophilic.
[00:39:20.945 --> 00:39:27.107]  And then remember, the abortion's to kill them, and the trans stuff is to confuse kids, have the state take them, and then sterilize them as well.
[00:39:27.287 --> 00:39:30.328]  They don't want to just rape them, they want to cut their testicles off.
[00:39:30.508 --> 00:39:31.068]  Here's the report.
[00:39:31.607 --> 00:39:38.089]  Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour called Drag Queen Storytime.
[00:39:38.249 --> 00:39:39.329]  My name is Blackberry.
[00:39:39.449 --> 00:39:40.930]  I'm a bearded drag queen.
[00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:43.650]  That means I'm a lady with lots of facial hair.
[00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:47.351]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for Drag Queen Storytime.
[00:39:47.431 --> 00:39:48.692]  Drag Queen Storytime.
[00:39:48.812 --> 00:39:55.834]  And we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[00:39:57.532 --> 00:40:02.614]  And we witnessed parents taking their children, as young as two, inside to take part.
[00:40:02.734 --> 00:40:04.554]  Talking, singing, and reading.
[00:40:05.154 --> 00:40:06.595]  We can both be grooms.
[00:40:06.715 --> 00:40:10.376]  To an audience of preschoolers, toddlers, and their caregivers.
[00:40:10.536 --> 00:40:14.397]  The hips on the drag queen go swish, swish, swish.
[00:40:14.497 --> 00:40:15.137]  Turn around.
[00:40:16.798 --> 00:40:17.498]  And shake your butt!
[00:40:17.538 --> 00:40:18.778]  Shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em!
[00:40:18.878 --> 00:40:22.039]  It was a first for this branch of the public library, too.
[00:40:22.259 --> 00:40:22.879]  Are you nervous?
[00:40:23.159 --> 00:40:23.320]  Yes.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.680]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[00:40:25.734 --> 00:40:25.934]  No.
[00:40:26.555 --> 00:40:31.980]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:37.564]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[00:40:37.805 --> 00:40:40.927]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[00:40:41.408 --> 00:40:46.112]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[00:40:46.312 --> 00:40:48.534]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[00:40:48.714 --> 00:40:49.975]  You could be a drag queen superhero.
[00:40:50.035 --> 00:40:51.276]  Are you nervous?
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.961]  They were all accepting.
[00:40:56.021 --> 00:41:00.466]  They all were happy about it and excited and giving me hugs and everything.
[00:41:00.486 --> 00:41:02.568]  Yeah, the woman gets up on her table, spreads her legs.
[00:41:02.648 --> 00:41:03.309]  It's a man.
[00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:05.832]  This is adult entertainment.
[00:41:06.072 --> 00:41:08.675]  Most people seem to walk away having a good time.
[00:41:08.755 --> 00:41:09.796]  A stardom young, right?
[00:41:10.036 --> 00:41:11.498]  A stardom young, right?
[00:41:11.598 --> 00:41:13.380]  Anyone can do drag.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:20.845]  Everyone can do drag.
[00:41:21.826 --> 00:41:30.654]  Everyone can do drag.
[00:41:30.714 --> 00:41:39.541]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston Public Library as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[00:41:39.821 --> 00:41:48.203]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[00:41:48.543 --> 00:41:51.864]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.
[00:41:52.084 --> 00:41:54.925]  This is Tatiana Malanina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[00:41:55.105 --> 00:41:56.606]  What has this world come to?
[00:41:56.906 --> 00:41:59.327]  It's come to a world where drag kids actually exist.
[00:41:59.427 --> 00:42:00.707]  And people do ketamine on a couch.
[00:42:03.069 --> 00:42:08.496]  Desmond is the world's youngest club kid, and we challenge you, as the people out there, to find a younger club kid.
[00:42:08.516 --> 00:42:09.097]  Will they find one?
[00:42:09.898 --> 00:42:10.058]  No.
[00:42:10.559 --> 00:42:17.888]  Please welcome Desmond Napolis, aka Desmond Is Amazing!
[00:42:17.909 --> 00:42:18.870]  Have you been to a nightclub?
[00:42:19.270 --> 00:42:19.431]  No.
[00:42:19.751 --> 00:42:19.991]  No?
[00:42:19.911 --> 00:42:20.411]  Oh, okay.
[00:42:20.411 --> 00:42:26.851]  [Music]
[00:42:26.851 --> 00:42:31.150]   Drag should be an all-ages thing, and some people consider it provocative.
[00:42:31.254 --> 00:42:33.895]  It's not inappropriate.
[00:42:34.015 --> 00:42:41.458]  Teach the children.
[00:42:41.578 --> 00:42:43.078]  Teach the children.
[00:42:43.097 --> 00:42:50.097]   And I wanna, I wanna dance all night Teach the children, teach the children
[00:42:50.097 --> 00:43:02.097]   I'm all about education Can I get a refill?
[00:43:02.097 --> 00:43:12.341]   And everywhere else it's called pedophilia But when it's done institutionally, and they can get away with people dressed up like demon clowns with your children.
[00:43:12.401 --> 00:43:14.962]  Pull up Tranny Time in the New York schools.
[00:43:15.182 --> 00:43:17.142]  This was put out in the New York Times, like it's wonderful.
[00:43:17.322 --> 00:43:21.263]  And it's the biggest scary looking group of weirdo pot-bellied men.
[00:43:21.303 --> 00:43:26.144]  Looks like a bunch of Dennis Hasterds running around with clown makeup on.
[00:43:26.724 --> 00:43:32.666]  Just hopping around, rubbing their giant bellies in front of children, and you're like, what alternate universe is this?!
[00:43:33.206 --> 00:43:34.827]  What planet did I wake up in?!
[00:43:37.187 --> 00:43:38.248]  We'll be back, stay with us.
[00:43:39.408 --> 00:43:51.892]  Alright, we're going deep down the rabbit hole on this Roe v. Wade decision and some of the other big decisions that just happened that are very good for the Second Amendment and the right of free speech, not just the right of children to not be butchered in their mother's wombs.
[00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:59.643]  And the pushback of the left with one of the top experts, the founder and head of LifeSite News, to be joining us.
[00:43:59.683 --> 00:44:03.506]  But I wanted to go to another one of these compilations we've done.
[00:44:03.526 --> 00:44:04.707]  We've got probably 20 of them.
[00:44:05.247 --> 00:44:06.848]  We just played one from about four years ago.
[00:44:07.348 --> 00:44:10.451]  Here's one from about a year ago or less that Rob Dew put together.
[00:44:10.471 --> 00:44:15.034]  And then we've got a new compilation bottom of the hour of the stuff happening at the pedophile parades.
[00:44:15.334 --> 00:44:15.794]  That's what they are.
[00:44:15.814 --> 00:44:17.075]  They're not gay parades.
[00:44:17.095 --> 00:44:18.076]  They're pedophile parades.
[00:44:18.976 --> 00:44:20.615]  So we're gonna show that.
[00:44:20.615 --> 00:44:26.655]   These are celebrations of their war against innocent, and this cult saying they're taking over our children
[00:44:26.655 --> 00:44:27.755]  and our lives.
[00:44:27.755 --> 00:44:30.494]   So that compilation is being put together from what happened over the weekend.
[00:44:30.494 --> 00:44:33.296]   It's coming up at the bottom of the hour, but first here's this report.
[00:44:33.296 --> 00:44:37.976]   We're gonna have a great night tonight, and for you people in Florida,
[00:44:37.976 --> 00:44:40.096]  we're gonna have a gay night.
[00:44:40.096 --> 00:44:43.096]  (audience cheering)
[00:44:43.096 --> 00:44:46.096]  Hi there, Governor Kate Brown here.
[00:44:45.997 --> 00:44:48.659]  In Oregon, we say gay.
[00:44:48.679 --> 00:44:53.643]  Oregonians are welcoming of our LGBTQIA community members.
[00:44:54.044 --> 00:44:59.609]  We want to make sure that Oregon is a safe, inclusive, and welcoming place for all.
[00:45:00.049 --> 00:45:00.129]  Gay!
[00:45:00.329 --> 00:45:00.389]  Gay!
[00:45:00.569 --> 00:45:00.629]  Gay!
[00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.350]  Gay!
[00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:01.630]  Gay!
[00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:01.891]  Gay!
[00:45:02.151 --> 00:45:02.251]  Gay!
[00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:02.571]  Gay!
[00:45:02.751 --> 00:45:02.831]  Gay!
[00:45:03.092 --> 00:45:03.292]  Gay!
[00:45:03.572 --> 00:45:03.712]  Gay!
[00:45:03.932 --> 00:45:04.072]  Gay!
[00:45:04.513 --> 00:45:04.573]  Gay!
[00:45:04.753 --> 00:45:04.833]  Gay!
[00:45:05.474 --> 00:45:05.534]  Gay!
[00:45:05.854 --> 00:45:05.934]  Gay!
[00:45:06.114 --> 00:45:06.174]  Gay!
[00:45:06.354 --> 00:45:06.475]  Gay!
[00:45:06.695 --> 00:45:06.795]  Gay!
[00:45:07.275 --> 00:45:07.335]  Gay!
[00:45:07.576 --> 00:45:07.656]  Gay!
[00:45:07.836 --> 00:45:07.896]  Gay!
[00:45:08.196 --> 00:45:08.256]  Gay!
[00:45:08.476 --> 00:45:08.536]  Gay!
[00:45:08.837 --> 00:45:08.917]  Gay!
[00:45:09.577 --> 00:45:09.677]  Gay!
[00:45:09.878 --> 00:45:09.938]  Gay!
[00:45:10.298 --> 00:45:10.378]  Gay!
[00:45:10.558 --> 00:45:10.658]  Gay!
[00:45:11.079 --> 00:45:11.159]  Gay!
[00:45:11.199 --> 00:45:11.259]  Gay!
[00:45:11.279 --> 00:45:14.165]   Gay They're literally obsessed with sex.
[00:45:14.225 --> 00:45:15.725]  That's what a pervert does.
[00:45:15.745 --> 00:45:18.586]  I mean, these people are just crazy.
[00:45:18.946 --> 00:45:21.087]  And they want access to your children.
[00:45:20.907 --> 00:45:22.907]  They got access to them.
[00:45:22.907 --> 00:45:24.907]  We said that! We said that!
[00:45:24.907 --> 00:45:36.907]  We said that! We said that!
[00:45:36.907 --> 00:45:38.907]  You think we're sinful?
[00:45:38.907 --> 00:45:42.358]   Oh You fight against our rights.
[00:45:42.498 --> 00:45:45.480]  You say we all lead lives you can't respect.
[00:45:46.261 --> 00:45:49.423]  We'll convert your children.
[00:45:49.463 --> 00:45:51.944]  Someone's got to teach them not to hate.
[00:45:53.125 --> 00:45:54.426]  We're coming, we are coming.
[00:45:54.466 --> 00:45:58.329]  Turns out a bunch of these people were convicted child rapists, of course.
[00:45:58.729 --> 00:46:00.810]  In the San Francisco gay choir.
[00:46:01.891 --> 00:46:05.894]  Not a gay choir, it's a child rape organization, in my view.
[00:46:07.964 --> 00:46:13.928]  A child raping their minds with their innocence.
[00:46:13.968 --> 00:46:16.230]  That's Austin right there.
[00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:23.694]  Men naked, posing with children.
[00:46:23.855 --> 00:46:28.998]  And at the degeneration rate of this, they'll be raping children in the town square within one year.
[00:46:29.118 --> 00:46:32.400]  I'm excited and giving me hugs and everything.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.542]  That's stardom young, right?
[00:46:39.462 --> 00:46:40.002]  Everyone can do that.
[00:46:40.062 --> 00:46:41.002]  But you don't have to worry.
[00:46:41.062 --> 00:46:43.743]  Because there's nothing wrong with standing by your side.
[00:46:43.783 --> 00:46:44.763]  Get on board and get ready.
[00:46:44.844 --> 00:46:46.844]  Because there's nothing wrong with standing by your side.
[00:46:46.904 --> 00:46:48.004]  Get on board and get ready.
[00:46:48.044 --> 00:46:50.145]  Because the moment always seems the best for pride.
[00:46:49.965 --> 00:46:54.965]   Drank should be an all-ager, they can tell you that people consider it provocative.
[00:46:54.965 --> 00:46:58.965]   You don't have to worry, there's just nothing wrong with standing by your side.
[00:46:58.965 --> 00:47:03.965]   Then get a board and get married, because a woman always needs a bit of her pride.
[00:47:03.965 --> 00:47:08.965]  Come on, try a little pride.
[00:47:08.965 --> 00:47:13.965]  We'll convert your children, then we'll turn to you.
[00:47:13.965 --> 00:47:19.965]  Giving up the fear inside is freeing like you never knew.
[00:47:19.965 --> 00:47:24.965]  Go and see San Francisco, go and turn up that disco.
[00:47:24.965 --> 00:47:29.965]  You'll forget you were ever upset.
[00:47:29.965 --> 00:47:36.965]  We'll convert your children, and make an ally of you yet.
[00:47:36.965 --> 00:47:38.965]  These are people that fell to Satan.
[00:47:39.309 --> 00:47:44.413]  These are soulless zombies now, that only collect their alive when they're destroying innocents.
[00:47:44.774 --> 00:47:45.935]  It should be very sad.
[00:47:45.995 --> 00:47:48.737]  We lost these people, and we should not make fun of them.
[00:47:48.777 --> 00:47:51.319]  We should stand against them and protect our children from them.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.202]  I'm pushing an overly sexualized agenda.
[00:47:54.462 --> 00:47:55.063]  Are you nervous?
[00:47:55.123 --> 00:47:55.243]  Yes.
[00:47:55.263 --> 00:47:56.944]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[00:47:57.285 --> 00:47:57.445]  No.
[00:47:57.785 --> 00:48:03.130]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[00:48:06.536 --> 00:48:09.237]  Yep, they go to city councils and they say we're grooming your children.
[00:48:10.177 --> 00:48:10.797]  They're ours.
[00:48:11.357 --> 00:48:13.118]  We're going to convince them to have their genitals cut off.
[00:48:13.398 --> 00:48:15.579]  If we can't abort them, we'll cut their genitals off later.
[00:48:17.919 --> 00:48:24.121]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two on this live Monday, June 27th broadcast.
[00:48:24.722 --> 00:48:32.444]  We have a true warrior and a champion of the fight for the unborn and now the born, they're wanting to kill babies, after they're born.
[00:48:34.099 --> 00:48:44.426]  A champion for life against euthanasia, against all of it, is John Henry Weston and he of course heads up the great organization LifeSiteNews.
[00:48:44.466 --> 00:48:53.472]  He's been on with us many times and I've been reading his website for more than a decade and covering the incredible information that they lay out at LifeSiteNews.com.
[00:48:55.089 --> 00:49:14.156]  And we couldn't get a better person on today to talk about this historic ruling last week and the responses to it and what the next phase of the battle is going to be, both by those drunk on the blood of the innocents and those of us whose hearts are convicted trying to stop it.
[00:49:14.476 --> 00:49:16.257]  The Democrats are now threatening civil war.
[00:49:17.312 --> 00:49:21.033]  They're now saying they're going to hand out morning after pills everywhere out of vending machines.
[00:49:21.393 --> 00:49:22.453]  That's going to be the new fight.
[00:49:22.494 --> 00:49:25.834]  Very toxic, very dangerous pills that can kill women.
[00:49:26.215 --> 00:49:28.815]  We've got all of this and more to discuss with him.
[00:49:29.355 --> 00:49:30.696]  And then it's all interconnected.
[00:49:30.876 --> 00:49:37.958]  The pedophile parades nationwide, parading children through the streets with naked men, eating feces, urinating on each other.
[00:49:38.158 --> 00:49:39.999]  Folks, we can't show you this on TV.
[00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:42.319]  We're on a lot of TV stations and cable stations.
[00:49:42.759 --> 00:49:47.739]   We can't show you this, but children are being subjected to it. So the stuff we showed you, if
[00:49:47.739 --> 00:49:53.309]   you think it was bad, earlier in the last hour is nothing. I literally have had
[00:49:53.309 --> 00:49:57.809]   nightmares in the last three days over having to review this stuff because it's one thing to see
[00:49:57.809 --> 00:50:05.840]   these sick pedophile pervert freaks dancing around, but little kids looking very upset, very
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:10.780]   threatened with their parents shoving them into the arms of Moloch to have their innocence
[00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:11.440]  destroyed.
[00:50:11.541 --> 00:50:12.722]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:50:13.343 --> 00:50:15.845]  This is true mass demonic possession in my view.
[00:50:16.065 --> 00:50:16.785]  But I'm ranting.
[00:50:17.606 --> 00:50:24.629]  I appreciate John Henry Weston, the head of LifeSiteNews, LifeSiteNews.com, joining us, a real-world expert on this.
[00:50:24.969 --> 00:50:34.153]  It's got to be satisfying, after your decades and decades of this long fight, beating one of the leading, if not the leading, pro-LifeSite in the world, to see so much success happening.
[00:50:34.173 --> 00:50:35.333]  And so, thank you for joining us.
[00:50:35.353 --> 00:50:36.074]  Congratulations.
[00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:38.495]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:39.135]  Good to be with you.
[00:50:40.155 --> 00:50:41.096]  Where do you want to start?
[00:50:42.536 --> 00:50:43.817]  Well, first of all, praise God.
[00:50:45.143 --> 00:50:47.124]  What an incredible thing.
[00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:48.824]  And who would have thought?
[00:50:48.844 --> 00:51:01.187]  I think realists, like you are, would have said, I don't know, even though, yes, we made some good appointments, but then there've been betrayals among the Supreme Court justices.
[00:51:02.428 --> 00:51:07.789]  But Trump gave us what we needed to get over the hump in terms of Supreme Court.
[00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:10.010]  But it was still incredible.
[00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:17.427]   When the leak came in May and the left went insane, There was a lot still on the table.
[00:51:17.887 --> 00:51:27.874]  We knew that should one of the justices be killed, which was a very real possibility, that the leaked ruling or the draft ruling wouldn't stand.
[00:51:28.654 --> 00:51:32.496]  And that's why we had an attempt on the life of Justice Kavanaugh.
[00:51:33.697 --> 00:51:55.973]   And it's incredible because truly what I think happened was the prayer that went into defending the lives of the justices and the prayer that has gone into Ending Roe v. Wade for 50 years has come true, so that our Lord is able to now... You're going to see a very divided United States.
[00:51:57.894 --> 00:52:11.737]  You're going to have some states where the blood will continue to be shed, where the blood of the innocent, which cries to heaven for vengeance, as the scriptures say, will continue to flow.
[00:52:12.853 --> 00:52:26.342]  But in certain states, 10 right off the bat, but another 10 that are going to come online very soon, the protection of life of the innocent in their mother's womb is now protected by law the way it should be.
[00:52:27.423 --> 00:52:36.008]  All of a sudden, at least this basic element of civilization has been restored to a good part of the United States of America.
[00:52:37.209 --> 00:52:42.593]  So that God's blessing can once again flow, but it's a divided America.
[00:52:43.604 --> 00:52:53.094]  You have all these other states, which want to call themselves a sanctuary for abortion, where they're saying, please come, let us kill your children.
[00:52:54.035 --> 00:52:57.419]  They put it, of course, in their own terminology, but that's exactly what it is.
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:52:59.942]  So it's a divide in America.
[00:53:00.743 --> 00:53:05.608]  And what the ruling does is it brings the battle to the states.
[00:53:06.665 --> 00:53:23.071]  No longer can the federal government force abortion on unwilling states so that in Alabama and other places where they want that the legislature was voted in to protect life, no longer can the federals just say, hey, you got to do it anyway.
[00:53:24.031 --> 00:53:27.392]  Most of your people, the vast majority of your people want to protect life.
[00:53:27.712 --> 00:53:28.192]  Tough luck.
[00:53:28.673 --> 00:53:30.293]  We're going to kill your babies anyhow.
[00:53:30.313 --> 00:53:31.274]  We're going to legalize it.
[00:53:31.434 --> 00:53:32.234]  No, no more.
[00:53:33.134 --> 00:53:35.315]  Now the states get to decide for themselves.
[00:53:36.374 --> 00:53:37.414]  So the battle is there.
[00:53:37.455 --> 00:53:41.216]  Now, at the state level, there's a lot of work to be done.
[00:53:41.996 --> 00:54:06.587]   And the work to be done is not only at the legislative level, but it's also obviously working to change minds and hearts to support women who find themselves in troubled pregnancies, in unexpected pregnancies, to educate people on abstinence and on the reality of marriage and everything else that leads to life and this great gift of sexuality, which is meant for procreation, And to bring it all back to normalcy.
[00:54:06.647 --> 00:54:08.408]  So we need to get there.
[00:54:08.528 --> 00:54:15.011]  There's a lot of work to be done, but an amazing first step because while some people say, oh, it does nothing, it does nothing.
[00:54:15.551 --> 00:54:25.196]  Actually, it does something because the law, in addition to what it is on its face in terms of protection and police powers, is also a teacher.
[00:54:25.956 --> 00:54:40.607]   So the very fact that laws are now on the books in many states that protect life from conception, We'll teach people that, once again, the value of life is real and it should be protected.
[00:54:40.627 --> 00:54:42.268]  It should be protected in law.
[00:54:43.089 --> 00:54:47.091]  I'm not a theologian like you and many of your crew are.
[00:54:47.131 --> 00:55:04.976]   I know you're just immersed in it, but I remember Sunday school and reading the Bible and it just seems like common sense to me that God wanted governments to have righteous rules and God would hold it against the population, even if a lot of the population was good, if the government was carrying out evil and that if the people didn't oppose
[00:55:04.976 --> 00:55:08.936]   it they would then basically not receive the blessings of God anymore and that's how I
[00:55:08.936 --> 00:55:13.737]   see this it it it divides the wheat from the chaff the goats from the sheep it'll bring the
[00:55:13.737 --> 00:55:20.096]   evil of these people out in the open and how horrible they act and and the simulation of killing
[00:55:20.096 --> 00:55:25.056]   children and them admitting it's about killing babies and really the operating system of the
[00:55:25.056 --> 00:55:30.677]   democrats is now overtly satanistic getting more intense and so that bringing out this evil will then
[00:55:30.677 --> 00:55:36.266]   further convict other people's hearts to really wake up and understand this is a battle between
[00:55:36.266 --> 00:55:41.215]   good and evil and so I do see this as a gigantic victory as you were saying moving us really fast
[00:55:41.215 --> 00:55:46.186]   in the right direction and Trump was far from perfect but his grand amazing
[00:55:46.186 --> 00:55:47.786]  Thank you. - Amazing.
[00:55:47.258 --> 00:55:52.538]   victory, his supreme legacy, regardless of what happens to Trump in the future, is that
[00:55:52.538 --> 00:55:56.658]   he said he would do this in that debate six years ago with Hillary and he deliberate on
[00:55:56.658 --> 00:56:01.617]   it and it happened and that makes Trump amazing and a blessing and an incredible man.
[00:56:01.617 --> 00:56:06.698]   You judge a tree by its fruits, no way Trump's bad doing something like that.
[00:56:06.698 --> 00:56:07.977]  Well absolutely so.
[00:56:08.157 --> 00:56:09.438]  What an incredible gift.
[00:56:09.698 --> 00:56:22.746]  If he did absolutely nothing else, that would have been worth it in spades because the number of American children's lives he's saved by those appointments will only be seen in the future and it will redound to his own blessing.
[00:56:22.766 --> 00:56:26.108]  You know, there's a lot that Trump has to answer for, but you know what?
[00:56:26.148 --> 00:56:28.790]  This is going to work in his favor when he has to meet his maker.
[00:56:29.811 --> 00:56:33.293]  In terms of what you were talking about, it's very interesting.
[00:56:34.682 --> 00:56:40.087]  Yes, the bombing and firebombing of churches and vandalism and threats.
[00:56:41.288 --> 00:56:46.872]  And all of the hell that we're seeing break out because the demon has had a defeat and now he's flailing.
[00:56:47.853 --> 00:56:58.042]  And as you put it in his minions, these aren't so much, these are people who are lost, that are given to Satan, the anger, the violence that is coming out of them right now.
[00:56:59.545 --> 00:57:04.628]  Hopefully they'll look in the mirror and be able to see it for what it is and turn around.
[00:57:05.748 --> 00:57:12.932]  But the one effect that you mentioned that is so powerful is that others will get to see.
[00:57:14.032 --> 00:57:15.013]  Eyes will be opened.
[00:57:15.993 --> 00:57:18.635]  In a way, I think that right now it's not.
[00:57:19.515 --> 00:57:28.300]  People can see in the destruction of churches, in the vandalism, the firebombing, the threats to people's lives, the willingness to even commit murder.
[00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:40.308]  People will say, wait a minute, I thought this was a movement about choice and honoring women and these fetuses weren't children, really.
[00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:49.355]  But all of a sudden, it's becoming clear, Satan is letting his guard down in order to whip up a frenzy.
[00:57:49.375 --> 00:57:49.896]  That's right.
[00:57:49.936 --> 00:57:50.977]  Stay right there, John Henry.
[00:57:50.997 --> 00:57:51.817]  You've got to come right back.
[00:57:51.857 --> 00:57:53.619]  This is incredibly important information.
[00:57:54.994 --> 00:58:02.456]  We have literally hours and hours of Democrats right here in Austin this weekend saying, I love Satan!
[00:58:02.476 --> 00:58:03.696]  I want to kill children!
[00:58:05.057 --> 00:58:08.238]  And you think, okay, they're just trying to freak you out.
[00:58:08.278 --> 00:58:09.618]  But we've infiltrated their meetings.
[00:58:10.078 --> 00:58:11.338]  We've played the undercover videos.
[00:58:11.839 --> 00:58:13.359]  Project Veritas has as well.
[00:58:14.299 --> 00:58:16.120]  They have really adopted Satanism.
[00:58:16.983 --> 00:58:22.026]  And a few years ago, that Satanic Temple put out that movie, it's called Hail Satan.
[00:58:22.386 --> 00:58:32.611]  I went and saw it with my wife, and the audience at Alamo Draft House was full of people laughing at the Christians, cheering the Satanists and saying Hail Satan, like they think it's cute and funny, but it's not a joke.
[00:58:33.171 --> 00:58:35.192]  They're actually taking it up.
[00:58:35.252 --> 00:58:38.974]  It's like a child pretending to be a police officer or a fireman, and they become one later.
[00:58:39.554 --> 00:58:47.398]  Okay, I mean, it's all ha-ha-ha, and there's national articles about the fastest-growing religion among Democrats and leftists is Satanism.
[00:58:47.618 --> 00:58:48.018]  Look it up.
[00:58:48.898 --> 00:58:53.600]  And these satanic churches admit it's a sacrament of sacrifice.
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:54.521]  We always told you that.
[00:58:54.781 --> 00:59:00.083]  This is deadly serious, and it's backed by the big corporations and by Disney and others.
[00:59:00.363 --> 00:59:04.925]  And this whole agenda of dehumanizing is run by the god of this world, the fallen.
[00:59:04.945 --> 00:59:06.466]  We're going to talk to one of the leading figures.
[00:59:06.966 --> 00:59:08.746]  Battling this evil, how historic this is in a moment.
[00:59:08.927 --> 00:59:09.907]  But here's just two clips.
[00:59:10.307 --> 00:59:15.048]  One from Saturday, with our reporter Savannah Hernandez, Drew Hernandez, out front of the Supreme Court.
[00:59:15.348 --> 00:59:16.768]  Just one clip of hundreds we got.
[00:59:17.128 --> 00:59:17.969]  This was part of the course.
[00:59:18.269 --> 00:59:25.790]  And then a clip from a few years ago of an abortion doctor sounding exactly the same with the, I hate the children, I don't want to have children.
[00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:26.351]  Here it is.
[00:59:26.931 --> 00:59:28.091]  Let's have a conversation.
[00:59:28.111 --> 00:59:28.491]  Calm down.
[00:59:28.511 --> 00:59:28.851]  Let's decide.
[00:59:28.871 --> 00:59:29.951]  No, let's not have a conversation.
[00:59:30.352 --> 00:59:30.672]  Calm down.
[00:59:30.692 --> 00:59:31.352]  Calm down, sir.
[00:59:31.432 --> 00:59:33.912]  Or at least a little bit of shit.
[00:59:33.932 --> 00:59:36.413]  I guess the pandemic's over.
[00:59:40.406 --> 00:59:40.946]  What's wrong, sir?
[00:59:40.986 --> 00:59:41.807]  You like killing babies?
[00:59:42.127 --> 00:59:42.968]  You love killing babies?
[00:59:43.308 --> 00:59:44.329]  Yeah, I love killing babies.
[00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:45.690]  You love killing babies, huh?
[00:59:46.051 --> 00:59:47.012]  You love that, don't you?
[00:59:47.132 --> 00:59:47.772]  You love that.
[00:59:49.253 --> 00:59:50.394]  Sir, you gotta repent, sir.
[00:59:51.375 --> 00:59:53.757]  You gotta repent, sir, for murdering babies.
[00:59:55.779 --> 00:59:56.059]  Why?
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:57.921]  Because it's a sin before God.
[00:59:58.021 --> 00:59:58.341]  Why?
[00:59:59.643 --> 01:00:00.203]  Stinky breath.
[01:00:00.363 --> 01:00:02.365]  Yeah, that's pretty evil of you, sir.
[01:00:02.485 --> 01:00:03.045]  Yeah, I am.
[01:00:03.086 --> 01:00:04.227]  And I hope and pray that you...
[01:00:06.929 --> 01:00:08.091]  Well, that's what you do to babies, huh?
[01:00:08.131 --> 01:00:09.112]  Yeah, I love it.
[01:00:09.612 --> 01:00:10.093]  You love it, huh?
[01:00:10.133 --> 01:00:10.734]  Yeah, I do.
[01:00:10.754 --> 01:00:12.976]  Okay, I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[01:00:13.197 --> 01:00:14.198]  Oh, I'd never go to Christ.
[01:00:14.218 --> 01:00:15.720]  I hope that you come to Christ, sir.
[01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:16.781]  No, I don't go to Christ.
[01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:18.463]  Yeah, you... I don't listen to Christ.
[01:00:18.503 --> 01:00:19.844]  You will have a darkened heart, sir.
[01:00:19.864 --> 01:00:21.486]  I do have a darkened heart, yeah.
[01:00:21.526 --> 01:00:22.407]  You have a darkened heart.
[01:00:22.427 --> 01:00:23.769]  I do, I do, very, very much so.
[01:00:23.809 --> 01:00:25.631]  And you will stand before God in judgment day?
[01:00:25.651 --> 01:00:26.232]  Yes, I will.
[01:00:26.612 --> 01:00:26.973]  Every day.
[01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:28.773]  You will stand before God and judge him.
[01:00:28.813 --> 01:00:29.414]  Yes, I will.
[01:00:29.494 --> 01:00:29.914]  Every day.
[01:00:30.034 --> 01:00:31.194]  All of the babies that you have killed.
[01:00:31.274 --> 01:00:31.754]  I love it.
[01:00:31.774 --> 01:00:32.154]  I love it.
[01:00:32.274 --> 01:00:33.395]  Yeah, keep tearing the babies apart.
[01:00:33.515 --> 01:00:33.975]  Yeah, I will.
[01:00:34.155 --> 01:00:36.136]  Keep tearing the babies apart.
[01:00:36.216 --> 01:00:36.936]  I will.
[01:00:36.956 --> 01:00:38.236]  Keep tearing the babies apart.
[01:00:39.236 --> 01:00:40.077]  Yes, sir.
[01:00:40.117 --> 01:00:42.077]  The babies, their blood streams from the ground.
[01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.978]  Their blood streams from the ground.
[01:00:43.998 --> 01:00:44.878]  You are a murderer, sir.
[01:00:44.898 --> 01:00:45.818]  You are a murderer, sir.
[01:00:45.838 --> 01:00:51.500]  For any listeners that don't know, he's in his face hissing like a demon with a pair of scissors in his hand.
[01:00:53.357 --> 01:01:02.245]  And, ladies and gentlemen, if you don't believe me, I'm begging you, go to a pro-death rally, and these people are the majority, not the minority now.
[01:01:02.365 --> 01:01:09.191]  Women, men, old people, young people, black people, brown people, but majority white people, literally hissing and acting like demons.
[01:01:09.551 --> 01:01:10.572]  You can't make this up.
[01:01:11.112 --> 01:01:14.215]  And we can't show you the footage of these pedophile pride parades.
[01:01:14.595 --> 01:01:16.117]  You gotta go to one for yourself.
[01:01:16.157 --> 01:01:17.098]  You gotta see it for yourself.
[01:01:17.538 --> 01:01:18.659]  It's so unbelievable.
[01:01:18.699 --> 01:01:20.120]  They're eating feces off the ground.
[01:01:21.101 --> 01:01:25.203]  I can't even say it on air, and I even feel evil repeating this stuff, folks, but you gotta know.
[01:01:25.603 --> 01:01:30.385]  So, the poison's coming out, the world's seeing it, very eloquent words by John Henry Weston.
[01:01:30.405 --> 01:01:32.005]  Everybody should visit LifeSiteNews.com.
[01:01:32.406 --> 01:01:39.108]  Next segment, we'll have the floor, but I wanted to spend some time there, but in the five minutes we have left in the shorter segment, what do you make of what we just saw?
[01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:42.630]  Doesn't that illustrate what you're saying about the mask is coming off the demons?
[01:01:42.970 --> 01:01:48.272]  We see that in the Bible, historically, that when the devil starts losing, he drops the mask.
[01:01:49.992 --> 01:01:50.653]  It does indeed.
[01:01:51.714 --> 01:01:52.674]  It's an incredible thing.
[01:01:52.714 --> 01:01:53.735]  It's happening everywhere.
[01:01:54.316 --> 01:01:59.700]  I second you in encouraging people to go to pro-abortion demonstrations.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:01.942]  In fact, just go to the March for Life.
[01:02:02.623 --> 01:02:04.404]  You'll find the protesters at the March for Life.
[01:02:04.664 --> 01:02:10.855]   In fact, when we were at the March for Life just recently in Canada, There was a guy at the back with a satanic flag.
[01:02:11.155 --> 01:02:12.515]  He was screaming, hail Satan.
[01:02:12.555 --> 01:02:13.735]  We asked him, why are you here?
[01:02:14.435 --> 01:02:15.235]  Because I'm a Satanist.
[01:02:15.255 --> 01:02:17.396]  So you're at the Pro-Abortion March because you're a Satanist?
[01:02:17.476 --> 01:02:17.756]  Yes.
[01:02:18.556 --> 01:02:21.057]  We also talked to one of these handmaids women.
[01:02:22.057 --> 01:02:26.138]  It was 30, 32, 33 degrees Celsius.
[01:02:26.318 --> 01:02:28.178]  So in Fahrenheit, it's over 90.
[01:02:28.938 --> 01:02:30.999]  And we asked her, what are you doing here?
[01:02:31.399 --> 01:02:31.619]  What?
[01:02:32.019 --> 01:02:32.239]  What?
[01:02:32.759 --> 01:02:35.920]  You know, why are you doing this when it's so hot and yet you're doing this?
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.900]  She said, it's spiritual.
[01:02:39.116 --> 01:02:40.897]  So, it's very real.
[01:02:41.178 --> 01:02:42.439]  It's very out there.
[01:02:42.919 --> 01:02:44.520]  This is a satanic movement.
[01:02:44.921 --> 01:02:48.043]  The mask is coming down, and you're able to see it for yourself.
[01:02:48.483 --> 01:03:04.275]  And hopefully, a lot of that middle America that isn't really on either side, but they're generally what they call pro-choice, we want women to do what they do, finally can see, wait a minute, gee whiz, this is really the side of evil.
[01:03:05.016 --> 01:03:05.876]  And it's time to wake up.
[01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:06.617]  It's time to turn around.
[01:03:08.118 --> 01:03:15.601]  And really on the part of those who value life, those who value God, we have to understand this is on us.
[01:03:16.561 --> 01:03:17.562]  Remember what the scriptures say?
[01:03:18.822 --> 01:03:28.086]  If my people will turn from their wicked ways, if they will turn to me and heed my voice, I will bless their land.
[01:03:29.026 --> 01:03:38.315]   The whole land, the whole of the United States of America, the whole of the West will be blessed if Christians Turn to Christ.
[01:03:38.456 --> 01:03:47.760]  If Christians get on their knees, the only way we got to the overturning of Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs decision just now was because of prayer.
[01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.481]  Get your prayer pants on.
[01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:53.463]  Wear out those praying knees, as the song says.
[01:03:54.103 --> 01:03:55.664]  This is what we need in America.
[01:03:55.684 --> 01:03:57.485]  This is what we need in the whole of the world.
[01:03:58.005 --> 01:04:00.506]  And this is the path to victory.
[01:04:01.292 --> 01:04:03.033]  And Christ has already won that victory.
[01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:08.416]  It's just ours now to join Him in our own little sacrifices with His on the cross.
[01:04:09.477 --> 01:04:11.818]  And for that, we will be blessed in amazing ways.
[01:04:12.498 --> 01:04:14.019]  What do you expect them to do next?
[01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:15.020]  They're threatening violence.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.120]  They're carrying out violence.
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:17.521]  They are just beside themselves.
[01:04:17.961 --> 01:04:19.522]  They're talking about packing the court.
[01:04:19.542 --> 01:04:21.163]  They're talking about impeaching the court.
[01:04:21.203 --> 01:04:22.564]  I mean, they are in a red rage.
[01:04:23.024 --> 01:04:24.345]  How do you see this affecting the election?
[01:04:24.685 --> 01:04:25.546]  I think it backfires.
[01:04:25.586 --> 01:04:27.447]  I think it energizes Christians and conservatives.
[01:04:27.727 --> 01:04:31.289]   And as you said, short story, I'm not name-dropping, it's where I was.
[01:04:31.289 --> 01:04:35.890]   I was at my, he's a big Christian now, been a Christian a long time, but Jesse James,
[01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:40.969]   famous outlaw guy, and his wife, he's marrying a really nice lady, but with her own story
[01:04:40.969 --> 01:04:45.969]   passed, and a bunch of these friends were there, some of which I've known for years,
[01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:50.530]   because I've known Jesse for a long time, and they're all right-wing conservatives now.
[01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:53.452]  He's been a right-winger forever, but they're all right-wing conservatives now.
[01:04:53.672 --> 01:04:54.953]  They used to be super liberal women.
[01:04:55.214 --> 01:05:00.179]  And we're sitting around the table, they're like, I used to be pro-abortion, like it was just a choice, and you know, it doesn't feel anything.
[01:05:00.219 --> 01:05:04.223]  Now I know it's about power and control, and it's a ritual, and it's evil.
[01:05:04.243 --> 01:05:08.407]  And all these liberal women, who'd been liberal, are now super right-wing Christians.
[01:05:08.787 --> 01:05:09.628]  You know, it's truly amazing, Alex.
[01:05:09.648 --> 01:05:10.028]  Norma McCorvey.
[01:05:09.847 --> 01:05:13.246]   Of course, I went to church with Jesse as well and his wife yesterday, but the point
[01:05:13.246 --> 01:05:18.248]   is is that they're being converted by seeing the evil of these minions.
[01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:21.487]   That's that they're like, I don't want to be like that person because they see how soulless
[01:05:21.487 --> 01:05:23.606]  and ugly and horrible they are.
[01:05:23.606 --> 01:05:24.766]  And it makes them scared.
[01:05:24.766 --> 01:05:28.087]  Gosh, I don't want to be one of those.
[01:05:28.087 --> 01:05:30.527]  You know, it's truly amazing, Alex.
[01:05:30.527 --> 01:05:41.327]   Norma McCorvey, the Roe of Roe v. Wade, was herself taken in by abortion supporters who
[01:05:41.327 --> 01:05:44.768]  basically sort of cajoled her into doing what she did.
[01:05:44.768 --> 01:05:54.768]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:05:46.581 --> 01:05:48.222]  And she saw the light after.
[01:05:48.622 --> 01:05:49.903]  She had a conversion.
[01:05:50.403 --> 01:05:51.424]  She became a Christian.
[01:05:51.464 --> 01:05:54.225]  She fought for life for the rest of her life.
[01:05:55.386 --> 01:05:57.788]  And she was, of course, scarred by what happened to her.
[01:05:57.928 --> 01:06:09.278]   But She worked with an organization called Silent No More, which is connected to Priests for Life, the great Father Frank Pavone and his great friend and co-worker Janet Morena.
[01:06:10.698 --> 01:06:13.799]  And they were with Norma as Norma was dying.
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:20.741]  And she begged them to continue the fight until Roe v. Wade was overturned.
[01:06:21.962 --> 01:06:33.077]   And I texted them on Friday, the both of them, Father Pavone and Janet Morena, and I said to them, You can tell Norma now, promise fulfilled.
[01:06:33.538 --> 01:06:34.878]  Beautiful, stay there, we'll be right back.
[01:06:35.139 --> 01:06:36.399]  They promised that they would work.
[01:06:36.419 --> 01:06:37.260]  Let's repeat that when we come back.
[01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:42.783]  As you can see and hear, he's a very eloquent, smart individual and we should try to get him on more often.
[01:06:42.803 --> 01:06:44.404]  He's a busy guy, hard to get on.
[01:06:44.924 --> 01:06:47.505]  John Henry Westin, LifeSiteNews.com.
[01:06:47.525 --> 01:06:48.326]  And I want to just say this.
[01:06:48.826 --> 01:06:49.867]  He got caught off by the break.
[01:06:49.887 --> 01:06:54.150]  I want him to tell that story over again because it was bringing tears to my eyes and his as well.
[01:06:54.190 --> 01:06:59.814]  And I think it leads into my next question that I want to really try to not be so excited and give him the floor to cover other key aspects.
[01:06:59.834 --> 01:07:06.998]  He's one of the leading experts in the world on the pro-life movement and how it ties into everything and this battle between good versus evil.
[01:07:08.018 --> 01:07:12.742]  But I think you were expanding into the fact that people have invested time, energy, their will.
[01:07:12.822 --> 01:07:15.204]  People have been sent to prison for peacefully protesting.
[01:07:15.684 --> 01:07:20.949]  This is a big win, but the real battle to win the war is now just starting.
[01:07:21.469 --> 01:07:27.975]  And if we just hold the line against all their venom and hate and violence, we're going to see a huge revival coming out of this.
[01:07:28.015 --> 01:07:30.517]  And you can already see it, so we've just got to hold the line.
[01:07:30.557 --> 01:07:34.200]  But please, finish your story, elaborate on that, and then other facets you'd like to get into.
[01:07:36.028 --> 01:08:03.563]   So the story really is of Norma McCorvey, the Roe of Roe v. Wade, who after she was used by abortion supporters to do this law in 1973, and just the horror of it, That affected her for the rest of her life, and she eventually was converted to be pro-life, then to be a Christian, and finally she worked as a Catholic with Priests for Life and also Silent No More.
[01:08:03.943 --> 01:08:14.308]  Silent No More, an organization of women who have themselves had abortions and speak out now for life, trying to get other women to avoid the damage that was caused them by abortion.
[01:08:15.149 --> 01:08:23.077]   And so Norma, as she was dying, She held the hand of Janet Morana, now the head of Silent No More, and
[01:08:25.137 --> 01:08:35.002]  She basically begged Father Frank Pavone and Janet Moreno to see to it that the end of Roe v. Wade would happen.
[01:08:35.483 --> 01:08:43.647]  And I texted them on Friday to tell them that indeed, promised fulfilled is what you can tell Norma now as she's in the afterlife.
[01:08:44.027 --> 01:08:45.348]  That is powerful.
[01:08:46.468 --> 01:08:52.596]   Again, I've got a lot of questions here, John Henry, but What other areas should we be aware of?
[01:08:52.656 --> 01:08:53.696]  What should we be looking for?
[01:08:53.756 --> 01:08:54.997]  What's the next leg of the battle?
[01:08:55.477 --> 01:08:58.578]  Looks to me like they're going to push morning after pills and vending machines.
[01:08:58.678 --> 01:08:59.978]  I mean, they're saying that's their plan.
[01:09:00.018 --> 01:09:01.499]  Is that something big to be watching?
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.840]  Well, it is indeed.
[01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:10.382]  The fact of abortion being killing and child sacrifice is very real.
[01:09:10.842 --> 01:09:16.365]  So that when they do it, no matter how small the children are, it's still abortion.
[01:09:16.405 --> 01:09:17.445]  It's still killing babies.
[01:09:18.118 --> 01:09:21.000]  And the effect on the people's souls is also still there.
[01:09:21.981 --> 01:09:29.967]  So, whether they're doing it by a morning after pill or the abortion pill, the early abortion pill, whatever they're using, they're damaging.
[01:09:30.007 --> 01:09:41.015]  Now, in addition to the spiritual harm that it causes, the fact that you are engaging in murder and associating yourself with murder, there is also the physical health consequences to the mother.
[01:09:41.055 --> 01:09:42.656]  They take these drugs which are deadly.
[01:09:43.872 --> 01:09:54.141]  And then they don't get the proper medical care afterward because very often abortionists are concerned basically about getting the job done in terms of killing the baby.
[01:09:54.762 --> 01:10:00.727]  And as we've seen so many countless times, they don't really give a care about the woman after the fact.
[01:10:01.007 --> 01:10:03.269]  If she bleeds to death, oh well, that's on her.
[01:10:04.771 --> 01:10:05.691]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:05.712 --> 01:10:08.894]  And who's there to pick up the pieces on the other side of abortion?
[01:10:09.435 --> 01:10:10.616]  The pro-life movement as well.
[01:10:11.238 --> 01:10:13.239]  So that's an incredible thing you can look at.
[01:10:13.279 --> 01:10:20.181]  But what is coming up is yes, that pushing, but there's also the want to do it anyway.
[01:10:21.142 --> 01:10:33.126]  I believe it was Senator Warren is talking about getting Biden to make for some kind of area inside the states where abortion is now illegal to do it anyway.
[01:10:34.227 --> 01:10:39.709]  They're going to try anything by hook or by crook, because again, for them, this is like a sacrament, as you said.
[01:10:40.877 --> 01:10:44.060]  And they might be deluded with this is a women's right and so on.
[01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:51.826]  But what's coming out now with all of the violence and the extremity is many people will see it for what it really is.
[01:10:51.846 --> 01:10:55.089]  And God willing, we'll have more pushback.
[01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:59.133]  So we'll see this, this war fight out and it will be a war.
[01:10:59.753 --> 01:11:08.225]   They've already shown That they will commit violence, not only violence against children in the womb, they're firebombing churches and pregnancy centers.
[01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:23.234]  Jane's Revenge, that organization that's somehow publicly threatening people, talked about even how the next actions they take won't be as simple as cleaning up from a fire or some vandalism.
[01:11:23.774 --> 01:11:33.906]   So they're talking about real, actual, harmful violence that might Kill people, who knows what they're talking about, but this is very real.
[01:11:34.787 --> 01:11:36.628]  And so we have to be ready for that.
[01:11:37.549 --> 01:11:45.715]  On Faith and Reason, which is one of the shows that LifeSite puts out, we spoke of how churches and pregnancy centers need to protect themselves.
[01:11:46.676 --> 01:11:49.498]  Churches, for instance, need to develop security teams.
[01:11:50.259 --> 01:11:54.422]  We talked about how outside your church you might park a van, a security van outside.
[01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:56.581]  A lot of churches are already doing this.
[01:11:56.621 --> 01:12:04.225]  They're shutting down most entrances, having people only enter through the one entrance, so that ushers and your security team can be there.
[01:12:04.245 --> 01:12:05.345]  And you know what's really neat?
[01:12:06.486 --> 01:12:15.010]  You can involve all those young men, those young men between the ages of 19 and 25, who you very rarely see at church.
[01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.290]  You know what?
[01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:16.131]  They've got a job now.
[01:12:16.911 --> 01:12:22.600]   They can put all of those muscles and their bigness to the test by The church needs protection.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:25.001]  Your parents, your grandparents need protection.
[01:12:25.461 --> 01:12:29.544]  Your little brothers and sisters or your nephews and nieces need protection.
[01:12:30.004 --> 01:12:33.086]  Come and stand there and protect the house of God.
[01:12:33.826 --> 01:12:41.170]  At the same time, they can hear the message of the Lord and they can come on side with the faith in Jesus Christ, which will lead them to embrace life.
[01:12:42.031 --> 01:12:44.532]  There's opportunity in all of this for us.
[01:12:45.033 --> 01:12:50.120]   So even though, yes, there's hard times coming, We need to pull up our bootstraps.
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.161]  We need to work really hard.
[01:12:51.641 --> 01:13:00.788]  We have an opportunity now to save lives and to work now in the state legislatures to get to the point where we can elect pro-life representatives.
[01:13:01.589 --> 01:13:11.356]  And that's why, as you keep saying, to make sure elections are fair and properly run is so key to what we're going to see in November.
[01:13:12.076 --> 01:13:12.997]  Expanding on that.
[01:13:14.013 --> 01:13:21.678]  I mean, you track all this at LifeSite News, but it doesn't make national news, but every day Antifa is attacking a pregnancy center.
[01:13:22.139 --> 01:13:23.780]  Every day they're attacking another church.
[01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:34.548]  And I see countless videos, even in D.C., of the left just randomly go pick a Catholic church and go inside for breaking stuff or screaming at people and just doing all this psychotic stuff.
[01:13:35.108 --> 01:13:36.509]  I mean, they literally hate God.
[01:13:36.549 --> 01:13:37.390]  They hate churches.
[01:13:37.630 --> 01:13:38.811]  They see it as the enemy.
[01:13:39.611 --> 01:13:43.412]  And even in jurisdictions where abortion is still legal, they go attack the police!
[01:13:43.912 --> 01:13:49.253]  I mean, they're just frothing with hatred, and the things they say, the things they do, we can't even put on air.
[01:13:49.713 --> 01:13:58.755]  I mean, just, it's unspeakable that they think this is going to sell everyone on the practice of killing children when they are our best advertising against them.
[01:13:58.955 --> 01:14:06.638]   I know I keep going back to that, but that's what you predicted would happen, that's what the Bible tells us would happen, that's why we know It's an amazing thing, you know.
[01:14:06.458 --> 01:14:10.458]  come, we'll see the biggest revival ever on earth.
[01:14:10.458 --> 01:14:15.137]   So yeah, the Antichrist wins for a season, but then that's actually the war that the
[01:14:15.137 --> 01:14:16.137]  devil loses.
[01:14:16.137 --> 01:14:19.778]  It's an amazing thing, you know.
[01:14:19.778 --> 01:14:25.337]   How is it that even when so many church leaders have really lost their way,
[01:14:25.482 --> 01:14:27.643]  They've basically gone into democratic camp.
[01:14:27.684 --> 01:14:31.046]  They hardly ever talk about abortion at all.
[01:14:31.106 --> 01:14:39.771]  They're, you know, they're trying to be on the uppity up with everything, not condemning LGBT anything, sometimes even participating in pride parades.
[01:14:40.031 --> 01:14:41.012]  Total insanity.
[01:14:41.952 --> 01:14:54.812]   And yet, the devil still sees the church as The enemy, and therefore gets the people whom he has in his clutches to go and protest in... Why are they protesting in Catholic churches?
[01:14:55.392 --> 01:15:02.495]  Why are women basically going nudes with slogans of the need for abortion in Catholic churches?
[01:15:03.476 --> 01:15:04.076]  What are they doing?
[01:15:04.096 --> 01:15:06.877]  It's disturbing as heck, for sure.
[01:15:07.578 --> 01:15:10.359]  But it's also demonstrating a couple things.
[01:15:10.599 --> 01:15:14.401]  One, for all the mushy middle... Sheesh, those...
[01:15:15.686 --> 01:15:17.067]  This is what we're fighting for.
[01:15:17.107 --> 01:15:20.148]  This is the right to, you know, women's choice.
[01:15:20.708 --> 01:15:22.069]  This is really evil.
[01:15:23.409 --> 01:15:33.613]  And then also, it convinces the people that, wait a minute, this is satanic and we need to wake up.
[01:15:34.513 --> 01:15:36.514]  And I think that's part of the effort here.
[01:15:36.794 --> 01:15:41.956]  The need to wake up the whole middle ground so they can see this for what it is.
[01:15:42.557 --> 01:15:43.497]  And that's happening now.
[01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:46.876]  And the media, of course, is playing its game.
[01:15:46.916 --> 01:15:47.997]  It's unwilling to cover.
[01:15:48.838 --> 01:15:56.404]  As of already last week, we had over 23 crisis pregnancy centers firebombed and vandalized and destroyed.
[01:15:57.873 --> 01:16:00.374]  And there's more of that happening every single day.
[01:16:00.414 --> 01:16:01.635]  Check out lifesitenews.com.
[01:16:01.655 --> 01:16:03.916]  You'll see it report by report by report.
[01:16:04.396 --> 01:16:08.197]  You're seeing the same thing at Catholic churches, at Christian churches, everywhere.
[01:16:08.217 --> 01:16:09.038]  It's accelerating.
[01:16:09.258 --> 01:16:10.138]  One more segment with us.
[01:16:10.158 --> 01:16:15.760]  We'll do about five more minutes in the next segment because I want to ask you, Big Pitcher, how this ties in with our other agendas and how we fight back against it.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.101]  Lifesitenews.com and Alex Jones, them fours.
[01:16:18.682 --> 01:16:26.305]  The last time John Henry was here with us, I told the story and I don't tell it because I'm proud of what I was involved in.
[01:16:27.324 --> 01:16:30.205]  I tell it because it's really a redemption story.
[01:16:30.805 --> 01:16:41.669]  I was brought up a Christian, and I had a relationship with God, but I was promiscuous as a teenager, and it felt very empty, and I was depressed over it, but I was still doing it.
[01:16:42.290 --> 01:16:50.673]  And my dad confronted me, and he said, I know you're out there getting girls pregnant and paying for abortions, because I get one of the girls over the house, and he talked to her.
[01:16:50.713 --> 01:16:51.193]  My mom did.
[01:16:52.453 --> 01:16:55.114]  And she was like 17 or 18, like I was.
[01:16:56.614 --> 01:16:58.614]  And my dad said, "Quit killing my grandkids."
[01:16:58.614 --> 01:17:04.934]   And he said, "You're going to wreck your life and wreck, you know, all these futures. Stop it."
[01:17:04.934 --> 01:17:11.335]   And I remember over the next year being convicted by that and then praying to God to forgive me.
[01:17:11.335 --> 01:17:15.574]  And it was like it was lifted off of me.
[01:17:15.739 --> 01:17:21.045]  Not even some subconscious guilt that I wasn't a happy person because of what I was involved in.
[01:17:21.065 --> 01:17:22.507]  And it doesn't mean I'm perfect today.
[01:17:22.827 --> 01:17:25.751]  The point is, I'm sure as hell not going out having abortions.
[01:17:28.027 --> 01:17:33.150]  But people, once they've had abortions, they harden their heart and they get more and more evil until they turn into these devils.
[01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:39.194]  And if I'd have told my dad, no, I'm not going to listen to you and kept doing that, I'd probably be a devil worshiper today.
[01:17:39.214 --> 01:17:40.875]  I mean, that's the path you're on.
[01:17:40.915 --> 01:17:41.775]  You've got to be on a path.
[01:17:41.795 --> 01:17:51.201]  And I'm telling people, you can break away from that path and you'll be so fulfilled and so empowered when you get on your knees and say, I repent, God, come into me, help me be good, put me on the right path.
[01:17:51.241 --> 01:17:52.082]  And it's a process.
[01:17:52.402 --> 01:17:55.424]  And then life is so much more fulfilling, so much more powerful.
[01:17:56.044 --> 01:18:00.986]  And these people are looking for power from Satan, but getting on your knees to Christ, that's what the real power is.
[01:18:01.006 --> 01:18:02.566]  And I wanted to get your view on that.
[01:18:02.586 --> 01:18:02.626]  No.
[01:18:03.986 --> 01:18:08.308]  Well, there's absolutely nothing truer than that.
[01:18:10.108 --> 01:18:15.490]  I, too, come from a very sinful past, involved in all sorts of very similar things.
[01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:25.153]  And what led me to this was, first of all, the recognition that this stuff is real, that the faith is real.
[01:18:25.808 --> 01:18:30.691]  In fact, it came out of the example of my dad, a daily mass, daily rosary Catholic.
[01:18:31.591 --> 01:18:44.217]  But it wasn't just his example of doing that, of spending all his life praying and gosh, I would come home from going to dance clubs at two in the morning, still be there praying at his bedside, sometimes falling asleep and kneeling, but sleeping on the bed.
[01:18:45.558 --> 01:18:50.921]  Really, what affected me even more than that was the persecution he received for being that way.
[01:18:51.821 --> 01:19:06.769]  His family members, myself and my siblings included, his own spouse, his family, his mom and his siblings, his colleagues at work, all calling him extreme or a freak, whatever, for being so religious.
[01:19:06.789 --> 01:19:07.610]  And you know what?
[01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:10.151]  He did it anyway, because he loved Christ.
[01:19:10.171 --> 01:19:11.832]  It was all about love.
[01:19:13.353 --> 01:19:19.416]  And you know that persecution he received for being faithful, that persecution he received for loving Christ above all else?
[01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:23.551]  was what told me it was real more than any words he could have said.
[01:19:24.471 --> 01:19:28.572]  And so I was able to embrace Christ myself, thanks to his example.
[01:19:28.592 --> 01:19:32.313]  And it gives you the greatest joy.
[01:19:33.073 --> 01:19:34.733]  It's an incredible thing.
[01:19:35.393 --> 01:19:41.895]  And it leads us to also recognize where the world is at and work for the world's redemption.
[01:19:41.935 --> 01:19:56.407]   Because all of these people, all of these people, even those on the other side, even the ones Performing the abortions are still children of God, and there's still a chance, until they die, to reach them.
[01:19:57.107 --> 01:20:00.569]  Perhaps we can't, but it doesn't stop us from trying.
[01:20:01.349 --> 01:20:06.492]  And so, we don't hate the people who are on the other side.
[01:20:06.912 --> 01:20:07.693]  We actually love them.
[01:20:07.893 --> 01:20:08.193]  That's right.
[01:20:08.233 --> 01:20:18.692]   We try and reach out to them, and that's why such a big movement is in the pro-life movement to reach out to those on the other side, those committing the abortions, assisting it.
[01:20:19.233 --> 01:20:22.476]  Who is Abby Johnson, one of the greatest pro-life leaders that exists in the world today?
[01:20:22.996 --> 01:20:23.477]  Who was she?
[01:20:23.877 --> 01:20:36.108]  She headed up Planned Parenthood clinics, and she knows the inside story, and now she runs an organization which seeks to convert and has converted many, many abortion workers, and it's so beautiful.
[01:20:37.134 --> 01:20:51.617]  Speaking to that, this Supreme Court is doing so many other great things, but the reason they're accelerating the censorship that's come out from some of the big tech leaks, as you know, is the gathering steam of the pro-life movement through free speech.
[01:20:51.737 --> 01:21:00.759]  And so, sure, they wanted to target Alex Jones and Donald Trump, but they're really going after the movement that is showing people, hey, these are really babies.
[01:21:01.687 --> 01:21:06.110]  This is really a satanic movement, and that's why this newest Supreme Court ruling is really good.
[01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:08.191]  A bunch more of these are going to come out in the next few days.
[01:21:08.711 --> 01:21:12.674]  Supreme Court says high school football coach can pray at the 50-yard line.
[01:21:13.094 --> 01:21:15.075]  Yes, we don't have a state-run religion.
[01:21:15.376 --> 01:21:25.162]  We have religious freedom in America, but I can hand out Christmas cards, or I can pray with people if they want to, or I, as a valedictorian, I wasn't a valedictorian, but I could say a prayer.
[01:21:26.002 --> 01:21:30.465]  But even when I was a senior in high school, 30-something years ago, they told us, don't say any prayers.
[01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:38.751]  If you say anything at your graduation, and the football team, you can't pray in public.
[01:21:38.771 --> 01:21:40.332]  The coach can't pray at the huddle.
[01:21:40.812 --> 01:21:41.653]  That is tyranny.
[01:21:41.713 --> 01:21:43.174]  We individually can do whatever we want.
[01:21:43.234 --> 01:21:44.175]  That's the First Amendment.
[01:21:44.415 --> 01:21:46.036]  The First Amendment defends that.
[01:21:46.076 --> 01:21:48.057]  And finally, the Supreme Court said, stop it.
[01:21:48.117 --> 01:21:48.938]  That's another big victory.
[01:21:50.422 --> 01:21:51.882]  It is, absolutely.
[01:21:51.962 --> 01:22:04.166]  Because this is the thing, if we remove Christ from the public square, obviously people who should be able to see the good example Christians are giving, that's withdrawn from them.
[01:22:04.826 --> 01:22:05.646]  That's crazy!
[01:22:06.487 --> 01:22:14.829]  We see all of the Mother Teresas of this world, if she's never allowed to express her faith, people just think, oh, what a great, wonderful woman.
[01:22:15.908 --> 01:22:16.749]  That's not what she wanted.
[01:22:17.009 --> 01:22:18.891]  She didn't want to be known as a great, wonderful woman.
[01:22:19.532 --> 01:22:29.321]  She wanted to be known as the hands and feet of Jesus, who are here to serve you and to love you and to reach out to you and invite you into an eternal relationship with Jesus.
[01:22:29.781 --> 01:22:30.762]  That's what it's all about.
[01:22:31.163 --> 01:22:35.987]  And if we're forbidden from doing that, it so deprives the world.
[01:22:36.027 --> 01:22:38.429]  So this is an amazing Supreme Court victory.
[01:22:39.571 --> 01:22:40.992]  And all of this is coming.
[01:22:42.313 --> 01:22:45.955]  To ahead, because the whole battle in life is all about this.
[01:22:46.116 --> 01:22:48.197]  It's actually all about eternal life.
[01:22:48.757 --> 01:22:54.781]  You know, we're here for even if we're here for 100 years, that is a blip on the screen compared to eternity.
[01:22:55.382 --> 01:23:00.065]  But in that blip, you're going to decide where you spend all of eternity.
[01:23:00.959 --> 01:23:06.282]  For millions and billions of years, in the shortest period of time, you've got to make that decision.
[01:23:06.643 --> 01:23:12.627]  And that's why the elites are all gathering to fight all the same agendas you mentioned before the break.
[01:23:13.127 --> 01:23:14.308]  How does all this work together?
[01:23:15.088 --> 01:23:15.428]  It does!
[01:23:16.029 --> 01:23:28.737]  Look, the same temptation that Satan always had, that he gave to Adam and Eve, to pride, to take power, to take the place of God, to be gods yourself, is given especially to the elites of this world.
[01:23:29.197 --> 01:23:30.178]  Take the power!
[01:23:31.107 --> 01:23:32.668]  And lord it over everyone.
[01:23:33.428 --> 01:23:34.248]  And what do they do?
[01:23:34.288 --> 01:23:42.270]  Well, they say, as you know, and you've said for over 20 years, the elites want to control the population of the world.
[01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:44.051]  They want to bring it down to, what, 500,000 or so.
[01:23:44.071 --> 01:23:45.091]  Excuse me, 500 million or so.
[01:23:45.111 --> 01:23:45.171]  Why?
[01:23:46.072 --> 01:23:46.452]  Why 500 million?
[01:23:46.472 --> 01:23:47.032]  Because it's controllable.
[01:23:51.434 --> 01:23:52.315]  And how do they get there?
[01:23:52.695 --> 01:23:54.356]  Well, population control.
[01:23:54.657 --> 01:23:56.258]  Well, how do we do population control?
[01:23:56.738 --> 01:23:57.799]  Well, contraception.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:07.067]  And the first thing that did was it decoupled the link between sexuality and procreation, which is absolutely essential why sexuality was created for procreation.
[01:24:07.327 --> 01:24:07.988]  Then what did they do?
[01:24:08.028 --> 01:24:11.771]  They destabilized marriage because they know that's the building block of society.
[01:24:12.171 --> 01:24:14.873]  And that is what keeps families grounded.
[01:24:14.893 --> 01:24:16.335]  And they don't want children grounded.
[01:24:16.355 --> 01:24:18.957]  They want them subsidiaries of the state, not of parents.
[01:24:19.257 --> 01:24:20.158]  So they attack marriage.
[01:24:21.121 --> 01:24:27.083]  And then they attack life itself, both in early term and late term abortion.
[01:24:27.823 --> 01:24:29.604]  And so all of this works together.
[01:24:29.764 --> 01:24:34.346]  And of course, homosexuality is sexuality apart from procreation as well.
[01:24:35.046 --> 01:24:38.327]  And so... And now they got the transgenderism to sterilize the children.
[01:24:38.647 --> 01:24:44.269]  It's all about decoupling us from God's order, making us basically domesticated corporate commodities.
[01:24:44.289 --> 01:24:46.550]  I mean, you can see the cold-bloodedness of this.
[01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:48.410]  Absolutely.
[01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:55.135]   And with COVID came A forwarding of this agenda, like, was very hard to see in the past.
[01:24:55.195 --> 01:25:02.664]  How could we fast forward this so fast to get us to a point where we'll all be subjected to a tyranny almost immediately?
[01:25:03.424 --> 01:25:03.785]  And it worked!
[01:25:04.577 --> 01:25:06.038]  They shut down churches.
[01:25:06.419 --> 01:25:07.880]  They made you stay in your home.
[01:25:08.181 --> 01:25:23.595]  They forced you to get an abortion tamed to jab under pain of losing your job, your livelihood, or being unable to see your parents dying in the hospital, and being unable to get treatment in a hospital for, you know, whatever disorder you may have, life-threatening, doesn't matter.
[01:25:24.356 --> 01:25:27.299]  You need to get this abortion tamed to jab, otherwise we're not going to treat you.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:28.680]  And it was done.
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:29.581]  It all happened.
[01:25:30.512 --> 01:25:30.872]  That's right.
[01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:31.612]  We're out of time.
[01:25:31.673 --> 01:25:35.374]  I want to close this, John Henry West and LifeSiteNews.com, with this.
[01:25:36.234 --> 01:25:55.603]  Even the Daily Mail, even the London Telegraph, even the Associated Press have run this video of scientists don't know why when the sperm makes it into the egg, there's an electrochemical explosion they can't even describe, because that's literally the new life, the new entity with a spiritual connection to the higher dimensions of God being activated, and scientists don't know why this happens.
[01:25:56.499 --> 01:26:01.281]  There it is, right there, an explosion of energy when those things come together.
[01:26:01.321 --> 01:26:02.322]  We are magic.
[01:26:02.402 --> 01:26:03.042]  God made us.
[01:26:03.382 --> 01:26:13.587]  We have a special destiny, and to deny that is to let these evil men that serve Satan become lords over us and pretend to be God when it's all a fraud.
[01:26:13.887 --> 01:26:14.507]  Thank you so much.
[01:26:14.547 --> 01:26:15.828]  Congratulations on your hard work.
[01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:17.248]  Please congratulate your whole team.
[01:26:17.488 --> 01:26:18.249]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:26:19.369 --> 01:26:20.109]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:26:20.169 --> 01:26:20.710]  God bless you.
[01:26:20.890 --> 01:26:21.310]  God bless you.
[01:26:22.355 --> 01:26:23.475]  That was a powerful interview.
[01:26:23.656 --> 01:26:26.977]  Okay, look, I got a ton of news across the board that all ties back together here.
[01:26:26.997 --> 01:26:28.377]  We're going to come back and we're going to cover it.
[01:26:28.737 --> 01:26:33.579]  I didn't plug any this hour, and we're, again, barely in the black right now, and we continue down this road.
[01:26:33.599 --> 01:26:34.860]  In another few months, we'll be back in the red.
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:36.800]  So, please go to InfoWareStore.com.
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:37.581]  We're doing important work.

[01:26:42.162 --> 01:26:44.583]  InfoWareStore.com or PrepareToday.com.
[01:26:44.623 --> 01:26:44.923]  Stay with us.
[01:26:44.943 --> 01:26:46.804]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:46.844 --> 01:26:49.925]  Some viewers may find the following video disturbing.
[01:26:49.945 --> 01:26:51.626]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[01:26:55.713 --> 01:26:56.274]  What's wrong, sir?
[01:26:56.294 --> 01:26:57.114]  You like killing babies?
[01:26:57.435 --> 01:26:58.275]  You love killing babies?
[01:26:58.616 --> 01:26:59.617]  I love killing babies.
[01:26:59.657 --> 01:27:00.938]  You love killing babies, huh?
[01:27:01.358 --> 01:27:02.319]  You love that, don't you?
[01:27:02.219 --> 01:27:03.219]  You love that.
[01:27:03.219 --> 01:27:32.219]  [music]
[01:27:32.219 --> 01:27:34.219]  Look at you!
[01:27:33.653 --> 01:27:35.653]  I love you!
[01:27:35.653 --> 01:27:43.653]  [cheering]
[01:27:43.653 --> 01:27:47.653]  He's the equivalent of... He must be having a hard time!
[01:27:47.653 --> 01:27:49.653]  [cheering]
[01:27:50.653 --> 01:27:56.653]  [music]
[01:27:56.653 --> 01:28:24.653]  [music]
[01:28:24.653 --> 01:28:26.653]  [cheering]
[01:28:26.653 --> 01:28:40.653]  [music]
[01:28:40.653 --> 01:28:42.653]  Hi!
[01:28:42.201 --> 01:28:43.042]  My choice!
[01:28:44.505 --> 01:28:51.505]  My choice! My choice! My choice! My choice! My choice!
[01:28:52.505 --> 01:28:54.505]  [Screaming]
[01:28:55.505 --> 01:28:57.505]  [Screaming]
[01:28:57.505 --> 01:29:03.505]  [Screaming]
[01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:05.505]  [Screaming]
[01:29:26.505 --> 01:29:33.505]  [Screaming]
[01:29:33.505 --> 01:29:37.505]  [Music]
[01:29:37.505 --> 01:29:43.505]  [Music]
[01:29:44.505 --> 01:29:52.505]   In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[01:29:52.539 --> 01:30:00.544]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshippers, maybe you can call the A-Team.
[01:30:03.265 --> 01:30:04.506]  How many did I adopt?
[01:30:04.706 --> 01:30:05.547]  I kill my kids!
[01:30:06.047 --> 01:30:07.288]  I kill my kids!
[01:30:09.431 --> 01:30:13.393]  There's no one fucking thing that's racist fucking male that doesn't stand for women's rights.
[01:30:13.814 --> 01:30:14.834]  Get the fuck out of here!
[01:30:15.214 --> 01:30:17.356]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[01:30:18.196 --> 01:30:19.017]  That's pretty cool, man.
[01:30:20.157 --> 01:30:23.859]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[01:30:23.939 --> 01:30:26.041]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[01:30:27.021 --> 01:30:27.802]  I don't think so.
[01:30:28.142 --> 01:30:29.362]  I don't have children!
[01:30:29.503 --> 01:30:31.364]  I fucking love faith!
[01:30:35.768 --> 01:30:38.109]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[01:30:38.129 --> 01:30:38.690]  I pay for them.
[01:30:38.730 --> 01:30:40.071]  I thought they said free.
[01:30:40.131 --> 01:30:42.672]  How many do you pay for them?
[01:30:42.792 --> 01:30:43.673]  Upwards of 50.
[01:30:43.733 --> 01:30:46.214]  Really?
[01:30:46.534 --> 01:30:48.215]  Oh yeah.
[01:30:48.235 --> 01:30:49.996]  Fuck you, you piece of shit!
[01:30:50.336 --> 01:30:52.137]  Bunch of misogynist motherfuckers!
[01:30:52.178 --> 01:30:54.339]  Take your male privilege somewhere else!
[01:30:54.399 --> 01:30:56.760]  Tava, you're being aggressive.
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.942]  I'm being aggressive.
[01:31:01.083 --> 01:31:05.083]  At least that's the guys that attacked Alex Jones.
[01:31:05.083 --> 01:31:18.083]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:31:18.083 --> 01:31:25.083]  [Music]
[01:31:25.083 --> 01:31:27.003]  (whooshing)
[01:31:27.122 --> 01:31:31.044]  And Ali Alexander had a big exclusive interview here with him.
[01:31:31.404 --> 01:31:40.369]  He'll be joining us next Sunday night to get into the Jan 6 investigation, all that's coming out of that, the witch hunt.
[01:31:40.988 --> 01:31:47.028]   He was just questioned by the federal grand jury on Friday in DC, but that's not why he's
[01:31:47.028 --> 01:31:48.028]  here.
[01:31:48.028 --> 01:31:52.427]   He is a well-known, really smart political analyst who I've been interviewing for six,
[01:31:52.427 --> 01:31:53.427]  seven, eight, nine years.
[01:31:53.427 --> 01:31:54.868]  I forget how long.
[01:31:54.868 --> 01:31:59.347]   And I said, "Please come on the show and talk about what Roe v. Wade means, what these other
[01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:04.388]   big rulings mean, the midterm revenge over the stolen election, 22 election analysis."
[01:32:04.104 --> 01:32:11.823]   analysis, RINO subverting red wave, 2022 midterm warning for patriots, 1 million votes for
[01:32:11.823 --> 01:32:17.604]   the GOP, seven states vote tomorrow, Mary Miller over Rodney Davis in Illinois.
[01:32:17.604 --> 01:32:20.163]  We got so much to cover with Ali Alexander.
[01:32:20.163 --> 01:32:28.003]   He's just like Infowars, persecuted, de-platformed, except at givesingo.com/alialexander and on
[01:32:28.003 --> 01:32:31.664]  Gab Truth Social Telegram at Ali Alexander.
[01:32:31.664 --> 01:32:34.143]  So be sure and check him out and support what he's doing.
[01:32:34.143 --> 01:32:36.624]  All right, Ali, you're always loaded for bear.
[01:32:36.624 --> 01:32:37.624]  Let's get right into it.
[01:32:37.624 --> 01:32:39.124]  There's so many subjects.
[01:32:39.124 --> 01:32:41.384]  What is your analysis of the current state of affairs?
[01:32:41.384 --> 01:32:46.264]   Well, look, you know, I think what's really interesting is that they claim that Joe Biden
[01:32:46.264 --> 01:32:48.944]  got 81 million votes.
[01:32:48.944 --> 01:32:51.064]  But you know, a few months into his presidency.
[01:32:51.423 --> 01:32:53.504]  Analysts were already predicting a red wave.
[01:32:53.765 --> 01:33:05.272]  Where was there any indication that if Joe Biden was the most popularly elected president in United States history, garnered more votes than Barack Obama, that he was somehow going to face a red wave?
[01:33:05.372 --> 01:33:09.935]  And so what's really been interesting is to see how this red wave was going to take shape.
[01:33:10.316 --> 01:33:19.882]  Because in 2010, you know, we had a red wave, but it was really an anti-establishment, conservative, libertarian wave against the Republican establishment.
[01:33:19.922 --> 01:33:21.063]  And that was huge.
[01:33:21.533 --> 01:33:26.476]  What's really interesting about this one is that we've got a popular former president in Trump.
[01:33:26.816 --> 01:33:28.917]  He's endorsing inside of primaries.
[01:33:29.478 --> 01:33:36.322]  And he's having a lot of success in open primaries, but not so much success against incumbents.
[01:33:36.382 --> 01:33:40.184]  And so what's really interesting is how this wave is shaping up.
[01:33:40.244 --> 01:33:49.650]  And we got data today that in 43 states, 1 million people have switched over to the Republican Party, whereas only 600,000 have switched over to the Democrat Party.
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:53.141]  Clearly, you know, where are these 81 million people?
[01:33:53.161 --> 01:33:54.002]  That's my question.
[01:33:55.623 --> 01:34:00.485]  Well, you're not supposed to question election integrity unless you're a Democrat.
[01:34:01.185 --> 01:34:05.147]  What is your handicapping or just far-out prediction?
[01:34:05.167 --> 01:34:06.948]  134 days, still pretty far out.
[01:34:07.468 --> 01:34:10.009]  What gut level, what do you think is about to go down with this midterm?
[01:34:10.309 --> 01:34:12.270]  I think they're trying to steal the whole thing from everybody again.
[01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:15.252]  They're already trying to outlaw the idea of questioning election fraud, you know.
[01:34:15.272 --> 01:34:17.593]  They're trying to put you and me in jail just for questioning it.
[01:34:18.979 --> 01:34:22.783]  Just for questioning it, look, I don't know what I believe about the Senate.
[01:34:22.843 --> 01:34:26.586]  I usually, like, make my Senate call in July or August.
[01:34:26.627 --> 01:34:28.288]  You can do it pretty much that early.
[01:34:28.628 --> 01:34:31.551]  The House races, you know, they can be really interesting.
[01:34:31.812 --> 01:34:39.139]  I remember in 2010, we were watching races the night of that no one thought was competitive that we were pulling like 15, 20 points outside of.
[01:34:40.816 --> 01:34:41.677]  We were winning those.
[01:34:41.757 --> 01:34:43.878]  One of those races was in North Carolina.
[01:34:44.259 --> 01:34:46.680]  Renee Elmer, she was a nurse, if you'll remember her.
[01:34:47.141 --> 01:34:59.630]  She then had an alleged affair with Kevin McCarthy, which prevented him from becoming Speaker, which is why Ryan, Paul Ryan became Speaker, you know, actually there, you know, after we took back the House.
[01:34:59.650 --> 01:35:01.172]  So that was really interesting history.
[01:35:01.432 --> 01:35:09.618]  And this is a little bit of the same where I actually believe that the Republican establishment and Kevin McCarthy, they're trying to temper the red wave.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.023]  I don't think that they want 100 seats.
[01:35:13.163 --> 01:35:15.365]  I don't think that they want 60 seats.
[01:35:15.786 --> 01:35:21.391]  I think Kevin McCarthy wants, you know, 30 seats because then he can control the caucus.
[01:35:21.431 --> 01:35:36.315]   But the more conservatives get elected, The more subjective he is to actually the House Freedom Caucus and our friends like Paul Gosar, MTG, Andy Biggs, and people who are really, you know, fighting for the America First agenda.
[01:35:36.335 --> 01:35:38.677]  So I actually think that Republicans are in on it.
[01:35:38.717 --> 01:35:42.601]  I tell my friends this, why isn't Kevin McCarthy in front of a gas station?
[01:35:43.101 --> 01:35:45.943]  Every Friday, every Monday during the press conference.
[01:35:46.003 --> 01:35:57.050]  I mean, this is something that pierces to the suburban voter, the people who voted against Republicans in 2018, but voted for Republicans allegedly in 2020, but left Trump off their ballot.
[01:35:57.090 --> 01:36:00.012]  I mean, it's a really strange voter that they're telling us exists.
[01:36:00.212 --> 01:36:05.033]   I don't believe they exist, but if they existed, Why isn't Kevin McCarthy in front of the gas station?
[01:36:05.033 --> 01:36:06.033]  You know, so...
[01:36:06.033 --> 01:36:09.993]   Well, Ollie, there's no doubt that the Republican establishment in the past managed power of
[01:36:09.993 --> 01:36:13.313]   the Democrats, and that right now they're trying to head off the populist movement that
[01:36:13.313 --> 01:36:15.354]  put Trump in that could unseat them.
[01:36:15.354 --> 01:36:16.354]  And they're very close.
[01:36:16.354 --> 01:36:23.354]   If we get 30, 40 people like MTG or Gozer in, it's game over, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:23.499 --> 01:36:28.301]  But if we just get 30, 40 neocons and a mix of rhinos, it'll be business as usual.
[01:36:28.321 --> 01:36:28.861]  You're absolutely right.
[01:36:29.161 --> 01:36:30.382]  They want their personal power.
[01:36:30.702 --> 01:36:32.822]  They want to be in power 20 years from now as the Speaker.
[01:36:33.263 --> 01:36:34.643]  They're trying to manage all this.
[01:36:34.743 --> 01:36:40.065]  But what they have to understand is the Democrats are trying to outlaw the Republican Party and have been demonizing them as well.
[01:36:40.345 --> 01:36:45.648]   They need to stop being corporate lawyers and Running the country into the ground.
[01:36:45.668 --> 01:36:49.172]  They need to have a real revolution peacefully and take this country back.
[01:36:49.192 --> 01:36:50.134]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:36:50.774 --> 01:36:52.476]  They should be trying to impeach Biden.
[01:36:52.757 --> 01:36:54.699]  It doesn't matter that they don't have the votes.
[01:36:55.019 --> 01:36:59.905]  The Democrats did that with Trump because it takes the political football away and makes it about open borders.
[01:37:00.848 --> 01:37:01.529]  No, they're not.
[01:37:01.829 --> 01:37:02.990]  And I was actually, when I was in D.C.
[01:37:02.850 --> 01:37:06.090]   Instead they give the football to the Democrats to have a January 6th show trial.
[01:37:06.090 --> 01:37:11.090]   So it's a no-brainer to be having impeachment votes and impeachment hearings.
[01:37:11.090 --> 01:37:16.490]   And it's a no-brainer because then it puts the focus massively back on Biden and how
[01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:17.490]  horrible he is.
[01:37:17.490 --> 01:37:20.130]  But no, they're not doing that, are they?
[01:37:20.130 --> 01:37:21.130]  No they're not.
[01:37:21.130 --> 01:37:26.090]   And I was actually, when I was in D.C. on Friday, I was talking with a chief of staff
[01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:28.889]  and an ally of the America First agenda.
[01:37:28.889 --> 01:37:33.610]   And I told him, conveyed to him that I support a fast impeachment of Joe Biden.
[01:37:33.982 --> 01:37:34.402]  Next year.
[01:37:34.422 --> 01:37:35.763]  I don't support a long one.
[01:37:35.803 --> 01:37:36.924]  I support a fast one.
[01:37:37.144 --> 01:37:39.285]  And let's impeach him for several things, right?
[01:37:39.325 --> 01:37:40.786]  It doesn't just have to be the border.
[01:37:41.167 --> 01:37:45.409]  It does need to include the due process abuses, as you articulated.
[01:37:45.669 --> 01:37:48.231]  They're trying to outlaw the Republican Party.
[01:37:48.731 --> 01:37:51.193]  And there's not enough conservative media focusing on this.
[01:37:51.233 --> 01:37:52.033]  I mean, think about this.
[01:37:52.333 --> 01:37:59.558]  They've subpoenaed the top organizers, the top activists in both the Tea Party and the election integrity movement in Michigan.
[01:38:00.117 --> 01:38:05.421]  They've arrested the leading gubernatorial candidate there against Gretchen Whitmore.
[01:38:05.641 --> 01:38:07.002]  They've rigged Michigan.
[01:38:07.063 --> 01:38:11.026]  I've told people my first forecast of 2024 is that we've lost it.
[01:38:11.266 --> 01:38:16.630]  We've officially lost it because they've shackled us down and we can't organize in Michigan.
[01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:23.856]  My sources are telling me and some of the information that I'm getting from my lawyers is that Arizona and Georgia are next.
[01:38:24.295 --> 01:38:32.879]  So they're actually stealing 2024 two years ahead of time by doing what they've done to you and me for the past year and a half.
[01:38:33.199 --> 01:38:46.086]  They're now spreading it out to about 50 or 60 different top activists in the states where we have to have complete organization, peaceful protesting, voter registration, you know, Trump rallies and all of that.
[01:38:46.486 --> 01:38:50.268]  And my fear is that Kevin McCarthy is actually in on it.
[01:38:50.608 --> 01:38:52.249]  And so I favor a fast impeachment.
[01:38:52.705 --> 01:38:56.369]  I favor a select committee to investigate this select committee.
[01:38:56.909 --> 01:39:02.255]  I favor giving the Oversight Judiciary and House Select Committee a limited subpoena power.
[01:39:02.735 --> 01:39:04.517]  And Kevin McCarthy needs to let them go.
[01:39:04.637 --> 01:39:10.143]  Jim Jordan, Jim Banks, Daryl Issa, they know what they're doing when they're managing these type of operations.
[01:39:10.443 --> 01:39:13.006]  He needs to release an America First promise.
[01:39:13.717 --> 01:39:17.798]  This summer and tell us what is the agenda for 2023?
[01:39:18.138 --> 01:39:20.579]  And I don't think that the establishment is ready to do that.
[01:39:20.679 --> 01:39:30.622]  I think they're ready to do more of what we saw in the Senate where we had Republicans crossing over to outlaw guns while the Supreme Court is saying this is actually a fundamental right.
[01:39:30.962 --> 01:39:33.223]  I mean, it's it's insane what we're seeing.
[01:39:33.243 --> 01:39:39.985]  We're seeing the Hegelian dialectic management of the decline in real time, but they've really taken off.
[01:39:40.045 --> 01:39:41.885]  You know, I don't know the facade of it all.
[01:39:41.966 --> 01:39:43.426]  The Republicans are in on the game.
[01:39:44.502 --> 01:39:52.097]  That's right, the establishment Republicans that want to be the functionaries, want to keep their positions, they are trying to manage the populist movement over the edge of a cliff.
[01:39:53.713 --> 01:40:01.121]  If the globalists continue down this road, as you said, this managed decline, it has a bottom that's going to drop out, and that's going to destroy their own future.
[01:40:01.181 --> 01:40:05.685]  But they were put in power because they follow orders by their corporate controllers.
[01:40:05.725 --> 01:40:08.648]  And we know the Republicans have been bought off by big tech.
[01:40:08.928 --> 01:40:12.672]  That's why they wouldn't stop the censorship, and that's why Trump had the election stolen from him.
[01:40:12.912 --> 01:40:15.275]  So they continue to purposely throw the fight.
[01:40:17.054 --> 01:40:18.194]  It's absolutely right.
[01:40:18.254 --> 01:40:19.034]  I mean, think about this.
[01:40:19.275 --> 01:40:31.817]  If you are facing massive inflation, massive gas prices, food prices through the roof, energy prices through the rails, a housing crisis that is in a complete bubble, why would you send money to Ukraine?
[01:40:32.097 --> 01:40:33.818]  Except for they're in on it.
[01:40:34.038 --> 01:40:36.038]  They are okay with the coming crash.
[01:40:36.338 --> 01:40:38.919]  They think that they can set up another new deal.
[01:40:39.179 --> 01:40:44.080]  And that's why they gave us Biden, is that they want a new deal and they want Biden to usher that in.
[01:40:44.668 --> 01:40:46.429]  And take the blame for any problems.
[01:40:46.549 --> 01:40:47.009]  Absolutely.
[01:40:47.469 --> 01:40:48.729]  Ali Alexander is our guest.
[01:40:48.749 --> 01:40:52.950]  We've got a bunch of other analysis to do on other Supreme Court rulings that are coming up.
[01:40:53.590 --> 01:40:56.951]  What's going to happen in the aftermath of this Roe v. Wade being overturned?
[01:40:57.311 --> 01:40:58.152]  What's Trump's role?
[01:40:58.172 --> 01:40:59.492]  What's Ron DeSantis' role?
[01:40:59.892 --> 01:41:01.853]  So many angles to cover with Ali Alexander.
[01:41:02.533 --> 01:41:04.613]  Analysis of 2022 and beyond, straight ahead.
[01:41:05.214 --> 01:41:13.296]  Oh, I got 100 questions for Ali Alexander because I knew him as one of the most respected young political analysts out there in the last 10 years and I got to know him.
[01:41:14.056 --> 01:41:17.097]  Not just on the show over the years, but especially in the 2020 insanity.
[01:41:18.198 --> 01:41:24.620]  And now, obviously, we're both being persecuted together because we were there trying to stop people entering the Capitol, and they're still trying to put us in jail.
[01:41:25.281 --> 01:41:25.981]  It's just crazy.
[01:41:26.001 --> 01:41:29.542]  And he was just in the grand jury, and he's not ready to talk about that till Sunday.
[01:41:29.983 --> 01:41:31.063]  But he told me quite a bit about it.
[01:41:31.103 --> 01:41:33.084]  Pretty amazing, to say the least.
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:41.483]  I've got a thousand questions and you've got a bunch of races to look at and what's coming up in the midterms.
[01:41:41.503 --> 01:41:42.844]  But then I've got big questions for you.
[01:41:43.484 --> 01:41:47.427]  Or 35,000 foot questions about what do you make of the push for new lockdowns?
[01:41:47.587 --> 01:41:48.828]  What do you think is going to happen with...
[01:41:49.827 --> 01:41:55.109]  These pride parades that are basically pedophile events because I don't dislike gay people.
[01:41:55.229 --> 01:41:57.951]  I don't dislike any of people that are adults and whatever.
[01:41:57.991 --> 01:42:01.172]  But when they're bringing kids to things, there's naked men running around the street.
[01:42:01.532 --> 01:42:02.613]  I mean, this is pedophilic.
[01:42:02.933 --> 01:42:04.093]  What are the Democrats thinking?
[01:42:04.133 --> 01:42:05.274]  Why are they going so nuts?
[01:42:05.294 --> 01:42:06.995]  I want to get your take on that as well.
[01:42:07.015 --> 01:42:09.956]  I want to get your take on Trump, the Santas, all of it.
[01:42:09.996 --> 01:42:11.677]  But Roe v. Wade ruling.
[01:42:12.762 --> 01:42:14.063]  You gotta give Trump credit.
[01:42:14.103 --> 01:42:14.924]  I know you're a big supporter.
[01:42:14.944 --> 01:42:15.525]  I'm a big supporter.
[01:42:15.605 --> 01:42:21.410]  I'm upset about the vaccine, the rest of it, but Donald Trump's supreme legacy is he said, I'll overturn it.
[01:42:21.911 --> 01:42:22.491]  He did it.
[01:42:22.912 --> 01:42:24.213]  He gets a lot of the credit.
[01:42:24.653 --> 01:42:27.176]  I mean, that is, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:42:27.516 --> 01:42:30.859]  And that right there is the biggest WN for Trump, in my view.
[01:42:30.879 --> 01:42:32.120]  What do you say, Ali Alexander?
[01:42:33.482 --> 01:42:34.002]  I agree.
[01:42:34.082 --> 01:42:42.424]   You know, when I, when I was in high school and I thought I was a Democrat, I thought I was a conservative Democrat and my debate coach said, no, I think you're a Republican.
[01:42:42.444 --> 01:42:45.467]  Why did you spend this spring break doing some research?
[01:42:45.547 --> 01:42:50.210]  And I, I came back from spring break and I said, you know, oh my gosh, I'm a Republican.
[01:42:50.230 --> 01:42:52.272]  I think I'm a conservative Republican.
[01:42:52.332 --> 01:42:57.116]  And she just laughed because, you know, she knew my values and knew that that was about accurate.
[01:42:57.576 --> 01:43:00.699]  And I remember in that, that my top issue was life.
[01:43:01.445 --> 01:43:03.627]  That life exceeded politics.
[01:43:03.687 --> 01:43:05.248]  It wasn't even a question.
[01:43:05.508 --> 01:43:08.051]  I wondered why people could justify abortion.
[01:43:08.331 --> 01:43:11.894]  You never find a child who thinks abortion is natural.
[01:43:12.474 --> 01:43:15.096]  And so for me, this is a day I never thought, right?
[01:43:15.116 --> 01:43:19.420]  We all fought for this day, but none of us thought it was going to actually happen.
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:21.842]  And I thought that it would never happen.
[01:43:21.882 --> 01:43:41.459]   So to watch the court, A poorly written decision with poor logic and poor science and poor reasoning that derives from a butchered understanding of the 14th Amendment that's really for black people, but it's become a shopping cart for the progressive left and the Marxist left and the Bolshevik left.
[01:43:42.720 --> 01:43:49.385]  It really restores some of your faith in the system that if you want abortion, you're going to have to pass it at the state level.
[01:43:49.835 --> 01:43:52.699]  Or if you want something else, you're going to have to pass it at the congressional level.
[01:43:52.939 --> 01:43:56.123]  Why have Democrats never passed abortion at the federal level?
[01:43:56.423 --> 01:43:58.185]  Because it's never been popular.
[01:43:58.445 --> 01:44:00.448]  Because they've always had to trick the public.
[01:44:00.748 --> 01:44:08.057]  You know, because there's only so much of the country that's liberal, and then they need those moderate Democrats or those conservative Democrats to get any type of majority.
[01:44:08.477 --> 01:44:11.959]  So, I mean, what we're seeing is an accurate portrayal of the country.
[01:44:11.999 --> 01:44:14.400]  And I applaud this court and I applaud Donald Trump.
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:17.422]  He is the man that God anointed for this position.
[01:44:17.462 --> 01:44:20.603]  We got three justices on the court that held the line.
[01:44:20.883 --> 01:44:23.645]  We can see that Chief Justice Roberts was actually the mistake.
[01:44:24.105 --> 01:44:27.386]  And, you know, God will give you what you need, not what you want.
[01:44:27.466 --> 01:44:34.670]  And I credit President Trump for crediting God and then saying that this is due to decades of answers of prayer.
[01:44:35.154 --> 01:44:41.640]  And so I think that this is Trump lining himself to, frankly, run better than he ran in 2016.
[01:44:41.740 --> 01:44:48.166]  And he'll align those metaphysical forces, you know, in his favor because we're going to really be up against it.
[01:44:48.206 --> 01:44:50.067]  So huge shout out to this court.
[01:44:50.268 --> 01:44:51.669]  And I want to point this out, Alex.
[01:44:52.438 --> 01:44:56.480]  The court had a string of Christian victories, not Republican victories.
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:58.821]  These are deeply Christian victories.
[01:44:59.201 --> 01:45:13.766]  And so whether it's the religious funding, the case out of Maine, or whether it's the football coach who was praying at the 50-yard line after games and the school district came down hard on him, or it's overturning Roe and Casey with this Dobbs decision.
[01:45:14.187 --> 01:45:17.408]  A huge shout out to the Christians who stood alone.
[01:45:17.930 --> 01:45:22.471]  Who didn't have Republican Party backing and simply just said, I'm going to do the right thing.
[01:45:22.731 --> 01:45:24.752]  And I think that this is a testament of our time.
[01:45:25.252 --> 01:45:27.333]  You know, we look at the election integrity issue.
[01:45:27.513 --> 01:45:29.253]  It's an 85% issue, Alex.
[01:45:29.533 --> 01:45:31.474]  And we led the way in a very peaceful way.
[01:45:31.854 --> 01:45:35.655]  You know, 500 rallies across the country, all without a police report.
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:44.263]  And yet, you know, you can't find that in conservative media that's propped up by Facebook or YouTube or subsidized, you know, by CNN.
[01:45:44.643 --> 01:45:47.544]  And so... And let's expand on that, Ollie.
[01:45:47.945 --> 01:45:48.925]  Let's expand on that.
[01:45:50.285 --> 01:45:55.848]  These victories for free speech, all these victories, are just further enraging the left.
[01:45:56.308 --> 01:45:59.829]  What do you expect them to do next in the face of this?
[01:45:59.889 --> 01:46:07.494]   And why do you think the court suddenly After these years of really not doing the right thing, suddenly, maybe it's the left threatening them more?
[01:46:07.834 --> 01:46:10.116]  Maybe it's seeing the accelerated decline of the country?
[01:46:11.597 --> 01:46:22.005]  Well, you know, Alex, I'm going to say something crazy, but, you know, this is my kind of four-dimensional analysis of the issue, is that we are watching the implosion of our country.
[01:46:22.766 --> 01:46:28.630]  And you can never, and you and I have talked about this, especially on your air, about inversion.
[01:46:29.050 --> 01:46:31.052]  Well, this is implosion.
[01:46:31.462 --> 01:46:36.066]  They're going to give us some of what we want in order to make the left irate.
[01:46:36.446 --> 01:46:40.349]  And then they're going to give the left some of what they want in order to make us irate.
[01:46:40.609 --> 01:46:42.030]  OK, so that's two dimensions.
[01:46:42.431 --> 01:46:46.234]  Where you get four dimensions is then you add the inversion.
[01:46:46.534 --> 01:46:52.419]  So, for example, they give them drag your kids to Pride in Dallas.
[01:46:52.898 --> 01:47:01.181]  Where, you know, Taylor Hanson came and we, you know, he came on Clubhouse and I interviewed him and he told me things that, you know, the conservative media didn't even report.
[01:47:01.562 --> 01:47:04.563]  That there was alcohol served from 11 to 2 p.m.
[01:47:04.583 --> 01:47:05.743]  That there were children at the bar.
[01:47:05.763 --> 01:47:06.924]  That there were children crying.
[01:47:07.224 --> 01:47:12.606]  That there wasn't just that sign that said if you lick it, you own it.
[01:47:12.666 --> 01:47:16.307]  There was a sign that said something about licking it, but there was another sign that said if you lick it, you own it.
[01:47:16.788 --> 01:47:19.995]   So, I mean, So that's a way of making us irate.
[01:47:20.296 --> 01:47:23.396]  The Roe decision is a way of making them irate.
[01:47:23.616 --> 01:47:28.177]  But the inversion is to make sure that liberals are illiberal.
[01:47:28.677 --> 01:47:35.559]  And the inversion on our side is to turn the military against itself through the forced vaccination.
[01:47:35.599 --> 01:47:39.840]  So you can really see that our country is facing an existential crisis.
[01:47:40.837 --> 01:47:44.518]  And they're convinced, the globalists, that we won't be able to solve it.
[01:47:44.838 --> 01:47:55.221]  So I'm not sure that either through a supernatural spiritual dark force or through globalist temporal planning, we are being demolished.
[01:47:55.581 --> 01:48:01.262]  This is a controlled demolition in four different aspects, in a quadrant type aspect.
[01:48:01.302 --> 01:48:03.643]  And so that's what I really think truthfully is happening.
[01:48:04.625 --> 01:48:07.246]  Well, I agree that that's what Satan wants to do.
[01:48:07.726 --> 01:48:12.607]  But we're bringing real activism and a real awakening to the table that has forced them into this position.
[01:48:12.687 --> 01:48:16.488]  So they're going to try to have a collapse, which they can pose as a savior's over.
[01:48:16.948 --> 01:48:18.748]  But I believe that's going to blow up in their face.
[01:48:18.788 --> 01:48:22.089]  And in the end, this is going to be a big defeat for the New World Order.
[01:48:22.389 --> 01:48:23.289]  So take a long time.
[01:48:23.309 --> 01:48:26.290]  But I believe, Ollie, we are starting to hit bottom.
[01:48:28.931 --> 01:48:29.891]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:48:29.971 --> 01:48:32.192]  And I want to say that miracles happen.
[01:48:32.432 --> 01:48:38.815]  And miracles happen when God's people are obedient, you know, and we turn away from some of that stupid stuff that we've been doing.
[01:48:38.855 --> 01:48:40.496]  And so I've done that in my life.
[01:48:40.556 --> 01:48:42.156]  I hope other people are doing that in their life.
[01:48:42.196 --> 01:48:49.059]  And we should prepare a way for a miracle, because frankly, that's what we're going to need if we're going to take country back in 2022 and 2024.
[01:48:49.499 --> 01:48:54.521]  And we're going to have to hold the Republicans accountable to our conservative principle.
[01:48:55.405 --> 01:49:02.929]  I'll tell you this, if they're parading kids with naked men through the streets of major cities, what will they be doing in a year?
[01:49:02.969 --> 01:49:04.570]  They'll be having sex with them on TV!
[01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:06.591]  Heaven forbid.
[01:49:07.991 --> 01:49:09.732]  Alright, Ali Alexander is our guest.
[01:49:10.313 --> 01:49:12.914]  We're going to come back and talk about Trump vs. DeSantis straight ahead.
[01:49:13.374 --> 01:49:15.635]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[01:49:16.956 --> 01:49:18.737]  Ladies and gentlemen, I truly do love you.
[01:49:18.757 --> 01:49:21.178]  Because I have empathy, I know you have empathy as well.
[01:49:21.678 --> 01:49:24.300]  If you're not doing well, I don't feel good.
[01:49:25.273 --> 01:49:29.095]  The globalists want to hurt you, they want to hurt me, and we're not going to let them do it.
[01:49:30.296 --> 01:49:31.497]  It's gone on too long.
[01:49:32.117 --> 01:49:32.998]  I know you want to fight.
[01:49:33.378 --> 01:49:34.259]  I know you want to win.
[01:49:34.339 --> 01:49:35.099]  You're just like me.
[01:49:35.119 --> 01:49:39.182]  I'm going to make this announcement because I need to, then we'll go back to Ali Alexander.
[01:49:41.803 --> 01:49:52.270]  We have nice little bookkeeping accounting here, good people, but with inflation and the problems and all the things that came in, we brought in several outside accounting firms.
[01:49:52.947 --> 01:49:56.388]  And had them do projections and analysis with the things that are going on.
[01:49:56.408 --> 01:49:59.690]  And they finally got back with the numbers last week.
[01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:12.614]  If we weren't given $9 million in Bitcoin donations two months ago, which I dumped half of it, thank God, and got it at like $39, kept back the rest and then lost $2 million of it.
[01:50:13.034 --> 01:50:14.715]  So $9 million became $7 million.
[01:50:16.176 --> 01:50:22.772]   If we hadn't been given that donation, I've already sold almost everything I've got.
[01:50:23.313 --> 01:50:24.753]  I could sell my cars, everything.
[01:50:24.814 --> 01:50:25.754]  It wouldn't run us for a month.
[01:50:26.475 --> 01:50:37.662]  Whoever did that, and I don't know who you are, whoever did that, you saved Infowars at least for the foreseeable four or five months.
[01:50:38.925 --> 01:50:49.150]  That said, we took two million dollars of the money, which it turned out we didn't, we have made the order last week, we didn't have money to buy the product because of supply chain breakdowns that happened previously.
[01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:54.353]  We didn't get enough product in to make the quota for what we had to sell, so we got in a jam.
[01:50:54.653 --> 01:50:59.255]  We got new awesome manufacturers, a bunch of products have been out for over eight, nine months.
[01:50:59.295 --> 01:51:01.496]  I'll be back in, looks like in about a month.
[01:51:01.556 --> 01:51:02.537]  DNA force, you name it.
[01:51:03.337 --> 01:51:04.458]  And that'll pull us out of this.
[01:51:05.635 --> 01:51:07.377]  But it was worse.
[01:51:07.477 --> 01:51:09.439]  I was telling you we had a $2-$3 million underage.
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:13.263]  We had a $6 million underage.
[01:51:13.924 --> 01:51:16.786]  I have hard accounting on this now.
[01:51:18.048 --> 01:51:18.909]  And it's insane.
[01:51:19.169 --> 01:51:28.719]  Literally the exact amount of money we needed to pay off the previous bills, get up to speed, and then order enough product to project out to be barely in the black through this year.
[01:51:30.655 --> 01:51:31.076]  It happens.
[01:51:31.116 --> 01:51:32.597]  So thank you, whoever you are.
[01:51:33.218 --> 01:51:36.602]  But all the little donations and all the product purchases without you, we wouldn't be here either.
[01:51:36.942 --> 01:51:44.010]  So whether you bought a tube of toothpaste, all natural, fluoride-free, or whether you bought a t-shirt or a book, I salute you.
[01:51:44.951 --> 01:51:46.753]  But please go to mfullworksstore.com.
[01:51:46.853 --> 01:51:47.554]  Here's the problem.
[01:51:47.755 --> 01:51:49.597]  Most of the best-selling products are gone.
[01:51:51.604 --> 01:51:53.025]  And so that's why we're having a problem.
[01:51:53.065 --> 01:51:56.926]  So we've got to make it up with t-shirt sales, with whatever products we've got left.
[01:51:56.946 --> 01:52:02.088]  A lot of the great products are still there, but we're running out of those, having to offer them at sale price to move them.
[01:52:02.148 --> 01:52:05.750]  So go to InfoWareStore.com today, buy a product.
[01:52:06.450 --> 01:52:07.191]  It's a great product.
[01:52:07.251 --> 01:52:08.111]  It makes your life better.
[01:52:08.691 --> 01:52:15.874]  And go to PrepareToday.com, which is where we're now selling all the storable food at the lowest, highest quality prices in stock, ready to ship.

[01:52:39.453 --> 01:52:43.774]   put in jail for no reason for helping organize the Stop the Steal and stand up for all of
[01:52:43.774 --> 01:52:44.774]  our rights.
[01:52:44.873 --> 01:52:46.234]  He's been in front of the committee.
[01:52:46.794 --> 01:52:48.896]  I took the fifth, because I mean, I know how dangerous they are.
[01:52:49.576 --> 01:52:52.638]  He had the huevos to go in the lion's den and do it, to face Goliath.
[01:52:52.898 --> 01:52:58.701]  He went in front of the grand jury, and he told the truth, despite all the persecution, put his ass on the line.
[01:52:59.121 --> 01:53:00.522]  So everybody should support this man.
[01:53:00.622 --> 01:53:03.864]  GiveSendGo.com forward slash Ali Alexander.
[01:53:05.947 --> 01:53:06.327]  Proven.
[01:53:06.387 --> 01:53:07.008]  Battle-hardened.
[01:53:07.028 --> 01:53:09.030]  You don't know who somebody is, so you're in the trenches with him.
[01:53:09.070 --> 01:53:12.193]  I've been in the trenches with this guy for two years, at least.
[01:53:12.574 --> 01:53:17.138]  So Ali, continuing, everybody wants to talk about this, so do I. I'm very torn.
[01:53:17.218 --> 01:53:18.159]  I love DeSantis.
[01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:20.501]  He's really done an amazing job.
[01:53:20.862 --> 01:53:22.924]  So eloquent, so smart, so on target.
[01:53:23.344 --> 01:53:24.986]  Way ahead of Trump on the vaccine issue.
[01:53:25.366 --> 01:53:31.850]   Trump gets the Super touchdown in sudden-death overtime, what he pledged to do with Roe v. Wade.
[01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:36.912]  I am really in a paradox here of not knowing who I want to back.
[01:53:36.952 --> 01:53:38.733]  I think that will materialize as time goes on.
[01:53:38.753 --> 01:53:39.934]  I know Trump isn't intending to run.
[01:53:39.954 --> 01:53:41.274]  I can tell you, folks, he is running.
[01:53:41.474 --> 01:53:43.515]  He'll announce within, you know, probably six months to a year.
[01:53:43.535 --> 01:53:46.056]  Probably right after the midterms is where it is.
[01:53:46.077 --> 01:53:48.958]  So, Ollie, with all your inside baseball, what do you think is going on here with those two?
[01:53:50.498 --> 01:53:55.981]  Yeah, it is really interesting because DeSantis is clearly keeping his options open.
[01:53:56.820 --> 01:54:13.134]  You know, with someone polling as high in his approval rating within the GOP as Trump, which, you know, I have to remind people, is the most high that any Republican nominee, any Democrat nominee, or any president has polled within his own party is President Trump.
[01:54:13.534 --> 01:54:17.457]  Trump has reshaped some of the political science in the modern ear.
[01:54:17.838 --> 01:54:30.741]   And that's why, you know, when I'm talking about the stolen election, I'm like, look, You see on TV, Lincoln Project, what you have to understand is that they are the smallest dissenting force that any nominee or any president has ever faced.
[01:54:31.081 --> 01:54:31.501]  Period.
[01:54:31.761 --> 01:54:33.843]  So where did the magic voters come from?
[01:54:34.144 --> 01:54:43.692]  Especially if Trump increased his votes with gays, Muslims, blacks, Hispanics, and we supposedly then lost white men.
[01:54:43.912 --> 01:54:44.593]  Give me a break.
[01:54:44.613 --> 01:54:49.477]  But I don't want to revisit 2020 as much as I want to say is I want to relitigate.
[01:54:49.997 --> 01:54:50.318]  Uh, 2020 and 2024.
[01:54:53.118 --> 01:54:59.722]  I want the American people to see with their own eyes that the Democrats could not ever possibly get $81 million.
[01:55:00.002 --> 01:55:03.124]  They couldn't get $71 million if they wanted, okay?
[01:55:03.364 --> 01:55:09.347]  They made up so many votes, in my opinion, that the fraud needs to be exposed.
[01:55:09.387 --> 01:55:18.653]  But what I think is dark and nefarious is again, again, again, there's an implosionary inversion happening within our party.
[01:55:18.973 --> 01:55:21.975]  The deep state is trying to lock up all the Trump support.
[01:55:23.356 --> 01:55:36.125]  Criminally indict Trump or put, you know, the air of misdeed around him, have legal challenges to his name on the ballot in select states, and then say, well, conservatives, why don't you choose DeSantis?
[01:55:36.545 --> 01:55:39.087]  So, you know, I love what Governor DeSantis is doing.
[01:55:39.468 --> 01:55:44.011]  After all, I did stop the seal in 2018 to protect his seat and Rick Scott's seat.
[01:55:44.231 --> 01:55:47.994]  Unfortunately, we lost the Ag Commissioner race there.
[01:55:48.547 --> 01:55:59.260]  Um, but, but at the end of the day, I, you know, I gotta support Trump, but the great thing about this pressure, right, that's building behind DeSantis is that it makes Trump a better candidate.
[01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:10.294]   So, you know, I, I, I too am in this paradox where, you know, I'm, I'm kind of cheering for both, but, you know, if, if, If the primary election was held today, I'd vote for Trump.
[01:56:10.334 --> 01:56:11.055]  Trump would win.
[01:56:10.875 --> 01:56:13.635]  But DeSantis is making Trump a better candidate.
[01:56:13.635 --> 01:56:16.634]  Ali Alexander, that is the most perfect analysis I've heard.
[01:56:16.634 --> 01:56:22.515]   DeSantis keeps Trump young, makes him more hardcore populist, keeps him true to the populist
[01:56:22.515 --> 01:56:25.194]   message because the media is like, "This is a Trump message that's winning."
[01:56:25.194 --> 01:56:31.114]   No, it's a populist, Tea Party, pro-America, Christian message that Trump adopted.
[01:56:31.114 --> 01:56:32.194]  DeSantis as well.
[01:56:32.755 --> 01:56:33.855]  And I admire both men.
[01:56:33.875 --> 01:56:35.256]  I think both men are good men.
[01:56:35.276 --> 01:56:36.197]  They both made mistakes.
[01:56:36.217 --> 01:56:36.917]  Nobody's perfect.
[01:56:37.357 --> 01:56:38.158]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:56:38.198 --> 01:56:39.878]  We got to dance with the guy that brung us.
[01:56:39.898 --> 01:56:43.900]  And I think you just convinced me, because even last week I'm like, maybe it's the Santas.
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:45.801]  And now I think Trump just edged ahead.
[01:56:45.821 --> 01:56:49.103]  And I think the Santas will keep Trump honest.
[01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:53.332]  Yeah, and you know, I have a couple swing issues.
[01:56:53.372 --> 01:56:58.915]  You know, DeSantis got better on the J6 victims, especially those guys who are still locked up there.
[01:56:59.816 --> 01:57:00.897]  You know, whatever.
[01:57:01.257 --> 01:57:06.300]  If DeSantis, you know, or Trump gets worse on the vaccine issue, then, you know, whatever.
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:07.882]  So there's a lot of wiggle room.
[01:57:08.062 --> 01:57:11.264]  And I will say, you know, the polling is starting to shift.
[01:57:11.784 --> 01:57:19.028]  So Donald Trump has to do something to, again, like you said, adopt this populist message that since 2008 we have been crying for.
[01:57:19.268 --> 01:57:20.669]  We said we don't want to moderate.
[01:57:21.049 --> 01:57:22.990]  We want this to be a Christian nation.
[01:57:23.030 --> 01:57:26.712]  We want this to be a conservative nation where your locality governs you.
[01:57:27.072 --> 01:57:30.654]  And that you can have community standards if you want to be a little liberal or a little conservative.
[01:57:30.734 --> 01:57:36.338]  Especially because we've seen the liberals want to conquer everything and put the most radical pedophiles and satanists in charge.
[01:57:36.618 --> 01:57:38.239]  They don't want to live in peace with us.
[01:57:38.499 --> 01:57:39.439]  They want to conquer us.
[01:57:39.459 --> 01:57:41.120]  They're not a party that wants to work with people.
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:42.501]  They want to outlaw us.
[01:57:42.801 --> 01:57:47.664]  So we've got to culturally and politically, non-violently, annihilate them.
[01:57:47.884 --> 01:57:51.486]  We have to extinct the Democratic Party because they're trying to extinct America.
[01:57:53.067 --> 01:57:55.969]  Yep, we've got to make liberalism great again by defeating them.
[01:57:56.877 --> 01:57:58.678]  Ollie, what do you want to hit in the final segment straight ahead?
[01:58:00.218 --> 01:58:03.560]  I think, you know, maybe we should talk about, well, I don't know.
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:04.540]  What should we talk about?
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:05.841]  I got a hundred things to talk about.
[01:58:05.881 --> 01:58:06.281]  Don't worry.
[01:58:06.301 --> 01:58:07.401]  I got a lot of questions for you.
[01:58:07.641 --> 01:58:08.522]  You're kicking butt, my friend.
[01:58:08.542 --> 01:58:09.122]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:09.902 --> 01:58:13.123]  Make no mistake, humanity is at a massive crossroads.
[01:58:14.284 --> 01:58:19.526]  In fact, things are so insane, it kind of feels weird to just be up here calmly talking about this.
[01:58:20.868 --> 01:58:22.708]  I mean, they're getting false flags ready.
[01:58:23.029 --> 01:58:24.029]  I didn't even cover this.
[01:58:24.689 --> 01:58:32.891]  I'll actually cover this after Ali leaves us and then hand the baton to Gerald Cilente that's coming up, but we talk about news and information overload.
[01:58:33.891 --> 01:58:41.973]  Project Veritas caught Democrat Party operatives talking about infiltrating the Republican Party to then commit crimes and blame them.
[01:58:46.434 --> 01:58:51.768]   I mean, ladies and gentlemen, They're talking about sleeper cells.
[01:58:53.149 --> 01:58:55.130]  This has been going on a long time, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:56.291 --> 01:59:02.435]  You don't really think those white supremacist groups running around hauling out of the backs of U-Haul trucks are real, right?
[01:59:06.858 --> 01:59:08.460]  I'm sorry, it's just unbelievable.
[01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:16.562]   Ali Alexander, on your radar screen, How can the deep state grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[01:59:16.962 --> 01:59:18.743]  What's the rabbit they're going to try to pull out of their hat?
[01:59:19.123 --> 01:59:23.705]  I see all the pre-programming, as you said, to label all of their opposition illegal.
[01:59:24.126 --> 01:59:25.746]  You and I first started saying that a year and a half ago.
[01:59:26.107 --> 01:59:29.028]  Tucker Carlson, gratefully, has realized that and picked it up.
[01:59:29.408 --> 01:59:30.489]  Some Republicans are getting it.
[01:59:30.529 --> 01:59:36.192]  I mean, the Democrats really are saying now they want to outlaw the Republican Party because they know they've lost the hearts and minds.
[01:59:36.612 --> 01:59:40.054]  So all they've got is election fraud and a civil emergency or a war.
[01:59:41.214 --> 01:59:50.842]  I mean, it's just insane that Biden could snap his fingers and turn on the Keystone Pipeline and lift the restrictions on drilling, and in about three months, prices would go back down to close to Trump.
[01:59:51.103 --> 01:59:53.825]  But he won't do it, and he says, oh, it's a transition.
[01:59:53.905 --> 01:59:56.927]  So, it's just crazy how they have their foot on our neck.
[01:59:57.507 --> 01:59:59.907]  And obviously there's going to be a giant landslide.
[01:59:59.907 --> 02:00:05.028]   All the former liberals I knew, almost all of them are now rabid populist, totally awake.
[02:00:05.028 --> 02:00:07.907]  I mean, this is a total political realignment in my view.
[02:00:07.907 --> 02:00:12.707]   A fourth turning's already happened, and I don't think their great reset's going to convince people.
[02:00:12.707 --> 02:00:19.427]   Yeah, you know, it's really interesting because, you know, in my reading of history,
[02:00:19.427 --> 02:00:25.268]   we're stuck in, like you said, this cyclical, I actually think that we're seeing the end of
[02:00:25.268 --> 02:00:28.386]  three cycles okay.
[02:00:26.409 --> 02:00:33.112]  So, we're probably at the end of a 100-year cycle, a 500-year cycle, and then potentially, you know, the big one... Perfectly said!
[02:00:33.132 --> 02:00:34.572]  We're at the end of a super cycle!
[02:00:35.833 --> 02:00:43.296]  Yeah, and... But the irony of it is that we're tortured by retarded oligarchs.
[02:00:43.806 --> 02:01:01.263]   So, in a lot of ways they have the plan from their predecessors, you know, and they use the star charts and they use these secret symbols and they're very aware of when they need to do things, but In as much as they've dumbed us down, they themselves have dumbed themselves down.
[02:01:01.323 --> 02:01:06.348]  And that's why you see the oligarchs are now Hunter Biden, you know, of all people, and Mitt Romney.
[02:01:06.528 --> 02:01:10.372]  And, you know, these are not the oligarchs that we should be afraid of.
[02:01:10.412 --> 02:01:14.936]  We're more afraid that they're actually going to mess things up and accidentally genocide all of us.
[02:01:15.316 --> 02:01:21.762]  And so it seems to me that, you know, is that God's way of making an opening for us?
[02:01:22.352 --> 02:01:31.437]  You know, that we, the spiritual people, are the ones that are defending conscience, and consent, and reason.
[02:01:31.657 --> 02:01:33.959]  You know, these things that liberals... And survival!
[02:01:33.979 --> 02:01:34.619]  And survival!
[02:01:34.999 --> 02:01:36.961]  A good, clean civilization's a good thing!
[02:01:37.081 --> 02:01:38.582]  It makes you secure and prosperous!
[02:01:39.962 --> 02:01:42.864]  It's true, you know, and yeah, we're the champions of science, you know?
[02:01:43.204 --> 02:01:45.085]  They're the champions of scientism.
[02:01:45.145 --> 02:01:50.613]   So, you know, in a lot of ways, you know, I don't know what's happening, but it is surreal.
[02:01:50.653 --> 02:01:55.728]  I was talking to a publisher last night and I said, I would call this period American Surrealism.
[02:01:56.175 --> 02:01:59.817]  You know, because, you know, no one's going to believe this in 50 years if we survive.
[02:01:59.877 --> 02:02:03.038]  No one's going to believe what we went through, what the names of people were.
[02:02:03.298 --> 02:02:10.482]  You know, a Supreme Court justice that said she couldn't, she wasn't a biologist or she couldn't affirm that she was a woman, but she was appointed to that position because she was a woman.
[02:02:10.822 --> 02:02:15.824]  They're considering Roe v. Wade because women, you know, it's just, it's just very, very surreal.
[02:02:16.024 --> 02:02:20.286]  I think what we're going through, and I think that's part of their game though, to make us crazy.
[02:02:20.306 --> 02:02:35.268]   And so that's always, I'm always telling people, drink water, work out, I mean, my family told me that about six months ago when I was working 15 hours a day.
[02:02:35.288 --> 02:02:43.492]  They said, son, you know this better than I do, but you've got to drink water, you've got to exercise, you've got to take supplements, you tell everybody this, you've got to go have some fun or you're going to go crazy.
[02:02:43.512 --> 02:02:49.835]  And now I'm feeling a lot better, doing great, lost 30-something pounds, I'm still fat, because I just realized, hey, you can't beat this alone.
[02:02:50.515 --> 02:02:53.237]  Give it to God, fight as hard as you can, but just give it to God.
[02:02:53.778 --> 02:02:55.779]  And I'm not perfect, Ollie.
[02:02:56.080 --> 02:03:02.845]  Yesterday, I was so upset watching pedophile marches around the country that I really, literally was choking on air.
[02:03:03.345 --> 02:03:09.831]  But when you hit that wall, you just gotta go to the quiet place, the most high that King David talked about, and just give it to God.
[02:03:11.332 --> 02:03:12.893]  It's so true, and I'll say that.
[02:03:13.093 --> 02:03:18.958]  When we spoke briefly yesterday, you sounded full of fight and full of joy.
[02:03:19.594 --> 02:03:20.895]  Uh, for the first time in months.
[02:03:21.616 --> 02:03:32.905]  And, uh, I had a friend, uh, comment last night when I was on the phone with her and she said, you know, it's so good to hear that you have your spirit back because for four weeks I've been dreading this grand jury gate that I did on Friday.
[02:03:32.925 --> 02:03:35.427]  And it was affecting my breathing patterns.
[02:03:35.467 --> 02:03:37.489]  It was affecting just how I approached everything.
[02:03:37.509 --> 02:03:40.352]  And, and finally it was like, God was saying it was okay.
[02:03:40.632 --> 02:03:43.074]  And then my flight was delayed six times.
[02:03:43.462 --> 02:03:48.144]  Which allowed me enough time to go to the Supreme Court and just walk amongst the liberals.
[02:03:48.764 --> 02:03:52.826]  And it was just, it was fascinating because here's what's not being reported on the news.
[02:03:53.166 --> 02:04:03.030]  There are fewer protesters outside the Supreme Court on the decision day than there were in May when the leak actually happened.
[02:04:03.050 --> 02:04:05.671]  So what's funny is the Democrats are losing momentum.
[02:04:05.691 --> 02:04:07.412]  They're losing steam, they're falling apart.
[02:04:07.472 --> 02:04:09.193]  And you're right, I felt good yesterday when we talked.
[02:04:09.713 --> 02:04:13.719]  And then I hadn't seen all the footage and I came in here and watched an hour of it and got depressed.
[02:04:14.039 --> 02:04:15.041]  How do you cope with that?
[02:04:15.441 --> 02:04:18.486]  Like looking at the abyss that Nietzsche talked about and not becoming the abyss?
[02:04:19.912 --> 02:04:31.515]  Yeah, well, like we just alluded to, look, we are souls in this temporal body, and we do have to take care of this temporal body because it affects our perspective, you know, how we align, you know, with God's will in the universe.
[02:04:31.556 --> 02:04:39.598]  And so, and I'm bad at that too, you know, you've got your cross to bury, like, I don't drink enough water, I don't work out, I don't eat enough.
[02:04:40.078 --> 02:04:42.860]  And so, you know, it's taking care of that physical body.
[02:04:43.160 --> 02:04:47.182]  It's surrounding yourself by people who can be encouraging in the Word.
[02:04:47.583 --> 02:04:50.765]  And people, you know, other Christians who will tell you, despair is a sin.
[02:04:51.185 --> 02:04:53.806]  You know, you can be sad, but you're not allowed to despair.
[02:04:53.947 --> 02:04:59.490]  Or, if you have something to offer the world, if God has given you a gift or a talent, you owe it to Him.
[02:04:59.846 --> 02:05:05.286]   to be in the fight. And you can't become the monster. So in the same ways that I don't want
[02:05:05.286 --> 02:05:10.086]   to cringe, say, "Remain peaceful, remain peaceful," I still owe it, if that's my true statement,
[02:05:10.086 --> 02:05:16.006]   to occasionally say that. But to not step off the gas, it was really great during the break,
[02:05:16.006 --> 02:05:20.725]   you know, to hear 1776 or, you know, what was said in the Travis letter,
[02:05:20.725 --> 02:05:23.286]  "Victory or death." We're just quoting historical documents.
[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:24.841]  We're not calling for violence.
[02:05:25.101 --> 02:05:31.389]  We're saying, find that spirit within you that enrages against immorality and what is wrong and what will hurt.
[02:05:31.789 --> 02:05:38.073]  The poor, and women, and widows the most, and fight like hell in the way that we've agreed to, and that's through politics.
[02:05:38.133 --> 02:05:45.098]  And that's definitely what they're scared of you, and Trump, and DeSantis, and everybody, and myself, and all these listeners is, we have the spirit of victory.
[02:05:45.358 --> 02:05:47.179]  We have the antidote to their poison.
[02:05:47.540 --> 02:05:53.143]  I mean, I go to a conservative rally, or I go, it can be black, white, people look healthy, their eyes are shining.
[02:05:53.524 --> 02:05:56.966]  You go to a leftist event, they look like some kind of demon sucked their soul out.
[02:05:57.426 --> 02:05:58.207]  I mean, it's scary.
[02:05:59.586 --> 02:06:01.889]  It literally is night and day.
[02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:11.998]  If you haven't protested in your life, and I know a lot of people in the post-election of 2020, that was some of their first protesting, but you have to go out and just observe this.
[02:06:12.298 --> 02:06:16.322]  Outside the Supreme Court, there was a gentleman just playing music.
[02:06:16.562 --> 02:06:20.226]  He looked like he was in his 60s, and he had a table, and he was playing music.
[02:06:20.486 --> 02:06:22.388]  He was just dropping the funk.
[02:06:23.178 --> 02:06:39.144]   And these women came and they just shrieked and yelled and these young guys came and they shrieked and they yelled and you could tell all of them were on the spectrum, you know, no offense, there's a lot of people on the spectrum now, but all of them are on the spectrum and they really were trying to imitate Violence.
[02:06:39.325 --> 02:06:40.585]  You know, it was very bizarre.
[02:06:40.806 --> 02:06:41.886]  And he's just smiling.
[02:06:42.267 --> 02:06:44.268]  And every time they would attack him, the U.S.
[02:06:44.308 --> 02:06:47.390]  Capitol Police would come over and get them away from him.
[02:06:47.690 --> 02:06:49.291]  And it never worked the other way.
[02:06:49.331 --> 02:06:55.295]  You'll never see a pro-lifer attack a pro-abortionist, you know, outside the Supreme Court.
[02:06:55.315 --> 02:06:56.536]  It's always the other way.
[02:06:56.856 --> 02:07:05.122]  And I just, I thought, we are looking at the people who say they're pro-science, pro-reason, pro-tolerance, be antithetical to all those things.
[02:07:05.182 --> 02:07:06.823]  They've been demonically possessed.
[02:07:07.318 --> 02:07:09.423]  And this is because, you know, this is...
[02:07:11.045 --> 02:07:16.588]  As Luciferian, as it is Bolshevik, as it is Marxist, as it is Democrat.
[02:07:17.008 --> 02:07:22.810]  And they mean to implode the country, but I have a lot of hope that we're going to stop them.
[02:07:22.890 --> 02:07:28.033]  Our joy, our laughter, our reason, our patience will win out the day.
[02:07:28.073 --> 02:07:31.854]  You know, the gifts of the Spirit will beat anything, you know, on this difficult planet.
[02:07:31.874 --> 02:07:32.115]  That's right.
[02:07:32.135 --> 02:07:34.516]  That's why they don't want us to talk about it, because they know it's the answer.
[02:07:34.916 --> 02:07:36.777]  Ali, Alexander, everybody can find you.
[02:07:37.137 --> 02:07:39.538]  Where's the best place where you're not banned?
[02:07:41.059 --> 02:07:48.542]  Telegram, I'm Ali Alexander, and I am on Truth Social at Ali, you know, like my old Twitter handle.
[02:07:48.863 --> 02:07:49.663]  And, you know, who knows?
[02:07:49.683 --> 02:07:52.864]  With Elon Musk, the deal going through, you know, who knows?
[02:07:52.924 --> 02:07:55.666]  It could be on as early as October, as late as January.
[02:07:55.686 --> 02:07:56.486]  That's good.
[02:07:56.506 --> 02:08:00.608]  You're ready to come on Sunday and do a big January 6th thing, talk about the grand jury, everything.
[02:08:01.670 --> 02:08:02.612]  Yeah, let's break some news.
[02:08:02.652 --> 02:08:07.140]  I'm not talking to any other media about it, so let's tell people how it's being set up for 2024.
[02:08:07.360 --> 02:08:10.025]  Yeah, you told me some pretty amazing stuff.
[02:08:10.206 --> 02:08:11.769]  All right, Ali Alexander, thank you so much.
[02:08:11.789 --> 02:08:12.530]  We'll talk to you Sunday.
[02:08:12.570 --> 02:08:12.891]  Be safe.
[02:08:14.087 --> 02:08:14.547]  God bless you.
[02:08:14.867 --> 02:08:15.268]  God bless you.
[02:08:15.328 --> 02:08:16.488]  Okay, we're gonna go to break.
[02:08:17.189 --> 02:08:20.290]  And I'm gonna hit this Veritas thing, which I couldn't get a lead with this today.
[02:08:21.070 --> 02:08:22.671]  Catching the lead preparing false flags.
[02:08:22.711 --> 02:08:23.572]  That's really what this is.
[02:08:24.172 --> 02:08:27.113]  And then we're gonna have the great Gerald Cilente taking over.
[02:08:27.554 --> 02:08:29.515]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[02:08:29.895 --> 02:08:32.816]  Infowarsstore.com has great products and we need your support to stay on air.
[02:08:33.176 --> 02:08:34.217]  Thank you for keeping us on air.
[02:08:34.537 --> 02:08:36.618]  You can see it's bearing fruit, so thank you for all you've done.
[02:08:36.838 --> 02:08:38.119]  We'll be right back with our number four.
[02:08:38.619 --> 02:08:39.600]  This just out from the G7.
[02:08:42.618 --> 02:08:46.642]  NATO, the New World Order force, is boosting its forces from 40,000 to 300,000.
[02:08:46.722 --> 02:08:52.088]  I'm going to have to go to Yuvaldi.
[02:08:52.128 --> 02:08:53.609]  I said I'm going to do it, and I'm going to do it.
[02:08:53.869 --> 02:08:58.334]  Yuvaldi's mom, who jumped the fence to save her son, says she's being harassed by cops at her home.
[02:08:59.035 --> 02:08:59.976]  They're really covering up.
[02:08:59.996 --> 02:09:01.557]  The head of the state police says it's a cover-up.
[02:09:02.398 --> 02:09:03.839]  We have to investigate what this is.
[02:09:04.881 --> 02:09:08.443]  And the left will send somebody to harass somebody and say that we sent them, then sue us probably.
[02:09:08.463 --> 02:09:09.003]  But so what?
[02:09:09.263 --> 02:09:11.745]  We gotta go investigate peacefully, lawfully, legally.
[02:09:11.785 --> 02:09:14.686]  It's our right to do it, no matter what dirtbag leftists say.
[02:09:16.087 --> 02:09:17.228]  This is really, really getting bad.
[02:09:17.268 --> 02:09:18.869]  I'm gonna cover that definitely on the show tomorrow.
[02:09:19.841 --> 02:09:21.241]  Gerald Cilente is about to come up.
[02:09:21.301 --> 02:09:24.242]  The big report is up on Infowars.com and ProjectVeritas.com.
[02:09:24.862 --> 02:09:35.604]  Project Veritas leak call with prison inmate reveals Democrat Senate candidate calling for secret sleepers to infiltrate South Carolina Republican Party so they can do things to make them look bad and using drug money to do it.
[02:09:36.044 --> 02:09:39.744]  Here's a part of that report from Project Veritas.
[02:09:39.764 --> 02:09:43.045]  Full report at Project Veritas website and Infowars.com.
[02:09:43.125 --> 02:09:46.626]  And then the great Gerald Cilente takes over on the other side of the break.
[02:09:46.766 --> 02:09:47.806]  Infowars.com.
[02:09:47.865 --> 02:09:49.145]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:09:49.145 --> 02:09:59.145]  [MUSIC]
[02:10:00.145 --> 02:10:04.425]   I know y'all are both activists and I am too in my own way, right?
[02:10:04.459 --> 02:10:11.222]  I'm very much as **** in a lot of ways, but I know how to turn it off and turn it on.
[02:10:11.242 --> 02:10:14.323]  You know, I know how to be in certain spaces.
[02:10:14.583 --> 02:10:17.344]  You know, you gotta be able to turn it off and turn it on.
[02:10:17.464 --> 02:10:26.308]  So, like, we literally, y'all, like, this is the only way you're gonna change the dynamics in South Carolina.
[02:10:27.308 --> 02:10:31.209]   You gotta find some folks that Are a little bit polished.
[02:10:32.510 --> 02:10:36.231]  Maybe are not, you know, nobody really knows them that well.
[02:10:36.491 --> 02:10:38.751]  Maybe they haven't really been politically active.
[02:10:39.811 --> 02:10:41.452]  But we need some secret sleepers.
[02:10:41.752 --> 02:10:46.233]  Like, we need them to run as the other side, even though they for our side.
[02:10:47.373 --> 02:10:48.934]  And we need them to win.
[02:10:50.354 --> 02:10:55.235]  Because that's how, like, I mean, we can battle them in public all day.
[02:10:55.395 --> 02:10:57.396]  As long as we know we're working for the same goal.
[02:10:58.297 --> 02:11:02.479]  You know, I tell my colleagues up here all the time, I'm going to be that bitch every day of the week.
[02:11:02.819 --> 02:11:07.661]  There's too many people that ain't us, ain't out for us, and look like that.
[02:11:07.681 --> 02:11:11.863]  I mean, but, honestly, these ain't the same type of black people that I grew up around.
[02:11:12.383 --> 02:11:16.245]  I don't recognize these black men.
[02:11:18.126 --> 02:11:20.187]  So, I don't understand the type of black that they are.
[02:11:20.207 --> 02:11:21.748]  Now, can I talk intelligently?
[02:11:22.488 --> 02:11:24.829]  I can move in all kinds of circles.
[02:11:25.686 --> 02:11:28.287]  But I'm a nigga. I love black people.
[02:11:28.347 --> 02:11:29.708]  I feel safest around my people.
[02:11:30.088 --> 02:11:34.990]  So, for me, I feel like, y'all, we need sleepers.
[02:11:35.251 --> 02:11:36.591]  But we need a group of sleepers.
[02:11:37.191 --> 02:11:44.555]  We need some folks that can wear all black at night and take their shit yard signs down when they're sleeping.
[02:11:45.242 --> 02:11:47.964]  The same shit they do to us, just the other way.
[02:11:48.064 --> 02:11:48.924]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:11:49.164 --> 02:11:51.646]  We ain't gotta make no questions about it.
[02:11:52.106 --> 02:11:54.607]  We ain't gotta go live or bondage.
[02:11:55.308 --> 02:11:57.249]  She thinks that she's invented all of this.
[02:11:57.349 --> 02:11:58.469]  It's called Dan Crenshaw.
[02:12:00.851 --> 02:12:02.532]  You didn't invent Sleeper Cell, sweetheart.
[02:12:02.572 --> 02:12:04.052]  It's called Kevin McCarthy.
[02:12:05.133 --> 02:12:06.274]  It's called Mitt Romney.
[02:12:08.055 --> 02:12:09.315]  It's called George W. Bush.
[02:12:10.816 --> 02:12:13.938]  We need Democrat globalists to pose as Republicans and run.
[02:12:15.592 --> 02:12:17.393]  That's exactly what's been going on forever.
[02:12:17.513 --> 02:12:21.554]  And then they want to use drug money, they go on to say, to control this.
[02:12:21.874 --> 02:12:26.215]  And look, I don't know, you know, I don't know if Crenshaw's stupid or he's a sellout.
[02:12:26.315 --> 02:12:27.116]  I don't want to attack the guy.
[02:12:27.136 --> 02:12:28.136]  I've invited him on the show.
[02:12:29.936 --> 02:12:40.200]  You know, he reached out to a well-known talk show host whenever I talked about him being a Davos alumni, and he's on there.
[02:12:41.040 --> 02:12:41.800]  He said it isn't true.
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:42.780]  I said, come on the show.
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:47.122]   I'd love to have Crenshaw on, but the point is, You have to go up their voting records.
[02:12:47.623 --> 02:12:50.524]  That means you actually have to go look up their voting record for yourself.
[02:12:50.644 --> 02:12:50.904]  Okay.
[02:12:50.924 --> 02:12:54.205]  I want to say wonderful job to the crew.
[02:12:54.225 --> 02:13:03.748]  I want to thank you all for tuning in today, and I want to invite you to have a fiery 55 minutes with the great trends forecaster, Gerald Cilente, in T-minus 60 seconds.
[02:13:05.033 --> 02:13:08.553]   When we go to break, I separately want to encourage you all to have it on your shelf

[02:13:27.592 --> 02:13:29.673]  Gerald Cilente coming up in 60 seconds.
[02:13:30.472 --> 02:13:37.273]   Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show. And yeah, the election was stolen.
[02:13:37.546 --> 02:13:39.246]  Our freedom has been stolen.
[02:13:39.266 --> 02:13:48.708]  And this country has gone down physically, emotionally and spiritually in ways that, you know, just beyond the belief.
[02:13:50.409 --> 02:13:53.889]  And of course, now the big issue is Roe vs. Wade.
[02:13:54.570 --> 02:13:56.130]  And I'm not going to take a side on it.
[02:13:56.150 --> 02:13:59.571]  I'm just going to look at it for what it is and what's going on.
[02:14:01.351 --> 02:14:08.778]   Number one, they're going to say that the Democrats are going to use this And it's going to help them win the midterm elections.
[02:14:09.338 --> 02:14:12.100]  And I want to make this 100% clear.
[02:14:13.481 --> 02:14:17.563]  I don't want the Democrats to win the midterm election.
[02:14:17.983 --> 02:14:21.566]  And I want to make it 100% clear.
[02:14:22.266 --> 02:14:28.169]  I don't want the Repulsivekins winning the midterm election.
[02:14:28.630 --> 02:14:31.511]  They're both, to me, a crime syndicate.
[02:14:32.132 --> 02:14:35.454]  By their deeds, you shall know them.
[02:14:37.190 --> 02:14:43.054]  How many more wars these low-life pieces of scum have to start?
[02:14:43.654 --> 02:14:49.478]  How much more of our money do they have to steal to give to the too-big-to-fails?
[02:14:50.119 --> 02:14:55.722]  Yeah, how could you be so stupid to look up to a clown like McConnell?
[02:14:56.023 --> 02:14:59.505]  Well, maybe you ought to bend over for Lindsey Graham.
[02:14:59.545 --> 02:15:01.186]  Yeah, he'd like that.
[02:15:02.027 --> 02:15:05.249]  That little clown, there's not a war that he hasn't pushed for.
[02:15:08.761 --> 02:15:13.122]  One after another, little boys that couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag.
[02:15:13.142 --> 02:15:16.823]  And how much more of our money do they have to steal?
[02:15:16.843 --> 02:15:25.145]  In the name of too big to fill, hey, hey, Salenti, I'm Jamie Dimon.
[02:15:25.565 --> 02:15:27.366]  Don't you know who I am?
[02:15:28.346 --> 02:15:43.602]   Yeah, my bank and all the others were going out of toilet, but they pumped 29 trillion into the system between 2007 to 2010 to give me more dough.
[02:15:43.962 --> 02:15:49.785]  My bank has only been convicted of five felonies, but you're just a piece of crap.
[02:15:50.145 --> 02:15:59.669]  We'll lock you up for anything, but hey, I'll stay on top because the repulsive gins and demo craps, I bought them all out.
[02:16:00.550 --> 02:16:05.112]  Oh, just like that clown show going on over there in Illinois?
[02:16:06.568 --> 02:16:14.590]  Oh yeah, you got a senator's or governor's race and a guy Pritzker that could throw an S in there too for it.
[02:16:15.050 --> 02:16:19.251]  Oh my daddy, my family, we own Hyatt.
[02:16:19.572 --> 02:16:21.912]  Hyatt Hotel, we got a lot of dough.
[02:16:22.672 --> 02:16:25.053]  And that other guy Griffin dumping in billions.
[02:16:27.134 --> 02:16:28.774]  The whole game is rigged.
[02:16:30.535 --> 02:16:38.296]   So going back to Roe vs. Wade and what's going on, and the hypocrisy of the government.
[02:16:38.296 --> 02:16:45.616]  Where these people.
[02:16:45.616 --> 02:16:55.616]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:16:46.703 --> 02:16:51.245]  These are the biggest libtards out there protesting.
[02:16:52.146 --> 02:16:54.127]  My body, my choice.
[02:16:55.988 --> 02:16:56.949]  Okay, fine.
[02:16:58.329 --> 02:17:01.231]  A, fat mouth.
[02:17:02.426 --> 02:17:04.708]  How about your being sexist?
[02:17:05.088 --> 02:17:06.430]  It's only about women?
[02:17:07.491 --> 02:17:09.492]  How about my body, my choice?
[02:17:11.975 --> 02:17:23.145]  I don't want to get a gene therapy operation warp speed injection, the first ever injected into the human body, into my body.
[02:17:23.945 --> 02:17:25.687]  How about my body, my choice?
[02:17:28.772 --> 02:17:30.132]  Hey, fat mouths!
[02:17:30.653 --> 02:17:35.154]  Hey, all of you ones that My Body, My Choice, you are sexist!
[02:17:35.674 --> 02:17:38.415]  My Body, My Choice, I'm a man!
[02:17:39.955 --> 02:17:45.616]  I don't want a drug dealer's injection going into my body!
[02:17:45.997 --> 02:17:47.637]  Where are all of you people?
[02:17:47.957 --> 02:17:51.178]  You're the ones that were selling the injection!
[02:17:51.898 --> 02:17:52.758]  Oh, that's right!
[02:17:53.679 --> 02:17:55.119]  Planned Parenthood!
[02:17:57.380 --> 02:17:58.000]  Google it up.
[02:17:58.421 --> 02:17:59.021]  Google it up.
[02:17:59.961 --> 02:18:12.207]  The lowest number I could find that they pushed into the system to sell the Vax $2 million.
[02:18:12.547 --> 02:18:14.348]  Hey, Planned Parenthood.
[02:18:14.728 --> 02:18:16.549]  What about my body, my choice?
[02:18:17.369 --> 02:18:18.589]  Hey, you hypocrites.
[02:18:19.130 --> 02:18:20.810]  My body, my choice.
[02:18:21.171 --> 02:18:24.212]  Don't you tell me what to inject into my body.
[02:18:25.372 --> 02:18:26.293]  Oh, no, Solente.
[02:18:27.250 --> 02:18:29.151]  It's only women that count!
[02:18:30.312 --> 02:18:31.152]  You don't count!
[02:18:31.712 --> 02:18:34.113]  You're just a little guinea from the Bronx!
[02:18:35.274 --> 02:18:36.554]  You're a nobody!
[02:18:41.197 --> 02:18:42.958]  My body, my choice, huh?
[02:18:43.598 --> 02:18:45.299]  There's a lot of body there, Marron.
[02:18:46.139 --> 02:18:49.100]  Anyway, let's see.
[02:18:49.361 --> 02:18:54.863]  George Soros, who according to Bloomberg Business is worth $8.5 billion, said, quote, the U.S.
[02:18:54.903 --> 02:19:01.961]   Supreme Court's decision to oververt Roe v. Wade ends federal protections for abortion, diminishes human rights.
[02:19:01.981 --> 02:19:06.223]  Hey, Soros, how about my human rights?
[02:19:07.123 --> 02:19:08.624]  How about my human rights?
[02:19:09.444 --> 02:19:11.165]  Oh, you're not a human, Solente.
[02:19:11.565 --> 02:19:12.645]  Don't you know who I am?
[02:19:12.665 --> 02:19:14.566]  Man, I'll tell you what.
[02:19:15.207 --> 02:19:20.909]  If I looked like you, you could keep your billions of bucks, man.
[02:19:22.279 --> 02:19:27.440]  One wouldn't want to go to a trip with a face like that and an attitude like yours.
[02:19:28.180 --> 02:19:29.181]  What hypocrisy.
[02:19:30.241 --> 02:19:31.181]  What hypocrisy.
[02:19:33.341 --> 02:19:33.541]  Yep.
[02:19:35.542 --> 02:19:45.304]  And other billionaires have joined Soros, who is secretly more wealthy, tied up to ba-ba-ba-ba as Open Society Foundations.
[02:19:45.684 --> 02:19:50.065]  That's a great NGO overthrowing governments, allegedly.
[02:19:51.173 --> 02:20:10.366]  Jeff Bezos ex-wife Mackenzie Scott has been another proponent of reproductive rights and donated a record $275 million to Planned Parenthood last year.
[02:20:10.866 --> 02:20:18.491]  Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation plan to invest $1 billion in family planning by 2030.
[02:20:22.409 --> 02:20:24.871]  How much have you invested for peace?
[02:20:26.332 --> 02:20:28.554]  How much have you invested for peace?
[02:20:28.894 --> 02:20:41.925]  Hey, Mackenzie Scott, we're having a peace and freedom rally here in Kingston, New York, on July 23rd.
[02:20:44.787 --> 02:20:51.032]  Starting at two o'clock, Judge Napolitano, Scott Ritter, Gary Noe, myself, others will be here, hot damn bear.
[02:20:52.014 --> 02:20:52.554]  Vendors?
[02:20:53.355 --> 02:20:57.317]  How about donating not $275 million.
[02:20:59.638 --> 02:21:03.560]  How about just donating $50 million?
[02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:07.482]  How about you all you fat mouths over there?
[02:21:07.502 --> 02:21:15.485]  You're worrying about rights of babies that have been unborn.
[02:21:15.505 --> 02:21:20.548]  How about the rights of individuals that are living?
[02:21:22.512 --> 02:21:26.034]  That don't want to die in war and are tired of it.
[02:21:27.675 --> 02:21:30.337]  And don't want to be told what to do with our bodies.
[02:21:30.877 --> 02:21:34.619]  You're all a bunch of low-life hypocrites.
[02:21:35.860 --> 02:21:36.300]  Arrogant!
[02:21:38.321 --> 02:21:38.742]  Arrogant!
[02:21:39.142 --> 02:21:39.562]  Arrogant!
[02:21:40.863 --> 02:21:45.646]  Little boys and girls who give nothing.
[02:21:46.606 --> 02:21:47.727]  Peanuts of peace.
[02:21:50.288 --> 02:21:50.789]  Peanuts!
[02:21:52.110 --> 02:21:53.050]  Peanut brains.
[02:21:55.211 --> 02:22:01.132]  And you imagine hypocrisy of Gates, the vaccine king of the world.
[02:22:04.252 --> 02:22:08.833]  Denouncing Roe versus Wade, my body, my choice.
[02:22:11.094 --> 02:22:17.835]  As you have no choice to take a vaccine that you keep promoting all over the world.
[02:22:20.196 --> 02:22:21.756]  Get this in your head, everybody.
[02:22:24.404 --> 02:22:27.288]  Mentally ill people are controlling the world.
[02:22:28.809 --> 02:22:30.611]  This is bigger than big.
[02:22:31.272 --> 02:22:37.319]  It's demonic, satanic, evil, and cruel.
[02:22:39.381 --> 02:22:39.882]  Oh, yeah.
[02:22:41.083 --> 02:22:43.847]  Rights of a newborn, but no rights to me.
[02:22:45.532 --> 02:22:47.693]  You're just a little Italian from the Bronx.
[02:22:47.733 --> 02:22:48.893]  You grew up in the Bronx.
[02:22:49.353 --> 02:22:50.254]  You're a nobody.
[02:22:50.314 --> 02:22:50.774]  Hey!
[02:22:50.794 --> 02:22:52.574]  Don't you know who my daddy was?
[02:22:53.095 --> 02:22:54.295]  My daddy was George Bush.
[02:22:54.375 --> 02:22:54.675]  No, no.
[02:22:54.715 --> 02:22:56.196]  My daddy was Trudeau.
[02:22:56.536 --> 02:22:56.816]  Yeah.
[02:22:58.196 --> 02:22:59.797]  It's one big show and you ain't in it.
[02:23:00.537 --> 02:23:02.418]  So stay in it and support InfoWars.
[02:23:03.358 --> 02:23:05.399]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:05.419 --> 02:23:06.839]  Listen to what Alex just said.
[02:23:07.840 --> 02:23:08.960]  Inflation is going to go.
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:10.421]  It's much going to get much worse.
[02:23:11.521 --> 02:23:13.061]  And so get these products now.
[02:23:13.101 --> 02:23:13.442]  He's 100% correct.
[02:23:15.350 --> 02:23:19.813]  We are in a period of life unimaginable.
[02:23:19.893 --> 02:23:24.275]  I've been in the trend forecasting business 42 years.
[02:23:25.436 --> 02:23:25.776]  42 years.
[02:23:26.777 --> 02:23:27.597]  That's when I began it.
[02:23:28.237 --> 02:23:29.878]  I've never seen anything like this.
[02:23:31.539 --> 02:23:39.504]  The whole situation that's been created is done by mentally ill people.
[02:23:39.924 --> 02:23:43.386]  They're called politicians, polytics, many tics.
[02:23:44.087 --> 02:23:47.990]  That sucked the life out of your body so they could get everything that they want.
[02:23:49.732 --> 02:24:01.121]  The inflation that they caused is very clear in front of everybody's eyes since the panic of 08, when they started pumping all this cheap money into the system and artificially hyping it up.
[02:24:02.482 --> 02:24:08.927]  And as John Williams' shadow stats shows, the inflation numbers are double or more than what they actually are.
[02:24:09.708 --> 02:24:13.711]  The housing prices only went up like, what, 20% a year for the last couple of years.
[02:24:14.531 --> 02:24:16.092]  You know, no, that's not inflation.
[02:24:16.132 --> 02:24:17.093]  We don't put that in there.
[02:24:18.213 --> 02:24:19.614]  Oh, the price of steak went up.
[02:24:19.654 --> 02:24:19.955]  No, no.
[02:24:19.995 --> 02:24:22.556]  People are eating chopped meat now, so we're not going to put that in there.
[02:24:23.297 --> 02:24:24.497]  This is actually what they've done.
[02:24:26.299 --> 02:24:27.239]  And worse than that.
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:30.361]  So listen to what Alex said.
[02:24:31.222 --> 02:24:32.603]  Get these products now.
[02:24:33.343 --> 02:24:36.265]  You're getting them for three major reasons.
[02:24:36.665 --> 02:24:38.967]  Reason number one is yourself.
[02:24:41.088 --> 02:24:55.160]   Reason number two, To keep the truth alive and stay on by keeping InfoWars out there because the guests today bring on the hard work that the people do there and how Alex puts his neck on the line.
[02:24:55.800 --> 02:24:56.400]  Like, woof!
[02:24:57.301 --> 02:25:01.603]  You want to do everything you can to support the truth because they're robbing it from us day by day.
[02:25:01.623 --> 02:25:05.264]  And number three goes back to inflation.
[02:25:05.385 --> 02:25:08.206]  You'll save a lot of dough by doing it now.
[02:25:08.786 --> 02:25:12.508]  So anyway, go to InfoWarsStores.com and get what you can get.
[02:25:13.396 --> 02:25:18.542]  I was talking about the hypocrisy of these anti-abortion people.
[02:25:19.403 --> 02:25:30.556]  These are the biggest proponents of forcing us like that slimeball Gates, the Vax King of the world.
[02:25:31.932 --> 02:25:33.932]  What a hypocrite little boy!
[02:25:34.453 --> 02:25:45.915]  And again, when you look at the Gates, and you look at the Zuckerbergs, and you look at the Cooks and the Peacheyes, these are the geek freaks that have taken over the human spirit.
[02:25:46.535 --> 02:25:47.055]  That's right.
[02:25:48.675 --> 02:25:49.556]  One after another.
[02:25:50.476 --> 02:25:51.916]  Little boys of nothing.
[02:25:53.836 --> 02:25:55.457]  Little cowardly boys.
[02:25:57.317 --> 02:25:58.217]  The geek world.
[02:25:58.977 --> 02:26:01.378]  They took the spirit out of life.
[02:26:02.219 --> 02:26:03.320]  They did it with music.
[02:26:04.621 --> 02:26:06.002]  Oh, no, we could digitize it.
[02:26:06.042 --> 02:26:07.042]  It's just as good.
[02:26:07.703 --> 02:26:07.983]  Yeah.
[02:26:08.603 --> 02:26:10.144]  Count Basie, Duke Ellington.
[02:26:10.525 --> 02:26:11.465]  No, forget them.
[02:26:14.167 --> 02:26:15.108]  That's Domino.
[02:26:15.308 --> 02:26:16.268]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:26:16.308 --> 02:26:16.809]  Forget that.
[02:26:18.870 --> 02:26:19.310]  No, no, no.
[02:26:19.330 --> 02:26:19.611]  Forget it.
[02:26:19.631 --> 02:26:20.131]  Forget all this.
[02:26:21.292 --> 02:26:22.292]  We got digital now.
[02:26:23.473 --> 02:26:24.434]  And one bad rap.
[02:26:25.354 --> 02:26:29.297]  This country's gone down physically, emotionally and spiritually, like I said.
[02:26:30.134 --> 02:26:32.795]  And the geeks brought it down the hardest and the fastest to me.
[02:26:33.095 --> 02:26:35.056]  Along with the banksters, but they've always been doing that.
[02:26:35.936 --> 02:26:41.479]  All you have to do is remember what happened to Jesus Christ three days after he drove him out of the temple.
[02:26:41.699 --> 02:26:42.859]  It's on the cross.
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:44.420]  Nailed to it.
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:47.501]  Going back to the hypocrisy.
[02:26:48.761 --> 02:26:59.706]  So they had yesterday, Reuters headline today, Pride parades march on with new urgency across US.
[02:27:01.559 --> 02:27:03.160]  Number one, be who you want to be.
[02:27:03.180 --> 02:27:03.980]  I don't care.
[02:27:04.800 --> 02:27:05.500]  It's your trip.
[02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:07.821]  You know, if you're proud of it, that's okay.
[02:27:08.161 --> 02:27:09.661]  I'm proud of who I am.
[02:27:09.942 --> 02:27:10.762]  I don't talk about it.
[02:27:11.062 --> 02:27:12.222]  Be wherever you want to be.
[02:27:12.262 --> 02:27:13.323]  Do whatever you want to do.
[02:27:13.703 --> 02:27:14.583]  This is America.
[02:27:15.243 --> 02:27:19.724]  But pride parades march on with new urgency across U.S.
[02:27:22.725 --> 02:27:28.267]  It's too bad there is no peace in their pride march.
[02:27:32.259 --> 02:27:43.805]  As the United States sends tens of billions of dollars of weaponry to keep bloodying the killing fields of Ukraine.
[02:27:44.886 --> 02:27:46.226]  Have no pride in that.
[02:27:47.067 --> 02:27:48.347]  No pride in peace.
[02:27:49.008 --> 02:27:49.248]  Nope.
[02:27:49.768 --> 02:28:14.641]   Hey, if, if, if, if the pride folks And the pro-abortion, my body, my choice folks, united for peace, then it would be news!
[02:28:15.467 --> 02:28:17.609]  There, there, now we're talking!
[02:28:18.089 --> 02:28:19.110]  Big news!
[02:28:21.492 --> 02:28:22.213]  Now hear this!
[02:28:22.753 --> 02:28:25.136]  I'm a little Jake Tapper up here, you know what?
[02:28:25.516 --> 02:28:28.679]  I'm a little, uh, uh, what's that called?
[02:28:28.859 --> 02:28:30.320]  Anderson Cooper.
[02:28:30.741 --> 02:28:32.402]  Daddy's girl, no, Mommy's girl.
[02:28:32.442 --> 02:28:33.503]  Mommy's boy, I forgot.
[02:28:33.963 --> 02:28:35.545]  Gloria Vanderbilt's son, yeah.
[02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:46.487]  Oh, you would all be promoting if it was a Pride Peace March and a Planned Parenthood Peace March.
[02:28:47.648 --> 02:28:48.708]  Oh, then it would be news.
[02:28:49.009 --> 02:28:58.295]  But hey, Celenti's having a rally with Judge Napolitano, Scott Ritter, Gary Null, and others, Hot Damn Ben.
[02:28:58.876 --> 02:29:00.877]  Then having a free party.
[02:29:00.937 --> 02:29:02.978]  Come, you know, you buy what you want from the vendors.
[02:29:05.260 --> 02:29:06.361]  For peace and freedom.
[02:29:08.939 --> 02:29:10.520]  The true American spirit.
[02:29:11.720 --> 02:29:13.201]  No foreign entanglements.
[02:29:13.661 --> 02:29:14.701]  Oh, George Washington.
[02:29:14.721 --> 02:29:16.222]  Oh, you're gonna listen to George Washington?
[02:29:16.462 --> 02:29:17.382]  He was a slave!
[02:29:17.882 --> 02:29:18.802]  And yeah, take it easy.
[02:29:18.822 --> 02:29:20.723]  Across the Delaware, right?
[02:29:20.763 --> 02:29:23.164]  Went and fight, not like these little boys like Obama.
[02:29:23.604 --> 02:29:25.525]  I want that guy Assad out of there.
[02:29:25.905 --> 02:29:28.566]  I want that guy Qaddafi out of there.
[02:29:28.606 --> 02:29:29.926]  No, I'm not gonna go take him out.
[02:29:29.946 --> 02:29:30.767]  You go take him out.
[02:29:31.427 --> 02:29:37.289]  Yeah, I can't fight my way out of a paper bag, but boy do I know how to talk arrogantly and have stupid people follow what I tell them.
[02:29:40.285 --> 02:29:41.766]  Yeah, those people.
[02:29:41.786 --> 02:29:59.281]  They'd all be bragging, all be bragging if it was a pride peace parade or a Planned Parenthood peace parade.
[02:30:01.943 --> 02:30:15.715]   But a true American spirit, Rally for Occupy Peace and the United, or the Universal Church of Freedom, Peace and Justice?
[02:30:16.196 --> 02:30:17.756]  Nah, that's not news!
[02:30:18.737 --> 02:30:20.037]  We don't want peace!
[02:30:20.637 --> 02:30:22.018]  We're prostitutes!
[02:30:22.518 --> 02:30:23.938]  We sell war!
[02:30:24.559 --> 02:30:26.039]  We sell war!
[02:30:29.360 --> 02:30:31.561]  Hypocrisy, right in front of our eyes.
[02:30:32.061 --> 02:30:41.501]   So going back to where I was going to begin at, What you're looking at, is this going to be an issue when I started in the midterm elections?
[02:30:41.841 --> 02:30:42.021]  No.
[02:30:42.661 --> 02:30:42.821]  No.
[02:30:43.481 --> 02:30:45.342]  It may be, but a small one.
[02:30:46.322 --> 02:30:47.922]  It's the economy, stupid.
[02:30:48.782 --> 02:30:51.623]  That was the phrase that the Clinton administration used in 1992.
[02:30:52.463 --> 02:30:55.884]  That's all the people really care about are their pocketbooks.
[02:30:56.904 --> 02:30:58.304]  That's going to decide this.
[02:30:58.524 --> 02:31:04.205]  Yeah, there may be something that comes up and they throw a false flag that changes the deal and puts it back onto this.
[02:31:05.737 --> 02:31:07.117]  It's the economy, stupid.
[02:31:08.177 --> 02:31:11.618]  And remember, inflation is a part of that, stupid.
[02:31:12.738 --> 02:31:19.459]  So do what you can now to buy these products from InfoWarsStores.com, because inflation is going to get much worse.
[02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:24.980]  And you're going to do everything you need to protect yourself in these rough times ahead.
[02:31:26.200 --> 02:31:26.821]  We'll be right back.
[02:31:27.361 --> 02:31:30.021]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show and InfoWars.
[02:31:30.061 --> 02:31:33.102]  And again, do everything you can to support InfoWars.
[02:31:33.362 --> 02:31:34.422]  The future's in your hands.
[02:31:34.482 --> 02:31:35.102]  Don't drop it.
[02:31:36.027 --> 02:31:38.609]  Because they're censoring us all over the place.
[02:31:38.689 --> 02:31:46.896]  Again, going back to the hypocrisy of Planned Parenthood, the vaccine champions, the my body, my choice hypocrites.
[02:31:47.676 --> 02:31:57.064]  You know, if you say anything that, you know, you didn't want to get the vax or you didn't believe in it because of different reasons, you were censored and still are.
[02:31:59.366 --> 02:32:03.669]  And so that this has happened in this country is heartbreaking to me.
[02:32:04.633 --> 02:32:08.697]  And that's why I'm doing everything to support Infowars, and you can too.
[02:32:09.357 --> 02:32:14.422]  And again, if you want to see history before it happens, everything's going on in the economy now.
[02:32:15.042 --> 02:32:31.197]  You know, we had forecast this inflation almost two years ago, and giving the data why it was happening, while the Federal Reserve, the Fed head Powell, and Janet Yellen, screaming that it was only temporary and transitory, or transgender-tory, to be proper.
[02:32:32.439 --> 02:32:33.660]  You know, it's just a bunch of BS.
[02:32:33.700 --> 02:32:38.321]  So TrendsJournal.com, the magazine, averages about 160 pages a week.
[02:32:38.341 --> 02:32:39.762]  You read what you want, no ads.
[02:32:40.282 --> 02:32:44.463]  There's a real magazine telling you what in the world is going on, what it means, what's next, what to do.
[02:32:45.244 --> 02:32:47.104]  And the motto, of course, being think for yourself.
[02:32:48.385 --> 02:32:58.048]  And there's the brilliant covers by Anthony Frieda, the current one, you know, picture of the White House with a fence around it saying mental institution.
[02:32:58.627 --> 02:32:59.968]  I mean, how much more proof do you need?
[02:33:00.128 --> 02:33:04.091]  How stupid can you be to believe this garbage that the mainstream floods out?
[02:33:04.111 --> 02:33:10.655]  And speaking of which, the big promoters of war, if there hasn't been a war they never loved, remember the Maine?
[02:33:10.855 --> 02:33:12.276]  Oh, that was the Hearst Foundation.
[02:33:12.617 --> 02:33:17.540]  How about the Gulf of Tonkin incident that never happened that they sold us?
[02:33:17.580 --> 02:33:19.221]  That McNamara lied us into that.
[02:33:19.642 --> 02:33:20.222]  Oh, that's okay.
[02:33:20.242 --> 02:33:20.922]  The media did it.
[02:33:21.583 --> 02:33:24.665]  How about Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al-Qaeda?
[02:33:24.705 --> 02:33:26.066]  It doesn't matter if it's true or false.
[02:33:26.527 --> 02:33:34.912]  Remember the New York Times helped sell it with the lie that he got these aluminum tubes from Nigeria, Niger someplace to make the weapons.
[02:33:36.373 --> 02:33:44.698]  So we're giving you what no one else has really given you in that terms of a magazine and with trends, which is the only real trends magazine in the world.
[02:33:44.718 --> 02:33:46.439]  It's a trendsjournal.com.
[02:33:47.039 --> 02:33:56.265]  So going back to the, to prostitutes and the mainstream media, Boris Johnson warns Russian victory in Ukraine would be absolutely catastrophic.
[02:33:58.288 --> 02:34:01.491]  Boris Johnson warns?
[02:34:02.732 --> 02:34:04.293]  How about Mickey Mouse warns?
[02:34:05.814 --> 02:34:07.296]  How about Goofy warns?
[02:34:08.737 --> 02:34:19.086]  How about you couldn't create a more arrogant, narcissistic, lying piece of scum crap like Boris Johnson?
[02:34:20.433 --> 02:34:26.155]  The Boris Johnson that locked down the UK, can't go out, can't go out and play, but I can.
[02:34:26.535 --> 02:34:29.416]  Lied about it, keeps got away with it over and over again.
[02:34:29.436 --> 02:34:35.038]  A little Boris, another daddy's boy by the way, another little nothing of a clown boy.
[02:34:35.818 --> 02:34:40.360]  Nothing of a clown boy that couldn't fight their way again out of a paper bag.
[02:34:43.921 --> 02:34:45.862]  BSing with Tapa Crappa.
[02:34:48.603 --> 02:34:49.203]  On Sunday.
[02:34:51.636 --> 02:35:00.641]  Allowing Russian President Putin to succeed in his invasion of Ukraine would have absolutely catastrophic consequences for the world.
[02:35:01.762 --> 02:35:02.562]  A fat face.
[02:35:03.042 --> 02:35:03.262]  How?
[02:35:03.983 --> 02:35:04.383]  Tell me how.
[02:35:05.584 --> 02:35:10.106]  Tell me how it would have absolutely catastrophic consequences for the world.
[02:35:11.347 --> 02:35:14.649]  What's going on between Ukraine and Russia like they're right next to each other, right?
[02:35:14.669 --> 02:35:17.410]  They might be part of each other on and off for centuries.
[02:35:18.971 --> 02:35:26.077]   What does it have to do with the You know, if it goes back to Russia, Russia's in control of it.
[02:35:27.337 --> 02:35:29.378]  How will that be catastrophic for the rest of the world?
[02:35:29.878 --> 02:35:37.219]  Oh, I know, it's coming out of the fat mouth of one of the murderous groups of low-life people in the world.
[02:35:38.479 --> 02:35:40.040]  The British are coming!
[02:35:40.620 --> 02:35:41.820]  The British are coming!
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:43.420]  No, not like that, Solenti.
[02:35:43.921 --> 02:35:45.741]  The British are coming to kill you.
[02:35:45.761 --> 02:35:47.501]  Oh, yeah.
[02:35:48.922 --> 02:35:50.662]  American Revolution, who do we fight?
[02:35:52.193 --> 02:35:52.994]  Oh, I know.
[02:35:53.294 --> 02:35:56.377]  The sun never sets on the British Empire.
[02:35:57.277 --> 02:35:57.958]  Empire?
[02:35:58.698 --> 02:36:04.203]  You mean your murderous low lives that go into countries to steal what they have?
[02:36:05.604 --> 02:36:07.766]  And you've been doing it for centuries?
[02:36:09.367 --> 02:36:13.491]  Look at how you screwed up the world after World War I that you instigated.
[02:36:15.312 --> 02:36:21.816]   Oh yeah, cutting up You know, the Balfour Agreement, all other things taking over control of countries?
[02:36:23.999 --> 02:36:24.679]  The British!
[02:36:25.400 --> 02:36:26.041]  Or the Queen!
[02:36:26.281 --> 02:36:27.462]  The nobility!
[02:36:27.862 --> 02:36:30.765]  The nobility that don't do number one and number two?
[02:36:31.486 --> 02:36:32.047]  No, no.
[02:36:34.949 --> 02:36:35.690]  The English.
[02:36:36.391 --> 02:36:38.413]  The sun never sets on the British.
[02:36:38.553 --> 02:36:38.813]  Oh, yeah.
[02:36:39.094 --> 02:36:40.595]  Into the Valley of Death, Road to 600.
[02:36:41.713 --> 02:36:45.194]  What are you doing over there trying to conquer Afghanistan?
[02:36:45.575 --> 02:36:46.195]  Wait a minute!
[02:36:46.415 --> 02:36:51.197]  Let the Americans go following the Russians and let them get slaughtered.
[02:36:54.618 --> 02:36:55.698]  This clown goes on.
[02:36:57.799 --> 02:36:59.000]  Speaking to Jake Tapper.
[02:37:01.021 --> 02:37:03.802]  Hours after Russian missiles hit Kiev.
[02:37:05.062 --> 02:37:07.243]  Front page of the Wall Street Journal.
[02:37:09.585 --> 02:37:12.366]  Russian missile strikes target Ukraine's capital.
[02:37:14.546 --> 02:37:15.987]  Hey, who wrote this?
[02:37:16.047 --> 02:37:16.607]  Who wrote this?
[02:37:18.007 --> 02:37:18.888]  What prestitute?
[02:37:20.368 --> 02:37:30.591]  Alex or Alan Cullison and you leave a Cherenovo, you leave her at home, do whatever you want with her.
[02:37:32.631 --> 02:37:38.095]   How come you weren't writing about U.S.
[02:37:38.256 --> 02:37:47.481]  missile strikes target all of the countries where they've killed millions of people.
[02:37:48.442 --> 02:38:00.009]  I didn't see this weekly, daily, hourly coverage with the Iraq War that they lied us into, both of them.
[02:38:00.930 --> 02:38:02.511]  Oh, you remember the first Bush war?
[02:38:02.751 --> 02:38:04.252]  The first murderous Bush war?
[02:38:04.732 --> 02:38:05.132]  Oh, yeah.
[02:38:06.903 --> 02:38:12.367]  Iraqi soldiers are going into hospitals and bayoneting little kids in incubators.
[02:38:12.447 --> 02:38:13.687]  Remember that made-up story?
[02:38:15.028 --> 02:38:16.289]  Or Saddam Hussein.
[02:38:16.569 --> 02:38:25.655]  How come you weren't showing all of the deadliness that the United States and its NATO allies were committing?
[02:38:25.735 --> 02:38:28.157]  Oh, I forgot about Yugoslavia and the Kosovo War.
[02:38:30.498 --> 02:38:33.000]  This is why you listen to InfoWars.
[02:38:34.060 --> 02:38:36.342]  And this is why you subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[02:38:37.266 --> 02:38:38.867]  I'm not taking a side here.
[02:38:39.447 --> 02:38:43.088]  I'm just giving you facts as the prostitutes take sides.
[02:38:43.668 --> 02:38:52.490]  And they're prostitutes because they're media whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and their government whoremasters.
[02:38:52.970 --> 02:38:54.051]  So they're prostitutes.
[02:38:54.891 --> 02:38:56.271]  And those are proper words.
[02:38:58.812 --> 02:39:13.245]   So, I would just say to the people in the United States that this is something that America historically does and has And this is to step up for peace and freedom and democracy.
[02:39:14.625 --> 02:39:19.627]  First of all, don't you say anything to the people of the United States.
[02:39:20.307 --> 02:39:21.887]  Mind your own damn business.
[02:39:22.287 --> 02:39:23.168]  I'm an American.
[02:39:23.488 --> 02:39:28.609]  I don't need a Mickey Mouse clown like you to tell me what to think.
[02:39:29.229 --> 02:39:34.831]  And secondly, promoting the lines of peace and freedom and democracy.
[02:39:36.061 --> 02:39:37.781]  Yeah, was a racket.
[02:39:38.721 --> 02:39:40.302]  That was General Smedley Butler.
[02:39:42.082 --> 02:39:42.942]  What are you kidding me?
[02:39:43.922 --> 02:39:46.543]  Not like we brought freedom and democracy to Afghanistan.
[02:39:47.143 --> 02:39:51.584]  Cost about 2.3 trillion dollars, left several billion dollars worth of weapons there.
[02:39:53.064 --> 02:40:01.925]  These are the ignorant, arrogant, imbecilic, psychopaths, sociopaths, and pathological liars running and ruining our life in a country near you.
[02:40:02.966 --> 02:40:05.346]  If we don't unite for peace, we're going to die in war.
[02:40:06.548 --> 02:40:08.049]  All these people want his power.
[02:40:08.389 --> 02:40:15.972]  This clown boy says he's going to keep staying in there despite all the criticism about him and how his party's losing until 2030.
[02:40:16.032 --> 02:40:19.734]  They're power-hungry freaks.
[02:40:21.535 --> 02:40:22.655]  That's a good picture of him.
[02:40:24.356 --> 02:40:25.857]  He looks sober, almost.
[02:40:27.117 --> 02:40:28.478]  Slobbingly slover.
[02:40:29.398 --> 02:40:30.019]  Look at that jerk.
[02:40:30.059 --> 02:40:31.599]  Hey, is that your natural color hair?
[02:40:31.619 --> 02:40:33.160]  How many bottles of dye did you throw on it?
[02:40:34.212 --> 02:40:39.655]  Hey, listen, we're gonna be back in a little while, but remember, support InfoWars, do everything you can.
[02:40:40.196 --> 02:40:43.858]  We are in the time of our life, a crisis like I've never seen.
[02:40:44.398 --> 02:40:45.119]  We'll be right back.
[02:40:46.540 --> 02:40:48.941]  Hey, boy, that's some movie.
[02:40:48.981 --> 02:40:53.924]  That COVID-land boy really, really pushes it out and says it like it is.
[02:40:54.004 --> 02:40:55.065]  That's something.
[02:40:55.485 --> 02:41:07.630]   And, uh, again, you know how, how the hypocrisy of, uh, There's Planned Parenthood and all these people that are pushing for my body, my choice.
[02:41:08.911 --> 02:41:10.852]  And it's not our body, our choice.
[02:41:12.514 --> 02:41:18.359]  Not to get an Operation Warp Speed gene therapy inoculation jabbed into you.
[02:41:19.099 --> 02:41:20.200]  No jab, no job.
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:21.561]  Look how they destroyed this economy.
[02:41:21.582 --> 02:41:26.626]  By the way, I want to talk about the economy and what's going on and what to expect.
[02:41:27.166 --> 02:41:30.109]  But first, I want to talk about supporting InfoWars.
[02:41:30.808 --> 02:41:35.911]  And one of the ways you do it by supporting InfoWars, you're supporting yourself with these great products.
[02:41:36.592 --> 02:41:39.734]  And one of the standouts is that survival shield.

[02:42:02.888 --> 02:42:07.291]  So you want to fight back with one of nature's greatest essentials.
[02:42:07.311 --> 02:42:16.956]  You know, the World Health Organization estimates that nearly 50 million people will suffer from some kind of mental impairment related to eyes, eye and deficiency.
[02:42:17.817 --> 02:42:24.781]  And even a CDC says that eye, eye and deficiency is one of the four major deficiency diseases in the world.
[02:42:24.801 --> 02:42:27.002]  That's probably why so many people are brain dead.
[02:42:27.751 --> 02:42:32.352]  And that's why it's so important for you to try Survival Shield X2.

[02:43:30.997 --> 02:43:33.918]  Infowarsstores.com.
[02:43:35.399 --> 02:43:38.840]  So going back to the economy and the stupidity.
[02:43:40.401 --> 02:44:00.437]   I was talking before about how they artificially inflated the economy with zero and negative interest rate policy over there in the ECB and zero interest rate in the United States, even though They're lying to us that they had a 2% inflation rate, and when it went over that, they would raise rates.
[02:44:00.977 --> 02:44:06.840]  They said that, oh, it was only temporary, transitory, and again, in today's world now, transgender-tory inflation.
[02:44:08.281 --> 02:44:09.922]  And we said, no, this is going to happen.
[02:44:10.462 --> 02:44:13.303]  You better prepare, prevail, because it's going to get a lot worse.
[02:44:15.184 --> 02:44:15.965]  And now it is.
[02:44:18.086 --> 02:44:21.808]  The higher they raise interest rates, the deeper this thing is going to collapse.
[02:44:23.004 --> 02:44:29.626]  You already, although housing sales went up in May, you're seeing real big slowdowns everywhere.
[02:44:29.686 --> 02:44:37.048]  Your mortgage rate is almost double what it was a year ago.
[02:44:39.529 --> 02:44:42.770]  The higher the mortgage rates, the higher the interest rates, the deeper the economy falls.
[02:44:43.771 --> 02:44:51.373]  So what you need to do is you need to really fight for a new system.
[02:44:52.873 --> 02:45:01.698]  Because if the same criminal group is in charge of the government, we're going to go down big and we're going to go down hard and deadly.
[02:45:02.018 --> 02:45:03.999]  Because when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:45:04.980 --> 02:45:05.740]  Just look at history.
[02:45:07.161 --> 02:45:08.002]  I don't want to go into it.
[02:45:08.022 --> 02:45:09.682]  I've gone into it a hundred times.
[02:45:13.305 --> 02:45:14.285]  And this is going to fail.
[02:45:16.166 --> 02:45:27.015]   To me, the only way That we could change this is with a new political system.
[02:45:28.036 --> 02:45:33.217]  We have to get rid of the crime syndicate in there that have given us nothing but disaster.
[02:45:33.917 --> 02:45:36.698]  And the people, this one was better than that one.
[02:45:36.738 --> 02:45:37.819]  That's their argument.
[02:45:39.099 --> 02:45:40.619]  Donald Trump was better than Biden.
[02:45:44.081 --> 02:45:45.661]  McDonald's is better than Burger King.
[02:45:46.801 --> 02:45:48.282]  What have they done for we the people?
[02:45:48.802 --> 02:45:51.763]  Bottom line, what have they done for we the people?
[02:45:53.035 --> 02:45:54.156]  We need a new system.
[02:45:55.697 --> 02:45:56.778]  Without it, we're finished.
[02:45:58.439 --> 02:46:11.968]  This clown freak, Boris Johnson, he goes on, the cost to Western nation of defending Ukraine.
[02:46:12.449 --> 02:46:14.150]  Let's stop at that, clown boy.
[02:46:15.271 --> 02:46:24.616]   It's not my business as an American to defend Ukraine.
[02:46:24.797 --> 02:46:33.343]  Again, George Washington crossed the Delaware, really knew how to fight, not like you guys or girls.
[02:46:34.984 --> 02:46:41.288]  No foreign entanglements, warning us explicitly not to get involved with European ones.
[02:46:41.628 --> 02:46:43.870]  And don't say whether you like a country or dislike them.
[02:46:45.431 --> 02:47:16.297]   So how dare you say that we should be defending Ukraine and fat mouth You're probably too stupid and too arrogant to have read your Trends Journal when we wrote all about it back in 2014, how the United States overthrew the democratically elected government, the Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine, and formed the coup.
[02:47:17.318 --> 02:47:19.799]  Oh, the freedom and democracy that they're bringing, that kind?
[02:47:21.545 --> 02:47:29.630]  And Victoria Nuland, Google it up, December 2013, saying in Washington D.C.
[02:47:29.650 --> 02:47:42.719]  with a sign of Chevron over one shoulder and Standard Oil over the next, that the United States pumped in five trillion dollars to non-governmental organizations to bring democracy to Ukraine.
[02:47:42.739 --> 02:47:46.682]  It's a couple of months before the overthrow of the government.
[02:47:48.123 --> 02:47:54.898]   So when I got a clown boy like saying we should be Defending Ukraine.
[02:47:56.658 --> 02:47:58.238]  And quote, you ready?
[02:47:58.838 --> 02:48:12.701]  Everybody dig into your pockets because Clown Boy Johnson said that the price is worth paying for democracy and freedom.
[02:48:14.041 --> 02:48:16.621]  He's used that clown line I don't know how many times.
[02:48:16.921 --> 02:48:17.501]  The price?
[02:48:18.522 --> 02:48:20.522]  You mean the price of death and destruction?
[02:48:21.451 --> 02:48:22.272]  Hey, stupid!
[02:48:23.192 --> 02:48:30.357]  We said before the war started, they better negotiate a peace deal with Russia.
[02:48:30.377 --> 02:48:33.139]  Because you're not going to beat them.
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:37.903]  And now Russia controls some 20% of Ukraine.
[02:48:37.963 --> 02:48:38.623]  Controls it.
[02:48:39.584 --> 02:48:40.544]  You're not going to get it back.
[02:48:42.686 --> 02:48:46.669]  You could have made a deal, there wouldn't have been all this money spent, all this death and all destruction.
[02:48:47.930 --> 02:48:49.791]  Oh, why should we listen to you, Solenti?
[02:48:51.209 --> 02:48:52.970]  Soros doesn't give you any money.
[02:48:53.930 --> 02:48:55.411]  Gates wouldn't give you a penny.
[02:48:55.911 --> 02:48:57.092]  Buffett, not a dime.
[02:48:58.773 --> 02:49:00.094]  Why should we listen to you?
[02:49:00.114 --> 02:49:02.135]  A man of courage?
[02:49:03.375 --> 02:49:04.336]  Trends wisdom?
[02:49:05.916 --> 02:49:08.218]  Who fights for freedom, peace, and democracy?
[02:49:10.479 --> 02:49:14.601]  And has a trend forecasting record that I'll put up against anybody in the world?
[02:49:15.241 --> 02:49:16.802]  Show me your books, your magazines.
[02:49:18.422 --> 02:49:22.704]  Why should we support you for peace when you see World War III coming?
[02:49:22.724 --> 02:49:25.865]  A further decline of our lives.
[02:49:28.686 --> 02:49:33.587]  Stealing more of our money as prices go higher so the bigs could get bigger.
[02:49:34.648 --> 02:49:37.269]  Oh, you have a column in your magazine each week.
[02:49:38.389 --> 02:49:39.589]  Bigs getting bigger.
[02:49:39.408 --> 02:49:51.609]   And how merger and acquisition activity in 2020, 2021, the biggest climb ever as they
[02:49:51.609 --> 02:49:58.927]   jumped and juiced all that money into the pockets of the money junkies.
[02:49:58.927 --> 02:50:08.927]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:50:00.130 --> 02:50:03.331]  Why should we give you anything for peace?
[02:50:03.331 --> 02:50:10.090]  That's where we're at.
[02:50:10.090 --> 02:50:10.930]  Bye.
[02:50:11.113 --> 02:50:12.053]  Back to the economy.
[02:50:12.993 --> 02:50:14.114]  The markets are mixed.
[02:50:15.574 --> 02:50:19.174]   To me, It's going to get a lot, lot worse.
[02:50:22.536 --> 02:50:31.082]  Oil prices are going to continue to escalate, I forecast, as the sanctions worsen on Russia and more tensions escalate in the Middle East.
[02:50:35.284 --> 02:50:36.485]  Businesses are way off.
[02:50:36.525 --> 02:50:39.527]  This COVID war has destroyed them in ways that are unimaginable.
[02:50:40.808 --> 02:50:42.829]  Everywhere I go at night, the streets are dead.
[02:50:43.369 --> 02:50:43.569]  Dead.
[02:50:43.388 --> 02:50:49.628]  dead, 930 dead, dead.
[02:50:49.628 --> 02:50:51.628]  Unite for peace and die for war.
[02:50:51.609 --> 02:50:52.429]  Occupy Peace.
[02:50:53.329 --> 02:50:56.950]  And if you want to see history before it happens, subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[02:50:57.571 --> 02:51:00.592]  We're working so hard to give you the best we can, and we are.
[02:51:01.632 --> 02:51:08.334]  And if you want to prevail, prevail and prosper in these times, TrendsJournal.com, OccupyPeace.com.
[02:51:09.094 --> 02:51:13.376]  The Oscar winners give a press conference, and how to buy a sailboat.
[02:51:13.516 --> 02:51:21.996]   I guess my feeling at this point in time is maybe we need to Be completely a little bit more scary for the public.
[02:51:22.336 --> 02:51:29.580]  Especially with the Delta variant, which is the hardiest and most contagious variant we've seen to date, we need all the protection that we can get.
[02:51:29.640 --> 02:51:31.441]  That's why the vaccines are so effective.
[02:51:31.781 --> 02:51:34.903]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[02:51:35.487 --> 02:51:37.148]  We've got to get them vaccinated.
[02:51:37.668 --> 02:51:39.470]  And hopefully they will do it willingly.
[02:51:39.490 --> 02:51:45.373]  I think we really need to make it clear that there are privileges associated with being an American.
[02:51:45.393 --> 02:51:46.534]  We have to be more calm.
[02:51:46.574 --> 02:51:47.995]  We have to be more forceful.
[02:51:48.295 --> 02:51:52.157]  If you do not want to get vaccinated, you can work from home.
[02:51:52.498 --> 02:51:54.219]  You can homeschool your children.
[02:51:54.439 --> 02:51:55.680]  You can shop online.
[02:51:56.060 --> 02:51:57.501]  So where is this coming from?
[02:51:57.581 --> 02:52:00.663]  People saying, I'm now being forced to be vaccinated.
[02:52:00.843 --> 02:52:02.844]  If you want to travel, you better go get that vaccine.
[02:52:03.044 --> 02:52:07.769]  You should be wearing masks even when you are vaccinated if you are indoors.
[02:52:08.070 --> 02:52:11.714]  If you wish to have these privileges, you need to get vaccinated.
[02:52:11.734 --> 02:52:16.519]  We have to say something coming out, you know, you don't get vaccinated, you know you're going to die.
[02:52:16.418 --> 02:52:20.498]  I mean, let's just be really blunt on these people.
[02:52:20.498 --> 02:52:21.837]  Get vaccinated.
[02:52:21.837 --> 02:52:24.498]  Get vaccinated.
[02:52:24.498 --> 02:52:25.578]  Get vaccinated.
[02:52:25.578 --> 02:52:26.837]  Get vaccinated.
[02:52:26.837 --> 02:52:30.097]  (plane engine roaring)
[02:52:30.097 --> 02:52:57.718]   You've always thought you couldn't care-press on nails because of all the active things you do?
[02:52:57.813 --> 02:53:00.494]  Pre-colored in seven luscious hues.
[02:53:01.194 --> 02:53:06.657]  Just... Our impulses are being redirected.
[02:53:07.218 --> 02:53:12.501]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[02:53:12.901 --> 02:53:14.942]  These signals being sent through time.
[02:53:17.321 --> 02:53:19.302]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:53:19.882 --> 02:53:23.023]  Our signal has reached more than 2 billion people.
[02:53:23.924 --> 02:53:29.106]  But the enemy is now aware of the fact that we've broken through and are moving to block us on every front.
[02:53:29.726 --> 02:53:38.569]  The only way you're going to be able to see our videos and articles is to visit InfoWars.com itself and hand-share the videos and articles to everyone you know.
[02:53:39.130 --> 02:53:44.412]  The signal is getting through and is exposing and defeating the globalists when we're able to get it through.
[02:53:44.992 --> 02:53:50.317]  But they're admittedly expanding their operations to suppress us, so only you can boost the signal.
[02:53:50.917 --> 02:53:52.919]  Only you can defeat the globalists.
[02:53:53.220 --> 02:53:54.140]  We're in this together.
[02:53:54.601 --> 02:53:58.604]  I salute you for your work, and I ask all of you to redouble your efforts.
[02:53:58.684 --> 02:54:03.349]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are our resistance.
[02:54:03.709 --> 02:54:09.594]  So the worst possible thing you could do is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually make them worse.
[02:54:13.411 --> 02:54:16.073]  mRNA is messenger RNA.
[02:54:16.273 --> 02:54:24.740]  It's a message that's being sent from your DNA to your cells, telling your cells what to do to maintain health.
[02:54:25.341 --> 02:54:27.242]  In this case, create a protein.
[02:54:27.843 --> 02:54:35.229]  Any technology that does something brand new inside of our bodies needs to be watched for years, if not decades.
[02:54:35.973 --> 02:54:40.575]  If they tell you that it's safe and effective, they're lying because we don't have the data yet.
[02:54:41.176 --> 02:54:45.738]  They need to tell you that you are part of a stage four research experiment.
[02:54:45.878 --> 02:54:47.219]  You are the lab rat.
[02:54:47.599 --> 02:54:48.739]  You are the guinea pig.
[02:54:48.999 --> 02:54:51.040]  This is a scientific dictatorship.
[02:54:51.241 --> 02:54:54.642]  This is the greatest hoax and the greatest power grab in human history.
