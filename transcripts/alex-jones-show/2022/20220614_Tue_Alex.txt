[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  [Music]
[00:00:20.166 --> 00:00:21.087]  Tomorrow's News.
[00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:35.246]  today.
[00:00:35.625 --> 00:00:42.248]  The Republican Party stood to abolish slavery, and the Democrat Party stood to abolish the Republic.
[00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:54.454]  For years after the Civil War, the Democrat Party created Ku Klux Klan, killed black political leaders, kidnapped heads of families, and leaders of churches and community groups.
[00:00:55.334 --> 00:01:11.027]  In 1870, John Stevens, a Republican state senator who advocated for the rights of African Americans, was murdered in the Caswell County Courthouse by the Ku Klux Klan as part of a terror campaign being carried out by the Democrat Party.
[00:01:11.927 --> 00:01:24.735]  By the end of the century, the Democrat Party helped foster several radical left pro-communist groups, such as the National Labor Union, the Revolutionary Socialist Labor Party, and the Social Democratic Party.
[00:01:25.175 --> 00:01:34.581]  In the 1900s, the Democrat Party's new radical left began killing members of law enforcement and government officials in several major U.S.
[00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:34.961]  cities.
[00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:38.383]  Which culminated in 1920, when U.S.
[00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:45.287]  Attorney General Alexander Mitchell Palmer ordered a series of raids that targeted these leftist organizations.
[00:01:46.148 --> 00:01:52.592]  By the 1940s, the Democrat Party had to go underground with their communist plans to overthrow America.
[00:01:53.192 --> 00:01:54.593]  But this did not last long.
[00:01:55.113 --> 00:02:02.598]  The leftist media soon labeled this pro-American movement as McCarthyism and portrayed it as un-American.
[00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:17.668]  During the early 1970s, with the support of pop culture media, the Democrat Party's Weather Underground started riots, murdered police, and bombed government buildings, including the United States Capitol building.
[00:02:18.608 --> 00:02:35.220]  And today, the Democrat Party's anti-American communist crusade has grown into an unstoppable force with the support of Hollywood, the big banks, corporations, and private think tanks, as well as the majority of the Republican Party.
[00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:50.346]  Today, the Democrat Party's radical BLM and Antifa are able to murder Americans in cold blood and burn down cities while law enforcement defends them and the average American supports them.
[00:02:51.346 --> 00:02:58.930]  What we are witnessing today is the final act of the destruction of individual liberty, natural law, and the Bill of Rights.
[00:02:59.631 --> 00:03:08.976]  And what follows will be a tyranny unlike anything we have ever seen in recorded history, because the average American no longer cares about freedom.
[00:03:09.416 --> 00:03:20.042]  Today's liberal Democrats are all on board with illegal wars for profit, imprisoning their opposition, and exploiting the most innocent among us, our children.
[00:03:20.882 --> 00:03:30.588]  The American people have become fat, drunk, and stupid, with swollen egos incapable of seeing even the most minute flaw in their own character.
[00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:37.372]  The American people have become so dumbed down that all the enemy has to do is lie.
[00:03:37.873 --> 00:03:41.035]  And no matter how radical the lie is, they will believe it.
[00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:44.256]  Some of us would gladly die for freedom.
[00:03:44.796 --> 00:03:46.237]  Thousands already have.
[00:03:46.837 --> 00:03:50.539]  But unfortunately, most of us will do nothing but comply.
[00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:56.521]  The biggest cowards in all of human history can be found today in America.
[00:03:56.961 --> 00:04:01.563]  Because with only the slightest bit of courage, we could turn this all around.
[00:04:02.684 --> 00:04:04.985]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:06.778 --> 00:04:09.080]  An amazing piece there from Greg Reese.
[00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.442]  You can find it, of course, at Band.Video.
[00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:16.385]  Folks, I know I harp on this constantly, but I'm never going to quit.
[00:04:18.307 --> 00:04:20.868]  The Democrat Party was founded as a domestic terror group.
[00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.691]  It still exists as such to this day.
[00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:34.999]  And until we recognize that fact and deal with it in the proper manner, the destruction and terror that they bring to this country will not cease to exist.
[00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:52.743]  And we'll look back someday, if the Democrats' destruction of America continues, and we'll live in a third world hellhole, and we'll see the swaller and everything that comes with it, and we'll sit back and we'll look at ourselves, and we won't say, what happened?
[00:04:52.763 --> 00:04:53.504]  How did this happen?
[00:04:54.064 --> 00:04:55.645]  We'll know exactly how it happened.
[00:04:56.988 --> 00:04:59.289]  Because we know exactly how it's happening right now.
[00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.971]  With Joe Biden and the rest of the Democrat thieves and criminals.
[00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:10.535]  An honor to be with you on this Tuesday, June 14th, 2022.
[00:05:11.816 --> 00:05:12.536]  Flag day!
[00:05:13.356 --> 00:05:14.597]  No, not your gay flag.
[00:05:14.617 --> 00:05:16.398]  How about the American flag?
[00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:27.995]   As we are just 147 days away from the historic midterms, that almost certainly will determine The fate of the future of this country.
[00:05:28.716 --> 00:05:37.123]  More Democrat Party rule means more destruction, more poverty, more lies, more deception, more war.
[00:05:38.224 --> 00:05:49.573]  Or we can start to reverse that trend by getting a Republican-controlled Congress to try to mitigate the damage being done intentionally right now by the Biden regime.
[00:05:51.655 --> 00:05:52.736]  And I do have the latest.
[00:05:53.743 --> 00:05:56.584]  News here in front of me on what the Biden regime is up to.
[00:05:57.204 --> 00:06:01.885]  We have new record high increases in the producer price index.
[00:06:02.326 --> 00:06:06.087]  That just means the cost of producing goods is skyrocketing.
[00:06:07.207 --> 00:06:12.068]  And so, of course, in turn, the consumer price index also has record high gains.
[00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:14.209]  It's all by design, folks.
[00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.530]  Let's not act like this is a uncontrollable circumstance.
[00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:20.771]  Let's not act like this is something nobody saw coming.
[00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:36.284]  Everybody saw it coming, it's official Democrat Party policy, and it was actually put well to me by a friend of mine the other day, basically insinuating I should change my rhetoric, or that's kind of how I took it.
[00:06:36.704 --> 00:06:38.665]  It's not how it was proposed to me, but it's how I took it.
[00:06:39.885 --> 00:06:48.307]  Folks, you're not seeing inflation, well you are obviously seeing inflation, you are obviously seeing a recession, maybe even a depression.
[00:06:48.887 --> 00:06:50.448]  It's all these different things we can talk about.
[00:06:52.056 --> 00:07:03.804]  But the better understanding of it would be to understand that it's actually rationing already taking place on a global stage.
[00:07:04.704 --> 00:07:11.869]  The US has been too fat and happy, and so our leaders are now rationing us back down into poverty.
[00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:17.873]  We have too big of a middle class, so they're rationing that middle class down into lower classes.
[00:07:18.754 --> 00:07:19.835]  That's what's going on.
[00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:29.272]  When you're getting your energy shut off, when your food prices are skyrocketing and everything else, you're just learning to deal with rationing.
[00:07:29.672 --> 00:07:38.915]  You're just learning to deal with you no longer are going to have ease of access and excess in this country.
[00:07:38.995 --> 00:07:50.025]   No, you're going to be trained to be poor and hungry That's the new rationing of the new world order that the Democrats and Biden are bringing to us.
[00:07:50.085 --> 00:07:52.647]  So yeah, you can sit here and say, hey, it's a recession.
[00:07:53.087 --> 00:07:55.048]  Hey, it's record high inflation.
[00:07:55.088 --> 00:07:57.689]  It's record high consumer price index, producer price index.
[00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:04.313]  You can actually look at all the data and the numbers and the variables and all the stuff, and it's very comprehensible.
[00:08:05.734 --> 00:08:06.554]  You're just living it.
[00:08:06.614 --> 00:08:07.995]  You don't even need to look at the numbers.
[00:08:08.015 --> 00:08:13.298]  You're living double your energy prices, double your price of the pump, double your grocery bill.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:26.909]  You're being taught all by design that no more, no more abundance, no more excess, no more bountiful harvests.
[00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:27.530]  You're done.
[00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:28.531]  You're done, America.
[00:08:28.751 --> 00:08:29.051]  You're done.
[00:08:31.453 --> 00:08:50.488]   And Biden told you all of this, that he would do all of this before he got into office, and it's The Democrat Party officially signed on to the globalist New World Order, World Economic Forum, Bilderberg Group, World Health Organization, global government.
[00:08:51.277 --> 00:08:58.519]  That uses man-made climate change as their number one cause to cease human activity on this planet.
[00:08:59.099 --> 00:09:01.140]  So, you having your A.C.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:21.965]   running all day, you having four flat screens in your house, you having a refrigerator in your kitchen full, and a refrigerator in your basement full, and a refrigerator in your garage full, or a deep freezer full, two cars in the garage, one outside for Junior, a pool in the back, all that stuff, all the American life, The American way of life?
[00:09:22.385 --> 00:09:22.865]  Dead!
[00:09:25.566 --> 00:09:27.447]  You've had too much, cockroach!
[00:09:30.087 --> 00:09:33.768]  That's the attitude of the World Economic Forum.
[00:09:33.808 --> 00:09:35.948]  That's the attitude of the World Health Organization.
[00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:37.949]  That's the attitude of our political leaders.
[00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:44.931]  And they're just so out of touch with reality, there's almost this gamemanship that goes on in D.C.
[00:09:45.491 --> 00:09:46.171]  with the D.C.
[00:09:46.191 --> 00:09:50.713]   elites When they go meet with other world leaders, they brag!
[00:09:51.513 --> 00:09:53.914]  They brag about how they've gotten America to heal.
[00:09:54.474 --> 00:09:56.615]  They brag about how they've shut off our energy.
[00:09:57.755 --> 00:10:03.377]  They show up to these global events and they brag about how they're crushing the American people.
[00:10:05.298 --> 00:10:18.185]   Because they think that's virtuous, because America has had it so good for so long, such prosperity, such ease of access, such abundance, That the world hated us for it.
[00:10:18.645 --> 00:10:21.546]  And so now our leaders say, well we'll crush the American people.
[00:10:21.566 --> 00:10:22.507]  Will you like us then?
[00:10:23.167 --> 00:10:24.167]  Will you respect us then?
[00:10:24.487 --> 00:10:24.728]  Look!
[00:10:25.648 --> 00:10:26.188]  Look at us!
[00:10:27.229 --> 00:10:28.709]  We've doubled their gas prices.
[00:10:28.869 --> 00:10:30.290]  We've doubled their grocery prices.
[00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.711]  We've doubled their energy prices.
[00:10:31.811 --> 00:10:32.071]  See?
[00:10:32.131 --> 00:10:33.191]  We're crushing America.
[00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:34.612]  We're crushing our people.
[00:10:35.792 --> 00:10:45.882]   And they go and brag At these international consortiums about how they're crushing the American people because it's so bad what we do for climate change.
[00:10:46.363 --> 00:10:48.164]  Oh, except the U.S.
[00:10:48.204 --> 00:10:52.027]  is actually probably the most green industrial nation on the planet.
[00:10:52.347 --> 00:10:53.088]  It's not even close.
[00:10:54.749 --> 00:10:55.910]  But that's not even the point.
[00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:00.773]  That's just this little game that the D.C.
[00:11:00.813 --> 00:11:03.115]  elite play that they don't tell you about.
[00:11:04.261 --> 00:11:09.422]  So that they can go to these international groups and brag about how they've crushed the American people.
[00:11:11.383 --> 00:11:16.224]  But that's what's so odd about it is Joe Biden campaigns with his five campaign events.
[00:11:16.244 --> 00:11:20.766]  He could fit 10 campaigns in one large automobile.
[00:11:21.726 --> 00:11:24.127]  One extended cab automobile can have 10 Biden rallies in it.
[00:11:25.327 --> 00:11:26.747]  But no, he campaigns.
[00:11:26.787 --> 00:11:28.988]  He goes up to people, he says, we're ending fossil fuels.
[00:11:29.308 --> 00:11:30.368]  We're gonna take the guns.
[00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:32.009]  Like he campaigns on all of it.
[00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:35.882]  Oh, we're gonna raise taxes, shut down the energy.
[00:11:37.083 --> 00:11:40.127]  And then all of it happens, and people shake their heads, they can't even believe it.
[00:11:40.147 --> 00:11:43.771]  I mean, Biden told you he would do all this.
[00:11:47.695 --> 00:11:49.397]  So, I've got a stack of that news.
[00:11:49.457 --> 00:11:52.981]  By the way, another food processing plant burned to the ground.
[00:11:54.150 --> 00:12:01.175]  Other food processing plants in California are being closed because they're being priced out of existence by the Democrats in California.
[00:12:01.315 --> 00:12:02.095]  So they don't even hide it.
[00:12:02.236 --> 00:12:06.098]  Smithfield Foods plant in California, they say, yeah, we're shutting down.
[00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:10.741]  Media says, well, this is one of the biggest food manufacturing plants in California.
[00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:11.442]  Why are you shutting down?
[00:12:11.462 --> 00:12:12.843]  He says, can't afford to work here.
[00:12:14.364 --> 00:12:16.806]  Can't afford to exist in California.
[00:12:17.186 --> 00:12:18.927]  We're being taxed out the wazoo.
[00:12:18.967 --> 00:12:20.308]  Can't afford to produce food anymore.
[00:12:20.328 --> 00:12:21.229]  So we're closing our doors.
[00:12:22.219 --> 00:12:23.220]  How does that work out?
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.421]  But see, again, the Democrats applaud that.
[00:12:25.461 --> 00:12:26.302]  They think that's good.
[00:12:26.582 --> 00:12:27.723]  Hey, less consumers.
[00:12:28.744 --> 00:12:30.885]  Hey, less carbon emissions.
[00:12:30.926 --> 00:12:31.346]  That's good.
[00:12:31.386 --> 00:12:32.407]  Shut down the economy.
[00:12:32.667 --> 00:12:33.808]  Shut down the manufacturing.
[00:12:33.828 --> 00:12:36.330]  That's a good thing, according to Democrats.
[00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:37.931]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up, folks.
[00:12:37.951 --> 00:12:39.932]  These people are completely out of reality.
[00:12:40.853 --> 00:12:42.654]  They're lost in a world that doesn't exist.
[00:12:43.735 --> 00:12:45.837]  They're driven by hatred and lust for power.
[00:12:47.038 --> 00:12:48.559]  And we're all just the victims of it.
[00:12:49.745 --> 00:12:56.150]  And why we're still putting up with the Democrat Party in the year 2022 in this country is absurd.
[00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:07.217]  This scourge, the Democrat Party, this scourge, this cancer, this demon, should have been eradicated from America long, long ago.
[00:13:07.637 --> 00:13:11.000]  But here we are still dealing with it, and now it's crushing us.
[00:13:13.645 --> 00:13:16.467]  Oh, the Democrats started as a terrorist group?
[00:13:16.647 --> 00:13:17.027]  I know.
[00:13:17.487 --> 00:13:19.188]  That's why they haven't changed to this day.
[00:13:19.208 --> 00:13:23.250]  I've got unbelievable news about what's going on in D.C.
[00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.350]  with the Democrats right now.
[00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:29.893]  They're all poised to riot as soon as the Roe vs. Wade decision drops.
[00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:44.088]  And they have what they call jail liaisons or jail support because, well, why would you go to a peaceful protest with lawyers and bail bondsmen ready to bail you out of jail?
[00:13:44.328 --> 00:13:47.332]  Because they plan on committing crimes, folks.
[00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:49.494]  Because it's a criminal group.
[00:13:49.774 --> 00:13:55.377]  It's a domestic terror group called the Democrat Party that we're still dealing with in this country.
[00:13:55.717 --> 00:13:59.519]  It blows my mind that we're still dealing with these groups.
[00:14:00.119 --> 00:14:01.100]  But I'll tell you the latest.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:04.021]  They even call themselves Shut Down DC.
[00:14:04.722 --> 00:14:04.842]  Oh!
[00:14:05.442 --> 00:14:06.943]  Does that sound like an insurrection?
[00:14:07.323 --> 00:14:08.284]  Shut Down DC?
[00:14:09.639 --> 00:14:11.740]  That's the name of their group, Shut Down D.C.
[00:14:12.461 --> 00:14:13.261]  But you're not allowed.
[00:14:13.301 --> 00:14:15.423]  You're a conservative, you're a Christian, you're a Trump voter.
[00:14:15.703 --> 00:14:18.044]  You're not allowed to even breathe in D.C.
[00:14:19.605 --> 00:14:22.387]  They won't even let you breathe if they continue this pace in five years.
[00:14:22.407 --> 00:14:24.689]  They'll probably just throw you in a jail and just put a bullet in your head.
[00:14:25.909 --> 00:14:27.090]  It's the Democrat Party for you.
[00:14:28.071 --> 00:14:30.732]  But they get to have their groups called Shut Down D.C.
[00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:40.897]  That terrorize Supreme Court justices and try to murder people, and they have lawyers and bail bondsmen that walk around with them in the case where they commit a crime and they get arrested.
[00:14:41.457 --> 00:14:43.459]  You know, let me do a proper introduction here.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:15:04.629]   Roger Stone is joining me in studio in the next hour, and we'll be discussing all the latest news with Roger, and then he's going to be hosting himself ahead of The fourth hour host today, which is Wayne Allen Root.
[00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.390]  So, let me just do this.
[00:15:10.211 --> 00:15:15.212]  Let me get into this stack of news and I'll start to roll off some of these shocking clips that we have from Democrats.
[00:15:15.352 --> 00:15:22.615]  I mean, what Chris Coons said on Fox News and then what Karine Jean-Pierre was saying yesterday is just unbelievable stuff.
[00:15:23.797 --> 00:15:32.028]  Then we'll get into the Democrat terrorism that they're allowed to engage in that, but if you're a Trump supporter, you take a breath of fresh air in D.C.
[00:15:32.088 --> 00:15:40.559]  or step on a blade of grass, they're going to be looking to arrest you sometime between now and the year 2050, whenever it's convenient for them.
[00:15:40.859 --> 00:15:42.181]  I'm not joking about that, by the way.
[00:15:43.416 --> 00:15:53.300]  If this charade, this sham of January 6th continues, the Democrats will be arresting people for the next 30 years in connection with January 6th.
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.180]  Of course they will be.
[00:15:54.481 --> 00:15:58.702]  Look at what they just did to the leading GOP candidate for governor in Michigan.
[00:15:59.142 --> 00:16:00.243]  Oh, he's leading in the polls?
[00:16:00.423 --> 00:16:02.024]  Eh, let's go arrest him for January 6th.
[00:16:02.104 --> 00:16:02.584]  Perfect.
[00:16:02.724 --> 00:16:03.124]  Perfect.
[00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:04.805]  It's what they do.
[00:16:04.865 --> 00:16:05.545]  They're terrorists.
[00:16:05.625 --> 00:16:06.285]  They're Democrats.
[00:16:06.385 --> 00:16:12.468]  Again, why we still deal with this domestic terror group and hate group in this country is just mind-blowing.
[00:16:13.459 --> 00:16:14.059]  But we do it!
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.342]  We do it for at least one more day.
[00:16:18.903 --> 00:16:20.304]  But here's some of the economic news.
[00:16:21.044 --> 00:16:27.369]  May producer price index soars to 10.8% as energy costs reach daily record highs.
[00:16:27.889 --> 00:16:31.051]  I mean, liberals aren't very smart people, so they don't get it.
[00:16:33.053 --> 00:16:35.734]  We need to stop fossil fuels.
[00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:38.817]  We need to stop carbon emissions.
[00:16:40.382 --> 00:16:41.523]  Okay, so what do you do?
[00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:43.224]  You shut off American energy?
[00:16:43.404 --> 00:16:43.824]  Great.
[00:16:44.164 --> 00:16:45.105]  Smart move.
[00:16:45.165 --> 00:16:46.025]  What's going to happen?
[00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:48.026]  Oh, now gas prices are reaching record highs.
[00:16:48.187 --> 00:16:49.287]  Oh, who could have seen that coming?
[00:16:49.507 --> 00:16:50.448]  Not a liberal, they're stupid.
[00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:54.030]  So, oh, now gas prices go up.
[00:16:55.151 --> 00:17:00.974]  So if gas prices double, they've actually more than doubled now, they're going to be tripled, actually.
[00:17:01.414 --> 00:17:05.276]  Probably in July, gas prices will have tripled under Joe Biden.
[00:17:05.717 --> 00:17:09.019]  And I would say also in or by July, you're going to see $10 a gallon gas.
[00:17:10.131 --> 00:17:11.592]  We made that prediction right here first.
[00:17:12.472 --> 00:17:13.813]  Not that hard of a prediction to make.
[00:17:16.714 --> 00:17:25.498]  So, what do you think happens to the people that distribute the food and move the food and the goods across the country and the planet?
[00:17:25.518 --> 00:17:26.819]  What do you think happens to them?
[00:17:27.299 --> 00:17:28.699]  Their prices go up.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.942]  And when their prices go up, your price goes up.
[00:17:35.808 --> 00:17:37.289]  Oh, now you can't afford to live!
[00:17:37.469 --> 00:17:37.889]  Wow!
[00:17:38.189 --> 00:17:38.830]  No kidding!
[00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:40.110]  Duh!
[00:17:41.151 --> 00:17:43.932]  That's the whole idea of the Green New Deal!
[00:17:44.632 --> 00:17:47.574]  That's the whole idea of the Paris Climate Accord!
[00:17:48.154 --> 00:17:50.495]  That's the whole idea of stopping man-made climate change!
[00:17:51.035 --> 00:17:52.296]  You don't live anymore!
[00:17:53.196 --> 00:17:54.477]  You are the problem!
[00:17:54.597 --> 00:17:55.618]  You emit carbon!
[00:17:55.838 --> 00:17:56.898]  You drive a car!
[00:17:57.198 --> 00:17:58.339]  You have air conditioning!
[00:17:58.699 --> 00:18:00.240]  You must be shut down!
[00:18:01.937 --> 00:18:08.719]  But again, liberals exist in this odd vacuum where they think that all the stuff they want to apply to their political enemy doesn't apply to them.
[00:18:09.319 --> 00:18:17.421]  No, you're still paying more for food, you're still paying more for energy too, and then they're ticked off and they demand student loan debt relief.
[00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:19.322]  What a scam that would be.
[00:18:21.643 --> 00:18:22.243]  But they'll do it.
[00:18:25.704 --> 00:18:26.464]  They'll do it.
[00:18:29.639 --> 00:18:35.064]  Real inflation for the vast majority of Americans is far higher than what's being reported.
[00:18:35.584 --> 00:18:41.189]  Steve Cortez breaks down massive 25% increase in necessities like gas, food, and utilities.
[00:18:41.209 --> 00:18:42.430]  It's more than 25%, folks.
[00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:43.972]  It's doubled.
[00:18:44.872 --> 00:18:46.033]  It has doubled.
[00:18:46.214 --> 00:18:50.417]  I mean, I don't have to look outside my own life.
[00:18:50.978 --> 00:18:58.196]   My energy bills to cool my home have Not doubled, but 25% is probably where it's at right now.
[00:18:58.276 --> 00:18:58.736]  I'd say about 25%.
[00:18:59.077 --> 00:19:02.920]  I mean, you can go look at your own bill.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.201]  It's probably like me.
[00:19:04.221 --> 00:19:05.101]  You have it all online.
[00:19:05.422 --> 00:19:19.713]  I can go look, and I can see June 2020, June 2021, June 2022, and I can see that if I'm paying, I think it was like, I forget the exact number.
[00:19:19.733 --> 00:19:20.173]  It was something like $130.
[00:19:24.485 --> 00:19:35.397]  To, for my electric bill in June 2020, and my last electric bill was like 183 last month.
[00:19:36.999 --> 00:19:38.921]  So, I mean, you can go look at that for yourself.
[00:19:39.141 --> 00:19:40.602]  You're experiencing that for yourself.
[00:19:40.622 --> 00:19:41.243]  I don't have to tell you.
[00:19:42.164 --> 00:19:44.667]  And now the food processing plants burning down continues.
[00:19:44.687 --> 00:19:45.488]  We've got another one.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:54.393]  Multiple crews responding to a fire at food manufacturing facility near Portage, Wapaka County line.
[00:19:54.433 --> 00:19:55.454]  This is in Wisconsin.
[00:19:56.837 --> 00:19:59.381]  Festive Food LLC manufacturing.
[00:20:00.405 --> 00:20:07.768]  A massive fire and they're shutting down their facility for now and they're going to try to rebuild and get it operational as soon as possible.
[00:20:07.828 --> 00:20:16.031]  But another, I mean what, 30, 40, 50 fires at food plants, food processing plants, manufacturing plants, fertilizer plants.
[00:20:16.231 --> 00:20:17.291]  What is going on here?
[00:20:18.452 --> 00:20:20.913]  Ask Merrick Garland, he has no idea.
[00:20:21.849 --> 00:20:22.289]  No clue.
[00:20:22.349 --> 00:20:24.251]  Ask the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:20:24.271 --> 00:20:25.391]  They don't have a clue either.
[00:20:26.372 --> 00:20:31.015]  So those are just food processing plants burning to the ground that we don't get any answers on.
[00:20:31.075 --> 00:20:32.396]  Is that more Democrat terrorism?
[00:20:32.416 --> 00:20:32.857]  I don't know.
[00:20:33.397 --> 00:20:34.037]  I don't get any answers.
[00:20:34.097 --> 00:20:35.558]  Is it a space weapon from China?
[00:20:35.618 --> 00:20:35.919]  I don't know.
[00:20:35.939 --> 00:20:36.619]  I don't get any answers.
[00:20:36.639 --> 00:20:37.560]  I don't get an investigation.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.201]  I'm just supposed to believe that's normal.
[00:20:39.821 --> 00:20:41.102]  But this is the Democrats.
[00:20:41.142 --> 00:20:41.683]  We know that.
[00:20:42.163 --> 00:20:46.506]  Smithfield Foods citing high cost of operating in California to close pork plant.
[00:20:47.568 --> 00:20:58.830]  It's one of the biggest plants in California, and it actually was one of the biggest in the United States, even, for processing pork, and they're shutting down, and they said, we can't afford to operate in California.
[00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:01.151]  Yeah, that's the whole point, folks!
[00:21:01.251 --> 00:21:04.772]  I wish people could understand this.
[00:21:05.552 --> 00:21:06.252]  I really wish.
[00:21:06.352 --> 00:21:11.113]  And I'm not lecturing the audience, most of you probably understand this, and maybe it's a fool's errand.
[00:21:12.346 --> 00:21:18.912]  To even try to explain this on the air, because liberals and Democrats are either not going to listen or not get it, or maybe they like it.
[00:21:20.493 --> 00:21:25.798]  Don't you see the entire Democrat economic policy does just this?
[00:21:26.038 --> 00:21:28.140]  It prices you out of existence.
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.441]  That's the point.
[00:21:29.961 --> 00:21:31.502]  You can't exist anymore.
[00:21:31.923 --> 00:21:32.703]  You're bad.
[00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:34.765]  You're causing man-made climate change.
[00:21:36.787 --> 00:21:51.930]   The whole idea The whole idea of Build Back Better, the whole idea of the Great Reset, is to create a new global economy where the individual cannot exist, cannot thrive, cannot prosper.
[00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:55.733]  That is the entire purpose.
[00:21:57.975 --> 00:22:02.058]  When they say they want to stop man-made climate change, take climate change out of the equation.
[00:22:02.278 --> 00:22:03.959]  They want to stop man.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.561]  They want to stop you.
[00:22:07.113 --> 00:22:11.816]  So Smithfield closes their processing plant and says, yeah, I mean, Democrats price us out of existence.
[00:22:11.836 --> 00:22:12.376]  What do you want us to do?
[00:22:14.538 --> 00:22:18.140]  Literally can't operate in California, can't produce food for people.
[00:22:20.361 --> 00:22:20.942]  We're shutting down.
[00:22:21.902 --> 00:22:28.126]  That is the entire Green New Deal, Paris Climate Accord, Build Back Better, Great Reset in a nutshell.
[00:22:29.107 --> 00:22:30.388]  How can people not see this?
[00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:32.651]  Or maybe they are seeing this.
[00:22:33.832 --> 00:22:35.534]  Women now can't get tampons.
[00:22:35.554 --> 00:22:37.136]  There's a tampon shortage in America.
[00:22:37.536 --> 00:22:45.465]  We're not sure if this is due to the Biden economy or if this is because liberals are putting tampons in boys' bathrooms now, but that's going on.
[00:22:47.085 --> 00:22:50.728]  Americans dismayed and furious with Biden administration over soaring inflation.
[00:22:50.928 --> 00:22:54.391]  Yeah, you go out and do a man-on-the-street interview, folks, you go anywhere.
[00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:58.694]  Outside a grocery store, gas station, and it's Americans from all different walks of life.
[00:22:58.834 --> 00:23:05.680]  In fact, the only ones are white liberals are the only ones that seem to be embracing the collapse of America, thanks to themselves and Joe Biden.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:09.643]  You ask any rational thinking person, they know Biden is crushing this country.
[00:23:09.683 --> 00:23:10.584]  They know it's Democrats.
[00:23:11.024 --> 00:23:14.667]  Remember when a bunch of Trump supporters started a group called Shut Down DC?
[00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:26.441]  And then they were terrorizing Supreme Court justices and trying to kill them at their houses and doxing their private addresses and then even doxing the addresses of their children's schools so they could terrorize those too.
[00:23:26.461 --> 00:23:27.482]  Remember when Trump supporters were doing that?
[00:23:27.963 --> 00:23:30.385]  Oh no, I'm sorry, I got confused.
[00:23:30.746 --> 00:23:32.127]  That's the Democrats.
[00:23:32.608 --> 00:23:33.409]  My bad, guys.
[00:23:33.489 --> 00:23:34.230]  Honest mistake.
[00:23:34.690 --> 00:23:36.012]  That's the Democrats again.
[00:23:36.493 --> 00:23:38.576]  The largest domestic terror group in the history of this country.
[00:23:38.616 --> 00:23:39.918]  The Democrats are still at it.
[00:23:40.438 --> 00:23:46.527]  Shutdown DC group plans blockade at Supreme Court with jail support on hand.
[00:23:46.868 --> 00:23:46.968]  Oh!
[00:23:47.348 --> 00:23:47.989]  Jail support?
[00:23:49.119 --> 00:23:50.240]  Shut down D.C.
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:53.822]  That's the name of the leftist group that's terrorizing the streets of D.C.
[00:23:53.842 --> 00:23:54.403]  to this day.
[00:23:54.923 --> 00:24:02.989]  It's mostly just grumpy, fat, obese women and deranged-looking, skinny, jean-wearing libtards.
[00:24:03.489 --> 00:24:04.550]  But they're out there.
[00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:05.070]  They're at it.
[00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:06.832]  They're threatening Supreme Court justices.
[00:24:06.852 --> 00:24:07.712]  They're trying to kill them.
[00:24:07.972 --> 00:24:09.453]  They're going to their private addresses.
[00:24:09.473 --> 00:24:11.275]  They're banging on the doors of the Supreme Court.
[00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:16.913]  And they're just waiting to have a total ride on their hands as soon as the Rovers-Wade decision is dropped.
[00:24:16.933 --> 00:24:25.557]  So the Democrats are just keeping their terrorists out on the streets as a check against Rovers-Wade being overturned, which it would then just go to the states.
[00:24:25.757 --> 00:24:27.138]  So I don't know what the big thing here is.
[00:24:27.158 --> 00:24:29.800]  I guess Democrats just really love terrorism.
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.420]  And so there you're seeing some of the stuff.
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.181]  So it's Shut Down DC is the group.
[00:24:34.201 --> 00:24:37.022]  Can you imagine if a group of Trump supporters called themselves Shut Down DC?
[00:24:37.322 --> 00:24:38.542]  They'd all be arrested yesterday.
[00:24:38.722 --> 00:24:41.202]  But oh, Libs, they're allowed to do it, Democrats.
[00:24:41.483 --> 00:24:51.685]  And they have lawyers and bail bondsmen that travel around with these terrorists because they're expecting to commit crimes and be arrested.
[00:24:53.066 --> 00:24:54.590]  Just amazing stuff, isn't it?
[00:24:55.192 --> 00:24:59.324]  They are really a well-organized, well-trained, well-oiled terror group.
[00:24:59.725 --> 00:25:00.728]  It's the Democrat Party.
[00:25:02.219 --> 00:25:05.823]  And Biden completely is in bed with these people.
[00:25:05.863 --> 00:25:12.230]  Biden's White House hosted several defund the police activists over the last year, visitor log show.
[00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:18.076]  You know, real quickly, I don't know if I have the story on my desk today, but did you know there was another attempted shooting in Texas?
[00:25:18.417 --> 00:25:20.139]  It was either this morning or yesterday, I forget.
[00:25:20.719 --> 00:25:21.600]  And you know what happened?
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.082]  A policeman stopped him.
[00:25:24.295 --> 00:25:24.756]  That's right.
[00:25:25.036 --> 00:25:27.359]  But we should defund those police and disarm the citizens.
[00:25:27.679 --> 00:25:30.503]  That way we can have mass shootings killing hundreds of people in this country.
[00:25:30.563 --> 00:25:31.584]  Democrats would love that.
[00:25:32.205 --> 00:25:32.686]  Less people?
[00:25:32.766 --> 00:25:33.487]  Democrats love that.
[00:25:33.527 --> 00:25:34.068]  They hate people.
[00:25:35.369 --> 00:25:37.111]  You know, because they're causing climate change after all.
[00:25:37.151 --> 00:25:38.073]  But that's another story.
[00:25:39.034 --> 00:25:40.275]  Back to the Democrat terrorists.
[00:25:40.836 --> 00:25:41.537]  Yeah, in Duncanville.
[00:25:41.557 --> 00:25:41.918]  There it is.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.161]  So, uh, tried to kill kids at a summer camp.
[00:25:45.181 --> 00:25:46.262]  Policeman with a gun stopped it.
[00:25:46.382 --> 00:25:46.822]  Oh, what do you know?
[00:25:46.842 --> 00:25:49.184]  A good guy with a gun at the scene stops the shooter?
[00:25:49.344 --> 00:25:50.645]  Who could have figured that logic out?
[00:25:50.705 --> 00:25:51.705]  Certainly not a Democrat.
[00:25:52.266 --> 00:25:53.406]  They still haven't figured it out.
[00:25:53.726 --> 00:25:55.588]  It could happen a hundred times they wouldn't figure it out.
[00:25:56.108 --> 00:25:56.488]  D.C.
[00:25:56.528 --> 00:25:58.890]  Mayor ups police presence ahead of protests.
[00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:00.370]  Says cities won't live in fear.
[00:26:00.851 --> 00:26:00.971]  Oh!
[00:26:02.592 --> 00:26:02.652]  Oh!
[00:26:04.111 --> 00:26:09.558]  Oh, we're adding security now because Democrat terrorists are outside in Washington, D.C.
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:10.940]  I see.
[00:26:11.821 --> 00:26:13.724]  And now they're admitting that that's the case.
[00:26:15.306 --> 00:26:15.887]  I gotcha.
[00:26:16.728 --> 00:26:17.189]  Okay.
[00:26:18.558 --> 00:26:22.262]  But let's recall, and this is the New York Times, they're even admitting it, folks.
[00:26:22.783 --> 00:26:27.408]  Police told to hold back on Capitol riot response report fines.
[00:26:27.628 --> 00:26:28.509]  That's the New York Times.
[00:26:28.569 --> 00:26:29.109]  So, oh!
[00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:34.175]  Trump calls Pelosi and says, hey, we should have 10,000 National Guard out there on January 6th.
[00:26:34.215 --> 00:26:35.216]  Pelosi says, no thanks.
[00:26:37.258 --> 00:26:44.171]   And then it was, I can't remember who it was, it was either Maybe Radcliffe or someone else from the Trump administration reached out to the D.C.
[00:26:44.191 --> 00:26:48.072]  mayor and said, hey, we should have added police on the day of January 6th.
[00:26:48.092 --> 00:26:49.953]  There's going to be more than a million people in D.C.
[00:26:51.113 --> 00:26:52.393]  Mario Bowser said, no, thanks.
[00:26:52.493 --> 00:26:56.375]  Actually, we're going to we're going to have less police on that day.
[00:26:57.375 --> 00:26:57.795]  Amazing.
[00:26:59.216 --> 00:27:00.416]  Really incredible stuff there.
[00:27:02.128 --> 00:27:04.069]  Back to today's Democrat terrorism.
[00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:11.915]  Ruth Sent Us group hinted at targeting Supreme Court Justice Barrett's children and her church.
[00:27:13.236 --> 00:27:19.241]  Well, hinting at it wasn't enough for these scumbags, and so they've actually done it now!
[00:27:19.761 --> 00:27:30.309]  Pro-choice protesters post school information on the children of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and now they're going to show up at her children's schools to terrorize children.
[00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:32.081]  Nice.
[00:27:32.761 --> 00:27:33.862]  That's a good look, don't you think?
[00:27:34.162 --> 00:27:38.823]  That's a good look for the Democrats to show up at schools after a mass shooting happened.
[00:27:39.303 --> 00:27:39.763]  Remember that?
[00:27:40.484 --> 00:27:46.125]  I think it's a good idea for Democrats to show up and terrorize schools less than a month after a mass shooting.
[00:27:46.646 --> 00:27:47.726]  Good idea, Democrats.
[00:27:47.846 --> 00:27:48.546]  Keep it up.
[00:27:48.926 --> 00:27:50.667]  Go terrorize those kids, libs.
[00:27:51.247 --> 00:27:53.968]  Go show the world what a bunch of terrorists you are.
[00:27:54.768 --> 00:27:55.848]  Most of us already know it.
[00:27:56.168 --> 00:27:57.669]  The rest of us are starting to realize it.
[00:27:58.775 --> 00:28:07.421]  So sadly, if your child goes to school with Amy Coney Barrett's kids, expect Democrat terrorists to show up very soon, I would imagine.
[00:28:07.881 --> 00:28:09.963]  And they continue to burn pregnancy centers to the ground.
[00:28:10.443 --> 00:28:12.504]  It's the liberal summer of rage after all.
[00:28:12.865 --> 00:28:16.307]  Pro-abortion terrorists firebomb Oregon Pregnancy Center.
[00:28:16.327 --> 00:28:16.988]  What is this, the 10th?
[00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:19.540]  Tenth this month, I think.
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:23.923]  Ten pregnancy centers firebombed by Democrat terrorists.
[00:28:24.464 --> 00:28:26.025]  It's the liberal summer of rage.
[00:28:26.665 --> 00:28:28.407]  After all, that's what they do.
[00:28:29.047 --> 00:28:31.489]  And it's not just pregnancy centers the liberals are terrorizing.
[00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:38.335]  Arsonists with a hammer and flare attack office of GOP lawmaker in Washington state.
[00:28:39.656 --> 00:28:45.981]  Two male appearing terrorists attack the office of Washington state rep Andrew Barkas.
[00:28:47.182 --> 00:28:52.666]  Yesterday morning, smashing windows and lighting the building on fire.
[00:28:54.167 --> 00:28:56.309]  Democrats doing what Democrats do.
[00:28:56.929 --> 00:28:57.510]  Terrorism.
[00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:59.631]  Closed for fumigation!
[00:28:59.711 --> 00:29:04.655]  BLM chapter co-founder arrested after hundreds of cockroaches released in New York courthouse.
[00:29:04.815 --> 00:29:05.416]  Oh, what's that?
[00:29:06.637 --> 00:29:11.520]  One of the BLM chapter founders was in court, facing arraignment.
[00:29:13.181 --> 00:29:21.953]   So, The BLM activists decided they were going to put cockroaches into the courtroom to shut it down, and they did.
[00:29:22.473 --> 00:29:23.434]  Democrat terrorism.
[00:29:23.974 --> 00:29:29.135]  Antifa members who brutally beat-robbed two Latino Marines will get no jail time.
[00:29:29.896 --> 00:29:34.837]  All charges dropped by Soros-backed Philadelphia District Attorney.
[00:29:35.417 --> 00:29:38.098]  Yes, that's why they commit their criminal acts.
[00:29:38.778 --> 00:29:48.159]   That's why they can engage in domestic terror without any fear of consequence because the Democrat terrorists run everything.
[00:29:48.199 --> 00:29:52.746]  They run the courts, they run the district attorneys, they run the streets, they run the White House.
[00:29:52.786 --> 00:29:53.407]  They're terrorists.
[00:29:54.329 --> 00:29:54.609]  But see...
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:59.521]  Some people are starting to realize this, folks, and there's a story in the Intercept today.
[00:30:00.682 --> 00:30:03.523]  The headline doesn't really do this, but here's the headline for you.
[00:30:03.923 --> 00:30:12.906]  Elephant in the Zoom, meltdowns have brought progressive advocacy groups to a standstill at a criminal moment, critical moment in world history.
[00:30:13.346 --> 00:30:22.450]  And it's basically how you see all these leftist groups, and it's run by leftists and liberals, but at the top they're extremists, they're terrorists.
[00:30:23.459 --> 00:30:32.762]  And so the moderate and the centrist that might consider itself a liberal is sitting there watching all this, scratching their head like, I didn't know we were just straight-up domestic terrorists.
[00:30:32.902 --> 00:30:34.463]  I didn't know we were just straight-up evil people.
[00:30:34.903 --> 00:30:38.244]  I thought we were just bleeding-heart liberals that wanted to do what's good for the planet.
[00:30:38.664 --> 00:30:45.847]  And they're slowly realizing, no, the people that you call your leaders are actually avowed terrorists and demons.
[00:30:48.228 --> 00:30:53.159]   Young Dems more likely to despise the other party Yeah, that's right.
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:31:02.083]  College students who would not date someone, or support a business with someone, or be friends with someone who voted for the opposing presidential candidate.
[00:31:02.103 --> 00:31:05.585]  Would you be surprised that it's liberals and Democrats that are filled with hate here?
[00:31:05.605 --> 00:31:14.649]  71% of Democrats would not go on a date with a Republican, compared to 31% of Republicans not wanting to go on a date with a Democrat.
[00:31:16.156 --> 00:31:19.741]  41% of Democrats would not shop at a business run by a Republican.
[00:31:19.761 --> 00:31:24.607]  7% of Republicans wouldn't shop at a business run by Democrats.
[00:31:24.887 --> 00:31:30.855]  37% of Democrats would not be friends with a Republican, whereas only 5% of Republicans would not be friends with the Democrats.
[00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:32.437]  Do you see who the real hate group is?
[00:31:32.457 --> 00:31:37.784]   Do you see who the real group that lives with hatred And violence in their heart is?
[00:31:38.004 --> 00:31:39.485]  It's the left, but you knew that.
[00:31:40.245 --> 00:31:46.189]  Leaked internal messages show how Twitter employees debating whether to ban Libs of TikTok.
[00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:55.875]  They don't know what to do because Libs of TikTok is not violating any of the rules, but it is showing the Democrat pedophiles.
[00:31:56.075 --> 00:32:01.759]  It is putting a spotlight on all the Democrat pedophiles getting access to your kids in schools, and so they don't like that happening.
[00:32:02.199 --> 00:32:03.080]  So what are they going to do?
[00:32:03.991 --> 00:32:09.112]  Are they just going to outright ban libs of TikTok and show that they're engaged in the censorship?
[00:32:09.152 --> 00:32:10.813]  Because see, they don't want that to happen.
[00:32:11.033 --> 00:32:16.555]  They don't want people to know they're just outright engaging in censorship, even though we already know it anyway.
[00:32:16.715 --> 00:32:17.775]  They pretend like we don't.
[00:32:18.535 --> 00:32:19.915]  So that saga will continue.
[00:32:21.216 --> 00:32:28.458]  Leaked Twitter chat shows employees saying, we successfully de-platformed Trump as they consider de-platforming libs of TikTok.
[00:32:29.448 --> 00:32:34.112]  What does every tyrannical, authoritarian, murderous regime do?
[00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:40.652]   They censor their political opposition, they arrest their political opposition, and they disarm the civilians.
[00:32:40.652 --> 00:32:41.951]  [Gun cocks]
[00:32:41.951 --> 00:32:43.951]  [Gunfire]
[00:32:43.951 --> 00:32:46.951]  [Music]
[00:32:46.951 --> 00:32:50.652]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say,
[00:32:50.652 --> 00:32:53.951]   "I don't know what's gonna happen at the end of this, but you wanna fight?"
[00:32:54.108 --> 00:32:56.209]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:32:58.195 --> 00:33:05.195]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:05.195 --> 00:33:12.195]  [MUSIC]
[00:33:12.195 --> 00:33:18.195]   Info Wars has been inundated in the last week with listeners and viewers asking where is Alex Jones?
[00:33:18.024 --> 00:33:28.136]  In fact, while I have been on a business-slash-vacation trip on the West Coast, I have had a lot of people walk up to me and say, hey, I tried to tune in yesterday and heard Owen Schroeder.
[00:33:28.176 --> 00:33:29.578]  We love Owen, but where are you?
[00:33:29.658 --> 00:33:30.499]  Why aren't you on air?
[00:33:31.399 --> 00:33:33.540]  And the answer is I never take time off.
[00:33:34.361 --> 00:33:40.864]  We also have a lot of sponsor opportunities and other things where it needs a personal touch that I've been involved in.
[00:33:40.884 --> 00:33:48.027]  And so the answer is I am taking off part time, at least for the rest of this week.
[00:33:48.127 --> 00:33:52.849]  And I'll be back in studio, Lord willing, because nothing's granted in this crazy world.
[00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:56.451]  Back in studio, fighting the globalists at point blank range.
[00:33:56.491 --> 00:34:05.074]   But I want to thank Owen Schroeder, Mike Adams, Uh, Christy Lee and of course Harrison Smith and others doing a great job holding on the fort while I've been gone.
[00:34:05.094 --> 00:34:10.636]  And I also want to thank the listeners for being so concerned and asking where is, where is Alex Jones?
[00:34:10.656 --> 00:34:12.697]  But there's, there's no grand conspiracy here.
[00:34:12.717 --> 00:34:22.681]  A lot of people have also asked why there's these huge hearings attacking you and other people going on right now with January 6th, you know, thinking maybe that I've, you know, we're headed to the hills or something.
[00:34:22.701 --> 00:34:25.542]  And again, that is not the answer.
[00:34:26.002 --> 00:34:27.343]  This has been planned for a long time.
[00:34:28.363 --> 00:34:41.109]  Separately, look, if I try to respond all day to the January 6 lies or to CNN's lies with that hit piece they aired last Sunday, I wouldn't have time to be researching all the really important news and things that are unfolding.
[00:34:41.309 --> 00:34:44.870]  They are engineering financial collapse, as you know, by design.
[00:34:44.910 --> 00:34:45.831]  We predicted it all.
[00:34:45.891 --> 00:34:47.051]  This is the Great Reset.
[00:34:47.872 --> 00:34:55.895]  They plan to use inflation to destroy our savings and get us all deeper into debt and to annihilate small businesses, something I'm going to talk about more here in just a moment.
[00:34:56.778 --> 00:35:13.418]   But it really is more important to focus on that and the fact that all over the news, mainstream and alternative, there are stories everywhere with professors and teachers and so-called clergy saying we should just Get used to pedophilia.
[00:35:13.518 --> 00:35:16.722]  We should demystify it, desensitize it.
[00:35:17.322 --> 00:35:18.944]  They use all these different types of words.
[00:35:19.685 --> 00:35:21.628]  Decriminalize it is one of the big words they use.
[00:35:22.729 --> 00:35:24.011]  And just have the public accept it.
[00:35:24.131 --> 00:35:32.719]   What an incredible moment we're living in, in the middle of 2022, that these people have come out of their pedophilic closet And are openly saying we want your kids.
[00:35:32.739 --> 00:35:33.880]  But that's what this is all about.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:40.161]  It's about raping adults and children of our psyches, of our wills, of our spirits, of our bodies.
[00:35:40.201 --> 00:35:51.643]  What do you think Pfizer and Moderna and AstraZeneca and J&J with emergency authorization gene therapy injections confirmed to cause mass death, heart attacks, blood clots is?
[00:35:52.443 --> 00:35:57.684]  It is the raping of our bodies and they're getting more lockdowns planned.
[00:35:58.951 --> 00:36:03.875]  That said, I briefly responded to the CNN special that they promoted for months and finally aired last Sunday.
[00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:05.336]  I didn't watch it that night.
[00:36:05.876 --> 00:36:09.059]  I ended up watching excerpts of it online today.
[00:36:09.079 --> 00:36:13.542]  And it is just complete lies, fabrications, and twisted information.
[00:36:14.143 --> 00:36:14.783]  None of it's true.
[00:36:15.424 --> 00:36:19.847]  There's statements in there like Alex Jones said the truth doesn't matter and we're not about truth.
[00:36:20.467 --> 00:36:22.029]  That is absolutely asinine.
[00:36:22.289 --> 00:36:24.871]  And listen, you don't need to believe me to know that's true.
[00:36:25.712 --> 00:36:35.242]  Who has a track record of actively fighting tyranny and actively predicting what is going to come in the near future and even in the long-term future?
[00:36:35.623 --> 00:36:37.645]  Who is next decade's news today?
[00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:39.387]  Who is next year's news today?
[00:36:39.787 --> 00:36:41.209]  Who is tomorrow's news today?
[00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:42.410]  It's InfoWars.
[00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:56.823]   Our bread and butter, everything we do, everything We stand for is about telling the truth and we do make mistakes and when we make them, we are very happy to own up to them because we want to be credible with the audience.
[00:36:56.863 --> 00:37:16.836]  We're not like the corporate media with all the insider leaks from Project Veritas and others exposing the fact that they're lying to the public on purpose while they surveil their competition and while they engage in mass censorship and while they coordinate with government institutions, the Democratic Party illegally to carry that out.
[00:37:17.556 --> 00:37:34.520]  And now they're setting up fact-checkers in the European Union and in Canada and in other nations, which is the model for the U.S., where these government-affiliated fact-checkers list something as a disinformation outlet and then those individuals can be arrested.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:42.705]   Politicians that they say have lied selectively or put out disinformation can be Barred from running.
[00:37:43.025 --> 00:37:45.026]  Same thing they tried with Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[00:37:45.106 --> 00:37:47.267]  So, yeah, they're not just stealing elections at the ballot box.
[00:37:47.287 --> 00:37:49.728]  They're trying to steal them by blocking what candidates can run.
[00:37:50.169 --> 00:37:56.812]  And that model is being orchestrated by the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, and even NATO that's heavily involved in it.
[00:37:56.832 --> 00:37:58.373]  So we know their blueprint of control.
[00:37:58.873 --> 00:37:59.474]  Disarm us.
[00:37:59.834 --> 00:38:00.434]  Bankrupt us.
[00:38:00.494 --> 00:38:01.435]  Take over our bodies.
[00:38:01.815 --> 00:38:03.056]  Say our children belong to them.
[00:38:04.036 --> 00:38:11.160]  Say that children can give the age of consent at age seven, so that the state can come in and basically be the parent and confuse the children.
[00:38:12.029 --> 00:38:13.810]  This is their overall plan.
[00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:25.318]  And so, of course, those of the lie, the children of the lie, those that serve the author of lies, Satan, are going to say that we're not legitimate, that we're not bona fide, that we're not real.
[00:38:25.358 --> 00:38:28.040]  Because we are real, and we are telling the truth.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.602]  We are legitimate, and the people know it.
[00:38:30.622 --> 00:38:32.683]  And that's the other good news I wanted to give you right now.
[00:38:34.164 --> 00:38:50.203]   I have traveled to multiple states On the West Coast in the last week, and I have been mobbed at grocery stores, mobbed on the streets, mobbed at restaurants, mobbed at hotels.
[00:38:50.363 --> 00:38:53.863]  I mean, mobbed where first five people run up and then 10 people.
[00:38:54.284 --> 00:39:03.209]   I've had up to 25 people snapping pictures, asking for autographs, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, all saying, We know you're right.
[00:39:03.609 --> 00:39:04.690]  We know you told the truth.
[00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:05.550]  You're a legend.
[00:39:05.850 --> 00:39:06.850]  They're not going to stop us.
[00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.211]  The fact that they attack you makes us know you're for real.
[00:39:09.231 --> 00:39:10.531]  Plus everything you said has come true.
[00:39:10.551 --> 00:39:13.411]  I mean, it is insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:13.471 --> 00:39:14.632]  And again, I'm not bragging.
[00:39:14.732 --> 00:39:15.352]  Oh, I'm famous.
[00:39:15.452 --> 00:39:15.992]  Oh, I'm cool.
[00:39:16.112 --> 00:39:16.932]  I've been through hell.
[00:39:16.992 --> 00:39:18.073]  We've been through hell together.
[00:39:18.493 --> 00:39:24.274]  But the point is I am a barometer or a gauge because most people obviously aren't well known who are patriots.
[00:39:24.314 --> 00:39:34.007]   So you don't know if somebody else is a patriot or awake when you walk past them, whether they're old, Black, white, young, straight, you know, gay, whatever.
[00:39:34.047 --> 00:39:34.647]  It doesn't matter.
[00:39:35.488 --> 00:39:45.154]  But when you are well known, when you are famous, like I am, or infamous, you get to realize and basically do on the scene focus groups and polls.
[00:39:45.294 --> 00:39:46.795]  And it is incredible.
[00:39:47.296 --> 00:39:48.496]  Now the enemy has AI.
[00:39:48.917 --> 00:39:55.801]  They're able to grab giant amounts of billions of pieces of data and crunch it and actually see that the whole world is turned against them.
[00:39:56.362 --> 00:39:59.604]  And Alex Jones is again, just one small part of that, but a focal point.
[00:40:00.604 --> 00:40:03.405]  But InfoWars is a very, very large part of that focal point.
[00:40:03.445 --> 00:40:08.746]  Now getting back to small and medium-sized businesses, the target of the Great Reset, being told they're not essential.
[00:40:09.406 --> 00:40:10.546]  I've talked a lot about this.
[00:40:11.987 --> 00:40:15.027]  We have four companies that supply our high-quality supplements.
[00:40:15.747 --> 00:40:20.368]  And the biggest one we've used for 10 years, they got bought a year and a half ago during the pandemic.
[00:40:21.549 --> 00:40:27.430]  Because obviously most companies couldn't get their supplies anymore, they couldn't pay employees, they had to basically lay people off or shut down or reorganize.
[00:40:28.183 --> 00:40:35.147]  And then we wondered why the new owners, for eight months, held onto our money for four of our top products, like DNA 4s, and weren't giving them to us.
[00:40:36.108 --> 00:40:37.989]  Well, our contract said we had to pay half up front.
[00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:39.690]  We finally said, okay, we're taking our money back.
[00:40:39.730 --> 00:40:41.131]  You didn't, you know, make the product.
[00:40:41.151 --> 00:40:43.733]  And they said, no, you're going to wait till we make it.
[00:40:43.753 --> 00:40:45.254]  You're going to give us all the money up front now.
[00:40:45.274 --> 00:40:46.274]  You know, the contract doesn't say it.
[00:40:46.294 --> 00:40:48.556]  And then we're not going to do business with you after this.
[00:40:49.336 --> 00:41:05.782]   Well, we did some legal actions and things and got our raw materials and our products and now have a new top lab, even better, Producing it thank God, but but just imagine what's happening to other companies other individuals and then understand politically They're not just censoring.
[00:41:05.802 --> 00:41:08.703]  They're not just surveilling at the business level.
[00:41:09.204 --> 00:41:30.136]   It's not just this company It's been a bunch of companies that we used to use for other things that got bought out and Then said sorry we're not doing business with you anymore like power reviews, that's just the latest example, so I Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Global Social Credit Score, where if you don't play ball with the New World Order, they come in and attack you at every level.
[00:41:30.156 --> 00:41:35.759]  But the good news is, humanity's waking up and saying, no, I need to sell our products at close to full price.
[00:41:38.848 --> 00:41:41.530]  Also, move the products we do have out of the warehouse.
[00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:44.332]  And so, this is a great deal.
[00:41:44.352 --> 00:41:48.615]  The best deal you're going to find anywhere on high-quality immune support at up to 60% off.
[00:41:49.036 --> 00:41:53.639]  But this sale will only last four, five, six days because the products will sell out.
[00:41:53.919 --> 00:41:54.860]  So there's two new sales.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:00.064]  The Ultimate Immune Support, 60% off of the Immune Support System that we have.
[00:42:00.124 --> 00:42:03.226]  It's a bunch of concentrated known herbs that boost your immune system in amazing ways.
[00:42:03.467 --> 00:42:05.508]  The SuperChargent, you get that 60% off.
[00:42:05.548 --> 00:42:05.989]  With X2, 60% off.
[00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:13.188]  D3 gummies 60% off and the Whole Food multivitamin 60% off.
[00:42:13.188 --> 00:42:17.949]   So that's the ultimate immune support, 60% off when you get all four of those products together.
[00:42:17.949 --> 00:42:19.949]  Everybody should be taking this, I know I am.
[00:42:19.949 --> 00:42:23.789]  Then there's the trifecta immune support at 50% off.
[00:42:23.789 --> 00:42:28.989]   The immune support, the X2 and the D3 gummies, all three of those together, 50% off.
[00:42:28.989 --> 00:42:32.070]   And then a limited supply of X2, so good for your immune system.
[00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.750]   The missing link with most people is clean iodine in their body.
[00:42:34.750 --> 00:42:39.750]  It is 40% off back in stock at infowarsstore.com.
[00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:43.028]   And again, without your purchase, we cannot fund this operation.
[00:42:43.028 --> 00:42:48.989]   Also get Dinesh D'Souza's "2,000 Mules" on DVD at infowarsstore.com so it's in your library.
[00:42:48.989 --> 00:42:52.068]  We also have the new "COVID Land Part Three, The Shot"
[00:42:52.068 --> 00:42:54.668]  that's so important to educate yourself and others.
[00:42:54.668 --> 00:42:59.389]   You can also get combo deals and other specials where you can get the films for up to half off
[00:42:59.389 --> 00:43:05.429]   when you get films like "In Game" with it, all at infowarsstore.com or call toll free,
[00:43:05.429 --> 00:43:08.269]  888-253-3139.
[00:43:08.269 --> 00:43:11.789]   The globals are trying to shut us down, but we are in this together and we are winning.
[00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:13.590]  And I wanna salute you all and thank you all.
[00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.269]  Back to the live broadcast.
[00:43:15.269 --> 00:43:20.909]   Ladies and gentlemen, press secretary, Corrine Jean-Pierre has been the unmitigated disaster
[00:43:20.909 --> 00:43:22.849]  that we expected her to be.
[00:43:23.459 --> 00:43:31.104]  But when you hire somebody based off their skin color or sexual preference, well, we shouldn't be so surprised when they turn out to be complete morons.
[00:43:31.665 --> 00:43:34.387]  So we've got some just golden clips here.
[00:43:35.407 --> 00:43:37.429]  But what an embarrassment of a press secretary.
[00:43:38.089 --> 00:43:39.690]  Here's Karine Jean-Pierre.
[00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.392]  I mean, folks.
[00:43:42.566 --> 00:43:44.047]  No context needed for this.
[00:43:44.067 --> 00:43:45.727]  I mean, this is a self-own.
[00:43:46.247 --> 00:43:53.550]  Listen to how Korean Jean-Pierre tries to justify what's been going on economically under Joe Biden in clip seven.
[00:43:54.791 --> 00:44:02.293]  He has made this his top economic priority as we're talking about inflation, as we're talking about the economy.
[00:44:02.353 --> 00:44:08.576]  Like, we have to remember where this country was more than a year ago when he walked into office.
[00:44:08.616 --> 00:44:11.537]  The economy was not in a great place.
[00:44:11.857 --> 00:44:12.677]  Schools were closed.
[00:44:12.717 --> 00:44:13.558]  Businesses were closed.
[00:44:13.598 --> 00:44:17.339]  We didn't have a comprehensive COVID strategy.
[00:44:17.739 --> 00:44:21.800]  And what he ended up doing was meet that moment, pass the American Rescue Plan.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.121]  Only Democrats passed that plan.
[00:44:25.161 --> 00:44:25.801]  He signed it.
[00:44:25.821 --> 00:44:26.622]  It was his plan.
[00:44:26.982 --> 00:44:30.003]  And now we're seeing an economy that's bouncing back.
[00:44:31.763 --> 00:44:33.484]  Should I even bother responding to that?
[00:44:34.024 --> 00:44:36.105]  Oh, we remember where the economy was at under Trump.
[00:44:36.165 --> 00:44:36.865]  Oh, we remember.
[00:44:37.984 --> 00:44:41.567]  Pretty much booming economy, unlike we've seen in decades.
[00:44:42.528 --> 00:44:43.229]  On all metrics.
[00:44:43.969 --> 00:44:45.891]  And she says, oh, we have to remember where the economy was.
[00:44:45.951 --> 00:44:46.692]  Oh, we remember!
[00:44:46.992 --> 00:44:50.595]  Two dollars a gallon gas, cheap energy, booming economy.
[00:44:50.615 --> 00:44:51.456]  Yeah, we remember.
[00:44:52.517 --> 00:45:03.087]  But about that American Rescue Plan that she's bragging about so much, see how that held water here in clip six when Peter Doocy was asking about it.
[00:45:04.537 --> 00:45:09.278]  We are coming out of the strongest job market in American history, and that matters.
[00:45:09.378 --> 00:45:14.840]  And a lot of that is thanks to the American Rescue Plan, which only Democrats voted for that.
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.040]  Republicans did not.
[00:45:16.361 --> 00:45:22.862]  And it led to this historic economic boom that we're seeing with jobs.
[00:45:22.882 --> 00:45:27.584]  Didn't it also lead to historic inflation?
[00:45:27.644 --> 00:45:27.864]  No.
[00:45:28.744 --> 00:45:31.085]  That is not how we're seeing the American Rescue Plan.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.903]  Where are these historic economic booms?
[00:45:36.904 --> 00:45:39.005]  The prices are booming, that's for sure.
[00:45:39.145 --> 00:45:40.386]  Booming right through the roof.
[00:45:41.027 --> 00:45:43.649]  Gas per gallon has more than doubled under Biden.
[00:45:44.049 --> 00:45:47.291]  Your energy costs to heat or cool your home are up more than 25%.
[00:45:47.712 --> 00:45:50.414]  Your grocery bill, you've probably noticed, has almost doubled now.
[00:45:50.814 --> 00:45:53.096]  Where is this historic economic boom?
[00:45:53.676 --> 00:45:56.418]  This mythical historic economic boom she's talking about.
[00:45:56.478 --> 00:45:57.479]  I can't find it anywhere.
[00:45:57.539 --> 00:45:58.460]  Nobody can, but she's...
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.381]  She's still bragging about it, isn't she?
[00:46:00.661 --> 00:46:04.122]  And all Peter Doocy had to say was, oh, you mean record high inflation?
[00:46:04.403 --> 00:46:07.564]  I mean, I'm not talking about that.
[00:46:08.324 --> 00:46:09.625]  Yeah, that's definitely happening.
[00:46:10.325 --> 00:46:11.846]  So again, I mean, this woman is such a joke.
[00:46:12.686 --> 00:46:15.127]  She says, we have to remember where the economy was at under Trump.
[00:46:15.727 --> 00:46:16.468]  Oh, we remember.
[00:46:17.028 --> 00:46:22.090]  We remember 401ks through the roof, stocks through the roof, crypto through the roof.
[00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:23.071]  People had savings.
[00:46:23.111 --> 00:46:26.532]  People were buying assets, buying property, making more money than they ever made.
[00:46:27.152 --> 00:46:28.153]  And then Biden happened.
[00:46:29.568 --> 00:46:32.992]  And then inflation, and then CPI, and then PPI.
[00:46:34.674 --> 00:46:36.877]  And she says that's a booming economy?
[00:46:36.897 --> 00:46:37.598]  That's incredible.
[00:46:37.979 --> 00:46:46.529]  But if you want to see how truly pathetic the press secretary is, and I've been telling you this is the case, this is the strongest evidence proving it right now.
[00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:48.031]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:48.837 --> 00:46:53.062]  Karine Jean-Pierre literally cannot answer questions.
[00:46:53.662 --> 00:47:02.893]  She has a notebook in front of her with every answer pre-staged, pre-prepared for her to read off of note cards.
[00:47:03.373 --> 00:47:07.838]  And if the answer isn't in her note cards, it goes something like this in clip 5.
[00:47:08.976 --> 00:47:12.740]  Yeah, let me see if I have anything new for you on that.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.482]  I think it's been a couple of days since we have asked that question.
[00:47:15.342 --> 00:47:18.622]  Yeah, let me see if I have anything new for you on that.
[00:47:18.622 --> 00:47:25.742]   I think it's been a couple of days since we have asked that question.
[00:47:25.742 --> 00:47:36.742]  Okay, I don't have anything new.
[00:47:36.837 --> 00:47:38.858]  I know we made some announcements last week.
[00:47:39.339 --> 00:47:40.979]  I just don't have them in front of me.
[00:47:41.259 --> 00:47:47.622]  But if you want to come back and we'll talk through the things that we have been able to do in the past.
[00:47:48.202 --> 00:47:59.347]  They give me pre-prepared answers for all the questions that you're supposed to ask and I don't have that one in front of me and I don't have my pre-prepared response here in my notebook so I can't answer it.
[00:47:59.387 --> 00:47:59.827]  Sorry.
[00:48:00.067 --> 00:48:04.629]  I only read off this little notebook that I have here and I can't actually have a real conversation.
[00:48:04.909 --> 00:48:05.950]  But I'm black and gay.
[00:48:05.970 --> 00:48:10.133]  You know, I am very black and very gay, so, you know, I'm up here, I'm doing it.
[00:48:10.693 --> 00:48:22.722]  Well, on this Tuesday, June 14th, 2022, Roger Stone joins us live on the air and we're celebrating Donald J. Trump's birthday.
[00:48:23.262 --> 00:48:27.365]  Roger Stone, how old is the greatest president in my lifetime?
[00:48:29.203 --> 00:48:30.365]  That's an excellent question.
[00:48:30.425 --> 00:48:37.291]  I haven't looked at Wikipedia this morning, but I did call the president this morning to wish him a happy birthday.
[00:48:38.191 --> 00:48:44.817]  And I want to make it clear, I still think, on balance, he turns out to be the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln.
[00:48:45.758 --> 00:48:48.240]  Does that mean we agree with everything he did?
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:48.700]  No.
[00:48:49.281 --> 00:48:53.985]  Does that mean that he wasn't misled and betrayed by some of the people around him?
[00:48:54.245 --> 00:48:54.385]  No.
[00:48:55.416 --> 00:48:58.399]  He did always put America first.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:03.283]  I think the president's instincts have been extraordinarily solid.
[00:49:04.144 --> 00:49:09.309]  He built the most vibrant, robust economy in American history.
[00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:15.155]  I'm not sure what that woman at the White House was talking about, but let's go through that if we may.
[00:49:16.195 --> 00:49:19.276]  The Dow down 876.5 points, a 30,000 drop from the Dow under Donald Trump.
[00:49:19.096 --> 00:49:25.934]   point five points, a 30,000 drop from the Dow under Donald Trump.
[00:49:25.934 --> 00:49:32.416]  The S&P 500 down 21% since January 3rd.
[00:49:32.416 --> 00:49:39.735]   Bitcoin, in which many of our supporters have invested, down 3,100.
[00:49:39.385 --> 00:49:44.385]  $195, a 14% drop in value, the lowest value since 2020.
[00:49:44.385 --> 00:49:57.564]   Mortgage rates, a 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 5.23% up from 2.96 under the last year
[00:49:57.564 --> 00:50:04.685]  of the Trump administration, a 15 year high.
[00:50:04.685 --> 00:50:05.825]  Gas prices.
[00:50:06.275 --> 00:50:07.595]  Where are the gas prices $5?
[00:50:07.975 --> 00:50:11.796]  Because certainly not in South Florida, that's for sure.
[00:50:12.196 --> 00:50:18.657]  You're paying six and a half bucks for a gallon of gas, and if you want high test, it's now hit $7.
[00:50:19.698 --> 00:50:28.999]  Driving from here to Ocala, Florida, to meet Mike Lindell for a terrific rally by Rock the Red on Saturday, $100 to fill my gas tank.
[00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.321]  Yes, Joe, you did that.
[00:50:35.122 --> 00:50:39.785]  Inflation at 8.6%, the highest since 1981.
[00:50:40.985 --> 00:50:48.130]  So, Owen, where is the economic recovery, the boom Biden economy that this woman is talking about?
[00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:52.192]  Because I'm not seeing it, and I don't think the American people are seeing it.
[00:50:52.677 --> 00:50:53.597]  Well, it's pretty incredible.
[00:50:53.637 --> 00:50:55.518]  She gets to go up there and just lie.
[00:50:55.638 --> 00:50:57.658]  I mean, that's all it is, is she's just lying.
[00:50:58.079 --> 00:51:02.200]  And the only person in the press room that's not a Democrat activist is Peter Doocy.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:06.481]  And he's barely even able to get a question in or a word in edgewise.
[00:51:06.821 --> 00:51:15.384]  But yeah, I mean, it's amazing that the press secretary sits up there saying it's the most historic boom the economy has ever had, the American economy has ever had.
[00:51:16.244 --> 00:51:21.127]  As the American citizen is scratching his head saying, wait a second, where is that going on?
[00:51:21.728 --> 00:51:23.149]  How am I missing out on that?
[00:51:23.249 --> 00:51:24.190]  I'm getting crushed.
[00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:25.731]  I'm having to dip into my savings.
[00:51:25.931 --> 00:51:27.592]  I'm having to dump my stock portfolio.
[00:51:27.812 --> 00:51:29.954]  I'm looking at my retirement and my 401k.
[00:51:29.994 --> 00:51:30.914]  It's almost gone.
[00:51:31.234 --> 00:51:33.576]  Where is this booming economy she's talking about?
[00:51:34.156 --> 00:51:36.358]  It's got to be insulting for Americans, Roger.
[00:51:36.378 --> 00:51:38.539]  I mean, that is just insulting for her to say that.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:43.443]  Well, Owen, did you ever think that you would miss Jen Psaki?
[00:51:44.605 --> 00:51:48.858]  I mean, at least she was able to lie in a much more fluid way.
[00:51:49.962 --> 00:51:53.165]  And of course we miss her endless circling back.
[00:51:53.645 --> 00:51:56.288]  This woman is literally just a dunce.
[00:51:56.808 --> 00:51:59.010]  No, that's not a racist comment.
[00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:03.914]  It has nothing to do with her race or her skin color or her sexual orientation.
[00:52:04.334 --> 00:52:05.455]  She's just stupid.
[00:52:06.156 --> 00:52:08.337]  I'd call her stupid if she were a white male.
[00:52:09.899 --> 00:52:10.920]  It's embarrassing.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:14.903]  But then this entire administration is embarrassing.
[00:52:15.824 --> 00:52:18.446]  Terrific stories repeatedly on the Gateway Pundit.
[00:52:19.006 --> 00:52:23.028]  Joe doesn't know where he is or what day of the week it is.
[00:52:23.689 --> 00:52:35.755]  Anyone who really believes that he's running the country, that he's in charge, or that his number two is in charge, really is unrealistic about how things work in Washington these days.
[00:52:36.638 --> 00:52:45.142]  Well, people should take note, when you hire somebody based off the color of their skin and their sexual preferences, you're probably going to end up hiring a moron.
[00:52:45.582 --> 00:52:50.605]  And I'd say that Jean Pierre is probably the dumbest press secretary in U.S.
[00:52:50.645 --> 00:52:50.905]  history.
[00:52:50.945 --> 00:52:52.565]  At least, I can't think of one, Roger.
[00:52:52.605 --> 00:53:04.649]   I can't think of a press secretary that I've witnessed that is as moronic As Jean-Pierre, perhaps not the biggest liar, but they all max out on lying, so she just fits the bill there.
[00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:11.091]  But, uh, boy oh boy, what an embarrassment to sit there and tell the American people it's the most historic, booming U.S.
[00:53:11.151 --> 00:53:19.172]  economy ever, as most people are suffering, the middle class is shrinking, food processing plants being burned to the ground, grocery bills doubling, and everything else.
[00:53:19.212 --> 00:53:31.006]   I mean, it's just, it's insulting for the people, Roger, but, you know, I think the Democrats know that what they're doing is so destructive for their own
[00:53:31.006 --> 00:53:35.546]   party that they're kind of starting to kind of bite their tongue a little bit.
[00:53:35.546 --> 00:53:40.006]  They know maybe that they should lose big time in the midterms.
[00:53:40.006 --> 00:53:43.825]   I've got an interesting clip I want to play for you later where the Democrats saying,
[00:53:43.825 --> 00:53:48.866]   basically calling for civil war if Democrats don't maintain the House and the Senate.
[00:53:48.866 --> 00:53:49.926]  I get your response to that.
[00:53:49.926 --> 00:53:53.906]   But I mean, do you think Democrats are starting to realize, huh, we really have screwed the
[00:53:53.906 --> 00:53:54.906]  pooch.
[00:53:54.906 --> 00:53:58.746]   We've destroyed this country and the people know it's us, no matter the blame games we
[00:53:58.746 --> 00:54:02.545]  play on Putin or Russia.
[00:54:02.544 --> 00:54:05.526]  Look, I think their strategy is one of distraction.
[00:54:05.926 --> 00:54:10.369]  First, there is, of course, the epic January 6th charade.
[00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:14.312]  They've now postponed the next set of hearings until Thursday.
[00:54:14.332 --> 00:54:16.433]  I guess the ratings weren't too good.
[00:54:16.854 --> 00:54:20.596]  They've hired the ABC News producer, James Goldstein.
[00:54:20.836 --> 00:54:21.777]  You may remember him.
[00:54:21.837 --> 00:54:26.700]  He's the guy who spiked the Jeffrey Epstein story at ABC.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:30.983]  He's producing this made-for-television extravaganza.
[00:54:31.804 --> 00:54:42.234]  So they're hoping that that will distract people from gas prices, from food shortages, from epic inflation, from the fact that we are shipping $40 billion.
[00:54:42.674 --> 00:54:44.696]  And by the way, that's just a down payment.
[00:54:45.016 --> 00:54:48.400]  There's another $60 billion in the pipeline to Ukraine.
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:54.303]  So we can't spend $5.7 million to seal our own border.
[00:54:54.683 --> 00:55:01.327]  We've come to a point in America where fentanyl is more readily available and plentiful than baby formula.
[00:55:01.687 --> 00:55:02.948]  Thank you, Joe Biden.
[00:55:04.366 --> 00:55:08.587]  Yeah, that's just one story that really kind of gives you the full picture.
[00:55:08.627 --> 00:55:13.768]  By the way, the situation in Ukraine is, there's some interesting developments there, Roger.
[00:55:14.908 --> 00:55:16.989]  Ukraine's losing badly, first of all.
[00:55:17.409 --> 00:55:19.249]  They keep saying Ukraine's winning.
[00:55:19.909 --> 00:55:21.029]  Again, that's like saying the U.S.
[00:55:21.049 --> 00:55:21.930]  has a booming economy.
[00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:24.570]  This is in the Washington Post, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:29.811]  The headline is, Ukraine is running out of ammunition as prospects dim on the battlefield.
[00:55:30.631 --> 00:55:33.212]  And then in the story, I'm reading directly here.
[00:55:34.679 --> 00:55:46.341]  Russia is firing as many as 50,000 artillery rounds a day into Ukrainian positions, and the Ukrainians can only hit back with around 5,000 to 6,000 rounds a day, he said.
[00:55:46.821 --> 00:55:50.222]  How is that possible with all the funding that the U.S.
[00:55:50.362 --> 00:55:54.263]  has given to Ukraine, at least $40 billion, that they only have 5,000 rounds a day?
[00:55:54.603 --> 00:55:56.043]  Something doesn't add up there, folks.
[00:55:56.343 --> 00:55:59.264]  And then this one was even more weird to me.
[00:56:00.399 --> 00:56:13.497]  Ukraine has now almost completely run out of ammunition for the Soviet-era weapons systems that were the mainstay of its arsenal, and the Eastern European countries that maintain the same systems have run out of surplus supplies to donate.
[00:56:14.648 --> 00:56:25.373]  Ukraine urgently needs to shift to longer-range and more sophisticated Western systems, but those have only recently been committed and in insufficient quantities to match Russia's immense power.
[00:56:26.033 --> 00:56:33.436]  So, they're using, like, 50-year-old weapons, is what they're claiming, that Ukraine is using 50-year-old weapons.
[00:56:33.696 --> 00:56:35.157]  How is that even going on?
[00:56:35.797 --> 00:56:38.079]  And then apparently they don't have enough, even though the U.S.
[00:56:38.119 --> 00:56:43.624]  has sent tens of billions of dollars over there, and as Rand Paul said over a month ago, I mean, how is this going on?
[00:56:43.804 --> 00:56:47.222]   is an amendment to be included in the final bill that allows for the inspector
[00:56:47.222 --> 00:56:49.804]  general to oversee how funds are spent.
[00:56:49.804 --> 00:56:54.242]   Anyone who is opposed to this is irresponsible. All the Democrats oppose it.
[00:56:54.242 --> 00:56:58.322]   How is this going on? Have you ever seen a more... To me this is just the most
[00:56:58.322 --> 00:57:03.363]   blatant money laundering, money theft operation
[00:57:03.363 --> 00:57:06.764]   of the hundreds and even thousands that happened via our government.
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.481]  This is like the most obvious, Roger.
[00:57:09.922 --> 00:57:10.883]  A tiny correction.
[00:57:11.083 --> 00:57:16.887]  All the Republicans and all the Democrats opposed any effort to trace where the money was going.
[00:57:17.408 --> 00:57:24.157]   So Senator Rand Paul, perhaps A handful of patriots in the Senate simply wants to know, where's the money going?
[00:57:24.698 --> 00:57:28.100]  And on a bipartisan basis, that is voted down.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.682]  I think it tells you everything you need to know.
[00:57:31.002 --> 00:57:39.087]  But the Russians must be winning because I'm reading in the New York Post that the Ukrainians are kicking the crap out of them.
[00:57:39.148 --> 00:57:40.428]  I read it every day.
[00:57:40.769 --> 00:57:46.713]  This is the worst war propaganda since William Randolph Hearst and the Spanish-American War.
[00:57:47.233 --> 00:57:48.294]  That's Roger Stone.
[00:57:48.334 --> 00:57:50.036]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:50.056 --> 00:57:52.538]  We'll be right back after this break.
[00:57:52.938 --> 00:57:53.419]  76, Roger!
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:58.203]  76 is how old President Donald Trump is today.
[00:57:59.044 --> 00:58:06.471]  And boy oh boy, I mean, just the comparison of Donald Trump's cognition next to Joe Biden's, who I believe is 77 a year older.
[00:58:07.192 --> 00:58:10.835]  Biden is like at a score of 0 to 100.
[00:58:10.914 --> 00:58:13.474]  Biden's cognition is about a nine.
[00:58:13.474 --> 00:58:16.394]  Trump's is about an 89, if not higher.
[00:58:16.394 --> 00:58:19.554]  And the juxtaposition of that is just incredible.
[00:58:19.554 --> 00:58:22.795]   But Roger, I wanna kind of finish up, we were just discussing Ukraine.
[00:58:22.795 --> 00:58:26.673]   I wanna just finish this up real quick because I've got some other headlines here.
[00:58:26.673 --> 00:58:29.195]  It's amazing, like you said, the war propaganda.
[00:58:29.195 --> 00:58:35.235]   Ukraine says troops holding out in Sibirian Donsk after last bridge destroyed.
[00:58:35.084 --> 00:58:38.126]  I may have butchered that city there, but again, it's another story.
[00:58:38.206 --> 00:58:39.827]  Ukraine, they can't do anything.
[00:58:39.867 --> 00:58:40.748]  They don't know what to do.
[00:58:41.128 --> 00:58:42.569]  They're losing the bridges.
[00:58:42.609 --> 00:58:43.931]  They're losing the routes.
[00:58:44.251 --> 00:58:49.275]  In fact, the original headline here in the Reuters story was, Russian forces cut off last route.
[00:58:49.895 --> 00:58:58.460]  Outside of Eastern Ukraine, so it's more proof Russia is winning, but now Zelensky says he vows to retake Donbass and Crimea.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.101]  Well, how is he gonna do that?
[00:59:00.821 --> 00:59:02.162]  Just exactly.
[00:59:02.622 --> 00:59:04.083]  I guess he's hoping the U.S.
[00:59:04.103 --> 00:59:08.365]  finally intervenes in a larger war, but the Mexican president, he sees what's going on.
[00:59:08.886 --> 00:59:16.428]   Mexico president slams immoral NATO proxy war in Ukraine, and that's really what it is, Roger.
[00:59:16.428 --> 00:59:19.468]  So I mean, just what do you make of all this war propaganda?
[00:59:19.468 --> 00:59:20.668]  What sense do you make of it?
[00:59:20.668 --> 00:59:25.309]   And I mean, in your opinion, is this something that America should really be that concerned about?
[00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:31.308]   Look, I think you have to go back to the origins and the entire purpose of this war.
[00:59:31.308 --> 00:59:40.029]   And when you say this, like Tucker Carlson has, like Alex Jones has, as I have,
[00:59:40.029 --> 00:59:46.828]   you have to be expected to be slammed as a Russian stooge, as one of Putin's puppets.
[00:59:47.031 --> 00:59:48.753]  But the facts are very clear.
[00:59:49.471 --> 00:59:56.415]  Putin has said for well over two years that he objected to Ukraine joining NATO.
[00:59:57.055 --> 01:00:09.603]  We know for an absolute fact that in 1994 we signed an agreement with Boris Yeltsin and the Soviets in which we agreed not to bring Ukraine into the NATO orbit.
[01:00:09.983 --> 01:00:11.484]  Let me translate that for you.
[01:00:12.228 --> 01:00:21.270]  What Putin is saying is he does not want offensive missiles pointed at Russia, sighted, sitted in Ukraine.
[01:00:21.711 --> 01:00:27.912]  The silos, interesting enough, Max Blumenthal, the left-wing but anti-war journalist, reported this.
[01:00:28.292 --> 01:00:31.953]  The silos for these missiles have already been built at NATO.
[01:00:32.033 --> 01:00:33.934]  That means US expense.
[01:00:34.434 --> 01:00:37.835]  So he's made it very clear that he's acting defensively.
[01:00:38.405 --> 01:00:39.846]  Yesterday, the U.S.
[01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:51.876]  Department of Defense finally released a document that proves that there are as many as 25 bioweapons labs operating under taxpayer funding.
[01:00:51.896 --> 01:00:56.600]  Yeah, actually, the document said 46, Roger, the official document of the Defense Department.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:57.640]  46 biolabs.
[01:00:57.761 --> 01:00:59.222]  Oh, I thought it was Russian propaganda.
[01:00:59.282 --> 01:01:01.864]  No, it was real.
[01:01:02.024 --> 01:01:02.905]  I stand corrected.
[01:01:03.125 --> 01:01:06.007]  Hey, you scratch my back, you correct me, I correct you.
[01:01:06.047 --> 01:01:06.948]  We're in this together, brother.
[01:01:07.962 --> 01:01:09.924]  Well, that is entirely true.
[01:01:10.004 --> 01:01:29.726]   The point I guess I'm making is that this entire notion That Putin wants to insert a puppet government in Ukraine to restore the faded glory of the once great Soviet Union is economically unfeasible and it's just incorrect.
[01:01:30.126 --> 01:01:49.660]   He is acting defensively and no matter what you read in the US press, right now the Ukrainian puppet state propped up by the United States The money laundering and child sex trafficking capital of the world, they're losing and they are losing badly.
[01:01:50.701 --> 01:02:00.227]  President Zelensky has an amazing $3.6 million luxury beach condominium just down the road here in Miami Beach.
[01:02:00.247 --> 01:02:01.868]  I wonder how he got that.
[01:02:01.888 --> 01:02:04.470]  I mean, the guy is an actor, you have to admit.
[01:02:05.057 --> 01:02:07.639]  The casting has been very well, done very well.
[01:02:07.719 --> 01:02:12.101]  I mean, he does play the role of a president extraordinarily well.
[01:02:12.682 --> 01:02:14.503]  Nobody thinks he is running anything.
[01:02:15.263 --> 01:02:34.495]  And the desire to cover up the epic corruption of the money laundering that has happened in Ukraine over the last two decades, under the Bushes, under the Clintons, under the Obidins, under the Obamas most certainly, is a major, major impetus behind this war.
[01:02:35.357 --> 01:02:39.280]  Even the Pope is saying NATO and the West has provoked Russia into this war.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:45.725]  And I want to get back to domestic issues, but just one more thing with your vast political experience here.
[01:02:46.645 --> 01:02:50.548]  Iran and Venezuela signed a 20-year agreement, will confront the U.S.
[01:02:50.568 --> 01:02:50.968]  together.
[01:02:51.429 --> 01:03:05.800]   So, I mean, I've been talking about this for a while, and I don't see many other people talking about this, Roger, how since Biden got into office and his foreign policy, basically Whatever strength the U.S.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:09.541]  had on the international stage and whatever relations the U.S.
[01:03:09.561 --> 01:03:15.284]  had that kind of added to that strength, it's all dissipating quickly, Roger.
[01:03:15.324 --> 01:03:16.564]  I mean, like overnight.
[01:03:16.605 --> 01:03:19.186]  I mean, people don't understand how the U.S.
[01:03:19.226 --> 01:03:23.366]   has lost it's seat at the table on the world stage, how we've been
[01:03:23.366 --> 01:03:24.985]  knocked down the totem pole so much.
[01:03:24.985 --> 01:03:29.385]   I mean, Russia and China are now coming together in kind of an anti-US stance.
[01:03:29.385 --> 01:03:34.346]   India looks like they're kind of more friendly with that alliance than even the US.
[01:03:34.346 --> 01:03:40.586]   Mexico, Brazil seem to be siding with Russia on the Ukrainian front as well.
[01:03:40.586 --> 01:03:46.586]   So, I mean, all these different global power structures are kind of turning their back to the US, kind of giving US
[01:03:46.586 --> 01:03:46.666]  the...
[01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:49.950]  the cold shoulder, kind of saying, you know what, we don't really want to deal with you anymore.
[01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:52.051]  I think the same thing is happening in Saudi Arabia.
[01:03:52.071 --> 01:03:53.431]  I don't think they want to meet with Biden.
[01:03:53.651 --> 01:03:54.251]  He's a joke.
[01:03:54.291 --> 01:03:55.872]  Why would you even waste your time?
[01:03:56.492 --> 01:04:02.134]  Roger, what is your take on all of this development right now on the world stage?
[01:04:02.394 --> 01:04:05.755]  Because it pretty much is going unreported by the media, but I mean, the U.S.
[01:04:05.815 --> 01:04:08.136]  is quickly going down the totem pole and fast.
[01:04:09.693 --> 01:04:25.576]  Well, I think this was probably Donald Trump's greatest single accomplishment, which is he rebuilt our military, and then he created the clear impression around the world that he was not unwilling to project American power.
[01:04:26.276 --> 01:04:32.480]  When he cut off the Iranian arms deal, which all of his advisors told him he could not actually do.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.022]  In other words, Mr. President, that was great campaign rhetoric.
[01:04:36.502 --> 01:04:41.825]  I understand it made for great applause lines during the 2016 campaign, but you can't really do it.
[01:04:42.806 --> 01:04:43.566]  And he did it.
[01:04:44.306 --> 01:04:54.012]  It signaled, I think, to all of our allies and our adversaries an unpredictability about Trump that put them at a disadvantage.
[01:04:54.815 --> 01:05:10.052]  Biden's initial move to remove sanctions on the Iranians and to essentially restart the Iranian arms deal was a signal to everyone around the world that he would not step up in any arena.
[01:05:10.492 --> 01:05:15.258]  So the Iranians begin raining missiles on Israel.
[01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:21.012]  The Russians mass on the Ukrainian border at that time.
[01:05:21.732 --> 01:05:27.874]  The Chinese start harassing American flagged ships in the South China Sea.
[01:05:28.354 --> 01:05:33.076]  The North Koreans restart their nuclear weapons development program.
[01:05:33.736 --> 01:05:37.599]  That's because Joe Biden exudes weakness.
[01:05:38.179 --> 01:05:45.784]  Lack of resolve is abundantly clear to the Chinese, for example, that should they move on Taiwan.
[01:05:46.508 --> 01:05:49.490]  Joe Biden will do absolutely nothing.
[01:05:49.971 --> 01:05:55.735]  I mean, he might sponsor a strong resolution in the UN, should probably get voted down at this point.
[01:05:56.395 --> 01:06:04.981]  But he will take no action whatsoever to defend our allies in the mainland, pardon me, on Taiwan.
[01:06:05.422 --> 01:06:08.244]  So this is the manifestation of weakness.
[01:06:09.307 --> 01:06:20.650]  The greatest single attribute of the Trump administration was the concept that starts under Dwight Eisenhower, is particularly true under Ronald Reagan, and is revived by Donald Trump.
[01:06:21.050 --> 01:06:22.531]  Peace through strength.
[01:06:22.991 --> 01:06:27.892]  That strength is a deterrent to mischief around the globe.
[01:06:28.032 --> 01:06:28.833]  That's Roger Stone.
[01:06:28.853 --> 01:06:29.393]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:29.413 --> 01:06:30.053]  We've got to take a break.
[01:06:30.273 --> 01:06:32.535]  And we've got Roger Stone with us.
[01:06:32.975 --> 01:06:48.109]  Quick programming note, Alex Jones is going to be back with us in the next segment, and then Roger Stone is going to be hosting the third hour today, giving you his best analysis and breakdown.
[01:06:48.429 --> 01:06:50.872]  And so I look forward to that as well.
[01:06:52.153 --> 01:06:55.356]  Roger, I want to play this clip for you and get your response to it.
[01:06:56.266 --> 01:07:03.909]  Here is a Democrat representative on MSNBC threatening civil war if Democrats don't maintain Congress here in clip 20.
[01:07:04.289 --> 01:07:06.249]  Should the GOP retake Congress in the fall?
[01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:09.831]  What happens to the January 6th committee investigation and its findings?
[01:07:10.131 --> 01:07:13.912]  And what might the GOP do or not do with their newly claimed power?
[01:07:16.098 --> 01:07:19.941]  So the January 6 Commission would cease to exist.
[01:07:20.741 --> 01:07:30.328]  The findings will be completely suppressed and will not be admitted into any further investigations while the GOP will be in power.
[01:07:30.989 --> 01:07:42.277]  They would impeach President Biden as quickly as possible, and they will continue to find ways to impeach him going forward.
[01:07:42.677 --> 01:07:57.992]  It would also embolden Republicans and the far right and white nationalists across the country to begin to believe that it is their time to not just take power in the House, but the Senate, the White House, and state houses across the country.
[01:07:58.312 --> 01:08:10.485]   And we got to understand that this is a group that has been radicalized by the Great Replacement myth and many other things, and have been pushing For violence and pushing for even civil war.
[01:08:11.025 --> 01:08:14.349]  So that is what's at stake right now in terms of this election.
[01:08:15.618 --> 01:08:17.279]  Okay, Roger, so let me get this straight.
[01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:20.941]  Democrats are currently engaged in terrorism at pregnancy centers.
[01:08:20.961 --> 01:08:23.322]  They've firebombed more than ten of them in the last month.
[01:08:23.622 --> 01:08:29.925]  Democrats are currently engaged in terrorism when it comes to Supreme Court justices, threatening their lives, attempting to kill them.
[01:08:30.306 --> 01:08:32.006]  Democrats are literally running around D.C.
[01:08:32.046 --> 01:08:34.428]  right now with a group called Shut Down D.C.
[01:08:34.708 --> 01:08:38.770]  with what they call jail liaisons, because they're planning on committing crimes.
[01:08:39.010 --> 01:08:42.412]  So they have lawyers and bail bondsmen running around with them.
[01:08:43.292 --> 01:08:47.453]  In case they may get arrested by their friends in the police force in D.C.
[01:08:47.953 --> 01:08:54.535]  Oh, but Roger, oh, it's Trump supporters, it's conservatives that are the problem if we win an election.
[01:08:54.555 --> 01:08:57.636]  I mean, this is just, it's such a load of bull.
[01:08:57.856 --> 01:08:59.696]  And then he says, oh, the Great Replacement Theory.
[01:08:59.896 --> 01:09:00.976]  Oh, Roger, I'm sorry.
[01:09:01.076 --> 01:09:05.417]  I didn't just watch a video of 20,000 illegal immigrants coming across our border.
[01:09:05.637 --> 01:09:08.458]  I didn't just see 3 million illegal immigrants come across the border in 2021.
[01:09:08.598 --> 01:09:11.699]  I mean, I must be seeing things, Roger.
[01:09:13.638 --> 01:09:17.639]  Well, as usual, Jamal has everything exactly backwards.
[01:09:18.679 --> 01:09:24.720]  So yes, if the Republicans win the House, there probably will be impeachment proceedings against Joe Biden.
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:30.101]  His dereliction of duty on our southern border certainly grounds for impeachment.
[01:09:30.542 --> 01:09:41.924]  There's more than enough evidence in Hunter Biden's laptop, 10% for the big guy, far more evidence that was ever used in the two phony impeachments of Donald Trump.
[01:09:42.484 --> 01:10:00.373]  By the way, by your standard, Jamal, your claim of civil war, you should be referred to the Justice Department for prosecution because you're essentially saying that words are responsible for the actions of a handful on January 6th.
[01:10:00.773 --> 01:10:02.534]  I understand that you hate the First Amendment.
[01:10:03.364 --> 01:10:05.366]  I understand you see everything backwards.
[01:10:05.726 --> 01:10:07.167]  No, we do have replacements.
[01:10:07.187 --> 01:10:08.028]  It's not a theory.
[01:10:08.188 --> 01:10:09.529]  It's not a conspiracy theory.
[01:10:09.549 --> 01:10:11.230]  The raw numbers are there.
[01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:30.303]  What the Republican control of Congress might do would be to empower not white supremacists, a tiny group, but your friends in Antifa and Black Lives Matter who burned down half the country, killed people, destroyed public and private property, injured thousands.
[01:10:30.999 --> 01:10:32.900]  Jamal Bowman is a clown.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:33.821]  He's a buffoon.
[01:10:34.541 --> 01:10:35.402]  He's a jerk-off.
[01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:41.605]  The fact that he sees everything asked backwards is right out of the Alinsky book.
[01:10:41.885 --> 01:10:43.026]  But we've marked it down now.
[01:10:43.066 --> 01:10:44.747]  You called for civil war.
[01:10:45.087 --> 01:10:51.831]  If Republicans won the House, you should be referred to the Justice Department for prosecution under your standard.
[01:10:52.796 --> 01:11:04.005]  But of course, I guess because Democrats, part of their makeup, part of their fabric is terrorism, I guess that's why they never have to answer to all their terroristic threats and crimes, because that's part of their makeup.
[01:11:04.045 --> 01:11:12.952]  Whereas the Republicans are Christians and conservatives that love this country, so, you know, somebody steps sideways in D.C., they have to be sent to jail for a year.
[01:11:14.013 --> 01:11:15.874]  Well, look, there should be one standard.
[01:11:16.675 --> 01:11:22.019]  Essentially, the January 6th committee hearings so far have produced no beef.
[01:11:22.637 --> 01:11:28.764]  What they're trying to say is that Trump's public comments, which are constitutionally protected free speech.
[01:11:29.205 --> 01:11:37.053]  By the way, it's interesting the way CNN always edits out what he says, peacefully and patriotically march to the Capitol.
[01:11:37.153 --> 01:11:40.457]  Notice how they just truncate that to march to the Capitol.
[01:11:40.918 --> 01:11:41.759]  Not even clever.
[01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:54.563]  But if that's true, then Vice President Kamala Harris must be prosecuted for her responsibility in the BLM Antifa riots two summers ago.
[01:11:54.943 --> 01:12:04.306]  By that standard, she is responsible for those riots because she exercised her First Amendment rights to support the burning down of half of America.
[01:12:04.967 --> 01:12:07.688]   One standard One standard of justice.
[01:12:08.088 --> 01:12:09.168]  But we haven't seen that.
[01:12:09.288 --> 01:12:30.778]  So, if you're Hillary Clinton, if you're General James Clapper, if you're Islamic convert and former CIA director John Brennan, if you're Rod Rosenstein, if you're James Comey, the FBI director, Andrew McCabe, his deputy, you can lie to Congress with impunity.
[01:12:31.358 --> 01:12:38.282]  Regarding material matters that actually hide underlying crimes, and you will not be prosecuted.
[01:12:38.782 --> 01:12:57.871]   But if you make mistakes of omission that are immaterial, irrelevant, and hide no underlying crime, as I did, well, you'll be not only railroaded in a Soviet-style show trial, But you'll also, they'll attempt to give you seven to nine years in prison.
[01:12:58.231 --> 01:13:22.245]   If you're like Owen Schroer, in which you just happen to be standing in the wrong place where you have destroyed no property, assaulted no one, trespassed nowhere, broke, hurt no one at all, just standing in the wrong place, A place that was secretly a special zone where you couldn't stand, you'll be prosecuted for a crime, even though you're a journalist and you're covering the event.
[01:13:22.686 --> 01:13:29.672]  But if you're a CNN cameraman, or if you're John Sullivan of Antifa, you won't be harassed at all.
[01:13:30.112 --> 01:13:38.520]  So we, again, the double standard, as they said, if it weren't for double standards, liberals would have no standards whatsoever.
[01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:47.774]  Roger, I think we have a bit of an insight here into maybe where the Trump administration went a little sideways as we changed lanes.
[01:13:48.254 --> 01:14:00.528]   Leaked texts between Sean Hannity and Kayleigh McEnany come out during the J6 hearing, and it's Sean Hannity basically telling McEnany No more crazy people, which to me means it's the elitist.
[01:14:00.788 --> 01:14:06.395]  Hey, no more people that aren't New York elitist or DC elitist getting Trump's ear, getting Trump's influence.
[01:14:06.955 --> 01:14:09.398]  And he then goes on to say, no more stolen election talk.
[01:14:09.538 --> 01:14:11.281]  OK, so let the Democrats steal the elections.
[01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:16.307]  He says he wants Hunter to be pardoned.
[01:14:17.538 --> 01:14:18.559]  And so some other stuff here.
[01:14:18.579 --> 01:14:21.983]  I mean, Roger, shed some light on this, if you can.
[01:14:22.504 --> 01:14:25.807]  And then the weird testimony from Jason Miller.
[01:14:25.827 --> 01:14:26.929]  He's wearing a mask.
[01:14:26.949 --> 01:14:28.330]  He says Giuliani was drunk.
[01:14:28.611 --> 01:14:30.092]  I mean, to me, this is D.C.
[01:14:30.152 --> 01:14:30.853]  elitism.
[01:14:31.213 --> 01:14:32.094]  This is our proof.
[01:14:32.175 --> 01:14:32.555]  D.C.
[01:14:32.615 --> 01:14:37.821]  elitists were trying to influence Trump, keep him away from the people, and Hannity must have been one of them.
[01:14:39.486 --> 01:14:40.807]  Let me take those backwards.
[01:14:41.067 --> 01:15:05.395]  So in 1988, when the election, pardon me, in 2000, when the election result was in doubt, James A. Baker III, former Secretary of State, then running the recount operation for George W. Bush, urged Bush, despite the fact that the returns were inconclusive, to claim a victory.
[01:15:05.996 --> 01:15:09.418]  He was hailed in the legacy media as a strategic genius.
[01:15:10.078 --> 01:15:19.863]  Now, when Rudy Giuliani gives the exact same advice to Donald Trump, well, Jason Miller says that Giuliani was drunk.
[01:15:20.404 --> 01:15:23.185]  No, I think it was good political advice then.
[01:15:23.625 --> 01:15:25.566]  It's good political advice now.
[01:15:26.507 --> 01:15:32.590]  Possession is nine-tenths of the law, particularly in the fight over public perception.
[01:15:33.192 --> 01:15:44.819]  So, Jason Miller, as you know, works for Getter, funded by the Chinese, and he is clearly not a reliable ally of the President.
[01:15:45.179 --> 01:15:47.921]  By the way, he did testify against the- We gotta go to break, Roger.
[01:15:47.941 --> 01:15:48.581]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:49.742 --> 01:16:01.429]  Thanks to your backing, InfoWars is recognized by the enemies of the people as the number one source of resistance to their New World Order takeover that we are now, now deep into.
[01:16:02.581 --> 01:16:12.268]  So again, I want to just commend all the listeners for the work you've done, the tireless fighting you've engaged in, the ridicule, the attacks, the scorn, the demonization, the persecution.
[01:16:12.488 --> 01:16:14.489]  And I want to just salute you again for what you've done.
[01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:27.098]  It is a great honor to have the most deceitful known liars on the planet, CNN, put together a collection of disinformation, lies, and fraud.
[01:16:27.930 --> 01:16:30.352]  And then package it and spew it against InfoWars.
[01:16:31.213 --> 01:16:40.559]  And to have their affiliate organizations, like Yahoo and countless other publications, you name it, come out and regurgitate the lies.
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:55.771]  The idea that we are an empire, that InfoWars is an empire, that we're the establishment, and that we don't care about truth, and that we're all these horrible, terrible things, is just preposterous.
[01:16:56.947 --> 01:17:04.533]  And I don't have time and I'm not going to bore people because I don't hardly anybody watches CNN with the disinformation they put out Sunday.
[01:17:05.093 --> 01:17:09.957]  But I went ahead and watched the whole thing yesterday and only watched pieces of it previously.
[01:17:09.977 --> 01:17:16.102]  And it was just all regurgitated lies and just total gaslighting.
[01:17:16.142 --> 01:17:22.733]   Like Alex talks about freedom, but he was He was out there with protesters telling them not to wear a mask.
[01:17:23.273 --> 01:17:26.435]  I mean, what in the world do they think they're doing?
[01:17:26.995 --> 01:17:38.102]  They've convinced themselves because they've got zombie banking from AT&T and the establishment that they can just stay on air forever.
[01:17:38.202 --> 01:17:44.726]  And even though they have basically no listeners, it doesn't matter that their propaganda will override and silence the American people.
[01:17:45.547 --> 01:17:58.429]  But I'll say this, for some of the former employees that haven't worked in Infowars in years and years and years, who have made it their new job, their new profession.
[01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:10.261]  Uh, to go around the establishment media corridors and the state run media and spew things that they know aren't true, that I forgive them and I feel sorry for them.
[01:18:11.382 --> 01:18:17.708]  And I understand that when Trump got in, a lot of people got pressured by their families and got intimidated and got threatened.
[01:18:18.909 --> 01:18:23.512]  Uh, and that they were convinced that anybody associated with Trump would be destroyed forever.
[01:18:24.133 --> 01:18:26.594]  And certainly that's what the globals have tried to do.
[01:18:26.614 --> 01:18:34.721]  And so they made decisions to basically defect, uh, or become Benedict Arnold's, uh, and join the establishment.
[01:18:34.781 --> 01:18:37.863]  And all I can say is America is going to win.
[01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:38.944]  Humanity is going to win.
[01:18:39.004 --> 01:18:40.825]  People are waking up, not just here, but worldwide.
[01:18:40.845 --> 01:18:44.248]  Uh, and you've chosen the wrong side of history, but I forgive you.
[01:18:45.049 --> 01:18:47.651]  And I just thank God every day that.
[01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:56.788]  I don't come from the type of people that produce individuals that would do the type of things that they've done.
[01:18:57.728 --> 01:19:03.711]  And they have to live for the rest of their lives with who they are, and what they've done, and the things they've said, and the things they've done.
[01:19:04.331 --> 01:19:08.613]  Because they know that almost everything they said is not true.
[01:19:09.736 --> 01:19:14.699]  And that the only kernels in there are basically things they took and twisted.
[01:19:14.719 --> 01:19:23.645]  I can give so many examples, but it's all based on the John Ronson NPR disinfo piece that was 95% lies and the rest twisted disinformation.
[01:19:23.665 --> 01:19:31.290]  There was also a New York Times article that one of them supposedly wrote a few years ago that's the same blueprint.
[01:19:31.870 --> 01:19:37.374]  And folks, there never was a goldfish period at the office on my children.
[01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:40.431]  May I be struck down by 10,000 bolts of lightning?
[01:19:41.011 --> 01:19:42.492]  There was never a goldfish.
[01:19:43.392 --> 01:19:50.777]  And I didn't grab a goldfish out of a goldfish bowl and eat it because the employee wasn't doing their job.
[01:19:51.337 --> 01:19:52.538]  That's the wolf of Wall Street.
[01:19:53.299 --> 01:19:59.443]  And you know, that's what's sick about the New York Times and CNN is they just throw it in your face.
[01:19:59.603 --> 01:20:01.224]  It's like Biden.
[01:20:02.621 --> 01:20:10.204]  Uh, running around right now saying he doesn't want to hear about inflation and the economy because they're doing great things for people.
[01:20:10.624 --> 01:20:11.785]  What the hell does that mean?
[01:20:11.805 --> 01:20:14.606]  We're saying it's Russian disinformation.
[01:20:15.606 --> 01:20:17.647]  We're saying that it's Putin's gas hike.
[01:20:17.827 --> 01:20:24.350]  We all know it's him shutting down the pipelines and the drilling permits and on and on and on and the, and the, and the overprinting by the fellow reserve.
[01:20:25.150 --> 01:20:26.731]  And in fairness, Trump was part of that too.
[01:20:26.751 --> 01:20:28.891]  This has been going on a long time, but it accelerated under Biden.
[01:20:29.251 --> 01:20:30.392]  They printed more money.
[01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:38.145]  In the last year and a half under Biden, that had ever been printed in the history of the United States over 250 years, look it up.
[01:20:39.606 --> 01:20:46.071]  So yeah, Trump pressed on the accelerator, but at least we're trying to bring jobs back to the US and make the dollar dominant.
[01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:48.593]  And I still had some criticism of it.
[01:20:49.674 --> 01:20:54.398]  I'm not a Trump cult, but what Biden's done is just jam the accelerator down through the floorboard.
[01:20:54.418 --> 01:20:55.559]  And the idea that.
[01:20:58.832 --> 01:21:01.614]  That it's disinformation or Russian disinfo to say that.
[01:21:01.674 --> 01:21:03.395]  I mean, these people fall on a banana peel.
[01:21:04.436 --> 01:21:05.077]  It's the Russians.
[01:21:06.157 --> 01:21:08.119]  So, I'm really worried about this country and the world.
[01:21:08.159 --> 01:21:08.939]  I'm worried about my children.
[01:21:08.959 --> 01:21:09.960]  I'm worried about everybody's future.
[01:21:11.021 --> 01:21:26.592]  And, you know, I told one of these individuals whenever they were defecting over to CNN and the establishment years ago, I said, listen, you know, you're going, you're writing this piece, you've called me, you've told me you're writing it, you want me to be interviewed for it, I'm not going to be interviewed for it.
[01:21:27.461 --> 01:21:30.743]  But I said, mark my words, you'll be a creature of these people now for the rest of your life.
[01:21:31.784 --> 01:21:34.806]  You'll now be in the system, and you're going to find out how horrible they are.
[01:21:35.506 --> 01:21:40.089]  I mean, these are the folks that pushed the untested poison shot on people.
[01:21:40.109 --> 01:21:42.010]  These are the people that are pushing the collapsed borders.
[01:21:42.711 --> 01:21:48.815]  These are the people pushing all the fake WMD lies, and the wars, and the airport scanners, and just all of it.
[01:21:49.655 --> 01:21:52.517]  That's another crazy part about the piece in CNN.
[01:21:52.597 --> 01:21:56.700]  And again, it's regurgitated disinfo from the Ronson stories.
[01:21:57.768 --> 01:22:01.591]  That there wasn't radiation from Fukushima and Fukushima wasn't a big deal.
[01:22:02.211 --> 01:22:13.680]  And it wasn't in the San Francisco Chronicle and West Coast newspapers that they had up to five times elevated radiation and fish being caught off of San Francisco and areas off Anchorage, Alaska.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:19.584]  And that we didn't send people out there with Geiger counters and it didn't show three to five times the normal level.
[01:22:19.865 --> 01:22:21.646]  That's exactly what the local newspaper said.
[01:22:22.654 --> 01:22:28.436]  And then, and then, and then I'm bad because we sell iodine that's good for your thyroid?
[01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:34.437]  When you can turn on national news and they're selling iodine and they're precious.
[01:22:34.477 --> 01:22:36.138]  Zelinsky says people should be taking it.
[01:22:36.438 --> 01:22:38.678]  I mean, God, Zelinsky says take it.
[01:22:38.918 --> 01:22:44.460]  So if God says it, you see, but the idea is, Oh my God, he sells water filters.
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:46.240]  He tells you there's bad stuff in the water.
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:47.041]  He tells you water filters.
[01:22:47.581 --> 01:22:51.246]   It's like, if I, Owned an outfitters before somebody's about to go in the
[01:22:51.246 --> 01:22:54.305]   wilderness to pan for gold 150 years ago, and I said you better buy
[01:22:54.305 --> 01:23:00.845]   Some waterproof jackets real freeze to death out there in the rain like look he's selling waterproof jackets
[01:23:00.845 --> 01:23:05.784]   Well, what kind of profiteer is that I mean I mean you do need a waterproof jacket when you're on the wilderness
[01:23:05.784 --> 01:23:09.186]   But you know you need a gun too, but still why is he selling guns?
[01:23:09.186 --> 01:23:14.565]   You know it's just totally insane how they operate as if they're not the establishment
[01:23:14.886 --> 01:23:18.485]   as if they're not owned by the arms manufacturers and big tech that's
[01:23:18.485 --> 01:23:21.765]  censoring and surveilling everybody.
[01:23:19.876 --> 01:23:28.903]  It's just sad to see people think that they can run into the skirts of the establishment, under the black wings of the new world order, and that they're going to be winners and successful.
[01:23:29.384 --> 01:23:30.204]  It's just so sad.
[01:23:30.224 --> 01:23:34.068]  But hey, the world's waking up, America's waking up, and humanity's winning.
[01:23:34.668 --> 01:23:39.292]  And I commend and salute our listeners and supporters for all you've done and the fact you're giving us more support than ever.
[01:23:39.772 --> 01:23:44.864]   And as I said earlier, Everywhere I go, we're just getting massive, unprecedented support.
[01:23:46.284 --> 01:23:48.625]  Just the outpouring of love is incredible.
[01:23:49.245 --> 01:23:53.746]  I'd say we're getting five times the response on the street, positive response we've ever gotten.
[01:23:54.587 --> 01:23:59.368]  And so it really, really shows that in the beginning, a patriot's a scarce man, hated, feared, scorned.
[01:23:59.768 --> 01:24:03.569]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the timid join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:08.791]  Look, I got a lot of negative stuff when Trump first got in, and I got a lot of attacks, but it was still 10 to 1.
[01:24:10.223 --> 01:24:13.624]  Now the negative stuff is 100 to 1.
[01:24:14.144 --> 01:24:17.506]  Positive is 100 to 1 negative.
[01:24:17.526 --> 01:24:17.946]  100 to 1.
[01:24:18.106 --> 01:24:19.186]  I mean more like 500 to 1.
[01:24:19.226 --> 01:24:21.607]  I don't even really get negative comments anymore.
[01:24:21.967 --> 01:24:25.168]  A guy on the airport the other day said, uh, scumbag when he walked past me.
[01:24:25.768 --> 01:24:28.169]  That's like the one thing I've heard in months.
[01:24:28.829 --> 01:24:30.170]  So you guys are losing.
[01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:32.230]  You signed on to losing operations.
[01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:33.231]  CNN has no ratings.
[01:24:33.251 --> 01:24:33.811]  They've collapsed.
[01:24:33.831 --> 01:24:34.531]  Everybody hates them.
[01:24:34.831 --> 01:24:36.352]  They are the definition of fake news.
[01:24:37.252 --> 01:24:39.252]  And that's it.
[01:24:39.252 --> 01:24:40.252]  Alright, back to the live show.
[01:24:40.252 --> 01:24:42.252]  Owen Schroeder is knocking out of the park.
[01:24:42.252 --> 01:24:43.252]  Infowars.com.
[01:24:43.252 --> 01:24:44.252]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:24:44.252 --> 01:24:46.252]  The globalists are so upset that we have our own operation.
[01:24:46.252 --> 01:24:50.252]   They're so upset that we're self-funded through you, that you back us and not soar us.
[01:24:50.252 --> 01:24:54.252]   They're so upset that we have freedom and real independence that you give us by backing us.
[01:24:54.252 --> 01:24:56.252]  So again, please visit Infowarsstore.com.
[01:24:56.252 --> 01:25:02.252]   We have a bunch of big specials that are running right now that are so incredibly important.
[01:25:02.555 --> 01:25:11.262]  We have the ultimate immune support package with four of the best compounds known to boost your body's natural immunity.
[01:25:11.682 --> 01:25:18.646]   We have the immune support, the gummy bears, the multivitamin, The Whole Foods multivitamin and of course X2 back in stock.
[01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:21.525]  All of those together, unprecedented, 60% off.
[01:25:21.525 --> 01:25:24.525]   But there's only a few thousand in one of them, so it's going to be only a few days
[01:25:24.525 --> 01:25:25.525]  that's able to run.
[01:25:25.525 --> 01:25:35.605]   Then we have the Trafecta, the immune support, the X2 and the D3 gummies for 50% off.
[01:25:35.605 --> 01:25:37.645]  And then again, X2 back in stock, limited supply.
[01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:50.454]  It's 40% off by itself, all at InfoWarsTore.com, and it enrages and angers the media that we raise money, and that we fight their lawsuits, that we stay on air in defiance to them, and it's you backing us, and it's you keeping us on air.
[01:25:50.474 --> 01:25:57.621]  So again, I salute you, and I thank you, and I ask you to visit InfoWarsTore.com and get great products that boost your immune system, make your life healthier and better.
[01:25:58.021 --> 01:26:04.445]  And stick it to the New World Order that are just absolutely fuming that the American people and others have come together to keep liberty and freedom on the air.
[01:26:04.525 --> 01:26:05.525]  You are incredible.
[01:26:05.946 --> 01:26:13.810]  InfoWarStore.com InfoWarStore.com Go there now and stand up to CNN and the dying zombie dinosaur media.
[01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:21.618]   InfoWarStore.com All right, this is my final five minutes with Roger Stone, and he's going to be hosting the rest of the way.
[01:26:21.658 --> 01:26:27.305]  But Roger, I just wanted to finish this up with you here, because we got cut off by the break a couple segments ago.
[01:26:27.325 --> 01:26:37.036]   To me, when I see this text from Sean Hannity, It just screams DC elitism, New York elitism, political elitism.
[01:26:37.456 --> 01:26:39.258]  They don't want Trump connected to the people.
[01:26:39.298 --> 01:26:46.385]  They don't want the people with access to Trump's ear, Trump's soul, Trump's heart, which is what endeared him so much to his supporters and his voters.
[01:26:46.966 --> 01:26:49.669]  And of course, Hannity was anti-Trump until he got into office.
[01:26:50.169 --> 01:26:53.614]  I mean, I just feel like so much of the problem with D.C.
[01:26:53.674 --> 01:26:54.575]  politics and U.S.
[01:26:54.615 --> 01:26:56.077]  politics exists right here.
[01:26:56.378 --> 01:27:04.749]  There's an elite class, they know what their stake is, they know what their hold is, they know their control, and they don't like it to be relinquished, even Sean Hannity.
[01:27:06.505 --> 01:27:09.606]  Well, first of all, Sean Hannity is a friend of mine.
[01:27:10.467 --> 01:27:19.830]  On the other hand, this is a graphic example of why Tucker Carlson's ratings at Fox have zoomed ahead of Sean Hannity's.
[01:27:20.290 --> 01:27:23.892]  Sean is traditionally a neocon Republican.
[01:27:24.872 --> 01:27:31.415]  To his credit, and with great gratitude, I would tell you that he prayed for justice in my case.
[01:27:31.795 --> 01:27:37.057]  And therefore, I'm not going to criticize him in an unduly harsh way.
[01:27:37.957 --> 01:27:44.600]  But I do think, as he's told me himself, he doesn't even go to the bathroom without his lawyer.
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:53.723]  And he recognizes that those who stand up to the new world order, oh, I don't know, say Alex Jones, for example.
[01:27:54.222 --> 01:27:55.863]  Or Owen Schroyer?
[01:27:56.323 --> 01:27:58.383]  Or maybe even Roger Stone?
[01:27:59.163 --> 01:28:00.104]  You get targeted.
[01:28:00.524 --> 01:28:04.105]  You get targeted by a politicized Justice Department.
[01:28:04.585 --> 01:28:07.926]  They don't want to just defeat us politically.
[01:28:08.106 --> 01:28:11.727]  They don't want to defeat us in an election or in a public debate.
[01:28:12.227 --> 01:28:13.487]  They want to destroy us.
[01:28:13.587 --> 01:28:16.508]  They want to incarcerate us and destroy us.
[01:28:16.568 --> 01:28:18.569]  They can't win a debate.
[01:28:19.049 --> 01:28:23.190]  They can't win a free, fair exchange of ideas.
[01:28:23.770 --> 01:28:33.917]  So, I find none of this shocking in the sense that Sean would seek to mollify the establishment.
[01:28:34.457 --> 01:28:49.927]  Also, by the way, in keeping with the new management style of Fox, I mean, Fox during the day, if you see their program, is every bit as debased and left-wing and misleading as CNN.
[01:28:50.934 --> 01:28:56.559]  If it weren't for Tucker Carlson, there'd be no reason to go to Fox whatsoever.
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:04.045]  And real conservatives are limited in their access in terms of being guests.
[01:29:04.486 --> 01:29:17.117]  So if you're not an establishment Republican, other than the programming of Tucker Carlson, where I believe he gets to choose his own guests, you're not appearing on Fox.
[01:29:17.697 --> 01:29:31.672]  What's particularly interesting, Owen, is as I look at Republican primary voter data in the primaries in May and June and the upcoming primaries in July and August, Fox is losing ground every single day.
[01:29:32.347 --> 01:29:36.648]  The number of patriots watching Fox drops by the week.
[01:29:37.168 --> 01:29:39.169]  Many of them are coming here to InfoWars.
[01:29:39.729 --> 01:29:49.511]  Others are going to Newsmax or OAN or FrankSpeech.com or other more diffuse locations.
[01:29:50.312 --> 01:29:59.734]  But Sean Hannity, as you remember, some of his most celebrated broadcasts were when he interviewed President George W. Bush.
[01:30:00.274 --> 01:30:03.477]  So, he is not an America First conservative.
[01:30:03.917 --> 01:30:07.080]  He is a more traditional neocon conservative.
[01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:12.104]  Witness the way he has beat the drum for the war in Ukraine.
[01:30:13.337 --> 01:30:20.162]  Roger Stone, ladies and gentlemen, always entertaining, informative, and of course a great friend of mine, Roger.
[01:30:21.003 --> 01:30:23.684]  You're going to be taking over here hosting the rest of the way.
[01:30:23.744 --> 01:30:30.830]  I know you have very important topics and a litany, a range of topics as well, including the latest CNN hit piece of Alex Jones.
[01:30:30.870 --> 01:30:33.972]  I don't think it was a coincidence that they finally released it.
[01:30:34.012 --> 01:30:35.533]  They've been sitting on it for a while now.
[01:30:35.893 --> 01:30:39.976]  I don't think it's a coincidence this timing, but you'll be talking about that coming up.
[01:30:40.016 --> 01:30:42.237]   So ladies and gentlemen, the next Welcome back.
[01:30:42.078 --> 01:30:47.078]  Alex Jones Show, it's Roger Stone and then Wayne Allen Root.
[01:30:47.078 --> 01:30:48.638]  So stick around, don't go anywhere.
[01:30:48.638 --> 01:30:51.638]  And folks, remember to shop at Infowarsstore.com as usual.
[01:30:51.638 --> 01:30:53.437]  You know, sales are down when Alex is out.
[01:30:53.437 --> 01:30:56.478]   That gets him a little worried considering the attacks we're under.
[01:30:56.478 --> 01:31:01.117]   So go to Infowarsstore.com, get yourself a tube of the Super Coral Whitening Toothpaste
[01:31:01.117 --> 01:31:02.398]  and all the other great supplements.
[01:31:02.398 --> 01:31:05.117]  Roger Stone takes over on the other side.
[01:31:05.117 --> 01:31:07.018]  Welcome back.
[01:31:07.018 --> 01:31:12.018]  I'm Roger Stone and this is the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:12.619 --> 01:31:18.665]  I'm so delighted to be back in the saddle here, substituting for my friend Alex Jones.
[01:31:19.165 --> 01:31:23.369]  And off the bat, I want to salute my colleague, Owen Schroyer.
[01:31:23.850 --> 01:31:35.699]   As many of you know, for almost two years, Owen Schroyer and I co-hosted The War Room, Which shows from four o'clock central, five o'clock eastern.
[01:31:36.319 --> 01:31:37.620]  I think I have that right.
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:44.704]  But it is must-watching for anyone who understands the info war in which we are engaged.
[01:31:45.184 --> 01:31:58.972]  And as for my good friend Owen Schreier, we pray for justice in the outrageous prosecution of him, where I believe he's being prosecuted essentially for standing in the wrong place.
[01:31:59.472 --> 01:32:01.954]  At the wrong time on January 6th.
[01:32:02.815 --> 01:32:13.102]  He is single-handedly pioneering the James A. Garfield look with that beard and he has never been better than he was on the air today.
[01:32:14.426 --> 01:32:20.469]  Today is the 76th birthday of President Donald J. Trump.
[01:32:21.249 --> 01:32:33.714]  Without any question, Donald Trump in 2016 upsets the apple cart for the two-party duopoly that had been running for president.
[01:32:34.286 --> 01:32:38.509]  You see, the 2016 election was a settled matter.
[01:32:38.929 --> 01:32:58.483]  It was going to be Hillary Clinton versus former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and the globalist, one-world, one-government policies of the two-party duopoly were going to move forward without any interruption.
[01:32:59.384 --> 01:33:06.107]  Along comes the most improbable political candidate in American political history.
[01:33:06.827 --> 01:33:15.091]  Not since 1940 has either major party actually nominated a businessman for president.
[01:33:16.031 --> 01:33:26.976]  And of course, the mainstream media builds Donald Trump up in the pre-nomination phase, particularly Fox News, I might add.
[01:33:27.771 --> 01:33:35.437]  On the false assumption that Trump would be the easiest Republican for Hillary Clinton to defeat.
[01:33:36.398 --> 01:33:39.801]  In truth, the exact opposite turns out to be true.
[01:33:40.281 --> 01:34:02.357]   In other words, based on my 40 years in American politics, I don't believe any of the other Republican candidates, be they Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina, any of these candidates would have stood any chance against the vaunted Clinton machine.
[01:34:03.318 --> 01:34:06.360]  What is it that is Trump's great strength?
[01:34:07.041 --> 01:34:09.923]  By the way, we don't defend everything that he did.
[01:34:10.224 --> 01:34:12.826]  We don't agree with everything that he did.
[01:34:13.436 --> 01:34:18.039]  But on balance, he essentially puts America first.
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:25.324]  Rebuilds our economy to give us the most robust economy in American history.
[01:34:25.905 --> 01:34:29.567]  The greatest rate of job creation in our history.
[01:34:30.048 --> 01:34:35.151]  The greatest rate of wage increases in our history.
[01:34:35.591 --> 01:34:41.836]  He appoints scores of conservatives to the judiciary at all federal levels.
[01:34:43.179 --> 01:34:51.365]  He restores respect and more importantly fear for America around the world regarding our adversaries.
[01:34:52.105 --> 01:35:04.854]  But he also, much as Nixon going to China, is the only president who is able to engage the North Koreans who have on their way to nuclear weapons in a dialogue.
[01:35:05.634 --> 01:35:09.837]  When Barack Obama left office, he told Donald Trump two things.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:14.323]  One, your greatest single danger is the North Koreans.
[01:35:15.383 --> 01:35:19.827]  Advice echoed, by the way, by Bill Clinton to Joe Biden.
[01:35:20.667 --> 01:35:26.851]  The other thing he told him was, whatever you do, don't appoint General Michael Flynn to any office.
[01:35:27.572 --> 01:35:37.399]  Well, Donald Trump actually was able to open the door to the North Koreans because he believes that talking is always better than a nuclear war.
[01:35:38.466 --> 01:35:47.530]  Now, of course, under Joe Biden, the North Koreans have restarted their nuclear weapons development program.
[01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:55.273]  The question I get the most, of course, is, is Trump going to run again in 2024?
[01:35:55.493 --> 01:36:03.036]  The answer to your question is, based on my own conversations with him, I think he would like to.
[01:36:03.056 --> 01:36:05.417]  I think he is inclined to.
[01:36:06.141 --> 01:36:10.345]  I also think that he has not yet made a decision.
[01:36:10.925 --> 01:36:25.577]  There was a story in yesterday's UK Daily Mail which said that the President plans a Florida-based announcement of his 2024 candidacy this summer.
[01:36:26.378 --> 01:36:33.884]  And that the purpose in doing so is to steal a march on Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.
[01:36:34.699 --> 01:36:43.643]  Checking out this story on my own, I think that is not necessarily inaccurate, but I do think it is premature.
[01:36:44.303 --> 01:36:49.786]  I do not see President Trump making a decision about the 2024 elections prior to the 2022 elections.
[01:36:50.326 --> 01:36:54.725]  prior to the 2022 elections.
[01:36:54.725 --> 01:37:00.605]   After all, if you don't find out whether the 2022 elections are fair,
[01:37:00.605 --> 01:37:08.126]   free, transparent, and honest, why would you risk all in yet another election?
[01:37:08.126 --> 01:37:18.126]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:37:09.152 --> 01:37:14.294]  Ron DeSantis is running for president no matter what he tells you today.
[01:37:14.314 --> 01:37:19.956]  He has amassed a hundred million dollars in his state campaign fund.
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:25.884]  He has amassed another $90 million in a federal campaign fund.
[01:37:26.805 --> 01:37:29.827]  He has been a good governor of Florida.
[01:37:30.327 --> 01:37:34.450]  I will most definitely vote for his reelection as governor.
[01:37:35.151 --> 01:37:48.060]  I particularly like the way he has taken on the culture war, where he has fought those who would foist gender, race, or sexual lies upon our children.
[01:37:48.829 --> 01:37:53.032]  But in many cases, I wish that his rhetoric would match his record.
[01:37:53.092 --> 01:38:02.720]  So, for example, when Governor DeSantis says, uh, when they send illegal immigrants here to Florida, I'm going to send them back to Delaware.
[01:38:03.581 --> 01:38:05.022]  Fabulous applause line.
[01:38:05.102 --> 01:38:06.083]  Great applause line.
[01:38:06.721 --> 01:38:11.625]  Unfortunately, he has yet to send anybody to Delaware or anyone.
[01:38:11.865 --> 01:38:12.606]  They're anywhere.
[01:38:12.646 --> 01:38:18.590]  There are over 248,000 illegals who have been resettled in the state of Florida.
[01:38:18.650 --> 01:38:24.535]  They come here by plane, they come here by bus, and none of them have been deported.
[01:38:25.195 --> 01:38:30.059]  Then there's the question of Nancy Pelosi's secret police force.
[01:38:31.094 --> 01:38:56.125]  Through an act of Congress, we know that the House and the Senate appropriated monies for a legislative-based branch of the Capitol Hill Police with a barrack somewhere between Orlando and Tampa, and that there are up to 500 Capitol Hill Police officers in the state of Florida investigating right-wing extremism.
[01:38:56.934 --> 01:39:06.841]  This is unheard of in American history, a police force that reports to Nancy Pelosi, not to the Justice Department, not to the FBI.
[01:39:07.341 --> 01:39:14.406]  So I would like to see Governor DeSantis do something about that and do it soon.
[01:39:15.006 --> 01:39:17.888]  We also have the election integrity issue.
[01:39:18.549 --> 01:39:26.054]  I believe that there are 1.6 million phantom voters on the rolls here in Florida.
[01:39:26.681 --> 01:39:28.142]  What we should do about that?
[01:39:28.202 --> 01:39:30.764]  Well, we'll talk about that on the other side.
[01:39:31.865 --> 01:39:50.201]  We are going to bring you a message now from InfoWars.com's store, because as Owen said, as Alex said in the last segment, it is absolutely vital to keep InfoWars on the air as that beacon of freedom, as that shining city on the hill.
[01:39:50.561 --> 01:39:57.568]   And now with X2 Survival Shield back in stock, And the triple immune formulas available again.
[01:39:57.988 --> 01:40:12.604]  It's more important than ever that you go to the InfoWars.com store and support the vital work being done by Alex Jones, Owen Schroer, Harrison Smith, and everyone here at InfoWars.
[01:40:13.204 --> 01:40:16.786]  This literally drives the left insane.
[01:40:17.287 --> 01:40:26.932]  The fact that we use the free enterprise system, the fact that InfoWars is self-sufficient and independent, that we depend on no one other than you.
[01:40:28.454 --> 01:40:39.942]  This drives the left nuts and it is the way to keep InfoWars doors open and to keep the investigative journalism that you see here and no one else coming.
[01:40:40.322 --> 01:40:44.705]  So here is a message from the InfoWars.com store.
[01:40:45.145 --> 01:40:45.946]  Welcome back.
[01:40:47.206 --> 01:40:52.590]  I'm Roger Stone and I'm proud to be sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:40:54.239 --> 01:41:01.204]  Several months ago, CNN began promoting a special on Alex Jones.
[01:41:02.044 --> 01:41:09.869]  They spent millions of dollars and many precious minutes on the air promoting the coming hatchet job.
[01:41:10.750 --> 01:41:11.290]  The title?
[01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:13.852]  Megaphone for Conspiracy.
[01:41:14.852 --> 01:41:21.777]  Finally, this aired at 8 o'clock Eastern Time this past Sunday night.
[01:41:23.081 --> 01:41:31.864]  In the 40 years that I've been involved in American politics, I have never seen a more audacious hatchet job.
[01:41:32.805 --> 01:41:35.986]  Let me tell you about the Alex Jones that I know.
[01:41:37.312 --> 01:41:54.984]  I didn't meet Alex Jones until the 50th anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination, when he was in Dealey Plaza, and I was also there promoting my first book, The Man Who Killed Kennedy, The Case Against LBJ.
[01:41:56.044 --> 01:42:01.628]  We met, and he invited me to be interviewed on InfoWars, which would come to pass.
[01:42:02.589 --> 01:42:06.131]  We subsequently became extraordinarily good friends.
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:11.243]  The reason I like Alex Jones is the reason I like Donald Trump.
[01:42:12.064 --> 01:42:13.385]  Because he's genuine.
[01:42:13.985 --> 01:42:15.306]  Because he's authentic.
[01:42:15.907 --> 01:42:17.328]  Because he's real.
[01:42:18.249 --> 01:42:19.069]  It's not an act.
[01:42:19.149 --> 01:42:20.410]  It's not artifice.
[01:42:20.630 --> 01:42:25.234]  He doesn't have an on-air personality and an off-air personality.
[01:42:25.814 --> 01:42:29.237]  He is a true American patriot.
[01:42:30.713 --> 01:42:38.760]  Yes, the entire way InfoWars sets up to be completely self-sufficient is ingenious.
[01:42:39.541 --> 01:42:41.882]  It's entrepreneurial genius.
[01:42:41.922 --> 01:42:47.247]  You see, Alex Jones doesn't have to worry about pressure from his advertisers.
[01:42:47.707 --> 01:42:56.034]  He doesn't have to worry about being taken off the air or censored or shut down because he owns his own servers.
[01:42:56.852 --> 01:43:06.062]  Sure, there was a time when many people watched this program through Spotify or YouTube or Hulu and other places.
[01:43:06.842 --> 01:43:31.375]   But even when there was a massive conspiracy, which on one single day, Alex Jones and the Alex Jones Show and InfoWars were deplatformed across the board, Because of the loyalty of the InfoWars audience, people quickly went to the URL, InfoWars.com, where this program can be seen every day.
[01:43:32.215 --> 01:43:38.541]  Not to mention the American Journal with Erickson Smith and the War Room with Owen Schroer.
[01:43:39.482 --> 01:43:42.765]  And this is what drives the left crazy.
[01:43:43.306 --> 01:43:45.528]  But let's get into some of the specifics.
[01:43:46.261 --> 01:43:55.086]  No, Alex Jones never punched somebody in the arm so hard that they split their arm open and there was blood everywhere.
[01:43:55.566 --> 01:43:57.287]  That never happened.
[01:43:57.908 --> 01:44:01.650]  Alex Jones never said, I'm only in this for the money.
[01:44:01.670 --> 01:44:03.911]  I have no interest in the truth.
[01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:06.152]  Alex Jones never said that.
[01:44:06.492 --> 01:44:09.054]  And that is not what he believes.
[01:44:09.954 --> 01:44:26.763]  Alex Jones, although you may disagree with his views on Sandy Hook, I do for example, I believe he has a First Amendment right to say anything he wishes regardless of how repugnant or offensive it may be to some people.
[01:44:27.244 --> 01:44:31.386]  Therefore, I believe the cases against him have been wrongly decided.
[01:44:31.806 --> 01:44:35.948]  Again, I'm not defending the substance of what he's accused of saying.
[01:44:36.469 --> 01:44:38.750]  I'm defending his right to say it.
[01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:42.191]  That's how the Constitution works.
[01:44:43.311 --> 01:44:53.092]  So, it is an outrageous takedown, but what's most obvious about this new documentary is the way it must have been quickly re-edited.
[01:44:53.593 --> 01:45:01.194]  First of all, interviewing Alex Jones' ex-wife, she's certainly an unbiased witness, wouldn't you say?
[01:45:01.534 --> 01:45:04.034]  She has no axe to grind.
[01:45:04.854 --> 01:45:07.715]  By the way, red beans and rice didn't miss her.
[01:45:08.942 --> 01:45:14.363]  I thought that was a particularly vicious part of this hatchet job.
[01:45:15.283 --> 01:45:21.265]  But what they really hate, more than anything else, is the continued existence of InfoWars.
[01:45:21.725 --> 01:45:23.245]  The fact that we are even here.
[01:45:23.785 --> 01:45:26.346]  And the fact that we are self-sufficient.
[01:45:27.306 --> 01:45:58.314]   In these times of stress, and believe me, my wife and I have known extraordinary stress, because in the period after my pardon, We have been subjected to no less than 17 baseless, fraudulent, highly sensationalized lawsuits, which are designed to both drag my name in the mud yet again, I'm already clickbait, and run up massive legal bills.
[01:45:58.875 --> 01:46:08.520]  In this time of stress, it is particularly important that you keep your immune system working at peak efficiency.
[01:46:09.272 --> 01:46:17.897]  That's why the Triple Immunity Package, now available only through WinForWars.com, is of particular value.
[01:46:18.398 --> 01:46:22.880]  First of all, you have Survival Shield X2 back in stock at 40% off.
[01:46:24.821 --> 01:46:30.428]  The Immune Support Trifecta Pack, 50% off.
[01:46:30.808 --> 01:46:43.023]  This includes Survival Shield X2, Vitamin D3 gummies with calcium, and the Immune Support Formula that includes Vitamin C, D, and Zinc.
[01:46:43.499 --> 01:46:48.282]  And then of course, there's the ultimate immune support pack at 60% off.
[01:46:48.783 --> 01:46:58.769]  Again, Survival Shield X2, the vitamin D3 gummies with calcium, the immune support formula, plus the whole food multivitamin.
[01:46:59.269 --> 01:47:05.974]  I cannot stress enough to you folks that not only do these products work, are they effective?
[01:47:06.634 --> 01:47:08.155]  We make no medical claims.
[01:47:08.335 --> 01:47:10.297]  They're just based on science.
[01:47:10.937 --> 01:47:15.899]  It is essential that you keep your immune system working at peak efficiency.
[01:47:16.299 --> 01:47:38.045]  So, with Survival Shield X2 back in stock, with the World Health Organization estimating that 50 million people will suffer from some kind of mental impairment due to iodine deficiency, I strongly recommend these very products, which have a two-fold effect.
[01:47:38.768 --> 01:47:50.067]  One, they will boost your immunity system for these stressful days ahead while America is challenged as never before, but also they will keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:47:50.771 --> 01:47:59.455]  When Alex Jones cries wolf and tells you we are under extraordinary legal and financial pressure, that's not hype, folks.
[01:47:59.936 --> 01:48:02.377]  That's not that's not fake news.
[01:48:02.797 --> 01:48:03.778]  That's the truth.
[01:48:04.418 --> 01:48:12.522]  Alex Jones, just as they targeted me, just as they are targeting Owen Schroyer, is hated by the deep state.
[01:48:13.062 --> 01:48:18.685]  And they would like nothing more than for InfoWars to be forced to pull the plug.
[01:48:19.463 --> 01:48:20.945]  Don't let it happen.
[01:48:21.045 --> 01:48:25.869]  Please go to InfoWars.com now and give us your support.
[01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:33.777]  InfoWars was a vital beacon of freedom for me when I was fighting for my life.
[01:48:34.397 --> 01:48:40.483]  And Alex Jones was one of the few reliable, loyal friends in that battle.
[01:48:41.041 --> 01:49:01.455]  Along with Tucker Carlson and a handful of others, when so many who I knew and had helped in their careers, whose shows I had been on, whose children I had gotten into private schools, who I had helped to break major stories, when all of those people turned their back on me, Alex Jones was there.
[01:49:01.875 --> 01:49:06.337]   And now folks that he is under attack, We need to be here for him.
[01:49:06.697 --> 01:49:11.238]  Please go to the InfoWars.com store now and give us your support.
[01:49:11.779 --> 01:49:16.359]  You, by the way, can go to the vitamin shop or you can go to Amazon.
[01:49:16.399 --> 01:49:27.262]  You can get other supplements that sound like the supplements that we offer at InfoWars.com, but they will cost you more and the quality will be less.
[01:49:27.962 --> 01:49:28.702]  Welcome back.
[01:49:29.811 --> 01:49:37.256]  This is Roger Stone, and I'm delighted to be back in the host chair on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:49:37.896 --> 01:49:40.858]  Alex is taking some well-deserved rest.
[01:49:41.539 --> 01:49:47.943]  Let me return to the CNN hatchet job on Alex Jones that showed on Sunday night.
[01:49:48.663 --> 01:49:58.350]  Don't be surprised if you missed it, so did most of the people who had a television set on, because if there weren't airports, well, nobody would be watching CNN.
[01:49:59.585 --> 01:50:22.438]  The idea that they would put on Oliver Darcy, a man with no credibility whatsoever, to assault Alex Jones, a man who has pretty much turned out to be right about most, but not everything, that he has predicted from the time he began in radio and locally there in Austin, well, that's a little hard to swallow.
[01:50:23.479 --> 01:50:25.220]  This was a hatchet job.
[01:50:25.841 --> 01:50:29.083]  I personally suspect checkbook journalism.
[01:50:29.203 --> 01:50:46.979]  In other words, those former InfoWars employees who came forward to disparage the work being done by Alex Jones and the hardworking people at InfoWars, I question whether they were paid for their appearances.
[01:50:47.579 --> 01:50:48.580]  I don't assert it.
[01:50:49.181 --> 01:50:50.762]  I simply question it.
[01:50:51.283 --> 01:50:56.805]  That CNN is not above paying for those to smear Jones.
[01:50:56.865 --> 01:50:58.986]  Well, that's indisputable.
[01:50:59.787 --> 01:51:00.607]  There he is now.
[01:51:01.007 --> 01:51:05.969]  There is the beady-eyed look of a criminal and a congenital liar.
[01:51:06.569 --> 01:51:07.029]  Take a look.
[01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:12.612]  So, what is the real purpose of this documentary?
[01:51:13.212 --> 01:51:17.994]  That was revealed in the final two-thirds of the documentary.
[01:51:19.018 --> 01:51:25.242]  There is no question that, like me, Alex Jones was present in Washington, D.C.
[01:51:25.842 --> 01:51:28.043]  on January 5th and 6th.
[01:51:28.864 --> 01:51:44.012]  There is no question that Alex Jones exercised his First Amendment right of free expression to question the accuracy and the authenticity of the results of the 2020 election.
[01:51:46.036 --> 01:51:57.701]  There is no question that Alex Jones, unlike me, chose to go to the President's speech at the Ellipse, marched to the Capitol, and was at the Capitol.
[01:51:58.402 --> 01:52:07.266]  But no one has found a link where Alex Jones urged anyone, directly or indirectly, to violate the law.
[01:52:08.152 --> 01:52:17.261]  In fact, Alex Jones, like me, supported a 10-day delay in the certification of the Electoral College.
[01:52:18.081 --> 01:52:29.071]  By the way, we don't argue that Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to just reject the certification of the Electoral College vote for Joe Biden.
[01:52:29.592 --> 01:52:52.650]   We simply argue that he had the constitutional right To send the decision back to individual states where quite clearly under the law the authority lies with the state legislatures to determine whether the vote in their state was honest and legitimate and to award electors on the basis of that decision.
[01:52:53.445 --> 01:53:06.074]  So the effort by some or the actions by some to breach the Capitol were completely and totally counterproductive to what we were trying to achieve.
[01:53:06.764 --> 01:53:23.673]  What we're trying to achieve is based in constitutional free speech and the constitutional right under the Fourth Amendment for Americans to gather together and express peacefully and patriotically their point of view.
[01:53:24.594 --> 01:53:33.100]  In the Alex Jones documentary, the actual bite of Donald Trump is edited to take the words peacefully and patriotically out.
[01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:44.627]  So he urges people to march to the Capitol, but not peacefully and patriotically because Oliver Darcy and his illegitimate friends edited that section out.
[01:53:45.769 --> 01:54:00.361]  If there is a subtitle for the Alex Jones special, it should be, why Alex Jones should be indicted regarding January 6th despite any evidence whatsoever that he did anything illegal.
[01:54:00.861 --> 01:54:04.004]  Look closely folks, that's the face of a psychopath.
[01:54:05.573 --> 01:54:18.643]  It is very reminiscent of a long five-page article that was done by the Washington Post, which once again proves that I wasn't at the Ellipse.
[01:54:19.283 --> 01:54:21.985]  I did not march to the Capitol.
[01:54:22.125 --> 01:54:24.287]  I was not at the Capitol.
[01:54:24.807 --> 01:54:29.651]  I did speak on January 5th to the same rally Alex Jones spoke to.
[01:54:30.152 --> 01:54:32.834]  It was a particularly effective speech by Jones.
[01:54:33.554 --> 01:54:36.776]  I think it was also a pretty effective speech that I gave.
[01:54:37.296 --> 01:54:44.819]  Unfortunately, you can't find it now since YouTube has, under their censorship policies, removed it from the internet.
[01:54:45.480 --> 01:55:08.751]   But when I said that my apocalyptic view of the choices facing America, a choice between good and evil, a choice between dark and light, a choice between the godly and the godless, And my belief that if we fail, America steps off into a thousand years of darkness.
[01:55:09.311 --> 01:55:11.894]  CNN said that was fomenting violence.
[01:55:12.654 --> 01:55:16.518]  No, that's CNN engaging in religious bigotry.
[01:55:17.741 --> 01:55:22.822]  I do believe that this is not a struggle between Republicans and Democrats.
[01:55:23.582 --> 01:55:28.644]  It's not a struggle between two alternative governing philosophies.
[01:55:29.264 --> 01:55:41.847]  The once great Democratic Party of Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy has been captured by a small group of socialists, nay communists, who are bent in destroying the U.S.
[01:55:42.187 --> 01:55:43.067]  Constitution.
[01:55:43.947 --> 01:55:55.477]  In the end, they will destroy the corporate Democrats like Nasty Pig Losey and Chuck Schumer, those who thrive and gorge on corporate campaign contributions.
[01:55:56.277 --> 01:56:05.585]  No, the AOCs of the world, the Jamal Bowens, if you will, that's the future of the Democratic Party.
[01:56:06.292 --> 01:56:10.834]  A democratic party that doesn't include any working class folks.
[01:56:11.435 --> 01:56:16.857]  That doesn't include any regular middle class people.
[01:56:17.398 --> 01:56:20.419]  A party of elites and extremists.
[01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:24.441]  Normally that would be a problem for a political party.
[01:56:25.062 --> 01:56:30.885]  But not if you don't expect to have to face any free, fair, honest elections.
[01:56:31.845 --> 01:56:33.506]  Which leads me to my belief.
[01:56:34.218 --> 01:56:39.084]  That before the next election, we will have another pandemic.
[01:56:40.005 --> 01:56:43.009]  Another plandemic, perhaps I should say.
[01:56:43.750 --> 01:56:46.133]  Some believe it will be a monkey pox.
[01:56:46.594 --> 01:56:51.400]  Although I think our problem today is more better described as donkey pox.
[01:56:52.548 --> 01:57:07.485]  But any excuse to give Joe Biden the ability to sign a executive order that mandates that there can be no in-person voting and that all voting must be done by mail-in ballot.
[01:57:08.496 --> 01:57:26.512]  Amazing that you have Attorney General Barr testifying for the January 6th Committee saying that the claims of election fraud are, to use his exact words, bullshit, when he admits in the next breath that he never actually investigated any of them.
[01:57:27.033 --> 01:57:29.495]  So, how would he know?
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:33.522]  I think Donald Trump's analysis is exactly right.
[01:57:34.063 --> 01:57:37.025]  Once Bill Barr was threatened with impeachment by the U.S.
[01:57:37.065 --> 01:57:49.094]  House and a Democratic majority in the Senate, not wanting to go down as the first Attorney General in history to be impeached, he began undermining the Trump administration.
[01:57:50.055 --> 01:58:04.669]   If President Trump had merely bothered to look at his Wikipedia entry and seen who he was, and that he had run the drug Trafficking operations for the CIA through Mina, Arkansas while working for George Bush.
[01:58:04.990 --> 01:58:08.734]  Perhaps he would never have appointed Bill Barr at all.
[01:58:09.335 --> 01:58:16.523]  And no, Bill Barr did not intercede with the prosecutors in my case to argue for a more lenient sentence.
[01:58:16.983 --> 01:58:30.283]  The Washington Post themselves have reported that the three top non-political career prosecutors at the Department of Justice testified under oath that that was entirely false.
[01:58:31.331 --> 01:58:35.433]  We're going to go to a message here from InfoWars.com in the store.
[01:58:35.833 --> 01:58:41.775]  That's because the left is wringing their hands right now about shutting down InfoWars.
[01:58:42.195 --> 01:58:45.616]  They believe this attack on Alex Jones has us on the run.
[01:58:46.057 --> 01:58:48.818]  They don't understand that we are committed to this fight.
[01:58:49.258 --> 01:58:57.761]  But in order to keep InfoWars out there as the beacon of freedom that it is, we really earnestly need your patronage.
[01:58:58.181 --> 01:59:00.883]  No, Alex Jones is not in it for the money.
[01:59:01.344 --> 01:59:03.685]  He's in it for the truth.
[01:59:04.466 --> 01:59:05.287]  Welcome back.
[01:59:06.107 --> 01:59:09.630]  I'm Roger Stone, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[01:59:10.270 --> 01:59:15.835]  So let's wrap up the hatchet job that CNN aired on Alex Jones last night.
[01:59:16.796 --> 01:59:27.664]  Funny, it doesn't cover the part about Secret Service agents suddenly appearing and offering to escort Alex Jones to the Capitol.
[01:59:28.405 --> 01:59:41.414]  Had Jones not stopped for a bathroom break, he would have arrived at the Capitol at the precise time that I believe government provocateurs were breaking into the U.S.
[01:59:41.494 --> 01:59:41.975]  Capitol.
[01:59:42.715 --> 01:59:54.204]  Funny, they also don't show Jones jumping up, I think, on a chair with a bullhorn, urging people to pull back, pointing out this is a peaceful demonstration.
[01:59:54.604 --> 01:59:56.165]  They truncated that.
[01:59:57.089 --> 02:00:19.254]  There is no connection as the FBI was reported to have concluded by Reuters some months ago that either Alex Jones or I were involved in any conspiracy to violate the law on January 6th or on any other date at any other location.
[02:00:20.234 --> 02:00:25.255]  This entire tactic is known as guilt by association.
[02:00:26.306 --> 02:00:30.411]  Do I know Donald Trump and do I speak to him occasionally?
[02:00:30.871 --> 02:00:31.192]  Yes.
[02:00:32.133 --> 02:00:34.095]  Do I know members of the Proud Boys?
[02:00:34.636 --> 02:00:34.976]  Yes.
[02:00:35.577 --> 02:00:39.341]  Did I come in contact with members of the Oath Keepers on January 5th?
[02:00:40.042 --> 02:00:40.382]  Yes.
[02:00:41.163 --> 02:00:45.008]  That proves absolutely, positively nothing.
[02:00:45.879 --> 02:00:50.221]  And so is the non-case against Alex Jones.
[02:00:50.762 --> 02:01:04.149]  So the special, which aired Sunday night, is an attempt to stampede the Justice Department into some kind of prosecution of Jones, who, like me, has done nothing wrong.
[02:01:05.338 --> 02:01:15.924]  The level of hatred and bloodlust among menopausal harpies on Twitter screaming that I need to be held accountable.
[02:01:16.024 --> 02:01:17.085]  Accountable for what?
[02:01:17.705 --> 02:01:18.526]  Knowing people?
[02:01:19.612 --> 02:01:20.733]  Let me say it again.
[02:01:20.753 --> 02:01:40.764]  There is no text message, no encrypted message, no email, no phone call, no witness that can tie me in any way to the wrongheaded and illegal actions at the Capitol on January 6th or on any other date or time.
[02:01:41.485 --> 02:01:53.768]  Any assertion to the contrary is categorically false, and no one, including the January 6th Committee, has been able to locate any evidence or proof to the contrary.
[02:01:54.729 --> 02:02:07.272]  I believe this is also the case when it comes to Alex Jones, who's been subjected to one of the most vicious attacks in American political or media history.
[02:02:08.228 --> 02:02:22.374]  But anyone who has any illusions about Alex Jones giving up or quitting or riding off into the sunset or ending his fight for America against the globalists does not understand Alex Jones.
[02:02:22.954 --> 02:02:25.135]  What you see is what you get.
[02:02:25.775 --> 02:02:26.616]  He is 100% patriot.
[02:02:30.347 --> 02:02:34.609]  Folks, I hate to complain and I hate to ask for help.
[02:02:35.389 --> 02:02:36.529]  It really pains me.
[02:02:36.569 --> 02:02:51.455]  But as I said earlier, my wife and I have been targeted in no less than 17 completely frivolous, groundless, unsubstantiated legal suits, civil suits against us.
[02:02:52.182 --> 02:03:09.946]  There is literally not a single month in which the total of my legal bills and the total of my wife's unpaid medical bills that were uninsured in her fight against stage 4 cancer do not exceed the amount of money that I made that month.
[02:03:10.046 --> 02:03:13.686]  So please go to StoneFamilyFund.com.
[02:03:14.106 --> 02:03:16.287]  StoneFamilyFund.com.
[02:03:16.907 --> 02:03:21.608]  I hate asking perhaps as much as you are tired of being asked.
[02:03:22.569 --> 02:03:25.393]  But I will not give up the fight for freedom.
[02:03:25.973 --> 02:03:32.742]  I will not plead to any phony civil suit financed by George Soros and his minions.
[02:03:33.343 --> 02:03:38.330]  And I will never stop fighting for freedom or appearing here on InfoWars.
[02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:53.610]  So, please, could you find it in your heart to send a contribution to the Stone Family Fund where Mrs. Stone and I are drowning in debt between our legal bills and her uninsured medical bills.
[02:03:54.131 --> 02:03:55.893]  God will bless you for it.
[02:03:59.219 --> 02:04:17.792]  Speaking of CNN, part of the overall scheme here is a special they ran Sunday night right after the hatchet job on Alex Jones on Watergate called Blueprint for Something or Other.
[02:04:18.432 --> 02:04:20.634]  We have a graphic here for it someplace.
[02:04:21.254 --> 02:04:25.317]  This is the second greatest act of fiction I have ever seen.
[02:04:25.917 --> 02:04:29.539]  This is supposedly the blueprint for scandal.
[02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:34.663]  One man's story of Watergate from the man that ended it.
[02:04:34.783 --> 02:04:35.743]  Now, let's be clear.
[02:04:36.084 --> 02:04:52.434]  John W. Dean is the man who conceived of, planned, pushed, and covered up the Watergate break-in, and then lied to President Richard Nixon for 19 straight months about it.
[02:04:53.158 --> 02:04:56.180]  Uh, everything in this hatchet job is fictional.
[02:04:56.800 --> 02:05:02.143]  Uh, we see Carl Bernstein lying about who Deep Throat really is.
[02:05:02.163 --> 02:05:16.451]   Uh, we see Tim Naftali, uh, an extremely angry gay man, a Nixon hater, but who's billed as the Founder and first director of the Nixon Presidential Library.
[02:05:16.971 --> 02:05:18.312]  Let me explain that to you.
[02:05:18.512 --> 02:05:47.835]   When the Nixon Library ceased to be privately funded through contributions, mostly because Nixon's many contemporaries had passed on, and therefore went under the control of the Federal Archivist, They inserted a Nixon-hating leftist and one of the most vile human beings I've ever met, Tim Naftali, a total piece of human garbage, as the director of the library.
[02:05:48.456 --> 02:06:16.734]  He would then take the Nixon library and refashion it to focus not on Nixon's historic breakthrough of strategic arm limitations with the Soviets, not with his historic desegregation of the public schools, not over his skillful playing off of the Chinese against the Russians by recognizing China at the time it had more oxen than it had automobiles.
[02:06:17.612 --> 02:06:26.255]  Unable to foresee the day when President George Bush would give them most favored nation trading status.
[02:06:27.236 --> 02:06:30.797]  But nothing about this narrative is true.
[02:06:31.277 --> 02:06:37.299]  John Dean lied to the Senate Intelligence Committee, pardon me, the Senate Watergate Committee.
[02:06:37.800 --> 02:06:42.581]  He lied under oath to the Watergate prosecutors.
[02:06:43.002 --> 02:06:44.442]  He was disbarred.
[02:06:44.962 --> 02:06:46.403]  He is the perp.
[02:06:46.963 --> 02:06:56.047]  He is the man who covered up Watergate and he lied to President Richard Nixon for nine long months about it.
[02:06:56.987 --> 02:06:59.088]  What's the significance to January 6th?
[02:06:59.368 --> 02:07:07.471]  Quite simply, who should pop up in the CNN special on Watergate but Michael Cohen.
[02:07:08.011 --> 02:07:12.053]  I checked, Michael Cohen was nine years old during Watergate.
[02:07:12.626 --> 02:07:14.067]  Why did they interview him?
[02:07:14.167 --> 02:07:21.912]  Well, he had to equate the character flaws of Richard Nixon with the character flaws of Donald Trump.
[02:07:22.413 --> 02:07:27.216]  The allegation that just as Nixon lied about Watergate, he wasn't lying.
[02:07:27.276 --> 02:07:29.817]  He'd been misled by his counsel, John Dean.
[02:07:30.278 --> 02:07:33.840]  Well, now Donald Trump is lying about January 6th.
[02:07:34.521 --> 02:07:37.943]  You see how it all fits together, folks.
[02:07:39.047 --> 02:07:40.928]  I want to remind you one more time.
[02:07:41.368 --> 02:07:46.471]  I wouldn't be able to be with you today without the support of InfoWars.
[02:07:46.891 --> 02:07:51.514]  And InfoWars can only stay afloat with your help.
[02:07:52.094 --> 02:07:55.596]  So the InfoWars Super Summer Sale has arrived.

[02:09:26.137 --> 02:09:28.578]  Ask me why I have such a gleaming smile.
[02:09:28.978 --> 02:09:32.600]  It's because I use Dr. Jones' charcoal toothpaste.
[02:09:32.920 --> 02:09:36.802]  It's a terrific product, the charcoal-based mouthwash.
[02:09:37.182 --> 02:09:43.044]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root, guest host as always on Tuesdays at noon, West Coast time.
[02:09:43.084 --> 02:09:44.425]  That's where I live in Las Vegas.
[02:09:44.965 --> 02:09:47.166]  Noon, West Coast time, three o'clock.
[02:09:47.746 --> 02:09:51.948]  East Coast time, guest hosting on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:09:55.010 --> 02:09:56.931]  Why is my screen blank?
[02:09:56.991 --> 02:09:57.591]  I have no idea.
[02:09:57.832 --> 02:09:58.332]  Are we on?
[02:09:59.012 --> 02:09:59.793]  There we go!
[02:09:59.833 --> 02:10:01.093]  I was wondering what was going on there.
[02:10:01.533 --> 02:10:04.375]  If I can't see myself on the screen, I'm thinking we're not on.
[02:10:04.395 --> 02:10:05.295]  I thought something was wrong.
[02:10:05.315 --> 02:10:05.716]  We're on.
[02:10:06.236 --> 02:10:06.836]  Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:10:07.237 --> 02:10:08.877]  Rootforamerica.com is the website.
[02:10:08.897 --> 02:10:13.560]  WayneRootatgmail.com is my email and we are off and running.
[02:10:14.020 --> 02:10:15.380]  All right, so lots of things to tell you about.
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:17.781]  It's going to be a very special show for me.
[02:10:18.241 --> 02:10:22.862]  Number one, I interviewed President Donald J. Trump yesterday on my national radio show.
[02:10:22.882 --> 02:10:24.043]  It was also videotaped.
[02:10:24.443 --> 02:10:25.823]  The audio is out now.
[02:10:25.923 --> 02:10:32.405]  The video will be out preferably, hopefully tomorrow, Thursday at the latest, the video version.
[02:10:33.374 --> 02:10:44.712]  But I have lots to tell you about what President Trump had to say, and I have lots to tell you about a new commentary I've just written about Justin Bieber and Ray Liotta!
[02:10:45.504 --> 02:10:46.144]  In Hollywood.
[02:10:46.605 --> 02:10:48.866]  One died, the other has facial paralysis.
[02:10:49.286 --> 02:10:56.129]  And we all know everyone in Hollywood has drank the vaccine, COVID vaccine, Kool-Aid.
[02:10:56.449 --> 02:10:57.710]  They're all Stepford Wives.
[02:10:58.170 --> 02:11:01.892]  So you can absolutely bet that Justin Bieber is vaccinated.
[02:11:01.912 --> 02:11:04.553]  You can absolutely bet that Ray Liotta was vaccinated.
[02:11:04.573 --> 02:11:09.155]  You can't get on a movie or a TV set or step on a music stage without being vaccinated.
[02:11:09.495 --> 02:11:10.236]  And it's happening.
[02:11:10.276 --> 02:11:12.917]  The shoe is dropping all over the world.
[02:11:13.849 --> 02:11:17.591]  There's Ray Liotta's picture, and I'm a great fan of Ray Liotta.
[02:11:19.452 --> 02:11:24.735]  And Justin Bieber and his wife, both injured and both, again, this is an opinion show.
[02:11:25.196 --> 02:11:26.096]  It's my opinion.
[02:11:26.136 --> 02:11:27.117]  They're public figures.
[02:11:27.557 --> 02:11:34.661]  It's clear to me they're part of the vaccine injury and death disaster going on in the United States of America.
[02:11:35.649 --> 02:11:40.471]  So I'll talk about my Donald Trump interview coming up in the next segment.
[02:11:40.491 --> 02:11:41.571]  I want to make this a mystery.
[02:11:41.611 --> 02:11:52.336]  I want you to hold on and get excited because there were some huge eye-opening revelations because Trump and I are great friends and have been for a long time and he's very comfortable around me.
[02:11:52.716 --> 02:11:53.776]  So it wasn't an interview.
[02:11:53.836 --> 02:11:57.738]  It was like two great friends talking and you got to listen in.
[02:11:58.218 --> 02:12:08.175]   And so because he's a little bit looser than in a normal interview and not on guard, He said some things that I think are very important for everyone to hear.
[02:12:08.676 --> 02:12:13.381]  And I think that the media will take some of them and make them into headlines around the world.
[02:12:13.821 --> 02:12:18.586]  Just as we did last year, not last year, but maybe about six, eight months ago.
[02:12:19.046 --> 02:12:24.672]  I was the guy who created the idea of Trump becoming house speaker.
[02:12:25.447 --> 02:12:28.872]  He needs to be House Speaker, I said, and he said, great idea!
[02:12:29.272 --> 02:12:31.114]  I like that, I've never heard it from anyone before!
[02:12:31.515 --> 02:12:34.559]  And I said it to him right on live radio.
[02:12:35.140 --> 02:12:38.424]  And so, all of a sudden that became headlines all over the world!
[02:12:38.905 --> 02:12:43.671]  Literally, all over the United States and all over the world, was that Wayne Root said to Donald Trump, you should be House Speaker.
[02:12:44.671 --> 02:12:48.954]  And what many of them didn't know was a lot of them said, but it was Steve Bannon's original idea.
[02:12:48.974 --> 02:12:49.734]  I love Steve Bannon.
[02:12:50.074 --> 02:12:52.215]  He's a friend of mine, too, but sorry, Steve.
[02:12:52.235 --> 02:12:53.016]  It was my idea.
[02:12:53.396 --> 02:12:58.359]  Steve Bannon first spoke about it at a speech in Boston, and I think it was February of 2021.
[02:13:00.421 --> 02:13:06.729]  And I was the guy who brought the idea up and wrote it in a column in January of 2021.
[02:13:07.069 --> 02:13:09.993]  I think it was two weeks after Biden was sworn in as president.
[02:13:10.414 --> 02:13:12.977]  I wrote a column and said, Trump's got to be Speaker of the House.
[02:13:13.338 --> 02:13:17.143]  And I'll tell you the significance of why Trump needs to be Speaker of the House.
[02:13:17.983 --> 02:13:24.366]  And wait till you hear what Trump had to say about it, because everyone assumes that he will not do that because he endorsed Kevin McCarthy.
[02:13:24.406 --> 02:13:27.927]  But I have breaking news for you from my interview with President Trump.
[02:13:28.287 --> 02:13:30.868]  But I need to explain why he needs to be Speaker of the House.
[02:13:31.568 --> 02:13:41.292]  Because he can lead the impeachment of Biden and Kamala Harris for the crimes and the treason they've committed against the United States.
[02:13:41.612 --> 02:13:45.654]  And once they're both thrown out of office, guess who's next in line to be President?
[02:13:46.297 --> 02:13:50.499]  Speaker of the House, that's how Donald Trump becomes President of the House quickly.
[02:13:50.519 --> 02:13:53.081]  Because I don't believe we can wait until 2024.
[02:13:53.421 --> 02:13:55.642]  I don't believe this country will last until 2024.
[02:13:55.742 --> 02:13:58.124]  And I asked President Trump about that.
[02:13:58.644 --> 02:13:59.264]  And guess what?
[02:13:59.504 --> 02:14:02.226]  He had a wild answer that you're going to want to hear.
[02:14:03.249 --> 02:14:05.251]  About whether America can last till 2024.
[02:14:05.291 --> 02:14:11.518]  Wayne Allyn Root, RootForAmerica.com and my email, WayneRootAtGmail.com.
[02:14:11.758 --> 02:14:12.519]  We'll be right back.
[02:14:12.979 --> 02:14:19.826]  More about Justin Bieber, Ray Liotta, my commentary about the COVID vaccine and my interview with President Donald J. Trump.
[02:14:20.146 --> 02:14:26.212]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root, RootForAmerica.com, my show nationwide, nationwide syndicated radio.

[02:14:41.525 --> 02:14:52.393]   West Coast time, Monday through Friday, five days a week, syndicated national radio, or you go to USA Radio, Alright, so I'm going to get to the details of my Trump interview in a few minutes.
[02:14:52.433 --> 02:14:53.474]  I want to keep you in suspense.
[02:14:53.914 --> 02:14:55.395]  Very important ground was covered.
[02:14:55.715 --> 02:14:57.337]  But I want to read you my column now.
[02:14:57.357 --> 02:14:58.757]  I want to read you my column.
[02:14:59.158 --> 02:15:00.739]  My column will be out the next day.
[02:15:01.379 --> 02:15:02.340]  You're the first to hear it.
[02:15:02.780 --> 02:15:10.565]  The title is, will the whole Hollywood soon be either dead like Ray Liotta or paralyzed like Justin Bieber?
[02:15:10.885 --> 02:15:14.728]  Will they still trust the lies of government and the CDC?
[02:15:15.488 --> 02:15:16.388]  That's my title.
[02:15:16.828 --> 02:15:27.511]  Now I want to state up front again, I'm an opinion guy, I'm a commentator, these are my opinions, and these are public figures at which all of us have a right to ask questions.
[02:15:28.331 --> 02:15:32.012]  So I'll get to Justin Bieber and Ray Liotta in just a minute.
[02:15:32.532 --> 02:15:41.674]  But first I want to explain why I know and understand liberal Democrats who worship the vaccine god better than any conservative in America.
[02:15:42.449 --> 02:15:46.071]  It's because I've known nothing but Liberal Democrats all my life.
[02:15:46.632 --> 02:15:51.515]  I grew up on a dead-end street on the Bronx borderline in a majority-minority city.
[02:15:52.216 --> 02:15:58.880]  I attended an almost 100% Black middle school and almost a 90% Black high school.
[02:15:59.520 --> 02:16:01.922]  And almost everyone I knew was a Democrat.
[02:16:02.542 --> 02:16:06.465]  I grew up Jewish, attended synagogue, and was bar mitzvahed.
[02:16:07.526 --> 02:16:14.719]   Almost every Jew I knew was a Democrat, from my rabbi To my own uncle and aunt.
[02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:21.265]  I accepted, I was accepted into Columbia University, one of the finest Ivy League colleges in America.
[02:16:21.785 --> 02:16:32.135]  Forget Democrats, virtually every human being there, classmate and professor, identified and bragged to me that they were either Socialists, Marxists, or Communists.
[02:16:33.712 --> 02:16:45.773]  I became host of five television shows on Financial News Network, now known as CNBC, and everyone I met in journalism, broadcasting, television and media was an ultra-liberal Democrat.
[02:16:45.893 --> 02:16:46.274]  Everyone.
[02:16:46.937 --> 02:16:52.442]  I lived for 13 years in Malibu, California, and everyone I met in Malibu was an ultra-liberal Democrat.
[02:16:52.822 --> 02:17:04.191]  And one more unique tidbit of my life, I'm a lifelong health food and vitamin enthusiast, and for decades, almost everyone I met in vitamin stores identified as liberal Democrats.
[02:17:04.852 --> 02:17:11.677]  So I've been living and working around liberal Democrats, socialists, Marxists, and communists my entire life.
[02:17:11.837 --> 02:17:16.441]  I may understand them better than any conservative or Republican in America.
[02:17:17.148 --> 02:17:27.791]  And never, never, ever did politics, or Liberal Democrat politics in particular, ever have anything to do with medicine or vaccines.
[02:17:28.431 --> 02:17:45.676]  Actually, to the contrary, most of the Liberal Democrats I've met in my life were cynical, anti-establishment, never trusted anything politicians or government told them, hated and distrusted Big Pharma, and were almost always anti-vaccine.
[02:17:46.889 --> 02:17:53.773]  Most of the Birkenstock crowd that I met in vitamin stores and health stores would not allow their children to be vaccinated.
[02:17:54.194 --> 02:18:01.538]  Most of the liberal mothers I met over the years, and I lived in Manhattan, the Hollywood Hills below the Hollywood sign, and Malibu.
[02:18:01.919 --> 02:18:04.160]  So I know liberal mothers better than anyone.
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:09.103]  Most of them did not trust vaccines and believe vaccines caused autism.
[02:18:10.484 --> 02:18:11.825]  So how did we get here?
[02:18:12.685 --> 02:18:28.551]  Because right now, at this moment in time, Liberal Democrats and assorted Socialist Marxists and Communists who make up the Democrat Party, and in particular everyone in Hollywood and the entertainment industry, have spent the past 18 months in a spell!
[02:18:29.331 --> 02:18:31.092]  Mass psychosis!
[02:18:31.652 --> 02:18:33.773]  A Stepford Wife trance!
[02:18:34.273 --> 02:18:40.375]  A Jim Jones of Guyana-like, Kool-Aid drinking, mass brainwashing event!
[02:18:41.129 --> 02:18:44.771]  The liberal Democrats I've known my whole life were mostly atheists.
[02:18:45.331 --> 02:18:51.695]  Yet, today, suddenly, every Democrat I meet believes in God, and they've all found religion.
[02:18:52.255 --> 02:18:58.418]  Their God of choice is the COVID vaccine, and their religion is vaccinology.
[02:18:59.098 --> 02:19:03.721]  They love vaccinology so much, many of them have switched from Scientology!
[02:19:04.753 --> 02:19:06.894]  Their liberal crowd is filled with addicts.
[02:19:07.574 --> 02:19:08.275]  Drug addicts.
[02:19:08.455 --> 02:19:09.275]  Alcohol addicts.
[02:19:09.715 --> 02:19:10.396]  Sex addicts.
[02:19:10.416 --> 02:19:11.656]  They all go to AA meetings.
[02:19:12.116 --> 02:19:15.498]  But now their addiction of choice is the COVID vaccine!
[02:19:16.058 --> 02:19:16.738]  The needle!
[02:19:17.459 --> 02:19:21.961]  And instead of AA meetings, soon they'll be attending VA meetings.
[02:19:22.321 --> 02:19:23.822]  Vaccine Anonymous.
[02:19:25.035 --> 02:19:31.805]  Suddenly every liberal Democrat in Hollywood loves COVID vaccines like Christians love Jesus Christ.
[02:19:32.346 --> 02:19:33.468]  They worship the needle.
[02:19:33.808 --> 02:19:36.873]  They're desperate for boosters for their boosters!
[02:19:37.799 --> 02:19:40.040]  Suddenly Democrats ask no questions.
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:43.121]  They trust everything that Big Pharma tells them.
[02:19:43.621 --> 02:19:48.042]  They hate capitalism and anyone who makes money, they call them greedy.
[02:19:48.443 --> 02:20:01.247]  Yet Big Pharma committing fraud and covering up vaccine injuries and deaths to make trillions of dollars and turn Big Pharma executives into billionaires doesn't bother them in the slightest.
[02:20:02.196 --> 02:20:06.877]  If a brain-dead zombie puppet with diapers and dementia, i.e.
[02:20:06.917 --> 02:20:14.399]  Joe Biden, tells them the vaccine is safe, they just roll up their sleeves and say, your wish is my command!
[02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:20.661]  Hollywood limousine liberals want the COVID vaccine god on the back of coins.
[02:20:21.221 --> 02:20:22.942]  In Vax, we trust.
[02:20:23.782 --> 02:20:27.983]  Funny, but doesn't this sound a lot like what happened under Stalin?
[02:20:28.684 --> 02:20:29.224]  And Hitler?
[02:20:29.664 --> 02:20:30.465]  And Castro?
[02:20:30.845 --> 02:20:32.785]  And Reverend Jim Jones in Guyana?
[02:20:33.886 --> 02:20:54.672]  All over the world, athletes, politicians, actors, rock stars, and television celebrities have been dying suddenly or suffering cardiac arrest, heart issues, strokes, blood clots, and massive increases in cancer all since 2021 and the advent of the vaccine.
[02:20:55.968 --> 02:21:01.891]  Athlete deaths are up 1,700%, as in 1,700%.
[02:21:03.993 --> 02:21:08.435]  FIFA, as in pro soccer deaths, are up five-fold.
[02:21:09.035 --> 02:21:11.757]  Almost 100% are heart-related.
[02:21:12.097 --> 02:21:14.919]  They're dropping dead on the soccer field.
[02:21:15.519 --> 02:21:22.023]  Millennial deaths are up by a staggering 84% since the advent of the vaccine.
[02:21:22.443 --> 02:21:23.884]  The numbers are shocking.
[02:21:24.591 --> 02:21:27.812]  Ask any life insurance executive or funeral homeowner.
[02:21:28.213 --> 02:21:29.593]  Ask any cardiac nurse.
[02:21:30.093 --> 02:21:31.514]  Study the VAERS report.
[02:21:32.074 --> 02:21:34.255]  But now it's hitting home in Hollywood.
[02:21:34.635 --> 02:21:39.317]  In recent weeks, one of my favorite actors, Ray Liotta, died in his sleep on the set of his latest movie.
[02:21:40.091 --> 02:21:41.152]  Was he vaccinated?
[02:21:41.332 --> 02:21:46.076]  Almost certainly, because no actor can get on a movie set without proof of vaccination.
[02:21:46.636 --> 02:21:53.021]  We don't know whether it's COVID vaccine related, but we can certainly guess, and we should certainly be asking questions.
[02:21:53.342 --> 02:21:54.683]  We should certainly investigate.
[02:21:54.983 --> 02:22:02.023]   And then only days ago, 28 year old superstar singer, Justin Bieber went public with his face paralysis
[02:22:02.023 --> 02:22:08.143]   from a rare disease called Ramsey-Hunt syndrome from a virus in the shingles family.
[02:22:08.143 --> 02:22:10.742]  Bieber was forced to cancel his latest tour.
[02:22:10.742 --> 02:22:17.201]   Shockingly, his 26 year old wife had a mini stroke unexpectedly only weeks ago.
[02:22:17.201 --> 02:22:22.522]   These are medical conditions that mimic vaccine injuries happening all over the world.
[02:22:22.522 --> 02:22:28.802]   Where Bieber and his young wife vaccinated almost certainly his fans are not even allowed
[02:22:28.802 --> 02:22:32.763]  to attend his concerts without proof of vaccination.
[02:22:32.938 --> 02:22:35.381]  So, are his injuries from the vaccine?
[02:22:35.741 --> 02:22:39.285]  Is his wife, 26-year-old wife's stroke from the vaccine?
[02:22:39.585 --> 02:22:43.810]  We can only guess, but we're allowed to ask questions and we're allowed to investigate.
[02:22:44.450 --> 02:22:48.092]  All over the world, vaccine injuries and deaths are piling up.
[02:22:48.653 --> 02:23:03.302]  Hundreds of studies from around the globe report the COVID vaccine damages the immune system and results in dramatic increases in heart attacks, heart inflammation, strokes, blood clots, cancer, and terrible outbreaks of shingles and facial paralysis.
[02:23:03.942 --> 02:23:13.326]   Liberal Hollywood Has lapped up the lies, misinformation, and world-class cover-up by the government, the media, and the CDC, like no other group in the world.
[02:23:13.726 --> 02:23:20.129]  You can't step stage in Hollywood or anywhere in the entertainment industry without proof of vaccination.
[02:23:20.609 --> 02:23:22.670]  Bieber and his wife are the tip of the iceberg.
[02:23:23.090 --> 02:23:27.973]  Soon we'll be seeing and hearing about a tsunami of Justin Bieber's and Ray Liotta's.
[02:23:28.433 --> 02:23:29.934]  Which star is next?
[02:23:30.554 --> 02:23:44.042]   The question I close with is, In this celebrity-obsessed world, what famous celebrity's death will be the tipping point that wakes the world up to this unfolding tragedy?
[02:23:44.523 --> 02:23:56.710]  When your grandma, your mother, your father, your sister, your child dies, maybe you don't get it, but when you start to see your favorite celebrity die, it will all start to hit home.
[02:23:57.471 --> 02:24:00.167]   Wayne Allyn Root, Wayne Root at gmail.com.
[02:24:00.448 --> 02:24:01.849]  Rootforamerica.com.
[02:24:02.149 --> 02:24:04.191]  Guest hosting on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:04.451 --> 02:24:05.372]  I'm an opinion guy.
[02:24:05.712 --> 02:24:06.833]  This is my opinion.
[02:24:07.253 --> 02:24:08.314]  Alright, Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:24:08.334 --> 02:24:08.815]  Welcome back.
[02:24:08.855 --> 02:24:10.136]  Rootforamerica.com.
[02:24:10.756 --> 02:24:12.918]  Wayne Root at gmail.com.
[02:24:13.239 --> 02:24:14.620]  Want to make sure you know how to contact me.
[02:24:14.700 --> 02:24:15.741]  Love to hear from all of you.
[02:24:16.321 --> 02:24:17.442]  Wayne Root at gmail.com.
[02:24:17.462 --> 02:24:33.672]  I get a couple thousand or more emails each week and I study every one of them and read every one of them, review every one of them, and a lot of the things you say to me are what wind up being my columns in the coming days after that or wind up being the top stories I talk about on my radio show.
[02:24:33.752 --> 02:24:35.913]  I am a man of the people is what I am.
[02:24:35.973 --> 02:24:39.736]  I love to hear what you think and what you think is what I want to talk about.
[02:24:41.189 --> 02:24:46.373]  I told you that I have the Donald Trump interview, and I told you I'd get to it, so I will.
[02:24:46.453 --> 02:24:49.675]  I want to mention my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:24:49.695 --> 02:24:57.880]  You can find it at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, anywhere fine books are sold, but Amazon is certainly the easiest way to get my book, and they've always got it in stock.
[02:24:57.900 --> 02:25:25.434]   The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book gives you a list of the 116 companies in America that are the most woke The most liberal, the most, you know, in-your-face against conservatives, offensive to conservatives, spitting in the face of conservatives and yet they make billions of dollars because we're the biggest buyers of their product and it's time to change all that and hit back with what Dr. Martin Luther King would call civil disobedience.
[02:25:26.034 --> 02:25:38.587]  And so I've written a book about civil disobedience and I've given you the names of all the CEOs and the board of directors and how do you contact each of these companies via phone and email and social media and their websites and everything else is in there.
[02:25:38.747 --> 02:25:42.471]  All the information is in there to go after them and let them know you're not going to buy from them anymore.
[02:25:42.831 --> 02:25:45.352]  All right, my Donald Trump interview yesterday.
[02:25:45.392 --> 02:25:46.772]  So it was on national radio.
[02:25:47.252 --> 02:25:55.034]  I had a camera rolling with my trusty producer, director, videographer, who's been with me for 35 years, Patar, who's standing here now.
[02:25:55.094 --> 02:25:55.854]  Thank you, Patar.
[02:25:56.274 --> 02:26:02.616]  So it'll be on video available tomorrow at my website, Root4America.com.
[02:26:02.636 --> 02:26:03.056]  Tomorrow?
[02:26:03.096 --> 02:26:03.716]  You think tomorrow?
[02:26:04.296 --> 02:26:05.597]  Maybe tomorrow, maybe Thursday.
[02:26:05.637 --> 02:26:06.038]  We'll see.
[02:26:06.278 --> 02:26:10.561]  We're getting it edited and putting all the graphics on it, and it's a nice video.
[02:26:10.581 --> 02:26:13.524]  So we'll have it in the next, let's say, 24 to 48 hours.
[02:26:13.884 --> 02:26:16.986]  But the audio version is out right now.
[02:26:17.747 --> 02:26:26.934]  And I gotta tell you, there's some things about my interviews with Trump that my own audience, my own fans tell me, and then I noticed it after they said it to me.
[02:26:27.254 --> 02:26:27.875]  See, I listen to you.
[02:26:28.610 --> 02:26:37.953]  And I had so many emails yesterday after listening to my interview that said, you do an interview with Trump like no one else in the country because it isn't a media interview.
[02:26:38.413 --> 02:26:42.514]  It's like we are all let in on a secret conversation between two friends.
[02:26:43.114 --> 02:26:48.156]  Trump and I are very comfortable with each other and he lets his guard down and talks to me like a friend.
[02:26:48.756 --> 02:26:54.138]  And I, you know, I was there from the first day he came down the escalator, and I said, that's the next President of the United States.
[02:26:54.278 --> 02:26:56.079]  He was at 1% in the polls at that point.
[02:26:57.139 --> 02:27:03.261]  And he sent me a note in the mail and said, thank you for the wonderful column you just wrote in Fox News, saying I'm the next President of the United States.
[02:27:03.302 --> 02:27:04.162]  I really appreciate it.
[02:27:04.522 --> 02:27:06.123]  You know, you're the greatest, Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:27:06.503 --> 02:27:12.465]  From that moment on, everything I wrote, he sent me correspondence, handwritten, saying how much he enjoyed it.
[02:27:12.905 --> 02:27:32.445]  And then sometimes he'd ask me to write certain things, write about certain topics, or point them out on my radio or TV interviews, and eventually I got my national radio show, and eventually I was the number one host on Newsmax TV for three years and over 700 episodes, and he would send me notes and tell me some of the things he wanted me to talk about, and some of the things I ought to investigate!
[02:27:33.459 --> 02:27:36.900]  And so we became kind of pen pals more than anything else.
[02:27:37.181 --> 02:27:38.781]  He'd send me notes, I'd send him notes back.
[02:27:39.381 --> 02:27:40.562]  We met on several occasions.
[02:27:40.642 --> 02:27:50.886]  I was his opening speaker at seven speeches in Las Vegas when he ran for president and then his first, actually six when he ran for president, and then his first speech back to Vegas.
[02:27:51.426 --> 02:28:00.331]  As President of the United States, about a year after he was elected, he personally asked his advance man in the Secret Service to call me and I should be the opening speaker for that event in Las Vegas.
[02:28:00.451 --> 02:28:03.112]  All of these 10,000 to 15,000 people in the audience.
[02:28:03.572 --> 02:28:06.954]  So it's been a great experience for me, getting to know President Trump.
[02:28:07.334 --> 02:28:10.396]  And he started to rely on me as the Vegas odds maker, would give him his odds.
[02:28:10.796 --> 02:28:14.618]  And my predictions on whether he'd win the election, I kept telling him, you're going to win.
[02:28:14.778 --> 02:28:16.079]  And he kept saying to me, really?
[02:28:16.099 --> 02:28:17.299]  Are you sure about that?
[02:28:17.319 --> 02:28:18.100]  I'm going to beat Hillary?
[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:19.140]  And I'd say, yes.
[02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:20.721]  And he'd say, wow, really?
[02:28:21.201 --> 02:28:22.182]  He just didn't think.
[02:28:22.563 --> 02:28:24.545]  At first, I don't think he thought he had a chance to win.
[02:28:24.966 --> 02:28:27.209]  But I think I gave him a lot of confidence that he'd win.
[02:28:27.609 --> 02:28:28.290]  And he did win.
[02:28:28.310 --> 02:28:29.852]  And after that, he appreciated it.
[02:28:29.892 --> 02:28:31.013]  And we've been friends ever since.
[02:28:31.394 --> 02:28:34.318]  I just enjoyed my honeymoon at Bar-a-Lago at his residence.
[02:28:35.555 --> 02:28:41.457]  It was a great honor, and then about two weeks later, I flew back to Florida and gave a speech in Palm Beach with President Trump.
[02:28:41.477 --> 02:28:45.419]  It was a Wayne Root-President Trump speech, and the two of us were on the stage together.
[02:28:45.479 --> 02:28:54.882]  So, you know, listen, I appreciate the guy, he appreciates me, and it's a friendship that leads to these interviews that are very different than your average interview.
[02:28:54.902 --> 02:28:55.442]  Very loose.
[02:28:56.103 --> 02:29:03.145]  Let me tell you, over the rest of the show, some of the points, some of the key points that came out of my interview with President Trump yesterday.
[02:29:03.626 --> 02:29:04.726]  Let's start with number one.
[02:29:05.366 --> 02:29:15.730]  I am the guy who came up with the idea for President Trump to be Speaker of the House, and I'm the guy that believes, and has been writing about this, that America is about to go under.
[02:29:16.030 --> 02:29:18.031]  That we're not going to make it to 2024.
[02:29:18.491 --> 02:29:20.331]  I don't even know that we're going to make it to November.
[02:29:20.672 --> 02:29:21.692]  That's how bad things are.
[02:29:22.112 --> 02:29:26.576]  And I asked President Trump about that in the interview as well, and you might be interested in his answer.
[02:29:26.956 --> 02:29:36.084]  But the more important one is Speaker of the House, because I believe that he is the only one that could lead to the impeachment of Biden and Kamala Harris, both of them.
[02:29:36.604 --> 02:29:38.866]  And if he does, then he's third in line to be president.
[02:29:39.146 --> 02:29:40.888]  He'd be president of the United States, hypothetically.
[02:29:41.308 --> 02:29:43.030]  So we need him now.
[02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:45.432]  There's no time to wait to 2024.
[02:29:45.572 --> 02:29:46.132]  We cannot wait.
[02:29:49.028 --> 02:29:56.090]  So I suggested several months ago, I guess it was in, I was probably April of 2021, I think.
[02:29:56.610 --> 02:29:58.911]  It was about a year ago, a little over a year ago.
[02:29:59.251 --> 02:30:02.492]  And I said, you ought to be the Speaker of the House.
[02:30:02.552 --> 02:30:04.233]  Run for the Speaker of the House and be the Speaker of the House.
[02:30:04.953 --> 02:30:08.434]  And so on my show yesterday, here's the important news.
[02:30:09.094 --> 02:30:17.537]  And so I know you're showing all these great scenes of President Trump, but if you can, Alex Jones producers, show me on the screen, because I want to talk to the people one-on-one.
[02:30:17.577 --> 02:30:18.057]  Now, there we go.
[02:30:18.783 --> 02:30:23.446]  So I said to President Trump, live, you need to be Speaker of the House.
[02:30:24.087 --> 02:30:29.790]  And you really, I can't believe that you endorsed Kevin McCarthy as Speaker.
[02:30:30.311 --> 02:30:31.391]  You need to be Speaker.
[02:30:31.692 --> 02:30:33.493]  McCarthy will not get the job done.
[02:30:34.013 --> 02:30:39.937]  And this should be national news, and I'll bet it will be after the media watches me on the Alex Jones Show and then watches my interview.
[02:30:40.623 --> 02:30:44.405]  Trump responded to me and said, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:30:44.925 --> 02:30:47.247]  I never endorsed Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House.
[02:30:47.647 --> 02:30:50.548]  I did not endorse Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House.
[02:30:50.989 --> 02:30:56.452]  I only endorsed Kevin McCarthy for his run for re-election to his House seat.
[02:30:57.132 --> 02:31:01.995]  See, everyone in America, including me, watched all the headlines, Trump endorsed McCarthy.
[02:31:02.295 --> 02:31:04.296]  And a lot of Trump fans got very angry at that.
[02:31:04.676 --> 02:31:07.847]   I had hundreds of emails saying, Your boy Trump!
[02:31:08.287 --> 02:31:09.748]  Why is he endorsing McCarthy?
[02:31:09.768 --> 02:31:10.749]  McCarthy doesn't like him!
[02:31:10.789 --> 02:31:12.010]  McCarthy stabs him in the back!
[02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:13.271]  McCarthy's no good!
[02:31:13.551 --> 02:31:14.672]  He's not a good House Speaker!
[02:31:14.712 --> 02:31:15.393]  Him and McConnell!
[02:31:15.633 --> 02:31:16.173]  Gotta go!
[02:31:16.193 --> 02:31:16.674]  And I agree!
[02:31:17.412 --> 02:31:21.075]  Well, Trump said live on national radio, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:31:21.415 --> 02:31:24.177]  I did not endorse Kevin McCarthy for House Speaker.
[02:31:24.497 --> 02:31:25.157]  I did not.
[02:31:25.237 --> 02:31:26.058]  That's not true.
[02:31:26.458 --> 02:31:29.320]  I only endorsed his re-election for Congress.
[02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:33.383]  And I said, well, then you need to be the House Speaker.
[02:31:33.423 --> 02:31:35.264]  You need to run for House Speaker.
[02:31:35.664 --> 02:31:46.151]  And let me paraphrase, not in front of me the exact words, but basically what Trump responded was, OK, Wayne, we'll save that one for a private conversation at another time soon.
[02:31:46.672 --> 02:31:47.072]  You and me.
[02:31:47.692 --> 02:31:51.257]  And I thought that was a interesting and shocking answer.
[02:31:51.277 --> 02:31:57.283]  Because what it sounds like he's saying is, I'm leaving my options open to be Speaker of the House.
[02:31:57.824 --> 02:31:59.686]  No, I didn't endorse McCarthy as Speaker.
[02:32:00.147 --> 02:32:03.671]  And you and I could talk about this in a future time in private.
[02:32:04.011 --> 02:32:07.692]  Maybe he'll talk about why he will run and why he doesn't want to disclose it now.
[02:32:08.052 --> 02:32:11.173]  Maybe it would affect FEC fundraising regulations.
[02:32:11.553 --> 02:32:17.254]  Or maybe what he'd say to me is, I can't run for reason X, Y, and Z. I've got to help Kevin McCarthy.
[02:32:17.515 --> 02:32:23.136]  But if that's the case, why would he say to me, no, no, no, no, I did not endorse Kevin McCarthy as Speaker.
[02:32:23.636 --> 02:32:26.277]  I think this is huge national news.
[02:32:26.777 --> 02:32:30.519]  My idea is still in his mind, percolating.
[02:32:30.859 --> 02:32:34.980]  And he's thinking about what he might do, but first we have to win the House.
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:40.282]  He's not going to say it now, because it might interfere with us winning the House by a massive landslide.
[02:32:40.602 --> 02:32:42.923]  He's not going to say a word until after we win the House.
[02:32:43.243 --> 02:32:50.106]  But my gut instinct says, after this interview, that he likes my idea, and he may very well run for Speaker of the House.
[02:32:50.826 --> 02:32:53.368]  Alright Wayne Allyn Roon, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:53.388 --> 02:32:59.952]  I'm guest host as I do this every Tuesday at 12 noon West Coast time, 3 o'clock East Coast time.
[02:33:00.012 --> 02:33:01.332]  Love to be with you each week.
[02:33:01.372 --> 02:33:04.674]  Matter of fact, I have a couple of emails that came in during the break.
[02:33:04.734 --> 02:33:05.675]  I'd like to read them to you.
[02:33:05.695 --> 02:33:07.276]  A couple of very nice emails.
[02:33:08.096 --> 02:33:09.817]  Craig says, love your high energy.
[02:33:10.198 --> 02:33:12.779]  You're one of my favorite guest hosts on InfoWars.
[02:33:12.799 --> 02:33:13.680]  You know what I say to Craig?
[02:33:14.040 --> 02:33:15.781]  I'm only one of your favorite guest hosts?
[02:33:17.400 --> 02:33:18.800]  We've also got one from Edward.
[02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:23.882]  Edward says, you and Gerard, Gerald Solante, should co-host a show together.
[02:33:23.922 --> 02:33:24.822]  You two are unbeatable.
[02:33:25.262 --> 02:33:28.403]  I think you pick up the spirits of the InfoWars audience.
[02:33:28.963 --> 02:33:32.624]  And there are many, many more here, but I grabbed two of them at random that I thought were very nice.
[02:33:32.664 --> 02:33:34.004]  Thank you both for the nice sentiments.
[02:33:34.384 --> 02:33:36.105]  I really appreciate them, and I'd love to hear from you.
[02:33:36.405 --> 02:33:46.467]  WayneRoot at Gmail.com and RootForAmerica.com, where you can listen to my national radio show every day, my podcast every day, my weekend video podcast.
[02:33:46.767 --> 02:33:50.710]  My video commentaries, all of them at root4america.com.
[02:33:50.751 --> 02:33:51.131]  There it is.
[02:33:51.471 --> 02:33:52.192]  There's the website.
[02:33:52.472 --> 02:33:53.993]  So let's go back to my Trump interview.
[02:33:54.033 --> 02:33:56.535]  Lots of ground that I think was broken.
[02:33:56.556 --> 02:33:59.558]  Eye-opening revelations and responses.
[02:33:59.978 --> 02:34:09.284]   Because he's at ease with me, because we're friends, He said some things that I think are important for you to know, and I think a lot of people will stand up and take notice.
[02:34:09.684 --> 02:34:17.708]  So number one, if you just weren't with us, I asked him about becoming House Speaker, running for House Speaker, because we need him, because the country won't survive till 2024.
[02:34:18.068 --> 02:34:19.889]  We've got to shortcut the time.
[02:34:20.329 --> 02:34:23.511]  And his answer was, you know, and I said, and why did you endorse?
[02:34:24.131 --> 02:34:26.073]  Kevin McCarthy as House Speaker.
[02:34:26.093 --> 02:34:27.975]  And his answer was, I didn't endorse Kevin McCarthy.
[02:34:28.295 --> 02:34:30.997]  I never endorsed Kevin McCarthy for House Speaker.
[02:34:31.358 --> 02:34:33.520]  I endorsed him only for re-election of his House seat.
[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:37.603]  That's a major revelation that no one understood until now.
[02:34:38.604 --> 02:34:44.109]  And why would you say that unless you might be actually thinking of running for House Speaker?
[02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:46.972]  So my hopes are up that Trump may be considering that.
[02:34:47.392 --> 02:34:52.945]   Now, number two, I said that, well, if that's the case, then you should run for House Speaker.
[02:34:52.985 --> 02:34:57.648]  And he said, that's a private conversation for another time between you and me.
[02:34:58.229 --> 02:34:58.869]  What does that mean?
[02:34:58.909 --> 02:35:00.350]  That's a very interesting revelation.
[02:35:00.750 --> 02:35:02.532]  I think he's really considering it.
[02:35:02.912 --> 02:35:05.614]  And maybe he's holding back till after the midterm elections.
[02:35:05.934 --> 02:35:07.655]  He's going to play his cards tight to the vest.
[02:35:07.915 --> 02:35:09.176]  We're going to win by a landslide.
[02:35:09.256 --> 02:35:11.778]  And then he's going to announce he's running for Speaker of the House.
[02:35:12.539 --> 02:35:17.682]  If his people look at it from a lot of angles and decide it's the right thing to do and it makes sense for him.
[02:35:17.962 --> 02:35:18.643]  And I think it would.
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:22.641]  Because he would lead the impeachment of Biden and he would be in the news every day.
[02:35:22.661 --> 02:35:26.683]  And then he could literally, he could do this in coordination with Kevin McCarthy.
[02:35:26.743 --> 02:35:28.344]  Personally, I can't stand Kevin McCarthy.
[02:35:28.604 --> 02:35:29.905]  Personally, I think he's the wrong guy.
[02:35:30.185 --> 02:35:32.426]  He's not a real conservative and he stabbed Trump in the back.
[02:35:32.706 --> 02:35:37.268]  We've got video, excuse me, audio of him saying terrible things about Trump after January 6th.
[02:35:37.888 --> 02:35:54.771]  Having said that, if that's the issue, that Kevin McCarthy has to be friends with Trump, we gotta be partners, we can't move forward without his side of the establishment, then Trump's Speaker of the House, and he agrees to step down after, as soon as the impeachment hearings are over, and maybe at that point he's third in line, he becomes President of the United States!
[02:35:55.111 --> 02:35:58.892]  So Kevin McCarthy can have his Speakership back, if that's the only way to make this happen.
[02:35:59.152 --> 02:36:03.873]  But anyway, I'm an idea guy, and I throw ideas out, and what works, some work, some don't.
[02:36:04.253 --> 02:36:09.678]  But it was a great idea, and Trump's obviously, clearly, still thinking about it, or he wouldn't have given that answer.
[02:36:10.579 --> 02:36:11.000]  Number one.
[02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:13.042]  Number two, I brought up Bill Barr.
[02:36:13.682 --> 02:36:15.704]  Actually, I think Trump brought up Bill Barr, excuse me.
[02:36:16.225 --> 02:36:18.147]  Trump, in the interview, brought up Bill Barr's name.
[02:36:18.927 --> 02:36:23.612]  And I said, because we were talking about the January 6th witch hunt, the congressional witch hunt.
[02:36:24.250 --> 02:36:26.430]  And Trump mentioned Bill Barr, what a loser he is.
[02:36:26.470 --> 02:36:29.071]  And I said, listen, you know I love you.
[02:36:29.411 --> 02:36:30.511]  You know I think you're great.
[02:36:30.891 --> 02:36:32.812]  But man, that was a lousy pick.
[02:36:32.832 --> 02:36:34.952]  That was a bad pick for the first day.
[02:36:34.972 --> 02:36:36.092]  That guy's a rhino.
[02:36:36.392 --> 02:36:37.252]  He's a bushy.
[02:36:37.533 --> 02:36:38.713]  You never should have picked him.
[02:36:39.353 --> 02:36:41.213]  And shockingly, Trump said, you're right.
[02:36:41.533 --> 02:36:42.493]  He is a bad guy.
[02:36:42.794 --> 02:36:43.554]  He is a rhino.
[02:36:43.634 --> 02:36:44.694]  It was a big mistake.
[02:36:45.094 --> 02:36:46.094]  And it wasn't mine.
[02:36:46.474 --> 02:36:49.355]  It was on advice from someone I trusted.
[02:36:49.835 --> 02:36:53.329]   That's the Summary of what Trump had to say.
[02:36:53.369 --> 02:36:55.592]  Again, I'm paraphrasing from memory.
[02:36:55.632 --> 02:37:02.220]  I don't have the exact words in front of me, but almost word for word, he blamed it on someone he trusted that recommended Bill Barr.
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:05.624]  And I said, I knew from day one, he was a rhino and no good.
[02:37:05.664 --> 02:37:06.045]  There he is.
[02:37:06.345 --> 02:37:07.206]  He is no good.
[02:37:08.007 --> 02:37:10.030]  And everything he says about the election is a lie.
[02:37:11.491 --> 02:37:12.831]  So I thought that was groundbreaking.
[02:37:12.852 --> 02:37:14.212]  Number three, I didn't bring it up.
[02:37:14.312 --> 02:37:19.554]  He brought up, in the course of the conversation about January 6th and the witch hunt, Ashley Babbitt.
[02:37:20.054 --> 02:37:29.037]  That's the Air Force veteran gal who was killed by a police officer, just literally unarmed and not threatening any violence, doing nothing wrong.
[02:37:29.397 --> 02:37:34.419]  She was shot and killed going through a window that was already broken, along with hundreds of other people.
[02:37:34.839 --> 02:37:35.779]  And he shot her dead.
[02:37:35.799 --> 02:37:36.820]  You know what you call that?
[02:37:36.980 --> 02:37:37.260]  Murder.
[02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:48.092]  Well, Trump didn't use the word murder, but he came as close as any person in the world could come to saying she was murdered by that Capitol Police officer.
[02:37:48.452 --> 02:37:50.194]  Again, it's an opinion show.
[02:37:50.514 --> 02:37:51.355]  It's my opinion.
[02:37:51.375 --> 02:37:52.777]  Trump has an opinion.
[02:37:53.097 --> 02:37:54.879]  We all believe it was very bad.
[02:37:55.220 --> 02:37:56.021]  It looked horrible.
[02:37:56.361 --> 02:37:57.983]  Again, you get a trial in life.
[02:37:58.403 --> 02:38:03.004]  So he should get a trial, he should be indicted for murder, or manslaughter.
[02:38:03.284 --> 02:38:06.045]  There should be a trial and then we'd find out if he's guilty or not.
[02:38:06.325 --> 02:38:09.306]  And Trump said how outrageous that they covered that up.
[02:38:09.746 --> 02:38:14.708]  It was so clear that she was shot down in cold blood and nobody did anything about it.
[02:38:15.128 --> 02:38:22.870]  I was shocked that Trump was basically, for all intents and purposes, saying what I know and you know, she was murdered by a police officer.
[02:38:22.890 --> 02:38:23.670]  You know what's ironic?
[02:38:24.090 --> 02:38:33.019]   All over America, every time a black criminal See, if a black kid is killed by a cop, a white cop or otherwise, I'm as outraged as the rest of everybody else.
[02:38:33.459 --> 02:38:37.444]  You have no right to kill someone who doesn't deserve, who isn't pointing a gun at you and isn't shooting.
[02:38:37.725 --> 02:38:38.566]  That's a terrible thing!
[02:38:39.918 --> 02:38:43.979]  But how about when a white gal is shot by a black Capitol Police officer?
[02:38:44.440 --> 02:38:45.480]  No investigation.
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:46.840]  No argument.
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:47.961]  No debate.
[02:38:48.341 --> 02:38:49.521]  Nobody wants to talk about it.
[02:38:49.761 --> 02:38:50.942]  The media doesn't want to cover it.
[02:38:51.282 --> 02:38:53.382]  Was that racist, perhaps?
[02:38:53.442 --> 02:38:54.603]  Does it go both ways?
[02:38:55.043 --> 02:38:57.664]  Is there not racism on both sides of the aisle?
[02:38:58.104 --> 02:39:00.945]  So, you know, Ashley Babbitt was shot down by a police officer.
[02:39:01.245 --> 02:39:01.985]  She happened to be white.
[02:39:02.025 --> 02:39:02.746]  He happened to be black.
[02:39:03.026 --> 02:39:04.006]  No one said a word about that.
[02:39:04.833 --> 02:39:16.562]  But when a black kid gets shot by a white police officer, even if he's threatening the white police officer, the whole nation burns, rioting, looting, and murders, and attempted murder of police officers in every major city in America?
[02:39:16.942 --> 02:39:20.044]  Boy, talk about one-sided discussions in the media!
[02:39:20.425 --> 02:39:22.566]  In any case, forget about white or black.
[02:39:22.686 --> 02:39:24.888]  The important issue is Ashley Babbitt.
[02:39:25.448 --> 02:39:29.790]  was killed in a way that looks like murder or manslaughter.
[02:39:30.030 --> 02:39:34.112]  That looks like it was never necessary and that someone should go on trial for it.
[02:39:34.392 --> 02:39:34.953]  They never did.
[02:39:35.033 --> 02:39:36.173]  President Trump brought that up.
[02:39:37.554 --> 02:39:44.798]  I brought up the intentional destruction of the United States by the forces and the handlers behind Joe Biden.
[02:39:45.258 --> 02:39:46.398]  This is purposeful.
[02:39:46.718 --> 02:39:47.779]  This is intentional.
[02:39:48.059 --> 02:39:49.300]  This is not incompetence.
[02:39:49.620 --> 02:39:50.680]  This is not a mistake.
[02:39:51.081 --> 02:39:58.224]   President Trump in not so exact words Agreed with me that it was the intentional destruction of the United States.
[02:39:58.264 --> 02:40:11.669]  He said, look, he said, if you want to count intentional as the things they're doing, they know they're doing them and they're purposely doing them and they're killing America's middle class and they're making gas prices rise to the roof.
[02:40:12.049 --> 02:40:20.897]  And they're making the borders open and bringing in all kinds of criminals that will kill good, hard-working Americans and take their jobs and, you know, explode the national debt.
[02:40:21.337 --> 02:40:25.120]  Yes, Wayne, that it is intentional disruption, if you want to call it that.
[02:40:25.401 --> 02:40:31.346]  But it's still incompetence, he said, because how could you be so incompetent as to do such terrible things?
[02:40:31.386 --> 02:40:33.628]  And I said, because they're not incompetent!
[02:40:34.068 --> 02:40:39.112]  This is the intentional destruction and purposeful destruction of the United States.
[02:40:39.552 --> 02:40:41.373]  I asked President Trump about 2024.
[02:40:42.374 --> 02:40:45.957]  I said, I don't believe we're going to make it to 2024.
[02:40:46.377 --> 02:40:48.499]  And President Trump could have said, no, no, you're wrong.
[02:40:48.559 --> 02:40:49.339]  Everything will be okay.
[02:40:49.599 --> 02:40:50.300]  This is America.
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:51.461]  No, that's not what he said.
[02:40:51.861 --> 02:40:53.942]  President Trump said, I agree with you.
[02:40:54.422 --> 02:41:00.284]  I think it's a very big question and a very big doubt whether we're gonna make it to 2024.
[02:41:00.604 --> 02:41:05.326]  That's an explosive answer by the former President of the United States.
[02:41:05.726 --> 02:41:08.047]  This is not Wayne Root, the talk show, saying it.
[02:41:08.367 --> 02:41:12.228]  This is the President of the United States agreeing with me that there is a huge question.
[02:41:12.248 --> 02:41:15.229]  He didn't say, like me, we're not gonna make it to 2024.
[02:41:15.549 --> 02:41:17.770]  But he said it is a huge question.
[02:41:17.790 --> 02:41:19.891]  Let's see, I actually wrote the quote down.
[02:41:21.218 --> 02:41:24.399]  It's a huge question whether we're gonna make it or not to 2024.
[02:41:24.459 --> 02:41:27.620]  He said, oh, and we asked about Biden.
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:30.741]  I asked him, is Biden ever gonna run against you in 2024?
[02:41:31.501 --> 02:41:33.762]  And President Trump said, I really doubt it.
[02:41:34.142 --> 02:41:36.343]  I don't believe Biden will ever run against me.
[02:41:36.663 --> 02:41:37.923]  I don't believe he'll ever run again.
[02:41:37.963 --> 02:41:41.024]  And I said, I don't think the Democrat Party will ever let him run again.
[02:41:42.084 --> 02:41:49.547]   And then Trump talked about his doubts that His doubt that we can make it to 2024.
[02:41:49.607 --> 02:41:50.948]  Big question, big doubt, he said.
[02:41:51.268 --> 02:41:52.669]  I believe those are the exact words.
[02:41:53.229 --> 02:41:59.193]  So, he said that's a much bigger question than anything we've talked about today.
[02:41:59.613 --> 02:42:02.975]  Will the country exist in its present form in 2024?
[02:42:03.215 --> 02:42:13.341]  And then he said more bad things have been done in the last year and a half than in the 25 worst years in the history of America added together.
[02:42:13.821 --> 02:42:29.146]  So Trump is equal with me questioning whether America will exist in its present form in 2024 or whether the country will collapse under the debt and under the crime and under the open borders and under all the disasters going on in this country.
[02:42:29.739 --> 02:42:30.820]  All right, welcome back to the show.
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:32.541]  Wayne Allyn Root, guest hosting for Alex Jones.
[02:42:33.001 --> 02:42:39.365]  Last segment, I hope you've enjoyed the revelations about my interview with President Donald Trump yesterday on my national radio show.
[02:42:39.785 --> 02:42:51.093]   By the way, not only are we both relaxed and you're listening to a conversation between two friends, but even more important than that, I get him because of that friendship more than any other host, I believe, in the United States of America.
[02:42:51.113 --> 02:42:53.715]  I don't think anybody's had Trump as often as I've gotten him.
[02:42:53.935 --> 02:42:57.297]  Four times in the last year, every three months, I've got Trump as my guest.
[02:42:57.337 --> 02:43:07.525]  So, I don't know that the Hannity's of the world, the Levin's of the world, I don't know that anybody has ever gotten Trump every three months like I do, but I'm very proud and honored that he loves to join me.
[02:43:08.647 --> 02:43:12.410]  Let's talk about the last two remaining points I have to make about this interview.
[02:43:12.911 --> 02:43:17.014]  First of all, we both agreed about the January 6th congressional hearing.
[02:43:17.415 --> 02:43:18.276]  It's a show trial!
[02:43:18.716 --> 02:43:23.440]  I said there's a communist attack on the United States, and you can see it all around you.
[02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:25.502]  Look at Peter Navarro, I said!
[02:43:25.962 --> 02:43:33.169]  You know, that was Trump's former top official and assistant to the President of the United States and head of all trade negotiations.
[02:43:33.489 --> 02:43:37.593]  Peter Navarro went to China and negotiated the trade deal with China.
[02:43:37.933 --> 02:43:43.599]  You know, there's no one more important American business in the whole country than the President of the United States and Peter Navarro.
[02:43:44.059 --> 02:43:48.724]  And they arrested him in handcuffs and leg shackles and stuck him in a prison cell.
[02:43:49.325 --> 02:43:53.056]  This is beyond anything that's ever happened in the history of America!
[02:43:53.096 --> 02:43:54.239]  This is Russia!
[02:43:54.480 --> 02:43:55.443]  This is Nazi!
[02:43:55.664 --> 02:43:56.927]  This is Communist China!
[02:43:57.754 --> 02:43:59.815]  And I said to Trump, who's next?
[02:44:00.255 --> 02:44:02.517]  First they took Peter Navarro, who's next?
[02:44:02.617 --> 02:44:02.877]  You?
[02:44:03.237 --> 02:44:05.999]  Are they going to take you in shackles from Mar-a-Lago?
[02:44:06.639 --> 02:44:16.285]  And so, you know, again, you'll have to listen to the interview, but Trump said, you know, all of this is part and parcel of a show trial, or I said a communist show trial.
[02:44:16.585 --> 02:44:20.187]  He actually said his exact words were a witch hunt and a kangaroo court.
[02:44:21.517 --> 02:44:24.799]  And he mentioned how there's nobody on his side on the panel!
[02:44:25.299 --> 02:44:32.183]  It's like having a trial for murder and the prosecution is able to make their case and on the other side is nobody!
[02:44:32.853 --> 02:44:34.614]  There's no defense attorney on the other side.
[02:44:34.974 --> 02:44:39.136]  There isn't one Republican congressman on the committee that cares about Trump.
[02:44:39.516 --> 02:44:41.276]  There's only two Republicans on the committee.
[02:44:41.697 --> 02:44:57.103]  Everyone else, the Democrat and the two Republicans, are Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who both hate Trump with such a passion that I'm guessing, again, an opinion show, and it's my opinion, those two are members, card-carrying members, of the Communist Party of China.
[02:44:57.563 --> 02:45:02.267]  Those two are so out to get Trump, they would lynch him on a tree if they could.
[02:45:02.647 --> 02:45:07.270]  They're like taking orders from the Communist Party of China, the CCP.
[02:45:07.731 --> 02:45:08.471]  What an outrage.
[02:45:08.611 --> 02:45:17.678]  Again, my opinion, opinion show, they exhibit everything about them makes them sound like they are owned by the deep state, the DC swamp.
[02:45:18.058 --> 02:45:23.582]  George Soros, Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum, and don't forget the Chinese Communist Party.
[02:45:23.922 --> 02:45:28.326]  Everything these people do is to hurt Trump and make sure he can never be president again.
[02:45:28.706 --> 02:45:33.649]  For those of you who doubt that Trump should be president, you're mad at him over the vaccines, as an example.
[02:45:33.890 --> 02:45:38.213]  And I get it, I've always said to Trump, there's only one thing in the world I'd disagree with you on, the vaccines.
[02:45:38.533 --> 02:45:43.217]  The vaccines are horrible, they're terrible, they're injuring people, they're killing people, and you think they're great.
[02:45:43.277 --> 02:45:44.498]  Well, you and I disagree on that.
[02:45:44.758 --> 02:45:45.258]  But that's it.
[02:45:45.619 --> 02:45:50.943]  On everything else in the world and the economy, and foreign affairs and national defense, we're in agreement.
[02:45:51.243 --> 02:45:52.765]  He did a great job on everything.
[02:45:53.125 --> 02:45:55.166]  And even on that one, he did a great job.
[02:45:55.467 --> 02:45:56.808]  He didn't invent the vaccines.
[02:45:57.088 --> 02:45:58.009]  That's not his job.
[02:45:58.269 --> 02:45:59.110]  He's not a scientist.
[02:45:59.130 --> 02:46:00.211]  He's not Dr. Fauci.
[02:46:00.451 --> 02:46:01.692]  He's not head of the CDC.
[02:46:01.972 --> 02:46:08.097]  He simply was a field general who made sure the vaccines were created in record time that no one thought possible.
[02:46:08.397 --> 02:46:10.099]  So we could all get back to business.
[02:46:10.459 --> 02:46:22.970]  He didn't know there was an evil Dr. Evil in the background creating a death vax that would kill and injure so many people under the guise of protecting you from a flu that had a 99.95% chance of you being healthy in three or four days.
[02:46:27.159 --> 02:46:28.399]  Nobody ever needed the vaccine.
[02:46:28.740 --> 02:46:31.260]  They needed Ivermectin, they needed Hydroxchloroquine.
[02:46:31.300 --> 02:46:33.321]  Again, it's an opinion show, it's my opinion.
[02:46:33.661 --> 02:46:38.062]  Studies prove Ivermectin and Hydroxchloroquine kill COVID quickly.
[02:46:38.443 --> 02:46:39.383]  But let's not say kill.
[02:46:39.643 --> 02:46:41.844]  They're very effective against COVID.
[02:46:42.104 --> 02:46:44.424]  The most effective drugs we've ever seen against COVID.
[02:46:44.704 --> 02:46:46.065]  Throw in vitamin C, vitamin D.
[02:46:47.250 --> 02:46:57.455]  Zinc and quercetin, and you got an incredible formula for everyone to use, and they never needed the vaccine to take that incredible risk of death that that vaccine's giving you.
[02:46:57.975 --> 02:47:00.957]  And so, he believes the kangaroo court January 6th.
[02:47:00.977 --> 02:47:01.877]  He believes the witch hunt.
[02:47:02.257 --> 02:47:03.158]  I believe the same thing.
[02:47:03.518 --> 02:47:05.679]  I added that there's a communist takeover of the United States.
[02:47:05.979 --> 02:47:09.504]  And that's why I call this a show trial like you'd see in a communist country.
[02:47:09.804 --> 02:47:13.709]  I also mentioned Saul Alinsky in my interview with Trump, and he said, yes, yes!
[02:47:14.089 --> 02:47:21.919]   I said, Saul Alinsky wrote Rules for Radicals, and Rules for Radicals said, look in the mirror, And whatever you see, blame the other guy.
[02:47:21.959 --> 02:47:23.820]  Blame your opponent for what you're doing.
[02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:26.582]  And that's what they're doing with this show trial!
[02:47:27.102 --> 02:47:29.223]  They know they are the traitors!
[02:47:29.644 --> 02:47:33.766]  They know they've already... What do they call the January 6th?
[02:47:33.806 --> 02:47:35.647]  They called it an insurrection.
[02:47:36.068 --> 02:47:37.709]  They committed the insurrection!
[02:47:38.009 --> 02:47:40.350]  The insurrection was the stolen election!
[02:47:40.771 --> 02:47:44.113]  They stole the election and they stole our country!
[02:47:44.413 --> 02:47:46.715]  It was a coup and an insurrection!
[02:47:47.095 --> 02:47:52.617]   So they made January 6th A peaceful protest looked like a coup and an insurrection.
[02:47:52.937 --> 02:47:55.437]  Now they're charging it's a coup and an insurrection.
[02:47:55.997 --> 02:48:03.619]  And the greatest lawyer in the history of the world, Alan Dershowitz, who's a regular guest on my show, just said the other day, go ahead and try Trump on all those charges.
[02:48:03.859 --> 02:48:06.099]  There's not one thing he did that is a crime.
[02:48:06.199 --> 02:48:06.679]  Not one.
[02:48:06.959 --> 02:48:08.440]  There's nothing you could get him on.
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:18.516]   And finally, the last observation I'll make about my Trump interview is if you listen to it, He sounds more deflated than usual.
[02:48:18.896 --> 02:48:20.418]  I won't use the word depressed.
[02:48:20.798 --> 02:48:22.280]  I'll use the word deflated.
[02:48:22.820 --> 02:48:27.765]  And I'm just reading into this because President Trump, you know, you and I didn't have a private conversation off the air.
[02:48:28.065 --> 02:48:29.006]  I have no idea if it's true.
[02:48:29.046 --> 02:48:29.746]  It's my opinion.
[02:48:30.027 --> 02:48:31.288]  And I'm an opinion commentator.
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:40.524]  I believe that President Trump is deflated as I am, as enthusiastic and high energy and positive as I am my whole life.
[02:48:41.084 --> 02:48:49.287]  I'm deflated right now because I see my country being destroyed in front of me at a record speed the likes of which no one has ever seen.
[02:48:49.307 --> 02:48:57.731]   Remember I wrote the Biden Blitzkrieg because I compared the speed at which he's destroying America to the Nazi Blitzkrieg That took over Europe.
[02:48:57.811 --> 02:48:59.173]  I didn't compare it to the Holocaust.
[02:48:59.533 --> 02:49:03.518]  Don't send any organizations after me to say I'm comparing it to the Holocaust.
[02:49:03.878 --> 02:49:09.184]  I'm comparing it to the speed at which Hitler's Nazi army took over Europe.
[02:49:09.485 --> 02:49:14.751]  There is an absolute comparison to be made for the speed of the destruction of America right now.
[02:49:15.231 --> 02:49:21.837]  And Trump sees what I see, again, my opinion, and he's deflated because it never should have happened.
[02:49:22.257 --> 02:49:23.418]  He was the president.
[02:49:23.478 --> 02:49:24.559]  He was re-elected.
[02:49:24.839 --> 02:49:32.726]  They stole the election from him and therefore stole not only his place in history, but his chance to make America truly great again.
[02:49:33.086 --> 02:49:35.208]  And they're making America poor again.
[02:49:35.448 --> 02:49:35.829]  MAPPA!
[02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:39.532]  The Democrat Party is making America poor again!
[02:49:39.872 --> 02:49:42.094]  They're making us into the poorest country in the world!
[02:49:42.394 --> 02:49:44.135]  What did Trump call all those other countries?
[02:49:44.636 --> 02:49:45.456]  Crap holes!
[02:49:45.616 --> 02:49:46.477]  I'm saying it nicely.
[02:49:46.697 --> 02:49:47.558]  He used a different word.
[02:49:47.898 --> 02:49:49.059]  With an S-H at the start.
[02:49:49.299 --> 02:49:50.660]  But let's call them crap holes.
[02:49:51.080 --> 02:49:52.962]  Central America filled with crap holes.
[02:49:53.322 --> 02:49:55.344]  Mexico, nice people, but crap hole.
[02:49:55.664 --> 02:49:57.065]  Haiti, crap hole.
[02:49:57.345 --> 02:49:58.586]  These countries are crap holes.
[02:49:58.606 --> 02:50:00.007]  Zimbabwe is a crap hole.
[02:50:00.548 --> 02:50:02.589]  Almost every nation in Africa is a crap hole.
[02:50:02.869 --> 02:50:04.811]  America is the greatest nation in the world!
[02:50:05.151 --> 02:50:06.933]  People live such great lives here.
[02:50:07.313 --> 02:50:22.026]  They're trying to drag us down and turn us into one of those crap holes, ironically, that all those people from those countries are running away from to come to America and they're willing to break in illegally because it's so great here and the streets are paved with gold.
[02:50:22.307 --> 02:50:24.609]  They're trying to make us into those crap holes.
[02:50:25.129 --> 02:50:33.811]  So Trump is seeing that like I am, and he is deflated that someone's got to do something, yet legally there's almost nothing we can do other than vote.
[02:50:34.211 --> 02:50:35.772]  And voting isn't going to cut it.
[02:50:36.232 --> 02:50:37.992]  Voting alone isn't going to save us.
[02:50:38.313 --> 02:50:44.414]  We're not going to make it to 2024 just because we win an election in 2022 November.
[02:50:44.914 --> 02:50:51.296]  And by the way, there's no guarantee we're going to win in a landslide in November either, because they rig elections.
[02:50:52.543 --> 02:51:04.309]  So, all I can tell you is I believe from that interview that my friend Donald J. Trump was deflated and is deflated just as I am deflated after you see my excitement and my high energy and all that other stuff.
[02:51:04.769 --> 02:51:06.330]  I must tell you, I am deflated!
[02:51:07.043 --> 02:51:08.404]  What are we gonna do?
[02:51:09.044 --> 02:51:14.408]  The only answer I have at this point is to vote, and to vote them out, and to win at a gigantic landslide.
[02:51:14.728 --> 02:51:18.671]  And the only other answer I've got, which I've said on this show, is we need a divorce.
[02:51:19.091 --> 02:51:20.512]  Divorce American style.
[02:51:20.532 --> 02:51:23.594]  Remember that famous movie, TV series in the 70s?
[02:51:23.934 --> 02:51:25.035]  Marriage American style?
[02:51:25.736 --> 02:51:26.716]  Or love American style.
[02:51:26.956 --> 02:51:28.758]  This is divorce American style.
[02:51:29.118 --> 02:51:30.739]  Blue states have got to go their own way.
[02:51:31.139 --> 02:51:34.520]  Separate and red states have to go their own way separate.
[02:51:34.761 --> 02:51:36.981]  And we got to get away from these crazy people.
[02:51:37.281 --> 02:51:38.742]  They're suicide bombers.
[02:51:39.062 --> 02:51:40.303]  They're kamikazes.
[02:51:40.603 --> 02:51:42.183]  They're domestic terrorists.
[02:51:42.323 --> 02:51:43.784]  Again, Solinsky.
[02:51:44.264 --> 02:51:46.165]  Democrats are the domestic terrorists.
[02:51:46.505 --> 02:51:49.126]  And they accuse us of being domestic terrorists.
[02:51:49.426 --> 02:51:52.427]  They burned the country down with BLM and Antifa.
[02:51:52.767 --> 02:51:54.968]  They destroyed $2 billion in property.
[02:51:55.268 --> 02:51:56.268]  They killed policemen.
[02:51:56.508 --> 02:51:58.369]  They tried to murder thousands of policemen.
[02:51:58.649 --> 02:52:00.030]  They killed many, many people.
[02:52:00.330 --> 02:52:02.110]  Murder rate was up dramatically in 2020.
[02:52:02.811 --> 02:52:07.292]  And yet they accuse us of being domestic terrorists because we don't want to take a vaccine.
[02:52:07.852 --> 02:52:11.533]  Because we don't like critical race theory and we go to PTA meetings and complain about it.
[02:52:11.794 --> 02:52:12.954]  We're domestic terrorists!
[02:52:13.414 --> 02:52:14.976]  You see it's Saul Alinsky!
[02:52:15.276 --> 02:52:18.940]  Look in the mirror and blame the other guy for everything you're really doing.
[02:52:19.221 --> 02:52:20.542]  That was Russian collusion!
[02:52:20.903 --> 02:52:22.705]  They're the ones that tried to steal the election!
[02:52:23.005 --> 02:52:24.387]  They're the ones that rigged the election!
[02:52:24.667 --> 02:52:27.210]  They're the ones that spied on Trump like communists!
[02:52:27.650 --> 02:52:30.053]  And yet they accused us of Russian collusion.
[02:52:30.413 --> 02:52:32.295]  It's all Saul Alinsky rules for radicals.
[02:52:32.555 --> 02:52:34.697]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root saying goodbye for this week.
[02:52:35.077 --> 02:52:36.879]  Rootforamerica.com is my website.
[02:52:37.199 --> 02:52:39.881]  WayneRootatgmail.com is my email.
[02:52:40.141 --> 02:52:42.964]  My book is the Great Patriot Protest and Boycott book.
[02:52:43.004 --> 02:52:43.344]  Here it is.
[02:52:43.664 --> 02:52:46.386]  Great Patriot Protest and Boycott book by Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:52:46.587 --> 02:52:47.667]  Have yourselves a great day.
[02:52:48.008 --> 02:52:50.350]  We gotta fight and we gotta come up with some answers fast.
[02:52:50.890 --> 02:52:52.351]  Hope you enjoyed my interview with President Trump.
[02:52:52.692 --> 02:52:53.012]  Bye-bye.
[02:52:53.873 --> 02:52:55.274]  This is an attack on the world economy.
[02:52:55.634 --> 02:52:59.161]   That's the prime result we get out of this.
[02:52:59.181 --> 02:52:59.887]  We're gonna face.
[02:53:01.440 --> 02:53:03.481]  Economic problems that come from this and uncertainty.
[02:53:03.501 --> 02:53:05.262]  We're going to face military crises.
[02:53:05.302 --> 02:53:07.963]  We're going to face cultural and spiritual crises.
[02:53:07.983 --> 02:53:15.367]  And we're going to see the UN further throw third world populations at borders of the West and attempt to break the West.
[02:53:15.907 --> 02:53:17.968]  Suddenly, the world's going bankrupt.
[02:53:18.028 --> 02:53:19.468]  Suddenly, your savings are gone.
[02:53:19.669 --> 02:53:25.331]  The New World Order elite types are going to try to trigger a financial collapse.
[02:53:26.172 --> 02:53:28.073]  This is the mass culling.
[02:53:28.313 --> 02:53:30.674]  When the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[02:53:31.676 --> 02:53:54.550]  I could play you clip after clip for hours of going back 30 months ago, and 20 months ago, and 10 months ago, and a month ago, where I told you there'd be hyperinflation, I told you there'd be food shortages, I told you the price of food would explode, because it's an IMF, World Bank, globalist plan they've already carried out for decades in third world countries, and now they're doing it.
[02:53:55.143 --> 02:53:58.766]  Dire new report forces US UK to change course on coronavirus strategy.
[02:53:59.086 --> 02:54:01.228]  Now you're going to be locked up for 18 months.
[02:54:01.909 --> 02:54:01.969]  Oh!
[02:54:03.359 --> 02:54:05.960]  That's gonna cause a depression within a month of this crap.
[02:54:06.360 --> 02:54:07.200]  But that's okay.
[02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:12.181]  Now the depression isn't the banker's fault or the politicians, it's all the virus.
[02:54:12.521 --> 02:54:15.381]  So now they can really screw you over.
[02:54:15.662 --> 02:54:26.284]  This has been the plan stated to cut off your carbon, to cut off your life, to cut off your mobility, to absolutely bring you down to below a third world status.
[02:54:26.644 --> 02:54:42.899]   And when you de-industrialize and you collapse the first world, just the estimates Put out by Russia and the United States, and Lord Monkton has his own, that if they did a 50% carbon cut like they wanted by 2025, they wanted the deal in place by 2008, didn't happen.
[02:54:45.538 --> 02:54:49.281]  That over a billion people would starve to death in the first decade.
[02:54:49.621 --> 02:54:53.244]  That's a b-b-b-b-b-b-billion!
[02:54:53.424 --> 02:55:02.452]  They've got a whole societal collapse program, how it brings down the hospitals and brings down the civilization, then there's a collapse, and then the general masses are starving to death.
[02:55:03.132 --> 02:55:12.341]  And so those that still have wealth that aren't part of the system are told, you've got to sign on and put your wealth into this to stabilize and save all these people that are dying and starving.
[02:55:12.961 --> 02:55:18.706]  And then basically you sign your wealth over to this big giant global wallet that they're going to be rolling out.
[02:55:19.247 --> 02:55:22.570]  And you and your whole family are in extreme danger of being murdered.
[02:55:23.090 --> 02:55:23.651]  Extreme danger.
[02:55:24.332 --> 02:55:27.540]   And It's not just from the virus they're going to release.
[02:55:28.221 --> 02:55:33.924]  It's from the collapse of civilization that's going to ensue that they're then going to organize to consolidate power.
[02:55:34.685 --> 02:55:52.037]  The only way to beat these people is to understand their game plan and to understand they've just started their inflationary system and to use the dollars you've got today to buy high quality storable food and other preparedness and survival items at low prices so that in the future you have what you need.
[02:55:52.357 --> 02:55:54.599]  That's how you beat these people.
[02:55:55.159 --> 02:55:55.659]   Now, No.
[02:55:55.759 --> 02:56:01.664]  We have hundreds of great items at Storable Food and InfoRestore.com, but it gets confusing because there's so many other thousands of items.
[02:56:02.125 --> 02:56:06.388]  That's why, with our great partners, we have created PrepareToday.com.
