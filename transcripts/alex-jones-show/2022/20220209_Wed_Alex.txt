[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:03.572]  Must watch Wednesday broadcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:04.393 --> 00:00:10.419]  Pfizer warns shareholders to brace for unfavorable clinical safety data.
[00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:18.187]  Meanwhile, the CDC has announced that it's set to release new guidance saying don't take shots too close.
[00:00:18.627 --> 00:00:23.918]   Together they can cause blood clots or heart attacks, myocarditis, and Death.
[00:00:24.298 --> 00:00:31.298]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:38.298]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live.
[00:00:38.383 --> 00:00:42.085]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:46.984]  [music]
[00:00:46.984 --> 00:00:50.984]   Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is a parent.
[00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:54.984]  [music]
[00:00:54.984 --> 00:00:56.984]  [laughter]
[00:00:56.984 --> 00:00:57.984]  Alex Jones.
[00:00:58.742 --> 00:00:59.783]  Scum!
[00:01:00.103 --> 00:01:03.226]  Russian scum!
[00:01:03.246 --> 00:01:08.311]  The Dolores comes to mind.
[00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:14.216]  Your reputation's amazing.
[00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:15.978]  I will not let you down.
[00:01:15.957 --> 00:01:19.316]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:01:19.316 --> 00:01:37.516]  Thank you.
[00:01:37.516 --> 00:01:40.097]  (upbeat music)
[00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:46.618]  So far, the RCMP has mobilized nearly 300 officers to support the Ottawa Police Services and is ready to do more.
[00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:52.603]  Rather than face the Canadian people, Justin Trudeau is siccing his police on them.
[00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.102]  Governments have been hiring globalist players and thugs for years.
[00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:02.145]  Meet Peter Slowly, known for being woke.
[00:02:03.086 --> 00:02:17.777]  Seven years ago, as Deputy Police Chief, Peter Slowly said that being black made him a suitable candidate for Toronto's next police chief, and claimed a more important factor was his experience as a United Nations peacekeeper.
[00:02:18.477 --> 00:02:24.081]  An international police force known for raping and pillaging communities under the flag of peace.
[00:02:25.122 --> 00:02:31.666]  It was reported that there was much animosity when Slowly was not chosen to be Toronto's first black police chief.
[00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:34.088]  And a year later, he resigned.
[00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:55.793]  During his resignation speech, he bragged about tempting offers coming from the international private sector, and went on immediately to join the company Deloitte, whose CEO sits on the board of directors at Pfizer, and who was awarded over $40 million by the CDC to build a vaccine management system.
[00:02:57.233 --> 00:03:03.555]  A couple months before the COVID-19 scandemic, Peter Sloly was made chief of the Ottawa police.
[00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:14.814]  While the world celebrates the inspiring human spirit coming from the people of Canada, their own police steal their gasoline to freeze them out.
[00:03:16.035 --> 00:03:17.796]  Families and children.
[00:03:19.316 --> 00:03:23.478]  And the foundations of an incoming false flag are now being identified.
[00:03:24.218 --> 00:03:31.982]  Meet Peter Downing, a former cop for the RCMP who was given full pay and a clean record after a criminal conviction.
[00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:45.585]   Downing is the head of Wexit, An Alberta separatist movement seeking to overrule Canadian law with decrees set by the United Nations and funded by a woman who sits on the board of the Atlantic Council.
[00:03:46.165 --> 00:03:50.566]  The Atlantic Council founded CrowdStrike, which ties them to Hillary Clinton.
[00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:54.947]  They are funded by George Soros and the Ukraine's Burisma.
[00:03:55.667 --> 00:04:02.288]  They are considered a threat to constitutional order by the Russian government and they fund Peter Downing's Wexit.
[00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:11.094]  Wexit has made itself a part of the Ottawa protests, and their connections to George Soros and the RCMP should be cause for alarm.
[00:04:11.815 --> 00:04:15.177]  People need to be on the lookout for state-sponsored shenanigans.
[00:04:15.478 --> 00:04:41.678]   We've been told that one of the triggers or indicators where we know that they are going to physically move against us and start arresting us Is when our media goes down, when all of our telecommunications devices do go down, when we go fully black, the next phase of this will be the public order units will move in on us and start kettling.
[00:04:42.898 --> 00:04:43.399]  This is it.
[00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:57.748]   If there's a media blackout of everybody that you're connected to with this freedom convoy, That's your trigger that you know something is up, and I would encourage you to make arrangements and immediately start heading to Ottawa.
[00:04:58.628 --> 00:05:16.496]  Trudeau's liberals are now scurrying to pass their new anti-hate laws, straight out of communist China, where a Canadian can be fined $70,000 and thrown in jail for up to four years for the crime of posting anything on the internet that the government deems inappropriate.
[00:05:17.756 --> 00:05:21.756]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:21.756 --> 00:05:33.756]  [Music]
[00:05:33.756 --> 00:05:41.756]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this February 9th, 2022 Wednesday edition.
[00:05:41.756 --> 00:05:51.756]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:45.302 --> 00:05:53.648]  I normally get ready for about four hours in the morning, but today I had a lot of family stuff going on and some very important business developments to fund the operation that were very positive.
[00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.693]  And I only spent about an hour today reading news and getting ready.
[00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:04.837]  So I got in here late and I was going over the 500 articles or so they'd printed off for me.
[00:06:05.757 --> 00:06:07.218]  And I only got through two of the stacks.
[00:06:07.258 --> 00:06:08.299]  Normally I go through everything.
[00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:09.200]  I didn't go through it today.
[00:06:11.042 --> 00:06:15.505]  Just the two stacks I went through have chills shooting up and down my spine right now.
[00:06:17.546 --> 00:06:18.186]  Whoa!
[00:06:18.206 --> 00:06:23.929]  I mean, wow!
[00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.471]  Look at just the top two stories.
[00:06:27.491 --> 00:06:32.874]  Pfizer quietly yesterday.
[00:06:35.356 --> 00:06:45.621]  released an email to their shareholders warning them of bad clinical trial news coming out that they believe is going to hurt the forced injection program.
[00:06:47.703 --> 00:06:51.965]  Now we already knew they suppressed the bad clinical data, which is a huge felony crime.
[00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:54.026]  We have the whistleblowers, the documents.
[00:06:54.046 --> 00:06:59.769]  We already know that the British Medical Journal four months ago came out and said this is one of the greatest crimes ever.
[00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:02.470]  You will discredit vaccines for generations.
[00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.751]  You need to pull it.
[00:07:05.293 --> 00:07:06.574]  But did you ever see that on the news?
[00:07:07.254 --> 00:07:10.277]  You try to share that on Instagram or Twitter, your ass is banned.
[00:07:12.278 --> 00:07:16.501]  Think of the people that work at Twitter and Facebook committing those crimes to cover that out.
[00:07:17.662 --> 00:07:18.442]  To black that out.
[00:07:19.983 --> 00:07:23.806]  That's why you see all these folks abandoning ship over there at Facebook, and they should be.
[00:07:25.347 --> 00:07:28.830]  Because if you stay part of this now, folks, you are definitely guilty.
[00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.112]  Maybe you didn't know before if you were an executive at Facebook or Twitter.
[00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:33.213]  You do now.
[00:07:34.093 --> 00:07:45.506]   People over at Google, And they're just doubling down with the cover-ups, but not Pfizer, because in their corporate religion of evil, they've got to tell the owners what's really happening.
[00:07:46.287 --> 00:08:12.907]   They just made their 90-plus billion dollars the last year of nightmare-force medical tyranny, and now they release, you can read the whole thing on InfoWars.com, that's hard news, directly to their shareholders saying, quote, Pfizer quietly adds language warning that unfavorable preclinical, clinical or safety data may impact business.
[00:08:14.187 --> 00:08:15.168]  Boy, that's a mouthful.
[00:08:15.188 --> 00:08:15.968]  Let me read that to you again.
[00:08:15.988 --> 00:08:27.334]  Pfizer quietly adds language warning that unfavorable preclinical or clinical or safety data may impact business.
[00:08:27.534 --> 00:08:31.956]  Oh, you mean because for the last year you've been trying to suppress since day one?
[00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:46.985]  The clinical data in the UK, going back 18 months ago, and the clinical data here, going back 13 months ago, and there's all these hundreds of lawsuits in two different federal courts, and then the appellate court have ordered them to release the documents and they said no!
[00:08:50.147 --> 00:08:52.548]  And the court said release 500 pages.
[00:08:54.228 --> 00:08:57.630]  The 500 pages were the first couple weeks in the US alone.
[00:08:59.042 --> 00:09:04.047]  Couple thousand deaths directly confirmed, not in VAERS, by the doctors, by Pfizer.
[00:09:05.408 --> 00:09:08.371]  Tens of thousands of miscarriages, tens of thousands of heart attacks.
[00:09:09.912 --> 00:09:11.294]  And that's what got put on record.
[00:09:11.694 --> 00:09:14.777]  Even Harvard estimates 1% end up getting properly reported.
[00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:18.400]  Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:09:19.121 --> 00:09:49.342]   So the CDC knew In October of 2020, months before anybody got injected in the U.S., that it's going to cause blood clots, heart attacks, myocarditis, because the top virologist, and the top epidemiologist, and the top vaccine experts in the world said, we've tried the spike protein before in rat studies, and guinea pig studies, and mice studies, and primate studies, and it kills the majority of them with blood clots and heart attacks and cancer very quickly.
[00:09:52.213 --> 00:09:53.193]  Now, humans are tough.
[00:09:54.154 --> 00:09:56.054]  We can take on a lot more poison than most animals.
[00:09:56.114 --> 00:09:58.415]  That's the little secret about us, is we're pretty badass.
[00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:04.698]  But, we are being hit and hit incredibly hard, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:06.678 --> 00:10:07.739]  And they all think it's funny.
[00:10:08.479 --> 00:10:10.740]  These psycho, death cult murderers.
[00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:14.421]  I mean, there's a reason the New Zealand Prime Minister looks like a psychotic vampire.
[00:10:14.941 --> 00:10:19.203]  She's a Davos graduate and literally wants humanity population she admits publicly.
[00:10:19.938 --> 00:10:23.280]  So she wants you to die, but she wants you to live, take this shot.
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.561]  Not very hard to figure out what's happening.
[00:10:25.581 --> 00:10:34.565]  It's like if somebody is a convicted child molester, and they tell you they want to come do drag queen story time with your elementary students, and you let them, you're now aiding and abetting.
[00:10:34.725 --> 00:10:42.269]  Because obviously someone who's convicted child molester is dressing up like a clown to come see children because they want to molest them.
[00:10:43.126 --> 00:10:54.590]  Well, when someone like Bill Gates tells you he wants to depopulate the planet, and when she says she wants to depopulate the planet, and attends those events, and now she wants to lock you down and put something in your body, folks, it ain't 2 plus 2, it just is.
[00:10:56.671 --> 00:11:02.153]  It's not just putting 2 plus 2 together, it's just prima facie on its face.
[00:11:02.893 --> 00:11:04.154]  Now, that's just one of the articles.
[00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:12.733]  pretty massively bombshell.
[00:11:12.733 --> 00:11:15.293]  Here's one just as big.
[00:11:15.293 --> 00:11:25.292]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:11:16.727 --> 00:11:22.089]  CDC considers increasing time between vaccines to cut risk of heart inflammation, heart attacks, and death.
[00:11:22.429 --> 00:11:23.809]  They're saying this themselves.
[00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:27.351]  Boston Local 25 is reporting.
[00:11:27.671 --> 00:11:30.232]  And notice what the CDC and others are doing and Pfizer is.
[00:11:30.752 --> 00:11:32.152]  They're putting this out to their shareholders.
[00:11:32.172 --> 00:11:34.413]  They're putting it out real quietly on local TV stations.
[00:11:34.793 --> 00:11:39.495]  So it's a public notice of what they're doing to you, but they don't want to put it on the Joe Rogan Show.
[00:11:39.755 --> 00:11:42.536]  They want to say he's wrong when he tells 20 million people the truth.
[00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:51.288]  And under law, under British common law, which is the basis of our constitutional rights, if they give you a notice, though, they have less liability.
[00:11:51.548 --> 00:11:52.469]  So they notice it.
[00:11:54.569 --> 00:11:56.330]  Remember the first six months of the deadly injections?
[00:11:57.871 --> 00:12:03.253]  Nurses and doctors and pharmacy owners would open up the vaccine injection paperwork.
[00:12:03.273 --> 00:12:04.234]  The law was supposed to be in there.
[00:12:04.254 --> 00:12:04.714]  It was blank.
[00:12:06.036 --> 00:12:07.237]  As pure as the driven snow.
[00:12:07.517 --> 00:12:13.702]  Now, they finally added six months later, okay, cause heart attacks and heart swelling and some other things to cover their ass.
[00:12:13.722 --> 00:12:16.444]  In fact, all that's on the sheet is the horrible things it can do to you now.
[00:12:17.065 --> 00:12:18.946]  Not what's in it, because that's all secret.
[00:12:19.267 --> 00:12:23.250]  And Pfizer and Moderna, they all got a secret deal that Trump signed with them.
[00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:24.991]  One of Trump's biggest follies.
[00:12:25.011 --> 00:12:26.873]  One of Trump's biggest black marks.
[00:12:29.463 --> 00:12:31.164]  And now they have a secret agreement with the government?
[00:12:31.424 --> 00:12:32.665]  Congress can't even see that.
[00:12:32.965 --> 00:12:34.386]  Since when the hell does that go on?
[00:12:34.826 --> 00:12:39.189]  And all these other countries signed the secret agreement except Brazil didn't.
[00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:47.494]  And now the UN has a war crimes court open for crimes against humanity and are trying to get an indictment of Bolsonaro.
[00:12:48.995 --> 00:12:52.797]  Because he didn't let them rape the hell out of his people.
[00:12:54.158 --> 00:12:55.499]  Boy, I wish we had Bolsonaro.
[00:12:56.354 --> 00:13:01.076]  I mean, I think Trump's a good guy overall, but Bolsonaro is so much more smarter, so much stronger.
[00:13:02.937 --> 00:13:07.278]  We need a hundred Bolsonaro's as presidents around the world and prime ministers.
[00:13:08.179 --> 00:13:10.560]  We sure as hell don't need a hundred Joe Biden's.
[00:13:12.941 --> 00:13:25.886]  We need a billion Tucker Carlson's and a couple billion more Joe Rogan's and a couple billion more Naomi Wolf's and people like Tulsi Gabbard's.
[00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:31.452]  And you are the Joe Rogan or the Tulsi Gabbard out there.
[00:13:31.512 --> 00:13:32.974]  You are the Tucker Carlson.
[00:13:32.994 --> 00:13:33.994]  You are the Bolsonaro.
[00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:40.220]  Well, it got up to five African presidents.
[00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:46.705]  Most of them turned out were doctors, because in Africa they prize being a doctor over a lawyer.
[00:13:47.085 --> 00:13:48.807]  I think we should have more doctors as president here.
[00:13:50.028 --> 00:13:51.469]  Five African presidents.
[00:13:52.984 --> 00:13:54.065]  All ended up dying.
[00:13:54.105 --> 00:13:55.486]  Some of them shot, killed, blown up.
[00:13:55.566 --> 00:13:59.028]  Others mysteriously just fell over dead when they wouldn't let Pfizer and Moderna in.
[00:13:59.408 --> 00:14:00.689]  Oh, and you know what happened in Africa?
[00:14:01.029 --> 00:14:05.232]  They have the lowest COVID rate and lowest death rate in the world because they won't take the shots.
[00:14:05.773 --> 00:14:07.014]  Israel has the most shots.
[00:14:07.294 --> 00:14:10.076]  They've got the highest infection, hospitalization, and death rate.
[00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:15.919]  But they run these lying headlines ad nauseam everywhere, like this one out of the Washington Post.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:20.983]  COVID deaths highest in a year as Omicron targets the unvaccinated and the elderly.
[00:14:22.247 --> 00:14:23.828]  But it's not the unvaccinated that are dying.
[00:14:24.108 --> 00:14:25.068]  It is the vaccinated.
[00:14:25.669 --> 00:14:30.191]  That's the real numbers, but they don't care, because they're your enemy, and they're lying to you.
[00:14:30.931 --> 00:14:44.817]  But now, Pfizer's having to come out and admit to its shareholders, get ready for really bad news to come out, because more documents are coming out, and we know what you murdering eugenics trash did, and you will be held accountable.
[00:14:46.258 --> 00:14:48.599]  I really feel sorry for people that haven't seen the light.
[00:14:51.476 --> 00:14:54.017]  There's nothing more beautiful than that light.
[00:14:56.237 --> 00:15:01.919]  Those that saw the light, our ancestors, recreated it in cathedrals with beautiful stained glass.
[00:15:02.919 --> 00:15:05.260]  It looks just like that, but more beautiful than you could imagine.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:11.102]  The fractals beyond the most beautiful kaleidoscope you could ever imagine.
[00:15:14.363 --> 00:15:15.123]  I've seen the light.
[00:15:17.324 --> 00:15:18.024]  I've seen the light.
[00:15:21.954 --> 00:15:23.095]  Gotta feel sorry for our enemies.
[00:15:23.595 --> 00:15:24.416]  They haven't seen the light.
[00:15:25.436 --> 00:15:26.717]  I saw the light!
[00:15:27.418 --> 00:15:28.818]  Alright, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:30.479 --> 00:15:36.383]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live, February 9th, 2022 transmission.
[00:15:38.104 --> 00:15:39.425]  There's no way to do this justice.
[00:15:39.565 --> 00:15:45.669]  I mean... HIV levels are suddenly exploding worldwide.
[00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:49.011]  And suddenly it's much deadlier and killing people much faster.
[00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:49.112]  Yeah.
[00:15:50.242 --> 00:15:51.823]  We told you it's the injection.
[00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:54.766]  Top scientists told you two years ago.
[00:15:56.067 --> 00:16:01.371]  There's videos at Man.Video where I go on for hours with the top scientists warning everyone.
[00:16:03.953 --> 00:16:06.455]  And sure as hell, it's happening.
[00:16:06.475 --> 00:16:07.175]  They're like, oh!
[00:16:10.378 --> 00:16:10.918]  Guess what?
[00:16:11.779 --> 00:16:15.102]  COVID vaccine could increase risk of HIV infection.
[00:16:16.603 --> 00:16:18.184]  Wow!
[00:16:18.144 --> 00:16:29.062]   three minutes ago. Of course they warned you back actually at the time.
[00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.089]  That's actually an old article.
[00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:33.990]  You see, they're always throwing it in your face.
[00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:41.990]   That's a good six, seven months after I first broke that news.
[00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.230]  (clicking)
[00:16:43.281 --> 00:16:45.403]  They even covered their ass there, didn't they?
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.641]  I mean, how do you just cover something like that and just move on to the next thing, you know what I mean?
[00:16:54.661 --> 00:16:55.922]  Because each one of these is like that.
[00:16:55.942 --> 00:16:57.782]  This is a full-out assault.
[00:16:59.803 --> 00:17:07.625]  And then I've got news in Australia, news in Europe, news in the UK, news in Canada, and news in the U.S.
[00:17:09.305 --> 00:17:15.707]  that sounds like it's something you'd hear out of Communist China or North Korea or you read about in a history book in the Soviet Union.
[00:17:19.269 --> 00:17:37.882]  We told you yesterday how the Capitol Police have set up offices all over the country in fake companies, repair companies, and then they break into people's offices and spy on them in Congress, in the Capitol, at night and on the weekends, like Nixon's plumbers, but on a much wider scale.
[00:17:39.203 --> 00:17:42.806]  Now they've confirmed they're reading members of Congress's mail.
[00:17:43.786 --> 00:17:49.786]   They're intercepting their mail, sending it to the Justice Department, where they then read it.
[00:17:49.786 --> 00:17:51.786]  [laughs]
[00:17:51.786 --> 00:18:03.786]  Louie Gohmert's upset about it, and he should be.
[00:18:03.786 --> 00:18:13.786]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:18:04.949 --> 00:18:05.509]  And they admit it.
[00:18:05.589 --> 00:18:06.490]  They go, yeah, we read your mail.
[00:18:07.231 --> 00:18:08.071]  What are you going to do about it?
[00:18:10.773 --> 00:18:12.034]  And then what's happening in Canada?
[00:18:13.335 --> 00:18:23.884]  The Prime Minister that said on TV he wants to be a dictator and loves China's dictatorship, close quote, that he admires the quote, basic dictatorship of Xi Jinping.
[00:18:25.154 --> 00:18:27.235]  The guy that says you shouldn't be allowed to have free speech.
[00:18:27.615 --> 00:18:30.037]  The guy that wants to forcibly inject you or you can't leave your house.
[00:18:30.577 --> 00:18:33.179]  The guy that says if you haven't had all your injections, no one can come to your home.
[00:18:34.259 --> 00:18:35.840]  Gatherings of five or more are illegal.
[00:18:38.482 --> 00:18:39.342]  That's martial law.
[00:18:40.403 --> 00:18:43.985]  I now have so many clips I can't even play them all, but we'll play some next segment.
[00:18:44.085 --> 00:18:44.345]  A few.
[00:18:45.146 --> 00:18:52.710]  Saying, you are terrorists, you are traitors, and you're going to be arrested, and we're going to put you in prison.
[00:18:54.588 --> 00:19:00.375]  If you come out and peacefully protest and say you don't want to be forcibly ejected, I mean, the bottom fell out.
[00:19:00.695 --> 00:19:07.964]  They've gone all the way, and I've got CNN and MSNBC all attacking the truckers and calling them terrorists as well.
[00:19:09.305 --> 00:19:10.627]  I mean, it's full on, folks.
[00:19:10.647 --> 00:19:12.109]  They know we've broken with them.
[00:19:12.389 --> 00:19:13.370]  They know we're awake.
[00:19:13.711 --> 00:19:14.652]  No one's watching them.
[00:19:15.444 --> 00:19:17.065]  They have 100,000 viewers on average.
[00:19:17.546 --> 00:19:19.147]  We have 3-4 million viewers on average.
[00:19:19.448 --> 00:19:21.209]  Joe has more like 20 million on average now.
[00:19:21.609 --> 00:19:22.030]  Joe Rogan.
[00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.211]  And that's a concern.
[00:19:23.251 --> 00:19:26.834]  In fact, by the way, Joe showed me some of the real numbers, which they haven't released yet.
[00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:29.136]  He told me not to tell you till they decide to release them.
[00:19:29.176 --> 00:19:33.380]  But let me tell you, it's not 11 million people downloading it.
[00:19:34.261 --> 00:19:38.004]  It's 11 million downloading the average in the United States.
[00:19:41.287 --> 00:19:45.473]   So Wow, wait till they learn this, these numbers.
[00:19:46.614 --> 00:19:47.695]  Stratospheric.
[00:19:48.015 --> 00:19:49.396]  I've never heard of anything this big.
[00:19:51.017 --> 00:19:56.582]  We had 80-something million different IP addresses at InfoWars in a three-day period during the 2016 election.
[00:19:56.602 --> 00:19:57.543]  That was the biggest we ever were.
[00:19:57.883 --> 00:20:00.125]  We had days with 20-plus million people on the site.
[00:20:00.605 --> 00:20:02.907]  Now, Drudge is bigger than that, but that's the biggest we've ever been.
[00:20:03.648 --> 00:20:11.614]  Rogan, he showed me the numbers, but I'm going to shut up now, because he said don't tell people yet.
[00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:17.190]  Of course Rumble's trying to double down on their offer and hire Rogan.
[00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:19.811]  Anywhere Rogan goes is gonna make hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:20:20.671 --> 00:20:23.372]  But that's not what Joe cares about, believe me.
[00:20:24.352 --> 00:20:25.112]  And I'll leave it at that.
[00:20:26.172 --> 00:20:32.114]  Do you have any idea how much money Rogan already made over the years of sponsorships and all the companies he's endorsed?
[00:20:32.134 --> 00:20:33.034]  I mean, do you have any idea?
[00:20:33.794 --> 00:20:36.035]  He's made way more money on that than the Spotify deal.
[00:20:36.055 --> 00:20:37.655]  I mean, Joe Rogan's a billionaire.
[00:20:37.675 --> 00:20:38.415]  Okay?
[00:20:38.876 --> 00:20:39.636]  I'm gonna stop right there.
[00:20:39.976 --> 00:20:45.196]   But He doesn't care about what they're doing and he's laughing at them.
[00:20:45.656 --> 00:20:46.516]  Sorry, I'm digressing.
[00:20:47.776 --> 00:20:54.817]  Now, InfoWars is the real black sheep embattled and running down like an old clock here if we don't get prayer and support.
[00:20:55.157 --> 00:21:05.339]  And boy, do all of you not get incredible credit, ladies and gentlemen, for your support of this broadcast over the years so we'd be here now at this critical time.
[00:21:06.579 --> 00:21:09.880]  I mean, you talk about absolute vindication.
[00:21:11.665 --> 00:21:16.631]  Absolute vindication with everything coming out we've talked about.
[00:21:17.953 --> 00:21:26.563]  And now if we could just stop the nuclear war and arrest the head of Pfizer and Fauci and have a war crime tribunal, we could beat this thing really quick, but prophecy must be fulfilled.
[00:21:28.755 --> 00:21:31.097]  The devil will get his 15 minutes of fame.
[00:21:31.417 --> 00:21:32.838]  But it's a very short time.
[00:21:32.898 --> 00:21:33.598]  Is it a year from now?
[00:21:33.618 --> 00:21:34.099]  10 years from now?
[00:21:34.119 --> 00:21:34.679]  20 years from now?
[00:21:34.779 --> 00:21:35.159]  I don't know.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.661]  But this is definitely the Mark of the Beast precursors.
[00:21:38.121 --> 00:21:40.443]  This is definitely the shape of things to come very soon.
[00:21:40.823 --> 00:21:46.387]  And the resistance we build now, that'll get sucked under and beaten for a season.
[00:21:46.927 --> 00:21:48.969]  We'll lose a couple quarters in the game.
[00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:53.092]  We'll lose a few periods.
[00:21:53.932 --> 00:21:55.433]  We'll lose five or six innings.
[00:21:56.934 --> 00:21:58.993]   But we're gonna win In the end.
[00:21:59.854 --> 00:22:02.876]  So I can tell you this is all incredible.
[00:22:04.457 --> 00:22:05.618]  It is amazing.
[00:22:06.939 --> 00:22:11.802]  But all over the world, the forced injections or you go to jail, not Oh, you can't leave your house.
[00:22:11.862 --> 00:22:13.403]  No, you're going to jail.
[00:22:13.543 --> 00:22:18.326]  If you leave your house, Australia and Austria, their names sound the same different parts of the world.
[00:22:18.366 --> 00:22:23.149]  But as they're going down the alphabet with the a a country's first, this America's next.
[00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:28.134]   You know, Biden tried all that, but it It didn't work.
[00:22:28.154 --> 00:22:31.396]  It's not like, oh, the science now says you don't need masks.
[00:22:31.696 --> 00:22:33.237]  The science now says you don't need shots.
[00:22:33.257 --> 00:22:35.558]  See, they're trying to back off because they know they woke you up.
[00:22:35.998 --> 00:22:38.580]  Yeah, you bit off more than you can chew, you damn devils!
[00:22:40.081 --> 00:22:45.124]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have found the most demonized, lied-about, censored broadcast in the world.
[00:22:46.544 --> 00:22:49.786]  And if you go anywhere on the internet, people are saying, we love Alex Jones, but where is he?
[00:22:49.945 --> 00:22:53.844]   Well, you're the folks smart enough to know how to come find the show at Band.Video and
[00:22:53.844 --> 00:22:54.846]  InfoWars.com.
[00:22:54.846 --> 00:22:59.044]   And that may seem simple to you, but there's a lot of people that just get habituated to
[00:22:59.044 --> 00:23:03.445]   watching and seeing and hearing things on Instagram, on Twitter, on Google.
[00:23:03.445 --> 00:23:08.525]   And if it's not in the search engine and they bury us 20 pages down, they don't find it.
[00:23:08.525 --> 00:23:10.284]  That's why you're the emissaries.
[00:23:10.284 --> 00:23:11.765]  You're the ambassadors.
[00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:19.324]   You are the missionaries of truth that send people the live feeds from InfoWars.com/show
[00:23:19.324 --> 00:23:20.324]  or Band.Video.
[00:23:20.324 --> 00:23:22.965]  Oh, but those are banned on most platforms.
[00:23:22.965 --> 00:23:31.645]   So you just send them futurenews.news and say, "Here is the verboten site that no one
[00:23:32.601 --> 00:23:35.343]  We can really use the Streisand effect against them.
[00:23:35.363 --> 00:23:41.828]  All right, let me get into this right now because it's just so huge.
[00:23:42.722 --> 00:23:51.886]  And it's what's happening up in Canada that's now inspired people in the US and all over the world, all over Europe, all over the UK, all over Australia, New Zealand.
[00:23:52.546 --> 00:24:05.631]  Truckers and peaceful people are going to their major cities and their capitals and they're just in camping and they're honking their horns and saying, we won't be forcibly injected to have our jobs or to drive a truck.
[00:24:06.392 --> 00:24:07.292]  And we're sick of the lockdowns.
[00:24:07.332 --> 00:24:08.012]  We're sick of the tyranny.
[00:24:09.373 --> 00:24:13.406]   And I know one of my producers warned of this weeks ago, and now it's happening.
[00:24:15.267 --> 00:24:20.190]  They're saying that there's auto part problems in Detroit because of the truckers.
[00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:25.493]  And they're saying that there's not enough food on the shelves at your grocery stores because of the truckers.
[00:24:27.114 --> 00:24:36.939]  And yeah, they probably contribute 5% to what's happening, maybe, in those areas, but not even 1% in the aggregate over a whole country.
[00:24:38.214 --> 00:24:39.415]  But what are they supposed to do?
[00:24:39.455 --> 00:24:40.835]  We're all being put under siege.
[00:24:40.855 --> 00:24:42.316]  We're all being told we're not essential.
[00:24:42.596 --> 00:24:43.896]  We're all being told we're worthless.
[00:24:44.136 --> 00:24:47.698]  We're all being told that they will pick and choose who is allowed to go out and do what.
[00:24:47.958 --> 00:24:55.281]  And people start saying, no, peacefully, we have a right under the Declaration of Independence to get violent with these people at this point.
[00:24:55.341 --> 00:24:58.922]  I think that's a bad move and we shouldn't do it because we're winning politically.
[00:24:59.543 --> 00:25:04.325]  But countless videos of them slamming old people to the ground that are caught out honking their horns.
[00:25:04.785 --> 00:25:07.786]  This is the stuff that will bring down these tyrants forever.
[00:25:10.313 --> 00:25:15.236]  So I want to play for you a clip of one of the city council women, and there are just countless.
[00:25:15.256 --> 00:25:17.217]  This is not just a lone person saying this.
[00:25:17.678 --> 00:25:17.958]  U.S.
[00:25:18.018 --> 00:25:18.778]  media is saying it.
[00:25:18.798 --> 00:25:19.959]  Canadian media is saying it.
[00:25:21.220 --> 00:25:28.104]  The same Ottawa city councilor who called for their GoFundMe to be seized, and it was $11 million from the truckers.
[00:25:28.144 --> 00:25:29.605]  GoFundMe said, we're going to give it to liberals.
[00:25:29.645 --> 00:25:31.066]  People had a backlash.
[00:25:31.086 --> 00:25:31.947]  They said, OK, we won't.
[00:25:32.833 --> 00:25:33.773]  They still kept the money.
[00:25:34.254 --> 00:25:35.434]  I mean, what a criminal group.
[00:25:35.934 --> 00:25:43.137]  This woman, counselor who called Canadian truckers terrorists, doubles down and calls them traitors.
[00:25:43.197 --> 00:25:44.517]  They're guilty of treason.
[00:25:44.577 --> 00:25:54.721]  No, you people following the Great Reset and the Pfizer corporate takeover and the post-industrial world and training us all we're on lockdown and training us that we're prisoners and you're the jail guard.
[00:25:55.041 --> 00:25:58.262]  You are the clear and present danger.
[00:25:58.362 --> 00:25:59.462]  You are the monster.
[00:25:59.802 --> 00:26:00.823]  You are the problem.
[00:26:01.003 --> 00:26:01.503]  Here she is.
[00:26:03.797 --> 00:26:05.318]  We all need to work together.
[00:26:05.358 --> 00:26:08.119]  This is not something this country has ever seen before.
[00:26:08.139 --> 00:26:12.061]  I understand Mark Carney referred to it as sedition today.
[00:26:12.141 --> 00:26:13.941]  I think that's exactly what it is.
[00:26:14.021 --> 00:26:14.922]  This is treason.
[00:26:15.302 --> 00:26:16.682]  This is way bigger.
[00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:23.485]  This is a group of well-polished professional people that are trying to overthrow the government.
[00:26:23.825 --> 00:26:28.544]   the government of democratically elected government of this country.
[00:26:28.544 --> 00:26:31.865]  This is not, it's not a target on the city of Ottawa.
[00:26:31.865 --> 00:26:33.065]  It's much bigger than that.
[00:26:33.065 --> 00:26:34.744]  It's really an insurrection.
[00:26:34.744 --> 00:26:37.225]  It's a, it's an attack on our democracy.
[00:26:37.225 --> 00:26:39.545]  It's an attack on our federal government.
[00:26:39.545 --> 00:26:43.745]  It has a lot of international elements to it.
[00:26:43.745 --> 00:26:46.144]  The money is flowing from the U S.
[00:26:46.144 --> 00:26:49.183]  This was right out of the Trump playbook.
[00:26:49.183 --> 00:26:52.864]  Everything she says is inversion and projection.
[00:26:53.785 --> 00:26:59.224]   There's a worldwide great reset operation lockstep UN Debo's group
[00:26:59.224 --> 00:27:03.625]   Bilderberg operation where they brag, they're running it to shut us down
[00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:07.943]   and bankrupt us to put us on a universal basic income, make so many people homeless.
[00:27:07.943 --> 00:27:13.105]   They're going to nationalize all housing like the CDC tried last year and make
[00:27:13.105 --> 00:27:15.544]  you put homeless people in your house.
[00:27:16.345 --> 00:27:18.866]  The CDC announced new plans today on it.
[00:27:19.706 --> 00:27:21.647]  San Francisco announced new plans.
[00:27:21.667 --> 00:27:23.067]  I have the article right here.
[00:27:23.087 --> 00:27:24.128]  We'll cover it next segment.
[00:27:26.068 --> 00:27:33.691]  But these people are at war with our infrastructure, at war with our economy, clouded and pivened to bankrupt us, to make us come under their control.
[00:27:33.931 --> 00:27:37.712]  Klaus Schwab writes books bragging about it, and he goes on TV and says it.
[00:27:39.406 --> 00:27:49.035]  They are totally taking thousands of years of war and struggle to get basic freedoms cemented and protected, and they're washing it away.
[00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:56.883]  That's why everything they do is designed to bring down the civilization and bring down the society.
[00:27:57.143 --> 00:27:58.605]  I love this meme that's been going around.
[00:27:59.688 --> 00:28:03.651]  Libs in December of 2021 shows a guy looking at his computer screen.
[00:28:03.671 --> 00:28:07.073]  He says, make life as difficult as possible for the unvaccinated.
[00:28:07.453 --> 00:28:09.154]  Don't let them work or go out in public.
[00:28:09.435 --> 00:28:10.435]  Make them feel pain.
[00:28:10.475 --> 00:28:11.396]  Those are all real quotes.
[00:28:12.216 --> 00:28:16.559]  By mainstream TV, corporate people, big heads of companies want to make you take their product.
[00:28:16.879 --> 00:28:18.881]  A company is going to lock you up if you don't take their product.
[00:28:20.522 --> 00:28:22.883]  Libs in 2022 crying red eyes.
[00:28:23.144 --> 00:28:25.405]  Why won't they stop honking?
[00:28:27.426 --> 00:28:30.443]   We just want to put A poison into their body.
[00:28:30.463 --> 00:28:33.804]  Why don't they like it?
[00:28:35.525 --> 00:28:39.927]  Blockade a key U.S.-Canadian border highway could paralyze Detroit auto industry.
[00:28:40.268 --> 00:28:41.068]  Well, you know what?
[00:28:41.288 --> 00:28:42.849]  They already shipped most of that out of the country.
[00:28:43.369 --> 00:28:44.470]  And so they put us under siege.
[00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:45.730]  We gotta put the globalists under siege.
[00:28:45.991 --> 00:28:46.931]  Show them who's got the power.
[00:28:47.231 --> 00:28:48.072]  They started the war.
[00:28:48.332 --> 00:28:49.972]  We're just peacefully showing we got the power.
[00:28:50.933 --> 00:28:55.395]  Trudeau gaslights Canadians in speech-condemning trucker convoy, saying they're criminals and terrorists.
[00:28:55.595 --> 00:28:56.776]  He gets booed the whole time.
[00:28:58.826 --> 00:29:01.449]  And it just goes on and on from there.
[00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:08.057]  I've got a progressive supercut of smash the workers' revolt.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:14.265]  And we've got suddenly, oh, CNN doctor, former head of Planned Parenthood.
[00:29:15.305 --> 00:29:19.726]  The lady that says, you know, keep people in their houses, they don't take the shots, make kids wear masks.
[00:29:20.126 --> 00:29:28.168]  Well now, Mrs. Baby Hitler, CNN doctor, the science has changed, so lift COVID restrictions, now masks don't work.
[00:29:29.068 --> 00:29:29.168]  Ah!
[00:29:30.609 --> 00:29:34.749]  Clown Olympic Canadian hockey team wears mask for entire game.
[00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:39.010]  Of course, it's the big Stockholm Syndrome Canada that's finally waking up.
[00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.091]  I mean, that is all a Milgram experiment.
[00:29:42.905 --> 00:29:46.987]  CNN flips script on masks again, says mask mandates can end because science has changed.
[00:29:47.027 --> 00:29:48.888]  Science is whatever they say, folks.
[00:29:49.509 --> 00:29:52.490]  High profile Democrat apologizes for maskless school photo.
[00:29:53.111 --> 00:29:53.651]  What a cult.
[00:29:54.545 --> 00:29:55.205]  What a cult.
[00:29:55.525 --> 00:29:56.246]  It's all coming up.
[00:29:56.306 --> 00:29:59.567]  I got so much more next segment, ladies and gentlemen, but this is just insane.
[00:30:00.167 --> 00:30:01.608]  They bit off more than they can chew.
[00:30:01.988 --> 00:30:02.949]  They made their run at us.
[00:30:02.969 --> 00:30:04.549]  They had these battle plans on the shelf.
[00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:08.611]  But the best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[00:30:09.051 --> 00:30:10.852]  Separately, I'm not Joe Rogan.
[00:30:11.032 --> 00:30:12.613]  I don't have hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank.
[00:30:13.371 --> 00:30:17.193]  I'm running an independent network with our own servers, our own platforms, our own systems.
[00:30:17.513 --> 00:30:22.636]  Joe's visited many times and said this is the model of the future if he gets censored a couple miles down the road.
[00:30:23.157 --> 00:30:29.280]  All I'm saying is we built this infrastructure, there's other infrastructures, there's emergency backups that have been constructed that other folks have.
[00:30:30.641 --> 00:30:31.702]  We're busy people here.
[00:30:31.742 --> 00:30:32.342]  This is a war.
[00:30:32.382 --> 00:30:33.222]  We know how serious this is.
[00:30:33.283 --> 00:30:37.025]  We need funds to prosecute this war and we have great products to eat at the same time.
[00:30:38.727 --> 00:30:40.289]  X3 has been sold out for four months.
[00:30:40.329 --> 00:30:41.931]  It's all three good types of iodine.
[00:30:42.211 --> 00:30:49.680]  The deep earth crystal iodine, two other types, to supercharge your immune system, to turbocharge your libido, your stamina, your energy, everything.
[00:30:50.021 --> 00:30:55.908]  If you haven't experienced iodine, real iodine, not the bound crappy type, it takes a few weeks to kick in, usually about 15 days, 16 days.
[00:30:56.949 --> 00:30:59.030]  But once it does, you really feel it.
[00:30:59.050 --> 00:31:00.551]  When you forget to take it, you feel it.
[00:31:00.932 --> 00:31:02.593]  So, X3 is in stock.
[00:31:02.833 --> 00:31:03.793]  X2 is sold out.
[00:31:04.274 --> 00:31:05.394]  X3, they're apples and oranges.
[00:31:05.414 --> 00:31:06.095]  They're both excellent.
[00:31:06.395 --> 00:31:08.536]  It's 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:08.896 --> 00:31:10.777]  If you haven't tried it, get it, experience it.
[00:31:11.038 --> 00:31:13.179]  You've never bought something at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:14.116 --> 00:31:15.557]  I know most of you haven't that are listeners.
[00:31:16.057 --> 00:31:17.458]  It's a small minority keeping us on air.
[00:31:17.839 --> 00:31:27.205]  If the majority of you, or even a large minority, would buy a t-shirt, buy a book, buy a film, we could really stay on air and not be in so much issues constantly.
[00:31:27.225 --> 00:31:29.307]  But I want to expand in the face of the global.
[00:31:29.327 --> 00:31:30.107]  Let's not contract.
[00:31:30.408 --> 00:31:31.328]  So Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.

[00:31:50.035 --> 00:31:51.996]  They haven't done that deal in four years.
[00:31:52.337 --> 00:31:54.018]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[00:31:55.559 --> 00:31:56.440]  I want freedom.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.541]  I want justice.
[00:31:59.462 --> 00:32:01.503]  And I want a connection to God in eternity.
[00:32:02.804 --> 00:32:04.385]  And I want to be separated from the devil.
[00:32:06.367 --> 00:32:07.908]  And I want to be separated from Hollywood.
[00:32:07.728 --> 00:32:14.728]   And I want to be separated from the Davos group for eternity.
[00:32:14.728 --> 00:32:20.468]  It's always the most unlikely of places.
[00:32:20.483 --> 00:32:23.823]  Hard-working, sweet, good Canadians.
[00:32:24.463 --> 00:32:25.024]  Great people.
[00:32:25.724 --> 00:32:26.964]  They're just like Midwesterners.
[00:32:29.925 --> 00:32:31.325]  And they're sick of getting pushed around.
[00:32:35.746 --> 00:32:39.787]  And the system did everything it could to try to silence them and demonize them, but nobody's buying it.
[00:32:41.728 --> 00:32:53.380]   Also, if you look at even the major newspapers up there, they have to admit Okay, they call them white supremacists, this is a very diverse group of people, and that's what really scares the hell out of them.
[00:32:54.761 --> 00:33:01.647]  But here is the dead corporate media, the zombie media, because they're still the defense contractors and the big banks and the New World Order.
[00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:08.746]   Keep them propped up like Frankenstein with their money, with their lightning bolts of billions in funding.
[00:33:08.746 --> 00:33:15.746]  And there they are, demonizing the truckers.
[00:33:16.148 --> 00:33:24.515]  You just heard the City Council saying they're terrorists, they're traitors, they're engaged in treason, they're seditionists, they need to be put in prison!
[00:33:28.079 --> 00:33:30.100]  And then everything they say the truckers have done, they've done.
[00:33:30.401 --> 00:33:42.385]   You know, if the truckers protest everywhere and there's not some food or medicine that makes it in, that's like the pain of having a rotten tooth Injected with Novocaine.
[00:33:42.525 --> 00:33:44.588]  There's a little pain before you fix the tooth.
[00:33:46.211 --> 00:33:48.655]  The infection and the disease is the New World Order.
[00:33:49.597 --> 00:33:52.783]  And now the truckers or the dentist going in there to fix the tooth.
[00:33:54.446 --> 00:34:03.212]  And so yeah, there may be some pain in this, but people saying, oh my God, if they take action, they'll blame us and say we caused the shutdown and we caused the collapse.
[00:34:03.412 --> 00:34:15.940]  Well, if everybody's dumb enough after two years of being under siege and 40 plus million people starving to death in the third world caused by the lockdowns, not by the virus, to then believe that the truckers are the villains.
[00:34:17.862 --> 00:34:24.228]  Bringing the globalists to a standstill and saying, we don't want your policies, well then we don't deserve freedom and we're that stupid.
[00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:30.234]  Detroit announced that they're shutting down eight of their factories a month ago.
[00:34:31.295 --> 00:34:37.581]  This week, they said in a month, we're going to shut down eight plants in Michigan because we can't get the chips.
[00:34:38.678 --> 00:34:39.378]  The chips.
[00:34:40.099 --> 00:34:44.120]  And that's caused because of the lockdowns in Asia and the COVID hysteria.
[00:34:44.601 --> 00:34:51.743]  It was all over the news, but now the media's, oh, the plants are shutting down because the truckers.
[00:34:53.784 --> 00:34:54.084]  Uh-huh.
[00:34:54.104 --> 00:34:56.625]  Uh-huh.
[00:34:56.846 --> 00:34:57.286]  Yeah, right.
[00:34:59.707 --> 00:35:02.328]  So if we believe that, we deserve what happens to us.
[00:35:04.506 --> 00:35:06.468]  And let me just say this before we play this compilation.
[00:35:06.488 --> 00:35:10.010]  Go ahead and play the MSM Demonize the Trucker compilation.
[00:35:10.290 --> 00:35:11.551]  Their war on the working class.
[00:35:12.332 --> 00:35:14.413]  Progressive smash the workers revolt.
[00:35:14.454 --> 00:35:14.774]  Here it is.
[00:35:15.566 --> 00:35:16.086]  Sedition.
[00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:17.147]  Insurrection.
[00:35:17.347 --> 00:35:18.548]  A threat to democracy.
[00:35:18.608 --> 00:35:19.869]  This city is under siege.
[00:35:20.089 --> 00:35:21.730]  They are now calling it an occupation.
[00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:23.331]  Alarming situation there in Ottawa.
[00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:27.933]  The police chief is calling it a nationwide insurrection driven by madness.
[00:35:28.033 --> 00:35:32.076]  This is kind of our insurrection by air horn moment.
[00:35:32.576 --> 00:35:34.497]  I think it's part of the globalization of Trumpism.
[00:35:34.537 --> 00:35:36.038]  Canadians know where I stand.
[00:35:36.118 --> 00:35:41.741]  There hasn't been as much violence as some had perhaps projected, but that does not necessarily mean that it has been peaceful.
[00:35:41.841 --> 00:35:45.183]  Reports of severe vandalism and criminal behavior.
[00:35:45.263 --> 00:35:46.064]  Streets are clogged.
[00:35:46.124 --> 00:35:48.065]  The honking is incessant and deafening.
[00:35:48.085 --> 00:35:51.807]  This pandemic has sucked for all Canadians.
[00:35:51.907 --> 00:35:56.430]  Residents that I have spoken to who say they feel terrorized, intimidated.
[00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:58.911]  Residents say they feel like hostages.
[00:35:59.091 --> 00:36:08.054]  Residents in that area say that they are being held hostage, that this Freedom Convoy, as they call it, has essentially imposed a lockdown on them.
[00:36:08.194 --> 00:36:10.475]  Some protesters harassed a soup kitchen.
[00:36:10.535 --> 00:36:14.876]  These anti-vaxxers actually took food from the mouths of the homeless.
[00:36:15.016 --> 00:36:15.676]  Hungry, yeah.
[00:36:15.777 --> 00:36:17.817]  Because they're so put upon.
[00:36:17.877 --> 00:36:19.578]  There have not been any violent outbursts.
[00:36:19.598 --> 00:36:21.298]  By the way, stop it for a minute.
[00:36:21.999 --> 00:36:23.059]  Back it up a few seconds, please.
[00:36:24.757 --> 00:36:30.078]  Can Rob Dew or Darren McBrain or somebody of our hard-working crew, because I don't want to spend a lot of time on this, but I want to hear it today.
[00:36:31.178 --> 00:36:32.699]  Can someone take this three-minute video?
[00:36:32.719 --> 00:36:34.279]  We're gonna finish the last minute here in a second.
[00:36:34.699 --> 00:36:36.320]  And just everything they say, put the truth.
[00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:39.680]  Show cops beating people up, including black people.
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:45.882]  In the middle of the George Floyd thing, you got white cops and black cops beating black people up in New York that don't wear a mask.
[00:36:45.922 --> 00:36:47.962]  I mean, beating them over the head with clubs.
[00:36:48.822 --> 00:36:50.563]  We got dogs biting people.
[00:36:50.863 --> 00:36:54.882]   We've got people being Their eyeballs knocked out in Germany.
[00:36:55.222 --> 00:36:59.346]  We've got old ladies being body slammed, their heads into concrete in Australia.
[00:36:59.786 --> 00:37:03.450]  We have the numbers, 280 plus million on verge of starvation.
[00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:04.551]  25 million starved to death.
[00:37:04.791 --> 00:37:07.214]  Now another 20 something million, 40 plus million dead.
[00:37:08.455 --> 00:37:09.376]  All those headlines!
[00:37:11.184 --> 00:37:15.307]  Lockdowns caused tens of millions to starve to death, depression, suicide.
[00:37:16.508 --> 00:37:18.590]  Lockdowns caused global food shortage.
[00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:31.361]  Well, Mika Brzezinski, whose father was a war criminal, whose father called for exterminating most of the general population, Zbigniew Brzezinski, is up there caring about you while they've been in a war against humanity.
[00:37:31.601 --> 00:37:41.549]   And now these peaceful truckers showing all the weak-minded people that the majority don't stand with this and letting them know they're not alone Their leadership scares the tyrants!
[00:37:43.591 --> 00:37:45.952]  I'm gonna hit the key in a moment, but let's finish up with this.
[00:37:46.533 --> 00:37:48.574]  Protesters harassed a soup kitchen.
[00:37:48.614 --> 00:37:53.018]  These anti-vaxxers actually took food from the mouths of the homeless.
[00:37:53.118 --> 00:37:53.778]  Hungry, yeah.
[00:37:53.879 --> 00:37:55.940]  Because they were so put upon.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.682]  There have not been any violent outbursts.
[00:37:57.702 --> 00:38:00.964]  However, horns have been honking for 12 to 21 hours a night.
[00:38:00.984 --> 00:38:13.724]   The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa or who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing.
[00:38:13.844 --> 00:38:16.226]  Many of them are holding confederate flags.
[00:38:16.286 --> 00:38:18.888]  I've heard there's QAnon supporters in the crowd.
[00:38:18.908 --> 00:38:25.573]  We've seen swastikas, we've seen the confederate flag, we've seen flags with Justin Trudeau, our prime minister, in a noose.
[00:38:25.613 --> 00:38:28.716]  Lots of Donald Trump flags as well, people chanting, let's go Brandon.
[00:38:28.756 --> 00:38:34.300]  It is actually one of the rare times in history you're going to see swastikas and yellow stars at the same protest.
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:37.562]   A few people By the way, back that up again 10 seconds.
[00:38:38.162 --> 00:38:41.323]  I love the bouncy house in the background when they talk about swastikas.
[00:38:41.863 --> 00:38:53.087]  Folks, it's people showing Trudeau a swastika saying he's a Nazi and then people showing Jewish stars because you got to get a shot to leave your house or have a job or be tracked if you're unvaccinated.
[00:38:55.027 --> 00:38:59.689]  I mean, just look at these yipping dogs of the mainstream media that are truly our enemies.
[00:39:00.969 --> 00:39:03.090]  They are truly the plague and the scourge.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.182]  Got a big OAN reporter.
[00:39:05.202 --> 00:39:06.605]  There's a lot of great OAN reporters.
[00:39:06.625 --> 00:39:10.451]  My favorite OAN reporter is coming up, Pearson Sharp, next hour.
[00:39:10.471 --> 00:39:11.072]  I forgot to tell you that.
[00:39:11.092 --> 00:39:11.713]  I should have plugged that.
[00:39:11.733 --> 00:39:12.274]  I apologize.
[00:39:12.594 --> 00:39:13.175]  He's amazing.
[00:39:13.536 --> 00:39:14.037]  That's coming up.
[00:39:14.678 --> 00:39:16.541]  Let's finish up with the compilation.
[00:39:17.859 --> 00:39:23.381]  It is actually one of the rare times in history you're going to see swastikas and yellow stars at the same protest.
[00:39:23.461 --> 00:39:30.223]  A few people shouting and waving swastikas does not define who Canadians are.
[00:39:30.423 --> 00:39:37.525]  Ottawa is being besieged by a group of anti-do-anything-about-COVID truckers called the Freedom Convoy.
[00:39:37.566 --> 00:39:38.946]  A so-called Freedom Convoy.
[00:39:38.966 --> 00:39:41.047]  A so-called Freedom Convoy of truckers.
[00:39:42.607 --> 00:39:44.428]  A cult.
[00:39:44.808 --> 00:39:45.428]  Yes, it is.
[00:39:45.448 --> 00:39:47.969]  We've heard it called a nationwide insurrection.
[00:39:48.009 --> 00:39:51.211]  A threat to democracy, an insurrection, sedition.
[00:39:51.231 --> 00:39:57.313]  This is a moment for responsible leaders to think carefully about where they stand and who they stand with.
[00:40:00.694 --> 00:40:01.875]  Wow, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:02.115 --> 00:40:04.716]  Let me tell you what's really going on here and I'll get into this more next hour.
[00:40:05.618 --> 00:40:09.241]  This is about a purge of the military and the police and the nurses and the doctors.
[00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:11.923]  Because they put out a shot they knew made people sick.
[00:40:12.003 --> 00:40:13.064]  I was asking, why'd they do that?
[00:40:13.104 --> 00:40:14.625]  They want an ID tied to the vaccine.
[00:40:14.645 --> 00:40:17.307]  Why don't they put a placebo out on everybody on board?
[00:40:18.228 --> 00:40:19.389]  No, they want you to get sick.
[00:40:19.409 --> 00:40:20.149]  They want you to get hurt.
[00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:24.393]  So all the smart people see that and go, oh, I'm not doing it.
[00:40:24.513 --> 00:40:30.598]  And then the corporations are ordered to fire them and society breaks down, which is cloud and pivot again, which they admits their plan.
[00:40:32.779 --> 00:40:33.360]  And here it is.
[00:40:34.327 --> 00:40:34.527]  L.A.
[00:40:34.607 --> 00:40:39.551]  County supervisors vote to start firing 4,000 unvaccinated L.A.
[00:40:40.632 --> 00:40:40.973]  S.D.
[00:40:41.013 --> 00:40:41.813]  police officers.
[00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:45.296]  That's the same all over the world.
[00:40:45.316 --> 00:40:47.658]  But oh, guess who's given a waiver?
[00:40:47.798 --> 00:40:53.863]  If you join in on the riot police actions in Canada, the other cops have to take it to Canada.
[00:40:53.883 --> 00:41:00.909]  But if you sign up for riot police, you don't have to, both federal or local, you don't have to get the shot.
[00:41:01.764 --> 00:41:07.229]  Just like the FEMA emergency nurses replacing nurses that have been fired for not taking it, they have an exemption.
[00:41:07.409 --> 00:41:07.829]  Look it up.
[00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:09.711]  We're going to go to break.
[00:41:09.811 --> 00:41:13.014]  Please don't forget these crazy times, supply chain breakdowns and everything.
[00:41:13.074 --> 00:41:18.558]  You're nuts if you don't get storable food, and we've got the best company ready to ship to you at the best price you're going to find even normally.
[00:41:18.818 --> 00:41:22.001]  But at 25% off, they haven't done this in four years.
[00:41:22.041 --> 00:41:23.302]  You cannot beat this deal.
[00:41:23.362 --> 00:41:24.503]  It ends in 48 hours.
[00:41:25.484 --> 00:41:30.868]  So the last couple days to take advantage of this at preparewithalex.com or infowarestore.com.
[00:41:31.168 --> 00:41:41.075]  But preparewithalex.com takes you right to the sub page at infowarestore.com where the full catalog of My Patriot Supplies high quality food is ready for you to order it and get it shipped to you.
[00:41:41.095 --> 00:41:44.095]  And it funds the InfoWar a 360 win.
[00:41:44.095 --> 00:41:50.655]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:41:50.655 --> 00:41:55.774]  Sold out for months, X3 is now back in stock.
[00:41:55.135 --> 00:42:02.578]  Ladies and gentlemen, just like our information is game-changing, our products are game-changing, and so many people are deficient in iodine.
[00:42:02.618 --> 00:42:16.982]  It's not in the soil anymore, most of it in the ocean is contaminated, but when you get high-quality triiodine, all three of the healthy types together, it does amazing things for your stamina, your libido, but most importantly, your immune system.
[00:42:17.942 --> 00:42:26.790]  X3, the only tri-iodine on the market, highest grade, is now exclusively available again at 50% off at infowarshore.com.
[00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:34.717]   If you've not experienced clean, pure iodine, and what it does for your body, it takes about two weeks to kick in on average, You really need to experience X3.
[00:42:35.318 --> 00:42:37.660]  Those of you that have tried it and used it, I know you're going to be reordering it.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:43.143]  But particularly those that haven't ever tried the product, you need it because it's amazing what it does for your body.
[00:42:43.424 --> 00:42:44.925]  It's the good halogen, not the bad halogen.
[00:42:45.345 --> 00:42:47.707]  And it funds the Info Award, a true 360 win.
[00:42:47.967 --> 00:42:50.349]  So again, X3, back in stock.
[00:42:50.689 --> 00:42:51.509]  50% off for a limited time.
[00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:53.651]  There's blood on the streets.
[00:42:56.013 --> 00:42:57.734]  Wow, he's calling for terrorism.
[00:42:57.774 --> 00:42:58.314]  Arrest him.
[00:42:58.334 --> 00:43:01.597]  There's blood on the streets.
[00:43:03.777 --> 00:43:05.118]  No, it's a figure of speech.
[00:43:06.599 --> 00:43:14.425]  Well, when the left actually goes out and engages in blood on the streets and burns building downs and kills people, well, Kamala Harris bails them out because then that's reasonable to do.
[00:43:14.525 --> 00:43:18.108]  We're in the middle of a globalist, communist takeover in this country.
[00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:26.935]  We've got an amazing OAN reporter who I really think is one of the most hardcore, truthful people out there joining us next segment, but I wanted to air this special report.
[00:43:27.395 --> 00:43:29.177]  The wheels are coming off the globalist tyranny.
[00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:38.794]  In the capital city of Ottawa, thousands of truckers and others have clogged the city streets for more than 10 days.
[00:43:39.255 --> 00:43:42.157]  Ottawa's mayor has now declared a state of emergency.
[00:43:42.497 --> 00:43:47.240]  I'm outlining three steps that I believe Doug Ford should be taking right now, urgently.
[00:43:47.581 --> 00:43:51.383]  I think that we need to declare a provincial state of emergency.
[00:43:51.423 --> 00:43:53.445]  This is how serious the situation is.
[00:43:53.645 --> 00:43:56.707]  The wheels are absolutely coming off of everything they're doing.
[00:43:57.168 --> 00:44:14.724]   John Hopkins, which is a very diverse scientific group, and is the preeminent The mission of the Pandemic Emergency Board is to provide recommendations to deal with the major global challenges arising in response to an unfolding pandemic.
[00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:21.033]  The board is comprised of highly experienced leaders from business, public health and civil society.
[00:44:21.773 --> 00:44:28.619]  We could be looking at double the number of cases in one week and 16 times as many in a month if we are not able to stop the spread.
[00:44:29.139 --> 00:44:46.210]   There are pockets and significant pockets of the country where vaccines aren't happening because of those You know, the anti-vaxxers, or whatever you want to call them, who have made significant headway in trying to convince parents they shouldn't vaccinate children.
[00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.791]  Do you get mad about it?
[00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:48.811]  No, I push for it.
[00:44:48.851 --> 00:44:55.654]  I wouldn't say I get angry, but I'm really impatient that we're not moving as fast as I'd like.
[00:44:55.674 --> 00:45:04.919]  The subsequent lies and fraud is now covering its ass by the very working group that was heavily involved with Bill Gates planning all this.
[00:45:09.108 --> 00:45:19.931]  Lockdowns are a fraud and have killed more people than the virus and that the economic destruction of it is going to starve hundreds of millions of people to death, which is true.
[00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:25.193]  Reuters has come out and endorsed ivermectin and its incredible antiviral properties.
[00:45:25.893 --> 00:45:27.954]  Covering your little dirty asses, aren't you?
[00:45:28.494 --> 00:45:31.995]  The head of Reuters on the board of Pfizer and its quarterback, the censorship.
[00:45:32.675 --> 00:45:41.639]   Jeff Zucker, the America-hating hatchet man for this country has now resigned and they
[00:45:41.639 --> 00:45:47.769]   always use the fall on the sword excuse of oh because he was having a relationship that was
[00:45:47.769 --> 00:45:53.758]   inappropriate with somebody that works there they are the big crime is men and women having sex and god
[00:45:53.758 --> 00:45:58.949]   forbid any children come along it wasn't lying it wasn't infiltrating groups it wasn't overseeing
[00:45:58.949 --> 00:46:04.199]   the persecution of millions of people that cnn would covertly and overtly target and
[00:46:04.199 --> 00:46:07.719]   have de-platformed jeff zucker's departure was shocking.
[00:46:08.564 --> 00:46:09.545]  To the staff of CNN.
[00:46:10.106 --> 00:46:23.582]  But the people who say we're lacking journalism, that we've become an all-talk channel, that we've run off and we're all opinions all the time, that Jeff Zucker led us astray, those people aren't watching CNN.
[00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:25.971]  They're not watching CNN.
[00:46:26.712 --> 00:46:30.193]  They're watching complaints about CNN on other channels that don't know what they're talking about.
[00:46:30.313 --> 00:46:31.693]  Joe Rogan's irresponsible!
[00:46:32.013 --> 00:46:34.894]  He took horse maggot medicine the other day!
[00:46:35.374 --> 00:46:40.316]  Now tell me, sir, and don't tell me anything other than this, should there be a war?
[00:46:41.216 --> 00:46:42.837]  Yes, there should be a war!
[00:46:44.085 --> 00:46:44.945]  Interview's done!
[00:46:45.245 --> 00:46:47.626]  I'd like to see you do that, Joe Rogan!
[00:46:47.646 --> 00:46:50.346]  Which sounds great, but not all opinions are created equal.
[00:46:50.547 --> 00:47:02.469]  The crime's not defunding the police, the crime's not opening up the violent people out of the prisons, and having five-fold homicide and carjacking numbers explode in blue cities, a doubling nationwide on average.
[00:47:02.869 --> 00:47:13.543]   The wheels are coming off, the House of Cards is collapsing, the New World Order is in deep Deep, deep, deep trouble.
[00:47:14.304 --> 00:47:15.944]  They knew their system was going down.
[00:47:16.745 --> 00:47:18.985]  You better know these people aren't going to give up.
[00:47:19.986 --> 00:47:22.087]  And they're going to stage false flags and blame it on people.
[00:47:22.587 --> 00:47:24.728]  And they're going to go blow up and shoot up black churches.
[00:47:25.088 --> 00:47:26.408]  And they're going to start war with Russia.
[00:47:26.788 --> 00:47:32.631]  And they're going to try to gut our economy as fast as they can because they know they're going down and they want to take us down with them.
[00:47:34.772 --> 00:47:37.152]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:47:37.293 --> 00:47:38.213]  It's hour number two.
[00:47:39.929 --> 00:47:45.273]  Wednesday, February 9th, 2022, and Pearson Sharp of OAN is about to join us live.
[00:47:46.273 --> 00:47:53.719]  More and more Americans are standing up and fighting the tyranny of the COVID conspiracy theory.
[00:47:54.199 --> 00:48:04.366]  Convoys of outraged truck drivers are sending a message loud and clear to cowardly leaders all over the world, from Canada to Australia and even here in the U.S.
[00:48:04.726 --> 00:48:06.308]  And that message is simple.
[00:48:07.108 --> 00:48:08.949]  Back off or else.
[00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:14.153]  We the people will not tolerate this oppression any longer.
[00:48:14.493 --> 00:48:25.680]  Enough of seeing our children die after being forced to take this same poisonous drug that's making big pharma companies like Pfizer and Moderna over a hundred billion dollars a year.
[00:48:26.041 --> 00:48:33.746]  Since the armed forces rolled out the vaccine in one year, cancer rates are up 300% among military members.
[00:48:36.027 --> 00:48:36.868]  But that's not all.
[00:48:37.228 --> 00:48:44.233]  Infertility is skyrocketing as well, up 500% in women, along with miscarriages, which are up another 300%.
[00:48:44.353 --> 00:48:50.917]  This is a pandemic of the ignorant, and it's killing our country.
[00:48:51.657 --> 00:49:00.643]  So, for all you progressives, and Democrats, and radical leftists out there, do us all a favor, please, and go get vaccinated.
[00:49:00.924 --> 00:49:05.687]  In fact, don't stop there, get double vaccinated, and be sure to get all your boosters, all three or four of them.
[00:49:06.147 --> 00:49:06.847]  Why stop there?
[00:49:07.207 --> 00:49:10.588]  If more is better, get five, six, get ten boosters!
[00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:17.531]  All the rest of us sane, freedom-loving Americans are counting on you to get your injections.
[00:49:18.151 --> 00:49:21.252]  The survival of our country depends on it.
[00:49:22.412 --> 00:49:25.053]  For One American News, I'm Pearson Sharpe.
[00:49:27.094 --> 00:49:29.475]  All right, folks, we're excited to have him on.
[00:49:29.495 --> 00:49:32.917]  I mean, every day when he does his analysis, it's amazing.
[00:49:32.957 --> 00:49:35.238]  It's just a small portion of it.
[00:49:35.258 --> 00:49:39.500]  You can find him on Twitter and on Getter at Pearson Sharp.
[00:49:39.981 --> 00:49:42.822]  And we really appreciate him joining us today.
[00:49:43.262 --> 00:49:51.727]  We have a Syrian girl who actually worked for Pfizer as a major whistleblower coming on and joining us from Australia in the next hour as well.
[00:49:52.087 --> 00:49:53.087]  Pearson, great to have you.
[00:49:53.127 --> 00:49:54.348]  We're all huge fans of you here.
[00:49:56.002 --> 00:49:57.184]  Alex, thank you very much.
[00:49:57.324 --> 00:49:58.767]  It is really an honor to be on here.
[00:49:58.907 --> 00:50:03.815]  You're one of the few truth-tellers in our country right now, and it's a real pleasure to speak with you.
[00:50:03.935 --> 00:50:05.358]  Well, it's a pleasure to have you here, brother.
[00:50:06.138 --> 00:50:11.243]  What is it like being at OAN, seeing it explode in popularity, seeing the censors come after it?
[00:50:11.724 --> 00:50:29.862]  Out of all the great people there, and I watch it hours a day, we have it on here at the office, all over the building, we don't have Fox on anymore, other than Tucker Carlson occasionally, what is it like to see your platform explode, people hungry for the truth, and what is it like to, I think, be the most hardcore person over at OAN?
[00:50:32.267 --> 00:50:35.749]  Well, it's very interesting because, I mean, it is exploding.
[00:50:35.989 --> 00:50:54.521]   And I'm sure, as you know, like you've experienced yourself, when you start telling the truth, when you start presenting evidence and facts and information that, you know, goes against the narrative, goes against what, you know, Big Pharma and Washington are putting out, They come down on you like a ton of bricks.
[00:50:55.061 --> 00:50:57.261]  And OAN, we have tons of support.
[00:50:57.361 --> 00:51:00.502]  The viewer emails that we get just pour in over the country.
[00:51:00.702 --> 00:51:07.344]  We even get emails from overseas, from Mexico, from Australia, from New Zealand, all these other places where they're trying to clamp down on their freedoms as well.
[00:51:08.284 --> 00:51:11.345]  We get viewer emails from everywhere, people giving us their support.
[00:51:11.885 --> 00:51:19.177]   But when you turn on the mainstream media or if you Google search, you know, OAN, That is not the impression that you would get.
[00:51:19.217 --> 00:51:25.659]  It would appear that, you know, we are the most extreme right-wing Nazi propaganda that ever existed since Goebbels.
[00:51:26.039 --> 00:51:27.879]  And that's the message they're trying to promote.
[00:51:27.939 --> 00:51:30.700]  So we're sitting here and we're just giving the truth, you know.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:31.881]  We're finding these facts.
[00:51:31.921 --> 00:51:32.481]  We're presenting it.
[00:51:32.501 --> 00:51:34.141]  We're talking to real live doctors.
[00:51:34.281 --> 00:51:35.442]  We're going to their hospitals.
[00:51:35.482 --> 00:51:43.564]  We're talking to the patients who survived this pandemic thanks to their care, not the vaccine, not, you know, avoiding early treatment, doing all the things they're supposed to do.
[00:51:44.104 --> 00:51:50.748]   And we are being presented as You know, the worst misinformation possible when nothing could be further from the truth.
[00:51:50.768 --> 00:51:53.309]  So it's been fascinating to watch all this happen.
[00:51:53.349 --> 00:52:05.716]  It's like living in two realities, one where the truth exists and you're just reporting it, and another this twisted world where they're distorting the information and trying to present this false narrative and make that the truth instead.
[00:52:05.756 --> 00:52:06.837]  It's absolutely fascinating.
[00:52:07.628 --> 00:52:15.670]  Well, what's amazing is I've watched OAN's since it started many years ago and always did a great job, but just get bigger and stronger and more reporters.
[00:52:16.090 --> 00:52:18.971]  And if I had any criticism, it is that you guys show both sides.
[00:52:19.631 --> 00:52:26.693]  When sometimes we know the other side has already been proven to be liars, they're frauds, but you guys will still show what they have to say.
[00:52:27.113 --> 00:52:30.654]  But I guess in the aggregate, you know, I guess that's the fairest thing to do.
[00:52:31.687 --> 00:52:41.131]  I just love the fact when I watch your reports, because I've already researched this stuff, I know you're not lying about it, you just hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer one point after the other.
[00:52:41.472 --> 00:52:42.372]  It's just devastating.
[00:52:43.733 --> 00:52:44.493]  Well, you have to.
[00:52:44.893 --> 00:52:51.576]  You get to a point where I'm absolutely fed up with watching the destruction of my country.
[00:52:52.357 --> 00:53:19.672]   You are pushed into a corner and you've tried to Be fair and you've tried to give the benefit of the doubt to the other side and you've tried to let everybody have their say but enough is enough and there's just a point where you have to push back and say we've had it and this is how it is and we're not gonna let you get away with this anymore because you are literally destroying our country.
[00:53:20.212 --> 00:53:29.450]   I just had a daughter last month my first child and I'm Very afraid for the world that she's going to be growing up in.
[00:53:30.291 --> 00:53:38.753]  And so when I'm doing these reports, when I'm investigating this stuff, that's part of what's on my mind is thinking about I'm trying to make this a safer place for my child.
[00:53:38.813 --> 00:53:42.254]  And I know there's a lot of other Americans out there who have kids who are scared about this as well.
[00:53:43.155 --> 00:53:46.516]  And, you know, I've never worn a mask throughout this.
[00:53:48.037 --> 00:53:51.700]  Having researched it and looked into it before, it doesn't work the way they say it does.
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.861]  That's not what masks are for.
[00:53:53.461 --> 00:53:55.562]  And so at this point, it's a sign of submission.
[00:53:56.043 --> 00:54:00.326]  And thinking about it, looking ahead, my daughter will never wear a mask.
[00:54:00.606 --> 00:54:03.107]  I don't want her to grow up in a country where that's what's required.
[00:54:03.368 --> 00:54:09.812]  We'll never show that sign of submission to this authority, this false authority that they're trying to impose on us.
[00:54:10.673 --> 00:54:12.274]  And it's the same with the vaccines.
[00:54:12.414 --> 00:54:15.556]  We're not going to do the COVID vaccines on her because they don't work.
[00:54:16.215 --> 00:54:17.196]  They don't work, Alex.
[00:54:17.216 --> 00:54:17.677]  You know this.
[00:54:17.757 --> 00:54:18.538]  We all know this.
[00:54:19.339 --> 00:54:23.445]  But we've got to put that out there and let people know what's happening.
[00:54:23.505 --> 00:54:25.708]  Otherwise, you know, it's going to be imposed.
[00:54:25.728 --> 00:54:27.610]  It is going to be, you know, COVID-19-84.
[00:54:28.251 --> 00:54:29.172]  And we've got to stop that.
[00:54:30.815 --> 00:54:31.856]  You're absolutely right.
[00:54:31.896 --> 00:54:35.802]   And of course, You have the same views as I do on this crazy world.
[00:54:35.842 --> 00:54:39.484]  You've written a book, The Sovereign, available on Amazon.com.
[00:54:39.504 --> 00:54:46.048]  You're working on the next three books in the series and plotting your escape with your family from the big city to a little cabin in the woods.
[00:54:46.108 --> 00:54:50.851]  Brother, that is exactly where we all want to go, away from the New World Order.
[00:54:51.472 --> 00:54:57.135]  I want to get into COVID and the lies and what's coming out and where you see things going and the big stories you're working on when we come back.
[00:54:57.195 --> 00:55:06.960]   But first off, for Pearson Sharp at OAN, gut level, Why do you think it is the people that worship power in Hollywood or worship power in DC or New York?
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:08.641]  They think we're like them.
[00:55:09.101 --> 00:55:12.883]  They think we're trying to overthrow them to get their positions of power.
[00:55:13.203 --> 00:55:15.365]  When they don't understand, we just want away from them.
[00:55:15.665 --> 00:55:18.106]  We're only involved in politics to get them off our backs.
[00:55:20.207 --> 00:55:21.248]  We want to be left alone.
[00:55:21.528 --> 00:55:22.809]  That is the biggest thing.
[00:55:22.829 --> 00:55:29.433]  I think people like you, people like me, most Americans, we just want to be left alone.
[00:55:30.225 --> 00:55:32.045]  Do whatever crazy stuff you want to do.
[00:55:32.585 --> 00:55:35.706]  That's fine, but leave us the hell alone.
[00:55:36.546 --> 00:55:52.429]  My wife and I have been talking, you know, we're stuck in San Diego right now, you know, the commie-fornia, and we'd love to get to a freer state, but in the meantime, we've got to fight back, and these people, they... It is a power trip for them.
[00:55:52.469 --> 00:55:56.390]  It doesn't matter that we want to be left alone.
[00:55:56.410 --> 00:55:57.810]  They can't stand that.
[00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:04.948]   The government I think all governments hate independent, self-sufficient citizens because they can't control them.
[00:56:07.839 --> 00:56:12.781]  I don't know, you can't really call it a hobby, but one of my biggest passions and interests is what's happening in Tibet.
[00:56:12.881 --> 00:56:16.102]  I don't know why, I've just been always fascinated by Tibet and the culture and the history.
[00:56:16.922 --> 00:56:22.924]  And watching what China has done to them, you see that reflected, starting to be reflected here in the United States.
[00:56:23.504 --> 00:56:31.047]  And that's terrifying, because there are nomads in Tibet that just wanted the plains, they have for thousands of years, and they hurt nobody.
[00:56:31.167 --> 00:56:34.388]  They're out mining their business, just living their nomadic lifestyle.
[00:56:35.328 --> 00:56:41.851]  The Chinese goon squads go out and round them up from the countryside and force them to live in poverty in the cities.
[00:56:41.871 --> 00:56:43.352]  And I think that's what the goal is here.
[00:56:43.692 --> 00:56:46.554]  They're trying to put all of us into these cities.
[00:56:46.574 --> 00:56:48.695]  They're trying to put all of us where they can keep an eye on us.
[00:56:48.735 --> 00:56:51.916]  They're trying to just clamp down on all of our freedoms.
[00:56:51.956 --> 00:56:53.677]  And it's never been about leaving us alone.
[00:56:53.837 --> 00:56:54.257]  That's right.
[00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:57.459]  It's all about the board, because they'll farm us.
[00:56:57.639 --> 00:57:04.222]  Big government, big corporations farm us, and so they can't expand their money, their power, unless we submit to them.
[00:57:04.603 --> 00:57:05.223]  It has a name.
[00:57:05.283 --> 00:57:06.383]  It's called slavery.
[00:57:06.724 --> 00:57:09.585]  We're going to come back and go wherever Pearson Sharpe wants to go.
[00:57:09.605 --> 00:57:13.747]  In fact, he's got another one of those badass monologues that's right up there with Tucker Carlson.
[00:57:13.987 --> 00:57:15.628]  We'll let him just take the show over here today.
[00:57:15.908 --> 00:57:16.629]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:16.649 --> 00:57:17.089]  Stay with us.
[00:57:18.487 --> 00:57:19.728]  Welcome to the Infowar.
[00:57:19.888 --> 00:57:30.777]  All right, one of the most truthful, hardcore interviewers, analyst, but his opening monologues like Tucker Carlson does is right up there at the top.
[00:57:31.278 --> 00:57:32.659]  Pearson Sharpe is here.
[00:57:33.219 --> 00:57:37.162]  Pearson, you're an investigative journalist for One American News, but you're a really interesting fellow.
[00:57:37.182 --> 00:57:38.103]  We want to know about you.
[00:57:38.544 --> 00:57:39.965]  You cover international conflicts.
[00:57:40.585 --> 00:57:45.690]  And does on-the-ground reporting around the world, from migration crisis to Sweden to the war in Syria.
[00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:48.092]  And you're an author and a father and a husband.
[00:57:48.512 --> 00:57:53.036]  Spend a few minutes on you to introduce yourself to the audience, because you never talk about yourself on air.
[00:57:53.436 --> 00:58:00.102]  And then we want to drill into the wheels coming off with the whole COVID narrative and suddenly, oh, you don't need masks, you don't need shots.
[00:58:00.382 --> 00:58:04.866]  I think they really realized they woke up a sleeping giant and pissed us off and want us to go back to sleep.
[00:58:04.886 --> 00:58:06.828]  But first, tell us a little bit about yourself.
[00:58:08.644 --> 00:58:09.705]  I hope they realize that.
[00:58:09.905 --> 00:58:10.865]  I hope it's not too late.
[00:58:12.005 --> 00:58:22.590]  So for me, I was raised in Ohio, grew up in Ohio, little country kid, and I came to the big city after a few years, traveled around the world.
[00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:29.993]  I lived in China for a year, which probably shaped a lot of my worldviews more than just about anything.
[00:58:30.738 --> 00:58:39.640]  And I can talk about that later, but it's definitely been one of the biggest warning signs to me as an American having experienced what is happening over there.
[00:58:41.641 --> 00:58:44.561]  Firstly, I'm not a hardcore news junkie.
[00:58:44.921 --> 00:58:54.704]  You know, I come to work and I'm passionate about this, but when I go home, you know, I hang out with my wife and we watch old Star Trek reruns, Next Generation, and just, you know, we're both kind of nerds.
[00:58:55.324 --> 00:59:11.731]   And yeah, but we both feel passionate about this and I think it's important that people do this, that people talk about what's happening, because if we don't, we're going to lose it.
[00:59:13.352 --> 00:59:17.832]   One of the biggest events in my life as a journalist, I think, was when I went to Syria.
[00:59:17.832 --> 00:59:26.791]   And the situation over there, I think, has a lot of ramifications and implications for what we're
[00:59:26.791 --> 00:59:32.871]   seeing today in Russia and in Ukraine and pretty much anywhere in the world. The U.S. is
[00:59:32.918 --> 00:59:33.478]  is involved.
[00:59:33.918 --> 00:59:35.238]  Talking about proxy wars.
[00:59:36.439 --> 00:59:39.760]  Talking about proxy wars but also talking about media misinformation.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:54.293]   And what I mean by that is when I went to Syria I was actually talking to the people who live there, talking to the residents, talking to the citizens in the city where they say the gas attack happened.
[00:59:54.714 --> 00:59:57.416]  And everybody I talked to, everybody I talked to said it didn't happen.
[00:59:57.916 --> 00:59:59.837]  And I was there with a couple of other news agencies.
[00:59:59.918 --> 01:00:02.339]  Reuters was the one that comes to my mind.
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:08.244]  And there was a woman there from Reuters, and she talked to the exact same people that I talked to.
[01:00:08.584 --> 01:00:14.188]  I watched her, because we went around in the alleged bomb zone, the crime area.
[01:00:15.107 --> 01:00:22.337]  And when we got back to our trucks, you know, she had a van there where she was broadcasting back to Reuters and I could hear her dictating.
[01:00:23.198 --> 01:00:28.725]  And after talking to the same people that I talked to, who said nothing happened.
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:39.343]  She went on to give this about five minute explanation to her producer, whoever, about how the citizens there were just terrified and the gas had been overwhelming and that, you know, Assad was going to kill them.
[01:00:39.383 --> 01:00:45.626]  And it was just it was a breathtaking spectacle to see how these people were surviving this terrible tragedy of what he had done to them.
[01:00:45.766 --> 01:00:46.066]  I'm just.
[01:00:48.147 --> 01:00:49.087]  My mind was blown.
[01:00:49.587 --> 01:00:51.468]  How is this happening?
[01:00:51.548 --> 01:00:53.789]  And you realize that they're not reporting the news.
[01:00:53.949 --> 01:00:54.749]  I mean, we all know that.
[01:00:54.769 --> 01:00:57.570]  But then when you actually see it happening right in front of you.
[01:00:58.311 --> 01:01:04.613]  It's astonishing the levels that they will go to to try and conceal and cover up and inveigle the truth.
[01:01:04.853 --> 01:01:06.353]  And by the way, why don't you recap that?
[01:01:06.393 --> 01:01:13.175]  Because I remember several times they said that Assad launched nerve gas, but then the jihadis couldn't help themselves.
[01:01:13.215 --> 01:01:16.136]  They wanted the money they'd get from showing they'd launched it.
[01:01:16.156 --> 01:01:18.477]  So they were putting videos out bragging they'd launched it.
[01:01:19.517 --> 01:01:26.324]  Then the blue helmets and the white helmets and the rest of them got caught staging events and the little kids that didn't really die went on TV.
[01:01:26.404 --> 01:01:27.726]  These were confirmed false flags.
[01:01:27.986 --> 01:01:32.471]  But you were there behind the curtain when it was going on before it even got pulled back.
[01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.390]  Right.
[01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:38.932]  And yeah, those kids said that they were offered candy to, you know, go on and talk about this.
[01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:43.215]  And I talked to the doctors in the hospitals who were down there, and they said, yeah, we didn't see anything.
[01:01:43.235 --> 01:01:44.655]  It was a normal day.
[01:01:44.916 --> 01:01:45.796]  No, no issues.
[01:01:46.076 --> 01:01:46.877]  People came in.
[01:01:46.957 --> 01:01:52.279]  The white helmets and the terrorists rushed in and said that they were, they were finding this, you know, gas attack.
[01:01:52.299 --> 01:01:54.981]  These people were hurt, but they didn't see any injuries.
[01:01:55.121 --> 01:01:56.702]  And these are the doctors that I was talking to.
[01:01:58.207 --> 01:02:08.394]  Um so yeah it was and it was a false flag and these terrorists were putting that message out there so that not necessarily so they could get money although they were getting I think 500 million dollars.
[01:02:08.794 --> 01:02:28.548]   Rand Paul even talked about that from the CIA every year in weapons and arms and all that kind of stuff uh but they were doing it to escape the country because Assad had them cornered and so I feel like that's I'm not in Ukraine, I'm not in Russia right now, but after having seen that, you start to see telltale signs that we're over there meddling again.
[01:02:28.568 --> 01:02:29.749]  That's what we do.
[01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:32.350]  We have bases all over that area.
[01:02:32.410 --> 01:02:37.492]  We have bases in the Black Sea, we have ships, we have weapons and vehicles and everything over there.
[01:02:39.128 --> 01:02:40.909]  Russia is the antagonist, somehow.
[01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:53.699]  So, I mean, if you flipped it around, if Russia had bases in Mexico, in Tijuana, and they had ships patrolling Baja, California, and, you know, the Gulf of Mexico, that would be World War III.
[01:02:53.779 --> 01:02:56.300]  You know, we would attack them immediately.
[01:02:56.701 --> 01:03:00.083]  But when it's us doing it, you know, they're the aggressor.
[01:03:00.263 --> 01:03:02.105]  And that seems to be the narrative that the U.S.
[01:03:02.145 --> 01:03:02.845]  pushes these days.
[01:03:02.905 --> 01:03:05.207]  And the war hawks on both sides just go along with it.
[01:03:05.507 --> 01:03:06.368]  Well, absolutely.
[01:03:07.887 --> 01:03:13.689]  When anybody comes out and says, we don't want war with Russia, again, you get called a Russian agent.
[01:03:14.189 --> 01:03:18.090]  But then meanwhile, it's actually the Democrats that have been paid off by the Russians in many cases.
[01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:20.611]  So everything they accuse us of is the opposite.
[01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:26.453]  Almost 80% of Americans, as you know, in national polls don't want a war with Russia or an escalation in conflict.
[01:03:27.493 --> 01:03:29.074]  Are they all on the Russian payroll?
[01:03:29.454 --> 01:03:31.175]  No, they're sick of this garbage.
[01:03:33.055 --> 01:03:34.496]  They absolutely are sick of this garbage.
[01:03:36.661 --> 01:03:47.544]  My biggest concern is, you know, with them doing this is it does seem like it's leading up to Biden has just an absolute crisis on his hands here with everything going on.
[01:03:48.364 --> 01:03:50.604]  And is that was my next question.
[01:03:50.884 --> 01:03:52.845]  How does Biden, how do the globalists get out of this?
[01:03:52.885 --> 01:03:54.145]  Cause they stole the election.
[01:03:54.165 --> 01:03:55.566]  They put in a geriatric corpse.
[01:03:56.086 --> 01:03:57.966]  He's got probably a 30% approval rating.
[01:03:57.986 --> 01:03:59.006]  We know they've tried to prop him up.
[01:03:59.447 --> 01:03:59.827]  They claim 38%.
[01:04:00.147 --> 01:04:01.327]  I mean, what are they going to do?
[01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:03.407]  Much less than that.
[01:04:03.767 --> 01:04:06.128]  Well, I think we're seeing what they're going to do.
[01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:10.271]  They've already got a blueprint that it worked great last time.
[01:04:10.451 --> 01:04:13.653]  You unleash a virus and then you can control the elections.
[01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:15.313]  They've got hammer and scorecard.
[01:04:15.414 --> 01:04:16.834]  We know that from back in the day.
[01:04:17.155 --> 01:04:18.315]  That worked pretty well for them.
[01:04:18.936 --> 01:04:24.659]  So I think right now what we're seeing with Russia is probably more to do with Biden's numbers than anything else.
[01:04:25.379 --> 01:04:27.601]  And that's, I mean... I agree.
[01:04:27.621 --> 01:04:31.463]  This is their October surprise is trying to start a war with Russia, which is insane.
[01:04:33.046 --> 01:04:33.887]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:04:33.967 --> 01:04:35.790]  And they've done it before and it always seems to work.
[01:04:37.814 --> 01:04:41.256]  A lot of us know that it's bogus, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.
[01:04:41.797 --> 01:04:42.997]  War is good for ratings.
[01:04:43.298 --> 01:04:44.999]  We've seen that throughout U.S.
[01:04:45.019 --> 01:04:45.439]  history.
[01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:48.481]  You know, whenever you're falling in the polls, just unleash a war.
[01:04:48.501 --> 01:04:49.181]  I worked for Bush.
[01:04:49.542 --> 01:04:50.582]  He did a great job with that.
[01:04:51.883 --> 01:04:52.784]  But this is Russia.
[01:04:52.804 --> 01:04:53.564]  This isn't Iraq.
[01:04:53.584 --> 01:05:00.969]  So imagine, we'll all have really big ratings when the first nukes go off in Europe, and then we'll have 10 minutes of tens of millions tuning in before we die.
[01:05:00.989 --> 01:05:04.811]  That's called suicide journalism.
[01:05:04.851 --> 01:05:05.812]  I mean, it's just dumb.
[01:05:07.483 --> 01:05:14.649]  Well, it is, but they're not thinking that far ahead, and they don't... We know, Alex, we know at this point, and they've demonstrated it.
[01:05:15.850 --> 01:05:16.791]  There are so many examples.
[01:05:17.131 --> 01:05:19.473]  They do not care about us.
[01:05:19.753 --> 01:05:21.815]  They do not care what happens to us.
[01:05:22.115 --> 01:05:23.236]  The less of us, the better.
[01:05:23.416 --> 01:05:24.937]  I mean, Bill Gates has come out and said that.
[01:05:25.037 --> 01:05:29.841]  Exactly, that's what a famous Chinese Communist leader said, is, I don't care if we kill 50 million Chinese, we got too many.
[01:05:30.121 --> 01:05:31.443]  We'll be right back with Pearson Sharpe.
[01:05:31.463 --> 01:05:31.823]  Stay with us.
[01:05:33.424 --> 01:05:37.712]   But when they think, The very nation itself should be dissolved.
[01:05:37.792 --> 01:05:38.533]  They are enemies.
[01:05:40.053 --> 01:05:42.515]  And that's why the globalists tell you, you're a Nazi.
[01:05:44.636 --> 01:05:46.057]  You're a Russian agent.
[01:05:47.745 --> 01:05:51.769]  You're all these preposterous things because they're the ones that are the globalists.
[01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:53.230]  They're the ones that are the outsiders.
[01:05:53.731 --> 01:05:54.972]  They are the people taking over.
[01:05:55.032 --> 01:05:56.893]  They are the usurpers.
[01:05:56.913 --> 01:06:09.185]  And I want to talk about communist China and Pelosi and all the NBA owners endorsing the Uyghur genocide and the rest of it with our special guest here, Pearson Sharpe of OAN.
[01:06:10.366 --> 01:06:23.452]   And he's here with us right now, but I wanted to hit Some of the really big news, and before I hit the stories I want to get your take on, what do you think the big takeaway right now on this worldwide biomedical tyranny is?
[01:06:23.932 --> 01:06:28.214]  What do you think the biggest story is right now concerning all the huge developments?
[01:06:30.175 --> 01:06:40.280]  Well, one thing, and it kind of leads into that, you mentioned the globalist wanting to dissolve our country, and that ties into the big biotech war that we're facing right now.
[01:06:40.952 --> 01:06:45.992]   is from the Bible, Ephesians 6.12. I'm not sure if you're familiar with that.
[01:06:45.992 --> 01:06:52.152]   I am. But it says, "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers,
[01:06:52.152 --> 01:06:55.992]   against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world."
[01:06:55.992 --> 01:06:59.032]  Against the powers and principalities of the air.
[01:06:59.032 --> 01:07:02.552]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:07:02.722 --> 01:07:03.523]  Read that again.
[01:07:03.683 --> 01:07:04.424]  Read that again.
[01:07:05.345 --> 01:07:12.373]  What the Bible's saying is there's evil entities manipulating humans above this and a fallen group on the planet that wants to lead us towards this.
[01:07:12.393 --> 01:07:13.875]  People say, well, that's 2,000 years ago.
[01:07:14.195 --> 01:07:15.416]  It's now being fulfilled.
[01:07:15.757 --> 01:07:17.499]  Read that Ephesians quote again, please.
[01:07:19.381 --> 01:07:32.188]  Our struggle is not against the flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.
[01:07:33.068 --> 01:07:34.589]  And that says it all.
[01:07:34.769 --> 01:07:36.390]  That says exactly what we're facing right now.
[01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:37.110]  Alien attack.
[01:07:40.252 --> 01:07:44.814]  And we see the globalists operating like they're not human, like they just hate everything about humans.
[01:07:45.034 --> 01:07:45.755]  Transhumanism.
[01:07:45.775 --> 01:07:46.515]  What's your view on that?
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:50.261]  Transhumanism.
[01:07:51.243 --> 01:07:54.689]  I'm not super familiar with that concept, Alex.
[01:07:55.270 --> 01:08:00.619]  Well, that's basically the globalist saying we've got to give up our humanity and that humans are failed and we've got to merge with machines.
[01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:05.331]  Well, I mean that makes perfect sense.
[01:08:06.772 --> 01:08:17.759]  They want to destroy everything that's human about us and we see that in everything they're doing with the injections to dehumanizing us, keeping us at home, not allowed to talk to people, not allowed to see our family members in the hospitals who are dying.
[01:08:18.099 --> 01:08:20.961]  They want to destroy everything and erode everything that makes us human.
[01:08:21.001 --> 01:08:23.363]  They hate, you know, the nuclear family.
[01:08:23.383 --> 01:08:34.159]   I go home to my wife at night and we sit there with our daughter and you just It sparks something inside of you.
[01:08:34.179 --> 01:08:39.304]  You just feel this warmth, and this happiness, and this contentment, and you know this is what it's about.
[01:08:39.424 --> 01:08:42.067]  Your family, God, and being together.
[01:08:42.207 --> 01:08:44.069]  This is what it's about, and it feels good.
[01:08:44.429 --> 01:08:47.332]  And you know that that just drives them nuts.
[01:08:47.352 --> 01:08:54.719]  They hate that because everything they're doing is trying to destroy that feeling, and that togetherness, and that closeness, that family unit.
[01:08:55.119 --> 01:08:57.422]  They've been trying to destroy it since the 50s, you know.
[01:08:57.442 --> 01:09:00.360]   This is a This is an ongoing war against what makes us human.
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:02.961]  And they're getting closer and closer to their end goal.
[01:09:02.961 --> 01:09:08.881]   But like you said before I came on, they're in panic mode right now
[01:09:08.881 --> 01:09:11.981]  because we are pushing back and we're pushing back hard.
[01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:14.282]  And I don't think they expected it to go this way for them.
[01:09:14.282 --> 01:09:16.400]  They thought it was gonna be a little bit easier.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:21.881]   The thing that scares me though, that worries me is we are pushing back,
[01:09:21.881 --> 01:09:25.601]   but the American people, you know, we're supposed to be the cowboys.
[01:09:25.466 --> 01:09:28.810]  We're supposed to be the rebels and the renegades and the revolutionaries.
[01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:35.599]  But throughout the last two years, we have just shown a shocking tolerance.
[01:09:36.417 --> 01:09:43.480]  This kind of oppression and this tyranny and we just go along with it and bend over and accept what they're saying and I didn't expect that.
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:46.281]  I thought we were going to have more of a backbone and push back.
[01:09:46.581 --> 01:09:48.322]  Now, we're not like New Zealand.
[01:09:48.742 --> 01:09:50.163]  We're not like England.
[01:09:50.223 --> 01:09:52.204]  You know, we haven't been pushed that far.
[01:09:52.244 --> 01:09:55.125]  I think the only reason that's happened is because we have guns and they don't.
[01:09:55.928 --> 01:09:58.050]  But they're doing everything they can to get rid of those as well.
[01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:59.591]  I totally agree with you.
[01:09:59.611 --> 01:10:05.916]  So why do you think they're suddenly claiming, okay, we're going to back off the mask, we're going to back off forced injection for now.
[01:10:05.936 --> 01:10:10.720]  I think that's because they see that finally people see them and they push too far.
[01:10:10.780 --> 01:10:11.941]  They hope we go back to sleep.
[01:10:14.163 --> 01:10:14.503]  They do.
[01:10:14.864 --> 01:10:15.684]  They absolutely do.
[01:10:15.905 --> 01:10:16.845]  They have pushed too far.
[01:10:17.426 --> 01:10:19.768]  But I wonder what is going to be the sparking point?
[01:10:19.908 --> 01:10:24.808]   What is going to be The Boston Massacre of our generation.
[01:10:24.848 --> 01:10:27.329]  What is going to be the Flintstone that sets this off?
[01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:47.357]  And the other thing that worries me, and I'd like to get your take on this, is when we do push back, and we push back hard enough, I'm concerned that whether it's Biden or Kamala or whoever it is, someone in Washington is going to say, look, this is too much for us to handle.
[01:10:48.478 --> 01:10:49.098]  Hey, China!
[01:10:49.744 --> 01:10:50.845]  You want to help us out here?
[01:10:50.925 --> 01:10:53.404]  You're good at putting down riots and oppressing people.
[01:10:53.404 --> 01:10:54.404]  Why don't you come on in?
[01:10:54.404 --> 01:10:55.404]  Oh, that's what I've been getting accused to.
[01:10:55.404 --> 01:10:56.804]  Oh, the UN's running our border.
[01:10:56.804 --> 01:10:59.925]  Oh, the UN's overseeing our police.
[01:10:59.925 --> 01:11:02.404]  Oh, that's a great question.
[01:11:02.381 --> 01:11:04.503]  How are they going to try to continue their control?
[01:11:04.523 --> 01:11:06.905]  Because an abuser doesn't give up, they just double down.
[01:11:07.645 --> 01:11:14.951]  Pearson, I would say that it's going to be a cyber attack that they launch themselves, that they blame on a Patriot group or somebody else or the Russians.
[01:11:15.412 --> 01:11:17.173]  I think blackouts is what they're going to do.
[01:11:17.454 --> 01:11:21.537]  If we really start winning and really start removing them peacefully, they're going to turn the power off.
[01:11:23.539 --> 01:11:24.199]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:24.700]  Yeah.
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.424]  EMPs, whatever it takes, they're going to disable us so we can't fight back and then there's going to be mass starvation.
[01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:52.327]  Back to my point, I'm legitimately concerned that it could be a very real possibility that we have an initially soft invasion from China, where Washington rolls out the welcome mat, and we have Chinese peacekeepers coming over and filling our streets, to a hard invasion, where there is no rebellion against Washington anymore, but we're just fighting an outright war against China on our own doorstep.
[01:11:53.308 --> 01:11:59.331]  Well, that's right, and no one would believe that would happen, but the left is like, do not fight the Chinese peacekeepers or you're a racist.
[01:12:00.251 --> 01:12:01.151]  And that's basically it.
[01:12:01.171 --> 01:12:05.753]  They're going to try to, like, trick black folks and others to, quote, join the CHICOMs in the UN.
[01:12:06.093 --> 01:12:09.314]  It would be CHICOM, which already makes up two thirds of the UN peacekeeping force.
[01:12:09.694 --> 01:12:13.895]  It'd be CHICOMs under the UN helmet, but it would be majority Chinese troops.
[01:12:13.935 --> 01:12:14.095]  Yeah.
[01:12:16.016 --> 01:12:19.256]  One thing I like, I've been thinking about this and it worries me.
[01:12:19.296 --> 01:12:20.677]  I wanted to get your opinion on this, too.
[01:12:22.057 --> 01:12:24.438]  Where we're at now, how bad things have gotten.
[01:12:25.198 --> 01:12:30.730]   Do you think that we can have Can we recover from where we are?
[01:12:30.770 --> 01:12:33.713]  Can we have a peaceful recovery from where we are?
[01:12:33.773 --> 01:12:37.396]  Because everything I'm seeing, it looks like the democratic process has failed.
[01:12:37.596 --> 01:12:38.757]  Negotiations have failed.
[01:12:39.457 --> 01:12:46.057]   And I hate to think that a revolution is the only answer, but I don't see these people ever giving up power
[01:12:46.057 --> 01:12:46.896]  or backing down.
[01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:47.736]  Well, I'll tell you why.
[01:12:47.736 --> 01:12:53.056]   It's 'cause the George Soros's and the British royalty and the rest of them, they feel insulated and protected.
[01:12:53.056 --> 01:12:56.457]   They feel like the public doesn't know how they fund Bilderberg or Davos.
[01:12:56.457 --> 01:12:59.655]   They feel like when Prince Charles says, "We need a global military action
[01:12:59.655 --> 01:13:03.537]   "against the humans to save the earth, "and we need more money than all the money in the earth
[01:13:03.537 --> 01:13:06.617]  "to bring in the new green deal, which is depopulation."
[01:13:06.617 --> 01:13:10.577]   He thinks when he goes and speaks at a UN meeting, no one's paying attention to that.
[01:13:10.577 --> 01:13:15.657]   But instead of 1% knowing about it 20 years ago, maybe 20% know now.
[01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:19.017]  Well, 20% can wake up 40%, can wake up 60%.
[01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:22.443]  So it may take, let me show people a graph right here, just out of my mind.
[01:13:22.884 --> 01:13:24.545]  You know, let's say this is 1990, okay?
[01:13:24.625 --> 01:13:25.706]  And 1% are awake.
[01:13:25.746 --> 01:13:26.947]  And then let's move to 2022.
[01:13:26.987 --> 01:13:31.330]  So let's say 1% are awake here.
[01:13:31.150 --> 01:13:40.509]   percent are awake and then let's move to 20, 22. So let's say 1% are awake here and then
[01:13:40.509 --> 01:13:46.630]   it goes up and suddenly it's 20% in 2021, 2022 it's maybe 30%.
[01:13:47.210 --> 01:13:51.592]  This is what scares them because once awakenings hit, they go parabolic.
[01:13:52.472 --> 01:13:53.553]  Okay, so it's exponential.
[01:13:53.873 --> 01:13:55.214]  So we're basically right here.
[01:13:56.214 --> 01:13:58.895]  They know that okay, they got 25-30% right now.
[01:14:00.848 --> 01:14:01.689]  What are we going to do?
[01:14:02.169 --> 01:14:06.852]  And that's why they're starting wars and getting us ready, because they want to try to shut that off no matter what.
[01:14:07.352 --> 01:14:14.817]  And the question is, can we educate people enough to understand, to let the globalists know you're not going to get away with this, just give in to the revolution, give in to the new renaissance.
[01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:16.338]  That's the point right there.
[01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:19.249]  Yeah, I think you're absolutely right.
[01:14:19.469 --> 01:14:31.794]  And one of the terrifying things, you mentioned this I think the other day on your show, we've got 55 federal agencies who are now tracking people who are objecting to these vaccines, who are putting in religious objections and stuff like that.
[01:14:32.294 --> 01:14:33.374]  They're tracking these people.
[01:14:33.674 --> 01:14:34.995]  The DHS has a list.
[01:14:35.255 --> 01:14:36.175]  They're tracking people.
[01:14:36.495 --> 01:14:41.997]  The Department of the Treasury actually will track and maintain information about religious beliefs.
[01:14:42.637 --> 01:14:43.898]  That's right, unprecedented.
[01:14:43.978 --> 01:14:45.658]  Pearson Sharpe of OAN, stay there.
[01:14:45.878 --> 01:14:47.599]  Let's come right back and talk about this key issue.
[01:14:49.076 --> 01:14:56.160]  I just went into the break room to get a cup of coffee and there was the great Pearson Sharp on OAN, knocking it out of the park.
[01:14:56.721 --> 01:14:58.862]  Final segment with him, I really appreciate him joining us today.
[01:14:59.462 --> 01:15:02.905]  Must watch Wednesday broadcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:03.725 --> 01:15:09.709]  Pfizer warns shareholders to brace for unfavorable clinical safety data.
[01:15:11.448 --> 01:15:17.493]  Meanwhile, the CDC has announced that it's set to release new guidance saying don't take shots too close.
[01:15:17.933 --> 01:15:23.258]  Together they can cause blood clots or heart attacks, myocarditis and death.
[01:15:24.078 --> 01:15:26.140]  Pearson Sharp, you got cut off by the break.
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:30.644]  You were getting into some really important areas concerning all this medical tyranny.
[01:15:30.984 --> 01:15:33.486]  What was that point you wanted to hit that I'm going to ask you about these new stories?
[01:15:35.538 --> 01:15:56.385]  Well, we just found out a couple days ago that there are 55 federal agencies, including five cabinet-level agencies, who are now tracking Americans and employees, specifically of them, the Treasury Department, even the military, tracking employees who have objections to the vaccine, who apply for an exemption or something, and who don't want to get it.
[01:15:56.785 --> 01:15:57.905]  They're tracking these people.
[01:15:58.305 --> 01:16:00.206]  And you better believe they're watching them closely.
[01:16:00.226 --> 01:16:03.347]  They're basically, what this is, is curating a list of enemies of the state.
[01:16:04.341 --> 01:16:07.564]  And what's terrifying is that we've seen this before.
[01:16:08.504 --> 01:16:11.427]  All of this has happened before.
[01:16:11.647 --> 01:16:24.857]  In 1930s Germany, IBM created a database of Jewish people in Europe, which really greatly facilitated the Nazi Germany government going after the Jews in their country.
[01:16:25.337 --> 01:16:27.239]  And now I feel like that's what we're seeing here.
[01:16:27.719 --> 01:16:33.063]  They're going after red-blooded Americans who are standing up for their country and don't want to be a part of this genocide.
[01:16:33.683 --> 01:16:36.305]  They're tracking them, and we know where this leads.
[01:16:36.805 --> 01:16:37.286]  Well, that's right.
[01:16:37.306 --> 01:16:48.594]  This is all, if you had a list of like a hundred things that tyrants would do, and like Hitler did 60, and Stalin did 50, and Mao did 75, you know, they've done like a hundred.
[01:16:49.034 --> 01:16:54.838]  I mean, they're going down every thing a tyrant would do, and they're checking the box off.
[01:16:54.858 --> 01:17:00.182]  I mean, tracker chips in all the cars by law, just completely insane.
[01:17:00.502 --> 01:17:03.244]  What do you make of the new story that broke just last night?
[01:17:04.085 --> 01:17:05.406]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:17:05.826 --> 01:17:06.826]  Zero Hedge has it.
[01:17:07.247 --> 01:17:16.151]  Pfizer quietly adds language warning that unfavorable preclinical, clinical, or safety data may impact business.
[01:17:16.992 --> 01:17:19.533]  Off all those documents, federal courts order them a release.
[01:17:19.893 --> 01:17:21.174]  That, to me, is a huge story.
[01:17:22.751 --> 01:17:27.454]  Well, it is a huge story, and we know that they tried with the FDA to delay that.
[01:17:27.534 --> 01:17:29.916]  First, by 55 years, delay their safety data.
[01:17:30.196 --> 01:17:35.520]  Then, by 75 years, they tried to prevent this information from getting out to the public.
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:42.064]  Almost the year 2100, we'd be finding out what happened, long after all the people involved were dead or, you know, couldn't be arrested anymore.
[01:17:42.484 --> 01:17:50.070]  So they are terrified of what's going to get out, and they're hoping that we don't figure it out in time, or they can just figure out a way to blame it on something else.
[01:17:50.331 --> 01:17:55.755]  I don't know if you saw, they said that actually all these side effects that we're experiencing from the vaccine, it's all placebo.
[01:17:55.815 --> 01:17:56.516]  It's all in our head.
[01:17:56.856 --> 01:17:58.277]  It's not actually from the vaccine.
[01:17:58.557 --> 01:18:04.462]  We've just been reading right-wing conspiracy theories, and now we're suffering myocarditis because we've read those conspiracy theories.
[01:18:04.562 --> 01:18:19.115]  For those that don't know, the Daily Mail, the London Guardian, the Associated Press, they're all reporting the heart attacks are exploding because of the fear of COVID and the lockdowns when, no, the inserts on the shots say it causes it.
[01:18:20.447 --> 01:18:21.127]  Right, exactly.
[01:18:21.147 --> 01:18:22.068]  The FDA knows it.
[01:18:22.088 --> 01:18:23.229]  They put warning labels on it.
[01:18:23.489 --> 01:18:24.870]  Moderna put warning labels on it.
[01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:25.670]  Pfizer has admitted it.
[01:18:25.690 --> 01:18:28.052]  We all know that this causes heart failures.
[01:18:28.472 --> 01:18:36.997]  We're seeing a 500% increase in deaths from athletes, from soccer players, just dropping dead on the field from one year ago.
[01:18:37.017 --> 01:18:43.381]  I mean, what kind of smooth brain inbred do you have to be to not see what's actually happening here?
[01:18:44.730 --> 01:18:48.334]  And that goes back to them now suddenly saying, OK, we don't have to wear the mask.
[01:18:48.494 --> 01:18:50.416]  OK, no forced inoculations.
[01:18:50.857 --> 01:18:53.099]  But then they actually move forward with the same policy.
[01:18:53.159 --> 01:18:56.743]  So they tell us we're winning to make us go to sleep, but they're not stopping.
[01:18:56.963 --> 01:18:57.564]  It's crazy.
[01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:00.251]  Oh, they'll never back down.
[01:19:00.631 --> 01:19:04.775]  And that's what that's what worries me is what we're gonna have to do to get them to back down.
[01:19:06.196 --> 01:19:08.098]  I mentioned earlier, I wanted to talk about China.
[01:19:08.418 --> 01:19:09.479]  I lived there for a year.
[01:19:09.659 --> 01:19:10.720]  Yes, let's talk about China.
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:19.427]  In fact, I had that here, the Olympics and all the dystopic images of power plants and those looks like nuclear smokestacks behind people.
[01:19:19.748 --> 01:19:23.951]  And then the food they're feeding people is literally worse than supermax prison stuff.
[01:19:23.991 --> 01:19:24.632]  What's going on here?
[01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:27.118]  Oh my god, yeah.
[01:19:27.258 --> 01:19:28.619]  It's China.
[01:19:29.179 --> 01:19:32.020]  Astonishingly, China is the end goal for Globalist.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:36.321]  They want everything to be like that, where everyone is just totally controlled and cowed into submission.
[01:19:37.261 --> 01:19:44.143]  When I was over there, I was a teacher at Shucheng University, which is in central China, about 12 hours west of Beijing.
[01:19:45.043 --> 01:19:48.884]  And it was a town of about 4 million people, which is considered small over there.
[01:19:49.704 --> 01:19:50.945]  And my students were really nice.
[01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:58.743]   But I've never met a more indoctrinated group of people in my life, and it was everybody.
[01:19:59.424 --> 01:20:12.568]   Everybody you would run into was just... It's difficult to explain To someone in the West, the difference in behavior between a Chinese national and an American.
[01:20:12.628 --> 01:20:15.931]  And this is a total cultural thing before anyone jumps to racism.
[01:20:16.352 --> 01:20:19.135]  Because you talk to people from Hong Kong, and it's night and day.
[01:20:19.155 --> 01:20:19.876]  They're like Americans.
[01:20:19.896 --> 01:20:21.978]  You talk to people from Taiwan, they're like Americans.
[01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:23.119]  They understand what freedom is.
[01:20:23.199 --> 01:20:27.043]  This is three generations under communism, and they're like Martians.
[01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.730]  They are.
[01:20:28.830 --> 01:20:30.091]  They absolutely are like Martians.
[01:20:30.931 --> 01:20:44.575]  They are totally obedient, they don't question anything, and they have a concept over there called saving face, where you know the person you're talking to is lying, they know you know that they're lying, but you both continue with it because you want to preserve the face.
[01:20:44.935 --> 01:20:47.356]  And that interaction happens in everything that you do.
[01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:55.258]  I was teaching my students and I saw one student cheating off another, and I called him on it, like I'm watching him, and he said, no I'm not.
[01:20:56.097 --> 01:20:57.399]  I can see you doing it right there.
[01:20:57.419 --> 01:20:57.919]  No, I'm not.
[01:20:57.939 --> 01:21:00.724]  So all they do is just gaslight and just go along.
[01:21:00.744 --> 01:21:06.694]  That's why they have so many disasters, so many plants meltdown, because no one will tell anybody they're wrong.
[01:21:08.116 --> 01:21:08.637]  Exactly.
[01:21:09.082 --> 01:21:10.522]  Yep, it's endemic to their culture.
[01:21:11.603 --> 01:21:13.823]  And that, I'm afraid, is what's going to happen here.
[01:21:13.903 --> 01:21:16.684]  People are just going to buy what's being fed to them.
[01:21:17.004 --> 01:21:22.685]  My students all 100% believed that Taiwan was part of China.
[01:21:23.325 --> 01:21:24.245]  There was no debate about it.
[01:21:24.265 --> 01:21:26.626]  You would get fired from the school if you even questioned that.
[01:21:26.886 --> 01:21:31.867]  And that Tibet had always been part of China and looked at China as its loving mother.
[01:21:32.147 --> 01:21:33.067]  There was no invasion.
[01:21:33.527 --> 01:21:34.727]  They have always been part of China.
[01:21:34.927 --> 01:21:42.209]   In fact, they told me that the Great Wall of China was just built So when you talk about brainwashing, you're saying that's why China's the globalist model.
[01:21:42.048 --> 01:21:43.528]  there was no Mongol invasion.
[01:21:43.528 --> 01:21:44.368]  That never happened.
[01:21:44.368 --> 01:21:46.128]  Genghis Khan was a friend of China.
[01:21:46.128 --> 01:21:48.328]  And they all just solidly believe this.
[01:21:48.328 --> 01:21:50.568]  It's incredible, it's an alternate reality.
[01:21:50.568 --> 01:21:55.088]   So when you talk about brainwashing, you're saying that's why China's the globalist model.
[01:21:55.088 --> 01:21:59.649]   It's a brainwashed population that does whatever they want and goes against reality.
[01:21:59.649 --> 01:22:01.809]  Exactly.
[01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:06.392]  And you can see the hallmarks of what's happening there happening here.
[01:22:06.893 --> 01:22:08.113]  And that's what's very frightening.
[01:22:08.553 --> 01:22:10.274]  The censorship, the oppression.
[01:22:10.654 --> 01:22:14.276]  And our government, they're gaslighting as well.
[01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:21.819]  The DHS just released a statement where they said, we are very concerned about the lack of freedom of speech happening in China right now.
[01:22:22.299 --> 01:22:26.961]  And we think it's just terrible what the Chinese government is doing to their citizens and not allowing them to have free speech.
[01:22:26.981 --> 01:22:29.282]  While they do everything they can to shut us down here.
[01:22:30.239 --> 01:22:32.940]  To shut us down, to shut you down, to shut OAN down.
[01:22:33.321 --> 01:22:45.947]  And we've had people, this is what's terrifying, OAN has actually had people in Congress, politicians, who are sworn to uphold the Constitution, write to AT&T and say, we need to get you off the air.
[01:22:46.327 --> 01:22:48.048]  Like, they're just spreading misinformation.
[01:22:50.429 --> 01:22:56.422]   To be as a society, when you get to that point, when free speech is no longer sacred, It's terrifying.
[01:22:56.462 --> 01:22:57.283]  It's more of the same.
[01:22:57.303 --> 01:22:58.465]  I mean it's not surprising at all.
[01:22:58.505 --> 01:22:59.826]  Like I said before, we know they don't care about us.
[01:22:59.846 --> 01:23:00.887]  They have their agenda.
[01:23:00.728 --> 01:23:04.288]   I don't care about death camps and the attempts to take OAN off the air.
[01:23:04.288 --> 01:23:05.688]  What's your view on that?
[01:23:05.688 --> 01:23:07.646]  Well, it's more of the same.
[01:23:07.646 --> 01:23:09.608]  I mean, it's not surprising at all.
[01:23:09.608 --> 01:23:12.887]  Like I said before, we know they don't care about us.
[01:23:12.887 --> 01:23:13.887]  They have their agenda.
[01:23:13.887 --> 01:23:17.247]  They have their ivory towers.
[01:23:17.247 --> 01:23:21.368]   The secret behind every Democrat is they want to be an aristocrat.
[01:23:21.615 --> 01:23:25.981]  They want to create a new monarchy where they are the elite and everybody else is a peasant.
[01:23:26.682 --> 01:23:29.225]  And so, you know, once they're there, they don't care.
[01:23:29.164 --> 01:23:31.164]  They don't care about what happens to us at all.
[01:23:31.164 --> 01:23:33.164]  So of course they don't care about the Uyghurs.
[01:23:33.164 --> 01:23:35.003]  Doesn't affect them. Doesn't matter.
[01:23:35.003 --> 01:23:36.284]  They don't care what happens to any of us.
[01:23:36.284 --> 01:23:38.284]  It could be it could be Americans if that's happening too.
[01:23:38.284 --> 01:23:40.364]  And as long as it doesn't affect them, you know, it doesn't.
[01:23:41.167 --> 01:23:46.030]  I've had meetings with globalists off record and they go, look, you're an elite, you know all this, join us, screw the general public.
[01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:51.072]  And they literally think I'm attacking the aristocrats, the aristocracy, because I want to be them.
[01:23:51.172 --> 01:23:52.713]  No, I want a renaissance.
[01:23:52.793 --> 01:23:53.853]  I want to empower humanity.
[01:23:54.193 --> 01:23:56.615]  I don't get off on ripping people off and screwing them over.
[01:23:56.855 --> 01:23:58.535]  And then they see me as a weak chump.
[01:23:58.936 --> 01:24:01.637]  But overall, what they create is a nightmare civilization.
[01:24:03.683 --> 01:24:04.383]  Yeah, they do.
[01:24:04.423 --> 01:24:05.223]  And that's the end goal.
[01:24:05.984 --> 01:24:07.284]  It is literally going to look like 1984.
[01:24:07.984 --> 01:24:09.084]  That's their instruction manual.
[01:24:09.465 --> 01:24:11.465]  And we have to fight back.
[01:24:11.725 --> 01:24:12.485]  We have to stand up.
[01:24:12.525 --> 01:24:17.487]  And like I said, I don't know where the powder keg moment is going to be, but they've stretched us so far.
[01:24:17.547 --> 01:24:18.807]  They've pushed us so far.
[01:24:18.827 --> 01:24:20.288]  The rubber band's got to snap.
[01:24:20.508 --> 01:24:21.728]  We can't go much further than this.
[01:24:22.699 --> 01:24:23.220]  That's right.
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:27.463]  Well, I think they plan to snap back and cause a giant revolution that collapses society.
[01:24:27.483 --> 01:24:28.264]  We don't want that to happen either.
[01:24:28.284 --> 01:24:31.147]  That's why we've got to be as wise as serpents and peaceful as doves.
[01:24:31.267 --> 01:24:33.009]  Pearson Sharpe, very impressed with what you do.
[01:24:33.689 --> 01:24:35.511]  Ed Pearson Sharpe on Getter and Twitter.
[01:24:35.951 --> 01:24:36.632]  Thank you so much.
[01:24:36.672 --> 01:24:38.093]  Please come back anytime you want.
[01:24:38.133 --> 01:24:40.716]  If OAN will let you, we'd love you to guest host sometime.
[01:24:40.996 --> 01:24:42.037]  We'd love you to come to Austin.
[01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:42.878]  We love OAN.
[01:24:42.898 --> 01:24:43.779]  Everybody should watch it.
[01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:44.819]  They should share it.
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:46.601]  And word of mouth that just like they do InfoWars.
[01:24:46.961 --> 01:24:48.343]  Thank you so much for all your time today.
[01:24:49.907 --> 01:24:50.248]  Absolutely.
[01:24:50.289 --> 01:24:50.951]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:24:51.191 --> 01:24:55.405]  Truth-tellers are few and far between, so we all appreciate what you're doing.
[01:24:55.545 --> 01:24:56.127]  Appreciate you.
[01:24:57.119 --> 01:25:08.190]  Well, Pearson Sharpe is awesome, and you can find him on OAN, and if he's getting taken off satellite and different systems, well, go find it yourself online at the OAN website and share it, because you can override that tyranny.
[01:25:08.410 --> 01:25:12.534]  They're taking it down because it was exploding, and they can't stand that.
[01:25:12.955 --> 01:25:20.462]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with our number three, with a whistleblower from Australia, from inside Pfizer.
[01:25:20.302 --> 01:25:31.901]  Stay with us.
[01:25:32.469 --> 01:25:34.790]  With the globalists plotting their next big lockdown.
[01:25:35.531 --> 01:25:38.813]  With the next phase of the Great Reset being a staged cyber attack.
[01:25:39.233 --> 01:25:45.297]  With the deep state pushing a civil war, not just here, but in Europe, and war with Russia.
[01:25:45.717 --> 01:25:57.544]  With the massive inflation and all the other garbage that's taking place, like supply chain breakdowns, you need to get prepared now with high quality storable food that is ready to ship.
[01:25:57.984 --> 01:26:06.315]   And it's been four years since my Patriot Supply at preparewithalex.com has offered their storable food at 25% off.
[01:26:06.315 --> 01:26:12.795]   Four years, but right now, it's 25% off until February 13th, 2022.
[01:26:12.795 --> 01:26:19.214]   A little over two weeks from the time I'm cutting this to get 25% off at preparewithalex.com
[01:26:19.214 --> 01:26:22.514]  on the entire catalog of MyPatriotSupply.
[01:26:22.514 --> 01:26:24.595]  Act now, get prepared now.
[01:26:24.595 --> 01:26:28.435]   This is absolutely essential for everybody that wants to be self-sufficient.
[01:26:29.555 --> 01:26:35.155]   All right, Syrian girl lives in Australia and she's worked for Big Pharma
[01:26:35.155 --> 01:26:37.955]  and she was pro-vaccine until she saw what happened there.
[01:26:37.543 --> 01:26:38.923]  She's joining us next segment.
[01:26:39.723 --> 01:26:50.605]  She's got a lot to talk about in Australia, so we're going to get all the clips of the Australian police brutality and arresting old ladies, and the people fighting back now, and all the beautiful stuff that's happening coming up next segment.
[01:26:51.486 --> 01:27:00.987]   But I really want to air this Greg Reif report that needs to get out, because the battle plan you see in Canada being used against the people there, is the battle plan for every other country.
[01:27:01.007 --> 01:27:03.688]  This is big pharma, corporate tyranny.
[01:27:03.988 --> 01:27:06.368]  This is how the cowardly corporations launch their attacks.
[01:27:06.909 --> 01:27:08.289]  So here is that report.
[01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:15.149]  Trudeau deploys globalist police force.
[01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:24.149]   Our government has been in close contact with the mayor of Ottawa, the municipal and provincial officials.
[01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:27.149]  [Music]
[01:27:25.169 --> 01:27:33.015]  So far, the RCMP has mobilized nearly 300 officers to support the Ottawa Police Services and is ready to do more.
[01:27:34.076 --> 01:27:38.960]  Rather than face the Canadian people, Justin Trudeau is seeking his police on them.
[01:27:40.529 --> 01:27:44.450]  Governments have been hiring globalist players and thugs for years.
[01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:48.511]  Meet Peter Slowly, known for being woke.
[01:27:49.452 --> 01:27:57.894]  Seven years ago, as Deputy Police Chief, Peter Slowly said that being black made him a suitable candidate for Toronto's next police chief.
[01:27:58.694 --> 01:28:04.136]  And claimed a more important factor was his experience as a United Nations peacekeeper.
[01:28:04.836 --> 01:28:10.462]  An international police force known for raping and pillaging communities under the flag of peace.
[01:28:11.503 --> 01:28:18.050]  It was reported that there was much animosity when Slowly was not chosen to be Toronto's first black police chief.
[01:28:18.671 --> 01:28:20.453]  And a year later, he resigned.
[01:28:21.093 --> 01:28:42.168]  During his resignation speech, he bragged about tempting offers coming from the international private sector, and went on immediately to join the company Deloitte, whose CEO sits on the board of directors at Pfizer, and who was awarded over $40 million by the CDC to build a vaccine management system.
[01:28:43.609 --> 01:28:49.933]  A couple months before the COVID-19 scandemic, Peter Sloly was made chief of the Ottawa police.
[01:28:51.815 --> 01:29:01.179]  While the world celebrates the inspiring human spirit coming from the people of Canada, their own police steal their gasoline to freeze them out.
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.161]  Families and children.
[01:29:05.681 --> 01:29:09.843]  And the foundations of an incoming false flag are now being identified.
[01:29:10.583 --> 01:29:18.347]  Meet Peter Downing, a former cop for the RCMP who was given full pay and a clean record after a criminal conviction.
[01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:31.950]   Downing is the head of Wexit, An Alberta separatist movement seeking to overrule Canadian law with decrees set by the United Nations and funded by a woman who sits on the board of the Atlantic Council.
[01:29:32.530 --> 01:29:36.951]  The Atlantic Council founded CrowdStrike, which ties them to Hillary Clinton.
[01:29:37.491 --> 01:29:41.312]  They are funded by George Soros and the Ukraine's Burisma.
[01:29:42.052 --> 01:29:48.654]  They are considered a threat to constitutional order by the Russian government and they fund Peter Downing's Wexit.
[01:29:49.734 --> 01:29:57.456]  Wexit has made itself a part of the Ottawa protests and their connections to George Soros and the RCMP should be cause for alarm.
[01:29:58.176 --> 01:30:01.537]  People need to be on the lookout for state-sponsored shenanigans.
[01:30:01.838 --> 01:30:35.411]   We've been told that one of the triggers or indicators where we know that they are going to physically move against us and start arresting us is when our media goes down when all of our telecommunications devices do go down when we go fully black the next phase of this will be the public order units will move in on us and start kettling this is it if there's a media blackout of everybody that you're connected to with this freedom convoy
[01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:44.072]  That's your trigger that you know something is up, and I would encourage you to make arrangements and immediately start heading to Ottawa.
[01:30:44.992 --> 01:31:02.858]  Trudeau's liberals are now scurrying to pass their new anti-hate laws, straight out of communist China, where a Canadian can be fined $70,000 and thrown in jail for up to four years for the crime of posting anything on the internet that the government deems inappropriate.
[01:31:04.137 --> 01:31:06.778]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reis.
[01:31:06.778 --> 01:31:29.217]   If the government served the people, then the government would have nothing to fear
[01:31:29.217 --> 01:31:29.738]  from the people.
[01:31:30.413 --> 01:31:32.374]  But it is clear that now the government fears us.
[01:31:33.786 --> 01:31:41.710]  After years of persistent abuse of the Constitution, during which time they have betrayed, robbed, injured and killed the Australian people, we have had enough.
[01:31:42.270 --> 01:31:43.071]  And we are not alone.
[01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:50.194]  Internationally, the people are rising up peacefully against the unlawful and criminal excesses of those whom they have elected.
[01:31:50.634 --> 01:31:56.237]  Millions of good and decent men and women around the world have decided that this war for the world must end.
[01:31:56.717 --> 01:32:01.420]  And they know it will end when enough of us stand up and declare, in one voice, no more.
[01:32:02.532 --> 01:32:18.725]  Here in Australia, the people are gathering in the nation's capital, Canberra, in order to communicate their intent that the Governor-General should meet his constitutional responsibility by dissolving the Parliament and appointing a new Executive Council in order to prepare for free and fair elections.
[01:32:19.846 --> 01:32:24.069]  In the long journey from barbarism to civilisation, days such as these are rare.
[01:32:24.990 --> 01:32:32.016]  Seminal days, when a people bands together, putting aside their petty differences in order to secure their lives and their liberty.
[01:32:32.984 --> 01:32:36.146]  In other words, to earn their rights to their sovereign nationhood.
[01:32:37.027 --> 01:32:39.909]  Now is the time to play your part in the liberation of Australia.
[01:32:40.289 --> 01:32:44.212]  Now is the time to stand alongside your fellow Australians and resist the tyranny.
[01:32:44.672 --> 01:32:48.235]  Now is the time to ensure your children and grandchildren are free.
[01:32:48.995 --> 01:32:53.578]  You are here because generations ago your ancestors sacrificed all for you.
[01:32:53.899 --> 01:32:55.660]  It is now time to pay that debt forward.
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:58.402]  Now, nothing else matters.
[01:32:59.361 --> 01:33:00.482]  This is not about politics.
[01:33:00.622 --> 01:33:02.043]  This is a non-political event.
[01:33:02.423 --> 01:33:04.565]  This is about our very lives and our very future.
[01:33:05.045 --> 01:33:07.968]  You must drop everything and get to Canberra as soon as you can.
[01:33:08.628 --> 01:33:13.652]  Some have made their way from far afield as Adelaide, Melbourne and Rockhampton.
[01:33:14.632 --> 01:33:15.493]  What's your excuse?
[01:33:16.674 --> 01:33:19.036]  And they plan to stay until we win.
[01:33:20.357 --> 01:33:22.919]  Remain calm regardless of the force used against you.
[01:33:23.419 --> 01:33:28.503]  They will provoke a reaction which ultimately will see the use of police snipers opening fire.
[01:33:29.364 --> 01:33:30.285]  This is a reality.
[01:33:30.885 --> 01:33:37.029]  Regardless of the force used against you, you must, we must, remain calm in order to win.
[01:33:37.950 --> 01:33:43.233]  Fly, drive, walk if you must, but we need an army of millions in Canberra to win this war.
[01:33:43.754 --> 01:33:45.595]  And we will win if you attend.
[01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:48.375]  Pack up as much food and water as you can.
[01:33:48.675 --> 01:33:51.877]  The people already there are sharing and cooperating as never before.
[01:33:52.338 --> 01:33:54.439]  If you can't find accommodation, sleep in your car.
[01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:56.120]  We must come together now.
[01:33:56.660 --> 01:33:57.941]  This is our time.
[01:33:58.502 --> 01:33:59.122]  We the people.
[01:33:59.622 --> 01:34:02.224]  Do it for your family and do it for the future of Australia.
[01:34:02.984 --> 01:34:03.825]  I'm Ricardo Bozzi.
[01:34:03.945 --> 01:34:05.945]  I'm looking forward to seeing you there.
[01:34:05.945 --> 01:34:20.585]  It's hour number three.
[01:34:20.585 --> 01:34:23.784]  Wednesday, February 9th, 2020.
[01:34:23.846 --> 01:34:31.635]  And to say we're living in epic times is an extreme understatement.
[01:34:31.675 --> 01:34:38.343]  Look at the power of humanity from Australia to Canada, from Germany to Brazil.
[01:34:40.166 --> 01:34:43.511]  All over the world, in Africa, in the Middle East, and across Asia.
[01:34:44.332 --> 01:34:51.501]  In Russia, people are saying no to the vaccine mandates, no to the vaccine passports, and no to Klaus Schwab and the Great Reset.
[01:34:53.804 --> 01:34:54.965]  Epic, epic, epic.
[01:34:56.668 --> 01:35:09.772]  Suddenly, as soon as people begin to demonstrate and march and say no, oh, the Democratic Party says we don't want to wear masks, we don't want to make you take the shot, it's whatever they can get, whatever the bullies can grab, they will do.
[01:35:10.892 --> 01:35:14.273]  Why was Australia and Canada and New Zealand picked as the main targets?
[01:35:14.293 --> 01:35:25.973]   Well, because the Anglo-American British East India Company, Cecil Rhodes Combine, that's not blaming the British people, but was based out of there, had a world empire through a corporate system already set up.
[01:35:26.413 --> 01:35:27.933]  The British Empire was a corporate system.
[01:35:28.253 --> 01:35:32.214]  And now the New World Order is just that system taking over.
[01:35:33.354 --> 01:35:41.576]  And of course it sucks dry the British and the Scots and the Irish and the Americans and the Australians and the Canadians and the New Zealanders that pay for it.
[01:35:42.196 --> 01:35:46.197]  We're the muscle of it, the ingenuity and the brains, but they're the parasite on top.
[01:35:47.782 --> 01:35:53.005]  So Syrian girl's been coming on the show since the whole Syrian conflict started, seems like a decade ago now.
[01:35:53.085 --> 01:35:59.870]  Her family was part of the ruling party there, actually got kicked out by Assad, but she was still against that false war, which has been proven to be a fraud.
[01:36:00.190 --> 01:36:02.271]  Helped expose massive false flags and more with us.
[01:36:02.811 --> 01:36:04.693]  She's a geopolitical analyst and chemist.
[01:36:05.253 --> 01:36:10.954]  She's 100% Syrian to the core and comes from a former ruling class family that was deposed by the Baathist coup.
[01:36:11.374 --> 01:36:15.235]  She resides in Western Australia, where the crackdown on the unvaccinated is the worst.
[01:36:15.795 --> 01:36:19.536]  She is the eyewitness account of the COVID-19 measures having been implemented there.
[01:36:20.016 --> 01:36:26.098]  During her days at Pfizer, she was also a quality control chemist and her job was to check the drugs were safe.
[01:36:26.458 --> 01:36:30.458]   And early on she was pro-vaccine because it's a real technology can really work and be great.
[01:36:30.458 --> 01:36:35.098]   But now she's turned against what's happening. She's on Twitter @partisangirl,
[01:36:35.098 --> 01:36:39.838]  YouTube @syriangirlpartisan, Telegram @syriangirlpartisan.
[01:36:39.838 --> 01:36:43.317]   Syrian girl, I feel like your family. I've known you so long. You've come on so many
[01:36:43.317 --> 01:36:44.218]  times on all the shows.
[01:36:44.448 --> 01:36:45.069]  God bless you.
[01:36:45.389 --> 01:36:47.270]  I'm gonna try to shut up because you know I interrupt a lot.
[01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:50.532]  You've got the floor to talk about why is Australia the main target?
[01:36:50.912 --> 01:36:52.113]  What's happening with these shots?
[01:36:52.173 --> 01:36:55.656]  We couldn't have a better person to really give us the inside scoop.
[01:36:55.676 --> 01:36:56.476]  So thank you so much.
[01:36:56.716 --> 01:36:58.498]  And I know it's really the middle of the night there in Australia.
[01:36:58.518 --> 01:36:58.938]  So thank you.
[01:37:00.535 --> 01:37:01.677]  No, thank you Alex.
[01:37:01.798 --> 01:37:02.659]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:37:02.699 --> 01:37:04.523]  It's always an honor to be here.
[01:37:04.543 --> 01:37:05.865]  You do such great work.
[01:37:05.905 --> 01:37:09.973]  You know, you've been fighting this since before my war in Syria.
[01:37:10.013 --> 01:37:13.219]  You've always warned us about the globalists and pretty much everything you said.
[01:37:13.877 --> 01:37:15.818]  What's going to happen is now happening.
[01:37:15.838 --> 01:37:21.841]  I wasn't pro-vax, especially not a vax that's so experimental as this is.
[01:37:22.221 --> 01:37:32.165]  In fact, I made a video in 2020, in about April, kind of exposing this whole thing, Bill Gates, ID2020, but it immediately got censored off YouTube.
[01:37:32.225 --> 01:37:40.949]  And I saw the climate, what it was like, and I just sort of moved away and went to Telegram because I knew that the social media was going to censor it.
[01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:42.592]  Well I'm sorry for misrepresenting that.
[01:37:42.612 --> 01:37:45.198]  The point is you're not against vaccines in total though.
[01:37:46.357 --> 01:37:47.618]  Yeah, you're absolutely correct.
[01:37:47.738 --> 01:37:48.938]  Yes, that is absolutely correct.
[01:37:49.159 --> 01:37:54.742]  And in fact, at the beginning, I did think that the virus might be dangerous because I believed it was a biological weapon.
[01:37:55.422 --> 01:37:59.084]  Obviously, it's mutated a lot since then, and now it's basically just a cold.
[01:37:59.584 --> 01:38:10.770]  But I do think, like, my job for Pfizer was to make sure that these drugs are safe, and we had all of these rules to follow to make sure that's the case and all of that's been thrown out the window.
[01:38:10.791 --> 01:38:15.013]  It's just such a weird coincidence that I also used to work for Pfizer.
[01:38:16.014 --> 01:38:23.670]  And, you know, I come onto your show to talk about Syria, but there is something that's really bugging me, and that's when they keep telling us to trust the science.
[01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:28.341]  Because obviously the whole point of science is that you shouldn't trust it.
[01:38:28.401 --> 01:38:33.443]  You should do experiments, you should get data, and then you should not even trust that.
[01:38:33.483 --> 01:38:35.204]  You should continually test things.
[01:38:35.564 --> 01:38:42.847]  But for some reason, science is now being treated as a religion, and people are being forced to be part of an experiment.
[01:38:43.587 --> 01:38:44.887]  It's completely unethical.
[01:38:44.927 --> 01:38:47.368]  It's against everything we're supposedly told.
[01:38:47.868 --> 01:38:54.172]   But you know, this is not the first time that Pfizer was You know, up to no good.
[01:38:54.253 --> 01:39:05.626]  I mean, in fact, Nigeria is suing them for $7 billion for experimenting on children with an anti-meningitis drug, which ended up killing 11 kids.
[01:39:06.627 --> 01:39:09.590]  And, you know, they had vaccines as well.
[01:39:09.630 --> 01:39:16.952]   Like, You know, I said I support some vaccines, but it's not like you can just assume that they're always safe.
[01:39:17.252 --> 01:39:19.693]  Vaccines have been pulled from the market before.
[01:39:20.092 --> 01:39:24.532]   We had the dengue fever vaccine, which they gave to 300,000 children
[01:39:24.532 --> 01:39:30.112]   before they realized that it actually caused them to get sicker
[01:39:30.112 --> 01:39:31.632]  once they got the virus.
[01:39:31.632 --> 01:39:38.291]   And we have AstraZeneca here in Australia, AstraZeneca being one of the COVID-19 vaccines.
[01:39:38.291 --> 01:39:40.733]  In Australia, they pulled it from the market.
[01:39:40.733 --> 01:39:44.252]   And only like 12 months ago, they were telling everyone it was safe.
[01:39:44.252 --> 01:39:46.653]  And I find this completely --
[01:39:46.672 --> 01:39:51.893]   you know, it's like they're gaslighting us because we're not allowed to question things.
[01:39:52.010 --> 01:39:56.694]  And yet the very vaccines that 12 months ago they told us were safe are being pulled from the market.
[01:39:57.335 --> 01:40:05.822]  It's against everything you learn as a chemist and what we were told, supposedly, when we were checking for quality of these drugs.
[01:40:06.442 --> 01:40:12.988]  And I would definitely want to go on to talk to you about the biological weapons aspect of this, if I can.
[01:40:13.628 --> 01:40:39.669]   And how what we've been experiencing here living in Australia and you know how this is a worldwide thing because this is the World Economic Forum that's kind of pushing this thing from the top down and they've somehow infiltrated all of these governments around the world Certainly, they've infiltrated Australia heavily, and now it's not just about the vaccines.
[01:40:39.949 --> 01:40:44.693]  They're bringing in a digital identity in order to create a carbon quota.
[01:40:44.713 --> 01:40:45.233]  Well, that's right.
[01:40:45.253 --> 01:40:47.955]  That's the wedge they use as the virus to get in.
[01:40:48.075 --> 01:40:49.516]  Once they have the global ID, they've got it all.
[01:40:49.857 --> 01:40:50.817]  Syrian Girl's our guest.
[01:40:50.837 --> 01:40:51.278]  Stay with us.
[01:40:52.439 --> 01:40:57.763]  Well, Syrian Girl is our special guest, been coming on with us for close to a decade.
[01:40:58.723 --> 01:41:05.230]  And she is a geopolitical analyst, chemist, and she has really been an expert on so much of what's happening in the world.
[01:41:05.691 --> 01:41:13.659]  So get into the big picture as an Australian, what you're seeing unfold, the Great Reset, what's happening in the country currently, and where you think this is all going.
[01:41:13.679 --> 01:41:19.686]  And then as a chemist, her work for Pfizer, the origins of this and where you see it going.
[01:41:22.612 --> 01:41:23.173]  Absolutely.
[01:41:23.233 --> 01:41:24.114]  Thank you so much.
[01:41:24.215 --> 01:41:30.884]  Well, if it's okay with you, I'm going to flip that around a bit and talk about my Pfizer stuff first.
[01:41:30.965 --> 01:41:34.470]  I think that's the contribution I can bring to the show.
[01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:34.910]  Yes, please.
[01:41:36.707 --> 01:41:37.448]  Thank you so much.
[01:41:37.668 --> 01:41:47.016]  Well, you know, Pfizer, as I said previously, the company has some of the worst history when it comes to side effects.
[01:41:47.817 --> 01:41:48.337]  And you're right.
[01:41:48.457 --> 01:41:49.958]  I was never an anti-vaxxer.
[01:41:49.978 --> 01:41:52.240]  Obviously, I worked in the pharmaceutical industry.
[01:41:53.061 --> 01:42:01.308]  But in this case, I'm just shocked that they're coming out with vaccines, you know, without even testing whether they're safe or effective.
[01:42:01.649 --> 01:42:07.032]   And clearly, they haven't been able to Stop the spread using these vaccines.
[01:42:07.052 --> 01:42:10.675]  You know, you can still acquire the virus, even if you take it.
[01:42:11.055 --> 01:42:13.116]  And yet they're still introducing these mandates.
[01:42:13.416 --> 01:42:14.817]  They make absolutely no sense.
[01:42:15.297 --> 01:42:21.321]  And yes, as shown on your screen, you know, they're getting so much money out of this from taxpayers.
[01:42:21.861 --> 01:42:32.107]  Even though the taxes were used to create the vaccine in the first place, and any side effects that are happening, they have indemnity, so they can't be sued.
[01:42:32.627 --> 01:42:34.689]  It's complete garbage.
[01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:41.012]  But, you know, I want to discuss a bit more about the biological weapon possibility or aspect of this.
[01:42:41.373 --> 01:42:49.354]   You know, there's a lot of suspicious stuff that was happening before, you know, you had Bill Gates, came up with this ID2020 just before,
[01:42:49.354 --> 01:42:54.715]   like in December 2019, just before the outbreak, where he was proposing this business model
[01:42:54.715 --> 01:43:00.494]   where you can link like quantum dots inside a vaccine as a form of digital identification.
[01:43:00.494 --> 01:43:03.194]  So the building blocks of this were already there.
[01:43:03.194 --> 01:43:06.315]   But the most important thing, I mean, I'm sure your viewers have heard
[01:43:06.315 --> 01:43:10.315]   of gain of function and whatnot, but the most important thing is,
[01:43:10.315 --> 01:43:15.435]   I can tell you guys, is that there's a 19 length sequence of the RNA
[01:43:15.435 --> 01:43:23.935]   in the COVID-19 virus that exactly matches that of a Moderna patent from 2018,
[01:43:23.935 --> 01:43:26.575]  which was for HIV vaccine.
[01:43:27.032 --> 01:43:34.014]  And this is a bit more technical, but that sequence occurs in the most suspicious part of the SARS virus, the coronavirus-19.
[01:43:34.634 --> 01:43:38.955]  It's the foreign cleavage site that has the sequence from HIV.
[01:43:39.966 --> 01:43:42.469]  That sequence has never occurred before in history.
[01:43:42.569 --> 01:43:47.355]  And so the chance of it occurring randomly in nature is like over a billion to one.
[01:43:47.995 --> 01:43:53.021]  And a few days ago, Moderna just released a new HIV mRNA vaccine.
[01:43:53.081 --> 01:43:55.084]  So I wonder if that's just a coincidence.
[01:43:55.652 --> 01:43:59.813]  And I want to say that why are they so insistent on using mRNA?
[01:44:00.213 --> 01:44:11.017]  And that's because they want to insert RNA into people to create not just proteins, but what Microsoft are calling biological circuits.
[01:44:11.677 --> 01:44:15.960]  And what the World Economic Forum are calling hacking humans.
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:20.022]  I mean, these are the words from their own mouths.
[01:44:20.642 --> 01:44:27.186]  And I think that, you know, these guys are insane because they themselves call themselves the global elite.
[01:44:27.426 --> 01:44:31.549]  I mean, I don't know exactly what you warned us about all of these years.
[01:44:32.409 --> 01:44:45.782]  And I think that it was meant to be a much more dangerous virus, but because coronaviruses mutate so rapidly, it wasn't as initially planned, but they're still going ahead and pushing with the agenda for digital identification.
[01:44:46.783 --> 01:44:50.406]  And, you know, here in Australia, I'm in the belly of the beast.
[01:44:50.506 --> 01:44:55.271]  You can see that's the Prime Minister of Australia getting his instructions from the World Economic Forum.
[01:44:55.991 --> 01:45:00.797]  And, you know, they were just like patting him on the back because he was introducing digital ID.
[01:45:01.878 --> 01:45:04.241]  And it shows you what their plan is.
[01:45:04.261 --> 01:45:12.798]   Their plan is that you can't Go anywhere without informing the government where you're going, what you're buying.
[01:45:13.138 --> 01:45:14.098]  That's what we have here.
[01:45:14.339 --> 01:45:16.600]  So right now, I can't go inside a hospital.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:21.763]  I'm barred from going to hospitals, where people are being laid off work.
[01:45:22.283 --> 01:45:25.605]  Women are being turned away from hospitals and their babies.
[01:45:26.726 --> 01:45:28.587]  For some reason, also, I'm not allowed in the zoo.
[01:45:29.226 --> 01:45:36.747]   I don't know why they chose to shut down the zoo for the unvaccinated, but it's just like punishing people who have made a choice
[01:45:36.747 --> 01:45:37.626]  not to be part of the experiment.
[01:45:37.626 --> 01:45:42.666]   Well, that's right. Again, Syrian girl, Maram Sussali is her real name. She's a chemist,
[01:45:42.666 --> 01:45:47.306]   well-known journalist. This is so huge, but I want you to go back and we'll come back next
[01:45:47.306 --> 01:45:51.867]   segment with more time and get into, first thing, you can't see old people in nursing
[01:45:51.867 --> 01:45:55.065]  homes. They could kill them in Australia and the US.
[01:45:55.257 --> 01:45:56.277]  It was all UN runs.
[01:45:56.297 --> 01:45:56.998]  It was all over the world.
[01:45:57.438 --> 01:46:01.781]  And then now seeing children that are sick, parents can't see them, truly terrorizing people.
[01:46:01.821 --> 01:46:02.822]  We'll talk about that next segment.
[01:46:02.842 --> 01:46:09.806]  But going back, I remember the Indian University scanned the virus and said it's got the HIV spike protein man-made delivery system.
[01:46:09.826 --> 01:46:14.550]  And it turns out Fauci and Moderna and Bill Gates and others, as you said, have connections to it.
[01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:17.692]  And it's clearly man-made and now top scientists have confirmed that.
[01:46:18.945 --> 01:46:24.710]  Now we're seeing all these extra HIV cases, HIV false positives for people that have had the vaccine.
[01:46:25.491 --> 01:46:31.116]  Even Forbes saying scientists warn that you've got an increased chance of getting HIV if you've had the vaccine.
[01:46:31.796 --> 01:46:34.318]  We know Fauci was involved in the rollout of HIV.
[01:46:34.358 --> 01:46:35.019]  We know this.
[01:46:35.479 --> 01:46:37.481]  So this looks very diabolical.
[01:46:37.861 --> 01:46:40.444]  And we know there's a lot of health problems with those that have taken the shots.
[01:46:40.864 --> 01:46:46.509]  But what we're hearing from a lot of scientists is actually turning off the killer T's in the white blood cells.
[01:46:48.900 --> 01:46:54.903]  So, the T-cells actually, it's like the tumor necrosis factor, they fight cancer.
[01:46:55.343 --> 01:47:13.273]  So, you know, it is part of your immune system and of course it would, you know, AIDS is supposed to be the disease that HIV causes and that is where your immune system no longer works to fight, you know, to mount a defense.
[01:47:13.922 --> 01:47:17.665]  The thing is that we don't even know what's going to happen with these.
[01:47:17.785 --> 01:47:19.366]  That's the most terrifying thing.
[01:47:19.386 --> 01:47:21.407]  We don't even know what will happen.
[01:47:23.009 --> 01:47:24.790]  The time is going to show itself.
[01:47:25.110 --> 01:47:51.538]   But the fact that Fauci was one of the leading scientists when it comes to AIDS, the links between this HIV 19, this sub-19 sequence This 19-length sequence of RNA in that virus, in coronavirus, matches a patent that Moderna had since 2018 for a HIV vaccine.
[01:47:52.319 --> 01:47:55.000]  That just can't be a coincidence.
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.700]  It's impossible.
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:58.301]  Like, it's scientifically impossible.
[01:47:58.601 --> 01:48:03.863]  And it's not a coincidence that he ran the program of gain-of-function, that he lied about it, and that he's a depopulationist.
[01:48:03.883 --> 01:48:05.344]  I mean, he's caught red-handed.
[01:48:05.544 --> 01:48:06.304]  This is insane!
[01:48:08.422 --> 01:48:11.244]  Yes, and he was funding the Wuhan lab.
[01:48:11.504 --> 01:48:13.525]  I mean, it's just bizarre.
[01:48:14.365 --> 01:48:20.028]  I was also suspicious about the fact that this all happened in China.
[01:48:20.128 --> 01:48:22.249]  The virus was released during Chinese New Year.
[01:48:22.269 --> 01:48:24.610]  That's me when I was in Pfizer.
[01:48:25.631 --> 01:48:28.813]  Yes, so it was just when people were about to travel.
[01:48:29.513 --> 01:48:35.036]  So it was kind of like the perfect timing for a disease to really spread.
[01:48:35.732 --> 01:48:38.673]  Um, which was the intention, I believe, of releasing it at that time.
[01:48:40.334 --> 01:48:41.094]  All right, stay there.
[01:48:41.414 --> 01:48:43.335]  That is just so huge, and it's admitted.
[01:48:43.375 --> 01:48:43.995]  It's even in the news.
[01:48:44.435 --> 01:48:46.616]  Oh, he's got the HIV spike patented.
[01:48:46.636 --> 01:48:53.619]  It popped up in this in a lab he ran, but it's all natural, and they approached the Pentagon about wanting to release it in China in 2017.
[01:48:53.659 --> 01:48:56.160]  I think you probably set them up, but they said no.
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:58.561]  I mean, you can't make that up.
[01:48:58.681 --> 01:49:00.662]   Syrian girl, She's here with us.
[01:49:00.882 --> 01:49:01.482]  She's a chemist.
[01:49:01.502 --> 01:49:02.363]  She worked for Pfizer.
[01:49:02.723 --> 01:49:09.207]  She's been a long-term guest of us, and we'll talk about the Great Reset and where she sees us going and how we beat it and more straight ahead.
[01:49:09.227 --> 01:49:10.247]  Tell everybody you know, tune in.
[01:49:10.568 --> 01:49:12.369]  And once this video is archived, share it.
[01:49:12.689 --> 01:49:13.670]  This is a big deal.
[01:49:13.730 --> 01:49:14.590]  She's the real deal.
[01:49:14.610 --> 01:49:14.990]  Stay with us.
[01:49:15.891 --> 01:49:22.235]  We warn from the scientists and researchers we talk to that this so-called vaccine could give people HIV and then AIDS.
[01:49:23.356 --> 01:49:34.310]   And here's Forbes in October, seven, eight months later, Saying the same thing, but now HIV cases are exploding worldwide.
[01:49:35.371 --> 01:49:39.675]  Syrian girl, who I should call Chemistry Girl, is here with us.
[01:49:39.815 --> 01:49:41.196]  Worked for Pfizer, you name it.
[01:49:42.337 --> 01:49:45.320]  Well known to this show for her other journalistic activities.
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:49.564]  Please continue with all your research and what you want to impart to folks.
[01:49:51.496 --> 01:49:53.678]  Well, thanks so much again.
[01:49:53.698 --> 01:49:56.059]  It's always been an honour to come on your show.
[01:49:56.079 --> 01:49:57.961]  You've always been fighting a good fight.
[01:49:58.021 --> 01:50:05.386]  It's just astounding that, again I have to say, what you warned us about, the global elite, it's happening.
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:11.482]  It's just an honor to be in the same fight, you know, it's us against them at the end of the day.
[01:50:11.502 --> 01:50:14.163]  Well, I mean, back at you, but to my, I mean, I don't get the credit.
[01:50:14.203 --> 01:50:17.065]  I was reading their own documents and I knew they were going to plan this.
[01:50:17.085 --> 01:50:18.625]  But yeah, we said they'd use a virus.
[01:50:19.045 --> 01:50:19.926]  They'd have lockdowns.
[01:50:19.966 --> 01:50:21.546]  I mean, they had all this planned.
[01:50:21.586 --> 01:50:24.328]  So that was my question to you and I forgot to ask it.
[01:50:25.368 --> 01:50:29.955]  I think a consensus is forming about globalism, depopulation, the biomedical tyranny.
[01:50:29.976 --> 01:50:30.977]  In fact, we know it's forming.
[01:50:31.718 --> 01:50:36.165]  What's your view on that, and how do you think the dark side, the globalists, strikes back right now?
[01:50:36.185 --> 01:50:39.751]  Because they were winning the last few years, but things are turning against them, in my view.
[01:50:42.202 --> 01:50:42.803]  Absolutely.
[01:50:42.863 --> 01:50:48.311]  I think they're being very ham-fisted with this digital ID stuff, especially in Australia.
[01:50:48.371 --> 01:50:51.074]  It's not like they're saying it's about the virus.
[01:50:51.134 --> 01:50:54.699]  They're saying, oh, here's digital ID.
[01:50:54.719 --> 01:50:56.762]  You know, like, this will save us.
[01:50:56.922 --> 01:50:58.284]  But for some reason, this...
[01:50:59.325 --> 01:51:02.947]  They've introduced this app called the GovID.
[01:51:03.547 --> 01:51:04.588]  So GovID.
[01:51:04.948 --> 01:51:07.169]  Covid became Govid all of a sudden.
[01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:09.610]  It was Govid all along probably.
[01:51:10.111 --> 01:51:16.014]  So this app is actually connected to the Welfare Office and the Tax Office.
[01:51:16.454 --> 01:51:30.305]   So what they want is when, and this is the head of our state, the Premier, Um, Mark McGowan, very much hated at the moment, you know, he's just out there telling us next time we're just gonna nobody votes on this.
[01:51:30.685 --> 01:51:31.826]  Nobody was consulted.
[01:51:31.846 --> 01:51:33.888]  We're just gonna do this digital ID.
[01:51:34.088 --> 01:51:35.930]  And if you don't do it, you can't work.
[01:51:36.230 --> 01:51:36.891]  You can't eat.
[01:51:37.171 --> 01:51:38.412]  You can't sit in a cafe.
[01:51:38.432 --> 01:51:40.394]  I mean, I've been turned away from cafes.
[01:51:41.074 --> 01:51:42.715]  Turned away from movie theaters.
[01:51:42.996 --> 01:51:44.076]  I can't leave the state.
[01:51:44.176 --> 01:51:45.337]  I can't leave the country.
[01:51:45.457 --> 01:51:48.039]  I'm basically a prisoner in my own country.
[01:51:49.020 --> 01:51:50.501]  And you become a second-class citizen.
[01:51:50.881 --> 01:51:52.382]  That is what we are living here.
[01:51:52.402 --> 01:51:57.045]  And a lot of people, they don't want to take the vaccine, but they've been forced to.
[01:51:57.505 --> 01:52:00.848]  And then they'll say, well, most people took the vaccine, so they must be going along with it.
[01:52:01.168 --> 01:52:04.050]  Well, they don't think they have any other choice because they can't feed their families.
[01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:09.614]  I know people who have children who can't get a job because they're unvaccinated.
[01:52:10.875 --> 01:52:12.536]  You know, and these people are scientists.
[01:52:13.177 --> 01:52:25.969]  So, like, I just wanted to say about the global agenda, you know, the Prime Minister here, the head of the country, he is getting the pat on the back from the World Economic Forum.
[01:52:26.689 --> 01:52:29.252]  They have many, many plans for this.
[01:52:29.312 --> 01:52:31.514]  They want to introduce a carbon quota.
[01:52:31.574 --> 01:52:35.758]  So basically, they want to introduce scarcity into petrol.
[01:52:36.378 --> 01:52:38.160]  This is a science thing as well.
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:49.748]  They kept telling us that oil is caused by fossil fuels, but as a matter of fact, it's actually caused by the crust and the magma and the pressure between them.
[01:52:50.088 --> 01:52:53.251]   So if you were to dig super deep You will hit oil.
[01:52:53.531 --> 01:52:55.233]  That's why super deep wells are happening.
[01:52:55.513 --> 01:53:02.399]  That's why Russia and America are now one of the biggest oil producers in the world, instead of being Saudi Arabia.
[01:53:02.779 --> 01:53:07.483]  So, you know, so now they need to reintroduce scarcity so they can make money off it.
[01:53:07.824 --> 01:53:10.126]  And that's where the carbon credit thing is coming.
[01:53:10.486 --> 01:53:16.330]   And I do believe that with this GovID, these QR codes, They're going to introduce a carbon quota.
[01:53:16.590 --> 01:53:23.732]  So you will not be able to go, for example, to the next town over if you've, you know, had your carbon quota filled for the week.
[01:53:24.093 --> 01:53:24.713]  That's right.
[01:53:24.753 --> 01:53:26.353]  Even if you have the money, you can't do it.
[01:53:26.453 --> 01:53:37.878]  In fact, the UN, Debo's group of people that are tuning in admit, we're going to get the digital ID for medical shots, then it'll be the carbon ID, the social credit score that tracks everything you do in live time.
[01:53:38.178 --> 01:53:41.799]  That's why they're putting kill switches in all the cars, everything, total control.
[01:53:43.553 --> 01:53:48.657]  Yes, you won't even be able to start your car without this QR code saying if you have carbon quota.
[01:53:48.937 --> 01:53:55.121]  And I bet you that the billionaires, it won't affect them because they'll be able to pay to offset their carbon.
[01:53:55.161 --> 01:54:05.749]   That's what they'll say, because that's what they're saying now when it comes to jets and all of the things that were Like, you know, not compulsory, they were voluntary will be made compulsory soon.
[01:54:06.189 --> 01:54:07.410]  And that's the official plan.
[01:54:07.450 --> 01:54:08.291]  It's not even debated now.
[01:54:08.311 --> 01:54:12.654]  I mean, Obama has a huge $20 million deal right on the water in Martha's Vineyard.
[01:54:12.674 --> 01:54:14.776]  He's got another huge mansion in Hawaii.
[01:54:15.016 --> 01:54:17.878]  But they say 10 years ago, all of us will be flooded.
[01:54:17.938 --> 01:54:19.800]  It's all a giant power grab, all a lie.
[01:54:21.762 --> 01:54:22.382]  Absolutely.
[01:54:22.402 --> 01:54:23.463]  I mean, it's...
[01:54:25.217 --> 01:54:30.138]  I don't think it exists.
[01:54:30.158 --> 01:54:31.979]  You're a chemist, and I've talked to a lot of chemists.
[01:54:32.339 --> 01:54:39.820]  They used to think that the oil was fossil fuel, but now they're saying that it just keeps refilling.
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:45.721]  Even old wells that my family's had in West Texas for 70, 80 years that were dead wells have now been reopened.
[01:54:46.022 --> 01:54:47.522]  They just filled back up with oil.
[01:54:47.562 --> 01:54:48.182]  What's going on there?
[01:54:49.525 --> 01:54:52.066]  Yes, it's the abiotic theory of oil.
[01:54:52.166 --> 01:54:54.947]  Actually, it's been known for a hundred years.
[01:54:55.007 --> 01:55:00.389]  It's just that they've continued this lie of fossil fuels because they want to introduce scarcity.
[01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:06.031]  Just like De Beers, you know, they keep all the diamonds away from the market to introduce scarcity.
[01:55:06.071 --> 01:55:06.451]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:55:06.491 --> 01:55:08.272]  Diamonds aren't even semi-precious, folks.
[01:55:08.292 --> 01:55:09.713]  There's mountains other than Africa.
[01:55:09.733 --> 01:55:13.534]  De Beers will just kill you with secret police if you try to get them out.
[01:55:13.554 --> 01:55:16.915]  And then they call anybody that sells a diamond that they don't sell a blood diamond.
[01:55:16.955 --> 01:55:18.856]  Really, all their diamonds are the blood diamonds.
[01:55:20.866 --> 01:55:22.530]  I wanted to say about how to fight this.
[01:55:22.550 --> 01:55:24.914]  I'm part of the movement here to resist this.
[01:55:25.515 --> 01:55:27.960]  I've spoken outside of Parliament in my state.
[01:55:28.641 --> 01:55:30.204]  Yeah, tell us what's happening in Australia.
[01:55:31.989 --> 01:55:35.152]  Yes, well, we have protests regularly at the moment.
[01:55:35.172 --> 01:55:42.337]  There's the Australian Peacemakers, headed by Nick Patterson, which is organising some of the biggest protests.
[01:55:42.778 --> 01:55:47.321]  And I have the honour to speak at some of them.
[01:55:47.842 --> 01:55:55.927]   And there's a group of police officers that are suing the government Because they don't agree with the mandates and they don't want to put people in prison for nothing.
[01:55:56.548 --> 01:55:58.889]  And they're fundraising right now for the legal fight.
[01:55:59.330 --> 01:56:03.172]  Unfortunately they're using GoFundMe and we're working on changing that.
[01:56:04.793 --> 01:56:08.296]  There is now a convoy in Canberra.
[01:56:08.536 --> 01:56:14.100]  The capital is Canberra, not Sydney, and they are occupying that.
[01:56:14.620 --> 01:56:30.035]  You know, it's not as big as what's happening in Canada, but we are a small country, and unfortunately people here are just very laissez-faire, very blasé about things, and a lot of them, even though they're not happy about it, have just gone on with it.
[01:56:30.135 --> 01:56:35.400]  So we're going to just have to hold the line and mount the resistance for this.
[01:56:37.542 --> 01:56:38.062]  Absolutely.
[01:56:38.103 --> 01:56:39.344]  What do you think comes next?
[01:56:44.162 --> 01:56:44.633]  I hope!
[01:56:45.544 --> 01:57:03.487]  That, you know, enough of this movement keeps growing and people's frustrations keep growing, especially because they're now pushing for the booster shot, that maybe people who have taken those two shots are now finally going to say enough is enough.
[01:57:04.327 --> 01:57:05.788]  That is the optimistic view.
[01:57:06.148 --> 01:57:13.969]  The pessimistic view is they're going to drag us kicking and screaming into what they're calling the fourth industrial revolution or the Great Reset.
[01:57:14.509 --> 01:57:24.714]  And they want to, in their minds, they're dreaming of creating synthetic biological machines and, you know, and hacking humans and changing our DNA.
[01:57:25.794 --> 01:57:27.795]  And that is what's happening there.
[01:57:28.175 --> 01:57:32.857]  There's wars as well everywhere, of course, to mention the war in Syria.
[01:57:33.177 --> 01:57:36.079]  You know, they're still, the sanctions are still going.
[01:57:36.099 --> 01:57:40.341]  Our oil is still, you know, we don't have access to our own energy resources.
[01:57:40.781 --> 01:57:50.710]   This is about, you know, They're making the world into a prison and this is the resistance.
[01:57:51.370 --> 01:57:53.653]  The thing is, we have to look at Australia.
[01:57:54.193 --> 01:58:01.761]  We're hoping that Americans will be able to resist this better than we can because you guys have a constitution that actually is much, much better than ours.
[01:58:02.962 --> 01:58:04.183]  And you guys still have weapons.
[01:58:04.524 --> 01:58:05.485]  So don't get rid of those.
[01:58:06.265 --> 01:58:06.866]  Well, that's right.
[01:58:06.906 --> 01:58:08.888]  People always want to say America's got problems, is it free?
[01:58:08.908 --> 01:58:09.288]  And I agree.
[01:58:09.308 --> 01:58:10.830]  It's like the best house in a bad neighborhood.
[01:58:11.170 --> 01:58:13.152]  But you notice we're better off than most other places.
[01:58:13.192 --> 01:58:16.255]  We have to be leaders and say no, not just here, but worldwide.
[01:58:16.315 --> 01:58:20.258]  And some Australian media says, don't get involved in our politics, sir.
[01:58:20.639 --> 01:58:21.860]  Well, wait, this is globalism.
[01:58:21.900 --> 01:58:22.801]  This is Klaus Schwab.
[01:58:23.201 --> 01:58:25.383]  The UN, Big Pharma is doing this to you.
[01:58:25.723 --> 01:58:28.206]  If they can take over Australia, they can take over America.
[01:58:28.566 --> 01:58:31.429]  We all have brotherhood, sisterhood, solidarity.
[01:58:32.819 --> 01:58:33.480]  With each other.
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:35.942]  And so this is all our fights.
[01:58:36.042 --> 01:58:37.523]  America is Australia's fight.
[01:58:38.004 --> 01:58:39.325]  Australia is America's fight.
[01:58:39.365 --> 01:58:39.925]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:40.406 --> 01:58:44.730]  Welcome back to the final segment with Syrian girl, chemist girl from Australia.
[01:58:45.430 --> 01:58:47.772]  Then I'm going to host a little bit of the next hour with some big breaking news.
[01:58:48.353 --> 01:58:54.759]  I've probably gotten no exaggeration 30, 40 phone calls in the last three days asking me if this is real.
[01:58:55.700 --> 01:58:56.460]  And of course it's real.
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:59:00.002]  It was officially funded in the spending package.
[01:59:00.482 --> 01:59:01.262]  Biden put it out.
[01:59:01.282 --> 01:59:06.544]  We've got links to the DHS and to the Department of Health and Human Services.
[01:59:08.205 --> 01:59:12.426]  They're now handing $30 million worth of crack pipes out to black people.
[01:59:13.266 --> 01:59:17.568]  Now imagine if I said I'm going to fund $30 million to give watermelons to black people.
[01:59:19.182 --> 01:59:21.324]  The left always says that's a racist thing.
[01:59:21.864 --> 01:59:25.165]  Or what if we were going to give $30 million of fried chicken to black people?
[01:59:25.446 --> 01:59:27.287]  You'd say, man, that's really racist.
[01:59:27.307 --> 01:59:29.848]  By the way, that's northerners, nothing against them.
[01:59:30.208 --> 01:59:35.511]  They would see southerners and blacks that moved up north in the last hundred years frying chicken.
[01:59:36.326 --> 01:59:37.366]  And eating watermelon?
[01:59:37.686 --> 01:59:40.547]  And they made a joke that that's what black people ate.
[01:59:40.807 --> 01:59:44.768]  So the North always makes jokes like Southerners are making fun of watermelon or fried chicken.
[01:59:45.008 --> 01:59:46.829]  No, we're going to take your watermelon and fried chicken.
[01:59:47.149 --> 01:59:52.891]  No one's making fun of black people for wanting watermelon and fried chicken or chicken fried steak or chitlins.
[01:59:53.051 --> 01:59:54.731]  Everybody eats that in the South, OK?
[01:59:55.191 --> 01:59:56.112]  My grandma cooked that.
[01:59:56.212 --> 01:59:56.672]  I cooked that.
[01:59:56.772 --> 01:59:57.352]  I love all that.
[01:59:57.672 --> 01:59:59.032]  I love all of it.
[02:00:00.453 --> 02:00:10.585]   But the point is, is that imagine if he said, hey, I've got cornbread for the black people or whatever, because the North thinks that's a black thing too.
[02:00:10.745 --> 02:00:12.586]  Well, yeah, they call it soul food up North.
[02:00:12.866 --> 02:00:15.407]  We just call it Southern food here in the South.
[02:00:16.648 --> 02:00:22.991]  But imagine, imagine if Joe Biden said, I'm going to supply $30 million worth of watermelon to black people.
[02:00:23.484 --> 02:00:24.484]  It would be a big deal.
[02:00:24.484 --> 02:00:29.084]  But crack pipes, oh, cracks for black people.
[02:00:29.084 --> 02:00:34.044]   He helped give blacks double and triple sentences, so did his vice president, if they got caught
[02:00:34.044 --> 02:00:37.003]  with crack instead of regular cocaine.
[02:00:37.003 --> 02:00:40.043]  Some folks for their first offense got 30 years.
[02:00:40.043 --> 02:00:41.843]  So I said I'd cover this next hour.
[02:00:41.843 --> 02:00:43.923]  I'm kind of covering it now.
[02:00:43.923 --> 02:00:46.203]  You read this.
[02:00:46.203 --> 02:00:49.843]   You look at this and they say black people are discriminated against.
[02:00:50.318 --> 02:00:52.339]  It actually says this, Soros pushed this.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:55.902]  It doesn't, they don't have nice crack pipes like Hunter Biden.
[02:00:56.262 --> 02:00:56.822]  I'm serious.
[02:00:57.263 --> 02:00:59.384]  If you're a new listener, this is not the Babylon Bee.
[02:00:59.824 --> 02:01:00.785]  This is not the onion.
[02:01:00.845 --> 02:01:01.566]  I'm not joking.
[02:01:01.626 --> 02:01:02.346]  This is real.
[02:01:02.666 --> 02:01:03.687]  Everybody's asking if it's real.
[02:01:03.847 --> 02:01:04.428]  Yes, it's real.
[02:01:04.988 --> 02:01:07.530]  Syrian girl, why do you think they're doing stuff like this?
[02:01:09.238 --> 02:01:14.419]  Maybe the CIA needs more funds now that they don't have the opium from Afghanistan.
[02:01:14.519 --> 02:01:15.900]  Exactly.
[02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:28.503]  Yeah, I heard that the heroin trade is drying up because now there's all this synthetic stuff that's just basically taken over from the kind of heroin you get from opium.
[02:01:28.923 --> 02:01:33.284]  So maybe the CIA needs a crowdfunding campaign.
[02:01:33.584 --> 02:01:41.174]  But imagine if I was a white guy and walked around, say, somewhere in Austin, I went to a black church and said, oh, black people, I brought crack pipes for you.
[02:01:42.136 --> 02:01:44.459]  It says crack pipes for black people.
[02:01:44.799 --> 02:01:45.580]  What the hell?
[02:01:47.057 --> 02:01:48.338]  I'd be extremely insulted.
[02:01:48.398 --> 02:01:51.139]  And I know Biden has a long history of racism.
[02:01:51.519 --> 02:01:54.541]  It was even against, you know, segregation.
[02:01:54.581 --> 02:01:56.742]  He was for segregation on buses.
[02:01:57.702 --> 02:02:00.964]  And, you know, he's, he's always slipping up.
[02:02:01.044 --> 02:02:12.010]   I believe he said that he's only able to, he thanked black women for stalking his Supermarket shelves, I believe, so yeah.
[02:02:12.030 --> 02:02:15.552]  He also says stuff like, I really like smart people and black people.
[02:02:15.572 --> 02:02:16.873]  That's a Joe Biden quote.
[02:02:18.098 --> 02:02:21.721]  For some reason he can get away with it, just because he's a liberal or a democrat.
[02:02:21.861 --> 02:02:29.566]  Well imagine if I said, for every black person listening, just send a self-addressed envelope and I'll send you a free crack pipe, because I know you like to smoke crack.
[02:02:30.146 --> 02:02:39.193]  When the CIA, as you know, came up with the ingredients for it, how to do it, ten times more addictive, and dumped it on black neighborhoods in the 1980s, which is declassified now.
[02:02:39.213 --> 02:02:42.235]  I mean, you can't make that up!
[02:02:44.418 --> 02:02:45.338]  They're still doing it.
[02:02:45.438 --> 02:02:46.118]  I mean, I don't know.
[02:02:46.699 --> 02:02:48.779]  It's not even a conspiracy theory.
[02:02:48.839 --> 02:02:49.799]  It's just a fact.
[02:02:49.839 --> 02:02:50.880]  Here's an example.
[02:02:50.900 --> 02:02:53.040]  We've got a couple of great black folks working at this office.
[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:54.721]  We don't think of them because they've got dark skin.
[02:02:54.781 --> 02:02:55.801]  We think of them as great patriots.
[02:02:55.841 --> 02:02:59.582]  But imagine if I walked up and I said, hey, you're part African or you're African.
[02:02:59.922 --> 02:03:01.462]  How about I just give you a crack pipe?
[02:03:01.482 --> 02:03:02.442]  They'd probably get mad.
[02:03:02.502 --> 02:03:02.943]  They should.
[02:03:03.203 --> 02:03:04.763]  I mean, it just doesn't make sense.
[02:03:07.003 --> 02:03:23.106]   And when it comes to the CIA, you could see that just after 2001 in Afghanistan, As soon as they went into Afghanistan, you can see on the graph that suddenly there's an epidemic of heroin addiction in the United States.
[02:03:23.206 --> 02:03:24.488]  It was like clockwork.
[02:03:25.249 --> 02:03:28.614]  It's clear that they were dumping those drugs on their own people.
[02:03:29.215 --> 02:03:29.956]  It's disgusting.
[02:03:30.416 --> 02:03:32.818]  And I can't believe that this is even a headline.
[02:03:32.878 --> 02:03:35.701]  It is a clown world we're living in now.
[02:03:36.722 --> 02:03:44.609]  I do want to say in the last minute though, if we can, I just want to warn everyone that it's not just going to be the carbon quota to stop you from traveling.
[02:03:44.989 --> 02:04:00.235]   What they can do with those QR codes is, for example, if you're on a list, so let's say you're protesting and you're on a list, say you're against the government, Your QR code, your digital ID is not going to work on public transport anymore.
[02:04:00.255 --> 02:04:02.477]  They're going to say you're not allowed in the city anymore.
[02:04:02.990 --> 02:04:09.953]  They're also going to say, for example, here in Australia they've introduced new laws that are called anti-association laws.
[02:04:10.453 --> 02:04:12.814]  So certain people can't associate with each other.
[02:04:12.834 --> 02:04:15.955]  And if they're caught, they can go to prison.
[02:04:15.975 --> 02:04:20.557]  They're saying that they're specifically targeting bikies or bikers.
[02:04:21.338 --> 02:04:28.801]  There's one about $50,000 fines, Australian dollar fines, if you're rude to the person that asks for your vaccine proof.
[02:04:30.948 --> 02:04:38.651]  Wow, well, imagine a scenario where in the future you go to a cafe and you both have digital IDs.
[02:04:39.111 --> 02:04:40.991]  You tag in with your QR codes.
[02:04:41.351 --> 02:04:45.213]  The government automatically knows that you're both at that cafe at the same time.
[02:04:45.673 --> 02:04:52.375]  And there's anti-association laws that if they deem that you shouldn't associate with each other, that could be illegal.
[02:04:52.835 --> 02:04:54.156]  Which is what this is all about.
[02:04:54.196 --> 02:04:55.516]  They admit that's what it's all about.
[02:04:55.536 --> 02:04:56.656]  This is so draconian.
[02:04:56.896 --> 02:04:59.578]   But this is really a response I really hope so.
[02:04:59.398 --> 02:05:03.438]   saying no to globalism, no to the left, no to the new world order. I see all this as
[02:05:03.438 --> 02:05:08.317]   a desperate gamble under their great reset to maintain control and I think it's backfiring.
[02:05:08.317 --> 02:05:10.438]  What do you think?
[02:05:10.438 --> 02:05:19.596]   I really hope so. I think that what I see in Canada with this convoy of truckers is
[02:05:19.596 --> 02:05:25.198]   so inspiring. But the fact that they've been there for two weeks and the government hasn't
[02:05:25.198 --> 02:05:32.197]   caved, it seems to me they're so married to pushing this through that they're really prepared
[02:05:32.197 --> 02:05:35.797]  to destroy Canada to get this digital idea established.
[02:05:35.829 --> 02:05:37.710]  But that's the point of the digital ID, exactly.
[02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:38.470]  That's the paradox.
[02:05:38.870 --> 02:05:50.873]  They want siege, the lockdowns, to crush the economy, so now truckers are taking over with their own peaceful siege, to point that out, but it actually makes the globalist happy in the end, unless we make it all about the Great Reset, and how, oh, you don't like our siege?
[02:05:51.153 --> 02:05:52.053]  You started the siege.
[02:05:52.293 --> 02:05:59.435]  I think if you use it as an educational system about the Great Reset, then they will back off, but it's important what the message is from the truckers.
[02:06:01.081 --> 02:06:07.389]  I think that the truckers are taking the siege out of the government's hands and they hate that because it's about control for them.
[02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:12.315]  They're saying that you want to siege the unvaccinated, how about everybody gets sieged?
[02:06:12.715 --> 02:06:15.178]  I think that it's a successful tactic.
[02:06:15.198 --> 02:06:21.001]   I realise that they don't, the The state doesn't care about whether or not they destroy their own economy.
[02:06:21.281 --> 02:06:24.001]  But the people might start to get annoyed about that.
[02:06:24.441 --> 02:06:27.322]  And I wonder what their reaction would be.
[02:06:27.602 --> 02:06:32.383]  My hope is that Trudeau just has to step down.
[02:06:32.783 --> 02:06:33.683]  That would be ideal.
[02:06:34.023 --> 02:06:37.283]  But I bet you he's on the phone with Karl Schwab every day.
[02:06:37.303 --> 02:06:46.045]  Because Karl Schwab was filmed admitting that he has Justin Trudeau in his pocket.
[02:06:47.506 --> 02:07:03.661]  The thing is that when it comes to disease and funding for cures, there's so many diseases that are so much worse and more deadly and this amount of funding never went to them.
[02:07:04.301 --> 02:07:05.663]  I just want to point that out.
[02:07:09.670 --> 02:07:13.670]   There have not been more cures found much faster if we could just throw money at it.
[02:07:13.670 --> 02:07:16.670]   Syria girl, I know it's the middle of the night or early morning for you, but look,
[02:07:16.670 --> 02:07:17.670]  we've got to go to break.
[02:07:17.670 --> 02:07:21.670]   Do five more minutes with us because I want to ask you about Klaus Schwab and the globalists.
[02:07:21.670 --> 02:07:22.670]  Thank you so much.
[02:07:22.670 --> 02:07:26.670]   And why they would brag about ruling cabinets and controlling prime ministers and leaders,
[02:07:26.670 --> 02:07:29.670]   including many of the prime ministers and presidents around the world.
[02:07:29.670 --> 02:07:30.670]  That's coming up.
[02:07:30.670 --> 02:07:35.670]   You can find her on Twitter @partisangirl, YouTube @syriangirlpartisan, and on Telegram
[02:07:35.670 --> 02:07:36.670]  @syriangirlpartisan.
[02:07:37.480 --> 02:07:39.362]  We'll be right back in about two minutes.
[02:07:39.402 --> 02:07:42.525]  But first off, ladies and gentlemen, I love Joe.
[02:07:42.545 --> 02:07:43.246]  He's a good friend of mine.
[02:07:43.266 --> 02:07:45.789]  We hung out for like six, seven hours the other night, and he's great.
[02:07:45.889 --> 02:07:48.692]  But Joe's got plenty of money, and he's able to fund himself.
[02:07:49.753 --> 02:07:51.976]  People like InfoWars, we're not able to.
[02:07:52.785 --> 02:07:55.786]  And they're trying to shut us down, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:56.266 --> 02:08:06.609]  And so, if we don't get your support, we will have to implode and we will have to really curtail our reach and our effect and all the great reporters like Greg Reese and, you know, Christy Lee and so many other people.
[02:08:07.089 --> 02:08:09.090]  And it took us decades to build this infrastructure.
[02:08:09.110 --> 02:08:09.970]  We need to keep it on air.
[02:08:10.290 --> 02:08:12.191]  Plus, we've got great products you need.
[02:08:12.731 --> 02:08:14.432]  So go to InfoWorksStore.com.
[02:08:14.852 --> 02:08:18.813]  The UN admits over 2 billion people have cognitive disabilities because of lack of iodine.
[02:08:19.651 --> 02:08:23.494]  It's so important for children, young people, adults, old people.
[02:08:23.934 --> 02:08:27.296]  We have X3, all three types of high-quality iodine.
[02:08:27.316 --> 02:08:29.618]  Deep Earth Iodine and two other types for $19.95.
[02:08:31.119 --> 02:08:32.059]  That's 50% off.
[02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:36.082]  This is absolutely pharmaceutical grade, highest quality.
[02:08:36.542 --> 02:08:39.704]  Infowarstore.com.

[02:08:40.285 --> 02:08:40.965]  That funds us.
[02:08:41.085 --> 02:08:46.008]  And, you know, I told them a week ago to end the sale on vitamin C and zinc, the megadose, and the whole food multivitamin.
[02:08:46.028 --> 02:08:46.389]  They didn't.
[02:08:46.929 --> 02:08:47.689]  It was about to sell out.
[02:08:47.729 --> 02:08:49.290]  I said, well, more than coming in for months.
[02:08:49.871 --> 02:08:50.451]  Take it off sale.
[02:08:50.471 --> 02:08:50.811]  They didn't.
[02:08:50.911 --> 02:08:52.452]  It's still on sale.
[02:08:52.472 --> 02:08:52.652]  40% off.
[02:08:53.053 --> 02:08:58.636]  Infowarstore.com and 25% off our entire catalog of the highest quality storable food ready to ship.

[02:09:00.637 --> 02:09:03.539]  At PrepareWithAlex.com or Infowarstore.com.
[02:09:03.779 --> 02:09:05.680]  And that's going to end on the evening of the 13th.
[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:11.063]  So you got two days to get 25% off of storable food now at Infowarstore.
[02:09:12.202 --> 02:09:15.565]  Alright, final segment with Syrian Girl, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:09:16.066 --> 02:09:26.376]  You made so many amazing points today, you've got to join us again sooner, as we track what's happening in Australia and across the world, but just big picture, what else would you like to tell the viewers that just love what you're doing?
[02:09:28.743 --> 02:09:30.624]  Well, thank you so much again.
[02:09:30.844 --> 02:09:36.906]  I want to talk about, you know, just to give you a picture of what's going on here a little bit again.
[02:09:38.127 --> 02:09:41.808]  We have, one of the mandates is that you're not allowed to buy alcohol.
[02:09:41.828 --> 02:09:46.590]  So you're not allowed to go into a store and an alcohol shop and buy alcohol.
[02:09:47.050 --> 02:09:50.952]  However, there's a supermarket called Aldi's here that also sells alcohol.
[02:09:51.730 --> 02:10:10.545]  You can go into the supermarket as an unvaccinated person and get, and this happened to, like, as I witnessed this today, you can go into the shop, you can grab whatever food you want, but if you go to the checkout and you've got alcohol, they will refuse to serve you to purchase that alcohol.
[02:10:10.925 --> 02:10:14.028]  So how does that prevent the virus from spreading?
[02:10:14.048 --> 02:10:14.468]  What's the sign?
[02:10:14.488 --> 02:10:15.029]  It doesn't.
[02:10:15.049 --> 02:10:16.290]  They admit it's a punishment.
[02:10:16.350 --> 02:10:20.113]  It's getting everybody used to the mark of the beast, the holy grail of control.
[02:10:22.361 --> 02:10:26.405]  Yeah, you know, there's no question about it.
[02:10:26.505 --> 02:10:30.449]  It's not about science and yet they keep trying to use science as a shield.
[02:10:30.750 --> 02:10:33.853]  I feel like they're degrading the entire idea of science.
[02:10:34.734 --> 02:10:39.799]  The fact that the vaccine is obviously admitted doesn't stop the spread.
[02:10:40.099 --> 02:10:46.345]   The head of our state here, the Premier, he actually said Getting two jobs?
[02:10:46.806 --> 02:10:51.170]  Well, it's only 4% effective against getting the coronavirus.
[02:10:51.390 --> 02:10:53.692]  So you've got to get the third job.
[02:10:53.752 --> 02:10:54.753]  They call it the job year.
[02:10:54.773 --> 02:10:55.053]  I don't know.
[02:10:55.213 --> 02:11:01.999]  Oh, I meant to ask you as a chemist and a former Pfizer employee, watching all the data come out of the deaths and the disease, what do you think is really going on here?
[02:11:03.840 --> 02:11:06.563]  I don't even think that we're getting all of the data yet.
[02:11:07.825 --> 02:11:15.314]  I have heard, although I have no confirmation of this, that there are some batches that are different than others.
[02:11:15.334 --> 02:11:22.583]  The batches are all mixed in one vat and then they're filled and then they're tested afterwards.
[02:11:23.945 --> 02:11:24.425]  I don't know.
[02:11:24.566 --> 02:11:30.194]  I've heard some batches cause more side effects than others and some batches maybe just like mild.
[02:11:30.234 --> 02:11:33.799]  Well sure, they're not following the regular protocols of past production.
[02:11:33.819 --> 02:11:35.341]  I know you worked in it and they used to though.
[02:11:35.361 --> 02:11:36.783]  They've been very secretive.
[02:11:38.647 --> 02:11:39.367]  Yes, exactly.
[02:11:39.407 --> 02:11:40.648]  So we really have no idea.
[02:11:40.948 --> 02:11:42.309]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[02:11:43.029 --> 02:11:50.233]  But in terms of the side effects, you know, they themselves, they pulled AstraZeneca from the market.
[02:11:50.513 --> 02:11:58.338]  So it's like, it's rather that they admit that there's side effects, but they're basically saying that the virus is so bad that it's worth it.
[02:11:58.538 --> 02:12:06.222]  Well, here in Australia, the virus has a mortality rate of 0.1%, or less if I understand.
[02:12:08.343 --> 02:12:10.564]  So there's no explanation.
[02:12:10.784 --> 02:12:12.585]  I mean, especially because it's Omicron.
[02:12:12.625 --> 02:12:14.026]  And we're not allowed to say this anymore.
[02:12:14.046 --> 02:12:26.592]  We're not allowed to say that a coronavirus mutates and natural selection deems that the weaker strains are the ones that spread.
[02:12:26.952 --> 02:12:30.374]  Because the weaker strains are the ones that people don't know that they have.
[02:12:30.694 --> 02:12:32.695]  They walk around, they spread it.
[02:12:33.155 --> 02:12:38.256]  Naturally, when you have mutations, you're very likely going to get weaker and weaker strains.
[02:12:38.496 --> 02:12:40.497]  We may get an even weaker strain than Omicron.
[02:12:41.297 --> 02:12:47.738]  The British, they even said like 40% of colds in the UK right now are going to be Omicron.
[02:12:48.098 --> 02:12:52.139]  So I wonder if they're going to be able to push this digital ID stuff.
[02:12:52.419 --> 02:12:55.320]  Before it becomes obvious to everyone, this is a joke.
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:56.721]  That is the question.
[02:12:57.341 --> 02:13:19.738]  Of course we are, I just heard, I just got a tweet, a telegram message that we are having a convoy here in my state and I want to plug again, you know, the police here, some of them have refused to do the bidding of the World Economic Forum and they are suing the government.
[02:13:19.758 --> 02:13:22.820]  Yeah, same thing in Canada and a bunch of places.
[02:13:23.220 --> 02:13:25.862]  We had a bunch of first responders block the Brooklyn Bridge yesterday.
[02:13:26.282 --> 02:13:28.804]  So again, they're trying to purge the police and military.
[02:13:28.824 --> 02:13:29.884]  They're good people with these shots.
[02:13:30.345 --> 02:13:31.845]  The police and military are not our enemy.
[02:13:32.186 --> 02:13:34.107]  It is the globalists on top of the policies that are.
[02:13:34.487 --> 02:13:40.491]  And just like Syria defeated al-Qaeda and the globalists, Syrian girl, I believe humanity will defeat this right now together.
[02:13:42.253 --> 02:13:49.097]  Well, we have you on our side, so you're one of the strongest cards against them, and keep playing what you do.
[02:13:49.137 --> 02:13:50.838]  Well, Syrian Girl, we got you and we love you.
[02:13:50.878 --> 02:13:52.259]  Come back on all the shows soon.
[02:13:52.619 --> 02:13:53.780]  Talk to us again, and God bless you.
[02:13:53.800 --> 02:13:54.940]  Give us an update in a week if you can do it.
[02:13:54.980 --> 02:13:55.320]  Thank you.
[02:13:55.781 --> 02:13:57.161]  Alright, Jadar takes over.
[02:13:57.181 --> 02:13:58.182]  I got a few other things to hit.
[02:13:58.502 --> 02:13:58.922]  Straight ahead.
[02:13:58.762 --> 02:14:13.361]  Thank you, Syrian Girl.
[02:14:13.333 --> 02:14:22.727]  Now it is easier than ever to take in the new liquid form with 8 beneficial super ingredients, BrainForce Ultra is the result of years of enhanced formulation.
[02:14:22.947 --> 02:14:28.290]  Free of toxic additives, each ingredient is specifically selected for its many key properties.
[02:14:28.690 --> 02:14:40.456]  Some of the proprietary super-ingredients behind BrainForce Ultra include Gorana Seed, which is loaded with energy compounds and antioxidants that have been used by Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[02:14:40.757 --> 02:14:46.240]  Alpha-GPC, a natural compound found in the brain that delivers an essential nutrient, Choline.
[02:14:46.600 --> 02:14:50.702]  And Ginkgo Leaf, which is also known for its exceptional antioxidant content.
[02:14:50.942 --> 02:14:53.323]  You know, I've got a new term for the Deep State Democrats.
[02:14:53.343 --> 02:14:54.244]  They really are murderous comedians.
[02:14:54.104 --> 02:14:57.204]  as well so you know it's packed full of the good stuff.
[02:14:57.204 --> 02:15:01.983]   Destroy that brain fog today and secure your bottle of Brain Force Ultra before it
[02:15:01.983 --> 02:15:07.804]   is completely sold out at M4Store.com. You know I've got a new term for the
[02:15:07.804 --> 02:15:13.864]   deep state Democrats. They really are murderous comedians. I mean they've
[02:15:13.864 --> 02:15:17.454]   got control of the law enforcement, the government, the bureaucracy, the
[02:15:17.454 --> 02:15:22.443]   prisons, the AI, all of it and it's the Democrats that got double along with
[02:15:22.443 --> 02:15:26.204]   Republicans double and triple jail time for black people that smoke crack.
[02:15:26.478 --> 02:15:30.299]  But white people with regular cocaine, the same amount, wouldn't get in trouble, basically.
[02:15:30.919 --> 02:15:33.400]  You'd get a 30, 40 year sentence first time for crack.
[02:15:33.420 --> 02:15:35.321]  You'd get probation for cocaine.
[02:15:36.581 --> 02:15:40.042]  The CIA created the crack recipe, put it on the street.
[02:15:40.442 --> 02:15:47.343]  That was declassified in 1996, 1997 C-SPAN hearings with the CIA Inspector General admitting it.
[02:15:47.824 --> 02:15:50.820]   But here's then-Senator Yes, it's a real story.
[02:15:50.659 --> 02:15:56.019]   puppet president talking about crack, then we've got his son on crack in the recordings
[02:15:56.019 --> 02:16:00.819]   at the time smoking crack and then later smoking crack and recently smoking crack and guns
[02:16:00.819 --> 02:16:06.559]   illegally and being a Chinese agent and being on the Ukraine payroll and the Russian payroll.
[02:16:06.559 --> 02:16:07.559]  That's all okay.
[02:16:07.559 --> 02:16:09.979]  Then why am I raising this?
[02:16:09.979 --> 02:16:11.420]  Yes, it's a real story.
[02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:13.498]  Covered it three days ago.
[02:16:13.498 --> 02:16:15.899]  Families called me, neighbors, people at stores.
[02:16:15.899 --> 02:16:16.659]  Is it true?
[02:16:17.053 --> 02:16:18.474]  They're handing out crack pipes.
[02:16:18.934 --> 02:16:23.716]  They're not just doing that to fight racism, they're giving them to black people.
[02:16:26.298 --> 02:16:29.039]  I mean, can you imagine the black folks working at this place?
[02:16:29.079 --> 02:16:30.500]  You're black, you need a crack pipe.
[02:16:31.494 --> 02:16:33.836]  I mean, I mean, that'd be crazy if you were walking with a watermelon.
[02:16:34.036 --> 02:16:35.557]  Hey, you're black, you want a watermelon?
[02:16:35.817 --> 02:16:42.022]  I mean, I mean, I mean, you can't, people, it's just, I mean, folks, these people are nuts, man.
[02:16:42.042 --> 02:16:45.405]  They sent convicted pedophiles to schools to have kids sit on their lap!
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:48.520]  I mean, I ought to try that.
[02:16:48.540 --> 02:16:51.981]  I ought to just drive somewhere, see a black guy, pull over, hey, I got a crack pipe for you.
[02:16:52.241 --> 02:16:52.861]  I love you.
[02:16:53.201 --> 02:16:53.821]  I'm Joe Biden.
[02:16:54.041 --> 02:16:54.902]  Joe Biden's delivered.
[02:16:54.962 --> 02:16:55.602]  I mean, what?
[02:16:56.722 --> 02:16:57.682]  I'm sorry.
[02:16:57.762 --> 02:16:59.603]  I shouldn't even laugh at this.
[02:16:59.623 --> 02:17:08.265]  $30 million in crack pipes as part of a racial equity fund delivered to black people.
[02:17:08.665 --> 02:17:10.425]  White people, you don't get a crack pipe.
[02:17:12.906 --> 02:17:13.626]  I shouldn't laugh.
[02:17:13.826 --> 02:17:14.686]  Here, here, here's a clip.
[02:17:15.723 --> 02:17:24.122]  A piece of crack cocaine, no bigger than this quarter that I'm holding in my hand.
[02:17:24.663 --> 02:17:25.906]  One quarter of one dollar.
[02:17:26.792 --> 02:17:38.137]  We passed a law through the leadership of Senator Thurman and myself and others, a law that says if you're caught with that, you go to jail for five years.
[02:17:38.878 --> 02:17:40.458]  You get no probation.
[02:17:41.299 --> 02:17:45.861]  You get nothing other than five years in jail.
[02:17:45.881 --> 02:17:46.841]  Because he wants it all for himself.
[02:17:46.861 --> 02:17:48.022]  The judge doesn't have a choice.
[02:17:48.582 --> 02:18:07.756]   Under our forfeiture statutes, You can, the government can, take everything you own, everything from your car to your house, your bank account, not merely what they confiscate in terms of the dollars from the transaction that you just got caught engaging in.
[02:18:07.776 --> 02:18:09.117]  They can take everything!
[02:18:09.797 --> 02:18:12.179]  I don't care why they become a sociopath.
[02:18:12.859 --> 02:18:17.283]  We have an obligation to cordon them off from the rest of society.
[02:18:17.603 --> 02:18:18.864]  They are in jail!
[02:18:20.822 --> 02:18:24.825]  Away from my mother, your husband, our families.
[02:18:25.485 --> 02:18:29.028]  So I don't want to ask, what made them do this?
[02:18:29.728 --> 02:18:32.410]  They must be taken off the street.
[02:18:34.392 --> 02:18:35.092]  But not Hunter.
[02:18:35.552 --> 02:18:38.434]  He gets to sell panties for $5 million, the Chinese as a payoff.
[02:18:39.315 --> 02:18:40.716]  It's all part of the sick joke.
[02:18:41.096 --> 02:18:44.018]  Of course, you know Biden smokes crack, Biden screws little kids.
[02:18:44.419 --> 02:18:45.759]  Both, all of them.
[02:18:45.779 --> 02:18:46.980]  It's literally a pedophile family.
[02:18:47.220 --> 02:18:47.801]  It's all come out.
[02:18:48.562 --> 02:18:51.223]  So that's, I mean, you're like, well, these people are nuts.
[02:18:51.263 --> 02:18:52.384]  Yeah, they're fricking pedophiles.
[02:18:52.484 --> 02:18:54.505]  I mean, you know, they screw little kids.
[02:18:55.586 --> 02:18:56.246]  They're crackheads.
[02:18:56.326 --> 02:18:56.646]  I mean, yeah.
[02:18:57.827 --> 02:19:00.028]  Like, why would a crackhead put other crackheads in jail?
[02:19:00.268 --> 02:19:01.709]  Because they get money off of it.
[02:19:01.729 --> 02:19:02.329]  That's why.
[02:19:03.129 --> 02:19:04.010]  These are demons.
[02:19:04.770 --> 02:19:06.591]  Here's Tucker Carlson last night talking about it.
[02:19:07.772 --> 02:19:09.613]  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson.
[02:19:09.633 --> 02:19:11.213]  Tonight, we've got news for you this evening.
[02:19:11.253 --> 02:19:16.276]  Joe Biden, the president, has announced another piece of his highly promoted equity agenda.
[02:19:16.776 --> 02:19:20.179]  That's the government-wide effort to improve the lives of African Americans.
[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:27.486]  You may recall that on his first day in office, more than a year ago, the new president explained that equity will require determination and creativity.
[02:19:27.506 --> 02:19:28.867]  And this week, he proved that's true.
[02:19:29.407 --> 02:19:33.190]  Joe Biden's latest idea is to pay black people to smoke more crack.
[02:19:33.971 --> 02:19:43.595]  Going forward, the administration will send at least $30 million in tax money to nonprofits and local governments so they can purchase, quote, safe smoking kits and supplies.
[02:19:44.295 --> 02:19:52.799]  According to HHS, these kits will contain Joe Biden-approved pipes that will allow beneficiaries of the equity agenda to smoke crack cocaine as well as crystal meth.
[02:19:53.826 --> 02:19:54.926]  Some say it's about time.
[02:19:55.647 --> 02:20:03.529]  Soros-aligned NGOs have long complained that marginalized groups in this country don't have adequate access to illegal narcotics or the tools to use them.
[02:20:04.110 --> 02:20:07.451]  With this new program, Joe Biden will finally close the crack gap.
[02:20:08.071 --> 02:20:12.533]  For too long in America, quality crack pipes have been the domain of rich white men, like so much else.
[02:20:12.673 --> 02:20:16.314]  Here's the President's son, for example, smoking crack in bed at the Four Seasons.
[02:20:16.914 --> 02:20:19.675]  You'll notice the beautifully designed custom crack pipe.
[02:20:20.096 --> 02:20:23.918]  It's cooling bowl nestled in the high thread count Egyptian cotton sheets.
[02:20:24.438 --> 02:20:27.139]  When Hunter Biden smokes crack, he does it in style.
[02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:29.881]  But not everyone in this country is so fortunate.
[02:20:30.421 --> 02:20:34.603]  Try to toast some rock in West Baltimore sometime, you may have to make the pipe yourself.
[02:20:35.103 --> 02:20:39.826]  From tinfoil or a broken car antenna, our inner cities are pipe deserts.
[02:20:41.887 --> 02:20:45.749]  But by the way, you still get the President's Senate for the crack, because we give you crack pipes, so...
[02:20:46.597 --> 02:20:50.917]   That's where we are ladies and gentlemen. Of course if you look into it I'm sure one of them gets a kickback from the
[02:20:50.917 --> 02:20:52.597]  30 million in crack pipes.
[02:20:52.597 --> 02:20:58.127]   I mean that just came out with the whole China situation and the Olympics and they're getting a bunch of money out
[02:20:58.127 --> 02:20:58.597]  of all that.
[02:20:58.597 --> 02:21:03.597]   Here's the last thing I'm going to hit ahead of. I'm just blowing away right now. Sorry.
[02:21:03.795 --> 02:21:04.555]  That's just unbelievable.
[02:21:05.256 --> 02:21:08.358]  Here's the last thing I'm going to hit ahead of Jay Dyer taking over here in just a few minutes.
[02:21:09.139 --> 02:21:14.103]  This is growth of climate therapy for eco-anxiety labeled rational by New York Times.
[02:21:14.483 --> 02:21:17.926]  Paul Watson wrote an article about it, pointed out people are committing suicide en masse.
[02:21:17.946 --> 02:21:20.388]  They're totally depressed because they believe the end of the world's coming.
[02:21:20.868 --> 02:21:22.710]  But, you know, they're believing their leaders.
[02:21:22.730 --> 02:21:29.555]  There's a broken social compact here, a social agreement, the social construct.
[02:21:30.672 --> 02:21:35.377]  And they really believe when world leaders tell them the world's ending it is, so they're scared.
[02:21:36.037 --> 02:21:36.638]  So I get it.
[02:21:36.678 --> 02:21:38.139]  We can blame and make fun of the left.
[02:21:38.800 --> 02:21:43.564]  They hand out Play-Doh at college and construction paper if someone gets upset.
[02:21:43.584 --> 02:21:46.086]  They have little short tables in the dean's office everywhere.
[02:21:46.347 --> 02:21:47.768]  And they come and pretend to be children.
[02:21:48.128 --> 02:21:55.175]  Obviously it's mass mental illness, but they are teaching children the world's ending, so as in any surprise they turn into basket cases.
[02:21:55.535 --> 02:21:56.376]  Here's an example of it.
[02:21:57.421 --> 02:22:00.482]  Now to a dire warning about climate change.
[02:22:01.942 --> 02:22:02.842]  A dire warning.
[02:22:04.403 --> 02:22:05.243]  A dire new warning.
[02:22:05.263 --> 02:22:06.083]  A dire warning.
[02:22:06.143 --> 02:22:07.164]  Another dire warning.
[02:22:07.184 --> 02:22:08.564]  The situation is dire.
[02:22:09.004 --> 02:22:09.904]  A dire warning.
[02:22:09.924 --> 02:22:11.125]  Dire consequences.
[02:22:11.165 --> 02:22:12.245]  A dire warning.
[02:22:12.285 --> 02:22:13.185]  It sounds dire.
[02:22:13.245 --> 02:22:14.605]  What prompted this warning?
[02:22:14.665 --> 02:22:16.506]  We have a global emergency.
[02:22:18.021 --> 02:22:22.224]  It's here, it's man-made, and there are going to be dire results.
[02:22:22.244 --> 02:22:28.469]  The government issued its most dramatic report yet about climate change today, and it came with a dire warning.
[02:22:28.549 --> 02:22:29.550]  A stark warning.
[02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:31.632]  A warning to humanity.
[02:22:31.652 --> 02:22:35.495]  An existential threat to human civilization on this planet.
[02:22:35.635 --> 02:22:39.458]  Experts say that we have until 2030 to avoid catastrophe.
[02:22:39.598 --> 02:22:45.542]  And we, the scientists also tell us, have 12 years in which to answer that question.
[02:22:45.562 --> 02:22:47.644]  12 years in which to ask.
[02:22:49.548 --> 02:22:52.893]  The world is gonna end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[02:22:53.053 --> 02:22:55.396]  We have 12 years to turn this around.
[02:22:55.556 --> 02:22:58.540]  By the year 2030, that's just 12 years from now.
[02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:01.744]  The future is closer than we think and is not good.
[02:23:01.885 --> 02:23:04.228]  There will be irreversible damage to the planet.
[02:23:05.128 --> 02:23:09.589]  Time is running out to prevent global warming from reaching a catastrophic milestone.
[02:23:09.649 --> 02:23:10.750]  Sea levels rising.
[02:23:10.850 --> 02:23:11.570]  Extreme drought.
[02:23:11.610 --> 02:23:12.510]  Severe storms.
[02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:15.231]  Widespread fires and extreme flooding.
[02:23:15.331 --> 02:23:16.531]  Dangerous heatwaves.
[02:23:16.551 --> 02:23:17.071]  Rising sea levels.
[02:23:17.091 --> 02:23:19.952]  Raising sea levels and forcing millions from their homes.
[02:23:19.972 --> 02:23:22.392]  Crop failure and mass population movements.
[02:23:22.412 --> 02:23:23.513]  As well as food shortages.
[02:23:23.613 --> 02:23:26.413]  Millions around the world face future disaster.
[02:23:26.593 --> 02:23:27.214]  Pretty serious.
[02:23:27.234 --> 02:23:28.334]  People are dying.
[02:23:28.354 --> 02:23:31.875]  President Trump has frequently doubted its existence and has called it a hoax.
[02:23:31.935 --> 02:23:32.755]  I don't believe it.
[02:23:34.804 --> 02:23:36.525]  The world is going to end in 12 years.
[02:23:38.746 --> 02:23:42.048]  Now, they're showing that to elementary school students for the last 15 years.
[02:23:42.108 --> 02:23:42.848]  Now they're adults.
[02:23:42.888 --> 02:23:43.909]  Now they're mental patients.
[02:23:44.309 --> 02:23:45.429]  Well, let's not blame them.
[02:23:45.469 --> 02:23:52.033]  Let's blame the criminals that lied to them and said by 2017, we'd have the sea levels up 15 feet in New York underwater.
[02:23:52.533 --> 02:23:54.774]  While the Clintons and everybody buy beachfront property.
[02:23:55.450 --> 02:23:56.070]  With Obama.
[02:23:56.411 --> 02:24:06.496]  This is brainwashing, but they're turning the food off with the COVID lockdowns and the chain reactions that is already killing 40 plus million people, and towards 2030 will depopulate if it continues.
[02:24:06.856 --> 02:24:14.380]  Thank God we're starting to push them back, but this is a war of inches, and that's why I need you all to share the articles and the videos, the info, and to keep doing it.
[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:15.181]  You're doing a great job.
[02:24:15.501 --> 02:24:16.241]  Your only hope.
[02:24:16.321 --> 02:24:17.522]  If you don't do it, nobody will.
[02:24:18.835 --> 02:24:26.360]  InfoWars has been so effective thanks to you, so please spread the word about the articles and videos, and please continue to support us at InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:24:34.985 --> 02:24:36.245]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[02:24:36.445 --> 02:24:39.667]  Prepare with Alex.com, our InfoWarsStore.com, ready to ship.
[02:24:40.308 --> 02:24:41.488]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:41.508 --> 02:24:43.810]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:24:44.853 --> 02:24:50.175]  Today we're going to lecture through another one of the global elite texts that we have not really covered yet.
[02:24:50.235 --> 02:24:56.277]  And it's really important because it was written in 2006 and it's written by the guy who's known as the Kissinger of France.
[02:24:56.737 --> 02:25:00.639]  His name is Jacques Attali and his book is A Brief History of the Future.
[02:25:00.659 --> 02:25:10.522]  So he's one of the architects of the modern war on terror, plays a really important role in globalism in the realm of European politics.
[02:25:11.222 --> 02:25:20.343]   And so in this 2006 book, He wrote about projections for the next few decades, where we would be in 2020, 2030, and 2050.
[02:25:21.343 --> 02:25:31.246]  It's one of the most important Global Elite texts of recent note that I can recall for how many accurate predictions and discussions this book has.
[02:25:31.626 --> 02:25:43.876]   Now, he says back in the early chapters of this book in 2006 that To understand where we're going in the fourth industrial revolution using some of the same ideology and terminology of Klaus Schwab in his 2018 book.
[02:25:46.485 --> 02:26:06.950]  Atali says that we have to look back to understand the progress of history in terms of the British East India Company, the Dutch East India Company, and how they really prepared the way for the corporate global model that we're going into now that's kind of coming live as a result of CUFID and all the nonsense the last few years.
[02:26:08.130 --> 02:26:17.695]  And what was interesting about these corporations is that they're the first kind of instances, you could argue the Vatican is an earlier version of this, of corporate governance.
[02:26:18.395 --> 02:26:27.280]  A private entity not accountable to anyone else, even less accountable than a king, is what we have with these private corporations.
[02:26:27.340 --> 02:26:33.503]  And so private corporations are not in any sense subject to public oversight or inquiry.
[02:26:34.776 --> 02:26:42.100]  He notes that the East India companies, they actually gave rise to the corporate control of every area of life.
[02:26:43.021 --> 02:26:52.487]  He uses examples like Henry Ford, the rise of the engine, and how that revolutionized society, put us into the rise of the machines, you could say.
[02:26:53.387 --> 02:27:04.056]   And the last industrial revolution, he says, is what prepares the way for the coming, Industrial Revolution, the fourth one, which is the Great Reset.
[02:27:04.578 --> 02:27:08.486]  So there you can see, of course, he's definitely in the circles of the World Economic Forum.
[02:27:08.526 --> 02:27:10.109]  He's in the Klaus circles for sure.
[02:27:11.798 --> 02:27:15.760]  And one thing that he says that technology would do is create an atomized society.
[02:27:15.800 --> 02:27:19.181]  He says that technology will give rise to what he calls nomadic objects.
[02:27:19.521 --> 02:27:21.882]  That is, objects like this right here, right?
[02:27:21.922 --> 02:27:23.703]  The cell phone is a nomadic object.
[02:27:24.143 --> 02:27:34.507]  And he says what the cell phone would do when this proliferates, remember he's writing this in 2006, 2005, before cell phones had become basically omnipresent.
[02:27:35.732 --> 02:27:41.978]  He says that many tech, miniature devices, portable devices, wearables, etc.
[02:27:42.679 --> 02:27:50.367]  will revolutionize society to the extent that we will no longer need or have the traditional human-to-human connections.
[02:27:50.527 --> 02:28:06.734]   So although technology can be a wonderful thing that makes life a lot easier, Even back then they were discussing how this would be a weapon, how we could weaponize these things to make people detach from their heritage, from their roots, from their tradition.
[02:28:07.655 --> 02:28:12.178]  And the internet and cell phone technology would be weaponized precisely in that way.
[02:28:12.759 --> 02:28:20.625]  He says that the rise of the internet coming out of DARPA, coming out of CERN, coming out of MIT, would totally change society.
[02:28:20.705 --> 02:28:23.227]  We would never go back to the way that we were before.
[02:28:24.326 --> 02:28:30.547]  And he says that this liberalism is a liberalism that ultimately is revolutionary in a destructive sense.
[02:28:31.247 --> 02:28:53.532]  Now, again, the point here is not to say that technology is inherently bad or that capitalism is inherently bad in terms of owning your business or property or whatever, but he says that we could revolutionize and weaponize all of these technologies and these ideologies to destroy the existing order to bring forth from, like a phoenix from the ashes, a new order.
[02:28:54.292 --> 02:28:57.814]  And he mentions giant megacities, things like L.A., D.C.
[02:28:57.834 --> 02:29:04.919]  He says the future will be super gigantic, super megacities where people will be forced into these cities.
[02:29:05.059 --> 02:29:07.861]  This is within pages, the first hundred pages.
[02:29:07.941 --> 02:29:24.711]   He says by 2025 to 2040, he says China will become a new superpower that will be the model for the gigantic megacities, like the cities that we see in China, the gigantic, you know, high-rises, the people stacked into the apartment buildings
[02:29:24.711 --> 02:29:25.191]  and whatnot.
[02:29:25.191 --> 02:29:30.071]   He says this is what is going to be the future where you'll be forced into these megacities
[02:29:30.071 --> 02:29:32.071]  that will eventually be smart cities.
[02:29:32.071 --> 02:29:38.231]   He says the only way that we're going to have these megacities, as he mentions this on pages
[02:29:38.231 --> 02:29:46.711]   118, 119, is if we can first inculcate people with nomadic devices such that they are detached
[02:29:46.711 --> 02:29:48.990]  from their roots.
[02:29:48.990 --> 02:29:56.830]   So the rootless consumer will be much more malleable, much more able to be engineered
[02:29:56.830 --> 02:29:59.870]  into living in the gigantic megacities.
[02:30:00.731 --> 02:30:13.456]  And this process is going to take many decades, he says, but eventually the rootless consumer who's packed into the megacities, yeah, exactly like the movie Dread, where the people living in gigantic high-rises like peach trees, right?
[02:30:13.836 --> 02:30:20.719]  And everybody's, each high-rise is run by a different organized crime syndicate that sells everybody drugs in that high-rise, right?
[02:30:22.139 --> 02:30:27.760]  He says that everybody will be packed into coffin apartments.
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:28.761]  He actually says this.
[02:30:28.801 --> 02:30:43.204]  He says the advantages of this will be that the rootless consumers, the rootless bug men, will consume their way into giant high-rises where everybody can just basically have sex and live in their coom pods.
[02:30:43.484 --> 02:30:44.144]  Again, I'm not joking.
[02:30:44.164 --> 02:30:45.285]  He says this on pages 120 to 125.
[02:30:48.166 --> 02:31:01.316]   He says that there will be some kind of universal basic income doled out to people where they will willingly accept this because they won't have to worry about You know, finding some job and making some minimum wage income.
[02:31:01.856 --> 02:31:18.267]  He says that crucial to this will be 5G, and 5G going global will allow by 2030 everyone to be packed into the megacities, living in their coon pods, getting a UBI and basically just watching Netflix or watching something on the metaverse or whatever.
[02:31:19.927 --> 02:31:22.809]  I know that people have thought that this is outlandish.
[02:31:22.929 --> 02:31:24.851]  You know, we've talked about this for many, many years.
[02:31:25.271 --> 02:31:28.793]  Alex has talked about it for at least 25, 30 years or so.
[02:31:28.873 --> 02:31:36.279]  I've talked about this since 2004 or 5, because many movies were actually showing us this, preparing us for The Matrix.
[02:31:37.339 --> 02:31:41.902]  Tiny Living, all of that is being promoted to promote the idea of austerity.
[02:31:42.003 --> 02:31:54.658]   You not having your own business, you not Building anything, having a family, none of that, you will be a rootless consumer controlled by the base passions, controlled by eating the bugs and living in the coon pod at night.
[02:31:56.112 --> 02:32:03.098]  Another interesting element is he predicted back in 2006, he says the next phase to come would be global live streaming.
[02:32:03.318 --> 02:32:06.220]  Now, again, nothing inherently wrong with having live streams.
[02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:08.142]  We do live streams all the time at my channel.
[02:32:08.602 --> 02:32:14.587]  But the point is that he says that what live streaming will do is take over entertainment.
[02:32:15.408 --> 02:32:21.413]  So he's literally talking about, yeah, what you see in that classic Black Mirror episode where you're stuck in a little pod.
[02:32:22.193 --> 02:32:26.755]  You can't turn off the pop-ups and the ads that constantly come at you.
[02:32:26.955 --> 02:32:38.601]  You have to, you know, generate some kind of UBI on the basis of, you know, scrolling through ads or who knows what, you know, clicking pop-ups is going to be how you make a living in the future.
[02:32:38.661 --> 02:32:43.723]  I don't know, but he says that this will be connected to the gamification of society.
[02:32:44.244 --> 02:32:53.596]   And once everything is gamified, then everyone will be on this universal basic income And they will not have any incentives anymore to have children or offspring.
[02:32:53.957 --> 02:33:03.713]  Literally the next chapter is that, where he talks about how this will give mass depopulation the incentive that's needed where people themselves will not want to have offspring or have families.
[02:33:04.733 --> 02:33:09.115]  So this is what is a great book for showing this is an overall plan.
[02:33:09.615 --> 02:33:14.857]  Everything that's happening that rolls out every one of the every decade is part of this overall plan.
[02:33:15.157 --> 02:33:15.817]  This book was written in 2006.
[02:33:15.897 --> 02:33:18.258]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:18.298 --> 02:33:19.498]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:33:19.959 --> 02:33:20.619]  Jay's analysis.
[02:33:20.639 --> 02:33:21.779]  You can find me on YouTube.
[02:33:21.799 --> 02:33:23.340]  You can find me over on Rockfin.
[02:33:23.940 --> 02:33:25.701]  Great free speech based platform.
[02:33:25.721 --> 02:33:28.902]  You can find all of my videos here as well at Alex's site.
[02:33:30.443 --> 02:33:43.681]   And I want to Go back to what we were seeing in Jacques Attali's famous book from 2006, Brief History of the Future, where he's showing what the global elite have outlined for us in this dystopian future.
[02:33:43.700 --> 02:33:48.539]   And it literally gets explicitly dystopian because we're only halfway into the book and
[02:33:48.539 --> 02:33:55.020]   he's already talking about the mass movements of populations into various areas as a form
[02:33:55.020 --> 02:34:01.820]   of reengineering those societies to create, he says, ultimately in the world, 30 major
[02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:03.500]  population center megacities.
[02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:09.120]   So the idea is to get rid of nation states, to get rid of countries and integrate them
[02:34:09.120 --> 02:34:12.219]  into 30 different megacity regions.
[02:34:12.202 --> 02:34:18.004]  The megacities will be controlled by ultimately things like AI in a top-down way.
[02:34:18.064 --> 02:34:20.985]  And the algorithms will run and control everything.
[02:34:21.445 --> 02:34:29.508]  Down to whether you can have this much kibble in your bowl, whether you can have this much electricity that week, whether you're allowed to do this or that.
[02:34:29.528 --> 02:34:33.670]  And if you say the wrong naughty words, you will of course not get your UBI.
[02:34:34.310 --> 02:34:38.451]  So people are going to sign on to this thinking that this is some kind of free ride.
[02:34:38.511 --> 02:34:39.231]  It's going to be amazing.
[02:34:39.251 --> 02:34:39.851]  It's going to be great.
[02:34:39.891 --> 02:34:48.873]  It's going to be like in Blade Runner, the original Blade Runner, the gigantic mega city hellhole where everybody's living in slums and it's a nightmare.
[02:34:49.273 --> 02:34:58.035]  But everybody was duped into this because they were going to get, they thought, free income, UBI, and I could just lay around and watch porn all day.
[02:34:58.735 --> 02:35:18.139]   No, illegal Excuse me, the mass immigration, it says, will be a weapon to totally re-engineer all regions such that there will be nothing but the identity that you have via your consumer choices that are given to you via the pop culture.
[02:35:19.858 --> 02:35:37.672]   He says that we have to do this because we need a mass depopulation due to the greenhouse gases and too many life forms that are eating up all of the precious resources and The carbon, there's too much carbon, right?
[02:35:38.173 --> 02:35:47.742]  Carbon, of course, is the basis of life, but pollution and not enough resources, he says, is going to have to result in this mass depop exercise.
[02:35:47.762 --> 02:35:53.721]   So between 2030 to 2050 is the key time when they have to bring down the population on
[02:35:53.721 --> 02:35:54.721]  a mass scale.
[02:35:54.721 --> 02:35:57.041]  He says that it's a race against time.
[02:35:57.041 --> 02:36:01.002]   All the global elite have the same pattern here, the same fear-mongering about it's a
[02:36:01.002 --> 02:36:02.561]  race against time, it's a crisis.
[02:36:02.561 --> 02:36:05.641]   If we don't kill everybody right now, then humanity will not survive.
[02:36:05.641 --> 02:36:09.202]   Of course, this is all a ploy, it's all a lie, it's all a scam.
[02:36:09.202 --> 02:36:10.202]  Scams within scams.
[02:36:10.202 --> 02:36:15.322]   But it's amazing how many people, especially amongst Gen Z and millennials, are buying
[02:36:15.322 --> 02:36:18.682]  into the tiny living and into the scam.
[02:36:18.682 --> 02:36:20.922]  And they believe the carbon climate crap.
[02:36:20.966 --> 02:36:26.590]  That's why now the narrative about the COVID has shifted to climate lockdowns.
[02:36:26.831 --> 02:36:27.811]  That's what they've been pushing.
[02:36:28.292 --> 02:36:32.615]  Climate lockdowns are necessary because humans are using up all the resources.
[02:36:33.195 --> 02:36:42.932]   And the whole Goal behind pushing people into the megacities is precisely to give the impression that there's not enough space, there's not enough resources.
[02:36:43.492 --> 02:36:56.683]   When everybody's packed into gigantic megacities, he says 30 megacities across the globe, it will be all the more easier to convince those people That there's not enough resources and there's too many humans.
[02:36:57.303 --> 02:37:02.124]  Even though the planet is gigantic, there's plenty of space for more and more humans.
[02:37:02.884 --> 02:37:23.318]   But this corporate control and restructuring of cities and city planning, getting rid of the nation state, getting rid of the older models of governance and local government, Gives the impression and gives these centralized entities the power to shut off your energy, shut off your water, shut off your resources.
[02:37:23.918 --> 02:37:28.981]  We're already getting the inklings of this and the threats of this, like we're being held hostage.
[02:37:29.401 --> 02:37:32.563]  When Klaus talks about, we will shut off the internet, right?
[02:37:32.583 --> 02:37:33.664]  There will be an end to the internet.
[02:37:33.684 --> 02:37:34.825]  There'll be an end of the power.
[02:37:34.885 --> 02:37:37.086]  The power grid is going to go and all these warnings and threats.
[02:37:39.916 --> 02:37:42.418]  All relate to this one plan.
[02:37:42.458 --> 02:37:45.421]  It is all one single coordinated plan.
[02:37:47.482 --> 02:37:56.990]  He says by 2025, the US will be in such a decline, there will be no jobs, there will be no opportunities, there will be no upward mobility.
[02:37:58.751 --> 02:37:59.452]  That's what he says.
[02:37:59.492 --> 02:38:05.377]  He says there will be new migrations such that the United States will completely reorganize.
[02:38:06.682 --> 02:38:11.886]  And the United States will lose its self-identity and its whole history and ethos.
[02:38:12.446 --> 02:38:19.812]  So it won't be known as this country of freedom, free enterprise, free speech, constitution, rule of law, etc.
[02:38:19.872 --> 02:38:21.253]  All of that will collapse.
[02:38:21.906 --> 02:38:36.537]  And he speculates that the new centers, the globalists have proposed various central cities for the new reconstituted collapsed United States will either be Los Angeles or something like Atlanta.
[02:38:36.578 --> 02:38:38.679]  They propose different cities at different times.
[02:38:39.420 --> 02:38:44.023]  And he says that essentially capitalism will, from within, eat itself.
[02:38:44.744 --> 02:38:47.206]  Monopoly capitalism that these guys run and control.
[02:38:48.032 --> 02:38:49.753]  And there will be an intentional collapse.
[02:38:50.294 --> 02:39:00.520]  He says that it's going to collapse, and they want it to collapse, because this will give rise to, get this, the future wave of the planetary empire.
[02:39:00.760 --> 02:39:01.521]  I'm not joking.
[02:39:01.881 --> 02:39:03.142]  That's the name of this chapter.
[02:39:03.162 --> 02:39:06.424]  The future wave of the planetary empire.
[02:39:07.552 --> 02:39:28.647]  And he says that philosophers and thinkers like Francis Fukuyama have predicted that we are at the end of history, and the end of history is the collapse and the end of the so-called democratic order that emerges out of the 20th century, which now gives rise, as it was intended to, to the new global order of the technocracy.
[02:39:29.627 --> 02:39:34.931]  This is where the book gets really, really wild, just like in Klaus's books, by the end is where they get really interesting.
[02:39:35.922 --> 02:39:42.707]  Atali's book towards the second half says 2050 will be the deconstruction of all nation-states.
[02:39:43.948 --> 02:39:47.751]  All nation-states by 2050 will be gone, deconstructed.
[02:39:47.771 --> 02:39:57.939]  There might be some husk of a thing that exists known as this or that country or that nation-state, but they are fully integrated into the global governance, he says.
[02:40:00.361 --> 02:40:10.236]   He says that the global middle class will eventually give rise to global Democracy, or what he calls hyper-democracy.
[02:40:10.657 --> 02:40:18.524]  So notice that democracy is all part of the scam, promoting the idea that you make your decisions, you're your own god, which it's not really, right?
[02:40:18.584 --> 02:40:34.292]   It's not really democracy, it's not really you doing this, but that is a selling point, a marketing point that they use, and they're going to, I'm not kidding, they're going to sell this Total top-down technocracy as the democratic technocracy, right?
[02:40:34.332 --> 02:40:37.173]  It'll be the people's AI government or something, right?
[02:40:37.394 --> 02:40:40.515]  And people will buy into it because it's just named the people's government.
[02:40:41.235 --> 02:40:49.259]  He says that the New World Order comes out of the death of the American system, and what will happen is that the entire world will convert.
[02:40:49.759 --> 02:40:52.120]  It's almost like he describes in religious terminology.
[02:40:52.440 --> 02:40:58.713]   There will be a conversion to Not just an Americanist order.
[02:40:58.973 --> 02:41:05.478]  The prevalence of the Pax Americana, he says, is just the preparation for the new phase.
[02:41:06.138 --> 02:41:18.347]  He says, basically, the snake will shed its skin and we'll find out that, oh, actually, the real government of the world is this global technocratic government that was intended to pop out of the snake's skin the whole time.
[02:41:19.247 --> 02:41:29.545]   He says it is, in fact, the usury debt-based hyper-predatory bubble economy that was inflated on purpose
[02:41:29.545 --> 02:41:30.655]  to collapse.
[02:41:30.655 --> 02:41:36.495]   He's saying that the existing market as it is, the dollar-based market, is intended to
[02:41:36.495 --> 02:41:41.774]  collapse and its collapse will destroy the United States.
[02:41:41.774 --> 02:41:44.734]  And he's saying that it's this way on purpose.
[02:41:44.734 --> 02:41:46.975]  So people don't get this.
[02:41:46.957 --> 02:41:51.579]  They think that all the world's run by a bunch of greedy people and I just want to make money.
[02:41:51.959 --> 02:41:54.360]  Yeah, but they don't need the money anymore.
[02:41:54.840 --> 02:41:56.401]  So they control the money printing.
[02:41:56.621 --> 02:41:57.602]  They don't need the money.
[02:41:58.702 --> 02:42:08.986]  He says that since everyone is a slave now, this is his words, to a debt based system that you can never get out of.
[02:42:09.727 --> 02:42:12.308]  The system is intended to self destruct.
[02:42:13.434 --> 02:42:16.417]  So that everyone can then be forced into a new system.
[02:42:17.078 --> 02:42:18.379]  So a lot of people don't understand this.
[02:42:18.439 --> 02:42:24.344]  That's a military technique to destroy the existing system on purpose to bring in a new system.
[02:42:24.404 --> 02:42:27.767]  People don't understand that people would want to destroy what exists.
[02:42:27.787 --> 02:42:30.550]  Okay, this is all slated to go away.
[02:42:30.590 --> 02:42:32.492]  And you've heard Alex saying this a lot recently.
[02:42:32.532 --> 02:42:35.915]  That's because these people have been saying it for decades.
[02:42:36.295 --> 02:42:40.896]  There's a whole book right here on this saying we will destroy the existing capitalist system.
[02:42:40.936 --> 02:42:42.116]  And he's a capitalist, okay?
[02:42:42.576 --> 02:42:48.738]  Jacques Attali is a hyper-capitalist in the sense of a hyper-democratic technocrat.
[02:42:49.458 --> 02:42:50.938]  So that just translates into that.
[02:42:51.018 --> 02:42:52.398]  That's what he means by that, okay?
[02:42:52.658 --> 02:42:54.179]  So this is not really about capitalism.
[02:42:54.239 --> 02:42:55.319]  It's about technocracy.
[02:42:55.719 --> 02:42:56.259]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:42:56.299 --> 02:42:59.180]  We're going to get into the really crazy stuff with nanotech when we come back.
[02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:00.580]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:43:00.620 --> 02:43:03.181]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:43:03.560 --> 02:43:08.120]   be sure and follow me on YouTube and the other social media platforms.
[02:43:08.120 --> 02:43:11.440]  My website's kind of undergoing some construction right now.
[02:43:11.440 --> 02:43:16.761]   But we were talking about Jacques Attali's book, Brief History of the Future, and we
[02:43:16.761 --> 02:43:20.200]   were going to the chapters where he's talking about the intentional self-destruction of
[02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:21.200]  the U.S.
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:27.540]   And then he says that what will then come into play in the 2030 to 2050 period will
[02:43:27.540 --> 02:43:29.880]  be the rise of the importance of nanotech.
[02:43:30.128 --> 02:43:44.792]  Nanotech will be crucial to erecting this new system, this is what they're bringing in, where now everything will be basically watched and eyed at all times by bots and nanotech within you watching you.
[02:43:45.352 --> 02:43:46.833]  He says these will be called watchers.
[02:43:47.513 --> 02:43:54.819]  And the watchers are going to keep track of everything that you do for insurance purposes, health purposes, data purposes.
[02:43:56.461 --> 02:44:00.845]  He makes a big deal about big tech and insurance having a role in this.
[02:44:01.628 --> 02:44:08.473]  And insurance and health care, he says, will be the key way in which this New World Order, his terminology, this New World Order will come into play.
[02:44:09.034 --> 02:44:10.995]  So what have we seen in the last two years?
[02:44:11.656 --> 02:44:16.359]  The importance of health care in the rise of the New World Order.
[02:44:16.419 --> 02:44:27.388]   We've seen now, as we covered with that recent transhumanist document from the British Ministry of Defense and from the German government, The idea that now the body is a security threat.
[02:44:27.748 --> 02:44:33.553]  So, biosecurity is now what has resulted from the last two years of nonsense and psyops.
[02:44:34.073 --> 02:44:42.200]  And that is all for this long-term goal of making human beings themselves now the global security threat.
[02:44:42.460 --> 02:44:44.621]  It's the human beings that are the pollutants.
[02:44:45.682 --> 02:44:47.604]  Carbon-based lifeforms, the pollutants.
[02:44:48.368 --> 02:44:57.077]  And he says that the healthcare system will be the system by which the technocracy will come to power and will determine who lives and who dies.
[02:44:58.538 --> 02:45:11.390]  The health system, he says, will function as an all-seeing eye to control, especially via nanotech, and even clothing, he says, will be nanofibers.
[02:45:11.471 --> 02:45:12.732]  You won't be able to escape this.
[02:45:13.863 --> 02:45:16.406]  He says that there will be a total control of all areas.
[02:45:16.446 --> 02:45:19.990]  This is, I mean, this is like just the next level dystopia.
[02:45:21.051 --> 02:45:23.653]  He says there won't be such a thing as celebrity culture.
[02:45:23.713 --> 02:45:26.416]  All of that will go away in the next few decades.
[02:45:27.898 --> 02:45:36.387]  He said everyone will police because their life will basically be dependent upon following these technocratic AI dictates.
[02:45:37.816 --> 02:45:40.617]  If you violate the dictates, you won't get healthcare.
[02:45:40.717 --> 02:45:43.879]  You won't get access to the services that you need to survive.
[02:45:44.739 --> 02:45:47.620]  He says that blood will become nano blood, smart blood.
[02:45:49.601 --> 02:45:56.224]  And he says that, um, really the idea of freedom won't even matter anymore because nobody's actually free anyway.
[02:45:56.764 --> 02:46:01.346]  And the elite have the right and the authority to determine what freedom means.
[02:46:01.966 --> 02:46:05.347]  So they are the high priests of evolution.
[02:46:05.387 --> 02:46:06.728]  They're the progenitors of this view.
[02:46:08.109 --> 02:46:17.775]  And he says that ultimately the existing system will eat itself, fall apart, and people will just accept this as the new normal.
[02:46:18.055 --> 02:46:19.496]  They will accept solitude.
[02:46:19.516 --> 02:46:20.437]  That's what he says.
[02:46:20.637 --> 02:46:22.578]  He says solitude will become the new normal.
[02:46:23.379 --> 02:46:23.699]  Wow!
[02:46:24.179 --> 02:46:30.663]  What have we been prepared for in the last few years with being alone, solitude, accepting this.
[02:46:30.783 --> 02:46:32.024]  Just go get in your pod.
[02:46:34.271 --> 02:46:51.385]  He wrote this in 2006 and he's saying that in the future you will be socially engineered to condition to accept loneliness, being atomized, solitude, and he says that they will do this through using big sports, global sports, and sex.
[02:46:53.207 --> 02:46:58.171]  The base passions will be the key to getting people to accepting their own self-destruction.
[02:47:01.021 --> 02:47:27.126]   He says that people will be turned into narcissists and they will be autistic, he says, which makes me think that they knew that they could cause autism on a mass level and that social media and these different things would cause people to be narcissists, which the tech heads, the people coming out of The tech companies in the last few years have admitted, oh yeah, by the way, sorry, we made everybody into narcissistic spurs who are crazy.
[02:47:27.686 --> 02:47:30.068]  We didn't mean to do that, but by the way, we did mean to do that.
[02:47:30.088 --> 02:47:31.049]  Sorry about that, by the way.
[02:47:32.189 --> 02:47:45.418]  Then this fascinating section where he talks about the market is a global brain like a golem creature that is made as an entity that isn't actually alive, but will be like it's alive.
[02:47:45.959 --> 02:47:46.480]  I'm not joking.
[02:47:46.520 --> 02:47:49.783]  He says that, and he says that the United States will collapse.
[02:47:50.224 --> 02:47:51.806]  It'll be integrated into the system.
[02:47:51.846 --> 02:47:58.113]  He says that one of the other key ways that will destroy the United States, he says this, is through sports.
[02:47:59.034 --> 02:48:06.503]  He says sports will be turned towards social engineering people to accept globalist ideas without even knowing it.
[02:48:07.344 --> 02:48:12.227]  Via the propaganda, the subliminals, and so forth, put into sports programming.
[02:48:12.567 --> 02:48:17.069]  What have we seen in the last several years of the Super Bowl ads, right?
[02:48:17.089 --> 02:48:22.532]  The propaganda, the programming present, and all this, the ridiculous professional sports nonsense.
[02:48:23.133 --> 02:48:32.738]  All of the promotion of the Stabbies and the Cufid nonsense, within sports, as the sports players all drop dead, nobody can figure out, oh, I wonder why that's happening?
[02:48:34.098 --> 02:48:41.315]   Atul East says that, We will remove all notion, for example, of reproduction from sexuality.
[02:48:41.355 --> 02:48:46.878]  Sexuality will become a complete pleasure-based recreational activity.
[02:48:48.579 --> 02:48:52.981]  And this will lead to, ultimately, the notion of no longer again having family.
[02:48:53.001 --> 02:48:55.843]  So the whole purpose of all of it, he says, is just to reduce population.
[02:48:55.883 --> 02:48:56.163]  That's it.
[02:48:57.958 --> 02:49:08.466]  Then he says that hopefully cloning technology will come into vogue and really work and we can convince people to accept cloning technology such that the elite will achieve immortality.
[02:49:08.526 --> 02:49:09.167]  That's what he says.
[02:49:09.227 --> 02:49:10.948]  Page 209, 210.
[02:49:11.869 --> 02:49:17.133]  After we've destroyed everybody through degeneracy and toxic culture, then we can come roll out the clones.
[02:49:17.753 --> 02:49:19.475]  I'm not saying that I know if that's true or not.
[02:49:19.515 --> 02:49:20.215]  That's what he says.
[02:49:20.255 --> 02:49:23.378]  He says hopefully by then, right, cloning will work.
[02:49:23.438 --> 02:49:26.120]  It'll be sufficiently advanced enough that it will work.
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:36.649]  And then he says, now we got to be prepared because, writing to his fellow, you know, travelers, fellow elites, we got to be prepared because there's going to be a reaction to this.
[02:49:36.829 --> 02:49:38.991]  Not everybody's going to want this or go along with this.
[02:49:39.471 --> 02:49:45.456]  So a lot of people are going to say, hey, globalism is destructive and it's destructive, not just to countries, but to the whole human race.
[02:49:47.038 --> 02:49:48.699]  He says, yes, they're right.
[02:49:48.899 --> 02:49:51.762]  And so we have to be ready for their counter revolution.
[02:49:52.757 --> 02:50:03.805]  And he says that entities like Christianity and Western religion especially are going to be the main source of counter-reaction revolution to our revolution.
[02:50:04.986 --> 02:50:05.727]  That's what he says.
[02:50:06.407 --> 02:50:14.554]   He says get ready because there's a chance, there's a danger that America could repent And become a Christian country.
[02:50:14.574 --> 02:50:15.414]  That's what he says.
[02:50:15.775 --> 02:50:29.325]  He says, that's my main concern is that when people figure this out, they will turn to Christianity and then we will have to deal with a battle for the soul of the West as people accept Christianity.
[02:50:31.187 --> 02:50:40.474]  He says, but we're going to have to deploy nanotech, GMO, and all sorts of next level weaponry.
[02:50:42.569 --> 02:50:44.890]  To take down and target this reaction.
[02:50:45.410 --> 02:50:51.012]  He says, I do not think that the reaction on the part of people who finally figure out what's going on will be enough.
[02:50:51.632 --> 02:50:53.373]  He says, I think we're going to win in the long run.
[02:50:53.493 --> 02:50:56.274]  But he speaks of this as a battle for the future.
[02:50:56.294 --> 02:50:56.954]  Do you understand that?
[02:50:57.474 --> 02:51:00.615]  The brief history of the future is about who will control the future.
[02:51:01.655 --> 02:51:13.636]   And he says, if he's speaking to his elite, if we play our cards right, Then we will eventually get the order that we're looking for, which he says is a transhumanist vanguard.
[02:51:14.456 --> 02:51:22.299]  He says the transhumanists today are the vanguard, the tip of the spear, the front line of the New World Order.
[02:51:22.759 --> 02:51:23.859]  It's got a whole chapter on that.
[02:51:23.879 --> 02:51:25.120]  That's the title.
[02:51:25.140 --> 02:51:26.360]  That's what that chapter is called.
[02:51:26.880 --> 02:51:30.301]  The vanguard of hyperdemocracy are the transhumanists.
[02:51:31.742 --> 02:51:34.903]  And he says that we are leading the fight.
[02:51:35.805 --> 02:51:38.407]  It's almost like he's using the terminology that Alex uses, right?
[02:51:38.427 --> 02:51:39.247]  The tip of the sphere.
[02:51:39.988 --> 02:51:42.549]  We're the front line in this battle.
[02:51:42.610 --> 02:51:45.692]  And he's saying that the transhumanists are the front line of this battle.
[02:51:46.372 --> 02:51:56.559]  And he says that we will continue to use NGOs, deep state apparatus, to continue to work towards this mass depopulation exercise.
[02:51:56.599 --> 02:51:58.880]  Just think how evil, how satanic this is.
[02:51:59.401 --> 02:52:05.985]   That they have to control and kill most of the world To bring in their anti-human agenda.
[02:52:07.625 --> 02:52:09.705]  Everybody's going to be crowded into the megacities.
[02:52:10.126 --> 02:52:16.147]  And he says that we may even have to hopefully unleash something like grey goo or black goo nanotech.
[02:52:16.187 --> 02:52:16.827]  He says this.
[02:52:18.847 --> 02:52:25.309]  To wipe out the people that don't go along in some sort of genetic specific bio release.
[02:52:27.009 --> 02:52:34.414]  And he says that if we can get this through, what will happen is we'll eventually have the global brain, which he calls a collective golem.
[02:52:36.135 --> 02:52:36.775]  That's his word.
[02:52:37.916 --> 02:52:41.398]  And then he says that hopefully maybe it'll even become conscious.
[02:52:41.518 --> 02:52:47.622]  The global brain might become active, but by then everybody will be assimilated into the Borg, like Star Trek.
[02:52:48.142 --> 02:52:51.425]  He says then we can have a utopia where there will be no more war.
[02:52:51.645 --> 02:52:52.205]  So there you go.
[02:52:52.245 --> 02:52:58.638]   The whole book is literally Echoing and saying the very same things that Klaus says in his Fourth Industrial Revolution.
[02:52:58.818 --> 02:53:02.221]  This book was written in 2006 by the Kissinger of France.
[02:53:03.261 --> 02:53:12.928]  Almost, what, 15, 16 years prior to all of the KUFID nonsense, which has done the very things that Attali says it would do.
[02:53:13.449 --> 02:53:20.694]  That we would engineer the future civilization to accept being alone, living in the megacity pods and dying.
[02:53:21.454 --> 02:53:22.195]  Get in your pod.
[02:53:22.981 --> 02:53:24.462]  Eat the bugs and just die.
[02:53:24.902 --> 02:53:26.502]  That's what he says.
[02:53:26.502 --> 02:53:39.501]  [Music]
[02:53:39.501 --> 02:53:42.502]  I bought this from a museum.
[02:53:42.451 --> 02:53:44.312]  It wasn't that expensive, a couple thousand dollars.
[02:53:45.032 --> 02:53:54.885]   But the paleontologist that curated it and mined this out of North Africa, estimate that this is 30 million years old.
[02:53:55.286 --> 02:53:58.429]  These are fish that lived their lives and floated down on the bottom and died.
[02:53:59.470 --> 02:54:09.980]  Now, whether they died 10,000 years ago or 30 million years ago, like the scientists say, regardless, they were living little creatures that had a life and went through the different paces.
[02:54:10.821 --> 02:54:11.682]  But what about humans?
[02:54:13.100 --> 02:54:15.643]  We can envision all this incredible art.
[02:54:16.204 --> 02:54:23.032]  A photo of my daughter, a painting I did, a painting my older daughter did, a painting my uncle did who's been long dead when he was eight years old.
[02:54:23.902 --> 02:54:25.403]  Another painting my older daughter did.
[02:54:25.423 --> 02:54:27.203]  A painting my young daughter did.
[02:54:27.723 --> 02:54:30.605]  All of this is precious because it's consciousness.
[02:54:31.005 --> 02:54:32.565]  And it's things we're interfacing with.
[02:54:32.685 --> 02:54:38.227]  And the globalists don't want us to have any consciousness except ideas they pour into our brains.
[02:54:38.608 --> 02:54:40.888]  That's what the surveillance and the censorship is all about.
[02:54:40.908 --> 02:54:46.751]  And they're doing everything they can now to silence us and shut us down because they know I'm a populist.
[02:54:47.111 --> 02:54:48.111]  They know I believe in you.
[02:54:48.411 --> 02:54:49.192]  I believe in myself.
[02:54:49.552 --> 02:54:50.352]  I believe in humanity.
[02:54:50.872 --> 02:54:54.340]   So that's why as we hurdle Into the year 2022.
[02:54:56.482 --> 02:54:58.944]  Hell, today is February 2nd, 2022.
[02:55:00.165 --> 02:55:01.926]  Two, two, two, two.
[02:55:03.007 --> 02:55:05.168]  How would you say it, Rob?
[02:55:05.749 --> 02:55:06.970]  Two, two, two, two, two.
[02:55:07.190 --> 02:55:08.811]  Yeah, two, two, two, two, two.
[02:55:09.151 --> 02:55:10.812]  Here we are together, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:11.333 --> 02:55:12.353]  And just look at this.
[02:55:12.373 --> 02:55:20.960]  You know, my grandmother, 50-something years ago, hell, my mom's 70-something, 60-something years ago, my mom was a little girl.
[02:55:21.460 --> 02:55:27.101]   She watched her mother Knit that little hedgehog together.
[02:55:27.121 --> 02:55:28.402]  And here's one of my great daughters.
[02:55:29.403 --> 02:55:31.385]  My middle daughter with my younger daughter.
[02:55:31.405 --> 02:55:32.747]  This is just so magic.
[02:55:32.787 --> 02:55:34.208]  This is what life's about.
[02:55:34.248 --> 02:55:37.511]  It's about this great experience that we have together.
[02:55:38.532 --> 02:55:43.377]  Here's a little painting I did years ago, probably 20 years ago now, of the Japanese wave.
[02:55:45.442 --> 02:55:48.881]   Here's a little art piece my four-year-old daughter did and here's something I did.
[02:55:48.881 --> 02:55:54.402]   The point is this is all what life's about is our experiences and our love together and these
[02:55:54.402 --> 02:55:59.281]   tyrants are trying to shut that down and we can't let them and we can't let them shut InfoWars down.
[02:55:59.281 --> 02:56:04.801]   And so now I tell the listeners and viewers we need your support more than ever and everything
[02:56:04.801 --> 02:56:08.402]  we promote everything we sell empowers you as well.
[02:56:08.559 --> 02:56:09.439]  It's a 360 win.
[02:56:10.060 --> 02:56:24.694]  So please word-of-mouth spread the word Please pray for us and please go to infomercial.com Right now and get the great supplements a great t-shirts great products to keep us on air because I don't want the globals to be successful I don't want them to shut us down.
[02:56:25.094 --> 02:56:28.057]  I don't want them to silence me or you or anybody else.
[02:56:29.018 --> 02:56:32.580]   I Know we're gonna win And InfoWars has come so far together.
[02:56:33.341 --> 02:56:35.684]  And I don't think our fight has ended.
[02:56:35.824 --> 02:56:40.830]  But if it does end, I understand I've had a big, successful role here.
[02:56:42.613 --> 02:56:46.538]  But regardless, whatever you do, I want you to keep on fighting and never stop and never surrender.
[02:56:46.798 --> 02:57:02.237]  God bless and good luck.
[02:57:02.286 --> 02:57:03.406]  It is the good halogen.
[02:57:03.626 --> 02:57:11.808]  The UN admits 2 billion plus people have cognitive disabilities on the face of the earth today.
[02:57:12.988 --> 02:57:18.230]  That's over 20% because they have had iodine deficiencies.
[02:57:19.170 --> 02:57:21.191]  Now we've got two different great iodine products.
[02:57:21.211 --> 02:57:21.971]  We've got X2.
[02:57:22.051 --> 02:57:22.611]  It's amazing.
[02:57:23.376 --> 02:57:25.717]  Pure Deep Earth Crystal Atomic Iodine.
[02:57:26.217 --> 02:57:27.457]  And it's been sold out for a while.
[02:57:27.898 --> 02:57:38.201]  We finally got X3 back in, that is the Deep Earth Crystal Iodine, and then two other types, because some studies show it helps with the absorption of the pure iodine.
[02:57:38.461 --> 02:57:39.422]  So it's apples and oranges.
[02:57:40.062 --> 02:57:41.162]  Both formulas are excellent.
[02:57:41.182 --> 02:57:44.684]  People constantly ask me, including on the street, what's better, X2 or X3?
[02:57:46.334 --> 02:57:46.994]  Apples and oranges.
[02:57:47.075 --> 02:57:51.757]  It's like, do you like iceberg lettuce or do you like spinach?
[02:57:51.798 --> 02:57:53.659]  I mean, it's two different things.
[02:57:53.839 --> 02:57:57.041]  Or it's like a tomato versus a potato.
[02:57:58.082 --> 02:58:00.663]  Bottom line, your body needs iodine.
[02:58:01.484 --> 02:58:05.746]  And the globalists are bombarding all of us with bad halogens.
[02:58:05.967 --> 02:58:08.048]  Fluoride, bromine, chloride.
[02:58:08.576 --> 02:58:14.576]   all of those systems that block fertility, block our electrochemical cells, block our immune system.
[02:58:14.576 --> 02:58:20.255]   So just on the immune system front, so many people have deficiencies in iodine.
[02:58:20.255 --> 02:58:26.896]   So X3 is back in stock for being sold out for four months at 50% off.
