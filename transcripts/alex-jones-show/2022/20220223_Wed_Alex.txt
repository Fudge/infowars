[00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:10.248]  So the organized collapse of the planet to consolidate power and control and depopulate and destroy any vestige of a free society or checks and balances is now upon us.
[00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:22.791]  And make no mistake, when you see people like Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab or Justin Trudeau, they are the Stalins, the Hitlers, the Mao of our age, and they do it through covert means.
[00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:30.374]  But they are criminals, and so it's not as covert as they'd like, because they love to brag and give battle orders to their minions.
[00:00:31.803 --> 00:00:32.964]  And now the public's waking up.
[00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:36.067]  So as bad as the news is, there is a Great Awakening happening.
[00:00:36.087 --> 00:00:37.028]  So we're in the fight.
[00:00:37.068 --> 00:00:38.169]  That's the way it's always been.
[00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.011]  Evil always runs out ahead.
[00:00:40.051 --> 00:00:42.093]  Looks like it's invincible till the good people wake up.
[00:00:42.713 --> 00:00:44.395]  Good people of every race, color, and creed.
[00:00:44.955 --> 00:00:51.041]  Globalist sanctions set to trigger next phase of the Great Reset.
[00:00:51.341 --> 00:00:58.341]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:58.341 --> 00:01:20.341]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:20.341 --> 00:01:26.341]  [Intro]
[00:01:26.807 --> 00:01:33.536]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:35.919]  You better believe you got one!
[00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:43.239]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:57.239]  [music]
[00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:59.239]  [explosion]
[00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:01.239]  [music]
[00:02:01.239 --> 00:02:03.239]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[00:02:02.385 --> 00:02:03.226]  Dude, he's such a kind man.
[00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.587]  He has been so cancelled.
[00:02:05.127 --> 00:02:08.570]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:12.594]  How much heat have you gotten for being friends with him and having him on the show?
[00:02:12.714 --> 00:02:14.135]  A lot, but I don't pay attention.
[00:02:14.396 --> 00:02:14.656]  Okay.
[00:02:15.236 --> 00:02:15.536]  Yeah.
[00:02:16.217 --> 00:02:18.079]  I just, I can justify it.
[00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.892]  I'll tell you, that fucking guy is right about a lot of shit.
[00:02:22.292 --> 00:02:25.595]  He's a wild entertainer and a brilliant man.
[00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:26.536]  Isn't he fantastic?
[00:02:26.576 --> 00:02:27.377]  And no one is perfect.
[00:02:27.657 --> 00:02:29.859]  I've known Alex for like more than 20 years.
[00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:30.900]  I've hung out with that guy.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.561]  We've been hammered together so many times.
[00:02:34.182 --> 00:02:35.964]  That is the most misunderstood guy on the planet.
[00:02:36.144 --> 00:02:39.547]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[00:02:39.647 --> 00:02:40.908]  Shout out to Alex Jones.
[00:02:40.948 --> 00:02:41.389]  We love you.
[00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:43.851]  Alex Jones is a journalist and member of the media.
[00:02:44.151 --> 00:02:44.631]  End of story.
[00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:50.797]  Recently, many of the biggest tech companies joined in a coordinated effort to censor content from broadcaster Alex Jones.
[00:02:50.897 --> 00:03:01.085]  There's a reason why the mainstream media calls a guy like him a bomb thrower or a conspiracy theorist, because they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out.
[00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:11.554]   Why are the most powerful companies in the world suddenly so threatened by an independent radio show host in Texas that they're willing to lose business In order to make him shut up.
[00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:12.955]  He runs a media organization.
[00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:19.580]  And so when the January 6th Committee subpoenas him, they are basically violating our First Amendment protections.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:29.887]  The Department of Justice says not only is it investigating what happened inside the Capitol, but the conspirators and instigators who may have started this whole thing.
[00:03:30.107 --> 00:03:34.771]  Now the committee's decided to shut down one of the most popular journalists on the right, Alex Jones.
[00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:35.971]  Yes, journalist.
[00:03:36.191 --> 00:03:38.872]  The House Committee investigating the deadly assault on the U.S.
[00:03:38.892 --> 00:03:44.153]  Capitol is subpoenaing Trump allies Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[00:03:44.193 --> 00:03:47.774]  The committee says he helped organize the rally ahead of the riots.
[00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:52.435]  Alex Jones isn't simply innocent of inciting crime on January 6th.
[00:03:52.835 --> 00:03:58.096]  Alex Jones actively worked to prevent crimes from taking place on January 6th.
[00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:00.076]  Let's start marching to the Capitol!
[00:04:00.076 --> 00:04:01.076]  [crowd cheering]
[00:04:01.076 --> 00:04:02.076]  Peacefully!
[00:04:02.076 --> 00:04:08.076]   Notice, like Don Jr. said, we're not burning buildings down or shooting cops.
[00:04:08.076 --> 00:04:10.076]  We're building America up!
[00:04:10.076 --> 00:04:14.076]  We're here to take our rightful country back peacefully!
[00:04:14.076 --> 00:04:17.076]   We're not running interference for Alex Jones, and we're not guessing about it.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:19.300]  We happen to know this for a fact.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.300]  We need to not have a confrontation with the police.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.300]  We're going to make that the story.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:33.300]   Alex Jones is a journalist the same as Brian Stelter and Jake Tapper and Don Lemon are.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.021]  Absolutely.
[00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:35.502]  I was about to say the same thing.
[00:04:35.522 --> 00:04:37.745]  Some people are going to be like, don't insult Alex that way.
[00:04:37.805 --> 00:04:39.947]  Well, yeah, yeah, Alex Jones never lied us into a war.
[00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:41.128]  Right, right, right.
[00:04:41.148 --> 00:04:41.508]  True.
[00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.891]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:50.615]  And if Jones sat down with Tony Fauci, he would ask him real questions, just as journalists are supposed to do.
[00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:52.237]  He wouldn't just slobber all over him.
[00:04:52.757 --> 00:04:54.578]  Epstein, he was way ahead with that.
[00:04:54.638 --> 00:04:56.880]  He told me about Epstein a decade ago.
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.181]  Alex detailed all of that.
[00:04:59.822 --> 00:05:01.863]  Alex Jones, Info Wars.
[00:05:02.263 --> 00:05:07.787]  The media has tarnished him with all sorts of name-calling, conspiracy theorists, bomb-thrower.
[00:05:08.247 --> 00:05:13.090]  The one thing that I know about this gentleman, Alex Jones, is that he loves this country.
[00:05:13.691 --> 00:05:15.072]  He is as smart as a whip.
[00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:22.997]  He absolutely believes in what he believes in and he also does his research and his homework.
[00:05:23.037 --> 00:05:25.499]  He's incredibly detailed in his research.
[00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:26.399]  He loves this country.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.480]  Alex Jones's views on COVID and ask yourself, who's saner?
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.640]  It's not even close.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:37.480]   He's incredibly detailed in his research. He loves this country. He is a patriot and
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.560]   he's somebody who we better listen to or others in this country better listen to.
[00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:44.910]  Is it a stretch to say that Tucker Carlson is the new Alex Jones?
[00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.591]  There are no vaccine passports!
[00:05:46.611 --> 00:05:47.251]  That's insane!
[00:05:47.271 --> 00:05:48.751]  That's Alex Jones stuff!
[00:05:49.372 --> 00:05:53.953]  And by the way, just so you know, as proof, if you want to get a job, you'll need your vaccine papers.
[00:05:54.073 --> 00:06:04.877]  It was about five minutes before showtime, and I'm sitting there looking at a computer screen.
[00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:23.822]  I'm trying to come up with a headline for today's show and things are so intense, things are so serious, that I haven't been able to come up with one that really hits on the magnitude of the current point we're at.
[00:06:23.982 --> 00:06:30.988]  But I saw a video this morning when I was perusing through Jack Posobiec's amazing Twitter feed.
[00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:49.567]  That somebody had tweeted at him of a car on a tiny mountain road turning itself around on a one-lane road and if they make one inch mistake they will fall more than 3,000 feet and die.
[00:06:52.088 --> 00:06:53.269]  Now that's human intelligence.
[00:06:53.289 --> 00:06:54.350]  That's human AI.
[00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.170]  That's how amazing we are.
[00:06:57.431 --> 00:07:10.511]   The confidence of somebody to do that with no curb, multi-thousand foot, Cliff, certain death, and doing it very calmly with precision because they're a local taxi driver and know how to do it.
[00:07:14.537 --> 00:07:18.483]  And living under that level of pressure makes you a better driver, not a worse driver.
[00:07:20.632 --> 00:07:26.035]  If you look at the statistics, people that live in mountain areas like that have less car wrecks than people that live down in the flatlands.
[00:07:26.395 --> 00:07:41.542]  Even though they're in much more dangerous areas, because it's like going on a Mars mission, even the best athlete will have about half of their lung and heart capacity after the six-month mission just to get to Mars.
[00:07:43.523 --> 00:07:46.705]  Much less once they get there, it has lower gravity than Earth.
[00:07:48.658 --> 00:07:49.399]  That's the same thing.
[00:07:49.499 --> 00:07:52.321]  By not living under the pressure of gravity, you become weak.
[00:07:53.261 --> 00:07:57.324]  And by not living in a mountain pass area, you become not as strong.
[00:07:57.885 --> 00:08:03.149]  And that which doesn't kill us only makes us stronger, is really what I'm trying to get at here.
[00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:11.755]  And that we have lived under so much liberty and so much freedom for so long, we take things for granted.
[00:08:11.815 --> 00:08:14.017]  And when I'm saying that, I'm saying that to myself as well.
[00:08:15.146 --> 00:08:18.148]  I don't have the work ethic of my dad's dad.
[00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:21.531]  I don't have the skills he had to do basically everything and anything.
[00:08:23.553 --> 00:08:34.861]  He didn't call the repair company to come out and fix the electricity or fix the well or butcher the hogs or the chickens or the cows.
[00:08:35.342 --> 00:08:35.662]  He did it.
[00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.125]  And he knew how to do everything else too.
[00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.213]  But the point is, is that we are falling apart.
[00:08:44.293 --> 00:08:45.054]  Myself included.
[00:08:46.836 --> 00:08:49.579]  And let's just be honest about that so we can try to turn this thing around.
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:57.627]  But the real metaphor for the car on the mountain pass, that radio listeners, we'll just add the live show feed today.
[00:08:57.647 --> 00:08:59.589]  So you can find the link.
[00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:02.392]  But for TV viewers, you can see it.
[00:09:02.433 --> 00:09:03.113]  It's pretty amazing.
[00:09:04.068 --> 00:09:14.416]  It's more than just an allegory of how stress and pressure and knowing you're under stress and pressure and not buckling the stress and pressure, but using it like weightlifting or jogging to become stronger.
[00:09:15.176 --> 00:09:23.162]  See, a victim would just give up and roll under the bed and never leave their house again and just die of sedentary lifestyle.
[00:09:24.477 --> 00:09:30.880]  But people that go into life with gusto and exercise with gusto, they end up being healthier and happier and wiser and living longer.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:31.900]  And I'm not perfect.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.340]  I'm overweight because I overwork.
[00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:35.521]  But I understand the process.
[00:09:38.422 --> 00:09:43.685]  I've been the guy that ran six miles every other day and lifted weights five days a week and can do 100 pull-ups.
[00:09:44.885 --> 00:09:46.125]  Or I can do like five now.
[00:09:48.026 --> 00:09:52.488]  But that's a larger gestalt of the huge news we've got here today.
[00:09:56.539 --> 00:10:23.837]  What I'm really getting at with the allegory of the car is this, and the headline I'm going to write during the break will have something to do with this, because I want everybody to just pause for a moment and meditate and think about the fact that if we don't turn around, we're going to go off the edge of a cliff soon.
[00:10:24.337 --> 00:10:36.458]   And turning around is As hard as it was for the taxi driver to turn around on that multi-thousand foot mountaintop where one inch mistake would have killed him.
[00:10:37.338 --> 00:10:37.698]  One inch.
[00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:38.639]  Dead.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.521]  And that's basically where we're at now.
[00:10:43.002 --> 00:10:44.283]  And so here's the big announcement.
[00:10:44.623 --> 00:10:45.884]  I'm just going to tell you this right now.
[00:10:46.644 --> 00:10:52.408]  I don't know why I worry about lawyers and CNN hit pieces and any of that.
[00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:58.658]  Because I intellectually know that we are about to be in devastation.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:01.581]  And I want you all to know that too.
[00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:08.087]  Everybody worried about bills or worried about, you know, is your wife cheating on you?
[00:11:08.267 --> 00:11:13.052]  Or worried about, does the neighbor have a nicer pool than you?
[00:11:14.093 --> 00:11:14.933]  All that kind of stuff.
[00:11:15.214 --> 00:11:17.416]  Or do you have the latest appliances?
[00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:27.411]  None of that matters at this point, because I'm going to explain something to you with mathematical equations.
[00:11:27.471 --> 00:11:30.573]  They're all right here, and it's very well known, but you understand.
[00:11:30.593 --> 00:11:48.526]  I know the average listener is really smart here, but for new viewers and listeners or leftists that tune in and think everything's real funny, you understand what the Great Reset's next phase going in means, and what the mathematical equations are that equal mass starvation, uprisings, war, and death.
[00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:54.273]  You understand that we are plowing into hell itself.
[00:11:54.313 --> 00:11:56.193]  So I'm just going to give you something very simple here.
[00:11:56.213 --> 00:11:57.954]  When we come back, I'm going to go over some of the numbers for you.
[00:11:59.434 --> 00:12:04.776]  You know that global economists look at fertilizer as an equation of energy.
[00:12:06.477 --> 00:12:15.260]  And pounds of protein, pounds of carbohydrate, pounds of fat that are produced.
[00:12:16.421 --> 00:12:36.654]  And so if China and Russia don't ship the world fertilizer that's distributed out by multinational corporations, Russia doesn't even have the distribution system, hundreds of millions will starve to death in the next 12 months.
[00:12:36.754 --> 00:12:37.614]  And that's a fact.
[00:12:37.634 --> 00:12:38.495]  That's not even debated.
[00:12:42.116 --> 00:12:49.418]  Joe Biden has cut off over a thousand gas, oil, and gasoline pipelines in the U.S.
[00:12:49.558 --> 00:12:51.018]  alone in the last 13 months.
[00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:59.561]  He shut down the Middle Eastern pipeline that was set to be done soon going into Europe.
[00:13:02.061 --> 00:13:04.822]  The Germans just shut down the Russian Nord Stream 2.
[00:13:09.031 --> 00:13:13.535]  The globalists are making moves and blocking basically all commerce into Russia.
[00:13:13.795 --> 00:13:25.204]  So Russia says, fine, we'll cut fertilizer distribution when they're the largest supplier in that region and the second largest supplier in the world.
[00:13:27.285 --> 00:13:28.186]  And I've got the numbers.
[00:13:28.206 --> 00:13:29.247]  They run from bad to worse.
[00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.629]  We're talking 100 million extra people will starve to death.
[00:13:33.304 --> 00:13:47.748]  And you get to see Raggedy Ann Socky up there giggling and snicker and it's all funny when she already lives in a city that's the richest in the world and it has the most homeless people and poor people except for Los Angeles.
[00:13:49.288 --> 00:14:06.999]   DC is a festering, satanic, forced vaccine passport hellhole and you've got these perching globalists living in the middle of this time bomb While they turn off the world's energy, and while the Energy Secretary, remember six months ago?
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.723]  When gas prices started to explode, they've now doubled, gasoline prices?
[00:14:11.563 --> 00:14:15.126]  She said, Oh, we're doing this on purpose.
[00:14:15.847 --> 00:14:17.428]  We're going into a transition.
[00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.172]  We're going into a reset.
[00:14:23.373 --> 00:14:25.295]  And we are lock step.
[00:14:26.314 --> 00:14:33.497]  She said the full interview with our partners around the world to stop global warming and climate change.
[00:14:33.757 --> 00:14:36.358]  And when you hear that, that means kill billions of people.
[00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:42.161]  So all the little cuties and liberals and purple hair people.
[00:14:43.072 --> 00:14:48.736]  That think they're cool and trendy because they wear, you know, little funny socks and pink sunglasses.
[00:14:48.976 --> 00:14:51.118]  Hey, I don't care if you have no hair or blue hair or what it is.
[00:14:51.318 --> 00:14:52.479]  I care about the content of your brain.
[00:14:52.779 --> 00:14:59.844]  But all you left is think you're part of some big winning fun team and you're going to have this progressive utopia you're building.
[00:15:00.084 --> 00:15:04.507]  No, you're building a hole in the ground that we're all going to be shoveled into, you dumbasses.
[00:15:07.329 --> 00:15:12.350]   So the next phase The Great Reset is beginning now.
[00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:13.310]  Famine.
[00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.990]  Collapse.
[00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:14.650]  War.
[00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:15.891]  Hyperinflation.
[00:15:17.591 --> 00:15:18.411]  Civil unrest.
[00:15:18.831 --> 00:15:19.612]  False flags.
[00:15:19.972 --> 00:15:20.712]  Mass arrests.
[00:15:21.512 --> 00:15:23.213]  The end of the world as you know it.
[00:15:23.553 --> 00:15:31.515]  The young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of this government, are actually young nobodies of the world economy.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.081]  We penetrate the cabinets.
[00:15:34.661 --> 00:15:37.802]  The change is not just happening.
[00:15:37.822 --> 00:15:41.584]  The change can be shaped by us.
[00:15:42.344 --> 00:15:44.786]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[00:15:45.206 --> 00:15:46.146]  How to prepare?
[00:15:46.546 --> 00:15:49.508]  Take the necessary action to create a fairer world.
[00:15:51.189 --> 00:15:52.869]  I see the need for a great reset.
[00:15:53.590 --> 00:16:00.853]  The people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had and everything will be normal again.
[00:16:01.274 --> 00:16:03.775]  This is, let's say, fiction.
[00:16:03.855 --> 00:16:05.236]  It will not happen.
[00:16:05.736 --> 00:16:09.238]  There is only one way this pandemic is going to go.
[00:16:10.078 --> 00:16:13.139]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:18.580]  The next crisis is already waiting for us around the corner.
[00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:25.979]  and it is a climate crisis.
[00:16:25.979 --> 00:16:34.158]   Alright, here's the best way I can lay this out for you and...
[00:16:34.184 --> 00:16:36.284]  And again, I don't like to bring people really bad news.
[00:16:37.225 --> 00:16:38.645]  And I think listeners have now figured it out.
[00:16:40.517 --> 00:16:47.878]  Even new listeners can go back and see things I said 10 years ago, 25 years ago, 28 years ago, and see that it's about 98% accurate.
[00:16:49.099 --> 00:16:50.799]  I don't tell you this to scare you.
[00:16:51.099 --> 00:16:52.659]  This is not fear porn, it's the opposite.
[00:16:53.619 --> 00:16:54.279]  It's reality.
[00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.420]  And it's preparation.
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.461]  Already, things can't be turned around.
[00:17:03.421 --> 00:17:08.622]  And we should talk about where we are now, even if we tried to fix things, at this point, what is about to unfold?
[00:17:11.468 --> 00:17:14.229]  But instead, they're going to accelerate it and make it as bad as they can.
[00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:20.831]  And so I personally have very serious nightmares now.
[00:17:21.491 --> 00:17:23.792]  And I'm not the type of person that has nightmares.
[00:17:23.832 --> 00:17:26.933]  I mean, I have nightmares about what's happening and about how to fix it.
[00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:30.754]  And lifelike dreams where I'm working and reading and researching.
[00:17:30.794 --> 00:17:35.895]  And that only happens when people are under the highest levels of do or die situations.
[00:17:36.916 --> 00:17:41.037]  And so I just want you to know, in my 28 years on air, I've never been this concerned.
[00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:51.570]  I say that because I think everybody that's in their comfort zone, including myself and everybody else out there, needs to get out of our comfort zones and needs to get ready.
[00:17:53.152 --> 00:17:54.534]  Let me explain it this way.
[00:17:54.554 --> 00:18:08.819]   I think people that are out there that are farmers or people that are engineers or people that are economists or people that are in business or transport, People understand what it takes to produce things and do things and how delicate this industrialized world is.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:13.905]  It's hard to run a civilization when you've got good, smart, hardworking people.
[00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:15.747]  This wasn't easy to build.
[00:18:18.911 --> 00:18:45.668]   And if you deliberately start attacking major sectors of it, While you consolidate money and power and take over the world to collapse it so you can bring in an authoritarian, casual society with calorie rations and tracker systems and social credit scores controlling every facet of your life, if you want to live under that, you are a sadomasochist.
[00:18:47.108 --> 00:18:48.429]  So let me just say it very, very calmly.
[00:18:51.112 --> 00:18:59.918]  The controlled, organized demolition of the world economy to create a post-industrial world for 90-plus percent of the world population is underway.
[00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:24.757]   The globalist institutions organizing this, BlackRock, the Carnegie Endowment that runs the CIA, the Ford Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Group, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Combines, the Sachs-Coburg-Goffa family, and others, They have decided to just destroy civilization.
[00:19:29.499 --> 00:19:37.141]  And what they're now implementing, irrevocably, is economic cultural war.
[00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:53.464]   And by strategically cutting off the energy supplies and strategically cutting off the fertilizer, which Karl Schwab called for a decade ago, and so did Henry Kissinger in 1970, Three, instead of apartment memorandum 200.
[00:19:54.324 --> 00:19:55.085]  That's public, by the way.
[00:19:55.105 --> 00:19:55.745]  Go read it, folks.
[00:19:58.327 --> 00:20:00.648]  That they were looking at things like this.
[00:20:01.189 --> 00:20:02.169]  And here's the deal.
[00:20:02.309 --> 00:20:03.750]  They're doing it now.
[00:20:05.712 --> 00:20:16.819]  And so if I flew to Africa and pulled out a machete and walked in an African village and killed 10 African children, I'd be called the biggest racist mass murderer on earth.
[00:20:18.035 --> 00:20:27.660]  But if I cut their energy and food off and starve 50 million of them to death in the next year, conservatively in Africa, for half the deaths scheduled to happen, then it would be trendy and liberal.
[00:20:28.681 --> 00:20:37.785]  And then we get to be lectured by all these leftists that work for this vicious, scientific, global dictatorship, and they'll tell you, well, there aren't too many people.
[00:20:38.045 --> 00:20:43.908]  So it's this weird double think where they're fighting Nazis and they would make Hitler blush.
[00:20:44.569 --> 00:20:46.850]  And they work for people that would make Hitler blush.
[00:20:48.411 --> 00:20:53.172]  They work for people whose grandfathers literally trained the Nazis.
[00:20:55.833 --> 00:21:00.133]  It just so happens most of these Great Reset people are the grandchildren of top Nazis.
[00:21:01.954 --> 00:21:02.694]  Or worked for them.
[00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:10.336]  And it's not that it's a Nazi conspiracy, it's that these families are in on everything bad.
[00:21:11.736 --> 00:21:15.877]  They can be German, they can be Chinese, they can be Jewish, they don't give a damn.
[00:21:15.917 --> 00:21:17.317]  They're gonna be in on the evil.
[00:21:19.449 --> 00:21:25.560]  Every person we're putting on screen openly worked for the Nazis or their family literally trained the Nazis.
[00:21:28.425 --> 00:21:29.888]  Can't make it up.
[00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:39.314]  And they have horrible ill will towards you and your family, and they're coming at you through their administrative systems of the technocracy.
[00:21:39.595 --> 00:21:40.915]  We're in a technocracy.
[00:21:41.115 --> 00:21:53.403]  So they can hit a button, pull a switch, give an order, and tens of millions starve to death, wars start, energy prices explode, savings are annihilated, currencies are devalued, inflation spirals out of control.
[00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:02.192]  And all over the West, Bill Gates says, I don't want people to have access to fertilizer anymore.
[00:22:04.032 --> 00:22:05.253]  And you're not going to get meat anymore.
[00:22:06.013 --> 00:22:07.113]  People say, well, how are they going to do that?
[00:22:07.193 --> 00:22:08.574]  Well, we've got the Energy Secretary.
[00:22:08.594 --> 00:22:09.214]  You guys have the clip.
[00:22:09.274 --> 00:22:10.114]  I don't know if you found it.
[00:22:10.614 --> 00:22:16.296]  Six months ago, say, oh, this is part of a, this is part of a transition.
[00:22:16.376 --> 00:22:18.297]  Yeah, we could lower your gas prices, but we're not.
[00:22:18.557 --> 00:22:22.538]  We're going to make you transition to electric cars that use just as much carbon.
[00:22:23.378 --> 00:22:24.719]  What do you think the power plants are burning?
[00:22:24.999 --> 00:22:25.559]  It's all bull.
[00:22:26.872 --> 00:22:27.912]  Yeah, let's play the clip of her.
[00:22:28.132 --> 00:22:38.295]  Another little cute World Economic Forum face, the Secretary of Energy, just telling you, yeah, we could do that, but we're not gonna let you have cheaper energy.
[00:22:38.335 --> 00:22:38.755]  Here it is.
[00:22:39.615 --> 00:22:55.263]   But the bottom line is that this president and this administration are looking at every single tool to shield American families from the impact of rising energy prices, and we're working through We're working through an energy transition.
[00:22:56.084 --> 00:22:58.344]  And we've got to start by adding energy.
[00:22:59.124 --> 00:23:04.006]  And the reality is we have to take some time to get off of oil and gas.
[00:23:04.026 --> 00:23:04.886]  We recognize this.
[00:23:04.906 --> 00:23:06.266]  This is a transition.
[00:23:07.786 --> 00:23:13.908]  She goes on, you can pull up the articles and videos to say, yes, we can lower your gas prices, but we're in this transition.
[00:23:14.708 --> 00:23:15.128]  There it is.
[00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:17.969]  So.
[00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:21.190]  That's war.
[00:23:22.636 --> 00:23:40.152]  When somebody artificially doubles or triples your fuel prices or increases fertilizer prices by 200-300%, you will pay more for food now, you will go broke, you might even get homeless, but in the third world, you die.
[00:23:43.915 --> 00:23:44.436]  You die.
[00:23:48.570 --> 00:23:58.978]  And they're doing everything they can to cut potash production, and to cut fertilizer production, and to cut fuel production, and it's causing mass death, and that's the next level of the Great Reset.
[00:23:59.899 --> 00:24:10.528]  And now these sanctions on Russia are triggering their sanctions back in a cascading event, and then Joe Biden comes out and says, the whole media says, Russia's to blame for all the inflation.
[00:24:10.768 --> 00:24:12.169]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:12.229 --> 00:24:14.331]  You are in the reality zone.
[00:24:17.091 --> 00:24:27.074]  So the organized collapse of the planet to consolidate power and control and depopulate and destroy any vestige of a free society or checks and balances is now upon us.
[00:24:28.613 --> 00:24:39.620]  And make no mistake, when you see people like Bill Gates or Klaus Schwab or Justin Trudeau, they are the Stalins, the Hitlers, the Mal of our age, and they do it through covert means.
[00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:47.205]  But they are criminals, and so it's not as covert as they'd like, because they love to brag and give battle orders to their minions.
[00:24:48.629 --> 00:24:49.790]  And now the public's waking up.
[00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.892]  So as bad as the news is, there is a Great Awakening happening.
[00:24:52.912 --> 00:24:53.832]  So we're in the fight.
[00:24:53.872 --> 00:24:54.993]  That's the way it's always been.
[00:24:55.613 --> 00:24:56.834]  Evil always runs out ahead.
[00:24:56.874 --> 00:24:58.915]  Looks like it's invincible till the good people wake up.
[00:24:59.535 --> 00:25:01.216]  Good people of every race, color, and creed.
[00:25:01.777 --> 00:25:10.902]  Globalist sanctions set to trigger next phase of the Great Reset.
[00:25:12.683 --> 00:25:16.005]  Planetary collapse of energy and food production systems.
[00:25:16.265 --> 00:25:17.106]  Watch live.
[00:25:19.636 --> 00:25:26.882]  Today's broadcast is absolutely essential.
[00:25:29.084 --> 00:25:34.803]   And everything we do is about giving you the power, empowering you with reminding you that
[00:25:34.803 --> 00:25:38.403]   God is eternal and that these globalists are transitory and will pay for what they've done
[00:25:38.403 --> 00:25:42.964]   and to remind you that you are part of a larger destiny, part of a wider, beautiful universe
[00:25:42.964 --> 00:25:47.423]   that God created and that your eyes have not seen, your ears have not heard, your mind
[00:25:47.423 --> 00:25:52.143]  has not imagined what God has in store for all of us.
[00:25:52.143 --> 00:25:56.303]   And that we need to recognize the evil but then transcend it and build a new, better
[00:25:56.303 --> 00:25:59.224]  future together.
[00:25:59.224 --> 00:26:04.224]   Now I can hit these clips and I can go over the absurdity of it all but suddenly on a
[00:26:04.224 --> 00:26:09.064]   dime they go from a year ago saying there is no inflation to saying inflation is only
[00:26:09.064 --> 00:26:16.702]   brief and light to okay there's inflation, it's good for you so you use less things.
[00:26:17.224 --> 00:26:19.806]  And now they say it's all the Russians' fault.
[00:26:21.687 --> 00:26:25.329]  And finally, when you're lying this much, occasionally it becomes partially true.
[00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:35.996]  Yeah, the Russians just announced massive sanctions on raw material that they are in the top two or three, in some cases number one, suppliers of on the planet.
[00:26:37.377 --> 00:26:39.558]  Fertilizer, potash, everything.
[00:26:42.617 --> 00:26:45.038]  And so, that is going to do what?
[00:26:46.299 --> 00:26:49.080]  Kill competition, which the globalists want.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:51.321]  That's why they're shutting down all the different pipelines.
[00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:52.922]  The Israeli pipeline.
[00:26:53.382 --> 00:26:54.742]  The Saudi Arabian pipeline.
[00:26:55.103 --> 00:26:55.643]  The U.S.
[00:26:55.683 --> 00:26:56.223]  pipeline.
[00:26:56.623 --> 00:26:57.664]  The Russian pipeline.
[00:26:57.944 --> 00:26:58.924]  Who's that hurt?
[00:27:01.145 --> 00:27:02.946]  And see, the Russians have gone into the trap.
[00:27:03.266 --> 00:27:06.568]  And I get it, if Putin doesn't do that, the hardliners will remove him.
[00:27:08.128 --> 00:27:19.498]   But, if he doesn't sell fertilizer to the West, And if that jacks up prices and then it doesn't get shipped to the third world where they need it to produce food for us and for themselves, that's going to cause mass death.
[00:27:20.199 --> 00:27:21.539]  Well, what else can Russia do?
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.863]  Well, be more Christ-like and just keep selling the raw material.
[00:27:26.883 --> 00:27:47.706]   Because the Russians are willing to hurt themselves to stand up and fight back, but when you pull back and realize it's the globalists and it's Klaus Schwab and it's the big banks and corporations that are bragging and doing this, Russia responding like this In my view, it's not good, because that's the Klaus Schwab plan, the angrier world.
[00:27:48.647 --> 00:28:00.916]  They've scripted all this out, that first they lock the world down, then they collapse the third world, then the UN organizes the refugee flows to be brought into the West, then big corporations are paid by governments to house the, quote, refugees.
[00:28:00.996 --> 00:28:03.018]  Airbnb just announced a huge plan.
[00:28:03.858 --> 00:28:04.619]  That's all paid for.
[00:28:04.639 --> 00:28:06.720]  The media spends it like, oh, aren't they sweet?
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.562]  No, it's an organized political takeover.
[00:28:10.091 --> 00:28:13.472]  So, the first world, the third world, everything's under attack.
[00:28:13.932 --> 00:28:15.193]  The middle class is under attack.
[00:28:15.293 --> 00:28:16.313]  Poor people are under attack.
[00:28:16.634 --> 00:28:17.874]  It isn't the 2% or the 1%.
[00:28:18.994 --> 00:28:24.677]  We've done the math, and it varies on how you do the numbers, but if you count people that make $250,000 or above, it's the 1%.
[00:28:24.517 --> 00:28:32.657]  $150,000 or above, it's the 1%.
[00:28:32.657 --> 00:28:40.376]   But it is not even one-tenth of 1% of that 1% that has 80% of the wealth.
[00:28:40.716 --> 00:28:42.636]  They only had 60% two years ago.
[00:28:42.916 --> 00:28:50.619]  They got 80% roughly now, and they're about to have it all, and then they believe they own it through fraud, and they don't want you on their property.
[00:28:53.821 --> 00:28:54.521]  They want you dead.
[00:28:55.347 --> 00:29:04.255]  So if you're going to let them depopulate you and slowly poison you with GMO and shots and, you know, just watch TV and Netflix while you live in a 200 square foot coffin apartment.
[00:29:05.636 --> 00:29:10.241]  If you're an adult and you're lazy and you're caught up in this and you think it's fun, then just do it.
[00:29:10.261 --> 00:29:14.625]  In fact, save us all time and energy and just blow your brains out.
[00:29:14.945 --> 00:29:15.385]  Seriously.
[00:29:16.266 --> 00:29:18.108]  But do not do this to the children.
[00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:20.571]  Do not lead them into the darkness.
[00:29:21.231 --> 00:29:29.616]  Do not go along as parents with this and sign them onto this technocracy or you will be destroyed spiritually.
[00:29:32.758 --> 00:29:34.299]  Don't let the darkness take them.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.202]  Don't make them feel forsaken.
[00:29:39.042 --> 00:29:41.203]  Just lead them safely to the light.
[00:29:41.984 --> 00:29:48.788]  When this whole world is blown asunder, remember, someone really loves you.
[00:29:50.418 --> 00:29:51.238]  We're gonna live forever.
[00:29:52.319 --> 00:29:53.279]  We're gonna cross that river.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:56.961]  We're gonna reach tomorrow now.
[00:29:58.161 --> 00:30:00.122]  And I'm paraphrasing that song.
[00:30:00.843 --> 00:30:03.104]  You guys give me the lyrics to that Highwaymen song?
[00:30:03.804 --> 00:30:05.725]  Because that's really what this is all about.
[00:30:06.025 --> 00:30:07.706]  We're all about to get tested really bad.
[00:30:08.046 --> 00:30:13.768]  They're already killing 40 extra million people the UN admits, and I believe the numbers, have starved to death from their lockdown.
[00:30:14.029 --> 00:30:15.169]  They never point out they did it.
[00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:17.990]  They go, give us money, give us money, we gotta save these people.
[00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:19.271]  Of course, they give them nothing.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:21.980]  I mean, the U.N.
[00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:29.303]  on record goes into Africa particularly and just lines up thousands of people on a routine basis that are on their tribal lands that they won't give up.
[00:30:29.504 --> 00:30:32.165]  And they just shoot men, women, and children, just blow their brains out.
[00:30:33.225 --> 00:30:37.847]  And the peacekeepers will rape the children, rape the babies, and then just blow their brains out.
[00:30:37.947 --> 00:30:40.108]  I mean, there's videos, photos, hours of it.
[00:30:40.388 --> 00:30:42.069]  I never even show you this stuff, folks.
[00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:46.231]  I never show you what the... I mean, you can go find it if you want to see this stuff.
[00:30:47.291 --> 00:30:48.872]  It's stuff so unspeakable.
[00:30:50.074 --> 00:31:07.922]  Where they're roasting humans and eating them, the UN, and Al-Qaeda does it too, ISIS, and they've got these roasted people, and they're getting slices off of it like it's ham, and they're eating hearts, I mean it's just, it's unbelievable, okay?
[00:31:08.422 --> 00:31:19.567]  And then they tell you America's bad, America's evil, where we are the freest, fairest, most open country in the world, with the left destroying it at every level.
[00:31:21.355 --> 00:31:25.076]   I'm just going to say this right now, and I almost came in here today and just talked
[00:31:25.076 --> 00:31:29.795]   about InfoWars, because if you can look through the prism of InfoWars, you can basically see
[00:31:29.795 --> 00:31:32.256]  everything else just on a larger scale.
[00:31:32.256 --> 00:31:36.096]   But what we experience, what we go through, what we have dealt with has given us a lot
[00:31:36.096 --> 00:31:44.516]   of frontline experience with the enemy and given us observations and life lessons that
[00:31:44.516 --> 00:31:46.035]  really not a lot of other people have had.
[00:31:46.594 --> 00:31:52.538]  And I can see God's, you know, put us through this training, and I'm actually very blessed for all of this persecution.
[00:31:52.558 --> 00:31:54.640]  I don't say that just to act like I'm blessed.
[00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:57.422]  I am extremely thankful for everything God's done to me.
[00:31:57.522 --> 00:32:05.909]  It's all been shaping me and preparing me like a sword in the forge, or a club, or a hammer.
[00:32:09.591 --> 00:32:13.972]  When my usefulness is up, God will take me out of this realm.
[00:32:14.112 --> 00:32:20.113]  But I just want to tell you, we've done the numbers, we've looked at the actuaries, we know about inflation.
[00:32:20.794 --> 00:32:34.697]  We know that in sectors that are dealing with the elites, where they have already engaged in massive spending, that elite goods are doubling yearly their cost.
[00:32:36.431 --> 00:32:39.394]  And that means that that inflation will soon be fully passed on.
[00:32:39.414 --> 00:32:41.936]  It usually takes a year or two to meet up to where they're at.
[00:32:42.356 --> 00:32:53.245]  But inflation is at 100% right now in all the different systems the globalists are involved in.
[00:32:54.946 --> 00:32:56.988]  So that's another really big serious note for everybody.
[00:33:00.385 --> 00:33:06.790]  I mean, they are assaulting every damn one of us viciously with hate to bankrupt us, to make us poor so they can control us and then kill us.
[00:33:07.231 --> 00:33:10.073]  They are coming to kill every one of us.
[00:33:11.014 --> 00:33:12.315]  And it's already begun.
[00:33:12.615 --> 00:33:13.696]  They've already lit the fuse.
[00:33:14.197 --> 00:33:17.860]  And only realizing it now and having a huge awakening can put the brakes on it.
[00:33:18.519 --> 00:33:20.300]  Alright folks, let's get right down to brass tacks.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:23.102]  They got the big convoy in California starting out right now.
[00:33:23.902 --> 00:33:25.803]  We're showing some live feeds of that for TV viewers.
[00:33:25.823 --> 00:33:29.085]  We'll also link up the live show feed of the broadcast today.
[00:33:29.105 --> 00:33:32.026]  A link to those folks and their site and what they're doing.
[00:33:32.267 --> 00:33:33.647]  Will they save the world by themselves?
[00:33:33.667 --> 00:33:33.707]  No.
[00:33:33.767 --> 00:33:38.090]  Could the enemy false flag them and somehow turn it against us?
[00:33:38.130 --> 00:33:38.410]  Yes.
[00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.851]  But inaction is death.
[00:33:41.732 --> 00:33:42.832]  Resistance is victory.
[00:33:43.813 --> 00:33:56.204]   And it's going to be through the process That we'll win some battles, we'll lose some battles, but in the end, by engaging and going out and facing down the system, we will become stronger, they will become weaker, we will win.
[00:33:56.684 --> 00:34:02.847]  It is in the catatonic state we've been in, of sleep, of spiritual sleep, that we are being fed on by these vampires.
[00:34:04.608 --> 00:34:06.469]  Alright, here's the deal.
[00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:09.930]  I've got so much really interesting, incredible news.
[00:34:11.171 --> 00:34:14.052]  And if we don't cover every facet of each piece, it really doesn't help people.
[00:34:15.117 --> 00:34:17.139]  It's not just good enough to report interesting news.
[00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:18.800]  People need to know the story behind the story.
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:23.744]  But from my perspective, here's the type of stuff in the stack today, okay?
[00:34:28.147 --> 00:34:36.614]  Russia to close the northern sea route in the Arctic with electric dome weather control harp system.
[00:34:38.274 --> 00:34:39.754]  Now, that's mainstream news.
[00:34:39.914 --> 00:34:50.937]  And yes, the Russians have a weather weapon, just like we do, it's the same damn thing, that can cause giant arctic blizzards, and that can send blizzards into as far south as Mexico if they wanted to.
[00:34:53.478 --> 00:34:54.818]  And see, that's my frustration.
[00:34:54.898 --> 00:34:57.479]  If somebody could just understand this, they'd understand everything.
[00:35:00.905 --> 00:35:01.925]  We are in the year 2022.
[00:35:03.086 --> 00:35:07.167]  All these major governments have incredibly powerful weather weapons.
[00:35:07.627 --> 00:35:08.388]  China has them.
[00:35:08.688 --> 00:35:09.908]  The European Union has them.
[00:35:10.168 --> 00:35:11.329]  The UK has them.
[00:35:13.149 --> 00:35:14.270]  The United States has them.
[00:35:14.790 --> 00:35:15.710]  Canada has them.
[00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:23.293]  And when we try to talk about this stuff, the media goes, oh no, that doesn't exist.
[00:35:23.313 --> 00:35:34.858]   Kind of like, hey, The public school, elementary school girl summer camps have biological mints in the rooms with the girls and showering with them.
[00:35:37.158 --> 00:35:38.039]  You didn't tell us that.
[00:35:38.479 --> 00:35:39.219]  It's the same thing.
[00:35:40.319 --> 00:35:41.599]  All this stuff's going on.
[00:35:41.799 --> 00:35:49.461]  I mean, they are injecting billions of people with a gene therapy that turns off your white blood cells and makes you more susceptible to COVID on record.
[00:35:50.581 --> 00:35:54.282]  I mean, I've got a stack of news on that that I should have made a bigger deal about.
[00:35:57.698 --> 00:35:59.120]  I was out with Joe Rogan again last night.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:05.768]  He's really awake and on fire and we hung out quite a bit and he was just saying, have you seen where the...
[00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:14.713]  CDC says they're not going to release COVID data and hospital numbers anymore because it's being used for vaccine hesitancy and so is foreign governments.
[00:36:14.753 --> 00:36:16.974]  And I said, yeah, I should cover that more.
[00:36:16.994 --> 00:36:31.481]  I mean, I mean, we mentioned it the last few days, but that alone is such a massive, massive, massive thing because the numbers are real and it shows a 40 plus percent increase in death, 18 to 65 working age people.
[00:36:32.841 --> 00:36:33.862]  It's the biggest ever recorded.
[00:36:34.491 --> 00:36:37.372]  We didn't lose this many during the Spanish Flu or World War I or World War II.
[00:36:40.653 --> 00:36:41.713]  Unbelievable.
[00:36:41.993 --> 00:36:42.754]  And then they spun it.
[00:36:42.994 --> 00:36:48.976]  Oh, we suppressed it because the numbers made it look like the booster shots or the shots didn't help you.
[00:36:49.096 --> 00:36:50.456]  No, that's not why they're suppressing it.
[00:36:50.476 --> 00:36:52.517]  It's because it shows massive death numbers.
[00:36:52.937 --> 00:36:58.238]  The spin by Brit Hume and Fox News is, oh, because it showed the vaccine didn't work.
[00:36:59.699 --> 00:37:02.880]  I mean, you think they just opened up on us with these deadly shots?
[00:37:06.118 --> 00:37:12.282]  And to confuse people, send out batches to leftist areas that were barely contaminated and to right-wing areas completely.
[00:37:12.462 --> 00:37:13.383]  That's called war.
[00:37:15.304 --> 00:37:17.806]  You think they just launched that and they're going to stop now?
[00:37:18.086 --> 00:37:18.266]  No.
[00:37:18.526 --> 00:37:29.276]   They're jacking with the power supplies, turning development, extraction, delivery, And taxes on top of it is increasing.
[00:37:29.516 --> 00:37:34.597]  At every level of the energy chain, that's real currency, that's real money, that's power.
[00:37:34.958 --> 00:37:37.879]  Energy is the power we operate on, how we live.
[00:37:39.859 --> 00:37:42.880]  You double somebody's gas prices, you just took food off their table.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:44.721]  You just took medicine they need.
[00:37:44.961 --> 00:37:49.483]  You just took things from them, vitamins, entertainment, life, whatever.
[00:37:51.483 --> 00:37:53.264]  And in the third world, you just killed a bunch of people.
[00:37:55.626 --> 00:38:08.111]  And we get lectured by these murderers when they know good and damn well what they're doing, and now they start blocking the export of almost everything out of Russia except fertilizer.
[00:38:08.131 --> 00:38:15.674]  But the globalists know that Russia will then, they've got all their systems surveilled, will then cut the fertilizer off, and that's exactly what Klaus Schwab wants.
[00:38:15.994 --> 00:38:23.537]  And then when hundreds of millions of people starve to death in the next few years, which is estimated, it's all Vladimir Putin's fault.
[00:38:25.182 --> 00:38:29.685]  Putin says he's a Christian now, and I think Putin should turn the other cheek.
[00:38:29.725 --> 00:38:30.666]  I think the Russians should.
[00:38:30.686 --> 00:38:37.351]  I think it's fine they took over those Russian-held areas that have always been part of Russia because they were being attacked by the globalists.
[00:38:37.391 --> 00:38:40.674]  And I get Ukraine's a puppet state, and Putin says if they're going to take it, I'm going to take it.
[00:38:41.695 --> 00:38:43.856]  And Trump calls it brilliant and all the rest of this.
[00:38:44.317 --> 00:38:48.320]  Well, what would be brilliant, Putin, is not putting sanctions on the West.
[00:38:49.434 --> 00:38:51.055]  Because the West is not doing this.
[00:38:51.175 --> 00:38:52.096]  Our evil elites are.
[00:38:54.238 --> 00:38:59.241]  And our people are so brain damaged and so dumbed down, on average, they're really going to believe the Russians did this to us.
[00:39:00.442 --> 00:39:05.746]  And I understand the Russians are the ones under sanctions for decades and attacking all the rest of it, and I really want Russia to succeed.
[00:39:06.167 --> 00:39:10.490]  I'm just saying I don't agree with them responding back with sanctions.
[00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:16.855]  Because the globalists are going to make even more money now on the products they sell while starving and hurting us.
[00:39:17.859 --> 00:39:19.519]  And killing people in the third world.
[00:39:19.539 --> 00:39:25.040]  So I tell Putin to do the right thing and be Christ-like and be a real hero and a real champion.
[00:39:26.721 --> 00:39:28.761]  And maybe have a snap election vote.
[00:39:29.721 --> 00:39:36.663]  A referendum to the Russian people of what sanctions do you want and let the Russian people decide if they want to cut the fertilizer off.
[00:39:36.683 --> 00:39:39.003]  Because listen, I'll be able to get enough food for my family.
[00:39:41.284 --> 00:39:43.124]  But a lot of people around the world are going to starve to death.
[00:39:44.491 --> 00:39:46.912]  And I understand Russia's like, okay, you're going to shut all our stuff off?
[00:39:47.132 --> 00:39:48.072]  We'll shut it off to you.
[00:39:48.633 --> 00:39:52.534]  This is... Christ was not the pacifist, people say.
[00:39:52.574 --> 00:39:56.936]  Christ was teaching people lessons of when to hold them, when to fold them, when to walk away, when to run.
[00:39:58.696 --> 00:40:03.858]  And the Pharisees were trying to trick him into a fight with him so they could kill him there.
[00:40:04.238 --> 00:40:08.060]  He hadn't finished his mission yet, so he turned the other cheek.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.981]  Not because he was a wimp, but because he was strong.
[00:40:11.961 --> 00:40:13.542]  You just slap me upside the head?
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.481]  Go ahead and slap the other side.
[00:40:16.521 --> 00:40:17.201]  You're the fool.
[00:40:17.461 --> 00:40:20.683]  You're the one that can't argue with me, that's punching me in the face.
[00:40:23.725 --> 00:40:25.086]  That's what Christ would do.
[00:40:25.947 --> 00:40:26.367]  Now I get it.
[00:40:26.387 --> 00:40:27.508]  The military is attacking you.
[00:40:27.528 --> 00:40:28.008]  They're rolling in.
[00:40:28.028 --> 00:40:28.528]  They're killing people.
[00:40:28.548 --> 00:40:29.089]  You've got to fight.
[00:40:29.609 --> 00:40:30.509]  That's biblical as well.
[00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:40.510]   I'm saying there's times when Klaus Schwab, the New World Order, think they're smarter than everybody to not I think it's a very measured, reasonable thing that's been done.
[00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:44.330]   and push and push and Putin cut his defense spending and Putin, you know, did all that
[00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:48.089]   stuff and he tried to not have this happen and I get that NATO's taking over so he's
[00:40:48.089 --> 00:40:51.490]   got to show he's not going to put up with it and begin to escalate.
[00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:58.770]   I mean, I think it's a very measured, reasonable thing that's been done.
[00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:01.709]   But the sanctions are going to hurt Russians too because they're not going to sell these
[00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:05.650]  valuable commodities that everybody needs.
[00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:10.930]   So just as I didn't want our Keystone Pipeline shut down right when it was finished, that
[00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:15.970]   would lower energy prices as much as 30% for the average American.
[00:41:15.945 --> 00:41:20.206]  I do not want the Nord Stream 2 shutdown that will help Europeans and Russians together.
[00:41:20.467 --> 00:41:21.027]  Commerce!
[00:41:21.867 --> 00:41:39.793]  I want beautiful hypersonic jets flying back and forth in beautiful cities and terraforming deserts and space colonies and all of this instead of globalists having us fight over resources by making the resources more scarce because they like to keep us down and control us.
[00:41:40.093 --> 00:41:42.494]  We have basically unlimited resources, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:45.043 --> 00:41:46.644]  I'm going to go to break and come back in the next hour.
[00:41:46.664 --> 00:41:48.506]  We've got a special guest in the studio and so much more.

[00:42:15.102 --> 00:42:25.961]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[00:42:25.961 --> 00:42:32.602]   And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting people
[00:42:32.602 --> 00:42:36.721]  taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:40.739]   And if you're not getting sunshine, shine every single day, whether you're black or white or
[00:42:40.739 --> 00:42:42.420]  Hispanic, it doesn't matter.

[00:42:50.179 --> 00:42:54.259]   You die in five or six days without water, you die in a month without food.
[00:42:54.259 --> 00:42:59.300]   Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:00.378]  you need.
[00:43:00.378 --> 00:43:03.898]   And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is vitamin

[00:43:22.659 --> 00:43:22.659]  [music]
[00:43:23.659 --> 00:43:24.659]  [music]
[00:43:25.659 --> 00:43:26.659]  [music]
[00:43:27.659 --> 00:43:28.659]  [music]
[00:43:28.659 --> 00:43:29.659]  [music]
[00:43:29.659 --> 00:43:30.659]  [music]
[00:43:30.659 --> 00:43:30.659]  [music]
[00:43:30.659 --> 00:43:32.820]  (thunder)
[00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:41.162]   *sniff* After bombshell news broke over the weekend, tying Hillary Clinton to spying on her opponent and blaming Russia... Russia, Russia, Russia!
[00:43:41.502 --> 00:43:45.525]  Legacy Media tried real hard to ignore the latest Durham Report findings.
[00:43:45.945 --> 00:43:49.087]  A Washington Examiner reporter tried to question Hillary Clinton.
[00:43:49.107 --> 00:43:51.729]  What are you going to comment on the spying allegations, Hillary?
[00:43:52.369 --> 00:43:53.790]  Did you pay for them to have them spied on?
[00:43:54.791 --> 00:43:58.914]  And when MSN finally got around to reporting it, they tried to blow off the findings.
[00:43:59.665 --> 00:44:07.329]  People are desperately trying to connect Hillary Clinton with this lawyer, giving him money, saying, go spy on Donald Trump.
[00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:09.110]  That never happened.
[00:44:10.071 --> 00:44:11.411]  I should ask you, how many charges?
[00:44:11.431 --> 00:44:12.332]  There's one charge!
[00:44:12.432 --> 00:44:14.913]  And they're saying you lied to me!
[00:44:15.414 --> 00:44:24.759]  But seeing as Russia is always the scapegoat, and Tulsi Gabbard was also accused by Hillary of being a Russian agent, here's what Gabbard had to say.
[00:44:25.359 --> 00:44:28.161]  What's being revealed here, Jesse, is the truth.
[00:44:28.661 --> 00:44:41.551]  Hillary Clinton and the power elite in this country manufactured this Russian collusion lie, actively undermining our democracy and stoking the fires moving us into this new Cold War with Russia.
[00:44:42.091 --> 00:44:52.598]  By Wednesday, Killary finally breaks her silence, sharing a Vanity Fair article, and you'll never believe it, blaming Trump for the latest Durham revelations, calling them lies.
[00:44:52.938 --> 00:45:08.749]  Try as Vanity Fair and others might, a filing from Durham on Thursday argues that his reasons for making public findings asserting that a tech exec with whom Sussman was affiliated was working to dig up dirt on Trump were valid, and that any media misinterpretations do not undermine the facts.
[00:45:09.329 --> 00:45:12.593]  Jim Jordan makes this extremely obvious revelation.
[00:45:13.033 --> 00:45:17.478]  If they can spy on a sitting United States president, they can spy on anyone.
[00:45:17.699 --> 00:45:18.379]  Well, duh.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:19.501]  Where you been?
[00:45:20.001 --> 00:45:23.565]  The ACLU pretends it's breaking news with this tweet.
[00:45:24.206 --> 00:45:24.746]  Breaking!
[00:45:25.187 --> 00:45:34.693]  Newly declassified documents reveal that the CIA has been secretly conducting massive surveillance programs that capture Americans' private information.
[00:45:35.134 --> 00:45:40.738]  And truckers keep on trucking on in Canada despite it looking more like China every day.
[00:45:41.018 --> 00:45:45.300]  The level of admiration I actually have for China.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:58.865]  Media gaslights the public into thinking this peaceful protest is dangerous, while Canada's Justice Minister brazenly admits the authoritarian reaction is not about health or liberty, but purely political.
[00:45:59.065 --> 00:46:08.168]  If you are a member of, you know, a pro-Trump movement who's donating hundreds of thousands of dollars and millions of dollars to this kind of thing, then you ought to be worried.
[00:46:09.062 --> 00:46:12.503]  Propaganda pushing through media is a global epidemic.
[00:46:12.863 --> 00:46:20.246]  This German TV interviewer is pushing for a sooner jab mandate when this poked up woman suddenly starts to collapse.
[00:46:21.186 --> 00:46:24.847]  But remember folks, correlation doesn't equal causation.
[00:46:25.468 --> 00:46:29.129]  Keep on saying that, no matter how often we make this observation.
[00:46:29.869 --> 00:46:34.211]  And CNN might get an award for most times featured in media malfeasance.
[00:46:34.771 --> 00:46:37.452]  Will BS be the next out at CNN?
[00:46:38.152 --> 00:46:49.737]  Radar Online is reporting Brian Stelter might be up next to get the axe after his boss Jeff Zucker and his mistress Allison Gullist have both stepped down in response to their revealed romance.
[00:46:50.277 --> 00:46:53.779]  But it seems BS knew all along and failed to report.
[00:46:54.499 --> 00:46:59.261]  What else will be unraveled about how Brian Stelter himself broke ethical news standards?
[00:47:00.402 --> 00:47:04.285]  And finally, we've seen all kinds of definitions change over the past couple of years.
[00:47:04.606 --> 00:47:07.848]  Words like vaccine, immunity, racism.
[00:47:08.489 --> 00:47:19.959]  And instead of defending the power and intention of words, the propaganda puppets have followed in lockstep with whatever new meaning the government and its agencies deeming words should now represent.
[00:47:20.559 --> 00:47:22.461]  Is transitory up next?
[00:47:22.961 --> 00:47:32.830]  Two weeks to flatten the curve now means two or more years, and transitory or temporary inflation now just means rising, here to stay inflation.
[00:47:33.611 --> 00:47:37.314]  Here's a Saki bomb from May last year.
[00:47:39.927 --> 00:47:43.770]  They believe the impact will be temporary, transitory, however you want to refer to it.
[00:47:44.251 --> 00:47:48.034]  But they're looking at it closely, but I don't have any projections on that to make from here today.
[00:47:48.514 --> 00:47:53.618]  And legacy media ran with that, even spinning it as a good thing.
[00:47:54.339 --> 00:47:56.921]  But here we are nearly a year later.
[00:47:57.702 --> 00:48:01.625]  Price surges that are running at the fastest pace in 40 years.
[00:48:03.246 --> 00:48:07.611]  Bringing you what's ignored, sensationalized, unbalanced, misleading, or just plain false.
[00:48:08.092 --> 00:48:10.715]  That's your media malfeasance for the third week of February.
[00:48:10.995 --> 00:48:13.578]  For KLIM.News, I'm Christy Lee.
[00:48:14.839 --> 00:48:15.480]  There you go.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.823]  And all her great work is brought to you by InfoWars.com.
[00:48:17.923 --> 00:48:20.086]  So thank you so much for supporting our sponsor.
[00:48:21.013 --> 00:48:33.235]  All right, there are incredibly dangerous developments happening around the world with these sanctions now triggering Russia's own sanctions, cutting off the second largest supply of fertilizer in the world.
[00:48:33.936 --> 00:48:40.177]  When you do the equations, and I've got the articles right here, we're talking about massive starvation and death.
[00:48:40.617 --> 00:48:41.637]  This is just incredible.
[00:48:41.677 --> 00:48:43.017]  We'll be hitting that next segment.
[00:48:43.458 --> 00:48:53.260]   Also, the latest on the new permanent martial law in Canada and Klaus Schwab is in the news saying It is the motto for the world.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.741]  You must have this app to make sure you are not extreme.
[00:48:57.121 --> 00:48:59.202]  And we track what you do and control you.
[00:48:59.602 --> 00:49:01.883]  And the UN and GGP has approved it.
[00:49:02.103 --> 00:49:02.723]  These are quotes.
[00:49:04.284 --> 00:49:07.245]  So, I mean, it's all going down.
[00:49:07.325 --> 00:49:08.605]  The chains are going on.
[00:49:10.346 --> 00:49:14.447]  Right now, ladies and gentlemen, and the whole future is going to be about the resistance to this.
[00:49:14.487 --> 00:49:18.309]  Because when you submit to this, you become poor and sick and dead.
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:20.520]  There's no reason to submit.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:21.501]  There's no reason to go along.
[00:49:21.781 --> 00:49:29.124]  It's not like the Romans, you know, come into Germany 2,000 years ago and give them running water and medicine.
[00:49:29.264 --> 00:49:30.184]  And they were brutal.
[00:49:30.384 --> 00:49:31.185]  I'm not defending that.
[00:49:31.385 --> 00:49:34.686]  But, I mean, the Romans just wanted to take over and, you know, run things.
[00:49:34.986 --> 00:49:37.607]  These people want to get rid of you.
[00:49:37.627 --> 00:49:39.428]  Okay?
[00:49:40.388 --> 00:49:44.678]   So this is corporate global Hyper dominance, that's coming up.
[00:49:44.838 --> 00:49:55.084]  But I want to hit this now because this is the type of thing that's a prism or a Rosetta Stone, as I like to call it, that really educates people about how media lies and deception work.
[00:49:55.724 --> 00:50:06.090]  And they'll tell lies that are so flagrant, so ridiculous, but then put truth in it, so at least when people go check it, it's ambiguous whether they're lying or not.
[00:50:06.391 --> 00:50:08.492]  And here's a great example of Joe Rogan and myself.
[00:50:10.726 --> 00:50:17.008]  I've known Joe 23 years, been really good friends with him for a long time, and let's just say we've done a lot of wild stuff together.
[00:50:17.808 --> 00:50:21.649]  I've never made any lies about the fact that I've been a wild man in my life here and there.
[00:50:22.609 --> 00:50:31.851]  And he's moved to Austin, and we hang out pretty much every week or so, and go out to dinner, just a lot of fun stuff.
[00:50:31.871 --> 00:50:33.772]  So I know Joe very, very well.
[00:50:34.572 --> 00:50:38.053]  And I also know his security guys from Los Angeles.
[00:50:39.095 --> 00:50:43.655]   He has the same security guys. He hired some extra ones here in Austin because he's got a bigger place now.
[00:50:43.655 --> 00:50:46.375]   And you know, he's even more famous, like super superstar level.
[00:50:46.375 --> 00:50:51.655]   And so I know his security guys. I know all of them. I have dinner with them, hang out with them all the time.
[00:50:51.655 --> 00:50:57.415]   Here is the sun, and this is in other newspapers. But the reason this is important
[00:50:57.415 --> 00:51:05.095]   is that this is the tactic they use on you and on me and on Christians and on conservatives
[00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:08.375]   and on any type of orthodox group that doesn't want to be slaves to the globalists.
[00:51:08.510 --> 00:51:09.390]  I don't care if it's Muslims.
[00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:10.510]  I don't care if it's Hindus.
[00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:11.871]  I don't care if it's Amish.
[00:51:12.351 --> 00:51:13.612]  We're all under attack by this.
[00:51:15.012 --> 00:51:25.116]  So they have a headline saying he's had to hire a bunch of security because of him criticizing the vaccines and the Great Reset.
[00:51:25.196 --> 00:51:26.756]  Everyone hates him now and he's in trouble.
[00:51:27.577 --> 00:51:27.697]  No.
[00:51:28.997 --> 00:51:30.938]  I'm not going to give you the inside baseball, but let's just say this.
[00:51:31.539 --> 00:51:33.640]  Joe's happier than a pig, and you know what?
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.243]  His show has gotten way bigger, way more profitable.
[00:51:37.843 --> 00:51:40.305]  He's way more everything.
[00:51:40.345 --> 00:51:43.667]  But then they use the lie of, he's surrounded.
[00:51:43.767 --> 00:51:45.068]  Everyone's attacking his house.
[00:51:45.749 --> 00:51:47.230]  And they show where he lives.
[00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:48.190]  There's articles every day.
[00:51:48.411 --> 00:51:49.732]  Here's where Joe Rogan lives.
[00:51:50.312 --> 00:51:52.373]  Here's where he lives, if you're mad at him.
[00:51:52.954 --> 00:52:00.518]   So they're like, here's where he lives in Austin, and here's Why he's a bad person.
[00:52:01.138 --> 00:52:03.961]  That's the terrorism of these people.
[00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:12.848]  Rogan hires elite armed bodyguards to protect his family at $14.4 million home amid Spotify controversy.
[00:52:12.928 --> 00:52:19.653]  No, he has the exact same amount of bodyguards he had when he moved here.
[00:52:19.673 --> 00:52:20.494]  It's hard to believe.
[00:52:20.614 --> 00:52:21.955]  It's already been almost two years.
[00:52:23.877 --> 00:52:26.639]  He has the same amount of bodyguards.
[00:52:26.939 --> 00:52:28.120]  The same people.
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:28.981]  I'm not going to get into how many.
[00:52:30.433 --> 00:52:34.116]  And yeah, they are a bunch of former Special Forces soldiers and good guys.
[00:52:34.396 --> 00:52:35.437]  Really nice professional guys.
[00:52:35.958 --> 00:52:37.379]  But the point is, is that...
[00:52:39.994 --> 00:52:40.974]  This is a total lie.
[00:52:41.655 --> 00:52:43.055]  But you see the multi-layers.
[00:52:43.095 --> 00:52:43.876]  Here's where he lives.
[00:52:43.956 --> 00:52:44.456]  Go get him.
[00:52:44.516 --> 00:52:45.256]  Everybody hates him.
[00:52:45.297 --> 00:52:46.057]  He's under siege.
[00:52:46.397 --> 00:52:47.798]  Don't criticize the vaccines.
[00:52:47.938 --> 00:52:49.018]  You'll get hurt too.
[00:52:49.779 --> 00:52:51.479]  Same reason they say Jones is a loser.
[00:52:51.519 --> 00:52:52.360]  Jones is a racist.
[00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:53.440]  Jones is a demon.
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:59.363]  Jones is going down to scare everybody else, in Congress particularly, to not stand up to the right thing.
[00:52:59.383 --> 00:53:06.963]   That's why MGT, MTG, Marjorie Taylor Greene, MTG, Coming here and saying, people shouldn't demonize you.
[00:53:07.203 --> 00:53:08.383]  People shouldn't be scared of you.
[00:53:08.423 --> 00:53:09.224]  Tim Pool's saying that.
[00:53:09.244 --> 00:53:09.724]  Joe Rogan.
[00:53:10.024 --> 00:53:10.684]  Tucker Carlson.
[00:53:12.084 --> 00:53:15.986]  That's important because then it shows other people not to be cowards.
[00:53:16.846 --> 00:53:18.266]  And more people can now step forward.
[00:53:18.286 --> 00:53:19.487]  And it's bigger than Joe Rogan.
[00:53:19.747 --> 00:53:20.887]  It's bigger than Alex Jones.
[00:53:20.947 --> 00:53:23.808]  So that's what's happening here.
[00:53:25.666 --> 00:53:33.592]  We'll put this photo on screen, but I got to tell you, hanging out with Tim Dillon, Joe Rogan, and Mr. White was really, really fun last night.
[00:53:33.632 --> 00:53:34.533]  We talked for hours.
[00:53:35.114 --> 00:53:40.578]  It was just a great, great time, a great evening, and I was getting in bed at like 8.30.
[00:53:40.678 --> 00:53:41.479]  I was so tired.
[00:53:41.499 --> 00:53:42.600]  I didn't know Joe had been texting me.
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:48.221]  Or I'd been out with him earlier, I guess for dinner or whatever, but I still got to the club and hung out with him.
[00:53:48.621 --> 00:53:51.002]  And Joe is just so damn happy.
[00:53:51.422 --> 00:54:03.825]  And it's like any time I want, you just call Joe up, go hang out with him, and he's so awake, he knows exactly what's going on, and he's had this journey of really realizing the New World Order is real, and now he's more popular than ever, and he's just the archetypal example of victory.
[00:54:04.166 --> 00:54:09.607]  And it's such a blessing in my life to see that happening, and him being an example of courage to other people.
[00:54:10.976 --> 00:54:13.979]  But he doesn't come out and do victory laps and rub their faces in it.
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:15.541]  I will do that for him.
[00:54:16.422 --> 00:54:16.722]  Okay?
[00:54:18.224 --> 00:54:20.847]  But, it's just crazy.
[00:54:20.927 --> 00:54:22.188]  He's gotten everybody to move to Austin.
[00:54:22.248 --> 00:54:23.350]  Tim Dillon, everybody.
[00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:24.191]  Tony.
[00:54:25.506 --> 00:54:27.746]  Hinchcliffe, everybody, we had a great time last night.
[00:54:27.746 --> 00:54:32.706]   And the reason I raise that is not to name drop and go, "Oh, look, I'm really in the in-crowd here."
[00:54:32.706 --> 00:54:35.746]   No, the in-crowd is Hollywood. It's collapsed. No one wants to be part of it.
[00:54:35.746 --> 00:54:38.786]  And the new in-crowd is populace, you.
[00:54:38.786 --> 00:54:42.225]   The in-crowd is just hard-working, good people that work at a shoe store.
[00:54:42.355 --> 00:54:43.116]  Work on a farm.
[00:54:43.156 --> 00:54:43.996]  Or work at a gas station.
[00:54:44.016 --> 00:54:44.516]  It doesn't matter.
[00:54:44.536 --> 00:54:47.737]  It matters if you love God and you're a good person and you take care of your family.
[00:54:48.137 --> 00:54:49.018]  That's all that matters.
[00:54:49.438 --> 00:54:51.799]  Not all the Nike tennis shoes and all the crap.
[00:54:51.879 --> 00:54:52.759]  And Joe gets that.
[00:54:52.819 --> 00:54:53.819]  But that's why I raised this.
[00:54:54.379 --> 00:54:56.680]  And Joe even knows about this and is pissed off about it.
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:58.581]  Because he knows CNN is a pack of lying scum.
[00:54:59.841 --> 00:55:01.081]  We're talking about that coming up a little bit later.
[00:55:01.101 --> 00:55:15.024]  Remember CNN and remember Rolling Stone saying, oh, it's horsepace and thousands of people lined up at Oklahoma hospitals can't get help with their gunshot wounds because of thousands of people that got sick or died of ivermectin.
[00:55:15.164 --> 00:55:16.565]  There wasn't one sick person.
[00:55:16.765 --> 00:55:17.665]  It was all a lie.
[00:55:17.905 --> 00:55:18.565]  It was August.
[00:55:18.605 --> 00:55:26.227]  They show people in coats with masks on to get into the 110 degree temperature up in 105 degree temperature.
[00:55:26.547 --> 00:55:27.327]  It was all lies.
[00:55:27.567 --> 00:55:28.187]  It's the same people.
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:37.383]  And so now they're running, every few minutes I'm told, every break, this CNN special report, megaphone for conspiracy, the Alex Jones story.
[00:55:39.383 --> 00:55:43.005]  And all these dumb leftists are all over Twitter saying, why are they going to give him attention?
[00:55:43.285 --> 00:55:45.105]  He shouldn't have a story about him.
[00:55:45.125 --> 00:55:47.126]  I don't want to hear about Alex Jones.
[00:55:47.746 --> 00:55:49.887]  I mean, just thousands of these tweets are everywhere.
[00:55:51.104 --> 00:55:53.925]  I don't want to explain something to the dumbasses over there, okay?
[00:55:54.605 --> 00:55:56.386]  Not just at CNN, but the dumb Twitter people.
[00:55:57.146 --> 00:55:58.766]  I don't want to be on your CNN.
[00:55:59.207 --> 00:56:00.867]  I don't want to be in your fake report.
[00:56:01.007 --> 00:56:09.770]  I don't need validation by being attacked and demonized by CNN that covers up for pedophilia and every other form of evil, satanic crap there is.
[00:56:11.055 --> 00:56:13.616]  The idea that I want to be on Dateline, NBC.
[00:56:13.896 --> 00:56:15.036]  The idea that I want to be on CNN.
[00:56:15.056 --> 00:56:16.476]  Let me tell all the dumb lepers something.
[00:56:16.856 --> 00:56:18.697]  I've turned down an interview with all these people.
[00:56:18.937 --> 00:56:19.797]  With HBO.
[00:56:20.037 --> 00:56:20.797]  With all of them.
[00:56:21.037 --> 00:56:21.698]  I've turned them all down.
[00:56:21.738 --> 00:56:24.138]  I've turned Hollywood down for major movie roles.
[00:56:24.658 --> 00:56:25.539]  Starring roles.
[00:56:25.979 --> 00:56:27.979]  Two, three, five million dollar paychecks.
[00:56:28.479 --> 00:56:29.900]  I don't want you!
[00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:31.660]  I reject you!
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.121]  But I will, on my show, tell the truth about these people.
[00:56:37.562 --> 00:56:39.282]  And they sent me this letter, weeks ago.
[00:56:40.973 --> 00:56:56.787]  And it's John Ronson, who is a fiction writer that claims he writes non-fiction, that I've known 22 years, no, 24 years, 25 years, excuse me, I've known him like in 1998, known him as long as I've known Joe Rogan, met him the same year.
[00:56:57.248 --> 00:56:59.550]  This guy is the biggest snake I've ever seen in the media.
[00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:15.014]  He goes and gets these fake interviews with people where I went to school a few years in Dallas and claims I would beat up nerds like Revenge of the Nerds and that they kidnapped me and tied me up and knocked all my teeth out.
[00:57:15.034 --> 00:57:16.475]  I mean, 100% not true.
[00:57:16.875 --> 00:57:17.515]  None of it real.
[00:57:18.075 --> 00:57:20.456]  I was beat up as a middle schooler.
[00:57:20.877 --> 00:57:21.817]  I learned to fight back.
[00:57:22.197 --> 00:57:23.458]  I fought big people.
[00:57:23.518 --> 00:57:24.498]  I fought grown men.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:30.643]  And that's why they talk about one guy that I did, you know, put in the hospital for a couple weeks.
[00:57:31.384 --> 00:57:32.504]  Why was I arrested for that?
[00:57:32.524 --> 00:57:33.765]  Because I didn't start that fight.
[00:57:34.005 --> 00:57:42.912]  But literally, they're going back to create a fake origin story, ladies and gentlemen, where Alex Jones is a bully that beats up little kids.
[00:57:42.952 --> 00:57:44.993]  No, it's the left that wants to abort children.
[00:57:45.173 --> 00:57:47.155]  It's the left that wants to sexually mutilate children.
[00:57:47.375 --> 00:57:49.316]  It's the left that wants to destroy children's minds.
[00:57:49.496 --> 00:57:50.617]  It's the left that are censoring.
[00:57:50.757 --> 00:57:51.718]  It's the left that are bullies.
[00:57:52.839 --> 00:58:00.040]   So, Majid Nawaz was on with Joe Rogan And I mean, I don't have time usually to watch the whole three or four hour show.
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:00.861]  I watch clips of it.
[00:58:01.021 --> 00:58:01.882]  I watch the whole thing.
[00:58:03.023 --> 00:58:04.544]  And he destroys the Great Reset.
[00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:05.625]  He destroys the globalists.
[00:58:05.645 --> 00:58:08.588]  And he makes some really salient points.
[00:58:08.628 --> 00:58:10.570]  And the way he puts them is the best way I've heard it.
[00:58:11.491 --> 00:58:12.892]  So this is why they're coming after Joe Rogan.
[00:58:12.912 --> 00:58:14.173]  This is why they're targeting his house.
[00:58:14.233 --> 00:58:16.655]  It's why they're claiming mobs are going to attack him there.
[00:58:16.915 --> 00:58:18.637]  So mentally ill people hear that and go do it.
[00:58:19.877 --> 00:58:21.999]  Well, that's not going on, but they hope it happens.
[00:58:22.319 --> 00:58:25.821]  And he already had the security there before we moved there almost two years ago.
[00:58:26.602 --> 00:58:28.243]  But again, that's how they terrorize people.
[00:58:29.063 --> 00:58:30.564]  Very, very powerful interview.
[00:58:30.624 --> 00:58:39.109]  Here's just a few minutes of it where he explains how they create relativity and truth, but then tell you you've got to accept their absolute truths.
[00:58:40.130 --> 00:58:47.974]   Like two men can have a baby and you can't question this vaccine, but We can tell you that everything else is relative.
[00:58:48.014 --> 00:58:50.375]  It's basic cult mind control.
[00:58:50.575 --> 00:58:51.135]  He lays it out.
[00:58:51.155 --> 00:58:54.116]  I'm not just talking about government.
[00:58:54.396 --> 00:59:02.318]  I'm also talking about people that have accepted a certain narrative and find that there's a lot of other people that are along with them in this same narrative.
[00:59:02.678 --> 00:59:08.219]  And they have these media pylons, like social media pylons, where they'll attack people.
[00:59:09.219 --> 00:59:09.579]  Like you.
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:12.682]  Call you an anti-vaxxer even though you've been vaccinated.
[00:59:13.103 --> 00:59:14.524]  The same thing with Eric Clapton.
[00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:21.029]  They were angry at Eric Clapton because he spoke openly about his very extreme vaccine side effects.
[00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:24.673]  Just speaking openly as a person who was vaccinated.
[00:59:25.133 --> 00:59:27.375]  And they called him a vile anti-vaxxer.
[00:59:27.975 --> 00:59:30.137]  Well, the question is why, right?
[00:59:30.217 --> 00:59:31.418]  And it's to shut debate down.
[00:59:31.438 --> 00:59:31.699]  Yes.
[00:59:31.739 --> 00:59:33.300]  Now why would you want to shut debate down?
[00:59:34.361 --> 00:59:35.702]  I think there's a deeper point here.
[00:59:36.122 --> 00:59:45.917]   And that is that We've just come out of a time where, for a long time, moral and
[00:59:48.226 --> 00:59:50.929]  Let's just say relativism, whether it's moral or otherwise.
[00:59:51.189 --> 00:59:58.696]  Relativism, this idea that truth is relative, this idea that it's all subjective, that everything is personal experience.
[00:59:58.976 --> 01:00:00.718]  That's being promoted, yeah?
[01:00:00.778 --> 01:00:01.879]  There's no such thing as reality.
[01:00:02.379 --> 01:00:03.981]  Whether it comes down to defining a man or a woman.
[01:00:05.062 --> 01:00:09.546]  We spoke about this last time I was here with, well, it was there in California, but with Sam as well.
[01:00:09.566 --> 01:00:11.668]  We spoke about the trans debate and men and women.
[01:00:12.679 --> 01:00:20.187]  Whether it's defining a man and a woman, whether it's anything else, this idea that actually truth is all personally subjective.
[01:00:20.487 --> 01:00:21.768]  Right.
[01:00:22.088 --> 01:00:47.993]   When you promote the idea that there's no such thing as truth, and when you shut down debate that is seeking truth, not that it claims truth, but is seeking it, when you shut that debate down, in aid of this idea that truth is relative, Like those, for example, who now know the science that the Covid vaccination doesn't stop infection or transmission and doesn't reduce it beyond 12 weeks.
[01:00:48.293 --> 01:00:49.693]  The booster shot, by the way, is eight weeks.
[01:00:50.693 --> 01:00:57.995]  But having known that, and they still insist on vaccine passports, it's no longer about seeking the truth for them.
[01:00:59.036 --> 01:01:00.856]  The truth is relative and it serves a purpose.
[01:01:00.896 --> 01:01:01.957]  What happens when you do that?
[01:01:03.397 --> 01:01:06.738]  When there's no such thing as truth, you can't define reality.
[01:01:07.645 --> 01:01:10.610]  And when you can't define reality, the only thing that matters is power.
[01:01:12.216 --> 01:01:12.736]  You're a father.
[01:01:13.257 --> 01:01:14.017]  Now, we're your child.
[01:01:14.757 --> 01:01:15.978]  Children who can't reason.
[01:01:16.378 --> 01:01:17.379]  Like, my kid's five.
[01:01:17.399 --> 01:01:19.200]  I mean, his reasoning abilities are great, but he's five.
[01:01:19.660 --> 01:01:19.820]  Right?
[01:01:20.101 --> 01:01:22.602]  It's why you say to the child, because I said so, do it.
[01:01:22.782 --> 01:01:23.322]  It's good for you.
[01:01:24.003 --> 01:01:26.004]  Because they don't know how to reason yet.
[01:01:26.484 --> 01:01:26.684]  Yeah?
[01:01:27.105 --> 01:01:32.748]  And you try, and if something's too complex, you say, I'll explain another time, but right now you have to listen to your father, don't do this.
[01:01:33.628 --> 01:01:36.788]   When you can't, when there's no such thing as truth, because everything's relative,
[01:01:36.788 --> 01:01:41.427]   the only thing that matters is power, because power gets to define reality.
[01:01:41.427 --> 01:01:44.948]  And this brings us to the hybrid war we're in right now.
[01:01:44.948 --> 01:01:50.667]   And that's why people that are in power who are seeking a specific outcome
[01:01:50.667 --> 01:01:53.467]   from the world that we're in, want to shut debate down.
[01:01:53.467 --> 01:01:55.827]  What they're not interested in is seeking truth.
[01:01:55.827 --> 01:02:01.268]   What they're interested in is shutting that debate down because power steps into that void
[01:02:01.268 --> 01:02:05.688]   when reason no longer exists and gets to define reality for you from up above.
[01:02:06.325 --> 01:02:14.190]  And it's why it's so important in a dictatorship that the only thing you have left when all your power is taken from you is the truth.
[01:02:14.350 --> 01:02:28.991]   And if you read Orwell, if you look at 1984, it's why he spends so much time talking about how The power he was writing about in that fictional account is attempting to redefine reality, redefine the past, redefine the future.
[01:02:29.711 --> 01:02:37.636]  Because if you can't hold on to reality, you have no premise to scrutinize the government for whether they're telling you the truth or not.
[01:02:38.396 --> 01:02:40.938]  And it's really, it is a war in that sense, hybrid war.
[01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:44.800]  So information in that war becomes your most powerful weapon.
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:52.264]  Now most people don't have the privilege of researching these debates, foreign policy, war on terror, Covid, whatever it is.
[01:02:52.684 --> 01:02:59.148]  People don't have the privilege because they're working 9 to 5, a minimum wage and they're hungry and they're just busy trying to live and survive.
[01:02:59.549 --> 01:03:06.132]  What they normally do is they outsource their thinking on where the truth lies to trusted voices in the media.
[01:03:06.973 --> 01:03:10.055]  So it's why it becomes so important to manipulate the media.
[01:03:10.715 --> 01:03:20.063]  So that those trusted voices that people are looking to are no longer giving them at least the best understanding of the truth they have, but are also peddling the agenda of power.
[01:03:21.124 --> 01:03:33.315]  When you're in a situation like that, it becomes difficult to define reality and therefore difficult to challenge government on whether or not they are sticking to their promises, because everything gets shifted, everything's relative.
[01:03:33.575 --> 01:03:34.917]  The Overton window keeps moving.
[01:03:35.237 --> 01:03:36.458]  The goalposts keep shifting.
[01:03:38.675 --> 01:03:39.976]  Very powerful piece.
[01:03:40.296 --> 01:03:42.177]  Rogan speechless as gas breaks down.
[01:03:42.238 --> 01:03:43.338]  Klaus Schwab's great reset.
[01:03:43.378 --> 01:03:44.259]  Infiltration of the world.
[01:03:44.479 --> 01:03:44.859]  Governments.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:47.041]  That's only one of the clips I just played.
[01:03:47.061 --> 01:03:51.624]  That guy's dead on about what we're dealing with.
[01:03:52.124 --> 01:03:53.425]  Dead on.
[01:03:54.966 --> 01:03:56.087]  Take away the foundation.
[01:03:56.547 --> 01:03:57.588]  Take away any mooring.
[01:03:57.988 --> 01:03:58.989]  Take your eyes away.
[01:03:59.029 --> 01:03:59.810]  Take your ears away.
[01:03:59.850 --> 01:04:00.650]  Take your taste away.
[01:04:01.031 --> 01:04:04.393]  Take everything away and just tell you now, this is what's real.
[01:04:06.727 --> 01:04:08.908]  Two women had a baby in a California prison.
[01:04:08.968 --> 01:04:12.350]  No, a man saying they were a woman was allowed in to rape a woman.
[01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:13.210]  They raped her.
[01:04:14.871 --> 01:04:17.552]  But once you go along with that lie, now you ignore the rape.
[01:04:19.093 --> 01:04:24.896]  You see, and that's the thing about going along with evil, is that it always demands more reality.
[01:04:26.038 --> 01:04:28.139]  Because it can't operate in reality.
[01:04:28.399 --> 01:04:29.139]  I mean, it's like Biden.
[01:04:29.159 --> 01:04:30.639]  I could play the clips all day making fun of him.
[01:04:30.979 --> 01:04:33.140]  He doesn't even know where he is.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:36.661]  He's addressing a foreign power that just took over a part of the world.
[01:04:37.641 --> 01:04:42.983]  He can't string together one coherent sentence.
[01:04:43.303 --> 01:04:46.344]  And isn't he emblematic of the dying American empire?
[01:04:47.964 --> 01:04:50.265]  Because the globalists used America to set the empire up.
[01:04:50.545 --> 01:04:52.646]  But everybody knows it's the American empire.
[01:04:53.695 --> 01:04:57.417]  And everybody knows it's full of crap and evil and decadent and run by scum.
[01:04:58.217 --> 01:05:00.718]  Do you want to be represented by scum?
[01:05:02.779 --> 01:05:05.500]  Do you want to be represented by people like that?
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.701]  And no, the answer is no.
[01:05:07.481 --> 01:05:07.661]  No.
[01:05:07.781 --> 01:05:08.442]  So that's what I'm saying.
[01:05:08.882 --> 01:05:13.304]  It's not a hatred of the Democratic Party or the Republican establishment or Hollywood.
[01:05:13.364 --> 01:05:15.385]  It's a more of, we are not with you.
[01:05:15.885 --> 01:05:17.886]  We reject you.
[01:05:18.988 --> 01:05:20.010]  We don't like you.
[01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:21.512]  We don't believe in you.
[01:05:21.872 --> 01:05:23.334]  We don't want to be part of you.
[01:05:23.735 --> 01:05:30.484]  We do not want to be involved in any sort of commerce with you.
[01:05:30.824 --> 01:05:31.645]  It's very simple.
[01:05:33.788 --> 01:05:39.987]   and monetize people and censor people and bully people and do all this because they want to rape us politically,
[01:05:39.987 --> 01:05:41.108]  culturally, physically.
[01:05:41.108 --> 01:05:42.507]  They want to dominate us.
[01:05:42.507 --> 01:05:46.547]   They want us to submit to Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates' New World Order,
[01:05:46.547 --> 01:05:49.427]  like every other empire and every other power mad group.
[01:05:49.427 --> 01:05:53.827]   And I don't care what group it is, you are not gonna get me to submit to anything,
[01:05:53.827 --> 01:05:56.068]  but my inner compass is connected to God.
[01:05:56.068 --> 01:06:00.188]  We'll be right back with our special guest in studio.
[01:06:00.188 --> 01:06:02.588]  'Cause I thought about this guest a few weeks ago.
[01:06:01.564 --> 01:06:04.367]  I wanted to get him back because this is a solution.
[01:06:04.807 --> 01:06:09.672]  You know, it's not going to save the world, but things like this are going to really change the world.
[01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:12.135]  And with a lot of things like this happening, we will save the world.
[01:06:13.076 --> 01:06:20.775]   All right, folks, he was on with us a few months ago in the middle of the Big upswing in COVID in the United States.
[01:06:20.835 --> 01:06:22.456]  And we got a lot of great feedback from listeners.
[01:06:22.516 --> 01:06:24.038]  And so I was thinking about him a few weeks ago.
[01:06:24.578 --> 01:06:27.701]  I wanted to get him in studio because so much has happened.
[01:06:28.302 --> 01:06:29.523]  He's Dr. Syed Haider.
[01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:38.771]  He's a doctor who specializes in internal medicine, who's treated over 35,000 patients, over 4,000 with active COVID infections.
[01:06:38.811 --> 01:06:43.496]  I think the number is higher now than we had in my last time, resulting in zero deaths with only five hospitalizations.
[01:06:43.996 --> 01:06:46.879]  Over 30,000 were given ongoing preventative ivermectin.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:53.106]  Of those who took ivermectin to prevent catching COVID, less than 10 returned with active COVID infections.
[01:06:53.487 --> 01:06:57.231]  With the breaking news of USPS and FDA are colluding to withhold.
[01:06:58.394 --> 01:07:00.115]  Overseas, I've remitted shipments to Americans.
[01:07:00.175 --> 01:07:05.117]  Dr. Saeed is working to counteract this crisis by sourcing the cheapest U.S.
[01:07:05.177 --> 01:07:06.958]  mail-order pharmacies in each state.
[01:07:07.759 --> 01:07:15.842]  This bold action will provide Americans with life-saving drugs before they get sick, or once they have already begun to get sick with the first day of symptoms.
[01:07:16.263 --> 01:07:17.743]  MyGoToDoc.com.
[01:07:20.535 --> 01:07:25.799]  I've had on other doctors and other groups and other organizations that are great, Dr. Marble and many others.
[01:07:26.159 --> 01:07:28.521]  They get overwhelmed, two, three day waits.
[01:07:28.561 --> 01:07:38.969]  These folks have one of the fastest responses and the reason I wanted him on now and of course before was we get inundated with calls by listeners.
[01:07:39.813 --> 01:07:42.115]  And we go through the emails every day and try to respond.
[01:07:42.435 --> 01:07:47.499]  We can't usually respond to emails, but it's like we're murdering people if we don't when they're asking for information.
[01:07:47.939 --> 01:07:55.904]  And we've gotten really great feedback with these folks, you know, a few hours to a day for people to get a response depending on how the flood of phone calls are coming in.
[01:07:55.924 --> 01:08:10.695]   What I think is important in what they're doing is Preventatively, to be able to stockpile, which I've already done before I ever met you guys, for family and friends and others, because this is not cocaine or something, this is Ivermectin and other things that are completely safe and healthy and right out there on the record.
[01:08:10.975 --> 01:08:28.187]   And now all these studies are coming out, since you were last on, validating what everybody anecdotally could see, so I want to talk about Ivermectin with you and so much more, because if you don't think they're going to have another wave, as Bill Gates has said, or a new thing, you know, this month, next month, or, you know, next fall, next winter, You're crazy, folks.
[01:08:28.207 --> 01:08:31.209]  This is definitely a rollout of a synthetic virus, in my view.
[01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:34.911]  So, I really appreciate Dr. Seed Hader joining us.
[01:08:35.411 --> 01:08:37.792]  You can go to mygotodoc.com.
[01:08:37.832 --> 01:08:41.775]  That's M, uppercase, mygotodoc.com.
[01:08:42.515 --> 01:08:43.956]  Doc, where's the best place for people to go visit?
[01:08:44.236 --> 01:08:44.656]  That's it.
[01:08:44.696 --> 01:08:46.897]  I mean, upper, lower case, it doesn't matter in a web browser.
[01:08:46.917 --> 01:08:48.458]  So it's just mygotodoc.com.
[01:08:48.478 --> 01:08:51.058]  That's M-Y-G-O-T-O-D-O-C dot com.
[01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:57.000]  And yeah, I mean, the main thing I think that people need to realize now is that this isn't over.
[01:08:57.101 --> 01:08:57.961]  It's far from over.
[01:08:58.641 --> 01:09:00.882]  And the problem is that it is a bioweapon, right?
[01:09:01.722 --> 01:09:05.285]  Um, and so, so the bioweapon is dangerous itself.
[01:09:05.425 --> 01:09:09.928]  Certainly vaccines are probably more dangerous than the virus, certainly more dangerous than the virus itself.
[01:09:10.568 --> 01:09:16.592]  Um, but to be fooled into thinking that the real payload is, is the vaccine, you know, that, that's an error, right?
[01:09:16.712 --> 01:09:22.876]  So the, the virus itself, um, is also extremely dangerous and it's mutating to become even more dangerous.
[01:09:22.936 --> 01:09:23.557]  Oh, I got it.
[01:09:23.617 --> 01:09:24.477]  I know I had Delta.
[01:09:24.517 --> 01:09:24.978]  It was bad.
[01:09:26.011 --> 01:09:36.634]  So they said, and I agree, Omicron was not as severe as Delta or some of the earlier variants, but not severe doesn't mean it's not bad.
[01:09:37.174 --> 01:09:41.835]  So the Omicron variant causes pretty severe illness.
[01:09:42.035 --> 01:09:46.657]  So by not severe, what's meant medically is that it doesn't cause as much hospitalization and death.
[01:09:47.637 --> 01:09:51.962]  What we're not talking about here, and we haven't really been talking about it since the beginning, is long COVID.
[01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:55.507]  So long COVID is very similar to vaccine injuries.
[01:09:55.907 --> 01:10:02.515]  And anywhere from like 50 to 60 percent of everyone who gets this virus ends up with what they know is long COVID.
[01:10:02.535 --> 01:10:04.097]  They have the symptoms of long COVID.
[01:10:04.678 --> 01:10:06.961]  Oh, I know a lot of people it's happened to, including this office.
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:09.861]  Yeah, and it's not a walk in the park.
[01:10:09.921 --> 01:10:11.042]  It can be devastating.
[01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:12.823]  It can make it hard to work.
[01:10:12.843 --> 01:10:13.903]  Do we know what's causing it?
[01:10:13.923 --> 01:10:15.104]  Is it the spike protein?
[01:10:15.204 --> 01:10:16.644]  It's the spike protein, exactly.
[01:10:16.704 --> 01:10:17.645]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:10:17.665 --> 01:10:34.473]  And that's the key thing to realize here, that if you get infected, the spike protein, which is the real payload here, that's what's causing damage in long COVID and in acute COVID, that gets introduced in your body and it doesn't leave sometimes for months, maybe for years, and it gets stuck inside your immune cells.
[01:10:34.793 --> 01:10:36.415]  That's what other doctors and studies have said.
[01:10:36.435 --> 01:10:50.936]  Again, I'm not a doctor like you, but that it's the spike protein studies now up to a year or longer because time keeps going, but from the beginning of this and that what I've heard from other doctors is people are now taking cycles of ivermectin and things just to make sure it's cleared out.
[01:10:51.687 --> 01:11:06.091]  Yeah, so we're doing a lot of long COVID treatments and the most important thing for us is to get medication into the hands of patients before they get sick so that they have it ready to go on day one and they can cut short the illness and prevent long COVID from happening.
[01:11:06.891 --> 01:11:07.672]  So that's really important.
[01:11:07.692 --> 01:11:13.193]  You want to minimize the amount of virus in your body and you want to minimize the amount of spike protein that ends up in your body.
[01:11:13.213 --> 01:11:15.454]  Do we know, doctor, what ivermectin does?
[01:11:15.474 --> 01:11:16.254]  Everybody asks me that.
[01:11:16.374 --> 01:11:19.455]  Why is it such a miracle drug in all these studies and everywhere?
[01:11:20.035 --> 01:11:23.317]  Yeah, so basically it blocks the binding of the virus to your cells.
[01:11:23.477 --> 01:11:25.798]  That's the really big thing that it does.
[01:11:25.858 --> 01:11:31.041]  So it's got that antiviral effect and then it has anti-inflammatory effects for long COVID specifically.
[01:11:31.121 --> 01:11:35.643]  So it prevents certain interleukins from going up in numbers in your body.
[01:11:35.683 --> 01:11:39.005]  So the virus, first of all, it's multiplying in your body and you got to stop that.
[01:11:39.445 --> 01:11:41.426]  Ivermectin does that, you know, because it blocks the entry.
[01:11:42.026 --> 01:11:44.488]  And then you've got to stop the inflammation that the virus causes.
[01:11:44.588 --> 01:11:50.833]  So you're always going to have some virus that's multiplied, it's kicking up inflammation, and then ivermectin targets that specific inflammation.
[01:11:50.893 --> 01:11:52.634]  It stops that inflammation from happening.
[01:11:53.275 --> 01:11:57.017]  It binds to the spike protein itself, helps your body to get rid of it.
[01:11:57.458 --> 01:12:01.661]  So it really does a tremendous job for COVID-19 specifically.
[01:12:01.681 --> 01:12:05.564]  It has a number of really important specific effects for COVID-19.
[01:12:05.984 --> 01:12:11.526]  And then we see all the reports out there where people try to get it for their family members and can't, or they get a court order.
[01:12:11.566 --> 01:12:14.368]  They start it, then the court order elapses, and then they die.
[01:12:14.408 --> 01:12:21.631]  But for everybody I've known, including family that was on death's doorstep, within six, seven hours of ivermectin, they were bouncing back.
[01:12:21.911 --> 01:12:22.491]  It was incredible.
[01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:26.333]  And I know when I took ivermectin, it was within a day, I felt way better.
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.341]  Yeah, and we get that a lot.
[01:12:28.381 --> 01:12:33.044]  We get it from people mostly who have the acute infection and especially if you start in the first couple of days.
[01:12:33.084 --> 01:12:37.046]  So I used to say start in the first, you know, four or five days and you'll be fine.
[01:12:37.447 --> 01:12:46.972]  But the problem, you know, that we're seeing here, that again is not being really talked about a lot in the mainstream media or even the alternative media, is that the virus is getting harder and harder to treat, even with ivermectin.
[01:12:47.072 --> 01:12:50.735]  You have to use higher doses, you have to start earlier, and you have to treat it for longer.
[01:12:53.236 --> 01:12:58.699]  It's evolving and it may actually be evolving because people aren't taking my direction seriously.
[01:12:58.999 --> 01:13:02.881]  First of all, we're not using the whole protocol.
[01:13:02.901 --> 01:13:04.842]  A lot of people just want to use ivermectin.
[01:13:04.862 --> 01:13:06.663]  You've got to use a number of different drugs.
[01:13:06.723 --> 01:13:10.645]  Nowadays, we're actually recommending hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin together.
[01:13:11.106 --> 01:13:11.966]  Sure, so it's a cocktail.
[01:13:11.986 --> 01:13:13.087]  That's what other doctors say.
[01:13:13.107 --> 01:13:13.947]  What do people need to have?
[01:13:15.848 --> 01:13:20.771]  So Ivermectin, Hydroxychloroquine, I recommend for everyone with Omicron and the future variants.
[01:13:21.171 --> 01:13:23.452]  I highly recommend Fluvoxamine or Prozac.
[01:13:23.752 --> 01:13:25.093]  It works really well for COVID.
[01:13:25.133 --> 01:13:29.815]  It doesn't affect your brain in 99.9% of people who just take it for two weeks for COVID.
[01:13:30.195 --> 01:13:31.976]  So it's really safe, very effective.
[01:13:32.036 --> 01:13:33.617]  I mean, I don't just believe you though.
[01:13:33.637 --> 01:13:34.217]  You're a great guy.
[01:13:34.517 --> 01:13:39.020]  Everybody knows from literature, two, three, four weeks for serotonin reuptake inhibitors to kick in.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.220]  So you're only getting this.
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:43.462]  And so how does the serotonin reuptake inhibitor, how is it blocking it?
[01:13:43.962 --> 01:13:45.923]  Yeah, so it shows how powerful it is.
[01:13:46.144 --> 01:13:46.384]  Yeah.
[01:13:46.444 --> 01:13:46.804]  No, no, no.
[01:13:46.864 --> 01:13:51.127]  So it has serotonin is a big part of the pathology of this virus.
[01:13:51.587 --> 01:13:57.871]  And so what happens is that the virus causes your platelets to dump serotonin, huge amounts of serotonin into your bloodstream.
[01:13:58.091 --> 01:14:01.053]  And this is really inflammatory neurotransmitter when it's in your bloodstream.
[01:14:01.093 --> 01:14:02.014]  It's not supposed to be there.
[01:14:02.194 --> 01:14:02.414]  Okay.
[01:14:02.915 --> 01:14:04.476]  Or it's not supposed to be there in that quantity.
[01:14:05.216 --> 01:14:08.458]  So it caught that itself starts to trigger the cytokine storm.
[01:14:08.659 --> 01:14:13.642]  And so one of the effects of fluvoxamine is it stops the platelets from dumping the serotonin out.
[01:14:14.242 --> 01:14:17.081]  And then it has other anti-inflammatory effects.
[01:14:17.081 --> 01:14:20.762]   It also may have some antiviral effects for the beginning of the infection.
[01:14:20.762 --> 01:14:23.802]   But the main thing is it prevents that really bad cytokine storm
[01:14:23.802 --> 01:14:27.081]  that really kicks in in the second week of the infection.
[01:14:27.081 --> 01:14:30.481]   When we come back, 'cause a lot of people that have long COVID,
[01:14:30.481 --> 01:14:34.481]   I mean, clearly, it happened to my dad, it happened to other people I really care about in this
[01:14:34.481 --> 01:14:37.801]   office and I never really felt completely the same after it.
[01:14:37.801 --> 01:14:41.101]   And a lot of doctors I've talked to said, well, you should just go on a regimen
[01:14:41.101 --> 01:14:45.202]  to clean it out of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
[01:14:45.202 --> 01:14:49.280]   And I've been told by other doctors other than you, in fact, my family doctor said,
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.521]  you might take two weeks of fluvoxamine.
[01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:53.320]  Is that done after?
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.162]  Or how does it work? - Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:54.162 --> 01:14:55.001]  You can take it after.
[01:14:55.001 --> 01:14:56.402]  So it just cleans things out.
[01:14:56.423 --> 01:15:00.925]  Yeah, so basically it helps your body to stop the inflammation that the spike protein's causing.
[01:15:00.945 --> 01:15:02.346]  I never thought I'd be endorsing Prozac.
[01:15:02.686 --> 01:15:03.666]  Yeah, right, me neither.
[01:15:03.726 --> 01:15:06.767]  Seriously, I'm so anti, you know, psychiatric drugs.
[01:15:06.948 --> 01:15:11.049]  But, you know, I'm just talking about two weeks, you know, two, three weeks, maybe a little longer for longer.
[01:15:11.069 --> 01:15:12.150]  Well, it shows how powerful it is.
[01:15:12.170 --> 01:15:12.770]  Like I said, I mean...
[01:15:13.450 --> 01:15:21.696]  It really does, and that may be one reason that it's used in depression, because it has an anti-inflammatory effect, and some depression is an inflammatory illness anyway.
[01:15:22.456 --> 01:15:31.682]  But yeah, it's really important, and we want people to have it in case they get long COVID symptoms, because some people, they had the virus, and they feel fine, and then long COVID will suddenly hit them.
[01:15:31.722 --> 01:15:32.522]  It starts replicating.
[01:15:32.943 --> 01:15:34.083]  Let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:15:34.103 --> 01:15:35.724]  This is just fascinating information.
[01:15:36.325 --> 01:15:38.326]  Dr. Syed Haider is our guest.
[01:15:38.967 --> 01:15:40.628]  He is here in studio.
[01:15:41.488 --> 01:15:46.131]  And he's a classy guy, putting up with me with my Texas drawl butcher and his great name.
[01:15:46.691 --> 01:15:50.234]  But man, just the way you lay it out, my audience really liked it when you came on.
[01:15:50.734 --> 01:15:59.079]  And I've also talked to a lot of the listeners and other people and doctors about one of the best groups out there that is actually getting to people, getting back with them and helping them.
[01:15:59.099 --> 01:16:04.563]  Because we are still under siege with people calling us saying, where do I get ivermectin?
[01:16:04.603 --> 01:16:06.044]  Where do I get hydroxychloroquine?
[01:16:06.084 --> 01:16:07.745]  Where do I get this stuff?
[01:16:07.765 --> 01:16:11.897]   And that's what I've told listeners is, You need to stockpile it.
[01:16:12.198 --> 01:16:14.120]  And there's a legal, lawful way to do that.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.743]  You can call this guy, and he knows how to get it done.
[01:16:16.783 --> 01:16:19.306]  So you've got the floor for the rest of the segment in the next hour.
[01:16:19.326 --> 01:16:22.951]  I know I've been ranting here, but how do folks protect themselves?
[01:16:22.991 --> 01:16:23.952]  What do you recommend they do?
[01:16:23.992 --> 01:16:25.634]  And what are the other big points you want to make?
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:36.766]  Yeah, so I think we need to kind of, when we see what's going on in the mainstream media, you know, from the very beginning, right, there was a lot of fear porn, right?
[01:16:37.166 --> 01:16:47.052]  And now they're trying, they're kind of slowly pivoting to starting to minimize, actually, the pandemic and say, okay, it's almost over, it's done, you know, we don't need lockdowns anymore, stuff like that, right?
[01:16:47.372 --> 01:16:48.653]  So why is that, right?
[01:16:48.673 --> 01:16:59.357]   And I'm sure Alex has probably talked about a lot of this before, but I just want to mention it, you know, In my view, the fear porn from the start was to, you know, was to attack Donald Trump, get Trump out of office, right?
[01:16:59.457 --> 01:17:01.057]  To destroy his presidency and get him out.
[01:17:01.577 --> 01:17:02.217]  That was one reason.
[01:17:02.717 --> 01:17:05.518]  Another reason was for government to take more power, right?
[01:17:05.598 --> 01:17:07.919]  Lockdowns, mass mandates, vaccine mandates.
[01:17:07.959 --> 01:17:10.740]  I mean, this is all loss of medical freedom, loss of autonomy.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.660]  You know, government is expanding its power.
[01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.201]  And number three, obviously, Big Pharma is in bed with government.
[01:17:15.621 --> 01:17:19.922]  They make a lot of money, you know, so there was a lot of money to be made and media is in bed with Big Pharma.
[01:17:20.562 --> 01:17:24.424]  But now, like, why are they pivoting away from, you know, all this fear porn?
[01:17:24.704 --> 01:17:25.905]  And that's what I'm seeing in the media now.
[01:17:25.925 --> 01:17:30.087]  I'm seeing a lot of articles kind of minimizing things and saying, oh, don't worry, it's almost over.
[01:17:30.107 --> 01:17:31.147]  Because it backfired on them.
[01:17:31.888 --> 01:17:34.009]  Well, also midterms are coming up.
[01:17:34.209 --> 01:17:34.629]  I agree, yeah.
[01:17:34.789 --> 01:17:35.229]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:35.309 --> 01:17:36.270]  It did backfire, right?
[01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:38.091]  So the economy's in shambles.
[01:17:38.271 --> 01:17:40.152]  They want to try to save midterms.
[01:17:40.172 --> 01:17:44.514]  I don't think they can at this point, but they're trying to do their best to minimize the damage they're going to have in midterms.
[01:17:45.234 --> 01:17:53.058]  Number two, what people may not be thinking about is, I love the trucker convoy thing here and also in Canada.
[01:17:53.418 --> 01:17:54.318]  I'm a big supporter of that.
[01:17:54.338 --> 01:17:58.860]  But it could be used to blame the breakdown of society on them instead of the lockdowns.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:17:59.681]  Exactly.
[01:18:00.061 --> 01:18:01.802]  So what happened in Canada, right?
[01:18:01.842 --> 01:18:04.383]  That's the playbook they're going to follow here.
[01:18:04.483 --> 01:18:07.304]  We have martial law in Canada, right?
[01:18:07.664 --> 01:18:12.027]   So this great movement But it triggered something terrible, right?
[01:18:12.067 --> 01:18:16.229]  Like, they weren't, they didn't have enough of the people behind them, right?
[01:18:16.269 --> 01:18:17.370]  It was just some truckers.
[01:18:17.390 --> 01:18:21.693]  That's right, and more people, which they said were going to show up, showed up peacefully than it would if we would have had a victory.
[01:18:22.013 --> 01:18:22.814]  But it wasn't enough.
[01:18:22.854 --> 01:18:26.396]  It's like the Alamo fell and then Sam Houston never showed up.
[01:18:26.736 --> 01:18:26.956]  Right.
[01:18:27.256 --> 01:18:28.057]  So what's going to happen?
[01:18:28.117 --> 01:18:29.978]  Truckers descend on Washington, D.C.
[01:18:30.578 --> 01:18:31.959]  Is Marshall Law in the U.S.
[01:18:32.019 --> 01:18:32.279]  next?
[01:18:32.519 --> 01:18:33.719]  Or some version of it?
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.341]  They're going to call it something else, but it's going to effectively be that?
[01:18:37.601 --> 01:18:39.262]  Are they going to ratchet up the power grab?
[01:18:39.902 --> 01:18:40.983]  And what happens then, right?
[01:18:41.023 --> 01:18:41.903]  Frozen bank accounts?
[01:18:42.003 --> 01:18:43.244]  Is my bank account going to be frozen?
[01:18:43.264 --> 01:18:46.986]  By the way, I'd like to invite you sometimes to host the show.
[01:18:47.046 --> 01:18:47.726]  You're really smart.
[01:18:47.786 --> 01:18:49.027]  I'm going to interrupt him.
[01:18:49.047 --> 01:18:49.627]  You're dead on.
[01:18:49.647 --> 01:18:50.448]  I agree with everything you're saying.
[01:18:50.468 --> 01:18:50.908]  I'd love to.
[01:18:51.508 --> 01:18:55.409]  Yeah, so you've got to prepare, right?
[01:18:55.509 --> 01:19:02.411]  So I know a lot of people, I've gone through your website, I've listened to you before, and a lot of your listeners want to be prepared, right?
[01:19:02.891 --> 01:19:06.592]  They buy food in case the society starts to break down.
[01:19:07.092 --> 01:19:08.873]  And this is a form of wisdom, right?
[01:19:08.933 --> 01:19:10.073]  Our ancestors used to do this.
[01:19:10.113 --> 01:19:14.094]  Our ancestors used to keep six months to a year's supply of food in case of famine.
[01:19:14.694 --> 01:19:16.134]  And so what is this?
[01:19:16.454 --> 01:19:18.295]  What am I telling people to do right now?
[01:19:18.795 --> 01:19:26.504]  Is to go and get your meds, put them in your medicine cabinet, and be prepared because it's a form of health insurance and you don't have coverage for this.
[01:19:26.724 --> 01:19:27.044]  Okay.
[01:19:27.625 --> 01:19:33.631]  If you get a new virus or a similar one pops up, or this current one, there's going to be runs on it again and people aren't able to get it.
[01:19:33.671 --> 01:19:38.577]  People need to use this lull, which I agree isn't a real lull, they're just trying to make people forget about it, to get ready.
[01:19:38.937 --> 01:19:41.580]  Yeah, and it's not just that it may not become available.
[01:19:41.620 --> 01:19:43.662]  The point is that you need to start on day one, right?
[01:19:43.682 --> 01:19:45.644]  We used to say start in the first five to six days.
[01:19:45.724 --> 01:19:47.365]  Now I'm saying start on day one.
[01:19:47.405 --> 01:19:47.986]  Don't wait.
[01:19:48.346 --> 01:19:49.307]  Don't go and get tested.
[01:19:49.708 --> 01:19:50.749]  You start feeling the sniffles.
[01:19:50.769 --> 01:19:52.070]  You start feeling the tickle in the throat.
[01:19:52.410 --> 01:19:53.391]  Throw everything at it.
[01:19:53.431 --> 01:19:54.512]  Throw the kitchen sink at it.
[01:19:54.532 --> 01:19:58.937]  Yeah, that's key, because when they say you're positive, then they send you home to wait till you get really sick and then kill you.
[01:19:59.457 --> 01:19:59.677]  Yeah.
[01:19:59.757 --> 01:19:59.997]  Sick.
[01:20:00.378 --> 01:20:00.938]  Totally evil.
[01:20:00.998 --> 01:20:08.144]  So the pandemic, I'm not trying to be a fear monger here because it's easy to deal with, especially if you treat it on day one.
[01:20:08.184 --> 01:20:10.926]  Well, the whole enemy of the people has been trying to block this information.
[01:20:11.446 --> 01:20:12.347]  And so absolutely.
[01:20:12.827 --> 01:20:22.835]  And it's been one good thing Trump did was, I guess, make it easier for these online systems, the great doctors like yourself, to get things to people and democratize this and not have a monopoly.
[01:20:23.175 --> 01:20:26.258]  That's why it's so important to write this down and share it with others.
[01:20:26.518 --> 01:20:31.917]   and tell others, "Hey, you need to go to my doctor, "or my go to doc.com."
[01:20:31.917 --> 01:20:34.677]  One word, my go to doc.com.
[01:20:34.677 --> 01:20:39.356]   You need to write that down, you need to share that, and you need to get prepared ahead of time.
[01:20:39.356 --> 01:20:42.518]  And I personally am already planning to do this.
[01:20:42.518 --> 01:20:49.716]   I'm doing a regimen of the hydroxychloroquine, of the ivermectin, I've got it in my office.
[01:20:49.716 --> 01:20:51.997]  I've decided I'm going to start on it Saturday.
[01:20:51.997 --> 01:20:56.237]   I'm going to take it again, just because of all that I've personally seen, to make sure any of this crap
[01:20:56.237 --> 01:21:01.717]  cleared out of me because again folks this is very serious.
[01:21:00.487 --> 01:21:13.039]  Yeah, so along those lines there's some people who feel like they're totally normal and you know when you check them when you run an MRI scan or something you find they have heart inflammation or there's something going on in their body and there's only one company out there that I work with a lot.
[01:21:13.099 --> 01:21:15.001]  It's InCellDx, it's Bruce Patterson's group.
[01:21:15.422 --> 01:21:21.948]  They have a test to see if you still have the spike protein in your body and if it's causing the inflammation which you see in long COVID patients.
[01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:24.251]  You know, we don't know.
[01:21:24.271 --> 01:21:28.235]  There's probably a lot of silent, long COVID that's causing disease.
[01:21:28.256 --> 01:21:33.422]  You know, it's causing heart attacks, it's causing strokes, and we don't know that that's what's causing it, right?
[01:21:33.462 --> 01:21:38.128]  Like, your parents, your elderly parents had COVID, and then a year later they die of a stroke.
[01:21:38.468 --> 01:21:41.050]  Maybe they wouldn't have had that stroke if they hadn't had COVID.
[01:21:41.591 --> 01:21:42.612]  And I totally agree.
[01:21:42.632 --> 01:21:45.534]  The vaccines are worse, and the vaccines can also be treated the same way.
[01:21:45.635 --> 01:21:48.097]  You can also check to see if the spike protein is still in your body.
[01:21:48.577 --> 01:21:50.359]  You can check to see if it's causing inflammation.
[01:21:50.379 --> 01:21:52.100]  It does the same thing that long COVID does.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:52.941]  And I've got to just back you up.
[01:21:52.961 --> 01:21:57.725]  I've had so many top doctors and scientists on, and I said, what do you do if you've already had to have it for your job?
[01:21:57.745 --> 01:22:01.609]  And they said, the way you treat COVID is the way you treat any potential vaccine damage.
[01:22:01.869 --> 01:22:09.812]  Yeah, and so if you want to be sure, if you want to, you know, make sure you're not wasting your time taking medications you don't need, you can go to covidlonghaulers.com.
[01:22:09.832 --> 01:22:22.617]  It's a website that works, that's InCellDx's website, and you can order those tests, you know, and you can see if you have the inflammation, you can see if you have the spike protein, but people who have a change in their health, you just assume that you have long COVID, right?
[01:22:22.657 --> 01:22:28.047]   If you're, if you're not, if you don't have as much, you know, energy as you're used to, you can't think straight, you
[01:22:28.047 --> 01:22:31.407]   know, you start forgetting words, you can't sleep well, you have anxiety. I mean there's so
[01:22:31.407 --> 01:22:31.457]  much...
[01:22:31.457 --> 01:22:36.177]   Oh that happened to my dad. I mean, he literally, for like at least two months,
[01:22:36.177 --> 01:22:40.658]   was really screwed up and now eight, nine months later he's almost back. But it's been,
[01:22:40.658 --> 01:22:44.097]   I've got him to take ivermectin again and other things and it's really helped him.
[01:22:44.097 --> 01:22:45.938]  And most people who have this don't realize they have it.
[01:22:46.148 --> 01:22:50.511]  They go to their doctor and the doctor just tells them you have anxiety, or you have insomnia, or they just name it.
[01:22:50.571 --> 01:22:53.693]  They name the problem, you know, but they don't tell you why.
[01:22:53.753 --> 01:22:54.533]  Well, that's in the news.
[01:22:54.613 --> 01:23:02.658]  Hypertension, depression, Alzheimer's is way up, neurological disorders, heart attacks, but it's all exploded.
[01:23:02.938 --> 01:23:03.618]  Yeah.
[01:23:03.798 --> 01:23:10.100]  And the point, the really important point I want to make is that it can be a silent killer and it can crop up later.
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:13.841]  So I've seen people who had asymptomatic COVID infections, okay?
[01:23:14.261 --> 01:23:16.461]  They didn't even have symptoms, end up with long COVID.
[01:23:16.602 --> 01:23:24.043]  And we're talking about at least 60% of people will have symptoms of long COVID that they see like in the next three to six months.
[01:23:24.484 --> 01:23:29.205]  But then the other 40% may also have that inflammation and it just might be silent and waiting to go off.
[01:23:29.245 --> 01:23:30.085]  It's like a time bomb.
[01:23:30.365 --> 01:23:32.986]  Well, Dr., answer this question for me, because that's so important.
[01:23:33.306 --> 01:23:43.469]  Three people that work here, I'm not going to get into more than that, they got it and were sick for two, three months, four months, with low oxygen, horrible effects that long.
[01:23:43.549 --> 01:23:44.089]  I mean, wow.
[01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:46.930]  That was Delta, obviously, that was going on there.
[01:23:47.050 --> 01:23:48.491]  And then, what's happening there?
[01:23:49.206 --> 01:23:50.986]  So we're seeing the same thing with Omicron.
[01:23:51.006 --> 01:23:55.627]  I got to tell people, you know, you're not seeing as much hospitalization and death, but I'm still seeing everything.
[01:23:55.647 --> 01:23:56.688]  I'm still seeing long COVID.
[01:23:56.988 --> 01:24:06.710]  I'm still seeing low oxygen levels in some people, you know, maybe it's half as much as we were seeing before Delta, but you know, twice as many people, at least maybe four, maybe 10 times as many people actually got it.
[01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:11.371]  So there's actually, you know, a lot of people who have serious problems with Omicron and what's going on.
[01:24:11.431 --> 01:24:12.611]  It's the spike protein, right?
[01:24:12.671 --> 01:24:15.252]  It's the spike protein in your body causing inflammation.
[01:24:15.271 --> 01:24:16.470]  That's exactly what it is.
[01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:17.872]  It's not just a replication of the virus.
[01:24:17.872 --> 01:24:20.570]  The virus coding itself is toxic.
[01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:25.431]   So yeah, so it's the spike protein that's toxic, but if you catch it on day one,
[01:24:25.431 --> 01:24:27.751]  you can stop the replication of the virus.
[01:24:27.751 --> 01:24:29.351]  Zap it before it ever gets going.
[01:24:29.351 --> 01:24:30.791]  So many different ways.
[01:24:30.791 --> 01:24:31.751]  You can use--
[01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:33.711]  My parents didn't tell me for a week they were sick.
[01:24:33.711 --> 01:24:34.951]  They were like almost dead when I got over it.
[01:24:34.951 --> 01:24:36.310]  And a lot of people do that, right?
[01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:39.751]   And so the important thing is that if you try to get these meds
[01:24:39.751 --> 01:24:42.951]   once you start feeling symptoms, or even once you're exposed,
[01:24:42.951 --> 01:24:47.072]   and think, okay, I have a few days to get the meds, sometimes it takes that long for the pharmacy
[01:24:47.072 --> 01:24:48.271]  to ship it in.
[01:24:48.271 --> 01:24:49.112]  Who knows?
[01:24:49.112 --> 01:24:52.711]   There might be something that happens that makes it so that you can't--
[01:24:52.711 --> 01:24:53.551]  I totally agree.
[01:24:53.551 --> 01:24:54.390]  People--
[01:24:54.705 --> 01:24:57.688]  People need this in their house more than they need a fire extinguisher.
[01:24:57.788 --> 01:25:01.271]  And I'm talking about, it's like supplemental health insurance, okay?
[01:25:01.891 --> 01:25:06.235]  And it costs a couple hundred bucks to insure yourself against disaster, right?
[01:25:06.956 --> 01:25:16.945]  And so I think it's well worth it to spend the money to buy the Ivermectin because you can't get, even if you have regular health insurance, the pharmacy at your local, you know, your local CVS or whatever is not going to give you the Ivermectin.
[01:25:17.145 --> 01:25:23.389]  No, I totally agree, and I've had a bunch of other doctors on and promoted this, and they've not paid me to do it.
[01:25:23.530 --> 01:25:28.313]  I've done it because listeners need this, it's great, but because you've got one of the best records out there and doing a great job.
[01:25:28.333 --> 01:25:36.719]  I mean, I've asked you down the road to become a sponsor with us to help support the broadcast, so it's symbiotic, but I'm telling you folks, these are great people.
[01:25:37.299 --> 01:25:42.322]  And they're getting ready to support the Infowar, and they are one of the fastest, quickest people to get back with you.
[01:25:42.703 --> 01:25:47.126]  You know, a few hours a day, you know, day and a half max, if it's the weekend, and it's high quality.
[01:25:47.166 --> 01:25:48.667]  And I think it's a no-brainer.
[01:25:48.987 --> 01:25:52.909]  Like, you need a firearm, and you need storable food, and you need a relationship with God.
[01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:58.473]  You need to have these things in your house for what's coming and what's going on in this society.
[01:25:58.533 --> 01:26:01.715]  I would go to mygoto.com right now.
[01:26:01.534 --> 01:26:18.814]  We'll be right back.
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:23.544]  Winter Sun is the highest quality organic vitamin D3 taken out of the tongue.
[01:26:23.584 --> 01:26:26.828]  It also has vitamin K, critical for your immune system and so much more.
[01:26:27.409 --> 01:26:32.113]  It's 50% off despite the fact it's going to sell out very, very quickly because everybody needs this.
[01:26:32.794 --> 01:26:34.515]  Old, young, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[01:26:34.635 --> 01:26:36.237]  You need what's in Winter Sun.
[01:26:36.277 --> 01:26:39.019]  And then we have BrainForce Ultra.
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:48.587]  Super fast acting, amazing clean, nootropic system that is a complement to BrainForce Plus and of course TurboForce.
[01:26:48.988 --> 01:26:50.329]  All three of these are different formulas.
[01:26:50.745 --> 01:26:55.926]  But all three of them take your mind and take your focus and clarity and alertness to the next level.
[01:26:56.426 --> 01:27:00.948]  It is 40% off at InfoWarsTore.com for a limited time.
[01:27:01.308 --> 01:27:02.488]  Thank you all for your support.
[01:27:02.848 --> 01:27:05.409]  If you haven't tried these products, you really need to because they are amazing.
[01:27:05.689 --> 01:27:06.869]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:12.111]  Syed Haider is our guest here in studio.
[01:27:13.651 --> 01:27:16.592]  He is a doctor who specializes in internal medicine.
[01:27:17.754 --> 01:27:25.259]  Treat over 35,000 patients, over 4,000 with active COVID infections, resulting in zero deaths and only five hospitalizations.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.202]  Over 30,000 were given ongoing preventative ivermectin.
[01:27:29.062 --> 01:27:35.227]  Of those who took ivermectin to prevent catching COVID, less than 10% returned with active COVID infections.
[01:27:35.647 --> 01:27:50.356]   With the breaking news that the USPS and FDA are colluding to withhold overseas ivermectin shipments to Americans, Dr. Hyder is working to Construct and counteract the crisis by sourcing the cheapest U.S.
[01:27:50.476 --> 01:27:52.077]  mail-order pharmacies in each state.
[01:27:52.437 --> 01:28:00.461]  This bold action will provide Americans with life-saving drugs before they get sick, so they are ready for treatment on day one of symptoms which is so critical.
[01:28:00.821 --> 01:28:03.682]  Mygotodoc.com.
[01:28:03.842 --> 01:28:05.443]  One word, or you can call 281-219-4222.
[01:28:08.564 --> 01:28:15.528]  7367, and I recommend that people up front stockpile this to protect themselves and their family.
[01:28:15.808 --> 01:28:19.250]  This is a no-brainer, like putting your seatbelt on.
[01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:23.593]  281-219-7367, my go-to doc.com.
[01:28:23.873 --> 01:28:25.994]  Some stations don't carry this short segment, but a lot do.
[01:28:26.394 --> 01:28:31.737]  Doc, you've got big stuff next segment, but what else do you want to tell folks about the virus and what's happening?
[01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:37.833]  Yeah, so one thing I want to tell people is what is different about my website, mygotodoc.com.
[01:28:37.873 --> 01:28:46.176]  And one other thing that you mentioned was that less than 10% of people got COVID when they were taking preventative ivermectin once or twice a week.
[01:28:46.617 --> 01:28:51.199]  It's actually less than 0.1%, so it's a really vanishingly small number.
[01:28:51.979 --> 01:28:56.761]  And I've given out like 35,000 prescriptions actually for preventative ivermectin at this point.
[01:28:58.542 --> 01:29:01.824]  Less than 35 people have come back to me saying that they got COVID.
[01:29:02.644 --> 01:29:03.845]  And then what makes us different, right?
[01:29:03.945 --> 01:29:08.647]  So you can come to us, you can register for free, you can do free medical chat visits, right?
[01:29:08.667 --> 01:29:10.908]  So you can ask all your questions for free.
[01:29:11.528 --> 01:29:18.652]  And that's really important because a lot of people go and get their meds and then they have questions a couple of weeks later and then they can't get in touch with the same doctor, they can't ask their questions, they have to pay again.
[01:29:19.532 --> 01:29:22.934]  So we charge for, if we write you a prescription, then there's a doctor's fee.
[01:29:23.534 --> 01:29:26.837]  And the important thing, like you said, we're sourcing the cheapest pharmacies.
[01:29:26.857 --> 01:29:30.119]  Some pharmacies, we've been told, are charging like $700 to $1,000.
[01:29:30.219 --> 01:29:35.704]  Oh, that happened to one of our crew who also lives in North Carolina during Delta.
[01:29:35.724 --> 01:29:39.587]  He, his girlfriend, and his children.
[01:29:40.973 --> 01:29:44.656]  They were trying to charge him $500 for an inhaler.
[01:29:44.676 --> 01:29:46.997]  They were trying to charge him $1,000 for Ivermectin.
[01:29:47.157 --> 01:29:49.199]  Yeah, so we really work with patients, right?
[01:29:49.299 --> 01:29:52.961]  So, the Ivermectin, every pharmacy we use is less than $150.
[01:29:53.041 --> 01:30:00.026]  It's usually like $80 to $150 for 14 days of double-dose Ivermectin, not just 5 days, which a lot of these pharmacies are giving you for $1,000.
[01:30:00.326 --> 01:30:03.748]  And then the inhaler, like, the inhaler can be from $250 to $500.
[01:30:05.249 --> 01:30:07.651]  We'll give you the ampoules that you can put into a nebulizer.
[01:30:07.691 --> 01:30:11.253]  So a nebulizer machine is like $30, maybe $15, $20 on Amazon.
[01:30:11.634 --> 01:30:12.675]  Get a nebulizer machine.
[01:30:13.155 --> 01:30:20.880]  If the inhaler is not covered by your insurance, get the ampoules instead that you put into the nebulizer machine, and that's much, much cheaper to do.
[01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:23.502]  And so we work hand-in-hand with people, with pharmacies.
[01:30:23.882 --> 01:30:28.761]   We'll use your local pharmacies for all the medications that we can use them for that they will fill.
[01:30:28.761 --> 01:30:34.561]   And then we'll use the mail order pharmacy for ivermectin, sometimes for hydroxychloroquine.
[01:30:34.561 --> 01:30:38.202]   Sometimes that's actually dispensed by the local pharmacies nowadays.
[01:30:38.202 --> 01:30:44.002]   So if you do have insurance, you can actually use your local pharmacy for a lot of the protocol,
[01:30:44.002 --> 01:30:47.002]   except for the ivermectin, because they just won't dispense it.
[01:30:47.002 --> 01:30:49.662]   And that's why we need to have a low-cost mail order pharmacy,
[01:30:49.662 --> 01:30:54.202]   because oftentimes the mail order pharmacies are compounding divermectin
[01:30:54.202 --> 01:30:56.042]  and they're not covered by insurance.
[01:30:55.599 --> 01:30:57.561]  So you want to minimize the costs and that's what we're trying to do.
[01:30:57.621 --> 01:31:01.225]  We're trying to help solve the problems that people are having who are coming to us.
[01:31:01.285 --> 01:31:03.608]  And the big one that you've been talking about is the time, right?
[01:31:03.948 --> 01:31:06.091]  So like we aim for less than 24-hour turnaround.
[01:31:07.212 --> 01:31:08.493]  And that's if you do everything, right?
[01:31:08.513 --> 01:31:14.139]  You've got to fill out the form, you've got to, you know, answer all the questions, you know, upload ID verification, stuff like that.
[01:31:14.859 --> 01:31:19.604]  If you do everything that we ask, then we can usually get you your prescription sent out within 24 hours.
[01:31:20.025 --> 01:31:24.309]  But then you've got to wait, you've got to go pay the pharmacy, the mail order pharmacy, you've got to wait for them to ship it.
[01:31:24.829 --> 01:31:27.012]  So you've got to do this before you get sick, okay?
[01:31:27.392 --> 01:31:27.712]  Don't wait.
[01:31:27.832 --> 01:31:29.714]  Dr. Syed Hyder, stay there!
[01:31:30.575 --> 01:31:33.978]  Because I talk fast, I know, but some stations don't care that first five minutes.
[01:31:34.358 --> 01:31:37.301]  Listeners don't mind hearing it again, because we're saving lives.
[01:31:37.881 --> 01:31:38.842]  This is important.
[01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:40.063]  This is a no-brainer.
[01:31:40.343 --> 01:31:45.548]  Long before I met this guy, I got an office full of Ivermectin, and I've literally saved like 15 people, okay?
[01:31:46.008 --> 01:31:47.730]  And Budesodine, you name it.
[01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:49.231]  We'll talk about it all when we come back.
[01:31:50.242 --> 01:32:09.913]  Dr. Syed Haider is in studio with us and we've gotten feedback from other doctors and listeners that of the online and telephone pharmacies and doctors, they've been one of the best groups out there getting back with people quick and putting them in contact with the supply chain that's got reasonable prices and ready to deliver it to people.
[01:32:09.953 --> 01:32:13.995]  So I'm sitting there a few weeks ago and I'm thinking, you know, my phones are ringing off the hook.
[01:32:15.299 --> 01:32:25.804]  With people who are wanting to be able to preventatively get ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, and so many other things that the system is trying to block, but studies now are showing are amazing.
[01:32:26.245 --> 01:32:28.066]  And so I'm like, who will I talk to?
[01:32:28.166 --> 01:32:33.028]  What's the best feedback we've gotten of a lot of these great groups and organizations we've had on to do this?
[01:32:33.288 --> 01:32:37.270]  And so, yeah, we're looking at these folks to be a sponsor because we want to bring you good folks.
[01:32:37.310 --> 01:32:51.356]   But really, just as a public service announcement here, we're making this announcement because You need to understand that I had crew that did call other online pharmacies where they would try to charge them $500 for the Budesodone inhaler that should cost $50.
[01:32:51.536 --> 01:32:57.698]  These places would try to charge $1,000 for Ivermectin that should have cost $50 to $100.
[01:32:57.998 --> 01:33:02.860]  Okay, we understand the supply chain's broke down, it costs more to get it, so some markup should be there.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.961]  They're putting you in contact with folks that don't do that.
[01:33:05.381 --> 01:33:13.306]   I couldn't imagine, because I'll sell stuff all day that's good for people, If I'm in the Sahara Desert, I'll be selling ice water or a parasol so you don't burn up an umbrella.
[01:33:13.907 --> 01:33:15.848]  But the point is, I'm happy to sell you stuff.
[01:33:16.089 --> 01:33:17.870]  I'm not going to sell you a boat with holes in it, though.
[01:33:18.130 --> 01:33:19.752]  I don't want the bad mojo back.
[01:33:20.212 --> 01:33:20.933]  Reap what you sow.
[01:33:21.573 --> 01:33:36.501]   And so I just cannot imagine the profiteering we've seen, not just by Big Pharma and the Rendesivir that eats your kidneys, as you know, and blocking the good treatments with all the studies coming out proving they're vindicated you and others, but trying to keep people from
[01:33:36.501 --> 01:33:41.221]   access to legal, known, safe super drugs like Ivermectin.
[01:33:41.221 --> 01:33:45.581]   So spend a few minutes telling folks how they contact you, what they should do, and how
[01:33:45.581 --> 01:33:46.981]  important this is, Doc.
[01:33:46.981 --> 01:33:50.581]   Yeah, so there's a couple of really important points to make today.
[01:33:50.566 --> 01:33:53.469]  And number one is the pandemic's not over, okay?
[01:33:53.909 --> 01:33:58.414]  The pandemic is going to continue to have, you know, bigger and bigger waves probably, actually.
[01:33:58.774 --> 01:34:03.934]   And this is because we started vaccinating in the middle of a pandemic with leaky vaccines
[01:34:03.934 --> 01:34:06.134]  that are driving the viral evolution, okay?
[01:34:06.134 --> 01:34:09.814]   And they're creating worse and worse variants that are more virulent, okay?
[01:34:09.814 --> 01:34:13.334]   And so what's happening on the ground with me and other doctors who are doing this,
[01:34:13.334 --> 01:34:16.293]   and I've been doing this for 15 months now, that's all I do, okay?
[01:34:16.293 --> 01:34:18.493]  So I'm an expert on COVID treatment.
[01:34:18.493 --> 01:34:22.414]   What we're seeing on the ground is that every variant gets harder and harder to treat,
[01:34:22.414 --> 01:34:23.934]  and it's causing long COVID.
[01:34:23.934 --> 01:34:25.653]  You know, no one's talking about long COVID.
[01:34:25.653 --> 01:34:27.293]  You gotta worry about long COVID.
[01:34:27.293 --> 01:34:28.534]  We're seeing it in children.
[01:34:28.534 --> 01:34:29.854]  We're seeing it in the middle-aged.
[01:34:29.854 --> 01:34:31.213]  We're seeing it in the elderly.
[01:34:31.213 --> 01:34:33.614]  Every age group is getting long COVID.
[01:34:33.614 --> 01:34:38.253]   Adults are getting it at like 40 to 60%, okay, after an infection.
[01:34:38.253 --> 01:34:39.953]  They'll have symptoms for months.
[01:34:39.953 --> 01:34:42.614]  It can be life-changing, very difficult to deal with.
[01:34:42.284 --> 01:34:47.043]   Children are getting it about half the rate, but they're still getting it, which is shocking.
[01:34:47.043 --> 01:34:53.005]   I've had 13 year olds, 16 year olds, unable to go to school, unable to do their homework,
[01:34:53.005 --> 01:34:55.203]  unable to go back to soccer practice.
[01:34:55.203 --> 01:34:59.204]   So this is a serious illness, and even if you don't have symptoms,
[01:34:59.204 --> 01:35:01.204]  it can strike you later.
[01:35:01.245 --> 01:35:02.807]  It's like a ticking time bomb, okay?
[01:35:03.047 --> 01:35:10.236]  If you get re-exposed to COVID, if you get exposed to somebody who's vaccinated, that can be enough to push you over the edge into long COVID or even a vaccine injury.
[01:35:10.276 --> 01:35:11.477]  They're very similar situations.
[01:35:12.138 --> 01:35:15.302]  Now, so the next thing is, okay, this is a problem.
[01:35:15.362 --> 01:35:16.504]  It's an ongoing problem.
[01:35:16.604 --> 01:35:17.305]  It's not over yet.
[01:35:18.145 --> 01:35:19.146]  What do you do about it, right?
[01:35:19.186 --> 01:35:23.669]  You've got to get your meds into your medicine cabinet before you have the symptoms, okay?
[01:35:23.689 --> 01:35:26.170]  And the reason is there's a handful of doctors like me who are doing this.
[01:35:26.490 --> 01:35:31.133]  There's not enough to go around to talk to every single patient the day they get symptoms, all right?
[01:35:32.013 --> 01:35:35.295]  And the ivermectin, you've got to mail in from mail order pharmacy, okay?
[01:35:35.335 --> 01:35:36.496]  We found the cheapest ones.
[01:35:37.817 --> 01:35:42.940]  And the reason that I'm talking about the price, you know, a lot of people have health insurance, but it doesn't cover ivermectin, okay?
[01:35:43.640 --> 01:35:44.801]  You can't get it from your local pharmacy.
[01:35:44.821 --> 01:35:47.943]  You've got to get it from a mail-order compounding pharmacy and the insurance doesn't cover it.
[01:35:48.083 --> 01:35:49.384]  So you've got to look for the cheapest source.
[01:35:49.864 --> 01:35:53.307]  And again, some pharmacies are charging a thousand bucks for ivermectin.
[01:35:53.407 --> 01:35:54.447]  Our pharmacies, we found them.
[01:35:54.487 --> 01:35:56.949]  We did a lot of legwork to look for these places.
[01:35:56.969 --> 01:35:57.649]  $150 or less.
[01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:59.150]  $80 to $150 most of them.
[01:36:00.091 --> 01:36:02.953]  And then the Budesonide, hydroxychloroquine, fluvoxamine.
[01:36:03.313 --> 01:36:05.174]  There's a lot of medications you need to have on hand.
[01:36:05.194 --> 01:36:06.895]  You need to take them all on day one.
[01:36:07.116 --> 01:36:09.017]  There's no way you're going to get the ivermectin on day one.
[01:36:09.677 --> 01:36:14.520]  If you start looking for the pharmacy and the doctor and getting the prescription the day that you get sick.
[01:36:14.780 --> 01:36:18.002]  So it's like you need band-aids in your medicine cabinet before you cut your finger.
[01:36:18.102 --> 01:36:21.504]  Yeah, and what this is, it's like supplemental health insurance, okay?
[01:36:21.524 --> 01:36:26.247]  Because your health insurance does not cover real treatment for COVID-19, alright?
[01:36:26.627 --> 01:36:33.571]  No health insurance in this country actually gets you what you need to get rid of COVID-19, long COVID, or a vaccine injury, okay?
[01:36:33.651 --> 01:36:36.213]  All these things can be treated with basically the same medications.
[01:36:36.973 --> 01:36:48.138]  And so spending a couple hundred bucks to get these medications into your medicine cabinet, you know, pay the doctor's fee, this is a tiny price to pay to prevent what can become a disaster.
[01:36:48.219 --> 01:36:49.099]  It's a no-brainer.
[01:36:49.719 --> 01:36:50.340]  Here's the problem.
[01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:55.502]  I had like 30 boxes of ivermectin, imidacin, and hydroxychloroquine.
[01:36:55.522 --> 01:36:59.204]  I already gave it away to all these people, and I'm basically down to a couple boxes for me.
[01:37:00.105 --> 01:37:04.210]  And I'm intending to now take a regimen just to make sure that I've been flushed out.
[01:37:04.230 --> 01:37:06.654]  Because I think these are totally safe, known things.
[01:37:06.754 --> 01:37:11.701]  Why shouldn't people take it not just as a preventative, how often could you take it as a preventative?
[01:37:12.422 --> 01:37:15.787]  Or how often to make sure you've already had COVID that you flushed it out?
[01:37:16.641 --> 01:37:19.582]  Yeah, and so you can take this basically indefinitely, right?
[01:37:19.602 --> 01:37:26.524]  You can take it to prevent catching COVID, and in my experience, like less than one in a thousand people who take it twice a week will catch COVID.
[01:37:26.904 --> 01:37:28.465]  It's extremely well tolerated.
[01:37:29.285 --> 01:37:30.105]  Twice a week, okay?
[01:37:30.426 --> 01:37:32.606]  It's like, it's safer than aspirin, safer than Tylenol.
[01:37:32.626 --> 01:37:34.327]  It's one of the safest drugs on the planet.
[01:37:34.807 --> 01:37:37.828]  You know, it's extremely benign and extremely powerful against COVID.
[01:37:38.188 --> 01:37:40.029]  You can take it, you know, when you get COVID.
[01:37:40.049 --> 01:37:48.273]  If you start on day one with ivermectin and the other medications in the protocol, in the comprehensive protocol, you'll be over with the infection and you won't get long COVID, right?
[01:37:48.553 --> 01:37:51.034]  You'll be done with it in a couple of days, maybe, maybe less.
[01:37:51.054 --> 01:37:55.035]  So all these people going out getting booster shots and stuff trying to protect themselves.
[01:37:55.495 --> 01:37:59.057]  No wonder Big Pharma doesn't want a cheap, known, documented super drug.
[01:37:59.837 --> 01:38:04.120]  What do you make of all the studies, doctor, that have now come out confirming what everybody saw anecdotally?
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:06.602]  There are so many now, major U.S.
[01:38:06.642 --> 01:38:11.426]  studies, German studies, Japanese studies, that Ivermectin is just a miracle drug.
[01:38:11.646 --> 01:38:17.390]  So we have hundreds of studies at this point around the world and meta-analyses of studies.
[01:38:17.410 --> 01:38:21.093]  We have very high-level evidence showing that Ivermectin works, and it works great.
[01:38:21.333 --> 01:38:22.334]  It's a tremendous drug.
[01:38:23.134 --> 01:38:25.035]  Now they're trying to manufacture studies, right?
[01:38:25.055 --> 01:38:36.661]  There was just one in JAMA and they're trying to say that ivermectin doesn't work and they're creating these studies where they start treatment late, they mix in early treatment with late treatment and then they try to show that ivermectin doesn't have an effect.
[01:38:36.941 --> 01:38:43.585]   The JAMA study, if you look into the details of it and you look at the data, It actually shows Ivermectin works way better than the vaccines, okay?
[01:38:43.646 --> 01:38:50.931]  And it nearly reached clinical significance than it would have if they had started treatment in the first few days instead of taking patients within the first seven days.
[01:38:51.312 --> 01:39:00.119]  So that just shows there are thousands of studies showing Ivermectin works and then there's actually over a thousand studies at this point showing how dangerous the vaccines are.
[01:39:00.499 --> 01:39:00.679]  Right?
[01:39:00.699 --> 01:39:01.360]  I just learned this.
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:08.624]  I mean, you go and do a search on vaccine injuries, vaccine side effects, over a thousand studies that you can find in PubMed showing the vaccine.
[01:39:08.644 --> 01:39:15.187]  And they've had to put inserts now, finally, saying it causes massive increases in blood clots, heart attacks, and myocarditis.
[01:39:15.207 --> 01:39:15.868]  They've had to admit that.
[01:39:16.508 --> 01:39:19.990]  Yeah, and that's just like the tip of the iceberg, okay?
[01:39:20.670 --> 01:39:23.531]  Vaccine injuries are probably the worst crime against humanity.
[01:39:24.031 --> 01:39:30.774]  And what's going to happen later, probably with further variants of this virus, is that ADE is going to become a bigger and bigger problem.
[01:39:31.074 --> 01:39:32.975]  There's going to become negative vaccine efficacy.
[01:39:33.395 --> 01:39:34.276]  Explain what ADE is.
[01:39:35.436 --> 01:39:38.700]  Yeah, so antibody-dependent enhancement of the disease.
[01:39:38.821 --> 01:39:44.327]  This is something that we knew about, you know, for decades when we tried to create coronavirus vaccines in animals.
[01:39:44.628 --> 01:40:00.562]   You gave them the shots and they died at much higher rates because the antibodies that they created actually What about making, because I've always heard epidemiologists and virologists say don't give people a vaccine during a pandemic because it'll cause super mutants because of the survival of the fittest and then they say that Delta came out of India because of their vaccine program.
[01:40:00.382 --> 01:40:21.101]  40% rise in deaths in 2021.
[01:40:21.075 --> 01:40:22.556]  In general, it's a huge issue.
[01:40:22.716 --> 01:40:24.697]  And none of the vaccinologists are talking about this.
[01:40:24.717 --> 01:40:26.758]  There's only one that I know of, Gert Vandenbosch.
[01:40:26.838 --> 01:40:28.759]  You know, he's worked at the WHO, I think.
[01:40:28.779 --> 01:40:30.820]  He's worked with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.781]  I mean, this is a top vaccinologist, okay?
[01:40:33.081 --> 01:40:34.321]  This is not just a nobody.
[01:40:34.641 --> 01:40:40.324]  And he's been warning since the beginning that vaccinating in the middle of a pandemic with, you know, it's important, it's a leaky vaccine.
[01:40:40.524 --> 01:40:42.125]  It's not actually a vaccine at all, right?
[01:40:42.145 --> 01:40:43.305]  It doesn't stop the spread.
[01:40:43.605 --> 01:40:44.786]  It doesn't stop the infection.
[01:40:44.926 --> 01:40:46.926]  It doesn't stop you from spreading it.
[01:40:46.926 --> 01:40:48.926]  It doesn't stop you from catching it.
[01:40:48.926 --> 01:40:50.926]  So, you know, it's not really a vaccine.
[01:40:50.926 --> 01:40:52.926]  It's more of a therapy, you know, if anything.
[01:40:52.926 --> 01:40:56.926]   And so, yes, he's been saying since the start that we're creating super variants
[01:40:56.926 --> 01:41:00.926]   and this may be why we have Delta and why we now have Omicron
[01:41:00.926 --> 01:41:02.926]  and why we're going to have another one.
[01:41:02.926 --> 01:41:04.926]  You know, why we have stealth Omicron.
[01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:05.739]  right now.
[01:41:05.939 --> 01:41:07.440]  Oh yeah, this thing's just getting started.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.062]  People need to get prepared now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:10.382 --> 01:41:13.684]  You need to go to MyGoToDoc.com and get ready.
[01:41:13.764 --> 01:41:15.225]  MyGoToDoc.com.
[01:41:15.245 --> 01:41:16.026]  Take action now.
[01:41:16.286 --> 01:41:18.928]  We'll be right back with a final segment with our guest and a special announcement.
[01:41:19.775 --> 01:41:21.997]  Dr. Saeed Haider is our guest in studio.
[01:41:22.037 --> 01:41:27.743]  He came here from Puerto Rico, and we really appreciate him and all the work he does at mygotodoc.com.
[01:41:28.224 --> 01:41:30.046]  I told him he doesn't need to fly all the way here to do this.
[01:41:30.086 --> 01:41:30.947]  We really appreciate him.
[01:41:30.967 --> 01:41:34.671]  He's going to come on Harrison Smith's show next week in the morning.
[01:41:34.991 --> 01:41:45.339]   He'll be on The War Room next week as well, but I got to tell you, we've had a bunch of other great online doctors and telemedicine people Uh, but with the best reviews we've gotten is from MyGoToDoc.com.
[01:41:45.679 --> 01:41:48.220]  They're not a sponsor yet, but this is the type of sponsor I want.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:53.762]  Uh, but I would have them on anyways, just because I want to promote people getting prepared and getting ready.
[01:41:53.822 --> 01:41:59.221]  my go to dot com or 281-219-7367.
[01:41:59.221 --> 01:42:00.342]  He's riding shotgun with us.
[01:42:00.342 --> 01:42:04.061]   He'll have some final comments in a moment, but I appreciate him on short notice popping
[01:42:04.061 --> 01:42:07.740]   in and I want to invite him back on the show tomorrow for 30 minutes to an hour.
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:12.101]  Royce White is a former professional NBA player.
[01:42:12.101 --> 01:42:15.181]  He's now a professional mixed martial artist.
[01:42:15.181 --> 01:42:19.902]   He's also the author and political activist and I think he's a great leader and just super
[01:42:19.902 --> 01:42:20.902]  smart.
[01:42:20.902 --> 01:42:25.422]   He's also spoken on issues such as mental health and the Uyghurs and the CCP, cryptocurrency,
[01:42:25.422 --> 01:42:27.061]  the Federal Reserve, gain of function and others.
[01:42:27.238 --> 01:42:31.040]  So he helped, really, years ago, start the awareness of the Uyghurs and got punished for that.
[01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:37.664]  That's the kind of leader we need, somebody that doesn't back down and stands up for everybody's rights, whether they be an agnostic, a Muslim, a Christian, it doesn't matter.
[01:42:38.425 --> 01:42:40.326]  RoyceWhite.Substack.com.
[01:42:40.646 --> 01:42:45.109]  He has got a big announcement for us, and this is very exciting.
[01:42:45.129 --> 01:42:47.511]  We're up there in his hometown, the Twin Cities.
[01:42:47.771 --> 01:42:48.952]  So thank you, sir, for popping in.
[01:42:50.922 --> 01:42:52.042]  Thanks for having me again, Alex.
[01:42:52.082 --> 01:42:53.563]  I appreciate it.
[01:42:53.583 --> 01:42:54.143]  Lay it on us.
[01:42:54.163 --> 01:42:54.763]  We're excited.
[01:42:56.423 --> 01:43:05.126]  Yeah, well, I'm running for Congress here in Minnesota's 5th Congressional District, which is now, that seat is in the possession of Ilhan Omar.
[01:43:06.306 --> 01:43:09.907]  And yeah, it's a decision that I didn't come by easy.
[01:43:10.387 --> 01:43:12.908]  I've been encouraged by many of the people around me.
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:20.064]  To step into the political arena and take this chance in a district that's been democratic for a long time, but the wind is at our back.
[01:43:20.284 --> 01:43:34.032]  I think people are starting to wake up to what's going on in this country, that we've been captured and held captive by our elites who have a very global agenda, a very blatant global agenda.
[01:43:35.330 --> 01:43:47.253]  I noticed you point out that the big issue of our time, people waking up to corporate governmental capture and that the real enemy isn't the Russians or the Chinese or anybody, it's corporations taking the world over.
[01:43:47.293 --> 01:43:51.574]  I know you've been a big critic of the Great Reset, and I think you've got a real chance at beating Ilhan Omar.
[01:43:51.614 --> 01:43:52.655]  How do people support you?
[01:43:52.675 --> 01:43:54.035]  This is a huge announcement.
[01:43:55.888 --> 01:43:57.930]  They can support me at RoyceWhite.us.
[01:43:58.491 --> 01:43:59.852]  That's our campaign website.
[01:44:00.473 --> 01:44:03.396]  There you can join, you can volunteer, you can donate money.
[01:44:04.077 --> 01:44:06.540]  And listen, you know, we're in a crisis in this country.
[01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:07.681]  It's a crisis of leadership.
[01:44:08.431 --> 01:44:18.563]  But we are in a spiritual war, an economic war, a political war, and most importantly, we're in a cultural war for the future of this country.
[01:44:20.205 --> 01:44:22.147]  Minnesota is near and dear to my heart.
[01:44:22.187 --> 01:44:23.248]  It's where I was born and raised.
[01:44:23.308 --> 01:44:27.193]  I have a deep affection for Minnesota and Minneapolis and the Twin Cities.
[01:44:28.703 --> 01:44:30.104]  Look, I'm in for the fight.
[01:44:30.445 --> 01:44:31.186]  I'm in for the fight.
[01:44:31.706 --> 01:44:34.349]  We have to push back on the momentum of globalism, right?
[01:44:34.389 --> 01:44:42.997]  Globalism, the arrogance of globalism is undermining the value of country and the grandiosity of our federal government is undermining the meaning of community.
[01:44:43.418 --> 01:44:51.728]   And these globalists They're behind Ilhan Omar, no matter how radical she talks about socialism and all of these different ideas.
[01:44:51.868 --> 01:45:00.198]  The bottom line is that corporate elites, the corporatocracy runs the Democratic Party, and they run a serious element of the GOP as well.
[01:45:00.478 --> 01:45:04.863]  And I'm here to kind of, you know, be a lightning rod and fight against both hands of the hydrant.
[01:45:05.535 --> 01:45:13.141]  Man, I would love to get you into Congress, but you can't lose, even if you lose, because imagine the debates.
[01:45:13.241 --> 01:45:14.922]  Imagine you up there.
[01:45:15.762 --> 01:45:17.624]  She's going to be really scared of you.
[01:45:17.644 --> 01:45:19.425]  Obviously, you're not a coward.
[01:45:19.545 --> 01:45:23.768]  You've got a lot of courage, but I hope you get some bodyguards because she is gangstered up.
[01:45:26.030 --> 01:45:26.910]  Yeah, well, I mean, look.
[01:45:29.033 --> 01:45:31.114]  The trajectory is clear, right?
[01:45:31.154 --> 01:45:32.235]  The alliance is clear.
[01:45:32.375 --> 01:45:42.580]  The trajectory is they want to go to a one-government, one-currency society, where the population is small enough for them to have any real threat of a populist revolt.
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:46:00.512]   And whether it's George Soros or Xi Jinping or Klaus Schwab or Mark Zuckerberg or any of these global elitists, They are fully committed to puppets like Ilhan Omar and making sure that people like me never have a real platform.
[01:46:00.552 --> 01:46:04.955]  So I'm very thankful that you've allowed me to come on the show and your audience has been supportive of me already.
[01:46:05.855 --> 01:46:08.437]  We had a great first two interviews and I'm happy to be back here.
[01:46:09.150 --> 01:46:09.691]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:09.871 --> 01:46:12.473]  And I told Joe to try to get you on the show.
[01:46:12.513 --> 01:46:13.674]  He's looking at that.
[01:46:14.495 --> 01:46:16.377]  So we really appreciate you.
[01:46:16.717 --> 01:46:19.439]  Join me again tomorrow or the next day, whenever you can.
[01:46:19.499 --> 01:46:20.040]  Royce White.
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.062]  RoyceWhite.Substack.com.
[01:46:22.102 --> 01:46:25.945]  And how do people find your congressional site and how the listeners share that site?
[01:46:26.325 --> 01:46:27.667]  Because you're a real contender.
[01:46:28.647 --> 01:46:31.030]  You've got the gravitas, the background, everything.
[01:46:31.930 --> 01:46:35.050]  How do people visit the site and get involved?
[01:46:35.050 --> 01:46:39.729]  RoyceWhite.us, again, that's RoyceWhite.us.
[01:46:39.729 --> 01:46:43.490]  And we're doing smash mouth populism, America first.
[01:46:43.490 --> 01:46:46.769]   We're gonna go and decouple ourselves from the dependency on China.
[01:46:46.769 --> 01:46:48.329]  We're gonna bring our manufacturing home.
[01:46:48.329 --> 01:46:50.570]  We're gonna address the immigration issue.
[01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:55.210]   And we're gonna address the education issue, how this corporatocracy is sort of trying to make people
[01:46:55.210 --> 01:47:01.609]   dumb, illiterate, philosophically bankrupt in order to preserve power, to preserve the status quo
[01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:06.009]  and keep the wealth constraint in the top 1% of 1%.
[01:47:06.009 --> 01:47:07.930]  But we're gonna do it in a good Christian way.
[01:47:07.930 --> 01:47:11.130]   And we're gonna do it in an American way, a real American way.
[01:47:11.130 --> 01:47:12.570]  Beautiful, all right, Royce.
[01:47:12.570 --> 01:47:15.930]  Join us as soon as you can, RoyceWhite.us.
[01:47:15.930 --> 01:47:17.289]  Wow, thank you, sir.
[01:47:17.289 --> 01:47:27.289]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:47:19.249 --> 01:47:21.530]  Running against Ilhan Omar in Minnesota.
[01:47:21.570 --> 01:47:21.970]  Beautiful.
[01:47:22.111 --> 01:47:22.491]  All right.
[01:47:23.351 --> 01:47:26.513]  In closing, Doc, we really appreciate you joining us.
[01:47:27.273 --> 01:47:33.677]  There's so many bad things happening in the world, but the good news is there's still enough freedom for good doctors and good researchers to get the truth out.
[01:47:33.717 --> 01:47:41.421]  And I don't think we can put a number on it, but do we have any idea how many people got saved because of therapeutics despite the system trying to block it?
[01:47:42.208 --> 01:47:50.817]  I mean, just in my practice, you know, there's 5,000 people, 300 of them, or 5,000 people who were treated and 300 of them would have ended up in the hospital.
[01:47:50.997 --> 01:47:52.539]  At least five of them would have died, right?
[01:47:52.619 --> 01:47:53.680]  And that's just my practice.
[01:47:54.341 --> 01:48:01.528]  You go around the world, you know, there's a lot of doctors doing this in India, you know, all over the place with these off-label drugs in the United States as well.
[01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:03.330]  The Indian news says they eradicated it.
[01:48:03.810 --> 01:48:05.092]  In Uttar Pradesh, they eradicated it.
[01:48:05.112 --> 01:48:05.852]  And how did they do that?
[01:48:05.952 --> 01:48:07.294]  That's exactly what I'm trying to do.
[01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:08.095]  I'm glad you brought it up.
[01:48:08.475 --> 01:48:10.017]  You know, they went door-to-door.
[01:48:10.037 --> 01:48:16.503]  They gave everyone in the largest state of India a box of ivermectin, you know, vitamin C, vitamin D. This stuff here is from India.
[01:48:16.523 --> 01:48:16.924]  That's what they do.
[01:48:16.944 --> 01:48:17.844]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:48:18.045 --> 01:48:20.167]  They went everywhere, you know, and they tried to cover this up.
[01:48:20.507 --> 01:48:22.870]  They tried to hide the fact that they gave everyone ivermectin.
[01:48:22.890 --> 01:48:24.251]  They wouldn't let out this information.
[01:48:24.291 --> 01:48:25.052]  It was like a secret.
[01:48:25.432 --> 01:48:30.517]  Somebody, you know, online went and talked to somebody in India and was like, what was in that packet that you got?
[01:48:30.537 --> 01:48:32.139]  And they found out, yes, it was ivermectin.
[01:48:32.179 --> 01:48:34.662]  We bought cases of this from India to give out to friends and family.
[01:48:34.722 --> 01:48:35.222]  Works great.
[01:48:35.683 --> 01:48:36.764]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:48:37.084 --> 01:48:41.048]  The problem with this is, like you were saying before, the USPS is sometimes stopping the shipments.
[01:48:41.389 --> 01:48:42.650]  It takes two to three weeks to get there.
[01:48:42.850 --> 01:48:43.110]  I don't know.
[01:48:43.130 --> 01:48:44.711]  We had to order three times until we got it.
[01:48:45.012 --> 01:48:45.892]  And then we only got part of it.
[01:48:46.573 --> 01:48:51.796]  And sometimes it's actually more expensive than just even paying my doctor's fee and paying my pharmacy.
[01:48:51.816 --> 01:48:52.837]  Oh no, we pay more than we get from you.
[01:48:53.157 --> 01:48:53.578]  Exactly.
[01:48:53.598 --> 01:48:54.158]  Right?
[01:48:54.278 --> 01:48:57.120]  So the cost of the Indian stuff is actually higher.
[01:48:57.180 --> 01:48:58.241]  It takes a lot longer to get here.
[01:48:58.301 --> 01:48:59.562]  Sometimes it's seized at the border.
[01:49:00.183 --> 01:49:01.604]  But my point is they eradicated it.
[01:49:02.284 --> 01:49:02.805]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:49:02.825 --> 01:49:04.647]  What, one state at two hundred and something million people?
[01:49:04.727 --> 01:49:06.028]  Yeah, Uttar Pradesh.
[01:49:06.268 --> 01:49:07.810]  And so that's the way to do it.
[01:49:07.970 --> 01:49:12.475]  You can't wait until these people get sick and then try to have them connect to a doctor who doesn't know how to do the protocols.
[01:49:12.535 --> 01:49:13.997]  So the innocent are right, just hand it out.
[01:49:14.037 --> 01:49:15.339]  Exactly, that's what we're trying to do.
[01:49:15.679 --> 01:49:17.301]  We're trying to one-up them actually, right?
[01:49:17.401 --> 01:49:23.548]  So we're also going to keep you in contact online with me and my team so if you have questions in the future you can ask them as much as you want.
[01:49:24.048 --> 01:49:24.268]  Right?
[01:49:24.408 --> 01:49:28.669]  But you should get the directions, you should get the medicine in your medicine cabinet, and you should be ready to go.
[01:49:29.089 --> 01:49:33.430]  And like Royce White was saying, you know, they're coming after our guns, they're coming after our meds, right?
[01:49:33.490 --> 01:49:35.371]  They don't want us to have stuff to be able to treat ourselves.
[01:49:35.391 --> 01:49:36.631]  Our communications, everything.
[01:49:36.851 --> 01:49:40.092]  Dr. Heider, mygotodoc.com or 281-219-7367.
[01:49:40.152 --> 01:49:43.132]  Come visit us again.
[01:49:43.172 --> 01:49:43.552]  We love you.
[01:49:43.752 --> 01:49:44.172]  Absolutely.
[01:49:44.212 --> 01:49:45.613]  Doing a great job saving a lot of people.
[01:49:46.573 --> 01:49:49.194]  Well, Wayne Allen Root is going to host the fourth hour today.
[01:49:49.214 --> 01:49:50.874]  He doesn't need any introduction.
[01:49:51.949 --> 01:49:58.553]  He's been a big national TV host, syndicated radio host, best-selling author, and he's also been taking Trump in a loving way to the woodshed.
[01:49:58.593 --> 01:50:02.895]  I can tell you behind the scenes, I'm going to leave it at that, Trump actually listened to him.
[01:50:02.975 --> 01:50:10.099]  I've learned directly from folks at Mar-a-Lago that Trump talked to him and another Congresswoman who was here recently.
[01:50:10.659 --> 01:50:15.161]  I'm not supposed to tell you the details, but he finally is stopping the pushing of it, at least for now.
[01:50:15.221 --> 01:50:17.803]  He means well, but just amazing information.
[01:50:19.119 --> 01:50:23.806]  Rootforamerica.com's got his new book out as well about how to have real activism and actually take the country back.
[01:50:24.367 --> 01:50:25.930]  But Wayne, great to have you here with us.
[01:50:25.950 --> 01:50:29.735]  I know you're going to be hosting a lot of stuff and covering things in the fourth hour today, but...
[01:50:30.856 --> 01:50:32.656]  Big picture, what do you make of Russia?
[01:50:32.676 --> 01:50:34.317]  I know you've been on top of that.
[01:50:34.997 --> 01:50:40.158]  What do you make of Trudeau and the martial law and honking a horn means Heil Hitler now?
[01:50:40.178 --> 01:50:43.219]  I mean, it's just over the left.
[01:50:43.659 --> 01:50:47.920]  Every time you think they can't go more insane, in spinal tap, they go, why not just have it go to 10?
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:48.580]  Well, it's 11.
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:49.640]  Well, they go to 12, 13, 20, 1,000.
[01:50:51.620 --> 01:50:53.101]  They just keep turning it up.
[01:50:53.361 --> 01:50:53.961]  Where does this go?
[01:50:56.213 --> 01:50:58.675]  It's a scary thing, Alex, and nobody knows where it's going to end.
[01:50:58.715 --> 01:50:59.816]  They don't know where it's going to end.
[01:50:59.856 --> 01:51:00.277]  We don't know.
[01:51:00.317 --> 01:51:00.757]  They don't know.
[01:51:00.777 --> 01:51:02.819]  The question is, can we stop it?
[01:51:03.219 --> 01:51:05.442]  I didn't know where the Canadian convoy would go.
[01:51:05.462 --> 01:51:08.124]  I had no idea they'd actually blockade Ottawa.
[01:51:08.545 --> 01:51:10.406]  I had no idea it would last for three weeks.
[01:51:10.827 --> 01:51:22.536]   I had no idea the incredible success ...that they have with that blockade, which brought down so many COVID regulations in every province in Canada, and then at the same time... Enforce Dictator Trudeau out in the open!
[01:51:22.556 --> 01:51:23.277]  The polls are out!
[01:51:23.837 --> 01:51:25.579]  His party has destroyed themselves!
[01:51:26.806 --> 01:51:30.549]  Right, well, so America's party's destroyed itself, the Democrat party as well.
[01:51:30.989 --> 01:51:34.792]  But the question is, do you win if elections are rigged?
[01:51:35.253 --> 01:51:36.093]  Does it matter?
[01:51:36.133 --> 01:51:41.097]  Because they know now that if you fix the election, you could have zero percent.
[01:51:41.377 --> 01:51:42.598]  The people could hate you.
[01:51:42.959 --> 01:51:55.989]  But if you put millions of mail-in ballots and they all come in in the hours after you've already seen what the totals are, you know, like Pennsylvania, you know, not to switch to voter fraud, but I have to make this point.
[01:51:56.109 --> 01:51:57.469]  Oh no, that's been proven now.
[01:51:57.570 --> 01:51:58.990]  You've been writing about that.
[01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:05.392]  So Trump was up by 800,000 votes on election night, and it was unbeatable.
[01:52:05.452 --> 01:52:06.553]  Trump won Pennsylvania.
[01:52:07.053 --> 01:52:22.778]  Meanwhile, the week before, the Attorney General of Pennsylvania, I believe his last name is Shapiro, he made a comment the week before, it doesn't matter what you think, doesn't matter how big Trump wins, doesn't matter how big the lead is at election night, Trump's not going to win Pennsylvania.
[01:52:23.278 --> 01:52:25.280]  And I thought, this guy's crazy!
[01:52:25.340 --> 01:52:25.920]  I was naive.
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:27.121]  I didn't think he knew.
[01:52:27.141 --> 01:52:32.465]  He knew that no matter what the lead was, they would beat it with fake ballots.
[01:52:32.905 --> 01:52:42.452]  So they saw that they had to beat 800,000, and they set out over the next six days to write out... Well, remember, Pelosi and all them, I'm going to make a documentary about this, because they said no matter what he does, he's out.
[01:52:43.193 --> 01:52:46.716]  It'll be a red mirage, but we'll have the vote, the mail-ins, we're going to win.
[01:52:46.896 --> 01:52:48.457]  They even telegraphed for their own people!
[01:52:49.753 --> 01:52:49.993]  Right.
[01:52:50.393 --> 01:52:54.174]  And so, you know, I think that nothing in the world is more important now.
[01:52:54.514 --> 01:52:59.275]  We could discuss Afghanistan and leaving the weapons on the ground and leaving the Americans behind.
[01:52:59.535 --> 01:53:00.976]  We could discuss the open borders.
[01:53:01.276 --> 01:53:03.056]  We can discuss what's happening in Ukraine.
[01:53:03.456 --> 01:53:04.097]  All of it.
[01:53:04.137 --> 01:53:07.677]  None of it matters if we don't have free and fair elections in 258 days.
[01:53:08.778 --> 01:53:11.578]  None of it matters, as Stalin says, if you're not the one counting the votes.
[01:53:11.938 --> 01:53:12.819]  Doesn't matter who's voting.
[01:53:13.179 --> 01:53:14.519]  Matters who counts the votes.
[01:53:14.799 --> 01:53:15.959]  That's what Stalin said.
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:19.173]   And these are Stalin-esque Communists.
[01:53:20.033 --> 01:53:26.174]  And by the way, if you don't believe Biden's a communist and a Stalin-esque Soviet-style communist, what is Justin Trudeau?
[01:53:26.194 --> 01:53:28.495]  I mean, he has unmasked himself.
[01:53:29.195 --> 01:53:37.496]  The blackface man has unmasked himself as a true Stalin-esque communist who has got his people under his jackboots.
[01:53:37.896 --> 01:53:39.297]  The country of Canada is done.
[01:53:39.757 --> 01:53:40.097]  Finished.
[01:53:40.157 --> 01:53:40.877]  I totally agree.
[01:53:40.897 --> 01:53:41.857]  And what do you make of him?
[01:53:41.897 --> 01:53:50.399]   Because I'm not lionizing Putin, but him saying we're going to fight Putin's authoritarianism When Trudeau says he wants to be a dictator.
[01:53:51.713 --> 01:53:59.795]  Yeah, it's almost as funny that he says that as when a Biden spokesman, I've seen America spokesman, but Biden does represent America.
[01:53:59.835 --> 01:54:00.635]  You and I both know that.
[01:54:00.995 --> 01:54:06.757]  Biden spokesman said, this is about, you know, the sovereignty and the borders of Ukraine.
[01:54:07.057 --> 01:54:08.877]  And I'm sitting here going, wait a minute.
[01:54:09.137 --> 01:54:10.658]  What about the American border?
[01:54:10.698 --> 01:54:11.718]  Are you out of your mind?
[01:54:11.798 --> 01:54:12.058]  Exactly.
[01:54:12.078 --> 01:54:13.558]  You're worried about Ukraine's border?
[01:54:13.898 --> 01:54:15.159]  So it's the same kind of statement.
[01:54:15.179 --> 01:54:16.079]  So what do you expect to come out of that?
[01:54:16.099 --> 01:54:26.734]   I want to go back to voting, but what are people going to do when almost 80% of Americans Or actually more, do not want to be at war with Russia and all this is happening.
[01:54:26.934 --> 01:54:27.876]  Where do you think this goes now?
[01:54:29.204 --> 01:54:30.885]  Yeah, let me give you a personal first.
[01:54:31.005 --> 01:54:32.325]  I have two young sons, right?
[01:54:32.425 --> 01:54:37.887]  One is 21, actually just turned 22, and the other is 17, about to turn 18.
[01:54:38.347 --> 01:54:40.368]  I'm not giving up my boys to fight in Ukraine.
[01:54:40.828 --> 01:54:43.209]  My sons, I'm not sending them to Ukraine to die.
[01:54:43.569 --> 01:54:45.470]  I learned my lesson from Vietnam.
[01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:50.452]  I have no interest in going to a country that does not matter to the United States of America.
[01:54:51.112 --> 01:54:54.074]  Our country, as I think Tucker said last night, who's opening your borders?
[01:54:54.134 --> 01:54:55.295]  Who's devaluing your currency?
[01:54:55.676 --> 01:54:57.637]  Who's treating sexualization of our children?
[01:54:58.038 --> 01:55:00.720]  Who is causing culture war?
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:02.641]  Who is creating inflation?
[01:55:02.721 --> 01:55:03.562]  It's the Democrats.
[01:55:03.862 --> 01:55:04.543]  It's not Putin.
[01:55:04.743 --> 01:55:05.624]  The fight is here.
[01:55:06.949 --> 01:55:08.650]  Right, and the fight is critical race theory.
[01:55:08.950 --> 01:55:11.951]  By the way, you know what Virginia proved with Yunkin, Alex?
[01:55:12.331 --> 01:55:21.495]  That's the number one issue for Republicans, even though I think vaccine mandates and I think that open borders are the two issues that matter above all else.
[01:55:21.975 --> 01:55:26.637]  To the average woman in America, we already have almost all men are Republicans.
[01:55:27.157 --> 01:55:28.417]  Women are the issue.
[01:55:28.457 --> 01:55:30.178]  We've got to get them over to our side.
[01:55:30.418 --> 01:55:34.880]  No, I agree, and women teaching a five-year-old they're bad because of what color they are is evil.
[01:55:35.672 --> 01:55:36.612]  Right, right.
[01:55:36.693 --> 01:55:43.436]  So we turned all the mama bears into Republicans in Virginia and in San Francisco a couple weeks ago.
[01:55:43.836 --> 01:55:59.403]  They threw three liberals out of office in a completely liberal district out of school board because they had kept their kids out of school and they wanted vaccine mandates and they wanted mask mandates and they wanted to change the names of every school with wonderful names.
[01:55:59.763 --> 01:56:02.064]  George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, that's no good anymore.
[01:56:02.424 --> 01:56:08.370]  And they threw them out, and it was not like 51-49, it was 75% of the vote in a liberal district.
[01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:11.053]  Exactly, so I was going to bring that up.
[01:56:11.113 --> 01:56:17.880]  So why is the left so obsessed with literally Hitler stuff in reverse that no one's going to buy?
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:21.464]  I mean, no one's going to buy telling five-year-olds they're inherently black because of what color they are.
[01:56:22.688 --> 01:56:22.908]  Right.
[01:56:23.229 --> 01:56:25.451]  I mean, the only answer I can give you, Alex, is a couple.
[01:56:25.832 --> 01:56:27.233]  Number one, they are mentally ill.
[01:56:27.614 --> 01:56:29.536]  And this was, remember Michael Savage?
[01:56:29.916 --> 01:56:32.619]  He wrote a book 30 years ago, Liberalism is a Mental Illness.
[01:56:32.679 --> 01:56:33.000]  It is.
[01:56:33.140 --> 01:56:34.802]  And he was so right.
[01:56:35.322 --> 01:56:36.984]  So right, and he was so ahead of his time.
[01:56:37.004 --> 01:56:38.426]  It was like Michael Savage.
[01:56:38.486 --> 01:56:39.587]  It is a mental disorder.
[01:56:39.948 --> 01:56:41.670]  I mean, who would even come up with stuff like this?
[01:56:42.010 --> 01:56:42.891]  So what's wrong with him?
[01:56:42.951 --> 01:56:43.392]  What happens?
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:47.843]  Who would ever teach boys that they should be girls and girls they should be boys?
[01:56:48.184 --> 01:56:50.646]  And don't tell your parents, but you should have a sex change.
[01:56:50.987 --> 01:56:54.530]  Who would even think of something so mentally disturbing?
[01:56:54.851 --> 01:57:01.257]  They're just weird people, and they're trying to convince us that the weirder you are, that's America.
[01:57:01.578 --> 01:57:08.404]   And the normal people, especially white, straight males who actually like women, Yeah, they do actually teach that.
[01:57:08.264 --> 01:57:14.264]   and we're bad. Everyone's normal is bad to a liberal and everybody bad is
[01:57:14.264 --> 01:57:18.264]   supposed to be the norm. So they're trying to teach the kids you don't want
[01:57:18.264 --> 01:57:23.503]   to be a white straight male. If you are, you're a bad person, you're evil, you're
[01:57:23.503 --> 01:57:26.864]   responsible for everything bad that's ever happened in the world.
[01:57:26.864 --> 01:57:29.264]  They do actually teach that. It's outrageous.
[01:57:29.264 --> 01:57:32.462]  They do.
[01:57:30.909 --> 01:57:33.411]  And they're trying to switch men to women and women to men.
[01:57:33.811 --> 01:57:34.912]  And it's just sick.
[01:57:34.992 --> 01:57:36.814]  But look, I think they're mentally ill.
[01:57:36.894 --> 01:57:40.717]  And I think they realize these are the things they really believe in, Alex.
[01:57:40.757 --> 01:57:42.618]  They really do believe in these things.
[01:57:42.978 --> 01:57:49.123]  And so the only way to impose them, they'll never win a popularity contest or a vote or a poll.
[01:57:49.544 --> 01:57:59.710]   So the only way to impose them Is to rig and steal elections and to ban and censor and burn the books of your opponents and not let the rest of us speak.
[01:58:00.110 --> 01:58:03.552]  And that way they can convince themselves and convince... Well, that's right.
[01:58:03.592 --> 01:58:04.713]  They've lost the arguments.
[01:58:04.813 --> 01:58:08.455]  The question is, can they successfully now bring in a tyranny worldwide?
[01:58:08.495 --> 01:58:17.860]  I'm sure you saw in Canada, hundreds of people charged, not given bail, including peaceful organizers for peaceful protesting, facing 10 years in jail up to a year till trial.
[01:58:18.140 --> 01:58:19.521]  That's North Korea stuff.
[01:58:20.726 --> 01:58:21.946]  Right, that's January 6th.
[01:58:22.047 --> 01:58:23.287]  It's not North Korea, it's America.
[01:58:23.307 --> 01:58:23.667]  You're right.
[01:58:23.747 --> 01:58:25.168]  Canada's gone full America.
[01:58:25.468 --> 01:58:34.951]  And remember, Justin Trudeau, who's a little wimpy snowflake, I won't say more on national TV, but I have a real word for him, but I'm not going to say it, because you and I would both get taken off the air.
[01:58:35.311 --> 01:58:37.292]  So Justin Trudeau is a wimpy snowflake.
[01:58:37.812 --> 01:58:39.954]  And he was actually, he didn't know what to do.
[01:58:39.994 --> 01:58:42.876]  He ran and he hid from the convoy and the blockade.
[01:58:43.216 --> 01:58:44.737]  He was scared of those truckers.
[01:58:45.257 --> 01:58:47.459]  And then he got a phone call from Joe Biden.
[01:58:47.919 --> 01:58:54.263]  And right after the phone call is when he imposed the Emergency Powers Act and basically martial law.
[01:58:54.563 --> 01:58:57.565]  And that's when he started arresting and beating everybody.
[01:58:57.866 --> 01:59:03.609]  And now he's decided to charge them the exact same way that we charged people in January 6th.
[01:59:04.670 --> 01:59:05.710]  No, you make a great point.
[01:59:05.771 --> 01:59:07.031]  I say it's like North Korea.
[01:59:07.411 --> 01:59:12.554]  January 6th and the tyranny and the no bail for a peaceful people is an example of the world.
[01:59:13.034 --> 01:59:16.215]  Oh, America puts people in jail without trial.
[01:59:16.235 --> 01:59:17.376]  We need to do that too.
[01:59:17.416 --> 01:59:17.856]  You're right.
[01:59:18.536 --> 01:59:21.238]  Exported from America to Canada, the January 6th tyranny.
[01:59:22.358 --> 01:59:24.899]  All right, he's about to take over and host the fourth hour.
[01:59:24.939 --> 01:59:26.260]  He's an amazing talk show host.
[01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:27.781]  Everybody knows him.
[01:59:28.501 --> 01:59:30.462]  Wayne Allen Root, RootForAmerica.com.
[01:59:32.725 --> 01:59:39.511]  Look at some of these articles that are on InfoWars.com though, because I'm definitely going to shoot some special reports today, because I didn't get to have this.
[01:59:40.432 --> 01:59:42.534]  Sticker Shock, this is linked up on Drugs Report.
[01:59:43.855 --> 01:59:48.299]  Gas climbs over $6 per gallon in Los Angeles.
[01:59:48.320 --> 01:59:49.741]  That's in a Don Salazar article.
[01:59:50.802 --> 01:59:55.626]  That is almost, that's a 150% increase in the last 12 months, 13 months.
[01:59:56.447 --> 02:00:01.546]   And we've got the head of the Energy Department saying, Well, this is part of the transition.
[02:00:01.606 --> 02:00:02.566]  Transition to what?
[02:00:04.026 --> 02:00:05.947]  Unbelievable.
[02:00:06.647 --> 02:00:07.407]  Then we've got this.
[02:00:07.467 --> 02:00:12.609]  CDC is refusing to publish data it has collected on booster effectiveness 18 to 49.
[02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:15.590]  I mean, case closed when they're hiding data.
[02:00:16.590 --> 02:00:20.311]  Wayne, my problem as a talk show host, and I'm sure you have the same ones, there's too much to talk about.
[02:00:20.551 --> 02:00:21.892]  There's never a slow news day.
[02:00:21.932 --> 02:00:22.672]  This is crazy.
[02:00:23.871 --> 02:00:38.127]  Yeah, I'll put a stack together for every show of my three-hour national radio show, Alex, and the stack is this thick and it's got like a hundred articles that I took an hour to download that I'm interested in all hundred of them and at the end of three hours I've spoken about three to five.
[02:00:38.267 --> 02:00:38.648]  Exactly.
[02:00:39.768 --> 02:00:50.010]  95 are ignored, and they're all important, and it's very scary if you're in that 95 pile, because tomorrow I'll have a new 100, and the 95 gets thrown out in the recycling bin.
[02:00:50.290 --> 02:00:51.431]  Hey, I'm liberal about one thing.
[02:00:51.651 --> 02:00:52.671]  I've got a recycling bin.
[02:00:53.731 --> 02:00:54.351]  I'm like you.
[02:00:54.371 --> 02:00:56.111]  I print it, because they change articles.
[02:00:56.152 --> 02:00:56.972]  You can't skip around.
[02:00:57.072 --> 02:00:59.112]  I print all of it, and exactly.
[02:00:59.232 --> 02:01:03.173]  I covered 10%, and it's crazy what's going on.
[02:01:04.529 --> 02:01:05.270]  And you know what's funny?
[02:01:05.310 --> 02:01:14.316]  Inflation reminds me of everything else that liberals do to us, or I should say socialists, Marxists, and communists do to us, who are hiding as liberals.
[02:01:15.036 --> 02:01:16.557]  But they do the same thing.
[02:01:17.018 --> 02:01:24.222]  Everything they do destroys the middle class, and destroys small business, and makes America into Mexico, or some other country.
[02:01:24.262 --> 02:01:26.504]  Oh, they admit they want dependent, pathetic people.
[02:01:27.688 --> 02:01:27.868]  Right.
[02:01:28.088 --> 02:01:37.036]  They want a little group of super-rich elitists at the top that have all the government contracts, and their wives and husbands are politicians and billionaire businessmen and women.
[02:01:37.436 --> 02:01:39.958]  And then almost everybody is poor.
[02:01:40.238 --> 02:01:41.479]  The rest of the country is poor.
[02:01:41.779 --> 02:01:43.041]  They've eliminated the middle.
[02:01:43.421 --> 02:01:50.687]  And when you see, you mentioned gas prices are $6 in Los Angeles, and soon they're going to be $7 in Los Angeles, what experts say.
[02:01:50.707 --> 02:01:51.007]  Yeah, they're $6.21, $6.23.
[02:01:51.147 --> 02:01:51.988]  I mean, that is insane.
[02:01:55.413 --> 02:01:57.153]  Insane, and it doesn't hurt rich people.
[02:01:57.474 --> 02:02:00.734]  A rich person couldn't care less about a $6 gallon gas.
[02:02:01.014 --> 02:02:04.075]  Matter of fact, most rich people work at home, so they're not even driving.
[02:02:04.455 --> 02:02:08.476]  And even if they did, what's $6 gas when you have $10 million in the bank?
[02:02:08.776 --> 02:02:09.336]  Doesn't matter.
[02:02:09.356 --> 02:02:10.297]  So the rich are fine.
[02:02:10.717 --> 02:02:11.877]  Now let's talk about the poor.
[02:02:12.277 --> 02:02:13.137]  The poor are fine.
[02:02:13.357 --> 02:02:16.478]  They get welfare and food stamps and housing allowance.
[02:02:16.498 --> 02:02:18.618]  It's the working man and woman that's screwed by this.
[02:02:18.719 --> 02:02:23.027]   Why does Klaus Schwab openly say Klaus Schwab says they want to get rid of the middle class.
[02:02:23.348 --> 02:02:24.793]  What threatens them about that?
[02:02:24.833 --> 02:02:27.080]  Well, it's an upwardly mobile group they don't control.
[02:02:28.351 --> 02:02:29.871]  Let me give you one more.
[02:02:29.932 --> 02:02:31.092]  My dad was a butcher.
[02:02:31.392 --> 02:02:33.593]  You know, I always joke that I'm an SOB, a son of a butcher.
[02:02:33.973 --> 02:02:39.775]  And my dad was a butcher who spent 20 years working in a butcher store carving meat.
[02:02:40.095 --> 02:02:41.295]  What a miserable life, right?
[02:02:41.815 --> 02:02:44.376]  And by the way, I'm not being judgmental or elitist.
[02:02:44.776 --> 02:02:47.377]  He every day said, Wayne, this is miserable.
[02:02:47.677 --> 02:02:48.777]  I want you to go to college.
[02:02:49.097 --> 02:02:49.878]  You can't do this.
[02:02:50.158 --> 02:02:51.018]  This is misery.
[02:02:51.278 --> 02:02:51.818]  He hated it.
[02:02:52.198 --> 02:02:57.320]  But after 20 years of doing it, he saved up enough money to start his own butcher store.
[02:02:57.780 --> 02:03:01.282]  Now, he had a little two-man butcher store with him and my uncle.
[02:03:01.722 --> 02:03:16.529]  And just with a crappy two-man butcher store, he made enough money to suddenly buy us a nice house, and go out to eat once or twice a week, and a nice new car every two years, and he paid for me to go to Columbia University, and my sister to go to Columbia University.
[02:03:16.830 --> 02:03:18.430]  Two kids went to Ivy League school.
[02:03:18.630 --> 02:03:20.011]  That's what they want to destroy.
[02:03:20.051 --> 02:03:21.552]  They want to destroy that ladder up.
[02:03:22.478 --> 02:03:22.938]  That's it.
[02:03:23.218 --> 02:03:24.259]  That's what they can't stand.
[02:03:24.499 --> 02:03:27.940]  And what they can't stand about it is he was very independent.
[02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:31.301]  All small business owners have a message for government.
[02:03:31.601 --> 02:03:32.641]  Go screw yourself.
[02:03:32.921 --> 02:03:33.681]  We don't need you.
[02:03:33.962 --> 02:03:34.742]  We don't want you.
[02:03:34.962 --> 02:03:36.082]  We just want you out of the way.
[02:03:36.442 --> 02:03:37.503]  We don't need any help from you.
[02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:38.843]  We want nothing from you.
[02:03:39.103 --> 02:03:41.584]  That's how every small businessman and woman thinks.
[02:03:41.864 --> 02:03:43.244]  We're independent thinkers.
[02:03:43.264 --> 02:03:48.546]  Well, yeah, because you don't even want your husband and wife looking over your shoulder or your cousin or your neighbor, much less the government.
[02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.930]  Right.
[02:03:50.190 --> 02:03:50.951]  And that's what they hate.
[02:03:51.011 --> 02:03:51.691]  They can't stand it.
[02:03:52.011 --> 02:03:57.774]  We're the ones standing in the way of America becoming communist or Nazi or whatever it is you want to call it.
[02:03:58.094 --> 02:04:01.276]  Stalin-esque or fascist or authoritarian.
[02:04:01.556 --> 02:04:02.856]  It doesn't matter what the word is.
[02:04:03.156 --> 02:04:04.097]  They're all the same.
[02:04:04.457 --> 02:04:07.719]  As a matter of fact, liberals have lied for all these years now, 80 years.
[02:04:08.659 --> 02:04:12.521]  They claim that Nazi was conservative and Hitler was conservative.
[02:04:12.841 --> 02:04:13.482]  No, he wasn't.
[02:04:13.702 --> 02:04:15.683]  He was the Socialist Party of Germany.
[02:04:15.983 --> 02:04:17.224]  He was a socialist.
[02:04:17.484 --> 02:04:19.945]  There was nothing conservative about Adolf Hitler.
[02:04:20.146 --> 02:04:22.167]  He was a fascist and a socialist.
[02:04:22.487 --> 02:04:34.954]  And these people in office in Canada and America, the Democrat Party here, the Labour Party in almost every democracy, UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, they're all the same.
[02:04:35.454 --> 02:04:43.217]  And let me add to that though, we can laugh at it and I laugh at it too, but when they're teaching five-year-olds this it really screws their brains up and creates psychosis later.
[02:04:43.797 --> 02:04:51.901]   And then you've got Trudeau and all the other liberals in Canada and here saying honking is Heil Hitler We need to confiscate the guns.
[02:04:51.961 --> 02:04:53.101]  And people say, well, that's ridiculous.
[02:04:53.461 --> 02:04:59.104]  Then I have video of them pulling people over all over Toronto, Ottawa, that have Canadian flags.
[02:04:59.484 --> 02:05:03.486]  And now I have the CBC saying, is the Canadian flag evil?
[02:05:03.526 --> 02:05:10.609]  Now a maple leaf, meaning, you know, we make maple syrup, which I had some this morning on my pancakes, is now racist.
[02:05:10.889 --> 02:05:13.450]  I mean, this is the left declaring ownership of everything.
[02:05:13.810 --> 02:05:17.652]  Here is this crazy woman in the parliament saying, honk, honk, means all Hitler.
[02:05:18.894 --> 02:05:20.875]  How many guns need to be seized?
[02:05:23.455 --> 02:05:34.078]  How much vitriol do we have to see of Honk Honk, which is an acronym for Hail Hitler, do we need to see by these protesters on social media?
[02:05:34.638 --> 02:05:36.599]  Meanwhile, Trudeau says he wants to be a dictator.
[02:05:36.999 --> 02:05:38.399]  Soros, work for Hitler.
[02:05:38.419 --> 02:05:41.440]  I mean, it's just, it doesn't even, it's ridiculous!
[02:05:43.123 --> 02:05:50.569]  Well, look, I'm a firm believer, and I'm not a bad person, I've always been a relatively nice person, but I do believe nice guys finish last.
[02:05:51.009 --> 02:05:55.753]  I do believe in the business world, if you're super nice, you'll have cleat marks on your face.
[02:05:55.833 --> 02:05:56.053]  Oh yeah.
[02:05:56.253 --> 02:05:58.775]  And I think Canadians are the nicest people in the world.
[02:05:59.136 --> 02:06:00.417]  And look where it just got them.
[02:06:00.717 --> 02:06:10.465]  They're now under the boot on their neck of a communist slash Nazi slash fascist authoritarian leader slash dictator slash tyrant.
[02:06:10.825 --> 02:06:12.146]  That's what being nice got them.
[02:06:12.486 --> 02:06:17.531]  The United States is tough, and I don't believe we're gonna allow this to happen, and we gotta fight, Alex!
[02:06:18.252 --> 02:06:18.632]  I agree.
[02:06:18.672 --> 02:06:23.317]  You know, you look at the hockey players in Canada, though, and I've noticed the Canadians, they're real nice, but I wouldn't want to get in a fight with them.
[02:06:23.737 --> 02:06:26.981]  I think they've awakened the sleeping giant up there, and I make a prediction.
[02:06:27.021 --> 02:06:32.946]  I think all this intimidation, and putting people in jail without bail for protesting peacefully, I predict it backfires, Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:06:32.966 --> 02:06:33.367]  What do you think?
[02:06:34.588 --> 02:06:40.552]  I hope and pray it does, but don't forget, I'm going to be a little honest here, there are reasons why they do what they do.
[02:06:41.132 --> 02:06:48.536]  I believe that my fans who came out, you know, just in Las Vegas, you know, I'm a national host, but my show is based in Las Vegas.
[02:06:48.896 --> 02:06:59.022]  And when I said, let's have a rally three times in the last year, 10,000 people showed up in Las Vegas, which is a relatively non-political town.
[02:07:01.184 --> 02:07:01.444]  Right!
[02:07:01.785 --> 02:07:05.749]  So I'm telling you, now all of a sudden everybody's got it in the back of their mind.
[02:07:06.249 --> 02:07:08.972]  If I go to a protest, who's taking down my name?
[02:07:09.312 --> 02:07:10.714]  Who's filming my face?
[02:07:11.074 --> 02:07:12.796]  Who's taking down my license number?
[02:07:13.116 --> 02:07:15.138]  Is the IRS going to come try and destroy my life?
[02:07:15.158 --> 02:07:18.181]  There's definitely a chilling effect and we got to block it or the real tyranny happens.
[02:07:18.501 --> 02:07:20.143]  People should be afraid of the chilling effect works.
[02:07:20.844 --> 02:07:22.065]  You're about to take over next hour.
[02:07:22.085 --> 02:07:22.986]  What are you going to be breaking down?
[02:07:24.474 --> 02:07:30.718]  Well, I'm going to talk about Ukraine, and I'm going to talk about open borders, and I'm going to talk about all, you know, I call it the Root Reaction.
[02:07:31.138 --> 02:07:35.981]  I react to all the stories I download each day in order that I think are the most important.
[02:07:36.282 --> 02:07:43.246]  So I'll give you a countdown of the important stories, and I'll give you my reaction, and hopefully my reaction matches the reaction of your fans, Alex.
[02:07:43.546 --> 02:07:44.086]  Absolutely.
[02:07:44.126 --> 02:07:45.307]  We love Wayne Allen Root.
[02:07:45.347 --> 02:07:46.948]  I've been watching him on TV for decades.
[02:07:46.968 --> 02:07:51.371]  We're about to come right back with him in the fourth hour that Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.
[02:07:51.391 --> 02:07:57.653]   Central today, and the only way We reach new people is when you share the articles and the videos, which I know you're doing.
[02:07:58.033 --> 02:08:00.235]  It's beautiful, and I love it, but this is a war.
[02:08:00.675 --> 02:08:04.097]  They would not be trying to suppress free speech if it was futile.
[02:08:04.677 --> 02:08:05.618]  It is not futile.
[02:08:06.138 --> 02:08:06.859]  It is victory.
[02:08:06.999 --> 02:08:13.603]  I need you to take the articles, the videos, the live feed, and the latest URL they're not blocking right now is futurenews.news.
[02:08:14.084 --> 02:08:15.324]  We've got another one we're about to launch.
[02:08:15.344 --> 02:08:17.046]  They're starting to censor futurenews.news.
[02:08:17.586 --> 02:08:22.029]  But you can do it word of mouth, infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video.
[02:08:23.638 --> 02:08:26.540]  And separately, we've got really great products at Infowar Store.
[02:08:26.881 --> 02:08:29.703]  And tomorrow, the sale on X3.
[02:08:29.723 --> 02:08:33.586]  It's got the deep earth iodine, the two other types for your immune system, your body.
[02:08:33.606 --> 02:08:34.967]  It's the opposite of fluoride.
[02:08:36.240 --> 02:08:38.903]  The opposite of bromide, the opposite of the bad halogen.
[02:08:38.943 --> 02:08:42.206]  This for your libido, your fertility, your immune system.
[02:08:42.226 --> 02:08:42.926]  This is a big one.
[02:08:43.307 --> 02:08:44.528]  It really is an amazing product.
[02:08:44.668 --> 02:08:46.590]  It is available 50% off.
[02:08:47.271 --> 02:08:49.293]  It's been sold out for four or five months.
[02:08:49.633 --> 02:08:55.318]  We've got a limited supply in and I'm going to sell it at 25% off after this or maybe full price because the supply chain is breaking down.
[02:08:55.338 --> 02:08:57.220]  It's taking so long to get products.
[02:08:57.521 --> 02:08:59.002]  So this is your chance to get it at 50% off.
[02:09:01.149 --> 02:09:11.851]  Separately, we also have Brain Force Ultra, which is cold-pressed herbs and compounds that are super fast-acting energy that burns off in about three hours.
[02:09:13.092 --> 02:09:16.112]  Last night, Joe Rogan called and said, hey, let's go hang out, go to dinner, whatever.
[02:09:16.652 --> 02:09:18.173]  I'm super tired, it's 8.30.
[02:09:18.673 --> 02:09:19.013]  Boom!
[02:09:19.253 --> 02:09:23.594]  Took a half-dropper of this, went out and hung out with Joe until like 1 a.m.
[02:09:23.614 --> 02:09:25.214]  I went to sleep right when I got home.
[02:09:25.594 --> 02:09:33.105]   It's 40% off, and the highest quality vitamin D3, Winter's Son, is 50% off at M4WarsTour.com.
[02:09:33.125 --> 02:09:34.006]  That funds our operation.
[02:09:34.406 --> 02:09:37.788]  Hour number four with Wayne Allen Root, straight ahead.
[02:09:38.148 --> 02:09:38.989]  Share those links.
[02:09:39.208 --> 02:09:48.408]  Fight the tyranny.
[02:09:48.402 --> 02:09:50.503]  I signed up for the Austin Marathon.
[02:09:50.663 --> 02:09:57.908]  I've been training, probably not as much as I should be, but thank goodness for prayer, and thank goodness for InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:09:58.208 --> 02:10:03.992]  Before I set out on a run, I throw down some TurboForce to give me that energy I need to get going.
[02:10:04.012 --> 02:10:17.201]  You know, besides the energy, TurboForce, it is giving me the vitamins I need, like vitamin C to keep me healthy, and the essential B vitamins, plus the amino acids for sustained energy, giving me the best chance at getting through the training.
[02:10:17.601 --> 02:10:21.122]  And then every day now, I'm taking Dr. Jones Soreless.
[02:10:21.462 --> 02:10:22.342]  I have bad joints.
[02:10:22.662 --> 02:10:23.323]  Thanks, Mom.
[02:10:23.563 --> 02:10:30.465]  So, this is great for giving my joints the extra support they need right now, plus inflammation support and extra flexibility.
[02:10:30.645 --> 02:10:34.646]  The quick-release capsules help me recover fast so I can get back to the training.
[02:10:35.086 --> 02:10:45.909]  Even if you're not crazy enough to take on a marathon, good news, TurboForce, that can still give you the energy and clarity you need for every day, and Soreless can keep you moving and feeling great at any age.
[02:10:46.349 --> 02:10:46.789]  All right.
[02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.650]  Hi, everybody.
[02:10:47.690 --> 02:10:51.291]  Wayne Allyn Roots is with you here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:51.331 --> 02:11:02.596]  Thank you, Alex, as always, for giving me this opportunity to grab an hour of your show and grab a few minutes of your audience's minds to educate, to empower and to entertain.
[02:11:02.616 --> 02:11:07.459]  For those of you who don't know me, my website is RootForAmerica.com.
[02:11:07.579 --> 02:11:10.541]   All of my Commentaries and videos, they're all there.
[02:11:10.621 --> 02:11:12.462]  Rootforamerica.com.
[02:11:12.502 --> 02:11:16.746]  Lots of video commentaries, lots of video podcasts, lots of audio podcasts.
[02:11:17.126 --> 02:11:25.733]  And of course, at that same website, Root for America is a link that automatically connects you to my national radio show and my podcast.
[02:11:25.773 --> 02:11:29.576]  And you can listen to old versions from yesterday, last week, last year.
[02:11:29.897 --> 02:11:32.619]  And you can listen live anytime I'm on live.
[02:11:32.639 --> 02:11:35.421]  So, Rootforamerica.com is where it all starts.
[02:11:35.481 --> 02:11:37.243]  That's my website up on the screen right now.
[02:11:37.643 --> 02:11:42.449]  And you're also seeing my book up on the screen, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:11:42.549 --> 02:11:51.461]  I think it perfectly sums up what just happened with the Canadian truckers who lit a fire under the entire world.
[02:11:52.319 --> 02:11:56.141]  And, you know, if you're wondering why I have a hoarse voice, I have the same voice as Alex, right?
[02:11:56.481 --> 02:12:02.084]  We both talk all day long on radio and TV, and my voice becomes hoarse 24 hours a day.
[02:12:02.424 --> 02:12:04.265]  And it sounds just like Alex Jones nowadays.
[02:12:04.825 --> 02:12:05.485]  It just happened.
[02:12:06.026 --> 02:12:08.287]  I guess it's because we all talk and talk and talk.
[02:12:08.627 --> 02:12:10.468]  Thank God God gave me only one gift in life.
[02:12:10.548 --> 02:12:11.168]  I'm a good talker.
[02:12:11.528 --> 02:12:12.529]  But boy, can I talk.
[02:12:12.869 --> 02:12:14.289]  So my voice is permanently hoarse.
[02:12:15.070 --> 02:12:25.823]   The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book I think is is the Canadian truckers and now it is the American truckers who are on their way with a convoy today.
[02:12:25.863 --> 02:12:29.088]  They started an hour ago and they're on their way to Washington DC.
[02:12:30.279 --> 02:12:45.644]  And the point of my book was, with rigged elections, and with all the fraud in the world, and all the banning going on, and all the censorship going on, and the rigging going on, basically the book burning going on, it's my opinion that you're not going to win just based on elections anymore.
[02:12:46.044 --> 02:12:55.567]  You're going to have to strike, you're going to have to protest, you're going to have to boycott, you're going to have to blockade, all versions of civil disobedience like Dr. Martin Luther King preached.
[02:12:55.927 --> 02:12:57.327]  But there is no choice.
[02:12:57.327 --> 02:13:02.247]   And my book tells you how to do it, and talks about this philosophy of civil disobedience.
[02:13:02.247 --> 02:13:03.247]  Never violence.
[02:13:03.247 --> 02:13:07.648]   We never want to be the ones to preach violence on the conservative right,
[02:13:07.648 --> 02:13:10.247]  because look what happened on January 6th.
[02:13:10.247 --> 02:13:14.126]  They'll try and destroy us with the most minor of incidents.
[02:13:14.126 --> 02:13:17.847]   They will paint us as evil and try and destroy the entire movement.
[02:13:17.850 --> 02:13:23.733]  So I don't respond with violence, but I respond with civil disobedience against people who are beating my brains in.
[02:13:24.053 --> 02:13:26.355]  We've got to figure out something other than just voting.
[02:13:26.675 --> 02:13:29.336]  And that's my book, The Great Patriot Protest, the boycott book.
[02:13:29.376 --> 02:13:33.779]  That's the Canadian convoy, the Canadian blockade and this American convoy.
[02:13:33.839 --> 02:13:35.000]  These people are great fighters.
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:35.480]  I love them.
[02:13:36.488 --> 02:13:38.850]  All right, so I think we've got about a minute left.
[02:13:38.890 --> 02:13:42.051]  Let me kind of go over what I'm going to talk about on today's show.
[02:13:42.432 --> 02:13:47.215]  First of all, COVID and the COVID vaccines are always a big topic with me.
[02:13:47.335 --> 02:13:49.656]  Open borders, a big topic with me.
[02:13:50.497 --> 02:13:56.801]  Some information that just came out from life insurance companies that I've been talking about for weeks.
[02:13:57.161 --> 02:14:00.483]  When I say just came out, came out about a month ago, month and a half ago.
[02:14:00.903 --> 02:14:07.868]   I've talked about it nonstop three hours a day on my national radio show, but But the mainstream media has never touched it.
[02:14:08.349 --> 02:14:10.350]  It finally came out today.
[02:14:11.011 --> 02:14:17.517]  I'm not sure if it's on the front page of the Wall Street Journal because I don't get the physical edition anymore, but I get the online Wall Street Journal.
[02:14:17.857 --> 02:14:21.440]  It was on the front page at the top of the online Wall Street Journal.
[02:14:21.861 --> 02:14:26.105]  A story about how life insurance companies are being deluged.
[02:14:26.605 --> 02:14:27.866]  By dead people.
[02:14:28.226 --> 02:14:35.791]  People are dropping dead at a rate that is historic, and they blame everything in the world except the vaccine.
[02:14:36.152 --> 02:14:36.832]  Which is a joke.
[02:14:37.052 --> 02:14:37.953]  I mean, it really is a joke.
[02:14:38.333 --> 02:14:49.841]  They don't even seem to understand that the vaccine is at the root, excuse the pun from Wayne Root, at the root of all of this is the vaccine-induced death called VAIDs.
[02:14:50.141 --> 02:14:52.383]  It's like AIDS with a V. VAIDs.
[02:14:52.823 --> 02:15:03.032]   And it's an induced Heart attack, strokes, blood clots, multi-organ failure, and perhaps most importantly, there's the story on the cover of the Wall Street Journal.
[02:15:03.372 --> 02:15:06.155]  Alex has the most crack staff I've ever seen.
[02:15:06.175 --> 02:15:07.436]  You guys are fantastic.
[02:15:07.776 --> 02:15:09.118]  I mentioned it, there it is.
[02:15:09.158 --> 02:15:09.698]  You found it.
[02:15:10.058 --> 02:15:10.539]  Great stuff.
[02:15:11.220 --> 02:15:16.686]  And the deaths are piling up, and they blame it on everything and anything except the vaccines.
[02:15:16.726 --> 02:15:19.249]  And you and I both know what's to blame for all these deaths.
[02:15:19.490 --> 02:15:20.751]  All right, we're going out for a quick break.
[02:15:21.132 --> 02:15:26.959]  Let you know again, my website's rootforamerica.com, and you could always email me, wayneroot at gmail.com.
[02:15:26.999 --> 02:15:29.702]  I love to talk to every single one of you.
[02:15:29.962 --> 02:15:30.403]  Be right back.
[02:15:31.306 --> 02:15:32.127]  All right, welcome back.
[02:15:32.187 --> 02:15:34.809]  Wayne Allyn Root, guest hosting for this hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:35.130 --> 02:15:40.014]  Let me tell you, I, you know, as a veteran for all these years, I'm actually 60 years old now.
[02:15:40.054 --> 02:15:40.555]  Can you believe it?
[02:15:41.035 --> 02:15:47.361]  But I work out 90 minutes a day and I pop 100 vitamin pills a day and I feel like a million bucks and eat healthy, by the way.
[02:15:47.781 --> 02:15:49.823]  And so I'm like Alex's philosophy, man.
[02:15:49.923 --> 02:15:54.107]  Vitamins, vitamins, vitamins have kept me alive for 40 years, alive and ticking and high energy.
[02:15:54.528 --> 02:16:08.370]   But all these years that I've been on TV, As a guest and as a host 40 years and by the way, I know vitamins work because listen to my track record I got my first TV show at the age of 26 on Financial News Network in 1989
[02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:15.405]  I was 26 years old, then I turned 27 a few days after I got the show.
[02:16:15.845 --> 02:16:25.557]  But I was 26 and 27 years old, one of the youngest anchormen on national TV, hosted all their sports program and hosted five shows a day.
[02:16:26.137 --> 02:16:26.878]  OK, five.
[02:16:26.938 --> 02:16:29.041]  I was the ultimate workhorse on TV.
[02:16:29.141 --> 02:16:30.142]  Five shows a day.
[02:16:30.851 --> 02:16:39.796]  And then I got my next TV show when I was 57 years old on Newsmax TV and I hosted it for three years.
[02:16:39.897 --> 02:16:41.137]  Actually, I was 56, excuse me.
[02:16:41.718 --> 02:16:48.802]  Three years and 700 episodes with the number one primetime slot on Newsmax TV and Bill O'Reilly three times a week.
[02:16:49.322 --> 02:16:56.785]  As my co-host, I've always been very lucky in life on the sports programming on CNBC, Jimmy the Greek, if you remember that name, was my partner.
[02:16:57.166 --> 02:17:01.267]  And in politics, it was Bill O'Reilly, and now here I am with Alex Jones.
[02:17:01.287 --> 02:17:06.210]  I always get around the biggest names and the best people, and I'm very proud to be kind of partners with them.
[02:17:07.130 --> 02:17:15.334]  So, in the history of American TV, I don't think anybody has ever gotten their first show when they're 26, and their next show when they're 56.
[02:17:17.081 --> 02:17:22.526]  30 year gap between me hosting television shows, one sports and the other politics.
[02:17:23.407 --> 02:17:24.147]  30 year gap.
[02:17:24.648 --> 02:17:27.430]  Nobody gets hired in TV at the age of 56.
[02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.711]  And I was.
[02:17:29.251 --> 02:17:34.095]  And so my point to you is vitamins, exercise changed my life.
[02:17:34.135 --> 02:17:36.857]  So thank you, Alex, for bringing us some great vitamins.
[02:17:36.897 --> 02:17:38.799]  So some things I want to talk to you about.
[02:17:39.494 --> 02:17:41.797]  Some issues that I think are at the top of my mind.
[02:17:42.057 --> 02:17:44.501]  How about the scandals with Joe Biden?
[02:17:44.521 --> 02:17:46.703]  You know, I've got a 10 minute run in this segment.
[02:17:46.723 --> 02:17:48.165]  I'll give you some Joe Biden scandals.
[02:17:48.586 --> 02:17:50.909]  First of all, what do I think Ukraine is all about?
[02:17:51.919 --> 02:17:56.784]  I think, obviously, you know, number one, Ukraine is about flexing muscles, you know?
[02:17:57.104 --> 02:17:57.704]  Here's Putin.
[02:17:57.945 --> 02:17:59.266]  He's flexing his muscles.
[02:17:59.526 --> 02:18:00.887]  He thinks he's a He-Man.
[02:18:01.187 --> 02:18:04.070]  He thinks he's, you know, the Popeye the Sailor Man.
[02:18:04.430 --> 02:18:05.351]  He's Tarzan.
[02:18:05.651 --> 02:18:08.193]  He's always shirtless and he's flexing his muscles.
[02:18:08.594 --> 02:18:14.379]  And Putin wants to prove that Biden is an old, feeble man with dementia.
[02:18:14.719 --> 02:18:16.360]  Well, guess what, Putin, I got news for you.
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:18.261]  I was there long before you.
[02:18:18.601 --> 02:18:20.342]  This guy's an old feeble man with dementia.
[02:18:20.562 --> 02:18:21.983]  And I've been saying it for four years.
[02:18:22.323 --> 02:18:24.124]  Okay, two years before he got elected president.
[02:18:24.664 --> 02:18:35.490]  And then the last year, so three years, I've been talking about Biden being a feeble old man with dementia that cannot possibly become the President of the United States and cannot possibly serve a normal term.
[02:18:36.511 --> 02:18:39.112]  So we already know he's a feeble old man with dementia.
[02:18:39.512 --> 02:18:41.233]  But Putin wants to expose him.
[02:18:41.693 --> 02:18:51.959]   And he wants to win on the grand And he has a burning desire to prove to the world that Russia is the king of the hill and America's a has-been, right?
[02:18:51.979 --> 02:18:58.423]  For the last 25 years, 30 years, Russia's been a has-been and America's been the king of the hill, right?
[02:18:58.503 --> 02:19:03.747]  Russia was the king in the 60s and the 70s competing with America, trying to prove they were better than us.
[02:19:04.067 --> 02:19:05.608]  And we beat them and we beat them and we beat them.
[02:19:05.888 --> 02:19:06.729]  We beat their brains in.
[02:19:07.443 --> 02:19:12.491]  But now he has a chance to prove it all over again, and he'll go down in history as the guy who does it.
[02:19:12.811 --> 02:19:22.145]  And by invading Ukraine, he's just embarrassing and humiliating Joe Biden, who he knows is powerless to stop him and can't do anything.
[02:19:22.165 --> 02:19:22.906]  So that's number one.
[02:19:23.496 --> 02:19:28.658]  Number two, I think, you know, against all the other things happening, there's a number two.
[02:19:29.219 --> 02:19:34.741]  Ukraine is a country rich with natural resources, especially oil and gas.
[02:19:35.201 --> 02:19:42.384]  So he covets Putin, covets the natural resources of Ukraine, and he's going to go in and pillage and rape that country.
[02:19:42.604 --> 02:19:44.525]  Excuse that term, but that's what he's going to do.
[02:19:44.565 --> 02:19:48.167]  He's going to rape it until there's nothing left and it all goes to Russia.
[02:19:48.667 --> 02:19:50.569]  Those are the two main reasons he's invading.
[02:19:51.029 --> 02:20:00.997]  But let me give you a third reason that, to my knowledge, nobody else in the American media, including conservative media, has thought of or is talking about.
[02:20:01.297 --> 02:20:02.839]  But this is my gut instinct.
[02:20:03.219 --> 02:20:12.586]  And I've asked friends of mine who are brilliant military strategists, retired, but at one point the top military strategists in America.
[02:20:12.967 --> 02:20:18.111]  And they both, when I told them this story, a light bulb went off and they said, Wayne, I think you're right.
[02:20:18.934 --> 02:20:31.819]  And so all these many months since Biden has run for president and been president, he talks a lot about the corruption in Russia and the corruption in the Ukraine and the corruption around the world.
[02:20:32.802 --> 02:20:42.284]  And I think Putin is sick and tired of hearing and being lectured about Russia's corruption when Putin knows, because I'm sure they've wiretapped.
[02:20:42.604 --> 02:20:50.545]  So they know, you know, just like Hillary Clinton tapped into Donald Trump, I guarantee you Russia is tapped into a lot of the world leaders.
[02:20:50.905 --> 02:20:57.006]  And they all know that Biden is the most corrupt politician that's ever lived.
[02:20:57.346 --> 02:21:01.367]  There's never been a more corrupt political hack than Joe Biden.
[02:21:01.992 --> 02:21:04.253]  And so they all know this.
[02:21:04.293 --> 02:21:06.013]  He's the biggest hypocrite in the world.
[02:21:06.353 --> 02:21:14.695]  He has no right to lecture Russia about the bad things Russia does and how corrupt Putin is, when in reality, Joe Biden is the big guy.
[02:21:15.215 --> 02:21:22.076]  Joe Biden is taking a 10 to 20 percent cut of every deal that his brother gets and his son Hunter gets.
[02:21:22.456 --> 02:21:24.877]  He is the most corrupt person that's ever represented.
[02:21:25.237 --> 02:21:30.161]  The United States of America and I'm sure that Joe Biden is close to a billionaire in offshore bank accounts.
[02:21:30.501 --> 02:21:35.825]  The Biden crime family is disgusting and they're so corrupt and Putin knows that.
[02:21:36.326 --> 02:21:41.524]   I believe that the secrets to Biden's corruption are located in Ukraine.
[02:21:42.064 --> 02:21:44.625]  All the dirty deals were in Ukraine.
[02:21:45.145 --> 02:22:02.332]  So if he rolls in with his tanks, Putin, to Ukraine, and he starts killing and arresting and torturing everyone, including all the top politicians and agency heads of their federal agencies, he goes out and he finds the people who did the dirty business with Joe Biden.
[02:22:02.372 --> 02:22:03.113]  He knows who they are.
[02:22:03.133 --> 02:22:03.933]  Putin knows everything.
[02:22:04.907 --> 02:22:05.467]  And guess what?
[02:22:05.967 --> 02:22:06.788]  He tortures them.
[02:22:06.828 --> 02:22:07.968]  I'm not happy about any of this.
[02:22:08.328 --> 02:22:09.529]  I'm not on Putin's side.
[02:22:09.829 --> 02:22:10.989]  I'm not on Russia's side.
[02:22:11.269 --> 02:22:12.290]  I'm on America's side.
[02:22:12.310 --> 02:22:13.110]  I love America.
[02:22:13.410 --> 02:22:14.391]  This is my country.
[02:22:15.011 --> 02:22:17.252]  But I'm just telling you what I think is happening in Putin's mind.
[02:22:17.692 --> 02:22:31.217]  He's going to go in and capture everyone who he believes did dirty deals with Joe Biden and torture them or torture their families or arrest them and just stick them in prison until they confess and tell him where all the dirty bodies are buried.
[02:22:31.577 --> 02:22:33.998]  And then he's going to either choose choice at that point.
[02:22:34.528 --> 02:22:53.196]  Putin can choose to parade all these dirty people on national TV or global TV and shock the world and prove that Joe Biden is a filthy, dirty, corrupt politician and a traitor to his own people and a traitor to the United States of America who's betrayed his offices, U.S.
[02:22:53.236 --> 02:22:54.757]  Senator, Vice President, now President.
[02:22:55.238 --> 02:22:59.045]  And then he makes him resign in disgrace, ruins his legacy.
[02:22:59.406 --> 02:23:01.250]  And who's the crusader who cleaned it up?
[02:23:01.630 --> 02:23:04.657]  The moral crusader is going to be Vladimir Putin.
[02:23:05.158 --> 02:23:06.079]  So that's one choice.
[02:23:07.105 --> 02:23:20.871]  And I think that's a key reason he's invading Ukraine in addition to flexing his muscle, making America look bad, make Russia look good and also making himself look good and also literally pillaging the country and stealing all their natural resources.
[02:23:21.211 --> 02:23:38.919]   But this is the big bonus that he's going to destroy and bring down Biden and embarrass the United States and paralyze our government because the government, you know, if All the corruption is exposed, and Biden is impeached, and Biden's kicked out of office, and Biden goes off to a nursing home.
[02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:48.165]  All of a sudden, America is very psychologically weak and fractured, and Russia enters that hole and takes advantage of it.
[02:23:48.783 --> 02:23:50.144]  And so that's option one.
[02:23:50.164 --> 02:23:51.085]  You know what option two is?
[02:23:51.686 --> 02:23:53.267]  Don't tell anybody about this.
[02:23:53.328 --> 02:23:54.569]  Don't put it on the national stage.
[02:23:54.829 --> 02:24:01.195]  Don't embarrass Biden nationally and publicly, but instead hold it over his head and blackmail Joe Biden.
[02:24:01.556 --> 02:24:03.978]  That's probably what Putin intends to do.
[02:24:04.398 --> 02:24:13.247]  Actually just keep it to himself and tell Biden, I got the goods on you and I'm going to blackmail you unless you give me and Russia everything we want.
[02:24:14.002 --> 02:24:17.045]  In the entire world, I'll destroy you and ruin your legacy.
[02:24:17.365 --> 02:24:22.269]  And all the secrets are kept basically in the vault of Ukraine.
[02:24:22.629 --> 02:24:25.391]  And that's one of the reasons he's invading Ukraine.
[02:24:25.752 --> 02:24:26.712]  This is my belief.
[02:24:27.153 --> 02:24:28.394]  This is my gut instinct.
[02:24:28.714 --> 02:24:29.835]  This is my guess.
[02:24:30.215 --> 02:24:31.116]  It's not a fact.
[02:24:31.496 --> 02:24:34.479]  But I'm telling you, if I'm Putin, this is how I'm thinking.
[02:24:34.799 --> 02:24:36.881]  And I believe I know Putin and I understand him.
[02:24:37.161 --> 02:24:41.905]  And I'm telling you, Joe Biden, you better be shaking in your boots because Putin's coming.
[02:24:42.737 --> 02:24:45.599]  And I think he's coming to get you and destroy your legacy.
[02:24:45.699 --> 02:24:46.880]  Just my opinion.
[02:24:48.441 --> 02:24:49.342]  We're headed to a break.
[02:24:49.762 --> 02:24:50.403]  Losing my voice.
[02:24:52.385 --> 02:24:53.105]  Headed to a break.
[02:24:54.066 --> 02:24:55.607]  My website, RootForAmerica.com.
[02:24:57.028 --> 02:24:58.869]  My email, WayneRoot, at gmail.com.
[02:24:59.510 --> 02:25:03.673]  And my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:25:04.033 --> 02:25:05.815]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones.
[02:25:07.549 --> 02:25:08.410]  All right, welcome back.
[02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:09.411]  Got my voice back.
[02:25:10.411 --> 02:25:12.333]  I can't wait for this afternoon, three hours of radio.
[02:25:14.674 --> 02:25:34.609]  I was going to make a point in the last segment, I never did, that because I've been around for 40 years on TV, literally TV and radio, every time I make an appearance, I know it's a popular show by how many people contact me on my cell phone, text me, friends, you know, not fans, friends, and say, I'm watching you right now.
[02:25:35.268 --> 02:25:37.449]  And years ago, I used to be a lot on Fox News.
[02:25:37.929 --> 02:25:42.731]  So I guess Fox News decided that I tell the truth too much and they can't have me on anymore and that scares them.
[02:25:43.811 --> 02:25:48.613]  And so when I was on Fox News, I would have like 20-25 people contact me.
[02:25:49.073 --> 02:25:55.215]  After just a quick segment on Fox and Friends, 25 people would contact me and say, just saw you on Fox.
[02:25:55.295 --> 02:25:55.815]  Wow, Wayne!
[02:25:56.687 --> 02:26:02.552]  And I've tried a lot of things over the years and never have I gotten that kind of response.
[02:26:02.632 --> 02:26:10.739]  It doesn't sound like a lot, but if 20-25 friends contact you, you know that's an example that millions are watching Fox News.
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:16.364]  Well, the most response I ever get now of anything I do is the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:16.484 --> 02:26:26.590]   Every time I come on here, Or more texts from friends saying, holy crap, I'm watching you now on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:26.950 --> 02:26:30.652]  I didn't even know that so many of my friends watch the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:31.092 --> 02:26:35.174]  But the numbers are about the same as I used to get on Fox News.
[02:26:35.794 --> 02:26:42.297]  So if 20 people contact me now and 20 people contact me in the Fox News days, Fox always had 3 million watching.
[02:26:42.984 --> 02:26:49.886]  I think Alex Jones has one heck of a popular show with millions online watching all across the world, not just the United States.
[02:26:49.906 --> 02:26:52.846]  So thank you for blessing me, Alex, with this platform.
[02:26:53.586 --> 02:26:55.887]  So let me continue with my Joe Biden story.
[02:26:55.907 --> 02:26:56.707]  I have a couple of stories.
[02:26:56.727 --> 02:27:02.228]  When we get back, then I'm going to start to react with what I call my root reaction to all the biggest news stories in the news.
[02:27:02.628 --> 02:27:09.430]  And the big one to me is still COVID and the COVID vaccines and what it's doing to the American people, which is killing them and injuring them.
[02:27:11.135 --> 02:27:15.739]  I told you why I think that Vladimir Putin is invading Ukraine.
[02:27:15.759 --> 02:27:22.724]  And one of the reasons is to go after Biden's corruption and expose it to the world or use it to blackmail Biden.
[02:27:23.104 --> 02:27:24.285]  And by the way, who's already doing that?
[02:27:24.525 --> 02:27:24.825]  China.
[02:27:25.826 --> 02:27:26.547]  It's very clear.
[02:27:26.567 --> 02:27:33.131]  I mean, even Bill Maher on HBO will tell you that China owns Joe Biden.
[02:27:33.151 --> 02:27:33.912]  There it is right there.
[02:27:34.232 --> 02:27:37.575]  Here's the I guess that's the Russian bear owning Joe Biden.
[02:27:37.955 --> 02:27:40.397]  But I think China owns Joe Biden right now.
[02:27:41.669 --> 02:27:44.510]  And I think that Russia, Vladimir Putin, is very jealous.
[02:27:44.991 --> 02:27:50.433]  He wants to own the nice little pet Joe Biden and pet him on the head and say, good boy, good boy.
[02:27:50.453 --> 02:27:51.853]  He's like my dog, Bubba.
[02:27:52.074 --> 02:27:53.174]  Good boy, good boy.
[02:27:53.214 --> 02:27:54.535]  Whatever I want, Bubba does.
[02:27:54.955 --> 02:28:00.377]  Well, that's what Putin wants Biden to do, just like Xi in China has Biden doing right now.
[02:28:00.817 --> 02:28:02.818]  Biden's his pet, his little pet.
[02:28:03.934 --> 02:28:08.721]  His pet puppy and Biden and the Biden White House are owned by China, clearly.
[02:28:09.181 --> 02:28:10.543]  So Putin wants to get in on the act.
[02:28:11.064 --> 02:28:12.686]  One more thing that comes out of Ukraine.
[02:28:13.507 --> 02:28:19.476]  China is watching what happens and how Joe Biden handles this situation.
[02:28:20.206 --> 02:28:25.208]  And they already own him because I believe they're already blackmailing him because he did so many dirty things in China.
[02:28:25.589 --> 02:28:32.232]  And every single bit of dirty corruption that Joe Biden did in China and his son Hunter did dirty things that have nothing to do with corruption.
[02:28:32.552 --> 02:28:34.253]  They have to do with with girls.
[02:28:35.133 --> 02:28:41.336]  But the end result is that every dirty thing done under the Biden name in China, they have videotaped.
[02:28:41.776 --> 02:28:47.579]  So they're blackmailing the whole Biden family with all the dirt and all the sex of Hunter and all the dirty things they did.
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:52.924]  But I think they're watching to see how Joe Biden handles Ukraine.
[02:28:53.585 --> 02:29:03.254]  And if it happens and plays out the way they believe it will, and I believe it will, Joe Biden will be powerless and Putin will make him look like a pipsqueak and America look like a weakling.
[02:29:04.475 --> 02:29:05.736]  Then China will take Taiwan.
[02:29:06.638 --> 02:29:07.299]  And it's going to happen.
[02:29:07.339 --> 02:29:08.801]  And this is not something new I'm saying.
[02:29:09.282 --> 02:29:12.667]  I've said this since the day Biden got in office.
[02:29:12.687 --> 02:29:13.488]  Was it January 20, 2021?
[02:29:14.269 --> 02:29:19.417]  I think it was January 20 that he swore in, put his hand on the Bible and swore in.
[02:29:20.578 --> 02:29:22.241]  I said, Taiwan's gone.
[02:29:22.904 --> 02:29:23.804]  Taiwan is gone.
[02:29:24.385 --> 02:29:26.706]  And sure enough, Taiwan is going to be gone.
[02:29:27.146 --> 02:29:36.811]  And here's the headline right now at Zero Hedge, one of my favorite websites, along with InfoWars and and of course, some of the other really good ones like the Gateway Pundit and Breitbart.
[02:29:36.851 --> 02:29:40.473]  Also, those are some of my favorites and my website, RootForAmerica.com.
[02:29:40.773 --> 02:29:43.054]  Those are the ones I check in on all day long.
[02:29:43.154 --> 02:29:46.836]  And Zero Hedge is a great business site and they have great insights.
[02:29:48.078 --> 02:29:59.601]  And the headline is China calls the United States a culprit for the Ukraine tensions and vows to eradicate Taiwan's secessionist regime.
[02:30:00.282 --> 02:30:03.463]  They want to eradicate Taiwan's regime.
[02:30:04.283 --> 02:30:08.764]  China, I'm telling you, is weeks away from taking over Taiwan.
[02:30:09.324 --> 02:30:10.385]  Now, that could mean two weeks.
[02:30:10.505 --> 02:30:12.545]  It could mean 50 weeks, a year from now.
[02:30:13.105 --> 02:30:22.147]   But in the reasonable future, China will take invade and take Taiwan just like they've taken Hong Kong without even a shot being fired.
[02:30:22.607 --> 02:30:28.853]  China now has totally taken over Hong Kong and there's only repression and there's no political freedom.
[02:30:29.938 --> 02:30:35.000]  There's repression, and there's persecution, and there's banning, and there's book-burning.
[02:30:35.380 --> 02:30:48.486]  All the things going on in Canada and America are going on at a much higher level, because the Chinese take it to such extremes, and send the Uyghurs, the Muslims of China are sent to concentration camps.
[02:30:48.906 --> 02:30:52.908]  China does everything at a Nazi-like, old Soviet-like level.
[02:30:52.948 --> 02:30:53.328]  Terrible.
[02:30:53.968 --> 02:30:58.290]  So, China's watching, and they're going to take Taiwan as soon as we prove weak on Ukraine.
[02:30:58.850 --> 02:31:04.233]  Okay, the other Joe Biden scandal that I want to break here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:05.693 --> 02:31:08.314]  And I think I mentioned it the last time I was on Alex's show.
[02:31:08.354 --> 02:31:11.236]  I mentioned it with a sentence or two, but I want to explain it now.
[02:31:12.216 --> 02:31:18.479]  So and I explained it to President Trump when I had him on my show just a couple weeks ago and he said, I can't wait to hear it.
[02:31:18.519 --> 02:31:22.261]  Please send me all the details as soon as you can and I'm compiling everything right now.
[02:31:23.621 --> 02:31:27.243]  So a friend of mine is in the import-export business.
[02:31:27.958 --> 02:31:32.682]  And one of the things he imports is COVID antigen tests from China.
[02:31:33.343 --> 02:31:39.908]  And he knows exactly what he pays from the same company that Joe Biden just bought his antigen test from.
[02:31:40.649 --> 02:31:44.793]  Same product, same exact antigen test, same exact company.
[02:31:45.313 --> 02:31:47.455]  Now, this guy buys 100,000 at a time.
[02:31:47.895 --> 02:31:50.257]  Joe Biden just bought, I believe it's 300 million.
[02:31:50.277 --> 02:31:50.658]  300 million!
[02:31:53.821 --> 02:31:58.245]  300 million COVID antigen tests, and it was published exactly what Joe Biden paid.
[02:31:58.805 --> 02:32:04.170]  I think the number, I don't have it in front of me, but I've got all my notes, and I've got all the newspaper articles and all the online articles.
[02:32:04.650 --> 02:32:11.416]  He paid $1.3 billion, and then he bought a second load, and that was like another $500 million.
[02:32:11.716 --> 02:32:13.658]  So altogether, he spent like $1.8, $1.9 billion on the COVID antigen tests.
[02:32:13.678 --> 02:32:14.138]  My buddy bought 100,000.
[02:32:13.997 --> 02:32:18.518]  $1.9 billion on the COVID antigen tests.
[02:32:18.518 --> 02:32:20.157]  My buddy bought a hundred thousand.
[02:32:20.157 --> 02:32:22.717]  Now, first of all, common sense.
[02:32:22.795 --> 02:32:27.517]  Don't you think if you buy $100,000, the price will be higher than someone who buys $300 million plus?
[02:32:28.158 --> 02:32:30.639]  Wouldn't you get a better deal if you bought $300 million plus?
[02:32:31.199 --> 02:32:32.700]  Joe Biden got a much worse deal.
[02:32:33.661 --> 02:32:36.462]  And when you do the math, my buddy paid $1 a test.
[02:32:36.983 --> 02:32:40.565]  Joe Biden and the American government paid, I think it was either $4 or $5 a test.
[02:32:41.305 --> 02:32:44.547]  He was grossly ripped off by China.
[02:32:45.183 --> 02:33:01.291]  Now, the question is, is Joe Biden so dumb and the Biden administration so dumb that they lost a billion dollars of taxpayer money and were a bunch of patsies and rubes and fools and Joe Biden's an incompetent, old, feeble puppet with dementia?
[02:33:01.891 --> 02:33:12.957]  Or did the Biden crime family grab a kickback of several hundred million dollars by overpaying China with American taxpayers' money, your money, by about a billion dollars?
[02:33:13.517 --> 02:33:14.738]  My guess is number two.
[02:33:15.218 --> 02:33:27.666]  I believe there should be a massive DOJ investigation and the Biden family picked up several hundred million dollars in kickback slash bribes for overpaying with other people's money.
[02:33:28.126 --> 02:33:32.649]  You, the taxpayers money, about a billion dollar ripoff.
[02:33:33.129 --> 02:33:36.391]  It's a huge story and it's just a fact, folks.
[02:33:36.731 --> 02:33:41.654]  But I'll say allegedly, but it's a fact what my friend pays a dollar a test.
[02:33:42.215 --> 02:33:42.938]  A dollar a test.
[02:33:43.238 --> 02:33:44.563]  It's a fact what Joe Biden pay.
[02:33:44.924 --> 02:33:45.466]  We'll be right back.
[02:33:46.067 --> 02:33:47.827]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root, welcome back.
[02:33:47.887 --> 02:33:51.008]  I'm the guest host for this hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:51.028 --> 02:33:56.229]  We'll be doing this on a regular basis on Tuesdays between 12 to 1 p.m.
[02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:57.229]  West Coast time.
[02:33:57.649 --> 02:33:59.190]  So that's 3 to 4 p.m.
[02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:00.810]  East Coast time.
[02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:02.990]  We'll be trying to do this on a very regular basis.
[02:34:03.451 --> 02:34:07.531]  Wayne Allyn Root with this hour as the guest host for my great friend Alex Jones.
[02:34:07.571 --> 02:34:10.792]  He does a great job and I think I'm going to read his mind now.
[02:34:10.812 --> 02:34:15.033]  I think he does this for the same reason that I often have guest hosts on my national radio show.
[02:34:15.614 --> 02:34:19.782]  Because the stress on our minds, our bodies, and our voices.
[02:34:19.822 --> 02:34:23.290]  You hear my voice, very jagged and very rough.
[02:34:24.457 --> 02:34:24.797]  Of course.
[02:34:25.618 --> 02:34:26.739]  The stress is enormous.
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:28.101]  I mean, I do this all day long.
[02:34:28.641 --> 02:34:47.581]  Some days, not only am I three hours on radio and an hour on TV here with Alex Jones, actually 90 minutes today, first a guest of Alex Jones and then hosting, but some days I'm also doing eight or ten radio interviews and then I'm the CEO of multiple companies, so I'm in multiple meetings and Zoom calls all day long.
[02:34:48.341 --> 02:34:53.244]  So, it just never ends, as well as a father and a husband and four kids and crazy life.
[02:34:53.304 --> 02:34:54.784]  So, you need a break once in a while.
[02:34:54.824 --> 02:34:57.926]  So, I hope I can make your life just a little bit easier, Alex Jones.
[02:34:58.226 --> 02:34:58.606]  Good man.
[02:34:58.686 --> 02:35:01.267]  My website, again, I'm Wayne Allen Root.
[02:35:01.588 --> 02:35:04.529]  My website's RootForAmerica.com.
[02:35:04.549 --> 02:35:05.609]  There it is up on the screen.
[02:35:06.050 --> 02:35:07.771]  RootForAmerica.com.
[02:35:08.971 --> 02:35:14.934]  And you can find all my information there, and you can connect to my daily national radio show there.
[02:35:15.683 --> 02:35:19.805]  So, and my email is waynerootatgmail.com, love to hear from you.
[02:35:20.465 --> 02:35:28.908]  All right, some of the stories I want to get into, this is what I call my root reaction, where I get to react to some of the stories in the news and tell you what I think of them.
[02:35:29.909 --> 02:35:38.592]  I don't know if you noticed, but Bill Maher, and I was a guest many times on Bill Maher's shows, and I'm hoping to be on Bill Maher's show again in the very near future, talking to them about it.
[02:35:39.213 --> 02:35:42.314]  Bill Maher lately has sounded like a raving conservative.
[02:35:42.814 --> 02:35:49.698]  And I'm sure that scares the heck out of his, you know, communist, progressive, socialist handlers at HBO and in Hollywood.
[02:35:49.738 --> 02:35:52.479]  And, you know, if he's not careful, we'll get a show canceled.
[02:35:52.499 --> 02:35:56.801]  We better be careful because he's starting to bite back at the liberals.
[02:35:56.841 --> 02:35:58.182]  He sounds a lot like Joe Rogan.
[02:35:58.846 --> 02:36:01.249]  Joe Rogan started out as kind of liberal.
[02:36:01.269 --> 02:36:03.991]  He said he was a Bernie Sanders guy back in 2016.
[02:36:04.231 --> 02:36:06.774]  You don't get more liberal than that.
[02:36:06.814 --> 02:36:17.585]  I don't even know if Joe realizes, he may have liked some of the things Bernie Sanders said, but I don't know if Joe Rogan realizes that in 2016 I analyzed the voting record of the United States Senate.
[02:36:18.718 --> 02:36:25.219]  And Bernie Sanders was the single most liberal voting record in the entire United States Senate, filled with horrible liberals.
[02:36:25.559 --> 02:36:27.520]  He was the liberal of all liberals of all liberals.
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:29.140]  So, I mean, he is socialist.
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:37.961]  But I do admit that Bernie had an appeal back in 2016, despite his socialism, to the average guy or gal on the street.
[02:36:38.261 --> 02:36:45.543]  And I think Joe, Joe Rogan, who I like a lot, by the way, I think Joe Rogan felt that appeal and thought, hey, the two party system sucks.
[02:36:45.943 --> 02:36:46.703]  Both parties suck.
[02:36:47.909 --> 02:36:49.110]  Trump was unproven to him.
[02:36:49.631 --> 02:36:51.172]  So let me let me go with a Bernie Sanders.
[02:36:51.212 --> 02:36:51.912]  Okay, fine.
[02:36:52.233 --> 02:36:53.053]  You're allowed a mulligan.
[02:36:54.254 --> 02:36:59.524]   But Joe Rogan has made this amazing Metamorphosis over the last few years.
[02:37:00.064 --> 02:37:02.124]  And he's gone, you know, like a butterfly does.
[02:37:02.144 --> 02:37:03.644]  He's turned into this beautiful butterfly.
[02:37:04.025 --> 02:37:15.287]  Joe Rogan is now a very conservative guy on topics that are near and dear to my heart, including the vaccine mandate and including the feeble dementia, Latin condition of Joe Biden.
[02:37:15.307 --> 02:37:16.668]  Joe Rogan understands all that.
[02:37:17.048 --> 02:37:18.528]  He's become very conservative.
[02:37:18.568 --> 02:37:19.688]  I think he's seen the light.
[02:37:20.028 --> 02:37:25.131]   He may not want to admit he's a conservative Republican, But he certainly has seen the light.
[02:37:25.431 --> 02:37:27.733]  And I think he does admit, Joe Rogan, that he's a libertarian.
[02:37:28.033 --> 02:37:32.857]  And I was the libertarian vice presidential nominee in 2008 on the libertarian presidential ticket.
[02:37:33.217 --> 02:37:36.700]  So Joe Rogan and I have started to become simpatico and I like him a lot.
[02:37:37.620 --> 02:37:41.243]  But Bill Maher is starting to go down that road of Joe Rogan.
[02:37:42.604 --> 02:37:47.528]  From liberal and liking of Bernie Sanders to sounding more and more like Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:37:48.254 --> 02:37:57.141]  And so Bill Maher said the other day that companies and celebrities have decided to be just a little bit evil on China and become their bitch.
[02:37:58.121 --> 02:38:01.224]  That's what that was a quote, direct quote from Bill Maher.
[02:38:01.284 --> 02:38:03.145]  They become the bitch of China.
[02:38:03.185 --> 02:38:04.486]  That's what Joe Biden is, by the way.
[02:38:04.926 --> 02:38:06.447]  And soon he's going to be the bitch of Russia.
[02:38:07.088 --> 02:38:08.489]  But that there it is.
[02:38:08.689 --> 02:38:11.271]  I love this to work with this crack team.
[02:38:11.631 --> 02:38:12.352]  Look at that right away.
[02:38:12.392 --> 02:38:13.232]  They get it up on the screen.
[02:38:13.272 --> 02:38:13.893]  You guys are great.
[02:38:14.313 --> 02:38:14.714]  Kudos.
[02:38:14.834 --> 02:38:15.254]  Bravo.
[02:38:15.574 --> 02:38:16.215]  Wenger loves you.
[02:38:16.275 --> 02:38:16.575]  Thank you.
[02:38:18.203 --> 02:38:22.486]  So, Bill Maher is starting to sound like he's seen the light, and he understands.
[02:38:23.306 --> 02:38:25.408]  All these, and you know who I think of right away?
[02:38:25.848 --> 02:38:27.229]  It's every American corporation.
[02:38:27.749 --> 02:38:31.272]  But it's the NBA, and it's the NFL, I think of right away.
[02:38:31.872 --> 02:38:33.974]  They've all sold out to China.
[02:38:34.674 --> 02:38:43.460]  And if China can make them an extra billion dollars, or two billion, or four billion, or ten billion, they're willing to look the other way.
[02:38:44.113 --> 02:38:49.559]  Well, China murders people and sends them to hard labor camps and concentration camps.
[02:38:50.099 --> 02:38:51.320]  And how about this one?
[02:38:52.181 --> 02:38:57.567]  Sends COVID to the world and kills millions and millions of people.
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:02.404]  Do you not believe that China sent COVID to the United States?
[02:39:02.464 --> 02:39:23.802]  I'll bet you every person watching right now agrees with me that China sent COVID to destroy us and to destroy their nemesis, Donald J. Trump, and make sure the American economy was destroyed and millions are out of work and millions were sick and Trump would get all the blame and Trump wouldn't be reelected because he had his boot on China's neck.
[02:39:24.423 --> 02:39:25.848]  China was screwed.
[02:39:26.349 --> 02:39:27.974]  We were destroying China.
[02:39:28.315 --> 02:39:31.766]  Trump was giving China the middle finger and it was all over for China.
[02:39:32.899 --> 02:39:35.522]  And China suddenly sent our way.
[02:39:35.562 --> 02:39:39.145]  There's Dr. Fauci in red because he's obviously owned by China as well.
[02:39:39.605 --> 02:39:40.886]  What a disgusting man.
[02:39:41.147 --> 02:39:42.928]  Remember that movie with Dr. Evil?
[02:39:43.248 --> 02:39:45.250]  Fauci is the Dr. Evil.
[02:39:45.691 --> 02:39:52.617]  And in the end, I think someday if we ever have a fair press and a fair justice system, he will be charged with mass murder.
[02:39:53.097 --> 02:39:58.002]  OK, whether it's on the strong scale that he woke up one day and said, let's murder millions.
[02:39:58.522 --> 02:39:59.442]  Or on the light scale.
[02:39:59.482 --> 02:40:00.443]  He never said anything like that.
[02:40:00.823 --> 02:40:11.547]  He just said, let's get rich with big pharma and let's push the vaccine and let's hide any of the negative side effects of the vaccine and let's convince people to give it to their little children.
[02:40:11.887 --> 02:40:13.568]  And when they all die, murder.
[02:40:13.588 --> 02:40:19.030]  OK, I don't care if you blame him for mass murder or it's manslaughter and it's a contributing factor.
[02:40:19.451 --> 02:40:19.971]  It's murder.
[02:40:20.511 --> 02:40:21.351]  He's Dr. Evil.
[02:40:22.872 --> 02:40:26.853]  But China is the one that sent COVID our way and Fauci's in bed with China.
[02:40:27.374 --> 02:40:28.014]  So there you have it.
[02:40:28.755 --> 02:40:45.320]  So that's the first story was Bill Maher admitting that there are celebrities out there and there's the NBA and the NFL and all the sports leagues and all the companies that want to make billions are screwing over America and you and me and taking the side of China.
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:52.402]  And then there's the story I told you that I would talk to you about cover of today's Wall Street Journal rise.
[02:40:53.687 --> 02:40:56.948]  Non-COVID-19 deaths hit life insurers.
[02:40:57.708 --> 02:41:04.591]  Companies believe lack of medical treatments during the pandemic has contributed to deaths from other causes.
[02:41:05.111 --> 02:41:06.451]  They don't mention the vaccine.
[02:41:06.851 --> 02:41:07.491]  Of course not.
[02:41:07.872 --> 02:41:11.133]  The Wall Street Journal is RINO, Republican in name only.
[02:41:11.613 --> 02:41:13.753]  The Wall Street Journal is pro-corporatist.
[02:41:14.274 --> 02:41:16.554]  The Wall Street Journal is in bed with Big Pharma.
[02:41:16.974 --> 02:41:19.955]  The Wall Street Journal gets lots of money from Big Pharma.
[02:41:20.315 --> 02:41:21.756]  They can't admit it's the vaccines.
[02:41:22.324 --> 02:41:26.626]  But this is the first crack, the first hole in the dam.
[02:41:27.246 --> 02:41:32.028]  You know, they're trying their best to keep their finger in the dam and stop the water from coming out.
[02:41:32.568 --> 02:41:41.032]  But all the people in big pharma and the vaccine manufacturers and everybody making money on it, they're all getting rich on the vaccines that are killing people.
[02:41:42.032 --> 02:41:45.274]  And they can't admit to you that the vaccines are killing people.
[02:41:45.314 --> 02:41:50.056]  But all the insurance companies are now coming out and they're admitting that death rates are up.
[02:41:51.197 --> 02:41:53.158]  40% across the board.
[02:41:53.699 --> 02:41:55.560]  Non-COVID deaths.
[02:41:55.580 --> 02:41:57.000]  These are not COVID deaths.
[02:41:57.481 --> 02:41:59.482]  These are non-COVID deaths.
[02:41:59.802 --> 02:42:08.091]   Heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, multi-organ failure, and get this, Massive increase in cancer all over people's bodies.
[02:42:08.732 --> 02:42:17.875]  People who have beaten cancer and people who have never had cancer suddenly have cancer everywhere in their body after they've been vaccinated, specifically after they've been boosted.
[02:42:18.395 --> 02:42:30.419]  That booster is horrible and they're trying to convince you to take it by blacking out all the facts and all the truth in the VAERS report and in reports all around the world.
[02:42:31.020 --> 02:42:34.941]   Hospitals, And funeral directors and life insurance companies.
[02:42:35.341 --> 02:42:37.465]  The deaths are skyrocketing.
[02:42:37.906 --> 02:42:44.677]  People are dropping dead left and right and celebrities are dropping dead left and right.
[02:42:44.897 --> 02:42:45.658]  How much time we have left?
[02:42:45.678 --> 02:42:46.580]  About 30 seconds or so?
[02:42:49.106 --> 02:42:49.406]  40 seconds.
[02:42:49.426 --> 02:42:49.626]  All right.
[02:42:50.207 --> 02:42:53.628]  So I want to read you the underneath the picture on the cover of The Wall Street Journal.
[02:42:54.168 --> 02:43:06.954]  It says, among other insurance executives, Hartford Financial CEO Christopher Swift has noted an outsized number of benefit claims for non-COVID-19 specific debts.
[02:43:07.494 --> 02:43:15.680]   So what they are admitting is, separate from COVID, There's an avalanche of deaths around the United States and around the world.
[02:43:16.041 --> 02:43:26.630]  And by the way, it's only people in the working ages between 18 and 65 because the corporations and Biden mandated they get the vaccine.
[02:43:27.551 --> 02:43:28.972]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root, welcome back.
[02:43:29.662 --> 02:43:30.943]  I'm trying to pace myself today.
[02:43:30.963 --> 02:43:33.506]  You know, usually Alex and I have the same kind of energy.
[02:43:33.526 --> 02:43:35.928]  I'm like a crazy man, but I'm losing my voice.
[02:43:35.968 --> 02:43:39.492]  If I, if I keep it my usual style, I'll just lose my voice.
[02:43:39.532 --> 02:43:42.475]  I'm a little calmer than usual today, but I'm getting the same points across.
[02:43:42.975 --> 02:43:44.857]  I'll try my best to bring a little fire.
[02:43:45.638 --> 02:43:47.160]  So first of all, who's me?
[02:43:47.900 --> 02:43:48.381]  Wayne on the Root.
[02:43:49.855 --> 02:43:51.616]  And you can find me at RootForAmerica.com.
[02:43:51.656 --> 02:43:54.478]  Anything you want to know about me, my bio, everything's there.
[02:43:54.518 --> 02:44:05.325]  RootForAmerica.com, the former Libertarian Vice Presidential nominee in 2008 and national radio talk show star for three years, national TV talk shows on Newsmax TV.
[02:44:06.545 --> 02:44:11.546]  Author of many best-selling books including my latest The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott book is my latest.
[02:44:11.946 --> 02:44:12.667]  I think you'll love it.
[02:44:12.727 --> 02:44:21.249]  Grab a copy at Amazon or Barnes & Noble The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott book which shows you how to be like the Canadian truckers and now the American truckers.
[02:44:21.269 --> 02:44:21.969]  We've got a strike.
[02:44:22.329 --> 02:44:23.069]  We got a revolt.
[02:44:23.209 --> 02:44:24.329]  We got to intimidate.
[02:44:24.749 --> 02:44:25.850]  We have to blockade.
[02:44:26.230 --> 02:44:27.510]  We have to boycott.
[02:44:27.850 --> 02:44:31.051]  All the things we have to do and I give you a list of every company to go after.
[02:44:32.350 --> 02:44:40.935]  Every company to go after and the name of their CEO and how to reach them by him or her, by email and by phone and by social media.
[02:44:40.975 --> 02:44:42.456]  I mean, nobody's got this information.
[02:44:42.936 --> 02:44:46.558]  I hired a team of telemarketers 24 hours a day to go after this information.
[02:44:46.598 --> 02:44:46.919]  I got it.
[02:44:46.979 --> 02:44:50.241]  I put it in the book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:44:50.741 --> 02:44:50.921]  All right.
[02:44:51.161 --> 02:44:53.743]  And you can always reach me, Wayne Root at gmail.com.
[02:44:54.263 --> 02:44:57.525]  There's a great story on my phone right now, the UK Daily Mail.
[02:44:58.391 --> 02:45:10.762]  And it says, breaking news, two prosecutors leading the Manhattan criminal probe into Donald Trump resign after new DA Alvin Bragg raises serious doubts about the case.
[02:45:11.221 --> 02:45:15.822]   The probe grinds to a halt with no witnesses questioned for a month.
[02:45:15.822 --> 02:45:17.621]  And I bring that up because I love President Trump.
[02:45:17.621 --> 02:45:19.140]  I'm a fan of President Trump.
[02:45:19.140 --> 02:45:20.681]  We disagree on one issue.
[02:45:20.681 --> 02:45:21.681]  All of you know that.
[02:45:21.681 --> 02:45:22.681]  The vaccine.
[02:45:22.681 --> 02:45:26.980]   I'm about as anti-vaccine, this specific vaccine, as anyone in America.
[02:45:26.980 --> 02:45:32.701]   And I've been on the case about what a death jab this is since literally the first moment
[02:45:32.701 --> 02:45:34.261]  a year and a quarter ago.
[02:45:34.804 --> 02:45:35.945]  So we disagree on that issue.
[02:45:35.965 --> 02:45:38.627]  But putting that aside, we agree on everything else in life.
[02:45:39.067 --> 02:45:42.990]  And I know that this has been a witch hunt against my dear friend, President Donald J. Trump.
[02:45:43.330 --> 02:45:44.951]  And it's disgusting what they've done to him.
[02:45:45.251 --> 02:45:49.975]  And they've tried to destroy every business he's in, and destroy his name, and destroy his family.
[02:45:50.415 --> 02:45:51.816]  And I'm so happy to see that.
[02:45:52.196 --> 02:45:53.457]  These people should go to hell.
[02:45:53.477 --> 02:45:56.159]  They're the most vicious, disgusting people ever.
[02:45:56.199 --> 02:46:16.366]   And those of you who, because of the vaccine or whatever, you know, think Trump didn't do enough, Trump did everything a human being could do in four years in office, being hounded, being witch hunted, being attacked by everyone, by the right, by the left, by Republicans, by Democrats, by senators, by congressmen, by governors.
[02:46:16.886 --> 02:46:18.688]  Nobody was on Trump's side.
[02:46:19.048 --> 02:46:22.271]  He was a one-man army and a one-man wrecking crew.
[02:46:23.332 --> 02:46:28.946]   And he did everything, or I like to call him a bull in a china shop, And we have a lot in common, by the way.
[02:46:29.386 --> 02:46:39.675]  And he did everything a human being could do with the entire government and every government agency that was under him out to destroy him and his family.
[02:46:41.076 --> 02:46:42.637]  It was just incredible what they did.
[02:46:42.677 --> 02:46:48.121]  And they fixed the election and eventually kicked him out because they were so scared of what he'd do in the next four years.
[02:46:48.642 --> 02:47:05.303]   Don't forget that when the White House was under siege at one point by Black Lives Matter and Antifa, Trump had Uh, law enforcement people and generals lying to him and telling him he couldn't do what he could do and telling him the crowd wasn't as bad as he thought it was.
[02:47:05.723 --> 02:47:06.784]  And they lied to him.
[02:47:07.084 --> 02:47:17.531]  Just every, he had a General Milley who went to China and behind our backs as a traitor told him, I hate this guy, Trump, and if he attacks you, I'll give you advance warning.
[02:47:18.363 --> 02:47:35.550]  Milley should be in Cuba, Guantanamo, on trial for treason and if found guilty, life in prison or death penalty for treason, let alone by a general who's the chief of staff, the number one general in the United States of America committed treason against the United States and against Donald Trump.
[02:47:35.910 --> 02:47:36.931]  There he is, General Milley.
[02:47:37.291 --> 02:47:40.192]  So it's so disgusting what Trump had to put up with.
[02:47:40.232 --> 02:47:41.973]  So yes, he wasn't perfect.
[02:47:42.013 --> 02:47:42.893]  He isn't perfect.
[02:47:43.253 --> 02:47:48.987]   And I can name you 10 things that I think I would have done differently or better But it doesn't matter.
[02:47:49.047 --> 02:47:50.888]  You don't know the pressure he was under.
[02:47:50.908 --> 02:47:51.928]  You don't know what was happening.
[02:47:52.388 --> 02:48:03.830]  You don't know, understand how destructive the left is and what they did to him and what they said about him and how many death threats there were and how many people wanted to murder that poor man and his family.
[02:48:04.350 --> 02:48:04.890]  Incredible.
[02:48:05.210 --> 02:48:07.950]  I will always love and appreciate President Donald Trump.
[02:48:07.990 --> 02:48:10.691]  And there's another example of what's happening.
[02:48:10.931 --> 02:48:15.132]  They tried another witch hunt and you got nothing.
[02:48:15.732 --> 02:48:16.112]  Nothing.
[02:48:16.452 --> 02:48:16.692]  All right.
[02:48:17.987 --> 02:48:20.908]  On to COVID, which is the one area I disagree with Trump.
[02:48:20.948 --> 02:48:22.248]  But you know, he's coming around.
[02:48:22.628 --> 02:48:34.991]  You heard Alex open my appearance in the last hour of his show when we were, I was a guest on his show by saying, Wayne Root, he knows for a fact from insiders at Mar-a-Lago that Wayne Root had an effect on President Trump.
[02:48:35.051 --> 02:48:39.072]  I said, you can't discuss how great the vaccine is ever again.
[02:48:39.513 --> 02:48:41.493]  Just discuss how bad the vaccine mandate is.
[02:48:41.913 --> 02:48:44.614]  And ever since then, that's exactly what President Trump did.
[02:48:46.664 --> 02:48:47.205]  I'm a fan.
[02:48:47.545 --> 02:48:48.145]  I'm a big fan.
[02:48:49.146 --> 02:48:51.188]  He's not perfect, and we can't agree on everything.
[02:48:51.768 --> 02:49:03.317]  But the Fire Department of New York, FDNY, union head of the FDNY, seeks investigation into recent Fire Department deaths from COVID jabs.
[02:49:04.818 --> 02:49:14.186]  Three people have died, two of them in their early 30s, firemen, and one of them in his early 50s, dropped dead for no reason in the middle of training.
[02:49:15.399 --> 02:49:16.440]  And it just doesn't happen.
[02:49:16.460 --> 02:49:20.723]  30-year-old firemen don't drop dead in the middle of training.
[02:49:22.344 --> 02:49:25.146]  And soccer stars don't drop dead on soccer fields.
[02:49:25.746 --> 02:49:28.508]  What's happening across this country is insanity.
[02:49:28.988 --> 02:49:33.791]  And across this world, insanity that no one is willing to say out loud.
[02:49:34.532 --> 02:49:36.233]  Is this from the vaccine?
[02:49:37.214 --> 02:49:38.755]  All these people dropping dead.
[02:49:39.275 --> 02:49:40.476]  All these insurance deaths.
[02:49:40.816 --> 02:49:41.837]  There you see on the screen.
[02:49:43.098 --> 02:49:45.139]  Soccer players just dropping dead.
[02:49:46.996 --> 02:49:48.537]  No one's ever seen anything like this.
[02:49:49.057 --> 02:49:49.397]  Look at this.
[02:49:50.097 --> 02:49:56.520]  World-class athletes in the prime of their lives, in their youth, dropping over.
[02:49:56.980 --> 02:50:01.722]  Heart attacks, cardiac arrest, and death happening left and right.
[02:50:02.982 --> 02:50:03.442]  Incredible.
[02:50:03.502 --> 02:50:04.963]  Same thing with airline pilots.
[02:50:05.483 --> 02:50:11.485]  They're having quite a few medical emergencies with airline pilots who are all forced to take the jab.
[02:50:12.006 --> 02:50:24.658]   It's the same reason That the life insurance companies are saying there's all this death that they've never seen before because people are dropping dead and they all just happen to be between 18 and 65.
[02:50:25.218 --> 02:50:39.061]  As a matter of fact, I heard the biggest numbers are up to 18 and 45 because they were forced to take the jab at their corporation because of Biden's corporate mandate through OSHA.
[02:50:39.824 --> 02:50:42.144]  Okay, and they're all paying the price.
[02:50:42.224 --> 02:50:42.925]  Disgusting.
[02:50:43.365 --> 02:50:43.905]  Disgusting.
[02:50:44.185 --> 02:50:51.326]  So now the Fire Department of New York Union head seeks an investigation into recent department deaths and he says, is it?
[02:50:51.906 --> 02:50:53.467]  He's not saying it is the COVID jab.
[02:50:53.787 --> 02:50:56.727]  He's asking, is it the COVID jab?
[02:50:57.227 --> 02:50:59.968]  Shouldn't we all be asking the question?
[02:51:01.668 --> 02:51:06.469]  Here's another story about autopsies confirm COVID vaccine induced deaths.
[02:51:08.091 --> 02:51:12.953]  You never know why someone drops dead unless you do an autopsy.
[02:51:13.673 --> 02:51:16.494]  And there are very few autopsies being done because they don't want them done.
[02:51:17.214 --> 02:51:30.778]  The few autopsies that have been absolutely demanded and done and I'd assume perhaps the relatives or the spouse of the people who die pay for it to force it to be done because government doesn't want you having an autopsy.
[02:51:31.359 --> 02:51:34.580]  Especially if you're 25 years old and you drop dead of a heart attack.
[02:51:34.620 --> 02:51:35.520]  They don't want an autopsy.
[02:51:36.181 --> 02:51:40.284]  The autopsies that have been done here and in Germany, it can't be a coincidence.
[02:51:41.024 --> 02:51:46.928]  Almost every single person that they check, their body is filled with blood clots.
[02:51:46.968 --> 02:51:48.428]  Their blood is like cement.
[02:51:48.789 --> 02:51:52.211]  Their organs have hardened since they got the vaccine.
[02:51:52.971 --> 02:51:56.413]  It is vaccine-induced AIDS for all intents and purposes.
[02:51:56.874 --> 02:51:57.374]  VAIDS.
[02:51:58.158 --> 02:52:01.020]  It is causing their bodies to block.
[02:52:01.581 --> 02:52:03.202]  The blockages are thick.
[02:52:03.682 --> 02:52:05.344]  The blockages are scary.
[02:52:05.704 --> 02:52:10.108]  And it causes heart attacks and strokes and all kinds of horrible problems.
[02:52:11.469 --> 02:52:12.670]  And their bodies are filled with it.
[02:52:13.090 --> 02:52:15.452]  And there was one group that did 15 autopsies.
[02:52:15.952 --> 02:52:20.676]  And all 15, not one of them was classified as having anything to do with a vaccine.
[02:52:21.357 --> 02:52:29.042]  And when they got in and did the autopsy, 14 out of the 15 deaths were directly related to the vaccine.
[02:52:30.023 --> 02:52:32.404]  All right, I've talked about the vaccine enough.
[02:52:33.024 --> 02:52:34.605]  In the time I've left, what do I have left?
[02:52:34.645 --> 02:52:35.286]  A minute, two minutes?
[02:52:35.326 --> 02:52:35.706]  What's left?
[02:52:38.448 --> 02:52:39.328]  About a minute 20.
[02:52:39.388 --> 02:52:39.609]  All right.
[02:52:40.209 --> 02:52:43.091]  I just want to mention Senator Shelby of Alabama.
[02:52:43.551 --> 02:52:48.034]  By the way, he's kind of a rhino, but it doesn't mean he doesn't have good things to say from time to time.
[02:52:48.729 --> 02:52:57.074]  He admitted in the last few days that 42% of the babies born in America are on Medicaid.
[02:52:57.575 --> 02:53:01.517]  In other words, the mom is on Medicaid.
[02:53:01.537 --> 02:53:05.059]  42% of the babies now born in America, Medicaid.
[02:53:05.380 --> 02:53:09.862]  My parents taught me I'd rather die than accept welfare from the government.
[02:53:10.403 --> 02:53:17.067]  And now 42% of the babies born are born to probably almost all single mothers who are on Medicaid.
[02:53:17.873 --> 02:53:18.594]  And there you have it.
[02:53:18.714 --> 02:53:20.275]  That's why people still vote Democrat.
[02:53:20.715 --> 02:53:25.198]  They are bribed by government with welfare checks and Medicaid checks.
[02:53:25.928 --> 02:53:27.589]  And then one more stat before we go.
[02:53:27.709 --> 02:53:33.314]  Illegal immigration fuels record 46 million foreign-born people in the United States.
[02:53:33.794 --> 02:53:48.225]  So it's a combination of filling this country with open borders, with millions of new immigrants, and they all want welfare, and their babies are all born on Medicaid, and they'll all vote reliably and loyally Democrat for the rest of all time, because they want the checks to keep coming.
[02:53:48.605 --> 02:53:49.186]  There you have it.
[02:53:49.526 --> 02:53:50.227]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:53:50.627 --> 02:53:51.828]  WayneRoot at gmail.com.
[02:53:51.848 --> 02:53:53.770]  My website, RootForAmerican.com.
[02:53:53.810 --> 02:53:56.733]  My book, The Great Patriot Protest, and boycott book.
[02:53:56.572 --> 02:53:58.672]  Thank you for letting me host this hour.
[02:53:58.672 --> 02:54:01.251]  (upbeat music)
[02:54:01.251 --> 02:54:13.451]   You are insane if you are not supplementing vitamin D3 and vitamin K in your life.
[02:54:13.764 --> 02:54:14.884]  That's not my opinion.
[02:54:15.445 --> 02:54:27.340]   If you look at the facts, you are crazy if you're not taking it at least several times a week, especially if you've got darker skin and aren't getting a bunch of sun.
[02:54:27.340 --> 02:54:33.199]   Just look into vitamin D3 and folks that have more melanin in their skin and the fact that that blocks the sun
[02:54:33.199 --> 02:54:35.899]  and then your body can't produce it naturally.
[02:54:35.899 --> 02:54:38.380]  The best place to get it is naturally from the sun.
[02:54:38.380 --> 02:54:44.319]   The second best place is by ingesting it and the best way to do that is under the tongue
[02:54:44.319 --> 02:54:48.019]  into the blood vessels so it goes directly in the blood.
[02:54:48.019 --> 02:54:51.659]   And that's how you take winter sun is sublingually under the tongue.
[02:54:51.659 --> 02:54:56.099]   Now this is a high-end, organic, bioavailable vitamin D3.
[02:54:56.099 --> 02:55:03.058]   And then on top of it, it has a high-quality vitamin K because the two work in synergy,
[02:55:03.058 --> 02:55:07.940]   not just for your immune system, but every major function in the body.
[02:55:07.940 --> 02:55:11.699]   And when I forget sometimes to take it for a week, I feel it, I notice it.
[02:55:11.699 --> 02:55:15.979]   I religiously now henpeck my dad and call him every couple days
[02:55:15.979 --> 02:55:17.418]  and make sure he's taking it.
[02:55:17.418 --> 02:55:20.819]   I go over to his house every couple of weeks and check that the bottles are going down.
[02:55:20.819 --> 02:55:25.979]   And since he's been doing it for six months, it has been miraculous he looks 10 years younger.
[02:55:25.979 --> 02:55:31.498]   Ladies and gentlemen, I am religiously now taking it every morning, a couple drops under the tongue.
[02:55:31.498 --> 02:55:37.020]   It's great for children, it's great for adults, it is extremely critical for older people
[02:55:37.020 --> 02:55:38.859]  and again, folks with brown skin.
[02:55:39.199 --> 02:55:52.908]  If you've got brown skin or you've got dark brown skin, you better listen to me and research this because the system isn't telling you why black folks out there are dropping dead in such massive numbers, but we are here talking about it.
[02:55:53.209 --> 02:55:56.331]  The number one issue is vitamin D3.
[02:55:56.471 --> 02:55:58.012]  You must have it to live.
[02:55:58.331 --> 02:56:02.491]   Wherever you get it, get your vitamin D. We have a high quality source, back in stock,
[02:56:02.491 --> 02:56:16.451]  50% off, winter sun, Infowarsstore.com.
[02:56:16.451 --> 02:56:20.771]  You're looking at Infowars' newest designer t-shirt.
[02:56:21.604 --> 02:56:23.706]  It's the presidential emoji shirt.
[02:56:24.547 --> 02:56:32.153]  And it's got all 46 presidents going back to the founding of this nation with George Washington.
[02:56:32.714 --> 02:56:36.096]  And it ends up with Obama, Trump and Biden.
[02:56:36.657 --> 02:56:38.118]  And of course, Biden is a clown.
[02:56:38.578 --> 02:56:40.300]  Trump's wearing the sunglasses and we know.
[02:56:40.760 --> 02:56:47.840]   uh... that uh... brocco bomb is not a good friend of america this shirt is very thought-provoking it'll cause a lot of
[02:56:47.840 --> 02:56:49.720]   conversations as a great
[02:56:49.720 --> 02:56:53.679]   way to wake people up and also makes a great gift you're not just
[02:56:53.679 --> 02:56:58.119]   giving someone the gift of a fun t-shirt you give them this
[02:56:58.119 --> 02:57:02.760]   you're also funding the information war and there are dozens and dozens and
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:06.920]   dozens of new t-shirts that we've designed the last six months
[02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:12.410]   they're now available at infowarestore.com and when you purchase the shirt you're
[02:57:12.410 --> 02:57:15.799]   giving yourself the gift of waking up the world and living in a free society
[02:57:16.204 --> 02:57:19.225]  So get one for yourself and give one as a gift.
[02:57:19.605 --> 02:57:22.586]  All of it is a 360 win and it keeps us on the air.
[02:57:22.926 --> 02:57:32.230]  All the Democrats and the Deep State and the Demos Group and Klaus Schwab and the Globalists are fighting around the clock to shut us down because they can't succeed if we stay on the air.
[02:57:32.990 --> 02:57:38.713]  And of course, we have a whole line of amazing 1776 shirts in short sleeve and long sleeve.
[02:57:39.093 --> 02:57:44.356]  And then, of course, there's one of my favorites, the Vaccine Passport T-shirt.
[02:57:44.796 --> 02:57:54.161]  This lets the globalists know you're not signing on to their mark of the beast, and you're fully aware of what they're doing, and you're educating other sheeple at the same time while funding the InfoWar.
[02:57:54.521 --> 02:57:55.781]  A true 360 win.

[02:58:01.324 --> 02:58:05.347]  All of this art is original and it's incredibly thought-provoking, like this one.
[02:58:06.087 --> 02:58:10.070]  You've got one mouse asking the other mouse, are you going to take the vaccine?
[02:58:10.551 --> 02:58:11.391]  He says, no way!
[02:58:11.811 --> 02:58:14.273]  They haven't even finished the human trials yet.
[02:58:15.014 --> 02:58:18.256]  These are the type of shirts you'll find exclusively at m4wrestore.com.
[02:58:18.596 --> 02:58:21.259]  Again, hundreds and hundreds of shirts to choose from.

[02:58:25.303 --> 02:58:27.426]  And it funds the info war, and it spreads the word.
[02:58:27.486 --> 02:58:30.649]  Like this one, which is mainly for Texans, but other folks might want one.
[02:58:31.250 --> 02:58:33.392]  Most likely to secede.
[02:58:34.173 --> 02:58:41.075]  It's all available at MFORWARSTORE.COM and it keeps us on air and it exercises free speech in the public, something the left doesn't want.
[02:58:41.475 --> 02:58:45.616]  So again, thanks for keeping us on the air and thanks for shopping at MFORWARSTORE.COM.
[02:58:45.896 --> 02:59:01.160]  I want to salute and thank you all for your support and want to encourage you to go and get these t-shirts and other pieces of apparel and wear them openly, loudly, and proudly and let the leftists know they're never going to silence us, they're never going to break our will, and we are going to take America and the world back.
