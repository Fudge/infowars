[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.374]  So Biden unofficially declares war on Russia during the State of the Union.
[00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:05.316]  Are we going to have follow-up from the media?
[00:00:05.497 --> 00:00:08.261]  Is anybody going to ask Jen Psaki, are we at war with Russia?
[00:00:08.481 --> 00:00:13.828]  Are we mobilizing the troops with all the big threats and all the big talk that Joe Biden made last night?
[00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:18.509]  Are we starting a war with Russia?
[00:00:18.569 --> 00:00:21.651]  Are we getting into a nuclear confrontation with Russia?
[00:00:21.731 --> 00:00:22.652]  Is that actually happening?
[00:00:22.712 --> 00:00:25.895]  Is Biden actually going to seize property from Russians?
[00:00:26.195 --> 00:00:27.015]  How's he going to do that?
[00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:28.577]  Is he going to send the military in?
[00:00:29.077 --> 00:00:30.078]  See, that's what I'm saying.
[00:00:30.718 --> 00:00:38.304]  Even the media that drools over Joe Biden can't even ask legitimate questions.
[00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:41.826]  How are you going to confiscate Russians' property?
[00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.628]  How are you going to make Putin pay?
[00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:56.499]  So Biden puffs up his chest like he's giving a wartime speech, unofficially declares war on Russia, and it's just like, oh, it was so great!
[00:00:57.019 --> 00:00:57.960]  Oh my gosh!
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.461]  Oh, I'm just so moved!
[00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:03.143]  But see, it's all hollow.
[00:01:04.384 --> 00:01:05.585]  It's all empty words.
[00:01:06.365 --> 00:01:15.051]  And even the American media that loves Biden so much admits that today by not making a bigger deal over the fact he basically unofficially declared war with Russia last night.
[00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:16.292]  So this is Biden.
[00:01:17.657 --> 00:01:29.462]  Just flapping his gums, threatening Russia, threatening Putin, all hollow, all empty, just to act like a tough guy in the State of the Union, with a speech that's two weeks too late.
[00:01:30.803 --> 00:01:37.385]  It's almost as if someone wrote that speech from two weeks ago, and he just couldn't hack it, so they just included it in last night's State of the Union.
[00:01:37.605 --> 00:01:44.605]   From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:45.605 --> 00:02:00.605]  [Music]
[00:02:00.605 --> 00:02:03.734]   InfoWars Tomorrow's news.
[00:02:03.793 --> 00:02:05.793]  today.
[00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:25.793]  I'm going to show you a video of the news.
[00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:41.793]  It's Wednesday, March 2nd, 2022.
[00:02:41.964 --> 00:02:48.588]  And you're listening to another original edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:50.950]  And I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:58.795]  I want to be very, very clear and make a very, very precise differentiation about something that's happening.
[00:03:00.603 --> 00:03:19.880]   If the Ukrainian people decide to self-determinate, as we did with our Declaration of Independence, from its historical connection to Russia, and if they choose to abolish That form of government, that is their right and that is their duty as any free people to do so.
[00:03:20.801 --> 00:03:33.093]  And because Russia was born in Ukraine, that argument becomes even stronger if you have that perspective and if the people of Ukraine are willing to stand up and fight back and defeat Russia.
[00:03:34.861 --> 00:03:37.663]  That said, let's just look at the facts.
[00:03:37.743 --> 00:03:52.932]  Corporate media, especially the UK and the US based corporate media, have been lying for now eight days, saying that the Ukrainians have dealt huge defeats to Putin and huge defeats to the Russians.
[00:03:54.493 --> 00:03:55.673]  And that is just not true.
[00:03:57.394 --> 00:04:08.408]   From the beginning, When this was officially launched seven, eight days ago, Putin said, we're going to encircle your main cities and then try to remove your government.
[00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:15.291]  And we'll have to escalate the force at each stage until Zelensky gives up.
[00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:24.614]  And there's no doubt, unless all of NATO basically attacked right now, that Putin would not be successful in that.
[00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:38.788]  And so we're talking about a major conflict with a major world power, arguably the third largest military, perhaps the second largest military in the world with the second largest nuclear force.
[00:04:39.528 --> 00:04:42.509]  And so it's just not realistic unless we want to destroy the planet.
[00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.370]  It's totally insane.
[00:04:44.591 --> 00:05:11.479]   But the corporate media lying to Ukrainians and telling them that they're winning and making up the ghost of Kiev and making up the Snake Island stuff and Making all that up to try to encourage not just Ukrainians but other people from around Europe and as far away as Australia and Nigeria to get on airplanes and fly to Poland and other areas around Ukraine to go be part of that war.
[00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:15.733]  Is really suckering people into certain death.
[00:05:16.353 --> 00:05:18.074]  And that is absolutely their right to go do it.
[00:05:18.154 --> 00:05:20.075]  And I'm not attacking people that go decide to do that.
[00:05:20.916 --> 00:05:35.024]  I'm just sitting back and pointing out that Putin, the Munich conference in 2007, and then at countless other conferences said, if you continue to move troops up to our borders, I'm going to go into those countries and I'm going to attack them and kick them out.
[00:05:35.044 --> 00:05:38.426]  He said, it's one thing if you expanded NATO four or five times.
[00:05:39.436 --> 00:05:42.436]  up to within just a few hundred miles of our border.
[00:05:42.436 --> 00:05:47.275]   But if you push right up to our border with weapons, we're going to attack you.
[00:05:47.275 --> 00:05:49.636]  So that was the ultimatum.
[00:05:49.636 --> 00:05:55.076]   And the globalists said to Putin, fine, we'll go ahead and have a war with you.
[00:05:55.076 --> 00:05:58.076]  And so Putin called their bluff.
[00:05:58.076 --> 00:06:04.596]   And so that's the reality of where we are right now, with the major cities in Central and Eastern Ukraine
[00:06:04.596 --> 00:06:10.516]   surrounded by hundreds of thousands of Russian troops with high-tech weapons who are going to start really
[00:06:10.516 --> 00:06:11.795]  leveling those areas.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:21.753]   And a lot of that is because NATO and the West goaded and manipulated Ukraine Into this conflict with Russia in the last eight years.
[00:06:22.473 --> 00:06:28.138]  And it really accelerated with the overthrow of an elected pro-Russian president in Ukraine eight years ago.
[00:06:29.018 --> 00:06:37.365]  So this tug of war between the West and Russia over Ukraine has come to serious blows and endangers the peace and security of the entire planet.
[00:06:37.525 --> 00:06:39.867]  We'll be right back on this special edition of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:40.247 --> 00:06:42.609]  Owen Schroer will be the main maestro.
[00:06:45.706 --> 00:06:47.787]  It's Wednesday, March 2nd, 2022.
[00:06:48.167 --> 00:06:50.728]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:51.228 --> 00:06:58.811]  Owen Schroer will be taking over here in just a few minutes, and I'll be returning with reports throughout the day and throughout the evening.
[00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:01.272]  And again, I'll be back in town on Friday.
[00:07:01.292 --> 00:07:05.674]  I want to thank you all for joining us on this extremely important broadcast.
[00:07:06.314 --> 00:07:13.355]   Now, before we get into the massive developments taking place in Ukraine, and major government officials in Western governments
[00:07:13.355 --> 00:07:18.774]   calling for a no-fly zone and military strikes on Russian targets, which would quickly
[00:07:18.774 --> 00:07:22.315]   escalate into a massive war and maybe even a nuclear war.
[00:07:22.315 --> 00:07:28.074]   I want to just talk about some of the big issues that are getting overshadowed by this
[00:07:28.074 --> 00:07:30.394]  that are incredibly serious.
[00:07:30.394 --> 00:07:36.315]   And then if we focus on them and keep them in the public eye, could really not just wound
[00:07:36.315 --> 00:07:42.355]   the mad scientist wing of the New World Order, but actually bring them down.
[00:07:42.355 --> 00:07:45.754]   Doesn't mean the world will be perfect, doesn't mean we'll all be saved, doesn't mean there
[00:07:45.754 --> 00:07:48.074]  won't still be evil.
[00:07:48.074 --> 00:07:50.235]  But this current group of psychos.
[00:07:51.178 --> 00:07:56.023]  That said, above our governments playing us off against each other should really be brought down right now.
[00:07:56.063 --> 00:08:01.488]  They are in a very, very weak position, and that's why they signaled to Putin that he could go ahead and invade.
[00:08:01.508 --> 00:08:02.789]  It's a real conflict.
[00:08:03.329 --> 00:08:14.480]  The globalists don't control Putin, but they did signal that he could go ahead and grab it because that's the next phase of the next distraction while they implode the world economy and while they cause hyperinflation.
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:23.155]   I'll get to that coming up, but the big issue I'm glad that Owen did a great job of this yesterday because I was tuned into it in between the work I'm doing.
[00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:42.980]  Laying out just the unbelievable developments that have come out in the last few weeks and just the last few days and yesterday, where the CDC put a bunch of links to prestigious studies, some of which came out six months ago, some of which just came out in the last few weeks that we already covered, on their website.
[00:08:44.882 --> 00:09:04.790]  Yes, the MRNA shots of Moderna and Pfizer absolutely have increased heart swelling and heart attacks and blood clots, but that you should separate taking the shots by at least two months because the first dose basically just plants it in your body and then programs your body.
[00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:13.972]   The next time you get hit with it, your body produces Massive Spike Protein, which is the patented HIV delivery system of Moderna, patented 2016.
[00:09:14.392 --> 00:09:27.804]  And again, those are some of the other huge developments that have come out in the last month that are confirmed, what we reported two years ago from the major Indian Institute that scanned the virus and said the same thing, that it was a patented, weaponized HIV delivery system.
[00:09:28.564 --> 00:09:31.647]  To have major British medical journals and major U.S.
[00:09:31.667 --> 00:09:39.623]   journals all come out and absolutely confirm and say it's one out of three trillion that this could have happened naturally and then the CEO of
[00:09:39.623 --> 00:09:43.123]   Moderna says okay looks like it did get made in a lab looks like
[00:09:43.123 --> 00:09:48.163]   somebody spliced our synthetic virus with other virus uh yeah Peter Daszak and
[00:09:48.163 --> 00:09:52.682]   Bill Gates and Fauci in contracts with you and they co-own
[00:09:52.682 --> 00:09:59.602]   in the case of Gates and Fauci the damn Moderna spike I mean not only is it one out of three trillion that
[00:09:59.602 --> 00:10:05.083]   this could happen then the people that are involved in it are virus makers
[00:10:05.083 --> 00:10:12.923]   and are the people that control the labs in China and in the United States and in Europe
[00:10:11.069 --> 00:10:13.951]  So it's one out of three trillion for this to actually occur.
[00:10:14.351 --> 00:10:16.533]  But then it supposedly naturally occurs.
[00:10:18.208 --> 00:10:21.352]  With the very people that we have documents on that they patented the exact thing.
[00:10:21.572 --> 00:10:23.775]  So we don't just know that they patented and owned it.
[00:10:23.835 --> 00:10:31.084]  We also, again, know that they were the ones that were deliberately creating it and telling us that, get ready, the world's about to end.
[00:10:31.525 --> 00:10:34.308]  Deadly viruses are about to be released because of global warming.
[00:10:34.328 --> 00:10:36.952]  They're going to come out of the jungle, so they're going to wipe everybody out.
[00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.408]  And then it just goes on from there.
[00:10:39.408 --> 00:10:47.450]   The numbers by German and now French and now Brazilian, and of course, first major
[00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:49.370]  North American, Canadian and U.S.
[00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:54.710]   insurance company, consortium of more than a hundred companies coming out and
[00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.410]  saying 40% increase in overall death.
[00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:02.529]   That's way beyond world war II, way beyond world war I, way beyond the year
[00:11:02.529 --> 00:11:06.329]   2020 when the virus supposedly was ravaging everybody, but the year that we
[00:11:06.329 --> 00:11:12.689]   get the so-called vaccine, a 40% cause of death increase across the board, men and
[00:11:12.689 --> 00:11:19.450]   women, 18 to 65, the working age group, ladies and gentlemen, this is smoking.
[00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:20.490]  Guys.
[00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:25.570]   So while we're talking about tens of thousands of dead Ukrainians and Russians.
[00:11:25.606 --> 00:11:26.788]  And yes, it's tens of thousands.
[00:11:27.028 --> 00:11:29.891]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Russians have a reason to play it down, so do the Ukrainians.
[00:11:29.931 --> 00:11:33.395]  But when this is all said and done, you're going to find out the numbers are much larger than what they've been telling you.
[00:11:33.655 --> 00:11:34.556]  This is a full-on war.
[00:11:35.797 --> 00:11:41.103]  Don't you ever see stuff like this since, you know, really, Korea.
[00:11:41.723 --> 00:11:48.612]   But continuing on here, They want to turn the page, have a new chapter.
[00:11:49.733 --> 00:11:56.514]  Even Bloomberg and others have said, oh, you know, after the two years of the lockdowns, after two years of the vaccine, people are tired.
[00:11:56.994 --> 00:12:02.775]  Now this war will help turn the page and Biden will help turn the page.
[00:12:02.915 --> 00:12:04.976]  So obviously Russia is a huge story.
[00:12:05.076 --> 00:12:05.916]  Ukraine's giant.
[00:12:06.436 --> 00:12:09.796]  What's happening with Biden literally melting down worse than we thought.
[00:12:09.836 --> 00:12:11.917]  I know Owen's going to cover that next segment.
[00:12:13.078 --> 00:12:26.113]  It's huge a creepy old weird man connected to pedophilia Saying oh you have the government's with children that want to be another sex That's the state from the elementary school level up getting involved confusing your children.
[00:12:26.153 --> 00:12:34.223]   Here's a creepy man You know Capital talking about sex and and children and sexual identity of children.
[00:12:34.764 --> 00:12:36.104]  That's between parents and their children.
[00:12:36.124 --> 00:12:58.029]   I mean this is just unbelievable and then saying that you know, Iran has attacked Ukraine and Just all and Pelosi rubbing her hands together all weird like some type of giant rat this is The curse we're under of these decadent, degenerating individuals.
[00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.712]  There's one other big point I want to make here that's also extremely important.
[00:13:03.013 --> 00:13:09.978]  And if listeners will just please take notes and please think about this because this is a big, big deal.
[00:13:10.439 --> 00:13:12.380]  And I've realized how important it is.
[00:13:13.021 --> 00:13:20.846]  And I'm just going to mention it here, but in the future, in the near future, I'm going to do a whole report on this and really make a big deal about it because it's so central.
[00:13:22.031 --> 00:13:29.018]  If you study the whole history of the United States and what's happened in the last hundred years, since British intelligence basically took over U.S.
[00:13:29.078 --> 00:13:35.984]  intelligence completely by the 30s, and then took over the whole government with the 1947 National Security Act.
[00:13:36.945 --> 00:13:39.087]  And again, it wasn't the British people or the UK that did that.
[00:13:39.106 --> 00:13:45.746]   It was this private intelligence corporate network of Cecil Rhodes and Lord Milner that
[00:13:45.746 --> 00:13:49.067]   was able to do it with their Anglophile counterparts here in the United States.
[00:13:49.067 --> 00:13:54.706]   And they took on the aristocratic system of rich, powerful families, sending their sons
[00:13:54.706 --> 00:13:58.625]   and then daughters out in diplomatic corps to maintain the empire.
[00:13:58.625 --> 00:14:02.985]   And so there was a merger of the remnants of the British empire with the American empire.
[00:14:02.985 --> 00:14:03.985]  And that's not debated.
[00:14:03.985 --> 00:14:09.266]   Churchill wrote about it in his three volume history of the English speaking peoples.
[00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:10.826]  This is just a fact that's on record.
[00:14:10.837 --> 00:14:16.764]  If you talk to any one of the Blue Bloods on the East Coast, they will tell you that they are basically British or they're the heirs of that.
[00:14:17.464 --> 00:14:19.647]  And they believe they're basically superior to everyone.
[00:14:20.087 --> 00:14:21.149]  They believe they own you.
[00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:22.570]  They believe they own your children.
[00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.154]  They believe that America is a bunch of evil, degenerate hayseeds.
[00:14:26.995 --> 00:14:30.939]  I'm going to be talking more about this, but just understanding who the American ruling class is.
[00:14:30.758 --> 00:14:32.458]  are loyal to that whole corrupt system.
[00:14:32.458 --> 00:14:34.097]  Just turn on Fox News or CNN.
[00:14:34.097 --> 00:14:37.118]  They just worship the filthy royals who aren't even British.
[00:14:37.118 --> 00:14:41.418]   So I'm going to be talking more about this, but just understanding
[00:14:41.418 --> 00:14:43.058]  who the American ruling class is.
[00:14:43.058 --> 00:14:47.018]  Hollywood is like their sycophantic propagandist group.
[00:14:47.018 --> 00:14:51.538]   And those groups are incestuous as well, both literally and figuratively
[00:14:51.538 --> 00:14:54.858]  with the East Coast, Anglophile lackeys.
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:15:02.764]  But I know over the years, and also from some family that work in it and other things, how these State Department people operate.
[00:15:03.465 --> 00:15:12.630]  And I had a guest in the other day whose dad had been involved in it, and he was describing some of the same things that are well known, but not well known to the public, well known in the establishment.
[00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.131]  They know how degenerate they are.
[00:15:14.571 --> 00:15:30.535]  And so you've got literally a couple thousand families total that are the servant class of the globalist owners who think they're God, who think that they're better than everybody, and who think that we're all here just to serve at their pleasure.
[00:15:30.555 --> 00:15:32.835]  I'm going to be exposing these people in the near future.
[00:15:33.155 --> 00:15:33.915]  Back to Owen Schroer.
[00:15:34.615 --> 00:15:35.656]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:37.276 --> 00:15:41.677]  And actually, we're going to go to break here, but when we come back, we'll go back to Alex Jones.
[00:15:43.322 --> 00:15:51.690]  With more response from the Biden State of the Union, you know, we're just, we're reaching a point of such insanity.
[00:15:53.672 --> 00:15:58.257]  And last night's State of the Union was so hilariously ludicrous.
[00:16:00.014 --> 00:16:11.937]  And then it's like you dig into more of what's going on with Ukraine and Russia and the history of it, and you just realize, you know, our media might as well not even exist, except for the fact they're agents of propaganda.
[00:16:12.717 --> 00:16:13.458]  And we are back.
[00:16:13.658 --> 00:16:17.299]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:16:17.699 --> 00:16:18.499]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:16:18.679 --> 00:16:31.780]   Owen Schroer is about to take over, and obviously he'll be breaking down the unbelievable disintegration of the globalist puppet Joe Biden on international television last night at the State of the destruction of our union. He'll be getting into the
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:38.590]   huge developments in Ukraine as now Putin has completed encircling the major cities including the
[00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:44.811]   capital and has begun leveling government buildings and television and radio communication towers. So
[00:16:44.811 --> 00:16:50.780]   that is all coming up. We need to pray for peace. We need to pray also that more Americans and
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:57.611]   others get involved to make sure that NATO and other organizations don't escalate the situation with
[00:16:57.611 --> 00:17:02.840]   Russia and bring us into a full continental war, potential nuclear war.
[00:17:03.006 --> 00:17:12.070]  But in closing, I mentioned the ruling class State Department type Harvard-Yale combine who just believe they own us and run us.
[00:17:13.601 --> 00:17:23.955]  Clearly if you go back 50, 60, 70, 80 years ago they were elitist but they were competent in many ways and at least had a good work ethic.
[00:17:24.796 --> 00:17:35.611]   Over the years I have had a chance To talk to a lot of the people that are the protective groups in the diplomatic detail for the embassies.
[00:17:36.311 --> 00:17:47.858]  Because it's not just the Marines, it's the military, it's paramilitary CIA, it's Army Rangers, Green Berets, Delta Force, Navy SEALs, all of that, Blackwater.
[00:17:48.397 --> 00:17:53.957]   There's a lot of different groups and organizations over the time that work in and around these
[00:17:53.957 --> 00:17:58.278]   individuals and I can tell you that I've not just read it in the news, I've not just read
[00:17:58.278 --> 00:18:02.076]   it in books by other folks that have worked for the Foreign Service.
[00:18:02.076 --> 00:18:07.076]   I didn't just talk to some family that witnessed some of this as well around the world, but
[00:18:07.076 --> 00:18:12.957]   I've talked to many different groups of people that are on record with the photos and the
[00:18:12.957 --> 00:18:21.038]   facts and the proof that documents it all, that they specifically worked for these presidents
[00:18:21.038 --> 00:18:25.957]  and for the heads of the State Department and you name it.
[00:18:25.925 --> 00:18:28.547]  And this is incredible.
[00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:39.404]   Over two-thirds of the diplomatic corps is on psychotropic drugs and also amphetamines.
[00:18:40.226 --> 00:18:41.028]  Things like Adderall.
[00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:43.531]  And they also drink like fish.
[00:18:44.471 --> 00:18:47.392]  They're basically like Elvis Presley, but he was just singing music in Las Vegas.
[00:18:47.932 --> 00:18:56.676]  So also when you see Pelosi up there rubbing her hands together, all acting weird and crazy, and you see Biden not knowing who he is, talking about stories about dead dogs and corn, corn pop.
[00:18:58.096 --> 00:19:03.858]  These aren't just really old people who are clinging on to power and running our country and the world on the ground.
[00:19:04.198 --> 00:19:07.280]  They're also on a lot of drugs.
[00:19:08.618 --> 00:19:10.919]  And that's the big takeaway when you watch the State of the Union.
[00:19:10.959 --> 00:19:17.521]  And that's some of the stories and reports that I'm going to be codifying and putting out and getting out from mainstream news.
[00:19:18.021 --> 00:19:19.402]  I'm not going to give any secret stuff out.
[00:19:19.442 --> 00:19:28.465]  I'm just going to go from where these stories have actually been admitted before and kind of collate them to show people as a window into these self-appointed folks that are running our planet and our world.
[00:19:28.905 --> 00:19:32.666]  So here's a few clips from Biden's State of the Union that I wanted to take over.
[00:19:32.706 --> 00:19:35.167]  He'll have a lot more in the latest on the situation.
[00:19:35.866 --> 00:19:37.866]  in Russia.
[00:19:37.866 --> 00:19:41.866]   They're also now firing lead conductors and people in Germany.
[00:19:41.866 --> 00:19:45.866]   If they don't pledge allegiance to NATO and the New World Order,
[00:19:45.866 --> 00:19:49.866]   they're now engaging in even higher levels of censorship around the world.
[00:19:49.866 --> 00:19:51.866]  The first casualty of war is the truth.
[00:19:51.866 --> 00:19:52.866]  The next thing is people.
[00:19:52.866 --> 00:19:54.866]  The next thing is your freedom.
[00:19:54.866 --> 00:19:56.866]   It's more important than ever to spread the word about it in full wars
[00:19:56.866 --> 00:19:58.866]  because you can't take this place for granted.
[00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:01.866]   The only reason we're still on the air is because of all of you.
[00:20:01.311 --> 00:20:03.312]  The only reason we're going to stay on air is because of all of you.
[00:20:03.332 --> 00:20:06.635]  But that's up to God right now and that's also up to you taking action.
[00:20:06.675 --> 00:20:08.877]  So here's a few clips from last night and then I'll take over.
[00:20:08.897 --> 00:20:16.643]  Because you can't build a wall high enough to keep out a vaccine.
[00:20:16.703 --> 00:20:20.746]  The vaccine can stop the spread of these diseases.
[00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:24.369]  Investigating crime prevention and community policing.
[00:20:25.325 --> 00:20:30.467]  Cops who walk the beat, who know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.
[00:20:31.387 --> 00:20:35.829]  Let's not abandon our streets or choose between safety and equal justice.
[00:20:36.649 --> 00:20:41.511]  Let's come together and protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.
[00:20:42.251 --> 00:20:49.434]  That's why the Justice Department has required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knocks warrants for its officers.
[00:20:50.214 --> 00:20:57.814]   That's why the American Rescue Plan that you all provided $350 billion that cities, states, and
[00:20:57.814 --> 00:21:04.374]   counties can use to hire more police, invest in more proven strategies.
[00:21:04.374 --> 00:21:06.374]  (Applause)
[00:21:06.374 --> 00:21:18.053]   Proven strategies like community violence interruption, trusted messengers, breaking
[00:21:18.053 --> 00:21:21.573]   the cycle of violence and trauma and giving young people some hope.
[00:21:21.573 --> 00:21:31.574]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:21:22.793 --> 00:21:25.614]  We should all agree the answer is not to defund the police.
[00:21:26.555 --> 00:21:27.935]  It's to fund the police.
[00:21:30.156 --> 00:21:30.697]  Fund them.
[00:21:32.597 --> 00:21:34.597]  Fund them.
[00:21:34.597 --> 00:21:38.597]  [Applause]
[00:21:38.597 --> 00:21:41.956]   Any president for half a century is under attack as never before.
[00:21:41.967 --> 00:21:56.313]  If you want to go forward, not backwards, you must protect access to health care, preserve a woman's right to choose, and continue to advance maternal health care for all of America.
[00:21:58.556 --> 00:22:05.741]  For our LGBTQ plus Americans, let's finally get the Bipartisan Equality Act to my desk.
[00:22:06.982 --> 00:22:11.285]  The onslaught of state law is targeting transgender Americans and their families.
[00:22:12.185 --> 00:22:13.186]  It's simply wrong.
[00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:23.613]  I've said last year, especially to our younger transgender Americans, I'll always have your back as your president so you can be yourself and reach your God-given potential.
[00:22:25.555 --> 00:22:29.098]   Folks, ...faced in Afghanistan, faced many dangers.
[00:22:29.979 --> 00:22:34.041]  One being stationed at bases breathing in toxic smoke from burn pits.
[00:22:36.542 --> 00:22:37.582]  Many of you have been there.
[00:22:38.603 --> 00:22:39.383]  I've been in and out of Iraq.
[00:22:39.784 --> 00:22:50.329]  To all Americans, I'll be honest with you, as I always promised I would be, a Russian dictator invading a foreign country has cost around the world.
[00:22:51.786 --> 00:22:56.771]  And I'm taking robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russian economy.
[00:22:57.612 --> 00:23:01.896]  And that we use every tool at our disposal to protect American businesses and consumers.
[00:23:01.916 --> 00:23:07.781]  Putin may circle Kiev with tanks, but he'll never gain the hearts and souls of the Iranian people.
[00:23:08.722 --> 00:23:11.165]  He'll never, he'll never extinguish their love of freedom.
[00:23:12.032 --> 00:23:16.032]   and he will never, never weaken the resolve of the free world.
[00:23:16.032 --> 00:23:20.032]  One America, the United States of America!
[00:23:20.032 --> 00:23:24.032]  God bless you all, and may God protect our troops.
[00:23:24.032 --> 00:23:26.032]  Thank you.
[00:23:26.032 --> 00:23:28.032]  Go get him.
[00:23:28.032 --> 00:23:35.032]  [applause]
[00:23:35.032 --> 00:23:37.032]  Okay, uh, the speech is about to begin.
[00:23:36.729 --> 00:23:40.710]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have more from this, more analysis, more breakdown.
[00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:43.951]  I've got updates out of Ukraine.
[00:23:44.111 --> 00:23:45.611]  We've got vaccine updates.
[00:23:46.812 --> 00:23:56.215]  And we're working on getting doctors and lawyers on to respond to the information that we got yesterday with the release of the Pfizer data in their first round of testing that they tried to cover up.
[00:23:56.555 --> 00:23:58.216]  They didn't want it released for about 100 years.
[00:23:58.396 --> 00:23:58.916]  Now we know why.
[00:24:00.202 --> 00:24:11.008]  Ladies and gentlemen, though, I gotta tell you, when I'm doing six hours of radio and television transmissions a day, my go-to is the InfoWars coffee.
[00:24:11.708 --> 00:24:12.989]  And we've got a fresh brew here.
[00:24:13.929 --> 00:24:14.650]  The crew loves it.
[00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:17.851]  The crew that works ten-plus hours a day loves it.
[00:24:18.612 --> 00:24:22.694]  The taste is the best that you're gonna get in coffee, from my experience.
[00:24:22.814 --> 00:24:25.255]  It's the Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee.
[00:24:25.355 --> 00:24:27.196]  It's at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:24:27.596 --> 00:24:28.417]  Fully organic.
[00:24:29.062 --> 00:24:29.763]  You're going to love it.
[00:24:29.843 --> 00:24:30.583]  We love it here.
[00:24:30.743 --> 00:24:31.764]  I'm drinking it today.
[00:24:33.505 --> 00:24:36.868]  And if you're a coffee drinker, give it the test.
[00:24:37.628 --> 00:24:38.269]  Give it the test.
[00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:41.851]  You may be a coffee snob, and you may say, no, I have the best coffee.
[00:24:41.931 --> 00:24:42.732]  I know the best coffee.
[00:24:43.172 --> 00:24:46.574]  Give Patriot Blend from InfoWarsStore.com a chance.
[00:24:46.895 --> 00:24:52.078]  You'll be supporting the InfoWar, keeping us on the air, and I'm telling you, you're going to love this coffee.
[00:24:52.519 --> 00:24:54.080]  For most, it ends up being their favorite.
[00:24:55.031 --> 00:24:59.154]  Well, it was pretty obvious last night that Nancy Pelosi was high.
[00:25:00.275 --> 00:25:03.318]  She was high on her own arrogance.
[00:25:03.538 --> 00:25:07.381]  She was high on her exorbitant wealth and power.
[00:25:08.582 --> 00:25:19.208]   And then whatever pills or booze As well, that made her act like a total dingbat clown last night behind Joe Biden at the State of the Union.
[00:25:19.248 --> 00:25:21.089]  Boy, oh boy, was she full of herself.
[00:25:21.469 --> 00:25:23.190]  Boy, oh boy, was she feeling herself.
[00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:29.112]  And boy, oh boy, was she an embarrassment to this country just as much as Biden was.
[00:25:29.252 --> 00:25:33.293]  And then you had Kamala Harris sitting on the other side, blending in with the chair.
[00:25:33.413 --> 00:25:39.355]  That was an interesting decision for her to go with the, I'm going to, I'm going to try to look like the leather chair behind me and just blend in.
[00:25:39.935 --> 00:25:41.276]  And then mouthing off.
[00:25:42.714 --> 00:25:49.319]  Every time Biden would make a clear mistake, either he would say the wrong thing or he'd stumble or he'd forget where he was at.
[00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:51.661]  Happened about a dozen times last night.
[00:25:52.581 --> 00:25:58.225]  And she would always either have a smirk or a snicker or she'd say something under her breath and you could see her lips moving.
[00:25:58.826 --> 00:26:08.233]  Like when Biden said that he's with the Iranian people, the hearts and souls of the Iranian people.
[00:26:08.873 --> 00:26:10.935]  And you saw her go, uh, Ukraine.
[00:26:12.735 --> 00:26:13.796]  Yeah, that's your president.
[00:26:15.077 --> 00:26:18.680]  So Pelosi went with the higher-than-a-kite pill head look.
[00:26:20.721 --> 00:26:25.244]  And Kamala went with the I'm-gonna-blend-in-with-the-brown-leather-chair look.
[00:26:27.226 --> 00:26:32.109]  And we'll have a little fun with that later, coming up with some of the memes that are coming out.
[00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:42.358]   But let's start to get in here to the aftermath, if you will, of Last night's State of the Union.
[00:26:42.558 --> 00:26:47.499]  Now, I will say two things out of the gates.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:53.781]  One, I was surprised that Biden was able to make it an hour.
[00:26:53.961 --> 00:26:54.982]  That was surprising to me.
[00:26:56.562 --> 00:26:59.443]  Now, it's pathetic that we sit here and say, wow, Biden made it an hour?
[00:26:59.643 --> 00:27:00.484]  Hey, that's not bad.
[00:27:01.724 --> 00:27:09.947]  That's the real State of the Union, that our president is such a joke that he can go for an hour on a live speech and we consider that impressive.
[00:27:11.085 --> 00:27:14.868]  And we commemorate that as, all right, Biden went for an hour.
[00:27:15.209 --> 00:27:16.750]  He only stumbled 12 times.
[00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:18.651]  He only said the wrong thing 12 times.
[00:27:20.033 --> 00:27:23.155]  And then not to mention the full blown clown world aspect.
[00:27:23.435 --> 00:27:29.680]  Folks, I went from about 15 minutes in, many of you may have had the same experience if you were watching live.
[00:27:30.781 --> 00:27:43.531]   I went from about 15 minutes in being just enraged, listening to Biden speak to Just turning into absolute hilarity.
[00:27:43.571 --> 00:27:45.492]  I mean, I'm rolling on the floor laughing.
[00:27:45.572 --> 00:27:46.853]  I mean, belly laughter.
[00:27:49.634 --> 00:27:54.236]  Democrats standing ovation for fund the police.
[00:27:54.756 --> 00:27:56.017]  I mean, come on, man.
[00:27:56.697 --> 00:27:58.038]  That's hilarious.
[00:27:59.118 --> 00:28:00.019]  That's hilarious.
[00:28:00.059 --> 00:28:03.860]  But before I get to the video clips again, let's just look at some of the news.
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:09.763]  Now, the first 10 to 15 minutes of the State of the Union was dedicated to Ukraine.
[00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:20.886]  And I'm really surprised that there's not more of a backlash for what Biden did in his opening frames last night.
[00:28:21.827 --> 00:28:23.129]  Because the way I saw it.
[00:28:24.685 --> 00:28:31.190]  Joe Biden essentially declared war on Russia in his first 10 minutes of that State of the Union.
[00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.633]  I mean, the first 10 to 15 minutes were dedicated to Ukraine-Russia situation.
[00:28:35.673 --> 00:28:43.879]  So, I mean, we're talking about a quarter of the State of the Union was dedicated to completely different countries across the planet and continents, not even about our country.
[00:28:44.479 --> 00:28:46.241]  But see, it's all about making everything about...
[00:28:47.624 --> 00:28:56.367]  Oh, we have to get involved in everything, and Western-backed elites have to get rich off everything, and they gotta power broke everything, and so that's what you need to be concerned about.
[00:28:56.727 --> 00:28:58.787]  No, that's not what the American people are concerned about.
[00:28:59.908 --> 00:29:04.849]  Only the most brainwashed NPCs that put on the badge of whatever the latest thing is.
[00:29:06.189 --> 00:29:08.150]  It's becoming more and more prevalent every day.
[00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:18.212]   How does Joe Biden get away With, essentially, unofficially declaring war on Russia at the State of the Union last night.
[00:29:18.613 --> 00:29:19.853]  How does he get away with that?
[00:29:20.133 --> 00:29:21.554]  How does the media ignore that?
[00:29:26.096 --> 00:29:31.639]  They say Putin's a strong man, and Biden's up there a weak man, saying Putin must pay the price.
[00:29:31.959 --> 00:29:32.779]  He's a dictator.
[00:29:32.819 --> 00:29:33.760]  He's the bad guy.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:35.000]  He's doing war crimes.
[00:29:36.581 --> 00:29:38.862]  He'll face the full assault of the U.S.
[00:29:38.902 --> 00:29:39.362]  military.
[00:29:39.422 --> 00:29:40.883]  He'll face the full strength.
[00:29:43.444 --> 00:29:44.204]  He says the U.S.
[00:29:44.244 --> 00:29:47.025]  is going to block airspace to Russian flights.
[00:29:47.365 --> 00:29:49.626]  He says they're going to confiscate Russians' property.
[00:29:49.686 --> 00:29:51.286]  He's going to go after the oligarchs.
[00:29:51.626 --> 00:29:53.507]  He's going to give more money in arms to Ukraine.
[00:29:53.847 --> 00:30:00.589]  I mean, aside from just saying, I declare war on Russia, he pretty much declared war on Russia.
[00:30:00.609 --> 00:30:01.929]  I mean, that's big.
[00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:08.491]  So I told the crew, I was like, hey, today's headline is Biden unofficially declares war on Russia.
[00:30:09.091 --> 00:30:10.332]  And he did it at the State of the Union.
[00:30:10.552 --> 00:30:11.312]  Now, here's the thing.
[00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:21.739]  The first 15 minutes of last night's State of the Union, let's say it was a speech and let's say it was a good speech.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:26.243]  That speech should have been given two weeks ago.
[00:30:28.605 --> 00:30:32.448]  Two weeks ago is when Biden should have delivered that speech, not last night.
[00:30:35.131 --> 00:30:36.192]  You want to do that speech?
[00:30:36.232 --> 00:30:37.693]  You want to act tough to Putin?
[00:30:37.713 --> 00:30:41.706]   You want to Give big rhetoric, you want to do these things to Russia?
[00:30:42.066 --> 00:30:43.587]  You did it two weeks ago!
[00:30:44.468 --> 00:30:45.448]  Not last night!
[00:30:45.869 --> 00:30:56.676]  So you're two weeks late on your speech, and everything you said is pretty much irrelevant, because it's essentially a bluff, and Putin's already called your bluff.
[00:30:58.658 --> 00:31:06.005]   You give that speech two weeks ago, then it's got some teeth, Then it's got some momentum.
[00:31:06.325 --> 00:31:11.649]  You give that speech two weeks late at the State of the Union, you look like a jackass.
[00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:13.951]  And that's what it was.
[00:31:14.811 --> 00:31:18.154]  So Biden unofficially declares war on Russia during the State of the Union.
[00:31:18.754 --> 00:31:20.095]  Are we going to have follow-up from the media?
[00:31:20.276 --> 00:31:23.038]  Is anybody going to ask Jen Psaki, are we at war with Russia?
[00:31:23.258 --> 00:31:28.602]  Are we mobilizing the troops with all the big threats and all the big talk that Joe Biden made last night?
[00:31:31.966 --> 00:31:33.267]  Are we starting a war with Russia?
[00:31:33.347 --> 00:31:36.429]  Are we getting into a nuclear confrontation with Russia?
[00:31:36.489 --> 00:31:37.430]  Is that actually happening?
[00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.673]  Is Biden actually going to seize property from Russians?
[00:31:40.953 --> 00:31:41.773]  How's he going to do that?
[00:31:41.954 --> 00:31:43.355]  Is he going to send the military in?
[00:31:43.855 --> 00:31:44.856]  See, that's what I'm saying.
[00:31:45.496 --> 00:31:53.082]  Even the media that drools over Joe Biden can't even ask legitimate questions.
[00:31:53.722 --> 00:31:56.584]  How are you going to confiscate Russians' property?
[00:31:56.925 --> 00:31:58.406]  How are you going to make Putin pay?
[00:32:01.892 --> 00:32:11.259]  So Biden puffs up his chest like he's giving a wartime speech, unofficially declares war on Russia, and it's just like, oh, it was so great!
[00:32:11.779 --> 00:32:12.740]  Oh my gosh!
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.261]  Oh, I'm just so moved!
[00:32:16.162 --> 00:32:17.903]  But see, it's all hollow.
[00:32:19.164 --> 00:32:20.345]  It's all empty words.
[00:32:21.146 --> 00:32:29.652]  And even the American media that loves Biden so much admits that today by not making a bigger deal over the fact he basically unofficially declared war with Russia last night.
[00:32:29.692 --> 00:32:44.221]   So this is Biden Just flapping his gums, threatening Russia, threatening Putin, all hollow, all empty, just to act like a tough guy in the State of the Union, with a speech that's two weeks too late.
[00:32:45.582 --> 00:32:52.165]  It's almost as if someone wrote that speech from two weeks ago, and he just couldn't hack it, so they just included it in last night's State of the Union.
[00:32:53.926 --> 00:32:55.527]  You make that speech two weeks ago?
[00:32:55.827 --> 00:32:56.247]  Okay!
[00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:58.729]  You make that speech last night?
[00:33:02.059 --> 00:33:03.320]  Doesn't go over too well.
[00:33:05.141 --> 00:33:10.283]  And how do you think, if Putin's even paying attention, how do you think that's going to make Vladimir Putin respond?
[00:33:10.323 --> 00:33:12.104]  How do you think that's going to make Russia respond?
[00:33:12.124 --> 00:33:17.247]  Do you think that's going to lower the temperature in the room, or do you think that's going to ramp it up?
[00:33:17.747 --> 00:33:20.288]  You know, they claim that Putin's this mad man out of his mind.
[00:33:20.628 --> 00:33:27.252]  Well, how do you think saber rattling like that, how do you think that's going to make Putin feel as he bears down on Ukraine?
[00:33:31.007 --> 00:33:37.189]  Folks, there's still a lot of questions that remain because at the end of the day, there's things that just do not add up.
[00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:51.674]  There are things that just do not add up and there are observations that nobody else seems to be making and it's almost like it's the thing where you can't find the thing that's right in front of your face.
[00:33:51.854 --> 00:33:52.694]  You ever had that happen?
[00:33:52.774 --> 00:33:54.735]  You think something's lost and it's just right there in front of you.
[00:33:54.755 --> 00:33:55.775]  You're like, that was there the whole time?
[00:33:57.515 --> 00:34:01.017]  Some of these things that are going on in Ukraine just don't make any sense.
[00:34:01.357 --> 00:34:06.219]  And when you look at it and you see it, you're like, oh yeah, how come that's happening?
[00:34:06.239 --> 00:34:12.042]  But I'm going to continue with the response to the State of the Union and go through the rest of these stories.
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.642]  But wow, I mean, worst state of the union in U.S.
[00:34:15.682 --> 00:34:16.063]  history?
[00:34:16.924 --> 00:34:18.305]  Unless it was a comedy act.
[00:34:18.605 --> 00:34:22.349]  I mean, the last half an hour of that thing was just straight comedy.
[00:34:22.709 --> 00:34:24.691]  We've been talking about defunding the police.
[00:34:24.872 --> 00:34:33.921]  There's some issues that we ask police to do, like mental health issues or policing in schools and all the rest, that perhaps we can shuffle some of that money around.
[00:34:34.361 --> 00:34:36.323]  I applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what he's done.
[00:34:36.143 --> 00:34:38.143]  We need to defund the police.
[00:34:38.143 --> 00:34:42.643]   Mayor Eric Garcetti saying, "Take some of the money from policing, about $150 million."
[00:34:42.643 --> 00:34:45.143]  I applaud Eric Garcetti for doing what he's done.
[00:34:45.143 --> 00:34:52.271]   Not only do we need to disinvest for in police, but we need to completely dismantle the Minneapolis Police
[00:34:52.271 --> 00:34:53.143]  Department.
[00:34:53.143 --> 00:34:56.143]  So yes, defund your butts. Defund you.
[00:34:56.143 --> 00:35:01.143]  Yes, I support the reallocation of resources from NYPD.
[00:35:01.532 --> 00:35:07.138]  We will be moving funding from the NYPD to youth initiatives and social services.
[00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:16.928]   They are talking about reducing the allocation of resources to that department and I think every single Every city in this country ought to be thinking about the same thing.
[00:35:16.988 --> 00:35:18.788]  Yes, I support the defund movement.
[00:35:18.888 --> 00:35:22.650]  I'm for responsible reallocation of resources.
[00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:23.630]  And defund the police.
[00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:27.451]  I think you do all those other things, you don't need all the money that's going to the police department.
[00:35:27.491 --> 00:35:30.612]  So yeah, I mean, the spirit of it, I do support that.
[00:35:30.732 --> 00:35:37.034]  Yeah, and you know, a lot of us were asked if we could imagine a future without police back in 2017 when we were running for office.
[00:35:37.694 --> 00:35:39.195]  And I answered yes to that question.
[00:35:39.215 --> 00:35:43.699]  We are going to reduce funding in the police department and redirect that money.
[00:35:43.859 --> 00:35:48.042]  There's no reason the police budget should just keep growing and growing and growing.
[00:35:48.062 --> 00:35:50.764]  They can make sensible cuts to police.
[00:35:50.884 --> 00:35:55.027]  We propose to redirect over $7 million from the police bureau.
[00:35:55.287 --> 00:36:02.433]  That our city, through our city administrative officer, identified 250 million dollars in cuts.
[00:36:02.633 --> 00:36:07.537]  Rashida Tlaib tweeting, no more policing, incarceration and militarization, it can't be reformed.
[00:36:07.617 --> 00:36:10.680]  When they're saying defund the police, what are they saying?
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:16.745]  They're saying we want fundamental, basic change when it comes to policing.
[00:36:18.862 --> 00:36:19.742]  And they're right.
[00:36:20.023 --> 00:36:21.684]  We are reallocating funds.
[00:36:22.104 --> 00:36:27.168]  The police department here in Minneapolis needs to be dismantled and we need to start anew.
[00:36:27.428 --> 00:36:31.231]  In some necessary cases, completely dismantling those police forces.
[00:36:31.371 --> 00:36:40.838]  Police departments are taking a sizable amount of the budget of a lot of municipalities and other entities.
[00:36:41.538 --> 00:36:50.354]   We need to look at those budgets, pull some of the money back, and invest it We are committed to shifting resources.
[00:36:50.935 --> 00:36:52.500]  Our cause is to defund the police.
[00:36:56.116 --> 00:37:03.423]  To stop investing so much money in this militarized police force and instead invest in the things our community really needs.
[00:37:03.603 --> 00:37:09.669]  Yes, I support a radical reimagining of community safety and public safety.
[00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:13.132]  I do believe that we need to reallocate resources away.
[00:37:13.312 --> 00:37:14.433]  And will this involve cuts?
[00:37:14.873 --> 00:37:15.674]  Yes, of course.
[00:37:16.195 --> 00:37:18.577]  To every department, including the police department.
[00:37:19.097 --> 00:37:23.082]  And so when we dismantle it, we get rid of that cancer.
[00:37:23.242 --> 00:37:26.666]  When we said defund the police, the world woke up.
[00:37:26.966 --> 00:37:39.119]   I really love that Black Lives Matters and other protesters have put this front and center to defund Defunding police means defunding police.
[00:37:39.219 --> 00:37:45.866]  If these reports are accurate, then these proposed cuts to the NYPD budget are a disingenuous illusion.
[00:37:45.966 --> 00:37:47.387]  This is not a victory.
[00:37:47.707 --> 00:37:52.472]  The freshman Democrat adding the fight to defund policing will continue.
[00:37:52.592 --> 00:37:55.235]  We are going to reimagine policing in New York City.
[00:37:55.875 --> 00:38:04.700]  I think the idea of having a police-free future is very aspirational, and I am willing to stand with community members who are asking us to think of that as the goal.
[00:38:04.981 --> 00:38:11.124]  Should we be defunding or dismantling their police departments, such as in Minneapolis and New York?
[00:38:11.184 --> 00:38:12.305]  My answer is yes to that.
[00:38:12.505 --> 00:38:13.906]  We need to be looking at it clearly.
[00:38:14.206 --> 00:38:24.112]  Which means reallocating, and not further invest... ...going through a process of dismantling...
[00:38:24.659 --> 00:38:33.464]  Investigating crime prevention and community policing, cops who walk the beat, who know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.
[00:38:34.385 --> 00:38:38.827]  Let's not abandon our streets or choose between safety and equal justice.
[00:38:39.627 --> 00:38:44.490]  Let's come together and protect our communities, restore trust, and hold law enforcement accountable.
[00:38:45.251 --> 00:38:52.415]  That's why the Justice Department has required body cameras, banned chokeholds, and restricted no-knocks warrants for its officers.
[00:38:53.006 --> 00:39:00.606]   That's why the American Rescue Plan that you all provided, $350 billion that cities, states,
[00:39:00.606 --> 00:39:05.406]   and counties can use to hire more police, invest in more proven strategies.
[00:39:05.406 --> 00:39:11.006]  [Applause]
[00:39:11.006 --> 00:39:17.006]  Proven strategies like...
[00:39:17.199 --> 00:39:24.541]  Proven strategies like community violence interruption, trusted messengers, breaking the cycle of violence and trauma, giving young people some hope.
[00:39:25.781 --> 00:39:28.602]  We should all agree the answer is not to defund the police.
[00:39:29.562 --> 00:39:30.883]  It's to fund the police.
[00:39:33.203 --> 00:39:33.643]  Fund them.
[00:39:35.604 --> 00:39:37.604]  Fund them.
[00:39:37.604 --> 00:39:39.604]  [Applause]
[00:39:39.604 --> 00:39:41.604]  [Applause]
[00:39:41.604 --> 00:39:43.604]  [Applause]
[00:39:43.604 --> 00:39:45.604]  Fund them with resources and training.
[00:39:45.985 --> 00:40:05.393]  Now ladies and gentlemen, you saw a short clip, which is just a compilation of all the Democrats demanding that the police be defunded, and then all the Democrats in the media demanding that police be defunded.
[00:40:05.513 --> 00:40:09.255]  You saw all the riots in the name of defunding the police.
[00:40:11.468 --> 00:40:17.049]  And then last night, Joe Biden goes up there and says, we need to fund the police, fund the police, fund the police.
[00:40:17.529 --> 00:40:35.733]  And the same Democrats that defunded the police, campaigned on defunding the police, engaged in political activism to defund the police, engaged in violence to defund the police, stood and cheered as Joe Biden said, fund the police.
[00:40:38.294 --> 00:40:40.294]  You just can't make this stuff up.
[00:40:40.294 --> 00:40:42.294]  And...
[00:40:42.294 --> 00:40:47.294]  You know, I gotta be honest with you folks.
[00:40:47.294 --> 00:40:57.294]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:40:49.831 --> 00:40:52.412]  It's stuff like that where you're just like, what am I even doing?
[00:40:53.493 --> 00:40:55.854]  These people are such clowns.
[00:40:56.234 --> 00:41:00.997]  These people are such liars and phonies and criminals and crooks.
[00:41:02.437 --> 00:41:03.038]  And you know what?
[00:41:03.358 --> 00:41:07.600]  If America doesn't want to realize that, and the world doesn't want to wake up to that, I mean, you know.
[00:41:08.821 --> 00:41:09.461]  Because here's the thing.
[00:41:10.638 --> 00:41:12.099]  I'm on air six hours yesterday.
[00:41:12.139 --> 00:41:13.100]  I'm ranting and raving.
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.161]  I'm losing my voice.
[00:41:15.002 --> 00:41:15.342]  Why?
[00:41:18.005 --> 00:41:26.632]  Should I be tormenting myself when these people are such unabashed, unmitigated liars, frauds, phonies, crooks, criminals?
[00:41:26.672 --> 00:41:27.833]  I mean, what are we doing here?
[00:41:29.575 --> 00:41:31.597]  How can anybody take these people seriously?
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:36.021]  The whole country should be laughing at this madness.
[00:41:36.542 --> 00:41:46.968]  I mean, last night, like I said, I went from about 15 minutes in of Biden declaring war on Russia unofficially to then everything after that was just unintentional comedic genius.
[00:41:48.348 --> 00:41:52.011]  Democrats standing ovation for funding the police?
[00:41:52.911 --> 00:41:53.211]  What?
[00:41:54.312 --> 00:41:55.393]  This is a joke, right?
[00:41:55.433 --> 00:41:56.553]  This is satire, right?
[00:41:56.593 --> 00:41:59.055]  This is supposed to be funny.
[00:41:59.095 --> 00:42:00.115]  This isn't serious.
[00:42:00.295 --> 00:42:01.176]  Surely he's joking.
[00:42:02.244 --> 00:42:03.025]  Did he write that?
[00:42:03.305 --> 00:42:04.366]  Did someone else write that?
[00:42:06.068 --> 00:42:10.792]  Where's all the media today that called for the police to be defunded for the last five years?
[00:42:11.072 --> 00:42:14.696]  Where are all the Democrats today that called for the police to be defunded the last five years?
[00:42:15.216 --> 00:42:15.677]  Oh, that's right!
[00:42:16.017 --> 00:42:20.601]  They were standing and cheering when Joe Biden said defund the police.
[00:42:20.902 --> 00:42:23.684]  I mean, it's just full-on Twilight Zone now.
[00:42:23.824 --> 00:42:25.406]  It's just full-on Clown World now.
[00:42:27.947 --> 00:42:37.718]  I don't want to sit here and bash my head up against a wall trying to deal with these people when I shouldn't even have to explain what frauds they are.
[00:42:38.018 --> 00:42:40.181]  I shouldn't even have to explain what liars they are.
[00:42:40.461 --> 00:42:42.383]  I shouldn't even have to explain what crooks they are.
[00:42:42.704 --> 00:42:46.167]  They're just doing it broad daylight for everyone to see.
[00:42:47.088 --> 00:42:48.910]  And why should I get so upset?
[00:42:50.506 --> 00:42:57.210]  Why should I bang my head up against the wall trying to explain how corrupt and phony these people are when it's just broad daylight?
[00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:02.493]  It's a sun in the sky without a cloud in the sky there to block it.
[00:43:06.415 --> 00:43:14.480]  But see, the frustration is you realize that under the leadership of these people, we are F-U-C-K-E-D.
[00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:18.142]  And that's the problem.
[00:43:19.827 --> 00:43:20.668]  That's why you get mad.
[00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:28.755]  Because you realize that these people are fire trucking our future right now.
[00:43:31.517 --> 00:43:32.818]  And it's all just a big game.
[00:43:32.878 --> 00:43:42.727]  It's all just, it's all just a big game and they laugh and they act like they're so great as they burn the world down behind them.
[00:43:45.216 --> 00:43:46.557]  So that's what I'm saying.
[00:43:47.558 --> 00:44:06.512]  How do you even respond to such an unmitigated, ridiculous moment of Democrats having a standing ovation for funding the police when for the last five years they've been chanting to defund the police and taking all the actions to defund the police?
[00:44:08.707 --> 00:44:14.929]  And that's just one of the aspects of hypocrisy and irony from last night's State of the Union.
[00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:18.591]  Biden talking about inflation, he caused that.
[00:44:18.891 --> 00:44:23.093]  Biden talking about raising prices and gas prices and energy prices, he caused that.
[00:44:24.853 --> 00:44:27.394]  The crime running rampant in this city, caused by Democrats.
[00:44:29.815 --> 00:44:31.776]  It's just full-on clown world stuff.
[00:44:33.618 --> 00:44:37.080]  So what, so how do I, it's like, how do you even properly deal with that?
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.481]  How do you even properly respond to that?
[00:44:38.541 --> 00:44:39.722]  How do you even properly cover that?
[00:44:39.762 --> 00:44:47.427]  It's like, do I just put on my clown, my clown makeup and nose and wig and just go full clown world and just say, hey, look at how funny this is.
[00:44:48.188 --> 00:44:49.689]  The Democrats are playing pranks.
[00:44:49.769 --> 00:44:50.690]  It's hilarious, isn't it?
[00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.911]  Look, here they are funding the police now.
[00:44:53.792 --> 00:44:58.475]  After for years having riots to defund the police, now they want to fund them.
[00:44:58.555 --> 00:44:59.936]  Oh, look at how funny this is.
[00:45:01.755 --> 00:45:03.196]  Defund the police!
[00:45:04.718 --> 00:45:05.779]  Fund the police!
[00:45:07.781 --> 00:45:08.342]  Defund!
[00:45:08.422 --> 00:45:08.822]  Fund!
[00:45:08.942 --> 00:45:09.483]  Defund!
[00:45:09.563 --> 00:45:09.963]  Fund!
[00:45:13.687 --> 00:45:27.221]   I find myself in the twilight zone asking myself Is it time to just move on from these people?
[00:45:27.241 --> 00:45:29.402]  And what does that look like?
[00:45:30.223 --> 00:45:40.088]  How do you execute that strategy of just putting these demons, putting these con men, putting these liars and frauds and crooks behind you?
[00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:41.069]  How do we do that?
[00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:45.071]  It's like, I just can't deal with these people anymore.
[00:45:48.693 --> 00:45:49.454]  What's the answer to that?
[00:45:54.271 --> 00:46:02.879]  How long do we have to intellectually, philosophically, politically battle with these monsters?
[00:46:02.999 --> 00:46:04.380]  Is victory even possible?
[00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:10.966]  Or is the victory just separating yourself from these monsters, cutting them out of your life?
[00:46:10.986 --> 00:46:13.608]  Like, I don't even want to see Nancy Pelosi.
[00:46:13.688 --> 00:46:15.169]  I don't even want to see Joe Biden.
[00:46:15.028 --> 00:46:16.829]  I don't even want to see a politician.
[00:46:16.829 --> 00:46:25.028]  You know what I mean?
[00:46:25.028 --> 00:46:27.367]  (footsteps)
[00:46:27.367 --> 00:46:28.367]   *thud* *thud*
[00:46:28.898 --> 00:46:32.220]  I mean, because there's just, there's no covers, there's no response.
[00:46:32.821 --> 00:46:33.861]  There's no commentary.
[00:46:36.083 --> 00:46:37.885]  It's just total...
[00:46:40.239 --> 00:46:40.959]  Corruption.
[00:46:41.540 --> 00:46:42.661]  Total phonyism.
[00:46:43.541 --> 00:46:44.121]  So that's what I'm saying.
[00:46:44.141 --> 00:46:49.925]  It's like, now I'm sitting here spinning my wheels like, oh, how do I properly cover how fake the Democrats are?
[00:46:50.125 --> 00:46:51.946]  How do I properly cover how big of liars they are?
[00:46:52.547 --> 00:46:54.288]  How do I properly cover how dangerous this is?
[00:46:55.228 --> 00:46:56.169]  How do I properly cover this?
[00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.749]  I'll figure it out.
[00:46:56.889 --> 00:46:57.890]  Like, what's the skeleton key?
[00:46:59.571 --> 00:47:00.451]  What's Pandora's box?
[00:47:00.471 --> 00:47:00.932]  How do we do this?
[00:47:01.092 --> 00:47:01.712]  How do we beat these people?
[00:47:01.832 --> 00:47:04.874]  Like sprinting, sprinting, sprinting, churning, churning, churning.
[00:47:05.855 --> 00:47:06.775]  And then you just stop.
[00:47:07.816 --> 00:47:13.792]   And you catch your breath and you're just like, Why am I even dealing with these people?
[00:47:18.476 --> 00:47:33.070]  If you can't see what liars our politicians are, and specifically in this moment in American history, what liars the Democrat Party is, I mean, like, what am I even doing here?
[00:47:33.631 --> 00:47:34.832]  How long do I have to sprint?
[00:47:34.872 --> 00:47:42.459]   How long do I have to run this marathon Putting their absolute phonyism on display.
[00:47:42.479 --> 00:47:45.342]  I mean, is that the greatest example of all time?
[00:47:45.702 --> 00:47:47.224]  How phony the Democrat Party is?
[00:47:47.244 --> 00:47:52.729]  I mean... So it's like, I need to move on.
[00:47:53.209 --> 00:47:54.150]  But it's just unbelievable.
[00:47:56.933 --> 00:47:59.896]  Here are some of the other revelations of last night.
[00:48:01.021 --> 00:48:02.181]  The police should be funded.
[00:48:02.662 --> 00:48:03.942]  So, uh, we were right about that.
[00:48:04.362 --> 00:48:05.903]  Masks are pointless.
[00:48:06.003 --> 00:48:07.043]  Okay, we were right about that.
[00:48:07.503 --> 00:48:08.764]  The border should be secure.
[00:48:08.944 --> 00:48:09.644]  How about that?
[00:48:10.544 --> 00:48:15.426]  Biden goes on a five-minute rant about how we need to secure the southern border!
[00:48:15.446 --> 00:48:17.246]  I mean, what?
[00:48:17.606 --> 00:48:22.148]  Like, seriously, like, when did somebody come in here and slap me with a pie in the face?
[00:48:23.049 --> 00:48:25.670]  It's like, when am I, it's like, am I in a jackass movie or something?
[00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:31.433]  Like, am I gonna walk through the door and then like some big foam hand is gonna like spring-loaded just smack me down?
[00:48:31.493 --> 00:48:32.474]  I mean, is this a joke?
[00:48:32.534 --> 00:48:33.674]  Like, what is going on here?
[00:48:34.315 --> 00:48:35.495]  Are we serious people?
[00:48:39.277 --> 00:48:44.520]  Biden last night talking about how great America is and he wants to build America back great.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.260]  What are you, Donald Trump now?
[00:48:47.821 --> 00:48:49.282]  So now Biden is Donald Trump?
[00:48:50.956 --> 00:48:56.638]  Joe Biden basically gave a campaign speech last night from Donald Trump in 2016.
[00:48:57.038 --> 00:48:58.259]  Law enforcement funding?
[00:48:58.699 --> 00:48:59.639]  Border security?
[00:49:00.019 --> 00:49:01.780]  America the greatest country on earth?
[00:49:04.021 --> 00:49:07.922]  That's Donald Trump's campaign message and I'm up here listening to Biden do it?
[00:49:08.002 --> 00:49:09.963]  Is this a joke?
[00:49:10.083 --> 00:49:11.864]  Are you guys playing a prank on me?
[00:49:16.656 --> 00:49:19.537]  Talks about Big Tech with its experiment on children.
[00:49:19.917 --> 00:49:23.199]  Okay, well, are you going to defund Big Tech?
[00:49:23.639 --> 00:49:24.279]  Of course not!
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:26.680]  Big Tech is their wing of censorship!
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:28.881]  So that's what I'm saying.
[00:49:28.901 --> 00:49:37.845]  It's like, I could sit here and dissect the entire hour of the State of the Union last night and just show all the lies, show all the fraud, show all the hypocrisy.
[00:49:38.666 --> 00:49:40.667]  But it's face value.
[00:49:41.087 --> 00:49:43.628]  Why should I even have to give that effort?
[00:49:44.893 --> 00:49:46.856]  Everybody should understand that now.
[00:49:47.097 --> 00:49:49.416]   Which brings me to a new conclusion I'll talk about when I get back.
[00:49:49.416 --> 00:49:56.417]  [Music]
[00:49:56.417 --> 00:50:03.417]   I stay on air selling high quality products that you need, that you want, and that you're going to be happy with.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:06.362]  That's why you come back and buy products from me again.
[00:50:06.382 --> 00:50:08.104]  It's a symbiotic relationship.
[00:50:08.204 --> 00:50:14.689]  I promote liberty, I promote freedom, I fight the globalists, and I'm able to do that because you buy products at InfoWarsaw.com.
[00:50:15.069 --> 00:50:26.954]  And listen, all the products are great, but when it comes to high-quality storable food in an inflationary system with major supply chain breakdowns, this is an absolute 360 win, a no-brainer.
[00:50:27.454 --> 00:50:30.555]  And they've got high-quality storable food ready to ship to you right now.
[00:50:30.835 --> 00:50:35.397]  The great folks at MyPatreonSupply, exclusively from ParallelX.com, discounted.
[00:50:35.717 --> 00:50:39.199]  So again, beat inflation, be prepared, fund the InfoWar.
[00:50:39.459 --> 00:50:45.783]  The only way you lose is not taking action at InfoWarStore.com or PrepareWithAlex.com right now.
[00:50:46.023 --> 00:50:47.424]  This is high quality, storable food.
[00:50:47.444 --> 00:50:49.064]  This is how you beat inflation.
[00:50:49.425 --> 00:50:50.125]  Get yours today.
[00:50:50.185 --> 00:50:50.946]  It's ready to ship.
[00:50:51.166 --> 00:50:55.028]  But I wouldn't wait because prices are about to go up because inflation is exploding.
[00:50:55.508 --> 00:50:55.728]  All right.
[00:50:55.948 --> 00:51:06.217]   I'm going to put on hold the rest of this stack when it comes to The State of the Union last night, and then I've got just all kinds of news out of Ukraine.
[00:51:07.417 --> 00:51:19.019]  I mean, just a huge news desk today, but I'm going to be on air again for six hours, so I've got plenty of time to do it, so I'm not going to break myself putting the pedal to the metal and not do a proper job covering this.
[00:51:19.059 --> 00:51:25.441]  But I've reached this intellectual blockade dealing with the State of the Union last night just because it's so ridiculous.
[00:51:26.421 --> 00:51:31.162]  So I need to switch lanes real quick just to get the show moving again.
[00:51:33.889 --> 00:51:53.285]  I have begun to contemplate something that is extremely, how would you even say it, existential, esoteric, enigmatic, perhaps insane.
[00:51:55.927 --> 00:52:15.993]   Because, as other headlines have stated today, And I think it was a Fox News headline last night with whoever went on after the State of the Union saying, did we even watch the same State of the Union address?
[00:52:16.834 --> 00:52:22.959]  Talking about, you know, if you want to just go down party lines, Republicans and Democrats are conservatives and liberals.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:27.644]  I hate putting people into boxes like that, but just for the sake of argument here.
[00:52:29.755 --> 00:52:32.856]  Did we watch the same State of the Union last night?
[00:52:33.376 --> 00:52:35.036]  Are we seeing the same thing?
[00:52:35.056 --> 00:52:48.820]  And so I just go deeper into thinking about this, into just the depths of the consciousness and the brain and existence, because it's just, it doesn't make sense.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:50.840]  I mean, I'm totally living in the Twilight Zone.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.421]  Did Democrats and Republicans even watch the same State of the Union?
[00:52:56.874 --> 00:52:58.814]  So I'm just trying to make sense of it all here.
[00:52:59.275 --> 00:53:06.436]  Because I can sound insane with what I'm about to say, and you may think it's insane, and that's perfectly fine.
[00:53:06.816 --> 00:53:09.377]  Did you see how insane the State of the Union was last night?
[00:53:09.597 --> 00:53:11.758]  Did you see how insane the media is?
[00:53:12.338 --> 00:53:14.078]  So I'm not the insane one here.
[00:53:16.319 --> 00:53:24.581]  But you see, remember just the other day how Klaus Schwab talks about hacking a human mind, hacking a human brain?
[00:53:27.369 --> 00:53:28.590]  So I'm just trying to make sense of all this.
[00:53:28.850 --> 00:53:32.453]  Maybe we are in a simulation and all of our minds have already been hacked.
[00:53:34.314 --> 00:53:39.598]  Because there is no way in hell that we all saw the same State of the Union last night.
[00:53:39.698 --> 00:53:42.360]  There is just no way.
[00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.161]  This doesn't make any sense to me.
[00:53:44.281 --> 00:53:46.523]  There is no logical explanation.
[00:53:46.543 --> 00:54:05.647]   I mean, unless it's just Democrats are just 100% mentally ill Committed to their pathological lies, committed to their phonyism, and just do this as some big prank over you, like gaslighting you, because they get off on it.
[00:54:07.929 --> 00:54:11.151]  Or, as Klaus Schwab said, have our minds already been hacked?
[00:54:12.552 --> 00:54:17.895]  Are we even seeing and hearing and experiencing the same consciousness?
[00:54:19.436 --> 00:54:21.357]  It doesn't feel that way anymore.
[00:54:22.698 --> 00:54:23.779]  Here's a couple other examples.
[00:54:25.854 --> 00:54:35.338]  Last night, Jill Biden wears this hideous dress coat thing last night that looks like it's a cross between a leopard and a zebra.
[00:54:35.358 --> 00:54:36.239]  I mean, it's hideous!
[00:54:36.279 --> 00:54:37.159]  It's disgusting!
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:38.960]  But okay, whatever.
[00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:39.900]  She can wear what she wants.
[00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:40.621]  I don't really care.
[00:54:41.801 --> 00:54:43.982]  And then it's just the left just drooling.
[00:54:44.002 --> 00:54:45.663]  Oh my gosh!
[00:54:46.203 --> 00:54:48.824]  Finally, a first lady with some fashion sense!
[00:54:49.165 --> 00:54:52.046]  Finally, a first lady that knows how to dress and look like a lady!
[00:54:53.399 --> 00:55:00.944]  And then they talk about how, how come Hillary Clinton and Jill Biden and Michelle Obama know how to dress and they're so fashionable?
[00:55:01.504 --> 00:55:04.266]  And it's just like, did you see?
[00:55:06.407 --> 00:55:07.208]  Who are you?
[00:55:07.408 --> 00:55:07.728]  What?
[00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:11.070]  Hillary Clinton fashionable?
[00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:13.051]  She looks like a vacuum cleaner.
[00:55:13.252 --> 00:55:14.813]  She looks like Mao Zedong.
[00:55:18.015 --> 00:55:24.405]   Michelle Obama with her bulging shoulders and her bulging Bulge?
[00:55:26.807 --> 00:55:27.447]  Jill Biden?
[00:55:27.487 --> 00:55:28.828]  Like 101 Dalmatians?
[00:55:28.848 --> 00:55:37.193]  And they're like, oh, thank God somebody fashionable and ladylike and classy and graceful is back in the White House.
[00:55:37.853 --> 00:55:38.974]  Fake Dr. Jill?
[00:55:39.314 --> 00:55:41.655]  Who would actually describe her as graceful?
[00:55:42.215 --> 00:55:44.657]  Who would actually describe her as fashionable?
[00:55:46.792 --> 00:55:50.374]  And then it's literally Melania Trump, fashion icon.
[00:55:50.394 --> 00:55:56.238]  I mean, when it comes to taste and class and grace, Melania Trump is like A++++.
[00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:17.826]   If you could find a neutral observer and put Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Jill Biden and Melania Trump in front of a group of Neutral observers who have no dog in the fight and don't know anything about this, and you say, who's the fashionable one?
[00:56:18.447 --> 00:56:21.649]  Every single one of them would say Melania Trump and it wouldn't even be close.
[00:56:23.411 --> 00:56:25.192]  Hillary Clinton looks like a dead dog.
[00:56:26.093 --> 00:56:29.155]  Jill Biden looks like the dead dog's starving cousin.
[00:56:30.316 --> 00:56:32.238]  And Michelle Obama looks like Michael Obama.
[00:56:33.413 --> 00:56:40.358]  And then Melania Trump, supermodel, fashion icon, and they say, oh, thank God, grace and class.
[00:56:40.398 --> 00:56:43.360]  It's like, we're not even seeing the same thing.
[00:56:45.061 --> 00:56:46.902]  I don't see the same world as a liberal.
[00:56:47.062 --> 00:56:48.303]  There is just no way.
[00:56:49.684 --> 00:56:50.565]  Here's another example.
[00:56:52.466 --> 00:57:07.450]  I mean, it's like Melania Trump, like hottest woman on earth, and then it's raggedy, fake Dr. Jill Biden, and wet, dead dog Hillary Clinton, and man-shell Obama, and they think that that's grace and class and femininity compared to Melania Trump.
[00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:08.591]  I mean, are you kidding me?
[00:57:09.471 --> 00:57:11.032]  We must not be seeing the same reality.
[00:57:11.432 --> 00:57:12.372]  Here's another example.
[00:57:13.472 --> 00:57:18.954]  Remember when Joe Rogan was being criticized because he beat COVID in three days?
[00:57:20.262 --> 00:57:25.805]  And he doesn't have the deadly vaccine juice in him.
[00:57:26.846 --> 00:57:30.608]  And he took ivermectin and all these other things and he recovered from COVID in like three days.
[00:57:31.389 --> 00:57:33.310]  And how pissed off the left was at that.
[00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:37.472]  And they said, Oh, like I'm going to take health advice from this guy.
[00:57:37.492 --> 00:57:43.676]  And then it was this, uh, this creepo, Ethan Klein.
[00:57:45.089 --> 00:57:48.290]  Who starts ridiculing and then people start comparing Ethan Klein to Joe Rogan.
[00:57:48.750 --> 00:57:53.811]  Ethan Klein looks like he hasn't passed by a donut shop in his life.
[00:57:55.232 --> 00:57:59.713]  Ethan Klein looks like he couldn't do a single push-up or pull-up or sit-up.
[00:57:59.973 --> 00:58:00.873]  Not a single one.
[00:58:01.173 --> 00:58:02.214]  His gut would get in the way.
[00:58:04.634 --> 00:58:06.015]  And then Joe Rogan is like...
[00:58:06.929 --> 00:58:08.290]  I mean, I think he's like 50 years old.
[00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:17.055]  He's got like six-pack abs, jacked arms, jacked chest, does yoga, you know, black belt, jiu-jitsu, and all this other stuff.
[00:58:17.995 --> 00:58:24.018]  And you just compare the two and it's like, who sees Ethan Klein as somebody that's healthier than Joe Rogan?
[00:58:24.459 --> 00:58:26.380]  We can't be living in the same reality.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.821]  This cannot be.
[00:58:29.921 --> 00:58:32.383]  You're not seeing the same thing I'm seeing, right?
[00:58:32.423 --> 00:58:36.065]  I mean, so, have our minds already been hacked?
[00:58:37.682 --> 00:58:55.410]  Or is it true that liberal progressive Democrats are just fully committed lying scumbags that get off on lying to you and get off on twisting reality and it's like some weird game to them.
[00:58:56.911 --> 00:59:00.032]  Look, I don't really care what Ethan Klein wants to do with his body.
[00:59:00.933 --> 00:59:01.873]  It's none of my business.
[00:59:01.913 --> 00:59:05.315]  If Ethan Klein wants to be a fat ass out of shape, he has every right to be.
[00:59:07.256 --> 00:59:19.142]  But let's not kid ourselves and pretend like some jelly donut human is in better shape and is more health conscious than Joe Rogan.
[00:59:19.402 --> 00:59:20.322]  I mean, that's a joke.
[00:59:21.183 --> 00:59:29.947]  Joe Rogan, who's in the top level gyms, top level Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, top level supplement products, works with top doctors, top trainers.
[00:59:31.963 --> 00:59:43.270]  And then it's Ethan Klein, who's probably five years away from needing a bra and a girdle just to fit through a door.
[00:59:45.951 --> 00:59:48.993]  And they say, oh, Ethan Klein is so much healthier than Joe Rogan.
[00:59:49.233 --> 00:59:50.774]  We can't live in the same reality.
[00:59:50.974 --> 00:59:52.735]  There's no way we're seeing the same thing.
[00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:54.256]  Something has gone horribly wrong here.
[00:59:58.382 --> 01:00:01.305]  So, these are like aliens or something?
[01:00:01.405 --> 01:00:03.086]  Or they're possessed by demons?
[01:00:03.466 --> 01:00:09.091]  Or maybe they're not even human and they're like avatars for an alien space suit?
[01:00:10.392 --> 01:00:11.493]  Like in Mars Attacks?
[01:00:11.574 --> 01:00:13.375]  Or they live or under the skin?
[01:00:13.976 --> 01:00:16.538]  Because these people just, they do not live in reality.
[01:00:17.359 --> 01:00:18.900]  They're intentionally lying to you.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:21.983]  Or somehow our minds have already been hacked.
[01:00:23.221 --> 01:00:25.803]  And we just don't even see the same thing.
[01:00:26.643 --> 01:00:31.426]  We are not even seeing the same reality, because it doesn't make sense.
[01:00:32.187 --> 01:00:33.407]  Something is wrong here.
[01:00:34.668 --> 01:00:36.409]  We're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:36.669 --> 01:00:41.472]  Owen Schroer, filling in for Alex, says he's trying to take a vacation.
[01:00:42.633 --> 01:00:43.553]  You can imagine, though.
[01:00:46.435 --> 01:00:47.656]  It's just insane, man.
[01:00:48.897 --> 01:00:49.977]  It's just all insane.
[01:00:49.997 --> 01:00:57.246]   And so I just need to enter a different intellectual space and energy space right now so that I just don't blow up covering this.
[01:00:58.146 --> 01:00:59.587]  And just accept we're in the clown world.
[01:01:00.628 --> 01:01:05.451]  Just accept this is some sort of demonic or alien takeover because I can't make sense of it any other way.
[01:01:06.211 --> 01:01:13.295]  And just let the left, let the Democrats, let the liberals lie and cheat and steal and just engage in all their chicanery.
[01:01:13.936 --> 01:01:22.001]  And we'll just sit here and watch it and watch these demons take over and just pray to God we get forgiven and see them on the other side.
[01:01:23.217 --> 01:01:29.642]  Because I just can't deal with the insanity of it all anymore and just get all upset.
[01:01:29.722 --> 01:01:32.525]  And have you noticed that Alex has been saying the same thing here lately, too?
[01:01:32.965 --> 01:01:34.186]  It's just so ridiculous.
[01:01:35.187 --> 01:01:36.148]  It's just so insane.
[01:01:36.168 --> 01:01:39.791]  I mean, the Biden crime family gets away with all their crimes, but...
[01:01:41.547 --> 01:01:47.595]  You know, I have the deep state coming after my family that has no criminal record, just nicest people in the world.
[01:01:47.655 --> 01:01:49.737]  You know, veterans on both sides.
[01:01:49.757 --> 01:01:50.758]  It's fine, though.
[01:01:50.839 --> 01:01:51.439]  It's all good.
[01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:57.567]  Let's destroy the Schroer family, but let the Biden crime family just do whatever the hell it wants and run the country and lie to us every day.
[01:01:57.587 --> 01:01:58.348]  Yeah, it's good.
[01:01:58.648 --> 01:01:59.069]  It's a good thing.
[01:02:01.397 --> 01:02:02.337]  So let me just do this.
[01:02:02.497 --> 01:02:06.758]  Let me just play the rest of these clips here and then get into some of the headlines too.
[01:02:07.878 --> 01:02:11.219]  So you had Pelosi, not just with the weird rubbing of the fists.
[01:02:11.539 --> 01:02:13.500]  I don't know if I've ever seen anything like that before.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.701]  Maybe it was a drunken induced, drunken state or pill head state.
[01:02:18.761 --> 01:02:19.341]  I mean, who knows?
[01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:20.901]  That woman was hiring a kite last night.
[01:02:21.301 --> 01:02:22.662]  That was pretty obvious.
[01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:27.843]  She also almost fell over.
[01:02:29.033 --> 01:02:29.834]  Did you see that one?
[01:02:29.854 --> 01:02:31.215]  She almost fell over.
[01:02:31.315 --> 01:02:32.476]  Guys, you can just roll the b-roll here.
[01:02:33.136 --> 01:02:35.438]  So it wasn't just Pelosi looking higher than a cuck.
[01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:38.280]  But, uh, she also almost fell over.
[01:02:39.761 --> 01:02:42.003]  One of the times where she stood up, she almost fell over.
[01:02:43.564 --> 01:02:50.370]  And what was with the... I mean, did she not have, um... What's the name of the glue they put your densers, like Sensodyne or something?
[01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:51.110]  I don't know what it's called.
[01:02:52.551 --> 01:02:52.992]  Fix-A-Dent.
[01:02:53.012 --> 01:02:53.292]  Thank you.
[01:02:55.362 --> 01:03:05.169]  I guess she couldn't find the denture glue last night, or she forgot to put it in because she was so high, or she drank so much it came loose.
[01:03:05.249 --> 01:03:08.771]  I mean, I don't know, but she's back there fiddling with her mouth and her dentures.
[01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:10.112]  I mean, it's a joke.
[01:03:10.393 --> 01:03:16.317]  And she sits up there and just emanating this energy of, I've conquered you.
[01:03:16.817 --> 01:03:18.058]  I dominate you.
[01:03:18.818 --> 01:03:22.321]  Look at how powerful and rich I am up here on the podium.
[01:03:23.502 --> 01:03:25.810]   She's like, That's a demon.
[01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:28.091]  I've seen this before.
[01:03:28.111 --> 01:03:28.651]  That's a demon.
[01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:29.211]  That's a devil.
[01:03:30.192 --> 01:03:31.972]  That's a demon-possessed entity.
[01:03:31.992 --> 01:03:32.512]  What is that?
[01:03:32.572 --> 01:03:33.053]  What is that?
[01:03:34.193 --> 01:03:35.453]  That's a damn demon, man.
[01:03:39.215 --> 01:03:44.997]  So, like, there's one level of this with the fighting human spirit that says, yeah, come after me, demons.
[01:03:45.597 --> 01:03:46.377]  I'm proud of that.
[01:03:47.197 --> 01:03:49.798]  I'm proud that demons want to corrupt me and destroy me.
[01:03:50.699 --> 01:03:51.899]  And I fight them every day.
[01:03:54.011 --> 01:04:09.734]  But then another part of me is just like, I don't want to see these demons, I don't want anything to do with these demons, just get behind me Satan, get in front of me Jesus, and just rid these demons of my life, or show me the way.
[01:04:09.754 --> 01:04:19.555]  I mean, Pelosi was probably one jaw movement away from choking to death on her own dentures last night.
[01:04:22.416 --> 01:04:22.936]  So there's that.
[01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:26.511]  See if you can make sense of this Biden clip.
[01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:28.991]  This is one of dozens of his flummoxes last night.
[01:04:29.512 --> 01:04:32.172]  See if you can make sense of Biden in clip six.
[01:04:32.393 --> 01:04:37.354]  I think that he lost his place on the teleprompter on this one and really fumbled it.
[01:04:38.354 --> 01:04:41.755]  Here he is saying, I'm not really sure what.
[01:04:43.596 --> 01:04:49.598]  Because you can't build a wall high enough to keep out a vaccine.
[01:04:49.678 --> 01:04:53.699]  The vaccine can stop the spread of these diseases.
[01:04:55.211 --> 01:04:57.351]  Did you see Kamala's face behind him, too?
[01:04:57.912 --> 01:04:59.532]  Like, yeah, that's old Joe.
[01:05:00.872 --> 01:05:08.714]  So he was talking about the border being secure, and then somehow talks about vaccines and walls?
[01:05:08.854 --> 01:05:10.934]  I... eugh.
[01:05:12.435 --> 01:05:13.355]  What happened there, Joe?
[01:05:14.515 --> 01:05:15.355]  What happened there?
[01:05:16.016 --> 01:05:17.496]  Here's a little comedic relief.
[01:05:18.942 --> 01:05:25.465]  Joe Biden tried to place the biggest crack pipe order of all time, but I guess that one fell flat.
[01:05:25.805 --> 01:05:28.427]  He wanted to be number one all time in crack pipe purchases.
[01:05:28.847 --> 01:05:33.769]  Instead, he went for the pill purchase and said, here he is bragging about purchasing the most pills ever.
[01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:34.730]  Listen to this in clip seven.
[01:05:37.711 --> 01:05:42.874]  I may circle Kiev with tanks, but I'll never gain the hearts and souls of the Iranian people.
[01:05:43.718 --> 01:05:47.120]  Alright, well that's clip 8, but that's okay, because that one makes no sense too.
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:52.624]  But here guys, let's play him talking about how he's the biggest order of pharma- he's the biggest pill head of all time.
[01:05:52.664 --> 01:05:52.984]  Here we go.
[01:05:57.047 --> 01:05:59.388]  Oh, okay, we got a technical error with that clip.
[01:05:59.608 --> 01:06:00.569]  It's okay, it's okay.
[01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:04.171]  Here, we'll go back, we'll go back here.
[01:06:04.291 --> 01:06:09.775]  Listen to- let's hear him confusing Iran with Ukraine.
[01:06:09.795 --> 01:06:11.216]  That's a big leap there in clip 8.
[01:06:12.739 --> 01:06:17.922]  Putin may circle Kiev with tanks, but he'll never gain the hearts and souls of the Iranian people.
[01:06:18.883 --> 01:06:21.344]  He'll never, he'll never extinguish their love of freedom.
[01:06:21.665 --> 01:06:23.306]  And then again Kamala behind him.
[01:06:23.346 --> 01:06:25.807]  And he will never, never weaken the resolve of the free world.
[01:06:26.268 --> 01:06:26.708]  Oh really?
[01:06:26.768 --> 01:06:30.570]  Like you're trying to do with vaccine mandates and mask mandates and all the other crap?
[01:06:30.991 --> 01:06:31.751]  Yeah, give me a break.
[01:06:33.932 --> 01:06:37.795]  And you can see Kamala behind saying, oh geez, oh not again Joe.
[01:06:38.746 --> 01:06:40.106]  It's pretty much like that the whole speech.
[01:06:40.126 --> 01:06:43.347]  I wonder if there might be a little tongue lashing between those two.
[01:06:44.547 --> 01:06:45.287]  But it's okay.
[01:06:45.307 --> 01:06:46.708]  We can play the pill thing later, guys.
[01:06:47.808 --> 01:06:51.569]  Just Biden bragging about how he's purchased more pills than anybody else all time.
[01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.689]  Interesting flex.
[01:06:54.249 --> 01:06:54.889]  Interesting flex.
[01:06:54.929 --> 01:07:00.770]  Here's a response from Chip Roy, who won in a landslide last night in the Texas primaries.
[01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:03.051]  I've got some other news on that coming up.
[01:07:04.062 --> 01:07:05.303]  Chip Roy is the real deal.
[01:07:05.943 --> 01:07:06.704]  Nobody's perfect.
[01:07:06.864 --> 01:07:09.725]  I've met Chip a couple times, though, but he's the real deal.
[01:07:09.765 --> 01:07:11.747]  He actually cares, and he's getting more hardcore.
[01:07:12.467 --> 01:07:21.973]  This arrogant ass is proclaiming our country open after all he and the Democrats did to our children, our jobs, and all Americans, and Republicans stand up and clap for this crap?
[01:07:23.173 --> 01:07:25.935]  Representative Chip Roy out of Texas.
[01:07:27.316 --> 01:07:28.897]  Again, it's the same Twilight Zone stuff.
[01:07:28.917 --> 01:07:30.878]  The Democrats did all this COVID crap.
[01:07:32.353 --> 01:07:37.096]  And now they're bragging about how it's all over and the mask mandate's lifted and they all stand and cheer.
[01:07:37.156 --> 01:07:40.057]  It's like, you could have done that two years ago.
[01:07:41.658 --> 01:07:43.059]  And so that's what I'm saying.
[01:07:43.119 --> 01:07:44.099]  See, I'm already getting mad.
[01:07:44.119 --> 01:07:45.780]  I'm going to control myself and it's okay.
[01:07:46.441 --> 01:07:49.842]  But I just don't like being lied to.
[01:07:49.882 --> 01:07:51.023]  I don't like being conned.
[01:07:51.663 --> 01:07:52.644]  And I know you don't either.
[01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:57.291]  And it's just non-stop with these Democrats.
[01:07:57.331 --> 01:07:59.613]  It's non-stop with this White House.
[01:08:00.473 --> 01:08:03.675]  He talks about how big corporations are out of control and corrupt.
[01:08:05.236 --> 01:08:07.697]  And how we need competition in the free market.
[01:08:07.978 --> 01:08:08.258]  Really?
[01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:11.720]  Can InfoWars get back on the Google app and the Apple app?
[01:08:12.595 --> 01:08:13.576]  Oh, no, that's right.
[01:08:14.256 --> 01:08:14.776]  That's right.
[01:08:15.036 --> 01:08:16.077]  He doesn't care about that.
[01:08:16.497 --> 01:08:17.518]  Again, just empty words.
[01:08:17.598 --> 01:08:18.358]  Just empty words.
[01:08:18.678 --> 01:08:20.239]  We need competition in the free market.
[01:08:20.559 --> 01:08:22.100]  Oh, so InfoWars can be unbanned?
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.081]  Well, no, I didn't mean actual competition.
[01:08:25.882 --> 01:08:28.784]  At the end of the speech, just randomly, he goes, go get him!
[01:08:30.325 --> 01:08:31.946]  Nobody knows what that was in reference to.
[01:08:32.846 --> 01:08:36.168]  He might as well have said, I like apple pie, or, you know.
[01:08:37.591 --> 01:08:39.113]  Dog-faced pony soldier!
[01:08:39.133 --> 01:08:41.115]  I mean, what are you, a fat ass?
[01:08:41.756 --> 01:08:43.718]  Just another Biden fumble, bumble.
[01:08:46.021 --> 01:08:49.946]  You know, here's the other clip I want to find, if you can find it, and I couldn't find it, but the crew's better at this stuff.
[01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:56.413]  At one point in the time, he goes, it's so great because we made the vaccine free.
[01:08:57.697 --> 01:08:59.861]  Now everyone knows this costs money.
[01:09:02.385 --> 01:09:07.554]  No kidding, he literally said, we made the vaccine free, everyone knows this costs money.
[01:09:08.556 --> 01:09:09.999]  Total clown world.
[01:09:11.428 --> 01:09:14.229]  I've ordered more pills than anyone in the world has.
[01:09:14.249 --> 01:09:20.072]  Pfizer's working overtime to get- I've ordered more pills than anyone in the world has.
[01:09:20.092 --> 01:09:25.915]  Pfizer's working overtime to get- I've ordered more pills than anyone in the world has.
[01:09:26.015 --> 01:09:26.656]  Nice!
[01:09:26.676 --> 01:09:28.857]  Pfizer's working overtime to get- Attaboy, no!
[01:09:28.877 --> 01:09:31.638]  I've ordered more pills than anyone in the world has.
[01:09:31.698 --> 01:09:35.200]  Was that before or after your record crack pipe order?
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:37.101]  By the way, this story just came out.
[01:09:38.777 --> 01:09:44.900]  South Carolina drug overdose deaths increased 50% in 2020.
[01:09:46.201 --> 01:09:48.002]  And you've got record opioid deaths.
[01:09:48.862 --> 01:09:51.763]  You've got record fentanyl deaths because of the open border.
[01:09:52.504 --> 01:09:57.186]  And this guy's going to be ordering more pills and more fentanyl is going to be coming in.
[01:09:58.227 --> 01:10:05.150]  But don't worry, he's going to virtue signal like he's fighting it during the State of the Union because he's a liar and a phony.
[01:10:10.026 --> 01:10:13.167]  Really just incredible stuff to witness last night.
[01:10:13.247 --> 01:10:16.729]  Like when Biden says, we made the vaccine free.
[01:10:17.269 --> 01:10:19.110]  Now we all know this costs money.
[01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:20.130]  I mean, I'm done.
[01:10:21.591 --> 01:10:21.991]  I'm done.
[01:10:24.592 --> 01:10:25.492]  That's an actual quote.
[01:10:25.633 --> 01:10:27.273]  We made the vaccine free.
[01:10:27.833 --> 01:10:29.334]  We all know this costs money.
[01:10:31.415 --> 01:10:33.136]  I mean, did somebody write that into his speech?
[01:10:35.337 --> 01:10:36.197]  Or did he just say it?
[01:10:39.795 --> 01:10:41.036]  It's just total clown world.
[01:10:42.356 --> 01:10:44.198]  He talks about wanting gun control.
[01:10:44.258 --> 01:10:58.626]  So he goes from saying, we're going to arm Ukrainians, we're going to send Ukrainians guns, but then he says, you the American, you don't need a gun, because deers don't wear bulletproof vests.
[01:11:01.207 --> 01:11:16.195]   So he's making the argument for gun control in America, saying deer doesn't wear bulletproof vests, While simultaneously saying we need to send military weapons to Ukraine.
[01:11:18.596 --> 01:11:19.776]  Just amazing stuff.
[01:11:21.597 --> 01:11:27.698]  He talks about how he wants to have manufacturing back in the United States.
[01:11:29.579 --> 01:11:31.459]  And a resurgence on America's business.
[01:11:31.699 --> 01:11:33.820]  In American business and manufacturing and made in America.
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:36.001]  And you shake your head and you say, oh, okay.
[01:11:36.141 --> 01:11:36.601]  That's good.
[01:11:36.641 --> 01:11:37.261]  I'm down with that.
[01:11:38.223 --> 01:11:39.184]  And then what does he say next?
[01:11:39.604 --> 01:11:41.665]  We need to raise taxes on businesses!
[01:11:43.786 --> 01:11:44.847]  Well, you just blew that!
[01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:50.831]  We need to make it easier to do business in America!
[01:11:51.611 --> 01:11:54.253]  And we need to raise taxes on American businesses!
[01:11:56.875 --> 01:11:57.175]  Great.
[01:11:58.936 --> 01:11:59.216]  Great.
[01:11:59.997 --> 01:12:00.437]  That'll work.
[01:12:02.202 --> 01:12:03.943]  And then, you know, I love this logic.
[01:12:04.644 --> 01:12:07.126]  This is one that's always going to befuddle me, but we know what it is.
[01:12:07.186 --> 01:12:09.008]  It's just Democrats are just straight liars, man.
[01:12:09.108 --> 01:12:10.569]  I mean, there's no other way to put it.
[01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:22.198]  So, when the economy was actually doing gangbusters under Trump, and it was, right out of the gate, as soon as Trump got in, economy doing gangbusters, what did they say?
[01:12:23.279 --> 01:12:26.141]  Well, they said two things, but they said, oh, no, it's not.
[01:12:26.401 --> 01:12:30.445]  They either denied it, or they said, oh, that's Barack Obama's economy.
[01:12:31.601 --> 01:12:33.701]  That's what's so frustrating about these liberal Democrats.
[01:12:33.721 --> 01:12:41.843]  They can literally exist in two different intellectual, philosophical spaces that cannot coexist, but they do it at the same time.
[01:12:42.123 --> 01:12:53.606]  That's why I do these liberal logic short videos on Bandot Video to just show how illogical and irrational and how their two ideas cannot coexist in logical reality.
[01:12:54.966 --> 01:13:00.647]  So they said, oh, the Trump economy was bad, but also the Trump economy was great because of Obama.
[01:13:02.321 --> 01:13:03.901]  And now they're doing the same thing with Biden.
[01:13:04.802 --> 01:13:07.282]  So they're saying, and he said it last night in his speech.
[01:13:08.283 --> 01:13:13.064]  He talked about how great the economy was, how booming the economy was, how great it is.
[01:13:13.204 --> 01:13:14.404]  So is that Trump's economy then?
[01:13:15.285 --> 01:13:16.185]  That's just your logic.
[01:13:17.665 --> 01:13:22.687]  If Trump's economy was Obama's economy, then wouldn't Biden's economy be Trump's economy?
[01:13:24.947 --> 01:13:30.829]  But then in the same speech, they talked about how bad the economy was because of Trump.
[01:13:33.044 --> 01:13:38.648]  So is the economy great because of Biden, or is the economy great because of Trump, or is the economy bad?
[01:13:39.389 --> 01:13:46.614]  And they want to hold all three beliefs simultaneously and argue all three beliefs simultaneously.
[01:13:47.895 --> 01:13:51.478]  And they just assume the American people are so stupid that they won't get it.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:02.042]   He tells businesses to fight inflation, you need to lower your costs Not your wages.
[01:14:02.462 --> 01:14:04.143]  So in other words, you need to go out of business.
[01:14:04.744 --> 01:14:12.610]  So he wants to raise taxes on businesses, he wants them to lower their costs, and he proposed a $15 an hour minimum wage.
[01:14:15.131 --> 01:14:17.813]  Well, what do you think is going to happen to American businesses?
[01:14:19.615 --> 01:14:20.155]  Bye-bye!
[01:14:20.175 --> 01:14:22.037]  Bye-bye!
[01:14:23.874 --> 01:14:26.938]  But see, that's okay because everything will be replaced by robots.
[01:14:27.259 --> 01:14:30.883]  They'll have Flippy the robot serving your food, which they're already bringing out.
[01:14:31.224 --> 01:14:33.747]  You'll have robots checking you out at the grocery store.
[01:14:33.908 --> 01:14:41.317]  All this service sector that keeps people on their feet, all those jobs are going to be wiped out and replaced by robots.
[01:14:42.549 --> 01:14:58.215]  Just so the businesses can survive because the government will force them to lower their costs, it'll synthetically force them to raise their wages so they won't be able to afford workers, and they're going to raise the taxes, it'll put them all out of business.
[01:14:58.435 --> 01:14:59.495]  And then here's how they'll do it.
[01:15:01.376 --> 01:15:10.239]  Oh, okay, you're a struggling American business because we raised your taxes, we raised the minimum wage, and we forced you to lower your costs.
[01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.340]  Total communism.
[01:15:12.298 --> 01:15:15.640]  But that's what Biden will probably end up doing in some way, shape, or form.
[01:15:16.961 --> 01:15:20.724]  And then the business will say, well, I can't afford this.
[01:15:21.865 --> 01:15:28.010]  So then they'll come in with some sort of initiative, some sort of a plan, just like they do with green energy.
[01:15:29.311 --> 01:15:31.432]  Again, I'm not giving stock market advice here.
[01:15:31.452 --> 01:15:43.458]   I'm not in the stock market, but I'd say investing in robotics, And automated robotics that are going to be going into the service sector, like Flippy the Robot?
[01:15:43.838 --> 01:15:44.939]  Probably a pretty good bet.
[01:15:46.139 --> 01:15:49.600]  Probably going to make yourself a nice chunk of change on that deal.
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.101]  Because this is how they rigged the deal.
[01:15:51.121 --> 01:15:52.381]  This is how the insider trading works.
[01:15:52.961 --> 01:15:56.062]  Just like what they do with Green Energy to enrich all their friends.
[01:15:59.223 --> 01:16:02.984]  American businesses are going to say, I can't afford the minimum wage.
[01:16:04.025 --> 01:16:05.025]  You've lowered my costs.
[01:16:05.085 --> 01:16:06.106]  I can't stay in business.
[01:16:07.166 --> 01:16:08.186]  You've raised my taxes.
[01:16:08.226 --> 01:16:09.107]  I can't stay in business.
[01:16:09.647 --> 01:16:12.808]  So then the American government will come out with a plan and they'll say, okay.
[01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:21.311]  And then, you know, they'll say it's carbon neutral or green or some other crap, just to fluff it up a little bit.
[01:16:22.331 --> 01:16:26.993]  And they'll say, oh, oh, you can't afford a worker.
[01:16:27.113 --> 01:16:28.614]  Well, but you want to stay in business.
[01:16:28.654 --> 01:16:29.674]  Well, here's what we'll do for you.
[01:16:31.371 --> 01:16:41.958]  We will give you a government stimulus if you purchase automated robotics to run your company.
[01:16:41.998 --> 01:16:47.342]  Whether it's flipping burgers or checking people out or any of the other service industry jobs.
[01:16:47.622 --> 01:16:50.324]  Like, they'll have a robot at the front desk of a hotel, folks.
[01:16:50.504 --> 01:16:52.125]  I mean, how hellacious is that going to be?
[01:16:53.866 --> 01:16:59.870]  But see, they'll get kickbacks and they'll get stimulus if they sign on to that.
[01:17:01.055 --> 01:17:02.316]  And so that's how they're going to do it.
[01:17:04.357 --> 01:17:34.623]   So it's all about crushing the American businesses, removing the human from the equation, putting them into a pinch where they have to decide just to exist they have to take the robotics, just to exist they have to take the automation, Just to exist, they can only take digital currencies and then bing bang boom overnight, the human sector, the human service sector, the human-based economy is gone.
[01:17:36.404 --> 01:17:37.644]  That's what this is going to do.
[01:17:39.464 --> 01:18:03.372]   You're going to force American businesses, except for the big ones that have so much money they don't care anyway, you're going to force American businesses and small businesses to basically either close their doors or fully embrace The end of the human service sector, the end of the human economy, bringing in the robots to serve your food, check you into hotels, and everything else.
[01:18:04.833 --> 01:18:05.854]  And that's how they're going to do it.
[01:18:06.414 --> 01:18:12.838]  And it's going to be one giant boondoggle, one giant cash grab, just like they did with green energy.
[01:18:13.178 --> 01:18:14.919]  And these people are so demonic.
[01:18:16.001 --> 01:18:29.887]  They're so demonic, they're so detached from their own human soul, if they ever had one, that they won't care that it'll crush the economy, they won't care that it'll crush humanity, they won't care that it'll put millions of people into poverty, they don't care.
[01:18:30.188 --> 01:18:32.529]  Did you see Nancy Pelosi's face last night?
[01:18:32.749 --> 01:18:35.530]  Do you think she gives a damn about the little guy?
[01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:37.491]  No, she wants to CRUSH the little guy!
[01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:41.753]  And I'm about to be joined by Thomas Renz on the other side of this hour.
[01:18:43.223 --> 01:18:54.145]  We're in talks with getting Dr. Peter McCullough back on, Dr. Artis, Dr. Marbles are getting scheduled too.
[01:18:54.865 --> 01:19:03.667]  So we're going to get a full-fledged response, but quite frankly, they're probably still pouring through this large document with all the side effects that's just... I mean, it's unbelievable, folks.
[01:19:03.687 --> 01:19:08.068]  I mean, doctors are seeing this and they're just like, they're speechless.
[01:19:09.388 --> 01:19:10.529]  Kind of like I was yesterday.
[01:19:11.569 --> 01:19:12.049]  But here we go.
[01:19:14.352 --> 01:19:14.832]  The U.S.
[01:19:14.852 --> 01:19:17.454]  trade deficit hit a record all-time high in January.
[01:19:17.594 --> 01:19:19.595]  Inflation expected to be worse than expected.
[01:19:21.175 --> 01:19:26.578]  Now, last night, Joe Biden said he eliminated the trade deficit.
[01:19:26.758 --> 01:19:28.339]  I'm not even kidding you.
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:41.225]  It's well known that we've had some of the worst trade deficits, swings in trade deficits, between President Trump and now Biden.
[01:19:42.745 --> 01:19:47.286]  And then he has the nerve to go up there last night and say that he eliminated the trade deficit.
[01:19:47.946 --> 01:19:50.587]  A bold-faced lie.
[01:19:51.967 --> 01:19:55.128]  Again, just incredible, stunning lies last night.
[01:19:55.928 --> 01:19:57.508]  Everything he said was a lie.
[01:19:57.568 --> 01:19:59.229]  Everything he said was reverse reality.
[01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:01.829]  Here's some interesting stuff for you.
[01:20:01.849 --> 01:20:04.990]  Remember that Colonel Vindman fake whistleblower?
[01:20:05.939 --> 01:20:09.703]  Who actually may be secretly working for the Ukrainian army.
[01:20:09.723 --> 01:20:10.143]  Remember that?
[01:20:10.183 --> 01:20:11.044]  They offered him a job?
[01:20:11.164 --> 01:20:34.858]   Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, Putin-linked lobbyists donated over $500,000 to Democrats, earned cash from Russian state investment fund.
[01:20:35.278 --> 01:20:37.339]  Yeah, see, that's what's so frustrating about this.
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:41.761]  I mean, all these Democrats are in bed with Russia.
[01:20:43.721 --> 01:20:45.062]  Biden, the Clintons.
[01:20:46.603 --> 01:20:47.723]  I mean, it's just a joke.
[01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:52.925]  And all their foreign policy has been helping Russia.
[01:20:53.306 --> 01:21:00.672]   From Bill Clinton getting the nukes removed from Ukraine, To Barack Obama letting him go into Crimea?
[01:21:02.053 --> 01:21:04.234]  And now Joe Biden letting him take Ukraine over?
[01:21:06.075 --> 01:21:08.757]  But oh, Trump's the Russian, yes, yes.
[01:21:09.598 --> 01:21:10.198]  I'm sure.
[01:21:12.039 --> 01:21:13.620]  I'm sure, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:17.923 --> 01:21:25.168]  Fact sheet, President Biden to announce new steps to combat criminal fraud and identity theft in pandemic relief programs.
[01:21:25.448 --> 01:21:26.349]  Oh-ho-ho!
[01:21:27.421 --> 01:21:33.566]  Yeah, remember there were billions of dollars, billions of dollars stolen from the COVID relief packages.
[01:21:34.207 --> 01:21:35.848]  Just pretty much all of it was stolen.
[01:21:36.589 --> 01:21:38.370]  But how do you think this is going to go?
[01:21:39.491 --> 01:21:50.420]  Do you think there's going to be real fair investigations into people that defrauded or committed fraud to get pandemic relief programs?
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.562]  Do you really think they're going to have a fair investigation of that?
[01:21:56.013 --> 01:21:59.855]  Or do you think they're going to use that to target their political adversaries?
[01:22:02.036 --> 01:22:03.496]  Well, here's the first case.
[01:22:05.797 --> 01:22:10.539]  Auditor, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds must return $450,000 in COVID-19 relief funds.
[01:22:10.579 --> 01:22:11.060]  And there it is.
[01:22:15.495 --> 01:22:22.104]  So Biden says they're going to combat criminal fraud in the pandemic relief programs, even though it's been going on for two years and billions stolen.
[01:22:22.645 --> 01:22:23.907]  And what's the first case?
[01:22:24.287 --> 01:22:24.868]  What do they do?
[01:22:24.928 --> 01:22:25.669]  Who do they go after?
[01:22:25.689 --> 01:22:26.811]  A Republican governor.
[01:22:28.914 --> 01:22:30.977]  Now, look, maybe the Republican governor is guilty.
[01:22:31.017 --> 01:22:32.579]  Maybe it's just all political persecution.
[01:22:33.706 --> 01:22:35.226]  Quite frankly, I wouldn't be surprised either way.
[01:22:36.047 --> 01:22:36.947]  But that's not even the point.
[01:22:37.667 --> 01:22:48.550]  The point is that this is yet another tool that the Democrats are going to use to crush their competition like the authoritarian tyrants and terrorists that they are.
[01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:57.960]   And Pastor Rodney Howard Brown called it out Biden is now going to go after every ministry that took PPP.
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.001]  I'm so glad we never took money from the government.
[01:23:00.482 --> 01:23:01.983]  I told and warned everyone not to.
[01:23:02.043 --> 01:23:03.424]  However, they couldn't help themselves.
[01:23:03.784 --> 01:23:06.426]  Government was their source more than the Almighty God.
[01:23:07.247 --> 01:23:09.188]  And he's absolutely right.
[01:23:09.508 --> 01:23:10.789]  They're going to go after churches.
[01:23:10.809 --> 01:23:11.910]  They're going to go after Christians.
[01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:13.211]  They're going to go after conservatives.
[01:23:13.351 --> 01:23:22.209]   But if you're a liberal Democrat, just like they let you burn cities to the ground and commit murder, You'll be allowed to steal money from the government as long as you're a liberal democrat.
[01:23:22.229 --> 01:23:25.790]  But if you're a Christian conservative, they will come after you and they will crush you.
[01:23:26.871 --> 01:23:27.411]  You watch.
[01:23:28.651 --> 01:23:29.892]  You watch.
[01:23:30.772 --> 01:23:32.292]  It's already happening.
[01:23:32.412 --> 01:23:34.313]  Didn't even take a single day.
[01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:36.134]  They've already got it all lined up, folks.
[01:23:36.194 --> 01:23:37.294]  They've already got it all lined up.
[01:23:39.758 --> 01:23:42.959]  Don't worry, we didn't take any of that dirty money.
[01:23:43.779 --> 01:23:45.179]  The gangster mafia money.
[01:23:45.419 --> 01:23:49.780]  Would you take a loan from a mafia gangster that murders and kills people?
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.661]  Would you take a loan from our government?
[01:23:54.961 --> 01:23:59.942]  Elon Musk takes aim at President Biden after he fails to mention Tesla during State of the Union.
[01:23:59.962 --> 01:24:18.899]   Says nobody was watching it, nobody cared, but he was upset because Biden was giving credit to Ford and to I think it was GM on how they're building electric vehicles and Musk is sitting here like, uh, hi, that's all I've been doing with Tesla.
[01:24:18.959 --> 01:24:19.899]  Hi, ever heard of me?
[01:24:19.959 --> 01:24:21.800]  Been doing electric vehicles for a long time now?
[01:24:22.981 --> 01:24:23.221]  No.
[01:24:24.002 --> 01:24:32.808]  Oh, by the way, we also gave Starlink to Ukraine for free so that they could communicate with one another when Russia blows out all their radio towers and TV towers.
[01:24:33.188 --> 01:24:34.409]  Yeah, no mention of that either.
[01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:37.991]  No mention of that either.
[01:24:40.023 --> 01:24:45.225]  Biden to rally lawmakers around efforts to end cancer as we know it in State of the Union speech.
[01:24:45.285 --> 01:24:46.145]  You know, I didn't realize this.
[01:24:46.385 --> 01:24:51.207]  I know that he promised in his campaign, Joe Biden promised to end cancer.
[01:24:51.227 --> 01:24:51.727]  Did you know that?
[01:24:52.387 --> 01:24:53.687]  When he was campaigning for president?
[01:24:53.947 --> 01:24:55.788]  The two or three campaign stops that he had?
[01:24:56.488 --> 01:24:57.448]  With the circles and everything?
[01:24:58.129 --> 01:24:59.889]  He promised he would end cancer.
[01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:03.270]  Yeah, you were told that you'd get the end of cancer.
[01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:04.451]  Instead, you got World War III.
[01:25:04.951 --> 01:25:08.392]  But it turns out this has actually been a lie of Biden's for decades.
[01:25:09.943 --> 01:25:14.246]  When he was the Vice President under Obama, he was saying he was going to cure cancer forever.
[01:25:14.506 --> 01:25:19.069]  So Biden has been telling the world he's going to cure cancer for 10 frickin' years.
[01:25:22.051 --> 01:25:23.592]  Yet he's a cancer on this country.
[01:25:25.693 --> 01:25:35.599]  Oil surges into super backwards, super backwardization after OPEC sticks to production plan, shuns Biden's demands.
[01:25:35.739 --> 01:25:36.500]  Oh, no kidding?
[01:25:37.540 --> 01:25:45.385]  You mean Saudi Arabia and Russia balked at Joe Biden demanding they pump out more oil and give it to him at a cheap price?
[01:25:45.445 --> 01:25:46.546]  You mean they balked at that?
[01:25:46.766 --> 01:25:47.207]  Wow.
[01:25:48.087 --> 01:25:50.589]  I'm stunned.
[01:25:50.869 --> 01:25:54.352]  You mean the rest of the planet doesn't want to give America foreign aid or help us out?
[01:25:54.552 --> 01:25:56.353]  I am flabbergasted.
[01:25:57.974 --> 01:25:58.775]  Stunning stuff.
[01:25:59.195 --> 01:26:00.816]  Did Joe Biden really think that was going to work?
[01:26:01.056 --> 01:26:05.079]  I mean, did they really think begging OPEC or Saudi Arabia to give him oil for cheap was going to work?
[01:26:06.522 --> 01:26:09.343]  Because Biden made us reliant on Russian oil and now he can't get out of it?
[01:26:11.504 --> 01:26:12.824]  It's just such a joke, man.
[01:26:14.285 --> 01:26:16.225]  It is just such a joke.
[01:26:16.285 --> 01:26:17.746]  And you know what's going to happen now, folks?
[01:26:18.966 --> 01:26:20.887]  Russia's going to increase their oil prices.
[01:26:21.267 --> 01:26:23.528]  Saudi Arabia's going to increase their oil prices.
[01:26:25.468 --> 01:26:31.510]  And, I mean, the only hope is that Canada starts pumping out more oil and sells it to us cheap.
[01:26:32.011 --> 01:26:32.931]  But that's not going to happen.
[01:26:35.015 --> 01:26:37.496]  And you know Biden's not going to reopen our oil pipelines.
[01:26:37.516 --> 01:26:39.316]  He's not going to open our energy sector.
[01:26:39.796 --> 01:26:41.417]  So, just you wait.
[01:26:42.157 --> 01:26:50.939]  I'll predict right now, if nothing changes, you will see $10 a gallon gasoline in California.
[01:26:52.499 --> 01:26:56.300]  Probably in a year.
[01:26:56.580 --> 01:27:00.681]  Probably in a year, you'll see $10 a gallon gasoline in California.
[01:27:03.464 --> 01:27:26.019]  And it's all by design, folks, to wean you off cheap energy, get you onto the big lie and boondoggle of quote-unquote green energy, crush the economy and make the new precedent that you, the citizen of America, you just don't travel, you just don't buy a car, you don't fly on a plane, unless you have millions and millions of dollars like Joe Biden.
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:35.620]   Now, there's some funny memes out there of the choice of Attire that some of these Democrats wore like Kamala Harris
[01:27:35.620 --> 01:27:40.640]   trying to blend in with the brown chair Not a good look for her
[01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:45.319]   but You know, it's a look you want to blend into the background
[01:27:45.319 --> 01:27:50.119]   behind you some people like that look she also looks like the
[01:27:50.119 --> 01:27:58.140]   murderers murderous psychopath from no country from old men not just with the outfit, but the look and the energy in
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:07.379]   the field as well and And then there was old Maxine Waters with the pirate suit that was once part of a comedy show, Seinfeld, with Jerry wearing the pirate suit.
[01:28:08.499 --> 01:28:08.979]  Arrgh!
[01:28:09.119 --> 01:28:10.820]  Says Maxine Waters last night.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:11.981]  Arrgh!
[01:28:13.221 --> 01:28:14.562]  You stole my booty!
[01:28:14.642 --> 01:28:16.102]  You stole my booty!
[01:28:16.222 --> 01:28:17.663]  Maxine Waters in the pirate outfit.
[01:28:17.743 --> 01:28:17.983]  Alright.
[01:28:19.773 --> 01:28:22.094]  We've got Thomas Renz coming up on the other side.
[01:28:22.254 --> 01:28:26.797]  I've still got tons and tons of news here on my desk we're going to get to.

[01:28:51.778 --> 01:28:55.241]  Alright, we've got the clip, and I was asking the crew, because they just found it.
[01:28:55.642 --> 01:28:57.603]  I said, is it as good as I remember?
[01:28:57.683 --> 01:28:58.984]  And they said, absolutely.
[01:29:00.145 --> 01:29:03.328]  And I'm just telling you, man, we're all kind of feeling the same way here.
[01:29:05.006 --> 01:29:09.608]  I feel like I'm in a jackass movie, or I'm in, like, the TV show Punk'd or something.
[01:29:10.329 --> 01:29:18.012]  Like, is Ashton Kutcher, like, gonna pop out of a door at the State of the Union and be like, we're just kidding, haha, you've been on Punk'd, like, is it all just a joke?
[01:29:18.032 --> 01:29:18.853]  Are these people serious?
[01:29:20.093 --> 01:29:30.256]  So here is another one of the comic relief factors from last night's honk of the honk world, honk of the clown world address last night.
[01:29:31.056 --> 01:29:36.717]  Here's Biden saying, the vaccines are free and everybody knows this costs money.
[01:29:36.777 --> 01:29:37.217]  Check it out.
[01:29:38.038 --> 01:29:39.798]  And hospitalizations down by 77%.
[01:29:41.818 --> 01:29:47.580]  Most Americans can remove their masks and stay in the classroom and move forward safely.
[01:29:48.499 --> 01:29:53.040]  We achieved this because we provided free vaccines, treatments, tests, and masks.
[01:29:53.801 --> 01:29:55.681]  Of course, continuing this costs money.
[01:29:56.501 --> 01:30:00.062]  I'm not surprised we'll be back to see y'all.
[01:30:00.242 --> 01:30:01.423]  They're laughing at him!
[01:30:01.463 --> 01:30:04.984]  Look at Kamala smirking, they're laughing!
[01:30:05.824 --> 01:30:07.585]  I mean, guys, here's what we need to do.
[01:30:08.845 --> 01:30:10.605]  Like, I gotta get the exact quote.
[01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:18.312]   So it's, we provided free vaccines, Testing and healthcare.
[01:30:19.413 --> 01:30:22.094]  Of course, to continue this, it will cost money.
[01:30:23.654 --> 01:30:24.454]  I thought it was free!
[01:30:25.315 --> 01:30:26.715]  How can free cost money?
[01:30:27.095 --> 01:30:28.656]  Something doesn't add up here, Joe.
[01:30:29.356 --> 01:30:30.276]  Who wrote that?
[01:30:31.216 --> 01:30:32.557]  Did somebody prank Biden?
[01:30:32.577 --> 01:30:37.418]  I mean, seriously, like, was that, was, was Biden's speechwriter pranking him last night?
[01:30:37.658 --> 01:30:38.799]  Fund the police?
[01:30:39.419 --> 01:30:40.019]  It's free?
[01:30:40.119 --> 01:30:40.939]  It costs money?
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.100]  Was this a prankster?
[01:30:44.401 --> 01:30:45.641]  The greatest prank of all time?
[01:30:47.705 --> 01:30:52.986]  It's like, oh yeah, I pulled a prank the other day on my friend.
[01:30:53.006 --> 01:30:54.606]  He's like, oh yeah, you think you pulled a prank?
[01:30:54.847 --> 01:30:57.907]  I wrote a fake speech for Biden that he read as the State of the Union.
[01:30:57.927 --> 01:30:59.167]  It's like, what are you talking about?
[01:30:59.187 --> 01:31:02.048]  He's like, I got Democrats to cheer for funding the police.
[01:31:02.748 --> 01:31:05.189]  I got Biden to say something's free costs money.
[01:31:05.449 --> 01:31:06.309]  Like, no way.
[01:31:06.609 --> 01:31:07.969]  Yeah, look, look, dude, I did it.
[01:31:08.009 --> 01:31:08.709]  Look, here it is.
[01:31:11.590 --> 01:31:12.530]  Unbelievable.
[01:31:13.891 --> 01:31:14.751]  But you witnessed it.
[01:31:14.791 --> 01:31:15.531]  We all saw it.
[01:31:16.860 --> 01:31:18.721]  We gave free vaccines!
[01:31:19.642 --> 01:31:21.403]  Now everybody knows this costs money!
[01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:24.705]  I mean, rimshot please!
[01:31:25.806 --> 01:31:28.748]  And then the gallery laughs because they know how ridiculous it is.
[01:31:29.048 --> 01:31:38.054]  And it was already so ridiculous by that point, it was just, you're like watching a stand-up comic, except at any point he might fall over or crap his pants.
[01:31:38.374 --> 01:31:40.035]  Well, I guess that would add to the comic relief.
[01:31:42.377 --> 01:31:45.619]  Although I'm sure they double-dippered him last night just in case.
[01:31:48.010 --> 01:31:51.213]  Uh, I mean, who knows what kind of speed he was on.
[01:31:51.233 --> 01:31:53.335]  I mean, we all know Pelosi was higher than a kite.
[01:31:53.355 --> 01:32:02.542]  I mean, that's like a kid in high school, like, walks in, like, eyes all glazed over, like, hey, man, you're like, are you... you... smoking some marijuana before class today, son?
[01:32:02.582 --> 01:32:03.843]  He's like, argh, argh, argh.
[01:32:04.444 --> 01:32:05.745]  Like, oh, you smell like it, too.
[01:32:06.185 --> 01:32:14.051]  Like, here's Nancy Pelosi, just like, just blazed out of her mind, like, ugh, ahh, ahh, yeah.
[01:32:14.412 --> 01:32:15.613]  She almost falls over.
[01:32:16.966 --> 01:32:18.768]  She can't keep her dentures in place?
[01:32:21.690 --> 01:32:24.512]  It'd be a lot funnier if these people weren't destroying our lives.
[01:32:25.253 --> 01:32:28.176]  Biden unveils plan to fight inflation that he caused.
[01:32:29.136 --> 01:32:32.860]  Revives Build Back Better, calling it Make America Great Again.
[01:32:32.940 --> 01:32:34.061]  You can't make this stuff up.
[01:32:34.181 --> 01:32:35.101]  During first State of the Union.
[01:32:35.121 --> 01:32:37.123]  I mean, he literally, that's what I'm saying.
[01:32:38.044 --> 01:32:47.944]   It's like the speechwriter was running a prank like, hey, I'm going to write a Donald Trump 2016 campaign speech and I'm going to have Biden read it at the State of the Union.
[01:32:48.004 --> 01:32:50.907]  It's like, oh, they're all like elbowing, nudging each other.
[01:32:50.927 --> 01:32:51.927]  Oh, you couldn't do that.
[01:32:51.947 --> 01:32:52.468]  No way.
[01:32:52.928 --> 01:32:53.869]  And then they did it.
[01:32:54.609 --> 01:32:55.690]  We need a strong border.
[01:32:55.970 --> 01:32:57.191]  We need to fund the police.
[01:33:00.073 --> 01:33:01.635]  America is the greatest country on earth.
[01:33:01.655 --> 01:33:02.835]  We need to make America great again.
[01:33:03.316 --> 01:33:07.379]  Am I listening to Biden's State of the Union or a 2016 Trump campaign speech?
[01:33:11.165 --> 01:33:14.967]  Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert heckled Biden during State of the Union.
[01:33:14.987 --> 01:33:16.648]  You know, some people gave him some criticism for that.
[01:33:17.208 --> 01:33:17.789]  I didn't mind it.
[01:33:18.829 --> 01:33:26.693]  And actually, I wish they would have done more of it because if you noticed, folks, if they would have heckled Biden a couple more times, he would have been so flummoxed.
[01:33:27.434 --> 01:33:29.275]  He would have lost his place on the teleprompter.
[01:33:29.535 --> 01:33:32.857]  He would have had the dazed and confused deer-in-the-headlights look for minutes.
[01:33:33.137 --> 01:33:35.198]  The whole thing would have come to a halting screech.
[01:33:36.711 --> 01:33:40.070]   And just the tiny little heckling, which was barely even heckling,
[01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:43.831]  that Green and Taylor did almost completely threw him off.
[01:33:43.831 --> 01:33:54.511]  I've been on air more than 25 years.
[01:33:54.511 --> 01:34:01.150]   And long before I started selling high quality vitamin D3 eight years ago, I've been promoting people
[01:34:01.150 --> 01:34:05.230]  taking vitamin D3 because it is essential.
[01:34:05.267 --> 01:34:09.309]   And if you're not getting sunshine shine. Every single day, whether you're black or white or
[01:34:09.309 --> 01:34:13.778]   Hispanic, it doesn't matter. Your body will be susceptible and wide open to so many of the
[01:34:13.778 --> 01:34:15.449]  threats that are out there.
[01:34:15.449 --> 01:34:19.809]   It's just like you need oxygen, you die in four minutes without oxygen. You die in five
[01:34:19.809 --> 01:34:22.729]  or six days without water, you die in a month without food.
[01:34:22.729 --> 01:34:28.338]   Well, that's because these key minerals and elements and vitamins are in the food that you
[01:34:28.338 --> 01:34:32.189]   need. And one of the most important for your immune system and your overall health is

[01:34:51.764 --> 01:34:55.686]  Attorney Thomas Renz joins me here on the Alex Jones Show and...
[01:34:56.957 --> 01:35:22.347]   You know, this is probably a sad moment of vindication for you because when you, under the penalty of perjury, presented the Department of Defense information when it comes to all of this massive increase in neurological disorders and heart problems and everything, Which was just a Department of Defense database that you had the information and then magically they lost it.
[01:35:22.607 --> 01:35:23.167]  No big deal.
[01:35:23.528 --> 01:35:24.549]  You conserved it.
[01:35:24.849 --> 01:35:25.450]  You preserved it.
[01:35:26.031 --> 01:35:26.831]  So you still have it.
[01:35:26.871 --> 01:35:34.300]  But now Pfizer has released the data that it tried to cover up for almost a whole century before we could see it.
[01:35:35.281 --> 01:35:36.422]  And they were forced to release it.
[01:35:37.183 --> 01:35:45.297]   And according to the data It's a 3% mortality rate with the vaccine, a 93% adverse reaction rate.
[01:35:45.577 --> 01:35:49.040]  This is a three-month vaccine, Pfizer COVID vaccine study.
[01:35:49.761 --> 01:36:01.972]  So I just want to get your response to this news and how do you correlate that with the information and the data you provided with the Department of Defense documents you presented at the second opinion hearing.
[01:36:02.172 --> 01:36:02.752]  Thomas Renz.
[01:36:04.734 --> 01:36:09.353]   Well, I'm going to tell you that it's You know, I haven't fully reviewed all of the stuff from Pfizer yet.
[01:36:09.373 --> 01:36:10.233]  I'm working through it.
[01:36:10.293 --> 01:36:15.075]  But from what I've seen, I'm going to tell you that I think it's actually worse than what they presented.
[01:36:15.316 --> 01:36:18.817]  I think those studies that they turned into the FDA were whitewashed to an extent.
[01:36:19.378 --> 01:36:21.199]  I think the data is probably much worse.
[01:36:21.679 --> 01:36:25.581]  You know, we've been looking at data back in June of last year.
[01:36:25.601 --> 01:36:33.685]  I came forward and I had to do the speech and I said, listen, we got a whistleblower who's calculated that there's been at least 45,000 deaths from this vaccine.
[01:36:35.087 --> 01:36:36.328]  Of course, I was fact-checked.
[01:36:36.368 --> 01:36:37.748]  Everybody said, no, no, no.
[01:36:38.508 --> 01:36:41.870]  And then we started listing side effects, like you're looking at here.
[01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:44.210]  We started listing things that could happen.
[01:36:44.650 --> 01:36:49.072]  Things that would do, you know, we've been talking about this for quite some time.
[01:36:49.132 --> 01:36:49.892]  This isn't new.
[01:36:49.952 --> 01:36:51.053]  This isn't surprising.
[01:36:51.093 --> 01:36:54.634]  My friend Sherry Tenpenny, she, I mean, she's been talking about it from the beginning.
[01:36:55.514 --> 01:37:00.265]   Yeah, what we're seeing now is I mean, I don't really want to say it's vindication.
[01:37:00.325 --> 01:37:01.166]  We know we're right.
[01:37:01.226 --> 01:37:02.826]  We've known we're right for a long time.
[01:37:03.407 --> 01:37:05.307]  We're just seeing the collapse of the narrative.
[01:37:05.688 --> 01:37:08.969]  But what we're also seeing is an epic level of corruption.
[01:37:09.469 --> 01:37:28.544]   Instead of Biden trying to hold these people accountable, and instead of the people who are going to now face lifelong health problems, assuming that they have a long life, which is really questionable, Now, the Democrats have decided that they want to sweep this under the rug with the willing help of the Rhino Republicans.
[01:37:29.164 --> 01:37:30.865]  They want to say, yep, COVID's over.
[01:37:31.065 --> 01:37:37.108]  Oh, there might have been a few mistakes, but we can just move on because, you know, we the government, we did right by you guys.
[01:37:37.128 --> 01:37:38.229]  We tried our best.
[01:37:38.289 --> 01:37:45.372]  You know, those nasty other people, they may have given us some false info, but, you know, that's why you need to give us more control and so on and so forth.
[01:37:45.752 --> 01:37:59.596]   The reality is, is that Joe Biden, Anthony Fauci, Austin, Wellensky, all these people belong in a cell somewhere under Gitmo for the terror that they've unleashed on this nation.
[01:38:00.116 --> 01:38:01.516]  It is sick what's happened.
[01:38:01.876 --> 01:38:03.117]  Our soldiers are sick.
[01:38:03.497 --> 01:38:04.637]  Our soldiers are dying.
[01:38:05.077 --> 01:38:06.097]  Our public is sick.
[01:38:06.157 --> 01:38:06.878]  We've got children.
[01:38:06.918 --> 01:38:12.619]  I just had a six-year-old child died here just about 20 miles from me yesterday.
[01:38:13.046 --> 01:38:17.429]  You know, from unexpected causes, the unknown causes, totally unexpected.
[01:38:17.469 --> 01:38:22.251]  Of course, they got the jab, but you know, this is so sick what's happening.
[01:38:23.192 --> 01:38:29.756]  And, you know, now we hear the people who are behind this talking about, well, we need to start rebuilding trust in government.
[01:38:29.836 --> 01:38:32.718]  No, we need to never trust government again.
[01:38:33.058 --> 01:38:34.899]  Trusting government is how this happened.
[01:38:35.499 --> 01:38:36.920]  These people are liars.
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.001]  They're scumbags.
[01:38:38.301 --> 01:38:41.823]  And when you give people power without keeping them in check, this is what happens.
[01:38:43.325 --> 01:38:54.594]  And it's just so frustrating when, I mean, you're on the front lines of this, we've been on the front lines of covering this, and they try to act like it's non-existent, and it's like, look man, you can act like it doesn't exist as much as you want.
[01:38:54.654 --> 01:38:58.097]  We've covered the cases, we know the names, we know the people that have died.
[01:38:58.137 --> 01:38:59.899]  This is a serious problem.
[01:39:00.239 --> 01:39:14.174]   We have the data, they try to cover it up, and it's like, I mean, at what point Oh, what a perfect distraction with the war in Ukraine right before this data comes out to distract from it.
[01:39:14.234 --> 01:39:15.875]  Now they just want us to forget about COVID.
[01:39:16.195 --> 01:39:17.676]  Well, we're not going to forget about COVID.
[01:39:18.657 --> 01:39:24.220]  When you say you think they whitewashed the study results that they published, what do you mean by that?
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:27.642]  Do you mean because they only kept it to a three-month study?
[01:39:27.762 --> 01:39:30.344]  Do you think they weren't fully honest about the side effects?
[01:39:30.784 --> 01:39:33.005]  How do you think they whitewashed their report?
[01:39:33.025 --> 01:39:36.968]  I think the numbers are actually worse than what that study showed.
[01:39:39.293 --> 01:39:46.740]  This is speculation right now, although I do intend to get to the bottom and see what happens.
[01:39:47.441 --> 01:39:51.405]  What it looks like to me is it looks like they did the same thing that they did in all their other studies.
[01:39:51.485 --> 01:39:55.389]  Now, you know about the lady who blew the whistle on the bad study out of Texas, I believe?
[01:39:55.409 --> 01:39:59.894]  There's been a number of reports.
[01:40:01.432 --> 01:40:04.694]  You know, Pfizer manipulating the data, Moderna manipulating data in their studies.
[01:40:05.155 --> 01:40:07.416]  I think the data is actually worse and I think they know it.
[01:40:07.977 --> 01:40:17.845]  We also know, I mean, we've got a lot of evidence that we can't make public right now and, you know, a lot of that indicates that there's more going on here than what's being being made public.
[01:40:18.365 --> 01:40:25.691]  I think that this was a, I think that this stuff that they turned into the FDA, they tried to whitewash it the best that they could.
[01:40:25.731 --> 01:40:37.218]   They tried to make these studies look as good as they could, you know, so that they could I don't have political cover, but the bottom line is even with that, these numbers are horrifying.
[01:40:37.639 --> 01:40:38.379]  It's sickening.
[01:40:39.119 --> 01:40:43.759]   You know, we recall the Chevy Volt because there might be a battery fire, but we keep
[01:40:43.759 --> 01:40:50.958]   pushing ahead with admittedly at least, what was it, a 3% mortality rate?
[01:40:50.958 --> 01:40:58.720]   I mean, you know, listen, that's a heck of a lot more than the Chevy Volt's killed, but
[01:40:59.615 --> 01:41:02.720]  And that's a higher mortality rate than COVID itself!
[01:41:04.362 --> 01:41:07.247]  By a thousand-fold!
[01:41:07.287 --> 01:41:07.767]  Like 20,000-fold!
[01:41:07.807 --> 01:41:09.229]  I mean, it's not even close!
[01:41:10.563 --> 01:41:24.212]  Yeah, well, I mean, you figure the mortality rate for COVID, you know, I believe Ioannidis was talking about around 0.2526, so you've got times 4 times 3, so 12x factor, right?
[01:41:25.052 --> 01:41:27.954]  I mean, that's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:41:28.635 --> 01:41:31.837]  And, you know, let's not overlook the FDA.
[01:41:32.057 --> 01:41:36.740]  Under the law, pursuant to the law, the FDA has to do a balancing test.
[01:41:37.392 --> 01:41:38.955]  When they authorize this, right?
[01:41:39.215 --> 01:41:43.422]  They have to balance the harms versus the potential benefits.
[01:41:43.923 --> 01:41:46.327]  So if you're looking at a 12x factor.
[01:41:47.208 --> 01:41:48.389]  And the FDA approved it.
[01:41:48.549 --> 01:41:57.836]  I want to know who's going to jail for murder first and conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to commit fraud and multiple fraud actions.
[01:41:58.256 --> 01:42:05.101]  I want to know where the independent investigation, you know, Biden says, oh, we're going to have a prosecutor look into the special prosecutor.
[01:42:05.341 --> 01:42:06.141]  Yeah.
[01:42:06.502 --> 01:42:07.442]  What's he going to look at?
[01:42:07.662 --> 01:42:08.723]  You know, it's a Biden guy.
[01:42:08.763 --> 01:42:13.086]   So he's going to probably look at people like us who are Spreading misinformation, right?
[01:42:13.406 --> 01:42:15.107]  Let me tell you about the misinformation.
[01:42:15.307 --> 01:42:23.612]  Everything that's came out of Fauci, the FDA's mouth, everything that Biden was stupid enough to believe, you know, on the plus side, I don't think he actually knew what he was saying.
[01:42:23.632 --> 01:42:25.213]  I think the dementia is too severe.
[01:42:25.854 --> 01:42:28.495]  So, you know, he might be exculpated for that.
[01:42:28.575 --> 01:42:31.897]  But this is absolutely unbelievable.
[01:42:31.917 --> 01:42:34.379]  There has to be jail time for a lot of people.
[01:42:34.879 --> 01:42:36.120]  And this Ukraine thing?
[01:42:37.381 --> 01:42:39.382]  You just finished poisoning our soldiers.
[01:42:40.174 --> 01:42:50.857]  You want to throw as much as 25% of them out of the military, and now you're going to start a war with Ukraine, which is only going to allow China to invade Taiwan.
[01:42:50.957 --> 01:42:53.357]  Ukraine's no strategic value whatsoever.
[01:42:53.697 --> 01:42:55.258]  I don't care if Russia has Ukraine.
[01:42:55.358 --> 01:42:56.438]  It makes no difference to me.
[01:42:56.798 --> 01:43:01.279]  Outside of the people of Ukraine, who I feel bad for, I care zero about the country.
[01:43:01.719 --> 01:43:07.601]  It doesn't affect us in this country, and we should support anyone who's dealing with human rights issues.
[01:43:09.429 --> 01:43:11.570]  What strategic value is there to Ukraine?
[01:43:11.810 --> 01:43:14.230]  Now Taiwan, a lot of strategic value.
[01:43:14.270 --> 01:43:18.611]  So we go to Ukraine with our broken military because Biden's been destroying it.
[01:43:19.212 --> 01:43:20.432]  China invades Taiwan.
[01:43:20.512 --> 01:43:21.912]  We can't do anything about it, right?
[01:43:22.012 --> 01:43:24.153]  Because, you know, we're already in Ukraine.
[01:43:25.093 --> 01:43:38.958]   Yeah, I mean, between purging patriots and non-vaxxed from the military and Introducing the feminization of the men and the transsexuals and turning our military gay.
[01:43:39.359 --> 01:43:39.619]  Really?
[01:43:39.659 --> 01:43:42.663]  We're going to fight a war with Russia and we're going to fight a war with China?
[01:43:42.984 --> 01:43:44.927]  Yeah, I don't like the odds of that at all.
[01:43:45.754 --> 01:43:56.560]  And we can get into more of that on the other side, but just to give a little more weight to what you were saying earlier, it's not just a Chevy Volt battery that blows up and maybe three or four people end up in a fatal car crash or incident because of it.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:03.944]  They pulled just, I think it was just this week, they pulled a baby formula off the shelves after two deaths.
[01:44:04.704 --> 01:44:07.566]  A baby formula pulled off the shelves after two deaths.
[01:44:08.126 --> 01:44:17.577]   I've got 1,200 deaths in a three-month study Of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, I've got 1,200 deaths, and they're still out there promoting it.
[01:44:17.857 --> 01:44:30.266]  Biden promoting it last night during his State of the Union address, but they'll pull a baby formula off the shelves from two deaths, more than 20,000 deaths from the vaccine that we know of, and they promote it at the State of the Union.
[01:44:30.406 --> 01:44:31.567]  We'll be right back with Thomas Renz.
[01:44:32.668 --> 01:44:34.149]  We're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:34.309 --> 01:44:35.290]  Owen Troyer sitting in.
[01:44:35.350 --> 01:44:43.072]   Thomas Renz is my guest, and you know, Thomas, we can definitely talk Ukraine and Russia seems are very informed on that as well.
[01:44:43.152 --> 01:44:54.861]  I want to continue with some of the vaccine stuff here, though, because I mean, look, folks, the list of the side effects here, it's basically like an encyclopedia of disease.
[01:44:54.921 --> 01:45:02.087]  I mean, it's like every disease, every ailment known to mankind is is considered a adverse reaction to the vaccine.
[01:45:02.647 --> 01:45:03.688]  And I'm not a doctor.
[01:45:03.728 --> 01:45:08.652]  And we've got doctors that are going to be coming up tomorrow to try to explain this to me, because I'm not a doctor.
[01:45:10.071 --> 01:45:14.196]  Thomas Renz is not a doctor either, he's an attorney, but... It's like, how can this be?
[01:45:14.256 --> 01:45:20.002]  Is it basically just... Because what some doctors I've read are insinuating is that basically this...
[01:45:21.249 --> 01:45:33.756]  Vaccine gets inside of you, and it just completely resets your human genome, it resets your DNA, it resets your immune system, and it basically just makes you prone to every disease ever known to mankind!
[01:45:34.336 --> 01:45:38.158]  Again, I'm not the doctor, that's just a layman trying to read and understand this.
[01:45:38.178 --> 01:45:48.084]  I mean, how do you make sense of an encyclopedia of human ailments and disease being released as side effects in a three-month Pfizer vaccine study?
[01:45:49.844 --> 01:45:53.006]  Well, let me start out by making this real clear.
[01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:59.149]  This is the single most dangerous consumer product on the market by hundreds of times.
[01:45:59.450 --> 01:46:11.156]  Any organization that put out a product like this would normally be sued into oblivion, but because we offer immunity to the vaccine companies, they haven't been sued yet.
[01:46:11.236 --> 01:46:13.838]  Oh my God, I'm so sorry for cutting off, but this is so key.
[01:46:13.918 --> 01:46:20.882]   Last night, Biden said gun manufacturing companies Are the only companies in America that are immune to lawsuits.
[01:46:21.122 --> 01:46:23.243]  First of all, that's a lie on its face.
[01:46:23.403 --> 01:46:25.484]  Gun manufacturers have been sued.
[01:46:25.884 --> 01:46:28.405]  Some have been sued into being shut down.
[01:46:28.825 --> 01:46:30.866]  And he says, oh, gun manufacturers can't be sued.
[01:46:31.086 --> 01:46:32.047]  That's a bold faced lie.
[01:46:32.387 --> 01:46:39.390]  The only, as you just said, the only institution or industry that can't be sued is the vaccine manufacturers.
[01:46:40.671 --> 01:46:41.171]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:41.351 --> 01:46:41.792]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:42.232 --> 01:46:46.654]  And let me tell you about this encyclopedia of death that you've got there.
[01:46:47.503 --> 01:46:51.445]  Okay, so people say to me, they say, well you're not a doctor, how can you do this?
[01:46:51.805 --> 01:46:59.048]  Okay, so my job for the last two years has been taking what the doctors figure out and figuring out how to explain it to lay people.
[01:46:59.128 --> 01:47:02.570]  Because a judge, a jury, these people are not going to understand.
[01:47:03.790 --> 01:47:08.232]  Bob Malone on his dumbest day is smarter than any five people I've ever ran across.
[01:47:08.292 --> 01:47:10.753]  Peter McCullough, these guys are brilliant, right?
[01:47:11.294 --> 01:47:14.415]  So my job is to take what they do and convert it to English.
[01:47:14.955 --> 01:47:16.336]  Here's what I can tell you about this.
[01:47:17.108 --> 01:47:21.393]  I had a doctor said, you know, you put out this DMed stuff and it said cancer.
[01:47:21.413 --> 01:47:23.575]  Well, how could there be an increase in cancer?
[01:47:23.615 --> 01:47:24.877]  That doesn't happen that bad.
[01:47:25.737 --> 01:47:26.839]  Here's how this works.
[01:47:27.981 --> 01:47:29.662]  These are not vaccines.
[01:47:29.862 --> 01:47:31.842]  These are gene therapies, okay?
[01:47:32.243 --> 01:47:40.125]  There's just a study, they talk about how it alters your DNA, and God bless him, Bongino was very upset about this because he just found out about it.
[01:47:40.445 --> 01:47:46.007]  Yeah, and I was gonna say, there's multiple conservative talk show hosts that are in fear about what they put into your body.
[01:47:46.047 --> 01:47:48.088]  Like you said, I feel bad for them.
[01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:49.789]  It's just, that's the situation.
[01:47:50.129 --> 01:47:51.609]  I have friends that are the same way.
[01:47:51.989 --> 01:47:56.531]  It's like, hey, I tried to tell you, I don't want to be rude, but I mean, yeah, people are freaked out.
[01:47:56.571 --> 01:47:58.794]   I mean, How could you not be seeing the side effects?
[01:47:59.415 --> 01:48:00.817]  Well, but here's the deal.
[01:48:01.197 --> 01:48:04.943]  So, we have the Moderna, the Pfizer documents that are set from 2019.
[01:48:07.068 --> 01:48:10.529]  Talking about the fact that mRNA is a gene therapy.
[01:48:11.069 --> 01:48:12.970]  We know that it's a gene therapy.
[01:48:12.990 --> 01:48:14.770]  This is long since established.
[01:48:15.251 --> 01:48:17.231]  And yes, it screws with your DNA.
[01:48:17.771 --> 01:48:21.532]  And that's my answer to the cancer question and all these other things.
[01:48:22.073 --> 01:48:25.034]  So you say, well, you wouldn't normally see cancer develop that fast.
[01:48:25.054 --> 01:48:25.514]  You're right.
[01:48:25.814 --> 01:48:26.234]  You wouldn't.
[01:48:26.714 --> 01:48:29.575]  But when is the last time that we altered your genome?
[01:48:30.445 --> 01:48:33.750]  Name one other drug in this category that's been so widely distributed.
[01:48:34.050 --> 01:48:34.751]  There aren't any.
[01:48:35.211 --> 01:48:45.525]  This was a drug that was hurried to market, it was pushed out to the door, it wasn't safe, there were no long-term tests, and it was not only a new drug, but it was a new category of drug.
[01:48:46.025 --> 01:48:48.147]  We've never done gene therapies before.
[01:48:48.567 --> 01:48:51.870]  So you put out a gene therapy and guess what it ends up doing?
[01:48:52.190 --> 01:48:54.051]  Causing all sorts of unexpected issues.
[01:48:54.291 --> 01:48:57.734]  This is why you normally have a 10 to 15 year test cycle on this stuff.
[01:48:58.094 --> 01:49:02.418]  But we didn't want to do that because we wanted to make all this money, wanted to cause all this trouble.
[01:49:02.938 --> 01:49:05.120]  You know, there's all these issues that were behind this.
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.123]  But the bottom line is, is these drugs were untested.
[01:49:09.603 --> 01:49:13.466]  We all knew they were going to be unsafe, but the mainstream covered it up.
[01:49:14.026 --> 01:49:15.467]  Anthony Fauci covered it up.
[01:49:16.007 --> 01:49:20.269]  All these lists of side effects, all these things, they've been out there for quite some time.
[01:49:20.449 --> 01:49:21.450]  Everybody knew about it.
[01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:32.095]  But you've got to understand, Anthony Fauci, President Biden, that anyone that's had anything to do with DHHS and the Department of Homeland Security knows this.
[01:49:33.015 --> 01:49:34.576]  Austin and the DOD know this.
[01:49:34.596 --> 01:49:35.957]  These guys all know this.
[01:49:36.637 --> 01:49:38.840]  They've been covering it up for over a year.
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:40.902]  They knew what was going to happen.
[01:49:41.303 --> 01:49:42.984]  They knew what was likely to happen.
[01:49:43.325 --> 01:49:48.671]  And they decided that the wealth transfer that they were going to do was more important than the lives of American citizens.
[01:49:48.751 --> 01:49:57.621]  And my question for these scumbags in Washington is, in this election season, are you going to demand transparent and open investigations?
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:00.684]  That support the American people and your soldiers?
[01:50:01.125 --> 01:50:07.254]  Or are you going to stand with the billionaire crowd, special interests, scumbags like Gates and Schwab and Soros?
[01:50:07.675 --> 01:50:09.257]  Or, you know, I mean, are you doing that?
[01:50:09.277 --> 01:50:10.019]  Or are you coming?
[01:50:10.039 --> 01:50:11.421]  Are you going to take care of your people?
[01:50:12.712 --> 01:50:13.573]  And let's be clear here.
[01:50:13.894 --> 01:50:15.395]  I don't blame Trump for this.
[01:50:15.535 --> 01:50:18.879]  I'd like to think that Trump was duped into this and he was well-meaning.
[01:50:19.460 --> 01:50:26.647]  But his commitment to the promotion of Operation Warp Speed and these vaccines is a horrible stance to take.
[01:50:27.488 --> 01:50:29.691]  And Trump needs to have a reconciliation period.
[01:50:30.291 --> 01:50:34.154]  And he needs to come out and say, hey, you know, I wanted to rush the vaccine.
[01:50:34.194 --> 01:50:35.655]  I was told this disease was going to be deadly.
[01:50:35.935 --> 01:50:37.777]  I don't even care if he comes out and says he was fooled.
[01:50:38.657 --> 01:50:41.639]  It would humble himself, in my opinion, to do such.
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:48.645]  But if he starts campaigning and talking about how great Operation Warp Speed and these vaccines are, the boo-birds are going to keep happening.
[01:50:49.165 --> 01:50:50.646]  His rallies are going to lose attendance.
[01:50:50.686 --> 01:50:51.807]  He's going to lose support.
[01:50:52.227 --> 01:51:00.653]   And it's going to become this thing as we approach a presidential election in three years of like, hey, How can I support Trump when he's promoting this death vaccine?
[01:51:02.294 --> 01:51:04.855]  You know, I support a lot of what President Trump did.
[01:51:04.915 --> 01:51:07.457]  I think he's a good guy and I think you're exactly right.
[01:51:07.497 --> 01:51:13.000]  And I've asked a lot of people and it appears that he's been lied to and pushed by some people real close to him.
[01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:15.910]  But I'm 100% with you.
[01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:18.131]  You cannot deny this anymore.
[01:51:18.211 --> 01:51:19.971]  I've got soldiers who've blown the whistle.
[01:51:20.131 --> 01:51:21.532]  We've got Pfizer's own data.
[01:51:21.852 --> 01:51:23.292]  We've got all this information.
[01:51:23.452 --> 01:51:24.553]  We know what's happening.
[01:51:25.093 --> 01:51:29.234]  And we need the President to start saving some lives by coming out swinging on this.
[01:51:29.755 --> 01:51:32.435]  It's too late for him to say, well, you know, it's your choice.
[01:51:32.796 --> 01:51:33.856]  It's not your choice.
[01:51:34.216 --> 01:51:36.817]  We don't allow children to buy chainsaws.
[01:51:37.297 --> 01:51:39.638]  We don't allow people to play with hand grenades.
[01:51:40.198 --> 01:51:46.681]  It's not your choice to put a dangerous product on the market that there's no liability for, right?
[01:51:46.862 --> 01:51:51.544]  If we could sue these guys and they wanted to put it out there, well, then I guess there's that.
[01:51:52.084 --> 01:51:55.526]  But even then, there's no informed consent.
[01:51:55.846 --> 01:51:59.408]  Can you tell me, you just looked at that list of side effects, right?
[01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:03.070]  That list of side effects are potential side effects.
[01:52:03.110 --> 01:52:04.850]  They were known potential side effects.
[01:52:05.150 --> 01:52:06.310]  Did anybody see those?
[01:52:06.590 --> 01:52:13.551]  When you want to get your jab, did anybody listening to this have anybody say, hey, here's the list of side effects.
[01:52:13.571 --> 01:52:14.591]  Do you still want the jab?
[01:52:15.032 --> 01:52:15.292]  No.
[01:52:15.352 --> 01:52:20.993]  You got, well, you might have a sore arm, you might be sick for a day or two, but there's no real side effects and nobody's dying.
[01:52:21.453 --> 01:52:29.174]  Anthony Fauci is a scumbag lying murderer who is now going to be responsible for the deaths of thousands and thousands of Americans.
[01:52:31.328 --> 01:52:36.793]  When we come back from this next break with Thomas Renz, I want to ask him, what is next?
[01:52:36.873 --> 01:52:37.913]  What's the next move?
[01:52:38.394 --> 01:52:39.074]  What is he thinking?
[01:52:39.114 --> 01:52:44.379]  Because here was my response when this came out yesterday, was, all right, let's get the great guests on, like Thomas Renz.
[01:52:44.619 --> 01:52:49.123]  Let's get the great doctors on, like Dr. Peter McCullough, Dr. Artis, Dr. Marbles, and all of them.
[01:52:49.383 --> 01:52:50.464]  They're coming up tomorrow.
[01:52:50.804 --> 01:52:53.867]  So that was my next move, is, OK, we've got the data now.
[01:52:53.907 --> 01:52:55.067]  Let's get the doctor's response.
[01:52:55.088 --> 01:52:57.369]  Let's get their take on this.
[01:52:57.409 --> 01:52:58.450]  Let's see what they have to think.
[01:52:58.730 --> 01:53:00.192]  Let's keep moving this ball forward.
[01:53:01.425 --> 01:53:06.207]  Because the vaccine mandates are kind of slowly dying, but that doesn't mean the fight's over.
[01:53:06.307 --> 01:53:08.128]  The people that did this need to be held accountable.
[01:53:09.569 --> 01:53:10.749]  Thomas Renz is with us.
[01:53:12.610 --> 01:53:16.672]  He's an attorney fighting for truth when it comes to these vaccines.
[01:53:16.692 --> 01:53:24.595]  He was part of the, in my view, historic second opinion hearing that Senator Ron Johnson hosted.
[01:53:25.215 --> 01:53:26.176]  Thank God for that.
[01:53:27.387 --> 01:53:29.909]  And so I want to ask him, what's next?
[01:53:29.949 --> 01:53:34.774]  When he saw the data come out and he's had some time to review it, he's going to continue reviewing it.
[01:53:35.214 --> 01:53:42.500]  You know, Tom, my first response was, OK, time to get the doctors back on, time to get all the guests back on that have been talking about this.
[01:53:43.762 --> 01:53:47.104]  Not to take a victory lap about vindication, but to say, OK.
[01:53:48.464 --> 01:53:51.486]  Now that we have all the data and we've been proven right, what do we do next?
[01:53:52.447 --> 01:53:55.369]  How do we strategize to hold the people responsible?
[01:53:55.409 --> 01:53:58.292]  How do we strategize to get the public to be aware of what just happened?
[01:53:58.732 --> 01:54:02.735]  So when all this came out yesterday, what were you thinking?
[01:54:02.795 --> 01:54:14.044]  What's your next step in this journey to hold the people accountable that made this deadly vaccine, released it to the public, covered it up, and make the people aware of all of it?
[01:54:15.865 --> 01:54:20.006]  Well, I think you hit the nail on the head there when you said accountability.
[01:54:21.046 --> 01:54:24.227]  Accountability is the next step, and we'd actually already shifted to that.
[01:54:24.347 --> 01:54:32.249]  So after the second opinion hearing that Senator Johnson did, we saw that the narrative was done.
[01:54:32.289 --> 01:54:33.029]  It was crumbling.
[01:54:33.069 --> 01:54:33.829]  It was going down.
[01:54:33.949 --> 01:54:36.509]  And so we actually internally have already shifted.
[01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:42.351]  What we're doing now is we got early intel that they were going to say, OK, COVID's over.
[01:54:42.411 --> 01:54:42.991]  Let's move on.
[01:54:43.051 --> 01:54:43.751]  Nothing to see here.
[01:54:44.671 --> 01:54:47.375]  So that's absolutely unacceptable.
[01:54:47.435 --> 01:54:53.183]  We're going to have hundreds of millions of people globally that are going to have lifelong health troubles for the mess.
[01:54:53.584 --> 01:54:58.731]  We have millions of people globally that have already died from these horrible, horrible jabs.
[01:54:59.404 --> 01:55:03.947]  So we have to absolutely make sure that there's accountability.
[01:55:03.967 --> 01:55:07.250]  There's going to have to be tribunals on this.
[01:55:07.810 --> 01:55:09.031]  I don't see how else we can do it.
[01:55:09.051 --> 01:55:09.991]  I mean, don't get me wrong.
[01:55:10.992 --> 01:55:16.376]  My next steps are along with really trying to force the hands of these elected people to take a stand.
[01:55:17.370 --> 01:55:20.013]  Uh, we're also going to be suing everybody over everything, right?
[01:55:20.494 --> 01:55:25.439]  And by the way, just in case anybody's not aware, we've got very strong evidence.
[01:55:25.459 --> 01:55:26.921]  We're working with Andrew Huff.
[01:55:27.522 --> 01:55:30.024]  Uh, you know, we're working with our military people.
[01:55:30.044 --> 01:55:31.386]  We're working with all sorts of people.
[01:55:31.866 --> 01:55:33.308]  You know, this was created in the lab.
[01:55:33.769 --> 01:55:36.632]  So, Anthony Fauci funded this being created in the lab.
[01:55:37.282 --> 01:55:39.963]  We know that there were government agencies involved.
[01:55:39.983 --> 01:55:41.023]  We'll get to that later.
[01:55:42.004 --> 01:55:44.564]  You know, they created this and they created a cure.
[01:55:44.884 --> 01:55:46.965]  I mean, the whole thing was sick from beginning to end.
[01:55:46.985 --> 01:55:49.306]  So we've got to hold all of these people accountable.
[01:55:50.526 --> 01:55:52.407]  And there has to be a transparent reckoning.
[01:55:53.107 --> 01:56:02.250]   You know, it can't just be a, well, You know, we see that we've got this information and you know, okay, we were wrong.
[01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.870]  We're going to move on.
[01:56:02.890 --> 01:56:16.514]  No, no, we need the bureaucrats in Washington, the entirety of the FDA that's had anything to do with this needs to be held accountable from anyone who's had anything to do with anything from the poison PCR tests.
[01:56:18.823 --> 01:56:20.784]  To the deadly vaccines.
[01:56:21.064 --> 01:56:23.024]  All of these people have to be held accountable.
[01:56:23.444 --> 01:56:24.544]  There has to be trials.
[01:56:24.604 --> 01:56:28.906]  And the only way that I think that we can recover as a world, because guess what?
[01:56:29.526 --> 01:56:30.866]  All the truth is going to come out.
[01:56:30.906 --> 01:56:32.186]  We're going to make darn sure of it.
[01:56:32.606 --> 01:56:41.929]  And I don't see a way for the world to recover unless we have true transparent trials where there's accountability from beginning to end for everyone involved in this.
[01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:47.830]   Do you need cooperation from Congress to really So I mean, don't get me wrong.
[01:56:47.850 --> 01:56:49.290]  I'm going to sue everybody for everything.
[01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:51.311]  I cannot wait to sue everybody for everything.
[01:56:51.331 --> 01:56:54.251]  And I think we've got enough to really start throwing some real big lawsuits out there.
[01:56:54.271 --> 01:56:57.012]  So we're going to be doing that in the next couple weeks.
[01:56:56.832 --> 01:57:02.131]   in the private sector, aka Congress and attorneys, to make something like this happen?
[01:57:02.131 --> 01:57:03.572]  So, I mean, don't get me wrong.
[01:57:03.572 --> 01:57:05.231]  I'm gonna sue everybody for everything.
[01:57:05.231 --> 01:57:08.731]   I cannot wait to sue everybody for everything, and I think we've got enough to really start
[01:57:08.731 --> 01:57:11.212]  throwing some real big lawsuits out there.
[01:57:11.212 --> 01:57:13.811]  So we're gonna be doing that in the next couple weeks.
[01:57:13.811 --> 01:57:16.711]   You know, we're gonna be working on getting that stuff together.
[01:57:16.711 --> 01:57:24.392]   We're also going to be really pushing for that public-private partnership, right?
[01:57:24.278 --> 01:57:30.682]  What you're talking about and what I'm talking about here is, yeah, we do need official action, okay?
[01:57:30.802 --> 01:57:32.083]  I can't put someone in jail.
[01:57:32.283 --> 01:57:33.364]  I'm not a prosecutor.
[01:57:34.312 --> 01:57:38.615]  I can sue him for billions of dollars, and I'm going to, but I can't put him in jail.
[01:57:39.015 --> 01:57:42.898]  What I think we need to have is we need to have tribunals.
[01:57:43.318 --> 01:57:46.901]  There needs to be, everybody's talked about Nuremberg 2.0, well guess what?
[01:57:47.401 --> 01:57:52.105]  This is quite literally the most egregious crime against humanity since World War II.
[01:57:52.945 --> 01:58:01.208]  And, you know, when it's all said and done, I'll be, I mean, I don't know what the death toll from these jabs and, you know, because remember, it's not just the jabs.
[01:58:01.629 --> 01:58:03.770]  They've denied early ineffective treatment.
[01:58:03.850 --> 01:58:04.450]  We know that.
[01:58:04.930 --> 01:58:06.551]  They've pushed these poison jabs.
[01:58:06.611 --> 01:58:07.751]  They created this disease.
[01:58:07.791 --> 01:58:13.473]  The total death toll on this could well approach what we saw in World War II before it's all done.
[01:58:13.954 --> 01:58:16.875]  I mean, so this is a global crisis.
[01:58:17.575 --> 01:58:21.318]  And we have to globally come together and we need to put these people in jail.
[01:58:21.759 --> 01:58:29.365]  But I'm going to tell you, America's got some serious housecleaning to do on this because our country is behind a lot of what's happened on this.
[01:58:29.565 --> 01:58:33.909]  Not our country, but the people, the scumbags, the corrupt bureaucrats.
[01:58:34.409 --> 01:58:40.295]  The corrupt industrial complex that we have, these people have to be held accountable.
[01:58:40.656 --> 01:58:42.097]  They have to be put in jail.
[01:58:42.578 --> 01:58:45.461]  And yes, I can sue them, but we need jail time.
[01:58:45.681 --> 01:58:46.862]  We need accountability.
[01:58:47.243 --> 01:58:50.266]  Because what else is there to bring?
[01:58:50.286 --> 01:58:53.501]   If there's no justice, What are you going to do?
[01:58:53.861 --> 01:59:04.947]  As people start seeing their children dying from this, as they start seeing their family members dying from this, do you think it's going to be enough to say, well, here's a couple grand that we won as part of a huge class action?
[01:59:05.767 --> 01:59:06.828]  That's just not going to cut it.
[01:59:06.888 --> 01:59:08.949]  We need to hold these people accountable.
[01:59:11.162 --> 01:59:15.903]  You know this better than I, but I mean, there's things like involuntary manslaughter.
[01:59:15.963 --> 01:59:17.303]  I mean, what's the one with the industrial?
[01:59:17.323 --> 01:59:22.544]  It's like industrial... What's the thing I'm thinking of?
[01:59:22.564 --> 01:59:30.566]  It's like industrial malfeasance or something where, I mean, you can't have something malfunction and kill somebody and not get punished for it.
[01:59:30.586 --> 01:59:32.967]  I mean, there's all kinds of legal precedent on this.
[01:59:33.467 --> 01:59:35.067]  How does that apply to these vaccines?
[01:59:36.782 --> 01:59:38.603]  The very short version is this.
[01:59:39.003 --> 01:59:40.944]  So legally, they were given immunity.
[01:59:41.245 --> 01:59:44.646]  You know, you can't sue a vaccine manufacturer, but there's an out, right?
[01:59:45.807 --> 01:59:47.228]  If it's willful, you can.
[01:59:48.228 --> 02:00:00.815]  So, I mean, I don't know how much more willful you can get than sending the FDA a document that says there's a 3% mortality rate and, you know, I don't know, a huge, huge percentage of people with adverse reactions.
[02:00:01.557 --> 02:00:05.401]  And, you know, expect that that's not going to be considered willful.
[02:00:05.521 --> 02:00:07.763]  I mean, especially at this point.
[02:00:07.983 --> 02:00:11.226]  I mean, if they came out right now and said, hey, we've got a major problem.
[02:00:11.286 --> 02:00:12.607]  We're going to not give the vaccines anymore.
[02:00:12.627 --> 02:00:17.732]  We're going to pull it like they pulled the Johnson and Johnson and shot after like two months of it coming out, they pulled it.
[02:00:18.092 --> 02:00:21.675]  I mean, maybe if they did that, they could keep their immunity.
[02:00:21.936 --> 02:00:26.680]  But at this point, if they keep selling these vaccines, I don't think they have that immunity anymore.
[02:00:28.328 --> 02:00:30.629]  No, I don't think they have that immunity at all.
[02:00:30.990 --> 02:00:39.755]  I don't think they've had it anyways, because as soon as they sent this report in, which is not yesterday, it's a while ago, we know that they've known about this from the beginning.
[02:00:40.175 --> 02:00:40.596]  We know.
[02:00:40.896 --> 02:00:41.696]  There's no question.
[02:00:42.177 --> 02:00:48.801]  The first post-release study that they put out there showed this being a disaster.
[02:00:49.401 --> 02:00:50.281]  And it's all of these.
[02:00:50.401 --> 02:00:53.042]  It's anything that's a gene therapy, and all of these are.
[02:00:53.623 --> 02:00:56.464]  You know, this is the big thing, and that's where the big money is.
[02:00:56.484 --> 02:00:58.244]  Oh, we need gene therapy, gene therapy.
[02:00:58.424 --> 02:01:00.245]  Well, no, we don't need gene therapy.
[02:01:00.985 --> 02:01:03.486]  Our genes are fine, except for when you screw with them.
[02:01:04.066 --> 02:01:09.068]  You know, what we need is we need treatments for diseases that actually cure them rather than treat them.
[02:01:09.548 --> 02:01:14.590]  But you've got to understand, this is all part of the pharma complex.
[02:01:14.650 --> 02:01:17.951]  Pharma is the most corrupt industry on the planet, which is saying something.
[02:01:18.536 --> 02:01:22.479]  You know, what pharma does is take cancer, right?
[02:01:22.819 --> 02:01:25.641]  How many billions of dollars have we put into dealing with cancer?
[02:01:26.081 --> 02:01:28.403]  Pharma doesn't develop cures, they develop treatments.
[02:01:28.463 --> 02:01:29.984]  If you cure cancer, guess what?
[02:01:30.024 --> 02:01:31.725]  There's no more income because it's gone.
[02:01:32.385 --> 02:01:34.467]  So there's a ton of money in treatments.
[02:01:34.487 --> 02:01:39.130]  But if you cause cancer with vaccines, now you're even, now you're really jacking up your profits.
[02:01:40.391 --> 02:01:44.253]  Well, you know, the more illnesses you've got, the more things you can treat.
[02:01:44.413 --> 02:01:46.815]  And look at all these illnesses they're vaccines cause.
[02:01:46.835 --> 02:01:48.216]  I got an encyclopedia of them.
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:50.801]  Yep, yep.
[02:01:51.261 --> 02:01:52.182]  No question about it.
[02:01:52.242 --> 02:01:57.266]  Listen, I gotta tell you, we're not done.
[02:01:57.767 --> 02:02:09.396]  My team, my people, my part in this ends when all these people are in jail and there's some sort of accountability and there's some sort of a solution and justice for the people who have been injured and hurt by this.
[02:02:09.456 --> 02:02:12.159]  So we'll be lucky to see my job end in my lifetime.
[02:02:12.779 --> 02:02:25.786]  I tell you what though, we're going after all the corruption and I can't wait because we're going to end COVID and we're going after my job, the way I see it, is God's given me an opportunity to fight and destroy corruption in this country.
[02:02:26.267 --> 02:02:27.067]  That's what I'm doing.
[02:02:28.308 --> 02:02:29.989]  Thomas Renz, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:30.409 --> 02:02:31.830]  God bless and Godspeed.
[02:02:32.987 --> 02:02:36.211]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, my final segment here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:02:36.231 --> 02:02:37.733]  I'm going to be back hosting the War Room.
[02:02:37.753 --> 02:02:40.756]  I'm going to get into all the latest Ukraine stuff in this stack of news.
[02:02:41.117 --> 02:02:42.598]  Just all the other news I didn't get to.
[02:02:42.618 --> 02:02:44.520]  I may even have some time for some phone calls.
[02:02:44.581 --> 02:02:55.941]   But let me just explain something and this is why I get frustrated because they write hit pieces now about me and they say, oh look, InfoWars is pro-Russia propaganda.
[02:02:56.361 --> 02:02:57.983]  Oh, InfoWars is this, InfoWars is that.
[02:02:58.283 --> 02:03:00.406]  No, I want to hear all sides of the story.
[02:03:01.106 --> 02:03:05.932]  I want to hear what Russians say, I want to hear what Ukrainians say, I want to hear what Polish say, I want to hear what everybody has to say.
[02:03:08.527 --> 02:03:27.035]  And so that's all I'm doing is I'm just sourcing out as much material as I possibly can to not form a conclusion necessarily about what's going on in Ukraine, but just to have a perspective that isn't the force-fed mainstream media narrative that I just know is a lie because it's the same liars that lie about everything else.
[02:03:28.756 --> 02:03:35.479]  So here is the general that Tucker Carlson has continued to have on General McGregor discussing this.
[02:03:36.820 --> 02:03:42.843]  Which I think is just fair, neutral commentary, and I'm going to really kind of put it all together on the war room today.
[02:03:43.643 --> 02:03:50.326]  But this was, and then so, but they're so mad, they're so mad that Tucker Carlson won't just pound the war drums against Russia.
[02:03:50.526 --> 02:04:00.871]  They're so mad because Infowars won't pound the war drums against Russia, and because we're actually putting out a historical, accurate perspective of all this stuff that isn't just the mainstream media narrative drivel.
[02:04:02.148 --> 02:04:03.089]  That angers them.
[02:04:03.129 --> 02:04:04.311]  They don't like us on air.
[02:04:04.371 --> 02:04:05.533]  They want war.
[02:04:06.394 --> 02:04:08.297]  I don't get it, but that's what they want.
[02:04:08.958 --> 02:04:11.761]  And so here is General McGregor on Tucker Carlson last night.
[02:04:12.506 --> 02:04:14.688]  So the first question is, where are we now?
[02:04:14.708 --> 02:04:18.292]  We keep hearing these reports about a Russian convoy coming into the capital city, etc, etc.
[02:04:18.312 --> 02:04:20.994]  But big picture, where is the war as of tonight?
[02:04:21.575 --> 02:04:28.101]  Well, the first five days, we witnessed a very slow, methodical movement of Russian forces into eastern Ukraine.
[02:04:28.621 --> 02:04:33.646]  That is Ukraine, the third of Ukraine, which is on the eastern side of this river called the Dnieper.
[02:04:34.347 --> 02:04:45.155]   They moved slowly, cautiously, they tried to reduce Casualties among the civilian population, trying to give as many Ukrainian troops and forces as possible the opportunity to give up, to surrender.
[02:04:45.876 --> 02:04:46.496]  That is over.
[02:04:46.876 --> 02:04:55.523]  And the phase in which we find ourselves now, Russian forces have now maneuvered to encircle and surround the remaining Ukrainian forces and destroy them.
[02:04:56.123 --> 02:05:07.171]  Through a series of massive rocket artillery strikes, airstrikes, with Russian armor then slowly but surely closing the distance and annihilating what's left.
[02:05:07.691 --> 02:05:12.773]  So this is the beginning, frankly, of the end of Ukrainian resistance.
[02:05:13.794 --> 02:05:15.255]  So the ugly stuff is just beginning?
[02:05:15.355 --> 02:05:15.835]  Yes.
[02:05:17.316 --> 02:05:24.899]  So this is a question you don't often hear asked, but it's essential to our welfare here in the United States, to our strategic thinking about this.
[02:05:25.319 --> 02:05:27.140]  What is Putin's goal here?
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:27.921]  What's his aim?
[02:05:29.056 --> 02:05:33.479]  Well, I think Vladimir Putin set out to honor his word of 2007.
[02:05:33.519 --> 02:05:46.087]  2007, at the Munich Security Conference, he said, we will not tolerate the expansion of NATO into a point where your NATO, your border, is touching Russia.
[02:05:46.767 --> 02:05:48.688]  Specifically, Ukraine and Georgia.
[02:05:49.308 --> 02:05:54.111]  We see these as essentially Trojan horses for NATO's military power and U.S.
[02:05:54.151 --> 02:05:56.293]  influence, subversion and so forth.
[02:05:57.837 --> 02:06:28.894]   He then turned to several opportunities to reinforce that over and over and over again, most recently with President Biden, in the hopes that he could avoid taking action to effectively clean out Eastern Ukraine of any opposition forces whatsoever, and to put his forces in a position vis-a-vis NATO to deter us from any further attempts to influence or change Ukraine into effectively a platform For the projection of US and Western power into Russia.
[02:06:29.735 --> 02:06:35.519]  Now his goal, as we see it at the moment, is to seize this entire area of Eastern Ukraine.
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:36.720]  That's pretty clear.
[02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:39.162]  He's going to roll up to that river, up near Kiev.
[02:06:39.622 --> 02:06:44.386]  He's actually moved over the river and is preparing to go in and capture that city entirely.
[02:06:45.146 --> 02:06:49.049]  At that point, he has to decide what else he wants to do.
[02:06:49.069 --> 02:06:51.251]  I don't think he wants to go any further west.
[02:06:51.331 --> 02:06:53.613]  I think he'd be very satisfied to hold that point.
[02:06:54.253 --> 02:07:08.519]  But he would like whatever emerges from this that we call Ukraine, whether it's just the Western side, or it encompasses some of the East and the West of Ukraine, to be neutral, non-aligned, and preferably friendly to Moscow.
[02:07:09.560 --> 02:07:10.420]  That he will accept.
[02:07:11.461 --> 02:07:14.162]  Anything short of that, his war's been a waste of time.
[02:07:15.786 --> 02:07:17.948]  How should the United States respond at this point?
[02:07:18.389 --> 02:07:26.516]  Well, I think President Biden and Sullivan, his National Security Advisor, have already given some indication of their readiness to accept something like that.
[02:07:27.157 --> 02:07:28.558]  They're not going to have any choice.
[02:07:29.539 --> 02:07:36.585]  Either they accept it, or then they put him in the position of having to do more than he would like to do, which would probably not go down well with NATO.
[02:07:36.685 --> 02:07:40.249]  No one really wants Russian forces on their border, least of all Poland.
[02:07:40.649 --> 02:07:40.829]  Right.
[02:07:41.289 --> 02:07:57.719]  So I think Sullivan and Biden will essentially tell Zelensky, if he is still the president at that point, and if he's still running any semblance of the Ukrainian government, which is largely collapsing now, if he is still there, he's going to be told, accept the deal.
[02:07:58.519 --> 02:07:59.100]  Go neutral.
[02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:01.261]  Because there really is no choice.
[02:08:03.587 --> 02:08:12.918]  So the mainstream media narrative that they love to tell you, oh Ukraine's winning, oh they're so heroic, oh Snake Island, that was a lie, oh the ghost of Kiev, that was a lie.
[02:08:13.879 --> 02:08:17.043]  Oh look at Zelensky, he's a hero, he's so brave.
[02:08:18.625 --> 02:08:38.301]   And there's other aspects of this too, like for example, and this is the real This is the understanding that people need to have, and I'm going to try to make this quick because I'm really going to delve into this in the war room and dedicate like an hour and a half to all of this, but strategically speaking, look at it like this.
[02:08:39.021 --> 02:08:41.084]  Ukraine is some 44 million people.
[02:08:42.344 --> 02:08:47.865]  Ukraine, I believe, has the fourth largest oil pipeline network in the world.
[02:08:48.225 --> 02:08:48.825]  That's huge.
[02:08:49.365 --> 02:08:54.866]  So, I mean, if you're Russia and you want to have another strategic advantage, you want control of Ukraine, you want to control those pipelines.
[02:08:55.346 --> 02:08:59.807]  Ukraine is also rich in, they export all kinds of goods.
[02:08:59.867 --> 02:09:12.451]   I was actually surprised at all the different goods that Ukraine exports that are, like, top ten in the planet that they export, including really essential Uh, minerals and goods and all kinds of stuff comes out of Ukraine.
[02:09:12.491 --> 02:09:48.775]   So, so that's a strategic thing, where Russia's already, the New World Order's already tried to crush Russia, sanctioned them to death, isolated them off the map and all of this different stuff, and Russia simply sees it as, look, either we take Ukraine back from the globalists, the globo-homos, either we, we take Ukraine back, And don't let them become a NATO-EU nation that's just going to continue to crush us, and we get control of those pipelines, we get control of that economy, okay, Russia can survive, and can continue to push back against the expansion of the global homos.
[02:09:50.096 --> 02:10:01.121]  And if they can't, I mean, Putin, look, who knows what really Putin thinks about this behind the scenes, because he hasn't been fully honest about his aspirations, obviously, but, is Putin basically on a suicide mission?
[02:10:01.401 --> 02:10:04.743]  To either go down as the greatest Russian leader of all time, or to die trying?
[02:10:06.052 --> 02:10:07.973]  Because that's what it appears to look like now.
[02:10:09.114 --> 02:10:17.218]  And he views it as, either I make this stand right now, against NATO and the globalists, or Russia's going to be crushed forever.
[02:10:18.499 --> 02:10:26.923]  And if we don't have the strategic asset of Ukraine, then we have nothing.
[02:10:27.284 --> 02:10:33.167]  Because if it comes down to it, they'll start pumping more oil out of the US, or whatever it is, to tank Russia.
[02:10:34.582 --> 02:10:36.323]  But you've got to wonder, why aren't we pumping oil?
[02:10:36.383 --> 02:10:37.264]  Is it not ours?
[02:10:37.304 --> 02:10:41.706]  Did somebody cut a secret deal where our oil is not our oil and that's why we can't have it?
[02:10:41.906 --> 02:10:42.827]  But that's a side issue.
[02:10:45.428 --> 02:10:54.994]  So that's, that's the strategery beyond just the Holy Russian War, as Putin calls it, that's going down in Ukraine right now.
[02:10:55.054 --> 02:11:00.257]  But, Kate Daly is about to take over here on the fourth hour.
[02:11:00.277 --> 02:11:03.699]  We're going to have a special report from Greg Rees before she takes over.
[02:11:05.376 --> 02:11:11.677]  And then I'm gonna be coming back hosting the War Room and I'm gonna dedicate probably another hour, hour and a half to actually getting into all the latest Ukraine stuff.
[02:11:14.038 --> 02:11:17.159]  But, uh, that's what's going on.
[02:11:17.279 --> 02:11:24.160]  And that's why you see all the news like, oh, look at Ukraine, they're intolerant of gay people, they're intolerant of transsexual people, that's because of Russia.
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:26.501]  By the way, here's another thing they don't tell you.
[02:11:27.367 --> 02:11:30.169]  A lot of Ukrainians are actually Russia loyalists, folks.
[02:11:30.829 --> 02:11:32.190]  Especially on Eastern Ukraine.
[02:11:32.770 --> 02:11:34.411]  They are Russia loyalists.
[02:11:35.112 --> 02:11:42.156]  And then you have this other weird dynamic of a lot of people in Ukraine don't believe Zelensky is the real president.
[02:11:42.196 --> 02:11:44.197]  They think Zelensky is an illegitimate president.
[02:11:44.497 --> 02:11:46.098]  And do you know what the media calls them?
[02:11:47.118 --> 02:11:48.739]  Ukrainian nationalists.
[02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:50.380]  Sound familiar?
[02:11:51.901 --> 02:11:52.642]  Sound familiar?
[02:11:53.863 --> 02:11:59.106]  So there's a lot of stuff out there you're not seeing or hearing, folks, and I'm going to try to break it all down when I come back and host the War Room.
[02:11:59.846 --> 02:12:04.088]  But we couldn't do any of this if it wasn't for your support at InfoWarStore.com.

[02:13:34.615 --> 02:13:38.016]   If you haven't tried these products, you really need to because they are amazing.
[02:13:38.016 --> 02:13:39.016]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:13:39.016 --> 02:13:57.257]  [Music]
[02:13:57.784 --> 02:14:00.507]  And if the American people knew the truth about U.S.
[02:14:00.588 --> 02:14:05.474]  interference in Ukraine, they might not be so eager to start World War III.
[02:14:06.536 --> 02:14:10.061]  During World War II, Western Ukraine sided with the Nazis.
[02:14:10.942 --> 02:14:19.870]  After the war, the CIA helped Ukrainian Nazis evade the Nuremberg Trials and began operating with them within the Ukraine.
[02:14:20.611 --> 02:14:25.456]  After decades of CIA infiltration, the Ukrainian People's Movement emerged in 1989.
[02:14:27.337 --> 02:14:32.782]  And gave birth to extremist groups, Svoboda, Trident, and Right Sector.
[02:14:33.482 --> 02:14:37.145]  Neo-Nazi groups pushing for the ethnic cleansing of Ukraine.
[02:14:37.726 --> 02:14:41.669]  Extremist groups cultivated by the CIA, supported by the U.S.
[02:14:41.689 --> 02:14:46.093]  State Department, and used by the IMF to bring Ukraine to heel.
[02:14:47.354 --> 02:15:05.805]  When Yanukovych beat NATO-backed Yushchenko in the 2010 elections, his government was being pressured into signing an EU Association Agreement by the International Monetary Fund in their typical conquer-by-debt offer that would financially ruin the Ukraine and place them at the mercy of the World Bank.
[02:15:05.845 --> 02:15:08.967]  Yanukovych declined their offer.
[02:15:10.048 --> 02:15:14.051]  And in today's corrupt world, you're not allowed to say no to the IMF.
[02:15:15.825 --> 02:15:25.586]  Funded by Western NGOs associated with George Soros and the CIA, a highly organized color revolution was immediately deployed against Yanukovych.
[02:15:26.684 --> 02:15:40.815]  Organizations such as the National Endowment for Democracy trained activist journalists to utilize Facebook along with three brand new television networks created within weeks to recruit people for the protests.
[02:15:41.515 --> 02:15:45.218]  This Western-run media campaign was a huge success.
[02:15:45.919 --> 02:15:47.160]  The turnout was massive.
[02:15:49.122 --> 02:15:59.308]  The CIA has been orchestrating revolutions their entire career, and the first step to their simple formula is to convince people to take to the streets in peaceful protest.
[02:16:00.028 --> 02:16:09.314]  They then use agitators to goad the police into violence, and state-run media to ignite the crowd with emotionally charged reports of sacred victims.
[02:16:10.534 --> 02:16:16.576]  On November 30th, 2013, the Ukrainian Chief of Staff, associated closely with the U.S.
[02:16:16.596 --> 02:16:22.818]  State Department, ordered the streets to be cleared of protesters for the erection of the annual Christmas tree.
[02:16:23.398 --> 02:16:38.362]  When the police arrived, they were met by a highly aggressive and well-organized faction of Ukraine's right sector, who provoked the police into a violent reaction against peaceful protesters, which is all the Western intelligence media reported on.
[02:16:39.142 --> 02:16:45.369]  Predictably, this resulted in more unrest and violence, which was further fueled by U.S.
[02:16:45.430 --> 02:16:48.353]  Senator John McCain's support of the protests.
[02:16:49.254 --> 02:16:51.336]  Leaked phone calls reveal that the U.S.
[02:16:51.376 --> 02:16:55.481]  State Department was orchestrating this coup d'etat from within the U.S.
[02:16:55.601 --> 02:16:58.705]  Embassy with support from Vice President Joe Biden.
[02:17:00.430 --> 02:17:11.472]  On February 20th, unidentified snipers, firing from government buildings occupied by the protesters, began firing into the crowd, killing people on all sides.
[02:17:12.452 --> 02:17:28.915]  Yenikovik's home and offices were taken by armed mobs, and a new government was put into place with a neo-Nazi element that went on to accept the IMF's spurious loan offer, and began murdering the Russian-speaking population of Ukraine in Donbass.
[02:17:30.475 --> 02:17:37.919]  As a result of this Western-created quagmire, 96% of the people in Crimea voted in favor of joining Russia.
[02:17:38.720 --> 02:17:43.522]  And while the nation celebrated, Western media reported that they were invaded by Russia.
[02:17:44.082 --> 02:17:44.603]  Their proof?
[02:17:45.103 --> 02:17:48.284]  A Russian military presence, which has existed there since 1804.
[02:17:50.453 --> 02:17:54.335]  Supporting a criminal war against Russia does not make you a patriot.
[02:17:54.955 --> 02:17:58.537]  It makes you a useful idiot of the globalist banking cartel.
[02:17:58.917 --> 02:18:05.100]  The very same entities waging war on all of humanity with vaccine passports and experimental jabs.
[02:18:05.800 --> 02:18:09.282]  A righteous patriot would call out his government for war crimes.
[02:18:09.942 --> 02:18:16.806]  And through fraud and deceit, the United States government has been the world's biggest purveyor of war crimes for decades.
[02:18:17.606 --> 02:18:24.097]  All in the name of spreading McDonald's, genetically modified foods, and sexual perversions worldwide.
[02:18:25.199 --> 02:18:28.779]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[02:18:28.779 --> 02:18:44.258]  Hi, I'm Kate Dally, your guest host today.
[02:18:44.326 --> 02:18:45.386]  So glad to be with you.
[02:18:45.626 --> 02:18:48.047]  So much news, so little time to go over it.
[02:18:48.727 --> 02:18:52.329]  But I do want to invite my guest, Joel Skousen, on the show.
[02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:56.130]  He's been coming on my show for years and also on InfoWars.
[02:18:56.550 --> 02:18:58.191]  And so Joel Skousen will be joining me.
[02:18:58.231 --> 02:19:09.355]   He is the editor of WorldAffairsBrief.com and a political scientist by training, specializing in the philosophy of law, constitutional theory, Also a designer of high security residences and retreats.
[02:19:09.595 --> 02:19:14.296]  His latest book is Strategic Relocation, North American Guide to Safe Places.
[02:19:14.676 --> 02:19:17.977]  And of course, get your subscription to worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:19:18.297 --> 02:19:20.078]  Hi Joel, nice to be with you today.
[02:19:20.098 --> 02:19:22.838]  Nice to be with you, Kate.
[02:19:24.479 --> 02:19:28.940]  Well, get us up to speed on the situation in Ukraine and Russia.
[02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:31.921]  How you see it, what's going on up to now, up to today's news.
[02:19:36.826 --> 02:20:08.090]   It's awfully hard to get accurate information because both sides are, you know, promoting their version of victory, but the best that I can tell from legitimate military sources is that Russia has captured all of the Donbass region and the southern part is gone, but that it has turned to shelling cities now that they haven't been able to capture and they haven't been able to negotiate a surrender by the Ukrainian government yet, and so Kharkiv The center of the town has been destroyed by artillery.
[02:20:09.071 --> 02:20:20.456]  There's another city in the south, as well as Mariupol, which are under... But he's not... And this is clearly untrue.
[02:20:21.076 --> 02:20:22.517]  It's really a sad situation.
[02:20:22.557 --> 02:20:34.502]  But the war... Has... Essentially, the city is prepared to defend itself, and the javelin missiles that the US and NATO have sent out have been very effective.
[02:20:36.890 --> 02:20:37.611]  Russian tanks.
[02:20:38.231 --> 02:20:48.639]  So even though this would be over in a week or two, we mustn't underestimate the Ukraine resistance.
[02:20:48.719 --> 02:20:54.283]  It is toughening up and it looks like that Russians are going to have a tough time conquering the country.
[02:20:54.303 --> 02:20:57.826]  Are they using all the artillery they have?
[02:20:59.927 --> 02:21:01.709]  The forces are overwhelming eventually.
[02:21:01.729 --> 02:21:04.871]  We've got to remember that Putin has not put in his first line forces yet.
[02:21:06.063 --> 02:21:12.985]  He's put in a lot of T-72 tanks, knowing that they're going to absorb some losses with these Javelin missiles.
[02:21:13.045 --> 02:21:17.786]  He doesn't want to put in his top level tanks, which he doesn't have a lot there.
[02:21:17.826 --> 02:21:20.566]  The Armata tank is not in the game yet.
[02:21:22.207 --> 02:21:25.767]  Just T-72s and T-80s, which have limited effectiveness.
[02:21:27.468 --> 02:21:28.608]  Why do you think he's holding back?
[02:21:31.107 --> 02:21:34.690]  Well, one of the major reasons is to stop the U.S.
[02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:42.397]  from eavesdropping or detecting what his top-of-the-line military tactics and equipment are capable of doing.
[02:21:43.378 --> 02:21:54.947]  Remember, that's what the Russians were doing by allowing the war in Iraq to go forward, not defending Saddam Hussein like they claimed they were, because they wanted to eavesdrop on U.S.
[02:21:54.987 --> 02:22:03.229]   military effectiveness, especially gain The radar signatures and ECM or electronic countermeasure signatures that of the U.S.
[02:22:03.689 --> 02:22:08.934]  using for their air defense and to jam Soviet missiles.
[02:22:10.235 --> 02:22:12.777]  So the Russians are trying to deny the U.S.
[02:22:13.257 --> 02:22:14.018]  that information.
[02:22:14.078 --> 02:22:15.339]  I think that's one of the reasons.
[02:22:15.459 --> 02:22:27.909]  Other than the fact, too, that they want to keep their best in reserve until a lot of these weapons in Ukraine are used up so that their higher level tanks are not subject to destruction.
[02:22:30.174 --> 02:22:32.135]  So, what happens next with Russia?
[02:22:32.495 --> 02:22:35.497]  As far as Donbass goes, isn't a majority of that Russian?
[02:22:36.638 --> 02:22:36.858]  Right?
[02:22:37.758 --> 02:22:38.419]  That's correct.
[02:22:38.639 --> 02:22:50.866]  And, you know, the piece by Gregg Reese that was played in the intermission here was a very, very sophisticated piece of really dumb analysis and mixed truth and half-truths.
[02:22:51.507 --> 02:22:55.309]  I wish I had time to go through all of it in a transcript.
[02:22:55.329 --> 02:22:57.030]  But let me explain one of the first things.
[02:22:57.771 --> 02:23:01.815]  Remember that the boundaries of Ukraine were created by Russia, not the West.
[02:23:02.015 --> 02:23:06.979]  Russia is the one that put the Russian speaking sectors of Donbass in the borders of Ukraine.
[02:23:07.680 --> 02:23:19.110]  And that's the same reason they put Russians into the Baltic States, into Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, so that they'd have the excuse to intervene someday in the name of protecting the Russian minority.
[02:23:20.932 --> 02:23:22.013]  But it is not true.
[02:23:22.628 --> 02:23:27.451]  That the Ukrainians were killing the Russian minority.
[02:23:27.571 --> 02:23:28.871]  This was false claims.
[02:23:28.931 --> 02:23:39.377]  In fact, the artillery duel that started this war was started by the Russian forces, which used stealth forces dressed in civilian clothes to take over militarily the Donbass region.
[02:23:39.877 --> 02:23:44.020]  And they're the ones that started that artillery duel, which the Ukrainians responded.
[02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:49.683]  That's just what Putin wanted as the entree into justifying the beginning of this war.
[02:23:50.552 --> 02:23:56.896]  So we've got to remember that Russia has a vested interest in taking back the states of the former Soviet Union.
[02:23:58.097 --> 02:24:07.943]  One of the keys, and I might say that in Friday's World Affairs Brief, I'm going to cover the rash of bad analysis from the conservative right.
[02:24:09.084 --> 02:24:23.428]   And, you know, it's really sad when people who are legitimately anti-globalists can only see the globalist evil and tend to think that If globalists are against Putin, he must be the good guy.
[02:24:23.788 --> 02:24:26.469]  Or if the globalists are against China, they must be the good guy.
[02:24:27.210 --> 02:24:39.677]  Unfortunately, my good friend Ron Paul started this decades ago in his legitimate anti-interventionist policies against the neocons who were intervening in the Middle East.
[02:24:40.377 --> 02:24:46.141]  And he came to the conclusion that anybody the globalists must be fighting must be innocent or the good guys.
[02:24:46.241 --> 02:24:57.997]   Well, That was true to a certain extent in Syria and in Iraq he hadn't really attacked until we gave him the go-ahead to go into Ukraine.
[02:24:58.037 --> 02:25:00.458]  We set him up for the Iraq war.
[02:25:00.998 --> 02:25:02.339]  It wasn't true in Kosovo.
[02:25:02.379 --> 02:25:09.378]   We falsified the attack of the Serbians on the Kosovarian so that we could justify intervening there.
[02:25:09.378 --> 02:25:12.878]  So the globalists have done a lot of bad things, etc.
[02:25:12.878 --> 02:25:18.679]   But we mustn't underestimate the fact that Russia and China are building massive weapons of mass destruction.
[02:25:18.679 --> 02:25:20.439]  They're not defensive.
[02:25:20.439 --> 02:25:25.238]   They are not intended to, you know, because they think that the globalists are going to attack them,
[02:25:25.238 --> 02:25:29.878]   the globalists have to wait until Russia and China attack the West,
[02:25:29.878 --> 02:25:35.789]   which is going to give them the excuse to drive the United States out of American sovereignty into a militarized
[02:25:35.789 --> 02:25:37.879]  global government in response.
[02:25:38.129 --> 02:25:48.696]  But there's two things that I use, Kate, to determine whether or not a conservative who's defending Putin against the so-called globalist intervention understands what's real.
[02:25:49.457 --> 02:25:52.839]  Number one, do they buy into the phony fall of the Soviet Union?
[02:25:53.119 --> 02:25:53.760]  They all do.
[02:25:54.380 --> 02:25:56.362]  They all talk about when the Soviet Union fell.
[02:25:56.402 --> 02:25:58.063]  Well, the Soviet Union never really fell.
[02:25:58.103 --> 02:25:59.724]  The communists just went underground.
[02:26:00.100 --> 02:26:01.501]  They faked their own demise.
[02:26:02.042 --> 02:26:06.565]  They gave orders to Eric Honecker to let the protests go forward in Leipzig.
[02:26:07.045 --> 02:26:11.128]  They gave orders to tear down the Berlin Wall or to allow the wall to be torn down.
[02:26:11.509 --> 02:26:19.775]  They gave orders to the various dictators to quit and to go into exile and only Nikolai Ceausescu refused and they shot him and they killed he and his wife.
[02:26:20.636 --> 02:26:21.597]  The communists shot him.
[02:26:22.737 --> 02:26:24.519]  So this was a phony coup.
[02:26:24.579 --> 02:26:29.863]  So was the claimed failed coup to capture Gorbachev in his undefended villa.
[02:26:30.791 --> 02:26:42.979]  I mean, we're to believe that the KGB had overthrown multiple governments, couldn't capture Gorbachev and his independent villa, and then the ministers of defense, KGB and GRU fled for their lives?
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:47.062]  Well, these are the people who hold the power over all military and law enforcement.
[02:26:47.082 --> 02:26:48.203]  Who are they fleeing from?
[02:26:48.223 --> 02:26:56.068]  Well, I and Christopher Story of the UK were the only journalists at that time that blew the whistle on this phony fall.
[02:26:56.738 --> 02:27:14.826]  But every one of the globalist publications and the mainstream media bought into it because it suited their globalist agenda, that is, to protect Russia from criticism and to allow the world to believe that communism had fallen so that we could open our doors to sending them aid and trade.
[02:27:14.886 --> 02:27:20.949]  We rebuilt the entire oil industry in Russia based on the phony fall of the Soviet Union.
[02:27:21.744 --> 02:27:27.268]  But believe me, KGB head, Colonel Vladimir Putin is not a Christian.
[02:27:28.208 --> 02:27:35.673]  He's building churches and attending church just to further this disinformation campaign that he's a Christian to fool American conservatives.
[02:27:35.713 --> 02:27:37.214]  And he's doing a pretty good job of it.
[02:27:37.234 --> 02:27:40.637]  And that's what worries me, is that Christians are buying into this.
[02:27:42.018 --> 02:28:03.805]   And the second thing, Kate, the most important thing in their recitation of why the CIA is guilty of creating this This problem in Ukraine is they claim that the CIA is the one who did this coup against legitimately elected President Yanukovych in 2014, where he had to flee for his life.
[02:28:04.926 --> 02:28:19.558]  Well, it is true that the Endowment for Democracy gave funds and gave aid and education to the people to foment part of this color revolution.
[02:28:20.612 --> 02:28:23.656]  The revolution would not... We'll come back.
[02:28:23.696 --> 02:28:25.178]  We'll talk about this in just a moment.
[02:28:25.238 --> 02:28:28.342]  More with Joel Skousen, my guest, Kate Dally Show.
[02:28:28.442 --> 02:28:30.285]  Kate Dally, I'm your co-host.
[02:28:30.525 --> 02:28:35.211]  And also, we have a lot to hear from Joel Skousen, editor of World Affairs Brief.
[02:28:35.231 --> 02:28:35.872]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:36.975 --> 02:28:40.820]  Hi, nice to be with you, Kate Dally from the Kate Dally Show, your guest host today.
[02:28:40.900 --> 02:28:42.923]  I really appreciate being here with you today.
[02:28:43.264 --> 02:28:46.728]  My guest is Joel Skousen, editor of World Affairs Brief.
[02:28:47.589 --> 02:28:52.396]  Joel, we were just talking about the money to maybe help the coup.
[02:28:53.096 --> 02:28:55.477]  And you were talking about Victoria Nuland.
[02:28:55.577 --> 02:29:00.518]  She had a leaked phone call in which some things came to light about the funding of that.
[02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:08.200]  We had Barack Obama admitting to CNN that he had brokered a deal for the transition of power in Ukraine.
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:12.681]  And then we have John Kerry talking about the billion dollars that went over.
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:15.360]  So what is your take on...
[02:29:15.360 --> 02:29:23.360]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:27.860]  So you blanked out on the feed.
[02:29:28.577 --> 02:29:29.957]  I didn't get the actual question.
[02:29:30.998 --> 02:29:34.400]  OK, so in 2014, who was behind the coup?
[02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:51.788]  Well, the key piece of information that is missing from all of these commentaries, and I covered it in 2014 when that coup actually happened, and it was in the Gregg Reese piece that I was objecting to at the beginning of this show.
[02:29:52.532 --> 02:30:00.896]  He talks about the protesters bursting forth and going and invading the presidential palace and then causing President Yanukovych to flee for his life.
[02:30:01.516 --> 02:30:14.382]  But what he failed to mention, and this is the key point, is that the Berkut, the riot police in Ukraine, were ordered to stay in their barracks and there was no one surrounding the protesters.
[02:30:15.612 --> 02:30:19.735]  And all of the guards of the presidential palace stayed in their barracks.
[02:30:20.015 --> 02:30:21.916]  So the presidential palace was wide open.
[02:30:21.976 --> 02:30:25.098]  So was the Rada, the legislature, all the government buildings.
[02:30:25.999 --> 02:30:31.022]  And all the protesters as they were going through these things were saying, where are all the guards?
[02:30:32.243 --> 02:30:34.725]  It's the same thing during the phony fall of the Soviet Union.
[02:30:34.905 --> 02:30:40.028]  The student protesting in support of Yeltsin were saying, where's the KGB?
[02:30:40.068 --> 02:30:42.870]  They're usually shadowing us or arresting us when this was happening.
[02:30:43.550 --> 02:30:46.411]  Or the Stasi in the Leipzig student protests.
[02:30:46.431 --> 02:30:48.732]  The student protests were saying, where's the Stasi?
[02:30:49.352 --> 02:30:52.053]  Looking around over their shoulders to see if they were going to be arrested.
[02:30:52.073 --> 02:30:53.294]  They were nowhere to be found.
[02:30:53.754 --> 02:30:57.456]  Well, who could give orders to the Berkut to stay in their barracks?
[02:30:57.676 --> 02:30:58.956]  Could the CIA have done that?
[02:30:59.176 --> 02:30:59.737]  Not at all.
[02:31:00.557 --> 02:31:05.299]  It was Yanukovych who could only give the orders for them to stay in their barracks.
[02:31:05.939 --> 02:31:13.062]  You see, on the Thursday prior to this breakout, Yanukovych had called a leader of the so-called protest leaders.
[02:31:13.840 --> 02:31:16.281]  And the people in the streets said, these aren't our leaders.
[02:31:17.061 --> 02:31:18.042]  These are phony leaders.
[02:31:18.122 --> 02:31:25.205]  And, you know, Greg Reese made a big point about, you know, the CIA creating neo-Nazi parties all throughout the opposition.
[02:31:25.765 --> 02:31:28.746]  Well, there's no proof of that, actually, that these were created by the CIA.
[02:31:28.766 --> 02:31:30.147]  The Russians do the same thing.
[02:31:30.807 --> 02:31:32.508]  The Russians create neo-Nazi parties.
[02:31:32.528 --> 02:31:33.068]  The U.S.
[02:31:33.628 --> 02:31:35.609]  deep state creates neo-Nazi parties.
[02:31:35.649 --> 02:31:39.431]  There are no real neo-Nazis in the United States, all created by government.
[02:31:40.427 --> 02:31:48.533]  And this is the point is that why would the globalists give or hand Putin an excuse, which he used in the invasion of Korea to stop these neo-Nazis.
[02:31:49.214 --> 02:31:51.415]  Why would he, would they hand him this excuse?
[02:31:52.476 --> 02:32:01.943]  But here's the point is that the coup could not have succeeded were it not for Yanukovych for telling the Berkut, the riot police to stay in their barracks.
[02:32:02.003 --> 02:32:06.547]  That's proof that this was a phony coup, not a true coup.
[02:32:06.827 --> 02:32:08.028]  And what was the result of it?
[02:32:08.604 --> 02:32:14.229]  Piotr Poroshenko then came in as president, and he was a plant.
[02:32:14.309 --> 02:32:27.261]  He was a pro-Russian hack, friend of the various oligarchs of Putin, claiming to be pro-Ukrainian, promising the Russian people throughout Ukraine that they could speak their own language, that they would not be harassed.
[02:32:27.879 --> 02:32:32.484]  And as soon as he became president, he said they could, he antagonized them.
[02:32:32.524 --> 02:32:34.266]  He said, you can't speak your own language.
[02:32:34.747 --> 02:32:38.191]  He began to oppress them by saying, you know, you can't practice this and that.
[02:32:38.751 --> 02:32:40.193]  And you have to be under our control.
[02:32:40.353 --> 02:32:45.178]  He was doing that specifically to hand Putin the excuse, you know, to invade.
[02:32:45.639 --> 02:32:48.122]  So you see, Kate, these things are very complex.
[02:32:49.110 --> 02:32:51.813]  Both the Russians and our globalists are our enemies.
[02:32:52.474 --> 02:32:54.056]  Both of them use deception.
[02:32:54.296 --> 02:32:55.818]  Both are masters of deceit.
[02:32:55.998 --> 02:32:57.380]  Both play both sides.
[02:32:57.900 --> 02:33:00.563]  Both fund neo-Nazis to demonize.
[02:33:00.884 --> 02:33:02.786]  Both control opposition parties.
[02:33:03.567 --> 02:33:04.488]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:33:05.068 --> 02:33:11.432]  You can't weave a narrative like Greg Reese did, blaming everything on the globalists, without understanding.
[02:33:11.472 --> 02:33:14.674]  Look at corruption in Ukraine, which they also talk about.
[02:33:14.714 --> 02:33:17.076]  Putin's there to end corruption.
[02:33:17.096 --> 02:33:18.457]  Well, who started the corruption?
[02:33:18.897 --> 02:33:24.741]  You've got to remember, these are all former Soviet states where all the bureaucrats within the country were taking bribes.
[02:33:25.501 --> 02:33:27.863]  Corruption was endemic in all of the countries.
[02:33:28.570 --> 02:33:32.752]  They had phony right-wing leaders even to take over these countries.
[02:33:32.792 --> 02:33:39.336]  Look at Lech Walesa in Poland, supposedly in charge of the anti-Soviet Solidarity Union.
[02:33:39.376 --> 02:33:40.957]  He ended up being a Soviet agent.
[02:33:41.217 --> 02:33:46.380]  So was Lech Walesa of Czechoslovakia, this so-called Western, pro-Western poet.
[02:33:47.861 --> 02:33:52.784]  Zelensky is the only one that has not been a pro-Russian puppet.
[02:33:53.224 --> 02:33:56.726]  Timoshenko was pro-Russian puppet, and so was Poroshenko.
[02:33:57.692 --> 02:34:01.195]  So you see, the Russians were doing that, not the globalists.
[02:34:02.135 --> 02:34:11.763]  The Russians, you know, took advantage of the corruption, and all the energy factors, even Timoshenko got millions of dollars through the energy thing.
[02:34:11.823 --> 02:34:16.126]  Well, if she were truly anti-Russian, she wouldn't have been able to get any of those money.
[02:34:16.866 --> 02:34:35.644]   It's really interesting that in the anti-Selensky stuff that's come out recently in the press, in the right-wing press, They're quoting an opposition party saying they have evidence that Zelensky has transferred billions of dollars through various oligarchs to a Miami bank account and bought certain jewelry and other things and laundered the money, this and that.
[02:34:36.485 --> 02:34:40.268]  And you know, I responded to this and said, look, this is too good to be true evidence.
[02:34:41.469 --> 02:34:48.855]  No private party, no political party has the ability to trace those kinds of transactions.
[02:34:49.075 --> 02:34:50.296]  Only governments do.
[02:34:50.977 --> 02:34:52.818]  This is an intelligence operation.
[02:34:53.789 --> 02:34:59.971]  I mean, just to be able to trace laundering of money through various oligarchs to get it to Zelensky.
[02:35:00.671 --> 02:35:04.152]  And look, none of us can disprove any of this because we don't have access.
[02:35:04.572 --> 02:35:06.453]  We can't trace these back.
[02:35:06.493 --> 02:35:07.293]  We can't check it.
[02:35:07.313 --> 02:35:10.734]  And they don't provide any of the banking records for us to check.
[02:35:11.255 --> 02:35:20.077]  This is either made up of whole cloth or they simply tracked oligarch transfer of money and said, it's going to Zelensky.
[02:35:20.137 --> 02:35:22.318]  But I don't see the proof there.
[02:35:22.765 --> 02:35:25.908]  And so far, Zelensky is not showing that he's a puppet.
[02:35:26.348 --> 02:35:29.951]  He's really trying to resist the Russian forces and not giving in easily.
[02:35:31.992 --> 02:35:33.353]  So why did Putin wait so long?
[02:35:33.373 --> 02:35:35.695]  The eight years?
[02:35:39.358 --> 02:35:44.202]  You know, it's hard when you're dealing with multiple conspiracies to know exactly what's in their mind.
[02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:52.724]  I can tell you that most of the people that go along with the globalists in the United States are not knowing conspiracy.
[02:35:52.744 --> 02:35:56.726]  They don't know the globalists are going to lead us into World War III, a very destructive war.
[02:35:56.946 --> 02:35:58.007]  They don't know the end game.
[02:35:58.527 --> 02:36:02.229]  They just know that they're going along to get along because they're rewarded.
[02:36:02.249 --> 02:36:04.810]  They're not, they're not criticized by the press.
[02:36:05.230 --> 02:36:06.711]  They continue to get reelected.
[02:36:07.131 --> 02:36:08.132]  They take money.
[02:36:08.192 --> 02:36:12.434]  They are allowed to invest in the stock market and get wealthy as most congressmen do.
[02:36:13.476 --> 02:36:20.683]  So this issue of conspiracy is very complex in terms of who really knows what's going on at the top levels.
[02:36:21.123 --> 02:36:36.164]   Well, Putin obviously knows, but it used to be when Yeltsin took over the Soviet Union that the original oligarchs who were controlling the Politburo, who brought Brezhnev to power, We're behind the scenes.
[02:36:36.384 --> 02:36:43.748]  People like Boris Berezovsky, who became head of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Gusinsky, and Khodorkovsky, of the oil magnate.
[02:36:44.348 --> 02:36:48.731]  These were the original communist leaders behind the scenes that were behind Brezhnev.
[02:36:49.551 --> 02:37:00.518]  And after the phony fall of the Soviet Union, they came forward and instructed the State Bank of Russia to lend them the money to buy up the oil industry, to buy up the media industry.
[02:37:00.558 --> 02:37:02.299]  So that's how they became oligarchs.
[02:37:03.319 --> 02:37:04.220]  We're going to come right back.
[02:37:05.441 --> 02:37:10.064]  We're going to come right back more with Joel Skousen, editor at World Affairs Brief.
[02:37:10.124 --> 02:37:11.465]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host.
[02:37:11.505 --> 02:37:12.546]  Good to be with you today.
[02:37:12.866 --> 02:37:13.707]  But we'll be right back.
[02:37:13.747 --> 02:37:14.728]  We have a lot to talk about.
[02:37:14.828 --> 02:37:16.549]  What was the endgame of all of this?
[02:37:16.849 --> 02:37:22.093]  And if they're all coming from that side, I'm Kate Daly, your guest host from the Kate Daly Show.
[02:37:22.153 --> 02:37:23.213]  Nice to be with you today.
[02:37:23.273 --> 02:37:28.217]  My guest is Joel Skousen from, of course, worldaffairsbrief.com.
[02:37:28.237 --> 02:37:29.438]  He is the editor of that.
[02:37:30.078 --> 02:37:31.319]  And I welcome him back.
[02:37:31.399 --> 02:37:39.145]  I'm always open to points of view, to different ways to discuss this matter, because obviously something has taken place there.
[02:37:39.285 --> 02:37:42.787]  It started a long time ago, but the last eight years have been pretty eventful.
[02:37:43.528 --> 02:37:46.050]  And so what were the last eight years?
[02:37:46.110 --> 02:37:50.493]  What was the object of this last eight years, do you think, for Russia and for us?
[02:37:51.033 --> 02:37:58.515]  I'm going back to Obama's statement again when he said we had brokered a deal to transition power in Ukraine.
[02:37:58.935 --> 02:38:03.117]  And so what was the outcome of this in your mind, Joel?
[02:38:03.197 --> 02:38:08.338]  What was the benefit or what was the drawback of this last eight years in Ukraine?
[02:38:09.598 --> 02:38:14.900]  Well, you've got to remember that Putin is playing the long game, as I was talking to you before the break.
[02:38:16.343 --> 02:38:23.565]  The original oligarchs came out of Russia and began to become wealthy and rule Russia with the puppet Yeltsin.
[02:38:24.766 --> 02:38:31.588]  He was incompetent, so they brought a KGB colonel, ruthless, not Christian, atheist, to the forefront to run.
[02:38:32.128 --> 02:38:34.468]  He eventually overthrew the original oligarchs.
[02:38:35.009 --> 02:38:37.609]  Berezovsky he had killed and assassinated in London.
[02:38:38.110 --> 02:38:43.071]  He exiled Guzemsky in jail, Khodorkovsky and the various others had a demise.
[02:38:43.692 --> 02:38:52.595]  So now we have a transition to the behind the scene communist running the power to a strong man like Stalin, Lenin, or Khrushchev.
[02:38:52.996 --> 02:38:54.196]  That's what Putin is now.
[02:38:54.516 --> 02:38:56.797]  And he is really running things ruthlessly.
[02:38:57.337 --> 02:39:00.839]  The party is still very active behind the scenes running the bureaucracy.
[02:39:00.919 --> 02:39:04.860]  And you hear still in the Kremlin, people talking about the party says this, the party says that.
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:07.201]  And they're not talking about Putin's United Party.
[02:39:07.241 --> 02:39:10.122]  They're talking about the Communist Party, which still rules.
[02:39:10.222 --> 02:39:28.541]   So what's happening is that The goal of faking their own demise was to get Western aid and trade and technology so that they could rebuild their military structure and gain back the loss that they had during the Reagan administration where they were getting very much behind.
[02:39:29.282 --> 02:39:39.311]  So one of the reasons for waiting eight years to take back Ukraine is that remember when you're going to go up against the West or potentially you've got to be ready militarily.
[02:39:39.997 --> 02:39:45.378]  And so he had to wait this particular time until he's really rebuilt the military, which he clearly has.
[02:39:45.979 --> 02:39:48.899]  I mean, they are far superior in military throw weight.
[02:39:49.039 --> 02:39:53.581]  Our missiles, our 400 minute men and missiles have only one warhead on them now.
[02:39:54.141 --> 02:39:57.522]  They've taken the three off and put one on, just part of the December.
[02:39:57.582 --> 02:40:03.283]  And he's got, you know, the new Sarmat missile with 15 maneuvering warheads on it.
[02:40:03.643 --> 02:40:09.105]  Massive missiles, mobile in an underground bunkers that cannot be touched by our submarines.
[02:40:10.688 --> 02:40:12.148]  He's got hypersonic missiles.
[02:40:12.749 --> 02:40:19.273]  He's got massive artillery forces in his conventional armies, which he hasn't hardly used yet in this.
[02:40:20.054 --> 02:40:24.436]  So he's playing a very sophisticated long game of reconstituting the Soviet Union.
[02:40:24.556 --> 02:40:28.419]  Notice when he started this, he said, excuse, I need a buffer zone between NATO.
[02:40:28.459 --> 02:40:31.941]  I don't want US forces or missiles on my border.
[02:40:32.882 --> 02:40:34.943]  So I've got to take Ukraine as a buffer zone.
[02:40:35.888 --> 02:40:42.831]  Well, look, he's already got three NATO countries, the Baltics on his border with missiles.
[02:40:43.032 --> 02:40:46.313]  Well, they don't have missiles, but you know, we potentially could have.
[02:40:46.353 --> 02:40:48.654]  So that excuse is really a lame excuse.
[02:40:49.475 --> 02:40:53.637]  It's very clear that the globalists are not going to stop Putin in this.
[02:40:53.717 --> 02:40:55.098]  They're going to let him have his way.
[02:40:55.858 --> 02:40:58.339]  It doesn't matter what kind of arms you throw at it.
[02:40:58.419 --> 02:40:59.560]  It's going to slow down.
[02:40:59.680 --> 02:41:01.421]  It's going to make Russia pay a price.
[02:41:01.481 --> 02:41:03.882]  It's going to allow Russia to be rightly demonized.
[02:41:04.505 --> 02:41:04.965]  In the West.
[02:41:05.085 --> 02:41:14.092]  And I've always said in the World Affairs Brief, the globalist in the media will protect Russia and China until World War Three gets very, very close.
[02:41:14.232 --> 02:41:17.515]  And then they'll start to demonize when it's too late to stop it.
[02:41:18.476 --> 02:41:21.598]  And this is one of the reasons why they're letting this go forward.
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:36.907]  It's true that, you know, Ukraine is shipping some old line fighters, Russian fighters from the former Soviet states back to Ukraine, though it's very problematic because all the airfields have been busted up.
[02:41:36.967 --> 02:41:37.987]  Where are they going to land?
[02:41:38.007 --> 02:41:38.648]  I don't know.
[02:41:39.228 --> 02:41:47.232]  They're shipping more Javelin missiles and things, but these are just band-aids without US intervention or a no fly zone, for example.
[02:41:48.311 --> 02:41:49.092]  You know, the U.S.
[02:41:49.192 --> 02:41:51.194]  put a no-fly zone over Croatia.
[02:41:51.214 --> 02:41:52.976]  They put a no-fly zone over Iraq.
[02:41:53.016 --> 02:41:54.698]  They put a no-fly zone over Libya.
[02:41:54.718 --> 02:41:55.779]  These are not our countries.
[02:41:55.799 --> 02:41:57.020]  They have nothing to do with U.S.
[02:41:57.120 --> 02:41:57.500]  interests.
[02:41:59.022 --> 02:42:00.544]  So Ukraine has no U.S.
[02:42:00.604 --> 02:42:03.286]  interests, but why do we put a no-fly zone over there?
[02:42:03.887 --> 02:42:10.594]  Because if you get rid of Russian superiority and air power, then you give a chance for the Ukrainian army to survive.
[02:42:11.286 --> 02:42:12.086]  We could do that.
[02:42:12.386 --> 02:42:18.669]  In fact, it would put us head to head with Russian aircraft, and it's not ready for World War Three yet.
[02:42:18.709 --> 02:42:20.870]  That's one of the reasons why the globalists aren't doing this.
[02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:33.655]  But we could actually, with our F-35s, do a lot of damage to the Russian Air Force, because nothing competes with the F-35's ability to target targets, multiple targets, out at 200 miles.
[02:42:34.055 --> 02:42:35.136]  The Russians can't do that.
[02:42:36.769 --> 02:42:38.730]  And so it would be very effective.
[02:42:38.770 --> 02:42:41.191]  And I think the Russians would back down if we would do that.
[02:42:41.631 --> 02:42:47.774]  So Biden's State of the Union address and Germany's Chancellor saying, we will not tolerate this.
[02:42:47.894 --> 02:42:50.876]  We will not tolerate, you know, just so much hot air.
[02:42:51.316 --> 02:42:53.337]  They are going to tolerate it and let it happen.
[02:42:53.858 --> 02:43:01.842]  It does serve the globalist purpose of eventually, you know, demonizing Russia, which I think is a problem, which they've been protecting for so long.
[02:43:03.402 --> 02:43:05.783]  And alerting the American people that Russia really is an enemy.
[02:43:05.923 --> 02:43:15.125]  Unfortunately, Mitt Romney, our traitorous senator from Utah, is making hay about this, saying, I was right all the time about Russia being a lethal threat.
[02:43:15.205 --> 02:43:17.866]  Well, China is also a lethal threat.
[02:43:18.846 --> 02:43:20.167]  He's not criticizing China.
[02:43:21.427 --> 02:43:21.627]  Yeah.
[02:43:21.847 --> 02:43:23.848]  What about the move with Swift Banking?
[02:43:24.048 --> 02:43:24.908]  What's your take on that?
[02:43:26.508 --> 02:43:29.269]  Well, it's only a partial move.
[02:43:29.329 --> 02:43:32.030]  It's not a total cutoff of Swift of Russia.
[02:43:32.645 --> 02:43:34.767]  You have to watch these sanctions, for example.
[02:43:35.147 --> 02:43:41.392]  The so-called sanction against the Nord Stream pipeline was only stopping the certification at the end of the line.
[02:43:41.412 --> 02:43:42.773]  It's not stopping construction.
[02:43:43.174 --> 02:43:46.977]  They're going to continue to construct the pipeline while the sanction is in place.
[02:43:47.357 --> 02:43:55.544]  But the SWIFT banking thing has caused, let me put it this way, banks outside can still use SWIFT to talk to Russia.
[02:43:55.584 --> 02:44:02.129]  They've just cut off Russia's ability to talk through SWIFT to clear things through the SWIFT system with other banks.
[02:44:02.808 --> 02:44:05.109]  And it's had a dramatic effect in Russia.
[02:44:05.170 --> 02:44:06.831]  The banks are having runs on them.
[02:44:06.891 --> 02:44:10.092]  The ruble is down to about a 105 U.S.
[02:44:10.713 --> 02:44:14.115]  dollars, meaning it's worth about a penny for every U.S.
[02:44:14.175 --> 02:44:17.277]  dollar and down about 25 percent.
[02:44:18.117 --> 02:44:19.758]  So it really is hurting.
[02:44:19.878 --> 02:44:25.922]  And they are now starting, under great criticism, to sanction the Russian oil system.
[02:44:26.242 --> 02:44:27.223]  You know, the U.S.
[02:44:27.243 --> 02:44:28.904]  stupidly imports Russian oil.
[02:44:30.637 --> 02:44:32.978]  And Biden is being pressured to stop that.
[02:44:33.018 --> 02:44:33.899]  He's resisting.
[02:44:33.919 --> 02:44:35.900]  He says that'll drive up gas prices.
[02:44:35.940 --> 02:44:39.402]  Well, this whole affair is driving up gas prices.
[02:44:39.422 --> 02:44:44.905]  You're stopping fracking, you know, is the one that mostly drove up gas prices.
[02:44:46.106 --> 02:44:53.381]   I was just appalled at the State of the Union marriage message, you know, promising to Stop the border influx.
[02:44:53.401 --> 02:44:54.541]  I mean, who believes that?
[02:44:54.701 --> 02:44:56.802]  You know, promising to defend Ukraine.
[02:44:57.522 --> 02:45:04.165]  And to say inflation is only temporary and that you can just simply cut costs and start to build in the United States instead of overseas.
[02:45:04.645 --> 02:45:05.766]  Well, that doesn't cut costs.
[02:45:05.846 --> 02:45:08.027]  It's much more expensive to build in the United States.
[02:45:08.647 --> 02:45:14.049]  I mean, this is just an irrational show of stupidity to the American people.
[02:45:15.686 --> 02:45:20.691]  Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know that anyone was expecting anything else last night.
[02:45:20.771 --> 02:45:27.879]  Of course, he's not going to say anything that isn't a complete lie to the American people.
[02:45:27.979 --> 02:45:37.805]   And chalking it up as the most important speech since the 90s, that was another You know, a chalk mark for being a buffoon.
[02:45:37.846 --> 02:45:43.147]  I mean, the guy's a buffoon, we all know it, and I didn't expect anything from what I heard last night.
[02:45:43.727 --> 02:45:45.308]  But I appreciate you weighing in on this.
[02:45:45.448 --> 02:45:55.991]  I think you have a different take than a lot of people on this, and I am all for listening to all kinds of different takes, because I always want to know what the outcome is, and so I appreciate you coming on with me.
[02:45:57.111 --> 02:46:00.793]  But I think there's so many things at hand here, is there not?
[02:46:02.513 --> 02:46:06.078]  So many things the American people don't understand about all these relationships.
[02:46:07.579 --> 02:46:09.241]  And it's very complex, Kate.
[02:46:09.301 --> 02:46:13.046]  Look, I've been studying conspiracy and deep state for years.
[02:46:13.126 --> 02:46:14.047]  I'm an expert on it.
[02:46:14.898 --> 02:46:22.402]  And it would take me an hour just to go through the complexity of taking apart this Greg Reese video and showing how this is true, but this is not.
[02:46:22.442 --> 02:46:24.083]  And this implies this, but that's wrong.
[02:46:24.143 --> 02:46:26.944]  And this, I mean, it's very, very complex what's going on.
[02:46:26.984 --> 02:46:32.267]  And I don't expect the American people to get that, but that's one of the reasons why I put out the World Affairs Brief every week.
[02:46:32.988 --> 02:46:37.090]  And I'm going to give a detailed explanation of this disinformation campaign.
[02:46:37.810 --> 02:46:40.391]  Not that these people are evil.
[02:46:40.572 --> 02:46:43.273]  I'm not trying to cast aspersions, but.
[02:46:44.351 --> 02:46:53.394]  If people want to get a free sample of this Friday's brief, they can go to worldaffairsbrief.com and click on Request a Sample on Friday and they'll get that brief.
[02:46:54.534 --> 02:46:55.034]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:46:55.074 --> 02:46:56.054]  I'll be right back.
[02:46:56.635 --> 02:46:57.175]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:46:58.115 --> 02:47:00.036]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host, back with you.
[02:47:00.176 --> 02:47:02.376]  So glad you're joining me, too, and so glad to be here.
[02:47:02.456 --> 02:47:03.136]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:47:03.477 --> 02:47:09.258]  And there's a couple of things I want to mention, and I really appreciate Joel Skousen coming on.
[02:47:09.418 --> 02:47:11.239]  I've been talking with Joel Skousen for years.
[02:47:12.898 --> 02:47:22.441]  I can't forget that Obama said to CNN that he had brokered a deal to transition power in Ukraine specifically.
[02:47:22.461 --> 02:47:33.964]  I can't forget Newland's leaked phone call where she said the words that she said, you know, F the EU and we're going in and we're helping financially.
[02:47:34.761 --> 02:47:41.203]  That to me says that we're very much behind that coup in 2014, and we had a vested interest in Ukraine.
[02:47:41.783 --> 02:47:42.723]  And I'll tell you why.
[02:47:42.983 --> 02:47:46.364]  But we also, with the loans, were obviously doing things.
[02:47:47.064 --> 02:47:53.006]  Even John Kerry, at the time US Secretary of State, announced that Washington was preparing $1 billion in loans.
[02:47:54.486 --> 02:48:02.012]  For the coup-imposed government of Ukraine, you know, he didn't say coup, but this is how it was categorized, of course.
[02:48:02.412 --> 02:48:16.804]  And then we had, remember the report of Obama's guy hiring 800 Blackwater mercenaries deployed on the ground in Ukraine, and then also another billion dollars sent over, and then of course five billion more dollars.
[02:48:17.481 --> 02:48:35.886]  So there's been a lot of money and there's been a lot of corporations and a lot of our, I can't call them leaders because I don't have that much respect for them, but the Romneys, the Pelosi's, the Kerry's, the Biden's, all having children work in corporations there, setting up corporations and so forth.
[02:48:36.446 --> 02:48:39.747]  And of course, Ukraine being the biggest donor to the Clinton Foundation.
[02:48:39.907 --> 02:48:42.408]  That's something that you need to keep in mind as well.
[02:48:43.493 --> 02:48:50.278]  Also, on that same note, we have probably about $5 billion to $7.5 billion also reported going into Ukraine.
[02:48:54.315 --> 02:49:03.739]  So, when you take in all this information and you're looking at it as a whole, there's a lot of things that we have been doing and there's a vested interest that we have in Ukraine.
[02:49:04.039 --> 02:49:04.759]  Can't forget that.
[02:49:05.220 --> 02:49:15.764]  And I'm really looking at all points of view because I feel like I never want to be somebody that's made up my mind completely and only agree with myself and only agree with what I've come up with.
[02:49:15.884 --> 02:49:35.110]   And this is why I listen to Joel, I listen to Tom Mullen, I listen to a lot of different people explain the situation And then I'm looking on the ground and saying, why if you're putting in your Russian puppets in Ukraine, is it only to acquire this money to give up Ukraine and take Ukraine back after eight years?
[02:49:35.350 --> 02:49:49.693]  Then I'm reading accounts of people on the ground saying how the Ukrainian leadership was going after and helping to murder, rape, kill the Russians in Donbass.
[02:49:50.933 --> 02:49:52.515]  There's a lot of different stories.
[02:49:52.975 --> 02:50:03.648]  And then on top of all of that, you have the DoD Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DTRA, funding 11 laboratories.
[02:50:04.815 --> 02:50:05.075]  Right?
[02:50:05.675 --> 02:50:19.339]  Eleven laboratories in which they're doing, you could consider it bioweapon now just because of the fact that we have been dealing with gain of function and all of course turning diseases into bioweapons.
[02:50:19.839 --> 02:50:26.020]  And so this was the criticism of Russia going into the border was that we actually had all of these labs.
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:28.041]  We had put a lot of money into these labs.
[02:50:28.521 --> 02:50:33.682]  So there are some big things going on with that specifically that I think play a huge part in this.
[02:50:34.151 --> 02:50:34.857]  In fact, um...
[02:50:36.704 --> 02:50:45.068]  Ukraine has no control over the military biolaboratories on its own territory and according to the 2005 agreement with the U.S.
[02:50:45.128 --> 02:50:57.133]  DoD and Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government is prohibited from public disclosure of all the sensitive information about us and Ukraine, is obliged to transfer to the U.S.
[02:50:57.173 --> 02:51:00.815]  Department of Defense dangerous pathogens for biological research.
[02:51:01.275 --> 02:51:08.079]   Now the fact checkers got on this and said, oh nothing to see here folks, don't worry about It's a few animals, no big deal.
[02:51:08.339 --> 02:51:09.960]  Yeah, I don't believe that for a hot second.
[02:51:10.601 --> 02:51:17.085]  The Pentagon has been granted access to certain state secrets of Ukraine in connection with the projects under their agreement.
[02:51:17.466 --> 02:51:20.308]  Biowarfare scientists under diplomatic cover.
[02:51:20.988 --> 02:51:23.810]  We have among the set of bilateral agreements with the U.S.
[02:51:23.870 --> 02:51:28.254]  and Ukraine is the establishment of the Science and Technology Center in Ukraine.
[02:51:28.654 --> 02:51:30.475]  A lot of money being funneled through there.
[02:51:31.896 --> 02:51:39.060]  And an international, they are an international organization funded mainly by us, all right, which has accorded diplomatic status.
[02:51:40.121 --> 02:51:56.529]  We also know that some things have been sort of leaked out as far as bioweapon, if you want to call it that, in disease and Ukrainians, we've had Ukrainians dying from swine flu, we've had Ukrainians dying from all kinds of things that they've been working on possibly in these labs.
[02:51:56.930 --> 02:51:59.711]  So of course, these labs do pose a threat.
[02:51:59.731 --> 02:52:01.052]  You can't ignore that.
[02:52:02.219 --> 02:52:06.203]  We also, um, I mean, everything from cholera to you name it.
[02:52:06.223 --> 02:52:08.985]  I mean, they were working on some serious things in these labs.
[02:52:09.045 --> 02:52:14.350]  So the fact checkers, you know, whatever that means, to liberals in a basement, whatever.
[02:52:14.831 --> 02:52:17.994]  All I know is that these bio labs do pose a threat.
[02:52:18.717 --> 02:52:32.507]  Then also, you're looking at a situation where we have minerals in the ground and we have Ukraine as one of the number one producers of a gas that goes into the chips.
[02:52:32.547 --> 02:52:39.953]  You know, the reason that you are having a hard time buying a truck, the reason you're having a hard time buying a lot of things that present with chips.
[02:52:40.473 --> 02:52:42.237]  And so this market is huge.
[02:52:42.518 --> 02:52:47.008]  We also know that the Ukraine was to invest more than $333 million in its uranium mining industry over five years.
[02:52:51.581 --> 02:52:58.526]  When that announcement took place, right, that was according to the concept of the development of nuclear energy industry.
[02:52:58.586 --> 02:53:02.469]  It was prepared by the Ministry of Energy of Ukraine.
[02:53:02.869 --> 02:53:10.956]  Ukraine intends to fully cover requirements of its nuclear power plants and produce uranium from 2027.
[02:53:11.736 --> 02:53:19.382]  They were going to be doing that domestically and Kiev is planning to reach this target by developing the reserves of uranium deposits.
[02:53:19.862 --> 02:53:34.896]  And so, for these purposes, they're planning to allocate investments in the amount of $9 billion, you know, in their economy, which is about $333 million in ours over the next five years.
[02:53:35.877 --> 02:53:38.079]  Does that have a lot to do with what is going on?
[02:53:39.312 --> 02:54:04.512]  In the big picture, when you're really looking at this whole situation, and you start to see how our utilities push the White House not to sanction Russian uranium, how the conflicts of minerals fund a war, how Afghanistan's vast reserves of mineral and natural gas can be at stake, pipelines, utilities, everything.
[02:54:05.352 --> 02:54:08.495]  Is it much more than we know, than we think?
[02:54:09.722 --> 02:54:19.288]  And, if the Ukrainians were cheering on the deaths of innocent Russians, men, women, and children in Donbass, wouldn't we have a problem with that?
[02:54:19.649 --> 02:54:22.571]  Why are we only getting out the signs now?
[02:54:22.851 --> 02:54:36.660]  Every time the media tells us who to hate and who to love, what to see, what not to see, what your eyes are telling you, what your eyes are not telling you, every time the government seeks to do this, I usually go the other way, because then you know you can find some truth.
[02:54:37.290 --> 02:54:47.642]  So if the government is making Zelensky a hero, I just watched the music video in which he's wearing S&M, black leather, high heels with four other guys, singing the Sultry Songs.
[02:54:48.463 --> 02:54:48.843]  Yeah.
[02:54:49.284 --> 02:54:49.584]  Uh-huh.
[02:54:50.233 --> 02:54:50.673]  Good guy.
[02:54:50.994 --> 02:55:00.501]  Anyway, um, and so, uh, the pictures of him in the military garb, those were taken, those were taken, uh, back in April, April 9th of 2021.
[02:55:01.082 --> 02:55:06.526]  But they're being, um, they're being flown around the internet as if he's standing there and fighting for his country.
[02:55:06.586 --> 02:55:07.367]  I don't believe it.
[02:55:08.047 --> 02:55:11.990]  Just like the tank, when you see the tank roll over the car, who's in the tank?
[02:55:12.451 --> 02:55:14.092]  Who was positioned to take that video?
[02:55:14.801 --> 02:55:15.061]  Right?
[02:55:15.141 --> 02:55:15.982]  Right at the right time.
[02:55:16.422 --> 02:55:21.805]  Why is one single car on the highway and why is it waiting to leave until the tank arrives anyway?
[02:55:22.285 --> 02:55:27.888]  There are too many questions because we have been shown footage before that was a complete lie.
[02:55:28.148 --> 02:55:34.512]  The little boy on the shore that was dead sparked everybody's emotions to go in and invade Syria.
[02:55:35.172 --> 02:55:37.994]  Then we've come to find out that the little boy is alive.
[02:55:39.255 --> 02:55:46.857]  The guys taking the pictures as supposedly dead soldiers getting up with death makeup on, getting up after taking those photos.
[02:55:47.217 --> 02:55:48.738]  Do you believe anything you see?
[02:55:48.758 --> 02:55:50.118]  I don't.
[02:55:51.279 --> 02:55:53.539]  In fact, I don't believe any of it.
[02:55:53.559 --> 02:56:01.862]  In fact, I want to look at what's underground, what's in this big stake for them, what does Russia get out of this, and what don't they get out of this.
[02:56:03.134 --> 02:56:04.896]  Can you trust Putin to tell the truth?
[02:56:05.517 --> 02:56:08.460]  Well, has he been empire building for 50 years?
[02:56:09.121 --> 02:56:12.885]  I don't see the empire building take place, but I see us empire building.
[02:56:13.907 --> 02:56:17.050]  I have a whole list of countries that we have done that to.
[02:56:17.871 --> 02:56:18.892]  Lied about the leaders.
[02:56:19.033 --> 02:56:33.333]   And whenever we see a demonization, This, in so much of a frenzy that people are, you know, he's the equivalent of Satan himself, then I wonder, wait a minute here, something is very, very wrong with this picture.
[02:56:34.881 --> 02:56:41.086]  And since I have been studying the deep state, I will say that, of course, did COVID do enough?
[02:56:41.346 --> 02:56:45.769]  Will this meet some goals into the Great Reset?
[02:56:46.169 --> 02:56:46.950]  Absolutely.
[02:56:47.510 --> 02:56:48.331]  Absolutely.
[02:56:48.731 --> 02:56:50.632]  Is this a war between pandemics?
[02:56:50.732 --> 02:56:52.013]  Is the other shoe going to drop?
[02:56:52.734 --> 02:56:54.215]  I don't believe there was a pandemic.
[02:56:54.255 --> 02:56:55.936]  That would mean people were dying around you.
[02:56:55.996 --> 02:56:57.177]  People weren't dying around you.
[02:56:57.197 --> 02:56:58.478]  They were only dying in ICUs.
[02:56:58.958 --> 02:57:02.220]  But will the next one that drops be more dangerous?
[02:57:02.881 --> 02:57:04.322]  These are the questions I'm asking.
[02:57:05.037 --> 02:57:08.140]  And I'm asking, you know, Rush's role in all of this.
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:12.003]  For some reason, I don't get that he's trying to take us over.
[02:57:12.023 --> 02:57:13.505]  I just don't.
[02:57:14.125 --> 02:57:14.806]  But that's just me.
[02:57:16.427 --> 02:57:17.168]  I'm Kate Dally.
[02:57:17.268 --> 02:57:20.751]  I'm your guest host, the Kate Dally Show, katedallyradio.com.
[02:57:20.791 --> 02:57:21.352]  Come join us.
[02:57:21.392 --> 02:57:24.074]  We're live three hours a day across the nation every day.
[02:57:24.095 --> 02:57:25.196]  Really appreciate this.
[02:57:25.135 --> 02:57:48.055]  Thanks for listening to InfoWars.
[02:57:48.122 --> 02:57:49.324]  This is a great product.
[02:57:49.504 --> 02:57:52.086]  I used it when I worked as a correspondent in InfoWars.
[02:57:52.127 --> 02:57:53.588]  That's kind of when I discovered it.
[02:57:53.748 --> 02:57:59.831]   I've never been without it and the reason I like it is It doesn't give you that jumpy, ramped up feeling
[02:57:59.831 --> 02:58:03.870]   that Ephedrine does and all the products that include some form of Ephedrine.
[02:58:03.870 --> 02:58:10.030]   You can take this stuff, you can get a burst of energy to write a column or to create a video
[02:58:10.030 --> 02:58:14.150]   or to do whatever work you have to do, and then you can sleep, you're bouncing.
[02:58:13.799 --> 02:58:16.341]  Your brain doesn't bounce around like a baby in a boxcar.
[02:58:16.681 --> 02:58:19.443]  So I highly recommend Brainforce.
[02:58:19.823 --> 02:58:22.105]  I really like the new liquid formula.
[02:58:22.125 --> 02:58:26.809]  I find it superior because the absorption is immediate and it works.
[02:58:26.889 --> 02:58:27.930]  It's a subtle lift.
[02:58:28.010 --> 02:58:34.635]  You don't feel jolted, but now you felt too tired to write that email or to record that video.
[02:58:34.695 --> 02:58:37.958]  Now suddenly you've got not only the creative energy, but the physical energy.
[02:58:38.198 --> 02:58:40.300]  So I can't say enough about this product.
[02:58:40.380 --> 02:58:43.022]  And Alex, I'm not compensated to say any of this.
[02:58:43.583 --> 02:58:46.886]  So no, we don't have some secret deal where Stone will plug our products.
[02:58:47.266 --> 02:58:50.609]  No, I'm saying this because it's true and for no other reason.
[02:58:50.949 --> 02:58:52.130]  And also... I got to interrupt you.
[02:58:52.190 --> 02:58:54.412]  I have plenty of time next hour, but it's funny you raise this.
[02:58:54.832 --> 02:59:01.238]  Last time you just brought up, off air, how much you liked one of the products and the iodine.
[02:59:01.838 --> 02:59:03.780]  And then I said, well, you ought to say that on air.
[02:59:03.820 --> 02:59:04.921]  So we came back and you said it.
[02:59:05.061 --> 02:59:07.223]  They made a huge, like it was a scandal.
[02:59:07.243 --> 02:59:09.285]  You promoted the iodine product.
[02:59:09.325 --> 02:59:11.787]  They tried to say that I'm somehow selling quackery.
[02:59:11.947 --> 02:59:16.451]  Iodine is indisputably extremely value in terms of boosting natural immunity.
[02:59:16.491 --> 02:59:17.772]  There's no dispute about that.
[02:59:18.232 --> 02:59:23.934]  All I was pointing out was that the iodine product sold at InfoWars is of the highest quality.
[02:59:24.014 --> 02:59:33.938]  I mean, I've bought iodine down at, you know, the vitamin shop and I've ordered it on Amazon, as much as I hate giving Jeff Bezos a penny, but it's not of the quality that you can get at InfoWars.
[02:59:33.958 --> 02:59:35.018]   That's all That's all I was saying.
[02:59:35.118 --> 02:59:40.802]  They make it sound like this is some kind of hucksterism or that I'm somehow compensated to push these products.
[02:59:40.822 --> 02:59:41.082]  No.
[02:59:41.202 --> 02:59:50.267]  I said it because I'd just gotten over the Chinese virus and I was at the point where all I had left was this nagging cough thanks to ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.
[02:59:50.287 --> 02:59:51.408]  I had a quick recovery.
[02:59:51.508 --> 02:59:54.069]  That'll ensure that we're banned everywhere, just that I mentioned those.
[02:59:55.110 --> 02:59:57.371]  And I talked about the quality of the product.
[02:59:57.510 --> 02:59:58.510]  It's a joke.
[02:59:58.510 --> 03:00:09.510]  [Music]
[03:00:09.510 --> 03:00:17.510]   Rarely are people confronted or presented with a real 360 win or a non-zero sum game.
[03:00:17.531 --> 03:00:18.252]  But I can tell you...
[03:00:19.397 --> 03:00:25.921]  Getting high-quality, storable food from the top company in the United States that's ready to ship to you as a 360WIN.
[03:00:25.941 --> 03:00:30.865]  We are in a total inflationary environment for the next 5-10 years in my view.
[03:00:31.485 --> 03:00:34.447]  The globalists are devaluing all the major world currencies.
[03:00:34.967 --> 03:00:35.928]  Well, how do you get ahead of that?
[03:00:36.208 --> 03:00:39.270]  Well, you can buy real estate, but still you've got to pay property taxes on that.
[03:00:39.611 --> 03:00:40.511]  There's a lot of problems.
[03:00:40.571 --> 03:00:41.592]  It's not easy to offload.
[03:00:42.537 --> 03:00:49.244]  But, with things like high quality, storable food that's packaged very, very well, that lasts more than a decade, it's insurance you can eat.
[03:00:49.564 --> 03:00:55.650]  And by buying food now, you get around the inflation because, again, the food doesn't cost more in the future.
[03:00:56.451 --> 03:00:58.733]  My Patriot Supply is the biggest company in the U.S.
[03:00:59.239 --> 03:01:03.878]   after only 15 years in business because of great quality and very low prices ready to ship.

[03:01:40.708 --> 03:01:45.692]  So, take care of that box now as the world goes into this deepening Great Reset Crisis.
[03:01:46.032 --> 03:01:46.992]  Fund the Info War.
[03:01:47.113 --> 03:01:48.854]  Beat inflation all at one spot.
