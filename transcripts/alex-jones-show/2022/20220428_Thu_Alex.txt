[00:00:00.405 --> 00:00:09.987]  So, the Department of Education and the state legislatures that are controlled by Democrats have announced, we're going to sexualize your children and teach them to not be in nuclear families.
[00:00:10.207 --> 00:00:10.788]  That's official.
[00:00:11.368 --> 00:00:15.389]  The President says the children belong to the government when they're in the school, that they're the parents.
[00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:23.771]  The border's completely collapsed, but they've got school kids all over the country drilling to go to medical centers and be tested without parental consent.
[00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:25.611]  They're giving children injections without parental consent.
[00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:28.112]  Obama admits they just guinea-pigged 2 billion people.
[00:00:28.922 --> 00:00:36.625]  Putin is threatening nuclear war, and I'm just getting started, and movie stars are all over TV talking about how much they drink blood.
[00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:39.646]  Does any of this sound good to you?
[00:00:40.266 --> 00:00:45.368]  Oh, and then there's probably a hundred articles a day in major publications calling for my arrest for January 6th.
[00:00:46.048 --> 00:00:47.028]  Yeah, that's where we are, folks.
[00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:48.649]  That's where this country is.
[00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:50.330]  That's how much trouble we're all in.
[00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.290]  God help us.
[00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.710]  InfoWars.com.
[00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.711]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:00:54.427 --> 00:01:01.427]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:02.427 --> 00:01:17.427]  [Music]
[00:01:17.427 --> 00:01:22.427]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.872]  The facts and common sense are in.
[00:01:25.032 --> 00:01:26.673]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires.
[00:01:26.793 --> 00:01:27.914]  Yes, they manipulate.
[00:01:28.034 --> 00:01:29.716]  Yes, there are secret societies.
[00:01:30.076 --> 00:01:32.178]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history.
[00:01:32.478 --> 00:01:49.217]   And yes, today in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself The New World Order pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:52.925]  We're human beings are absolutely worthless.
[00:01:53.506 --> 00:02:02.455]  There's six and a quarter plus billion of us, and the globalists have said it many times, there's too many of us, we're causing a problem, we need to be cold at the tune of 80%.
[00:02:02.595 --> 00:02:18.188]   It's amazing to talk about that, but it's the globalists, the UN, their own public statements, and they've convinced a lot of Liberals and elitist conservatives and others, that by going along with this, that we're intelligent members of society.
[00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.111]  It's the ultimate Malthus worldview.
[00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:29.476]  It is this radical, virulent form of social Darwinism.
[00:02:29.596 --> 00:02:32.318]  It's the excuse of tyrants.
[00:02:33.416 --> 00:02:47.166]  And by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources, by centralizing and socializing health care, the state becomes God, basically, when it comes to your health.
[00:02:47.526 --> 00:02:54.391]  And then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us, we then basically get shoved into their system.
[00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:57.452]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:02:57.472 --> 00:02:57.873]  The U.S.
[00:02:57.893 --> 00:03:05.516]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:03:05.576 --> 00:03:09.118]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:03:09.138 --> 00:03:10.878]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:03:10.918 --> 00:03:12.859]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.200]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.521]  This is all confirmed.
[00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:17.481]  This is not a drill.
[00:03:17.661 --> 00:03:21.563]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:03:21.923 --> 00:03:23.304]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:03:23.644 --> 00:03:23.924]  Apple 100%.
[00:03:24.325 --> 00:03:29.950]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.154]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:03:35.474 --> 00:03:36.335]  This is happening.
[00:03:36.354 --> 00:03:41.113]   This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship,
[00:03:41.113 --> 00:03:44.314]   thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:03:44.314 --> 00:03:50.634]   Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:03:50.634 --> 00:03:56.394]   This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome,
[00:03:56.394 --> 00:03:59.474]  subversion paradigm manipulation.
[00:03:59.474 --> 00:04:03.274]   In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:04:03.274 --> 00:04:06.713]   We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:04:06.713 --> 00:04:12.793]   Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion
[00:04:12.793 --> 00:04:17.074]   instead of not knowing it's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:04:17.074 --> 00:04:22.274]   Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[00:04:22.274 --> 00:04:27.113]   It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States
[00:04:27.113 --> 00:04:31.834]   with traitors inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program
[00:04:31.834 --> 00:04:38.314]   and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Qaikom/Big Tech banking combine emergency situation.
[00:04:38.431 --> 00:04:43.575]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:04:44.695 --> 00:04:53.421]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:04:53.441 --> 00:04:58.344]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:04:58.705 --> 00:05:03.588]  I'm a person that cares about life and children, and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[00:05:03.968 --> 00:05:11.612]  And then they built me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:05:11.632 --> 00:05:18.835]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they'd now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[00:05:18.975 --> 00:05:24.658]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and it's being used against you.
[00:05:24.918 --> 00:05:29.480]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.641]  I have given you a transmission!
[00:05:36.503 --> 00:05:47.185]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:05:47.205 --> 00:05:48.465]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:53.046]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:58.447]  They have their AI, we have our sixth sense and beyond.
[00:05:58.287 --> 00:06:05.287]   And we'll be back on the other side with another powerful translation.
[00:06:06.287 --> 00:06:09.417]   Ladies and gentlemen, we are live, broadcasting worldwide to millions of people in defiance of tyranny and in defense
[00:06:09.417 --> 00:06:17.287]  of liberty.
[00:06:17.507 --> 00:06:18.528]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:18.548 --> 00:06:20.110]  We'll be here for the next four hours live.
[00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:24.735]  Then Owen Schroer, the Cut Destroyer, will be taking over at 3 p.m.
[00:06:24.775 --> 00:06:25.596]  Central today.
[00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:29.620]  Here from the embattled ATX Central Texas Command Center.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.843]  Now every day I come in here and have the great frustration of having hundreds of video clips, hundreds of incredible articles, and only getting to a handful of them.
[00:06:38.463 --> 00:06:41.084]  But some days I'm better than others at actually going through most of it.
[00:06:41.144 --> 00:06:42.825]  I really need to do that today.
[00:06:42.845 --> 00:06:48.727]  So we've cleared the deck of guests so that I can cover the news for the next four hours and take your phone calls.
[00:06:49.127 --> 00:06:53.789]  And we're gonna do it right now on this live Thursday, April 28th, worldwide broadcast.
[00:06:53.809 --> 00:06:55.990]  And then Paul Joseph Watson is coming up as well.
[00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.550]  Okay.
[00:06:57.931 --> 00:07:00.272]  Let me set a few headlines here so you get an idea of what we're dealing with.
[00:07:03.837 --> 00:07:07.858]  Biden, as you know, came out and said that the children belong to the state.
[00:07:09.799 --> 00:07:19.922]  And now we have Democrat legislatures and the Department of Education publicly saying that they're going to teach pleasure-based sexual relations to end the family and end relationships.
[00:07:19.962 --> 00:07:20.962]  That's always been the plan.
[00:07:21.222 --> 00:07:29.445]  Whether it's homosexual or heterosexual, it is being pushed so that you don't form meaningful long-term relationships, so you're isolated.
[00:07:30.605 --> 00:07:32.306]  And that is why they're doing all of this.
[00:07:33.342 --> 00:07:46.874]  This is the Democratic Party and the federal government literally conquering America biologically with the destruction of the normal mammalian activity and the hyper-sexualization of children at young ages so they can wreck their trajectory of their lives.
[00:07:49.296 --> 00:07:49.776]  Unbelievable.
[00:07:49.816 --> 00:07:51.198]  That's just two of the articles.
[00:07:53.271 --> 00:07:56.233]  Here's another one, and I'm not going through these in the order of what's most important.
[00:07:56.413 --> 00:07:57.153]  They're all important.
[00:07:57.173 --> 00:07:59.715]  It all just shows the evil cup that's been spilt out on us.
[00:08:00.576 --> 00:08:05.179]  DNC pollster finds Democrat voters frustrated, discouraged, and frightened.
[00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:07.180]  Frightened of their own party.
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:08.080]  Yes, frightened.
[00:08:08.741 --> 00:08:10.042]  Taught to hate the Republicans.
[00:08:10.842 --> 00:08:11.843]  Taught to hate Christians.
[00:08:12.103 --> 00:08:13.724]  Taught to hate conservatives and populists.
[00:08:14.304 --> 00:08:16.486]  And there's certainly some people that aren't perfect that are Republicans.
[00:08:18.018 --> 00:08:27.061]  But knowing, you can see for yourself, America is literally being destroyed as fast as the globalists can without getting an uprising.
[00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:31.942]  And they have another plan to actually push it and get an uprising.
[00:08:32.002 --> 00:08:34.383]  So we are stuck in a rock and a hard place.
[00:08:34.423 --> 00:08:35.423]  We don't want uprisings.
[00:08:37.023 --> 00:08:38.184]  And we don't want to collapse.
[00:08:38.264 --> 00:08:42.945]  We have to just politically, culturally, spiritually take back control of our lives and not comply.
[00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:45.922]  We've got that incredible information.
[00:08:45.962 --> 00:08:49.664]  We have all these different Hollywood people talking about how they drink blood on television.
[00:08:50.184 --> 00:08:51.124]  Not just Megan Fox.
[00:08:51.164 --> 00:08:52.845]  I thought I'd get to what's behind that.
[00:08:52.885 --> 00:08:54.186]  That's called lesser magic.
[00:08:55.746 --> 00:08:57.007]  They need to tell you what they're doing.
[00:08:57.047 --> 00:08:58.028]  That gives it more power.
[00:08:59.108 --> 00:09:00.749]  The Native Americans called it counting coup.
[00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:09.955]  Not when they drank blood, but when they would tell somebody they were coming to kill them, you get extra feather in your hat and your cap if you told somebody you were coming.
[00:09:10.435 --> 00:09:19.481]  And then if you counted coup, where you would have a club that wasn't a lethal club, but a wooden club where you'd hit him in the leg, hit him in the chest, hit him in the head, and your coup would just go up.
[00:09:19.661 --> 00:09:27.906]  But you were so good, you could have killed them three, four times before you pull out the real battle axe, the real stone club, and beat their brains out.
[00:09:28.933 --> 00:09:30.434]  It's all part of counting coup.
[00:09:30.454 --> 00:09:32.135]  It's like a video game.
[00:09:32.195 --> 00:09:38.919]  You get jumbo spiritual numbers with Diablo when you drink the blood on TV.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.721]  So we've got that coming up.
[00:09:41.921 --> 00:09:50.627]  It's the externalization of the hierarchy and they need to do this so that God raises the hedge of protection from us, removes it, so they can come in against us.
[00:09:50.647 --> 00:09:54.609]  This is all being done as a ritual to destroy our purity and our innocence.
[00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.611]  You see how it all ties together.
[00:09:56.631 --> 00:10:02.894]   Remember Jocelyn Elder said, And I still can't find the audio, but Rush Lumbaugh used to play it, but that was pre-internet.
[00:10:02.914 --> 00:10:04.835]  And they've scrubbed it so well.
[00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:10.477]  I couldn't find Soros saying he loved working for the Nazis from 60 Minutes, but finally found it again.
[00:10:10.497 --> 00:10:24.023]  They'd scrubbed that, but she said, no, you reach down to the baby in the crib and you do it for it, you touch it, you... And she's like, I mean, this woman was going to be the Surgeon General.
[00:10:24.043 --> 00:10:24.944]  Well, now it's official!
[00:10:26.553 --> 00:10:29.435]  Teach them the pleasure-based sexual relations at age five.
[00:10:30.416 --> 00:10:30.536]  Ugh.
[00:10:32.777 --> 00:10:37.981]  These are some really nasty folks, and they've been pushing their agenda for a long, long time.
[00:10:38.001 --> 00:10:39.282]  Let's shift gears to the other big news.
[00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:44.066]  And what do these two clips have to do with each other?
[00:10:44.146 --> 00:10:45.527]  Here, play Obama first.
[00:10:46.027 --> 00:10:49.729]  We have now essentially clinically tested the vaccine on billions worldwide.
[00:10:50.170 --> 00:10:57.254]  He just puts it out there like it's no big deal, but it is a declaration of biological and chemical war in your face, said with a smile.
[00:10:57.294 --> 00:10:57.714]  Here it is.
[00:10:58.734 --> 00:11:18.359]   Despite the fact that we've now essentially clinically tested the vaccine on billions of people worldwide, Around one in five Americans is still willing to put themselves at risk and put their families at risk rather than get vaccinated.
[00:11:21.482 --> 00:11:23.865]  People are dying because of misinformation.
[00:11:24.986 --> 00:11:30.271]  And they've set up a new disinformation Ministry of Truth officially to stop that, except everything we said was true.
[00:11:31.414 --> 00:11:32.715]  Everything they've said has been a lie.
[00:11:33.536 --> 00:11:35.357]  So let's talk about that statement.
[00:11:35.838 --> 00:11:37.299]  They said safe and effective.
[00:11:37.359 --> 00:11:40.902]  It had been tested two years ago when it wasn't tested.
[00:11:41.583 --> 00:11:48.649]  And their own internal CDC documents said it wouldn't work and would cause heart attacks, myocarditis, blood clots, cancer, infertility, you name it.
[00:11:48.669 --> 00:11:49.750]  We have it from the CDC.
[00:11:51.667 --> 00:11:55.373]  But then he works to make sure you can't hear our show where we show you all those documents.
[00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:59.260]  I showed those documents again yesterday on the screen at the CDC website.
[00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.904]  So see, the fine print tells you what it's going to do.
[00:12:03.988 --> 00:12:04.349]  But then...
[00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:12.057]  In the national news, where it's not a legally binding statement, Obama can lie to you, but hide it at the kernel of truth.
[00:12:12.938 --> 00:12:18.803]  It's now essentially been clinically tested on millions of people, and then they suppress all those real numbers as much as they can.
[00:12:19.384 --> 00:12:34.097]   Canada, the US, the EU, the UK, New Zealand, they've all announced operations to suppress clinical data because it would Add fodder or credence to the conspiracy theorists.
[00:12:34.597 --> 00:12:42.118]  Oh, a 40 plus percent increase in death in 18 to 63, stuff like that.
[00:12:42.338 --> 00:12:43.659]  That's in all the insurance numbers.
[00:12:43.699 --> 00:12:45.359]  It's 40 or 40 plus percent.
[00:12:46.019 --> 00:12:46.939]  On average, it's 40 percent.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.380]  Let that sink in, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.840]  Those are factual mainstream articles.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.640]  But then separately, oh, here's Obama.
[00:12:55.181 --> 00:12:56.221]  Oh, we tested it on you.
[00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:05.534]  As you were all guinea pigs, and then we suppress what happened and just tell you, oh, it's totally safe, and we've got to shut down anybody that disagrees with us.
[00:13:06.214 --> 00:13:06.614]  Breaking.
[00:13:06.654 --> 00:13:08.335]  Biden administration creates disinformation.
[00:13:08.395 --> 00:13:11.076]  Governance board under DHS to fight misinformation.
[00:13:11.376 --> 00:13:12.117]  We'll get into all that.
[00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:19.804]  And then meanwhile, Putin says we have weapons that no other nation has and we will use them if needed.
[00:13:19.824 --> 00:13:26.929]  And this is after Lavrov three days ago threatened basically nuclear war, saying Russia is now at war with NATO.
[00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.532]  And they're announcing that they're already sending in Polish and U.S.
[00:13:30.552 --> 00:13:32.594]  troops who are fighting.
[00:13:32.634 --> 00:13:34.435]  And I just talked to some military people this morning.
[00:13:34.995 --> 00:13:38.434]  who just returned, they said it's full on like World War II.
[00:13:38.434 --> 00:13:41.794]  Just absolute destruction, dead bodies everywhere.
[00:13:41.794 --> 00:13:45.956]   Russians annihilating, Russians getting annihilated, just tank battles,
[00:13:45.956 --> 00:13:48.835]  this is full on war, folks.
[00:13:48.835 --> 00:13:52.755]   That's why you're not seeing a lot of it or hearing about it, it is just full on war.
[00:13:52.755 --> 00:13:55.635]  We're at war with Russia right now. Here's Putin.
[00:13:55.635 --> 00:13:58.674]  Very interesting study.
[00:13:58.674 --> 00:14:06.915]   If anyone attempts to interfere in these events from the outside, they must know.
[00:14:07.141 --> 00:14:20.749]  And if they create threats, strategic threats to Russia that are unacceptable to us, they must realize that our response to their attacks will be swift.
[00:14:24.111 --> 00:14:29.454]  We will, we have all the instruments, all the weapons required to do so.
[00:14:30.255 --> 00:14:41.559]   We have Weapons that no other nation has, and we will use them if needed.
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:53.368]  So, the Department of Education and the state legislatures that are controlled by Democrats have announced, we're going to sexualize your children and teach them to not be in nuclear families.
[00:14:53.608 --> 00:14:54.188]  That's official.
[00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:58.772]  The president says the children belong to the government when they're in the school, that they're the parents.
[00:15:00.134 --> 00:15:07.157]  The border's completely collapsed, but they've got school kids all over the country drilling to go to medical centers and be tested without parental consent.
[00:15:07.177 --> 00:15:08.998]  They're giving children injections without parental consent.
[00:15:09.378 --> 00:15:11.539]  Obama admits they just guinea-pigged 2 billion people.
[00:15:12.319 --> 00:15:13.799]  Putin is threatening nuclear war.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.161]  And I'm just getting started.
[00:15:17.581 --> 00:15:19.962]  And movie stars are all over TV talking about how much they drink blood.
[00:15:21.459 --> 00:15:23.020]  Does any of this sound good to you?
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.742]  Oh, and then there's probably a hundred articles today in major publications calling for my arrest for January 6th.
[00:15:29.422 --> 00:15:30.403]  Yeah, that's where we are, folks.
[00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:32.024]  That's where this country is.
[00:15:32.064 --> 00:15:33.704]  That's how much trouble we're all in.
[00:15:34.105 --> 00:15:34.665]  God help us.
[00:15:35.085 --> 00:15:36.085]  Infowars.com.
[00:15:36.285 --> 00:15:37.146]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:15:39.247 --> 00:16:01.703]   Infowars.com forward slash crypto is a place where you can donate to InfoWars From more than 20 different crypto systems like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Tether, USD coin, Stellar, and so many others.
[00:16:01.904 --> 00:16:06.025]  And folks have really been donating to that and I'm very, very thankful.
[00:16:06.045 --> 00:16:09.727]  It is really digging us out of the hole here under globalist attack.
[00:16:09.747 --> 00:16:11.627]  I want to thank you for keeping us in the fight.
[00:16:11.647 --> 00:16:12.408]  You know who you are.
[00:16:12.508 --> 00:16:15.089]  InfoWars.com forward slash crypto.
[00:16:17.409 --> 00:16:21.111]  Also, InfoWarsTore.com has great t-shirts, great books, great films.
[00:16:22.112 --> 00:16:32.158]  Before I hit the news, I just want to remind folks that one big area where we're doing accounting, trying to raise extra money for shortfalls, was something they've been telling me for years, but I wasn't listening, because I kind of run everything around here.
[00:16:33.498 --> 00:16:35.159]  And I fly to the seat of my pants a lot of times.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.002]  And so I kept designing every month a new t-shirt, or a couple times a month.
[00:16:39.784 --> 00:16:45.106]  That's why some of the designs are really amazing, some are kind of okay, because it's pretty much me designing them and telling folks what I want.
[00:16:45.126 --> 00:16:49.247]  So I'm not going to say we have the best shirts, but we've got some really good ones and some okay ones.
[00:16:49.487 --> 00:16:50.948]  The point is they're real, they're Americana.
[00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.429]  If I tell you we've got the best supplements, we've got the best supplements.
[00:16:53.449 --> 00:16:55.769]  If I tell you we've got a silver coin that's amazing, it is.
[00:16:55.789 --> 00:16:58.650]  So that's why I've got to be honest with the t-shirts, some are amazing, some are just okay.
[00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:59.891]  The point is they're historic.
[00:17:00.611 --> 00:17:07.593]  I mean, hell, the original Mass Murderers Agree, Gun Control Works shirt, I designed 22, 23 years ago.
[00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:20.080]  Back when the editing software took me like a day of just processing to be able to put a picture of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao on a white shirt and say, mass murderers agree, gun control works.
[00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:23.783]  On the back, peasants or politicians love disarmed peasants.
[00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:25.525]  Infowars.com.
[00:17:27.286 --> 00:17:30.329]  That took me with Photoshop a day to design.
[00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:32.451]  You could design it in five minutes today.
[00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:36.855]  The point is, is that I literally designed that shirt and it'll never be made again.
[00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:46.426]  When these couple hundred designs, some of which have been sitting in the warehouse for five years, that haven't sold, because I wouldn't promote most new designs, when they're gone, they're gone.
[00:17:46.467 --> 00:17:47.188]  They're limited edition.
[00:17:47.468 --> 00:17:48.871]  We're selling all of them at cost.
[00:17:50.379 --> 00:17:52.300]  Except for the Alex Jones Was Right shirt.
[00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.720]  The Alex Jones Was Right shirt with the big red thunderbolt.
[00:17:54.981 --> 00:17:57.621]  And on the back it says, Infowars.com, very nice shirt.
[00:17:57.661 --> 00:18:01.863]  We're selling that at a premium at $24.95 so that we can fund the operation.
[00:18:01.883 --> 00:18:06.685]  So we will make a donation and spread the word and trigger authoritarians everywhere by not letting them silence you.
[00:18:07.405 --> 00:18:09.545]  Infowars.com, Alex Jones Was Right shirts.
[00:18:09.565 --> 00:18:15.648]  But we've already sold out of 60%, I'm told, as of yesterday, of the 63,000 shirts we had in stock.
[00:18:17.881 --> 00:18:22.724]  Again, we had four or five other shirts still coming in, but once those are sold, those will be sold as well at cost.
[00:18:23.285 --> 00:18:26.727]  And we have a designer version of the Alex Jones Wright shirt that just came in.
[00:18:26.747 --> 00:18:29.129]  It's super nice fabric, super fancy.
[00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:31.291]  The shirt cost us like 20 bucks.
[00:18:31.551 --> 00:18:32.912]  We're going to sell it for 40-something dollars.
[00:18:33.492 --> 00:18:38.075]  The regular Alex Jones Wright shirt is like designer fabric, and I thought it was the designer one when it came in.
[00:18:38.095 --> 00:18:39.717]  I said, oh, this is really nice fabric.
[00:18:39.737 --> 00:18:40.537]  This is really nice printing.
[00:18:40.557 --> 00:18:40.998]  They said, no.
[00:18:41.778 --> 00:18:47.362]  That shirt cost us $7.80 to make for the extra large ones, a little bit less for the smaller ones.
[00:18:48.083 --> 00:18:51.105]  So this is really a designer type shirt, but the fancy one has now come in.
[00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:52.706]  It'll be up for sale by next week.
[00:18:53.947 --> 00:18:54.887]  And it's a fundraiser shirt.
[00:18:54.907 --> 00:18:57.009]  So I'm going to stop plugging, but thank you all for your support.
[00:18:57.129 --> 00:19:02.713]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139 or Infowars.com forward slash crypto.
[00:19:02.733 --> 00:19:03.653]  And I want to thank all of you.
[00:19:04.114 --> 00:19:04.834]  You know who we are.
[00:19:05.855 --> 00:19:08.197]  And again, why do the globalists fear this broadcast so much?
[00:19:08.237 --> 00:19:11.039]  Well, if you tuned in the first five minutes of the show, you saw why.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:17.723]  It's gone viral on Twitter, on Taylor Dell's Twitter site.
[00:19:17.743 --> 00:19:26.648]  20 years ago, folks, Alex Jones said, open borders, cashless society, centralized state-run health care, depopulation, release of plagues and viruses.
[00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.390]  And there it is.
[00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:30.250]  Well, how did I know all that?
[00:19:30.771 --> 00:19:32.552]  Because it's in their own plans.
[00:19:32.752 --> 00:19:35.854]  And then a video from four years ago.
[00:19:37.725 --> 00:19:39.666]  Where I predicted everything that happened, we played that.
[00:19:40.226 --> 00:19:41.867]  And I specifically laid out what was coming next.
[00:19:41.927 --> 00:19:45.829]  I mean, we know what's coming next and it's unspeakable hell.
[00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:48.050]  It's unspeakable collapse.
[00:19:49.171 --> 00:19:56.955]  And you've got all these minions of the corporate and governmental system and ecclesiastical system and the education system as well.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:03.807]  Going along with this breakdown of civilization, they believe it's their cloward and piven communist takeover.
[00:20:04.448 --> 00:20:12.920]  No, it's a permanent, long-term, post-industrial world where almost everyone even serving the system will be dead or in a forced labor camp before it's all over.
[00:20:14.178 --> 00:20:16.660]  Please turn back now, minions of the system.
[00:20:16.721 --> 00:20:20.424]  Please realize, historically, you are guaranteed going down a bad path.
[00:20:20.825 --> 00:20:22.466]  I know evil is fascinating to you.
[00:20:22.526 --> 00:20:27.912]  I know the thought of being a powerful thug with a machine gun ruling over us in death camps really excites you.
[00:20:28.372 --> 00:20:31.896]  And they're salivating everywhere wanting to arrest all Trump supporters right now over the news.
[00:20:32.416 --> 00:20:34.578]  That's not going to result in what you think.
[00:20:34.919 --> 00:20:36.740]  That's designed to bring the country down.
[00:20:37.648 --> 00:20:46.713]  Trying to execute that operation against the American people is a suicide mission of any major army, much less the Justice Department.
[00:20:46.733 --> 00:20:49.575]  And I'm not saying it's a suicide mission because I'm going to physically fight it.
[00:20:49.895 --> 00:20:51.236]  No, I'm trying to stop all this.
[00:20:51.496 --> 00:20:52.717]  I'm trying to stop the Civil War.
[00:20:54.121 --> 00:20:57.763]  All you got to do is turn on the news and see them pushing a civil war.
[00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.364]  I don't want our country torn apart.
[00:20:59.805 --> 00:21:11.713]  I don't want violence against any group, organization, whether it's the private citizens of the government or corporations, because we have a problem of good and evil in this country, in the world, and you're not going to fix it just taking out the figureheads.
[00:21:11.813 --> 00:21:24.041]  We've got to fundamentally change who we are in our hearts, as Jesus Christ said, and then be examples in the world to change the world and then not submit to evil and be civilly disobedient.
[00:21:24.441 --> 00:21:29.383]  Like Jesus did, like Mahatma Gandhi did, and like Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:21:29.403 --> 00:21:33.064]  did, the example of Christ was the new type of warfare.
[00:21:34.804 --> 00:21:43.967]  Knowing how to turn the cheek, knowing how to then stand up though and rebuke those, and then they get down in the gutter and then they lose the fight.
[00:21:44.007 --> 00:21:44.807]  What did Gandhi say?
[00:21:46.327 --> 00:21:49.508]  Any true leader who's trying to free the people will go through this process.
[00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:51.589]  First, they ignore you.
[00:21:53.424 --> 00:22:01.088]  Then they laugh at you, then they attack you, kill you, imprison you, and then you win.
[00:22:01.108 --> 00:22:02.929]  You understand that?
[00:22:03.189 --> 00:22:04.029]  It always works that way.
[00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:12.954]  When you have Ryland on your side, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then they lose.
[00:22:15.208 --> 00:22:15.989]  Just remember that.
[00:22:16.169 --> 00:22:22.032]  Everything good we've got, everybody knows this, is because our forebears stood up for what was right and for human justice.
[00:22:22.353 --> 00:22:24.634]  Didn't mean when they started trying to fix things everything was perfect.
[00:22:24.854 --> 00:22:26.395]  It took them a long time in the processes.
[00:22:27.116 --> 00:22:38.423]  But the state of liberty and freedom and transparency we'd had took hundreds of years of the Renaissance to develop and in just a few short decades it's being burned down to the ground.
[00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:54.882]  And there is a certain exhilaration and manicness to tyrants and their minions while they're ransacking the castle, while they're burning down the village, while they're raping and pillaging, but they find in the morning then there's nothing left to live off of.
[00:22:56.664 --> 00:23:00.867]  And they try to move on to the next village, the next town, except then they run out of villages and towns.
[00:23:02.529 --> 00:23:11.602]   Or more of the not, the villages and towns band together when the barbarians come, And they stand against the barbarians, and they defeat them together.
[00:23:12.344 --> 00:23:17.056]  And so you're going to have to decide whether to do this the easy way, folks, or the hard way.
[00:23:17.096 --> 00:23:18.078]  But I counted the cost.
[00:23:19.366 --> 00:23:32.457]  And I believed in you, and I knew that if we exposed the New World Order, if we talked about what it was going to do, and then when it came true, the first phases of it, we'd have a really good shot at beating it, because we would have already laid out that this was coming, and people were really impressed with that.
[00:23:32.697 --> 00:23:42.385]  When you can tell them 10, 20, 25, 30 years before what's going to happen, to the T, then even the laziest people go, I better go research what he knows.
[00:23:42.685 --> 00:23:45.468]  Because as we speak, it's all over the news, like it's no big deal.
[00:23:45.968 --> 00:23:48.008]  Oh yeah, the UN's going to run our health care in America.
[00:23:48.329 --> 00:23:51.709]  Fauci says, yeah, you don't have Congress doing that, or you don't have the legislatures.
[00:23:52.009 --> 00:23:54.490]  No, no, no, it's not even the executive, it's the UN.
[00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.050]  Well, of course the UN runs it.
[00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.470]  I mean, duh!
[00:23:58.911 --> 00:24:04.792]  We're going into a totally tyrannical world government whose endgame is killing you and your family.
[00:24:05.532 --> 00:24:06.472]  And that's all over the news.
[00:24:06.512 --> 00:24:07.973]  They say, yeah, we want to depopulate everybody.
[00:24:08.513 --> 00:24:11.413]  At the Nabos Group, and then I talk about it, the New York Times says he's psychotic.
[00:24:11.753 --> 00:24:13.414]  He says the globalists want to depopulate.
[00:24:13.654 --> 00:24:13.974]  Yeah!
[00:24:14.895 --> 00:24:19.078]  All right, let's drill into the COVID biomedical tyranny takeover stack here.
[00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:23.922]  It is extremely, extremely important, obviously.
[00:24:23.942 --> 00:24:25.763]  I already played this clip.
[00:24:25.783 --> 00:24:26.964]  I'm gonna play it one more time.
[00:24:27.024 --> 00:24:30.506]  This is former President Barack Hussein Obama.
[00:24:31.147 --> 00:24:35.610]  He says, we have now essentially clinically tested the vaccine on billions worldwide.
[00:24:37.131 --> 00:24:39.393]  Again, let's go over the lies here.
[00:24:41.704 --> 00:24:43.265]  They lied and said it had been clinically tested.
[00:24:43.325 --> 00:24:43.705]  It hadn't.
[00:24:43.745 --> 00:24:45.046]  They lied and said it was a vaccine.
[00:24:45.086 --> 00:24:45.546]  It wasn't.
[00:24:45.586 --> 00:24:46.387]  This is all fact.
[00:24:47.307 --> 00:24:50.709]  And now he admits that he can't pick millions of people, but he says it's safe.
[00:24:51.349 --> 00:24:54.071]  And anybody that doesn't say it's safe should be shut down.
[00:24:55.432 --> 00:24:56.152]  Should be silenced.
[00:24:57.833 --> 00:24:58.813]  That's disinformation.
[00:24:58.833 --> 00:25:00.054]  And that ties into the next story.
[00:25:00.534 --> 00:25:08.559]  Breaking Biden administration creates Disinformation Governance Board under DHS to fight misinformation.
[00:25:09.898 --> 00:25:11.879]  And I believe we have that clip in here.
[00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:14.141]  We do not have that clip.
[00:25:14.501 --> 00:25:17.303]  Get that for me, guys, because clip 13.
[00:25:17.803 --> 00:25:18.363]  Okay, I do.
[00:25:19.104 --> 00:25:20.545]  I do want to get to that clip here in a moment.
[00:25:20.565 --> 00:25:25.928]  But first, let's get into this COVID stack that it ties into.
[00:25:30.748 --> 00:25:31.348]  Preprint.
[00:25:31.729 --> 00:25:36.691]  SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can elicit CD8 T-cell dominant hepatitis.
[00:25:37.411 --> 00:25:42.014]  Now they already knew that, but little kids are getting hepatitis all over the world, and it's from the vaccine.
[00:25:42.034 --> 00:25:42.674]  It's hitting their liver.
[00:25:43.074 --> 00:25:44.075]  A virus is hitting their liver.
[00:25:44.375 --> 00:25:45.435]  What do you think the vaccine is?
[00:25:45.515 --> 00:25:46.016]  It's a virus.
[00:25:46.356 --> 00:25:47.276]  A prion crystal.
[00:25:48.497 --> 00:25:49.537]  Hepatitis outbreak.
[00:25:50.478 --> 00:25:52.479]  Even mainstream news reports it's the vaccine.
[00:25:56.667 --> 00:26:02.593]  Hepatitis outbreak in children may be a coincidence of COVID lockdowns weakened immunity.
[00:26:03.053 --> 00:26:04.214]  The media tries to spin it.
[00:26:05.455 --> 00:26:09.419]  While Rhode Island takes steps to prevent potential hepatitis A outbreak.
[00:26:09.739 --> 00:26:12.162]  Oh, well take your shots, that'll stop it.
[00:26:12.742 --> 00:26:17.427]  Wonder what's causing this outbreak as Rhode Island moves for forced inoculation.
[00:26:18.783 --> 00:26:26.927]  And then just like Israel with basically forced inoculation, you'll wonder why you have the highest rates of blood clots, heart attacks, and this new crazy thing that eats your liver.
[00:26:27.127 --> 00:26:28.128]  Gee, what could it be?
[00:26:28.728 --> 00:26:31.469]  What did we tell you two years ago that these gene therapies tend to do?
[00:26:32.009 --> 00:26:33.410]  In a small percentage of people, they do it.
[00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:34.210]  Eat your liver.
[00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.432]  Oh, here's another one.
[00:26:37.212 --> 00:26:43.155]  SARS-CoV-2 vaccination can elicit a CD8 T-cell dominant hepatitis.
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:49.322]  And here it is right here in the Journal of Hepatitis Pathology.
[00:26:49.643 --> 00:26:50.443]  Very prestigious.
[00:26:50.723 --> 00:26:53.404]  You might want to go read this for yourself if you care.
[00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:56.006]  Or just give them the experimental shot and see what happens.
[00:26:57.346 --> 00:26:58.147]  Here's more of the studies.
[00:27:00.481 --> 00:27:02.561]  Meanwhile, Fauci clarifies U.S.
[00:27:02.922 --> 00:27:09.983]  out of acute component of pandemic phase, but Saki comes out and contradicts him and says, no, it's not.
[00:27:10.263 --> 00:27:12.564]  So these lying criminals can't even get their lives straight.
[00:27:13.124 --> 00:27:16.765]  Just in, Congresswoman Maxine Waters says she has tested positive for COVID.
[00:27:17.145 --> 00:27:20.165]  I'm grateful to be fully vaccinated and have received two booster shots.
[00:27:21.666 --> 00:27:23.286]  And boy, these people are dropping dead fast.
[00:27:24.807 --> 00:27:26.927]  Much as I hate them, I hate seeing people hurt themselves.
[00:27:27.788 --> 00:27:31.948]  WHO says pandemic justifies leader's pitch at Moderna meeting.
[00:27:31.968 --> 00:27:39.830]  The UN now officially, Reuters reports, will be promoting Moderna, the strongest one that has triple the side effects of even the Pfizer.
[00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:47.792]  Haley Bieber had a heart surgery after scary blood clot caused mini-stroke after she took the shot.
[00:27:48.092 --> 00:27:48.912]  Yeah, very young woman.
[00:27:51.135 --> 00:27:56.602]  NIH study finds those with shots had fewer antibodies even after COVID infection.
[00:27:59.505 --> 00:27:59.926]  You hear that?
[00:27:59.966 --> 00:28:01.227]  That's mainstream news.
[00:28:01.908 --> 00:28:07.294]  That's the NIH reporting that the vaccine erases your immune system and you get COVID more often.
[00:28:07.334 --> 00:28:10.018]  Other studies show that as well, but it's okay.
[00:28:11.213 --> 00:28:17.364]   COVID mandates for White House correspondence dinners don't apply to all only certain people are forced to do it like
[00:28:17.364 --> 00:28:21.663]   the cooks and the workers They got to wear masks all the elitist won't I mean, this
[00:28:21.663 --> 00:28:25.673]   is a true Class system under Islam the women have to cover their
[00:28:25.673 --> 00:28:33.842]   faces wonder the new world order just all us commoners do Let's go ahead since I mentioned it and play that Obama
[00:28:33.842 --> 00:28:36.493]   clip just you can hear it for yourself one more time before I
[00:28:36.493 --> 00:28:41.134]   Hit the rest of the story Despite the fact that we've now
[00:28:41.134 --> 00:28:47.252]   Essentially clinically tested the vaccine on billions of people worldwide
[00:28:47.252 --> 00:28:48.252]  Goodbye.
[00:28:48.252 --> 00:28:51.233]  [ Silence ]
[00:28:51.670 --> 00:28:58.955]  Around one in five Americans is still willing to put themselves at risk and put their families at risk rather than get vaccinated.
[00:29:02.078 --> 00:29:04.460]  People are dying because of misinformation.
[00:29:06.881 --> 00:29:08.723]  Just incredible lies, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:09.424 --> 00:29:20.795]  And here is Mayorkas, who's got the border completely light up, and they're getting rid of Title 42 to even check for any diseases from third world countries, or weapons, or that people aren't smuggling children, which we know goes on on a mass scale.
[00:29:21.656 --> 00:29:22.897]  Senate reports all confirmed.
[00:29:23.218 --> 00:29:24.139]  And then Obama, by the way.
[00:29:25.345 --> 00:29:26.126]  Oversaw all that.
[00:29:26.166 --> 00:29:28.028]  Well, now it's much, much bigger under Biden.
[00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:35.115]  Here is Secretary of Homeland Security Mayorkas says disinformation governance board is being created to counter misinformation.
[00:29:35.135 --> 00:29:37.297]  That means criticizing his treason.
[00:29:37.317 --> 00:29:37.678]  Here it is.
[00:29:38.677 --> 00:29:41.678]  Another huge threat to our homeland is myths and disinformation.
[00:29:42.078 --> 00:29:49.661]  You noted that it's a concern of yours at the border, with human smuggling organizations peddling misinformation to exploit vulnerable migrants for profit.
[00:29:50.141 --> 00:29:58.644]  One of my main concerns about disinformation is that foreign adversaries attempt to destabilize our elections by targeting people of color with disinformation campaigns.
[00:29:59.264 --> 00:30:12.548]  After it became clear that there was foreign meddling in our 2016 election, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence authored a report on the disinformation tactics used by Russia's Internet Research Agency, the IRA, to interfere in the election.
[00:30:12.588 --> 00:30:19.770]  The report found that, quote, no single group of Americans was targeted by the IRA information operatives more than African Americans.
[00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:31.698]  A newer trend that we saw in the 2020 election and already in the 2022 midterms is that disinformation is being heavily targeted at Spanish-speaking voters, sparking and fueling conspiracy theories.
[00:30:32.403 --> 00:30:36.686]  DHS and its components play a big role in addressing myths and disinformation.
[00:30:37.086 --> 00:30:38.327]  I can't listen to any more of this.
[00:30:38.347 --> 00:30:41.649]  I mean, you've got 99% of the corporate media is anti-freedom.
[00:30:41.989 --> 00:30:43.490]  You've got globalists destroying everything.
[00:30:43.510 --> 00:30:45.251]  You have Hollywood drinking blood on TV.
[00:30:45.811 --> 00:30:48.433]  You have men competing in women's sports.
[00:30:48.853 --> 00:30:54.516]  We have the Department of Education announcing they're going to sexualize, basically pedophilize children at age 5.
[00:30:54.616 --> 00:30:55.257]  My God!
[00:30:55.797 --> 00:31:02.001]  And you wonder why we don't like you, lady, or trust you, and then you call us to say, oh, black people don't believe Democrats anymore.
[00:31:02.321 --> 00:31:04.122]  Oh, Hispanics don't believe the gut.
[00:31:04.162 --> 00:31:06.383]  Well, I mean, who the hell would believe people like you?
[00:31:07.024 --> 00:31:09.005]  Don't give a rat's ass what color you are, lady.
[00:31:09.285 --> 00:31:10.226]  You work for evil.
[00:31:10.506 --> 00:31:11.086]  Good Lord!
[00:31:11.106 --> 00:31:15.289]  And our big problem is the Republicans at the top are almost as bad.
[00:31:16.533 --> 00:31:17.193]  Here's the headlines.
[00:31:17.713 --> 00:31:22.875]  Biden administration creates disinformation governance board under DHS to fight misinformation.
[00:31:22.915 --> 00:31:24.756]  That's literally out of 1984.
[00:31:24.936 --> 00:31:27.317]  Everybody overuses Hitler.
[00:31:27.617 --> 00:31:29.097]  Everybody overuses Stalin.
[00:31:29.377 --> 00:31:30.137]  Everybody overuses 1984.
[00:31:30.778 --> 00:31:33.559]  But this is directly a ministry of truth.
[00:31:33.579 --> 00:31:40.381]  And they're all over the news saying, oh come back with this, that Alex Jones needs to be arrested for his misinformation.
[00:31:42.061 --> 00:31:43.722]  That was always the logical extension of this.
[00:31:45.555 --> 00:31:46.958]  They're coming for your children.
[00:31:47.218 --> 00:31:50.845]  They're injecting your children with something that gives them viral hepatitis on record.
[00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:52.889]  You think these are nice people?
[00:31:53.189 --> 00:32:01.531]  I got articles out, millions of children in the US, 600,000 in the UK, serious clinical depression, mass suicide from the lockdowns.
[00:32:01.671 --> 00:32:04.852]  Of course they knew what they were doing.
[00:32:05.112 --> 00:32:06.753]  This is psychological warfare.
[00:32:07.313 --> 00:32:08.353]  But we're lucky here in the West.
[00:32:08.713 --> 00:32:13.654]  We didn't get our food cut off for almost two years like Africa, where an extra 10 million people starved to death.
[00:32:13.954 --> 00:32:16.155]  Worldwide, an extra 25 million now.
[00:32:17.875 --> 00:32:19.195]  Oh, but those are just raw numbers, right?
[00:32:19.215 --> 00:32:21.216]  They don't humanize that all day.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.882]  It just goes on and on.
[00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:29.934]  Biden starts disinformation board led by Russia expert who called Hunter's laptop Trump product.
[00:32:30.194 --> 00:32:32.980]  Yeah, that's another thing about that speech by that congresswoman I was just showing you.
[00:32:33.421 --> 00:32:34.143]  Talking to Mayorkas.
[00:32:34.729 --> 00:32:39.009]  They say, "Oh, the Russians meddled in 2016 and 2020."
[00:32:39.009 --> 00:32:41.009]  Oh, the Russians.
[00:32:41.009 --> 00:32:42.288]  The Russians' propaganda.
[00:32:42.288 --> 00:32:48.168]   I'm not trying to knock the Russians, but I would describe Russian propaganda as hillbilly-like.
[00:32:48.168 --> 00:32:52.328]   And I'm not meaning that mean, but I mean, the Chinese are very sophisticated, the Israelis
[00:32:52.328 --> 00:32:56.087]   are sophisticated, the British are sophisticated, the EU is somewhat.
[00:32:56.087 --> 00:32:58.087]  The Hollywood globalists are the most sophisticated.
[00:32:58.108 --> 00:33:00.690]  You see their propaganda everywhere, and they're brainwashing.
[00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:02.491]  They're the ones sexualizing your children.
[00:33:02.511 --> 00:33:03.732]  They're the ones with drag queen story time.
[00:33:04.032 --> 00:33:05.533]  They're the ones with men and women's sports.
[00:33:05.893 --> 00:33:11.877]  I mean, the Russians literally are amateurs, ladies and gentlemen, when it comes to something like this.
[00:33:12.037 --> 00:33:18.161]  And the idea that Russians run Trump, or Russians run me, and we now know the dossiers were all fake, and they made them up, of course it was fake!
[00:33:19.502 --> 00:33:20.143]  This is crazy.
[00:33:21.229 --> 00:33:22.190]  We're the Americans.
[00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:23.411]  We care about the country.
[00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:24.832]  We care about the dollar.
[00:33:25.132 --> 00:33:26.713]  We care about the factories and the farms.
[00:33:27.114 --> 00:33:28.735]  We care about the school teachers and the children.
[00:33:29.015 --> 00:33:30.437]  We're not the ones dissolving the border.
[00:33:30.677 --> 00:33:32.338]  We're not the ones getting rid of Title 42.
[00:33:32.578 --> 00:33:34.280]  We're not the ones destroying everything.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.002]  It's the New World Order and the Democratic Party.
[00:33:37.222 --> 00:33:38.063]  They are cancer!
[00:33:38.123 --> 00:33:38.683]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:40.725 --> 00:33:42.746]  My friends, thank you so much for being here with us.
[00:33:44.328 --> 00:33:46.790]  In this epic journey we are all together sharing.
[00:33:48.354 --> 00:33:52.177]  All right, let's get into why they feared the broadcast before I hit this.
[00:33:52.897 --> 00:34:00.082]  Ministry of Truth publicly being established to persecute and destroy and annihilate the free peoples of Earth.
[00:34:01.002 --> 00:34:08.808]  Here is a clip from 2002 where I lay out what was coming and what was going to unfold.
[00:34:09.228 --> 00:34:12.950]  And I ask you, is this disinformation or is this the blood of truth?
[00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:13.471]  Here it is.
[00:34:14.264 --> 00:34:15.745]  The facts and common sense are in.
[00:34:15.885 --> 00:34:17.526]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires.
[00:34:17.666 --> 00:34:18.766]  Yes, they manipulate.
[00:34:18.906 --> 00:34:20.587]  Yes, there are secret societies.
[00:34:20.928 --> 00:34:23.029]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history.
[00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:40.078]  And yes, today, in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:43.792]  We're human beings are absolutely worthless.
[00:34:44.373 --> 00:34:53.324]  There's six and a quarter plus billion of us, and the globalists have said it many times, there's too many of us, we're causing a problem, we need to be culled at the tune of 80%.
[00:34:53.484 --> 00:35:09.060]   It's amazing to talk about that, but it's the globalists, the UN, their own public statements, and they've convinced a lot of Liberals and elitist conservatives and others, that by going along with this, that we're intelligent members of society.
[00:35:09.801 --> 00:35:12.984]  It's the ultimate Malthus worldview.
[00:35:13.184 --> 00:35:20.351]  It is this radical, virulent form of social Darwinism.
[00:35:20.471 --> 00:35:23.193]  It's the excuse of tyrants.
[00:35:24.286 --> 00:35:38.032]  And by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources, by centralizing and socializing health care, the state becomes God, basically, when it comes to your health.
[00:35:38.392 --> 00:35:45.275]  And then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us, we then basically get shoved into their system.
[00:35:46.721 --> 00:35:49.662]  We then basically get shoved into their system.
[00:35:49.702 --> 00:35:50.742]  That's why they hate me.
[00:35:51.462 --> 00:35:54.143]  Because we are directly over the target.
[00:35:54.163 --> 00:35:55.423]  We are in the Matrix.
[00:35:55.463 --> 00:36:00.544]  We are in the zeitgeist contending with their Agent Smiths at point-blank range.
[00:36:02.024 --> 00:36:05.005]  And they know their attempts to censor have failed.
[00:36:06.185 --> 00:36:09.446]  And so they now come for me and you.
[00:36:10.555 --> 00:36:14.238]  Breaking, and I mentioned this, but I got sick of listening to the Congresswoman.
[00:36:14.258 --> 00:36:28.769]  Here's the actual clip out of the clip of the head of DHS, Mayorkas, saying that, yes, we're establishing this disinformation committee that will then go out and order anyone censored they want or call for the FBI to go after whoever they want.
[00:36:28.989 --> 00:36:29.729]  That's what they're saying.
[00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:32.191]  Or even have the CIA go after people.
[00:36:32.972 --> 00:36:39.417]  And then, of course, put out announced facts that we're supposed to receive as gospel absolute truth.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:45.445]  Congresswoman, we have a number of different offices engaged in this critical effort.
[00:36:45.806 --> 00:36:55.736]  Of course, our Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has an entire effort focused on election security as part of its mission set.
[00:36:56.097 --> 00:37:00.101]  Our Office of Policy, Office of Planning, Policy and Strategy.
[00:37:01.322 --> 00:37:03.323]  Also, is a leading effort.
[00:37:04.603 --> 00:37:22.690]  Our Undersecretary for Policy, Rob Silvers, is co-chair with our Principal Deputy General Counsel, Jennifer Daskal, in leading a just recently constituted Misinformation Disinformation Governance Board.
[00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:30.581]   So we're bringing, the goal is to bring the resources of the Department Together to address this threat. I just read a very
[00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:38.971]   interesting study that underscores the importance Of the the point that you make the spread of myths and disinformation
[00:37:38.971 --> 00:37:45.451]   in minority communities Specifically and we are focused on that in the context of
[00:37:45.451 --> 00:37:51.652]   our cp3 and other efforts Translated brown folks ain't drinking the kool-aid no more
[00:37:51.652 --> 00:37:55.570]   and neither are white folks that we're coming together and that's got the system scared
[00:37:56.331 --> 00:38:03.242]   so continuing Biden starts disinformation board led by Russia expert who called hunters Biden's laptop a product
[00:38:03.242 --> 00:38:09.360]   of Trump and said it was all fake The thousands of pedophile images, videos, the crack smoking, all of it was fake.
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.001]  Of course, it was all, all real.
[00:38:12.842 --> 00:38:14.262]  And folks point this out.
[00:38:14.382 --> 00:38:24.727]  Jason Hawthorne points out on Twitter, I know 1984 references are a little stale, but the government creating an actual ministry of truth is a little too on the nose for me.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:39.010]  And here is the actual FCC FTC document, DOJ, where the left and the Justice Department's own subgroups asked that, wait for it, Elon Musk not be able to buy Twitter.
[00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:42.372]  This is a threat to free speech and democracy.
[00:38:42.412 --> 00:38:48.300]   So if you don't censor, And if you don't shut down free speech, you're hurting free speech.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:54.283]  The head of the FCC rejects call for FCC to block must purchase of Twitter.
[00:38:54.743 --> 00:38:55.943]  Now let's move to this.
[00:38:55.983 --> 00:39:00.426]  And I don't want to spend much time on myself, but it's very important in the larger areas.
[00:39:00.646 --> 00:39:02.787]  So I only cover stuff about myself when it's really key.
[00:39:03.127 --> 00:39:04.688]  But we're in central this for a reason.
[00:39:04.708 --> 00:39:06.989]  We know what we're talking about.
[00:39:08.509 --> 00:39:13.352]  They have articles in the Texas newspapers, the New York Times, just all I mean, I got over 100 alerts on this today.
[00:39:14.997 --> 00:39:20.341]  Saying Alex Jones has gone to the January 6th Committee and he basically admits he's guilty and he's going to expose Trump and everything.
[00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:21.802]  Total lies, none of it's true.
[00:39:21.822 --> 00:39:24.765]  The Justice Department kept calling here over and over again to our lawyers.
[00:39:25.205 --> 00:39:26.726]  For the last three months, we said no.
[00:39:27.126 --> 00:39:37.835]  And we said, if you drop the charges on Owen, who did nothing wrong, and you send us written questions and you give me immunity so you don't lie and say that I perjured myself, they'll just have a witness say I lied.
[00:39:37.855 --> 00:39:39.096]  It won't matter if I'm telling the truth.
[00:39:39.816 --> 00:39:40.857]  I'm not going to be Martha Stewart.
[00:39:41.237 --> 00:39:42.198]  Then I will talk to you.
[00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:49.119]   If somebody comes to your door, And says, we want to talk to you, and you open the door and talk to him.
[00:39:49.159 --> 00:39:50.040]  Are you reaching out?
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:53.142]  No, but again, oh, he's in trouble.
[00:39:53.603 --> 00:39:56.145]  Oh, he admits he did it.
[00:39:56.325 --> 00:39:59.068]  I mean, it's just, it's so evil.
[00:40:00.189 --> 00:40:01.209]  So here's another one of the articles.
[00:40:01.289 --> 00:40:04.612]  Facing judgment, Alex Jones pleads for help from the deep state.
[00:40:04.973 --> 00:40:15.078]   So now, going to a federal court, access to state or federal courts, Going to a federal court and saying, they claim I have hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:40:15.178 --> 00:40:16.179]  I don't have ten million dollars.
[00:40:16.219 --> 00:40:17.220]  I don't have five million dollars.
[00:40:18.501 --> 00:40:20.602]  They already have found me guilty without a trial.
[00:40:21.483 --> 00:40:23.304]  So, here, I'm in bankruptcy.
[00:40:24.605 --> 00:40:25.666]  You know how much money I have?
[00:40:25.826 --> 00:40:26.106]  Fine.
[00:40:26.666 --> 00:40:29.648]  Just, I don't want the show trials this summer and this fall.
[00:40:29.688 --> 00:40:31.570]  Three Sandy Hook show trials, be on TV everywhere.
[00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:32.730]  I'm not scared of that.
[00:40:33.631 --> 00:40:39.515]  But it'll be a fiasco and it's a lie and it's a fraud and it's not a real trial where I'm not even allowed to defend myself.
[00:40:39.555 --> 00:40:40.276]  I'm already guilty.
[00:40:41.852 --> 00:40:44.373]  So I go to the federal court hoping it's a little better.
[00:40:45.173 --> 00:40:47.573]  And that turns into, I've gone to the deep state.
[00:40:47.653 --> 00:40:49.474]  No, the deep state is the controlled media.
[00:40:49.774 --> 00:40:56.856]  The deep state is the Justice Department calling up our bankruptcy people, calling up the judge's office.
[00:40:58.376 --> 00:40:59.976]  This is coming out next week, okay?
[00:41:00.016 --> 00:41:02.977]  I've been asked not to get into it too much until the documents are all prepared.
[00:41:02.997 --> 00:41:08.078]  But I mean, no one's ever seen this, where the Justice Department says Alex Jones doesn't get access to the courts.
[00:41:08.098 --> 00:41:08.639]  That's what they said.
[00:41:08.659 --> 00:41:09.819]  They said, we're not going to allow it.
[00:41:10.379 --> 00:41:11.380]  Well, they said, you don't have the authority.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.020]  Well, just watch.
[00:41:12.921 --> 00:41:14.002]  We have the emails, we have it all.
[00:41:14.062 --> 00:41:15.803]  So these people are out of their minds.
[00:41:16.263 --> 00:41:17.744]  Is that me going to the deep state?
[00:41:18.084 --> 00:41:27.311]  Going to a public federal judge and asking for a trustee to come in and actually look at our books so they'll stop lying about all this crap?
[00:41:28.863 --> 00:41:45.338]  Imagine what I just said is the truth, and how far that is from Elizabeth Williams that makes her living off Sandy Hook at the New York Times, while this literal Decepticon claims that I cut my teeth, made my bones, and my quote, empire and fortune, off of Sandy Hook.
[00:41:45.418 --> 00:41:46.319]  It's all a lie.
[00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:47.220]  There's the article.
[00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.501]  Here's another one out of the Texas Tribune.
[00:41:48.861 --> 00:41:51.223]  How Sandy Hook lies in January 6th inquiry.
[00:41:51.544 --> 00:41:53.025]  Threatened to undo Alex Jones.
[00:41:53.245 --> 00:41:53.726]  Oh yeah!
[00:41:54.844 --> 00:41:56.806]  No mention of how we tried to stop January 6th.
[00:41:56.846 --> 00:41:58.708]  No mention of how we called for peace.
[00:41:59.029 --> 00:42:00.991]  No mention of how we stopped thousands going in the building.
[00:42:01.351 --> 00:42:03.273]  No, it's all Alex Jones ran January 6th.
[00:42:05.183 --> 00:42:08.164]  And it goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:42:08.284 --> 00:42:10.724]  Very important information.
[00:42:10.744 --> 00:42:12.205]  I got a bunch on Twitter coming up.
[00:42:12.865 --> 00:42:14.645]  I want to open the phones up, take your calls.
[00:42:15.205 --> 00:42:18.326]  I want to get into the economy news, more on the war news.
[00:42:18.366 --> 00:42:19.366]  Haven't got into that yet.
[00:42:19.766 --> 00:42:21.327]  Only got Putin threatening nuclear war.
[00:42:21.347 --> 00:42:24.768]  I'm gonna get into the rest of that stack and just all these other stacks.
[00:42:24.828 --> 00:42:28.929]  Hollywood, public blood drinking, Biden saying he owns and controls your kids.
[00:42:30.689 --> 00:42:38.453]  Department of Education along with the state legislatures controlled by Democrats in over 20 states saying we're going to teach sexualization to children as the new order.
[00:42:39.293 --> 00:42:41.274]  Just like the CIA and others in Germany.
[00:42:41.834 --> 00:42:46.676]  Hundreds of thousands of kids taken from Christian families given to pedophiles to create the new love.
[00:42:47.176 --> 00:42:49.858]  Men with boys, women with girls to depopulate.
[00:42:50.398 --> 00:42:51.458]  They're just creating a new family.
[00:42:51.658 --> 00:42:52.919]  They actually say it in the news.
[00:42:53.319 --> 00:42:59.202]  Democrat legislators want children taught sex specifically, pleasure-based sexual relations and the new family.
[00:43:00.339 --> 00:43:00.980]  That's coming up.
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.241]  I mean, these people are the bad guys.
[00:43:03.742 --> 00:43:05.944]  And they know they're caught, so they're going for broke now.
[00:43:06.344 --> 00:43:07.865]  All they've got to do is not let them gaslight us.
[00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:08.366]  We're going to win.

[00:44:07.541 --> 00:44:13.541]   This program contains language and sequences some viewers may find disturbing.
[00:44:14.313 --> 00:44:17.494]  The nation and all of our freedoms hang by a thread!
[00:44:17.635 --> 00:44:21.136]  And the military apparatus of this country is about to be handed over to scum!
[00:44:21.556 --> 00:44:23.537]  For beholden to scum!

[00:44:41.894 --> 00:44:43.577]  The function of all life is survival.

[00:45:13.890 --> 00:45:14.811]  We're coming!
[00:45:15.572 --> 00:45:16.333]  Sleep.
[00:45:16.413 --> 00:45:17.494]  The seed is planted.
[00:45:17.534 --> 00:45:18.274]  Sleep.
[00:45:19.496 --> 00:45:20.296]  Sleep.
[00:45:20.457 --> 00:45:21.598]  Terror grows.
[00:45:21.658 --> 00:45:23.139]  Elizabeth, wake up!
[00:45:23.159 --> 00:45:25.181]  We'll get you when you sleep!
[00:45:25.381 --> 00:45:26.883]  Sit up!
[00:45:27.043 --> 00:45:29.445]  Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
[00:45:30.706 --> 00:45:32.668]  All of a sudden they're growing like parasites.
[00:45:32.748 --> 00:45:33.729]  Is it contagious?
[00:45:38.544 --> 00:45:45.755]  Now, the classic fear begins to grow.
[00:45:45.996 --> 00:45:47.959]  We're being cornered!
[00:45:47.839 --> 00:45:50.839]  In a modern masterpiece of science fiction.
[00:45:50.839 --> 00:45:52.839]  Embarrassing street.
[00:45:52.839 --> 00:45:55.839]  Invasion of the body slashers.
[00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:58.839]  The land of the walking dead!
[00:45:58.839 --> 00:45:59.839]  Death!
[00:45:59.839 --> 00:46:26.839]  Aborted babies incinerated to heat the UK hospitals.
[00:46:27.602 --> 00:46:31.504]  Soylent Green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[00:46:31.784 --> 00:46:38.007]  But now, children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[00:46:38.027 --> 00:46:42.870]  They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:45.531]  What is the secret?
[00:46:48.038 --> 00:46:50.079]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[00:46:50.539 --> 00:46:52.720]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:57.282]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soylent Green is in short supply.
[00:46:58.022 --> 00:47:00.763]  Remember, Tuesday is Soylent Green Day.
[00:47:01.043 --> 00:47:03.904]  The supply of Soylent Green has been exhausted.
[00:47:03.964 --> 00:47:20.748]   You must evacuate The federal court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Bilderberg Group Company, are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for in the flavoring, but we already know.
[00:47:21.408 --> 00:47:23.289]  So enjoy the flavor.
[00:47:23.389 --> 00:47:27.831]  We're going to get the real solution, which is going to be a combination of death panels and sales taxes.
[00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:29.552]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[00:47:29.993 --> 00:47:31.513]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[00:47:31.874 --> 00:47:33.114]  I'm for regular suicide.
[00:47:33.194 --> 00:47:34.755]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[00:47:34.935 --> 00:47:38.757]  He is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient.
[00:47:39.338 --> 00:47:46.382]  Would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[00:47:46.402 --> 00:47:50.564]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[00:47:50.604 --> 00:47:57.604]   They told me to say that they were sorry, but that you had become unreliable.
[00:47:57.604 --> 00:47:59.604]  [laughs]
[00:47:59.604 --> 00:48:04.604]  [music]
[00:48:04.604 --> 00:48:07.604]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[00:48:07.903 --> 00:48:12.325]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[00:48:12.805 --> 00:48:14.586]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[00:48:15.326 --> 00:48:24.650]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison guards, on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[00:48:24.690 --> 00:48:27.211]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[00:48:28.432 --> 00:48:31.373]  The scoops are on their way!
[00:48:31.433 --> 00:48:33.154]  The scoops are on their way!
[00:48:33.174 --> 00:48:38.559]   I repeat, You will find out why Soylent Green means life.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.061]  You will find out why Soylent Green means death.
[00:48:42.141 --> 00:48:43.602]  We've got to stop them!
[00:48:43.882 --> 00:48:44.422]  Come on!
[00:48:44.442 --> 00:48:47.323]  That is the secret of Soylent Green.
[00:48:47.523 --> 00:48:49.524]  Soylent Green is people!
[00:48:49.544 --> 00:48:51.845]  You've got to warn them.
[00:48:52.606 --> 00:48:53.346]  You've got to tell them.
[00:48:53.846 --> 00:48:57.468]  Next thing they'll be breeding us like cattle.
[00:48:57.488 --> 00:48:57.648]  Explode.
[00:48:57.668 --> 00:48:59.589]  They'll be breeding us like cattle.
[00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:02.890]  You've got to warn them.
[00:49:03.450 --> 00:49:04.431]  You've got to warn them.
[00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:06.591]  Infowars.com.
[00:49:07.592 --> 00:49:10.115]  Don't give Bill Gates a ride.
[00:49:11.156 --> 00:49:13.418]  Don't give Klaus Schwab a ride.
[00:49:14.239 --> 00:49:16.801]  Don't give Prince Charles a ride.
[00:49:17.422 --> 00:49:20.024]  Don't give Barack Obama a ride.
[00:49:21.346 --> 00:49:22.627]  Or surely we will die.
[00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:29.634]  Here we are on this live Thursday global transmission into hour number two.
[00:49:31.138 --> 00:49:32.920]  I'm going to give the number up for first-time callers.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.601]  Give them a chance at the end of this segment.
[00:49:34.621 --> 00:49:37.343]  We'll take calls throughout the next two-plus hours.
[00:49:38.224 --> 00:49:42.347]  And then Paul Joseph Watson's going to be taking over for a spell.
[00:49:42.367 --> 00:49:49.413]  Okay, I want to hit the massive escalations that are unspeakably dangerous in Ukraine with Russia and NATO.
[00:49:49.433 --> 00:49:51.535]  I want to get into what's happening to the economy.
[00:49:51.575 --> 00:49:53.537]  More on CNN Plus after less than a month.
[00:49:54.017 --> 00:49:58.061]  Shuttering its arrogant, evil, lying, sociopathic doors.
[00:49:59.465 --> 00:50:04.932]  But first, this video got tens of millions of views in the last few days on Twitter, Instagram, or wherever else.
[00:50:05.833 --> 00:50:06.253]  You name it.
[00:50:07.174 --> 00:50:08.236]  So I thought we'd play it.
[00:50:09.317 --> 00:50:12.220]  See the hilarious reason Alex Jones was banned from Twitter.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.324]  And this is the head lawyer that broke down crying two days ago.
[00:50:15.344 --> 00:50:17.166]  Project Veritas caught her on tape.
[00:50:18.086 --> 00:50:24.069]  When she was talking to an all-hands meeting of executives about Elon Musk taking over.
[00:50:24.129 --> 00:50:32.172]  And this is why they claim I was banned for talking bad to Oliver Darcy when I saw him outside a congressional hearing in DC a few years ago.
[00:50:32.192 --> 00:50:33.513]  This is like four years ago now.
[00:50:34.973 --> 00:50:38.475]  It's a famous video where I say, this is the one that tries to censor people.
[00:50:38.495 --> 00:50:40.196]  This is the guy that says I'm bad and a racist.
[00:50:40.716 --> 00:50:41.876]  This is the guy that attacks me.
[00:50:41.896 --> 00:50:45.478]  And I said, amongst other things, that he looks like an evil possum.
[00:50:46.558 --> 00:50:47.379]  Try to have a little bit of fun.
[00:50:49.091 --> 00:50:51.492]  And of course he went and tattled and that was the final straw.
[00:50:51.532 --> 00:50:53.873]  You can't talk bad to public figures.
[00:50:54.053 --> 00:50:57.434]  They're only allowed to bully and dox you and censor and ban you.
[00:50:57.534 --> 00:50:59.495]  So here's a little mashup of that.
[00:50:59.515 --> 00:51:01.296]  Look at this right here.
[00:51:01.316 --> 00:51:06.478]  It's a guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's wrong.
[00:51:06.498 --> 00:51:08.239]  There's no censorship of conservatives or patriots.
[00:51:08.739 --> 00:51:10.639]  You are incredibly shameful.
[00:51:10.699 --> 00:51:11.600]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:12.880]  Eyes of the rat.
[00:51:16.222 --> 00:51:16.882]  Eyes of the rat.
[00:51:19.955 --> 00:51:20.676]  Eyes of the Rat.
[00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:24.301]  Eyes of the Rat.
[00:51:24.501 --> 00:51:25.923]  Even more evil looking person.
[00:51:25.983 --> 00:51:26.824]  He is just scum.
[00:51:26.884 --> 00:51:28.687]  You're a virus to America and freedom.
[00:51:28.827 --> 00:51:32.191]  Smelling like a possum that climbed out of the rear end of a dead cow.
[00:51:32.692 --> 00:51:35.997]  You look like a possum that got caught doing some really, really nasty stuff.
[00:51:37.455 --> 00:51:37.935]  That's enough!
[00:51:37.975 --> 00:51:38.255]  Really?
[00:51:38.135 --> 00:51:39.975]  He's an even more evil looking person.
[00:51:39.975 --> 00:51:40.974]  He's just scum.
[00:51:40.974 --> 00:51:41.974]  You're a virus to America and freedom.
[00:51:41.974 --> 00:51:45.974]   Smelling like a possum that climbed out of the rear end of a dead cow.
[00:51:45.974 --> 00:51:50.615]   You look like a possum that got caught doing some really, really nasty stuff.
[00:51:50.615 --> 00:51:55.014]  Caught doing some really, really nasty stuff.
[00:51:55.014 --> 00:51:58.895]  Caught doing some really, really nasty stuff.
[00:51:58.895 --> 00:52:04.535]  Caught doing some really, really nasty stuff.
[00:52:04.535 --> 00:52:05.535]  That's enough.
[00:52:05.535 --> 00:52:06.535]  Really?
[00:52:06.535 --> 00:52:07.535]  That's hilarious.
[00:52:07.535 --> 00:52:14.055]   Now all you people that have an inferiority complex and are thinking you can take the
[00:52:14.055 --> 00:52:16.975]   greatness of America and dominate it, that you might actually be somebody, because you
[00:52:16.975 --> 00:52:20.095]  project your own loathing for yourself on everybody else.
[00:52:20.095 --> 00:52:21.095]  I'm a winner.
[00:52:21.095 --> 00:52:22.095]  I love myself.
[00:52:22.095 --> 00:52:23.095]  I love who I come from.
[00:52:23.095 --> 00:52:24.975]  Victory and strength and honor.
[00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:27.655]  You are the definition of dishonor.
[00:52:27.655 --> 00:52:31.695]   And one day in the Encyclopedia Britannica, Encyclopedia Galactica, it will have your
[00:52:31.695 --> 00:52:33.935]  face next to dishonor and the word "rat."
[00:52:33.935 --> 00:52:35.055]  What do you hope to accomplish here?
[00:52:35.948 --> 00:52:45.134]  I'm just showing people just the servile nature of the bottom of the barrel that these dying news corporations have to dredge up from the front lines to attack the First Amendment.
[00:52:45.194 --> 00:52:51.217]  You're the equivalent of like the Hitler Youth being put on the front lines to stop the advance of the Allies.
[00:52:51.237 --> 00:52:53.018]  So you came here to attack the media?
[00:52:53.159 --> 00:52:54.239]  You're not the media.
[00:52:54.259 --> 00:52:55.120]  You are fake news.
[00:52:55.180 --> 00:52:56.881]  You are the criminal news network.
[00:52:57.061 --> 00:53:00.723]  You engage in racketeering trying to shut down real news, real information.
[00:53:00.543 --> 00:53:07.543]   He gives you a line of fraud in your audience on a premeditated continual basis.
[00:53:07.543 --> 00:53:14.543]  You got some damn evil eyes, son.
[00:53:14.543 --> 00:53:17.543]  You got some damn evil eyes, son.
[00:53:17.819 --> 00:53:25.304]  The video's on Bandod Video, but for any listeners that want to go see it or folks that want to share it, but notice he said, where are you going to publish this?
[00:53:26.345 --> 00:53:33.850]  Because it's already been taken off YouTube and Apple and Instagram and a bunch of other places.
[00:53:34.731 --> 00:53:37.393]  So he then went and ran, admittedly, and tattled to Twitter.
[00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:42.893]  Because how dare I stand up to somebody that's been attacking me for years and lying about me?
[00:53:43.534 --> 00:53:47.658]  How dare I resist him peacefully?
[00:53:49.639 --> 00:53:53.243]  That's where these people are, and that's where they come from.
[00:53:54.323 --> 00:53:54.924]  And that's what they do.
[00:53:54.964 --> 00:53:59.068]  But now, he was supposed to have his own show on CNN Plus with Brian Stelter.
[00:54:00.373 --> 00:54:06.254]  And now it's canceled after a month with $300 million investment because no one wants to watch you or listen to you.
[00:54:06.274 --> 00:54:11.335]  So just because you think you'd silence all your competition doesn't mean anybody would come.
[00:54:11.355 --> 00:54:21.098]  It'd be like if they canceled all the real NASCAR drivers, the top 100 drivers, and then brought people out there that had just gotten their driving license at 16 and didn't know how to drive.
[00:54:22.918 --> 00:54:25.139]  And then like, oh, we're going to go watch that at NASCAR.
[00:54:25.239 --> 00:54:26.759]  Let's go watch people who don't even know how to drive a car.
[00:54:28.971 --> 00:54:31.352]  I mean seriously, you think we're gonna show up and pay for that?
[00:54:32.293 --> 00:54:33.453]  Think anybody wants to listen to you?
[00:54:33.473 --> 00:54:40.257]  You think just because you come down on us with both feet, with the whole system, means you can still beat us?
[00:54:40.317 --> 00:54:55.493]   Because no, just like the United States under globalist control couldn't defeat the Vietnamese in a 15-year war, and I'm sorry a lot of our people got chewed up in that fraud, but it was a fraud, You will not beat us either.
[00:54:55.893 --> 00:54:56.954]  You New World Order scum.
[00:54:57.514 --> 00:55:13.785]  If we know you're an outside force, if we know you're here oppressing us, if we know you're here trying to dominate us, and we simply wake up to that fact, you will never prevail no matter what you do, and you are hated, and you are loathed mercenaries of the New World Order.
[00:55:14.065 --> 00:55:14.465]  Period.
[00:55:17.807 --> 00:55:18.688]  But that's what they fear.
[00:55:21.621 --> 00:55:24.302]  All right, let's hit the military news right now and the economy news.
[00:55:27.562 --> 00:55:38.105]  This is, I mean, it's hard to even be on air trying to get excited about this because I'm already super upset about it and there's not words to describe how upset I am.
[00:55:38.725 --> 00:55:40.086]  And I know you know it's dangerous too.
[00:55:41.006 --> 00:55:49.708]  It's just crazy that the West had a proxy war and overthrew the elected government eight years ago and attacked Russian held areas on their border and did all of this.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:55.581]  And finally lured Russia into this giant war that's going on.
[00:55:55.641 --> 00:55:56.261]  It's full-scale.
[00:55:56.301 --> 00:55:57.762]  I've talked to sources that just returned.
[00:55:58.842 --> 00:56:02.703]  It's unlike anything since World War II or Korea.
[00:56:03.843 --> 00:56:10.525]  It is just full-on battles and full-on house-to-house and just dead people everywhere on both sides.
[00:56:11.065 --> 00:56:18.687]  So a lot of Russians are dying, a lot of Ukrainians are dying, and a lot of Western personnel are dying as well.
[00:56:20.643 --> 00:56:22.765]  But there's such media control, you're not hearing about it.
[00:56:23.565 --> 00:56:24.486]  So it's bad.
[00:56:26.227 --> 00:56:28.769]  And I haven't been given all the details because that's classified.
[00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:40.398]  But I can tell you, the people over there say that the only group making any headway here is the New World Order with Divide and Conquer and a police state and massive weapons contracts.
[00:56:41.779 --> 00:56:43.500]  But it's a loser for everybody else involved.
[00:56:43.841 --> 00:56:50.031]   Putin came out and said we have weapons that no nation Has, and we will use them if needed.
[00:56:50.051 --> 00:57:00.338]  I already played the clip last hour, but I'm going to come back and I'm going to play that clip again to this stack of news, the deals with it, and what Biden has said, and then we're going right to your phone calls.
[00:57:00.398 --> 00:57:01.739]  But massive escalation.
[00:57:02.140 --> 00:57:05.903]  Biden's been sending $800 million, whatever that number, every week or so.
[00:57:05.963 --> 00:57:09.485]  Now it's $33 billion and a massive jump in funding.
[00:57:09.525 --> 00:57:10.146]  That's coming up.
[00:57:11.906 --> 00:57:16.069]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:57:16.629 --> 00:57:21.853]  Please, long-time callers, give new callers a chance, at least in the first round, so they can get on board.
[00:57:21.873 --> 00:57:23.474]  I want to talk to first-time callers at 877-789-2539.
[00:57:23.494 --> 00:57:23.614]  877-789-2539.
[00:57:23.634 --> 00:57:23.874]  877-789-Alex.
[00:57:23.994 --> 00:57:26.516]  And we will take your phone calls again on the other side.
[00:57:26.336 --> 00:57:31.936]  877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[00:57:31.936 --> 00:57:39.095]   And we will take your phone calls again on the other side, 877-789-2539.
[00:57:39.973 --> 00:57:40.774]  We are the resistance.
[00:57:40.874 --> 00:57:41.634]  You are the resistance.
[00:57:41.654 --> 00:57:42.095]  Stay with us.
[00:57:44.436 --> 00:57:48.678]  The United States is officially at war with Russia through NATO.
[00:57:50.174 --> 00:57:52.616]  Russia has openly made those statements on Monday.
[00:57:53.397 --> 00:57:55.598]  We didn't need Putin or Lavrov to tell us that.
[00:57:55.638 --> 00:57:58.781]  We know that this has all been set up by the globalists.
[00:57:58.801 --> 00:58:03.024]  This is terribly dangerous and is accelerating towards nuclear war.
[00:58:03.824 --> 00:58:09.969]  Lavrov said that we are getting very close to nuclear war as the West escalates weapons and training into Ukraine.
[00:58:10.449 --> 00:58:12.591]  And now Vladimir Putin said this today.
[00:58:15.453 --> 00:58:22.844]   If anyone Attempts to interfere in these events from the outside, they must know.
[00:58:23.644 --> 00:58:37.249]  And if they create threats, strategic threats to Russia that are unacceptable to us, they must realize that our response to their attacks will be swift.
[00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:45.872]  We will, we have all the instruments, all the weapons required to do so.
[00:58:46.544 --> 00:58:58.143]   We have weapons that no other nation has and we will use them if needed.
[00:58:58.143 --> 00:59:05.944]  Russia is a distraction.
[00:59:05.998 --> 00:59:15.505]  Ukraine is a diversion from the world economic collapse engineered by two years of lockdowns in the third world, often on lockdowns in Europe and other areas of the world.
[00:59:16.803 --> 00:59:25.585]  This is a global consolidation of power, the new global digital programmable token, cashless society, social credit score, carbon tax regime.
[00:59:25.605 --> 00:59:32.987]  It's not coming, it's being rolled out now, but they need the old system to go down while they pose as the saviors.
[00:59:33.647 --> 00:59:40.869]  That's why the globalists that are corporate, manipulating all the different sides against each other, are saying that power outages and cyber attacks are imminent.
[00:59:42.898 --> 00:59:48.083]  Meanwhile, Biden seeks $33 billion for Ukraine, a massive jump in funding.
[00:59:51.005 --> 00:59:54.108]  You hear that?
[00:59:54.128 --> 00:59:56.770]  $33 billion on top of the tens of billions just this year.
[00:59:59.012 --> 00:59:59.633]  But it gets worse.
[00:59:59.753 --> 01:00:05.818]  Biden wants new powers to seize Russian assets, and that means anybody they say is connected to a Russian.
[01:00:06.539 --> 01:00:08.621]  And I have been particularly targeted by those lies.
[01:00:09.892 --> 01:00:11.053]  When they have said it's U.S.
[01:00:11.073 --> 01:00:24.965]  government policy to fight Russians, and then when big banks cancel our bank accounts, one of them sent us the secret document out of G2 basically saying we're listed as Russians and as agents of evil.
[01:00:26.987 --> 01:00:34.393]  Meanwhile, Hunter Biden and his dad got three plus million dollars from the Moscow mayor, and it just goes on from there, but that's okay.
[01:00:36.598 --> 01:00:38.479]  Because, you know, Joe Biden's a pedophile, so it's okay, right?
[01:00:38.499 --> 01:00:39.099]  He's part of the club.
[01:00:39.939 --> 01:00:42.420]  Poland has secret plan for Ukraine, Moscow claims.
[01:00:43.021 --> 01:00:44.261]  It's not even Russia's claim.
[01:00:44.281 --> 01:00:45.462]  I don't just believe Moscow.
[01:00:45.482 --> 01:00:46.282]  They lie quite a bit.
[01:00:47.342 --> 01:00:53.225]  Poland's always said a bunch of areas on the border of Western Ukraine belong to them, and they're talking about taking it.
[01:00:53.245 --> 01:00:54.505]  That's what happens in wars.
[01:00:54.825 --> 01:00:55.886]  Countries get divided up.
[01:00:57.366 --> 01:01:00.788]  I predict Russia will take about a third of Eastern Ukraine.
[01:01:00.928 --> 01:01:03.889]  I predict Poland will take about 10% of Western Ukraine.
[01:01:05.197 --> 01:01:10.920]  Inability to quickly replace stingers and javelins for Ukraine highlights industrial base problems.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.562]  Air Force Mac reports that they are running out of weapons.
[01:01:14.582 --> 01:01:21.985]  That's what I was told by my military sources that were over there as journalists.
[01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:32.891]  And they see all the different foreign brigades that are coming in, including with military background, and there's no weapons for them.
[01:01:35.271 --> 01:01:38.112]  Iran outlines joint goals with China.
[01:01:39.832 --> 01:01:42.953]  So this has driven Iran and Russia and China closer together.
[01:01:44.374 --> 01:01:54.157]  Polish households are out of gas now, their main way of cooking food and heating and cooling their homes, as Russia turns off the gas, as they promised they would do.
[01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:54.217]  U.S.
[01:01:55.197 --> 01:01:59.879]  companies are in no rush to substitute Russian oil in Europe, despite Washington's promises.
[01:02:01.545 --> 01:02:08.788]  And again, Russia is the second largest supplier of fertilizer, one of the biggest suppliers of grain in the world, the third largest supplier of oil.
[01:02:08.928 --> 01:02:10.929]  I mean, this is going to hurt us, not them.
[01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:12.010]  The ruble's up.
[01:02:12.570 --> 01:02:13.270]  Fuel is up.
[01:02:13.351 --> 01:02:14.291]  Gas prices are up.
[01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:16.352]  Both natural gas and gasoline.
[01:02:17.012 --> 01:02:18.033]  Crude oil, all of it.
[01:02:18.893 --> 01:02:24.916]  Medovian president says, country in predicament since they have no alternatives to Russian gas.
[01:02:27.887 --> 01:02:31.269]  And it goes on from there.
[01:02:33.111 --> 01:02:39.075]  So a very, very, very dangerous situation that we are all in right now.
[01:02:39.095 --> 01:02:48.361]  I want to hit some more news on the economy, then we're going to break them back with our phone calls and other news and clips to balance out today's broadcast.
[01:02:49.782 --> 01:02:53.805]  Now, again, you saw the head of the IMF on Monday.
[01:02:55.966 --> 01:02:56.887]  We played a bunch of clips.
[01:02:58.934 --> 01:03:16.046]  Say, in English, in broken English, that they didn't know printing thousands of trillions of dollars in other currencies and then giving it to themselves at big corporations and banks to buy up everything would cause inflation.
[01:03:17.547 --> 01:03:27.894]  And they went on to say they need to slow the economy down by raising taxes on little people, the same thing Chuckie Schumer said, which of course is the exact opposite you do during an inflationary period.
[01:03:30.854 --> 01:03:45.135]  If you want to bankrupt somebody, cut their pay, which is what taxes do, while prices go up, while the rich elites give themselves trillions of dollars a week to buy up whatever they want.
[01:03:47.987 --> 01:03:48.608]  Recession.
[01:03:49.128 --> 01:03:49.468]  U.S.
[01:03:49.568 --> 01:03:55.393]  GDP shockingly contracts in Q1 driven by inventory exports plunge.
[01:03:56.034 --> 01:03:57.395]  So our exports are even down.
[01:03:57.455 --> 01:03:58.736]  We can't get stuff out of China.
[01:03:59.276 --> 01:04:01.538]  There's no supply chain to speak of.
[01:04:01.658 --> 01:04:02.639]  Everything's falling apart.
[01:04:02.699 --> 01:04:03.540]  I can tell you that.
[01:04:04.401 --> 01:04:09.385]  And the average American still doesn't get the fact that we've gone over the edge of a cliff.
[01:04:11.446 --> 01:04:11.687]  U.S.
[01:04:11.727 --> 01:04:13.588]  goods trade deficit hits record high.
[01:04:13.688 --> 01:04:15.710]  Q1 GDP growth estimates slashed.
[01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:16.631]  Reuters.
[01:04:18.738 --> 01:04:18.819]  U.S.
[01:04:18.839 --> 01:04:20.945]  economy post-surprise contraction.
[01:04:21.045 --> 01:04:23.050]  Oh, it's so surprise.
[01:04:23.792 --> 01:04:24.354]  But don't worry.
[01:04:26.084 --> 01:04:38.247]  All over the world, Western leaders say the answer is cutting off more pipelines, more oil, more gas, more natural gas, and more solar, even though solar, it takes more carbon to make a windmill than it ever produces in electricity.
[01:04:38.827 --> 01:04:52.190]  And the average idiot thinks, oh, an electric car is environmental, it doesn't use any fossil fuel, even though most of the power it gets is from coal, and they're shutting those down, and windmills and hydroelectric cannot supply enough for even a fraction of what we have, 10%.
[01:04:52.250 --> 01:04:52.791]  Can we get 10%?
[01:04:57.637 --> 01:05:02.323]  But then Hollywood says we can't have nuclear either, which I have issues with because they don't run them right, but that's, I mean, what are we gonna do?
[01:05:03.464 --> 01:05:04.265]  You see, what's that mean?
[01:05:04.926 --> 01:05:07.028]  Boxed in, no energy, being shut down.
[01:05:08.334 --> 01:05:10.174]  A mostly wind and solar-powered U.S.
[01:05:10.194 --> 01:05:11.955]  economy is a dangerous fantasy.
[01:05:12.395 --> 01:05:13.995]  Well, it's not a fantasy for the globalists.
[01:05:14.015 --> 01:05:18.036]  It's a post-industrial world shutting down civilization and society from depopulation.
[01:05:18.076 --> 01:05:23.757]  But yes, people that buy into it who don't know what's going on, they are living in fantasy land.
[01:05:24.257 --> 01:05:27.218]  South Korea agrees to share gas with Europe amid energy crisis.
[01:05:27.598 --> 01:05:29.038]  Oh, so they're going to sell more gas.
[01:05:29.058 --> 01:05:30.138]  They're going to produce more gas.
[01:05:30.998 --> 01:05:34.639]  But here we can't even do it because Biden's putting all these regulations and rules on, so you can't.
[01:05:35.458 --> 01:05:43.162]  But don't worry, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia and Russia and South Korea, they can all supply everybody now.
[01:05:44.023 --> 01:05:51.467]  As America goes from being the biggest energy exporter to now the biggest energy importer again.
[01:05:51.867 --> 01:05:54.788]  In four years, Trump reversed that for the second time in U.S.
[01:05:54.828 --> 01:05:55.129]  history.
[01:05:55.509 --> 01:05:56.809]  And now they've done it again.
[01:05:56.950 --> 01:06:03.173]  Screwed us over because the public is economically illiterate about how things really work.
[01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:15.429]  All right, we're gonna come back with your phone calls, and then I'm gonna get into the pedophile news that is unbelievable, and more on the Media Wars, Twitter, and so much more today.
[01:06:15.469 --> 01:06:18.473]  We've got a big broadcast lined up for you.
[01:06:18.493 --> 01:06:21.235]  We've also got border news and Hollywood blood drinking.
[01:06:21.756 --> 01:06:24.218]  It's a big, hot thing they're doing, and it's a ritual thing.
[01:06:24.238 --> 01:06:25.039]  You know, Satan loves them.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:25.940]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:26.321]  Stay with us.
[01:06:27.811 --> 01:06:28.432]  All right, we're back.
[01:06:28.472 --> 01:06:32.895]  We're about to go to your phone calls here on this live Thursday, April 28th transmission.
[01:06:33.856 --> 01:06:35.997]  And something interesting happened.
[01:06:37.238 --> 01:06:43.323]  I love the crew and they don't steal stuff, but there are a few things around here that come up missing sometimes.
[01:06:44.204 --> 01:06:48.727]  And that's the little Faraday cages when we leave them laying around and it's Survival Shield X2.
[01:06:48.787 --> 01:06:54.632]  Now this is my personal bottle that I keep right here at my desk and I was about to illustrate for you.
[01:06:57.403 --> 01:07:00.084]  Taking some, but it was already, it was half full a few weeks ago.
[01:07:00.604 --> 01:07:02.805]  Someone has been eating my porridge.
[01:07:03.825 --> 01:07:08.927]  Someone has been taking my X2, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:08.947 --> 01:07:11.387]  So let me see if there's even any left in this bottle.
[01:07:11.948 --> 01:07:14.188]  And the answer is no, literally.
[01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:15.269]  I didn't mean to do this picture.
[01:07:15.429 --> 01:07:17.870]  Someone has stolen directly out of my bottle.
[01:07:18.650 --> 01:07:20.530]  And we had like 10 bottles a month ago here.
[01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:21.271]  Have we found one yet?
[01:07:22.211 --> 01:07:23.271]  And they've all disappeared.
[01:07:23.371 --> 01:07:24.832]  So someone is taking the X2.
[01:07:26.826 --> 01:07:33.930]  And I'm not mad, but I'm literally about to plug X2 and take it, and my X2 bottle was over there on the other counter, and it disappeared.
[01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:34.550]  It's okay.
[01:07:35.050 --> 01:07:37.411]  Just get somebody to bring more from the warehouse, okay?
[01:07:37.451 --> 01:07:38.932]  And then we will lock it up.
[01:07:39.072 --> 01:07:41.313]  I love the crew, and I'm sure they didn't do it.
[01:07:41.393 --> 01:07:48.497]  I think gremlins come in here at night, little elves come in here at night, but my point is, you know what else comes up missing around here?
[01:07:49.437 --> 01:07:50.538]  Because this stuff's all over the place.
[01:07:51.753 --> 01:07:52.654]  Super Metal Vitality.
[01:07:53.394 --> 01:08:01.000]  And when I forget to take Super Metal Vitality, in fact, our head of security, I was in his office the other week, and I go, I notice you've got some Super Metal Vitality there on your counter.
[01:08:01.821 --> 01:08:02.722]  Did you buy that?
[01:08:02.902 --> 01:08:04.403]  Well, somebody gave it to me.
[01:08:04.863 --> 01:08:05.604]  Have you been liking it?
[01:08:05.844 --> 01:08:07.105]  Oh, yeah, I've been liking it.
[01:08:07.125 --> 01:08:07.986]  He's in really good shape.
[01:08:08.026 --> 01:08:10.208]  And everything else, did you catch the libido?
[01:08:10.228 --> 01:08:11.389]  He's like, yeah, it's amazing.
[01:08:12.449 --> 01:08:13.350]  They're great products.
[01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:16.292]  They're available at m4workstore.com.
[01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:17.794]  And I was sitting here during the break.
[01:08:18.953 --> 01:08:20.373]  I was thinking, I need to take some X2.
[01:08:20.473 --> 01:08:21.514]  I haven't taken it in about a week.
[01:08:22.754 --> 01:08:26.395]  And I found my bottle over there in the other office, and someone took it.
[01:08:26.415 --> 01:08:30.036]  You're not supposed to take that much in a couple weeks, so I want to know what's going on.
[01:08:31.076 --> 01:08:35.557]  My point is, is that X2 is deep-earth crystal iodine.
[01:08:36.077 --> 01:08:38.978]  Billions of people have cognitive disabilities looking up for iodine deficiency.
[01:08:38.998 --> 01:08:43.879]  Most iodine in the soil and the food is bound to other elements, so you don't absorb it correctly or any of it.
[01:08:44.879 --> 01:08:45.359]  It's amazing.
[01:08:45.379 --> 01:08:46.279]  It's been sold out for months.
[01:08:46.339 --> 01:08:47.100]  It's back in stock, 25% off.
[01:08:49.858 --> 01:08:50.719]  You take it under the tongue.
[01:08:50.739 --> 01:08:53.000]  I like to just put it in water and drink it that way.
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.602]  And when you take the X2, bring it to me.
[01:08:56.682 --> 01:08:57.442]  Oh, you found something.
[01:08:57.462 --> 01:08:58.003]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:08:58.463 --> 01:09:02.545]  When you take the X2, I'm just going to be completely point-blank with you.
[01:09:03.186 --> 01:09:06.728]  It was Dr. Group 10 years ago told me, Alex, most people are iodine deficient.
[01:09:07.188 --> 01:09:08.109]  And I said, what do you think?
[01:09:08.129 --> 01:09:09.269]  The story goes, no, that's toxic.
[01:09:09.289 --> 01:09:13.031]  He goes, he developed some that was extracted out of seaweed.
[01:09:13.051 --> 01:09:13.271]  That was X1.
[01:09:14.112 --> 01:09:16.112]  It was still really good but not deep earth crystal.
[01:09:16.112 --> 01:09:18.112]  Then we lost that source because of who I was.
[01:09:18.112 --> 01:09:21.112]  So we got it from an oil and gas drilling company.
[01:09:21.112 --> 01:09:23.112]  You have to have a DA license to have it.
[01:09:23.112 --> 01:09:25.112]   It's a controlled substance before it's put into the palm oil.
[01:09:25.112 --> 01:09:31.112]   And he said, "Wait about two weeks. You'll go through the detox and feel bad for about a week."
[01:09:31.817 --> 01:09:34.798]  And then you'll just feel incredible after those sunspots you have will go away.
[01:09:35.218 --> 01:09:36.879]  You're going to notice a lot more.
[01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:38.119]  Let's just be technical.
[01:09:38.179 --> 01:09:38.979]  It's not, it's not funny.
[01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:43.021]  You will notice a larger morning erection, probably like when you were a teenager.
[01:09:43.041 --> 01:09:43.781]  And I'm like, sure.
[01:09:43.841 --> 01:09:43.961]  Right.
[01:09:43.981 --> 01:09:44.621]  He goes, listen to me.
[01:09:45.441 --> 01:09:48.742]  He goes, take it, promote it, sell it.
[01:09:48.762 --> 01:09:50.083]  So I private labeled his brand then.
[01:09:51.007 --> 01:09:54.108]  And ladies and gentlemen, two weeks later, felt sick for a couple days.
[01:09:54.248 --> 01:09:58.989]  After that, I like it when I'm carrying my children up a hill and on your shoulders.
[01:09:59.009 --> 01:10:03.590]  And when you take them off, you feel like you're flying because the 50, 60 pounds, whatever it is, is off your shoulders.
[01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:06.030]  It's the same thing when I forget to take X2.
[01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:08.711]  It's just such a game changer.
[01:10:09.231 --> 01:10:19.735]   And yes, when I remember to take X2 at least a couple times a week, I have libido like when I was 18 years old, and that's not what it's even sold for.
[01:10:20.336 --> 01:10:22.298]  That's an example of what it does.
[01:10:22.358 --> 01:10:33.167]  So listen, just like I don't steer you wrong on politics or geopolitical systems of the world, or two years ago, hey, better buy storable food, food prices are going to explode, there's going to be shortages, now it's happening.
[01:10:33.447 --> 01:10:34.768]  This is all very simple stuff.
[01:10:34.808 --> 01:10:35.349]  It's science.
[01:10:35.989 --> 01:10:36.570]  It's economy.
[01:10:37.591 --> 01:10:50.743]  This X2 is so incredibly important, and I finally started setting an alarm on my phone every two days that goes off to remind me to take it, because when I do, I lose weight, I'm healthy, and again, my libido is absolutely incredible.
[01:10:50.804 --> 01:10:53.306]  I mean, I don't want to get technical here, but let's just say this.
[01:10:53.826 --> 01:10:55.608]  It's like I'm 18, but better.
[01:10:56.229 --> 01:11:00.573]  And where was iodine of this quality my whole life?
[01:11:00.613 --> 01:11:01.173]  The answer is...
[01:11:02.233 --> 01:11:07.844]  They put bromine and bromide and chlorine and everything and fluoride, the opposite of it, to block those natural activities.
[01:11:08.205 --> 01:11:10.168]  This stuff is dragon juice, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:15.264]  How did I forget to take that for over a week?
[01:11:15.944 --> 01:11:23.348]  So, ladies and gentlemen, X2 is 25% off at infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:11:23.368 --> 01:11:30.772]  And seriously, I don't know who's doing it, I love you guys, and I trust you with my life, but just, I'll buy you your own bottle.
[01:11:30.972 --> 01:11:39.236]  Stop pilfering the Super Mel Vitality and the Pollen Block, that one too, and my X2.
[01:11:39.336 --> 01:11:40.057]  Get your own.
[01:11:41.127 --> 01:11:42.409]  Get your own X2.
[01:11:43.210 --> 01:11:44.471]  Get your own Turbo Force.
[01:11:44.511 --> 01:11:45.533]  Get your own Brain Force.
[01:11:45.553 --> 01:11:46.814]  Get your own Brain Force Ultra.
[01:11:47.836 --> 01:11:49.578]  Hey, but I'm proud of that.
[01:11:49.938 --> 01:11:50.799]  The fact that...
[01:11:53.328 --> 01:11:54.589]  I mean, humans, we act like monkeys.
[01:11:54.749 --> 01:11:58.471]  I mean, we see something and we, you know, I mean, even I will steal a grape at the grocery store.
[01:11:58.491 --> 01:11:59.371]  So I'm not blaming the crew.
[01:11:59.391 --> 01:12:00.792]  You know, a grape or strawberry looks good.
[01:12:00.832 --> 01:12:03.453]  You're like, I'm already spending a lot of money at this grocery store.
[01:12:03.473 --> 01:12:06.614]  Kind of look around and you're like, that cherry looks good.
[01:12:06.935 --> 01:12:08.035]  I should have watched this.
[01:12:08.055 --> 01:12:08.755]  I don't want a cherry.
[01:12:09.196 --> 01:12:11.537]  You're like spitting the cherry pit out the trash can at the grocery store.
[01:12:12.557 --> 01:12:15.779]  I took my daughter to the grocery store about a week and a half ago and I stole a grape.
[01:12:15.879 --> 01:12:16.959]  I stole a strawberry.
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:18.540]  Look, I'm being a hypocrite here.
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.982]  The point is, is that these are available right now.
[01:12:24.016 --> 01:12:28.560]  And I hope you get your X2 because it's something everybody should do.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.762]  You are crazy if you don't do this.
[01:12:31.802 --> 01:12:41.610]  The globalists are working around the clock to make sure you don't get this essential, pure element into your bloodstream and into your cells.
[01:12:41.630 --> 01:12:42.311]  I'm going to stop there.
[01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:45.193]  And I promise I'm not going to belabor any more plugging.
[01:12:46.694 --> 01:12:47.295]  Even next hour.
[01:12:47.315 --> 01:12:48.756]  I'm going to behave myself and control myself.
[01:12:48.776 --> 01:12:49.496]  We've got to find ourselves.
[01:12:50.037 --> 01:12:52.199]  Matthew, Don, Noah, Marshall.
[01:12:53.707 --> 01:13:05.770]  Al, Daniel, Dave, Jeremy, and Anna, we will get to all these calls and more in the next hour and 21 minutes, starting when we come back in a few minutes.
[01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:07.170]  I've still got more time before we go to break.
[01:13:07.570 --> 01:13:17.413]  I want to go ahead and hit this story, and then we will go to break, and we'll come back, this group of stories, we'll come back with your phone calls on the other side directly.
[01:13:18.646 --> 01:13:19.307]  Look at this headline.
[01:13:19.327 --> 01:13:20.327]  In fact, get the clip ready, please.
[01:13:20.708 --> 01:13:26.813]  Biden just made a comment about parental rights that's even worse than the previous comments we've seen.
[01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:31.758]  We also have the MSNBC clip from one of their hosts years ago.
[01:13:33.572 --> 01:13:38.132]  comes out and says that your children belong to us.
[01:13:38.132 --> 01:13:39.652]  Melissa Harris Perry.
[01:13:39.652 --> 01:13:44.490]   We have to break through this idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families.
[01:13:44.490 --> 01:13:46.212]  We're going to play her clip first.
[01:13:46.212 --> 01:13:49.091]   Then we're going to play Biden's clip from yesterday evening.
[01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:53.251]  And then we're going to hit this other article.
[01:13:53.418 --> 01:13:55.299]  Look at this article out of Red State.
[01:13:55.379 --> 01:13:56.760]  I follow the links.
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:57.720]  It's true.
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.261]  We already know this is going on.
[01:13:59.281 --> 01:14:18.308]  The Department of Education is coordinating with 20-plus Democrat-controlled legislatures to begin sexualization of children at age 5 on a, quote, pleasure-based sexual relation model designed to end the family so people don't ever make lasting bonds and instead never form families.
[01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:26.999]   So whether it's homosexual or heterosexual, I am telling you, this is pedophilia, and you see it everywhere, and it's all out in the open.
[01:14:27.019 --> 01:14:29.200]  Again, we trailblazed exposing that, it sounded crazy.
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:33.341]  That's why they were so pissed at us, because they knew their plan was about to roll out, we had their documents.
[01:14:33.682 --> 01:14:36.543]  They didn't want people to be pre-warned to be ready for it when it came out.
[01:14:37.323 --> 01:14:42.385]  Democrat legislators want children taught sex, specifically pleasure-based sexual relations.
[01:14:42.925 --> 01:14:49.248]  We'll get to that when we come back from your calls, but right now, let's go to MSNBC saying your children belong to them.
[01:14:50.119 --> 01:14:55.878]   We have never invested as much in public education as we should have because we've always had kind of a private
[01:14:55.878 --> 01:14:56.838]  notion of children.
[01:14:56.838 --> 01:15:00.339]  Your kid is yours and totally your responsibility.
[01:15:00.339 --> 01:15:03.839]   We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children.
[01:15:03.839 --> 01:15:08.978]   So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids
[01:15:08.978 --> 01:15:12.079]   belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[01:15:12.079 --> 01:15:17.879]   Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
[01:15:17.879 --> 01:15:21.879]  You've heard me say it many times about our children.
[01:15:21.837 --> 01:15:22.477]  But it's true.
[01:15:22.497 --> 01:15:24.139]  They're all our children.
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:28.484]  And the reason you're the teachers of the year is because you recognize that.
[01:15:29.486 --> 01:15:30.587]  They're not somebody else's children.
[01:15:30.607 --> 01:15:32.209]  They're like yours when they're in the classroom.
[01:15:34.079 --> 01:15:35.279]  What a creepy bastard.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.080]  We'll go to break and come back with your phone calls.
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:40.582]  And you know, I made the joke about stealing strawberries and cherries.
[01:15:41.142 --> 01:15:44.443]  Actually, I bought a bag of strawberries and cherries, or boxes of strawberries and cherries.
[01:15:44.483 --> 01:15:45.283]  I guess I didn't technically.
[01:15:45.724 --> 01:15:49.585]  They even, at Central Market, where we went, have a little table when you first come in for free stuff for the kids.
[01:15:49.985 --> 01:15:51.506]  So we both got free apples.
[01:15:51.546 --> 01:15:54.367]  But I guess it was only for kids, so I did technically steal an apple.
[01:15:54.887 --> 01:15:55.147]  Okay.
[01:15:55.627 --> 01:15:56.408]  My mind worked through it.
[01:15:56.428 --> 01:15:57.248]  Like, you didn't actually steal that.
[01:15:57.288 --> 01:15:57.828]  You bought those.
[01:15:57.868 --> 01:15:58.569]  Well, it doesn't matter.
[01:15:58.589 --> 01:15:59.389]  I did steal an apple.
[01:16:00.029 --> 01:16:00.950]  So I'm correct now.
[01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:01.490]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:03.951]  That's right, I can't submit to tyranny.
[01:16:05.552 --> 01:16:06.913]  Free Bird, baby!
[01:16:07.774 --> 01:16:08.234]  Woo!
[01:16:09.515 --> 01:16:16.400]  You know, that's what Leonard Skinner is, is hillbilly music.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.201]  Crank it back up for me.
[01:16:19.703 --> 01:16:20.463]  Taking it to the next level.
[01:16:20.483 --> 01:16:29.390]  I've heard recordings of some of my mother's great-uncles, some of the first recordings in like the 20s of hillbillies in East Texas.
[01:16:30.663 --> 01:16:31.883]  There's a band of 10 people.
[01:16:31.923 --> 01:16:33.044]  Like, I got the CD somewhere.
[01:16:33.104 --> 01:16:33.964]  They transferred the CD.
[01:16:34.004 --> 01:16:34.624]  We got to play it here.
[01:16:34.944 --> 01:16:36.165]  And it sounds just like this.
[01:16:36.505 --> 01:16:37.685]  Just the recording isn't as good.
[01:16:38.025 --> 01:16:41.246]  And it's just like a crescendo, like angels playing.
[01:16:43.167 --> 01:16:47.848]  And you hear all these banjos and fiddles with guitars all at the same time.
[01:16:48.088 --> 01:16:51.649]  And then it just raises to a crescendo, like at the end of Freebird.
[01:16:52.849 --> 01:16:55.050]  It's so hard to turn it off.
[01:16:56.766 --> 01:16:57.387]  It's amazing.
[01:16:57.787 --> 01:17:03.412]  This part's just the build-up at the start, but the end, where it just, that cacophony, you can imagine what heaven's gonna be like.
[01:17:03.733 --> 01:17:06.275]  Music a trillion times more powerful played by the angels.
[01:17:09.938 --> 01:17:10.379]  Amazing.
[01:17:15.003 --> 01:17:17.766]  In fact, maybe we should just cue it up to the end of the song, because it's so powerful.
[01:17:20.024 --> 01:17:21.825]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[01:17:21.845 --> 01:17:23.466]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:17:23.486 --> 01:17:25.587]  We're going right to your phone calls.
[01:17:25.607 --> 01:17:29.929]  And then I got Megan Fox, which was trending on Twitter saying Alex Jones is right.
[01:17:30.509 --> 01:17:35.332]  Last few days, I didn't get to it yesterday, but she's up there talking about rituals and drinking blood.
[01:17:37.453 --> 01:17:39.114]  I mean, you talk about a narcissistic.
[01:17:40.953 --> 01:17:43.553]  Marina Baranovic, wannabe type person.
[01:17:44.494 --> 01:17:49.735]  This type of bizarre behavior is just par for the course inside Hollywood.
[01:17:49.755 --> 01:17:50.715]  That's why they're collapsing.
[01:17:51.635 --> 01:17:53.815]  That's coming up next hour.
[01:17:53.855 --> 01:17:54.856]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:17:54.896 --> 01:18:01.217]  We got Matthew and Don and Noah and Marshall and Al and Daniel and Dave and Jeremy and Anna and others.
[01:18:01.737 --> 01:18:03.237]  We'll go in the order the calls are received.
[01:18:03.877 --> 01:18:06.758]  Let's go ahead and talk to Matthew in California.
[01:18:06.798 --> 01:18:07.078]  Go ahead.
[01:18:09.468 --> 01:18:10.509]  Hey Alex, good talking to you.
[01:18:10.529 --> 01:18:10.929]  Yes sir.
[01:18:10.949 --> 01:18:13.371]  I just sent you the Illuminati trading card.
[01:18:14.232 --> 01:18:16.533]  Listen, you should start going to UFC fights.
[01:18:16.553 --> 01:18:20.136]  Those events are high profile, they're good publicity and a great way to spread your message.
[01:18:20.536 --> 01:18:25.340]  I train at a pro MMA gym here in Sacramento and all the fighters love you and none of them are taking the back.
[01:18:26.789 --> 01:18:27.230]  No, I know.
[01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:30.631]  I mean, I used to, a long time ago when I had time, I went to a lot of UFC fights with Joe Rogan.
[01:18:31.091 --> 01:18:39.795]  He'd get me front row tickets, and I was hanging out with Joe last night, and former heavyweight contender, and it was real interesting.
[01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:45.138]  In fact, that's all they basically talked about was the vaccine and the tyranny and the New World Order, and you're right.
[01:18:45.918 --> 01:18:47.539]  The UFC is super awake.
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:52.622]  They're awake, that whole community is awake, and they would love to see you at those events.
[01:18:52.642 --> 01:18:53.922]  They'll put you up on the big screen.
[01:18:54.402 --> 01:18:55.483]  Trust me, you should go to those.
[01:18:56.625 --> 01:18:58.648]  And, uh, thank you for everything that you do.
[01:18:58.668 --> 01:19:03.013]  This is my first time calling in, and I've been a, I don't know, a 15-year listener.
[01:19:03.613 --> 01:19:09.180]  But, uh, before I go, I just wanted to plug, I won't steal your X2, but don't leave your bodies out, or I'm gonna take that.
[01:19:09.801 --> 01:19:17.405]  I'm a court reporter, and after a long day of work, my hands really, really hurt, and that stuff really helps me recover and helps me keep fighting the New World Order.
[01:19:18.005 --> 01:19:19.866]  Well, court reporters are incredible.
[01:19:20.286 --> 01:19:21.527]  How fast your hands move.
[01:19:21.547 --> 01:19:23.748]  Yeah, and of course, bodies is the ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:19:24.108 --> 01:19:25.849]  Strongest humanoid any factory's made.
[01:19:25.869 --> 01:19:27.470]  95% humanoid.
[01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:28.790]  The average turmeric has 5%.
[01:19:28.830 --> 01:19:29.531]  Still works well.
[01:19:29.911 --> 01:19:31.271]  My wife would take these horse pill ones.
[01:19:31.652 --> 01:19:35.233]  She plays a lot of tennis and lifts a lot of weights, and they would help her a little.
[01:19:35.273 --> 01:19:36.694]  She says, well, how does yours help?
[01:19:36.713 --> 01:19:38.713]  help better than ones that are way stronger.
[01:19:38.713 --> 01:19:39.713]  And I said, "Is there normal tumor?"
[01:19:39.713 --> 01:19:40.713]  This is a concentrate.
[01:19:40.713 --> 01:19:42.713]  So, thank you so much for the support, brother.
[01:19:42.713 --> 01:19:44.713]  I really, really appreciate you.
[01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:45.713]  God bless.
[01:19:45.713 --> 01:19:51.713]   Yeah, I, uh, not name-dropping, but I mean, Joe, I was out with Joe last night.
[01:19:51.713 --> 01:19:55.713]   He had a bunch of UFC people with him and was like, "I don't really follow UFC much.
[01:19:56.660 --> 01:19:57.820]  I'm like, wow, this guy looks tough.
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.622]  They go, yeah, he's the former number one, number two contender.
[01:20:00.642 --> 01:20:05.044]  I'm like, I gotta mess with you.
[01:20:05.944 --> 01:20:07.265]  And they were all just totally awake.
[01:20:07.425 --> 01:20:07.905]  So, yeah.
[01:20:08.145 --> 01:20:10.746]  And I know a lot of the UFC people are listeners.
[01:20:10.766 --> 01:20:11.727]  They do shout outs at it.
[01:20:12.127 --> 01:20:13.347]  And, you know, we really should go to that.
[01:20:15.089 --> 01:20:16.229]  It would be a good PR stunt.
[01:20:16.269 --> 01:20:17.490]  I can also do a lot of podcasts.
[01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:19.450]  So yeah, I should go to UFC fights.
[01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:21.170]  I should be a part of that.
[01:20:21.190 --> 01:20:22.651]  I should.
[01:20:23.391 --> 01:20:27.032]  And Joe quit inviting me years ago just because I get so busy I can't go.
[01:20:27.052 --> 01:20:31.033]  Like the last time I went was like six, seven years ago when he was in Houston.
[01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:35.774]  But we're gonna definitely get involved in that because it's a lot of great people and Dana White's a great guy.
[01:20:36.374 --> 01:20:38.254]  Okay, who's up next here?
[01:20:38.475 --> 01:20:39.255]  That would be...
[01:20:42.225 --> 01:20:43.506]  Marshall in Alaska.
[01:20:43.526 --> 01:20:44.587]  Marshall, thank you for calling.
[01:20:44.607 --> 01:20:44.967]  Go ahead.
[01:20:46.828 --> 01:20:51.331]  Good morning, Alex, from the greatest state, the Alaskan, the last frontier.
[01:20:51.392 --> 01:20:52.772]  It's an honor to be with you.
[01:20:52.792 --> 01:20:58.837]  I do want to add that you're right about the nasodiodine and the super male vitality.
[01:20:59.017 --> 01:20:59.837]  Those are amazing.
[01:21:00.118 --> 01:21:01.839]  I also love the vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:21:02.677 --> 01:21:05.282]  And that new one, the ImmunoSupport, the ImmuneSupport.
[01:21:06.143 --> 01:21:07.085]  Phenomenal products.
[01:21:07.105 --> 01:21:07.506]  Thank you.
[01:21:07.526 --> 01:21:10.250]  I appreciate you buying those and giving them out to us.
[01:21:10.350 --> 01:21:11.532]  I appreciate you keeping me on air, brother.
[01:21:11.573 --> 01:21:12.254]  Please don't thank me.
[01:21:12.294 --> 01:21:12.614]  Thank you.
[01:21:13.513 --> 01:21:14.974]  Well, I love the product.
[01:21:15.034 --> 01:21:23.336]  Anyway, I just want to, you know, maybe let some of the new listeners know that there are a lot of ways that we can, you know, push back against this on a peaceful manner.
[01:21:23.817 --> 01:21:29.777]   And the only way I can really describe this is, like basically what I have done with the assistance
[01:21:29.777 --> 01:21:33.976]   of some friends and some groups, is that we basically get into the ears
[01:21:33.976 --> 01:21:38.576]   of some of our local state legislatures and get them information,
[01:21:38.576 --> 01:21:43.256]   whether it's pulled from your website or it's pulled from other great websites
[01:21:43.256 --> 01:21:45.216]  and just lay out the facts.
[01:21:45.216 --> 01:21:46.777]  And it's been proven worthy.
[01:21:46.777 --> 01:21:53.777]   Basically, if we can influence the right people, like for example, you saw the governor of Alaska
[01:21:53.777 --> 01:21:57.817]   a few weeks ago, he's thinking about drilling in on Alaska state lands
[01:21:57.817 --> 01:21:59.496]  because of the federal bans.
[01:21:59.496 --> 01:22:02.136]   And so just those little things, just reaching out to people,
[01:22:02.136 --> 01:22:04.296]  even waking up people, you don't know who.
[01:22:04.511 --> 01:22:05.031]  Like, who else?
[01:22:05.231 --> 01:22:07.373]  Other people know, and they might pass that information along.
[01:22:07.453 --> 01:22:07.953]  Absolutely.
[01:22:08.053 --> 01:22:09.634]  I can tell you, we've seen the studies.
[01:22:09.694 --> 01:22:11.615]  The caribou sleep up against the pipelines.
[01:22:12.396 --> 01:22:14.337]  The humans build settlements and grow trees.
[01:22:14.797 --> 01:22:16.518]  It's nothing but frozen tundra out there.
[01:22:16.538 --> 01:22:20.561]  And oil and gas is an extremely clean process now.
[01:22:21.081 --> 01:22:24.265]  Other than some fracking in some water tables that isn't good.
[01:22:24.285 --> 01:22:26.388]  So the oil company doesn't do a good job.
[01:22:26.428 --> 01:22:27.429]  They can cause some problems.
[01:22:27.469 --> 01:22:30.112]  But we should absolutely be exploring Alaska.
[01:22:30.573 --> 01:22:34.978]  And Trump opened it up and Biden killed it just like he killed the Keystone Pipeline and so much more.
[01:22:34.998 --> 01:22:36.179]  And that's why we're going bankrupt.
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:38.542]  And so we've got to get in there.
[01:22:38.562 --> 01:22:45.045]   And as you know, you live up there, but I've looked at the topographical maps. I mean, what, like 95% of Alaska's not
[01:22:45.045 --> 01:22:49.484]   even sparsely populated? It's totally empty? So the idea that doing some limited oil
[01:22:49.484 --> 01:22:55.635]   drilling and gas drilling is bad is just preposterous. Well, Alex, too, Alaska has some of the cleanest
[01:22:55.635 --> 01:23:02.525]   drilling laws on the books, and there's several pipelines only being used at something like
[01:23:02.525 --> 01:23:03.923]  30 to 50 percent.
[01:23:04.117 --> 01:23:07.359]  So we definitely have the capability to get it to ships and get it to the lower 48.
[01:23:07.719 --> 01:23:11.262]  Exactly, but the caribou and everybody, as you know, like cover.
[01:23:11.602 --> 01:23:12.803]  And there's no cover out there.
[01:23:13.223 --> 01:23:20.227]  And now we know that their population has gone up in certain areas just because the pipelines were built that are now being shut off because they sleep up against them.
[01:23:20.327 --> 01:23:21.108]  It gives them cover.
[01:23:21.128 --> 01:23:26.191]  I mean, it's like seeking an old battleship in the Caribbean.
[01:23:26.231 --> 01:23:27.612]  You'd say, oh, that's going to hurt things.
[01:23:27.652 --> 01:23:28.893]  No, it creates a giant reef.
[01:23:29.793 --> 01:23:31.954]  Human development is good when it's done right.
[01:23:32.214 --> 01:23:34.454]  We need to develop this country.
[01:23:36.295 --> 01:23:42.057]  I completely agree, and I will support any effort to help develop and help everybody else out.
[01:23:42.397 --> 01:23:48.078]  This is all about helping out our citizens, helping out everybody, and Alex, thank you for having me on.
[01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:48.998]  God bless you.
[01:23:49.038 --> 01:23:56.080]  I pray for you every day, and I wish you the best, and I'm going to continue to pray for you as you are under tremendous attack.
[01:23:58.473 --> 01:23:59.894]  I pray for you Alex.
[01:24:00.094 --> 01:24:23.231]   I need the prayer Marshall that I am under massive attack but I know anytime I feel sorry for myself that that means we're all under attack and I asked for this and I stepped up to the plate and you've stepped to the plate and all I ask is you stay with me and you realize how serious these times are for all of us when you look at Jones and you see I'm under attack you're under attack they're coming after all of us and you're not next they're already attacking you Thank you, sir.
[01:24:23.811 --> 01:24:26.672]  Let's talk to Daniel in North Carolina.
[01:24:27.112 --> 01:24:28.632]  Sorry, my eyes are going out.
[01:24:28.972 --> 01:24:30.173]  Daniel in North Carolina, go ahead.
[01:24:31.553 --> 01:24:32.073]  Hey, Alex.
[01:24:32.293 --> 01:24:33.513]  How are you doing today?
[01:24:33.813 --> 01:24:35.093]  Man, I'm good talking to you, brother.
[01:24:35.254 --> 01:24:35.514]  Love you.
[01:24:35.534 --> 01:24:35.854]  What's up?
[01:24:37.354 --> 01:24:37.894]  Well, good.
[01:24:38.094 --> 01:24:39.834]  I think I have a few ideas here.
[01:24:40.215 --> 01:24:45.035]  Assuming we can stop the NWO takeover, Technocratic Police State.
[01:24:47.076 --> 01:24:51.817]  We're still looking at a population drop-off if this mRNA is like all the other ones.
[01:24:53.564 --> 01:24:55.686]  Somewhere between 80 to 100, possibly.
[01:24:55.706 --> 01:24:57.347]  Fatalities.
[01:24:58.568 --> 01:25:05.394]  So what I'm thinking is, we've got to get the wildlife to bounce back and get nature itself back on course a little bit.
[01:25:05.714 --> 01:25:11.138]  Maybe planting fruit-bearing trees and shrubs wildly, and of course people plant their own produce locally.
[01:25:11.158 --> 01:25:25.685]   Oh yeah, if we just use rooftops in Germany, grow food in the medians of the highways, we'll have so much... Look, the government pays farmers not to plant The United States can supply the whole world with food, brother.
[01:25:26.787 --> 01:25:29.452]  The idea that we've reached our carrying capacity is a lie.
[01:25:30.640 --> 01:25:39.663]  And I'm also suggesting that we start eating gators and sharks and large aquatic predators to get those populations to bounce back as well.
[01:25:39.883 --> 01:25:46.345]  De-salinization, even people running their own personal stills, but large town stills near the coast and lakes and whatnot.
[01:25:46.445 --> 01:25:46.965]  It'd be fun.
[01:25:47.005 --> 01:25:48.106]  We could run on bonfires.
[01:25:48.426 --> 01:25:51.166]  Well sure, there's no doubt there's been some overfishing and things like that.
[01:25:52.007 --> 01:25:54.988]  But, you know, it's like Biden said, there's no more trees.
[01:25:55.048 --> 01:25:58.669]  We have more trees than when white men arrived 400 years ago in the United States.
[01:25:59.485 --> 01:26:00.526]  I mean, there's more trees now.
[01:26:00.606 --> 01:26:01.366]  We've planted more trees.
[01:26:01.386 --> 01:26:02.387]  There's more trees than ever been.
[01:26:03.387 --> 01:26:03.648]  All right.
[01:26:04.068 --> 01:26:05.509]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:08.230]  Infowars.com is the tip of the spear.
[01:26:08.290 --> 01:26:11.212]  Only way the dog hunts is you share the link, and I want to thank you all for doing it.
[01:26:11.472 --> 01:26:13.213]  We are in a war together for freedom.
[01:26:13.554 --> 01:26:15.953]  Hour number three and your call is two minutes away.
[01:26:15.953 --> 01:26:21.953]  [Music]
[01:26:21.953 --> 01:26:25.953]  [Music]
[01:26:25.953 --> 01:26:51.953]  [Music]
[01:26:51.953 --> 01:26:53.953]  Don't look for it.
[01:26:54.105 --> 01:26:55.226]  Be happy with what you got.
[01:26:56.367 --> 01:26:59.430]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[01:26:59.970 --> 01:27:01.611]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[01:27:02.032 --> 01:27:03.093]  The real owners.
[01:27:03.153 --> 01:27:07.677]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[01:27:08.057 --> 01:27:09.298]  Forget the politicians.
[01:27:09.518 --> 01:27:12.801]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:14.763]  You don't.
[01:27:15.575 --> 01:27:16.556]  You have no choice.
[01:27:16.936 --> 01:27:17.857]  You have owners.
[01:27:18.157 --> 01:27:19.218]  They own you.
[01:27:20.439 --> 01:27:21.740]  They own everything.
[01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:23.642]  They own all the important land.
[01:27:23.982 --> 01:27:25.724]  They own and control the corporations.
[01:27:25.764 --> 01:27:29.226]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls.
[01:27:29.247 --> 01:27:30.828]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[01:27:31.148 --> 01:27:35.992]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[01:27:36.152 --> 01:27:37.794]  They got you by the balls.
[01:27:39.267 --> 01:27:41.328]  They want obedient workers.
[01:27:41.748 --> 01:27:43.309]  Obedient workers.
[01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:56.316]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[01:27:56.376 --> 01:28:02.720]  And now, they're coming for your social security money, so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[01:28:04.179 --> 01:28:07.120]  It's a big club, and you ain't in it.
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:12.461]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[01:28:12.781 --> 01:28:13.661]  You better believe it.
[01:28:13.761 --> 01:28:15.662]  So what specifically did they do?
[01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:21.243]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage, I've given to, just so you understand.
[01:28:21.263 --> 01:28:22.083]  A lot of money.
[01:28:22.704 --> 01:28:25.424]  You and I are not in the big club.
[01:28:25.764 --> 01:28:27.705]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:32.046]  It's called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[01:28:33.473 --> 01:28:34.954]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[01:28:35.334 --> 01:28:38.817]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[01:28:38.837 --> 01:28:42.759]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:43.740]  They're not interested in that.
[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:44.961]  That doesn't help them.
[01:28:45.341 --> 01:28:46.722]  That's against their interest.
[01:28:47.223 --> 01:28:47.663]  That's right.
[01:28:47.703 --> 01:28:54.703]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:28:55.703 --> 01:29:04.703]  [Applause]
[01:29:04.703 --> 01:29:07.703]  We are drugged out!
[01:29:08.341 --> 01:29:10.630]  We are following other people's opinions!
[01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:13.982]  We are controlled by the media.
[01:29:14.562 --> 01:29:16.103]  Today, it all changes.
[01:29:16.423 --> 01:29:18.924]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[01:29:18.944 --> 01:29:22.045]  It is a choice, just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[01:29:22.266 --> 01:29:26.787]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result.
[01:29:27.008 --> 01:29:29.509]  So we keep on saying, I hate you, I hate you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[01:29:29.549 --> 01:29:32.190]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[01:29:32.350 --> 01:29:34.451]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:29:34.931 --> 01:29:36.312]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:29:36.332 --> 01:29:37.432]  We have the resources.
[01:29:41.391 --> 01:29:44.612]  Because you need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[01:29:44.652 --> 01:29:45.933]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[01:29:46.133 --> 01:29:47.713]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[01:29:47.733 --> 01:29:48.614]  They say Trump's crazy.
[01:29:48.814 --> 01:29:49.714]  They say I'm crazy.
[01:29:49.894 --> 01:29:52.095]  But I'm here to show love.
[01:29:52.275 --> 01:29:55.916]  It's a bigger plan and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[01:29:57.497 --> 01:30:00.978]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:30:01.358 --> 01:30:03.358]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:30:03.358 --> 01:30:10.877]  I want them shut down.
[01:30:10.928 --> 01:30:11.868]  I want them silenced.
[01:30:11.888 --> 01:30:12.689]  I want them muted.
[01:30:12.729 --> 01:30:14.590]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:15.850]  Banning people.
[01:30:16.070 --> 01:30:20.773]  They're dictating the opinions that everyone on the platform is allowed to have.
[01:30:21.033 --> 01:30:29.237]  I'm a conservative Jew, so I guess that makes me such a dangerous person.
[01:30:32.099 --> 01:30:32.899]  Spreading articles.
[01:30:32.939 --> 01:30:33.739]  Spreading videos.
[01:30:33.759 --> 01:30:34.280]  Spreading links.
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.100]  You're gonna get demonized.
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:36.561]  You're gonna get attacked.
[01:30:39.386 --> 01:30:42.627]  It's going to do something terrible like help Trump get re-elected.
[01:30:42.647 --> 01:30:46.268]  That's really what all this is about.
[01:30:46.328 --> 01:30:50.210]  They say that they deem our content and our brand unsafe.
[01:30:50.490 --> 01:30:57.112]  It is the right to be, do, and say whatever you want.
[01:30:57.152 --> 01:31:00.973]  It's about freedom of expression.
[01:31:00.993 --> 01:31:05.695]  I'm a journalist and the left's not interested in telling the truth about me because I don't fit the stereotype.
[01:31:08.186 --> 01:31:09.410]  They can say whatever they think.
[01:31:09.511 --> 01:31:11.598]  I respect their constitutional right to do it.
[01:31:11.418 --> 01:31:13.418]  I hope they respect my cut.
[01:31:13.418 --> 01:31:28.418]  [Music]
[01:31:28.418 --> 01:31:35.418]   What M4 does, if you are receiving this transmission, is chronicle all this forbidden information.
[01:31:35.418 --> 01:31:38.418]  We're a reservoir, a library of it.
[01:31:38.418 --> 01:31:41.418]   It must be protected at all cost. We salute you and thank you.
[01:31:41.418 --> 01:31:43.418]  We'll be right back and go to Hollywood Blood Drinking.
[01:31:43.418 --> 01:31:45.418]  Your phone call is straight ahead.
[01:31:45.418 --> 01:31:50.418]  Remember, my friends, God is in control.
[01:31:51.209 --> 01:32:03.854]  And that's why those that have served evil and turned their souls over to destruction fight so hard to get us to degradate ourselves and our children, because only then will we roll over and accept two plus two equals a hundred.
[01:32:04.554 --> 01:32:11.637]  Only then will we accept all the lies they're trying to push on us and the unnatural world these evil people are trying to build.
[01:32:11.657 --> 01:32:16.759]  We'll go right back to your phone calls, but I mentioned this yesterday, but I wanted to cover it today.
[01:32:17.679 --> 01:32:19.320]  This is Megan Fox.
[01:32:20.698 --> 01:32:27.423]  And this is her talking about her and her boyfriend and how they drink each other's blood.
[01:32:28.384 --> 01:32:30.085]  And then she makes a big joke out of it.
[01:32:30.385 --> 01:32:33.387]  But that's what Angelina Jolie does.
[01:32:33.407 --> 01:32:34.788]  A bunch of them do it on record.
[01:32:34.988 --> 01:32:37.350]  It's standard operating procedure.
[01:32:37.369 --> 01:32:42.828]   know I was hanging out with Joe Rogan last night for a couple hours and he
[01:32:42.828 --> 01:32:46.250]   asked me said how did you know about Jeffrey Epstein 15 plus years ago and
[01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:51.849]   tell me about it he said how'd you know that I said Ted Gunderson was tapped to
[01:32:51.849 --> 01:32:55.649]   be the FBI director but he was old school so he didn't get it but he was
[01:32:55.649 --> 01:33:00.649]   the head of the FBI in Memphis and the head in LA and here is and he did some
[01:33:00.649 --> 01:33:05.130]   things that were bad he ran the COINTELPRO program against black folks
[01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:07.231]  He later apologized to that on the air before he died.
[01:33:08.032 --> 01:33:09.092]  But he thought they were comments.
[01:33:09.112 --> 01:33:09.992]  He thought it was the right thing to do.
[01:33:10.012 --> 01:33:11.613]  But later he saw that he was wrong.
[01:33:12.113 --> 01:33:14.795]  Martin Luther King and the Black Panthers and others he targeted.
[01:33:15.415 --> 01:33:16.215]  But he was the real deal.
[01:33:17.036 --> 01:33:19.497]  And, you know, I knew he was real.
[01:33:20.177 --> 01:33:23.919]  And I got a chance to interview him probably 60 times, 70 times.
[01:33:24.679 --> 01:33:26.860]  Had a chance to have dinner with him probably 10 times.
[01:33:27.621 --> 01:33:29.061]  He would come and give speeches in Austin.
[01:33:29.281 --> 01:33:30.282]  And he took time out.
[01:33:30.922 --> 01:33:35.886]  To really try to educate me and would call me on the phone and ask how I was doing and tell me he appreciated me.
[01:33:35.906 --> 01:33:40.310]  You know, Charlton Heston did that when I was, I mean, we're talking like in 1999, 98.
[01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:44.974]  I mean, I was just, hey, it's Charlton Heston.
[01:33:44.994 --> 01:33:45.555]  It's Chuck here.
[01:33:45.615 --> 01:33:46.335]  Please give me a call.
[01:33:46.355 --> 01:33:47.737]  He said, how are you doing?
[01:33:47.757 --> 01:33:48.297]  You're really doing it.
[01:33:48.437 --> 01:33:49.618]  But he wasn't just doing that to me.
[01:33:50.199 --> 01:33:52.941]  He was doing hundreds of interviews a month on talk radio.
[01:33:53.381 --> 01:33:57.525]  He was flying all around in his own jet with his own money, pissing his liberal wife off.
[01:33:59.685 --> 01:34:01.546]  Educate people about the Second Amendment in America.
[01:34:01.606 --> 01:34:02.547]  He really loved it.
[01:34:03.167 --> 01:34:05.489]  And I would have like 15-minute conversations only.
[01:34:05.529 --> 01:34:06.670]  It probably happened five, six times.
[01:34:07.931 --> 01:34:08.991]  With Charlton Heston.
[01:34:09.852 --> 01:34:11.553]  And the first time I interviewed him, I interviewed him twice.
[01:34:12.974 --> 01:34:16.656]  He said, hey, feel free to call me if you ever want to talk about strategy.
[01:34:17.477 --> 01:34:18.938]  So I didn't call, didn't call.
[01:34:18.978 --> 01:34:20.859]  Next time I had him on, he said, hey, you never called.
[01:34:20.919 --> 01:34:22.680]  So I called once, didn't answer.
[01:34:23.781 --> 01:34:25.022]  Called again, didn't answer.
[01:34:25.682 --> 01:34:26.383]  Called again.
[01:34:27.083 --> 01:34:28.785]  Hello, this is Chuck.
[01:34:29.721 --> 01:34:35.908]  I'm like, Mr. Heston, because, you know, I wouldn't care about some modern holiday person, but he was a Christian, a patriot.
[01:34:36.089 --> 01:34:38.351]  I mean, hell, the Ten Commandments, you name it, been heard.
[01:34:38.491 --> 01:34:39.733]  I mean, my God, I grew up on that.
[01:34:40.113 --> 01:34:46.261]  And I'm like, he would just it was like these incredible speeches, but very calmly.
[01:34:47.819 --> 01:34:54.903]  America is in trouble, and we've got important work to do, and it's gonna be young men like you that are gonna help lead the future after people like me are gone, Alex.
[01:34:55.463 --> 01:35:15.135]  And you've got a particular gift for what you do, and I just, you know, and I'm sitting there, and it was General Parton, and I even had more conversations with him than Gunderson, and only a few with Heston, five or six, but the point was is these guys were the real deal.
[01:35:16.730 --> 01:35:22.794]  And John Wayne, I never got to talk to John Wayne or anybody, met his son, but the point was is that John Wayne did the same stuff.
[01:35:24.375 --> 01:35:29.899]  John Wayne tirelessly ran around defending America, tirelessly encouraging the troops and common people.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.181]  That's real leadership, folks.
[01:35:32.781 --> 01:35:34.582]  And not when the cameras were on, everybody was around.
[01:35:34.642 --> 01:35:36.724]  They really understood leadership.
[01:35:37.782 --> 01:35:48.612]  So I'm sitting there with Joe Rogan last night, and he's got his friends there, and he's saying, I said, Joe, please stop, because he went on for like 20 minutes, like, Alex said this, and Alex said that, and I'm like, Joe, please.
[01:35:48.872 --> 01:35:51.795]  I said, I know about this from Ted Gunderson and General Parton.
[01:35:51.915 --> 01:35:53.576]  I mean, that's how I know all this stuff.
[01:35:57.912 --> 01:36:00.755]  You know, then I said Charlton Heston and people are looking at me like, Charlton Heston?
[01:36:00.815 --> 01:36:04.139]  I mean, it just gets weirder and weirder and weirder.
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.781]  But truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:36:05.801 --> 01:36:08.885]  And that's what I'm saying to everybody is, you're just as important as I am.
[01:36:08.925 --> 01:36:10.046]  Matt Drudge always said that.
[01:36:10.086 --> 01:36:13.811]  That a person with a blog or a website is just as important as the New York Times.
[01:36:13.831 --> 01:36:16.394]  You're a person, you're observing, you're reporting what you're seeing.
[01:36:16.414 --> 01:36:17.135]  Doesn't mean you're perfect.
[01:36:18.698 --> 01:36:21.039]  And so I'm giving credit to Charlton Heston.
[01:36:21.379 --> 01:36:26.021]  And by the way, I know that Ted Gunderson's son reached out like a year ago, and we never got him on.
[01:36:26.481 --> 01:36:29.422]  I want Ted Gunderson's son on.
[01:36:29.442 --> 01:36:33.684]  I only talked to him on the phone like one time, 20-something years ago.
[01:36:34.884 --> 01:36:36.365]  I want Ted Gunderson's son on.
[01:36:36.665 --> 01:36:37.485]  I want to fly him here.
[01:36:38.446 --> 01:36:40.307]  Because every day I think about Ted Gunderson.
[01:36:40.487 --> 01:36:41.907]  Every day I think about Benton Parton.
[01:36:42.067 --> 01:36:43.548]  Every day I think about Charlton Heston.
[01:36:45.114 --> 01:36:45.754]  Trailblazers.
[01:36:45.855 --> 01:36:47.376]  Every day I think about Barry Goldwater.
[01:36:48.056 --> 01:36:50.618]  Every day I think about Congressman Hanson.
[01:36:51.838 --> 01:36:59.884]  Every day I think about the John Birch Society and the people that were dead on, that nobody was basically listening to, and that they were demons.
[01:36:59.904 --> 01:37:01.705]  I mean, even Ronald Reagan woke up by these folks.
[01:37:02.105 --> 01:37:07.401]   I mean, he was perfect, but he was woken up by Heston and Goldwater.
[01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:08.502]  He wrote that.
[01:37:08.542 --> 01:37:08.962]  He said that.
[01:37:08.982 --> 01:37:09.543]  He gave speeches.
[01:37:10.103 --> 01:37:10.984]  They're highly suppressed.
[01:37:11.024 --> 01:37:12.585]  We should go find those speeches.
[01:37:12.645 --> 01:37:13.066]  I've seen them.
[01:37:13.086 --> 01:37:16.629]  And then play the Reagan speeches when he was running for office in 79-80.
[01:37:16.749 --> 01:37:22.233]  Because you listen to it and it sounds like Alex Jones, just a lot smoother.
[01:37:22.333 --> 01:37:24.355]  But that's what America was facing.
[01:37:24.475 --> 01:37:29.199]  They knew this stuff when I was 6, 7, 8, 9 years old.
[01:37:31.701 --> 01:37:32.442]  We're gonna go to your calls.
[01:37:32.462 --> 01:37:33.102]  I want you to know.
[01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:49.899]  This isn't our first rodeo, and we wouldn't even be where we are today without these men and women, like Charlotte Iserby, and Anthony Sutton, and just so many other amazing people.
[01:37:50.139 --> 01:37:50.900]  Phyllis Schlafly.
[01:37:52.332 --> 01:37:56.094]  These were good, hard-working Americans.
[01:37:56.294 --> 01:37:57.095]  Salt of the Earth.
[01:37:57.475 --> 01:37:58.516]  Classy, good people.
[01:37:59.116 --> 01:38:01.057]  The FBI today was like Ted Gunnarson.
[01:38:01.097 --> 01:38:02.858]  I talked to him about January 6th in a minute.
[01:38:03.139 --> 01:38:05.660]  They weren't perfect, but they were really, on average, trying to do good.
[01:38:06.201 --> 01:38:08.302]  They got misguided sometimes, but they were good people.
[01:38:09.162 --> 01:38:21.350]  Today, ladies and gentlemen, it's run by people like Robert Mueller, who cut his teeth with Whitey Bulger, running murder operations and drug operations in the East Coast.
[01:38:23.274 --> 01:38:30.496]  And that's when things really started getting bad was in the 70s, 80s and 90s, when the FBI got infiltrated by the mafia, and basically became the mafia.
[01:38:31.537 --> 01:38:34.078]  And that's where we are today.
[01:38:34.218 --> 01:38:42.000]  So I'm sitting there talking to Joe and all these great people.
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:53.816]   And it's like I'm speaking in Chinese or Martian, Ted Gunderson, General Parton, Ron Paul came out of those guys.
[01:38:55.438 --> 01:38:56.960]  I'm going to go to break and take your calls, I promise.
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:57.420]  I'm sorry.
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:38:58.261]  I'm just ranting here.
[01:38:58.962 --> 01:39:07.211]  But just imagine Gunderson saying they run child kidnapping rings to black motorbikes and take kids to private islands and Jeffrey Epstein and all this stuff.
[01:39:07.251 --> 01:39:08.773]  And we're talking like 20 years ago.
[01:39:10.626 --> 01:39:11.747]  So that's how I knew all this.
[01:39:12.587 --> 01:39:22.674]  Because the very heart of America, what we used to be, hardcore, dedicated men and women that would tell the truth no matter what, that did their research and were tireless.
[01:39:23.315 --> 01:39:25.136]  That's what M4 Wars was built on.
[01:39:27.097 --> 01:39:32.641]  And I'm just blown away that their discernment, that they spent so much time believing in me.
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:35.401]  And I believe in you.
[01:39:36.061 --> 01:39:38.783]  That's why when you call in and thank me, we're all in this together, folks.
[01:39:38.843 --> 01:39:39.303]  I love you.
[01:39:39.884 --> 01:39:40.624]  I appreciate you.
[01:39:41.985 --> 01:39:43.566]  Well, what do you expect me not to fight these people?
[01:39:44.707 --> 01:39:45.367]  It's a default.
[01:39:45.447 --> 01:39:46.068]  Don't thank me.
[01:39:46.328 --> 01:39:47.008]  Just help me fight.
[01:39:47.468 --> 01:39:55.474]  Here is Megan Fox just sitting around how wonderful blood is and how she drinks it with her boyfriend.
[01:39:55.494 --> 01:39:55.814]  Here it is.
[01:39:56.955 --> 01:40:12.363]   I guess to drink each other's blood might Mislead people are like people are imagining us with like goblets and we're like Game of Thrones drinking each other's blood It's just a few drops, but yes, we do consume each other's blood on occasion for ritual purposes
[01:40:13.170 --> 01:40:19.889]   Only it is used for a reason and it is controlled where it's like let's shed a few drops of blood
[01:40:19.889 --> 01:40:24.649]   I need to drink it. He's much more haphazard and hectic and chaotic where he's willing to just like
[01:40:24.649 --> 01:40:28.409]   Cut his chest open with broken glass and be like take my soul
[01:40:28.409 --> 01:40:36.139]   It doesn't not happen Let me tell you maybe not exactly like that, but it a
[01:40:36.139 --> 01:40:44.750]   version of that has happened and many times So an empty but beautiful woman introducing everybody to
[01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:51.187]   vampirism Young girls are watching this, and this is like a worm on a hook dropped in the water.
[01:40:51.747 --> 01:41:03.074]  Here's a beautiful, radiant woman, all lit up perfectly, sticking her breasts out like, so that men and women and young girls think that's what beauty is, is bleeding and cutting and harming yourself.
[01:41:03.334 --> 01:41:03.835]  Vampirism.
[01:41:05.029 --> 01:41:05.830]  And then we got this.
[01:41:06.370 --> 01:41:13.156]  Hitting a new low, Ukrainian man posts video boasting of eating Russian soldiers' flesh on camera as a vampire.
[01:41:13.636 --> 01:41:15.237]  That's on Infowars.com.
[01:41:15.998 --> 01:41:16.959]  That's what we're fighting, folks.
[01:41:16.979 --> 01:41:18.060]  We'll be back with your phone calls.
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:18.620]  Stay with us.
[01:41:20.001 --> 01:41:20.842]  Infowars.
[01:41:22.343 --> 01:41:24.685]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:41:26.026 --> 01:41:29.029]  And being aware of that is half the battle.
[01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:32.512]  Alright, we're gonna go to your phone calls right now.
[01:41:33.686 --> 01:41:35.308]  Those of you that have been patiently holding.
[01:41:37.170 --> 01:41:40.873]  Let's talk to Jeremy and then Don and others.
[01:41:41.394 --> 01:41:43.456]  Jeremy in Nevada, you're on the air, my friend.
[01:41:44.597 --> 01:41:45.258]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:41:45.979 --> 01:41:55.648]  Yeah, I've been a longtime listener, first-time caller, and I'm a bartender down here in Las Vegas, so I promote your show and your products constantly all the time.
[01:41:55.668 --> 01:41:55.989]  Thank you.
[01:41:56.863 --> 01:42:03.792]  It's a pleasant surprise that I find there's a lot more people like ourselves that, you know, are waking up to what's going on.
[01:42:04.533 --> 01:42:13.784]  But at the same time, I'm telling people all the time out there at the bar that, you know, when it boils down to this election, you know, I've been telling people, be wary.
[01:42:13.844 --> 01:42:20.648]   They've got to do something to You know, make it to where they cheat again for election fraud, so on and so forth.
[01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:27.638]  And so I've been telling people that I think that there's going to be some sort of new virus because a lot of people aren't believing in Corona now and all the rest of the stuff.
[01:42:28.218 --> 01:42:28.759]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:28.779 --> 01:42:28.919]  Yeah.
[01:42:28.939 --> 01:42:33.426]  They already punched us with a straight right and now they're about to hit us with a left hook.
[01:42:34.512 --> 01:42:55.760]  And so, I just saw an article yesterday talking about how out of China there's a new avian flu that was just confirmed with a case, but saying that, oh, it's relatively impossible for, you know, it to spread to humans, but it sounds oddly familiar to what they did with Corona, and it's coming out right at the right time.
[01:42:55.780 --> 01:43:01.122]  It's totally pre-programmed, and if they think they can get away with it, they're going to drop the hammer on us, brother.
[01:43:01.142 --> 01:43:01.782]  What do you think we should do?
[01:43:03.246 --> 01:43:13.874]  I honestly have been trying to tell people that, you know, if you're not taking some of your stuff and some other supplements to keep your immune systems high, I mean, you're running a risk.
[01:43:14.174 --> 01:43:16.436]  Make sure you stay away from the dang vaccines.
[01:43:17.528 --> 01:43:18.949]  And, you know, eat healthy.
[01:43:19.149 --> 01:43:23.371]  I mean, the biggest thing is if we keep our immune systems up, they can target us all day long.
[01:43:23.411 --> 01:43:34.616]  But as long as we ain't taking their poison shots and all that other stuff and stop wearing the dang mask, I think that's what we need to be aware of and not do the voting like that.
[01:43:35.137 --> 01:43:41.580]  I literally, if they start trying to get us to do the mail voting stuff, no, we need to stand against that.
[01:43:42.446 --> 01:43:43.066]  I agree, sir.
[01:43:43.086 --> 01:43:44.246]  Thank you so much for calling.
[01:43:44.686 --> 01:43:46.347]  Let's go to a caller in Idaho.
[01:43:46.467 --> 01:43:48.507]  Let's talk to Don in Idaho.
[01:43:51.108 --> 01:43:51.528]  Hey, Alex.
[01:43:51.568 --> 01:43:54.769]  Thanks for the reminder for the Dragon Juice.
[01:43:54.829 --> 01:44:01.570]  I just had some after you initially talked about the X2, but man, I think we're living through a script.
[01:44:01.610 --> 01:44:03.510]  This is just insane.
[01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:09.572]  Everything that's going on from the GEN21 to what's going on over in Ukraine.
[01:44:09.892 --> 01:44:20.178]   There's a great Yeah, well, it just goes through all the different ways that they can overextend Russia, you know, and the probability of success in all these different categories.
[01:44:20.198 --> 01:44:21.399]  It's a great article.
[01:44:21.219 --> 01:44:25.219]   which they're carrying out there. Tell people more about that document.
[01:44:25.219 --> 01:44:30.219]   Yeah, well it just goes through all the different ways that they can overextend Russia, you know,
[01:44:30.219 --> 01:44:35.219]   and the probability of success in all these different categories. It's a great article.
[01:44:35.219 --> 01:44:38.219]  They've got all kinds of charts on here.
[01:44:38.219 --> 01:44:42.219]   I've scanned the document years ago and then looked at it again last month.
[01:44:41.913 --> 01:44:44.694]  Give people the name again so we can put it on screen for TV viewers.
[01:44:45.554 --> 01:44:49.916]  Yeah, it's Overextending and Unbalancing Russia.
[01:44:50.176 --> 01:44:52.397]  Overextending and Unbalancing Russia, RAND.
[01:44:52.437 --> 01:44:52.857]  There it is.
[01:44:55.293 --> 01:44:56.273]  Yeah, it's a really good read.
[01:44:56.333 --> 01:44:59.014]  I highly suggest it.
[01:44:59.054 --> 01:45:00.234]  We're just living through that now.
[01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:02.235]  You can see all the tactics that are laid out.
[01:45:02.275 --> 01:45:02.735]  And that's it.
[01:45:02.755 --> 01:45:05.215]  They're scripting a doomsday into the world.
[01:45:05.295 --> 01:45:06.155]  It's humans' fault.
[01:45:06.215 --> 01:45:07.156]  Global warming lie.
[01:45:07.196 --> 01:45:14.357]  When they're the ones collapsing civilization and intend to maintain control and build city-states, everything else will be collapsed and feudalism.
[01:45:14.477 --> 01:45:15.597]  That is the plan.
[01:45:15.917 --> 01:45:16.818]  And we know their plan.
[01:45:16.838 --> 01:45:18.198]  It should be easy to stop, folks.
[01:45:20.140 --> 01:45:22.842]  That's right, and I just wanted to say a couple quick things.
[01:45:23.043 --> 01:45:24.504]  I've been a listener since about 07.
[01:45:24.824 --> 01:45:29.288]  I heard you on Alan Watt, God rest his soul, the old Cutting Through the Matrix host.
[01:45:29.688 --> 01:45:30.589]  Yeah, he was a great guy.
[01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:31.050]  Amazing.
[01:45:31.850 --> 01:45:49.986]   Yeah, and then I remember years ago, G. Edward Griffin said, talking to you, He was talking about his Freedom Force International thing that he had started years ago, but basically he said we can't do anything without positions of power and influence.
[01:45:52.327 --> 01:45:54.208]  We're just on our heels constantly, right?
[01:45:55.276 --> 01:45:56.616]  You know, I don't see too many pictures of that.
[01:45:56.656 --> 01:46:00.958]  And let me pause you and interrupt, because if I try to name all the great people, I can't, but G.E.B.R.
[01:46:00.978 --> 01:46:03.078]  Griffin has been around since the 60s.
[01:46:03.118 --> 01:46:15.642]  He was an extremely successful corporate executive, learned about all this, heard of John Byrne's society record, didn't believe it, went to disprove it, found that it was true, and just did so much of the work today.
[01:46:16.082 --> 01:46:16.423]  G.E.B.R.
[01:46:16.443 --> 01:46:17.483]  Griffin is a living legend.
[01:46:17.603 --> 01:46:23.005]  I want him on the show immediately, because I want to honor these people, and he is still alive and still healthy.
[01:46:23.065 --> 01:46:24.205]  What an incredible individual.
[01:46:25.572 --> 01:46:27.373]  In fact, I salute G. Edward Griffin.
[01:46:28.153 --> 01:46:31.194]  I salute him as good as it gets.
[01:46:31.594 --> 01:46:33.414]  Probably the greatest living American right now.
[01:46:33.754 --> 01:46:35.395]  We salute you, G. Edward Griffin.
[01:46:35.535 --> 01:46:36.635]  What a dynamo.
[01:46:37.836 --> 01:46:40.196]  Dozens of huge films that millions watched.
[01:46:40.656 --> 01:46:42.877]  First huge documentaries in the 60s and 70s.
[01:46:43.037 --> 01:46:45.998]  I mean, he literally launched so much of the resistance now.
[01:46:46.298 --> 01:46:47.398]  How did I not think of him?
[01:46:47.738 --> 01:46:49.239]  My God, another one of my mentors.
[01:46:50.512 --> 01:46:52.072]  Yeah, he's an amazing, amazing man.
[01:46:52.092 --> 01:46:58.955]  And I just want to finish by saying, you know, we're ruled by irresponsible children that can't be accountable for their actions.
[01:46:59.875 --> 01:47:02.776]  And every day, it seems I learn they're more evil than the day before.
[01:47:02.796 --> 01:47:03.936]  That's all I got.
[01:47:03.956 --> 01:47:07.437]  Well, I hate to travel, and Jim McGriffin invited me to so many of his events, I never went to them.
[01:47:07.457 --> 01:47:09.378]  But, God, I should have.
[01:47:09.738 --> 01:47:10.038]  Absolutely.
[01:47:10.058 --> 01:47:11.158]  What else is on your mind there, Don?
[01:47:13.319 --> 01:47:13.979]  That's about it.
[01:47:13.999 --> 01:47:16.500]  Just every day I learn they're more evil than the day before.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:19.981]  So we just got to keep fighting, keep yourself healthy.
[01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:21.950]  Educate yourself.
[01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:22.651]  That's right.
[01:47:22.671 --> 01:47:26.052]  They have no bottom and it's our acquiescence that allows them to do it.
[01:47:26.092 --> 01:47:26.472]  Thank you.
[01:47:27.292 --> 01:47:35.575]  Again, I'm just thinking about all the persecution I've been through and it's a blessing because I get to know G. Edward Griffin and General Parton and Ted Gunderson.
[01:47:36.175 --> 01:47:43.978]  And then now I get to influence Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan and Victor Orban and Bolsonaro.
[01:47:44.018 --> 01:47:44.819]  And it's not bragging.
[01:47:44.839 --> 01:47:45.299]  It's true.
[01:47:45.359 --> 01:47:48.480]  It's like how literally and I appreciate your call.
[01:47:49.713 --> 01:47:55.278]  I'd be at dinner with General Partin or Ted Gunnarsson, and they'd just give him a speech.
[01:47:56.039 --> 01:47:57.300]  And I'd be at a table with about 10 people.
[01:47:59.942 --> 01:48:01.464]  And they'd be like, I want to talk to you for a minute.
[01:48:01.764 --> 01:48:05.683]   Or he'd walk over with a car and he was like, Both of them did stuff like this that'll grab you.
[01:48:05.723 --> 01:48:07.385]  Listen, this is really serious.
[01:48:07.845 --> 01:48:09.466]  You got to get really serious and be focused.
[01:48:09.506 --> 01:48:10.807]  Understand what we're on target here.
[01:48:11.168 --> 01:48:12.269]  And we're not going to be around forever.
[01:48:12.289 --> 01:48:13.930]  This thing's probably going to hit the next 20, 30 years.
[01:48:14.230 --> 01:48:16.372]  We need you to get in position and warn as many people as possible.
[01:48:16.392 --> 01:48:16.892]  Do you understand?
[01:48:17.333 --> 01:48:20.916]  You're sitting there, these people, these people are not, and it's like they transmute something to you.
[01:48:23.228 --> 01:48:26.469]  My uncle did it too, and I ran comps and read a bunch of other stuff.
[01:48:26.890 --> 01:48:28.310]  He did the same thing when I was a teenager.
[01:48:28.330 --> 01:48:31.591]  He grabbed me by the arm and said, listen, this is really real.
[01:48:31.631 --> 01:48:32.852]  You need to do something about it.
[01:48:33.372 --> 01:48:39.475]  And I guess that's a normal thing for men to tell younger men about what the threat is to charge them up.
[01:48:39.515 --> 01:48:49.138]  But that's what's been missing in the leadership, because the average father is playing golf or going to football with the kids or whatever, but they don't give them a mission.
[01:48:49.178 --> 01:48:52.620]  And I'll be honest, I didn't spend enough time with my children.
[01:48:53.629 --> 01:48:54.349]  I got four children.
[01:48:54.389 --> 01:48:55.270]  Most of them are grown up now.
[01:48:55.610 --> 01:49:01.333]  They're great children, but they just... I was a bad father in many ways, and I repent of that.
[01:49:03.534 --> 01:49:10.277]  But it's just that... And my own father instilled in me leadership and taking action.
[01:49:13.177 --> 01:49:13.958]  It's just incredible.
[01:49:14.118 --> 01:49:15.899]  I mean, we have to do that now, folks.
[01:49:15.919 --> 01:49:16.740]  That's what this is all about.
[01:49:16.760 --> 01:49:27.148]  And there's just some spiritual thing about leaders getting a hold of young people and saying, listen to me, this is what's happening.
[01:49:27.188 --> 01:49:28.269]  You need to choose this mission.
[01:49:28.549 --> 01:49:31.852]  To use an analogy, because everybody knows this archetypally, it's dead now.
[01:49:32.293 --> 01:49:34.294]  It's like Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[01:49:35.275 --> 01:49:36.396]  And he says a little talk with it.
[01:49:38.558 --> 01:49:40.139]  He says, you must go with me to Alderaan.
[01:49:40.159 --> 01:49:42.700]  And he says, I gotta go grow the crops.
[01:49:43.281 --> 01:49:45.742]  I can go to the academy next year.
[01:49:45.762 --> 01:49:47.163]  And he goes, listen, the fight's now.
[01:49:47.183 --> 01:49:51.625]  But of course, by the time Luke Skywalker gets home, his family's all been killed.
[01:49:51.945 --> 01:49:54.667]  Now he knows Obi-Wan Kenobi was right.
[01:49:56.108 --> 01:49:56.948]  This is reality.
[01:49:57.248 --> 01:49:58.109]  This is the war.
[01:49:58.429 --> 01:49:59.290]  This is the future.
[01:49:59.610 --> 01:50:00.530]  This is our victory.
[01:50:01.831 --> 01:50:03.831]  We're fighting a war right now.
[01:50:03.831 --> 01:50:11.110]  Never got him on the show, but he was a listener.
[01:50:11.110 --> 01:50:21.110]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:50:12.898 --> 01:50:13.419]  Talked to him.
[01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:16.321]  Made a song about chemtrails and died.
[01:50:18.543 --> 01:50:22.247]  And that's the guy you're listening to, Merle Haggard, right now.
[01:50:22.687 --> 01:50:24.929]  It's about knowing how many good people are on the team.
[01:50:24.949 --> 01:50:26.971]  Let's hear a little bit from this patriot.
[01:50:29.253 --> 01:50:30.534]  We got all the good people, folks.
[01:50:32.716 --> 01:50:35.399]  Yeah, you're walking on the fighting side of me.
[01:50:38.126 --> 01:50:39.787]  Yeah, some squirrely guy.
[01:50:40.488 --> 01:50:41.509]  Don't believe in fightin'.
[01:50:43.950 --> 01:50:45.211]  They love our milk and honey.
[01:50:47.733 --> 01:50:49.154]  Runnin' down away alive.
[01:50:49.174 --> 01:50:57.481]  Alright, let me go back to your phone calls, but I wanted to say one thing here.
[01:50:59.349 --> 01:51:04.195]  I was thinking about how I had the most incredible mentors as I've grown older.
[01:51:04.215 --> 01:51:05.717]  It was just incredible.
[01:51:05.757 --> 01:51:10.423]  Both my grandfathers, my grandmothers, my mother, my father, all these incredible people.
[01:51:11.284 --> 01:51:17.692]  I felt pushed to fight the new world order and suddenly was just in this world of these incredible people who everything they said has come true.
[01:51:18.653 --> 01:51:20.394]  And imagine the opposite of that.
[01:51:20.414 --> 01:51:29.218]  Our little 4 and 5 and 6 year old children in private and public schools everywhere being taught how to have anal sex.
[01:51:29.598 --> 01:51:31.519]  Being taught how to give blowjobs.
[01:51:31.779 --> 01:51:33.219]  I don't mean to be gross here, it's what's going on.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:35.100]  It's in the news.
[01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:36.241]  They are doing it.
[01:51:36.401 --> 01:51:38.402]  Imagine, they didn't get the leadership I got.
[01:51:40.963 --> 01:51:42.523]  They got the leadership of pedophilia.
[01:51:44.144 --> 01:51:46.145]  Imagine what those children are going to grow up to be like.
[01:51:48.055 --> 01:51:54.119]  Everything I am is because the people around me instilled their energy into me.
[01:51:54.740 --> 01:51:56.821]  They put their energy on me.
[01:51:57.261 --> 01:51:58.702]  Call it a ritual, call it what you want.
[01:51:58.722 --> 01:52:04.126]  They injected their spirit into me of resistance and discernment and will.
[01:52:04.947 --> 01:52:10.030]  They were giving me their power to resist in the future because they knew the fight was coming.
[01:52:10.050 --> 01:52:12.072]  And they're with me now.
[01:52:15.302 --> 01:52:22.369]  And then I look at these pedophiles and these satanists and what they're doing, and I just tell you now, we will defeat them.
[01:52:23.050 --> 01:52:24.331]  We will stop them.
[01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:26.453]  Because it's our destiny.
[01:52:26.813 --> 01:52:30.737]  And if we don't do it, God will damn us to an ETERNITY!
[01:52:31.378 --> 01:52:33.378]  CUT OFF!
[01:52:33.378 --> 01:52:49.176]   The crimes they're committing against children Oh my god.
[01:52:49.236 --> 01:52:52.016]  And the left just loves it.
[01:52:52.036 --> 01:52:53.116]  They think it's so funny.
[01:52:53.156 --> 01:52:55.457]  They think they're part of the power structure.
[01:52:55.477 --> 01:52:56.617]  They think they're on the winning team.
[01:52:56.637 --> 01:53:02.959]  I will assure you, you are not on the winning team and you will pay for what you've done.
[01:53:03.079 --> 01:53:04.479]  You will be broken.
[01:53:05.239 --> 01:53:06.999]  But I take no pleasure in that!
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:09.240]  I want you off our children!
[01:53:10.600 --> 01:53:11.960]  I want you to back off!
[01:53:13.121 --> 01:53:14.161]  But you won't back off.
[01:53:15.162 --> 01:53:24.362]  You won't back off until we make you back off.
[01:53:24.362 --> 01:53:32.201]   For every action as Newtonian physics and as the unified field theory of Max Planck
[01:53:32.201 --> 01:53:38.122]   and Albert Einstein proves, is for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[01:53:38.951 --> 01:53:40.672]  And we are that reaction.
[01:53:41.692 --> 01:53:43.293]  We are the counter to the evil.
[01:53:45.475 --> 01:53:45.895]  We are.
[01:53:48.876 --> 01:53:50.016]  That light in the dark of the night.
[01:53:51.956 --> 01:53:53.636]  God works through us to save the children.
[01:53:54.637 --> 01:53:55.817]  You ask, where are you God?
[01:53:55.937 --> 01:53:57.197]  God asks, where are you?
[01:53:57.557 --> 01:54:05.978]  You've been given all the tools and all the will to easily, easily, defeat these people!
[01:54:06.499 --> 01:54:09.079]  And you didn't do it!
[01:54:10.379 --> 01:54:11.599]  You didn't stand up!
[01:54:11.919 --> 01:54:13.180]  You didn't fight back!
[01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:14.640]  You didn't resist!
[01:54:19.144 --> 01:54:25.229]  So while they abuse and rape and murder our children, God's children, understand that it's on us.
[01:54:28.091 --> 01:54:34.375]  And if we don't start saving these children, and if we don't start standing up, God's gonna hurt us real bad.
[01:54:36.737 --> 01:54:37.257]  You know what?
[01:54:39.919 --> 01:54:40.480]  We deserve it.
[01:54:42.862 --> 01:54:43.622]  So you've been warned.
[01:54:45.303 --> 01:54:45.944]  You've been warned.
[01:54:46.364 --> 01:54:46.724]  Right now.
[01:54:48.402 --> 01:54:58.070]  All you preachers, all you politicians, and all you bankers, and all you big people that get ahead because you serve the system, you've been warned really well.
[01:54:59.531 --> 01:55:03.894]  Because God always posts the notice a thousand times until the judgment comes.
[01:55:04.835 --> 01:55:06.576]  And when it comes, it comes hard.
[01:55:08.778 --> 01:55:12.461]  I have, I'm going to tell you, we're not just going to have food collapse, we're going to have nuclear war.
[01:55:13.702 --> 01:55:14.122]  Very soon.
[01:55:16.003 --> 01:55:16.524]  I have seen it.
[01:55:19.156 --> 01:55:21.757]  So this is everybody's last warning right now.
[01:55:21.797 --> 01:55:31.781]  If you don't pray to God and repent, and if you don't speak out, and if you don't take peaceful, loving action, God is going to end that abortion one way or another.
[01:55:33.361 --> 01:55:37.303]  And God's going to end that pedophilia one way or another, just like Noah's flood, but this time fire.
[01:55:40.364 --> 01:55:41.744]  We are on the knife's edge.
[01:55:42.144 --> 01:55:44.905]  We are on the cliff of oblivion right now.
[01:55:46.266 --> 01:55:46.646]  Right now.
[01:55:49.997 --> 01:55:52.497]  And the servants of Satan hear this and get so scared.
[01:55:52.517 --> 01:55:55.478]  And they think, if we could just shut him up, this wouldn't happen.
[01:55:56.438 --> 01:56:06.460]  You, the servants of the serpent, of the devil, you have manifest this, you have done this, you are bringing us to this point, not me!
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:18.422]  We're gonna go to your phone calls.
[01:56:21.411 --> 01:56:22.091]  Phone calls right now.
[01:56:25.894 --> 01:56:26.534]  Who's up next?
[01:56:28.616 --> 01:56:31.278]  I guess that would be, I guess Regina hung up.
[01:56:33.799 --> 01:56:39.523]  So I guess the next caller will be Al in California.
[01:56:39.863 --> 01:56:40.404]  Al, go ahead.
[01:56:40.424 --> 01:56:40.744]  Welcome.
[01:56:42.376 --> 01:56:47.099]  Mr. Jones, man, it is a pleasure to talk to the boss.
[01:56:48.340 --> 01:56:50.682]  Check it out, bro.
[01:56:50.882 --> 01:56:57.707]  I talked to you many years ago about something about like what you were talking about.
[01:56:58.327 --> 01:57:02.410]  It was timing and synchronicity of our forefathers.
[01:57:04.211 --> 01:57:09.471]   And I had a relative that served under General George Washington and the French India Moors.
[01:57:09.511 --> 01:57:09.992]  Beautiful.
[01:57:10.072 --> 01:57:15.017]  I don't know if it was on the Norrie, George Norrie Show, Coast to Coast.
[01:57:15.517 --> 01:57:16.278]  I remember your call.
[01:57:17.259 --> 01:57:17.939]  Yeah, man.
[01:57:17.959 --> 01:57:24.665]  Dude, I knew when me and you spoke, you know, we kind of connected there.
[01:57:25.246 --> 01:57:35.656]   And I'm telling you, brother, our forefathers have instilled in us The will to fight these SOBs, brother.
[01:57:36.276 --> 01:57:36.796]  Well, that's right.
[01:57:36.816 --> 01:57:39.098]  I was talking to all these great men that inspired me.
[01:57:39.458 --> 01:57:40.199]  They were inspired.
[01:57:40.219 --> 01:57:42.460]  They were handing us the baton.
[01:57:43.381 --> 01:57:45.542]  Yes, absolutely, man.
[01:57:45.662 --> 01:57:47.463]  I mean, I have done everything.
[01:57:47.503 --> 01:57:48.404]  I'm just like you.
[01:57:48.424 --> 01:57:54.468]  I have used every resource I can and my small, limited scope.
[01:57:55.068 --> 01:57:56.969]  You know, I play music.
[01:57:58.110 --> 01:57:59.211]  I'm a recording artist.
[01:58:00.218 --> 01:58:02.400]  Oh brother, that's not limited scope.
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:03.220]  Everything matters.
[01:58:03.941 --> 01:58:07.363]  Yeah, I mean, it is a smaller, you know, it's not major.
[01:58:07.403 --> 01:58:08.604]  It's not small in God's eyes.
[01:58:09.445 --> 01:58:09.665]  Yeah.
[01:58:10.345 --> 01:58:10.765]  Don't hang up.
[01:58:10.785 --> 01:58:11.646]  I'm going to come back to you.
[01:58:11.666 --> 01:58:12.166]  I was ranting.
[01:58:12.206 --> 01:58:14.288]  And then Steve, Dave, and Anna.
[01:58:14.808 --> 01:58:17.030]  And Anna's up next after Al finishes up.
[01:58:18.811 --> 01:58:19.912]  Folks, this is so real.
[01:58:20.172 --> 01:58:21.172]  This is so real.
[01:58:22.513 --> 01:58:23.294]  This is so real.
[01:58:23.354 --> 01:58:24.435]  We're coming to the end of the line now.
[01:58:26.038 --> 01:58:27.599]  Imagine when the power turns off.
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:32.164]  Imagine when all the shows are over and all there is is billions of starving people in war.
[01:58:33.925 --> 01:58:34.706]  Prepare yourselves.
[01:58:35.647 --> 01:58:36.448]  Prepare yourselves now.
[01:58:37.088 --> 01:58:38.249]  There's not much time to stop it.
[01:58:39.491 --> 01:58:40.492]  I'm hoping we can stop it.
[01:58:40.512 --> 01:58:40.872]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.033 --> 01:58:43.895]  All right, let's go back to Al in California.
[01:58:44.055 --> 01:58:44.936]  Al, thank you for holding.
[01:58:45.056 --> 01:58:46.017]  Finish up your great points.
[01:58:47.768 --> 01:58:52.330]  Brother, I can tell you, man, like I was saying, I know the expenditure.
[01:58:52.350 --> 01:58:59.953]  I mean, it's, you know, I play, you know, the punk rock field and I've done everything I can.
[01:59:00.073 --> 01:59:03.035]  The name of my band, do you mind if I shout out my band?
[01:59:04.315 --> 01:59:06.816]  It's Soldier 76, not the video game.
[01:59:06.856 --> 01:59:08.177]  We've been around since 1998.
[01:59:08.917 --> 01:59:12.619]  They stole that video game name from us.
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:24.223]   But anyway, It's arduous, but the roots that we have are huge, man.
[01:59:24.343 --> 01:59:26.044]  I mean, I'm talking about your show.
[01:59:26.064 --> 01:59:29.726]  I always put a thank you on the back of our little 45s that we put out.
[01:59:30.446 --> 01:59:39.831]  And, dude, the effect that you have, and all the other Patriots have, is really, really deep-rooted.
[01:59:41.224 --> 01:59:43.565]  No, no, our roots go deep.
[01:59:43.585 --> 01:59:44.666]  And we're all in this together.
[01:59:44.686 --> 01:59:45.486]  We're going to win, brother.
[01:59:45.506 --> 01:59:48.028]  And I appreciate you and thank you for calling.
[01:59:48.608 --> 01:59:50.389]  Passing on the knowledge is what it's all about.
[01:59:50.409 --> 01:59:53.910]  That's what this whole show is about.
[01:59:53.931 --> 01:59:55.691]  That's what Banned.Video is about.
[01:59:56.392 --> 02:00:01.915]  CNN's Oliver Darcy, before I got banned on Twitter finally three and a half years ago, he goes, what platforms are you on?
[02:00:02.095 --> 02:00:02.795]  Oh, only Twitter?
[02:00:02.815 --> 02:00:03.635]  I'll get you banned today.
[02:00:04.076 --> 02:00:05.917]  Because he thinks, well, I'm a weakling.
[02:00:06.137 --> 02:00:06.897]  I'm a scumbag.
[02:00:06.917 --> 02:00:08.318]  I mean, he is a piece of trash.
[02:00:08.858 --> 02:00:09.658]  I don't say that with pleasure.
[02:00:09.698 --> 02:00:10.359]  I mean, he's the enemy.
[02:00:11.584 --> 02:00:13.465]  And he's just like, I will silence you.
[02:00:13.885 --> 02:00:14.725]  That's how I went.
[02:00:17.826 --> 02:00:18.246]  Oh, really?
[02:00:18.566 --> 02:00:19.306]  You have no viewers.
[02:00:19.566 --> 02:00:22.747]  Your CNN Plus just went belly up in 20 days.
[02:00:23.628 --> 02:00:24.228]  You're cursed.
[02:00:25.408 --> 02:00:26.489]  I don't take pleasure in that.
[02:00:26.509 --> 02:00:30.810]  Because the New World Order is like a dying giant squid.
[02:00:30.830 --> 02:00:34.191]  It just wants to grab us with its tentacles and pull us into hell.
[02:00:35.390 --> 02:00:38.531]  So don't take their weakness as weakness.
[02:00:38.571 --> 02:00:40.191]  Take it as a sign of their commitment.
[02:00:40.991 --> 02:00:42.932]  They are weapons formed against us.
[02:00:44.172 --> 02:00:47.372]  They are overtaken individuals that are slaves.
[02:00:48.893 --> 02:00:50.513]  So don't laugh at how stupid they are.
[02:00:50.573 --> 02:00:53.974]  Don't laugh at how they jibber and giggle and act like gremlins.
[02:00:54.614 --> 02:00:56.854]  Realize that's an overtaken person.
[02:00:57.655 --> 02:00:59.555]  And it's our failure that allowed that to happen.
[02:01:01.707 --> 02:01:03.988]  I'm the guiltiest of celebrating how ridiculous they are.
[02:01:04.868 --> 02:01:05.928]  That's actually their power.
[02:01:07.308 --> 02:01:08.749]  To go against their own free will.
[02:01:08.789 --> 02:01:10.189]  To go against their own interest.
[02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:12.010]  To go against their own families.
[02:01:12.050 --> 02:01:13.130]  To go against their own future.
[02:01:15.831 --> 02:01:18.672]  That's not... That's not something to joke about.
[02:01:18.712 --> 02:01:19.432]  That's death.
[02:01:23.213 --> 02:01:25.253]  Anna, in the great state of Texas.
[02:01:26.354 --> 02:01:27.554]  Anna, thank you so much for calling.
[02:01:27.594 --> 02:01:27.854]  Welcome.
[02:01:28.772 --> 02:01:36.623]  Hey, welcome to the first time on your show, Alex, and I'm from Dallas and my name's Ana, by the way.
[02:01:36.643 --> 02:01:38.505]  Ana, sorry I can't pronounce things.
[02:01:38.685 --> 02:01:39.426]  You're right.
[02:01:39.526 --> 02:01:40.428]  A-N-A-A.
[02:01:40.568 --> 02:01:41.269]  Ana, go ahead.
[02:01:42.461 --> 02:01:52.429]  But the first thing I want to talk about when you showed the video of Barack Obama earlier and he was saying that one out of five people, you know, were not taking the vaccine.
[02:01:52.469 --> 02:02:00.556]  Well, you know, if you look at him, you wouldn't want to take the vaccine because he's 60 years old and he looks 70, you know, and he's been out of office over five years.
[02:02:00.596 --> 02:02:03.458]  You'd think he would look better, but he doesn't.
[02:02:03.518 --> 02:02:04.419]  He looks worse.
[02:02:05.194 --> 02:02:11.021]  And another thing I wanted to say about Parag Agrawal, the Twitter, you know, CEO.
[02:02:11.402 --> 02:02:21.754]  He comes over here on an HB1 visa and he gets himself in this position at Twitter to edit out what Americans have to say and he wasn't even born here.
[02:02:22.295 --> 02:02:24.498]  You know, that's the issue I have with him.
[02:02:25.319 --> 02:02:31.924]  Well, my issue is like the other individual, the owner of one of the major basketball teams saying, I don't care about death camps in China.
[02:02:32.504 --> 02:02:38.449]  So the left doesn't care about death camps in China, but they want to silence you promoting freedom or fighting pedophilia.
[02:02:38.469 --> 02:02:39.770]  These are disgusting people.
[02:02:40.630 --> 02:02:41.831]  Are you talking about Popovich?
[02:02:43.933 --> 02:02:44.633]  I mean, all of it.
[02:02:45.714 --> 02:02:46.955]  The Spurs coach?
[02:02:47.395 --> 02:02:48.236]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:02:48.276 --> 02:02:50.397]  Well, I'm talking about the, no, not Popovich.
[02:02:50.457 --> 02:02:51.939]  It was the Warriors.
[02:02:52.878 --> 02:02:54.479]  It was all over the news a couple months ago.
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:02:58.643]  NBA co-owner says he, quote, doesn't care about the Lakers.
[02:02:58.663 --> 02:02:59.364]  Have you seen that clip?
[02:03:01.365 --> 02:03:01.746]  Well, yeah.
[02:03:01.766 --> 02:03:03.807]  I watch basketball all the time.
[02:03:04.828 --> 02:03:06.069]  Guys, pull it up for us.
[02:03:06.670 --> 02:03:16.798]  It was the owner of the major basketball team said he didn't care about... Let's just play the clip.
[02:03:16.838 --> 02:03:17.699]  Go ahead and back it up.
[02:03:17.719 --> 02:03:18.059]  Play the clip.
[02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:18.360]  Here it is.
[02:03:21.063 --> 02:03:22.924]  Nobody cares about what's happening to the weakers, okay?
[02:03:23.085 --> 02:03:26.347]  You bring it up because you really care, and I think that's nice that you care.
[02:03:26.787 --> 02:03:29.709]  The rest of us don't care.
[02:03:30.050 --> 02:03:33.532]  I'm just telling you a very hard ugly truth, okay?
[02:03:33.632 --> 02:03:36.254]  Of all the things that I care about, yes, it is below my line.
[02:03:37.275 --> 02:03:37.515]  Okay?
[02:03:37.575 --> 02:03:40.837]  Of all the things that I care about, it is below my line.
[02:03:40.877 --> 02:03:43.619]  Great job, crew, getting that.
[02:03:43.659 --> 02:03:45.040]  So that's the CEO of the Warriors.
[02:03:45.060 --> 02:03:45.441]  There you go.
[02:03:47.942 --> 02:03:48.643]  That's pretty bad.
[02:03:50.109 --> 02:03:51.870]  Yeah, it's pretty bad, exactly.
[02:03:56.531 --> 02:03:57.792]  Well, Anna, thank you so much for the call.
[02:03:57.832 --> 02:03:58.492]  We appreciate you.
[02:03:59.092 --> 02:04:01.873]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Pennsylvania.
[02:04:01.913 --> 02:04:03.073]  Go ahead, Dave, you're on the air.
[02:04:03.113 --> 02:04:06.274]  Well, all honor and glory to our Lord Jesus Christ.
[02:04:06.355 --> 02:04:06.835]  Yes, sir.
[02:04:07.475 --> 02:04:10.576]  Hey, it's an honor to talk to you again for the second time.
[02:04:10.716 --> 02:04:15.618]  I just wanted to bring up, I think I know who might be taking that super male vitality out of your desk.
[02:04:16.298 --> 02:04:16.418]  Who?
[02:04:17.469 --> 02:04:18.269]  I think it's Owen.
[02:04:18.309 --> 02:04:21.010]  Looks like his guns are getting a little bit bigger on his show.
[02:04:21.110 --> 02:04:22.450]  I think Owen can kick my ass.
[02:04:22.530 --> 02:04:23.591]  Is he not a specimen?
[02:04:24.151 --> 02:04:25.971]  I think he's pumping some iron now, ain't he?
[02:04:26.451 --> 02:04:28.332]  He plays basketball and lifts weights all day.
[02:04:28.372 --> 02:04:28.712]  He's amazing.
[02:04:28.732 --> 02:04:30.152]  That's what I was thinking.
[02:04:30.192 --> 02:04:31.392]  You better check into him.
[02:04:31.412 --> 02:04:35.593]  I'm a former police officer here in our greatest town of Erie, Pennsylvania.
[02:04:35.613 --> 02:04:40.635]  I wasn't being mean, but somebody is taking the Super Bowl Vitality in X2.
[02:04:40.755 --> 02:04:41.995]  I mean, it's going on here.
[02:04:42.785 --> 02:04:43.065]  Yeah.
[02:04:43.586 --> 02:04:49.630]  Anyways, I just want to talk to you about our illustrious Democratic mayor here in Erie, Mr. Joe Schimber.
[02:04:51.011 --> 02:04:59.458]  And he also stated his main agenda from his own mouth was pushing diversity, equity, inclusion in the typical Democrat position.
[02:04:59.498 --> 02:05:02.840]  But I see that it was very quiet in the news here in Erie.
[02:05:03.894 --> 02:05:08.839]  That he received a $100,000 grant from the Open Society Foundation.
[02:05:08.859 --> 02:05:09.700]  Oh, George Soros!
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:13.223]  Yeah, it was very quiet in the news.
[02:05:15.025 --> 02:05:22.132]  I heard it off of a talk show, a local talk show, where one of the callers called in, and I said, I gotta check into this and see what's going on there.
[02:05:22.973 --> 02:05:27.698]  I don't even know if he knows who the Open Society Foundation is affiliated with.
[02:05:29.466 --> 02:05:33.868]  Well, they're totally anti-free speech, anti-gun, anti-America.
[02:05:34.268 --> 02:05:39.030]  They've taken control of like 800 plus district attorneys and county's attorneys.
[02:05:39.070 --> 02:05:42.071]  They have funded over 20 state attorney generals.
[02:05:43.612 --> 02:05:46.653]  Yeah, the ones that they're letting all the people out of the prisons.
[02:05:46.813 --> 02:05:48.854]  Oh, they're the ones that defund the police?
[02:05:48.894 --> 02:05:49.354]  Everything.
[02:05:49.894 --> 02:05:51.815]  The whole shooting match, exactly.
[02:05:52.848 --> 02:05:56.029]  And I was really surprised because, you know, we're not a big town over here.
[02:05:56.049 --> 02:05:57.129]  We're a little town.
[02:05:57.309 --> 02:06:12.672]  But, you know, he stated, in the spirit of welcoming all immigrants and refugees, I'm pleased to announce that the city of Erie will receive a new grant of $100,000 from the Open Society Foundation.
[02:06:12.992 --> 02:06:20.074]  These funds will support our efforts of diversity that we treasure deeply and are constantly trying to grow.
[02:06:20.554 --> 02:06:21.694]  Isn't that sweet, Alex?
[02:06:23.376 --> 02:06:26.660]  Third world populations, they bring in, they brainwash, they control.
[02:06:27.661 --> 02:06:28.302]  You got it.
[02:06:28.322 --> 02:06:31.465]  Hey, like I said, good talking to you again for the second time.
[02:06:32.066 --> 02:06:32.647]  Love you, Dave.
[02:06:32.667 --> 02:06:33.508]  Thank you so much, sir.
[02:06:34.008 --> 02:06:35.850]  All right, Steve in Seattle.
[02:06:35.890 --> 02:06:36.972]  Talk about an enemy base.
[02:06:37.372 --> 02:06:38.714]  How are you doing in Seattle, Steve?
[02:06:39.815 --> 02:06:40.275]  I'm doing good.
[02:06:40.296 --> 02:06:40.896]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:06:41.477 --> 02:06:42.618]  I'm here still alive, brother.
[02:06:42.678 --> 02:06:43.079]  I'm blessed.
[02:06:44.127 --> 02:06:45.468]  Hey, man, I got a few questions.
[02:06:45.508 --> 02:06:46.528]  I'm a big fan of the show.
[02:06:46.548 --> 02:06:57.913]  Hey, so I watched that documentary on bohemian growth, and I was just curious, one of the questions is, has anyone attempted to go back into technology now?
[02:06:58.963 --> 02:07:02.105]  We have drones now and you know your friends at the Rogan.
[02:07:02.125 --> 02:07:13.052]  Yeah I tried to sneak in about 10 years ago with the History Channel and they arrest everybody but I went and jumped in the river and swam out and escaped.
[02:07:14.052 --> 02:07:19.596]  It's actually it was a Brad Messler program but yeah they arrested him and I escaped.
[02:07:21.117 --> 02:07:30.616]   Okay so you know yeah so okay another one is that You guys always talk about this thing with the pedophile rating, and I was on Reddit when it happened.
[02:07:30.676 --> 02:07:32.699]  I followed that in 2016.
[02:07:33.480 --> 02:07:36.384]  I was curious, is any of this stuff ever going to come out?
[02:07:38.740 --> 02:07:44.204]  Black Book, Maxwell, are these names of these people, like, who are in this stuff, is it ever going to come out?
[02:07:44.464 --> 02:08:01.595]  I'm so glad you raised that, because Josh Hawley, Senator, confronted the new 11th Circuit Court judge, who was the head SPLC lawyer, and pointed out they're literally an anti-American terrorist organization that attacks all free speech, infiltrates groups, everything.
[02:08:02.595 --> 02:08:04.737]  And that is a really good question, Steve.
[02:08:06.312 --> 02:08:08.615]  Hold on, I'll talk about that when we come back.
[02:08:08.435 --> 02:08:12.755]   for a long time and it's just, yeah, you always hear about this stuff, like, oh, like Peg
[02:08:12.755 --> 02:08:17.034]   Dunnerson, Hollywood, like, you know, obviously if you know the names, you know, I'm sure
[02:08:17.034 --> 02:08:22.555]   I know you can't say them all here for lawsuits and stuff, but, yeah, I don't know, I was
[02:08:22.555 --> 02:08:23.555]  just curious.
[02:08:23.555 --> 02:08:24.914]  Hold on, I'll talk about that when we come back.
[02:08:24.914 --> 02:08:27.675]  We got the Josh Hawley clip straight ahead.
[02:08:27.675 --> 02:08:34.474]   Nancy Abudu is the former chief lawyer of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that
[02:08:34.474 --> 02:08:39.634]   wrote the book on doxing and harassment and false reports and media control.
[02:08:39.634 --> 02:08:49.635]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:08:40.944 --> 02:08:45.905]  They're trying to confirm her to head up the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals right now.
[02:08:46.665 --> 02:08:50.466]  And Senator Josh Hawley yesterday brought these points up to her.
[02:08:50.526 --> 02:08:52.807]  There's a big article on Infowars.com.
[02:08:52.847 --> 02:08:55.888]  It's got a bunch of clips, but here's one of those clips right now.
[02:08:57.081 --> 02:09:01.967]  Let me ask you about the Southern Poverty Law Center more generally.
[02:09:02.028 --> 02:09:03.229]  What year did you join SPLC?
[02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:05.280]  February 2021?
[02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:08.321]  I'm sorry, 2019.
[02:09:08.961 --> 02:09:08.321]  2019.
[02:09:09.321 --> 02:09:14.862]  2019 was the year that the SPLC paid $3.4 million in response to defamation lawsuits.
[02:09:14.882 --> 02:09:19.983]  2019 was the year that Charity Watch gave your organization an F rating.
[02:09:20.663 --> 02:09:31.365]  The SPLC has been labeled by the left-wing policy journal Current Affairs as an outright fraud that uses willful deception designed to scare liberals into writing checks.
[02:09:32.025 --> 02:09:41.875]  The progressive journalist Alexander Cockburn said this about SPLC, I regard it, the Southern Poverty Law Center, collectively as one of the greatest frauds in American life.
[02:09:42.435 --> 02:09:52.946]  Liberal death penalty abolitionist Stephen Bright refused to accept an award named after the founder of the SPLC, saying in his words, the SPLC has long been run by a conman and a fraud.
[02:09:52.966 --> 02:09:55.689]  That's from a Harper's Magazine article.
[02:09:56.329 --> 02:10:02.174]  Also in 2019, SVLC employees told the press we were part of a con and we knew it.
[02:10:02.234 --> 02:10:06.498]  That's in a New Yorker article, not exactly a right-wing journal.
[02:10:07.719 --> 02:10:11.903]  Are you concerned by any of this record of the organization that you work for?
[02:10:12.836 --> 02:10:20.701]  Senator, what I'm glad that I didn't hear in that litany is a complaint about the voting rights work that we've done, about the clients and the community.
[02:10:20.721 --> 02:10:38.333]  Are you concerned that Charity Watch gave you an F, that you had to pay $3.4 million in response to defamation lawsuits, that your organization's been criticized as a fraud and a con job, and that you work for an organization that says it's their goal in life to completely destroy their opponents?
[02:10:38.713 --> 02:10:39.814]  None of that gives you any pause.
[02:10:40.737 --> 02:10:53.921]  Senator, again, my work with the Southern Poverty Law Center has been to uphold the constitutional rights of individuals who, without pro bono counsel, would not be even able to have access to justice.
[02:10:54.321 --> 02:10:57.982]  I have to tell you, I find your answers absolutely extraordinary.
[02:10:58.622 --> 02:10:59.643]  Absolutely extraordinary.
[02:10:59.723 --> 02:11:01.824]  I can't believe you've been nominated for this position.
[02:11:02.185 --> 02:11:07.629]  I can't believe that the President of the United States would nominate someone from this organization with this record.
[02:11:07.709 --> 02:11:17.096]  And I can't believe that you would sit here today and refuse to condemn this hateful, frankly, violent rhetoric from this organization with this record.
[02:11:17.176 --> 02:11:17.996]  It's astounding to me.
[02:11:18.997 --> 02:11:20.318]  Well, it is astounding.
[02:11:20.678 --> 02:11:29.443]   They're putting the literal communist Aggressive, murderous scum of the earth in charge of everything.
[02:11:29.883 --> 02:11:31.364]  This is the takeover.
[02:11:31.844 --> 02:11:34.385]  We had an open society, they used it against us.
[02:11:34.625 --> 02:11:37.285]  That's why Soros calls his group the Open Society.
[02:11:37.786 --> 02:11:48.769]  And the Southern Property Law Center, ADL, authoritarian model, is the system and the blueprint and the attack profile for our destruction.
[02:11:49.775 --> 02:12:06.807]  These people are working for mega corporations that create unlimited currency and fraudulent money to take the world over and then as a rearguard action they create race war and division as a distraction while they sexualize our children.
[02:12:08.868 --> 02:12:09.729]  Stop putting up with it.
[02:12:11.090 --> 02:12:11.950]  Support InfoWars.
[02:12:12.671 --> 02:12:13.752]  Pray to God for an awakening.
[02:12:18.356 --> 02:12:22.877]  I don't want that position, but it is true.
[02:12:22.957 --> 02:12:27.498]  It's been placed upon us, this responsibility of what we've got to do.
[02:12:27.598 --> 02:12:36.339]  So go to InfoWarsTore.com, get the little gold ingot art piece we have that's available, the Republic Defense war bonds.

[02:13:06.610 --> 02:13:07.791]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:13:08.292 --> 02:13:16.292]   All right, Paul Joseph Watson from the beautiful countryside of England takes over in T-minus
[02:13:16.292 --> 02:13:34.971]  60 seconds and then the war room in 55 minutes today.
[02:13:34.971 --> 02:13:38.212]   You know, it's going back to what we all thought was going to happen in the 90s when the
[02:13:38.212 --> 02:13:42.212]   internet and mobile technology first came out, which is we thought, you know, this is
[02:13:42.212 --> 02:13:43.492]  going to level the playing field.
[02:13:43.461 --> 02:13:45.542]  Everybody's going to have access to the same information.
[02:13:45.562 --> 02:13:47.944]  Everybody's going to be able to freely communicate that information.
[02:13:48.704 --> 02:13:49.525]  That's our goal.
[02:13:49.925 --> 02:13:54.748]  To get back to that place where we all have access to all of the information.
[02:13:54.848 --> 02:14:00.452]  We all have the ability to freely communicate that information with whomever we want, whenever we want.
[02:14:01.027 --> 02:14:18.940]  And we don't have to worry about anybody tracking what we're doing and trying to judge us or categorize us or figure out some way to go after us because of the conversations we're having, because of the internet searches that we're doing, because of the discussions, the people we want to talk to about these things.
[02:14:19.501 --> 02:14:24.705]  So that's our goal is to help people take back their freedom by helping them to take back their privacy.
[02:14:25.005 --> 02:14:26.406]  And so that's really what we're trying to do.
[02:14:26.466 --> 02:14:32.403]   And so I hope that everybody listening We'll check us out at voltawireless.com.
[02:14:32.243 --> 02:14:34.843]  That's V-O-L-T-A wireless dot com.
[02:14:34.843 --> 02:14:54.643]  [Music]
[02:14:55.351 --> 02:15:03.076]  It is the Summit News Hour, and we're tracking the very latest developments with Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter.
[02:15:03.637 --> 02:15:11.803]  Big changes happening to Twitter over the past few days, despite the fact, as we know, the actual takeover itself is not yet completed.
[02:15:11.843 --> 02:15:14.565]  They're still desperately trying to block it and failing.
[02:15:15.125 --> 02:15:22.891]  But Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter will take three to six months, but we're already seeing massive changes on Twitter itself.
[02:15:23.706 --> 02:15:30.128]  The black-pilled nihilists who suggested that nothing would change have been proven wrong already.
[02:15:30.528 --> 02:15:37.670]  Again, despite the fact, as I just explained, that the takeover isn't going to actually go through and be rubber-stamped for three to six months.
[02:15:38.771 --> 02:15:44.613]  I've personally received about 22,000 new followers on Twitter over the past few days.
[02:15:45.313 --> 02:15:48.834]  That on a platform that's basically been for anyone on the right.
[02:15:48.914 --> 02:15:52.075]  Conservatives completely stagnant for a number of years now.
[02:15:53.362 --> 02:16:03.310]  And is that because they've reduced or they've lifted the suppression algorithms or they digitally burning documents as people have speculated?
[02:16:04.051 --> 02:16:06.152]  We had this article a couple of days ago.
[02:16:07.073 --> 02:16:12.938]  Twitter goes on internal lockdown to prevent woke employees taking revenge for Elon Musk takeover.
[02:16:13.818 --> 02:16:20.924]  Twitter has gone on internal lockdown in order to prevent woke employees from taking revenge in response to Musk's takeover of the company.
[02:16:21.795 --> 02:16:27.060]  Now, of course, this was an internal lockdown on product updates.
[02:16:27.220 --> 02:16:45.515]  They still allow for, quote, business critical updates, but they tweaked a few settings on the back end of Twitter to prevent the irate woke hair pullers from, again, suppressing content from punishing people who are basically celebrating Elon Musk's takeover.
[02:16:45.996 --> 02:16:47.497]  So they put a lockdown on that.
[02:16:48.516 --> 02:16:56.320]  But then we have this article today with people now openly asking the question, is Twitter suppressing algorithms?
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:17:02.143]  Or is it just that there's been a flood of new users coming from Conservatives and the right wing?
[02:17:02.583 --> 02:17:04.104]  I wouldn't be so sure about that.
[02:17:05.253 --> 02:17:11.195]  Given that Truth Social is at number one in the App Store right now, you've got a bunch of new sign-ups on that.
[02:17:11.215 --> 02:17:18.978]  Are Conservatives and right-wingers really rushing back to Twitter in such huge numbers over the past few days?
[02:17:19.998 --> 02:17:27.300]  In fact, Ben Collins reported on the day Elon Musk announced his Twitter takeover, 200,000 Katy Perry followers deactivated.
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:28.261]  200,000 deactivated!
[02:17:28.281 --> 02:17:35.088]   Now, of course, A lot of the Katy Perry followers are just normies.
[02:17:35.508 --> 02:17:37.209]  They're not necessarily political.
[02:17:37.710 --> 02:17:38.810]  Is that bots?
[02:17:39.311 --> 02:17:53.080]  Are they cleaning up a back-end bot system that was gamed to the benefit, that was rigged to the benefit of leftists and to the detriment of conservatives, given that as people like Donald Trump Jr.
[02:17:53.140 --> 02:18:04.464]   are reporting tens of thousands of new followers over the past few days, Leftists, Rachel Maddow, those kind of types, are reporting losing thousands of followers in the past few days.
[02:18:05.204 --> 02:18:09.925]  And we ask the question, is Twitter burning the evidence by unshackling conservative accounts?
[02:18:10.606 --> 02:18:23.429]  A lot of people are noting that their de-booster, their ghost ranking, which you can check on certain websites, has been lifted in the past few days since this takeover was announced, but again not completed.
[02:18:25.037 --> 02:18:31.899]  Conservative Twitter users have noticed a massive uptick in followers and engagement following Elon Musk's Twitter buy.
[02:18:31.939 --> 02:18:34.659]  And of course, part of that is explained because it's in the news.
[02:18:35.339 --> 02:18:39.960]  You will get a lot of sign-ups simply because Twitter has been the big news story now for the past week.
[02:18:40.741 --> 02:18:51.783]  But leftists on the platform are experiencing the inverse, prompting some to wonder if the company is undoing evidence that it rigged the reach of people it deemed to be undesirable.
[02:18:52.694 --> 02:19:42.022]   Now of course right up until 2018 as I said, use myself as the example, constant growth in Twitter followers to the point where I got to about 1.2 million followers a couple of years ago or maybe three years ago, late 2018 was when they really intensified the censorship and then it was completely stagnant and in fact numerous massive conservative accounts not only stopped growing but they had um regular routine purges of quote bot accounts that caused conservative right-wing accounts to lose thousands of followers in a single day and that happened on numerous occasions then of course you get people reporting i followed you and now mysteriously i'm unfollowed from you but i didn't do that so was that a deliberate
[02:19:42.904 --> 02:20:05.541]  Game a deliberate rigging system where they put that into the algorithm, they unfollowed manually a bunch of people from a bunch of top conservative accounts and now they're trying to hide evidence of that because it is essentially election rigging given that they did it again in the year of a midterm election and then intensified it right before the 2020 election.
[02:20:06.081 --> 02:20:08.623]  Are they covering their tracks?
[02:20:09.745 --> 02:20:15.345]   Well, Twitter said in a statement, "We've been looking into recent fluctuations in follower accounts.
[02:20:15.345 --> 02:20:19.104]   While we continue to take action on accounts that violate a spam policy which can affect
[02:20:19.104 --> 02:20:23.664]   follower accounts, these fluctuations appear to largely have been a result of an increase in new
[02:20:23.664 --> 02:20:29.185]  account creation and deactivation. Is that really the case?"
[02:20:29.185 --> 02:20:33.745]  Again, I got 10,000 new Twitter followers yesterday.
[02:20:33.950 --> 02:20:41.937]  Are there 10,000 Conservatives who have come back to the platform simply because Elon Musk has announced he's taken it over?
[02:20:43.038 --> 02:20:46.862]  Again, not everybody is believing that explanation.
[02:20:47.836 --> 02:20:57.803]  Then of course you have the flip side of the equation, which is people being punished, conservatives being punished by woke Twitter employees in revenge for Elon Musk's takeover.
[02:20:57.823 --> 02:20:59.964]  We have this headline out of Information Liberation.
[02:21:00.725 --> 02:21:06.529]  Are Twitter employees taking vengeance on their enemies before Elon Musk eventually cleans house?
[02:21:07.629 --> 02:21:17.348]   They know, for example, that Gab, the big competitor to Twitter, was unverified a couple of days ago But again, that has happened to other major accounts.
[02:21:17.408 --> 02:21:27.256]  In this article, they note that the comedian, the late comedian Norm Macdonald, who passed away about seven months ago, lost his blue checkmark a few weeks ago.
[02:21:27.676 --> 02:21:28.797]  Isn't that nice of them?
[02:21:28.877 --> 02:21:32.320]  The guys literally just died and they take away his blue checkmark.
[02:21:32.880 --> 02:21:38.405]  So now everyone can pretend to be Norm Macdonald's, you know, R.I.P.
[02:21:38.805 --> 02:21:39.786]  memorial account.
[02:21:41.365 --> 02:21:48.410]  According to Bloomberg News, Musk had to lock down Twitter's source code after buying the site due to fears of internal sabotage.
[02:21:48.430 --> 02:21:52.793]  And of course we had the Project Veritas leaked audio of them freaking out about it.
[02:21:53.194 --> 02:22:11.954]   We had the Twitter lawyer, who was instrumental in banning Trump, who was likely behind the banning of Zero Hedge when they put out information regarding the COVID lab leak origin, literally crying bawling her eyes out in a meeting at what might happen at, God forbid, Free speech being allowed.
[02:22:11.974 --> 02:22:15.595]  And then, of course, we have other things.
[02:22:16.775 --> 02:22:18.195]  Gets into it in this article.
[02:22:18.215 --> 02:22:27.218]  We have the Washington Post coming out and saying two days into Musk buying Twitter, he's using his megaphone to help target Twitter employees, prompting a barrage of attacks.
[02:22:27.907 --> 02:22:34.009]  Again, only the left-wing mobs can dogpile and harass people on Twitter.
[02:22:34.449 --> 02:22:38.910]  When Conservatives criticise journalists, that's massive harassment and abuse.
[02:22:39.290 --> 02:22:43.831]  But when the left actually does dox, harass and abuse people, well, that's just them.
[02:22:44.451 --> 02:22:47.732]  Again, making people on the right take responsibility for their words.
[02:22:49.012 --> 02:22:53.934]  Baked Alaska, another prominent former Twitter user who was suspended, he tried to come back.
[02:22:53.994 --> 02:22:54.994]  He was banned within 24 hours.
[02:22:56.417 --> 02:23:05.681]  So it seems to be the case that people who are trying to get back on the platform thinking that it's already changed are being banned, having their accounts once again suspended for ban evasion.
[02:23:06.221 --> 02:23:07.182]  But then you have this.
[02:23:08.382 --> 02:23:25.170]  Of course, Elon Musk, many people speculate, one of the primary reasons for him buying Twitter was his outrage at the Babylon Bee having their account locked for a satirical article announcing the Babylon Bee's man of the year is Rachel Levine.
[02:23:25.822 --> 02:23:33.647]  Now, of course, what happens on Twitter, if you don't delete the tweets that they said have broken their policies, you don't get access back to your account.
[02:23:33.827 --> 02:23:37.629]  It's technically not banned, but you don't have access to it, you can't tweet from it.
[02:23:38.370 --> 02:23:44.934]  Well, lo and behold, today, the Babylon Bees Man of the Year Rachel Levine tweet is back on Twitter!
[02:23:45.574 --> 02:24:00.537]   So somebody has got to have to gone into the back end and lift that suspension on the Babylon Bee, Elon Musk's best mates, that tweet is now back on Twitter and the Babylon Bee presumably now have access back to their account.
[02:24:01.037 --> 02:24:05.579]  So again, there are massive changes afoot in the back end in Twitter.
[02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:07.240]  Are they suppressing the algorithm?
[02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:10.582]  Are they burning, digitally burning documents at least?
[02:24:11.322 --> 02:24:19.046]  And are there changes in terms of once-censored content and potentially once-censored individuals being allowed back on the site?
[02:24:19.086 --> 02:24:20.286]  We'll be back to talk about it more.
[02:24:20.306 --> 02:24:20.927]  Summit.News, don't go away.
[02:24:24.281 --> 02:24:29.665]  We are live, and as I said before the break, 22,000 new Twitter followers in three days.
[02:24:29.685 --> 02:24:41.093]  I posted about that about 20 minutes ago, and basically all the replies below the tweet are saying, I'm a new sign-up, or I came back to Twitter as a result of Elon Musk taking over.
[02:24:41.633 --> 02:24:53.568]   So a lot of those are likely to be new sign-ups, but then you have, for example, in this article which I talked about earlier from Information Liberation, Our Twitter employees taking vengeance on their enemies.
[02:24:53.628 --> 02:24:58.831]  They list the increase in followers that some of these top personalities have seen.
[02:24:59.291 --> 02:25:01.352]  Tucker Carlson, 62,000.
[02:25:01.832 --> 02:25:03.653]  Joe Rogan, 63,000.
[02:25:04.014 --> 02:25:06.415]  Again, that's in the space of two days, basically.
[02:25:07.095 --> 02:25:08.096]  Donald Trump Jr.
[02:25:08.116 --> 02:25:09.057]  has added 87,000 in one day.
[02:25:09.137 --> 02:25:09.497]  Ted Cruz, 51,000.
[02:25:14.048 --> 02:25:24.038]  Then you have, on the flip side, the likes of Kamala Harris losing 22,000, AOC losing 27,000, Hillary Clinton losing 17,000, Rachel Maddow losing 18,000.
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:30.264]  I don't think leftists, to any great degree whatsoever, are fleeing Twitter.
[02:25:30.765 --> 02:25:33.668]  It's like when they say they're going to flee the country if Trump wins again.
[02:25:34.372 --> 02:25:35.453]  They don't do anything.
[02:25:35.513 --> 02:25:38.174]  They just say it to get the dopamine, to get the clicks.
[02:25:38.794 --> 02:25:41.696]  I'm leaving Twitter and yet they don't deactivate their account.
[02:25:42.196 --> 02:25:44.117]  They're not leaving Twitter in droves.
[02:25:44.157 --> 02:25:45.618]  They couldn't bear to do that.
[02:25:46.218 --> 02:25:48.179]  So I reckon there's two things going on.
[02:25:48.220 --> 02:26:03.828]  You are getting a lot of new followers from conservatives returning to the platform, but then you're getting a genuine, authentic bot purge, which is impacting these left-wing accounts that were artificially boosted in the past.
[02:26:04.383 --> 02:26:06.944]  Who have bot followers attached to them.
[02:26:07.504 --> 02:26:12.405]  So I think if you see that trend continuing over the next few days, that looks like what is going on.
[02:26:13.225 --> 02:26:22.828]  Let's go to this video now because Nigel Farage commented on Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter, and this is what the former UKIP leader had to say.
[02:26:22.908 --> 02:26:24.308]  Here is Nigel Farage.
[02:26:25.026 --> 02:26:29.991]  You may say to me, Twitter is not the real world, why do we all bother about it and speak about it so much?
[02:26:30.111 --> 02:26:32.631]  But it's got several hundred million users.
[02:26:32.631 --> 02:26:34.511]  And here's the key point.
[02:26:34.511 --> 02:26:39.790]   Much of what you read, much of what you see on telly, much of what you hear on radio is influenced
[02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:42.630]  by what is said and debated on Twitter.
[02:26:42.630 --> 02:26:48.871]   It has a massive influence over mainstream media and what it reports.
[02:26:48.871 --> 02:26:52.191]   And in the early days, Twitter was rather like the other platforms.
[02:26:52.191 --> 02:26:58.231]   It was a means of many of us getting the argument out because after all, the BBC weren't gonna cover my stuff
[02:26:58.231 --> 02:26:59.271]  in the European Parliament.
[02:26:59.271 --> 02:27:04.510]   Now were they, but I was able through Twitter and other platforms to put out speeches,
[02:27:04.510 --> 02:27:06.591]  to reach really big audiences.
[02:27:06.723 --> 02:27:12.345]  And hey, the master, the global master of Twitter was of course Donald Trump.
[02:27:12.765 --> 02:27:19.348]  His 5.30am tweets from the White House were eagerly anticipated by those that loved him and those that hated him.
[02:27:19.388 --> 02:27:23.590]  But hey, we knew what he thought every day about pretty much everything.
[02:27:24.551 --> 02:27:25.931]  Then something started to change.
[02:27:26.892 --> 02:27:27.712]  Brexit happened.
[02:27:28.412 --> 02:27:29.073]  Trump happened.
[02:27:30.089 --> 02:27:44.499]  And those liberals on the West Coast who'd set up companies like Twitter suddenly were horrified that they'd created organs for free speech that would allow people to make their minds up and make big decisions that they didn't agree with.
[02:27:45.100 --> 02:27:48.322]  And so then it all started to change.
[02:27:48.382 --> 02:27:50.804]  And goodness me, haven't I noticed it?
[02:27:50.844 --> 02:27:54.947]  Because I built up a Twitter following of 1.7 million people.
[02:27:55.586 --> 02:28:01.447]   And it wasn't very difficult every single month to put on 30, 40, 50,000 new followers.
[02:28:01.447 --> 02:28:04.345]  But within the last few years that has completely stopped.
[02:28:04.345 --> 02:28:07.386]  I've had no growth on Twitter whatsoever.
[02:28:07.386 --> 02:28:11.626]   The stuff I put out, the stuff I say, gets seen by far fewer people.
[02:28:11.626 --> 02:28:15.986]   Now it could be that my stuff's really dull and boring, that I've got nothing interesting
[02:28:15.986 --> 02:28:19.105]  to say, no original thoughts whatsoever.
[02:28:19.142 --> 02:28:22.064]  But I don't actually think that's the case.
[02:28:23.124 --> 02:28:25.866]  But there's something called an algorithm.
[02:28:26.066 --> 02:28:27.927]  It's a weird mathematical formula.
[02:28:28.407 --> 02:28:29.988]  I don't fully understand how it works.
[02:28:30.068 --> 02:28:31.149]  I don't think the truth is.
[02:28:31.189 --> 02:28:32.030]  Many people do.
[02:28:32.590 --> 02:28:40.394]   But it's through their algorithms Well, they're able effectively not to ban you from Twitter, but to shadow ban you from Twitter.
[02:28:40.714 --> 02:28:52.205]  Oh, but of course, if you speak out too much about lockdown or issues like that or question global warming too much, you'll find that almost no one sees the stuff that you put out.
[02:28:52.585 --> 02:28:59.771]   So this public square for free speech has actually become Part of something akin to a conspiracy.
[02:29:00.492 --> 02:29:03.935]  We saw the height of it with Hunter Biden in the last election.
[02:29:04.476 --> 02:29:14.304]  All sorts of extraordinary dealings with Ukraine, with Moscow, with Beijing, and yet it hardly got any mention on social media or on mainstream media.
[02:29:14.444 --> 02:29:17.447]  They'd made their minds up, we weren't allowed to know.
[02:29:18.087 --> 02:29:24.011]  And actually, the last couple of years, there's been a constant battle, a constant war, for me, with organisations like Twitter.
[02:29:24.572 --> 02:29:29.235]  But, suddenly, a white knight has appeared, and it is Elon Musk.
[02:29:29.595 --> 02:29:30.696]  Extraordinary figure.
[02:29:31.256 --> 02:29:32.217]  I wasn't sure about him.
[02:29:32.718 --> 02:29:35.259]  You know, I really just couldn't work out who this guy was.
[02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:40.583]  What is clear, he's an absolute devotee of free speech.
[02:29:40.923 --> 02:29:43.605]  Now, yes, of course, free speech has its limits.
[02:29:44.026 --> 02:29:45.226]  Incitement, etc.
[02:29:45.587 --> 02:29:48.209]   should Not be allowed in the public space.
[02:29:49.110 --> 02:29:51.512]  But Musk is committed to free speech.
[02:29:51.552 --> 02:29:54.495]  He's launched this audacious bid to take over Twitter.
[02:29:54.876 --> 02:29:57.298]  The board have accepted the offer that he's made.
[02:29:57.318 --> 02:29:59.661]  He's going to turn it into a private company.
[02:30:00.141 --> 02:30:01.322]  But he will have some problems.
[02:30:01.402 --> 02:30:02.443]  He will face some difficulties.
[02:30:02.463 --> 02:30:08.829]   A friend of mine yesterday I spoke to the senior Twitter executive in the United Kingdom.
[02:30:09.630 --> 02:30:13.673]  My name came up, and the Twitter executive used the C word.
[02:30:14.193 --> 02:30:16.775]  So much for a platform for free speech.
[02:30:17.196 --> 02:30:23.661]  The whole culture of the organisation has been towards censorship, towards cancelled culture.
[02:30:24.081 --> 02:30:29.265]  So frankly, Egon has really, really got to drain the Twitter swamp.
[02:30:29.726 --> 02:30:31.847]  But if anybody can do it, it's this guy.
[02:30:32.088 --> 02:30:41.231]   He's hugely audacious, I noticed Jeff Bezos overnight, the world's second richest man, asking questions about whether this meant China would have influence over Twitter.
[02:30:41.291 --> 02:30:41.691]  It won't.
[02:30:41.991 --> 02:30:44.612]  China banned Twitter a long, long time ago.
[02:30:44.632 --> 02:31:03.638]   So look, let's all later on today raise a glass to Elon Musk, raise a glass to free speech, and let's hope we actually get a proper town square back for public debate for hundreds of millions of people, which then leads to media sources putting stuff out that is This is a really big, exciting moment.
[02:31:03.658 --> 02:31:04.278]  The sun is shining.
[02:31:04.137 --> 02:31:07.137]  This is a big and an important moment.
[02:31:07.137 --> 02:31:11.657]   And even if Donald Trump at the moment is saying, well, he's not really sure whether he's
[02:31:11.657 --> 02:31:14.056]  going to rejoin Twitter, I reckon he will.
[02:31:14.056 --> 02:31:16.576]  It was Twitter that won him the presidency.
[02:31:16.576 --> 02:31:21.137]   And that was why they decided in the end to ban him and to send to the rest of us
[02:31:21.137 --> 02:31:23.696]  who could be seen to the right of the political spectrum.
[02:31:23.696 --> 02:31:27.696]  This is a really big, exciting moment.
[02:31:27.696 --> 02:31:29.617]  The sun is shining.
[02:31:29.617 --> 02:31:31.176]  Hey, everything crossed.
[02:31:34.097 --> 02:31:37.377]   They have Nigel Farage and he mentioned the Hunter Biden laptop story,
[02:31:37.377 --> 02:31:39.176]  and that ties into this story.
[02:31:39.195 --> 02:31:54.713]   Of course the Biden White House, the deep state, the regime, there was a backlash against Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter in the form of them creating this Department of Homeland Security Disinformation unit!
[02:31:54.813 --> 02:31:57.675]  And guess who heads that disinformation unit?
[02:31:58.096 --> 02:32:08.806]  It's a woman who said the Hunter Biden laptop story, completely confirmed, completely authentic, completely genuine, was disinformation, of course!
[02:32:08.886 --> 02:32:15.672]  Because in their eyes, disinformation is any information that is harmful to the regime.
[02:32:16.292 --> 02:32:23.437]  The Department of Homeland Security's new disinformation unit, ZAW, is headed by a woman who says free speech makes her shudder.
[02:32:24.057 --> 02:32:27.580]  She literally has physical convulsions at the very idea of it.
[02:32:28.100 --> 02:32:32.002]  They've falsely labelled the Hunter Biden laptop story disinformation.
[02:32:32.043 --> 02:32:33.463]  This is Nina Jankiewicz.
[02:32:34.004 --> 02:32:46.540]   And again, as I point out in the article, The disinformation units, the fact checkers, are literally there not to check the facts, not to filter the truth, but to bury the truth.
[02:32:46.860 --> 02:32:54.624]  They serve the same purpose that the Ministry of Truth served in Orwell's 1984, which is burying and eliminating the truth.
[02:32:54.623 --> 02:33:04.623]  We'll be back.
[02:33:04.623 --> 02:33:22.462]   Now another phenomenon that we've seen over the past few years is the ideological purity tests
[02:33:22.462 --> 02:33:30.382]   being applied to historical content in terms of art and culture and entertainment. And we had
[02:33:30.382 --> 02:33:34.224]  another example of that.
[02:33:32.478 --> 02:33:46.342]  Just recently, of course now they're making authors sign books where if they put any offensive content in their books that later triggers woke idiots that then the publishing company can cancel their contract.
[02:33:47.042 --> 02:33:49.563]  And they're applying this retroactively as well.
[02:33:49.603 --> 02:33:57.386]  Headline, UK streaming platform censors homophobic line in 2002 Spider-Man movie.
[02:33:58.006 --> 02:34:11.120]   Yes, all the old are, all the old films are being dragged kicking and screaming into the current sensibilities of woke idiots who are offended by literally everything, and being censored.
[02:34:11.761 --> 02:34:22.887]  UK streaming platform ITV Player has censored a homophobic line from the 2002 Spider-Man movie, in yet another example of older content being run through modern politically correct purity tests.
[02:34:23.908 --> 02:34:35.855]   Basically, this was a line in Spider-Man where the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man character ...was facing off against his rival Bonesaw and said, quote, that's a cute outfit, did your husband give it to you?
[02:34:36.936 --> 02:34:49.506]  In the newly censored version being played on ITV Player, in the UK, the line is reduced to, quote, that's a cute outfit, which of course renders the entire scene confusing and meaningless.
[02:34:50.647 --> 02:34:52.248]  We've had other examples of this.
[02:34:52.748 --> 02:34:58.733]  NBC announced that they were scanning 17,000 hours of past WWE content to weed out racist material.
[02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:16.470]  PBS removed Gone With The Wind from its platform entirely because it had a black character who was a maid, a servant to a white family, who by the way was the first black female actress to win an Oscar, so they erased her from history in the name of political correctness.
[02:35:16.971 --> 02:35:19.952]  And of course we had Little Britain in the UK doing a similar thing.
[02:35:20.933 --> 02:35:30.331]   We've had iconic books, Like, literally they rewrote a version of 1984 to reflect modern attitudes and make it more feminist.
[02:35:31.331 --> 02:35:39.737]  So again, just as the fact-checkers are acting as the Ministry of Truth, these ideological purity tests are acting in the same way.
[02:35:40.017 --> 02:35:41.898]  They're running everything through the test.
[02:35:41.978 --> 02:35:50.772]   If it doesn't pass the test, It gets deleted, it gets censored, and maybe in the future nobody will ever remember that it was even there in the first place.
[02:35:51.373 --> 02:35:54.820]  Another thing that's being eliminated in many contexts...
[02:35:55.572 --> 02:35:56.433]  ...is white men!
[02:35:57.013 --> 02:36:09.702]  And now the New York Times has come out and published an article saying basically there aren't enough black women flying commercial airliners, and that there are too many white men flying planes, and we have a clip about that.
[02:36:10.022 --> 02:36:10.582]  Here it is.
[02:36:10.662 --> 02:36:12.804]  Too many white men flying planes.
[02:36:12.864 --> 02:36:13.444]  Let's roll it.
[02:36:14.005 --> 02:36:23.891]   ...published an article complaining about the fact that 95% of airline pilots are men, and that almost all of that number are also, wait for it, White!
[02:36:24.171 --> 02:36:25.572]  Oh no, the absolute horror.
[02:36:25.672 --> 02:36:30.134]  They're demanding the industry embrace greater, quote, pilot diversity.
[02:36:30.234 --> 02:36:30.915]  Yeah, really.
[02:36:31.075 --> 02:36:35.817]  About 95% of airline pilots in the US today are male, and nearly as many are white.
[02:36:36.177 --> 02:36:40.759]  Now, with pilots in short supply, there's urgency for the industry to act on diversifying.
[02:36:40.899 --> 02:36:42.800]  Piloting is stubbornly monolithic.
[02:36:42.860 --> 02:36:46.142]  About 95% of airline pilots in the US today are male.
[02:36:46.522 --> 02:36:47.963]  Nearly as many are white!
[02:36:48.063 --> 02:36:50.485]  As if there's anything wrong with being a white male.
[02:36:50.885 --> 02:36:51.405]  There isn't!
[02:36:51.986 --> 02:36:53.346]  It's okay to be white.
[02:36:53.587 --> 02:37:05.154]  Few women and people of color aspire to fly planes because they rarely see themselves in today's flight decks, states the article, seemingly ignorant of the fact that women don't choose high-pressure jobs that are more suited to men.
[02:37:05.234 --> 02:37:09.937]  And quote, women of color only represent a fraction of the population of the United States.
[02:37:10.077 --> 02:37:21.601]  The article quotes Alan Mayer, a history professor at Auburn University, who blames the stereotype of the quote, often subconscious association between whiteness and maleness and technical competence.
[02:37:21.842 --> 02:37:27.324]  Or it could just be that white men tend to be quite good at technical things, because they're generally smart and competent.
[02:37:27.404 --> 02:37:36.047]  Apparently, however, the most important thing when it comes to airline pilots is not their competency in flying a plane, but their ethnic background.
[02:37:36.287 --> 02:37:46.677]  If ever there was a profession where diversity quotas should be ignored, and the best person possible, regardless of race, be given the job, it's airline pilot.
[02:37:46.717 --> 02:37:49.540]  But that would be common sense, and the left doesn't do common sense.
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:50.401]  What's next?
[02:37:50.501 --> 02:37:55.326]  Are they gonna whine about there not being enough people of colour in charge of the nuclear codes?
[02:37:58.416 --> 02:37:58.936]  There you have it.
[02:37:58.976 --> 02:38:00.838]  Let's move on to Covid.
[02:38:01.058 --> 02:38:17.047]  Yes, Covid still exists, and the people who push devastating lockdowns, mask mandates, vaccine passport mandates, have scuttled away with their tails between their legs and not taken responsibility for being on the wrong side of history.
[02:38:17.067 --> 02:38:22.871]  And we have two major, massive new examples of that that just occurred over the past few days.
[02:38:23.683 --> 02:38:28.826]  There's a big outbreak of hepatitis among children in numerous different countries across the world.
[02:38:29.306 --> 02:38:30.507]  And guess what caused it?
[02:38:30.947 --> 02:38:31.868]  Lockdowns.
[02:38:32.128 --> 02:38:36.991]  Outbreak of hepatitis in children caused by lockdowns that weakened immunity.
[02:38:37.371 --> 02:38:47.016]  Yes, humans do still have immune systems that are supposed to be exposed to different viruses so they can maintain strength and immunity.
[02:38:47.256 --> 02:38:48.157]  The clues in the name.
[02:38:48.997 --> 02:38:51.879]  Well, now a shocking outbreak of hepatitis cases in children.
[02:38:52.717 --> 02:38:59.702]  May have been caused by lockdowns and social distancing which serve to weaken immune systems, according to health experts.
[02:39:00.402 --> 02:39:12.170]  The global surge of this hepatitis outbreak amongst children has so far impacted 12 different countries, with 169 cases of acute hepatitis of unknown origin detected since last October.
[02:39:12.771 --> 02:39:26.115]   This is occurring in children under the age of 5, 17 so far that we know of have required liver transplants, and 1 Unfortunate child has died as a result of this hepatitis.
[02:39:27.135 --> 02:39:35.857]  The reason it's happening is because of course kids are supposed to be exposed to viruses at a young age so they build up natural immunity.
[02:39:36.317 --> 02:39:37.697]  They're not being exposed.
[02:39:38.217 --> 02:39:43.818]  What happens is that this virus is supposed to manifest itself as the common cold.
[02:39:44.318 --> 02:39:47.579]  The kids are supposed to have natural immunity defenses against that.
[02:39:47.999 --> 02:40:12.159]  But because their natural immunity has been completely obliterated by the fact that they were kept out of school, kept away from other children, made to wear masks in many cases, they don't have that natural immunity that can fight the common cold, so then this virus turns into hepatitis, a more serious illness of course, and this is causing deaths and the need for organ transplants in children under five.
[02:40:13.140 --> 02:40:29.967]   And they quote Professor Simon Taylor Robinson, In the Daily Mail, who said, quote, I think it's likely that children mixing in kindergartens and schools have lower immunity to seasonal adenoviruses than in previous years because of restrictions, in other words, because of lockdown.
[02:40:30.528 --> 02:40:36.349]  This means they could be at more risk of developing hepatitis because their immune response is weaker to the virus.
[02:40:36.409 --> 02:40:43.890]  So, yet again, another concrete example of lockdown causing devastating long-term impacts, this time targeting children.
[02:40:44.884 --> 02:40:48.406]  And again, in this second instance, targeting kids.
[02:40:49.166 --> 02:40:49.526]  Study.
[02:40:49.626 --> 02:40:55.109]  Lockdowns drove 60,000 children in the UK alone to clinical depression.
[02:40:55.729 --> 02:41:04.373]  This is a study published in the Royal Society Open Science Journal, which found that lockdowns in the UK caused around 60,000 children to suffer clinical depression.
[02:41:05.153 --> 02:41:18.205]   They detected, the researchers in this study, A 27.1% prevalence of depression amongst their sample of kids, a number significantly higher than would have occurred without lockdowns.
[02:41:18.285 --> 02:41:26.987]  And the Telegraph reports that that equates to about 60,000 extra kids who suffered clinical depression who wouldn't otherwise have been in that horrible situation.
[02:41:27.908 --> 02:41:31.292]  If not for Covid-19 lockdowns.
[02:41:31.732 --> 02:41:45.887]  Last year in the UK we had 400,000 kids referred to mental health specialists because they had things like eating disorders, self-harm, again a lot of that driven by the isolation, by the depression caused by lockdown.
[02:41:46.828 --> 02:41:53.711]   We've had speech therapists Reporting a 364% increase in patient referrals of babies and toddlers.
[02:41:54.172 --> 02:41:57.133]  They're having cognitive developmental disorders.
[02:41:57.513 --> 02:42:04.297]  They're having difficulties learning to speak because of being in isolation, because of adults wearing masks.
[02:42:04.897 --> 02:42:12.521]  And I still see parents in the UK making their five-year-old kid wear a mask outside.
[02:42:13.001 --> 02:42:17.163]  Literally stunting the cognitive development of their own kid.
[02:42:18.430 --> 02:42:22.773]  Presumably to virtue signal, you know, in support for the current thing.
[02:42:23.234 --> 02:42:24.595]  I still see that everywhere.
[02:42:25.656 --> 02:42:31.040]  Major study by Johns Hopkins concluded global lockdowns had a massive detrimental impact on society.
[02:42:31.340 --> 02:42:34.542]  You were on the wrong side of history for promoting it and advocating it.
[02:42:35.063 --> 02:42:38.805]  We have big news, believe it or not, out of Belgium.
[02:42:39.306 --> 02:42:41.888]  Yes, the sleepy European country.
[02:42:42.634 --> 02:42:53.763]  Where, in the capital city of Brussels, the majority of kids are now being born with the name Mohammed, or at least Islamic names take up almost 50% of newborn babies.
[02:42:54.843 --> 02:43:02.209]  Belgians are a minority, native Belgians are a minority in their own capital city, just like white English people are in London.
[02:43:02.810 --> 02:43:12.038]   And now we have a big story because a leftist leader The head of the Socialist Party there has admitted that multiculturalism basically has failed.
[02:43:12.378 --> 02:43:29.666]  He was driving through the very diverse part of Brussels called Molenbeek, the notorious migrant ghetto where the Paris massacre suspect Salar Abdeslam hid out for four months and was able to evade police because he was basically embedded and protected by the community.
[02:43:30.754 --> 02:43:36.306]  And there's been a massive uproar in Belgium in response to this leftist leader's comments.
[02:43:36.446 --> 02:43:37.188]  What did he say?
[02:43:37.408 --> 02:43:38.390]  Let's go to the clip.
[02:43:38.731 --> 02:43:39.152]  Here it is.
[02:43:40.131 --> 02:43:47.153]  A leftist leader in Belgium caused alarm amongst his own political allies after admitting that multiculturalism had failed.
[02:43:47.173 --> 02:43:55.035]  The president of Belgium's Social Democrat Voorhees Progress Party, Conor Rousseau, caused leftists to hyperventilate when he let slip the truth.
[02:43:55.175 --> 02:44:05.941]   Speaking about Molenbeek, an area in Brussels that has a 40% Muslim population, Rousseau said, quote, when I drive through Molenbeek, I don't feel like I'm in Belgium.
[02:44:05.981 --> 02:44:13.308]  The socialist leader said integration have failed to such an extent that most people were born there, yet can't even speak French.
[02:44:13.548 --> 02:44:19.193]  Quote, in Brussels, due to the shortage of teachers, there are people who teach in Arabic because they don't even speak French.
[02:44:19.253 --> 02:44:23.197]  This is unacceptable, Rousseau said, and what is the Flemish government doing?
[02:44:23.257 --> 02:44:26.860]  It increases the cost of language courses to reduce waiting lists.
[02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:33.685]  Rousseau noted that in some areas schools only teach in Arabic, and children are not even encouraged to learn Dutch or French.
[02:44:33.825 --> 02:44:37.848]  The leftist leader's comments provoked a hissy fit amongst his own colleagues.
[02:44:37.948 --> 02:44:44.152]  The head of the Socialist Party's parliamentary group, Ahmed Laouge, denounced Rousseau's comments as intolerable stupidity.
[02:44:45.392 --> 02:44:51.294]  His main gripe was that Russo had offended Brussels' diverse and cosmopolitan population.
[02:44:51.334 --> 02:44:51.915]  Boo-hoo!
[02:44:52.095 --> 02:45:00.858]  Mayor Catherine Mourou called Russo contemptuous, while even members of his own party went public to condemn his completely truthful comments.
[02:45:01.018 --> 02:45:10.841]  Molenbeek is a migrant ghetto so notorious, Salar Abdeslam, one of the Paris Massacre Jihadists, was able to hide out in the community for four months while evading police.
[02:45:11.001 --> 02:45:17.383]   When I visited Molenbeek right after the Paris Massacre, I was refused service in shops for being white.
[02:45:17.764 --> 02:45:20.445]  In Brussels, a European capital.
[02:45:20.545 --> 02:45:26.587]  The most popular name for newborn babies in the de facto EU capital of Brussels is, you guessed it, Mohamed.
[02:45:26.667 --> 02:45:32.690]  Islamic names make up 43% of total registrations in the Belgian capital city.
[02:45:32.710 --> 02:45:37.312]  The top four is Mohamed, Jean, Mohamed again with a different spelling, and Ahmed.
[02:45:37.412 --> 02:45:40.333]  Native Belgians are now a minority in Brussels.
[02:45:40.513 --> 02:45:46.856]  Well, across the whole country, 48% of babies were born to a foreign mother or a mother of foreign origin in the last year.
[02:45:48.637 --> 02:45:54.080]  53.2% of residents in Antwerp, Belgium's most populous city, are now of immigrant origin.
[02:45:54.240 --> 02:46:00.063]  Unsurprisingly, Belgian cities are routinely rocked by migrant riots, including massive unrest in Anderlecht in April 2020.
[02:46:00.103 --> 02:46:04.064]   An event to mark to mark Black History Month, which took place in Brussels
[02:46:04.064 --> 02:46:08.182]   in March 2020, told white people that they were not welcome unless they paid a fee and
[02:46:08.182 --> 02:46:09.663]  cleaned up after black people.
[02:46:09.663 --> 02:46:13.504]   Later that year, after Black Lives Matter protesters in the city of Antwerp defaced
[02:46:13.504 --> 02:46:18.703]   a statue of King Leopold II, Belgium's longest reigning monarch, authorities removed it and
[02:46:18.703 --> 02:46:20.143]  put it in a museum.
[02:46:20.143 --> 02:46:25.663]  But remember guys, diversity's a strength.
[02:46:25.663 --> 02:46:32.384]   Meanwhile, staying in Europe, again we have governments justifying this reduction in living
[02:46:32.384 --> 02:46:38.064]   standards by citing support for the current thing, despite the fact that this lowering
[02:46:38.064 --> 02:46:40.862]  of living standards, a reduction in life quality.
[02:46:41.118 --> 02:46:45.779]  Has been part of the Great Reset Agenda for many years.
[02:46:45.839 --> 02:46:49.840]  This whole failed green economy narrative has been a part of it.
[02:46:49.860 --> 02:46:57.082]  They're merely now transitioning it into support Ukraine because that's more popular amongst the masses, amongst the NPCs.
[02:46:57.882 --> 02:47:02.283]  We have a headline here, Italy to start rationing energy to support Ukraine.
[02:47:03.007 --> 02:47:22.713]  From next month onwards, Italy will begin rationing electricity to support Ukraine, with public buildings banned from running air conditioning at lower than 25 degrees, or heating higher than 19 degrees, and they're encouraging, encouraging at this stage, not forcing, businesses and private individuals to do the same.
[02:47:23.694 --> 02:47:27.115]  The plan is being dubbed Operation Thermostat and is being hailed.
[02:47:27.699 --> 02:47:41.102]  As the example for Italians to follow in their own private homes, the Prime Minister there, Mario Draghi, promoted the campaign by asking, quote, do we want to have peace or do we want to have the air conditioning on?
[02:47:41.662 --> 02:47:56.105]  So either, you know, you can look trendy, you can be a moral exhibitionist, you can get all the dopamine from that, you can feel good about yourself for essentially doing nothing, or you can live in comfort, have heating and air conditioning.
[02:47:56.465 --> 02:47:58.067]  I know which one that I'd choose.
[02:47:58.647 --> 02:48:03.872]  Presumably, the price of peace is now a permanent reduction in your quality of life.
[02:48:04.893 --> 02:48:16.303]  Kit Knightley commented, quote, I'm not exactly sure how adjusting your thermostat is going to achieve peace, but hey, we're living in the age of sentimental manipulation over reason, so just believe.
[02:48:17.143 --> 02:48:19.425]  And on that subject, we have a final video here.
[02:48:20.426 --> 02:48:27.057]   Because everywhere I go, where I live, Visit the nice, well-to-do villagers here in the Cotswold region.
[02:48:27.538 --> 02:48:40.295]  There are people who earn significant amounts of money and have significant amounts of wealth reserves, very proudly displaying their support for the current thing, while much of the rest of the country enters.
[02:48:40.675 --> 02:48:49.683]  Fuel poverty can't afford to fill up their tank, to go travelling anywhere, and of course has to pay increasingly higher and higher food prices.
[02:48:50.103 --> 02:48:53.005]  Many people now slipping below the poverty line.
[02:48:53.306 --> 02:48:57.629]  But again, it's all to support the current thing, to support Ukraine.
[02:48:57.689 --> 02:48:58.510]  Here is the video.
[02:48:58.650 --> 02:48:59.010]  Enter.
[02:48:59.271 --> 02:49:01.292]  Poverty to support Ukraine.
[02:49:01.332 --> 02:49:01.873]  Let's roll it.
[02:49:02.506 --> 02:49:07.170]  Go driving in well-to-do areas of England, and you'll be met with a familiar sight.
[02:49:07.230 --> 02:49:12.414]  Profusely performative moral exhibitionist appeals to support Ukraine.
[02:49:12.474 --> 02:49:12.735]  How?
[02:49:13.395 --> 02:49:19.240]  Giant flags, some not even displaying the proper colours, signs in the window, ribbons on the front gate.
[02:49:19.420 --> 02:49:24.221]  Quite how this, in any way materially, supports Ukraine is anyone's guess.
[02:49:24.301 --> 02:49:30.883]  Seems like the primary purpose is to make these privileged posh twats feel less self-conscious about their wealth guilt.
[02:49:31.004 --> 02:49:37.686]  And yet, for much of the rest of the country, the clamour to support Ukraine is pushing them closer to poverty.
[02:49:37.766 --> 02:49:45.808]  Petrol and diesel prices, already climbing before the conflict started, have gone virtually parabolic since the sanctions on Russia.
[02:49:46.028 --> 02:49:49.913]  Four in ten Brits face entering fuel poverty later this year.
[02:49:49.973 --> 02:49:55.238]  Customers' debts are expected to rise 50% or £800 million.
[02:49:55.419 --> 02:50:00.845]  Come October, that's going to get horrific, truly horrific, said Scottish Power CEO Keith Anderson.
[02:50:01.245 --> 02:50:07.432]  It has got to a stage now where the size and scale of it is beyond what I can deal with, beyond what I think this industry can deal with.
[02:50:07.432 --> 02:50:13.453]  He says the company is being deluged by calls from panicked customers worried about how they're going to pay the bill.
[02:50:13.514 --> 02:50:18.915]  We're expecting a severe impact on customers' ability to pay, said E.ON's UK Chief Executive.
[02:50:19.015 --> 02:50:26.817]  EDF Energy Chief Executive Simone Rossi says they've received a 40% spike in calls from customers alarmed at soaring prices.
[02:50:26.957 --> 02:50:27.337]  So yeah.
[02:50:27.597 --> 02:50:35.506]  It's very easy to display your support for Ukraine if you own three Range Rovers, an eight-bedroom manor house, and a hundred acres of land.
[02:50:35.586 --> 02:50:43.895]   An extra 20 quid here and there to fill up the tank, an extra 700 quid a year in heating costs, is barely even I'm gonna touch the sides.
[02:50:44.055 --> 02:50:51.541]  But to many others, it's the difference between being able to put food on the table, the price of which is also skyrocketing.
[02:50:51.641 --> 02:51:11.717]  So maybe before you feel the need to signal your virtue about supporting Ukraine, with your stupid flags and your little ribbons, to try and one-up your neighbours in your rich Cotswold enclave, because their flag's bigger than yours, think just for a single second about the impact this is having on those who can't afford to support Ukraine.
[02:51:11.817 --> 02:51:19.003]  Because of our support for Ukraine, and because of the sanctions, they can barely afford to support their own families.
[02:51:21.945 --> 02:51:26.949]  Now spare a thought for the poor Germans, because the situation's even worse in their country.
[02:51:26.969 --> 02:51:34.855]  Of course, Germany imported, up until recently, 55% of its gas from Russia, along with a third of its oil and 45% of its coal.
[02:51:35.596 --> 02:51:54.482]   They have government ministers there telling them to take fewer showers to support Ukraine, They also have government ministers telling them to cope with soaring energy costs by wearing warmer sweaters, which, by the way, if old people don't properly heat their homes, no matter how much clothing they're wearing, they can literally die.
[02:51:55.323 --> 02:51:57.085]  Well now, lo and behold, we have this!
[02:51:57.165 --> 02:52:00.528]  German inflation hits four-decade high for a single month!
[02:52:01.181 --> 02:52:05.445]  Germany's inflation rate rose at its fastest pace since before reunification.
[02:52:05.985 --> 02:52:11.450]  Data for April published on Thursday showed as Russia's invasion of Ukraine sparked a rise in energy prices.
[02:52:11.831 --> 02:52:16.435]  It's not the invasion that sparked it, it's your sanctions that sparked it.
[02:52:16.895 --> 02:52:18.477]  Take responsibility!
[02:52:19.341 --> 02:52:32.138]  Meanwhile though, Germany apparently has plenty of money, despite inflicting this unprecedented inflation on its population, to send anti-aircraft systems to Ukraine in policy shift.
[02:52:32.218 --> 02:52:37.543]   They're sending a fleet of around 50 anti-aircraft systems That's going to wrap it up for now.
[02:52:37.583 --> 02:52:38.383]  War Room is next.
[02:52:38.403 --> 02:52:38.723]  Summit.News.
[02:52:38.542 --> 02:52:44.301]   who is already laboring, suffering under record rampant inflation. We also have of
[02:52:44.301 --> 02:52:51.141]   course Joe Biden just sending a further 33 billion in military aid directly to
[02:52:51.141 --> 02:52:55.622]   support the current thing. I don't think American taxpayers were asked about that,
[02:52:55.622 --> 02:53:01.942]   were they? That's gonna wrap it up for now. War Room is next. Summit.News, now go away.
