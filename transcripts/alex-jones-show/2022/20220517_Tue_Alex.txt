[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:02.811]  This is going to be, again, an incredible broadcast.
[00:00:03.212 --> 00:00:05.674]  And remember, freedom is not a spectator sport.
[00:00:06.194 --> 00:00:10.938]  We need everybody, every man, woman, and child in the arena spreading the word about the resistance.
[00:00:11.058 --> 00:00:13.260]  It's an info war, hence Info Wars.
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.601]  We have the enemy's number.
[00:00:15.321 --> 00:00:23.848]  And if more people tune into this broadcast, and if those people tell others to tune in, and they tell others to tune in, and they tell others to tune in, the chain reaction is set.
[00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.097]  And we are unstoppable with God's blessing.
[00:00:28.897 --> 00:00:30.238]  That is just some of what's coming up.
[00:00:30.338 --> 00:00:33.340]  Elon Musk is en fuego, en fuego.
[00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.842]  I mean, this is just he's coming out against the globalists as we're going to become Venezuela.
[00:00:38.283 --> 00:00:40.064]  Says Biden is a complete total puppet.
[00:00:40.664 --> 00:00:44.526]  Whoever writes the teleprompter statements is the president, which is totally true.
[00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:47.808]  It's a consortium, basically Obama and the group behind him.
[00:00:47.828 --> 00:00:54.052]  This is one hell of a time to be alive, right?
[00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:59.081]  Now, the pendulum is swinging back massively against the New World Order.
[00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.044]  We were all supposed to be off the air by now.
[00:01:01.425 --> 00:01:05.352]  We were supposed to be silenced so we could carry this out, but we're not silenced thanks to you.
[00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:10.825]  So, Infowars.com forward slash show, ban.video.
[00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:15.109]  The link you can share that isn't censored or blocked is battleplan.news.
[00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:22.217]  Battleplan.news takes you right to ban.video, the home of the resistance and forbidden, verboten information.
[00:01:22.617 --> 00:01:23.218]  Stay with us.
[00:01:23.277 --> 00:01:33.277]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:33.868]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:34.628]  It's Tuesday, May 17th.
[00:01:34.648 --> 00:01:35.209]  The year is 2022.
[00:01:35.108 --> 00:01:50.828]   Jones. It's Tuesday, May 17th. The year is 2022. I am your host Alex Jones. Probably
[00:01:50.828 --> 00:01:52.987]  the greatest documentary filmmaker living.
[00:01:53.256 --> 00:01:54.176]  Definitely a patriot.
[00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:56.958]  Dinesh D'Souza will join us in the second hour.
[00:01:56.978 --> 00:02:00.419]  We have some other really amazing guests as well today.
[00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.940]  I want to just say this up front as we kick off.
[00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:06.061]  I appreciate the viewers and listeners.
[00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:06.721]  You're incredible.
[00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:10.263]  You are the heart of the worldwide resistance to the globalists.
[00:02:11.063 --> 00:02:22.142]   And as their plan unfolds, and as the general public figures out the nightmare situation we're in, every seed that you've planted, every person that you've warned
[00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:29.822]   will basically realize that you were right and understand that they've got to resist what's
[00:02:29.822 --> 00:02:35.342]   happening. The real power of this broadcast is that we know the enemy plan and now as it's
[00:02:35.342 --> 00:02:37.502]  coming to fruition the credibility is exploding.
[00:02:37.646 --> 00:02:38.547]  It's the same thing for you.
[00:02:38.607 --> 00:02:45.652]  So that's the silver lining to this very, very dark cloud formation, this storm that we're all going into together.
[00:02:46.553 --> 00:02:48.774]  Incredible broadcast today.
[00:02:48.814 --> 00:02:51.937]  Just unbelievable developments on so many fronts.
[00:02:52.657 --> 00:02:54.679]  Canada, the Canadian government, and others.
[00:02:55.714 --> 00:03:00.337]  Have announced that they are rolling out a Davos Group national ID card, medical ID.
[00:03:00.377 --> 00:03:01.278]  Now, we already knew that.
[00:03:01.298 --> 00:03:02.979]  It was in the documents years ago.
[00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:04.660]  That was the whole rollout plan.
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.002]  It's official and it's happening in Europe.
[00:03:07.782 --> 00:03:08.763]  Incredible!
[00:03:09.663 --> 00:03:20.290]  Also, they're saying anyone that talks about the UN plan for replacement migration is a white supremacist when it's a UN plan to bring in 600 plus million people into the United States alone by 2040.
[00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.553]  So I guess they can be more orderly depopulated.
[00:03:25.113 --> 00:03:26.134]  That is in the documents.
[00:03:27.054 --> 00:03:41.321]  We have huge developments on the worldwide food crisis that's accelerating, and we have big, big developments in Ukraine, with some major Ukrainian forces surrendering, and the corporate media even refusing to report on that.
[00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:50.345]  And we also have Senator Paul still holding up the $40 billion money laundering operation for Obama and Biden and the New World Order and Soros.
[00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:55.779]  And we have some really serious news with two more countries in Western Europe, Northern Europe.
[00:03:56.877 --> 00:04:00.078]  Secondly, we'll join NATO, which is a red line for Russia.
[00:04:00.118 --> 00:04:03.298]  This is just a wild, wild time to be alive.
[00:04:03.318 --> 00:04:07.699]  Of course, the huge news that broke during the show yesterday, but I didn't properly cover it.
[00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:08.399]  We have the video.
[00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:10.859]  Project Veritas senior engineer.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.300]  Project Veritas caught this on hidden camera.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.581]  A senior engineer lashes out at Elon Musk, admits Twitter does not believe in free speech.
[00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:20.141]  That's a quote.
[00:04:20.181 --> 00:04:21.581]  And we are effing commies.
[00:04:22.221 --> 00:04:23.842]  So this is all on video.
[00:04:23.942 --> 00:04:24.722]  That's coming up.
[00:04:26.104 --> 00:04:32.591]  As well, we have Obama's Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke now warning of coming stagflation under Biden.
[00:04:32.992 --> 00:04:33.913]  I told you that's what's coming.
[00:04:33.953 --> 00:04:34.594]  That's the plan.
[00:04:36.836 --> 00:04:37.917]  This and so much more.
[00:04:37.937 --> 00:04:40.941]  We have the new super arrogant press secretary.
[00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:46.367]  I mean, if you thought Jen Psaki was arrogant, I didn't think they could find somebody as arrogant.
[00:04:47.438 --> 00:04:51.301]  And it just puts on this affectation of total supremacy.
[00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:52.702]  But this dingbat does it.
[00:04:53.303 --> 00:04:58.247]  And we're going to be looking at some of her floundering around and gaslighting today as well.
[00:04:58.287 --> 00:05:01.049]  This is going to be, again, an incredible broadcast.
[00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:03.891]  And remember, freedom is not a spectator sport.
[00:05:04.432 --> 00:05:09.156]  We need everybody, every man, woman, and child in the arena spreading the word about the resistance.
[00:05:09.276 --> 00:05:10.216]  It's an info war.
[00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:11.478]  Hence, info wars.
[00:05:11.538 --> 00:05:12.759]  We have the enemy's number.
[00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:26.330]  And if more people tune into this broadcast, and if those people tell others to tune in, and they tell others to tune in, and they tell others to tune in, the chain reaction is set, and we are unstoppable with God's blessing.
[00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.451]  That is just some of what's coming up.
[00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:31.494]  Elon Musk is en fuego, en fuego.
[00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:38.271]  I mean, this is just he's coming out against the globalists as we're going to become Venezuela, says Biden is a complete total puppet.
[00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:42.733]  Whoever writes the teleprompter statements is the president, which is totally true.
[00:05:42.773 --> 00:05:46.014]  It's a consortium, basically Obama and the group behind him.
[00:05:46.034 --> 00:05:51.757]  This is one hell of a time to be alive.
[00:05:52.037 --> 00:05:52.257]  Right.
[00:05:52.717 --> 00:05:57.287]  Now, the pendulum is swinging back massively against the New World Order.
[00:05:57.327 --> 00:05:59.271]  We were all supposed to be off the air by now.
[00:05:59.632 --> 00:06:03.580]  We were supposed to be silenced so we could carry this out, but we're not silenced thanks to you.
[00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:13.331]  So, infowars.com forward slash show, ban.video, the link you can share that isn't censored or blocked is battleplan.news.
[00:06:13.471 --> 00:06:20.412]  Battleplan.news takes you right to ban.video, the home of the resistance and forbidden, verboten information.
[00:06:20.812 --> 00:06:21.412]  Stay with us.
[00:06:21.672 --> 00:06:24.693]  I'm Alex Jones, crashing the lies.
[00:06:26.493 --> 00:06:28.893]  And we are in the danger zone.
[00:06:30.474 --> 00:06:32.354]  And Christ is our co-pilot.
[00:06:34.707 --> 00:06:35.428]  Tuesday, May 17, 2022.
[00:06:35.488 --> 00:06:37.009]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:40.792]  We're gonna be here for the next four hours.
[00:06:40.832 --> 00:06:44.295]  Nesta Souza and so many others are joining us today.
[00:06:44.355 --> 00:06:47.899]  This is a broadcast you are not going to want to miss.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:56.772]   There is no doubt that the pendulum is swinging from tyranny Back into liberty right now.
[00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:22.767]   It's at that magic moment where the pendulum seems to stop and now begin swinging back the other direction and the technocrats and their minions, all of these pedophiles and Satanists and control freaks who lust after power and control more than anything else, they are in absolute abject panic mode because they have figured out the fact that they are unable To suppress the new renaissance and where we're going.
[00:07:23.127 --> 00:07:24.988]  So say what you will about Elon Musk.
[00:07:25.049 --> 00:07:25.549]  Is he good?
[00:07:25.609 --> 00:07:26.149]  Is he bad?
[00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:29.232]  90% of what he does is spectacularly good.
[00:07:29.392 --> 00:07:31.073]  The other 10% is globalist.
[00:07:31.793 --> 00:07:33.615]  But is that him paying them lip service?
[00:07:33.715 --> 00:07:35.136]  Or is he paying us lip service?
[00:07:35.276 --> 00:07:57.291]   Regardless, the fact that he sounds more and more like Alex Jones every day, and that Joe Rogan sounds more and more like Alex Jones every day, and Tucker Carlson and all the rest, shows the world is getting it and understanding the real problem And what faces us, and folks know freedom is popular, and so Elon Musk has been particularly on fire in Fuego.
[00:07:58.803 --> 00:08:00.425]  So here are some incredible clips.
[00:08:00.465 --> 00:08:01.366]  I'll get into all the other news.
[00:08:01.386 --> 00:08:02.247]  There's so much today.
[00:08:02.847 --> 00:08:03.528]  We got to cover it all.
[00:08:03.588 --> 00:08:04.269]  It's too important.
[00:08:04.669 --> 00:08:09.454]  Here's Elon Musk saying that whoever controls Biden's teleprompter is president.
[00:08:09.714 --> 00:08:10.335]  And that's true.
[00:08:10.655 --> 00:08:11.436]  What the U.S.
[00:08:11.476 --> 00:08:15.660]  president says is one of the most powerful things, if not the most powerful on this planet.
[00:08:15.901 --> 00:08:16.641]  The world listens.
[00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:17.662]  Markets listen.
[00:08:18.203 --> 00:08:18.884]  Governments listen.
[00:08:20.362 --> 00:08:24.724]  A president can cause a depression overnight, or launch World War III, or get a great peace deal going.
[00:08:25.424 --> 00:08:42.492]  With Biden, it's a consortium of committees, with Obama, and the Rothschilds, and the Rockefellers, and the Carnegie Endowment, and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, with Obama captaining some things, and Biden does not know where he is, and has not known where he is for at least two years.
[00:08:42.792 --> 00:08:43.932]  That's why they ran him for president.
[00:08:46.493 --> 00:08:54.036]   That way he gets all the blame, And then the globalists get their takeover, their collapse of civilization they've been planning.
[00:08:54.697 --> 00:08:57.201]  So let's play this back to back, two spectacular clips.
[00:08:57.622 --> 00:09:03.551]  Elon Musk says that Biden is not really the president and that the real president is whoever controls the teleprompter.
[00:09:04.412 --> 00:09:08.374]  Musk went on to warn that the obvious cause of inflation might make the U.S.
[00:09:08.414 --> 00:09:09.254]  like Venezuela.
[00:09:09.274 --> 00:09:10.394]  It's the private central banks.
[00:09:11.055 --> 00:09:15.176]  And then Musk goes on to say he would reverse Trump's suspension from Twitter.
[00:09:15.576 --> 00:09:26.220]  And that ties into a senior engineer mad at Elon Musk, caught on tape by the incredible heroes at Project Veritas, saying, Twitter does not believe in free speech.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.161]  We are communist.
[00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:28.541]  F-freedom.
[00:09:30.282 --> 00:09:31.062]  Big megabanks.
[00:09:31.162 --> 00:09:32.022]  Big megatech.
[00:09:32.182 --> 00:09:33.043]  Rich engineers.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.841]  Hell, their engineers are paid millions of dollars.
[00:09:35.881 --> 00:09:36.961]  That's a mid-level job there.
[00:09:38.722 --> 00:09:39.423]  Millions of dollars a year.
[00:09:39.663 --> 00:09:40.583]  And they're communists.
[00:09:41.384 --> 00:09:41.584]  Yeah.
[00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:44.505]  That's why the owners of these companies pay almost no taxes.
[00:09:45.506 --> 00:09:47.367]  It's why they're waging war against poor people.
[00:09:47.387 --> 00:09:55.291]  And it's why the globalists that control the IMF and World Bank have ordered multiple year lockdowns that have killed over 40 million people in the third world.
[00:09:55.311 --> 00:10:01.054]  These are corporate fascist monsters saying they're avant-garde communists.
[00:10:01.154 --> 00:10:04.972]   It is beyond Mind control.
[00:10:04.992 --> 00:10:06.533]  It is beyond brainwashing.
[00:10:06.553 --> 00:10:07.673]  It is beyond gaslighting.
[00:10:07.993 --> 00:10:09.974]  It is just a sickening, disgusting fraud.
[00:10:10.214 --> 00:10:11.635]  They surveil us in live time.
[00:10:11.955 --> 00:10:13.415]  They steal our data in live time.
[00:10:13.455 --> 00:10:19.918]  They then censor us with that and then parade around that they're the moral high horses.
[00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:30.612]  With all their spokespersons saying America's evil and the average white person that works at a shoe store or a gas station is some evil mastermind.
[00:10:30.832 --> 00:10:38.221]  But the big multinational corporations and corporate owners of major basketball teams say screw the Uyghurs, 3 million in death camps.
[00:10:39.739 --> 00:10:40.320]  Screw them!
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.241]  I don't care about them.
[00:10:41.622 --> 00:10:43.564]  Oh, but you're Indian, so it's okay.
[00:10:44.045 --> 00:10:45.287]  Well, most Indians aren't like that.
[00:10:45.307 --> 00:10:47.049]  They care about what's happening to Uyghurs.
[00:10:47.089 --> 00:11:24.247]   But it's rich white people, rich Asians, rich black people, it's rich elite groups that are Anti-free market that want monopolies that are waging war on everyone and we need to recognize who they are a global criminal sickening cabal making statements of the Davos group like you'll have nothing you'll own nothing you'll like it your free will's over we're gonna depopulate you give up there's no hope the end of humanity is soon humans are no good these are quotes these are quotes I've played them here hundreds of times these people are raving out of control maniacs
[00:11:28.258 --> 00:11:29.139]  Unbelievable.
[00:11:29.239 --> 00:11:30.739]  So here is Elon Musk.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.921]  Man, it's hard to tell what Biden's doing if you're totally frank.
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:39.980]  [Laughter]
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:41.980]  It's weekend at Bernie's.
[00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:45.980]  The real president is whoever controls the teleprompter.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:51.980]   You know, it's like, it's like, the path to power is the path to the teleprompter.
[00:11:52.249 --> 00:11:54.830]  You know, like, what, because then he just reads the teleprompter.
[00:11:55.250 --> 00:12:01.792]  So, you know, I do feel like if somebody would accidentally lean on the teleprompter, it's going to be like Anchorman.
[00:12:01.852 --> 00:12:04.192]  It's going to be like QQQASDF123, you know, type of thing.
[00:12:07.713 --> 00:12:17.897]  I mean, in fairness to Biden, he hasn't been napping as much as he needs to, but... It's hard to sit at the feet where things are getting done, you know?
[00:12:17.917 --> 00:12:22.158]  I mean, this administration just doesn't seem to get a lot done.
[00:12:22.178 --> 00:12:32.541]  The Trump administration, leaving Trump aside, there were a lot of people in the administration who were effective at getting things done.
[00:12:34.642 --> 00:12:41.166]  This administration seems just to not have the drive to just get shit done.
[00:12:43.068 --> 00:12:45.209]  That's my impression.
[00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.652]  Now that's Elon being kind, and that's really not accurate.
[00:12:49.112 --> 00:12:51.013]  It's accurate about the teleprompter and that he's a puppet.
[00:12:51.193 --> 00:12:53.395]  Very powerful statement, but they're getting a lot done.
[00:12:53.415 --> 00:13:00.559]  Erasing our border, devaluing and annihilating our currency, brainwashing our children, turning the whole world against us.
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.121]  Destroying the blue cities they control.
[00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:05.604]  Creating record drug overdoses.
[00:13:06.144 --> 00:13:10.448]  Putting in policies all over the country where elementary students are expelled if they misgender someone.
[00:13:10.468 --> 00:13:11.689]  Talk about sexual harassment.
[00:13:11.909 --> 00:13:14.591]  This is a damn eugenics cult.
[00:13:15.512 --> 00:13:17.233]  They are getting a lot done.
[00:13:17.754 --> 00:13:18.614]  Screwing us over.
[00:13:18.654 --> 00:13:20.496]  Let's recognize he's just the front man.
[00:13:20.996 --> 00:13:26.121]  Now here's Musk warns what the obvious cause of inflation is that we're headed towards Venezuela.
[00:13:26.732 --> 00:13:34.514]  I mean, the obvious reason for inflation is that the government printed a zillion amount of more money than it had, obviously.
[00:13:34.373 --> 00:13:38.313]   but then he correlated that to taxing corporations and Bezos said this is
[00:13:38.313 --> 00:13:41.513]   misinformation and disinformation etc etc. What do you what do you think about
[00:13:41.513 --> 00:13:46.113]   that whole exchange then back and forth? I mean the obvious reason for inflation
[00:13:46.113 --> 00:13:49.153]   is that the government printed a zillion amount of more money than it had
[00:13:49.153 --> 00:13:57.873]   obviously. So it's like the government can't just you know have issued checks
[00:13:57.873 --> 00:14:02.953]  far in excess of revenue without there being inflation.
[00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:03.334]  Um, you know, velocity of money held constant.
[00:14:03.474 --> 00:14:09.556]  So unless there's something would change with velocity of money, but, but it's just the federal government writes checks.
[00:14:09.576 --> 00:14:10.557]  They don't, they never bounce.
[00:14:10.877 --> 00:14:13.958]  So that is effectively creation of more of more dollars.
[00:14:14.318 --> 00:14:22.602]  And if, if there are more dollars created, then the increase in the goods and services output of the economy, then you have inflation again, velocity of money held constant.
[00:14:23.082 --> 00:14:28.109]   Um, but so, uh, This is very basic.
[00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:31.973]  This is not like, you know, super complicated.
[00:14:31.993 --> 00:14:42.081]  And if the government could just issue mass amounts of money and deficits didn't matter, then why don't we just make the deficit 100 times bigger?
[00:14:43.979 --> 00:14:48.858]   Okay, the answer is you can't because it will basically turn the dollar into something that
[00:14:48.858 --> 00:14:52.219]  is worthless.
[00:14:52.219 --> 00:14:55.658]   And various countries have tried this experiment multiple times.
[00:14:55.658 --> 00:14:58.979]  It's not like, "Oh, I wonder what happens if this is done."
[00:14:58.979 --> 00:15:01.139]  Have you seen Venezuela?
[00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:08.119]   Like the poor people of Venezuela have been just run roughshod by their government.
[00:15:08.119 --> 00:15:12.698]  And so obviously you can't simply create money.
[00:15:12.698 --> 00:15:17.459]  The true economy is the output of goods and services.
[00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:19.698]  It's not money.
[00:15:19.698 --> 00:15:23.098]  It's literally what is the output of goods and services.
[00:15:23.098 --> 00:15:29.979]   Money is simply a way for us to, or anything that you call money, is a way for us to conveniently
[00:15:29.979 --> 00:15:34.738]   exchange goods and services without having to engage in barter and also to shift obligations
[00:15:34.738 --> 00:15:35.738]  in time.
[00:15:35.738 --> 00:15:39.899]   Those are the two reasons that you have money, this thing called money.
[00:15:39.899 --> 00:15:42.018]  It's really a database.
[00:15:42.018 --> 00:15:48.218]   Money is an information system for labor allocation and for exchange of goods and services and
[00:15:48.218 --> 00:15:50.057]  for translating in time.
[00:15:50.057 --> 00:15:54.498]   So Elon Musk has to sit there and explain to everyone what money is and on the panel
[00:15:54.498 --> 00:15:58.057]   is the owner of the Warriors that made the statement about not caring about the Uyghurs.
[00:15:58.057 --> 00:15:58.899]  (laughs)
[00:15:59.097 --> 00:16:03.639]  But remember, how many Democrats and globalists have said we have unlimited money, the federal government can spend all at once forever?
[00:16:04.099 --> 00:16:04.840]  None of it's true.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:08.541]  And now the very same Federal Reserve that did all this is now posing as our savior.
[00:16:08.561 --> 00:16:09.122]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:10.242 --> 00:16:16.625]  All right, next segment I've got just brutal financial news and what's happening with the worldwide design collapse.
[00:16:18.331 --> 00:16:24.313]  Also the situation in Ukraine and just the massive news Project Veritas undercover video.
[00:16:24.853 --> 00:16:27.394]  Senior engineer admitting we don't believe in free speech.
[00:16:27.994 --> 00:16:29.014]  We're effing communist.
[00:16:30.695 --> 00:16:31.435]  That's coming up.
[00:16:31.515 --> 00:16:36.256]  But I want to spend a few minutes here talking about what Elon Musk was just discussing.
[00:16:37.277 --> 00:16:42.038]  When I was 10 years old in school, they gave the same speech.
[00:16:44.111 --> 00:16:48.313]  In the fifth grade about what money is, it's a symbol of exchange.
[00:16:49.474 --> 00:17:02.820]  And hundreds of countries in the last 200 years have decided to devalue their currencies because their elites decided to do it, to buy up all their competition infrastructures and make the general public poor.
[00:17:04.585 --> 00:17:06.307]  That's why they've shipped our jobs overseas.
[00:17:06.367 --> 00:17:07.888]  It's why they've tried to destroy the work ethic.
[00:17:08.048 --> 00:17:15.715]  Everything is about getting you dependent so they can then social engineer you with the social credit score, universal basic income.
[00:17:16.776 --> 00:17:19.439]  And Elon Musk knows that as well.
[00:17:21.861 --> 00:17:22.702]  And that's where we are.
[00:17:23.783 --> 00:17:31.878]   And so when we talk about the currencies in the world, there's food, there's symbols of Exchange, which is money.
[00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:34.160]  There's information that's valuable.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.381]  There's art that's valuable.
[00:17:35.882 --> 00:17:37.523]  There are skills that are valuable.
[00:17:37.563 --> 00:17:39.405]  There's so many currencies.
[00:17:39.525 --> 00:17:46.591]  Goodwill and love and strength and courage are the most important currencies that God gave us, the gifts that God gave us.
[00:17:46.671 --> 00:17:51.716]  Our discernment, our free will, our conscience.
[00:17:53.197 --> 00:18:02.558]   And when you lose your conscience, when you harden your heart, When you lie to yourself and say you're disconnected from everybody else, you can do whatever you want, you destroy the civilization.
[00:18:03.518 --> 00:18:12.660]  I liken it to not just going to the local community pool and peeing in it, and everybody starts peeing in it, and now it's full of ammonia and burns your eyes, and they got to shut the pool down for a few days while they clean it up.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:19.922]  The globalists are defecating in the pool, in front of everyone, and telling us that it's Dutch chocolate ice cream.
[00:18:22.322 --> 00:18:24.143]  And so now the pool is a cesspool.
[00:18:24.203 --> 00:18:25.923]  It's a floating sewage dump.
[00:18:28.348 --> 00:18:31.190]  It's an open, stinking mess.
[00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.732]  And they're telling us that it's our fault this all happened.
[00:18:35.072 --> 00:18:41.676]  The private Federal Reserve is out there saying, oh, it's the current Federal Reserve's fault.
[00:18:42.376 --> 00:18:46.278]  They're now pointing fingers at each other when they've all been part of the same process.
[00:18:46.999 --> 00:18:52.402]  Obama's Fed Chairman, Ben Bernanke, now warning of coming stagflation under Biden.
[00:18:52.442 --> 00:18:53.502]  And what does stagflation do?
[00:18:53.522 --> 00:18:55.864]  They thought stagflation was impossible until the 70s.
[00:18:57.725 --> 00:19:01.688]  That's where you have less goods and services, but increasing prices.
[00:19:03.729 --> 00:19:05.391]  The perfect storm nightmare.
[00:19:05.411 --> 00:19:06.171]  So I'm going to say this.
[00:19:06.191 --> 00:19:07.672]  I'm going to be very, very clear.
[00:19:09.293 --> 00:19:10.775]  You have to value information.
[00:19:10.795 --> 00:19:12.576]  You have to decide what you value in this world.
[00:19:12.616 --> 00:19:13.777]  And I know things are getting tough.
[00:19:13.817 --> 00:19:15.958]  And I know the economy is designed to squeeze everybody.
[00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:19.281]  And even mainstream corporate media has been collapsing and going under.
[00:19:20.984 --> 00:19:23.966]  People want the truth, they want populism, they want Americana.
[00:19:24.266 --> 00:19:33.491]  These shows, despite the suppression, are still strong and still filling a vital role of giving people an understanding of what's happening to them that's beyond critical.
[00:19:34.932 --> 00:19:49.286]   But when I told you months ago, we can't offer the products at 50% off anymore, because the cost of what the products cost us to get high-quality, clean supplements have gone up, and the supply chains Broken down.
[00:19:50.087 --> 00:19:56.531]  We use four companies to produce our products, and the biggest one produces about eight of our products.
[00:19:57.031 --> 00:19:59.393]  It got bought out a year ago by a globalist company.
[00:19:59.973 --> 00:20:03.996]  Our terms of service are, pay 50% down, 50% when they're about to deliver.
[00:20:05.156 --> 00:20:15.123]  They held up 20 weeks, four of our best-selling products, just to give you an idea how the world's working right now, and then said, we don't care what the contract says, we want all the money up front now.
[00:20:17.557 --> 00:20:19.159]  And we're not going to do business with you after this.
[00:20:20.101 --> 00:20:20.461]  P.O.
[00:20:21.102 --> 00:20:21.643]  Purchase order.
[00:20:22.745 --> 00:20:26.971]  That's the attack America's under, and that's the attack we're under.
[00:20:27.011 --> 00:20:28.112]  So the products we have...
[00:20:29.605 --> 00:20:33.908]  When you go and change a formula because you can't even get ingredients anymore, you can't have the same name anymore.
[00:20:33.928 --> 00:20:37.851]  We may have to change a bunch of names of the products, not because they won't be as good, they might be better.
[00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:49.700]  It's just that we're having to go through a lot here because the country is breaking down, the world is breaking down, and it's happening at every level, whether it's concrete, or whether it's tile, or whether it's seeds, or whether it's fertilizer, everything.
[00:20:50.976 --> 00:20:53.677]  Is running scarce by design, and that's the catch-22.
[00:20:53.697 --> 00:21:00.480]  So when I offer X2 at 25% off, or Ultra 12 at 40% off, 40% off is like 60% off now.
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.622]  So everybody's habituated to buy the products and to wait till they get to 50%.
[00:21:05.142 --> 00:21:06.462]  We can't ever go past 30, 40%.
[00:21:08.922 --> 00:21:10.603]  So please, you need Ultra 12.
[00:21:10.683 --> 00:21:12.845]  It's the highest quality organic B12 taken out of the tongue.
[00:21:13.185 --> 00:21:16.368]  Methylcobalamin does amazing things for your whole body and your immune system.
[00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:21.752]  We have our new great immune boosting formula as well with the most concentrated high quality herbs.
[00:21:22.993 --> 00:21:32.060]  It's 25% off, but you can get Ultra 12 and X2 together for 40% off despite the fact X2 will go back to regular price next week and will sell out in the next couple weeks.
[00:21:33.086 --> 00:21:33.926]  We need your support.
[00:21:33.966 --> 00:21:35.907]  Plus, you really need X2.
[00:21:35.947 --> 00:21:37.148]  You really need Ultra 12.
[00:21:37.728 --> 00:21:40.390]  They're available in a combo, 40% off, InfoWareStore.com.
[00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.251]  Or Ultra 12, 40% by itself.
[00:21:42.651 --> 00:21:43.972]  Survival Shield, 25% off.
[00:21:44.272 --> 00:21:45.152]  And we need the funds.
[00:21:45.212 --> 00:21:46.453]  We barely got back in the black.
[00:21:46.933 --> 00:21:48.254]  People think, oh, he's back in the black.
[00:21:48.294 --> 00:21:49.274]  Suddenly, sales go down.
[00:21:49.314 --> 00:21:51.015]  We'll be back in the red in about a month.
[00:21:51.055 --> 00:21:54.174]   this continues. I did an hour of accounting and going over it this
[00:21:54.174 --> 00:21:56.774]   morning and I'm not bitching and complaining, but I need to be focused on
[00:21:56.774 --> 00:22:00.255]   news and information and our reporters. You know, Savannah Hernandez does some
[00:22:00.255 --> 00:22:04.494]   work with us, but she's gonna go via the rebel over to Debo's in a couple days to
[00:22:04.494 --> 00:22:09.295]   cover this big giant world government treaty and the UN treaty with Debo's to
[00:22:09.295 --> 00:22:15.254]  run it and we can't sponsor her to go.
[00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:14.851]  Thank God she found people to do it.
[00:22:14.931 --> 00:22:16.051]  She'll be here reporting with us.
[00:22:16.551 --> 00:22:18.492]  But that's... I'd love to send Christy Lee.
[00:22:18.612 --> 00:22:19.992]  I'd love to send Owen Schroyer.
[00:22:20.552 --> 00:22:22.333]  I don't have the money to send somebody to Switzerland.
[00:22:23.033 --> 00:22:24.733]  We used to be able to do that and cover everything.
[00:22:24.753 --> 00:22:26.654]  So that's how much we've cut back.
[00:22:26.714 --> 00:22:34.736]  And I gave millions away to other independent media organizations with no strings attached, to groups exposing child trafficking, never got the credit, didn't want the credit.
[00:22:36.576 --> 00:22:38.637]  Though we were given credit later when a film was made about it.
[00:22:39.778 --> 00:22:40.880]  That's what we've done here.
[00:22:41.601 --> 00:22:44.586]  And so I've sold my nice big house that I had as an investment.
[00:22:45.421 --> 00:22:50.383]  To put it back in the operation, I'm doing everything I can, and I thank you for your support, but you really need X2.
[00:22:50.803 --> 00:22:53.784]  You really need all these great products at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:22:53.824 --> 00:22:56.025]  And separately, we have a great sponsor.
[00:22:56.085 --> 00:22:58.206]  Without them, we wouldn't have made payroll the last few months.

[00:24:04.152 --> 00:24:07.633]  The right type of corporation to be in, the right type of tax shelter, the right type.
[00:24:08.474 --> 00:24:10.454]  Negotiate with the IRS to knock your bill down up to 90%.
[00:24:11.754 --> 00:24:13.354]  and penalties and interest knock it out.
[00:24:13.354 --> 00:24:19.633]   Just you need to go to jonestaxrelief.com or write down the number 833-900-4285.
[00:24:19.633 --> 00:24:23.273]   And it's the most important call you're gonna make when it comes during this inflation these times
[00:24:23.273 --> 00:24:26.273]   to use the same loopholes the establishment uses illegally and lawfully,
[00:24:26.273 --> 00:24:27.953]  not paying the private federal reserve.
[00:24:27.953 --> 00:24:36.154]   jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285 or infowarestore.com, 888-253-3139.
[00:24:36.154 --> 00:24:38.514]  Thank you so much for all your support.
[00:24:38.514 --> 00:24:44.793]   ♪ Get on the highway ♪ ♪ Looking for adventure ♪
[00:24:44.793 --> 00:24:50.234]   ♪ And whatever comes our way ♪ ♪ They explode into space ♪
[00:24:50.362 --> 00:24:52.643]  Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, staring into infinity.
[00:24:53.684 --> 00:24:56.727]  And I am very honored to be your host with so many of you tuning in today.
[00:24:56.747 --> 00:25:02.671]  All right, let's get into the real situation we're facing.
[00:25:02.751 --> 00:25:04.312]  It is unbelievable.
[00:25:04.352 --> 00:25:07.435]  Ahead of the next is joining us next hour.
[00:25:07.475 --> 00:25:08.736]  I mean, I really cannot.
[00:25:10.297 --> 00:25:11.298]  I really cannot.
[00:25:12.978 --> 00:25:15.500]  Under state or over state?
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:26.708]  I mean, I really just can't put words together how powerful 2000 Mules is and how conclusively proves how they stole the election and what they're planning to do again.
[00:25:26.788 --> 00:25:28.069]  So this is going to be very important.
[00:25:28.089 --> 00:25:33.212]  He'll have developments that have happened since the groundbreaking film came out, since millions have watched it.
[00:25:35.014 --> 00:25:37.956]  And films like this just scare the living hell out of the establishment.
[00:25:39.244 --> 00:25:42.006]  They've already brought in $45 million on the film.
[00:25:42.347 --> 00:25:43.508]  It cost a few million to make.
[00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:51.594]  And that, again, just scares Hollywood to death that independent populist media can just destroy the establishment.
[00:25:51.614 --> 00:25:54.137]  So, I mean, I am envious, but I'm glad they made this.
[00:25:54.857 --> 00:25:57.680]  And I just admire the work of the Dinesh D'Souza Show.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:59.781]  That is coming up in the next hour.
[00:25:59.841 --> 00:26:05.426]  We have another special guest that's putting together these big national tours with Flynn, who's incredibly smart and well-spoken.
[00:26:05.446 --> 00:26:07.288]  I'll tell you about that guest coming up as well.
[00:26:09.295 --> 00:26:11.357]  But right now, let's get into the cold, hard facts.
[00:26:11.577 --> 00:26:16.061]  And when I say this, I want it to really sink in so you take it personal, because it is personal.
[00:26:17.462 --> 00:26:19.103]  The globalists want to hurt you and your family.
[00:26:19.977 --> 00:26:22.057]  They want to bankrupt you so they can control your life.
[00:26:22.798 --> 00:26:24.178]  And they're doing a damn good job of it.
[00:26:24.618 --> 00:26:27.638]  And they're hurting us here, too.
[00:26:28.158 --> 00:26:37.360]  What they've done to Infowars is a mirror of what's happened to other American industries, because we have to have our own sponsors, 90% of the funding by selling products ourselves.
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:47.522]  And so I've been telling you, before it even happened, 26-27 months ago, that this would cause a worldwide supply chain breakdown, mass starvation, flooding the third world into the West, and now it's all happening.
[00:26:49.463 --> 00:26:59.127]  And it's only going to get worse unless we force a political action, the impeachment of Biden and any Democrats that back having the pipelines turned off and having the damn border open.
[00:26:59.307 --> 00:27:05.650]  Because those are two default tyrannical things where they've got their foot to our neck and are just bleeding us out.
[00:27:07.671 --> 00:27:10.352]  So there's not much time to mitigate this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:10.492 --> 00:27:11.813]  And so we're going to talk about it right now.
[00:27:13.268 --> 00:27:14.169]  Here's some of the headlines.
[00:27:14.789 --> 00:27:18.352]  Goya CEO issues dire warning on looming food crisis.
[00:27:19.053 --> 00:27:27.840]  He's one of the biggest canners of food on the planet, particularly beans and other vegetables, and he can't get them.
[00:27:29.602 --> 00:27:33.205]  So when the big dogs can't get stuff, you know there's a problem.
[00:27:35.026 --> 00:27:36.588]  This is total vertical integration.
[00:27:37.048 --> 00:27:41.452]  If it's hurting the big guys, it is going to kill, and I mean physically, a lot of people.
[00:27:42.964 --> 00:27:44.445]  Big article on Zero Hedge about that.
[00:27:44.465 --> 00:27:45.966]  We're posting it to InfoWars.com.
[00:27:46.066 --> 00:27:49.148]  Goya, CEO, issues dire warning on looming food crisis.
[00:27:50.369 --> 00:27:54.812]  California gas averages six plus dollars a gallon as prices across the U.S.
[00:27:55.192 --> 00:27:55.592]  surge.
[00:27:56.833 --> 00:27:59.094]  Don't worry, Bill Gates has got an answer to no baby formula.
[00:27:59.575 --> 00:28:01.136]  He's got an answer to all this.
[00:28:01.156 --> 00:28:03.337]  He's got genetically edited food.
[00:28:04.618 --> 00:28:06.079]  The next stage of their Great Reset.
[00:28:07.563 --> 00:28:12.946]  Oil prices rise as much as 3% and OPEC is defiant in not flooding market with supply.
[00:28:14.607 --> 00:28:16.007]  The squeeze is on.
[00:28:16.508 --> 00:28:23.351]  And that leads us on to this next big piece of information.
[00:28:23.431 --> 00:28:24.332]  These four stacks.
[00:28:25.285 --> 00:28:32.907]  California Rep Ted Lieu demands GOP denounce racist and vile replacement theory he once boasted about.
[00:28:32.927 --> 00:28:41.409]  The article on Infowars.com from Information Liberation has him where he was saying, we got to replace these bad Europeans with third world populations.
[00:28:41.449 --> 00:28:46.431]  And I'm not against having smart people that have skills coming here to America.
[00:28:46.471 --> 00:28:47.931]  That's what helps the country.
[00:28:48.732 --> 00:28:56.937]  But all the sociologists are on record knowing that if you bring in tens of millions a year, you cannot absorb that and it will break down society and drive down wages.
[00:28:57.917 --> 00:29:10.005]  So to counter that, Paul Watson's reposted Infowars.com and tweeted this out, a UN strategy document on the UN website from 2001, that's 21 years ago, says that replacement migration is needed to offset population decline.
[00:29:10.645 --> 00:29:16.509]  They said 600 plus million migrants needed in the US, up to 1.4 billion migrants needed in Europe by 2050.
[00:29:18.234 --> 00:29:18.775]  By the U.S.
[00:29:18.795 --> 00:29:18.895]  by 2040.
[00:29:19.015 --> 00:29:25.622]  Now, I'm the type of guy that actually shows you the document.
[00:29:27.243 --> 00:29:30.267]  Revealed UN plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[00:29:31.328 --> 00:29:32.789]  ArchiveinfoWars.com, 2018.
[00:29:34.091 --> 00:29:39.677]  Here's the actual executive summary from the United Nations website.
[00:29:39.737 --> 00:29:40.678]  It's linked on the articles.
[00:29:42.137 --> 00:29:50.124]  You need to go read this for yourself on the UN website.
[00:29:50.724 --> 00:30:00.793]  They're so lazy they killed the link to the main document but it's there in subsections and they lay out each country and how they're going to do it and how they're going to take it over.
[00:30:00.853 --> 00:30:07.959]  Here's Reitbart, Macron, Europe entering age of unprecedented mass migration, shares destiny with Africa, they want 200 million Africans in France alone.
[00:30:09.215 --> 00:30:09.855]  Revealed U.N.
[00:30:09.895 --> 00:30:11.856]  plan to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[00:30:12.597 --> 00:30:13.197]  There's the article.
[00:30:13.857 --> 00:30:14.918]  Newswars.com.
[00:30:15.938 --> 00:30:18.819]  And then they had a story in PolitiFact misleading.
[00:30:18.879 --> 00:30:20.000]  Infowars story says U.N.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:21.781]  plans to flood America with 600 million migrants.
[00:30:22.301 --> 00:30:24.802]  It goes on to say it's true, but the U.N.
[00:30:24.822 --> 00:30:26.723]  doesn't use the word flood, so it's not.
[00:30:28.544 --> 00:30:35.687]  And we have all the new video of the millions a month coming across the Texas border like clockwork, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:37.372 --> 00:31:00.994]  So that's their plan, that's their operation, that's what's going on, and they want you to be banned from being able to discuss the UN plan to collapse the third world in food shortages and starvation, flood the West, collapse the social welfare system via Clarence Piven's strategy, and then bring in a world ID as the answer.
[00:31:04.321 --> 00:31:05.922]  And the universal basic income.
[00:31:05.962 --> 00:31:09.184]  So, this was going around on Twitter yesterday.
[00:31:09.224 --> 00:31:10.505]  People asked me if it was real.
[00:31:12.686 --> 00:31:15.028]  And I sent them back the link that of course it's real.
[00:31:15.748 --> 00:31:17.249]  Air Canada and the Canadian government.
[00:31:17.369 --> 00:31:25.394]  Air Canada proudly presents a collaboration of Air Canada, the Canadian government, and the World Economic Forum for a new official ID program coming October 2022.
[00:31:25.754 --> 00:31:31.218]  You can now pre-order your digital ID this August with a new digital tracking system being implemented this October.
[00:31:31.738 --> 00:31:36.861]  The digital ID, facial recognition booths being put in Toronto, Pearson Airports, please call.
[00:31:37.401 --> 00:31:41.123]  You can get your digital ID and the government itself saying it's a pilot program.
[00:31:41.164 --> 00:31:50.729]  So is Italy and others for a forced world ID, carbon tax, social credit score, universal basic income tied to it and vaccine passport.
[00:31:51.349 --> 00:31:55.412]  Digital identity can help advance inclusive financial services.
[00:31:56.432 --> 00:31:59.034]  And it goes on from there.
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.341]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:32:03.541 --> 00:32:18.226]  And that ties in with all of the ongoing cub tyranny that we'll start getting to now but come back with more in the next segment in the Ukraine developments that are extremely important and the attacks on free speech and admissions that are just everything's bombshell from Project Veritas.
[00:32:18.246 --> 00:32:22.329]   They are the most Accomplished, incredible individuals.
[00:32:22.409 --> 00:32:25.112]  I just am just beside myself that I even know these people.
[00:32:26.474 --> 00:32:27.695]  I don't care about rock stars.
[00:32:27.735 --> 00:32:28.917]  I don't care about Hollywood.
[00:32:28.937 --> 00:32:32.040]  But I care about patriots that are turning the tide.
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:35.244]  And what they caught on undercover video is the greatest coup yet.
[00:32:35.604 --> 00:32:39.188]  But of course it's being blocked everywhere except places like Infowars.com.
[00:32:40.009 --> 00:32:40.810]  Hopefully you'll share it.
[00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:48.675]  And then that ties in to all the other big leaks and information that are coming out as well via Project Veritas.
[00:32:49.075 --> 00:32:50.496]  So that's coming up next segment.
[00:32:50.876 --> 00:32:58.876]   But please remember, the entire success of this operation to stop the globalist hinges on you
[00:32:58.876 --> 00:33:04.876]   and your word of mouth and your power with human intelligence to override the AI
[00:33:04.876 --> 00:33:07.996]   and override the sensors and say, hey, the truth lives.
[00:33:07.996 --> 00:33:09.395]  You wanna know about the food crisis?
[00:33:09.395 --> 00:33:10.235]  You wanna know about the open borders?
[00:33:10.235 --> 00:33:11.476]  You wanna know about inflation?
[00:33:11.476 --> 00:33:12.876]  You wanna know about the baby formula shortage?
[00:33:12.876 --> 00:33:15.496]  You wanna understand why they got drag queen pedophile time?
[00:33:15.496 --> 00:33:18.915]   You wanna understand why they're telling five-year-olds that they're gonna be expelled if they misgender people
[00:33:18.915 --> 00:33:20.116]  and there's 56 genders?
[00:33:20.116 --> 00:33:21.915]  You wanna know what the whole plan is?
[00:33:21.915 --> 00:33:25.116]   We have deciphered it and decoded it and know how to stop it.
[00:33:25.141 --> 00:33:27.181]  So tell people, hey, the truth lives.
[00:33:27.541 --> 00:33:29.802]  At the Vaughn, it demonized, attacked, and battled.
[00:33:31.222 --> 00:33:34.063]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, and Band.video.
[00:33:34.103 --> 00:33:42.285]  And the link to share that they're not censoring as much is Battleplan.news, which again takes you to Band.video.
[00:33:42.665 --> 00:33:47.006]  All right, we're going to go to break, come back with a news blitz, and then Dinesh D'Souza joins us.
[00:33:47.546 --> 00:33:50.627]  Please stay with us, my friends, and thanks to all of our affiliates.
[00:33:51.869 --> 00:33:52.810]  It's called feudalism.
[00:33:54.951 --> 00:33:57.993]  Neo-fascist feudalism is their system.
[00:33:58.793 --> 00:33:59.553]  All right, my friends.
[00:34:00.014 --> 00:34:02.035]  The National Citizen is coming up here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:34:02.075 --> 00:34:03.396]  Let's get into the news.
[00:34:04.409 --> 00:34:07.310]  And look, I've become somewhat numb to this.
[00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.590]  I know you have as well.
[00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:10.410]  It's how we overcome things.
[00:34:10.450 --> 00:34:12.251]  We just learn to deal with it.
[00:34:12.271 --> 00:34:18.132]  But the globalists hinge everything on you adapting to be a slave instead of adapting by overcoming.
[00:34:19.052 --> 00:34:23.093]  So you just have to consciously default this information and get it out.
[00:34:24.093 --> 00:34:29.674]  Because the general public still is oblivious to a great extent, though there is a major groundswell of awakening.
[00:34:31.032 --> 00:34:35.135]  They're targeting our children with a poisonous spike protein gene therapy.
[00:34:35.895 --> 00:34:40.038]  There are already hundreds of variants of the man-made COVID-19.
[00:34:40.218 --> 00:34:43.760]  It mutated to be more transmissible, but less lethal.
[00:34:43.821 --> 00:34:50.645]  And they're doing everything they can to still block therapeutics and everything they can to create a biomedical tyranny.
[00:34:52.086 --> 00:34:54.127]  They don't want to just abort children before they're born.
[00:34:54.147 --> 00:34:56.129]  They want to abort them after they're born.
[00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:57.249]  They want to abort all of us.
[00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:00.392]  That's what the New World Order is, is a human civilizational abortion.
[00:35:01.482 --> 00:35:02.562]  Here's CNBC.
[00:35:03.343 --> 00:35:09.224]  FDA authorizes Pfizer COVID booster dose for kids 5 to 11 years of age.
[00:35:10.365 --> 00:35:18.087]  Ted Gross, the head of the World Health Organization, complains misinformation leading to vaccine hesitancy as Biden coronavirus summit.
[00:35:18.747 --> 00:35:22.929]  But more countries like the UK are actually pulling their funding out of the World Health Organization.
[00:35:23.809 --> 00:35:32.173]  And putting it towards fighting the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative, realizing that this is all about a QIACOM takeover through the WHO and this new treaty.
[00:35:32.974 --> 00:35:41.818]  Top Australian doctor who pushes COVID-19 vaccine loses only daughter in her sleep after taking her third dose.
[00:35:43.099 --> 00:35:48.501]  Investigation launched amid second unusual spike in neonatal deaths in Scotland of vaccinated women.
[00:35:52.063 --> 00:35:57.545]   New Zealand Prime Minister Test positive for COVID-19 after having four shots.
[00:35:59.167 --> 00:36:00.888]  And it goes on from there.
[00:36:01.489 --> 00:36:03.650]  Here's signs, billboards up all over the UK.
[00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.131]  They're now pushing the same propaganda here.
[00:36:05.632 --> 00:36:11.076]  Get boosted now, and it shows an image of five batteries, one fully filled, and then the battery level going down to red.
[00:36:11.436 --> 00:36:13.478]  COVID vaccines lose power like batteries.
[00:36:13.958 --> 00:36:15.039]  Recharge your protection.
[00:36:15.379 --> 00:36:16.600]  They are not vaccines.
[00:36:17.401 --> 00:36:19.443]  And that is the UK government.
[00:36:20.222 --> 00:36:22.924]  Now we have the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morris on the pandemic treaty.
[00:36:23.464 --> 00:36:26.145]  The World Health Organization should have those powers and authorities.
[00:36:26.906 --> 00:36:27.826]  Talk about treason.
[00:36:28.467 --> 00:36:29.567]  It is happening.
[00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:32.609]  Continuing.
[00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:38.172]  White House admits it lied about vaccines, now admits they don't work, but you should still take them.
[00:36:39.633 --> 00:36:45.697]  Days after federal mask mandate lifted in air unruly passenger incidents plunge.
[00:36:46.758 --> 00:36:47.939]  He's not wearing gags anymore.
[00:36:48.319 --> 00:36:56.242]  Kim Jong-un health panic as explosive COVID outbreak in North Korea leaves six dead, oh my gosh, and 188,000 thrown in camps.
[00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:06.706]  Here we are matching up with authoritarian regimes with the UN COVID response.
[00:37:07.107 --> 00:37:10.848]  Over 160 billion in COVID unemployment benefits likely lost to fraud.
[00:37:12.469 --> 00:37:15.010]  And it goes on from there.
[00:37:16.325 --> 00:37:19.207]  Now let's move to military news here.
[00:37:19.748 --> 00:37:31.376]  Israel to simulate striking Iran in massive IDF drill and massive public drill on attacking and destroying military sites including nuclear sites across Iran.
[00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:39.903]  Iran says they will respond obviously with their Hezbollah brigades across the Middle East blocking the Strait of Hormuz and others.
[00:37:42.024 --> 00:37:45.507]  Now let's move on to the Russia situation.
[00:37:46.690 --> 00:37:58.096]  Senator McConnell expects Wednesday vote on 40 billion Ukraine aid, trying to unblock the block that the heroic Senator Rand Paul has put in place.
[00:37:58.156 --> 00:38:07.681]  Remember, the House only had the giant bill for two hours before they voted on it and passed it last week.
[00:38:08.301 --> 00:38:16.025]  Regime media refuses to call mass surrender of Azov fighters holed up in that big steel plant.
[00:38:16.664 --> 00:38:17.305]  A surrender?
[00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:27.855]  Swedish and Finnish leaders will visit White House as they seek to join NATO.
[00:38:28.436 --> 00:38:30.098]  Something Russia is calling a red line.
[00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.471]  And an act of war back to Maripol.
[00:38:33.891 --> 00:38:37.932]  The battle for Maripol nears an end as Ukraine declares combat mission over.
[00:38:38.232 --> 00:38:48.615]  So they're being kicked out, they're being defeated, and CNN spends it, and they spend it as combat mission is over after their troops got cornered and captured after a month-long siege.
[00:38:48.735 --> 00:38:51.196]  I mean, just next-level BS, folks.
[00:38:51.576 --> 00:38:51.756]  I mean...
[00:38:53.027 --> 00:38:57.252]  Unbelievable how they spend all this stuff, whether you're for the Ukrainians or neutral or for the Russians.
[00:38:57.953 --> 00:38:59.574]  The level of lying.
[00:38:59.715 --> 00:39:01.156]  Oh, everyone killed a snake island.
[00:39:01.216 --> 00:39:01.737]  No one killed.
[00:39:02.418 --> 00:39:05.201]  Oh, they're torturing people to death, but it's the Ukrainians doing it.
[00:39:05.641 --> 00:39:09.085]  And now $40 billion dumped in to that war zone.
[00:39:10.086 --> 00:39:10.687]  On top of it.
[00:39:11.327 --> 00:39:16.432]  Well, Elon Musk has come out and said the real president is whoever controls Biden's teleprompter.
[00:39:16.452 --> 00:39:17.272]  We already covered that.
[00:39:17.993 --> 00:39:19.834]  And now we have this incredible headline.
[00:39:19.874 --> 00:39:22.256]  Twitter does not believe in free speech, says senior engineer.
[00:39:22.597 --> 00:39:29.683]  Says we are all commies as F. And here is Project Veritas that caught the incredible footage.
[00:39:30.787 --> 00:39:32.787]  -Federer does not belong in the race.
[00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:34.787]  -What do you mean?
[00:39:34.787 --> 00:39:36.787]  -He's a capitalist.
[00:39:36.787 --> 00:39:38.787]  We weren't really operating in a capitalist mode.
[00:39:38.787 --> 00:39:42.787]   We weren't very socialist, but we're all like communist.
[00:39:42.787 --> 00:39:46.787]   -Ideologically, it doesn't make sense, like, because we're actually
[00:39:46.787 --> 00:39:48.787]  censoring the right, not the left.
[00:39:48.787 --> 00:39:52.787]   If everyone in the right wing would be like, "Bro, it's okay to say, just gotta tolerate it."
[00:39:52.787 --> 00:39:54.787]  -It's so true.
[00:39:54.787 --> 00:39:56.787]  -The left would be like, "No, I'm not gonna tolerate it.
[00:39:56.787 --> 00:39:58.787]  I need a censor."
[00:39:58.787 --> 00:40:00.787]  -I'm not gonna give a censor.
[00:40:00.787 --> 00:40:02.787]  -So it does double right.
[00:40:02.787 --> 00:40:04.787]  It's true.
[00:40:04.787 --> 00:40:08.787]   -But I don't know if the two parties can truly coexist on one platform.
[00:40:08.787 --> 00:40:10.787]  -What do your colleagues say about it?
[00:40:10.787 --> 00:40:11.787]  Thank you.
[00:40:11.884 --> 00:40:12.785]  They hate it.
[00:40:12.865 --> 00:40:13.345]  Oh my god.
[00:40:13.405 --> 00:40:19.188]  I'm at least like okay with it, but some of my colleagues are like super left, left, left, left, left.
[00:40:19.248 --> 00:40:21.409]  What do they say?
[00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:24.731]  They're like, this could be my last day if it happens.
[00:40:24.791 --> 00:40:27.993]  Has much changed since, like, A-Lan's coming out?
[00:40:28.293 --> 00:40:30.174]  A lot has changed.
[00:40:30.435 --> 00:40:31.415]  A lot has changed.
[00:40:31.555 --> 00:40:33.636]  We're all like worried for our jobs.
[00:40:33.656 --> 00:40:35.938]  Why are you guys so worried?
[00:40:36.958 --> 00:40:41.602]  I think it's just like the environment, like you're there and you become like this.
[00:40:41.622 --> 00:40:43.724]  You do it all because you like revolt against it.
[00:40:43.564 --> 00:40:45.564]  You can call my sister.
[00:40:45.564 --> 00:40:46.564]  You don't know.
[00:40:46.564 --> 00:40:48.564]  You know the only character that like revolted against it.
[00:40:48.564 --> 00:40:51.564]  A lot of employees revolted against it.
[00:40:51.564 --> 00:40:54.564]  But at the end of the day, board of directors have a say.
[00:40:54.564 --> 00:40:58.564]  And then they acted on their best interests.
[00:40:58.564 --> 00:41:00.564]  Because they didn't want to get sued.
[00:41:00.714 --> 00:41:06.656]  I basically went and worked like four hours a week for the last quarter, and that's how it works for a company.
[00:41:06.676 --> 00:41:07.056]  Yeah.
[00:41:07.216 --> 00:41:09.377]  How would you describe communism inside Twitter?
[00:41:09.457 --> 00:41:18.239]  Essentially, like, everyone gets to do whatever they want, but no one really cares about, like, politics, like capitalism, they care about how it works.
[00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:21.301]  I don't really care about how to make a business or a business.
[00:41:21.341 --> 00:41:24.322]  But in Twitter, it's like mental health is everything.
[00:41:24.382 --> 00:41:27.324]  Like if you're not feeling it, you can take a few days off.
[00:41:27.344 --> 00:41:29.285]  You can even take a month off, then come back.
[00:41:29.725 --> 00:41:31.566]  But you always have to do your best at any time.
[00:41:31.626 --> 00:41:32.246]  And that's culture.
[00:41:32.306 --> 00:41:35.928]  And, you know, we'll run the business as much as possible.
[00:41:35.988 --> 00:41:39.550]  Capitalists would be like, you gotta generate profit till you're out.
[00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.732]  A lot of people look at survival as culture.
[00:41:47.341 --> 00:42:14.245]  So what the globalists have done, and it's no fault of people that are the majority worldwide that have brown skin that have come to the United States, but the left goes out and these corporate leaders go out and pick women and minorities and say you have a chip on your shoulder, you've been wronged, we're going to go out and suppress the white people when all you're doing is suppressing the general public and free speech and you're owned by a bunch of giant tax-free criminal operations that launder money and surveil and censor everybody.
[00:42:16.084 --> 00:42:19.505]  Oh, we're commie as F-U-C, you know what?
[00:42:20.305 --> 00:42:22.146]  No, communism is bad enough.
[00:42:22.486 --> 00:42:29.648]  You are corporate fascists above the law that don't pay taxes who then surveil and censor everybody and run all your scams.
[00:42:29.688 --> 00:42:37.805]   And of course it came out that 90% of Hillary's Twitter stuff was fake.
[00:42:38.346 --> 00:42:39.488]  Were bots, her followers.
[00:42:39.528 --> 00:42:40.851]  And of course it came out with Obama.
[00:42:41.112 --> 00:42:44.339]  And of course it's come out that it's only 40-something percent with Biden, if you really believe that.
[00:42:44.579 --> 00:42:46.724]  But he has so few followers, I guess they didn't buy him any bots.
[00:42:48.362 --> 00:42:50.923]  So I said this a few weeks ago when Elon Musk was going to buy Twitter.
[00:42:50.943 --> 00:43:09.753]  I said, watch, he's doing this to be able to engage their books, show their fraud, and that half their people are bots, and that most of the echo chamber stuff you see is pre-programmed corporate and private and Twitter bots that create an echo chamber to gaslight people and basically a giant re-education cyberspace system.
[00:43:10.953 --> 00:43:12.814]  And that's how they do this and the documents have come out.
[00:43:12.834 --> 00:43:20.475]   So now he's like, well, I might still buy it now, but only for half the price, because, you know, it looks like half of its bots might be 90%, he said.
[00:43:20.975 --> 00:43:22.036]  Looks like it's about half bots.
[00:43:22.116 --> 00:43:24.158]  So, that's what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:24.798 --> 00:43:28.161]  CNN spent $300 million, couldn't even keep their CNN Plus on air.
[00:43:28.201 --> 00:43:28.841]  They're a fraud.
[00:43:28.881 --> 00:43:29.442]  They're over.
[00:43:29.762 --> 00:43:30.322]  They're done.
[00:43:30.342 --> 00:43:31.523]  Dinesh D'Souza coming up.
[00:43:31.343 --> 00:43:45.503]  up stay with us.

[00:44:09.114 --> 00:44:13.020]  It is the purest, highest quality atomic iodine you're going to find.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:20.309]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals and compounds so you don't absorb it at all or fully.
[00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:25.433]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a limited supply and it's been sold out for a month because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:44:25.934 --> 00:44:30.317]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week.
[00:44:30.337 --> 00:44:31.338]  Then it goes back to full price.
[00:44:31.718 --> 00:44:33.819]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.

[00:44:41.304 --> 00:44:44.304]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:44:44.304 --> 00:44:58.804]  If you can't find a space one--
[00:44:58.804 --> 00:45:01.804]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:01.804 --> 00:45:03.804]  Ready, set, go.
[00:45:03.804 --> 00:45:06.804]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:45:07.304 --> 00:45:10.304]  [APPLAUSE]
[00:45:10.304 --> 00:45:11.843]  All right.
[00:45:12.688 --> 00:45:16.351]  So, Donald Trump, how do you feel about coming to Austin, Texas?
[00:45:16.631 --> 00:45:20.574]  I'll tell you what, I love Austin, Texas because it's Austintacious, okay?
[00:45:20.795 --> 00:45:23.337]  This is a city that knows what it wants.
[00:45:23.677 --> 00:45:24.878]  It wants to be progressive.
[00:45:25.138 --> 00:45:26.299]  It wants to be out front.
[00:45:26.679 --> 00:45:31.283]  It wants to keep things real, lively, and that's what I love about MAGA.
[00:45:31.823 --> 00:45:39.169]  And of course, as you know, I am the Ultra MAGA King, so dubbed by our faux president, Joe Biden, okay?
[00:45:39.189 --> 00:45:40.130]  It's so fantastic.
[00:45:40.421 --> 00:45:43.644]  Today is special because you get to see Trump, but it's special for another reason.
[00:45:43.664 --> 00:45:44.265]  You want to tell me why?
[00:45:45.005 --> 00:45:48.429]  It's my birthday, and it's also the birthday of Israel.
[00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:49.770]  It's 74 years old.
[00:45:49.790 --> 00:45:50.931]  Alright, what's your name?
[00:45:51.411 --> 00:45:52.152]  Noble Jolly.
[00:45:52.773 --> 00:45:54.394]  And how old are you?
[00:45:54.414 --> 00:45:54.394]  13.
[00:45:54.434 --> 00:45:57.557]  Okay, and wow, you really pulled out all the stops.
[00:45:58.258 --> 00:45:59.839]  What gave you the idea to come like this?
[00:46:01.972 --> 00:46:07.735]  I got this costume a long time ago and I said if I ever go to a Trump rally, I'm going to wear this.
[00:46:07.775 --> 00:46:10.577]  He's a little bit more fun to watch than Sleepy Joe, right?
[00:46:10.977 --> 00:46:11.378]  Yes, ma'am.
[00:46:12.118 --> 00:46:14.359]  Why was it so important for you to make the trip?
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:18.522]  Because you fight for your freedoms and we don't want them taken away from us.
[00:46:19.302 --> 00:46:20.203]  And that's what's happening.
[00:46:20.843 --> 00:46:26.526]  Curious what you think of the military now that they have so many of the ideologies and things like that.
[00:46:27.707 --> 00:46:30.929]  Well, I think it's mostly their leadership that's the problem.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.041]  How do you think that we reach independence?
[00:46:33.121 --> 00:46:44.266]  Because so much has been about picking a team, Republican versus Democrat, but like things are just, you know, liberals now hate free speech, conservatives love it, which it didn't used to be that way.
[00:46:44.907 --> 00:46:47.428]  And you have a lot of just like evil versus good.
[00:46:47.508 --> 00:46:55.352]  How do you delineate and does your, are you more committed to like being Republican or does it, is it just more about what's right for America?
[00:46:55.694 --> 00:46:59.758]  Well, I'm a constitutional conservative, first and foremost, and I believe in America first.
[00:47:00.158 --> 00:47:02.720]  And I think that's what the majority of Americans are starting to feel.
[00:47:03.081 --> 00:47:04.942]  And I think that's how you reach the independents.
[00:47:05.042 --> 00:47:06.304]  I think that's what they feel, too.
[00:47:06.804 --> 00:47:07.805]  They just want America first.
[00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:09.727]  That's why they don't belong to one party or the other.
[00:47:10.247 --> 00:47:21.177]  And I think, whether it's a Democrat candidate or a Republican candidate, I just want candidates that are going to put America first in their policies, their decisions, and support the Constitution and freedom.
[00:47:21.755 --> 00:47:23.137]  We always look forward to your tweets.
[00:47:23.318 --> 00:47:25.281]  You know, the snarky, the humor, it's great.
[00:47:26.182 --> 00:47:32.072]  So what are your thoughts on this possible Elon Musk takeover and does that give you hope or do you have concern?
[00:47:32.489 --> 00:47:33.349]  No, no concern at all.
[00:47:33.369 --> 00:47:34.110]  I think the guy's great.
[00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:35.831]  I honestly don't know where he stands.
[00:47:35.871 --> 00:47:38.352]  I think Elon's probably exactly right down the middle.
[00:47:38.392 --> 00:47:40.493]  I think he's good on both sides.
[00:47:40.633 --> 00:47:42.854]  I think he's more good on the right side than the left side.
[00:47:43.294 --> 00:47:44.635]  But I love what he's doing.
[00:47:44.655 --> 00:47:46.316]  I love the fact that... I want to reach out to him.
[00:47:46.356 --> 00:47:47.136]  Elon, come on, dude.
[00:47:47.536 --> 00:47:48.977]  Let's make some good movies together.
[00:47:48.997 --> 00:47:51.478]  I do movies that would be chump change for you.
[00:47:52.078 --> 00:47:53.099]  You'll get your money back with me.
[00:47:53.139 --> 00:47:54.159]  I don't lose my investors' money.
[00:47:54.539 --> 00:47:55.760]  But I love what he's doing.
[00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.801]  I love the fact that he's...
[00:47:57.981 --> 00:48:00.203]  He's definitely not afraid to put himself out there.
[00:48:00.283 --> 00:48:01.704]  I was surprised he was on SNL.
[00:48:01.764 --> 00:48:04.946]  It's the first time I've ever watched SNL in probably 10 years, just to watch him.
[00:48:05.586 --> 00:48:07.808]  It kind of stopped being funny.
[00:48:07.828 --> 00:48:09.669]  It stopped being funny a long time ago.
[00:48:09.769 --> 00:48:14.552]  Time Magazine then named me Donald Trump's top pastor, so I'm honored with that title.
[00:48:15.072 --> 00:48:21.237]  I've just been preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ, but also the policies of the America First agenda led by President Donald Trump.
[00:48:21.257 --> 00:48:25.099]  So that's why it's important that black faces be real.
[00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:36.249]   When I say real faces, black faces, I mean Black people who have the spirit of our ancestors did, which was building and growing and not dividing and separating.
[00:48:36.389 --> 00:48:41.674]  Right now, that's kind of what's happening in America is that we are pushing that agenda of Dr. King away.
[00:48:41.954 --> 00:48:43.015]  The dream is dying.
[00:48:43.535 --> 00:48:51.763]  Where Dr. King said that people will be judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.
[00:48:51.603 --> 00:48:53.603]  where we're losing that.
[00:48:53.603 --> 00:49:01.603]  [applause]
[00:49:01.603 --> 00:49:03.603]  I'll tell you, he loves the country.
[00:49:03.275 --> 00:49:05.256]  You can see that, that enthusiasm for our country.
[00:49:05.296 --> 00:49:06.857]  That's what it's all about, right?
[00:49:06.957 --> 00:49:07.617]  Enthusiasm!
[00:49:07.637 --> 00:49:14.219]  There's nowhere, speaking of enthusiasm, like Texas.
[00:49:14.239 --> 00:49:14.759]  I love Texas.
[00:49:14.839 --> 00:49:23.001]  Remember, they said it's going to be a very close race in Texas.
[00:49:23.041 --> 00:49:24.922]  It's going to be very close, so...
[00:49:25.888 --> 00:49:27.029]  He's against God.
[00:49:27.490 --> 00:49:28.491]  He's against oil.
[00:49:28.551 --> 00:49:29.532]  He's against guns.
[00:49:29.612 --> 00:49:30.854]  And they said it was going to be close.
[00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:31.695]  I didn't think so.
[00:49:31.715 --> 00:49:32.516]  It wasn't close.
[00:49:33.457 --> 00:49:34.298]  I love that phrase.
[00:49:34.318 --> 00:49:35.439]  I use it a lot.
[00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:39.443]  But I'm thrilled to be back in the Lone Star State.
[00:49:41.706 --> 00:49:45.730]  Well, if I went over his bio, it would take us an hour, but he was...
[00:49:46.894 --> 00:49:49.736]  In the Reagan administration, did incredible work for America.
[00:49:49.756 --> 00:49:55.058]  He's an American success story that came to this country and knocked it out of the park.
[00:49:55.879 --> 00:49:57.420]  He has been a best-selling author.
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:03.623]  He has been a bigger filmmaker than really any documentary filmmaker out there in the last 50 years.
[00:50:03.683 --> 00:50:06.244]  The biggest numbers, the biggest gross.
[00:50:06.825 --> 00:50:09.026]  He really is a cultural icon.
[00:50:09.866 --> 00:50:12.268]  And that's why he was also a political prisoner.
[00:50:12.508 --> 00:50:16.070]  Absolutely framed in campaign finance for doing nothing wrong.
[00:50:17.691 --> 00:50:21.293]  And we saw the same thing with Rick Perry, charged when he vetoed a Democrat bill.
[00:50:21.774 --> 00:50:23.214]  Part of the law, the governor can veto a bill.
[00:50:23.495 --> 00:50:25.596]  The same group's trying to put me in jail right now.
[00:50:25.676 --> 00:50:28.117]  So he's a hero, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:28.218 --> 00:50:29.158]  Dinesh D'Souza.
[00:50:29.358 --> 00:50:37.103]  And if anybody's going to turn the tide, it's people like him and the folks, of course, like James O'Keefe that just keep dropping bombshell after bombshell.
[00:50:37.183 --> 00:50:39.324]  This is real investigative journalism.
[00:50:39.765 --> 00:50:41.045]  This is real filmmaking.
[00:50:41.406 --> 00:50:44.588]  I've watched 2,000 mules three times.
[00:50:45.842 --> 00:50:46.423]  Three times.
[00:50:47.223 --> 00:50:49.965]  And it is just smoking gun evidence of how they did it.
[00:50:50.606 --> 00:50:52.347]  They used the red herring of saying it was machines.
[00:50:52.407 --> 00:50:53.648]  We exposed it back at the time.
[00:50:53.708 --> 00:50:54.889]  No, it was the mules.
[00:50:55.469 --> 00:50:59.272]  They said the red wave was coming, the red mirage, but they would get the votes they needed.
[00:50:59.312 --> 00:51:05.164]   And now, a bunch of Democrat-controlled states have announced that they're going to allow ballots for
[00:51:05.164 --> 00:51:10.164]   seven days after the midterms to be mailed in. So this is their strategy. It's how they're
[00:51:10.164 --> 00:51:15.233]   doing it. Joining us the next 30 minutes or so is Dinesh D'Souza of 2000mules.com
[00:51:15.233 --> 00:51:16.713]  @DineshD'Souza on Twitter.
[00:51:16.713 --> 00:51:22.634]   Again, sir, I don't get starstruck by really anybody, but the work you've done for this
[00:51:22.634 --> 00:51:27.063]  country and my family and our culture and the world is unmeasurable.
[00:51:27.063 --> 00:51:33.394]   Thank you so much for not buckling under the pressure.
[00:51:33.291 --> 00:51:42.982]  And I also want to give a lot of credit here to the election intelligence group called True The Vote, because they provided the research foundation for this movie.
[00:51:43.022 --> 00:51:45.405]  They came to me and they said, we got to show you some stuff.
[00:51:45.885 --> 00:51:51.910]   I looked at it and I was like, I'm looking at A caliber of evidence I haven't seen before in this area.
[00:51:52.651 --> 00:51:58.254]  And I convinced them, I said, look, do not put this out in dribs and drabs because the left will swat you down.
[00:51:58.735 --> 00:52:01.316]  Let's put the whole story together in a movie.
[00:52:01.336 --> 00:52:05.439]  It's the appropriate intellectual and emotional venue to do this.
[00:52:05.899 --> 00:52:09.202]  And fortunately, they trusted me to unfurl this story.
[00:52:09.382 --> 00:52:14.365]  And boy, is the left having problems with this movie, which, by the way, is going into wide release.
[00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:17.549]  In theaters this coming weekend, Friday, May 20th.
[00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:20.393]  400 theaters, 4 showings a day.
[00:52:20.413 --> 00:52:23.878]  So, you know, you can go catch it in the theater this weekend.
[00:52:23.898 --> 00:52:24.238]  Please do.
[00:52:25.817 --> 00:52:33.947]  Absolutely incredible, and by any measurement, this is already a blockbuster, not just for a documentary, and it's only gaining steam.
[00:52:33.987 --> 00:52:39.433]  A massive first release, first online, then of course DVD, and now into theaters.
[00:52:40.194 --> 00:52:45.781]  Let's talk about the film, and then their response, and what's happened since it was released a few weeks ago.
[00:52:47.791 --> 00:52:59.856]  The left has unleashed a familiar battery of fact-checkers, and normally these are sort of, these are guys with truncheons, and they're normally capable of shutting any such venture down very quickly.
[00:53:00.636 --> 00:53:06.799]  Unproven allegations, blah blah blah, conspiracy theory, most secure election in history, big lie.
[00:53:07.219 --> 00:53:12.701]  But I think once they saw this film, and even from seeing the trailer, they realized that's not gonna work here.
[00:53:13.161 --> 00:53:22.593]  Because not only do we have electronic, which is to say, cell phone geo-tracking, which places the criminals at the scene of the crime, unmistakably.
[00:53:22.974 --> 00:53:29.122]  I mean, you can give your cell phone to your wife, but the fact that that cell phone was at that scene is not open to dispute.
[00:53:29.382 --> 00:53:30.724]  And then surveillance video!
[00:53:31.164 --> 00:53:32.385]  Four million minutes of it.
[00:53:32.425 --> 00:53:34.226]  We have a lot of this footage in the movie.
[00:53:34.606 --> 00:53:38.248]  So, you begin to realize the stupidity of the fact-checkers.
[00:53:38.289 --> 00:53:43.152]  Well, maybe, Dinesh, this is a guy who's taking the votes of his family members.
[00:53:43.512 --> 00:53:54.819]  And I'm like, well, okay, but would a normal person like that go to ten or more drop boxes in the middle of the night, wearing gloves, taking photos of the ballots as they go into the box?
[00:53:56.262 --> 00:53:57.826]  This makes absolutely no sense.
[00:53:57.886 --> 00:54:00.754]  So the left has got something here that they don't know how to handle.
[00:54:00.975 --> 00:54:03.502]  They're trying desperately to explain it and they cannot.
[00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:33.685]  And again, you guys, this company went out and was able to buy the data from the apps and the telephone companies that then shows how they went to the safe houses, the NGOs, how they then delivered them around the town, sometimes going to dozens of locations, then you're able to go get the surveillance footage that is at each location, actually show them doing it, taking the photo to prove that they did their job, then taking their gloves off, throwing it in the trash can, and they're just doing this in a very mechanized military fashion.
[00:54:35.399 --> 00:54:37.100]  Yeah, they're picking up these mules.
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:43.544]  The mule is just the paid operative who's delivering these illegal votes and is hired to do so by a left-wing organization.
[00:54:43.904 --> 00:54:45.865]  So they stop at these vote stash houses.
[00:54:45.925 --> 00:54:47.166]  That's where they get the ballots.
[00:54:47.206 --> 00:54:48.306]  They don't come up with their own.
[00:54:48.626 --> 00:54:51.128]  They're given a backpack or a satchel full of ballots.
[00:54:51.168 --> 00:54:55.790]  And by the way, they're instructed, don't go and drop all the ballots in one box.
[00:54:55.850 --> 00:54:56.110]  Why?
[00:54:56.130 --> 00:55:02.294]  Because if you go put 300 ballots in one box, the next day when the election officials open the boxes, there'll be a massive spike.
[00:55:02.734 --> 00:55:03.715]  And so they're instructed.
[00:55:03.775 --> 00:55:06.396]  Three ballots here, five ballots there, eight ballots here.
[00:55:06.716 --> 00:55:10.578]  And that's why the mules go on these routes to multiple drop boxes.
[00:55:11.279 --> 00:55:19.063]  And this is how it was actually, we found a way, just an ingenious way that True The Vote devised to bust them by tracking their phones.
[00:55:20.854 --> 00:55:24.915]  And as you said, the so-called fact checkers are apoplectic.
[00:55:24.955 --> 00:55:26.016]  They don't know what to do.
[00:55:26.076 --> 00:55:28.076]  This is open and shut information.
[00:55:28.336 --> 00:55:29.917]  But where's the Justice Department?
[00:55:29.957 --> 00:55:31.998]  Where's the FBI?
[00:55:32.018 --> 00:55:39.260]  We know that USPS drivers and others would find tens of thousands of ballots all pre-marked for Biden from one state to another.
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.240]  They thought it was suspicious.
[00:55:40.520 --> 00:55:41.941]  And then the FBI came and threatened them.
[00:55:43.587 --> 00:55:58.031]  Well, if you ask me where the Justice Department is, I would honestly say that they're probably trying to figure out ways that they can diffuse this story, because the Justice Department today should be understood as a kind of consigliere operation for the Mafia.
[00:55:58.331 --> 00:56:14.877]   In other words, what I'm getting at is if the evidence of the film is solid, which I believe it is, In effect, what we're saying is that the wrong guy's in the Oval Office, that Joe Biden is a usurper to the degree that it's illegal fraud organized by the left and by the Democrats to put him in office.
[00:56:15.297 --> 00:56:23.240]  And so his presence, Kamala Harris's presence, and obviously Merrick Garland's job are all based upon the success of that fraud.
[00:56:23.580 --> 00:56:30.223]  So what realistic expectation can we have that if we go to them, they're going to be the ones to crack down on the fraud that put them where they are?
[00:56:31.778 --> 00:56:32.398]  Incredible.
[00:56:33.599 --> 00:56:38.823]  How do you expect them to respond to this now that nothing they've said has worked so far?
[00:56:38.843 --> 00:56:40.624]  It seems like now they're just hoping it goes away.
[00:56:41.005 --> 00:56:43.006]  What are they going to do when it hits 400 theaters?
[00:56:43.086 --> 00:56:48.370]  I predict it'll sell out in most of them and then be in a thousand, two thousand theaters, meaning mega blockbuster.
[00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:52.253]  You've had those before and your other films were important, but my God, nothing compared to this.
[00:56:52.293 --> 00:56:55.255]  I mean, you've got to have a deep sense of satisfaction, Dinesh.
[00:56:56.932 --> 00:57:08.287]  Well, I really feel good because I was always dissatisfied with this mantra of it being the most secure election in history because I'd go up to people who'd say that and I would say, well, how do you know that?
[00:57:08.648 --> 00:57:10.811]  And they'd be like, well, where's your evidence, Dinesh?
[00:57:11.131 --> 00:57:16.856]   And I would say, well, Well, even if I had no evidence, it doesn't follow that this is the most secure election in history.
[00:57:17.176 --> 00:57:32.808]  In order for you to prove that, you've got to show me a comparison of the amount of fraud in 2020 compared to 2016, compared to 2012, compared to 2008 and 2004, and show me that there was the least fraud in this election to back up your claim that it's the most secure election.
[00:57:33.008 --> 00:57:36.991]  And then I realized, not only had no one done that, no one has even attempted it.
[00:57:37.351 --> 00:57:43.335]   So, there was always a kind of fragile pomposity behind this Most secure election in history.
[00:57:43.715 --> 00:57:44.276]  Nonsense.
[00:57:44.356 --> 00:57:48.038]  And now this film comes along and blows that completely out of the water.
[00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:57.083]  In fact, it blows the January 6th committee out of the water because their whole premise is that this was a secure election and anyone who says otherwise is perpetrating a big lie.
[00:57:57.323 --> 00:57:59.104]  It turns out that the guys who went to D.C.
[00:57:59.164 --> 00:58:06.208]  on January 6th, well, okay, maybe they shouldn't have gone to the Capitol, but in terms of their belief that this election was stolen, they were completely right.
[00:58:07.694 --> 00:58:14.181]  Dinesh, it is vital that everyone that has already seen the film go to the theater, take friends and family.
[00:58:14.701 --> 00:58:25.592]  If these 400 theaters sell out, for people that aren't a major filmmaker like you and don't know the inside baseball, explain to them that means it'll go on 1,100 screens, then 2,000 screens, and it'll be as big as Star Wars.
[00:58:25.672 --> 00:58:26.293]  That's what we need.
[00:58:27.557 --> 00:58:38.025]  We need the film to reach a tipping point where it breaks out into the culture so even independents and Democrats who are not all that political, they hear about it, everyone's talking about it, they're like, we better go check this out.
[00:58:38.345 --> 00:58:41.568]  I think that the ordinary Democrat who sees this film will be blown away.
[00:58:41.888 --> 00:58:43.409]  The left is trying to prevent that.
[00:58:43.449 --> 00:58:49.934]  There was a very telling headline in Mediaite just a few days ago, we've seen this film so you don't have to.
[00:58:50.114 --> 00:58:51.374]  And you can see what's going on there.
[00:58:51.634 --> 00:58:53.575]  They're trying to say to people, you don't need to see the film.
[00:58:53.855 --> 00:58:55.996]  Just read our critical review of it.
[00:58:56.036 --> 00:58:57.076]  That's all you need to know.
[00:58:57.596 --> 00:59:02.157]  Because the left is scared that their own side will see the film and go berserk.
[00:59:02.537 --> 00:59:06.998]  So this is a film which has great power, emotional as well as intellectual power.
[00:59:07.318 --> 00:59:08.239]  And you're absolutely right.
[00:59:08.279 --> 00:59:11.420]  The reason we're in 400 theaters is because the theaters came to us.
[00:59:11.880 --> 00:59:14.320]  They were like, you did a limited theatrical... Dinesh, stay there.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.141]  Dinesh D'Souza, American hero.
[00:59:16.161 --> 00:59:16.621]  Stay with us.
[00:59:17.441 --> 00:59:20.305]  America's priorities have been really screwed up.
[00:59:21.047 --> 00:59:23.670]  We care about professional sports people.
[00:59:23.691 --> 00:59:26.014]  We care about Hollywood when they're just puppets.
[00:59:26.074 --> 00:59:33.294]   But when it comes to somebody like Dinesh D'Souza, I mean, I can't gush enough because we were robbed In 2020.
[00:59:33.434 --> 00:59:34.954]  And we're going to be robbed again.
[00:59:34.974 --> 00:59:40.475]  And our country is being taken over and turning into Venezuela, as Elon Musk just said yesterday.
[00:59:41.116 --> 00:59:43.016]  And I know victory when I see it.
[00:59:43.136 --> 00:59:44.176]  I know truth when I see it.
[00:59:44.336 --> 00:59:45.136]  I know the research.
[00:59:45.516 --> 00:59:55.358]  This film, 2000 Mules, 2000mules.com, see it online, buy the DVD, is literally like penicillin to somebody that's got gangrene.
[00:59:57.259 --> 00:59:58.679]  It is so important.
[00:59:59.594 --> 01:00:03.278]  It's like somebody steals your car and then they find it.
[01:00:03.718 --> 01:00:04.840]  And the person that finds it, you love them.
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.201]  This is way more important to your car.
[01:00:06.501 --> 01:00:07.462]  It's our children's future.
[01:00:07.863 --> 01:00:12.267]  So the next decision, you're going to talk about how to release a film and do this in the age of censorship.
[01:00:12.287 --> 01:00:13.429]  You're an example to everybody.
[01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:16.051]  Next segment, this segment with eight minutes left.
[01:00:16.792 --> 01:00:19.795]  This film, the response, the different angles.
[01:00:19.815 --> 01:00:20.556]  You've got a lot to say.
[01:00:20.596 --> 01:00:21.998]  I could ask questions, but you've got the floor.
[01:00:23.772 --> 01:00:32.599]  Well, the left has been trying to put holes in the film, and they have really come up short on pretty much every front.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:43.968]  One tact that they've tried is the idea that, well, we have to assume that these are all legal votes that have merely been illegally delivered.
[01:00:44.389 --> 01:00:49.653]  But the fact that they are illegally delivered doesn't invalidate the votes themselves.
[01:00:49.753 --> 01:00:53.117]   Now, first of all, These are not legal votes.
[01:00:53.177 --> 01:01:04.489]  There is no way for hundreds of thousands of legal votes to mysteriously end up in the possession of a handful of left-wing inner-city organizations.
[01:01:04.749 --> 01:01:05.750]  How would that even happen?
[01:01:06.111 --> 01:01:10.616]  Are tens of thousands of people saying, well, you know what, it's too much trouble for me to go to a Dropbox?
[01:01:11.076 --> 01:01:19.778]  I'm just going to go to some left-wing organization and give them my filled-out ballot for them to hire a mule to deliver with gloves on in the middle of the night.
[01:01:19.798 --> 01:01:21.799]  I mean, this makes absolutely no sense.
[01:01:22.259 --> 01:01:40.283]  So, there's no plausible way for these legal votes to have ended up in the possession, by the way, of sometimes 501c3 or non-profit groups that are explicitly forbidden by the IRS to engage in partisan electioneering on behalf of any candidate or any party.
[01:01:40.743 --> 01:01:45.247]  So, this notion that there are legal votes illegally delivered is nonsense.
[01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:50.711]  But even if they were, once you pay mules, you have corrupted that vote.
[01:01:51.051 --> 01:01:59.318]  Even in states like California, which have very liberal vote harvesting laws, you're allowed to give your ballot, say, to your neighbor and say, you know what, you drop it off.
[01:01:59.778 --> 01:02:07.004]  But if I say to my neighbor in California, I'll give you my ballot and I'll pay you $10 to drop it off, that becomes a fraudulent vote.
[01:02:07.064 --> 01:02:07.765]  That's illegal.
[01:02:07.825 --> 01:02:09.026]  That vote cannot be counted.
[01:02:11.682 --> 01:02:35.848]   So incredible what are they going to do when it gets in 2000 movie screens which we know it's going to its blockbuster total truth what are they going to do I mean this is this is insane because as you know they're trying the same thing and all these battleground states again announcing that they're gonna do the same mail-in they're gonna they're passing laws for Five days, seven days after to pull the same scam to get whatever amount of votes they need.
[01:02:36.149 --> 01:02:43.252]  Like Nancy Pelosi said right before the elections, she said, there's a red mirage, it'll look like he wins, but we will have the mail-in votes after, and they did.
[01:02:45.225 --> 01:02:49.450]  Well, the left strategy can be... I have it down almost to a science.
[01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:53.054]  Their first strategy, try to prevent the message from getting out.
[01:02:53.274 --> 01:02:54.655]  That's their first... Ignore it!
[01:02:55.056 --> 01:02:59.281]  Don't say... Like the Hunter Biden story, let's all pretend that this movie doesn't exist.
[01:02:59.381 --> 01:03:02.965]  Now, that strategy is failing, and they actually know it's failing.
[01:03:03.545 --> 01:03:06.366]  So, their next strategy is fact-checking.
[01:03:06.546 --> 01:03:08.806]  So, what they'll do is they unleash these fact-checkers.
[01:03:09.106 --> 01:03:11.767]  And these, by the way, these are 20 and 30-somethings.
[01:03:12.067 --> 01:03:15.067]  They're writing about geotracking, a subject on which they know nothing.
[01:03:15.387 --> 01:03:16.788]  They're writing about election laws.
[01:03:17.148 --> 01:03:19.548]  Election laws are made, by the way, at the state level.
[01:03:19.588 --> 01:03:24.029]  So, there are different laws in Arizona, as there are in Georgia, as there are in Pennsylvania.
[01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:27.970]  So, these guys will come to me and say things like, well, you know, vote harvesting, Dinesh, is legal.
[01:03:28.050 --> 01:03:29.730]  And I go, is it legal in Georgia?
[01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:31.071]  Is it legal in Arizona?
[01:03:31.091 --> 01:03:32.931]  And they give me a blank look like, they don't know.
[01:03:33.431 --> 01:03:45.998]  So, even with geotracking, what they do is a typical fact checker will call around to one academic after another until he finds some guy who says, oh yeah, I have an article here from 2009 that says geotracking's not that reliable.
[01:03:46.238 --> 01:03:46.538]  Boom!
[01:03:46.838 --> 01:03:47.519]  That's their guy.
[01:03:47.739 --> 01:03:53.662]  They then quote this academic, this sociologist at Ball State University says that geotracking is unreliable.
[01:03:54.002 --> 01:03:58.004]  So, this is the intellectual caliber of opposition I'm dealing with.
[01:03:58.104 --> 01:04:04.448]  It's completely weightless intellectually, but what they're counting on is the ignorance of their own audience.
[01:04:04.468 --> 01:04:13.093]  They're counting on being able to tell people something that they don't know any better, and they go, oh yeah, the fact-checkers looked at this movie and they found it was very inadequate.
[01:04:13.732 --> 01:04:26.635]  Well, Dinesh, for those that don't know, and obviously you got one of the top companies, bought the data, it's all there, it's all crystal clear, any grand jury would indict these different NGOs that did this, and I guess that'll be the next phase for state grand juries and others.
[01:04:26.675 --> 01:04:28.595]  There's a lot of indictments happening right now already.
[01:04:28.815 --> 01:04:36.137]  This film, I predict, will break it all open, but everybody knows how a cruise missile works, or a precision guided munition out of artillery now.
[01:04:36.437 --> 01:04:45.800]   We're 30 miles away, the Pentagon, 35 miles away, they have a Howitzers that can hit a Jeep with ammunition and they're using GPS.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.220]  Well, it's GPS.
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:50.421]  So the general public's GPS is good down to five feet.
[01:04:50.881 --> 01:04:52.482]  The Pentagon's is down to about a foot.
[01:04:52.542 --> 01:04:56.423]  It's how they can, you know, shoot cruise missiles in the 90s down chimneys in Iraq.
[01:04:57.043 --> 01:05:00.985]  So the idea that this isn't real is preposterous.
[01:05:01.025 --> 01:05:04.526]  Everybody knows GPS is in their car and they know how damn accurate it is.
[01:05:06.013 --> 01:05:06.513]  Absolutely.
[01:05:06.533 --> 01:05:11.594]  Well, I mean, the CDC is using geotracking to verify if people are social distancing.
[01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:17.175]  So, if geotracking was not accurate to within six feet, how could you possibly do that?
[01:05:17.655 --> 01:05:25.136]  So, in case after case, whether it's the intelligence agencies, whether it's the FBI, in all kinds of ways we see.
[01:05:25.176 --> 01:05:31.137]  Chief Justice Roberts, by the way, reviewed the evidence on cell phone geotracking accuracy.
[01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:32.598]  He did this in the Carpenter case, 2018.
[01:05:33.258 --> 01:05:34.658]  It was a privacy case.
[01:05:35.058 --> 01:05:49.124]  But he said this, he goes, the accuracy of geotracking today is about as good as taking an ankle bracelet and affixing it to the ankle of a prisoner so that you can know, not their approximate, but their exact location.
[01:05:50.345 --> 01:05:50.965]  And that's it.
[01:05:51.065 --> 01:05:52.806]  And so the public gets this.
[01:05:52.826 --> 01:05:54.607]  They have no way around this.
[01:05:54.687 --> 01:05:58.829]  And as you quoted, partly Mahatma Gandhi said, first they ignore you.
[01:06:00.455 --> 01:06:03.604]  Then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then we win.
[01:06:04.146 --> 01:06:06.252]  And so we're at the attack point right now, aren't we?
[01:06:07.702 --> 01:06:13.006]  Yeah, so they launch a lot of ad hominem attacks and sort of, you know, Dinesh is a felon.
[01:06:13.426 --> 01:06:14.847]  First of all, I'm a former felon.
[01:06:14.867 --> 01:06:18.249]  I'm in that rare category of people who are former felons.
[01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:22.773]  Oh, Dinesh is trying to, you know, repay Trump because he got pardoned.
[01:06:23.133 --> 01:06:24.334]  All this kind of nonsense.
[01:06:24.374 --> 01:06:29.737]  Look, the evidence, the beauty of this movie is that the evidence for it is your own two eyes.
[01:06:30.058 --> 01:06:31.879]  This is the power of the surveillance video.
[01:06:31.899 --> 01:06:34.000]  Now, unhappily, there's not video everywhere.
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:36.142]  I wish there was video at every Dropbox.
[01:06:36.942 --> 01:06:38.904]  There's video only at a few Dropboxes.
[01:06:39.024 --> 01:06:42.366]  Now, so what happens is it's kind of like you got a serial killer.
[01:06:43.027 --> 01:06:46.309]  He goes from house to house to house and you have his DNA.
[01:06:46.329 --> 01:06:50.092]  Now in this case we're talking not about human DNA but digital DNA.
[01:06:50.452 --> 01:06:57.638]  Each of our cell phones has a unique ID that allows you to place the cell phone at the Dropbox and in this case at many Dropboxes.
[01:06:58.218 --> 01:07:00.880]  And then in some cases you have supporting video evidence.
[01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:03.122]  So the cell phone evidence shows that at 3 a.m.
[01:07:03.142 --> 01:07:08.907]  in the morning, let's just say on October 10th in early voting, the mule Dinesh D'Souza was at this drop box.
[01:07:09.268 --> 01:07:12.270]  You happen to have video, you go look on the video at 3 a.m.
[01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.690]  Boom!
[01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:13.311]  There's Dinesh.
[01:07:13.351 --> 01:07:13.971]  What's he doing?
[01:07:14.192 --> 01:07:16.674]  He's got a big backpack and he's stuffing ballots.
[01:07:17.154 --> 01:07:24.302]  So, the power of this is you have two independent types of evidence that come together to reinforce each other.
[01:07:24.322 --> 01:07:26.183]  Geolocating and the video.
[01:07:26.203 --> 01:07:27.645]  Dinesh D'Souza, unbelievable.
[01:07:27.685 --> 01:07:28.806]  Stay there, one more segment.
[01:07:29.287 --> 01:07:33.191]  We're going to talk about so much and we'll also expose something really important.
[01:07:33.211 --> 01:07:33.711]  Stay there, sir.
[01:07:34.612 --> 01:07:39.077]  Dinesh D'Souza, the greatest living documentary filmmakers with us live.
[01:07:40.461 --> 01:07:45.746]  He could be making documentaries about penguins at the level he's at, he'd be the number one guy.
[01:07:46.167 --> 01:07:50.671]  Number one viewers, number one gross, he belongs to America, he belongs to us.
[01:07:50.871 --> 01:07:52.232]  What a success story.
[01:07:53.015 --> 01:07:58.160]  Absolutely why we need the best brains of the world, especially places like India.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.182]  What an incredible American.
[01:08:00.522 --> 01:08:01.803]  We would be in so much trouble.
[01:08:02.223 --> 01:08:03.885]  I've been on there 27 years, folks.
[01:08:03.965 --> 01:08:05.086]  I know Dinesh's as well.
[01:08:05.607 --> 01:08:07.769]  And I cannot, again, compliment him enough.
[01:08:07.809 --> 01:08:09.290]  We need to celebrate our leaders.
[01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:13.474]  We need to celebrate our researchers and icons and out of everybody.
[01:08:15.222 --> 01:08:20.904]  Other than like Donald Trump when it comes to promoting America and really upsetting the globalist applecart of senentious citizen.
[01:08:20.984 --> 01:08:27.107]  I am just so happy to have him here with us for one more segment and very, very exciting about 2000mules.com.
[01:08:27.147 --> 01:08:32.789]  You need to go there, you need to watch it, you need to have your friends and family over, you need to have your company, if you're a boss, watch it.
[01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:36.311]  You need to get the DVD and you need to go see it in theaters.
[01:08:36.491 --> 01:08:36.751]  I know.
[01:08:36.891 --> 01:08:40.953]  I'm going to go see it for the fourth time when it hits theaters this weekend.
[01:08:41.173 --> 01:08:42.293]  My parents haven't seen it yet.
[01:08:42.954 --> 01:08:43.774]  I'm going to take them.
[01:08:44.214 --> 01:08:47.496]  This is an act of resistance and an act of celebration of the truth.
[01:08:47.936 --> 01:08:49.477]  This thing has victory written all over it.
[01:08:49.497 --> 01:08:51.117]  It's already over-the-top successful.
[01:08:51.418 --> 01:08:54.219]  So Dinesh, you wanted to encourage other independent filmmakers.
[01:08:54.739 --> 01:08:59.703]  And other people to understand there is a populist nationalist explosion not just here but worldwide.
[01:09:00.223 --> 01:09:14.934]  Hollywood's dead, Netflix is collapsing, CNN has collapsed and we have to go out and produce films and do shows and do podcasts and just simply keep doing it because they're censoring us because we have the truth and we're powerful and just keep moving forward.
[01:09:14.994 --> 01:09:19.517]  Folks have to understand as dark as things are that's because they're doing it out of weakness.
[01:09:19.817 --> 01:09:23.479]   Dinesh D'Souza as Again, the number one documentary filmmaker in the world.
[01:09:23.719 --> 01:09:25.679]  What is your advice to folks out there?
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:34.001]  Well, we had to develop a unique business plan for this movie because we couldn't do all the things we had done before.
[01:09:34.021 --> 01:09:38.623]  You can't advertise on Facebook, you can't advertise, you can't put the trailer up on YouTube.
[01:09:39.303 --> 01:09:42.004]  I didn't want to put this movie on Amazon Prime or iTunes.
[01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:42.204]  Why?
[01:09:42.224 --> 01:09:43.224]  Because they can take it down.
[01:09:43.284 --> 01:09:46.925]  I said, I'm only putting the movie on uncancellable platforms.
[01:09:47.859 --> 01:09:54.742]  So, the good news is that the big video platform named Rumble came to me and said, listen, what about if we partner together?
[01:09:54.762 --> 01:10:11.130]  We want to kind of go into the movie business and we want to show creators, conservative creators, yes, but any creators, people who make content, that you don't have to release the content where every time you make a dollar, somebody else gets 65 cents and you get 35 cents, which often makes your project unviable.
[01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:15.892]  So they said, what we'd like you to do is feature this film on our platform called Locals.
[01:10:16.712 --> 01:10:20.095]  You essentially offer it, we'll take 10% and you can keep 90.
[01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:26.161]  See, this is basically, I had to figure out a way to stay viable in the film business because I'm not a non-profit.
[01:10:26.201 --> 01:10:34.588]  What I mean is, I go to investors and I tell them, listen, give me money, give me $100,000, I'll work really hard in the market to try to get it back to you.
[01:10:34.688 --> 01:10:34.948]  Why?
[01:10:35.248 --> 01:10:37.831]  So that you can then give it to me again to make the next movie.
[01:10:38.111 --> 01:10:41.654]  So I call this, somewhat jokingly, I call it recycled philanthropy.
[01:10:41.854 --> 01:10:50.178]  Because what I'm trying to do is get a guy not to keep giving me $100,000 again and again, but to make the same $100,000 work in multiple movies.
[01:10:50.418 --> 01:10:52.799]  And I've got investors who've been with me for six movies.
[01:10:53.139 --> 01:10:53.319]  Why?
[01:10:53.339 --> 01:10:58.942]  Because I run their money around the block, I give it back to them, I show up the next day and take it back and put it into the next movie.
[01:10:59.802 --> 01:11:00.383]  Incredible.
[01:11:00.483 --> 01:11:12.208]   And if you go back to the Clinton archives from their museum in Little Rock, It was World Net Daily that sued 10 years ago and got the documents.
[01:11:12.828 --> 01:11:18.673]  As soon as they got in the White House, they said, we can't let conservatives and populists build their own media.
[01:11:19.014 --> 01:11:21.376]  They've got books, they've got VHS tapes now.
[01:11:21.856 --> 01:11:24.879]  If they build their own media, that's popular, they will defeat us.
[01:11:25.259 --> 01:11:26.820]  We've got to attack and go after that.
[01:11:26.860 --> 01:11:29.102]  Now we have the new Project Veritas video of the FBI.
[01:11:30.223 --> 01:11:37.366]  Whistleblower admitting that they're spying and attacking independent media and trying to put independent media leaders, conservatives, in jail.
[01:11:37.966 --> 01:11:44.709]  And again, you mentioned earlier, you're a felon for trying to get a few people to donate to your friend's Senate campaign for Hillary Clinton's seat.
[01:11:45.049 --> 01:11:48.790]  I mean, literally did nothing wrong, but that's what they do.
[01:11:49.090 --> 01:11:56.393]  So it's such apropos justice that here you are exposing real election fraud when they tried to destroy you for doing nothing.
[01:11:56.453 --> 01:11:57.914]  It's just it's bittersweet.
[01:11:59.315 --> 01:11:59.795]  Absolutely.
[01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:05.359]  When my case came up, I realized that if they were successful in destroying my career, then they would have won.
[01:12:05.439 --> 01:12:06.600]  That was really their goal.
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:10.583]  Their goal was, in terms of public influence, to like take me out.
[01:12:10.903 --> 01:12:11.924]  And they were really smug.
[01:12:11.944 --> 01:12:13.825]  They thought that they were going to be able to do that.
[01:12:13.926 --> 01:12:20.070]  So the fact that I've been able to have an even bigger career ever since and not lose my sense of fearlessness.
[01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:25.654]  In fact, on the contrary, I'm more than ever convinced that we're dealing with a gangster operation on the left.
[01:12:26.114 --> 01:12:33.256]  And so it becomes part of my goal to expose that in such a way that these people will be held to account and in fact will never recover.
[01:12:33.657 --> 01:12:34.317]  Well, that's right.
[01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:38.258]  And again, they tried to put George Washington and Thomas Jefferson in jail.
[01:12:38.638 --> 01:12:41.819]  And the fact that I've watched your trajectory since I was a little kid.
[01:12:41.839 --> 01:12:46.521]  My dad was a huge Reagan family when saw speeches on who you were when I was like, you know, 10 years old.
[01:12:47.381 --> 01:12:52.044]  The fact that you have persevered under all these attacks and I could see it.
[01:12:52.365 --> 01:12:56.748]  You got more effective, more powerful when they tried to silence you.
[01:12:56.788 --> 01:12:58.329]  You didn't take that attack and be a victim.
[01:12:58.369 --> 01:13:00.130]  You took that and you overcame.
[01:13:02.083 --> 01:13:04.424]  It outraged my basic sense of justice.
[01:13:04.464 --> 01:13:10.407]  In other words, my view at the beginning, and this comes out of the Reagan years, I thought, well, look, you know, this is an academic debate.
[01:13:10.747 --> 01:13:13.608]  You've got two sides that have different views of America.
[01:13:13.848 --> 01:13:17.570]  We put both them before the American people and the American people choose.
[01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:25.554]  It wasn't until I sat across from these kind of Obama Justice Department lawyers and I realized that that's not how they see me at all.
[01:13:25.594 --> 01:13:28.415]  They don't see me as a critic, someone who disagrees with them.
[01:13:28.855 --> 01:13:31.617]  They see me as an enemy that they need to destroy.
[01:13:31.637 --> 01:13:36.319]  If they could have locked me up for 20 years for that trivial violation, they would have done it.
[01:13:36.700 --> 01:13:38.381]  Because they play for keeps.
[01:13:38.441 --> 01:13:47.806]  I mean, these are ruthless characters, and I realize that we need a certain degree of tenacity and ruthlessness on our side just to be up to the challenge that we're facing from them.
[01:13:49.062 --> 01:14:05.214]  Well, when I talk to my four children, and I've told them this, I haven't told my five-year-old this yet, but I tell my son and my two older daughters, I said, Dinesh D'Souza and people like Donald Trump and people like, you know, the folks over at Project Veritas, James O'Keefe, I said, that's what you want to be like.
[01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:10.458]  Because, literally, it just makes me so proud to be an American.
[01:14:11.038 --> 01:14:13.020]  Let me ask you this, Dinesh, in closing, we've got three minutes left.
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:17.241]  Do you see, not just feel, the pendulum is swinging back?
[01:14:17.642 --> 01:14:20.843]  And if so, how do you think the deep state counters that?
[01:14:22.483 --> 01:14:34.468]  Well, I think what's happening is that the Republican Party, generally conservatives, are beginning to be fully aware of what they're up against, and they're getting much tougher.
[01:14:34.608 --> 01:14:37.149]  Now, the leadership hasn't kept suit.
[01:14:37.997 --> 01:14:48.947]  And the leadership is sort of being dragged, kicking and screaming into this kind of new Republican Party, which is not the same as the Republicans of the Reagan era.
[01:14:49.468 --> 01:14:54.833]  The deep state is very nervous about all this because ultimately this is what they're trying to block.
[01:14:54.953 --> 01:14:57.055]  This is what they're trying to contain.
[01:14:57.075 --> 01:14:58.837]  And they really can't do it.
[01:14:59.397 --> 01:15:02.300]  They think that they have the smartest people, but they're not smart enough.
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:05.702]  They think that they can control everything, but they actually can't.
[01:15:06.543 --> 01:15:10.405]  I think that at the end of the day, our future is in our own hands.
[01:15:10.466 --> 01:15:20.733]  Now, if the Republicans adopt the kind of, I call it, the wildebeest mentality, which is, in comes the lion and eats two wildebeests, and the others go, let me graze over here, so maybe I'll be the last guy to be eaten.
[01:15:21.253 --> 01:15:23.955]  If that's our philosophy, then we're going to lose in the end.
[01:15:24.375 --> 01:15:27.818]  But I don't think that's going to be our philosophy, even with the GOP.
[01:15:27.878 --> 01:15:37.465]  I think once Ted Cruz and Lindsey Graham and even the Republican establishment type see this movie, they may not, I don't know what they'll say, but they'll look at each other and they'll go, this is a problem.
[01:15:37.705 --> 01:15:38.286]  Well, you're right.
[01:15:38.346 --> 01:15:46.271]  And it gives courage to other people to tell the truth and give somebody true evidence instead of the courts during the election, after the election, blocking any real investigation.
[01:15:46.652 --> 01:15:53.217]  Finally, you've done one and it's, again, it's like giving water to a man in the desert who is dying of thirst.
[01:15:53.717 --> 01:16:14.987]  This is so incredibly important and I want the listeners to understand they need to go to 2000mules.com, they need to get the DVD and download the film and watch the film and make, plus you want to make people, it's an incredible film and I just know in closing with 45 seconds, I think it's a safe bet we're going to see some state grand juries come out of what you've done.
[01:16:16.468 --> 01:16:24.313]  Well, let's note that in Yuma, Arizona, in Yuma County, the sheriff watched the movie and opened up an immediate criminal investigation.
[01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:26.614]  He's looking at ballot trafficking in Yuma.
[01:16:26.654 --> 01:16:28.515]  Now, we interview a mule in the movie.
[01:16:29.036 --> 01:16:30.717]  She was busted for ballot trafficking.
[01:16:30.757 --> 01:16:32.198]  She's cooperating with the authorities.
[01:16:32.218 --> 01:16:33.639]  That's how we could get her in the film.
[01:16:34.059 --> 01:16:40.463]  And so that's the first sign, but it's an important sign that this film is going to have a real prosecutorial impact.
[01:16:40.823 --> 01:16:41.404]  Absolutely.
[01:16:41.984 --> 01:16:42.965]  2000mules.com.
[01:16:42.985 --> 01:16:45.347]  Dinesh D'Souza, thank you so much for the time.
[01:16:46.308 --> 01:16:50.791]  Once it comes out in theaters, please join us again, and again, we really salute everything you're doing.
[01:16:50.851 --> 01:16:52.253]  You are Americana.
[01:16:52.693 --> 01:16:55.355]  You're like the John Wayne of our modern times, and we appreciate you, brother.
[01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:57.337]  Thank you so much.
[01:16:57.577 --> 01:16:57.857]  Wow!
[01:16:58.898 --> 01:17:00.759]  Man, this film is incredible.
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.341]  It is cough and nails to the tyrants.
[01:17:02.741 --> 01:17:04.122]  This is so damn important.
[01:17:04.362 --> 01:17:06.504]  We'll be right back with big breaking news and so much more.
[01:17:06.824 --> 01:17:08.346]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[01:17:09.488 --> 01:17:10.429]  So what are they going to do?
[01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:20.375]  They're going to attack a minority church or college or grocery store, some type of minority gathering.
[01:17:20.615 --> 01:17:22.476]  Or a massive white supremacist attack they staged.
[01:17:22.797 --> 01:17:24.578]  That's all the pre-programming in the media.
[01:17:24.878 --> 01:17:25.899]  So you know what's coming.
[01:17:25.919 --> 01:17:29.121]  You're going to be bad because you were a Republican voter, period.
[01:17:29.541 --> 01:17:35.685]  That's how they intend to do this, is connect the Republican Party to white supremacism and the Second Amendment to it.
[01:17:35.845 --> 01:17:39.067]  That's why they're pushing for violence and preparing real false flags.
[01:17:39.387 --> 01:17:44.049]  Not just guys dressed up like white nationalists to discredit the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia.
[01:17:44.489 --> 01:17:45.650]  But violence, my friends.
[01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:55.035]  So if you go to a black church or you go to a rural, say, black grocery store, you better be packing.
[01:17:55.315 --> 01:17:56.235]  You better be watching.
[01:17:56.055 --> 01:18:14.375]  Because let me tell you, the deep states are coming.
[01:18:14.375 --> 01:18:15.454]  So what are they going to do?
[01:18:15.454 --> 01:18:25.454]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:18:16.970 --> 01:18:25.263]  They're going to attack a minority church or college or grocery store, some type of minority gathering.
[01:18:27.622 --> 01:18:38.770]  And they're either going to completely false flag it and do it 100% themselves, or they're going to find mentally ill, in-cell, white supremacist types that'll really be devil worshippers, whacked out of their minds on prescription and illegal drugs.
[01:18:39.291 --> 01:18:44.134]  There will be a two or three man idiot squad that'll go in and start shooting black people at a church.
[01:18:44.575 --> 01:18:51.580]  Then there'll be a backup team that'll kill them, claiming they committed suicide, who will then actually kill a couple hundred black people.
[01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:57.811]  Cause the Satanists always start shooting people and they kind of, wow, I'm actually killing somebody.
[01:18:58.111 --> 01:18:59.332]  This isn't as cool as I thought.
[01:18:59.732 --> 01:19:01.713]  And then they get killed by the black op team.
[01:19:01.734 --> 01:19:04.195]  The black op team then kills the lion's share of the people.
[01:19:04.475 --> 01:19:07.057]  They're going to want a big number, hundreds of dead black children.
[01:19:08.257 --> 01:19:15.342]  So if you go to a black church or you go to a, you know, rural, say black grocery store, you better.
[01:19:16.539 --> 01:19:17.080]  Be packing.
[01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:21.223]  You better be watching, because let me tell you, the deep states are coming.
[01:19:21.443 --> 01:19:26.608]  It's going to be the whole collapse of society, and you're going to be bad because you were a Republican voter, period.
[01:19:27.008 --> 01:19:33.193]  That's how they intend to do this, is connect the Republican Party to white supremism and the Second Amendment to it.
[01:19:33.434 --> 01:19:34.855]  That's how they plan to overturn it.
[01:19:35.095 --> 01:19:37.197]  That's the whole program you're seeing right now.
[01:19:37.417 --> 01:19:39.179]  But if the people are aware of it, it's over.
[01:19:39.499 --> 01:19:41.581]  This is the New World Order's revolution.
[01:19:41.881 --> 01:19:44.023]  This is an assault, and it only gets worse from here.
[01:19:45.558 --> 01:20:05.474]  And that's why no matter how much heat they get and how bad they look and no matter how much everything they do falls apart, they are moving towards staging massive terror attacks and other crises to blame their opposition and frame us for terror so they can move directly against us.
[01:20:05.494 --> 01:20:07.295]  They're going to try to launch a race war.
[01:20:07.315 --> 01:20:13.460]  They're going to pull off a false flag event, try to blame, of course, the gun owners and Trump supporters and Christians and so on.
[01:20:14.119 --> 01:20:19.462]  They will see if the people will comply to turn in their guns, which I believe people will not comply.
[01:20:19.482 --> 01:20:26.565]  That would be insane at this point, with the police being defunded and violent crime exploding, you know, all across liberal cities everywhere.
[01:20:26.605 --> 01:20:29.327]  People need self-defense more than ever, including, by the way, women!
[01:20:30.507 --> 01:20:37.306]   and people of color and also gays and lesbians and transgenders are buying guns more than ever
[01:20:37.306 --> 01:20:41.387]   before right now. So it's the left that's buying guns more than ever. So it's going to make gun
[01:20:41.387 --> 01:20:47.627]   control very difficult among left-wing legislators. So they're going to try to push a false flag and
[01:20:47.627 --> 01:20:53.147]   they're going to try to take the guns. If we, the American people, if we surrender our guns,
[01:20:53.147 --> 01:20:58.987]   I believe we will be invaded. They are planning, in my view, false flag terror attacks here in
[01:20:58.987 --> 01:21:01.787]  America to submit their rollout against us.
[01:21:01.789 --> 01:21:03.450]  Massive white supremacist attack they staged.
[01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:06.752]  That's all the pre-programming in the media so you know what's coming.
[01:21:06.812 --> 01:21:09.754]  They're pushing for violence and preparing real false flags.
[01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:14.737]  Not just guys dressed up like white nationalists to discredit the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Virginia.
[01:21:15.178 --> 01:21:16.338]  But violence, my friends.
[01:21:16.618 --> 01:21:20.261]  And that's why they're freaking out because that's the card they want to play.
[01:21:20.541 --> 01:21:21.882]  That's the point we've gotten to.
[01:21:26.255 --> 01:21:26.555]  All right.
[01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:29.278]  Here we are.
[01:21:29.778 --> 01:21:33.201]  Everything InfoWars is about, everything we do is about the truth and victory.
[01:21:34.642 --> 01:21:38.965]  The last 45 minutes with Anastasia was the essence of it.
[01:21:39.006 --> 01:21:41.568]  I mean, that's why I get so excited because you can smell it.
[01:21:41.628 --> 01:21:42.148]  I can smell it.
[01:21:42.168 --> 01:21:42.709]  We can see it.
[01:21:43.389 --> 01:21:45.050]  It's everything we look for.
[01:21:47.509 --> 01:21:55.096]  Now, InfoWars is a major battleship in the fight against the globalists and a platform to get information out they don't want out.
[01:21:55.396 --> 01:22:06.867]  And as their tyranny intensifies, no matter how bad the censorship is, if there's anything like InfoWars operating with millions of you watching and listening and taking action, we are unstoppable.
[01:22:08.228 --> 01:22:11.771]  And that's why they've got grand juries open trying to indict us for anything they can.
[01:22:12.588 --> 01:22:19.512]  They've moved on to the authoritarian mode of, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win, as Mahatma Gandhi said.
[01:22:19.992 --> 01:22:26.455]  I didn't bring up a Mahatma Gandhi quote, because that's as serious as India, and I use that quote all the time, because it's so true.
[01:22:28.016 --> 01:22:34.780]  Now we have a special guest joining us next hour, who's an amazing talk show host in his own right, Clay Clark, in Reawaken America Tour.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.681]  I've had a chance to speak at one of these, so has Owen.
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:45.723]  They've got Dr. Zelenko and Dr. David Martin and Charlie Kirk and Mel K speaking.
[01:22:46.223 --> 01:22:48.504]  We're not here to just promote this big event they've got.
[01:22:49.605 --> 01:22:55.027]  I've been invited to all these and I wish I could be at them, but I'm just tied down here trying to keep this vessel afloat.
[01:22:56.863 --> 01:23:04.047]  But he's gonna be on to talk about the whole New World Order, the UN Treaty, the Ukraine situation, the censorship, everything, next hour.
[01:23:04.067 --> 01:23:06.528]  And as I promised to do months ago, we've been fulfilling it.
[01:23:06.548 --> 01:23:08.229]  We've been taking a lot more calls.
[01:23:08.269 --> 01:23:14.072]  Now, I'm behind schedule a few months on launching a nighttime show three nights a week because, again, I'm not complaining.
[01:23:14.873 --> 01:23:21.757]  I have been running around like a chicken with my head cut off, trying to vet good sponsors, trying to get product.
[01:23:21.777 --> 01:23:26.331]   You know, I was Working with Dinesh, he's a great guy to give us a great deal on a bunch of his DVDs.
[01:23:26.351 --> 01:23:28.113]  You can get them from us and support both of us.
[01:23:28.794 --> 01:23:29.935]  But that's what I'm doing.
[01:23:30.876 --> 01:23:32.657]  I'll be up here until 5, 6, 7 tonight.
[01:23:33.138 --> 01:23:37.762]  Not doing news, not doing special reports, but jacking with getting money.
[01:23:37.783 --> 01:23:40.245]  Because I don't want to let this incredible crew go.
[01:23:40.645 --> 01:23:42.848]  I don't want to downsize in all this fight, so please.
[01:23:43.772 --> 01:23:52.314]  Realize it's your fight, it's your future, you're in a fight, and we're together in this fight, and we are the weapon, the sword of truth you're using to defend your family.
[01:23:52.595 --> 01:23:59.757]  And I want you to really have that go into your consciousness and ask, is M4 Wars the sword fighting for you and your family?
[01:24:00.257 --> 01:24:13.221]   Is M4 Wars dauntless and tireless and dogged and totally determined to demolish and decimate and dominate and Stop the New World Order.
[01:24:13.301 --> 01:24:15.322]  And the answer is, abso-frickin-lutely.
[01:24:15.882 --> 01:24:18.483]  So, I salute our affiliates and ask you to support them.
[01:24:18.984 --> 01:24:21.065]  I salute our sponsors and ask you to support them.
[01:24:21.405 --> 01:24:26.587]  And I salute you and ask you to realize, you need the products we have at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:24:26.907 --> 01:24:28.848]  They work like a charm.
[01:24:30.969 --> 01:24:32.450]  Take this product, and I'll get back to the nose.
[01:24:33.531 --> 01:24:34.031]  Alva Power.
[01:24:34.971 --> 01:24:38.113]  It's the highest rated versions of the herbs.
[01:24:39.414 --> 01:24:42.818]  They've not been radiated, they've not been boiled, they've not been, no, it's cold pressed.
[01:24:43.539 --> 01:24:51.470]  Known herbs and compounds that turbocharge your stamina, your energy, your focus, your libido, your immune system, everything.
[01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:57.136]   It's designed for men, works great for women, and It kicks in in about two days.
[01:24:57.356 --> 01:24:59.718]  First time you take it, doesn't have a big effect.
[01:24:59.798 --> 01:25:05.101]  Two or three days in, you will feel the effect for men when you wake up in the morning at 6 a.m.
[01:25:05.121 --> 01:25:07.122]  You're like, wow, am I 18 again?
[01:25:07.943 --> 01:25:09.123]  It's an amazing product.

[01:25:29.755 --> 01:25:30.395]  Here's another example.
[01:25:31.515 --> 01:25:36.997]  I've been selling super amazing quality coffee that people drink and go, my god, you said it was good but this is great.
[01:25:37.597 --> 01:25:40.538]  I started drinking coffee 15 years ago.
[01:25:42.298 --> 01:25:50.205]  That I got at the local HEB, local central market, that was from the Chiapas region of southern Mexico.
[01:25:50.225 --> 01:25:51.306]  And I said, I love this coffee.
[01:25:51.326 --> 01:25:51.886]  It's really strong.
[01:25:51.926 --> 01:25:52.427]  It's really good.
[01:25:52.447 --> 01:25:53.047]  It's really delicious.
[01:25:53.848 --> 01:25:56.650]  So I found out who was distributing it and got them as a distributor.
[01:25:57.311 --> 01:25:58.912]  And we've never gone up in price.
[01:25:59.993 --> 01:26:06.458]  Our coffee is about half the price of the same coffee sold at Whole Foods and other high-end grocery stores.
[01:26:07.355 --> 01:26:08.696]  We've got to go up in price.
[01:26:08.756 --> 01:26:14.820]  I did the math a few weeks ago and they said, yeah, boss, we're making about 26% on the coffee.
[01:26:15.420 --> 01:26:16.200]  You got to go up.
[01:26:16.441 --> 01:26:17.161]  It's inflation.
[01:26:17.881 --> 01:26:23.185]  So we sell a ton of coffee and a ton of stuff, but we're not making margins because of the inflation.
[01:26:23.225 --> 01:26:28.088]  So I said this like six months ago, and we did the math again last couple of weeks ago.
[01:26:28.368 --> 01:26:30.469]  We've got to go up on the price of the coffee 30, 40%.
[01:26:32.971 --> 01:26:34.872]  And it's just something I haven't done yet.
[01:26:35.572 --> 01:26:37.273]  But it's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:26:38.194 --> 01:26:38.994]  And I love the left.
[01:26:39.615 --> 01:26:42.496]  About three or four months ago, they did a big demonization piece.
[01:26:42.536 --> 01:26:43.597]  They go, Jones is a hypocrite.
[01:26:44.097 --> 01:26:48.880]  He says Chiapas communist rebels grow this natural harvested, but then he's a right winger.
[01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:53.283]  But they're the type of grassroots communists who are actually fighting the Mexican government and have their own communes.
[01:26:53.603 --> 01:26:55.244]  So I'm happy to support grassroots people.
[01:26:55.504 --> 01:26:56.545]  The point is this great coffee.
[01:26:56.605 --> 01:26:56.965]  I got it.
[01:26:57.005 --> 01:26:57.866]  It's got a crazy story.
[01:26:58.366 --> 01:27:01.288]  We sold seven times the amount of coffee.
[01:27:02.208 --> 01:27:04.629]  Since that went viral with tens of millions of views.
[01:27:04.689 --> 01:27:07.490]  So, the Lord works in mysterious ways.
[01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:12.391]  Get it all at InfoWarsTore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[01:27:13.652 --> 01:27:22.354]  All right, we're going to come back with our special guest, and we're going to knock it out of the park here today, and in the War Room at 3 p.m.
[01:27:22.394 --> 01:27:24.035]  Central with the great Owen Schroyer.
[01:27:23.855 --> 01:27:43.054]  Stay with us.
[01:27:43.075 --> 01:27:50.279]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:27:50.699 --> 01:27:52.901]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:27:53.661 --> 01:28:00.283]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsTore.com like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration and so much more.
[01:28:00.703 --> 01:28:13.847]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation so we get almost 100% of the money to fund our operation during this critical time, go to InfoWarsTore.com and right at the top you'll see a link to make a straight donation.
[01:28:13.867 --> 01:28:16.548]  A one-time donation of $5, $10, $50 or a recurring donation you can cancel anytime.
[01:28:19.969 --> 01:28:21.451]  I want to thank all you that have donated.
[01:28:21.491 --> 01:28:34.564]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support Freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countering the Great Reset by going to InfoWarsTore.com and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[01:28:34.944 --> 01:28:36.185]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:28:36.285 --> 01:28:36.966]  Please take action.
[01:28:38.107 --> 01:28:39.449]  It's called the Great Reset.
[01:28:40.249 --> 01:28:40.670]  Tough guy.
[01:28:41.903 --> 01:28:43.003]  It's called the New World Order.
[01:28:43.043 --> 01:28:53.046]  It's called the big banks wanting to squeeze the economy and make people poor so they can loan us fiat money to take control of our lives with a social credit score and a universal basic income.
[01:28:53.106 --> 01:28:54.147]  That's everything.
[01:28:54.427 --> 01:28:56.247]  That's the whole future of our lives.
[01:28:56.527 --> 01:29:01.789]  The whole world's going to be about surveillance and control and then manipulating and tracking everything you do.
[01:29:01.809 --> 01:29:03.330]  It's all being officially announced.
[01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:04.750]  I've got articles everywhere.
[01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:07.071]  There are press releases saying it.
[01:29:10.393 --> 01:29:12.956]  And then the crew asked me during the break, they go, Are you alright?
[01:29:13.056 --> 01:29:14.298]  You really seem upset.
[01:29:14.378 --> 01:29:16.761]  Are you feeling okay?
[01:29:16.781 --> 01:29:19.864]  They're gonna starve a couple hundred million people to death.
[01:29:19.884 --> 01:29:21.526]  Yeah, I'm pretty freaked out, yeah.
[01:29:21.566 --> 01:29:22.247]  This is real.
[01:29:22.648 --> 01:29:26.648]  This is not a freaking game to me, man.
[01:29:26.648 --> 01:29:28.648]  [MUSIC]
[01:29:28.648 --> 01:29:30.648]  You understand, I love you, man.
[01:29:30.648 --> 01:29:32.648]  I love you, man.
[01:29:32.648 --> 01:29:34.648]  [MUSIC]
[01:29:34.648 --> 01:29:37.648]   People are already starting to get hundreds of millions right now.
[01:29:38.658 --> 01:29:40.258]  You know, you never see it on the news.
[01:29:40.358 --> 01:29:41.679]  They're dying right now.
[01:29:41.699 --> 01:29:50.642]  They're in their freaking houses starving to death, begging for God's help, and no one's coming because God tells us to get up and take action, and then we don't do anything!
[01:29:50.982 --> 01:29:55.404]  And that paralyzes God!
[01:29:55.444 --> 01:29:56.324]  Yeah, God can do it.
[01:29:57.554 --> 01:30:00.856]  But God needs us to do it, because God's not free will.
[01:30:00.876 --> 01:30:06.278]  Once again, not for the first time, what had seemed like a nutty conspiracy theory, turned out to be the truth.
[01:30:06.619 --> 01:30:07.079]  Yeah, I'm upset.
[01:30:07.099 --> 01:30:08.540]  I'm really mad at you.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:10.901]  Last night, I was like, what's wrong with you?
[01:30:10.941 --> 01:30:11.581]  Really freaked out.
[01:30:11.601 --> 01:30:13.082]  I'm like, yeah, I'm really freaked out!
[01:30:13.742 --> 01:30:14.723]  I'm really freaked out!
[01:30:14.963 --> 01:30:16.404]  I'm really freaked out!
[01:30:16.464 --> 01:30:17.884]  You see, because this is real!
[01:30:18.665 --> 01:30:22.227]  The supply chain being cut off, the energy grid being cut off, it's real!
[01:30:25.390 --> 01:30:28.334]  And we're going into a time now where we're not going to be on the air.
[01:30:28.354 --> 01:30:35.623]  I mean, if we don't back this off, if we don't get sane people to stop the globalists, I mean, we won't be here in six months.
[01:30:35.443 --> 01:30:49.762]  Because you won't be here at 6/11.
[01:30:49.899 --> 01:30:50.960]  InfoWars.com.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.261]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[01:30:52.421 --> 01:30:53.822]  InfoWars.com.
[01:30:53.842 --> 01:30:54.663]  InfoWars.
[01:30:54.683 --> 01:30:55.664]  You watch InfoWars?
[01:30:55.864 --> 01:30:56.745]  InfoWars.
[01:30:56.765 --> 01:30:59.047]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[01:30:59.207 --> 01:31:00.368]  Alex Jones, nice guy.
[01:31:00.388 --> 01:31:02.930]  You must be a threat if they call you out by name.
[01:31:03.130 --> 01:31:03.691]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:05.392 --> 01:31:06.112]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:06.192 --> 01:31:06.852]  Alex Jones.
[01:31:06.932 --> 01:31:08.153]  Alex Jones is the greatest.
[01:31:08.193 --> 01:31:09.213]  He knows who InfoWars is.
[01:31:09.233 --> 01:31:10.433]  Quit playing this joke over here.
[01:31:10.613 --> 01:31:11.994]  That's why the de-platforming didn't work.
[01:31:12.114 --> 01:31:15.455]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:31:15.355 --> 01:31:18.355]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[01:31:18.355 --> 01:31:26.075]  It's never going to get any better.
[01:31:26.099 --> 01:31:27.239]  Don't look for it.
[01:31:27.639 --> 01:31:28.720]  Be happy with what you got.
[01:31:29.895 --> 01:31:32.938]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[01:31:33.498 --> 01:31:35.140]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.621]  The real owners.
[01:31:36.681 --> 01:31:41.205]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[01:31:41.586 --> 01:31:42.807]  Forget the politicians.
[01:31:43.027 --> 01:31:46.330]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[01:31:47.871 --> 01:31:48.292]  You don't.
[01:31:49.105 --> 01:31:50.086]  You have no choice.
[01:31:50.467 --> 01:31:51.388]  You have owners.
[01:31:51.688 --> 01:31:52.729]  They own you.
[01:31:53.970 --> 01:31:55.252]  They own everything.
[01:31:55.492 --> 01:31:57.134]  They own all the important land.
[01:31:57.494 --> 01:31:59.256]  They own and control the corporations.
[01:31:59.276 --> 01:32:02.760]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the state houses, the city halls.
[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:04.361]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[01:32:04.682 --> 01:32:09.507]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[01:32:09.707 --> 01:32:11.309]  They got you by the balls.
[01:32:12.799 --> 01:32:14.841]  They want obedient workers.
[01:32:15.281 --> 01:32:16.822]  Obedient workers.
[01:32:17.162 --> 01:32:29.831]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[01:32:29.911 --> 01:32:33.154]  And now, they're coming for your Social Security money.
[01:32:33.634 --> 01:32:36.276]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[01:32:37.717 --> 01:32:38.598]  It's a big club.
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.641]  And you ain't in it.
[01:32:40.661 --> 01:32:45.964]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[01:32:46.304 --> 01:32:47.185]  You better believe it.
[01:32:47.285 --> 01:32:49.166]  So what specifically did they do?
[01:32:49.606 --> 01:32:54.769]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand.
[01:32:54.789 --> 01:32:55.610]  A lot of money.
[01:32:56.230 --> 01:32:58.912]  You and I are not in the big club.
[01:32:59.292 --> 01:33:01.233]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[01:33:01.874 --> 01:33:05.576]  It's called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[01:33:06.991 --> 01:33:08.472]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[01:33:08.852 --> 01:33:12.355]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[01:33:12.375 --> 01:33:16.278]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[01:33:16.298 --> 01:33:17.258]  They're not interested in that.
[01:33:17.538 --> 01:33:18.479]  That doesn't help them.
[01:33:18.859 --> 01:33:20.240]  That's against their interest.
[01:33:20.741 --> 01:33:21.161]  That's right.
[01:33:21.421 --> 01:33:26.385]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:29.471 --> 01:33:33.800]  Well, I heard about this a couple years ago when they started it, but man, it is explosive.
[01:33:33.841 --> 01:33:39.813]  I've been to one of their events, 10,000 people, standing room only, and they're doing it multiple times a week.
[01:33:41.175 --> 01:33:47.019]  And they are giving voice to people that have been suppressed and dominated and it's going viral everywhere.
[01:33:47.740 --> 01:33:48.641]  And I love Victory.
[01:33:48.661 --> 01:33:50.382]  We had Ignatius on last hour.
[01:33:50.942 --> 01:33:52.904]  Clay Clark, Reawaken America Tour.
[01:33:53.344 --> 01:33:54.625]  General Flynn right at the heart of it.
[01:33:54.645 --> 01:33:56.247]  Dr. Zelenko, we love him so much.
[01:33:56.287 --> 01:34:00.150]  Dr. David Martin, Charlie Kirk, so many others.
[01:34:00.190 --> 01:34:09.417]  He joins us for the hour to talk about the waterfront and all that is going on and the Great Reset versus the Great Awakening.
[01:34:10.461 --> 01:34:17.644]  Revealing the 10 mind-blowing aspects of the nefarious surveillance under the skin transhumanism plan to enslave humanity.
[01:34:18.224 --> 01:34:21.985]  So, Clay Clark, thank you so much for being here.
[01:34:22.065 --> 01:34:23.186]  Thank you for taking time out.
[01:34:24.126 --> 01:34:28.268]  On Twitter, theclayclarkthrivetimeshow.com.
[01:34:28.828 --> 01:34:31.729]  Amazing talk show host, you're on the right, reaching millions a day.
[01:34:32.389 --> 01:34:34.850]  Brother, good to have you here.
[01:34:35.330 --> 01:34:39.012]  I sleep at night knowing that badasses like you are out there, brother.
[01:34:40.117 --> 01:34:40.958]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[01:34:41.358 --> 01:34:52.806]  If you would have told me three years ago that I would be talking to Alex Jones, Kash Patel, Dr. Zelenko, Eric Trump, General Flynn, and Oklahoma's Attorney General all within a 24-hour period of time, I would have thought you were crazy.
[01:34:52.826 --> 01:35:02.172]  But what's happening, Alex, is it turns out, at the last Reawaken America tour we had in Myrtle Beach, I bet you I saw 25 shirts that said Alex Jones was right.
[01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:09.452]  And I always thought that you were right, Alex, but what I didn't recognize was how right you were and how deep the swamp was.
[01:35:09.472 --> 01:35:18.574]  And so what I want to do on today's show is I want to drop at least 10 knowledge bombs that your listeners maybe did not know so you can wake up your family and friends today, because it's time to bang the gong.
[01:35:18.914 --> 01:35:23.475]  So knowledge bomb number one, Alex, if you want to wake up your family and friends, folks, look up HR6666.
[01:35:27.139 --> 01:35:27.780]  That's H.R.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:27.780]  6666.
[01:35:29.141 --> 01:35:31.002]  Look it up in Google or DuckDuckGo right now, folks.
[01:35:31.282 --> 01:35:39.468]  This is actual legislation that has actually been authored by the United States Congress that would allow the Secretary of Health to take you to a quarantine camp.
[01:35:40.009 --> 01:35:40.989]  Now, that is not a theory.
[01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:48.575]  That is an actual document, Alex, that you have been talking about what would happen, but now they have codified it, and it's just sitting there waiting to be passed.
[01:35:51.308 --> 01:35:51.869]  Incredible.
[01:35:52.591 --> 01:35:53.554]  And I've covered that bill.
[01:35:53.594 --> 01:35:54.537]  I even forget about it.
[01:35:54.978 --> 01:35:58.167]  That they have state bills and federal bills to put us in quarantine camps.
[01:35:58.588 --> 01:35:59.350]  Elaborate on that.
[01:36:00.399 --> 01:36:01.700]  Okay, so again, there's H.R.
[01:36:02.961 --> 01:36:10.806]  6666, which this will allow, again, elected officials, the Secretary of Health, to take you from your home and to force you into a quarantine camp.
[01:36:10.846 --> 01:36:12.748]  Now, knowledge bomb number two I want to share.
[01:36:12.768 --> 01:36:14.189]  I'm going to fire through a lot of them today, folks.
[01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:14.529]  Look it up.
[01:36:14.809 --> 01:36:17.111]  Type in CDC green zones, okay?
[01:36:17.371 --> 01:36:22.695]  The CDC has actually, if you go to DuckDuckGo or Google, they have actually created what they call green zones.
[01:36:23.394 --> 01:36:24.775]  And this is their recommendation.
[01:36:24.795 --> 01:36:34.984]  The Centers for Disease Control recommends that they would take you away from your home for a limited period of time, at least six months, to take you away to keep you from spreading the virus.
[01:36:35.125 --> 01:36:35.645]  So again, there's H.R.
[01:36:35.685 --> 01:36:36.326]  6666 that's been written.
[01:36:38.968 --> 01:36:43.794]  So virus is two weeks long maximum, but they want you to stay months in a prison.
[01:36:44.755 --> 01:36:51.123]  Remember Australia, they said if you complain about being in a camp, we'll keep you longer to make you stop complaining.
[01:36:51.443 --> 01:36:52.504]  It's all about control.
[01:36:52.765 --> 01:36:54.527]  It's the cover for their re-education camps.
[01:36:55.865 --> 01:36:56.386]  Exactly!
[01:36:56.426 --> 01:36:58.407]  So again, Knowledge Bomb 1, there's H.R.
[01:36:59.008 --> 01:36:58.407]  6666.
[01:36:59.348 --> 01:37:02.671]  If you're trying to wake somebody up, folks, say Google H.R.
[01:37:02.932 --> 01:37:05.574]  6666 and tell me what you think about that.
[01:37:05.814 --> 01:37:06.795]  Then you have green zones.
[01:37:06.855 --> 01:37:08.497]  It's called a CDC green zone.
[01:37:08.517 --> 01:37:09.297]  Everyone should look it up.
[01:37:09.718 --> 01:37:11.940]  Next piece of legislation we need to look up is called H.R.
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:11.940]  666.
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:13.461]  There's three sixes.
[01:37:14.322 --> 01:37:19.707]  This essentially is legislation that would say it's illegal for you to not agree with critical race theory.
[01:37:20.239 --> 01:37:21.559]  By the way, we're not joking.
[01:37:21.719 --> 01:37:26.101]  I don't want you to get into this, Clay Clark, but why are they keep putting 666?
[01:37:27.281 --> 01:37:28.462]  Is that to rub our nose in it?
[01:37:28.822 --> 01:37:29.722]  There it is on screen.
[01:37:30.342 --> 01:37:35.524]  Luciferians want to always show what they're going to do before they do it, okay?
[01:37:35.784 --> 01:37:38.405]  So another example, CERN, their logo is 666.
[01:37:38.585 --> 01:37:40.265]  I encourage everyone to look it up.
[01:37:40.325 --> 01:37:43.446]  CERN has what's called a Hadron Collider, okay?
[01:37:43.726 --> 01:37:45.167]  It's the world's largest computer.
[01:37:45.587 --> 01:37:53.369]  Elon Musk has said that he would like to use his company called The Boring Company to help these CERN folks make an even larger computer.
[01:37:53.809 --> 01:37:57.010]  CERN, for their grand opening, they actually had a satanic ritual.
[01:37:57.230 --> 01:38:02.691]  Folks, if you go to YouTube right now and type in CERN satanic ritual, you can see it.
[01:38:02.731 --> 01:38:04.512]  But CERN, their logo is 666.
[01:38:05.352 --> 01:38:07.552]  I'm going to keep going down the 666 trail for a minute.
[01:38:07.572 --> 01:38:13.034]  And it's people running around in black robes doing mock human sacrifices at the gateway to CERN.
[01:38:13.114 --> 01:38:14.174]  You are on fire, brother.
[01:38:15.086 --> 01:38:28.255]  Well, now if you type in W-O-2-0-2-0-0-6-0-6-0-6, Bill Gates has a patent, Microsoft has a patent for a cryptocurrency system that goes inside the human body that would literally fulfill the Book of Revelation.
[01:38:28.375 --> 01:38:30.997]  Now you say, Clay Clark, why are you so passionate?
[01:38:31.517 --> 01:38:44.607]   I am somebody who, I have read that Bible, I have read that Bible from cover to cover, and Alex, what I've discovered, Is the Bible, it says in Revelation chapter 13 verses 16 through 18, I'm going to read this to your listeners, because they deserve to have the actual scripture read to them.
[01:38:44.907 --> 01:38:57.514]  King James Version, it says, And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead, and that no man might buy or sell, say that he had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
[01:38:57.835 --> 01:38:58.575]  Here's the wisdom.
[01:38:59.221 --> 01:39:06.327]  Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred three score and six.
[01:39:06.747 --> 01:39:09.589]  The Bill Gates patent is W-O-2-0-2-0-0-6-0-6-0-6.
[01:39:10.150 --> 01:39:12.131]  So what am I saying?
[01:39:12.632 --> 01:39:21.419]  I'm saying that the Luciferians are diligent devils that want to put us in quarantine camps, and I'm asking for the Christians right now who are watching right now.
[01:39:21.819 --> 01:39:24.021]  I'm calling on you to get involved.
[01:39:24.341 --> 01:39:27.969]   It is the great reawakening Versus the Great Reset.
[01:39:28.489 --> 01:39:31.071]  I have done everything that I can do and I will continue doing it.
[01:39:31.351 --> 01:39:35.634]  At the peak of the lockdowns, I sued the mayor of Tulsa, Oklahoma to keep our city open.
[01:39:35.914 --> 01:39:37.895]  I converted my building that you see behind me.
[01:39:37.935 --> 01:39:41.978]  I turned my building into a church because the churches were locked down.
[01:39:42.298 --> 01:39:47.301]  And what I have found is that many Christians, not your listeners, but many Christians have been asleep at the wheel.
[01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:53.066]   Meanwhile, the Luciferians are diligently throwing out the number 666 And making their technology.
[01:39:53.086 --> 01:39:58.635]  And if you go to time2freeamerica.com forward slash revelation I have put the timeline there for you.
[01:39:58.995 --> 01:40:03.221]  So if you go to time2freeamerica.com Say it again, we're going to put it on screen right now when we come back from break.
[01:40:03.722 --> 01:40:05.004]  Man, you're on fire Clay Clark.
[01:40:05.084 --> 01:40:05.465]  Continue.
[01:40:06.423 --> 01:40:09.725]  It's time to freeamerica.com forward slash revelation.
[01:40:09.965 --> 01:40:18.268]  And you will see in 2002 the Centers for Disease Control patented the coronavirus transmissible to humans with patents number 7279327.
[01:40:18.789 --> 01:40:23.651]  In 2002 the CDC patented the coronavirus transmissible to humans with patent number 7279327.
[01:40:23.490 --> 01:40:29.750]   number 727-9327 and in 2008 the NIH Alex began research and how to block out the
[01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:37.601]   God gene which is called the VMAT2 gene They believe in God too, and they want to block the God gene.
[01:40:38.401 --> 01:40:40.563]  And no matter what they do, God will overpower.
[01:40:40.583 --> 01:40:41.124]  But you're right.
[01:40:41.224 --> 01:40:42.165]  We should rejoice.
[01:40:42.685 --> 01:40:46.489]  Revelation is being fulfilled right now, and what we're doing is getting people ready.
[01:40:46.769 --> 01:40:50.192]  When the Antichrist comes, there'll be the biggest revival ever, the Bible tells us.
[01:40:50.533 --> 01:40:51.694]  This is an incredible time.
[01:40:53.169 --> 01:41:10.249]  Alex, people from all over the country are coming to these events, and regardless of what the mainstream media says, and I'm not attacking anybody that makes a profit, I'm not attacking Charlie Kirk or Bill O'Reilly for hosting events, but for my events, my wife and I felt convicted that God was wanting us to do these events and to let people name their price.
[01:41:10.669 --> 01:41:14.572]  So if you're attending, my wife and I, we don't take any income or any salary from these events.
[01:41:14.933 --> 01:41:21.398]  We have folks like Dr. Zelenko, Dr. Rashid Batar, we have Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, Dr. Peter McCullough.
[01:41:21.698 --> 01:41:33.689]   Many of the big names that have only been allowed to share the truth on your program and Joe Rogan and other, which are now becoming mainstream programs, these people all speak Without censorship on the Reawaken America Tour.
[01:41:33.709 --> 01:41:35.811]  But I want everybody to be able to attend.
[01:41:35.831 --> 01:41:38.774]  So if you want to get a ticket, go to TimeToFreeAmerica.com.
[01:41:39.094 --> 01:41:40.455]  TimeToFreeAmerica.com.
[01:41:40.696 --> 01:41:46.902]  And if you mentioned that you heard about this, the event, through the Alex Jones Show, we're going to give you free access to our meet and greet.
[01:41:47.242 --> 01:41:49.364]  We'll actually give you an opportunity to meet some of the speakers.
[01:41:49.424 --> 01:41:52.507]  So again, go to time2freeamerica.com to claim your tickets.
[01:41:52.727 --> 01:41:56.150]  We're going to Virginia Beach in July and in August we're going to Rochester, New York.
[01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:56.751]  Why?
[01:41:56.971 --> 01:42:01.095]  Because General Flynn and Eric Trump want to take the Reawaken America Tour to New York.
[01:42:01.235 --> 01:42:02.536]  Into the belly of the beast, baby!
[01:42:04.144 --> 01:42:07.928]  Mike Clark, I've seen you on Owen, I've met you.
[01:42:07.988 --> 01:42:09.430]  You are on fire, brother.
[01:42:09.770 --> 01:42:11.933]  Is the pendulum not swinging back right now?
[01:42:12.253 --> 01:42:15.937]  Whether Elon Musk is good or bad, he gets that the public's awake.
[01:42:15.977 --> 01:42:17.159]  He's saying everything we're saying.
[01:42:17.199 --> 01:42:17.900]  This is incredible.
[01:42:19.312 --> 01:42:20.633]  I am seeing people wake up.
[01:42:20.773 --> 01:42:23.455]  Alex, when I get to the event, I always get there at 5 a.m.
[01:42:23.755 --> 01:42:26.136]  each day, and I try to meet as many people.
[01:42:26.196 --> 01:42:30.479]  So when we have, you know, 10,000 people that get in or 5,000 people, I want to shake all of their hands.
[01:42:30.519 --> 01:42:34.461]  And I did that symbolically for the first one because people were still afraid to shake hands.
[01:42:34.502 --> 01:42:36.963]  They were told they need to socially distance and wear a mask.
[01:42:37.003 --> 01:42:38.904]  And I said, I will shake every person's hand.
[01:42:38.924 --> 01:42:39.905]  You're breaking the will of their fear.
[01:42:41.264 --> 01:42:46.249]  Alex's people are discovering the Great Reset for the first time when I meet these people in line.
[01:42:46.269 --> 01:42:51.615]  I encourage everybody, go to time2freeamerica.com forward slash revelation to continue this conversation.
[01:42:51.635 --> 01:42:53.036]  All right, Clay Clark, unbelievable.
[01:42:53.096 --> 01:42:53.817]  Stay there, brother.
[01:42:53.937 --> 01:42:54.278]  Wow!
[01:42:55.865 --> 01:42:59.586]  All right, Clay Clark runs the Reawaken America Tour.
[01:42:59.686 --> 01:43:01.927]  He is a talk show host knocking it out of the park.
[01:43:02.467 --> 01:43:04.007]  He is on fire right now.
[01:43:04.467 --> 01:43:16.750]  As we go into the world government, as we go into transhumanism, as they announce in Italy and in Canada that you've got to have a Deimos Group ID to buy or sell or live, everything is happening.
[01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:22.232]  And the good news is, more and more mainline churches, Clay Clark, are actually talking about this now.
[01:43:23.253 --> 01:43:27.145]  As you said earlier, conservatives, populists, Christians are really waking up right now.
[01:43:28.214 --> 01:43:32.976]  Well, I just encourage everybody, you've got to understand there's the Great Reset versus the Great Reawakening.
[01:43:32.996 --> 01:43:34.837]  So I have a copy of the book, I wish I didn't, but I do.
[01:43:35.197 --> 01:43:37.158]  It's called COVID-19, The Great Reset.
[01:43:37.198 --> 01:43:42.520]  And COVID-19 is a book written by Klaus Schwab, the head of the World Economic Forum.
[01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:46.402]  And COVID-19 stands for Certificate of Vaccination, I-D-A-I.
[01:43:46.722 --> 01:43:49.163]  Certificate of Vaccination, I-D-A-I.
[01:43:49.403 --> 01:43:53.485]  So their plan is to put a Certificate of Vaccination, I-D-A-I, inside every single person.
[01:43:53.745 --> 01:43:59.508]   Now, if we go to time2freeamerica.com forward slash revelation, You can see that the patents prove the plan.
[01:43:59.868 --> 01:44:06.672]  So in 2002, the Centers for Disease Control patented the coronavirus transmissible to humans with patent number 7279327.
[01:44:07.153 --> 01:44:11.596]  In 2008, research began by the NIH on how to block out the God gene.
[01:44:11.616 --> 01:44:14.938]  So 2008, the NIH began research on how to block out the God gene.
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:28.426]  In 2010, as you've covered Alex, the Rockefeller plan was written, and on page 16 of this document, it calls for a world of tighter top-down government control and more authoritarian leadership.
[01:44:28.446 --> 01:44:35.491]  Now if we skip ahead to 2015, the system and method for testing for COVID-19 was actually patented.
[01:44:36.151 --> 01:44:36.391]  What?
[01:44:36.691 --> 01:44:40.834]  Yes, the system and method for testing for COVID-19 was actually patented in 2015.
[01:44:42.992 --> 01:44:51.341]  And then in 2015, check this out, Harvard's Charles Lieber, who was heavily financed by Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein, Charles Lieber, he created...
[01:44:52.339 --> 01:44:55.942]  Nanotechnology that uses 5G technology.
[01:44:56.162 --> 01:45:03.869]  He created patents that use again nanotechnology that goes inside the human body that can be activated via 5G.
[01:45:04.169 --> 01:45:09.934]  And if you don't believe me folks just go to time2freeamerica.com forward slash revelation and you can follow right along there.
[01:45:10.335 --> 01:45:11.556]  So what is this all about?
[01:45:11.596 --> 01:45:13.317]  At the end of the day what is all what is this all about?
[01:45:13.718 --> 01:45:21.382]   It's all about actually putting technology Inside your body that has the ability to control your thoughts.
[01:45:21.402 --> 01:45:22.822]  So I thought what I could do... So they own it.
[01:45:23.022 --> 01:45:27.304]  And the thing is, Harari and the World Economic Forum say you have no free will.
[01:45:27.684 --> 01:45:28.944]  We're taking your body over.
[01:45:29.284 --> 01:45:33.986]  The FDA last year approved nanotech of the food and said we're not even having a jurisdiction.
[01:45:34.086 --> 01:45:35.266]  This is their revolution.
[01:45:35.626 --> 01:45:36.827]  This is their covert war.
[01:45:36.887 --> 01:45:37.487]  It's happening now.
[01:45:38.567 --> 01:45:39.368]  You're 100% great.
[01:45:39.508 --> 01:45:39.988]  Now listen to this.
[01:45:40.008 --> 01:45:42.071]  This is Yuval Noah Harari saying it out loud.
[01:45:42.111 --> 01:45:45.394]  I'm going to try to get through 21 knowledge bombs in 20 minutes with Alex Jones.
[01:45:45.434 --> 01:45:45.874]  Can we do it?
[01:45:45.894 --> 01:45:49.778]  So this is Yuval Noah Harari saying out loud how the technology works.
[01:45:49.798 --> 01:45:51.400]  This is the top advisor for Klaus Schwab.
[01:45:51.440 --> 01:45:51.940]  Listen in, folks.
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:52.801]  Here we go.
[01:45:52.821 --> 01:45:59.668]  A good two-way communication system, direct communication system between brains and computers.
[01:46:00.088 --> 01:46:02.491]  This is kind of the watershed moment.
[01:46:03.163 --> 01:46:08.887]  I mean, once you have a good two-way, nobody has any idea what happens after that.
[01:46:08.987 --> 01:46:10.609]  He's saying it out loud!
[01:46:10.669 --> 01:46:15.192]  And he was asked during an interview, they said, how will COVID-19 change the future of the world?
[01:46:15.212 --> 01:46:16.113]  And this is what he says.
[01:46:16.153 --> 01:46:17.934]  This is not me saying this.
[01:46:17.974 --> 01:46:21.657]  This is, again, this is Yuval Noah Harari openly stating this.
[01:46:21.677 --> 01:46:22.818]  I'm going to play this audio clip.
[01:46:22.838 --> 01:46:27.782]  This is, again, the top advisor for Klaus Schwab, a man praised by Obama, Zuckerberg, and Gates.
[01:46:27.802 --> 01:46:28.622]  Listen to what he says.
[01:46:28.642 --> 01:46:30.624]  This is COVID-19, how he believes it should change the world.
[01:46:31.684 --> 01:46:42.767]  Ideally, the response to COVID should be the establishment of a global healthcare system, a basic healthcare system for the entire human race.
[01:46:43.287 --> 01:46:59.971]  And Alex, right now it's May 17th, and we are now just under 100 hours until the World Health Organization begins to assert its dominance over American sovereignty because of the actions taken by Joe Biden.
[01:47:02.176 --> 01:47:02.876]  It's incredible.
[01:47:02.916 --> 01:47:06.759]  We are living in the UN World Government Takeover.
[01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:10.200]  And... Correct.
[01:47:12.141 --> 01:47:12.662]  I will say this.
[01:47:12.742 --> 01:47:19.325]  Michelle Bachman, who's obviously not here with us today, but she's a very respectable voice, she chimed in on another program.
[01:47:19.345 --> 01:47:27.530]  I want you to listen to what Michelle Bachman said, because I think she articulated this urgent matter succinctly, but with a cool head and from a Christian perspective.
[01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:29.151]  Listen to Michelle Bachman explain what's happening.
[01:47:31.748 --> 01:47:34.729]  40 countries have already signed on, including the big guys.
[01:47:35.069 --> 01:47:42.011]  The EU, the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, the real countries.
[01:47:42.411 --> 01:47:46.432]  40 countries have already signed on, so presumably they already have the votes.
[01:47:46.813 --> 01:47:48.113]  So the vote will be taken.
[01:47:48.693 --> 01:47:55.176]  And then there's a six-month period before the actual vote becomes effective, and that's in November.
[01:47:55.576 --> 01:48:05.761]  And that's interesting timing, because no matter which party wins in the fall, presumably it won't matter, because this creates a platform for global governance.
[01:48:06.061 --> 01:48:10.383]  So Alex, there's an urgency, and I'm calling on every... Oh, they're going to bring in the new lockdown after the midterms.
[01:48:10.423 --> 01:48:10.983]  They admit that.
[01:48:12.270 --> 01:48:15.192]  I encourage everybody right now to open your Bible to Hebrews 10.25, okay?
[01:48:15.332 --> 01:48:16.853]  And I'm going to read this to you.
[01:48:16.873 --> 01:48:18.754]  This is why we're doing the Reawaken America Tour.
[01:48:19.094 --> 01:48:31.161]  It says, Hebrews 10.25, Alex, it says, "...not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another in so much more as ye see the day approaching."
[01:48:31.202 --> 01:48:31.842]  Let me translate.
[01:48:32.418 --> 01:48:42.785]  We should not stop getting together, as the manner of some is, but we need to exhort, to mentor, to encourage, to empower one another, and so much more as ye see the day approaching.
[01:48:43.105 --> 01:48:45.167]  We have got to activate, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:48:45.407 --> 01:48:51.111]  We are within, right now, we are within five days of America's sovereignty being over.
[01:48:51.611 --> 01:48:55.939]  It is now time for every single listener to go into Paul Revere mode.
[01:48:56.339 --> 01:49:02.590]  I need you to wake up your family and friends, get out the gong, go to timetofreeamerica.com forward slash revelation.
[01:49:03.496 --> 01:49:05.998]  Everything I've shared on today's show is cited.
[01:49:06.359 --> 01:49:07.640]  All the patents are there.
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:09.101]  It is spelled correctly.
[01:49:09.361 --> 01:49:10.102]  You can find it.
[01:49:10.142 --> 01:49:11.243]  The research has been done.
[01:49:11.523 --> 01:49:25.676]   Dr. Peter Bregan, Dr. Zelenko, Dr. McCullough, all my good friends I've met on the Reawaken America Tour, they've provided this information to me, and all I've done, Alex, is I've tried to break it down in a way that I can handle, because I'm an entrepreneur, I'm a former disc jockey.
[01:49:25.996 --> 01:49:26.797]  I am not a doctor.
[01:49:26.877 --> 01:49:27.717]  I am not a scientist.
[01:49:27.777 --> 01:49:30.059]  And I needed to break it down so that I could understand it.
[01:49:30.339 --> 01:49:32.861]  And that's what the Reawaken America Tour is all about, Alex.
[01:49:33.261 --> 01:49:34.222]  We start at 10 a.m.
[01:49:34.682 --> 01:49:35.963]  We go until 6 p.m.
[01:49:36.243 --> 01:49:37.444]  I don't think people realize this.
[01:49:37.464 --> 01:49:39.786]  We have 35 speakers per day.
[01:49:40.473 --> 01:49:45.616]  Including Eric Trump, Cash Patel, Donald J. Trump Jr., Zelenko.
[01:49:46.677 --> 01:49:48.778]  You spoke at one of the events we did in San Antonio.
[01:49:48.818 --> 01:49:49.859]  We've had Owen speak.
[01:49:50.099 --> 01:49:51.380]  We've had so many great speakers.
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:52.301]  Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[01:49:52.581 --> 01:50:00.566]  And the reason why we do this event, and the reason why I don't take a salary from these events, and the reason why our speakers are doing this, is because we want to save America.
[01:50:00.626 --> 01:50:04.334]   So I encourage all your listeners Go to time2freeamerica.com.
[01:50:04.354 --> 01:50:08.295]  We have under a thousand tickets remaining for the Virginia Beach Reawaken America Tour.
[01:50:08.555 --> 01:50:14.477]  And people are saying, Alex, this is the only place in the world that's allowing people to share this at scale.
[01:50:14.817 --> 01:50:19.719]  Oh, that's what's beautiful is you guys are selling out everywhere and you are on fire, Clay.
[01:50:20.019 --> 01:50:20.859]  It's all real.
[01:50:20.939 --> 01:50:21.599]  It's historic.
[01:50:21.659 --> 01:50:22.399]  It's happening now.
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:29.922]  Alex, I can't tell you how many people I ran into at the Reawaken America Tour in Myrtle Beach that had the shirts that said, Alex Jones was right.
[01:50:30.572 --> 01:50:32.514]  And I got to apologize to the listeners out there.
[01:50:32.534 --> 01:50:34.976]  You know, for years, I had listened to your program.
[01:50:35.076 --> 01:50:36.057]  I knew you were correct.
[01:50:36.337 --> 01:50:42.622]  But my wife, we were driving down the road and my wife asked me, she said, Clay, she said to me, she said, what are you going to tell your clients to do?
[01:50:42.682 --> 01:50:43.643]  I'm a business consultant.
[01:50:43.703 --> 01:50:44.464]  I own businesses.
[01:50:44.804 --> 01:50:48.107]  And she said, what are you going to tell your clients to do when they do a lockdown in America?
[01:50:48.607 --> 01:51:00.491]  And Alex, I never thought it would actually happen here, but once I saw Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx on the stage, I recognized that the Rockefeller plan was being implemented, and that President Donald J. Trump needed our help.
[01:51:00.811 --> 01:51:07.253]  I don't agree with him on everything he does, but I agree with President Trump on 95% of what he says, and President Trump needs our help.
[01:51:07.293 --> 01:51:08.194]  That's right.
[01:51:08.254 --> 01:51:09.014]  Clark, stay there.
[01:51:09.034 --> 01:51:09.714]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:10.935 --> 01:51:11.955]  Another world.
[01:51:14.276 --> 01:51:15.036]  Another time.
[01:51:16.673 --> 01:51:18.156]  In the age of wonder.
[01:51:22.525 --> 01:51:23.387]  Another world.
[01:51:24.830 --> 01:51:25.631]  Another time.
[01:51:28.226 --> 01:51:40.474]  The power of humanity is incredible, and Clay Clark, the dynamic businessman and talk show host, is leading the fight with General Flynn and others to take on the New World Order at point-blank range.
[01:51:40.494 --> 01:51:42.195]  Brother, I'm going to give you the floor for the rest of the hour.
[01:51:42.215 --> 01:51:43.636]  We've got two segments left.
[01:51:43.676 --> 01:51:44.716]  You've got the floor, brother.
[01:51:44.736 --> 01:51:49.039]  I mean, I've already followed you, I've met you, I watch you on Owen's show, but man, you've got to come back more.
[01:51:49.559 --> 01:51:50.480]  You are dead on.
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:51.440]  What are we facing?
[01:51:51.480 --> 01:51:51.961]  What do we do?
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:52:00.022]  Well, what we need to do right now is we need to gather the facts and we need to get out the gong, figuratively speaking, and wake up our family and friends.
[01:52:00.182 --> 01:52:07.343]  So we need to go to timetofreeamerica.com forward slash revelation and you need to just be able to share the truth with your family and friends.
[01:52:07.383 --> 01:52:12.384]  So what we're going to do is I want everyone to go to timetofreeamerica.com forward slash revelation and let's just skip down to 2015.
[01:52:12.424 --> 01:52:13.785]  You only covered like three of the points.
[01:52:13.845 --> 01:52:15.125]  I'm going to shut up and go over the 20 points.
[01:52:16.431 --> 01:52:17.031]  Yeah, let's do it.
[01:52:17.111 --> 01:52:17.792]  Okay, so we're going to 2015.
[01:52:17.932 --> 01:52:22.655]  All right, so let's just say you're sitting down with your cousin, your uncle, your daughter today, and you're trying to wake them up.
[01:52:23.156 --> 01:52:26.598]  You want to teach, if you're going to wake somebody up, you have to ask them questions rhetorically.
[01:52:26.878 --> 01:52:36.605]  So you want to say, hey, how come on October 13th, why on October 13th, why was the system and method for testing for COVID-19 patented on October 13th of 2015?
[01:52:38.326 --> 01:52:42.629]  October 13th of 2015, why was the system and method for testing for COVID-19 patented then?
[01:52:42.929 --> 01:52:43.990]  And just show the patent to them.
[01:52:44.921 --> 01:52:51.013]  And when they look at it, they're going to go, uh, wow, because all of a sudden we know that there's a plan.
[01:52:51.514 --> 01:52:51.755]  All right.
[01:52:51.775 --> 01:52:52.917]  So we have to start there.
[01:52:52.957 --> 01:52:53.899]  That's where we need to start.
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:53:02.791]   Now, in 2016, Peter Daszak, As an example, first of all, we're only looking at viral families that include those that have gone into people from animals.
[01:53:02.650 --> 01:53:08.251]   Peter Daszak openly said that he and his Chinese colleagues created viruses.
[01:53:08.251 --> 01:53:09.251]  So let's listen to this.
[01:53:09.251 --> 01:53:10.930]  This is Peter Daszak explaining how gain of function works.
[01:53:10.930 --> 01:53:18.010]   As an example, first of all, we're only looking at viral families that include those that
[01:53:18.010 --> 01:53:19.810]  have got into people from animals.
[01:53:19.810 --> 01:53:23.251]  So we narrow it down straight away.
[01:53:23.251 --> 01:53:28.570]   Then when you get a sequence of a virus and it looks like a relative of a known nasty
[01:53:28.570 --> 01:53:33.890]   pathogen, just like we did with SARS, we found other coronaviruses in bats, a whole host
[01:53:34.704 --> 01:53:37.046]  Some of them looked very similar to SARS.
[01:53:37.427 --> 01:53:42.070]  So we sequenced the spike protein, the protein that attaches to cells.
[01:53:42.851 --> 01:53:53.234]   Then we, well I didn't do this work, but my colleagues in China did the work, You create pseudoparticles, you insert the spike proteins from those viruses, see if they bind to human cells.
[01:53:53.754 --> 01:53:59.655]  And each step of this, you move closer and closer to this virus could really become pathogenic in people.
[01:54:00.095 --> 01:54:08.057]  So you narrow down the field, you reduce the cost, and you end up with a small number of viruses that really do look like killers.
[01:54:08.077 --> 01:54:23.032]   He openly just said, so again if you're asking your family, if you're trying to wake up your family and friends, ask them, why did Peter Daszak openly state In 2016, that he was involved with the Chinese to do gain-of-function research to increase the transmissibility of pathogens.
[01:54:23.232 --> 01:54:25.673]  So let me just explain how the whole Great Reset works briefly here, okay?
[01:54:25.953 --> 01:54:34.295]  The models that said that 2.2 million Americans would die from COVID... Alex, you know this and I know this, but the models that said that 2.2 million Americans would die from COVID, those were false.
[01:54:35.215 --> 01:54:35.315]  Two!
[01:54:36.061 --> 01:54:40.102]  The PCR tests, the COVID-19 tests, we're all supposed to go get tested.
[01:54:40.402 --> 01:54:44.403]  The COVID-19 tests were falsely calibrated to inflate the number of cases.
[01:54:44.423 --> 01:54:51.685]  And again, I'm trying to give you ammo because when you go and talk to your family and friends about a PCR test, they're going to go, what are you, a PCR testing expert?
[01:54:52.345 --> 01:54:52.906]  How do you know?
[01:54:53.066 --> 01:54:54.086]  Are you a scientist?
[01:54:54.406 --> 01:54:55.426]  So I'm going to play an audio clip.
[01:54:55.446 --> 01:54:57.567]  The inventor of PCR said it was fraud.
[01:54:58.652 --> 01:54:58.972]  Correct!
[01:54:59.032 --> 01:55:00.593]  And I've got all the clips right here for everybody.
[01:55:00.613 --> 01:55:08.217]  So I'm going to play this audio clip of the inventor of the PCR test, Kerry Mullis, explaining to you how the PCR tests work and how they shouldn't be used.
[01:55:08.237 --> 01:55:12.459]  Tony Fauci does not mind going on television and can lie directly into the camera.
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:17.562]  In the PCR, if you do it well, you can find almost anything in anybody.
[01:55:17.742 --> 01:55:26.739]  Because if you can amplify one single molecule, which PCR can do, there's just very few molecules that you don't have at least one single one of them in your body.
[01:55:26.779 --> 01:55:30.205]  So that could be thought of as a misuse of it just to claim that it's meaningful.
[01:55:31.224 --> 01:55:40.729]  So, again, Kerry Bullis openly states, I'm giving you all the ammo, so your listeners, again, folks, if you go to time2freeamerica.com forward slash revelation, you can have a sane conversation with family and friends.
[01:55:40.749 --> 01:55:41.609]  Now, I want people to understand this.
[01:55:41.969 --> 01:55:52.014]  March 26, 2020, Microsoft, Alex, they filed for a cryptocurrency system using body activity with patent number, as we mentioned earlier, W02020060606.
[01:55:52.174 --> 01:55:55.656]  Now, this is something that very few people know, and I'm going to blow someone's mind here.
[01:55:56.376 --> 01:55:59.338]  In 1971, that's the year that America got off the gold standard.
[01:55:59.478 --> 01:56:03.541]  Richard Nixon got us off the gold standard per the recommendation of Henry Kissinger in 1971.
[01:56:05.201 --> 01:56:09.064]  In 1971, Klaus Schwab started the World Economic Forum.
[01:56:09.104 --> 01:56:15.808]  The author of COVID-19, The Great Reset, Klaus Schwab started the World Economic Forum in 1971 per the recommendation of Henry Kissinger.
[01:56:16.288 --> 01:56:20.571]  Folks, did you know that in 1971, there was a comic that was created in 1971 called Dark Seed?
[01:56:23.502 --> 01:56:24.262]  Dark Seed.
[01:56:24.302 --> 01:56:25.883]  It's S-E-I-D.
[01:56:25.903 --> 01:56:33.324]  The Dark Seed comic character was created in 1971, who wants to end free will by connecting everyone's mind to a hive mind using technology.
[01:56:34.225 --> 01:56:44.947]  And did you know that Elon Musk's girlfriend, she released a song called Dark Seed, which she wrote and released, Alex, right before the pandemic started?
[01:56:44.967 --> 01:56:46.868]  So I'm gonna play a brief audio clip.
[01:56:46.888 --> 01:56:48.488]  This is Elon Musk's girlfriend.
[01:56:48.508 --> 01:56:54.969]   Now mind you folks, Elon Musk, the COVID-19, the Great Reset, for it to work, This is how it works, okay?
[01:56:55.230 --> 01:57:01.791]  We have to put RNA-modifying nanotechnology inside the human body that connects our minds via 5G technology.
[01:57:01.891 --> 01:57:10.332]  So you can't buy or sell without the technology in your body, and you can't actually buy or sell without... So this is the transhumanist takeover in their own words.
[01:57:10.372 --> 01:57:12.873]  Like you said, Harari, we're taking you over.
[01:57:12.893 --> 01:57:13.853]  I mean, this is it.
[01:57:14.093 --> 01:57:18.534]  It's like the Borg and Star Trek say, resistance is futile, but this is real.
[01:57:18.574 --> 01:57:19.154]  This is happening.
[01:57:20.197 --> 01:57:22.139]  It's real, and I want people to check this date, okay?
[01:57:22.159 --> 01:57:22.699]  The pandemic.
[01:57:22.759 --> 01:57:23.059]  Listen to this.
[01:57:23.099 --> 01:57:24.500]  I'm gonna play a brief audio clip.
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:26.362]  This is Elon Musk's girlfriend.
[01:57:26.402 --> 01:57:27.042]  She released a song.
[01:57:27.062 --> 01:57:28.163]  You can find it on YouTube right now.
[01:57:28.203 --> 01:57:29.244]  It's called Dark Seed.
[01:57:29.604 --> 01:57:36.429]  Now again, 1971, that's when the Dark Seed comic character came out that talked about ending free will by connecting your brain to the hive mind.
[01:57:36.469 --> 01:57:40.813]  So Elon Musk's girlfriend, Grimes, she puts out a song called Dark Seed.
[01:57:40.853 --> 01:57:42.554]  Everyone has to find it on YouTube, okay, folks?
[01:57:42.834 --> 01:57:46.157]  And it features an artist that no one's ever heard of by the name of Pan.
[01:57:46.914 --> 01:57:47.294]  Pan?
[01:57:47.675 --> 01:57:48.475]  Like pandemic?
[01:57:48.936 --> 01:57:52.979]  And the song is recorded entirely in Chinese, except for the first two lines.
[01:57:53.019 --> 01:57:55.000]  So listen to this, folks.
[01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:56.081]  This came out May of 2020.
[01:57:56.281 --> 01:57:57.322]  Listen to this.
[01:57:59.424 --> 01:58:00.124]  Listen to the lyrics.
[01:58:00.144 --> 01:58:00.765]  I'll read them to you.
[01:58:00.805 --> 01:58:01.445]  It's crazy.
[01:58:01.565 --> 01:58:02.266]  Listen to this, folks.
[01:58:05.068 --> 01:58:06.289]  Unrest is in the soul.
[01:58:08.350 --> 01:58:09.832]  We don't move our bodies anymore.
[01:58:09.852 --> 01:58:12.373]  This is Elon Musk's girlfriend, Grimes.
[01:58:12.514 --> 01:58:13.514]  What?
[01:58:13.514 --> 01:58:19.514]  [Music]
[01:58:19.514 --> 01:58:21.514]  And then the rest of the song is recorded in Chinese.
[01:58:21.514 --> 01:58:25.514]   And if you read the lyrics, it's all about implementing RNA-modifying nanotechnology inside your body.
[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:28.743]  And now she's left Elon Musk to marry a trainee.
[01:58:30.104 --> 01:58:35.969]  Yes, and she just did an interview, you can look it up right now, in Vanity Fair in April of 2020, where she does the Baphomet pose.
[01:58:36.349 --> 01:58:39.652]  And during that interview, she said they're planning on having more kids together.
[01:58:40.192 --> 01:58:44.956]  And recently, Elon Musk said that his new technology allows you to save state.
[01:58:45.737 --> 01:58:50.000]  Now I'm going to play this real quick for the listeners out there so you can hear this because most people haven't heard this before.
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:55.564]  This is Elon Musk explaining that his new Neuralink technology could allow you to have eternal life.
[01:58:55.604 --> 01:58:56.844]  Listen to Elon Musk explain this.
[01:58:57.125 --> 01:59:04.930]  Imagine that one day we would be able to download our human brain capacity into a Optimus.
[01:59:05.310 --> 01:59:05.570]  Yes.
[01:59:08.292 --> 01:59:12.775]  I think that is... I'm not saying this is... I think it is possible, I think, to do that.
[01:59:14.165 --> 01:59:18.768]  Which would be a different way of eternal life.
[01:59:19.549 --> 01:59:22.991]  Because we would also download our personalities into a bot.
[01:59:24.372 --> 01:59:28.335]  Yes, we could download... He just said you could have eternal life, listen!
[01:59:28.675 --> 01:59:30.597]  ...the things that we believe make ourselves unique.
[01:59:30.697 --> 01:59:35.641]  Now, of course, if you're not in a body anymore, there's definitely going to be some difference there, you know.
[01:59:38.011 --> 01:59:40.410]  But as far as preserving our memories.
[01:59:40.410 --> 01:59:45.211]   So Alex, during the same 30 day period of time, Grimes, who openly says she's still with Musk,
[01:59:45.211 --> 01:59:48.571]  she said they're in an open relationship that's complicated.
[01:59:48.571 --> 01:59:53.051]   She was asked during the interview, they said, well now that you can download people's minds and download
[01:59:53.051 --> 01:59:55.050]   their thoughts, whose mind would you like to download?
[01:59:55.050 --> 01:59:56.651]  And listen to what she says, this is crazy.
[01:59:56.651 --> 02:00:00.091]  This is Grimes, Elon Musk's girlfriend.
[02:00:00.091 --> 02:00:06.011]   If you could be someone else for a day, someone alive today, but somebody you haven't met yet, who
[02:00:06.011 --> 02:00:06.571]  would you be?
[02:00:06.571 --> 02:00:09.771]   Would I be modeling their brain state or would I just be in their body?
[02:00:09.771 --> 02:00:14.730]   You can choose the degree to which you're modeling their brain state.
[02:00:14.730 --> 02:00:16.730]  'cause she can still...
[02:00:16.371 --> 02:00:17.232]  Hold on, stay there.
[02:00:17.252 --> 02:00:19.293]  We've got to play this clip again when we come back with Clay Clark.
[02:00:19.313 --> 02:00:23.356]  Final segment ahead of the guest host in the fourth hour.
[02:00:23.396 --> 02:00:25.078]  I'm the Noah Troyer, 3 p.m.
[02:00:25.118 --> 02:00:25.898]  Central, The War Room.
[02:00:25.938 --> 02:00:27.920]  Wow, powerful information with Clay Clark.
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:30.602]  Clay Clark is on fire.
[02:00:33.124 --> 02:00:34.845]  God has given us free will.
[02:00:37.067 --> 02:00:39.369]  God has given us a vision of the future.
[02:00:40.376 --> 02:00:42.158]  We have been given the cheat sheet.
[02:00:42.198 --> 02:00:50.826]  Yes, we have free will, but God told us what was coming and that a fallen creature, not of this world, would try to enslave us and do this.
[02:00:50.926 --> 02:00:52.487]  And now we see it happening.
[02:00:52.788 --> 02:00:54.930]  And whether you believe in God or not, it's unfolding.
[02:00:56.636 --> 02:00:59.418]  And Clay Clark is here with us right now.
[02:00:59.438 --> 02:01:09.085]  He heads up one of the biggest, most important tours that just goes every week around the country and is reaching 5, 10, 20, 30,000 people in filled arenas.
[02:01:09.726 --> 02:01:10.927]  Rewaken America Tour.
[02:01:10.947 --> 02:01:14.009]  It was so great being with him in San Antonio six months ago.
[02:01:14.409 --> 02:01:16.071]  He's here with us now in the final segment.
[02:01:17.281 --> 02:01:28.366]  You know, to me, as negative as this is on the surface, it's very positive when you really pull back from it, because Revelation and Daniel and Ezekiel and all of it is being fulfilled.
[02:01:28.826 --> 02:01:29.847]  Old and New Testament.
[02:01:30.187 --> 02:01:33.729]  We're seeing everything that God told us would happen, happen right now.
[02:01:33.769 --> 02:01:38.511]  And thank God gave us Jesus Christ and the prophets before him to tell us what was coming.
[02:01:38.851 --> 02:01:40.952]  We've been given the blueprint of the enemy attack.
[02:01:42.313 --> 02:01:45.294]  You're 100% correct, and I want to make sure people understand this idea.
[02:01:45.314 --> 02:01:46.874]  You said God gave us free will.
[02:01:47.394 --> 02:01:53.655]  And what I found is that people don't understand that the enemy, they actually want to take away your free will.
[02:01:53.675 --> 02:01:55.235]  So I'm going to play this brief audio clip, Alex.
[02:01:55.255 --> 02:01:58.936]  This is the top advisor for Klaus Schwab, Yuval Noah Harari.
[02:01:59.216 --> 02:02:00.556]  And listen to what he says.
[02:02:00.636 --> 02:02:01.857]  This is Yuval Noah Harari.
[02:02:02.137 --> 02:02:05.817]  Listen to how he, this is a man praised by Obama, Zuckerberg, Gates.
[02:02:06.098 --> 02:02:07.938]  Listen to what he, how he describes humanity.
[02:02:08.918 --> 02:02:17.660]  Humans are now hackable animals.
[02:02:19.200 --> 02:02:35.263]  You know, the whole idea that humans have, you know, they have this soul or spirit and they have free will and nobody knows what's happening inside me, so whatever I choose, whether in the election or whether in the supermarket, this is my free will, that's over.
[02:02:35.823 --> 02:02:36.224]  We will.
[02:02:36.384 --> 02:02:37.045]  That's over.
[02:02:37.205 --> 02:02:42.110]  So Alex, what I want to do on this final segment, if I can, I'm going to pull up a little diagram on the screen here for listeners.
[02:02:42.430 --> 02:02:45.794]  And Alex, I spent about $3 because of inflation.
[02:02:45.814 --> 02:02:47.455]  This could be $6 by the end of the month here.
[02:02:47.796 --> 02:02:49.097]  But this is how it works here, OK?
[02:02:49.417 --> 02:02:50.338]  We have Team God.
[02:02:50.859 --> 02:02:51.840]  They have Team Satan.
[02:02:52.412 --> 02:02:53.734]  We have what's called the Bible.
[02:02:54.254 --> 02:02:57.078]  Their Bible is literally COVID-19, the Great Reset.
[02:02:57.399 --> 02:02:59.201]  Their plan is to end free will.
[02:02:59.501 --> 02:03:00.202]  We have a Bible.
[02:03:00.462 --> 02:03:02.705]  They have COVID-19, the Great Reset.
[02:03:03.006 --> 02:03:05.970]  They have a leader who has a lot of traction and a lot of influence.
[02:03:06.010 --> 02:03:07.772]  His name is Klaus Schwab.
[02:03:08.416 --> 02:03:09.077]  We have a leader.
[02:03:09.237 --> 02:03:12.320]  I'm not saying that President Donald J. Trump is my religious leader.
[02:03:12.340 --> 02:03:18.406]  In my org chart, Jesus is king, Trump is the president, General Flynn is America's general, and my wife is the boss.
[02:03:18.426 --> 02:03:19.527]  That's how it works at the Clark House.
[02:03:19.767 --> 02:03:21.789]  But Klaus Schwab is their leader.
[02:03:21.849 --> 02:03:23.150]  Trump is the leader of the free world.
[02:03:23.591 --> 02:03:28.636]  Their top advisor, their perverse prophet, is Yuval Noah Harari.
[02:03:28.996 --> 02:03:32.760]  And President Trump has seven people, eight people close to him.
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:34.762]  And five of them are on the tour!
[02:03:35.122 --> 02:03:42.010]  I mean, we've had Peter Navarro, Kash Patel, General Flynn, Eric Trump, Don Trump Jr.
[02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:51.680]  These are all the people that are on the tour, so if you actually want to know what's going on, and not speculate what's going on, for people that are actually in the know, that are at the tip of the spear... No, that's right.
[02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:55.084]  If you look at who's around Trump, it's very exciting.
[02:03:56.204 --> 02:03:56.564]  It is!
[02:03:56.604 --> 02:04:02.908]  I mean, we have got the people close to Trump that are in those secret meetings coming to share about the Durham report, what's going on.
[02:04:02.948 --> 02:04:05.509]  Now their goal, Team Satan, is total control, okay?
[02:04:05.729 --> 02:04:11.753]  They want you to wear a mask, they want quarantines, curfews, forced RNA-modifying nanotechnology inside your body that controls your thoughts.
[02:04:12.153 --> 02:04:13.914]  God wants for you to have free will.
[02:04:14.374 --> 02:04:18.036]  Satan wants for you to live in hell, and God wants for you to have salvation.
[02:04:18.296 --> 02:04:22.879]  So I encourage everybody right now, if you're watching right now, I have three calls to action for you.
[02:04:23.579 --> 02:04:32.654]   One, it might sound kind of crazy, If you're not right with God right now, I want you to invite Jesus Christ into your heart to be your Lord and Savior.
[02:04:32.974 --> 02:04:33.535]  I mean that.
[02:04:34.475 --> 02:04:37.596]  I just got baptized, Alex, this weekend for the first time in my life.
[02:04:37.636 --> 02:04:43.899]  I've never been baptized, and I know that God has arrested my attention, and God is arresting the attention of your listeners right now.
[02:04:43.939 --> 02:04:48.782]  There's somebody watching right now, and you feel like, man, I have really made some poor choices in my life.
[02:04:48.802 --> 02:04:49.322]  Well, check it out.
[02:04:49.890 --> 02:04:54.619]  Paul, his name was once Saul, he wrote 13 books of the Bible, okay?
[02:04:54.639 --> 02:04:57.344]  He went around murdering Christians, but he was saved.
[02:04:59.056 --> 02:05:04.838]  Exactly, and God arrested his attention, filled him with conviction to fulfill the Great Commission.
[02:05:04.858 --> 02:05:14.382]  So I encourage you, all you have to do is say, Dear Jesus, please forgive me for my sins, and you want to repent, which means you want to go the opposite way moving forward, and you have a new mission, and you have a new hope.
[02:05:14.402 --> 02:05:15.363]  And that's what God's looking for.
[02:05:15.443 --> 02:05:17.364]  God is ready for you to make that choice.
[02:05:18.344 --> 02:05:20.405]  God only judges the heart, as King David said.
[02:05:21.678 --> 02:05:24.180]  And so, call to action number one is get right with God.
[02:05:24.660 --> 02:05:27.403]  Call to action number two is you say, well, what can I do?
[02:05:27.863 --> 02:05:32.607]  I encourage you, go to timetofreeamerica.com and get your tickets to come join us in Virginia Beach.
[02:05:32.647 --> 02:05:33.627]  That's going to be in July.
[02:05:33.687 --> 02:05:34.688]  Be with the brethren.
[02:05:34.728 --> 02:05:36.930]  Be with all these amazing people and bring family.
[02:05:38.241 --> 02:05:48.865]  And Alex, what's so neat is we've had business owners in the manufacturing space, in the medical space, that are hiring employees on the spot that don't wish to take the RNA-modifying nanotechnology shots.
[02:05:49.445 --> 02:05:51.085]  I mean, it's like a job fair.
[02:05:51.145 --> 02:05:54.847]  We have doctors willing to treat you if you don't want to take the RNA-modifying nanotechnology.
[02:05:55.147 --> 02:05:56.867]  Attorneys willing to help you fight back.
[02:05:57.087 --> 02:06:02.549]  You know, a lot of the school board victories that have occurred have started at the Reawaken America tours.
[02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:05.130]  Oh, it totally scares the system that we're coming together.
[02:06:06.255 --> 02:06:07.335]  It's powerful.
[02:06:07.375 --> 02:06:08.816]  So go to time2freeamerica.com.
[02:06:08.836 --> 02:06:09.716]  You can name your price.
[02:06:10.116 --> 02:06:13.397]  I know the mainstream media would like you to think that Clay Clark is getting rich at these events.
[02:06:13.597 --> 02:06:14.517]  You can name your price.
[02:06:14.557 --> 02:06:16.158]  I don't take a dime of income or salary.
[02:06:16.198 --> 02:06:19.519]  Hey, I hope you make $50 million to beat them, but you're not.
[02:06:19.859 --> 02:06:25.401]  We need to support independent brethren of all races, colors, and creeds coming together under Jesus.
[02:06:26.801 --> 02:06:31.042]  Well, Alex, you know, the thing is, when you come to these events, it costs about a half a million dollars to put on a really well-run event.
[02:06:31.062 --> 02:06:31.262]  I know.
[02:06:31.302 --> 02:06:32.243]  That's why I can't even do them.
[02:06:32.283 --> 02:06:32.983]  Yeah, I hear you.
[02:06:34.045 --> 02:06:37.748]  Well, name their price, and the average person, Alex, is, you know, is paying what they can pay.
[02:06:37.768 --> 02:06:38.509]  I mean, that's the deal.
[02:06:38.529 --> 02:06:38.969]  We have some VIPs.
[02:06:38.989 --> 02:06:41.451]  For those who don't know, it's so hard to organize events.
[02:06:41.471 --> 02:06:42.632]  I don't know how you guys have done it.
[02:06:43.653 --> 02:06:44.394]  Well, let me just tell you.
[02:06:44.414 --> 02:06:45.055]  This just in, Alex.
[02:06:45.115 --> 02:06:46.256]  I've not announced this on any show.
[02:06:46.276 --> 02:06:49.859]  I've got the final lineup here for the Reawaken America Tour in Virginia Beach.
[02:06:49.879 --> 02:06:51.200]  Let me just read this to the folks out there.
[02:06:52.041 --> 02:06:55.303]  We start at 10 a.m., and there's a speaker every 15 minutes.
[02:06:55.323 --> 02:06:55.964]  But check this out.
[02:06:56.004 --> 02:06:57.225]  Listen to how hot this lineup is.
[02:06:57.745 --> 02:07:02.849]   At 3.20, we have Jimmy Levy and Hi-Rez, the hip-hop duo that shares ...of America.
[02:07:03.129 --> 02:07:10.292]  At 3.40, Jim Brewer, the comedian, gets out there and he just absolutely exposes the deep state while making you laugh, the corruption of Hollywood.
[02:07:10.632 --> 02:07:13.853]  Then we have Donald J. Trump Jr., he gets on the stage at 4.30.
[02:07:14.174 --> 02:07:16.274]  Dr. Dave Martin's on at 5 o'clock.
[02:07:16.635 --> 02:07:18.055]  Kash Patel, are you kidding me?
[02:07:18.375 --> 02:07:18.975]  He gets on at 5.30.
[02:07:20.036 --> 02:07:26.158]  Sean Stone, who you just had on your show, Sean Stone, Oliver Stone's son, the great producer-director Sean Stone, he'll be joining the tour.
[02:07:26.378 --> 02:07:28.959]  And then at 5.45, America's General, General Michael Flynn.
[02:07:29.159 --> 02:07:30.960]  And that's how we end day one, Alex!
[02:07:32.040 --> 02:07:32.781]  I mean, that's how we end.
[02:07:33.361 --> 02:07:39.067]  I didn't even mention that Eric Trump, Amanda Grace, the prophet, Kim Clement, the late great prophet, his daughter's on the lineup.
[02:07:39.707 --> 02:07:42.170]  I just found out that Peter McCullough will be rejoining us.
[02:07:42.690 --> 02:07:46.153]  Mickey Willis will be debuting Plandemic Part 3.
[02:07:46.273 --> 02:07:49.376]  My good friend Mickey Willis is debuting Plandemic Part 3.
[02:07:49.456 --> 02:07:51.138]  This scares them.
[02:07:51.218 --> 02:07:52.379]  This scares them so.
[02:07:53.440 --> 02:07:54.301]  So much.
[02:07:54.421 --> 02:07:54.681]  Wow.
[02:07:55.081 --> 02:07:56.261]  Well, I love your work.
[02:07:56.742 --> 02:07:58.803]  Clay Clark, we appreciate everything you're doing.
[02:07:58.823 --> 02:08:00.743]  And I want to invite you back on a routine basis.
[02:08:01.284 --> 02:08:02.544]  Love meeting you in person.
[02:08:02.624 --> 02:08:03.465]  Love what you're doing.
[02:08:03.485 --> 02:08:04.945]  It's so incredible.
[02:08:04.965 --> 02:08:06.186]  And they hate us getting together.
[02:08:06.546 --> 02:08:07.727]  They hate this truth getting out.
[02:08:07.747 --> 02:08:14.310]  And then all the hundreds of media that are there, if not thousands, and all the interviews I did when I was there, that all goes viral.
[02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:18.432]  It's just a major operation to expose the globalist takeover.
[02:08:18.472 --> 02:08:19.132]  It is so beautiful.
[02:08:20.333 --> 02:08:50.072]   And Alex, if I get abducted by an alien, or I just want to tell you this, I mean this, I pray for you, and it's an honor to be on your program because you have been a man in the wilderness that's been attacked for a long, long time, and I sincerely have prayed for you, I've prayed for General Flynn, I've prayed for Eric Trump, I've prayed for Seth Kessel, I've prayed for so many people that are on the tour, Mike Lindell, and it's an honor to meet you in person, and it's an honor to see your heart, And you were super humble at the San Antonio event.
[02:08:50.092 --> 02:08:53.754]  You stopped by and you said, hey, if you would like me on the stage, I'd love to be there.
[02:08:53.795 --> 02:08:54.675]  If not, no worries.
[02:08:55.015 --> 02:09:02.661]  And you came up and I feel like you delivered a message, a gospel message that many pastors today need to deliver.
[02:09:02.701 --> 02:09:06.344]  I mean, you clearly pointed out it's the great reawakening versus the great reset.
[02:09:06.644 --> 02:09:07.505]  There's heaven and hell.
[02:09:07.525 --> 02:09:08.946]  There's free will versus control.
[02:09:08.966 --> 02:09:10.127]  There's Satan versus Jesus.
[02:09:10.928 --> 02:09:14.934]  Alex, you did not leave anything left to be said there, my friend.
[02:09:14.974 --> 02:09:18.640]  You absolutely did a powerful salvation message in San Antonio.
[02:09:19.021 --> 02:09:20.723]  The most important part was, God wins.
[02:09:22.094 --> 02:09:22.875]  God does win.
[02:09:23.075 --> 02:09:23.575]  God does win.
[02:09:23.595 --> 02:09:24.776]  I'll tell people this, a little fun stat.
[02:09:24.816 --> 02:09:27.278]  People say, how do you know these events were a success?
[02:09:27.498 --> 02:09:33.002]  The Myrtle Beach event we just did, we had over 500 baptisms that happened at that event.
[02:09:33.462 --> 02:09:36.545]  Alex, it's just an unbelievable thing to see people getting back to God.
[02:09:36.565 --> 02:09:38.586]  We have election fraud, medical fraud, religious fraud.
[02:09:38.666 --> 02:09:40.247]  I've got to get back on the tour with you, brother.
[02:09:40.287 --> 02:09:42.909]  I'm just tied down here in the fight, but thank you so much.
[02:09:42.929 --> 02:09:44.030]  Clay Clark, we salute you.
[02:09:44.050 --> 02:09:45.711]  Everybody should go to all your events.
[02:09:45.771 --> 02:09:46.892]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:09:46.932 --> 02:09:47.432]  God bless you.
[02:09:48.613 --> 02:09:49.094]  Thank you, brother.
[02:09:49.134 --> 02:09:49.434]  Take care.
[02:09:51.673 --> 02:09:52.475]  Clay Clark Show.

[02:10:05.891 --> 02:10:06.871]  Freedom is on fire.
[02:10:07.192 --> 02:10:10.454]  Look at the energy and the intelligence of that guy versus the Satanists.
[02:10:11.034 --> 02:10:13.316]  And it lets you know what side you want to be on.
[02:10:13.336 --> 02:10:16.939]  So whether you're old, young, black, white, Hispanic, I love you.
[02:10:16.959 --> 02:10:18.580]  And this is an incredible time.

[02:12:18.937 --> 02:12:20.479]  Root4America.com.
[02:12:20.939 --> 02:12:21.740]  I am Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:12:21.780 --> 02:12:22.661]  What do I do all day?
[02:12:22.781 --> 02:12:24.122]  I root for America.
[02:12:24.142 --> 02:12:26.704]  From the day I was born, I've been rooting for this great country.
[02:12:26.744 --> 02:12:27.525]  God bless America.
[02:12:28.431 --> 02:12:29.673]  And number two, how do you reach me?
[02:12:29.713 --> 02:12:31.095]  Wayne Root at gmail dot com.
[02:12:31.536 --> 02:12:32.897]  Wayne Root at gmail dot com.
[02:12:32.957 --> 02:12:33.879]  I love to hear from all of you.
[02:12:34.239 --> 02:12:36.362]  During the show, I get so many emails from all of you.
[02:12:37.043 --> 02:12:39.386]  And then after the show, I get hundreds of emails from all of you.
[02:12:39.446 --> 02:12:41.830]  It's it's wonderful because it gives me ideas.
[02:12:42.529 --> 02:12:44.791]  For how to conduct my radio show later today.
[02:12:44.811 --> 02:12:45.952]  I've got a national radio show.
[02:12:46.393 --> 02:12:48.895]  We now root on unfiltered on USA Radio Network.
[02:12:49.315 --> 02:12:53.199]  And if you don't get it wherever you are on your radio stations, ask them to get it.
[02:12:53.279 --> 02:12:59.805]  And if you can't get it there, then just tune in at usaradio.com, live every day, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:13:00.525 --> 02:13:01.947]  West Coast time, 6 to 9 p.m.
[02:13:02.007 --> 02:13:03.008]  East, 5 to 8 p.m.
[02:13:03.408 --> 02:13:03.988]  Central time.
[02:13:04.089 --> 02:13:08.873]  Or go to rootforamerica.com, my website, and you can find it right there.
[02:13:10.143 --> 02:13:17.331]  I also want to mention when I talk about how great America is, love this country, I'm always rooting for America, rootforamerica.com, get it?
[02:13:17.932 --> 02:13:18.953]  Only in America, right?
[02:13:19.414 --> 02:13:23.418]  I just found out, literally, I have my own star on the Vegas Walk of Stars.
[02:13:23.438 --> 02:13:23.899]  I got that in 2006.
[02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:42.515]  Before I ever got into politics for being the king of Vegas sports gambling, being the number one odds maker and sports prognosticator in the world, and they lowered a 180-pound granite star into the sidewalk in front of Paris Hotel on the Vegas Strip on Las Vegas Boulevard in Las Vegas.
[02:13:42.535 --> 02:13:49.261]  The Las Vegas Walk of Stars, Wayne Root with Frank Sinatra, Elvis, Wayne Newton, Liberace, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr., and Bobby Darin.
[02:13:49.581 --> 02:13:50.002]  Not bad.
[02:13:50.502 --> 02:13:50.962]  Not bad.
[02:13:51.362 --> 02:13:52.923]  So that's where I got my first star.
[02:13:53.063 --> 02:14:01.127]  Now, I just found out yesterday, I am being inducted into the Nevada Broadcasting Hall of Fame for my political talk show.
[02:14:01.547 --> 02:14:02.588]  I guarantee you this much.
[02:14:03.088 --> 02:14:10.371]  In all of the United States of America, 330 million people for the last 270 years, whatever the number is, we've been in existence.
[02:14:10.811 --> 02:14:15.674]  No one's ever been in the Hall of Fame for both sports and a political talk show.
[02:14:15.754 --> 02:14:16.094]  I'm it.
[02:14:16.214 --> 02:14:16.834]  I'm number one.
[02:14:17.194 --> 02:14:17.715]  The only one.
[02:14:17.775 --> 02:14:18.275]  Numero uno.
[02:14:18.795 --> 02:14:19.175]  The GOAT.
[02:14:19.355 --> 02:14:22.356]  So, uh, thank you everybody, all of you made it possible.
[02:14:22.396 --> 02:14:23.776]  All my listeners and all my fans.
[02:14:24.176 --> 02:14:25.316]  Without you, I have no show.
[02:14:25.356 --> 02:14:26.597]  Without you, I have no success.
[02:14:27.137 --> 02:14:29.277]  And so, uh, thanks for all that you do.
[02:14:29.337 --> 02:14:32.078]  And I'll be inducted, I think it's October 16th.
[02:14:32.098 --> 02:14:33.318]  I don't have it in front of me.
[02:14:33.338 --> 02:14:39.539]  It's either the 15th or the 16th is a big gala dinner dance in Las Vegas for the Nevada Broadcasters Hall of Fame.
[02:14:39.879 --> 02:14:40.939]  And I'll be entering that.
[02:14:40.999 --> 02:14:44.240]  So, lots of great things happening in my life, only in America.
[02:14:44.640 --> 02:14:56.063]  Could a son of a butcher, an SOB, from the mean streets of New York, from a... literally, I'm not only a dead-end kid as an expression, but I literally was born and raised on a street that was a dead-end street.
[02:14:56.744 --> 02:15:09.868]  And only could a kid like that go to an all-black middle school, all-black high school, and wind up one day with a star in the Vegas sidewalk, next to Frank Sinatra and Elvis, and then inducted into the Nevada Broadcaster's Hall of Fame.
[02:15:09.968 --> 02:15:10.548]  Only in America.
[02:15:10.608 --> 02:15:11.128]  Great country.
[02:15:11.668 --> 02:15:19.838]  Doesn't that tell you why it's so obscene and absurd and pathetic and wrong that liberals want to destroy things as they are now?
[02:15:20.518 --> 02:15:21.960]  It doesn't get any better in this country.
[02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:22.981]  Do you have any idea?
[02:15:23.121 --> 02:15:23.862]  Turn on the TV.
[02:15:23.882 --> 02:15:24.783]  Turn on TMZ.
[02:15:25.464 --> 02:15:26.866]  Tune into the National Enquirer.
[02:15:27.767 --> 02:15:28.568]  Turn on MTV.
[02:15:29.403 --> 02:15:30.384]  Turn on VH1.
[02:15:30.764 --> 02:15:32.725]  All you see is black superstars.
[02:15:33.146 --> 02:15:37.528]  All you see is black people who make a hundred million a year and are worth a billion dollars.
[02:15:38.049 --> 02:15:47.795]  This is the greatest country in the world with the most opportunity in the world for black and brown skinned people as well as white people as well as everybody else.
[02:15:48.336 --> 02:15:50.617]  Gay and straight and Christian and Jewish.
[02:15:50.957 --> 02:15:52.158]  I don't care what you are.
[02:15:52.178 --> 02:15:54.960]  This is the greatest country in world's history.
[02:15:55.620 --> 02:15:56.921]  And that's why it's all so crazy.
[02:15:56.941 --> 02:15:58.642]  I have so much to tell you about on this show.
[02:15:59.222 --> 02:16:00.323]  About the new polling.
[02:16:00.343 --> 02:16:02.544]  About transgender issues.
[02:16:02.684 --> 02:16:05.706]  I was right on the money with everything I've been saying.
[02:16:06.306 --> 02:16:07.227]  And about Twitter.
[02:16:07.667 --> 02:16:09.848]  Undercover video from Project Veritas.
[02:16:10.209 --> 02:16:14.111]  And they got a Twitter big shot saying things that will shock you.
[02:16:14.850 --> 02:16:21.912]  But it really won't shock you because it's so clear that the entire Democrat Party is a party of communists who are out to destroy the United States.
[02:16:21.972 --> 02:16:24.973]  It's a communist attack and a communist takeover of the United States.
[02:16:25.353 --> 02:16:26.213]  And now we have proof.
[02:16:26.593 --> 02:16:31.554]  And boy, do I have news to tell you about COVID coming up in the next segment, the COVID vaccine.
[02:16:32.095 --> 02:16:33.615]  Once again, I'm on the money.
[02:16:33.975 --> 02:16:36.476]  I've been saying for a year and a half, don't go near this vaccine.
[02:16:36.936 --> 02:16:37.636]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:16:38.263 --> 02:16:40.825]  Rootforamerica.com, wayroot at gmail.com.
[02:16:41.146 --> 02:16:46.831]  Thank you, Alex Jones, for guest hosting every Tuesday, right here on InfoWars and the Alex Jones Network.
[02:16:48.456 --> 02:16:51.157]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root, live on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:51.197 --> 02:16:54.699]  Guest hosting, as always, on Tuesdays from 3 to 4 p.m.
[02:16:54.739 --> 02:16:57.200]  East Coast, 12 noon to 1 p.m.
[02:16:57.420 --> 02:16:58.320]  on the West Coast.
[02:16:58.740 --> 02:17:00.941]  Honored and privileged to be able to do it.
[02:17:00.961 --> 02:17:01.641]  What a great country.
[02:17:01.681 --> 02:17:15.567]  I repeat again, I'm an SOB, a son of a butcher, from the wrong side of the tracks at a dead-end street in Malvern, New York, from a majority-minority town, a mostly black town, went to an all-black high school, all-black middle school, and what a great country.
[02:17:15.647 --> 02:17:16.688]  God bless America.
[02:17:16.748 --> 02:17:17.368]  Only in America.
[02:17:17.748 --> 02:17:18.628]  Capitalism works.
[02:17:19.689 --> 02:17:23.271]  Let me tell you about some things that are in the news that I think are so important for you.
[02:17:24.051 --> 02:17:30.334]  Number one, Project Veritas with their undercover videos has nailed Twitter to the cross again.
[02:17:30.834 --> 02:17:36.837]  And while it's shocking what you're going to hear at the same time, it's just not shocking because everybody knows it.
[02:17:37.277 --> 02:17:38.498]  We know they're out to get us.
[02:17:38.558 --> 02:17:39.358]  We know they hate us.
[02:17:39.398 --> 02:17:40.259]  We know they ban us.
[02:17:40.639 --> 02:17:41.659]  We know they censor us.
[02:17:41.719 --> 02:17:42.820]  We know they don't want us to speak.
[02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:56.010]  But senior Twitter engineer caught on hidden camera in another Project Veritas undercover video confirming the whole company is commie as F. You know the F word I'm talking about.
[02:17:56.451 --> 02:17:59.973]  Commie as F and does not believe in free speech.
[02:18:00.013 --> 02:18:06.599]  He says the reason we all hate Elon Musk and want to get out of here if Musk takes over is we don't believe in free speech.
[02:18:06.659 --> 02:18:08.260]  Conservatives believe in free speech.
[02:18:08.660 --> 02:18:10.742]  We don't believe the other side has a right to talk.
[02:18:11.351 --> 02:18:12.412]  Does that shock anybody?
[02:18:12.432 --> 02:18:14.392]  I mean, it's shocking, but it doesn't shock anyone.
[02:18:14.773 --> 02:18:15.413]  We all know it.
[02:18:15.773 --> 02:18:22.476]  We know Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and YouTube and all the Silicon Valley high-tech companies think that way.
[02:18:22.536 --> 02:18:25.178]  All the social media executives think that way.
[02:18:25.558 --> 02:18:27.919]  We know the entire American media thinks that way.
[02:18:28.279 --> 02:18:29.620]  We know Hollywood thinks that way.
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:38.204]  We know every teacher for the Teachers Union thinks that way at public schools, and we know that every professor and dean at every college thinks that way.
[02:18:39.744 --> 02:18:41.465]  Well, most of them do anyway.
[02:18:41.525 --> 02:18:49.971]  My wonderful son, Hudson Root, by the way, I got to give him kudos, just graduated on Saturday from SMU, Southern Methodist University.
[02:18:50.370 --> 02:18:55.930]   Congratulations Hudson, 22 years old, chip off the old block, studied business and finance,
[02:18:55.930 --> 02:19:01.610]   graduated from the Cox School of Business at SMU, and for four years, you know, again,
[02:19:01.610 --> 02:19:05.709]   we're in a country where if you do go to college, which a lot of kids never do,
[02:19:05.709 --> 02:19:09.010]   but this kid got the best scores in the country and the best grades in the country
[02:19:09.010 --> 02:19:12.670]   and the best SAT scores in the country, and instead of going to Harvard,
[02:19:12.670 --> 02:19:15.549]  chose SMU, and what a brilliant choice.
[02:19:15.549 --> 02:19:19.950]   For four years I haven't mentioned it to anyone ever, 'cause I thought who knows what kid
[02:19:19.950 --> 02:19:26.229]   on a college campus might try to hurt my son, whether physically hurt him or literally hurt him
[02:19:26.229 --> 02:19:28.190]  with his grades, a professor.
[02:19:28.403 --> 02:19:31.364]  So I never mentioned his college till the day he graduated.
[02:19:31.784 --> 02:19:32.384]  He's out!
[02:19:32.904 --> 02:19:33.704]  Victory!
[02:19:34.125 --> 02:19:35.045]  I can say it now.
[02:19:35.425 --> 02:19:42.147]  Graduated SMU, one of the only colleges in America, and certainly the only great college in America, and it's a great college.
[02:19:42.507 --> 02:19:46.209]  It's the Harvard of Texas and the whole west of the Mississippi.
[02:19:48.343 --> 02:19:53.044]  What makes it great besides great academics and great professors and great learning, okay?
[02:19:53.064 --> 02:19:54.865]  They're not teaching you how to be an artist.
[02:19:54.905 --> 02:19:57.545]  They're teaching you how to score in business and finance.
[02:19:57.885 --> 02:20:00.266]  But what makes it great is no lockdowns.
[02:20:00.506 --> 02:20:01.546]  Everyone went to class.
[02:20:01.886 --> 02:20:02.646]  There's SMU.
[02:20:03.046 --> 02:20:08.648]  No masks, and most importantly, no vaccine requirement ever in his four years in college.
[02:20:09.128 --> 02:20:10.568]  And here's the deal, folks.
[02:20:10.848 --> 02:20:12.689]  This is, again, what makes Conservative so great.
[02:20:13.029 --> 02:20:14.709]  It ties in with the Twitter story, right?
[02:20:15.296 --> 02:20:21.103]  Twitter's exec senior engineer admits that they are commie as F. F-U.
[02:20:21.223 --> 02:20:23.626]  Commie as F-U, that famous curse word.
[02:20:23.666 --> 02:20:27.531]  I won't say on this air and give them the dignity of me saying something like that.
[02:20:27.912 --> 02:20:28.833]  But here's the deal.
[02:20:30.262 --> 02:20:32.463]  Terrible people and they admit they're against free speech.
[02:20:32.803 --> 02:20:38.406]  They admit we agree with free speech and want free speech and we'll give them free speech, but they won't give it to us.
[02:20:38.966 --> 02:20:40.987]  And that's a great example of SMU.
[02:20:41.607 --> 02:20:42.908]  I don't believe in the vaccine.
[02:20:42.928 --> 02:20:44.089]  I think the vaccine is poison.
[02:20:44.109 --> 02:20:45.109]  I'm going to tell you about it in a minute.
[02:20:45.409 --> 02:20:51.532]  The vaccine is a death jab that's killing literally thousands of people a day all over the world and here in America.
[02:20:51.872 --> 02:20:54.693]  And we have all kinds of proofs stocking up showing that.
[02:20:55.174 --> 02:21:19.396]   But I would never stop you from getting it and I don't believe in masks and I've got a new study that proves masks don't work of over 625,000 Europeans in 35 countries that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt masks are a total failure they don't work but I wouldn't stop you from wearing a mask and I know lockdowns don't work they haven't locked they haven't worked anywhere in the world ever in the history of mankind all they do is destroy every business and kill capitalism
[02:21:19.796 --> 02:21:31.740]  And kill all the small businessmen and women and give the advantage to Costco and Walmart and the big box retailers Lowe's and Home Depot and every big store is open while the little stores are called non-essential and closed.
[02:21:32.080 --> 02:21:35.381]  So we know lockdowns don't work, but I wouldn't stop you from locking down.
[02:21:35.741 --> 02:21:40.502]  If you want to lock down your house, if you don't want your kid going to school and you want them to learn online, good luck.
[02:21:40.542 --> 02:21:41.122]  God bless you.
[02:21:41.483 --> 02:21:43.523]  That means my kid will score way past your kid.
[02:21:43.843 --> 02:21:49.245]  Your kid should be locked down, learned at home, vaccinated 12 times and masked.
[02:21:49.625 --> 02:21:50.466]  And you know what that means?
[02:21:51.006 --> 02:21:54.368]  More money and success for my kids and your kids will be losers.
[02:21:54.728 --> 02:21:55.569]  So good luck to you.
[02:21:55.609 --> 02:21:56.189]  God bless you.
[02:21:56.490 --> 02:22:00.532]  But we believe in freedom, personal freedom and economic freedom as conservatives.
[02:22:00.853 --> 02:22:05.636]  And you can be as stupid and as ignorant as you want to be and we'll allow you to be it.
[02:22:05.976 --> 02:22:11.576]   But my son just graduated SMU with honors, graduated with just under a 4.0 average,
[02:22:11.576 --> 02:22:15.335]   and is moving into a finance career, already hired at a top job,
[02:22:15.335 --> 02:22:19.815]   and will spend the rest of his life, at this point, he believes, in beautiful Texas.
[02:22:19.815 --> 02:22:26.015]   If we ever secede or divorce as a nation, separate as a nation, Texas is where we're all gonna go.
[02:22:26.015 --> 02:22:30.456]   It'll be the People's Republic of Texas, up against all the blue communist states.
[02:22:30.456 --> 02:22:31.976]  So, great job, Hudson.
[02:22:32.140 --> 02:22:32.500]  Love ya.
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:40.242]  My daughter, Dakota Root, about to be Dr. Dakota Root, 29 years old, and about to become a doctor.
[02:22:40.782 --> 02:22:43.203]  And that will happen next month in June.
[02:22:43.543 --> 02:22:47.064]  So two of my four kids out of the house, and they've achieved their objectives.
[02:22:47.405 --> 02:22:53.467]   And in a nation where not everyone goes to college, and only the best go to the best schools, Both of them graduated college.
[02:22:53.527 --> 02:23:00.749]  My daughter graduated Harvard Phi Beta Kappa in four years and Hudson graduated with honors at SMU in four years.
[02:23:01.129 --> 02:23:10.852]  You know, most kids now go to college for six years and eight years because daddy teaches you what to do and how to be successful, how to be disciplined and how to be successful.
[02:23:10.912 --> 02:23:13.433]  Proud Daddy Root for Dakota Root and Hudson Root.
[02:23:13.453 --> 02:23:14.513]  Good job, kiddies.
[02:23:15.484 --> 02:23:21.431]  Okay, so on this show, I've told all of you, you know, I've got the book, The Great Patriot Protest, a boycott book.
[02:23:23.693 --> 02:23:32.763]  It is a book that teaches you how to boycott and fight the woke corporations like Disney and Netflix and all kinds of Delta Airlines and Ben and Jerry's.
[02:23:32.823 --> 02:23:35.206]  And God, there's so many companies that are woke and horrible.
[02:23:35.506 --> 02:23:36.888]  It's hard to list them all, but I did.
[02:23:37.268 --> 02:23:45.315]  I went out and compiled 116 companies that are treat patriots and conservatives and Christians like garbage, but we make them rich by buying their products.
[02:23:45.676 --> 02:23:46.736]  I show you how to boycott them.
[02:23:46.756 --> 02:23:51.741]  Go to Amazon or Barnes and Noble and get the book or go to my website, Root for America to find out more.
[02:23:52.181 --> 02:23:55.124]  But I've told you on this show how many guest hosts.
[02:23:56.169 --> 02:23:57.109]  Weeks have I done this?
[02:23:57.169 --> 02:23:58.710]  I don't know, probably for the last four months.
[02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:02.250]  So four times four, about 16 weeks I've done this now.
[02:24:02.691 --> 02:24:06.031]  And each of those 16 weeks, I've told you, go after Disney, go after Disney.
[02:24:06.391 --> 02:24:12.893]  The transgender issue is the best issue in the history of conservative movement and the Republican Party and the patriot movement.
[02:24:13.333 --> 02:24:14.913]  It is a great issue.
[02:24:15.293 --> 02:24:16.714]  Open borders is a great issue.
[02:24:17.034 --> 02:24:18.654]  Vaccine mandates a great issue.
[02:24:19.034 --> 02:24:20.795]  Inflation is killing the middle class.
[02:24:20.835 --> 02:24:22.015]  Great issue for Republicans.
[02:24:22.475 --> 02:24:53.070]   But this transgender combined with critical race theory, combined with sexual identity changing of kids, brainwashing, allowing them to get sex change operations without their parents' permission, allowing them to get shots of stimulants and hormones without their parents' permission, allowing them to go into secret closets at school where boys dress like girls and girls dress like boys during the school hours and then get back in their regular clothes so mom and dad don't know they're transitioning to become The other sex.
[02:24:53.130 --> 02:24:57.573]  It's all disgusting and everyone agrees with me and you about it.
[02:24:57.893 --> 02:25:04.656]  And the Democrats are so dumb, we're going to take down their whole party and that's going to be the end of them starting this November over this issue.
[02:25:04.996 --> 02:25:06.297]  And that's what I've said from day one.
[02:25:06.337 --> 02:25:13.340]  But there's a few dumb rhino Republicans like Mitt Romney, I'm sure, and Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, who's a Republican.
[02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:17.362]  He was at some event like two months ago and this whole Disney thing came down.
[02:25:17.802 --> 02:25:25.290]  With Governor DeSantis attacking Disney because they attacked him over the transgender school issue for kindergartners.
[02:25:25.770 --> 02:25:34.279]  And Governor Hogan, a Republican, but a very liberal Mitt Romney Republican who I hate and despise, he said, what a stupid issue, what a horrible issue.
[02:25:34.599 --> 02:25:36.041]  Republicans need to run away from it.
[02:25:36.301 --> 02:25:37.382]  DeSantis is crazy.
[02:25:37.783 --> 02:25:38.784]  Well, the polls are out.
[02:25:39.324 --> 02:25:54.726]  And the latest polls show Americans overwhelmingly agree with me and DeSantis and Trump and the real Republican conservatives of this world that we don't want transgenderism taught in school at all, but certainly not to kindergartners.
[02:25:55.046 --> 02:26:09.675]  The third graders and we don't want you telling our children to change sexes or transition or go to secret closets and we don't want you to teach them critical race theory that teach them America's evil and white people are evil and the whole white race is bad and needs to apologize.
[02:26:10.195 --> 02:26:14.138]  Huge overwhelming victory for Republicans on those issues.
[02:26:14.638 --> 02:26:19.501]  Every parent in America, every parent is on our side.
[02:26:20.021 --> 02:26:20.882]  Right again.
[02:26:21.362 --> 02:26:22.002]  Bullseye.
[02:26:22.342 --> 02:26:23.023]  Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:26:23.775 --> 02:26:28.202]  Rootforamerica.com and the email is wainroot at gmail.com.
[02:26:28.383 --> 02:26:29.044]  We'll see you in a sec.
[02:26:30.755 --> 02:26:36.479]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root, back again as your guest host every Tuesday afternoon here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:36.539 --> 02:26:40.101]  It's RootForAmerica.com and WayneRootAtGmail.com.
[02:26:40.121 --> 02:26:53.049]  My book, The Great Patriot Protest, and boycott book, which I think has had a big part, maybe not the whole reason, obviously all of you get the credit, millions of conservatives and Christians who have boycotted Disney.
[02:26:53.089 --> 02:26:58.449]   But my book has played a part in organizing the Christians and Patriots and Conservatives
[02:26:58.449 --> 02:27:03.009]   out there and a part in going after Disney and 115 other woke corporations because
[02:27:03.009 --> 02:27:06.929]   I give you all their contact information, how to attack, attack, attack.
[02:27:06.929 --> 02:27:08.489]  What do the Japanese say?
[02:27:08.489 --> 02:27:11.009]  Torah, Torah, Torah.
[02:27:11.009 --> 02:27:16.649]   Interesting that I brought that up because what's the first story in my pile here?
[02:27:16.646 --> 02:27:28.193]  Here's what happened to Disney's favorability since they announced that they're all in on transgender education and changing your kid's sex in kindergarten and beyond.
[02:27:28.733 --> 02:27:36.597]  And so, according to a new poll conducted by NBC News, and you know every poll conducted by NBC News is a fake news poll.
[02:27:36.637 --> 02:27:38.838]  You know they oversample Democrats, always.
[02:27:39.218 --> 02:27:42.280]  So whatever number they give you, it's even more in our favor.
[02:27:43.096 --> 02:27:50.358]  But just 33% of adults have a favorable opinion of Disney, says NBC, which means it's really in the 20s.
[02:27:51.578 --> 02:27:53.158]  15% hold a very positive view.
[02:27:53.179 --> 02:27:55.759]  30% neutral view.
[02:27:55.779 --> 02:27:58.600]  30% view Disney unfavorably.
[02:27:59.060 --> 02:28:06.562]  And what's most important is just in March of 2021, up on the screen, you'll see a Disney movie in March of 2021.
[02:28:08.725 --> 02:28:13.529]  They recorded, Disney recorded a very favorable view among Americans.
[02:28:13.549 --> 02:28:27.378]  77% said yes, very favorable, and only 21% a year ago said unfavorable, and today it's a 33% favorable rating.
[02:28:27.418 --> 02:28:28.739]  Disney is screwed.
[02:28:28.759 --> 02:28:30.280]  Disney is done.
[02:28:31.541 --> 02:28:34.203]  So, the mouse and the duck are screwed.
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:37.001]  Breaking news!
[02:28:37.061 --> 02:28:39.023]  Here I am laughing, now I've got to cry, right?
[02:28:39.063 --> 02:28:40.064]  From laughing to crying.
[02:28:40.844 --> 02:28:51.393]  Washington State gas stations have run out of gas and are adding, they're repairing their signs to add an extra digit in anticipation of $10 a gallon gas.
[02:28:53.473 --> 02:29:03.018]  Folks, I told you, I warned you when gas went to five and high fours and five and six dollars a gallon, and in California, seven dollars a gallon.
[02:29:03.478 --> 02:29:05.839]  I said it's going to go to ten dollars a gallon.
[02:29:06.239 --> 02:29:07.380]  This is Biden.
[02:29:07.420 --> 02:29:11.642]  And again, Biden's a brain dead zombie pocket puppet with dementia.
[02:29:11.922 --> 02:29:14.844]  So it's not really Biden, but it's the people behind him.
[02:29:14.884 --> 02:29:15.484]  It's Obama.
[02:29:15.524 --> 02:29:16.425]  It's Valerie Jarrett.
[02:29:16.785 --> 02:29:17.625]  It's George Soros.
[02:29:17.705 --> 02:29:18.966]  It's the Chinese Communist Party.
[02:29:19.286 --> 02:29:27.309]   It's Klaus Schwab, who are the communist Breaking down the United States of America.
[02:29:27.309 --> 02:29:30.109]  Purposely destroying your life and my life.
[02:29:30.109 --> 02:29:34.308]   And let me point out something even more horrible, and I don't know why the screen appears to
[02:29:34.308 --> 02:29:36.788]  have frozen, but something, are we still on?
[02:29:36.788 --> 02:29:37.788]  There we go.
[02:29:37.788 --> 02:29:41.269]  Something even more horrible than $10 a gallon gas.
[02:29:41.269 --> 02:29:48.189]   Do you realize home heating fuel, home heating oil, in the northeast United States, where
[02:29:48.189 --> 02:29:53.669]   I live in Las Vegas, in California when I lived there, in Park City, Utah, where I spent
[02:29:54.429 --> 02:29:56.370]  It's my second home, Park City, Utah.
[02:29:56.729 --> 02:30:01.350]   There's natural gas in everyone's house, and it's plentiful and it's cheap.
[02:30:01.350 --> 02:30:06.430]   But home heating oil is what you put in the ground underneath your home to heat your home
[02:30:06.430 --> 02:30:09.328]   in the Northeast United States, and all these old houses,
[02:30:09.328 --> 02:30:13.588]   which is almost every house in New York, and Philadelphia, and Boston, and Baltimore,
[02:30:13.588 --> 02:30:14.729]  and Washington, D.C.
[02:30:14.729 --> 02:30:19.529]   Everyone has home heating fuel, and those prices are gonna go through the roof
[02:30:19.529 --> 02:30:23.289]   just like gas to the point where one of my fans told me yesterday,
[02:30:23.289 --> 02:30:31.769]   it could cost $10,000 a winter to heat your house starting next winter based on the current price
[02:30:31.769 --> 02:30:36.609]   right now of home heating fuel, not even mentioning $10 gas in the state of Washington.
[02:30:36.835 --> 02:30:50.746]   At this moment, if the prices stay the same, he is telling me he lives in Connecticut In the suburbs of New York, he's telling me it would cost $10,000 to heat an average home in New York next winter.
[02:30:51.286 --> 02:30:52.887]  Folks, everyone's going to be bankrupt.
[02:30:52.927 --> 02:30:56.549]  No one can afford $10 gas, and no one can afford $10,000 to heat their home.
[02:30:56.909 --> 02:30:57.550]  They're going to freeze.
[02:30:57.670 --> 02:30:59.470]  Old people are going to freeze to death.
[02:30:59.631 --> 02:31:01.051]  Can you imagine if you've got Social Security?
[02:31:01.431 --> 02:31:06.174]  If you've got $1,200 a month, $1,500 a month, $2,000 a month, and then you've got to spend $10,000 on heating fuel?
[02:31:06.194 --> 02:31:06.534]  Come on.
[02:31:07.014 --> 02:31:07.555]  Impossible.
[02:31:07.815 --> 02:31:09.436]  No one's going to get in their car ever again for $10 gas.
[02:31:10.576 --> 02:31:18.685]  So this is a disaster of epic proportions all purposely intentionally caused by Joe Biden and the people behind him.
[02:31:19.046 --> 02:31:23.751]  The braindead zombie puppet who should be locked up in a mental institution for the rest of his life.
[02:31:24.091 --> 02:31:30.619]  Joe Biden who doesn't know the difference between his wife and his sister and his mother and probably gets his diapers changed several times a day at the White House.
[02:31:31.179 --> 02:31:42.603]  Him, he gets, you know, reserved my hatred to some extent, but I also feel bad and pity for him because he doesn't even know what he's doing as he dribbles on himself and takes orders from the Easter Bunny.
[02:31:43.063 --> 02:31:44.844]  And so, that's Joe Biden.
[02:31:45.164 --> 02:31:46.945]  Now let's go to the real people responsible.
[02:31:47.265 --> 02:31:52.527]  Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Susan Rice, George Soros, Klaus Schwab, and the Chinese Communist Party.
[02:31:52.987 --> 02:31:55.468]  They're trying to destroy the United States of America.
[02:31:55.928 --> 02:32:04.713]  How do you go from $2 gas under Trump to $10 gas under Joe Biden and all the people behind him, the communist scum behind him?
[02:32:05.113 --> 02:32:10.535]  This is a purposeful, intentional attempt to destroy the United States of America.
[02:32:10.595 --> 02:32:16.658]   Now throw in Besides gas and home heating oil, throw in baby formula.
[02:32:16.979 --> 02:32:21.963]  Do you realize they're now considering, the Biden administration, importing baby formula?
[02:32:21.983 --> 02:32:23.004]  Where will you import it from?
[02:32:23.385 --> 02:32:23.985]  China?
[02:32:24.446 --> 02:32:29.771]  The Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party are in control of the United States.
[02:32:30.311 --> 02:32:33.034]  You know, I put out a couple of humorous but true tweets the other day.
[02:32:34.276 --> 02:32:36.298]  But they're not tweets, because I'm banned for life from Twitter.
[02:32:36.598 --> 02:32:44.305]  So they're posts at Getter, which is now my favorite social media site, Getter, G-E-T-T-R, getter.com, or the Getter app.
[02:32:44.726 --> 02:32:46.027]  And I'm at, way en route.
[02:32:46.447 --> 02:32:57.718]  And I said, first of all, at this point, things are so bad, the only way I could see the United States surviving and being saved is if Elon Musk buys the United States for five cents on the dollar.
[02:32:58.158 --> 02:33:00.740]  So that's the first post I put out.
[02:33:01.160 --> 02:33:05.722]  Maybe, just maybe, we could be saved by Elon Musk the same way he's trying to buy Twitter.
[02:33:05.742 --> 02:33:06.663]  Maybe he could buy the U.S.
[02:33:06.683 --> 02:33:08.464]  government for five cents on the dollar.
[02:33:08.764 --> 02:33:17.869]  Then I put out another post and I said, come to think of it, Elon, if you're listening to me, you know, get ready to negotiate with the United States government for five cents on a dollar.
[02:33:17.929 --> 02:33:18.770]  Guess who you should call?
[02:33:19.110 --> 02:33:19.430]  China.
[02:33:19.930 --> 02:33:20.930]  Because that's who owns us.
[02:33:21.490 --> 02:33:23.971]  And so it's sad, it's funny, but it's sad.
[02:33:24.451 --> 02:33:27.192]  The key to funny and comedy is you got to have some truth.
[02:33:27.592 --> 02:33:28.432]  And it's definitely true.
[02:33:28.452 --> 02:33:31.873]  The United States of America is being ruled by people that want China.
[02:33:32.153 --> 02:33:35.054]  They want us weak and destroyed and impotent.
[02:33:35.474 --> 02:33:37.415]  And they want China to rule the world.
[02:33:37.795 --> 02:33:39.675]  And they've all been bought off by the Chinese.
[02:33:39.715 --> 02:33:45.657]  The Chinese have given them millions and millions or hundreds of millions or tens of millions in offshore bank accounts.
[02:33:45.697 --> 02:33:49.239]   They are the most corrupt People in the world, that is so clear.
[02:33:49.679 --> 02:33:58.845]  Everyone in the Biden administration and all the rhinos who hate Trump, they're all bought off by the Chinese Communist Party and George Soros and Klaus Schwab, the most disgusting people on earth.
[02:33:59.265 --> 02:34:01.827]  Horrible enemies of the United States of America.
[02:34:02.147 --> 02:34:04.088]  And this is an opinion show, and that's my opinion.
[02:34:04.369 --> 02:34:04.829]  There we go.
[02:34:05.129 --> 02:34:09.072]  And if you want to import baby formula, then you are the dumbest people in the world.
[02:34:09.372 --> 02:34:14.155]  And anybody who wants to import oil and all forms of energy are the dumbest people in the world.
[02:34:14.395 --> 02:34:16.697]  Or, or they're very smart.
[02:34:17.217 --> 02:34:19.198]  Very cunning, very vicious.
[02:34:19.238 --> 02:34:20.739]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:34:21.100 --> 02:34:24.882]  And they're taking this country down, as I learned at Columbia University.
[02:34:25.002 --> 02:34:27.004]  Cloward-Piven theory.
[02:34:27.304 --> 02:34:28.685]  Cloward-Piven philosophy.
[02:34:29.145 --> 02:34:31.827]  That's what's happening in the United States of America right now.
[02:34:31.887 --> 02:34:32.567]  They are smart.
[02:34:32.607 --> 02:34:33.188]  They are cunning.
[02:34:33.528 --> 02:34:34.248]  Not Joe Biden.
[02:34:34.548 --> 02:34:35.169]  He's a dummy.
[02:34:35.489 --> 02:34:36.230]  A wooden dummy.
[02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:38.311]  And the ventriloquists are really smart.
[02:34:38.671 --> 02:34:42.574]  And they're destroying the middle class, destroying small business, and destroying the U.S.
[02:34:42.614 --> 02:34:42.974]  economy.
[02:34:43.354 --> 02:34:45.555]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:45.575 --> 02:34:46.695]  We'll be back in a second.
[02:34:47.175 --> 02:34:49.336]  RootForAmerica.com is my website.
[02:34:49.736 --> 02:34:51.937]  WayneRootAtGmail.com is my email.
[02:34:52.417 --> 02:34:53.798]  And you can always email me there.
[02:34:53.838 --> 02:34:55.018]  WayneRootAtGmail.com.
[02:34:55.058 --> 02:34:55.858]  Love to hear from you.
[02:34:56.219 --> 02:34:59.760]  The newest member of the Nevada Broadcasting Hall of Fame.
[02:34:59.780 --> 02:35:00.420]  Yours truly.
[02:35:00.480 --> 02:35:01.581]  God bless America.
[02:35:02.021 --> 02:35:06.222]  Only in America can a son of a butcher achieve success in this great country.
[02:35:06.302 --> 02:35:07.042]  Don't root it!
[02:35:07.503 --> 02:35:08.463]  Fight for America!
[02:35:09.244 --> 02:35:16.407]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root, lots of emails have come in from fans of Alex Jones, and some of them are being converted to fans of Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:35:16.427 --> 02:35:17.307]  We appreciate that.
[02:35:18.008 --> 02:35:19.468]  Donald says, God bless you.
[02:35:19.548 --> 02:35:21.029]  Jesus is coming soon.
[02:35:22.509 --> 02:35:23.350]  Thank you, Donald.
[02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:25.751]  This guy is named Russell.
[02:35:25.771 --> 02:35:28.872]  He says, love catching you on Band.Video.
[02:35:28.912 --> 02:35:32.754]  Congratulations on your induction in the Nevada Broadcasters Hall of Fame.
[02:35:32.814 --> 02:35:33.534]  You are the GOAT.
[02:35:34.254 --> 02:35:35.795]  Goat, of course, means greatest of all time.
[02:35:35.855 --> 02:35:36.315]  Thank you.
[02:35:36.795 --> 02:35:38.256]  Appreciate that, Russell.
[02:35:38.916 --> 02:35:40.277]  We've got Michael.
[02:35:40.657 --> 02:35:46.120]  From now on, whenever you mention Mitt Romney's name, refer to him as Willard the Rat.
[02:35:46.500 --> 02:35:48.441]  His real name is Willard Romney, right?
[02:35:48.501 --> 02:35:49.942]  It's Willard the Rat.
[02:35:51.062 --> 02:35:53.683]  And so Mark says, good afternoon, Mr. Root.
[02:35:54.303 --> 02:35:56.683]  My three boys and I live in Orange County, California.
[02:35:56.723 --> 02:36:01.844]  They are homeschooled and they are, we have all read the homeschool to Harvard article by you.
[02:36:02.464 --> 02:36:05.044]  And my boys are actually taking fencing lessons too.
[02:36:05.545 --> 02:36:06.545]  We love Nevada.
[02:36:06.565 --> 02:36:07.585]  We might relocate.
[02:36:07.625 --> 02:36:09.245]  What do you think of Henderson or Summerlin?
[02:36:09.665 --> 02:36:10.925]  Would you still recommend it?
[02:36:11.486 --> 02:36:14.426]  And I brought up that last one because I'll give you advice right on the air.
[02:36:15.486 --> 02:36:20.047]  First of all, let me start with why he's asking, why he's mentioning homeschool to Harvard.
[02:36:20.780 --> 02:36:30.488]  Because my daughter was homeschooled her entire life and she made it accepted to Harvard and Stanford and Yale and all the best colleges in America, Brown and Duke and Penn.
[02:36:31.209 --> 02:36:38.275]  Every great Stanford, every great college in America accepted my daughter Dakota and she's about to become Dr. Dakota Root and she was homeschooled.
[02:36:38.875 --> 02:36:45.061]  And my son Hudson was homeschooled and he just graduated SMU with honors in the Cox School of Business.
[02:36:45.581 --> 02:36:47.523]  So there's your proof that homeschooling works.
[02:36:48.044 --> 02:36:59.675]  Much better to not let your kids be brainwashed in public schools by communist teachers that are members of the teachers union, only care about their paycheck and brainwashing your children, could not care less about educating your children.
[02:37:00.076 --> 02:37:04.080]  And so we did it the homeschool way and my kids turned out pretty darn good.
[02:37:04.400 --> 02:37:07.323]  And my daughter was one of the fencing champions of the United States of America.
[02:37:07.442 --> 02:37:09.082]  and all Ivy League in fencing.
[02:37:09.082 --> 02:37:11.602]  That's why he mentions his kids are in fencing.
[02:37:11.602 --> 02:37:14.563]   Yes, would I recommend, well, would I recommend homeschooling?
[02:37:14.563 --> 02:37:15.483]  Let's start with that.
[02:37:15.483 --> 02:37:17.461]  Yes, homeschooling's great.
[02:37:17.461 --> 02:37:19.262]  Would I recommend Nevada?
[02:37:19.262 --> 02:37:21.881]  That's a very different question.
[02:37:21.916 --> 02:37:23.757]  I'll give you a very nuanced answer.
[02:37:24.437 --> 02:37:24.857]  Maybe.
[02:37:25.358 --> 02:37:26.658]  Yes and maybe no.
[02:37:27.158 --> 02:37:29.859]  Let's wait to see what happens in the November election.
[02:37:30.379 --> 02:37:34.081]  Because if Nevada stays Democrat, that means the system is rigged.
[02:37:34.101 --> 02:37:37.022]  There's going to be a red Republican wave all over the United States.
[02:37:37.062 --> 02:37:37.642]  But guess what?
[02:37:38.062 --> 02:37:43.004]  In almost every state where Trump won big in a landslide, you and I know he won big in a landslide.
[02:37:43.704 --> 02:37:46.367]  Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Arizona.
[02:37:46.407 --> 02:37:49.710]  But it looks like he lost because they rigged and stole the election.
[02:37:50.170 --> 02:37:54.574]  In all of those states, they have tightened up the rules of voting.
[02:37:54.974 --> 02:37:58.818]  And it's not so easy to steal the election as it was a couple of years ago.
[02:38:00.139 --> 02:38:04.203]  Because all of them have Republican legislatures and or Republican governors or both.
[02:38:04.867 --> 02:38:17.263]  But, when you get to Nevada, we have a Democrat governor, Democrat lieutenant governor, Democrat treasurer, Democrat everything, and a Democrat legislature, Democrat assembly, Democrat state senate.
[02:38:18.382 --> 02:38:20.983]  Democrat Attorney General, they're all rats.
[02:38:21.623 --> 02:38:26.485]  And so we've not only not changed anything, but Nevada's gotten worse.
[02:38:27.066 --> 02:38:39.711]  We have legalized, not we being me, but the Nevada Legislature and the Governor signed it into law since the election, legalized ballot harvesting and legalized mail-in ballots forevermore.
[02:38:40.777 --> 02:38:55.696]  Now, we just got, good people that are my friends, just got on the ballot, a judge approved on the ballot, if they get the signatures between now and September, they'll be on the ballot for voter ID in Nevada.
[02:38:56.156 --> 02:38:57.397]  That would change everything.
[02:38:57.417 --> 02:39:08.721]  This is a red Republican state that has turned blue based only on stolen elections, rigged elections, and illegal aliens voting by the tens if not hundreds of thousands.
[02:39:09.241 --> 02:39:14.883]  If we can get true, strict photo voter ID, we win elections again.
[02:39:14.963 --> 02:39:21.185]  But first, he's got to get enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, but at least he's approved to do that now.
[02:39:22.259 --> 02:39:26.884]  And then it's going to be on the ballot in November, but then it needs to be on two ballots in a row.
[02:39:27.244 --> 02:39:28.606]  So it's got to be on this year and then in 2024.
[02:39:29.066 --> 02:39:37.135]  And if it's ratified and agreed to by the voters during both those elections, then Nevada has voter ID forevermore.
[02:39:37.737 --> 02:39:47.030]  But do you have any idea how rigged the elections will be in 2022 this November and in 2024 when they know it's their last chance to kill voter ID?
[02:39:47.130 --> 02:39:53.331]   So they're gonna bring out every illegal alien and every stolen, you know, every stolen fake
[02:39:53.331 --> 02:40:00.620]   Ballot they can find with no voter ID and no signature Verification and they're gonna flood the market with fake
[02:40:00.620 --> 02:40:06.399]   ballots and they're gonna steal every single Election they can between now and then so there may never
[02:40:06.399 --> 02:40:11.849]   be voter ID in this state and everything may not change And we may have an all-blue state forevermore
[02:40:11.849 --> 02:40:16.469]   So when you ask me move to Nevada, the question is who controls, Nevada?
[02:40:16.469 --> 02:40:18.950]  I will stay here for the time being.
[02:40:18.984 --> 02:40:23.925]  I have the most dominant radio show ever in afternoon drive in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[02:40:24.426 --> 02:40:31.248]  Every conservative Republican listens to Wade Allerud every afternoon in drive time from 3 to 6 on the way home from work.
[02:40:31.947 --> 02:40:36.347]   And that's great. I don't want to rebuild that somewhere else. My show is then nationally syndicated all over the
[02:40:36.347 --> 02:40:39.847]   country, but it's based in Las Vegas and there is a tremendous
[02:40:39.847 --> 02:40:40.947]  success here in Vegas.
[02:40:40.947 --> 02:40:44.447]   That's why I just was inducted into Nevada Broadcaster's Hall of Fame.
[02:40:44.447 --> 02:40:46.447]  I don't want to go anywhere if I don't have to.
[02:40:46.447 --> 02:40:50.447]   But if it remains a blue state with a blue governor and a blue legislature.
[02:40:50.389 --> 02:40:54.331]  And they vote in an income tax.
[02:40:54.411 --> 02:40:55.692]  Right now the income tax is zero.
[02:40:56.152 --> 02:41:02.957]  And they vote in taking away the cap on property taxes, which could dramatically increase our property taxes in Las Vegas and Nevada.
[02:41:03.457 --> 02:41:06.978]  Well then I will move to somewhere like Texas or Utah or Florida.
[02:41:07.278 --> 02:41:08.858]  Those are the three states in consideration.
[02:41:09.198 --> 02:41:10.339]  I love Park City, Utah.
[02:41:10.699 --> 02:41:13.419]  I love Dallas, Texas and the whole suburbs of Dallas.
[02:41:13.780 --> 02:41:17.640]  And I love the whole area around Boca Raton and Palm Beach, Florida.
[02:41:18.001 --> 02:41:19.961]  So those are my choices in the future.
[02:41:19.981 --> 02:41:27.163]   I absolutely could leave Las Vegas if Things get bad and it remains blue and gets worse blue.
[02:41:27.483 --> 02:41:29.404]  And they vote in all kinds of tax increases.
[02:41:29.824 --> 02:41:32.125]  I will say, hasta la vista, Nevada.
[02:41:32.445 --> 02:41:33.385]  And that will be the end of it.
[02:41:33.425 --> 02:41:34.005]  But I love it.
[02:41:34.546 --> 02:41:34.946]  I love it.
[02:41:34.966 --> 02:41:35.726]  I don't want to leave.
[02:41:35.826 --> 02:41:39.627]  And everywhere I go, I'm mobbed by fans and people scream war wherever I go.
[02:41:39.927 --> 02:41:41.528]  And every restaurant gives me free meals.
[02:41:41.588 --> 02:41:42.248]  It's a great life.
[02:41:42.648 --> 02:41:43.249]  I love it here.
[02:41:43.649 --> 02:41:44.429]  And I don't want to run.
[02:41:44.769 --> 02:41:45.209]  Believe me.
[02:41:45.489 --> 02:41:46.390]  But I may have no choice.
[02:41:46.410 --> 02:41:48.090]  So there's my answer about Nevada.
[02:41:48.130 --> 02:41:50.251]  Now, let's get to the big story of the day.
[02:41:50.591 --> 02:41:51.431]  I've waited and waited.
[02:41:51.451 --> 02:41:52.792]  Now it's time to get to the big story.
[02:41:53.192 --> 02:41:56.813]  And that is, over the weekend, the leading Democrat for U.S.
[02:41:56.853 --> 02:42:05.856]  Senate in Pennsylvania, a young guy, looks really young, he's 53 years old, but looks in his 40s, and he had a stroke!
[02:42:06.476 --> 02:42:10.317]  And he's bragged that he's triple jabbed online, or on social media.
[02:42:10.897 --> 02:42:12.577]  And a Democrat U.S.
[02:42:12.637 --> 02:42:19.911]   Senator from Maryland, Who is young, and looks young, and is actually 63, and I'm 60, so he's in my age range.
[02:42:20.292 --> 02:42:21.773]  He had a stroke over the weekend!
[02:42:22.093 --> 02:42:23.435]  And you know he's triple jabbed!
[02:42:23.855 --> 02:42:26.177]  You know, every Democrat Senator's triple jabbed!
[02:42:26.517 --> 02:42:28.839]  Every Democrat candidate's triple jabbed!
[02:42:29.100 --> 02:42:29.960]  They're all morons!
[02:42:30.421 --> 02:42:33.864]  And they all believe government, and government's always wrong, not always right, always wrong!
[02:42:34.444 --> 02:42:35.305]  And so there he is.
[02:42:35.846 --> 02:42:36.787]  What is it, Chris Van Hollen?
[02:42:36.827 --> 02:42:37.268]  I think it is.
[02:42:37.548 --> 02:42:40.672]  Yes, Senator Chris Van Hollen, 63 years old, U.S.
[02:42:40.712 --> 02:42:43.796]  Senator Maryland, and John Fetterman, U.S.
[02:42:43.856 --> 02:42:47.260]  Senate candidate, the leading Democrat in the primary, by a mile.
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:49.643]  So he will win the nomination in Pennsylvania.
[02:42:50.023 --> 02:42:51.725]  And both of them had a stroke over the weekend.
[02:42:52.066 --> 02:43:13.437]   And I just want to state publicly That I would bet any amount of money on earth that they're both triple vaccinated and they both, you know, the stroke was brought on by the spike proteins that cause blood clots that fill up your veins and attach to your organs and cause heart attacks, strokes, blood clots, and massive increase in cancer among a hundred other disabilities.
[02:43:13.757 --> 02:43:28.305]   But those are the big ones in every single case that you read about side effects at the VAERS list, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or if you read about it in the Pfizer Clinical trials that they wanted to keep secret for 75 years.
[02:43:28.645 --> 02:43:31.147]  Now they've come out, it turns out 1200 people died.
[02:43:31.547 --> 02:43:34.630]  It turns out lots of people had heart attacks, lots of people had strokes.
[02:43:34.950 --> 02:43:37.191]  The number of deaths were astounding.
[02:43:37.652 --> 02:43:50.701]  Nobody in their right, there's Fetterman, nobody in their right mind would take the vaccine if they knew those vaccine side effects from the clinical trials that were not released and they covered them up and the FDA covered up with them.
[02:43:51.101 --> 02:43:57.609]   When I get back, In the next segment, I've got lots more COVID vaccine news that is going to knock your socks off.
[02:43:57.990 --> 02:44:08.119]  And I want to tell you about a show that I just watched, a documentary about Meltdown, Three Mile Island, that is identical to everything that's happening today with the COVID vaccine.
[02:44:08.579 --> 02:44:16.185]  The government oversight by the Nuclear Regulatory Agency versus the oversight by the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration of vaccines.
[02:44:16.646 --> 02:44:17.726]  It's the same thing.
[02:44:18.067 --> 02:44:20.489]  Corruption, corruption, corruption.
[02:44:20.909 --> 02:44:21.890]  Dirty tactics.
[02:44:22.290 --> 02:44:26.033]  Lots of people sick or dying and nobody willing to tell you the truth.
[02:44:26.513 --> 02:44:30.336]  Three Mile Island compared to the COVID vaccine.
[02:44:30.356 --> 02:44:33.679]  That's probably gonna be my next column and I'll talk about it when I get back.
[02:44:34.059 --> 02:44:38.580]  Wayne Allyn Root, RootForAmerica.com, WayneRoot at gmail.com.
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:49.202]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root on the Alex Jones Show, guest host on Tuesdays in this hour, the fourth hour, which is 12 noon to 1 o'clock West Coast time, and 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock East Coast time.
[02:44:49.222 --> 02:44:50.022]  Great to be with you!
[02:44:50.502 --> 02:44:53.942]  RootForAmerica.com is my website, my national radio show, Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:44:54.283 --> 02:44:57.543]  We're on unfiltered, which you can find there on my website.
[02:44:57.603 --> 02:45:02.524]  I'm negotiating right now, and I should be able to announce soon, a Wayne Allyn Root national TV show.
[02:45:03.224 --> 02:45:07.486]  And of course, you can always email me, waynerootatgmail.com.
[02:45:07.526 --> 02:45:16.411]  By the way, one of the columns I'm working on for the future, I told you, I'm comparing Three Mile Island to COVID-19 vaccines, and I'll talk about that in a minute.
[02:45:16.751 --> 02:45:23.174]  But I'm also writing a column, probably for this weekend, and it's called, I Am Proud to be Ultramaga.
[02:45:23.594 --> 02:45:25.175]  I love the name Ultramaga!
[02:45:25.595 --> 02:45:26.816]  I am Ultramaga!
[02:45:27.076 --> 02:45:28.477]  It's great, we're all Ultramaga!
[02:45:29.133 --> 02:45:32.738]  But I want to define what ultra Biden means.
[02:45:33.257 --> 02:45:41.257]   Ultra Biden means gas lines and $10 gas and home heating oil that will make you homeless
[02:45:41.257 --> 02:45:46.777]   and open borders that will destroy the United States and leaving $85 billion of equipment
[02:45:46.777 --> 02:45:53.417]   on the ground in Afghanistan and destruction in Ukraine and giving them $40 billion extra
[02:45:53.417 --> 02:45:59.378]   and in general $60 billion of our money and cities that are crime ridden with murder rates
[02:45:59.378 --> 02:46:04.417]   going through the roof and drug needles and poop and pee all over the streets and homeless
[02:46:04.417 --> 02:46:06.097]  tents everywhere.
[02:46:06.097 --> 02:46:11.336]   That's Biden and forced vaccine mandates that will kill our kids with no benefit.
[02:46:11.822 --> 02:46:13.284]  That's ultra Biden.
[02:46:13.704 --> 02:46:15.366]  So forget ultra MAGA.
[02:46:15.727 --> 02:46:18.790]  Joe Biden thought he was defeating us for six months.
[02:46:18.830 --> 02:46:20.292]  He hired a company that worked on this.
[02:46:20.692 --> 02:46:31.199]  For six months to come up with a slogan he could use to destroy Trump voters and these braindead morons came up with Ultra MAGA like that's an insult.
[02:46:31.499 --> 02:46:32.040]  We love it!
[02:46:32.460 --> 02:46:33.200]  Victory!
[02:46:33.581 --> 02:46:34.862]  We are Ultra MAGA!
[02:46:35.182 --> 02:46:36.443]  God bless Ultra MAGA!
[02:46:36.663 --> 02:46:37.884]  You know what MAGA represents?
[02:46:38.264 --> 02:46:45.969]  That list I just gave you of Ultra Biden is the worst crap that's ever happened in the history of America, the middle class, and the US economy.
[02:46:46.924 --> 02:46:50.039]  And the Army, and the Navy, and the Military, and Foreign Affairs!
[02:46:50.119 --> 02:46:50.823]  The worst ever!
[02:46:51.545 --> 02:46:52.906]  And what is UltraMAGA?
[02:46:53.246 --> 02:46:58.229]  The best economy ever, the best growth for middle class people, middle class income, middle class jobs.
[02:46:58.669 --> 02:47:03.031]  And how about the lowest unemployment ever for black and Latinos in the history of America?
[02:47:03.351 --> 02:47:06.093]  My God, UltraMAGA is something to be proud of.
[02:47:06.493 --> 02:47:11.416]  UltraBiden, you might as well slit your wrists living in a country run by UltraBiden.
[02:47:11.756 --> 02:47:13.717]  So I'll be writing that column for this weekend.
[02:47:14.017 --> 02:47:19.740]  And then probably next week's column will be comparing COVID-19 vaccines to Three Mile Island.
[02:47:20.182 --> 02:47:21.913]  So let me tell you about the latest surveys.
[02:47:22.416 --> 02:47:22.879]  First of all...
[02:47:23.951 --> 02:47:28.795]  I've developed a great friendship with another radio, actually a podcaster.
[02:47:29.235 --> 02:47:33.779]  A podcaster and his name is Ben Armstrong and he's a guest on my show all the time now.
[02:47:34.179 --> 02:47:38.223]  And he comes up with great COVID-19 vaccine statistics.
[02:47:38.623 --> 02:47:41.245]  The only ones in the whole country that are doing this are me and him.
[02:47:41.625 --> 02:47:44.107]  And you can name like two more on your hand and that's it.
[02:47:44.648 --> 02:47:46.990]  And so Ben Armstrong, kudos to you, great job.
[02:47:47.490 --> 02:47:52.274]  Ben has come up with the following stat from the CDC of the UK, of England.
[02:47:52.794 --> 02:48:03.482]  Their CDC has studied 100,000 young people in England who got the vaccine versus 100,000 young people who didn't get the vaccine, i.e.
[02:48:03.522 --> 02:48:04.863]  they're unvaccinated.
[02:48:05.223 --> 02:48:07.825]  So this is a perfect apples-to-apples study.
[02:48:08.265 --> 02:48:09.226]  And guess what they found?
[02:48:09.706 --> 02:48:20.934]  According to the Office for National Statistics of the United Kingdom, fully vaccinated young adults are 92% more likely to die than unvaccinated adults.
[02:48:21.835 --> 02:48:22.095]  What?
[02:48:22.699 --> 02:48:23.259]  There you go.
[02:48:23.279 --> 02:48:27.942]  92% more likely that your children will die.
[02:48:27.962 --> 02:48:30.003]  And I don't think that's die from COVID.
[02:48:30.363 --> 02:48:35.466]  That's die from any source once they're vaccinated versus kids who are unvaccinated.
[02:48:35.946 --> 02:48:43.190]  Who would be cruel enough, abusive enough, stupid enough, ignorant enough to give their child this vaccine?
[02:48:43.611 --> 02:48:44.251]  My God.
[02:48:45.356 --> 02:48:47.117]  OK, another survey.
[02:48:47.637 --> 02:48:51.618]  So this was a survey done and it's it's literally 20 pages.
[02:48:51.658 --> 02:48:52.918]  I have no time to read it all to you.
[02:48:53.318 --> 02:48:54.459]  Just take my word for it.
[02:48:54.819 --> 02:49:02.381]  It's by a brilliant scientific mind who thought of everything you could to make sure it's impeachable.
[02:49:03.101 --> 02:49:07.182]  Literally nobody could ever attack the study in any way, shape or form.
[02:49:07.642 --> 02:49:09.963]  And he had 400 independent observers.
[02:49:10.303 --> 02:49:11.403]  It's been peer reviewed.
[02:49:11.843 --> 02:49:19.508]   And he believes, based on his study, That the COVID vaccines have killed over a half million Americans.
[02:49:19.528 --> 02:49:23.411]  500,000 dead Americans after getting the COVID vaccine.
[02:49:23.471 --> 02:49:35.621]  Now, the latest numbers are out from the VAERS report, Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, and they show just under 30,000 dead Americans directly from the COVID vaccine.
[02:49:35.661 --> 02:49:39.524]  Not from COVID, hear what I'm saying, from the COVID vaccine.
[02:49:40.177 --> 02:49:51.293]  But Columbia University, and I'm an alma mater of Columbia, as liberal as they are, their medical school researchers studied the last several decades of vaccine reporting.
[02:49:51.756 --> 02:49:56.716]   on the VAERS report and they came up with the fact that you need to multiply by a minimum
[02:49:56.716 --> 02:50:02.836]   of 20 to get the correct number because so many doctors will never report somebody dying
[02:50:02.836 --> 02:50:03.836]  to VAERS and bother.
[02:50:03.836 --> 02:50:08.516]   They don't have time to fill out a one-hour report about how the person died and why the
[02:50:08.516 --> 02:50:11.197]  person died and nobody cares as they fill it out.
[02:50:11.197 --> 02:50:14.037]  No one in their family even knows about the VAERS report.
[02:50:14.037 --> 02:50:15.676]  So the doctors don't do it.
[02:50:15.676 --> 02:50:20.236]   So you have to multiply by 20 because a tiny proportion of deaths are actually reported
[02:50:20.236 --> 02:50:23.916]   of theirs and they say multiply by 20 to get an accurate reading.
[02:50:24.220 --> 02:50:27.662]  Well, what's 30,000 admitted dead on the VAERS report times 20?
[02:50:28.602 --> 02:50:31.124]  It's 600,000 dead in the United States of America.
[02:50:31.464 --> 02:50:33.485]  And it's slightly below 30,000 right now.
[02:50:33.645 --> 02:50:34.546]  It's 28,000 or so.
[02:50:34.966 --> 02:50:47.253]  So, like, it's like 560,000 to 70,000 dead in the United States from the vaccine based on Columbia researchers, based on Harvard researchers, who did the same study several years back.
[02:50:47.714 --> 02:50:49.395]  They said you have to multiply times 100!
[02:50:49.435 --> 02:50:49.395]  100!
[02:50:49.454 --> 02:50:56.815]   100, 100, they said only 1% of deaths are ever reported from vaccines are ever reported to VAERS.
[02:50:56.815 --> 02:51:03.054]   So multiply times 100, 28,000 deaths, that's 2.8 million dead Americans from the vaccine.
[02:51:03.054 --> 02:51:09.215]   I'll take the far lower figure and I'll say, it's certainly accurate to say 500,000 or more Americans
[02:51:09.215 --> 02:51:11.375]  are dead from the COVID vaccine.
[02:51:11.375 --> 02:51:17.134]   And one thing we know for sure from CDC numbers, the death rate among millennials,
[02:51:17.134 --> 02:51:22.134]  young, healthy, fit Americans is up 83% or maybe it's 86%.
[02:51:22.722 --> 02:51:23.423]  It's in the 80s.
[02:51:23.823 --> 02:51:30.147]  It's up 80 plus percent from the year before the COVID vaccine to the year that the COVID vaccine came out.
[02:51:30.647 --> 02:51:34.530]  Young people are dying in record numbers, unbelievable numbers.
[02:51:34.570 --> 02:51:36.631]  Now, some more studies you need to know.
[02:51:37.311 --> 02:51:51.558]  New peer-reviewed study finds that Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine protection against Omicron wanes, meaning it weakens and goes away, a week after receiving the second and third dose.
[02:51:52.158 --> 02:52:02.863]  So you could be killing yourself, crippling yourself, or permanently disabling yourself for a vaccine that Pfizer themselves admits goes away in a week.
[02:52:03.689 --> 02:52:06.071]  Wow, that is the scariest thing I've ever heard.
[02:52:06.091 --> 02:52:12.656]  And a new study finds a positive correlation between higher mask usage and COVID-19 deaths.
[02:52:13.176 --> 02:52:21.022]  And this study studied 602 million Europeans in 35 European countries.
[02:52:21.563 --> 02:52:31.528]   And this study is peer-reviewed and it shows that there is zero effect In countries that wear the most masks are not getting COVID versus countries that wear no masks.
[02:52:31.968 --> 02:52:33.408]  So it doesn't do a damn thing.
[02:52:33.829 --> 02:52:40.071]  But it shows a slight increase in deaths in the countries that wear the most masks, deaths from COVID.
[02:52:40.391 --> 02:52:43.492]  And of course, the mask is giving you no oxygen.
[02:52:44.582 --> 02:52:49.164]  And if you're a doctor who changes your mask 30 times a day in a sterile operating room, now that's fine.
[02:52:49.725 --> 02:52:56.508]  But if you are a person in the real world who's busy or a child in the real world, you're going to never change your mask.
[02:52:56.528 --> 02:52:57.809]  You're going to keep the same one all day.
[02:52:57.849 --> 02:53:00.250]  First of all, you can't afford to change 50 of them a day.
[02:53:00.270 --> 02:53:02.391]  So you keep one dirty, filthy mask.
[02:53:02.671 --> 02:53:07.233]  You put it in your pocket with your keys and your cell phone, which is filthy as a toilet bowl cover.
[02:53:07.473 --> 02:53:10.895]  And then you put it on your mouth, which is why some of us call it a face diaper.
[02:53:11.355 --> 02:53:27.008]  And so you're breathing in the worst dirt and disease known to man from your keys and your cell phone and your filthy pocket and the filthy middle section of your car or your filthy place where you keep your DMV registration in your car.
[02:53:27.729 --> 02:53:31.912]  Wherever you keep your mask, I guarantee you it's filthy and you're putting that on your face.
[02:53:32.313 --> 02:53:33.634]  Of course people die.
[02:53:34.014 --> 02:53:39.236]  After breathing in their own poisonous air and they're coughing and they're sneezing and it goes right back in their lungs.
[02:53:39.596 --> 02:53:40.576]  How disgusting.
[02:53:40.876 --> 02:53:42.197]  Of course masks don't work.
[02:53:42.237 --> 02:53:44.818]  Of course lockdowns have never worked in world history.
[02:53:45.078 --> 02:53:46.758]  Of course vaccines are killing people.
[02:53:47.079 --> 02:53:49.800]  And I just watched the documentary about Three Mile Island.
[02:53:50.120 --> 02:53:52.560]  I guess I'll have to save that for next week because we're running out of time.
[02:53:52.841 --> 02:53:54.581]  But I'll give you a very quick synopsis.
[02:53:55.121 --> 02:53:57.122]  The government lied about everything.
[02:53:57.562 --> 02:54:02.624]  The National Nuclear Agency lied about everything.
[02:54:03.707 --> 02:54:12.074]  And so did the corporation that owned the nuclear plant, lied about everything and risked everybody's life and lied to them about Three Mile Island.
[02:54:12.094 --> 02:54:12.995]  They all could have died.
[02:54:13.315 --> 02:54:15.557]  The entire East Coast of the United States could have been destroyed.
[02:54:15.937 --> 02:54:19.260]  And they lied and fooled and committed fraud in front of everyone.
[02:54:19.580 --> 02:54:22.382]  The government and the corporation reminds me of the COVID vaccine.
[02:54:22.702 --> 02:54:28.167]  The FDA provides no oversight, just like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, provides no oversight.
[02:54:28.627 --> 02:54:39.214]  And the corporations that create the vaccines, Big Pharma are lying, just like the nuclear power companies are lying in one big conspiracy, and the media doesn't say a word.
[02:54:39.614 --> 02:54:45.137]  It's eerie how much is in common between Three Mile Island disaster and this COVID-19 disaster.
[02:54:45.157 --> 02:54:46.338]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:54:46.698 --> 02:54:48.579]  RootforAmerica.com is the website.
[02:54:48.880 --> 02:54:52.822]  Find my radio show at RootforAmerica.com or usaradio.com.
[02:54:53.222 --> 02:54:55.864]  And you can email me anytime, wayneroot at gmail.com.
[02:54:56.344 --> 02:55:00.148]  I provide the truth, something very few people do in America today.
[02:55:00.528 --> 02:55:01.409]  Alex Jones does it.
[02:55:01.749 --> 02:55:02.970]  Thank you, Alex, for having me on.
[02:55:03.311 --> 02:55:04.011]  God bless you all.
[02:55:04.031 --> 02:55:10.037]  My book, The Great Patriot Protest, and boycott book, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, are RootForAmerica.com.
[02:55:10.076 --> 02:55:21.435]  See you next week.
[02:55:22.054 --> 02:55:27.135]  We've had a huge, huge effect when it comes to the fight against the globalists.
[02:55:28.175 --> 02:55:29.476]  And we've changed the world together.
[02:55:30.476 --> 02:55:40.618]  And I want to thank you for all you've done over the years with your prayers, your word of mouth, and shopping with us, and supporting us, while at the same time getting great products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:55:41.966 --> 02:56:00.690]  But now because of supply chain breakdowns and now because of all the Democratic Party funded lawsuits and the slanted nature of those attacks, we are maxed out and pushed up against a wall, just like America is pushed up against a wall.
[02:56:00.750 --> 02:56:05.551]  And we're being bullied, we're being brutalized by the special interests that want to get through us.
[02:56:06.630 --> 02:56:07.670]  To be able to get to you.
[02:56:07.750 --> 02:56:16.532]  So if we put today's live show headline up on screen for TV viewers and ask the question, did Alex Jones Infowars declare bankruptcy?
[02:56:17.493 --> 02:56:18.533]  Tune in and learn the truth.
[02:56:18.653 --> 02:56:45.201]   If you scroll down in that live show feed today, you'll find a subsection that's on InfowarsStore.com where when you click on it, it takes you to a sub page And InfoWarsTore.com, where you can make a $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 one-time donation, or you can sign up for a recurring donation cancel any time.
[02:56:45.901 --> 02:56:54.246]  But this is the time in the fight for freedom to understand they're going to take everything from you if you don't start spending time and energy in the fight.
[02:56:54.547 --> 02:56:58.229]  And I'm not talking to regular listeners that have supported us over the years and done a great job.
[02:56:58.489 --> 02:57:03.474]   I'm talking to new listeners or occasional listeners You need to understand.
[02:57:04.454 --> 02:57:14.042]  This is a serious situation we're in and you need to put skin in the game financially to keep operations on the air like Infowars.
[02:57:14.502 --> 02:57:22.028]  Think of the millions of people that learned about ivermectin and zinc and vitamin D and hydroxychloroquine alone from this show.
[02:57:22.388 --> 02:57:26.832]  Think about the pedophile drag queen story times that have been exposed and stopped by this broadcast.
[02:57:27.573 --> 02:57:32.497]  Think about our border reports exposing the human smuggling that triggered congressional investigations.
[02:57:33.257 --> 02:57:35.798]  Think about our anti-war reporting.
[02:57:35.898 --> 02:57:41.079]  Think about our 9-11 and Bohemian Grove and our reporting on the globalists and the occult.
[02:57:41.379 --> 02:57:49.000]  I mean, to try to list our exposure of fluoride in the water and atrazine and the attack on our children with the whole transgender cult.
[02:57:49.620 --> 02:57:54.721]  Think about everything we've been through together and just imagine InfoWars not being there.
[02:57:55.681 --> 02:58:06.063]   So I want to ask you to go to InfoWarsStore.com And every day during the live show, under the live show feed, we'll have a link to it as well, where you can donate, and we can buy products.
[02:58:06.163 --> 02:58:12.887]  And again, all the t-shirts, all the apparel, all the ball caps, all the flags, some of it going back, some of the stuff's been in the warehouse five years.
[02:58:13.848 --> 02:58:16.770]  Over 100 designs, great shirts, great ball caps, you name it.
[02:58:16.810 --> 02:58:18.031]  We're selling it all at cost.
[02:58:18.431 --> 02:58:22.974]  In the future, we're just going to have limited edition shirts for a limited time, only a few designs at a time.
[02:58:24.292 --> 02:58:26.913]  Because we can't sit there and pay for the larger inventory.
[02:58:26.953 --> 02:58:27.733]  We just can't do it.
[02:58:28.174 --> 02:58:29.554]  So, one-of-a-kind shirts.
[02:58:29.574 --> 02:58:30.695]  Get them at InfoWars.com.
[02:58:30.735 --> 02:58:34.276]  And the new Alex Jones Was Right shirt.
[02:58:34.536 --> 02:58:35.417]  Very good looking shirt.
[02:58:35.757 --> 02:58:36.677]  Big red thunderbolt.
[02:58:36.737 --> 02:58:38.278]  Alex Jones Was Right on the back.
[02:58:38.918 --> 02:58:40.078]  InfoWars.com.
[02:58:40.339 --> 02:58:41.659]  This is a limited edition shirt.
[02:58:42.499 --> 02:58:44.640]  We're only selling this limited edition for one month.
[02:58:45.361 --> 02:58:48.842]  And it's $24.95, so we get $18 from the sales.
[02:58:48.882 --> 02:58:49.622]  It's really nice fabric.
[02:58:49.642 --> 02:58:50.843]  It's an expensive shirt for us to make.
[02:58:52.176 --> 02:58:54.677]  The only way we fail is if you don't take action.
[02:58:54.697 --> 02:58:57.778]  When we get together and stand up against the globalists, we are unstoppable.
[02:58:57.798 --> 02:58:58.438]  I'm counting on you.
[02:58:58.458 --> 02:58:58.838]  Stay with us.
