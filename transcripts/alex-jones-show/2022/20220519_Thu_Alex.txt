[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:00.549]  It's on.
[00:00:00.769 --> 00:00:02.270]  The fight between good and evil is here.
[00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.011]  And a lot of people in the power structure have decided to not join with the New World Order.
[00:00:07.391 --> 00:00:09.132]  Now they see just how damn evil it is.
[00:00:09.152 --> 00:00:14.633]  Because we're now down to the point of literally cutting off the food, the water, not just the baby formula, the electricity.
[00:00:16.254 --> 00:00:18.594]  That's how they're going to win their fight against us is shut everything down.
[00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:21.115]  And what I'm saying is life and death.
[00:00:21.295 --> 00:00:23.716]  So please, just take a moment.
[00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:25.356]  Imagine you can hear a pin drop.
[00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:36.472]   Because I want what I'm about to say to really get home, okay?
[00:00:36.472 --> 00:00:42.353]   If the globalists think they can get away with their operation, they're going to do it.
[00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:48.473]  And they've already done a stress test in the last two years with the COVID lockdowns as a beta test for the next big move.
[00:00:49.093 --> 00:00:57.559]  Planetary collapse, mass riots, mass migration, war in the streets, total crime, UN takeover of what's left.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.002]  It is all in progress now.
[00:01:02.443 --> 00:01:08.289]   And by the time the general public figures it out, It'll be too late to reverse it.
[00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:09.429]  We'll win long term.
[00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:13.990]  There's a lot of scenarios I've crawled through psychologically, mentally, spiritually.
[00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:17.911]  We will prevail.
[00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:26.831]   But the globalists were put in power by Satan to carry this out, and they're slaves, and they will execute this attempt.
[00:01:26.831 --> 00:01:36.831]  [music]
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.680]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:56.680]  [Music]
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.680]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:02:02.598 --> 00:02:10.385]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:02:10.485 --> 00:02:18.192]  There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[00:02:18.413 --> 00:02:20.515]  As president, I will make it clear.
[00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:26.137]  That the United States will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack.
[00:02:26.677 --> 00:02:32.039]  We will be ready with serious political, economic, and military responses.
[00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.380]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump.
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.461]  But if they vote for Hillary, it's war.
[00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:41.082]  We came, we saw, he died.
[00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:45.499]  With her, you'll end up in World War III.
[00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.184]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[00:02:49.524 --> 00:02:57.414]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to go to war against Syria and Russia.
[00:02:59.335 --> 00:02:59.815]  The U.S.
[00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:03.477]  military has just raised the threat level to DEFCON 2.
[00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:11.442]  Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton is still threatening Russia with military action, following unconfirmed reports of further hacking.
[00:03:11.802 --> 00:03:14.143]  It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[00:03:14.503 --> 00:03:15.924]  Of course not, because she's... Hang on, guys.
[00:03:15.944 --> 00:03:17.365]  There's a really loud noise.
[00:03:18.885 --> 00:03:22.888]  Alright, looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties.
[00:03:22.928 --> 00:03:25.149]  We'll try to get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:33.276]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[00:03:33.276 --> 00:03:35.276]  [static]
[00:03:35.276 --> 00:03:55.276]  [music]
[00:03:55.276 --> 00:03:56.276]  [buzzer]
[00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:57.776]  SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
[00:03:57.765 --> 00:03:57.905]  Inc.
[00:03:57.945 --> 00:03:59.445]  NORAD has declared DEFCON 3.
[00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.206]  Scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:04:01.746 --> 00:04:03.567]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:08.789]  The bopper spends all its time thinking about World War 3.
[00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.190]  Target selection complete.
[00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.291]  Time on target sequence complete.
[00:04:14.471 --> 00:04:17.092]  22 Typhoon class submarines departing Petropavlovsk.
[00:04:17.453 --> 00:04:18.753]  Turning southbound at North Cap.
[00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:19.713]  Bearing 095 degrees.
[00:04:19.753 --> 00:04:22.995]  Radar reports two unknown tracks circling the target.
[00:04:26.124 --> 00:04:29.226]  From the front lines of the Information War.
[00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:32.508]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode.
[00:04:32.548 --> 00:04:33.949]  We are at DEFCON 1.
[00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:38.652]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[00:04:38.732 --> 00:04:39.252]  You bet!
[00:04:39.732 --> 00:04:43.915]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:04:44.055 --> 00:04:46.997]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top, where it belongs.
[00:04:47.017 --> 00:04:49.599]  3... 2... 1... Impact!
[00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:54.381]  Shall we play a game?
[00:04:54.322 --> 00:05:00.322]  How about global thermonuclear war?
[00:05:00.322 --> 00:05:05.322]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.321]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready.
[00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:08.422]  Awaiting launch codes.
[00:05:08.442 --> 00:05:10.003]  We are at a launch mode.
[00:05:10.104 --> 00:05:14.487]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[00:05:14.707 --> 00:05:18.670]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.511]  We're in!
[00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:21.993]  The Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[00:05:22.353 --> 00:05:24.294]  We have a Soviet submarine launch detection.
[00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.536]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[00:05:26.977 --> 00:05:28.418]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[00:05:28.898 --> 00:05:35.898]  The only winning is not today.
[00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:42.898]  [Applause]
[00:05:43.898 --> 00:05:51.898]  [Music]
[00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:53.090]  It's all come out.
[00:05:53.691 --> 00:06:00.136]  And they're doing that not because we're weak, but because we're made in the image of God, the Creator, and we are powerful.
[00:06:00.456 --> 00:06:02.958]  And the social engineers fear that so much.
[00:06:03.679 --> 00:06:09.464]  So that's why I repeat that famous internet saying that nobody knows who first came up with, but boy, is it true.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.629]  The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:28.850]   They need all their propaganda and all their lies and all their evil and all their cultural death because they in the end they signed on the God of this world who is a
[00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:32.651]   loser. And that's why it's so important that everybody keep InfoWars in the air now
[00:06:32.651 --> 00:06:37.670]   more than ever. Because even if you don't believe in God, what the globalists are manifesting
[00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:39.250]  and setting up is satanic.
[00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.250]   And we are opposing the one world government and the mark of the beast they just announced.
[00:06:43.250 --> 00:07:01.250]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. InfoWars has been banned.
[00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:03.831]  (upbeat music)
[00:07:03.549 --> 00:07:03.889]  Arrested.
[00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:08.812]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:07:10.252 --> 00:07:11.913]  Because we are effective.
[00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:15.055]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:07:15.375 --> 00:07:17.036]  Go to Banned.Video.
[00:07:17.736 --> 00:07:19.877]  Download the videos and share.
[00:07:21.798 --> 00:07:31.247]   Support the Information War at InfoWarsStore.com and never give up the fight.
[00:07:31.247 --> 00:07:33.826]  (upbeat music)
[00:07:33.826 --> 00:07:41.507]  Infowars.com.
[00:07:41.507 --> 00:07:47.247]  (upbeat music)
[00:07:47.247 --> 00:07:55.408]   Next week in Geneva, Switzerland, members of the World Health Organization,
[00:07:55.408 --> 00:07:59.766]   which was founded on the principles of establishing a one world government,
[00:07:59.766 --> 00:08:06.828]   will be voting to give themselves worldwide authority when it comes to official international health emergencies.
[00:08:07.389 --> 00:08:15.777]  The same World Health Organization who praised Communist China's extreme authoritarian lockdown against the Chinese people.
[00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.633]  ...who suggested forcibly separating families to quarantine them.
[00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:30.339]  In most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household, at family level.
[00:08:31.019 --> 00:08:36.043]  In some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units.
[00:08:37.478 --> 00:08:46.981]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:49.722]  And who was caught faking the H1N1 pandemic in 2010.
[00:08:52.663 --> 00:09:06.753]  The same World Health Organization run by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who's been working with the Clinton Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation since 2007, who said that the lockdowns will never end.
[00:09:06.773 --> 00:09:12.357]  I repeat, there will be no return to the old normal for the foreseeable future.
[00:09:12.737 --> 00:09:19.363]  And that the war in Ukraine was getting massive attention as a result of bias against black lives.
[00:09:19.964 --> 00:09:20.444]  The U.S.
[00:09:20.464 --> 00:09:23.287]  government is in full support of this new U.N.
[00:09:23.387 --> 00:09:37.581]  treaty with the WHO and has submitted 13 amendments, which will be voted on next week, that will give the WHO international authority on lockdowns, forced quarantines, and forced vaccinations.
[00:09:37.961 --> 00:09:45.105]  According to constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, none of this is legally binding until a treaty is approved by the U.S.
[00:09:45.145 --> 00:09:45.425]  Senate.
[00:09:45.886 --> 00:09:51.429]  But the law hasn't been stopping these criminals from committing crimes against humanity so far.
[00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:58.233]  And if they plan on staying in power, they are going to have to bring back the lockdowns and the ballot-harvesting mules.
[00:09:58.893 --> 00:09:59.954]  So we know it's coming.
[00:10:00.374 --> 00:10:05.237]  And it will soon be climate lockdowns to go with their climate migration.
[00:10:05.857 --> 00:10:10.620]  People are waking up, but the UN's agenda is aggressively pressing forward.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:24.727]  The United Nations is meeting this week with members of the Mayor's Migration Council, which is comprised of nine mayors from nine different cities throughout the world, including Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, California.
[00:10:25.387 --> 00:10:36.133]  The Mayor's Migration Council is funded by George Soros' Open Society Foundations, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, and partnered with the United Nations.
[00:10:36.693 --> 00:10:38.874]  And their stated goal is pretty clear.
[00:10:39.294 --> 00:10:51.201]  They want to grant mayors the ability to bypass state and federal government when it comes to what they call climate migration, and go straight to international organizations for resources.
[00:10:51.861 --> 00:11:09.024]  They are inviting all interested mayors or senior city staff members to contact them at contact at mayorsmigrationcouncil.org to learn how to engage with the international system and learn how to get funding and boots on the ground support.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.965]  This all sounds completely illegal, but who's going to stop them?
[00:11:14.485 --> 00:11:25.379]  There is no longer any justice in America, so expect more lockdowns as the food supply diminishes and the population around you surges with hungry foreign migrants.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:33.760]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:40.760]  [Music]
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:48.160]   350 million or more people in Africa and then 12 die of Ebola in one little town.
[00:11:48.192 --> 00:11:49.293]  They go, Oh, Ebola!
[00:11:49.594 --> 00:11:50.274]  Ebola!
[00:11:50.535 --> 00:11:51.215]  Ebola!
[00:11:51.315 --> 00:11:52.156]  Oh, Ebola!
[00:11:52.316 --> 00:11:59.224]  And they had Syrian people saying, saying, diseases will be coming out of the rainforest because Mother Earth is mad!
[00:11:59.564 --> 00:12:02.027]  Literally like witch doctors going, Booga booga!
[00:12:02.067 --> 00:12:02.868]  Some not come back!
[00:12:03.408 --> 00:12:06.530]  You know, when we have floods and rain and meteors might hit the Earth.
[00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:08.731]  What if a meteor hits the Earth tomorrow and destroys a city?
[00:12:08.751 --> 00:12:11.432]  Are they gonna say this is because the people of Earth have been bad?
[00:12:11.452 --> 00:12:13.293]  That meteor just came from space?
[00:12:13.513 --> 00:12:15.595]  It's a very primitive control apparatus.
[00:12:15.915 --> 00:12:19.797]  It's how chiefs and medicine doctors use to control and shaman would control the people.
[00:12:20.077 --> 00:12:21.938]  Saying, oh, if you're not good the crops won't come.
[00:12:22.258 --> 00:12:23.859]  Oh, the environment, if we're not good.
[00:12:24.319 --> 00:12:28.262]  I don't want to eat a piece of meat that's got dioxins in it from plastics production.
[00:12:28.662 --> 00:12:37.369]  I don't want them dumping nickel cadmium and heavy metal grignard reagents in the waters so my kids are deformed.
[00:12:37.429 --> 00:12:38.049]  I don't want that.
[00:12:38.109 --> 00:12:38.950]  I'm for the environment.
[00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:51.319]   But these international corrupt people financing global population control, which is just nothing more but dictators' excuses to kill men, women, and children, and girls in slave labor camps in China making Nikes, You call that good?
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:13:00.608]  And all these Hollywood people that say they love you are the ones that speak out against slave labor, are the ones you find out later, are the ones that own all the sweatshops making their clothes lines?
[00:13:00.968 --> 00:13:02.129]  They're all hypocrites!
[00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.971]  They're all hypocrites using you!
[00:13:05.932 --> 00:13:08.615]  So here it is, Global Plan to Fight Infectious Diseases Sought.
[00:13:08.655 --> 00:13:22.083]   I haven't read this yet, but... Washington, a new plan to coordinate International efforts to track and combat infectious diseases will be announcing by the leaders of the G7 Group of Industrial Nations at this weekend's summit in Denver.
[00:13:22.384 --> 00:13:24.305]  White House aides said Monday!
[00:13:24.846 --> 00:13:28.309]  And the combustion engine is the greatest threat to civilization!
[00:13:28.549 --> 00:13:30.151]  Like Al Gore says in Earth and the Balance.
[00:13:30.571 --> 00:13:31.692]  No, Mr. Gore!
[00:13:31.912 --> 00:13:35.175]  The combustion engine is civilization!
[00:13:35.195 --> 00:13:37.858]  And the combustion engine's getting cleaned up!
[00:13:38.298 --> 00:13:41.361]  Because we're putting catalytic converters on the cars!
[00:13:41.662 --> 00:13:46.787]  Just like we got the horses out of the streets a hundred years ago, and we don't have a horse manure problem anymore!
[00:13:46.807 --> 00:13:48.548]  Humans move forward!
[00:13:48.849 --> 00:13:50.690]  I know the bureaucrats don't want that.
[00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:52.652]  You want us to stay down and lowly.
[00:13:52.631 --> 00:13:55.191]  You don't want us to transcend, do you?
[00:13:55.191 --> 00:14:01.191]  [Music]
[00:14:01.191 --> 00:14:05.191]   The majority of the elite are leaning towards, this is a public declaration,
[00:14:05.191 --> 00:14:09.190]  towards the orderly extermination of the mass.
[00:14:09.572 --> 00:14:19.798]  They're not going to just have big robotic factories making brain pods, you know, iPods that go, that plug right into your head, or right through the neural network, right through your eyes.
[00:14:20.238 --> 00:14:23.480]  They're not going to get, you're not going to have that, you're not going to get that.
[00:14:24.355 --> 00:14:30.261]  You're not going to get life extension technologies when they're six and a half billion, going to be eight billion by the time they've really got that shirt up.
[00:14:30.561 --> 00:14:33.480]  (electronic music)
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:46.821]  The elite.
[00:14:46.821 --> 00:14:54.381]   I understand, Rourke, you heard about free supply, you heard about mechanized robotic factories so advanced
[00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:57.381]  that you will be able to lay a rat on your hind end all day.
[00:14:57.381 --> 00:15:07.381]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:14:58.758 --> 00:15:03.261]  And that is actually coming in the manufacturing industrial singularity.
[00:15:04.182 --> 00:15:05.463]  There will be many singularities.
[00:15:06.283 --> 00:15:08.885]  Different steps towards the true singularity.
[00:15:09.798 --> 00:15:11.099]  Which is a mathematical fact.
[00:15:11.499 --> 00:15:14.681]  And you better not want the singularity because it means the end of the species.
[00:15:15.001 --> 00:15:16.462]  And it means not even being able to grasp.
[00:15:16.882 --> 00:15:23.566]  You know there aren't, there is no one on the earth who can grasp all the computer technological systems and how they interface and how they run.
[00:15:23.847 --> 00:15:59.847]   And what's happened is humans and human technicians and computer scientists man and oversee with an organic augmentation the computing systems and the Artificial neural networks that have been created and they oversee their different sciences and then attempt to merge those together and are building computer systems that compute and integrate and design other computers and it's basically already, with the technology we know about, not just the suppressed technology, but the technology that we know about, basically already out of human hands.
[00:15:59.947 --> 00:16:08.417]   We might, if we had a full conscience movement towards full disclosure and investigation, And control, be able to slow this down.
[00:16:09.858 --> 00:16:12.780]  You know, in the past, it took a hundred years for major developments to happen.
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:14.281]  Now it's happening every six months.
[00:16:16.483 --> 00:16:31.453]  And so, yes, the elite made the decision as early as I can tell, about 80 years ago, that manufacturing in the future, and they even successfully predicted when that would be, turned to the new century.
[00:16:34.688 --> 00:16:48.675]  Here I am in the year 2002 laying out what we are now living.
[00:16:50.316 --> 00:16:57.880]  Open world government has now been announced and it's endgame is complete and total shutdown of civilization as we know it in mass death.
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.282]  Prepare yourselves and resist with everything you've got.
[00:17:04.687 --> 00:17:16.486]  Be as wise as serpents and peaceful as doves, but fight like your life depends on it in the information war peacefully to warn the world that if you think things are bad now, they're about to get a thousand times worse.
[00:17:17.253 --> 00:17:18.693]  The facts and common sense are in.
[00:17:18.854 --> 00:17:20.494]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires.
[00:17:20.634 --> 00:17:21.734]  Yes, they manipulate.
[00:17:21.874 --> 00:17:23.555]  Yes, there are secret societies.
[00:17:23.895 --> 00:17:25.996]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history.
[00:17:26.316 --> 00:17:43.041]  And yes, today, in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[00:17:44.042 --> 00:17:46.765]  We're human beings are absolutely worthless.
[00:17:47.345 --> 00:17:56.294]  There's six and a quarter plus billion of us, and the globalists have said it many times, there's too many of us, we're causing a problem, we need to be cold at the tune of 80%.
[00:17:56.435 --> 00:18:12.024]   It's amazing to talk about that, but it's the globalists, the UN, their own public statements, and they've convinced a lot of Liberals and elitist conservatives and others, that by going along with this, that we're intelligent members of society.
[00:18:12.765 --> 00:18:15.946]  It's the ultimate Malthus worldview.
[00:18:16.146 --> 00:18:23.328]  It is this radical, virulent form of social Darwinism.
[00:18:23.428 --> 00:18:26.149]  It's the excuse of tyrants.
[00:18:27.256 --> 00:18:41.005]  And by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources, by centralizing and socializing health care, the state becomes God, basically, when it comes to your health.
[00:18:41.164 --> 00:18:47.164]   and then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us, we then basically get
[00:18:47.164 --> 00:18:48.164]  shoved into their system.
[00:18:48.164 --> 00:18:54.404]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:54.903 --> 00:19:00.485]  I normally play new breaking news and promos at the start of the show because I think that's some of the most important information we have.
[00:19:00.525 --> 00:19:01.625]  Gregory's reports and others.
[00:19:02.686 --> 00:19:04.586]  But today I got in here about an hour before.
[00:19:04.606 --> 00:19:09.327]  I've been getting ready for hours at home and I was going over all the news and getting ready for what I was going to cover.
[00:19:09.767 --> 00:19:19.170]  The whole world government announcement and what the end game of that world government is publicly and the key word global Marshall Plan, which I've warned you would be when they make their main move.
[00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.871]  We have Prince Charles saying this is a military action.
[00:19:22.751 --> 00:19:27.354]  We're going to spend more money than exists in the whole world to end carbon as we know it.
[00:19:27.394 --> 00:19:28.655]  We're a carbon-based life form.
[00:19:28.695 --> 00:19:32.078]  In fact, I forgot to tell you guys to get that again from six months ago or five months ago.
[00:19:32.998 --> 00:19:42.385]  Prince Charles says that we need to make it a global military campaign to decarbonize when life is carbon-based on this planet.
[00:19:42.745 --> 00:19:43.766]  He's made new announcements.
[00:19:43.786 --> 00:19:44.566]  We've got all those.
[00:19:44.626 --> 00:19:45.707]  It's just insane.
[00:19:46.388 --> 00:19:48.909]  We are now living in what we warned about for so long.
[00:19:49.778 --> 00:19:59.145]  But I had to run a rebroadcast and play some important old reports and things and some new reports because I don't choke when it comes to stress or being under attack.
[00:20:00.126 --> 00:20:11.014]  But right before the show, about 20 minutes before, a bunch of big developments happened, all of them good, that I just can't even get out of my mind right now.
[00:20:11.575 --> 00:20:14.157]  But I cannot release the information at this point.
[00:20:16.218 --> 00:20:19.920]   And so We have a very special guest.
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:24.585]  Federal court just ruled that they could not shut down his church and that it was unconstitutional during the lockdowns.
[00:20:24.605 --> 00:20:27.969]  That pastor is going to be joining us in the second hour and I will be here for that.
[00:20:28.009 --> 00:20:28.950]  That is a big deal.
[00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.472]  Of course, we knew that had to happen.
[00:20:30.532 --> 00:20:32.574]  We saw any semblance of freedom.
[00:20:32.955 --> 00:20:38.461]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:20:39.062 --> 00:20:42.726]  Then it goes on to the right of the press, the right to assemble, and the regressive grievances.
[00:20:43.407 --> 00:20:43.567]  L.A.
[00:20:43.607 --> 00:20:50.694]  pandemic restrictions, Louisiana pandemic restrictions, violated religious rights, court rules, Pastor Tony Spell takes a victory lap.
[00:20:50.955 --> 00:20:52.636]  That's NBC News.
[00:20:53.357 --> 00:20:54.638]  But it's not gotten a lot of attention.
[00:20:54.679 --> 00:20:55.499]  That's local news.
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.642]  He's joining us, and we've got so much more to hit.
[00:20:58.483 --> 00:21:07.933]   And I'm really prepared here today, too, but I We may just have to call Owen and get him in here, because I don't know if I can do the show.
[00:21:08.273 --> 00:21:23.036]  So the stuff going on is that big, and I need to process this, and I need to... Man, I tell you, I mean... I'm not going to get to it yet.
[00:21:23.135 --> 00:21:28.894]   I can't half-ass this and I've got to go sit in my office for 10-15 minutes and cogitate
[00:21:28.894 --> 00:21:32.894]  on this because I just...
[00:21:32.894 --> 00:21:33.894]  Man.
[00:21:33.894 --> 00:21:40.296]   There's a lot of good news and a lot of really bad news as well.
[00:21:41.268 --> 00:21:49.439]  And I was already going to come in here and cover the bad news so we can get positioned to deal with it and be in a fighting stance.
[00:21:50.541 --> 00:21:53.585]  And then this other information came in and it's just unbelievable.
[00:21:55.034 --> 00:21:55.855]  But it's on.
[00:21:56.095 --> 00:21:57.596]  The fight between good and evil is here.
[00:21:58.557 --> 00:22:02.319]  And a lot of people in the power structure have decided to not join with the New World Order.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:04.441]  Now they see just how damn evil it is.
[00:22:04.461 --> 00:22:09.945]  Because we're now down to the point of literally cutting off the food, the water, not just the baby formula, the electricity.
[00:22:11.566 --> 00:22:13.908]  That's how they're going to win their fight against us is shut everything down.
[00:22:14.288 --> 00:22:16.429]  And what I'm saying is life and death.
[00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:19.031]  So please, just take a moment.
[00:22:19.111 --> 00:22:20.672]  Imagine you can hear a pin drop.
[00:22:21.453 --> 00:22:31.780]   Because I want what I'm about to say to really get home, okay?
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:37.780]   If the globalists think they can get away with their operation, they're going to do it.
[00:22:37.834 --> 00:22:43.779]  And they've already done a stress test in the last two years with the COVID lockdowns as a beta test for the next big move.
[00:22:44.419 --> 00:22:52.866]  Planetary collapse, mass riots, mass migration, war in the streets, total crime, UN takeover of what's left.
[00:22:53.146 --> 00:22:56.309]  It is all in progress now.
[00:22:57.770 --> 00:23:02.673]   And by the time the general public figures it out, It'll be too late to reverse it.
[00:23:03.374 --> 00:23:04.695]  We'll win long term.
[00:23:04.735 --> 00:23:09.299]  There's a lot of scenarios I've crawled through psychologically, mentally, spiritually.
[00:23:12.382 --> 00:23:13.243]  We will prevail.
[00:23:15.365 --> 00:23:22.071]  But the globalists were put in power by Satan to carry this out, and they're slaves, and they will execute this attempt.
[00:23:23.212 --> 00:23:27.405]   And so That's where we are right now.
[00:23:27.845 --> 00:23:32.627]  And to say I'm speechless is basically what we're at.
[00:23:32.887 --> 00:23:35.528]  I need to compartmentalize the information I'm not ready to release yet.
[00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:37.269]  And I normally can do that.
[00:23:37.449 --> 00:23:39.389]  I'm trying to right now, but it's the front of my mind.
[00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.630]  And then I need to just judiciously cover this news.
[00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:53.514]  I'm going to do the show, but I've got to really go sit down for at least two minutes by myself and just really get some focus here.
[00:23:56.716 --> 00:23:59.997]  Man, it's unbelievable.
[00:24:01.178 --> 00:24:02.398]  Everything is so unbelievable now.
[00:24:03.679 --> 00:24:06.540]  And I just can't believe so many people don't know what they've signed on to.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.660]  I mean, God help us.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.260]  And I mean that.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.621]  God, please help us.
[00:24:10.241 --> 00:24:14.583]  I think we all just need to pray for justice and pray for an awakening and pray to come together and have love.
[00:24:15.703 --> 00:24:18.084]  And none of us are perfect, but God can perfect us.
[00:24:19.046 --> 00:24:42.865]   And with through God we are perfected and I just pray that God send the Holy Spirit to me and everybody else to be stronger than ever so that we can try to avert this because I have an extreme feeling of responsibility knowing all this try to stop it I know you do as well and I I mean, there'll be a billion dead people in two years under this plan, conservatively.
[00:24:42.885 --> 00:24:46.247]  Can you imagine what that's going to look like?
[00:24:46.347 --> 00:24:48.629]  What that's going to entail?
[00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:50.910]  And of course, this is all real.
[00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:52.131]  You see it now, it's all happening.
[00:24:52.151 --> 00:25:01.078]  But I mean, it really needs to sink in that they are running an operation to kill us.
[00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:03.439]  And that they enjoy it.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.340]  And they like it.
[00:25:05.401 --> 00:25:06.261]  And we've got to stop them.
[00:25:07.042 --> 00:25:08.363]  I mean, we're not going to let them kill everybody.
[00:25:09.195 --> 00:25:09.775]  We gotta do it!
[00:25:11.076 --> 00:25:12.756]  Alright, get right with God, folks.
[00:25:13.516 --> 00:25:15.897]  I'm gonna try to get focused and just come back and cover the news.
[00:25:16.457 --> 00:25:17.358]  We'll see if I can do it.
[00:25:17.378 --> 00:25:17.798]  Stay with us.
[00:25:18.658 --> 00:25:26.681]  We have got to warn the people that criminals have hijacked our government and are waging war against the nation to bring us to our knees financially.
[00:25:28.661 --> 00:25:29.641]  We have to stop them.
[00:25:30.502 --> 00:25:31.002]  We have to.
[00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.792]  Demand the Republicans move for impeachment immediately.
[00:25:35.472 --> 00:25:40.376]  Even though they don't have all the votes, it will expose the Democratic Party and what they're doing and who they are controlled by.
[00:25:40.396 --> 00:25:43.678]  And it will expose Republicans that are in league with them.
[00:25:43.718 --> 00:25:44.359]  It must be done.
[00:25:45.079 --> 00:25:47.041]  That's just one of the default settings.
[00:25:47.801 --> 00:25:54.406]  If you're in a factory and something blows up and a guy's on fire, you grab a fire extinguisher and put him out.
[00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:56.828]  That's just the fire extinguisher.
[00:25:58.049 --> 00:26:00.611]  We've got to continue to educate people as fast as we can.
[00:26:01.111 --> 00:26:06.075]  We are really entering an incredibly explosive moment where the globalist propaganda has totally failed.
[00:26:06.596 --> 00:26:11.399]  Everybody's turning against them, but they still have the centralized power and are accelerating their program.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.661]  And it is just super dangerous.
[00:26:15.343 --> 00:26:16.784]  And I've got the stacks right here.
[00:26:17.995 --> 00:26:20.096]  It's on Infowars.com, Zero Hedge article.
[00:26:20.516 --> 00:26:23.898]  Biden administration anticipating wave of summer violence over Roe v. Wade.
[00:26:24.238 --> 00:26:25.639]  They're the ones that are going to be violent.
[00:26:25.979 --> 00:26:28.580]  I told you going into the midterms they were going to pull this.
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.781]  And it's like clockwork happening.
[00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:32.639]  So we've got that.
[00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:34.720]  And then we've got reports like this.
[00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.460]  I mean, it's just, all of these are so insane.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:56.566]  Gas stations, this is Daily Mail, in Washington reprogrammed pumps, this is on record, to prepare for, wait for it, gas stations in Washington reprogrammed pumps to prepare for $10 a gallon fuel as Bidenflation sends average price soaring $4.57 almost twice the $2.41 during Trump's final month.
[00:26:59.387 --> 00:27:01.768]  And again, what's the lie in that headline?
[00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:12.862]  As much as it's fun to make fun of Biden, the joke's on us, he's a placeholder for the globalists and Obama so that he gets the blame when this all goes down.
[00:27:12.902 --> 00:27:17.203]  Because if they get the blame, they will have to stop their lockdowns, which they've done for now.
[00:27:17.443 --> 00:27:18.984]  They'll have to stop all this inflation.
[00:27:19.064 --> 00:27:21.685]  It's all artificial economic warfare.
[00:27:24.626 --> 00:27:28.987]  So it's not like I'm here just saying, oh, you need to get angry and call Congress and call talk radio.
[00:27:29.247 --> 00:27:32.168]  You better do it or they will bankrupt you to control you.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:41.662]  And the next phases of this thing are way worse than it is now, and that's why I'm so desperate to try to mitigate this before it gets too bad.
[00:27:43.322 --> 00:27:48.543]  Mark my words, everybody serving the system that thinks they're on the winning team are fools.
[00:27:50.364 --> 00:27:55.885]  This is going to destroy the globalists in the process of destroying us.
[00:27:57.864 --> 00:28:06.812]  I've got a stack of news all over the world where the Pfizer, Moderna and J&J shots were given with children's livers liquefying, many of them dying.
[00:28:07.293 --> 00:28:12.577]  And it's specifically known that the J&J is the one that does it the worst, but they all create the same spike protein.
[00:28:13.618 --> 00:28:15.340]  And I've had medical doctors on to lay that out.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.962]  These people are so damn sick.
[00:28:18.945 --> 00:28:22.188]  Record miscarriages, record babies being born stillborn.
[00:28:22.828 --> 00:28:26.191]  They're not just aborting our children before they're born.
[00:28:26.571 --> 00:28:27.732]  They're aborting all of us.
[00:28:28.372 --> 00:28:29.694]  That's what the New World Order is.
[00:28:30.134 --> 00:28:31.215]  I've got a bunch of these clips.
[00:28:32.055 --> 00:28:39.101]  Here is Congress yesterday in a Biden administration abortion testimony with a Biden administration official.
[00:28:41.163 --> 00:28:42.424]  And they say, what is a man?
[00:28:43.124 --> 00:28:44.085]  Can a man have a baby?
[00:28:44.105 --> 00:28:45.266]  And I go, yeah, a man can have a baby.
[00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.371]  This is the people that say they're all about science.
[00:28:48.951 --> 00:28:57.393]  Bill Nye, the science guy a few years ago, went back and re-edited his 1980s and 90s TV shows where they had shows about X and Y chromosomes in male and female.
[00:28:57.953 --> 00:29:00.974]  And they went and took that out and said, oh no, everybody's male and female.
[00:29:02.234 --> 00:29:14.578]  And there's new big studies out where many frog populations have completely died and become extincted because of atrazine alone making the frogs all, quote, feminine.
[00:29:16.134 --> 00:29:19.477]  It's just the endgame.
[00:29:19.637 --> 00:29:30.686]  We are entering the endgame, their blueprint for global enslavement and extermination, and it's just incredible.
[00:29:30.806 --> 00:29:46.018]   I mean, it's moving faster and faster and faster and faster, and you see the delusional people that either don't want to know what's going on, or are part of it, pretending like they're going to win, and they're all going to be consumed In the flames of tyranny.
[00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:59.381]  If I thought violence would help, we've certainly passed the point of the Declaration of Independence, our right, our duty, to throw off the bonds of tyranny and to remake a new government.
[00:30:00.342 --> 00:30:10.664]  But the way they've set up the brainwashing and the control, any violence, even against globalists themselves, will just give them more power and control because it's an evil system that's thousands of deep.
[00:30:11.687 --> 00:30:14.248]  It's like a football coach saying, you gotta take out that wide receiver.
[00:30:14.268 --> 00:30:15.368]  He just scored two touchdowns.
[00:30:15.708 --> 00:30:17.489]  I don't care if you get thrown out of the game.
[00:30:17.729 --> 00:30:19.450]  I want you to spear him in the kidneys.
[00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:25.151]  What if they had a thousand more wide receivers just as good as that guy or better?
[00:30:26.872 --> 00:30:32.854]  Well then, you can't send in your linebacker to break their ribs.
[00:30:34.807 --> 00:30:36.048]  This is not traditional war.
[00:30:36.869 --> 00:30:39.251]  So violence isn't just not the answer.
[00:30:39.831 --> 00:30:42.674]  Violence is absolutely what we don't want.
[00:30:43.354 --> 00:30:46.917]  I've been criticized by some for saying there shouldn't have been violence at the Capitol that day.
[00:30:46.978 --> 00:30:47.778]  Sure, it's overblown.
[00:30:48.038 --> 00:30:49.239]  Most people are totally innocent.
[00:30:49.580 --> 00:30:51.562]  Others are in solitary confinement, should have already been out of jail.
[00:30:51.582 --> 00:30:56.406]  Kamala Harris is bailing out people that, you know, burned down federal buildings and firebombed things.
[00:30:59.053 --> 00:31:02.916]  But I get criticized by callers saying, hey, you should have helped storm it that day.
[00:31:02.976 --> 00:31:03.916]  We could have taken the government.
[00:31:04.157 --> 00:31:05.798]  That capital's not the government.
[00:31:06.818 --> 00:31:09.220]  The military government is in Cheyenne Mountain.
[00:31:10.321 --> 00:31:11.282]  And Colorado Springs.
[00:31:12.382 --> 00:31:16.185]  And Site R. And that's not even the government.
[00:31:16.225 --> 00:31:18.066]  The government is the global corporations.
[00:31:19.267 --> 00:31:22.970]  And so, it's not a cowardice issue that I don't want violence.
[00:31:24.361 --> 00:31:30.104]  Blowing up a federal building does nothing but turn the instrument of the globalist into a victim, the last thing we want.
[00:31:32.005 --> 00:31:46.373]  So I tell you now, there will come points if we don't stop this where they're coming to take you to FEMA camps under the guise of viruses, and you will know that at that point it's a decision you've got to make between you and God and your family.
[00:31:48.474 --> 00:32:00.396]   But before we get to that point, you need to make the decision That you're going to speak out and stand up and engage in civil disobedience in a legal and lawful way.
[00:32:00.416 --> 00:32:14.724]  The Pentagon has a report they put out in the 60s, I think it's titled 198 or 199 Ways to Peacefully Resist Civil Disobedience.
[00:32:15.324 --> 00:32:16.625]  And I've read the report on there before.
[00:32:18.232 --> 00:32:25.077]  And it's a report you should really go read, because you'll see we've put most of that into action here, but we can't do all of it.
[00:32:25.377 --> 00:32:26.678]  You're going to have to put it into action.
[00:32:27.819 --> 00:32:46.253]  And you're going to have to decide whether you want to be a soldier of truth and justice to peacefully resist this, or whether you want to try to go hide and wait it out, or, as if you could ride it out, or whether or not you want to take the right course, and that is total political action, prayer, and civil action.
[00:32:47.435 --> 00:32:48.276]  There it is.
[00:32:48.476 --> 00:32:50.057]  198 Methods of Nonviolent Action.
[00:32:51.278 --> 00:32:52.018]  Now go read it.
[00:32:52.038 --> 00:32:56.261]  In fact, I'm going to post it in full under the live show feed today.
[00:32:56.301 --> 00:33:00.444]  Ben, our great writer and researcher in there, posts the whole thing.
[00:33:00.464 --> 00:33:06.389]  Not just the link, but he can post the text under the live show feed today.
[00:33:06.409 --> 00:33:12.174]   We can put the live show feed on air so I give folks the Headline of the day, so that everybody can share it.
[00:33:12.254 --> 00:33:13.455]  Emergency broadcast.
[00:33:14.096 --> 00:33:20.280]  The UN Davos Group have openly announced a planetary technocracy-based dictatorship.
[00:33:22.321 --> 00:33:22.921]  As U.S.
[00:33:23.021 --> 00:33:27.104]  is engulfed by record inflation, collapsing border, and a proxy war with Russia.
[00:33:28.825 --> 00:33:37.371]  And the globalists do intend to have this go from a proxy war to a full war with Russia as their great reset, their build back better, you'll have nothing, you'll own nothing, you'll like it.
[00:33:38.846 --> 00:33:41.668]  I got a bunch of abortion clips that we'll get to when we come back.
[00:33:42.148 --> 00:33:45.269]  Then we have a special guest on the First Amendment, this pastor in this big federal win.
[00:33:45.810 --> 00:34:00.687]   And then in the third hour, I'm going to cover The UN Treaty and the world finally waking up to it and now they're leaking what's in it, they're writing it in secret, and they're making public announcements that the Davos Group is in command of the UN, so the corporate technocrats are now in full command of this takeover.
[00:34:01.087 --> 00:34:19.919]   That is all coming up as well today, and I beg you, for the sake of your children, your grandchildren, your neighbors, your friends, and your own life, to realize This audience is the tip of the spear, and you have initiated the chain reaction already.
[00:34:20.599 --> 00:34:31.781]  We've got a fighting chance, but sharing InfoWars.com forward slash show, or telling everybody you know about that local radio station, or TV station, or cable station that picks us up, is so critical.
[00:34:31.861 --> 00:34:37.063]  Sharing the articles and videos from Man.Video is so critical, and buying products at InfoWars.com.
[00:34:37.103 --> 00:34:43.944]  And we've had a lot of big support, and a lot of big donations that have really helped us, and we want to thank all of you that have done that, and you know who you are.
[00:34:48.594 --> 00:34:49.675]  What do you say a woman is?
[00:34:51.696 --> 00:34:54.258]  I believe that everyone can identify for themselves.
[00:34:57.821 --> 00:35:01.163]  Do you believe then that men can become pregnant and have abortions?
[00:35:02.845 --> 00:35:03.845]  Yes.
[00:35:03.845 --> 00:35:13.684]   Well, that's the Biden administration official over abortion.
[00:35:13.684 --> 00:35:15.764]  (laughs)
[00:35:16.323 --> 00:35:23.665]  Let's play this clip of the New York mayor doubles down on abortion up to the time children are born.
[00:35:23.705 --> 00:35:26.185]  A woman should determine what they're going to do with their bodies.
[00:35:26.725 --> 00:35:29.346]  And so a baby coming out of the womb nine months old is her body.
[00:35:29.406 --> 00:35:29.706]  Kill it.
[00:35:30.666 --> 00:35:32.427]  Overwhelming number of people on the Supreme Court.
[00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:34.427]  I don't believe they can deliver a baby.
[00:35:35.827 --> 00:35:36.327]  Oh, that's right.
[00:35:36.367 --> 00:35:37.208]  It's the medical system.
[00:35:37.248 --> 00:35:38.428]  It's their decision what to do.
[00:35:39.728 --> 00:35:43.429]  And now they have got bills introduced all over the country to kill babies after they're born for weeks after.
[00:35:44.692 --> 00:35:46.692]  Here are these monsters.
[00:35:46.692 --> 00:35:51.641]   ...debate in this country. You've been an ardent supporter of abortion rights, and I want to play an exchange where
[00:35:51.641 --> 00:35:53.592]  you talked about this. Let's listen.
[00:35:53.592 --> 00:35:58.092]   "Mayor Adams, do you think there should be any limitation on abortion?"
[00:35:58.092 --> 00:36:00.692]  "No, I do not."
[00:36:00.692 --> 00:36:02.692]  "None? Day of birth? Totally fine?"
[00:36:02.692 --> 00:36:06.952]   "No, I do not think. I think women should have a right to choose their bodies.
[00:36:06.952 --> 00:36:10.751]   Men should not have that right to choose how women should treat their bodies."
[00:36:10.751 --> 00:36:12.751]  That is interesting.
[00:36:12.775 --> 00:36:27.551]  A poll that just came out this morning, NPR Marist, says the vast majority of Americans do not support overturning Roe vs. Wade, but a majority, including a majority of Democrats, does believe that there could or should be some restrictions in when during a pregnancy that could be.
[00:36:27.591 --> 00:36:29.573]  You say no restrictions at all.
[00:36:31.374 --> 00:36:37.198]  No, I say, and I continue to say, and I stand by this, women should determine what they're going to do with their bodies.
[00:36:38.258 --> 00:36:43.642]  I just believe it's unbelievable that men are making these determinations.
[00:36:44.202 --> 00:36:45.323]  Women should determine.
[00:36:45.363 --> 00:36:49.726]  The overwhelming number of people on the Supreme Court, I don't believe they can deliver a baby.
[00:36:50.546 --> 00:36:53.947]  So, women should determine what they're going to do with their bodies.
[00:36:54.067 --> 00:36:55.047]  I strongly believe that.
[00:36:55.147 --> 00:36:58.028]  And I'm not taking a Gallup poll to make that determination.
[00:36:58.328 --> 00:37:10.252]  It is something I believe from seeing the women who are in my life, my mother that passed away, my two sisters and others, they should make the determination of what they're going to do with their bodies.
[00:37:11.218 --> 00:37:13.239]  Mayor Eric Adams, I do appreciate your time this morning.
[00:37:13.259 --> 00:37:14.200]  Thanks so much for being with us.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:23.066]  They're talking about babies that are already born, ladies and gentlemen, and they do it with a straight face and then say it's unbelievable that we don't want to kill them.
[00:37:23.086 --> 00:37:24.367]  And they say, well, nobody wants these babies.
[00:37:24.407 --> 00:37:28.410]  But, you know, statistically, there are more people wanting to adopt each year than there are even abortions.
[00:37:29.651 --> 00:37:34.715]  There's Congressman Chip Roy grilling some of these people in yesterday's hearings, and they were just floundering everywhere.
[00:37:34.735 --> 00:37:39.218]  They can't answer any questions because they're at war with science, with logic, and with God.
[00:37:40.075 --> 00:37:48.818]  In light of that, and in light of Texas being an inhospitable place, according to your testimony, are you aware of how many people have moved to the state of Texas in the last decade?
[00:37:50.298 --> 00:37:51.179]  Do you know what that number is?
[00:37:51.199 --> 00:37:53.259]  I don't know.
[00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.940]  I will say that the clinics that you're referring to are fake.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.581]  Four million.
[00:37:57.661 --> 00:38:00.782]  Four million people have moved to the state of Texas in the last decade.
[00:38:01.042 --> 00:38:03.723]  That's the population of the entire state of Alabama.
[00:38:04.665 --> 00:38:06.527]  I didn't ask you a question about that.
[00:38:06.607 --> 00:38:06.767]  Ms.
[00:38:06.947 --> 00:38:10.191]  Robinson, I would ask you a question.
[00:38:10.091 --> 00:38:17.091]   one other question here. Ms. Robinson, I didn't ask you a question about that. Ms. Robinson,
[00:38:17.091 --> 00:38:22.831]   I would ask you a question. When is the latest that you have performed an abortion in terms
[00:38:22.831 --> 00:38:29.831]   of weeks of the unborn child? Yes, my name is Dr. Robinson and I provide abortion care
[00:38:29.831 --> 00:38:34.630]  in Alabama.
[00:38:35.006 --> 00:38:37.287]  So Alabama has... What is the answer to the question?
[00:38:37.307 --> 00:38:39.088]  The latest that you have performed an abortion?
[00:38:39.408 --> 00:38:40.809]  I'm going to answer your question.
[00:38:41.409 --> 00:38:52.295]  So unfortunately, my state is one of those states that has passed restrictions or bans on abortion care, which limits physicians like myself... In other words, you'd like to do it later.
[00:38:52.495 --> 00:38:54.296]  What is the latest you have performed an abortion?
[00:38:54.926 --> 00:39:01.669]  So since I will always follow the law and I live in the state of Alabama, I provide abortion care up until 20 weeks gestational age.
[00:39:01.729 --> 00:39:03.650]  Okay, so you performed an abortion at 20 weeks.
[00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:04.350]  Yes, sir.
[00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:10.692]  And the procedure for an abortion, when we're talking about at 20 weeks, as I understand it, is dilation and extraction.
[00:39:13.954 --> 00:39:15.234]  That's a baby.
[00:39:17.155 --> 00:39:25.438]   Now let's shift gears into how these people that have served Satan and that are going against common sense and God's law and just Natural law.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.061]  Fall over themselves.
[00:39:30.262 --> 00:40:02.284]   Take George W. Bush, who launched illegal wars all around the world, whose sanctions killed millions of people, who lied about WMDs, who helped open our borders, who helped sign us onto the New World Order, and he has a Freudian slip and talks about the horrible evil murderers That, not blaming the troops, but that commanded that lie and that fraud of the second Iraq war, 2003, that cost us over five trillion dollars.
[00:40:02.925 --> 00:40:04.166]  That went on for over a decade.
[00:40:05.607 --> 00:40:07.428]  And it killed so many of our great troops and others.
[00:40:08.469 --> 00:40:09.230]  And wounded so many.
[00:40:10.511 --> 00:40:17.096]  And here he is, talking about himself, out of the mouths of babes.
[00:40:18.677 --> 00:40:36.591]   Here's a guy, admittedly on a bunch of psychotropic drugs, Talking about himself while he tries to talk about Vladimir Putin, when even the Pope admits the West went and overthrew the elected government eight years ago in Ukraine, started the war, attacked the Russian borders to get them to invade, they wanted that, they admit that.
[00:40:37.552 --> 00:40:40.354]  Does that mean pooty-poot, as Bush called him, is perfect?
[00:40:40.414 --> 00:40:40.634]  No.
[00:40:40.975 --> 00:40:50.323]  But the person that starts the fight, under common law, under natural law, is the person that gets the main blame.
[00:40:52.597 --> 00:40:53.799]  Am I glad Putin invaded?
[00:40:53.879 --> 00:40:54.060]  No.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.663]  I said it was a mistake and it was a trap.
[00:40:55.903 --> 00:40:57.246]  And Putin's finding that out right now.
[00:40:58.648 --> 00:41:01.293]  But regardless, they're the ones under attack.
[00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:03.041]  Not us.
[00:41:03.942 --> 00:41:04.582]  From the Russians.
[00:41:05.443 --> 00:41:15.808]  But we're under attack by the very same Soros criminal combine setting up a world government right now to take over all your medical freedom and run the CDC and cut off your fossil fuels.
[00:41:15.828 --> 00:41:16.769]  They've announced the plan.
[00:41:17.389 --> 00:41:18.409]  They're accelerating it.
[00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.391]  They're not going to get rid of fossil fuels by 2040.
[00:41:21.731 --> 00:41:22.872]  Now it's 2030.
[00:41:24.273 --> 00:41:26.013]  And I've got all that coming up third hour.
[00:41:26.434 --> 00:41:28.175]  Three stacks full of videos.
[00:41:28.615 --> 00:41:29.355]  Prince Charles.
[00:41:29.875 --> 00:41:30.636]  All of them saying it.
[00:41:32.145 --> 00:41:34.546]  Bill Gates, Ted Rose, all of them.
[00:41:36.907 --> 00:41:38.508]  The economy is energy.
[00:41:40.229 --> 00:41:42.870]  You cut it off, society collapses.
[00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:47.112]  With our sprawling cities, we're not even designed to be able to operate without it.
[00:41:47.132 --> 00:41:52.074]  If we were rural farms and spread out across the country, we don't need their fossil fuel.
[00:41:52.374 --> 00:41:55.015]  But they're holding us hostage and they know it.
[00:41:55.516 --> 00:42:04.669]   Here's George W. Bush, the war criminal, Henry Kissinger's footstool, Inadvertently talking about himself while he tries to attack Russia.
[00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:09.390]  In contrast, Russian elections are rigged.
[00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:17.631]  Political opponents are imprisoned or otherwise eliminated from participating in the electoral process.
[00:42:19.172 --> 00:42:32.201]   The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia and the decision of one man To launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq.
[00:42:32.802 --> 00:42:33.662]  I mean, of Ukraine.
[00:42:35.423 --> 00:42:35.824]  Iraq, too.
[00:42:35.964 --> 00:42:36.684]  Anyway.
[00:42:38.325 --> 00:42:36.684]  75.
[00:42:39.006 --> 00:42:42.328]  He'll be fine.
[00:42:44.249 --> 00:42:46.611]  I'm really good at killing people with drones.
[00:42:46.691 --> 00:42:47.351]  No, I'm serious.
[00:42:47.371 --> 00:42:48.912]  I'll kill you, said Obama.
[00:42:48.992 --> 00:42:49.693]  Oh, he's black.
[00:42:49.713 --> 00:42:50.534]  He can kill everyone.
[00:42:50.614 --> 00:42:51.274]  Oh, it's so liberal.
[00:42:52.975 --> 00:42:54.336]  Let's hear that one more time.
[00:42:55.437 --> 00:42:56.578]  Beyond a Freudian slip.
[00:42:56.598 --> 00:42:56.938]  Here it is.
[00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:11.460]  The result is an absence of checks and balances in Russia, and the decision of one man to launch a wholly unjustified and brutal invasion of Iraq.
[00:43:12.061 --> 00:43:12.942]  I mean, of Ukraine.
[00:43:14.703 --> 00:43:15.123]  Iraq, too.
[00:43:15.203 --> 00:43:15.464]  Anyway.
[00:43:15.484 --> 00:43:15.464]  75.
[00:43:15.684 --> 00:43:17.684]  (laughter)
[00:43:17.684 --> 00:43:19.684]  I'm 75.
[00:43:19.684 --> 00:43:21.684]  (laughter)
[00:43:21.684 --> 00:43:23.684]  Here's the...
[00:43:23.684 --> 00:43:30.043]   Alright ladies and gentlemen, let me just do this, if we get ready to end the hour and bring a special guest on with
[00:43:30.043 --> 00:43:30.684]  a big victory.
[00:43:30.812 --> 00:43:33.473]  Let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:43:33.493 --> 00:43:41.535]  I have a stack of mainline science reports and studies that the JMJ shot particularly is liquefying people's livers, including children.
[00:43:43.295 --> 00:43:45.456]  We have the giant stack on Biden handing over U.S.
[00:43:45.496 --> 00:43:49.497]  sovereignty to the World Health Organization and draft copies of the treaty leaking.
[00:43:51.237 --> 00:43:52.198]  They're already telling you what's in it.
[00:43:53.358 --> 00:44:00.394]   We have another NATO leader voices opposition to Sweden and Finland and Russia moves withdrawal from the WTO, WHO.
[00:44:02.794 --> 00:44:09.056]  We have unbelievable developments with the currencies of the world and inflation.
[00:44:10.956 --> 00:44:19.318]  We have the sexual harassment and brainwashing of five, six, seven-year-old children and transgenderism, where they're expelled if they don't learn all the pronouns.
[00:44:21.139 --> 00:44:22.219]  It's all coming up next hour.
[00:44:23.629 --> 00:44:28.174]  But I'm not going to sit here and even ask you to go to m4wrestore.com and buy great products that you already need.
[00:44:28.675 --> 00:44:29.576]  I appreciate your support.
[00:44:29.916 --> 00:44:30.877]  We've been getting a lot of support.
[00:44:30.938 --> 00:44:31.278]  Thank you.
[00:44:31.758 --> 00:44:32.800]  These are great products you already need.
[00:44:34.155 --> 00:44:44.584]  But I am going to ask you to pray for this broadcast, and I am going to ask you to tell everybody you know, as we go to break, on your email list, however, hey, Alex Jones is having a key guest on.
[00:44:44.924 --> 00:44:46.606]  Tune in now and see what you're not supposed to see.
[00:44:47.246 --> 00:44:49.468]  Text message some friends, some neighbors, some family, some strangers.
[00:44:49.828 --> 00:44:56.835]  Tell people that the resistance lives and is fighting as hard as it can with We The People at Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[00:44:57.668 --> 00:45:01.113]  Hour number two starts in T-minus two minutes.
[00:45:02.015 --> 00:45:03.117]  So much coming up today.
[00:45:02.937 --> 00:45:09.937]   And in the words of John Paul Jones, "I have only begun to fight."

[00:46:15.796 --> 00:46:21.456]   In the midst of the worst health crisis we're facing in more than a century, don't tell your supporters,
[00:46:21.456 --> 00:46:23.735]  don't be afraid of COVID.
[00:46:23.735 --> 00:46:25.936]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:46:25.936 --> 00:46:28.675]  (dramatic music)
[00:46:28.675 --> 00:46:39.696]  Don't tell your supporters, don't be afraid of COVID.
[00:46:39.813 --> 00:46:43.214]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:46:43.295 --> 00:46:47.176]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[00:46:48.596 --> 00:46:51.017]  I just want to say they gave me Regeneron.
[00:46:51.317 --> 00:46:54.755]   We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready.
[00:46:54.755 --> 00:46:58.916]   And if you're in the hospital and you're feeling really bad, we're going to work it so that you
[00:46:58.916 --> 00:47:02.675]   get them and you're going to get them free. And especially if you're a senior, we're going to get
[00:47:15.637 --> 00:47:21.717]   everyone should be afraid of COVID. Everyone should be afraid of COVID. Everyone should be afraid of
[00:47:21.717 --> 00:47:27.715]  COVID.
[00:47:27.965 --> 00:47:30.347]  Is there no one who can tell them don't do this?
[00:47:34.926 --> 00:47:37.729]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:47:37.789 --> 00:47:38.850]  Let me think, just let me think.
[00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:44.456]  I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[00:47:44.476 --> 00:47:45.897]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:47:45.937 --> 00:47:46.378]  Damn it!
[00:47:46.558 --> 00:47:46.878]  Why?
[00:47:47.599 --> 00:47:53.605]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:47:54.226 --> 00:47:57.109]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[00:48:00.126 --> 00:48:04.927]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:48:04.967 --> 00:48:05.947]  You decided, sir.
[00:48:05.987 --> 00:48:06.908]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:48:06.928 --> 00:48:08.328]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:48:08.588 --> 00:48:10.508]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:48:10.688 --> 00:48:12.089]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:48:12.489 --> 00:48:22.131]  And where once you had the freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and subverting your submission.
[00:48:22.171 --> 00:48:22.351]  Cameras.
[00:48:22.371 --> 00:48:23.031]  We need cameras.
[00:48:23.331 --> 00:48:24.732]  How did this happen?
[00:48:24.792 --> 00:48:25.532]  Who's to blame?
[00:48:26.533 --> 00:48:29.197]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:48:29.217 --> 00:48:31.059]  They will be held accountable.
[00:48:31.079 --> 00:48:36.988]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:48:38.186 --> 00:48:39.967]  I know why you did it.
[00:48:40.167 --> 00:48:42.467]  I know you were afraid, cooling me.
[00:48:42.908 --> 00:48:44.988]  War, terror, disease.
[00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:51.951]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:48:52.031 --> 00:48:57.773]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:48:58.233 --> 00:49:05.233]   He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:49:05.233 --> 00:49:13.233]  There is a war.
[00:49:12.994 --> 00:49:13.994]  It's happening now.
[00:49:14.855 --> 00:49:16.676]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:49:17.236 --> 00:49:19.037]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:49:19.838 --> 00:49:21.299]  We are the resistance.
[00:49:21.539 --> 00:49:23.539]  We are the InfoWar.
[00:49:23.539 --> 00:49:44.539]  [Music]
[00:49:44.539 --> 00:49:46.539]  I'm watching the midterms.
[00:49:46.675 --> 00:49:50.077]  Man, you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[00:49:50.538 --> 00:49:53.060]  This guy is like, they're coming from Guatemala.
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:54.221]  They're coming from Mexico.
[00:49:58.204 --> 00:50:00.045]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.
[00:50:00.286 --> 00:50:01.547]  You voted Trump!
[00:50:01.607 --> 00:50:03.889]  You voted Trump!
[00:50:03.929 --> 00:50:04.169]  Yeah!
[00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:11.074]  I don't want to be president!
[00:50:11.094 --> 00:50:13.016]  I don't want to!
[00:50:13.436 --> 00:50:14.237]  You're the president.
[00:50:16.162 --> 00:50:17.002]  What's the word?
[00:50:17.002 --> 00:50:17.841]  (beep)
[00:50:17.841 --> 00:50:18.662]  Muslims.
[00:50:18.662 --> 00:50:21.402]  (crowd cheering)
[00:50:21.402 --> 00:50:41.361]   And you would think everybody in the country is just like, to the bunker.
[00:50:41.361 --> 00:50:44.102]  (dramatic music)
[00:50:44.102 --> 00:50:46.841]  (dramatic music)
[00:50:47.302 --> 00:50:50.042]  (dramatic music)
[00:50:50.042 --> 00:50:52.802]  (dramatic music)
[00:50:52.802 --> 00:50:55.542]  (dramatic music)
[00:50:55.542 --> 00:50:58.281]  (dramatic music)
[00:50:58.281 --> 00:51:01.021]  (dramatic music)
[00:51:01.021 --> 00:51:03.781]  (dramatic music)
[00:51:03.781 --> 00:51:06.521]  (dramatic music)
[00:51:06.521 --> 00:51:09.262]  (dramatic music)
[00:51:09.262 --> 00:51:12.002]  (dramatic music)
[00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:14.762]  (dramatic music)
[00:51:14.762 --> 00:51:17.341]  (crowd cheering)
[00:51:17.341 --> 00:51:21.942]   Well, he was on with us several times, a year and a half ago, during the thick of the lockdowns
[00:51:21.942 --> 00:51:24.541]  that Fauci now says doesn't exist.
[00:51:24.541 --> 00:51:34.541]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:51:25.938 --> 00:51:36.225]  Pastor Tony Spell arrested, demonized, fined, attacked, church shut down for refusing to close while they let all the big box stores continue to operate.
[00:51:36.586 --> 00:51:39.888]  Congress has no authority over religion and the First Amendment.
[00:51:40.648 --> 00:51:46.693]  And now, major ruling says that it was unconstitutional what happened to this man.
[00:51:47.705 --> 00:51:52.087]  The days of criminal trouble are all over for Central Pastor Tony Spell.
[00:51:52.147 --> 00:51:59.591]  Today, the State Supreme Court dismissed all charges against him and said the governor's COVID restrictions on worship actually violated his rights.
[00:51:59.951 --> 00:52:06.594]  While there's still a civil case pending, the pastor and his attorney told us today's ruling could shape future emergency orders from the government.
[00:52:08.581 --> 00:52:10.563]  I'm glad we listened to God and not the governor.
[00:52:10.883 --> 00:52:21.973]  Pastor Tony Spell says he's already planning a triumphant Sunday sermon following a state Supreme Court decision that declared state COVID restrictions violated his First Amendment rights.
[00:52:22.613 --> 00:52:35.204]  We've been mocked, we've been ridiculed, we've been slandered, defamed, but now we're thankful that we have finally been vindicated by the highest court in the state of Louisiana.
[00:52:35.544 --> 00:52:47.169]  Spell was arrested in April of 2020, accused of violating executive orders from Governor John Bel Edwards that laid out restrictions on businesses and in-person gatherings during the peak of the pandemic.
[00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:54.093]  Despite those orders, Spell continued to hold massive in-person services at Life Tabernacle Church in Central.
[00:52:54.833 --> 00:53:04.299]  In a 19-page ruling, State Justice William J. Crane overturned lower court rulings saying the governor's COVID restrictions violated First Amendment rights.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:17.208]  Specifically, the justice argues the state could not prove that large church gatherings posed a greater risk of exposure to the virus than shopping at a secular business or attending work as an essential employee.
[00:53:17.468 --> 00:53:24.418]   The ruling can be summed up in this line, "We interpret Pastor Spell's request not as one for special treatment,
[00:53:24.418 --> 00:53:25.868]  but for equal treatment."
[00:53:25.868 --> 00:53:27.868]  "You know, there's a lot of politics against us."
[00:53:27.868 --> 00:53:32.067]   Spell's attorney, Jeff Wittenbrink, believes the ruling will set a new precedent for future...
[00:53:32.099 --> 00:53:44.330]  The implications long term are that from now on, when there's an emergency, the justice has made it clear that government has to pay attention to those rights that we have that are protected by the Constitution.
[00:53:45.879 --> 00:53:50.225]  The governor's office also responded to the ruling saying, while they disagree, they accept it.
[00:53:50.585 --> 00:53:57.414]  He said in part, each and every action Governor Edwards took throughout the COVID pandemic was done with the goal of protecting their congregations.
[00:53:57.655 --> 00:54:00.375]  You can read his full statement and the ruling in full.
[00:54:00.375 --> 00:54:09.014]   It's the first amendment, not the second, not the fifth, not the tenth, not the twentieth.
[00:54:09.135 --> 00:54:09.855]  It's the first.
[00:54:10.555 --> 00:54:25.220]  Congress shall make no law respecting and establishing religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or the press, or the right of the people to peaceably assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievance.
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:32.334]   But it's not just equal treatment That local governments and the national government should give.
[00:54:32.654 --> 00:54:40.937]  The country was founded over religious freedom and there is no jurisdiction over the church because we do not have a state religion.
[00:54:41.017 --> 00:54:42.538]  We are not Iran.
[00:54:45.151 --> 00:54:48.734]  We are the United States of America and people came here for their religious freedom.
[00:54:48.994 --> 00:54:59.481]  Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:55:00.002 --> 00:55:04.085]  Our entire Bill of Rights starts with those words.
[00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:21.362]  Congress shall make no, no, no, no, no, no law respecting the establishment or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:55:22.481 --> 00:55:24.944]  Pastor Spell got demonized on national news.
[00:55:25.324 --> 00:55:26.605]  He got attacked as a criminal.
[00:55:26.866 --> 00:55:28.007]  He was a horrible person.
[00:55:28.607 --> 00:55:35.174]  While the Walmarts and the Targets and the topless bars were open, the left worldwide, not just here, said churches need to stay shut.
[00:55:35.434 --> 00:55:37.817]  There are still pastors in Canada in jail!
[00:55:40.379 --> 00:55:43.200]  Many of them held without bond for what's happening here.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:49.123]  So what Tony Spell has done with his strength and his honor and his very successful, powerful church is amazing.
[00:55:49.663 --> 00:55:51.684]  LTCBR.com.
[00:55:52.424 --> 00:55:53.545]  Tony Spell on YouTube.
[00:55:53.945 --> 00:56:02.128]  I'm not going to go over his whole background, but he is a faithful visionary of life, tabernacle church, a multicultural and multi-generational church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
[00:56:02.568 --> 00:56:10.236]   He and his beautiful wife, Since 2009, he is known as the Pentecostal Apostle.
[00:56:10.616 --> 00:56:17.645]  Faith because of his unwavering faith in Almighty God, his powerful preaching, and his intense laboring in the Gospel.
[00:56:18.942 --> 00:56:20.043]  And he joins us now.
[00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:26.867]  Thank God for the First Amendment, but thank God for him making them force the issue when so many others buckled and backed down.
[00:56:27.347 --> 00:56:33.371]  I go to a lot of different churches in Austin, some non-denominational, some others.
[00:56:33.391 --> 00:56:34.131]  I have a lot of friends.
[00:56:34.171 --> 00:56:35.272]  We go to different churches every week.
[00:56:35.632 --> 00:56:38.974]  The point is, is that most of them were shut down, even though they're good people.
[00:56:39.254 --> 00:56:40.315]  They followed those orders.
[00:56:40.375 --> 00:56:42.796]  You didn't follow those orders, sir.
[00:56:43.116 --> 00:56:44.557]  This is a big, big deal.
[00:56:44.597 --> 00:56:45.678]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:56:47.369 --> 00:56:48.029]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:49.330]  It's good to be with you again.
[00:56:49.350 --> 00:57:00.275]  Throughout the ages, men have suffered death rather than to subordinate their allegiance to Almighty God over to the authority of the state.
[00:57:01.216 --> 00:57:06.799]  Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, William Evans Hughes in 1931.
[00:57:07.859 --> 00:57:16.421]   We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable Rights.
[00:57:16.921 --> 00:57:29.006]  Inalienable means the government did not give us the right to practice our religion and peaceably assemble, therefore they cannot take from us our rights to practice our religion and freely assemble.
[00:57:29.366 --> 00:57:40.050]  Now, of course, in March the 17th, 2020, our tyrant of a governor, King John Bel Edwards, thought that he could close down the churches.
[00:57:41.099 --> 00:57:52.604]  And he learned differently, because not only did he not close our church, but because of his afflicting us, we multiplied and grew.
[00:57:52.785 --> 00:58:08.992]  Over 2,500 people since that day have been water baptized in our church, people have been healed of incurable diseases, and people in our congregation found hope and help and life in a time of death, in a time of religious persecution.
[00:58:09.577 --> 00:58:18.484]  Now, NBC News there, in your lead-up to this story, said that spells sought equal but not greater than protection.
[00:58:19.184 --> 00:58:38.339]  If that's all they pulled out of this 29-page verdict by the Louisiana Supreme Court, which these Supreme Court justices, five out of seven, said, everything that the governor did to us for the past 27 months was illegal and unconstitutional.
[00:58:39.187 --> 00:58:41.267]  We did not ask for equal protection.
[00:58:41.747 --> 00:58:45.288]  What we said, Alex, is that Congress should make no law.
[00:58:45.608 --> 00:58:52.829]  Meaning, if the Congress cannot do it, what give the executive branch the idea that they could?
[00:58:53.750 --> 00:59:17.695]   And what you can take away from this 5-2 ruling, which was the greatest win for religious freedom in American history over 245 years, and it's the greatest win because there's never been A time in our nation's history where the churches were demanded to be closed while liquor stores were open and abortion clinics were open and retail stores were open.
[00:59:18.236 --> 00:59:33.789]   What you could take away is, is that these judges said, as judges, we have no more noble duty than to preserve the rights of our citizens from And protect them from government overreach.
[00:59:34.129 --> 00:59:40.413]  Therefore, we find the governor's orders against the defendant unconstitutional.
[00:59:40.893 --> 00:59:44.375]  They're talking like the framers of the United States of America.
[00:59:44.795 --> 00:59:59.783]  And where better to have a win than in Louisiana, the great state of Louisiana, where a Democratic governor, who is the poster child for the Biden policies and for democratic policies.
[01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:06.574]  And even in a Republican-led legislature, we got no help from the legislature.
[01:00:06.954 --> 01:00:18.042]  We got several losses in the district, federal, and the circuit courts, but now the highest court in the state of Louisiana came through for us in 5-2.
[01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:24.246]  They said things like that your religious rights are inviolate.
[01:00:25.123 --> 01:00:27.305]  Meaning, you cannot violate them.
[01:00:27.626 --> 01:00:29.668]  You do not have the authority to violate them.
[01:00:29.788 --> 01:00:32.370]  They said that our religious rights are inalienable.
[01:00:33.031 --> 01:00:39.598]  There was only one written dissent, and that was by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Weimer.
[01:00:40.287 --> 01:00:44.371]  Who had zero law in his two and a half page dissent.
[01:00:44.572 --> 01:00:46.572]  It was all emotional and sensational.
[01:00:46.572 --> 01:00:51.451]   Pesterspell, I can tell, we're gonna post a link in the live show feed to the ruling,
[01:00:51.451 --> 01:00:54.771]   but I can tell you wanna go through it, so we're gonna give you the floor when we come back.
[01:00:54.771 --> 01:00:57.972]  And this is amazing, stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:00:57.972 --> 01:01:01.771]   And you know, America's not perfect, but compared to the rest of the world, it's incredible.
[01:01:01.502 --> 01:01:05.766]  Because it's founding ideas were ordained and inspired by God.
[01:01:06.346 --> 01:01:15.217]   And I have to thank Pastor Tony Spell in Louisiana and Baton Rouge for his courage for my children's Birthright and their future.
[01:01:15.978 --> 01:01:19.140]  Because our ancestors fought for freedom and now we've got to do it.
[01:01:19.721 --> 01:01:22.543]  And he stood up and he got arrested and he got shut down.
[01:01:22.563 --> 01:01:23.204]  He got fined.
[01:01:23.224 --> 01:01:23.764]  He got attacked.
[01:01:24.064 --> 01:01:28.027]  But he persevered and now has had this big victory that they're trying to black out.
[01:01:28.548 --> 01:01:29.548]  They're trying to shut down.
[01:01:29.568 --> 01:01:30.329]  They're trying to cover up.
[01:01:30.369 --> 01:01:31.330]  But here's what's really important.
[01:01:33.885 --> 01:01:35.165]  Just as important as what I just said.
[01:01:36.046 --> 01:01:40.147]  Fauci and the UN have announced they got plans for new lockdowns after the midterms.
[01:01:40.567 --> 01:01:42.447]  This is their planetary control system.
[01:01:43.087 --> 01:01:44.928]  This is their world treaty they're getting set up.
[01:01:44.968 --> 01:01:49.949]  This is how the beast system's coming in with this digital tracking vaccine passport.
[01:01:49.989 --> 01:01:53.890]  So the tip of the spear is what Pastor Spell is doing.
[01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:55.470]  You've got the ruling right there.
[01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:58.951]  It's a big deal for the First Amendment, for the press, not just for churches.
[01:01:59.351 --> 01:02:00.552]  It's absolutely amazing.
[01:02:00.572 --> 01:02:01.552]  Please continue, Pastor.
[01:02:02.941 --> 01:02:19.845]  On page 7 of this beautiful 5-2 precedent-setting ruling from the Louisiana Supreme Court, Justice Crane stated, No liberty is more essential to the continued vitality of the free society which our Constitution guarantees than is the religious liberty.
[01:02:20.145 --> 01:02:26.366]  The most sacred right to freely exercise one's religion is both fundamental and inalienable.
[01:02:28.066 --> 01:02:42.946]   So, for the past 27 months, As I've said, we've been arrested, put on house arrests, forbidden to travel, been out of the city of Baton Rouge four times in the past 27 months because of bond restrictions and what have you.
[01:02:43.306 --> 01:02:46.827]  However, the victory came on Friday the 13th.
[01:02:47.087 --> 01:02:56.288]  That used to be the day notoriously and infamously noted as an evil day for nightmares and murder and what have you in Hollywood.
[01:02:56.728 --> 01:03:11.093]   But the Louisiana Supreme Court have now taken that day For the Lord Jesus Christ, when they said your rights were violated because you were arrested for holding church during the pandemic.
[01:03:11.733 --> 01:03:14.836]  Now, Alex, something very important to take away.
[01:03:15.577 --> 01:03:37.028]   If Amera will last long enough, In the history books, you can quote State of Louisiana versus Spell, instead of the 1906 Jacobson versus Massachusetts, where the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in favor of a Swedish-born pastor because he refused to take the smallpox vaccine, and he claimed religious exemption.
[01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:52.327]   You won't have to quote Smith versus Division of Employment, State of Oregon, who was terminated from his job because this Native American With smoke peyote as part of his religious conviction and worship, ceremonial rights.
[01:03:52.967 --> 01:03:59.891]  And he won, of course, in the Supreme Court because he was terminated from his employer in the state of Oregon.
[01:04:00.291 --> 01:04:01.993]  You won't have to quote that anymore.
[01:04:02.593 --> 01:04:09.277]  We have pure as the driven snow, the purest wind in religious history in our great nation.
[01:04:10.464 --> 01:04:18.127]  In the 5-2 State of Louisiana versus Spell, where they wanted to imprison me for six months per violation.
[01:04:18.627 --> 01:04:23.529]  Six months per violation, without fines, but six months of imprisonment.
[01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:26.330]  And we were facing several years in prison.
[01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:37.294]  But these beautiful justices in the great state of Louisiana came through and said, Governor John Bel Edwards, what you've done was unconstitutional legal.
[01:04:38.034 --> 01:04:43.103]   His emergency orders We're so irrelevant and full of holes.
[01:04:43.823 --> 01:04:50.024]  They say in here that going to and from an individual's place of worship was legal.
[01:04:50.404 --> 01:04:53.244]  However, you could not go into the place of worship.
[01:04:53.824 --> 01:05:07.687]  They go on to say that you could go into a retail store with hundreds where 10,000 cars would go into a retail store several several hundred feet from my church on a day-to-day basis.
[01:05:08.308 --> 01:05:20.750]  But if the same people would walk across the street into a cavernous 106,000 square feet building on 41 acres, they would be arrested and cited for violation of the law.
[01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:23.591]  Number one, there was no law made.
[01:05:24.291 --> 01:05:25.711]  We never broke a law.
[01:05:26.071 --> 01:05:29.552]  However, the executives broke laws.
[01:05:29.632 --> 01:05:31.032]  The governors broke laws.
[01:05:31.212 --> 01:05:32.532]  The mayors broke laws.
[01:05:33.152 --> 01:05:36.993]  These lesser magistrates, policemen and sheriffs broke laws.
[01:05:37.594 --> 01:05:41.556]  Whenever they arrested us and forbade us to preach.
[01:05:42.016 --> 01:05:43.377]  You know what this has been about?
[01:05:43.777 --> 01:05:45.698]  It's spiritual warfare, Alex.
[01:05:45.778 --> 01:05:52.942]  We just had a Health Freedom Rally where people like Dr. Peter McCullough and Drs.
[01:05:53.002 --> 01:05:56.544]  Rhett Magellan came together and said, this has all been spiritual.
[01:05:57.144 --> 01:06:02.387]  The virus and the attack against the church and the First Amendment has been spiritual.
[01:06:02.627 --> 01:06:04.228]  So it's spiritual warfare.
[01:06:05.069 --> 01:06:13.838]  I'm glad McCullough, who's in the studio tomorrow, said that, because privately, I said, you've looked at this, you're a smart guy, a renowned scientist, not a cardiologist, I said, what do you think is happening?
[01:06:13.858 --> 01:06:15.099]  He said, it's being directed by Satan.
[01:06:15.539 --> 01:06:18.762]  You look at how they're doing it, it's so sophisticated, it's that mystery of evil.
[01:06:20.344 --> 01:06:23.747]  It is the mystery of iniquity that already worked.
[01:06:24.168 --> 01:06:25.509]  Only he who now letteth.
[01:06:25.889 --> 01:06:29.653]  The word let in the Greek of 2 Thessalonians 2, 7 means the hinder.
[01:06:30.188 --> 01:06:38.550]  That means you and I are hindering this Antichrist spirit government from taking over our nation.
[01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:43.211]  Because we know that if America falls, the rest of the world falls.
[01:06:43.311 --> 01:06:48.932]  And how obvious, to interrupt Pastor, you're on target here, is that they've attacked churches not just here but worldwide during these lockdowns.
[01:06:48.992 --> 01:06:50.713]  It shows they fear the brethren.
[01:06:50.733 --> 01:06:51.813]  Talk about multiculturalism.
[01:06:52.133 --> 01:06:56.014]  Your church is the example of love and coming together and what they fear.
[01:06:58.117 --> 01:06:59.158]  27 different nationalities.
[01:06:59.198 --> 01:07:02.960]  They hate that because they win through division and conquering.
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.001]  But we have perfect unity.
[01:07:05.061 --> 01:07:10.344]  Behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity.
[01:07:10.564 --> 01:07:14.246]  That's why they want it as six feet apart, because they don't want us together.
[01:07:14.507 --> 01:07:16.908]  That's why they want it as muzzled and masked.
[01:07:17.403 --> 01:07:27.027]  Because the first thing they did in these Western movies when they hung someone was that they covered their face so they become an inanimate object and they dehumanize them.
[01:07:27.327 --> 01:07:28.568]  And that's what they tried to do.
[01:07:29.028 --> 01:07:40.593]  For 27 months, 336 services of breaking their fake laws and holding unrestrained, unlimited gatherings in our local church.
[01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:46.376]  We had zero masking, zero vaxxing, zero socialism distancing.
[01:07:46.761 --> 01:07:47.361]  And you know what?
[01:07:47.842 --> 01:07:52.365]  The Supreme Court in the state of Louisiana said, you were right.
[01:07:53.425 --> 01:08:11.757]  Alex, 39 buses go out every Sunday morning from this church, covering an 80 mile radius, bringing in all races of people, all walks of life, all political persuasions, bringing them in where we feed them a hot meal.
[01:08:12.461 --> 01:08:14.863]  And then we give them spiritual food.
[01:08:15.183 --> 01:08:17.424]  And then we have baptisms and pray for people.
[01:08:17.745 --> 01:08:19.006]  And you know what we're telling them?
[01:08:19.586 --> 01:08:23.749]  We're telling them that God is greater than the virus.
[01:08:23.989 --> 01:08:25.610]  Faith is stronger than fear.
[01:08:26.110 --> 01:08:32.095]  And because of that, as I've stated, incurable diseases have been healed and so much.
[01:08:32.675 --> 01:08:42.468]   But now our attorney, Jeff Wittenbrink, who is our local representation, Chief Justice Roy Moore, Who also represents us.
[01:08:43.068 --> 01:08:51.272]  Here's what Jeff Wittenbrink, he said to me, he said, Pastor, the First Amendment does not give you your right to go to church and peaceably assemble.
[01:08:51.692 --> 01:08:56.955]  The First Amendment protects your right to practice your religion, go to church and peaceably assemble.
[01:08:57.555 --> 01:09:06.539]  Your right and duty to go to church and practice your religion is endowed to you by your Creator, God Almighty.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:09.521]  And that's who the government wants to be.
[01:09:09.963 --> 01:09:12.545]  There are some pockets of resistance in government.
[01:09:13.106 --> 01:09:14.367]  Let's talk about that, Pastor.
[01:09:14.387 --> 01:09:14.887]  Gotta go to break.
[01:09:14.907 --> 01:09:15.308]  We'll come back.
[01:09:15.348 --> 01:09:15.928]  You're on fire.
[01:09:15.948 --> 01:09:16.389]  Stay with us.
[01:09:17.530 --> 01:09:22.534]  You know, we can't forget about the pastors arrested in Europe and the UK and Canada and the U.S.
[01:09:23.415 --> 01:09:26.798]  Pastor Arthur Pawlowski held for months without bail, now on house arrest.
[01:09:27.278 --> 01:09:33.724]  Arrested, what, six times for preaching the gospel and keeping his church open in Canada.
[01:09:34.946 --> 01:09:36.448]  That is what is going on.
[01:09:37.289 --> 01:09:38.531]  That is what is happening.
[01:09:39.072 --> 01:09:45.300]  Their desire from the UN down is to shut down our religious freedom and particularly target Christians.
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.107]  The UN even admits the last decade persecution of Christians doubled and then tripled.
[01:09:50.808 --> 01:09:52.650]  The level it was just a decade ago.
[01:09:52.710 --> 01:09:55.933]  This is a satanic world government being announced.
[01:09:56.093 --> 01:09:58.275]  Mark of the Beast, implantable microchips.
[01:09:58.355 --> 01:09:59.516]  Next hour I'm going to cover all that.
[01:09:59.536 --> 01:10:02.579]  But Pastor Tony Spell, we know there's going to be a giant revival.
[01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:03.700]  The Bible tells us so.
[01:10:04.221 --> 01:10:07.404]  During this period, we have the Great Falling Away and the Great Awakening.
[01:10:07.464 --> 01:10:26.437]   I'm not going to pretend to be a theologian or to even guess when Christ comes like a thief in the night, but clearly Prophecies being fulfilled, and this historic victory you've had, and I've read the ruling as well, it's posted on Infowars.com, the live show feed is just incredible, and the media spends it like, oh, you're out of trouble now, okay, you were bad, but the court said it was okay.
[01:10:26.477 --> 01:10:28.439]  No, they violated our rights.
[01:10:28.519 --> 01:10:29.699]  They violated your rights.
[01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:34.722]  They violated our sacred First Amendment that, as you said, guards our God-given rights.
[01:10:34.802 --> 01:10:37.044]  This is a raping that we've been through.
[01:10:37.104 --> 01:10:38.645]  You did your duty.
[01:10:38.705 --> 01:10:52.089]   You held fast And now you've been vindicated, but the fight is so important because we know more lockdowns are coming, as I said, and we know that it is the First Amendment that stands against forced inoculations and stands against martial law.
[01:10:52.649 --> 01:10:53.710]  And so thank you again.
[01:10:53.730 --> 01:10:55.110]  I know you don't want the thanks, but it's true.
[01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:57.231]  And your congregation is standing with you.
[01:10:57.271 --> 01:11:00.491]  And I know I read it got even bigger once this persecution happened.
[01:11:00.511 --> 01:11:05.593]  So if we just lean into the attack and don't cower, God will use us for greater things.
[01:11:05.633 --> 01:11:06.173]  Is that not true?
[01:11:07.554 --> 01:11:08.974]  That is the absolute truth.
[01:11:09.034 --> 01:11:10.255]  Ephesians 6.10.
[01:11:10.355 --> 01:11:14.436]  Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
[01:11:14.816 --> 01:11:20.077]  Your strength is either derived from God Almighty or from another power.
[01:11:20.737 --> 01:11:22.398]  Saul was the people's choice.
[01:11:23.398 --> 01:11:25.899]  He was head and shoulders above every man in Israel.
[01:11:26.259 --> 01:11:30.580]  However, before he died a suicide, he consorted with witches.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:34.021]  He derived his power from another world, hell itself.
[01:11:34.574 --> 01:11:37.636]  So, there are two classes of people in government today.
[01:11:37.736 --> 01:11:40.597]  See, as Lewis said, there's no neutral ground in the universe.
[01:11:41.138 --> 01:11:45.440]  Every square inch, every split second is either claimed by God or counterclaimed by the devil.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:47.101]  So, here we are.
[01:11:47.561 --> 01:12:00.048]  We wrestle not against flesh and blood, Ephesians 6, 12, but against principalities, number one, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, three, and against spiritual wickedness in high places.
[01:12:00.568 --> 01:12:01.729]  Political powers.
[01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:04.834]  Supreme Court powers in the judicial branch.
[01:12:05.415 --> 01:12:09.436]  Legislative powers in the Senate and the Congress and in the executive branch.
[01:12:09.897 --> 01:12:15.919]  There are individuals that are possessed by God Almighty or they are possessed by Satan.
[01:12:16.239 --> 01:12:18.060]  And that's what we're fighting against.
[01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:23.363]  It's not, it's not Crazy Joe or it's not Kamala and her cackling.
[01:12:23.863 --> 01:12:30.366]  It's not King Edwards and his anti-God, godless orders that he gives.
[01:12:30.902 --> 01:12:35.464]  These people are empowered and possessed by another world.
[01:12:35.985 --> 01:12:37.685]  And we have righteous leaders.
[01:12:37.725 --> 01:12:41.587]  When the righteous are in power, the people rejoice.
[01:12:41.907 --> 01:12:46.150]  But when the unrighteous are in power, the people mourn because we know it's tyranny.
[01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:47.190]  So what do we have?
[01:12:48.091 --> 01:12:49.171]  Principalities.
[01:12:49.391 --> 01:12:51.832]  America has a principality right now.
[01:12:52.273 --> 01:12:54.734]  And there is loneliness that has come upon us.
[01:12:55.296 --> 01:13:00.979]  And even greater loneliness because of the seclusion and the reclusiveness that came from the lockdowns.
[01:13:01.319 --> 01:13:03.521]  Therefore, we have an identity crisis.
[01:13:04.121 --> 01:13:12.826]  You have the LGBTQ community that wants to inculcate into our children this spiritual wickedness.
[01:13:13.736 --> 01:13:22.240]  And the homos and the fags and the twinkies and the queers, they want to redefine what humanity is, like we have an identity crisis.
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:26.042]  No, man is made in God's image and after his likeness.
[01:13:26.642 --> 01:13:29.123]  We, the male and female, created he them.
[01:13:29.483 --> 01:13:30.764]  That's who we represent.
[01:13:31.204 --> 01:13:34.625]  God, our Father, and the church is our mother.
[01:13:34.925 --> 01:13:38.267]  That's why there's an attack to want to close down the church, Alex.
[01:13:38.667 --> 01:13:43.693]   They know if they can muzzle The preachers and the churches and close them.
[01:13:44.033 --> 01:13:45.814]  The next thing to go is the press.
[01:13:46.374 --> 01:13:49.535]  And then the next thing to go will be assembly.
[01:13:49.895 --> 01:13:52.136]  All assemblies will be deemed illegal.
[01:13:52.716 --> 01:13:53.277]  That's what Hitler did.
[01:13:53.337 --> 01:13:56.998]  And those Hitler things, by weaponizing the courts, they're not all controls.
[01:13:57.038 --> 01:13:58.979]  We just proved here with you, your great work.
[01:13:59.079 --> 01:14:04.541]  And then we've also got the attacks on our medical freedom and we've got the attacks on just everything.
[01:14:06.181 --> 01:14:06.921]  Exactly right.
[01:14:07.481 --> 01:14:09.542]  Spiritual wickedness in high places.
[01:14:09.882 --> 01:14:14.144]  Now, though we walk in the flesh, Alex, we do not war after the flesh.
[01:14:14.464 --> 01:14:17.425]  I appreciate what you said in your previous segment.
[01:14:18.205 --> 01:14:19.265]  Who do we go after?
[01:14:19.325 --> 01:14:20.626]  Do we storm the capital?
[01:14:20.646 --> 01:14:21.686]  Do we take up arms?
[01:14:22.606 --> 01:14:24.707]  There's too many of them in the flesh.
[01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:29.148]  We have to use spiritual weapons to fight a spiritual battle.
[01:14:29.208 --> 01:14:32.629]  If we fight carnal battles with carnal weapons, carnality wins.
[01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.330]  So we need spiritual weapons.
[01:14:35.091 --> 01:14:39.352]  And this is a sharp two-edged sword, this Bible is.
[01:14:39.372 --> 01:14:43.094]  66 books, 1189 chapters, 31,102 verses.
[01:14:43.814 --> 01:14:45.674]  Here's what we pray every day.
[01:14:46.395 --> 01:14:47.915]  Every day and throughout the day.
[01:14:48.315 --> 01:14:51.256]  And I want our audience to pray this as well.
[01:14:51.276 --> 01:14:52.617]  Please, Pastor, lead us in prayer.
[01:14:52.697 --> 01:14:53.657]  Pastor Tony Spell.
[01:14:54.797 --> 01:14:55.437]  Jeremiah 17, 18.
[01:14:56.958 --> 01:14:59.959]  Let them be confounded that persecute me.
[01:15:00.558 --> 01:15:02.360]  Only let not me be confounded.
[01:15:02.741 --> 01:15:04.322]  Let them be dismayed.
[01:15:04.723 --> 01:15:06.405]  Only let not me be dismayed.
[01:15:06.765 --> 01:15:11.630]  Bring upon them the day of trouble and destroy them with double destruction.
[01:15:12.051 --> 01:15:14.473]  That's what Jeremiah prayed in the Old Testament.
[01:15:14.794 --> 01:15:16.616]  He knew his enemies were too big.
[01:15:16.976 --> 01:15:21.461]  He knew the opposition and the fierce force for what?
[01:15:21.946 --> 01:15:30.571]  Whenever you tell me that I have to vaccinate to go into the, they wouldn't even let me in the Louisiana Supreme Court with my attorneys.
[01:15:31.012 --> 01:15:31.652]  Do you know why?
[01:15:32.012 --> 01:15:38.856]  Because I was, I did, I was unvaccinated and I refused to put on a mask and the Supreme Court took note of that.
[01:15:39.236 --> 01:15:49.383]   Now, when you tell me that in order to go across the threshold of my courthouse, That I have to have this in my veins, this needle in my veins?
[01:15:49.624 --> 01:15:51.745]  That is apocalyptic territory, Alex.
[01:15:52.106 --> 01:15:58.471]  Revelation 13, 17, it says that no man might buy or sell save he had the name, the number, or the mark.
[01:15:58.731 --> 01:16:00.773]  That is apocalyptic territory.
[01:16:01.094 --> 01:16:20.752]   Tory, when you tell me that I have to mask or I have to vaccinate, In order to go to this school or go to this church, would you believe that there are actually religious organizations right now that put the unvaccinated lower class people in the balcony and the vaccinated people on the floor in general population?
[01:16:21.152 --> 01:16:22.733]  That's spiritual wickedness.
[01:16:23.173 --> 01:16:36.042]  Whenever you tell us that we can't go to a job or can't go to a place of worship or a place of business because we don't have our car, we're no longer the great republic that we once were.
[01:16:36.423 --> 01:16:43.087]  But I'm telling you, there is hope because of this ruling on Friday the 13th of May 2022, Alex.
[01:16:43.948 --> 01:16:45.269]  All of that has gone away.
[01:16:46.209 --> 01:17:00.019]   We had law on our side, but now the judges Five out of seven judges in the Louisiana Supreme Court says, you can go to State of Louisiana versus Spell and you can tell your employer, no, I'm not going to vaccinate.
[01:17:00.379 --> 01:17:03.321]  You can tell that place of business, no, I'm not going to mask.
[01:17:03.721 --> 01:17:08.585]  You can tell your pastor, you can tell them, we can keep our church open.
[01:17:09.046 --> 01:17:10.827]  We're not going to be arrested again.
[01:17:10.867 --> 01:17:12.648]  We're not going to be persecuted again.
[01:17:13.109 --> 01:17:14.550]  This is a beautiful win.
[01:17:15.143 --> 01:17:18.244]  And it's the purest win in America's history.
[01:17:18.704 --> 01:17:21.444]  I've read the ruling and I've talked to lawyers that are involved.
[01:17:22.525 --> 01:17:23.525]  First Amendment issues, you're right.
[01:17:24.045 --> 01:17:29.766]  This is the strongest, purest ruling at the key time when we know they're coming for us again.
[01:17:31.626 --> 01:17:39.628]  Back when you were saying no and being arrested and all this, obviously you were doing it because you knew it was the right thing, but did you have faith?
[01:17:39.668 --> 01:17:41.909]  Did you know that you'd be victorious?
[01:17:44.249 --> 01:17:52.893]  Well, I knew that I'd be victorious in God, but I was standing on the Word of God, Alex, and the Word of God clearly stated, do not forsake the assembling.
[01:17:52.953 --> 01:17:54.734]  The word means synagoguing in Greek.
[01:17:54.754 --> 01:17:58.055]  It means going to church of ourselves together.
[01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:07.920]  And we had over 105 verses like that from the Bible in this particular lawsuit, in our civil case, which is ultimately going to go to the United States Supreme Court.
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:20.237]   Okay, whenever I bonded out of the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison, And then Judge Fred T. Crafasti from the 19th Judicial District Court fitted me in an ankle bracelet and forbid me to leave the front door of my house.
[01:18:20.878 --> 01:18:29.221]  The majority of my church came through my doors here at my home, and I met with my two sons, my daughter, my son and grandsons, and wife.
[01:18:29.841 --> 01:18:41.905]  And I said, you know, a conviction, neither the five things tell you if you have a conviction, neither the pressure of your friends, your family, lawsuit, jail, or death will stop you from practicing that.
[01:18:42.512 --> 01:18:49.162]  Well, we all knew that I would go into the prison until the court system opened, which was an indefinite amount of time.
[01:18:49.483 --> 01:18:49.863]  Stay there.
[01:18:49.883 --> 01:18:50.544]  Final segment.
[01:18:50.564 --> 01:18:50.965]  Incredible.
[01:18:50.985 --> 01:18:52.187]  Pastor Tony Spell, stay with us.
[01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:57.054]  Well, he hadn't been on this in over a year, and I look forward to speaking to him again in the future.
[01:18:57.918 --> 01:19:00.840]  We really appreciate the incredible work he's doing, fighting tyranny at every level.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:02.941]  Pastor Tony Spells, our guest here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:03.562 --> 01:19:10.206]  Final segment, and I've been asking a lot of questions, but I want to try to give him the floor to cover any other angles or areas he wants to hit.
[01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:16.510]  He got caught up by the break talking about when he was put in jail, when he was facing prison, when they put the ankle bracelet on him.
[01:19:16.650 --> 01:19:17.550]  He wasn't ashamed of that.
[01:19:17.991 --> 01:19:25.685]   He knew he was following the footsteps of other leaders that God has risen up and stood up Against this and now he's been victorious. That's my
[01:19:25.685 --> 01:19:29.956]   greatest frustration Cuz I've been on here 28 years and every time I don't back
[01:19:29.956 --> 01:19:33.355]   down and something bad happens and I just say I trust you God
[01:19:33.355 --> 01:19:39.355]   We get stronger on the other side. It's it's amazing. We worship the real God that made the universe
[01:19:39.355 --> 01:19:44.355]   The real God that loves us and we need to rejoice in that and as bad as things are gonna get
[01:19:44.355 --> 01:19:56.010]   Understand that that promise is eternal and real And as long as we bring God into our lives, and admit our sins, and ask God to make us reborn to Christ, we can be with Christ forever.
[01:19:56.130 --> 01:19:59.652]  If not, we are going to be cut off, and that's a fate worse than death, obviously.
[01:20:00.112 --> 01:20:03.074]  So Pastor, I want you to finish up with the persecution, and then just big picture.
[01:20:03.514 --> 01:20:07.477]   What a time to rejoice that Revelation is being fulfilled in front of us.
[01:20:07.537 --> 01:20:11.861]  It's just incredible the power of that double-edged sword you were holding up earlier.
[01:20:13.502 --> 01:20:14.704]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[01:20:14.764 --> 01:20:27.936]  So on that night prior, it was a Saturday evening and the judge says, if you go back to your church and preach, we're going to put you in prison an indefinite amount of time until the courts reopen and we can arraign you.
[01:20:28.756 --> 01:20:30.278]  And so I met with my family.
[01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:38.553]  And we had a very emotional time because it was an emotional time because they says, we don't want you to go to jail.
[01:20:38.633 --> 01:20:39.954]  We know that you're going to.
[01:20:40.594 --> 01:20:43.115]  And of course, we did meet that morning.
[01:20:43.175 --> 01:20:46.556]  I told the judge, I said, you give me two hours with our church.
[01:20:47.157 --> 01:20:48.577]  I want one final sermon.
[01:20:48.617 --> 01:20:50.798]  We brought all the Sunday school children in together.
[01:20:50.818 --> 01:20:51.899]  It was a beautiful thing.
[01:20:51.919 --> 01:20:56.821]  27 different nationalities come together and people from all over the city here.
[01:20:57.741 --> 01:21:06.731]   And of course, at the end of that service, While the law enforcement was en route to bring me back into the prison, there was a standoff.
[01:21:06.791 --> 01:21:12.195]  A gunman actually killed one of the policemen and another guy was injured.
[01:21:12.255 --> 01:21:15.677]  Another guy was permanently injured.
[01:21:15.717 --> 01:21:16.338]  Handicapped.
[01:21:16.758 --> 01:21:21.702]  So my attorneys say to the judge and the district attorney, you have real crime to fight.
[01:21:21.762 --> 01:21:22.963]  Leave this pastor alone.
[01:21:23.523 --> 01:21:24.324]  What's happening?
[01:21:25.084 --> 01:21:28.856]   What is happening is We have resistance.
[01:21:29.216 --> 01:21:33.800]  Only he who now letteth will live until he be taken out of the way.
[01:21:34.401 --> 01:21:39.905]  When the church is not hindering as it's supposed to for the past 27 months.
[01:21:40.206 --> 01:21:42.648]  Look at the looting and the murdering and the burning.
[01:21:42.968 --> 01:21:44.089]  Look at the riots.
[01:21:44.209 --> 01:21:45.090]  Look at the crime.
[01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:51.656]  Number five in the nation for murder right here within a 20 mile radius of our church.
[01:21:51.676 --> 01:21:57.966]   For those that know the Bible like you Pastor, hindering means We as a church are to stand against evil and hold it back.
[01:21:59.527 --> 01:22:08.611]  And when we refuse to stand against it and hold it back, look at the onslaught that has come in into our schools and our White House.
[01:22:09.032 --> 01:22:09.852]  Look at what's happened.
[01:22:09.872 --> 01:22:13.094]  They have hijacked Washington Devil's City, D.C.
[01:22:13.554 --> 01:22:16.195]  Here's your scripture, Isaiah 54, 17.
[01:22:16.876 --> 01:22:20.818]  No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper.
[01:22:21.443 --> 01:22:24.045]  The weapon will be formed, but it's not going to prosper.
[01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:29.731]  And every lying tongue that rises up against thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn.
[01:22:30.311 --> 01:22:31.492]  That's our job.
[01:22:31.913 --> 01:22:36.657]  The lies and the slander and the defamatory language, that's our job.
[01:22:36.677 --> 01:22:38.418]  What you're saying is we're waiting on God to do it all.
[01:22:38.498 --> 01:22:40.060]  God has empowered us to do it.
[01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:40.680]  It's our job.
[01:22:41.761 --> 01:22:42.802]  It's our duty.
[01:22:43.123 --> 01:22:44.944]  It's not just our duty and obligation.
[01:22:45.104 --> 01:22:46.586]  It's our right and our privilege.
[01:22:47.202 --> 01:22:50.204]  What would I say to my sons and grandsons?
[01:22:50.524 --> 01:23:06.856]  What would I say to the unborn generations from my loins for them to know that I closed the church at the request, at the orders of a godless governor and a mayor and senator?
[01:23:07.176 --> 01:23:10.338]  What would they say when Daniel went to the Den of Lions?
[01:23:10.799 --> 01:23:17.902]  When Daniel was faced with the decision, it did not take him long to declare he'd rather spend the night with lions than spend one night without prayer.
[01:23:18.383 --> 01:23:23.725]  What would I say on Judgment Day to the three Hebrew boys who refused to bow?
[01:23:23.845 --> 01:23:25.266]  And you know what their king did?
[01:23:25.726 --> 01:23:28.267]  He heated the furnace up seven times hotter.
[01:23:28.488 --> 01:23:29.488]  He turned up the heat.
[01:23:29.868 --> 01:23:39.473]  Well, because of this wind, get ready, because the tyrants are fixing to turn up the heat, because the devil never forgives and he never forgets, and he hates to lose.
[01:23:40.137 --> 01:23:41.661]  So he's got us on his hit list.
[01:23:41.982 --> 01:23:44.869]  That's why you are under such persecution, Alex.
[01:23:45.190 --> 01:23:47.997]  That's why InfoWars is under such persecution.
[01:23:48.345 --> 01:23:52.908]  And it's stifling and it's trying to be quashed.
[01:23:52.928 --> 01:23:53.469]  You know why?
[01:23:53.849 --> 01:23:55.290]  Because you speak the truth.
[01:23:55.690 --> 01:23:58.772]  And where truth is, lies have to run go hide.
[01:23:59.053 --> 01:24:01.174]  And where light is, darkness has to run.
[01:24:01.634 --> 01:24:10.501]  So it's our duty and obligation to fight against evil and tyranny and the satanic forces that are trying to come against the church.
[01:24:11.181 --> 01:24:16.345]  That's why young people are being slaughtered every day in our nation's cities.
[01:24:16.707 --> 01:24:21.831]  That's why abortion is so rampant and gay rights are so rampant.
[01:24:22.151 --> 01:24:22.451]  Why?
[01:24:22.832 --> 01:24:25.734]  Because the church is not doing its job.
[01:24:26.074 --> 01:24:34.160]  But if God said, if my people which are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, we'll hear from heaven.
[01:24:34.721 --> 01:24:44.348]   We need repentance in our land because the blood of 60 million babies In the most safe place in the world, a mother's womb is crying out against us from the ground.
[01:24:44.929 --> 01:24:48.910]  We need repentance in our land while evil.
[01:24:50.490 --> 01:24:52.731]  God give us men like you.
[01:24:53.411 --> 01:24:57.513]  Times like this demand strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and ready hands.
[01:24:57.893 --> 01:24:59.973]  Men whom the lust of office does not kill.
[01:25:00.313 --> 01:25:02.574]  Men whom the spoils of office cannot buy.
[01:25:02.934 --> 01:25:03.854]  Men who have honor.
[01:25:04.155 --> 01:25:05.415]  Men who will not lie.
[01:25:06.267 --> 01:25:10.971]  Men who can stand before a demigod and damn his treacherous flatters without winking.
[01:25:11.271 --> 01:25:15.996]  Tall men, sun-crowned, who live above the fog in godly duty and Christian thinking.
[01:25:16.396 --> 01:25:22.081]  But while the rabble with their thumb-worn creeds, large professions and little deeds, mingle in selfish strife.
[01:25:22.601 --> 01:25:23.382]  Freedom weeps.
[01:25:23.722 --> 01:25:24.883]  Wrong rules the land.
[01:25:25.203 --> 01:25:26.504]  Waiting justice sleeps.
[01:25:26.945 --> 01:25:29.547]  But this word is a sharp two-edged sword.
[01:25:29.907 --> 01:25:32.549]  There's not a governor that can stand against this word.
[01:25:32.810 --> 01:25:33.770]  There's not a mayor.
[01:25:33.970 --> 01:25:35.552]  There's not a crooked policeman.
[01:25:35.852 --> 01:25:37.653]  There's not a senator or congressman.
[01:25:37.673 --> 01:25:44.759]  There's not a president of the United States, even if he is falsely elected, that can stand against this sharp two-edged sword.
[01:25:45.139 --> 01:25:45.620]  You know what?
[01:25:46.340 --> 01:25:49.043]  We've lost faith in all of our government systems.
[01:25:49.503 --> 01:25:51.825]  The Supreme Court here has come through for us.
[01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:58.175]  But it's time for us to put our faith back where it belongs, in God Almighty, in the Word of the Lord.
[01:25:58.435 --> 01:26:02.959]  Because when it comes down to it, this is the only weapon that's going to win at the end of the day.
[01:26:03.259 --> 01:26:04.420]  Make no mistake about it.
[01:26:04.681 --> 01:26:06.242]  Let no man deceive you.
[01:26:06.802 --> 01:26:09.465]  And we are in mass deception right now.
[01:26:09.885 --> 01:26:11.446]  Mass formation psychosis.
[01:26:11.707 --> 01:26:15.570]  And the deception has become the majority in society.
[01:26:16.090 --> 01:26:17.932]  And you and I have become the minority.
[01:26:18.564 --> 01:26:23.009]  You know what Ayn Rand said, whose books are banned in public school libraries?
[01:26:23.569 --> 01:26:29.035]  He said, when you see that in order to produce, that you must gain permission from those who produce nothing.
[01:26:29.588 --> 01:26:35.213]  When you see that money is flowing to those who deal in favors and not in goods.
[01:26:35.834 --> 01:26:42.800]  When you see that men grow richer by graft and by pull, and that your laws do not protect you against them, but protect them against you.
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:49.025]  When you see corruption rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice, then you may know that your society is doomed.
[01:26:49.586 --> 01:26:54.470]  Society may be doomed, but we still can't be fatalists who give up.
[01:26:55.185 --> 01:26:58.566]  We've got to stand up like never before and preach the truth.
[01:26:58.686 --> 01:27:00.507]  That's what you're doing on this program.
[01:27:00.607 --> 01:27:01.827]  That's what we're doing right now.
[01:27:02.127 --> 01:27:04.568]  We're telling the truth and speaking it in love.
[01:27:05.108 --> 01:27:05.608]  You know what?
[01:27:06.049 --> 01:27:16.319]   In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the Bible Belt of America, the right to life and the Louisiana Family Forum, Is calling women who have abortions victims.
[01:27:16.579 --> 01:27:17.620]  They're not victims.
[01:27:18.301 --> 01:27:21.764]  If a child is molested and raped, that child is a victim.
[01:27:22.164 --> 01:27:25.628]  If a woman is physically abused by her husband, she's a victim.
[01:27:26.068 --> 01:27:31.934]  A victim doesn't need to repent, but a woman that kills her baby needs to repent.
[01:27:32.054 --> 01:27:33.195]  She's not a victim.
[01:27:33.735 --> 01:27:35.417]  The child is the victim.
[01:27:36.117 --> 01:27:37.619]  That's what we're facing in America.
[01:27:38.509 --> 01:27:45.091]  And coming from the Supreme Court, that leak, as wrong as it was, they're going to send the power back to the states.
[01:27:46.512 --> 01:27:54.495]  Last Friday, we had a meeting in the state capitol here, and we had a beautiful bill to overturn abortion in our state.
[01:27:54.715 --> 01:27:55.275]  And you know what?
[01:27:56.158 --> 01:27:58.340]  We had three pastors show up, Alex.
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:27:59.481]  Shame on us!
[01:27:59.661 --> 01:28:00.321]  That's the problem.
[01:28:00.381 --> 01:28:02.323]  In closing, Pastor, you've got to come back sooner.
[01:28:02.863 --> 01:28:04.845]  I know that a lot of people are isolated.
[01:28:04.905 --> 01:28:06.886]  A lot of people don't have a good church to go to.
[01:28:07.367 --> 01:28:10.469]  But thank God you put your sermons, many of them, up online.
[01:28:10.949 --> 01:28:12.811]  And I know your church is already huge.
[01:28:12.851 --> 01:28:17.174]  It's exploded under persecution as Christ told us it would and as history shows us.
[01:28:17.615 --> 01:28:23.239]  How do people go and find your great sermons and find that spiritual food they need, Pastor?

[01:28:55.543 --> 01:28:56.003]  Thank you, sir.
[01:28:57.044 --> 01:28:57.705]  God bless you.
[01:28:57.725 --> 01:28:58.806]  God bless the USA.
[01:28:59.926 --> 01:29:00.326]  Powerful.

[01:29:10.297 --> 01:29:11.918]  This ruling is for all of you.
[01:29:11.978 --> 01:29:12.619]  Great job, crew.
[01:29:12.639 --> 01:29:13.340]  All right.
[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:15.162]  The World Government Treaty is here.
[01:29:15.522 --> 01:29:16.543]  The new order's out in the open.
[01:29:16.563 --> 01:29:17.244]  The mask is off.
[01:29:17.504 --> 01:29:18.925]  That's coming up next hour.
[01:29:19.246 --> 01:29:19.786]  Stay with us.
[01:29:19.605 --> 01:29:39.925]  That's hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:29:39.986 --> 01:29:47.170]  All the success that we've had together against the Globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:49.812]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:29:50.532 --> 01:29:57.175]  That's why I want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsTore.com like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration and so much more.

[01:30:31.830 --> 01:30:33.091]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:30:32.971 --> 01:30:53.291]  Please take action.
[01:30:54.068 --> 01:31:01.850]  A database of over 700,000 adverse reactions caused by the Moderna, Pfizer, and Janssen vaccines.
[01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:07.791]  These vaccines have been deployed in different batches, officially referred to as LOTS.
[01:31:08.447 --> 01:31:15.470]  This has allowed Yeadon's team to back-engineer Big Pharma's COVID-19 vaccine deployment agenda in the U.S.
[01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:22.012]  All their information is published at howbadismybatch.com and howbad.info.
[01:31:22.772 --> 01:31:24.533]  And what we learn is quite telling.
[01:31:25.253 --> 01:31:35.677]  About 0.5% of all the different batches are highly toxic, resulting in hospitalization, disability, and death within days or weeks of injection.
[01:31:36.517 --> 01:31:41.704]  Other batches cause minimal adverse reactions and most appear to be harmless placebos.
[01:31:42.586 --> 01:31:52.099]  When plotting on a timeline, we can see that these three companies have been working together to quietly monitor the lethal effectiveness of specific deadly batches.
[01:31:53.240 --> 01:32:06.612]  While one company is deploying a lethal batch, the other two deploy harmless ones, creating the scientific environment to perform dose range finding, or the maximum tolerated dose for each specific batch.
[01:32:07.493 --> 01:32:19.083]  The timeline shows that each lethal batch deployment is preceded and followed by a quiet period, allowing them time to establish their baseline before the next deadly batch is deployed.
[01:32:20.054 --> 01:32:26.937]  Private leaked documents from the CDC show a list of expiry dates and only certain lots are included.
[01:32:27.658 --> 01:32:31.800]  The very same lots found to be highly toxic in part of Cooper's database.
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:33.321]  Which makes sense.
[01:32:33.781 --> 01:32:37.623]  There would be no reason to list expiration dates for saline placebo.
[01:32:38.543 --> 01:32:39.504]  Only the deadly ones.
[01:32:40.689 --> 01:32:49.314]  This mode of deployment allows governments the ability to direct deadly batches into specific populations, such as red states.
[01:32:50.274 --> 01:32:59.820]  Analysis of the number of dying per 100,000 vaccinated in 50 states shows us that the overwhelming majority of vaccine deaths are happening in red states.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:06.023]  Some red states are experiencing 11 times more vaccine deaths than other states.
[01:33:06.904 --> 01:33:12.046]  On average, red states are experiencing twice the amount of vaccine death and injuries than blue states.
[01:33:12.927 --> 01:33:23.473]  After ruling out other possibilities, Parda-Cooper concluded that this can only be due to the fact that red states received at least twice as much of the lethal batches than blue states did.
[01:33:25.316 --> 01:33:36.220]  Among several other crimes, they are tipping the scales of the democratic process by killing people who voted against the New World Order's woke, Build Back Better, Great Reset.
[01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:42.202]  While at the same time, endlessly flooding the borders with unvaccinated foreigners.
[01:33:43.602 --> 01:33:44.963]  And it's happening right now.
[01:33:46.543 --> 01:33:49.103]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reis.
[01:33:49.103 --> 01:34:03.102]  [Music]
[01:34:03.102 --> 01:34:05.102]  Where you have USA...
[01:34:05.441 --> 01:34:15.111]  Senators in both parties saying we may need to go ahead and nuke Russia first, and the Russians are aware that's almost happened before, what do you think that makes the Russians do?
[01:34:15.391 --> 01:34:16.813]  Well, it makes them go into war mode.
[01:34:19.770 --> 01:34:21.271]  So I don't like them invading Ukraine.
[01:34:21.331 --> 01:34:24.712]  I don't like him putting his nuclear forces on maximum alert.
[01:34:25.112 --> 01:34:29.373]  Only one level above that on their DEFCON, just like our system, and that's fire the weapons.
[01:34:30.333 --> 01:34:37.015]   And so now we have Democrats all over the news saying, let's just use Use nuclear weapons on Russia?
[01:34:37.435 --> 01:34:38.776]  Think of their ignorance.
[01:34:39.436 --> 01:34:48.678]  Russia has hundreds of submarines off our coast with sea-launched missiles that would vaporize our cities within five minutes on average of being launched.
[01:34:49.258 --> 01:34:52.799]  Sea-launched cruise missiles that fly at Mach 5.
[01:34:53.139 --> 01:34:58.800]  Land-launched systems they can also launch from ships that are at Mach 9 and cannot be shot down.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:00.981]  And yes, the United States has those too.
[01:35:02.341 --> 01:35:05.502]  That's a Pentagon lie that Russia developed systems that we don't have.
[01:35:06.022 --> 01:35:07.002]  It's on record the U.S.
[01:35:07.042 --> 01:35:08.242]  has those systems.
[01:35:08.262 --> 01:35:13.323]  The point is it's called mutually assured destruction or mad for a reason.
[01:35:14.144 --> 01:35:17.384]  Because anyone that would violate the mad doctrine is insane.
[01:35:18.444 --> 01:35:20.585]  And you know, I'm on the side of not having a nuclear war.
[01:35:21.345 --> 01:35:23.105]  Especially when Russia's not starting a fight with us.
[01:35:23.365 --> 01:35:29.367]  And especially after we just heard for years that everything happening in this country is run by Russia when that was all a giant lie.
[01:35:29.567 --> 01:35:31.267]  The globalists are the outside evil force.
[01:35:33.311 --> 01:35:35.973]  Here we are, kicking off the third hour, Thursday, May 19th, 2022.
[01:35:36.013 --> 01:35:37.054]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:35:41.109 --> 01:35:45.550]  All right, so we've been hammering on this for six months since we knew they were getting it ready.
[01:35:46.350 --> 01:35:48.711]  Thank God the listeners here have gotten the word out.
[01:35:49.371 --> 01:35:52.072]  Really, the credit goes to you, but now it's all over the news.
[01:35:52.912 --> 01:36:02.194]  You've got the UN heads and Bill Gates and the corporate heads and the Democratic Party and the EU bureaucrats saying, we need to have the UN run things.
[01:36:02.274 --> 01:36:03.915]  We need to have the UN control everything.
[01:36:03.955 --> 01:36:04.195]  Why?
[01:36:04.515 --> 01:36:09.236]  Things didn't work well under the pandemic that they released, and so we need to do this.
[01:36:10.777 --> 01:36:32.740]  Everything they're betting on, back when we got documents in 2006, I'll put it in the film, Endgame, 2007, Judicial Watch sued and got them thousands of pages about how they would use the threat of a virus to bring in a world digital ID card and out of that a carbon tax, a social credit score, and a universal basic income after they shut the economy down to make you dependent.
[01:36:33.479 --> 01:36:35.301]  Now that was theoretical back then.
[01:36:35.941 --> 01:36:42.407]  Fast forward to two and a half years ago, they launched the operation, and now we're deep into their attempt to take over.
[01:36:43.227 --> 01:36:47.331]  And here are just stacks of articles and videos today dealing with this.
[01:36:47.991 --> 01:36:51.154]  Australia set to sign Geneva's global pandemic treaty.
[01:36:53.896 --> 01:37:01.082]  But they haven't even released what the treaty is, but they've told us what it is in pieces, and it's bad.
[01:37:02.136 --> 01:37:15.487]  Meanwhile, deaths in New Zealand are rising again and near their record high despite 95% of everyone over 12 in the country having three to four shots and the mask mandate.
[01:37:16.568 --> 01:37:17.769]  Total fraud.
[01:37:19.861 --> 01:37:24.024]  Continuing, why is he reading a script from the World Economic Forum?
[01:37:24.484 --> 01:37:27.326]  There is no science that backs up anything he's saying.
[01:37:27.346 --> 01:37:28.186]  We'll play that clip in a moment.
[01:37:28.746 --> 01:37:32.629]  All lies at N2030 is the only thing that matters.
[01:37:33.609 --> 01:37:41.383]   Health Canada Is to chicken bleep to release their infant statistics on the vaccinated desk this week.
[01:37:42.043 --> 01:37:44.926]  And it goes on from there as they talk about how they're not going to release it.
[01:37:45.266 --> 01:37:49.309]  This is all a test on the sea, how they can kill us.
[01:37:49.789 --> 01:37:56.435]  Marco Rubio asked the question, how do we tell American citizens that if you test positive, you can't enter your own country?
[01:37:56.915 --> 01:38:03.280]  But if you arrive illegally, whether you test positive or not, you say the magic words asylum and you get to stay.
[01:38:04.266 --> 01:38:06.127]  Fauci, I don't have an answer to that.
[01:38:07.368 --> 01:38:11.091]  Fauci says there was never a lockdown in America, but the churches were shut down for over a year.
[01:38:12.765 --> 01:38:15.467]  And it goes on from there.
[01:38:16.127 --> 01:38:17.768]  That's where we are.
[01:38:18.289 --> 01:38:24.773]  And so there's a treaty that they say creates a world ID and creates the power to lock up and force me to inoculate anybody they want.
[01:38:25.473 --> 01:38:30.136]  Harry Truman signed on to the WHO and gave it carte blanche power in 47.
[01:38:30.196 --> 01:38:32.658]  We have to reverse that and say that's wrong.
[01:38:32.718 --> 01:38:34.499]  Same guy gave us the CIA in 47.
[01:38:35.922 --> 01:38:37.023]  But now they're making their move.
[01:38:37.663 --> 01:38:42.927]  So we're already signed on to it, so there doesn't even need to be a ratification, they're saying, to put us under implementation.
[01:38:42.947 --> 01:38:43.547]  But here's the thing.
[01:38:44.188 --> 01:38:48.971]  The CDC said last year they were controlling all rents in America and that they could lock up anybody they wanted.
[01:38:48.991 --> 01:38:50.632]  But the courts, the people said no.
[01:38:50.732 --> 01:38:55.155]  So just because these criminals say something doesn't mean it's gospel.
[01:38:55.196 --> 01:38:58.318]  And that's what's really in the news, is the press releases from last week.
[01:38:58.738 --> 01:39:05.441]   The WHO And the UN are under the command of the World Economic Forum, the Dabos Group, which is the Bilderberg Group.
[01:39:05.781 --> 01:39:13.703]  We have lived to see the Bilderberg Group with a medical scare, with a virus they created, with poison shots, making their move on civilization.
[01:39:13.743 --> 01:39:15.664]  Now, how incredible is that?
[01:39:17.065 --> 01:39:18.145]  Big article breaks this down.
[01:39:18.265 --> 01:39:19.405]  Biden handing over U.S.
[01:39:19.445 --> 01:39:21.586]  sovereignty to the World Health Organization.
[01:39:22.006 --> 01:39:22.526]  Here's another one.
[01:39:22.626 --> 01:39:24.047]  Climate Marshall Plan.
[01:39:25.123 --> 01:39:37.231]  Worldwide lockdowns, shutdown of all fossil fuels, UN joins World Economic Forum, UN joins World Economic Forum, call to end oil, gas, and coal use, period, which would kill billions.
[01:39:37.892 --> 01:39:40.393]  UN chief calls for Climate Marshall Plan.
[01:39:41.334 --> 01:39:45.096]  What did Prince Charles five months ago call for?
[01:39:45.477 --> 01:39:48.619]  A worldwide military operation to end carbon.
[01:39:49.639 --> 01:39:55.142]  We exhale carbon dioxide.
[01:39:57.663 --> 01:39:59.544]  Plants then produce oxygen.
[01:39:59.624 --> 01:40:02.565]  It's the carbon cycle where carbon-based life forms.
[01:40:03.265 --> 01:40:04.226]  Talk about aliens!
[01:40:04.286 --> 01:40:10.629]  I mean, these people are attacking the very life system of the Earth, all that stored up carbon from the ages.
[01:40:11.329 --> 01:40:16.211]  Now that we're terraforming back up into the atmosphere right when carbon dioxide levels were lowered 500 years ago.
[01:40:17.867 --> 01:40:19.508]  It's as if God had it all planned.
[01:40:19.788 --> 01:40:33.874]  Here is Prince Charles I, and we'll get to clip 11, 9, and 5, talking a few months ago about this worldwide military action, with more money than has ever been spent in the world, to transform the planet.
[01:40:33.894 --> 01:40:36.475]  But not to innovate, but to shut off the infrastructure.
[01:40:38.863 --> 01:40:49.947]  So, ladies and gentlemen, my plea today is for countries to come together to create the environment that enables every sector of industry to take the action required.
[01:40:51.467 --> 01:40:55.008]  We know this will take trillions, not billions of dollars.
[01:40:56.129 --> 01:41:05.012]  We also know that countries, many of whom are burdened by growing levels of debt, simply cannot afford to go green.
[01:41:06.877 --> 01:41:12.600]  Here we need a vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector.
[01:41:13.700 --> 01:41:30.608]  With trillions at his disposal, far beyond global GDP, and, with the greatest respect, beyond even the governments of the world's leaders, it offers the only real prospect of achieving fundamental economic transition.
[01:41:33.581 --> 01:41:41.294]  It's all about massive depopulation, all about central banks controlling the free market to bankrupt you for a social credit score.
[01:41:41.315 --> 01:41:43.238]  Now that's Charles months ago.
[01:41:43.719 --> 01:42:10.118]  Here is Charles currently yesterday.
[01:42:10.118 --> 01:42:14.557]   So what he's saying is, it comes out of the jungles because you're bad.
[01:42:14.913 --> 01:42:17.154]  No, it comes out of Wuhan, you cooked it up with Bill Gates.
[01:42:18.035 --> 01:42:25.198]  So, let us kill you, let us cut your energy off, let us depopulate, or we're going to release more viruses.
[01:42:26.138 --> 01:42:33.522]  Now here is Ted Rose, the head of the WHO, literally paid off by Gates, saying he trusts Bill Gates and Bill Gates is running things.
[01:42:33.802 --> 01:42:34.182]  Here it is.
[01:42:35.986 --> 01:42:51.019]  I have known Bill and Melinda for many, many years now and have been working with them very closely, not as a DG, but when I was in Ethiopia working in the Ministry of Health and later on.
[01:42:54.362 --> 01:42:58.966]  Their commitment, I mean these two human beings, it's amazing.
[01:43:01.388 --> 01:43:10.813]  You know, having people like Bill and Melinda with big heart to support humanity, it's something we should cherish.
[01:43:13.634 --> 01:43:25.340]  I have seen them in action and I have seen their, the outcome of all they have been trying to do.
[01:43:27.376 --> 01:43:29.217]  And you know what I always say?
[01:43:29.717 --> 01:43:31.458]  If we can have more people like them.
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:40.142]  People who really, genuinely support.
[01:43:41.242 --> 01:43:47.845]  People who have that big heart and bring humanity before anything.
[01:43:49.726 --> 01:43:51.287]  So that's what I would like to assure you.
[01:43:52.421 --> 01:43:53.962]  I can't listen.
[01:43:53.983 --> 01:43:56.104]  He goes on to say he trusts him and Bill Gates for everything.
[01:43:56.725 --> 01:43:57.646]  The clip's on in full force.
[01:43:57.686 --> 01:43:58.587]  I can't listen to any more of it.
[01:43:59.347 --> 01:44:01.469]  Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate you.
[01:44:01.509 --> 01:44:02.770]  Bill Gates pays no taxes.
[01:44:03.171 --> 01:44:04.672]  Bill Gates has everything tax exempt.
[01:44:04.692 --> 01:44:05.513]  Bill Gates is a criminal.
[01:44:08.335 --> 01:44:14.000]  Who's a censor, an anti-American, a pro-communist China, and we're being told he should run our lives.
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:15.381]  That's what Tedros goes on to say.
[01:44:15.401 --> 01:44:16.662]  I just can't listen to any more of it.
[01:44:17.203 --> 01:44:18.144]  Here's the Bank of England.
[01:44:20.236 --> 01:44:21.257]  Well, we don't have time for it.
[01:44:21.277 --> 01:44:21.977]  I'll play it when we come back.
[01:44:22.758 --> 01:44:24.999]  Admitting... What's the term they use?
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:36.446]  Bank of England chief warns over, quote, apocalyptic food prices because of the lockdowns.
[01:44:37.227 --> 01:44:38.487]  So they trigger all this.
[01:44:38.828 --> 01:44:49.651]   They're going to flood the first world, the refugees, and then pose as a savior and talk about the big heart He also talked about the big heart of Bono that raises billions off Helping Africa and gives 1%.
[01:44:49.691 --> 01:44:49.651]  1.1%.
[01:44:50.271 --> 01:45:03.941]  It's a disgusting scum, like the most sociopathic, psychotic people on earth, and they're just up there betting on us being ignorant, betting on us not being aware of who they are.
[01:45:04.801 --> 01:45:07.283]  Well, we're awake, Tedros, so look out.
[01:45:07.623 --> 01:45:08.344]  You too, Bill Gates.
[01:45:08.684 --> 01:45:09.244]  We'll be right back.
[01:45:09.264 --> 01:45:09.645]  Stay with us.
[01:45:14.352 --> 01:45:21.834]  The year is 1995, and InfoWars launches the last of America's counter-globalist probes.
[01:45:22.334 --> 01:45:36.459]  In a freak mishap, InfoWars.com and Alex Jones are blown out of their trajectory into an orbit which freezes his life support systems, and returns Alex Jones to Earth 25 years later.
[01:45:36.879 --> 01:45:40.340]  Trans-dimensionally, over the space-time continuum through full space-time.
[01:45:40.700 --> 01:45:44.801]  Where people are extremely lazy, the social engineers are there laughing.
[01:45:45.041 --> 01:45:49.043]  What we envisioned a hundred years ago, twenty years ago, is now reality.
[01:45:49.823 --> 01:46:05.948]  While the society unravels, men run around totally frantic, not knowing how to be men, and women run around frantic, not knowing how to be women, and they don't understand that it's an animating contest of life, and that it's fulfilling to be informed, it's fulfilling to be involved, it's fulfilling.
[01:46:06.128 --> 01:46:06.868]  InfoWars.
[01:46:07.248 --> 01:46:08.129]  Tomorrow's News.
[01:46:08.429 --> 01:46:08.729]  Today.
[01:46:09.932 --> 01:46:15.775]  And then, I'm afraid the one that I'm going to sound, I guess, rather apocalyptic about is food.
[01:46:17.736 --> 01:46:25.319]  So when I was in Washington at the IMF World Bank Spring Meetings a month or so ago, and we had the Ukrainian finance minister there.
[01:46:25.459 --> 01:46:27.240]  I did spend most of my time in meetings.
[01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:29.181]  People think I spent most of my time walking out of meetings.
[01:46:29.221 --> 01:46:33.303]  I didn't actually, but only when the Russian finance minister came on.
[01:46:33.363 --> 01:46:41.886]   But I have to tell you that, I mean, I think this is a big concern because I think two things that the Ukrainian finance minister said.
[01:46:41.986 --> 01:46:47.209]  One is, Ukraine does have food in store, but it can't get it out at the moment.
[01:46:47.890 --> 01:47:01.199]  Two, while he was optimistic about crop planting, as you know Ukraine is a major supplier of wheat, a major supplier of oil, of cooking oils.
[01:47:02.259 --> 01:47:08.764]  He said, he was pretty optimistic about planting, interestingly, but he said at the moment we have no way of shipping it out.
[01:47:09.564 --> 01:47:10.125]  Apocalyptic.
[01:47:09.945 --> 01:47:11.945]  I think Stan's moment is getting worse.
[01:47:11.945 --> 01:47:13.945]  And that is a major, major worry.
[01:47:13.945 --> 01:47:15.945]   And it's not just, I have to tell you, a major worry for this country,
[01:47:15.945 --> 01:47:18.945]  it is a major worry for the developing world as well.
[01:47:18.945 --> 01:47:22.945]   And so if I had to sort of, sorry for being apocalyptic for a moment,
[01:47:22.945 --> 01:47:25.945]  but that is a, that's a major concern.
[01:47:25.945 --> 01:47:28.945]  Apocalyptic.
[01:47:28.945 --> 01:47:33.945]  Apocalyptic, says the head of the Bank of England.
[01:47:33.945 --> 01:47:36.945]  But did you hear that the lockdowns caused it?
[01:47:37.554 --> 01:47:42.698]  Oh no, it's Russia, it's Ukraine, and that's just a cherry on top.
[01:47:44.679 --> 01:47:51.584]  And Australia and other countries say, we're going to sign on to this UN treaty, but they won't even release the treaty, but they tell us what the treaty is.
[01:47:52.885 --> 01:47:57.168]  And it's a worldwide corporate technocracy.
[01:47:58.449 --> 01:48:04.273]  And that's what we're discussing here on this Thursday, May 19th broadcast.
[01:48:06.109 --> 01:48:07.249]  I'm going to hit more news now.
[01:48:08.350 --> 01:48:31.938]  There's a lot of it to get to, but I just want to illustrate that what we're dealing with here are individuals and groups that are fundamentally hateful and that are fundamentally ruthless and who at a base level hate everybody, including their own families.
[01:48:33.894 --> 01:48:47.684]  And that's why they tell you all day, America is racist and bad, is because the idea of America, which was never fully implemented, but partially implemented, was so great compared to every other system that they can't deal with it.
[01:48:47.704 --> 01:48:48.645]  They can't compete with it.
[01:48:48.685 --> 01:48:54.609]  They don't know how to respond to a system where, hey, I'm confident in myself.
[01:48:55.939 --> 01:49:12.443]  I'm confident in my abilities, and I think if you're competent, and you're smart, and you build a great business, or a great invention, or make great food, or a great farmer, or a great teacher, or a great artist, a great pastor, a great leader, that your wealth increases my wealth.
[01:49:12.483 --> 01:49:14.043]  I mean, I know that's how wealth works.
[01:49:14.444 --> 01:49:15.284]  Everybody knows that.
[01:49:16.724 --> 01:49:20.605]  So why are they setting up a system where they cut off the carbon and cut off the wealth?
[01:49:21.965 --> 01:49:23.926]  It's because they can't compete with you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:25.256 --> 01:49:29.699]  Pastor Spell last hour read an Ayn Rand quote that was really powerful that I remember reading many years ago.
[01:49:29.719 --> 01:49:30.420]  I hadn't read since.
[01:49:34.283 --> 01:49:39.006]  That we should probably try to find later and play a clip of on air because I can't quote the whole thing just from memory.
[01:49:41.988 --> 01:49:54.415]   But when those that don't produce are pointing their finger at people that do produce, and trying to guilt us into submission to them, you know
[01:49:54.415 --> 01:49:56.895]  you're in a very bad situation.
[01:49:56.895 --> 01:50:03.855]   And that's really what we do here, is we raise the alarm and we try to convince people
[01:50:03.855 --> 01:50:08.975]   from a historic and economic and cultural and religious spiritual perspective
[01:50:08.975 --> 01:50:14.815]  that the only thing you can lose at is not taking action.
[01:50:14.968 --> 01:50:18.389]  The only way you lose is not by being engaged.
[01:50:18.409 --> 01:50:23.411]  Now you can reverse that and say, well, the 1983 movie War Games, what a strange game.
[01:50:24.691 --> 01:50:25.571]  What a strange game.
[01:50:26.192 --> 01:50:28.352]  The only way to win is not to play.
[01:50:28.472 --> 01:50:29.373]  Yes, exactly.
[01:50:29.833 --> 01:50:31.233]  We shouldn't play in the violence.
[01:50:32.433 --> 01:50:33.754]  We shouldn't play in the riots.
[01:50:35.834 --> 01:50:43.717]   But we should be fully, totally, Absolutely engaged.
[01:50:46.218 --> 01:50:46.939]  Every day.
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:50.601]  Challenging the lies of the corporate media.
[01:50:50.861 --> 01:50:53.062]  And the good news is we've kicked their butts.
[01:50:54.363 --> 01:50:56.544]  The good news is they're dead politically.
[01:50:57.044 --> 01:50:58.205]  No one's buying what they're doing.
[01:50:58.325 --> 01:51:00.086]  But they're still in control.
[01:51:00.146 --> 01:51:06.109]  So what do you do if you're in control of the finances and the infrastructure but everybody hates you?
[01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:07.410]  Do you give up?
[01:51:07.430 --> 01:51:08.171]  Do you go away?
[01:51:08.191 --> 01:51:09.231]  Do you reform yourself?
[01:51:09.271 --> 01:51:10.252]  Well that's the smart thing to do.
[01:51:11.288 --> 01:51:11.988]  You become a human.
[01:51:12.969 --> 01:51:13.189]  No.
[01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.670]  They don't do that.
[01:51:17.131 --> 01:51:21.353]  They double and triple and quadruple and quintuple down, and then they do it again.
[01:51:22.894 --> 01:51:26.556]  And so, that's why we're in such a dangerous position.
[01:51:26.616 --> 01:51:32.219]  I'm just going to say this now to the listeners, and I really mean this from my fundamental core.
[01:51:33.542 --> 01:51:37.123]  I know the power of the individual reaching out and working with other individuals.
[01:51:37.143 --> 01:51:41.664]  Because all of our great successes has been a collective success with all of you.
[01:51:43.245 --> 01:51:48.426]  But beautiful souls, individuals, working together for that change.
[01:51:48.906 --> 01:51:49.906]  That is what you did.
[01:51:50.086 --> 01:51:54.368]  And I never know if it's my last broadcast with the things that are going on in this country and the world.
[01:51:54.568 --> 01:51:55.468]  I think you understand that.
[01:51:57.668 --> 01:51:59.309]  And that's why I want to take time out again.
[01:52:00.373 --> 01:52:02.854]  With all the news and all the clips and all the things I'm about to cover.
[01:52:03.294 --> 01:52:04.494]  I've only covered like a third of the news.
[01:52:05.375 --> 01:52:07.015]  I don't say this because I'm lacking time.
[01:52:10.257 --> 01:52:11.197]  Or I got too much time.
[01:52:12.797 --> 01:52:13.958]  I say it because it's so real.
[01:52:15.518 --> 01:52:16.579]  You know who you are.
[01:52:17.639 --> 01:52:19.099]  That have spoke up for InfoWars.
[01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:22.060]  You know who you are that have prayed for this operation.
[01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:26.442]  You know who you are that have bought products and made donations.
[01:52:27.122 --> 01:52:33.944]  And I want to thank those of you that have done that, particularly in the last month, as I gave it to God.
[01:52:35.244 --> 01:52:39.085]  And I said, God, I can't keep buying products in the future to fund our operation.
[01:52:39.125 --> 01:52:45.007]  Do I just spend the money we got, tell the audience we're going to shut down in 9, 10 months, 12 months maximum.
[01:52:46.545 --> 01:52:50.648]  And do I just let people know we've run our course, but I don't believe we've run our course.
[01:52:51.469 --> 01:53:09.762]  And I just had amazing internal confidence at my core that God does not want this fight to stop and God does not want InfoWars to be a relic of the past, though what we've said and done is going to be powerful in the future.
[01:53:10.714 --> 01:53:18.580]  But God has our most important work to happen currently, in the present, and into the future, and in the past.
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:24.885]  Because without a Band-Odd video, they will flush all the previous shows we predicted everything on.
[01:53:25.185 --> 01:53:26.727]  That has such an awakening effect.
[01:53:27.427 --> 01:53:33.712]  And so, it's our past work now, being presented in the current and the future, that is really the most important.
[01:53:34.233 --> 01:53:42.819]   And it is all of you, and your support, To pay for the hundreds of thousands of dollars of bandwidth a month that have allowed this new Great Awakening to happen.
[01:53:43.279 --> 01:53:44.700]  And so you can look in the mirror tonight.
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:46.241]  You can look in the mirror right now.
[01:53:47.081 --> 01:53:50.622]  And just know that you did amazing things.
[01:53:51.143 --> 01:53:54.904]  And I believe our greatest days have just begun.
[01:53:54.964 --> 01:53:55.364]  Stay with us.
[01:53:56.705 --> 01:53:57.765]  Back at the moon.
[01:54:00.286 --> 01:54:01.007]  Yeah!
[01:54:03.368 --> 01:54:04.188]  Back at the moon.
[01:54:08.939 --> 01:54:11.021]  All right, my friends, let's continue on with the news.
[01:54:12.742 --> 01:54:13.262]  All right.
[01:54:13.502 --> 01:54:19.627]  Look, I've got to get through all these clips because I was watching these last night and this morning, and they've just got to be seen.
[01:54:20.228 --> 01:54:21.449]  And I've got two clips.
[01:54:21.649 --> 01:54:23.390]  TV viewers will be able to see these radio listeners.
[01:54:23.410 --> 01:54:32.317]  I'll describe them for you that are also on Infowars.com that are just just so illustrative.
[01:54:34.429 --> 01:54:37.450]  And documentary of everything we're talking about.
[01:54:38.130 --> 01:54:45.232]  Obviously China under Rockefeller, Bill Gates, Carnegie, CIA control, 26-7 months ago did the big fair mongering.
[01:54:45.812 --> 01:54:52.073]  All the theater, the people being welded in their houses, people being taken to camps, to set the precedent of this is how you respond.
[01:54:52.113 --> 01:54:55.654]  And now the UN treaty is coming in that codifies that into world law.
[01:55:00.035 --> 01:55:01.575]  But we got new clips.
[01:55:01.595 --> 01:55:02.716]  This is on the Chinese news.
[01:55:02.736 --> 01:55:03.656]  They're very proud of this.
[01:55:07.083 --> 01:55:23.886]  Of 18-wheeler-sized fire trucks, we'll roll the B-roll now, driving down the streets in major cities, spraying disinfectant on the streets in the middle of high noon.
[01:55:26.327 --> 01:55:28.047]  Now, why is that so important?
[01:55:29.107 --> 01:55:34.328]  Well, any virus, particularly coronavirus, is very weak, dies in about three seconds in direct sunlight.
[01:55:35.808 --> 01:55:39.730]  Indoors, in water droplets, it can live about two minutes.
[01:55:39.851 --> 01:55:40.851]  You look those studies up.
[01:55:41.251 --> 01:56:00.263]  It is a known fact that within two to three seconds of sunlight, the COVID-19 virus and all its variants, like vampires at high noon, are fried.
[01:56:03.322 --> 01:56:06.164]  Just like you lay out the sun for 30 minutes, when you add a tan, you get burned.
[01:56:06.644 --> 01:56:08.426]  It kills them in seconds.
[01:56:09.527 --> 01:56:19.154]  They have locked down cities, 40 million people in just one city alone, 30 million in another, 400 million total, and they've got giant...
[01:56:20.945 --> 01:56:25.269]  Bus-sized fire trucks driving around spraying the street.
[01:56:25.650 --> 01:56:34.678]  And they have people that go down the street and spray disinfectant in the air, all theater, while everyone is locked up inside their giant coffin apartments.
[01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:37.250]  Now some people for six weeks.
[01:56:38.111 --> 01:56:46.636]  Mass suicide, death, a giant exercise in martial law, and people that have been welded in and stockaded in to these gulags.
[01:56:47.036 --> 01:56:56.942]  Here's an image, video, of people with rope ladders escaping to get food after almost six weeks inside the buildings.
[01:56:58.023 --> 01:57:10.374]   While the government drives around and people in bunny suits Spraying disinfectant on the streets as if there's a virus there.
[01:57:10.874 --> 01:57:13.774]  All for show, all an exercise of insanity.
[01:57:13.794 --> 01:57:17.195]  And then we have the numbers I covered earlier.
[01:57:19.936 --> 01:57:28.838]  New Zealand, Israel, all the highest vaccinated places have the highest rates of death, illness, hospitalization, you name it.
[01:57:30.928 --> 01:57:33.830]  We know exactly what's going on.
[01:57:35.592 --> 01:57:41.256]  And so you've got to ask yourself, with the behavioral psychology, what is the point of that?
[01:57:42.357 --> 01:57:51.244]  With fire trucks driving around, spraying soap disinfectant on the roads while everyone's locked down, there's not a person on the street.
[01:57:55.267 --> 01:57:56.208]  It's mass insanity.
[01:57:58.209 --> 01:57:58.830]  It's communism.
[01:58:02.688 --> 01:58:04.369]  It's a giant open-air lunatic asylum.
[01:58:07.972 --> 01:58:15.257]  What is the communist Chinese dictator getting their population ready for?
[01:58:15.597 --> 01:58:22.522]  Why do they have giant robot drones flying around spraying chemicals into the air?
[01:58:26.525 --> 01:58:28.146]  You want an image of dystopia?
[01:58:29.908 --> 01:58:31.509]  You want an image of what's coming here?
[01:58:34.269 --> 01:58:36.210]  China is hallmarking itself.
[01:58:36.810 --> 01:58:45.355]  China is signaling to the WEF, the Davos group, that they are ready to implement the total tyranny now.
[01:58:48.756 --> 01:58:55.039]  The images of them hog-tying people with electrical tape and taking them away because they're not submitting.
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:59.122]  All to the social credit score because they didn't behave themselves.
[01:58:59.582 --> 01:59:03.864]  How would the Chinese government roll out and arrest and kill millions of its opposition?
[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:09.001]  Well, the uniform is the white lab coat.
[01:59:09.401 --> 01:59:10.641]  It is the white bunny suit.
[01:59:11.522 --> 01:59:12.842]  And the mask covering the face.
[01:59:13.162 --> 01:59:27.268]  Whether you're stealing an election of 2,000 mules, or whether you're taking somebody to a death camp where their organs will be harvested, it's all being done as an exercise to see, will the population go along with their own extermination?
[01:59:29.028 --> 01:59:29.809]  And that's where we are.
[01:59:33.250 --> 01:59:44.459]   And you have to understand, the whole blueprint was co-written By the Deimos Group, by Bill Gates, by the CIA, Carnegie Endowment, look it up, by the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:53.062]  And you gotta ask yourself, where is this gonna end?
[01:59:55.503 --> 01:59:56.524]  How is this gonna end?
[01:59:58.404 --> 02:00:02.186]  And the answer is, in sheer madness.
[02:00:04.787 --> 02:00:21.351]  As the communist Chinese prepare to invade and take over Taiwan, as they've already taken over Hong Kong, and as they become an example to the world of how to live under this abject tyranny.
[02:00:23.552 --> 02:00:36.116]   So when Prince Charles says we need a global military operation, a global Marshall Plan, the biggest thing in the world, to save the earth from carbon, Well, have you looked at yourself?
[02:00:36.717 --> 02:00:38.559]  Have you gone and looked up what you're made up out of?
[02:00:41.903 --> 02:00:42.804]  You're made out of carbon.
[02:00:44.866 --> 02:00:45.667]  You are carbon.
[02:00:49.571 --> 02:00:50.011]  And war...
[02:00:51.314 --> 02:01:10.101]  Biomedical world government depopulation tyranny has been declared on you, and if you ever wondered, if you hadn't seen the film Endgame or hadn't researched what we've covered, if you ever wondered how they'd do it, how they'd roll out a world ID, how they'd roll out disappearing people to camps, how they'd roll out robots flying around the sky and spraying chemicals everywhere, how would they do it?
[02:01:10.421 --> 02:01:13.542]  And you now know how they do it, and what did Prince Charles say?
[02:01:13.562 --> 02:01:15.163]  I played the clip at the start of the hour.
[02:01:16.681 --> 02:01:20.484]  If you don't give in to world government, more viruses will come out of the jungle and kill you.
[02:01:20.764 --> 02:01:25.749]  He's saying, submit to us, let us lock you down, and then the viruses won't kill you anymore.
[02:01:25.989 --> 02:01:33.795]  But we know that this was a beta test, and that once we allow them to lock everything down, they are going to drop the proverbial hammer on our heads.
[02:01:37.899 --> 02:01:49.520]   When we come back, the latest in Ukraine, the latest on Biden and what he has planned for the midterms, the latest on Governor DeSantis, And so much more.
[02:01:50.781 --> 02:01:55.584]  And then we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson from England hosting the fourth hour today.
[02:01:56.345 --> 02:02:03.770]  And then at three o'clock central time in an hour and 17 and a half minutes, Owen Schroyer will take over the war room.
[02:02:03.810 --> 02:02:05.391]  And every day we're on air is precious.
[02:02:06.092 --> 02:02:07.833]  Every day we're able to tell the truth is precious.
[02:02:07.973 --> 02:02:13.637]  Every day you send new people here to find out what's really happening, to understand the big endgame is precious.
[02:02:13.657 --> 02:02:25.484]   And that's why I'm very honored I'm blessed to be here with you and very thankful to all of you because our job is going to become very easy because it's about to all get right out in the open.
[02:02:26.745 --> 02:02:28.966]  This gas is going up even more.
[02:02:28.986 --> 02:02:35.731]  I mean it's, I think it's going to be, I mean I'm seeing it like close to $5 even in some parts of Florida.
[02:02:36.191 --> 02:02:41.194]  It was probably about $4.15 just a couple weeks ago, so it's going up.
[02:02:42.615 --> 02:02:45.338]  You know, they're not doing energy in the United States.
[02:02:45.398 --> 02:02:54.468]  Now they say they want to get oil from Maduro in Venezuela, which all that's going to do is just line his pockets, and actually it'll help Russia.
[02:02:54.688 --> 02:02:57.131]  They're always talking about Russia and Putin.
[02:02:57.431 --> 02:03:02.076]  Well, they have a very close relationship with Maduro and Putin, and so they're doing that.
[02:03:02.115 --> 02:03:07.115]   will vet OPEC, but they will not do more energy in the United States.
[02:03:07.115 --> 02:03:13.315]   And the result is that they've really reduced our ability to be energy independent and produce
[02:03:13.315 --> 02:03:14.315]  our own energy.
[02:03:14.315 --> 02:03:19.115]  They're canceling oil and gas leases in places like Alaska.
[02:03:19.115 --> 02:03:23.795]   And the people who have to fill up their gas tanks are the ones that are paying the price
[02:03:23.795 --> 02:03:25.235]  for those bad policies.
[02:03:25.272 --> 02:03:35.958]  And so, I think what Elon Musk said the other day about, you know, whoever puts that stuff into the teleprompter is kind of who the president is, because you just never know.
[02:03:36.138 --> 02:03:37.758]  But this is a huge failure.
[02:03:37.958 --> 02:03:40.160]  And it's really difficult for a lot of people.
[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:43.281]  And we have not even hit summer driving season yet.
[02:03:43.301 --> 02:03:50.425]   So I think you're going to see it, you know, unless they reverse course, You're going to see it over $5 a gallon for unleaded.
[02:03:50.805 --> 02:03:55.709]  And in places like California, it'll probably be like $7 or $8 because of all those taxes they have.
[02:03:56.970 --> 02:03:59.932]  So you caught the problem with what DeSantis said, right?
[02:03:59.952 --> 02:04:01.012]  And he's a good guy, I like him.
[02:04:01.813 --> 02:04:02.934]  Oh, it's bad policy.
[02:04:02.954 --> 02:04:03.834]  They don't know what they're doing.
[02:04:06.156 --> 02:04:12.160]  It's being reported that they're programming Oregon gas pumps at $10 a gallon now.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:12.840]  That's in the news.
[02:04:13.841 --> 02:04:14.822]  So they're getting you ready for that.
[02:04:16.658 --> 02:04:24.753]  Now something that Sanders said that was totally true was that Biden should get an honorary membership in the drug cartels for what he's done on the southern border.
[02:04:24.774 --> 02:04:25.114]  Here it is.
[02:04:25.867 --> 02:04:30.166]   Border communities are just getting killed down in Southern Texas, you know, with everything
[02:04:30.166 --> 02:04:31.166]  coming in.
[02:04:31.166 --> 02:04:36.367]   And, you know, honestly, he should be, Biden should be given an honorary membership in
[02:04:36.367 --> 02:04:42.426]   the Mexican drug cartels because nobody has done more to help the cartels than Biden with
[02:04:42.426 --> 02:04:44.086]  his open border policies.
[02:04:44.086 --> 02:04:47.046]  And so so it's a total disaster.
[02:04:47.046 --> 02:04:50.146]  It's been a disaster, I fear, with Title 42.
[02:04:50.146 --> 02:04:55.987]   If they do repeal it, I think things are fixing to get even worse.
[02:04:55.987 --> 02:04:58.827]  But it's a disaster that was planned.
[02:04:58.765 --> 02:05:04.552]  And every senator and House member that's decent, like DeSantis, keeps saying, oh, they're idiots.
[02:05:04.632 --> 02:05:12.461]  The left doesn't know what they're... No, this is an exact plan to collapse the third world, flood the first world, ship in all the fentanyl.
[02:05:12.721 --> 02:05:16.986]  All of this is a formula of George Soros and the New World Order.
[02:05:19.605 --> 02:05:29.429]  So I want to commend all the listeners, and you know who you are, that have supported us and donated and bought products at InfoWareStore.com, because we're toe-to-toe with Soros.
[02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:31.570]  We're toe-to-toe with the New World Order.
[02:05:32.250 --> 02:05:33.370]  Most people are scared to do it.
[02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:35.531]  I'm scared to not fight it, because I realize what they're taking us.
[02:05:36.491 --> 02:05:37.932]  And because of you, we're still on air.
[02:05:38.312 --> 02:05:40.333]  So you know who you are, those that have been donating.
[02:05:40.833 --> 02:05:45.675]  I want to thank you so much for what you've done, because I have a great crew.
[02:05:47.372 --> 02:05:53.296]  And we're doing a lot of research, a lot of ways to fund things around here, and a lot of ways to cut costs.
[02:05:54.337 --> 02:05:55.578]  And nobody told me.
[02:05:59.140 --> 02:06:02.362]  We were three months behind on our bandwidth bills because the money wasn't there.
[02:06:03.783 --> 02:06:04.464]  And I said, well.
[02:06:06.704 --> 02:06:08.525]  We have that Bitcoin somebody gave us.
[02:06:09.226 --> 02:06:10.286]  We already cashed half of it.
[02:06:10.326 --> 02:06:12.388]  I was trying to wait till it went back up, but that will pay the bill.
[02:06:13.128 --> 02:06:17.811]  And I was like, tell me, because I don't want to be on payment plans with the people supporting me.
[02:06:17.831 --> 02:06:20.453]  That's how close down the line we were.
[02:06:20.513 --> 02:06:24.096]  But your donations and your support and what you've done has kept us on air.
[02:06:24.136 --> 02:06:24.736]  So I thank you.
[02:06:25.196 --> 02:06:26.757]  Now, a lot of people sent me this.
[02:06:26.877 --> 02:06:28.959]  It was trending, I guess, two days ago on Twitter.
[02:06:29.019 --> 02:06:29.699]  I didn't see that.
[02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:31.541]  I got sent screenshots of it.
[02:06:32.001 --> 02:06:32.901]  But Alex Jones was right.
[02:06:32.922 --> 02:06:33.662]  It was trending again.
[02:06:33.702 --> 02:06:35.163]  They were skywriting it over L.A.
[02:06:35.183 --> 02:06:35.924]  with five airplanes.
[02:06:35.944 --> 02:06:36.424]  It was amazing.
[02:06:37.284 --> 02:06:40.585]  But what was trending was this big study.
[02:06:42.746 --> 02:06:49.527]  They got studies in the U.S., they got studies in Africa, they got studies in Asia, they got studies in Latin America, Central, South America.
[02:06:51.028 --> 02:06:57.249]  That just a little bit of atrazine creates total feminization of male frogs.
[02:06:57.369 --> 02:07:03.011]  And then they're attracted to the same sex, and the media makes jokes, oh well gay frogs are cute, why are you against them?
[02:07:06.488 --> 02:07:07.429]  It's because they die.
[02:07:07.729 --> 02:07:08.570]  They go extinct.
[02:07:11.373 --> 02:07:14.295]  I guess the left's gonna tell us there's too many frogs now because they're carbon-based?
[02:07:15.336 --> 02:07:17.778]  So the frogs are a canary in the coal mine.
[02:07:18.419 --> 02:07:20.981]  The frogs are a canary in the coal mine.
[02:07:21.362 --> 02:07:24.044]  They are a example of where we are.
[02:07:24.104 --> 02:07:24.785]  Here's a big study.
[02:07:26.346 --> 02:07:32.172]  Atrazine induces complete feminization and chemical castration in male African clawed frogs.
[02:07:34.375 --> 02:07:36.657]  And again, these studies have been out for a while.
[02:07:36.697 --> 02:07:37.837]  There's new studies out on it.
[02:07:38.918 --> 02:07:42.020]  And it shows what it does.
[02:07:42.060 --> 02:07:43.261]  We got Berkeley studies.
[02:07:44.121 --> 02:07:45.882]  We got studies out of Toronto.
[02:07:46.743 --> 02:07:48.404]  We got studies out of South Africa.
[02:07:49.825 --> 02:07:51.226]  We've got it all, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:52.367 --> 02:07:54.568]  And it does this to humans as well.
[02:07:55.269 --> 02:08:00.972]  That's why genitals, I don't care if you're black or white, are a third the size they were of a 1960s male.
[02:08:03.843 --> 02:08:10.625]  So the media makes jokes about that a few months ago when I gave the example of, you know, if your daddy's Johnson was a foot long, yours is six inches long.
[02:08:11.025 --> 02:08:13.885]  And if yours was six inches, your son will be three inches.
[02:08:14.206 --> 02:08:15.486]  And the one with that won't even have a penis.
[02:08:16.446 --> 02:08:21.827]  So you make jokes about that all day long, but... This isn't a game.
[02:08:23.828 --> 02:08:25.388]  And you can say, okay, well, who cares?
[02:08:26.048 --> 02:08:27.449]  Well, we're sterilized.
[02:08:27.829 --> 02:08:30.689]  And the sperm counts are down 96% in North America.
[02:08:33.567 --> 02:08:38.768]  I think God designed us with millions of sperm each time, so there's still some get in there.
[02:08:39.809 --> 02:08:45.310]  But you wonder about the autism and the cancer rates and all of it, that's what's going on here.
[02:08:45.370 --> 02:08:58.494]  And they had all these other chemicals they could put in the fuel, but they choose atrazine because it specifically causes complete feminization and chemical castration in male African clawed frogs and other frogs.
[02:09:00.413 --> 02:09:00.973]  And why is that?
[02:09:00.993 --> 02:09:02.114]  Well the frogs live in the water.
[02:09:02.174 --> 02:09:03.934]  The frogs have thin skin.
[02:09:04.334 --> 02:09:05.375]  It gets into their bloodstream.
[02:09:06.335 --> 02:09:16.198]  But it does the same thing to different degrees to every single species that this happens to.
[02:09:17.418 --> 02:09:24.020]  And so we've had all the late night comedy shows from Colbert to Fallon to Kimmel.
[02:09:25.721 --> 02:09:26.421]  You've seen the clips.
[02:09:27.261 --> 02:09:28.662]  Say Alex Jones is really dangerous.
[02:09:28.702 --> 02:09:43.699]   He claims there's chemicals In the Food and Water, he claims there's liner in the soft drink cans that has bisphenol A and other chemicals in it that lower fertility, but that's what the studies show.
[02:09:43.759 --> 02:09:52.606]  Type into a search engine, plastic liners in food containers causing lower sperm counts, causing hormonal disturbances.
[02:09:53.006 --> 02:09:55.188]  Girls on average used to go into puberty at 13.
[02:09:55.228 --> 02:09:57.550]  The U.S.
[02:09:57.590 --> 02:09:58.610]  national average is about 9.
[02:10:00.725 --> 02:10:03.347]  Three-year-old girls are now having periods.
[02:10:03.647 --> 02:10:05.668]  Five-year-old girls are now getting pregnant.
[02:10:06.869 --> 02:10:14.734]  Because these chemicals hyper-feminize females and feminize males.
[02:10:14.954 --> 02:10:21.858]  And this is one of the big central issues that we're talking about.
[02:10:22.338 --> 02:10:32.991]   So, out of one side of their mouth, They're telling you it doesn't exist.
[02:10:33.031 --> 02:10:34.051]  Don't look into it.
[02:10:35.112 --> 02:10:42.517]  But out of the other side of their mouth, they're saying, OK, it's the plastics causing their infertility.
[02:10:42.557 --> 02:10:46.359]  And you can say, well, there's too many people and pretend you're part of the power structure.
[02:10:46.379 --> 02:10:48.220]  But it gives you cancer.
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:49.461]  It gives you so many other problems.
[02:10:49.881 --> 02:10:54.344]  They are targeting all of us together right now.
[02:10:58.055 --> 02:11:01.738]  We are being hit by chemical and biological attack.
[02:11:03.180 --> 02:11:16.612]  Anyone that has survived COVID or the poison shots is a survivor of a biological nanotech synthetic genetically engineered system.
[02:11:20.215 --> 02:11:21.116]  And that's just the fact.
[02:11:21.236 --> 02:11:28.049]   So I don't know What you're supposed to do or even what I'm supposed to do, I'm just gonna warn people.
[02:11:29.089 --> 02:11:34.311]  And I just feel sorry for the people that lie about us and attack us and try to shut us down.
[02:11:36.632 --> 02:11:46.274]  When all we're trying to do is get people to start being concerned about the real issues that face humans on this planet and what's coming next if we don't.
[02:11:47.675 --> 02:11:50.096]  Now Paul Joseph Watson is scheduled to take over here.
[02:11:50.456 --> 02:11:51.416]  He'll take over next segment.
[02:11:53.078 --> 02:11:55.640]  And I hit a lot of the news today, but there's a lot I didn't cover.
[02:11:56.441 --> 02:12:00.523]  So we'll be filing some special reports and more at MandawVideo and Infowars.com.
[02:12:00.543 --> 02:12:02.345]  But this Zero Hedge article is very important.
[02:12:03.025 --> 02:12:06.228]  Biden administration anticipating wave of summer violence over Roe v. Wade.
[02:12:06.948 --> 02:12:17.035]  CNN and the Justice Department are now reporting that the violence in the Capitol is by anti-abortion advocates when none of that's true.
[02:12:17.856 --> 02:12:20.018]  So they've deliberately turned up the temperature.
[02:12:21.294 --> 02:12:36.725]  By announcing a leak of this draft, when they already had it ready over a year ago, to try to change the subject in the election away from inflation, open borders, world government, on to abortion, just as a distraction.
[02:12:36.745 --> 02:12:37.926]  I don't think abortion is a distraction.
[02:12:38.286 --> 02:12:40.268]  I'm saying they're using it as a distraction.
[02:12:40.919 --> 02:12:43.901]  All right, the War Room is in T-minus 62 minutes.
[02:12:44.361 --> 02:12:45.962]  We're going to go to break in the fourth hour.
[02:12:46.302 --> 02:12:47.783]  Paul Watson always kicks ass.
[02:12:48.144 --> 02:12:48.824]  He takes over.
[02:12:49.284 --> 02:12:51.446]  InfoWars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[02:12:51.266 --> 02:13:06.025]  I want to thank all our supporters again.
[02:13:06.049 --> 02:13:15.557]  Whether it's politics or health or spirituality, we're about bringing you the very best, documented, accurate, real-world information.

[02:13:24.110 --> 02:13:24.710]  They're incredible.

[02:13:29.652 --> 02:13:33.553]  It is the purest, highest quality atomic iodine you're going to find.
[02:13:33.793 --> 02:13:40.856]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals and compounds, so you don't absorb it at all or fully.
[02:13:41.596 --> 02:13:45.978]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a limited supply and it's been sold out for a month because of supply chain breakdowns.
[02:13:46.498 --> 02:13:50.880]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week.
[02:13:50.900 --> 02:13:51.881]  Then it goes back to full price.
[02:13:52.261 --> 02:13:54.382]  More than two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.
[02:13:54.902 --> 02:13:58.543]  Experience X2 for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:13:58.964 --> 02:14:00.844]  X2 at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:14:00.845 --> 02:14:02.845]  Take action now.
[02:14:02.845 --> 02:14:20.845]  [Music]
[02:14:20.845 --> 02:14:26.845]   We are live. It is the Summit News Hour on this 19th of May 2022.
[02:14:27.419 --> 02:14:31.182]  Huge raft of subjects coming up over the course of the next hour.
[02:14:31.843 --> 02:14:37.128]  Of course, big in the news is the fact that the Queen of Disinfo has been dethroned.
[02:14:37.828 --> 02:14:39.169]  Big sisses, big sad.
[02:14:39.269 --> 02:14:56.099]   That is of course the would-be leader of the Department of Homeland Security's Ministry of Truth having to be wrapped up, suspended, Kayboshed basically because they claim a coordinated right-wing disinformation campaign.
[02:14:56.159 --> 02:14:59.262]  Really, we'll see what is actually going on with that.
[02:15:00.123 --> 02:15:11.846]   We've also got Twitter introducing a new policy during what they call crisis situations, which is basically if a Transgender gets called a man on Twitter.
[02:15:11.866 --> 02:15:19.674]  That's a crisis situation in their eyes, saying that they're going to slap more warning labels, more censorship on tweets.
[02:15:19.754 --> 02:15:29.285]  The woke employees, some of whom are being fired right now, are really trying to get their digs in before a potential takeover by Elon Musk.
[02:15:30.071 --> 02:15:42.142]  The fallout from the Buffalo shooting continues with New York Governor Kathy Hochul announcing that they're going to create a new police unit to combat, quote, hate speech, which as we know is basically thought crime.
[02:15:43.063 --> 02:15:55.215]  But in the UK, we have a top cop who says that because the lowest ever proportion of actual crimes are being solved, they should stop focusing on speech offences.
[02:15:56.078 --> 02:16:09.002]  We're also going to talk about a CDC study or a new set of figures released where they say they're investigating in the United States 180 cases of children with hepatitis of unknown cause.
[02:16:09.642 --> 02:16:14.344]  It's a total mystery despite the fact that it's happening worldwide.
[02:16:14.764 --> 02:16:22.246]  It's happening in the UK and top health experts in the UK have said precisely what has caused it.
[02:16:23.044 --> 02:16:26.085]  And we'll go on to talk about what has caused it.
[02:16:26.585 --> 02:16:31.686]  The mainstream media, legacy media in the United States aren't even mentioning.
[02:16:32.447 --> 02:16:42.289]  Meanwhile, the WHO is to make lockdowns part of its official pandemic guidance, despite the fact that there's voluminous evidence that lockdowns have been an absolute disaster.
[02:16:42.669 --> 02:16:45.250]  Major studies attesting to that fact.
[02:16:46.610 --> 02:16:54.111]   We also have a TV presenter in the UK Saying that food shortages will lead to cannibalism.
[02:16:54.591 --> 02:16:58.294]  And he was only half-joking when he made that prediction, of course.
[02:16:59.034 --> 02:17:01.656]  Massive global wheat shortages.
[02:17:01.696 --> 02:17:10.903]  We have top Russian officials now warning of a global famine likely to happen this year because, basically, of the world's support for the current thing.
[02:17:11.846 --> 02:17:21.150]  Joe Biden's failed to comment on one mass shooting that occurred in America last weekend, in addition to the Buffalo shooting, because it didn't fit the narrative.
[02:17:21.170 --> 02:17:22.171]  We're going to get into that.
[02:17:23.372 --> 02:17:31.435]  And the LGBT flag, if you could believe this was physically possible, is now adding more colours.
[02:17:32.176 --> 02:17:34.837]  Yeah, if you didn't think it was an ugly mess to begin with.
[02:17:35.996 --> 02:17:38.758]  A vomit of rainbows, basically.
[02:17:39.198 --> 02:17:46.562]  Now it's going to be even more complex to satiate another extreme minority group.
[02:17:47.502 --> 02:17:50.924]  Meanwhile, Disney announces LGBT clothing line for children.
[02:17:51.505 --> 02:17:57.488]  Apparently their complete collapse in favorability isn't deterring them from satiating the woke mob.
[02:17:59.150 --> 02:18:16.007]  We have a criminal, a dangerous thought criminal, who put tire marks on an LGBT crosswalk in Canada, or actually in Florida, now being ordered by a judge to write 25 pages of LGBT fiction.
[02:18:16.047 --> 02:18:37.781]   Yes, his thought crime will be punished with re-education on how this Oppressed minority group is really so downtrodden despite the fact that literally every major corporation, every major government, the judicial system punishes its critics with social re-education campaigns.
[02:18:37.801 --> 02:18:41.203]  We're going to get into all that and a host more on the other side.
[02:18:41.283 --> 02:18:42.964]  This is the Summit News Hour.
[02:18:43.084 --> 02:18:44.064]  Summit.News.
[02:18:44.164 --> 02:18:44.825]  Don't go away.
[02:18:45.205 --> 02:18:45.625]  We'll be back.
[02:18:46.348 --> 02:18:56.337]  We are live and we're going to start with lockdown with the continuing devastating impact that global lockdowns have had on mental health and on health itself.
[02:18:56.397 --> 02:18:58.739]  We have this headline out of Summit.News.
[02:18:59.340 --> 02:19:05.706]  CDC now investigating 180 cases of children with hepatitis of unknown cause.
[02:19:05.766 --> 02:19:07.347]  It's a complete mystery to them.
[02:19:08.528 --> 02:19:12.672]  CDC is now investigating 180 cases of children with hepatitis of an unknown cause.
[02:19:13.306 --> 02:19:36.646]  Although health experts in the UK know what the cause is, and they've already basically said what it is, yet the CBC reported, or CNBC, sorry, that they just have no clue why there's this sudden spate of hepatitis cases, not just in the United States, but across the world, where kids are having to have urgent organ transplants.
[02:19:37.026 --> 02:19:38.227]  Kids in Ireland have died.
[02:19:38.267 --> 02:19:41.310]  There have been five deaths in the United States so far.
[02:19:42.048 --> 02:19:45.190]  And they're just holding their hands up and saying, we don't know why this is happening.
[02:19:46.071 --> 02:19:55.037]  They reported, quote, adenovirus infection is being investigated as being the possible cause, with nearly half the kids testing positive for the pathogen.
[02:19:55.797 --> 02:20:03.162]  Now what they don't tell you is that adenoviruses normally lead to causing the common cold.
[02:20:03.740 --> 02:20:10.445]  But because kids have weakened immune systems because of lockdown, they're unable to fight it off.
[02:20:11.005 --> 02:20:15.008]  And then it gets worse and it becomes the hepatitis infection.
[02:20:16.078 --> 02:20:21.840]  That's the reason why there are hepatitis cases in children now exploding all over the world.
[02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:34.705]  And people, experts in the UK have said that, yet there's no mention of it throughout this entire CNBC article or in any of the other legacy media articles I saw yesterday.
[02:20:35.705 --> 02:20:49.759]   Professor Simon Taylor Robinson said, I think it's likely that children mixing in kindergartens and schools have lower immunity to seasonal adenoviruses than in previous years because of restrictions.
[02:20:49.839 --> 02:21:01.363]  In other words, because of lockdown, because these kids have not been socialised, they've not been around other kids enough, the mask wearing is also played a part, their immune systems are basically shot.
[02:21:02.384 --> 02:21:19.624]   Whether the vaccines have any additional impact in terms of Crippling their immune systems is certainly up for debate, but there's no debate that lockdown has weakened children's immune systems and made them more prone to all these other viruses.
[02:21:20.224 --> 02:21:32.329]  The professor went on to say, quote, this means they could be more at risk of developing hepatitis because their immune response is weaker to the virus because of this absolute hysterical panic.
[02:21:33.018 --> 02:21:52.736]  About keeping kids away from each other, despite the fact, for example, in the UK, even during the height of the coronavirus pandemic, children under the age of 15 were more likely to be killed by falling over putting their pants on than from COVID-19 virus itself.
[02:21:53.537 --> 02:21:57.621]  But now they are at risk for all these other horrible viruses.
[02:21:58.231 --> 02:22:14.418]  Now in this CNBC article, which completely failed to mention that health experts in the UK have already explained this, it's due to lockdowns that they supported, they said the CDC is still conducting lab tests to see if the COVID virus might also be a possible cause.
[02:22:14.878 --> 02:22:22.761]  Every time there's a new outbreak of some weird virus that they can't explain, they always blame it on COVID itself.
[02:22:23.556 --> 02:22:32.280]  Despite the fact that the children impacted in the initial cluster of cases in Alabama in this hepatitis outbreak did not have COVID-19.
[02:22:32.340 --> 02:22:34.101]  So they're studying the wrong thing.
[02:22:34.521 --> 02:22:38.823]  They should be studying the drastic consequences of lockdown.
[02:22:39.843 --> 02:22:42.885]  And again, it's not just physical health, it's mental health.
[02:22:43.545 --> 02:23:01.602]   We had an article last week where the Royal Society Open Science Journal Found that lockdowns in the UK caused around 60,000 children to suffer clinical depression, and of course those are only the numbers who are being vocal about it, who are going to doctors, therapists, getting treatment for it.
[02:23:02.083 --> 02:23:05.005]  The actual number is probably far higher.
[02:23:06.186 --> 02:23:22.442]   We featured before a prominent study by Johns Hopkins University Concluding that global lockdowns have had a much more detrimental impact on society than they have produced any benefit, with researchers urging they are ill-founded and should be rejected as a pandemic policy instrument.
[02:23:22.883 --> 02:23:25.747]  Yet, what is the WHO out doing today?
[02:23:26.454 --> 02:23:30.776]  Making lockdowns part of official pandemic guidance.
[02:23:31.496 --> 02:23:44.961]  Again, despite the fact that Sweden did not impose any strict lockdown measures or mask mandates at any step of the way and their mortality rate per capita was one of the lowest in Europe.
[02:23:45.401 --> 02:23:50.603]  What they did worked and everyone ignored it because the technocrats need that power.
[02:23:50.903 --> 02:23:53.224]  They need that precedent to lock us down again.
[02:23:54.045 --> 02:23:56.406]  Who knows what they're going to do with this monkeypox thing?
[02:23:57.286 --> 02:24:12.491]  Again, despite the fact that it's not very infectious at all, the media's slowly building up that drumbeat of panic around monkey virus to probably try and get the mask mandates back in place, despite the fact that that doesn't even stop it from being transmitted.
[02:24:13.636 --> 02:24:16.998]  WHO to make lockdowns part of official pandemic guidance.
[02:24:17.098 --> 02:24:26.725]  Daily Skeptic reports the World Health Organization is to make lockdowns and other non-pharmaceutical interventions intended to curb viral spread of the official pandemic guidance.
[02:24:27.465 --> 02:24:43.296]  So again, they're taking what didn't work, what caused disastrous consequences in terms of mental health, physical health, the economy, poverty, and they just said we're going to apply it once again when the next pandemic comes along, which Bill Gates has obviously promised.
[02:24:44.399 --> 02:24:46.203]  Now I made a video about this yesterday.
[02:24:47.326 --> 02:25:11.585]   I'm still seeing parents with baby strollers with prams Either the parents are still wearing masks, literally four months after all legal mask mandates ended in England, and in some cases the kids are still wearing masks too, despite the known cognitive disorders that they're causing for a generation of babies and toddlers.
[02:25:11.625 --> 02:25:14.687]  This video is called, They Just Won't Stop.
[02:25:14.887 --> 02:25:15.328]  Here it is.
[02:25:16.223 --> 02:25:23.085]  More evidence emerging of the tremendous damage that lockdowns and other restrictions have had on the cognitive development of infants.
[02:25:23.125 --> 02:25:27.847]  This time it's the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists sounding the alarm bell.
[02:25:27.907 --> 02:25:36.389]  The Telegraph reports, Experts said that repeated lockdowns had left young children without the chance to play and learn how to communicate, setting back their development.
[02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:44.852]  Assessments show that one in five children are not meeting expected standards by age two and a half, with thousands likely to need help such as speech and language therapy.
[02:25:44.952 --> 02:25:47.714]  A recent report by Ofsted came to a similar conclusion.
[02:25:47.754 --> 02:25:57.201]  Investigators found that infants who were surrounded by adults wearing face masks for much of the past two years has damaged their learning and communication abilities.
[02:25:57.321 --> 02:26:05.727]  Those turning two, quote, will have been surrounded by adults wearing masks for their whole lives and have therefore been unable to see lip movements or mouth shapes as regular.
[02:26:05.767 --> 02:26:08.969]  The restrictions also left toddlers struggling with crawling.
[02:26:09.489 --> 02:26:12.391]  Using the toilet independently and making friends.
[02:26:12.451 --> 02:26:15.532]  Therapists are unable to keep up with the demand.
[02:26:15.572 --> 02:26:24.517]  They're being flooded with one speech therapist reporting a 364% increase in patient referrals of babies and toddlers.
[02:26:24.557 --> 02:26:31.061]  Jacqueline Teague says during this pandemic her speech therapy clinic has seen an enormous shift in the ages of their patients.
[02:26:31.661 --> 02:26:35.386]  Before the pandemic, only 5% of patients were babies and toddlers.
[02:26:35.746 --> 02:26:37.268]  Today, it has soared to 20%.
[02:26:38.871 --> 02:26:41.314]  Many parents calling it COVID-delayed.
[02:26:41.714 --> 02:26:48.884]  We've seen a 364% increase in patient referrals of babies and toddlers from pediatricians and parents.
[02:26:49.921 --> 02:26:53.025]  And they are children that are having a difficult time speaking.
[02:26:53.226 --> 02:26:53.886]  Speech delayed.
[02:26:54.327 --> 02:26:57.752]  Babies start learning how to speak by reading lips as young as eight months.
[02:26:58.352 --> 02:27:01.877]  So what happens when lips and faces are covered up by masks?
[02:27:02.017 --> 02:27:04.180]  We're seeing a lot of things that look just like...
[02:27:04.921 --> 02:27:05.361]  Autism.
[02:27:05.602 --> 02:27:11.166]  They're not making any word attempts and not communicating at all with their family.
[02:27:11.206 --> 02:27:19.892]  Another study out of Germany found that the reading ability of children has plummeted compared to pre-corona times thanks to lockdown policies that led to the closure of schools.
[02:27:19.992 --> 02:27:28.698]   And even here in England where there haven't been any face mask restrictions in place for months, I still see masked And we have yet more research out on this today.
[02:27:28.758 --> 02:27:30.299]  Again, this is out the Daily Skeptic.
[02:27:30.179 --> 02:27:34.898]   parents would have at least questioned what impact constantly covering their face has
[02:27:34.898 --> 02:27:42.139]   had on their own children. But apparently not. And they just won't stop.
[02:27:42.139 --> 02:27:47.419]   And we have yet more research out on this today. Again, this is out the Daily Skeptic.
[02:27:47.419 --> 02:27:51.119]  Youngest children most harmed by lockdowns research finds.
[02:27:51.119 --> 02:27:54.639]   The youngest children have been most affected by lockdowns and school closures during
[02:27:54.639 --> 02:27:58.779]   the COVID pandemic, with new research finding the educational progress and social
[02:27:58.779 --> 02:28:04.779]   development of four and five year olds suffered severely during their first year at school.
[02:28:04.794 --> 02:28:06.336]  Aggressive behaviour!
[02:28:06.836 --> 02:28:12.580]  Such as biting and hitting feelings of struggling in class, of being overwhelmed, are now commonplace.
[02:28:12.660 --> 02:28:15.601]  They've wrecked an entire generation of children.
[02:28:15.921 --> 02:28:17.783]  Who's going to take responsibility for it?
[02:28:18.103 --> 02:28:23.226]  And who's going to stand up to the WHO and say, no, we're not going to lock down again.
[02:28:23.506 --> 02:28:24.587]  It was a disaster.
[02:28:24.927 --> 02:28:26.308]  It's not happening again.
[02:28:26.388 --> 02:28:26.808]  We'll be back.
[02:28:27.816 --> 02:28:49.710]  Well, the Deep State suffered a big blow yesterday when it was forced to suspend its creepy Ministry of Truth disinformation board, and they said they did so on the premise that the right wing, the conservative media, had engaged in a coordinated campaign of disinformation to mischaracterize the true intention of this body.
[02:28:50.411 --> 02:28:57.115]  Which, again, is quite ironic given it was headed up, or planned to be headed up, by Nina Jankowicz.
[02:28:57.927 --> 02:29:00.808]  Dubbed the Mary Poppins of disinformation.
[02:29:01.248 --> 02:29:08.970]  Somebody who has a history replete with pushing the most egregious disinformation you could ever imagine.
[02:29:09.010 --> 02:29:10.970]  We have a headline here up on summit.news.
[02:29:11.490 --> 02:29:15.171]  Government claims DHS disinfo board is shut down because of disinfo.
[02:29:15.552 --> 02:29:17.232]  Again, that's incredibly ironic.
[02:29:17.782 --> 02:29:24.225]  Because they cite the reason for shutting it down being disinfo, but that narrative is literally disinfo.
[02:29:24.265 --> 02:29:26.706]  It wasn't a coordinated smear campaign.
[02:29:27.006 --> 02:29:29.928]  It's called legitimate criticism.
[02:29:30.308 --> 02:29:32.229]  And I made a video about this earlier today.
[02:29:32.669 --> 02:29:34.450]  Big Sis is big mad.
[02:29:34.569 --> 02:29:36.569]  Here it is.
[02:29:36.569 --> 02:29:44.569]  Big sis is big sad.
[02:29:44.443 --> 02:29:51.726]  The Department of Homeland Security has been forced to suspend its creepy disinformation board before it even got off the ground.
[02:29:51.786 --> 02:29:56.188]  And its would-be leader, Nina Jankiewicz, isn't taking it too well.
[02:29:56.248 --> 02:30:01.289]  So every characterization of the board that you've heard up until now has been incorrect.
[02:30:01.850 --> 02:30:07.432]  And frankly, it's kind of ironic that the board itself was taken over by disinformation when it was meant to fight it.
[02:30:07.572 --> 02:30:07.752]  Yeah.
[02:30:07.932 --> 02:30:09.994]  You know what's also kind of ironic?
[02:30:10.094 --> 02:30:15.479]  A unit to fight disinformation being headed up by you, the Queen of Disinformation.
[02:30:15.539 --> 02:30:17.821]  You claimed the Deep State doesn't exist.
[02:30:18.101 --> 02:30:30.192]  I'm talking about the Deep State and things like that, which is a thread among conspiracy communities here in the United States, that there is this secret cabal here in Washington working to undermine the American people.
[02:30:30.553 --> 02:30:31.894]  It couldn't be farther from the truth.
[02:30:31.954 --> 02:30:33.055]  That's disinformation.
[02:30:33.115 --> 02:30:37.239]  You promoted the claim that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian propaganda.
[02:30:37.279 --> 02:30:38.400]  That's disinformation.
[02:30:38.420 --> 02:30:46.949]  You cited Christopher Steele as an expert on disinformation, the author of the infamous Trump Peagate dossier, which was wholly a product...
[02:30:47.489 --> 02:30:48.550]  Move disinformation!
[02:30:48.590 --> 02:30:56.937]  You defended and excused the behavior of Ukrainian paramilitary groups, including the Azov Battalion, while they were literally committing war crimes.
[02:30:57.017 --> 02:30:58.118]  That's disinformation.
[02:30:58.179 --> 02:31:05.385]  You falsely characterized parents' legitimate concerns about critical race theory being taught in schools as disinformation.
[02:31:05.445 --> 02:31:06.746]  That's disinformation!
[02:31:06.766 --> 02:31:07.627]  Disinformation.
[02:31:07.787 --> 02:31:08.928]  It's okay when we do it.
[02:31:08.948 --> 02:31:09.829]  It's kind of ironic.
[02:31:09.869 --> 02:31:13.592]  Then the disinformation board is being shut down because of disinformation.
[02:31:13.752 --> 02:31:22.958]  Isn't it interesting how there's almost a total Venn diagram overlap between disinformation and information that embarrasses the regime?
[02:31:23.038 --> 02:31:23.819]  Funny that, isn't it?
[02:31:23.999 --> 02:31:31.524]  Almost like the entire contrived moral panic over disinformation is just an excuse to shut down legitimate dissent.
[02:31:31.684 --> 02:31:32.525]  It's kind of ironic.
[02:31:32.585 --> 02:31:47.621]  As journalist Glenn Greenwald notes, she complains about right-wing disinformation scuppering the DHS disinfo board when the most devastating indictment of the whole operation and her was published by The Nation, a left-wing news outlet.
[02:31:47.701 --> 02:31:48.562]  It's kind of ironic.
[02:31:48.622 --> 02:31:49.163]  Newsflash.
[02:31:49.463 --> 02:31:55.669]  Large numbers of people being rightly concerned about the government literally launching a ministry of truth.
[02:31:55.769 --> 02:31:57.791]  It isn't a coordinated attack.
[02:31:58.011 --> 02:32:00.213]  It isn't right-wing disinformation.
[02:32:00.573 --> 02:32:02.615]  It's speaking truth to power.
[02:32:02.755 --> 02:32:08.340]  All these sensationalist narratives about what the board was, what people thought the board was going to do, are completely wrong.
[02:32:08.440 --> 02:32:10.062]  It was a coordinating mechanism.
[02:32:10.142 --> 02:32:11.163]  Oh, don't worry, everyone.
[02:32:11.443 --> 02:32:14.566]  It was just a coordinating mechanism.
[02:32:14.946 --> 02:32:16.047]  This isn't happening!
[02:32:16.187 --> 02:32:17.748]  Everyone look away please!
[02:32:17.788 --> 02:32:18.908]  Nothing to see here!
[02:32:18.948 --> 02:32:24.031]  ...that just happened to be led by someone who literally said free speech makes her shudder.
[02:32:24.091 --> 02:32:30.134]  By someone who said free speech was like, quote, fairy dust, suggesting it doesn't even exist.
[02:32:30.214 --> 02:32:37.818]  By somebody who demanded the power for trustworthy regime propagandists like her to edit your tweets.
[02:32:38.078 --> 02:32:40.760]  Um, and I am eligible for it because I'm verified.
[02:32:41.420 --> 02:32:46.241]  But there are a lot of people who shouldn't be verified who aren't, you know, legit, in my opinion.
[02:32:46.281 --> 02:32:49.141]  I mean, they are real people, but they're not trustworthy.
[02:32:49.201 --> 02:33:00.764]  Anyway, so verified people can essentially start to edit Twitter the same sort of way that Wikipedia is, so they can add context to certain tweets.
[02:33:00.804 --> 02:33:06.265]  This initiative wasn't involved in policing speech, and neither was I. No, they're not policing your speech.
[02:33:06.605 --> 02:33:07.025]  They're just...
[02:33:07.925 --> 02:33:08.846]  Editing your tweets.
[02:33:08.986 --> 02:33:15.712]  By someone who wrote a book replete with bizarre hypothetical scenarios about men being sexist to her on the street.
[02:33:15.812 --> 02:33:18.494]  Deploying the same words they use on social media.
[02:33:18.614 --> 02:33:22.997]  One example being, TikTok, that's the sound of your biological clock ticking.
[02:33:23.338 --> 02:33:26.801]  Better go home and try to make a baby before it's too late, sweetheart.
[02:33:30.885 --> 02:33:36.286]  By someone who wrote in said book that such misogynists should be arrested by the police.
[02:33:36.426 --> 02:33:39.907]  By someone who called Elon Musk a quote online abuser.
[02:33:39.987 --> 02:33:43.027]  By someone who said America was too free spirited.
[02:33:43.127 --> 02:33:46.188]  By someone who said the lockdowns weren't draconian enough.
[02:33:46.428 --> 02:33:51.369]  By someone who literally tweeted quote force away lockers down.
[02:33:51.629 --> 02:33:55.750]  And by someone who sang with zealous glee about wanting to step on our enemies.
[02:33:55.569 --> 02:34:03.569]   I wanna be rich, famous and powerful, step on all my enemies and never do a thing.
[02:34:03.569 --> 02:34:08.569]   But according to Janka Wipps, she's a nuanced, reasonable person.
[02:34:08.662 --> 02:34:13.946]  I have prided myself over my career of being a really nuanced, reasonable person.
[02:34:13.986 --> 02:34:15.287]  Hold up, Scary Poppins.
[02:34:15.327 --> 02:34:16.528]  Let's do a quick recap.
[02:34:16.568 --> 02:34:20.651]  Free speech is sinister, shudder-inducing, and shouldn't exist.
[02:34:20.891 --> 02:34:25.355]  Approved regime apparatchiks should have the power to edit and censor your tweets.
[02:34:25.576 --> 02:34:30.620]  The government, run by her, gets to decide what's free speech and what's disinformation.
[02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:33.984]  Men should be thrown in prison for online misogyny.
[02:34:34.184 --> 02:34:36.186]  And lock me down harder, daddy.
[02:34:36.346 --> 02:34:37.247]  So reasonable.
[02:34:37.307 --> 02:34:38.268]  Reasonable person.
[02:34:38.308 --> 02:34:43.813]  None of that sounds nuanced or reasonable, but it does totally sound like a narcissistic control freak.
[02:34:43.933 --> 02:34:48.436]  And someone who shouldn't be in charge of anything remotely related to free speech.
[02:34:48.656 --> 02:34:52.159]  She also ludicrously claims that she was non-partisan.
[02:34:52.239 --> 02:34:55.581]  To say that I'm just a partisan actor was wildly out of context.
[02:34:55.601 --> 02:35:03.166]  You amplified the Peagate dossier, a piece of actual disinformation that the regime pushed to try to stop Trump winning the election.
[02:35:03.366 --> 02:35:12.049]  You ceaselessly raged against Trump before the election, then amplified the actual disinformation that Russia interfered in it to help him win.
[02:35:12.089 --> 02:35:19.991]  You called on people to vote for Hillary Clinton, literally tweeting hashtag I'm with her, while claiming a Trump win would embolden ISIS.
[02:35:20.091 --> 02:35:21.491]  Trump actually destroyed ISIS.
[02:35:21.551 --> 02:35:25.953]  You were recruited by a left-wing anti-Trump resistance group in 2017.
[02:35:27.093 --> 02:35:34.320]  Well BFF is Taylor Lorenz, a hyper-partisan shit-lipped journo who made a career out of doxxing conservatives.
[02:35:34.420 --> 02:35:43.389]  The same left-wing activist who said you should be quote, off-limits from criticism and you've got the nerve to claim you're non-partisan.
[02:35:43.469 --> 02:35:46.031]  I'm just a partisan actor was was wildly out of contact.
[02:35:46.051 --> 02:35:47.393]  Do you think we're stupid?
[02:35:47.573 --> 02:35:49.495]  Evidently the answer is yes.
[02:35:52.797 --> 02:35:58.459]  Now there was an excellent article written by John Nolte out of Breitbart on this very subject.
[02:35:58.539 --> 02:36:14.185]  Washington Post debases itself in eulogy to Biden's fascist disinformation board and he lists or goes through a list of the fact that these same deep state regime entities that get to decide what's in disinformation and what's not, this is what they were responsible for.
[02:36:15.066 --> 02:36:22.248]   That telling us that Trump was a Russian spy, the coronavirus vaccine would stop the spread Global warming is real.
[02:36:22.348 --> 02:36:22.728]  It's not.
[02:36:23.108 --> 02:36:25.809]  Black Lives Matter rioters are immune to the virus.
[02:36:26.029 --> 02:36:26.650]  Remember that.
[02:36:27.070 --> 02:36:28.751]  Inflation is transitory.
[02:36:29.191 --> 02:36:31.272]  Raising taxes lowers inflation.
[02:36:31.292 --> 02:36:33.873]  Hunter Biden's laptop is Russian disinformation.
[02:36:34.153 --> 02:36:37.755]  The Capitol Hill police officers was beaten to death by Trump supporters.
[02:36:38.579 --> 02:36:53.446]  All that was, of course, completely false, yet the same regime that came out with all that weaponised, harmful disinformation thinks it gets the right to set itself up as the ultimate arbiter of the definition of disinformation.
[02:36:53.486 --> 02:36:58.348]  They don't, and at least for the time being, this programme is rightly suspended.
[02:36:58.408 --> 02:37:00.109]  Summit.News will be back, don't go away.
[02:37:01.570 --> 02:37:03.511]  So Big Sis is big sad.
[02:37:03.771 --> 02:37:08.133]  The Ministry of Truth has at least temporarily been disbanded.
[02:37:08.817 --> 02:37:17.962]  And now the legacy media is out pushing more disinformation than it was because of a coordinated right-wing disinformation campaign.
[02:37:18.002 --> 02:37:21.083]  That claim within and of itself is disinformation.
[02:37:21.463 --> 02:37:23.844]  It wasn't a coordinated smear campaign.
[02:37:24.205 --> 02:37:27.646]  It was legitimate criticism speaking truth to power.
[02:37:27.946 --> 02:37:38.136]   The genuine expression of concern about handing Power to the government to decide what's free speech, what's dangerous disinformation that gets banned.
[02:37:38.596 --> 02:37:43.762]  As we know, governments working hand-in-hand with social media to that very agenda.
[02:37:44.343 --> 02:37:46.966]  I mentioned this John Nolte article in Breitbart.
[02:37:47.887 --> 02:37:52.152]  Washington Post debases itself in eulogy to Biden's fascist disinformation board.
[02:37:52.788 --> 02:38:09.780]  He talks about the Washington Post article by Taylor Lorenz, who, as I mentioned in the video, literally made a career out of harassing and doxing conservatives and then cry bullies and claims that people are harassing her by providing her with legitimate criticism.
[02:38:10.321 --> 02:38:14.464]  He lists a few other things that I didn't even get the chance to mention in the video.
[02:38:15.396 --> 02:38:25.280]  From Nina Jankowicz, who of course pit-postures herself as a nuanced, reasonable person during that MSNBC interview with Chris Hayes.
[02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:42.066]  But he makes the point in this article that nowhere does the Washington Post tell its emotionally unstable subscribers that Jankowicz declared it a national security threat to ridicule her, Vice President Fraudulency Kamala Harris.
[02:38:42.754 --> 02:38:56.496]  So she literally thinks it's a national security threat to ridicule the Vice President of the United States, while the person writing the article, Taylor Lorenz, says that she should be beyond criticism.
[02:38:57.076 --> 02:39:09.419]  I notice a common pattern emerging here, which is these ruthless technocrats, these control freaks, thinking that your free speech doesn't include the right to criticize government officials.
[02:39:10.199 --> 02:39:11.279]  Oh, Russia does that?
[02:39:11.319 --> 02:39:11.859]  They're bad.
[02:39:12.515 --> 02:39:16.697]  They ban dissidents, they imprison dissidents, they kidnap dissidents, that's terrible.
[02:39:17.017 --> 02:39:18.737]  But we want the power to do it too!
[02:39:18.757 --> 02:39:20.238]  It's okay when we do it.
[02:39:21.438 --> 02:39:21.899]  He adds.
[02:39:23.059 --> 02:39:26.961]  Jankiewicz wanted to give approved elites the power to edit everyone else's tweets.
[02:39:27.001 --> 02:39:28.061]  I mentioned that in the video.
[02:39:28.901 --> 02:39:35.024]  She stated her fear of free speech absolutists, which in her mind means people who criticize those in power.
[02:39:35.144 --> 02:39:35.904]  Oh my god, the horror.
[02:39:37.279 --> 02:39:45.841]  She spread the audacious lie that social media censors leftists and marginalized communities more than conservatives, which on the face of it is absolutely insane.
[02:39:46.841 --> 02:39:55.323]  Go through a list of prominent right-wingers conservatives banned on Twitter over the past five years, compare that to prominent leftists.
[02:39:56.383 --> 02:39:57.463]  Bit of a difference there.
[02:39:59.424 --> 02:40:06.025]  Social media censors leftists, now she spread the Alpha Bank hoax or her propaganda about how men can give birth.
[02:40:06.630 --> 02:40:12.912]  And yes, she also said that parents who complain about CRT are basically pushing disinformation themselves.
[02:40:13.372 --> 02:40:15.452]  That common theme that it doesn't exist.
[02:40:15.512 --> 02:40:25.595]  Again, anything embarrassing, harmful to the narrative of the regime, it doesn't exist apart from when they talk about it and then it's a good thing, like the Great Replacement Theory.
[02:40:26.836 --> 02:40:33.657]  Or, he goes on to mention her fantasizing about having ghost sex with an underage Harry Potter.
[02:40:33.918 --> 02:40:35.278]  Absolutely disgusting.
[02:40:36.189 --> 02:40:50.576]  Very weird woman if you look into her background and her history, and very positive for Americans that she's not in charge of a board that could regulate free speech, could punish people for literally just criticising government officials.
[02:40:51.733 --> 02:40:57.057]  And on that subject, Twitter introduces policy to prevent spreading of misinformation during crises.
[02:40:57.097 --> 02:41:00.039]  Again, what is a crisis to a hysterical mob?
[02:41:00.459 --> 02:41:01.600]  Literally everything!
[02:41:02.181 --> 02:41:08.745]  Twitter announced on Thursday that it has introduced a new global policy to address the spread of misinformation during crisis situations.
[02:41:09.846 --> 02:41:15.771]  And again, this is so they can control the narrative the same with everything that happens on social media.
[02:41:16.551 --> 02:41:18.833]  Another thing happened this morning in the same vein.
[02:41:19.810 --> 02:41:44.021]  Occasionally you'll find on Twitter that, for whatever reason, an organic trending hashtag slips through the net, slips through the brick wall of censorship, and they immediately call upon their much vaunted fact-checkers, who of course we know are just propagandists again for the regime, literally working hand-in-hand with government, to denounce said topic, whatever it may be.
[02:41:45.023 --> 02:41:47.003]  This morning it happened to be chemtrails.
[02:41:47.684 --> 02:41:51.845]  People in the United Kingdom posting all these chemtrails over their houses.
[02:41:51.885 --> 02:41:56.145]  Whether you believe that's a legitimate issue or not, there are arguments on both sides.
[02:41:56.706 --> 02:42:11.649]  Within about an hour, they changed it from just an organic trending topic, chemtrails, to an official fact check of chemtrails and that it's all BS and that people who push it are all insane conspiracy theorists and they do that on a regular basis.
[02:42:12.574 --> 02:42:26.746]  Well now they announced today we're introducing our Crisis Misinformation Policy, a global policy that will guide our efforts to elevate credible, authoritative information, and will help to ensure viral misinformation isn't amplified or recommended by us during crises.
[02:42:26.806 --> 02:42:30.089]  Again, another attempt to control the narrative.
[02:42:30.569 --> 02:42:33.592]  Talking about controlling the narrative, let's go to this UFO video.
[02:42:34.052 --> 02:42:41.809]   Because back in the 90s, as I explained, UFOs, alien abductions was seen as a crank, fringe, extremist theory.
[02:42:42.249 --> 02:42:44.472]  Now it's endorsed by the establishment.
[02:42:44.852 --> 02:42:47.074]  Now they're having congressional hearings about it.
[02:42:47.395 --> 02:42:50.779]  And now the deep state is literally legitimizing it.
[02:42:50.919 --> 02:42:53.442]  Why could that possibly be?
[02:42:53.802 --> 02:42:54.583]  Here's the video.
[02:42:54.623 --> 02:42:56.565]  Pentagon confirms UFOs are real.
[02:42:56.605 --> 02:42:57.166]  Let's roll it.
[02:42:57.726 --> 02:43:03.494]  The Pentagon has confirmed that at least some UFOs are real and are unexplainable.
[02:43:03.534 --> 02:43:09.303]  The admission was made during the first congressional hearing into the subject of UFOs for 50 years.
[02:43:09.503 --> 02:43:20.397]   Top military officials spoke about how some of these unexplained aerial phenomena UAPs, the military term for UFOs, had no discernible means of propulsion.
[02:43:20.236 --> 02:43:28.176]   These include 11 UFO near-misses with US aircraft, including this newly released video captured by a pilot in
[02:43:28.176 --> 02:43:30.316]  the cockpit of a Navy fighter jet.
[02:43:30.316 --> 02:43:48.156]   There are a small handful of events in which there are flight characteristics or signature
[02:43:48.156 --> 02:43:51.676]   management that we can't explain with the data we have available,
[02:43:51.676 --> 02:43:54.635]  said Scott Bray, the Deputy Director of Naval Intelligence.
[02:43:54.829 --> 02:43:57.491]  Those are obviously the ones that are of most interest to us.
[02:43:57.711 --> 02:44:00.733]  My question is, why is all this coming out now?
[02:44:00.893 --> 02:44:05.356]  I grew up in the 90s, completely obsessed with the subject of UFOs.
[02:44:05.436 --> 02:44:11.760]  But back then, governments and the legacy media treated the entire issue with nothing but scorn and derision.
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:14.382]  Ufologists were seen as fringe cranks.
[02:44:14.702 --> 02:44:17.645]  And people who reported sightings were ridiculed.
[02:44:17.726 --> 02:44:29.198]  And all this was after decades of popular culture in terms of television and blockbuster movies, satiating the public with the social engineering that it was actually all real and all being covered up.
[02:44:29.358 --> 02:44:30.159]  What changed?
[02:44:30.339 --> 02:44:39.188]   Why, around 10 to 15 years ago, did the establishment suddenly do a 180 And start treating the subject with so much seriousness.
[02:44:39.288 --> 02:44:47.355]  It's widely accepted that the Deep State has exploited the obsession around UFOs as a camouflage for top-secret military technology.
[02:44:47.415 --> 02:44:56.702]   It's always helpful to push the idea that people witnessing tests of cutting-edge propulsion systems and exotic aircraft We're actually seeing alien spaceships.
[02:44:56.722 --> 02:44:58.843]  And what about alien abductions?
[02:44:58.963 --> 02:45:00.424]  Cattle mutilations?
[02:45:00.484 --> 02:45:08.928]  Could the explanation be something far more sinister than benevolent alien visitation, and something far closer to home?
[02:45:09.048 --> 02:45:22.915]   If you thought the last two years proved how easy it was to manipulate the public into mass compliance, just think what the legitimization of alien visitation, or the prospect of off-planetary threats, Would accomplish.
[02:45:23.035 --> 02:45:30.082]  Just ponder what technocratic control freak hell could be unleashed if the public is convinced that E.T.
[02:45:30.142 --> 02:45:31.464]  is about to invade.
[02:45:31.524 --> 02:45:39.892]  Why do you think the subject of UFOs and aliens is now being endorsed by the Pentagon, the legacy media, and the establishment in general?
[02:45:39.993 --> 02:45:41.114]  Let me know in the comments below.
[02:45:43.618 --> 02:45:44.359]  So there you have it.
[02:45:44.459 --> 02:46:05.241]   Again, the establishment having flipped from about 15 years ago from deriding the entire UFO alien abduction subject as fringe crank conspiracy theorist material, now literally having congressional hearings where top military brass Say that in, at least in some cases, it's real, they can't explain it.
[02:46:05.701 --> 02:46:17.494]  Used to be the case that they were supposedly terrified about revealing the existence of aliens to the public because they'd panic or some Wales War of the Worlds style, but now they've completely flipped.
[02:46:17.614 --> 02:46:18.274]  Why is that?
[02:46:18.375 --> 02:46:19.356]  Very interesting.
[02:46:19.376 --> 02:46:19.876]  We'll be back.
[02:46:19.996 --> 02:46:20.497]  Don't go away.
[02:46:21.983 --> 02:46:35.608]  Now I'm going to come back in the final five minutes and cover some of this remaining news, including now they're adding new colours to the LGBT plus QI whatever, however many letters they've added to it.
[02:46:36.288 --> 02:46:39.889]  Almost as many colours are now being added to the flag.
[02:46:40.049 --> 02:46:41.790]  It's beyond parody.
[02:46:42.410 --> 02:46:44.351]  I'm going to get into that, but we have this story.
[02:46:45.484 --> 02:47:14.530]   Back in May last year, Patrice Khan-Cullors, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter, constantly whinging about, quote, white supremacy in the housing market, then going on to spend 3.2 million dollars, that's a good grift if you can get it, on four homes, including a 1.4 million property in LA's rustic and semi-remote Topanga Canyon, which has a black population, Of just 1.6%.
[02:47:14.890 --> 02:47:18.673]  Seems to be quite eager to get away from other black people, who knows why?
[02:47:19.571 --> 02:47:30.835]  But of course, the Ponzi scheme that is Black Lives Matter, the scandal surrounding that has deepened to an infinite degree in the year since this article was published.
[02:47:31.375 --> 02:47:42.759]  And here's Nigel Farage talking about the latest scandal involving Black Lives Matter and the Ponzi scheme of this establishment-controlled organisation.
[02:47:42.839 --> 02:47:44.280]  Here is Nigel Farage.
[02:47:44.620 --> 02:47:45.920]  Black Lives Matter.
[02:47:46.020 --> 02:47:46.861]  You must remember 2020.
[02:47:46.921 --> 02:47:50.262]  People chanting, screaming it.
[02:47:50.562 --> 02:47:51.482]  There was hysteria.
[02:47:51.722 --> 02:47:54.603]  There were police officers in London taking the knee.
[02:47:54.683 --> 02:47:57.224]  Indeed, many football teams still do.
[02:47:57.384 --> 02:47:59.144]  Yes, Black Lives Matter.
[02:47:59.204 --> 02:48:03.186]  This wonderful organisation campaigning for racial justice.
[02:48:03.246 --> 02:48:07.527]  And anybody that dared to stand in its way was a bad person.
[02:48:08.027 --> 02:48:09.027]  And should be cancelled?
[02:48:09.227 --> 02:48:12.428]  Well, many of us that stood up to it were.
[02:48:13.168 --> 02:48:15.409]  I did because I knew Black Lives Matter from America.
[02:48:15.809 --> 02:48:19.409]  I knew what it swept across after the horrible death of George Floyd.
[02:48:20.030 --> 02:48:23.230]  I knew this was an organisation I did not trust.
[02:48:23.430 --> 02:48:29.532]  I knew this was an organisation more intent on division than it was on bringing anyone together.
[02:48:30.212 --> 02:48:31.992]  Well, try this for size.
[02:48:32.692 --> 02:48:41.558]   The accounts have been issued for 2020, a year In which the organisation raised $90 million.
[02:48:41.618 --> 02:48:43.479]  That's right, $90 million.
[02:48:43.919 --> 02:48:50.704]  And much of the funding came from the usual suspects, organisations linked to Soros, which have been backing BLM for years.
[02:48:51.504 --> 02:48:55.147]  Much of it also coming from big corporate America.
[02:48:55.487 --> 02:48:59.370]  You know, the people on the West Coast, the tech giants, all of these guys.
[02:48:59.770 --> 02:49:05.894]  Most of it, though, coming from ordinary men and women who were taken in thinking this was a good organisation.
[02:49:06.374 --> 02:49:06.875]  What did we learn?
[02:49:07.535 --> 02:49:28.205]   From the accounts, well, we learn that Patrice Colors, who's been running the organization for some years, well, she seems to have had a very good year because she's managed to purchase four real estate properties since 2020 in America, including one In Los Angeles, a nice seven-bedroom pad costing six million dollars.
[02:49:28.225 --> 02:49:36.809]  Yes, she owns it, but she says that it's for housing needs and for production studios.
[02:49:36.889 --> 02:49:40.411]  It sounds like quite a studio, but not content with that.
[02:49:40.871 --> 02:49:46.553]  The father of her child has earned nearly a million dollars organizing live events.
[02:49:47.614 --> 02:49:51.455]  And, surprise, surprise, her brother got a security contract for $840,000.
[02:49:52.015 --> 02:50:00.959]  One of her fellow directors has managed to earn $2.1 million providing services to the company.
[02:50:01.479 --> 02:50:04.881]  And the more you go through this list, the worse and worse it gets.
[02:50:05.081 --> 02:50:05.421]  It's clear.
[02:50:06.261 --> 02:50:18.728]  That this woman and her friends in BLM, out of the open-heartedness and gratitude of many people who thought that BLM was doing the right thing, this woman has taken their money.
[02:50:19.089 --> 02:50:21.510]  It is a complete and utter disgrace.
[02:50:21.670 --> 02:50:29.115]  It exposes Black Lives Matter as a completely crooked organisation, intent on lining their own pockets.
[02:50:29.275 --> 02:50:31.511]   Intent On creating more division.
[02:50:31.812 --> 02:50:34.712]  Has anything improved as a result of their protests?
[02:50:34.932 --> 02:50:37.133]  No, I don't think so.
[02:50:37.673 --> 02:50:55.639]  I'm just wondering now, whether all the lovies, all the great and the good, all of those who condemn me for what I said, whether they, you know, present match of the day or whatever else it is, whether they're actors, I just wonder whether any of them will actually be embarrassed.
[02:50:55.959 --> 02:51:00.661]   I wonder whether any of them We'll apologise for backing this organisation.
[02:51:00.841 --> 02:51:05.704]  I expect in return a stony wall of silence.
[02:51:05.804 --> 02:51:09.206]  But at least BLM have been exposed.
[02:51:09.666 --> 02:51:12.488]  And really folks, what we should be thinking about is this.
[02:51:13.368 --> 02:51:14.489]  Not dividing people up.
[02:51:15.293 --> 02:51:26.942]  In terms of their race, ethnicity, sexuality, age or class, what we should be doing as a society is trying to bring people together in a spirit of meritocracy.
[02:51:27.442 --> 02:51:34.587]  It would be so much better if our kids at school were taught to be colourblind, which in many ways, naturally, they are.
[02:51:34.607 --> 02:51:46.156]   I was with a friend at the weekend who said to me, Nigel, we're probably the last generation who will look upon people as Regardless of their skin colour, we'll be colourblind to all of these things.
[02:51:46.537 --> 02:51:54.123]  And now we're all to be divided up, and to be labelled, and to hate each other, and to get ready for the great Marxist takeover.
[02:51:54.703 --> 02:51:57.565]  I hope this little video exposes BLM to you.
[02:51:58.006 --> 02:51:59.247]  Don't be taken in by them.
[02:51:59.547 --> 02:52:01.869]  Don't be taken in by anybody that supports them.
[02:52:02.209 --> 02:52:11.837]  And if you see BLM, whether it's on a football match or a cricket match, you know, please tell the organisers to drop this corrupt organisation.
[02:52:15.307 --> 02:52:17.076]  There you have Nigel Farage, and again.
[02:52:17.774 --> 02:52:24.558]  Premier League footballers in England are still taking a knee for BLM before all their games.
[02:52:25.079 --> 02:52:45.492]  Some of them are just standing there and applauding, some of them don't know what to do, but some of them are still performing this act of subservience, obedience to the BLM narrative, despite the fact that the entire narrative, the entire motivation behind the organisation, being a corrupt Ponzi scheme, is revealed more and more every single day.
[02:52:46.372 --> 02:52:49.838]   Meanwhile, Breitbart reports a new flag already.
[02:52:50.378 --> 02:52:56.441]  Woke London Mayor Sadiq Khan unveils new LGBTQ plus flag for IDAHOBIT.
[02:52:56.681 --> 02:52:57.622]  Whatever the hell that is.
[02:52:57.982 --> 02:53:07.026]  London Mayor Sadiq Khan has apparently unveiled a new version of the LGBTQ plus pride flag for International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia and Biphobia.
[02:53:07.327 --> 02:53:07.907]  IDAHOBIT.
[02:53:08.307 --> 02:53:32.275]   That seems like a Not a day, it seems like every single week they have some kind of event to mark the great oppressed downtrodden movement that is LGBT, supported by every major corporation, every major government, the entertainment industry, the music industry, supported by judges who will punish people for offending the LGBT community.
[02:53:33.175 --> 02:53:39.977]   But now they've added more colours To the Pride flag, yes, if you could believe that that was even physically possible.
[02:53:40.597 --> 02:53:44.880]  They already added all the trans colours to the flag a few years ago.
[02:53:45.360 --> 02:53:49.082]  Well now they've added hot pink to symbolise women.
[02:53:49.422 --> 02:53:55.566]  Apparently now just women in general are part of LGBT movement, whether they're LGBT or not.
[02:53:56.467 --> 02:54:01.870]  And they've added something else to include non-binary people.
[02:54:02.774 --> 02:54:11.861]  Black, brown and queer people, that was already included in the previous version, and also two spirit people, and God knows whoever else!
[02:54:12.561 --> 02:54:19.446]  They've released a 50 pence coin, the Royal Mint, because this, again, group is so downtrodden and underrepresented.
[02:54:20.267 --> 02:54:28.133]  Their flag literally flies over government buildings in central London because they're so downtrodden and underrepresented.
[02:54:29.088 --> 02:54:32.990]  And now Disney is joining in on the carnival too!
[02:54:33.810 --> 02:54:46.956]  Of course, Disney appealing to children, they've now launched a new line of LGBT clothing, despite the fact that their favorability ratings have completely collapsed because of their endorsement of this entire woke agenda.
[02:54:48.024 --> 02:54:53.709]  Disney said, we stand in solidarity with our LGBTQI plus community everywhere.
[02:54:53.749 --> 02:54:56.211]  They've left out some letters there, pretty bigoted of them.
[02:54:56.731 --> 02:54:59.533]  Haven't included the two-spirit people or the women.
[02:55:00.894 --> 02:55:07.299]  In show of solidarity, Disney introduces new LGBTQ plus clothing line for young children and babies.
[02:55:08.801 --> 02:55:27.718]   Because inducting children into Now, whatever you believe about the moral aspects of it, a lifestyle that provably leads to mass depression rates and suicide of gays, transgenders, go and look up the figures, that's really healthy to promote that to children, isn't it?
[02:55:28.199 --> 02:55:44.280]   Again, kids shouldn't be exposed to any kind of sexuality whatsoever, but when they're exposed to the sexuality that leads to misery, suicide and depression by Disney, A corporation that exists to basically entertain children, to a great extent.
[02:55:45.060 --> 02:55:46.921]  No wonder people have a problem with that.
[02:55:46.961 --> 02:55:58.924]  But somebody who did have a problem with LGBT movement, because it's so downtrodden and oppressed, is a man in Florida who did a burnout on an LGBT coloured crosswalk.
[02:55:59.224 --> 02:56:05.426]  Yes, because he offended the woke mob, the LGBT community, who are so downtrodden and oppressed.
[02:56:06.448 --> 02:56:12.129]  Zero Hedge reports Florida judge orders Vandal to write 25 pages of LGBT fiction.
[02:56:12.590 --> 02:56:14.610]  Yes, he has to doth his cap.
[02:56:14.970 --> 02:56:21.112]  He has to prove his ideological subservience to the agenda because they're so downtrodden and oppressed.
[02:56:21.792 --> 02:56:34.258]   By writing a LGBT fiction based on the false premise that Gay Pulse nightclub shooter Omar Mateen deliberately targeted the LGBT community.
[02:56:34.418 --> 02:56:35.939]  As we know, he didn't.
[02:56:36.279 --> 02:56:46.882]  It was a generalised attack for US military interventions in the Middle East, but now this guy has got to write a complete fiction in ideological subservience because he dared to a burnout on a coloured crosswalk.
[02:56:46.982 --> 02:56:47.462]  That's it.
[02:56:47.682 --> 02:56:48.503]  War Room is next.
[02:56:48.442 --> 02:56:59.242]  Don't go away.
[02:56:59.790 --> 02:57:04.875]  We've had a huge, huge effect when it comes to the fight against the globalists.
[02:57:05.896 --> 02:57:07.198]  And we've changed the world together.

[02:57:19.679 --> 02:57:38.164]  But now because of supply chain breakdowns and now because of all the Democratic Party-funded lawsuits and the slanted nature of those attacks, we are maxed out and pushed up against a wall, just like America is pushed up against a wall.
[02:57:38.484 --> 02:57:45.384]   And we're being bullied, we're being brutalized by the special interests that want to get through us To be able to get to you.
[02:57:45.464 --> 02:57:54.272]  So if we put today's live show headline up on screen for TV viewers and ask the question, did Alex Jones Infowars declare bankruptcy?
[02:57:55.213 --> 02:57:56.254]  Tune in and learn the truth.
[02:57:56.374 --> 02:58:22.894]   If you scroll down in that live show feed today, you'll find a subsection that's on InfowarsStore.com, where when you click on it, it takes you to a subpage And InfoWarsTore.com, where you can make a $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 one-time donation, or you can sign up for a recurring donation cancel any time.

[02:58:32.260 --> 02:58:35.942]  And I'm not talking to regular listeners that have supported us over the years and done a great job.
[02:58:36.202 --> 02:58:51.739]   I'm talking to new listeners or occasional listeners You need to understand, this is a serious situation we're in and you need to put skin in the game financially to keep operations on the air like InfoWars.
[02:58:52.199 --> 02:58:59.741]  Think of the millions of people that learned about Ivermectin and Zinc and Vitamin D and Hydroxychloroquine alone from this show.
[02:59:00.101 --> 02:59:04.482]  Think about the pedophile drag queen story times that have been exposed and stopped by this broadcast.
[02:59:05.282 --> 02:59:10.206]  Think about our border reports exposing the human smuggling that triggered congressional investigations.
[02:59:10.987 --> 02:59:13.509]  Think about our anti-war reporting.
[02:59:13.629 --> 02:59:18.813]  Think about our 9-11 in Bohemian Grove and our reporting on the globalist and the occult.
[02:59:19.093 --> 02:59:26.719]  I mean, to try to list our exposure of fluoride in the water and atrazine and the attack on our children with the whole transgender cult.
[02:59:27.360 --> 02:59:32.424]  Think about everything we've been through together and just imagine Infowars not being there.
