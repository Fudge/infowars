[00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:00.791]  It's here.
[00:00:01.774 --> 00:00:03.258]  We all live to see it.
[00:00:04.762 --> 00:00:05.845]  In the year 2022, racing towards 2030.
[00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.872]  The New World Order's agenda to end free societies worldwide and establish a cashless society worldwide.
[00:00:15.912 --> 00:00:32.537]  Dictatorship to carry out the forced depopulation of 90% and those that live will be forced to become cyborg transhumanist in the official statements by the Bilderberg Group's public spokesperson Klaus Schwab and his high priest Yuval Harari.
[00:00:33.878 --> 00:00:34.558]  Unbelievable.
[00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:43.917]  Trudeau, and we're going to play the clip coming up next segment, said that he wants a dictatorship.
[00:00:44.637 --> 00:01:07.322]   And Klaus Schwab said, we'll play that clip, that Trudeau, Justin Trudeau, whose father admired dictators and he says he admires dictatorships and dictators and basic dictatorships, is now moving to ban the sale of any type of semi-automatic or handgun And then, of course, confiscate is the next phase.
[00:01:07.402 --> 00:01:14.107]  It's an exact formula that they have followed in other Commonwealth countries around the world, and Canada is not really independent.
[00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:17.450]  It's under the Governor General of the British Empire.
[00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:28.643]   This is all part of the defanging And the domestication of the people of the world so that we will not resist while we are forcibly depopulated.
[00:01:28.943 --> 00:01:31.525]  And that, my friends, is the rest of the story.
[00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:32.246]  We're going to come back.
[00:01:33.006 --> 00:01:34.588]  More on the Canadian gun ban.
[00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:40.353]  Biden has let slip their plan for guns here, banning the ammunition in calibers.
[00:01:41.013 --> 00:01:42.113]  Not just guns now.
[00:01:42.813 --> 00:01:47.935]  It's all coming up on this special emergency transmission.
[00:01:48.235 --> 00:01:50.375]  The last day of May 2022.
[00:01:50.755 --> 00:01:52.456]  Stay with us and share the links.
[00:01:52.616 --> 00:01:53.816]  Banned dot video.
[00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:55.356]  Banned dot video.
[00:01:55.957 --> 00:01:57.057]  Newswars dot com.
[00:01:57.077 --> 00:02:03.038]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:02:02.878 --> 00:02:13.236]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:14.236]  Massive inflation.
[00:02:14.292 --> 00:02:15.253]  Exploding crime.
[00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:17.034]  Collapsing borders.
[00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.920]  Announcements of future lockdowns.
[00:02:24.042 --> 00:02:26.064]  World IDs to even leave your home.
[00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:29.107]  Forced injection with GMO.
[00:02:30.768 --> 00:02:32.210]  Nanotech filled poison.
[00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:33.832]  And of course...
[00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:44.428]  The United Nations' unitary agenda of disarming any civilian population on Earth so that the state has a monopoly of power.
[00:02:45.595 --> 00:02:51.740]  That's where we are in the year 2022, on this May 31st, Tuesday transmission.
[00:02:52.201 --> 00:03:09.976]  Here he is, the puppet leader, obviously stole the last election, fresh off of banning protests and declaring martial law, announcing the most draconian gun control ever seen in North America, ahead of total confiscation, following the same model of New Zealand, the UK, and Australia.
[00:03:11.547 --> 00:03:18.372]  We're introducing legislation to implement a national freeze on handgun ownership.
[00:03:19.612 --> 00:03:30.339]  What this means is that it will no longer be possible to buy, sell, transfer, or import handguns anywhere in Canada.
[00:03:31.881 --> 00:03:35.163]  In other words, we're capping the market for handguns.
[00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:40.077]  Look at the cultists.
[00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:42.322]  All triple-backs wearing their masks.
[00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:44.007]  Man, this is a cult.
[00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:45.731]  The Nazi armbands?
[00:03:45.771 --> 00:03:46.392]  They wore masks.
[00:03:50.239 --> 00:04:03.542]  As a further part of this new legislation, we're also fighting gun smuggling and trafficking by increasing maximum criminal penalties and providing more tools for law enforcement to investigate firearm crimes.
[00:04:04.423 --> 00:04:12.225]  And we'll require the permanent alteration of long gun magazines so they can never hold more than five rounds.
[00:04:13.405 --> 00:04:19.291]  These are actions that doctors, experts, and chiefs of police have been calling for for years.
[00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:22.233]  And we're acting on their advice.
[00:04:23.895 --> 00:04:30.021]  I also want to thank the advocates, many of whom are here today for your tireless efforts.
[00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:33.204]  The people guarding this criminal won't have any produced magazines.
[00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.454]  I want to recognize that, and on behalf of all Canadians, I want to thank you for your strength.
[00:04:46.336 --> 00:04:55.483]  This is a guy that said, right after he got elected a few years ago, the first time, he stole the last election, evidence is overwhelming, that he wanted a dictatorship like China, and that's what he admires.
[00:04:56.744 --> 00:04:59.225]  He's made all these other statements about how you shouldn't have free speech.
[00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:06.471]  And so, the long, dark night for Canada begins.
[00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:25.369]  Even people that I've known for decades that I would call liberals 20 years ago, like Joe Rogan, are now 100% pro-Second Amendment, and they get that when you take the guns from the general public, only the state and the criminals have them, and horrors invariably follow.
[00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:28.751]  Most of the crime in this country is in Democrat-run blue cities.
[00:05:28.791 --> 00:05:31.072]  We know it's three to five times on average.
[00:05:31.963 --> 00:05:32.664]  Any other area.
[00:05:33.324 --> 00:05:34.505]  That's the same thing in Canada.
[00:05:35.206 --> 00:05:39.469]  In the cities, you have a bunch of disarmed sheep and criminals running around feeding on them.
[00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.612]  In the rural areas, almost no crime because people are still armed.
[00:05:43.232 --> 00:05:44.133]  But not for long.
[00:05:44.373 --> 00:05:45.634]  They follow an exact formula.
[00:05:46.035 --> 00:05:49.498]  Let's go out to break with Joe Rogan laying out the basic facts we all know.
[00:05:51.451 --> 00:05:55.915]  I wrote this thing once that I said this country has a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem.
[00:05:56.895 --> 00:05:57.936]  And that's what it is.
[00:05:59.097 --> 00:06:00.658]  There's so many guns.
[00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.540]  There's more guns than there are people.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.962]  I don't think it's a gun situation.
[00:06:05.422 --> 00:06:11.527]  And I don't think you can change the fact that there's... And I don't think it's wise to take the guns away from the people and leave all the power to the government.
[00:06:11.567 --> 00:06:14.149]  We see how they are even with an armed populace.
[00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:19.709]  they still have a tendency towards totalitarianism.
[00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:22.908]   And the more increased power and control you have over people,
[00:06:22.908 --> 00:06:25.149]  the easier it is for them to do what they do.
[00:06:25.149 --> 00:06:27.709]   And it's a natural inclination when you are a person in power
[00:06:27.709 --> 00:06:30.669]  to try to hold more power and acquire more power.
[00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:34.669]   And it's never, there's never an inclination to give more power back to the people,
[00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:36.669]  to give more freedoms back to the people.
[00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:38.928]  Freedoms lost are rarely regained.
[00:06:38.928 --> 00:06:42.789]  Perfectly said, common sense, and it's spreading fast.
[00:06:42.815 --> 00:06:43.196]  Stay with us.
[00:06:43.976 --> 00:06:58.828]  Trudeau's father, who was also the leader of Canada at one point, said that he admired Fidel Castro and Mao Zedong, and traveled there to be taught at the knee of Mao Zedong.
[00:06:59.909 --> 00:07:04.544]   And his son, when he was first getting elected, He clearly stole the last election.
[00:07:04.584 --> 00:07:08.746]  Trudeau said that he admires dictatorship in government.
[00:07:09.046 --> 00:07:10.646]  When asked, what do you admire most?
[00:07:11.387 --> 00:07:12.207]  He wasn't joking.
[00:07:12.247 --> 00:07:17.509]  He said, I admire China's basic dictatorship.
[00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:27.894]  And that's why you see Canada mirroring much of what communist China has done in the last 30 months with the whole COVID power grab working through the World Economic Forum.
[00:07:28.374 --> 00:07:29.555]  And that's what's most important.
[00:07:31.274 --> 00:07:51.143]  Klaus Schwab has openly said, we've played the clips here, that Trudeau is the model of the World Economic Forum's quote, penetration of governments, and that they control half the cabinets of the world's governments.
[00:07:52.623 --> 00:08:01.316]   And then in some cases even more, where they totally control it, in the case of The Canadian government.
[00:08:02.837 --> 00:08:15.267]  The Deputy Prime Minister is the same lady that's on the board of the World Economic Forum and has been announcing plans for censorship, gun confiscation, you name it.
[00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:26.875]  And that's why Trudeau has now come out and said, we're freezing all handgun sales and all sales of firearms that can hold more than five rounds of ammunition.
[00:08:27.884 --> 00:08:37.231]  That's the exact blueprint of the UK 30 years ago taking the guns, the exact blueprint of Australia 20 years ago, and New Zealand 20 years ago taking the guns.
[00:08:38.252 --> 00:08:50.202]  First they ban the sale, then they register everything, then they ban everything down to single-shot rifles that you've got to have special licenses for if you live on a farm.
[00:08:52.163 --> 00:08:57.400]   Of course, Mexico has a crime rate Three to five times or even higher in some areas of the U.S.
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:01.583]  They have a total gun ban for their citizens, though their citizens still secretly own guns.
[00:09:02.243 --> 00:09:11.069]  Those are some of the only areas that are pretty low in crime is in rural areas, where the local farmers band together and stand up against the cartels and the corrupt governments.
[00:09:13.131 --> 00:09:18.294]  So it's here, and GhostGuns.com on Twitter put together a nice little boil down.
[00:09:19.815 --> 00:09:21.417]  Mass shootings are tragedies.
[00:09:21.837 --> 00:09:25.249]   Do not fall for their Quote, solutions.
[00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:28.151]  Number of people killed by gun violence.
[00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:29.711]  Virginia Tech, 33.
[00:09:31.312 --> 00:09:36.674]  Number killed by communist violence after gun confiscation in China, 65 million.
[00:09:37.414 --> 00:09:38.314]  Sandy Hook, 28.
[00:09:39.275 --> 00:09:42.256]  Russia, after government confiscates guns, 25 million.
[00:09:42.276 --> 00:09:42.456]  Uvalde, 22.
[00:09:42.516 --> 00:09:44.297]  Cambodia, 2 million.
[00:09:48.735 --> 00:09:49.035]  U.T.
[00:09:49.055 --> 00:09:49.435]  Tower, 18.
[00:09:50.576 --> 00:09:51.996]  North Korea, 2 million.
[00:09:52.537 --> 00:09:52.997]  Parkland, 17.
[00:09:53.257 --> 00:09:55.458]  Ethiopia, 1.7 million.
[00:09:56.198 --> 00:09:58.899]  Columbia, Columbine, 15.
[00:09:58.939 --> 00:10:01.420]  Afghanistan, 1.5 million.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:01.760]  Santa Fe, 10.
[00:10:01.659 --> 00:10:09.578]   Afghanistan 1.5 million, Santa Fe 10, Eastern Block 1 million.
[00:10:09.578 --> 00:10:13.219]  And it goes on with what happens after the guns are confiscated.
[00:10:13.219 --> 00:10:19.100]   And that is a very conservative analysis of this, but it's true.
[00:10:19.103 --> 00:10:34.829]  And that's exactly what Joe Rogan and myself and anybody else that's being honest is saying, is that you have a corrupt system that wants to defund the police, that wants to take your guns while they have security out the yin-yang and own guns themselves.
[00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:37.587]  This is their desire for tyranny.
[00:10:37.607 --> 00:10:41.931]  And remember, Trudeau said, you're not allowed to have your protest, they're terrorists.
[00:10:42.952 --> 00:10:47.616]  And he made all these statements about how he's signing everybody onto Agenda 2030 to cut off the carbon.
[00:10:48.276 --> 00:10:51.880]  He made all these announcements about, you don't own your body and we're going to make you take these shots.
[00:10:53.121 --> 00:10:55.963]  And wouldn't let Canadians travel outside their country, even if they had.
[00:10:56.736 --> 00:10:58.736]  Had the shots that don't work.
[00:10:58.736 --> 00:11:01.736]  And then his basic dictatorship comments.
[00:11:01.736 --> 00:11:03.736]  They're trying to find it.
[00:11:03.736 --> 00:11:06.736]   We played a compilation back during the whole trucker strike
[00:11:06.736 --> 00:11:10.736]   that just had some of the insane things that this guy had to say.
[00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:16.736]   But you ask, why do they sound like a cartoon character from a cartoon depicting a dictator?
[00:11:17.255 --> 00:11:18.876]  Why does this read like 1984?
[00:11:19.496 --> 00:11:25.519]  Because it's happened lots of other times in history, and tyrannies are more common than free nations.
[00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:28.060]  That's why America was so special.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.501]  A lot of people came here.
[00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:34.845]  Everybody else in the world lusted after freedom because they never had a shot at it.
[00:11:35.185 --> 00:11:36.226]  No economic freedom.
[00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:37.747]  No freedom of mobility.
[00:11:38.207 --> 00:11:39.648]  No freedom to choose their own career.
[00:11:39.969 --> 00:11:41.310]  No freedom to defend themselves.
[00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:47.314]  A corrupt bureaucracies ruling over the people.
[00:11:47.414 --> 00:11:48.015]  Feudalism.
[00:11:51.337 --> 00:12:16.152]   And now that entire The system that our ancestors have been fighting for, Europeans particularly, since Magna Carta in 1215, and common law paid for in blood so that you would have basic rights, is all being flushed down the toilet very quickly, and rights taken are seldom regained or returned.
[00:12:16.671 --> 00:12:24.031]  That is a well-known maxim.
[00:12:24.031 --> 00:12:27.471]  Rights lost are seldom regained.
[00:12:27.471 --> 00:12:33.550]  And we have a racing to the finish line by these tyrants.
[00:12:33.717 --> 00:12:50.045]  A racing to the finish line to bring in a world ID that will track and control and monitor and tell you what you can buy and what you can't buy with programmable money and a social credit score and a universal basic income because we're being made obsolete.
[00:12:50.325 --> 00:12:53.087]  And they admit the plan is to lock you in your house.
[00:12:54.813 --> 00:12:57.035]  And make you live and work through the metaverse.
[00:12:58.336 --> 00:13:03.761]  They're pushing humans out of the workplace to bring in robots for control, not as an innovation.
[00:13:05.062 --> 00:13:07.965]  Here's some of what the dictator, because he clearly stole the election up there.
[00:13:09.506 --> 00:13:12.529]  Probably got elected the first time, but the evidence is overwhelming, stole the second one.
[00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:16.412]  That snap election last year during the whole, quote, pandemic.
[00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:17.913]  The plan-demic.
[00:13:18.353 --> 00:13:22.353]  So here's some of the dictator to the north.
[00:13:22.353 --> 00:13:29.353]  [Music]
[00:13:29.353 --> 00:13:37.353]   The small fringe minority of people who are on their way to Ottawa
[00:13:37.353 --> 00:13:43.353]   or who are holding unacceptable views that they're expressing.
[00:13:43.353 --> 00:13:45.933]  (upbeat music)
[00:13:44.984 --> 00:14:02.819]  Do not represent the views of Canadians who have been there for each other, who know that following the science and stepping up to protect each other is the best way to continue to ensure our freedoms, our rights, our values as a country.
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:09.885]  We are not intimidated by those who hurl insults and abuse at small business workers.
[00:14:10.874 --> 00:14:13.475]  And steal food from the homeless.
[00:14:14.455 --> 00:14:18.416]  We won't give in to those who fly racist flags.
[00:14:19.376 --> 00:14:26.317]  We won't cave to those who engage in vandalism or dishonor the memory of our veterans.
[00:14:26.917 --> 00:14:30.958]  So to those responsible for this behavior, it needs to stop.
[00:14:31.258 --> 00:14:49.175]   The level of admiration I actually have for China Because their, you know, basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime and say we need to go green as fast as we need to start, you know, investing in solar.
[00:14:49.195 --> 00:14:55.279]  I mean, there is a flexibility that I know Stephen Harper must dream about of having a dictatorship that he could do everything he wanted.
[00:14:55.299 --> 00:14:58.181]  That I find quite interesting.
[00:14:58.761 --> 00:15:11.790]  Regardless of the fact that we are attacking your fundamental rights or limiting your fundamental rights, and the Charter says that was wrong, we're still going to go ahead and do with it.
[00:15:12.571 --> 00:15:24.540]  The federal government has invoked the Emergencies Act to supplement provincial and territorial capacity to address the blockades and occupations.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.001]  We went after the funding.
[00:15:27.026 --> 00:15:30.707]  Our efforts combined with the city's efforts eliminated the GoFundMe.
[00:15:31.287 --> 00:15:34.628]  Ten million dollars are no longer accessible to the demonstrators.
[00:15:35.088 --> 00:15:44.730]  There are other funding avenues that we continue to aggressively go after through intelligence, information, coordination with financial institutions, and all three levels of government.
[00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:51.092]  We are broadening the scope of Canada's anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules.
[00:15:51.932 --> 00:15:58.017]  So that they cover crowdfunding platforms and the payment service providers they use.
[00:15:58.177 --> 00:16:03.200]  We will be relentless in pursuing the funding that has enabled this demonstration to continue to this point.
[00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:11.627]  These changes cover all forms of transactions including digital assets such as cryptocurrencies.
[00:16:12.387 --> 00:16:13.508]  I want to be very clear.
[00:16:14.489 --> 00:16:27.742]  The scope of these measures will be time-limited, geographically targeted, as well as reasonable and proportionate to the threats they are meant to address.
[00:16:28.703 --> 00:16:37.070]  The Emergencies Act will be used to strengthen and support law enforcement agencies at all levels across the country.
[00:16:37.971 --> 00:16:46.785]  This is about keeping Canadians safe, protecting people's jobs, and restoring confidence in our institutions.
[00:16:47.426 --> 00:16:47.966]  As of today.
[00:16:49.045 --> 00:16:59.390]  A bank or other financial service provider will be able to immediately freeze or suspend an account without a court order.
[00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.712]  Justin Trudeau, I mean, I thought he was kind of a cool guy.
[00:17:02.732 --> 00:17:05.273]  And I started to read what he said.
[00:17:05.814 --> 00:17:07.034]  This is a couple of weeks ago.
[00:17:07.114 --> 00:17:11.917]  He was or maybe this is September, but he was talking about people who are not vaccinated.
[00:17:13.072 --> 00:17:14.533]  He said, they don't believe in science.
[00:17:14.573 --> 00:17:16.735]  They're often misogynistic, often racist.
[00:17:16.956 --> 00:17:17.616]  No, they're not.
[00:17:17.696 --> 00:17:19.398]  That was not smart of him at all.
[00:17:19.478 --> 00:17:19.758]  Right.
[00:17:19.798 --> 00:17:21.840]  He said, but they take up space.
[00:17:23.141 --> 00:17:26.724]  And with that, we have to make a choice in terms of a leader as a country.
[00:17:27.145 --> 00:17:28.766]  Do we tolerate these people?
[00:17:28.846 --> 00:17:29.987]  It's like, tolerate?
[00:17:29.826 --> 00:17:31.826]  Dude, now you do sound like him.
[00:17:31.826 --> 00:17:47.826]  [Music]
[00:17:47.826 --> 00:17:49.826]  It's here!
[00:17:49.614 --> 00:17:51.097]  We all live to see it!
[00:17:52.599 --> 00:17:53.680]  In the year 2022, racing towards 2030!
[00:17:57.523 --> 00:18:03.706]  The New World Order's agenda to end free societies worldwide and establish a cashless society worldwide.
[00:18:03.746 --> 00:18:12.490]  Dictatorship to carry out the forced depopulation of 90% and those that live will be forced to become cyborg transhumanist.
[00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:20.373]  And the official statements by the Bilderberg Group's public spokesperson Klaus Schwab and his high priest Yuval Harari.
[00:18:21.714 --> 00:18:22.394]  Unbelievable.
[00:18:24.028 --> 00:18:31.751]  Trudeau, and we're going to play the clip coming up next segment, said that he wants a dictatorship.
[00:18:32.472 --> 00:18:51.140]  And Klaus Schwab said, we'll play that clip, that Trudeau, Justin Trudeau, whose father admired dictators and he says he admires dictatorships and dictators and basic dictatorships, is now moving to ban the sale of any type of semi-automatic or handgun.
[00:18:52.332 --> 00:18:55.174]  And then, of course, confiscate is the next phase.
[00:18:55.234 --> 00:19:00.378]  It's an exact formula that they have followed in other Commonwealth countries around the world.
[00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:01.940]  And Canada is not really independent.
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.302]  It's under the Governor General of the British Empire.
[00:19:07.244 --> 00:19:11.768]  Incredible information to be living in these days.
[00:19:11.828 --> 00:19:14.450]  And here are two extremely important graphs that I'll describe.
[00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.872]  Radio listeners, TV viewers can see these.
[00:19:18.288 --> 00:19:27.954]  Figure one, this is from the federal government's own statistics, is the total amount of overdose deaths.
[00:19:27.994 --> 00:19:29.255]  And of course, they're a lot higher than this.
[00:19:29.275 --> 00:19:30.316]  Not all of them get reported.
[00:19:31.037 --> 00:19:36.940]  But you can see starting in 1999, it was 18,000, steadily climbing.
[00:19:38.882 --> 00:19:40.923]  As prescription illegal drugs both flood.
[00:19:41.483 --> 00:19:44.205]  And by the year 2020, we haven't got numbers in about two years yet.
[00:19:44.706 --> 00:19:45.686]  It's at 91,000.
[00:19:46.087 --> 00:19:47.167]  The latest numbers just came out.
[00:19:47.528 --> 00:19:49.914]   It's over 110,000 a year.
[00:19:49.954 --> 00:19:51.115]  So, 110,000 in 2021.
[00:19:51.175 --> 00:19:51.235]  91,799 in 2020.
[00:19:51.395 --> 00:19:52.696]  Quite the acceleration straight up.
[00:19:53.756 --> 00:19:55.737]  Now let's compare that to mass shooting deaths.
[00:19:55.557 --> 00:20:07.596]  in 2021, 91,799 in 2020, quite the acceleration straight up.
[00:20:07.596 --> 00:20:12.756]  Now let's compare that to mass shooting deaths.
[00:20:12.756 --> 00:20:20.676]  The lowest year was 2002.
[00:20:20.676 --> 00:20:24.116]   Nearly zero it says here on the graph from the FBI's own numbers.
[00:20:24.116 --> 00:20:34.116]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:20:25.958 --> 00:20:27.798]  The worst year was Vegas.
[00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:35.100]  You can see that at a hundred and eighteen people.
[00:20:36.841 --> 00:20:39.922]  You can see as it goes then off the graph there.
[00:20:41.943 --> 00:20:43.503]  So a hundred and eighteen people.
[00:20:45.424 --> 00:20:47.144]  One hundred and eighteen people.
[00:20:49.425 --> 00:20:49.845]  Humans.
[00:20:54.491 --> 00:21:06.295]  Versus over 100,000 people in the year 2021.
[00:21:09.536 --> 00:21:12.737]  We don't have numbers obviously for this year yet.
[00:21:15.658 --> 00:21:16.418]  So what's bigger?
[00:21:16.478 --> 00:21:16.959]  What's bigger?
[00:21:17.339 --> 00:21:20.820]  Drug overdoses or mass shootings?
[00:21:23.117 --> 00:21:25.679]  But I use this analogy because it's the perfect one.
[00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:49.214]  Jaws came out in 1972 and for five years straight, it cut the amount of people on the East and West Coast going and staying in little hotels and beach houses to go fishing and swimming because people saw Jaws, made by Steven Spielberg, great movie, totally unrealistic, and they thought that Jaws would eat them and kill them.
[00:21:50.578 --> 00:21:52.238]  So they put national ads out.
[00:21:52.418 --> 00:21:54.179]  You can type it into Google and click images.
[00:21:55.819 --> 00:21:59.340]  Ads telling people it's safe to go to the beach, that sharks won't eat them.
[00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.680]  And they would show the statistics.
[00:22:02.961 --> 00:22:06.661]  That, oh, only eight people died in the world of great white attacks.
[00:22:07.241 --> 00:22:07.962]  They would give the number.
[00:22:08.502 --> 00:22:09.702]  The average is about 12 a year.
[00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:14.263]  They'd say, it's safe, please come back to the beach.
[00:22:15.262 --> 00:22:18.623]  Now I'm not lessening the poor dead children and the evil act that happened.
[00:22:19.124 --> 00:22:21.745]  One child being executed for no reason is abhorrent.
[00:22:23.205 --> 00:22:25.326]  But the worst year in U.S.
[00:22:25.346 --> 00:22:37.191]  history of mass senseless shootings is 118 versus 100 plus thousand for drug overdoses and it's only climbing.
[00:22:41.273 --> 00:22:41.853]  Think about that.
[00:22:45.009 --> 00:22:52.072]  Think about that long and hard and let that sink in and realize how nonsensical all of this is.
[00:22:54.413 --> 00:23:14.063]  And ask yourselves why we are so nonsensical and how we've been trained to be so vapid and shallow that all over the news we're told and children's science shows say there's no difference between men and women and we have the same chromosomes, which isn't true.
[00:23:16.141 --> 00:23:17.482]  And that men can have babies.
[00:23:18.502 --> 00:23:22.825]  And that, oh, two women got pregnant from another woman in a jail or a prison.
[00:23:23.446 --> 00:23:25.187]  Or five women got pregnant from another woman.
[00:23:26.107 --> 00:23:27.628]  It is the murder of logic.
[00:23:28.869 --> 00:23:31.871]  It is the murder of common sense.
[00:23:32.291 --> 00:23:40.016]  And it's the same reason that many beach towns for the years after, in fact, they never fully recovered.
[00:23:44.096 --> 00:23:52.561]  It's the reason so many beach towns went bankrupt because of one Hollywood movie and the copycat movies that got made.
[00:23:55.522 --> 00:23:57.384]  That's the same thing with these mass shootings.
[00:23:59.505 --> 00:24:03.247]  They probably made, what, 20 movies after Jaws?
[00:24:04.327 --> 00:24:05.588]  They made four or five Jaws.
[00:24:05.628 --> 00:24:09.430]  They made a bunch of others where piranhas are eating people and everything else.
[00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:12.132]  And folks stopped swimming.
[00:24:13.979 --> 00:24:18.923]  In the ocean, because they thought Jaws was going to eat them, and it's the same thing here.
[00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:28.530]  And then the more security, and the more police, and the more everything, and then still it happens, because the media hypes it, and that's why it's going up.
[00:24:28.971 --> 00:24:30.632]  That's why mass shootings are going up.
[00:24:31.092 --> 00:24:46.780]   Still incredibly rare, but the more they hype them, the same way you can hype people to not swim, or go to the beach because you're scared of Jaws, Even most adults I know, I'll say, hey, let's swim out to that buoy, 200 yards.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.860]  Oh, I don't want to do that.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.680]  They're the sharks.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:57.680]   And then of course there's something that kills way more than...
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.680]  drug overdoses.
[00:25:01.343 --> 00:25:07.484]  It's estimated that a quarter million people die a year of hospital infections alone.
[00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:10.981]  Then you add hospital mistakes, it's another $80,000, $90,000.
[00:25:11.521 --> 00:25:18.527]  You're getting up there close to $400,000 debt.
[00:25:18.828 --> 00:25:20.269]  Oh, what about automobile accidents?
[00:25:20.309 --> 00:25:21.290]  Hundreds of thousands a year.
[00:25:22.171 --> 00:25:24.413]  Do we need to ban cars because it's a dangerous thing?
[00:25:26.127 --> 00:25:31.150]  Living is dangerous and the nanny state wants to lock you in your house in the metaverse.
[00:25:31.691 --> 00:25:45.580]  The World Economic Forum announced it to lower your carbon footprint so that clean robots can live your life for you and so you won't even know how to go even buy your own groceries, much less grow your own food.
[00:25:47.202 --> 00:25:57.633]   This is all part of the defanging And the domestication of the people of the world so that we will not resist while we are forcibly depopulated.
[00:25:57.933 --> 00:26:00.494]  And that, my friends, is the rest of the story.
[00:26:00.534 --> 00:26:03.555]  We're going to come back more on the Canadian gun ban.
[00:26:03.995 --> 00:26:09.317]  Biden has let slip their plan for guns here, banning the ammunition in calibers.
[00:26:09.997 --> 00:26:19.361]  Not just guns now, it's all coming up on this special emergency transmission, the last day of May, 2022.
[00:26:19.741 --> 00:26:21.442]  Stay with us and share the links.
[00:26:21.602 --> 00:26:22.802]  Band.video.
[00:26:23.183 --> 00:26:24.323]  Band.video.
[00:26:24.943 --> 00:26:25.964]  Newswars.com.
[00:26:26.929 --> 00:26:40.034]  I have to say, when I mention now names like Mrs. Merkel, even Vladimir Putin and so on, they all have been young global leaders of the World Economic Forum.
[00:26:42.975 --> 00:26:55.808]  What we are very proud of now is the young generation like Prime Minister Trudeau, President of Argentina and so on, that we penetrate the cabinets.
[00:26:56.449 --> 00:27:16.462]   So yesterday I was at a reception for Prime Minister Trudeau and I would know that half of this cabinet, or even more half of this cabinet, are actually young global leaders of the world economy.
[00:27:17.082 --> 00:27:19.223]  And that's true in Argentina, too.
[00:27:19.543 --> 00:27:19.764]  Wow.
[00:27:20.004 --> 00:27:20.244]  Sorry.
[00:27:20.464 --> 00:27:21.804]  That's true in Argentina as well.
[00:27:22.225 --> 00:27:25.786]  It's true in Argentina, and it's true in France now.
[00:27:25.966 --> 00:27:49.765]   I'm with the President, who is a young global leader, but what is important for And last Monday, from Geneva, Switzerland, the newly minted leader of the U.N., Klaus Schwab, under treaty, as the two organizations publicly merged, same globalist created both organizations.
[00:27:50.825 --> 00:28:02.494]  Announced that they control the world and they control your governments, and Klaus Schwab is on record, it's even on his Wikipedia page with a link to his own site, saying they don't believe in democracy.
[00:28:02.935 --> 00:28:08.499]  They don't believe in people running their own countries, that they don't believe the stakeholders should be in control.
[00:28:08.839 --> 00:28:10.801]  That means a corporate dictatorship.
[00:28:13.003 --> 00:28:17.746]  It's so surreal to sit here and watch this authoritarian transformation.
[00:28:18.752 --> 00:28:25.195]  And to see the corporate media defend it, and to see classical so-called liberals become such fascists.
[00:28:26.555 --> 00:28:28.336]  But they're being paid to do so.
[00:28:29.217 --> 00:28:32.338]  The New World Order is making its big move.
[00:28:32.618 --> 00:28:36.039]  I want to show you in a moment a clip from Biden.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:37.840]  Yeah, there it is.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.902]  We capture the democratic institutions and structures.
[00:28:42.942 --> 00:28:43.783]  We capture them.
[00:28:45.323 --> 00:28:46.264]  We control them.
[00:28:47.139 --> 00:28:49.880]  The people will have no say, no free will.
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:51.081]  You want to hear the clips again?
[00:28:54.182 --> 00:28:56.063]  You do not own your body, we do.
[00:28:56.383 --> 00:28:57.504]  We will put chips in you.
[00:28:58.504 --> 00:29:00.705]  You will live in Medivac, not to leave home.
[00:29:00.725 --> 00:29:01.966]  These are quotes.
[00:29:04.507 --> 00:29:06.488]  Outrageously evil.
[00:29:06.748 --> 00:29:11.250]  Outrageously, fabulously, over-the-top dangerous.
[00:29:13.703 --> 00:29:28.011]  And now their minion, Justin Trudeau, who says he admires dictatorships, and wants a dictatorship for Canada, and who said people that hold unacceptable views, that don't want lockdowns, you will be arrested!
[00:29:29.992 --> 00:29:37.617]  And are we surprised that Pretty Boy is following the WEF's orders to set the example to take the guns?
[00:29:38.377 --> 00:29:43.474]   The Democratic Party The WEF, the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:29:44.254 --> 00:29:51.135]  They've all said in the last month, we must follow the directives and examples of the European Union when it comes to censorship.
[00:29:51.575 --> 00:29:52.735]  And they threatened Elon Musk.
[00:29:52.995 --> 00:29:54.256]  You go ahead and try to buy Twitter.
[00:29:54.476 --> 00:29:56.896]  We'll arrest you if you let people talk.
[00:29:59.057 --> 00:30:01.337]  We're not going down the road to tyranny.
[00:30:01.437 --> 00:30:02.457]  We have arrived.
[00:30:03.538 --> 00:30:04.618]  We're not almost there.
[00:30:04.738 --> 00:30:05.158]  We're here.
[00:30:06.127 --> 00:30:11.950]  And like quicksand, we're sinking into it faster and faster and faster.
[00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:13.451]  The good news is there's a global awakening.
[00:30:13.831 --> 00:30:15.512]  The good news is evil always falls.
[00:30:16.292 --> 00:30:22.515]  But ladies and gentlemen, this is going to get so bad if our leaders don't start identifying the takeover that's happening.
[00:30:23.075 --> 00:30:27.617]  And finally, some Republican leaders like Rand Paul and Ron DeSantis are doing that.
[00:30:29.378 --> 00:30:34.602]   But we better see A lot more of it, and we better see it fast.
[00:30:35.383 --> 00:30:37.084]  And we're not going to see it come from the top.
[00:30:37.144 --> 00:30:46.590]  It's going to come from the grassroots, calling your congressmen and women, going to their events, sending them information, calling talk radio, getting online and speaking up.
[00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:50.293]  You need to start your own Facebook show, your own YouTube show, until they ban you.
[00:30:51.093 --> 00:30:52.694]  You need to start your own independent sites.
[00:30:52.954 --> 00:30:59.537]  Everybody, whether you're a business owner or a preacher, need to start your own pro-freedom, anti-New World Order movement.
[00:30:59.957 --> 00:31:04.420]  And whether you get a thousand people to listen or a million, together we will defeat them.
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.321]  The answer is mobilizing the people.
[00:31:07.421 --> 00:31:11.823]  They would not be trying to censor and silence everyone if we were weak.
[00:31:12.424 --> 00:31:18.807]  They would not be doing all this outrageous stuff out in the open that is so classically bonafide totalitarian.
[00:31:20.729 --> 00:31:23.330]  If we didn't have power and if we couldn't stop them.
[00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:30.871]  The only way this can succeed is that if you advocate your authority and hand it over to these criminals.
[00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:38.333]  Now, I want to play a clip of Biden here in a moment where he tips his hand on the plan.
[00:31:38.353 --> 00:31:40.633]  And we know it's a formula that's been used around the world.
[00:31:41.734 --> 00:31:42.754]  We already know the formula.
[00:31:44.554 --> 00:31:49.256]  We're going to be laying it out here in a moment, but this is a formula or steps towards disarming you.
[00:31:49.636 --> 00:31:51.758]  And if you don't think they'll do it here, you're wrong.
[00:31:52.078 --> 00:32:02.523]  Let me say this very slowly to sink in to the board members of the NRA and others that listen to this show daily, who I know already understand this.
[00:32:03.423 --> 00:32:05.304]  But people like Ted Nugent, daily listener.
[00:32:08.265 --> 00:32:09.166]  Ted, you're a major leader.
[00:32:11.989 --> 00:32:21.733]  And Ted was asking me on the phone, I guess it was this Monday morning, how bad is it going to get?
[00:32:23.354 --> 00:32:26.135]  Because the American people aren't going to put up with gun confiscation.
[00:32:27.056 --> 00:32:28.576]  And I said, that's exactly the plan.
[00:32:32.358 --> 00:32:34.419]  They know it'll cause a civil war.
[00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:36.140]  That's why they're going to try it.
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:39.081]  They know they've already lost politically.
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:45.185]  That's why they're going to dictatorship with the illusion of freedom through staged elections.
[00:32:45.585 --> 00:32:46.726]  The Venezuelan model.
[00:32:47.547 --> 00:32:48.788]  The Joseph Stalin model.
[00:32:48.828 --> 00:32:49.588]  They had elections.
[00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:52.151]  But he said, I don't care who cast the ballot.
[00:32:53.412 --> 00:32:55.994]  All that matters is who counts the votes.
[00:32:57.635 --> 00:33:00.998]  And so we're at a very dangerous crossroads right now.
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:13.675]   And if you think things are bad now, ladies and gentlemen, They are not going to stop until 90% of us are dead, and that's their public goal, because they tell their collaborators, oh, we're still going to leave some people.
[00:33:14.155 --> 00:33:16.936]  Obviously, the idiots that go along with this are going to get killed, too.
[00:33:19.517 --> 00:33:25.080]  It was Julius Caesar that said, I love treason, but I hate traitors.
[00:33:26.621 --> 00:33:34.865]  And the rule is, the traitors that help bring down a society are the first people the new rulers kill.
[00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.971]  And we the people were the rulers to a certain extent for a while.
[00:33:40.492 --> 00:33:43.393]  That's all being swept away.
[00:33:43.453 --> 00:33:49.736]  So we're going to come back in a long segment of the hour and get into this Biden statement and give you some powerful examples.
[00:33:50.416 --> 00:33:51.157]  But I want to say this.
[00:33:51.737 --> 00:33:53.878]  There is a massive unprecedented attack.
[00:33:56.411 --> 00:34:00.333]  On free speech, as I was just saying, and InfoWars is the front lines.
[00:34:00.393 --> 00:34:01.213]  We are the heart.
[00:34:01.773 --> 00:34:02.574]  We are the brain.
[00:34:02.614 --> 00:34:04.314]  We are the soul of the human awakening.
[00:34:04.775 --> 00:34:07.236]  You are the heart, and the guts, and the mind, and the will.
[00:34:08.116 --> 00:34:09.437]  And thank you for standing with us.
[00:34:09.457 --> 00:34:10.237]  You know who you are.
[00:34:10.537 --> 00:34:21.662]  Those that have bought product, those that have spread the word, those that have prayed for us, those that have made donations in Bitcoin, thank you so much at InfoWars.com forward slash crypto and other cryptocurrencies.
[00:34:22.893 --> 00:34:28.915]  And we have a coin that we've already sold 65% of, and it's going to sell out very, very quickly.
[00:34:28.935 --> 00:34:37.957]  It's the third and final coin the founding member set at 1776coin.com or patriotcollectibles.com.
[00:34:39.378 --> 00:34:47.380]  And when you order it and leave your email, you will get a lot of special benefits and things into the future and new things we're going to be launching.
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.381]  So this is something very, very special.
[00:34:51.027 --> 00:34:51.948]  It's your last chance.
[00:34:51.988 --> 00:34:53.649]  There won't be any other founding member coins.
[00:34:54.630 --> 00:35:08.139]  To go to 1776coin.com and secure the second amendment coin that we designed six months ago, that was minted over a month ago, that was delivered... I guess on Monday we went to sell right when it got here.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.782]  And it's available now.
[00:35:12.562 --> 00:35:13.923]  I guess last Monday is what I meant to say.
[00:35:15.384 --> 00:35:17.166]  And so, the 1776 coin is here.
[00:35:20.362 --> 00:35:22.328]  And I want to thank Ollie that got the first two coins.
[00:35:23.711 --> 00:35:27.221]  This is the third and final Freeman Bear Arms on the front.
[00:35:28.564 --> 00:35:28.984]  On the back.
[00:35:29.524 --> 00:35:29.945]  On the front.
[00:35:30.445 --> 00:35:31.365]  Come and take it.
[00:35:31.985 --> 00:35:34.066]  It is powerful.
[00:35:34.746 --> 00:35:39.288]  1776coin.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:35:39.688 --> 00:35:40.669]  You are our boosters.
[00:35:40.789 --> 00:35:41.789]  You are our sponsors.
[00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:43.250]  The viewers and listeners like you.
[00:35:43.830 --> 00:35:44.710]  And you're changing the world.
[00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:46.431]  I want to thank you and I want to encourage everybody.
[00:35:46.771 --> 00:35:50.573]  Be part of this at 1776coin.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:35:50.633 --> 00:35:55.015]  We also have the big Memorial Day special running right now.
[00:35:55.335 --> 00:35:58.076]  Up to 60% off at double patriot points at InfoWarStore.
[00:35:59.384 --> 00:36:00.906]  And they showed me an x-ray.
[00:36:01.306 --> 00:36:05.130]  It said a .22 caliber bullet will lodge in the lung.
[00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:08.393]  And we can probably get it out.
[00:36:08.473 --> 00:36:12.277]  We may be able to save a life.
[00:36:12.497 --> 00:36:15.400]  A 9mm bullet blows the lung out of the body.
[00:36:16.678 --> 00:36:26.245]  So a nine millimeter round, he says, is a high powered round.
[00:36:26.485 --> 00:36:32.485]   about self-protection, hunting, I mean, I just, I remember it.
[00:36:32.485 --> 00:36:36.485]  The Constitution, the Second Amendment, was never absolute.
[00:36:36.485 --> 00:36:44.485]  So, a 9mm round, he says, is a high-powered round.
[00:36:44.485 --> 00:36:52.625]   Now, of course, this is a false dichotomy, a false debate, that a bullet shouldn't be designed for self-defense to
[00:36:52.625 --> 00:36:54.485]  stop somebody or kill somebody.
[00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.922]  If that's the case, the Secret Service, I guess, should use BB guns?
[00:37:00.003 --> 00:37:01.344]  Or how about Nerf guns?
[00:37:01.364 --> 00:37:04.987]  Because you don't need something that actually has force to protect yourself, right?
[00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:10.471]  But then the lie goes further.
[00:37:11.252 --> 00:37:22.245]   Anybody that knows anything about guns knows that the 9mm Is a very weak round compared to almost all other rounds.
[00:37:23.005 --> 00:37:29.709]  But the Germans popularized it in their Lugers, in World War II, and it got picked up because it has a low recoil.
[00:37:30.169 --> 00:37:33.191]  The magazines can fill a lot of rounds.
[00:37:34.932 --> 00:37:38.214]  The police like them in MP5s, H&Ks.
[00:37:39.935 --> 00:38:00.950]   But you can see on screen there, a .22 caliber of your TV viewer, Next to it, a 9mm, then a 10mm, then a .357 Magnum, a 5.7,
[00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:08.870]   a 5.56, the .223 they demonize so much, a 6.5 Creedmoor,
[00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:21.510]   a .308, and a .50 Cal BMG. How many people are murdered each year with .50 Cal BMGs?
[00:38:21.665 --> 00:38:25.188]  In the last several decades, it's three people?
[00:38:28.972 --> 00:38:30.394]  It's ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:33.056 --> 00:38:34.678]  Absolutely ridiculous.
[00:38:35.619 --> 00:38:39.723]  Now, what really matters is not even so much the size of the round, but the velocity.
[00:38:43.413 --> 00:38:49.597]  And I'm not going to get into all the ballistics, because I wouldn't call myself an expert, but I know which gun to use and which rifle to use when I'm doing what.
[00:38:49.617 --> 00:38:58.984]  But if you take that Creedmoor around, it's a very flat-shooting, long-range bullet, but it's very small.
[00:39:00.385 --> 00:39:03.647]  .308's what NATO used, very accurate, but has a drop to it.
[00:39:05.648 --> 00:39:14.679]   The .556 or .223, Deployed in Vietnam is lightweight, low recoil, and it's high velocity, so it causes a lot of damage.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:24.063]  And I can tell you the difference between a 10mm and a 9mm is massive.
[00:39:24.524 --> 00:39:37.793]   Because I've got 10 millimeter rifles, the same brand, and the power when you're shooting anything is just
[00:39:37.793 --> 00:39:39.004]  dramatically increased.
[00:39:39.185 --> 00:39:45.911]  But 10mm is not a popular round and most people don't have 10mm handguns or 10mm rifles.
[00:39:47.472 --> 00:40:00.564]   People buy what the media popularized and once a mass shooter uses a 5.56 or .223, everybody then wants the Bushmaster or they want the AR-15 variant, the M4.
[00:40:00.984 --> 00:40:10.207]  And so, the crazies, when they hear about all this going on, they go out and buy the gun they hear mass shooters use, because they're all very impressionable, because what are they doing in criminology?
[00:40:10.887 --> 00:40:11.907]  Copycatting.
[00:40:15.088 --> 00:40:15.908]  Copycatting.
[00:40:17.669 --> 00:40:22.811]  And until Columbine, where they used 5.56, you didn't have any mass shootings with them.
[00:40:24.631 --> 00:40:37.331]   But if you're saying, ban what's being used in mass shootings, Statistically still, the biggest year of mass shootings was 118 in this nation.
[00:40:39.533 --> 00:40:41.674]  Compared to everything else, it is a mirage.
[00:40:42.674 --> 00:40:47.917]  But the whole world is a stage, each of us players upon it, and that's what they're doing.
[00:40:47.957 --> 00:40:56.981]  So when he says that a 9mm blows your lung out of your body, that is the most ridiculous load of crap I have ever heard.
[00:41:01.212 --> 00:41:05.493]  Nine millimeters, if you shoot somebody in the chest, rarely go through.
[00:41:05.313 --> 00:41:18.552]   A .308 or a heavier round that almost no one uses in crimes because it hasn't been advertised
[00:41:18.552 --> 00:41:35.032]   as a thing to use will blow a hole right through a 400 pound wild hog.
[00:41:35.032 --> 00:41:36.032]  That's the reality.
[00:41:36.032 --> 00:41:36.032]  [End of Audio]
[00:41:36.032 --> 00:41:46.032]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:41:37.536 --> 00:41:44.358]  And I hate to even get up here on air and popularize what actually works for the crazies, because the crazies just go with hype.
[00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:57.003]  It doesn't matter what bullet it is or what rifle or gun it is, it's the worm-eaten satanic brains of people out there.
[00:41:57.883 --> 00:42:00.044]  And this stuff didn't exist 30 years ago.
[00:42:01.929 --> 00:42:12.073]  Or was extremely rare like the UT shooting and now compare it is an epidemic if you compare it didn't exist 50, 60 years ago and now it does happen a few times a year and it's wrong.
[00:42:14.654 --> 00:42:46.156]   But it's a smoke screen while the elite themselves are robbing us blind with insider trading, collapsing our borders, allowing mass murder on the border, huge human trafficking, pumping massive amounts of money into Ukraine, For hundreds of thousands to die while they turn around and tell you, a gun owner, a single mom, or a business owner, a convenience store operator, that you're bad when somebody else does something bad.
[00:42:46.656 --> 00:42:48.497]  That is just outrageous on its face.
[00:42:48.537 --> 00:42:53.418]  And I know as an audience you're smart and you get that, but we need to get out there and get the word out to the sheeple.
[00:42:53.438 --> 00:42:55.138]  Because let me tell you why we're winning the Second Amendment fight.
[00:42:56.719 --> 00:42:58.159]  Why they want to hurry up and finish it up.
[00:43:00.726 --> 00:43:01.587]  Get it defeated.
[00:43:03.108 --> 00:43:10.693]  If you go to any big gun shop or small gun shop around the country, they'll tell you more of their customers are leftist now than they used to be conservatives buying.
[00:43:12.148 --> 00:43:15.071]  The left is getting guns because they thought they'd have a civil war with Trump.
[00:43:15.591 --> 00:43:16.792]  They also know crime's exploding.
[00:43:16.812 --> 00:43:18.534]  They don't trust the system anymore to protect them.
[00:43:19.414 --> 00:43:23.458]  And they're out buying guns, and they're shooting guns, and they're thinking, why didn't I do this before?
[00:43:23.758 --> 00:43:30.624]  And they're meeting normal people at the gun ranges, and they're becoming more libertarian, and they're waking up.
[00:43:31.024 --> 00:43:32.726]  And this is a huge conversion happening.
[00:43:33.326 --> 00:43:40.753]  Every liberal I've known since childhood is now a Trump, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson listener.
[00:43:41.093 --> 00:43:42.214]  Black, white, old, young.
[00:43:44.416 --> 00:43:53.605]  And so the system is flipping out and they're admitting in national headlines that leftists are the fastest growing group of gun owners and something even better.
[00:43:55.410 --> 00:44:15.186]  Law-abiding good black folks and Hispanic folks that culturally and historically haven't gone out and bought guns and northerners and people that didn't have a gun culture are going out and getting guns and the areas where they have higher gun ownership, crime drops like a lead balloon.
[00:44:18.857 --> 00:44:23.980]  So yeah, they demonize conservatives in a big national study saying people are buying guns because they don't trust people.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.220]  You mean criminals?
[00:44:25.801 --> 00:44:28.361]  You mean the government to protect you?
[00:44:28.361 --> 00:44:33.881]  It's amazing.
[00:44:33.881 --> 00:44:43.881]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:44:35.866 --> 00:44:42.049]  You know, I told people a decade plus ago that Keanu Reeves was a awake person.
[00:44:43.049 --> 00:44:47.692]  I know because I've had dinner with him and hung out with him and in a film with him and consulted on it.
[00:44:48.959 --> 00:44:49.840]  He's a listener to the show.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:52.102]  Now you can see how he's hardcore publicly.
[00:44:52.842 --> 00:44:55.725]  I told you two years ago, Joe Rogan said, you know, I apologize.
[00:44:55.745 --> 00:44:56.606]  You were right about all this.
[00:44:56.666 --> 00:44:59.928]  I've woken up and I just didn't believe the system was this evil.
[00:44:59.948 --> 00:45:00.329]  You're right.
[00:45:01.169 --> 00:45:05.033]  And I told you, watch the transformation because he's very smooth how he does things.
[00:45:05.473 --> 00:45:07.875]  Now he's out defending the second amendment to the hill.
[00:45:09.116 --> 00:45:12.819]  And I only put this out to you to not say, look how important I am.
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.542]  I want you to realize how important you are.
[00:45:16.789 --> 00:45:20.350]  Because the best hope we've got of beating these people is this broadcast.
[00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:23.351]  This broadcast changed the world, and that means you changed the world.
[00:45:23.891 --> 00:45:26.012]  And I salute you and thank you before we start the second hour.
[00:45:26.472 --> 00:45:27.732]  We've got so much next hour.
[00:45:27.912 --> 00:45:28.572]  It just happened.
[00:45:29.312 --> 00:45:38.455]  The rigged jury, full of Hillary Clinton and Democratic Party operatives, acquitted Sussman on charge brought by Special Counsel Durham.
[00:45:39.695 --> 00:45:45.177]  We've got massive Big Pharma news on the COVID front, the new monkeypox lockdowns.
[00:45:46.385 --> 00:45:48.147]  And so much more coming up.
[00:45:48.828 --> 00:45:59.721]  We have a special guest for the third hour, but I intend to open the phones up specifically on the topic of Justin Trudeau and Biden tipping his hand that they are going to go after.
[00:45:59.741 --> 00:46:00.441]  Oh, that's the key.
[00:46:00.461 --> 00:46:01.483]  I should have said the start of the segment.
[00:46:02.466 --> 00:46:03.807]  They're going to go after the ammunition.
[00:46:03.967 --> 00:46:05.528]  They're going to try to ban calibers now.
[00:46:05.928 --> 00:46:06.709]  And that's been announced.
[00:46:06.749 --> 00:46:07.730]  They've done that in other countries.
[00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:10.331]  The Democrats have proposed it in California, other areas.
[00:46:10.371 --> 00:46:22.680]  So that's the moral of all that BS you just heard from Biden, is they are coming for your calibers and pretending like if a gun can kill somebody, it's illegal, when that's the whole damn point of them.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:26.202]  As a deterrent or to defend yourself in a last ditch operation.
[00:46:26.603 --> 00:46:29.004]  We'll be back with our number two, Infowars.com.
[00:46:29.004 --> 00:46:36.004]  Tomorrow's News.
[00:46:36.004 --> 00:46:40.164]  InfoWars has made history.
[00:46:40.835 --> 00:46:42.997]  You have made history in your support of InfoWars.
[00:46:43.518 --> 00:46:58.232]  And one of the biggest tools we've had to circumvent and override the censors has been Patriot apparel, so we can identify each other, so we can spread the word, and so we can push people to websites like InfoWars.com so they can understand the globalist plan and how to stop it.
[00:46:58.672 --> 00:47:04.915]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, two months ago we announced we're blowing out of all of our designs of t-shirts, some of which go back more than 25 years.
[00:47:05.415 --> 00:47:06.616]  All these shirts are limited edition.
[00:47:06.656 --> 00:47:11.398]  They are about to be history and will only exist in your closet, your drawer, or your wardrobe.
[00:47:11.839 --> 00:47:15.140]  So, there's only 15,000 shirts of 60-plus thousand left.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.802]  In a couple weeks, they'll all be gone and they'll be history.
[00:47:18.042 --> 00:47:22.464]  We're selling them all at cost at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:22.844 --> 00:47:24.245]  So, thank you all for your support.
[00:47:24.565 --> 00:47:33.788]   Please visit InfoWarsTore.com and get One of these historic shirts, hoodies, long sleeves, ball caps, you name it, while you still can, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:47:34.009 --> 00:47:46.168]   InfowarStore.com And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Infowar and
[00:47:46.168 --> 00:47:49.809]   say, "I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you ought to fight!"
[00:47:49.794 --> 00:47:51.655]  You better believe you got one!
[00:47:54.178 --> 00:47:59.178]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:59.178 --> 00:48:13.178]  [Music]
[00:48:13.178 --> 00:48:23.178]  [Music]
[00:48:23.178 --> 00:48:28.178]   In Davos, Switzerland, Klaus Schwab and his fellow wannabe tyrants
[00:48:28.178 --> 00:48:32.178]   have come out into the open as the arbiters of world government.
[00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:37.332]  They are openly calling for world war and the end of national sovereignty.
[00:48:37.872 --> 00:48:41.853]  And they openly acknowledge that they must move quickly to be victorious.
[00:48:43.294 --> 00:48:52.441]  Many are celebrating the fact that the people of Sri Lanka are rising up against their corrupt politicians, burning their homes and destroying city property.
[00:48:53.222 --> 00:48:54.663]  But this is nothing to celebrate.
[00:48:55.143 --> 00:48:58.466]  This is exactly what the World Economic Forum is hoping for.
[00:48:59.146 --> 00:49:04.310]  They want governments to be destroyed and the people to lose all faith in the nation-state.
[00:49:05.191 --> 00:49:11.176]  Their plan is to starve the people into destroying their own governments so they can act as saviors.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:18.601]  It is important for Americans to realize that the current administration is not failing at all.
[00:49:19.602 --> 00:49:22.362]  They are accomplishing exactly what they set out to do.
[00:49:23.202 --> 00:49:26.603]  They did not steal the 2020 election to secure power.
[00:49:27.163 --> 00:49:31.324]  They did it to destroy America and destabilize the entire system.
[00:49:31.925 --> 00:49:33.525]  And they are rapidly succeeding.
[00:49:34.895 --> 00:49:38.879]  The voices calling for violence are as ignorant and mad as they sound.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.781]  Violence towards who?
[00:49:41.282 --> 00:49:42.283]  How will you organize?
[00:49:42.663 --> 00:49:43.744]  And who are you going to fight?
[00:49:44.245 --> 00:49:45.967]  Your brainwashed sheep neighbors?
[00:49:46.848 --> 00:49:49.570]  That is exactly what the globalists want you to do.
[00:49:50.231 --> 00:49:57.399]  And if your plan is to wait until they come to your door, then you'll just be a dangerous animal in a cave on someone else's private property.
[00:49:59.164 --> 00:50:00.386]  But there are solutions.
[00:50:01.067 --> 00:50:12.865]  For example, before passing in March of 2022, the great Jordan Maxwell's last project was to save America from global governance with America 21.
[00:50:14.928 --> 00:50:30.139]  America 21's mission is to gut the system of globalist interference and reclaim all of America by 2025, so that we can rebuild our agriculture, production, and energy, and become a self-sufficient nation that serves the people.
[00:50:30.679 --> 00:50:39.025]  America 21 is calling for a complete withdrawal from all treaties and influences of the United Nations and World Economic Forum.
[00:50:39.505 --> 00:50:43.608]  Washington DC is just a symbol of our old corrupt federal government.
[00:50:44.108 --> 00:50:51.150]  The New World leaders are living abroad, and the only way they can control us is through the compliance of our local governments.
[00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:57.991]  According to America 21, your focus needs to be where you live, in your county and city.
[00:50:58.572 --> 00:51:02.813]  Global governance ultimately depends on your county being taken over.
[00:51:03.133 --> 00:51:05.193]  This is where you need to resist now.
[00:51:05.813 --> 00:51:11.575]  This is how the United Nations and the globalists have been doing it, and it's the only way to properly reverse it.
[00:51:12.836 --> 00:51:31.045]  America 21 has been having success in Montana, and they freely share their working model and support at America21Century.com, such as learning what language to look for in your local governments to detect UN initiatives and protocols being deployed by your local officials.
[00:51:31.545 --> 00:51:36.808]  Keywords such as 2030, sustainable development, and carbon neutral.
[00:51:38.231 --> 00:51:43.533]  Your local officials have to live with you, and in most cases will prefer to keep their jobs.
[00:51:44.113 --> 00:51:49.174]  Our voting system may be broken, but our elected officials still work for us.
[00:51:49.614 --> 00:51:57.017]  And if enough of us come together, we can put the pressure on them to renounce global governance and to serve the will of the people.
[00:51:57.517 --> 00:51:59.417]  This is the law of the land.
[00:52:00.037 --> 00:52:01.738]  It really is just that simple.
[00:52:02.178 --> 00:52:04.459]  But we have to come together and get active.
[00:52:05.689 --> 00:52:07.170]  Americans have a choice.
[00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:16.914]  We can either take action to purge the system of corrupt politicians and their thugs, or we can stop complaining about them and be good slaves.
[00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:21.136]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:52:22.917 --> 00:52:24.378]  All right, my friends, we're going to go to break.
[00:52:25.819 --> 00:52:31.061]  We spent the whole first hour on the gun confiscation starting in Canada under the World Economic Forum's control.
[00:52:31.081 --> 00:52:33.682]  We're going to get all the other big news when we come back in 60 seconds.
[00:52:33.702 --> 00:52:34.443]  Stay with us.
[00:52:36.824 --> 00:52:48.227]  So, Barack Obama's third administration puppet, Biden, has come out and said, yeah, they're looking at banning high-powered ammo, like 9mm.
[00:52:48.267 --> 00:52:50.028]  This isn't even high-powered, it's weak.
[00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:54.209]  Kamala Harris says time to ban all semi-autos.
[00:52:55.289 --> 00:53:00.151]  Canada announces a freeze on selling or transferring any handguns ahead of confiscation.
[00:53:01.011 --> 00:53:02.131]  Unbelievable information.
[00:53:02.171 --> 00:53:04.852]  But now, I want to hit a bunch of other news.
[00:53:06.167 --> 00:53:07.828]  And then come back at the bottom of the hour.
[00:53:07.848 --> 00:53:09.209]  I'm going to give the number out.
[00:53:09.629 --> 00:53:13.172]  We'll take six, seven calls in the last two segments of the hour.
[00:53:14.958 --> 00:53:26.920]  On your view on Trudeau and the WEF puppet carrying out their agenda of banning free speech, coming after the guns, and Klaus Schwab bragging in an earlier clip that he is directly under his command.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.301]  I mean, this is just insane.
[00:53:28.941 --> 00:53:31.461]  If you realize, the Democratic Party uses all the same nomenclature.
[00:53:32.221 --> 00:53:34.422]  They follow the same directives, the same scripts.
[00:53:34.902 --> 00:53:38.303]  This is global government staring us in the face, and Klaus Schwab bragged last Monday.
[00:53:38.323 --> 00:53:40.063]  He played the clip probably 10 times.
[00:53:41.536 --> 00:53:45.683]  That the WEF is in control of the major governments and that they rule the world.
[00:53:46.124 --> 00:53:54.017]  And they went on to say, we're going to censor you, we're going to take over your bodies, we're going to disarm you, we're going to make you obsolete, we're going to make you live in your house in the metaverse.
[00:53:54.137 --> 00:53:54.878]  It's all been announced.
[00:53:56.479 --> 00:53:59.840]  Moving so incredibly quickly right now.
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.261]  And where are our leaders even talking about it?
[00:54:02.301 --> 00:54:03.361]  Well, they're starting to some.
[00:54:03.901 --> 00:54:04.722]  Senator Paul and others.
[00:54:04.762 --> 00:54:20.807]  But this should be the number one issue of an outside multinational corporate combine exerting its power over the world and preparing new lockdowns that they war-gamed a year ago for May and June to roll out the monkey pox with the lockdowns implemented in August.
[00:54:21.147 --> 00:54:22.007]  Now that's their plan.
[00:54:22.067 --> 00:54:23.528]  It's all scripted like you're idiots.
[00:54:25.094 --> 00:54:28.276]  They got to script it and prepare it, and they just think you won't notice.
[00:54:29.576 --> 00:54:30.937]  They ordered the vaccine before.
[00:54:31.957 --> 00:54:32.958]  They war-gamed it all.
[00:54:34.159 --> 00:54:34.799]  Unbelievable.
[00:54:34.839 --> 00:54:37.100]  We've got some big news, huge news on that front.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.181]  But first, let me give you the number.
[00:54:40.021 --> 00:54:41.202]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:54:41.222 --> 00:54:41.382]  877-789-Alex.
[00:54:41.402 --> 00:54:41.442]  877-789-2539.
[00:54:41.262 --> 00:54:52.262]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[00:54:52.262 --> 00:54:56.861]  First-time callers on one topic, the gun grab.
[00:54:57.405 --> 00:54:57.885]  Canada.
[00:54:57.965 --> 00:54:58.685]  The W.E.F.
[00:54:58.745 --> 00:54:59.426]  in control of it.
[00:55:00.326 --> 00:55:01.647]  What do you think's coming next?
[00:55:01.727 --> 00:55:12.033]  And you understand that I'm telling you that they do intend to try major gun confiscation in this country to try to trigger a civil war because they want to collapse the United States.
[00:55:13.053 --> 00:55:21.538]  That's why we need to be nonviolent and not let them push us into a confrontation because they've already stolen the last election.
[00:55:21.578 --> 00:55:25.020]  They plan on stealing the midterms and they plan on triggering violence.
[00:55:26.351 --> 00:55:41.379]  If we can keep from being violent back, at least in the first phase, it'll cause an even bigger realignment, and you'll see more leaders in Congress, more governors and others, fully energize and stand up, and our victory will be assured.
[00:55:41.999 --> 00:55:44.720]  They'll have their own people turn against them, whistleblowers, you name it.
[00:55:45.141 --> 00:55:50.383]  There are a lot of people in the establishment that know the globalists have this plan, and think it's just too dangerous to try to execute.
[00:55:50.423 --> 00:55:55.086]  They're for it, but they think they're failing, and that gambling like this is dangerous.
[00:55:56.690 --> 00:56:00.091]  And so the New World Order is very, very weak in their own internal documents.
[00:56:00.551 --> 00:56:01.232]  They admit that.
[00:56:01.292 --> 00:56:04.453]  So your calls are coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:56:04.513 --> 00:56:05.573]  Love to hear from Canadians.
[00:56:06.133 --> 00:56:08.674]  Particularly, you'll go to the head of the line at 877-789-2539.
[00:56:08.894 --> 00:56:13.616]  I see the first call come in as Craig from Canada.
[00:56:14.076 --> 00:56:16.117]  I thought, oh yeah, obviously, Canadians.
[00:56:16.897 --> 00:56:20.138]  We'll put you to the head of the line, 877-789-2539.
[00:56:20.158 --> 00:56:21.679]  What is your view of the situation?
[00:56:22.839 --> 00:56:24.400]  Okay, let's move quickly through a bunch of other news.
[00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:27.049]  Talk about lawlessness in the government.
[00:56:27.069 --> 00:56:27.990]  Talk about above the law.
[00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:30.030]  Sussman lied to the FBI.
[00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:43.713]  Sussman took fake documents created by Hillary Clinton, gave them to them to try to then get Trump spied on, which they did, and to get billions of dollars of CIA funding to use domestically against the American people.
[00:56:44.713 --> 00:56:53.295]  Sussman acquitted on charge brought by Special Counsel Durham, the jury that had a bunch of people that actually worked for Obama and Hillary, not just voters, but actually worked for him.
[00:56:54.892 --> 00:57:11.473]   The jury acquitted Michael Sussman, 57, on charges that he lied when he allegedly denied he was acting on behalf of any client and alerting the FBI to claims that a secret server Link Trump to a Moscow bank.
[00:57:11.533 --> 00:57:12.294]  It was all fake.
[00:57:12.934 --> 00:57:13.894]  They knew it was fake.
[00:57:14.354 --> 00:57:15.575]  He said it wasn't paid for.
[00:57:15.655 --> 00:57:17.155]  He said it was the Democratic Party.
[00:57:17.915 --> 00:57:20.336]  He filed a fake report and fake dossier.
[00:57:21.216 --> 00:57:23.137]  And of course the higher-ups, the FBI, knew this.
[00:57:23.937 --> 00:57:25.417]  They've come out and defended Sussman.
[00:57:25.457 --> 00:57:26.498]  This is disgusting.
[00:57:28.238 --> 00:57:31.999]  Ex-Clinton campaign lawyer Sussman not guilty in Trump-Russia trial.
[00:57:33.039 --> 00:57:38.041]  A green light for them to engage in even more criminal activity.
[00:57:39.582 --> 00:57:44.835]  Absolutely insane that that is going on.
[00:57:45.837 --> 00:57:46.880]  Now let's look at this stat.
[00:57:48.732 --> 00:58:02.036]  Big Pharma boss caught faking his COVID vaccination status, injected himself with salt water instead, now facing criminal charges along with hundreds of other celebrities who, by the way, pushed the shots.
[00:58:02.616 --> 00:58:07.818]  This is in Spain, which is a total police state, never came out of martial law under Franco.
[00:58:08.258 --> 00:58:09.078]  Very, very sad.
[00:58:09.918 --> 00:58:15.240]  Big Pharma boss caught faking his COVID vaccination status, injecting himself with salt water instead.
[00:58:16.837 --> 00:58:22.358]  Well, the WHO and our political leaders want us to trust the COVID vaccines and push for legal measures to force it upon us.
[00:58:22.779 --> 00:58:26.419]  It seems even big pharma executives don't even trust the safety of the vax.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:31.801]  I talked to a billionaire, well-known owner of a biotech company, in person.
[00:58:32.681 --> 00:58:33.241]  Ran into him.
[00:58:33.261 --> 00:58:35.322]  Didn't know who they were at the time when I looked him up.
[00:58:35.802 --> 00:58:36.462]  Big scientist.
[00:58:37.802 --> 00:58:39.883]  Two years ago, he said, don't take that vaccine.
[00:58:41.123 --> 00:58:42.244]  It'll destroy your immune system.
[00:58:43.344 --> 00:58:43.624]  And more.
[00:58:46.818 --> 00:58:49.940]  Spanish actress investigated for buying fraudulent COVID pass.
[00:58:51.241 --> 00:58:52.222]  That's your global pass.
[00:58:52.922 --> 00:58:58.567]  The president of PharmaMar, among more than 2,200 falsely vaccinated with COVID.
[00:58:58.587 --> 00:59:00.668]  We're talking about arresting hundreds.
[00:59:02.189 --> 00:59:08.994]  Many questions remain over the false COVID-19 vaccine certificates bought by stars, sports personalities, and business leaders.
[00:59:10.335 --> 00:59:20.117]   Meanwhile, Fauci It's revealed, had a war game of the mousepox being released shortly before that began spreading in the global outbreak.
[00:59:20.918 --> 00:59:23.901]  And his answer, of course, forced inoculation.
[00:59:23.941 --> 00:59:28.044]  He got a $10 million grant to run the Fairmongering program.
[00:59:29.845 --> 00:59:41.622]   So Tom Cruise was right to giving kids Ritalin and Adderall and All these other dangerous drugs is out of control, but what about the gene therapy shots?
[00:59:41.642 --> 00:59:45.265]  They're giving five and ups and causing heart attacks and so many problems.
[00:59:46.346 --> 00:59:49.368]  Bill Gates says the next pandemic likely to be caused by climate change.
[00:59:49.588 --> 00:59:50.849]  It's gonna come out of the jungle.
[00:59:50.949 --> 00:59:53.551]  It's your fault, not out of the labs he controls.
[00:59:53.591 --> 00:59:54.472]  Told you that was coming.
[00:59:54.711 --> 00:59:56.711]  tomorrow's news today.
[00:59:56.711 --> 01:00:06.992]   And some good news, in the UK they've got big petitions saying do not sign the WHO pandemic treaty unless it is
[01:00:06.992 --> 01:00:09.711]  approved via public referendum.
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.920]  Count Dankula is laying it out.
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:20.139]   Now please explain to me how again democracy is power to the people.
[01:00:20.139 --> 01:00:21.139]  Now look at this one.
[01:00:21.164 --> 01:00:25.026]  Report, more than 3,000 diabetics in the UK died because of COVID lockdowns.
[01:00:26.164 --> 01:00:30.828]  They were denying people basic medical care during all of that as well.
[01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:33.711]  All part of the death panels in their own words.
[01:00:37.608 --> 01:00:46.715]  Who's out of the Gateway Pundit, one of the largest egg factories in the U.S., torched in the middle of the night amid outbreak of fires in food processing facilities across the nation.
[01:00:46.796 --> 01:00:48.637]  On average, one is burning a day.
[01:00:49.177 --> 01:00:50.739]  And you wonder why there's food shortages.
[01:00:51.619 --> 01:00:54.001]  And Royce White asked the question, we're at war.
[01:00:54.502 --> 01:00:56.844]  The question is whether the enemy is foreign or domestic.
[01:00:56.864 --> 01:00:58.165]  Well, who's shutting off the pipelines?
[01:00:58.725 --> 01:00:59.826]  Who's dissolving the borders?
[01:01:00.307 --> 01:01:02.128]  Who's doing all of this?
[01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:05.451]  I ask you that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:06.601 --> 01:01:08.142]  Now the big news when we come back.
[01:01:09.363 --> 01:01:11.625]  Russia threatens to wipe out the entire U.S.
[01:01:11.745 --> 01:01:15.748]  with just four Satan 2 missiles and chilling warning over Ukraine.
[01:01:17.329 --> 01:01:19.510]  And that ties into some other big news on that front.
[01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:25.274]  Mainstream media praises Ukraine's Azov battalion for dropping Nazi patches from the uniform.
[01:01:25.755 --> 01:01:27.676]  That's the Times of London.
[01:01:28.096 --> 01:01:29.857]  Talk about surreal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:30.378 --> 01:01:32.519]  You cannot make this up.
[01:01:32.659 --> 01:01:45.316]   More details of that When we come back and also reports on who controls the World Health Organization, it's now admitted that Communist China controls the panel.
[01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:51.416]   They've now just elected another member of the World Health Organization Executive Board with no objections.
[01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:59.416]  We'll be right back, my friends.
[01:01:59.526 --> 01:02:00.607]  This is the Great Reset.
[01:02:00.687 --> 01:02:01.507]  What are you going to do about it?
[01:02:02.788 --> 01:02:03.549]  I'll tell you about it.
[01:02:04.594 --> 01:02:12.678]  It is possible to admit that the special operation of Russia on Ukraine is over, in the sense that the real war has begun, and the third world war.
[01:02:12.818 --> 01:02:20.062]  We are forced to demilitarize not just Ukraine, but the entire North Atlantic Alliance.
[01:02:20.082 --> 01:02:20.982]  Why am I talking about this?
[01:02:20.842 --> 01:02:28.842]   The war is a third world war, and we have to demilitarize not only Ukraine, but the whole North Atlantic Alliance.
[01:02:28.842 --> 01:02:30.842]  Why am I talking about this?
[01:02:30.842 --> 01:02:35.842]   The strikes on Donetsk were not only launched by the missiles of the Russian Air Force "Smerch" from the Kasyan.
[01:02:35.871 --> 01:02:37.612]  Russia threatens to wipe out the entire U.S.
[01:02:37.432 --> 01:02:44.432]   The remarks were made from the very American howitzers, the American howitzers M3.
[01:02:45.432 --> 01:02:53.432]   National Russian television is putting out state propaganda threatening to nuke the United States.
[01:02:53.432 --> 01:03:01.432]   Russia threatens to wipe out the entire US with just four Satan 2 missiles and chilling warning over Ukraine.
[01:03:01.432 --> 01:03:11.432]   A chilling moment on Russian state TV on Monday saw a host issue the latest in a long line of threats,
[01:03:11.432 --> 01:03:17.432]   this time warning Putin could "destroy the entire east coast of the US with just four Satan 2 missiles."
[01:03:17.253 --> 01:03:18.194]  with just two missiles.
[01:03:18.934 --> 01:03:29.364]  In footage from Russia's flagship propaganda show, a member of Russia's parliament boasts about the nation's military might for also labeling two million Ukrainians as incurable.
[01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:34.261]  Russian propaganda declares World War III has already started.
[01:03:34.322 --> 01:03:38.482]  A terrifying Kremlin TV threat reads another headline.
[01:03:39.783 --> 01:03:41.783]  Meanwhile, here's the Times of London.
[01:03:43.363 --> 01:03:48.764]  Azov battalion drops neo-Nazi symbol exploited by Russian propagandist.
[01:03:49.684 --> 01:03:50.745]  Talk about propagandist.
[01:03:50.805 --> 01:03:52.025]  It is a Nazi battalion.
[01:03:52.045 --> 01:03:53.545]  They are Nazis at Heil Hitler.
[01:03:54.425 --> 01:03:55.586]  And now they're the good guys.
[01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:57.826]  Isn't that just cute?
[01:04:01.007 --> 01:04:07.554]  Mainstream media praises Ukraine's Azov battalion for dropping Nazi patches from their uniforms.
[01:04:08.695 --> 01:04:10.878]  So that's where we are in the globalist proxy war.
[01:04:12.159 --> 01:04:25.560]   And the neocons, crazy leftist, wanted Biden to transfer long-range missiles Heavy missiles to Ukraine.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.121]  Ukraine's already been attacking inside Russia.
[01:04:29.082 --> 01:04:33.965]  And Biden did something smart, or whoever's handling him did, and said no.
[01:04:34.626 --> 01:04:43.992]  And now his own party's calling him a traitor because he doesn't want to send offensive weapons to the Ukrainians.
[01:04:44.052 --> 01:04:53.820]   I guess the 60 billion in the last couple months isn't enough, and the new 5 billion They're demanding every single month.
[01:04:55.621 --> 01:04:57.261]  So pray for peace, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:04:58.641 --> 01:05:01.442]  That's where we are in the year 2022.
[01:05:03.203 --> 01:05:17.767]  And I have to just ask all of you listening, who do you think is destroying our country?
[01:05:21.257 --> 01:05:24.579]  Who do you think is dismantling our nation?
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.662]  Who do you think is carrying out the economic warfare?
[01:05:32.683 --> 01:05:37.785]  Who do you think is pushing the transgenderism to break up the family?
[01:05:40.287 --> 01:05:43.548]  Is it the Russians?
[01:05:44.709 --> 01:05:47.130]  Or is it the World Economic Forum and the megacorporations?
[01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:49.852]  Who's allied with the Communist Chinese?
[01:05:50.922 --> 01:05:51.762]  World Economic Forum.
[01:05:53.243 --> 01:05:54.944]  We see these headlines in the UK.
[01:05:54.984 --> 01:05:56.065]  We see these headlines here in the US.
[01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:57.346]  This is out of the BBC.
[01:05:58.946 --> 01:06:01.008]  Is this the end of retirement as we know it?
[01:06:01.408 --> 01:06:01.988]  That's right.
[01:06:02.068 --> 01:06:07.811]  In the world of robots, in the world of the future, you work more and you have less because of inflation.
[01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:11.853]  Eurozone inflation reaches 8.1 in May.
[01:06:12.854 --> 01:06:14.735]  Russian oil exports in India jumped 25 times.
[01:06:16.894 --> 01:06:20.657]  Russia starts cutting off gas in the Netherlands and its government refuses to pay in rubles.
[01:06:22.078 --> 01:06:24.860]  Households worldwide wrecked by soaring gas prices.
[01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:30.224]  French economy shrank unexpectedly in the first quarter amid surging inflation.
[01:06:30.964 --> 01:06:37.689]  Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, says West prevents Russian ships from docking at ports to exacerbate the food crisis.
[01:06:38.450 --> 01:06:40.251]  Yeah, who shut down the baby formula factories?
[01:06:42.653 --> 01:06:45.355]  The unpopular puppet.
[01:06:47.648 --> 01:06:51.690]  Of the New World Order, Joe Biden.
[01:06:54.032 --> 01:06:55.272]  And the list goes on and on.
[01:06:57.274 --> 01:07:03.557]  And looking at the attacks on our children, there's got to be light at the end of the tunnel.
[01:07:05.138 --> 01:07:12.422]  And there is, as governors and legislatures pass laws saying, don't talk to children about their sexual preference.
[01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:14.784]  Don't talk to them about how they can be another sex.
[01:07:16.212 --> 01:07:18.533]  Don't do it until at least the eighth grade.
[01:07:21.555 --> 01:07:26.877]  And the answer is they say that they're banning the word gay and that's not what's happening.
[01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:29.298]  Our children are being targeted politically and sexually.
[01:07:30.359 --> 01:07:40.944]  Biden admin K-12 schools, that's five-year-olds and up, must put boys in girls bathrooms to get federal lunch money.
[01:07:42.004 --> 01:07:44.706]  How perverted and sick and evil.
[01:07:44.806 --> 01:07:52.541]   Killing The classic division of the sexes and the human dynamic and the mammalian dynamic.
[01:07:53.301 --> 01:07:54.181]  But there's good news.
[01:07:54.262 --> 01:07:56.143]  Doctors say the sky is blue.
[01:07:57.563 --> 01:08:00.965]  Top doctors say trans swimmer has unfair advantage.
[01:08:01.685 --> 01:08:03.186]  A Paul Joseph Watson article.
[01:08:04.327 --> 01:08:13.792]  Top doctors told the New York Times that transgender swimmer Leah Thompson has had an unfair advantage over biological females despite the athlete having undergone testosterone suppressing therapy.
[01:08:14.372 --> 01:08:21.675]   A transgender swimmer who was born a man Stoke Controversy after winning the 500-yard NCAA Women's Championship in March.
[01:08:22.776 --> 01:08:29.281]  Florida Governor Rhonda Santus responded by asserting that the real winner was the biological female competitor who came in second place.
[01:08:29.961 --> 01:08:44.131]  After entering female competitions, Thomas has soured international rankings, soared international rankings, jumping from 20th, 32nd place in men's meets to 8th in women.
[01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:46.771]  And it's moving up the chart.
[01:08:46.871 --> 01:08:48.892]  I mean, this is just asinine.
[01:08:48.932 --> 01:08:53.854]  And the answer is, create a trans league, they're saying.
[01:08:56.255 --> 01:09:18.310]   And of course, as they come out with human-animal hybrids and human-splice hybrids that aren't really humanoids, as people get their designer babies, this is all just getting us ready for the whole transhumanist revolution that is here, that is using Gender dysphoria and confusion and mental illness as the pretext to take over society.
[01:09:19.931 --> 01:09:21.932]  And I don't hate any men that think they're women.
[01:09:22.893 --> 01:09:25.474]  I don't hate anybody for what they do as adults.
[01:09:25.794 --> 01:09:27.075]  As long as they don't hurt innocent people.
[01:09:27.515 --> 01:09:28.976]  And I'm not judging anybody.
[01:09:28.996 --> 01:09:32.498]  I was just on Blair White's first big podcast going viral now.
[01:09:33.059 --> 01:09:33.939]  Very nice person.
[01:09:33.979 --> 01:09:34.599]  Very smart.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.821]  Against the targeting of children.
[01:09:38.641 --> 01:09:41.664]  Is a genuine real person who's very nice and I think a good person.
[01:09:42.465 --> 01:09:47.189]  And I'm not judging Blair White any more than I can judge anybody else.
[01:09:49.011 --> 01:09:54.776]  And so they try to say, oh, anybody that doesn't want five-year-olds taught about this hates people.
[01:09:55.197 --> 01:10:14.377]   I don't want a five-year-old taught about heterosexual sex, homosexual sex, any of this and be labeled by the state and then Put into a category where the state begins to take parental rights from the parents and prepare them to be sterilized basically.
[01:10:15.797 --> 01:10:19.078]  That's why you see in California upwards of half the children say they're transgender.
[01:10:19.399 --> 01:10:21.780]  That is brainwashing.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.961]  That is by design and it must end.
[01:10:26.443 --> 01:10:32.348]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to come back with your phone calls on the global gun grab run by the WEF and how to stop it.
[01:10:32.668 --> 01:10:34.349]  Got a bunch of Canadian callers and others.
[01:10:34.369 --> 01:10:37.272]  It's Trudeau, the dictator, announces he's coming for the guns.

[01:10:55.365 --> 01:10:56.326]  It certainly paid off.

[01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:46.630]  We can't do that.
[01:12:47.651 --> 01:12:49.192]  These are collector's items.
[01:12:49.612 --> 01:12:52.154]  Many of them are selling for three, four times what they were previously.

[01:13:07.046 --> 01:13:11.972]  Except we have 72 of the first two coins.
[01:13:13.339 --> 01:13:16.441]  We actually have 76 and 72, but we've got to sell them a set.
[01:13:16.881 --> 01:13:24.747]  So next week, there'll be a limited offering of all three coins together, and then they're all completely gone, except for two or three I kept for myself.
[01:13:24.807 --> 01:13:29.130]  So they will 100% be sold out next week in the three-coin set.
[01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:32.812]  We're waiting until we get down to 72 coins here.
[01:13:32.832 --> 01:13:37.716]  And we're almost 70% sold out of the Molon Lambe Freeman Bear Arms coin at 1776coin.com.
[01:13:41.849 --> 01:13:45.311]  Or you can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:13:45.471 --> 01:13:45.791]  Okay.
[01:13:46.592 --> 01:13:53.696]  Thanks for keeping the First Amendment on the air, fighting for people's freedoms worldwide, and inspiring liberty on a planetary scale.
[01:13:54.436 --> 01:13:58.839]  Let's go to the callers, the order they received from Canada.
[01:13:59.259 --> 01:14:06.543]  Craig in Canada, under siege, with Trudeau's giant gun ban announcement, which will follow with confiscation.
[01:14:06.623 --> 01:14:07.424]  It's the same formula.
[01:14:07.704 --> 01:14:09.085]  Craig, what's your view on the situation?
[01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:11.681]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:14:11.821 --> 01:14:19.385]  So, uh, back in last November, I actually went to go get my PAL license to go take the safety courses and whatnot.
[01:14:19.945 --> 01:14:29.690]  And while I was there, the instructors advised all of us, they're like, you should get your R-PAL right now at the same time, because in a few months, Justin Trudeau is planning to take all this away.
[01:14:30.611 --> 01:14:32.312]  And now it's happening.
[01:14:32.412 --> 01:14:36.194]  So they were basically right, and it was coming to an end.
[01:14:37.712 --> 01:14:41.712]   Everyone needs to stand up and do what we gotta do, whatever that is.
[01:14:41.712 --> 01:14:44.212]  And they always do it in increments.
[01:14:44.212 --> 01:14:49.412]   Well, he banned free speech, he held people that led the peaceful protest without bail,
[01:14:49.412 --> 01:14:50.952]  he said he wants to be a dictator.
[01:14:50.952 --> 01:14:53.792]  Obviously the evidence showed he stole the last election.
[01:14:53.792 --> 01:14:56.992]   He's insanely unpopular, he's barely still controlled parliament.
[01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:59.353]  Again, he lost the election American style.
[01:14:59.689 --> 01:15:01.491]  He didn't get 50% of the vote, but he got like 30.
[01:15:01.912 --> 01:15:03.813]  His party is almost out of power.
[01:15:03.913 --> 01:15:06.596]  It was a referendum against him, but a lot of fraud came out.
[01:15:07.057 --> 01:15:13.463]  So you need to beat the drum to recall him and have him removed and have another emergency snap election.
[01:15:13.923 --> 01:15:14.844]  That is the answer.
[01:15:14.864 --> 01:15:15.585]  What do you think, Craig?
[01:15:16.621 --> 01:15:18.963]  Well, he can't even go around and campaign.
[01:15:19.484 --> 01:15:20.225]  He's too scared.
[01:15:20.265 --> 01:15:21.526]  He gets everywhere he goes.
[01:15:21.586 --> 01:15:28.493]  He goes to these like thousand dollar plate dinners and he has to walk away because there's too many people standing outside that don't want him there.
[01:15:29.133 --> 01:15:29.473]  That's right.
[01:15:29.493 --> 01:15:31.656]  He's chased around and yelled at and screamed at everywhere.
[01:15:31.696 --> 01:15:35.039]  What really freaks out the left is half the folks aren't white yelling at him.
[01:15:35.479 --> 01:15:37.882]  So they try to say, oh, white supremacists don't like Trudeau.
[01:15:37.942 --> 01:15:39.063]  No, everybody hates him.
[01:15:40.151 --> 01:15:46.073]  Exactly, all you gotta do is look at the footage that Rebel News and stuff puts out, and it's people from all over the place.
[01:15:46.113 --> 01:15:51.616]  Like, I'm up in Northern Alberta, and you can't find a Trudeau supporter anywhere you go.
[01:15:52.456 --> 01:15:53.296]  God bless you, Craig.
[01:15:54.777 --> 01:15:59.439]  That's what dictators do, because they're unpopular, they try to disarm their slaves while they have taxpayers pay for their protection.
[01:15:59.879 --> 01:16:01.660]  Jay in Canada, then David in Canada.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:02.540]  Jay, welcome.
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:04.721]  Hi, how are you doing, Alex?
[01:16:04.761 --> 01:16:05.081]  Good, sir.
[01:16:06.452 --> 01:16:13.456]  I just wanted to call in a war in America, what can happen when a liberal dictator is in power and how much of a hypocrite he is.
[01:16:13.677 --> 01:16:16.618]  So basically, you know, he's taking away the guns from Canadians.
[01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:21.902]  But yet again, he gets rid of mandatory minimum for gun offenses.
[01:16:22.682 --> 01:16:30.907]  So basically, you can go rob someone with a gun and get out in a year instead of, for instance, a mandatory minimum as in like five years.
[01:16:31.707 --> 01:16:35.890]  So what he does, everything he does is just a hypocrisy.
[01:16:36.405 --> 01:16:39.486]  Oh, it's always to increase crime, to terrorize the public, and accepting gun control.
[01:16:39.506 --> 01:16:40.626]  It's the same worldwide formula.
[01:16:40.926 --> 01:16:47.447]  Meanwhile, he goes to Ukraine and says, hand everybody AK-47s with your taxpayer money and M-16s, but you can't have a gun.
[01:16:47.527 --> 01:16:48.247]  It's ridiculous.
[01:16:48.987 --> 01:17:07.219]   Yeah, and, you know, what's even worse is we got even, you know, there's so much far less politics in our government, and we even had Jagmeet Singh, the leader of the NDP party, propose a plan to get rid of our Canadian Armed Forces, to utilize that money for more socialized Program.
[01:17:07.819 --> 01:17:13.764]  So this is what I mean when you have dictators running your country that, you know, they don't have the national interest for Canadians.
[01:17:14.104 --> 01:17:22.872]  Your own military came out earlier this year and said they leaked a document that Trudeau was putting Chinese spies all in charge of the Canadian military.
[01:17:23.432 --> 01:17:25.454]  They were flying in our Air Force.
[01:17:26.114 --> 01:17:28.316]  It is unbelievable what this guy does.
[01:17:28.376 --> 01:17:29.637]  I don't know his way of thinking.
[01:17:29.677 --> 01:17:30.878]  Canadians are strong.
[01:17:31.379 --> 01:17:32.700]  We are strong-willed people.
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.101]  We love Americans.
[01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:38.029]  And you know what he's doing to this country is very sad.
[01:17:38.029 --> 01:17:42.670]   And you know what, I hope Canadians wake up, but the problem is, I'm not just trying to
[01:17:42.670 --> 01:17:44.750]  face it, but it's mass migration too.
[01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:48.989]   Half the people that are, more than half the people that are coming into the country don't
[01:17:48.989 --> 01:17:49.989]  care about politics.
[01:17:49.989 --> 01:17:52.429]  They vote for the person that's helping them out.
[01:17:52.429 --> 01:17:54.750]  And this is what's leading us down this road.
[01:17:55.685 --> 01:17:56.026]  That's right.
[01:17:56.046 --> 01:18:05.252]  We don't hate the people being brought in as refugees from the New World Order, but they are being kept in control as a new permanent underclass to outvote the indigenous populations and take your liberties.
[01:18:05.432 --> 01:18:06.232]  Absolutely right.
[01:18:06.272 --> 01:18:07.093]  Great points, Jay.
[01:18:07.573 --> 01:18:08.754]  David in Canada.
[01:18:08.994 --> 01:18:09.815]  David, you're on the air.
[01:18:11.236 --> 01:18:11.756]  Hey, Jones.
[01:18:11.796 --> 01:18:12.857]  Such a pleasure to speak to you.
[01:18:12.977 --> 01:18:13.877]  Longtime listener.
[01:18:14.938 --> 01:18:18.040]  I've been listening to you since probably about 2008 after the housing bubble.
[01:18:18.618 --> 01:18:20.899]  Well, I took a lot of points from you then.
[01:18:21.519 --> 01:18:22.639]  Made a lot of preparations.
[01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:28.861]  Took a bit of a hiatus for a few years and came back in 2020 when everything kind of hit the fan there.
[01:18:29.761 --> 01:18:40.485]  With regards to Canadian gun confiscation and all that, despite popular American opinion, there's probably about a million gun owners in Canada and at least 100,000 AR-15s.
[01:18:42.970 --> 01:18:58.654]  So, back in 2020 when Justin Trudeau initially tried to, uh, do some sort of gun confiscation ban, uh, government intervention in that regard, he, uh, went after about 1,500 rifles, including the AR-15.
[01:18:59.314 --> 01:19:09.777]  So there's a lot of gun owners up here that I don't think are handing back their firearms, and I don't think any of this new stuff is gonna really cause anybody to turn in what they have.
[01:19:11.306 --> 01:19:11.867]  Absolutely.
[01:19:11.887 --> 01:19:19.152]  It just shows the dictator inclination to take away speech, to take away guns, and then he literally takes orders from the WEF.
[01:19:19.552 --> 01:19:21.454]  That's enough right there to remove him from office.
[01:19:22.625 --> 01:19:24.867]  Well, he's clearly not working for the best interest of Canada.
[01:19:25.187 --> 01:19:26.568]  He hasn't been since he was elected.
[01:19:26.808 --> 01:19:31.051]  I'd be surprised if many of the Prime Ministers in the past 20 years have been working in the best interest of Canada.
[01:19:31.831 --> 01:19:34.473]  All parties are fraudulent at this point.
[01:19:35.534 --> 01:19:36.875]  Well, he's a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[01:19:36.895 --> 01:19:38.996]  He's the party boy, the nice guy, friendly.
[01:19:39.457 --> 01:19:46.242]  No, he's a globalist tool to set the precedent worldwide for getting rid of speech and people's right to defense and for permanent lockdowns.
[01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:49.604]  The man is a globalist dictator in your country.
[01:19:50.444 --> 01:19:52.505]  Well, you're the perfect Manchurian candidate for this country.
[01:19:53.426 --> 01:19:54.647]  Remember, Hitler was elected.
[01:19:54.867 --> 01:19:55.327]  Absolutely.
[01:19:55.367 --> 01:19:56.088]  Hitler was elected.
[01:19:56.108 --> 01:19:58.309]  Well, you think this will be a big wake-up call for Canadians?
[01:19:59.810 --> 01:20:00.231]  I don't know.
[01:20:00.371 --> 01:20:01.711]  I live in a pretty blue area.
[01:20:02.712 --> 01:20:06.915]  I don't see much, like, blue in regards to American politics.
[01:20:06.975 --> 01:20:09.176]  Alright, well, David, thank you and be safe and God bless you.
[01:20:09.216 --> 01:20:10.717]  Canada is a warning for all of us.
[01:20:10.978 --> 01:20:11.918]  A canary in the coal mine.
[01:20:11.938 --> 01:20:12.499]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:12.879 --> 01:20:14.220]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:17.402]  There's a new report up with video of it actually happening.
[01:20:18.166 --> 01:20:21.087]  On Infowars.com by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:20:22.667 --> 01:20:27.128]  Schools are making children eat bugs in climate change brainwashing experiment.
[01:20:28.668 --> 01:20:34.029]  You will have nothing, you will own nothing, you will drink sewage, you will eat bugs, and now it's all over the news.
[01:20:34.770 --> 01:20:41.151]  And making boys go into girls bathrooms under the Biden administration's directives or they'll cut off federal funding to schools.
[01:20:41.191 --> 01:20:45.512]  This is all an exercise in pure evil, but we are fighting back.
[01:20:46.212 --> 01:20:48.593]  I'm going to go right back to your phone calls, but I'm going to say it again.
[01:20:49.454 --> 01:20:56.757]  It is your last chance to get one of the coins from the three-part founding member series at 1776coin.com.
[01:20:57.297 --> 01:20:58.578]  You can carry this coin with you.
[01:20:58.618 --> 01:20:59.698]  You can mount it to the wall.
[01:21:00.199 --> 01:21:06.662]  It is historic, and it means you are the tip of the spear funding the resistance against the New World Order and keeping us on air.
[01:21:06.682 --> 01:21:11.124]  Get yours before they sell out at 1776coin.com.
[01:21:11.164 --> 01:21:14.425]  And please, again, continue to spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:21:14.465 --> 01:21:15.226]  That is so critical.
[01:21:15.746 --> 01:21:20.369]  All right, Jay, Don and Gloria, we're going to go to you and then come back with a special guest next hour.
[01:21:20.389 --> 01:21:29.734]  And I'm working on getting Roger Stone on about the Sussman not guilty verdict, because those lies got him SWAT teamed and they were going to put him in prison.
[01:21:30.715 --> 01:21:31.995]  And they tried to set me up.
[01:21:35.917 --> 01:21:36.398]  Incredible.
[01:21:37.358 --> 01:21:38.859]  Right now, let's go to Gloria.
[01:21:39.419 --> 01:21:41.261]  Gloria in Michigan, thanks for calling.
[01:21:43.302 --> 01:21:43.482]  Hi.
[01:21:44.941 --> 01:21:53.264]  Well, I guess my thing is the only reason they're trying to take our guns is because they don't want you to fight back what's coming next.
[01:21:53.484 --> 01:21:55.145]  Well, you just said the big thing out loud.
[01:21:55.245 --> 01:21:56.105]  I mean, I mean, that's it.
[01:21:57.586 --> 01:22:01.007]  Lockdowns, total control, martial law, never letting you out of your house.
[01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:02.287]  That's their admitted plan.
[01:22:02.307 --> 01:22:06.089]  So, of course, they want the guns because they know people will finally get desperate.
[01:22:06.109 --> 01:22:06.509]  Exactly.
[01:22:08.035 --> 01:22:09.457]  Yeah, I mean, I've been here since the beginning.
[01:22:09.477 --> 01:22:11.860]  I was hoping maybe you could put me in Talks About Liberty, man.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:29.799]   I have so much, like, from the beginning, you know, two years ago, witnessing it all in the nursing home, and just the censorship online when people would try to tell you what's going on, and so just everything that's happening leading up to the Mark of the Beast, to the You know, like these are old enemies we've been fighting for a long time, you know?
[01:22:29.999 --> 01:22:30.980]  And they're making their move.
[01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:31.940]  Lock you down.
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:33.500]  Not give you access to medical care.
[01:22:33.561 --> 01:22:34.561]  Block therapeutics.
[01:22:34.861 --> 01:22:37.822]  Not let you see your old folks while they ship COVID patients in.
[01:22:38.102 --> 01:22:38.802]  Censoring you.
[01:22:39.082 --> 01:22:39.943]  Silencing you.
[01:22:40.143 --> 01:22:41.423]  And now coming for your guns.
[01:22:41.483 --> 01:22:42.424]  Coming for your children.
[01:22:42.664 --> 01:22:43.624]  Coming for your currency.
[01:22:43.664 --> 01:22:44.624]  Coming for your retirement.
[01:22:44.864 --> 01:22:51.146]  Coming for everything and the Great Reset to collapse us and make us all poor so they can dictate the terms of our submission.
[01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:54.147]  That's it in a nutshell.
[01:22:54.528 --> 01:22:55.148]  Exactly.
[01:22:56.024 --> 01:22:59.907]  Well, would you like to, when we have whistleblowers on, we can protect your identity.
[01:23:00.227 --> 01:23:07.092]  We need to confirm who you are, but if you'd like to send us information and come on as a guest and tell us what you saw in the nursing home, we would love to have you on.
[01:23:08.052 --> 01:23:14.056]  Yes, like you said, I've got legal battles to fight and we're all fighting how we can.
[01:23:14.337 --> 01:23:15.217]  So yes, I would love to.
[01:23:15.377 --> 01:23:17.499]  I have so much to share.
[01:23:18.137 --> 01:23:18.537]  Beautiful.
[01:23:18.557 --> 01:23:19.438]  We'll put you on hold.
[01:23:19.498 --> 01:23:20.358]  God bless you, Gloria.
[01:23:20.798 --> 01:23:23.880]  See if she wants to come on as a guest and it's proof that she works where she works.
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.441]  We won't sit on air and then have her on as a whistleblower.
[01:23:26.741 --> 01:23:30.023]  Because I'm intending to do more of those shows we haven't done in like four or five months.
[01:23:30.743 --> 01:23:33.224]  Or open the phones up for people to tell their COVID vaccine story.
[01:23:33.605 --> 01:23:35.566]  Or what they witnessed in the nursing homes and medical centers.
[01:23:35.666 --> 01:23:36.146]  Incredible.
[01:23:36.206 --> 01:23:37.266]  Hours of nightmares.
[01:23:38.467 --> 01:23:39.347]  We're not screening calls.
[01:23:39.387 --> 01:23:41.869]  People are welcome to call them with their stories of how great it is.
[01:23:42.269 --> 01:23:44.430]  No one calls in to say how good it is.
[01:23:45.902 --> 01:23:48.163]  Gloria, you'll be one of those special guests when we do that.
[01:23:48.183 --> 01:23:50.344]  We'll be doing that some in the near future.
[01:23:51.164 --> 01:23:52.285]  Hell, I might just do it tomorrow.
[01:23:54.666 --> 01:23:55.146]  Incredible.
[01:23:55.306 --> 01:23:57.547]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jay in Georgia.
[01:23:57.607 --> 01:23:58.347]  Jay, you're on the air.
[01:23:58.388 --> 01:23:58.728]  Go ahead.
[01:23:59.908 --> 01:24:01.129]  Hey, Alex Jones, man.
[01:24:01.169 --> 01:24:01.969]  God bless you, brother.
[01:24:02.009 --> 01:24:02.909]  It's great to talk to you.
[01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:04.610]  First-time caller, long-time listener.
[01:24:04.990 --> 01:24:15.275]  I'm an eight-year Marine Corps veteran, and I just want to tell you that when we recognize as a people that tyranny is here, you know, I talked to Owen a few months ago, and we talked about the storm being off the shore.
[01:24:16.098 --> 01:24:17.139]  And now the storm is here.
[01:24:17.739 --> 01:24:18.699]  We see it in Canada.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.020]  We see it around the world.
[01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:26.124]  I've been into war zones where the citizens there did not have weapons and there was nothing they could do about us being there.
[01:24:27.344 --> 01:24:34.428]  You know, what do we think they're going to do, we're going to do, when they come here to put us in a concentration camp?
[01:24:35.249 --> 01:24:37.250]  And what do you think the COVID lockdowns are?
[01:24:37.310 --> 01:24:43.173]  Those are the training wheels for permanent camps they're building all over the world under UN direction, including in America.
[01:24:44.255 --> 01:24:46.937]  And Alex, they're announcing it, I mean, in our face!
[01:24:47.718 --> 01:25:00.487]  Klaus Schwab, the World Economic Forum, all of these jokers are standing up, they're grandstanding, telling us that they are about to do this, and we sit back in la-la land worrying about the Amber Heard and Johnny Depp frickin' trial.
[01:25:00.867 --> 01:25:09.734]  You know, we're distracted by all these other things to keep us off track, because here's the thing, I see in the grocery stores, I'm in the construction business, and I talk to suppliers.
[01:25:10.541 --> 01:25:15.024]  Alex, we can't get electrical boxes for months to build new properties.
[01:25:15.044 --> 01:25:21.029]  They have to order them six to eight months in advance in order to put the electrical box on the side of the house because of the demand.
[01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:24.271]  We got grocery stores that are running out of food.
[01:25:24.952 --> 01:25:27.954]  Our illusion of choice is going away.
[01:25:28.655 --> 01:25:30.616]  They're telling you there's no more baby formula.
[01:25:30.656 --> 01:25:34.097]  They're announcing it in your face, and we're sitting there with a head stuck inside.
[01:25:34.117 --> 01:25:38.499]  I know we're not, but the average American is sitting out there like, oh, it's okay, nothing's wrong.
[01:25:38.579 --> 01:25:50.183]  And Communist China building giant million-person camps is the example, and now Canada, the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, Europe are building permanent camps, which are really going to be for political prisoners, they now admit.
[01:25:50.583 --> 01:25:54.845]  They are coming with an economic collapse, hoping we just surrender.
[01:25:56.013 --> 01:26:07.836]  And Alex, I believe everything that they've done from an AI standpoint, you know, if you look up the charts of 6G, and you can see what 6G is going to bring, 6G being the implant, that's what powers that.
[01:26:08.137 --> 01:26:16.419]  5G was for, you know, the infrastructure, for the industry, the cars, all that, you know, Tesla is not a car company, it's a data collection company.
[01:26:17.701 --> 01:26:20.443]  Social media is nothing more than a data collection company.
[01:26:20.523 --> 01:26:25.267]  You talked about this 10 years ago where they would put your information in packets and they've got you set aside.
[01:26:25.307 --> 01:26:26.528]  They know exactly what you want.
[01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:40.459]  It was to train the coming AI that will be the anti-Christ, in my opinion, spirit that will tell people how they feel and actually tell you how you feel before you even feel it.
[01:26:40.999 --> 01:26:46.501]   It's going to know what you are, how you work, The pilots in the Air Force, they train with AI.
[01:26:46.521 --> 01:26:50.084]  They sit next to it, Alex, while the AI is learning what they do.
[01:26:50.124 --> 01:26:56.089]  The Air Force announced that as soon as that AI can fly just like the pilot, the pilots are gone.
[01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:58.411]  They've announced this last year.
[01:26:58.431 --> 01:27:07.779]  And it's not innovation, because the globalists will be in control of the technocracy, and their armies of robots will be locked in our houses, forced into the metaverse that the WEF announced they run.
[01:27:08.139 --> 01:27:12.003]  It is a nightmare matrix takeover, forcing us into the matrix.
[01:27:13.049 --> 01:27:20.696]  So Alex Jones, when it comes down to the gun grabs people of America, you had better purchase a firearm, whether you like firearms or not.
[01:27:21.136 --> 01:27:23.418]  You better go get one and have it in your house.
[01:27:23.951 --> 01:27:27.853]  And I would advise people, what the left really wants to shut down is gun shows.
[01:27:28.294 --> 01:27:34.237]  ATF is at these trying to say, I'm a gun dealer, but I'm going to sell you this off record.
[01:27:34.277 --> 01:27:34.858]  That's illegal.
[01:27:35.298 --> 01:27:37.659]  But private sellers, they're selling their private gun.
[01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:40.561]  You're allowed to buy it from them if you're not a felon.
[01:27:40.861 --> 01:27:42.062]  So make sure you follow the laws.
[01:27:42.102 --> 01:27:46.144]  But particularly, people need to get guns that are not on the radar.
[01:27:47.245 --> 01:27:47.725]  Right.
[01:27:48.066 --> 01:27:53.629]  And when we have taxation without representation right now, which it should be a glaring alarm to everybody in America.
[01:27:54.471 --> 01:28:11.377]  When you have representatives in this country, in our government, all the way down to the sheriffs, who are not protecting their oath, I'm going into my next city council meeting and I'm going to demand that every one of them swear and retake their oath of office.
[01:28:11.477 --> 01:28:14.257]   If not, They need to resign immediately.
[01:28:14.257 --> 01:28:17.657]  And by the way, Jay, what you're saying is absolutely key.
[01:28:17.657 --> 01:28:23.557]   If everybody goes into city councils, particularly veterans, and lays out this martial law takeover in the WEF
[01:28:23.557 --> 01:28:28.157]   and demands they swear allegiance to the Republic, it'll wake up the public, the videos will go viral.
[01:28:28.157 --> 01:28:31.557]  So when you do it, send us the video at showtips@infowars.com.
[01:28:31.557 --> 01:28:33.157]  Everybody should be doing that now.
[01:28:33.157 --> 01:28:35.858]   It's one of the best venues to get the word out for the average person.
[01:28:35.858 --> 01:28:36.757]  God bless you.
[01:28:36.757 --> 01:28:38.757]  Don't need internet, don't need infrastructure, nothing.
[01:28:38.804 --> 01:28:41.784]  Just go speak at county commissions, city council, school boards.
[01:28:42.004 --> 01:28:43.145]  They're so scared of you doing that.
[01:28:43.605 --> 01:28:44.265]  One more call.
[01:28:44.665 --> 01:28:45.745]  Don in Ohio.
[01:28:45.785 --> 01:28:46.606]  Don, thanks for holding.
[01:28:47.846 --> 01:28:48.606]  Oh, no problem Alex.
[01:28:48.626 --> 01:28:49.246]  How are you doing?
[01:28:49.306 --> 01:28:49.827]  I'm alright.
[01:28:51.207 --> 01:28:53.668]  Alright, so I'm calling about the Justin Trudeau gun grant.
[01:28:54.268 --> 01:28:55.108]  So here's what I think.
[01:28:55.768 --> 01:28:59.329]  We always have, when America has a plan, we do a test run.
[01:28:59.749 --> 01:29:01.790]  So obviously, Canada has a test run right now.
[01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:05.071]  They're gonna see how things go, and obviously it's gonna come here.
[01:29:05.451 --> 01:29:06.211]  So here's what I think.
[01:29:06.972 --> 01:29:09.834]  Our left-wing politicians and media are forgetting about.
[01:29:09.854 --> 01:29:12.196]  There's a lot of gang members in Cleveland.
[01:29:12.216 --> 01:29:13.597]  I live by them all.
[01:29:13.777 --> 01:29:14.998]  And they're all catching wind of it.
[01:29:15.819 --> 01:29:17.120]  They're all hearing about your show.
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:20.903]  I see guys that I would never expect listening to your show.
[01:29:21.864 --> 01:29:22.684]  And they know who you are.
[01:29:22.704 --> 01:29:24.265]  I mean, they know everything you talk about.
[01:29:25.286 --> 01:29:30.110]  I think these guys are going to be the way that Americans group up together and organize.
[01:29:31.191 --> 01:29:32.212]  And I don't think they're going to wait.
[01:29:32.492 --> 01:29:35.374]  You know, when you ask them, you know, what's the plan?
[01:29:35.654 --> 01:29:36.575]  They want Biden out.
[01:29:37.662 --> 01:29:40.626]  So what do we do if they do it before we do it?
[01:29:41.387 --> 01:29:42.529]  If it gets out of control?
[01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:45.350]  And these guys really do something like this.
[01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:50.350]   Well that's Klaus Schwab's plan is to make things so insane everybody just gets confused and gives up.
[01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:55.350]   They're going to bring in the new world cashless society, the robots, universal basic income, it's all been announced.
[01:29:55.350 --> 01:30:03.350]   Well I hope that doesn't happen because it, I mean all together you've got tens of millions of these.
[01:30:03.475 --> 01:30:07.919]  Well, you just said the good news is that you're now talking to folks all over there listening to the show that weren't before.
[01:30:08.319 --> 01:30:09.540]  Just keep doing the word of mouth.
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:10.521]  Tell them keep doing it.
[01:30:10.841 --> 01:30:12.163]  It'll create the chain reaction.
[01:30:12.463 --> 01:30:14.104]  I'm not risking my life for nothing.
[01:30:14.204 --> 01:30:15.526]  I know we can turn this back.
[01:30:15.826 --> 01:30:19.649]  The Bible tells us it will happen, and we're going to do it, my brother.
[01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:20.490]  God bless you, Don.
[01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:21.011]  All right.
[01:30:22.315 --> 01:30:23.356]  Great, we took a lot of calls.
[01:30:23.396 --> 01:30:24.837]  Took like ten calls in two segments.
[01:30:25.218 --> 01:30:26.579]  Bravo to the listeners and everybody.
[01:30:26.859 --> 01:30:27.640]  Powerful info.
[01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:31.303]  Now, special guest I'll tell you about when we come back and start the next hour.
[01:30:31.864 --> 01:30:33.325]  Talk about ways to protect yourself.
[01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:34.286]  Talk about ways to win.
[01:30:34.566 --> 01:30:36.608]  Talk about ways to not let the globalists destroy you.
[01:30:36.909 --> 01:30:37.930]  It's coming up next hour.
[01:30:37.950 --> 01:30:40.692]  We're trying to get Roger Stone to pop in on the suspense verdict as well.
[01:30:41.033 --> 01:30:42.334]  Hour number three, straight ahead.
[01:30:42.654 --> 01:30:55.054]  Come on folks, tune in!
[01:30:55.054 --> 01:31:05.054]  [BLANK_AUDIO]

[01:31:55.372 --> 01:31:58.153]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[01:31:58.313 --> 01:31:59.333]  Let me think, just let me think.
[01:31:59.353 --> 01:32:04.876]  In fact, even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[01:32:04.896 --> 01:32:06.296]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[01:32:06.316 --> 01:32:06.916]  Damn it!
[01:32:06.976 --> 01:32:07.297]  Why?
[01:32:08.037 --> 01:32:17.449]   Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will learn.
[01:32:20.998 --> 01:32:25.361]  There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[01:32:25.421 --> 01:32:26.382]  You decided, sir.
[01:32:26.442 --> 01:32:27.362]  You wanted it foolproof.
[01:32:27.382 --> 01:32:28.844]  You taught me every television in London!
[01:32:29.044 --> 01:32:31.265]  Cruelty and injustice.
[01:32:31.305 --> 01:32:32.546]  Intolerance and oppression.
[01:32:32.946 --> 01:32:42.853]  And where once you had the freedom to object and think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[01:32:42.873 --> 01:32:43.614]  We need cameras.
[01:32:43.794 --> 01:32:45.175]  How did this happen?
[01:32:45.235 --> 01:32:45.976]  Who's to blame?
[01:32:46.936 --> 01:32:49.640]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:51.642]  They will be held accountable.
[01:32:52.003 --> 01:32:57.430]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:32:58.624 --> 01:33:00.425]  I know why you did it.
[01:33:00.605 --> 01:33:02.907]  I know you were afraid, cooling me.
[01:33:03.347 --> 01:33:05.829]  War, terror, disease.
[01:33:06.049 --> 01:33:12.413]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:33:12.493 --> 01:33:18.197]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[01:33:18.677 --> 01:33:25.677]   He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:33:25.677 --> 01:33:33.677]  There is a war in the world.
[01:33:33.472 --> 01:33:34.473]  It's happening now.
[01:33:35.315 --> 01:33:37.118]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:33:37.658 --> 01:33:39.481]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:33:40.283 --> 01:33:41.745]  We are the resistance.
[01:33:41.985 --> 01:33:43.985]  We are the InfoWar.

[01:33:54.985 --> 01:33:57.985]  don't tell your supporters, don't be afraid of COVID.
[01:33:58.596 --> 01:34:00.697]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[01:34:01.897 --> 01:34:14.359]  Don't tell your supporters, don't be afraid of COVID.
[01:34:14.619 --> 01:34:16.759]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[01:34:16.959 --> 01:34:25.774]   Everyone should be afraid I just want to say they gave me Regeneron.
[01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:29.378]  We have hundreds of thousands of doses that are just about ready.
[01:34:29.858 --> 01:34:35.524]  And if you're in the hospital and you're feeling really bad, we're going to work it so that you get them and you're going to get them free.
[01:34:35.725 --> 01:34:37.725]  And especially if you're a senior, we're gonna do this.

[01:34:52.725 --> 01:34:54.725]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[01:34:54.725 --> 01:34:56.725]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID.
[01:34:56.725 --> 01:34:58.725]  [SCREAMING]
[01:34:58.725 --> 01:35:00.725]  [SCREAMING]
[01:35:00.725 --> 01:35:02.725]  [SCREAMING]
[01:35:02.737 --> 01:35:05.139]  Is there no one who can tell them don't do this?
[01:35:06.298 --> 01:35:14.805]  The young generation, like Prime Minister Trudeau, half of this government, are actually young global leaders of the world economy.
[01:35:15.005 --> 01:35:19.649]  So if we penetrate the cabinets, the change is not just happening.
[01:35:20.710 --> 01:35:24.513]  The change can be shaped by us.
[01:35:25.254 --> 01:35:27.716]  We have to prepare for a more angry world.
[01:35:28.176 --> 01:35:29.117]  How to prepare?
[01:35:29.297 --> 01:35:32.420]  To take the necessary action to create a fairer world.
[01:35:35.525 --> 01:35:37.246]  I see the need for a great reset.
[01:35:37.987 --> 01:35:45.071]  So people assume we are just going back to the good old world which we had and everything will be normal again.
[01:35:45.091 --> 01:35:48.293]  This is, let's say, fiction.
[01:35:48.733 --> 01:35:49.634]  It will not happen.
[01:35:50.114 --> 01:35:53.717]  There is only one way this pandemic is going to go.
[01:35:54.497 --> 01:35:57.599]  It's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:35:58.179 --> 01:36:00.341]  Pay insufficient attention.
[01:36:01.201 --> 01:36:18.836]  To the frightening scenario of a comprehensive cyber attack which would bring to a complete halt to the power supply, transportation, hospital services, our society as a whole.
[01:36:18.735 --> 01:36:29.735]   The COVID-19 crisis would be seen in this respect as a small disturbance in comparison to a major cyber attack.
[01:36:29.735 --> 01:36:47.735]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are in a position to say, "This has a strong effect."
[01:36:47.735 --> 01:36:57.735]   Well, President Trump has released a statement after a jury stacked with DNC activists found Hillary Clinton's lawyer
[01:36:57.735 --> 01:37:04.735]   not guilty of creating the Russiagate hoax and lying to the FBI.
[01:37:05.186 --> 01:37:10.146]  Here's Trump's statement on Truth Social.
[01:37:10.146 --> 01:37:11.565]  Our legal system is corrupt.
[01:37:11.565 --> 01:37:16.445]   Our judges and justices are highly partisan, compromised, or just plain scared.
[01:37:16.445 --> 01:37:20.506]   Our borders are open, our elections are rigged, inflation is rampant, gas prices and food
[01:37:20.506 --> 01:37:25.146]   costs are through the roof, our military leadership is woke, our country is going to hell, and
[01:37:25.146 --> 01:37:27.025]  Michael Sussman is not guilty.
[01:37:27.025 --> 01:37:29.306]  How's everything else doing?
[01:37:29.306 --> 01:37:34.065]  Enjoy your day.
[01:37:34.065 --> 01:37:37.225]  And we've given $60 billion to Nazis.
[01:37:37.172 --> 01:37:40.615]  Azov battalion drops neo-Nazi symbol exploited by Russian propagandist.
[01:37:41.977 --> 01:37:42.077]  Oh.
[01:37:44.919 --> 01:37:45.380]  Incredible.
[01:37:47.181 --> 01:37:48.943]  But he's been a very busy man.
[01:37:49.443 --> 01:38:01.723]   I've been trying to get him on for two weeks, but he's been so busy with the big law firms they've got across the United States have been in their offices and Los Angeles was five, six beautiful floors of CPAs and lawyers.
[01:38:02.504 --> 01:38:11.489]  And what's so important about this is, the system created loopholes when they passed the income tax in 1913, and they changed it every couple years.
[01:38:12.069 --> 01:38:17.652]  Where when you hear about, Jeff Bezos pays zero taxes, but makes $30 billion a year.
[01:38:18.493 --> 01:38:25.477]  Or when you hear Elon Musketing criticize he wasn't paying taxes, he said, all right, well all the other billionaires aren't, but I'll go ahead and pay $16 billion.
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:28.080]  Because I want jobs in America.
[01:38:28.981 --> 01:38:30.181]  He actually builds factories here.
[01:38:30.822 --> 01:38:31.522]  I'm saying he's perfect.
[01:38:32.222 --> 01:38:35.463]  And you read about Google pays 1% tax in all of this.
[01:38:35.483 --> 01:38:38.164]  They've got it all set up where they basically pay nothing.
[01:38:38.945 --> 01:38:44.567]  Now, if you don't write the laws, you don't get the same thing they get where they write them for themselves.
[01:38:45.267 --> 01:38:53.570]  But there's the next level right below that, and you can go to law firms and pay them huge amounts of money, and they do this assessment and drag it on for months and charge you huge amounts of money.
[01:38:54.010 --> 01:39:08.930]   The reason we have American tax solutions Is because they give great advice, they look at your returns, they look at your history, and quickly, in days or a week or so, give you an answer and sign on to it so you're protected.
[01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:15.938]  It's not just tax forgivance, it's not just getting your tax bill cut by 90%, it's not just getting your passport back if you've got back taxes and they revoked it.
[01:39:17.102 --> 01:39:19.366]  It's hundreds of services that they've got.
[01:39:19.546 --> 01:39:20.507]  And I use them.
[01:39:21.349 --> 01:39:21.889]  They're great.
[01:39:22.110 --> 01:39:27.718]  And again, they cut to the chase and then give you a letter signed that they stand behind it.
[01:39:28.419 --> 01:39:29.962]  And then you're protected, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:31.857 --> 01:39:32.837]  This is so important.
[01:39:32.877 --> 01:39:34.938]  So I was sitting here two weeks ago and I said, I want you on.
[01:39:34.958 --> 01:39:37.419]  He said, listen, I'm having to hire more people.
[01:39:37.479 --> 01:39:38.339]  We're going all over.
[01:39:38.359 --> 01:39:41.300]  They were already hiring before they even got them as a sponsor.
[01:39:42.261 --> 01:39:45.882]  And, you know, they've got people like Sean Hannity, you name it, as folks promoting.
[01:39:45.902 --> 01:39:46.842]  So they've been around a long time.
[01:39:46.882 --> 01:39:47.522]  They're big folks.
[01:39:48.023 --> 01:39:49.023]  That's why I knew they were.
[01:39:49.043 --> 01:39:50.043]  I knew they had a great record.
[01:39:50.063 --> 01:39:51.204]  That's why I reached out to them.
[01:39:51.224 --> 01:39:52.604]  They're like, yeah, we're listeners.
[01:39:53.905 --> 01:39:55.165]  We'd love to work with you, Alex.
[01:39:56.645 --> 01:39:57.046]  And so.
[01:39:58.308 --> 01:40:02.811]  Tyler Bennett is a tax professional lawyer and the owner-operator of Tax Reform America Tax Solutions.
[01:40:02.831 --> 01:40:07.134]  When you go to JonesTaxRelief.com, it's their same website, same services.
[01:40:07.674 --> 01:40:12.537]  Then they can just gauge the sponsorship, whether they're going to up the sponsorship or keep it the same.
[01:40:12.597 --> 01:40:13.978]  And they've been upping their sponsorship.
[01:40:14.939 --> 01:40:19.281]  Before we had those Bitcoin donations, we would not have been able to make payroll without their sponsorship.
[01:40:20.435 --> 01:40:28.700]  Tyler Bennett doesn't just have great services that will save you a massive amount of money, but so quick and easy, but it then keeps this broadcast on the air.
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:32.823]  So it's a 360 win, a symbiotic relationship.
[01:40:32.863 --> 01:40:37.867]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:40:38.067 --> 01:40:39.768]  One word, jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:40:41.499 --> 01:40:42.560]  Or call 833-900-4285.
[01:40:42.580 --> 01:40:42.880]  833-900-4285.
[01:40:42.900 --> 01:40:49.343]  We'll put that URL on screen.
[01:40:49.824 --> 01:40:53.225]  JonesTaxRelief.com.
[01:40:55.347 --> 01:40:59.789]  And again, they've had thousands and thousands and thousands of people call up and get their services.
[01:40:59.809 --> 01:41:00.189]  That's great.
[01:41:00.389 --> 01:41:01.890]  We have millions of listeners an hour.
[01:41:02.471 --> 01:41:08.534]  I don't care if you work at a cafeteria, or pump gas, or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[01:41:11.260 --> 01:41:15.582]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[01:41:15.622 --> 01:41:16.362]  You see it every year.
[01:41:16.382 --> 01:41:19.083]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[01:41:19.844 --> 01:41:21.544]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[01:41:22.185 --> 01:41:33.730]  And almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public understanding this and knowing this.
[01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:38.632]  So it's a very important situation with inflation and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[01:41:39.557 --> 01:41:45.001]  To be able to do things tax-wise that's legal and lawful that allows you to keep all your money.
[01:41:45.021 --> 01:41:49.264]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[01:41:49.724 --> 01:41:53.767]  And so this is so important for everybody and I want you to be successful.
[01:41:53.847 --> 01:41:54.787]  I want you to save money.
[01:41:55.348 --> 01:42:00.071]  I don't want you to be bankrupt like the globals want us all to be and on their universal basic income.
[01:42:00.111 --> 01:42:03.253]  So knowing their tricks, knowing their loopholes is beyond critical.
[01:42:03.273 --> 01:42:05.955]  We've got a bunch of current examples of this and a bunch of news.
[01:42:05.995 --> 01:42:08.977]  We're going to be going over with Tyler Bennett joining us today.
[01:42:09.497 --> 01:42:10.677]  Thank you so much for coming on today.
[01:42:11.978 --> 01:42:14.198]  Great to be here, Alex, back on the show.
[01:42:14.778 --> 01:42:15.618]  And you know what?
[01:42:15.879 --> 01:42:21.220]  There's those three trifecta of things that the government has and the globalists have out against you.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:22.240]  It's inflation.
[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:30.502]  And as you mentioned, it is the control, the war on information of knowledge so that you don't have the information you need to make the informed decision.
[01:42:30.942 --> 01:42:37.567]  And then as one of the people who just called in had just mentioned, the third part of it is taxation without representation.
[01:42:37.607 --> 01:42:47.235]  And that is so big because even though our founding fathers started this country based on that concept, no taxation without representation, that's exactly what we have now.
[01:42:47.875 --> 01:42:50.217]  And you really can't do anything about it.
[01:42:50.297 --> 01:42:52.659]  Yes, go down to your local hall.
[01:42:53.179 --> 01:42:55.962]  I say participate in local politics as much as possible.
[01:42:56.242 --> 01:43:00.065]  But at the end of the day, you still have the IRS and the feds to deal with, as well as your state.
[01:43:00.465 --> 01:43:15.797]  And the thing is, if you can't get proper representation because you're not in Congress, you're not connected family-wise to the globalists, what you need is an advocate that's a legal representative who's going to fight for your rights and represent you upon that matter.
[01:43:15.897 --> 01:43:16.697]  That's what we do.
[01:43:17.098 --> 01:43:26.484]   And Alex, it's just like you said, it doesn't matter if you have money, if you don't have any money, you need to make sure you're paying the government Who has admitted that they don't like you.
[01:43:26.564 --> 01:43:27.585]  They want to make you broke.
[01:43:27.625 --> 01:43:35.070]  They want to take away your dream of owning property and you rent so that, you know, they can have their globalist agenda.
[01:43:35.090 --> 01:43:47.937]   And so what we intend to do and what we do for your listeners, for the rest of my clients, Is we provide the options that have typically only been available by the elitist, by the globalist, by those in power.
[01:43:48.257 --> 01:43:49.918]  And we make those options useful, too.
[01:43:50.218 --> 01:43:53.620]  We've talked a lot about corporations already.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:54.600]  We'll talk about that more today.
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:44:04.505]  But what we haven't spoke about yet is a very simple five letter word that, you know, the elitists have been using since the beginning of time to maintain power.
[01:44:04.785 --> 01:44:05.846]  And it's called a trust.
[01:44:05.926 --> 01:44:09.868]   Right now, when you think about a trust right off the bat, You might be bored.
[01:44:09.908 --> 01:44:11.709]  You know, a trust law is so boring.
[01:44:11.749 --> 01:44:12.630]  It's so complex.
[01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:14.130]  Yes, Alex, that's right.
[01:44:14.191 --> 01:44:15.832]  Because think about it.
[01:44:15.892 --> 01:44:26.838]  It's the one information, the more complex they can make something just like the tax laws, then they know you're not going to be able to study and up on it and know what happens when they're screwing you over for their benefit.
[01:44:27.159 --> 01:44:32.202]  So the thing is, this is many people hear the word trust and like, I don't have enough assets to have a trust.
[01:44:32.562 --> 01:44:33.382]  Not the case.
[01:44:33.683 --> 01:44:38.888]   If you have Anything at all, a little amount, a large amount, guess what?
[01:44:38.908 --> 01:44:46.635]  If it's not protected, either the government or somebody else can take it, and that's where a trust comes in to protect you and your family's future from the government.
[01:44:46.655 --> 01:44:51.440]  And you guys are trust experts, not an army of folks ready to do it for whatever people's particular needs are.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:55.925]  Like if somebody's got a gun collection of 10 guns or 100 guns, they need to have those in a trust.
[01:44:57.145 --> 01:44:58.765]  Absolutely, Alex, because you need it.
[01:44:58.986 --> 01:45:03.067]  Honestly, I've said this before is if you're right here, your money is right here.
[01:45:03.107 --> 01:45:06.267]  We need the most amount of space between you and your assets.
[01:45:06.387 --> 01:45:10.469]  And the way we accomplish that is through trust instruments and through corporate instruments.
[01:45:10.989 --> 01:45:12.669]  And again, it depends on what your goal is.
[01:45:12.689 --> 01:45:17.971]  Give us a call and we will get the right bespoke option for you.
[01:45:18.031 --> 01:45:19.831]  I've got people standing by the phones right now.
[01:45:19.871 --> 01:45:20.451]  Give us a call.
[01:45:21.031 --> 01:45:22.392]  If you don't get through, give us a call again.
[01:45:22.412 --> 01:45:35.312]   Alex, like you said, you It's a it's a it's a big it's a big thing we got lots of people calling us and I'm very glad that this is a 360 win for everybody but keep in mind every cent that you pay to the government
[01:45:36.155 --> 01:45:43.097]  Is going to things that you don't believe in, Ukraine, Hunter Biden's legal defense, etc, etc.
[01:45:43.518 --> 01:45:51.280]  So it's your duty as a patriotic American to pay the least amount as possible to the regime, to the globalists.
[01:45:51.660 --> 01:46:01.344]  And we are experts in making that happen, whether it's through a corporate structure or a trust structure or a myriad of the two.
[01:46:01.624 --> 01:46:04.665]  We're also going to talk about adjustment to the give tax to the inflation.
[01:46:05.862 --> 01:46:06.983]  There's so many things.
[01:46:07.023 --> 01:46:10.606]  We're going to be talking about how to protect yourself in inflation, housing exemptions.
[01:46:11.347 --> 01:46:13.568]  We're going to be looking at so many.
[01:46:13.909 --> 01:46:14.689]  There's a bunch of points.
[01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:17.692]  I'm going to shut up when we come back and have you just go through all this, Tyler.
[01:46:17.712 --> 01:46:21.215]  You've really prepared a lot of key info for folks out there.
[01:46:21.255 --> 01:46:25.638]  They need to understand whether they're very wealthy, whether they're middle class, whether you're just a working class person.
[01:46:25.658 --> 01:46:26.259]  It doesn't matter.
[01:46:26.839 --> 01:46:29.461]  There are loopholes and there are tactics.
[01:46:29.481 --> 01:46:30.682]  There are legal things for you to do.
[01:46:30.963 --> 01:46:32.744]  The only way you fail is not taking action.
[01:46:32.764 --> 01:46:33.204]  We'll be right back.
[01:46:34.232 --> 01:46:41.843]  But the globalists always exempt themselves from the injections and the taxes and the rules they put on the rest of us.
[01:46:42.705 --> 01:46:44.648]  And they don't want you to know about that.
[01:46:45.629 --> 01:46:48.073]  Or they want you to pay exorbitant amounts of money for that information.
[01:46:50.011 --> 01:46:51.773]  Well, Tyler Bennett's here with us right now.
[01:46:52.353 --> 01:47:02.202]  And just because tax season's over, now is the time when you've got even more time to really easily, quickly, so simply do really magic things here.
[01:47:02.262 --> 01:47:06.526]  So, Tyler Bennett, you've got a lot of notes here, a lot of big topics you want to share with people.
[01:47:06.546 --> 01:47:09.708]  You're really giving out the secrets to the hat trick here, the card trick here.
[01:47:09.969 --> 01:47:12.091]  Lay it out for us at jonestaxrelief.com.
[01:47:13.929 --> 01:47:14.649]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:47:14.689 --> 01:47:25.253]  So one of the most important things to understand right now about taxation is how inflation, which is the single biggest force in the country right now, is affecting it all.
[01:47:25.513 --> 01:47:28.434]  Because if you don't understand it, you're going to pay more in taxes.
[01:47:28.474 --> 01:47:29.994]  Let me give you a few examples.
[01:47:30.394 --> 01:47:39.982]   So the tax code is indexed for inflation, meaning that the inflation that the Government believes 3% a year or so it goes up that much.
[01:47:40.302 --> 01:47:47.051]  For example, from $11.5 million lifetime exemption, which I'll explain what that means in a second, it's now $12 million.
[01:47:47.271 --> 01:47:53.620]  What that means is your entire life, you can give out $12 million of gifts before it hits your estate.
[01:47:53.900 --> 01:48:01.063]  That's one way, knowing these rules and how it's gone up a little bit, that we can actually feng shui the system and get you to pay the least amount of taxes.
[01:48:01.083 --> 01:48:03.984]  But let me tell you something a little bit more insidious, OK?
[01:48:04.044 --> 01:48:13.628]  Because gift tax is actually indexed for inflation, but there's several provisions of the tax code that affect many people in the middle class.
[01:48:14.088 --> 01:48:17.951]  Everybody that are not in fact indexed for inflation.
[01:48:18.751 --> 01:48:21.013]  For example, housing exemptions, okay?
[01:48:21.092 --> 01:48:26.452]   the housing exemption of a quarter million dollars on your single family or your house
[01:48:26.452 --> 01:48:34.851]   that you live in when you sell it, non-investment just where you live, there is a $250,000 individual
[01:48:34.851 --> 01:48:40.452]   or $500,000 if you're married exemption on the capital gains from that property.
[01:48:40.452 --> 01:48:41.572]  Well here's the thing Alex.
[01:48:41.687 --> 01:48:45.208]  That law was put into place 25 years ago.
[01:48:45.648 --> 01:48:58.674]  And if you do the math between what $250,000 is worth today, it's a lot closer to a million dollars because we've experienced 80% inflation in the last 25 years.
[01:48:59.054 --> 01:49:01.155]  And that has not even been indexed.
[01:49:01.215 --> 01:49:04.556]  It is still the original numbers that they decided in 1997.
[01:49:06.357 --> 01:49:14.323]  Well, I don't think anything happened in 1997 is really relevant now, especially the money and what it was worth before inflation.
[01:49:14.603 --> 01:49:21.748]  So that's one example where if you're if you're not set up correctly, if you don't give me a call and we can make sure we, you know.
[01:49:22.429 --> 01:49:26.852]  Get you in the proper entity in the proper setup proper trust going forward.
[01:49:26.973 --> 01:49:31.196]  You sell that property inflation is going to make sure you pay more in taxes.
[01:49:31.756 --> 01:49:32.597]  So that's one example.
[01:49:32.837 --> 01:49:52.854]   Here's another example that hits a lot of our older audience members here is if you're receiving Social Security, you know that if you receive more than $25,000 a year in addition to that your Social Security which you already paid 10 years of paying into the system to get becomes taxable and at that point it's taxed at 50%.
[01:49:53.634 --> 01:50:03.544]  That again is another provision in the tax code that has existed since 1997 with no changes to that provision.
[01:50:03.824 --> 01:50:10.571]  With people on Social Security who have paid into the system, it's kind of adding insult to injury to say they owe taxes on that.
[01:50:11.031 --> 01:50:20.355]  On top of it, but that again is another one of these things that many people probably just pay and don't actually know that we can help you out with that with the proper entity setup.
[01:50:20.755 --> 01:50:22.636]  So here's the other thing is the states.
[01:50:22.976 --> 01:50:23.837]  The states are no better.
[01:50:24.077 --> 01:50:30.700]  OK, 41 out of 50 states do not index their their tax rates for inflation at all.
[01:50:31.140 --> 01:50:31.520]  Any of them.
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:32.921]  Now, there are nine states that do.
[01:50:32.961 --> 01:50:36.622]  But clearly, as I'm telling you, they base it on the IRS.
[01:50:36.842 --> 01:50:37.883]  And so we're behind.
[01:50:38.403 --> 01:50:55.112]  So you got it the only way out of that problem is to pay a flat tax rate because if you're paying a flat tax rate doesn't matter how much how devalue the US currency is that means you're paying the same amount in taxes when it's when you're when you're in a graduated rate system.
[01:50:55.852 --> 01:51:10.049]  Then if the rate of inflation does not go up at the same amount, you're necessarily paying more in taxes while you make the same amount of money, which is worth less, as you know, when you go into the gas station or go to buy a gallon of milk.
[01:51:10.369 --> 01:51:12.132]  So it's certainly hitting you from two ways.
[01:51:12.512 --> 01:51:15.596]  And it's very important that you know these things.
[01:51:16.196 --> 01:51:17.238]  So that we can help you.
[01:51:17.278 --> 01:51:19.680]  Because awareness of the problem is the first step.
[01:51:20.181 --> 01:51:23.505]  Then you can get someone in your corner to fight, okay?
[01:51:23.905 --> 01:51:27.309]  If you got Mike Tyson, the IRS, in the other side of the corner, okay?
[01:51:27.790 --> 01:51:29.011]  You don't want to stand up to them alone.
[01:51:29.112 --> 01:51:31.494]  You need a boxer that's bigger, better, and you're going to take them out.
[01:51:31.735 --> 01:51:33.557]  And that's where we step into the picture.
[01:51:34.057 --> 01:51:37.658]  So listen, that's what smart tax planning is all about.
[01:51:37.678 --> 01:51:51.722]  OK, it's knowing how not just the tax code is changing every year in preparing for it, but also how other economic events such as inflation, such as the changing laws play into that as well.
[01:51:52.322 --> 01:51:55.983]  And what we can do here is absolutely make sure you pay less.
[01:51:56.949 --> 01:52:05.533]  If all I really need is you give me your tax return you filed out last year, I will show you all the spots where we could have taken advantage of and will do next year.
[01:52:05.553 --> 01:52:10.096]  And then you're going to ask why your CPA or law firm didn't do that when it's the law.
[01:52:10.536 --> 01:52:12.297]  Why don't they do that, Tyler?
[01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:17.773]  The reason that they don't do it is because most CPAs are risk adverse.
[01:52:17.813 --> 01:52:31.961]  That means when the IRS does their IRM, the Internal Revenue Manual Bulletin every year, they go off of those things that the IRS is saying, this is what our non-lawyers have interpreted the law to be.
[01:52:32.781 --> 01:52:38.383]  That's what I've been told by top CPAs here in Austin that have given me the same advice you've given me.
[01:52:38.823 --> 01:52:40.864]  They said, look, the whole IRS is social engineering.
[01:52:40.884 --> 01:52:41.884]  It doesn't even run the country.
[01:52:42.184 --> 01:52:43.025]  They just print the money.
[01:52:43.365 --> 01:52:46.786]  This is so the rich and powerful can buy everything up.
[01:52:46.826 --> 01:52:52.148]  And so the public is basically being sapped to keep us non-competitive and consolidate control.
[01:52:52.168 --> 01:52:53.888]  That's basically feudalism.
[01:52:54.408 --> 01:52:59.368]   And so the IRS puts out this report and says, well, we don't like this, we don't like that.
[01:52:59.368 --> 01:53:02.606]   Even though it's the law and people go, oh, well, the bully says,
[01:53:02.606 --> 01:53:04.667]  I don't get the same law as the elite.
[01:53:04.667 --> 01:53:07.448]   And then they just screw you over because you don't have knowledge.
[01:53:07.448 --> 01:53:08.568]  It's totally sick.
[01:53:08.568 --> 01:53:10.288]  It's totally evil.
[01:53:11.274 --> 01:53:25.668]  So your average tax preparer or CPA firm, tax prep firm, when that IRM bulletin comes out, they are going to look at it and they're not, you know, CPAs by their nature are not advocates.
[01:53:25.828 --> 01:53:27.290]  They are risk adverse.
[01:53:27.570 --> 01:53:32.195]  They just want to get the return done and not get in trouble themselves.
[01:53:32.555 --> 01:53:35.517]  They don't care about making sure you have the least amount of taxes paid.
[01:53:35.817 --> 01:53:48.803]  That's where an advocate, a tax attorney, comes into the picture because what a tax attorney does, what we do, is we don't care what the IRS, what some clerk down there interpreted the Internal Revenue Manual to be.
[01:53:49.243 --> 01:53:55.266]  We know what the actual law is and we will assert your rights because it's your right as a taxpayer to not pay one penny more than you owe.
[01:53:56.447 --> 01:54:00.806]   the chase. A lot of law firms, you've got CPH2, kind of drag you through, milk you,
[01:54:00.806 --> 01:54:05.407]   do all this stuff. In most cases, you just look at right away where they can save money
[01:54:05.407 --> 01:54:10.286]   and then they legally lawfully do it and then you guys just get a percentage of it basically.
[01:54:10.286 --> 01:54:15.006]   Right. So when you call us, basically we're going to let you know what your situation
[01:54:15.006 --> 01:54:20.207]   is, how we can help and what we, you know, our attorneys over here think the best way
[01:54:20.892 --> 01:54:23.374]  It's up to you if you want to make that move or not.
[01:54:23.634 --> 01:54:35.041]  But what I'm telling you is for you, me, and everyone in the audience, it would not make sense to pay, you know, people who admit openly that they hate you, and give them your money, okay?
[01:54:35.061 --> 01:54:36.843]  Let's expand on this, we're going to break, but this is key.
[01:54:37.623 --> 01:54:43.625]  You guys routinely get 90% back tax forgivance just because your lawyers are not a call to negotiate.
[01:54:43.865 --> 01:54:49.886]  That's just one of the services, but that's one that everybody is the penalties and interest are piling up should be calling you and doing that.
[01:54:49.926 --> 01:54:52.547]  If you try to negotiate, it's going to be terrible.
[01:54:52.567 --> 01:54:53.187]  We'll be right back.
[01:54:53.207 --> 01:54:53.647]  Stay with us.
[01:54:53.868 --> 01:54:54.928]  This is secret info.
[01:54:56.628 --> 01:54:58.729]  There's been another mass shooting in a high school.
[01:54:58.749 --> 01:54:59.929]  We're getting the tales right now.
[01:54:59.949 --> 01:55:01.330]  So does that get it?
[01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:02.330]  I'll break it here on air.
[01:55:04.383 --> 01:55:05.644]  True tragedies are around us.
[01:55:05.664 --> 01:55:07.106]  That's the reason we need good guys with guns.
[01:55:07.146 --> 01:55:08.367]  Protect us from bad people with guns.
[01:55:08.988 --> 01:55:11.911]  But we have Tyler Bennett, who is a great tax lawyer.
[01:55:11.951 --> 01:55:12.972]  Cuts right to the chase.
[01:55:13.793 --> 01:55:14.513]  It's who I use.
[01:55:14.593 --> 01:55:16.695]  It's who you should use, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:16.715 --> 01:55:17.977]  And it's a 360 win.
[01:55:18.537 --> 01:55:24.537]   Tomorrow's news today, I never steer people wrong, they stand behind this.
[01:55:24.537 --> 01:55:28.617]   They literally stand behind what they tell you and cut right to the chase and save you
[01:55:28.617 --> 01:55:29.617]  so much money.
[01:55:29.617 --> 01:55:32.376]  Hundreds of different options they can do for anybody.
[01:55:32.376 --> 01:55:36.976]   Go to jonestaxrelief.com, that takes you right to American Tax Relief and that way we get
[01:55:36.976 --> 01:55:39.416]  credit and it keeps us on the air at 360WIN.
[01:55:39.416 --> 01:55:42.457]   You're crazy if you don't make the call and get a consultation, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:42.861 --> 01:55:44.143]  American Tax Relief, or 833-900-4285.
[01:55:44.163 --> 01:55:44.203]  833-900-4285.
[01:55:44.243 --> 01:55:45.624]  Tyler Bennett, I'm all ears.
[01:55:45.444 --> 01:55:49.923]  4285 833 900 4285.
[01:55:49.923 --> 01:55:52.163]  Tyler Bennett, I'm all ears, take it away.
[01:55:52.163 --> 01:55:58.043]   All right, Alex, so there's two asset classes that people need to be aware of
[01:55:58.043 --> 01:56:04.384]   and how these asset classes have been used traditionally by the globalists to avoid paying taxes
[01:56:04.384 --> 01:56:09.844]   and how you need to not need to be paying attention to this and if we wanna do it the correct way,
[01:56:09.844 --> 01:56:11.764]  I'm gonna be all over it.
[01:56:11.907 --> 01:56:12.027]  But.
[01:56:12.367 --> 01:56:21.335]  If you do it the wrong way, especially with crypto, we know they've hired 60,000 additional IRS agents just to audit and make your life miserable.
[01:56:21.355 --> 01:56:25.659]  So these two classes are crypto, as I just mentioned, we'll talk about that in a second, and art, okay?
[01:56:26.159 --> 01:56:37.690]  Art, especially original arts, Van Gogh's, Picasso's, this kind of thing, has traditionally been used by the globalists to move around large sums of money to each other within private art sales.
[01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:41.413]  And these kinds of things are not reported because they're private.
[01:56:41.753 --> 01:56:47.458]  And that's how they're able to, you know, illegally, but still get away with it, move around a lot amount of money.
[01:56:47.818 --> 01:56:51.882]  Now, there is a legal way to do this with trust, as I was explaining about before.
[01:56:51.922 --> 01:56:53.243]  We are the McDonald's of trust.
[01:56:53.543 --> 01:56:55.725]  We do them all and we can help you out with there.
[01:56:55.845 --> 01:57:04.493]  But just a little bit of current events is you got Hunter Biden apparently is this major novice artist now trying to sell his work.
[01:57:05.853 --> 01:57:10.995]  And it is gathering some serious potential prices from the buyers, right?
[01:57:11.316 --> 01:57:15.797]  And so why this is obviously an issue is his connection with the government.
[01:57:15.817 --> 01:57:17.798]  Can you buy the government in this country?
[01:57:17.838 --> 01:57:22.680]  Well, it seems like it's becoming cheaper and cheaper for the right people every day.
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:33.444]  So what they said is their solution is, well, we just won't disclose to the president's son or to anybody else how much this art sold for and what it actually sold for.
[01:57:34.024 --> 01:57:39.505]  So they're basically admitting that they're going to do a private sale, and because he's part of the right group, they're not going to pay taxes on it.
[01:57:39.525 --> 01:57:43.066]  Because how can you pay taxes on an amount of money that you don't know that you made?
[01:57:43.486 --> 01:57:44.707]  So it's ridiculous.
[01:57:45.047 --> 01:57:55.329]  The private people, the citizens, the middle class need to be aware that this kind of thing is going on, because yes, of course, there is always true that the globalists have access to things that we don't.
[01:57:55.942 --> 01:58:07.565]  But that doesn't mean that we can't use these same loopholes and trust instruments to have the same outcome for, you know, the art that you might have, the art that your grandma might have up on her wall that's worth a lot of money, right?
[01:58:08.005 --> 01:58:10.326]  So give us a call for that kind of thing.
[01:58:10.346 --> 01:58:13.007]  And here's the other thing that we got to talk about is crypto.
[01:58:13.147 --> 01:58:16.508]  OK, the government is going hard against crypto.
[01:58:16.528 --> 01:58:20.829]  Biden is trying hard to regulate at every step of the chance he gets.
[01:58:21.485 --> 01:58:30.796]  Fortunately, he wants to stuff so much stuff into that Build Better Back Act, it's never going to pass in its current iteration.
[01:58:30.836 --> 01:58:36.703]  So we have to the end of the year at least, I would guess probably till next year too, but I wouldn't take my chances on that.
[01:58:37.063 --> 01:58:40.065]  Use it now is the crypto loopholes here.
[01:58:40.125 --> 01:58:45.449]  We're talking about such things as, you know, you can make crypto from buying and selling the same token.
[01:58:45.689 --> 01:58:48.251]  You can be farming, yield farming.
[01:58:48.271 --> 01:58:50.633]  You can be mining or staking income.
[01:58:50.933 --> 01:58:54.476]  And each of these things is taxed in a slightly different way.
[01:58:55.016 --> 01:58:57.718]  And you have a basis just like stocks and this and that.
[01:58:57.918 --> 01:58:59.800]  Here's the beautiful thing with crypto right now.
[01:59:01.060 --> 01:59:13.166]  Especially if you've been in the game, if you've held crypto for a couple of years or you've been playing with it for a while, even Coinbase, even the institutions that are going to report, they do not know what your basis is.
[01:59:13.206 --> 01:59:18.565]   So instead of sending out 1099 B's like a brokerage firm, they're sending out 1099 MISCs,
[01:59:18.565 --> 01:59:25.885]   which means every dollar that goes through your wallet that gets reported is reported as income to you.
[01:59:25.885 --> 01:59:29.806]   Even if you're just moving around money from one of your accounts to another, right?
[01:59:29.806 --> 01:59:31.206]  It's gonna get reported as income.
[01:59:31.206 --> 01:59:36.806]   So you need somebody who knows that that's the case to report the right basis number for you
[01:59:36.806 --> 01:59:40.766]   so you don't get hit up with additional taxes for money you didn't even make
[01:59:40.766 --> 01:59:44.404]   or positions you haven't sold yet so you don't owe any tax money.
[01:59:44.404 --> 01:59:48.405]   And right now you're consulting with us on the big Bitcoin donations we got.
[01:59:48.405 --> 01:59:52.046]   I told you I want 100% of it to go into funding this operation.
[01:59:52.046 --> 01:59:57.485]   So we're making sure that it goes through that and then any taxes are paid through running the operation,
[01:59:57.485 --> 02:00:00.685]  not paid as if I actually got that money.
[02:00:00.685 --> 02:00:10.685]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:00:01.929 --> 02:00:02.389]  Exactly.
[02:00:02.409 --> 02:00:06.993]  And that's that's that's one example of what we can do to in the crypto field.
[02:00:07.033 --> 02:00:09.155]  And this is the kind of thing that we got to take care of now.
[02:00:09.175 --> 02:00:26.167]  So if you've made a decent chunk of money in crypto in the last year or you have a decent chunk of crypto you've just been holding on to, give me a call, because the wrong thing to do is to check that box on your 1040 that says, I don't have any crypto assets.
[02:00:26.228 --> 02:00:29.110]  Those are the people they're going to go after because they know you're lying.
[02:00:29.170 --> 02:00:30.691]  OK, but don't lie to the government.
[02:00:31.460 --> 02:00:37.841]  We will just tell them exactly what happened, but we're going to paint the lights in your favor, okay?
[02:00:38.081 --> 02:00:44.303]  The government doesn't know what your basis in Ethereum is, so we're going to make one that's a little bit better probably than what they would want it to be.
[02:00:44.603 --> 02:00:45.183]  And guess what?
[02:00:45.223 --> 02:00:49.624]  They're going to accept it because you're reporting the crypto.
[02:00:49.904 --> 02:00:52.644]  That means you're out of the people who they want to audit already.
[02:00:53.044 --> 02:01:00.647]   Because they're going after everybody who thinks they can stay under the radar, You know, the meme of, oh, I lost all my crypto in a shipwreck.
[02:01:00.947 --> 02:01:09.751]  OK, yeah, here's the problem is they they can look in your public address to just like anybody else can and they can see those funds are still there and they don't necessarily need to go after that to attack you.
[02:01:10.171 --> 02:01:14.473]  If you own a house, if you have money in a bank account, they love attacking that because that's a lot.
[02:01:14.713 --> 02:01:16.874]  It's very easy for them to grab money out of a bank account.
[02:01:16.894 --> 02:01:18.695]  So make sure you're protected.
[02:01:19.015 --> 02:01:22.476]  Make sure you're in the right entity structure going forward.
[02:01:22.797 --> 02:01:23.437]  Give me a call.
[02:01:23.457 --> 02:01:43.696]   We can do that if you have crypto assets, because It's just it's just huge right now what Biden is trying to levy on the American people because they believe and this is reported in on not in American news only in BBC Al Jazeera non-American news is the IRS has said that they pretty much believe if you have a sizable amount of cryptocurrency
[02:01:44.674 --> 02:01:46.536]  More chance than not that you're a criminal.
[02:01:46.596 --> 02:01:47.837]  Now that's absurd, right?
[02:01:48.217 --> 02:01:53.121]  But that's the way the government is because they don't care if they violate your rights like I was telling you.
[02:01:53.501 --> 02:01:59.867]  They will do it and you won't be any the wiser because there is no taxation without representation.
[02:02:00.607 --> 02:02:28.539]   If you don't have an advocate to represent you and that's what I'm here to do because it just drives me crazy when I see the IRS and I've seen revenue officers come out now in people's houses and assessments at this point and claiming they owe millions of dollars in crypto when they may not even have that total number of assets because the amount of Like I said, that was $10.99 to him, was $10.99 the wrong way, and your average person isn't going to be able to figure that out.
[02:02:28.699 --> 02:02:34.741]  And the average CPA and even the average lawyer has no idea about crypto.
[02:02:35.341 --> 02:02:40.163]  I know you're really good, but I called three different law firms and they couldn't even give me answers.
[02:02:40.783 --> 02:02:52.983]  On the big crypto donations, but then I what you told me I went and checked and even saw main finance reports again that the average person isn't reading but are in finance journals saying exactly the advice you gave us.
[02:02:54.216 --> 02:02:54.677]  Absolutely.
[02:02:54.717 --> 02:02:59.202]  And here's the thing is, we're in the financial district of downtown LA.
[02:02:59.222 --> 02:03:03.808]  We're right here with Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, all the big accounting firms.
[02:03:03.888 --> 02:03:10.836]  And they will send their potential crypto clients away because they don't want to deal with the potential liability.
[02:03:10.856 --> 02:03:11.437]  They're scared.
[02:03:11.677 --> 02:03:19.762]   They don't want to actually have to act as an advocate for Well, that's the same reason I didn't get involved in it 12 years ago when it was all launching and people tried to give me Max Keiser 10,000 Bitcoins.
[02:03:20.163 --> 02:03:21.783]  I didn't understand it, so I didn't want to get involved.
[02:03:21.843 --> 02:03:23.864]  Now it's here to stay in one way or another.
[02:03:23.964 --> 02:03:24.704]  I need to learn about it.
[02:03:24.764 --> 02:03:25.765]  I need to get engaged in it.
[02:03:26.065 --> 02:03:27.085]  I need to get involved in it.
[02:03:27.966 --> 02:03:29.906]  And so that's what I'm doing in the process.
[02:03:29.966 --> 02:03:30.607]  I'm learning more and more.
[02:03:30.627 --> 02:03:31.247]  It's very interesting.
[02:03:32.526 --> 02:03:46.034]  Absolutely, and I'd recommend the rest of your audience to do the same, because, listen, as we know, if there is an asset class out there, and that's why I brought up ARK, if there is an asset class... And we know the elites are heavily in crypto, heavily in Ethereum and Bitcoin.
[02:03:46.994 --> 02:03:49.836]  That's why... That means it's not going anywhere, folks.
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:51.761]  They want Bitcoin.
[02:03:51.781 --> 02:03:52.501]  They want Ethereum.
[02:03:52.521 --> 02:03:56.244]  They want stuff they know that they can get because they know how to make it disappear.
[02:03:56.264 --> 02:03:58.786]  And is it is what is what they're doing illegal?
[02:03:59.407 --> 02:03:59.727]  Yes.
[02:03:59.847 --> 02:04:00.628]  But here's the thing.
[02:04:00.908 --> 02:04:02.469]  They operate on a different scale.
[02:04:02.509 --> 02:04:04.991]  So what we're going to do is the exact same thing as them.
[02:04:05.011 --> 02:04:09.655]  But we're going to make it legal because we know the right entities and trust setups to get you in.
[02:04:10.595 --> 02:04:12.396]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:04:12.476 --> 02:04:15.358]  All right, Tyler Bennett, I want to come back at a few other key points with you.
[02:04:15.419 --> 02:04:20.702]  Jonestaxrelief.com, Jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285.
[02:04:21.263 --> 02:04:23.024]  Everybody should really be talking to this guy and his team.
[02:04:23.064 --> 02:04:23.784]  They are amazing.
[02:04:23.804 --> 02:04:24.265]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:25.086 --> 02:04:33.952]  All right, one killed, two wounded in a shooting at Morris Jeff High Graduation Ceremony at Xavier University and it's black on black.
[02:04:34.593 --> 02:04:39.776]  Still terrible, but the media always covers those up when those happen because that's such an epidemic.
[02:04:39.936 --> 02:04:40.677]  Very, very sad.
[02:04:42.358 --> 02:04:45.080]  We got some other big breaking news here as well.
[02:04:45.100 --> 02:04:47.862]  70 missing children recovered in West Texas, authorities say.
[02:04:48.342 --> 02:04:49.663]  I'll cover that a little bit in the next hour.
[02:04:51.508 --> 02:04:52.449]  Our special guest host.
[02:04:53.089 --> 02:04:54.270]  Going back to Tyler Bennett.
[02:04:54.790 --> 02:05:00.254]  You know, Tyler, it's so frustrating to me to study the New World Order, to study how they exempt themselves from everything, 100%.
[02:05:02.395 --> 02:05:09.940]  But even for the nouveau riche and the establishment, that next year they have it where they pay 10% of the taxes the general public does on average.
[02:05:11.161 --> 02:05:11.982]  And it's just incredible.
[02:05:12.322 --> 02:05:14.243]  And people need to just do these tactics out of hand.
[02:05:14.303 --> 02:05:14.944]  It's the law.
[02:05:16.089 --> 02:05:19.031]  They want the general public not to know it because they want to not have competition.
[02:05:19.371 --> 02:05:20.472]  They want people to be poor.
[02:05:21.012 --> 02:05:21.953]  And that makes me angry.
[02:05:22.053 --> 02:05:22.893]  I don't want people to be poor.
[02:05:23.614 --> 02:05:34.740]  And so it's just such a no-brainer that everybody needs to call you guys at 833-900-4285, 833-900-4285, jonestaxrelief.com.
[02:05:35.181 --> 02:05:35.961]  Here are the services.

[02:05:40.584 --> 02:05:43.726]  Business entity selection, which is the huge one.

[02:06:19.969 --> 02:06:21.370]  So good to have Tyler Bennett here with us.
[02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:21.930]  Continue, sir.
[02:06:23.596 --> 02:06:37.905]  Alex, it's just like you said, the globalists, the elitists, they have their club, their cabal, and even the nouveau riche, even people who have money, they're not necessarily part of the globalist club, and they don't want you to be part of that club, and you can't be.
[02:06:38.246 --> 02:06:43.829]  So, but here's the thing, is if you do have any assets at all, this is where I want to talk about trusts again.
[02:06:44.170 --> 02:06:52.069]   Trusts were the first thing that existed in this country before corporate law existed, trust law existed,
[02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:56.470]   that allowed for the uber wealthy and even people with any money at all
[02:06:56.470 --> 02:07:00.449]   to protect that from their creditors, to protect it from other people,
[02:07:00.449 --> 02:07:03.069]  and to maintain it for their family, right?
[02:07:03.069 --> 02:07:07.389]   And so here's the thing is, it doesn't matter if you are nouveau riche,
[02:07:07.389 --> 02:07:14.509]   if you are, you know, just have your little old properties in the middle of Virginia, whatever you got,
[02:07:14.509 --> 02:07:18.788]   if you have any property at all, you need to have that protected.
[02:07:18.923 --> 02:07:19.844]  Because here's the thing.
[02:07:20.264 --> 02:07:34.173]  During your lifetime, there will be times when the state and the government and possibly other people are going to come after your assets and try to take what you have hard earned by the sweat of your brow.
[02:07:34.514 --> 02:07:47.143]   And so here's the thing is, if we can separate you from your assets, like I said before, A trust instrument, which there is, you know, hundreds of years of trust law in this country that we can go back on and use.
[02:07:48.124 --> 02:07:54.108]  That's one way to protect anybody out there who is little, big, it doesn't matter.
[02:07:54.489 --> 02:07:58.792]  If you're a little guy out there saying, well, hey, this sounds great, but I don't think I can afford a trust.
[02:07:59.172 --> 02:08:01.094]  Remember, we are the McDonald's of trust.
[02:08:01.414 --> 02:08:02.375]  We pump these things out.
[02:08:02.395 --> 02:08:12.440]  You absolutely can afford one and it will behoove you to do it because let me tell you what you can't afford is having your hard-earned money taken from you when you don't have it properly protected.
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:43.251]   So a trust allows for there's several different types of trust instruments out there and it's bespoke to what Each client needs but what in general the two big goals would be to pay the least amount of taxes yes but also when we're paying the least amount of taxes that's we also want to keep our assets protected keep those assets protected from the government protected from any creditors protected from anyone who may be after your money and that way you can decide what happens to it you can spend it you can
[02:08:43.311 --> 02:08:44.392]  Give it all to your family.
[02:08:44.672 --> 02:08:45.613]  It's your money.
[02:08:45.713 --> 02:08:48.436]  Don't let the government or anyone else have a claim to it.
[02:08:48.736 --> 02:08:50.098]  So let me explain this a little bit.
[02:08:51.299 --> 02:09:07.295]  A trust, and the reason trusts have existed for even British common law before this country was created, is because a trust is a very informalized entity as opposed to a corporation, an LLC, a partnership even.
[02:09:07.695 --> 02:09:14.957]  So, what a trust is, is simply, in its most basic form, is an agreement between three people.
[02:09:16.757 --> 02:09:24.979]  A settler, that means the person who's providing the money into the trust, a beneficiary, the person who receives it, and the trustee, who has control over those funds.
[02:09:25.219 --> 02:09:36.341]  And that is the most important part, because, according to the tax code, even if you receive income, it is not considered taxable income to you until you have dominion over it, until you have that control.
[02:09:37.041 --> 02:09:50.653]  And so if we can separate that out by you still have access to the money, but technically there's a trustee that is in control of it, that is how all these elitists, all the people that you can, I mean, Zuckerberg, all the people that you can think of.
[02:09:50.673 --> 02:09:52.515]  And Tyler, spend a few minutes on the history of trust.
[02:09:52.555 --> 02:09:54.056]  I know some of it, I know you know more.
[02:09:54.557 --> 02:09:57.039]  It's totally legal, they just don't want you to know about it.
[02:09:58.294 --> 02:09:59.195]  Absolutely Alex.
[02:09:59.215 --> 02:10:43.982]   So before corporate law was developed, the idea that people were having massive amounts of gains in the early 18th, 19th century in this country, the railroads for example, the way that people were able to make Maintain this wealth and pass it down generationally and create ruling class families in this country is by creating trust instruments that provided that their money would skip a generation to evade the You know the excuse me inheritance tax and stuff like that and so basically in this country before corporate law was developed around the time the IRS was developed and
[02:10:44.662 --> 02:10:48.984]  It was if you had a successful business, you had a trust that it existed in.
[02:10:49.364 --> 02:10:53.766]  And I'll tell you a little secret is that is absolutely true today still, okay?
[02:10:53.786 --> 02:10:54.726]  Well, exactly.
[02:10:54.766 --> 02:11:03.690]  The Standard Oil Trust, the Rockefellers, the Carnegies, all of them, it's those trusts attacking us today that have trillions of dollars in a black rock.
[02:11:03.770 --> 02:11:05.390]  All those are really just the elite's trust.
[02:11:05.991 --> 02:11:09.572]  And then they just think somebody dies and Grandpa had a half million dollars.
[02:11:10.132 --> 02:11:12.813]  Most of it goes to the government because Grandpa didn't set a trust up.
[02:11:12.893 --> 02:11:13.774]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:11:14.474 --> 02:11:15.816]  That's exactly right.
[02:11:15.997 --> 02:11:19.443]  And so simply by saying... Like a family, maybe the family, maybe grandma's got a hundred acres.
[02:11:20.204 --> 02:11:20.885]  She doesn't know.
[02:11:21.086 --> 02:11:21.627]  She dies.
[02:11:21.667 --> 02:11:22.468]  The government gets it.
[02:11:22.749 --> 02:11:25.614]  She could have just done a trust for a thousand dollars and the family would have got it.
[02:11:26.650 --> 02:11:27.230]  Absolutely.
[02:11:27.550 --> 02:11:30.431]  It really is, you know, that simple.
[02:11:30.651 --> 02:11:34.672]  And we could have a trust set up for you in one phone call.
[02:11:34.692 --> 02:11:36.652]  We have you send out the documents, notarized.
[02:11:36.872 --> 02:11:38.153]  It can happen very quickly.
[02:11:38.593 --> 02:11:46.594]  And the trust is the type of thing that it's like you're never going to, after the fact, be able to put your money into a trust, right?
[02:11:46.654 --> 02:11:50.175]  I mean, it's like playing in the NFL without pads and a helmet.
[02:11:51.035 --> 02:11:53.016]  I mean, the public is not told any of this.
[02:11:54.354 --> 02:11:59.833]   They are not that is correct And that is how those same families the elitist the globalists
[02:11:59.833 --> 02:12:05.994]   stay up because it's a control of information And so the more you know if you just listen to me right now
[02:12:05.994 --> 02:12:10.253]   now you at least know what's happening And so you're better educated and so when the next time
[02:12:10.253 --> 02:12:16.974]   they try to make a move against you you can be prepared Because I mean the thing is is you got to apply the elitist
[02:12:16.974 --> 02:12:20.393]   ideas even though we're both everyone here is an everyday person
[02:12:20.673 --> 02:12:26.314]   Okay, we're not the elitist that does not mean we can't use the same laws that they created a hundred years ago
[02:12:26.314 --> 02:12:35.884]   and try to hide in the back of the IRC with tons of IRM to fluff up and confuse whoever cares to actually take
[02:12:35.884 --> 02:12:39.742]   a look at All right, well, Tyler Bennett, you've got so much more for anybody.
[02:12:39.782 --> 02:12:43.263]  They should call, do a free consultation, talk to you guys.
[02:12:43.303 --> 02:12:45.064]  They need to call now, 833-900-4285, 833-900-4285.
[02:12:45.084 --> 02:12:56.007]  JonesTaxRelief.com just takes you right to the site where they can track how many people come there so they can expand their sponsorship.
[02:12:56.407 --> 02:12:58.968]  They have gone from being a small sponsor to a giant sponsor.
[02:12:59.388 --> 02:13:00.488]  They're critical to what we do.
[02:13:00.608 --> 02:13:02.409]  They have an amazing group of products.
[02:13:02.889 --> 02:13:04.029]  I love Tyler Bennett.
[02:13:04.049 --> 02:13:04.850]  He's such a patriot.
[02:13:04.890 --> 02:13:05.550]  He's so smart.
[02:13:06.150 --> 02:13:07.491]  These are the folks you need to call.
[02:13:07.892 --> 02:13:11.555]  But whatever you do, educate yourself on this and start protecting yourself, whatever you do.
[02:13:12.056 --> 02:13:15.859]  But this is the sure thing, because this is what the establishment has set up for itself.
[02:13:16.140 --> 02:13:18.722]  They think you're too stupid to take action.
[02:13:18.742 --> 02:13:25.288]  I know you're too smart to let these globalists keep screwing you over, so go to jonestaxrelief.com or 833-900-4285.
[02:13:25.328 --> 02:13:29.632]  Tyler Bennett, we'll talk to you soon.
[02:13:29.652 --> 02:13:30.613]  I'm trying to get you to town.
[02:13:31.314 --> 02:13:34.696]  Plus, you've already done some great consulting, but I want you to get over here and help me even more.
[02:13:35.096 --> 02:13:36.918]  Thank you so much, and have a great week, my friend.
[02:13:37.658 --> 02:13:38.619]  You have a great week, too.
[02:13:38.819 --> 02:13:39.479]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:13:40.100 --> 02:13:40.720]  Powerful.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:43.602]  I've done four or five interviews with him, but that one was out of the park.
[02:13:43.622 --> 02:13:44.642]  That's the best interview yet.
[02:13:44.903 --> 02:13:46.724]  We're going to archive this to Band-Odd Video.
[02:13:47.444 --> 02:13:49.485]  Learn how to protect yourself the way the globalists do.
[02:13:49.566 --> 02:13:50.646]  Learn the tricks of the globalists.
[02:13:51.147 --> 02:13:52.908]  I mean, it's just absolutely essential.
[02:13:53.348 --> 02:13:54.188]  We'll be right back.
[02:13:54.268 --> 02:13:55.549]  I'm going to introduce Wayne Allyn Root coming up.
[02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:59.532]  I'm going to talk about this giant 70 children saved out of sex slavery.
[02:14:00.675 --> 02:14:01.775]  I'm not anti-government.
[02:14:02.736 --> 02:14:06.997]  I'm anti-World Economic Forum, globalist, corporate, fascist government.
[02:14:08.597 --> 02:14:19.480]  And they brag at the Nablus Group that their policies through governments they control are discrediting our governments, so that the governments collapse and then we're third world countries, the multinationals can come in and buy up a pennies on the dollar.
[02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:44.854]   So when I see headlines out there that get almost no attention, this should be national news, it's being reported by CBS and ABC out of Houston, That good federal agents, mainly from the Border Patrol and local police, saved, in just the last month, 70 children being trafficked by sex traffickers.
[02:14:46.456 --> 02:14:47.176]  And that's Barry.
[02:14:47.217 --> 02:14:49.599]  There's Fox 10 out of Phoenix.
[02:14:51.881 --> 02:14:53.443]  That's in a Texas operation.
[02:14:55.350 --> 02:14:56.671]  Where is it in the national news?
[02:14:57.231 --> 02:14:58.972]  Well, let's go back to why that's happening.
[02:14:59.452 --> 02:15:01.793]  Here's a report from six years ago out of the Washington Post.
[02:15:03.074 --> 02:15:09.417]  Obama administration placed children with human traffickers, Senate report confirms, knowingly.
[02:15:11.618 --> 02:15:12.679]  And that's what it breaks down.
[02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:15.540]  And it's only expanded.
[02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:17.321]  It's probably five times bigger under Biden.
[02:15:17.681 --> 02:15:18.682]  It stopped under Trump.
[02:15:20.094 --> 02:15:21.455]  Here's Channel 2 out of Houston.
[02:15:21.475 --> 02:15:26.498]  70 missing children recovered in West Texas, authorities say.
[02:15:26.518 --> 02:15:32.541]  70 missing children were recovered during a law enforcement operation in West Texas, authorities announced this week.
[02:15:34.326 --> 02:15:39.204]   Homeland Security investigators in El Paso, the Texas Department of Public Safety, and
[02:15:39.204 --> 02:15:43.326]   numerous other federal, state, and local agencies located and recovered the children as part
[02:15:43.326 --> 02:15:45.405]  of a three-week operation.
[02:15:45.405 --> 02:15:49.286]   Operation Lost Souls, which ran from the end of April through May, we're only learning
[02:15:49.286 --> 02:15:57.926]   now, in El Paso, Midland, and Hector, said Tom Green Counties, recovered the missing
[02:15:57.926 --> 02:16:03.725]   youth, many of them runaways, ranged from age 10 to 17, some smuggled into the U.S.
[02:16:03.725 --> 02:16:04.725]  It goes on.
[02:16:04.725 --> 02:16:09.725]   The children recovered included victims of sex trafficking and physical and sexual abuse,
[02:16:09.725 --> 02:16:13.166]   U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement said in the news release.
[02:16:13.166 --> 02:16:17.085]   The majority of the children were located in West Texas, but some were located in the
[02:16:17.085 --> 02:16:23.326]   Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, as well as state of Colorado and in Mexico.
[02:16:23.770 --> 02:16:24.731]  And it goes on from there.
[02:16:25.771 --> 02:16:27.111]  And why is that so important?
[02:16:27.411 --> 02:16:29.171]  This stuff comes out almost every day.
[02:16:30.432 --> 02:16:31.672]  And it's back of the newspaper.
[02:16:33.812 --> 02:16:38.793]  Because the Democrats, like Pelosi, say that MS-13 are God's children.
[02:16:41.474 --> 02:16:50.576]  And they are involved in the biggest human smuggling operation in history, in Europe and the US, collapsing the third world with lockdown policies.
[02:16:52.213 --> 02:16:56.519]  And then flooding us with these people that use children to get across the border because they're let go.
[02:16:56.539 --> 02:17:00.745]  They have children and then they send the children back over and do it over and over again.
[02:17:01.146 --> 02:17:07.014]  Some children as young as one year old throwing babies over the fences, over the walls.
[02:17:08.971 --> 02:17:10.512]  Where is the humanization of this?
[02:17:10.612 --> 02:17:11.593]  Where is AOC?
[02:17:11.913 --> 02:17:12.533]  Where are these people?
[02:17:12.734 --> 02:17:14.135]  And the answer is nowhere.
[02:17:14.495 --> 02:17:18.137]  One of the biggest things Trump did was almost stop this.
[02:17:18.197 --> 02:17:20.779]  Take it from massive under Obama to a trickle.
[02:17:21.199 --> 02:17:22.861]  And now under Biden, it's boom!
[02:17:24.342 --> 02:17:27.884]  Massively bigger than anything Obama did.
[02:17:27.944 --> 02:17:34.789]  This is pure, absolute, complete, and total satanic evil.
[02:17:36.445 --> 02:17:38.387]  But that's why independent media exists.
[02:17:39.087 --> 02:17:40.549]  That's why you support InfoWars.
[02:17:40.969 --> 02:17:42.170]  That's why you spread the word.
[02:17:42.530 --> 02:17:43.892]  That's why you pray for the broadcast.
[02:17:44.272 --> 02:17:51.518]  It's because we're reaching millions of people right now and the system is as mad as a beehive that got kicked.
[02:17:52.139 --> 02:17:56.403]  It's as mad as a hornet's nest that we're still on air in defiance.
[02:17:57.143 --> 02:18:14.823]  Of everything they're doing and we're going to be here as long as we can with our own infrastructure and our own systems and huge investments of things you don't even know about to make sure the transmission gets out no matter what if we got to do whatever it takes.
[02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:18.931]  Great job of the crew.
[02:18:19.071 --> 02:18:21.032]  Amazing job to everybody.
[02:18:21.432 --> 02:18:27.116]  And I'm just very blessed and humbled to be here and to be part of what's happening because we're winning spiritually.
[02:18:27.477 --> 02:18:28.598]  We're winning culturally.
[02:18:28.938 --> 02:18:30.159]  We're winning the hearts and minds.
[02:18:30.199 --> 02:18:33.401]  But the globalists know that and they are pulling the rug out from under everybody.
[02:18:33.841 --> 02:18:37.404]  They are turning over the chessboard and they are going for broke right now.
[02:18:37.944 --> 02:18:41.569]  All right, best-selling author, talk show host, Wayne Allen Root is coming up.
[02:18:41.669 --> 02:18:42.771]  I've got a little bit more to say.
[02:18:42.831 --> 02:18:43.853]  I'll hand the baton to him.
[02:18:44.193 --> 02:18:46.777]  We come back in T-minus 60 seconds.
[02:18:46.837 --> 02:18:49.200]  Wayne Allen Root is set to take over.

[02:20:26.253 --> 02:20:27.654]  They know about the gun confiscation.

[02:20:29.495 --> 02:20:34.339]  We are fighting hard, as hard as we can, to reach out to people.
[02:20:34.359 --> 02:20:39.763]  And we're asking you, the listeners, to just take these archives, take these live shows, and share the hell out of them.

[02:21:45.928 --> 02:21:53.445]  Wayne Allen Root of RootForAmerica.com, best-selling author, syndicated columnist, talk show host, you name it, takes over right now!
[02:21:56.405 --> 02:21:57.586]  All right, thank you, Alex.
[02:21:57.626 --> 02:21:59.467]  Wayne Allyn Root, RootForAmerica.com.
[02:21:59.868 --> 02:22:02.529]  And you can always email me, wayneroot at gmail.com.
[02:22:02.549 --> 02:22:03.150]  Love to hear from you.
[02:22:03.170 --> 02:22:06.052]  I get all my best information from my fans.
[02:22:06.092 --> 02:22:17.420]  I get so many great ideas for what I'm going to talk about on my national radio show, on TV shows like this one with Alex Jones, on my social media, on my nationally syndicated newspaper columns.
[02:22:18.001 --> 02:22:33.352]   Moments ago, literally in the last 30 minutes or so, We found out that Hillary Clinton lawyer Michael Sussman, the first person brought to trial by Durham, the prosecutor, John Durham, is acquitted of lying to the FBI.
[02:22:34.113 --> 02:22:37.276]  And you know, I get asked this every day, Wayne, is Durham our savior?
[02:22:37.696 --> 02:22:38.797]  Is Durham the answer?
[02:22:38.817 --> 02:22:40.718]  And I didn't know this was going to happen.
[02:22:40.758 --> 02:22:42.319]  It was pretty clear this guy was guilty.
[02:22:42.940 --> 02:22:43.621]  Pretty clear.
[02:22:43.761 --> 02:22:50.446]  Anyone could see, if you weren't blind, that Michael Sussman was guilty of a massive crime here, fraud and cover up.
[02:22:51.061 --> 02:22:52.102]  But he got found innocent!
[02:22:52.862 --> 02:22:59.928]  And I didn't know that at the time, when I'm asked this question over the last two weeks and I keep saying, No, Durham is not our savior.
[02:23:00.388 --> 02:23:01.849]  No, this is not the answer.
[02:23:02.329 --> 02:23:04.171]  Because the system is corrupt!
[02:23:04.873 --> 02:23:09.835]  The judges are corrupt, the prosecutors are corrupt, and the juries are corrupt.
[02:23:09.855 --> 02:23:12.575]  These trials go on in Washington, D.C.
[02:23:13.076 --> 02:23:18.237]  where 90, something like 97% of voters are registered Democrat.
[02:23:18.737 --> 02:23:21.938]  You can't get a fair jury in Washington, D.C.
[02:23:21.958 --> 02:23:30.361]  to ever prosecute Hillary, Obama, Biden, Kamala, John Kerry, all the criminals out there, or any of their people.
[02:23:30.821 --> 02:23:35.889]   You can't get a fair trial, a fair hearing, So, proof is in now.
[02:23:36.349 --> 02:23:36.789]  You can't.
[02:23:37.710 --> 02:23:40.271]  And then I wanted to read you something very funny here.
[02:23:42.172 --> 02:23:51.576]  FDA official in charge of evaluating new drugs for the FDA, Food and Drug Administration, is hospitalized for a mental disorder.
[02:23:52.536 --> 02:23:54.237]  I could tell you they're all insane.
[02:23:54.938 --> 02:24:09.439]   Basically, the entire Democrat Party is a mixture of radical communist nutjob, mentally ill nutjob, And people who hate America, and people who are just bizarre with bizarre lifestyles.
[02:24:09.860 --> 02:24:16.543]  You know, like Rachel Levine, one of the most important people in healthcare in the United States, is not quite sure, and I'm certainly not sure.
[02:24:16.563 --> 02:24:17.764]  Is it a man?
[02:24:17.784 --> 02:24:18.944]  Is it a woman?
[02:24:19.344 --> 02:24:21.205]  Did they keep their penis and their vagina?
[02:24:21.565 --> 02:24:22.326]  I don't really know!
[02:24:22.826 --> 02:24:24.787]  It's so confusing what Rachel Levine is.
[02:24:25.167 --> 02:24:27.949]  And she's the number two person at Health and Human Services.
[02:24:28.409 --> 02:24:29.409]  That's the left!
[02:24:29.870 --> 02:24:31.130]  They're all crazy!
[02:24:31.490 --> 02:24:32.451]  They're nut jobs!
[02:24:32.951 --> 02:24:39.094]  And mix all that in with their, uh, literally, like, mesmerized, hypnotized by the devil.
[02:24:39.735 --> 02:24:40.655]  There's Rachel Levine.
[02:24:41.255 --> 02:24:42.496]  Is that a man or is that a woman?
[02:24:42.896 --> 02:24:44.517]  To me, that's a man with a wig.
[02:24:45.017 --> 02:24:47.899]  That is an incredibly unattractive man with a wig.
[02:24:48.279 --> 02:24:50.020]  That is the ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[02:24:50.620 --> 02:24:56.103]  That's the number two person in healthcare in the United States who isn't quite sure what's going on down there.
[02:24:56.623 --> 02:24:57.824]  It's so bizarre.
[02:24:58.084 --> 02:24:59.805]  I don't know what to say.
[02:25:00.185 --> 02:25:00.866]  It's bizarre.
[02:25:00.886 --> 02:25:02.467]  I've never been in my life anti-gay.
[02:25:02.827 --> 02:25:03.467]  You want to be gay?
[02:25:03.527 --> 02:25:04.008]  I love you.
[02:25:04.048 --> 02:25:04.728]  Go be gay.
[02:25:05.088 --> 02:25:06.269]  In the privacy of your own home.
[02:25:06.589 --> 02:25:07.550]  Be as gay as you want.
[02:25:07.570 --> 02:25:08.491]  Be as lesbian as you want.
[02:25:08.811 --> 02:25:09.991]  Be as transsexual as you want.
[02:25:10.332 --> 02:25:10.932]  I don't care.
[02:25:11.392 --> 02:25:13.173]  But stop shoving it in our faces.
[02:25:13.554 --> 02:25:16.195]  Stop trying to teach kindergartners that it's okay.
[02:25:16.736 --> 02:25:17.416]  It's all weird.
[02:25:18.497 --> 02:25:22.019]  This whole new obsession with transgenderism is weird.
[02:25:22.685 --> 02:25:36.014]  But there's so many mentally ill people and so many people owned by the devil in the Democrat Party now, and the top official at the FDA in charge of evaluating new drugs is hospitalized for a mental disorder.
[02:25:36.594 --> 02:25:37.615]  Isn't that perfect?
[02:25:38.135 --> 02:25:38.996]  Par for the course.
[02:25:39.436 --> 02:25:44.480]  It backs up everything I've said about the people who have been saying the vaccine is great.
[02:25:44.880 --> 02:25:46.862]  The vaccine is fine for pregnant women.
[02:25:47.222 --> 02:25:49.324]  Well, all the pregnant women have miscarriages.
[02:25:49.644 --> 02:25:51.265]  The vaccine's fine for children.
[02:25:51.645 --> 02:26:00.292]  Well, children that are breastfed are dying and are getting diseases we never imagined possible because their mom that they're breastfeeding from is vaccinated.
[02:26:00.832 --> 02:26:08.432]   It's all lies, corruption, mental illness, and an evil, obviously an evil mass murder plot,
[02:26:08.432 --> 02:26:11.771]   but that's put together by the devil or people who worship the devil,
[02:26:11.771 --> 02:26:16.971]   because I've never seen normal humans who'd be willing to kill little babies like this.
[02:26:16.971 --> 02:26:21.952]   They've gone from abortion murder, you know, during the pregnancy in the womb,
[02:26:21.952 --> 02:26:26.092]   to abortion murder after a baby's born, at the moment of birth,
[02:26:26.092 --> 02:26:30.832]   to abortion murder a week after birth, I'm sure it'll be a month after birth,
[02:26:30.832 --> 02:26:36.371]   but they're also using the vaccines to kill babies in breastfeeding mothers.
[02:26:36.551 --> 02:26:40.534]  And to give the vaccine to babies that will kill them or maim them for life?
[02:26:40.955 --> 02:26:46.699]  Then there's the baby formula shortage that was purposely concocted by the government.
[02:26:47.039 --> 02:26:49.762]  Biden knew about it and did nothing and announced nothing.
[02:26:50.122 --> 02:26:59.990]  Now there's mile-long lines over the weekend in Michigan, and I'm sure all over the United States, but I saw the mile-long line in Michigan of parents waiting in line to get baby formula so their kids don't die.
[02:27:01.151 --> 02:27:11.017]  The Democrat Party must stay up at night late thinking of new ways to murder babies and to kill off the population and to make all of us sick!
[02:27:12.236 --> 02:27:13.377]  It'll cripple disabled.
[02:27:13.837 --> 02:27:16.780]  It's just sick and the numbers are coming out.
[02:27:17.220 --> 02:27:23.966]  This vaccine is not just death for the average person, death for the working age person who is mandated to take it.
[02:27:24.366 --> 02:27:26.328]  It's death for babies.
[02:27:26.808 --> 02:27:31.672]  The amount of miscarriages, my gosh, and the amount of children are getting sick.
[02:27:32.112 --> 02:27:33.473]  The new hepatitis outbreak!
[02:27:33.813 --> 02:27:42.919]  I'd be willing to bet you any amount of money the new hepatitis outbreak is tied to all women who are breastfeeding and they've been vaccinated and the vaccine is coming to the babies.
[02:27:43.339 --> 02:27:57.348]  I just saw proof over the weekend in the Pfizer pre-trials, which were filled with fraud by the way, and they covered up all the deaths and all the injuries, but they tried to say that pregnant women it's okay and breastfeeding moms it's okay.
[02:27:57.749 --> 02:28:01.211]  Well, they showed in the pre-trials that the babies all died!
[02:28:02.395 --> 02:28:03.657]  Miscarriage is left and right.
[02:28:03.937 --> 02:28:05.499]  I think it was 82% miscarriage.
[02:28:05.940 --> 02:28:08.103]  And then they showed one woman, one.
[02:28:08.704 --> 02:28:10.166]  I'm sure they'll say that's a freak stat.
[02:28:10.767 --> 02:28:16.014]  One woman who was vaccinated in the trial, who was breastfeeding, her breast milk came out blue.
[02:28:16.534 --> 02:28:17.315]  And the baby died.
[02:28:18.704 --> 02:28:21.066]  I wonder if there's a tie between those two things.
[02:28:21.767 --> 02:28:22.268]  You think?
[02:28:22.728 --> 02:28:23.149]  Maybe?
[02:28:23.649 --> 02:28:27.514]  You think maybe we're in a period of mass murder by the medical establishment?
[02:28:28.034 --> 02:28:29.276]  This is crazy!
[02:28:29.676 --> 02:28:35.303]  I'm the guy who wrote the column that's been out there and has gone viral all over the country about, I finally figured out COVID.
[02:28:35.703 --> 02:28:41.688]  And it's all about greed, and they've convinced all the doctors, and they've convinced all the medical professionals, and all the scientists.
[02:28:41.948 --> 02:28:45.290]  They convinced them all the vaccine was fine, based on the trials.
[02:28:45.751 --> 02:28:47.052]  The trials were all fraud.
[02:28:47.452 --> 02:28:50.314]  The trials were all covered up, and the doctors didn't know it.
[02:28:50.334 --> 02:28:54.797]  Now that they found out, the doctors don't want to say anything, because they're afraid they'll get sued.
[02:28:55.138 --> 02:28:56.739]  So everybody's covering it up.
[02:28:57.279 --> 02:29:01.127]  Wayne Allyn Root will be right back more with War on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:29:01.167 --> 02:29:02.129]  Always an honor to be with you.
[02:29:02.470 --> 02:29:03.612]  Rootforamerica.com.
[02:29:03.973 --> 02:29:04.955]  Wayne Root at gmail.com.
[02:29:05.275 --> 02:29:06.458]  See you in a sec.
[02:29:07.372 --> 02:29:08.874]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root, welcome back.
[02:29:08.894 --> 02:29:10.756]  This is what you call Instant City or Pants.
[02:29:11.257 --> 02:29:12.298]  Television in the break.
[02:29:12.358 --> 02:29:21.990]  I was letting all my fans know at my Getter page and at my MeWe page, my Gab page, and my Parlor page that I'm on New Full Wars Live right now.
[02:29:22.050 --> 02:29:26.816]  I did not let anyone know on my two Facebook pages, my personal and my fan page.
[02:29:27.436 --> 02:29:32.159]  Because they'll probably ban me the minute they hear the word InfoWars for Alex Jones.
[02:29:32.699 --> 02:29:34.280]  I mean, Twitter's banned me for life.
[02:29:34.741 --> 02:29:39.904]  Facebook is shadow banning the F out of me so that almost no one can see me on Facebook.
[02:29:40.244 --> 02:29:43.926]  But anytime I mention anything about Alex Jones, that's it.
[02:29:43.986 --> 02:29:44.207]  Boom.
[02:29:44.507 --> 02:29:45.367]  Suspended for a week.
[02:29:45.467 --> 02:29:46.908]  I mean, it's a joke.
[02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:49.270]  The amount of censorship out there, it's a joke.
[02:29:50.071 --> 02:29:52.858]  And it's sad, and it's depressing, and it's a reality.
[02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:57.390]  As a matter of fact, I'm sure I've mentioned this on the Alex Jones Show, but I want to mention it again.
[02:29:58.268 --> 02:30:10.135]  How many of you remember that a few months back it became a fact that Newsmax TV and Fox News took millions of dollars from the federal government as bribes, literally.
[02:30:10.455 --> 02:30:12.717]  I'm sure they couched them as advertising deals.
[02:30:13.137 --> 02:30:23.023]  But the government said, if we give you $5 million to advertise the vaccine, will you get rid of all anti-vaccine hosts and all anti-vaccine guests and make sure you vaccinate the whole staff?
[02:30:24.472 --> 02:30:28.897]  This has really gone on in America at Fox News and at Newsmax TV.
[02:30:29.377 --> 02:30:36.864]  So there's nobody left but people like Wayne Root and Alex Jones and a rare few others to tell you the truth.
[02:30:37.425 --> 02:30:38.186]  It's incredible.
[02:30:38.946 --> 02:30:52.648]   And by the way, soon there literally will be no one left because you can guess that most of the hosts of Fox News and Newsmax will be dead or maimed for you know, for the rest of their lives, very soon, very soon
[02:30:52.648 --> 02:30:56.299]   could mean tomorrow, it could mean a month from now, it could mean a year from now. We don't
[02:30:56.299 --> 02:31:03.170]   know and I don't know, because there were no vaccine trials. They ended all semblance of a real trial.
[02:31:03.170 --> 02:31:05.509]  There was no control group.
[02:31:05.509 --> 02:31:10.869]   We have no idea whether everybody dies, some people die, some people never die,
[02:31:10.869 --> 02:31:16.229]   or eventually everybody's crippled, maimed, disabled, or die from these vaccines.
[02:31:16.382 --> 02:31:20.444]  But we know there's a mass die-off very quickly after you get vaccinated.
[02:31:20.844 --> 02:31:25.586]  We know there's a mass die-off a day later, two days later, a week later, two weeks later.
[02:31:26.026 --> 02:31:30.088]  And then some people die slowly but surely over time, but it's only been a year now.
[02:31:31.288 --> 02:31:37.971]  And so we don't even know when the mass die-off, the mass, mass die-offs could happen, but the numbers are staggering.
[02:31:38.885 --> 02:31:51.699]  Today we found out numbers released by Alabama, the state of Alabama, show that people under the age of 65 are dying right now much faster at a higher rate than people over the age of 65.
[02:31:52.861 --> 02:31:55.724]  When has this ever happened in the history of America?
[02:31:55.764 --> 02:31:59.308]  And wait a minute, hold on, I gotta show you the seventh card.
[02:31:59.932 --> 02:32:05.635]  And it's only happened since 2021 when the COVID vaccine came into effect.
[02:32:05.715 --> 02:32:06.435]  It was mandated.
[02:32:06.856 --> 02:32:13.859]  The year 2021 on, people under the age of 65 have died in higher numbers than people over the age of 65.
[02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:20.143]  When in history have young people died in higher numbers faster than old people?
[02:32:20.203 --> 02:32:20.463]  When?
[02:32:20.623 --> 02:32:20.923]  Never!
[02:32:21.583 --> 02:32:22.764]  Except with this vaccine.
[02:32:24.145 --> 02:32:24.605]  Incredible.
[02:32:25.026 --> 02:32:25.826]  So I want to finish up.
[02:32:25.986 --> 02:32:30.449]  FDA official in charge of evaluating new drugs hospitalized for mental disorder.
[02:32:30.489 --> 02:32:31.690]  I started this in the last segment.
[02:32:32.190 --> 02:32:44.798]  Dr. Jeffrey Siegel, I had to give you his name, Director of the FDA's Office of Drug Evaluation Sciences, was transported from his home to a hospital for mental disorder at 3 a.m.
[02:32:44.998 --> 02:32:52.163]  on May 9th, according to Montgomery County, Maryland, police dispatch logs reviewed by the Daily Wire.
[02:32:53.436 --> 02:32:55.098]  So this is not me making up.
[02:32:55.398 --> 02:32:56.399]  This is not hearsay.
[02:32:56.419 --> 02:32:57.320]  This is not rumor.
[02:32:57.340 --> 02:33:01.223]  This is from police logs from Montgomery County, Maryland.
[02:33:01.844 --> 02:33:02.885]  The guy is nuts.
[02:33:03.605 --> 02:33:04.947]  But let's say I'm an opinion host.
[02:33:05.427 --> 02:33:07.249]  This is an opinion show and it's my opinion.
[02:33:07.669 --> 02:33:09.170]  The guy is freaking loony.
[02:33:09.631 --> 02:33:09.931]  Nuts.
[02:33:11.673 --> 02:33:13.995]  And he's in charge of evaluating new drugs for the FDA.
[02:33:14.702 --> 02:33:17.303]  I'm sure he was the head guy to evaluate vaccines for the FDA.
[02:33:17.983 --> 02:33:19.324]  Oh, this vaccine is perfect!
[02:33:19.684 --> 02:33:22.025]  Excuse me while I go back to my medical institution.
[02:33:22.525 --> 02:33:25.006]  This is what you're dealing with!
[02:33:25.646 --> 02:33:29.308]  I know this is all funny, it's like a Saturday Night Live routine, but it's the truth!
[02:33:30.034 --> 02:33:30.814]  They're nuts!
[02:33:31.915 --> 02:33:33.736]  And they're obviously suicidal.
[02:33:33.936 --> 02:33:37.717]  Or, maybe they're not so nuts, and they're not so suicidal.
[02:33:37.737 --> 02:33:38.538]  I mean, this guy is.
[02:33:39.158 --> 02:33:48.702]  Dr. Jeffrey Siegel may be nuts and suicidal, but obviously the ones who run the COVID vaccine manufacturing companies at Big Pharma may not be that nuts.
[02:33:49.183 --> 02:33:52.964]  Because this was the big story this weekend that I had to bring up right now.
[02:33:54.285 --> 02:33:58.907]  Big Pharma boss caught faking his COVID vaccine.
[02:33:59.620 --> 02:34:03.442]  Injected himself with salt water, now facing criminal charges.
[02:34:04.283 --> 02:34:20.711]  So, according to police, they've charged Jose Maria Fernandez Sousa Farah, the president of European pharmaceutical giant PharmaMar, with being falsely vaccinated against COVID-19.
[02:34:21.432 --> 02:34:28.936]  He paid somebody in a position to give him a fake vaccine so he'd have a vaccine card so he could tell everyone he's vaccinated.
[02:34:30.305 --> 02:34:45.454]  And it turns out he's one of 2,200 celebrities, athletes and European big shots who were not vaccinated but claimed they were and got fake vaccine cards, according to a list compiled by the National Police.
[02:34:46.194 --> 02:34:47.335]  This is in Spain.
[02:34:48.835 --> 02:34:52.137]  And he's president of a company that makes the vaccine.
[02:34:53.098 --> 02:34:54.959]  So why didn't he want the vaccine?
[02:34:55.819 --> 02:35:03.185]  There's got to be a reason that the president of a big pharma company, a billion dollar giant, doesn't want the vaccine.
[02:35:03.725 --> 02:35:04.766]  Something's up here, right?
[02:35:04.866 --> 02:35:05.346]  Duh.
[02:35:05.867 --> 02:35:07.048]  It's not too hard to figure out.
[02:35:07.708 --> 02:35:16.415]  I've been telling you for a year and a half now, 18 months, vaccine was available in December 2020 and then in mass in the first quarter of 2021.
[02:35:16.795 --> 02:35:21.553]   And I've been telling you from the moment it came out, Don't take it, don't take it, don't take it.
[02:35:21.573 --> 02:35:24.856]  But unlike government, you can't sue me for saying don't take it.
[02:35:24.876 --> 02:35:26.698]  I'm not forcing you at gunpoint.
[02:35:27.078 --> 02:35:30.701]  I'm giving you my opinions and you can take them or leave them.
[02:35:31.142 --> 02:35:40.930]  Government, on the other hand, puts their boot on your neck like a bunch of Nazis or Gestapo or KGB or East German Stasi and they lie to you.
[02:35:41.010 --> 02:35:42.091]  They commit fraud.
[02:35:42.852 --> 02:35:45.394]  They withhold information you need to know.
[02:35:46.553 --> 02:35:49.498]  They cover up real deaths and real injuries?
[02:35:49.998 --> 02:35:54.866]  They intimidate doctors so doctors cannot tell you anything's wrong and they'll lose their license?
[02:35:55.346 --> 02:35:57.590]  You know, here's something I'm gonna inform you about most people don't know.
[02:35:58.385 --> 02:36:01.006]  Doctors are human beings just like you and me.
[02:36:01.567 --> 02:36:04.548]  And just like you and me, they need their income.
[02:36:04.588 --> 02:36:05.709]  Most doctors are broke.
[02:36:05.749 --> 02:36:06.309]  Did you know that?
[02:36:06.810 --> 02:36:11.092]  Almost every doctor makes like now, used to be like a million dollars a year, half a million a year.
[02:36:11.592 --> 02:36:13.573]  Now because of Obamacare, they've been cut in half.
[02:36:13.974 --> 02:36:17.275]  So doctors now make about $150 to $250 a year.
[02:36:17.315 --> 02:36:20.397]  Do you know what a PA makes, a physician's assistant?
[02:36:20.417 --> 02:36:22.798]  $150 a year for not going to medical school.
[02:36:23.199 --> 02:36:27.081]  Most doctors barely or don't at all make as much money as a PA.
[02:36:27.682 --> 02:36:36.925]  But even if they make more and they make $250,000 or $500,000, they live on that money each year, spend it, and then with kids in college, next year they've got to make it again!
[02:36:37.549 --> 02:36:47.658]  You take a doctor living in a nice house or even a mansion with a fancy car or two in the driveway and two kids in college, he needs his $250,000 income to keep doing that.
[02:36:48.019 --> 02:36:51.902]  So if he loses his license, his family's ruined, his kids have to drop out of college.
[02:36:52.243 --> 02:36:59.970]  Instead of driving a Mercedes or a Porsche, he'll be driving a Yugo pretty soon and he'll be collecting unemployment insurance and he won't be able to eat.
[02:37:00.709 --> 02:37:03.893]  So of course doctors are scared of losing their medical license.
[02:37:04.434 --> 02:37:09.540]  If you say anything about the vaccine killing people, you'll be up on charges and lose your license.
[02:37:10.020 --> 02:37:18.651]  If you say anything or dare to prescribe ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine or mention vitamins, you'll be up on charges and lose your license.
[02:37:19.311 --> 02:37:22.734]  All of those are the only things that work against COVID.
[02:37:23.095 --> 02:37:32.423]  All the experts tell me, all the holistic experts, vitamins work, vitamin D works dramatically, vitamin C works, zinc works, quercetin works, ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine work.
[02:37:32.784 --> 02:37:34.886]  If you mention them, you lose your medical license.
[02:37:35.506 --> 02:37:36.947]  Incredible times we live in.
[02:37:36.967 --> 02:37:38.549]  All right, we're headed to a break.
[02:37:39.341 --> 02:37:41.082]  Rootforamerica.com is my website.
[02:37:41.403 --> 02:37:43.484]  Waynerootatgmail.com is my email.
[02:37:44.024 --> 02:37:46.506]  And my book, The Great Patriot Protest, a boycott book.
[02:37:46.786 --> 02:37:47.407]  We'll be right back.
[02:37:47.447 --> 02:37:48.788]  Wayne Eller Root, Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:53.002]  There's my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:37:53.062 --> 02:37:55.883]  It's not just a book, it's a resource guide.
[02:37:56.223 --> 02:38:01.786]  It's got all the information on the 116 most woke liberal companies in America that you need to boycott.
[02:38:02.166 --> 02:38:06.588]  Stop buying their products and contact them and let them know why you're not buying their products anymore.
[02:38:06.828 --> 02:38:10.810]  Because they're liberal, they're woke, they're stupid, they're ignorant, and they're destroying America.
[02:38:11.131 --> 02:38:12.291]  And you need to put them out of business.
[02:38:12.611 --> 02:38:13.972]  But you need to tell them why.
[02:38:14.392 --> 02:38:16.253]  In other words, you can't just stop buying Disney.
[02:38:16.533 --> 02:38:16.993]  That's good.
[02:38:17.013 --> 02:38:22.234]  I mean, I can't wait for the next quarterly report by Disney that shows their business is down by 25 percent.
[02:38:22.534 --> 02:38:23.155]  That'll be great.
[02:38:23.995 --> 02:38:25.295]  15 percent, 40 percent.
[02:38:25.335 --> 02:38:25.675]  I don't know.
[02:38:26.015 --> 02:38:27.536]  It'll range, but it'll be good.
[02:38:27.556 --> 02:38:28.196]  It'll be down.
[02:38:28.616 --> 02:38:31.517]  But you need to send them a note to let them know why.
[02:38:31.957 --> 02:38:33.177]  You're not buying for them anymore.
[02:38:33.477 --> 02:38:36.358]  And that will make sure the CEO gets in the back of his mind.
[02:38:36.758 --> 02:38:44.140]  And I give you the CEO's name, the board of directors name, all the information you need to contact them, phone number, email, social media, etc.
[02:38:44.441 --> 02:38:46.101]  Great Patriot Protest, the boycott book.
[02:38:46.441 --> 02:38:46.641]  All right.
[02:38:46.981 --> 02:38:50.762]  So I wrote a column that was my nationally syndicated newspaper column.
[02:38:50.782 --> 02:38:53.483]  You find things like this on my website, Root for America.
[02:38:53.923 --> 02:38:54.763]  And I want to read it to you.
[02:38:54.803 --> 02:38:58.244]  It came out this weekend as syndicated around the country by Creator Syndicate.
[02:38:58.685 --> 02:39:04.969]   The 14 lessons Every conservative patriot learned from the tragic Texas school shooting.
[02:39:05.669 --> 02:39:11.073]  Hint, Democrats will be shocked and horrified by the things we believe in.
[02:39:12.895 --> 02:39:15.497]  Everyone has heard about the terrible tragic Texas school shooting.
[02:39:15.997 --> 02:39:20.781]  As usual, Democrats see this as an opportunity to blame guns and Republicans.
[02:39:21.494 --> 02:39:25.495]  They will demand gun ban, strict gun control, and gun confiscation.
[02:39:26.016 --> 02:39:26.776]  So what else is new?
[02:39:27.116 --> 02:39:29.977]  And I didn't add this to the article, but I could add it right now on TV.
[02:39:30.477 --> 02:39:40.821]  Thank goodness he wasn't white, because if the killer was white instead of Hispanic, this would be an anti-white rage by Democrats, in addition to guns and Republicans.
[02:39:41.941 --> 02:39:45.603]  Like, Democrats pray all day and night that every killer will be white.
[02:39:46.083 --> 02:39:47.464]  Every mass shooter will be white.
[02:39:47.904 --> 02:39:54.667]  Never mentioning that in every big city in America, almost every murder is of an innocent black person by a black criminal.
[02:39:55.007 --> 02:39:58.048]  Never mentioning that, you know, 19 dead kids is horrible!
[02:39:58.548 --> 02:39:59.069]  Horrible!
[02:39:59.169 --> 02:40:00.509]  It's unthinkable!
[02:40:00.929 --> 02:40:02.610]  There's no one that could condone it.
[02:40:02.650 --> 02:40:04.711]  There's no one that could say it's not a big deal.
[02:40:04.731 --> 02:40:06.912]  There's no one that could say, ah, we'll move past it.
[02:40:08.072 --> 02:40:08.813]  19 dead kids!
[02:40:09.253 --> 02:40:11.794]  So let me say, that's horrendous!
[02:40:13.495 --> 02:40:15.216]  It's mind-blowing how horrible it is.
[02:40:15.836 --> 02:40:21.619]  But, every single weekend in Chicago, 75 people get shot and 19 of them are dead!
[02:40:21.959 --> 02:40:22.680]  And they're all black!
[02:40:23.140 --> 02:40:24.541]  Is that maybe an issue?
[02:40:24.921 --> 02:40:26.081]  Is that not mass murder?
[02:40:26.422 --> 02:40:33.085]  It's just by 75 separate shooters, and the 19 dead are 19 separate shooters, instead of one mass shooting by one shooter.
[02:40:33.715 --> 02:40:42.662]  So this goes on every weekend in every big city in America, and there's no Black Lives Matter protest, no liberal protest, no President Biden says nothing about it.
[02:40:43.442 --> 02:40:44.943]  No Democrat says anything about it.
[02:40:45.283 --> 02:40:47.285]  The Democrats in the district say nothing about it.
[02:40:47.605 --> 02:40:48.846]  No one does anything about it.
[02:40:49.506 --> 02:40:53.990]  It's far worse when you add it up in every city across 365 days each year.
[02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:59.334]  Far worse than the few, thank God, mass murders in America.
[02:40:59.354 --> 02:40:59.754]  What are they like?
[02:41:00.274 --> 02:41:03.478]  Fifteen a year that make the news that really are mass murders.
[02:41:03.818 --> 02:41:07.442]  They consider liberals anything like two or more is a mass murder.
[02:41:07.742 --> 02:41:09.084]  But I'm saying what makes the news?
[02:41:09.164 --> 02:41:09.944]  Ten people shot.
[02:41:10.265 --> 02:41:10.986]  Fifteen shot.
[02:41:11.426 --> 02:41:11.967]  Ten dead.
[02:41:12.047 --> 02:41:12.587]  Twenty dead.
[02:41:13.188 --> 02:41:14.609]  There's a few of those each year.
[02:41:15.050 --> 02:41:15.650]  Horrible!
[02:41:16.171 --> 02:41:16.712]  Horrible!
[02:41:17.432 --> 02:41:19.434]  But it's not about guns, it's about mental illness.
[02:41:19.475 --> 02:41:20.716]  But anyway, I segue.
[02:41:22.822 --> 02:41:33.705]  The tragic shooting is just more proof that we live in a country that's bitterly divided, so divided that the two sides, right and left, Republican and Democrat, conservative and liberal, can't agree on anything.
[02:41:34.245 --> 02:41:38.747]  We appear headed for a divorce because it's clear neither side can live with the other.
[02:41:39.267 --> 02:41:42.928]  There's no way to compromise when two sides see things so differently.
[02:41:42.948 --> 02:41:44.048]  You know, the earth is flat.
[02:41:44.449 --> 02:41:45.489]  No, the earth is round.
[02:41:46.169 --> 02:41:47.429]  It's like night and day.
[02:41:47.890 --> 02:41:53.612]   It's almost as if Republicans are from Mars and Democrats are from Uranus.
[02:41:55.434 --> 02:42:00.317]  Here are the 14 lessons I've learned from the tragedy at the Texas school last week.
[02:42:00.357 --> 02:42:06.141]  I'm certain tens of millions of conservatives and Trump voters and patriots see it the exact same way.
[02:42:06.161 --> 02:42:06.581]  Want to bet?
[02:42:07.401 --> 02:42:09.943]  Number one, guns aren't the problem.
[02:42:10.003 --> 02:42:11.564]  Gun-free zones are the problem.
[02:42:11.944 --> 02:42:13.145]  They are killing fields.
[02:42:13.505 --> 02:42:20.210]  They are open invitations for mentally deranged criminals and criminally insane madmen to walk in and start shooting.
[02:42:20.979 --> 02:42:26.681]  Gun-free signs outside a school or a church are like a blinking neon sign in Vegas.
[02:42:27.221 --> 02:42:30.463]  Blinking and screaming, come on in and kill us!
[02:42:30.823 --> 02:42:31.703]  We're defenseless!
[02:42:32.123 --> 02:42:33.084]  We can't shoot back!
[02:42:34.684 --> 02:42:38.606]  Number two, guns didn't cause this tragedy, but a good guy with a gun sure ended it.
[02:42:39.329 --> 02:42:47.977]  An armed border agent killed the bad guy, thereby saving lives, and that should be the headline.
[02:42:49.119 --> 02:42:50.680]  Every school needs armed security.
[02:42:51.101 --> 02:42:55.705]  There should be only a single point of entry to every school, and a guard must always protect that entrance.
[02:42:56.205 --> 02:42:59.669]  All other doors to the school should be locked and secured.
[02:43:01.678 --> 02:43:09.683]  Backing up armed security at every school should be teachers and or administrators who are armed with guns and professional gun training.
[02:43:10.083 --> 02:43:11.864]  Number five, how can we afford all this?
[02:43:12.264 --> 02:43:18.608]  I've argued from day one it was a disastrous decision and a tragic mistake to give another 40 billion to Ukraine.
[02:43:18.628 --> 02:43:39.809]   Matter of fact, I argued that the first 20 billion or so that we gave in one trunch was a tragic mistake and that the first 40 billion in total We gave to them in pieces including that 20 billion trunch mistake and then the next 40 billion tragic mistake We need to worry about America first we could have used that 40 billion here at home half of it 20 billion and
[02:43:40.416 --> 02:43:43.501]  Should have been used to pay for armed security at every school in America.
[02:43:44.122 --> 02:43:47.346]  And if we really want to protect children, secure the border.
[02:43:47.707 --> 02:43:50.911]  The other half of that $40 billion, i.e.
[02:43:50.931 --> 02:43:55.238]  $20 billion, should have been used to build and secure the wall at our southern border.
[02:43:56.016 --> 02:44:11.549]  If you're angry and shocked as a nation about 19 innocent young children dying in that school shooting, shouldn't we be even more concerned with tens of thousands of American kids dying each year from drug overdoses with drugs brought across that border?
[02:44:13.171 --> 02:44:16.654]  Everything that comes over that border is a threat to America's children.
[02:44:17.228 --> 02:44:26.935]  Drugs, human traffickers, child sex traffickers, pedophiles, and tons of vicious, violent criminals, gangbangers, and MS-13 murderers.
[02:44:27.516 --> 02:44:33.462]   Why didn't we use that Ukraine money To save thousands of kids' lives by securing the border.
[02:44:34.002 --> 02:44:39.124]  Gun control is a massive failure everywhere it's ever been tried.
[02:44:39.524 --> 02:44:46.366]  There are far more shootings, violent crimes and murders in Democrat-run cities with strict gun control than anywhere else.
[02:44:46.906 --> 02:44:47.607]  Why is that?
[02:44:47.647 --> 02:44:48.547]  The answer is simple.
[02:44:48.587 --> 02:44:51.028]  Strict gun control never stops criminals.
[02:44:51.068 --> 02:44:52.328]  They buy their guns illegally.
[02:44:52.768 --> 02:44:54.609]  It just leaves the good people defenseless.
[02:44:55.049 --> 02:45:05.535]   We'll do nothing to stop Crime or mass murders, what we need to do is enforce the laws already on the books, but it is Democrat district.
[02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:11.724]  That allow all the criminals back on the street, and almost every crime is committed by a repeat offender.
[02:45:12.124 --> 02:45:27.316]  Number nine, instead of useless new laws, why don't we make mass murder, the killing of two or more, a death penalty crime, and if convicted of mass murder, there are no appeals, and you get shot by firing squad the next morning after you're found guilty by a jury of your peers.
[02:45:27.376 --> 02:45:30.198]  Number ten, investigate Big Pharma!
[02:45:30.618 --> 02:45:32.820]  Not the gun companies, Big Pharma!
[02:45:33.340 --> 02:45:44.328]  For the drugs they pump into young males for depression, anger issues, attention deficit disorder, and mental illness, virtually every mass killer in recent memory was on these drugs.
[02:45:44.828 --> 02:45:48.410]  The side effects of these drugs are suicidal thoughts and violent thoughts.
[02:45:48.811 --> 02:45:51.352]  Why are we drugging all of our male teenagers in school?
[02:45:51.873 --> 02:45:54.455]  Number 11, never mentioned to fund police to me again.
[02:45:54.475 --> 02:45:58.978]  Incidents like this prove we need more police and more funding for police, not less.
[02:45:59.478 --> 02:46:04.861]   Number 12, as much as I love and appreciate the police, Boy, did they fail miserably this time.
[02:46:05.321 --> 02:46:08.783]  There are many questions about how the police responded to this school shooting.
[02:46:09.183 --> 02:46:17.988]  How could they stand around for an hour or 90 minutes knowing that kids were being shot, knowing that gunfire was going off, knowing that kids were bleeding to death and doing nothing?
[02:46:18.648 --> 02:46:23.691]  Did they actually run into the school, by the way, and get their own kids out while leaving everybody else's kids to die?
[02:46:24.031 --> 02:46:24.931]  Did cops do that?
[02:46:25.732 --> 02:46:28.833]  And were they afraid of walking into the school and getting shot?
[02:46:29.153 --> 02:46:30.194]  That's what a police chief said.
[02:46:30.494 --> 02:46:32.135]  Hey, we were afraid of getting shot.
[02:46:33.008 --> 02:46:35.829]  If you're afraid of getting shot, you need to find another profession.
[02:46:36.209 --> 02:46:41.611]  Every cop afraid of getting shot should either be indicted right now or certainly fired from their job.
[02:46:42.191 --> 02:46:43.051]  That's their job.
[02:46:43.531 --> 02:46:48.653]  So please, no more defend police, but let's also rethink how we're hiring and training cops.
[02:46:48.713 --> 02:46:51.553]  We need heroic, macho warriors as cops.
[02:46:52.034 --> 02:46:58.286]   Stop trying to make them into poets, politically correct pansies, And social workers.
[02:46:58.746 --> 02:47:00.787]  I've got a 13 and 14 to finish up.
[02:47:01.047 --> 02:47:02.308]  We're running out of time in this segment.
[02:47:02.328 --> 02:47:05.430]  I'll do it to start the next segment.
[02:47:05.450 --> 02:47:07.671]  13 and 14 lessons that you'll want to hear.
[02:47:07.731 --> 02:47:13.695]  The final crescendo from the lessons we learn from the school shooting in Texas by Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:47:13.955 --> 02:47:14.636]  We'll be right back.

[02:47:50.513 --> 02:47:57.019]  Great Patriot protest and boycott book by Wayne Allred and my co-author by the way, great guy, Nikki Ballou of Canada.
[02:47:57.719 --> 02:47:59.060]  Wow, has Canada gone bad?
[02:47:59.620 --> 02:48:00.900]  Boy, has Canada gone sour.
[02:48:01.281 --> 02:48:02.701]  Getting ready to ban all guns.
[02:48:02.721 --> 02:48:06.743]  Except the people are completely helpless when the Gestapo, i.e.
[02:48:06.823 --> 02:48:11.345]  Justin Trudeau and his storm troops try and take you away for not taking a vaccine.
[02:48:11.825 --> 02:48:13.066]  No guns to defend yourself.
[02:48:13.106 --> 02:48:13.466]  Scary.
[02:48:13.926 --> 02:48:15.847]  Great Patriot protest and boycott book.
[02:48:15.887 --> 02:48:20.629]  I was just reading you my column that came out this weekend, syndicated in newspapers around the country.
[02:48:21.010 --> 02:48:25.952]  The 14 lessons every conservative patriot learned from the tragic Texas school shooting.
[02:48:27.779 --> 02:48:31.661]  And number 12 was that the police did a poor-ass job.
[02:48:32.641 --> 02:48:34.742]  They sucked, to put it in street language.
[02:48:35.203 --> 02:48:36.163]  They were horrible.
[02:48:36.563 --> 02:48:37.804]  And they may get indicted now.
[02:48:38.644 --> 02:48:41.466]  And I feel bad for them, because the average cop is just listening to orders.
[02:48:41.886 --> 02:48:44.367]  But the people in charge who gave the orders should all be indicted.
[02:48:44.967 --> 02:48:50.970]  If you leave children alone in a school while guns are going off to be shot, you're a horrible human being.
[02:48:51.310 --> 02:48:52.991]  You don't deserve to be in charge of anything.
[02:48:53.431 --> 02:48:54.732]  You shouldn't be a dog catcher.
[02:48:55.132 --> 02:48:56.973]  You shouldn't be a public administrator.
[02:48:57.586 --> 02:48:58.567]  Let alone a police chief.
[02:48:59.648 --> 02:49:01.049]  And we got to take you away from your job.
[02:49:01.089 --> 02:49:01.389]  That's it.
[02:49:01.430 --> 02:49:01.790]  You're done.
[02:49:02.350 --> 02:49:02.751]  You're done.
[02:49:03.671 --> 02:49:06.774]  If you don't save children's lives, you have no right to call yourself a cop.
[02:49:08.055 --> 02:49:09.497]  All right.
[02:49:10.217 --> 02:49:10.598]  Number 13.
[02:49:10.638 --> 02:49:11.198]  14 key lessons.
[02:49:11.238 --> 02:49:11.458]  Number 13.
[02:49:12.603 --> 02:49:26.795]  This mass shooting and the poor police response only, this is what Democrats don't understand, only makes American conservatives and patriots even more certain it's up to us to defend ourselves and save our children and our families.
[02:49:27.415 --> 02:49:30.138]  We love the police, but we can never count on them.
[02:49:30.718 --> 02:49:32.520]  If it is to be, it is up to me.
[02:49:32.880 --> 02:49:34.022]  I learned that saying in high school.
[02:49:34.362 --> 02:49:36.224]  If it is to be, it's up to me.
[02:49:36.604 --> 02:49:37.485]  You know what taught me that saying?
[02:49:37.865 --> 02:49:47.715]  When I was a kid in high school, we had a congressman, Joe D'Aguardio, I believe was his name, or Joe D'Aguardi, in Westchester County, New York, representing the Maranac area.
[02:49:48.216 --> 02:49:49.557]  He taught me that saying.
[02:49:50.118 --> 02:49:51.639]  If it is to be, it's up to me.
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:53.341]  You got to do it yourself.
[02:49:54.622 --> 02:50:03.447]  So, I'll bet more guns and more ammunition is bought in the coming months by Americans than ever before in the history of America.
[02:50:03.827 --> 02:50:05.848]  Liberals think, oh my God, this ends guns!
[02:50:06.168 --> 02:50:07.349]  Nobody wants guns anymore!
[02:50:07.669 --> 02:50:08.810]  No, everybody wants guns.
[02:50:09.190 --> 02:50:13.232]  Because we all realize that they're going to try and ban them and we've got to protect ourselves right now.
[02:50:13.912 --> 02:50:15.713]  Number 14, and the police can't help us.
[02:50:16.073 --> 02:50:16.934]  Number 14.
[02:50:18.054 --> 02:50:18.795]  One final point.
[02:50:19.495 --> 02:50:20.516]  Actually, it's a pledge.
[02:50:21.136 --> 02:50:22.737]  Stop trying to take our guns.
[02:50:23.504 --> 02:50:27.430]  This isn't Australia, this isn't Austria, this isn't New Zealand.
[02:50:28.031 --> 02:50:30.996]  This is America, and you're never taking our guns.
[02:50:31.497 --> 02:50:35.303]  As in never, never, never, ever, ever.
[02:50:36.010 --> 02:50:41.911]  You'll only take our guns from our cold, dead hands, as Charlton Heston once said.
[02:50:42.551 --> 02:50:46.232]  So stop wasting your time, stop your demands.
[02:50:46.652 --> 02:50:49.553]  You may not know it yet, but you've already lost this battle.
[02:50:49.973 --> 02:50:51.753]  We're never giving up our guns.
[02:50:52.413 --> 02:50:54.894]  I repeat, never giving up our guns.
[02:50:55.374 --> 02:51:02.015]  Because as Thomas Jefferson and the Founding Fathers, the wisest men that ever lived, oh I know, they were right!
[02:51:03.402 --> 02:51:04.103]  That's a knock!
[02:51:04.603 --> 02:51:06.045]  You can't be white and wise!
[02:51:06.565 --> 02:51:25.443]  And I know, it was 1776, it was a long time ago, wisest group of men in the history of the world who created the greatest Constitution, the greatest Bill of Rights, and the greatest country, and the greatest capitalist system in the history of civilization of any country ever existing and ever blessed by God.
[02:51:27.367 --> 02:51:38.939]  And Thomas Jefferson and all his founding fathers all believed you need a gun to protect yourself from bad guys, but mostly you need a gun to protect yourself from the government, your own government.
[02:51:39.159 --> 02:51:43.443]  And that's true now more than it's ever been true, more than it's ever been true.
[02:51:44.264 --> 02:51:51.111]  So these are the 14 common sense lessons millions of conservative patriots learned from this tragic mass shooting.
[02:51:51.858 --> 02:51:55.163]  I know Democrats will be shocked and horrified by what we believe in.
[02:51:55.183 --> 02:51:57.726]  That's why it may be time for a divorce.
[02:51:58.487 --> 02:52:00.270]  This marriage is not working.
[02:52:01.031 --> 02:52:02.032]  We'll keep America.
[02:52:02.593 --> 02:52:06.759]  It's time for all of you that want to ban guns to go back to Uranus.
[02:52:07.691 --> 02:52:10.432]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root, being a little funny and a little wise-ass there.
[02:52:11.353 --> 02:52:13.194]  We're from Mars and you're from Uranus.
[02:52:13.714 --> 02:52:14.574]  No question about it.
[02:52:14.914 --> 02:52:16.235]  Listen, we're not giving up our guns.
[02:52:16.275 --> 02:52:17.015]  It's not going to happen.
[02:52:17.496 --> 02:52:18.516]  So stop talking about it.
[02:52:18.556 --> 02:52:19.316]  Stop thinking about it.
[02:52:19.697 --> 02:52:21.117]  Here's the kind of crazy people.
[02:52:21.157 --> 02:52:28.801]  I opened the show by telling you about the head of the FDA's approval process for new drugs at three in the morning, taken by police.
[02:52:29.301 --> 02:52:33.223]  To a mental institution, which is so par for the course and so perfect.
[02:52:33.723 --> 02:52:34.763]  Now, I got to read you this one.
[02:52:35.183 --> 02:52:39.725]  A Boston University professor says that owning property is racist.
[02:52:40.926 --> 02:52:53.471]  A Boston University professor deemed property racist while defending riots where the BLM rioters destroyed property, burned it, looted it, ripped it off.
[02:52:54.671 --> 02:52:55.432]  All that's fine.
[02:52:56.372 --> 02:53:06.045]   In the aftermath of George Floyd's death, They were looting themselves from slavery, according to this professor at Boston University.
[02:53:06.305 --> 02:53:07.605]  It's not that they were stealing.
[02:53:07.625 --> 02:53:09.346]  It's not that they were doing bad things.
[02:53:09.686 --> 02:53:17.529]  It's not that they're absolutely criminals and thugs and pieces of garbage, never taught right from wrong by mommy and daddy.
[02:53:17.929 --> 02:53:21.711]  And don't think anything I'm saying is racist, because plenty of Black Lives Matter people are white.
[02:53:22.291 --> 02:53:31.636]  Matter of fact, I would argue the majority of Black Lives Matter is white, bleeding heart liberals who are suffering from white guilt their whole life.
[02:53:31.676 --> 02:53:34.918]  They're just guilty and they hate themselves for being white.
[02:53:35.318 --> 02:53:42.942]  That's about half of Black Lives Matter and the other half are black radical revolutionaries who want to, you know, overthrow this country or loot the country to death.
[02:53:43.402 --> 02:53:44.143]  That's great, right?
[02:53:45.604 --> 02:53:46.684]  Her name is Grundy.
[02:53:47.144 --> 02:53:48.105]  See if I could find her name.
[02:53:49.233 --> 02:53:52.815]  Professor Saida Grundy from Boston University.
[02:53:53.516 --> 02:53:59.380]  She urged people not to judge communities' reactions and listen to them to address their needs.
[02:54:00.741 --> 02:54:06.084]  We hear President Biden say, I understand your frustrations, but don't destroy property, Grundy says.
[02:54:06.504 --> 02:54:18.592]  Well, when you say to black people who have historically been property, one of our greatest weapons against injustice was the looting of property from the system of slavery.
[02:54:21.448 --> 02:54:22.929]  The system of slavery!
[02:54:23.349 --> 02:54:26.472]  You know, no one on TV is more perfect to respond to this than I am.
[02:54:26.972 --> 02:54:28.493]  Because I'm Jewish!
[02:54:28.513 --> 02:54:30.114]  100% Jewish!
[02:54:30.475 --> 02:54:36.759]  Two Jewish parents, four Jewish grandparents, and when I spit in the cup and sent it away for DNA analysis, guess what?
[02:54:36.799 --> 02:54:37.280]  It came back!
[02:54:39.321 --> 02:54:42.222]  99.9% Eastern European Jew.
[02:54:42.762 --> 02:54:52.807]  I'm as Jewish as you get, other than the fact that I was raised in a 100% Italian Mafia neighborhood, and I believe I'm actually Italian by nurture versus Jewish by nature.
[02:54:53.327 --> 02:54:54.427]  So yes, born 100% Jewish.
[02:54:56.528 --> 02:54:57.949]  And what is Jewish history?
[02:54:58.509 --> 02:55:00.591]  Nothing but slavery!
[02:55:01.071 --> 02:55:07.955]  Not like black people's slavery for one period in America, but Jews have been slaves throughout history all over the world.
[02:55:08.496 --> 02:55:11.718]  Egypt, Roman Empire, you name it, we were slaves.
[02:55:11.978 --> 02:55:13.839]  We were basically slaves of the old Soviet Union.
[02:55:14.944 --> 02:55:16.806]  Until we ran away to Israel, right?
[02:55:17.167 --> 02:55:22.513]  Nazi Germany and Egypt and Roman Empire all treated Jews like garbage.
[02:55:22.874 --> 02:55:26.879]  And then the Holocaust, far closer to today than slavery.
[02:55:27.512 --> 02:55:29.753]  And I don't sit around talking about it all day.
[02:55:29.773 --> 02:55:31.694]  I don't sit around thinking about it all day.
[02:55:32.014 --> 02:55:36.236]  As a matter of fact, from the day I was born, my parents taught me, in America, you're going to do great.
[02:55:36.596 --> 02:55:37.176]  Study hard.
[02:55:37.457 --> 02:55:38.637]  Graduate top of your class.
[02:55:38.877 --> 02:55:39.978]  You'll go to an Ivy League school.
[02:55:40.038 --> 02:55:41.078]  I did Columbia University.
[02:55:41.378 --> 02:55:42.559]  And the world is your oyster.
[02:55:43.059 --> 02:55:45.280]  And from that moment on, I knew everything was going to be great.
[02:55:45.960 --> 02:55:46.901]  Who cares if I'm Jewish?
[02:55:47.181 --> 02:55:48.161]  Who cares if you're black?
[02:55:48.562 --> 02:55:50.002]  I went to all-black high school, by the way.
[02:55:50.282 --> 02:55:50.843]  And I made it.
[02:55:51.083 --> 02:55:52.763]  And if you didn't, it's not because you're black.
[02:55:52.783 --> 02:55:53.924]  It's because you didn't study.
[02:55:54.428 --> 02:56:03.895]  It's because you fooled around too much, because you got a chick pregnant, because you played too much basketball, because you played too much while I was studying, because you went to too many parties while I was studying.
[02:56:04.315 --> 02:56:05.236]  That's why you didn't make it.
[02:56:05.576 --> 02:56:07.998]  Color of your skin has literally nothing to do with it.
[02:56:08.018 --> 02:56:08.798]  I won't say zero.
[02:56:09.178 --> 02:56:10.419]  I'll say that's five percent.
[02:56:10.779 --> 02:56:17.104]  Ninety-five percent is your work ethic and your attitude, hopefully positive, and what you bring to the ball game.
[02:56:17.725 --> 02:56:18.025]  Okay?
[02:56:18.345 --> 02:56:24.009]  And if people of color would understand that, they would change their entire outcomes in life.
[02:56:24.389 --> 02:56:26.251]  It's all about attitude.
[02:56:26.691 --> 02:56:32.575]  And Jews, the prejudice against Jews and the hatred against Jews has never been higher than at this very moment.
[02:56:33.275 --> 02:56:39.999]  And the history of Jews, bad or worse than any race or any religion or any creed in the history of mankind.
[02:56:40.420 --> 02:56:42.621]  And yet Jews continue to make it big.
[02:56:43.282 --> 02:56:43.842]  Make it big.
[02:56:44.713 --> 02:56:45.974]  They make it in every profession.
[02:56:46.314 --> 02:56:53.579]  Lawyers, doctors, architects, stockbrokers, investment bankers, the head of media corporations, head of billion-dollar Hollywood companies.
[02:56:54.159 --> 02:56:57.101]  You don't worry about what the color of your skin is or what your religion is.
[02:56:57.681 --> 02:56:59.882]  You fight and you attack relentlessly.
[02:57:00.183 --> 02:57:04.585]  And in America, anything is possible and nothing is impossible.
[02:57:04.986 --> 02:57:07.547]  That's why I wrote the book, The Power of Relentless.
[02:57:07.967 --> 02:57:12.110]  That's my favorite book of all time, The Power of Relentless by Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:57:12.370 --> 02:57:13.631]  Go grab a copy at Amazon.
[02:57:14.092 --> 02:57:16.822]  It'll teach you how to be successful in life.
[02:57:18.187 --> 02:57:19.693]  My website, rootforamerica.com.
[02:57:20.805 --> 02:57:21.445]  How do you reach me?

[02:57:38.092 --> 02:57:40.613]  Here's how we get revenge and take back America.
[02:57:40.633 --> 02:57:42.354]  The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:57:42.654 --> 02:57:45.235]  And I've got all their names and all their contact information.
[02:57:45.515 --> 02:57:46.656]  Have yourselves a great day!
[02:57:47.076 --> 02:57:49.178]  We'll see you next Tuesday where I guest host Alex Jones.

[02:57:53.141 --> 02:57:53.821]  I'm Wade on the Root.
[02:57:54.181 --> 02:57:54.562]  War!
[02:57:54.882 --> 02:57:55.182]  The Root!
[02:57:56.822 --> 02:57:57.822]  is on fire.

[03:00:11.941 --> 03:00:23.847]  We were one of the first national talk shows to expose satellite tracking and how government and corporations and hackers and other criminal groups are using it to steal your identity and sell your information.
[03:00:25.026 --> 03:00:38.234]  Everybody out there watching right now has had the apps and the phone companies and the big tech companies track your data, create a dossier, and sell it to hundreds, if not thousands, of different organizations.
[03:00:38.674 --> 03:00:44.358]  And they use this data to collectively screw over not just the people of America, but the people of the world.

[03:00:52.643 --> 03:00:57.949]  Made in America systems that the military uses that are also very, very affordable.
[03:00:58.350 --> 03:01:04.557]  So he set out to find out who has the main contracts to supply the Pentagon, the FBI, and others.
[03:01:05.708 --> 03:01:07.550]  We finally made contact over a year ago.
[03:01:08.090 --> 03:01:11.894]  We put in an order more than six months ago, and they came in, ladies and gentlemen.
