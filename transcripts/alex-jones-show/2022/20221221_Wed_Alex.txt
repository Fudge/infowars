[00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:01.887]  Wednesday live, World War III alert.
[00:00:02.547 --> 00:00:07.250]  Ukrainian dictator Zelensky visits Washington, demands hundreds of billions of dollars in support for nuclear war.
[00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:15.214]  And he fired missiles into Poland a month ago and said the Russians did it and demanded nuclear strikes on Russia, hoping we would just pull the trigger.
[00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:16.515]  I mean, what is he thinking?
[00:00:19.557 --> 00:00:22.318]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:22.178 --> 00:00:29.178]  worldwide in defense of human liberty. It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.178 --> 00:00:46.177]  [Music]
[00:00:46.177 --> 00:00:51.177]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:58.177]  [Music]
[00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:02.638]  A key component of human life is enlightenment.
[00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:07.783]  The awakening from the darkness of deception into the light of truth.
[00:01:08.344 --> 00:01:12.507]  The so-called Great Awakening has really been going on forever.
[00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:20.434]  And before MAGA and QAnon, the consensus was that the banks were at the top of the criminal pyramid structure.
[00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:31.446]   And while many of us assumed that a hidden hand was pulling their strings as well, We realized that their main goal was a digital currency and a cashless society.
[00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:34.249]  It was the subject of several documentaries.
[00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:40.736]  The ultimate goal that these people have in mind is the goal to create a one world government.
[00:01:41.812 --> 00:01:43.214]  Run by the banking industry.
[00:01:43.254 --> 00:01:44.175]  Run by the bankers.
[00:01:45.136 --> 00:01:45.257]  Right?
[00:01:45.297 --> 00:01:46.318]  There'll be no more cash.
[00:01:46.778 --> 00:01:48.501]  And this is getting me straight from Rockefeller himself.
[00:01:48.521 --> 00:01:49.762]  This is what they want to accomplish.
[00:01:50.523 --> 00:01:52.045]  And all money will be in your chips.
[00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:58.353]  And, if you're like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just turn off your chip.
[00:01:59.505 --> 00:02:00.226]  And you have nothing.
[00:02:00.667 --> 00:02:01.668]  You can't buy foods.
[00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:03.390]  You can't do anything.
[00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.772]  It's total control of the people.
[00:02:04.852 --> 00:02:08.838]  And that ship's connected to a database that has your purchasing records, what you do, what you sell.
[00:02:08.858 --> 00:02:09.438]  Everything.
[00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:10.620]  Everything is in there.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.847]  And it was also commonly discussed that they'll likely use Big Pharma to get us there.
[00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:17.688]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires.
[00:02:17.828 --> 00:02:18.949]  Yes, they manipulate.
[00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.730]  Yes, there are secret societies.
[00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:23.192]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history.
[00:02:23.512 --> 00:02:40.245]  And yes, today, in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[00:02:40.865 --> 00:02:54.612]  And by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources, by centralizing and socializing health care, the state becomes God, basically, when it comes to your health.
[00:02:54.972 --> 00:03:01.936]  And then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us, we then basically get shoved into their system.
[00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:07.697]  But now it's as if everyone has just accepted it and found something else to fight about.
[00:03:08.117 --> 00:03:14.379]  Because the cashless society is being rolled out right now and very few people seem bothered by it.
[00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:26.762]  In November of 2019, right before COVID, the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School had a live tabletop exercise called Digital Currency Wars.
[00:03:27.262 --> 00:03:41.276]  Which looked at how the United States can continue to leverage economic power in a world of national digital currencies, such as the Chinese digital yuan, which is already heavily competing in trade against the U.S.
[00:03:41.316 --> 00:03:46.461]  dollar and seems to be at the forefront of centralized digital currencies.
[00:03:47.062 --> 00:03:48.824]  And it has an expiry date.
[00:03:49.364 --> 00:03:54.447]  If you don't spend it by then, it becomes worthless, so people can no longer save money.
[00:03:55.047 --> 00:04:05.313]  The Bank of International Settlements has announced that the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations, and will have technologies to enforce it.
[00:04:05.993 --> 00:04:12.837]  The Central Bank of Brazil is planning to launch their centralized digital currency in 2024.
[00:04:13.577 --> 00:04:15.358]  Israel is about to launch theirs.
[00:04:15.899 --> 00:04:19.561]  And the Bank of England is now preparing a UK digital currency.
[00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:25.604]  Italy's new Prime Minister, Meloni, is speaking out against the cashless society.
[00:04:26.044 --> 00:04:28.706]  But she seems to stand alone on the world stage.
[00:04:29.546 --> 00:04:36.995]  In the Federal Reserve's digital currency scheme, it appears that Hedera and Quant will be used on the technology side.
[00:04:37.496 --> 00:04:39.858]  They are already connected to everything.
[00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:45.545]  The cashless society is here, but everyone is talking about Hunter Biden's laptop.
[00:04:46.266 --> 00:04:51.950]  The goal was never to put an old senile puppet into the presidency to run havoc.
[00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.932]  The goal was to create a cashless society.
[00:04:55.473 --> 00:05:03.258]  And so while bringing Joe Biden to justice may feel like a victory, the tyrants are still getting exactly what they wanted.
[00:05:03.718 --> 00:05:07.001]  And once it's all said and done, then who will save you?
[00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:12.865]  And if you're like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just turn off your chip.
[00:05:14.045 --> 00:05:14.766]  And you have nothing.
[00:05:15.186 --> 00:05:16.186]  You can't buy foods.
[00:05:16.967 --> 00:05:17.968]  You can't do anything.
[00:05:18.048 --> 00:05:20.429]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.551]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:24.792]  It's Wednesday, December 21st, 2022.
[00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:32.971]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live.
[00:05:32.971 --> 00:05:41.850]  It's Wednesday, December 21st, 2022.
[00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.010]  Well Zelensky is a dictator.
[00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:49.370]   Zelensky has banned the oldest and largest church in Ukraine.
[00:05:49.392 --> 00:05:50.933]  He has taken over all the media.
[00:05:51.773 --> 00:05:57.155]  He has tortured to death tens of thousands of innocent people on record and put it on national television.
[00:05:58.015 --> 00:05:59.636]  The man is a complete monster.
[00:06:00.656 --> 00:06:06.878]  And he has an endless list of disgusting Hollywood trash and other globalists fawning after him.
[00:06:06.898 --> 00:06:11.520]  Now does that mean Russia's perfect and Vladimir Putin's perfect and what they did is good?
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.780]  No.
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.261]  It's been a proxy war for nine years.
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:20.104]  Even CNN has top globalists like George Soros on to brag about it.
[00:06:20.885 --> 00:06:23.587]  And now it's rapidly escalating into full-on nuclear war.
[00:06:23.868 --> 00:06:25.689]  Even Henry Kissinger said it should all stop.
[00:06:27.151 --> 00:06:28.012]  But it's not stopping.
[00:06:29.593 --> 00:06:37.520]  Because the Western political kleptocratic elite is using it as a giant money laundering operation, endangering all of us.
[00:06:39.182 --> 00:06:40.083]  This is madness.
[00:06:41.775 --> 00:06:42.756]  This is insanity.
[00:06:42.776 --> 00:06:52.542]  This is what you see in the very final stages of a collapsing empire, where it attacks those without and its minions within.
[00:06:52.562 --> 00:06:59.867]  Zelensky, who was elected, but Hitler was elected too, then he became a dictator.
[00:07:00.528 --> 00:07:04.096]   The dictatorial usurpations Of the people.
[00:07:04.517 --> 00:07:12.562]  And similar to Hitler, he even has Nazi forces that hailed Hitler serving him as his main Praetorian Guard and shock troops.
[00:07:12.602 --> 00:07:14.843]  You can't make this up.
[00:07:15.624 --> 00:07:18.826]  That much of World War II was obviously fought in Ukraine.
[00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:26.471]  And he is now in DC to address Congress and to have fawning meetings with the Democratic Party.
[00:07:26.491 --> 00:07:40.425]   We have people like Mitch McConnell coming out with a huge lie and saying, Republicans have been polled and they believe the war in Ukraine and the war against Russia is the number one issue that Republicans support.
[00:07:41.285 --> 00:07:42.846]  But I've seen all those same polls.
[00:07:42.886 --> 00:07:46.087]  It's 80 plus percent of Republican voters don't want the war.
[00:07:46.887 --> 00:07:51.348]  If you combine Democrat voters, it's almost 75 percent on average of Americans polled.
[00:07:51.368 --> 00:07:52.608]  You can look it up for yourself.
[00:07:54.089 --> 00:07:55.349]  So he inverted the numbers.
[00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:57.990]  He's saying the vast majority of Republicans want this war.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.702]  When it's actually the opposite, and it's a bipartisan issue.
[00:08:04.723 --> 00:08:20.673]  No, the number one issue is inflation, and the economy, and the COVID tyranny, and the open borders, and the fentanyl, and the pedo, drag queen time, and the critical race theory, and the entire leftist agenda, but we can't get out from under it because of massive election fraud.
[00:08:24.815 --> 00:08:38.003]   But we have Mitch McConnell, nevertheless, so I can cue the clip up, saying, That providing assistance for Ukrainians to defeat the Russians is the number one priority for the United States right now.
[00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:44.048]  According to most Republicans, that's how we see the challenges confronting the country at the moment.
[00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:48.892]  So the big issue is not the insider trading by both party leadership.
[00:08:48.952 --> 00:08:51.794]  It's not new lockdowns they're trying to prepare and set up.
[00:08:51.834 --> 00:08:51.975]  No, no.
[00:08:52.015 --> 00:08:53.416]  It's not the collapsed border.
[00:08:53.456 --> 00:08:54.497]  It's not the devalued currency.
[00:08:57.301 --> 00:09:04.831]  Backing Zelensky that is arresting his peaceful opposition, outlawing all other political parties, including liberal parties that have been aligned with him.
[00:09:05.612 --> 00:09:10.178]  When you outlaw all your political opposition, including your allies, you're a dictator.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:14.504]  When you ban the biggest, oldest church in the country, you're a dictator.
[00:09:15.734 --> 00:09:20.535]  When you arrest people and torture them and imprison them just because they don't support the war, you're a dictator.
[00:09:21.035 --> 00:09:32.217]  They put it on national TV all over the world and in Ukraine, where they come to the house, knock down the door, drag away the husband and say, you were seen on social media saying the war should end and that Zelensky should do a peace deal.
[00:09:35.398 --> 00:09:39.999]  And they scream and yell, I fought the Ukrainian military, I'm a patriot, but yes, I don't support this war.
[00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:42.259]  And they start beating him right there on the street.
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.501]   And the left Loves it.
[00:09:46.662 --> 00:09:54.208]  They love shipping 100 plus million dollars of weapons to the Ukrainians, including reportedly millions of small arms.
[00:09:54.147 --> 00:10:04.627]   They can have fully automatic guns, but citizens shouldn't be able to have anything here.
[00:10:04.627 --> 00:10:05.787]  So that's where we are right now.
[00:10:05.798 --> 00:10:07.339]  Here's Mitch McConnell telling the big lie.
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:13.164]  Making sure the Defense Department can deal with the major threats.
[00:10:13.996 --> 00:10:22.382]  Coming from Russia and China, providing assistance for the Ukrainians to defeat the Russians.
[00:10:23.323 --> 00:10:27.406]  That's the number one priority for the United States right now.
[00:10:28.987 --> 00:10:36.233]  According to most Republicans, that's sort of how we see the challenges confronting the country at the moment.
[00:10:37.534 --> 00:10:41.717]  Maybe he's talking about the Republican leadership, but the point is he's being deceptive.
[00:10:45.458 --> 00:10:51.324]  Mitch McConnell breaks with Kevin McCarthy, pledges to send more aid to Ukraine if Republicans win the Senate.
[00:10:51.344 --> 00:10:51.744]  Remember that?
[00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:53.846]  Just a few months ago?
[00:10:53.866 --> 00:10:58.170]  We're going to be drilling into all of this today.
[00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:10.422]  The war in Ukraine, the escalation, Henry Kissinger's warning of impending nuclear war, Putin's ongoing warnings, now missile strikes going on for a month inside Russia with US-NATO backing and coordination.
[00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:16.951]  Russia's preparing a new offensive out of Belarus, north of Ukraine.
[00:11:18.311 --> 00:11:20.772]  I want to open the phones up on that subject.
[00:11:21.412 --> 00:11:24.033]  We had great calls yesterday as we talked about two subjects.
[00:11:24.053 --> 00:11:29.794]  The imploding border, poison vaccines, and your take on them.
[00:11:31.155 --> 00:11:33.235]  And now today I'd like to add a third topic.
[00:11:34.336 --> 00:11:35.236]  Zelensky's visit.
[00:11:36.465 --> 00:11:45.787]  Your view on it, where you think it's all going, and obviously being used as a political smoke screen for the new cashless society rollout that is happening as we speak.
[00:11:45.827 --> 00:11:54.969]  And you know, Greg Reese files so many really deep, penetrating, thought-provoking reports, but we can put on screen his latest video that just dropped this morning.
[00:11:57.889 --> 00:12:04.251]  I can say hands down it's the most important report he's ever put out on the eve of a cashless society.
[00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:14.310]  It's only four and a half minutes long.
[00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.710]  It really lays out.
[00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:28.672]  And while many of us assumed that a hidden hand was pulling their strings as well, we realized that their main goal was a digital currency and a cashless society.
[00:12:29.192 --> 00:12:31.493]  It was the subject of several documentaries.
[00:12:31.533 --> 00:12:37.975]  The ultimate goal that these people have in mind is the goal to create a one world government.
[00:12:39.062 --> 00:12:40.463]  Run by the banking industry.
[00:12:40.503 --> 00:12:41.424]  Run by the bankers.
[00:12:42.385 --> 00:12:42.505]  Right?
[00:12:42.525 --> 00:12:43.565]  There'll be no more cash.
[00:12:44.026 --> 00:12:45.747]  And this is getting me straight from Rockefeller himself.
[00:12:45.767 --> 00:12:47.008]  This is what they want to accomplish.
[00:12:47.769 --> 00:12:49.290]  And all money will be in your chips.
[00:12:50.191 --> 00:12:55.595]  And, if you're like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just turn off your chip.
[00:12:56.758 --> 00:12:57.479]  And you have nothing.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.921]  You can't buy foods.
[00:12:59.722 --> 00:13:00.643]  You can't do anything.
[00:13:00.723 --> 00:13:02.025]  It's total control of the people.
[00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:06.431]  And that chip's connected to a database that has your purchasing records, what you do, what you sell.
[00:13:06.451 --> 00:13:06.691]  Everything.
[00:13:06.912 --> 00:13:07.853]  Everything is in there.
[00:13:07.913 --> 00:13:13.080]  And it was also commonly discussed that they'll likely use Big Pharma to get us there.
[00:13:13.059 --> 00:13:16.268]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires. Yes, they manipulate.
[00:13:16.268 --> 00:13:18.059]  Yes, there are secret societies.
[00:13:18.059 --> 00:13:23.459]   Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history. And yes, today in 2002, there is
[00:13:23.459 --> 00:13:31.959]   a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing for worldwide government,
[00:13:31.959 --> 00:13:37.758]  a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[00:13:37.758 --> 00:13:43.258]   So again, there's just a little bit of the report on the eve of a cashless society.
[00:13:43.258 --> 00:13:49.759]   And as Tucker Carlson said a few weeks ago, if they get these global digital currencies
[00:13:49.759 --> 00:14:00.259]   in place, all centralized, run by the UN, literally selected and designed by the WEF,
[00:14:00.259 --> 00:14:10.259]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:14:01.294 --> 00:14:03.676]  The hell that comes with this is just unspeakable.
[00:14:04.236 --> 00:14:06.198]  So it really is the big front and center issue.
[00:14:07.018 --> 00:14:13.844]  And again, they're using the viral release and the rest of it as the pretext to bring it in on the back of the vaccine passport.
[00:14:14.244 --> 00:14:15.905]  And it's now all admitted, it's all here.
[00:14:16.186 --> 00:14:17.407]  Are your churches talking about it?
[00:14:17.807 --> 00:14:18.287]  No, they're not.
[00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:19.608]  We'll be right back.
[00:14:20.629 --> 00:14:29.196]  God created the heaven and the earth, and the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
[00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:33.463]  And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
[00:14:34.684 --> 00:14:37.265]  And God said, Let there be light.
[00:14:38.105 --> 00:14:38.926]  And there was light.
[00:14:39.986 --> 00:14:49.890]  And God saw the light, that it was good, and divided the light from the darkness.
[00:14:49.909 --> 00:14:56.909]   And God called the late day, and the darkness he called night, and the evening and the morning were the first day.
[00:14:56.909 --> 00:15:03.909]   And God said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters."
[00:15:03.909 --> 00:15:11.169]   And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above
[00:15:11.169 --> 00:15:11.909]  the firmament.
[00:15:12.909 --> 00:15:19.909]   And it was so. And God called the firmament, and the evening and the morning were the second day.
[00:15:19.909 --> 00:15:28.139]   And God said, "Let the waters of the Dead Sea gather together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And
[00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:28.909]  it was so.
[00:15:28.909 --> 00:15:36.909]   And God called the dry land earth, and the gathering together of the waters called East Sea.
[00:15:37.909 --> 00:15:48.319]   And God saw that it was good. And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a merry Christmas, and
[00:15:48.319 --> 00:15:52.909]  God bless all of you. All of you on the good earth.
[00:15:52.909 --> 00:16:17.909]  [Music]
[00:16:17.909 --> 00:16:29.572]   Find this video and more at band.video Hundreds of new important reports the enemy doesn't want you to see every single day.
[00:16:30.253 --> 00:16:36.700]  Not just InfoWars and our intrepid crew, but hundreds of other banned individuals fighting on at Banned.Video.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:43.287]  I hope you'll join us there and I hope you'll share the videos and trigger the chain reaction of awakening.
[00:16:45.071 --> 00:16:48.754]  All right, so I want to get into the borders, the poison shots.
[00:16:49.515 --> 00:16:56.601]  I want to get into Zelensky's visit, where he says that $45 billion additional this month is not enough.
[00:16:56.621 --> 00:16:59.924]  It's now well over $150 billion that we know of.
[00:17:00.805 --> 00:17:02.766]  I guess that'll bring it up to almost $200 billion.
[00:17:02.786 --> 00:17:03.427]  That's not enough.
[00:17:04.628 --> 00:17:06.169]  So much of it's being laundered right back.
[00:17:06.189 --> 00:17:07.470]  That's why he's this big hero.
[00:17:08.909 --> 00:17:15.213]  And the Russians are getting slaughtered, obviously, because they're up against super high-tech weapons, all directed by the Pentagon and NATO.
[00:17:15.993 --> 00:17:17.114]  This is the robot wars.
[00:17:18.075 --> 00:17:19.356]  The first big robot war.
[00:17:20.096 --> 00:17:23.858]  There have been autonomous drones, obviously, for decades and decades, but now it's on.
[00:17:23.878 --> 00:17:26.460]  I want to take your calls on those subjects.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.302]  Those are three huge subjects.
[00:17:31.003 --> 00:17:33.865]  Obviously, more Twitter files were released yesterday, last night.
[00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.231]  And it's everything I told you in spades, because I've experienced it, I've gone through it.
[00:17:38.611 --> 00:17:42.872]  I went back and tracked the legislation that Obama signed to get it done, and his executive orders.
[00:17:44.173 --> 00:17:53.075]  I gotta tell you, it's very frustrating to be telling people this seven years ago, six years ago, and then now it's, oh, there'll be Pulitzer Prizes for this breaking.
[00:17:53.495 --> 00:17:54.776]  It's not that I even want the credit.
[00:17:56.136 --> 00:18:00.797]  I've seen our enemy run circles around us because people are so naive.
[00:18:01.637 --> 00:18:02.737]  Remember all the CNN reports?
[00:18:02.777 --> 00:18:03.938]  Jones is insane.
[00:18:04.418 --> 00:18:09.059]  He says there's a secret FBI-CIA program interfacing with big tech to surveil and censor.
[00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:11.759]  Jones claims President Trump's being spied on.
[00:18:11.819 --> 00:18:13.180]  Jones claims U.S.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.340]  intelligence agencies created the Steele dossier.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.040]  Why, it's just preposterous.
[00:18:18.341 --> 00:18:19.501]  But it wasn't preposterous.
[00:18:22.222 --> 00:18:46.713]  I received from a connection of Joe Arpaio seven years ago, before Trump was even elected, a DEA list that we redacted, only put parts of out, then we erased it, from the NSA, of their interface with the NSA, spying on my phone line, Trump's phone lines, everything.
[00:18:48.594 --> 00:18:49.114]  Think about that.
[00:18:51.141 --> 00:18:54.042]  And of course we knew it wasn't just the DEA interfacing with the NSA.
[00:18:54.702 --> 00:18:58.243]  It was more than a hundred agencies, not just the 18 intelligence agencies.
[00:18:59.744 --> 00:19:04.045]  And now we know they gave top-secret security clearances to the big tech people.
[00:19:04.606 --> 00:19:20.171]  Not just the CEOs, not just the head officers, but hundreds and hundreds of people that we know of inside the tech companies, in each company, to engage in criminal racketeering operations.
[00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:28.590]  This is a million times worse, conservatively, when I say that I mean a million times worse than anything Richard Nixon ever even imagined.
[00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:41.116]  And what Senator Frank Church's committee exposed in the late 1970s of FBI surveillance and censorship, that was the equivalent of a grain of sand, and was terrible, at the beach.
[00:19:42.316 --> 00:19:44.117]  So what Nixon did was a grain of sand.
[00:19:45.878 --> 00:19:48.980]  What the globalists have done is the entire beach.
[00:19:50.816 --> 00:19:57.780]  And that's why Elon Musk has said to Congressman Schiff, who's basically calling for his criminal investigation arrest.
[00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.100]  Schiff's coming after Musk.
[00:19:59.581 --> 00:20:08.345]  Musk asked Schiff if he would approve state censorship and advocate Modern Church Commission to investigate FBI corruption.
[00:20:08.846 --> 00:20:20.072]  And Schiff responded with a properly Orwellian term, a proper Orwellian response, saying, I don't support censorship.
[00:20:21.141 --> 00:20:22.802]  But I also don't support hate speech.
[00:20:24.683 --> 00:20:32.288]  Ah, so exposing Hunter Biden's laptop and he's on the laptop and recording saying, I get orders from the Chinese head of the intelligence agency.
[00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:36.591]  And I don't know what to do because now the Chinese head's been disappeared.
[00:20:36.611 --> 00:20:38.472]  Xi Jinping's arrested him.
[00:20:38.552 --> 00:20:40.273]  What does that mean for me and my dad?
[00:20:40.293 --> 00:20:42.955]  And the hundreds of millions we get from him.
[00:20:43.555 --> 00:20:44.996]  I've served China well.
[00:20:45.016 --> 00:20:49.259]  These are audio messages, audio files he's sending to people.
[00:20:50.523 --> 00:20:53.144]  Dad, where's the spy chief?
[00:20:54.065 --> 00:20:56.886]  He usually calls me every day and tells me what to do.
[00:20:58.367 --> 00:20:59.168]  That's on the laptop.
[00:20:59.188 --> 00:21:00.208]  He played it probably 50 times.
[00:21:01.329 --> 00:21:03.750]  Dad, my Chinese handler's gone!
[00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:05.651]  What do I do, Daddy?
[00:21:06.452 --> 00:21:08.833]  He told me to follow orders from Xi Jinping!
[00:21:09.733 --> 00:21:12.115]  I did what he was telling me and now what?
[00:21:14.796 --> 00:21:15.457]  Daddy!
[00:21:15.557 --> 00:21:16.057]  Daddy!
[00:21:20.168 --> 00:21:28.559]  And there was the FBI, the whole time behind the scenes, threatening Twitter at one point that you're not doing enough, banning anyone talking about it.
[00:21:30.201 --> 00:21:37.369]  What do you think the FBI will do, the Justice Department, the CIA, if Congress doesn't rein them in?
[00:21:39.437 --> 00:21:41.799]  It's easy to say abolish them and everybody's been saying abolish them.
[00:21:41.819 --> 00:21:42.479]  Great, abolish them!
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:51.266]  But the entire government's full of spies like this at every level that think it's their right to spy on you, bully you, lie about you, attack you.
[00:21:51.366 --> 00:21:54.828]  It's all a giant maze of crazy people.
[00:21:56.790 --> 00:22:03.795]  What lunatic would want to work in an agency like that and do things like this when it's textbook crazy and illegal?
[00:22:04.396 --> 00:22:08.218]  And it's illegal because societies fall that have stuff in them like this.
[00:22:09.329 --> 00:22:34.762]  Oh, but they're the liberal Harvard and Princeton elite, and they, when they do things that would make Hitler blush, or Xi Jinping proud, or Kim Jong-un envious, or Fidel Castro amazed and admiring, it's just, oh, that's what we do!
[00:22:34.982 --> 00:22:35.542]  Ha ha ha!
[00:22:35.822 --> 00:22:36.323]  Ha ha ha!
[00:22:37.262 --> 00:22:48.611]  FBI agent Elvis Chan, pretty cool name, had worked closely with Twitter, especially Mr. Roth, to suppress information about the 2020 election fraud.
[00:22:49.131 --> 00:22:54.195]  Let's make him famous, says adorable patriot Todd.
[00:22:55.056 --> 00:22:55.796]  Making famous?
[00:22:55.816 --> 00:22:56.537]  He's already famous.
[00:22:56.977 --> 00:22:58.058]  He's a rock star.
[00:22:58.738 --> 00:22:59.759]  He runs your life.
[00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:01.480]  And he's just getting started.
[00:23:01.841 --> 00:23:03.022]  The death camps are built.
[00:23:03.342 --> 00:23:04.483]  They're called COVID centers.
[00:23:05.658 --> 00:23:14.825]  So I don't want to sit here and say I told you so, but I do want people to listen to me and understand that I'm not playing games and I know what I'm talking about instead of my guest, instead of our callers.
[00:23:15.966 --> 00:23:24.313]  Speaking of that, I'm going to give the number out here in a moment, take calls throughout the full broadcast just like we did yesterday on these big topics.
[00:23:24.373 --> 00:23:26.154]  So start your engines, I'll give the number out here in a moment.
[00:23:27.435 --> 00:23:35.320]   But do you understand I specifically analyzed the Deep State Stay Behind Networks of Obama.
[00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:36.221]  I tracked the money.
[00:23:37.121 --> 00:23:46.665]  I hired multiple high-powered law firms and paid them a lot of money to vet it all, put it into briefs, and I had them hand-delivered to President Trump in 2017 and 2018.
[00:23:50.387 --> 00:23:54.089]  Now, everybody knew what was going on, but everybody was scared.
[00:23:55.529 --> 00:24:19.088]   They then tried to set me up As punishment for this, with the FBI, as a Russian agent, and of course, I exposed it all, had lawyers write letters to the FBI, confronted them with it, and then the FBI and others are like, well, let's not discuss this, national security, blah, blah, blah, but the point is, we know you're a very loyal American, and all this crap
[00:24:20.399 --> 00:24:32.310]  So what they've done is they have targeted the American people, they have turned the spy agencies loose on us, and I was telling you this four years ago that they specifically, five years ago, have targeted us.
[00:24:33.351 --> 00:24:34.932]  And we're the beta test, okay?
[00:24:36.794 --> 00:24:38.255]  Now you see all this out there.
[00:24:38.675 --> 00:24:40.637]  And if you cower to this, they're gonna win.
[00:24:41.738 --> 00:24:51.463]   But let me tell The bureaucrats and the professors and the people in the government agencies and the military and everywhere that are mid-level and high up that are going along with this.
[00:24:52.023 --> 00:24:57.626]  If you've ever opened a history book or even seen recent history, there's no honor among thieves.
[00:24:57.826 --> 00:24:59.887]  Why would anyone get rid of our checks and balances?
[00:25:00.247 --> 00:25:08.946]   Why would anyone get rid of A free republic and then bring in a tyranny just because you get to sit on top of the tyranny for a while.
[00:25:09.666 --> 00:25:22.452]  Anybody that studies tyrannies knows that it always destroys who puts it in charge, and it always destroys the minions that bring the new corrupt elite into power.
[00:25:22.992 --> 00:25:26.354]  I saw a Netflix special about the Ottoman Empire.
[00:25:26.374 --> 00:25:29.755]  I don't watch a lot of TV, but I watched it a few weeks ago.
[00:25:29.775 --> 00:25:32.597]  Kind of binge watched it over a week at night.
[00:25:33.775 --> 00:25:40.380]  It was like six, seven, eight episodes, and it was about the fall of Constantinople that then became Istanbul.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:26:10.310]   And I'd read a few history books about it and knew it, but it reminded me, because it's such an accurate historical representation, that when the Ottoman leader took over Constantinople, what was left of the Roman Empire, now about 600 years ago, he killed all the traders that they'd been working with inside the city Who had helped bring down the king and helped bring down what was left of the Roman Christian Empire.
[00:26:11.190 --> 00:26:12.111]  The eastern part of it.
[00:26:12.771 --> 00:26:17.973]  Rome itself, in what is Italy today, had fallen to Alaric, the Visigoth chieftain in 410.
[00:26:18.513 --> 00:26:31.318]  So it was over a thousand years later that I think he was like the twelfth in line of Augustine that built the system and built that fell.
[00:26:31.418 --> 00:26:37.619]   And the king The Christian King, they were Orthodox, fought to the death in the city.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:49.400]   But as soon as Mamet, if I pronounced that right, the Muslim leader took over, and he already had a big empire, And his dad defeated a bunch of other groups.
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:55.302]  As soon as he took over, he said, bring me everybody that was our spies on their side.
[00:26:55.803 --> 00:26:56.643]  And he had them all killed.
[00:26:57.163 --> 00:26:59.884]  And they came in and said, sir, thank you, we can't wait for your empire.
[00:26:59.924 --> 00:27:04.066]  And he said, how dare you do this to your people and your emperor?
[00:27:04.626 --> 00:27:06.407]  You are going to be tortured to death for this.
[00:27:10.889 --> 00:27:11.950]  It's always done that way.
[00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:16.031]  You never leave the traitors that lower the drawbridge.
[00:27:16.352 --> 00:27:34.023]   You never Give the traitors that tell the Ottomans when the Christians are going to launch a counterattack against the Ottomans in the ocean right off the coast of the city.
[00:27:34.624 --> 00:27:39.762]   But they did that because they thought, well, This army of 100,000 troops is too big.
[00:27:39.782 --> 00:27:41.224]  We've only got 7,000 troops.
[00:27:41.604 --> 00:27:44.387]  And so I'm going to go ahead and start just preparing for the fall.
[00:27:44.748 --> 00:27:50.674]  And the Muslims almost lost, and they wouldn't have won if it wasn't for the traitors inside.
[00:27:50.694 --> 00:27:52.616]  They were giving them all the intelligence.
[00:27:53.157 --> 00:28:07.373]   Do you think the Muslim warlord that was now the emperor of Rome Do you think he was going to leave a couple hundred traders that were high up who were jockeying for control in his new system?
[00:28:09.515 --> 00:28:11.356]  And that's why I go back to that.
[00:28:11.396 --> 00:28:14.118]  You people that join with evil are idiots.
[00:28:14.198 --> 00:28:15.680]  And I've explained how this works.
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:27.977]   If the globalists completely take over and win, I will be approached and I'll be given one last chance to join and work for the New World Order because I am an honorable person.
[00:28:28.818 --> 00:28:35.243]  They know if I actually sold out and got on my knee to them, I would actually serve them and would not work against them.
[00:28:35.583 --> 00:28:36.864]  I've never bowed my knee.
[00:28:37.085 --> 00:28:38.065]  I've never served them.
[00:28:38.306 --> 00:28:39.527]  I've never taken their offers.
[00:28:39.747 --> 00:28:40.948]  I've never double dealt.
[00:28:41.148 --> 00:28:42.709]  And they tried to hire me more than 15 times.
[00:28:47.116 --> 00:28:49.698]  And the last few times they said, too bad for you, you're going to get it now.
[00:28:49.979 --> 00:28:51.100]  And I said, you're going to get it.
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:52.561]  Look at history, you're going to fail.
[00:28:53.562 --> 00:28:55.163]  So, that's the level I'm at.
[00:28:55.244 --> 00:28:59.748]  And it's not about bragging to the audience, it's about realizing the level you're at when you tune into this broadcast.
[00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:03.952]  This is the real level here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:04.752 --> 00:29:10.618]  And all you idiots bringing in this tyranny, they're going to get rid of this whole left-wing revolution if they win in, I'd say, five, ten years.
[00:29:10.658 --> 00:29:12.820]  This is their reorganization, their re-education.
[00:29:14.093 --> 00:29:15.534]  Their cultural revolution.
[00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:22.918]  But when they're done, if you look at what they did to Mao and his cultural revolution, they were done, they locked up his wife, poisoned Mao, and moved on.
[00:29:24.939 --> 00:29:25.660]  And it's the same thing.
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:36.526]  So all of you idiots, I'm not talking to our general audience, but all of you people that serve the system, that tune in and laugh and giggle and love deception, love going along with evil, you're crapping in your own bed.
[00:29:36.706 --> 00:29:37.866]  You're burning down your own house.
[00:29:38.087 --> 00:29:39.327]  You're destroying your own future.
[00:29:39.407 --> 00:29:40.208]  You are fools.
[00:29:42.401 --> 00:29:43.922]  You are absolute fools.
[00:29:44.222 --> 00:29:51.548]  The first group that any revolution taking over gets rid of is the traitors that helped them get into power.
[00:29:54.191 --> 00:30:02.657]  The first order of business for the New World Order when they take over is getting rid of all of you.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.041]  But you're not going to listen.
[00:30:10.744 --> 00:30:11.665]  Maybe some of you are.
[00:30:13.012 --> 00:30:14.874]  But you just don't know the rules of history.
[00:30:18.097 --> 00:30:27.545]  Now, I'm going to give the number out, and we're taking calls on four huge subjects.
[00:30:29.347 --> 00:30:38.455]  The dictator Zelensky in DC now, and his big address coming up, and all the parties tonight, them demanding more than $45 billion is their latest promise for this month.
[00:30:39.926 --> 00:30:42.187]  The open borders totally collapsed and what's happening there.
[00:30:42.207 --> 00:30:43.487]  I got a lot of clips and news there.
[00:30:44.427 --> 00:30:45.228]  The poison shots.
[00:30:45.288 --> 00:30:46.128]  Maybe you love the shots.
[00:30:46.168 --> 00:30:48.268]  Call in and tell us your story about how great it was.
[00:30:48.328 --> 00:30:52.870]  Nobody ever calls in that thinks they had a good experience, but phones are open for it.
[00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.630]  We don't screen them other than a good clean phone line.
[00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.911]  You're ready to make your point.
[00:30:56.351 --> 00:30:57.451]  I'd love to hear from all of you.
[00:30:57.871 --> 00:30:59.392]  We're taking a lot of calls today.
[00:30:59.732 --> 00:31:00.952]  The toll free number is 877-789-2539.
[00:31:00.771 --> 00:31:11.851]  is 877-789-2539. 877-789-2539. 877-789-Alex.
[00:31:12.851 --> 00:31:14.575]  We had a lot of amazing calls yesterday.
[00:31:14.595 --> 00:31:18.122]  We're going to take your calls today on three subjects I mentioned.
[00:31:18.142 --> 00:31:18.763]  The fourth is...
[00:31:20.031 --> 00:31:32.715]  The intelligence agencies, illegally, with select corporations, shutting off their competition, going in and deplatforming new startup internet companies and harassing platforms like Parler and Gab and InfoWars.
[00:31:33.055 --> 00:31:34.935]  This is all illegal as hell.
[00:31:35.355 --> 00:31:38.316]  It's one thing if big tech wants to censor its competition and shut them out.
[00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:42.197]  That violates Section 230 and is wrong and is illegal and shouldn't be done.
[00:31:42.497 --> 00:31:53.746]   But when you collude with the government or a political party, And with the UN who brags that they direct, you know, that came out two months ago, the head of the UN Operations Bureau said, oh, we tell the big tech what to do.
[00:31:54.327 --> 00:31:56.549]  We already know that, but it's official.
[00:31:58.491 --> 00:32:05.038]  And it's illegal, just like having the UN tell the NGOs they control on the border, and the NGOs control the border patrol.
[00:32:05.138 --> 00:32:05.858]  It's all on record.
[00:32:05.938 --> 00:32:06.419]  It's illegal.
[00:32:06.639 --> 00:32:08.601]  Finally, Greg Abbott's opened a criminal investigation.
[00:32:08.841 --> 00:32:09.062]  Good!
[00:32:10.538 --> 00:32:13.143]  But this is all completely illegitimate, completely insane.
[00:32:13.443 --> 00:32:14.906]  On a scale of 1 to 10 of tyranny, it's a 10.
[00:32:15.847 --> 00:32:19.073]  And it always leads to giant camps, mass arrests and extermination.
[00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:20.495]  That's the next phase of this.
[00:32:21.915 --> 00:32:24.475]  once they get their cashless society in place.
[00:32:24.475 --> 00:32:25.556]  So those are the big topics.
[00:32:25.556 --> 00:32:26.875]  We talk cashless society as well.
[00:32:26.875 --> 00:32:34.195]   That's five topics, but just on those five topics, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex,
[00:32:34.195 --> 00:32:36.035]  your calls are coming up, stay with us.
[00:32:36.035 --> 00:32:37.076]  And we are back live.
[00:32:37.076 --> 00:32:38.035]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:32:38.035 --> 00:32:42.474]   I was giving an example of the fall of Constantinople almost 600 years ago,
[00:32:42.474 --> 00:32:47.035]   when the Muslim Ottoman Empire took it over with the help of traders within the gates.
[00:32:47.035 --> 00:32:52.995]   Some of the nobility thought they could make a better deal, thought that finally the city, after 23 plus previous
[00:32:52.995 --> 00:32:55.595]   attacks over the last thousand years, had not fallen.
[00:32:55.446 --> 00:32:56.766]  They thought it was time for it to fall.
[00:32:57.127 --> 00:33:01.548]  They thought they had better deals going on because they've been working with the Muslims on trade for a long time.
[00:33:01.968 --> 00:33:04.008]  And they all got tortured and executed for helping.
[00:33:04.468 --> 00:33:07.129]  And why do you think the Muslim emperor did that?
[00:33:07.609 --> 00:33:10.910]  He didn't just do it so that those traders wouldn't be around to sell him out.
[00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:17.573]  He did it so that the other people in his government would not ever think about double-crossing him.
[00:33:18.433 --> 00:33:21.854]  And again, I'm trying to explain to the minions of the New World Order something.
[00:33:22.975 --> 00:33:28.777]  There are historic rules that are followed in war for a reason.
[00:33:29.998 --> 00:33:33.679]  And the globalists above the little traitor class still follow those rules.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:46.524]   An example of that is the Head of the Russian military secretly made a trip a few months ago to the front lines of Ukraine.
[00:33:47.745 --> 00:33:49.726]  And it's now come out and Russia's confirmed it's true.
[00:33:51.248 --> 00:33:56.692]  And with the satellites and all their systems, they knew right where he was and could have killed him.
[00:33:56.712 --> 00:34:04.058]  Even though they killed 20 plus other Russian generals, they made the decision because he was the leader of the Russian military not to do it.
[00:34:04.158 --> 00:34:04.999]  You know, why do they do that?
[00:34:06.744 --> 00:34:12.607]  Why'd they let Napoleon go the first time they defeated him, then he came back and took over again?
[00:34:13.828 --> 00:34:19.491]  Because they want the rules set where if they ever get defeated, they get a get-out-of-jail-free card.
[00:34:21.833 --> 00:34:25.034]  They didn't let the head Russian general live because they liked him.
[00:34:25.315 --> 00:34:33.279]  They did it because they're continuing that art of chivalry forward, but only for the ruling elites.
[00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:37.379]   You don't get that same Rule because you're seen as an animal.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:45.783]  And I know I'm trying to talk to the animals that serve the New World Order and think there may be some humanity left in you, but just please, look at the economy falling apart.
[00:34:46.023 --> 00:34:47.124]  Look at things degenerating.
[00:34:47.404 --> 00:34:48.084]  Look at the crime.
[00:34:48.104 --> 00:34:48.644]  Look at the evil.
[00:34:48.865 --> 00:34:50.826]  If any of you have children, why would you do that?
[00:34:50.946 --> 00:34:51.826]  Why would you do this?
[00:34:54.447 --> 00:35:04.132]  You're being used by the globalists in a much larger plan, and when the New World Order talks about 80-90% of the population of the Earth, do you have any idea what that process is going to look like?
[00:35:04.312 --> 00:35:05.013]  I have a very good idea.
[00:35:06.314 --> 00:35:07.696]  I've been forecasting it for decades.
[00:35:08.538 --> 00:35:13.366]  Almost none of you are going to live that serve this, and those that do live are going to wish you were dead.
[00:35:15.269 --> 00:35:22.095]  I'm just here saying this way is destruction, this way is nuclear war, this way is total collapse, this way is impoverishment and pain.
[00:35:22.676 --> 00:35:25.779]  The globalists on top want to get rid of this civilization and they're willing to do it.
[00:35:26.219 --> 00:35:29.442]  And they believe they're going to protect themselves in the process, but they know they're still gambling.
[00:35:29.922 --> 00:35:43.861]   But for those of you that don't have tens of billions of dollars and secret armored redoubts 500 miles from any town, And underground warehouses of gold, stockpiles of medicine, which believe me, the rulers do have.
[00:35:44.201 --> 00:35:46.201]  You are crazy!
[00:35:46.201 --> 00:35:54.701]  Wednesday live World War 3 alert.
[00:35:55.148 --> 00:35:59.771]  Ukrainian dictator Zelensky visits Washington, demands hundreds of billions of dollars in support for nuclear war.
[00:36:01.554 --> 00:36:07.798]  And he fired missiles into Poland a month ago and said the Russians did it and demanded nuclear strikes on Russia, hoping we would just pull the trigger.
[00:36:07.938 --> 00:36:09.098]  I mean, what is he thinking?
[00:36:10.919 --> 00:36:13.341]  Well, I mean, he's a gay porn star.
[00:36:14.621 --> 00:36:15.542]  What do you think he's thinking?
[00:36:16.362 --> 00:36:17.063]  Not thinking much.
[00:36:19.975 --> 00:36:22.297]  So, he's totally compromised.
[00:36:22.417 --> 00:36:28.401]  You gotta ask, who are the forces behind Zelensky that behave like this and that act like this and that are doing this?
[00:36:28.961 --> 00:36:29.581]  They're nihilists.
[00:36:29.601 --> 00:36:30.662]  They're flirting with destruction.
[00:36:30.982 --> 00:36:33.104]  They're demonically inclined.
[00:36:34.404 --> 00:36:35.685]  Now, we got a ton of calls here.
[00:36:35.725 --> 00:36:36.446]  Loaded phone lines.
[00:36:36.506 --> 00:36:42.690]  Russell, Tom, Ron, Jay, Al Killer, Adrian, Justin, Josh, Stan, Henry, Ed.
[00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:44.651]  First-time callers, long-time callers.
[00:36:44.771 --> 00:36:47.013]  Everybody is here today.
[00:36:47.153 --> 00:36:47.533]  Welcome.
[00:36:49.352 --> 00:36:51.357]  And we're going to go over all these big topics with you.
[00:36:51.377 --> 00:36:53.401]  And I have some incredible clips we're going to get to.
[00:36:53.421 --> 00:36:55.526]  In fact, I'm going to get to one of Dr. Michael Yidan.
[00:36:57.106 --> 00:37:02.591]  The former chief scientist at Pfizer who retired one year before they released COVID, listen to what he says here in a moment.
[00:37:03.452 --> 00:37:08.376]  He says, I've not been a Christian and I didn't believe in God or religion, but basically now I do.
[00:37:09.276 --> 00:37:16.643]  There is a demonic intelligence to this and this is satanic and the people doing it are destroying themselves in the process.
[00:37:16.803 --> 00:37:17.583]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:17.984 --> 00:37:18.404]  He's got it.
[00:37:18.664 --> 00:37:19.385]  Guy's got like 170 IQ on record.
[00:37:19.205 --> 00:37:25.945]  170 IQ on record. He's going, "I believe in God now."
[00:37:25.945 --> 00:37:30.935]   Because he sees elites doing things that hurt themselves as well to kill people and the
[00:37:30.935 --> 00:37:35.365]   total control and evil and what it's all about.
[00:37:33.518 --> 00:37:35.320]  He's now gotten to the realization it's satanic.
[00:37:36.852 --> 00:37:37.632]  That's coming up in a moment.
[00:37:37.652 --> 00:37:39.794]  But first, I want to thank the listeners.
[00:37:40.014 --> 00:37:43.176]  I've sent out the bat signal many times, but we are maxed out.
[00:37:43.796 --> 00:37:45.958]  Our legal bills are going down because we're on appeal.
[00:37:46.318 --> 00:37:47.218]  I'm in bankruptcy.
[00:37:47.278 --> 00:37:48.639]  It's Chapter 11, Subchapter 5.
[00:37:48.819 --> 00:37:49.840]  It's a reorganization.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:59.406]  As long as we can be solvent and somewhat profitable, then the money will go to run this operation, keep us on the air for years while the appeals go forward.
[00:37:59.966 --> 00:38:03.389]  The only way we can be taken off the air is if you don't support the broadcast.
[00:38:04.423 --> 00:38:07.505]  And if you don't buy great products that you already need, so it's a win-win.
[00:38:07.565 --> 00:38:11.868]  Just make the decision, and I thank you, to go to infowarshaw.com and get products you need.
[00:38:12.328 --> 00:38:13.409]  Take Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:18.072]  More of this is not coming in until February at the earliest.
[00:38:18.472 --> 00:38:27.018]  It's all the best vitamins, all the key minerals, all the key amino acids, everything you need in one scoop, put it in the water, put it in the refrigerator, drink it in the morning, night, whatever, tastes great.
[00:38:28.604 --> 00:38:29.585]  And it's everything you need.
[00:38:29.725 --> 00:38:30.486]  So many problems.
[00:38:30.566 --> 00:38:32.607]  Most of the problems are a deficiency or one or the other.
[00:38:32.908 --> 00:38:33.708]  This is what you need.
[00:38:34.169 --> 00:38:38.472]  Despite the fact it's going to sell out in the next couple weeks, maybe even sooner, 50% off.
[00:38:38.532 --> 00:38:39.213]  I want you to have it.
[00:38:39.253 --> 00:38:43.977]  And I want to incentivize those of you on the fence to become InfoWars customers at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:38:44.237 --> 00:38:45.078]  Sign up for auto shipping.
[00:38:45.098 --> 00:38:49.942]  They hold one back for you and you get double Patriot points as well and 10% off on the next order.
[00:38:51.590 --> 00:38:57.092]  Now people are really excited about this, and this is pulling us out of the red into the black here very soon.
[00:38:57.132 --> 00:38:57.912]  So thank all of you.
[00:38:57.952 --> 00:39:00.073]  Remember how great Red Pill Plus is?
[00:39:00.093 --> 00:39:09.816]  I don't have 10 minutes for everything that's in it, but it has preglanone, the precursor that your body produces naturally that helps your body, you've got to have it, create all your other hormones.
[00:39:10.556 --> 00:39:15.618]  So stamina, libido, energy, so many people are missing preglanone, especially those 40 or older.
[00:39:16.258 --> 00:39:27.649]  It has a good dose of the highest quality preglanone in it, and then it's got all these other key trace elements in it that so many people are missing that work as cofactors with regular minerals and vitamins.
[00:39:27.689 --> 00:39:28.990]  And then it's got a bunch of other things.
[00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:30.812]  It would take five minutes to read all the ingredients.
[00:39:31.172 --> 00:39:32.493]  This is really a game changer.
[00:39:32.793 --> 00:39:33.674]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[00:39:34.075 --> 00:39:36.717]  Back in stock after two years being sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:39:37.117 --> 00:39:41.722]  It is 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:39:43.874 --> 00:39:50.223]  Then there's the new InfoWars MD line that we can only discount 25% off because there's not much markup in it.
[00:39:50.963 --> 00:39:54.523]   These are clones of already best-selling products around the country from a top supplement maker,
[00:39:54.523 --> 00:39:58.903]   but listeners that are letting us private label it and put our name on it,
[00:39:58.903 --> 00:40:01.923]   and they ship it out of their facility so you get it even quicker,
[00:40:01.923 --> 00:40:04.882]   and they're not shipping it to us and then having to add that cost in.
[00:40:04.882 --> 00:40:10.244]   That's how we're able to do free shipping again at infowarestore.com on orders $3 or more.
[00:40:10.244 --> 00:40:11.923]  The regular shipping costs have been cut in half.
[00:40:11.923 --> 00:40:16.724]   So a lot of big changes, a lot of innovations at infowarestore.com, like the Tumeric 95,
[00:40:16.724 --> 00:40:22.266]   it's the same formula as bodies, Tumeric95, Infowarsstore.com, Nitric Boost.
[00:40:22.666 --> 00:40:25.007]  Everybody should be taking it for your heart and lungs and cardiovascular.
[00:40:25.747 --> 00:40:28.668]  They're about to sell out of the super high quality CBD at about half the price.
[00:40:29.028 --> 00:40:32.369]  Other great CBDs that are amazing for pain and joint pain and more.
[00:40:32.649 --> 00:40:33.209]  We've got all that.
[00:40:33.390 --> 00:40:34.790]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:37.371]  Check out the Infowars MD line.
[00:40:38.231 --> 00:40:42.634]  And a whole other pharmaceutical maker that also makes top line supplements has three number one bestsellers.
[00:40:42.954 --> 00:40:43.935]  I said, what are your bestsellers?
[00:40:44.295 --> 00:40:52.900]  They said, our top three are these, and you can private label them and sell them for up to 50% off, but they're sold in stores under the Infowars platinum name.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.982]  1776 testosterone boost is the name I gave.
[00:40:56.002 --> 00:40:58.684]  They're already number one bestselling testosterone booster in the country.
[00:40:58.704 --> 00:40:59.665]  We private labeled.
[00:41:00.305 --> 00:41:05.143]   ACH Max Boost and Pain MD all 50% off out of the gates.
[00:41:05.624 --> 00:41:09.869]  MFoil Wars Platinum Brand at MFoilWarsStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:41:09.909 --> 00:41:15.515]  We're a few minutes to break so I can't get to Dr. Michael Yeenon yet.
[00:41:15.555 --> 00:41:17.377]  We'll go to break, come back, play it.
[00:41:18.971 --> 00:41:21.152]  And then I'm going to go to your phone calls and so much more.
[00:41:21.192 --> 00:41:22.573]  But wait to hear what Sean Penn said.
[00:41:23.553 --> 00:41:24.454]  This isn't all the leftists.
[00:41:24.474 --> 00:41:28.476]  A year ago, two years ago, sitting arresting unvaccinated, he said this yesterday.
[00:41:28.956 --> 00:41:30.077]  I've had dinner with Sean Penn.
[00:41:30.097 --> 00:41:30.837]  I know Sean Penn.
[00:41:31.217 --> 00:41:32.318]  You can't blame Sean Penn.
[00:41:32.718 --> 00:41:34.639]  He is literally an empty suit.
[00:41:34.979 --> 00:41:38.321]  The man has probably a 75 IQ.
[00:41:39.202 --> 00:41:41.603]  But people think he's smart because he pauses and talks slow.
[00:41:43.398 --> 00:41:45.557]  Like if you wear glasses, somebody thinks you're smarter.
[00:41:45.557 --> 00:41:47.856]  I mean, the man is a puppet.
[00:41:47.856 --> 00:41:49.678]  The man is a meat sock.
[00:41:49.678 --> 00:41:53.478]  The man is a meat marionette.
[00:41:53.478 --> 00:41:58.718]  And he's one of the stupidest people I've ever been around.
[00:41:58.718 --> 00:42:02.518]   You ever taken out a super gorgeous woman, but she's so stupid, you just drop her off
[00:42:02.518 --> 00:42:03.518]  at home?
[00:42:03.518 --> 00:42:06.198]  There's just nothing grosser, folks, than her.
[00:42:06.198 --> 00:42:08.398]  And then you get one of these leftist men that is so dumb.
[00:42:08.398 --> 00:42:12.757]   I mean, you just feel like an idiot even being in their presence.
[00:42:12.757 --> 00:42:17.117]  Sean Penn is the epitome of Hollywood.
[00:42:18.041 --> 00:42:30.048]  And then to see somebody like Tom Cruise, who's been right about drugging the kids and so much more, have people thrown off his set that aren't vaccinated with the poison, aren't wearing masks, frothing and groveling to Zelensky, it's disgusting.
[00:42:30.308 --> 00:42:38.133]  These people are fakes, and they're frauds, and they're anathema, and they're soulless, and we should have nothing to do with any of them.
[00:42:39.134 --> 00:42:44.037]  So burn in hell... Sean Penn, you...
[00:42:44.968 --> 00:42:50.807]   Mental dwarf. All right our number two with your calls and so much more is straight ahead

[00:42:54.848 --> 00:42:58.608]   It's literally the equivalent of punching the new world order politically non-violent in the nose

[00:43:17.348 --> 00:43:29.455]   provider read the literature and be careful Because the recommended dose on these, especially the HTH boost, especially the testosterone boost, is more than I can handle.
[00:43:30.424 --> 00:43:32.504]  And I've had a lot of friends and family take it as well.
[00:43:32.824 --> 00:43:46.167]  They've never had such results, but they're also like, man, you better tell folks to be careful with that, especially the HGH boost and what it does when you take it at night and you go to sleep, the deep sleep, and what it does to your cells, how it reboots your body.
[00:43:46.687 --> 00:43:56.309]  So InfoWars Platinum is exclusive private label at 40% off what it is in stores of three already bestsellers at InfoWarsStore.com.

[00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:05.431]  And it works great for women as well, but these two formulas are tailored to women.
[00:44:05.751 --> 00:44:08.853]  The HGH Boost and the 1776 testosterone boost.
[00:44:09.193 --> 00:44:11.053]  And of course, the Pain MD is for everybody.
[00:44:11.374 --> 00:44:12.594]  They are really amazing.
[00:44:12.894 --> 00:44:13.955]  We're very, very proud of them.
[00:44:14.275 --> 00:44:22.518]  And I want to encourage you all to go to InfoWarsaw.com and experience the powerful compounds that God has given us in the environment.
[00:44:23.078 --> 00:44:34.162]  to be able to counteract all the different things they're bombarding us with that really try to separate us from the bodies and the chemicals and the natural things that God gave us.
[00:44:34.822 --> 00:44:42.446]   This stuff is the cavalry when it comes to countering the new world All right, I want all the stations to hear your calls.
[00:44:42.486 --> 00:44:46.212]  So in six minutes, I'm going right to your calls and I'll cover the big COVID news.
[00:44:46.252 --> 00:44:47.614]  But first, I want to replay this report.
[00:44:47.634 --> 00:44:48.376]  It's so important.
[00:44:49.017 --> 00:44:51.882]  On the eve of the Cashless Society from Gregg Reese.
[00:44:52.262 --> 00:44:53.144]  This is so vital.
[00:44:52.984 --> 00:44:59.984]  here it is. A key component of human life is enlightenment.
[00:45:00.984 --> 00:45:04.984]  A key component of human life is enlightenment.
[00:45:05.304 --> 00:45:09.926]  The awakening from the darkness of deception into the light of truth.
[00:45:10.487 --> 00:45:14.669]  The so-called Great Awakening has really been going on forever.
[00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:22.572]  And before MAGA and QAnon, the consensus was that the banks were at the top of the criminal pyramid structure.
[00:45:22.993 --> 00:45:33.601]   And while many of us assumed that a hidden hand was pulling their strings as well, We realized that their main goal was a digital currency and a cashless society.
[00:45:34.102 --> 00:45:36.404]  It was the subject of several documentaries.
[00:45:36.444 --> 00:45:46.295]  The ultimate goal that these people have in mind is the goal to create a one world government run by the banking industry, run by the bankers.
[00:45:47.233 --> 00:45:47.393]  Right?
[00:45:47.433 --> 00:45:48.454]  There'll be no more cash.
[00:45:48.935 --> 00:45:50.777]  And this is getting me straight from Rockefeller himself.
[00:45:50.797 --> 00:45:51.918]  This is what they want to accomplish.
[00:45:52.659 --> 00:45:54.180]  And all money will be in your chips.
[00:45:55.101 --> 00:46:00.487]  And, if you're like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just turn off your chip.
[00:46:01.653 --> 00:46:02.394]  And you have nothing.
[00:46:02.815 --> 00:46:03.816]  You can't buy foods.
[00:46:04.617 --> 00:46:05.539]  You can't do anything.
[00:46:05.639 --> 00:46:06.921]  It's total control of the people.
[00:46:07.001 --> 00:46:10.887]  And that ship's connected to a database that has your purchasing records, what you do, what you sell.
[00:46:11.007 --> 00:46:11.608]  Everything.
[00:46:11.808 --> 00:46:12.769]  Everything is in there.
[00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:17.997]  And it was also commonly discussed that they'll likely use Big Pharma to get us there.
[00:46:18.177 --> 00:46:19.838]  Yes, there have been corrupt empires.
[00:46:19.978 --> 00:46:21.079]  Yes, they manipulate.
[00:46:21.219 --> 00:46:22.880]  Yes, there are secret societies.
[00:46:23.241 --> 00:46:25.342]  Yes, there have been oligarchies throughout history.
[00:46:25.662 --> 00:46:42.395]  And yes, today, in 2002, there is a tyrannical organization calling itself the New World Order, pushing for worldwide government, a cashless society, open borders, total and complete tyranny.
[00:46:43.015 --> 00:46:56.762]  And by creating open borders where there's no national sovereignty and only global bodies that control all the resources, by centralizing and socializing health care, the state becomes God, basically, when it comes to your health.
[00:46:57.122 --> 00:47:04.086]  And then by releasing diseases and viruses and plagues upon us, we then basically get shoved into their system.
[00:47:04.226 --> 00:47:16.557]  But now it's as if everyone has just accepted it and found something else to fight about because the cashless society is being rolled out right now and very few people seem bothered by it.
[00:47:17.378 --> 00:47:28.929]  In November of 2019, right before COVID, the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School had a live tabletop exercise called Digital Currency Wars.
[00:47:29.409 --> 00:47:43.423]  Which looked at how the United States can continue to leverage economic power in a world of national digital currencies, such as the Chinese digital yuan, which is already heavily competing in trade against the U.S.
[00:47:43.463 --> 00:47:48.608]  dollar and seems to be at the forefront of centralized digital currencies.
[00:47:49.229 --> 00:47:50.991]  And it has an expiry date.
[00:47:51.511 --> 00:47:56.615]  If you don't spend it by then, it becomes worthless, so people can no longer save money.
[00:47:57.195 --> 00:48:07.463]  The Bank of International Settlements has announced that the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations, and will have technologies to enforce it.
[00:48:08.143 --> 00:48:14.987]  The Central Bank of Brazil is planning to launch their centralized digital currency in 2024.
[00:48:15.727 --> 00:48:17.508]  Israel is about to launch theirs.
[00:48:18.049 --> 00:48:21.711]  And the Bank of England is now preparing a UK digital currency.
[00:48:22.411 --> 00:48:27.754]  Italy's new Prime Minister, Meloni, is speaking out against the cashless society.
[00:48:28.194 --> 00:48:30.856]  But she seems to stand alone on the world stage.
[00:48:31.716 --> 00:48:39.145]  In the Federal Reserve's digital currency scheme, it appears that Hedera and Quant will be used on the technology side.
[00:48:39.666 --> 00:48:42.008]  They are already connected to everything.
[00:48:42.389 --> 00:48:47.695]  The cashless society is here, but everyone is talking about Hunter Biden's laptop.
[00:48:48.436 --> 00:48:54.079]  The goal was never to put an old senile puppet into the presidency to run havoc.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.081]  The goal was to create a cashless society.
[00:48:57.621 --> 00:49:05.406]  And so while bringing Joe Biden to justice may feel like a victory, the tyrants are still getting exactly what they wanted.
[00:49:05.866 --> 00:49:09.148]  And once it's all said and done, then who will save you?
[00:49:09.629 --> 00:49:15.012]  And if you're like me or you, and you're protesting what they're doing, they can just turn off your chip.
[00:49:16.195 --> 00:49:16.895]  And you have nothing.
[00:49:17.335 --> 00:49:18.336]  You can't buy foods.
[00:49:19.136 --> 00:49:20.096]  You can't do anything.
[00:49:20.196 --> 00:49:22.597]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:49:23.637 --> 00:49:31.860]  And by the way, people say that interview with the Russos from 2009, he actually died in 2007, right after Endgame came out.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.961]  I did that interview with him in 2006.
[00:49:35.941 --> 00:49:38.402]  I salute you all for keeping us on air and everything you do.
[00:49:38.422 --> 00:49:42.603]  That goes to our affiliates, our sponsors, the crew, and our wonderful, beautiful listeners.
[00:49:43.266 --> 00:49:49.911]  All right, I'm going to take phone calls for the next two hours, ladies and gentlemen, then we'll go into the fourth hour covering news and more.
[00:49:50.331 --> 00:49:53.454]  We've got loaded phone lines here, so I'm going to go to your phone calls right now.
[00:49:53.494 --> 00:49:56.056]  Just please make your points so we can get to the next person.
[00:49:56.096 --> 00:49:56.876]  I want to hear from you all.
[00:49:57.277 --> 00:50:00.079]  Tom in Canada on the Ukraine war and the poison shots.
[00:50:00.119 --> 00:50:00.479]  Go ahead.
[00:50:00.499 --> 00:50:03.201]  Hi, Alex.
[00:50:03.601 --> 00:50:09.766]  The first time I heard the term vaccine passport was on your show.
[00:50:10.643 --> 00:50:13.265]  In May 2020, you nailed it.
[00:50:14.065 --> 00:50:15.987]  We must never forget about what happened.
[00:50:16.867 --> 00:50:17.628]  Stay strong.
[00:50:18.048 --> 00:50:20.630]  I drove with the Freedom Convoy in Canada.
[00:50:22.251 --> 00:50:26.794]  And your dictator says you're a criminal and not allowed to protest.
[00:50:28.596 --> 00:50:29.236]  That's correct.
[00:50:29.596 --> 00:50:30.457]  The man's a lunatic.
[00:50:32.352 --> 00:50:34.154]  And for those that don't know, people say, well, how's he a dictator?
[00:50:34.174 --> 00:50:34.654]  He's elected.
[00:50:34.674 --> 00:50:38.397]  He got, what, 30% of the vote, but he manipulates the parliament so he stays in power.
[00:50:38.417 --> 00:50:39.298]  It doesn't matter.
[00:50:39.398 --> 00:50:42.540]  Even if you're elected, if you do dictatorial things, folks, you're a dictator.
[00:50:44.302 --> 00:50:49.866]  He has not won the popular vote since 2015.
[00:50:53.009 --> 00:50:57.012]  What's your view on the Ukraine war and Zelensky coming here demanding more than $48 billion this week?
[00:50:59.074 --> 00:51:04.363]   The USA should cut All funding to that conflict.
[00:51:04.923 --> 00:51:14.327]  Putin should build a demilitarized zone so he can hold the Donbass and end the war.
[00:51:14.147 --> 00:51:19.147]   Well that's what Kissinger says is given those areas are like 98% Russia that's
[00:51:19.147 --> 00:51:22.666]   always a part of Russia and give Putin an exit or this is going to lead to nuclear war.
[00:51:22.666 --> 00:51:29.187]   Anything else sir? Crimea and Donbass belong with Russia but the rest of the
[00:51:29.187 --> 00:51:34.706]  country should stay with Ukraine. Thank you for the call.
[00:51:34.028 --> 00:51:35.109]  By the way, I said $48 billion.
[00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:36.970]  They're offering him $45 billion.
[00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:39.151]  He's demanding $100 billion or more.
[00:51:39.812 --> 00:51:41.272]  Hell, he demanded a trillion a few weeks ago.
[00:51:41.292 --> 00:51:42.273]  The guy's just something else.
[00:51:43.494 --> 00:51:45.255]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jay in Kentucky.
[00:51:45.295 --> 00:51:45.955]  Jay, you're on the air.
[00:51:45.975 --> 00:51:48.337]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:51:48.637 --> 00:51:48.937]  Hey, brother.
[00:51:50.238 --> 00:52:10.178]   You're very eloquent with your words, and I appreciate you, and I'm a not very conservative Jew, and I go to a synagogue, and a lot of the People I share links with, their eyes are opening up to the point that I'm getting messages back from people.
[00:52:10.198 --> 00:52:22.464]  I sent that link about Fauci and I sent the link, Fauci criminal crimes, and I sent the link to the Rumble thing suddenly died.
[00:52:22.484 --> 00:52:32.926]   And these people, you know, I'm actually witnessing what's going on with People losing babies and having to have special operations to try to conceive.
[00:52:32.986 --> 00:52:40.393]  Well, that was my point with Ye, when he was going off on the ridiculous Hitler thing, was, hey, you know, Israel's being hit harder than anybody with these poison shots.
[00:52:40.774 --> 00:52:44.938]  If the Jews run everything, why didn't they get the message to not take the shots?
[00:52:45.018 --> 00:52:54.406]   People are people, and the globalists are a consortium of evil groups that are all vying for power, and we all, whether we're Christian or Muslim or Jewish, Yeah, definitely.
[00:52:54.426 --> 00:52:58.508]  The propaganda was strong, but now you can't not see what's going on with even my rabbi that I love.
[00:52:58.327 --> 00:53:02.007]   for a pro-human future when I'm getting from you is you think a lot of Jews you
[00:53:02.007 --> 00:53:06.007]   know that are I guess you're saying conservative at least or Orthodox or
[00:53:06.007 --> 00:53:09.686]   maybe they're not Orthodox they're really starting to wake up? Yeah
[00:53:09.686 --> 00:53:15.807]   definitely the propaganda was strong but now you can't you can't not see what's
[00:53:15.807 --> 00:53:22.248]   going on with even my rabbi that I love he he got the shot the COVID shot there
[00:53:22.248 --> 00:53:30.220]   and he was you know and he was sick with COVID And we had a little discussion and I said, I really wish you didn't get that shot.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.280]  And he said, me too.
[00:53:31.981 --> 00:53:34.682]  But it's a little late now, but you know, these people.
[00:53:34.722 --> 00:53:41.525]  You know, it was Dr. Zelenko, Dr. Zelenko that came from a long rabbinical family, but became a doctor himself.
[00:53:41.865 --> 00:53:43.585]  That was one of the main leaders warning everybody.
[00:53:43.625 --> 00:53:44.826]  So folks should really listen to him.
[00:53:46.066 --> 00:53:47.827]  Yeah, I miss Zelenko.
[00:53:48.187 --> 00:53:59.681]   And I liked the one thing that I liked a lot that he said, but the one thing that I really liked is Whether you're waiting for the Messiah to come for the first time or the second time, we need a Messiah right now.
[00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:00.422]  We do.
[00:54:00.522 --> 00:54:03.665]  I'll cut you loose.
[00:54:03.745 --> 00:54:05.487]  I really do appreciate you and your program.
[00:54:05.527 --> 00:54:05.867]  Thank you, sir.
[00:54:05.887 --> 00:54:06.768]  Well, God bless you, Jay.
[00:54:06.788 --> 00:54:07.369]  Good news, folks.
[00:54:07.389 --> 00:54:07.849]  You're waking up.
[00:54:07.889 --> 00:54:08.129]  Thank you.
[00:54:08.149 --> 00:54:08.770]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:54:09.431 --> 00:54:12.153]  Hell, even all these big Hollywood stars are coming out and apologizing.
[00:54:12.173 --> 00:54:13.335]  I went to get to that clip yesterday.
[00:54:14.155 --> 00:54:14.716]  What's the guy?
[00:54:14.756 --> 00:54:16.278]  He's an actor from Shawshank Redemption.
[00:54:18.501 --> 00:54:26.186]  He's a good actor, but he's always saying, Tim Robbins, he's always saying stupid liberal stuff, but more and more, he's coming out and saying, no, no, we're wrong, this is wrong.
[00:54:26.587 --> 00:54:29.429]  So a lot of these liberals mean well, folks, they just don't know.
[00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:31.250]  We can wake them up.
[00:54:32.531 --> 00:54:33.992]  And you're going to see whether they're going to wake up or not.
[00:54:34.012 --> 00:54:37.735]  I mean, take, I mean, there's so many examples of this.
[00:54:38.416 --> 00:54:39.516]  So many examples of this.
[00:54:40.717 --> 00:54:42.318]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ron in Arizona.
[00:54:42.379 --> 00:54:43.780]  Ron, let's talk about the open border.
[00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:44.120]  Go ahead.
[00:54:45.936 --> 00:54:47.056]  Good morning, Alex Jones.
[00:54:47.076 --> 00:54:47.976]  Great to talk to you, sir.
[00:54:48.016 --> 00:54:48.396]  Yes, sir.
[00:54:48.436 --> 00:55:08.640]  You know, I got up this morning, I put on my system, and it says where our great McConnell says, oh, the Ukraine war is the greatest challenge or, you know, the greatest thing that's facing the United States, but... And he went on to lie and say that Republicans overall, it's the number one issue for them.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.200]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:14.321]  And last night, I went to an all-night gas station.
[00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:18.973]  Here in Phoenix, where I live, close to the interstate, the north-south interstate.
[00:55:20.334 --> 00:55:29.060]  And it was about two in the morning, and I go into the store, and it's a national chain of gas stations, and they have a restroom inside.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.684]  And there's ten men in line, okay, across the coffee machines, up to the men's room.
[00:55:36.825 --> 00:55:44.931]  And I noticed they're all about the same age, same size, everything, and one of them comes out of the men's restroom, and another one goes in.
[00:55:46.556 --> 00:55:47.679]  And I said, what the heck's going on?
[00:55:47.779 --> 00:55:50.645]  And I get to the front of the line and I just open the door and I look.
[00:55:51.808 --> 00:55:54.714]  And none of these men realize there's multiple urinals.
[00:55:55.957 --> 00:55:56.899]  Multiple stalls.
[00:55:58.291 --> 00:55:59.412]  In this gas station.
[00:55:59.572 --> 00:56:01.973]  They've never seen... Let me tell folks where you're going.
[00:56:02.053 --> 00:56:04.014]  I showed this about five years ago.
[00:56:04.475 --> 00:56:06.636]  They're at the truck stops on I-35.
[00:56:06.676 --> 00:56:07.777]  Almost all of them have this.
[00:56:08.477 --> 00:56:11.619]  It tells you in Spanish, put your toilet paper in the toilet.
[00:56:12.159 --> 00:56:15.461]  And so a lot of these guys crap in the corner or piss in the corner.
[00:56:15.881 --> 00:56:23.406]  And I'm not putting them down, but these are literally farm boys from Central and South America that have never even been in a bathroom.
[00:56:24.286 --> 00:56:25.967]  And they think you crap on the floor.
[00:56:25.987 --> 00:56:29.729]  I mean, can you imagine how the globalists... I'm sorry, I'm stealing your thunder.
[00:56:29.769 --> 00:56:30.849]  Tell the rest of the story.
[00:56:30.869 --> 00:56:31.449]  No, that's okay.
[00:56:31.509 --> 00:56:32.790]  No, I didn't realize that.
[00:56:32.810 --> 00:56:33.970]  Because they were polite.
[00:56:34.371 --> 00:56:36.892]  You know, when I walked by them, they put their heads down, you know.
[00:56:37.412 --> 00:56:42.134]  It's not like they were, you know, trying to make a problem, but they were trying to stay out of the way.
[00:56:42.794 --> 00:56:43.655]  So I'm curious.
[00:56:43.795 --> 00:56:44.595]  I'm an info warrior.
[00:56:44.635 --> 00:56:45.096]  I'm waiting.
[00:56:45.216 --> 00:56:48.557]  And they all come out, and they all pile into these white vans.
[00:56:48.617 --> 00:56:52.059]  There was two white vans, identical, with Utah plates.
[00:56:52.419 --> 00:56:52.519]  Yep.
[00:56:53.479 --> 00:56:55.461]  You know, and I'm like, what am I supposed to do?
[00:56:55.481 --> 00:56:58.805]  You know, I'm not the type to strap on and I'm not going to, you know, make an issue of a fight.
[00:56:58.625 --> 00:57:02.144]   They get people there, then they sign them up for welfare, then they skim the money off
[00:57:02.144 --> 00:57:03.144]  the top.
[00:57:03.144 --> 00:57:08.304]  You know, and I'm like, what am I supposed to do?
[00:57:08.304 --> 00:57:11.864]   You know, I'm not the type to strap on and I'm not going to, you know, make an issue
[00:57:11.864 --> 00:57:12.864]  of fighting that.
[00:57:12.864 --> 00:57:16.304]  And if I tell anybody this, they think I'm crazy.
[00:57:16.304 --> 00:57:20.224]   And you know, it's all you got to do is step out of your house here in Arizona.
[00:57:20.199 --> 00:57:21.739]  We got a war, it's not a war.
[00:57:21.759 --> 00:57:22.820]  Brother, you ain't got to tell me.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:23.640]  I've been to the border.
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:26.120]  It is crazy town.
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:27.241]  20,000 a day now.
[00:57:27.301 --> 00:57:28.721]  It was 14,000 a day before.
[00:57:28.741 --> 00:57:31.082]  20,000 a day in El Paso alone.
[00:57:31.102 --> 00:57:32.862]  I mean, it is crazy.
[00:57:34.102 --> 00:57:36.823]  Yeah, and then put on National Newsday and say, well, you haven't seen anything yet.
[00:57:36.983 --> 00:57:37.803]  Wait till 42.
[00:57:37.923 --> 00:57:39.744]  And I'm like, I haven't seen anything yet.
[00:57:41.324 --> 00:57:45.525]  Well, just imagine where these people come from that they don't know what a toilet's for.
[00:57:49.786 --> 00:57:59.810]   And the exposure to our population, you know, the pristine nature of what the United States used to be as being Well, here's the deal.
[00:58:00.030 --> 00:58:00.711]  I totally agree.
[00:58:00.751 --> 00:58:04.734]  Central and South America are something like 80% rural.
[00:58:05.314 --> 00:58:11.899]  And so these folks grow up on farms, they work, they produce the food that everybody eats, and then they did two years of lockdowns, they no longer have jobs.
[00:58:11.919 --> 00:58:14.762]  They did a big survey earlier this year and they asked, why are you coming?
[00:58:14.782 --> 00:58:18.385]  97% said, because they won't let me work, I'm starving to death.
[00:58:18.905 --> 00:58:24.529]  So it's not their fault, they're having the UN lockdowns that went for two years in their countries, and they're being told, come here.
[00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:27.091]  And they don't even know how to use a toilet.
[00:58:27.111 --> 00:58:27.672]  Anything else, Ron?
[00:58:28.869 --> 00:58:29.709]  No, that's it, sir.
[00:58:29.729 --> 00:58:30.850]  You nailed it.
[00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:32.671]  I'm so happy you're on the radio.
[00:58:33.471 --> 00:58:34.312]  Hang in there, my man.
[00:58:34.472 --> 00:58:34.752]  Good luck.
[00:58:34.932 --> 00:58:35.432]  I'm trying.
[00:58:36.112 --> 00:58:36.993]  It's all up to you guys.
[00:58:37.033 --> 00:58:37.753]  I'm not putting it on you.
[00:58:37.773 --> 00:58:38.313]  I'm not bitching.
[00:58:38.874 --> 00:58:40.955]  If you want to take me out of the game, folks, don't buy the products.
[00:58:40.975 --> 00:58:41.615]  Don't spread the word.
[00:58:42.175 --> 00:58:43.476]  Because it's neck and neck.
[00:58:43.496 --> 00:58:44.696]  We've never been more influential.
[00:58:44.716 --> 00:58:48.718]  But at the same time, the economy and everything going on, people are like, well, you're bankrupt.
[00:58:48.758 --> 00:58:50.139]  I mean, billion dollar judgment.
[00:58:50.159 --> 00:58:50.739]  You're going away.
[00:58:50.759 --> 00:58:51.239]  No, we're not.
[00:58:51.259 --> 00:58:52.200]  We're appealing it for two years.
[00:58:54.189 --> 00:58:58.108]   Somebody has to worry about products you buy from us going to the left or any of this crap.
[00:58:58.108 --> 00:59:02.028]   We're in bankruptcy to reorganize and we have two years of appeals.
[00:59:02.028 --> 00:59:08.519]   So, uh, that's what's bittersweet about this because I have almost no money. So they're getting all this money. It just
[00:59:08.519 --> 00:59:11.228]   doesn't exist We'll be right back with your call. Stay with us
[00:59:11.228 --> 00:59:15.708]   Foreign Is
[00:59:15.708 --> 00:59:20.269]   Foreign Foreign
[00:59:20.269 --> 00:59:30.268]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:27.183]  So guys, a mother has left her kids behind here.
[00:59:27.202 --> 00:59:33.202]  Wow. So guys, a mother has left her kids behind here.
[00:59:33.202 --> 00:59:58.202]  [Spanish]
[00:59:58.202 --> 01:00:03.003]   Alright guys, I'm gonna start walking with what is a caravan now.
[01:00:03.039 --> 01:00:05.201]  So this is mothers leaving their children behind.
[01:00:05.221 --> 01:00:06.821]  We have a quarter mile.
[01:00:06.861 --> 01:00:09.643]  And then shows up to 20,000 people with barbed wire.
[01:00:09.663 --> 01:00:11.143]  They just opened the barbed wire and let them in.
[01:00:11.984 --> 01:00:26.014]   This is a humanitarian disaster the left has caused by Biden telling The Democrats to go out and promote everywhere and telling the illegals immediately rush the border and you'll be let into the country.
[01:00:26.554 --> 01:00:30.316]  I want to go back to your calls but it's important to document this here on air on radio and TV.
[01:00:31.256 --> 01:00:32.096]  Let's go to these clips.
[01:00:32.636 --> 01:00:46.923]   Here's an MSNBC reporter says she spoke to illegal immigrants who told her they haven't had any interaction with US immigration authorities but again There is no border crisis, and if there is a border crisis, it's the Republicans' fault, and the Republicans told them to come here.
[01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:49.886]  ABC News and CNN and the White House have told us.
[01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.687]  I mean, this is beyond gaslighting.
[01:00:52.027 --> 01:00:56.170]  But they've just normalized this level of lying, and the media doesn't call them out.
[01:00:56.289 --> 01:00:57.250]  Here's a clip.
[01:00:57.250 --> 01:01:00.969]   We were even able to see as of last night, a lot of migrants just crossing
[01:01:00.969 --> 01:01:04.529]   and migrants I spoke to this morning saying they haven't had any interaction
[01:01:04.529 --> 01:01:06.009]  with US immigration authorities.
[01:01:06.009 --> 01:01:07.489]  They just walked right in.
[01:01:07.489 --> 01:01:11.250]   Really what we're seeing here is a city that is overwhelmed and in chaos.
[01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.989]   These families behind me here, these are some of the lucky ones.
[01:01:13.989 --> 01:01:17.128]   We're inside a shelter, but a lot of shelters are overwhelmed.
[01:01:17.128 --> 01:01:18.969]  I just came from the streets this morning.
[01:01:18.969 --> 01:01:23.210]   There were hundreds of people sleeping in the airports, at bus stations, on the streets,
[01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:24.929]  and it's actually really cold here.
[01:01:24.956 --> 01:01:27.057]  It was 33 degrees when we woke up this morning.
[01:01:27.417 --> 01:01:36.262]  Migrants were huddling together under blankets for warmth because even though Title 42 hasn't lifted yet, so many people have been able to come across.
[01:01:36.382 --> 01:01:41.185]  Not every nationality gets expelled, but we just spoke to people at this shelter here.
[01:01:42.005 --> 01:01:44.507]  Yeah, more funding so they can even flood the border even more.
[01:01:44.527 --> 01:01:45.207]  That's how it works.
[01:01:45.227 --> 01:01:48.950]  They flooded Europe's border the last 10 years, then demand more spending to bring even more in.
[01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:50.031]  That's what Biden said.
[01:01:50.051 --> 01:01:52.232]  Hey, let the Republicans pass a law giving us unlimited money.
[01:01:52.052 --> 01:01:54.052]  will have to do more.
[01:01:54.052 --> 01:01:57.052]   Yeah, more funding so they can even flood the border even more.
[01:01:57.052 --> 01:01:58.052]  That's how it works.
[01:01:58.052 --> 01:02:03.052]   They flooded Europe's border the last 10 years, then demand more spending to bring even more in.
[01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:05.052]  That's what Biden said.
[01:02:05.052 --> 01:02:08.052]   Hey, let the Republicans pass a law giving us unlimited money.
[01:02:08.052 --> 01:02:12.052]   We'll fix the crisis by getting more funding to bring even more in.
[01:02:12.052 --> 01:02:15.052]   Here's Fox News fact checks the Biden administration for claiming
[01:02:15.052 --> 01:02:18.052]  they're not in favor of repealing Title V.
[01:02:17.858 --> 01:02:21.262]  So you've been hearing how we gotta get rid of it, it's the worst thing ever.
[01:02:21.642 --> 01:02:24.345]  Suddenly on a dime, they're not for repealing Title 42.
[01:02:24.385 --> 01:02:25.246]  Here it is.
[01:02:25.887 --> 01:02:32.054]  They've also been distancing themselves from this push the White House has to even end Title 42 in the first place.
[01:02:32.094 --> 01:02:32.535]  Listen to this.
[01:02:33.922 --> 01:02:40.624]  That is a court order that is telling us to lift Title 42, and we're going to comply because we follow the rule of law.
[01:02:40.864 --> 01:02:42.764]  But the administration sought to lift it.
[01:02:43.244 --> 01:02:44.825]  But it is a court order.
[01:02:44.965 --> 01:02:46.385]  It was started by you guys.
[01:02:46.485 --> 01:02:49.686]  It was a court order that has been provided to us.
[01:02:49.706 --> 01:02:52.807]  The president made clear who wanted it back in April.
[01:02:52.827 --> 01:02:56.047]  I can give you a straight answer.
[01:02:56.248 --> 01:03:01.509]  We had proposed to eliminate that policy by the end of May.
[01:03:02.714 --> 01:03:10.320]  And when the courts have previously blocked the administration's push, the press secretary said the administration disagrees with the court's ruling.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:17.926]  So, this current court action means that there is a chance that Title 42 stays in place either for the short term or indefinitely.
[01:03:17.966 --> 01:03:22.149]  The White House, as we said, is moving forward as though this is going to lift.
[01:03:22.449 --> 01:03:28.971]  But according to them, it is the courts that want to lift Title 42, it is Republicans standing in the way of securing the border.
[01:03:29.031 --> 01:03:41.353]  What the President has done on this issue so far has been a success, even though under the President's leadership, illegal crossings have hit all-time highs, and anyone who suggests that the border is open is just spreading misinformation for the smugglers, Harris.
[01:03:43.014 --> 01:03:43.554]  That's right.
[01:03:44.274 --> 01:03:47.755]  Remember, Biden said, if I get elected, immediately surge the border.
[01:03:48.991 --> 01:03:58.839]  And then they went and filed cases to get rid of 42 and had Democrat appointed judges by Obama and others say it's illegal.
[01:04:00.261 --> 01:04:02.723]  Think about how dumb they think we are.
[01:04:02.783 --> 01:04:04.364]  But we're not dumb.
[01:04:04.404 --> 01:04:05.305]  They're just training us.
[01:04:05.345 --> 01:04:06.085]  They lie to us.
[01:04:06.686 --> 01:04:07.587]  They don't get in trouble.
[01:04:08.708 --> 01:04:11.190]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of Biden saying surge the border.
[01:04:12.079 --> 01:04:13.980]  All right, so I wanted to play some of those clips.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:18.380]   What I would do as president is several more things, because things have changed.
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:23.380]   I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:25.380]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:26.440]  They deserve to be heard.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:27.559]  That's who we are.
[01:04:27.559 --> 01:04:32.679]   We're a nation that says if you wanna flee, and you're fleeing oppression, you should come.
[01:04:32.679 --> 01:04:34.880]  So I wanted to play some of those clips.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:41.360]   Guys, you showed me a clip during a break earlier, in El Paso last night,
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:45.720]   where it shows tens of thousands, and then they just open the barbed wire and just let them
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.199]  all in.
[01:04:46.026 --> 01:04:50.388]  I mean, we got plenty of footage of that in the past, but this is currently going on.
[01:04:50.808 --> 01:05:00.631]  Trump completely stopped this, shipped back everybody, and the Democrats now say the Republicans are the ones doing this.
[01:05:00.711 --> 01:05:05.733]  I mean, the footage coming out, it's all on InfoWars.com, the footage coming out is just spectacular.
[01:05:06.173 --> 01:05:17.890]   We got two long segments coming up, so I'm gonna go to Al Killer, and Adrian, and Justin, and Josh, and Stan, and Henry, and Ed, and Russell, and Jordan, everybody else on the other side.
[01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:20.132]  And we're going to be covering a whole bunch of other issues as well.
[01:05:20.152 --> 01:05:25.116]  I also haven't gotten to Dr. Mike Yedon talking about the vaccines being the work of Satan.
[01:05:25.176 --> 01:05:27.338]  He's the former chief scientist at Pfizer.
[01:05:27.998 --> 01:05:29.499]  Didn't believe in God until now.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.963]  That is coming up as well at the start of the next segment.
[01:05:33.983 --> 01:05:35.364]  But let me just briefly explain this.
[01:05:35.864 --> 01:05:37.886]  We have incredible products, just like our information.
[01:05:39.019 --> 01:05:39.740]  Is game-changing?
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:46.424]  Our products, particularly our supplements, are the very best, highest-rated, key compounds the globalists don't want you to have.
[01:05:47.845 --> 01:05:54.870]  And the real Red Pill Plus, after two years plus of not being available because of supply chain issues, is back.
[01:05:55.571 --> 01:05:57.712]  And it's got so many ingredients you should learn about.
[01:05:57.732 --> 01:05:58.973]  It would take me hours to explain it.
[01:05:59.534 --> 01:06:00.995]  Just look into Preglanone.
[01:06:02.576 --> 01:06:07.960]  The precursor to all hormones in humans that your body produces naturally, but as you get older, you stop producing it.
[01:06:09.389 --> 01:06:26.219]  So anybody over 40 particularly should be taking preglanone, but this has all the trace elements and other minerals and vitamins and other key compounds that are for brain function and joints and your heart and your libido and your energy.
[01:06:26.259 --> 01:06:27.199]  It just does so much.
[01:06:27.239 --> 01:06:30.261]  You'll feel the effects in just a week or so taking Real Red Pill.
[01:06:30.301 --> 01:06:32.482]  I mean, you'll feel some of the ingredients in 30 minutes.
[01:06:32.522 --> 01:06:35.764]  It's got a lot of natural, healthy, quality stimulants in it.
[01:06:37.225 --> 01:06:39.186]  You'll feel the real effects in about a week or so.
[01:06:39.586 --> 01:06:42.268]  Take it every night before you go to bed, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:42.308 --> 01:06:45.029]  It's what I, well not because it has the stimulant in it.
[01:06:45.389 --> 01:06:47.210]  Take it, that was the first red pill you could take at night.
[01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:48.451]  Don't take this before you go to bed.
[01:06:48.791 --> 01:06:50.192]  Take it when you get up in the morning.
[01:06:51.394 --> 01:06:52.876]  And it is incredible.
[01:06:53.257 --> 01:06:55.920]  Real Red Pill Plus, we just added some natural stimulant to it.
[01:06:56.541 --> 01:07:01.368]  But it's Real Red Pill Plus, InfowarsStore.com, 50% off.
[01:07:01.869 --> 01:07:09.998]   We also have the new over-the-top Infowars Platinum line that has Three already best-selling products under a national
[01:07:09.998 --> 01:07:11.798]  pharmaceutical company that makes supplements.
[01:07:11.798 --> 01:07:13.599]  There are already three best sellers in the market.
[01:07:13.599 --> 01:07:20.599]   We were able to private label 7076 testosterone boots, HTH Boost, and Pain MD.
[01:07:20.599 --> 01:07:23.798]   All 50% off out of the gates. They're incredible and they keep us on air.
[01:07:23.798 --> 01:07:25.798]  So please experience them and try them.
[01:07:25.798 --> 01:07:27.599]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:07:27.599 --> 01:07:31.599]   O.N., the Vitamin Refusion is selling out, but it's still 50% off.
[01:07:31.599 --> 01:07:36.599]  Harpoon on the war as we fight.
[01:07:36.599 --> 01:07:38.599]  Look, here's the deal.
[01:07:37.799 --> 01:07:43.023]  You got 20,000 illegal aliens a day hitting the border just in the El Paso area every day.
[01:07:44.264 --> 01:07:50.049]  And it's our Border Patrol and our taxpayers that have to try to process all these people so they don't just starve to death over there.
[01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:54.072]  Now you got cold weather set to hit in the next two days.
[01:07:54.092 --> 01:07:57.475]  In a little less than 48 hours, it's going to be 16 degrees.
[01:07:58.496 --> 01:07:59.617]  Even down in South Texas.
[01:08:00.876 --> 01:08:02.677]  And this is Biden saying, come here.
[01:08:02.737 --> 01:08:03.538]  This is the U.N.
[01:08:03.578 --> 01:08:09.301]  setting up refugee camps and then dumping it on us, knowing we have a good Samaritan attitude.
[01:08:10.682 --> 01:08:12.183]  But there's never going to be an end to this.
[01:08:12.223 --> 01:08:13.104]  This is just the beginning.
[01:08:15.205 --> 01:08:16.566]  This is replacement migration.
[01:08:17.227 --> 01:08:17.707]  The U.N.
[01:08:17.747 --> 01:08:25.812]  said 10 years ago they want 640 something million illegal aliens brought into the U.S.
[01:08:25.872 --> 01:08:26.913]  alone and it's game over.
[01:08:28.126 --> 01:08:35.432]  No education, no background, no nothing, don't know what toilets are, they're gonna be brainwashed, and they're gonna do what the communists tell them, and it's game over.
[01:08:35.512 --> 01:08:36.473]  End of our free society.
[01:08:38.074 --> 01:08:40.236]  But that's what happens to all great civilizations.
[01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:42.277]  They forget who they are, they give it up, and they die.
[01:08:42.297 --> 01:08:49.543]  We got a chance to turn this around and then try to educate the groups they've already brought in, but it goes on much longer.
[01:08:49.563 --> 01:08:50.764]  I don't know what we're gonna do, folks.
[01:08:50.784 --> 01:08:51.745]  This is so cold-blooded.
[01:08:53.953 --> 01:09:00.917]  Meanwhile, you've got Soros has gotten over 800 district attorneys and county attorneys elected and installed around the country.
[01:09:00.957 --> 01:09:07.780]  He's got like 22 attorney generals at the state level, and now he's trying to shut down the police, but they don't fully control.
[01:09:10.281 --> 01:09:17.805]  Big headline on Infowars.com, reports Soros non-profits donated more than $35 million to aid anti-police groups just this year so far.
[01:09:18.946 --> 01:09:21.207]  And that's not to get rid of the police, it's to take them over.
[01:09:22.551 --> 01:09:23.492]  These people mean business.
[01:09:23.512 --> 01:09:27.094]  I've already dealt with two Soros judges and the rigged trials against me.
[01:09:27.474 --> 01:09:28.394]  Total weaponization.
[01:09:28.414 --> 01:09:29.715]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[01:09:30.215 --> 01:09:31.496]  Al Killer in Virginia, go ahead.
[01:09:34.058 --> 01:09:51.748]  You know, Steve Bannon was at the Turning Point USA over the weekend and he was on Tim Pool's segment and he hit on the fact that we can't compete with the Federal Reserve when they're able to print money out of thin air.
[01:09:52.578 --> 01:09:58.689]  And at this point, where is the solution on our end?
[01:09:58.870 --> 01:10:00.473]  We already know what the globalists want.
[01:10:00.493 --> 01:10:01.575]  They have their great reset.
[01:10:02.316 --> 01:10:05.218]  What is the solution on the end of this that we want?
[01:10:05.238 --> 01:10:07.140]  Well, you know what I was about to say.
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.001]  Look at what Soros is worried about.
[01:10:09.722 --> 01:10:13.444]  He's worried about district attorneys, county attorneys, state attorney generals.
[01:10:13.464 --> 01:10:21.230]  You've got a bunch of state attorney generals standing up against the carbon tax, standing up against open borders, standing up against the fentanyl, standing up against the human smuggling.
[01:10:21.671 --> 01:10:27.595]  You've got the Texas governor and attorney general doing criminal investigations of the UN NGOs running the border collapse.
[01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:29.417]  We need indictments now.
[01:10:30.137 --> 01:10:41.779]  We need the states to step in where we still have attorney generals and still have prosecutors, and we've got to start prosecuting the deep state Democrats.
[01:10:41.899 --> 01:10:45.320]  Even so, they can do an investigation until they're blue in the face.
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:11:07.328]   Look, if what came out on Twitter yesterday was any indication, with a Republican president, they had the army doing a spy op knowing that the Hunter Biden stuff All the federal agencies working against the President and the American people, with all the big tech companies, illegally.
[01:11:07.348 --> 01:11:07.788]  Yes, you're right.
[01:11:07.808 --> 01:11:08.448]  I appreciate your call.
[01:11:08.788 --> 01:11:09.788]  It's absolutely criminal.
[01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.609]  It's a coup.
[01:11:11.629 --> 01:11:17.091]  We're living inside a globalist, big tech, governmental, corporate coup.
[01:11:17.171 --> 01:11:18.471]  I mean, we're in it.
[01:11:18.651 --> 01:11:19.572]  It ain't coming, folks.
[01:11:20.072 --> 01:11:21.112]  You're in the New World Order now.
[01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:23.813]  Adrian in Pennsylvania, welcome.
[01:11:25.553 --> 01:11:26.733]  Oh, hey, this is awesome.
[01:11:27.013 --> 01:11:30.594]  I want to thank you for the Real Red Pilt Plus coming back in.
[01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:36.055]  Because for two years, my mom has not stopped talking about, when is it going to get it back in?
[01:11:36.075 --> 01:11:37.255]  Is it going to come back in?
[01:11:37.735 --> 01:11:46.437]  I even looked at the bottle for the formulation to see if I can match it with the Heron beer to get some other stuff, but there's just too much going on in there.
[01:11:46.757 --> 01:11:50.038]  Well, describe for us what it did for your mother, because it really helps old folks.
[01:11:51.243 --> 01:11:53.904]  Well, my mom has a lot of health problems.
[01:11:53.944 --> 01:11:58.186]  She's been on disability for years, since I was probably about 12.
[01:11:58.787 --> 01:11:59.447]  I'm 40 now.
[01:12:00.087 --> 01:12:05.150]  And between that, the turmeric, the X2, she feels amazing.
[01:12:05.490 --> 01:12:10.132]  The only thing that she would want me to ask is, when's the down and out coming back?
[01:12:11.308 --> 01:12:12.189]  Well, that's our problem.
[01:12:12.209 --> 01:12:16.074]  We haven't had enough money to order all the products we used to have, and that's why we're going to catch 22.
[01:12:16.114 --> 01:12:25.687]  That's why I may need to just do a fundraiser to try to get like $400,000 or $500,000 to then buy a product, and then we can sell it and make a profit, and it's kind of a self-fulfilling deal.
[01:12:25.727 --> 01:12:26.468]  That's how that works.
[01:12:26.488 --> 01:12:27.769]  It's kind of like a farmer...
[01:12:28.596 --> 01:12:32.117]   We'll have that last crop, they don't have enough money to buy more seed the next year,
[01:12:32.117 --> 01:12:37.476]   they got to shut down. And so we're kind of at that nexus point of really needing more support.
[01:12:37.476 --> 01:12:40.996]   We're in the catch 22 of selling things at discounts, so not enough money comes in.
[01:12:40.996 --> 01:12:46.197]   But I've got some fundraising ideas in the new year that should help keep us on air. If everybody
[01:12:46.197 --> 01:12:51.237]   just buys the products we've got now and Real Red Pill Plus is back, we'll be able to stay on air.
[01:12:51.237 --> 01:12:58.036]   But it's very close. So a challenge and a proposal I have for listeners is
[01:12:58.916 --> 01:13:02.105]  I didn't buy products for years, but I love the information.
[01:13:02.105 --> 01:13:07.197]   And I woke people up and it was very, very popular because people were very surprised that there
[01:13:07.197 --> 01:13:11.157]   was something else actually happening outside of the mainstream media.
[01:13:11.346 --> 01:13:16.350]  And then I started to buy the products and started to feel amazing and then get other people to buy the products.
[01:13:16.370 --> 01:13:22.735]  So if you're a listener who doesn't buy products, you're taking something special away from this broadcast.
[01:13:23.334 --> 01:13:27.476]  Buy one product a month, give it to a friend, use it yourself, give it to a loved one.
[01:13:27.957 --> 01:13:31.078]  And I think that way, because we are in a war.
[01:13:31.619 --> 01:13:40.064]  It's a fifth generation information war, asymmetrical, everything Dr. Malone says, everything you said, that's absolutely true.
[01:13:40.944 --> 01:13:52.767]   So in order to keep you alive and through this process, With all the information we're going to need, especially into the future, because it's just beginning now, what we're going to hit.
[01:13:53.587 --> 01:14:00.809]  I would say buy one product a month and use it, give it to somebody, but keep it open and keep it going.
[01:14:01.129 --> 01:14:06.331]  Now, before I take up too much time, Daniel Eskimo, you guys did a lot of great work together in the past.
[01:14:06.851 --> 01:14:10.292]  He has a great book called 2045 Global Projects at War.
[01:14:10.972 --> 01:14:23.826]   And in the melee of where we are right now, globally, He does a great job breaking down that there are multiple projects at war that are fighting for supremacy around the planet.
[01:14:23.866 --> 01:14:25.988]  I think that'd be an excellent interview.
[01:14:26.668 --> 01:14:30.331]  Plus he does the trans evolution book on the transhumanism.
[01:14:30.691 --> 01:14:31.392]  And so I think it'd be great.
[01:14:31.412 --> 01:14:31.732]  That's right.
[01:14:31.752 --> 01:14:34.054]  I haven't had Esselen on in probably six, seven years.
[01:14:34.134 --> 01:14:35.355]  Let's get Daniel Esselen on.
[01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:37.416]  I haven't read his new book, but you're right.
[01:14:37.877 --> 01:14:38.997]  There are, I'm going to explain it.
[01:14:39.838 --> 01:14:52.583]  Globalists all want AI, they all want robots, they all want GMO, they all want chips, but there are different globalist power blocks that interface who are competing with each other over who will finally get the total global system and the AI.
[01:14:52.983 --> 01:14:57.665]  And that's in the documents about will the US have the new digital currency or will it be the Chinese?
[01:14:58.045 --> 01:15:03.127]  And you're right, there's all these competing forces that are working for control of Satan's kingdom.
[01:15:03.527 --> 01:15:05.508]  So I haven't read the book, what's it break down?
[01:15:06.789 --> 01:15:08.650]  Well, it breaks down exactly what you're saying.
[01:15:08.911 --> 01:15:21.000]  And, you know, as we see this language coming out, these buzzwords, multipolar world order, and, you know, it seems like this group's clicking up with this group and they're against that group as all the global currencies are collapsing.
[01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:31.848]  I mean, we're watching the entire crypto market collapse, which is bringing down the bond market, which is going to introduce us into the new panic problem reaction solution, which says, oh, well, here's the digital money.
[01:15:32.637 --> 01:15:34.358]  And then we're in any trap.
[01:15:34.718 --> 01:15:38.800]  So just the book, the book would be great for you guys to talk about.
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:40.601]  It ties in with everything.
[01:15:40.641 --> 01:15:42.621]  He's really smart and he's really connected.
[01:15:42.701 --> 01:15:43.362]  And I agree.
[01:15:43.382 --> 01:15:45.543]  There are competing globalist forces.
[01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:46.803]  Thank you so much for the call, Adrian.
[01:15:47.464 --> 01:15:47.804]  All right.
[01:15:48.064 --> 01:15:51.305]  I only got to a little bit of calls that segment, but I'm going to do good.
[01:15:51.325 --> 01:15:53.106]  I'm going to take calls the whole next hour as well.
[01:15:53.806 --> 01:15:54.487]  But let's do this.
[01:15:54.587 --> 01:15:55.227]  I'm going to do this.
[01:15:56.287 --> 01:15:57.368]  No matter how good the calls are.
[01:15:58.490 --> 01:15:59.771]  I'm going to cut you off in two minutes.
[01:15:59.891 --> 01:16:00.992]  So we're going to go to Justin.
[01:16:01.293 --> 01:16:02.174]  We're going to go to Josh.
[01:16:02.194 --> 01:16:03.014]  We're going to go to Stan.
[01:16:03.034 --> 01:16:03.635]  We're going to go to Henry.
[01:16:03.655 --> 01:16:04.336]  We're going to go to Ed.
[01:16:04.376 --> 01:16:04.856]  Next segment.
[01:16:05.697 --> 01:16:07.459]  We're going to get five calls in.
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.501]  It's a ten and a half minute segment.
[01:16:10.502 --> 01:16:12.303]  So we're going to get to your calls.
[01:16:13.732 --> 01:16:22.596]  Coming up, right out of the gates, I'm going right to you, and then Russell, Jordan, Carlos, Jefferson, and many, many others that are joining us, 877-789-2539.
[01:16:22.616 --> 01:16:27.998]  But absolutely, folks, look, you don't know how much the Newelder hates this show.
[01:16:28.198 --> 01:16:28.878]  They hate you.
[01:16:29.158 --> 01:16:29.839]  They hate our guests.
[01:16:29.859 --> 01:16:30.379]  They hate me.
[01:16:30.779 --> 01:16:33.000]  They hate the idea that we're still here to spot all the attacks.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:35.421]  We are everything they can't stand.
[01:16:36.161 --> 01:16:44.766]  So when you share the articles or share the videos or share the live link and say, this is forbidden, check it out and tell others to check it out and tell them to check it out and tell them to check it out and let me check it out.
[01:16:44.806 --> 01:16:46.707]  When you do that, it's over.
[01:16:47.447 --> 01:16:49.348]  But if we don't, we can just roll over and die.
[01:16:49.768 --> 01:16:51.709]  Or I guess you could go join the New World Order if you want.
[01:16:51.749 --> 01:16:52.990]  I mean, that's your options.
[01:16:53.790 --> 01:16:56.412]  But joining the New World Order is a fate worse than death.
[01:16:56.832 --> 01:16:58.053]  We'll be right back with your call.
[01:16:58.073 --> 01:16:58.493]  Straight ahead.
[01:16:58.513 --> 01:16:58.913]  Stay with us.
[01:17:00.134 --> 01:17:04.296]  Remember, all these ugly globalists are going against God.
[01:17:05.322 --> 01:17:07.544]  They're only here to make us stronger and test us.
[01:17:08.105 --> 01:17:10.086]  God that made the universe is infinite.
[01:17:11.167 --> 01:17:12.609]  His creation is infinite.
[01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:15.691]  And our communion with God's spirit is eternal.
[01:17:18.614 --> 01:17:19.014]  All right.
[01:17:20.976 --> 01:17:21.537]  I'm not men.
[01:17:23.624 --> 01:17:24.725]  Trying to whet your appetite.
[01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:26.826]  I'm going to play this Dr. Michael Yeadon incredible clip.
[01:17:26.866 --> 01:17:29.867]  I just keep taking your calls, but next hour I will get to it early.
[01:17:30.547 --> 01:17:34.509]  Right now, as I promised, let's take five phone calls in the next 10 minutes.
[01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:36.790]  Justin in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:17:38.611 --> 01:17:39.672]  Hey Alex Jones, man.
[01:17:39.712 --> 01:17:40.472]  I love you, brother.
[01:17:40.732 --> 01:17:45.054]  I'm a first-time caller and I'm going to try to find out what it's like to ride the tip of the spear, man.
[01:17:45.074 --> 01:17:45.755]  This is awesome.
[01:17:45.775 --> 01:17:52.838]  Listen, as I've been waking up over the last six to eight years, I've been trying to figure out ways I can reach my friends, neighbors, co-workers.
[01:17:53.311 --> 01:17:54.411]  My own family members.
[01:17:55.012 --> 01:18:12.979]  And, you know, as I first started off trying to, you know, explain globalism and these globalist organizations that are moving us towards this one world government, if you will, I found like that's trying to connect the bottom of the pyramid with the top of the pyramid and you lose people there.
[01:18:13.159 --> 01:18:21.101]   And what Elon's been doing over the last You know, two or three weeks, exposing our own government's corruption.
[01:18:21.121 --> 01:18:25.844]  Oh, I have to say what Elon's been doing is no way it doesn't hurt the New World Order.
[01:18:26.424 --> 01:18:27.605]  And that's so paradoxical.
[01:18:27.645 --> 01:18:28.846]  I disagree with a lot of what he does.
[01:18:28.866 --> 01:18:29.966]  I don't completely trust him.
[01:18:30.426 --> 01:18:31.387]  He's keeping me banned.
[01:18:31.667 --> 01:18:34.649]  But I would be a liar if I didn't say he's the new Alex Jones.
[01:18:35.049 --> 01:18:38.211]  He's doing more in a month than I've done in the last five years.
[01:18:38.271 --> 01:18:39.612]  He is wrecking their system.
[01:18:40.751 --> 01:18:58.109]  Hey brother, I don't trust him no farther than I can throw him, but the enemy of my enemy is my friend, and we need to actually... I know he probably has his own agenda at the end of all this, which is probably his own version of control, but we need, you know, if we stay vigilant, we, you know... Well, that's what the founders said.
[01:18:58.169 --> 01:19:02.274]  Separation of powers is, you use one would-be dictator against the other dictator.
[01:19:03.562 --> 01:19:04.163]  Absolutely.
[01:19:04.723 --> 01:19:15.933]  And what I found is, as Elon's doing this, I'm trying to wake people up around me, is that most people, if you try to talk to them that are apolitical, they'll say, hey, listen, they're all corrupt.
[01:19:15.973 --> 01:19:16.634]  Both parties.
[01:19:17.234 --> 01:19:18.555]  And absolutely, that's right.
[01:19:19.176 --> 01:19:21.598]  But there's no doubt the Democrats are the leading edge.
[01:19:21.738 --> 01:19:22.859]  I mean, they are the best.
[01:19:23.917 --> 01:19:31.538]  A hundred percent, but you have your key Republicans in the higher levels of our government that are just as bad if not worse.
[01:19:31.578 --> 01:19:38.940]  Like you mentioned the open borders, you know, Lindsey Graham, Mitch McConnell, all these globalists, they're just as much open borders as a Chuck Schumer or Joe Biden.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:54.712]   But the point I was trying to make is that when we, you know, try to wake up our neighbors and friends to connect, you know, the middle of the pyramid to the top, and that's our deep state, our globalist government, and the reason why Most people on both sides of the aisle are frustrated with government as a whole.
[01:19:54.792 --> 01:20:03.378]  It's because they don't realize that these people... So there's a permanent bureaucracy in both parties, frustrating the will of the American people at every level.
[01:20:03.678 --> 01:20:06.099]  The beachhead of populism is the Republican Party.
[01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:07.901]  That's why it's threatening the New World Order.
[01:20:07.941 --> 01:20:08.761]  Great points, thank you.
[01:20:09.101 --> 01:20:11.123]  Josh in FEMA Region 3, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:14.917]  Alex, how's it going, man?
[01:20:15.497 --> 01:20:23.302]  Just wanted to touch... I called in before I plugged X2 about how it had me dreaming again after not dreaming for 15 years.
[01:20:23.342 --> 01:20:27.144]  Well, I just wanted to give an update to that real quick.
[01:20:27.384 --> 01:20:33.848]  My son had really high lead levels, and I did a little investigating, and it turns out iodine works really well for that.
[01:20:34.408 --> 01:20:40.312]  So I've been giving it to him for about a month and a half now, just one drop, and it's cut his lead levels down in half.
[01:20:41.441 --> 01:20:42.202]  He was at 10.
[01:20:42.322 --> 01:20:43.202]  He's now at 5.
[01:20:43.662 --> 01:20:44.243]  Well, that's right.
[01:20:44.263 --> 01:20:46.704]  Your body can't offload toxins without iodine.
[01:20:46.724 --> 01:20:47.764]  I wish we weren't sold out of it.
[01:20:49.405 --> 01:20:58.610]  Yeah, and so it's just, you know, it's been a real... Like, I'm just real thankful for that because, you know, it's kind of... Well, you understand, most iodines are not atomic and are garbage.
[01:20:58.630 --> 01:20:59.810]  That's why it's got to be atomic.
[01:21:00.831 --> 01:21:01.051]  Right.
[01:21:02.011 --> 01:21:04.893]  Yeah, I love the X2, the X3, you know.
[01:21:04.953 --> 01:21:06.513]  I can't wait for you guys to get it back up.
[01:21:06.613 --> 01:21:09.715]  I'm signed up for an alert for when it comes back.
[01:21:10.382 --> 01:21:12.084]  But yeah, that was just on that.
[01:21:13.545 --> 01:21:22.794]  On the border and defunding Zelensky and all these criminals, we just have to stop providing them the funds.
[01:21:22.894 --> 01:21:24.916]  It really comes down to that, that simple.
[01:21:25.136 --> 01:21:26.677]  Because who's paying for all this?
[01:21:26.718 --> 01:21:27.758]  They're not paying for it.
[01:21:28.099 --> 01:21:28.459]  We are.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:29.280]  The people.
[01:21:30.259 --> 01:21:34.282]  You think about the homelessness and how they're taking people's houses.
[01:21:34.842 --> 01:21:38.545]  I know people that the IRS is taking their house after one missed IRS payment.
[01:21:38.945 --> 01:21:42.628]  I know people, Wells Fargo just got caught doing it, who missed one mortgage payment.
[01:21:42.648 --> 01:21:44.650]  They're taking their house outside of law.
[01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:48.012]  The American people are being raped of every race, color and creed.
[01:21:48.513 --> 01:21:54.037]  And then they're telling us, oh, we got to take care of this third world population where they shut them down for two years and made them come here.
[01:21:54.277 --> 01:21:56.859]  So they're not my enemies, but they're still being used as a weapon.
[01:21:58.519 --> 01:21:58.899]  Correct.
[01:21:59.699 --> 01:22:00.040]  Correct.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:04.661]  Yeah, we just have to stop funding it, no matter what it takes.
[01:22:05.041 --> 01:22:11.424]  Look, anybody that can get to a rural area and work on a farm or start your own farm or learn to barter, the whole future is going to be that.
[01:22:11.784 --> 01:22:12.604]  That's so clear.
[01:22:12.984 --> 01:22:16.986]  The entire future is going to be getting out of the megacities and this whole market of the beast.
[01:22:17.026 --> 01:22:20.107]  We're just getting ready right now, getting as many people warned as possible.
[01:22:20.127 --> 01:22:22.048]  We're going to go through hell, but God's on the other side.
[01:22:23.388 --> 01:22:24.008]  Absolutely.
[01:22:24.048 --> 01:22:25.069]  God bless, Alex.
[01:22:25.509 --> 01:22:25.949]  Love you, brother.
[01:22:27.708 --> 01:22:28.168]  Absolutely.
[01:22:28.189 --> 01:22:29.349]  Let's talk to Stan in Utah.
[01:22:29.369 --> 01:22:29.970]  Stan, you're on the air.
[01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:31.691]  Go ahead.
[01:22:31.751 --> 01:22:32.272]  Hey, Alex.
[01:22:32.832 --> 01:22:34.554]  Yeah, thanks for that last statement.
[01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:35.775]  I did do that.
[01:22:35.815 --> 01:22:39.558]  Me and my family were moved to a rural community in Utah.
[01:22:39.758 --> 01:22:40.138]  Love it.
[01:22:40.158 --> 01:22:41.279]  We're doing a hobby farm.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.741]  We have raised chickens and all that good stuff.
[01:22:44.041 --> 01:22:52.648]  The reason I'm calling is in memory of my father, I have a relative who passed away because they were euthanized in a hospital in New Zealand.
[01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:54.530]  Back off your phone just a little bit.
[01:22:55.689 --> 01:22:56.109]  Oh, sorry.
[01:22:56.809 --> 01:23:08.852]  Uh, he's in a hospital in New Zealand, and we have an 18-page medical report that proves the timing and the medicines used that caused the death of my father.
[01:23:08.872 --> 01:23:10.673]  Let me guess, remdesivir?
[01:23:12.133 --> 01:23:12.734]  Nope.
[01:23:12.834 --> 01:23:17.975]  When he went in, we said no remdesivir, no intubation.
[01:23:18.695 --> 01:23:21.256]  And that may have been like a red flag for the hospital.
[01:23:21.556 --> 01:23:35.772]   Anyway, we But we started with that requirement, but as he was in hospital within a 24-hour period, he was already talking coherent, was able to breathe without oxygen 11 days later he did.
[01:23:36.952 --> 01:23:44.396]  And so what Reason on Corners is to ask the medical professionals around the world, you know, have a conscience.
[01:23:45.197 --> 01:23:46.597]  Please listen to your conscience.
[01:23:46.657 --> 01:23:55.814]   If you're questioning what Medical authorities are telling you what to do and how to administer certain protocols that are just aberrations of the medical system.
[01:23:56.435 --> 01:24:01.540]  Please stand up and say something like these good doctors, Dr. Peter McCullough and... No, you're right.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.403]  So, Stan, are you from New Zealand or Australia to Utah?
[01:24:05.524 --> 01:24:06.445]  New Zealand.
[01:24:06.485 --> 01:24:07.767]  I'm an American patriot.
[01:24:08.763 --> 01:24:30.892]  Wow, what is it like for you to see, I'm so sad about your dad, you're totally right, everybody needs to learn medical protocols, everybody's got to learn, it's easy with any illness to know what works and what doesn't when you go to these hospitals, because they're ordered to carry out protocols that kill people, and a lot of hospitals are good, some are bad, but the point is you've got to know your rights, but what is it like for you to see what New Zealand's turned into since you left it?
[01:24:32.593 --> 01:24:37.917]  At the age of 12 I watched a movie that was made by the New Zealand government called Sleeping Dogs.
[01:24:38.037 --> 01:24:44.582]  It stars Sam Neill before he became famous and it's about how New Zealand becomes a police state.
[01:24:45.403 --> 01:24:54.891]  So we're talking about it in our social studies class like well this can never happen in New Zealand and lo and behold almost 50 years later it's here.
[01:24:55.906 --> 01:24:57.307]  That's what's stunning about this.
[01:24:58.087 --> 01:25:04.110]  The secret combinations of conspiracies are 100% real.
[01:25:04.270 --> 01:25:06.792]  I woke up by studying the United States Constitution.
[01:25:06.872 --> 01:25:10.814]  I have a great lust for that document and what the Founding Fathers did.
[01:25:11.812 --> 01:25:15.394]  I've learned that this is a spiritual battle, most of all.
[01:25:15.414 --> 01:25:17.855]  If I have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ... You're right, Stan.
[01:25:17.915 --> 01:25:19.396]  It is 100% spiritual.
[01:25:19.476 --> 01:25:20.197]  It's all a test.
[01:25:20.237 --> 01:25:20.757]  God bless you.
[01:25:20.777 --> 01:25:21.337]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:21.738 --> 01:25:22.778]  One more caller before we go to break.
[01:25:22.898 --> 01:25:23.999]  Henry in Arizona.
[01:25:24.319 --> 01:25:24.739]  Oh no, sorry.
[01:25:24.779 --> 01:25:25.300]  Russell's next.
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.021]  I'm jumping around here.
[01:25:27.041 --> 01:25:27.541]  I apologize.
[01:25:28.602 --> 01:25:29.302]  Russell in Oregon.
[01:25:29.342 --> 01:25:29.662]  Go ahead.
[01:25:30.903 --> 01:25:32.304]  Aloha, Uncle Alex.
[01:25:32.464 --> 01:25:33.624]  God bless you, sir.
[01:25:34.805 --> 01:25:54.358]   I just wanted to bring up briefly that yesterday it was announced that Elon Musk has committed 10,000 more Starlink antenna to Ukraine in addition to the 22,000 that are currently operational, which is the foundation for government, civilian and military communications for Ukraine.
[01:25:55.138 --> 01:26:03.385]  So, to me, this is the leverage for him to be able to call for peace negotiations and instead he is giving them more infrastructure.
[01:26:03.405 --> 01:26:04.105]  That's what he does.
[01:26:04.165 --> 01:26:05.186]  He plays both sides.
[01:26:05.466 --> 01:26:08.449]  It's like he does all this great stuff on one hand and bad things on the other.
[01:26:09.488 --> 01:26:36.574]  Well, you know, and I just thought that it was worth mentioning to you and to the callers, because that's a 50% increase in the infrastructure that they already have, and the operation is DARPA and NASA funded, and we're paying for this, and he's making money off of it, and this is the opportunity to be able to say, hey, we demand a pathway to peace negotiations, and it's not happening.
[01:26:36.963 --> 01:26:37.403]  No, I agree.
[01:26:37.423 --> 01:26:38.764]  Let me explain what's happening with Musk.
[01:26:38.924 --> 01:26:41.105]  He's a front guy for the military-industrial complex.
[01:26:41.645 --> 01:26:43.485]  And so it's not that they're anti-New World Order.
[01:26:43.946 --> 01:26:48.327]  They want to control over how leftist and globalist it gets.
[01:26:48.767 --> 01:26:54.410]  So Musk is just a throttle or a control arm for them to control what they do with it.
[01:26:54.670 --> 01:26:56.830]  Because if they don't control the left, it's out of control.
[01:26:56.850 --> 01:26:58.511]  So they're going to control the left and right.
[01:26:58.531 --> 01:27:00.632]  You see how it's an instrumental situation?
[01:27:01.639 --> 01:27:03.260]  I absolutely do, Alex.
[01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.240]  Hold on, don't hang up.
[01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:04.921]  Don't hang up, Russell.
[01:27:04.941 --> 01:27:06.041]  We'll give you more time when you come back.
[01:27:06.061 --> 01:27:06.741]  You got cut short.
[01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:10.803]  And then Ed in Texas and Henry and Cindy and Bart and Paul.
[01:27:10.823 --> 01:27:15.445]  We're going to take your calls in the order they're received back in T-minus two minutes with hour number three.
[01:27:16.766 --> 01:27:20.687]  Into hour number three, ladies and gentlemen, taking your phone calls.
[01:27:21.328 --> 01:27:25.289]  Russell in Oregon had some more good points to make about Starlink and Elon Musk.
[01:27:25.329 --> 01:27:26.290]  Please continue, Russell.
[01:27:27.881 --> 01:27:47.064]   Well, Alex, I just feel like this is, again, the point of leverage between negotiating for peace and for continuing to It's a total giant weapon system beyond GPS rolled out under Elon Musk's auspices.
[01:27:47.084 --> 01:27:50.605]  That way they can't say the Pentagon's attacking Russia.
[01:27:51.125 --> 01:27:57.125]   conscripted in August of 2022 this year by DARPA with a lot of...
[01:27:57.125 --> 01:28:03.125]   No, it's a total giant weapons system beyond GPS rolled out under Elon Musk's auspices.
[01:28:03.125 --> 01:28:07.125]   That way they can't say the Pentagon's attacking Russia. Oh, it's just Elon Musk.
[01:28:08.059 --> 01:28:17.175]  And they're creating a system called BACN, and that's going to be a total global network of infrastructure of these low-Earth orbiting satellites.
[01:28:17.236 --> 01:28:20.141]  They're going to try to sell driving cars, all the AI.
[01:28:20.241 --> 01:28:20.602]  It's bad.
[01:28:21.551 --> 01:28:31.820]  And just on a totally unrelated subject, I just want to recommend, if it's possible, could you invite Whitney Webb on to do a long-format interview with you?
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:35.262]  She is an amazing voice for truth.
[01:28:36.624 --> 01:28:37.644]  Who is Whitney Webb?
[01:28:37.684 --> 01:28:38.405]  What's her website?
[01:28:39.946 --> 01:28:46.832]  Unlimitedhangout.com, and she is one of the most incredible journalists in the world right now.
[01:28:46.912 --> 01:28:48.433]  She's an American in exile.
[01:28:49.778 --> 01:28:51.339]  Good afternoon, sir.
[01:28:51.359 --> 01:28:52.059]  Pleasure, Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:28:51.878 --> 01:28:53.118]  Let's get Whitney Webb on.
[01:28:53.118 --> 01:28:54.679]  I'll believe you, we'll get her on.
[01:28:54.679 --> 01:28:56.518]  Whitney Webb, Unlimited Hangout.
[01:28:56.518 --> 01:29:02.078]   I really appreciate the time, Alex, and just hope you have a great Christmas,
[01:29:02.078 --> 01:29:03.038]  and God bless you.
[01:29:03.038 --> 01:29:04.519]  Appreciate you, brother.
[01:29:04.519 --> 01:29:06.398]  All right, let's go to Ed in Texas.
[01:29:06.398 --> 01:29:08.198]  Ed, thank you for holding.
[01:29:08.198 --> 01:29:09.318]  Good afternoon, sir.
[01:29:09.318 --> 01:29:11.158]  Pleasure, Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:29:11.158 --> 01:29:12.398]  Welcome.
[01:29:12.398 --> 01:29:15.318]   I just wanted to let you know I'm a cross-country truck driver,
[01:29:15.318 --> 01:29:19.878]  and I've been noticing a lot of unmarked buses at night.
[01:29:19.878 --> 01:29:21.198]  They're traveling at night.
[01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:22.291]  I don't see them during the day.
[01:29:22.371 --> 01:29:23.091]  Oh, they admit that.
[01:29:23.111 --> 01:29:27.012]  They're processing and transferring the illegals during the night to cover it up.
[01:29:27.192 --> 01:29:27.653]  That's admitted.
[01:29:27.673 --> 01:29:28.793]  That came out of the Biden administration.
[01:29:29.113 --> 01:29:34.555]  Then they stop at hotels that are totally rented out just for the illegals, and then they move to the next site.
[01:29:34.635 --> 01:29:35.435]  It's incredible, isn't it?
[01:29:36.455 --> 01:29:42.777]  Yeah, I've been seeing them at truck stops, at Pilot Flying J. They lock up the bathroom.
[01:29:42.997 --> 01:29:44.598]  You know, a lot of people are going in and out.
[01:29:45.725 --> 01:29:48.588]  What else would you like to add as a truck driver?
[01:29:48.427 --> 01:29:50.427]  because they think they're gonna steal something.
[01:29:50.427 --> 01:29:54.427]  And I just think it's pretty nutty.
[01:29:54.427 --> 01:29:56.427]  What else would you like to add as a truck driver?
[01:29:56.427 --> 01:29:58.427]  I know you see a lot of stuff, brother.
[01:29:58.427 --> 01:30:04.427]   I saw yesterday, I seen a van, unmarked white van, with random children in it.
[01:30:04.427 --> 01:30:06.427]  They don't look like any of them are...
[01:30:06.427 --> 01:30:08.427]  I've been seeing a lot of weird stuff, Mr. Jones.
[01:30:08.590 --> 01:30:09.611]  A lot of weird stuff.
[01:30:10.211 --> 01:30:11.892]  A lot of people being moored around the country.
[01:30:11.912 --> 01:30:12.933]  Let's just put it that way.
[01:30:12.953 --> 01:30:14.635]  And where are the children going?
[01:30:15.075 --> 01:30:20.339]  We videotaped the white vans where they just put babies, two-year-olds, six-year-olds, seven-year-olds, boys and girls.
[01:30:20.359 --> 01:30:21.040]  They just get on them.
[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:21.580]  No parents.
[01:30:21.740 --> 01:30:22.261]  Goodbye!
[01:30:22.281 --> 01:30:23.862]  It's not even government vans.
[01:30:23.882 --> 01:30:24.743]  They just disappear.
[01:30:25.973 --> 01:30:27.273]  No idea, but this is happening.
[01:30:27.313 --> 01:30:28.774]  Everything you're saying is happening.
[01:30:28.794 --> 01:30:31.975]  People just need to open their eyes and just pay closer attention.
[01:30:32.255 --> 01:30:33.775]  I mean, I see it because I'm always on the road.
[01:30:34.055 --> 01:30:47.840]  But brother, you should start, you should start, obviously not use your name or they'll go after you through your company, but you should start a YouTube, a Twitter, a Facebook, or send us clips at ShowTipsAndInfoWars.com and just shoot video of the stuff you see, brother.
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:49.100]  I will.
[01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:50.020]  I will, for sure.
[01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:51.121]  Well, we love you, Ed.
[01:30:51.141 --> 01:30:52.061]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:30:52.998 --> 01:30:54.039]  Well, Mrs. Jones, I love you.
[01:30:54.059 --> 01:30:54.820]  Keep up the good fight.
[01:30:54.840 --> 01:30:55.261]  Thank you.
[01:30:55.301 --> 01:30:56.282]  Thank you for the crew.
[01:30:56.362 --> 01:30:57.443]  Thank you for your product.
[01:30:57.643 --> 01:30:58.384]  I've got your coins.
[01:30:58.444 --> 01:30:59.145]  I've got your book.
[01:30:59.485 --> 01:31:00.366]  Keep on fighting.
[01:31:00.426 --> 01:31:01.047]  Stay strong.
[01:31:01.087 --> 01:31:01.528]  I love you.
[01:31:01.568 --> 01:31:02.229]  Happy holidays.
[01:31:02.529 --> 01:31:03.450]  Well, you say you love me.
[01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:03.930]  I love you.
[01:31:03.991 --> 01:31:04.651]  Let me just be clear.
[01:31:05.072 --> 01:31:07.855]  Without people like you that just called, we would be off air already.
[01:31:08.936 --> 01:31:11.179]  And you have my word of honor.
[01:31:12.233 --> 01:31:15.355]  That all the stuff you see in the news is either a total lie or a twisted fact.
[01:31:15.776 --> 01:31:16.716]  We don't have extra money.
[01:31:16.877 --> 01:31:17.617]  It's all BS.
[01:31:18.358 --> 01:31:24.843]  And we're going to stay on air for at least two years of appeals in this show if you simply fund InfoWars.
[01:31:26.178 --> 01:31:29.579]  The good news is we're only about $250,000 a month behind.
[01:31:29.619 --> 01:31:31.279]  That sounds like a lot for an operation this big.
[01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:32.920]  Our bandwidth costs more than that.
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:34.280]  So we're right there.
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.260]  It's just so frustrating.
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:39.622]  I'm like, God, I could focus more on the show if I wasn't scrambling to get money all day.
[01:31:39.982 --> 01:31:43.022]  I spent half my time trying to get funds and I'm not complaining.
[01:31:43.122 --> 01:31:44.943]  I just, that's not what I should be doing.
[01:31:44.963 --> 01:31:46.063]  I want to follow special reports.
[01:31:46.483 --> 01:31:48.804]  I want to do interviews, but just see God's in control.
[01:31:49.524 --> 01:31:52.366]  And God's working through you, but just please go to InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:31:52.767 --> 01:31:55.209]  The great InfoWars MD line is out.
[01:31:55.249 --> 01:31:55.789]  Look into it.
[01:31:57.110 --> 01:32:00.212]  Real Red Bull Plus is back in stock with the InfoWars Platinum line that's amazing.
[01:32:00.513 --> 01:32:01.713]  We've got everything for everybody.
[01:32:01.754 --> 01:32:03.535]  Whatever you need, we've got the best stuff.
[01:32:03.595 --> 01:32:04.416]  InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:32:04.456 --> 01:32:25.456]  We'll be right back with more Calls in 60 Seconds.
[01:32:25.827 --> 01:32:37.997]  Now in 60 seconds, it's hard to tell you how incredible these products are, but all of these products are already sold on store shelves under other brand names for up to twice the cost we're selling it to you.
[01:32:38.277 --> 01:32:39.478]  These are high-end.
[01:32:39.498 --> 01:32:40.539]  These are the very best.
[01:32:40.839 --> 01:32:42.800]  You know our Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing?
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:43.821]  Well, guess what?
[01:32:43.861 --> 01:32:48.983]  We now have Turmeric 95 that's basically the same formula for a lower price.
[01:32:49.624 --> 01:32:51.645]  CBD oil of the highest quality.
[01:32:52.285 --> 01:32:58.908]  Up to 50% less than major competitors selling the exact high-quality, full-spectrum CBD.
[01:32:59.148 --> 01:33:03.991]  And it goes on for all the new InfoWars MD products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:33:04.351 --> 01:33:14.067]   The highest quality directly from the manufacturer to your door at prices up to Fifty percent, in some cases a hundred percent lower than what they're sold for in stores.
[01:33:14.408 --> 01:33:16.394]  M4 Wars MD at M4WarsStore.com.
[01:33:21.368 --> 01:33:25.191]  Well, I love taking your calls as you take us in so many amazing directions.
[01:33:25.211 --> 01:33:27.433]  We'll go back to the calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:33:27.473 --> 01:33:29.175]  But first, let's hit the COVID stack of the day.
[01:33:29.195 --> 01:33:32.958]  I usually hit it at the start of the show, but I get people get COVID fatigued.
[01:33:32.978 --> 01:33:37.662]  But this is one of their main takeover arms, bringing the Castle Society, the Worldwide Vaccine Passport.
[01:33:37.682 --> 01:33:49.592]  But here's Dr. Michael Yidan, massive patent holder, head of Pfizer's vaccine program, then their head of all their science division, the actual head of the product production.
[01:33:50.555 --> 01:33:55.477]  You like have the head of the NSA as a politician, you don't have the head of technical like Dr. William Binney.
[01:33:55.938 --> 01:33:58.899]  This was the head until 2018 when he retired.
[01:33:58.918 --> 01:34:10.298]   2018 when he retired. So he comes out in 2020 with an emergency letter with the
[01:34:10.298 --> 01:34:14.719]   head lawyer of the EU, the head lawyer of their medical system Wolfgang Wudard
[01:34:14.719 --> 01:34:20.797]   and they file an emergency multi hundred page report with all the links saying
[01:34:20.797 --> 01:34:23.998]   we need an emergency injunction these shots will cause heart attacks,
[01:34:23.998 --> 01:34:30.358]   myocarditis, infertility, blood clots. They've already done my studies with mRNA
[01:34:30.358 --> 01:34:35.358]  shots for for coronavirus because mice get that as well.
[01:34:33.493 --> 01:34:35.753]  And mice, again, act just the same as us.
[01:34:36.193 --> 01:34:41.094]  Two animals act identical to humans with any poison, any virus, any pathogen.
[01:34:41.474 --> 01:34:46.075]  They are mice and rats, which are the same family, and pigs.
[01:34:47.955 --> 01:34:50.836]  Basically 100% identical when it comes to how we respond.
[01:34:51.996 --> 01:34:58.337]  And so they already have the studies, just like the CDC document in October 2000 said, it'll cause heart attacks, blood clots, all that.
[01:35:00.273 --> 01:35:01.494]  He is not a Christian.
[01:35:01.614 --> 01:35:02.535]  He's a scientist.
[01:35:02.595 --> 01:35:03.676]  He didn't believe in God.
[01:35:04.156 --> 01:35:05.518]  And I've seen speeches he's given.
[01:35:06.118 --> 01:35:09.541]  He says now, after watching this, he thinks it's satanic.
[01:35:10.902 --> 01:35:13.465]  The coordination is, like, not human.
[01:35:14.005 --> 01:35:14.766]  It's next level.
[01:35:14.786 --> 01:35:18.149]  Anybody that studies this pulls back and goes, whoa, this is spiritual.
[01:35:18.509 --> 01:35:19.410]  This is interdimensional.
[01:35:20.511 --> 01:35:21.372]  That's what spiritual means.
[01:35:22.335 --> 01:35:25.578]  We only see in the light spectrum less than 10% of the light spectrum.
[01:35:25.958 --> 01:35:31.483]  Light spectrum, depending on what analysis you look at, is like one billionth of the data.
[01:35:31.903 --> 01:35:39.590]  Just like you don't see cell phone radiation, you don't see radiation from a block of uranium or plutonium, most laser beams you can't even see.
[01:35:40.110 --> 01:35:41.571]  Most stuff we can't see.
[01:35:42.292 --> 01:35:42.592]  Alright?
[01:35:42.652 --> 01:35:43.753]  That's all that is.
[01:35:44.414 --> 01:35:48.537]  And he's saying this is Satan worship.
[01:35:49.318 --> 01:35:50.539]  What these shots do, here he is.
[01:35:51.789 --> 01:35:53.251]  The clinical trials were fraudulent.
[01:35:53.351 --> 01:35:55.094]  There are court cases ongoing right now.
[01:35:55.475 --> 01:35:57.438]  The manufacturing was fraudulent.
[01:35:57.698 --> 01:36:00.082]  They didn't do the production R&D required.
[01:36:00.122 --> 01:36:01.965]  It would take at least two years to do that.
[01:36:03.467 --> 01:36:06.592]  That means the regulatory authorisations were fraudulent.
[01:36:07.624 --> 01:36:17.349]  So FDA and CDC, the European Medicines Agency, the MHRA in Britain, they've all behaved fraudulently, pretty much by closing their eyes and just rubber stamping it.
[01:36:17.749 --> 01:36:23.973]  So they've not been tested, they're not safe, they don't work, they could never have worked in the elderly, and yet they are toxic.
[01:36:24.013 --> 01:36:29.996]  And then I talked at length, and I won't bore you with it again, that the very design of them could not have been more dangerous.
[01:36:30.076 --> 01:36:39.420]   They picked the only part of this Back it up ten seconds.
[01:36:40.301 --> 01:36:45.823]  The part of the virus they chose could not have been more deadly and dangerous.
[01:36:46.444 --> 01:36:46.804]  Of course!
[01:36:48.325 --> 01:36:51.946]  And then they have your body produce that, which is the most deadly part.
[01:36:53.067 --> 01:36:54.868]  In fact, the only part of the virus causing illness.
[01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:58.340]  It's power is that it's highly communicable.
[01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:01.461]  It's power is it's new so scientists see it and get scared.
[01:37:02.101 --> 01:37:05.322]  Then they give you a vaccine to counter it that isn't a vaccine.
[01:37:06.022 --> 01:37:06.322]  Continue.
[01:37:06.342 --> 01:37:08.002]  I'll bore you with it again.
[01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:11.163]  Look, the very design of them could not have been more dangerous.
[01:37:11.203 --> 01:37:17.204]  They picked the only part of this purported pathogen, the spike protein, to express in your bodies.
[01:37:17.224 --> 01:37:24.583]   Your bodies are turned into a spike protein factory, and spike proteins are definitely acutely toxic
[01:37:24.583 --> 01:37:26.623]  in loads of different ways.
[01:37:26.623 --> 01:37:31.743]   Autoimmunity, blood clots, neurological problems, impacts on fertility, and so on.
[01:37:31.743 --> 01:37:35.703]   So I've told you that they've created the impression of a scare.
[01:37:35.703 --> 01:37:39.224]   They've smashed the economy and civil society using useless measures.
[01:37:39.224 --> 01:37:45.864]   They've got you to wait for a rushed so-called vaccine that was not shown to be effective or safe,
[01:37:45.864 --> 01:37:50.903]   that never could have worked, even if the original set up about a viral threat
[01:37:50.903 --> 01:37:51.744]  was correct.
[01:37:52.066 --> 01:37:55.389]  And yet they've jabbed, I don't know, four billion, six billion poor souls.
[01:37:56.230 --> 01:37:58.191]  Something like one in a thousand people have died.
[01:37:58.832 --> 01:38:05.358]  We don't know how many more will die, but we're into double figures of millions who've definitely been killed as a consequence of this policy.
[01:38:05.798 --> 01:38:09.361]   And that tells you that the people who are doing this Bag it up!
[01:38:09.201 --> 01:38:14.640]   I'd say diabolical. We're beyond good and wrong and right, okay?
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:19.800]   We're in the good versus evil. I've not been a religious person,
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:24.400]   but I'm absolutely clear in my mind the only people, the kind of planning and thinking it
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:30.560]   takes to have done what has happened, are people who would worship Satan. They're not normal people.
[01:38:30.560 --> 01:38:35.239]   I couldn't do one part of this and continue to be alive. I'm sure I've done it.
[01:38:35.239 --> 01:38:44.360]   Back it up 25 seconds. The type of planning and work that's gone into this could only
[01:38:44.360 --> 01:38:47.480]  be done by the type of people that worship Satan.
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:57.480]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:38:51.648 --> 01:38:51.848]  Yeah.
[01:38:53.429 --> 01:38:53.849]  Bingo.
[01:38:54.269 --> 01:38:54.989]  It ain't human run.
[01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:58.770]  I can tell you I've been around the top globalists.
[01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:00.650]  Nobody's home.
[01:39:01.090 --> 01:39:02.251]  They're not running jack crap.
[01:39:02.771 --> 01:39:03.571]  They're avatars.
[01:39:05.987 --> 01:39:09.973]  James Cameron tells you in this movie, oh yeah, you think this is a person walking around?
[01:39:11.115 --> 01:39:12.336]  It's a meat puppet, folks.
[01:39:13.098 --> 01:39:14.039]  They had free will.
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:15.561]  Something came and knocked on the door.
[01:39:16.803 --> 01:39:19.046]  I'll give you some knowledge if you let me in.
[01:39:19.647 --> 01:39:19.868]  Sure.
[01:39:21.513 --> 01:39:30.263]  And then they get you to commit crimes, which moves the Holy Spirit, because when you commit crimes against children, crimes against innocents, God's transmission gets jammed.
[01:39:31.004 --> 01:39:38.933]  And as soon as that transmission, that you're not possessed by, but you're influenced by, is removed, now you're alone.
[01:39:39.313 --> 01:39:42.217]  And right then, they come in and they get your ass.
[01:39:44.619 --> 01:39:53.662]  David Icke talks about being in a BBC broadcast green room with the former British Prime Minister, who's later connected to kidnap dead children was mainstream news.
[01:39:55.163 --> 01:40:00.945]  And he's sitting there by the makeup room, having his makeup taken off, and he stands up next to David Icke, he's getting ready to go on the show.
[01:40:01.765 --> 01:40:06.847]  They're the makeup rooms, I've been in the main BBC headquarters, one that Icke's talking about, the same rooms.
[01:40:07.927 --> 01:40:15.366]   And there's makeup, there's little rooms, and the former British Prime Minister gets up And they're sitting in a room that's lit.
[01:40:16.007 --> 01:40:16.807]  He looks right at him.
[01:40:18.507 --> 01:40:21.408]  And the eyes go black, like the gate opens.
[01:40:21.608 --> 01:40:26.990]  And he goes... He scans him head to toe.
[01:40:29.210 --> 01:40:30.971]  And Ike's sitting there.
[01:40:31.011 --> 01:40:33.112]  This is what woke Ike up, was seeing stuff like this.
[01:40:33.132 --> 01:40:34.772]  He's in the BBC headquarters, folks.
[01:40:34.792 --> 01:40:38.813]  That's like the New World Order command base where these frickin' things are at.
[01:40:38.833 --> 01:40:39.994]  And yeah, it's an alien.
[01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:40.934]  He was there with an alien.
[01:40:41.755 --> 01:40:42.816]  But it was a human body.
[01:40:43.316 --> 01:40:46.958]  If you think about movies like A Flying Saucer Crashes, Little Grey Men Get Out, and all this crap, no.
[01:40:47.298 --> 01:40:49.559]  They take over your body, folks.
[01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:58.803]  But when they opened that gate up, whatever they had coming through, opened the dimension up, black space, black eyes, nothing there.
[01:40:59.123 --> 01:41:00.084]  It was an instrument.
[01:41:01.825 --> 01:41:04.726]  And it was scanning David Icke head to toe.
[01:41:08.408 --> 01:41:10.709]  And I've experienced that around Globals as well.
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:14.002]  And I've talked to other talk show hosts and people.
[01:41:14.422 --> 01:41:22.268]  I mean, he told the story, and I didn't even know the production company and who it was, because I've been involved and I've made some TV shows that was run by the same company.
[01:41:22.288 --> 01:41:27.431]  I never met with the guy, but the head of this major, it's like the number two reality TV show company in the world.
[01:41:27.471 --> 01:41:28.532]  They've been number one sometimes.
[01:41:29.393 --> 01:41:34.897]  And they call him in and they say, hey, you're going to do a show with one of the guys from Motley Crue.
[01:41:34.917 --> 01:41:36.097]  Conspiracy show.
[01:41:36.117 --> 01:41:36.838]  You've got the job.
[01:41:37.699 --> 01:41:40.581]  But all we need you to do is pledge allegiance to Lucifer.
[01:41:41.667 --> 01:41:45.149]  And Mark Dice said, well, I mean, is this a joke?
[01:41:45.169 --> 01:41:46.349]  He said, no, we really need you to do this.
[01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:48.310]  They said, I'm not going to do it.
[01:41:48.330 --> 01:41:49.271]  They said, we thought you weren't.
[01:41:49.411 --> 01:41:49.811]  You can go.
[01:41:51.352 --> 01:41:58.175]  Had the deal, had already met with the Motley Crue guy, already done shoots, everything.
[01:41:58.696 --> 01:42:01.217]  At the end of the day, they even pledged allegiance to Lucifer.
[01:42:01.617 --> 01:42:08.841]  I know another national talk show host, very well known name, who had a show as big as Howard Stern's in the mid nineties.
[01:42:09.901 --> 01:42:12.862]  And they called him into one of those meetings in LA.
[01:42:13.422 --> 01:42:14.563]  The lights were very low.
[01:42:14.583 --> 01:42:18.004]  And he goes in with this CEO in the meeting.
[01:42:19.705 --> 01:42:21.185]  And the guy's sitting there at the desk.
[01:42:25.367 --> 01:42:33.170]  And right in front of him turned into like what he would describe as a lizard with hair for just 10 seconds.
[01:42:35.148 --> 01:42:36.509]  He said, now you know who we are.
[01:42:36.529 --> 01:42:37.550]  You're going to get down on your knees.
[01:42:37.570 --> 01:42:38.371]  You're going to work with us.
[01:42:38.431 --> 01:42:39.371]  And he got up and he left.
[01:42:40.412 --> 01:42:40.993]  That's man cow.
[01:42:41.013 --> 01:42:41.633]  That happened to man cow.
[01:42:42.814 --> 01:42:45.176]  And this is real, folks.
[01:42:45.416 --> 01:42:47.958]  This is 100% real.
[01:42:48.979 --> 01:42:52.122]  In my experience, one of these global states looked at me and they said, you think you're powerful, Jones?
[01:42:52.462 --> 01:42:56.185]  Went like that and their eyes literally glowed green right there five feet from them.
[01:42:56.425 --> 01:42:57.046]  They laughed at me.
[01:42:57.906 --> 01:42:58.807]  These are aliens, folks.
[01:42:58.827 --> 01:43:00.248]  Let's get it out in the open.
[01:43:00.428 --> 01:43:00.829]  Be right back.
[01:43:02.031 --> 01:43:05.313]  Walk out tonight if there's a clear sky and look up at all those stars.
[01:43:06.214 --> 01:43:06.974]  The moon.
[01:43:07.775 --> 01:43:12.138]  Remember you're on a planet orbiting around the sun and you think we're all alone?
[01:43:13.659 --> 01:43:14.259]  Think again.
[01:43:14.299 --> 01:43:15.700]  This planet's very special.
[01:43:16.801 --> 01:43:18.082]  It's teeming with energy.
[01:43:18.942 --> 01:43:20.163]  There's a battle happening here.
[01:43:22.364 --> 01:43:24.186]  God sends his children here to be tested.
[01:43:25.667 --> 01:43:30.550]  A prison planet to make the faithful strong and the weak submit to evil.
[01:43:31.673 --> 01:43:37.876]  Yes, God gives us free will, but he puts us to the furnace to decide who will serve him on the next level.
[01:43:39.537 --> 01:43:41.799]  Don't be a fool and serve Satan.
[01:43:41.819 --> 01:43:45.561]  You can only transcend Satan by reaching out to God.
[01:43:46.601 --> 01:43:47.742]  God's hand is waiting.
[01:43:48.542 --> 01:43:50.023]  Henry in Arizona, you're on the air.
[01:43:50.083 --> 01:43:50.363]  Welcome.
[01:43:50.383 --> 01:43:50.764]  Go ahead.
[01:43:51.984 --> 01:43:52.845]  God bless you, sir.
[01:43:53.645 --> 01:43:56.407]  I just want to let you know, I used to be a minute man.
[01:43:56.447 --> 01:44:03.588]   I used to sit on the board waiting for the drugs to come over, and we thought if we popped a bag or two, We're doing good, but now we're being invaded.
[01:44:03.688 --> 01:44:05.390]  Everybody can look up to the invasion of America.
[01:44:05.410 --> 01:44:08.313]  Boy, weren't the Minutemen and the Tea Party people right warning of this?
[01:44:08.373 --> 01:44:09.114]  It's all happened now.
[01:44:09.935 --> 01:44:10.976]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:11.096 --> 01:44:16.822]  First, I just want to say we all do love you and pray for you, but I want to say a prayer because I believe in Jesus.
[01:44:17.262 --> 01:44:21.227]  In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray for Alex Jones' family and all the people in the truth of America.
[01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:29.165]  And bless this message, Lord, and bless Alex Jones and his family and that they prosper and be strong.
[01:44:29.325 --> 01:44:29.645]  Amen.
[01:44:30.466 --> 01:44:33.868]  We think that you should start the Alex Jones School of Journalism.
[01:44:33.948 --> 01:44:35.169]  Teach us all to be like you.
[01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:37.851]  It would be nice to have 10,000 Alex Jones.
[01:44:38.291 --> 01:44:46.757]  Well, it would be good to have a school of journalism because I'm not that good, and I've been truthful, but I've made a lot of mistakes, so I could definitely teach people the ins and outs and how stuff really works.
[01:44:46.837 --> 01:44:51.641]  If I had the energy, the time, the money, and the wherewithal, it would be great to have a school of journalism.
[01:44:51.661 --> 01:44:52.302]  That's a great idea.
[01:44:52.322 --> 01:44:55.584]  We need a thousand Alex Jones, but let's get right to it.
[01:44:55.623 --> 01:45:02.523]   Brian Terry was a friend of mine and Brian Terry was murdered by narco cartel traffickers.
[01:45:02.523 --> 01:45:08.123]   And what's going on right now down here in Arizona is they want Arizona.
[01:45:08.123 --> 01:45:09.123]  They're trying to take Arizona.
[01:45:09.123 --> 01:45:13.083]   But we're going to I want to make a sworn statement that any judge, anybody can have
[01:45:13.083 --> 01:45:18.962]   FBI sworn statement and all truth and the truth of God right here on air.
[01:45:18.962 --> 01:45:23.043]   The feds got a little junk car out by our ranch that they're scanning.
[01:45:23.043 --> 01:45:24.043]  They're spying on us.
[01:45:24.043 --> 01:45:25.043]  But we know they're there.
[01:45:25.043 --> 01:45:26.643]  So here's the deal.
[01:45:26.643 --> 01:45:32.323]  Adrian Fontes is running for secretary of state.
[01:45:32.323 --> 01:45:34.644]  He's actually a cartel member from Senola cartel.
[01:45:34.644 --> 01:45:37.202]  He's never even born in America.
[01:45:37.202 --> 01:45:39.202]  Well, I don't know about y'all guys.
[01:45:38.248 --> 01:45:38.988]  I don't really know.
[01:45:39.808 --> 01:45:44.469]  But I do know, in Austin, they busted the mayor's brother running a safe out with kidnapped people in it.
[01:45:44.489 --> 01:45:45.470]  They were torturing him for money.
[01:45:45.870 --> 01:45:50.491]  So, yes, many of the so-called leaders you see are actually cartel leaders.
[01:45:51.328 --> 01:45:52.988]  Yeah, well, he is actually 100%.
[01:45:53.248 --> 01:45:57.349]  Adrian Fontes, who's running for Secretary of State, is nothing but a defense attorney.
[01:45:57.409 --> 01:46:00.390]  He helped the guys that killed Brian Terry.
[01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:01.270]  Well, that's what I found.
[01:46:01.370 --> 01:46:07.532]  It's liberal immigration lawyers and defense lawyers are actually the leaders of the cartel arm in the U.S.
[01:46:08.452 --> 01:46:10.372]  And Hector Sanchez Barba.
[01:46:10.572 --> 01:46:17.954]  He's the head of the World Planned Parenthood, and he's running Mi Familia Vota that also infects Texas.
[01:46:18.266 --> 01:46:24.266]   And he's, Mi Familia Vota injected a lot of votes into the election that totally offset
[01:46:24.266 --> 01:46:25.266]  the election.
[01:46:25.266 --> 01:46:31.506]   Now, he also is responsible for a lot of the organ harvesting that's been going on.
[01:46:31.506 --> 01:46:37.746]   And they have testimony, sworn testimony already on record where they stuffed dead babies'
[01:46:37.746 --> 01:46:39.666]  bodies with drugs.
[01:46:39.666 --> 01:46:41.626]  Hector Sanchez Barba and Mi Familia.
[01:46:41.413 --> 01:46:44.773]   vote that needs to be shut down right now and subtract those votes.
[01:46:44.773 --> 01:46:45.773]  I appreciate your call.
[01:46:45.773 --> 01:46:49.252]   I don't really know those names, those people, but I know that stuff goes on.
[01:46:49.252 --> 01:46:50.252]  But I appreciate your call.
[01:46:50.252 --> 01:46:51.252]  Send me some information.
[01:46:51.252 --> 01:46:52.252]  Jordan in Florida, you're on the air.
[01:46:52.252 --> 01:46:53.252]  Go ahead.
[01:46:53.252 --> 01:46:54.252]  Hey, how are you, Alex?
[01:46:54.252 --> 01:46:55.252]  I'm all right, brother.
[01:46:55.252 --> 01:46:56.252]  Go ahead.
[01:46:56.252 --> 01:47:01.612]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about the FTX scandal a little bit.
[01:47:01.612 --> 01:47:06.413]   I feel like that's really the smoking gun going on with the Democrats, with the money laundering.
[01:47:06.428 --> 01:47:10.489]  I feel like that could blow this whole thing wide open and put a lot of the New World Order behind bars.
[01:47:10.849 --> 01:47:15.990]  Oh, I think Sam Bankman Fried is going to be Epstein.
[01:47:16.030 --> 01:47:17.210]  He's even got Epstein's lawyer.
[01:47:19.011 --> 01:47:25.752]  Yeah, I think he needs to be like really, really kept a close eye on because I seriously feel like this is a smoking gun.
[01:47:25.792 --> 01:47:32.053]  I mean, you know, and most of that goes by the media not covering him so much, not covering this whole thing.
[01:47:32.645 --> 01:47:35.746]  The lack of media coverage is what really sets a red flag off in my head.
[01:47:36.607 --> 01:47:38.088]  Uh, you know.
[01:47:38.108 --> 01:47:38.488]  No, I agree.
[01:47:38.508 --> 01:47:40.028]  They've been really burying that, haven't they?
[01:47:42.750 --> 01:47:43.390]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:47:44.030 --> 01:47:46.472]  Well, he was supposed to testify by Congress, but he got arrested.
[01:47:50.713 --> 01:47:51.434]  I didn't hang up on you.
[01:47:51.454 --> 01:47:52.154]  I appreciate your call.
[01:47:52.534 --> 01:47:53.455]  Jefferson in Virginia.
[01:47:53.495 --> 01:47:53.795]  Go ahead.
[01:47:53.815 --> 01:47:57.417]  Hey, Alex Jones.
[01:47:57.777 --> 01:47:58.037]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:59.998 --> 01:48:05.302]  Earlier you were talking about the tyranny and how the minions were going to go along with the tyranny and they were going to pay for it because they're going to get killed off.
[01:48:05.662 --> 01:48:09.905]  But we live in a very strange time where they can kill almost everybody they want to.
[01:48:10.305 --> 01:48:11.466]  Brzezinski told us this.
[01:48:11.546 --> 01:48:15.248]  It's easier to kill a million people now than it is to convince them to go your way.
[01:48:15.388 --> 01:48:15.648]  That's right.
[01:48:15.668 --> 01:48:17.149]  He told, in fact guys, pull that up.
[01:48:17.430 --> 01:48:18.530]  It's about 10 years ago.
[01:48:19.531 --> 01:48:28.537]  Zbigniew Brzezinski tells Canadian CFR, or just Brzezinski says it's easier to kill a million people than to control a million people, is a quote.
[01:48:30.478 --> 01:48:30.838]  Correct.
[01:48:31.178 --> 01:48:32.978]  And that means they're going for broke here.
[01:48:33.018 --> 01:48:37.139]  They will hit us with everything they have to to win this war.
[01:48:37.919 --> 01:48:40.260]  There's no chivalry left in this battle.
[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:41.500]  They are going to go for broke.
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:46.581]  They will hit us with EMP weapons of our own to shut down our system if they want to.
[01:48:46.721 --> 01:48:46.981]  I agree.
[01:48:47.001 --> 01:48:47.961]  The sky's the limit.
[01:48:47.981 --> 01:48:48.761]  They'll blame it on Russia.
[01:48:49.861 --> 01:48:50.361]  Right.
[01:48:50.841 --> 01:48:52.062]  So they think they're going to win.
[01:48:52.082 --> 01:48:56.022]  They're going to get away with it so that the people that are going along with it think they'll be the elect.
[01:48:56.182 --> 01:49:11.872]   They'll be the selected people that get to dodge the bullet and then They'll be able to use these suppressed technologies to rebuild the world the way they want it to be, and use the robots and the AI to run things, and they'll never think twice about us.
[01:49:12.532 --> 01:49:13.692]  I agree.
[01:49:13.732 --> 01:49:15.313]  So what do we do, Jefferson?
[01:49:17.133 --> 01:49:19.373]  Well, we have to figure out what their Achilles heel is.
[01:49:19.433 --> 01:49:20.774]  What is their one weakness?
[01:49:21.254 --> 01:49:23.554]  What's the one thing that makes them pause?
[01:49:23.794 --> 01:49:25.694]  It's the same thing that makes us pause.
[01:49:26.935 --> 01:49:27.935]  What about their children?
[01:49:28.055 --> 01:49:29.155]  What about their progeny?
[01:49:30.618 --> 01:49:34.821]  How can we make them wonder about whether they're going to be able to continue living?
[01:49:34.841 --> 01:49:40.564]  A lot of Republicans are saying we should ballot harvest and cheat now, and that's how to beat them, but then we just become them.
[01:49:40.745 --> 01:49:50.371]  But yeah, but imagine, I mean, I just, the problem is if you take out the top 50 globalists, they've got more scum behind them.
[01:49:50.391 --> 01:49:52.852]  I think we have to kill their ideas.
[01:49:53.493 --> 01:49:59.737]  That's why you need them to confess to what they're doing, and you can convince them to confess in a number of different ways.
[01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:02.512]  But, you know, you have to think about it from your terms.
[01:50:02.772 --> 01:50:04.674]  What's the one thing that would make you stop fighting?
[01:50:05.034 --> 01:50:06.195]  If they had a hold of your kids?
[01:50:06.535 --> 01:50:07.576]  Nope, wouldn't make me stop.
[01:50:08.617 --> 01:50:10.499]  Well, would they start sending body parts to you?
[01:50:12.961 --> 01:50:14.542]  Well, they're dead already by then, aren't they?
[01:50:15.423 --> 01:50:16.924]  We're going to lose them all anyways.
[01:50:20.868 --> 01:50:25.792]  So you're saying go out and kidnap globalist children and cut their fingers off and mail it to them in the mail?
[01:50:27.006 --> 01:50:28.747]  I'm saying that's what it's going to boil down to.
[01:50:28.767 --> 01:50:40.252]  We're going to have to bite the bullet here and figure out that if we're not willing to ask for God's forgiveness for having done what we needed to do, if we're worried about our souls, then what we should be worried about is winning.
[01:50:40.933 --> 01:50:46.435]  There's a funny line in the West Wing, Toby Ziegler used to say, they'll love us after we win.
[01:50:47.716 --> 01:50:50.817]  You have to stop worrying about how you win because they don't care how they win.
[01:50:51.818 --> 01:50:52.938]  They broke the rules first.
[01:50:53.199 --> 01:50:55.900]  But don't you see how the devil wins by getting them to break the rules and we do?
[01:50:57.445 --> 01:50:59.847]  Well, we're allowed to ask for forgiveness for anything we do.
[01:50:59.867 --> 01:51:00.868]  All right.
[01:51:00.988 --> 01:51:08.393]  Listen, I appreciate your call, but I do not want to kidnap globalist children and cut their fingers off and mail it to them.
[01:51:10.215 --> 01:51:13.977]  I'd rather wake up the globalist children and have them join us.
[01:51:15.238 --> 01:51:17.840]  But the world they've created is where we're going.
[01:51:18.541 --> 01:51:22.383]  And so they'll hurt enough people or what you're saying is going to happen, but I don't support it.
[01:51:23.624 --> 01:51:24.365]  That's where we're going.
[01:51:26.618 --> 01:51:27.218]  God help us.
[01:51:29.220 --> 01:51:29.540]  Yeah.
[01:51:30.641 --> 01:51:32.022]  Far like Carlos and others.
[01:51:32.042 --> 01:51:33.283]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:51:34.004 --> 01:51:36.726]  On the other side, these calls are hardcore.
[01:51:38.487 --> 01:51:42.911]  I don't tell this story to brag or toot our horn, but to let you know how effective we've been over the years.
[01:51:46.733 --> 01:51:52.458]  Matt Bellamy of Muse was already number one rock star at the time, 13, 14 years ago, and I learned he was a listener.
[01:51:52.478 --> 01:51:53.539]  He was wearing InfoWars shirts.
[01:51:55.100 --> 01:51:55.560]  On air.
[01:51:56.181 --> 01:51:56.921]  On concerts.
[01:51:57.702 --> 01:52:04.025]  And so he came to Austin, and we met once, and he was on the show a few times, and they came after him and said, we're gonna destroy you if you don't do it.
[01:52:04.045 --> 01:52:06.867]  So he came out and said, well, I don't believe those views anymore.
[01:52:06.887 --> 01:52:07.467]  I've grown up.
[01:52:07.487 --> 01:52:09.369]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:52:09.429 --> 01:52:15.752]  Those songs he put out that were number one, a whole bunch of them, were directly inspired by this broadcast and by you supporting the broadcast.
[01:52:16.153 --> 01:52:21.576]  And that's how many things, just so many cultural things we look at, were influenced by InfoWars.
[01:52:22.851 --> 01:52:24.232]  And had huge effects.
[01:52:24.512 --> 01:52:26.152]  And all of you have that power as well.
[01:52:26.192 --> 01:52:28.573]  You just don't know how powerful you are.
[01:52:29.573 --> 01:52:34.455]  And sometimes the effects we had really weren't even that political.
[01:52:36.716 --> 01:52:40.157]  That's when I learned the power of persuasion, the power of what we do.
[01:52:40.177 --> 01:52:45.298]  Even jokes I did and things I covered that I wasn't thinking was having any effect had the biggest effects.
[01:52:46.199 --> 01:52:48.359]  When I met Mike Judge, we're good friends many, many years ago.
[01:52:48.379 --> 01:52:50.260]  I've known Mike now.
[01:52:52.025 --> 01:52:53.146]  Personally, more than a decade.
[01:52:53.166 --> 01:52:56.428]  And I met with him a few times.
[01:52:56.448 --> 01:52:57.209]  We had dinner a few times.
[01:52:57.249 --> 01:52:58.249]  He said, hey, come by my house.
[01:52:58.270 --> 01:52:59.610]  I want to show you something.
[01:52:59.630 --> 01:53:05.415]  He had the old VHS tapes of him in the mid-1990s when he was first riding King of the Hill after he was abutted.
[01:53:05.935 --> 01:53:18.064]  And he said, did you know that you and two other guys off AXS TV and people I grew up around in Garland outside Dallas are the influence of Hank Hill and Dale Gribble and the other guy?
[01:53:18.695 --> 01:53:22.158]  You see the episodes of the American flag with the gold fringe and the conspiracies and all that.
[01:53:22.518 --> 01:53:23.279]  And that was me!
[01:53:23.859 --> 01:53:25.620]  And he goes, oh look, I influence King of the Hill.
[01:53:25.921 --> 01:53:27.842]  No, I didn't influence King of the Hill.
[01:53:28.062 --> 01:53:31.305]  I'm one third of the influence in those characters.
[01:53:31.505 --> 01:53:32.246]  That's massive.
[01:53:32.406 --> 01:53:33.727]  And he gave us an interview and said that.
[01:53:34.688 --> 01:53:42.790]   Remember, I told one of my friends, Pat Riley, About 8-9 years ago when I first met him, he was talking about how much he loved Mike Judge.
[01:53:43.450 --> 01:53:46.553]  And I said, yeah, did you know that I'm one of the main influences of King of the Hill?
[01:53:46.593 --> 01:53:50.077]  And he goes, okay, I've known you, I know you're in talk shows, I think you're crazy.
[01:53:50.477 --> 01:53:52.259]  I said, here, I just did the interview a month ago with him.
[01:53:52.559 --> 01:53:58.725]  He watched the interview, was totally blown away, and I said, the next day I said, hey, I'm going out to Mike Judge's ranch north of Austin to do some shooting.
[01:53:58.745 --> 01:54:02.008]  And it was when they were starting, about the start of a year before they started.
[01:54:03.737 --> 01:54:07.500]  Silicon Valley with this was a whole cast of Silicon Valley out there.
[01:54:08.281 --> 01:54:09.201]  He was just like, really?
[01:54:09.242 --> 01:54:10.743]  I said, yeah, let me take you to meet my judge.
[01:54:11.343 --> 01:54:21.952]  But the point is, is that people don't recognize greatness when they see it, especially when it's so friendly and, you know, right up front and just just talking to folks.
[01:54:21.992 --> 01:54:35.384]   So I don't tell those stories to say, oh, aren't we impressive when I tell you the Mark Dice's story about them trying to pledge himself to Lucifer before he got his contract for a national TV show.
[01:54:35.444 --> 01:54:35.864]  That happened.
[01:54:36.804 --> 01:54:38.685]  He told me privately about it two years before he went public.
[01:54:39.426 --> 01:54:48.490]  When I tell you about the story he's told on air about David Icke, it's real, I believe him, because I've seen something very similar.
[01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:53.032]  And it's like, I'm at the point of like, do I tell them this because it sounds so crazy?
[01:54:54.473 --> 01:54:55.653]  It's the truth, so I'm just going to tell you.
[01:54:56.213 --> 01:54:57.194]  There's even more, folks.
[01:54:57.927 --> 01:55:00.952]  So, once you're connected to God, the veil opens.
[01:55:02.014 --> 01:55:04.477]  And once you're connected to Satan, it opens as well, but different veil.
[01:55:05.188 --> 01:55:08.849]  They have knowledge of evil, knowledge of Satan, knowledge of this whole thing going on.
[01:55:09.469 --> 01:55:15.291]  We open up the veil to God, and God opens the veil to us, and we see so much more than even Satan can see.
[01:55:15.611 --> 01:55:17.592]  But let me tell you, it's going to be wild.
[01:55:18.232 --> 01:55:19.393]  You really get the Holy Spirit.
[01:55:19.413 --> 01:55:21.233]  You're not going to dream once a week.
[01:55:21.273 --> 01:55:26.095]  You're not going to dream during REM sleep when you've been asleep seven hours for the last half hour of sleep.
[01:55:26.455 --> 01:55:29.016]  You're going to dream for eight hours straight like I do.
[01:55:29.952 --> 01:55:31.773]  I went to bed at 10 o'clock last night.
[01:55:32.233 --> 01:55:36.174]  Woke up at midnight after this dream, after a dream, after a dream.
[01:55:36.554 --> 01:55:37.635]  Lifetimes of dreams.
[01:55:37.715 --> 01:55:38.695]  Incredible dreams.
[01:55:39.575 --> 01:55:42.436]  I got up, got some water, took a piss, went back to bed.
[01:55:43.497 --> 01:55:45.057]  Three more hours of non-stop dreams.
[01:55:45.497 --> 01:55:46.278]  Went back to sleep.
[01:55:46.338 --> 01:55:47.438]  Woke up at 5 a.m.
[01:55:47.498 --> 01:55:50.119]  I said, I want to see some more of this, baby.
[01:55:50.179 --> 01:55:51.879]  I went back to sleep until 7 a.m.
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:56.001]  And I had adventures you couldn't imagine.
[01:55:56.361 --> 01:55:58.902]  Didn't have those dreams until I got lined up with God.
[01:56:00.714 --> 01:56:02.475]  So there's a lot going on while we're asleep.
[01:56:02.956 --> 01:56:05.338]  Scientists now confirm what the ancient mystics told us.
[01:56:05.978 --> 01:56:10.762]  Our brain can go into higher dimensions, full space, go different places, you name it.
[01:56:11.863 --> 01:56:13.664]  Not just work through problems of the subconscious.
[01:56:14.124 --> 01:56:17.967]  And when you are connected to God, man, it's incredible.
[01:56:18.708 --> 01:56:26.154]  And so just what I get in my dream life is worth being lined up at a firing squad and shot.
[01:56:27.287 --> 01:56:29.550]  Because I get that third eye being open.
[01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:31.312]  And I saw a clip I was going to play Sunday.
[01:56:31.332 --> 01:56:32.573]  Will you guys queue it up and I'll go back to calls?
[01:56:33.154 --> 01:56:35.036]  If you can find about the third eye, it's like two minutes long.
[01:56:36.057 --> 01:56:38.280]  And it's an individual talking about Pinocchio.
[01:56:39.304 --> 01:56:44.765]  On the archetype of the pineal gland, which is 100% true in the allegory of Pinocchio.
[01:56:45.345 --> 01:56:48.086]  And I saw a lot of the comments on Twitter saying, this guy's an occultist.
[01:56:48.486 --> 01:56:49.686]  Don't open your third eye.
[01:56:50.026 --> 01:56:51.286]  You're going to go to hell if you do it.
[01:56:51.666 --> 01:56:54.767]  No, opening your third eye means you become spiritually connected.
[01:56:55.147 --> 01:56:57.347]  Yes, if you're already into evil, it'll become worse for you.
[01:56:57.367 --> 01:56:58.587]  You're already connected to God.
[01:56:58.647 --> 01:56:59.407]  That's what happens.
[01:57:00.388 --> 01:57:01.628]  And I meant to show it yesterday.
[01:57:01.668 --> 01:57:03.008]  You guys, if you could find it on Twitter.
[01:57:04.828 --> 01:57:08.429]  The Argentinian team won the game.
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:11.561]  You know, the big World Cup.
[01:57:12.362 --> 01:57:19.889]  And the captain of the team put his hands up like this, all five fingers out, like, yay, we're winning.
[01:57:20.570 --> 01:57:29.859]  And he held the trophy like this, two fingers with his other fingers out, with his finger like that.
[01:57:30.831 --> 01:57:34.514]  And all the fake Pharisee Christians said, look, it's Bathomet.
[01:57:34.995 --> 01:57:36.236]  He's giving a Bathomet symbol.
[01:57:36.576 --> 01:57:42.382]  Even when I give you an example of it, they'll grab clips of me and say, here's Jones giving the Bathomet symbol.
[01:57:42.862 --> 01:57:45.524]  But that's not what the head of the Argentinian team was doing.
[01:57:45.805 --> 01:57:50.169]  He was holding a trophy and had his fingers out excited, holding the trophy.
[01:57:51.607 --> 01:57:56.429]  So, a swastika on a Buddhist temple is not a Nazi swastika.
[01:57:57.190 --> 01:58:00.711]  Or if I go, hey, everything's okay, that's the symbol of okay.
[01:58:00.991 --> 01:58:04.573]  Doesn't mean just because the Illuminati uses that, it's the intention that matters.
[01:58:04.613 --> 01:58:05.614]  It's what you mean by it.
[01:58:06.034 --> 01:58:07.875]  Every symbol we've got, God gave us.
[01:58:08.695 --> 01:58:11.056]  And it's been expropriated by the enemy.
[01:58:13.097 --> 01:58:16.479]  So the Satanists don't want you to open your third eye.
[01:58:17.662 --> 01:58:19.963]  Unless they've got full control of you, then they can use that.
[01:58:20.403 --> 01:58:22.844]  But God, the Holy Spirit, will open your throat.
[01:58:22.864 --> 01:58:23.444]  You guys found it.
[01:58:23.464 --> 01:58:25.845]  Look at that.
[01:58:25.865 --> 01:58:27.626]  Oh, look at the Argentinian captain.
[01:58:27.986 --> 01:58:28.787]  He's batting them out.
[01:58:28.847 --> 01:58:29.227]  No, he's not.
[01:58:29.267 --> 01:58:35.129]  He's holding a trophy and puts his fingers out.
[01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:41.712]  That's evil to accuse somebody that's done nothing of being a Satanist when it turns out that guy's a Christian.
[01:58:41.732 --> 01:58:42.172]  I looked it up.
[01:58:43.533 --> 01:58:46.414]  No, holding a trophy and putting your two fingers out is not satanic.
[01:58:46.794 --> 01:58:56.098]  And I've given many examples where I go, when people do the UT symbol, which is the hook them horns, that's not satanic, that means a cow.
[01:58:57.819 --> 01:59:02.041]  And when I do that, the people that attack me, the fake Christians, they go, look, Jones is doing Hell's Satan.
[01:59:02.281 --> 01:59:04.342]  No, I'm educating people of what the symbol means.
[01:59:07.185 --> 01:59:09.627]  It's like the I love you symbols like that.
[01:59:09.947 --> 01:59:11.068]  So Bolsonaro did that.
[01:59:11.328 --> 01:59:12.889]  People said, oh, Bolsonaro's a Satanist.
[01:59:12.969 --> 01:59:13.269]  Oh, really?
[01:59:13.489 --> 01:59:14.430]  Just a tree by the fruit.
[01:59:14.971 --> 01:59:16.992]  Attack the real Satanists that are out in the open.
[01:59:17.212 --> 01:59:18.233]  Here's the clip on Pinocchio.
[01:59:20.916 --> 01:59:22.718]  Pineal gland is the third eye.
[01:59:23.018 --> 01:59:31.366]  When you read the story of Pinocchio, Pinocchio has two words, pine, P-I-N, pineal gland, and occhio is occhiola.
[01:59:31.747 --> 01:59:33.488]  Occhio, in Italian, is eye.
[01:59:33.508 --> 01:59:35.831]  That's why you go to an oculist.
[01:59:36.311 --> 01:59:40.055]  So Pinocchio means the pineal gland.
[01:59:40.495 --> 01:59:42.977]   Pinocchio He's a puppet.
[01:59:43.157 --> 01:59:44.197]  He's not a real person.
[01:59:44.537 --> 01:59:49.159]  In order to become a real person, to ascend, you have to activate your corneal gland.
[01:59:49.199 --> 01:59:51.100]  You have to stop telling lies.
[01:59:51.501 --> 01:59:53.641]  You have to stop being deceived by your friends.
[01:59:53.702 --> 01:59:59.144]  You have to stop going to the circuses and the shows, as all the philosophers have ever said.
[01:59:59.524 --> 02:00:03.670]  Getting drunk, intoxicated with drugs and to be sober.
[02:00:04.251 --> 02:00:09.678]  So the pineal gland is the third eye and it's our highest consciousness.
[02:00:09.959 --> 02:00:15.306]  If you want to be real, just read the story of Pinocchio and activate your Pinocchio.
[02:00:16.443 --> 02:00:21.246]  And so he's telling you, don't use drugs, connect to God, and so people go, oh my gosh, this is a devil worshiper, third eye!
[02:00:21.326 --> 02:00:29.110]  No, the fluoride attacks it in scientific studies, the pineal gland's real, it's directly connected to higher dimensional and higher brain waves in the body.
[02:00:30.070 --> 02:00:31.711]  And iodine directly clears that out.
[02:00:32.091 --> 02:00:36.474]  That's why they take it out of the food, take it out of the salt, take, strip it, because then you're a zombie.
[02:00:37.874 --> 02:00:38.995]  They know what they're doing.
[02:00:41.309 --> 02:00:44.571]  All right, we're going to go to break, come back with Carlos, everybody else, I promise.
[02:00:44.631 --> 02:00:45.491]  Bam, bam, bam.
[02:00:45.511 --> 02:00:49.253]  I'll get to every one of your calls before I punch out of here and the guest host takes over.

[02:02:26.665 --> 02:02:27.685]  I think that's a typo.

[02:02:35.952 --> 02:02:36.672]  Okay, that's a typo.
[02:02:36.732 --> 02:02:40.015]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Carlos in Canada.
[02:02:40.055 --> 02:02:40.975]  Carlos, you're on the air.
[02:02:41.015 --> 02:02:41.296]  Welcome.
[02:02:42.136 --> 02:02:42.577]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:02:43.692 --> 02:02:47.494]  I want to talk about Ukraine and, if possible, about Zelensky.
[02:02:49.114 --> 02:03:04.100]  The Russian military philosopher, Clausewitz, said clearly that the aim of the commander is to destroy the military equipment of the enemy, not to seize real estate.
[02:03:04.881 --> 02:03:13.284]  And with that dictum, I have noticed only three analysts that really have understood the Russian approach to the military operation.
[02:03:13.932 --> 02:03:16.613]  One was, I'm of course, Robert Barnes.
[02:03:17.513 --> 02:03:23.855]  I agreed with him 100% because I had been thinking, why are the Russians parked just outside Kiev doing nothing?
[02:03:24.335 --> 02:03:37.419]  You know, what the idea was, was to have the attention focused on the taking of the capital, while from two other sides, they were taking the south, and they were taking part of the Donbass back.
[02:03:38.081 --> 02:03:44.363]  Then they move the troops towards... Carlos, we know that was the plan, but the Russians are up against NATO in the U.S.
[02:03:44.804 --> 02:03:46.384]  and are having incredible losses.
[02:03:46.424 --> 02:03:48.785]  Even Putin admits this is much harder than they thought.
[02:03:49.746 --> 02:03:54.907]  Well, of course, because the Russians never expected to be fighting a proxy war with NATO.
[02:03:55.268 --> 02:03:59.569]  They never wanted to declare war against Russia, against Ukraine.
[02:03:59.609 --> 02:04:01.370]  It was basically a military operation.
[02:04:01.835 --> 02:04:07.579]  And another thing people don't understand is that Putin is not an absolute dictator.
[02:04:07.899 --> 02:04:10.460]  He has limits upon what he can use.
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:16.584]  He was given permission to engage in a conventional military operation, but not to declare war on Ukraine.
[02:04:16.824 --> 02:04:21.567]  That was something totally out of the order, and there have been no reason for it.
[02:04:21.969 --> 02:04:31.415]  The only thing that's left for Russia to do is just to keep cool, to keep doing what they're doing, destroying the military equipment, to set a perimeter of security.
[02:04:31.436 --> 02:04:34.478]  Sure, why do you think they blew up another Russian pipeline yesterday?
[02:04:34.498 --> 02:04:37.019]  Why is NATO cutting the gas off to Europe?
[02:04:37.340 --> 02:04:42.983]  I guess just so they have no other choice but to fight Russia because Russia then can't use the leverage of the pipelines over them?
[02:04:43.924 --> 02:04:51.423]   No, because Israel is coming in from the south With LNG, and it was the plan from... Well, no, you're right.
[02:04:51.463 --> 02:04:56.064]  And they just turned on, the day that the pipeline was blown up, that new Northern Europe pipeline.
[02:04:57.044 --> 02:04:57.484]  Exactly.
[02:04:57.864 --> 02:04:59.345]  So that's the whole point, right?
[02:04:59.765 --> 02:05:16.409]   And so what you're going to be seeing from now on is, and people should understand when they see Zelensky talking to the government of the United States, is that he's using the money from the United States and the HIMARS equipment to kill civilians, because they're using it to shoot Let's talk to Paul in Texas.
[02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:18.969]  the Donbass that have no military application.
[02:05:18.969 --> 02:05:19.969]  No, no, no.
[02:05:19.969 --> 02:05:23.849]   Zelensky's a dictator, he's committing war crimes, he's banned the major, oldest church
[02:05:23.849 --> 02:05:25.889]  in the country, it's outrageous.
[02:05:25.889 --> 02:05:26.889]  And the man is a dictator.
[02:05:26.889 --> 02:05:30.809]   He banned all political parties with his, including leftists that supported him.
[02:05:30.809 --> 02:05:32.689]  I mean, that is a dictator.
[02:05:32.689 --> 02:05:34.768]  We are now supporting a dictator in this war.
[02:05:34.768 --> 02:05:35.768]  It is shameful.
[02:05:35.768 --> 02:05:36.768]  Thank you, Carlos.
[02:05:36.768 --> 02:05:38.088]  Let's talk to Paul in Texas.
[02:05:38.088 --> 02:05:39.088]  You're on the air.
[02:05:39.088 --> 02:05:43.268]   Yeah, Alex, I want to start off by saying I appreciate what you're doing for freedom
[02:05:43.268 --> 02:05:44.568]  of speech in this country.
[02:05:44.545 --> 02:05:46.828]  As an American, I value this most.
[02:05:47.028 --> 02:05:48.910]  It is our greatest gift.
[02:05:51.279 --> 02:05:54.622]  Well, since you thanked me, let me just say this now, and I'm going to let you talk, and I appreciate you calling.
[02:05:55.322 --> 02:05:56.583]  I'm in the jaws of this.
[02:05:57.064 --> 02:06:00.767]  I knew we were all in the jaws of it, so I've been fighting for my life because I knew this was coming.
[02:06:01.087 --> 02:06:03.829]  But now, sir, I don't have a choice but to fight with everything I've got.
[02:06:04.469 --> 02:06:09.093]  They are literally trying to destroy me and my family and my crew right now, so thank you.
[02:06:09.113 --> 02:06:14.017]  But understand now, I'm fully committed to the fight, and I can only win this with your help, so please help me.
[02:06:14.037 --> 02:06:14.918]  I'm just telling you.
[02:06:16.199 --> 02:06:19.882]  I'm a very desperate person, just like we all are once we realize where we're at.
[02:06:19.902 --> 02:06:20.622]  But thank you, sir.
[02:06:21.703 --> 02:06:24.746]  Well, I really appreciate what you're doing, and we're definitely supporting you.
[02:06:25.927 --> 02:06:29.870]  I have friends who are Democrats, friends who are Republicans, and friends who are independent.
[02:06:30.330 --> 02:06:33.513]  And the one thing that all of my friends have in common is we're Americans.
[02:06:34.374 --> 02:06:35.475]  Oh, I should say two things.
[02:06:35.515 --> 02:06:38.097]  We're Americans, and we believe in freedom of speech.
[02:06:38.918 --> 02:06:41.800]  And the word that falls into that line is liberal.
[02:06:42.645 --> 02:06:48.492]  There are Republicans who are liberal, there are independents who are liberal, and there are Democrats that are liberal.
[02:06:48.812 --> 02:06:51.255]  The far left are not liberal.
[02:06:51.856 --> 02:06:54.599]  They don't believe in an exchange of ideas.
[02:06:54.619 --> 02:06:57.443]  They are authoritarian, really communist fascists.
[02:06:58.244 --> 02:06:58.825]  Exactly.
[02:06:58.885 --> 02:06:59.966]  They are suppressionists.
[02:07:00.658 --> 02:07:06.444]  I don't want to get on your case about this, but I wish in the future you'd quit calling them liberals.
[02:07:06.844 --> 02:07:07.905]  Call them suppressionists.
[02:07:07.925 --> 02:07:09.607]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:07:10.127 --> 02:07:14.972]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal for more freedom, more food, more money, more guns, more personal autonomy.
[02:07:15.272 --> 02:07:17.934]  A classical liberal is a conservative today.
[02:07:18.915 --> 02:07:21.477]  We're trying to conserve our classical liberal values.
[02:07:21.497 --> 02:07:21.917]  You're right.
[02:07:22.237 --> 02:07:23.558]  I just use the terms the public knows.
[02:07:23.978 --> 02:07:29.261]  These are authoritarian French Revolution neo-communist tyrants.
[02:07:29.321 --> 02:07:30.261]  They are suppressionists.
[02:07:30.621 --> 02:07:31.582]  They are control freaks.
[02:07:31.602 --> 02:07:32.502]  They are a power cult.
[02:07:35.004 --> 02:07:44.629]  George Orwell, before he died, who'd worked at the top of OSS and MI6, their head propagandist, number two in the whole agency, said, there is no left and right.
[02:07:44.649 --> 02:07:46.930]  There's only a power cult that wants to rule the people.
[02:07:48.240 --> 02:07:48.761]  Exactly.
[02:07:49.762 --> 02:07:54.749]  I believe the first thing we should do in our fight is strip them of their mask.
[02:07:55.570 --> 02:07:57.032]  Stop calling them liberals.
[02:07:57.633 --> 02:07:58.815]  Take away that false...
[02:08:03.081 --> 02:08:03.521]  Exactly.
[02:08:03.581 --> 02:08:03.882]  Exactly.
[02:08:03.762 --> 02:08:07.121]   them liberals the crew needs to get in my ear they don't do this but I wanted to
[02:08:07.121 --> 02:08:11.282]   do you're right they are not liberals liberal means more freedom not lock
[02:08:11.282 --> 02:08:16.762]   downs and four shots liberal means more money not less not oh you'll own nothing
[02:08:16.762 --> 02:08:20.321]   and have nothing and like it exactly Klaus Schwab's not a liberal he is a
[02:08:20.321 --> 02:08:27.562]   evil control freak that wants to suppress us exactly exactly and Pelosi
[02:08:27.562 --> 02:08:34.542]   and shift and the others they're just suppressionist They want to suppress our freedom.
[02:08:34.582 --> 02:08:35.923]  They want to suppress our freedom.
[02:08:36.203 --> 02:08:39.946]  You know, people have the term, you know, be tolerant.
[02:08:40.446 --> 02:08:41.847]  Well, I am tolerant.
[02:08:41.887 --> 02:08:42.988]  They're not tolerant of us.
[02:08:45.110 --> 02:08:47.091]  And they're trying to change our vocabulary.
[02:08:47.191 --> 02:08:48.552]  Words no longer mean anything.
[02:08:48.572 --> 02:08:50.814]  Well, the new thing officially is don't say the word American.
[02:08:51.774 --> 02:08:51.954]  Yeah.
[02:08:53.115 --> 02:08:54.616]  Don't say the word American.
[02:08:54.736 --> 02:08:57.138]  Liberal does not mean... In fact, I'm putting a t-shirt out.
[02:08:57.859 --> 02:08:58.999]  T-shirts are coming back soon.
[02:08:59.480 --> 02:09:01.121]  It's going to say American.
[02:09:01.141 --> 02:09:02.222]  InfoWars.com.
[02:09:03.402 --> 02:09:03.722]  All right.
[02:09:04.002 --> 02:09:04.402]  Great.
[02:09:05.202 --> 02:09:05.523]  Great.
[02:09:05.763 --> 02:09:06.283]  Way to go.
[02:09:06.443 --> 02:09:07.523]  Let me tell you, I appreciate your call.
[02:09:07.963 --> 02:09:14.845]  I went to a event in, when was it?
[02:09:14.885 --> 02:09:16.585]  It was about three years ago.
[02:09:17.525 --> 02:09:21.206]  And it was called Donald Trump, Alex Jones, and Fake News.
[02:09:21.246 --> 02:09:24.067]  And they shut down downtown, part of Congress Street.
[02:09:24.107 --> 02:09:25.407]  And they had my name up there and everything.
[02:09:25.768 --> 02:09:28.988]  And I show up at a free event with thousands of people who try to throw me out.
[02:09:29.228 --> 02:09:29.889]  We have video of it.
[02:09:34.540 --> 02:09:38.782]  I go ahead and get up there where they can hear me on the mic and I say, we're all Americans.
[02:09:38.822 --> 02:09:39.862]  Let's come together.
[02:09:39.903 --> 02:09:40.323]  Let's stop.
[02:09:40.463 --> 02:09:48.346]  And they went, when I said American, it was like high noon to vampires or you know, you turn the lights on the cockroaches run.
[02:09:48.386 --> 02:09:52.688]  They went, ah, they hate us having a country.
[02:09:52.969 --> 02:09:54.329]  They hate what the country stands for.
[02:09:54.349 --> 02:09:55.510]  They're trying to usurp it.
[02:09:57.871 --> 02:09:58.531]  That's why I love it.
[02:09:58.571 --> 02:10:10.615]   The great movie, uh, by, uh, Whatever his name is that made Escape from New York and so many other great movies like The Thing, John Carpenter, who was a classical liberal, and he's still alive I guess, but John Carpenter.
[02:10:11.036 --> 02:10:17.203]  They got Snake Plissken about to send him into New York and they go, Snake Plissken, American, Lieutenant, Special Forces.
[02:10:17.783 --> 02:10:19.966]  But the whole point is, is they go, American.
[02:10:20.266 --> 02:10:23.589]  And it's the way Lee Van Cleef says, Snake Plissken, American.
[02:10:24.290 --> 02:10:30.173]  And at the end of the day, that's what we are, and that's what we stand for, and what that term, American, stands for.
[02:10:30.533 --> 02:10:34.835]  Classical liberalism, freedom, and justice is standing up for the little people.
[02:10:34.855 --> 02:10:39.377]  I just want to say one thing about American, or about Alex Jones, it's American.
[02:10:40.097 --> 02:10:41.378]  I want to be known as American.
[02:10:41.998 --> 02:10:43.779]  I loved it when Trump would call me the Texan.
[02:10:45.619 --> 02:10:47.241]  And Roger said, yeah, he calls you the Texan.
[02:10:47.261 --> 02:10:48.702]  They talk about you all the time in the White House, blah, blah, blah.
[02:10:48.722 --> 02:10:50.963]  And Trump would call me and he goes, how's that Texan doing?
[02:10:51.364 --> 02:10:56.127]  Because out of the whole pantheon of America, I kind of see Texas as special just because some of its story had passed.
[02:10:56.147 --> 02:11:00.030]  But yeah, it's just we're blessed to be there with our past.
[02:11:00.070 --> 02:11:02.592]  We've got to reinvigorate it and bring it forward and make something better with it.
[02:11:02.812 --> 02:11:03.573]  I'm going to shut up now.
[02:11:04.413 --> 02:11:08.416]  But InfoWars, Alex Jones, his crew, his audience, American.
[02:11:09.397 --> 02:11:10.037]  American.
[02:11:10.057 --> 02:11:12.359]  InfoWars is American.
[02:11:12.880 --> 02:11:13.940]  We'll be right back.
[02:11:13.779 --> 02:11:26.679]  Stay with us.
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:35.263]  It's a secret weapon for your immune system, for your stamina, for your energy, for your way of life, for your libido, and it also keeps InfoWars on the air.
[02:11:35.543 --> 02:11:45.087]  And I almost forgot, you save at least 50% on these products for what you'd pay for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[02:11:45.347 --> 02:11:50.129]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation that supplies some of the top names.
[02:11:50.549 --> 02:11:55.771]   They then give us the best deal out there, because the owner's a listener, We're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[02:11:55.931 --> 02:12:00.893]  You're not going to find 1,000 milligram high-quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[02:12:01.113 --> 02:12:03.375]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram, or the 20 milligram.
[02:12:03.495 --> 02:12:07.096]  You're not going to find turmeric at 95% humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[02:12:07.256 --> 02:12:09.657]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[02:12:09.918 --> 02:12:15.540]  These similar formulas, or the same formulas, sell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[02:12:16.020 --> 02:12:20.142]  InfoWars MD, now available exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:12:20.382 --> 02:12:21.063]  A true 360 win.
[02:12:23.936 --> 02:12:25.117]  Snake Plissken.
[02:12:26.018 --> 02:12:26.658]  American.
[02:12:26.678 --> 02:12:28.420]  Infowars.
[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:29.220]  American.
[02:12:29.921 --> 02:12:30.862]  Bart in Georgia.
[02:12:31.142 --> 02:12:31.842]  American.
[02:12:32.323 --> 02:12:33.504]  On Replacement Migration.
[02:12:33.704 --> 02:12:34.324]  In our face.
[02:12:34.364 --> 02:12:34.885]  Go ahead, Bart.
[02:12:36.630 --> 02:12:37.210]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:37.330 --> 02:12:46.415]  I want to start off with I just ordered the HGH Max Boost last night in the middle of the night and I look forward to it coming and I got one more thing.
[02:12:46.455 --> 02:12:47.896]  It was a 360 win.
[02:12:47.936 --> 02:12:52.658]  If you guys would go and subscribe to Bart Fine on Bitchute and Rumble.
[02:12:52.718 --> 02:12:55.960]  I put up Alex Jones and Infowars broadcasts every day.
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:12:57.100]  Beautiful.
[02:12:57.161 --> 02:12:57.801]  Say it again.
[02:12:57.861 --> 02:12:58.942]  Another live feed to share.
[02:12:58.982 --> 02:12:59.922]  And why are these important?
[02:13:00.322 --> 02:13:02.764]  They censor the InfoWars feeds and the Band Up video feeds.
[02:13:03.064 --> 02:13:19.394]  But all the great listeners that are syndicating our feeds, in fact, I meant to mobilize you guys, and we should plug these and create a list, though they'll use that to blacklist it, of all the people restreaming our feeds, so you can share those on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, on your Instagram, on your email, and not get censored.
[02:13:19.414 --> 02:13:21.255]  It's a censoring email too, folks, especially Google.
[02:13:21.656 --> 02:13:23.537]  Tell people how they found the feed of the show.
[02:13:24.901 --> 02:13:34.904]  Yes, you go to Rumble, subscribe to Bart Fine, and then the same thing on Bitchute, and I've got some derelict channels on YouTube, but I'm pretty much bam there on that comedy channel.
[02:13:35.164 --> 02:13:36.544]  So Bart Fine?
[02:13:37.545 --> 02:13:40.185]  Yes, F-I-N-E, Bart, like Bart Simpson.
[02:13:40.305 --> 02:13:42.326]  Everybody should get that link and share it now.
[02:13:42.426 --> 02:13:43.426]  Will that save the world?
[02:13:43.486 --> 02:13:45.467]  No, but resistance together will.
[02:13:45.527 --> 02:13:46.207]  Beautiful, go ahead.
[02:13:47.347 --> 02:13:52.110]  Anyway, I want to go about how delusional and ignorant the third world has been dumbed down.
[02:13:52.150 --> 02:13:52.911]  I'll give you an example.
[02:13:52.951 --> 02:14:00.135]  I was, unfortunately, I married one of these women from the third world and we had a child and I told her, you need to put our baby in a car seat.
[02:14:00.235 --> 02:14:01.556]  And she said, why?
[02:14:02.056 --> 02:14:04.057]  And we couldn't even find one in the Philippines.
[02:14:04.077 --> 02:14:06.119]  They don't even sell, they don't even protect their children.
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:10.802]  Well, the thing is nothing against the third world.
[02:14:10.922 --> 02:14:12.523]  It's just that they have no history of freedom.
[02:14:12.923 --> 02:14:16.185]  That's why the globalists have done the sociological actuaries and want to bring them here.
[02:14:18.143 --> 02:14:18.504]  Yes, sir.
[02:14:18.524 --> 02:14:19.648]  They've been dumbed down.
[02:14:20.269 --> 02:14:21.012]  Let's explain it.
[02:14:21.052 --> 02:14:21.633]  Let's explain it.
[02:14:22.957 --> 02:14:23.639]  Argentina...
[02:14:24.750 --> 02:14:27.851]  And Brazil, 50 years ago, were as good as America.
[02:14:28.651 --> 02:14:29.651]  So was Venezuela.
[02:14:30.171 --> 02:14:35.233]  Mexico is still the most civilized, richest country in Latin America, and it's way below the U.S.
[02:14:35.853 --> 02:14:37.113]  And they're a failed society.
[02:14:37.133 --> 02:14:38.474]  We're about to be as well, not putting them down.
[02:14:38.874 --> 02:14:39.454]  But exactly.
[02:14:39.514 --> 02:14:50.077]  You bring people in, though, from the worst Latin American countries, it is like my dad's done work down there, free medical work and stuff, in places, you know, in South America, and it is just, it's scary as hell.
[02:14:50.457 --> 02:14:51.737]  And people don't know what we're importing.
[02:14:54.062 --> 02:14:55.883]  Yeah, where is this Governor Abbott?
[02:14:55.903 --> 02:14:57.604]  He's doing nothing but talk.
[02:14:58.985 --> 02:15:01.306]  Well at least he's finally talking about criminal charges.
[02:15:01.626 --> 02:15:05.509]  You can't have a UN NGO that ran the collapse of Europe for 10 years.
[02:15:06.289 --> 02:15:06.810]  I've been there.
[02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:07.450]  I've shown video.
[02:15:07.670 --> 02:15:09.171]  They command the Border Patrol.
[02:15:09.751 --> 02:15:10.612]  SJWs.
[02:15:11.052 --> 02:15:12.593]  Tell the Border Patrol what to do, brother.
[02:15:13.945 --> 02:15:16.406]  Yeah, we need to talk about seceding from the Union now.
[02:15:16.446 --> 02:15:18.146]  There's maybe no other choice there.
[02:15:18.386 --> 02:15:20.827]  Well, I agree with that, but not to secede and get rid of the Union.
[02:15:20.847 --> 02:15:27.928]  We could have a state compact pull out and say the government's occupied and peacefully then reconstitute the Republic by the states.
[02:15:27.988 --> 02:15:30.169]  That's how it happened in the beginning with the colonies.
[02:15:30.189 --> 02:15:30.949]  That's how it should happen.
[02:15:32.629 --> 02:15:33.950]  Yeah, one last thing I want to say.
[02:15:33.970 --> 02:15:38.731]  Arrest Dr. Fauci and Bill Gates and the list goes on and on and on, y'all.
[02:15:40.871 --> 02:15:41.555]  Arrest all of them.
[02:15:41.615 --> 02:15:42.138]  Thank you, Bart.
[02:15:42.580 --> 02:15:44.912]  All right, this is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:15:46.295 --> 02:15:53.980]  Cindy and Mark and Chris and Herbert and John, we're going right to your calls and then Kate Daly in about 10-12 minutes.
[02:15:54.421 --> 02:15:55.601]  She's going to be taking over.
[02:15:55.641 --> 02:16:01.345]  She always has amazing guests, always has incredible information, but she knows a lot of times I steal 10-15 minutes of her show.
[02:16:02.486 --> 02:16:05.068]  So we always love having a guest host that'll host the last part of the show.
[02:16:05.468 --> 02:16:07.329]  That's coming up straight ahead.
[02:16:07.910 --> 02:16:09.771]  And there's a lot of news I didn't get to, but that's okay.
[02:16:09.791 --> 02:16:14.054]  I got prepared, I got ready, but I love your calls and I think the listeners like it.
[02:16:15.453 --> 02:16:20.097]  In fact, I don't do on air what I think will get us the biggest listenership, but we do get bigger listenership when I take calls.
[02:16:20.757 --> 02:16:22.318]  They like callers better than guests.
[02:16:22.338 --> 02:16:30.104]  They like callers better than me, and so do I, because you bring up so many great angles, so thought-provoking, so amazing, and it's just another microcosm.
[02:16:31.285 --> 02:16:37.289]  We can get the general public motivated and engage politically, culturally, economically, spiritually.
[02:16:38.931 --> 02:16:40.051]  It's game over, the new world order.
[02:16:41.052 --> 02:16:41.813]  All right, folks.
[02:16:43.251 --> 02:16:43.852]  He's dangerous, sir.
[02:16:43.872 --> 02:16:44.332]  I know.
[02:16:44.171 --> 02:16:50.171]   right back to your calls. Punch George Soros non-violently in the nose. Share the links
[02:16:50.171 --> 02:16:56.971]   to Infowars.com. Punch the globalist right in the gut, politically, non-violently. Share
[02:16:56.971 --> 02:16:57.971]  Bandon video.
[02:16:57.971 --> 02:17:23.610]   He's dangerous, sir. I know. I'll be okay. I'm not a fool, Plissken.
[02:17:24.388 --> 02:17:26.388]  Call me Snake.
[02:17:30.992 --> 02:17:31.472]  Plissken.
[02:17:32.893 --> 02:17:33.353]  American.
[02:17:33.413 --> 02:17:33.953]  Lieutenant.
[02:17:33.973 --> 02:17:35.794]  Special Forces Unit Black Blight.
[02:17:36.815 --> 02:17:37.555]  Two Purple Hearts.
[02:17:37.595 --> 02:17:38.836]  Leningrad and Siberia.
[02:17:39.176 --> 02:17:41.257]  Youngest man to be decorated by the President.
[02:17:43.178 --> 02:17:45.039]  You robbed the Federal Reserve Depository.
[02:17:45.319 --> 02:17:45.959]  Life sentence.
[02:17:46.059 --> 02:17:48.120]  New York Maximum Security Penitentiary.
[02:17:48.740 --> 02:17:51.941]  I'm ready to kick your ass out of the world, war hero.
[02:17:51.941 --> 02:18:07.341]  Who are you?
[02:18:07.914 --> 02:18:08.254]  Houck.
[02:18:09.435 --> 02:18:10.095]  Police Commissioner.
[02:18:11.856 --> 02:18:12.476]  Bob Houck.
[02:18:14.037 --> 02:18:15.778]  Special Forces Unit, Texas Thunder.
[02:18:16.579 --> 02:18:17.499]  We heard of you too, Plissken.
[02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:19.360]  Why are we talking?
[02:18:19.921 --> 02:18:21.342]  I have a deal for you.
[02:18:23.403 --> 02:18:26.625]  You receive full pardon for every criminal action you've committed in the United States.
[02:18:28.125 --> 02:18:30.207]  There was an accident about an hour ago.
[02:18:30.227 --> 02:18:32.248]  A small jet went down inside New York City.
[02:18:32.668 --> 02:18:33.889]  The President was on board.
[02:18:35.455 --> 02:18:36.216]  President of what?
[02:18:37.276 --> 02:18:38.337]  That's not funny, Plissken.
[02:18:39.678 --> 02:18:43.882]  You go in, find the president, bring him out in 24 hours, and you're a free man.
[02:18:43.902 --> 02:18:45.083]  24 hours, huh?
[02:18:45.803 --> 02:18:46.624]  I'm making you an offer.
[02:18:46.904 --> 02:18:47.524]  Bullshit.
[02:18:47.925 --> 02:18:48.926]  Straight, just like I said.
[02:18:49.226 --> 02:18:49.966]  I'll think about it.
[02:18:50.327 --> 02:18:50.767]  No time.
[02:18:51.227 --> 02:18:51.768]  Give me an answer.
[02:18:52.308 --> 02:18:53.249]  Get a new president.
[02:18:54.230 --> 02:18:55.491]  We're still at war, Plissken.
[02:18:56.271 --> 02:18:56.992]  We need him alive.
[02:18:57.012 --> 02:18:59.254]  I don't give a fuck about your war.
[02:19:00.555 --> 02:19:01.415]  Or your president.
[02:19:03.157 --> 02:19:03.777]  Is that your answer?
[02:19:04.077 --> 02:19:04.698]  I'm thinking about it.
[02:19:04.947 --> 02:19:05.947]  Think hard.
[02:19:05.947 --> 02:19:14.947]  Why me?
[02:19:15.459 --> 02:19:17.101]  You flew the Gulf Fire over Leningrad.
[02:19:17.601 --> 02:19:18.683]  You know how to get in quiet.
[02:19:19.223 --> 02:19:19.744]  You're all I've got.
[02:19:21.986 --> 02:19:23.588]  I guess I go in one way or the other.
[02:19:23.608 --> 02:19:26.711]  Doesn't mean shit to me.
[02:19:26.550 --> 02:19:28.550]  Hey, give me the paper.
[02:19:28.550 --> 02:19:30.550]  When you come in.
[02:19:30.550 --> 02:19:34.550]  John in California.
[02:19:34.438 --> 02:19:35.599]  You're on the air worldwide.
[02:19:35.619 --> 02:19:36.240]  Thanks for calling.
[02:19:36.260 --> 02:19:36.660]  Go ahead.
[02:19:38.482 --> 02:19:39.142]  Thank you.
[02:19:39.683 --> 02:19:51.132]  You know, there's a bunch of young men out there who are totally just killing it with their own talk shows.
[02:19:52.093 --> 02:19:54.515]  I think he called in yesterday, BMS talk show.
[02:19:55.716 --> 02:19:56.537]  I looked him up.
[02:19:56.997 --> 02:19:57.938]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:19:58.339 --> 02:20:02.380]   You are a Alex, you are an influence for everyone.
[02:20:02.660 --> 02:20:06.163]  You know what, I might even start my own podcast out there.
[02:20:06.483 --> 02:20:08.505]  I mean, no one wants to really listen to me, you know.
[02:20:08.525 --> 02:20:09.846]  No, they do want to listen to you, brother.
[02:20:09.966 --> 02:20:10.287]  Do it.
[02:20:10.647 --> 02:20:12.749]  Whether a hundred listeners or a million, it's all a victory.
[02:20:14.570 --> 02:20:15.031]  Thank you.
[02:20:15.291 --> 02:20:18.013]  You know, he was saying he wants to get you on as a guest.
[02:20:18.634 --> 02:20:20.135]  He wants to be on your show as a guest.
[02:20:20.255 --> 02:20:22.157]  I think you maybe look into that.
[02:20:22.618 --> 02:20:25.540]  But anyways, I wanted to talk about the immigration.
[02:20:26.061 --> 02:20:31.439]   You know, Back in my day, we didn't really have a whole issue, a whole lot of problems.
[02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:33.861]  Them hopping the border, coming across.
[02:20:34.342 --> 02:20:46.311]  You know, my neighbors, they keep parking in front of my house, and I guarantee you, I mean, he looks African-American, but I guarantee you, he is probably from Mexico, and probably illegal.
[02:20:46.331 --> 02:20:47.672]  He doesn't speak collective English.
[02:20:47.812 --> 02:20:49.374]  Well, there's people coming from all over the world.
[02:20:49.434 --> 02:20:51.395]  Yeah, they're breaking the border to break the country.
[02:20:52.816 --> 02:20:53.617]  Absolutely.
[02:20:54.209 --> 02:21:04.774]  You know, we need a stronger border, and if people aren't signing up to be in the border protection, then maybe we should create some type of draft to secure the border.
[02:21:04.935 --> 02:21:05.415]  No, I hear you.
[02:21:05.435 --> 02:21:08.016]  The problem is, John, the U.N.
[02:21:08.056 --> 02:21:10.798]  is in control through Biden of our border patrol.
[02:21:10.838 --> 02:21:12.799]  They're being ordered to do this, but I agree with you.
[02:21:13.099 --> 02:21:13.639]  Thank you, sir.
[02:21:14.139 --> 02:21:15.620]  Mark in New Jersey, go ahead.
[02:21:17.361 --> 02:21:17.761]  Alex.
[02:21:18.161 --> 02:21:18.481]  Yes, sir.
[02:21:18.521 --> 02:21:20.042]  Merry Christmas to you and the crew.
[02:21:20.062 --> 02:21:21.363]  Thanks for everything.
[02:21:23.789 --> 02:21:35.173]  Talk a little bit about FTX, and one of the callers earlier kind of stole my thunder a little bit with FTX, but I do think it's the thread on the sweater.
[02:21:36.153 --> 02:21:41.034]  If we keep pulling on it, it's the easiest track to follow the money back to the flues.
[02:21:43.357 --> 02:21:49.541]  Alex, the thing that's so disheartening about it too is, you know, it's a clown show.
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:52.580]   Yeah, they're not even hiding it. Congress won't even do an investigation on where the money's going.
[02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:57.779]   There's no monitoring of $150 billion, and now Zelensky wants more than $45 billion.
[02:21:57.779 --> 02:22:02.920]   He's demanding $100 billion today from Congress, like he's our master.
[02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:07.739]   Alex, the thing that's so disheartening about it, too, is, you know, it's a clown show.
[02:22:07.739 --> 02:22:12.579]   I mean, they put this boozer, the clown guy up there. You know, he doesn't know anything.
[02:22:12.577 --> 02:22:15.358]  They're doing their accounting with QuickBooks.
[02:22:15.398 --> 02:22:16.538]  They don't have a CPA.
[02:22:16.558 --> 02:22:26.060]  I mean, anybody in their right mind who doesn't question this and realize this was a bald-faced, money-laundering operation.
[02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:28.801]  The country is being looted seven ways this Sunday.
[02:22:29.641 --> 02:22:31.741]  I mean, we should be taken to the streets here.
[02:22:32.621 --> 02:22:41.043]  And the Republicans are just as culpable here, because when was the last person who went to prison in this country?
[02:22:42.510 --> 02:22:49.533]  No one goes to jail.
[02:22:49.673 --> 02:22:50.774]  Look at Lois Lerner.
[02:22:50.794 --> 02:22:51.554]  We go back to that.
[02:22:51.974 --> 02:22:59.597]  Big emails setting up Republicans to be persecuted through a tax agency.
[02:23:01.963 --> 02:23:05.304]  She never faced any more than a... We're going to ask a couple questions.
[02:23:05.404 --> 02:23:06.645]  The Republicans are going to ask questions.
[02:23:06.665 --> 02:23:10.347]  And now Biden's gearing up with his 70-something thousand new agents to do it again.
[02:23:10.367 --> 02:23:11.667]  Incredible points, Mark.
[02:23:11.707 --> 02:23:12.147]  Thank you.
[02:23:12.848 --> 02:23:15.289]  Cindy in Arizona, you're on the air.
[02:23:15.309 --> 02:23:18.350]  Hey, Alex.
[02:23:18.410 --> 02:23:19.670]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:23:19.771 --> 02:23:30.255]  I've been a listener since the late 90s, and I'm hoping to make history today by being the first woman to do the Alex Jones Warrior Scream, and here's what I've got to say.
[02:23:33.136 --> 02:23:38.183]  Get your hands off my kid, you miserable, demonic slug!
[02:23:38.784 --> 02:23:44.171]  It'll be over my dead body before you get your hands on my children, you understand?
[02:23:45.350 --> 02:23:46.070]  There you go!
[02:23:46.090 --> 02:23:47.732]  I'm angry!
[02:23:47.752 --> 02:23:52.074]  You women need to get some warrior blood in you!
[02:23:52.095 --> 02:23:52.175]  Yeah!
[02:23:52.575 --> 02:23:54.116]  You women!
[02:23:54.436 --> 02:24:01.701]  Get your heads off my kids and grandkids or I will beat you to death wherever I see you!
[02:24:01.721 --> 02:24:06.904]  I agree, we should get all these lettuce events and not attack them but just go, just scream at them.
[02:24:06.924 --> 02:24:08.906]  Just say, they're just like, oh my gosh.
[02:24:09.952 --> 02:24:14.153]  I've been listening to you for a long time and I've never heard a woman do that, this time!
[02:24:14.173 --> 02:24:14.754]  No, you're right.
[02:24:14.794 --> 02:24:17.475]  A woman calls in with InfoWars Battle Call.
[02:24:17.695 --> 02:24:19.515]  Is that right?
[02:24:19.575 --> 02:24:20.276]  Let me tell ya!
[02:24:20.636 --> 02:24:23.297]  Let me tell you how I turned my whole neighborhood onto you.
[02:24:23.357 --> 02:24:38.702]  I just moved to Arizona from scumbag Seattle about a year ago and the first time I went out in my backyard when it was hot and I have a swimming pool, I put my little Bluetooth out there and I had your show on and I had it on loud because I wanted to hear it.
[02:24:39.608 --> 02:24:42.289]  And I thought, man, am I being rude to my neighbors?
[02:24:42.970 --> 02:24:44.490]  And I thought, hell no.
[02:24:44.991 --> 02:24:48.532]  I'm going to red pill my neighbors right now.
[02:24:49.292 --> 02:24:52.094]  I kept that Bluetooth on as loud as I could get it.
[02:24:52.454 --> 02:24:53.174]  And you know what?
[02:24:53.995 --> 02:24:59.417]  The very next day, one of my neighbors came over and said, hey, you listen to what I listen to.
[02:24:59.937 --> 02:25:01.078]  So we became buds.
[02:25:01.738 --> 02:25:13.259]   I kept it up and I had three people come to my front door and within two weeks and say, Hey, I can't quite catch it all, but every now and then I catch something you're listening to.
[02:25:13.299 --> 02:25:14.739]  What are you listening to?
[02:25:15.299 --> 02:25:17.260]  And I totally band videoed them.
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:20.061]  And it's a great thing.
[02:25:20.481 --> 02:25:22.302]  I will continue to do the work.
[02:25:22.402 --> 02:25:28.624]  And the key is, tell them now to blare it, and then their neighbors will blare it, and their neighbors will blare it.
[02:25:28.864 --> 02:25:30.944]  And that is the chain reaction.
[02:25:32.105 --> 02:25:32.545]  Exactly.
[02:25:32.585 --> 02:25:35.946]  I'm hoping by the end of this summer, we'll have a neighborhood meeting.
[02:25:37.432 --> 02:25:37.792]  I love it.
[02:25:37.812 --> 02:25:40.573]  Well, just tell your neighbors to start blaring it so the next neighbor gets it.
[02:25:40.893 --> 02:25:42.394]  And of course you get that chain reaction.
[02:25:42.414 --> 02:25:42.634]  Absolutely.
[02:25:43.534 --> 02:25:46.575]  Yeah, they won't be able to get away with it unless they move out.
[02:25:47.715 --> 02:25:48.115]  Beautiful.
[02:25:48.135 --> 02:25:48.876]  Anything else, Cindy?
[02:25:49.236 --> 02:25:50.176]  I love you, Alex.
[02:25:51.216 --> 02:25:53.697]  Your whole crew, you are doing such a service.
[02:25:54.397 --> 02:25:55.197]  And you know what?
[02:25:55.257 --> 02:25:55.938]  I'm a fighter.
[02:25:56.038 --> 02:25:57.238]  I have never given up.
[02:25:57.318 --> 02:25:58.559]  I'm 61 years old.
[02:25:58.699 --> 02:25:59.999]  I will never, ever.
[02:26:00.976 --> 02:26:02.196]  Give up on our freedom.
[02:26:02.256 --> 02:26:05.818]  You're beautiful and you're amazing and everybody can get the word out.
[02:26:05.838 --> 02:26:10.299]  There's a lot of other great shows as well, but Infowars.com forward slash show and Bandai Video.
[02:26:10.679 --> 02:26:11.940]  So thank you so much, Cindy.
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:13.640]  Thank you so much and God bless you.
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:15.481]  All right, Chris, I'm out of time.
[02:26:15.561 --> 02:26:16.381]  Get Chris's name and number.
[02:26:16.401 --> 02:26:17.582]  I'll call him back tomorrow on the live show.
[02:26:17.962 --> 02:26:18.902]  Been doing a good job at that.
[02:26:19.302 --> 02:26:21.344]  But Kate Dally is taking over right now.
[02:26:21.384 --> 02:26:22.245]  She's loaded for bear.
[02:26:22.265 --> 02:26:23.646]  Everybody tune in now.
[02:26:23.746 --> 02:26:25.928]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:26:25.968 --> 02:26:32.274]  And then in about 45 minutes from now, the great Owen Troyer with The War Room, the original War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:26:32.314 --> 02:26:32.714]  Central.
[02:26:33.094 --> 02:26:35.557]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:26:35.577 --> 02:26:36.257]  Share that link.
[02:26:36.317 --> 02:26:39.120]  We'll be right back with Kate Dally on the other side.
[02:26:40.043 --> 02:26:41.624]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:41.684 --> 02:26:43.044]  So glad to be here with you today.
[02:26:43.104 --> 02:26:45.945]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:26:46.426 --> 02:26:48.826]  A couple of things to say before I bring on my guest.
[02:26:49.167 --> 02:26:55.349]  After 12 years of studying government, 10 to 12 hours a day, I know it's not for the faint of heart, that's for sure.
[02:26:55.369 --> 02:26:58.150]  I can tell you I'm pretty cynical.
[02:26:58.350 --> 02:26:59.451]  I'm really cynical actually.
[02:27:00.151 --> 02:27:05.693]  Probably the worst cynical person you'll ever meet because I know that not a lot's going to change and it's all theater.
[02:27:06.329 --> 02:27:07.570]  Nuremberg isn't going to happen.
[02:27:07.711 --> 02:27:08.732]  Hague isn't going to happen.
[02:27:08.772 --> 02:27:10.373]  Nuremberg isn't even law in this country.
[02:27:10.754 --> 02:27:11.034]  Okay?
[02:27:11.294 --> 02:27:15.419]  Lots of emails floating around with hope, but they're not going to do anything.
[02:27:15.599 --> 02:27:15.859]  Okay?
[02:27:16.440 --> 02:27:17.521]  Elon is a distraction.
[02:27:17.561 --> 02:27:18.682]  He's always been part of the club.
[02:27:18.942 --> 02:27:20.484]  He's not going to deliver free speech.
[02:27:20.524 --> 02:27:24.849]  He's not going to deliver what we need him to deliver because he works for him.
[02:27:25.229 --> 02:27:28.152]  Twitter has always been funded by the government and owned by the government.
[02:27:28.472 --> 02:27:28.893]  It's a fact.
[02:27:29.642 --> 02:27:31.724]  So same with Facebook and all of them, okay?
[02:27:32.225 --> 02:27:35.968]  And so I know that the left is trying to destroy this country.
[02:27:36.508 --> 02:27:40.772]  I know that the rhinos in this country are sort of going along with it, right?
[02:27:40.872 --> 02:27:42.514]  And not really stopping anything.
[02:27:42.794 --> 02:27:45.917]  In fact, sometimes actively destroying the country too.
[02:27:45.937 --> 02:27:47.459]  It just really depends on the issue.
[02:27:48.099 --> 02:27:48.820]  But here's the deal.
[02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:53.144]  I kind of jokingly refer to the Republican Party as a bra.
[02:27:53.344 --> 02:27:55.066]  I know, I said it, as a bra, okay?
[02:27:56.494 --> 02:28:00.355]  Because they don't ever change anything too drastically, if you know what I mean.
[02:28:00.675 --> 02:28:02.775]  But they always hold the boobs in place, okay?
[02:28:03.176 --> 02:28:09.897]  And so, these boobs are in Congress and the Senate, and they always will be, and fraud will deliver them there.
[02:28:10.537 --> 02:28:11.717]  And that's a problem for us.
[02:28:11.877 --> 02:28:18.299]  The Republicans and all of the Dems, some Republicans, some RINOs, they did nothing when it came to election fraud.
[02:28:19.019 --> 02:28:19.320]  Nothing.
[02:28:19.641 --> 02:28:19.961]  Okay?
[02:28:20.443 --> 02:28:22.367]  In fact, they kind of actively squashed it.
[02:28:22.909 --> 02:28:27.600]  This case is about those individuals who said no to an investigation.
[02:28:27.861 --> 02:28:28.502]  Just said no.
[02:28:29.184 --> 02:28:30.525]  To a simple investigation.
[02:28:30.565 --> 02:28:33.007]  And if you have a crime, you're going to investigate that crime, right?
[02:28:33.127 --> 02:28:34.448]  To find out if there was a crime.
[02:28:34.908 --> 02:28:35.929]  They actually said no.
[02:28:36.490 --> 02:28:44.075]  This case with Loy Brunson is really fascinating because the date is suddenly approaching and I want to talk about some of the miracles.
[02:28:44.315 --> 02:28:49.879]  I'm usually very pessimistic, kind of cynical, really cynical about the goings on or the things that could help us.
[02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:57.966]  This wouldn't save us, but it would certainly change things for us if we were willing to learn a lot and take those things and do something with them.
[02:28:58.186 --> 02:28:58.406]  Okay?
[02:28:59.073 --> 02:29:00.734]  And so let's bring on Loy Brunson.
[02:29:00.794 --> 02:29:04.356]  He and his brothers are, I think you'll remember the trumpeteers, right?
[02:29:04.716 --> 02:29:11.901]  The trumpeters from the Brunson Brothers who actually provide entertainment nationally on a lot of national stages.
[02:29:11.941 --> 02:29:16.363]  I'm so happy to have Loy with me because he has a fascinating case.
[02:29:16.644 --> 02:29:18.305]  You're going to want to pay attention to this one.
[02:29:18.625 --> 02:29:27.310]  Like I said, the date is quietly approaching, but he's suing, he and his brothers are suing 388 members of the Senate, the Congress, and of course, King Frodelot and Hormala.
[02:29:27.330 --> 02:29:28.531]  You know I can't call her anything else.
[02:29:29.672 --> 02:29:34.336]  And this case, even though you might go, I don't know if that would actually happen.
[02:29:34.836 --> 02:29:36.798]  Just wait till you hear the details of this case.
[02:29:36.818 --> 02:29:39.380]  That's what got me really intrigued about this.
[02:29:39.480 --> 02:29:40.161]  Welcome, Loy.
[02:29:40.181 --> 02:29:40.581]  How are you?
[02:29:41.962 --> 02:29:42.563]  I'm doing great.
[02:29:42.603 --> 02:29:42.903]  Thanks.
[02:29:43.163 --> 02:29:44.044]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:29:45.145 --> 02:29:45.785]  Incredible.
[02:29:45.845 --> 02:29:53.632]  So you're suing 388 members, including the fraudulent presidency, and you're suing them for violating their oath.
[02:29:53.772 --> 02:29:54.553]  Talk about this case.
[02:29:56.132 --> 02:29:59.594]  Yeah, well, people need to understand, first of all, the power of this case is what you said.
[02:29:59.634 --> 02:30:04.476]  This is probably the first, probably the most powerful case in front of the Supreme Court ever.
[02:30:05.296 --> 02:30:14.541]  We filed under Rule 11 of the Supreme Court, which characterized, the court characterized it as an emergency case, or they wouldn't have let it move forward without the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decision.
[02:30:15.495 --> 02:30:22.861]  But so the power that they have with this case is like you said, they literally have the power to completely adjudicate the whole complaint.
[02:30:23.021 --> 02:30:27.784]  Most cases in front of the Supreme Court are upholding a decision or reversing a decision.
[02:30:27.825 --> 02:30:29.005]  This is completely different.
[02:30:29.686 --> 02:30:37.052]  This actually gives the Supreme Court the power to remove, as you said, to remove from office 385 current members of the U.S.
[02:30:37.072 --> 02:30:37.792]  House and U.S.
[02:30:37.832 --> 02:30:45.338]  Senate, a sitting president and vice president, and hold them, actually bar them from holding public office the rest of their lives.
[02:30:45.700 --> 02:30:50.206]  Including Mike Pence, who is not holding office right now.
[02:30:51.447 --> 02:30:55.773]  So that's the power of the case.
[02:30:56.614 --> 02:30:59.898]  There are some unique things that have happened to this case.
[02:30:59.998 --> 02:31:04.564]  First of all, a Rule 11 petition has never been docketed successfully, which ours has been docketed.
[02:31:05.143 --> 02:31:08.004]  With the Supreme Court since probably the 70s.
[02:31:08.384 --> 02:31:09.824]  And it was the government, U.S.
[02:31:09.844 --> 02:31:14.065]  government brought a case against someone having to do with the Nixon administration.
[02:31:14.125 --> 02:31:16.625]  So someone checked, an attorney checked the docket.
[02:31:16.645 --> 02:31:18.366]  He thinks he might have seen one other.
[02:31:18.426 --> 02:31:24.087]  So first of all, having a docketed case under Rule 11 is unheard of.
[02:31:24.647 --> 02:31:25.747]  And that's what they accepted.
[02:31:25.847 --> 02:31:30.468]  But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, I think, found out about this and they hurried and made a decision.
[02:31:30.488 --> 02:31:31.549]  I can kind of tell you the story.
[02:31:31.569 --> 02:31:33.489]  I'm kind of getting ahead of the story if you want.
[02:31:34.234 --> 02:31:36.807]  Should I kind of start from the beginning and explain how...
[02:31:38.999 --> 02:31:53.666]  You took on this case and you said, and I think the thing that intrigued me so much about this was that the Supreme Court reached out to him several times to help him bypass the lower courts to be able to get one of the two cases that were filed.
[02:31:53.686 --> 02:31:56.507]  That was a brilliant move, by the way, because one was going to make it, right?
[02:31:56.767 --> 02:31:57.948]  At least one of those cases.
[02:31:57.988 --> 02:31:58.888]  So brilliant move.
[02:31:59.169 --> 02:32:05.732]  But the Supreme Court reached out to you to make sure that this got on the docket to be able to get a hearing.
[02:32:05.872 --> 02:32:08.173]  It is almost impossible to get a case this far.
[02:32:09.589 --> 02:32:19.312]  And so that to me was really, really shocking about this case and I want people to really think about that for a moment because that could either go very, very good in my eyes or very, very bad, right?
[02:32:19.332 --> 02:32:22.732]  We all think of set-ups, we think of January 6th set-ups and all those kinds of things.
[02:32:23.093 --> 02:32:25.153]  But they could have just let this die, right?
[02:32:25.593 --> 02:32:28.634]  They wanted to make sure that this got in their purview.
[02:32:30.345 --> 02:32:33.186]  Yeah, so we were stuck in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals with the second one.
[02:32:33.206 --> 02:32:35.506]  The first one got stuck in federal court.
[02:32:36.086 --> 02:32:37.967]  The federal court actually ordered the U.S.
[02:32:38.007 --> 02:32:43.448]  Marshals Service to serve my case or serve my summons complaint against Nancy Pelosi and 385 others.
[02:32:43.508 --> 02:32:47.049]  So after about 85 were served, the federal court the next day called it back.
[02:32:47.469 --> 02:32:57.662]   They canceled the filing and on the docket it'll show that they classified it as a a mistake and my complaint was deficient. So they can't do
[02:32:57.662 --> 02:33:01.451]   that. So we took them to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. We didn't win there. So we
[02:33:01.451 --> 02:33:03.181]  took both courts to state court.
[02:33:03.181 --> 02:33:08.462]   And finally, after that battling, they reinstated my case and they ordered the clerk of the court to
[02:33:08.462 --> 02:33:13.742]   actually issue the summonses. So that's still alive. That case is still alive, identical to
[02:33:13.742 --> 02:33:18.062]   the one that's in front of the Supreme Court right now. So that one with my brother's name on it,
[02:33:18.062 --> 02:33:22.062]   Walland, started in state court, went to federal court, and then went to 10th Circuit Court of
[02:33:22.062 --> 02:33:26.782]   Appeals. They delayed. They wouldn't make a decision. So after four months, we decided we
[02:33:26.782 --> 02:33:31.341]   needed to do something. We found Rule 11 of the Supreme Court and we...
[02:33:31.513 --> 02:33:35.864]  Delivered it to them and in five days we received a call from the clerk of the court's office.
[02:33:36.225 --> 02:33:39.553]  Now the clerk of the court for the US Supreme Court is not a justice clerk.
[02:33:39.997 --> 02:33:45.540]  This person is Scott Sessions Harris and for 11 years he was the attorney for the Supreme Court.
[02:33:46.001 --> 02:33:58.088]  So his office, a case analyst from his office, calls us and tells us that they've decided to accept our petition without a decision from the Tenth Circuit and that we can move forward with a Rule 11 petition for the U.S.
[02:33:58.108 --> 02:33:58.688]  Supreme Court.
[02:33:59.148 --> 02:34:03.231]  And then they asked us to insert some special documents in it that were not required.
[02:34:03.251 --> 02:34:05.292]  They had gone into the docket and saw the whole case.
[02:34:05.652 --> 02:34:09.433]  And they asked us to actually include some extra documents.
[02:34:09.453 --> 02:34:09.934]  So we did.
[02:34:09.974 --> 02:34:10.854]  We got all that ready.
[02:34:10.874 --> 02:34:12.474]  I guess we were ready to get that off to them.
[02:34:12.855 --> 02:34:15.115]  Someone must have let the 10th Circuit Court know.
[02:34:15.135 --> 02:34:18.657]  There are three judges there to make a decision because they hurried and made a decision.
[02:34:18.717 --> 02:34:23.919]  I guess they didn't want to go down in history as blocking or sitting on a national emergency case, right?
[02:34:23.939 --> 02:34:24.919]  So they had to do something.
[02:34:25.499 --> 02:34:26.160]  And so here we are.
[02:34:26.180 --> 02:34:29.924]  So we call the court and go, Hey, we're going to get this to you, but they've made a decision.
[02:34:30.024 --> 02:34:32.486]  So should we change the rule 11 part of it?
[02:34:32.906 --> 02:34:35.469]  And it's still, they said, yes, go ahead and take that out.
[02:34:35.509 --> 02:34:36.490]  You don't need that anymore.
[02:34:36.510 --> 02:34:40.394]  It'll just get it to us and make sure you put in what we've asked you to put in.
[02:34:40.774 --> 02:34:42.035]  And how soon can you get it to us?
[02:34:42.516 --> 02:34:46.800]  And we said, well, Roland, who was taking the call said, well, it's going to take about two weeks.
[02:34:47.220 --> 02:34:50.203]   And the, uh, If the analyst says, we need it sooner than that.
[02:34:50.243 --> 02:34:52.084]  Can you get it to us sooner than two weeks?
[02:34:52.564 --> 02:34:53.865]  And he says, well, we'll do what we can.
[02:34:53.885 --> 02:34:55.566]  And so he was kind of shocked.
[02:34:55.607 --> 02:34:59.089]  We were all shocked that they were really kind of putting us, putting some pressure on to get it.
[02:34:59.169 --> 02:35:01.871]  And they also says, make sure you put in what we asked you to put in.
[02:35:02.311 --> 02:35:04.513]  So instead of two weeks, we got it to him in one week.
[02:35:05.783 --> 02:35:06.204]  A week.
[02:35:06.404 --> 02:35:11.048]  Okay, so this case, we're going to come right back with Loy Brunson, and this is the case to keep your eyes on, folks.
[02:35:11.348 --> 02:35:17.413]  The date that they gave is approaching, and the date just made my jaw drop, the one that they gave him for the conference.
[02:35:17.433 --> 02:35:18.654]  You're going to want to stay on for this.
[02:35:18.674 --> 02:35:25.961]  There's a couple of details and a couple of little things in this case, big things in this case, you're going to want to pay attention to right back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:26.121 --> 02:35:27.501]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:27.541 --> 02:35:28.981]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host.
[02:35:29.142 --> 02:35:30.282]  So glad to be with you today.
[02:35:30.342 --> 02:35:31.662]  This case is so important.
[02:35:31.782 --> 02:35:38.943]  My guest, Loy Brunson, is with me to talk about this case that is not getting, of course, the mainstream media attention at all.
[02:35:39.343 --> 02:35:41.044]  They don't even want you to know about this case.
[02:35:41.444 --> 02:35:45.244]  In fact, this case is not about the outcome of the election.
[02:35:45.364 --> 02:35:55.266]  This case is about the fact that 388 members of our Senate, our Congress, this includes the administration, are being sued for violating their oath of office.
[02:35:55.746 --> 02:35:56.426]  That is correct.
[02:35:56.466 --> 02:35:58.527]  They created a huge national security breach by doing that.
[02:35:58.346 --> 02:36:04.146]   investigation, a simple investigation, with a hundred witnesses. A hundred witnesses brought
[02:36:04.146 --> 02:36:09.206]   forth and they said that was not compelling enough to have an investigation. And so it's
[02:36:09.206 --> 02:36:12.945]  a violation of their oath. Correct, Loy?
[02:36:12.945 --> 02:36:17.947]   That is correct. They created a huge national security breach by doing that. They're supposed
[02:36:17.947 --> 02:36:22.586]   to defend us and the Constitution from enemies, domestic and foreign. And when you have crimes
[02:36:22.586 --> 02:36:27.226]   and evidence of stuff going on that's bad, you investigate it.
[02:36:27.177 --> 02:36:31.938]  It's sort of like you're on a ship and your watchman sees the tip of an iceberg and says, oh, it's just a little one.
[02:36:32.659 --> 02:36:34.279]  And said, this is much bigger than that.
[02:36:34.859 --> 02:36:37.260]  So you want me to continue with the story where we left off?
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:39.200]  It was the court.
[02:36:39.440 --> 02:36:41.941]  It was supposed to take two weeks and it took how long?
[02:36:43.041 --> 02:36:43.581]  Just a week.
[02:36:43.621 --> 02:36:46.362]  So we were able to overnight mail it to them on a Thursday.
[02:36:46.382 --> 02:36:49.903]  They got it Friday and they docketed it on Monday.
[02:36:50.393 --> 02:36:54.098]  And they showed, filed on the docket that it was filed the day we sent it.
[02:36:54.538 --> 02:36:57.081]  And then, uh, they also notified the U.S.
[02:36:57.121 --> 02:37:01.607]  attorneys that they had until November 23rd, which is about 30 days to respond.
[02:37:01.627 --> 02:37:01.947]  The U.S.
[02:37:02.006 --> 02:37:05.287]   attorneys at this point have one opportunity to fight this before it goes
[02:37:05.287 --> 02:37:09.006]   into conference where the nine justices get together and vote to have it move
[02:37:09.006 --> 02:37:13.925]   forward or not. And so they, it comes November 23rd rolls around and they
[02:37:13.925 --> 02:37:17.365]   haven't done anything at all. They hadn't filed a waiver and that's another
[02:37:17.365 --> 02:37:21.127]   document that my brother received in the mail from the from the Supreme Court
[02:37:21.127 --> 02:37:26.525]   asking him to send a waiver, waiving their right to file an opposition so
[02:37:26.525 --> 02:37:29.486]   that they could move forward with this more quickly. But the US attorneys did
[02:37:29.486 --> 02:37:31.566]  not sign a waiver.
[02:37:31.578 --> 02:37:32.459]  They didn't do anything.
[02:37:32.519 --> 02:37:34.560]  So the 23rd rules around nothing's happened.
[02:37:34.600 --> 02:37:38.303]  But at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, we see the docket shows that the U.S.
[02:37:38.343 --> 02:37:41.105]  attorneys are no longer representing the 380 defendants.
[02:37:41.585 --> 02:37:45.768]  Instead, the United States Solicitor General is now on board representing the defendants.
[02:37:46.108 --> 02:37:49.210]  And she does not ask for an extension to file the waiver.
[02:37:49.370 --> 02:37:50.231]  And she does not.
[02:37:51.686 --> 02:37:56.269]  She doesn't file the waiver, but instead, no, actually she files the waiver.
[02:37:56.789 --> 02:37:58.390]  She doesn't file an opposition.
[02:37:58.450 --> 02:38:00.711]  She files the waiver and that's what really stunned us.
[02:38:01.071 --> 02:38:04.873]  And then after that they set a conference date of January 6th.
[02:38:04.893 --> 02:38:11.776]  So just a few days later after they had signed and filed the waiver, January 6th pops up on the calendar as the date for the conference.
[02:38:12.137 --> 02:38:14.618]  So that was pretty stunning and exciting to see that.
[02:38:15.748 --> 02:38:17.710]  That was jaw-dropping, I'm sure.
[02:38:17.850 --> 02:38:19.291]  January 6th.
[02:38:19.311 --> 02:38:22.654]  And let me remind everybody again, you don't just get a case this far.
[02:38:22.734 --> 02:38:24.716]  This is almost impossible to do this.
[02:38:25.136 --> 02:38:29.079]  And the fact that they were instructing and helping, it gives me a little hope, right?
[02:38:29.179 --> 02:38:34.103]  Because they didn't have to do that, but they wanted to make sure to get this case in front of them.
[02:38:34.123 --> 02:38:37.987]  That's why I said it could go very, very good, or for cynical me, it could go very, very bad.
[02:38:39.684 --> 02:38:42.528]  I don't know how it could go bad at this point.
[02:38:42.568 --> 02:38:46.313]  You've got, well I do, but I mean I don't know that that would come to fruition.
[02:38:46.653 --> 02:38:49.757]  You've got these people that want to do the hearing.
[02:38:49.777 --> 02:38:56.847]  So this conference that comes first on January 6th is the precursor to whether or not they're going to hear the case both sides.
[02:38:57.427 --> 02:38:57.707]  Correct.
[02:38:58.168 --> 02:38:59.169]  Exactly, that's right.
[02:38:59.589 --> 02:39:02.491]  The conference by themselves, the justices go in and vote.
[02:39:02.551 --> 02:39:06.794]  Nine of them vote, if four of them vote for it to move forward, then it moves forward.
[02:39:07.075 --> 02:39:11.678]  And I just want to emphasize again that they allowed us to file without getting the Tenth Circuit Court decision.
[02:39:12.059 --> 02:39:18.984]  They could have easily just tossed it back and said, you can't come to the Supreme Court until you get the final decision from the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, right?
[02:39:19.284 --> 02:39:22.847]  But they let us bypass that, and then after we did, then the Tenth Circuit made a decision.
[02:39:23.243 --> 02:39:27.808]  So they've already characterized this as a national emergency, and then they put pressure on us to get it sooner.
[02:39:28.790 --> 02:39:38.341]  And so we have a lot of... And then January 6th being the date for conference is just like, this has got to be a sign to people that they're doing the right thing.
[02:39:39.463 --> 02:39:40.364]  It's jaw-dropping.
[02:39:40.444 --> 02:39:41.524]  January 6th.
[02:39:42.145 --> 02:39:45.627]  And it gives me a little glimmer of hope, actually, for cynical me.
[02:39:45.747 --> 02:39:47.068]  So I'm loving this.
[02:39:47.188 --> 02:39:48.408]  And this is the other thing, too.
[02:39:48.629 --> 02:39:52.911]  If people wonder why this is so rare, it's because we have what's called, I think, Title 28, right?
[02:39:53.251 --> 02:39:58.915]  Where it protects all of these people from all the crimes that they're doing currently and have been for many, many decades.
[02:39:59.515 --> 02:40:12.827]  It actually provides this protection but this case would actually take away that protection so that in the future if you ever wanted to sue to take those these people to court for violating their oath you could absolutely do that.
[02:40:12.867 --> 02:40:18.632]  This is a total game changer if this is able to go forward and actually have a victorious outcome here.
[02:40:19.293 --> 02:40:19.613]  Correct?
[02:40:19.633 --> 02:40:28.264]   Yeah exactly and why would they even let it come into the court because it's like once they let it in It's going to be a huge decision either way.
[02:40:28.344 --> 02:40:32.466]  So they put themselves at risk with either side by taking it on.
[02:40:32.606 --> 02:40:33.767]  And so we're pretty confident.
[02:40:33.787 --> 02:40:34.828]  We believe it's going to be a 9-0.
[02:40:34.848 --> 02:40:36.269]  The U.S.
[02:40:36.289 --> 02:40:40.912]  Solicitor General has a reputation for doing whatever she wants without consulting with anyone.
[02:40:41.252 --> 02:40:43.834]  She's a pretty independent United States Solicitor General.
[02:40:44.214 --> 02:40:53.600]  So we believe it's very possible that she read through the documents and saw that it was just about the oath of office, that it wasn't about any kind of interpretation of the Constitution or any kind of political agenda.
[02:40:54.100 --> 02:40:55.561]  And she can see this is a no-brainer.
[02:40:55.801 --> 02:40:57.101]  Of course we want investigations.
[02:40:57.141 --> 02:41:00.663]  Of course we want to make sure that the oath of office is real and enforceable.
[02:41:00.983 --> 02:41:03.044]  Article 6 of the Constitution is very clear.
[02:41:03.064 --> 02:41:07.686]  It states that they shall be bound by oath to this Constitution.
[02:41:07.926 --> 02:41:15.089]  Well, they can't be bound by what you said when they have immunity, but that immunity, those immunity statutes, are unconstitutional.
[02:41:15.109 --> 02:41:23.374]   In California, they have a statute, a state statute, that excludes from perjury charges Politicians taking the oath of office.
[02:41:23.675 --> 02:41:28.478]  It's like talking about a flagrant, in-your-face violation of the Constitution.
[02:41:28.518 --> 02:41:30.380]  So this is a major constitutional issue.
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:32.641]  Easy decision, I think, for the justices.
[02:41:32.701 --> 02:41:34.463]  And they can say it had nothing to do with politics.
[02:41:34.803 --> 02:41:36.464]  Look, there are both sides of the aisle of this.
[02:41:36.704 --> 02:41:37.185]  Defendants.
[02:41:37.205 --> 02:41:38.406]  There are Republican defendants.
[02:41:38.426 --> 02:41:39.506]  There are Democrat defendants.
[02:41:39.807 --> 02:41:41.208]  There's even a socialist defendant.
[02:41:41.668 --> 02:41:43.409]  So it's nothing about politics.
[02:41:43.429 --> 02:41:46.051]  Nothing about special interpretations of the Constitution.
[02:41:46.071 --> 02:41:46.752]  It's a no-brainer.
[02:41:48.095 --> 02:41:48.856]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:41:48.896 --> 02:41:50.476]  In fact, this is all the Democrats.
[02:41:50.857 --> 02:41:55.139]  And then, of course, your choice-select rhinos, which we all know who those people are.
[02:41:55.459 --> 02:41:57.040]  They're a disgrace to the country.
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:41:58.261]  I think very traitorous.
[02:41:58.761 --> 02:42:00.522]  And I know they hate that word, right?
[02:42:00.562 --> 02:42:01.943]  Can't just toss that word around.
[02:42:02.023 --> 02:42:03.504]  But that's exactly what's happened.
[02:42:03.784 --> 02:42:07.806]  And when they all said no to an investigation, what were they so afraid of?
[02:42:07.886 --> 02:42:08.847]  And why did they do it?
[02:42:08.887 --> 02:42:10.588]  Well, we all know the answer to that.
[02:42:10.968 --> 02:42:16.871]  And so what's wonderful about this is, number one, you were able to bypass the lower court on this.
[02:42:16.932 --> 02:42:20.474]  That's usually where everybody gets shut down is the lower court, and they know it.
[02:42:20.794 --> 02:42:23.415]  But for some reason, they wanted this case.
[02:42:23.855 --> 02:42:26.157]  They wanted this case in the public domain.
[02:42:26.177 --> 02:42:29.159]  They wanted to make sure people understood this case, heard this case.
[02:42:29.479 --> 02:42:35.042]  And then, of course, with these protections being annihilated, people would think twice about running for office.
[02:42:35.402 --> 02:42:44.034]  If they knew that they could get sued, right now you can conduct, I guess, every crime in the book and get away with it if you're a senator or a congressman, which most of them are doing.
[02:42:44.475 --> 02:42:47.599]  And so, you know, being bought and sold in the way that they are.
[02:42:48.019 --> 02:42:51.945]  And so what's amazing is, is maybe, just maybe, it won't save us.
[02:42:52.305 --> 02:42:58.168]  But it would do something where it would open up a gateway because this all this would be 388 people out.
[02:42:58.728 --> 02:43:01.029]  It would completely transform everything, right?
[02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:07.232]  And if they had to get out, right, if we were able to push them out and they could never run for office again.
[02:43:07.572 --> 02:43:13.976]  You will have another select group of rhinos and lefties and all of these people, but this does give us a chance.
[02:43:14.136 --> 02:43:16.757]  It gives us a chance, and I think this is kind of a God thing.
[02:43:17.198 --> 02:43:27.384]  It gives us a chance to maybe, possibly, become educated enough and change enough in who we would cast a vote for in the future and then hold their feet to the fire.
[02:43:27.504 --> 02:43:29.325]  I know that's asking a lot for cynical me.
[02:43:29.705 --> 02:43:34.446]  But let me just say there's a hope there that we would save ourselves because no one's going to save us.
[02:43:34.486 --> 02:43:42.627]  This case isn't going to save us, but it could certainly open a door to absolutely reinvent the Senate and the Congress and of course the presidency, right?
[02:43:44.028 --> 02:43:44.828]  Well, absolutely.
[02:43:44.968 --> 02:43:46.568]  And this would be a filtering process.
[02:43:46.808 --> 02:43:53.649]  You wouldn't have the same kinds of candidates running for office when they know that you can be accountable to the oath and the Constitution.
[02:43:53.669 --> 02:43:59.722]   So I think we wouldn't see the rhinos and we wouldn't see the The unconstitutional candidates that we've seen in the past.
[02:44:00.122 --> 02:44:05.965]  There are a lot of heroes that have given their lives and are willing to give their lives for the Constitution and liberty and freedom.
[02:44:06.385 --> 02:44:10.548]  And those are the kind of candidates that have been pushed out of the political system because of corruption.
[02:44:10.888 --> 02:44:13.309]  And those are the ones that would replace the others.
[02:44:13.349 --> 02:44:21.834]  So I think we would see a much more constitutional group of candidates coming and taking those places, filling those vacancies.
[02:44:22.975 --> 02:44:23.555]  Absolutely.
[02:44:23.595 --> 02:44:26.596]  I'm just loving this case, and it's really something to keep our eyes on.
[02:44:26.956 --> 02:44:33.877]  The other thing is, what is the Senate, or what is the SCOTUS, the Supreme Court, what could they be challenged by right now?
[02:44:33.917 --> 02:44:37.878]  There's probably a few things that they might be a little nervous about.
[02:44:37.898 --> 02:44:43.399]  I know that all of these hardcore leftists would like to provide us with term limits in SCOTUS.
[02:44:43.439 --> 02:44:46.139]  They would like to do these things, which would mean Clarence Thomas was out.
[02:44:46.499 --> 02:44:50.340]  There's a, you know, pack the court, all these ideas that they've tried to float.
[02:44:50.861 --> 02:44:52.225]  Now, do any of them have legs?
[02:44:52.587 --> 02:45:08.854]   Not quite sure, but I know that there might be some within the SCOTUS that think There needs to be a stop to the well-laid plans of some of these hardcore leftists if they were able to do some of the things like removing the Electoral College, the things that make us very American.
[02:45:08.894 --> 02:45:11.136]  I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show with Lloyd Brunson.
[02:45:11.156 --> 02:45:12.818]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:45:12.898 --> 02:45:14.739]  My guest Lloyd Brunson is with me.
[02:45:15.220 --> 02:45:18.543]  And a couple of things I just want to say.
[02:45:18.603 --> 02:45:27.307]   We've got Christmas coming and Christmas gave hope It delivered hope to mankind for the entire world and all those that were to follow.
[02:45:27.607 --> 02:45:29.989]  And what a wonderful time of year this is.
[02:45:30.489 --> 02:45:32.091]  And I wanted to showcase today's show.
[02:45:32.191 --> 02:45:39.716]  Usually I would do a Christmas message or something like that, but this is the one thing I have my eye on as far as being very intriguing and something to watch.
[02:45:40.317 --> 02:45:42.318]  And, you know, we talk about all these things.
[02:45:42.338 --> 02:45:44.660]  When I started out the show, I was talking about different things.
[02:45:45.140 --> 02:45:47.322]  Number one, we've got a silent holocaust going on.
[02:45:48.463 --> 02:45:53.387]  Between abortion and between what these shots are doing, what the entire vaccine program is doing to us.
[02:45:54.068 --> 02:45:57.450]  The second thing is, I talked about Elon Musk, I talked about timing, remember?
[02:45:57.911 --> 02:46:01.994]  And timing is interesting because everything has an aspect of timing to it.
[02:46:02.375 --> 02:46:03.816]  Why didn't Elon do that a year ago?
[02:46:03.896 --> 02:46:07.439]  You know, it's timing and usually that timing is distractions.
[02:46:08.380 --> 02:46:10.121]  And we talk about that a lot.
[02:46:10.822 --> 02:46:28.110]   Yet, there are sometimes good timings with things that I think God And that's why today's message instead, you know, Christmas, I do a lot on Christmas and I love Christmas in this time of year, but we also need a little bit of hope as well.
[02:46:28.170 --> 02:46:29.271]  And that's what this case is.
[02:46:29.632 --> 02:46:33.417]  My guest, Loy Brunson, has filed this lawsuit.
[02:46:33.997 --> 02:46:41.002]  388 members of the Senate, the Congress, and the fraudulent administration and it would actually throw them out for violating their oath.
[02:46:41.142 --> 02:46:43.344]  They've never been sued for violating their oath.
[02:46:43.404 --> 02:46:44.024]  Why is that?
[02:46:44.184 --> 02:46:44.485]  You know?
[02:46:44.885 --> 02:46:58.054]  And so this case would actually do so because they said no to an investigation when they had a hundred witnesses for election fraud and they turned their back on it and they said no for whatever reason, whoever was telling them to say no, whatever the case may be.
[02:46:58.194 --> 02:46:58.735]  You know what I mean?
[02:46:59.495 --> 02:47:03.038]  And here we are with this case docketed for January 6th.
[02:47:04.125 --> 02:47:05.285]  By the Supreme Court.
[02:47:05.585 --> 02:47:17.449]  The Supreme Court helped him to not have to go through the lower courts, actually did this on Rule 11, which would be the national emergency, which is really interesting, very intriguing way to do that.
[02:47:17.929 --> 02:47:22.870]  And now as we come upon this conference, it'll be really interesting to see it move forward.
[02:47:22.910 --> 02:47:29.172]  I have a feeling it will if they work this hard to get you to get you in this place at this time, because you guys, this is just unreal.
[02:47:29.432 --> 02:47:30.372]  This just never happens.
[02:47:31.728 --> 02:47:34.068]  Lloyd, I'm sure there's been a lot of miracles along the way.
[02:47:35.069 --> 02:47:36.029]  Yes, there have.
[02:47:36.149 --> 02:47:40.030]  There are three brothers, we're in this together, and Darren is the legal mind behind it all.
[02:47:40.670 --> 02:47:43.690]  And, you know, I think the January 6th date is a Christmas gift.
[02:47:44.550 --> 02:47:49.331]  And when we say toss them out of office, it really could be quite smooth.
[02:47:49.471 --> 02:47:53.752]  The way I believe it would happen is a court would, the U.S.
[02:47:54.252 --> 02:48:04.860]   Marshal Service would be the ones to deliver an order from the federal court to the sergeant-at-arms, With a list of credentials to be canceled so they could cancel the credentials right there.
[02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:14.144]  There could be special government teams broadcast teams that go into the media to make sure that they're not, you know, inciting of riots and false information producing a lot of violence.
[02:48:14.684 --> 02:48:24.729]  And so they could we probably all of a sudden would see new faces on television where they're reporting the news explaining what's happening that it's a smooth transition that we're not losing our Republic.
[02:48:25.382 --> 02:48:27.983]  And nothing's happening wrong, but it's a good transition.
[02:48:28.263 --> 02:48:33.064]  And then the three directors of the Federal Communication Commission have taken oath to the constitution too.
[02:48:33.484 --> 02:48:45.606]  So they've had an obligation that they've neglected and violated their oath by allowing anything through the broadcast waves to generate any kind of negative feelings or criticism of our great constitution.
[02:48:45.646 --> 02:48:47.367]  They have an obligation to support and defend it.
[02:48:47.947 --> 02:48:48.287]  And so.
[02:48:49.094 --> 02:48:50.975]  I think there could actually be a pretty smooth transition.
[02:48:51.015 --> 02:48:58.417]  I have friends that are Democrats and Republicans, and I've asked them, what is it that you really want from your representatives?
[02:48:58.597 --> 02:48:59.657]  And they all say the same thing.
[02:49:00.038 --> 02:49:00.538]  Honesty.
[02:49:00.918 --> 02:49:02.198]  Well, that's what this case is about.
[02:49:02.258 --> 02:49:05.959]  It's simply about making our representatives honest, whether you're a Democrat or Republican.
[02:49:06.520 --> 02:49:12.482]  And so this would enforce the oath, and it would cause our representatives to be honest.
[02:49:12.622 --> 02:49:13.742]  That's basically what it is.
[02:49:14.955 --> 02:49:15.435]  I love this.
[02:49:15.475 --> 02:49:18.878]  You can go to 7discoveries.com and you can help them do this.
[02:49:18.938 --> 02:49:22.741]  It's become a full-time job now because they don't have millions of dollars for attorneys.
[02:49:22.941 --> 02:49:23.702]  They just don't have it.
[02:49:24.282 --> 02:49:27.204]  And so they're asking for your help because they've gotten this far.
[02:49:27.725 --> 02:49:30.327]  And certainly this would turn the country on a dime.
[02:49:30.387 --> 02:49:37.312]  I mean, can you imagine 388 moved out of office immediately for violating their oaths and then what that would do to the future?
[02:49:37.332 --> 02:49:41.475]  But let's just hope we can get educated enough to know what to look for in these representatives.
[02:49:41.535 --> 02:49:46.038]   Instead of voting for somebody because you want to go to dinner with them, Which is pretty much our criteria right now.
[02:49:46.058 --> 02:49:47.558]  Would I like to go to dinner with this guy?
[02:49:47.899 --> 02:49:49.179]  That's our whole criteria.
[02:49:49.499 --> 02:49:56.182]  Maybe we could get back to actually, you know, fielding out what they actually stand for and do they have a backbone and some courage, right?
[02:49:56.482 --> 02:49:59.864]  To do what's right in office and actually represent the Constitution.
[02:50:00.284 --> 02:50:06.106]  But I like this case because you've gotten this far and many, many things have happened in your favor to do so.
[02:50:06.467 --> 02:50:08.047]  And this case could change everything.
[02:50:08.067 --> 02:50:11.589]  It wouldn't save us, but it could certainly open up a window of opportunity.
[02:50:12.029 --> 02:50:19.958]  And I think that God, in His good graces, would certainly open up an opportunity if that was how this was supposed to go down.
[02:50:19.998 --> 02:50:21.820]  I could see something like this happening.
[02:50:22.141 --> 02:50:26.165]  People could think this was very chaotic, but like you said, it actually could be pretty smooth.
[02:50:26.546 --> 02:50:28.448]  Smoother than what people would think it would be.
[02:50:28.788 --> 02:50:32.493]  Some people would ask at this point, would that mean Trump would be in office?
[02:50:33.273 --> 02:50:41.595]  Because of the election results and what we absolutely know happened with the electoral college count, but did not get revealed.
[02:50:42.015 --> 02:50:43.236]  And so, would that happen?
[02:50:44.136 --> 02:50:44.456]  Who knows?
[02:50:45.076 --> 02:50:45.656]  It's possible.
[02:50:45.696 --> 02:50:49.257]  We've had discussion with constitutional attorneys and stuff about this.
[02:50:49.277 --> 02:50:51.518]  It's really up to the Supreme Court.
[02:50:51.538 --> 02:50:53.839]  This could be considered an act of war.
[02:50:54.799 --> 02:51:03.506]   When you have that much evidence of infiltration to our sacred election process and then people won't investigate it.
[02:51:03.506 --> 02:51:07.746]   And so this actually gives the Supreme Court complete discretion and power to do whatever
[02:51:07.746 --> 02:51:12.206]   they think is deemed necessary to secure our security in this country.
[02:51:12.206 --> 02:51:16.466]   And so they could completely adjudicate this whole case before the 6th, the whole complaint,
[02:51:16.466 --> 02:51:21.246]   they could actually execute it and completely take care of it before January 6th.
[02:51:21.246 --> 02:51:23.346]  And I'd like to just focus again on January 6th.
[02:51:23.346 --> 02:51:25.047]  Why would they set the date January 6th?
[02:51:25.047 --> 02:51:27.346]  That's kind of an in-your-face date.
[02:51:27.346 --> 02:51:31.146]   It's a two-year anniversary of what we're doing, and I think it's a confidence.
[02:51:31.068 --> 02:51:35.154]  They can't really go public with this, but they can let us know that they've got it.
[02:51:35.695 --> 02:51:37.418]  And the fact that they knew we would.
[02:51:37.478 --> 02:51:45.289]  I'm sure they didn't ask us to sign a nondisclosure agreement when they were working with us and telling us that they accepted this as a national emergency type case.
[02:51:45.649 --> 02:52:04.164]  So I think we have every reason in the world to be hopeful and positive and even if the worst case scenario happened, we can do a motion for reconsideration and I think we've received about 15,000 letters so far, copies of what they've sent to the Supreme Court, friends of the court, so people can write a letter to the court encouraging them to do the right thing.
[02:52:04.184 --> 02:52:04.945]  It's totally legal.
[02:52:05.484 --> 02:52:06.245]  And that's growing.
[02:52:06.345 --> 02:52:11.949]  And as it grows, if it's not allowed to move forward, we can do a motion for reconsideration.
[02:52:12.249 --> 02:52:15.452]  And then we have much more public support to push it over.
[02:52:15.492 --> 02:52:16.753]  And then we still have another case.
[02:52:16.813 --> 02:52:19.955]  It's just right there coming up behind this one.
[02:52:19.995 --> 02:52:21.476]  But I think now is the time to act.
[02:52:21.516 --> 02:52:24.558]  We've got to act in the most effective way.
[02:52:24.598 --> 02:52:28.141]  And right now, there's too much damage being done for this not to happen immediately.
[02:52:28.161 --> 02:52:29.562]  So I think the justices are smart.
[02:52:29.602 --> 02:52:30.403]  I think they'll get it done.
[02:52:31.556 --> 02:52:34.057]  You can go to 7discoveries.com and you can help them.
[02:52:34.438 --> 02:52:36.559]  You can get a copy of the entire case.
[02:52:36.639 --> 02:52:41.201]  You can look at everything that they told them and SCOTUS.
[02:52:41.301 --> 02:52:43.302]  And it would be nice to see SCOTUS do the right thing.
[02:52:43.322 --> 02:52:44.643]  They've made some pretty bad moves.
[02:52:45.363 --> 02:52:47.404]  It would be nice to see that.
[02:52:47.585 --> 02:52:50.046]  It would restore maybe a little faith in the process.
[02:52:50.546 --> 02:52:55.949]  I mean, don't think for a second I don't understand that there's so much theater going on at every turn.
[02:52:56.289 --> 02:52:57.630]  Trust me, I get it.
[02:52:58.340 --> 02:53:01.561]  Yet at the same time, there are some things that we can still do.
[02:53:01.621 --> 02:53:04.863]  The Constitution's still in play, and they're very much afraid of that.
[02:53:04.963 --> 02:53:06.363]  They're afraid of the Constitution.
[02:53:06.744 --> 02:53:09.745]  So that tells you that the Constitution still has its power.
[02:53:09.885 --> 02:53:11.265]  Otherwise, we'd be cooked right now.
[02:53:11.766 --> 02:53:13.926]  So this is something we can work with.
[02:53:13.966 --> 02:53:15.767]  We don't need to fight another revolution.
[02:53:15.807 --> 02:53:17.288]  It's already been fought and won.
[02:53:17.648 --> 02:53:23.770]  What we do need to do is like what Loy Brunson and his brothers are doing, sounding the trumpet, if you will.
[02:53:24.331 --> 02:53:25.671]  They are, hey, they're trumpeters.
[02:53:25.711 --> 02:53:26.232]  What can I say?
[02:53:26.291 --> 02:53:27.572]  I love this about them.
[02:53:27.572 --> 02:53:33.691]   And also to be able to do something within the system that could actually maybe go the distance
[02:53:33.691 --> 02:53:37.570]  and maybe change things and maybe set new precedents.
[02:53:37.570 --> 02:53:38.730]  And that's what this would do.
[02:53:38.730 --> 02:53:41.412]  It would remove the protections.
[02:53:41.412 --> 02:53:46.451]   And when they violate their oath of office, as they always do, it seems,
[02:53:46.451 --> 02:53:51.650]   they would maybe be a little more afraid in the future to violate it and to do the things that they're doing
[02:53:51.650 --> 02:53:53.051]  to be so bought and sold.
[02:53:52.955 --> 02:53:54.715]  Sorry to say it, but it's so the truth.
[02:53:54.875 --> 02:54:02.777]  And everybody seems to be, even some of what we think are these patriots out there, blaming every single thing that they can for the election fraud.
[02:54:03.237 --> 02:54:09.679]  Blaming Sam and the Ukrainian money laundering, and then of course blaming Democrats and blaming money.
[02:54:10.519 --> 02:54:16.725]  This is fraud in our voting system and we need to take care of this because nothing's going to change, right?
[02:54:17.005 --> 02:54:29.196]  This was the most obvious fraud that ever took place and so the fact that it's the most obvious then presents this other reason that this case moving forward is such a wonderful little Christmas present.
[02:54:29.376 --> 02:54:30.016]  I love this.
[02:54:30.557 --> 02:54:32.659]  Anything else you'd like to add, Loy, in this last minute?
[02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:34.240]  Well, sure.
[02:54:34.260 --> 02:54:39.437]   Three of the justices have actually voted in favor of Thank you all for your letters.
[02:54:39.457 --> 02:54:40.298]  They're phenomenal letters.
[02:54:40.318 --> 02:54:43.139]  It's just amazing thoughts and prayers that are coming this direction.
[02:54:43.159 --> 02:54:44.340]  Thank you for that.
[02:54:44.539 --> 02:54:47.378]   like Roe vs. Wade, they really stuck their necks out on that.
[02:54:47.378 --> 02:54:51.179]   So I think that's an excellent indicator of what's gonna happen with this.
[02:54:51.179 --> 02:54:54.159]   And I just wanna thank everyone for listening and go to 7discoveries.com.
[02:54:54.159 --> 02:54:55.638]  Thank you all for your letters.
[02:54:55.638 --> 02:54:56.958]  They're phenomenal letters.
[02:54:56.958 --> 02:55:00.639]   It's just amazing thoughts and prayers that are coming this direction.
[02:55:00.639 --> 02:55:01.479]  Thank you for that.
[02:55:01.479 --> 02:55:03.679]  Thank you, Kate, for having me on the show.
[02:55:03.679 --> 02:55:06.738]   You bet, and InfoWars had already done just such a great piece on you,
[02:55:06.738 --> 02:55:09.398]   and I wanted to mention that because they did a great, great piece
[02:55:09.398 --> 02:55:11.398]  highlighting all of these efforts.
[02:55:11.398 --> 02:55:17.438]   And we just needed, you know, to know more about this, and understand the miracles of taking place.
[02:55:17.591 --> 02:55:22.033]  The Supreme Court reaching out to help to make sure that they get this in their preview.
[02:55:22.253 --> 02:55:22.453]  Wow!
[02:55:23.852 --> 02:55:31.376]  Again, this is maybe a little bit of a miracle, and I would have to say keep your eye on this one for sure.
[02:55:31.456 --> 02:55:38.680]  Loy Brunson, go to 7discoveries.com, help them out this Christmas, and this is coming up January 6th, so it's a big, big deal.
[02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:41.662]  And thank you for tuning in to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:55:41.722 --> 02:55:44.764]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from katedallyradio.com.
[02:55:44.583 --> 02:55:45.583]  Thanks, Loy.
[02:55:45.583 --> 02:55:51.583]  [Music]
[02:55:51.583 --> 02:55:57.583]   InfoWars is known for delivering information that is hard-hitting and incredibly accurate,
[02:55:57.583 --> 02:56:01.583]   and that has been game-changing, not just here in America, but across the world.
[02:56:01.371 --> 02:56:05.654]  Well, it's the same thing when it comes to the products we promote at InfoWars4.com.
[02:56:06.375 --> 02:56:22.708]   And now, in the last year, we developed a relationship With a major pharmaceutical company owner, who also just so happens to be one of the top supplement makers, not just in America, but worldwide, to give us deals that nobody else has gotten.
[02:56:23.289 --> 02:56:24.410]  So you see these three products?
[02:56:25.310 --> 02:56:31.435]  They're private labels of already number one best-selling products in the US and North American market.
[02:56:32.276 --> 02:56:33.598]  Already number one.
[02:56:33.778 --> 02:56:34.699]  All three of these products.
[02:56:34.980 --> 02:56:38.444]  They got a bunch of other products with a private label that are also all in the top ten or so.
[02:56:38.484 --> 02:56:44.451]  But these three are the top three products right now in these most important best-selling categories.
[02:56:45.052 --> 02:56:45.332]  Okay?
[02:56:46.173 --> 02:56:46.273]  And...

[02:57:03.432 --> 02:57:05.274]  1776 testosterone boost.

[02:57:19.186 --> 02:57:23.390]  Now this, you better really be careful with and consult your healthcare provider.
