[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.390]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.932]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[00:00:02.972 --> 00:00:04.033]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[00:00:04.093 --> 00:00:05.475]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:06.236]  And Joe Rogan?
[00:00:06.476 --> 00:00:06.956]  Elon Musk?
[00:00:07.116 --> 00:00:08.178]  You know where they tune in, right?
[00:00:08.458 --> 00:00:11.081]  They tune in right here!
[00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:13.824]  InfoWars.
[00:00:14.204 --> 00:00:15.085]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:15.185 --> 00:00:16.185]  today.
[00:00:16.185 --> 00:00:36.825]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:37.424 --> 00:00:43.424]  [Music]
[00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:59.805]  Back in 2008, while the masses flocked to Obama to save them from Dick Cheney, those waking up to the American nightmare could clearly see how he was a puppet to Wall Street and the big banks, and also to the military-industrial complex.
[00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:04.848]  Their profits soared as the anti-war movement disappeared.
[00:01:05.628 --> 00:01:10.431]  Obama even had an American citizen killed with a drone strike while eating dinner.
[00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:15.674]  Obama loved predator drones, and he normalized the unending war.
[00:01:16.154 --> 00:01:17.275]  I have two words for you.
[00:01:18.076 --> 00:01:18.976]  Predator drones.
[00:01:21.037 --> 00:01:23.037]  You will never see it coming.
[00:01:23.037 --> 00:01:25.037]  [laughter]
[00:01:25.037 --> 00:01:27.037]  [applause]
[00:01:27.037 --> 00:01:29.037]  You think I'm joking?
[00:01:29.037 --> 00:01:31.037]  [laughter]
[00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:34.168]  At first, Obama was not threatened by the election of Donald Trump.
[00:01:34.488 --> 00:01:36.830]  He had the all-powerful media on his side.
[00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.114]  President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!
[00:01:42.454 --> 00:01:43.375]  Exclamation point.
[00:01:44.416 --> 00:01:45.797]  At real Donald Trump.
[00:01:47.958 --> 00:01:49.119]  At real Donald Trump.
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.962]  At least I will go down as a president.
[00:01:55.024 --> 00:01:56.005]  But that didn't last.
[00:02:00.758 --> 00:02:12.407]  If we fall for- Trump got elected, and Obama helped lead a massive attack against him with the entire establishment, mainstream media, and loyal Democrats.
[00:02:12.927 --> 00:02:20.093]  And by the time the 2020 election was stolen right before our eyes, there was no doubt that Joe Biden was a puppet.
[00:02:20.913 --> 00:02:21.734]  But whose puppet?
[00:02:22.014 --> 00:02:34.078]  I think it's no surprise to know that it's not just Obama, but it's the whole Obama-Clinton machine that has been in power for a long time and continues to pull the strings behind the curtain in the Biden administration.
[00:02:34.138 --> 00:02:45.022]  But when we're talking about this ministry of truth, Will, what's even more disturbing than the fact that you have all these Democrats who are supporting it is that there are powerful Republicans who are supporting it as well.
[00:02:45.422 --> 00:02:53.765]  Obama and Clinton are puppets, along with at least 99% of all the Democrats and Republicans in Congress.
[00:02:54.405 --> 00:02:56.066]  And it's not even a government anymore.
[00:02:56.386 --> 00:03:02.929]  It's a criminal cabal made up of several crime families and corporations that see the people as a commodity.
[00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:20.741]  And now, while being exposed for some of the biggest crimes in American history, they are stealing every last penny from the American people, creating a worldwide famine, and provoking a war with a country that is showing off ways they can nuke we the people into oblivion.
[00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:31.236]  In Germany, hundreds of thousands of people are demanding that their government stop sending weapons to Ukraine, and urging them to move towards a peaceful resolution.
[00:03:32.037 --> 00:03:41.322]  While in America, it seems as if everyone is just going about their business, waiting for the next election, as if it's just a series on Netflix we are watching.
[00:03:41.923 --> 00:03:47.947]  But if we sit and do nothing, as we watch them start a nuclear war, are we innocent?
[00:03:49.195 --> 00:03:49.576]  The U.S.
[00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:58.026]  government is training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany and supplying Ukraine with hundreds of newly declassified suicide drones.
[00:03:59.127 --> 00:04:01.290]  The liars and thieves inhabiting the U.S.
[00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.035]  government are starting this war for their own puppet masters.
[00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:10.937]  But they are no one special, just old, old money with centuries of fraud.
[00:04:11.577 --> 00:04:14.938]  And we outnumber them 10,000 to one, conservatively.
[00:04:15.738 --> 00:04:16.838]  They're not going to stop.
[00:04:17.218 --> 00:04:20.479]  And now that they're being exposed, it's just going to get worse.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:28.382]  And so, wouldn't it be beautiful if we the people can stand up for what's right and stop World War III?
[00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:32.222]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:04:32.222 --> 00:04:43.822]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say, "I don't know what's
[00:04:43.822 --> 00:04:46.262]  going to happen at the end of this, but you ought to fight!"
[00:04:46.502 --> 00:04:48.684]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:04:50.605 --> 00:04:57.605]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:17.105 --> 00:05:22.605]  The right of a woman to kill her child is abortion.
[00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:33.329]  Biden says the quiet part out loud, but more and more people like Gloria Steinem of the Central Intelligence Agency on record wear shirts saying, I had an abortion and I'll do it again.
[00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:38.413]  And they talk about how they like it and how it made them feel good and how it empowers them to kill their child.
[00:05:39.454 --> 00:05:41.796]  This is not a minority of these leftist women.
[00:05:41.836 --> 00:05:43.337]  This is the majority of them.
[00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:51.296]  Have been basically endowed with the satanic spirit of when they aborted their baby because they were lied to that it wasn't a human.
[00:05:51.716 --> 00:05:57.440]  Instead of having the Holy Spirit soften their heart and repent of it and say, I'm not going to be part of this anymore.
[00:05:58.161 --> 00:06:00.803]  They said, no, I'm glad I did it.
[00:06:00.983 --> 00:06:07.128]  And you see the leftist ideology now becoming purely satanic because its roots were always satanic.
[00:06:07.148 --> 00:06:08.249]  I have repented.
[00:06:09.571 --> 00:06:24.582]  And the left is so blind and so tone deaf spiritually and culturally and intellectually and philosophically that every time I talk about the fact that I paid for abortions and I repented of it when I was about 19 years old.
[00:06:27.332 --> 00:06:31.474]  They say, look, here's the hypocrite, Jones, admitting he's been part of abortions but now he's against it.
[00:06:32.314 --> 00:06:42.579]  That's like saying if you murdered somebody or you robbed a bank when you were 25 years old and went to jail for 10 years and got out and became a Christian and a business owner, it was wrong, you robbed a bank and pistol-whipped the clerk.
[00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:45.300]  I haven't done that, it's hypothetical.
[00:06:47.161 --> 00:07:02.568]   And so, I was touched by the Holy Spirit when I was about 18, 19 and had nightmares about it and really was upset and I'm not going to sit there and just shell out $300 every time I get a chick pregnant.
[00:07:02.808 --> 00:07:09.290]  Because even if I wore a condom and stuff, back then I was so fertile I could look at a woman and get them pregnant.
[00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:12.652]  I mean, I still am.
[00:07:12.672 --> 00:07:13.972]  I'm 48 years old.
[00:07:13.992 --> 00:07:18.254]  But the point is, is that my dad confronted me when I was about 17.
[00:07:20.375 --> 00:07:22.736]  I was about to move out of the house and I needed money.
[00:07:23.756 --> 00:07:26.117]  He goes, oh, you need $300 again.
[00:07:26.657 --> 00:07:28.378]  Let me guess, you're killing another one of my grandchildren.
[00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.130]  He said, you need to stop it.
[00:07:34.071 --> 00:07:35.311]  Stop killing my grandchildren.
[00:07:36.351 --> 00:07:37.752]  He grabbed me by the arm really intensely.
[00:07:39.372 --> 00:07:46.334]  And that kind of set that off in my soul and my mind that what I'd done was wrong.
[00:07:46.594 --> 00:07:50.935]  And it was dehumanizing myself and the woman and my own child.
[00:07:50.995 --> 00:07:53.776]  And now I look at my four children that I would die for instantly.
[00:07:55.868 --> 00:08:01.392]  And it just makes me really realize how blind people are that have been part of this dehumanization.
[00:08:02.052 --> 00:08:05.875]  Because if you don't care about the unborn, well now they want to kill babies after they're born.
[00:08:05.895 --> 00:08:07.016]  They're passing laws to do it.
[00:08:08.537 --> 00:08:18.784]  They make all these sickening statements all over the news about how fun it is, and in the US and the UK they heat the hospitals with the dead bodies of the babies, turning them into a commodity.
[00:08:19.518 --> 00:08:24.078]   and they keep them alive sometimes for up to two weeks while they get all the orders in for their
[00:08:24.078 --> 00:08:28.877]   organs at the highest bidder and then they kill them. They've got all these policies and bioethics
[00:08:28.877 --> 00:08:35.998]   rules how they claim they do it and people that understood if a woman's raped or understood it's
[00:08:35.998 --> 00:08:40.557]   the first trimester that hey the woman's poor she can't raise another kid.
[00:08:40.818 --> 00:08:47.223]  You can see the argument for it, except then you realize the people behind it are satanic and it's really about total dehumanization.
[00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:50.025]  Because then they're like, you know what, we want to kill them for the day they're born.
[00:08:51.286 --> 00:08:54.229]  You're like, well, I can kind of see first couple months.
[00:08:54.289 --> 00:08:57.231]  I mean, it's a human, it's real, but it's not conscious yet.
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:15.088]  It's got a soul, spirit, it's still murder, but the licking of the lips and the getting off on the killing of the babies now to the day they're born, and now laws being passed for seven days, four weeks, and the litmus ideology is kill them up to age three.
[00:09:15.108 --> 00:09:17.570]  That's Peter Singer, one of the main founders of PETA.
[00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.751]  That's who these people are.
[00:09:21.485 --> 00:09:22.786]  And so let's go to a few of these clips.
[00:09:22.826 --> 00:09:30.629]  Here is Biden saying the quiet part out loud, and this is really hurting them bad, where he says, hold it, share it for yourself.
[00:09:31.549 --> 00:09:49.157]  The idea that we're going to make a judgment that is going to say that no one can make the judgment to choose to abort a child based on a decision by the Supreme Court, I think goes way overboard.
[00:09:51.974 --> 00:09:53.596]  So you heard it right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:54.817 --> 00:10:02.004]  The quote, the decision to abort a child, the decision to abort is actually murder.
[00:10:04.006 --> 00:10:09.751]  And unsurprisingly, he says the decision to abort is the decision to abort a child is the quote.
[00:10:11.073 --> 00:10:14.136]  Now here's some leftist on TikTok and Twitter.
[00:10:14.156 --> 00:10:14.956]  There's hours of this.
[00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:16.438]  There's a small sampling of it.
[00:10:18.174 --> 00:10:24.900]  Really talking about brutalizing babies and just crazy-eyed women getting off on the power of human sacrifice.
[00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.302]  The full group of videos is up on Infowars.com.
[00:10:28.342 --> 00:10:29.043]  Here's a small clip.
[00:10:29.663 --> 00:10:32.386]  Aborted babies being burned and then used for electricity?
[00:10:32.406 --> 00:10:33.847]  I hope they are.
[00:10:34.347 --> 00:10:36.289]  Jesus, I am so tired of seeing this.
[00:10:36.309 --> 00:10:36.709]  You know what?
[00:10:36.749 --> 00:10:37.550]  I hope so.
[00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:38.050]  I hope so.
[00:10:38.751 --> 00:10:39.752]  I sure hope so.
[00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:40.512]  I don't know.
[00:10:40.592 --> 00:10:41.273]  I hope so.
[00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:46.821]  Oh god, I hope so.
[00:10:47.201 --> 00:10:50.382]  I can just imagine the fucking snowflakes with that one!
[00:10:53.604 --> 00:10:53.964]  Oh no.
[00:10:54.604 --> 00:10:56.125]  I just eat mine straight from the can.
[00:10:56.145 --> 00:11:03.848]  I don't think we should be asking, are they being burned and used for electricity?
[00:11:03.948 --> 00:11:09.491]  I think we should be asking, why aren't they being burned and used for electricity?
[00:11:09.511 --> 00:11:10.371]  Three hours.
[00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:11.311]  Three hours.
[00:11:11.691 --> 00:11:12.592]  Recycle.
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.842]  Ooh, sustainable energy!
[00:11:17.862 --> 00:11:19.443]  I love the advocacy.
[00:11:19.784 --> 00:11:21.745]  We should try it, if we have it.
[00:11:21.845 --> 00:11:22.746]  Portable charger.
[00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:24.287]  Give me your feet!
[00:11:26.368 --> 00:11:30.211]  Now, of course, they're trying to bait people, manipulate them, but that's really the spirit of these women.
[00:11:30.271 --> 00:11:43.201]  We have the footage, of course, of the Texas Capitol, famously, with hundreds of pro-life men and women praying to try to restrict the murder of children, to curtail it, and a bunch of women in business suits showing up and saying, I love killing babies.
[00:11:43.541 --> 00:11:44.122]  Hail Satan.
[00:11:45.165 --> 00:11:47.046]  And that's really who these crazy-eyed people are.
[00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:52.731]  But the real thing that ties them all together is they look really ugly and really weak.
[00:11:53.411 --> 00:12:00.977]  The men and the women are really these pathetic jellyfish that get off on the power of killing children, even though no one wants to even have children with them.
[00:12:00.997 --> 00:12:02.038]  They're not having children.
[00:12:02.258 --> 00:12:04.420]  They want you to kill your children.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.882]  That's what these demon-possessed creatures are.
[00:12:07.662 --> 00:12:09.384]  Now, here's an example of what we're talking about.
[00:12:11.072 --> 00:12:16.936]  Here is a very powerful clip from a few years ago that's really softened a lot of hearts and woke a lot of people up.
[00:12:17.497 --> 00:12:19.278]  This is in 2019, Virginia.
[00:12:19.558 --> 00:12:25.402]  Delegate Kathy Tran, Democrat, introduces House Bill number 2491, that they've passed bills like this in other states.
[00:12:26.023 --> 00:12:32.447]  A bill that would eliminate restrictions on abortions in Virginia and would permit abortions to be performed right up until the moment of birth.
[00:12:32.687 --> 00:12:34.429]  Here is the admissions.
[00:12:35.182 --> 00:12:35.803]  Delegate Tran?
[00:12:36.044 --> 00:12:36.424]  Yes, sir.
[00:12:36.605 --> 00:12:49.720]   How late in a pregnancy would your bill apply if a physician was simply willing to certify that That the continuation of the pregnancy would impair the mental health of the woman.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.142]  How late are we talking about?
[00:12:52.983 --> 00:13:03.353]  So the way, the suggestion that we've made in the bill is to say it's in the third trimester and at the, you know, with the certification of the physician.
[00:13:03.993 --> 00:13:06.896]  So how late in the third trimester would you be able to do that?
[00:13:09.349 --> 00:13:15.371]  You know, it's very unfortunate that our physicians, our witnesses, were not able to attend today to speak specifically to that.
[00:13:15.391 --> 00:13:16.271]  No, I'm talking about your bill.
[00:13:17.532 --> 00:13:24.874]  How late in the third trimester could a physician perform an abortion if he indicated it would impair the mental health of the woman?
[00:13:26.095 --> 00:13:26.775]  Or physical health.
[00:13:27.395 --> 00:13:27.615]  Okay.
[00:13:27.855 --> 00:13:28.075]  Okay.
[00:13:28.236 --> 00:13:29.516]  I'm talking about the mental health.
[00:13:31.274 --> 00:13:32.275]  Through the third trimester.
[00:13:32.515 --> 00:13:34.416]  The third trimester goes all the way up to 40 weeks.
[00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.977]  Okay, but to the end of the third trimester?
[00:13:36.997 --> 00:13:38.738]  Yep, I don't think we have a limit in the bill.
[00:13:39.238 --> 00:13:58.788]  So, where it's obvious that a woman is about to give birth, she has physical signs that she is about to give a birth, would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified?
[00:14:02.264 --> 00:14:02.964]  She's dilating.
[00:14:06.186 --> 00:14:13.390]  Mr. Chairman, that would be a, you know, a decision that the doctor, the physician, and the woman would make at that point.
[00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:13.750]  I understand that.
[00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.031]  I'm asking if your bill allows that.
[00:14:15.751 --> 00:14:16.952]  My bill would allow that, yes.
[00:14:16.972 --> 00:14:23.676]  More than 10 states like California and New York have laws to kill babies up to after they're born.
[00:14:25.111 --> 00:14:28.073]  When you sign on to the Democrats in Hollywood, you sign on to Satanism.
[00:14:28.173 --> 00:14:33.976]  You sign on to killing babies, viable, healthy children, when there's even more people out there that want to adopt than there are abortions.
[00:14:34.517 --> 00:14:36.958]  These people want the power over human life, and not just babies.
[00:14:37.238 --> 00:14:38.839]  They want to kill the old people, they want to kill you.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.340]  That's what the vaccine's all about.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:40.741]  Stay with us.
[00:14:41.661 --> 00:15:06.291]   The very same leftists that say it's a woman's right in her body to kill an unborn child and the future of humanity, Are the same people that tell you, though, you don't control your body, when a multinational corporation run by eugenicists, who are on record saying they want to depopulate you through vaccines, want to force something in your body.
[00:15:08.653 --> 00:15:13.617]  And I believe that everything is between God and man, God and humans, God and woman.
[00:15:14.938 --> 00:15:21.925]   And you know if a woman wants to go to some killer, And have her baby killed.
[00:15:22.105 --> 00:15:22.965]  That's between you and God.
[00:15:24.586 --> 00:15:28.148]  And the Supreme Court's about to rule that under the Federalist system, it's up to the states.
[00:15:28.468 --> 00:15:29.069]  And I agree with that.
[00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:32.030]  But it's not enough for Democrats.
[00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:34.592]  They want to be able to go anywhere they want and have them anytime.
[00:15:34.612 --> 00:15:52.015]   And they're the same people that want to kill as many children as they can, want to euthanize the old people, and they also want access to your children and make them wear masks, make them take deadly shots, and brainwash them into lifestyles where they won't be happy or healthy or Part of a nuclear family.
[00:15:54.436 --> 00:15:57.176]  Whether it's the Democratic Party, Black Lives Matter, Hollywood, doesn't matter.
[00:15:57.196 --> 00:15:59.877]  They're all at war with the family.
[00:15:59.937 --> 00:16:06.718]  And all over D.C., all over California, all over different parts of the nation, there were riots last night and police being attacked.
[00:16:06.758 --> 00:16:13.580]  And police trying to apprehend violent people being run off by mobs that attacked them by the Communist Party.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:19.561]  They're waving the flags as law and order breaks down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:28.676]  And the police, in the video you're seeing, with their squad cars being attacked, later had to retreat and the cars were destroyed.
[00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:33.159]  This is just a small smattering of the footage that we have.
[00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:40.906]  But let's look at Pocahontas, Elizabeth Warren, the big liar.
[00:16:42.287 --> 00:16:49.553]  She shows up in D.C., starts calling for insurrection, starts calling for violence, starts calling for confronting people, going after them.
[00:16:49.933 --> 00:16:53.423]   Same thing that Maxine Waters and others did.
[00:16:53.444 --> 00:16:58.710]  And when she does it, it's good.
[00:16:59.991 --> 00:17:01.393]  When she does it, it's wonderful.
[00:17:03.424 --> 00:17:07.145]  I mean, Democrats' rhetoric calling for violence has been 100 to 1.
[00:17:07.705 --> 00:17:19.329]  Their violence burning down billions of dollars of people's homes and businesses and killing dozens and dozens of people including police officers and attacking and burning down federal buildings and firebombing other federal facilities, courthouses.
[00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:28.292]  And that's all just back burner and then vice presidential candidate raises millions of dollars and bails people out and then the district attorneys in those cities drop the charges.
[00:17:29.943 --> 00:17:31.404]  The Justice Department doesn't bring charges.
[00:17:31.684 --> 00:17:34.525]  Oh, you just attacked federal officers with a hatchet.
[00:17:34.545 --> 00:17:37.066]  You just threw Molotov cocktails at them that hit them.
[00:17:38.087 --> 00:17:41.168]  You just set fires to the building 100 plus days straight.
[00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:43.807]  But that's okay because you're a Democrat.
[00:17:43.807 --> 00:17:52.846]  Oh, but people being waved into the Capitol by police.
[00:17:53.053 --> 00:17:54.834]  Some of them are still in solitary confinement.
[00:17:56.415 --> 00:17:58.756]  So here's Elizabeth Warren coming out and running her mouth.
[00:18:01.308 --> 00:18:05.312]  Calling for an escalation of tension and the pro-lifers don't assault her.
[00:18:05.893 --> 00:18:06.534]  They don't attack her.
[00:18:06.554 --> 00:18:10.018]  They simply confront her with words and she runs like the rat she is.
[00:18:12.165 --> 00:18:20.269]  We don't want to dismember children in the womb, ma'am.
[00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:23.030]  Thank you, Senator.
[00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.730]  Thank you, Senator.
[00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:28.509]   Of course, Roe v. Wade- We don't want to dismember children in
[00:18:28.509 --> 00:18:29.509]  the womb, ma'am. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator.
[00:18:29.509 --> 00:18:30.509]   No, we are not going to stand or dismember 3,000 children in the womb every single day.
[00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:32.159]   Disgusting. Get out of the room, get out of the room, get out of the way of the car. >> You don't have a mask on
[00:18:32.159 --> 00:18:32.509]  either, ma'am.
[00:18:32.509 --> 00:18:50.129]   You're a freaking bad victim. How dare you assume I- >> Now, you couldn't pull up to a group of Democrats if you
[00:18:50.129 --> 00:19:00.269]   were a Republican senator and get out and talk, much less yell at them.
[00:19:00.304 --> 00:19:00.824]  They'd kill you.
[00:19:01.885 --> 00:19:02.305]  They'd kill you.
[00:19:04.706 --> 00:19:11.013]   But she pulls up in a group of conservative Christians and pro-lifers and Talks about we're going to fight and we're going to get in people's faces.
[00:19:11.153 --> 00:19:12.733]  There's a longer clip of her out there babbling.
[00:19:12.773 --> 00:19:14.714]  We'll come back and play more of that.
[00:19:14.754 --> 00:19:16.094]  I thought I'd send you guys a longer clip.
[00:19:16.114 --> 00:19:23.536]  There's more of her speech where she gets more into calling for violence and confronting people and getting in people's faces and going into the government buildings.
[00:19:23.857 --> 00:19:26.777]  I mean, you know the sit-ins they do and all the things they've done.
[00:19:28.278 --> 00:19:30.218]  And when a conservative does it, it's the end of the world.
[00:19:31.259 --> 00:19:32.899]  When they do it, it's just par for the course.
[00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:38.261]  So think about who these people are and what they stand for and where they're going.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.982]  But I've got some really important news we're going to get to continuing on this front.
[00:19:43.543 --> 00:19:49.767]  MSNBC talking head labels founding fathers racist, misogynist, jerk faces.
[00:19:49.807 --> 00:19:51.949]  We've got that coming up next segment.
[00:19:52.989 --> 00:19:58.693]  Tucker Carlson reminds America that its current president voted against Roe v. Wade.
[00:19:58.793 --> 00:20:00.094]  Oh, that's how long Biden's been around.
[00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:06.118]  Leftist news outlet advocates using horse medication for do-it-yourself abortions.
[00:20:06.258 --> 00:20:06.919]  Very dangerous.
[00:20:08.988 --> 00:20:09.908]  Civility restored.
[00:20:09.948 --> 00:20:14.070]  Hillary Clinton says Alito draft opinion will kill and subjugate women.
[00:20:15.351 --> 00:20:17.972]  No, it'll actually kill women to keep abortion going.
[00:20:18.952 --> 00:20:20.053]  Amazon to pay U.S.
[00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:22.374]  employees up to $4,000 to travel for abortions.
[00:20:26.276 --> 00:20:29.297]  So much to get to on that front.
[00:20:31.786 --> 00:20:35.068]  Dem Senator Ed Markey says Supreme Court is illegitimate.
[00:20:35.648 --> 00:20:36.348]  Oh my gosh!
[00:20:36.368 --> 00:20:40.090]  Homeland Security says to say anybody in government is illegitimate is an act of terror.
[00:20:41.091 --> 00:20:44.573]  Questioning elections or government bodies is not allowed, even though of course it is.
[00:20:45.093 --> 00:20:47.314]  And he can say all day he thinks the Supreme Court is illegitimate.
[00:20:47.614 --> 00:20:48.555]  I think he's illegitimate.
[00:20:51.058 --> 00:20:52.539]  Wow, we'll cover this when we come back, too.
[00:20:52.999 --> 00:21:06.644]  Pro-life Spider-Man, free climbs, second tallest tower in California in protest of abortion, scaled a 60-plus story building freehand.
[00:21:08.405 --> 00:21:09.245]  And he got arrested.
[00:21:11.066 --> 00:21:17.749]  And a lot of folks on Twitter made the point, wow, he finally found something you can get arrested for in San Francisco.
[00:21:20.345 --> 00:21:25.650]  In San Francisco, if you shoot a white person, you will not even be charged now.
[00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:35.398]  There was a few years ago, they shot that poor woman, the Hispanic guy did, in the back because she was white, and the white jury let him off saying, well, you're Hispanic.
[00:21:35.758 --> 00:21:37.840]  Again, that's how psychotic they are there.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:41.082]  But don't worry, he's been arrested, folks, for bringing attention to saving the children.
[00:21:41.943 --> 00:21:44.786]  Thank God we're all safe right now.
[00:21:45.266 --> 00:21:46.267]  That is going to be coming up.
[00:21:47.810 --> 00:22:01.233]  And then after I finish up on this huge abortion news, and boy is there a lot of it, and is it important, we're gonna get into the biggest COVID news yet.
[00:22:01.273 --> 00:22:06.714]  It just keeps getting more and more incredible what's coming out, and what Bill Gates is up to, creeping around.
[00:22:07.234 --> 00:22:07.814]  It's not over.
[00:22:07.854 --> 00:22:11.535]  Bill Gates warns of even more fatal variant of COVID's coming.
[00:22:12.935 --> 00:22:21.202]   And of course he knows, because he paid to have it all manufactured and made, In the Wuhan lab on record.
[00:22:21.302 --> 00:22:22.683]  We have all the emails, the documents.
[00:22:23.303 --> 00:22:25.823]  They even approached the Pentagon about openly releasing it in China.
[00:22:26.844 --> 00:22:28.184]  Pentagon said that would cause a war.
[00:22:30.765 --> 00:22:33.985]  And now he's sitting there getting ready to attack you and your family again.
[00:22:37.106 --> 00:22:39.787]  So he can get even richer and depopulate the planet.
[00:22:40.467 --> 00:22:43.548]  Something he and his dad are so obsessed with.
[00:22:44.228 --> 00:22:44.808]  His whole family.
[00:22:46.121 --> 00:22:49.583]  And we have the huge news out of the Ukraine situation.
[00:22:50.063 --> 00:22:54.965]  The Pope comes out and says, looks like NATO started the war with Russia, which is true.
[00:22:54.985 --> 00:23:00.908]  I can't believe I'm agreeing with the anti-Pope, but it's true what he's saying.
[00:23:00.928 --> 00:23:02.208]  We've got that coming up as well.
[00:23:02.228 --> 00:23:02.568]  Stay with us.
[00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.191]  The globalists are making their move on humanity right now.
[00:23:09.371 --> 00:23:14.754]  You can wake up to that fact and defend yourself.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:17.821]  Or you can roll over and die.
[00:23:19.182 --> 00:23:25.646]  As for me, our amazing audience of activists, we have decided to stand our ground and fight.
[00:23:26.766 --> 00:23:30.289]  But more than just fight, we have committed to win!
[00:23:30.429 --> 00:23:32.270]  You are receiving this transmission.
[00:23:32.730 --> 00:23:34.111]  You are the resistance.
[00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:41.876]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:23:41.916 --> 00:23:43.417]  This is a battle of wills.
[00:23:46.664 --> 00:23:54.029]  George Soros, Clinton, Obama staffers and European governments are behind anti-mass campaign to force big corporations to boycott Twitter.
[00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:56.031]  Anti-Musk campaign.
[00:23:56.871 --> 00:23:58.212]  Yeah, that's breaking and we know that.
[00:23:58.292 --> 00:24:15.605]  George Soros, Clinton and Obama staffers and European governments are behind the anti-Musk campaign to force big corporations to boycott and attack the company so that it'll basically go bankrupt and Musk is forced to either leave or sell it.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.300]  That's how they operate.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:19.681]  That's actually coming up next segment.
[00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:37.708]  These very same forces have attacked us because they cannot allow any independent media outlet to be there because they'll become so popular and then others will imitate that popularity and then we will build a community based on common sense and based on the knowledge of the crowd with what the people want to hear and want to know the truth.
[00:24:39.229 --> 00:24:40.329]  It's quite a fundamental battle.
[00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.591]  Now here's Biden today at a press conference.
[00:24:45.387 --> 00:24:51.112]  Talking about Make America Great Again movement is the most dangerous radical movement in U.S.
[00:24:51.132 --> 00:24:51.473]  history.
[00:24:53.174 --> 00:24:55.176]  So it's more dangerous than the KKK.
[00:24:56.738 --> 00:24:58.760]  It's more dangerous than the new Black Panther Party.
[00:24:59.961 --> 00:25:04.485]  It's more dangerous than MS-13, that's a political, really paramilitary movement.
[00:25:04.985 --> 00:25:06.427]  It's more dangerous than the Communist Party.
[00:25:08.663 --> 00:25:09.783]  Make America Great Again.
[00:25:10.364 --> 00:25:12.464]  Lowest crime rate you can imagine at his events.
[00:25:13.165 --> 00:25:15.206]  Good hard working people, very race, color, and creed.
[00:25:16.286 --> 00:25:21.068]  Simply wanting sovereignty and low taxes and fair trade deals.
[00:25:23.117 --> 00:25:25.459]  The people that support Trump are the very best in the world.
[00:25:25.819 --> 00:25:27.520]  And the movement is excellent.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:33.584]  And Trump's getting a lot of good nationalists and populists elected all over the country.
[00:25:34.224 --> 00:25:40.108]  And he's not perfect, but they hate him because they know he's effective in energizing the populist awakening.
[00:25:41.269 --> 00:25:41.769]  Listen to this.
[00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:47.053]  Clean sweep all 22 Trump-backed candidates win primaries in Ohio and Indiana.
[00:25:47.433 --> 00:25:47.573]  All 22.
[00:25:50.285 --> 00:25:53.227]  He's endorsed close to a thousand candidates and two have lost.
[00:25:55.509 --> 00:25:55.989]  Unbelievable.
[00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:56.990]  Track record.
[00:25:58.311 --> 00:25:58.951]  And it scares him.
[00:26:03.275 --> 00:26:19.426]  But here's that quote that I was just talking about with Biden saying that, that movement, you, aren't just deplorable like Hillary Clinton said, you are the most dangerous, radical, evil people in American history.
[00:26:19.466 --> 00:26:19.847]  Here it is.
[00:26:20.894 --> 00:26:21.595]  Struck down.
[00:26:21.995 --> 00:26:25.458]  Griswold was thought to be a bad decision by Borken.
[00:26:25.918 --> 00:26:28.220]  My guess is the guy's on the Supreme Court now.
[00:26:29.121 --> 00:26:38.529]  What happens if you have a state change the law saying that children who are LGBTQ can't be in classrooms with other children?
[00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:43.773]  Is that legit under the way the decision is written?
[00:26:44.918 --> 00:26:47.260]  What are the next things that are going to be attacked?
[00:26:48.041 --> 00:26:54.347]  Because this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization that's existed in American history.
[00:26:56.529 --> 00:27:12.756]   You know, as stunning as the lie to say that we're the most radical organization ever in American history, I mean, the Founding Fathers went around signing death warrants, killing British officers, and burning down shipyards, and assassinating people all over the place.
[00:27:12.776 --> 00:27:14.818]  So they were the most radical in American history.
[00:27:14.858 --> 00:27:23.746]  For good, to compare our revolution of peace and information to say that we're the most radical, we're wimps compared to the Founding Fathers.
[00:27:23.766 --> 00:27:25.087]  And I'm not saying go out and be violent.
[00:27:26.437 --> 00:27:30.580]  My point is, is that the idea that we are the most radical is preposterous.
[00:27:31.141 --> 00:27:37.886]  Some of the founding fathers had their wives and children kidnapped and put on prison ships, and the founders just let them starve to death on board.
[00:27:39.187 --> 00:27:40.348]  Okay, you want me to give up?
[00:27:40.368 --> 00:27:41.268]  You got my wife and children?
[00:27:41.209 --> 00:27:50.929]   let him starve to death. Andrew Jackson was 11 to 15 during the Revolutionary
[00:27:50.929 --> 00:27:53.968]  War at the time he was involved.
[00:27:53.388 --> 00:27:56.829]  As a spy and as a message runner and later as a sniper.
[00:27:58.310 --> 00:28:04.932]  And they grabbed his mother and his older brother and said that if he and others didn't come turn themselves in, they'd be starved to death.
[00:28:05.932 --> 00:28:09.013]  Andrew Jackson didn't turn himself in, his mother and brother starved to death.
[00:28:09.553 --> 00:28:12.114]  We are not one-tenth as tough as those people.
[00:28:16.275 --> 00:28:16.795]  Think about that.
[00:28:20.396 --> 00:28:22.077]  So that's the type of stuff that went on back then.
[00:28:23.477 --> 00:28:25.319]  And to compare us to them, we don't even deserve it.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.561]  Now, I'm going to stop right there.
[00:28:28.643 --> 00:28:34.489]  But to compare the modern patriots to the left is like comparing us to the founders.
[00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:40.676]  So even though we're not as hard and strong and focused as they were, we're still light years better than the left, thank God.
[00:28:42.438 --> 00:28:45.161]  So you just heard that incredible clip, but what's more incredible there?
[00:28:46.707 --> 00:28:53.890]  The L-B-G-T-Q-P-X-Y-Z-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-X-U-T.
[00:28:57.251 --> 00:28:59.032]  What about the LGBT students?
[00:28:59.432 --> 00:29:02.593]  You know what goes on in Austin at the middle schools and high schools and elementaries?
[00:29:03.874 --> 00:29:05.834]  They tell them, you identify as LGBT, don't you?
[00:29:05.874 --> 00:29:06.755]  Here's a lollipop.
[00:29:07.275 --> 00:29:09.956]  When they do, they pat them on the head and let them have extra recess time.
[00:29:11.291 --> 00:29:17.399]  And they're organized into after-school clubs and everything else, literally into a sexual orientation and a sexual lifestyle.
[00:29:17.679 --> 00:29:18.700]  Imagine if they had the...
[00:29:20.143 --> 00:29:55.783]   Mud wrestling team for five-year-olds or the oil wrestling or hey, let's let's hey You're part of the wet t-shirt contest group and you're training to wear wet t-shirts Contest you'd say that's pedophilia that sexualization children, but if it's if it's LGBT, it's like oh absolutely Let's go confuse these kids that are highly influenceable with their leaders with their teachers and then let's induct them into this lifestyle and Yeah, 4,000% increase the last decade in kids identifying as trans, but nobody is grooming the children.
[00:29:57.344 --> 00:30:00.065]  They're not grooming them, they're forcing them the hell into it.
[00:30:00.685 --> 00:30:03.367]  This is a cult of depopulation taking over.
[00:30:06.528 --> 00:30:10.995]   And when you look at the cult, they all look like They've had their souls sucked out of them.
[00:30:11.016 --> 00:30:12.657]  I don't care if they're black, white, what color they are.
[00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:14.059]  They all look like hell.
[00:30:14.139 --> 00:30:15.800]  We don't want to have our children anywhere near this.
[00:30:15.961 --> 00:30:20.961]   And if you let your children anywhere near the public schools, you are insane.
[00:30:20.961 --> 00:30:31.961]  Baby torture, taken hostage and battered with tuna fins.
[00:30:32.426 --> 00:30:39.631]  After leaving son without legs, fellow inmates took him hostage and threatened to chop off his legs once they knew what he'd done.
[00:30:42.553 --> 00:30:48.553]   Yeah, the inmates know what to do, but not the liberals, why they'd have him there for drag queen story time.
[00:30:48.553 --> 00:30:55.513]  So you just heard the president of the United States.
[00:30:55.513 --> 00:31:05.513]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.780]  It's always groping and grabbing children on television.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.501]  Tell you, well, we gotta protect the LGBT children?
[00:31:02.521 --> 00:31:08.522]  Imagine somebody saying, we gotta protect the heterosexual children that are in the sex club.
[00:31:09.842 --> 00:31:10.842]  It's a sex club!
[00:31:14.723 --> 00:31:20.084]  And it's a bunch of weird, child-grooming pedophiles and perverts wanting access to your children.
[00:31:20.144 --> 00:31:21.524]  They are the pedophile movement.
[00:31:21.964 --> 00:31:24.805]  Oh, but CNN tells you there's no pedophile epidemic.
[00:31:24.825 --> 00:31:26.005]  Even though there is.
[00:31:27.961 --> 00:31:29.882]  And they have all these useful idiots that go along with it.
[00:31:30.343 --> 00:31:31.343]  Absolutely insane.
[00:31:34.345 --> 00:31:35.766]  I want to get more into the abortion stuff.
[00:31:37.187 --> 00:31:40.569]  And then I want to get into a bunch of news and take your calls next hour.
[00:31:40.589 --> 00:31:46.032]  And then Pete Santilli is going to join us on something we've talked a lot about but we need to really drill into because it's such a big deal.
[00:31:48.514 --> 00:31:53.938]  World Health Organization, global government takeover with this new treaty set to be ratified and prepared this month.
[00:31:55.169 --> 00:31:56.250]  In Switzerland.
[00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:58.111]  This is a big, big deal.
[00:31:58.131 --> 00:31:59.713]  We're going to go through it piece by piece.
[00:32:00.093 --> 00:32:06.378]  And how Obama set the stage for it back in the final days of his administration with executive orders.
[00:32:06.438 --> 00:32:10.060]  Now that ties into executive orders of George W. Bush in 2005.
[00:32:12.402 --> 00:32:14.844]  And how this is their big medical takeover plan.
[00:32:15.505 --> 00:32:21.569]  Nationally, they'll use federal agencies to use medical takeover to seize control of housing, infrastructure, forced evacuations.
[00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:23.371]  Internationally, same thing.
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:27.582]  We'll be hitting all of that coming up on the other side.
[00:32:27.662 --> 00:32:33.205]  So much big news for you today, but we must guard our children, and we must do it now.
[00:32:34.066 --> 00:32:36.828]  The target is our children, not just their innocence, but their lives.
[00:32:37.148 --> 00:32:39.749]  If they can kill them before they're born and chop them up, that's the best.
[00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:41.971]  Sell their organs, that's even better.
[00:32:43.152 --> 00:32:45.473]  Or, they gotta sterilize them and turn them into pedophiles.
[00:32:45.493 --> 00:32:46.294]  That's the next target.
[00:32:46.153 --> 00:32:47.513]  If they can't, just kill them.
[00:32:47.513 --> 00:32:48.394]  We'll be right back.
[00:32:48.394 --> 00:33:05.913]  [Outro Music]
[00:33:05.816 --> 00:33:07.816]  And what's really in those shots?
[00:33:07.816 --> 00:33:17.476]   That's far away How we supposed to get there with the way that we're living
[00:33:17.476 --> 00:33:23.576]   today You talk lots about God
[00:33:23.576 --> 00:33:32.335]   Freedom comes from the call That's not what this bitch wants
[00:33:32.335 --> 00:33:35.298]   No They're here.
[00:33:35.177 --> 00:33:53.177]   I want money, power and glory I want money, power and glory
[00:33:53.177 --> 00:34:10.177]   Hallelujah, I'm gonna take you for what you got Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for what they got
[00:34:10.177 --> 00:34:17.263]   I want money, power and glory I'll give the number out at the end of this segment.
[00:34:18.463 --> 00:34:33.101]   I intend to take a lot of calls in the second hour and intersperse with a ton of very important news and some very important Many reports that we have been putting out just in the last 24 hours that we're going to be premiering here on air in the next hour.
[00:34:33.121 --> 00:34:39.083]  I wanted to, before I forget, just remind listeners of something.
[00:34:39.943 --> 00:34:41.984]  And the corporate media spends this all day.
[00:34:44.525 --> 00:34:48.326]  We were given a $1 million roughly Bitcoin donation a week ago.
[00:34:48.346 --> 00:34:51.327]  I came on air and said we just got a big donation.
[00:34:52.407 --> 00:34:58.966]   So we've gone from being 40% behind To about 65-70% being covered.
[00:35:00.027 --> 00:35:03.910]  When we get to 100% of what we need, we're now in the black.
[00:35:04.991 --> 00:35:06.452]  That's what I'm explaining as we're treading water.
[00:35:07.433 --> 00:35:10.335]  And the media all spun that like it was some secret and it was evil.
[00:35:10.355 --> 00:35:11.516]  You're not allowed to take Bitcoin.
[00:35:11.536 --> 00:35:12.477]  You're not allowed to sell product.
[00:35:12.497 --> 00:35:13.378]  You're not allowed to be on air.
[00:35:13.698 --> 00:35:14.939]  Everything we do is evil, evil, evil.
[00:35:15.139 --> 00:35:18.122]  When they're the ones that are saying they want to kill babies after they're born.
[00:35:19.343 --> 00:35:20.543]  They're the ones promoting pedophilia.
[00:35:20.563 --> 00:35:21.364]  They're the bad guys.
[00:35:21.804 --> 00:35:25.825]  But everything we do is evil and terrible, and even being masculine is bad.
[00:35:25.865 --> 00:35:30.686]  And the American Psychological Association says that masculinity is evil, is mental illness.
[00:35:31.466 --> 00:35:32.407]  No, that's mental illness!
[00:35:32.927 --> 00:35:38.248]  Saying a woman can be a man, a man can be a woman, or saying a man can have a baby.
[00:35:39.909 --> 00:35:41.669]  It's all a fraud, ladies and gentlemen, and we know that.
[00:35:43.089 --> 00:35:44.250]  But I want to be very clear with the listeners.
[00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:48.531]  I told you months ago we had a two and a half million dollar deficit.
[00:35:49.943 --> 00:35:52.945]  Because it costs us millions and millions and millions of dollars a year just for bandwidth.
[00:35:53.406 --> 00:35:55.828]  Because we have to do our own streaming, our own systems, because we're independent.
[00:35:56.348 --> 00:35:56.949]  Just that alone.
[00:35:56.989 --> 00:36:03.334]  But I have to be able to buy product out in the future, show that we can then sell product to make the profit to fund the operation.
[00:36:04.875 --> 00:36:07.817]  And so $5 million with inflation is not a lot of money.
[00:36:08.118 --> 00:36:10.920]  That's barely what I need to go to make the decision.
[00:36:12.042 --> 00:36:15.703]  To go ahead and buy the product we need for six months out.
[00:36:15.843 --> 00:36:18.764]  Because used to it was six weeks, then 12 weeks, then 20 weeks.
[00:36:19.164 --> 00:36:21.585]  We've put orders in that took a year to come in.
[00:36:21.605 --> 00:36:29.067]  I know anybody that's involved in manufacturing, or food production, or supplements, or medicine, everybody knows this is happening.
[00:36:29.467 --> 00:36:31.928]  And it's getting worse and worse around the world, and now worse and worse here.
[00:36:31.968 --> 00:36:35.609]  So, we're in a critical situation.
[00:36:35.969 --> 00:36:43.696]   So I want to thank that great donor for taking us from the red, where I didn't know what to do, To right into the edge of the black.
[00:36:43.756 --> 00:36:45.497]  But I don't want to sink back down to the red.
[00:36:45.537 --> 00:36:46.438]  So I want listeners to understand.

[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:26.100]  Box.

[00:37:28.241 --> 00:37:28.801]  Box, please?
[00:37:30.101 --> 00:37:32.562]  That I had you guys write up for me a little plug for that.
[00:37:32.582 --> 00:37:35.684]  Because people are sending a lot of donations to the P.O.
[00:37:35.704 --> 00:37:36.504]  Box as well.

[00:38:01.318 --> 00:38:02.079]  Box is P.O.
[00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:06.363]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:38:07.364 --> 00:38:12.230]  If you'd like to order a product by mail, or if you'd like to make a straight donation via mail, thank you so much.
[00:38:12.270 --> 00:38:12.450]  P.O.
[00:38:12.490 --> 00:38:15.693]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760.
[00:38:16.875 --> 00:38:20.458]  You know who you are, and I really want to thank you all for your support.
[00:38:20.478 --> 00:38:21.299]  We couldn't do it without you.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:30.686]  As soon as I announced last week, and I appreciate the support, that, oh, we got $2 million in donations, we got a second donation, I saw support go way down.
[00:38:30.947 --> 00:38:32.448]  People are like, oh, well, Jones is fine now.
[00:38:32.528 --> 00:38:39.313]  No, we just got fuel in the tank to not be on empty, and if we don't keep promoting and all this, we're going to lose.
[00:38:39.333 --> 00:38:40.894]  We're fighting the Democrats at point blank range.
[00:38:41.315 --> 00:38:42.295]  We're fighting the corrupt courts.
[00:38:42.315 --> 00:38:44.817]  We're paying for our own bandwidth, our own satellite uplinks.
[00:38:45.338 --> 00:38:49.378]   this crew this is a very important organization and we've got some major
[00:38:49.378 --> 00:38:53.617]   moves taking place with people that want to partner with us to take it to the
[00:38:53.617 --> 00:39:00.057]   next level and so the enemy's attacks on us are gonna blow up in their face but
[00:39:00.057 --> 00:39:05.298]   we've got to be able to persevere and and and hold where we are another six
[00:39:05.298 --> 00:39:15.898]   months or so and just to give you a report on what's happening people are
[00:39:15.898 --> 00:39:20.179]   really upset now And folks are really waking up to the new world order being a real thing.
[00:39:20.981 --> 00:39:23.546]  And so the credibility of InfoWars has absolutely exploded.
[00:39:23.987 --> 00:39:26.492]  But that's created something extremely paradoxical.
[00:39:28.302 --> 00:39:40.852]  Whereas we get more popular with Christians and nationalists and populists and people that just want to survive and live and just pro-human folks, pro-common sense people, the satanic forces get more and more enraged and intensify their attacks.
[00:39:41.473 --> 00:39:45.636]  And then that only makes people that are already awake say, hey, we better check out InfoWars more.
[00:39:45.656 --> 00:39:59.463]   So it's creating an amplification loop that is extremely explosive politically, spiritually, like firing a bullet of uranium into a block of solid plutonium.
[00:39:59.463 --> 00:40:08.603]   And that's what many of your more primitive atomic and even hydrogen bombs are detonated with
[00:40:08.603 --> 00:40:13.023]   is not just plastic explosive, and this is an allegory, it's an analogy,
[00:40:13.023 --> 00:40:19.943]   is by firing that radioactive bullet into the solid core of the plutonium,
[00:40:19.943 --> 00:40:22.304]  and vice versa.
[00:40:22.304 --> 00:40:24.824]  There's multiple ways to do it.
[00:40:24.824 --> 00:40:32.983]   And so this, I'm writing a bomb down just like Ian "Dr. Strange" Love, and I know that.
[00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:35.298]  This is extremely historic, what we're all going through.
[00:40:36.398 --> 00:40:39.019]  And they can't deny they're Satanists now.
[00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:40.580]  They can't deny they're pedophiles now.
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.641]  They can't deny they're devaluing the currency.
[00:40:43.021 --> 00:40:44.682]  They can't deny they're starting a war with Russia.
[00:40:45.041 --> 00:40:52.721]   They can't deny that they are just the most horrible, evil, lying, scum of the earth people
[00:40:52.721 --> 00:40:56.880]  that are surveilling us and censoring us and attacking us.
[00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:01.481]   And it's just going to get more and more intense until people finally have to stand up and
[00:41:01.481 --> 00:41:03.362]  stop complying and say no.
[00:41:03.362 --> 00:41:05.041]  And the globalists know you're already doing that.
[00:41:05.041 --> 00:41:07.181]  They can see they're going to lose.
[00:41:07.181 --> 00:41:09.521]  So they want violence.
[00:41:09.521 --> 00:41:11.081]  That's why we can't be rubbed into it.
[00:41:11.081 --> 00:41:12.802]  We can't be set up by it.
[00:41:12.802 --> 00:41:19.882]   We have to be as wise as serpents and as peaceful as doves and as Teddy Roosevelt said, walk
[00:41:19.882 --> 00:41:26.641]   quietly, carry a big stick and work as hard as we can now before they go to their next
[00:41:27.025 --> 00:41:39.655]  Because when Biden tells you the most radical organization, the most evil organization in American history is the Make America Great Again crowd, you know they're coming for everybody.
[00:41:39.715 --> 00:41:40.315]  Because they have to.
[00:41:40.776 --> 00:41:41.536]  They've lost.
[00:41:42.157 --> 00:41:43.077]  People know who they are.
[00:41:43.558 --> 00:41:44.639]  Everyone's turning against them.
[00:41:45.501 --> 00:41:49.402]  And so all they have now is election fraud and then gaslighting, just like France.
[00:41:49.622 --> 00:41:50.102]  Oh no!
[00:41:51.263 --> 00:41:52.663]  Biden really got re-elected.
[00:41:54.403 --> 00:41:54.864]  Oh no!
[00:41:55.744 --> 00:41:57.284]  Everyone really loves Kamala Harris.
[00:41:57.364 --> 00:42:00.965]  Even though the polls will show the opposite, this is part of the gaslighting.
[00:42:01.005 --> 00:42:02.406]  So I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:42:03.586 --> 00:42:10.788]  We'll start the next hour and I'm going to finish up on the abortion freakout and where I see that going.
[00:42:11.248 --> 00:42:14.967]   And then just this massive, massive developments of the COVID front.
[00:42:14.967 --> 00:42:21.367]   And then when I say huge, the situation with the ongoing NATO-Russia war,
[00:42:21.367 --> 00:42:25.648]   and what General Milley had to say about wanting to put US troops in there
[00:42:25.648 --> 00:42:28.327]  and have permanent bases surrounding Russia.
[00:42:28.327 --> 00:42:30.208]  I wanna show you some of the maps.
[00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:34.688]   And just, this is a serious provocation and it shows you where the future is going.
[00:42:34.688 --> 00:42:37.528]  That's all coming up.
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.820]  But don't forget, Biden said this.
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:51.162]  The idea that we're going to make a judgment that is going to say that no one can make a judgment to choose to abort a child based on a decision by the Supreme Court, I think goes way overboard.
[00:42:51.643 --> 00:42:53.363]  Biden said Tuesday, emphasis added.
[00:42:54.023 --> 00:42:57.224]  If the decision holds, it really is quite a radical decision.
[00:42:58.404 --> 00:42:59.644]  That is upside down world.
[00:43:01.864 --> 00:43:04.725]  Killing babies up at the time they're born and then after.
[00:43:06.046 --> 00:43:13.725]   Democrat controlled areas Is not radical not wanting to kill babies is radical. Oh
[00:43:13.725 --> 00:43:19.756]   But they don't want met Democrats don't want medical experiments on rats. They just want your children chopped
[00:43:19.756 --> 00:43:23.146]   up These people are a criminal mob stay with us
[00:43:23.146 --> 00:43:33.546]   there's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example
[00:43:33.546 --> 00:43:42.186]   Alex Jones the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently
[00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:50.257]   Alex Jones Scum!
[00:43:52.539 --> 00:43:54.601]  Russian scum!
[00:43:54.702 --> 00:44:00.007]  Until worse comes to mind.
[00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:05.571]  Your reputation's amazing.
[00:44:06.011 --> 00:44:07.072]  I will not let you down.
[00:44:07.092 --> 00:44:08.453]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:44:08.273 --> 00:44:11.033]  I'm very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:44:11.033 --> 00:44:13.773]  (crowd cheering)
[00:44:13.773 --> 00:44:18.593]  (upbeat music)
[00:44:18.593 --> 00:44:23.833]   For the remainder of 2022, food at home prices are predicted to increase
[00:44:23.833 --> 00:44:25.932]  between five and 6%.
[00:44:25.932 --> 00:44:33.791]   And food away from home prices, restaurants, are predicted to increase between 5.5 and 6.5%.
[00:44:33.791 --> 00:44:38.952]   Earlier this year, the USDA predicted food prices would increase five and six percent.
[00:44:39.033 --> 00:44:44.155]  The price of meats like beef and chicken increased by 1 percent or more between February and March.
[00:44:44.575 --> 00:44:48.916]  McMullen says eggs used to be $1.29 a dozen for large eggs, but now?
[00:44:49.416 --> 00:44:50.717]  They're almost $3 a carton.
[00:44:52.737 --> 00:45:08.162]  Thirty percent of the world's wheat production, if that goes unplanted in the Ukraine, and corn, and other things, that, you know, our world is very, it's on, it's a very tight balance.
[00:45:08.703 --> 00:45:12.924]  And if we interrupt the food production, we will have a food crisis.
[00:45:13.324 --> 00:45:15.345]  Prices will go through the roof.
[00:45:15.625 --> 00:45:18.126]  We can afford it as a rich country, we're so abundant.
[00:45:18.666 --> 00:45:21.449]  But other countries unfortunately will not.
[00:45:21.909 --> 00:45:25.813]  And we will be the last ones affected, but like Marie Antoinette said, let them eat cake.
[00:45:26.094 --> 00:45:36.625]  Meanwhile, dozens of food processing facilities have been damaged or destroyed in fires, plane crashes, and other ominous incidents across the United States.
[00:45:37.185 --> 00:45:38.206]  Everybody's concerned.
[00:45:38.807 --> 00:45:40.388]  Nobody knows what the future holds.
[00:45:40.768 --> 00:45:47.414]  Uncertainty consumes the employees of an Eastern Oregon food processing plant decimated by a fire earlier in the week.
[00:45:47.814 --> 00:45:52.158]  While gas prices pummel the middle class dining room table.
[00:45:52.298 --> 00:45:59.684]  The cost of fuel for agricultural aircraft that is used for planting crops has actually tripled since last year.
[00:46:00.165 --> 00:46:03.668]  Supply chain issues also making nitrogen fertilizers more expensive.
[00:46:04.028 --> 00:46:11.235]   Anywhere from Say two to three hundred dollars to a thousand dollars more a load going across the country.
[00:46:11.535 --> 00:46:19.862]  Add that to already increasing prices due to inflation, supply chain issues, and trucker shortages, and that could all lead to sticker shock at grocery stores.
[00:46:20.063 --> 00:46:23.526]  Rents reach unsustainable levels nationwide.
[00:46:23.866 --> 00:46:29.513]  Supply and demand problems in the housing industry is having a huge ripple effect on renters.
[00:46:29.854 --> 00:46:32.917]  With home prices soaring, it's forcing many people to rent.
[00:46:33.358 --> 00:46:35.761]  On average, across the country, rent is up nearly 20%.
[00:46:37.103 --> 00:46:43.490]   In one Florida city, a woman's rent is going from $1,700 a month to $3,500 a month.
[00:46:43.530 --> 00:46:46.013]  There are several factors for the big increase.
[00:46:46.373 --> 00:46:50.098]  Mortgage rates are above 5% for the first time since 2010.
[00:46:50.498 --> 00:46:54.543]  Construction costs are high and that's in part because of supply chain issues.
[00:46:54.923 --> 00:47:05.765]  You would think that all of these simultaneous crises occurring within the United States would be met with the vigor of a deeply concerned United States President.
[00:47:05.985 --> 00:47:20.690]   But America is supposed to assume that this senile, useless pervert donning a jacked up bow tie is merely incompetent and somehow inherited this whole mess from the previous administration And a war a world away.
[00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:25.874]  I'm really excited to be here tonight with the only group of Americans with a lower approval rating than I have.
[00:47:28.637 --> 00:47:31.299]  I think ever since you've come into office, things are really looking up.
[00:47:31.899 --> 00:47:34.061]  You know, gas is up, rent is up, food is up.
[00:47:35.182 --> 00:47:35.603]  Everything.
[00:47:36.744 --> 00:47:37.624]  No, it really has been.
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.322]  A tough first year for you, Mr. President.
[00:47:40.481 --> 00:47:48.081]   This Nero 2.0-esque laugh by world government operative Joe Biden as America suffers from
[00:47:48.081 --> 00:47:54.320]   his handler's controlled folly while guided by the minions of globalization is a scene
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:48:03.802]  straight from the inner sanctum of Skeletor.
[00:48:03.802 --> 00:48:09.320]   This will go down in history as the moment the gauntlet was thrown down as American Providence
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:13.961]  was officially challenged and treason hit the boiling point.
[00:48:14.324 --> 00:48:21.324]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:48:21.324 --> 00:48:28.204]   For anybody that studied history, you read about these times.
[00:48:28.204 --> 00:48:38.202]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:48:29.718 --> 00:48:43.401]  Where the archaeologists dig up the ruins of these towns and cities and cultures, and there'll be periods of hundreds of years of peace and prosperity and building up the culture from agrarian to complex city-states.
[00:48:44.542 --> 00:48:54.324]  And then all of a sudden, corruption sets in, and decadence, and sex cults, and people start cheating on their husbands and wives.
[00:48:55.492 --> 00:49:12.922]  And then men start having sex with men and women with women and then people can become obsessed with that and then there's no more confidence and no more family and then either outside groups invade and take them over or they start human sacrifice and start killing each other until the civilization collapses.
[00:49:15.143 --> 00:49:21.547]  It's a well-known fact of civilization that sex with children is the hallmark of the end of the culture.
[00:49:23.118 --> 00:49:30.685]  And we are right back where we were in this cycle that's happened many, many times in recorded U.S.
[00:49:30.725 --> 00:49:32.947]  history, and God knows, before that.
[00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:50.062]  There is something anti-human that pushes this, first in very small groups, and those groups build and recruit, then they take over, and then they try to force everyone to live like them, and society destroys itself.
[00:49:54.301 --> 00:49:55.221]  And it's repeating itself.
[00:49:56.422 --> 00:49:59.843]  War, famine, currency devaluation.
[00:50:00.623 --> 00:50:06.405]  Look at these headlines when we're dealing with the situation in Europe.
[00:50:07.385 --> 00:50:14.247]  General Milley warns Congress, quote, chances of war among great powers increasing, not decreasing.
[00:50:14.467 --> 00:50:17.608]  And he went on to say that the U.S.
[00:50:17.648 --> 00:50:24.358]   should weigh building permanent bases In Eastern Europe.
[00:50:25.679 --> 00:50:27.220]  Talk about a massive provocation.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:32.222]  They went on to also say they're looking at getting Ukraine to join NATO.
[00:50:33.803 --> 00:50:36.184]  Which Russia said they were secretly already planning to do.
[00:50:37.325 --> 00:50:39.386]  They were launching military attacks on them.
[00:50:43.468 --> 00:50:47.096]   That NATO was And so that they were going to invade if the U.S.
[00:50:47.136 --> 00:50:47.677]  didn't stop.
[00:50:48.157 --> 00:50:51.397]  And so why is the Pope now suddenly telling the truth?
[00:50:51.978 --> 00:50:58.719]  Pope Francis says NATO may have provoked Russia's invasion of Ukraine, hopes to meet Putin in Moscow.
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:06.941]  Goes on to blame the weapons manufacturers and says that they are the ones that stand to gain, they're endangering the world.
[00:51:07.381 --> 00:51:08.982]  What happened to the Pope suddenly?
[00:51:09.002 --> 00:51:17.604]   Because almost everything he says is evil and wrong and ass backwards from just saying What somebody like Pope John Paul II would say.
[00:51:18.844 --> 00:51:23.866]  Almost everything I ever read that guy said made perfect sense and he fought communism and was a good guy and pro-life and pro-family.
[00:51:24.446 --> 00:51:25.486]  What's going on with this guy?
[00:51:25.886 --> 00:51:30.528]  Because you can't say like one's good and the other one's good when they're polar opposites.
[00:51:32.426 --> 00:51:33.127]  I'm not a Catholic.
[00:51:33.147 --> 00:51:41.053]  A lot of the Catholics are good people on average and have a long history in Christendom, and I want it to be a good, strong Christian institution.
[00:51:42.053 --> 00:51:44.655]  But under this Pope, it has been the opposite of that, hasn't it?
[00:51:44.675 --> 00:51:45.716]  I don't think that's debatable.
[00:51:46.096 --> 00:51:47.658]  I know the Catholics are up in arms about it.
[00:51:48.818 --> 00:51:49.959]  What is this statement about?
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:58.346]  Pope Francis says NATO may have provoked Russian invasion of Ukraine, hopes to meet Putin in Moscow.
[00:51:59.841 --> 00:52:10.873]  Pope Francis participated in an interview Monday with one of the largest Italian daily newspapers where the Vatican head expressed his desire to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the near future.
[00:52:12.354 --> 00:52:23.839]   I asked Cardinal Perloni After 20 days of war, to send a message to Putin to say that I was willing to go to Moscow, the Pope said, we have not yet received an answer.
[00:52:24.219 --> 00:52:30.123]  And we are still insisting, even if I fear that Putin cannot and does not want to have this meeting at the time.
[00:52:30.483 --> 00:52:34.265]  But how can this brutality not be stopped?
[00:52:34.285 --> 00:52:36.987]  25 years ago, we experienced the same thing in Rwanda.
[00:52:39.002 --> 00:52:51.393]  He went on to blame the weapons manufacturers and the fact that NATO overthrew the government, the elected government in Ukraine eight years ago, and you know the rest of the story, and then started launching attacks on Russian-held areas.
[00:52:53.675 --> 00:52:55.097]  And so he called it a provocation.
[00:52:55.157 --> 00:52:56.038]  That is a big deal!
[00:52:58.567 --> 00:53:03.988]  Meanwhile, Biden includes $8.8 billion in the $33 billion Ukraine package.
[00:53:04.208 --> 00:53:07.249]  Most of it goes back to the big guy himself, or large parts of it.
[00:53:07.889 --> 00:53:14.370]  Biden includes $8.8 billion, the $33 billion Ukraine package, on items like countering disinformation.
[00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:16.871]  That's what Obama signed in executive order before he left office.
[00:53:18.111 --> 00:53:21.712]  Countering Disinformation and Propaganda Act.
[00:53:21.752 --> 00:53:22.912]  And that put billions of U.S.
[00:53:22.972 --> 00:53:28.651]   money, even though Trump was about to be put into office, had been elected, was about to
[00:53:28.651 --> 00:53:35.852]   be sworn in, all those stay behind networks of bureaucrats and propagandists to continue
[00:53:35.852 --> 00:53:40.412]   to fight the American people and to fight populists and to keep the whole deep state
[00:53:40.412 --> 00:53:42.490]  system in charge.
[00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:48.092]   And so throughout Trump's four years, Obama was co-president basically, a few miles away
[00:53:48.092 --> 00:53:51.651]   from the White House, trying to thwart and block and manipulate everything that was going
[00:53:51.651 --> 00:53:52.651]  on.
[00:53:52.651 --> 00:53:58.492]   He was using the spy agencies he controlled with Clapper and Brennan and the rest of them
[00:53:58.492 --> 00:54:02.691]  to try to block Trump's agenda.
[00:54:02.665 --> 00:54:08.091]  And now they want 8.8 billion, much of which will be used in Ukraine with U.S.
[00:54:08.131 --> 00:54:12.055]  PSYOPs, not just attacking the Russians, but attacking the American people.
[00:54:13.197 --> 00:54:15.880]  Very, very serious situation.
[00:54:16.843 --> 00:54:22.788]  Mike Rowe says truckers aren't buying the Putin price hike spin as diesel hits all-time high.
[00:54:23.449 --> 00:54:29.134]  Baltimore native Mike Rowe became famous for Dirty Jobs Guy on the Discovery Channel.
[00:54:29.174 --> 00:54:35.540]  Now he's filming the second season of How America Works for Fox Business, showcasing the many individuals who work around the clock to keep the U.S.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:36.200]  economy humming.
[00:54:36.921 --> 00:54:39.623]  He wanted to say he's talked to thousands of truckers and others.
[00:54:40.124 --> 00:54:42.246]  None of them think it's Putin.
[00:54:44.133 --> 00:54:46.935]  Meanwhile, did Biden's Ministry of Truth ban all exports?
[00:54:48.115 --> 00:54:49.036]  What is going on here?
[00:54:49.676 --> 00:54:53.218]  It's a graph of U.S.
[00:54:53.318 --> 00:55:02.844]  exports going back to 1992 to now, and just look at that absolute free fall, almost down to zero.
[00:55:02.904 --> 00:55:04.125]  That is flatlining.
[00:55:05.525 --> 00:55:07.807]  That is death right there.
[00:55:08.612 --> 00:55:11.293]  Because we're dependent on foreign goods.
[00:55:11.674 --> 00:55:13.014]  So what happens if we lose the dollar?
[00:55:13.074 --> 00:55:14.976]  We have no economy here.
[00:55:18.217 --> 00:55:18.337]  U.S.
[00:55:18.357 --> 00:55:25.341]  trade deficit surged to a record high of $109.8 billion in March, topping $100 billion for the first time in history.
[00:55:25.741 --> 00:55:27.062]  You get those numbers a month late.
[00:55:29.664 --> 00:55:31.985]  So imagine what the new numbers are about to be when they come out.
[00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:40.512]  But don't worry, President Biden says every American taxpayer is directly contributing to the war.
[00:55:40.572 --> 00:55:45.114]  It's a quote in Ukraine, and it's something we should all be incredibly proud of.
[00:55:46.075 --> 00:55:48.816]  Yes, we should all be really incredibly proud of starting World War III.
[00:55:50.617 --> 00:55:53.658]  That's while he was giving a speech at a bomb-making factory.
[00:55:54.378 --> 00:55:57.920]  On the left loves bombs, they love censorship, they love torture.
[00:55:59.684 --> 00:56:01.925]  They'll have anything and everything you can imagine.
[00:56:02.565 --> 00:56:07.047]  Yeah, there's, for TV viewers, ships waiting to dock because of China's insane COVID strategy.
[00:56:07.067 --> 00:56:17.031]  It's not a strategy, it's economic warfare with the U.S., but they can't tell the Chinese businesses, hey, we're shutting down all the major coastal cities and all the production cities so that the U.S.
[00:56:17.051 --> 00:56:18.972]  has all its goods cut off in a trade war.
[00:56:19.032 --> 00:56:21.351]  They just go, "Oh, it's COVID, you're all locked down."
[00:56:21.351 --> 00:56:30.832]   Here's some really good maps that illustrate all this, both satirical and military.
[00:56:31.698 --> 00:56:39.304]  Got one here with Uncle Sam with his pocket full of NATO flags, placing them all over Eastern Europe on the Russian border, calling it expansion.
[00:56:40.686 --> 00:56:44.849]  And then here's the map that really, really matters right here.
[00:56:46.110 --> 00:56:51.975]  Not an inch of NATO's present military jurisdiction will spread in an eastern direction.
[00:56:52.536 --> 00:57:01.142]   Memorandum of Conversation between Mikhail Gorbachev and James Baker in Moscow on February 9th, 1990.
[00:57:01.562 --> 00:57:07.664]  And then George Herbert Walker Bush confirmed that in speeches and in policy statements.
[00:57:08.385 --> 00:57:10.765]  But now what have they done since 1990?
[00:57:11.246 --> 00:57:17.788]  In 1990, here is the map of NATO in red for TV viewers.
[00:57:21.138 --> 00:57:24.799]  Places like Turkey and Spain and France and Sweden.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:31.222]  But now it's expanded into more than a dozen other countries.
[00:57:33.303 --> 00:57:37.404]  And it's up against the Russian border and now taking over Ukraine.
[00:57:37.444 --> 00:57:39.805]  And you wonder why they're upset.
[00:57:39.825 --> 00:57:43.907]  Hacktivists and cybercriminals wreak havoc in Russia.
[00:57:43.947 --> 00:57:49.049]  Washington Post says, oh, we all heard the Russians were going to attack us, but instead they've been attacked by the hackers.
[00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.629]  Of course!
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:52.521]  It's The Globalist, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:52.541 --> 00:57:54.342]  I'm going to give the number out when we come back.
[00:57:54.362 --> 00:57:55.422]  We're going to take your phone calls.
[00:57:55.462 --> 00:57:56.042]  Please stay with us.
[00:57:56.343 --> 00:57:57.203]  Infowars.com.
[00:57:57.223 --> 00:57:58.023]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:57:58.043 --> 00:57:59.384]  All right, my friends.
[00:57:59.704 --> 00:58:01.505]  I want to hear from you on Roe v. Wade.
[00:58:03.386 --> 00:58:07.528]  I want to hear from you on the situation in Ukraine, the economy.
[00:58:08.449 --> 00:58:13.471]  I want to hear from you on all this poison vaccine news we're about to cover.
[00:58:13.571 --> 00:58:18.394]  I want to hear from you on any subject you want to raise, any subject you want to talk about.
[00:58:19.284 --> 00:58:23.365]  Long-time callers, first-time callers, callers that agree, callers that disagree.
[00:58:24.545 --> 00:58:26.585]  But we're only going to take calls a little bit in the next hour.
[00:58:26.645 --> 00:58:27.845]  Then Pete Santilli's joining us.
[00:58:27.885 --> 00:58:31.426]  So let's put eight callers on the board, and I'm going to take those eight callers, and that's it.
[00:58:31.926 --> 00:58:33.286]  That way other folks have to sit on hold.
[00:58:33.706 --> 00:58:36.387]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[00:58:36.407 --> 00:58:36.507]  877-789-2539.
[00:58:36.527 --> 00:58:36.807]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:58:36.827 --> 00:58:46.027]  877-892-539-8777-892539, 877-789-ALEX.
[00:58:46.027 --> 00:58:48.827]  We will take your call starting in the next segment.
[00:58:48.827 --> 00:58:52.027]  Okay, let's go ahead and hit this news.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:54.984]  We've got quite a bit of Bill Gates news, but I'm going to hit that at the end of this.
[00:58:56.306 --> 00:58:59.410]  Let's just hit this news right now, because there's a lot of it.
[00:59:01.372 --> 00:59:05.738]  CDC reinstates recommendation for mask on planes and trains.
[00:59:07.298 --> 00:59:14.620]  Now the same group claimed they had the power to make people wear masks and they have the CDC said courts shouldn't be able to overrule them last week.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:16.220]  So did Fauci.
[00:59:16.260 --> 00:59:19.521]  So they're saying they're above the law like the private Federal Reserve.
[00:59:19.841 --> 00:59:23.382]  And the CDC does own the patents on most of these deadly shots.
[00:59:23.782 --> 00:59:28.983]  So they actually have private members that are members that make money off making you take a product.
[00:59:29.603 --> 00:59:32.844]  Now the UN is officially invested in Pfizer and Moderna as well.
[00:59:33.344 --> 00:59:33.944]  Unprecedented.
[00:59:36.121 --> 00:59:40.888]  Beyond revolving doors, beyond corruption, it's just institutionalized corruption in your face.
[00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:43.172]  And so will this happen?
[00:59:43.212 --> 00:59:43.613]  We don't know.
[00:59:43.633 --> 00:59:48.901]  Will the airlines bow after everybody cheered and they're reporting less than 10% of folks are still wearing masks at the airports?
[00:59:49.744 --> 00:59:51.385]  I've talked to friends and family that have flown recently.
[00:59:51.405 --> 00:59:52.486]  They say nobody's wearing masks.
[00:59:53.046 --> 00:59:54.227]  Will they force them back on them?
[00:59:54.287 --> 00:59:55.427]  Well, they're trying to.
[00:59:55.988 --> 00:59:58.269]  They'll be liability for airlines if people get sick.
[00:59:58.589 --> 01:00:05.133]  This is lawyers making normal human life illegal and pretending like a shot or tyranny will protect you when they know it won't.
[01:00:05.633 --> 01:00:08.595]  It gives them the pretext to simply take control of society.
[01:00:08.975 --> 01:00:11.677]  And Fauci's been seen at parties, again, not wearing his mask.
[01:00:12.057 --> 01:00:14.919]  But he says you should always wear a mask because he thinks you're stupid.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.220]  Remember what happened last year?
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:25.503]  CDC issued eviction moratorium order that lasted almost a year and a judge had to override it saying people are going bankrupt.
[01:00:25.803 --> 01:00:28.764]  You can't let folks live in someone else's house or apartment for free.
[01:00:29.204 --> 01:00:32.305]  So again, illegal power grabs par excellence.
[01:00:32.845 --> 01:00:35.426]  Here is the eviction moratorium and impact on housing market.
[01:00:36.626 --> 01:00:39.367]  Supreme Court blocks Biden administration's eviction moratorium.
[01:00:40.953 --> 01:00:42.513]  That's how close we are to pure communism.
[01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:47.254]  CDC tracked millions of phones to see if Americans followed COVID lockdown orders.
[01:00:47.294 --> 01:00:48.514]  Well, that was a UN program.
[01:00:48.894 --> 01:00:49.815]  It happened worldwide.
[01:00:50.515 --> 01:00:53.015]  It's the rollout of the surveillance state they already have in place.
[01:00:54.975 --> 01:00:55.856]  Now here's the big one.
[01:00:57.056 --> 01:01:06.597]  German study numbered of those suffering severe complications that were taking COVID vaccine is 40 times higher than previously recorded.
[01:01:06.617 --> 01:01:12.449]   40 times higher And previously reported.
[01:01:12.489 --> 01:01:21.852]  A new German study with around 40,000 participants concluded that severe complications of receiving COVID vaccine were much higher than previously known.
[01:01:24.052 --> 01:01:25.032]  Because they were suppressing it.
[01:01:25.953 --> 01:01:36.375]  The number of severe complications after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is 40 times higher than previously recorded by the Pearl Ehrlich Institute, the most respected.
[01:01:36.915 --> 01:01:43.165]   A study with around 40,000 participants by the Bern Concludes and then you find the whole study right there.
[01:01:44.705 --> 01:01:50.107]  Death, blood clots, heart attacks, everything we already knew, but massive off the scale.
[01:01:52.328 --> 01:01:56.290]  And funny that 40 times number keeps popping up.
[01:01:56.750 --> 01:02:06.535]   We have 40% increase in deaths In those 18 to 63 working age in Europe, in the UK, in the US and Canada.
[01:02:06.555 --> 01:02:07.676]  It's between 38 and 42.
[01:02:08.196 --> 01:02:08.936]  The average is 40.
[01:02:10.577 --> 01:02:11.017]  40% increase.
[01:02:11.697 --> 01:02:14.478]  This is a 40 time increase.
[01:02:15.058 --> 01:02:17.419]  Ultra, ultra massive.
[01:02:17.439 --> 01:02:18.940]  It's a big story on Infowars.com.
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:22.941]  COVID vaccine complications 40 times higher than reported.
[01:02:24.082 --> 01:02:24.682]  German study.
[01:02:26.038 --> 01:02:29.320]  That is such a big, big deal.
[01:02:29.881 --> 01:02:31.802]  Meanwhile, we've got this really powerful report.
[01:02:31.822 --> 01:02:33.103]  We'll play it at the start of the next segment.
[01:02:33.603 --> 01:02:37.386]  Proof Conspiracy Theorists Were Right All Along, by Darren McBreen.
[01:02:37.426 --> 01:02:40.148]  Compilation up on Mandaw Video, dealing with the deadly shots.
[01:02:40.668 --> 01:02:41.609]  This is a lifesaver.
[01:02:41.629 --> 01:02:42.769]  Please share with everybody you know.
[01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:45.011]  Got some other really informative memes.
[01:02:45.371 --> 01:02:48.493]  This one says, Hit Me Up If You Catch My Drift.
[01:02:49.134 --> 01:02:50.455]  And it shows a bunch of stick figures.
[01:02:51.638 --> 01:02:53.179]  I'm simulcasting the radio, folks.
[01:02:53.199 --> 01:02:53.879]  That's why I'm narrating.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:59.802]  You got like one, two, three, four, five, six stick figures, and there's six pieces of fruit.
[01:03:00.262 --> 01:03:01.483]  And they say, yummy fruit.
[01:03:01.583 --> 01:03:02.843]  One of them falls over and dies.
[01:03:04.124 --> 01:03:07.446]  The other says, correlation does not equal causation.
[01:03:07.846 --> 01:03:09.447]  So they all eat the fruit, and they all die.
[01:03:10.627 --> 01:03:11.848]  And that's what we're witnessing here.
[01:03:12.976 --> 01:03:17.420]  If I saw somebody run somebody over with a truck and kill him, I'd say, hey, that guy just killed somebody with a truck.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:20.822]  The police, do the cops say, you're not a pathologist?
[01:03:21.503 --> 01:03:23.524]  How do you know that person, the truck killed him?
[01:03:25.306 --> 01:03:27.427]  Like I watched somebody get their head cut off with a guillotine.
[01:03:27.847 --> 01:03:29.909]  And I say, hey, they just cut his head off.
[01:03:30.089 --> 01:03:30.870]  You don't know that.
[01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:32.271]  You're not a pathologist.
[01:03:34.613 --> 01:03:36.034]  But I can read what the pathologists say.
[01:03:36.474 --> 01:03:39.096]  Study, cell phone radiation causes rise in dementia.
[01:03:39.757 --> 01:03:41.218]  Big report on InfoWars.com.
[01:03:42.281 --> 01:03:45.322]  Just unbelievable information.
[01:03:45.342 --> 01:03:46.883]  This is not a joke, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:47.503 --> 01:03:52.746]  This is China, where they make you pull up at the COVID testing and stick a swab in your ear.
[01:03:52.846 --> 01:03:54.746]  And this is what they want to bring here.
[01:03:54.786 --> 01:03:55.787]  It's all about dominance.
[01:03:55.807 --> 01:03:56.887]  It's all about slave training.
[01:03:57.308 --> 01:03:58.288]  It's all about control.
[01:03:59.188 --> 01:04:00.349]  Here they are in Thailand.
[01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:02.970]  This is the TSA there.
[01:04:05.131 --> 01:04:07.092]  I mean, there's no end to it.
[01:04:07.932 --> 01:04:11.734]  If you ask what level of humiliation you're going to live under, it's a level you'll put up with.
[01:04:13.089 --> 01:04:14.530]  A new video's coming up next segment.
[01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:15.530]  Hell, we'll go to it right now.
[01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:23.334]  Bill Gates claims it's quite clear coronavirus originated in bats, dismisses lab leaks, it's not a theory, and blames climate change.
[01:04:23.634 --> 01:04:36.380]  So they gear this up in a lab, we have all the documents, they build it, they prepare it, it's called COVID-19, they release it, and now he tells us the guy that's behind it all on TV with Trevor Noah that everything's fine, here he is.
[01:04:37.944 --> 01:04:42.765]  How do we prevent something where we don't even understand how it came to be?
[01:04:42.805 --> 01:04:46.766]  Are there labs where they need to do better at enclosing the work that they're doing?
[01:04:46.786 --> 01:04:51.247]  I understand that they have to do the work, but how do we figure that out and how do we move forward in that realm?
[01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:54.548]  Well, we should be careful about lab safety.
[01:04:55.228 --> 01:04:58.929]  It's quite clear in this case that it came across through animals.
[01:04:59.349 --> 01:05:05.831]  Almost all our diseases, like HIV, crossed over from chimpanzees in Africa quite some time ago.
[01:05:05.891 --> 01:05:07.211]  It only came from bats.
[01:05:08.251 --> 01:05:13.273]  This also, with one step in between, came from bats.
[01:05:13.313 --> 01:05:20.236]  So it's going to keep happening, particularly with climate change, where we're invading a lot of habitats.
[01:05:21.516 --> 01:05:23.037]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:05:23.137 --> 01:05:23.977]  You're bad.
[01:05:24.377 --> 01:05:29.219]  It's going to come out of the jungles, not out of the biolabs he runs, even though we have documented they made the virus.
[01:05:29.279 --> 01:05:29.939]  It's man-made.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.000]  It's on record.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.381]  The vaccine is the same thing, but even worse.
[01:05:34.483 --> 01:05:37.525]  Here's the guy behind it all, on record, that says he wants to kill you.
[01:05:37.786 --> 01:05:45.471]  His dad, the former head of Planned Parenthood, says there's too many people, and here he is, the guy behind it all, and Trevor Noah's asking, how do we protect ourselves?
[01:05:45.511 --> 01:05:46.272]  How do we stop this?
[01:05:46.292 --> 01:05:47.873]  He goes, oh, it's gonna happen again, sorry.
[01:05:48.914 --> 01:05:58.801]  You're literally looking at the killer, the psychopath who runs all the medical systems worldwide, except 20-something countries he got kicked out of, sitting there, looking at you like he's the expert.
[01:05:59.081 --> 01:06:01.543]  What do we do to stop this problem?
[01:06:04.321 --> 01:06:05.261]  And then he's the problem.
[01:06:06.222 --> 01:06:06.862]  We know what we do.
[01:06:06.882 --> 01:06:07.982]  We arrest Bill Gates.
[01:06:08.002 --> 01:06:08.842]  We bring all this info out.
[01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:09.703]  We arrest Peter Daszak.
[01:06:10.003 --> 01:06:10.923]  We arrest Fauci.
[01:06:11.723 --> 01:06:13.504]  We arrest Obama, who was heavily involved in it.
[01:06:13.564 --> 01:06:13.984]  That's it.
[01:06:14.544 --> 01:06:17.005]  But instead, Gates says, oh, a new virus is coming.
[01:06:18.905 --> 01:06:19.965]  A new one's coming.
[01:06:19.985 --> 01:06:21.226]  You're all going to be dead.
[01:06:21.246 --> 01:06:24.847]  Oh, and my vaccine doesn't work, but I sure got rich off of it.
[01:06:25.467 --> 01:06:27.708]  He gets your money while he diseases you and kills you.
[01:06:28.048 --> 01:06:28.808]  We'll be back with your call.
[01:06:28.828 --> 01:06:29.208]  Stay with us.
[01:06:31.568 --> 01:06:37.813]  If you had asked me all this stuff a year ago about the corruption that's going on, I would have said you're crazy.
[01:06:37.873 --> 01:06:41.937]  There's no way that there could be this level of corruption in government.
[01:06:41.997 --> 01:06:47.761]  You shouldn't listen to InfoWars and Band.Video because that's all nonsense.
[01:06:47.862 --> 01:06:50.304]  And, you know, you shouldn't pay attention to any of this stuff.
[01:06:53.546 --> 01:07:03.533]  It's been very evident to me that all of these people who are being labeled as misinformation spreaders, I mean, they're the guys telling the truth.
[01:07:03.993 --> 01:07:11.779]  There are many thousands of physicians who have been silenced from telling the American people the good news about the situation, that we can manage the virus.
[01:07:12.259 --> 01:07:15.921]  The true misinformation spreaders are the CDC and the public health officials.
[01:07:16.161 --> 01:07:19.443]  This remains a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:07:19.563 --> 01:07:22.184]  They are the ones that are propagating this outbreak.
[01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.385]  The only people you can blame, this isn't shaming, this is the truth.
[01:07:24.806 --> 01:07:27.247]  Maybe they should be shamed, by the unvaccinated.
[01:07:27.767 --> 01:07:32.210]  This is a situation of an outbreak and a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:07:32.110 --> 01:07:36.110]   Dr. Fauci's probably done more good for the world than all of us in this room combined.
[01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:37.110]  I mean...
[01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:41.110]  [applause]
[01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:47.680]   Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:52.110]   claimed that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?
[01:07:51.998 --> 01:07:53.599]  I totally resent that!
[01:07:53.699 --> 01:07:57.321]  And if anybody is lying here, Senator, it is you!
[01:07:57.501 --> 01:08:10.287]  We now know that Fauci-funded EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based non-profit headed by Peter Daszak, was absolutely engaged in gain-of-function research to make chimeric SARS-based coronaviruses, which they confirmed could infect human cells.
[01:08:10.407 --> 01:08:11.148]  And the worst part?
[01:08:11.628 --> 01:08:16.052]  All the people going along and being lab rats for these heartless megacorporations.
[01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:17.833]  It is truly incredible.
[01:08:18.173 --> 01:08:23.578]  If only people had the entire story that the COVID shots are not conventional vaccines.
[01:08:23.978 --> 01:08:29.782]  There are plenty of examples of people that are having very serious medical conditions that result from the vaccination.
[01:08:29.943 --> 01:08:34.166]  When the convulsion started, I knew it had to be from the vaccine.
[01:08:34.406 --> 01:08:39.389]  Due to this vaccine, I don't even know if I'll gain full movement in my leg back.
[01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:42.070]  One of their high school football players died.
[01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:46.012]  He had two blood clots inside his brain, another on the outside of his brain.
[01:08:46.133 --> 01:08:48.494]  The hardest thing was I let him get that shot.
[01:08:50.415 --> 01:08:51.936]  I got the vaccine!
[01:08:51.855 --> 01:08:53.855]  I got the vaccine!
[01:08:53.855 --> 01:08:55.855]  [Crying]
[01:08:55.855 --> 01:08:57.855]  [Crying]
[01:08:57.855 --> 01:08:59.855]  Please help!
[01:08:59.855 --> 01:09:01.855]  We need help!
[01:09:01.855 --> 01:09:11.855]  [Music]
[01:09:11.855 --> 01:09:13.855]  [Gunshot]
[01:09:13.855 --> 01:09:15.855]  That's a very important report.
[01:09:15.474 --> 01:09:17.156]  It's on Band.Video.
[01:09:18.276 --> 01:09:20.398]  Proof conspiracy theorists were right all along.
[01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:22.720]  Please get it out to everybody you know.
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.962]  It's at Band.Video in the Derrick McBrain section.
[01:09:24.982 --> 01:09:25.562]  You can't miss it.
[01:09:27.404 --> 01:09:29.865]  Okay, back to the Alex Jones Show here and your phone calls.
[01:09:30.886 --> 01:09:35.810]  We got Trucker Rich, we got Sam, we got Matt, we got Brian, we got Sky, we got Jason, we got Brenda, and we got Jeff.
[01:09:35.830 --> 01:09:37.031]  We're going to get to every single one of you.
[01:09:37.571 --> 01:09:39.473]  The order of your calls are received.
[01:09:40.174 --> 01:09:42.175]  Let's talk to Trucker Rich in Idaho.
[01:09:42.195 --> 01:09:42.776]  You're on the air.
[01:09:42.836 --> 01:09:43.116]  Welcome.
[01:09:44.261 --> 01:09:46.442]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:48.684]  It is an absolute honor to talk to you.
[01:09:49.224 --> 01:09:51.345]  And I thank you for what you do.
[01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:55.187]  And, you know, people across the country are waking up.
[01:09:55.268 --> 01:09:56.288]  I talk to people over.
[01:09:56.548 --> 01:09:57.429]  They're waking up.
[01:09:58.569 --> 01:10:05.954]  And what we all need to do is talk to these people, not in condemnation, but talk to them in love.
[01:10:06.794 --> 01:10:07.755]  And then give them facts.
[01:10:08.268 --> 01:10:14.352]  I've got 17 pages, um, 17 tabs on my phone that I go to when people ask me questions.
[01:10:15.793 --> 01:10:21.097]  So we can't condemn them because the people that don't want to wake up, they will condemn themselves.
[01:10:21.758 --> 01:10:27.962]  And I just want to tell every listener out there, all right, I bought three of your cards.
[01:10:28.082 --> 01:10:31.284]  I'm giving them away as gifts and I donated $300 to you.
[01:10:31.304 --> 01:10:31.985]  Thank you.
[01:10:32.305 --> 01:10:34.086]  I'm not, I'm okay.
[01:10:34.126 --> 01:10:35.387]  Well, you're, you're welcome.
[01:10:35.487 --> 01:10:36.088]  It's my honor.
[01:10:36.952 --> 01:10:46.632]  Everybody that's listening, if y'all just give $1 to help the cause, that would help Alex out so very much for what he's going through.
[01:10:46.652 --> 01:10:48.376]  He is sacrificing for us.
[01:10:49.918 --> 01:10:52.080]  Well, listen, I appreciate you saying that, and I want to be clear.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.902]  We're not just some regular conservative talk show.
[01:10:54.922 --> 01:11:04.468]  We're the tip of the spear, hated by the enemy, that's figured out they're playing together with our guests, our listeners, this whole family, and the work we are doing is the most important it's ever been.
[01:11:04.508 --> 01:11:08.451]  We have really hit our stride where we're at, and we're having an ultra-massive effect.
[01:11:08.471 --> 01:11:10.813]  So thank you for your support, and that's a great idea.
[01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:13.555]  You know, we're going to run out of these in about a month or so at current sales rate.
[01:11:13.595 --> 01:11:16.216]  It's an original piece of art, Alex Jones.
[01:11:17.210 --> 01:11:25.217]  Exclusive InfoWars Republic Defense with a little limited edition gold bar, the original Alex Jones art of the sheepdog chasing the wolf.
[01:11:25.677 --> 01:11:29.580]  On the back it's got the hologram with a wolf chasing the sheep.
[01:11:30.221 --> 01:11:33.904]  1776, all about becoming a sheepdog, not a sheep, but not a wolf.
[01:11:33.984 --> 01:11:36.626]  And they're available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:11:36.646 --> 01:11:37.607]  So thank you for the plug.
[01:11:37.667 --> 01:11:42.932]  Exclusive InfoWars limited edition, proprietary, 24 karat, 999 pure gold collectible.
[01:11:44.153 --> 01:11:44.293]  Yep.
[01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:52.337]  I thank you, and everybody that works for you that lives in Austin, thank you for what you guys are doing.
[01:11:52.537 --> 01:11:53.317]  Keep up the fight.
[01:11:54.258 --> 01:11:54.998]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:11:55.038 --> 01:11:55.578]  God bless you.
[01:11:56.118 --> 01:11:57.519]  All right, let's go to more callers.
[01:11:57.619 --> 01:11:58.979]  Sam in North Dakota.
[01:11:59.019 --> 01:12:02.301]  Sam, thanks for calling in on the air.
[01:12:02.561 --> 01:12:03.321]  Good morning.
[01:12:03.821 --> 01:12:10.303]  I'm calling to just want to say first thing, first and foremost, I love America.
[01:12:11.024 --> 01:12:14.905]  I don't want to see America on a life support system like it is right now.
[01:12:16.653 --> 01:12:28.964]  As far as the food situation and shortages and so forth, I'm right up here in the heartland and right now we are currently two weeks behind in our planting.
[01:12:30.105 --> 01:12:32.728]  People can't get fertilizer, we can't get feed.
[01:12:33.368 --> 01:12:42.496]  Now the fuel is doubled in price for these farmers and we are going to have a real catastrophe by the end of this growing season.
[01:12:43.962 --> 01:12:49.735]  These guys are just going to get out in the fields to get their product planted and harvested in a timely fashion.
[01:12:52.005 --> 01:12:53.105]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:12:53.686 --> 01:12:55.647]  And for those that don't know, it's not just your opinion.
[01:12:56.547 --> 01:12:59.188]  Fertilizer, about half the world's fertilizer is cut off.
[01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:03.250]  That means in the next year, just disastrous level starvation.
[01:13:03.730 --> 01:13:11.534]  And again, if you think we've got third world populations, we can show them the B-roll of just hundreds of Haitians an hour pouring across the Texas border.
[01:13:12.114 --> 01:13:16.316]  If people think that's bad, the millions a month coming across, this is just the beginning.
[01:13:18.136 --> 01:13:19.177]  It's horrible.
[01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:40.030]  I don't know what to tell people except it's time that we go and meet our neighbors, extend our hand out of love and care, because we're going to need each other, and the only way that these globalists scum is going to win is if they get us divided.
[01:13:42.415 --> 01:13:43.256]  Absolutely, sir.
[01:13:43.316 --> 01:13:44.337]  You're absolutely right.
[01:13:44.437 --> 01:13:51.002]  And so again, you're saying you're involved in farming and you're seeing people not planting because they don't have fertilizer.
[01:13:52.604 --> 01:13:57.908]  Well, not planting and also the fact that we had torrential rains.
[01:13:57.948 --> 01:14:02.392]  We've gotten half of our annual rainfall within a week's period of time.
[01:14:03.273 --> 01:14:05.735]  And we just ain't going to get out in the field.
[01:14:05.755 --> 01:14:09.158]  We're already two weeks behind the eight ball already in planting.
[01:14:09.628 --> 01:14:16.552]  And that's going to be another two weeks before people can even get in the field to plant their corn and their soybeans and their wheat crops up here.
[01:14:19.674 --> 01:14:20.415]  Unbelievable, sir.
[01:14:20.475 --> 01:14:21.035]  God bless you.
[01:14:22.316 --> 01:14:30.521]  I mean, we keep explaining this, but even young people on average, I'm not singling them out, but it's true, each generation gets more separated from the land, more separated from reality.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:39.327]  They've got statistics and numbers out where half of young people don't even know where meat comes from, or where electricity comes from, or the most common sense things.
[01:14:40.207 --> 01:14:45.832]  They've done studies where 90 plus percent of college students can't name one of the amendments to the Bill of Rights.
[01:14:46.573 --> 01:14:49.015]  They have no idea where anything comes from.
[01:14:49.035 --> 01:14:50.637]  They think, oh, electricity's clean.
[01:14:50.977 --> 01:14:52.799]  They don't know it comes from the same power source.
[01:14:53.379 --> 01:14:54.240]  For electric cars.
[01:14:54.260 --> 01:15:04.288]  They just don't have any idea what it means to cut off our pipelines, and cut off our oil and gas, and to cut off the third world's food, and not even let them produce food.
[01:15:04.308 --> 01:15:06.891]  Because we thought we had lockdowns bad here, folks.
[01:15:07.171 --> 01:15:12.916]  The IMF and World Bank were ordering lockdowns up until two months ago in Latin American countries and Africa.
[01:15:13.917 --> 01:15:18.781]  And the people that come here, nine out of ten say, I'm coming here because I'm starving to death, they won't let us work.
[01:15:21.357 --> 01:15:24.418]  But I'm not against these poor people flooding here trying to survive.
[01:15:25.198 --> 01:15:29.560]  What I'm explaining is, is that it is a weapon system, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:39.543]  And they are going to be brainwashed, they're going to be made dependent, they're going to be put on welfare, and they're going to be groups that the Democrats and the deep state have as a permanent underclass.
[01:15:39.583 --> 01:15:40.323]  It is so dangerous.
[01:15:40.943 --> 01:15:41.804]  All right, we come back.
[01:15:42.524 --> 01:15:50.117]   Get ready and start your engines for Matt And then Jason and Brian and Sky and Brenda and Jeff taking your calls.
[01:15:50.157 --> 01:15:51.577]  The order they are received.
[01:15:51.597 --> 01:15:53.878]  Want to thank that caller for his support.
[01:15:53.898 --> 01:15:55.359]  Getting three of the little gold cards.
[01:15:55.459 --> 01:15:56.679]  Original art with gold.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:58.760]  Thank you for buying your war bonds.
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:15:59.521]  I salute you.
[01:15:59.901 --> 01:16:01.361]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:01.882 --> 01:16:02.022]  X2.
[01:16:02.062 --> 01:16:03.742]  We only got a limited supply.
[01:16:03.822 --> 01:16:05.443]  It's selling out despite that.
[01:16:06.083 --> 01:16:07.044]  It's 25% off.
[01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:08.624]  Experience deeper crystalline for yourself.
[01:16:09.004 --> 01:16:10.205]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:10.585 --> 01:16:11.245]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:11.265 --> 01:16:11.706]  Stay with us.
[01:16:12.306 --> 01:16:19.537]   Well, the chickens are coming home to roost, but Whenever Democrats get sued for defamation, the cases always get thrown out.
[01:16:19.557 --> 01:16:24.981]  And then when it's a Republican gets sued, they rig it all in court so that they're, quote, convicted.
[01:16:25.021 --> 01:16:26.262]  That's how they go up to the First Amendment.
[01:16:27.043 --> 01:16:31.446]  Repairman who revealed Hunter Biden's laptop sues chef CNN Politico on the Daily Beast.
[01:16:32.347 --> 01:16:33.447]  They said it was a Russian agent.
[01:16:33.487 --> 01:16:34.328]  They said he fabricated it.
[01:16:34.348 --> 01:16:35.209]  They said he was a liar.
[01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:38.711]  Biden wouldn't come pick the damn thing up.
[01:16:39.712 --> 01:16:43.935]  He looked at it, looked on it and saw the child porn and said, well, I got a responsibility to call the police on this.
[01:16:45.848 --> 01:16:47.630]  That's their jobs at those computer repair places.
[01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:50.813]  You see something illegal, you don't report it, well, you're part of it, aren't you?
[01:16:53.035 --> 01:16:55.397]  Hunter Biden having sex with his niece, all the rest of it.
[01:16:57.219 --> 01:16:57.779]  Incredible.
[01:16:57.799 --> 01:16:58.720]  These people are unbelievable.
[01:17:00.522 --> 01:17:03.664]  Calling me a Russian agent, calling Trump a Russian agent, it's disgusting.
[01:17:04.425 --> 01:17:04.966]  No evidence.
[01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:09.550]  And now we know, we already knew, it was all completely fabricated.
[01:17:10.529 --> 01:17:10.889]  Alex, how are you?
[01:17:10.909 --> 01:17:11.550]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.850]  It's an honor.
[01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:12.770]  Good to talk to you, brother.
[01:17:12.610 --> 01:17:17.249]   agent now because he says hey NATO we now learned started this war with Russia
[01:17:17.249 --> 01:17:23.289]   yeah I mean maybe not having World War three will get people to start thinking
[01:17:23.289 --> 01:17:27.449]   a little bit clearer I don't know let's go ahead and take a call from Boston
[01:17:27.449 --> 01:17:33.010]   let's talk to Matt in Boston Matt welcome Alex how are you pleasure to

[01:17:49.215 --> 01:17:49.274]  vitamin mineral fusion.
[01:17:49.274 --> 01:17:54.914]   Winter Sun, Survival Shield, long time user of those. Great product, great product.
[01:17:54.914 --> 01:17:59.474]   Thank you. I just wanted to bring up one thing and I'll let you run with this. I
[01:17:59.474 --> 01:18:03.414]   know Tucker and yourself have talked about this a little bit but no one is
[01:18:03.414 --> 01:18:09.194]   touching on the attack on the food industrial food supply facilities. There's
[01:18:09.136 --> 01:18:11.936]  It's just unbelievable how this is just being overlooked.
[01:18:11.936 --> 01:18:18.615]  I can't, I just, I can't fathom what's going on here.
[01:18:18.615 --> 01:18:25.695]   Well sir, since we covered that a few weeks ago, more plants have burned down each day.
[01:18:25.695 --> 01:18:31.956]   So by the law of statistics that's been looked into by statisticians, this is thousands of
[01:18:31.956 --> 01:18:37.416]   times the number of plants that burn a year already and we're not even halfway through
[01:18:37.416 --> 01:18:39.815]  the year.
[01:18:39.472 --> 01:18:40.253]  So, yeah.
[01:18:41.254 --> 01:18:44.036]  It's crazy, and this is war.
[01:18:44.496 --> 01:18:47.598]  And China has cut off basically all shipments to the U.S.
[01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:57.926]  When I tell you the supply chain's broke down, we call around to all the big companies that make quality supplements and other products, and they're all like, yeah, we're 20, 30 weeks behind.
[01:18:57.946 --> 01:18:59.907]  We don't even know what we can do.
[01:19:00.087 --> 01:19:01.929]  It's, again, the globalists set us up.
[01:19:01.949 --> 01:19:03.090]  We were totally dependent on China.
[01:19:04.622 --> 01:19:05.042]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:19:05.062 --> 01:19:05.382]  I totally agree.
[01:19:05.402 --> 01:19:09.903]  Thank you for taking my call and I appreciate it and God bless you, man.
[01:19:09.923 --> 01:19:11.044]  God bless you, man.
[01:19:11.064 --> 01:19:11.784]  We're in this together.
[01:19:11.824 --> 01:19:12.044]  Thank you.
[01:19:11.864 --> 01:19:16.264]   our borders, devaluing our currency, we are being destroyed right now.
[01:19:16.264 --> 01:19:21.303]   And it's so emblematic that a senile crazy person is the figurehead of it.
[01:19:21.303 --> 01:19:22.303]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:19:22.303 --> 01:19:23.303]  I totally agree.
[01:19:23.303 --> 01:19:27.184]   Thank you for taking my call and I appreciate it and God bless you, man.
[01:19:27.184 --> 01:19:28.184]  God bless you, man.
[01:19:28.184 --> 01:19:29.184]  We're in this together.
[01:19:29.184 --> 01:19:30.184]  Thank you.
[01:19:30.184 --> 01:19:31.184]  You are the Infowar, sir.
[01:19:31.184 --> 01:19:33.543]  So don't thank me, thank yourself for taking action.
[01:19:33.557 --> 01:19:34.318]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:19:34.358 --> 01:19:38.601]  You are the heart of what we're doing, the blood of the thing, and the mind and the guts of the whole operation.
[01:19:39.622 --> 01:19:42.464]  All right, up next here would be Jason in Texas.
[01:19:42.484 --> 01:19:43.184]  Jason, welcome.
[01:19:44.905 --> 01:19:45.546]  What's up, Alex?
[01:19:45.586 --> 01:19:45.926]  Love you.
[01:19:47.267 --> 01:19:48.208]  Thanks for everything you do, man.
[01:19:48.608 --> 01:19:49.309]  Yes, sir.
[01:19:50.389 --> 01:19:57.975]  One disagreement with what's going on here, and I was at the Cappy with the L16, so let's get that out there.
[01:19:59.055 --> 01:20:01.077]  I think you're giving Trump a pass right now.
[01:20:01.676 --> 01:20:08.480]  And I think that you're still holding on to the idea that Trump was organic and that Trump is real.
[01:20:08.541 --> 01:20:16.226]  And I think that the system would never allow that because the system would never jeopardize what's at stake, the control of the power.
[01:20:16.246 --> 01:20:19.548]  They would never let someone organic come in and jeopardize that.
[01:20:20.108 --> 01:20:25.151]  And you keep holding on to this idea that they are, and you keep saying this thing that Obama's running things.
[01:20:25.912 --> 01:20:30.133]   Obama, again, There would never just be one guy running things.
[01:20:30.333 --> 01:20:33.996]  It's far worse than Obama is running things.
[01:20:34.696 --> 01:20:43.323]  And I get what you're saying there, but you're still directing people into the left-right paradigm, and you're still giving this system a chance when it doesn't have one.
[01:20:43.723 --> 01:20:46.326]  And another thing... Well, listen, listen, let's be fair about this.
[01:20:46.746 --> 01:20:48.627]  I'm the guy that coined the term left-right paradigm.
[01:20:48.647 --> 01:20:49.068]  Did you know that?
[01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.153]  Yeah, I know you're the man, Alex.
[01:20:52.333 --> 01:21:02.761]  Believe me, I'm not just trying to... No, no, no, I'm not trying to... But then under Trump, whether he's real or not, the populist movement and what happened there scared the hell out of the globalists.
[01:21:02.841 --> 01:21:04.322]  And Bolsonaro, I believe, is real.
[01:21:04.582 --> 01:21:05.823]  We know Boris Johnson wasn't.
[01:21:06.503 --> 01:21:09.846]  And so I know that Trump really believes what he says and does.
[01:21:09.886 --> 01:21:10.967]  He's got some blind spots.
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:21.531]  And so I'm not just, I'm very critical of Trump, but I'm explaining that the Trump movement and that galvanizing force has really scared the New World Order.
[01:21:23.083 --> 01:21:24.024]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:21:24.044 --> 01:21:26.585]  So I'm not giving Trump a pass any level.
[01:21:26.625 --> 01:21:28.367]  And I can tell you, I'm organic.
[01:21:28.887 --> 01:21:29.928]  The people are organic.
[01:21:30.048 --> 01:21:30.908]  I know I'm real.
[01:21:31.008 --> 01:21:33.610]  I know I'm not getting any secret help from the New World Order.
[01:21:34.351 --> 01:21:37.153]  I'm getting all my help from the American people and people that care about freedom.
[01:21:38.093 --> 01:21:40.555]  And so I know that we have power.
[01:21:40.675 --> 01:21:41.396]  The people have power.
[01:21:41.416 --> 01:21:42.877]  It's not just folks in the establishment.
[01:21:43.137 --> 01:21:44.177]  That's why they fear us, brother.
[01:21:45.438 --> 01:21:45.939]  I believe that.
[01:21:46.139 --> 01:21:47.180]  I believe you're real, sir.
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.020]  100 percent.
[01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:50.622]  I met you at the first COVID protest in Austin.
[01:21:51.044 --> 01:21:55.545]  As you were walking up, I was the guy that just said thank you very much for everything.
[01:21:55.605 --> 01:22:00.047]  Another point I want to make too, but just back to the Trump thing, is that he abandoned us.
[01:22:00.467 --> 01:22:02.348]  He abandoned the 1-6 Patriots.
[01:22:02.648 --> 01:22:03.968]  He abandoned Assange.
[01:22:04.268 --> 01:22:11.250]  He was not honest about the real problems in this country that we're facing, the New World Order, and the situation that's going on.
[01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:20.278]   And also, he did a very poor job, which I believe now was on purpose, in Unifying people and clarifying himself.
[01:22:20.798 --> 01:22:27.783]  And I know that the media was there just beating him to death, but that just seemed... Okay, Jason, here's where I stand on this.
[01:22:28.303 --> 01:22:31.605]  And I've thought about doing a few shows where you open the phones up and say, what's your view of Trump?
[01:22:31.625 --> 01:22:33.526]  We can say good things, say bad things.
[01:22:33.546 --> 01:22:34.347]  It's a complex issue.
[01:22:34.387 --> 01:22:36.848]  But Trump is not in power anymore.
[01:22:36.929 --> 01:22:38.389]  They stole the election from him.
[01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:40.431]  He's got thousands of lawsuits.
[01:22:40.471 --> 01:22:41.511]  They're trying to put him in jail.
[01:22:41.692 --> 01:22:43.533]  I really don't think he's a globalist operative.
[01:22:44.473 --> 01:22:46.773]  I mean, I don't think they're all powerful.
[01:22:46.793 --> 01:22:48.014]  I'm not saying he's perfect either.
[01:22:48.774 --> 01:22:50.234]  I've said all the things you're saying.
[01:22:50.994 --> 01:22:51.274]  Okay?
[01:22:51.294 --> 01:22:53.055]  The Assange thing is terrible.
[01:22:53.975 --> 01:22:56.135]  Not standing up for more than January 6th people is terrible.
[01:22:56.655 --> 01:22:57.895]  I totally agree with you on that.
[01:22:57.995 --> 01:23:01.176]  But what does it do to sit here and talk about him?
[01:23:01.216 --> 01:23:02.316]  I mean, let me ask you this.
[01:23:02.396 --> 01:23:04.677]  Why are you upset about Trump right now?
[01:23:05.177 --> 01:23:06.497]  Why are you trying to hammer him?
[01:23:06.517 --> 01:23:12.818]  Because I believe that's a key thing that the system is still holding onto their weapon.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:14.221]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:23:14.081 --> 01:23:18.360]  which is Trump, and I was at the Capitol, and I was there.
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:21.320]  I had gotten a fight, and I was ready to go.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:23.961]  I would have done it any day, and Trump had the chance.
[01:23:23.961 --> 01:23:26.161]  He had us there.
[01:23:26.161 --> 01:23:33.081]   He had 1776 in his hands, and he gave us the old site, and he turned his back, and he said,
[01:23:33.081 --> 01:23:34.081]  "Shut up!"
[01:23:34.081 --> 01:23:35.081]  And I gave him the space.
[01:23:35.081 --> 01:23:36.201]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:23:36.201 --> 01:23:40.081]  I disagree with you.
[01:23:40.081 --> 01:23:44.119]   If we would have actually taken that Capitol over and held it hostage, we would have become
[01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:47.921]   what they are, and they'd have sent the military in, and they'd have permanent martial law
[01:23:47.921 --> 01:23:48.560]  right now.
[01:23:49.448 --> 01:23:52.929]  We had lots of Trump rallies to show our support for Trump, and we didn't buy the election.
[01:23:53.329 --> 01:23:55.909]  We wanted a 10-day investigation by the Senate that's legal and lawful.
[01:23:56.989 --> 01:24:04.091]  And so I get why you're pissed at Trump now, in that you wanted to have the big takeover and beat the New World Order there that day.
[01:24:04.551 --> 01:24:05.891]  I don't think that's good strategy.
[01:24:06.311 --> 01:24:08.532]  But we can agree to disagree.
[01:24:09.152 --> 01:24:09.592]  It's okay.
[01:24:11.141 --> 01:24:12.181]  I understand you're pissed off.
[01:24:12.202 --> 01:24:13.242]  I understand you have passion.
[01:24:13.302 --> 01:24:14.383]  I respect that passion.
[01:24:16.644 --> 01:24:18.204]  Let's go to Sky in Washington.
[01:24:18.224 --> 01:24:18.865]  Sky, welcome.
[01:24:18.885 --> 01:24:19.405]  You're on the air.
[01:24:21.226 --> 01:24:21.846]  Hello, sir.
[01:24:21.906 --> 01:24:22.386]  Thank you.
[01:24:23.327 --> 01:24:30.090]  I just want to say I really respect and I want to echo everything all your previous callers said today except that last caller.
[01:24:30.750 --> 01:24:34.512]  But it's okay to have disagreements and I respect that he has a different point of view.
[01:24:34.572 --> 01:24:36.973]  I think you answered his questions really well.
[01:24:38.265 --> 01:24:39.906]  And you're doing a great show today, Alex.
[01:24:39.986 --> 01:24:42.687]  Thanks for staying on the air and keeping up the fight.
[01:24:43.087 --> 01:24:49.009]  Coming to you from Southwest Washington, Washington's third district, where we have Joe Kent running for Congress.
[01:24:49.049 --> 01:24:52.390]  So I wanted to talk about the midterms really quick and then ask you a question.
[01:24:53.570 --> 01:24:56.731]  Joe Kent is the gold star, has been running for Congress.
[01:24:56.791 --> 01:24:58.212]  He's the best candidate we have.
[01:24:58.552 --> 01:25:06.115]  All the other candidates, I see them siding with the Democrats and the globalists and defending Bill Gates and BlackRock.
[01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:16.356]  So I wanted to ask, because these are people who are going after the Patriot vote, do you have a call for unity among Patriots?
[01:25:18.476 --> 01:25:26.501]  Well, politics is an extremely complex situation and I couldn't even pretend to know about all these local races and things that are going on at that level.
[01:25:26.541 --> 01:25:30.164]  I used to study it and be mainly a kind of Republican analyst type guy.
[01:25:30.244 --> 01:25:31.224]  I can't keep track of all that.
[01:25:31.244 --> 01:25:44.413]  I'm mainly focused on war in Ukraine and devaluation of the dollar and the imploding border and the pedophiles running wild and the collapse of Hollywood and then the mass starvation triggering worldwide and the next virus they're going to release.
[01:25:44.493 --> 01:25:56.119]   So when you talk about unity of patriots, I mean, we need to get America first, Republicans elected, more like Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[01:25:56.879 --> 01:25:58.780]  And I mean, that's right.
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:25:59.540]  So, yeah, of course.
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:01.561]  When you say unity, what do you mean unity?
[01:26:04.262 --> 01:26:11.058]   Well, among the public, I understand candidates can have different points of view.
[01:26:11.098 --> 01:26:11.619]  That's fine.
[01:26:11.679 --> 01:26:18.127]  But among the public, we need to unify behind the strongest America First candidates, the ones that you're talking about, like Marjorie Taylor Greene.
[01:26:18.147 --> 01:26:18.327]  Hold on.
[01:26:18.347 --> 01:26:18.928]  Don't hang up.
[01:26:18.968 --> 01:26:19.608]  Don't hang up, Sky.
[01:26:19.628 --> 01:26:20.570]  I want to get your point here.
[01:26:21.190 --> 01:26:22.011]  I'm sure you got a great point.
[01:26:22.031 --> 01:26:22.852]  I'm just missing it.
[01:26:22.872 --> 01:26:23.053]  All right.
[01:26:23.073 --> 01:26:24.134]  Going right back to the call.
[01:26:24.534 --> 01:26:26.917]  Sky in Washington.
[01:26:29.093 --> 01:26:30.314]  I mean, obviously I want unity.
[01:26:30.374 --> 01:26:33.416]  Are you talking about unity to get American first people elected?
[01:26:33.436 --> 01:26:37.618]  Well, you got to study their voting record or what they did, if they were ever in office before.
[01:26:37.658 --> 01:26:39.539]  I mean, what specifically are you asking me?
[01:26:41.901 --> 01:26:42.361]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:43.321 --> 01:26:59.251]   Well, just not have infighting among the Patriot vote, just all the people who backed Trump I think Trump's going to run again, and I think he's counting on America First people being there in Congress.
[01:26:59.872 --> 01:27:07.940]  When he gets there, if hopefully he does get reelected, or we get another America First president, they're going to count on there being an America First Congress.
[01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:11.123]  So the public has to unify behind the America First candidates.
[01:27:11.562 --> 01:27:12.983]  This midterm election.
[01:27:13.483 --> 01:27:16.425]  Oh, I mean, I think Trump's doing a lot of good getting good people elected.
[01:27:16.445 --> 01:27:17.646]  He's not perfect, obviously.
[01:27:18.166 --> 01:27:21.709]  We need to keep him more on the straight and narrow.
[01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:23.370]  I wouldn't even say keep him honest.
[01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:28.273]  I've noticed you can really influence Trump when you get to talk to him, but again, he's not perfect.
[01:27:28.293 --> 01:27:32.216]  He's almost 80 years old like Biden, but still a lot better shaped than Biden mentally.
[01:27:32.956 --> 01:27:33.577]  So I hear you.
[01:27:33.677 --> 01:27:34.177]  Absolutely.
[01:27:34.317 --> 01:27:38.700]  I will get behind the populist nationalist candidate, the pro-life candidate 110%.
[01:27:38.740 --> 01:27:40.101]  I appreciate your call.
[01:27:41.713 --> 01:27:44.175]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Brenda in Nevada.
[01:27:44.215 --> 01:27:45.476]  Brenda, thanks for holding your own here.
[01:27:46.997 --> 01:27:47.658]  Hi, Alex.
[01:27:47.778 --> 01:27:48.999]  It's so nice to talk to you.
[01:27:49.479 --> 01:27:51.901]  I've been a longtime listener since the 90s.
[01:27:52.341 --> 01:27:54.443]  I was live with you at the G20.
[01:27:55.804 --> 01:27:58.246]  That was intense broadcast.
[01:27:58.886 --> 01:28:25.050]   But in any case, I wanted to bring up last week when you were going down memory lane, and I thought Jim Tucker should have been mentioned just because, you know, he was super evident in Bringing the Bilderberg to the forefront and I don't know, I just thought it would be great to, you know, mention him as well when you were mentioning all the great people that were on your show.
[01:28:26.661 --> 01:28:27.361]  Absolutely.
[01:28:27.381 --> 01:28:30.283]  I mean, Jim Tucker was just amazing.
[01:28:31.083 --> 01:28:34.405]  And when I learned he died, it was like nine years ago, it was like a punch in the stomach.
[01:28:34.945 --> 01:28:40.807]  What an icon, exposing the Bilderberg Group that nobody else had, being ridiculed for decades, and now, we're all Bilderberg Group's real?
[01:28:40.847 --> 01:28:41.648]  Yeah, they want world government?
[01:28:41.668 --> 01:28:42.048]  Big deal.
[01:28:42.548 --> 01:28:46.010]  Imagine the power they had of people not even knowing there was a group doing this.
[01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:50.112]  Once the people realize there's this group taking over, we can stand up and say no.
[01:28:50.192 --> 01:28:55.474]  And the former head of the Bilderberg Group is the head of the Davos Group, and he puts out their agenda publicly.
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:28:59.162]  Absolutely, and I totally agree with you.
[01:28:59.182 --> 01:29:09.409]  And then I also wanted to bring up, just I was thinking about what you brought up about Russia and the Vatican and the Pope and his, you know, his switch.
[01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:17.914]  And how I just was thinking how they're really caught up in the Federal Reserve and how our economy is crashing.
[01:29:17.934 --> 01:29:24.879]  And I started thinking about their gold supply and what if that's been depleted?
[01:29:26.265 --> 01:29:32.507]  And maybe that would be a reason for them switching over and siding with Russia all of a sudden.
[01:29:32.807 --> 01:29:35.027]  It just was something I was thinking about.
[01:29:37.928 --> 01:29:40.829]  They have to bring down the old system to bring in the new.
[01:29:41.749 --> 01:29:43.609]  Russia's going to a gold and silverback system.
[01:29:44.569 --> 01:29:53.291]  China and the United States and others are going to programmable tokens that track and trace everything you do so they can then control what you're allowed to spend it on.
[01:29:53.351 --> 01:29:53.932]  That's official.
[01:29:54.552 --> 01:29:55.352]  That's where we are right now.
[01:29:56.673 --> 01:30:05.383]  Yes, do you think that the Pope would be, do you think that possibly the Vatican might have a gold issue, where they're missing gold?
[01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:08.867]  I don't know, I really can't speculate on that.
[01:30:10.128 --> 01:30:15.474]  I don't know, the Vatican's been hoarding money for over a thousand years, so God knows what they've got.
[01:30:16.035 --> 01:30:16.796]  That would be speculative.
[01:30:17.216 --> 01:30:31.316]  I know this, all the major countries have been run by private central banks that have created quadrillions, thousands of trillions in fake currency to buy all the real assets up and now they're purposely shutting the economy off to vertically integrate and take more control.
[01:30:31.376 --> 01:30:34.120]  So this is economic raping that is going on.
[01:30:34.440 --> 01:30:35.501]  Thank you so much for the call, Brenda.
[01:30:35.521 --> 01:30:40.847]  All right, Brian and Jeff, if you want to hold, I'll get to you later in the hour with our special guest Pete Santelli.
[01:30:41.287 --> 01:30:52.138]  We've got a very important Gregory's Report coming up, and then I'll go to Pete Santelli, who has really done a lot of deep research into the providence and the background of this big UN treaty where they're having from the 22nd to the 28th.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:31:00.322]  In Switzerland, this big meeting for the big medical tyranny takeover, where the UN will run all your health care.
[01:31:00.342 --> 01:31:01.322]  I mean, they even admit it.
[01:31:01.562 --> 01:31:04.123]  They're on the news saying, yeah, we'd have the UN running everything.
[01:31:04.523 --> 01:31:06.384]  That is coming up next segment.
[01:31:06.404 --> 01:31:11.125]  There isn't a more critical issue in stopping the next lockdown and power grab.
[01:31:11.365 --> 01:31:12.366]  Pete Santelli straight ahead.
[01:31:12.206 --> 01:31:19.206]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:19.206 --> 01:31:25.545]   Back in 2008, while the masses flocked to Obama to save them from Dick Cheney, those
[01:31:25.545 --> 01:31:31.244]   waking up to the American nightmare could clearly see how he was a puppet to Wall Street
[01:31:31.244 --> 01:31:33.145]  and the big banks.
[01:31:33.145 --> 01:31:35.985]  And also to the military-industrial complex.
[01:31:36.770 --> 01:31:40.772]  Their profits soared as the anti-war movement disappeared.
[01:31:41.552 --> 01:31:46.375]  Obama even had an American citizen killed with a drone strike while eating dinner.
[01:31:47.135 --> 01:31:51.597]  Obama loved predator drones, and he normalized the unending war.
[01:31:52.097 --> 01:31:53.198]  I have two words for you.
[01:31:54.018 --> 01:31:54.899]  Predator drones.
[01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:03.523]  You will never see it coming.
[01:32:03.563 --> 01:32:04.183]  You think I'm joking?
[01:32:06.846 --> 01:32:10.108]  At first, Obama was not threatened by the election of Donald Trump.
[01:32:10.409 --> 01:32:12.750]  He had the all-powerful media on his side.
[01:32:13.090 --> 01:32:18.034]  President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!
[01:32:18.374 --> 01:32:19.295]  Exclamation point.
[01:32:20.336 --> 01:32:21.737]  At real Donald Trump.
[01:32:23.878 --> 01:32:25.039]  At real Donald Trump.
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:28.882]  At least I will go down as a president.
[01:32:30.963 --> 01:32:31.944]  But that didn't last.
[01:32:36.679 --> 01:32:48.328]  If we fall for- Trump got elected, and Obama helped lead a massive attack against him with the entire establishment, mainstream media, and loyal Democrats.
[01:32:48.868 --> 01:32:56.014]  And by the time the 2020 election was stolen right before our eyes, there was no doubt that Joe Biden was a puppet.
[01:32:56.834 --> 01:32:57.675]  But whose puppet?
[01:32:58.035 --> 01:33:09.999]  I think it's no surprise to know that it's not just Obama, but it's the whole Obama-Clinton machine that has been in power for a long time and continues to pull the strings behind the curtain in the Biden administration.
[01:33:10.059 --> 01:33:20.943]  But when we're talking about this ministry of truth, Will, what's even more disturbing than the fact that you have all these Democrats who are supporting it is that there are powerful Republicans who are supporting it as well.
[01:33:21.343 --> 01:33:29.687]  Obama and Clinton are puppets, along with at least 99% of all the Democrats and Republicans in Congress.
[01:33:30.347 --> 01:33:32.008]  And it's not even a government anymore.
[01:33:32.308 --> 01:33:38.851]  It's a criminal cabal made up of several crime families and corporations that see the people as a commodity.
[01:33:39.651 --> 01:33:56.666]  And now, while being exposed for some of the biggest crimes in American history, they are stealing every last penny from the American people, creating a worldwide famine, and provoking a war with a country that is showing off ways they can nuke we the people into oblivion.
[01:33:57.671 --> 01:34:07.173]  In Germany, hundreds of thousands of people are demanding that their government stop sending weapons to Ukraine, and urging them to move towards a peaceful resolution.
[01:34:07.953 --> 01:34:17.235]  While in America, it seems as if everyone is just going about their business, waiting for the next election, as if it's just a series on Netflix we are watching.
[01:34:17.836 --> 01:34:23.857]  But if we sit and do nothing, as we watch them start a nuclear war, are we innocent?
[01:34:25.117 --> 01:34:25.498]  The U.S.
[01:34:25.538 --> 01:34:33.948]  government is training Ukrainian soldiers in Germany and supplying Ukraine with hundreds of newly declassified suicide drones.
[01:34:35.069 --> 01:34:37.212]  The liars and thieves inhabiting the U.S.
[01:34:37.272 --> 01:34:40.977]  government are starting this war for their own puppet masters.
[01:34:41.497 --> 01:34:42.637]  But they are no one special.
[01:34:42.957 --> 01:34:46.858]  Just old, old money with centuries of fraud.
[01:34:47.499 --> 01:34:50.859]  And we outnumber them 10,000 to one, conservatively.
[01:34:51.660 --> 01:34:52.760]  They are not going to stop.
[01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:56.421]  And now that they are being exposed, it's just going to get worse.
[01:34:57.141 --> 01:35:04.303]  And so, wouldn't it be beautiful if we the people can stand up for what's right and stop World War III?
[01:35:05.422 --> 01:35:09.422]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:35:09.422 --> 01:35:25.422]   Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:35:25.422 --> 01:35:26.261]  Bye.
[01:35:26.261 --> 01:35:36.261]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:35:27.644 --> 01:35:47.819]  For the balance of the hour, Pete Santilli, journalist, former Marine, former political prisoner who was then, had the charges dropped against him for the whole Bundy crisis out on the Pacific Northwest, joins us because he's been doing some of the best reporting and breakdown of the global government takeover.
[01:35:47.879 --> 01:35:53.768]   Now I have literally I counted them, more than 70 articles and documents here in
[01:35:53.768 --> 01:35:54.768]  front of me.
[01:35:54.768 --> 01:35:58.288]  Everything we're going to lay out is on record.
[01:35:58.288 --> 01:36:02.408]   Here's the memorandum on strengthening World Health Organization preparedness and a response
[01:36:02.408 --> 01:36:03.689]  to health emergencies.
[01:36:03.689 --> 01:36:05.927]  This is the UN takeover of health care.
[01:36:05.927 --> 01:36:08.009]  This is the holy grail that Bill Gates wants.
[01:36:08.009 --> 01:36:09.927]  He says more pandemics are coming.
[01:36:09.927 --> 01:36:14.469]   And then we've discovered that Obama, and we covered this some of the time, put in this
[01:36:14.469 --> 01:36:19.288]   medical martial law right before he left saying, if we even think you're sick or you have a
[01:36:19.288 --> 01:36:22.168]  cough we can secretly arrest you and disappear you.
[01:36:22.168 --> 01:36:24.809]  And other states have now passed laws to mirror this.
[01:36:24.809 --> 01:36:26.568]  So this is their big plan.
[01:36:26.568 --> 01:36:31.769]   We had Pastor Rodney Howard Brown on that pointed out that in 2005, George W. Bush was
[01:36:31.769 --> 01:36:36.568]   pushing similar things of 15 days to slow the spread, mask, social distancing.
[01:36:36.568 --> 01:36:43.009]   So this has been a long-term plan, older than even Operation Lockstep 2011 for the Rockefeller
[01:36:43.009 --> 01:36:44.009]  Foundation.
[01:36:44.009 --> 01:36:45.009]  This is their big push.
[01:36:45.515 --> 01:36:48.596]  And now you have the CDC saying, we're above the courts, we want you to wear a mask.
[01:36:48.876 --> 01:36:53.758]  We're above the courts to take over the owners of rent properties.
[01:36:54.358 --> 01:37:03.201]  This is how they intend to keep us scared and under control while they roll out the new world government currency, the new carbon tax, the new social credit score.
[01:37:03.541 --> 01:37:05.582]  So Pete, I'm gonna, we got four minutes to break.
[01:37:05.602 --> 01:37:11.964]  I'm gonna try to give you the floor in the 45 minutes of airtime or so we have here today with you to just go through this.
[01:37:12.004 --> 01:37:12.685]  Thanks for being with us.
[01:37:12.705 --> 01:37:13.765]  You do a great job laying it out.
[01:37:15.513 --> 01:37:16.474]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:37:16.694 --> 01:37:29.202]  You know, I want to make a couple of things really clear because now that we're starting to bring some public awareness to this, and of course you've been covering it the past several days, people have been talking about a pandemic treaty.
[01:37:30.022 --> 01:37:38.627]  Let's set that aside because the pandemic treaty, I think, is a diversion to what's going to take place here May 22nd through the 28th.
[01:37:38.647 --> 01:37:44.381]   Now, I've been in consultation with James Roguski, he's done the deepest research.
[01:37:44.421 --> 01:37:46.903]  He was one of the first ones that I had landed on.
[01:37:47.283 --> 01:37:52.228]  And then I checked all of his work, and darn it, wouldn't you know it, all the documentation's out there.
[01:37:52.268 --> 01:37:56.231]  So, I just had a conversation with Dr. Peter Bregan.
[01:37:56.311 --> 01:37:57.712]  He wrote the book, I have it here.
[01:37:58.273 --> 01:38:01.796]  Dr. Peter Bregan, COVID-19 and the Global Predators.
[01:38:02.677 --> 01:38:12.661]   He's identified, over the past week and a half or so, where I've been trying to pinpoint Who the culprit is here as to what they're going to do, May 22nd through the 28th.
[01:38:12.821 --> 01:38:23.645]  They're essentially going to give total dictatorial authoritarian power to the communist dictator Tedros at the top of the WHO.
[01:38:24.465 --> 01:38:26.005]  Now who's behind Tedros?
[01:38:26.845 --> 01:38:38.369]  We know and it's well documented, even Fox News, the New York Times, several different outlets have covered this, that China, the Chinese communists have essentially put Tedros in power.
[01:38:39.623 --> 01:38:45.688]  So essentially this is a... And Bill Gates is allied with China, saying their response was great, they should take the world over.
[01:38:45.708 --> 01:38:47.269]  So it's Bill Gates and China.
[01:38:48.348 --> 01:38:48.768]  That's right.
[01:38:48.868 --> 01:38:57.254]  And Bill Gates, I was I was targeting Bill Gates because Bill Gates is identified, especially when President Trump pulled our support of the WHO.
[01:38:57.534 --> 01:39:01.237]  Bill Gates came in and he became the top funder of the WHO.
[01:39:01.257 --> 01:39:02.357]  So I thought it was Bill Gates.
[01:39:02.818 --> 01:39:04.759]  Well, he stands to benefit, certainly.
[01:39:05.019 --> 01:39:09.962]  But this this is all being driven by the communist Chinese.
[01:39:10.243 --> 01:39:10.943]  No doubt about it.
[01:39:11.043 --> 01:39:14.746]  Bill Gates is actually an asset for the Taichung government.
[01:39:15.126 --> 01:39:17.808]  But this is what they're going to do on the 22nd through the 28th.
[01:39:18.788 --> 01:39:31.312]  Now, just a matter of a couple weeks ago, the United States of America, through the Biden administration, filed some amendments to the international health regulations.
[01:39:31.372 --> 01:39:36.514]  And essentially, that's the legally binding document that's been in place since the 40s.
[01:39:37.014 --> 01:39:51.185]   We agreed that the WHO would help us with the potential with a global pandemic, but we would ultimately have say so through the CDC and through the Um, uh, through the FDA and so on and so forth.
[01:39:51.205 --> 01:39:56.853]  If there's a global pandemic, well, April 12th, they filed the document essentially.
[01:39:58.058 --> 01:40:09.842]  Relinquishing their responsibility, giving total and complete control to the centralized authority, just like Yuval Harari says we need to do a better job with international control of pandemics.
[01:40:10.402 --> 01:40:20.846]  Well, the 22nd through the 28th, these delegations, 194 countries are going to get together and they're going to vote on those amendments that were proposed by the United States of America.
[01:40:21.806 --> 01:40:24.047]  And it was actually filed on April 12th.
[01:40:25.347 --> 01:40:27.488]  Right under our noses, but at the same time hidden.
[01:40:28.075 --> 01:40:33.058]  Now, I had forwarded you some documentation, you covered it earlier in the week.
[01:40:33.518 --> 01:40:36.700]  This process began before we even knew how to spell COVID.
[01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:50.167]  President Barack Obama on January 19th, right before President Trump was sworn into office, a portion of the Federal Register included CDC changes in terminology.
[01:40:52.063 --> 01:40:56.268]  For potential pandemics like with SARS and so on and so forth.
[01:40:56.308 --> 01:40:59.712]  Essentially giving the medical-industrial complex.
[01:40:59.972 --> 01:41:01.774]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:01.854 --> 01:41:02.836]  That break cut us off.
[01:41:02.876 --> 01:41:07.181]  Pete Santelli, investigative journalist, has been through the fire, is our guest.
[01:41:07.661 --> 01:41:15.661]   I have spent months reading these documents, researching what's happening with the UN.
[01:41:15.661 --> 01:41:20.621]   They have a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland that is going to be held the 22nd to 28th.
[01:41:20.621 --> 01:41:27.180]   They say the documents are secret, but their memorandums say the UN will control pandemic
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:29.180]  responses but also other medical policy.
[01:41:29.591 --> 01:41:36.575]  Just like UNESCO controls education policy and the rest of it, we're under UN control.
[01:41:36.615 --> 01:41:42.179]  The corporations fund and control the UN, then our government signed treaties with it and go under its control.
[01:41:42.619 --> 01:41:48.102]  And we need to raise the alarm and get Congress ahead of this and others, because Biden plans to implement all of this.
[01:41:48.162 --> 01:41:50.444]  We have to make this the central issue.
[01:41:50.484 --> 01:41:51.304]  Pete, you got cut off.
[01:41:51.785 --> 01:41:52.445]  Please continue.
[01:41:54.063 --> 01:42:00.308]  You know, first of all, I want everybody to understand the severity of this existential threat.
[01:42:00.328 --> 01:42:01.609]  I'm going to lay this out as follows.
[01:42:01.629 --> 01:42:02.910]  Oh, this is their takeover plan.
[01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:04.011]  This is their main attack.
[01:42:06.889 --> 01:42:07.810]  This is it.
[01:42:08.010 --> 01:42:14.115]  The 22nd through the 28th is even more important than the pandemic treaty that everyone's buzzing about on the internet.
[01:42:14.375 --> 01:42:15.176]  So let me break it down.
[01:42:15.636 --> 01:42:18.839]  40s, we signed a treaty with the WHO.
[01:42:19.239 --> 01:42:21.401]  But we said, we're going to maintain our sovereignty.
[01:42:21.501 --> 01:42:24.623]  We appreciate your help as it relates to global pandemics.
[01:42:24.743 --> 01:42:26.805]  Then they modified the treaties.
[01:42:26.825 --> 01:42:29.827]  2005, they published the most recent one, if you go look it up.
[01:42:30.048 --> 01:42:35.332]  It's called the IHR, the International Health Regulations.
[01:42:36.081 --> 01:42:37.862]  Then they further modified it.
[01:42:37.942 --> 01:42:40.704]  But before they did that, so let's just back up a second.
[01:42:41.044 --> 01:42:47.649]  Obama left office on the 19th of January 2017, right before President Trump took office.
[01:42:48.209 --> 01:42:49.790]  I didn't even know how to spell COVID.
[01:42:50.331 --> 01:42:52.252]  They filed thousands of pages.
[01:42:52.292 --> 01:42:56.335]  The CDC said, we're going to change some verbiage, some definitions.
[01:42:57.635 --> 01:42:59.617]  And there was public commentary.
[01:42:59.677 --> 01:43:03.499]  The public comments and some of those public comments come from attorneys saying, what are you doing?
[01:43:03.519 --> 01:43:05.261]  You're going to surrender our sovereignty to the WHO?
[01:43:06.361 --> 01:43:10.826]  They responded back, HHS and CDC said, no, no, no, no, of course we wouldn't.
[01:43:10.846 --> 01:43:19.155]  Our treaty says that we will maintain control and run in parallel to, you know, to stop a global pandemic with the WHO and partner with them.
[01:43:19.595 --> 01:43:31.517]   Well, April 12th, just a couple of weeks ago, they filed a revision that essentially cancels that out, giving Tedros, who was placed there by the Communist Chinese.
[01:43:31.917 --> 01:43:33.438]  I can pull up articles right now.
[01:43:33.458 --> 01:43:33.919]  Look at this.
[01:43:34.419 --> 01:43:35.500]  A New York Times article.
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:39.643]  Candidate to lead the WHO is accused of covering up pandemics.
[01:43:40.063 --> 01:43:41.825]  This guy was actually placed there.
[01:43:43.046 --> 01:43:47.449]  How the WHO became China's coronavirus accomplice.
[01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:49.190]  And here's another one.
[01:43:49.631 --> 01:43:53.954]  Gates Foundation donations to the WHO nearly match those from the US government.
[01:43:53.974 --> 01:43:55.415]  Let's set Gates aside for a second.
[01:43:56.039 --> 01:44:01.933]  On the 22nd through the 28th, they're going to approve a document that's been kept secret.
[01:44:02.481 --> 01:44:17.244]  Just a couple weeks ago, April 12th, the US, the Biden administration, their delegation is going to go there and vote along with the other member nations, 194 of them, to give Tedros 100% dictatorial power.
[01:44:17.524 --> 01:44:19.345]  And this is what he has the authority to do it.
[01:44:19.865 --> 01:44:21.665]  And it's pronounced fake.
[01:44:22.085 --> 01:44:25.986]  It's a public health emergency of international concern.
[01:44:26.869 --> 01:44:36.832]  Now you can interchange a pandemic of coronavirus or let's say obesity or let's say SEL by the CDC.
[01:44:36.872 --> 01:44:39.213]  They say that they've got a program right now.
[01:44:39.233 --> 01:44:39.613]  That's right.
[01:44:39.633 --> 01:44:41.934]  It says any crisis they then take full control.
[01:44:42.914 --> 01:44:46.215]  It affects public health and it's of international concern.
[01:44:46.775 --> 01:44:54.133]   Once the WHO dictator-in-chief makes that determination, All other nations must follow.
[01:44:54.233 --> 01:44:56.356]  Now, here's another thing that they did underhanded.
[01:44:56.876 --> 01:45:04.466]  Normally, when you sign on to an agreement or you make modifications to the IHR, they have an 18-month cooling down period.
[01:45:04.506 --> 01:45:06.469]  Essentially, you know, let's take a look at the verbiage.
[01:45:06.509 --> 01:45:08.412]  Maybe we didn't understand the legalese.
[01:45:08.967 --> 01:45:12.406]   18 months we can pull out of this thing if we made a mistake.
[01:45:12.406 --> 01:45:14.606]   No, they shortened that to six months.
[01:45:14.606 --> 01:45:18.726]   So here we are two weeks prior to this meeting on the 22nd of May,
[01:45:18.726 --> 01:45:22.986]   that they're going to give Tedros, who was placed by the Chinese
[01:45:22.986 --> 01:45:26.767]   communists, in power, giving him total authority.
[01:45:26.767 --> 01:45:31.006]   Once he declares a fake, they will even sanction countries
[01:45:31.006 --> 01:45:34.447]   for not complying with the WHO mandates still.
[01:45:34.933 --> 01:45:36.294]  Now let's talk about Bill Gates.
[01:45:36.534 --> 01:45:41.078]  Bill Gates and Gavi are the biggest funders of the WHO.
[01:45:41.478 --> 01:45:48.184]  Do you think that Bill Gates has a dog in the fight for Tedros to be the leader of the government that's going to... Tedros is his minion!
[01:45:49.773 --> 01:45:51.194]  It's his minion, absolutely.
[01:45:51.214 --> 01:45:54.896]  Now, I started targeting Bill Gates as the culprit of this thing.
[01:45:54.916 --> 01:45:58.558]  These, you know, of course, the global predators per se.
[01:45:58.798 --> 01:46:04.661]  But I had a conversation with Dr. Peter Bregan after I did the research with James Roguski.
[01:46:04.681 --> 01:46:07.682]  I need to put you in touch with those two because they're very well studied.
[01:46:07.702 --> 01:46:09.983]  But Dr. Bregan... Yeah, we've had Bregan on.
[01:46:10.003 --> 01:46:10.284]  He's great.
[01:46:10.304 --> 01:46:10.944]  We should get him back on.
[01:46:11.914 --> 01:46:20.440]  Dr. Bregin, he's publishing a report today and he identifies documents, it's well documented that the Chai Koms are behind this thing.
[01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:28.885]  The Chinese government are using Tedros as a Trojan horse to bring in their global dominance.
[01:46:28.985 --> 01:46:34.853]  Yeah, that's how you bring in a coup over America is through the medical system because Americans, on average, they've studied in focus groups.
[01:46:35.454 --> 01:46:37.457]  They even had Yale do a study before the pandemic.
[01:46:37.777 --> 01:46:38.879]  How do we get people to bow down?
[01:46:38.919 --> 01:46:40.080]  We use a bioweapon.
[01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:40.821]  We use fear.
[01:46:41.162 --> 01:46:41.943]  We use a virus.
[01:46:41.983 --> 01:46:42.704]  This is how they're doing it.
[01:46:43.703 --> 01:46:44.123]  That's right.
[01:46:44.443 --> 01:46:58.331]  Now the WHO, of course, this election that's going to take place on the 22nd through the 28th, the delegation that's being sent forth through the Biden administration, you know, we can question their authority because they seized an election in 2020.
[01:46:58.631 --> 01:46:59.532]  But let's set that aside.
[01:46:59.612 --> 01:47:02.594]  They're not elected officials that are going to be voting on our behalf.
[01:47:03.454 --> 01:47:27.312]   All these countries Representing 99.44% of the entire world population are literally going to, and I've read the legal documents, they're going to give total and complete control to Tedros, the Qaikom minion, total and complete control to declare a public health emergency of international concern.
[01:47:27.772 --> 01:47:30.835]  Once that gets done, now here's another... Let's be clear, I agree with you.
[01:47:31.075 --> 01:47:32.096]  Even Gates says this now.
[01:47:32.916 --> 01:47:33.957]  I said this for six months.
[01:47:33.977 --> 01:47:35.138]  He just said it yesterday.
[01:47:35.458 --> 01:47:36.059]  We have the clip.
[01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:38.261]  This was a beta test.
[01:47:38.321 --> 01:47:39.782]  The real event, he says, is coming.
[01:47:40.102 --> 01:47:41.043]  Something far worse.
[01:47:41.304 --> 01:47:43.165]  And he's on record developing all these viruses.
[01:47:43.205 --> 01:47:44.987]  This is insanely obvious.
[01:47:46.331 --> 01:47:46.752]  That's right.
[01:47:46.792 --> 01:47:50.937]  Now, here's another big concern that I have, Alex, and I don't know how deep you've covered this.
[01:47:50.977 --> 01:48:00.748]  I know that you covered the, of course, I've done enough research on the snake venom-derived peptides in the vaccines, of course.
[01:48:00.989 --> 01:48:04.393]  Now, the water surveillance system, that's when I learned about this.
[01:48:05.242 --> 01:48:12.246]  Tedros in the WHO, they can declare a public health emergency based on surveillance of the wastewater system.
[01:48:12.506 --> 01:48:17.169]  If they say there's too many, you know, please excuse the term, but this is what they're going to do.
[01:48:17.449 --> 01:48:20.791]  They're going to test the wastewater and say too many people are pooping COVID.
[01:48:20.831 --> 01:48:21.972]  We need to stop the spread.
[01:48:22.272 --> 01:48:24.213]  Let's lock down this zip code.
[01:48:24.254 --> 01:48:26.375]  They admit that global surveillance has moved to sewage.
[01:48:27.705 --> 01:48:33.291]  Right, now they're going to declare a public health emergency based on testing the wastewater.
[01:48:33.471 --> 01:48:40.659]  Do you trust that the CDC testing our wastewater saying that COVID's... No, it's just it's an excuse to just shut things down whenever they want.
[01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:47.647]  It's digital martial law to force us onto phones, tell us where to go, what to do, and I mean they admit all this.
[01:48:48.789 --> 01:48:49.570]  They do.
[01:48:49.610 --> 01:48:50.430]  I've been following.
[01:48:50.570 --> 01:48:56.474]  I got away from this for a while because it was so nauseating listening to MSNBC and CNN, especially during the pandemic.
[01:48:56.694 --> 01:48:57.115]  But you know what?
[01:48:57.135 --> 01:48:58.115]  They're back out at Alex.
[01:48:58.355 --> 01:48:59.076]  I'm listening to them.
[01:48:59.096 --> 01:49:00.297]  They're prescripting the narrative.
[01:49:00.457 --> 01:49:01.778]  They're saying the cases of COVID.
[01:49:01.798 --> 01:49:06.301]  Think about that COVID cases porn with the PCR tests and all that stuff.
[01:49:06.521 --> 01:49:08.022]  They're saying the cases are increasing.
[01:49:08.302 --> 01:49:08.963]  What does that tell you?
[01:49:09.003 --> 01:49:10.303]  We're getting ready for an election.
[01:49:10.624 --> 01:49:15.427]  Time for everyone to get ready to dump their ballots into the ballot drop boxes.
[01:49:15.507 --> 01:49:16.948]  But here's the big concern.
[01:49:17.634 --> 01:49:34.678]  Along with that, with the election coming up, with the potential for election fraud if people are casting mail-in ballots, you've got a WHO dictator, Tedros, who's already been pinpointed by the New York Times for covering up epidemics or pandemics in the past.
[01:49:35.298 --> 01:49:43.196]   This guy will be able to lock down countries and will have There's no doubt about it.
[01:49:43.036 --> 01:49:48.255]   Stay there. All right, peace to Antilles. As you know, a lot of people tune in every minute to minute. So you were
[01:49:48.255 --> 01:49:55.286]   on 20-something minutes ago with us. There's probably 300-400,000 new people tuned in right now. Recap what you were saying
[01:49:55.286 --> 01:50:00.755]   and then get into more details of this number one central issue that is starting to finally get some traction thanks
[01:50:00.755 --> 01:50:03.036]  to you and many others that are exposing it.
[01:50:03.609 --> 01:50:04.930]  We need Tucker Carlson to cover it.
[01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:06.070]  We need Joe Rogan to cover it.
[01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:08.231]  We need the Republican Party to cover it.
[01:50:08.251 --> 01:50:08.772]  We need U.S.
[01:50:08.812 --> 01:50:09.632]  Senators to cover it.
[01:50:09.692 --> 01:50:13.594]  This is central to our sovereignty and to the whole globalist takeover plan.
[01:50:14.735 --> 01:50:15.375]  Absolutely.
[01:50:15.975 --> 01:50:18.637]  You know, Michelle Bachmann, I spoke with her the other day.
[01:50:18.717 --> 01:50:19.637]  She found out about it.
[01:50:19.717 --> 01:50:26.900]   She was just flabbergasted that our congressional officials are clueless as to what's going to
[01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:29.380]  happen on the 22nd through the 28th.
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:29.940]  And Dr.
[01:50:29.940 --> 01:50:33.379]   Bregan told me last night that essentially, and I'm going to go
[01:50:33.379 --> 01:50:34.719]  ahead and do the recap.
[01:50:34.719 --> 01:50:37.600]   He told me that there's no way to stop this thing.
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:42.880]   The 22nd through the 28th, this huge body of 194 countries
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:48.499]   representing 99% of the world's population are going to vote to
[01:50:48.499 --> 01:50:53.600]   give Tedros, the person that was placed there by the Thai comms,
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:56.600]  Winnie the Pooh, whatever his name is.
[01:50:56.092 --> 01:51:03.851]   placed at the top of the WHO to give him total dictatorial power to declare a public health
[01:51:03.851 --> 01:51:06.092]  emergency of international concern.
[01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:07.992]  Why is that vague and ambiguous?
[01:51:07.992 --> 01:51:13.532]   Because they can swap it out with COVID, they can do obesity, whatever public health emergency
[01:51:13.532 --> 01:51:15.372]  is of international concern.
[01:51:15.372 --> 01:51:18.372]  It's a blank check.
[01:51:18.468 --> 01:51:19.189]  And guess what?
[01:51:19.589 --> 01:51:21.089]  They're going to supersede!
[01:51:21.509 --> 01:51:37.394]  I mean, they're literally saying, we will partner with, and have everyone follow along with us, the United Nations, which the World Economic Forum is a part of, of course, the International Labor Organizations, Food and Agricultural Organizations, International Atomic Energy Agency.
[01:51:37.714 --> 01:51:41.415]  They will have power over every major international agency.
[01:51:41.776 --> 01:51:46.057]  And I'm going to have to revert back to you, Paul Harari, because I think I heard it on Infowars.
[01:51:46.738 --> 01:51:53.433]  Harari says we need to do a better job this time stopping global pandemics from from spreading.
[01:51:53.874 --> 01:52:03.766]   All of these nations I'm going to tell you right now, they only have English versions of the modifications, the ones that were submitted by the Biden administration on April 12th.
[01:52:04.167 --> 01:52:07.650]  These other countries that speak foreign languages, it's a legal document.
[01:52:07.670 --> 01:52:09.692]  It's going to be legally binding with the IHR.
[01:52:10.273 --> 01:52:16.379]  They don't even have copies of the translation that they're going to be voting on on the 22nd through the 28th.
[01:52:16.659 --> 01:52:26.328]   Now, of course, They're going to go to this thing, send the delegations there thinking, well, we have 18 months to kind of ruminate and figure out whether or not we want to stay with it.
[01:52:26.748 --> 01:52:28.069]  No, they changed that as well.
[01:52:28.409 --> 01:52:32.453]  They said now there's only going to be a six month period where they can opt out.
[01:52:33.113 --> 01:52:40.940]  These countries have no idea, our own elected officials have no idea, or they're complicit in this thing to release our sovereignty.
[01:52:41.821 --> 01:52:58.501]   Alex, I don't mean to over sensationalize by saying this, What this represents on the 22nd through the 28th, Biden is going to send his delegation to Geneva and vote to have the WHO flag fly over the United States flag.
[01:52:59.207 --> 01:53:04.188]  And I would say WHO, the United Nations, and then the U.S.
[01:53:04.228 --> 01:53:04.469]  flag.
[01:53:04.489 --> 01:53:10.350]  Can you imagine what our elected officials are going to say when we ask them what they're doing to stop this global tyranny?
[01:53:10.370 --> 01:53:15.952]  They're going to say, well, you know, it's a legally binding international health regulation.
[01:53:16.372 --> 01:53:19.933]  We've had a treaty dating all the way back to 1948 or 46.
[01:53:20.313 --> 01:53:21.033]  That's right.
[01:53:21.053 --> 01:53:21.653]  So the U.S.
[01:53:21.693 --> 01:53:23.534]  has to move to pull out of that treaty.
[01:53:25.419 --> 01:53:27.481]  They do, and they only have six months.
[01:53:27.701 --> 01:53:31.703]  We're in a position right now, they filed for the amendments April 12th.
[01:53:32.724 --> 01:53:34.625]  Most people have no idea what was contained in it.
[01:53:34.926 --> 01:53:36.687]  It gives Tejo's total power.
[01:53:37.708 --> 01:53:42.351]  Then, once they vote on it, there's going to be public outrage, which there will be after the effect.
[01:53:42.651 --> 01:53:44.933]  There will only be six months to undo the damage.
[01:53:45.373 --> 01:53:47.074]  So, is there any way to stop it?
[01:53:47.154 --> 01:53:52.097]  Dr. Peter Bragan told me last night, there's no way to stop what's coming on May 22nd.
[01:53:53.258 --> 01:53:54.559]  It's up to we the people.
[01:53:54.959 --> 01:54:00.623]  Congress is going to do nothing if not being part of this scam to bring global governance.
[01:54:00.723 --> 01:54:02.624]  As we already know, they've been pushing for that.
[01:54:02.664 --> 01:54:07.547]  I'm sure Hillary Clinton, if she was in in 2016, we would have been talking about this in 2017.
[01:54:08.508 --> 01:54:18.617]   And by the way, let's remember, They have headlines in Bloomberg, Washington Post, Financial Times saying dictatorship is good, and the dictatorship should be corporations through the UN.
[01:54:19.198 --> 01:54:22.721]  Everything we've talked about, Pete, forever, is now in our face.
[01:54:22.761 --> 01:54:23.522]  There's no debate.
[01:54:23.862 --> 01:54:25.104]  So where are the Republicans?
[01:54:25.524 --> 01:54:28.207]  Well, they give some lip service, but they're bought and paid for too.
[01:54:29.833 --> 01:54:33.075]  You know, that man right there that you have on the screen, can you imagine?
[01:54:33.135 --> 01:54:39.598]  Fox News even reported what was the date of this when he was just basically re-elected.
[01:54:39.718 --> 01:54:46.681]  Controversial World Health Organization Chief Tedros was nominated and brought in for a second term unopposed.
[01:54:46.821 --> 01:54:48.142]  Fauci said he's a good guy.
[01:54:48.562 --> 01:54:50.523]  This guy is Fauci on steroids.
[01:54:50.823 --> 01:54:59.087]  If you're upset about the little mini tyrant Fauci, wait till Tedros takes power after this thing is voted on the 22nd through the 28th.
[01:54:59.967 --> 01:55:00.788]  Is there a way to stop him?
[01:55:00.808 --> 01:55:01.928]  Pete, how do you think we stop him?
[01:55:01.948 --> 01:55:03.749]  We expose it first, but what else?
[01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:13.054]  Alright, yesterday I got permission from, I had James Roguski on, we did a full presentation to produce content, to put the word out there.
[01:55:13.334 --> 01:55:23.799]  I got permission from him to not only use his site, DontYouDare.info, to take that and mirror it and put it on Infowars.com.
[01:55:23.839 --> 01:55:26.040]  You're going to have his full permission to do that.
[01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:32.185]  That is all the information that's contained so that we can get people properly educated, and then we need to take action.
[01:55:32.865 --> 01:55:39.431]  We need to demand that this delegation that is going, and we only have a couple of weeks here, to try to stop this.
[01:55:39.451 --> 01:55:40.292]  It's going to be difficult.
[01:55:40.632 --> 01:55:46.417]  We need a public awareness campaign as if our sovereignty is at stake, because in fact it is.
[01:55:46.757 --> 01:55:50.640]  They should have no authority to go vote on our behalf, and no way, shape, or form.
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:52.381]  They should actually be stopped.
[01:55:52.662 --> 01:55:56.141]   There should be a travel ban on these people from going to Geneva,
[01:55:56.141 --> 01:55:59.802]   because of what they're about to do that no American would approve.
[01:55:59.802 --> 01:56:03.261]   No member of Congress should approve any such delegation to go
[01:56:03.261 --> 01:56:04.282]  do such a thing.
[01:56:04.282 --> 01:56:07.261]   And most of them have never even seen the revisions that were
[01:56:07.261 --> 01:56:09.041]  submitted on April 12th, Alex.
[01:56:09.041 --> 01:56:09.762]  It is shocking.
[01:56:09.762 --> 01:56:12.082]   We need to notify members of Congress.
[01:56:12.082 --> 01:56:13.681]  We need all hands on deck.
[01:56:13.681 --> 01:56:16.561]   There's Democrats, I'm sure, that are going to be even opposed
[01:56:16.561 --> 01:56:20.282]   to this thing, as they were opposed to electronic voting machine fraud.
[01:56:20.282 --> 01:56:24.560]   That they should be stepping up to We're going to sign away our sovereignty, Alex.
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:31.865]  We need to put out the all-hands-on-deck alert to bring public awareness, not just in the United States, the entire world.
[01:56:31.885 --> 01:56:36.248]  Because here's another thing, and we've got a couple minutes here, I want to emphasize this point.
[01:56:37.523 --> 01:56:49.037]  If in fact, just like we did last time, President Trump opted out of the WHO, Bill Gates backfilled it and actually became an even bigger contributor through GAVI and through the Gates Foundation.
[01:56:49.437 --> 01:56:54.163]  Became a bigger contributor to the WHO than the US was contributing.
[01:56:54.643 --> 01:57:01.926]  If we opt out this next time around, there's 193 other member nations that will have a vote.
[01:57:02.186 --> 01:57:08.849]  They're going to treat us like a bunch of, you know, MAGA red hat wearing deplorable extremists in the United States.
[01:57:08.869 --> 01:57:10.310]  They'll stop us from traveling.
[01:57:10.650 --> 01:57:12.431]  They'll stop international commerce.
[01:57:12.551 --> 01:57:21.800]  Well they've already set the precedent where you can't criticize any decision of the WHO on the internet and all the big tech comes in and says that's a dictatorship, a medical dictatorship.
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:22.561]  This is insane.
[01:57:22.821 --> 01:57:27.686]  They've already censored senators, congressmen, governors, legislators.
[01:57:27.746 --> 01:57:29.027]  I mean, this is it!
[01:57:29.447 --> 01:57:31.810]  We have to recognize it's a takeover and say no!
[01:57:33.098 --> 01:57:37.100]  Alex, I want to find the exact verbiage, but this is what I discovered.
[01:57:37.140 --> 01:57:42.303]  We're hearing a lot about these disinformation bureaus.
[01:57:42.743 --> 01:57:46.786]  We now found out that in Ukraine they have one with hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:57:46.806 --> 01:57:54.370]  Oh, they're giving it $8 billion, excuse me, out of the $33 billion, $8.8 billion at Ministry of Truth, and now they've announced one here.
[01:57:55.695 --> 01:58:00.579]  It's going to be upwards of a billion dollars, a ministry of truth that the WHO is going to regulate.
[01:58:00.619 --> 01:58:07.946]  If you say anything that is counter to the narrative, that you, you know, if you say snake venom peptides, they should have it.
[01:58:07.986 --> 01:58:10.348]  Pete, it just broke today, you may have missed it.
[01:58:10.528 --> 01:58:14.752]  It's 8.8 billion in Ukraine alone from the 33 billion Biden's giving.
[01:58:16.184 --> 01:58:20.326]  Craziness, craziness, and that's just for war propaganda spreading.
[01:58:20.346 --> 01:58:27.308]  Can you imagine when Tedros gets a hold of a Ministry of Truth to stop the spread of COVID misinformation?
[01:58:27.588 --> 01:58:28.729]  He'll be arrested for saying that.
[01:58:28.749 --> 01:58:29.689]  This is their takeover.
[01:58:29.729 --> 01:58:30.249]  This is it.
[01:58:30.269 --> 01:58:30.709]  We're on it.
[01:58:30.729 --> 01:58:34.531]  We'll talk about more details of it, how we stop it, with the great Pete Santilli.
[01:58:34.551 --> 01:58:40.053]  Straight ahead, find Pete's show, ThePeteSantilliShow.com, and on Truth Social, at Pete Santilli.
[01:58:41.013 --> 01:58:42.574]  We'll be right back with this great researcher.
[01:58:42.594 --> 01:58:43.294]  Please stay with us.
[01:58:43.394 --> 01:58:44.555]  InfoWars.com.
[01:58:44.595 --> 01:58:47.136]  Tomorrow's news today, Pete Santilli.
[01:58:47.156 --> 01:58:47.576]  Stay with us.
[01:58:47.996 --> 01:58:51.038]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to be very, very clear right now with all of you.
[01:58:52.198 --> 01:58:54.019]  People say, Jones, don't you feel empowered?
[01:58:54.079 --> 01:58:55.380]  Everything you talked about came true.
[01:58:55.440 --> 01:58:55.920]  No, I don't.
[01:58:56.820 --> 01:59:01.883]  There is nothing more frustrating than reading globalist documents and watching clips of their speeches.
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:11.588]  For 30 years on Air 28 and knowing they're in power and knowing they're doing this and sitting here and having to debate whether or not they even exist.
[01:59:14.811 --> 01:59:19.876]  And to know that they made the weapon that killed members of my family and almost killed my dad.
[01:59:21.638 --> 01:59:23.780]  And to know they're going to come back and do it even worse.
[01:59:25.641 --> 01:59:28.064]  And we have the power to stop them!
[01:59:29.864 --> 01:59:36.168]  And now we're literally going back to 1776, but not the British winning, but the New World Order winning.
[01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:40.631]  And all the hell and the lockdowns and the starvation that comes with it.
[01:59:40.992 --> 01:59:42.973]  We have to stop this, folks.
[01:59:43.833 --> 01:59:45.833]  It's all right there.
[01:59:45.833 --> 01:59:54.573]   Peace, Santelli. I'm going to let you host the rest of the segment.
[01:59:55.502 --> 01:59:56.462]  I'm gonna shut up for 10 minutes.
[01:59:56.482 --> 01:59:57.263]  You got the floor, go ahead.
[01:59:59.366 --> 02:00:05.512]  You know, that document I forwarded to you, the federal registry, okay?
[02:00:05.572 --> 02:00:25.871]   This is how important that federal registry is, is that bureaucracies, such as the Department of Interior, the CDC, no matter what they are, government bureaucracies, instead of going through the legislature, if they have an important concern, they can document it, put it into the registry, allow for public comment, And then it bypasses regulatory or legislative process.
[02:00:26.151 --> 02:00:27.332]  It actually becomes law.
[02:00:27.732 --> 02:00:36.000]  Back in January, this is how important those filings were changing the definitions of non-invasive and it was worded.
[02:00:36.906 --> 02:00:45.050]  As if an attorney was speaking out of seven sides of his mouth that essentially says that sticking a probe in your nose is going to be non-invasive.
[02:00:45.210 --> 02:00:47.150]  That's one of the most invasive things you can do.
[02:00:47.511 --> 02:00:57.815]  Here's another thing that they put in there is apprehension of individuals that are not compliant or potentially spreading diseases that are of international concern.
[02:00:58.504 --> 02:01:02.549]  They already have all of the laws set up, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:03.009 --> 02:01:07.374]  Obama did it right before he left, the day before President Trump came in office.
[02:01:07.495 --> 02:01:16.145]  And I believe, as we've learned here on InforWars over the past several decades, the Hegelian dialectic, problem, reaction.
[02:01:17.210 --> 02:01:19.592]  They bring the crisis.
[02:01:19.973 --> 02:01:24.677]  They know what the reaction to the crisis will be, and then they offer the solution to the crisis.
[02:01:25.037 --> 02:01:30.081]  Their solution is on May 22nd and 28th to centralize control.
[02:01:30.261 --> 02:01:39.409]  It is the global governance that will come giving a person who is, I would consider it to be an enemy of the United States of America.
[02:01:40.210 --> 02:01:43.733]  The China virus was released from the Wuhan lab.
[02:01:45.112 --> 02:01:48.274]  That was the, of course, the crisis that was created.
[02:01:49.375 --> 02:01:52.777]  The world was outraged by the number of deaths that took place.
[02:01:52.898 --> 02:01:54.199]  And how do we solve the problem?
[02:01:54.579 --> 02:02:03.446]  Centralized control with the dictator in chief, Tedros, who is a proxy, a Trojan horse for the Chinese Communist Party.
[02:02:04.366 --> 02:02:11.788]  Now, we have a delegation that is going to be voting to make him the world's dictator over world health matters.
[02:02:11.948 --> 02:02:14.909]  Imagine how powerful these people were in the hospitals.
[02:02:14.949 --> 02:02:24.691]  Can you imagine a health care worker having so much authority over you that you can't even go see your family members or you'll be arrested for trespassing?
[02:02:25.071 --> 02:02:26.472]  They know what's best for you.
[02:02:26.792 --> 02:02:32.013]  They know the last remaining moments of life of your loved one.
[02:02:32.373 --> 02:02:35.574]  It's going to be taken care of because, of course, we can't spread the pandemic.
[02:02:36.035 --> 02:02:39.876]  They are perpetrating one of the biggest psyops, of course, to do what?
[02:02:40.096 --> 02:02:42.257]  This is the pretext for what is to come here.
[02:02:42.717 --> 02:02:44.638]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is coming.
[02:02:45.319 --> 02:02:50.361]  Dr. Bregan has told me there's no way to stop what's happening May 22nd to 28th.
[02:02:50.661 --> 02:02:52.862]  But what we can do is to bring public awareness.
[02:02:53.582 --> 02:02:55.583]  I want everybody to share this information.
[02:02:55.623 --> 02:03:03.739]   Now, the information that's included on the website, if you go to don't YouDare.info.
[02:03:03.779 --> 02:03:04.799]  It's got all that info.
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:10.323]  Hopefully, Alex will have it replicated and mirrored on Infowars.com as well.
[02:03:10.703 --> 02:03:13.645]  Share this information far and wide and use those toolkits.
[02:03:14.406 --> 02:03:18.608]  There's memes, there's letters that you can send out to your congresspeople.
[02:03:18.628 --> 02:03:20.770]  We need to pick up the phones and let them know what's happening.
[02:03:20.830 --> 02:03:21.430]  And guess what?
[02:03:21.771 --> 02:03:28.255]   The delegation that's going there, they're going to be aligning with the Chinese Communist A Trojan horse?
[02:03:28.475 --> 02:03:29.356]  That's treason!
[02:03:29.676 --> 02:03:35.540]  Surrendering our sovereignty to the chi-coms is nothing that any American would approve of.
[02:03:35.580 --> 02:03:38.121]  And I don't care where you are on the political spectrum.
[02:03:38.402 --> 02:03:40.443]  They just don't know at this point, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:03:40.703 --> 02:03:45.406]  We need to get our elected officials educated and do so ASAP.
[02:03:45.426 --> 02:03:51.667]   Now, if you ever wondered Why the election was rigged in 2020 to give to put Joe Biden in office.
[02:03:52.068 --> 02:03:58.373]  It was to get this delegation and these lead behind networks that have been working on the language.
[02:03:58.413 --> 02:04:02.637]  Can you imagine the federal registry of thousands and thousands of pages?
[02:04:03.097 --> 02:04:07.581]  Hundreds and hundreds of attorneys have been working on this for years, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:08.081 --> 02:04:11.304]  Alex has been telling us, I'm not saying this to suck up to him.
[02:04:11.344 --> 02:04:19.430]   He was the one That said that this would be coming, and I remember thinking he was a conspiracy theorist when I started listening to him 25 years ago.
[02:04:19.931 --> 02:04:31.198]  Everything that he said over time that I have checked as slowly but surely, and of course most recently very incrementally, edged us towards this global government, governance.
[02:04:31.718 --> 02:04:35.681]  It is here, it is now, and it's going to be up to we the people.
[02:04:35.721 --> 02:04:37.362]  We're the last line of defense here.
[02:04:37.442 --> 02:04:39.103]  Now, I say last line of defense.
[02:04:39.523 --> 02:04:40.784]  Do not bring violence.
[02:04:42.156 --> 02:04:53.359]  We need to be very loud and very, very vigorous and waste no time whatsoever between now and the 22nd, knowing full well that we're not going to have a good chance at stopping them.
[02:04:53.379 --> 02:04:59.440]  But we need to bring public awareness worldwide to every member nation and all of their citizens.
[02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:07.302]  Those people have no clue what they're about to sign on to, because they don't even have a copy of the translated document that they're going to be signing off on.
[02:05:08.302 --> 02:05:16.044]  They think they'll have 18 months to read through it and have their legal consultation to determine whether or not it was a good deal or not?
[02:05:16.344 --> 02:05:17.744]  No, they only have six months.
[02:05:18.424 --> 02:05:19.565]  That's a sad reality.
[02:05:19.965 --> 02:05:24.786]  Tedros, ladies and gentlemen, is Fauci on steroids.
[02:05:25.626 --> 02:05:35.668]  Tedros has already been identified by major news outlets as having failed to not only stop pandemics, but covering them up.
[02:05:36.423 --> 02:05:39.007]  Tedros has worked directly with the Chai Coms.
[02:05:39.608 --> 02:05:46.678]  And you're also hearing Bill Gates admire the response to walking down 400 million people in China.
[02:05:48.394 --> 02:05:52.357]  Admiring their ability to stop the spread of pandemics?
[02:05:52.936 --> 02:05:59.855]   You even have Dr. Oz saying that China's response to the pandemic is something that he agreed
[02:05:59.855 --> 02:06:02.376]  with because it stops the spread of disease.
[02:06:02.376 --> 02:06:04.216]  Absolutely, Pete.
[02:06:04.216 --> 02:06:07.615]  The globalist takeover is a model of China worldwide.
[02:06:07.615 --> 02:06:09.416]  Why do you think China is doing China lockdowns?
[02:06:09.416 --> 02:06:13.056]  I think it's to kill the US economy, clearly, as a pretext.
[02:06:13.056 --> 02:06:15.796]  It's all their coastal cities, their main industrial cities.
[02:06:15.796 --> 02:06:16.796]  What about Trump?
[02:06:16.796 --> 02:06:20.416]   I have a lot of listeners mad at me that I'm not on an anti-Trump jag.
[02:06:20.418 --> 02:06:21.921]  Look, I'm mad at Trump on a lot of stuff.
[02:06:21.941 --> 02:06:23.163]  He's not the president right now.
[02:06:23.184 --> 02:06:26.169]  And I'm just trying to stop the implosion of the country.
[02:06:26.209 --> 02:06:27.752]  But what is your view on Trump?
[02:06:27.772 --> 02:06:28.915]  What is your view on all this?
[02:06:29.915 --> 02:06:31.336]  Well, here's my thing.
[02:06:31.456 --> 02:06:36.318]  President Trump, just like every other elected official, needs to do what we tell him to do.
[02:06:36.338 --> 02:06:38.880]  And I think that President Trump has been very responsive.
[02:06:39.220 --> 02:06:44.222]  When he did the red flag laws, I launched a campaign to notify him and say, not just no, but heck no.
[02:06:44.722 --> 02:06:47.064]  We have an obligation to let President Trump know what's going on.
[02:06:47.084 --> 02:06:47.284]  That's key.
[02:06:47.364 --> 02:06:50.685]  When you get on his ass, when he's been misadvised, he does the right thing.
[02:06:51.006 --> 02:06:53.227]  That's why he makes his own decisions.
[02:06:53.527 --> 02:06:55.828]  He makes a lot of bad ones, a lot of good ones, but you're right.
[02:06:56.128 --> 02:06:59.410]  That's why I know he's his own person, because he's responsive.
[02:07:00.492 --> 02:07:03.933]  Peter Navarro, for instance, when he's in the Oval Office, he's not a yes man.
[02:07:03.973 --> 02:07:06.233]  He says, you need to fire this guy Fauci.
[02:07:06.933 --> 02:07:14.995]  Alex Jones says, what the heck are you doing with JD Vance to Skull and Bones Yale Law School?
[02:07:15.295 --> 02:07:16.515]  I mean, that's Mitt Romney 2.0.
[02:07:17.115 --> 02:07:18.555]  We need to let President Trump know that.
[02:07:18.795 --> 02:07:19.575]  He may not know.
[02:07:19.875 --> 02:07:26.657]  He may not know about how upset we are with some of the endorsement industrial complex decisions that are being made.
[02:07:26.697 --> 02:07:28.077]  He's got an entire team of people.
[02:07:28.117 --> 02:07:29.117]  So what do we do?
[02:07:29.838 --> 02:07:31.280]  Get on Truth Social, let them know.
[02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:37.811]  We need to express our, not our outrage, we need to basically penetrate these circles that they have around them.
[02:07:38.111 --> 02:07:43.140]  They've got these deep... That's what Schwab says, the globalists penetrate, the people need to penetrate government.
[02:07:44.501 --> 02:07:45.022]  Absolutely.
[02:07:45.082 --> 02:07:47.984]  So, President Trump has been responsive to We The People.
[02:07:48.004 --> 02:07:49.785]  That's why I love him so much and I won't back down.
[02:07:49.805 --> 02:07:52.286]  But never will I be a yes man to him.
[02:07:52.607 --> 02:07:55.949]  What is happening right now, I believe President Trump needs to know about.
[02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:58.611]  And he pulled out of the WHO.
[02:07:58.631 --> 02:07:59.992]  No, you're right.
[02:08:00.012 --> 02:08:02.373]  He did 90% good, it was 10% bad, and I agree.
[02:08:03.074 --> 02:08:07.076]  That's why my gut tells me still back Trump overall, but be a strong critic when he's wrong.
[02:08:07.397 --> 02:08:08.958]  Pete Santilli, amazing job.
[02:08:09.258 --> 02:08:10.639]  ThePeteSantilliShow.com.
[02:08:10.879 --> 02:08:12.260]  Thank you so much, sir, for your amazing work.
[02:08:13.419 --> 02:08:14.060]  Thank you, sir.
[02:08:14.200 --> 02:08:15.741]  I appreciate having me on.
[02:08:15.761 --> 02:08:20.226]  Don't you dare replicate that on Infowars.com and let's spread the word.
[02:08:20.566 --> 02:08:21.047]  Absolutely.
[02:08:21.708 --> 02:08:22.308]  All right, folks.
[02:08:24.731 --> 02:08:26.212]  Really bad allergies in Austin right now.
[02:08:27.253 --> 02:08:33.880]  I went for a jog, if you can call it that, looking at a gorilla running down the road this morning, and there's just pollen everywhere, so I coated my logs.
[02:08:35.493 --> 02:08:37.455]  I'm having an issue with it right now, but we're going to be alright.
[02:08:37.475 --> 02:08:38.956]  I'm going to come back as I promised.
[02:08:39.016 --> 02:08:41.797]  Brian and Jeff, you're both going to get two and a half minutes on the other side.
[02:08:41.817 --> 02:08:42.758]  You've been holding patiently.
[02:08:43.198 --> 02:08:45.280]  I'm going to finish up with you ahead of Kate Daly taking over.
[02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:52.620]   Please don't forget, all the way we stay on air is infowars.com/show, you sharing those
[02:08:52.620 --> 02:08:57.940]   links and you going to infowarsstore.com and getting great products at the same time.
[02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:02.820]   X2 just got in two weeks ago, it's already 80% sold out, got a limited run, it's still
[02:09:02.820 --> 02:09:08.419]   25% off your X2, selling out infowarsstore.com and so many other great products and we're
[02:09:08.419 --> 02:09:09.419]  selling out of all the t-shirts.
[02:09:09.648 --> 02:09:10.429]  They're all in an edition.
[02:09:10.449 --> 02:09:11.770]  We'll never put the t-shirts again.
[02:09:12.030 --> 02:09:13.131]  They're all being sold at cost.
[02:09:13.211 --> 02:09:14.012]  Infowarrestore.com.
[02:09:14.132 --> 02:09:21.439]  All right, jamming in two final phone calls here on the Alex Jones Show before we go to our guest host, Kate Daly, always knocking it out of the park.
[02:09:21.519 --> 02:09:23.140]  Huge guest, you name it, amazing lady.
[02:09:23.921 --> 02:09:25.002]  Who's been home the longest here?
[02:09:25.022 --> 02:09:27.924]  That'd be Jeff in Ontario, Canada, then Brian in Ohio.
[02:09:28.385 --> 02:09:29.686]  Jeff, go ahead and knock it out of the park.
[02:09:31.112 --> 02:09:32.613]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:09:33.293 --> 02:09:41.198]  I wanted to talk about one thing in particular, and that is a mini-documentary by the infamous, or famous, Lyndon LaRouche.
[02:09:41.459 --> 02:09:45.881]  Another one that one of the patriots, we could stand on his back.
[02:09:46.902 --> 02:09:52.286]  I disagree with some of LaRouche's solutions, but when it came to knowing how things work, dead on.
[02:09:53.406 --> 02:10:07.439]   Yeah, he did a documentary a while ago called Unsurvivable, what nuclear war would look like, and that leads me to talk about Plague, famine, and war, and that's basically how they take over civilizations through all of history in battle, right?
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:18.872]  William Engdahl wrote a book called Full Spectrum Dominance, and so basically, the plague is the COVID, famine, we're seeing famine coming up, and the war is World War III, right?
[02:10:18.892 --> 02:10:21.295]  Dollar devaluation imploding borders.
[02:10:22.779 --> 02:10:36.724]  Yeah, and so the other ones that I wanted to talk about were Dr. Stan Monteith, Fritz Springmeier, Steve Quayle, Anthony Sutton, Daniel Estelin, Bob Chapman, John Coleman, Jim Mars, Aaron Russo, and Eustace Mullins.
[02:10:37.064 --> 02:10:39.025]  But I have an idea... Don't forget to text Mars!
[02:10:39.970 --> 02:10:40.610]  Absolutely.
[02:10:41.170 --> 02:10:45.011]  So the new t-shirt, fundraising t-shirt, the Alex Jones was right.
[02:10:45.051 --> 02:10:50.952]  Maybe on the back you could put like a concert t-shirt and list all of the people who have been 100% dead on.
[02:10:50.992 --> 02:10:53.693]  You could go back over all their work and look at what they've done.
[02:10:53.713 --> 02:10:55.193]  That is a gorgeous idea.
[02:10:56.553 --> 02:10:59.934]  By the way, we've got Ted Gunderson's, no not, I'm trying to get his family on.
[02:11:00.214 --> 02:11:03.535]  We've got General Ben K. Parton's grandson coming on Thursday.
[02:11:05.155 --> 02:11:05.435]  Awesome.
[02:11:05.891 --> 02:11:12.373]  So, my dad tried to tell me in 1990, showed me a documentary film by J.R.R.
[02:11:12.413 --> 02:11:17.094]  Church called What in the New World Order, showed me the Earth Summit in 1992.
[02:11:17.414 --> 02:11:18.134]  I didn't believe him.
[02:11:18.194 --> 02:11:23.656]  It was your film in 2007, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, that woke me up.
[02:11:24.036 --> 02:11:27.857]  And I have been trying to wake up my friends and family for 15 years.
[02:11:28.657 --> 02:11:30.018]  And it's been a battle.
[02:11:30.118 --> 02:11:33.078]  But my suggestion for everybody is get ready.
[02:11:33.178 --> 02:11:34.299]  Famine is what is next.
[02:11:35.620 --> 02:11:39.321]  And I believe war is the final one on the agenda.
[02:11:39.481 --> 02:11:39.961]  You're right.
[02:11:39.981 --> 02:11:43.042]  Global destabilization is here to bring in one world government, Jeff.
[02:11:46.303 --> 02:11:56.185]  I just wanted to ask you one more question about a book called The Perestroika Deception by Anatoly Galitsin, and that plays into the World War III.
[02:11:56.665 --> 02:12:01.327]  I've read the book, and it deals with the Perestroika Deception only being one part of it, yeah.
[02:12:03.717 --> 02:12:04.277]  Thank you, Jeff.
[02:12:04.777 --> 02:12:05.798]  Brian in Ohio.
[02:12:05.858 --> 02:12:07.338]  Last call before Kate Daly takes over.
[02:12:07.398 --> 02:12:07.679]  Go ahead.
[02:12:08.859 --> 02:12:09.319]  Yeah, man.
[02:12:09.519 --> 02:12:12.360]  First of all, man, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:12:13.361 --> 02:12:14.701]  I've been following you for years.
[02:12:15.502 --> 02:12:20.223]  I followed you back when you was on Conspiracy Theory with Desaventure.
[02:12:21.244 --> 02:12:27.346]  I know that you back in 2008, 2009, you even knew about the virus coming, pandemic, all that.
[02:12:27.406 --> 02:12:29.567]  You know what I mean?
[02:12:29.627 --> 02:12:31.588]  I just, you know, I support you.
[02:12:31.608 --> 02:12:32.448]  I support the cause.
[02:12:34.201 --> 02:12:35.362]  I'm censored like you.
[02:12:35.382 --> 02:12:38.443]  I threw my hat in the race for 2024.
[02:12:39.843 --> 02:12:44.464]  And, you know, I'll tell you, I want to I want to go back real quick and go back with the guys.
[02:12:44.544 --> 02:12:46.865]  It's about you got evil about Trump and all that.
[02:12:47.285 --> 02:12:49.746]  I don't know if you realize that on January 6th, I was there.
[02:12:50.246 --> 02:12:53.307]  You know, Donald Trump couldn't he couldn't stop anything.
[02:12:53.787 --> 02:12:57.348]  They shut down all the telephones.
[02:12:58.958 --> 02:13:03.061]  If Donald Trump was to tweet something out there, nobody would have got it anyway.
[02:13:03.621 --> 02:13:05.402]  Phones were just, they didn't work.
[02:13:05.902 --> 02:13:06.402]  They didn't work.
[02:13:06.422 --> 02:13:07.963]  So let's get that one thing out of the way.
[02:13:08.383 --> 02:13:16.387]  And I just want to say, you know, that we got to realize that they broke all the constitutional laws throughout these states in this election.
[02:13:16.667 --> 02:13:17.808]  They broke the Constitution.
[02:13:17.828 --> 02:13:19.229]  They keep breaking the Constitution.
[02:13:19.529 --> 02:13:21.770]  This administration has continued.
[02:13:22.090 --> 02:13:25.152]  Now they're doing it in front of our face.
[02:13:25.212 --> 02:13:27.493]  They are running the country in the ground in front of us.
[02:13:28.226 --> 02:13:29.748]  Here's the problem that I have.
[02:13:30.148 --> 02:13:32.671]  There's 545 people in Washington.
[02:13:32.832 --> 02:13:40.711]   And when are we, the people, going to stop letting 545 people dictate what 350 plus million
[02:13:40.711 --> 02:13:42.472]  people do in this country?
[02:13:42.472 --> 02:13:44.332]  Well, brother, it's an information war.
[02:13:44.332 --> 02:13:45.511]  We got to free the hearts and minds.
[02:13:45.511 --> 02:13:46.511]  Thanks for the call.
[02:13:46.511 --> 02:13:47.511]  Thanks for holding.
[02:13:48.490 --> 02:13:51.313]  Thank you all for your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support.
[02:13:51.613 --> 02:13:55.137]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com right now to get great t-shirts, books, films.
[02:13:55.458 --> 02:13:56.339]  That's how you keep us on air.
[02:13:56.379 --> 02:13:57.200]  It's so critical.
[02:13:57.220 --> 02:13:58.962]  I want to thank you all who have been supporting.
[02:13:58.981 --> 02:14:04.021]  There's also a big donate button right at the top at Infowarshore.com.
[02:14:04.021 --> 02:14:05.582]  Thank you so much for all your support.
[02:14:05.582 --> 02:14:06.981]  Kate Daly takes over.
[02:14:06.981 --> 02:14:08.740]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:14:08.745 --> 02:14:10.166]  So glad to be here today.
[02:14:10.347 --> 02:14:14.770]  I'm your guest host, Kate Dally, from the Kate Dally Show at katedallyradio.com.
[02:14:14.810 --> 02:14:15.851]  Make sure and get iodine.
[02:14:15.891 --> 02:14:19.754]  Make sure and get some of these products that Alex is talking about and get them in bulk.
[02:14:20.095 --> 02:14:20.435]  You know what?
[02:14:20.555 --> 02:14:20.995]  They'll keep.
[02:14:21.256 --> 02:14:22.997]  They'll keep on the shelf because they're high quality.
[02:14:23.357 --> 02:14:23.918]  I'm telling you.
[02:14:24.651 --> 02:14:25.633]  Make sure you have stuff.
[02:14:26.113 --> 02:14:26.794]  Get it right now.
[02:14:27.255 --> 02:14:28.477]  It's really, really important.
[02:14:28.737 --> 02:14:30.680]  I've got such an amazing guest for you today.
[02:14:31.081 --> 02:14:34.425]  I also want to mention before we go there, 2,000 Mules is out.
[02:14:35.046 --> 02:14:35.767]  This is the movie.
[02:14:35.787 --> 02:14:39.433]  You have to go there to get the tickets or see it virtually online, you know, see it online.
[02:14:39.933 --> 02:14:48.316]  But 2,000 mules is out, and election fraud is a, that and food shortages are two of our most pressing situations here in America right now.
[02:14:48.476 --> 02:14:55.939]  Even though the distractions are huge, and they want our attention going other directions, these are the most important things.
[02:14:56.259 --> 02:15:00.121]  We have to preserve our elections, free and fair elections.
[02:15:00.301 --> 02:15:01.461]  And so, you know what I would love?
[02:15:01.541 --> 02:15:06.743]  I would love it if everybody wore who they were voting for in a t-shirt and big black bold ink.
[02:15:06.863 --> 02:15:11.368]   Those are the pictures that need to hit Social media, there's no denying that.
[02:15:11.488 --> 02:15:20.478]  If everybody was bold enough and willing enough to do it, you could never ever slide by with the amount of election fraud that they love to be able to perpetrate on our elections.
[02:15:20.498 --> 02:15:25.164]  They can do about 35%, 40% election fraud if they can get the people to buy it.
[02:15:25.684 --> 02:15:29.626]  And so this brings us to the issue today with my very fantastic guest.
[02:15:29.746 --> 02:15:30.847]  I love Chrisanne Hall.
[02:15:30.887 --> 02:15:34.489]  Chrisanne Hall is our constitutional attorney and expert.
[02:15:34.569 --> 02:15:36.750]  She's amazing and a good friend of mine.
[02:15:37.071 --> 02:15:38.992]  She's on my show weekly and I absolutely love her.
[02:15:39.052 --> 02:15:39.752]  She's a veteran.
[02:15:39.792 --> 02:15:40.773]  She's a public speaker.
[02:15:40.833 --> 02:15:42.854]  She's been on about every TV show you can imagine.
[02:15:43.454 --> 02:15:49.476]  And she knows her stuff, and she does it in the only fireball way she knows how, and that is that delivery that is amazing.
[02:15:49.776 --> 02:15:59.940]  She even instructs sheriffs all over the country, which I absolutely love, because they need to know what to do and how to preserve the Constitution that they swear an oath to.
[02:16:00.320 --> 02:16:10.363]  So I love that she's going around and telling them, please, please, please, this is what your job means, because that role, we're going to see how important that role is in our lives coming up.
[02:16:10.623 --> 02:16:12.284]  Chrisanne Hall, welcome to the program.
[02:16:12.304 --> 02:16:12.644]  How are you?
[02:16:13.703 --> 02:16:14.524]  Well, thank you, Kate.
[02:16:14.544 --> 02:16:15.486]  So glad to be here.
[02:16:15.546 --> 02:16:19.652]  So glad to be a constitutional attorney that actually understands the Constitution.
[02:16:21.175 --> 02:16:24.860]  And I want to thank you for bringing me on because I love being with you no matter where you are.
[02:16:26.431 --> 02:16:27.252]  Well, it's rare.
[02:16:27.352 --> 02:16:30.135]  It is very rare and this is why I have you on my show every week.
[02:16:30.155 --> 02:16:34.780]  This is why I love you and invited you here because I'm telling you, you've got to hear Chrisanne on this issue.
[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:38.243]  So the big issue of the week is the Supreme Court.
[02:16:38.603 --> 02:16:43.889]  I hate that we have to call them the Supreme, but it's the Supreme Court of the United States and what is going on.
[02:16:44.449 --> 02:16:50.230]  So, tell us and bring this issue down for us and make the most logical sense of this issue, because I know you will.
[02:16:50.830 --> 02:16:57.972]  Tell us what your take on this is, and if you're living under a rock and you don't know, maybe we need a little refresher course in what just happened.
[02:16:59.191 --> 02:17:04.110]   Well, what just happened was someone in the Supreme Court system
[02:17:04.110 --> 02:17:08.550]   leaked a draft opinion from the majority court written by
[02:17:08.550 --> 02:17:09.811]  Justice Alito.
[02:17:09.811 --> 02:17:14.050]   This is something that is completely unprecedented, and
[02:17:14.050 --> 02:17:16.291]  I call it judicial terrorism.
[02:17:16.291 --> 02:17:22.191]   There is no other purpose than to leak this draft opinion than to
[02:17:22.191 --> 02:17:28.070]   wreak havoc and chaos across the country to create a political
[02:17:28.070 --> 02:17:32.151]  create a political shockwave.
[02:17:32.109 --> 02:17:40.814]   I believe not just simply to put pressure on the Supreme Court, because frankly, Putting pressure on the Supreme Court at this point is really moot.
[02:17:40.874 --> 02:17:42.315]  They're not going to change this.
[02:17:42.816 --> 02:17:45.858]  The Supreme Court is not going to change their vote.
[02:17:45.878 --> 02:17:47.819]  They're not going to change this opinion.
[02:17:48.339 --> 02:17:56.345]  If they did that, it would completely invalidate the judiciary and its authority and the validity of its opinions.
[02:17:56.785 --> 02:18:06.652]  So there's no way all of this, you know, these protesters and all the lunacy that's happening outside of the Supreme Court is going to have any effect on this opinion whatsoever.
[02:18:07.672 --> 02:18:17.175]  It may put some fear inside the minds of the people who work there and the Supreme Court justices, but it's not going to change this opinion.
[02:18:18.616 --> 02:18:29.980]  What the purpose of this is, is political terrorism from the judicial perspective to send shockwaves across the country to make an influence on the midterm elections.
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:33.381]  I don't even see it lasting that long.
[02:18:34.258 --> 02:18:47.149]  The people who are outside protesting the Supreme Court, the people who get all worked up about these kind of things from a leftist perspective, also have a tendency to have a very short attention span.
[02:18:47.670 --> 02:18:52.774]  So I think they played this hand too early, and people are going to forget.
[02:18:52.894 --> 02:19:04.560]   And by the way, by the time October comes, by the time November comes, People will realize the reality of what this opinion does.
[02:19:05.201 --> 02:19:15.468]  And all of what I call the screaming memes and all of the hysteria out there is not an accurate reflection of what's really going to happen with this opinion.
[02:19:16.897 --> 02:19:17.117]  Right.
[02:19:17.377 --> 02:19:27.707]  And in the news, we're told, in the scripted news, what we're told is that this will return this Roe vs. Wade to the states.
[02:19:27.827 --> 02:19:31.430]  Now, that is one of the biggest lies ever, and why is that?
[02:19:32.779 --> 02:19:40.161]  Well, I think the hysteria that I'm seeing is that this will outlaw abortion, okay?
[02:19:40.541 --> 02:19:50.763]  So it's not going to outlaw abortion in any way, because number one, abortion was never quote-unquote legalized.
[02:19:51.404 --> 02:19:56.945]  What the Supreme Court did, in what Alito's opinion does, is a very amazing thing.
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:09.910]  Number one, it points out a very important constitutional fact that both Roe and Casey were not constitutionally sound opinions.
[02:20:10.310 --> 02:20:12.852]  They were politically active opinions.
[02:20:12.912 --> 02:20:17.836]  These were written by political activist judges who were not following the Constitution.
[02:20:18.737 --> 02:20:26.904]  The federal government was never delegated any authority to involve themselves in this matter.
[02:20:27.404 --> 02:20:33.186]  This is a dispute between a person and their state.
[02:20:33.586 --> 02:20:40.487]  Those jurisdictional matters are specifically excluded in Article 3 from federal jurisdiction.
[02:20:41.408 --> 02:20:46.709]  Secondly, the 14th Amendment has been used since its incorporation.
[02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:55.831]  To bring power into the federal government by creating rights that are not enumerated in the Bill of Rights.
[02:20:55.891 --> 02:20:59.872]  Now, there are many rights that are not enumerated in the Bill of Rights.
[02:20:59.972 --> 02:21:02.453]  That's what the Ninth Amendment is all about.
[02:21:03.093 --> 02:21:33.189]   But, in order for the courts and the federal government to recognize that there is a right that is not enumerated, for all of our judicial history, it has been That the courts must recognize a long-standing historical recognition, a long-standing cultural recognition, that this particular thing is an inherent natural right in order for it to be a constitutional right.
[02:21:33.689 --> 02:21:37.330]  For example, parental rights, okay?
[02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:53.201]   So parental rights are recognized as being inherent, natural, constitutionally protected rights Of the people, because since people started having families, parental rights have always been regarded as an inherent right.
[02:21:53.981 --> 02:22:06.084]  Now, what they did wrong in Roe, what they did wrong in Casey, was claim that there is a right to abortion even though it's not mentioned in the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:06.545 --> 02:22:21.682]   Well, in order for that to be true, You would have to have a long-standing legal, historical, and cultural recognition of abortion being a right in order to use the 14th Amendment to bring that into constitutional protection.
[02:22:22.182 --> 02:22:27.365]  However, there is no such long-standing recognition of abortion being a right.
[02:22:27.725 --> 02:22:39.360]   So as Alito points out, there is no No pathway through the 14th Amendment for abortion to be established as a constitutionally protected right.
[02:22:40.101 --> 02:22:44.202]  And so what Alito has done is said, this is not a federal issue.
[02:22:44.642 --> 02:22:48.423]  You cannot use the 14th Amendment to make this a federal issue.
[02:22:48.883 --> 02:22:56.846]  This is a state issue because the powers not delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states.
[02:22:57.566 --> 02:23:21.581]   But even so, Kate, even so, I have written an article called The Inalienable Right to Life, where we review what we just mentioned, the historical, the social, the cultural, the legal precedent of generations that shows even though this is politically and legally a state matter,
[02:23:22.463 --> 02:23:26.127]  A state has been established to preserve rights.
[02:23:26.207 --> 02:23:34.755]  The single purpose to create government, as outlined in our Declaration of Independence, is to secure rights.
[02:23:34.976 --> 02:23:39.280]  Which means at the state level, abortion should not even be legalized.
[02:23:40.333 --> 02:23:40.573]  Right.
[02:23:40.814 --> 02:23:43.216]  So all the news is saying they're going to return it to the states.
[02:23:43.297 --> 02:23:44.858]  It's already in the states.
[02:23:44.938 --> 02:23:46.340]  It's never been a federal law.
[02:23:46.380 --> 02:23:48.583]  It was only an opinion on a Texas case.
[02:23:49.003 --> 02:23:50.185]  This is where we're lied to.
[02:23:50.225 --> 02:23:50.725]  I love you.
[02:23:51.146 --> 02:23:52.808]  We'll be right back in just a moment.
[02:23:53.108 --> 02:23:54.950]  We'll talk about all of this in just a moment.
[02:23:54.970 --> 02:23:55.571]  We'll be right back.
[02:23:55.931 --> 02:23:58.394]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:58.594 --> 02:23:59.115]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:23:59.793 --> 02:24:01.313]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:01.353 --> 02:24:02.634]  So glad you're tuning in today.
[02:24:02.854 --> 02:24:03.754]  I'm happy to be here.
[02:24:03.934 --> 02:24:05.254]  I'm Kate Daly, your guest host.
[02:24:05.394 --> 02:24:09.695]  My guest is Chrisanne Hall, the constitutional expert and attorney, and now you know why I love her.
[02:24:10.215 --> 02:24:17.237]  She likes to dial down the Constitution to really understand what's going on here with Roe vs. Wade.
[02:24:17.557 --> 02:24:22.098]  And I'll talk about what I think this distraction is and why it came up right now.
[02:24:22.478 --> 02:24:23.179]  We'll get to that.
[02:24:23.459 --> 02:24:29.120]  But I want to stay on this for just a moment because what you're clarifying are the points that everybody needs to know in America.
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:32.543]  Because the news is telling everybody something very false.
[02:24:32.923 --> 02:24:39.469]  And that is the idea that Roe vs. Wade is a federal issue, and it never has been a federal law.
[02:24:39.930 --> 02:24:41.671]  And this is a state's issue.
[02:24:41.911 --> 02:24:42.792]  Always has been.
[02:24:42.832 --> 02:24:51.600]  The states could have done anything they wanted to do with this, but they're so weak that they hide behind the fact that everybody thinks that the Supreme Court can make federal law.
[02:24:51.640 --> 02:24:52.161]  They cannot.
[02:24:53.542 --> 02:24:54.522]  Right, absolutely.
[02:24:54.542 --> 02:25:04.886]  And now you have all of these people running around talking about how they're taking away Roe v. Wade as, you know, the law of the land.
[02:25:04.906 --> 02:25:07.947]  Roe v. Wade was never the law of the land.
[02:25:07.967 --> 02:25:10.968]  Roe v. Wade was a Supreme Court opinion.
[02:25:10.988 --> 02:25:13.769]  The judiciary does not make law.
[02:25:14.110 --> 02:25:16.791]  Lawmaking is reserved to the legislative branch.
[02:25:18.635 --> 02:25:33.658]  And what's interesting is now I'm seeing people, you know, the leftist politicians saying, oh, well now that the Supreme Court has turned its back on Roe v. Wade, now we're gonna have to have Congress do this.
[02:25:34.138 --> 02:25:36.519]  Well, no, it's not a federal issue.
[02:25:36.539 --> 02:25:38.419]  It has always been a state issue.
[02:25:38.879 --> 02:25:46.361]  It can't be a federal issue because, and that's one of the things that Alito addresses in this particular opinion.
[02:25:46.961 --> 02:25:55.663]  You cannot lawfully use the 14th Amendment to bring abortion into the federal jurisdiction.
[02:25:56.223 --> 02:26:06.505]  And so if you can't use the 14th Amendment to bring abortion into the federal jurisdiction, then Congress cannot create a law regarding abortion.
[02:26:06.826 --> 02:26:09.446]  It has to be done at the state level.
[02:26:09.866 --> 02:26:13.227]  And so this opinion is not outlawing abortion.
[02:26:14.053 --> 02:26:24.017]  It's just recognizing that abortion is an issue that should be handled by the people through their states, period.
[02:26:24.517 --> 02:26:33.601]  So if you want to live in a state that wants to justify abortion, then you need to influence your legislators to do so.
[02:26:33.701 --> 02:26:40.764]  If you don't want to live in a state that justifies abortion, then you need to influence your legislators to do so.
[02:26:41.064 --> 02:26:42.505]  But you know what's interesting, Kate?
[02:26:43.536 --> 02:27:03.949]  I think one of the most interesting things that's going to come out of this is, where are the states, the red states, who have been hemming and hawing on legislation to protect rights because, well, you know, the Supreme Court said that Roe v. Wade says, and they've been using this as an excuse.
[02:27:04.509 --> 02:27:10.813]  When this opinion comes out, what are they going to use as an excuse to not absolutely and completely protect life?
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:13.300]  Absolutely.
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:26.245]  Even legislators in my own state put it out there as, yes, we are striving to protect pro-life, except we're only going to hinge that if Roe versus Wade is overturned.
[02:27:26.305 --> 02:27:34.268]  I mean, it's this kind of ignorance and misunderstanding and cowardice that comes from the red states in standing up for life.
[02:27:34.729 --> 02:27:39.660]  Lives, any life has that constitutional protection, shouldn't it?
[02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:40.742]  To live!
[02:27:40.762 --> 02:27:42.586]  To pursue happiness!
[02:27:43.519 --> 02:27:51.681]  And when you terminate somebody else's life, when you murder that baby, you are murdering the other person's right to live out their existence.
[02:27:51.961 --> 02:27:54.202]  I'm so vehemently against abortion, can you tell?
[02:27:54.802 --> 02:27:59.623]  And so, this is an interesting timing as well.
[02:27:59.743 --> 02:28:06.005]  Six months before, I remember Obama, six months before the whole Bin Laden thing came out and then they shoved him in the ocean.
[02:28:06.525 --> 02:28:06.765]  Mm-hmm.
[02:28:07.266 --> 02:28:08.947]  Anyway, he needs brownie points.
[02:28:09.147 --> 02:28:13.469]  And so is this the distraction to get the left a rallying cry?
[02:28:13.509 --> 02:28:20.654]  Because it is hard to vote against yourself when you're paying the same gas price as we are, and you're doing the same, have the same grocery bill.
[02:28:21.094 --> 02:28:24.916]  And so how do you get the left to go out and vote, right?
[02:28:25.016 --> 02:28:26.897]  And so is this their rallying cry?
[02:28:26.937 --> 02:28:30.640]  Are they using this first draft leaked document to do that?
[02:28:31.780 --> 02:28:34.462]  No, well, that's what they're using, Kate.
[02:28:35.285 --> 02:28:37.350]  But I don't see that it's going to be successful.
[02:28:37.911 --> 02:28:42.139]  I think this is a wasted effort on their part.
[02:28:42.240 --> 02:28:46.669]  First off, we're too far away from the midterms to actually really make a difference.
[02:28:47.228 --> 02:28:57.517]  Secondly, between now and the midterms, the people are going to realize that this opinion, and really, what does overturning Roe v. Wade actually mean?
[02:28:57.857 --> 02:29:01.600]  The whole rhetoric now, overturning Roe v. Wade, overturning Roe v. Wade.
[02:29:02.421 --> 02:29:10.628]  Most people think overturning Roe v. Wade is what the media is screaming about, about how abortion will never be allowed in America again.
[02:29:11.008 --> 02:29:15.010]  That's not what overturning Roe v. Wade means.
[02:29:15.170 --> 02:29:19.471]  It just means it's going to be shifted to the states to make their decisions.
[02:29:20.212 --> 02:29:22.633]  And I am a pro-life person.
[02:29:22.693 --> 02:29:30.096]  I'm actually a pro-adoption person, which is actually the answer to the argument, not the argument.
[02:29:30.776 --> 02:29:35.858]  We should be more proactive for adoption, which gives solutions rather than just arguments.
[02:29:36.533 --> 02:29:53.032]   But nonetheless, if we're talking about this from a constitutional or legal perspective, Overturning Roe v. Wade doesn't really mean much of anything at all if you live in a state that has pro-abortion legislation.
[02:29:53.633 --> 02:30:00.936]  And the idea that, you know, I think Rachel Maddow went on a rant about, you know, back alley abortions again.
[02:30:01.696 --> 02:30:15.347]   I'm sorry that Rachel Maddow still lives in the 18th century, but the reality is technology, medicine, we have A birth control that is reliable now.
[02:30:16.249 --> 02:30:21.357]  This pro-choice argument is not really an argument anymore.
[02:30:21.417 --> 02:30:22.519]  It's just an excuse.
[02:30:24.457 --> 02:30:25.218]  Absolutely.
[02:30:25.238 --> 02:30:26.519]  It is an excuse.
[02:30:26.579 --> 02:30:31.882]  It's an excuse to get out of consequences of what you know might happen if you have sex.
[02:30:32.063 --> 02:30:33.804]  I mean, then don't have sex.
[02:30:33.824 --> 02:30:37.707]  This is a really easy thing, but people out there have a hard time understanding that.
[02:30:38.047 --> 02:30:43.951]  So they're running around saying that women have a protected constitutional right to go murder somebody.
[02:30:44.291 --> 02:30:46.393]  I'm sorry, but the line stops at murder.
[02:30:46.793 --> 02:30:48.816]  You don't have that freedom to murder.
[02:30:48.877 --> 02:30:52.622]  You have a lot of freedom, but not a freedom to just go murder whoever you want.
[02:30:52.763 --> 02:31:01.677]  And that's where the line gets a little fuzzy for these pro-choice people who think the choice is, I can do anything I want to do and there are no consequences to it.
[02:31:02.731 --> 02:31:03.171]  Very strange.
[02:31:03.192 --> 02:31:07.556]  Right, well, I mean, there's lots of arguments to be made from a scientific perspective.
[02:31:07.816 --> 02:31:10.399]  I mean, my undergraduate degree is in biochemistry.
[02:31:10.459 --> 02:31:21.650]  We could talk about the failed scientific arguments in Roe v. Wade all day long, and in Casey, we could talk about the, you know, the false narratives all day long.
[02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:25.654]  The bottom line is this from a legal and constitutional perspective.
[02:31:26.178 --> 02:31:34.020]  This opinion actually recognizes, as we mentioned before, where this issue has always rested.
[02:31:34.040 --> 02:31:50.565]  And the fact that states have refused to go forward with the legislation that the people they represent wanted because of some Supreme Court opinion shows us how out of whack we are on the understanding of the proper role of government.
[02:31:54.591 --> 02:31:55.872]  Amen to Chris Anne Hall!
[02:31:56.272 --> 02:31:57.853]  LibertyFirstSociety.com.
[02:31:57.873 --> 02:32:00.275]  We're going to come back and talk a little bit about Ministry of Truth.
[02:32:00.975 --> 02:32:01.355]  Wow!
[02:32:02.276 --> 02:32:03.577]  What a statement that is!
[02:32:03.917 --> 02:32:05.478]  We're going to come right back and talk about that.
[02:32:05.818 --> 02:32:06.859]  And here's the deal, too.
[02:32:07.219 --> 02:32:11.362]  If you have to murder it, if you have to end its life, that means it's living.
[02:32:12.302 --> 02:32:12.643]  The end.
[02:32:12.943 --> 02:32:13.143]  Right.
[02:32:13.383 --> 02:32:16.065]  If you have to stop it from living, it's living.
[02:32:16.713 --> 02:32:22.677]  So, and if we're going to search and spend billions of dollars to find a shred of life on Mars, give me a break.
[02:32:23.337 --> 02:32:25.638]  We can't find one in the womb, there's a problem there.
[02:32:25.999 --> 02:32:32.823]  So you can tell, I'm not, I'm vehemently against abortion in every way and form.
[02:32:33.283 --> 02:32:35.504]  And let me just tell you, we'll be right back with Chris Anne Hall.
[02:32:35.544 --> 02:32:37.906]  We have so much to talk about on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:37.946 --> 02:32:38.466]  Be right back.
[02:32:39.233 --> 02:32:43.076]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show, and I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[02:32:43.156 --> 02:32:48.900]  My guest is the great Chrisanne Hall, constitutional expert and attorney at LibertyFirstSociety.com.
[02:32:48.920 --> 02:32:52.103]  If you really want to get educated on the Constitution, that's the place to go.
[02:32:52.463 --> 02:33:00.970]  She's got wonderful courses and easy-to-read articles, all kinds of things there that you can check out and really get an education on this, because this is what we're lacking.
[02:33:01.310 --> 02:33:03.471]  You know, there's several things I keep hearing in the press.
[02:33:03.852 --> 02:33:16.659]   Number one, landmark case, as if How dare you nudge or re-examine or re-look at this landmark case, when really we should be saying very political-driven case.
[02:33:17.180 --> 02:33:23.526]  And documents were leaked on that one too, July 4th, 1972, right before that decision came out.
[02:33:23.806 --> 02:33:28.771]  Not the opinions, but other documents were leaked as well, and they think it came from one of the justices.
[02:33:29.151 --> 02:33:32.754]  And here's the other thing, the inalienable right to life.
[02:33:32.854 --> 02:33:41.501]  The left always talks about the woman, never the baby, and those on the right, we talk about the baby as being a separate entity.
[02:33:41.861 --> 02:33:57.622]   It is really amazing that the emotionally charged Roe vs. Wade, 50 years later on its 50th anniversary, is now coming to an emotionally charged head before the midterms for the left.
[02:33:57.722 --> 02:34:05.067]  Even putting barbed wire around the White House in a very dramatic, dramatic expression once again, you know?
[02:34:05.527 --> 02:34:08.509]  And so, what are your thoughts on some of the things I just talked about?
[02:34:08.529 --> 02:34:13.952]  The inalienable right to life, and also the landmark case that we keep hearing about.
[02:34:15.290 --> 02:34:24.937]  You know, Kate, when they discover and they need to discover how this draft opinion was leaked, someone needs to be swiftly and summarily fired.
[02:34:25.757 --> 02:34:33.603]  If that person in the Supreme Court staff happens to be an attorney, that attorney not only needs to be swiftly and summarily fired, they need to be disbarred.
[02:34:34.423 --> 02:34:50.292]   And if it is discovered that a Supreme Court justice knew that this was happening, This would probably be the strongest case for impeaching a Supreme Court justice that we have ever seen.
[02:34:51.012 --> 02:35:00.269]   But what that takes, Kate, is going to take some people in Congress with real fortitude, real courage, To get to the bottom of this.
[02:35:00.349 --> 02:35:03.210]  Not to trust the FBI to do this investigation.
[02:35:03.230 --> 02:35:07.072]  I don't trust the FBI to investigate who took a cookie from my cookie jar.
[02:35:07.532 --> 02:35:14.155]  So, this is something that is going to have to be followed with perseverance, with dedication, and with due diligence.
[02:35:14.735 --> 02:35:17.536]  Something that you're not going to find in the FBI.
[02:35:18.337 --> 02:35:23.159]  The inalienable right to life is a given in America.
[02:35:23.877 --> 02:35:30.118]  I mean, the first foundational document of America published is the Declaration of Independence.
[02:35:30.885 --> 02:35:43.377]  And it reads, we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men, and they did mean all, red, yellow, black, and white, and they didn't mean just men, they meant humankind, so both genders, all colors.
[02:35:43.797 --> 02:35:54.467]  If you need to know why I'm telling you the facts about that, you need to go to libertyfirstsociety.com and take our classes and see what the founders actually said about it, not what your textbook says or the 1619 Project says.
[02:35:56.477 --> 02:36:02.944]  But, uh, we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.
[02:36:03.244 --> 02:36:04.806]  Among these, life.
[02:36:04.826 --> 02:36:07.729]  The very first one, life.
[02:36:08.690 --> 02:36:23.638]   And then the Declaration of Independence goes on to say that to secure these rights, to secure life, Governments are instituted among men deriving their just power from the consent of the governed, okay?
[02:36:23.918 --> 02:36:34.745]  The only reason government ever exists is to secure the inalienable, inherent rights of the people, first and foremost being the right to life.
[02:36:35.125 --> 02:36:45.512]  Because if you do not have an inherent, inalienable, indefeasible right to life, then you are not free, and you're a slave.
[02:36:47.409 --> 02:36:47.829]  Amen.
[02:36:48.149 --> 02:36:52.510]  You know, it crossed my mind when you were also talking about the leaking of that document.
[02:36:52.530 --> 02:36:58.292]  I wonder if that could be purposeful to be able to replace a judge and put them back in before midterm.
[02:36:58.312 --> 02:36:59.832]  That would be very interesting, wouldn't it?
[02:36:59.852 --> 02:37:01.633]  It would.
[02:37:01.673 --> 02:37:09.015]  I don't think we could get a new judge before midterm, but that would be something that would really... Now, that would be a crisis that would last a little bit longer.
[02:37:11.161 --> 02:37:11.801]  Absolutely.
[02:37:12.722 --> 02:37:15.284]  Let's talk a little bit about Ministry of Truth.
[02:37:15.524 --> 02:37:25.310]  I can't imagine I'm saying those words because it's pretty deplorable of King Frodelot and the administration, or really not even King Frodelot.
[02:37:25.350 --> 02:37:28.732]  I mean, he could barely utter a sentence, you know, just eat ice cream.
[02:37:29.372 --> 02:37:30.893]  It's who's running him.
[02:37:31.374 --> 02:37:35.965]   And so talk to me about Ministry of It's so funny to call it Ministry of Truth.
[02:37:35.985 --> 02:37:38.606]  It just reminds me of George Orwell or Eric Blair.
[02:37:39.746 --> 02:37:40.607]  The writings of 1984.
[02:37:42.368 --> 02:37:50.751]  Well, really, it's a Bureau of Disinformation and this actually began in, I mean, publicly began in March of 2021.
[02:37:52.742 --> 02:38:04.524]  When the House Communications and Technology Committee met to define and sort of pine over this whole disinformation thing.
[02:38:05.104 --> 02:38:09.505]  And the tagline was, disinformation is dangerous to our democracy.
[02:38:09.905 --> 02:38:18.207]  And then it wasn't shortly after that, we have now this executive agency coming forward, led by a complete leftist lunatic.
[02:38:18.974 --> 02:38:23.901]  And we, the people, have to really understand the history behind this.
[02:38:24.562 --> 02:38:30.110]  First off, most Americans don't really know this is not our first Ministry of Truth.
[02:38:31.146 --> 02:38:51.438]  We had an Office of War Information under Woodrow Wilson to get people to go to be encouraging America to go into World War I. And then under FDR, we had another Office of War Information to encourage people to get into World War II.
[02:38:52.218 --> 02:39:05.022]   Shortly after that, Congress passed a law called the Smith Modernization Act that outlawed the use of tax dollars of public funds for creating these kinds of organizations.
[02:39:05.563 --> 02:39:18.307]  And so since 1948, using tax dollars to create an office of information or an office of disinformation has been completely unconstitutional until 2012.
[02:39:20.157 --> 02:39:35.311]  When the Republicans in Congress passed a bill called the Smith-Munt Modernization Act that was buried in the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act.
[02:39:35.891 --> 02:39:50.539]   And the Smith-Munt Modernization Act, which was sponsored by a Republican named Thornberry out of Texas, actually undid, reversed the Smith-Munn Act, and then opened the
[02:39:50.539 --> 02:39:58.748]   floodgates for our tax dollars to be used to create what we're seeing today. If you do a
[02:39:58.748 --> 02:40:05.908]   little watching, a little research, you'll see that once this Smith-Munn Modernization Act was
[02:40:05.908 --> 02:40:10.489]   passed and signed into law, it was signed into law by Obama, but brought forward by a complete
[02:40:10.489 --> 02:40:16.949]   Republican majority. Now all of the sudden you are completely flooded throughout the news media
[02:40:16.949 --> 02:40:19.789]  with all this what we call now fake news.
[02:40:20.010 --> 02:40:28.293]  And now here we have another office of information, or as the Biden administration calls it, the disinformation.
[02:40:28.913 --> 02:40:45.179]  And it's all because we have completely, completely reversed the protections that were put in place to keep these kinds of government propagandas and manipulations to attack the American people.
[02:40:47.251 --> 02:40:48.172]  I'm with you on this.
[02:40:48.712 --> 02:40:56.876]  It was before the Smith-Munn Act, too, was the propaganda piece that they loved to throw out there was we could lie in foreign press.
[02:40:56.936 --> 02:40:58.357]  It was for other countries.
[02:40:59.097 --> 02:41:07.862]  And it was domestically, here we go, we can lie to our own citizens and never, ever cannot be, you know, illegal to do so.
[02:41:08.442 --> 02:41:13.465]  And so then if you watch from 2012, wow, have the floodgates really opened, like you said.
[02:41:13.485 --> 02:41:15.366]  It was a huge ripping of that Smith-Munn.
[02:41:15.386 --> 02:41:16.146]  And they're using our money, Kate.
[02:41:17.836 --> 02:41:18.856]  They're using our money.
[02:41:19.097 --> 02:41:32.910]  They're using our money that they take out of our paychecks, out of our pockets, to create propaganda that will be used to silence us.
[02:41:33.971 --> 02:41:38.515]  That will be used to punish us for our own thoughts and opinions.
[02:41:40.638 --> 02:42:02.072]  100%.
[02:41:40.698 --> 02:42:02.072]  And I do think this is why both parties are so intent on bipartisanship, on increasing the mental health in this country, to then classify how you think as a mental condition, just like that judge did to one of the January 6th, one of the women that was there, who just said into her camera, I think the BLM is wearing MAGA hats.
[02:42:02.392 --> 02:42:07.956]  And he said, I don't like your belief you're going to jail and pay $5,000 because your belief is horrendous to me.
[02:42:09.016 --> 02:42:10.717]  That it was more like a mental condition.
[02:42:11.057 --> 02:42:17.720]  I'll be right back with the fantastic, what could I say, Chrisanne Hall, constitutional expert and attorney.
[02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:18.580]  So stay with us.
[02:42:18.880 --> 02:42:20.641]  Back here with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:42:20.701 --> 02:42:22.142]  Terrific show today, Alex.
[02:42:23.482 --> 02:42:27.684]  And now we have, of course, the great Chrisanne Hall, who's our constitutional expert and attorney.
[02:42:27.704 --> 02:42:33.086]  She travels all around the country to deliver speeches to people, to educate, and also the sheriffs.
[02:42:33.106 --> 02:42:35.027]  And there's several things I want to talk about.
[02:42:35.888 --> 02:42:40.715]  Number one, I want you to mention the documentary that is so amazing.
[02:42:41.056 --> 02:42:47.265]  If you have not seen this, you need to see this and have your family and your children and your grandchildren see this.
[02:42:48.167 --> 02:42:50.230]  Chrisanne, talk about your documentary for just a moment.
[02:42:51.687 --> 02:42:52.207]  Absolutely.
[02:42:52.227 --> 02:42:55.009]  You know, we just talked about that ministry of truth.
[02:42:55.089 --> 02:43:04.475]  Well, Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, has stepped up and said, I will do everything in Florida to fight this disinformation bureau here.
[02:43:04.536 --> 02:43:05.896]  This is not going to come here.
[02:43:06.417 --> 02:43:12.000]  Well, why does Ron DeSantis, as the governor of Florida, have a duty and authority to do that?
[02:43:12.060 --> 02:43:14.182]  Well, that's what our documentary is all about.
[02:43:14.622 --> 02:43:16.323]  It's called Noncompliant.
[02:43:16.824 --> 02:43:20.126]  You can find it at noncompliantmovie.com.
[02:43:20.746 --> 02:43:39.798]   And it is the historical and factual background constitutional understanding of the separation of powers between the state and the federal government and the power that the people have to restore Principled constitutional government back in America.
[02:43:40.179 --> 02:43:41.459]  We are not powerless.
[02:43:41.960 --> 02:43:44.641]  We are not... America is not lost.
[02:43:45.022 --> 02:43:56.689]  We have powerful, powerful, peaceful means by which our designers of our Constitutional Republic created so that the people could control their government.
[02:43:56.969 --> 02:43:59.771]  And that's what Noncompliant Movie is all about.
[02:43:59.811 --> 02:44:01.712]  It's noncompliantmovie.com.
[02:44:03.666 --> 02:44:04.606]  I love this too.
[02:44:04.766 --> 02:44:05.987]  And it really is.
[02:44:06.187 --> 02:44:09.308]  It is like an aha moment the whole time you're watching it.
[02:44:09.708 --> 02:44:15.130]  Because like the points you brought today, number one, Roe vs. Wade was never a federal law.
[02:44:15.250 --> 02:44:16.671]  Now the media is not going to tell you that.
[02:44:17.211 --> 02:44:18.872]  Rachel Madcow isn't going to tell you that.
[02:44:18.972 --> 02:44:20.052]  No one's going to tell you that.
[02:44:20.232 --> 02:44:24.234]  And so they're acting like they are an affront to freedom.
[02:44:24.494 --> 02:44:27.495]  And what is the rallying cry of the leftist progressive?
[02:44:28.255 --> 02:44:31.336]  Oh my gosh, they might take away your freedom to murder more babies.
[02:44:31.456 --> 02:44:32.316]  Please fight for this.
[02:44:32.376 --> 02:44:33.637]  So it's very, very strange.
[02:44:33.657 --> 02:44:35.917]  I feel like we're living in Sodom and Gomorrah.
[02:44:35.937 --> 02:44:40.779]  I feel like every speech we make out there in America right now needs to be, well, hello, Sodom and Gomorrah.
[02:44:40.799 --> 02:44:42.039]  How's everybody doing today?
[02:44:42.980 --> 02:44:53.443]  And so I wanted you to comment on the sheriffs, the role of the sheriffs, because you're talking to sheriffs all over the country and you're reminding them of their role.
[02:44:53.563 --> 02:44:55.944]  Many sheriffs don't understand their own role.
[02:44:55.984 --> 02:44:57.104]  Can you talk about this for a moment?
[02:44:58.018 --> 02:45:02.559]  Well, the sheriff is a very unique position in America by design.
[02:45:02.959 --> 02:45:06.821]  The sheriff is a constitutional representative of the people.
[02:45:07.361 --> 02:45:13.222]  The sheriff is not a hireling of the governor or the county or the city council or the mayor.
[02:45:13.763 --> 02:45:23.239]   The sheriff is a direct constitutional representative of the people who takes an oath To support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the state.
[02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:27.728]  And inherent in that oath lies the duty of the sheriff.
[02:45:28.337 --> 02:45:30.619]  To guard the rights of the people.
[02:45:31.119 --> 02:45:36.044]  The sheriff is not to be a blind enforcer of the law.
[02:45:36.504 --> 02:45:53.057]   The sheriff is actually a check and balance on both the legislative and executive and judicial branches to ensure that they are all following the Constitution So that he or she can guard the rights of the people.
[02:45:53.598 --> 02:46:04.365]  As the highest executive in the county, even in that county, the sheriff's authority is higher than the governor, if the governor is operating unconstitutionally.
[02:46:04.705 --> 02:46:19.539]   A governor that sends down a mandate that says we're in an emergency and we gotta close down these businesses, or we gotta shut down your church, or we gotta arrest you for being out in public, a sheriff has a duty to stand up and defend
[02:46:19.539 --> 02:46:24.670]   the rights of the people and tell that governor no, not in my county.
[02:46:24.670 --> 02:46:27.510]  And that works the same way with the federal government.
[02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:33.070]   If the federal government sends an agency in, like a Bureau of Disinformation, mind
[02:46:33.070 --> 02:46:38.070]   you, and wants to shut down or arrest someone for their speech or their thought.
[02:46:38.427 --> 02:46:51.176]  It's the sheriff's responsibility as the last and most powerful guard of the people's rights to stand there, to physically stand there and say, no, you're not going to enforce this here.
[02:46:51.216 --> 02:46:53.237]  This is contrary to the Constitution.
[02:46:53.577 --> 02:46:56.239]  This is contrary to the Constitution of my state.
[02:46:56.599 --> 02:47:00.442]  And I will not enforce it and I won't let you enforce it either.
[02:47:01.082 --> 02:47:20.429]  And unfortunately, Kate, our sheriffs have been taught and deceived for a very long time, especially the American people as well, that, oh, well, you can't understand the Constitution unless you're a scholar, or you went to law school, or you're a politician, and now all of a sudden you know everything you need to know about the Constitution.
[02:47:20.829 --> 02:47:22.069]  That's really not true.
[02:47:22.569 --> 02:47:41.367]   Our Constitution was written in 1788 so that the most Any basic person on the street in that year could pick up the Constitution, read it, and know how their government's supposed to act, what it's not supposed to do, and the remedy of the people for its violations.
[02:47:42.017 --> 02:47:46.658]  And so we have to understand as a people that it's not complicated.
[02:47:47.099 --> 02:47:48.719]  It does take some time.
[02:47:48.819 --> 02:47:50.720]  It takes a little bit of effort.
[02:47:51.340 --> 02:47:56.262]  But it is really the children's children's guard for liberty.
[02:47:56.702 --> 02:48:00.003]  We have a responsibility to guard the liberty of our posterity.
[02:48:00.343 --> 02:48:06.985]  And there is no more powerful ally for you than your sheriff, who is a constitutionally minded sheriff.
[02:48:08.692 --> 02:48:18.381]  So when the sheriffs tell you, Chrisanne, you know, hey, if the feds come and they want to do something, I have to go check the laws, the regulations, the policies.
[02:48:18.462 --> 02:48:23.767]  I have to see, you know, I have to work within the confines of this, so I need to know every single law and policy.
[02:48:23.827 --> 02:48:24.868]  What is your answer to that?
[02:48:25.969 --> 02:48:30.874]  Well, the answer to that is, is I'm sorry, sir, you're misinformed.
[02:48:31.254 --> 02:48:32.195]  Go look at your oath.
[02:48:32.754 --> 02:48:36.376]  You don't take an oath to the agencies of the federal government.
[02:48:36.416 --> 02:48:40.017]  You don't take an oath to the regulations of the federal government.
[02:48:40.538 --> 02:48:45.160]  You take an oath to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of your state.
[02:48:45.580 --> 02:48:56.225]   The only thing you have to do is compare what that agent or agency is trying to do or wanting to do with the Constitution.
[02:48:56.605 --> 02:49:04.109]  If it's not consistent with the Constitution, then the sheriff has a duty and obligation to prevent it from happening.
[02:49:04.509 --> 02:49:08.731]  And again, the Constitution is the written standard for government.
[02:49:08.791 --> 02:49:11.012]  It's not a living, breathing document.
[02:49:11.432 --> 02:49:23.396]  It is a written standard that can only be changed through very specific and very arduous means in Article 5 of the Constitution.
[02:49:23.776 --> 02:49:28.798]  So our sheriffs, the class that I teach, Kate, the class that I teach is three hours.
[02:49:29.218 --> 02:49:31.338]  We do a three-hour class for sheriffs.
[02:49:31.779 --> 02:49:39.101]  And we have sheriffs that have left my three-hour continuing education training for them, because I've taught at the academies.
[02:49:39.461 --> 02:49:41.002]  I'm a constitutional attorney.
[02:49:41.362 --> 02:49:43.203]  I am qualified to teach this.
[02:49:43.944 --> 02:49:56.911]  I have had sheriffs who have immediately picked up the phone after taking my class and changed policies and protected the rights of their people because they were finally, finally informed.
[02:49:59.033 --> 02:49:59.653]  I love that.
[02:49:59.713 --> 02:50:00.794]  You just gave me chills.
[02:50:00.994 --> 02:50:01.734]  You really did.
[02:50:02.034 --> 02:50:09.962]   Because when you see that kind of awakening, how amazing that is because everyone is kind of depending on That they know their job.
[02:50:10.242 --> 02:50:16.807]  The problem is, and probably one of the problems you're finding is, you're going out and you're teaching and you're thinking, they don't know their job.
[02:50:17.147 --> 02:50:18.708]  They need to be taught and reminded.
[02:50:18.788 --> 02:50:21.670]  Please get Chrisanne to your local sheriff's office.
[02:50:21.771 --> 02:50:32.358]  Please go remind your sheriff that she needs to come and instruct because we're going to need that last layer of protection like no other in this decade.
[02:50:32.919 --> 02:50:33.299]  For sure.
[02:50:36.861 --> 02:50:38.602]  Yeah, there's no doubt about it.
[02:50:40.062 --> 02:50:40.983]  It's amazing, Kate.
[02:50:41.003 --> 02:50:48.366]  It's absolutely amazing watching the transformation and the sheriffs want to do this.
[02:50:49.006 --> 02:50:56.309]  They want to do this, but no one has ever told them how to do this or that they have the authority to do this.
[02:50:57.626 --> 02:51:00.527]  We have the documentary Noncompliance.
[02:51:01.187 --> 02:51:07.709]  In October, we're going to be releasing a sequel to that, Noncompliant 2, and it's all about the sheriff.
[02:51:08.089 --> 02:51:16.551]  The entire documentary is dedicated to the role, the duty of the sheriff, as established constitutionally and historically.
[02:51:16.571 --> 02:51:18.151]  It's an amazing history.
[02:51:18.757 --> 02:51:29.044]  And every sheriff that we have interviewed for this documentary, Kate, every single one of them without fail has said, I became sheriff because I wanted to protect my people.
[02:51:29.204 --> 02:51:31.445]  I wanted to do right by my community.
[02:51:32.005 --> 02:51:35.528]  And they want to do these things, but nobody is teaching them.
[02:51:35.548 --> 02:51:38.570]  And it's very, very empowering for them.
[02:51:39.010 --> 02:51:40.411]  And by the way, it's not radical.
[02:51:40.951 --> 02:51:47.533]  It's been happening across America, in counties all over America for many, many years.
[02:51:47.933 --> 02:52:00.236]  But the media will not let you see when a sheriff is standing up to a federal agency or standing up to a governor and telling them, no, we're not going to enforce this and neither will you.
[02:52:00.656 --> 02:52:14.083]   Because that overturns the narrative of chaos that the media wants to portray to keep the people in line Thank you, Chrisanne.
[02:52:14.163 --> 02:52:20.509]  In fact, I've said often that we enrolled in an adult education course that we never knew we enrolled in, and that was the nighttime news.
[02:52:21.109 --> 02:52:29.297]  And we have been infiltrated with improper education and misled, and that is exactly why you need to go check out that documentary, Noncompliance.
[02:52:29.657 --> 02:52:35.342]  And also, check out Chrisanne Hall at LibertyFirstSociety.com and get instructed.
[02:52:35.382 --> 02:52:37.744]  Get your grandkids instructed, get your children instructed.
[02:52:38.084 --> 02:52:42.648]  Chrisanne Hall, thank you so much for the logic, everything that you brought to this hour.
[02:52:42.708 --> 02:52:43.068]  Thank you.
[02:52:44.329 --> 02:52:44.909]  Thank you, Kate.
[02:52:44.929 --> 02:52:46.551]  Thank you, Alex, for having Kate.
[02:52:48.913 --> 02:52:49.513]  Absolutely.
[02:52:49.573 --> 02:52:50.034]  Thank you.
[02:52:50.554 --> 02:52:54.077]  And going back to the Alex Jones Show, I'm your guest host, Kate Daly.
[02:52:57.361 --> 02:53:01.442]  Piers Morgan edited tapes of Trump, claimed he stormed out, lied about everything.
[02:53:01.502 --> 02:53:03.463]  The guy is a snake in the grass, we already know that.
[02:53:03.563 --> 02:53:07.764]  But he came out last night and attacked me, and it's blowing up in his face.
[02:53:07.844 --> 02:53:09.364]  People are so sick of this crap.
[02:53:09.404 --> 02:53:12.645]  But if you work for the establishment, you attack Alex Jones, here he is.
[02:53:15.386 --> 02:53:25.809]  Talking of removal from classless to cashless, the name Alex Jones may not be familiar to you, until I replay an old clip from the time he screamed at me about guns on American television.
[02:53:27.142 --> 02:53:30.903]  How many gun murders were there in Britain last year?
[02:53:32.264 --> 02:53:34.945]  How many chimpanzees can dance on the head of a pin?
[02:53:35.165 --> 02:53:36.025]  The tyrants did it.
[02:53:36.245 --> 02:53:37.186]  Hitler took the guns.
[02:53:37.486 --> 02:53:38.486]  Stalin took the guns.
[02:53:38.806 --> 02:53:39.667]  Mao took the guns.
[02:53:39.847 --> 02:53:41.187]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[02:53:41.327 --> 02:53:42.588]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[02:53:42.748 --> 02:53:48.030]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[02:53:49.025 --> 02:53:49.905]  Oh, I hear you crying.
[02:53:49.946 --> 02:53:50.966]  That crazy guy.
[02:53:51.266 --> 02:53:52.507]  Well, Jones isn't just crazy.
[02:53:53.047 --> 02:54:03.272]  He's a nasty piece of work who built a gigantic online following with his InfoWars website and made many millions of dollars peddling mad conspiracy theories about the US government.
[02:54:03.892 --> 02:54:09.115]  His most vile claim was that the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting was faked.
[02:54:09.895 --> 02:54:20.547]  Now, very few tragedies have ever moved me more profoundly than that appalling massacre in which 20 children, aged between 6 and 7, were shot dead in their classrooms by a lone lunatic.
[02:54:21.308 --> 02:54:30.078]  But Alex Jones responded to what happened by saying it was all a government-staged hoax, perpetrated by crisis actors to justify new gun control laws being introduced.
[02:54:31.059 --> 02:54:37.424]  It was a disgusting lie that caused immeasurable new grief and misery to the poor families of the children who died.
[02:54:38.145 --> 02:54:40.927]  But ten of those families decided to sue him for defamation.
[02:54:41.428 --> 02:54:42.028]  And they won.
[02:54:42.368 --> 02:54:43.169]  And they won big.
[02:54:43.710 --> 02:54:51.397]   Now Jones, a great government conspiracy theorist, ...has filed for bankruptcy as he awaits details of the huge damages he'll now have to pay.
[02:54:52.218 --> 02:54:59.286]  And he's been reduced to desperately and pathetically begging the same government he has always said is the enemy of the people for bankruptcy relief.
[02:54:59.787 --> 02:55:00.427]  Oh, the irony.
[02:55:01.268 --> 02:55:03.271]  Jones deserves everything coming his way.
[02:55:03.331 --> 02:55:05.974]  What he did to those Sandy Hook families was beyond despicable.
[02:55:06.494 --> 02:55:09.998]  He's been morally bankrupt for decades, now he'll be financially bankrupt too.
[02:55:10.539 --> 02:55:19.309]  And hopefully that means he'll never again be able to lead such a vile smear campaign like the one he did to desecrate the memory of those 20 young children.
[02:55:20.427 --> 02:55:22.369]  Piers, you're the one that's morally bankrupt.
[02:55:22.529 --> 02:55:30.658]  I'm the one that questioned WMDs in Iraq, Gulf of Tonkin, Operation Northwoods, what happened with people like Jussie Smollett.
[02:55:31.219 --> 02:55:32.801]  And you're the one that lives off that.
[02:55:33.522 --> 02:55:38.007]  You're the one that's a fraud that's anti-free speech, anti-Second Amendment, and a piece of garbage.
[02:55:38.627 --> 02:55:46.310]  And, oh, I'm going to the deep state, as the New York Times said, to do limited bankruptcy to show the public that I don't have hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:55:46.630 --> 02:55:48.811]  These people are trying to get to silence our speech.
[02:55:48.831 --> 02:55:53.433]  They're coming after all of our speech, my speech, your speech, everybody's speech.
[02:55:54.153 --> 02:56:02.276]  And that's why we the people need to realize this is a battle of wills right now and InfoWars is the front line, the main center where that's happening.
[02:56:02.556 --> 02:56:13.600]  So I do need your word of mouth and I do need your financial support just to stay on air and battle these court cases for years and the bankruptcy and everything and stay on air and fight harder than ever as you're seeing now.
