[00:00:00.183 --> 00:00:01.404]  I think it can go both.
[00:00:01.484 --> 00:00:02.564]  I think it can go two ways.
[00:00:03.024 --> 00:00:05.586]  So there's lines being drawn in the sand.
[00:00:06.026 --> 00:00:07.606]  The American people see what's going on.
[00:00:07.626 --> 00:00:08.807]  They see the gas prices.
[00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:09.647]  They see the border.
[00:00:09.687 --> 00:00:12.549]  They see what's going on and their pocketbooks are being affected.
[00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:25.555]  But I think it's going to get to a point where the left is not going to have a choice but to do something drastic.
[00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:28.296]  And I think that may be a blackout nationwide.
[00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:43.835]  I think they may do something to, you know, inhibit the progression moving forward by doing something along the lines of an attack like that, by preventing everything they've worked for to kind of be crumbled.
[00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:45.096]  They'll launch a war.
[00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:46.938]  They'll do a hack attack.
[00:00:46.958 --> 00:00:47.859]  They'll do a blackout.
[00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:48.580]  You're totally right.
[00:00:49.474 --> 00:00:53.315]  But yeah, real quick though, the reason why I say that is because Trump's too easy.
[00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:55.735]  They've already established all these things against Trump.
[00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:57.495]  They can't do that with another candidate.
[00:00:57.535 --> 00:00:59.076]  It would seem too disingenuous.
[00:00:59.836 --> 00:01:05.597]  So I agree with the previous caller about Ron DeSantis supporting red gun laws, like red flag laws.
[00:01:05.717 --> 00:01:06.897]  That's not ideal for us.
[00:01:07.377 --> 00:01:20.877]   So I think Trump will get into position, he'll run, and maybe before, or maybe a little bit after, they'll bring in some kind of Russian blah blah blah hoax, whatever it is, cut our power out, And basically kind of do what they've been talking about.
[00:01:20.897 --> 00:01:22.858]  The reset, basically.
[00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:25.000]  And introduce your cryptocurrencies.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.101]  Introduce the CBDCs.
[00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:29.522]  And if you have dollars, it's going to be useless.
[00:01:30.003 --> 00:01:31.223]  Alright, brother.
[00:01:31.243 --> 00:01:32.004]  I hear you, Dave.
[00:01:32.064 --> 00:01:32.484]  You're right.
[00:01:32.724 --> 00:01:36.266]  The globalists have no limit to what they'll do to maintain control.
[00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:38.027]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:39.008]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[00:01:39.028 --> 00:01:40.309]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:41.690]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.510]  And Joe Rogan?
[00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.231]  Elon Musk?
[00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:44.451]  You know where they tune in, right?
[00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:45.312]  They tune in right here!
[00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:50.079]  InfoWars.
[00:01:50.238 --> 00:01:57.238]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:01:57.238 --> 00:02:01.638]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, "I don't know what's
[00:02:01.638 --> 00:02:04.118]  going to happen at the end of this, but you ought to fight!"
[00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.552]  You better believe you got one!
[00:02:08.474 --> 00:02:13.674]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:02:34.794 --> 00:02:43.174]   Joe Biden, Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates, all the usual suspects are telling us that a new pandemic and lockdowns are
[00:02:43.174 --> 00:02:43.913]  imminent.
[00:02:44.114 --> 00:02:45.314]  Prepare for the next one.
[00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:50.877]  That, you know, I'd say will get attention this time.
[00:02:51.318 --> 00:02:52.378]  Let's look at lockdowns.
[00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.940]  Cost us trillions of dollars.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.663]  And, you know, we're paying for that now with super high inflation.
[00:03:00.243 --> 00:03:07.844]   And I think I'm interested in when Johns Hopkins comes out with a study that said basically that didn't have
[00:03:07.844 --> 00:03:10.844]  any impact on mortality.
[00:03:10.844 --> 00:03:15.844]   And I don't know that that study addressed what mortality might have been impacted
[00:03:15.844 --> 00:03:20.844]  in terms of deferring other, you know, health care.
[00:03:20.844 --> 00:03:26.844]   Can we take lockdowns off the table in terms of what we do in the future?
[00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:30.844]   I can't say because I don't know what that future holds for us.
[00:03:30.844 --> 00:03:32.844]  What about the study that Johns Hopkins did?
[00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:35.933]  Because we're always saying pay attention to the science.
[00:03:36.314 --> 00:03:37.875]  I'm not familiar with that study, sir.
[00:03:38.055 --> 00:03:50.908]  The most recent data demonstrates that you are more likely to become infected or have disease or even death if you've been vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated people.
[00:03:51.808 --> 00:03:53.070]  This is shocking to hear.
[00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.732]  But it is what the data are showing us.
[00:03:56.112 --> 00:04:03.939]  The data now show that these experimental gene therapy treatments can damage your children as well as yourself.
[00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:10.504]  They can damage your heart, your brain, your reproductive tissue, and your lungs.
[00:04:11.144 --> 00:04:15.248]  This can include permanent damage and disablement of your immune system.
[00:04:15.408 --> 00:04:32.954]   As the world plunges into financial crisis via hyperinflation, All of what we are seeing play out in Europe right now is an upsetting of the balance of the world order as they want it, as people like Dr. Harari, as people like Klaus Schwab, and others.
[00:04:33.054 --> 00:04:34.275]  Bill Gates is another one.
[00:04:34.755 --> 00:04:46.360]  So we have to understand that these are people that are very smart, they're very well resourced, and they have a very sort of strategic idea of how they want to see the world develop.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:57.453]   And God, and a soul, Well, there's all the symptoms of the disease that is the New World Order and globalism.
[00:04:58.013 --> 00:05:00.457]  And so the big question is, how do we tackle globalism?
[00:05:00.497 --> 00:05:02.480]  How do we expose globalism?
[00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:05.364]  How do we dismantle and prosecute globalism?
[00:05:05.865 --> 00:05:19.457]  And then separately, how do we recognize the fruits of globalism to wake up our friends, family, neighbors, and strangers so they understand why their lives are getting very bad, why crime is increasing, why they're going bankrupt?
[00:05:20.117 --> 00:05:21.879]  What is the worst thing they're doing?
[00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.561]  What is the number one thing they're doing that we need to stop?
[00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:26.463]  Evaluating the currencies?
[00:05:28.072 --> 00:05:29.032]  Defunding the police.
[00:05:29.613 --> 00:05:31.334]  Dissolving the borders.
[00:05:31.894 --> 00:05:33.334]  Coming after our guns.
[00:05:33.935 --> 00:05:35.215]  Launching war with Russia.
[00:05:35.816 --> 00:05:37.616]  Preparing to release new bioweapons.
[00:05:38.317 --> 00:05:41.278]  But you know, they're not really preparing to release new bioweapons.
[00:05:41.338 --> 00:05:43.239]  They are releasing new bioweapons.
[00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:48.982]  Or targeting a new group of people with their bio-nanotech weapon.
[00:05:49.362 --> 00:05:50.642]  And that is babies.
[00:05:51.283 --> 00:05:53.404]  Six months old.
[00:05:54.528 --> 00:05:54.848]  And up.
[00:05:55.168 --> 00:05:58.549]  Texas Children's Hospital started administering some shots yesterday.
[00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:03.571]  These vaccines are for those kids ages six months through four years.
[00:06:04.091 --> 00:06:10.933]  And because this group just received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration, Dell Medical School is trying to calm worried parents.
[00:06:11.833 --> 00:06:24.839]  The corrupt FDA had three different rounds of resignations, firings, off their board the last year and a half, because the board would not even authorize, authorizing these experimental injections for anybody.
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.981]  So they had one board resign, or large portions of it.
[00:06:28.301 --> 00:06:31.342]  Then they got new people on and said, now we're gonna go down to age 16.
[00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:32.603]  And a bunch of them said no.
[00:06:33.023 --> 00:06:35.965]  Now we're gonna add boosters and shots every few months.
[00:06:35.985 --> 00:06:36.025]  No.
[00:06:36.045 --> 00:06:44.930]   And they've got a board now that unanimously voted to lie to the public and say, That this works great, that it's a vaccine, and that it totally protects you.
[00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:49.149]   When it isn't a vaccine, it doesn't protect you, destroys your immune system,
[00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:53.550]   causes all sorts of serious problems, absolute organized evil,
[00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:59.069]  depopulation against the people of this planet.
[00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:17.069]  [Music]
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.281]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:07:18.382 --> 00:07:39.081]  today.
[00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:48.366]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we have huge developments happening on the geopolitical, world financial stage, domestically, and so much more.
[00:07:50.182 --> 00:07:53.205]  There's a big report that just went live at Infowars.com.
[00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:56.267]  It's getting almost no attention here in the Control Western Press.
[00:07:56.968 --> 00:08:06.996]  The organization of BRICS, that's one of the largest global organizations out there of nations, announces new world reserve currency as America commits economic suicide.
[00:08:07.837 --> 00:08:10.739]  That report I'm going to be breaking down next segment.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.122]  Zelensky demands five billion from NATO.
[00:08:16.377 --> 00:08:19.941]  Cities for security in Europe, whatever that means.
[00:08:20.862 --> 00:08:24.246]  So much insane news breaking on the Ukraine front.
[00:08:24.847 --> 00:08:25.127]  U.S.
[00:08:25.207 --> 00:08:27.770]  officials doubt Ukraine can take back territory.
[00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:30.653]  White House losing confidence.
[00:08:30.673 --> 00:08:31.914]  The Russians are winning the war.
[00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:48.538]   We've got some very dramatic maps we're going to be getting to at the start of the next hour that show Where the Russians have gained control and are keeping control and expanding that control and why those areas they're in control of are so critically important.
[00:08:49.379 --> 00:08:51.801]  That's coming up as well.
[00:08:52.061 --> 00:09:03.170]  Huge news on the targeting of six-month-old babies and up with the experimental shots and the horrible health effects and how the CDC knowingly lied, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:05.723 --> 00:09:09.085]  On the safety data and on the danger to children from COVID.
[00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:09.846]  It is dramatic.
[00:09:09.886 --> 00:09:14.709]  CDC caught using false data to recommend kids the deadly COVID shot.
[00:09:14.749 --> 00:09:16.430]  That's coming up next hour as well.
[00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:27.576]  But in this hour, in this hour, Roger Stone's going to be joining us exclusively at the bottom of the hour here in about 23 minutes from now.
[00:09:28.257 --> 00:09:31.419]  Roger has been massively defamed again.
[00:09:31.499 --> 00:09:33.320]  So have I. So have the American people.
[00:09:34.704 --> 00:09:45.837]  Claiming that Trump called him or told Mark Meadows to call him and to call General Flynn and plan what happened at the Capitol.
[00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:49.761]  It's just absolutely ridiculous.
[00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:52.402]  Trump did not call Roger.
[00:09:52.902 --> 00:09:55.064]  Mark Meadows did not call Roger or General Flynn.
[00:09:55.284 --> 00:09:57.066]  It is totally made up.
[00:09:57.286 --> 00:10:14.058]  But that's why I've had the Jan 6th Committee and federal grand juries and the FBI and the Justice Department want to ask me about a phone call that I supposedly had with Stone and Flynn.
[00:10:15.279 --> 00:10:17.901]  And the answer is, we didn't have the phone call, I'm not talking to you.
[00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.203]  Because you know that, you've got my damn phone records.
[00:10:21.408 --> 00:10:22.670]  And you've got the White House phone records.
[00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:24.213]  They're just making it up.
[00:10:24.233 --> 00:10:27.719]  And the reason I raise that is, the reason Roger's joining us is not just that.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:29.542]  The wheels have come off their deceptions.
[00:10:31.035 --> 00:10:40.779]  This Cassidy Hutchinson, who was fawning after Trump to get a job after he left the White House, was not given a job in Mar-a-Lago, so she's gotten angry and made all this up.
[00:10:40.819 --> 00:10:44.040]  Trump came out yesterday and instantly said, none of this is true.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.962]  And then the Secret Service said, yeah, no such thing happened.
[00:10:47.982 --> 00:10:49.182]  He didn't climb up the front of the car.
[00:10:49.222 --> 00:10:50.082]  He didn't grab the wheel.
[00:10:50.663 --> 00:10:51.443]  None of this is true.
[00:10:51.483 --> 00:10:52.483]  He's sitting way in the back.
[00:10:53.264 --> 00:11:03.596]   And then she also said that she wrote this handwritten note On what Trump's directives were on January 6th, and it turns out she didn't, and they've already had others testify to that.
[00:11:03.676 --> 00:11:06.018]  I mean, the woman is a liar.
[00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:23.771]  And we just see this going on and on and on, committing crimes under oath, and Liz Cheney, it's come out, knew that she was lying, and knew who wrote the handwritten note, but still didn't call her on it.
[00:11:25.575 --> 00:11:26.995]  But why are they able to get away with this?
[00:11:27.075 --> 00:11:27.896]  Because they get away with it.
[00:11:28.016 --> 00:11:31.957]  Because they are not held accountable.
[00:11:33.698 --> 00:11:35.618]  They never get in trouble.
[00:11:36.358 --> 00:11:38.959]  Because the Justice Department is completely corrupt at the top.
[00:11:39.419 --> 00:11:44.501]  These people have a free hand to cut off our pipelines, to get rid of our borders, to devalue our currencies.
[00:11:45.201 --> 00:11:50.283]  For the puppet president's son to have a bunch of child porn and video him having sex with children.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.660]  Underage girls.
[00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:54.462]  All that's okay.
[00:11:55.142 --> 00:11:57.223]  Chinese top spies giving them orders.
[00:11:58.764 --> 00:12:01.205]  All that's come out and they get in zero trouble.
[00:12:01.726 --> 00:12:10.711]  And when you try to cover what's in the laptop during the campaign the last few months of 2020, you get censored, you get shut down, you get targeted.
[00:12:12.392 --> 00:12:30.283]   So that's how this system is operating, and they may not get convicted in the actual courts, but they've been convicted in the Court of Public Opinion, and almost everyone I know that were liberals are now awake and ashamed of themselves, and really, really upset about what's happening.
[00:12:30.323 --> 00:12:36.668]  And it's finally inflation that's really got through to people, and seeing Biden up there saying, well, it's a transition!
[00:12:37.148 --> 00:12:39.369]  Well, inflation's good for you, a few months ago.
[00:12:39.650 --> 00:12:41.871]  And now he's like, oh yeah, you know who's to blame?
[00:12:42.051 --> 00:12:42.432]  Putin.
[00:12:43.312 --> 00:12:45.836]  And the gas stations, they're the ones.
[00:12:47.518 --> 00:12:54.106]  Everybody knows gas stations hardly make any money per gallon of fuel, and they have it there to get you in the store.
[00:12:55.023 --> 00:12:58.766]  So this is just one incredible time to be alive right now.
[00:12:58.786 --> 00:13:04.390]  We're going to be going over all of her lies and more when we come back in the next segment.
[00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:05.351]  And they are dramatic.
[00:13:06.112 --> 00:13:07.353]  And they're just so intense.
[00:13:08.253 --> 00:13:13.478]  But I guess it's really peas in a pod or birds of a feather fly together, flock together.
[00:13:14.598 --> 00:13:19.182]  Because you have Schiff on the committee, who three times we know of he's been caught.
[00:13:19.282 --> 00:13:19.983]  I'm sure there's more.
[00:13:21.178 --> 00:13:27.065]  Totally falsified documents and emails and changed the words around to say something completely different.
[00:13:28.446 --> 00:13:29.287]  She's testifying.
[00:13:29.368 --> 00:13:33.833]  She heard Trump say, I want to join an armed insurrection and take the Capitol over.
[00:13:34.834 --> 00:13:35.815]  There's no other witnesses.
[00:13:35.935 --> 00:13:36.616]  It's not true.
[00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:39.079]  Trump wanted 10,000 in the National Guard there.
[00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:40.701]  Trump was concerned about Antifa.
[00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:42.590]  It doesn't matter.
[00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:44.411]  She's not going to get in trouble.
[00:13:44.971 --> 00:13:50.653]  So she might as well say Trump turns into a demon and has a black tongue that comes out.
[00:13:50.813 --> 00:13:51.553]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:13:51.893 --> 00:13:52.513]  That's me.
[00:13:53.414 --> 00:13:59.076]  CNN has multiple witnesses that I turn into the exorcist and a black tongue shoots out.
[00:14:00.216 --> 00:14:04.557]  And I got to tell you, I didn't cover this a few weeks ago when it first aired, but I'm going to go ahead and play it because it's so funny.
[00:14:05.398 --> 00:14:06.318]  Except it's not funny.
[00:14:06.858 --> 00:14:09.980]  I'd never even heard of a black tongue.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:21.945]  Didn't even know that you, I mean, I know if you get hung, your tongue can turn dark purple when you're dead and kind of stick out of your mouth, but I talked to a medical doctor friend of mine, he said a black tongue's impossible in a living person.
[00:14:22.966 --> 00:14:38.389]   But the point is, it's like Trump's grabbing steering wheels and wants armed insurrections and he's calling us, but he didn't call us and I've got black tongues and become demon possessed, I mean, These people are the demons.
[00:14:38.469 --> 00:14:40.710]  These people are the ones promoting pedophilia.
[00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.592]  These are the people promoting all of this toxic, destructive culture.
[00:14:45.152 --> 00:14:56.859]  And now they're up there with just a steady stream of people lying about myself and Trump and Roger Stone and the American people and flyover country in general.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:09.066]  There are a lot of mentally ill people who are very stupid who think if they can get on CNN or get up in front of Congress and tell a lie that it gives them power or cachet with the elites.
[00:15:09.746 --> 00:15:18.411]  And what it does is points out everybody you're a horrible person and you have blackballed yourself in real society for the rest of your lives.
[00:15:20.593 --> 00:15:21.293]  All of these people.
[00:15:22.665 --> 00:15:23.746]  Have destroyed themselves.
[00:15:23.786 --> 00:15:33.431]  And that goes for all the people that have gone to the New York Times and the Washington Post and CNN and ABC News and just told bald face lies about me.
[00:15:33.811 --> 00:15:35.492]  It doesn't hurt me that they're lying about me.
[00:15:35.552 --> 00:15:36.713]  Nobody believes CNN.
[00:15:36.753 --> 00:15:37.413]  Nobody believes it.
[00:15:37.713 --> 00:15:51.161]  But it's so painful when you've done nothing to people, but they get sucked into the power structure and think they're becoming successful and think they're arriving and think that they are winners.
[00:15:52.517 --> 00:15:56.901]  When all they are is modern Benedict Arnolds, it's extremely sick and sad.
[00:15:56.941 --> 00:16:03.146]  But I gotta say this, if there's no accountability for these lies, what's gonna happen in the future with these people?
[00:16:03.806 --> 00:16:12.674]  They're just gonna tell bigger and bigger and bigger lies, and I guess just discredit themselves more and more, so then they'll double down again, and it just, it's already become absurdist.
[00:16:13.638 --> 00:16:15.038]  Men can have babies.
[00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:20.160]  Don't say a man can't be a woman in California or get arrested.
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.661]  Two women had a baby in prison.
[00:16:22.801 --> 00:16:23.361]  No, they didn't.
[00:16:26.042 --> 00:16:26.742]  Look at these headlines.
[00:16:26.822 --> 00:16:27.782]  I don't believe in witchcraft.
[00:16:28.003 --> 00:16:33.304]  Alex Jones' childhood pal recalls his talking in tongues and having a black tongue.
[00:16:35.345 --> 00:16:35.745]  Wow.
[00:16:37.225 --> 00:16:38.426]  But see, they come up with lies.
[00:16:39.694 --> 00:16:44.237]  So fantastic that people go, well, some of that's got to be real.
[00:16:44.418 --> 00:16:50.962]  I mean, surely they wouldn't say that Trump grabbed the wheel of the Secret Service and tried to hijack the vehicle.
[00:16:51.002 --> 00:16:52.283]  I mean, it's got to be true, right?
[00:16:52.583 --> 00:16:54.084]  Nobody tell a lie that big.
[00:16:54.104 --> 00:16:55.445]  Uh, yeah.
[00:16:56.366 --> 00:16:58.167]  The Secret Service says he's a big fat liar.
[00:16:58.628 --> 00:17:00.949]  Coming up, Roger Stone is angry.
[00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:18.134]   He got defamed again, lied about, implicated in criminal activity, completely Out of the fiction of some woman's mind during the January 6 kangaroo court show trial extravaganza.
[00:17:18.174 --> 00:17:23.396]  And we're going to look at this Cassidy Hutchinson and all the lies.
[00:17:23.436 --> 00:17:28.717]  She's been caught in basically everything she said is a total lie that can instantly be proven to not be true.
[00:17:30.598 --> 00:17:34.459]  But now I know why they think Roger Stone talked to Mark Meadows.
[00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:43.092]   They think I was talking to Trump because people like this are just making it up. I hadn't talked to Trump in like a
[00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:48.413]   year before January 6th. I missed some of his phone calls. He called me a few times. I know because
[00:17:48.413 --> 00:17:53.373]   it was the White House switchboard calling, but I hadn't talked to him in over a year. I frankly didn't
[00:17:53.373 --> 00:17:58.132]   even care to. I was so upset about the whole vaccine thing. I knew he was pigheaded, but
[00:17:58.132 --> 00:18:02.823]   that's a side issue. That's a private matter. The point is, is that you tell these
[00:18:02.823 --> 00:18:04.693]  people I didn't talk to Trump.
[00:18:04.863 --> 00:18:06.923]  They go, fine, we'd like the FBI to come in and talk to you.
[00:18:07.284 --> 00:18:08.804]  No, you got my phone records.
[00:18:09.204 --> 00:18:10.045]  I'm not talking to you.
[00:18:10.245 --> 00:18:10.985]  And then they spin it.
[00:18:11.065 --> 00:18:12.666]  Jones is coming into the FBI.
[00:18:13.526 --> 00:18:16.047]  Jones is coming in to expose Trump.
[00:18:16.067 --> 00:18:18.088]  You see that in the New York Times, Washington Post.
[00:18:19.068 --> 00:18:20.549]  Total lies.
[00:18:21.369 --> 00:18:22.710]  Every stinking bit of it.
[00:18:26.231 --> 00:18:28.732]  And people call me, they go, hey, we hear you're gonna turn on Trump.
[00:18:28.772 --> 00:18:29.813]  Turn on Trump for what?
[00:18:33.035 --> 00:18:34.536]  Trump didn't want the Capitol attack.
[00:18:34.576 --> 00:18:36.177]  He wanted 10,000 National Guard there.
[00:18:36.398 --> 00:18:37.418]  The Fed stood down.
[00:18:37.438 --> 00:18:40.260]  There was up to 1,000 FBI armed in the crowd.
[00:18:40.541 --> 00:18:44.724]  It's been declassified, and they let it happen while I sat there and tried to stop the damn thing.
[00:18:44.744 --> 00:18:47.926]  Anybody needs to be arrested.
[00:18:47.966 --> 00:18:51.149]  It's whoever gave them the orders to stand down, just like Uvalde.
[00:18:52.209 --> 00:18:56.553]  I'm trying not to get angry, but the more I think about this, man, I am just so sick of these people.
[00:18:57.232 --> 00:18:59.792]  Everything they accuse us of is what they've done!
[00:18:59.792 --> 00:19:06.912]  I want that police chief and Yuvaldi arrested.
[00:19:07.015 --> 00:19:14.897]  I want whoever gave the order to the Justice Department for the Feds to stand down that day, because from my sources, they wanted to stop it.
[00:19:14.917 --> 00:19:16.997]  But I'm going to ask the Feds another question.
[00:19:17.157 --> 00:19:21.098]  Why the hell did you follow orders and not stop the few hundred people trying to break in?
[00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:23.499]  See, I'm starting to get really angry right now.
[00:19:23.779 --> 00:19:24.519]  I'm going to calm down.
[00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:25.419]  That's not where I was going.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.780]  Roger Stone's next segment.
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:30.881]  Roger Stone's next segment, we're going to get into all of it then.
[00:19:31.101 --> 00:19:32.142]  Let me just control myself.
[00:19:32.803 --> 00:19:34.464]  But let me tell you what's coming up next hour.
[00:19:34.484 --> 00:19:39.647]  I wasn't going to get to this now, but I just won't have time in this segment because it's a lengthier report for Greg Reese.
[00:19:40.327 --> 00:19:42.289]  It's so important, I'm going to get to it next hour.
[00:19:45.411 --> 00:19:51.755]  Major nations like China and Russia and India have agreed to move off of the dollar.
[00:19:52.588 --> 00:19:59.331]  Now ladies and gentlemen, to describe what it'll mean if that actually happens is curtains financially.
[00:19:59.651 --> 00:20:00.971]  You think we got inflation now?
[00:20:02.512 --> 00:20:07.534]  When the world stops accepting dollars, we turn into the road warrior overnight.
[00:20:08.754 --> 00:20:16.017]  And let me tell you something, I'm ready for this and I'm prepared somewhat and I'm right with God, but I'm scared of this.
[00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:20.135]  I'm not scared of being put in prison or killed for doing the right thing.
[00:20:20.536 --> 00:20:26.369]  But I am scared of bad effects in society and I am scared of the general public when they can't feed their children.
[00:20:26.809 --> 00:20:28.169]  and you got a spoiled nation.
[00:20:28.169 --> 00:20:38.568]   And so you tell the average person, hey, the dollar won't be the reserve currency.
[00:20:38.723 --> 00:20:39.203]  I don't care.
[00:20:39.243 --> 00:20:40.163]  I don't trade currencies.
[00:20:40.483 --> 00:20:48.864]  They have no idea what that even signifies or means if it goes belly up, which every policy of the globalist is to kill the dollar while they claim they're trying to strengthen it.
[00:20:49.204 --> 00:20:50.245]  That's coming up next hour.
[00:20:52.445 --> 00:20:59.106]  Gavin Newsom, the word is, is the one that's going to be replacing Biden if they're able to steal the next election, the next general election.
[00:21:00.146 --> 00:21:04.167]  We have Ghislaine Maxwell sentenced to 20 years in prison for trafficking in those thousands of little girls.
[00:21:05.367 --> 00:21:17.215]  A lot of folks may have forgotten about the 50-plus dead people found in a tractor-trailer in South Texas two days ago, left there to die, locked up inside that death trap by the coyotes.
[00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.198]  There'd been a white guy killing 50 Hispanics.
[00:21:20.238 --> 00:21:23.940]  You'd have top story in the nation, burning cities, white people are evil.
[00:21:25.501 --> 00:21:31.646]  But because it's Hispanics killing Hispanics, nobody cares.
[00:21:31.766 --> 00:21:32.266]  Well, I do.
[00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:33.007]  I care.
[00:21:33.687 --> 00:21:34.848]  And so does the Mexican president.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.320]  Mexico claims U.S.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.401]  can't control its border.
[00:21:38.641 --> 00:21:39.461]  That's not a claim.
[00:21:40.702 --> 00:21:45.324]  It's not being controlled on purpose, and now it's completely broken, and they may never, ever be able to fix it.
[00:21:46.284 --> 00:21:47.025]  The dam's broken.
[00:21:47.085 --> 00:21:49.886]  That's coming up next hour as well, at Roger Stone's next segment.
[00:21:50.946 --> 00:21:52.627]  But let me do this, because it's very, very exciting.

[00:23:36.009 --> 00:23:39.773]  We got to blow it out to fund the operation at infowarestore.com.
[00:23:39.793 --> 00:23:40.874]  And I want to explain something here.
[00:23:42.315 --> 00:23:45.018]  With what's going on in the world, you want to boost your immune system.
[00:23:45.798 --> 00:23:47.720]  And a lot of these products really, really do that.
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.842]  But they do a lot more amazing things as well.
[00:23:50.443 --> 00:23:52.285]  And here's something just as important.
[00:23:53.257 --> 00:24:05.826]  We have to sell these products to have funds to operate in the future, even though most of these products, we only have a few thousand bottles left of, and we're not even sure when we're going to get more, but I'm in that catch-22 of where we've got to move it.
[00:24:06.227 --> 00:24:08.268]  So this could be the last time you ever get these products.
[00:24:08.648 --> 00:24:11.190]  We absolutely need the funding, and they're amazing products.
[00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:14.993]  A 360 win at infowarestore.com.
[00:24:15.353 --> 00:24:20.313]   It is the July 4th super sale blowout that is starting right now.
[00:24:20.313 --> 00:24:26.313]   And I have taken the donations, the Bitcoin donations and things, and put orders in on
[00:24:26.313 --> 00:24:30.612]   eight of our best-selling products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns.
[00:24:30.612 --> 00:24:34.353]   And we got in a bind because the supply chain breakdowns didn't have funds from other products
[00:24:34.353 --> 00:24:35.353]  being sold.
[00:24:35.353 --> 00:24:38.113]   So we didn't have the money to even buy those popular products.
[00:24:38.113 --> 00:24:42.653]   Now they're actually available again, highest quality proprietary.
[00:24:42.653 --> 00:24:44.013]  But now we do.
[00:24:44.013 --> 00:24:48.813]   And so in one month, four of the products come back in and in two months, the other
[00:24:48.813 --> 00:24:49.813]  four products come in.
[00:24:50.132 --> 00:24:57.195]  Hooray, hallelujah, thank you for that donor, so we can take that donation and then double it to stay on the air.
[00:24:57.255 --> 00:24:59.775]  So we're talking about the nick of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:00.196 --> 00:25:06.658]  We are like just right there on the edge of oblivion, but God keeps coming through, through you.
[00:25:07.518 --> 00:25:09.380]  You keep supporting us, so thank you so much.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:18.307]  So please, please take advantage of this July 4th Super Mega Sale with double Patriot Points and up to 75% off.
[00:25:18.507 --> 00:25:20.749]  In fact, we're losing money on that.
[00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.572]  And some products we get that I think are amazing don't sell.
[00:25:23.712 --> 00:25:24.532]  Hair and Beard is that.
[00:25:24.632 --> 00:25:25.373]  Nobody wants it.
[00:25:25.873 --> 00:25:26.194]  Okay?
[00:25:26.394 --> 00:25:28.356]  It's really just a super powerful multivitamin mineral.
[00:25:28.576 --> 00:25:30.497]  Good for women, men, children, you name it.
[00:25:30.597 --> 00:25:32.259]  Very expensive version.
[00:25:32.339 --> 00:25:33.080]  Very fancy.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.283]  It's 75% off right now at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:25:37.663 --> 00:25:39.965]  And don't forget, an Alex Jones is Right t-shirt while you're there.
[00:25:40.325 --> 00:25:44.884]   You know the most frightening part about the deep state Democrats is that they're so arrogant
[00:25:44.884 --> 00:25:49.504]   and so stupid and everything they do blows up in their face but they don't care.
[00:25:49.504 --> 00:25:53.884]   They just double down again with countries like Russia and Vladimir Putin, not just with
[00:25:53.884 --> 00:25:54.884]  the American people.
[00:25:54.884 --> 00:25:55.884]  It is insane.
[00:25:55.884 --> 00:25:58.384]  They've almost killed the dollar.
[00:25:58.384 --> 00:26:01.585]   The BRICS group made up of Russia, China, India and a bunch of other countries says
[00:26:01.585 --> 00:26:04.024]  they're leaving the dollar and it's happening.
[00:26:04.024 --> 00:26:07.404]  I mean you talk about putting America into a collapse.
[00:26:07.404 --> 00:26:09.364]  You talk about running us over the rocks.
[00:26:09.364 --> 00:26:13.205]  we were a ship, this is it, or crashing us into an iceberg.
[00:26:14.173 --> 00:26:17.639]  This is our live Wednesday broadcast, June 29th.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:21.647]  January 6th show trial whistleblower breaks record for congressional perjury.
[00:26:22.327 --> 00:26:28.206]   Cassidy Hutchinson told provable lies repeatedly on national stage with help of Liz Cheney
[00:26:28.206 --> 00:26:30.488]  and other deep state operatives.
[00:26:30.488 --> 00:26:35.086]   And now the Secret Service by name says they want to testify that none of what she said
[00:26:35.086 --> 00:26:38.147]  is true and they never told anyone that.
[00:26:38.147 --> 00:26:42.447]   No one ever claimed that Trump went crazy and tried to grab the wheel and did all this.
[00:26:42.447 --> 00:26:43.447]  It is all made up.
[00:26:43.447 --> 00:26:49.047]   It's also come out that she lied about who wrote a note and said that she did it when
[00:26:49.047 --> 00:26:53.607]   it's on record and already testified who did and Cheney knew that and said nothing.
[00:26:53.607 --> 00:26:59.208]   And then of course there's this lie that Trump supposedly telling Mark Meadows that Roger
[00:26:59.208 --> 00:27:02.847]   Stone's never even talked to Mark Meadows to call him and General Flynn.
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:05.022]  I mean lie after lie after lie.
[00:27:05.062 --> 00:27:05.602]  Here's one of them.
[00:27:07.912 --> 00:27:08.032]  Ms.
[00:27:08.072 --> 00:27:17.315]  Hutchinson, is it your understanding that President Trump asked Mark Meadows to speak with Roger Stone and General Flynn on January 5th?
[00:27:18.275 --> 00:27:18.815]  That's correct.
[00:27:18.855 --> 00:27:19.916]  That is my understanding.
[00:27:21.116 --> 00:27:21.336]  And Ms.
[00:27:21.356 --> 00:27:25.037]  Hutchinson, is it your understanding that Mr. Meadows called Mr. Stone on the 5th?
[00:27:25.858 --> 00:27:32.780]  I'm under the impression that Mr. Meadows did complete both a call to Mr. Stone and General Flynn the evening of the 5th.
[00:27:35.748 --> 00:27:37.049]  They're doing it again, Roger.
[00:27:37.089 --> 00:27:40.971]  They claim that you were in command of WikiLeaks, never talked to Assange, never said you did.
[00:27:41.751 --> 00:27:44.813]  And now they're telling another whopper of a lie and pointing their finger right at you.
[00:27:45.153 --> 00:27:46.474]  How surreal is this, my friend?
[00:27:46.494 --> 00:27:47.114]  Please respond.
[00:27:47.134 --> 00:27:50.436]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:27:50.556 --> 00:27:52.978]  It's deja vu all over again.
[00:27:52.998 --> 00:28:04.360]   I mean, not since the Ukrainian impeachment have I seen a more ham-handed, fabricated, Loose, contrived narrative.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:15.148]  This is essentially an elaborately produced television show with a fictional timeline that's one big infomercial against Donald Trump.
[00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:34.390]   If this was really a January 6th investigation, where is the stunning footage of the cold-blooded murder of Ashley Babbitt, the unarmed, decorated Air Force veteran who was shot in cold blood Without warning, without a stand-down order, and was completely unarmed.
[00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:41.454]  Where is the footage of Roseanne Boylan being bludgeoned to death by Capitol Hill police officers?
[00:28:41.834 --> 00:28:50.099]  Where's an examination of why the enormous doors of the Capitol that can only be opened electronically from the inside were open?
[00:28:50.139 --> 00:28:51.300]  Where are those facts?
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.402]  Instead, they hype this up.
[00:28:54.482 --> 00:28:56.883]  So remember, Alex, it's key to recall.
[00:28:57.264 --> 00:28:59.345]  We were told the hearings were done for June.
[00:29:00.006 --> 00:29:04.148]  Then they hastily said we have a surprise witness in newly found information.
[00:29:04.648 --> 00:29:10.391]  They won't tell anybody all day Thursday, all day, pardon me, the day before, who it is.
[00:29:10.932 --> 00:29:12.452]  It's enormous hype.
[00:29:13.173 --> 00:29:13.793]  Just hype.
[00:29:14.988 --> 00:29:35.281]  And they produce this woman, who not only tells a completely fabricated tale, now debunked by the Secret Service, that Donald Trump, pitch to fit when his detail refused to drive him to the Capitol, tried to grab the wheel, physically impossible, physically assaulted a Secret Service agent, also not true.
[00:29:35.681 --> 00:29:45.027]   And then there's this whopper, as you point out, that the President, she knew, she didn't say she heard, she said, is it your impression, Is it your understanding?
[00:29:45.047 --> 00:29:46.128]  Yes, it's my understanding.
[00:29:46.148 --> 00:29:46.788]  What does that mean?
[00:29:47.349 --> 00:30:04.501]  She alleges that the President told his Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, to call me and General Flynn on January 5th to discuss, to ask us what was going to happen on the 6th.
[00:30:05.522 --> 00:30:09.245]  I've never spoken to Mark Meadows on the phone, ever.
[00:30:10.224 --> 00:30:14.025]  I met him once when he was a congressman in the Green Room at Fox.
[00:30:14.045 --> 00:30:15.665]  Other than that, I've never spoken to him at all.
[00:30:16.265 --> 00:30:18.086]  I just heard from General Flynn.
[00:30:18.466 --> 00:30:20.426]  He also did not hear from Meadows.
[00:30:20.466 --> 00:30:23.967]  He's never spoken to Meadows on the phone on any occasion either.
[00:30:24.387 --> 00:30:27.307]  He met him once in December in the White House.
[00:30:27.827 --> 00:30:30.588]  So, this is an effort to pull us into a narrative.
[00:30:30.728 --> 00:30:34.389]  As you know, Alex, you're subject to it as well as we are.
[00:30:34.949 --> 00:30:51.112]   To be very clear, Any claim or insinuation or even implication that I knew about, was involved in, or condoned any illegal action on January 6th at the Capitol or on any other date and place is categorically false.
[00:30:51.593 --> 00:30:59.354]  Nor was I involved in any of the legal efforts regarding the outcome of the election with Steve Bannon or Giuliani or any of these other folks.
[00:30:59.374 --> 00:31:00.155]  So let me ask you this.
[00:31:00.235 --> 00:31:03.015]  Clearly they've been trying to ask you and me about Mark Meadows.
[00:31:03.035 --> 00:31:05.556]  You've never talked to Meadows, neither have I. This is all made up.
[00:31:06.256 --> 00:31:07.677]  So we know it's coming from the committee.
[00:31:07.877 --> 00:31:10.218]  They're making this up and having her lie.
[00:31:10.678 --> 00:31:23.162]  Why would they have her lie about such demonstrably provable things that we didn't talk to Trump, you didn't talk to Trump, General Flynn didn't talk to Trump about that, or that day, expanding.
[00:31:23.382 --> 00:31:29.104]  Why would she say he grabbed the wheel and tell such a crazy lie when she knew the Secret Service would come out and say she's a liar?
[00:31:29.384 --> 00:31:33.386]  Do they just think that a lie goes halfway around the world where the truth puts its pants on?
[00:31:34.531 --> 00:31:35.851]  Let's take this in two parts.
[00:31:36.211 --> 00:31:42.893]  If you can attack Roger Stone and Alex Jones on Twitter, then you can whip up a hysteria, which is the purpose of these hearings.
[00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:45.214]  So this is used for our vilification.
[00:31:45.634 --> 00:31:55.656]  If you want to pull the names of the two of the most hated villains on the American left into any outgoing post, include the names Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[00:31:56.096 --> 00:32:04.506]  The level of hatred, the tsunami of hatred that this whips up against us, Alex, is useful to these people, even though it is completely baseless.
[00:32:04.986 --> 00:32:13.236]  On the second issue, I am a little surprised, but look, these are the same people who made up and edited the Ukraine phone call.
[00:32:13.823 --> 00:32:14.944]  It's the same exact people.
[00:32:15.005 --> 00:32:18.709]  This is an Adam Schiff production, and you should never forget that.
[00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:25.958]  So, truth, facts have nothing to do with it, and of course the lying by omission about January 6th.
[00:32:26.519 --> 00:32:28.201]  Where's the testimony of Ray Epps?
[00:32:28.601 --> 00:32:32.206]  When is FBI operative Ray Epps going to testify?
[00:32:32.486 --> 00:32:36.531]  We've seen video of him urging people into the building, urging violence.
[00:32:36.931 --> 00:32:42.078]  At the same time, you and Ali Alexander are telling people to pull back and not to go into the Capitol.
[00:32:42.338 --> 00:32:43.800]  He's urging people to go in.
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:45.542]  Where is his testimony?
[00:32:47.455 --> 00:33:12.457]  So I ask the question again, and you just explained it there, but why do they think they can get away with it when they know there's phone records showing this call didn't happen, when they know that he didn't attack the Secret Service driver and try to take control of the vehicle, he can't even get up to the front of the vehicle the way it's designed, why would they say that she wrote a note that's on the congressional record that somebody else wrote, who's testified they did, why would she just tell lie after lie after lie?
[00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:18.176]  Because they count on the fact that the initial charge will get enormous coverage.
[00:33:18.637 --> 00:33:19.598]  Enormous coverage.
[00:33:20.019 --> 00:33:21.180]  Everywhere across the board.
[00:33:21.521 --> 00:33:25.026]  In the Trump-hating legacy media.
[00:33:25.847 --> 00:33:37.578]   And they also know that it is only largely the conservative outlets like InfoWars, Breitbart, The National File, Frank's speech, that will cover the fact that much of this is debunked.
[00:33:37.919 --> 00:33:40.641]  So, they still do their damage.
[00:33:40.701 --> 00:33:51.068]  Now, they look foolish, but watch how quickly the truth about this incident with the Secret Service agent rotates out of the press.
[00:33:51.208 --> 00:34:00.755]  Yet, they have made the case that Trump is unhinged, that was the purpose, and then they try to drag our names into it just to whip up more hatred and more violence.
[00:34:01.914 --> 00:34:16.546]  When we come back, I want to get your view over all the 2022 midterms coming up, and what tricks you think the deep state might pull, and also the situation with the economy, and more, and just generally where you see the J6 hearings going.
[00:34:16.566 --> 00:34:23.131]  I know you're on record saying they've fallen on their face, everybody else agrees, low ratings, but they don't seem to give up.
[00:34:23.171 --> 00:34:25.053]  What are you expecting to do next with 40 seconds?
[00:34:26.144 --> 00:34:28.365]  Well, they have an audience of one, Merrick Garland.
[00:34:28.405 --> 00:34:30.806]  Can they convince him to charge Donald Trump?
[00:34:30.846 --> 00:34:32.306]  I think that's the question on the table.
[00:34:32.706 --> 00:34:33.947]  That's what they are seeking to do.
[00:34:33.987 --> 00:34:40.569]  They're seeking to write a contrived indictment of Donald Trump and hand it over to the Attorney General.
[00:34:42.169 --> 00:34:43.590]  Wow, you talk about reckless.
[00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:46.651]  How could they convince this young woman to do stuff like this?
[00:34:48.226 --> 00:34:58.993]  Well, what's particularly odious is the fact that she said all these things, yet after this period where she makes all these assertions against the president, she was seeking to join his staff at Mar-a-Lago.
[00:34:59.073 --> 00:35:03.115]  She was seeking to go into his, you know, his post-president staff.
[00:35:03.135 --> 00:35:04.656]  Sure, so it's Sour Grapes.
[00:35:04.756 --> 00:35:05.937]  It's Sour Grapes.
[00:35:05.997 --> 00:35:07.037]  It's disgruntled employee.
[00:35:07.057 --> 00:35:07.117]  Wow.
[00:35:07.157 --> 00:35:09.379]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone exclusive.
[00:35:09.399 --> 00:35:09.859]  Stay with us.
[00:35:10.179 --> 00:35:16.063]  Hutchinson, when you returned to the White House in the motorcade after the president's speech, where did you go?
[00:35:17.571 --> 00:35:25.014]  When I returned to the White House, I walked upstairs towards the Chief of Staff's office and I noticed Mr. Renato lingering outside of the office.
[00:35:25.294 --> 00:35:30.676]  Once we had made eye contact, he quickly waved me to go into his office, which was just across the hall from mine.
[00:35:31.736 --> 00:35:41.600]  When I went in, he shut the door and I noticed Bobby Engel, who is the head of Mr. Trump's security detail, sitting in a chair, looking somewhat discombobulated and a little lost.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:48.266]   I looked at Tony and he had said, Did you effing hear what happened in The Beast?
[00:35:49.286 --> 00:35:51.767]  I said, no, Tony, I just got back.
[00:35:52.567 --> 00:35:53.208]  What happened?
[00:35:55.688 --> 00:36:10.234]  Tony proceeded to tell me that when the president got in The Beast, he was under the impression from Mr. Meadows that the off-the-record movement to the Capitol was still possible and likely to happen, but that Bobby had more information.
[00:36:11.434 --> 00:36:17.919]  So once the president had gotten into the vehicle with Bobby, he thought that they were going up to the Capitol.
[00:36:18.199 --> 00:36:22.182]  And when Bobby had relayed to him, we're not, you don't have the assets to do it.
[00:36:22.502 --> 00:36:23.223]  It's not secure.
[00:36:23.844 --> 00:36:25.185]  We're going back to the West Wing.
[00:36:26.726 --> 00:36:32.010]  The president had very strong, a very angry response to that.
[00:36:34.312 --> 00:36:35.913]  Tony described him as being irate.
[00:36:38.395 --> 00:36:41.999]   The president said something to the effect of, I'm the effing president.
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.820]  Take me up to the Capitol now.
[00:36:45.321 --> 00:36:49.483]  To which Bobby responded, sir, we have to go back to the West Wing.
[00:36:51.123 --> 00:36:55.885]  The president reached up towards the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel.
[00:36:57.906 --> 00:37:03.128]  Mr. Engle grabbed his arm, said, sir, you need to take your hand off the steering wheel.
[00:37:04.108 --> 00:37:06.029]  We're going back to the West Wing.
[00:37:06.349 --> 00:37:07.630]  We're not going to the Capitol.
[00:37:09.645 --> 00:37:13.126]  Mr. Trump then used his free hand to lunge towards Bobby Engel.
[00:37:13.547 --> 00:37:18.588]  And when Mr. Renato had recounted this story to me, he had motioned towards his clavicles.
[00:37:19.989 --> 00:37:23.470]  Look, I'm not going to bore you with the clips of the lies of the January 6th committee.
[00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:24.391]  It's all over the news.
[00:37:25.291 --> 00:37:35.155]  She came out and she said he lunged towards the steering wheel, tried to grab control, and hijacked the vehicle, which is, again, the most insane-sounding thing you could come up with.
[00:37:37.366 --> 00:37:45.372]  Now Trump has said, hey, I wanted to go to the Capitol and the Secret Service said it wasn't safe and overrode me and took me back to the White House.
[00:37:46.353 --> 00:37:50.456]  But obviously Trump did not lunge up and grab the wheel.
[00:37:51.416 --> 00:38:16.709]   She's been caught in a bunch of other lies, one of them about Roger Stone and General Flynn, who they're just desperate, desperate, desperate, desperate to tie to this big lie that there was this planned attack, and now Roger We have this video I'll play in a moment of the Proud Boys days before January 6th in a Zoom conversation saying we're there to be peaceful.
[00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:21.071]  We're not there to cross the line and fight with anybody or go into the Capitol.
[00:38:21.632 --> 00:38:23.092]  We are there to be guardians.
[00:38:23.132 --> 00:38:24.633]  That's what I'd heard they were there to be.
[00:38:25.073 --> 00:38:27.995]  Our concern was Antifa bombing the hotel or shooting us.
[00:38:28.455 --> 00:38:29.716]  That's why we had security.
[00:38:30.616 --> 00:38:31.997]  I had my own paid security.
[00:38:32.197 --> 00:38:34.438]  You had volunteer security.
[00:38:34.998 --> 00:38:36.179]  That's what our belief was.
[00:38:36.259 --> 00:38:39.841]  No one even imagined this would happen because we always have peaceful rallies.
[00:38:39.861 --> 00:38:40.902]  We just had two huge ones.
[00:38:41.382 --> 00:38:43.904]  One with a half a million folks a month before in DC.
[00:38:43.964 --> 00:38:51.609]  So you got caught off by the break when I was asking why would a young woman lie like this and what will the Jan 6th committee do next when this is obviously not working.
[00:38:51.669 --> 00:38:56.632]  I'd like you to elaborate just in general about the Democratic Party's attempt to outlaw their political opposition.
[00:38:57.679 --> 00:39:00.603]  Well, look, the purpose of this is just a relentless attack.
[00:39:00.643 --> 00:39:02.165]  You said it earlier, Alex.
[00:39:02.205 --> 00:39:03.987]  They hate us because we're warriors.
[00:39:04.448 --> 00:39:07.052]  So for me, this means bigger and bigger legal fees.
[00:39:07.773 --> 00:39:10.096]  I have to pay attorneys to defend myself.
[00:39:10.476 --> 00:39:28.855]   I've already, as you know, Uh, met my legal obligations under their subpoena, but I pled the Fifth Amendment, not because I've done anything wrong, not because I have anything to hide, but because I have extensive experience with their ability to twist innocuous, immaterial, irrelevant things you say into a crime.
[00:39:29.375 --> 00:39:32.798]  My wife and I still face 11 civil lawsuits.
[00:39:33.279 --> 00:39:42.086]  These are harassment suits that are sensationalized but baseless, designed to drag your name through the mud and to gin up more legal fees.
[00:39:42.367 --> 00:39:44.709]  So folks can help me at Stone Defense Fund.
[00:39:45.830 --> 00:39:47.731]  StoneDefenseFund.com.
[00:39:48.091 --> 00:39:49.112]  I need your help there.
[00:39:49.832 --> 00:39:58.618]  Only through the support of the Infowarrior community and so many other patriots have I been able to continue to fend off these demons.
[00:39:59.038 --> 00:40:00.259]  They attack you, Alex.
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.380]  They attack me.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.581]  They are relentless.
[00:40:03.001 --> 00:40:07.824]  They have no regard for truth or fact or reality.
[00:40:08.125 --> 00:40:11.347]  This is all an elaborately produced television show.
[00:40:12.267 --> 00:40:12.988]  They're desperate.
[00:40:13.638 --> 00:40:14.999]  To eliminate Donald Trump.
[00:40:15.179 --> 00:40:17.260]  That's the greatest question.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:25.465]  And Roger, so there's successful punishing Trump supporters and punishing leaders of the populist peaceful resistance, but they're not successful winning hearts and minds.
[00:40:25.545 --> 00:40:31.488]  As you know, all the polls show what I believe is the biggest political realignment since 1776.
[00:40:32.208 --> 00:40:36.431]  A total turning against the Democratic Party and other leftist groups around the world.
[00:40:36.471 --> 00:40:37.411]  That's what I'm seeing.
[00:40:37.712 --> 00:40:38.372]  What are you seeing?
[00:40:39.281 --> 00:40:40.342]  Well, potentially yes.
[00:40:40.522 --> 00:41:21.188]   We are a majority, and between gas prices, food shortages, epic inflation, foreign policy bungling in which we lose billions of dollars of sophisticated offensive equipment in Afghanistan, writing a check for $40 billion for Ukraine When we can't spend, you know, 5.7 million to seal our own southern border, a fentanyl epidemic in the country, a crime epidemic in the country, based on the fact that the prosecutors in most major cities, elected with the financial help of George Soros, refuse to prosecute violent crime of any kind.
[00:41:21.768 --> 00:41:23.008]  So the stage is set.
[00:41:23.148 --> 00:41:30.445]   However, Alex, Your premise requires a free, fair, honest, transparent election.
[00:41:31.106 --> 00:41:38.890]  And the movement for electoral law reform has not come far enough since the last election to ensure that in every state.
[00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:47.434]  In fact, ironically, the states who have improved their election laws are overwhelmingly Republican states that were already carried by Donald Trump.
[00:41:48.155 --> 00:41:50.776]  But Arizona's process has not been cleaned up.
[00:41:51.477 --> 00:41:54.118]  Nevada's process has not been cleaned up.
[00:41:54.935 --> 00:41:58.896]  Pennsylvania's mail-in ballots are before the Supreme Court.
[00:41:59.257 --> 00:42:02.117]  They're unconstitutional, but they may be in place.
[00:42:03.418 --> 00:42:09.340]  So it's just too early to say whether this red wave can manifest itself in an honest election.
[00:42:10.523 --> 00:42:23.914]  The fundamentals are very definitely there for a great Republican resurgence, but that does not mean it's a Magna resurgence or an America First resurgence if the Congress is controlled by the RINOs.
[00:42:24.014 --> 00:42:24.294]  That's right.
[00:42:24.313 --> 00:42:27.873]   the RINOs can use this wave and get in there, then we're right back where we were unless
[00:42:27.873 --> 00:42:36.373]   we have a strong cadre or a swing vote, as you've said, of MTG types, of Jim Jordan types,
[00:42:36.373 --> 00:42:42.114]   of Matt Gaetz types that can then be the siding factor and can checkmate the RINOs and the
[00:42:42.114 --> 00:42:43.313]  leftists.
[00:42:43.313 --> 00:42:48.094]   Let's get to this Proud Boys clip because it's important and I want to finish up here
[00:42:48.094 --> 00:42:49.594]  with January 6th.
[00:42:49.594 --> 00:42:51.992]  We still have hundreds and hundreds of people in jail.
[00:42:51.992 --> 00:42:54.114]  Many of them have not had a trial yet.
[00:42:54.114 --> 00:43:00.594]   They're in gulags while Democrats bomb abortion, anti-abortion birthing centers around the
[00:43:00.594 --> 00:43:02.114]  country and firebomb them.
[00:43:02.165 --> 00:43:02.925]  It's just insane.
[00:43:02.965 --> 00:43:17.915]  And now we have this video from Zoom that it turns out the prosecution had but hadn't handed over, was trying to block from some of these trials that are starting where they're openly talking about their plan not to get in fights with Antifa first and to not go into the Capitol.
[00:43:17.955 --> 00:43:18.315]  Here it is.
[00:43:20.350 --> 00:43:25.674]  We're never going to be the ones to cross the police barrier or cross something in order to get to somebody.
[00:43:26.074 --> 00:43:28.256]  We're always going to be the ones standing back, right?
[00:43:29.197 --> 00:43:31.399]  And we're always going to be the ones to defend.
[00:43:31.439 --> 00:43:32.499]  And we've been really good at it.
[00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:35.202]  We've been, let's be honest, we've been really good at that.
[00:43:37.003 --> 00:43:43.448]  And it goes on for 20 minutes, the videos up on Infowars.com and the Gateway Pundit.
[00:43:43.568 --> 00:44:03.281]   So this is just You know, a few weeks before, there's also other videos of days before, and they go through great detail how we're peaceful, we're not gonna attack anybody, we're not gonna invade anything, and then they see the doors open, they see this all happen, some of them go in, and they're charged with seditious conspiracy, Roger.
[00:44:05.206 --> 00:44:09.169]  Alex, look, this is a constant game of guilt by association.
[00:44:09.689 --> 00:44:11.350]  No, I'm not a member of the Proud Boys.
[00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:12.150]  I never have been.
[00:44:12.471 --> 00:44:15.012]  Yes, I do know individual members of the Proud Boys.
[00:44:15.412 --> 00:44:21.756]  No, I don't approve of any violent or illegal act on January 6th, and I know nothing about any plan to do so.
[00:44:22.177 --> 00:44:27.040]  I noticed that members of the Proud Boys have been charged and will go to trial.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.442]  This would seem to be excellent evidence in their defense.
[00:44:30.862 --> 00:44:33.283]  Beyond that, I hadn't seen it until now.
[00:44:34.464 --> 00:44:42.771]  But this constant guilt by Association Stone, who is associated with the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers.
[00:44:42.831 --> 00:44:47.414]  Let me be clear, I couldn't hire private security because none was available.
[00:44:47.915 --> 00:44:58.563]  All of the off-duty DC police officers who had provided security for me and my family during my trial, and the many pre-trial motions for which I had to visit Washington, were unavailable.
[00:44:58.983 --> 00:45:02.465]  I accepted the voluntary security of the Oath Keepers.
[00:45:03.105 --> 00:45:09.467]  I have no knowledge of any individual or collective Oath Keepers having any illegal plans on January 6th.
[00:45:09.487 --> 00:45:26.014]  Yes, Roger, we know, and I'm in the same boat 100%, but all I'm getting at is this persecution of American citizens and their rights being violated is extremely dangerous, and if they continue to have their rights violated, it sets a precedent for all of us to be turned into basically Julian Assange.
[00:45:27.582 --> 00:45:29.603]  That is absolutely true, plus the spying state.
[00:45:29.623 --> 00:45:32.204]  I mean, you have been a big advocate for Volta Wireless.
[00:45:32.404 --> 00:45:40.086]  It's a product I like because I don't want the government or Google or Apple collecting all the information from my cell phone.
[00:45:42.927 --> 00:45:48.809]  We've seen in the last that the FBI has used warrantless searches on three million Americans.
[00:45:48.869 --> 00:45:49.910]  That came out recently.
[00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:54.491]  CDC is tracking people through their cell phones, over a million citizens.
[00:45:54.911 --> 00:45:56.672]  So this is my other great concern.
[00:45:57.830 --> 00:46:10.821]  We only got about 45 seconds left, but Roger, will the January 6th committee or this new liar they've put up in front of them that reminds me of that Colonel Vidman or whatever his name was, will they ever get in trouble for their lies?
[00:46:10.841 --> 00:46:14.644]  Because you were charged for lying to Congress and you didn't, but she's ball-faced lying.
[00:46:15.532 --> 00:46:17.755]  Yeah, and nothing will happen about that whatsoever.
[00:46:17.796 --> 00:46:19.218]  Certainly not under the Democrats.
[00:46:19.258 --> 00:46:22.523]  If you take control, the Republicans can take control of the House.
[00:46:22.543 --> 00:46:26.348]  Will they go vindictively and refer her to justice?
[00:46:26.388 --> 00:46:29.032]  They might, but then I don't see justice charging her.
[00:46:29.333 --> 00:46:31.296]  No, we have a two-tiered justice system.
[00:46:31.796 --> 00:46:35.298]  These people tried to destroy my life when I didn't lie to Congress.
[00:46:36.018 --> 00:46:42.822]  Yet people like Rod Rosenstein, Vindman, many others, and of course the congressmen themselves, they're exempt.
[00:46:42.962 --> 00:46:46.924]  So they can't be held responsible for lies that they tell on the floor.
[00:46:47.124 --> 00:46:50.025]  They can't be sued for vilifying you on the floor.
[00:46:50.045 --> 00:46:52.907]  But they are being convicted in the court of public opinion.
[00:46:53.927 --> 00:46:56.108]  Trump's gonna run in 2024, we know that.
[00:46:56.128 --> 00:46:56.909]  30 seconds.
[00:46:56.969 --> 00:46:59.270]  When does he announce and what happens to DeSantis?
[00:47:00.556 --> 00:47:03.099]  I think he announces sooner rather than later.
[00:47:03.199 --> 00:47:05.081]  I think he announces as early as July.
[00:47:05.101 --> 00:47:10.066]  I think these kind of attacks probably accelerate that, if anything.
[00:47:10.726 --> 00:47:17.132]  DeSantis needs to stick to his knitting and get reelected governor before he could move out openly in a presidential campaign.
[00:47:17.633 --> 00:47:20.636]  I do think he is sizing up, taking on the champ.
[00:47:21.275 --> 00:47:22.816]  New national poll last week.
[00:47:22.936 --> 00:47:28.618]  Adam McLaughlin and Associates and the Gateway Pundit shows that Trump easily dispatches all comers.
[00:47:28.938 --> 00:47:29.998]  It's his race to lose.
[00:47:30.198 --> 00:47:30.898]  Hold on, Roger.
[00:47:30.958 --> 00:47:31.879]  This is too hot.
[00:47:31.919 --> 00:47:33.559]  Do five more minutes with us if you can.
[00:47:33.579 --> 00:47:35.600]  I want you to continue to talk about the midterms.
[00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:36.821]  But first, more on Trump.
[00:47:37.081 --> 00:47:41.762]  As early as this July, meaning like a week, he could be announcing the 2024 run?
[00:47:41.822 --> 00:47:42.302]  Wow!
[00:47:43.563 --> 00:47:49.205]  Well, it's Roger Stone that helped prime the pump to get President Trump to run.
[00:47:50.456 --> 00:47:52.018]  And he is a close confidant of him.
[00:47:52.038 --> 00:47:52.779]  I'll leave it at that.
[00:47:53.279 --> 00:47:55.462]  First rule of Fight Club is don't talk about Fight Club.
[00:47:55.502 --> 00:48:01.429]  But Trump wasn't going to run for president right after they stole the election from him.
[00:48:01.929 --> 00:48:09.799]  But then because of the lies and the attacks and him seeing the country run in the dirt, he told Roger and many others, since it's now come out, yeah, I'm running.
[00:48:10.734 --> 00:48:12.556]  And that was what, six, seven months ago?
[00:48:13.236 --> 00:48:18.981]  And so I just asked Roger, and I want him to start over and repeat it, because this is, without being interrupted by a break, this is big news.
[00:48:19.721 --> 00:48:26.947]  Roger Stone just said as early as next month, Trump could declare, what, on July 4th, next Monday?
[00:48:27.467 --> 00:48:31.090]  Trump could declare he's running for president again.
[00:48:31.311 --> 00:48:33.712]  Man, you talk about explosive.
[00:48:33.772 --> 00:48:35.474]  Roger, please, start over.
[00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:45.193]  In all honesty, Alex, as I've said here on the program before, I expected the president to wait till after the midterms, but to become a candidate fairly early.
[00:48:46.133 --> 00:48:55.776]  I now believe that he could be accelerating his timeframe because all of these attacks on him need to be seen in the context of the political attacks there are.
[00:48:56.416 --> 00:49:01.498]  And the reason they're attacking him is because they don't want him to run, so therefore he will defy them, I think.
[00:49:02.088 --> 00:49:02.948]  By running.
[00:49:03.689 --> 00:49:06.550]  I do think it could be as early as the first week of July.
[00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:09.351]  Now, there's a bunch of fake news stories out there.
[00:49:09.411 --> 00:49:18.435]  There's one specifically that said he wants to announce at a location somewhere, somehow close to the governor's mansion in Tallahassee, Florida.
[00:49:18.815 --> 00:49:19.815]  I totally agree with you.
[00:49:19.875 --> 00:49:20.776]  I really like DeSantis.
[00:49:20.796 --> 00:49:25.077]  I know you've had some issues with DeSantis, but I like what he's doing on the vaccines.
[00:49:25.097 --> 00:49:25.557]  I like what he's doing.
[00:49:25.577 --> 00:49:26.377]  He's becoming more hardcore.
[00:49:26.197 --> 00:49:28.536]  The polls don't reflect that.
[00:49:28.536 --> 00:49:33.536]   I think the president is running to grab the narrative because he is on attack and he needs
[00:49:33.536 --> 00:49:38.257]  a superior platform from which to counterattack.
[00:49:38.257 --> 00:49:39.817]  I totally agree with you.
[00:49:39.817 --> 00:49:40.817]  I really like DeSantis.
[00:49:40.817 --> 00:49:44.097]   I know you've had some issues with DeSantis, but I like what he's doing on the vaccines.
[00:49:44.097 --> 00:49:45.336]  I like what he's doing.
[00:49:45.336 --> 00:49:46.896]  He's becoming more hardcore.
[00:49:46.896 --> 00:49:48.576]  What are your concerns about DeSantis?
[00:49:48.576 --> 00:49:51.177]  Well, he's very, very disciplined.
[00:49:51.223 --> 00:49:52.883]  He's been very good on some issues.
[00:49:53.023 --> 00:49:55.124]  I like the way he's taken on the culture wars.
[00:49:55.544 --> 00:49:58.285]  I liked his crackdown against the mask mandates.
[00:49:58.745 --> 00:50:02.146]  He did advocate the vaccination pretty aggressively early on.
[00:50:03.067 --> 00:50:05.468]  But look, I don't want him to run off and be president.
[00:50:05.808 --> 00:50:07.648]  I want him to finish the job in Florida.
[00:50:08.369 --> 00:50:14.951]  Remember, Andrew Gillum, who was arrested just days ago, came within 30,000 votes of beating Ron DeSantis.
[00:50:15.391 --> 00:50:20.474]  And while DeSantis is popular, he's also, like Trump, extremely polarizing.
[00:50:21.254 --> 00:50:23.015]  This is not a red state, Alex.
[00:50:23.035 --> 00:50:24.336]  This is a purple state.
[00:50:24.776 --> 00:50:26.437]  It swings blue, it swings red.
[00:50:27.298 --> 00:50:28.979]  And I want the governor to stay here.
[00:50:29.039 --> 00:50:31.120]  The alternative is a disaster.
[00:50:33.064 --> 00:50:37.346]  So, did Trump tell you this, or a little bird, or you're just looking at the calculus?
[00:50:37.726 --> 00:50:45.989]  A July 4th announcement of Trump during the January 6th committee would politically show that this is a political targeting right out in the open.
[00:50:47.054 --> 00:50:55.281]  I'm not going to identify my source, but I think it is highly, highly probable that we're looking at a July announcement.
[00:50:55.341 --> 00:51:00.585]  Now, the thing to remember about Donald Trump is he's perfectly capable of changing his mind on a dime.
[00:51:01.386 --> 00:51:03.287]  That's called tactical flexibility.
[00:51:04.108 --> 00:51:09.292]  The only thing predictable about Donald Trump is that he's totally and completely unpredictable.
[00:51:11.417 --> 00:51:14.598]  Roger, obviously when I get off air today, this is very interesting news.
[00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:15.638]  I'm glad I asked the question.
[00:51:16.018 --> 00:51:19.119]  I'll be needing to call you for a little confidential discussion, but this is very big.
[00:51:19.459 --> 00:51:20.959]  We really appreciate you sharing this with us.
[00:51:21.379 --> 00:51:23.020]  Again, people really need to support you.
[00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:29.361]  It's great to go make donations for the legal fund to keep you in the fight, but people also need to get some of those sexy t-shirts you've got.
[00:51:29.401 --> 00:51:31.722]  I mean, seriously, your t-shirt designers are amazing.
[00:51:31.962 --> 00:51:35.403]  How do folks get a Roger Stone shirt or an Ultra Maga shirt?
[00:51:36.604 --> 00:51:37.004]  Perfect.
[00:51:37.224 --> 00:51:39.305]  Go to RogerStoneStore.com.
[00:51:39.385 --> 00:51:40.806]  RogerStoneStore.com.
[00:51:40.846 --> 00:51:41.886]  You can get this t-shirt.
[00:51:41.986 --> 00:51:45.228]  You can get the iconic Roger Stone t-shirt.
[00:51:45.328 --> 00:51:47.849]  RogerStoneStore.com.
[00:51:47.889 --> 00:51:50.450]  Can I have permission to, I mean, to rip that off?
[00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:51.451]  That's a really cool design.
[00:51:51.731 --> 00:51:52.831]  Stand up for us so we can see it.
[00:51:54.012 --> 00:51:54.892]  That looks really good.
[00:51:56.133 --> 00:51:56.753]  Absolutely.
[00:51:56.773 --> 00:51:58.254]  Yeah, we're gonna make something similar to that.
[00:51:59.114 --> 00:52:02.016]  But even better, Alex, why don't you post my link online?
[00:52:02.036 --> 00:52:03.596]  That would really help the Stone family.
[00:52:03.997 --> 00:52:04.597]  We will, brother.
[00:52:05.214 --> 00:52:05.854]  All right, there you go.
[00:52:05.874 --> 00:52:06.455]  Let me see the back.
[00:52:06.495 --> 00:52:07.035]  Anything on the back?
[00:52:09.257 --> 00:52:10.557]  Let me see the Nixon tattoo.
[00:52:10.598 --> 00:52:11.018]  Pull it up.
[00:52:11.898 --> 00:52:12.479]  No, no, no.
[00:52:12.499 --> 00:52:13.559]  It's gonna go viral.
[00:52:13.599 --> 00:52:14.380]  Oh, I can't see it?
[00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.042]  You'd have to pay extra for that.
[00:52:17.362 --> 00:52:19.083]  Oh, that's the striptease, huh?
[00:52:20.364 --> 00:52:21.925]  All right, buddy, we'll talk soon.
[00:52:21.945 --> 00:52:22.585]  Thank you so much.
[00:52:23.846 --> 00:52:24.406]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:52:24.426 --> 00:52:24.967]  Keep fighting.
[00:52:25.187 --> 00:52:26.348]  All right, we'll be right back with big news.
[00:52:26.368 --> 00:52:26.708]  Stay with us.
[00:52:28.562 --> 00:52:30.884]  Sorry, I'm a little late getting back on air.
[00:52:30.904 --> 00:52:35.266]  That was just a one-minute break as we joined some stations that don't carry that first little five minutes.
[00:52:36.067 --> 00:52:38.148]  That little hors d'oeuvres we do at the start of each hour.
[00:52:38.748 --> 00:52:41.770]  Some stations carry news, which is fake news most of the time.
[00:52:42.331 --> 00:52:44.432]  So a lot of stations want us to do the first five minutes.
[00:52:44.452 --> 00:52:46.413]  They can just have a few minutes of ads there or whatever.
[00:52:47.174 --> 00:52:57.050]   But I was talking to Roger Stone about Trump and Trump right now, if you know how to read the tea leaves what Roger said, I'll just I'm trying to steal thunder here.
[00:52:57.070 --> 00:53:04.353]  Trump is intending to declare his 2024 run on July 4th.
[00:53:04.754 --> 00:53:10.757]  Now, as Roger said, that's technical, tactical flexibility.
[00:53:11.517 --> 00:53:19.361]  Sorry, this is just, when you get a big giant kahuna news breaker like that, makes the little pitter patter get excited because I love to break big news.
[00:53:19.821 --> 00:53:25.805]   But as he said, It's like Elvis has got Marilyn Monroe in the bed and they're about to do the deed.
[00:53:25.845 --> 00:53:28.728]  Maybe Elvis decides he's a little tired, doesn't want to do it, and he turns the light out.
[00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:37.896]  So Trump is intending on July 4th to announce the 2024 run.
[00:53:38.216 --> 00:53:41.018]  You talk about blood coming out of the eyeballs of the left.
[00:53:44.481 --> 00:53:46.283]  You think they're upset about Roe v. Wade?
[00:53:46.303 --> 00:53:48.625]  The only thing they hate more than babies is Trump.
[00:53:50.242 --> 00:53:51.543]  So this is just insane.
[00:53:52.743 --> 00:53:54.944]  So I'm very glad I called Roger Stone today.
[00:53:54.964 --> 00:53:56.345]  And let me tell you, he's not a BSer.
[00:53:57.905 --> 00:54:00.827]  He tells you something, but here's the deal.
[00:54:01.967 --> 00:54:02.708]  You heard him say it.
[00:54:03.988 --> 00:54:12.772]  Trump may make a tactical decision or tactical flexibility not to announce July 4th.
[00:54:13.653 --> 00:54:20.540]   But as it stands right now, Trump is going to announce 2024 run This Monday.
[00:54:23.322 --> 00:54:33.046]  You know, I was thinking about taking off that day and hanging out with the Dews over at their house and their kids and my kids, or my five-year-old, all my other kids are basically grown up now.
[00:54:33.546 --> 00:54:34.987]  Man, life goes by fast, folks.
[00:54:35.007 --> 00:54:43.731]  Let me just warn you, if you're young, I'm still pretty young, but I feel young, but man, I got a 19-year-old son, an 18-year-old daughter, a 14-year-old daughter, and a five-year-old daughter.
[00:54:45.512 --> 00:54:49.274]  But, sorry, I'm kind of poleaxed right now by this news here.
[00:54:52.384 --> 00:54:53.405]  Absolutely insane.
[00:54:54.826 --> 00:54:56.627]  Plus this morning I was hiking on the Greenbelt.
[00:54:57.187 --> 00:54:59.008]  I find really cool fossils all the time.
[00:54:59.669 --> 00:55:04.132]  Sometimes these really big ancient conch shells and things that are huge, beautiful.
[00:55:04.172 --> 00:55:04.952]  My house is full of them.
[00:55:05.553 --> 00:55:08.194]  But I know how to look up in the cliffs and things and see their shape.
[00:55:09.015 --> 00:55:14.139]   So I'm hiking along this area and I look way up and I think, oh that's a That looks like a shell.
[00:55:14.179 --> 00:55:15.320]  That looks like a fossil.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:18.921]  Let me scrabble up that embankment up to that.
[00:55:18.941 --> 00:55:22.582]  Of course, it wasn't what I thought it was, but I've found those many times that way.
[00:55:23.522 --> 00:55:29.044]  I'm getting old here, and I blew my back out, kind of slipped and fell and slid down that thing a little bit.
[00:55:30.484 --> 00:55:35.226]  Feels like somebody's going to punch me right in the kidney right there, but I'm going to be fine.
[00:55:35.586 --> 00:55:41.568]  I took some Advil, but I'm just processing right now.
[00:55:43.544 --> 00:55:50.327]  Processing right now that Trump is gonna run and gonna announce on July 4th right now.
[00:55:51.167 --> 00:55:56.709]  It's like when somebody's got a gun to your head with the hammer back and their finger on the trigger and they've decided to blow your brains out.
[00:55:56.929 --> 00:56:02.131]  Now they might decide not to, but he's got it locked and loaded right now about to pull the trigger.
[00:56:03.172 --> 00:56:05.653]  And so that's where it's at.
[00:56:07.093 --> 00:56:08.794]  And that's a whole nother subject.
[00:56:08.874 --> 00:56:15.552]   In fact, We got Alex Stein who went to New York and the leftists protested him and tried to shut down his free speech.
[00:56:15.592 --> 00:56:19.656]  And we got incredible videos and the whole drag queen pedophile time situation.
[00:56:20.037 --> 00:56:20.958]  He's on this next hour.
[00:56:22.399 --> 00:56:24.461]  But I almost just want to clear the decks today.
[00:56:26.723 --> 00:56:30.827]  And, you know, maybe I need to come in tonight.
[00:56:30.988 --> 00:56:31.928]  I said I'd be doing this.
[00:56:32.884 --> 00:56:37.756]  And do a two, three hour live internet only show and take calls like we did Saturday.
[00:56:38.077 --> 00:56:39.199]  Boy, did that show get viral.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.763]  Million views on InfoWars.
[00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:49.474]  Half a million people tuned in audio-wise, just on the internet only, so that's a million and a half on our side, and then the video from it got picked up everywhere.
[00:56:49.795 --> 00:56:54.898]  Last count I had is over 20 million views of that show or segments of that show Saturday.
[00:56:55.318 --> 00:57:01.102]  Doesn't this crew feel great coming in, doing that with Savannah Hernandez and Drew Hernandez, and then knock it out of the park?
[00:57:01.842 --> 00:57:08.206]  What about getting Roger back tonight for an hour or two, if he can do it, and taking your calls?
[00:57:08.226 --> 00:57:11.296]   Because let me tell you, I talked to him during the break.
[00:57:11.817 --> 00:57:12.917]  He said, call me after the show.
[00:57:12.977 --> 00:57:14.058]  This is, yeah, this is big.
[00:57:14.978 --> 00:57:19.120]  And obviously you can put two and two together, but I'm like, is it the big guy?
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:23.221]  He had this big giant smile and he goes, yeah, call me, call me later.
[00:57:23.762 --> 00:57:33.126]  So as it is right now, ladies and gentlemen, Trump is declaring on July 4th, Trump is declaring on July 4th, 2022.
[00:57:33.566 --> 00:57:36.307]  How big of a gigantic whopper is that?
[00:57:37.355 --> 00:57:42.320]  And again, I can't stand what he did with the poison shots, but I love the Roe v. Wade.
[00:57:42.420 --> 00:57:43.621]  I love how he secured the border.
[00:57:43.661 --> 00:57:44.942]  I love how he showed up to China.
[00:57:45.423 --> 00:57:46.964]  I love how the dollar got strong.
[00:57:47.024 --> 00:57:48.546]  I love how he made his number one in energy.
[00:57:50.488 --> 00:57:51.669]  I mean, the list just goes on.
[00:57:51.689 --> 00:57:53.931]  I love how he got us out of the WHO.
[00:57:55.828 --> 00:57:56.829]  I mean, that's a big one right there.
[00:57:56.849 --> 00:57:58.991]  I mean, there were hundreds of things Trump did he meant well.
[00:57:59.371 --> 00:58:00.973]  And he believes in doctors, man.
[00:58:01.514 --> 00:58:07.079]  He really thinks, as they told him, that it's so scientific and this is going to stop it, sir, and we'll be able to reopen things.
[00:58:07.159 --> 00:58:09.321]  And by the way, I meant to cover that yesterday.
[00:58:09.341 --> 00:58:12.364]  I had video clips of it from National News.
[00:58:14.146 --> 00:58:19.891]  So you guys go into the list and pull me the articles and pull me the video and put it back on my desk so I can actually have it in front of me.
[00:58:19.911 --> 00:58:20.152]  Thanks.
[00:58:21.104 --> 00:58:23.125]  Poor crew's got to run around like chickens with their heads cut off.
[00:58:23.545 --> 00:58:25.046]  All the stuff I asked for, they do a great job.
[00:58:25.926 --> 00:58:44.913]  The EPA slash FDA board that is in between both agencies came out and they said, you know, we're just going to stop even doing trials or studies on things, said the FDA.
[00:58:46.494 --> 00:58:48.235]  And the CDC agreed, and so did the EPA.
[00:58:49.585 --> 00:58:52.686]  They said, we're just going to stop doing studies.
[00:58:53.707 --> 00:58:55.748]  We're not going to look, we're not going to have trials anymore.
[00:58:57.749 --> 00:58:59.129]  And we're just going to give people whatever we want.
[00:59:00.130 --> 00:59:13.675]  That's the revolution Fauci four years ago in that C-SPAN show, all those scientists and all those heads of agency said is, we're going to blow up the old system and have a system of where we just do whatever we want.
[00:59:13.975 --> 00:59:17.097]  And then there's no surveillance of what they're giving us to see what it's doing.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:19.721]  Can you believe that?
[00:59:22.162 --> 00:59:24.443]  Can you believe that?
[00:59:24.483 --> 00:59:25.323]  Yeah, they found the clips.
[00:59:25.383 --> 00:59:26.544]  In fact, there's a new one today.
[00:59:27.044 --> 00:59:28.985]  So there were two clips yesterday and a clip today.
[00:59:30.646 --> 00:59:32.347]  I mean, that alone should be the whole show.
[00:59:32.587 --> 00:59:33.787]  So see, here's my paradox.
[00:59:34.247 --> 00:59:35.388]  Here's my conundrum.
[00:59:36.548 --> 00:59:41.991]  Here's my point of really malfunctioning.
[00:59:43.131 --> 00:59:44.012]  I cannot compute.
[00:59:44.512 --> 00:59:45.172]  I want Trump.
[00:59:45.352 --> 00:59:46.053]  I don't want Biden.
[00:59:47.338 --> 00:59:48.299]  I don't want Governor Newsom.
[00:59:48.559 --> 00:59:49.799]  We know he'll be a hundred times better.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:52.841]  But he went along with this.
[00:59:54.042 --> 00:59:55.483]  And so did DeSantis early on.
[00:59:56.683 --> 00:59:59.145]  DeSantis, to his credit, has come out against it now.
[01:00:01.926 --> 01:00:03.867]  So that's a whole question for callers.
[01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:07.429]  I kind of suspend everything we're doing right now and just ask that question.
[01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.771]  What do we do when Trump, right now he said he's doing it.
[01:00:12.652 --> 01:00:18.831]   Like he intends to declare he's running for president on Monday, according to a little
[01:00:18.831 --> 01:00:21.251]  bird.
[01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:27.170]   So he may change that, but sooner rather than later, things are really hot politically right
[01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:30.652]  now, the Roe v. Wade, the January 6 circus.
[01:00:30.652 --> 01:00:34.851]   Once he declares himself president, all the reckless attempts to declare him mentally
[01:00:34.851 --> 01:00:43.932]   ill and insane aren't going to work anymore because you can't indict somebody who's running
[01:00:44.816 --> 01:00:47.718]  That's the Justice Department rule, because then it becomes too obvious.
[01:00:48.078 --> 01:00:53.722]  So doesn't that make absolutely perfect sense?
[01:00:58.265 --> 01:00:59.265]  I'll make this decision.
[01:00:59.445 --> 01:01:01.047]  I never tell Owen Schroer what to do.
[01:01:01.627 --> 01:01:04.269]  He has a great instinct, great talk show host, better than me in many ways.
[01:01:05.054 --> 01:01:06.975]  But once a year, I say I never.
[01:01:07.795 --> 01:01:10.636]  Once a year, I saw a call and go, hey, obviously you're going to be covering this, right?
[01:01:11.016 --> 01:01:12.297]  He's always like, yeah, I'm already on it.
[01:01:12.357 --> 01:01:12.837]  I'm doing that.
[01:01:12.877 --> 01:01:14.597]  So I don't need to call Owen.
[01:01:15.678 --> 01:01:16.258]  His head's in the game.
[01:01:16.278 --> 01:01:19.819]  He's probably listening right now while he's boxing or lifting weights or playing basketball.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.040]  Literally listens while he does all that.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.240]  Sports fiend.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.341]  I wish I was in that great shape.
[01:01:25.862 --> 01:01:32.688]  Obviously, Owen's gonna be covering Trump 2024 announcement coming on Monday for his whole three hours today, 3 to 6 p.m.
[01:01:33.409 --> 01:01:36.872]  I got some meetings I gotta be in, but by 4 or 5 I could be on the show too.
[01:01:37.753 --> 01:01:41.216]  Or maybe I just suspend all the news I was about to cover and cover this now and take your calls.
[01:01:41.516 --> 01:01:42.417]  What do you think, folks?
[01:01:42.738 --> 01:01:45.540]  We'll talk about it when we come back, but I'm just blown away by this.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.462]  Trump's gonna announce on Monday!
[01:01:47.482 --> 01:01:49.364]  Alright, here's what's going on.
[01:01:50.757 --> 01:01:55.821]  I have massive economic news that will affect every one of us bigger than anything we've ever experienced.
[01:01:56.341 --> 01:02:14.075]  If you think inflation's bad right now, I mean, I shudder in anger at myself that I am not running around 24-7 myself, getting prepared, getting ready, which I'm already somewhat prepared, but that's my flesh.
[01:02:14.796 --> 01:02:16.738]  My flesh is smart, but it's also weak.
[01:02:17.745 --> 01:02:21.169]  Because it thinks about itself and says, you get ready, you protect yourself.
[01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:25.914]  But if I don't use the spirit that's more powerful, light year is more powerful.
[01:02:27.529 --> 01:02:36.175]  And fight the tyranny, and stand against it, then all the horrible stuff will happen, and then some, and then it won't matter how prepared I get.
[01:02:36.215 --> 01:02:36.716]  You understand?
[01:02:37.356 --> 01:02:38.217]  That's the paradox.
[01:02:38.237 --> 01:02:49.345]  You gotta spend, in my experience, the vast majority of your time fighting to stop evil, fighting to expose it, and then some time being prepared.
[01:02:50.926 --> 01:02:57.658]   But we've entered the season now, Where it's not about stopping it anymore, it's about getting prepared more and more.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.942]  So I was going to get to this big Brexit report.
[01:03:01.962 --> 01:03:03.963]  We'll actually play it at the start of the next segment.
[01:03:04.003 --> 01:03:04.984]  It's so powerful.
[01:03:05.845 --> 01:03:09.748]  BRICS Announces New World Reserve Currency As America Commits Economic Suicide.
[01:03:09.928 --> 01:03:11.229]  It's a perfect headline by Greg Rees.
[01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:13.130]  Look, I love my whole crew.
[01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:13.951]  They're all amazing.
[01:03:13.991 --> 01:03:17.454]  I mean, Darren McBrain and all of them are as smart as I am are smarter.
[01:03:17.834 --> 01:03:22.518]  Greg Rees is like every one of his reports is a grand slam out of the park.
[01:03:23.971 --> 01:03:25.792]  Muhammad Ali meets Babe Ruth.
[01:03:25.912 --> 01:03:27.332]  I mean, it's just, it's ridiculous.
[01:03:28.012 --> 01:03:29.233]  But he's on target.
[01:03:30.313 --> 01:03:31.614]  It's posted at Infowars.com.
[01:03:31.794 --> 01:03:34.115]  We're going to play that at the start of the next segment.
[01:03:34.555 --> 01:03:37.876]  And then I'm going to take 10 phone calls ahead of Alex Stein.
[01:03:38.576 --> 01:03:41.497]  And then when he leaves us, if you're still on hold, I'll get to you, but I don't want to keep everybody on hold.
[01:03:42.097 --> 01:03:44.298]  Alex Stein is going to be joining us, but I want to take 10 phone calls.
[01:03:44.418 --> 01:03:45.779]  Please don't load 20 up, guys.
[01:03:46.699 --> 01:03:50.700]  Because if we do that, then, you know, I won't get to them all.
[01:03:51.741 --> 01:03:55.033]   But I'm going to take Ten phone calls.
[01:03:55.053 --> 01:03:56.253]  We're not going to open the phones up yet.
[01:03:56.273 --> 01:03:59.055]  We're going to open them up, start the next segment.
[01:04:01.797 --> 01:04:25.977]   And we're going to take ten phone calls on what do you think on this Wednesday, June 29th broadcast directly from someone that talked to Donald John Trump that he is right now saying he's looking to announce, he thinks he's going to announce on July 4th, In five days.
[01:04:27.819 --> 01:04:28.920]  That is seismic.
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:35.506]  Whether you hate Trump, whether you're neutral on Trump, whether you love Trump, that is so gigantic.
[01:04:37.168 --> 01:04:38.969]  That is so incredibly seismic.
[01:04:39.730 --> 01:04:42.453]  And we'll get Alex Stein's take on that as well and take calls while he's on.
[01:04:45.126 --> 01:04:47.207]  So, rack up 15 calls.
[01:04:47.868 --> 01:04:49.028]  Our phone system takes 20.
[01:04:49.529 --> 01:04:51.870]  I just, I don't want anybody left behind.
[01:04:52.150 --> 01:04:56.073]  And hey, I did as good a job yesterday as I did 20 years ago.
[01:04:56.393 --> 01:05:01.936]  In 20 years, I haven't gotten back to where I was my first six, seven years of talk radio, where I could take 30, 40 phone calls an hour.
[01:05:02.256 --> 01:05:03.637]  We did it yesterday.
[01:05:03.757 --> 01:05:04.498]  I shut up.
[01:05:04.918 --> 01:05:06.859]  I got the callers on and moved the next person.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:09.140]  That means you got to get to your point.
[01:05:10.381 --> 01:05:11.782]  So I'm going to give you the toll free number.
[01:05:13.592 --> 01:05:18.174]  When we come back, for first-time callers today, you're 60 seconds on.
[01:05:18.274 --> 01:05:20.615]  What do you think of the exclusive?
[01:05:21.414 --> 01:05:23.414]  And I'm not as excited as a such a big exclusive.
[01:05:23.414 --> 01:05:31.894]  The ramifications of it are wild.
[01:05:32.059 --> 01:05:34.620]  What are the ramifications of Trump running?
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:47.940]   Because they're trying to put him in prison and he knows that if he announces his run, Whatever they cook up or do, historically they cannot indict someone who is prominent, who's already been president, and who's running for president again.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:58.622]  This is so big and I hope Trump, just to freak these people out and drive them into the ground, he also sees the sand in Poles starting to eclipsing.
[01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:00.902]  Oh yeah, all the planets have aligned.
[01:06:01.343 --> 01:06:07.487]   Trump right now is planning to announce His second run for president of the United States.
[01:06:07.847 --> 01:06:10.528]  Only guy that never ran for office and became president first time.
[01:06:10.548 --> 01:06:15.129]  Except Abraham Lincoln.
[01:06:17.649 --> 01:06:24.190]  Did Abraham Lincoln, I forget his... Did Abraham Lincoln ever hold office before he became president?
[01:06:24.210 --> 01:06:27.671]  I think he was a prominent lawyer that just won.
[01:06:27.711 --> 01:06:30.071]  I think he's the only... Guys, look up Abraham Lincoln.
[01:06:30.391 --> 01:06:30.711]  Look up.
[01:06:31.012 --> 01:06:33.292]  Just give me the encyclopedia on him.
[01:06:34.830 --> 01:06:35.530]  His political career?
[01:06:37.851 --> 01:06:38.051]  Wow.
[01:06:38.872 --> 01:06:43.974]  So if I seem distracted right now, I am completely distracted by the ramifications of this.
[01:06:44.034 --> 01:06:45.574]  I mean, this is a big deal.
[01:06:46.054 --> 01:06:47.415]  You don't need me telling you that.
[01:06:48.235 --> 01:06:54.378]  And you don't need me to tell you that whatever happens with Trump or DeSantis or any of this, you need us to be on air fighting harder than ever.
[01:06:55.546 --> 01:07:08.000]  At a point where our talking points that I developed from research and the Holy Spirit and understanding and callers and guests and a fusion of all this together, immersed in this 20 hours a day, 18 hours a day.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.762]  Some days 20 hours a day.
[01:07:10.943 --> 01:07:11.323]  Most days 15.
[01:07:11.423 --> 01:07:14.307]  I've learned to cut back or I go completely insane.
[01:07:17.315 --> 01:07:20.078]  They don't want this brain trust, this spirit trust on air.
[01:07:20.538 --> 01:07:23.381]  They want to get to you, and they got to get through us to get to you.
[01:07:23.721 --> 01:07:26.003]  They want to get to my children, they got to get through me first.
[01:07:26.384 --> 01:07:28.746]  They want to get to your family, they got to get through you first.
[01:07:29.006 --> 01:07:34.291]  And I'm telling you, I'm on record, the one thing I want to do is beat these Satanists, and I don't back off 1%.
[01:07:35.012 --> 01:07:37.434]  I am full-on war with these people.
[01:07:37.694 --> 01:07:41.378]  But I need your backing if you want me to go in there and stomp the living hell out of these people.
[01:07:42.099 --> 01:07:51.588]  So I want you to go now to InfoWarsTore.com as you've done before and gotten great products that enrich you, that enrich us, that we 360 win together and build our community of victory now!
[01:07:52.990 --> 01:07:57.795]  We have a July 4th Super Sale that starts today and we'll run through next Wednesday and I gotta tell you the good news.
[01:07:58.135 --> 01:07:59.356]  This is the best prices ever.
[01:07:59.817 --> 01:08:02.179]  The bad news is a bunch of this stuff is sold out.
[01:08:02.459 --> 01:08:05.823]  We're not even sure we're gonna get it again but we gotta have the money now.
[01:08:07.512 --> 01:08:15.345]  So we have Super Female Vitality Cold Press Compounded Herbs that are known to supercharge vitality in women, including libido.
[01:08:15.685 --> 01:08:17.428]  It's an incredible product.
[01:08:17.889 --> 01:08:22.376]  That and the super powerful Ionine Surface Spray, the strongest thing out there known.
[01:08:23.376 --> 01:08:26.176]  knocks out anything in seconds on services.
[01:08:26.176 --> 01:08:32.496]   Both of those, ladies and gentlemen, are 60% off with double Patriot points.
[01:08:32.496 --> 01:08:36.815]   And then hair and beard formula, which I'll just be honest, it's been a terrible seller.
[01:08:36.815 --> 01:08:41.255]   We got 20,000 bottles of it and nobody wants to buy it, nobody likes it, and guys that have beards
[01:08:41.255 --> 01:08:44.255]  think they don't need that kind of crap with our audience.
[01:08:44.255 --> 01:08:49.695]   It's a super vitamin mineral, high-end multivitamin mineral that kids could take,
[01:08:49.695 --> 01:08:51.574]  old people, young people, you name it.
[01:08:51.621 --> 01:08:54.184]  I'm tempted to pull the labels off of it and just say multivitamin on it.
[01:08:54.584 --> 01:08:58.227]  We can't keep the multivitamin stock, and quite frankly, that's what I said when we got this in.
[01:08:58.247 --> 01:09:01.290]  I said, this is a better formula than our multivitamin, which is incredible.
[01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:03.052]  This one's a little bit better.
[01:09:03.894 --> 01:09:10.040]  So, the Herb Beer Formula is an amazing multivitamin mineral for your immune system, your body, and we can't sell the damn thing.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.302]  It costs us more per bottle.
[01:09:12.342 --> 01:09:14.063]  It's high-end than what we're selling it for.
[01:09:14.284 --> 01:09:15.985]  We're clearing that sucker out right now.
[01:09:16.005 --> 01:09:19.669]  75% off with double-paid three points at infowarestore.com.

[01:09:45.987 --> 01:09:47.947]  Prostagard, Ultimate Fish Oil, Vazobee.
[01:09:48.187 --> 01:09:56.170]  We're blowing everything out right now because we're like a locomotive firing up that engine to go full power and I don't care what happens is up to God now.
[01:09:56.410 --> 01:10:01.512]  I'm throwing it all in against them and going head-to-head with these people and you're backing me and I love you.
[01:10:02.210 --> 01:10:07.015]  All right, we're going to take your phone calls right through the next hour, riding shotgun with Alex Stein.
[01:10:07.055 --> 01:10:10.899]  He'll love to take your phone calls because I'm not going to preempt him for this big news.
[01:10:10.939 --> 01:10:12.120]  He'll just ride along with us.
[01:10:13.221 --> 01:10:16.484]  Roger Stone earlier on air, I said, when is Trump going to announce?
[01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:18.446]  Because he told Roger and others he's going to run.
[01:10:18.486 --> 01:10:19.968]  I told you that six, seven months ago.
[01:10:20.368 --> 01:10:21.209]  Trump changed his mind.
[01:10:21.229 --> 01:10:22.190]  They mess with him too much.
[01:10:23.711 --> 01:10:24.993]  Does he not have fun as president?
[01:10:25.013 --> 01:10:26.034]  Let me tell you, he busts his ass.
[01:10:27.529 --> 01:10:33.433]  And now because of them messing with him in America and what he sees going on, this is what he said, he's going to run.
[01:10:33.453 --> 01:10:35.094]  And I said, when is that announcement?
[01:10:35.594 --> 01:10:48.602]  And a little bird in Florida, right where Roger lives, down the street from Trump, told Roger that Trump's looking at Monday, July 4th.
[01:10:48.762 --> 01:10:49.663]  That is a big deal.
[01:10:49.703 --> 01:10:51.364]  I want to take your calls on that subject.
[01:10:53.382 --> 01:10:56.083]  On that subject alone, for first-time callers, 877-789-2539.
[01:10:56.103 --> 01:10:56.403]  877-789-Alex.
[01:10:56.423 --> 01:10:56.563]  877-789-2539.
[01:10:56.423 --> 01:10:59.663]   seven seven eight nine two five three nine eight seven seven seven eight nine
[01:10:59.663 --> 01:11:06.144]   Alex eight seven seven seven eight nine two five three nine on that subject and
[01:11:06.144 --> 01:11:10.470]   that subject alone please only call it on that subject We love you.
[01:11:10.490 --> 01:11:13.412]  We usually have open free-for-all like yesterday for two hours.
[01:11:13.432 --> 01:11:14.033]  It was amazing.
[01:11:14.113 --> 01:11:15.073]  I love the free-for-all.
[01:11:15.113 --> 01:11:15.854]  Love the wild card.
[01:11:16.274 --> 01:11:17.555]  Today is not a wild card.
[01:11:17.615 --> 01:11:22.058]  Today is one topic and one topic only and that is Trump 2024.
[01:11:22.958 --> 01:11:23.559]  Are you for it?
[01:11:23.599 --> 01:11:24.219]  Are you against it?
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.040]  What do you think?
[01:11:25.340 --> 01:11:26.861]  Because you're hearing tomorrow's news today.
[01:11:27.141 --> 01:11:29.303]  Now, he calls it tactical flexibility.
[01:11:29.963 --> 01:11:38.389]  He may not announce it Monday, but as of now, Trump is intending to announce on Monday global exclusive.
[01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:40.731]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:11:41.211 --> 01:11:42.312]  Next week's news today.
[01:11:42.332 --> 01:11:43.413]  877-789-2539.
[01:11:43.453 --> 01:11:50.760]  Here is the insane report I was going to spend most of the hour on, but we're going to take your calls now.
[01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:52.502]  BRICS announcement.
[01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:56.205]  New world reserve currency as America commits economic suicide.
[01:11:56.586 --> 01:12:01.050]  Greg Reese, the video report is at Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:02.971]  You need to share it if you want to stop this.
[01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:03.791]  Here it is.
[01:12:03.791 --> 01:12:06.371]  (upbeat music)
[01:12:06.371 --> 01:12:18.671]   China has recently invited Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran, Egypt, and several other countries to join BRICS,
[01:12:18.671 --> 01:12:26.130]   a growing world alliance led by Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa.
[01:12:26.793 --> 01:12:32.934]  While some are reporting that BRICS is somehow challenging the globalists, this is demonstrably false.
[01:12:33.915 --> 01:12:39.136]  The original concept for BRICS was proposed by the chief economist for Goldman Sachs.
[01:12:39.916 --> 01:12:45.957]  BRICS's New Development Bank is staffed by known players of the IMF and World Bank.
[01:12:46.618 --> 01:12:51.459]  And BRICS has repeatedly affirmed their commitment to the United Nations Agenda 2030.
[01:12:53.239 --> 01:13:09.082]  Aside from Brazil's President Bolsonaro, all of BRICS nation-states have pushed the COVID-19 lockdowns and experimental shots, and China recently announced five more years of their brutal zero-COVID lockdowns.
[01:13:10.322 --> 01:13:17.904]  BRICS is also pushing a digital currency and has launched a Vaccine Research and Development Center for member states.
[01:13:19.207 --> 01:13:21.650]  BRICS is clearly not anti-globalist.
[01:13:22.191 --> 01:13:28.740]  Even the CCP's state-run media explains how BRICS now leads the globalization mission.
[01:13:29.761 --> 01:13:33.526]  But they are all turning against the United States and its allies.
[01:13:34.387 --> 01:13:36.349]  Xi Jinping accused the U.S.
[01:13:36.489 --> 01:13:44.537]  of weaponizing the financial system with their sanctions against Russia, which has caused the average person to suffer worldwide.
[01:13:45.118 --> 01:13:50.263]  And Vladimir Putin suggested that BRICS could provide a new world reserve currency.
[01:13:51.404 --> 01:13:52.465]  At the recent St.
[01:13:52.565 --> 01:14:03.855]  Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin blamed the West for disrupting the international economy and announced that NATO's unipolar world order is over.
[01:14:04.676 --> 01:14:13.864]  In just three months, Russia has managed to reverse inflation and has increased their financial surplus to more than four times it was last year.
[01:14:14.605 --> 01:14:23.095]  Russia is now thriving and Putin announced that their international priority is to increase food deliveries to countries that need it the most.
[01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:33.346]  They are pouring billions into their farming communities, raised the minimum wage by 10% and provided more money to pensioners and families with children.
[01:14:34.427 --> 01:14:47.380]  He also criticized the West for choosing an economic suicidal path and having suicidal intentions, which seems to be the only explanation for what the Biden administration is doing.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:56.748]  They have deliberately cut off our fuel, which will cut off our food, and they are pushing the deadly shots for every single healthy child in America.
[01:14:57.829 --> 01:15:06.341]  They have opened our borders and are pushing for a world war with a thriving nuclear power while destroying our military from within.
[01:15:06.361 --> 01:15:09.865]  The Biden administration's plan is clear.
[01:15:10.386 --> 01:15:12.569]  Destroy America from within.
[01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:17.911]  And they have amassed an army of the miserable through mass psychosis.
[01:15:18.631 --> 01:15:27.294]  An army of ugly, insane, sexually obsessed deviants who want abortion on demand and acceptance for pedophiles.
[01:15:28.054 --> 01:15:31.875]  Psychotics who castrate their own children because it's trendy.
[01:15:32.355 --> 01:15:36.316]  And mindless drones who believe the human race needs to die.
[01:15:37.276 --> 01:15:44.942]  At what point will Americans begin to care enough to work together and do something when the nuclear bombs start falling?
[01:15:46.063 --> 01:15:53.870]  America is being mass-murdered by our own federal government, and the emerging new globalized economy will let it happen.
[01:15:54.871 --> 01:16:00.455]  Unless Americans take back control of their own government, America will soon end.
[01:16:01.116 --> 01:16:04.358]  That's the plan being executed right now.
[01:16:05.959 --> 01:16:07.960]  For InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:16:10.942 --> 01:16:13.163]  All right, my friends.
[01:16:14.243 --> 01:16:16.104]  What a time to be live on air, man.
[01:16:16.164 --> 01:16:17.144]  It's all coming down.
[01:16:18.185 --> 01:16:19.265]  It's all going down.
[01:16:21.006 --> 01:16:21.326]  Wow.
[01:16:22.267 --> 01:16:23.567]  I am so torn right now.
[01:16:24.768 --> 01:16:27.189]  And I know the inside scoop on Trump.
[01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:28.730]  I know he means well.
[01:16:30.551 --> 01:16:33.472]  But he really screwed the pooch on this poison shot.
[01:16:34.761 --> 01:16:36.682]  But everything else he did was so damn good.
[01:16:37.463 --> 01:16:39.504]  And I want him to run.
[01:16:39.524 --> 01:16:42.186]  I want him to get in their face.
[01:16:42.326 --> 01:16:43.426]  I want to see their reaction.
[01:16:43.947 --> 01:16:45.067]  But I've also got concerns.
[01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:45.888]  And no way!
[01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:51.851]  Nothing we can do will help focus that than a large discussion.
[01:16:52.152 --> 01:16:53.032]  So I promise you this.
[01:16:53.052 --> 01:16:53.813]  Today's Wednesday.
[01:16:54.213 --> 01:16:55.954]  You better bet your bottom peso.
[01:16:56.714 --> 01:16:57.555]  Your bottom shekel.
[01:16:57.595 --> 01:16:58.235]  Your bottom ruble.
[01:16:58.275 --> 01:16:59.316]  Your bottom pound.
[01:16:59.336 --> 01:17:00.056]  Your bottom dollar.
[01:17:00.096 --> 01:17:02.017]  Your bottom euro or yen or yon.
[01:17:02.818 --> 01:17:04.059]  Your bottom money.
[01:17:05.128 --> 01:17:09.012]  That we'll be talking about this on Thursday, Friday and right through the weekend.
[01:17:09.232 --> 01:17:14.217]  And I am going to come in here on Saturday and do a big special live show for three, four hours with no breaks.
[01:17:15.038 --> 01:17:17.200]  And then I got to do it.
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.682]  I promised to spend time with my family.
[01:17:18.702 --> 01:17:20.043]  I'm going to take off Sunday and Monday.
[01:17:20.063 --> 01:17:23.907]  We'll have some great rebroadcast for you there, unless something even bigger happens.
[01:17:24.127 --> 01:17:26.210]  I'll be in here, but the crew needs a little respite as well.
[01:17:27.225 --> 01:17:30.407]  Can't can't drive these horses, you know, too hard myself included.
[01:17:30.847 --> 01:17:35.029]  So that's coming up, but we're going to be taking your phone calls start of the next segment.
[01:17:36.630 --> 01:17:50.758]  We're going to be talking to Adam and honey and Joel and Sally and Dave and Matt and Brandon and James and Liberty and Neil and everybody else and then right in the next hour with Alex Stein, he'll understand he'll ride shotgun with us, but he's been doing some great things as well.
[01:17:51.399 --> 01:17:54.701]  And as the left really coming after him, but I'm going to remind you that.
[01:17:55.643 --> 01:18:03.625]  We have this big July 4th special running right now as low as 75% off on products that are amazing.
[01:18:04.925 --> 01:18:07.826]  Those products being sold at 75% off are below cost.
[01:18:08.406 --> 01:18:09.626]  I gotta get the money in here.
[01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:14.827]  We got huge donations a few months ago that I thought would put us way in the black.
[01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:19.443]   We had such big bills and problems that we would be Done.
[01:18:19.503 --> 01:18:24.368]  If I sold everything I had, we'd be laying half the crew off right now and imploding.
[01:18:24.628 --> 01:18:26.511]  But thanks to that donor and thanks to all of you.
[01:18:26.531 --> 01:18:28.953]  Because all the little donations and purchases worked as well.
[01:18:29.994 --> 01:18:30.634]  We'd be screwed.
[01:18:31.235 --> 01:18:32.776]  But I've learned how God works.
[01:18:33.677 --> 01:18:38.200]  If I don't fight as hard as I can, then right when I'm down to nothing, God won't come through.
[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:41.001]  Because God's like, well, you didn't put 110% in, son.
[01:18:42.022 --> 01:18:44.164]  So that's why God always waits for the last moment.
[01:18:44.724 --> 01:18:45.585]  God trusted you.
[01:18:45.625 --> 01:18:46.905]  He trusted me to do the right thing.
[01:18:46.965 --> 01:18:48.647]  And then if you take action, God will bless us.
[01:18:49.207 --> 01:18:50.388]  It goes back to the widow's mind.
[01:18:51.684 --> 01:19:00.528]  So we have 40% off knockout sleep support, alpha power, living defense plus, whole food, multivitamin, pollen blocks, survival shield x2, all Dr. Jones natural products that are amazing.

[01:19:05.730 --> 01:19:07.190]  That's at cost by the way with the krill oil.
[01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:08.071]  That's the highest grade.

[01:19:09.771 --> 01:19:10.471]  Everybody should be on it.

[01:19:12.418 --> 01:19:14.339]  Alright, Alex Stein has been on fire.

[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:41.679]   then as we are about to do now and so let's go to the first call as the orders
[01:19:41.679 --> 01:19:45.120]  and the calls were received.
[01:19:44.993 --> 01:19:48.935]  Let's go ahead and talk to Adam in Texas.
[01:19:49.055 --> 01:19:49.935]  Adam, you're on the air.
[01:19:49.975 --> 01:19:50.315]  Go ahead.
[01:19:51.476 --> 01:19:52.336]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:19:52.597 --> 01:19:52.917]  Good, Brian.
[01:19:52.937 --> 01:19:59.920]  I know a thank you isn't as strong without a handshake and eye contact, but I appreciate everything you've done.
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:07.164]  I've been listening to you since you were first on Coast to Coast, and I think I've been taking X2 and some of the other products since you first started.
[01:20:08.072 --> 01:20:09.493]  Thanks for keeping us on air, brother.
[01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:10.373]  I appreciate you, Adam.
[01:20:10.733 --> 01:20:14.375]  So what do you make of Trump set to announce Monday 2024 run?
[01:20:14.435 --> 01:20:21.838]  Well, I tried to be quick on calling you so that I would be first because I've got to say it.
[01:20:22.578 --> 01:20:32.846]   Obviously, like y'all said, it is only play in this particular moment, you know, to stop kind of puppet kangaroo court stuff going on.
[01:20:32.846 --> 01:20:36.565]  It's definitely his strongest play.
[01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:38.246]  I'm going to be honest.
[01:20:38.246 --> 01:20:47.086]   I think America needs to decide before anything like him running what our next actual president,
[01:20:47.086 --> 01:20:52.166]   who they need to be, because this is the most important decision, really, of the future
[01:20:52.166 --> 01:20:53.006]  of our country.
[01:20:53.352 --> 01:20:55.293]  We cannot afford to be wrong again.
[01:20:55.753 --> 01:21:03.756]  And though I would take Trump over almost anyone who has been president in the last 20 something years and probably even farther back.
[01:21:04.356 --> 01:21:14.300]  We need someone who really understands the war game and the problems that these people are going to bring to him once and if.
[01:21:14.835 --> 01:21:20.861]  We get a good president and it's going to be, you know, it's going to be the attacks as they went on Trump first.
[01:21:21.081 --> 01:21:26.706]  And it's going to be that all out until whatever comes down the pike next.
[01:21:27.707 --> 01:21:28.668]  It's going to be real rough.
[01:21:29.522 --> 01:21:30.142]  You're right, brother.
[01:21:30.202 --> 01:21:31.603]  I hear you, and God bless you, Adam.
[01:21:31.923 --> 01:21:33.443]  Let's talk to Liberty in Texas.
[01:21:34.064 --> 01:21:38.325]  Imminent announcement of Trump 2024 run July 4th is the inside word.
[01:21:38.345 --> 01:21:44.888]  He may change it via a tactical flexibility, but currently Trump will announce next Monday his 2024 run.
[01:21:45.248 --> 01:21:46.969]  Liberty, what do you make of this exclusive news?
[01:21:48.249 --> 01:21:48.569]  Hey, Alex.
[01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:50.250]  I really appreciate everything you've done.
[01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:51.090]  You woke me up.
[01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:52.811]  You're doing a great job.
[01:21:52.831 --> 01:21:55.132]  My heart goes out to you for everything you've done.
[01:21:55.352 --> 01:21:56.252]  I appreciate you.
[01:21:56.332 --> 01:21:57.312]  Your phone's a little muddy.
[01:21:57.372 --> 01:21:58.653]  Get up close to that receiver.
[01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:04.897]  Yeah, Alex, man, I'm not too keen on Trump.
[01:22:04.998 --> 01:22:08.941]  I'm more on a DeSantis or NTG, and I think they would be the best choice.
[01:22:08.961 --> 01:22:15.707]  Him being pro-vaccine is just not, you know, set well with me and a lot of other listeners.
[01:22:16.127 --> 01:22:17.808]  But I just think it's a bad choice.
[01:22:18.729 --> 01:22:23.133]  And then to run DeSantis or someone else is probably a better choice, I would think.
[01:22:24.488 --> 01:22:30.913]  That's why I wanted your view on this, but you see how them putting him under pressure and doing this would push him into it.
[01:22:31.253 --> 01:22:33.215]  So, why do they want to push Trump into doing this?
[01:22:34.896 --> 01:22:42.382]  Because I believe, like the other caller said, it's probably his best play and, you know, Roger feels the same way.
[01:22:42.402 --> 01:22:46.725]  We'll see how time goes out, but I personally will be voting for him.
[01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:47.806]  God bless Alex.
[01:22:48.547 --> 01:22:49.548]  God bless you, Liberty.
[01:22:49.648 --> 01:22:50.769]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:22:51.209 --> 01:22:52.871]  Let's talk to a caller in North Carolina.
[01:22:52.911 --> 01:22:53.811]  Let's talk to Neil.
[01:22:53.851 --> 01:22:54.852]  Neil, thanks for calling.
[01:22:54.872 --> 01:22:55.213]  Go ahead.
[01:22:56.934 --> 01:22:58.155]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:22:58.195 --> 01:23:09.404]  Hey, first of all, I'd like to say that no one would like to see Trump declare faster than the media because it will boost their ratings skyrocketing again.
[01:23:10.185 --> 01:23:13.608]  Secondly, it's a two-edged sword if he runs again.
[01:23:14.307 --> 01:23:19.427]   in a positive manner, he can illuminate the positive things that he did and the negative
[01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:23.358]  things that are happening because of what Biden has done.
[01:23:23.358 --> 01:23:26.567]   That's right, it'll give them a bully pulpit no matter what they do to destroy Biden, yeah,
[01:23:26.567 --> 01:23:27.507]  that's why I love it.
[01:23:27.507 --> 01:23:35.108]   Yeah, and I think on the flip side, they could just hammer him so hard that they can just
[01:23:35.108 --> 01:23:40.467]   distract from what's going on in the country with the border and inflation and stuff like that.
[01:23:40.636 --> 01:23:44.798]  So it's a two-headed snake.
[01:23:45.018 --> 01:23:46.798]  You're talking about how divisive he is.
[01:23:47.478 --> 01:23:48.319]  That's the downside.
[01:23:48.399 --> 01:23:49.439]  It'll energize the left.
[01:23:49.979 --> 01:23:53.501]  Just like for the midterms, Roe v. Wade energizes the left.
[01:23:53.521 --> 01:23:54.761]  Trump will energize the left.
[01:23:56.482 --> 01:24:05.689]   Well, I think that he will energize the left, but I think The middle of the country, the people that are suffering, paying $100 to fill up their car for gas.
[01:24:05.709 --> 01:24:09.191]  They're seeing these people coming in, flooding over the border.
[01:24:10.192 --> 01:24:11.973]  Inflation on everything else that they're buying.
[01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:15.055]  I think that's been overwhelming, just like it overwhelmed Jimmy Carter.
[01:24:15.375 --> 01:24:19.318]  And you might see Trump win 45 or 50 states.
[01:24:19.838 --> 01:24:21.039]  I agree with you, Neil.
[01:24:21.239 --> 01:24:22.360]  Crazy time to be alive.
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:22.900]  Thank you, sir.
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.802]  Let's talk to James in Ohio.
[01:24:24.842 --> 01:24:25.622]  James, you're on the air.
[01:24:27.083 --> 01:24:28.324]  Hey Alex, God bless you, brother.
[01:24:30.322 --> 01:24:31.443]  What do you think is about to go down?
[01:24:31.283 --> 01:24:32.283]  What's your view on this?
[01:24:32.283 --> 01:24:37.202]   Well, as a former Trump staffer, Alex, I was actually a guest on your show a few
[01:24:37.202 --> 01:24:38.202]  years ago.
[01:24:38.202 --> 01:24:45.483]   I think he's gotta announce as soon as possible just to get the wolves away from his door.
[01:24:45.483 --> 01:24:47.962]   But he has to do one thing that's critical, and you've said it.
[01:24:47.962 --> 01:24:51.682]  He has to come out and lay out the case against the vaccine.
[01:24:51.682 --> 01:24:57.682]   I mean, his number one most resilient trait is that he never accepts guilt, that he doesn't
[01:24:57.682 --> 01:24:58.962]  listen to the attacks.
[01:24:58.962 --> 01:25:00.962]  He just denies, denies, denies.
[01:25:01.352 --> 01:25:10.857]  It would be so impactful if he just came out, filmed a long-form video, and said, laid out the evidence, said, hey, I was fooled on this, this is my one big mistake.
[01:25:11.057 --> 01:25:13.898]  And put it on to the Democrats, and put it on to Fauci, exactly.
[01:25:14.338 --> 01:25:18.300]  Oh yeah, throw Fauci under the bus, throw the Democrats, throw Big Pharma under the bus.
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:27.704]   I mean, that would be, look, Ross Perot in the early 90s, They wouldn't give him any publicity, so he bought airtime on networks and local markets.
[01:25:28.304 --> 01:25:29.624]  Trump could very easily do that.
[01:25:30.364 --> 01:25:31.245]  He did infomercials.
[01:25:31.285 --> 01:25:33.685]  Filmed an hour-long infomercial just laying out the KDP information.
[01:25:33.785 --> 01:25:36.565]  And by the way, those Perot infomercials had the highest ratings ever.
[01:25:37.586 --> 01:25:37.786]  Right.
[01:25:37.886 --> 01:25:47.347]  And if I was in the room with Trump, which I've been in the room with Trump, somebody needs to lay this out to him and quit just being yes-men and saying, yes, Warped Speedy was great.
[01:25:47.387 --> 01:25:48.248]  We're so proud of you.
[01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:49.848]  It was a defining moment of your presidency.
[01:25:49.928 --> 01:25:50.648]  No, it wasn't.
[01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:54.248]  Mr. Trump, you have to right this wrong if you want to win.
[01:25:54.268 --> 01:25:55.849]  I mean, there's issues with DeSantis, too.
[01:25:56.209 --> 01:25:58.590]  I'm tired of, let's take the bloom off the rose there.
[01:25:58.630 --> 01:26:00.210]  There's red flag walls in Florida.
[01:26:00.351 --> 01:26:01.571]  He does nothing to stop them.
[01:26:02.731 --> 01:26:04.392]  Do we know anything about his foreign policy?
[01:26:04.972 --> 01:26:08.173]  He's given indications that he might be a hawk or even a neocon.
[01:26:08.294 --> 01:26:13.195]  So, I need to hear more from Ron before... Ah, great points, brother.
[01:26:13.215 --> 01:26:13.956]  Good to hear from you.
[01:26:13.976 --> 01:26:14.716]  I appreciate you.
[01:26:15.216 --> 01:26:16.257]  Selly in New York.
[01:26:16.277 --> 01:26:16.877]  You're on the air.
[01:26:16.917 --> 01:26:17.237]  Welcome.
[01:26:18.383 --> 01:26:20.806]  Alex, God bless you, brother, and I love you, man.
[01:26:20.846 --> 01:26:22.988]  I've been waiting over 20 years to talk to you, brother.
[01:26:23.008 --> 01:26:24.189]  Good talking to you.
[01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:28.273]  And what a topic to bring up, because July 4th just happened to be my birthday.
[01:26:28.713 --> 01:26:34.739]  So, I am in for Trump running, because basically Trump won in this last election.
[01:26:34.779 --> 01:26:35.440]  We all know that.
[01:26:36.087 --> 01:26:48.171]  However, the one thing that I want to see, Alex, and I'm sure that you and, you know, I listen to your show every single day, and I think the most important thing is who is Trump going to have on his staff?
[01:26:48.751 --> 01:26:52.232]  What is his administration going to look like this time?
[01:26:52.832 --> 01:26:58.254]  Is he going to pull on another, a bunch of wolves and, you know, and sheeps?
[01:26:59.154 --> 01:27:00.635]  And sheep's uniforms or what?
[01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.115]  That's the only thing I worry about.
[01:27:02.395 --> 01:27:04.996]  Is he going to surround himself with the enemy again?
[01:27:05.782 --> 01:27:14.865]  That's the most important question, is he really needs to come out and say, I won't make the same mistakes I made before.
[01:27:15.985 --> 01:27:19.286]  You know what, I think he won't make as many mistakes, but who knows, brother.
[01:27:20.307 --> 01:27:21.307]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:21.367 --> 01:27:31.370]  And I truly believe that he is going to take what he learned from the first four years, and I think that there's going to be a lot of people that are going to very much protect him.
[01:27:32.094 --> 01:27:37.117]  And they're going to put him to the burner and say, listen, you made these mistakes.
[01:27:37.477 --> 01:27:38.938]  We can't make these mistakes anymore.
[01:27:39.518 --> 01:27:41.319]  They're definitely scared of Trump for a reason.
[01:27:41.379 --> 01:27:43.240]  Thank you so much, because he energizes the people.
[01:27:43.260 --> 01:27:44.561]  All right, let's take another call.
[01:27:44.581 --> 01:27:45.482]  We're getting a lot of calls in.
[01:27:45.762 --> 01:27:47.843]  Let's talk to Dave in California.
[01:27:47.883 --> 01:27:48.583]  Dave, thanks for calling.
[01:27:48.603 --> 01:27:50.204]  What do you think of this situation?
[01:27:50.364 --> 01:27:52.766]  Inside Intel, directly from a conversation with Trump.
[01:27:53.106 --> 01:27:54.187]  He's planning to announce July 4th.
[01:27:55.922 --> 01:27:57.163]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:27:57.183 --> 01:28:00.426]  I think it can go both, I think it can go two ways.
[01:28:00.886 --> 01:28:03.448]  So, there's lines being drawn in the sand.
[01:28:03.888 --> 01:28:10.394]  The American people see what's going on, they see the gas prices, they see the border, they see what's going on and their pocketbooks are being affected.
[01:28:14.097 --> 01:28:26.189]   But I think, I think it's going to get to a point where The left is not going to have a choice but to do something drastic, and I think that may be a blackout nationwide.
[01:28:27.110 --> 01:28:41.666]  I think they may do something to, you know, inhibit the progression moving forward by doing something along the lines of an attack like that, by preventing everything they've worked for to kind of be crumbled.
[01:28:44.954 --> 01:28:45.914]  No, I'm listening to you.
[01:28:45.934 --> 01:28:47.255]  In fact, what you're saying is so true.
[01:28:47.435 --> 01:28:48.795]  They'll launch a war.
[01:28:49.216 --> 01:28:50.656]  They'll do a hack attack.
[01:28:50.696 --> 01:28:51.596]  They'll do a blackout.
[01:28:51.636 --> 01:28:52.357]  You're totally right.
[01:28:53.237 --> 01:28:57.078]  But yeah, real quick though, the reason why I say that is because Trump's too easy.
[01:28:57.098 --> 01:28:59.479]  They've already established all these things against Trump.
[01:28:59.559 --> 01:29:01.259]  They can't do that with another candidate.
[01:29:01.299 --> 01:29:02.800]  It would seem too disingenuous.
[01:29:03.599 --> 01:29:09.084]  So I agree with the previous caller about Ron DeSantis supporting red gun laws, like red flag laws.
[01:29:09.164 --> 01:29:10.666]  That's not ideal for us.
[01:29:11.146 --> 01:29:35.764]   So I think Trump will get into position, he'll run, and maybe before, or maybe a little bit after, they'll bring in some kind of Russian blah blah blah hoax, whatever it is, cut our power out, and basically kind of do what they've been talking about, the reset basically, and introduce their cryptocurrencies, All right, brother, I hear you, Dave.
[01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:36.244]  You're right.
[01:29:36.485 --> 01:29:40.026]  The globalists have no limit to what they'll do to maintain control.
[01:29:40.126 --> 01:29:41.287]  Hour number three coming up.
[01:29:41.347 --> 01:29:42.327]  Everybody stays with us.
[01:29:43.228 --> 01:29:50.491]  Matt, Brandon, Joel, Honey, we'll get, and Bob, we'll get to all these callers that are holding.
[01:29:51.132 --> 01:29:52.232]  And that's it for calls, though.
[01:29:52.993 --> 01:29:57.515]  We'll intersperse your calls while Alex Stein is our guest straight ahead.
[01:29:58.803 --> 01:29:59.944]  Third hour, stay with us.
[01:30:00.984 --> 01:30:01.684]  All right, folks.
[01:30:02.625 --> 01:30:04.106]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:30:04.726 --> 01:30:12.189]  The next hour, Alex Stein, traveling around the country, New York, you name it, is going to be our guest.
[01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:15.031]  So look for that in your phone calls coming up.
[01:30:15.291 --> 01:30:17.612]  Here's some of what happened in New York just a few days ago.
[01:30:21.578 --> 01:30:23.599]  You guys are awesome!
[01:30:23.699 --> 01:30:24.440]  I love you!
[01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:27.821]  Get this!
[01:30:27.841 --> 01:30:29.902]  This is what I think about their signs.
[01:30:30.022 --> 01:30:31.243]  Oh, so scary!
[01:30:31.683 --> 01:30:33.004]  Oh, I'm so scared!
[01:30:33.344 --> 01:30:36.486]  This is what I think about their signs, guys.
[01:30:36.506 --> 01:30:37.406]  This is crap!
[01:30:37.506 --> 01:30:39.908]  Oh, we're so scared!
[01:30:40.288 --> 01:30:42.129]  PrimeTime99 is on the brand!
[01:30:42.349 --> 01:30:43.049]  These are words!
[01:30:43.089 --> 01:30:43.470]  Look at this!
[01:30:43.490 --> 01:30:44.130]  You see this?
[01:30:48.012 --> 01:30:48.933]  Let's go, baby!
[01:30:50.133 --> 01:30:50.714]  Look at this!
[01:30:50.734 --> 01:30:53.615]  My very own protester, Proton99!
[01:30:53.695 --> 01:30:55.456]  I made it on the grind!
[01:30:55.476 --> 01:30:56.817]  This is on time!
[01:30:56.897 --> 01:30:59.759]  Thank you guys for coming to the show.
[01:30:59.799 --> 01:31:00.959]  Thank y'all so much.
[01:31:01.039 --> 01:31:02.320]  I really appreciate your support.
[01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:03.581]  We did it, guys!
[01:31:03.621 --> 01:31:04.641]  This is the real show!
[01:31:04.781 --> 01:31:05.422]  It's Proton99!
[01:31:05.442 --> 01:31:08.063]  This is the VIP Fest!
[01:31:08.123 --> 01:31:09.684]  This is how we grind this out.
[01:31:09.704 --> 01:31:11.165]  This is how we win the culture war!
[01:31:11.205 --> 01:31:12.826]  Come around this way, bro.
[01:31:13.286 --> 01:31:15.327]  This is how we do it, guys.
[01:31:15.507 --> 01:31:19.188]  This is when you know it's effective, when people will come out here and protest you.
[01:31:19.228 --> 01:31:21.388]  That's because these people love the establishment.
[01:31:21.808 --> 01:31:23.629]  We are the anti-establishment.
[01:31:23.769 --> 01:31:25.629]  We are the counterculture.
[01:31:25.669 --> 01:31:26.850]  These guys defend.
[01:31:27.170 --> 01:31:28.210]  They call me a fascist.
[01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:29.190]  They're the fascists.
[01:31:29.210 --> 01:31:33.931]  The definition of fascism is a merger of corporations and states.
[01:31:34.051 --> 01:31:34.552]  Hey, hey!
[01:31:34.972 --> 01:31:35.572]  Hey, ho!
[01:31:36.012 --> 01:31:37.712]  Pride time has got you now!
[01:31:37.752 --> 01:31:38.313]  Hey, hey!
[01:31:38.753 --> 01:31:39.213]  Ho, ho!
[01:31:39.993 --> 01:31:40.653]  Crowd time!
[01:31:40.713 --> 01:31:41.874]  Let's go, here we go!
[01:31:41.934 --> 01:31:42.354]  Hey, hey!
[01:31:42.694 --> 01:31:43.274]  Ho, ho!
[01:31:43.874 --> 01:31:44.634]  Crowd time!
[01:31:44.674 --> 01:31:45.415]  Let's go, here we go!
[01:31:45.435 --> 01:31:47.035]  Look at this, it's gonna be a good song!
[01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:49.636]  It's arts and crafts time for Antifa tonight!
[01:31:49.756 --> 01:31:50.476]  I love it!
[01:31:51.356 --> 01:31:52.597]  This is arts and crafts!
[01:31:52.617 --> 01:31:53.337]  Did y'all get it?
[01:31:53.357 --> 01:31:54.037]  Where did y'all get it?
[01:31:54.057 --> 01:31:55.838]  Joey has fabrics and get the signs?
[01:31:56.838 --> 01:31:57.299]  Look at this!
[01:31:57.319 --> 01:31:58.700]  This is how you know you're winning!
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:31:59.541]  I love it!
[01:32:00.602 --> 01:32:04.606]  But I want to say, I love you all!
[01:32:04.626 --> 01:32:06.945]  are gonna be all because you don't buy boxes.
[01:32:06.945 --> 01:32:08.865]  But I want to say I love you all.
[01:32:08.865 --> 01:32:11.786]   I know you guys don't like me, but I love each and every one of you.
[01:32:11.786 --> 01:32:16.225]   I think when you're not wearing socks with your fucking boxers in.
[01:32:17.237 --> 01:32:18.318]  I mean that.
[01:32:18.398 --> 01:32:21.140]  With your moccasins, you idiot!
[01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:21.781]  Wow!
[01:32:21.961 --> 01:32:22.781]  Feet live!
[01:32:22.961 --> 01:32:24.543]  I really appreciate this.
[01:32:24.583 --> 01:32:25.583]  Hey, I'm Alex Dine.
[01:32:25.663 --> 01:32:26.864]  AlexDine99 on Twitter.
[01:32:27.044 --> 01:32:28.946]  No, but seriously, look at this.
[01:32:29.146 --> 01:32:30.267]  I love drag, guys.
[01:32:30.427 --> 01:32:31.247]  I'm genderfluid.
[01:32:32.349 --> 01:32:33.971]  For a little bit, I'm back on.
[01:32:34.191 --> 01:32:35.713]  But I'm just saying, I love you.
[01:32:35.934 --> 01:32:36.414]  I love you.
[01:32:36.555 --> 01:32:38.798]  I hope you put Trump on a dick.
[01:32:39.539 --> 01:32:40.240]  I love you though.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.543]  I hope you put Trump on a trans girl's dick.
[01:32:43.445 --> 01:32:46.509]  I hope you put Trump on a trans girl's dick.
[01:32:47.490 --> 01:32:50.632]  Wow, that's sweet, but I want you to live a long, prosperous life.
[01:32:50.692 --> 01:32:52.452]  Yeah, and I hope you die.
[01:32:53.153 --> 01:32:54.613]  That's what they want me to do, Jeff!
[01:32:55.034 --> 01:32:55.894]  Chant it for the Goyim!
[01:32:55.934 --> 01:32:56.134]  Wow!
[01:32:56.154 --> 01:32:58.115]  Chant it for the Goyim!
[01:32:58.275 --> 01:33:02.137]  I don't even know what that quite means, but I know that you're a good person, and I love you.
[01:33:02.157 --> 01:33:02.397]  I'm not.
[01:33:02.637 --> 01:33:03.037]  Not to you.
[01:33:03.057 --> 01:33:03.938]  I'm not a good person.
[01:33:03.958 --> 01:33:04.978]  Not to you.
[01:33:04.998 --> 01:33:09.320]  You're within my personal space, and I'm more than upground in New York state law to actually push you away.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.582]  Okay, well, I'm just saying, I'm a fan here, so please move away.
[01:33:13.062 --> 01:33:15.385]  These people are under, they have mental issues, guys.
[01:33:15.686 --> 01:33:17.328]  These people are on antidepressants.
[01:33:17.588 --> 01:33:19.550]  These guys have horrible mental issues.
[01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:21.433]  That's why they come out here and do this.
[01:33:21.813 --> 01:33:22.394]  And you know what?
[01:33:22.494 --> 01:33:23.035]  I love it.
[01:33:23.075 --> 01:33:24.356]  This is how you know I made it.
[01:33:24.496 --> 01:33:26.699]  When I can just come out here and do whatever I want.
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:28.101]  Look at that!
[01:33:28.201 --> 01:33:29.062]  Alex Stein!
[01:33:29.082 --> 01:33:31.805]  This is the best!
[01:33:32.926 --> 01:33:36.849]  I'm a little disappointed.
[01:33:36.889 --> 01:33:39.130]  There was a sign earlier with my name on it.
[01:33:39.091 --> 01:33:40.091]  I'm very sad.
[01:33:40.091 --> 01:33:46.591]   Alright guys, we gotta go. I love you guys. Keep following me on Twitter. You guys are the best. Thank you so much.

[01:34:34.904 --> 01:34:38.527]  This is what I think about their signs!
[01:34:38.647 --> 01:34:39.888]  Oh, so scary!
[01:34:40.308 --> 01:34:41.649]  Oh, I'm so scared!
[01:34:42.169 --> 01:34:45.651]  This is what I think about their signs, guys!
[01:34:45.691 --> 01:34:46.812]  This is crap!
[01:34:46.932 --> 01:34:48.573]  Oh, we're so scared!
[01:34:48.933 --> 01:34:50.715]  PrimeTime99 is on the brand!
[01:34:50.995 --> 01:34:51.655]  These are wigs!
[01:34:51.715 --> 01:34:52.316]  Look at this!
[01:34:52.136 --> 01:34:57.136]  You see this? You see this? You see this? AHHHHH! Let's go!
[01:34:57.136 --> 01:35:06.136]   *outro music* It's me, Primetime99, and Ross the Boss!
[01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:07.030]  What up, baby?
[01:35:07.050 --> 01:35:13.233]  And we're here in Washington Square Park asking people all about Pride, why they're here, what they're celebrating, having a good time.
[01:35:13.293 --> 01:35:15.293]  Let's go get it baby girl!
[01:35:15.293 --> 01:35:19.293]   *music* *music*
[01:35:19.293 --> 01:35:23.293]   *music* Dude, this place is insane!
[01:35:23.498 --> 01:35:24.279]  Yes!
[01:35:24.759 --> 01:35:27.160]  Yes, yes, and more yes!
[01:35:29.241 --> 01:35:30.462]  Are you a pony or a person?
[01:35:30.542 --> 01:35:31.943]  I don't give a sh**, you're mine!
[01:35:33.018 --> 01:35:37.500]  Are there people swimming in it?
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:41.841]  My name is Star with two R's, two R's, two R's.
[01:35:42.121 --> 01:35:43.702]  Are you in favor of My Body, My Choice?
[01:35:44.082 --> 01:35:46.203]  Oh, My Body, My Choice.
[01:35:46.723 --> 01:35:48.084]  Why live in Connecticut?
[01:35:48.404 --> 01:35:51.265]  And my governor said it's still our fucking choice.
[01:35:51.445 --> 01:35:52.365]  All nips are out too.
[01:35:52.605 --> 01:35:54.566]  Sun's out, hun's out, honey buns all over.
[01:35:55.976 --> 01:35:57.076]  I gotta walk up with the energy.
[01:35:57.096 --> 01:35:58.136]  I gotta walk up with the energy.
[01:35:58.156 --> 01:35:58.477]  You ready?
[01:35:59.377 --> 01:35:59.917]  Yes!
[01:35:59.957 --> 01:36:00.877]  This is the fun corner.
[01:36:00.917 --> 01:36:02.557]  How's everybody doing?
[01:36:02.977 --> 01:36:03.738]  Turn up!
[01:36:03.838 --> 01:36:04.858]  Turn up!
[01:36:05.458 --> 01:36:05.938]  You're a queen.
[01:36:05.998 --> 01:36:06.518]  I'm loving it.
[01:36:06.558 --> 01:36:07.558]  So let me ask you a question.
[01:36:08.198 --> 01:36:09.979]  Do you have the best booty out here, do you think?
[01:36:10.759 --> 01:36:11.299]  No.
[01:36:11.779 --> 01:36:13.420]  I mean, it's great.
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:14.960]  It's fantastical.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.120]  I mean, never been done before.
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:17.260]  Never been seen before.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.221]  Okay, let me ask everybody a question.
[01:36:19.541 --> 01:36:25.442]  Now that we're all out here together and we're having fun together, do we kind of think, since none of us are wearing masks, that maybe it was a little bit bullshit?
[01:36:27.239 --> 01:36:28.420]  A little bit!
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:29.181]  She told the truth!
[01:36:29.601 --> 01:36:31.723]  Everybody else thinks that when no one's looking though, right?
[01:36:31.743 --> 01:36:32.163]  Controversial.
[01:36:32.203 --> 01:36:33.684]  This is getting controversial.
[01:36:33.724 --> 01:36:35.846]  This is controversial to some people though.
[01:36:35.886 --> 01:36:37.648]  Come on, who cares about controversy, girl?
[01:36:37.668 --> 01:36:44.954]  Are you in favor of My Body, My Choice?
[01:36:45.434 --> 01:36:46.255]  Yes, of course.
[01:36:46.295 --> 01:36:47.336]  My Body, My Choice.
[01:36:48.176 --> 01:36:48.737]  Okay, awesome.
[01:36:48.757 --> 01:36:49.678]  Let me ask you guys a question.
[01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:51.479]  My Body, My Choice, right?
[01:36:51.579 --> 01:36:51.799]  Yes!
[01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:52.900]  Yes.
[01:36:53.441 --> 01:36:55.883]  Okay, what about for vaccine mandates?
[01:36:58.683 --> 01:37:00.525]  My body, my choice, they just said it!
[01:37:00.805 --> 01:37:02.266]  But even for vaccine mandates, right?
[01:37:02.326 --> 01:37:03.887]  Like, if you don't want it, fuck you, I don't want it.
[01:37:03.908 --> 01:37:07.891]  I don't know how I feel about it, actually.
[01:37:08.451 --> 01:37:09.652]  Oh, the tower's falling!
[01:37:09.692 --> 01:37:10.653]  Come on, say no!
[01:37:10.673 --> 01:37:12.315]  Fuck no, if you don't want it, you don't have to have it.
[01:37:12.335 --> 01:37:14.036]  Okay, fair enough.
[01:37:14.056 --> 01:37:15.517]  Alright, freedom!
[01:37:15.598 --> 01:37:16.458]  Let's go, bitches!
[01:37:17.559 --> 01:37:19.741]  Do you like My Body, My Choice?
[01:37:20.221 --> 01:37:20.482]  Yes.
[01:37:21.663 --> 01:37:23.064]  What about for vaccine mandates?
[01:37:23.104 --> 01:37:23.785]  Can people choose?
[01:37:24.565 --> 01:37:24.805]  Yes.
[01:37:25.606 --> 01:37:26.147]  Okay!
[01:37:30.551 --> 01:37:31.392]  Let's go!
[01:37:31.852 --> 01:37:34.033]  Anybody else anti-vax in this mug?
[01:37:34.533 --> 01:37:35.354]  What is your name?
[01:37:36.094 --> 01:37:38.175]  The Real Joker of NYC, nice to meet you.
[01:37:38.195 --> 01:37:39.336]  The Real Joker, I love it.
[01:37:39.496 --> 01:37:40.897]  So, my body, my choice?
[01:37:41.857 --> 01:37:42.818]  Your body, your choice.
[01:37:43.258 --> 01:37:44.779]  What about for vaccine mandates?
[01:37:44.819 --> 01:37:46.360]  My body, my choice for vaccine mandates?
[01:37:46.380 --> 01:37:48.161]  Hey, if you don't want it, don't get it, bro.
[01:37:48.181 --> 01:37:49.562]  Oh, I love it!
[01:37:49.582 --> 01:37:51.463]  They can't tell us what to do with our bodies.
[01:37:51.503 --> 01:37:53.244]  They have to make me score our bodies.
[01:37:53.324 --> 01:37:53.824]  High fives?
[01:37:54.824 --> 01:37:56.305]  Your body, your choice, right?
[01:37:56.325 --> 01:37:56.845]  Yes!
[01:37:57.666 --> 01:37:59.347]  Even for vaccine mandates, right?
[01:38:01.144 --> 01:38:02.246]  Okay, I like it.
[01:38:02.526 --> 01:38:03.228]  Who said boo?
[01:38:03.248 --> 01:38:03.748]  Who said boo?
[01:38:03.788 --> 01:38:04.389]  I want to hear it.
[01:38:05.691 --> 01:38:06.372]  That's right.
[01:38:06.393 --> 01:38:07.995]  You shut up and keep your hands off my body.
[01:38:10.659 --> 01:38:11.501]  My body, my choice.
[01:38:14.625 --> 01:38:15.927]  For vaccine mandates too.
[01:38:18.423 --> 01:38:23.423]   I love it. I hope y'all keep that energy if they try some bullsh*t with the monkey pox.
[01:38:23.423 --> 01:38:27.423]   It means we're having fun, enjoying ourselves, enjoying everybody, enjoying the love that spreads around.
[01:38:27.423 --> 01:38:32.423]   Stop the hate, stop the bullsh*t, live your life, you will be free, and be naked.
[01:38:32.423 --> 01:38:33.423]  And be naked.
[01:38:33.423 --> 01:38:34.423]  And be naked.
[01:38:34.423 --> 01:38:44.423]   Inside the Leptis Mob, but at least they didn't catch a bunch of kids being paraded to the streets with naked men
[01:38:44.423 --> 01:38:49.423]   like Seattle, Alex Stein is a comedian.
[01:38:49.778 --> 01:38:50.698]  He's a talk show host.
[01:38:50.718 --> 01:38:54.179]  His mother died last year, murdered by the COVID tyranny in a hospital.
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:56.920]  And he has been absolutely on fire.
[01:38:57.601 --> 01:39:00.942]  Tens of millions of views a week, all over the place, exposing hypocrisy.
[01:39:01.362 --> 01:39:03.363]  Congratulations to him on all of that.
[01:39:04.023 --> 01:39:09.905]  Obviously, I didn't intend to have callers during today's show, but I had to because Roger Stone talks to Trump.
[01:39:10.683 --> 01:39:11.223]  That's a huge piece of news.
[01:39:11.263 --> 01:39:11.603]  Exclusive.
[01:39:11.623 --> 01:39:15.724]  We've now posted that video of Roger Stone in the first hour at Infowars.com.
[01:39:15.583 --> 01:39:19.783]   mad he didn't want to run. Now okay they're messing with him, he's gonna run and now he's
[01:39:19.783 --> 01:39:25.023]   gonna run. Looks like he's gonna announce in July, probably July 4th. That's a huge
[01:39:25.023 --> 01:39:29.583]   piece of news, exclusive. We've now posted that video, Roger Stone, in the first hour
[01:39:29.583 --> 01:39:35.583]   at InfoWars.com. If people want to see the big announcement from the guy that got Trump
[01:39:35.583 --> 01:39:40.943]   to run the first time, got him to announce for a little while decades ago, then obviously
[01:39:40.943 --> 01:39:43.023]  run in 2015, 2016.
[01:39:43.521 --> 01:39:51.871]  What is your views of Trump, Alex Stein, prime time Alex Stein, running for president 2024?
[01:39:51.911 --> 01:39:52.712]  What's your view on that?
[01:39:53.868 --> 01:39:57.632]  Well, I really appreciate you having me on, and I appreciate the question because it's a little nuanced.
[01:39:57.692 --> 01:40:12.866]  I mean, if you look at what's happening right now in our political culture, you have Donald Trump who's universally hated, you have the sham January 6 trial that's obviously a waste of taxpayer money, and we know that everything that happened on January 6 isn't close to as bad as what happened at the Summer of Love with the George Floyd riots.
[01:40:13.675 --> 01:40:15.818]  But, sadly, people are dumb, Alex.
[01:40:15.858 --> 01:40:16.499]  You know this.
[01:40:16.539 --> 01:40:22.207]  So this is my only, you know, thing that worries me about Trump is there's so much baggage with Trump that DeSantis doesn't have.
[01:40:22.248 --> 01:40:23.209]  Now, I love Trump.
[01:40:23.289 --> 01:40:24.270]  I like a vengeful Trump.
[01:40:24.311 --> 01:40:26.133]  If Trump runs, I'm behind Trump 1,000%.
[01:40:27.958 --> 01:40:34.501]  But these people are so dumb and they will use fake evidence against Trump that they don't have on DeSantis.
[01:40:34.861 --> 01:40:45.365]  So for me, I mean, I'm willing to back whoever is going to be on the conservative side, but I almost think Trump would be more powerful being a kingmaker than by running for president personally.
[01:40:45.465 --> 01:40:52.328]  Very smart, nuanced statement by primetime Alex Stein here with us right now.
[01:40:55.066 --> 01:40:57.271]  They are pressuring Trump into this position.
[01:40:57.291 --> 01:40:58.654]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:40:58.695 --> 01:41:00.078]  They've got all this made up stuff.
[01:41:00.098 --> 01:41:02.263]  But I think it makes them about the Santas.
[01:41:02.564 --> 01:41:09.043]   I'm sure you noticed, it's now the Secret Service has confirmed this testimony that
[01:41:09.043 --> 01:41:15.564]   he tried to grab the beast presidential limo wheel on January 6th and all this, and the
[01:41:15.564 --> 01:41:20.443]   letters she said was real wasn't real, and her saying that Trump and Meadows were calling
[01:41:20.443 --> 01:41:24.283]   Roger Stone and General Flynn on January 6th, and none of that's true.
[01:41:24.283 --> 01:41:28.243]   So I get they can make stuff up, but I mean, we know they do that.
[01:41:28.243 --> 01:41:33.204]   I mean, they say on CNN that I become demon possessed and have a black tongue.
[01:41:33.204 --> 01:41:35.844]  I'd never heard of a black tongue until they said that.
[01:41:35.844 --> 01:41:39.844]   No, I mean, they're going to make up lies, and I have to give Trump so much credit because
[01:41:39.844 --> 01:41:43.804]   what he did with the Supreme Court of Justice and what he did by turning it into a conservative
[01:41:43.804 --> 01:41:48.524]   court and getting rid of Roe v. Wade has saved so many countless lives.
[01:41:48.547 --> 01:41:52.994]  So Donald Trump is an American hero for all the countless numbers of babies that are going to be born.
[01:41:53.414 --> 01:41:55.096]  That were once going to be terminated.
[01:41:55.216 --> 01:41:57.578]  And so, you know, he's a he's a hero in my mind.
[01:41:57.878 --> 01:42:00.941]  Now, obviously, with every president, you can say, oh, should have done this, should have done that.
[01:42:01.481 --> 01:42:05.565]  And if he runs, like I said, he's a great human being just for the Roe versus Wade.
[01:42:05.845 --> 01:42:11.551]  I agree, but it gets counterbalanced by there now the FDA saying six month olds and others with this deadly shot.
[01:42:11.931 --> 01:42:14.733]  So he needs to come out and say, hey, I got stampeded into this.
[01:42:15.434 --> 01:42:16.415]  It has some problems.
[01:42:16.455 --> 01:42:19.398]  They lied to me instead of coupling himself to this loser.
[01:42:20.785 --> 01:42:27.209]  Well, I mean, Alex, we live in a world where they look us in the face and they say sudden adult death syndrome is a real thing.
[01:42:27.529 --> 01:42:31.172]  That is the biggest crock of lies I've ever heard in my entire life.
[01:42:31.192 --> 01:42:38.236]  Now, we've heard of SIDS, and if you look at the MMR scheduling on that, there's a direct correlation that the big pharma exactly says.
[01:42:38.416 --> 01:42:42.399]  Major Australian studies that SIDS and Japanese studies is caused by vaccines.
[01:42:43.661 --> 01:42:48.324]  Yes, they say correlation doesn't mean causation, but anybody with half a brain realizes that's a lie.
[01:42:48.364 --> 01:42:49.205]  That's a bold-faced lie.
[01:42:49.225 --> 01:42:51.807]  So they're looking us in our face and saying adults are just dying at 32.
[01:42:51.867 --> 01:42:55.349]  Thin adults that wouldn't normally have any sort of heart issue.
[01:42:55.369 --> 01:42:56.610]  No, no, I agree, but here's the deal.
[01:42:56.970 --> 01:42:58.171]  Here's why we know he's running.
[01:42:58.932 --> 01:43:02.854]  They just announced today six more women say he raped them with no evidence.
[01:43:03.174 --> 01:43:04.015]  Just like Kavanaugh.
[01:43:04.655 --> 01:43:06.677]  I mean, is that not a big indicator they're scared?
[01:43:07.717 --> 01:43:10.119]  Yeah, I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:11.280]  All the lies.
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:12.021]  That's the problem.
[01:43:12.061 --> 01:43:16.385]  People are able to decipher the lies like you and me because we can say that the news is totally fake.
[01:43:16.666 --> 01:43:18.467]  But sadly, Alex, you know this.
[01:43:18.487 --> 01:43:24.513]  The mass population are all dumbed down on antidepressants, have no idea left, right, up and down.
[01:43:24.553 --> 01:43:25.494]  They're worried about their bills.
[01:43:25.514 --> 01:43:26.575]  They're worried about the inflation.
[01:43:26.855 --> 01:43:35.879]  And they have a president, Joe Biden, that's not doing anything to help them, and we have his son, Hunter Biden, giving $10,000 to Ukrainian and Russian prostitutes, and we don't hear a peep about it.
[01:43:36.159 --> 01:43:49.604]  So if people just looked one centimeter under the surface, I mean, just right underneath it, they would realize that we're living in a world of corruption and hypocrisy, but they can't see that the forest is right in front of their face because of the big media tree that they have planted right in front of them.
[01:43:49.624 --> 01:43:51.645]  Well, that's right, and it's not just that he was with hookers.
[01:43:52.265 --> 01:43:55.752]  The media covered it up and obviously a lot of those are going to be Russian operatives.
[01:43:56.193 --> 01:44:00.421]  If you're the Vice President's son with hookers, Russian hookers, you can bet you're being compromised.
[01:44:00.441 --> 01:44:01.163]  That's the big issue.
[01:44:02.384 --> 01:44:06.248]  And you know, Alex, honest to God, Hunter Biden is the most redeeming thing about Joe Biden.
[01:44:06.328 --> 01:44:07.809]  I actually am empathetic to Hunter Biden.
[01:44:07.829 --> 01:44:08.590]  He lost his mother.
[01:44:08.610 --> 01:44:10.912]  I have a lot of friends that have struggled with drugs and alcohol.
[01:44:11.232 --> 01:44:12.693]  So that's not even the worst part about it.
[01:44:12.893 --> 01:44:17.197]  The worst part is how he sold out our country to all these foreign companies, whether they're China.
[01:44:17.457 --> 01:44:19.319]  That's the worst part about Hunter Biden.
[01:44:19.539 --> 01:44:21.661]  But you know, his drug problem, that's the thing the media will give us.
[01:44:21.681 --> 01:44:23.262]  They'll give us crackpipes all day long.
[01:44:23.483 --> 01:44:27.626]  But they're not going to talk about his evil business dealings that have sold out the American people.
[01:44:27.646 --> 01:44:28.027]  That's right.
[01:44:28.047 --> 01:44:30.729]   Him saying, I'm under the control of the top Communist Chinese spy.
[01:44:30.769 --> 01:44:32.270]  That's on the laptop.
[01:44:32.611 --> 01:44:33.451]  And it's all real.
[01:44:33.491 --> 01:44:34.432]  They said it wasn't real.
[01:44:34.472 --> 01:44:36.154]  They censored people that covered it.
[01:44:36.194 --> 01:44:37.495]  But we are vindicated again.
[01:44:37.935 --> 01:44:39.797]  Alex Stein is our guest.
[01:44:39.877 --> 01:44:41.278]  Your phone call straight ahead.
[01:44:41.438 --> 01:44:43.480]  Big, big Wednesday broadcast.
[01:44:46.374 --> 01:44:57.806]  So, Alex Stein, primetime 99s on the Alex Jones Show on this Wednesday edition, and he was in New York and other areas, Dallas, you name it, during the pedophile pride parades.
[01:44:58.287 --> 01:45:05.214]  He came out to have his own event, and Antifa showed up to protest, and he was so happy, they were so upset they didn't know what to do.
[01:45:05.234 --> 01:45:05.955]  Here's some of what happened.
[01:45:09.885 --> 01:45:11.607]  You guys are awesome!
[01:45:11.727 --> 01:45:12.207]  I love you!
[01:45:14.028 --> 01:45:17.571]  This is what I think about their signs.
[01:45:17.691 --> 01:45:19.273]  Oh, so scary!
[01:45:19.573 --> 01:45:21.054]  Oh, I'm so scared!
[01:45:21.254 --> 01:45:23.176]  This is what I think about their signs, guys.
[01:45:23.196 --> 01:45:23.916]  This is crap.
[01:45:24.116 --> 01:45:25.037]  This is what they're doing.
[01:45:25.077 --> 01:45:26.438]  This is all they want to do.
[01:45:26.538 --> 01:45:27.919]  Oh, we're so scared!
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.161]  Pride Time 99 is on the brand!
[01:45:30.361 --> 01:45:31.062]  These are wigs!
[01:45:31.102 --> 01:45:31.482]  Look at this!
[01:45:31.522 --> 01:45:32.163]  You see this?
[01:45:36.026 --> 01:45:36.966]  Let's go, baby!
[01:45:38.167 --> 01:45:38.727]  Look at this!
[01:45:38.767 --> 01:45:40.548]  My very own protesters!
[01:45:40.588 --> 01:45:41.589]  Pride Time 99!
[01:45:41.729 --> 01:45:43.490]  I made it on the drive!
[01:45:43.610 --> 01:45:44.350]  See, they think we're crazy.
[01:45:44.370 --> 01:45:46.071]  We're ten times crazier than they think.
[01:45:46.091 --> 01:45:47.772]  Thank you guys for coming to the show.
[01:45:47.812 --> 01:45:48.993]  Thank y'all so much.
[01:45:49.013 --> 01:45:49.973]  They think they're crazy?
[01:45:50.954 --> 01:45:53.555]  Wait until the people just leave me alone.
[01:45:54.055 --> 01:45:55.636]  Get off the bench.
[01:45:55.716 --> 01:45:59.538]  And you know, Alex Town is a sad story, but you shared it with us.
[01:45:59.618 --> 01:46:01.999]  I didn't see you share it anywhere else, but...
[01:46:03.943 --> 01:46:12.850]  One city council meeting in Dallas is them killing your mother in the hospital, denying her treatments, what pushed you over the edge, and now you're reaching millions of people a day.
[01:46:13.710 --> 01:46:15.772]  Your mother, I know, looking down from heaven, is very proud of you.
[01:46:17.133 --> 01:46:25.460]  Yeah, well I appreciate that, and I just was, uh, a good friend of mine is Gavin McInnes, and I was on his show, and he actually said it, you know, not in jest, he said, your mom dying was the best thing that ever happened to you.
[01:46:25.480 --> 01:46:26.561]  Well, first of all, it was the worst thing.
[01:46:26.601 --> 01:46:33.667]  I would trade all the, you know, the hits and clicks and followers and all the stuff I got from my mom in a second to have her back.
[01:46:33.988 --> 01:46:40.553]  But I will say this, it has made me a dangerous man because I have nothing to lose, and that is the most dangerous person as a person who has nothing to lose.
[01:46:40.613 --> 01:46:41.154]  It pushed you over the edge.
[01:46:42.142 --> 01:46:45.384]  A hundred percent, Alex, and I have no choice but to fight back in this culture war.
[01:46:45.724 --> 01:46:55.569]  And the reason why I want to bring up what's happening with this Arts and Crafts Antifa is these people are organized in a manner where half the people that are protesting, there's about 15 to 20 people there.
[01:46:55.589 --> 01:46:58.491]  I was doing a charity event for a children's health defense.
[01:46:58.571 --> 01:47:00.192]  It was a charity Robert Kennedy runs.
[01:47:00.612 --> 01:47:03.633]  And it's, you know, it's an anti-vax charity, basically.
[01:47:03.913 --> 01:47:06.094]  And so they weren't there to protest that.
[01:47:06.174 --> 01:47:07.334]  They were there to protest me.
[01:47:07.354 --> 01:47:13.676]  They had been sending the clubs, they had been flooding them with emails saying that, you know, I'm transphobic, I'm homophobic, not to allow me to go there.
[01:47:13.976 --> 01:47:14.896]  And then they showed up.
[01:47:14.956 --> 01:47:18.617]  So I guess my point that I want to bring up, it seems so artificial, Alex.
[01:47:18.657 --> 01:47:20.798]  It seems like they're getting paid by somebody.
[01:47:20.838 --> 01:47:22.838]  It seems like there's some sort of organization behind it.
[01:47:23.138 --> 01:47:25.439]  Because, yeah, a couple of those people didn't like me, I'm sure.
[01:47:25.719 --> 01:47:28.300]  But probably half of those protesters didn't know who I was.
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:29.822]  So it's just very confusing.
[01:47:29.842 --> 01:47:36.677]  Oh, it's on record that Soros and the Fortune 500 openly finance Black Lives Matter and Drag Queen Pedophile Time.
[01:47:37.822 --> 01:47:38.723]  That's what I'm saying, Alex.
[01:47:38.763 --> 01:47:40.524]  I mean, there's somebody who paid them to be there.
[01:47:40.584 --> 01:47:45.107]  I mean, I just really don't think they hated me that much because, you know, they didn't really have anything to say.
[01:47:45.127 --> 01:47:46.448]  They just sat there with their signs.
[01:47:46.468 --> 01:47:50.131]  Because this is the thing is when you get in their face, I love confrontation.
[01:47:50.191 --> 01:47:52.413]  That's my whole, I hate to use this word, brand.
[01:47:52.693 --> 01:47:53.894]  But I'm about to go to D.C.
[01:47:54.214 --> 01:47:55.555]  on the 13th and I'm going to stay there.
[01:47:55.595 --> 01:47:59.758]  I'm going on Tim Pool's show and I'm going to be at Capitol Hill and I'm going to go confront all these politicians.
[01:47:59.778 --> 01:48:01.659]  I'm going to say, Elon Omar, you married your brother.
[01:48:01.679 --> 01:48:03.961]  I'm going to say AOC, you're my favorite big booty Latina.
[01:48:04.301 --> 01:48:08.405]  I'm going to get in all these politicians' face because that's what I like to do is I like confrontation.
[01:48:08.945 --> 01:48:13.729]  Now these people, they want to... What did they do when they thought it would scare you they were there protesting and you loved it so much?
[01:48:14.110 --> 01:48:15.611]  What happened after you shot this video?
[01:48:16.559 --> 01:48:25.404]  Well, the funniest thing is that the adrenaline is so high, and so I actually stopped drinking and using drugs, and I used to smoke a little bit of marijuana, but I stopped after my mom died because it was making me so depressed.
[01:48:25.704 --> 01:48:29.586]  So my new drug is actually the adrenaline rush from calling these freaks out.
[01:48:29.906 --> 01:48:33.128]  But I'll tell you this much, the comedy club, they said, hey, do you want to go out the back door, Alex?
[01:48:33.148 --> 01:48:34.749]  You know, there's a door, you can go out the back door.
[01:48:35.049 --> 01:48:36.049]  I said, are you kidding?
[01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:44.451]  I'm going out the front door and I'm holding court out there like I'm the Supreme Court Justice myself, like I'm Clarence Thomas because they want us to live in fear.
[01:48:44.471 --> 01:48:46.592]  That's how they use, that's how they manipulate us.
[01:48:46.612 --> 01:48:56.194]  They keep us in that constant trauma-based mind control fight-or-flight state where we're like a dog with a little treat and that's how the globalists, oh come here, do this, sudden adult death syndrome.
[01:48:56.494 --> 01:49:01.836]  So for me, I'm not going to fall in line with what they want and let their fear-based tactics work.
[01:49:02.196 --> 01:49:04.556]  I'm going to live fearless, and I know one day I'm going to die.
[01:49:04.596 --> 01:49:07.277]  That's a sad realization that I do not necessarily like.
[01:49:07.677 --> 01:49:09.838]  But I know that that's going to happen.
[01:49:09.998 --> 01:49:12.079]  I'm not going to live my life in fear of dying.
[01:49:12.119 --> 01:49:15.800]  So I'm going to go out there, I'm going to push the envelope, and I'm going to call these people out.
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:23.282]  And that's really just what gives me my most passion and most joy, Alex, in this day and age, is exposing the hypocrisy that we're currently living under.
[01:49:24.724 --> 01:49:27.626]  And I like how you're nice to these people unless they got kids there.
[01:49:28.166 --> 01:49:34.130]  When they're not running around dressed like idiots having, you know, a crazy time, okay, we don't agree with your politics, but we don't hate you.
[01:49:34.430 --> 01:49:36.611]  When they bring kids to this stuff, then they're the enemy.
[01:49:37.692 --> 01:49:38.652]  A hundred percent, Alex.
[01:49:38.732 --> 01:49:39.693]  I mean, that makes me sick.
[01:49:39.733 --> 01:49:49.919]  There's no way a kid should be exposed to this stuff, and that's why the Drag Queen Storytime, that's kind of this month I've gone really viral because that was the, I think that happened June 6th, and that was one of the biggest stories for about a week.
[01:49:49.959 --> 01:49:51.140]  It's not going to lick itself.
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.581]  They got kids and a sex bar.
[01:49:53.604 --> 01:50:01.686]  And they had multiple legislation in Florida and Texas trying, you know, trying to outlaw this exact thing of being sexualized by drag queens in front of kids.
[01:50:02.046 --> 01:50:09.188]  But this brought attention to a major problem is that now all these governments like New York spending two million dollars for these drag queen story times.
[01:50:09.288 --> 01:50:11.209]  Other states are spending hundreds.
[01:50:11.329 --> 01:50:12.349]  Governments are backing it.
[01:50:13.588 --> 01:50:18.174]  So we're doing a good job of exposing this, but these children, they cannot make this choice.
[01:50:18.774 --> 01:50:21.838]  You know, having a trans child is like having a vegan cat.
[01:50:21.918 --> 01:50:23.860]  It's the owner making that decision.
[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:26.643]  And that's the problem, is we have bad... Say that again.
[01:50:26.683 --> 01:50:29.206]  Having a trans child is like having a vegan cat.
[01:50:29.266 --> 01:50:30.067]  Man, that's genius.
[01:50:31.276 --> 01:50:36.361]  And it's seriously, it's just these parents, and that's why Bill Maher, forget his politics, but, you know, he said it best.
[01:50:36.401 --> 01:50:44.449]  You look at the amount of kids that are gender hormone surgery or gender, you know, hormone blockers in California compared to Ohio, is alarmingly much higher.
[01:50:44.689 --> 01:50:47.712]  Because those are the people, the parents that are making these kids do it.
[01:50:47.732 --> 01:50:51.455]  Look, if they can't abort the baby before it's born, they want to abort their genitals later.
[01:50:51.475 --> 01:50:54.258]  This is human neutering is the transgender movement.
[01:50:54.278 --> 01:50:56.400]  It was set up to sterilize boys.
[01:50:57.879 --> 01:50:58.960]  You're 100% right.
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:00.662]  And this thing has been happening for a long time.
[01:51:00.702 --> 01:51:01.683]  You know this.
[01:51:02.143 --> 01:51:03.384]  This kind of trans movement.
[01:51:03.424 --> 01:51:04.646]  Now it's just coming into effect.
[01:51:05.086 --> 01:51:06.027]  Now they have legislation.
[01:51:06.087 --> 01:51:06.988]  Now they have backing.
[01:51:07.008 --> 01:51:10.911]  But we live in a clown world where everybody knows it's not okay to do this in front of kids.
[01:51:11.192 --> 01:51:13.934]  Even when you call the drag queens out on it, they feel shame.
[01:51:13.954 --> 01:51:14.735]  And some people bubble down.
[01:51:14.755 --> 01:51:17.738]  And by the way, when you watch these videos, almost all the children recoil.
[01:51:19.404 --> 01:51:26.889]  Oh Alex, they were trying to play on their video game, their handheld video games, Nintendos, and the parents were taking the Nintendos out of their hands and saying, look at the drag queen.
[01:51:27.269 --> 01:51:29.351]  So that's, that's all parents' problems.
[01:51:29.571 --> 01:51:31.693]  And this is the problem, it's a sexual implantation.
[01:51:31.953 --> 01:51:37.817]  Now, me, I've looked at porn, I've been desensitized to it, but the first time you see a pair of boobs, I can still remember it like it was yesterday.
[01:51:38.057 --> 01:51:43.901]  The first time you lose your virginity, these are sit- No, they're imprinting them for what they're doing, exactly.
[01:51:44.830 --> 01:51:46.310]  Yeah, you're much more sensitive to it than a young age.
[01:51:46.330 --> 01:51:49.011]  Thank God I was imprinted on stealing my dad's Playboys when I was like 9.
[01:51:49.171 --> 01:51:52.372]  I was like, oh my God, I want this!
[01:51:53.872 --> 01:51:56.513]  I was having to sneak around the bedroom, like find them in the closet.
[01:51:56.773 --> 01:51:58.213]  There was just a girl with her top off.
[01:51:58.593 --> 01:52:04.335]  Imagine, they're little kids being taken to this and being taught that some crazy dude in a clown outfit is who they are.
[01:52:04.635 --> 01:52:05.855]  And people love you all over the world.
[01:52:05.895 --> 01:52:06.616]  That's something I should add.
[01:52:06.936 --> 01:52:11.517]  They love you in India and Russia and China and in Africa.
[01:52:11.557 --> 01:52:12.317]  People love you, brother.
[01:52:13.328 --> 01:52:15.989]  Well, they really don't like me in Germany, because that's where my tweets get reported.
[01:52:16.009 --> 01:52:18.550]  But I just have to say, the thing is, I still remember the Playboy magazine.
[01:52:18.570 --> 01:52:23.731]  I had a Jenny McCarthy Playboy magazine that we had to share, that my buddies would have on the weekend, and I would have it.
[01:52:23.971 --> 01:52:29.993]  But now, with the sexualization of kids, you give them an iPad, they type in, you know, they can find porn, just, you know, copious amounts.
[01:52:30.133 --> 01:52:30.573]  Well, that's it.
[01:52:30.593 --> 01:52:34.874]  I mean, when you're 10 years old, you're like, alright, we all stole these from our dad.
[01:52:34.894 --> 01:52:37.055]  Let's go meet down under the bridge and look at them.
[01:52:37.575 --> 01:52:39.558]  And they're like, oh my god, look at her, look at her.
[01:52:39.878 --> 01:52:44.644]  And that's, you know, that's not adults doing it, it's not pedophilia, it's kids stealing Playboys.
[01:52:44.924 --> 01:52:46.186]  It's just women admiring them.
[01:52:46.586 --> 01:52:53.675]  Imagine how healthy that is, stealing the Playboys and trading them, versus pedophiles coming and kids sitting on their laps.
[01:52:53.735 --> 01:52:55.798]  I mean, it's just light years down a rat hole.
[01:52:57.060 --> 01:53:04.005]  I mean, Alex, the thing is, we didn't have our teachers' Facebook profile, Instagram profile, so now you know your day teachers, day crews.
[01:53:04.225 --> 01:53:13.011]  So you just know your whole backstory of these teachers, and I know we're about to go on a break, but you just gotta make this- Well, by the way, a heterosexual coach doesn't go, yeah, I had sex with my wife today, let me tell you how I have sex.
[01:53:13.111 --> 01:53:15.372]  It's all pedophilic, it's all wrong.
[01:53:16.193 --> 01:53:25.499]  Primetime99, Alex Steins, our guest, InfoWars.com, Alex Jones, your phone calls on the politics, 2022, Trump and more, with Alex Steins straight ahead, stay with us.
[01:53:26.488 --> 01:53:33.192]  The Heights Public Library today debuting a new children's story hour called Drag Queen Storytime.
[01:53:33.332 --> 01:53:34.412]  My name is Blackberry.
[01:53:34.553 --> 01:53:36.013]  I'm a bearded drag queen.
[01:53:36.213 --> 01:53:38.735]  That means I'm a lady with lots of facial hair.
[01:53:38.875 --> 01:53:42.457]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for Drag Queen Storytime.
[01:53:42.537 --> 01:53:43.778]  Drag Queen Storytime.
[01:53:43.898 --> 01:53:50.722]  And we have to warn you, ladies and gentlemen, if you've got young or impressionable children in your household, bring them to the screen right now.
[01:53:52.617 --> 01:53:57.699]  And we witnessed parents taking their children, as young as two, inside to take part.
[01:53:57.819 --> 01:53:59.640]  Talking, singing, and reading.
[01:54:00.240 --> 01:54:01.681]  We can both be grooms!
[01:54:01.801 --> 01:54:05.443]  To an audience of preschoolers, toddlers, and their caregivers.
[01:54:05.603 --> 01:54:09.484]  The hips on the drag queen go swish, swish, swish.
[01:54:09.584 --> 01:54:10.225]  Turn around.
[01:54:11.865 --> 01:54:12.586]  And shake your butt!
[01:54:12.626 --> 01:54:13.866]  Shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em!
[01:54:13.966 --> 01:54:17.128]  It was a first for this branch of the public library, too.
[01:54:17.348 --> 01:54:17.988]  Are you nervous?
[01:54:18.248 --> 01:54:18.488]  Yes.
[01:54:18.528 --> 01:54:19.769]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[01:54:20.825 --> 01:54:21.005]  No.
[01:54:21.646 --> 01:54:27.071]  And for the children and the people that support it are gonna realize that this is gonna be the grooming of the next generation.
[01:54:27.331 --> 01:54:32.656]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[01:54:32.876 --> 01:54:35.999]  No one's there to push an agenda on anyone.
[01:54:36.479 --> 01:54:41.183]  No one's there to persuade people or to recruit people.
[01:54:41.424 --> 01:54:43.626]  Who wants to be a drag queen when they grow up?
[01:54:43.786 --> 01:54:45.407]  You could be a drag queen superhero.
[01:54:49.917 --> 01:54:51.038]  They were all accepting.
[01:54:51.098 --> 01:54:55.581]  They all were happy about it and excited and giving me hugs and everything.
[01:54:55.861 --> 01:54:57.642]  The woman gets up on her table, spreads her legs.
[01:54:57.702 --> 01:54:58.383]  It's a man.
[01:54:58.403 --> 01:55:00.924]  This is adult entertainment.
[01:55:01.144 --> 01:55:03.746]  Most people seem to walk away having a good time.
[01:55:03.826 --> 01:55:04.887]  A stardom young, right?
[01:55:04.987 --> 01:55:06.588]  A stardom young, right?
[01:55:06.668 --> 01:55:07.608]  Anyone can do drag.
[01:55:09.540 --> 01:55:10.801]  Everyone can do drag.
[01:55:10.881 --> 01:55:11.622]  Everyone can do drag.
[01:55:11.662 --> 01:55:12.323]  Teach the children.
[01:55:12.523 --> 01:55:13.544]  Teach the children.
[01:55:14.464 --> 01:55:15.946]  I'm all about education.
[01:55:16.246 --> 01:55:18.848]  I actually do story time with drag queens in Chicago.
[01:55:18.868 --> 01:55:19.009]  Right?
[01:55:20.730 --> 01:55:21.691]  Yes.
[01:55:21.951 --> 01:55:23.713]  Family programming.
[01:55:24.393 --> 01:55:25.074]  Love it.
[01:55:25.254 --> 01:55:25.634]  Yes!
[01:55:25.795 --> 01:55:34.601]  We have just confirmed that a registered child sex offender has been reading to children at a Houston Public Library as part of its Drag Queen Story Hour.
[01:55:34.901 --> 01:55:43.307]  A media spokesperson for the library confirms one of those drag queens, Tatiana Malanina, is really Alberto Garza, a child sex offender.
[01:55:43.627 --> 01:55:46.910]  In 2008, he was convicted of assaulting an 8-year-old boy.
[01:55:47.150 --> 01:55:49.992]  This is Tatiana Balina, my sister from Queens of the Week.
[01:55:50.212 --> 01:55:51.693]  What has this world come to?
[01:55:51.973 --> 01:55:54.435]  It's come to a world where drag kids actually exist.
[01:55:54.515 --> 01:55:55.836]  And people do ketamine on a couch.
[01:55:58.177 --> 01:56:03.580]  Desmond is the world's youngest club kid, and we challenge you, as the people out there, to find a younger club kid.
[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:04.161]  Will they find one?
[01:56:04.981 --> 01:56:05.201]  No.
[01:56:05.402 --> 01:56:12.846]  Please welcome Desmond Napolis, aka Desmond is Amazing!
[01:56:12.906 --> 01:56:13.967]  Have you been to a nightclub?
[01:56:14.347 --> 01:56:14.527]  No.
[01:56:14.827 --> 01:56:14.948]  No?
[01:56:14.868 --> 01:56:15.868]  Okay.
[01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:26.868]   So people all over Twitter, millions of views this week alone, have looked at clips of us
[01:56:26.868 --> 01:56:31.788]   five, six years ago, three years ago, saying Alex Jones is psychic, he's Nostradamus, how
[01:56:31.788 --> 01:56:32.508]  do you know all this?
[01:56:32.508 --> 01:56:33.788]  (sniffles)
[01:56:33.929 --> 01:56:34.270]  Apple!
[01:56:34.470 --> 01:56:34.850]  Google!
[01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:42.373]  State governments, the federal government, the German government, the French government, the UK government, they've all been funding this.
[01:56:42.453 --> 01:56:47.796]  So we knew this was their main assault to normalize pedophilia with children.
[01:56:47.816 --> 01:56:52.839]  And they took over the Catholic Church with pedophiles, they took over the Boy Scouts, Penn State, the list goes on and on.
[01:56:53.179 --> 01:57:00.163]  This is a cult that they get you to accept, you bring them in, they abuse children, and now they try to blackmail you with it.
[01:57:00.683 --> 01:57:02.184]  Alex Stein, that's my view on this.
[01:57:02.244 --> 01:57:04.965]  I want to go to some phone calls with you, but I'm going to ask a lot of the questions here.
[01:57:05.485 --> 01:57:10.628]  What is front and center for you on your radar screen, on your heart right now, you want to talk about?
[01:57:11.724 --> 01:57:16.408]  Well, first thing I want to say, you know, the four words the globalists are most scared of is Alex Jones was right.
[01:57:16.448 --> 01:57:19.190]  And that's a trending hashtag always on Twitter.
[01:57:19.231 --> 01:57:21.472]  So, you know, you're able to foresee all of this.
[01:57:21.733 --> 01:57:29.539]  And I don't want to just kiss your butt, but really anybody with half a brain, not saying that you're not one of the most talented broadcasters ever, but all this is done in plain sight.
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:32.422]  You know, if you're really paying attention, you can actually see the grooming.
[01:57:32.462 --> 01:57:33.543]  You can see their agenda.
[01:57:33.843 --> 01:57:39.048]  The fact that Nancy Pelosi, you know, is so pro-abortion and she's getting communion from the Pope with her husband who has a DUI.
[01:57:39.708 --> 01:57:46.954]  So it's just, it's all in front of our face that they just want to actual murder kids and kids that are born, they want to, you know, obviously, you know, transition them to the opposite sex.
[01:57:47.254 --> 01:58:02.407]  But for me, what's in my radar right now that's coming up is I had a really effective video of me calling out Dan Crenshaw for being a globalist and as well as Ted Cruz, you know, for their support of the Ukraine, you know, spending their $80 billion and giving that to Ukraine instead of fixing our border.
[01:58:02.607 --> 01:58:07.852]  There was just 40 immigrants, excuse me, 42 immigrants that died in a hot trailer outside of San Antonio, Texas.
[01:58:08.173 --> 01:58:08.714]  It's actually 52 now.
[01:58:08.734 --> 01:58:08.855]  52 now.
[01:58:11.644 --> 01:58:11.965]  52 now.
[01:58:11.985 --> 01:58:13.766]  I think some of them were alive when they found them.
[01:58:14.006 --> 01:58:21.012]  So 50 people are dying and all these people are giving 80 billion dollars and worrying about the border between the Ukraine and Russia.
[01:58:21.292 --> 01:58:25.656]  Yeah, we have a massive problem with our border that has more holes than Swiss cheese.
[01:58:25.976 --> 01:58:28.558]  And they are actually killing people by them neglecting it.
[01:58:28.598 --> 01:58:30.880]  So for me, I'm going to go to Washington, D.C.
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:33.942]  and I'm going to call out all of these on the right and left.
[01:58:34.263 --> 01:58:39.327]  If you voted to give money to the Ukraine, I'm sorry, I got to call you out because we have serious issues.
[01:58:39.407 --> 01:58:40.728]  I've lost friends to drugs over there.
[01:58:40.828 --> 01:58:44.532]  Well, Crenshaw contacted a very well-known podcaster and wanted to talk to me.
[01:58:44.552 --> 01:58:45.512]  And I said, fine, I'll meet with you.
[01:58:45.552 --> 01:58:46.694]  But then he had chickened out.
[01:58:47.114 --> 01:58:48.735]  He's like, why is Alex lying about me?
[01:58:49.176 --> 01:58:53.080]  He got up a month ago and said, I actually have the most conservative voting record.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.221]  Don't listen to MTG.
[01:58:54.261 --> 01:58:54.781]  He's a fake.
[01:58:54.881 --> 01:58:55.782]  I've checked the voting records.
[01:58:55.822 --> 01:58:56.503]  He's a liar.
[01:58:57.123 --> 01:58:59.165]  So Dan, your problem is, OK, you got an eye patch.
[01:58:59.185 --> 01:58:59.806]  You're a veteran.
[01:58:59.846 --> 01:59:00.086]  Great.
[01:59:00.987 --> 01:59:03.890]  We love veterans, but we don't love veterans like Benedict Arnold.
[01:59:05.086 --> 01:59:11.310]  100%!
[01:59:05.146 --> 01:59:11.310]  And listen, I support the guys in uniform, but I don't necessarily support the uniform being the world police.
[01:59:11.410 --> 01:59:12.390]  I don't support it.
[01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:13.411]  I'm not a neocon.
[01:59:13.471 --> 01:59:22.096]  I don't want us to go and kill people for the military-industrial complex so people can literally get rich on their stock trading and buying these weapons.
[01:59:22.416 --> 01:59:28.460]  I care about the American people that are in that uniform, that are going to fight wars that they don't get to choose, all because they want to get a college education.
[01:59:29.801 --> 01:59:37.908]  I totally agree with you.
[01:59:39.410 --> 01:59:41.571]  We'll play that Crenshaw clip starting the next segment.
[01:59:41.612 --> 01:59:45.415]  Let's take some phone calls on Trump running for president.
[01:59:45.435 --> 01:59:46.916]  The word is he is going to announce Monday.
[01:59:47.297 --> 01:59:50.399]  He may have tactical flexibility, as Roger said.
[01:59:50.419 --> 01:59:51.080]  He may not do it.
[01:59:51.120 --> 01:59:55.004]   But right now, Big exclusive videos on Infowars.com.
[01:59:55.044 --> 01:59:55.525]  Exclusive.
[01:59:55.565 --> 01:59:57.467]  Find it at Infowars.com and share it.
[01:59:57.487 --> 02:00:00.970]  Trump set to announce, Trump set to announce this Monday, July 4th.
[02:00:01.351 --> 02:00:02.192]  Who's been holding the longest?
[02:00:02.232 --> 02:00:02.732]  Is it Matt?
[02:00:02.853 --> 02:00:03.533]  Is it Brandon?
[02:00:04.214 --> 02:00:04.855]  Is it Joel?
[02:00:04.975 --> 02:00:05.575]  Is it Honey?
[02:00:06.396 --> 02:00:11.182]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Matt in New York.
[02:00:11.202 --> 02:00:13.164]  You're on the air with Alex Stein.
[02:00:14.341 --> 02:00:15.662]  Yeah, baby, let's go!
[02:00:17.284 --> 02:00:20.186]  Yo, I can't get that out of my head.
[02:00:20.286 --> 02:00:22.829]  And real quick, you gotta give the Democrats a satire video.
[02:00:23.029 --> 02:00:29.474]  What do you think about that one?
[02:00:29.494 --> 02:00:30.836]  That would be hilarious.
[02:00:30.936 --> 02:00:33.758]  Alex Jones with a black tongue just licking Democrat tears?
[02:00:33.818 --> 02:00:34.699]  That'd be great.
[02:00:34.959 --> 02:00:37.562]  But anyway, yeah, I think it's great Trump's getting back in.
[02:00:37.902 --> 02:00:39.383]  I mean, we gotta cut him a little slack.
[02:00:39.423 --> 02:00:40.764]  He rolled out the death shot.
[02:00:40.784 --> 02:00:44.448]   He gave us uh... ventilators without a ninety percent kill rate we had
[02:00:44.448 --> 02:00:46.887]   one infection down to about a half a percent
[02:00:46.887 --> 02:00:50.587]   i mean give a little blackie we want a little bit right by the
[02:00:50.587 --> 02:00:54.548]   at the couple little things we got it we got it just thought that i have a brain
[02:00:54.548 --> 02:00:59.967]   i'd just get ready for a roller coaster ride but he's coming back and they got a form the new america
[02:00:59.967 --> 02:01:02.988]   that's right they got hurt all the patriot that the texas
[02:01:02.988 --> 02:01:05.168]   and florida and then they're gonna have
[02:01:05.168 --> 02:01:09.488]   all the nazis that infiltrate south america form up with the texting
[02:01:09.488 --> 02:01:12.488]  and that they're going to wipe out and you're on fire.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:13.380]  You're on fire.
[02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:17.701]  But if you can show me Trump flew a Lita Express, I will not support him ever.
[02:01:18.221 --> 02:01:19.701]  I'm mad at him about the poison shot.
[02:01:19.941 --> 02:01:20.901]  That you said is true.
[02:01:21.321 --> 02:01:24.682]  The second thing you said, where's the proof Trump flew a Lita Express?
[02:01:24.722 --> 02:01:25.922]  He's not on those phone logs.
[02:01:26.222 --> 02:01:27.202]  He's not on those flight logs.
[02:01:27.562 --> 02:01:27.982]  Excuse me?
[02:01:32.096 --> 02:01:35.084]  Wasn't that confirmed that he was at the Island six times?
[02:01:35.145 --> 02:01:38.033]  Not on the Bolivia Express, but he was on Epstein Island six times.
[02:01:38.053 --> 02:01:39.015]  Wasn't that confirmed?
[02:01:39.176 --> 02:01:40.439]  Alex Stein, you see any proof of that?
[02:01:41.303 --> 02:01:47.886]  Well, supposedly there's some story that he wasn't on the actual Lolita Express, that he was on a plane with Jeffrey Epstein one time, supposedly.
[02:01:47.906 --> 02:01:49.187]  But listen, it doesn't matter.
[02:01:49.447 --> 02:01:51.308]  Nobody's going to be perfect, but this is what does matter.
[02:01:51.568 --> 02:02:05.354]  Did you see there's a viral video of Marina Abramovich talking about how, and she's a Satanist, and we're going to have to go to break very soon, but she talked about how there were some shamans that were high on drugs, and they were actually saying that they wanted Trump because Trump will bring the most chaos.
[02:02:05.635 --> 02:02:10.317]  So, you know, Lord knows they probably want Trump to come back because they want to have another summer of love.
[02:02:11.478 --> 02:02:12.419]  I'm going to say this.
[02:02:12.859 --> 02:02:13.479]  I studied this.
[02:02:14.060 --> 02:02:17.083]  Trump was never on the leave express according to flight logs.
[02:02:17.543 --> 02:02:22.767]  The Democrats have confused it just like they say that Trump grabbed the wheel of the Secret Service limo.
[02:02:22.988 --> 02:02:23.668]  It's not true.
[02:02:24.109 --> 02:02:25.410]  Just like I have a black tongue.
[02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:26.070]  It's not true.
[02:02:26.110 --> 02:02:28.652]  Or I talked to Trump on January 5th or 6th.
[02:02:28.713 --> 02:02:29.233]  Not true.
[02:02:29.673 --> 02:02:32.596]  Hadn't talked to Trump for over a year whenever that went down.
[02:02:32.876 --> 02:02:33.877]  All right, thank you, Matt.
[02:02:34.437 --> 02:02:35.398]  I hear your points, though.
[02:02:35.758 --> 02:02:40.742]  Honey, Joel, Bob, Brandon, straight ahead with primetime Alex Stein.
[02:02:40.762 --> 02:02:41.182]  Stay with us.
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:44.501]  Eyepatch McCain!
[02:02:44.621 --> 02:02:45.902]  Eyepatch McCain!
[02:02:46.202 --> 02:02:48.264]  Look at Eyepatch McCain right here!
[02:02:48.544 --> 02:02:50.365]  You're a rhino, you're a globalist!
[02:02:50.605 --> 02:02:52.605]  You're a globalist right now!
[02:02:52.605 --> 02:02:54.605]  You're a globalist right now!
[02:02:54.605 --> 02:02:56.605]  King, you're a globalist right now!
[02:02:56.605 --> 02:02:58.605]  I pass for King!
[02:02:58.605 --> 02:03:00.605]  I pass for King!
[02:03:00.605 --> 02:03:02.605]  I pass for King!
[02:03:02.895 --> 02:03:04.895]  You're a violent assassin!
[02:03:04.895 --> 02:03:06.895]  You're a violent assassin!
[02:03:06.895 --> 02:03:08.895]  You're a violent assassin!
[02:03:08.895 --> 02:03:10.895]  You're a violent assassin!
[02:03:10.895 --> 02:03:12.895]  You're a violent assassin!
[02:03:12.895 --> 02:03:14.895]  You're a violent assassin!
[02:03:14.895 --> 02:03:16.895]  You're a violent assassin!
[02:03:16.895 --> 02:03:18.895]  Look at people attacking Alex Stein for being at a hotel.
[02:03:19.304 --> 02:03:27.568]  You know, the more I think about it, it takes a lot of gall for eyepatch McCain to attack moms who are worried about baby formula as, quote, pro-Russia.
[02:03:27.588 --> 02:03:30.049]  I mean, that's probably one of the most outrageous things I think I've ever heard.
[02:03:32.589 --> 02:03:33.630]  So, there you go.
[02:03:33.650 --> 02:03:44.056]  I mean, that footage, radio listeners couldn't see it, but it's it's I. Patrick Cain's people attacking Alex Stein for just asking him questions and punching him and shoving him against the wall.
[02:03:44.516 --> 02:03:45.177]  How dare you?
[02:03:45.557 --> 02:03:51.300]  But let me answer the question of the last caller saying, Trump flew on Alita Express, which means he flew to the island.
[02:03:51.901 --> 02:03:53.081]  Nope, we have the flight logs.
[02:03:53.101 --> 02:03:54.762]  They've all been checked on that airplane.
[02:03:55.643 --> 02:04:08.479]   In 1997, they shared a flight from Newark Into Palm Beach, and that's the only time they ever flew, was 25 years ago.
[02:04:09.059 --> 02:04:13.321]  Donald Trump on his plane to Palm Beach when he was invited on it.
[02:04:14.282 --> 02:04:18.564]  And if I find Trump was on that island or any of this, he says he hasn't been, I'll be against Trump.
[02:04:19.044 --> 02:04:20.405]  But that's leftist rumors.
[02:04:20.985 --> 02:04:23.227]  Just like they say, Trump hates Mexicans.
[02:04:23.247 --> 02:04:23.727]  Where's the video?
[02:04:25.265 --> 02:04:26.626]  Trump says all Mexicans are criminals.
[02:04:26.646 --> 02:04:27.466]  Where's the video?
[02:04:27.866 --> 02:04:29.227]  Or Alex Jones is a white supremacist.
[02:04:29.247 --> 02:04:30.448]  Or Alex Jones says he's a fake.
[02:04:30.988 --> 02:04:31.688]  Where's the video?
[02:04:31.708 --> 02:04:35.150]  Yeah, do they at socialite events where they photograph together probably ten times?
[02:04:35.270 --> 02:04:35.751]  Absolutely.
[02:04:36.411 --> 02:04:38.692]  I go off what Trump does, Roe v. Wade, you name it.
[02:04:39.012 --> 02:04:39.773]  I'm not defending Trump.
[02:04:39.813 --> 02:04:40.553]  I'm pissed at Trump.
[02:04:40.934 --> 02:04:42.955]  But I just want to actually attack on real issues.
[02:04:43.015 --> 02:04:43.395]  Alex Stein?
[02:04:45.157 --> 02:04:46.038]  Well, thank you for having me.
[02:04:46.058 --> 02:04:59.108]  You know, in that video, I put Tucker Carlson at the end, you know, he called, he coined the phrase, phrase, eyepatch McCain, because Dan Crenshaw was complaining about mothers that were complaining about not having formula to feed their baby and calling them puppets for Putin.
[02:04:59.409 --> 02:05:01.610]  And I want to say my biological father is Tucker Carlson.
[02:05:01.650 --> 02:05:02.871]  He's a huge fan of yours.
[02:05:02.911 --> 02:05:08.516]  And I have to give him a lot of credit because every, what happened after that video, Dan Crenshaw called all the left-wing media.
[02:05:08.796 --> 02:05:16.002]   He had Adam Kinzinger, Jake Tapper, Media running coverage for him saying that I assaulted him, saying that I'm a member of the Proud Boys.
[02:05:16.262 --> 02:05:20.405]  It was all lies because there's other angles where we had about four people filming.
[02:05:20.805 --> 02:05:22.847]  It proves that they are the ones that assaulted me.
[02:05:22.887 --> 02:05:24.848]  And so I'm going to end up filing a lawsuit against him.
[02:05:24.888 --> 02:05:30.312]  I just kind of waited to see if he was going to, you know, try to, you know, pull some sort of legal scam himself.
[02:05:30.633 --> 02:05:33.535]  But I'm going to go after Dan Crenshaw because he's he's a liar.
[02:05:33.575 --> 02:05:34.315]  He's a rhino.
[02:05:34.436 --> 02:05:38.759]  All the people that came out in his favor, Alex, were all the left wing lying media.
[02:05:39.339 --> 02:05:40.080]  That says it all.
[02:05:40.340 --> 02:05:41.621]  The people that defend you the most.
[02:05:41.962 --> 02:05:44.264]  And people, you know, on the right aren't defending him.
[02:05:44.324 --> 02:05:49.789]  As a matter of fact, this is at the, you know, this is at the GOP conference convention in Houston, Texas.
[02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:54.974]  And everybody there, universally, Alex, did not like Dan Crenshaw.
[02:05:55.254 --> 02:05:57.156]  Well, he has no instincts.
[02:05:57.256 --> 02:05:58.177]  He has no instincts.
[02:05:58.557 --> 02:06:02.501]  The fact that he thinks going on CNN will make him popular with Republicans?
[02:06:02.541 --> 02:06:03.242]  He's an idiot!
[02:06:04.503 --> 02:06:13.087]  And Alex, he was so, he has such thin skin, he at-tweeted me and called me a little boy, I'm about two feet taller than him, and said I can't get a girlfriend.
[02:06:13.387 --> 02:06:14.088]  All fake!
[02:06:14.228 --> 02:06:15.548]  I have too many girlfriends!
[02:06:15.568 --> 02:06:17.149]  I have too many issues with women!
[02:06:17.189 --> 02:06:18.230]  My size can't get one!
[02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:20.871]  I will vouch for that, Alex.
[02:06:20.931 --> 02:06:23.052]  I'm not gay, but you are a good-looking, tall guy.
[02:06:23.072 --> 02:06:27.034]  So the point is, yeah, the idea that you can't get women is preposterous.
[02:06:27.757 --> 02:06:32.439]  I mean, and it's just nanny nanny boo boo, like some sort of middle school insult.
[02:06:32.679 --> 02:06:34.299]  This guy is a politician.
[02:06:34.339 --> 02:06:36.560]  He's making major decisions.
[02:06:36.840 --> 02:06:38.981]  He needs to have some professionalism, but he doesn't have it.
[02:06:39.021 --> 02:06:46.223]  Just like when that 17-year-old girl called him to the carpet for saying that Jesus is like Superman, and he totally melted down.
[02:06:46.463 --> 02:07:02.527]   So this guy, just because he's a war veteran, Let me say this about Crenshaw.
[02:07:03.027 --> 02:07:05.427]  I don't usually get on bandwagons because everybody hates him.
[02:07:05.467 --> 02:07:06.448]  I've just tried to sit back.
[02:07:06.908 --> 02:07:07.988]  People really hate him.
[02:07:08.448 --> 02:07:10.188]  I mean, I'm at dinner with former liberals.
[02:07:10.228 --> 02:07:11.169]  They hate Dan Crenshaw.
[02:07:11.189 --> 02:07:14.209]  People are like, why aren't you going after Crenshaw more?
[02:07:15.029 --> 02:07:17.990]  I don't know how the hell he won a seat in Texas.
[02:07:19.113 --> 02:07:21.955]  No, I mean, I'm telling you, Alex, because I teased Ted Cruz.
[02:07:21.995 --> 02:07:23.336]  I was a little mad at Ted Cruz.
[02:07:23.596 --> 02:07:29.039]  Because listen, you know, when the power went out, I had to pay for my mom's hotel for five days at the Holiday Inn Express.
[02:07:29.059 --> 02:07:30.019]  It was her apartment.
[02:07:30.059 --> 02:07:31.000]  We had rolling blackouts.
[02:07:31.040 --> 02:07:32.521]  The first time that's ever happened in my life.
[02:07:32.801 --> 02:07:34.302]  And listen, he's allowed to go on his vacation.
[02:07:34.582 --> 02:07:38.165]  But he went to Cancun and then realized how bad of a look it was and flew back the next day.
[02:07:38.406 --> 02:07:39.487]  So I just want to call him out.
[02:07:39.547 --> 02:07:46.153]  And I'm going to actually see Ted Cruz in Tampa at the Turning Point event, and I'm going to go and try to talk to him in a very calm manner.
[02:07:46.173 --> 02:07:46.893]  I'm not going to call him out.
[02:07:47.154 --> 02:07:49.656]  But Dan Crenshaw, I'm saying, I got kickback for Ted Cruz.
[02:07:49.896 --> 02:07:52.158]  I got no kickback for Dan Crenshaw.
[02:07:52.318 --> 02:07:56.042]  A matter of fact, he said, Ted Cruz is a lot better than I think Ted Cruz.
[02:07:57.910 --> 02:08:01.973]  The overall is good, he has some problems, but no, Crenshaw is really, really bad news.
[02:08:02.013 --> 02:08:04.315]  I mean, look, Saturday Night Live loves him.
[02:08:05.116 --> 02:08:06.577]  All of them love him, what does that tell you?
[02:08:07.017 --> 02:08:08.639]  All right, very powerful information.
[02:08:08.659 --> 02:08:09.359]  Let's take another call.
[02:08:09.739 --> 02:08:12.702]  Let's talk to Brandon in California.
[02:08:12.722 --> 02:08:13.482]  Let's go, Brandon.
[02:08:13.502 --> 02:08:14.123]  Welcome, Brandon.
[02:08:16.725 --> 02:08:17.546]  Hello, Alex.
[02:08:18.186 --> 02:08:18.547]  Yes, sir.
[02:08:18.587 --> 02:08:21.049]  I'm live from California.
[02:08:22.370 --> 02:08:26.393]  Listen, I just wanted to say that as much as I like Trump, he's pretty old.
[02:08:27.535 --> 02:08:32.358]  He's 76, and I don't care who you are, there ain't a man over 60 that ain't somewhat senile.
[02:08:33.179 --> 02:08:40.963]  And, uh, I don't know if... I mean, he's got the backing, he's got the support, and he does... he is sort of a savant in some ways.
[02:08:41.864 --> 02:08:59.323]   But, uh, I don't know if he has the discernment to really tackle the New World Order, because it is a scientific... I mean, these are mad scientists who are trying to openly depopulate the planet, take over, and I don't know if he can open his eyes to that.
[02:08:59.323 --> 02:09:05.162]   I don't know, he just doesn't seem to be too awake to that reality.
[02:09:05.162 --> 02:09:06.601]  So I don't know.
[02:09:06.601 --> 02:09:07.601]  I don't know, man.
[02:09:07.601 --> 02:09:08.601]  I think we need someone younger.
[02:09:08.601 --> 02:09:12.323]   I think we need someone fiery, someone maybe in their 40s or 50s.
[02:09:12.323 --> 02:09:13.323]  But, uh...
[02:09:13.323 --> 02:09:16.323]  What do you think of DeSantis?
[02:09:16.323 --> 02:09:17.323]  DeSantis?
[02:09:17.323 --> 02:09:19.842]  I mean, yeah, I think he's solid.
[02:09:20.089 --> 02:09:24.410]  I think, if anything, Trump should just back him up, give him all the support.
[02:09:24.430 --> 02:09:26.171]  Yeah, that's like Alex Stein said, be a kingmaker.
[02:09:26.251 --> 02:09:30.973]  Well, regardless, it comes from very sources, high-level sources that talk directly with Trump.
[02:09:31.393 --> 02:09:35.634]  He is currently planning to announce 2024 run on July 4th.
[02:09:35.695 --> 02:09:38.436]  Now, he may change that, but currently, that's the big news.
[02:09:39.416 --> 02:09:42.877]  Well, he's got to run on more than just fixing the economy and the border.
[02:09:42.897 --> 02:09:47.639]  He's got to run hard against these ancient reptilian vampires at the top of the pyramid.
[02:09:48.303 --> 02:09:57.491]  And he needs a team of people that can help him see that and try to actually legally, you know, pursue justice.
[02:09:57.551 --> 02:09:59.313]  Because these people are legit murderers.
[02:09:59.513 --> 02:10:00.114]  I hear you.
[02:10:00.134 --> 02:10:00.995]  Great points, Brandon.
[02:10:01.015 --> 02:10:01.595]  Thanks for holding.
[02:10:01.975 --> 02:10:03.096]  Let's jam in another call.
[02:10:03.136 --> 02:10:05.879]  Let's talk to Joel in California.
[02:10:05.899 --> 02:10:07.300]  You're on the air with Alex Stein.
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:07.761]  Go ahead.
[02:10:08.762 --> 02:10:09.682]  Yeah, in California.
[02:10:09.742 --> 02:10:10.143]  Exactly.
[02:10:10.283 --> 02:10:16.795]   Alex, before we talk, I really just want to say I want to thank you for being one of the only people that fucking celebrates God.
[02:10:17.275 --> 02:10:22.219]  Unabashedly, unapologetically, you're just fucking... Please don't cuss again or I'll let you go.
[02:10:22.819 --> 02:10:23.920]  We already had to delay it twice.
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:24.800]  Just don't cuss again.
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:26.141]  I do celebrate God.
[02:10:26.541 --> 02:10:28.062]  I'm not perfect, but I know God's real.
[02:10:28.082 --> 02:10:29.023]  I want to be on God's side.
[02:10:29.063 --> 02:10:29.944]  I want to be with Jesus.
[02:10:30.324 --> 02:10:31.004]  You're absolutely right.
[02:10:31.044 --> 02:10:35.727]  What's your view on Trump reportedly set to announce 2024 run next Monday?
[02:10:37.068 --> 02:10:40.771]  I absolutely apologize for doing that and I regret it.
[02:10:41.694 --> 02:10:44.254]   I think that this stance is sort of being used against Trump.
[02:10:44.254 --> 02:10:47.533]  Go ahead.
[02:10:47.533 --> 02:10:49.054]  Well, I think he's got a point.
[02:10:49.054 --> 02:10:53.053]   They are pinning them against each other to try to eat their own.
[02:10:53.053 --> 02:10:55.053]  That is the strategy the left is using, 100%.
[02:10:55.053 --> 02:10:56.734]  So you're on the air, Joel.
[02:10:56.734 --> 02:10:57.533]  We want to hear your take.
[02:10:57.533 --> 02:10:57.934]  Go ahead.
[02:10:57.934 --> 02:11:03.053]   Yeah, I'm being a little bit reserved because I'm almost afraid I'm going to curse again,
[02:11:03.053 --> 02:11:05.053]  because I've been on hold for over 45 minutes.
[02:11:05.053 --> 02:11:09.294]   I don't know if you've ever called into a radio show before when you were young and unknowing.
[02:11:09.391 --> 02:11:10.772]  I understand you're fired up, brother.
[02:11:10.792 --> 02:11:11.832]  You're on the air now.
[02:11:11.852 --> 02:11:12.873]  We all have called in.
[02:11:13.033 --> 02:11:14.513]  Alex has called into a radio show.
[02:11:14.533 --> 02:11:16.834]  Yes, we've both called into radio shows in our life.
[02:11:16.874 --> 02:11:17.535]  Yes.
[02:11:17.835 --> 02:11:29.199]  I actually tweeted directly to DeSantis and told him that like, yes, even though you are the better candidate on paper, you're being used against Donald Trump, who is the more effective candidate.
[02:11:29.219 --> 02:11:30.380]  They're more afraid of Trump.
[02:11:31.007 --> 02:11:33.968]  They can use you against the Republican Party.
[02:11:35.949 --> 02:11:38.589]  But you do have concerns about Trump, or you don't?
[02:11:40.490 --> 02:11:41.010]  Honestly, no.
[02:11:41.050 --> 02:11:44.531]  I think that they're so afraid of Trump that they show that, like, he's the most effective candidate.
[02:11:45.072 --> 02:11:49.413]  The concerns that they express show their fear.
[02:11:50.117 --> 02:11:51.278]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[02:11:51.298 --> 02:11:58.323]  We're going to do five more minutes with Honey and Bob, Honey Bob, Bob Honey, on the other side with Alex Stein, 99.

[02:12:47.670 --> 02:12:48.270]  Love you all.
[02:12:48.330 --> 02:12:51.042]   Take action and Hi Alex.
[02:12:51.062 --> 02:12:51.322]  God bless you.
[02:12:51.342 --> 02:12:51.863]  Thank you for having me.
[02:12:51.883 --> 02:12:53.624]  I wanted to discuss Trump running again.
[02:12:53.484 --> 02:12:58.444]   straight ahead. Alex Stein is our guest, he'll host a little bit of the next segment to
[02:12:58.444 --> 02:13:04.163]   rear that exclusive with Trump insider Roger Stone saying he's getting ready to run and
[02:13:04.163 --> 02:13:09.724]   we're getting ready to announce it next week. Honey in New York, you're on the air
[02:13:09.724 --> 02:13:15.244]   with Alex Stein and Alex Jones, go ahead. Hi Alex, God bless you, thank you for having me.
[02:13:15.244 --> 02:13:20.314]  I wanted to discuss Trump running again and can you hear me?
[02:13:20.314 --> 02:13:23.310]   I absolutely can Go ahead.
[02:13:24.431 --> 02:13:25.331]  Thank you so much.
[02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:31.253]  I think first he does have to go through a mea culpa immediately, actually.
[02:13:31.273 --> 02:13:47.577]  He has to, if he is elected, he has to pardon the people that were in January 6th that have pled guilty just to get out of solitary confinement, the nonviolent people who were escorted through the Capitol by the police, by the Capitol Police.
[02:13:48.027 --> 02:13:51.629]  And some of them are even still in prison today in D.C.
[02:13:52.069 --> 02:13:55.411]  They are political prisoners and he has to address that immediately.
[02:13:55.872 --> 02:13:58.013]  The second other mea culpa is you guys.
[02:13:58.613 --> 02:14:09.619]  You know, uh, patient zero, Milo Yiannopoulos, you, Gavin, Laura Loomer, the discrimination against conservatives speaking in social media, losing their jobs, losing their businesses.
[02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:11.701]  He has to address that.
[02:14:11.801 --> 02:14:17.664]  You guys put him in office the first time and all of you are now these outcasts in the shadow.
[02:14:18.351 --> 02:14:19.171]  And that's not right.
[02:14:19.872 --> 02:14:23.073]  Because you all got him elected and you may get him elected again.
[02:14:23.334 --> 02:14:24.414]  And he has to address that.
[02:14:24.894 --> 02:14:30.577]  Secondly, the mistakes of the lockdown and the mandatory vaccination, he started that.
[02:14:30.958 --> 02:14:37.541]  We need to have better controls, better legislation on something like this happening again.
[02:14:38.121 --> 02:14:43.344]  Any virus will potentially kill immunocompromised and elderly people.
[02:14:43.824 --> 02:14:44.985]  Any virus could do that.
[02:14:45.425 --> 02:14:56.353]   We cannot shut down the country I totally agree with you, and I'm not trying to endorse Trump because I've had a lot of problems with him, but I'll say this.
[02:14:56.734 --> 02:15:00.535]  The Democrats have a cult that would drink cyanide if Joe Biden told them to.
[02:15:00.895 --> 02:15:03.676]  With Trump, his base at the rallies is mad about the shot.
[02:15:04.036 --> 02:15:07.918]  If he got back in, there's no way his base is putting up with him trying more of this.
[02:15:07.958 --> 02:15:08.998]  What do you think, Alex Stein?
[02:15:09.259 --> 02:15:09.979]  Thanks for the call, honey.
[02:15:10.996 --> 02:15:12.537]  No, I mean, Alex, you just nailed it.
[02:15:12.557 --> 02:15:14.138]  I mean, Trump could fix all these problems.
[02:15:14.178 --> 02:15:15.479]  He could pardon Julian Assange.
[02:15:15.499 --> 02:15:19.022]  He could fix the January 6th problem, you know, within his first week in office.
[02:15:19.042 --> 02:15:21.443]  So that's why he's going to be a great candidate if he wins.
[02:15:21.804 --> 02:15:22.784]  I mean, nobody's perfect.
[02:15:22.804 --> 02:15:26.787]  You know, he got some bad advice from people trying to appease to both sides.
[02:15:27.207 --> 02:15:32.351]  But I think if he gets Trump 2.0, the sequel will be better than the original, in my opinion.
[02:15:32.631 --> 02:15:33.832]  But I'd be happy with DeSantis.
[02:15:33.872 --> 02:15:36.974]  Who else do you like out there as a Republican candidate, Alex?
[02:15:37.315 --> 02:15:37.775]  That's all.
[02:15:38.015 --> 02:15:38.856]  Alex, that's it.
[02:15:38.896 --> 02:15:40.557]  We got DeSantis and we got Trump.
[02:15:40.577 --> 02:15:42.399]  But the sad thing is none of that matters.
[02:15:42.419 --> 02:15:46.922]  The 2,000 mules, these people can cheat again and they can, you know, some other disease and come out.
[02:15:46.962 --> 02:15:49.224]  So that's the thing is the game is rigged in their favor.
[02:15:49.284 --> 02:15:50.445]  Their finger is on the scale.
[02:15:50.745 --> 02:15:52.406]  So we could have the best candidate in the world.
[02:15:52.446 --> 02:15:53.487]  We could have Alex Jones.
[02:15:53.527 --> 02:15:55.949]  You could be running for president and they wouldn't let you win.
[02:15:56.189 --> 02:15:56.769]  I'm serious.
[02:15:56.809 --> 02:15:57.550]  So you know this.
[02:15:57.570 --> 02:15:59.910]  It doesn't matter how likable and how popular you are.
[02:16:00.090 --> 02:16:03.272]  Donald Trump clearly was more popular than Joe Biden.
[02:16:03.352 --> 02:16:17.417]  If you go and you see all these man on the street videos, not just the ones I do, but anybody else does, if you ask the black community, the Asian community, Mexican, it doesn't matter what community, white community, they all say they miss Trump because they do not like paying $5 a gallon of gas.
[02:16:17.657 --> 02:16:18.917]  So Trump was liked then.
[02:16:19.197 --> 02:16:20.098]  He's still liked.
[02:16:20.438 --> 02:16:24.120]   But sadly, they can rig the game and they can Yeah, that's right.
[02:16:24.160 --> 02:16:33.329]  Well, in closing, how does everybody, not that we gotta look for it, it's all over the place, despite the censors, you're overpowering them with your sheer comedy and will.
[02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:35.451]  How do people find Alex Stein online?
[02:16:36.533 --> 02:16:44.097]  Well, I'm all over Alex Stein, 99 on Twitter, I'm on Instagram, Primetime Stein, I'm on YouTube, and I'm probably not going to be there long because I'm getting effective.
[02:16:44.117 --> 02:16:46.138]  They're probably going to take me out just like they took you out.
[02:16:46.198 --> 02:16:47.238]  It's a hard realization.
[02:16:47.658 --> 02:16:52.060]  And that's why we do need somebody in office, hopefully DeSantis, hopefully Trump, that will reinstate you.
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:54.261]  And Elon Musk, I hope he reinstates you.
[02:16:54.301 --> 02:17:00.984]  I'm not holding out hope because I don't put my, you know, liking a politician or liking a celebrity is like thinking the stripper actually likes you, Alex.
[02:17:01.245 --> 02:17:02.425]  We have to like ourselves.
[02:17:02.445 --> 02:17:04.026]  We have to take, you know, their autonomy.
[02:17:04.206 --> 02:17:06.987]  Don't put your faith in man, but in God and your own action as well.
[02:17:07.368 --> 02:17:08.768]  Alex Stein, thank you so much.
[02:17:08.848 --> 02:17:09.569]  Great interview.
[02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:10.569]  Appreciate you.
[02:17:10.609 --> 02:17:13.131]  And I just can't wait to see what next exploit you engage in.
[02:17:13.151 --> 02:17:13.691]  Thank you so much.
[02:17:13.731 --> 02:17:14.151]  Godspeed.
[02:17:15.132 --> 02:17:15.512]  Thank you.
[02:17:16.112 --> 02:17:18.513]  Bob in Texas, final caller, and then I hand the baton.
[02:17:18.934 --> 02:17:20.955]  Everybody knows that I don't cry wolf.
[02:17:21.295 --> 02:17:25.217]  Everybody knows that 95% of the time what I tell you turns out to be true.
[02:17:25.997 --> 02:17:40.214]   Donald Trump told a certain well-known political operative who's good friends with him, Three days ago, he's going to announce for president 2024, Monday in five days.
[02:17:41.615 --> 02:17:43.377]  Implications of that are massive.
[02:17:43.857 --> 02:17:52.823]  I was hit during the Roger Stone interview by that and shocked that I made some behind the scenes connections and confirmed, but Trump calls it technical.
[02:17:55.373 --> 02:17:56.833]  Technical flexibility.
[02:17:57.553 --> 02:17:59.974]  He may not do it on Monday, but we know he's doing it.
[02:18:00.014 --> 02:18:00.614]  He is running.
[02:18:01.034 --> 02:18:04.015]  Just that fact is so ultra-massive.
[02:18:04.475 --> 02:18:09.416]  I'm going to take a final call from Bob in Texas, then we'll go to Kate Daly, great co-host, knocks you out of the park every week.
[02:18:09.856 --> 02:18:10.756]  I hate to cut into her time.
[02:18:10.796 --> 02:18:11.976]  She's always such an amazing guest.
[02:18:12.316 --> 02:18:19.758]  We're going to go to her here in a few minutes, but I wanted to play a few minutes from that hour one interview that's now on InfoWars.com and Bandai Video.
[02:18:19.778 --> 02:18:20.338]  I hope you share.
[02:18:21.774 --> 02:18:24.316]  I think he announces sooner rather than later.
[02:18:24.416 --> 02:18:26.297]  I think he announces as early as July.
[02:18:26.317 --> 02:18:31.281]  I think these kind of attacks probably accelerate that, if anything.
[02:18:31.941 --> 02:18:38.346]  DeSantis needs to stick to his knitting and get re-elected governor before he could move out openly in a presidential campaign.
[02:18:38.846 --> 02:18:41.848]  I do think he is sizing up, taking on the champ.
[02:18:42.446 --> 02:18:50.733]  In all honesty, Alex, as I've said here on the program before, I expected the president to wait till after the midterms, but to become a candidate fairly early.
[02:18:50.552 --> 02:18:51.552]  race to lose.
[02:18:51.552 --> 02:18:55.552]   In all honesty, Alex, as I've said here on the program before, I expected the president
[02:18:55.552 --> 02:19:00.471]   to wait until after the midterms, but to become a candidate fairly early.
[02:19:00.471 --> 02:19:06.471]   I now believe that he could be accelerating his time frame because all of these attempts
[02:19:06.465 --> 02:19:08.685]  Trump is prepared to pull the trigger on Monday.
[02:19:08.504 --> 02:19:10.704]  of the political attacks there are.
[02:19:10.704 --> 02:19:14.143]   And the reason they're attacking him is because they don't want him to run.
[02:19:14.143 --> 02:19:17.824]  So therefore he will defy them, I think, by running.
[02:19:17.824 --> 02:19:23.744]  I do think it could be as early as the first week of July.
[02:19:23.744 --> 02:19:26.183]  And then we went on and had discussions on and off air.
[02:19:26.183 --> 02:19:29.264]  Trump is prepared to pull the trigger on Monday.
[02:19:29.264 --> 02:19:30.264]  That's the plan.
[02:19:30.264 --> 02:19:33.703]  So big news, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:19:33.743 --> 02:19:38.224]  He may change his mind, but it is certainly gigantic, ultra-massive news.
[02:19:38.744 --> 02:19:41.485]  All right, Bob, we held into the fourth hour to get to you.
[02:19:41.525 --> 02:19:42.526]  I appreciate you holding.
[02:19:43.046 --> 02:19:45.267]  Bob, in my home state of Texas, you're on the air.
[02:19:46.447 --> 02:19:46.667]  Yeah.
[02:19:47.047 --> 02:19:48.048]  Can you hear me?
[02:19:49.088 --> 02:19:49.928]  I can hear you.
[02:19:49.968 --> 02:19:50.649]  Talk right in the phone.
[02:19:50.809 --> 02:19:51.589]  I am.
[02:19:52.129 --> 02:19:53.050]  I'm sorry.
[02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:54.410]  I shouldn't have said that.
[02:19:55.150 --> 02:19:57.291]  I've just been waiting to talk to you for so long.
[02:20:00.268 --> 02:20:04.392]  Everything that I've been learning from you.
[02:20:05.052 --> 02:20:11.678]  You and Roger Stone, I think, really, really should work on President Trump.
[02:20:12.118 --> 02:20:18.804]  And I call him President Trump because he's still the legitimate president, as far as I'm concerned.
[02:20:20.125 --> 02:20:26.810]  You need to talk to him to try to get him to dump the idea of the shot.
[02:20:30.410 --> 02:20:32.671]  Get him to get rid of that.
[02:20:32.691 --> 02:20:37.653]  I really, really think that he's got it.
[02:20:37.873 --> 02:20:42.575]  I mean, I'll vote for him because he's already helped our country.
[02:20:42.595 --> 02:20:46.136]  He has done more than anybody.
[02:20:48.214 --> 02:20:49.434]  The last 50 years.
[02:20:49.594 --> 02:20:49.734]  I'm 69.
[02:20:50.895 --> 02:20:51.275]  Exactly.
[02:20:51.295 --> 02:20:55.275]  You can't, because I was already really mad at Trump, but you can't discount the Roe v. Wade victory.
[02:20:55.696 --> 02:20:58.116]  You can't discount the border, the China deal.
[02:20:58.576 --> 02:21:00.637]  I mean, Trump did so much good.
[02:21:00.657 --> 02:21:03.617]  That's why it's so painful that he's wrong about the poison shot.
[02:21:03.637 --> 02:21:04.677]  You're absolutely right, Bob.
[02:21:04.958 --> 02:21:05.858]  What else would you like to add?
[02:21:07.658 --> 02:21:09.679]  Just keep doing what you're doing.
[02:21:09.699 --> 02:21:13.639]  This is the first time I've ever been able to get through to you.
[02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:21.816]   Unfortunately, I've only I discovered you about five, six years ago.
[02:21:22.237 --> 02:21:25.100]  I discovered you on Facebook when you were still on there.
[02:21:25.901 --> 02:21:31.549]  And I have been faithful and I believe almost everything you say.
[02:21:32.597 --> 02:21:34.719]  Well, don't believe it, just check it out for yourself.
[02:21:34.859 --> 02:21:38.642]  Sometimes I'm wrong, but I love you, and I'm glad you got on board, Bob.
[02:21:38.722 --> 02:21:39.082]  Thank you.
[02:21:39.422 --> 02:21:41.904]  And tell others, hey, hear the hidden show.
[02:21:42.385 --> 02:21:46.748]  Hear what you're not supposed to hear at InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[02:21:46.768 --> 02:21:47.469]  We love you, Bob.
[02:21:48.850 --> 02:21:54.334]  Separately, we've got a big sale going on right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:21:54.414 --> 02:22:03.100]   It's the July 4th blowout sale, even though I'm not going to get more of these products in for a long time, I got to sell them at 40 to 75% off.
[02:22:03.220 --> 02:22:08.487]  Some were selling it below what they cost us because we got to move money in here to move into the future.

[02:22:55.478 --> 02:23:00.482]  Like 2,000 mules by Dinesh D'Souza that everybody should have on DVD in their library so it can't be censored as easily.
[02:23:00.962 --> 02:23:03.425]  All right, Kate Dowley, syndicated talk show host and great patron.
[02:23:03.745 --> 02:23:05.987]  Takes over for the next 49 minutes.
[02:23:06.007 --> 02:23:06.928]  Really appreciate her.
[02:23:07.228 --> 02:23:09.290]  Kate Dowley and then Owen Schroer, 3 p.m.
[02:23:09.310 --> 02:23:09.570]  Central.
[02:23:10.886 --> 02:23:11.647]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[02:23:11.687 --> 02:23:12.468]  I really appreciate it.
[02:23:12.668 --> 02:23:14.729]  Oh, I have so much today to get to, too.
[02:23:15.470 --> 02:23:16.391]  Let me just say this.
[02:23:16.411 --> 02:23:24.517]  We're going to go over a lot of things that can help right now that you can actually do to stop this great reset and to implement the People's Reset, right?
[02:23:25.038 --> 02:23:32.144]  But before I get there, I just want to mention a few things because, oh my gosh, I feel like all I've been doing is kind of clearing up misnomers.
[02:23:32.844 --> 02:23:36.607]  The Roe vs. Wade, it was a bad opinion that lasted for 49 years.
[02:23:36.788 --> 02:23:37.648]  The court corrected it.
[02:23:38.209 --> 02:23:38.429]  That's it.
[02:23:39.446 --> 02:23:44.288]  The actual Americans would be glad, you would think, that the court corrected themselves.
[02:23:45.048 --> 02:23:47.409]  But no, no, not when there's a vested interest to murder.
[02:23:47.829 --> 02:23:53.170]  So here is the sleight of hand, though, and I think this is what people aren't understanding about the Roe vs. Wade.
[02:23:53.190 --> 02:23:57.972]  This is so important because we can take action, and we could take action for 49 years.
[02:23:58.452 --> 02:23:59.212]  That's the lie.
[02:23:59.793 --> 02:24:07.275]  For 49 years, we could have done all kinds of things on the right to stop abortion within the states, but we didn't do it.
[02:24:08.121 --> 02:24:08.862]  For 49 years.
[02:24:09.002 --> 02:24:15.147]  And the reason I say this, and you can really look at this and understand why I'm saying this, why do you think we got the heartbeat bill?
[02:24:15.587 --> 02:24:17.388]  Why do you think states started pushing?
[02:24:17.469 --> 02:24:23.173]  And I have been interviewing states for five years on the changes they've been making to go up against Roe versus Wade.
[02:24:23.493 --> 02:24:23.733]  Why?
[02:24:24.534 --> 02:24:28.137]  Because the states finally figured out, my gosh, we had the power all along.
[02:24:29.178 --> 02:24:30.679]  It was a lie, this whole ruling.
[02:24:31.368 --> 02:24:32.349]  There was never a ruling.
[02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:34.110]  There was never anything federal.
[02:24:34.670 --> 02:24:36.792]  The Supreme Court aren't a bunch of emperors.
[02:24:36.852 --> 02:24:38.133]  They can't put out an edict.
[02:24:38.713 --> 02:24:39.614]  They can't make law.
[02:24:40.094 --> 02:24:40.735]  They never could.
[02:24:41.295 --> 02:24:43.297]  They could only give you an opinion on a Texas case.
[02:24:44.437 --> 02:24:49.341]  And then what they did in the media and in government is to tell you that it could never be touched.
[02:24:49.981 --> 02:24:50.502]  It's not true.
[02:24:51.132 --> 02:25:03.562]  The state started figuring this out, and so what the court did was expose the fact that the 49 years worth of stalling, actually this could have happened 49 years ago, but it hasn't.
[02:25:03.922 --> 02:25:17.033]  So right now is a great time to urge your right, okay, the right, I'm on the right too, on the right to go in and make resolutions on their constitutions for banning abortion.
[02:25:17.839 --> 02:25:19.920]  Because the trigger laws aren't going to do it completely.
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:23.062]  We need to absolutely do resolutions here.
[02:25:23.862 --> 02:25:27.444]  And implement that into our constitution, state constitutions.
[02:25:27.844 --> 02:25:32.526]  So for the last 49 years, as the right have been running on pro-life, right?
[02:25:32.566 --> 02:25:35.027]  They convince you they're pro-life, and then they go, and maybe they are.
[02:25:35.467 --> 02:25:37.488]  And then they say, oh, my hands are tied.
[02:25:37.808 --> 02:25:38.849]  The hands were never tied.
[02:25:39.589 --> 02:25:42.150]  Whether it's naive, whether it's ignorance, who knows?
[02:25:42.251 --> 02:25:43.071]  Whether it's intentional.
[02:25:44.040 --> 02:25:50.045]  For 49 years, the media has reported SCOTUS ruling on Roe vs. Wade as a ruling.
[02:25:50.426 --> 02:25:51.507]  It is not a ruling.
[02:25:51.767 --> 02:25:52.387]  It is an opinion.
[02:25:52.888 --> 02:25:54.409]  And for 49 years all along.
[02:25:54.449 --> 02:26:02.556]  And you should be very angry at that because we have been lied to for 49 years in telling us that we couldn't do a darn thing about it.
[02:26:03.574 --> 02:26:04.896]  Oh, it just makes me so upset.
[02:26:04.956 --> 02:26:08.019]  It was also a sleight of hand so that you would not look at the gun bill.
[02:26:08.320 --> 02:26:14.006]  Because really and truly, it was a win that Roe vs. Wade was overturned in the court.
[02:26:14.607 --> 02:26:15.668]  That's a win.
[02:26:16.707 --> 02:26:19.268]  And it exposed the states, that's another win.
[02:26:19.928 --> 02:26:22.270]  So now we have to take it the extra mile now.
[02:26:22.810 --> 02:26:26.752]  And also you should be angry that you relied to for 49 years as well.
[02:26:26.772 --> 02:26:28.452]  The states always had the power.
[02:26:29.013 --> 02:26:33.655]  So the other side of hand was not looking at the gun bill, the red flag bill.
[02:26:34.375 --> 02:26:36.176]  This bill is a liberty taker.
[02:26:36.516 --> 02:26:40.718]  This bill is gonna do the damage because the mental health umbrella is so big on this.
[02:26:41.478 --> 02:26:43.319]  And because it's the universal snitch law.
[02:26:44.557 --> 02:26:46.380]  But I'll come right back and talk about that too.
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:55.252]  I also want to say on the Roe vs Wade, never in any of my healthcare visits with any of my three kids or in my life did I ever have to talk about murder.
[02:26:55.512 --> 02:26:56.354]  It is not healthcare.
[02:26:57.195 --> 02:26:58.617]  I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:59.207 --> 02:27:00.668]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:00.708 --> 02:27:01.549]  So happy to be here.
[02:27:01.609 --> 02:27:02.409]  Thanks again, Alex.
[02:27:02.569 --> 02:27:06.212]  I'm Kate Dally, your host from The Kate Dally Show, katedallyradio.com.
[02:27:06.712 --> 02:27:12.096]  You know, I said as we were going to break, I never in any of my health care visits did I ever have to discuss the murder of a baby.
[02:27:12.556 --> 02:27:15.838]  It really is a tragedy that they're calling it health care.
[02:27:16.139 --> 02:27:16.479]  Truly.
[02:27:17.620 --> 02:27:18.700]  And you know, I'm not young.
[02:27:19.481 --> 02:27:21.242]  So give me a break, right?
[02:27:22.123 --> 02:27:25.445]  And if women are so desperate to get rid of their babies, just get the COVID shots.
[02:27:26.085 --> 02:27:26.466]  It'll do it.
[02:27:27.446 --> 02:27:28.347]  All those miscarriages.
[02:27:29.403 --> 02:27:30.263]  Over 200 of them?
[02:27:31.004 --> 02:27:32.044]  Right.
[02:27:32.165 --> 02:27:32.885]  In the test?
[02:27:33.125 --> 02:27:33.345]  Yes.
[02:27:34.226 --> 02:27:36.347]  So, why is America a she?
[02:27:36.407 --> 02:27:38.788]  And I just wanted to explain this quick history lesson for you.
[02:27:39.589 --> 02:27:42.830]  If you didn't realize this before, we always refer to this country as a she.
[02:27:43.571 --> 02:27:51.615]  And maybe this is a good lesson for all those liberal progressive, you know, pink hat wearing, kombu bat wearing, you know, monsters.
[02:27:52.876 --> 02:27:58.719]  Is that the feminine reference in Latin, because the earth was actually seen as a rich source of food and nurture.
[02:27:59.318 --> 02:28:00.580]  For all of our forebearers.
[02:28:01.060 --> 02:28:05.286]  So we refer to the planet as Mother Earth, just like we do America as a she.
[02:28:05.826 --> 02:28:06.507]  Isn't that interesting?
[02:28:06.908 --> 02:28:13.396]  Because, my gosh, it's all about the giving and the nurturing and the source, right?
[02:28:13.836 --> 02:28:14.337]  Is the mother.
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:20.185]  I'm sure women are listening to this, liberal women if there's any, that are just cringing.
[02:28:20.205 --> 02:28:21.206]  Oh, how dare they?
[02:28:21.666 --> 02:28:22.407]  Gotta call it an it.
[02:28:22.968 --> 02:28:30.735]  Anyway, a country is one's place for birth and the idea of a birth is actually directly linked to motherhood for obvious reasons.
[02:28:31.696 --> 02:28:36.140]  And it also symbolized as a female whose pride must be protected.
[02:28:36.160 --> 02:28:38.443]  There's a lot of pride in these females.
[02:28:39.188 --> 02:28:46.354]  And it's a shame because I can't imagine people running to go to go murder a baby or wanting to in the future, really thinking it out.
[02:28:46.374 --> 02:28:49.216]  I mean, that's pretty that's pretty sick, is it not?
[02:28:50.437 --> 02:28:51.418]  So nothing has changed.
[02:28:51.478 --> 02:28:53.419]  Women can still get as many abortions as they want.
[02:28:53.519 --> 02:28:56.722]  So make sure and go to resolutions in your state constitutions.
[02:28:57.062 --> 02:29:00.525]  And then you can see whether the people that ran on pro-life really meant it.
[02:29:01.337 --> 02:29:02.298]  I like that kind of test.
[02:29:02.779 --> 02:29:05.602]  The red flag, the bipartisan, of course it's bipartisan.
[02:29:05.642 --> 02:29:06.704]  It's all touchy feely.
[02:29:07.184 --> 02:29:14.553]  Over the aisle, can we sit on each other's laps and rub each other down because we're all friends and buddies and we have no morals or principles.
[02:29:15.174 --> 02:29:16.416]  That's the new meaning of bipartisan.
[02:29:16.676 --> 02:29:24.158]  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, 15 traitors, of course, and I know you've heard tons about this, but it really was a wet blanket gun victory.
[02:29:24.778 --> 02:29:28.019]  And they didn't say that permits were not bad.
[02:29:28.099 --> 02:29:29.840]  They didn't say that the law was bad.
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:32.901]  They only talked about the enforcement of that.
[02:29:33.081 --> 02:29:37.082]  And so it's a win, but it could have been a bigger win.
[02:29:37.502 --> 02:29:39.283]  And same with Roe versus Wade.
[02:29:39.603 --> 02:29:45.010]   Could have been Maybe, I don't know, admitting that they had lied, I don't know, for 49 years.
[02:29:45.030 --> 02:29:46.151]  I don't know.
[02:29:46.571 --> 02:29:51.394]  I just know that we need to seek out bigger wins than what we've been given.
[02:29:51.494 --> 02:29:58.338]  We cannot be complacent and just go along and say we've won because then people stop fighting and they think it's gone away.
[02:29:58.858 --> 02:30:00.659]  And people were saying abortion is over.
[02:30:00.679 --> 02:30:01.220]  No, it's not.
[02:30:01.480 --> 02:30:03.401]  It's alive and well in America right now.
[02:30:03.641 --> 02:30:05.102]  And a lot of people are wanting to do it.
[02:30:05.729 --> 02:30:12.412]  And so, Sergeant of Arms is dead after testifying that professional agitators were there on January 6th.
[02:30:13.432 --> 02:30:15.033]  He died of the whistleblowing disease.
[02:30:16.653 --> 02:30:21.395]  And Michael Stenger, rest in peace, worked as the US Sergeant of Arms, right?
[02:30:22.055 --> 02:30:27.297]  And of course, all the news, I just wanted to point out, they're all saying he just died, just died, natural causes, don't look here.
[02:30:27.938 --> 02:30:28.958]  Never mind, right?
[02:30:30.493 --> 02:30:42.443]  Okay, I also wanted to mention that Senator Mitch McConnell, that goofy guy, was the majority leader at the time, requested Stenger's resignation the day after this happened.
[02:30:42.683 --> 02:30:43.404]  Kind of interesting.
[02:30:44.904 --> 02:30:47.647]  I just love his testimony though, and it lives on.
[02:30:48.147 --> 02:30:51.832]  Also at January 6th, I have to throw something to Todd Starnes.
[02:30:52.192 --> 02:31:04.186]  Coming up on the season finale of J6 the movie, Cassidy's friend Sally testified she heard from her cousin Luann that her mother, Clarice, overheard that her hairdresser tell her boyfriend that a mall cop intercepted.
[02:31:06.019 --> 02:31:08.601]  I just love that, because that's exactly what it's turned into.
[02:31:08.641 --> 02:31:12.945]  The whole country's seeing it, and it's absolutely asinine, the entire thing.
[02:31:13.546 --> 02:31:14.587]  Where are all the injuries?
[02:31:14.787 --> 02:31:18.310]  Where are all the footage of people actually getting assaulted?
[02:31:18.370 --> 02:31:20.132]  I mean, it's absolutely a lie.
[02:31:21.193 --> 02:31:30.877]   I also wanted to talk, too, about the The 18 things I have in order to help what we can do.
[02:31:31.997 --> 02:31:39.500]  Not to mention, by the way, 58 babies who received COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are suffering life-threatening injuries right now.
[02:31:40.080 --> 02:31:41.040]  Stop taking the shot.
[02:31:41.120 --> 02:31:42.761]  It's evil to give this to your children.
[02:31:44.358 --> 02:31:54.264]  What we need to do, and I've talked a lot about these types of things on the radio, and as more and more come out, I think you're gonna find some of these really, really enlightening.
[02:31:54.705 --> 02:32:07.112]  Number one, Lieutenant Mark Bashaw, May of 2022, went and had to have a court-martial, right, for refusing to take the injections whatsoever, okay?
[02:32:07.788 --> 02:32:18.436]  My friend Robin Openshaw told me about this, and she was really looking into this story, and the trial convicted him, okay, for not obeying orders, but with zero penalties whatsoever.
[02:32:19.938 --> 02:32:21.359]  So really, it has no teeth.
[02:32:22.059 --> 02:32:28.705]  In fact, I know somebody that didn't take the shot, and they were sent to the Pentagon, and then given promotion after promotion.
[02:32:29.605 --> 02:32:30.486]  There's no teeth.
[02:32:31.066 --> 02:32:31.887]  They're playing chicken.
[02:32:32.528 --> 02:32:33.248]  So play chicken.
[02:32:34.189 --> 02:32:34.509]  Do it.
[02:32:35.290 --> 02:32:36.791]  You probably will win.
[02:32:37.754 --> 02:32:39.175]  And so that is the big lesson.
[02:32:39.316 --> 02:32:41.498]  The conviction was a toothless paper tiger.
[02:32:41.638 --> 02:32:42.659]  It didn't do anything.
[02:32:43.299 --> 02:32:47.663]  We cannot play this game with them and do what they say.
[02:32:47.804 --> 02:32:49.465]  We have to stand up for what's right.
[02:32:49.866 --> 02:32:50.466]  And you know what?
[02:32:50.626 --> 02:32:54.410]  Sometimes really with the cost, you know, we think the cost is going to be your job.
[02:32:54.730 --> 02:32:55.351]  Maybe not.
[02:32:56.031 --> 02:32:56.572]  Maybe not.
[02:32:57.213 --> 02:33:02.526]   So in this case, absolutely Go with your gut and stand up.
[02:33:02.626 --> 02:33:11.810]  And this was a wonderful person in the army and has done an amazing job and he had this amazing legacy.
[02:33:12.170 --> 02:33:15.472]  People loved him and he stood up and nothing happened.
[02:33:16.092 --> 02:33:19.774]  So I just wanted people to know that you can stand up.
[02:33:20.394 --> 02:33:22.217]  I also want to bring up this too.
[02:33:22.377 --> 02:33:31.890]  You know when the cows all died, well not all, but in Kansas when we had 10,000 cow deaths that were very mysteriously weird, because I can see three or four thousand, 10,000, wow that's a lot.
[02:33:33.359 --> 02:33:37.021]  You know, I brought up the fact that farmers should start to co-op.
[02:33:37.441 --> 02:33:52.587]  We should start taking money out of the stock market and putting it into farmers, investing in farming, so that not only do we have a stake in our own food later on when we really, really need it, but also the fact that these farmers are dying out and they are an awesome breed.
[02:33:52.987 --> 02:33:54.888]  I love the farmers and ranchers of America.
[02:33:54.928 --> 02:33:57.290]  I always call them the salt of the earth because they truly are.
[02:33:57.750 --> 02:33:59.311]  They are the backbone of America.
[02:33:59.451 --> 02:34:04.094]  They are what America was built on because we used to be 95% farming and ranching.
[02:34:04.575 --> 02:34:12.560]  So the ones that are left are really struggling and having a really tough time buying $120,000 tractors, and of course the cost of fuel and everything else.
[02:34:13.020 --> 02:34:15.121]  And when they lose a crop, it's pretty devastating.
[02:34:15.702 --> 02:34:20.205]  We cannot afford as a country to let them die, to let them go.
[02:34:20.725 --> 02:34:22.186]  We have to maintain them.
[02:34:22.995 --> 02:34:28.958]  Or we only are going to be solely looking at Gates's land and the government land for our food sources.
[02:34:29.399 --> 02:34:38.123]  And the fact that they just gene edited in March cows for shorter hair to, they crispered up some cows with shorter hair to resist the heat.
[02:34:38.604 --> 02:34:43.006]  I am telling you, if we don't do something for these farmers and do it quick, we're going to lose them.
[02:34:43.672 --> 02:34:45.312]  Because they are teetering right now.
[02:34:45.852 --> 02:35:02.056]  And if we could co-op them, if we could go in on the cost for cows, if we could go in on the cost for tractors, the cost for fuel, if we could take our money out of the Wall Street that we know is going to crash and put it into our future food for our future family, now that's called a return.
[02:35:02.676 --> 02:35:04.596]  Because you're going to get food out of that.
[02:35:05.316 --> 02:35:07.597]  And the farmers retain ownership.
[02:35:07.997 --> 02:35:09.157]  They still own their farm.
[02:35:09.777 --> 02:35:10.998]  Just be an investor.
[02:35:11.258 --> 02:35:12.678]  Just be somebody that helps out.
[02:35:13.334 --> 02:35:20.539]  We have to come up with some solutions right now and we're all standing around watching our country burn and watching these farmers go out of existence.
[02:35:20.639 --> 02:35:22.340]  And once they're out, they're out for good.
[02:35:22.640 --> 02:35:23.641]  They do not come back.
[02:35:24.421 --> 02:35:27.923]  And so these lands have been in their families for years and years and years.
[02:35:28.564 --> 02:35:31.946]  Do not let them, do not let their business die.
[02:35:32.586 --> 02:35:37.610]  Please, we have got to save our own food supply and we have to shore up the backbone of America.
[02:35:37.990 --> 02:35:40.972]  I'm Kay Dally, I'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:42.014 --> 02:35:43.354]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:43.394 --> 02:35:46.155]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host from The Kate Dally Show.
[02:35:46.575 --> 02:35:50.536]  And let me just tell you, get those supplements and get yourself some food storage right now.
[02:35:50.756 --> 02:35:51.536]  Alex is right.
[02:35:51.636 --> 02:35:53.017]  You need to stock up right now.
[02:35:53.097 --> 02:36:00.598]  They'll keep on the shelf all those supplements to just make sure that you're getting them and make sure you have them because as we look at shortages, it might be harder and harder to get them.
[02:36:00.819 --> 02:36:06.720]  We have a pretty short window to basically get things and right now I would say is the perfect time.
[02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:11.862]  To absolutely know that you are shored up in health and food and everything.
[02:36:12.522 --> 02:36:19.704]  So I was talking about farmers and how we could help farmers because we're just honestly standing around watching our country burn.
[02:36:20.024 --> 02:36:21.725]  There are things we can do to take action.
[02:36:21.745 --> 02:36:24.766]  And I'm just going to tell you a whole bunch of things that you could do.
[02:36:24.826 --> 02:36:28.987]  I'm really into practical answers, been thinking a lot about these things, things we can do.
[02:36:29.347 --> 02:36:43.837]   But number one, with that sleight of hand, the reason they wanted to dazzle everybody with the Roe versus Wade When even though really they were just exposing that you could have all along for 49 years done what we're about to do with our states, but we need to go farther.
[02:36:44.497 --> 02:36:46.219]  They did not want you to see the red flag.
[02:36:46.977 --> 02:36:49.078]  Bill, the bipartisan bill.
[02:36:49.678 --> 02:36:52.038]  And that bill is the snitch bill.
[02:36:52.198 --> 02:37:07.223]  Any ex-employee, any political group that doesn't like somebody on the radio, doesn't like somebody on TV saying things, can actually just make a phone call, or the police can just make it up, and go in and they can come take your guns without a trial, without due process.
[02:37:07.703 --> 02:37:08.723]  And that is so harmful.
[02:37:08.783 --> 02:37:12.104]  So make sure that, and you can see where that's gonna go, right?
[02:37:12.867 --> 02:37:14.829]  That's the way in, is to take our guns.
[02:37:15.309 --> 02:37:16.510]  They knew we'd never give them up.
[02:37:16.830 --> 02:37:17.611]  So, you know what?
[02:37:17.711 --> 02:37:21.594]  You take them and you call everybody a mental health risk.
[02:37:21.634 --> 02:37:22.455]  Remember Georgia?
[02:37:22.535 --> 02:37:31.763]  Georgia passed that law that basically changed the language to a harm to oneself, where you could be committed against your will, to a harm in the future.
[02:37:32.263 --> 02:37:37.507]  In the future, at some point in the future, you could be a harm to someone or something.
[02:37:38.728 --> 02:37:40.750]  Remember that because the other states are going to do it too.
[02:37:41.854 --> 02:37:42.754]  Then we're really in trouble.
[02:37:44.715 --> 02:37:46.376]  Because anything could be considered mental health.
[02:37:46.616 --> 02:37:56.279]  So make sure you're going in and getting a resolution to the Constitution in your state constitution against the taking of your guns by the feds.
[02:37:56.599 --> 02:38:01.261]  The taking of your guns, because there's a lot of money going to flow in to pay the states and pay them off just like COVID bucks.
[02:38:01.841 --> 02:38:05.182]  So we have to make resolutions so that you get your due process.
[02:38:05.362 --> 02:38:06.823]  They have to go through proper channels.
[02:38:07.463 --> 02:38:10.104]  The other thing is this, we're talking a lot about gas.
[02:38:10.891 --> 02:38:22.698]  Why aren't the states saying we have our own domestic oil supply within our states, and we're going to make sure our people that live in our states get the decent price?
[02:38:23.639 --> 02:38:28.321]  Why are we always saying that it's up to the feds and up to the King-Fraud-A-Lot administration?
[02:38:29.622 --> 02:38:32.504]  The states certainly can exercise some sovereignty on this.
[02:38:33.163 --> 02:38:37.427]  They certainly have oil everywhere, and they certainly can make agreements.
[02:38:37.767 --> 02:38:42.372]  If for some reason they don't, they can make an agreement with a state that's already set up for domestic oil.
[02:38:42.872 --> 02:38:48.377]  They absolutely could define what we're paying for gas right now if they wanted to.
[02:38:48.597 --> 02:38:49.858]  So where's our state sovereignty?
[02:38:49.899 --> 02:38:52.201]  Where's our governors with a backbone, right?
[02:38:52.221 --> 02:38:54.383]  It's hard to find.
[02:38:55.003 --> 02:38:55.644]  It's really sad.
[02:38:56.825 --> 02:39:00.294]   My own is super feminine and Totally weird.
[02:39:00.794 --> 02:39:02.235]  But, I'm stuck with them, right?
[02:39:02.295 --> 02:39:03.156]  We're stuck with these guys.
[02:39:03.336 --> 02:39:07.619]  And so, a lot of heat and a lot of pressure that we need to put on these guys.
[02:39:07.719 --> 02:39:10.241]  But they absolutely could control that if they wanted to.
[02:39:10.601 --> 02:39:13.083]  Same with Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota.
[02:39:13.344 --> 02:39:14.965]  All three of those states are Republican.
[02:39:15.105 --> 02:39:17.727]  Why are they not passing their section of the pipeline?
[02:39:18.788 --> 02:39:20.969]  Why is there no heat on these states to do this?
[02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:23.511]  They absolutely could do that.
[02:39:24.252 --> 02:39:28.015]  Why are we always putting the ball in King Fratellotti's court?
[02:39:28.655 --> 02:39:29.516]  There's no reason for it.
[02:39:32.153 --> 02:39:36.855]  Also, your county commissioners in your county could say, hey, don't pay for gas.
[02:39:36.935 --> 02:39:38.635]  I'm sorry, tax on gas.
[02:39:39.035 --> 02:39:40.536]  Don't pay for registration fees.
[02:39:40.976 --> 02:39:45.757]  There's a lot of fees and a lot of nonsense that I think is unconstitutional anyway.
[02:39:46.118 --> 02:39:51.899]  But they could absolutely step up and say, don't pay those things until this is over, right?
[02:39:52.480 --> 02:39:57.601]  So that they can urge it along to get to kind of come to a head so we can get some lower prices.
[02:39:58.121 --> 02:39:59.222]  But why not do that?
[02:40:00.609 --> 02:40:02.630]  A county could stand apart from the state.
[02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:03.751]  They've done it before.
[02:40:04.451 --> 02:40:05.292]  Why can't they do it now?
[02:40:06.072 --> 02:40:07.453]  They absolutely can do it.
[02:40:08.593 --> 02:40:12.676]  And so you can put heat on your local county commissioners because you have that ability.
[02:40:12.756 --> 02:40:13.776]  Same with election fraud.
[02:40:14.156 --> 02:40:20.040]  The county commissioners in the country are the ones that can absolutely go to bat and change the system for how you vote.
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:23.261]  So have you put any pressure on them at all to do that?
[02:40:24.362 --> 02:40:28.964]  I call ours locally Manny Moe and Jack because they're so idiotic.
[02:40:29.305 --> 02:40:29.965]  They won't do a thing.
[02:40:30.755 --> 02:40:32.976]  And we have to keep pushing and pushing and pushing.
[02:40:33.116 --> 02:40:34.416]  Show up at those county meetings.
[02:40:35.097 --> 02:40:48.381]  Show up and say, I want you to change all this election fraud that's going on, and I don't want mail-in voting because it causes fraud, and I want to be in person, and you should be demanding it in these counties.
[02:40:49.656 --> 02:40:56.258]  Also, support movies that do not support the woke agenda by looking to see what the movies have in them, like Buzz Lightyear.
[02:40:57.018 --> 02:40:58.899]  I'm so glad that flopped, it totally deserved it.
[02:40:59.099 --> 02:41:05.081]  Disney's gone, totally jumped the shark, and it's sickening what they're doing to a little Mickey Mouse, isn't it?
[02:41:06.001 --> 02:41:06.861]  The little woke agenda.
[02:41:07.321 --> 02:41:12.383]  Also, what we can be doing on the right is making a hell of a lot more movies, like 2000 Mules.
[02:41:12.763 --> 02:41:16.964]  Put your money there, in the awakening of people to understand what's really going on.
[02:41:17.544 --> 02:41:19.286]  These people always need your support.
[02:41:19.726 --> 02:41:26.552]  And movies like Top Gun, if you really want to go see a Holly weird movie, go see something like Top Gun that doesn't have any woke agenda in it.
[02:41:26.953 --> 02:41:29.495]  The only message there is, I'm old but I still matter.
[02:41:30.756 --> 02:41:32.218]  So go see those.
[02:41:32.298 --> 02:41:34.400]  I mean, people flocked to that movie for a reason.
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:37.923]  They wanted nothing with politics in it.
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:40.221]  Oh man, what a lesson.
[02:41:40.442 --> 02:41:41.022]  What a lesson.
[02:41:41.082 --> 02:41:42.263]  They won't learn from that lesson.
[02:41:42.363 --> 02:41:44.525]  Every all-women cast movie will fail.
[02:41:44.886 --> 02:41:46.227]  Every woke agenda will fail.
[02:41:46.787 --> 02:41:54.254]  And now we have, I can't remember her name, the little itty-bitty star from Star Wars, is trying to bulk up to be Thor, right?
[02:41:54.475 --> 02:41:56.376]  A woman Thor, and she's like five foot one.
[02:41:56.877 --> 02:41:59.059]  I'm sorry, how much can you seriously bulk up?
[02:41:59.319 --> 02:42:01.541]  And if you have to bulk up, aren't you trying to be more manly?
[02:42:02.702 --> 02:42:03.483]  So ridiculous.
[02:42:04.019 --> 02:42:05.080]  Anyway, it's asinine.
[02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:06.760]  Also, here's another one.
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:08.761]  My friend bought a truth truck.
[02:42:09.141 --> 02:42:09.702]  A truth truck.
[02:42:09.982 --> 02:42:12.283]  This is a truck with solar panels and messages.
[02:42:12.723 --> 02:42:17.586]  And so she delivers messages about the vaccines, messages about all kinds of things.
[02:42:18.526 --> 02:42:23.048]  And she drives that truck around and parks it in certain areas so people can get these messages.
[02:42:23.388 --> 02:42:24.689]  It's like a moving billboard.
[02:42:25.305 --> 02:42:29.347]  Why aren't more people doing this?
[02:42:29.447 --> 02:42:32.248]  Why aren't we owning billboards?
[02:42:32.468 --> 02:42:39.610]  Why are we not putting out truth messages to counteract the lying scumbags and whorebags in media?
[02:42:39.710 --> 02:42:40.991]  Why are we not doing this?
[02:42:41.831 --> 02:42:44.092]  We have so many things in our arsenal, but we don't do them.
[02:42:44.672 --> 02:42:45.172]  We don't do them.
[02:42:45.192 --> 02:42:47.573]  We sit and watch our country burn, and then we complain.
[02:42:47.953 --> 02:42:49.254]  There's no room for complaining.
[02:42:50.283 --> 02:42:51.643]  Um, and so truth trucks.
[02:42:52.084 --> 02:42:54.744]  Everybody, every city in America should have a truth truck.
[02:42:55.124 --> 02:42:55.764]  Go in on it.
[02:42:55.824 --> 02:42:56.885]  Get a group to go in on it.
[02:42:56.985 --> 02:42:57.765]  Raise money for it.
[02:42:57.825 --> 02:42:58.685]  Whatever you have to do.
[02:42:58.705 --> 02:42:59.725]  Want to do a car wash?
[02:42:59.905 --> 02:43:00.286]  Great!
[02:43:00.826 --> 02:43:01.606]  Let's fund those.
[02:43:02.086 --> 02:43:10.468]  Because if people don't hear these messages, like the fact that we didn't have, you know, one new cemetery in the year 2020, so what did they do with 500,000 bodies?
[02:43:11.068 --> 02:43:14.489]  I mean, satellite would have picked up big burnings, so I'm pretty sure they didn't do that.
[02:43:15.109 --> 02:43:18.070]  Anyway, we need to do something about getting the truth out, okay?
[02:43:18.695 --> 02:43:22.078]  And then also homesteading, lowering property tax, right?
[02:43:22.738 --> 02:43:26.281]  Following the procedures, print out a declaration of homesteading.
[02:43:27.002 --> 02:43:27.742]  It's a huge one.
[02:43:28.102 --> 02:43:29.704]  Here's another one for land too.
[02:43:30.004 --> 02:43:30.704]  So vital.
[02:43:30.785 --> 02:43:34.347]  I hope everybody in America is going to really listen to this right now.
[02:43:34.848 --> 02:43:37.630]  You bought a home and all you got was a warranty deed.
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:40.761]  A warranty deed doesn't do anything.
[02:43:40.961 --> 02:43:43.901]  The mortgage company thought they could get away with giving you a warranty deed.
[02:43:44.221 --> 02:43:46.742]  What you really need is a land patent.
[02:43:47.242 --> 02:43:50.523]  Because the government owns what's under your ground, not you.
[02:43:51.663 --> 02:43:52.043]  They do.
[02:43:52.623 --> 02:43:58.485]  If you have a land patent, and it's a matter of paperwork, and it's a matter of going in and doing the paperwork.
[02:43:58.545 --> 02:44:02.846]  Ron Gibson, my friend, Manny's been doing this for 40 years and teaching all about it all over America.
[02:44:03.872 --> 02:44:07.733]  If you go in for the land patent, you own everything under that land.
[02:44:07.853 --> 02:44:12.714]  Much harder to take your home from you when they collapse our economy and want to do so.
[02:44:13.074 --> 02:44:14.034]  A land patent.
[02:44:14.174 --> 02:44:15.454]  All you have is a warranty deed.
[02:44:15.754 --> 02:44:17.514]  You need a land patent.
[02:44:17.955 --> 02:44:25.696]  That is so vital, I can't even tell you, because all of us were taught to think that a warranty deed was all we needed, and it's not.
[02:44:26.056 --> 02:44:28.636]  You must get a land patent, okay?
[02:44:29.117 --> 02:44:31.597]  If you really want to own your home so that they can't take it.
[02:44:32.395 --> 02:44:40.137]  Homesteading is just another option and go look up homesteading and what you do is you follow the procedures to print out a declaration of homesteading.
[02:44:40.617 --> 02:44:49.319]  Really, really important to do some of these things and look into them because if we don't, we're just sitting here waiting for the collapse.
[02:44:49.540 --> 02:44:50.980]  I mean, come on, can't we do more?
[02:44:51.900 --> 02:44:55.262]  We have to get prepared for a people's reset.
[02:44:55.582 --> 02:44:59.004]  We have to be the ones that say no to their Great Reset.
[02:44:59.064 --> 02:45:05.107]  Why aren't companies developing lines of loans and funding for those that do not accept the Woke Agenda?
[02:45:05.368 --> 02:45:09.490]  Because the Woke Agenda companies are the only ones that are going to be funded in the future in the Great Reset.
[02:45:09.730 --> 02:45:10.511]  That's what it's all about.
[02:45:10.851 --> 02:45:19.976]  That's why they're going to bat for the glitter and the sparkle and the, you know, everything's gay in June is because they're proving their wokeness so they can get future money.
[02:45:20.516 --> 02:45:21.497]  I'll be right back.
[02:45:21.757 --> 02:45:26.781]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host for the Alex Jones Show, but I'll be right back and I have so many more to tell you about.
[02:45:27.281 --> 02:45:28.782]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:45:28.802 --> 02:45:30.183]  I'm so glad to be here with you.
[02:45:30.203 --> 02:45:48.409]   I'm Kate Dally from the Kate Dally Show, your guest host, and I always appreciate coming in each week to share with you some of the things I've learned, I've been studying, and really wanted to bring some solutions to you today because I felt like We're standing around, we don't know what to do, we feel like we can't do anything as one person.
[02:45:48.669 --> 02:45:51.031]  You'd be so surprised what you can do as one person.
[02:45:51.071 --> 02:46:01.518]  It reminds me of the old video where the guy is dancing, and he's dancing in a crowd, and the whole crowd is looking at him like he has two heads, and then all of a sudden, another person joins him.
[02:46:02.509 --> 02:46:07.213]  And then all of a sudden the people start not looking at him like he has two heads, but hmm, another person joined him.
[02:46:07.774 --> 02:46:09.995]  And then pretty soon everybody was dancing.
[02:46:10.116 --> 02:46:11.457]  And that's kind of how this works.
[02:46:11.857 --> 02:46:12.878]  We have to lead out.
[02:46:13.038 --> 02:46:14.299]  We've got to be lions right now.
[02:46:14.339 --> 02:46:19.824]  We cannot be little mice that just sit in the corner and are fretting and are worried.
[02:46:19.884 --> 02:46:20.805]  And I know that's not you.
[02:46:20.845 --> 02:46:23.627]  I absolutely love this audience because I know that's not you.
[02:46:23.907 --> 02:46:27.010]  You want to do things to help this country because you love this country.
[02:46:27.270 --> 02:46:32.953]  And as we're coming up on Independence Day, and we need to call it Independence Day, not July 4th.
[02:46:33.133 --> 02:46:36.836]  We don't call Christmas December 25th and take away all of its meaning.
[02:46:37.436 --> 02:46:38.837]  Call it Independence Day.
[02:46:39.497 --> 02:46:40.978]  Because it is Independence Day.
[02:46:41.690 --> 02:46:44.692]  And, you know, are we celebrating it or memorializing it?
[02:46:44.753 --> 02:46:48.035]  You know, Conor Boyack said that to me this week, and I said, yeah, you're right.
[02:46:48.175 --> 02:46:49.817]  What are we doing, you know, as a country?
[02:46:50.377 --> 02:47:04.768]  And so I feel sad right now, and I'm going to feel sad on Independence Day, because I'm realizing what we're losing to the woke mobs and to utter stupidity and the total morons out there that have the microphone, and we have to do more on this side.
[02:47:05.028 --> 02:47:08.071]  And this is why I'm bringing all these solutions to you, because these are things we can do.
[02:47:09.449 --> 02:47:17.931]  So, no matter what happens, no matter how this story plays out, and if you read the scriptures you know how it plays out, we're still responsible for everything we do.
[02:47:18.786 --> 02:47:21.428]  So, we have to just keep doing it.
[02:47:21.729 --> 02:47:22.389]  That's the answer.
[02:47:22.870 --> 02:47:23.630]  So, here's some more.
[02:47:24.171 --> 02:47:44.147]  One of the things I always talk about is water because I live in a desert and water is such a big deal and they call it liquid gold and then the counties are always seeking to fine-tune, that's what they call it when they want to gouge you some more with more taxes for it, is fine-tune the regulations so that you're paying a hilt for this water.
[02:47:45.228 --> 02:47:49.351]  But primary water is earth-generated water and nobody ever talks about it.
[02:47:50.071 --> 02:47:52.412]  You can go to primarywater.org and find out more about it.
[02:47:52.953 --> 02:47:57.375]  But when conditions are right, the oxygen combines with hydrogen to make new water.
[02:47:57.816 --> 02:48:02.799]  This water is being pushed up under great pressure from very, very deep in the earth.
[02:48:02.839 --> 02:48:04.740]  It's very renewable and it never ends.
[02:48:05.624 --> 02:48:10.106]  And it finds its way towards the surface of the earth where there are fissures or faults.
[02:48:10.427 --> 02:48:18.090]  And depending on the geology, primary water can be close to the surface or it can be and flow out as a spring or it can be very, very, very deep.
[02:48:18.351 --> 02:48:18.631]  Okay?
[02:48:19.171 --> 02:48:20.752]  And so how can we access it?
[02:48:21.212 --> 02:48:25.115]  Well, the origins of primary water are deep because there's great pressure.
[02:48:25.155 --> 02:48:31.599]  It moves upwards wherever possible and it also confronts a blocking geologic structure.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:32.960]  It will remain deep.
[02:48:33.120 --> 02:48:47.831]  So, you go into the weak areas of the Earth's crust and it moves forward and until it's blocked or finds a way to the surface, these weaker areas are often sort of associated with mountain ranges where faults are common, but it can also be in flat areas too.
[02:48:48.630 --> 02:48:50.451]  And so these fresh water vents are there.
[02:48:50.992 --> 02:48:52.813]  How do you think we got water all along?
[02:48:52.973 --> 02:48:54.634]  It didn't just come from rainfall and snow.
[02:48:54.694 --> 02:48:56.615]  How idiotic, but that's what we're taught in school.
[02:48:57.015 --> 02:48:58.556]  That's what the weathermen say, right?
[02:48:58.837 --> 02:49:00.157]  And that's what government says.
[02:49:00.438 --> 02:49:01.838]  In fact, my own governor was saying it.
[02:49:01.858 --> 02:49:02.719]  He's such a moron.
[02:49:03.219 --> 02:49:04.680]  It only comes from snowpack.
[02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:05.541]  That's not true.
[02:49:06.281 --> 02:49:28.227]  Water comes from down deep as well and it's also pushed upward so you can get it from both angles and you have to know what you're doing to find it and it is the best water and it's also the water that could help us because I know as they try to promote human-caused global climate change they're going to probably harp us into hotter and hotter weather.
[02:49:28.668 --> 02:49:35.012]   Well if that's the case Water will be an issue if we're only going to rely on it the way we've relied on it.
[02:49:35.332 --> 02:49:38.675]  And why do you think the government always wanted so much control over it?
[02:49:39.495 --> 02:49:48.543]  The government really, the state governments, the counties, they really wanted that control so that they could continue to charge us more and more money for it.
[02:49:48.883 --> 02:49:50.304]  So there's such a game involved.
[02:49:50.644 --> 02:49:56.352]  But we need to be smart enough to be able to find these and you can go to primarywater.org and learn more.
[02:49:56.853 --> 02:50:04.704]  This is how Lake Elsinore was actually refilled was they went down deep into primary water to refill it.
[02:50:04.764 --> 02:50:07.047]  So don't let anyone tell you they cannot do that.
[02:50:07.771 --> 02:50:12.436]  Before they've even looked into it, because it's very possible and it's been going on for centuries, okay?
[02:50:13.578 --> 02:50:21.106]  Veterans, I talked about the grid system this week and we have three major grids in our country.
[02:50:21.506 --> 02:50:24.390]  We have a West Coast, we have Texas, and then we have an East Coast.
[02:50:25.090 --> 02:50:27.391]  And they're never ever secured.
[02:50:28.592 --> 02:50:30.273]  Congress won't do anything to secure them.
[02:50:30.333 --> 02:50:32.874]  The states aren't doing much to secure them.
[02:50:33.374 --> 02:50:35.055]  And so they're very, very vulnerable.
[02:50:35.435 --> 02:50:39.197]  And what's interesting is we always think cyber attack, but it's actually down on the list.
[02:50:39.618 --> 02:50:45.040]  Physical attack is really one of the higher reasons why we have problems with these stations.
[02:50:45.480 --> 02:50:53.124]  If something goes wrong in the major stations that control the country, and we also control Canada, but if something goes wrong, where do we get our parts?
[02:50:54.045 --> 02:50:54.305]  China.
[02:50:56.010 --> 02:50:56.992]  China, yeah.
[02:50:57.994 --> 02:51:06.453]  And it could take up to 18 months to get a new major part for these stations, for these grids.
[02:51:08.075 --> 02:51:13.977]  And so when you think about that, I was thinking, what could we immediately do since they're not willing to do anything?
[02:51:14.317 --> 02:51:17.618]  What about retired veterans that guard substations?
[02:51:18.078 --> 02:51:18.739]  What about that?
[02:51:18.859 --> 02:51:28.602]  Because we truly are not doing anything to secure the fact that our country would come to a standstill very, very, very quickly.
[02:51:29.082 --> 02:51:31.923]  So there are things we could do if we were willing to do them.
[02:51:32.383 --> 02:51:37.325]  And why aren't states buying transformers now instead of waiting 18 months when one breaks?
[02:51:38.504 --> 02:51:38.724]  Right?
[02:51:38.964 --> 02:51:42.187]  Just like right now, we should be buying a lot of car parts for our cars.
[02:51:42.327 --> 02:51:49.171]  Fuel pumps and tires and all those things, because those are the things that you're going to consistently need, right?
[02:51:49.932 --> 02:51:52.914]  And get them now before a shortage unveils itself.
[02:51:53.514 --> 02:51:54.235]  Makes sense to me.
[02:51:55.215 --> 02:52:02.801]  But we need to push our states to buy transformers now to buoy up all of the substations in your state too, besides even the major ones.
[02:52:03.061 --> 02:52:06.203]  But the major ones, yes, could take up to 18 months to get from China.
[02:52:07.003 --> 02:52:09.209]  And do we have any companies here that make these?
[02:52:09.870 --> 02:52:10.292]  No, we don't.
[02:52:11.956 --> 02:52:12.437]  No, we don't.
[02:52:13.359 --> 02:52:13.560]  Sad.
[02:52:15.699 --> 02:52:17.120]  So, also, here's another one.
[02:52:17.740 --> 02:52:26.425]  Doctors can step away from socialized NIH-controlled medicine, as we saw with Remdesivir and their protocol, and start their own clinics for the un-vaxxed.
[02:52:27.186 --> 02:52:36.971]  As more and more people are dying from the vaccination, it's going to be very, very clear that this is not something that you should take into your body, as it's promoting, you know, heart attacks and strokes and vertigo and everything else.
[02:52:37.451 --> 02:52:42.474]  So, let's see doctors form their own clinics, and if you want to put money into something, put it into those clinics.
[02:52:43.237 --> 02:52:48.721]  Also, if they come up with a Mommy Loves Mommy book every five minutes, come up with a book to contradict that.
[02:52:48.761 --> 02:52:50.823]  A brand new book about mommies and daddies.
[02:52:51.223 --> 02:52:53.084]  We have to be able to fight this war.
[02:52:53.625 --> 02:52:55.926]  See, they use bully groups to get into the schools.
[02:52:56.026 --> 02:52:58.328]  It's always under the guise of bullying.
[02:52:58.608 --> 02:53:03.212]  And then they go in and they're very, very pro-LGBT and transgender to the kids.
[02:53:03.552 --> 02:53:06.034]  But they always get in saying that they're against bullying.
[02:53:06.784 --> 02:53:08.284]  So why don't we use that same tactic?
[02:53:08.784 --> 02:53:17.526]  Why don't we get in under the guise of bullying and talk about the Constitution and talk about America and talk about the love for America and its founding?
[02:53:17.586 --> 02:53:18.546]  Why can't we do that?
[02:53:19.887 --> 02:53:22.887]  Also, blast the newspapers with op-eds.
[02:53:23.227 --> 02:53:24.468]  They can't keep ignoring you.
[02:53:25.068 --> 02:53:26.088]  They seem to want to ignore me.
[02:53:26.428 --> 02:53:30.469]  But blast them with op-eds so that you can get your message out.
[02:53:30.709 --> 02:53:32.469]  And keep sending op-eds.
[02:53:32.729 --> 02:53:34.170]  And that's something anyone can do.
[02:53:34.190 --> 02:53:35.210]  Write an article.
[02:53:36.242 --> 02:53:39.224]  Also, don't go to the places where feds are surely going to show up.
[02:53:40.344 --> 02:53:44.866]  As we're consistently told, I think it's the feds that are the professional agitators.
[02:53:45.226 --> 02:53:53.550]  And so don't go and certainly don't bring your phone as they're going to net the whole entire area to see who you are and to know where you are.
[02:53:54.511 --> 02:54:05.156]  And also, if you notice drills consistently going on within a school, and it seems a little odd to you that the feds keep hanging around and SWAT keeps hanging around and ICE keeps hanging around.
[02:54:06.230 --> 02:54:12.854]  Elementary school for another drill, because this has happened, start talking about it, posting it, exposing it.
[02:54:13.354 --> 02:54:14.095]  Get it on the net.
[02:54:14.475 --> 02:54:20.699]  Get that exposure on the net so people can see that yes, the feds were hanging around and hanging around and drilling there.
[02:54:20.899 --> 02:54:23.100]  There was no reason for it, right?
[02:54:23.180 --> 02:54:29.584]  And you know what I'm talking about, a particular elementary school that had dozens and dozens of drills for no apparent reason.
[02:54:29.824 --> 02:54:30.585]  And it starts with a U.
[02:54:31.689 --> 02:54:42.033]  Also, on the day you vote, wouldn't it be interesting if we grabbed Sharpies and wrote on our T-shirts, wrote on our arms who we voted for, so there was a very visual representation of who we voted for?
[02:54:42.474 --> 02:54:45.135]  So that it couldn't just be, no, we just didn't get enough votes.
[02:54:45.715 --> 02:54:53.318]  If you had pictures of who people, large groups, everyone with a T-shirt on going, I voted for, you know what I mean?
[02:54:53.678 --> 02:54:58.380]  For president or for governor, wouldn't it be interesting to see the visuals of that?
[02:54:58.700 --> 02:55:00.801]  How in the world could they conduct the fraud?
[02:55:01.301 --> 02:55:05.462]  With so many representations of who people actually voted for.
[02:55:05.482 --> 02:55:09.243]  I don't know, maybe it's time to do that since they won't fix election fraud.
[02:55:10.023 --> 02:55:10.403]  I don't know.
[02:55:11.243 --> 02:55:16.724]  But I still, I don't want to see the fraud winners win anymore, do you?
[02:55:17.264 --> 02:55:24.145]  And maybe we truly need to do something a little different than just count on the machine, which we all know is so corrupt.
[02:55:24.185 --> 02:55:26.186]  I've been talking about those machines for six years.
[02:55:26.986 --> 02:55:27.926]  They're so corrupt.
[02:55:28.607 --> 02:55:32.931]  They either multiply a vote or they divide a vote in the back of the software.
[02:55:33.271 --> 02:55:39.035]  And so if people had a visual representation of who they actually voted for, I don't know how you could fight that.
[02:55:39.296 --> 02:55:40.577]  I don't know how you could contradict that.
[02:55:41.858 --> 02:55:43.699]  Anyway, I hope these solutions helped.
[02:55:44.159 --> 02:55:50.464]  And I hope that we look at each one of those as something that we could really do right now, because we have got to save this country.
[02:55:50.504 --> 02:55:58.023]   And as we go forward to Independence Day, I'm always emotional on Independence Day anyway because we have such a wonderful country.
[02:55:58.063 --> 02:55:58.643]  Let's save it.
[02:55:58.483 --> 02:56:17.362]  it. Let's protect it.
[02:56:17.475 --> 02:56:22.157]  And we also need the funding to stay on air and not have InfoWars shut down.

[02:57:58.112 --> 02:58:02.712]   And a lot of these products really, really do that, but they do a lot more amazing things as well.
[02:58:02.712 --> 02:58:05.592]  And here's something just as important.
[02:58:05.592 --> 02:58:09.212]   We have to sell these products to have funds to operate into the future,
[02:58:09.212 --> 02:58:13.792]   even though most of these products, we only have a few thousand bottles left of,
[02:58:13.792 --> 02:58:18.653]   and we're not even sure when we're gonna get more, But I'm in that catch-22 of where we've got to move it.
[02:58:18.582 --> 02:58:20.623]  So this could be the last time you ever get these products.
[02:58:21.003 --> 02:58:23.545]  We absolutely need the funding, and they're amazing products.

[02:58:27.688 --> 02:58:37.132]   It is the July 4th Super Sale Blowout that is starting right now, and I have taken the donations, the Bitcoin donations and things and put
[02:58:37.132 --> 02:58:41.432]   orders in on eight of our best-selling products that have been sold out because of
[02:58:41.432 --> 02:58:44.271]   supply chain breakdowns and we got in a bind because the supply chain
[02:58:44.271 --> 02:58:48.632]   breakdowns didn't have funds from other products being sold so we'd have the money
[02:58:48.632 --> 02:58:52.612]   to even buy those popular products now they're actually available again
[02:58:52.612 --> 02:58:58.092]   highest quality proprietary but now we do and so in one month for the
[02:58:58.092 --> 02:59:04.222]   products come back in and in two months the other four products come in hooray hallelujah
