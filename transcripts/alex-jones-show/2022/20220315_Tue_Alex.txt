[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.590]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.930]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.030]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[00:00:04.071 --> 00:00:05.471]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[00:00:05.491 --> 00:00:06.231]  And Joe Rogan?
[00:00:06.471 --> 00:00:06.952]  Elon Musk?
[00:00:07.112 --> 00:00:08.192]  You know where they tune in, right?
[00:00:08.452 --> 00:00:11.833]  They tune in right here!
[00:00:13.074 --> 00:00:13.814]  InfoWars.
[00:00:14.194 --> 00:00:15.055]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:32.935]  today.
[00:00:33.015 --> 00:00:35.015]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:52.015]   Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live Ides of March, March 15th.
[00:00:51.884 --> 00:01:06.525]   It was more than 2000 years ago that Julius Caesar, the first emperor of Rome, was stabbed
[00:01:06.525 --> 00:01:08.125]  to death inside the Roman Senate.
[00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:18.125]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.024]  This has been seen as a very dangerous, unlucky day ever since then.
[00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:31.738]   And if you look at the continuation of the czars, which basically means the king or the Caesar in Russian, Russia particularly More than any other country in modern history, but it's a thousand-year-old civilization, kills its leaders when they fail.
[00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:43.027]  All systems do this to some extent, but the Russians are the most extreme proclivity to this, and there's a very good chance.
[00:01:43.507 --> 00:01:47.751]  That's why Lindsey Graham is out there talking about, you know, people need to kill Putin.
[00:01:48.251 --> 00:01:49.872]  He's not just saying that for no reason.
[00:01:49.912 --> 00:01:52.975]  He's encouraging Russians to kill Putin.
[00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:55.600]  Obviously, this is all spiraling out of control.
[00:01:56.081 --> 00:01:58.763]  Putin is now not just arresting his spy chiefs, but others.
[00:01:59.423 --> 00:02:04.507]  There's reports of, you know, battlefield executions of troops that don't follow orders.
[00:02:05.247 --> 00:02:08.790]  Because what you have here is NATO starting a proxy war with Russia.
[00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.173]  So Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and, you know, really George Soros.
[00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.195]  Yes, starting a war with Russia.
[00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.235]  Russia had a reason to do this.
[00:02:17.255 --> 00:02:18.396]  I'm not defending them going in.
[00:02:20.518 --> 00:02:30.111]   But then once Putin comes in, And his army's bogged down because there's basically, they're fighting Slavic peoples that are where Russia was started.
[00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:34.193]  It'd be like asking people in Texas to go kill people in Oklahoma.
[00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:39.976]  Or it'd be like asking people in New York to go kill people in New Jersey.
[00:02:40.376 --> 00:02:42.177]  They're like, well, my aunt and uncle live in New Jersey.
[00:02:42.357 --> 00:02:43.197]  What are you going to be doing?
[00:02:43.237 --> 00:02:47.840]  So Ukraine's more than 60% ethnic Russian.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.562]  The rest is more Germanic type groups in the West, but they're all intermarried.
[00:02:53.488 --> 00:02:55.790]  And I know listeners understand all this.
[00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:14.044]  It's just that having Putin tied down now and definitely he was unable to pay off enough of the Ukrainian military and the resistance like his generals and his KGB foreign head told him.
[00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:16.085]  That's what I said three weeks ago.
[00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:19.108]  I said, well, if it goes quickly, it means they've paid off the opposition.
[00:03:19.168 --> 00:03:19.849]  That's what you do.
[00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.951]  It looks like they didn't do a good job of that.
[00:03:22.632 --> 00:03:27.597]  And so now he's in a no-win situation where if he doesn't win this, he'll be killed.
[00:03:27.997 --> 00:03:34.544]  You'll hear he's had a stroke or a heart attack or a helicopter crash or a jet crash.
[00:03:35.692 --> 00:03:59.880]  Or if he does continue to push, there'll be massive civilian casualties, and that will be more and more of a pretext for NATO to publicly come in, not just with all the US and British and Scottish and German and French special forces that are on the ground, both former and current, active duty, fighting the little green men.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.274]   That's what they call the Russians, because the Russians have denied that they've been Ukraine in the last eight years.
[00:04:05.294 --> 00:04:07.356]  And of course they have been there.
[00:04:07.857 --> 00:04:08.337]  And U.S.
[00:04:08.377 --> 00:04:15.364]  troops and European troops and Russian troops have been killing each other for at least eight years in a proxy war.
[00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:16.685]  And Putin's tired of that.
[00:04:17.346 --> 00:04:19.268]  And I understand the reason he went in.
[00:04:19.995 --> 00:04:24.718]  But it is an extremely dangerous gamble, and he walked into a trap.
[00:04:24.958 --> 00:04:25.818]  And he said that now.
[00:04:26.018 --> 00:04:32.782]  They put the people on house arrest and said, they told me that they had already cleaned out the opposition, that they were going to fold.
[00:04:32.862 --> 00:04:37.325]  So now we're in a world where it isn't about being on Russia's side, or Ukraine's side, or the U.S.
[00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:38.345]  side, or the EU side.
[00:04:38.786 --> 00:04:40.086]  It's about being on the side of survival.
[00:04:40.126 --> 00:04:50.163]   And we have the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Gutierrez, We'll play this clip when we come back next segment, saying we're on the verge of nuclear war, and we are.
[00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:56.044]  And I've talked to some of the top minds out there just in the last 24 hours, face to face.
[00:04:56.724 --> 00:05:00.565]  I'm not going to get any names or anything, but that's why I'm here in Los Angeles.
[00:05:01.465 --> 00:05:05.846]  And I've got a real consensus from some of the top brains on the planet.
[00:05:06.046 --> 00:05:11.192]   Again, that'll all be off record, but it's The different scenarios run from bad to worse.
[00:05:11.572 --> 00:05:14.114]  We'll be laying it all out here today, InfoWars.com.
[00:05:14.434 --> 00:05:16.715]  Tomorrow's news today, Owen Schwartz will be riding shotgun.
[00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:26.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live March 15th, 2022 global transmission.
[00:05:27.761 --> 00:05:32.724]  I have not ducked out of Austin the last few days for a vacation.
[00:05:33.724 --> 00:05:36.726]  I am here in Los Angeles, California.
[00:05:38.147 --> 00:05:57.694]  Talking to quite a few very interesting and important folks, and I've had a chance to talk to who I consider some of the sharpest minds in the world in the last 24 hours in really lengthy summit meetings, I would call it, to try to brainstorm how to avert the situation in Russia.
[00:05:57.714 --> 00:06:05.537]  This has got a lot of serious people strongly considering decamping and evacuating to the southern hemisphere.
[00:06:06.798 --> 00:06:08.987]   So A lot of people have already done that.
[00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:15.717]  So when I tell you that some of the most powerful people in the world have been doing that, that is not something I read in the newspaper, though I told you about it.
[00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:18.721]  There were doubts being built before it was ever in the news.
[00:06:18.761 --> 00:06:19.302]  Now they admit it.
[00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:32.746]   I'm telling you currently there is a Major debate going on all over the world by the intelligentsia, both in government and in corporations, about what the next moves need to be.
[00:06:33.187 --> 00:06:37.890]  And there's a real sense that since the Cuban Missile Crisis, we've not been in this much danger.
[00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:43.395]  And we're in more danger now because the weapons are much more prolific and much more sophisticated and much more harder to stop.
[00:06:44.496 --> 00:06:46.077]  And I would say we have worse leadership now.
[00:06:46.798 --> 00:06:48.119]  But say what you want about John F. Kennedy.
[00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:49.060]  He was smart.
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:52.842]  He did a lot of research and had a good team around him.
[00:06:53.223 --> 00:06:56.145]  Kamala Harris and Joe Biden do not know what damn planet they are on.
[00:06:57.326 --> 00:07:08.734]  And so when I get back to Austin tomorrow, I'm going to have to write some notes, really collate this, and then really come to my decisions about what we need to do, what we need to stand for in Ukraine and where this is all going.
[00:07:08.754 --> 00:07:20.801]   But I think the bottom line is we need to de-escalate, give Putin a way out, space saving, So that the Russians, the government will assassinate him, because that's what the Russians do when a leader fails.
[00:07:22.302 --> 00:07:36.786]  And where they don't keep escalating the war, where NATO gets drawn in, because some of the Ukrainians or others, the thoracites might stage a chemical or biological false flag and say the Russians have done it.
[00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:38.327]  In fact, they've been pre-programming that.
[00:07:39.201 --> 00:07:47.675]  For the last three weeks and now they're saying the Russians are going to imminently, you see all the news, don't need me to tell you this, launch a chemical or biological attack.
[00:07:48.892 --> 00:08:06.446]  That would be the pretext for some of the maniacs, the darker forces of the globalist pantheon to get this big wider war they want and basically knock out a lot of civilization and then use that to bring in the global technocracy and tyranny and robots on the back of that.
[00:08:06.847 --> 00:08:28.715]   So first they're softening up the infrastructure, shutting down the grids, starving the third world, annihilating the supply chain, Introducing the idea of an ID to buy and sell a global social credit score and then have a limited nuclear war, they think they can have, which then brings in so much destabilization.
[00:08:28.795 --> 00:08:44.783]  It's the cover for all the billions that are going to die from these mRNA injections, which absolutely attack the double helix of the DNA and absolutely do turn off the regeneration system of humans.
[00:08:46.966 --> 00:08:48.046]  And so that's where we are.
[00:08:48.106 --> 00:08:49.967]  This is a very sophisticated attack.
[00:08:50.707 --> 00:08:56.788]  And again, if I was interdimensional aliens, destroying other civilizations that were developing, this is just how I do it.
[00:08:57.348 --> 00:09:02.709]  That fits in the Bible's cosmology of this fallen one that's ancient and manipulates humans.
[00:09:03.729 --> 00:09:07.190]  The only reason I take you there is 99% of us, we know what's going on.
[00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:10.030]  That last 1% of what's happening doesn't make sense.
[00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:12.750]  Why would the globalists want to do this?
[00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.811]  Why would they want to kill billions of people?
[00:09:14.831 --> 00:09:15.551]  Why would they want to knock?
[00:09:16.155 --> 00:09:23.661]  Much the planet back to the Stone Age and only have compartmentalized high technology reservations for themselves into the future.
[00:09:24.682 --> 00:09:29.606]  And they say it's basically as soon as they think they've got life extension, they're going to start killing the majority of the public.
[00:09:30.927 --> 00:09:33.289]  But they, again, understand they can't get away with that.
[00:09:33.309 --> 00:09:37.372]  If it's dramatic and open, like a vaccine you take, you die right away.
[00:09:37.432 --> 00:09:38.073]  Nobody would take it.
[00:09:38.433 --> 00:09:40.355]  If it kills you slowly, then they think they can do it.
[00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:42.066]  But then that's not enough.
[00:09:42.086 --> 00:09:45.491]  You need something to really destabilize and collapse civilization.
[00:09:45.891 --> 00:09:53.140]  So they talk about depopulation by the year 2030, and William Shatner says, I've met with the top people.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.341]  Everyone's about to die.
[00:09:54.381 --> 00:09:55.302]  The cataclysm's here.
[00:09:56.143 --> 00:10:02.206]   A few months ago, when you see Beto O'Rourke and you see AOC all saying, The same thing.
[00:10:02.266 --> 00:10:03.747]  Too bad we'll all be dead in 2030.
[00:10:03.867 --> 00:10:05.789]  It's coming.
[00:10:05.809 --> 00:10:06.389]  We're all dead.
[00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.311]  They're not being read into the whole program.
[00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:10.173]  They're being told, hey, this is coming.
[00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:16.098]  You better get in line with us if you're going to survive in bunkers, while the globalists then execute a plan that brings us into collapse.
[00:10:16.138 --> 00:10:27.348]  So here is Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Gutierrez, talking about the fact this is bone-chilling and we just got a lot closer to nuclear war.
[00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:35.616]  Finally, further escalation of the war, whether by accident or design, threatens all of humanity.
[00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:40.879]  Raising the alert of Russian nuclear forces is a bone-chilling development.
[00:10:41.979 --> 00:10:48.762]  The prospect of nuclear conflict, once unthinkable, is now back within the realm of possibility.
[00:10:49.723 --> 00:10:54.105]  The security and safety of nuclear facilities must also be preserved.
[00:10:55.191 --> 00:11:01.576]  It's time to stop the horror unleashed on the people of Ukraine and get on the path of diplomacy and peace.
[00:11:04.478 --> 00:11:06.139]  So let's talk about this.
[00:11:06.659 --> 00:11:07.620]  They're absolutely right.
[00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.701]  The time is to talk about deals.
[00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:12.143]  The time is to talk about an armistice.
[00:11:12.704 --> 00:11:22.951]  The time is to talk about, just like we did with the end of the Korean War or the ceasefire, have a demilitarized zone that's in that eastern area that the Russians want, that has always been part of Russia, and to end this now.
[00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.951]  NATO started this.
[00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:27.232]  I'm not glad about Russia's response.
[00:11:27.632 --> 00:11:30.114]  The point is, is that Russia's been manipulated into this.
[00:11:30.474 --> 00:11:31.795]  Putin now knows he's been trapped.
[00:11:33.115 --> 00:11:36.797]  And there are some smarter groups and forces that understand this is too dangerous.
[00:11:37.118 --> 00:11:40.560]  There are other globalist forces, as I said, that want to push this into total war.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:51.364]   Then meanwhile, meanwhile, Tulsi Gabbard and myself and people like Tucker Carlson, Are going, look, here's the biolabs that have the equivalent of bioweapons in them.
[00:11:51.724 --> 00:11:53.865]  And here's the UN admitting that they need to be destroyed.
[00:11:54.365 --> 00:11:57.047]  And these are left over from the Soviet Union, but have been updated.
[00:11:57.147 --> 00:12:01.709]  Peter Daszak, as usual, is involved, and he's Ukrainian.
[00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:05.311]  And all of this is happening, and we need to get rid of these.
[00:12:05.811 --> 00:12:09.093]  And instead they go, Mitt Romney says, no, arrest Tulsi Gabbard.
[00:12:09.133 --> 00:12:11.094]  I mean, The View, CNN, all of them.
[00:12:11.794 --> 00:12:13.355]  ABC, they're saying, arrest her.
[00:12:13.415 --> 00:12:14.776]  She's a terrorist.
[00:12:14.816 --> 00:12:15.556]  She's a traitor.
[00:12:16.072 --> 00:12:21.955]  She's all these horrible names because she's an army veteran and knows about chemical and biological weapons.
[00:12:22.015 --> 00:12:27.657]  And it's publicly admitted that these things are there, but the media said they weren't there.
[00:12:28.037 --> 00:12:30.278]  So at the same time, they're saying, okay, the labs are safe.
[00:12:30.298 --> 00:12:32.079]  We got them, but the Russians got two of the 25.
[00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:36.741]  So now we need to stop them from releasing a bioweapon, but the bioweapons don't exist.
[00:12:37.201 --> 00:12:39.302]  Lieutenant Carlson last night, I watched this morning.
[00:12:39.342 --> 00:12:41.303]  It's just like, this isn't even about Russia.
[00:12:41.323 --> 00:12:42.283]  This isn't even about Ukraine.
[00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:43.304]  This is about insanity.
[00:12:43.795 --> 00:12:46.495]  It's like saying, Alex Jones is not wearing a black shirt.
[00:12:46.736 --> 00:12:47.956]  And I'm wearing a black shirt on TV.
[00:12:47.976 --> 00:12:50.296]  Or Alex Jones is not holding a cup of coffee in his hand.
[00:12:50.536 --> 00:12:51.476]  And I've got the cup right here.
[00:12:52.197 --> 00:12:55.057]  Or Alex Jones is not holding an iPhone in his hand.
[00:12:55.097 --> 00:12:57.758]  Or Alex Jones does not have a black microphone in front of him.
[00:12:57.778 --> 00:12:59.278]  And I do have a black microphone in front of me, folks.
[00:13:00.218 --> 00:13:02.618]  So, you know, this is not a bag of sugar in my hand.
[00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:03.379]  Well, yes, it is.
[00:13:04.799 --> 00:13:08.719]  So this is the frustration here, is that they're just gaslighting everybody.
[00:13:08.759 --> 00:13:11.640]  Like, not just, oh, Tulsi Gabbards is a liar.
[00:13:12.662 --> 00:13:19.167]  But that Tulsi Gabbard is a traitor, because she is killing Willa Korstner's labs.
[00:13:19.608 --> 00:13:22.250]  Because they want that double think of 2 plus 2 equals whatever they say.
[00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.273]  So we're going to go on a break here, and I'm going to come back and play some of these clips.
[00:13:25.413 --> 00:13:27.795]  Owen has got a lot to cover as well today.
[00:13:27.855 --> 00:13:30.437]  Owen, take us out and tell us some of what you've got coming up today.
[00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:34.842]  Well, Alex, the news is breaking in such rapid fashion now.
[00:13:34.942 --> 00:13:45.928]  Just since we've been on air, two big news stories developing with the failed attempt by Jake Sullivan to get diplomacy with China and Saudi Arabia.
[00:13:46.428 --> 00:13:53.892]  Now China and Saudi Arabia are discussing switching to the yuan to make international purchases, specifically with gas and oil instead of the US dollar.
[00:13:53.912 --> 00:13:56.113]  I mean, you want to talk about the US collapsing?
[00:13:56.494 --> 00:14:00.934]   Folks, our lifestyle of prosperity and having a house with two stories and a pool in the
[00:14:00.934 --> 00:14:04.653]   backyard and having barbecues on the weekend, gone if that happens.
[00:14:04.653 --> 00:14:05.814]  Forget about it.
[00:14:05.814 --> 00:14:12.413]   And now Zelensky has come out and said Ukraine has no plans to join NATO.
[00:14:12.413 --> 00:14:15.333]  So the cogs are starting to click here.
[00:14:15.333 --> 00:14:20.653]   And it looks like for the most part, the West with Biden and Harris are the ones kind of
[00:14:20.653 --> 00:14:22.454]  being pushed back into submission.
[00:14:22.835 --> 00:14:26.037]  And now the struggle with Putin and Ukraine is going to become the real issue.
[00:14:26.477 --> 00:14:33.002]  But it appears that the latest developments are that Biden, Harris, sit down, shut up, or America's going to be crushed in all of this.
[00:14:34.583 --> 00:14:36.084]  That is exactly what's happening.
[00:14:36.124 --> 00:14:37.445]  And in fact, I wanted to get into that.
[00:14:37.485 --> 00:14:38.705]  I'm glad you just brought that up.
[00:14:39.226 --> 00:14:49.137]   We'll cover that when we come back, because even on the Guardian points out, These oil sanctions on Europe will bankrupt them and cause a Great Depression, already are, and it's not hurting the Russians.
[00:14:49.398 --> 00:14:51.560]  They'll just make more money where they do sell the oil.
[00:14:51.841 --> 00:14:56.226]  And then again, there's darker globalist forces manipulating this whole thing to collapse civilization.
[00:14:56.486 --> 00:14:57.287]  It's the info war.
[00:14:57.307 --> 00:14:57.748]  Stay with us.
[00:14:58.889 --> 00:15:02.373]  Ladies and gentlemen, again, we are back live on this Tuesday, March 15th.
[00:15:04.119 --> 00:15:04.760]  2022 transmission.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.461]  Owen Schroyer is riding shotgun with me.
[00:15:06.521 --> 00:15:08.001]  I'll be here with you most of the hour.
[00:15:08.462 --> 00:15:10.943]  Then Owen will be fully taking over here today.
[00:15:10.983 --> 00:15:16.086]  But going back to what you just said, Owen, absolutely that news was just breaking as we went live.
[00:15:16.846 --> 00:15:17.567]  That is huge.
[00:15:18.367 --> 00:15:24.890]  We have Saudi Arabia saying they may just go ahead and take Chinese money instead of taking the dollar.
[00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:35.798]   And to explain this, if you go back to Bretton Woods after World War II where it was decided That the dollar would be the world reserve currency that the purchase of oil would be made in around the world.
[00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.200]  If the U.S.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:47.027]  loses that and if China, the second largest oil user in the world, stops using dollars, that means the beginning of the end of the dollar.
[00:15:47.768 --> 00:15:53.292]  90% of world money transfer and oil transfers just 20 years ago was the dollar.
[00:15:54.533 --> 00:15:57.755]  It's only 62% last time I checked last week.
[00:15:57.896 --> 00:15:59.886]   Now, And that will accelerate it.
[00:15:59.906 --> 00:16:02.568]  Once you get 50%, people will basically leave the dollar.
[00:16:03.948 --> 00:16:11.231]  No one has devalued their currency over the long period as bad as we have and ever had their currency survive.
[00:16:11.271 --> 00:16:16.873]  But China's been devaluing as well, even faster than us, but for not as long.
[00:16:17.233 --> 00:16:20.115]  The EU's been doing it faster than us, but not as long.
[00:16:20.195 --> 00:16:22.175]  So again, we've been doing it for a long time.
[00:16:22.576 --> 00:16:29.214]   You know, a dollar a hundred years ago would buy a lavish meal and Uh, you know, a horse carriage ride back home.
[00:16:29.735 --> 00:16:32.156]  You know, probably a loaf of bread at the local store.
[00:16:32.816 --> 00:16:33.717]  Now, what does it get you?
[00:16:34.257 --> 00:16:38.959]  So, we all see what's going on and happening here, and they want a global reset.
[00:16:39.339 --> 00:16:46.543]  All the central banks say the new global digital systems coming, and it'll be a mix of all the currencies, but they've got to have an excuse to pledge it first.
[00:16:46.603 --> 00:16:47.744]  And what did I say three weeks ago?
[00:16:48.244 --> 00:16:53.934]   I said this war, if they put big sanctions on Russia, And then on China, we'll lead to leaving the dollar.
[00:16:54.335 --> 00:16:58.638]  China and Russia are obviously double dealing at the international level.
[00:16:59.819 --> 00:17:05.403]  The Davos Group only under pressure, decoupled from Putin, but they have him from Xi Jinping.
[00:17:06.044 --> 00:17:08.766]  And so China is the long-term big winner out of this.
[00:17:09.126 --> 00:17:11.368]  China is the beta test for the police state.
[00:17:11.388 --> 00:17:16.953]  They have 37 million people back under lockdown in China as just a martial law drill.
[00:17:17.766 --> 00:17:18.647]  We were here in L.A.
[00:17:18.687 --> 00:17:25.215]  and some of the crew, when I was at meetings, tried to go to the Comedy Store, and they said, no vaccine, you can't come in, even though it's not the law.
[00:17:25.615 --> 00:17:26.676]  Happened a bunch of other places.
[00:17:27.357 --> 00:17:33.764]  So, there's that tyranny overarching, but Putin is running into a lot more opposition than they thought.
[00:17:34.245 --> 00:17:38.890]  There's massive Western special forces there, British special forces.
[00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:43.112]  Well, recently out of the military just got killed.
[00:17:43.752 --> 00:17:56.000]  A couple hundred foreign soldiers got wounded when 30 got killed just in one barracks that they sent an international soldier in who was really a Russian spy.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:18:01.223]  He just called in rocket attacks onto the facility.
[00:18:01.283 --> 00:18:06.746]  So this is a SH-T show at every level and only can get worse.
[00:18:07.167 --> 00:18:18.437]   As Ron Paul wrote, just A few days ago in a big article we had in fullwords.com, is the United States Biden administration willing to fight Putin to the last Ukrainian?
[00:18:19.078 --> 00:18:20.739]  Because really, that's what this is.
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:29.389]  Putin, the globalist, overthrew their government, overthrew the Ukrainian elected government, started all these fights, put in the troops, put in the weapons to set up Russia.
[00:18:29.669 --> 00:18:30.470]  So that's bad.
[00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:32.112]  Russia taking the bait is bad.
[00:18:32.677 --> 00:18:37.742]  And now Russia beginning to lose is bad because they're not going to give up and it's just going to escalate from there.
[00:18:37.782 --> 00:18:38.903]  So I've basically gone over that.
[00:18:39.483 --> 00:18:54.517]  Even again, as I said, the London Guardian, you can look this up today, says that basically there'll be a depression and the Germans will go bankrupt in a year at current rates of energy prices because the left thinks or tells people, oh, don't worry if gas is $10 a gallon.
[00:18:55.649 --> 00:18:56.129]  Like it is.
[00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:00.731]  $9 a gallon in Chicago, $7 a gallon in most areas in California.
[00:19:01.251 --> 00:19:02.952]  Don't worry, because you'll just use electric.
[00:19:03.052 --> 00:19:12.455]  Well, electric almost all comes from coal and natural gas, less than 10% from turbines and, of course, hydroelectric.
[00:19:12.675 --> 00:19:13.676]  Hydroelectric is the best.
[00:19:14.176 --> 00:19:17.517]  But the left's been destroying hydroelectric everywhere.
[00:19:18.468 --> 00:19:21.549]  Uh, and tearing out and not updating them because, oh, they hurt fish!
[00:19:21.989 --> 00:19:26.191]  Just lie, after lie, after lie, after lie.
[00:19:26.211 --> 00:19:36.734]  So, and I've got some important clips dealing really with the police state now unfolding when we come back, but I wanted you to get more into all those news stories you've got that tie into this and get your angle on it.
[00:19:36.794 --> 00:19:40.915]  But, uh, to say Tucker Carlson is guilty of treason, to have a U.S.
[00:19:40.935 --> 00:19:50.855]   Senator say that, uh, Tulsi Gabbard's is, is a hundred times worse than what People like, of course, McCarthy did.
[00:19:51.175 --> 00:19:52.898]  I mean, this is so dangerous.
[00:19:53.599 --> 00:19:56.564]  And now they're censoring anybody that even shows the Russian perspective.
[00:19:57.267 --> 00:20:03.809]  I mean, they're calling for us to be censored, even though I'm just trying to have peace and trying to really just talk about all the different issues and what this is really doing.
[00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:04.949]  I'm pro-America, 100%.
[00:20:05.829 --> 00:20:13.171]  The people that drove this war and started this are the ones that are about to kill the dollar and destroy our standard of living, which is now already happening.
[00:20:13.211 --> 00:20:15.051]  I told people two years ago, you better get storable food.
[00:20:15.071 --> 00:20:17.012]  The lockdowns are going to go on and off forever.
[00:20:17.032 --> 00:20:19.613]  They're going to try to shut down family farms.
[00:20:19.913 --> 00:20:21.333]  You better get your storable food.
[00:20:21.393 --> 00:20:22.013]  It's going to run out.
[00:20:22.893 --> 00:20:24.894]  My Patriot has not been a month behind.
[00:20:25.868 --> 00:20:29.672]  In their history, they've got the biggest company in the US, the best.
[00:20:30.053 --> 00:20:33.317]  They are now a few weeks behind and are telling people that.
[00:20:34.117 --> 00:20:36.260]  But they told us, yeah, don't even really plug.
[00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:44.296]  I mean, because we're just so far behind, they'd rather be able to catch up and not be like other food companies that are always a few months behind.
[00:20:44.316 --> 00:20:46.918]  Well, they're already a few weeks behind at Preparaldalex.com.
[00:20:47.439 --> 00:20:51.883]  Everybody that got their orders a month or so ago was really smart, because now it's gotten right to you.
[00:20:52.663 --> 00:20:54.465]  So, this is very serious, folks.
[00:20:54.485 --> 00:20:56.887]  The supply chains are breaking down.
[00:20:56.927 --> 00:20:57.828]  This is by design.
[00:20:58.168 --> 00:20:59.549]  Klaus Schwab said they would do it.
[00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.012]  I'm not just blaming them now.
[00:21:02.812 --> 00:21:03.693]  Because I don't like them.
[00:21:03.713 --> 00:21:07.515]  They said, post-industrial world, you will own nothing, you will have nothing, you will like it.
[00:21:07.775 --> 00:21:08.856]  This is how they break our back.
[00:21:09.076 --> 00:21:09.956]  It's how they get control of us.
[00:21:10.016 --> 00:21:19.641]  Everybody this spring should be, even if you live in apartments or whatever, going out, getting seeds, planting tomatoes, planting potatoes, planting beans, planting Brussels sprouts, planting eggplant.
[00:21:19.782 --> 00:21:22.223]  My parents have a garden.
[00:21:22.995 --> 00:21:34.120]  That is a half acre that just in South Austin, so many Brussels sprouts, so many peppers, hot peppers, sweet peppers, so many corn.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.320]  Sometimes they grow that.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.641]  I mean, just everything.
[00:21:36.881 --> 00:21:37.581]  Tomatoes.
[00:21:38.081 --> 00:21:41.463]  And whenever I go there to eat, they're always just getting it out of their yard.
[00:21:42.804 --> 00:21:47.126]  And that's what we've got to start understanding is the globalists want to take away the prosperity.
[00:21:47.366 --> 00:21:49.567]  They want to have an excuse to do it while they pose as savers.
[00:21:49.827 --> 00:21:54.469]  So if we point out they started the war, there's a group above it hurting America and Russia and Ukraine.
[00:21:54.770 --> 00:22:04.395]  If we point out the 360 full-spectrum dominance system, then we can all think like a globalist, but from the perspective of knowing how they're operating and stopping them.
[00:22:04.915 --> 00:22:07.036]  So this is life and death to understand the sum of your debt.
[00:22:07.832 --> 00:22:10.439]  On that our standard of living has already slipped massively.
[00:22:10.679 --> 00:22:12.925]  We're more in debt than ever and we're going over the edge right now.
[00:22:13.735 --> 00:22:16.937]  Well, and that's the whole operating system of the Great Reset.
[00:22:16.997 --> 00:22:22.880]  It's to take things that we in the West have, quite frankly, taken for granted in the last couple generations.
[00:22:23.401 --> 00:22:23.941]  Staples!
[00:22:24.381 --> 00:22:28.403]  Having the ability to put gas in your vehicle and travel wherever you want, whenever you want.
[00:22:28.664 --> 00:22:40.991]  Having the ability to own a piece of land, or have a house that you own, and maybe a nice barbecue pit or a pool in the backyard, or having a school to send your kids to, or having a fridge full of food, maybe even having an extra fridge in the garage.
[00:22:41.611 --> 00:22:47.498]  All these things that have been staples and accessible for Americans in the past decades, all that's going to go away.
[00:22:48.039 --> 00:22:49.941]  And that's really what the Great Reset is about.
[00:22:50.001 --> 00:22:57.349]  But shifting back to Ukraine, Alex, you know, Zelensky, I think, is kind of in his final moments here.
[00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:02.592]  He's going to be addressing Congress tomorrow morning, I believe at 8 a.m.
[00:23:02.672 --> 00:23:03.873]  Central Time, 9 a.m.
[00:23:03.973 --> 00:23:04.373]  Eastern.
[00:23:04.733 --> 00:23:06.854]  It's probably going to be kind of his final plea.
[00:23:07.214 --> 00:23:09.315]  I think he realized that he's stepped into it here.
[00:23:09.615 --> 00:23:17.499]  He double-crossed Putin and made a deal with the globalists, and now they've stabbed him in the back, and even Germany is saying, no, we're not going to sanction Russia.
[00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:21.961]  So it's really just a mess, and I think world leaders are now saying, all right, you know what?
[00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:25.664]  That's why the UN is saying, you know what, we don't want nuclear war, let's step back.
[00:23:25.924 --> 00:23:37.874]  I think Putin's going to have a victory in Ukraine, or it's going to be all-out war and they'll either try to assassinate him or they'll nuke Ukraine or do a cyber attack or chemical attack and blame Putin to set up for a larger escalation.
[00:23:38.474 --> 00:23:46.019]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is what InfoWars was built for in times of war and propaganda and the Great Reset.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:51.083]  Owen Schroer live here in the studio, Alex Jones on the road on a working trip.
[00:23:51.103 --> 00:23:52.624]  Big things happening in California.
[00:23:52.684 --> 00:23:56.266]  We're trying to break down the latest news out of Ukraine, but it's developing so quickly, Alex.
[00:23:56.967 --> 00:24:05.433]   I have a feeling, though, We're going to have a lot clearer picture of what this is going to look like after this week and weekend because something is going to have to give.
[00:24:05.553 --> 00:24:19.503]  Either Russia is going to step up their attacks in Ukraine or the world is going to basically put America into a corner to say back off and then they'll just have their way with the EU and or NATO and Russia and Ukraine figuring it out.
[00:24:19.963 --> 00:24:38.040]   But you know what what I'm seeing Alex is With Zelensky coming to Congress, with all the propaganda in the media, with China, Saudi Arabia talking about using the yuan instead of the dollar, and now they're saying, oh look, China's economy's crashing, and oh look, Russia's economy's crashing.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.241]  The world elites have intentionally done this to the planet.
[00:24:41.781 --> 00:24:48.743]  Now they're trying to find their easiest way out, and it's going to be the people, the just common citizen of this planet that's going to pay the toll.
[00:24:49.183 --> 00:24:50.664]  That's what we want to avoid here.
[00:24:52.438 --> 00:24:53.579]  Well, very well said, Owen.
[00:24:53.599 --> 00:24:55.119]  That's exactly what's going on.
[00:24:55.299 --> 00:25:01.543]  And so people need to understand, I'm not being neutral on this because I want to be on everybody's side.
[00:25:01.983 --> 00:25:02.603]  It's the opposite.
[00:25:03.103 --> 00:25:08.926]  Our listeners in general hate the Democratic Party, hate the globalists, hate George Soros, and they should.
[00:25:09.446 --> 00:25:14.189]  And they are pro-Putin because they see it as, well, you know, he hates the globalists too.
[00:25:14.589 --> 00:25:16.490]  He's under globalist attack, so he must be good.
[00:25:17.771 --> 00:25:20.392]  All I'm saying is, is that he's walked into a trap.
[00:25:21.201 --> 00:25:25.122]  And the globalists wanted him to do this, and now it's driven Russia into China's arms.
[00:25:25.622 --> 00:25:29.963]  And China's now saying they are going to ship weapons to the Russians, including weaponized drones.
[00:25:30.963 --> 00:25:33.764]  And I'm talking about the big ones, like, you know, knockoffs of our Predators.
[00:25:34.904 --> 00:25:41.205]  So all of this is going on, and the globalists have bitten off a little bit more than they can chew.
[00:25:41.245 --> 00:25:43.485]  They wanted to push Russia around.
[00:25:43.525 --> 00:25:44.746]  They wanted to be able to take over.
[00:25:44.806 --> 00:25:46.386]  They figured they would put Russia in a trap.
[00:25:47.206 --> 00:25:50.887]  But now it's accelerating the collapse of the dollar so fast.
[00:25:51.625 --> 00:25:57.089]  That there are a lot of different powerful forces that now want a resolution of this.
[00:25:57.169 --> 00:26:01.252]  But there are a lot of globalist forces that want to continue to get worse.
[00:26:01.633 --> 00:26:03.954]  And make no mistake, a lot of those globalist forces are in Russia.
[00:26:04.455 --> 00:26:12.601]  You notice that all these oligarchs, I think it's 14 of them, 14 of the 30 or so oligarchs are Russian Jews.
[00:26:13.642 --> 00:26:35.457]   And it's being reported, and there's an article on InfoWars.com about it, that they have fled To Israel and it's in mainstream news that so they can get around the sanctions they have now suddenly said oh no actually we've got Israeli passports and now the Israeli government and others have come out and said basically it's anti-semitic if you put sanctions on them.
[00:26:35.977 --> 00:26:40.939]   So the reason I raise that point is To just show how it's all interconnected.
[00:26:41.079 --> 00:26:57.763]  There's American connections to Russia, there's Russian connections to Ukraine, Russian connections to Israel, and it's like Russia's like America in that it's got its Democrats and it's got its Conservatives and it's got all these different factions and groups as well.
[00:26:57.803 --> 00:27:01.563]  It's not like the Russia that we think of back in Stalin's time or something.
[00:27:02.244 --> 00:27:04.464]  And so Putin really doesn't even have full control.
[00:27:05.683 --> 00:27:09.006]  Shown by him launching this war and it's not going the way he thought.
[00:27:09.207 --> 00:27:11.649]  These governments are incompetent.
[00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.172]  The world's so big, it's so complex.
[00:27:15.613 --> 00:27:16.094]  Is the U.S.
[00:27:16.114 --> 00:27:17.575]  government more incompetent than Russia?
[00:27:17.615 --> 00:27:17.895]  Yes.
[00:27:18.036 --> 00:27:20.438]  Is our military a lot more competent than Russia?
[00:27:20.458 --> 00:27:21.699]  Yeah, because the U.S.
[00:27:21.739 --> 00:27:26.284]  military is going all the time and has super high tech systems of coordination.
[00:27:26.784 --> 00:27:27.925]  And the Russians don't have that.
[00:27:28.205 --> 00:27:29.985]  The Chinese have more of that than the Russians.
[00:27:30.425 --> 00:27:34.687]  And now that the Chinese are coming into the proxy war, that's why you're seeing the U.N.
[00:27:35.187 --> 00:27:37.628]  and NATO going, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:27:38.048 --> 00:27:43.450]  Because if they dump a thousand drones in there with their equivalent of hellfires that the U.S.
[00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:48.232]  is allowed to be a transfer of that technology, it's going to be a lot more serious a lot quicker.
[00:27:50.026 --> 00:27:56.811]  A larger takeaway is just the fact that everything we see the Russian government doing, censoring people, they're now starting to do here.
[00:27:57.211 --> 00:28:10.161]  And when you've got a military veteran and a former member of Congress who has the most popular polling numbers of any Democrat, Tulsi Gabbards, just going, yeah, these chemical labs, these bio labs are important and we need them shut down.
[00:28:10.181 --> 00:28:12.343]  The UN even said that.
[00:28:12.563 --> 00:28:14.204]  They're like, you're crazy, they don't exist!
[00:28:14.645 --> 00:28:17.106]  When they're on record existing, that's a big problem.
[00:28:17.126 --> 00:28:19.374]   So let's play Let's play this clip.
[00:28:19.414 --> 00:28:31.485]  Let's play Tulsi Gabbard's response, and then we'll play Tucker making the point that they're treating Tulsi Gabbard like she's Alex Jones, because Alex Jones questions things as well.
[00:28:31.825 --> 00:28:38.691]  So let's play Tulsi and her response, and let's play the Tucker-Gabbard-Jones clip right after that.
[00:28:39.804 --> 00:29:00.101]  Senator Romney, you've called me a treasonous liar simply for stating the fact that there are over 25 U.S.-funded biolabs in Ukraine which, if breached, would release and spread deadly pathogens across the United States and the world, and therefore they must be secured so that we can prevent any new pandemics from occurring.
[00:29:01.195 --> 00:29:11.879]  Now, bizarrely, you claim that securing these labs, or even calling for securing these labs, is treasonous and will lead to a loss of life, when the exact opposite is obviously true.
[00:29:11.939 --> 00:29:18.641]  The spread of pathogens is what will cause the loss of life, not the prevention of such a spread.
[00:29:20.242 --> 00:29:25.564]  So, Senator Romney, please provide evidence that what I've said is not true and treasonous.
[00:29:26.704 --> 00:29:29.406]  And if you cannot, you should do the honorable thing.
[00:29:30.027 --> 00:29:30.747]  Apologize.
[00:29:31.207 --> 00:29:32.208]  Resign from the U.S.
[00:29:32.248 --> 00:29:32.548]  Senate.
[00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:42.456]  Evidence of the existence of these biolabs in Ukraine, their vulnerability, and therefore the need to take immediate action to secure them, is beyond dispute.
[00:29:43.597 --> 00:29:52.284]  Just the other day, the State Department's Victoria Nuland acknowledged that these labs, that contain dangerous pathogens, exist in Ukraine in her testimony to the U.S.
[00:29:52.324 --> 00:29:52.604]  Senate.
[00:29:53.724 --> 00:30:10.052]  Ukraine has biological research facilities, which in fact we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of.
[00:30:10.212 --> 00:30:18.484]   So we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into
[00:30:18.484 --> 00:30:22.753]   the hands of Russian forces should they approach.
[00:30:22.753 --> 00:30:27.954]   In a Pentagon fact sheet dated March 11th, there are numerous statements that both directly
[00:30:27.954 --> 00:30:32.634]  and indirectly confirm the existence of these biolabs.
[00:30:32.634 --> 00:30:38.353]   The United States, through BTRP, has invested approximately $200 million in Ukraine since
[00:30:38.353 --> 00:30:46.994]   2005, supporting 46 Ukrainian laboratories, health facilities, and diagnostic sites.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:31:00.223]  On CBS Face the Nation on March 13th, CBS national security correspondent David Martin said that he'd spoken to a Pentagon official just that morning who told him they're concerned about the existence of these biolabs in Ukraine.
[00:31:00.884 --> 00:31:14.891]   The concern is that the Russians will seize one of these biomedical research facilities that Ukraine has where they do research on Deadly pathogens like botulism and anthrax.
[00:31:15.611 --> 00:31:22.699]  Seize one of those facilities, weaponize the pathogen, and then blame it on Ukraine and the U.S.
[00:31:22.759 --> 00:31:23.580]  because the U.S.
[00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:29.086]  has been providing support for some of the research being done in those facilities.
[00:31:30.325 --> 00:31:35.050]  In April of 2020, in refuting Russia's accusations that the U.S.
[00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:39.374]  was using biolabs in Ukraine to develop biological weapons, the U.S.
[00:31:39.434 --> 00:31:47.881]  Embassy in Ukraine acknowledged that there are U.S.-funded labs in Ukraine working with pathogens for vaccines and other peaceful purposes.
[00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:56.176]  In a CNN fact check on March 10th, 2022, there are U.S.-funded biolabs in Ukraine.
[00:31:56.497 --> 00:31:57.397]  That much is true.
[00:31:58.278 --> 00:32:04.524]  Furthermore, according to the DoD, there are two biolabs in Ukraine that have been under Russian control for quite some time.
[00:32:06.058 --> 00:32:17.405]  Russia illegally took possession of two Ukrainian owned laboratories that BTRP upgraded in 2014 and continues to deny Ukrainian access to these facilities.
[00:32:17.926 --> 00:32:20.267]  So Senator Romney, you have a choice.
[00:32:21.368 --> 00:32:25.671]  Out of pride, continue to deny the truth or admit that you're wrong.
[00:32:26.131 --> 00:32:27.892]  Apologize and resign.
[00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:29.533]  Aloha.
[00:32:29.954 --> 00:32:34.897]  And remember that without the truth, we can be neither safe nor free.
[00:32:37.458 --> 00:32:42.561]  You know, you can say what you want about her, but, I mean, she just comes off as like an angel.
[00:32:43.082 --> 00:32:49.646]  And I know she went to class swap school, and I know, but, I mean, she could also turn back towards the light and not judge a tree by its fruits.
[00:32:50.947 --> 00:32:52.668]  And, you know, she's becoming more pro-life.
[00:32:52.688 --> 00:32:53.488]  She's on her way there.
[00:32:53.508 --> 00:32:55.350]  She's becoming pro-Second Amendment.
[00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:58.632]  And I can tell you, the Republicans at the highest levels are scared of her.
[00:32:59.092 --> 00:33:01.053]  And we are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:01.113 --> 00:33:03.815]  Alex Jones here, riding shotgun with Owen Schroeder.
[00:33:03.935 --> 00:33:05.556]  Owen will be co-hosting again tomorrow.
[00:33:05.596 --> 00:33:06.617]  I'll be back in town.
[00:33:07.439 --> 00:33:11.882]  Tomorrow as well, got some other very important things we're doing out here in California.
[00:33:12.423 --> 00:33:17.006]  Already had some of my meetings about the state of the world and the Russia crisis with some top brains.
[00:33:17.446 --> 00:33:18.667]  Very blessed to talk to them.
[00:33:19.208 --> 00:33:23.391]  And then I'm going to do some really, really interesting big podcasts today.
[00:33:23.411 --> 00:33:27.073]  Be working pretty late in the evening and I'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
[00:33:27.153 --> 00:33:32.337]  Pray for peace, folks, because again, the world is hurtling into a real crisis right now, deepening.
[00:33:33.425 --> 00:33:34.105]  Of the crisis.
[00:33:34.125 --> 00:33:39.487]  Infowars.com is a beacon of full-spectrum analysis so you can make your own decisions.
[00:33:39.507 --> 00:33:51.512]  We really just try to tell you the truth, do our best research, have our best guests on, and we have a really good track record compared to any other media outlet out there of having accuracy.
[00:33:51.632 --> 00:33:57.294]  And I can tell you that's recognized by governments and corporations around the world.
[00:33:58.455 --> 00:34:10.154]   And so when I tell you that, it's not to toot our horn, So listeners and others and also foolish leftists that just make fun of us and think that that keeps people from the truth or that that demonizes us.
[00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:23.940]   It's just not working and praise God their attempts to shut down any real debate or long-term conversation about the new world order has failed and so now The globalists denying that bio labs exist in Ukraine that were U.S.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.403]  funded just makes them look like bigger liars.
[00:34:26.483 --> 00:34:32.890]  It doesn't work anymore, the gaslighting, or denying there's a world government being formed, or denying the Democrats are trying to sexualize children.
[00:34:32.910 --> 00:34:38.355]  The governor of Santa's trying to, you know, pass a law that you don't teach seven-year-olds how to get blowjobs.
[00:34:38.415 --> 00:34:39.997]  I mean, I'm sorry, that's what they teach.
[00:34:40.057 --> 00:34:41.839]  Sex-ed the seven-year-olds.
[00:34:42.099 --> 00:34:43.921]  They teach little boys they're girls, and girls they're boys.
[00:34:44.907 --> 00:34:50.568]  And even Bill Maher said last weekend, he said, you shouldn't be targeting children about sex talk.
[00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:51.808]  Anyway, they're children.
[00:34:51.868 --> 00:34:53.288]  That's sexualizing children.
[00:34:53.328 --> 00:34:54.169]  That's pedophilia.
[00:34:54.949 --> 00:35:03.150]  And I mean, the sickening footage that Owen and the crew got this weekend in Austin of people saying, we want access to the kids.
[00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:06.131]  We're going to let them decide what sex they are when they're five years old.
[00:35:06.391 --> 00:35:13.552]  These are other people, adults, wanting access to your children in schools and culture to talk about their sexual future and who they are.
[00:35:14.443 --> 00:35:18.246]  I mean, if somebody's 18 and they want to go be kinky and do a bunch of weird stuff, that's their deal.
[00:35:18.706 --> 00:35:22.309]  But leave the frickin' kids alone.
[00:35:22.369 --> 00:35:23.530]  Hands off the kids.
[00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:26.772]  So the left has lost even Bill Maher, you damn scum.
[00:35:26.892 --> 00:35:39.041]  And I mean, I tell you, I've never seen such filth, such weak, demonic sacks of garbage as these people that want to sexualize children.
[00:35:39.081 --> 00:35:40.182]  These pedophile enablers.
[00:35:40.242 --> 00:35:41.483]  I'm not saying they're all pedophiles.
[00:35:42.225 --> 00:35:48.974]  Uh, but I would imagine if you went and ran the plates, uh, of that crowd out there, that you would find some really scary stuff.
[00:35:49.014 --> 00:35:50.556]  And I'm, I'm the guy that pioneered.
[00:35:50.596 --> 00:35:51.157]  I'm not bragging.
[00:35:51.197 --> 00:35:53.600]  I just think Comet said stuff to go to Drag Queen Storytime.
[00:35:54.721 --> 00:35:55.923]  Have people hire PIs.
[00:35:56.693 --> 00:35:57.574]  We're off-duty.
[00:35:57.754 --> 00:35:58.935]  We've done it ourselves before.
[00:35:59.835 --> 00:36:04.598]  And just go around the plates, these people, and then, uh, oh, this person's a convicted rapist of an eight-year-old.
[00:36:04.859 --> 00:36:06.700]  This guy's a convicted rapist of a six-year-old.
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:08.301]  This guy's a two-time rapist.
[00:36:08.741 --> 00:36:09.282]  And you know what?
[00:36:09.502 --> 00:36:12.764]  We call the police, and they go grab him, and they go back to prison.
[00:36:15.143 --> 00:36:21.165]  And that's why you don't see a lot of drag queen storytelling anymore, because people go, oh, run their damn, yeah, run their plates.
[00:36:21.605 --> 00:36:22.406]  Send them to jail.
[00:36:22.626 --> 00:36:33.409]  Of course dudes in clown outfits that want to bounce your five-year-old on their leg are statistically gonna, I mean, we said openly, run the San Francisco gay choir's names.
[00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:39.452]  Because they were going, we're gonna meet your children, we'll have them, we'll take them, we're gonna do stuff to them.
[00:36:40.492 --> 00:36:42.473]  Everybody said, run their names.
[00:36:42.533 --> 00:36:49.918]   And it was like, I mean, this is what we're dealing with here.
[00:36:49.978 --> 00:36:57.945]  So, I mean, you talk about this, and then the useful idiots that actually just believe they're fighting for rights and they're civil rights activists.
[00:36:59.346 --> 00:37:00.707]  Because MSNBC told them.
[00:37:01.468 --> 00:37:06.512]  So the wheels are coming off the new world order, their whole system is falling apart, and we are in an incredible time in history.
[00:37:06.532 --> 00:37:10.736]  Let me do this right now, before we get to these clips and then no one takes over and does a splendid job.

[00:38:34.471 --> 00:38:34.791]  888-253-3139.
[00:38:35.412 --> 00:38:38.354]  And this is the last day.
[00:38:39.034 --> 00:38:42.537]  It was going to be yesterday, but it's still up to today.
[00:38:42.557 --> 00:38:43.938]  So this last day is about to sell out.
[00:38:44.386 --> 00:38:46.567]  We have Vitamin D3, Winter Sun, 50% off.
[00:38:47.107 --> 00:38:52.249]  And we have, of course, X3, all three types of the iodine for your immune system, your whole body, your thyroid.
[00:38:52.269 --> 00:38:53.870]  That is 50% off today.
[00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:55.691]  It is the last day.
[00:38:56.071 --> 00:38:57.471]  So take advantage of that.
[00:38:57.511 --> 00:38:59.052]  Let's get back to that clip I mentioned.
[00:38:59.492 --> 00:39:02.353]  Then I'm going to hand the baton over to the great Owen Schroeder.
[00:39:02.714 --> 00:39:05.055]  Here is Carlson explaining.
[00:39:06.215 --> 00:39:08.296]  It's like a 16-minute clip edited out of two and a half minutes.
[00:39:08.739 --> 00:39:14.179]   that, "Oh my God, Tulsi Gabbard's is evil, she's Alex Jones, because she's pointing out real things
[00:39:14.179 --> 00:39:18.818]   that are admitted, and they're trying to gaslight us, and saying it doesn't exist." While separately
[00:39:18.818 --> 00:39:23.139]   they go, "We've got to save these labs from the Russians, these have deadly bio-weapons in them,
[00:39:23.139 --> 00:39:27.539]   but we don't have any labs, and they don't exist." And Tulsi Gabbard's is guilty of treason.
[00:39:27.539 --> 00:39:33.219]   With a US senator saying that, "No, Mr. Romney, you are the one."
[00:39:33.402 --> 00:39:35.663]  You warmongering neocon lying fraud.
[00:39:36.063 --> 00:39:37.805]  You are the enemy of America.
[00:39:37.965 --> 00:39:41.107]  You are the one engaged in treason against our First Amendment.
[00:39:41.487 --> 00:39:42.347]  And that's all I can say.
[00:39:42.788 --> 00:39:46.610]  I pray to God that Mitt Romney and all of these types be exposed.
[00:39:47.050 --> 00:39:48.051]  Okay, here's the clip.
[00:39:48.591 --> 00:39:55.676]  Indeed, by mentioning NATO, a topic that is completely off limits in American media, Zelensky may have gone too far.
[00:39:56.844 --> 00:40:07.487]  Daily in every possible venue we are told that NATO is paradoxically both of its central importance to the United States and at the same time irrelevant to what happens in Eastern Europe.
[00:40:08.588 --> 00:40:09.488]  Sound insane?
[00:40:09.508 --> 00:40:11.448]  Well then you can still think clearly.
[00:40:11.989 --> 00:40:19.691]  Yeah, she hates our country because she's worried that a pathogen might escape from a biolab and hurt people.
[00:40:21.095 --> 00:40:24.916]  There's no recent precedent for that, so she's clearly listening to Alex Jones too much.
[00:40:24.996 --> 00:40:26.237]  And she's treasonous.
[00:40:26.657 --> 00:40:30.198]  Actually, everything that Tulsi Gabbard said, as you know, is true.
[00:40:30.218 --> 00:40:31.218]  It's not a Republican issue.
[00:40:31.238 --> 00:40:32.038]  It's not a Democrat issue.
[00:40:32.138 --> 00:40:33.119]  It's a factual issue.
[00:40:33.219 --> 00:40:35.199]  And even in war, truth is a defense.
[00:40:35.239 --> 00:40:36.360]  In fact, it's the only defense.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.380]  Is it true?
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.541]  In a free country, you can speak the truth.
[00:40:40.501 --> 00:40:41.141]  Really?
[00:40:41.181 --> 00:40:44.282]  They used to arrest people for saying stuff like this.
[00:40:44.662 --> 00:40:48.224]  Hmm, when did they arrest people for saying stuff like this?
[00:40:48.244 --> 00:40:49.664]  And who is they, exactly?
[00:40:50.339 --> 00:40:56.803]  Well, the former Karen Elaine Johnson didn't tell us, she kept it vague because that way it's a lot more threatening and maybe you will shut up.
[00:40:56.863 --> 00:40:59.544]  And again, we hesitate to show clips from that show, it's an IQ killer.
[00:40:59.964 --> 00:41:04.007]  They don't care about Ukraine, a lot of these people, any more than they cared about George Floyd.
[00:41:04.807 --> 00:41:11.571]  They use tragedy, George Floyd's death, the tragic invasion of Ukraine, for domestic political purposes.
[00:41:12.111 --> 00:41:15.133]  This has unleashed something really dark in the United States.
[00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:22.631]   In order to make wise decisions, you have to be rational, Thoughtful, forward-thinking, and calm.
[00:41:23.531 --> 00:41:25.091]  And they're the opposite of all of those things.
[00:41:25.952 --> 00:41:28.232]  So they tell us that Putin is mentally ill.
[00:41:29.193 --> 00:41:32.393]  We can't assess that, contrary to what you may have heard, we don't text with Putin.
[00:41:33.094 --> 00:41:41.916]  But if that's true, and it certainly may be true, almost nobody in the Russian government seems to have anticipated the invasion of Ukraine, so he's clearly volatile, at the least.
[00:41:43.818 --> 00:41:53.166]  Why would you ever risk getting into a full-blown war with a volatile, crazy person who has thousands of nuclear weapons?
[00:41:53.346 --> 00:41:54.707]  What would happen if you did that?
[00:41:55.348 --> 00:41:59.491]  Maybe we think beyond today, just for a moment, but no one is.
[00:41:59.511 --> 00:42:04.416]  Because American borders don't matter, but Ukraine's borders are so important we will risk nuclear war for them?
[00:42:05.296 --> 00:42:07.078]  You can't say that enough, because it's real.
[00:42:10.282 --> 00:42:11.022]  Very powerful.
[00:42:11.042 --> 00:42:15.144]  We've got some other Tucker Carlson clips that we're going to be playing as well.
[00:42:15.184 --> 00:42:18.245]  In fact, I've got time to get to one of those.
[00:42:18.305 --> 00:42:21.706]  We'll cover that in the last segment coming up here in just a moment.
[00:42:21.766 --> 00:42:24.967]  Oh, and what else are you going to be covering the next few hours of the broadcast?
[00:42:25.546 --> 00:42:29.008]  My goodness, just a loaded news desk here, Alex.
[00:42:29.268 --> 00:42:36.372]  Let's not forget about the ongoing globalist operation of depopulation with these vaccines, and it's just sad.
[00:42:36.472 --> 00:42:43.436]  Fauci's putting himself back into the news, as is the CEO of Pfizer, saying, you need more vaccines, we're going to have at least four.
[00:42:43.956 --> 00:42:45.678]  We're never going to be out of this pandemic.
[00:42:46.339 --> 00:42:48.041]  Meanwhile, you have the same thing happening.
[00:42:48.121 --> 00:42:49.142]  Dies suddenly.
[00:42:49.462 --> 00:42:50.343]  Blood clots.
[00:42:50.704 --> 00:42:52.045]  Children having strokes.
[00:42:52.285 --> 00:42:53.026]  Oh, it's normal.
[00:42:53.086 --> 00:42:53.967]  Nothing to see here.
[00:42:54.488 --> 00:42:58.412]  Even though in multiple countries now, including Thailand and Vancouver...
[00:42:59.193 --> 00:43:05.378]  Health officials are actually taking a step back and saying, wait a second, we need to reevaluate these vaccines.
[00:43:05.418 --> 00:43:06.759]  We need to pause these vaccines.
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:09.722]  They're even doing massive payouts for vaccine injuries.
[00:43:10.242 --> 00:43:11.363]  That's just one step of it.
[00:43:11.563 --> 00:43:14.926]  We've got another Clinton associate getting busted for pedophilia.
[00:43:15.226 --> 00:43:19.250]  We've got another Democrat mayor candidate getting busted for pedophilia.
[00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:21.031]  I mean, it's just, it's everywhere, Alex.
[00:43:21.091 --> 00:43:21.972]  It's the infowar.
[00:43:22.232 --> 00:43:22.893]  It never stops.
[00:43:23.493 --> 00:43:27.794]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, I'm very blessed and thankful that you were able to join us today.
[00:43:27.814 --> 00:43:30.135]  I'm very blessed and thankful that we haven't had a nuclear war yet.
[00:43:30.195 --> 00:43:36.917]  I'm very blessed and thankful for the amazing crew and Owen Schroyer and just a fabulous job they're doing.
[00:43:36.937 --> 00:43:40.638]  I didn't get a chance to listen to the show yesterday when I got home last night.
[00:43:41.378 --> 00:43:49.621]  I watched my hour of the second hour and it just really great to be part of this organization and I want the listeners to know when I tell you this, I'm not patronizing you.
[00:43:50.465 --> 00:43:51.987]  You are the reason this has all happened.
[00:43:52.047 --> 00:43:55.831]  And as Owens keeps saying, we were all born for this.
[00:43:56.732 --> 00:44:05.361]  And InfoWars was meant at this time to really have a brain trust of knowledge and research to independently face down the new world order.
[00:44:05.401 --> 00:44:10.146]  And I can tell you, it is getting to the highest levels of corporations and governments everywhere.
[00:44:10.166 --> 00:44:17.506]   Because when they hear our show, They know the information is the same stuff they're getting briefed on secretly, but we've reverse engineered it.
[00:44:17.906 --> 00:44:23.229]  And we also have different perspectives than what these intelligence agencies that are controlled by globalists are telling them.
[00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:30.514]  And so I cannot stress enough to all of you how important the work is we've done here and why the enemy hates us so much and is so mad at us.
[00:44:31.034 --> 00:44:35.697]  And it's only your action and your prayers and your financial support that's done this.
[00:44:35.998 --> 00:44:37.439]  So we're in trouble.
[00:44:37.459 --> 00:44:38.139]  The world's in trouble.
[00:44:38.179 --> 00:44:40.000]  We got a fighting chance thanks to you.
[00:44:40.561 --> 00:44:43.003]  And I cannot thank the viewers and listeners enough.
[00:44:43.023 --> 00:44:43.963]  I want to salute you.
[00:44:43.983 --> 00:44:45.725]  And I want to just tell you, God bless you.
[00:44:46.085 --> 00:44:48.907]  Here's another clip I wanted to get to on Tucker and the BioLabs.
[00:44:49.247 --> 00:44:51.949]  The great Owen Schroer will take over the balance of transmission.
[00:44:52.289 --> 00:45:08.371]   And I want to ask listeners again, The propaganda would not be necessary if the situation was hopeless, but you've got to counter the propaganda by remembering to tell everybody about the clips, the shows, the articles, the videos, and then tell them to share it, and tell them to tell those they tell to share it, and that completes the Chan reaction.
[00:45:08.571 --> 00:45:10.612]  Here's Tucker Carlson, that Owen Schroer takes over.
[00:45:11.277 --> 00:45:23.345]  You know, if you take three steps back, the problem with the debate that we're having over Ukraine and Russia, and particularly with biolabs in Ukraine, isn't that people disagree about what the facts are.
[00:45:24.165 --> 00:45:30.910]  It's that nobody involved seems to be able to think clearly, think rationally, think empirically.
[00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:37.434]  Everyone seems to have gone crazy, and that's bad because the people who have gone crazy are the ones making all of the decisions.
[00:45:37.474 --> 00:45:39.975]  So it's not really about this specific issue.
[00:45:40.816 --> 00:45:43.738]  It's about our leader's capacity to lead.
[00:45:44.909 --> 00:45:47.031]  But the bioweapons story is just a perfect illustration.
[00:45:47.071 --> 00:45:53.035]  So we just talked to Tulsi Gabbard, who was denounced as treasonous and potentially a murderer by a sitting U.S.
[00:45:53.075 --> 00:45:55.336]  Senator, admittedly it was Mitt Romney, but he spoke for many.
[00:45:56.157 --> 00:46:02.962]  Because she said, look, Toria Nuland, Undersecretary of State, has said under oath there are biolabs in Ukraine.
[00:46:04.588 --> 00:46:10.330]  And the contents of those labs, because it's a war zone, they haven't been secured, could wind up in the wrong hands.
[00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:12.511]  To which Tulsi Gabbard said, holy smokes, this is a big deal.
[00:46:12.591 --> 00:46:13.271]  I serve in the U.S.
[00:46:13.331 --> 00:46:13.531]  Army.
[00:46:13.591 --> 00:46:14.312]  We don't want that.
[00:46:15.152 --> 00:46:19.113]  By the way, we know that bio labs can sometimes cause massive problems for the world.
[00:46:19.153 --> 00:46:20.094]  I think we've just seen that.
[00:46:21.194 --> 00:46:23.035]  So then, so that was Tulsi Gabbard's point.
[00:46:23.854 --> 00:46:28.238]  The New York Times was quick to denounce us for even talking about the subject.
[00:46:28.578 --> 00:46:30.900]  Oh, don't call them bioweapons.
[00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:33.242]  We never alleged the United States was making bioweapons.
[00:46:33.322 --> 00:46:34.162]  We don't know that.
[00:46:34.603 --> 00:46:39.707]  What we said is what's factually true, which is there are stores, we learned this from the U.S.
[00:46:39.727 --> 00:46:45.712]  government, of Soviet-era bioweapons in Ukraine that for some reason have not yet been destroyed.
[00:46:47.188 --> 00:46:49.148]  That's a huge problem, potentially.
[00:46:49.848 --> 00:46:52.529]  And the New York Times admitted that in their attack of us.
[00:46:52.569 --> 00:46:53.629]  Here's the quote, we'll just put it up.
[00:46:53.969 --> 00:47:04.771]  Mr. Pope, this is Robert Pope who runs the program, had warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine may damage laboratories in the country that conduct research and disease surveillance and are supported by the United States.
[00:47:05.431 --> 00:47:12.412]  He noted that some of the facilities may contain pathogens once used for Soviet-era bioweapons programs.
[00:47:12.872 --> 00:47:16.153]  But he emphasized the Ukrainian labs did not have the ability to manufacture bioweapons.
[00:47:17.995 --> 00:47:19.396]  Well, we quoted him too!
[00:47:20.236 --> 00:47:21.336]  That's true!
[00:47:22.157 --> 00:47:23.437]  And it's terrifying.
[00:47:23.937 --> 00:47:36.142]  And if we can't respond to it, because everyone's afraid of being called a tool of a foreign country, people who are trying their very hardest with the greatest level of sincerity to protect the United States, then we have lost the threat.
[00:47:36.942 --> 00:47:41.944]  Then we can't lead the world, we can't even lead our own country, if people like that are in charge.
[00:47:45.842 --> 00:48:01.532]  So there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, and you know why they're coming after Tucker Carlson and Gutfeld, and then I've got another clip from Fox News where Rachel Campos Duffy is just trying to tell the truth about Ukraine, and then you see the Warhawks that sit next to her on the couch shaking their heads like, no!
[00:48:01.872 --> 00:48:02.772]  That's not the narrative!
[00:48:03.613 --> 00:48:06.115]  That's not the narrative, and it's always the same people I notice.
[00:48:06.715 --> 00:48:11.338]  It's always the same people at Fox News, never seen a war they didn't want someone else to die in.
[00:48:12.639 --> 00:48:22.061]  Glad, honored to be sitting here in the Info Wars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas, guest hosting the Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:22.121 --> 00:48:30.422]  He has departed now, and so I kind of want to hit a reset button here on the transmission and tell you what's coming up, but let me quickly just tease.
[00:48:31.523 --> 00:48:35.543]  Alex is going to be on a couple exciting podcasts.
[00:48:35.563 --> 00:48:37.384]  I'm not sure when they're supposed to be.
[00:48:38.567 --> 00:48:43.769]  Published, but he'll be recording two very exciting podcasts this afternoon, at least two.
[00:48:44.769 --> 00:48:49.231]  And I'm looking forward to when those do go public.
[00:48:50.671 --> 00:48:58.254]  But let me just tell you, coming up today, we still have Sean Stone, who's going to be in studio.
[00:48:58.914 --> 00:49:13.216]   And I want to continue to cover the documentary his father made, award-winning filmmaker, Ukraine on fire, that they're trying to censor right now because it gets into the political corruption in Ukraine, including the Western's involvement.
[00:49:14.417 --> 00:49:30.064]  Which is really kind of the big hitch here, is that yeah, we live in a global economy and everything's kind of connected, but it's a fragile, delicate balance.
[00:49:32.193 --> 00:49:37.236]  That everybody kind of wants to keep intact, you would think, unless you wanted to collapse the world economy.
[00:49:37.276 --> 00:49:43.741]  So, why are U.S.
[00:49:43.881 --> 00:49:45.502]  interests so involved in Ukraine?
[00:49:45.522 --> 00:49:55.129]  Well, that's because our corrupt politicians like the Bidens and Pelosi's and others have been using Ukraine as a criminal operating front.
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:50:02.441]  And so now the American people have to suffer and get involved with potential larger conflict because of our corrupt leaders again.
[00:50:03.381 --> 00:50:04.581]  And so I'm just sick of that.
[00:50:05.342 --> 00:50:13.763]  I don't want the corrupt Biden crime family and its crimes in Ukraine to drag my country into a war it has no involvement in otherwise.
[00:50:15.263 --> 00:50:24.245]  But we'll get into that and more with Sean Stone coming up in the next hour and then Wayne Allen Root hosting the fourth hour.
[00:50:26.044 --> 00:50:39.134]  I'm not sure when I'm going to be able to get to all this news on my desk, if I'm going to be able to do it on the Alex Jones Show, or if I'm imagining most of it's going to be held over to the War Room that I'm hosting today as well.
[00:50:40.475 --> 00:50:44.938]  But I've got more news in regards to what's going on in Ukraine.
[00:50:45.078 --> 00:50:46.479]  I'm going to get to that stack.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:54.185]  Let's not forget about the current operation that's underway with the population control and the medical tyranny with the vaccines.
[00:50:56.741 --> 00:51:10.335]  I mean, folks, they're trying to act like it's normal for teenagers and healthy 20-year-olds, many of them athletes, to now be suffering from strokes and heart attacks and sudden death.
[00:51:13.018 --> 00:51:18.383]  And meanwhile, you've got Fauci and the Pfizer CEO saying, more vaccines, more vaccines, more, more, more!
[00:51:19.605 --> 00:51:26.591]  Meanwhile, even people that took maybe their first dose or second dose are saying, wait a second, it's unlimited doses now?
[00:51:26.611 --> 00:51:28.092]  I just did this to get along.
[00:51:28.112 --> 00:51:29.994]  I just did this because I got pressured by my family.
[00:51:30.054 --> 00:51:33.076]  I just did this because I got pressured by my employer.
[00:51:33.116 --> 00:51:35.939]  I just did this because you told me I'd get back to normal if we all just did this.
[00:51:36.019 --> 00:51:36.880]  I was a team player.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:41.323]  Now you're telling me that I've just joined on to your medical tyranny system?
[00:51:41.463 --> 00:51:42.004]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:51:43.183 --> 00:51:43.923]  But that's what's going on.
[00:51:45.084 --> 00:51:49.105]  I've got this stack of important political news that's happening in America that needs to be covered.
[00:51:49.585 --> 00:51:51.266]  I've got a stack of cultural news.
[00:51:51.406 --> 00:51:55.388]  I've got, you know, there is a trucker convoy in D.C., by the way.
[00:51:56.188 --> 00:52:02.110]  We barely have covered it recently just because of all the other bigger news, but I mean, there's a trucker convoy in D.C.
[00:52:03.831 --> 00:52:22.288]   and it's kind of my understanding, and I've talked to people who've been covering it, I've talked to a few people in it, that basically They're kind of playing ball with law enforcement and they've really had their convoy handicapped by law enforcement that they want to cooperate with.
[00:52:23.009 --> 00:52:24.150]  So I think that's why...
[00:52:25.603 --> 00:52:31.626]  Any interested media has kind of backed off the coverage because I'm not trying to slight these people.
[00:52:31.706 --> 00:52:32.466]  I salute them.
[00:52:32.546 --> 00:52:33.207]  I pray for them.
[00:52:33.247 --> 00:52:35.588]  And I say Godspeed on your mission for America.
[00:52:35.768 --> 00:52:40.830]  But they did kind of buckle to the DC law enforcement.
[00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:46.253]  And so it's kind of been a bit of a neutered convoy, if you will.
[00:52:46.493 --> 00:52:48.374]  I don't mean that as a disrespect or a slight.
[00:52:48.954 --> 00:52:51.015]  I'm just telling you that's kind of been the case.
[00:52:51.035 --> 00:52:52.636]  But it looks like they might be ramping it up.
[00:52:52.716 --> 00:52:54.677]  So we may be getting into some of that.
[00:52:56.248 --> 00:53:05.166]   Just hilarious news quite frankly with the left's current Cultural revolution of the new religion of how gay you are
[00:53:05.166 --> 00:53:11.927]   It's like a new priest class of who's the gayest or who who can who can have more sexual reassignment surgeries?
[00:53:11.927 --> 00:53:17.568]   It's just madness and then just being openly bigoted in the classroom where they're now
[00:53:17.568 --> 00:53:23.568]   intentionally segregating white students and black students and telling the white students you're bad and then
[00:53:23.688 --> 00:53:30.007]   Encouraging the black students to bully the white students so they can say oh see this is what your ancestors did you
[00:53:30.007 --> 00:53:30.807]  deserve this?
[00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:37.117]   We're talking about Middle school kids that are maybe just learning about this
[00:53:37.117 --> 00:53:42.708]   part of American history Probably can't even really properly understand it, but oh
[00:53:42.708 --> 00:53:45.847]   they're gonna. They're gonna really make this country racist again
[00:53:45.906 --> 00:53:46.847]  That's the Democrat Party.
[00:53:47.027 --> 00:53:52.211]  The same Democrat Party of Bull Connor that stood in the way of schoolhouse doors with whips.
[00:53:52.591 --> 00:53:55.373]  So if a black person tried to go in, that Democrat would whip them.
[00:53:55.954 --> 00:53:57.395]  That's the Democrat Party, baby.
[00:53:57.415 --> 00:53:59.797]  That's the party of slavery.
[00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:02.451]  Oh, but they want you to forget about that.
[00:54:03.092 --> 00:54:10.238]  They always complain like, oh, Jefferson Davis, you know, let's remove Jefferson Davis from school buildings and streets and statues.
[00:54:10.479 --> 00:54:12.340]  Jefferson Davis was a Democrat.
[00:54:13.001 --> 00:54:15.563]  But I digress from that, so we'll have that coming up.
[00:54:16.584 --> 00:54:21.268]  And then, what is going on in Chicago?
[00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:26.333]  Lori Lightfoot in Chicago is a cartoon character.
[00:54:27.708 --> 00:54:32.270]  I mean, you thought this Beetlejuice clone had reached full levels of insanity?
[00:54:33.130 --> 00:54:33.711]  Not quite.
[00:54:34.671 --> 00:54:37.432]  Beetlejuice Lightfoot is getting more insane as the days go on.
[00:54:37.452 --> 00:54:40.334]  So, all that and more coming up.
[00:54:40.414 --> 00:54:46.396]  I'm going to just really become a news reading machine on the other side of this break.
[00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:48.697]  Yeah, there's your new Lori Lightfoot that just dropped.
[00:54:48.757 --> 00:54:49.658]  Look at that drip.
[00:54:50.558 --> 00:54:51.539]  Oh my God.
[00:54:52.039 --> 00:55:02.966]   But aside from her looking like Beetlejuice and dressing like a goon, She's threatening, she's threatening workers in Chicago that won't get a vaccine.
[00:55:02.986 --> 00:55:07.248]  And she says, oh, we're not firing people that won't get a vaccine.
[00:55:07.588 --> 00:55:09.910]  We're just going to make sure you can't get a paycheck.
[00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:11.510]  Oh, OK.
[00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:13.051]  Yeah, sure you are.
[00:55:13.531 --> 00:55:15.092]  We're not here to murder you.
[00:55:15.452 --> 00:55:18.514]  We're just going to stab you in the neck until you bleed to death.
[00:55:21.687 --> 00:55:22.667]  So all that's coming up.
[00:55:22.827 --> 00:55:23.567]  But you know what?
[00:55:23.627 --> 00:55:24.668]  Let's do this real quick.
[00:55:24.728 --> 00:55:28.548]  Nancy Pelosi has interests in Ukraine with her corrupt crime family.
[00:55:28.628 --> 00:55:32.169]  She's a mafia child and she's running for office again.
[00:55:32.749 --> 00:55:50.677]   Now you tell me if this woman in clip two looks and sounds like a sane individual that has her you-know-what together or if this sounds like a deteriorating psychopath that needs to be removed from any positions of power.
[00:55:50.677 --> 00:55:55.677]   If her family cared about her, they'd probably put her in, you know, some sort of care in her own home.
[00:55:55.677 --> 00:55:58.876]   I mean, they've got enough money, they can just build a whole home for her if they needed to.
[00:55:58.876 --> 00:56:01.677]  You tell me how Nancy Pelosi sounds here in Clip 2.
[00:56:01.677 --> 00:56:04.677]  But they know that we can't go there.
[00:56:04.677 --> 00:56:15.677]   Putin is trying to bait the trap so that we go in, and that's the beginning, could be the beginning of World War III.
[00:56:16.177 --> 00:56:22.177]   Putin, totally irresponsible, using weapons that are not allowed under the Geneva Convention.
[00:56:22.177 --> 00:56:26.177]  Putin, who threatens use of chemical weapons.
[00:56:27.071 --> 00:56:59.286]   Nuclear and the rest so they know that we can't but it's the ask now He was this morning More let's if we can't have an if we can't have a no-fly zone Let us have our own and we need the airplanes to come in No, no, no, no this morning he was less on the on the ask for the That policy more on let us do it, help us get the planes.
[00:56:59.566 --> 00:57:06.749]  But also there is a school of thought that thinks the anti-aircraft missiles and the rest are a very important way.
[00:57:07.229 --> 00:57:15.452]  Myself, when I see that those tanks, that 40 miles of tanks, I'd like to take out those tanks.
[00:57:15.512 --> 00:57:23.935]  I mean, I think that them having more planes might be useful, but that I'm not a military strategist.
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:38.149]  We hope that we will be able to get up to a place, I hope, you asked me how, I hope that we can get to a place where the MiGs, which are the kinds of planes they've been trained on, can go to Ukraine.
[00:57:40.070 --> 00:57:45.174]  The F-16s, especially if we have an excess of them, can backfill for Poland.
[00:57:46.471 --> 00:57:51.693]  Nancy Pelosi, the poster child for term limits and I guess what alcohol abuse does too.
[00:57:51.713 --> 00:58:03.196]  Alright, I want to mention a couple things and we're going to change lanes quickly and just cover some other news and then get back into the conflict in Ukraine with Sean Stone coming into studio to discuss this.
[00:58:04.116 --> 00:58:09.538]  But a couple things that need to be mentioned at least here today and they won't get the full focus but they need to be mentioned.
[00:58:10.936 --> 00:58:13.097]  You do have a trucker convoy in D.C.
[00:58:13.137 --> 00:58:18.620]  that's getting bigger and basically for a couple hours a day they just drive the D.C.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:31.046]  beltway and they've caused a bunch of traffic and some locals are complaining but again I'm not trying to sound sliding or disrespectful to the convoy in D.C.
[00:58:31.106 --> 00:58:43.832]   right now that is not my intention I'm just telling you the reason why it's not getting much coverage and not press is because To me, the demands that they've listed have not really been that hardcore or publicly made.
[00:58:44.914 --> 00:58:54.788]  Obviously, there's a blackout on the news coverage and the leaders of it have been doing everything possible to cooperate with law enforcement, I guess to avoid a similar situation.
[00:58:55.308 --> 00:59:01.072]  That is what happened in Canada with people getting their bank accounts removed and people getting arrested and disappeared and everything.
[00:59:01.872 --> 00:59:07.496]  Not to mention with the current Democrat party in power already with hundreds of political prisoners being tortured.
[00:59:07.616 --> 00:59:08.817]  So, I understand that.
[00:59:09.981 --> 00:59:12.824]  Um, but it's worth mentioning there is a trucker convoy.
[00:59:12.844 --> 00:59:14.166]  It is happening in D.C.
[00:59:14.206 --> 00:59:16.789]  for about four or five hours a day, clogging up the D.C.
[00:59:16.809 --> 00:59:19.332]  Beltway, and that's kind of the status there.
[00:59:20.093 --> 00:59:28.702]  There's also another convoy in Canada that's going on right now that is actually starting to get a little more headway and a little more news coverage.
[00:59:29.744 --> 00:59:31.225]  And it's the same story.
[00:59:32.206 --> 00:59:42.474]  They want to get rid of the vaccine mandates, get rid of all the lockdowns and mask mandates, and they've actually moved into British Columbia now, so it's not centered in Ottawa as much.
[00:59:43.335 --> 00:59:50.381]  So a continuation of the Canadian Freedom Convoy is happening in Canada.
[00:59:50.461 --> 00:59:58.127]  So those are two developing stories we're not going to focus on today, but it's worth you knowing that those things are happening.
[00:59:59.392 --> 01:00:03.535]  Also, and you know, maybe we should focus more on this.
[01:00:04.476 --> 01:00:05.897]  It's not my intention today.
[01:00:05.917 --> 01:00:07.658]  I don't have a big stack of news on this.
[01:00:07.738 --> 01:00:08.699]  I could if I wanted to.
[01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:20.388]  There is a all-out war going on at the southern border with the Mexican cartels and in some cases border patrol agents.
[01:00:21.718 --> 01:00:29.621]  They're finding stash houses of young little girls at the southern border, stash houses of young little girls being trafficked into sex.
[01:00:31.562 --> 01:00:37.844]  They're finding at certain parts of the border, I mean folks, it's the same old stuff.
[01:00:37.985 --> 01:00:48.649]  Evidence of drug abuse, evidence of child sex trafficking, evidence of sex trafficking, evidence of human trafficking, evidence of just illegal immigration.
[01:00:50.137 --> 01:00:53.159]  And then the cartels are down there doing God knows what.
[01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:55.201]  Dead bodies being found everywhere.
[01:00:55.541 --> 01:00:59.384]  Whole buildings just being burnt to the ground overnight.
[01:00:59.424 --> 01:01:01.525]  The cartels running around shooting guns in the air.
[01:01:01.846 --> 01:01:03.587]  So I mean it's like, it's wild.
[01:01:05.168 --> 01:01:06.389]  It is wild.
[01:01:09.136 --> 01:01:10.937]  It's not really getting any coverage at all.
[01:01:11.037 --> 01:01:14.018]  Some of the videos coming out of there are just absolutely insane.
[01:01:14.058 --> 01:01:16.359]  But again, they're finding dead children's bodies.
[01:01:16.379 --> 01:01:18.640]  I mean, folks, it is just bad.
[01:01:19.881 --> 01:01:41.845]   But meanwhile, of course, with the open southern border, you have Russians and Ukrainians joining in on the fun of crossing the southern border illegally to come into this country and get the billions of dollars that we pay for this illegal immigration to go on.
[01:01:41.925 --> 01:02:03.241]  So just know the southern border is still out of control and maybe even worse than it's ever been where it appears the best of my analysis is that there's now turf wars happening between cartel groups and maybe even like corrupt members of the Mexican Border Patrol or the U.S.
[01:02:03.282 --> 01:02:03.802]  Border Patrol.
[01:02:04.743 --> 01:02:05.944]  I'm not trying to be disrespectful.
[01:02:05.964 --> 01:02:06.644]  I think they're good people.
[01:02:06.804 --> 01:02:12.429]   I'm just saying I mean, it looks like there's like full-on turf wars going on at the southern border.
[01:02:14.171 --> 01:02:23.639]  And there's dead bodies piling up, and there's human sex operations getting busted, and there's just massive fires and complexes burning down.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:29.864]  So, you know, that might be a bigger threat to us than what's going on in Ukraine.
[01:02:30.505 --> 01:02:36.804]   That is, except for the fact that we've got our corrupt politicians like Biden and Pelosi and Romney and others
[01:02:36.804 --> 01:02:40.664]   that have their interests in Ukraine, so we have to get dragged into that conflict.
[01:02:40.664 --> 01:02:41.164]  Now...
[01:02:41.164 --> 01:02:49.064]   Yeah, folks, I'm telling you, it's just wild, the crew pulling up some of these headlines.
[01:02:49.148 --> 01:02:50.910]  Mexican cartel gunman attacks U.S.
[01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:52.372]  Consulate building near Texas.
[01:02:53.132 --> 01:02:56.376]  It's getting wild down there, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:57.276 --> 01:03:01.100]  It is getting wild down there.
[01:03:02.962 --> 01:03:07.467]  Let's do this, and I'm going to come back and get into some of this latest vaccine news and stuff.
[01:03:08.749 --> 01:03:12.051]  But here's another example on Fox News.
[01:03:12.071 --> 01:03:19.914]  Here's Rachel Campos-Duffy, who's just trying to be neutral on the Ukraine-Russia situation and not go along with the Fox talking points.
[01:03:20.214 --> 01:03:31.678]   And there's Brian Kilmeade, who, look, Brian Kilmeade says some good stuff every once in a while, but I'm a media Call me a media critic, really I'm like addicted to media.
[01:03:31.758 --> 01:03:33.018]  I see Brian Kilmeade all the time.
[01:03:33.298 --> 01:03:36.160]  He's a neocon, he's a conservative establishment hack.
[01:03:36.961 --> 01:03:39.162]  He'll do what he's told if he's told to bark or sit.
[01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:50.508]  And so listen, as Rachel can't bust up, he tries to be neutral on the Ukraine-Russia situation, and there's neocon Brian Kilmeade shaking his head trying to cut her off like he wants to be the next Sean Hannity Warhawk.
[01:03:50.748 --> 01:03:54.931]  I wonder how much money he has invested in these weapons manufacturer stocks.
[01:03:55.471 --> 01:03:57.212]  But here it is on Fox News just last night.
[01:03:58.049 --> 01:03:58.369]  I don't know.
[01:03:58.489 --> 01:04:03.253]  If you look at that map and the areas that they have that you say could end up in this peace agreement, that's true.
[01:04:03.373 --> 01:04:05.195]  And that's why we should have never provoked them.
[01:04:05.255 --> 01:04:07.576]  I mean, they made very clear that there was a red line.
[01:04:07.917 --> 01:04:12.260]  The red line was a neutrality for Ukraine, that they could not enter NATO.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:20.026]  And in the end, when they get this, if they get this peace agreement, in the end, that's probably going to end up being the case anyway.
[01:04:20.527 --> 01:04:27.312]  I bet you that one of the conditions will have to be that Ukraine, you know, promised to remain neutral, will not be part of NATO.
[01:04:27.432 --> 01:04:31.757]  Well, I'll tell you what, you can never give in to what Russia wants other nations to do.
[01:04:33.258 --> 01:04:38.844]  They're going to decide to go into NATO, go into the European Union, when they're a European society that wants that?
[01:04:39.024 --> 01:04:45.391]  Well, we have a Monroe Doctrine, and I think we would be very concerned about this kind of action in our hemisphere.
[01:04:45.411 --> 01:04:53.177]   I think he said, keep it neutral, and in the end, Probably Ukraine is going to lose more land because of this.
[01:04:53.617 --> 01:05:00.898]  Again, the main problem here, as you see, and as we discussed, well, no actually the main problem is still China.
[01:05:01.438 --> 01:05:03.479]  And now we've created a bigger block.
[01:05:03.779 --> 01:05:05.219]  China and Russia together.
[01:05:05.439 --> 01:05:08.700]  This is why our policy makers aren't thinking long term.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:12.801]  Provoking this war has brought our two enemies closer together.
[01:05:12.821 --> 01:05:13.701]  We did not provoke the war.
[01:05:13.721 --> 01:05:14.341]  They provoked the war.
[01:05:15.081 --> 01:05:19.545]  Well, they had a redline and we had an agreement in November with a security agreement.
[01:05:19.565 --> 01:05:21.147]  You can't make a redline in other countries, Rachel.
[01:05:21.247 --> 01:05:23.689]  It's not up to them to make a redline.
[01:05:23.729 --> 01:05:24.350]  That's good.
[01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:34.039]  So here's what I'm just saying here, is that I watch 10-12 hours media, listen, talk radio, read news stories every day.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.561]  I don't forget this stuff.
[01:05:37.422 --> 01:05:38.623]  Brian Kilmeade is a hack.
[01:05:39.551 --> 01:05:41.272]  Brian Kilmeade told you Trump would never win.
[01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:42.353]  He bashed Trump for years.
[01:05:42.733 --> 01:05:47.315]  Brian Kilmeade makes millions of dollars with a Fox News talk radio show and going on Fox News.
[01:05:47.655 --> 01:05:49.256]  He's a conservative neocon hack.
[01:05:50.537 --> 01:05:51.177]  He's a goblin.
[01:05:51.578 --> 01:05:52.318]  And you know what?
[01:05:52.438 --> 01:05:53.599]  I'm sad that that's the case.
[01:05:53.719 --> 01:05:55.180]  I want Brian Kilmeade to be a good person.
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:59.322]  But you see, he's got to parrot the Fox News neocon talking points.
[01:05:59.642 --> 01:06:00.623]  Putin the bad guy.
[01:06:01.616 --> 01:06:07.661]  Putin the bad guy, Ukraine the good guy, and all Rachel Duffy is saying is the truth there.
[01:06:07.861 --> 01:06:21.452]  It's all she's saying is the truth, but you see the two neocon plants there on Fox News can't let her finish the statement without keeping up the narrative that, oh, it's all Putin, it's all Russia, we need to save Ukraine no matter how many other people die in this war.
[01:06:22.292 --> 01:06:28.878]  Let's not forget about the current global operation, medical tyranny, medical industrial complex.
[01:06:30.563 --> 01:06:39.527]  World government depopulation agenda that was the root of the COVID-19 outbreak and then the vaccines that followed.
[01:06:39.687 --> 01:06:43.008]  So let's cover the latest on that situation.
[01:06:43.068 --> 01:06:48.031]  You have millions now going into lockdown in China again.
[01:06:49.592 --> 01:06:52.751]  I've seen numbers from 17 million to 30 million and more.
[01:06:52.751 --> 01:06:58.610]   So I mean, who knows the actual numbers, but Foxconn has halted iPhone production at factories
[01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:01.392]  in Shenzhen due to lockdown.
[01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:03.992]  So you've got big lockdowns happening again in China.
[01:07:03.992 --> 01:07:12.352]   They were at, like, they were averaging 50 to 100 COVID cases a day for like a year,
[01:07:12.352 --> 01:07:16.951]   and then all of a sudden overnight it was 50,000 cases in one day.
[01:07:16.951 --> 01:07:19.072]  So something's going on in China.
[01:07:19.072 --> 01:07:24.552]   The lockdowns are back, and if we're operating on the same timetable as COVID,
[01:07:24.552 --> 01:07:31.552]   that means they would be reintroducing these lockdowns in about three months in America.
[01:07:31.552 --> 01:07:38.112]   However, I think the Democrats are gonna do everything they can to try to avoid that
[01:07:38.112 --> 01:07:43.631]   until after the midterm elections, when either it'll be a dead duck party
[01:07:43.631 --> 01:07:51.512]   because they lose Congress, or they'll be more empowered and charged than ever
[01:07:51.512 --> 01:07:53.412]  to destroy the American way of life.
[01:07:54.011 --> 01:07:55.892]  And they'll really clamp down with the lockdowns.
[01:07:56.012 --> 01:08:03.115]  Either way, I would expect it after the midterms, but the timetable might be moving too quickly for them, and so we'll see what they have to do.
[01:08:03.495 --> 01:08:07.937]  And it could be the same thing we saw with, oh, the Democrats now want to fund the police!
[01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:13.339]  Oh, yes, we forgot for five years you chanted defund the police and actually did defund the police in many of these cities.
[01:08:13.559 --> 01:08:15.279]  They're having record crime outbreaks.
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.861]  But, oh, and just think about this, too.
[01:08:21.804 --> 01:08:26.666]  You saw record crime in the year 2021.
[01:08:27.707 --> 01:08:35.871]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're not even a quarter of the way through the year 2022, and we're already on pace to shatter the record crime we saw last year.
[01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:41.653]  So, I mean, it's getting real bad in these Democrat-run cities, folks.
[01:08:41.813 --> 01:08:43.334]  I mean, real bad.
[01:08:43.934 --> 01:08:49.277]  I mean, New York, San Francisco, D.C., Chicago, yeesh!
[01:08:52.608 --> 01:08:53.128]  Moving on.
[01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:58.971]  Los Angeles Teachers Union forcing students to keep wearing masks even though the mandate is over.
[01:08:59.011 --> 01:09:01.012]  They will never stop torturing your kids.
[01:09:01.132 --> 01:09:02.472]  They love it.
[01:09:03.493 --> 01:09:05.573]  Breathe in your own carbon emissions.
[01:09:05.914 --> 01:09:07.234]  Just die.
[01:09:08.074 --> 01:09:09.915]  Wear that face muzzle forever.
[01:09:09.995 --> 01:09:11.636]  I mean, these people are such a joke, man.
[01:09:12.296 --> 01:09:14.157]  They really will never take off their mask.
[01:09:14.197 --> 01:09:16.118]  And I love this piece of art.
[01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:28.021]   And it's a woman in a mask, and the mask says, I'm just not ready to accept that everything I believed was a lie.
[01:09:29.463 --> 01:09:33.529]  Well, will you ever be ready to accept that, or will you live the lie forever?
[01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:37.715]  I guess that is the choice they have to make.
[01:09:39.545 --> 01:09:44.287]  It's easier to fool a man than for a man to admit he was fooled.
[01:09:44.887 --> 01:09:54.451]  And that's what you're seeing right now with these libs walking around with their face masks for the rest of their lives, taking 5, 6, 7 vaccines till they die.
[01:09:55.611 --> 01:09:56.531]  Really a sad thing.
[01:09:57.932 --> 01:10:05.935]  Thailand pays out $45 million to 16,000 people following COVID-19 adverse reactions.
[01:10:06.475 --> 01:10:07.956]  Ah, safe and effective, they said.
[01:10:08.076 --> 01:10:08.816]  Safe and effective.
[01:10:10.051 --> 01:10:11.352]  More tricks from the CDC.
[01:10:11.412 --> 01:10:18.157]  Child flu deaths continue to mysteriously disappear in 2021 so they could ramp up COVID death numbers and abuse children.
[01:10:18.658 --> 01:10:23.181]  Yeah, the flu disappeared.
[01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:24.562]  There is no flu anymore.
[01:10:24.662 --> 01:10:25.403]  It's all COVID.
[01:10:25.963 --> 01:10:47.602]   And I forget, it was some mainstream leftist publication that had the headline recently, did the PCR tests Give us false COVID numbers that inflated the fear and the pandemic and it's like, Whoa, you just figured that one out, huh?
[01:10:47.742 --> 01:10:48.382]  Wow.
[01:10:48.442 --> 01:10:50.343]  You guys are really slow.
[01:10:51.123 --> 01:10:53.585]  It'd be like if you were running a race.
[01:10:56.699 --> 01:11:06.806]  And everybody finishes up the race, and it's post-race, and there's an award ceremony, or you know, people are having lunch or whatever, and then somebody finishes the race and you're like, whoa, you were still out there running?
[01:11:07.987 --> 01:11:09.608]  We finished hours ago, you just finished?
[01:11:09.628 --> 01:11:10.189]  Where have you been?
[01:11:11.029 --> 01:11:14.111]  That seems to be the left on every issue these days.
[01:11:15.553 --> 01:11:17.434]  Top doctor at Vancouver Coastal Health.
[01:11:19.068 --> 01:11:28.695]  Says COVID-19 vaccine is not effective at preventing infection or transmission of any of the variants, and it's time to just drop all COVID restrictions altogether.
[01:11:28.916 --> 01:11:31.758]  By the way, Pfizer's admitting that too, but we'll have that in a second.
[01:11:32.879 --> 01:11:35.981]  Here's the side effects they want to act like don't exist, even though they're all public now.
[01:11:36.701 --> 01:11:38.903]  Stroke rates are increasing among young people.
[01:11:39.804 --> 01:11:40.704]  That's NPR.
[01:11:41.545 --> 01:11:43.747]  Stroke rates are increasing among young people.
[01:11:43.887 --> 01:11:46.529]  What is the controlled variable?
[01:11:48.001 --> 01:11:54.145]  What is the controlled variable on the entire population if you were to say, four years ago compared to now?
[01:11:54.186 --> 01:11:55.687]  Well, it would be the vaccine.
[01:11:57.128 --> 01:12:00.730]  Why are you seeing young people having strokes and blood clots and heart attacks?
[01:12:01.771 --> 01:12:02.131]  I don't know.
[01:12:02.211 --> 01:12:04.433]  What's the difference between now and four years ago?
[01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:08.076]  Well, they're all getting this experimental injection.
[01:12:08.735 --> 01:12:10.735]  But you're shhhhhh.
[01:12:10.735 --> 01:12:12.735]  Shhhhhhhhh.
[01:12:12.735 --> 01:12:14.735]  Shhhhhhhhh.
[01:12:14.735 --> 01:12:16.735]  Shhhhhhhhh.
[01:12:16.735 --> 01:12:18.735]  That's what NPR is really saying.
[01:12:19.246 --> 01:12:19.686]  Shh!
[01:12:20.186 --> 01:12:21.627]  The vaccines are causing strokes.
[01:12:22.048 --> 01:12:22.508]  Shh!
[01:12:22.768 --> 01:12:23.489]  Don't tell anyone.
[01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:26.851]  We promoted it, and we didn't say the side effects.
[01:12:26.892 --> 01:12:29.594]  We probably need to go to jail for that, but shh, shh, shh.
[01:12:31.755 --> 01:12:38.040]  Number two, female golfer Kelly, or Nelly Korda, undergoing treatment for blood clot.
[01:12:40.222 --> 01:12:42.504]  What is she, like, 30 years old or less?
[01:12:44.445 --> 01:12:45.126]  Great athlete.
[01:12:45.446 --> 01:12:46.006]  Good shape.
[01:12:46.607 --> 01:12:47.187]  Blood clot.
[01:12:48.328 --> 01:12:55.013]  And hey, I don't want to sit here and think this is all from the vaccine, but it's odd how this is all happening all of a sudden.
[01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:58.115]  Just a coincidence, I'm sure.
[01:12:58.676 --> 01:13:02.238]  Knoxville teacher and basketball coach dies suddenly.
[01:13:02.439 --> 01:13:03.099]  Dies suddenly.
[01:13:03.119 --> 01:13:04.120]  28 years old.
[01:13:05.481 --> 01:13:07.222]  Dies suddenly.
[01:13:11.145 --> 01:13:19.988]   Dies suddenly is now a Top search term on Google because of stories like these.
[01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:25.149]  And they never want to tell you what's going on.
[01:13:25.229 --> 01:13:26.930]  They all want to cover it up.
[01:13:28.410 --> 01:13:32.332]  And again, do we know for sure this is from a vaccine?
[01:13:34.092 --> 01:13:39.834]  We may never know because they're not doing a proper investigation or honest coverage of this stuff.
[01:13:41.343 --> 01:13:42.663]  But it's another die suddenly.
[01:13:42.703 --> 01:13:44.024]  It's another young person with a stroke.
[01:13:44.064 --> 01:13:45.604]  It's another young person with a heart attack.
[01:13:46.504 --> 01:13:49.925]  And by the way, I'm seeing accounts like this all the time now.
[01:13:50.505 --> 01:13:52.005]  People saying, I got the vaccine.
[01:13:52.045 --> 01:13:52.705]  I got two.
[01:13:53.826 --> 01:13:54.986]  I was told how great it was.
[01:13:55.046 --> 01:13:56.286]  I used to be an extreme athlete.
[01:13:56.326 --> 01:13:57.326]  I used to be a mountain biker.
[01:13:57.366 --> 01:13:58.447]  I used to be a mountain climber.
[01:13:58.507 --> 01:13:59.547]  I used to be a tennis player.
[01:13:59.587 --> 01:14:01.687]  I used to be a CrossFit athlete.
[01:14:01.747 --> 01:14:06.428]  And now I can't do anything because I'm constantly undergoing treatments for vaccine side effects.
[01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:07.849]  But here's Anthony Fauci.
[01:14:07.869 --> 01:14:09.549]  He says more vaccines are the answer.
[01:14:10.595 --> 01:14:11.836]  And we'll never be out of this.
[01:14:12.416 --> 01:14:14.098]  That's called medical tyranny.
[01:14:14.138 --> 01:14:15.359]  That's called fascism.
[01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:18.421]  That's called you've-been-conquered-by-the-medical-industrial-complex.
[01:14:18.961 --> 01:14:21.223]  And Anthony Fauci promoting the death clot shot.
[01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:29.829]  Pfizer CEO pushes fourth booster in live interview with Face the Nation while admitting it doesn't stop infection.
[01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:31.270]  Isn't that fun?
[01:14:32.371 --> 01:14:35.253]  Oh yeah, this doesn't stop infection, but you should get four, five, six.
[01:14:35.273 --> 01:14:35.994]  You should take them forever.
[01:14:37.017 --> 01:14:42.039]  Meanwhile, Kyrie Irving, who's been fighting back against these mandates, this is how insane it is in New York.
[01:14:42.399 --> 01:14:52.803]  Kyrie Irving is not allowed to play basketball for the Brooklyn Nets because he hasn't taken a vaccine.
[01:14:52.863 --> 01:15:00.006]  So he's not allowed to even go and be a part of the team activities when they're playing in Brooklyn.
[01:15:00.306 --> 01:15:01.387]  But you know what he can do?
[01:15:01.947 --> 01:15:10.880]   He can purchase a ticket and attend the ballgame Without being vaccinated and without a mask, but he can't play in the game.
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:22.347]  So, as a troll, he bought tickets, well, I guess technically it's his family season tickets, and he went and sat in his season tickets, but he can't play in the game.
[01:15:22.627 --> 01:15:23.768]  Total clown world.
[01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:32.194]  Now see, I'll have to come back to this, but folks, they're saying, oh, look at all these side effects from COVID, you know.
[01:15:33.297 --> 01:15:39.503]  Brain damage, lung damage, tissue damage, weakness, sex drive damage, all this stuff, and they say, oh, the vaccine's the answer.
[01:15:39.883 --> 01:15:43.266]  Why aren't we mad at the people that made this virus?
[01:15:43.987 --> 01:15:45.948]  That's where the attention should be.
[01:15:46.028 --> 01:15:48.010]  Who made this deadly virus?
[01:15:48.551 --> 01:16:00.161]  All right, we're about to be joined in the next hour by Sean Stone in studio to talk about the relevance now, even more relevant than ever, his father's documentary, Ukraine on Fire.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:12.764]  And then also on the war room, we're going to be joined by an individual who is stationed in Ukraine covering the events, who wants to give us a first-hand account of what he sees.
[01:16:14.065 --> 01:16:21.168]  Before we do that, let me kind of prime this with the latest news and headlines from Ukraine here.
[01:16:21.509 --> 01:16:24.270]  So, you saw the UN head warning.
[01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:27.672]  It's bone-chilling, the possibility of now a nuclear conflict.
[01:16:28.652 --> 01:16:30.273]  And here's how I kind of see this going.
[01:16:31.514 --> 01:16:48.305]   Because You have to kind of psychoanalyze the people involved and then, if possible, and it's a challenge maybe not too many can do, but if possible, try to put yourself into their mindset to understand what they're thinking, where they're coming from.
[01:16:50.248 --> 01:16:53.832]  The globalists don't want to inherit a poisoned planet.
[01:16:54.966 --> 01:17:01.571]  And so really the thought and concept of nuclear war has basically just been a gun they've held to the people's heads.
[01:17:02.072 --> 01:17:03.933]  I don't think they actually want nuclear war.
[01:17:04.454 --> 01:17:15.523]  Now, I understand you could retort that and say, well, why do they do hundreds if not thousands of nuclear weapons tests around the planet if that's the case?
[01:17:15.583 --> 01:17:18.145]  Well, they don't do that in their backyard.
[01:17:18.205 --> 01:17:21.728]  They don't do that in the areas that they plan on conquering.
[01:17:23.089 --> 01:17:29.265]   But nonetheless, If they wanted to wipe out a billion people, they wouldn't do it with a nuke.
[01:17:29.705 --> 01:17:34.247]  They would do it with a bioweapon, like a virus or a vaccine.
[01:17:35.907 --> 01:17:44.931]  And so that's why the bioweapons labs in Ukraine is such an important story, and that's why I think the Chinese and the Russians now are calling it out.
[01:17:45.431 --> 01:17:48.593]  Granted, you can sit here and say, hey, well, what about Chinese biolabs?
[01:17:49.093 --> 01:17:58.826]   Okay, perfectly fair contradictory stance to call out there from China, But it's them working with Western interests to do it anyway.
[01:17:59.286 --> 01:18:00.888]  And the obvious question should be this.
[01:18:02.269 --> 01:18:08.594]  Why in the hell does the US have biological labs in Ukraine?
[01:18:08.674 --> 01:18:10.236]  Why would we be doing that in Ukraine?
[01:18:11.337 --> 01:18:13.118]  Why would we be doing that on Russia's doorstep?
[01:18:14.479 --> 01:18:19.423]  Well, it's a complex answer, but the simple answer is because it's illegal here!
[01:18:20.524 --> 01:18:22.146]  You can't do that research here!
[01:18:22.366 --> 01:18:23.067]  That's illegal!
[01:18:24.252 --> 01:18:40.276]  And it was Barack Obama that spearheaded it in 2005 and 2014 to take all the illegal biological research and station it in Ukraine and station it in China, which is on Russia's front porch and back porch.
[01:18:42.776 --> 01:18:50.578]  You combine that with the NATO gun being pointed at Russia's head for the last couple of decades, now you see why Putin has run out of patience.
[01:18:51.058 --> 01:18:54.210]   But see, They don't want nuclear war.
[01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:57.431]  They'd rather kill off billions of people with a biological weapon.
[01:18:58.171 --> 01:19:00.192]  And I don't think Putin is on board with that.
[01:19:00.952 --> 01:19:05.373]  That's why he's moving in through Ukraine to get NATO off of his front porch.
[01:19:05.953 --> 01:19:11.235]  That's why he's moving in on these bio labs so that they can't be released on the planet.
[01:19:12.775 --> 01:19:27.723]   And oh, but you're not allowed to say that because the globalist interest in Ukraine and the globalist interest of eugenists on this planet cannot have any truth about Putin coming out.
[01:19:28.343 --> 01:19:31.064]  Putin can be the most evil dictator in the world.
[01:19:32.345 --> 01:19:39.048]  If he says we don't want biological labs in our front yard, we're going to report on it.
[01:19:39.168 --> 01:19:47.271]  I don't care how many times Mitt Romney or The View or these hosts on CNN and MSNBC say we have to be arrested for our free speech.
[01:19:49.025 --> 01:19:53.627]  Now, an interesting development, and I'm going to save this for Sean Stone.
[01:19:54.067 --> 01:20:02.690]  There was a woman, who I think is in court today or tomorrow, who went on a Russian TV broadcast and had a no war sign.
[01:20:05.932 --> 01:20:14.215]  My first instinct was this is straight up propaganda and she's some sort of agent, and there's more evidence pouring in that that's the case.
[01:20:15.165 --> 01:20:16.566]  But let me just put that on hold.
[01:20:16.606 --> 01:20:17.807]  We'll get into that with Sean Stone.
[01:20:17.827 --> 01:20:18.807]  I'd like his take on that.
[01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:19.948]  Here's some of the other headlines.
[01:20:21.329 --> 01:20:24.691]  Zelensky has now made a statement saying Ukraine won't join NATO.
[01:20:24.811 --> 01:20:26.833]  Will that lower the temperature in the region?
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:31.862]  Ukrainian President Zelensky will also be addressing U.S.
[01:20:31.942 --> 01:20:33.523]  Congress tomorrow morning.
[01:20:33.984 --> 01:20:35.304]  So that's going to be big.
[01:20:35.364 --> 01:20:37.266]  Is this going to be him begging and pleading?
[01:20:37.746 --> 01:20:41.488]  Or is this going to be him saying, please stop, you're making things worse?
[01:20:42.289 --> 01:20:43.469]  That's coming up tomorrow.
[01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:46.251]  Russia has now sanctioned the U.S.
[01:20:46.872 --> 01:20:48.012]  in a turn of events.
[01:20:48.332 --> 01:20:48.893]  And you know what?
[01:20:49.593 --> 01:21:02.034]   It's the corrupt leaders of our country Joe Biden, Tony Blinken, Lloyd Austin, other administration officials, and I believe there might even be a little Clinton action in there as well.
[01:21:02.074 --> 01:21:10.076]  Yes, Hillary Clinton too, Jen Psaki, Jake Sullivan, the CIA director, Mark Milley.
[01:21:13.152 --> 01:21:14.953]  I can hate Putin or I can love Putin.
[01:21:15.574 --> 01:21:21.677]  Putin is not even in the top 100 when it comes to enemies of America.
[01:21:21.777 --> 01:21:25.880]  Putin is not even in the top 100 when it comes to threats to America's sovereignty.
[01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:26.740]  He's not.
[01:21:27.121 --> 01:21:33.405]  That's a fictional tale that you're being told by our corrupt media and politicians.
[01:21:33.865 --> 01:21:35.526]  You know who's a much bigger threat?
[01:21:35.606 --> 01:21:36.426]  Hillary Clinton.
[01:21:36.667 --> 01:21:37.827]  You know who's a much bigger threat?
[01:21:37.907 --> 01:21:38.708]  Joe Biden.
[01:21:39.048 --> 01:21:39.909]  Jen Psaki.
[01:21:40.949 --> 01:21:43.050]  Tony Blinken, and the list goes on.
[01:21:43.110 --> 01:21:46.411]  So, now Putin has sanctioned all those people.
[01:21:46.751 --> 01:21:58.095]  So, again, I could hate Putin, I could say Putin's the biggest dictator, worst warmonger on the planet, but boy, he seems to be going after the worst Americans.
[01:21:58.135 --> 01:22:01.956]  He's going after the most corrupt elements of the American political regime.
[01:22:02.596 --> 01:22:06.998]  So, at the very least, I would scratch my head and say, well, that's an interesting development.
[01:22:08.703 --> 01:22:14.028]  If you had a list of 100 people that are the biggest threat to America, Putin just sanctioned 15 of them.
[01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:17.251]  And he's not even cracking the top 100.
[01:22:20.114 --> 01:22:21.675]  So, what does that really mean?
[01:22:21.815 --> 01:22:24.017]  Probably just more symbolic than anything else.
[01:22:24.257 --> 01:22:26.920]  I don't think it's going to matter or anything's going to happen to them.
[01:22:27.961 --> 01:22:29.562]  But what if Putin came in here?
[01:22:29.782 --> 01:22:34.327]  What if Putin invaded America and said, I'm coming in to arrest the Bidens and the Clintons?
[01:22:36.557 --> 01:22:39.918]  In a way, that's kind of what he did in Ukraine, folks, but moving on.
[01:22:41.239 --> 01:22:45.680]  Biden advisor warns China will face consequences if it helps Russia evade sanctions.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:46.900]  Jake Sullivan.
[01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:47.520]  Let me tell you something.
[01:22:47.941 --> 01:22:56.723]  This sniveling weasel, this sniveling dweeb, Jake Sullivan, is an embarrassment.
[01:22:58.144 --> 01:23:01.805]  The Chinese delegation laughed Jake Sullivan out of the room.
[01:23:03.516 --> 01:23:07.177]  So, a nothing, a nitwit, a zero, a ratfink.
[01:23:07.857 --> 01:23:13.138]  Jake Sullivan, after failing in negotiations with China, just way over his head.
[01:23:13.158 --> 01:23:22.741]  I mean, that's like taking a ten-year-old peewee football player and telling him to go play quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams.
[01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:23.961]  I mean, that's a joke.
[01:23:24.021 --> 01:23:26.481]  He's going to get sacked, he's going to fumble, you're going to lose the game.
[01:23:26.781 --> 01:23:31.863]  That's the equivalent of sending Jake Sullivan to go have diplomatic conversations with China.
[01:23:32.163 --> 01:23:32.863]  They laugh.
[01:23:35.046 --> 01:23:49.694]  So now, so Jake Sullivan is, to add to his stupidity, he comes back home and he says, China better cooperate or it will face consequences further pushing China into Russia's arms.
[01:23:52.135 --> 01:23:52.415]  What.
[01:23:53.436 --> 01:23:54.636]  A. Fool.
[01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:59.259]  Jake Sullivan is a bigger threat to this country than Vladimir Putin.
[01:23:59.759 --> 01:24:01.280]  And he's now been sanctioned by Putin.
[01:24:02.324 --> 01:24:09.871]  Yeah, you think that's smart after you've embarrassed yourself in diplomatic negotiations with China to then come back and threaten China?
[01:24:11.372 --> 01:24:13.494]  What an idiot!
[01:24:16.016 --> 01:24:20.280]  Saudi Arabia invites China's Xi to visit kingdom amid strained U.S.
[01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:20.720]  relations.
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:21.701]  Good job, Sullivan!
[01:24:22.682 --> 01:24:24.003]  Oh, and what are they discussing?
[01:24:26.803 --> 01:24:29.964]  Purchasing oil without the U.S.
[01:24:30.004 --> 01:24:31.725]  dollar, but with the Chinese yuan.
[01:24:31.965 --> 01:24:33.325]  Good job, Jake Sullivan!
[01:24:33.666 --> 01:24:34.526]  Woo!
[01:24:36.106 --> 01:24:38.187]  So when you see the value of the U.S.
[01:24:38.227 --> 01:24:42.809]  dollar tank, and you see foreign nations no longer purchasing oil with the U.S.
[01:24:42.849 --> 01:24:45.530]  dollar, you can thank Jake Sullivan for that.
[01:24:45.870 --> 01:24:47.171]  Way to go, Jake Sullivan!
[01:24:47.411 --> 01:24:49.111]  Way to go, Biden administration!
[01:24:51.232 --> 01:24:53.873]  You like traveling around the world in the strength of the U.S.
[01:24:53.913 --> 01:24:54.293]  dollar?
[01:24:54.573 --> 01:24:55.294]  That's gone!
[01:24:56.448 --> 01:25:00.211]  You like the prosperity of living in America?
[01:25:00.652 --> 01:25:01.472]  That's gone!
[01:25:01.833 --> 01:25:03.554]  And you can thank Jake Sullivan for it.
[01:25:05.816 --> 01:25:07.497]  Americans can't afford gas.
[01:25:07.557 --> 01:25:09.699]  Congress just gave itself a 21% raise.
[01:25:09.719 --> 01:25:10.460]  Can you imagine that?
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:15.784]  Can you imagine the boldness of Congress to give itself a raise in these times?
[01:25:16.064 --> 01:25:17.286]  It shows you how evil they are.
[01:25:18.066 --> 01:25:21.169]  By the way, it was only a small handful of Republicans that voted against it.
[01:25:21.209 --> 01:25:23.631]  I think it was like 20-some Republicans that voted against it.
[01:25:25.936 --> 01:25:28.937]  But the rest voted to give themselves a raise now.
[01:25:30.777 --> 01:25:36.318]  Like the annual salary of a House member just went from $174,000 to $200,000.
[01:25:36.998 --> 01:25:42.779]  Do you think they deserve $200,000 a year as they crush this country?
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:26:04.289]   Alright, I'm gonna finish up with this coverage in the next short segment and then Sean Stone joins me In studio, but just know folks, Jake Sullivan just butchered international relations with China and now Congress is stealing more money from us.
[01:26:05.250 --> 01:26:09.993]  Continuing here with the latest out of Ukraine.
[01:26:11.814 --> 01:26:23.622]  I'm telling you folks, here's the problem is that the Western media and our politicians are so corrupted and they've lied about pretty much everything out of Ukraine for the last three weeks or what have you.
[01:26:25.854 --> 01:26:34.417]  And now you're starting to see some of the truth come out, and it's just been egg on the face of the Biden administration.
[01:26:34.557 --> 01:26:54.547]   From the biolabs, to the MIGs with Poland and Germany, to the sanctions not working, to the oil prices going up, and now even EU countries are saying, yeah, we're not We're not doing this anti-Russia stuff that the US is trying to do to us.
[01:26:55.007 --> 01:26:55.688]  We're not doing it.
[01:26:57.088 --> 01:26:58.228]  And it's more Trump was right.
[01:26:59.809 --> 01:27:04.350]  Boycott of Russian gas and oil could cause mass poverty in Germany.
[01:27:04.410 --> 01:27:05.991]  So Germany is saying, we're out.
[01:27:06.951 --> 01:27:09.512]  We're not getting involved in this Ukrainian conflict.
[01:27:09.532 --> 01:27:10.892]  We're not getting involved in sanctions.
[01:27:10.932 --> 01:27:11.312]  We're out.
[01:27:11.412 --> 01:27:16.994]  And that's kind of... Germany typically sets the standard for the EU.
[01:27:18.365 --> 01:27:21.166]  In response to this type of international stuff.
[01:27:22.106 --> 01:27:23.446]  So that means the EU's out.
[01:27:24.487 --> 01:27:27.207]  And you still have seen nothing from NATO.
[01:27:27.447 --> 01:27:30.068]  So I think NATO is a complete non-factor in all of this.
[01:27:30.308 --> 01:27:32.949]  Except for Putin wanting to get rid of them on his doorstep.
[01:27:34.109 --> 01:27:36.489]  So they keep saying, oh Russia's losing.
[01:27:36.569 --> 01:27:38.130]  Russia's doomed.
[01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:39.650]  Russia can't feed its troops.
[01:27:39.730 --> 01:27:41.571]  Russia can't put gas in its vehicles.
[01:27:41.651 --> 01:27:42.391]  Russia's done.
[01:27:45.032 --> 01:27:46.452]  Where's your evidence of that?
[01:27:48.339 --> 01:28:10.823]  Quite frankly, I don't really see anybody winning, except that Russia is taking the territories at once, and the sanctions aren't really doing a damn thing, and it's Western leaders and the Biden administration that has the egg on their face looking like the lying stooges that they are.
[01:28:14.223 --> 01:28:17.684]  So, it's just more egg on the face of the American media.
[01:28:19.202 --> 01:28:21.664]  And of the Biden administration.
[01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:24.907]  But so, see, you're seeing these stories come out.
[01:28:25.047 --> 01:28:26.869]  Oh, China's being devastated!
[01:28:26.969 --> 01:28:27.389]  China!
[01:28:27.850 --> 01:28:29.091]  Oh, Russia's devastated!
[01:28:29.111 --> 01:28:31.733]  $100 billion default nightmare!
[01:28:32.134 --> 01:28:37.478]  Folks, the US government is, what, $30 trillion in debt now?
[01:28:37.498 --> 01:28:38.819]  I mean, the number's just insane.
[01:28:40.161 --> 01:28:42.943]  So, all these nations are in financial ruin.
[01:28:43.984 --> 01:28:51.274]   It's mutually agreed It's like the credit bubble, the debt bubble.
[01:28:51.554 --> 01:29:05.702]  It's just so massive that all the countries have agreed, and I guess the IMF is just going to say, okay, well, everybody's just going to live in debt for the rest of eternity, or they're going to have the world great reset, which is the case.
[01:29:05.862 --> 01:29:27.834]   And so all I think Vladimir Putin is thinking is, Okay, you're going to do a Great Reset, we're going to do a Great Reset, but it's going to be the Russian Great Reset, and we're going to strategically move into Ukraine so that when we do the Russian Reset, we're much better off than if we went under the New World Order Great Reset.
[01:29:28.454 --> 01:29:29.454]  Our leaders aren't thinking that.
[01:29:29.575 --> 01:29:32.816]  Our leaders are willing to let America get crushed by the Great Reset.
[01:29:33.716 --> 01:29:36.938]  Putin doesn't seem to have that same mentality towards his people.
[01:29:38.487 --> 01:29:41.628]  Adam Kinzinger is a total wussbag.
[01:29:42.288 --> 01:29:51.891]  Tucker Carlson invited him on his show and he rejected and then went on to Twitter to say, uh, Tucker Carlson is an agent of Vladimir Putin.
[01:29:52.531 --> 01:29:54.612]  And he only cares about the Ukrainian people.
[01:29:54.672 --> 01:29:55.372]  I'm not even kidding you.
[01:29:55.412 --> 01:29:57.513]  That's what Adam Kinzinger said in his statement.
[01:29:57.693 --> 01:30:01.094]  So, uh, more proof that Adam Kinzinger is just a complete hack.
[01:30:04.202 --> 01:30:09.445]  Russian spies infiltrated Ukraine's international volunteers to launch missile attack.
[01:30:09.505 --> 01:30:14.628]  Folks, I gotta tell ya, there's false flags happening in Ukraine.
[01:30:14.668 --> 01:30:15.829]  I mean, let's just call it what it is.
[01:30:16.849 --> 01:30:32.338]  There's obviously a Russian invasion, there's obviously skirmishes, there's obviously bombs and missiles and everything, but there are false flag attacks that they're blaming Russia, and it's proxy groups, it's infiltrators, it's spies, and it's odd, too.
[01:30:32.398 --> 01:30:41.669]   You see all these Civilian buildings getting bombed or it's like the missiles miss the building and maybe blow out a side of it or hit the ground and blow out some windows.
[01:30:42.009 --> 01:30:43.290]  Who's really doing that?
[01:30:44.531 --> 01:30:47.612]  Who is actually doing that in Ukraine?
[01:30:47.632 --> 01:31:01.972]   Alright folks, we're having a bit of a schedule realignment here I think due to some Time zone confusion plus the, uh, ridiculousness of daylight savings time, which just needs to be ended at this point.
[01:31:02.012 --> 01:31:02.993]  It's just a complete joke.
[01:31:03.733 --> 01:31:15.439]  But, uh, aside from that, um, Sean Stone is a little bit delayed, and so he will be in studio, hopefully at 1.30 is what we're hoping now, and then, and then we're just gonna have him back on in studio for the War Room.
[01:31:15.799 --> 01:31:19.541]  And, and since I'm mentioning that, we got huge guests coming up on the War Room today.
[01:31:19.581 --> 01:31:23.964]  We've got an individual who's in Ukraine, wants to give us on-the-ground reporting from there.
[01:31:24.804 --> 01:31:25.725]  Sean Stone as well.
[01:31:26.346 --> 01:31:41.406]  Tyler Nixon, attorney, is going to be joining us to discuss all kinds of different legal issues, including a disgusting case, ladies and gentlemen, that I really want to make a big deal of, and I know I've been covering it for a week, but it needs to be a much bigger deal than it is, where Democrats can now get away with murder.
[01:31:43.541 --> 01:31:45.882]  You think that sounds extreme?
[01:31:45.902 --> 01:31:46.403]  Yeah.
[01:31:46.923 --> 01:31:47.763]  I ain't lying, folks.
[01:31:47.863 --> 01:31:51.906]  Democrats can now get away with murder as long as you kill a Trump supporter in cold blood.
[01:31:52.166 --> 01:31:52.306]  Yeah.
[01:31:52.566 --> 01:31:54.027]  That's how bad it is in this country now.
[01:31:54.567 --> 01:31:57.149]  That's how bad the left has become in this country.
[01:31:58.803 --> 01:32:04.265]  From their street thug goon criminals to their Soros operatives in the judicial system.
[01:32:04.945 --> 01:32:08.906]  Democrats can now get away with murder if they kill in cold blood a Trump supporter.
[01:32:08.966 --> 01:32:10.646]  It's a ritualistic thing for them now.
[01:32:11.287 --> 01:32:14.468]  So I would expect it to continue since they continue to get away with it.
[01:32:17.368 --> 01:32:19.350]  Savannah Hernandez will be joining us.
[01:32:19.511 --> 01:32:26.297]  She was at the pro-pedophile rally here in Austin, Texas, and then they were out again at Georgia Tech yesterday.
[01:32:27.178 --> 01:32:28.680]  It's this new phenomenon, folks.
[01:32:29.380 --> 01:32:33.144]  Trans kids, trans rights, it's all fake.
[01:32:33.504 --> 01:32:35.286]  There's no such thing as trans kids.
[01:32:35.526 --> 01:32:37.288]  There's no such thing as trans rights.
[01:32:37.508 --> 01:32:40.752]  It's this made-up thing by the left to virtue signal as a victim.
[01:32:41.630 --> 01:32:43.790]  Where there is nothing to be had there.
[01:32:44.571 --> 01:32:50.011]  It's an empty shell of a protest, but they're at it again, so we'll get the latest on that too.
[01:32:52.012 --> 01:33:04.074]  We're on air because of your support at InfoWarsStore.com, and we are happy to announce, back in stock, a very popular item that always sells out.
[01:33:04.894 --> 01:33:09.195]  I mean, this thing usually sells out within a week or a month of us getting it back in stock.
[01:33:09.255 --> 01:33:10.695]  It's back in stock today.
[01:33:12.463 --> 01:33:19.988]  Vitamin D3 with calcium gummies back in stock at Infowars.com.
[01:33:20.989 --> 01:33:22.210]  Kids love these, folks.
[01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.051]  Kids love these.
[01:33:24.832 --> 01:33:31.757]  And let me just tell you, they're intentionally blocking out the sun by spraying chemicals into the air.
[01:33:32.197 --> 01:33:35.920]  You may remember now even CNN is admitting that's an ongoing operation.
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:46.525]   So you have globalists that want to stop you from getting the essential Rays from the sun, that's vitamin D3.
[01:33:47.586 --> 01:33:52.090]  That's how disgusting, that's how despicable our government is.
[01:33:52.210 --> 01:34:02.498]  They intentionally try to block out the sun with cloud seeding and geoengineering and chemtrailing, which now even CNN admits has been going on since the 1940s.
[01:34:02.798 --> 01:34:06.021]  So you may notice, hey, how come I never see the sun anymore?
[01:34:06.061 --> 01:34:09.403]  How come these lines are always in the sky and then I don't see the sun for two days?
[01:34:09.624 --> 01:34:10.865]  It's all by design, folks!
[01:34:11.926 --> 01:34:19.508]  The people that are trying to conquer this planet are trying to block you from getting the essential vitamin D3 from the sun's rays.
[01:34:20.068 --> 01:34:21.428]  The giver of life.
[01:34:21.448 --> 01:34:25.069]  That's why ancient civilizations worshipped the sun.
[01:34:26.570 --> 01:34:30.131]  And so, the disgusting globalists want to block it out.
[01:34:31.131 --> 01:34:32.331]  But, we have the answer.
[01:34:32.471 --> 01:34:35.372]  Vitamin D3 with calcium gummies at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:34:35.392 --> 01:34:36.532]  I'm telling you, kids love these.
[01:34:36.852 --> 01:34:38.293]  Good for adults too, obviously.
[01:34:39.232 --> 01:34:46.940]  And they're finally back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com and we are glad to make that announcement today.
[01:34:48.181 --> 01:34:48.661]  All right.
[01:34:52.605 --> 01:34:52.965]  All right.
[01:34:54.447 --> 01:35:00.593]  Let's finish up here with some of this Ukraine news and then get to some other stuff.
[01:35:02.901 --> 01:35:08.908]  Fox News cameraman Pierre Zakharovsky has died in Ukraine.
[01:35:08.829 --> 01:35:14.269]   sorry I'm not intentionally mispronounce that it's a tough one has died in
[01:35:14.269 --> 01:35:20.029]   Ukraine and I believe this is the third American either journalist or cameraman
[01:35:20.029 --> 01:35:26.708]   to have died in Ukraine now and you know they blamed Russia on the first one and
[01:35:26.708 --> 01:35:30.449]   it ended up being Ukraine So it's probably the same case here.
[01:35:30.489 --> 01:35:36.835]  This individual was probably killed by Ukrainian fire, just like the other individual, but they haven't really committed to a narrative there.
[01:35:36.895 --> 01:35:40.639]  But, you know, how does that make you feel, Adam Kinzinger?
[01:35:43.001 --> 01:35:45.323]  How does that make you feel, Lindsey Graham?
[01:35:46.503 --> 01:35:53.570]  Americans are now dying in Ukraine because of your warmongering and you promoting of them being over there.
[01:35:54.411 --> 01:35:56.553]  Hope that makes you feel really good.
[01:35:56.873 --> 01:35:58.195]  So more blood.
[01:35:59.946 --> 01:36:03.268]  More blood on the hands of the neocons and the neolibs.
[01:36:03.748 --> 01:36:05.329]  Promoting this war with Ukraine.
[01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:07.751]  Promoting Americans to go over there.
[01:36:07.791 --> 01:36:09.712]  By the way, British soldiers have been killed too.
[01:36:09.992 --> 01:36:10.853]  They blamed Russia.
[01:36:10.913 --> 01:36:12.594]  That might end up being Ukraine as well.
[01:36:12.654 --> 01:36:14.014]  That's just how it goes, folks.
[01:36:14.355 --> 01:36:15.816]  Everything they say ends up being a lie.
[01:36:16.216 --> 01:36:17.397]  So sorry that that's the...
[01:36:18.437 --> 01:36:27.200]  Uh, intellectual approach I take to this, maybe not the healthiest, but, uh, that's just been what has, how the story has unfolded every time.
[01:36:27.760 --> 01:36:30.681]  It's, whatever they say, the opposite ends up being true.
[01:36:30.741 --> 01:36:36.863]  So they say, oh, Russia killed this New York Times journalist, and then it's, oh, never mind, it was a spy in Ukraine killed him.
[01:36:38.884 --> 01:36:49.225]   But regardless of that, I hope all the neocons and the neolibs that have been promoting this war and promoting people going over there, I hope you feel good with all that blood on your hands.
[01:36:49.605 --> 01:36:57.194]  Or maybe you can't even see all the blood on your hands because of all the money you've made investing in the defense contractor company's stocks.
[01:36:59.477 --> 01:37:01.219]  Because that's what it's all about, folks.
[01:37:01.239 --> 01:37:02.300]  Because they're addicted to it.
[01:37:03.735 --> 01:37:04.995]  They're addicted to it.
[01:37:05.676 --> 01:37:10.997]  And they need those stocks to take off so they can cash out and buy a new vacation home.
[01:37:11.417 --> 01:37:12.678]  And it makes me sick.
[01:37:15.659 --> 01:37:16.539]  How's the U.S.
[01:37:16.579 --> 01:37:18.199]  military doing, though, by the way?
[01:37:18.820 --> 01:37:20.220]  Well, this might give you an idea.
[01:37:21.420 --> 01:37:28.342]  The undersecretary of the Air Force, Gina Ortiz-Jones, reporting for duty.
[01:37:29.523 --> 01:37:33.124]  Great conversation with our LGBTQ initiatives team.
[01:37:36.778 --> 01:37:41.479]  An LGBTQ initiatives team in the U.S.
[01:37:41.559 --> 01:37:41.859]  Army.
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:44.800]  You have got to be freaking kidding me.
[01:37:46.761 --> 01:37:49.562]  You think China has an LGBTQ initiatives team?
[01:37:50.862 --> 01:37:53.783]  You think Russia has an LGBTQ initiatives team?
[01:37:57.884 --> 01:37:58.404]  No, they don't.
[01:38:00.005 --> 01:38:01.045]  No, they don't.
[01:38:02.093 --> 01:38:04.755]  But see, this is all about the conquering of America.
[01:38:04.775 --> 01:38:22.429]  This is all about the conquering of our military and replacing hard patriotic men and women with foppish gays who get in there to diversify the military, no combat experience, not even the will to fight.
[01:38:23.190 --> 01:38:30.236]  I mean, you could sit here and say... I mean, look, I'll be perfectly honest, because I know the type.
[01:38:31.192 --> 01:38:34.095]  There's people that get involved in the U.S.
[01:38:34.155 --> 01:38:35.896]  military because they like to fight.
[01:38:37.298 --> 01:38:43.884]  And they want to channel that energy into being in the army and then going off to fight.
[01:38:44.104 --> 01:38:45.025]  And that's what they like.
[01:38:46.567 --> 01:38:48.448]  Well, let me tell you, you could say that's dangerous.
[01:38:49.069 --> 01:38:56.276]  That is 10 billion times better than to have somebody going into the military so they can make it more gay.
[01:38:57.406 --> 01:39:03.008]  Or they can promote transsexuals in the military and launch LGBTQ initiatives team.
[01:39:03.529 --> 01:39:03.769]  What.
[01:39:04.409 --> 01:39:05.329]  A. Joke.
[01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:08.230]  That's our military.
[01:39:09.531 --> 01:39:10.491]  That's General Milley.
[01:39:10.731 --> 01:39:11.712]  That's Lloyd Austin.
[01:39:12.312 --> 01:39:13.993]  Sanctioned by Vladimir Putin.
[01:39:14.993 --> 01:39:16.274]  So think about it like this.
[01:39:16.674 --> 01:39:21.736]  Vladimir Putin is doing more to drain the swamp in America than anybody here is.
[01:39:24.070 --> 01:39:28.313]  I mean, you could even say Vladimir Putin has done more than Donald Trump to drain the swamp.
[01:39:30.694 --> 01:39:32.755]  I don't remember Trump going after these people.
[01:39:34.116 --> 01:39:37.418]  He took their abuse for four years and took no action.
[01:39:38.479 --> 01:39:41.301]  Putin has actually taken action against these criminal scumbags.
[01:39:42.688 --> 01:39:43.628]  But don't worry, guys.
[01:39:44.369 --> 01:39:44.869]  Don't worry.
[01:39:44.929 --> 01:39:55.392]  The big, bad, gay army is gonna defeat the Chinese and the Russian militaries, which are clearly getting closer to a strong military alliance.
[01:39:56.773 --> 01:39:57.293]  But don't worry.
[01:39:57.333 --> 01:40:01.234]  The big, gay army of Milley and Austin, they'll be there to rescue.
[01:40:01.254 --> 01:40:02.355]  Yeah, right.
[01:40:03.255 --> 01:40:08.637]  I wanna take a look at some of the political news happening in America here.
[01:40:10.523 --> 01:40:19.988]  Before we are joined by an in-studio guest coming up, Rand Paul, introducing the Fauci Amendment to Prevent Health Dictatorship.
[01:40:20.048 --> 01:40:21.028]  Thank you, Rand Paul.
[01:40:21.749 --> 01:40:36.096]  Next, it's time for Fauci to be tried in a criminal court of law, not just lying under oath, but crimes against humanity, for his involvement in the Wuhan lab and in all of the destructive policies that he promoted.
[01:40:37.217 --> 01:40:40.818]   from vaccine mandates, mask mandates, lockdowns and everything else.
[01:40:40.818 --> 01:40:48.018]   I wish Fauci would just go away, but since he won't, maybe there needs to be criminal trials
[01:40:48.018 --> 01:40:52.657]   so that we have to put him into a jail cell for all of his crimes. But it does appear that the
[01:40:52.657 --> 01:41:02.337]   reason why Fauci is protected is Fauci is not a health care bureaucrat.
[01:41:02.532 --> 01:41:07.574]  Fauci is not Dr. Fauci of the NIH or whatever it is.
[01:41:08.074 --> 01:41:10.896]  Fauci is actually the head of the U.S.
[01:41:10.936 --> 01:41:12.376]  Biological Weapons Program.
[01:41:12.936 --> 01:41:14.157]  And that's why he's being protected.
[01:41:15.489 --> 01:41:18.652]  Fauci is the head, it appears to me, that Fauci is the head of the U.S.
[01:41:18.712 --> 01:41:31.604]  Biological Weapons Program, posing as a health bureaucrat, and, uh, well, it's, it's, it's just, it's time for a full investigation to be done to Anthony Fauci with the crimes he's committed against humanity for decades now.
[01:41:33.306 --> 01:41:37.490]  Democrat midterm chief Sean Patrick Maloney, we are the problem!
[01:41:38.683 --> 01:41:39.584]  We are the problem.
[01:41:39.624 --> 01:42:01.184]  Yes, non-radicalized Democrats that aren't fully communist, leftist, progressives, etc., are realizing that their party is dead if it continues to go the way of defund the police, major crimes, censorship, war, and just, quite frankly, complete insanity.
[01:42:02.485 --> 01:42:11.756]   So that's why centrists or Non-insane Democrats are saying, hey, we gotta check ourselves because we're wrecking ourselves here.
[01:42:13.317 --> 01:42:16.579]  The real answer is to just abandon the Democrat Party and just let it die.
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:23.145]  Because the Democrat Party has been the biggest terror group in the United States of America for over a century.
[01:42:24.566 --> 01:42:52.648]   I mean, I'm not gonna sit here and go into Civil War history, but it was Democrats that Went after Fort Sumter, and again, I'm not going to get into all that stuff, but it's Democrats with the KKK, it's Democrats like Bill Ayers blowing up government buildings, it's Democrats that burn cities to the ground in the riots of 2020, so I mean, you know, you just go on, it's always the Democrats destroying public parks and ripping statues down, killing millions of babies, always Democrats.
[01:42:53.208 --> 01:42:57.151]  But see, they're protected, they're protected, they're a protected class now.
[01:42:58.422 --> 01:43:03.475]  Only conservatives in America can be punished by law enforcement now.
[01:43:03.575 --> 01:43:05.279]  Democrats literally get away with murder.
[01:43:06.525 --> 01:43:11.926]  But, uh, oh, you were on the wrong piece of cement on January 6th, uh, or not even in D.C.
[01:43:11.966 --> 01:43:12.906]  They're coming after you.
[01:43:13.307 --> 01:43:16.107]  Oh, you questioned the 2020 election and they make sure to put it there.
[01:43:16.827 --> 01:43:21.588]  Uh, Mayorkas, only if you question the 2020 election can you be subject to being called a terrorist.
[01:43:22.089 --> 01:43:24.109]  Oh, you don't like vaccine mandates, you're a terrorist.
[01:43:24.689 --> 01:43:33.691]   It's, it's the Biden administration wanting to make all It's political opposition terrorists so that they can put us all in jail, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:34.111 --> 01:43:36.952]  Believe me when I tell you, because I'm at the top of their list.
[01:43:37.092 --> 01:43:45.914]  I've got the Democrat Party and the federal government sucking on my, stuck on, clawing at my back, sucking at my neck like a freaking vampire.
[01:43:47.554 --> 01:43:50.855]  Trust me, it's not fun, but they're coming for you next.
[01:43:52.651 --> 01:43:59.313]  No Integrity, 60 Minutes Commits Journalism Fraud in Dishonest Exposé on Wisconsin Election Investigation.
[01:43:59.374 --> 01:44:07.557]  Yeah, the state legislatures in Wisconsin have basically said, yeah, Biden didn't win here, clear election theft, here's all the evidence.
[01:44:07.637 --> 01:44:11.198]  I mean, folks, they've voted to decertify the election.
[01:44:11.238 --> 01:44:16.620]  Now, this is at the state level, so it's not where it needs to be fully, and I'm not saying it's going to matter in time.
[01:44:18.208 --> 01:44:21.311]  That's kind of a long shot miracle, if you will.
[01:44:21.972 --> 01:44:30.300]  But no, the state legislator there in Wisconsin has 100% decided that Biden did not win the state and there was election fraud rampant.
[01:44:31.040 --> 01:44:36.566]  But oh, oh, oh, see, now the Biden administration says I'm a terrorist because I'm actually covering that news.
[01:44:36.866 --> 01:44:39.469]  That's how dictatorships work.
[01:44:39.529 --> 01:44:41.230]  That's how authoritarianism works.
[01:44:41.691 --> 01:44:42.772]  That's the Democrat Party.
[01:44:44.502 --> 01:44:47.805]  Florida fires a warning shot at Democrat ballot traffickers.
[01:44:47.845 --> 01:44:50.808]  State will make possession of more than two voter ballots a felony.
[01:44:51.248 --> 01:44:52.790]  And Democrats are pushing back on this.
[01:44:52.830 --> 01:44:53.650]  Well, why would that be?
[01:44:53.811 --> 01:44:54.671]  Because they cheat!
[01:44:54.691 --> 01:44:56.053]  It's really that simple.
[01:44:57.314 --> 01:44:59.035]  Why don't Democrats like voter ID laws?
[01:44:59.155 --> 01:44:59.976]  Because they cheat!
[01:45:00.617 --> 01:45:03.980]  Why don't Democrats like ending vote harvesting laws?
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.181]  Because the Democrats cheat!
[01:45:05.201 --> 01:45:08.544]  It's always Republicans trying to have fair and free elections.
[01:45:08.584 --> 01:45:10.086]  The Democrats are always the ones cheating.
[01:45:10.794 --> 01:45:11.735]  It's an interesting concept.
[01:45:11.976 --> 01:45:15.581]  Do you really think Nancy Pelosi wins any election fairly?
[01:45:15.821 --> 01:45:19.006]  Do you really think Joe Biden wins an election fairly?
[01:45:19.206 --> 01:45:19.707]  Come on!
[01:45:20.588 --> 01:45:21.329]  Come on!
[01:45:21.389 --> 01:45:24.033]  It's time to stop thinking Santa Claus exists, folks.
[01:45:24.073 --> 01:45:25.195]  Santa Claus is not real.
[01:45:27.674 --> 01:45:33.680]  Pelosi argues spending trillions of dollars lowers national debt and blames global inflation on Putin.
[01:45:34.020 --> 01:45:38.304]  Nancy Pelosi is so hopped up on drugs or alcohol or both, I can't tell.
[01:45:38.845 --> 01:45:43.750]  Or maybe she's just that out of her mind now in her old age with all the history of drug abuse.
[01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:45.451]  This woman is a danger.
[01:45:45.491 --> 01:45:47.393]  This woman is a threat to this country and the world.
[01:45:48.214 --> 01:45:49.816]  And we played the clip of her earlier.
[01:45:49.876 --> 01:45:51.998]  Folks, she is just, it is not good.
[01:45:53.268 --> 01:45:54.289]  It is just not good.
[01:45:54.329 --> 01:45:59.951]  That is an insane, psychotic dingbat who's calling for war with Russia.
[01:46:02.432 --> 01:46:04.813]  Oh, but see, they go after Trump.
[01:46:04.873 --> 01:46:06.474]  They subpoena my family.
[01:46:07.054 --> 01:46:16.799]  I never even went to the Capitol on January 6th, never touched a police officer, never touched a barrier, never did a damn thing, and they subpoena me and they subpoena my family.
[01:46:18.442 --> 01:46:27.747]  But Nancy Pelosi claims that she has sovereign immunity and so she's not going to be turning over any of her emails in regards to January 6th.
[01:46:27.807 --> 01:46:28.648]  Well, what does that mean?
[01:46:28.828 --> 01:46:30.569]  That means Pelosi has something to hide.
[01:46:31.616 --> 01:46:32.836]  What does Pelosi have to hide?
[01:46:33.437 --> 01:46:47.381]  Pelosi is hiding the fact that she'd been communicating with the Democrat mayor of D.C., Muriel Bowser, about standing down the police, taking police off the force that day, and making sure the National Guard couldn't be in D.C.
[01:46:47.662 --> 01:46:57.185]  so they could run their operation on January 6th, cause a bunch of violence, break into the Capitol, play the victim, and then try to conquer America that way.
[01:46:58.086 --> 01:46:59.128]  And that's what they did.
[01:46:59.649 --> 01:47:10.828]  And that's why Nancy Pelosi is not turning over her emails, but then my family gets subpoenaed to turn over all of our electronic communications, when my family has nothing to do with any of this!
[01:47:12.196 --> 01:47:15.077]  But see, they know, they've looked up and down me, folks.
[01:47:15.097 --> 01:47:17.258]  I mean, I've gotten the whole proctology exam.
[01:47:17.458 --> 01:47:18.439]  There's nothing here!
[01:47:19.019 --> 01:47:20.140]  You know there's nothing here!
[01:47:20.340 --> 01:47:21.901]  So what, you're gonna go after my family now?
[01:47:21.941 --> 01:47:23.741]  But oh, Pelosi gets sovereign immunity!
[01:47:24.022 --> 01:47:24.862]  Trump, though, doesn't!
[01:47:25.482 --> 01:47:28.604]  Who was the president, and there's actually laws on the books!
[01:47:29.656 --> 01:47:35.200]  That give Trump immunity to these investigations and they say, nope, we're going to come after you with the New York Attorney General.
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:37.101]  We're going to come after you with the Southern District Court.
[01:47:37.301 --> 01:47:38.642]  We're going to come after you with Congress.
[01:47:38.662 --> 01:47:40.643]  We're going to come after you with January 6th Committee.
[01:47:40.924 --> 01:47:43.085]  We're going to come after Trump and he gets no immunity.
[01:47:43.385 --> 01:47:53.792]  But that corrupt lying bat witch, Nancy Pelosi, claims that she has sovereign immunity because she wants to cover up the fact that she was involved in the whole thing.
[01:47:54.072 --> 01:47:58.415]  And she and Muriel Bowser were organizing the entire January 6th thing.
[01:47:58.675 --> 01:48:04.434]   It wasn't Trump, it wasn't Alex Jones, it wasn't General Flynn, it wasn't Roger Stone,
[01:48:04.434 --> 01:48:07.914]  it wasn't the Proud Boys, it wasn't the Oath Keepers, no.
[01:48:07.845 --> 01:48:25.638]  It was the Democrat Party, I guarantee you, it was the Democrat Party is the only phone records or emails that you can find with any preconceived notions of violence on January 6th, or any premeditated activities on January 6th.
[01:48:26.098 --> 01:48:28.100]  They've searched everywhere, folks, they can't find it.
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:29.221]  You know where they haven't searched yet?
[01:48:29.821 --> 01:48:32.483]  Nancy Pelosi, Muriel Bowser, that's where you'll find it.
[01:48:33.423 --> 01:48:36.926]  Yeah, there's me, legally, in the U.S.
[01:48:36.966 --> 01:48:39.687]  Capitol, with a piece of tape over my mouth.
[01:48:39.868 --> 01:48:43.070]  I got arrested and spent more than a day in jail.
[01:48:43.110 --> 01:48:45.631]  I think it was 27 hours when all said and done.
[01:48:46.912 --> 01:48:52.736]  But a liberal activist murders a Trump supporter in Denver and gets away with it.
[01:48:53.036 --> 01:48:55.117]  Yeah, the judge just dropped the case.
[01:48:55.418 --> 01:48:57.219]  And we're going to have that news coming up on The War Room.
[01:48:58.072 --> 01:49:00.473]  Um, I'm just going to continue with my coverage here.
[01:49:02.454 --> 01:49:04.294]  Uh, in-studio guest, probably not going to happen today.
[01:49:04.354 --> 01:49:05.335]  Maybe it'll happen in the war room.
[01:49:05.355 --> 01:49:06.455]  I'm not really sure at this point.
[01:49:06.955 --> 01:49:09.676]  So, let's just continue my news coverage here.
[01:49:11.017 --> 01:49:13.938]  Looking at some more of the latest news here out of America.
[01:49:15.592 --> 01:49:20.357]  Laid off Keystone Pipeline workers shred Biden for his lies about American oil production.
[01:49:20.497 --> 01:49:23.119]  I'm sick of hearing this is Putin's price hike.
[01:49:23.680 --> 01:49:25.802]  Just like the other day on The War Room, I opened up the phone lines.
[01:49:25.822 --> 01:49:30.506]  We had people that work in the oil industry come in, say this is BS, everything Biden administration's saying is a lie.
[01:49:31.447 --> 01:49:34.089]  But an in-studio guest on Sunday breaking it all down too.
[01:49:35.313 --> 01:49:50.445]  And so, you can only lie to the people so much until your lies are so flagrant and so wide-reaching that there's thousands or millions of Americans that know you're lying because they're involved in the lie, and you're lying about them.
[01:49:51.166 --> 01:49:55.469]  And that's what the globalist threshold has been crossed now.
[01:49:55.509 --> 01:49:58.391]  That's what the Democrat lie threshold has been crossed.
[01:49:58.412 --> 01:49:59.813]  I mean, it's like January 6th.
[01:50:00.213 --> 01:50:01.994]  Millions of people were there on January 6th.
[01:50:02.014 --> 01:50:03.796]  They know everything being reported about is a lie.
[01:50:05.299 --> 01:50:10.142]  People go to Trump rallies, and then they tune into the news and say, Trump rally was a violent riot!
[01:50:10.182 --> 01:50:11.362]  And they were like, I was just there.
[01:50:11.382 --> 01:50:13.484]  It was 20,000 people peacefully chanting USA.
[01:50:13.504 --> 01:50:14.104]  What are you talking about?
[01:50:14.524 --> 01:50:16.285]  The media are liars!
[01:50:16.385 --> 01:50:18.266]  Our politicians are liars!
[01:50:19.527 --> 01:50:21.488]  And no, it's not the Putin price hike.
[01:50:21.528 --> 01:50:22.809]  It's not Putin inflation.
[01:50:22.929 --> 01:50:24.130]  It's Biden inflation.
[01:50:24.510 --> 01:50:25.731]  It's the Biden gas pump.
[01:50:25.871 --> 01:50:28.052]  I mean, folks, I don't know what it's like in your areas.
[01:50:29.793 --> 01:50:33.275]  And I was thinking about doing this, but it's like, maybe it's too late.
[01:50:35.782 --> 01:50:43.765]  When Trump got out of office, and I'm ballparking here, gas was about $2.50.
[01:50:47.267 --> 01:50:50.148]  Gas was about $2.50 when Trump left office.
[01:50:51.529 --> 01:50:57.832]  When Biden got into office, and this is in Texas, a year later, it was up to $3.50.
[01:50:59.933 --> 01:51:03.114]  Now, in the last four months, it's up to $4.50.
[01:51:07.236 --> 01:51:09.116]  And I'm so glad you guys put this up.
[01:51:09.256 --> 01:51:10.337]  I'm in sync with the crew.
[01:51:10.497 --> 01:51:20.018]  I was going to say, it used to be, like for the last year, I'd see the Biden, I did that sticker on the gas pump.
[01:51:20.078 --> 01:51:21.839]  Maybe one every 10 times I fill up.
[01:51:21.959 --> 01:51:30.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, every single time I go to fill up my gas tank now, there's a Biden sticker, I did that on the gas pump.
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.801]  Or you can tell somebody has removed four or five of them.
[01:51:35.247 --> 01:51:39.551]  It's somebody just scraping them off, a gas station employee just scraping them off it, but you can see that they're there.
[01:51:40.692 --> 01:51:45.276]  I've also seen people write on Sharpie at the gas station, Biden did this.
[01:51:45.856 --> 01:51:47.958]  Because I guess they're sick of their stickers being removed.
[01:51:48.939 --> 01:51:51.141]  So, America knows what's going on.
[01:51:52.042 --> 01:51:57.467]  They're not falling for the Putin boogeyman lies of the corporate press.
[01:51:58.748 --> 01:51:59.709]  They know what's going on.
[01:52:02.316 --> 01:52:10.923]  And now people are even starting to notice that, hey, how come the price of gasoline is going up so much, it's not accurately going along with the price of oil?
[01:52:10.943 --> 01:52:12.825]  Well, I think there's a couple reasons for that.
[01:52:14.106 --> 01:52:21.352]  I think gas companies are trying to make up for the massive losses that Biden has caused by stalling the new oil production.
[01:52:21.672 --> 01:52:28.198]  They suffered probably billions of dollars in losses because of that, so now they're trying to make it up by increasing gas prices.
[01:52:28.939 --> 01:52:38.015]   And I also think that It's more of a futures thing where they're anticipating the price of gas and the price of oil is going to go up per barrel.
[01:52:38.595 --> 01:52:44.977]  Astronomically, considering how the whole world is basically being leveraged against Biden, not against Putin.
[01:52:44.997 --> 01:52:45.877]  See, that's the big lie.
[01:52:46.097 --> 01:52:48.918]  The media wants you to think the world is being leveraged against Putin.
[01:52:49.218 --> 01:52:50.318]  It's the exact opposite.
[01:52:50.539 --> 01:52:53.219]  The world is being leveraged against Biden, folks.
[01:52:54.460 --> 01:53:01.347]   So I think American gas companies are saying Biden's about to F us up the butt.
[01:53:02.388 --> 01:53:08.589]  So we gotta put gas out as expensive as we possibly can right now because we're about to get crushed.
[01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:19.192]  Folks, you have Democrats today in Congress who are trying to get a vote to ban all U.S.
[01:53:19.372 --> 01:53:19.552]  oil.
[01:53:21.072 --> 01:53:27.494]  So yeah, you don't think gas prices are going to go up with the Democrats saying they're going to shut down U.S.
[01:53:27.614 --> 01:53:27.734]  oil?
[01:53:29.718 --> 01:53:32.879]  You're gonna see $10 a gallon gasoline, I would say, by the end of the year.
[01:53:32.919 --> 01:53:33.299]  Who knows?
[01:53:33.339 --> 01:53:34.119]  Might be sooner than that.
[01:53:34.359 --> 01:53:35.119]  I don't want to see that.
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:40.881]  But it's this big joke where Biden says, We want to drill oil!
[01:53:40.961 --> 01:53:42.441]  We're drilling more oil than ever!
[01:53:42.821 --> 01:53:45.282]  And then, in his campaign, he says he's gonna end oil.
[01:53:45.622 --> 01:53:48.762]  And you have Democrats wanting to have a vote on the House right now.
[01:53:49.223 --> 01:53:51.083]  They're demanding... I mean, guys, plug it in.
[01:53:52.943 --> 01:53:59.385]  House Democrats are demanding Biden declare a climate emergency and end all oil production in America.
[01:54:01.365 --> 01:54:06.887]  You don't think the oil and gas companies see that and think, okay, well, we're about to be crushed.
[01:54:07.627 --> 01:54:10.808]  I gotta sell oil at top dollar because I don't have a choice now.
[01:54:12.308 --> 01:54:13.489]  It's not a charity, folks.
[01:54:17.850 --> 01:54:22.432]  But then there's the media telling you, oh, the whole world is being leveraged against Putin.
[01:54:23.532 --> 01:54:25.072]  Maybe China likes Putin, maybe they don't.
[01:54:25.112 --> 01:54:26.833]  Maybe Saudi Arabia likes Putin, maybe they don't.
[01:54:27.728 --> 01:54:29.450]  Maybe Saudi Arabia likes China, maybe they don't.
[01:54:30.110 --> 01:54:31.471]  They're all against Biden.
[01:54:32.272 --> 01:54:34.074]  They don't take Biden's phone calls.
[01:54:34.354 --> 01:54:37.056]  They don't invite Biden for diplomatic conversations.
[01:54:37.316 --> 01:54:42.981]  They kick Biden's diplomats like Jake Sullivan out and spit on him on the way out.
[01:54:45.243 --> 01:54:48.626]  That's how pathetic Biden's administration is and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are.
[01:54:48.887 --> 01:54:49.707]  It's a joke.
[01:54:50.328 --> 01:54:51.329]  Where is Biden, by the way?
[01:54:51.409 --> 01:54:53.070]  Anybody heard from Biden recently?
[01:54:55.382 --> 01:55:00.266]  No, the world is being leveraged against Biden and America, folks, and you're being lied to about it.
[01:55:01.386 --> 01:55:09.712]  And I'm telling you, the big shoe to drop, and it's not a shoe, it's a steel-toed boot, size 20.
[01:55:11.954 --> 01:55:23.453]   If Saudi Arabia and China start doing oil deals using the Chinese yuan, That's the biggest loss in a U.S.
[01:55:23.553 --> 01:55:25.994]  presidency's history in modern-day history.
[01:55:26.155 --> 01:55:27.415]  I can't think of a bigger loss than that.
[01:55:27.615 --> 01:55:28.075]  I really can't.
[01:55:28.095 --> 01:55:35.099]  I mean, you can talk about the devastation of the Afghanistan pullout and so many other things.
[01:55:35.239 --> 01:55:40.162]  Folks, if that happens, the United States' leverage on this planet and the power of the U.S.
[01:55:40.182 --> 01:55:42.743]  dollar is gone overnight.
[01:55:44.571 --> 01:55:47.433]  You really think the world is being leveraged against Putin?
[01:55:47.813 --> 01:55:48.814]  You're an idiot.
[01:55:49.495 --> 01:55:51.516]  The world is being leveraged against Biden.
[01:55:51.796 --> 01:55:58.361]  And all Biden had to do, all the US had to do, all our media had to do was just back off.
[01:55:58.601 --> 01:55:59.041]  That's all!
[01:55:59.902 --> 01:56:00.703]  That's all they had to do!
[01:56:01.943 --> 01:56:08.906]  But no, we have to deal with neocon freaks like Lindsey Graham calling for the assassination of Putin.
[01:56:09.146 --> 01:56:15.348]  We have to deal with neolib freaks like Nancy Pelosi calling for bombing Russia.
[01:56:17.096 --> 01:56:25.259]  You don't think China and Saudi Arabia sees Biden and Pelosi and Lindsey Graham and says, huh, why would we deal with these freaks?
[01:56:25.739 --> 01:56:27.640]  Why would we deal with these liars?
[01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:29.580]  Let's just cut the U.S.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:30.381]  out entirely.
[01:56:30.421 --> 01:56:31.761]  Let's never deal with Bidens.
[01:56:32.061 --> 01:56:34.422]  Let's never deal with these corrupt bastards ever again.
[01:56:34.662 --> 01:56:35.882]  And that's what they're going to do.
[01:56:38.383 --> 01:56:39.384]  And then there's the U.S.
[01:56:39.404 --> 01:56:41.504]  media telling you, oh, Biden's winning.
[01:56:41.564 --> 01:56:42.685]  Biden's so great.
[01:56:42.945 --> 01:56:44.846]  The world's being leveraged against Putin.
[01:56:45.266 --> 01:56:45.806]  Wrong.
[01:56:46.926 --> 01:56:47.566]  Wrong!
[01:56:48.146 --> 01:56:49.987]  And you're about to find out the hard way.
[01:56:51.447 --> 01:56:54.188]  Oh, but see, here's what happens in America.
[01:56:57.909 --> 01:57:01.670]  Black student behind racist graffiti at Rochester Girls' School.
[01:57:02.010 --> 01:57:03.931]  So it happens again, another fake hate crime.
[01:57:04.131 --> 01:57:14.694]  You know, because racism is so prevalent in this country, we have to fake hate crimes, like Jussie Smollett, who still thinks he's going to be killed in prison, saying he's not suicidal, making comments to his family.
[01:57:16.223 --> 01:57:24.110]  So a black girl goes onto a school board and writes a bunch of n-words and racist tropes and then accuses the school of a hate crime.
[01:57:24.330 --> 01:57:26.431]  They investigate, turns out she was the one that did it.
[01:57:27.673 --> 01:57:27.993]  Nice.
[01:57:29.234 --> 01:57:30.835]  That's the maturity level of America.
[01:57:31.195 --> 01:57:32.657]  That's where America's at right now.
[01:57:34.858 --> 01:57:36.280]  Man, oh man, we're being crushed.
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:48.979]   Our politicians are feckless criminals and much of our Citizenry is... I mean, what do you even call somebody that fakes a hate crime like this?
[01:57:49.679 --> 01:57:53.241]  Just total scumbags, ignoramuses, brainwashed fools.
[01:57:53.581 --> 01:57:55.682]  We're back here live on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:55.782 --> 01:57:58.584]  Sean Stone in studio with me now for one segment.
[01:57:58.604 --> 01:58:03.247]  He'll be back on The War Room with Wayne Allyn Root coming up in the fourth hour.
[01:58:05.618 --> 01:58:08.919]  Your father put out a great documentary, Ukraine on Fire.
[01:58:09.119 --> 01:58:13.981]  It recently got banned on a bunch of platforms, so we put it up at Banned.video.
[01:58:14.021 --> 01:58:15.801]  I think it's encroaching a million views now.
[01:58:15.881 --> 01:58:19.402]  I was able to watch about half of it the other night, and it made sense to me why they banned it.
[01:58:20.062 --> 01:58:42.497]   It came out in 2016, and you watch this, and you realize Ukraine has long been embedded with corruption, political corruption, money laundering, all this stuff, and you watch it and you realize, wait a second, I'm not going to pass judgment on the people of Ukraine or Ukraine good or bad, but there was clearly widespread political corruption there and they don't want this information to be known.
[01:58:42.517 --> 01:58:54.500]  Look, even Victoria Nuland on the cover of it, they don't want this information to be known now because all the propaganda they're putting out about Ukraine is put to rest if you simply watch this documentary which came out six years ago.
[01:58:56.340 --> 01:58:57.981]  It was the first of two documentaries.
[01:58:58.141 --> 01:59:04.563]  And so what YouTube did essentially by flagging it or banning it, I mean, you can't ban content in this day and age.
[01:59:04.603 --> 01:59:06.524]  Thankfully, we have the alternative sources now.
[01:59:06.564 --> 01:59:12.575]   We have the rumbles and the banned video and countless other other outlets that we can get it through and it's just
[01:59:12.575 --> 01:59:16.345]   impossible to censor people the way that they would like to. In fact, what it did, I think, was make
[01:59:16.345 --> 01:59:20.605]   it even more attractive and more appealing and more of interest, right? Because people say, well, you're
[01:59:20.605 --> 01:59:24.775]   censoring these guys after you censored Dr. Malone and all those other people last year,
[01:59:24.775 --> 01:59:28.775]   threatened to censor Joe Rogan last year. I think a lot of people have been waking up in this
[01:59:28.775 --> 01:59:33.795]   past two years, thankfully. And I feel like those that didn't wake up with COVID will never wake up
[01:59:33.795 --> 01:59:39.314]   because it's, you know, if you're being forced to be masked, muzzled, forced to be vaccinated, and
[01:59:39.314 --> 01:59:43.024]   you don't think that there's anything wrong with that, well, you don't really belong in a free country.
[01:59:43.237 --> 01:59:52.405]   But I think those that really have become skeptical and realizing, well, the censorship is a real thing, and then they see This documentary being banned, hey, that should stoke a little bit of curiosity in you.
[01:59:52.745 --> 01:59:58.107]  And you start to realize, as you said, that this is a, you know, the denazification that Putin is talking about.
[01:59:58.127 --> 01:59:59.748]  I just say, well, watch Ukraine on fire.
[01:59:59.768 --> 02:00:08.031]  It explains to you, you know, how much we brought, we allowed this, not just we as in the US, because we were arming Ukraine through this time period.
[02:00:08.070 --> 02:00:12.591]   initially, we said we didn't want to arm them because there were these neo-Nazi groups,
[02:00:12.591 --> 02:00:16.871]   like Azov battalion, that were incorporated into the military. And we said, well, you
[02:00:16.871 --> 02:00:20.190]   know, we can't, we can't arm these guys, they're Nazis. But then all of a sudden we shifted
[02:00:20.190 --> 02:00:25.711]   by 2016 and we continued to arm and continued to basically push for the armament of Ukraine.
[02:00:25.711 --> 02:00:30.590]   You sit there and go, well, you know, you can say all you want that Ukraine is a, you
[02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:35.150]   know, a pacifist country or peaceful country, but they've been arming themselves very much
[02:00:35.150 --> 02:00:39.350]   like a NATO, like a, you know, the next step being NATO, but they've been arming themselves
[02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:42.390]  like a part of NATO with all this weaponry and whatnot.
[02:00:42.416 --> 02:00:45.878]  So it's not like they were just sitting there, you know, peacefully minding their own business.
[02:00:45.958 --> 02:00:49.139]  They were preparing themselves in a very anti-Russian slant since 2014.
[02:00:49.939 --> 02:00:50.600]  And that's the point.
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:54.181]  This is a country, Ukraine, that a hundred years ago you would have called Kiev, Russia.
[02:00:54.541 --> 02:00:55.942]  It was part of Russia a hundred years ago.
[02:00:55.982 --> 02:01:01.324]  So don't, we can't fool ourselves and just say, you know, Russia is just, you know, ambitious and trying to conquer the world.
[02:01:01.384 --> 02:01:03.965]  No, there's a very particular relationship Russia has.
[02:01:04.025 --> 02:01:05.346]  A lot of the population is Russian.
[02:01:06.006 --> 02:01:07.667]  Uh, Russian descent, Russian language.
[02:01:08.067 --> 02:01:19.232]  So, there's a very close relationship between Ukraine and Russia, and since 2014, we have been pushing, along with Europe, along with the Soros factions, pushing to basically make Ukraine anti-Russian.
[02:01:19.272 --> 02:01:30.897]  And listen, if Mexico became anti-American tomorrow, cut off relationships economically with us, started bringing Russian or Chinese weapons and missiles and things like this to Mexico, you don't think we'd be pissed off?
[02:01:32.638 --> 02:01:37.459]  Really, it's actually worse with the Ukraine situation, because as you said, that was actually part of Russia at one point.
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:47.762]  And I don't think it's a coincidence that one of the last things that happened in Congress under Obama was they solidified that, yes, we're going to arm these Nazis.
[02:01:47.782 --> 02:01:51.123]  I mean, that was one of the things Congress approved, arming Nazis in Ukraine.
[02:01:51.143 --> 02:01:52.303]  It was mainstream news at the time.
[02:01:52.604 --> 02:01:55.124]  That was one of the last things Congress did under the Obama administration.
[02:01:55.684 --> 02:01:57.125]  I don't think that was coincidental.
[02:01:57.445 --> 02:02:09.793]   No, no, no, of course not, because we're fine with the, you know, again, NATO, think about the origins of NATO and how much of it was designed based on the Nazi apparatus, the Nazi Eastern Front apparatus.
[02:02:09.813 --> 02:02:13.616]  I mean, people who've studied the CIA are familiar with a guy named Reinhard Galen, right?
[02:02:14.017 --> 02:02:19.401]  And Galen being basically one of the chief officers of the Nazis on the Eastern Front, their intel guy.
[02:02:19.762 --> 02:02:23.385]  And he became a major architect of the CIA under Dulles.
[02:02:23.465 --> 02:02:26.985]   Of course, I mean, Dulles and these guys, Allen Dulles and company, I mean, they were
[02:02:26.985 --> 02:02:30.904]   working to bank with, you know, to work to bring the money to Hitler.
[02:02:30.904 --> 02:02:35.224]   You know, there were lawyers that were helping the banks and the standard oils and all these
[02:02:35.224 --> 02:02:38.744]  different groups here in America to do deals with the Nazis.
[02:02:38.744 --> 02:02:41.065]  So, you know, it's not like we were anti-Nazi.
[02:02:41.065 --> 02:02:44.864]   There were a lot of Anglo-Americans that were pushing for Hitler to go East.
[02:02:44.864 --> 02:02:48.105]   Since before, you know, since the beginning of the Nazi Party, since Hitler's rise to
[02:02:48.105 --> 02:02:51.904]   power, this whole Anglo-American faction I talk about in my New World Order book was
[02:02:51.904 --> 02:02:57.305]   actually gearing Hitler against the Russians, against, you know, the Stalin's Soviet Union
[02:02:58.008 --> 02:02:59.389]  And so the Russians don't forget this.
[02:02:59.449 --> 02:03:12.698]  They know exactly what a lot of the Western powers have been, you know, the intention of the Western powers has been basically anti-Russia since the turn of, not even the turn of the century, since the 19th century, since the British were allying with the Turks against them in the Crimean War.
[02:03:13.118 --> 02:03:19.400]   And then all through the 20th century really with post-World War I when again they started developing the
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:23.180]   German rearmament after the First World War
[02:03:23.180 --> 02:03:27.220]   to fight Russia. So the Russians haven't forgotten, they know what the
[02:03:27.220 --> 02:03:28.020]  West is doing.
[02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:32.260]   Well and the foresight, whether intentional or not, of this documentary
[02:03:33.070 --> 02:03:35.331]  It's almost as if they kind of missed this.
[02:03:35.952 --> 02:03:46.779]  I think they probably wish they would have censored that documentary probably a year ago before all this, because their censorship post the most recent struggle in Ukraine has actually just made more eyes on it.
[02:03:46.839 --> 02:03:49.100]  I mean, it's got over a million views on banned out video.
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:53.403]  I'm sure more people have watched it in the last year than the year prior and the year prior to that.
[02:03:53.743 --> 02:03:55.204]  So it's almost like they kind of missed this.
[02:03:55.244 --> 02:03:57.766]  They hit the censorship button on that documentary a little too late.
[02:03:58.246 --> 02:04:01.987]  But, I mean, talk about the foresight of the documentary.
[02:04:02.067 --> 02:04:05.868]  I mean, did your father put that out because he saw this coming?
[02:04:06.168 --> 02:04:10.590]  Or was it just his interest in the story of Ukraine that made him want to do that documentary?
[02:04:10.750 --> 02:04:14.851]  No, the director of the documentary is Igor Lapotinok, who is a Ukrainian-Russian.
[02:04:14.871 --> 02:04:16.611]  I mean, he's from Ukraine in the Soviet era.
[02:04:17.252 --> 02:04:24.794]  And basically, he and my father both understood what happened in 2014 with Maidan was a color revolution, right?
[02:04:25.874 --> 02:04:45.151]   We all remember this in the 2000s, Soros' fingerprints were all over these color revolutions in various former Soviet countries and also in North Africa, right, and Egypt and places like this, all these different Arab Springs, you know, color revolutions, and it was always being designed very much With the interests of the West, you know, in alignment with the interests of the West.
[02:04:45.231 --> 02:05:00.000]  So when it happened in 2014, Igor, as the director, and my father as the executive producer, you know, wanted to tell a story to explain to people that this is, you know, this could be a very dangerous situation because of Ukraine's history with vis-a-vis Russia.
[02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:04.622]  Russia in 2008, Putin said, Georgia and Ukraine cannot become NATO countries.
[02:05:04.783 --> 02:05:08.423]   They surrendered, you know, what, over a dozen new countries to NATO and, you know, since
[02:05:08.423 --> 02:05:12.582]   the fall of the Soviet Union when basically the West said, "We're not going to expand
[02:05:12.582 --> 02:05:13.583]  NATO.
[02:05:13.583 --> 02:05:14.583]  NATO is an anti-Russian organization."
[02:05:14.583 --> 02:05:15.583]  The Soviet Union had collapsed.
[02:05:15.583 --> 02:05:18.542]   Why are we pushing NATO further with against the weakened Russia?
[02:05:18.542 --> 02:05:20.622]  We should have probably just said, "Look, let's make peace.
[02:05:20.622 --> 02:05:25.142]   Let's work to have trade and various agreements to, you know, bring, stabilize the region."
[02:05:25.142 --> 02:05:28.103]  Instead, they continue to push armaments, right, arms sales.
[02:05:28.103 --> 02:05:31.981]   It's big money to, you know, promote, again, defense against Russia.
[02:05:31.981 --> 02:05:33.142]  And they kept pushing and pushing.
[02:05:33.142 --> 02:05:36.902]  Putin in 2008 said Georgia and Ukraine is a red line.
[02:05:36.902 --> 02:05:38.983]  But 2014 with the Maidan coup.
[02:05:39.698 --> 02:05:52.310]  Again, neo-Nazi factions involved, you know, they had snipers killing people and they basically blamed it on the Russians, but it seems that it was actually, no, it was probably those neo-Nazi factions that were the ones doing the sniping to then blame it on the Russians.
[02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:53.471]  Typical false flag, right?
[02:05:53.972 --> 02:06:16.468]   So again, 2014 is an important date, and my dad and Igor understood this, and the sequel documentary, Revealing Ukraine, It explains even more of what happened in the wake of that and how this anti-Russian agenda became solidified within the political climate of Ukraine in the last eight years and how much even the politician who is the second most popular politician, let's say,
[02:06:17.208 --> 02:06:23.090]  After Zelensky, who's been under house arrest, my father was interviewing this man, he was saying, look, we need to work with Russia.
[02:06:23.130 --> 02:06:23.870]  They're our neighbor.
[02:06:23.950 --> 02:06:24.910]  You know, we have history.
[02:06:24.990 --> 02:06:27.891]  We cannot isolate ourselves vis-a-vis Russia.
[02:06:27.931 --> 02:06:29.451]  This is a terrible policy for us.
[02:06:29.852 --> 02:06:34.513]  Again, as I said, it would be like Mexico cutting off America and saying, no, we're no longer trading with America.
[02:06:34.553 --> 02:06:35.373]  We're shutting you out.
[02:06:35.413 --> 02:06:39.394]  We're going to, you know, basically, you know, go with China from here on out.
[02:06:39.474 --> 02:06:42.175]  It would not be, it's not a good strategy for Ukraine to follow.
[02:06:42.922 --> 02:06:52.168]  And this is kind of like a, you know, a retweet doesn't equal endorsement thing, but, you know, this is what Americans don't really understand because the media is lying to them so much.
[02:06:53.209 --> 02:06:56.611]  Saudi Arabia doesn't want its country to be LGBTQ.
[02:06:57.271 --> 02:06:57.571]  Okay?
[02:06:57.650 --> 02:07:00.451]  Russia doesn't want its country to be LGBTQ.
[02:07:00.451 --> 02:07:05.150]   Egypt, people in Ukraine, all these other places, they're sick of Soros color revolutions
[02:07:05.150 --> 02:07:07.630]  coming in using social media giants to do this.
[02:07:07.630 --> 02:07:12.989]   And all of these countries are sick of corruption from American bureaucrats and politicians
[02:07:12.989 --> 02:07:17.791]   using their country for bribery, blackmail, money laundering, all this stuff.
[02:07:17.791 --> 02:07:21.110]   So Americans are really being lied to at the big picture here.
[02:07:21.546 --> 02:07:23.967]  The world is sick of corrupt American politicians.
[02:07:24.087 --> 02:07:25.848]  Again, retweet doesn't equal endorsement.
[02:07:25.868 --> 02:07:28.049]  I'm not saying China's good or all these other countries are good.
[02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:30.710]  I'm saying they're rejecting the Soros movement.
[02:07:31.070 --> 02:07:40.394]  They're rejecting, really, not Western expansionists going in and raising our flag, but politicians expanding their own wealth and power via expansion.
[02:07:40.755 --> 02:07:43.736]  This is the big lie that the media is not telling the American people.
[02:07:44.116 --> 02:07:44.536]  Absolutely.
[02:07:44.576 --> 02:07:52.478]  I mean, we, the problem is, as I've been saying with Russia, and my father's been saying it by doing the Putin interviews and talking to Putin, Putin called America his partner.
[02:07:52.498 --> 02:07:54.318]  He's like, we look to our partners in America.
[02:07:54.338 --> 02:07:55.899]  America never looks to Russia as a partner.
[02:07:56.119 --> 02:07:56.819]  I wish we had.
[02:07:56.899 --> 02:07:57.059]  Right?
[02:07:57.099 --> 02:07:57.959]  He's saying they're the enemy.
[02:07:58.059 --> 02:07:58.919]  Why are they the enemy?
[02:07:59.119 --> 02:08:00.180]  This is a great power.
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:03.020]  Why should we not have trade and respect for each other?
[02:08:03.100 --> 02:08:03.900]  It's just, it's insane.
[02:08:03.920 --> 02:08:06.341]  Imagine the alliance of Russia and U.S.
[02:08:06.881 --> 02:08:08.564]  They're a very similar country if you think about it.
[02:08:08.585 --> 02:08:16.840]  Multicultural, massive land mass, they have science, they're very intelligent, culturally intelligent, scientifically intelligent.
[02:08:17.341 --> 02:08:18.703]  It would be a natural alliance.
[02:08:19.525 --> 02:08:20.906]  Sean Stone is with us.
[02:08:20.946 --> 02:08:23.027]  He's going to be back with me on The War Room.
[02:08:23.247 --> 02:08:26.088]  Wayne Allyn Root taking over the Alex Jones Show right now.
[02:08:26.729 --> 02:08:27.849]  Alright, welcome to the show.
[02:08:27.889 --> 02:08:29.230]  Wayne Allyn Root is with you.
[02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:34.232]  Guest host on Tuesdays for Alex Jones and honored to be here with you.
[02:08:34.312 --> 02:08:38.634]  Fantastic audience, fantastic show, fantastic host Alex Jones.
[02:08:39.075 --> 02:08:40.756]  Great network and the content.
[02:08:40.856 --> 02:08:52.163]   Man, it's an honor to be with you because you don't get The real scoop anywhere else anymore but Wayne Root and Alex Jones and a few other rare shows across the United States of America.
[02:08:52.624 --> 02:09:13.702]   Last Tuesday, when I was on as guest host, I talked about the fact that it just come out last weekend that Newsmax and Fox News had taken huge money from the Biden administration for the federal government to not talk about all the deaths and injuries from the vaccine and never talk about The negative side effects of the vaccine.
[02:09:14.222 --> 02:09:15.665]  Only give positive information.
[02:09:16.146 --> 02:09:18.310]  Never allow hosts to ever say something bad.
[02:09:19.452 --> 02:09:20.434]  Never ask a question.
[02:09:21.630 --> 02:09:27.532]  And most importantly, never even allow a guest on who would say something negative about the vaccine.
[02:09:27.592 --> 02:09:35.934]  So it's apropos, I think, that I'm guest hosting again this Tuesday and leading off with that news because I want to make sure you understand the significance of it.
[02:09:36.294 --> 02:09:37.755]  I've been saying this for a long time.
[02:09:38.195 --> 02:09:41.196]  This is a communist takeover of the United States.
[02:09:41.676 --> 02:09:43.496]  What is the hallmark of communism?
[02:09:44.096 --> 02:09:46.197]  No dissent allowed.
[02:09:46.869 --> 02:09:57.872]  No one is allowed to say, I don't agree with the leader, I don't agree with the tyrant, I don't agree with the persecution of people of dissent, or you get taken off to the gulag.
[02:09:58.392 --> 02:10:03.013]  You get banned for life, as I was, by the way, banned for life by Twitter.
[02:10:03.574 --> 02:10:12.976]  A great badge of honor, banned for life by Twitter made headlines all over the world, front of the UK Daily Mail and several other newspapers in England and around the world.
[02:10:12.996 --> 02:10:16.097]  Donald Trump's friend, Wayne Allyn Root, banned for life.
[02:10:16.718 --> 02:10:17.278]  By Twitter.
[02:10:18.138 --> 02:10:20.579]  So this is the period we're in.
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:23.020]  It's like, you know, Goebbels.
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:24.781]  It's like the Gestapo.
[02:10:24.841 --> 02:10:29.662]  It's like the Soviet gulag and the KGB and the East German Stasi.
[02:10:30.323 --> 02:10:32.223]  You can't get the truth from the news.
[02:10:32.924 --> 02:10:36.345]  So I have argued and I'll make this case throughout today's hour.
[02:10:37.385 --> 02:10:39.786]  I have argued again and again and again.
[02:10:41.411 --> 02:10:47.499]  On my national radio show, Wayne Allyn Root, raw.net, filtered on USA Radio Network every afternoon, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:10:47.940 --> 02:10:50.042]  West Coast time, 6 to 9 p.m.
[02:10:50.203 --> 02:10:53.206]  East Coast time, 5 to 8 Central time.
[02:10:53.587 --> 02:10:58.053]  Check it out at usaradio.com or my website, rootforamerica.com.
[02:10:58.773 --> 02:11:05.276]  Or, how about Odyssey, the world's biggest streaming app, now took my show, the Wayne Allyn Root Show, about a month ago.
[02:11:05.397 --> 02:11:06.777]  Big, big, big happening for us.
[02:11:07.177 --> 02:11:11.019]  So every day on Odyssey, on your phone, you can listen to the Wayne Allyn Root Show.
[02:11:11.280 --> 02:11:22.225]  But I argue three hours a day that what's happening today, you can't believe a word about Ukraine and Russia, you can't believe anything going on in the media, because they lie about everything.
[02:11:22.265 --> 02:11:30.131]   The same people that lied to you about the rigged election And continue to lie to you and make believe it never happened.
[02:11:30.151 --> 02:11:33.434]  And if you talk about it, you should be banned for life or put in prison.
[02:11:33.855 --> 02:11:34.976]  Just like the Soviet Union.
[02:11:35.316 --> 02:11:36.457]  Just like Nazi Germany.
[02:11:37.058 --> 02:11:37.698]  And I'm a Jew.
[02:11:37.798 --> 02:11:38.759]  I can say that.
[02:11:39.220 --> 02:11:41.242]  Let's see the media come after me.
[02:11:42.014 --> 02:11:45.536]  A Jew for saying that this reminds me of Nazi Germany.
[02:11:45.877 --> 02:11:49.579]  The way the unvaccinated were treated reminds me of Nazi Germany.
[02:11:49.919 --> 02:11:53.342]  The vaccine passports remind me of the Gestapo.
[02:11:53.922 --> 02:12:02.288]  And now the news media and the lies for the last two years of COVID and the lies of the rigged election and the banning of talking about it.
[02:12:02.648 --> 02:12:06.370]  And now I think the lies of the Ukraine-Russian war.
[02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:07.251]  By the way, it's real.
[02:12:07.671 --> 02:12:08.352]  COVID was real.
[02:12:08.933 --> 02:12:10.721]  And what's going on in Ukraine is real.
[02:12:10.742 --> 02:12:11.385]  It's not made up.
[02:12:11.405 --> 02:12:12.128]  They're not acting.
[02:12:12.751 --> 02:12:14.693]  There's an invasion by Russia.
[02:12:15.193 --> 02:12:17.074]  They've got objectives, got nothing to do with us.
[02:12:17.655 --> 02:12:38.631]  But now you have people saying out loud, if you say that it's not that bad, if you say the media's lying, if you say maybe we shouldn't get involved, if you say we shouldn't be on Ukraine's side, if you say some of the scenes you see on TV could be staged, you don't know what to believe because they lied so much about COVID and so much about the rigged election.
[02:12:39.151 --> 02:12:41.293]  They say you should be put in prison.
[02:12:41.974 --> 02:12:43.275]  Or fined or banned!
[02:12:44.055 --> 02:12:53.302]  This has never happened in the history of America that a person trying to honestly look at a situation and keep America out of war and keep your children safe.
[02:12:53.842 --> 02:12:54.642]  I have two sons.
[02:12:55.043 --> 02:12:58.205]  I don't want them going anywhere near World War III over Ukraine.
[02:12:58.805 --> 02:13:01.367]  I don't want my kids dying or coming home crippled.
[02:13:01.977 --> 02:13:04.318]  Okay, I've had friends and I've had fans.
[02:13:04.398 --> 02:13:06.238]  I visited at Walter Reed Hospital.
[02:13:06.598 --> 02:13:08.119]  I've seen what war does.
[02:13:08.779 --> 02:13:11.080]  And I don't want my kids happening to them or yours.
[02:13:11.780 --> 02:13:12.440]  All right, I'm back.
[02:13:12.700 --> 02:13:14.421]  Wayne Allyn Root is with you, guest host.
[02:13:14.941 --> 02:13:18.502]  By the way, my website, rootforamerica.com.
[02:13:19.202 --> 02:13:21.823]  And you can email me anytime, wingroot at gmail.com.
[02:13:21.863 --> 02:13:22.664]  I love to hear from you.
[02:13:23.004 --> 02:13:26.646]  Tell the same thing to all my fans on my three-hour daily national radio show.
[02:13:27.366 --> 02:13:29.827]  There is my website, rootforamerica.com.
[02:13:30.167 --> 02:13:36.650]  Here's my book, The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book, which I think is one of the answers.
[02:13:37.231 --> 02:13:38.331]  I've got a lot of solutions.
[02:13:38.351 --> 02:13:39.552]  This is one of the answers.
[02:13:40.072 --> 02:13:54.781]  For how we fight back, it's about civil disobedience, it's about strikes and protests and boycotts and blockades and all the things we need to do that Dr. Martin Luther King did in the 1960s that won civil rights for black Americans, we as conservatives need to do.
[02:13:54.841 --> 02:13:56.281]  We're the ones being persecuted now.
[02:13:56.622 --> 02:14:01.064]  The civil rights issue of this century is persecution of conservatives.
[02:14:01.504 --> 02:14:15.025]   I remember years ago, 15 years ago I gave a speech in San Francisco and I said it's great to be here in San Francisco in front of people in a city where you can come out of the closet, you can be openly gay, but you got to be a closet conservative?
[02:14:15.996 --> 02:14:17.056]  And the crowd laughed!
[02:14:17.096 --> 02:14:18.137]  They thought that was hilarious.
[02:14:18.497 --> 02:14:19.477]  That was 15 years ago.
[02:14:19.517 --> 02:14:20.257]  Now it's come true.
[02:14:20.637 --> 02:14:23.138]  But I think we've got to fight back, because we are the persecuted ones.
[02:14:24.519 --> 02:14:28.340]  Conservatives, capitalists, patriots who love America.
[02:14:28.740 --> 02:14:30.320]  And how about a specific subset?
[02:14:30.900 --> 02:14:32.661]  White, straight males.
[02:14:33.021 --> 02:14:35.083]  Who are Republicans and who are macho.
[02:14:35.403 --> 02:14:36.344]  My God, they hate us.
[02:14:36.665 --> 02:14:37.586]  They want to destroy us.
[02:14:37.886 --> 02:14:39.167]  They don't want our kids going to college.
[02:14:39.488 --> 02:14:40.589]  They don't want us getting jobs.
[02:14:40.829 --> 02:14:42.430]  They want to kill our careers and our businesses.
[02:14:42.831 --> 02:14:46.635]  It's the most incredible persecution of critical race theory.
[02:14:46.675 --> 02:14:50.859]  My God, teaching children to hate themselves because they're white and they're inferior because they're white.
[02:14:51.119 --> 02:14:51.480]  Terrible.
[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:51.780]  Anyway.
[02:14:52.532 --> 02:14:55.095]  Here's the book, The Great Patriot Protested Boycott Book.
[02:14:55.395 --> 02:15:12.653]  It is a resource guide in addition to a book in the backs of 120 corporations that screw over conservatives and the name of the CEO and information in the book, the phone number, the email, the social media and the physical address so you can go after them and let them know we're boycotting you until you stop this liberal crap.
[02:15:13.664 --> 02:15:16.885]  All right, so this is a nice long stretch in this segment.
[02:15:17.266 --> 02:15:20.607]  Gives me a chance to read my commentary that's coming out this weekend.
[02:15:20.627 --> 02:15:26.410]  Normally I don't even write it till Thursday afternoon or Friday morning, but I'm leaving tomorrow for my honeymoon.
[02:15:26.830 --> 02:15:28.050]  I'm going to Mar-a-Lago.
[02:15:28.090 --> 02:15:28.591]  Can you imagine?
[02:15:28.631 --> 02:15:33.733]   I'm spending a week At Donald Trump's amazing fairytale estate with my new wife Cindy.
[02:15:34.174 --> 02:15:36.835]  And we leave tomorrow morning at very early in the morning.
[02:15:36.895 --> 02:15:38.656]  So I had to write it this morning.
[02:15:38.676 --> 02:15:40.877]  I got up at 5 in the morning to write it.
[02:15:41.237 --> 02:15:43.579]  And it'll be out this weekend in newspapers around the country.
[02:15:43.919 --> 02:15:44.839]  Nationally syndicated.
[02:15:44.859 --> 02:15:45.560]  I want you to hear it.
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:47.841]  You're the first to hear it in America.
[02:15:47.881 --> 02:15:50.202]  The fans of the Alex Jones Show from Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:15:50.602 --> 02:15:55.365]  The title is, has one rigged election destroyed America forever?
[02:15:55.845 --> 02:15:57.466]  The odds are not good.
[02:15:58.267 --> 02:15:58.807]  So here it is.
[02:15:59.477 --> 02:16:01.198]  Folks, we are in a world of trouble.
[02:16:01.839 --> 02:16:03.720]  America has faced tough odds before.
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:06.662]  America beats impossible odds all the time.
[02:16:07.162 --> 02:16:11.105]  We are relentless and resilient and tenacious.
[02:16:11.566 --> 02:16:15.388]  We're a nation of people who believe nothing is impossible.
[02:16:15.769 --> 02:16:18.691]  We constantly make the impossible possible.
[02:16:19.131 --> 02:16:20.432]  So never count us out.
[02:16:20.932 --> 02:16:21.513]  There is hope.
[02:16:22.453 --> 02:16:29.058]  But make no mistake, we are now in the fight of our lives and the odds may be worse than we have ever faced.
[02:16:29.722 --> 02:16:31.624]  Our nation is being destroyed from within.
[02:16:32.284 --> 02:16:34.126]  America is hanging by a thread.
[02:16:34.746 --> 02:16:37.769]  The attacks are relentless and ominous.
[02:16:38.450 --> 02:16:40.712]  The nation is divided like never before.
[02:16:41.232 --> 02:16:48.358]  You'd have to go back to the Civil War to find any other period in our nation's history where we are this bitterly divided.
[02:16:49.159 --> 02:16:54.003]  Our borders are wide open with millions of foreign invaders coming in every year.
[02:16:54.684 --> 02:16:56.145]  There's some scenes up on the screen.
[02:16:56.795 --> 02:17:05.943]  The bad countries of the world are emptying out their prisons to send their worst criminals to us to make them our headache, to make them our expense.
[02:17:06.604 --> 02:17:22.698]  Illegal aliens by the millions are bringing poverty, disease, and violent crime, bloating our budget, exploding our national debt, and destroying our education system, our healthcare system, and our social security system.
[02:17:23.479 --> 02:17:31.327]  Inflation is raging like never before in modern history, maybe like never before in the entire history of the United States.
[02:17:31.407 --> 02:17:36.632]  No one really knows how bad it is, exactly, and no one really knows how bad it's going to get.
[02:17:37.173 --> 02:17:40.116]  But the government is hiding the true level of inflation.
[02:17:40.916 --> 02:17:49.040]  A more accurate measurement of inflation puts us in the 15% to 20% or more range right now.
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:51.021]  And it's only going to get worse.
[02:17:51.601 --> 02:17:55.423]  This has the potential to wipe out the great American middle class.
[02:17:56.603 --> 02:18:05.627]  If and when gas gets to $10 a gallon or higher, some experts are suggesting it could go to $15 a gallon, the U.S.
[02:18:05.687 --> 02:18:07.288]  economy will be at the point of collapse.
[02:18:08.203 --> 02:18:18.829]  What working class or middle class person will be able to drive to work or play or vacation when it costs $200 or more to fill up one tank of gas?
[02:18:19.250 --> 02:18:20.971]  Can you imagine if it went to $15 a gallon?
[02:18:21.271 --> 02:18:23.252]  It would cost you $300 to fill up a tank of gas.
[02:18:25.638 --> 02:18:35.884]  What will happen to 3.5 million American truckers who each drive thousands of miles a week if they can't get the food or goods to market?
[02:18:36.304 --> 02:18:39.445]  Our nation collapses into Mad Max territory.
[02:18:39.465 --> 02:18:41.727]  Remember that movie from 40 years ago?
[02:18:41.767 --> 02:18:48.290]  I think Mad Max with Mel Gibson roaming a post-apocalyptic world after, I think, a nuclear attack.
[02:18:49.010 --> 02:18:49.871]  That's what it would look like.
[02:18:49.911 --> 02:18:51.612]  It's every man or woman for themselves.
[02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:56.312]  But the best case scenario, the best, the worst is Mad Max.
[02:18:56.772 --> 02:19:04.958]  The best case scenario is the truckers continue to deliver the goods and the food, but prices double or triple from where they are now.
[02:19:05.418 --> 02:19:06.078]  Already high.
[02:19:06.519 --> 02:19:07.800]  There's Mad Max right there.
[02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:08.760]  You guys are great.
[02:19:09.161 --> 02:19:10.722]  I love the B-roll you guys put up.
[02:19:11.002 --> 02:19:11.782]  There's Mad Max.
[02:19:12.383 --> 02:19:14.724]  I haven't even gotten to the worst scenarios yet.
[02:19:15.665 --> 02:19:19.968]  But the point is, a rigged election has changed everything.
[02:19:20.791 --> 02:19:22.732]  Let's do a little run down memory lane.
[02:19:23.193 --> 02:19:26.215]  Think of America with Donald J. Trump as president.
[02:19:26.255 --> 02:19:26.835]  I'll see him.
[02:19:27.275 --> 02:19:31.738]  I'll see him hopefully tomorrow night for dinner and throughout the week in Mar-a-Lago on my honeymoon.
[02:19:31.798 --> 02:19:33.099]  Thank you, President Trump.
[02:19:33.119 --> 02:19:36.041]  But think of America with Trump as president.
[02:19:37.082 --> 02:19:38.122]  Things were great.
[02:19:38.743 --> 02:19:45.167]  We had perhaps the greatest and most prosperous economy in history, the highest increase in middle class incomes ever.
[02:19:45.842 --> 02:19:47.743]  The lowest unemployment ever!
[02:19:48.163 --> 02:19:50.985]  Including the lowest black and Latino unemployment ever!
[02:19:51.445 --> 02:19:54.267]  Inflation and interest rates at historic lows!
[02:19:54.827 --> 02:19:58.109]  A perfect supply chain with a plethora of everything.
[02:19:58.529 --> 02:20:02.411]  Anything you wanted in the world, you got in prosperous Trump America.
[02:20:02.832 --> 02:20:04.593]  And we had peace all over the world.
[02:20:05.173 --> 02:20:08.435]  But some Americans didn't like Donald Trump's tweets.
[02:20:09.475 --> 02:20:12.317]  What would you give to have Trump back right about now?
[02:20:13.448 --> 02:20:15.751]  One rigged election has changed everything.
[02:20:16.232 --> 02:20:24.242]  American exceptionalism, capitalism, our economy, your job, your future earning power, your children's future, your freedoms, peace on earth!
[02:20:25.023 --> 02:20:26.084]  It's all at risk now.
[02:20:26.665 --> 02:20:28.748]  It could all go to hell at any moment.
[02:20:29.503 --> 02:20:48.377]  All because we allow Democrats to rig a presidential election with millions of fake mail-in ballots tied to no voter ID, tied to little or no signature matching, plus an insane idea called ballot harvesting that used to be illegal in all 50 states and isn't legal anywhere else in the world.
[02:20:48.858 --> 02:20:54.122]  Ballot drops in the middle of the night of 100,000 to basically zero for Biden.
[02:20:54.742 --> 02:21:09.251]  Ballots counted for days after the election until the desired result was achieved by Democrats and after every Republican witness possible was kicked out of every counting room while the votes were being counted in key battleground states.
[02:21:10.392 --> 02:21:12.113]  No evidence of a rigged election there, huh?
[02:21:12.373 --> 02:21:13.094]  We're all crazy.
[02:21:13.866 --> 02:21:18.029]  Now to the potential life or death problems that we face because we allowed a rigged election.
[02:21:18.429 --> 02:21:22.632]  We face the real possibility of World War III with the Ukraine-Russia war.
[02:21:23.172 --> 02:21:26.915]  Are you ready to let your sons and daughters die for Ukraine?
[02:21:27.475 --> 02:21:28.056]  I know I'm not.
[02:21:28.896 --> 02:21:31.078]  We face the real possibility of a nuclear war.
[02:21:31.538 --> 02:21:34.220]  We are closer than at any time in modern history.
[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:36.842]  Even the United Nations announced that days ago.
[02:21:37.461 --> 02:21:44.743]  We're about to sign the Iran Treaty, the worst deal in world history that hands nuclear weapons to the worst terrorist nation in the world.
[02:21:45.343 --> 02:21:51.184]  China's almost certain to invade Taiwan, which makes 95% of the crucial chips in the world.
[02:21:51.524 --> 02:21:56.385]  Without them, we can't operate our computers, our cell phones, our cars, our refrigerators, our ovens.
[02:21:56.765 --> 02:22:13.329]   And then as a bonus, we face financial collapse if we can't get enough gas to fill our gas tanks, if the Russian money we just banned from our financial system undermines credit markets and causes the entire banking system to collapse and if our dollar collapses as the world's reserve currency.
[02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:16.750]  These disasters are all on the table at this minute.
[02:22:17.191 --> 02:22:19.431]  But what if several converge at the same time?
[02:22:20.052 --> 02:22:25.453]  At that point, our country, your life, your children's future could be gone forever.
[02:22:25.893 --> 02:22:26.614]  Just like that.
[02:22:27.134 --> 02:22:30.475]  All because we allowed a rig election in the United States of America.
[02:22:30.495 --> 02:22:32.315]  Who are you going to vote for in November?
[02:22:32.796 --> 02:22:36.179]   If you vote Democrat, You're officially suicidal.
[02:22:37.100 --> 02:22:37.560]  P.S.
[02:22:38.200 --> 02:22:39.121]  Let's go, Brandon.
[02:22:40.142 --> 02:22:42.023]  That's my column that's coming out this weekend.
[02:22:42.383 --> 02:22:44.104]  Nationally syndicated by Creator Syndicate.
[02:22:44.444 --> 02:22:46.826]  Has one rigged election destroyed America forever?
[02:22:47.286 --> 02:22:48.887]  The odds are against us.
[02:22:49.267 --> 02:22:52.469]  I'm Wayne Allyn Root, guest host today for Alex Jones.

[02:24:01.401 --> 02:24:02.341]  Thank you, Donald Trump.
[02:24:02.401 --> 02:24:03.682]  Trump Rules was the book I wrote.
[02:24:04.462 --> 02:24:11.769]  To honor all those ideals and habits that he taught me that made me successful, and you can use the same habits and ideals, Trump rules.
[02:24:12.430 --> 02:24:16.974]  And you also get all my commentaries and all my video commentaries and all my video podcasts.

[02:24:19.336 --> 02:24:22.399]  You can email me anytime, wayneroot at gmail.com.
[02:24:22.879 --> 02:24:25.502]  All right, some things in the news that I think are important for you.
[02:24:26.201 --> 02:24:33.880]   Pfizer and the FDA hid data showing that their clinical trials failed, says former Black
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:35.742]  Rock advisor.
[02:24:35.742 --> 02:24:40.361]   So this was an interview, I mean, this is really important stuff, with Naomi Wolf.
[02:24:40.361 --> 02:24:46.040]   And by the way, Donald Trump is leading a lawsuit against big tech, social media, Silicon
[02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:50.361]   Valley, that they censured us, that they banned us, that they're terrible people and they've
[02:24:50.361 --> 02:24:53.201]   done awful things to conservatives and they're biased and prejudiced.
[02:24:53.786 --> 02:24:57.447]  And that lawsuit has, I don't know, I think 50,000 people attached to it.
[02:24:57.887 --> 02:25:05.733]   But two lead plaintiffs, Wayne Allyn Root, me, and Naomi Wolf, Dr. Naomi Wolf, I'm from the right, and she's from the left.
[02:25:06.134 --> 02:25:11.140]  But we both agree that they've done terrible censoring and banning of important information.
[02:25:11.481 --> 02:25:15.205]  Not only not misinformation, but information you need to save your life.
[02:25:15.706 --> 02:25:16.387]  And they've banned it.
[02:25:16.940 --> 02:25:30.225]  And so here's Naomi Wolf, and she did an interview yesterday with a former BlackRock investment advisor who is a billionaire, Edward Dowd, and he explained why all the vaccine company stocks are crashing on Wall Street.
[02:25:31.025 --> 02:25:32.425]  One of them is down 80 percent.
[02:25:32.766 --> 02:25:34.306]  I believe another one's down 40 percent.
[02:25:34.326 --> 02:25:36.087]  Another one's down 20 percent.
[02:25:36.527 --> 02:25:39.368]  Why are the vaccine drug companies flailing?
[02:25:40.470 --> 02:25:42.231]  And collapsing on Wall Street.
[02:25:42.751 --> 02:25:47.653]  And the answer is they know that the vaccines are killing people.
[02:25:48.013 --> 02:25:49.953]  They know the vaccines are maiming people.
[02:25:50.273 --> 02:25:52.114]  They know the vaccines are crippling people.
[02:25:52.454 --> 02:25:55.055]  They know the vaccines are ruining people's lives.
[02:25:55.455 --> 02:25:56.936]  And they know it's all coming out.
[02:25:57.396 --> 02:25:58.176]  It's spilling out.
[02:25:58.596 --> 02:26:00.477]  Their trials were a disaster.
[02:26:00.877 --> 02:26:02.758]  But they hid them from the public.
[02:26:03.058 --> 02:26:06.899]  And they tried to hide them for 75 years.
[02:26:07.540 --> 02:26:08.460]  And that's what they were going to do.
[02:26:10.572 --> 02:26:14.355]  And then a court came along, a federal judge, and he said, you got to release them.
[02:26:14.836 --> 02:26:16.837]  I think it's 50,000 pages a month.
[02:26:17.178 --> 02:26:21.201]  So it's still going to take years to release all the pages of their clinical trials.
[02:26:21.641 --> 02:26:25.504]  But so far, what we've seen indicates they were a massive failure.
[02:26:25.885 --> 02:26:30.869]  And this drug, this vaccine should have never been approved in a million years.
[02:26:32.486 --> 02:26:34.449]  And so here's what Dowd is saying.
[02:26:34.469 --> 02:26:40.115]  This guy, his name is Edward Dowd, and he's a billionaire and a former BlackRock investment advisor.
[02:26:40.656 --> 02:26:49.427]  He described how the initial caution about taking the experimental COVID vaccine led him to research data related to Pfizer's clinical trials.
[02:26:50.234 --> 02:26:57.681]  And he learned from a friend in the biotech industry that Pfizer had failed in its all-cause mortality endpoint in the trial.
[02:26:58.242 --> 02:27:03.206]  All-cause mortality is the gold standard in any drug trial at the FDA.
[02:27:03.527 --> 02:27:06.750]  And if you fail the endpoint, the drug is never approved.
[02:27:07.150 --> 02:27:15.318]  But they failed and they pushed the vaccine through anyway, despite the deaths, despite the horrible side effects.
[02:27:15.638 --> 02:27:24.034]  Despite the permanent injuries, despite the disabling injuries, and then they tried to hide the critical data for 75 years.
[02:27:27.091 --> 02:27:53.518]   And then this guy Dow talks about something I've talked about on my national radio show and on Alex Jones Show and everywhere I go for many, many months, but real people, serious Wall Street people are beginning to talk about this and get scared about it, which is funeral homes and the directors of funeral homes, funeral directors, And insurance companies, life insurance companies, are all reporting that deaths are skyrocketing!
[02:27:53.918 --> 02:27:57.540]  They're up 40% across the United States of America.
[02:27:57.980 --> 02:27:59.721]  Deaths are up 40%!
[02:28:00.081 --> 02:28:10.386]  Heart attacks, strokes, multi-organ failure, all the ways of dying that are side effects of the vaccine, and nobody wants to say it!
[02:28:10.786 --> 02:28:11.987]  That it's the vaccine!
[02:28:12.768 --> 02:28:13.869]  How would James Carville say it?
[02:28:14.249 --> 02:28:15.771]  It's the vaccine, stupid!
[02:28:16.211 --> 02:28:17.632]  How could you not see that?
[02:28:18.433 --> 02:28:20.695]  Never have people died like they're dying now.
[02:28:21.195 --> 02:28:23.157]  Never have athletes dropped of heart attacks.
[02:28:23.537 --> 02:28:31.544]  Never have you seen a four-year-old child get a heart attack and die 14 days after getting the vaccine for COVID.
[02:28:31.924 --> 02:28:34.407]  Never in history have you seen anything like this.
[02:28:34.807 --> 02:28:42.552]   And then you've got Thomas Renz, a wonderful class action lawyer, who's suing The United States government and the military and the Department of Defense.
[02:28:43.173 --> 02:28:44.374]  Because they're hiding.
[02:28:44.674 --> 02:28:48.719]  He's got whistleblowers who brought the real statistics on floppy disks.
[02:28:49.019 --> 02:28:51.542]  They grabbed them before they got erased by the government.
[02:28:51.582 --> 02:28:52.303]  They've been erased.
[02:28:52.683 --> 02:28:54.024]  Which shows you pure fraud!
[02:28:54.465 --> 02:28:55.866]  They're covering up the deaths!
[02:28:56.207 --> 02:28:57.648]  They're covering up the illnesses!
[02:28:57.869 --> 02:28:59.851]  They're covering up the permanent disabilities!
[02:29:01.431 --> 02:29:19.003]  And so Thomas Wren says what he's seen in these Department of Defense files from these whistleblowers who took them from the government before they could be erased is every injury imaginable that's a vaccine side effect up 200%, 300%, 500%, 1000% in the year 2021, the first year they gave vaccines.
[02:29:18.822 --> 02:29:25.661]   500%, 1000% in the year 2021, the first year they gave vaccines.
[02:29:25.661 --> 02:29:29.001]  There's no other reason why deaths are up like this.
[02:29:29.001 --> 02:29:34.001]   Ask any life insurance company in America and across the world, deaths are skyrocketing.
[02:29:34.109 --> 02:29:39.851]  And there's no other reason it would happen, except it all happened in the first year of the vaccines.
[02:29:40.831 --> 02:29:49.833]  And Pfizer held back all that information, and the US government, the Department of Defense, evidently, allegedly, is erasing that information.
[02:29:49.873 --> 02:29:54.794]  By the way, everything I say on this show, and my show, and every show, I'm an opinion guy.
[02:29:55.234 --> 02:29:56.674]  I'm a common sense guy.
[02:29:57.054 --> 02:30:16.926]  I'm a gut instinct guy, and let me state, it's my opinion that these are all public figures, public information, and I'm an opinion guy, and in a free speech country, you have a right to give your opinion, even if it's a sense with the government, and even if the government doesn't like it, and even if it's different than the media, and the media doesn't like it, tough!
[02:30:17.527 --> 02:30:18.347]  It's my opinion.
[02:30:18.968 --> 02:30:21.529]  Something very, very bad is going on.
[02:30:22.190 --> 02:30:24.331]  And speaking of bad going on, we have just a minute to go.
[02:30:24.969 --> 02:30:33.715]  Let me just give you a preview of what I'll have to talk about in the second half of this hour, this Wayne Root hour as guest host for Alex Jones, the great Alex Jones.
[02:30:34.315 --> 02:30:38.377]  Inflation, more proof that inflation is raging.
[02:30:38.758 --> 02:30:43.661]  It's the biggest possible tax increase on you and the middle class and small business.
[02:30:43.781 --> 02:30:44.681]  It is a nightmare.
[02:30:45.122 --> 02:30:51.306]  If I told you we're raising your taxes by 20 percent overnight, you get to keep 20 percent less your own money.
[02:30:51.586 --> 02:30:53.347]  You'd go, my God, I can't survive that.
[02:30:54.153 --> 02:30:56.694]  Well, inflation is up about 20 percent.
[02:30:57.055 --> 02:30:58.976]  You've got 20 percent less spending money.
[02:30:59.356 --> 02:31:01.637]  When you look at your bank account, it's inflated.
[02:31:01.657 --> 02:31:03.859]  You have 20 percent less money than you're seeing.
[02:31:04.179 --> 02:31:07.340]  And when you spend at the store, it's up 20 percent.
[02:31:07.681 --> 02:31:20.528]  So I'll have more information about that and the government watching everything we do and calling us extremists and domestic terrorists for merely telling the truth, asking questions and passing on pertinent information.
[02:31:20.908 --> 02:31:23.650]  We're becoming like a Nazi Russian police state.
[02:31:23.690 --> 02:31:24.351]  I'll be right back.
[02:31:24.751 --> 02:31:28.034]  Wayne Allyn Root, guest host for Alex Jones today.
[02:31:28.054 --> 02:31:30.155]  All right, Wayne Allyn Root, welcome back.
[02:31:30.195 --> 02:31:35.239]  Guest host today from 12 to 1 o'clock West Coast time for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:31:35.279 --> 02:31:39.142]  That, of course, means 3 o'clock to 4 o'clock East Coast time.
[02:31:39.263 --> 02:31:40.904]  Wayne Allyn Root, it's war time!
[02:31:41.304 --> 02:31:43.386]  The Root, the Root, the Root's on fire!
[02:31:44.156 --> 02:31:45.097]  And so's the country.
[02:31:45.478 --> 02:31:46.379]  And so's the world.
[02:31:46.739 --> 02:31:52.006]  Unfortunately, under Joe Biden, otherwise known, I call him O'Biden, because it's the Obama administration.
[02:31:52.066 --> 02:31:54.169]  Third term of the Obama administration.
[02:31:54.209 --> 02:31:57.173]  And Obama, in my opinion, is the real President of the United States.
[02:31:57.453 --> 02:31:58.995]  You know, I was in San Diego over the weekend.
[02:31:59.814 --> 02:32:02.656]  I gave a speech at the Re-Awaken America Tour.
[02:32:03.156 --> 02:32:08.280]  It was myself and General Flynn and Eric Trump, among a few others.
[02:32:08.740 --> 02:32:12.342]  And then I had a two-hour line for my book signing and photographs.
[02:32:12.983 --> 02:32:13.923]  And what an audience!
[02:32:14.023 --> 02:32:17.505]  About 3,000 people at the Awaken Church in San Diego.
[02:32:18.126 --> 02:32:19.607]  And I got a standing ovation.
[02:32:19.647 --> 02:32:20.868]  And you know why I got a standing ovation?
[02:32:21.268 --> 02:32:23.109]  Because I told people the truth.
[02:32:23.149 --> 02:32:24.650]  Wherever I go, I tell the truth.
[02:32:25.302 --> 02:32:28.184]  I tell him the truth that, you know, the media thought they killed Trump.
[02:32:28.204 --> 02:32:28.665]  He's gone.
[02:32:28.745 --> 02:32:29.245]  He's finished.
[02:32:29.285 --> 02:32:29.785]  He's ruined.
[02:32:30.346 --> 02:32:31.987]  Especially after January 6th.
[02:32:32.387 --> 02:32:32.868]  He's ruined.
[02:32:33.268 --> 02:32:34.168]  And we love him!
[02:32:34.188 --> 02:32:36.010]  And he's bigger than ever before.
[02:32:36.490 --> 02:32:38.972]  And I told the audience, he's one thing I know in life.
[02:32:39.622 --> 02:33:01.750]  I know my name is Wayne Allyn Root, as much as I know that, as much as I know the day I was born and where I was born and my social security number, as much as I know how much I love my kids and my wife Cindy, as much as I know that, I know in every single part of my body, in my bones, in my blood, in my capillaries, in my veins, that we won the election in 2020.
[02:33:02.391 --> 02:33:04.431]  Donald Trump is the real President of the United States.
[02:33:04.731 --> 02:33:06.012]  Standing ovation!
[02:33:06.752 --> 02:33:11.388]   And I know that Joe Biden is the illegitimate President of the United States, he is not my president.
[02:33:11.689 --> 02:33:12.931]  Standing ovation!
[02:33:13.332 --> 02:33:15.435]  The crowd loves it when you tell the truth.
[02:33:16.637 --> 02:33:17.619]  It was a rigged election.
[02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:19.840]  And it doesn't take a brain surgeon.
[02:33:19.860 --> 02:33:21.641]  I'm not blaming Dominion.
[02:33:21.661 --> 02:33:25.682]  I'm not coming up with any ideas that could be considered crazy.
[02:33:26.162 --> 02:33:27.802]  It was so simple what they did.
[02:33:28.082 --> 02:33:29.323]  And maybe they did other things.
[02:33:29.663 --> 02:33:31.003]  Maybe others were involved.
[02:33:31.463 --> 02:33:36.985]  I just never got involved in the Dominion talk and the changing of votes on machines via computer.
[02:33:37.405 --> 02:33:42.246]  The only thing I ever got involved in is, hey, Trump was winning every state he had to.
[02:33:42.978 --> 02:33:45.341]  Trump was winning every bellwether county in America.
[02:33:45.841 --> 02:33:49.165]  Trump was winning every vote that mattered, every battleground state.
[02:33:49.445 --> 02:33:54.271]  And then at midnight, for the first time in the history of America, they stopped counting.
[02:33:54.731 --> 02:33:56.493]  And they said, we'll pick it up in the morning.
[02:33:56.793 --> 02:34:00.758]  And when you woke up in the morning, they had already picked it up and said that Biden's the winner.
[02:34:01.913 --> 02:34:05.857]  And they found hundreds of thousands of new votes out of thin air, all for Biden.
[02:34:06.257 --> 02:34:07.078]  None for Trump.
[02:34:07.478 --> 02:34:09.400]  Oh, that's not a problem.
[02:34:09.840 --> 02:34:17.046]  All based on COVID and the fact that they changed the law in all these battleground states to allow mail-in ballots.
[02:34:17.546 --> 02:34:20.449]  And they found them under their desk in suitcases.
[02:34:20.769 --> 02:34:24.212]  And they found them in vans in the middle of the night, delivered to voting centers.
[02:34:24.492 --> 02:34:26.014]  And they kicked all the witnesses out.
[02:34:26.314 --> 02:34:28.776]  And suddenly Biden was the winner, not Trump.
[02:34:30.231 --> 02:34:30.871]  It's hilarious.
[02:34:31.051 --> 02:34:37.873]  And then they, wait, not only is that, if you're not a total complete moron, is that not evidence and proof that the election was stolen?
[02:34:38.193 --> 02:34:43.155]  You're an idiot if you don't believe that that tells you the election was mass fraud and the election was stolen.
[02:34:43.195 --> 02:34:51.997]  But on top of that, on top of that, the fact that they now tell you if you talk about it, you should be banned for life.
[02:34:52.637 --> 02:34:55.918]  If you talk about it, you shouldn't be able to talk anymore.
[02:34:56.787 --> 02:34:59.049]  I should lose my show for talking about it!
[02:34:59.609 --> 02:35:00.430]  In America?
[02:35:01.771 --> 02:35:02.051]  What?
[02:35:03.052 --> 02:35:08.675]  Didn't the Democrats talk about the election was stolen by Trump in 16 and Russian collusion day and night?
[02:35:08.916 --> 02:35:11.077]  And weren't they proven to be complete liars?
[02:35:11.317 --> 02:35:13.199]  And it was a fraud made up by Hillary Clinton?
[02:35:14.159 --> 02:35:15.821]  And nobody told them they should be banned?
[02:35:16.161 --> 02:35:19.803]  Nobody ever banned them from Twitter or Facebook or social media?
[02:35:21.484 --> 02:35:27.909]   But if a Republican talks about a stolen election, You're a horrible person and you've got to be ixnayed from society!
[02:35:29.049 --> 02:35:32.310]  That's all you need to know to prove the election was stolen.
[02:35:32.570 --> 02:35:36.671]  That we're not allowed to talk about it while the FBI knocks on your door.
[02:35:38.352 --> 02:35:39.212]  How insane!
[02:35:40.052 --> 02:35:41.793]  My gosh, you can't talk about it.
[02:35:43.133 --> 02:35:43.693]  What a joke.
[02:35:44.113 --> 02:35:45.394]  Can you talk about the fact?
[02:35:45.814 --> 02:35:49.335]  This is my favorite, probably my favorite proof the election was stolen.
[02:35:50.075 --> 02:35:50.815]  In Georgia.
[02:35:51.778 --> 02:35:57.801]  The Georgia, I guess it's Board of Elections, whoever it is that's in charge of mail-in ballots and ballots and county votes.
[02:35:58.561 --> 02:36:09.166]  That Georgia state election agency paid for a million mail-in ballots to be printed a few days before Election Day.
[02:36:09.827 --> 02:36:11.988]  Now, keep in mind what mail-in ballots are for.
[02:36:12.468 --> 02:36:14.149]  You have to mail them to someone!
[02:36:14.798 --> 02:36:19.280]  They only ordered the printing like three or four days before the election.
[02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:22.461]  They didn't get it back till the day before the election.
[02:36:22.861 --> 02:36:24.361]  A million mail-in ballots.
[02:36:24.722 --> 02:36:27.803]  They couldn't have been mailed to anyone that could have voted.
[02:36:27.823 --> 02:36:32.124]  They wasted tens of millions of dollars of taxpayer money.
[02:36:33.885 --> 02:36:34.285]  Or did they?
[02:36:35.066 --> 02:36:40.008]  Because obviously what they did is they ordered them so they could be used after the election.
[02:36:40.428 --> 02:36:49.891]  Once they knew on election night what kind of lead Trump had, they had a million ballots to fill them out quickly and get them in for whatever lead Trump had.
[02:36:49.911 --> 02:36:52.491]  And it was, I believe, 100,000 vote lead in Georgia.
[02:36:52.751 --> 02:36:58.073]  And there's no way they were going to overcome that, except they were ready for a 990,000 vote lead.
[02:36:58.313 --> 02:37:04.495]  They had a million fake ballots that they could fill in and hand in in the days after the election.
[02:37:04.815 --> 02:37:07.997]  Whatever the total was on election night, they always knew they'd beat it.
[02:37:08.457 --> 02:37:09.517]  Same thing in Pennsylvania.
[02:37:09.837 --> 02:37:11.358]  They always knew they'd beat it.
[02:37:11.858 --> 02:37:20.242]  Who orders ballots to be printed, mail-in ballots, only days before the election, knowing you can never mail them out to anyone?
[02:37:21.443 --> 02:37:23.384]  Anyway, we know the election was stolen.
[02:37:25.005 --> 02:37:27.126]  And now you see the results of a stolen election.
[02:37:27.666 --> 02:37:31.828]  Your kids and my kids may wind up in World War III and dying.
[02:37:32.455 --> 02:37:48.306]  Because we elected an old, feeble man, a clueless zombie puppet with dementia, who doesn't know what he's doing, and the real leader of the country is Obama, and the guy who gives Obama his orders is clearly George Soros and the Chinese Communist Party.
[02:37:48.606 --> 02:38:00.875]  China clearly owns this presidency, and George Soros clearly owns this presidency, and their goal is to destroy the United States, and they're doing a damn fine job of it every single day.
[02:38:02.186 --> 02:38:03.406]  But you know what's the real problem?
[02:38:03.426 --> 02:38:05.107]  We have to fight with the Republicans too.
[02:38:05.407 --> 02:38:06.927]  There's George Soros up on the screen.
[02:38:07.327 --> 02:38:11.668]  But it's the Rhino Republicans in the end that really let us down.
[02:38:12.168 --> 02:38:13.748]  Let me give you a couple good examples.
[02:38:13.788 --> 02:38:16.729]  So right now in the news is Lindsey Graham.
[02:38:17.309 --> 02:38:29.891]  Good old Lindsey Graham, Senator of South Carolina, says Biden is as good a man as God ever created and Biden needs to go after anybody and everybody who tries to defend Putin.
[02:38:31.167 --> 02:38:36.070]  Folks, in the history of America, nobody has ever said things like this.
[02:38:36.650 --> 02:38:52.300]  No one has ever said, if you defend Putin, or defend Russia, or you're against us giving money to Ukraine, and you don't want us fighting World War III over Ukraine, and you don't want your American children dying, boys and girls dying in Ukraine like they died in Vietnam.
[02:38:53.177 --> 02:38:54.278]  That you're a bad person.
[02:38:54.298 --> 02:38:57.680]  Do you remember people protesting horribly against the Vietnam War?
[02:38:58.040 --> 02:39:03.844]  They were all a bunch of hippies and liberals and commies and flag burners and losers and pot smokers.
[02:39:04.304 --> 02:39:06.145]  But nobody ever did anything to them!
[02:39:06.506 --> 02:39:08.327]  You're allowed to protest in America!
[02:39:08.962 --> 02:39:15.146]  But all of a sudden, even a rhino Republican like Lindsey Graham says you have no right to protest.
[02:39:15.287 --> 02:39:16.067]  Come on!
[02:39:16.527 --> 02:39:17.968]  How horrible is this?
[02:39:18.389 --> 02:39:24.313]  Doesn't anybody see that we're becoming Russia, Soviet Union slash Nazi Germany?
[02:39:24.653 --> 02:39:25.774]  Can you not see that?
[02:39:27.295 --> 02:39:38.523]  When your own government calls you a domestic terrorist because you say the things that I'm saying on today's show, then we're becoming Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
[02:39:39.620 --> 02:39:40.260]  All over again.
[02:39:40.740 --> 02:39:41.260]  It's horrible.
[02:39:41.501 --> 02:39:42.781]  You're becoming East Germany.
[02:39:43.101 --> 02:39:44.221]  You're becoming Cuba.
[02:39:44.501 --> 02:39:45.942]  We're becoming Venezuela.
[02:39:46.222 --> 02:39:47.642]  You can see it happening in front of you.
[02:39:47.982 --> 02:39:55.864]  The only thing that saved us so far is conservative talk radio and conservative talk TV, like the Alex Jones Show and just a couple of shows out there.
[02:39:56.125 --> 02:39:58.485]  Tucker Carlson, a few others, and Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:39:58.945 --> 02:40:05.187]  And, you know, if not for our voices, you'd have nothing and nobody would be able to ever get the truth.
[02:40:06.867 --> 02:40:07.508]  Got a minute to go?
[02:40:07.828 --> 02:40:08.468]  So we got a minute.
[02:40:08.528 --> 02:40:08.728]  All right.
[02:40:09.344 --> 02:40:13.766]  So I just want to mention quickly, Rhino Republicans, on the topic of rhinos and Lindsey Graham.
[02:40:14.146 --> 02:40:27.153]  In Nevada, we had a Rhino Republican governor named Brian Sandoval, and we won every race you could possibly win, and he won in a landslide, and we controlled the whole state, and we should have kept it forever, and it would be a red state forever, Nevada.
[02:40:27.693 --> 02:40:32.175]  Except, he gave, immediately, the illegal aliens the right to drive.
[02:40:32.776 --> 02:40:39.411]  So every illegal in the state went to DMV, got a driver's license, and while there, they automatically got...
[02:40:40.974 --> 02:40:46.078]  Registered to vote and we've never won another race ever in Nevada.
[02:40:46.418 --> 02:40:54.483]  Not one important race has a Republican ever won again after we had won every race in the state in a landslide ten years ago.
[02:40:54.803 --> 02:40:59.607]  We've had ten years of losing and losing and losing since a rhino Republican ruined everything.
[02:41:00.087 --> 02:41:00.907]  Brian Sandoval.
[02:41:00.927 --> 02:41:01.528]  Thanks, Brian.
[02:41:01.848 --> 02:41:03.589]  With friends like you, nobody needs enemies.
[02:41:04.030 --> 02:41:04.610]  Wayne Alleyroot.
[02:41:05.228 --> 02:41:06.750]  Guest host, Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:06.770 --> 02:41:07.370]  We'll be right back.
[02:41:07.831 --> 02:41:09.152]  All right, welcome back, Wayne Allyn Root.
[02:41:09.192 --> 02:41:11.094]  Last segment, man, does this hour go fast.
[02:41:11.895 --> 02:41:15.999]  I am the guest host on Tuesdays, although I will not be with you next Tuesday.
[02:41:16.039 --> 02:41:17.720]  Look at that, I'm already missing a Tuesday.
[02:41:18.681 --> 02:41:22.104]  I'm the guest host every Tuesday at 12 noon West Coast time.
[02:41:22.885 --> 02:41:26.589]  That would be 3 o'clock East Coast time for the hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:27.409 --> 02:41:37.313]  But next Tuesday, and for the next week in general, I will be in Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump's beautiful home and estate and country club in Palm Beach, Florida, enjoying my honeymoon.
[02:41:37.773 --> 02:41:44.135]  And as a personal invite to go down there, and I'm very proud of it, and I'll spend the week in one of the most beautiful places in the entire world.
[02:41:44.175 --> 02:41:48.257]  It's a fantasy land called Mar-a-Lago, probably worth a quarter of a billion dollars.
[02:41:48.397 --> 02:41:51.898]  One home worth a quarter of a billion dollars, maybe even a half billion now.
[02:41:51.978 --> 02:41:58.422]   For all I know, a half billion now that real estate is flying All over the country, but especially in Florida and especially in Palm Beach.
[02:41:58.722 --> 02:42:00.243]  It's probably worth a half billion dollars.
[02:42:00.703 --> 02:42:02.205]  It's an amazing fantasy land.
[02:42:02.465 --> 02:42:04.146]  And that's what always made me laugh, by the way.
[02:42:04.486 --> 02:42:17.197]  I know I'm kind of jumping off to a new topic, but during the whole four years of Trump as president, and the two years he ran for president, six years, I remember laughing every time liberals said what a failure Donald Trump was.
[02:42:17.217 --> 02:42:18.057]  He's a failure!
[02:42:18.438 --> 02:42:19.298]  He's a loser!
[02:42:19.639 --> 02:42:21.420]  Look at all the firms that have failed!
[02:42:21.740 --> 02:42:23.782]  All the casinos that failed with his name on it!
[02:42:24.488 --> 02:42:44.536]  And I sat there and I just laughed, because I wrote the book, Trump Rules, about his rules that changed my life and made me into a self-made millionaire by the age of 27, and one of the youngest TV anchormen in America, and host of five shows on CNBC, and eventually a national radio host, and a best-selling author, and a producer of reality TV shows, and this is my life!
[02:42:44.956 --> 02:42:46.257]  I have a life very much like Trump.
[02:42:46.357 --> 02:42:56.402]   Oh, and a presidential candidate in 2008, and I won the Libertarian Vice Presidential nomination and served on the presidential ticket for the 2008 You may not have known it, but my name was on your ballot.
[02:42:56.422 --> 02:43:02.487]  I don't know if you voted for me as a libertarian, but my name was on the ballot the year McCain ran against Obama in 2008.
[02:43:03.348 --> 02:43:07.231]  So, I always laughed because I was trained by Trump.
[02:43:09.522 --> 02:43:11.744]  Trump was my mentor and I really followed everything he did.
[02:43:12.285 --> 02:43:18.049]  And Trump's biggest rule or biggest takeaway from Trump's life is failure is part of success.
[02:43:18.650 --> 02:43:27.877]  If you fight hard and you're always in the battle and you never give up and you don't want a safe paycheck working for someone else, you want to work for yourself, you're going to fail sometimes.
[02:43:28.457 --> 02:43:32.260]  And when you fail, you've got to pick yourself back up and get back in the ballgame.
[02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:34.442]  Get back on the horse, get back on the saddle.
[02:43:35.054 --> 02:43:48.136]  And I've done that so many times, I kind of figure in my mind that in my lifetime, I've probably started a hundred businesses, failed at 70, succeeded at 30, and that made me a self-made millionaire at the age of 27, a long time ago.
[02:43:48.696 --> 02:43:51.737]  So life is, you know, you gotta fail to succeed.
[02:43:52.237 --> 02:44:07.238]   So Donald Trump failed with Trump, you know, liquor, I think it was, Trump wine, and then Trump failed with Trump Airlines, and Trump had a couple of casinos that failed, and I listed in my book, Trump Rules, some of the failures of Donald Trump.
[02:44:07.238 --> 02:44:10.099]  And guess what?
[02:44:10.099 --> 02:44:13.279]  Trump failed something like 38 times in his career.
[02:44:13.279 --> 02:44:18.518]   He had 38 businesses that flopped, but he also had like 50 that succeeded
[02:44:18.518 --> 02:44:22.217]  that made him worth somewhere around $6 to $8 billion.
[02:44:23.207 --> 02:44:24.328]  You call that a failure?
[02:44:24.888 --> 02:44:31.874]  And it's the classic joke that I use to open up all of my, or used to use, to open up all of my success seminars pre-COVID.
[02:44:32.174 --> 02:44:35.957]  I used to fly all over the world to give Tony Robbins-like success seminars.
[02:44:36.637 --> 02:44:43.743]  And I used to open every seminar by saying, what do you call a guy who owns 10 restaurants and nine of them fail and go out of business?
[02:44:44.944 --> 02:44:45.364]  Millionaire.
[02:44:45.624 --> 02:44:46.265]  You only need one.
[02:44:46.937 --> 02:44:49.740]  And the crowd would laugh and they got it right away.
[02:44:49.780 --> 02:44:50.441]  They loved it.
[02:44:50.861 --> 02:44:52.423]  You only need one to succeed.
[02:44:52.603 --> 02:44:53.484]  One great restaurant.
[02:44:53.524 --> 02:44:56.067]  You're a millionaire in the great United States of America.
[02:44:56.087 --> 02:44:56.968]  That's what makes it great.
[02:44:57.248 --> 02:45:00.892]  It's what makes American exceptionalism and the American dream and capitalism.
[02:45:00.912 --> 02:45:02.414]  You don't have to succeed with everything you do.
[02:45:03.471 --> 02:45:12.233]  But the end result is Trump is a winner and he's got a house worth 250 to 500 million dollars and he's got, you know, a net worth of billions and billions of dollars.
[02:45:12.613 --> 02:45:14.614]  I don't think the failures matter anymore now, do you?
[02:45:15.094 --> 02:45:16.074]  I sure don't think so.
[02:45:16.354 --> 02:45:17.694]  And look what he did for our country!
[02:45:17.714 --> 02:45:27.977]  I hope you were here for the opening segment where I read you my column coming out this weekend in newspapers around the country about what America was like under Trump versus what America is like now.
[02:45:28.077 --> 02:45:29.717]  God, don't you want Donald Trump back?
[02:45:30.257 --> 02:45:33.641]  All right, my book is called The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.
[02:45:33.661 --> 02:45:35.163]  I hope you'll buy a copy.
[02:45:35.223 --> 02:46:08.554]   You can go to my website rootforamerica.com and check out more about the book, but you can get it at Amazon and BarnesandNoble.com and in it you'll find all the top companies and CEOs and their phone numbers and their emails and their websites and their social media sites and And how you contact them in a multitude of ways to let them know these are the bad guys that fund Democrat candidates and who treat Republicans like garbage even though we buy most of their products, the Great Patriot protest and boycott book, and it teaches you how to use civil disobedience and strikes and boycotts to fight back.
[02:46:08.914 --> 02:46:09.214]  All right.
[02:46:09.715 --> 02:46:22.525]  So today, just as I was saying in my commentary to start the show, inflation rises to 10% in the producer index, the highest ever on record in the history of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
[02:46:23.166 --> 02:46:25.027]  So that's 10% inflation.
[02:46:25.588 --> 02:46:31.393]  But the problem with inflation is they leave out of the inflation index all the things that people really need.
[02:46:32.133 --> 02:46:39.828]   Cars, homes, groceries, gas, and I believe all forms of energy like home heating oil.
[02:46:40.328 --> 02:46:48.794]  When you add in the things that people need that they leave out, if you counted it the same way you did in 1980, inflation would be somewhere between 16% and 20% today.
[02:46:49.254 --> 02:46:51.856]  It would not be 7%, 8%, 9%, or 10%.
[02:46:52.677 --> 02:46:55.639]  So we have a disaster brewing in this country.
[02:46:56.299 --> 02:47:00.202]  I also mentioned how bad the border was in my new column.
[02:47:01.002 --> 02:47:01.883]  And here's the story.
[02:47:02.023 --> 02:47:07.448]  Migrant encounters at southern border in February surged 63% over last year.
[02:47:07.468 --> 02:47:08.488]  164,973 encounters in February.
[02:47:08.508 --> 02:47:10.630]  So let's round it out to 165,000 up 63% from last year.
[02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:13.473]  Now, folks, I want to point out something about last year.
[02:47:13.352 --> 02:47:20.712]   encounters in February. So let's round it out to 165,000 up 63% from last year.
[02:47:20.712 --> 02:47:25.672]  Now, folks, I want to point out something about last year.
[02:47:25.672 --> 02:47:30.952]  Last year was February of 2021. So Biden was president.
[02:47:31.088 --> 02:47:33.449]  It's like it's up 63% under Trump.
[02:47:33.989 --> 02:47:36.830]  It's up 63% over last year under Biden.
[02:47:37.350 --> 02:47:44.471]  And Biden was already at that point, letting in more people than we'd ever seen since the Obama days.
[02:47:44.871 --> 02:47:50.373]  And maybe the most people ever coming across the border in history, because it's now official that we let everybody in.
[02:47:50.713 --> 02:47:52.013]  And Biden announced it to the world.
[02:47:53.226 --> 02:48:02.968]  So, it's a full-fledged disaster at the border, up 63% over last year, and last year was already very, very, very bad.
[02:48:03.649 --> 02:48:06.449]  So, now I've backed up two of the things I said in my column.
[02:48:06.849 --> 02:48:10.690]  Inflation is raging, and open borders are raging.
[02:48:11.570 --> 02:48:13.851]  Let me mention another thing from my column.
[02:48:14.734 --> 02:48:23.762]  The DHS, the Department of Homeland Security, is scanning employees' social media for conspiracy theories and extremism.
[02:48:24.583 --> 02:48:41.737]  Again, speaking of Nazi Germany, speaking of the Soviets, examples of extremism cited by the DHS are a belief that fraud occurred in the 2020 election and objections to current coronavirus policies.
[02:48:42.808 --> 02:48:43.528]  Oh my god!
[02:48:43.548 --> 02:48:45.029]  You gotta be kidding me!
[02:48:45.329 --> 02:48:46.290]  That's extremism!
[02:48:46.450 --> 02:48:46.910]  I told you!
[02:48:47.350 --> 02:48:48.131]  It's Nazi Germany.
[02:48:48.571 --> 02:48:49.331]  It's Soviet Union.
[02:48:49.651 --> 02:48:50.432]  It's East Germany.
[02:48:50.912 --> 02:48:52.673]  And by the way, aren't these facts?
[02:48:53.233 --> 02:48:55.594]  Okay, you can argue about the stolen election.
[02:48:55.614 --> 02:48:58.435]  I just told you why it's very clear to me the election was stolen.
[02:48:58.755 --> 02:49:04.898]  And I just told you minutes ago that if you won't let us talk about a stolen election, then we know the election was stolen!
[02:49:05.138 --> 02:49:06.019]  We double know!
[02:49:07.399 --> 02:49:10.821]  But separate from all that, the coronavirus policies?
[02:49:11.616 --> 02:49:13.217]  I'm against the coronavirus policies.
[02:49:13.598 --> 02:49:14.978]  Haven't they been proven failures?
[02:49:15.299 --> 02:49:17.320]  The vaccines didn't stop anyone from getting COVID.
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:18.401]  Who's got it now?
[02:49:18.561 --> 02:49:19.021]  Obama.
[02:49:19.542 --> 02:49:20.522]  Obama has COVID.
[02:49:22.104 --> 02:49:25.486]  Sorry for laughing about that, but you know, Obama has COVID.
[02:49:26.261 --> 02:49:27.282]  They've all got COVID.
[02:49:27.642 --> 02:49:29.223]  Everybody who got vaccinated has COVID.
[02:49:29.684 --> 02:49:36.569]  Israel has the most vaccines in the world, they have the most COVID in the world, the most hospitalizations for COVID in the world, the most deaths from COVID in the world.
[02:49:36.889 --> 02:49:43.914]  And I imagine if they ever allowed you to know about it, Israel must have the most heart attacks and strokes after getting vaccinated.
[02:49:44.235 --> 02:49:51.760]  So people aren't dying of COVID, they're dying in record numbers of heart attacks and strokes, and blood clots, but they're not saying it's COVID related.
[02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:53.722]  I guarantee you they've got the highest number of that as well.
[02:49:54.562 --> 02:49:55.282]  Masks don't work.
[02:49:55.342 --> 02:49:56.383]  New study out this morning.
[02:49:56.643 --> 02:50:03.924]  Not one mask mandated city, county, or state in America stopped COVID with their mask mandates.
[02:50:04.304 --> 02:50:09.426]  Meanwhile, Florida never made you wear a mask, never made you get vaccinated, and everything's great in Florida.
[02:50:09.446 --> 02:50:10.406]  I'm heading there tomorrow.
[02:50:10.726 --> 02:50:12.927]  Life is good in Florida, so stop lying.
[02:50:13.287 --> 02:50:14.907]  Couple of polls out I want you to know about.
[02:50:15.407 --> 02:50:17.968]  Only 37% approve of Joe Biden.
[02:50:18.828 --> 02:50:19.988]  Let's see who this poll is.
[02:50:20.648 --> 02:50:22.789]  This is a civics poll.
[02:50:24.311 --> 02:50:28.073]  37% of voters approved of Biden.
[02:50:28.093 --> 02:50:29.234]  54% disapproved.
[02:50:29.694 --> 02:50:31.035]  Joe Biden in major trouble.
[02:50:31.455 --> 02:50:35.378]  We're headed for a huge Republican landslide this November.
[02:50:35.838 --> 02:50:38.880]  Assuming that A, elections aren't rigged.
[02:50:39.360 --> 02:50:41.121]  B, social media isn't rigged.
[02:50:41.682 --> 02:50:46.665]  And that's B. And C, Democrats aren't going to get us a World War III and postpone the election.
[02:50:47.285 --> 02:50:56.794]  And four, that we've made some changes between now and then in battleground states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada.
[02:50:57.095 --> 02:51:02.860]  Some changes that tighten up the rules and impose voter ID and get rid of ballot harvesting.
[02:51:03.160 --> 02:51:05.322]  If we make a few changes, we win big in November.
[02:51:05.723 --> 02:51:09.967]  The biggest ever, I would guess, maybe even like 80 seats, maybe more than 80 seats.
[02:51:10.874 --> 02:51:13.815]  But we've got to make those changes, and we've got to have an election.
[02:51:14.215 --> 02:51:19.657]  I'll bet Democrats will try to figure out a way to start World War III so we never have an election day.
[02:51:20.257 --> 02:51:20.897]  Wait on Root!
[02:51:21.377 --> 02:51:22.637]  Guest host for Alex Jones today.
[02:51:22.657 --> 02:51:23.578]  It was an honor to be with you.
[02:51:23.918 --> 02:51:29.259]  My website, rootforamerica.com, and you can always reach me, wainrootatgmail.com.
[02:51:29.319 --> 02:51:30.220]  I love to hear from you.
[02:51:30.580 --> 02:51:31.400]  Love to hear what you think.
[02:51:31.760 --> 02:51:32.500]  I get inspired.
[02:51:32.580 --> 02:51:36.181]  I get my best ideas and my best solutions from all of you.
[02:51:36.541 --> 02:51:38.582]  wainrootatgmail.com.
[02:51:39.008 --> 02:51:51.439]  And I'm glad, Alex, that we've been able to keep Survival Shield in stock, because I know we've had problems even accessing these deep-earth minerals at times, because it's such a rare and unique formula that we have at InfoWars store.
[02:51:52.480 --> 02:51:53.481]  Well, let's be clear, Owen.
[02:51:53.541 --> 02:51:55.863]  I'm not in super good shape like you are.
[02:51:55.883 --> 02:51:57.284]  I've kind of let myself go over the years.
[02:51:57.905 --> 02:52:06.472]   But if I wasn't taking deep-earth crystal iodine or true atomic iodine, I mean, it's completely pure.
[02:52:07.073 --> 02:52:10.034]  I would not have the energy and the stamina and the focus that I've got now.
[02:52:10.054 --> 02:52:19.157]  And the reason I wanted to pop on with you here live is just to let the listeners know you've kept us on air during all the battles and the fights over the last 20 plus years.
[02:52:19.737 --> 02:52:29.861]  But now with the deep state and the Democrat operations and all their lawsuits and all their trials coming up and all their hit pieces, now more than ever, InfoWars needs the funds.
[02:52:30.341 --> 02:52:35.541]   So all the investment listeners have made with their word of mouth and their time and their energy over the years
[02:52:35.541 --> 02:52:39.780]   It's like a baby that's eight and a half months pregnant the last few weeks the pregnancy of
[02:52:39.780 --> 02:52:43.980]   Infowars work Exposing the globalists long before they launched their
[02:52:43.980 --> 02:52:48.720]   great reset is now building towards a crescendo and every day. We stay on air is
[02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:53.435]   More important last few months. We were on the air The quickening is here.
[02:52:53.635 --> 02:52:55.916]  And this is my own personal bottle of X3.
[02:52:55.936 --> 02:52:57.317]  That's why part of it's gone.
[02:52:57.857 --> 02:53:00.618]  This is triiodine, the deep-earth crystal atomic iodine.
[02:53:00.958 --> 02:53:05.920]  And then two other naturally occurring types that help absorb it into the body.
[02:53:05.940 --> 02:53:10.922]  Because a small percentage of people cannot absorb just the pure crystal iodine, even though it's the very best out there.
[02:53:10.942 --> 02:53:15.384]  But with the other two types, the scientists that developed this tell us it's even more powerful.
[02:53:15.644 --> 02:53:16.444]  That's why we have X2 and X3.
[02:53:16.464 --> 02:53:24.810]   But X3 is selling out right now and it's 50% off because I want people to get it.
[02:53:25.190 --> 02:53:27.031]  It's gonna be sold out for months and months and months.
[02:53:27.132 --> 02:53:28.332]  It'll be at least 10 weeks.
[02:53:28.713 --> 02:53:32.476]  We'll reorder it till more comes in because of supply chain breakdowns.
[02:53:32.936 --> 02:53:44.404]  But despite that, I'm still gonna go ahead and sell it out in the next few weeks at current sales because I want everybody to have it for your immune systems and for some of the other big events that are taking place and unfolding right now.
[02:53:44.484 --> 02:53:51.726]   So I really cannot describe to viewers and listeners out there how important it is to have a true natural source of iodine.
[02:53:51.726 --> 02:53:56.726]   And many people cannot absorb one type of iodine, and they can absorb another type.
[02:53:56.726 --> 02:53:59.726]   Well, that's why we've got all three of the healthy types in here.
[02:53:59.726 --> 02:54:03.726]   There are hundreds of other types of iodine when they're bound to things,
[02:54:03.726 --> 02:54:08.726]   and they're basically not really iodine, so your body can't get them.
[02:54:08.726 --> 02:54:11.726]   Then you've got all the bad halogens that are the opposite of iodine,
[02:54:11.726 --> 02:54:17.886]   the bromide, the bromine, the fluoride, the chlorine, that they actually put in the food and in the water that
[02:54:17.886 --> 02:54:20.726]   actually lowers your IQ and dumbs you down and makes you unhealthy.
[02:54:20.726 --> 02:54:23.726]   This is the good halogen, and when you have this in your thyroid--
[02:54:24.221 --> 02:54:30.384]  Then it's very, very hard for the bad ones to get into your thyroid that regulates all the major hormones in your body.
[02:54:30.724 --> 02:54:32.645]  So when I forget to take it, I certainly feel it.
[02:54:32.906 --> 02:54:34.927]  It's a game changer and it funds the InfoWar.
[02:54:35.227 --> 02:54:39.789]  So ladies and gentlemen, get X3 exclusively at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:54:40.149 --> 02:54:42.931]  Take it under the tongue for maximum effect right in the bloodstream.
[02:54:43.011 --> 02:54:48.114]  And I guarantee if you just try this product, you will continue to reorder it because it really does work.

[02:54:52.593 --> 02:55:12.593]  [Music]
[02:55:12.768 --> 02:55:13.388]  How did you get here?
[02:55:14.749 --> 02:55:16.849]  I just caught you, American!
[02:55:17.149 --> 02:55:19.230]  You visited Bandar Video!
[02:55:20.150 --> 02:55:23.370]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you!
[02:55:23.950 --> 02:55:29.472]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video, or I have to hurt you!
[02:55:32.572 --> 02:55:34.312]  Conflict.
[02:55:34.492 --> 02:55:36.913]  It comes from China.
