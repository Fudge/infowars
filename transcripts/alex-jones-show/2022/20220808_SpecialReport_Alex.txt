[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.820]  [Outro]
[00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:14.392]  There is an ongoing deep state coup against our nation.
[00:00:15.012 --> 00:00:17.313]  It is Monday, the 8th of August, 2022.
[00:00:18.153 --> 00:00:29.775]  We're 91 days out from the midterms, where every poll shows a total political realignment and the destruction of the criminal Democratic Party that's carrying out the great reset against America.
[00:00:30.275 --> 00:00:38.173]   Now, there was a SWAT team raid hours ago against the real presidents A president can't take classified information.
[00:00:38.193 --> 00:00:39.494]  That's part of the National Archives.
[00:00:39.514 --> 00:00:40.694]  That's part of what a president can do.
[00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:41.454]  So this is a very dangerous moment.
[00:00:41.653 --> 00:00:48.693]   He's running again for the 2024 election, only 91 days out from the midterms.
[00:00:48.693 --> 00:00:52.453]   They have SWAT teamed him, claiming he took classified information.
[00:00:52.453 --> 00:00:55.012]  A president can't take classified information.
[00:00:55.012 --> 00:00:56.373]  That's part of the National Archives.
[00:00:56.373 --> 00:00:58.172]  That's part of what a president can do.
[00:00:58.172 --> 00:01:01.352]  So this is a very dangerous moment.
[00:01:01.352 --> 00:01:03.793]  Everyone is turning against the deep state.
[00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:05.813]  Everyone is waking up at record levels.
[00:01:05.813 --> 00:01:08.054]  And we've known this was coming.
[00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:13.905]  I said today on the radio, what are they going to do when they're losing all political power and the world's waking up to them?
[00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:19.688]  And the answer is they're going to try to arrest President Trump, the real president of the United States.
[00:01:19.748 --> 00:01:20.828]  Say what you want about Trump.
[00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:22.089]  He loves America.
[00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.910]  He cares about our sovereignty.
[00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.232]  And the globalists hate his guts because he actually tried to be the president.
[00:01:28.272 --> 00:01:37.436]   But more than ever now, because he's under attack, I am backing President Trump because this is not a sunshine patriot time.
[00:01:37.917 --> 00:01:40.338]  This is a time for winter soldiers.
[00:01:40.438 --> 00:01:43.120]  So, unprecedented emergency news alert.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.502]  We are putting this up on InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:01:46.922 --> 00:01:48.983]  This is just absolutely insane.
[00:01:49.043 --> 00:01:56.147]  And to get even crazier, ABC News, the Daily Mail and others are reporting Trump was raided because of my phone.
[00:01:57.028 --> 00:01:59.971]  That was supposedly leaked to lawyers in the Sandy Hook show trial.
[00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:01.593]  They didn't get my phone.
[00:02:02.053 --> 00:02:02.774]  It's not true.
[00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:05.897]  It's some text messages from 2019, early 2000.
[00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:08.179]  Totally made up.
[00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.224]  So, this is their pretext after the Russia hoax, after the Ukraine hoax.
[00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:17.949]  After claiming Trump stole the election five years ago, they're doing it again.
[00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:26.378]  This is a coup by the deep state, by the bureaucracy, that knows the American people are peacefully taking our nation back.
[00:02:26.418 --> 00:02:27.259]  But you better know.
[00:02:28.427 --> 00:02:31.268]  To raid a former president has never been done before.
[00:02:31.628 --> 00:02:33.308]  He's really the acting president.
[00:02:33.988 --> 00:02:36.308]  This is so incredibly dangerous.
[00:02:36.348 --> 00:02:48.051]  Roger Stone was at a gala with another great patriot, General Flynn, and he stepped out to his car to give us his breaking news as a former political president himself and what he believes this means.
[00:02:48.331 --> 00:02:51.091]  Roger Stone, thanks for joining us on this emergency broadcast.
[00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:55.412]  Alex, it's a very, very sad day for America.
[00:02:56.147 --> 00:03:05.969]  This is the kind of thing you expect to see in Soviet Russia, Nazi Germany, Communist Cuba, but not what you expect to see in the United States.
[00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.870]  It's unprecedented.
[00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:17.152]  People need to understand that at this time of year, President Trump has decamped to his place in Bedminster, New Jersey.
[00:03:17.612 --> 00:03:19.453]  He's not in Mar-a-Lago.
[00:03:19.993 --> 00:03:32.364]   It's inconceivable what evidence the government might think Would be in Mar-a-Lago, but this is a continuation of what we've seen over the last couple weeks.
[00:03:33.085 --> 00:03:53.137]   The total weaponization of our justice system, the entire weaponization of the Justice Department, the FBI, and it's abundantly clear to me that they realize that they cannot defeat Donald Trump in a fair, Honest, transparent election.
[00:03:53.658 --> 00:03:57.380]  They know that they're heading for ignominious defeat in the midterms.
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.862]  So this is the stunt we have been waiting for.
[00:04:01.882 --> 00:04:05.164]  This is a stunt that both of us have pretty much predicted.
[00:04:05.584 --> 00:04:10.727]  It is an outrage that they would treat a former President of the United States this way.
[00:04:11.507 --> 00:04:17.352]   What they don't understand is, if this is ...meant to dissuade Donald Trump from running.
[00:04:17.972 --> 00:04:20.814]  All they have done is just guarantee that he will run.
[00:04:22.656 --> 00:04:28.601]  Roger, you talk about third world countries, Venezuela, Cuba.
[00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:30.883]  I mean, for those that don't know U.S.
[00:04:30.923 --> 00:04:33.225]  history, you've been involved in six presidential campaigns.
[00:04:34.426 --> 00:04:35.927]  No one ever in U.S.
[00:04:35.967 --> 00:04:37.789]  politics goes after a former president.
[00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:41.592]  This is a true Rubicon that has been passed.
[00:04:43.942 --> 00:04:45.942]  It is entirely unprecedented.
[00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:53.944]  It is conceivable that if former President Richard Nixon had not been pardoned, that they may have sought to prosecute him.
[00:04:54.504 --> 00:05:02.586]  Very much like that time, they had used their control of the media to whip up a hysteria in the country.
[00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:06.787]  But that was before the advent of the internet.
[00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:15.091]   In this particular case, between the president's top aides being Subpoenaed to a grand jury.
[00:05:16.152 --> 00:05:35.369]  And the raid today at Mar-a-Lago, I think it is abundantly clear that their fear is palpable and that they intend to trump up, pardon the expression, some kind of charge against Trump that is designed to disqualify him from running for president again.
[00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:39.453]  I think they know that if he runs again, that he'll win again.
[00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:58.480]  Given the gas prices, given the food shortages, given the epic inflation, given the fact that we are shipping billions of dollars abroad, but we can't seem to spend the money to seal our own border and end the drug crisis and crime crisis that that is causing.
[00:05:59.201 --> 00:06:00.802]  They are in full panic mode.
[00:06:01.342 --> 00:06:04.564]  And their answer is to victimize President Donald Trump.
[00:06:06.408 --> 00:06:09.951]  I have to tell you, I've been on there 28 years, you've been involved in politics 50.
[00:06:10.912 --> 00:06:14.134]  I have never even imagined something like this.
[00:06:14.715 --> 00:06:19.739]  They're claiming, oh, he might have taken some National Archives stuff, which was his own presidential records.
[00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:24.002]  Anybody that knows about the law, presidents control their records.
[00:06:24.403 --> 00:06:26.585]  They set up libraries to hold them.
[00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:33.667]  So their evidence is he may have taken some of his own documents with him, so he violated national security.
[00:06:33.707 --> 00:06:44.370]  The law states the president owns and controls, as a former executive branch chief of staff or former executive branch commander-in-chief, those records.
[00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:54.352]  So a SWAT team raid on his apartment in Mar-a-Lago is just unbelievably flimsy and shows the deep state's desperation.
[00:06:54.753 --> 00:06:56.233]  What do you see coming out of this?
[00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.955]  I think it is abundantly clear that within the context of the D.C.
[00:07:02.995 --> 00:07:21.254]  judicial system, which they have total control, I still believe it is their intention to charge the president based on some fabricated charge in connection with the result of the 2020 election because they need to legally disqualify him from being a candidate.
[00:07:21.872 --> 00:07:44.559]   As someone who has had their home raided at 6 o'clock in the morning, who's had 29 heavily armed FBI agents surround and storm my home, I understand the The feeling of persecution, the feeling of the invasion of privacy, it is something you'd expect to see in a banana republic.
[00:07:45.259 --> 00:07:52.547]  If the Justice Department wanted the President to produce some document, then the proper forum would have been in the courts.
[00:07:53.468 --> 00:07:59.420]  There was a lot of case law around Nixon's control of his documents post-Watergate.
[00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:01.284]  There's a lot of precedent here.
[00:08:01.304 --> 00:08:03.990]  I think that this is designed for the shock value.
[00:08:04.565 --> 00:08:08.808]  It's designed for the same reason that the raid in my home was designed.
[00:08:09.228 --> 00:08:21.897]  They could have contacted my lawyers and told me to turn myself in to face the fabricated charges against me, but they staged the raids for the drama of it, for the optics of it.
[00:08:22.317 --> 00:08:23.618]  I think that's what's happened here.
[00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:28.722]  It's to further demonize Donald Trump as some kind of criminal.
[00:08:29.218 --> 00:08:31.260]  Roger, we talked on the phone two weeks ago.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:35.643]  You may have forgotten, but you said, no, I think they're going to try to indict Trump.
[00:08:36.424 --> 00:08:38.626]  Clearly, this is a prelude to that.
[00:08:38.686 --> 00:08:39.887]  What do you expect to come next?
[00:08:41.808 --> 00:08:43.249]  It's very hard to say.
[00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:45.971]  The grand jury, as you know, operates in secret.
[00:08:46.952 --> 00:08:52.937]  But I think it is now increasingly obvious that they intend to charge the president.
[00:08:54.158 --> 00:09:01.510]   And of course, the more The stronger he looks, the more panicky they get.
[00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:42.640]   So the fact that he won with 69% of the vote, the straw poll at CPAC this weekend, the positive vibes coming out of the former president regarding his candidacy, every poll across the country showing that he is the odds-on favorite, not only to be nominated, but also to win a rematch with Joe Biden or whoever the Democrats nominate, that has forced them to It is abundantly clear to me that, sadly, the Attorney General appears to have given in to the pressure from the extreme progressive left wing of his party, and they intend to charge the President.
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.984]  The President's statement tonight, I thought, was very, very strong.
[00:09:47.525 --> 00:09:50.147]  Donald Trump cannot be intimidated.
[00:09:50.687 --> 00:09:53.950]  If you think you can intimidate him, you don't understand Donald Trump.
[00:09:55.734 --> 00:09:59.637]  Roger Stone, what do you think President Trump should do?
[00:09:59.677 --> 00:10:20.714]  What do you think we should do in response to this clear initiation of a deep state coup against a popular president who had an election stolen from him and an unpopular puppet president gutting the border, gutting the dollar, gutting the military, starting wars, shutting off the power supply of the country.
[00:10:21.474 --> 00:10:22.415]  What does Trump do?
[00:10:22.515 --> 00:10:23.196]  What do we do?
[00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:27.140]  A couple things, Alex.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:28.280]  First of all, we need to pray.
[00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:30.241]  We need to pray for our country.
[00:10:30.261 --> 00:10:32.141]  We need to pray for our president.
[00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:34.282]  We need to pray for our own liberty.
[00:10:34.962 --> 00:10:38.143]  Secondarily, the president needs to get himself a good lawyer.
[00:10:38.743 --> 00:10:40.224]  A lawyer who is a fighter.
[00:10:40.865 --> 00:10:43.186]  A lawyer who does not fear the deep state.
[00:10:43.947 --> 00:10:52.912]  A lawyer who will use all of the necessary legal devices available to defend the president in the face of this.
[00:10:53.672 --> 00:10:55.914]  I think those are the absolute keys right now.
[00:10:56.954 --> 00:10:59.056]  I myself will be praying for the president tonight.
[00:10:59.496 --> 00:11:03.538]  I urge everybody listening to this emergency broadcast to join me in prayer.
[00:11:03.598 --> 00:11:05.259]  It's not just for Trump, the man.
[00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:06.820]  It's for our country.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.122]  This is a terrible precedent for our country.
[00:11:10.686 --> 00:11:17.828]  Well, Roger, I will tell you that Trump's not perfect, neither are you or I. And he's made mistakes, but he's always meant well and has a good spirit.
[00:11:18.308 --> 00:11:22.069]  And now I'm going to back him stronger than ever.
[00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:30.992]  And I expect Governor DeSantis and everybody else to come out behind our president because, I mean, this is the stuff that third world countries, as you said, are made of.
[00:11:31.712 --> 00:11:40.195]  This is so obviously an attempted coup in live time and shows how desperate the enemies of this republic are.
[00:11:42.017 --> 00:11:44.338]  Well, and also the fake news narrative.
[00:11:44.378 --> 00:12:01.704]  I mean, again, the claim that text messages between you and I that were inadvertently sent to the Plaintiff's Council in the Austin defamation trial show nothing whatsoever regarding January 6th or any other illegal or untoward act.
[00:12:02.564 --> 00:12:05.905]  And they're intimate only in the sense that you said to me, God bless you.
[00:12:06.585 --> 00:12:08.826]  So this is yet another fraud.
[00:12:08.846 --> 00:12:09.846]  It has nothing to do.
[00:12:10.127 --> 00:12:17.366]   And since you mentioned that, Literally hundreds of publications are now reporting that the raid is because of my phone.
[00:12:17.926 --> 00:12:31.451]  I sent you the text that we're part of Discovery, that our 2019 and early 2020, nothing embarrassing, actually empowering us, you know, talking and being friends and worried about your wife.
[00:12:32.311 --> 00:12:38.113]  And health issues and talking about God and how we stand with you, Roger, when you were being persecuted at the time.
[00:12:38.753 --> 00:12:44.975]  How do they take that and claim we have the total evidence of January 6th, Alex Jones' phone?
[00:12:45.415 --> 00:12:48.616]  It's just bizarre to be injected into the middle of this.
[00:12:50.357 --> 00:12:51.238]  It's an absurdity.
[00:12:51.398 --> 00:12:54.980]  There's nothing there that's relevant or interesting or illegal.
[00:12:56.101 --> 00:12:58.362]  But it's part of what they do.
[00:12:58.402 --> 00:13:02.064]  Again, they recycle the same false narrative.
[00:13:02.525 --> 00:13:04.746]  Right now, my thoughts and prayers are with the President.
[00:13:05.486 --> 00:13:08.628]  He needs a good, tough, fighting lawyer.
[00:13:09.088 --> 00:13:11.630]  He needs a cohesive team around him.
[00:13:12.951 --> 00:13:16.173]  If you know him, you know this will not dampen his spirits.
[00:13:16.753 --> 00:13:20.574]  That this will not change his determination to save America.
[00:13:20.654 --> 00:13:27.376]  If he was on the edge about whether to run again, if there was any doubt in his mind, I think they have forced his hand.
[00:13:27.896 --> 00:13:32.638]  He will be a candidate, and I predict he will be the next President of the United States.
[00:13:32.858 --> 00:13:35.299]  In closing, you gotta get back to that meeting with General Flynn.
[00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:38.940]  Why would they jump the shark like this?
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.581]  Why would they do something so authoritarian, so ridiculous?
[00:13:44.597 --> 00:13:46.439]  Because this election is hard upon them.
[00:13:46.799 --> 00:13:48.080]  It is fast upon them.
[00:13:48.801 --> 00:14:04.874]  And they know that the combustible combination of gas prices, inflation, food shortages, and the shipping of billions abroad when we have 370,000 homeless veterans in this country is not sitting well with the American people.
[00:14:05.515 --> 00:14:06.736]  They can read the polls.
[00:14:07.376 --> 00:14:09.538]  They desperately need to change the question.
[00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:15.604]   If they can make this election about Donald Trump, Perhaps they believe they can still pull out a victory.
[00:14:16.364 --> 00:14:23.171]  Or they're looking for some excuse not to have a full, fair, transparent election.
[00:14:23.892 --> 00:14:32.740]  But for weeks, you and I have both predicted that there would be some kind of action by the government to affect the upcoming election.
[00:14:33.201 --> 00:14:34.322]  I think this is part of that.
[00:14:35.094 --> 00:14:35.555]  Well, that's right.
[00:14:35.575 --> 00:14:38.119]  You were on just last week and we said it was imminent.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.784]  Roger Stone, please join me tomorrow at 11 a.m.
[00:14:40.864 --> 00:14:43.548]  Central, right when the show kicks off, if you can.
[00:14:43.568 --> 00:14:45.291]  And God bless you.
[00:14:45.592 --> 00:14:48.958]  Where do people find your independent media information?
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.201]  You can watch me every day on the Stone Zone at FrankSpeech.com.

[00:15:08.224 --> 00:15:09.104]  God bless you, Alex.
[00:15:09.224 --> 00:15:09.924]  All right, Roger.
[00:15:09.944 --> 00:15:10.644]  Thank you so much.
[00:15:10.684 --> 00:15:11.864]  Let's all pray for President Trump.
[00:15:11.884 --> 00:15:12.244]  Thank you.
[00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:22.809]   I'm not going to say much more here on this Emergency Monday transmission, but ladies and gentlemen, President Trump shut off the lobbyists.
[00:15:23.049 --> 00:15:24.690]  President Trump controlled the border.
[00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.231]  He stood up to Communist China.
[00:15:26.271 --> 00:15:27.212]  He brought jobs back.
[00:15:27.732 --> 00:15:28.792]  He did so many good things.
[00:15:28.832 --> 00:15:29.913]  He pushed the poison shot.
[00:15:30.293 --> 00:15:46.781]  I'm really mad at him about that, but the establishment absolutely hates him, and to have them raid him, and to have them claim it has something to do with my phone, when my phone was not turned over to lawyers, and there's nothing on my phone, is so incredibly dangerous.
[00:15:47.342 --> 00:15:51.126]   This is A deep state coup against America.
[00:15:51.986 --> 00:16:06.018]  It is a deep state coup against the voting rights of Americans because the criminal chai comms and globalist centrists that control the Democratic Party know that the world is turning against them.
[00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:15.406]  They know that there is a major political realignment against everything they are doing.
[00:16:16.841 --> 00:16:23.163]  They know record numbers of blacks, Hispanics, Asians, women, you name it, are voting for Republicans.
[00:16:23.203 --> 00:16:29.286]  Not because they're perfect, but because people recognize the Democratic Party is absolute pure evil.
[00:16:30.766 --> 00:16:34.708]  And so it's unprecedented to have a raid on a former president.
[00:16:35.529 --> 00:16:41.810]  It's unprecedented to do it claiming that it's over documents when presidents control their documents from their administration.
[00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:42.510]  Look at Obama.
[00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:43.930]  Look at JFK.
[00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:44.871]  Look at Reagan.
[00:16:44.891 --> 00:16:45.691]  Look at all of them.
[00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:46.891]  They control their documents.
[00:16:47.591 --> 00:16:52.492]  So the idea that presidents can't have their own documents is unbelievable.
[00:16:53.252 --> 00:17:03.494]  And it shows how thin their previous claims of Russian collusion and Ukrainian corruption and all of it are.
[00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:10.742]  And it shows how scared they are of President Trump, just like they're scared of Infowars.com.
[00:17:11.102 --> 00:17:16.745]  They're planning some type of coup or power outage or war in the next 91 days before the midterms.
[00:17:17.045 --> 00:17:18.406]  They're politically over.
[00:17:19.346 --> 00:17:20.707]  The world has turned against them.
[00:17:21.648 --> 00:17:26.010]  And we can decide to cower in our holes and hide under our beds and hope it all goes away.
[00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:28.071]  But I'm driving here tonight.
[00:17:28.331 --> 00:17:30.292]  I was home having dinner with my wife and youngest daughter.
[00:17:32.588 --> 00:17:35.371]  I've been really upset with Trump for a lot of reasons, but I know he means well.
[00:17:35.411 --> 00:17:36.151]  He's not a bad man.
[00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:40.215]  I made the decision driving up here this evening to get behind President Trump.
[00:17:40.836 --> 00:17:54.809]  Because he was elected once, he was elected twice, he had the election stolen from him, and that Crypt Keeper puppet that doesn't even know who he is, they claim he's our president, while they sign this legislation for 87,000 new IRS agents to target poor people and working folks.
[00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:04.356]  And while they bring in all these new green taxes to shut down our economy and they shut off our power lines, it is unbelievably dangerous.
[00:18:04.396 --> 00:18:13.163]  And if America falls, like Venezuela and other countries did, the world is going to be in massive trouble because of it.
[00:18:13.203 --> 00:18:31.722]   We have internal groups that want power and control, that have gotten control of the Justice Department, and just like Rome fell because its own Praetorian Guard ended up becoming the leadership of Rome, And because the military became dictators, we are following that exact path right now.
[00:18:32.162 --> 00:18:38.788]  And then it's even more surreal to have all these publications saying it's Alex Jones' phone.
[00:18:40.769 --> 00:18:42.011]  Unbelievable.
[00:18:42.211 --> 00:18:43.352]  They don't have my phone.
[00:18:44.353 --> 00:18:47.535]  And I didn't talk to Trump for over a year before January 6th.
[00:18:47.996 --> 00:18:48.636]  That's a fact.
[00:18:48.776 --> 00:18:50.158]  And they know that.
[00:18:51.052 --> 00:18:59.155]  So them trying to tie my phone to this is preposterous and is ridiculous, but they only want to cover for the general public.
[00:18:59.175 --> 00:19:02.377]  So everybody kept asking, how are you handling 47 million dollar verdicts?
[00:19:02.737 --> 00:19:04.838]  How are you handling being demonized all over the news?
[00:19:04.878 --> 00:19:07.059]  And I said, they see me as a populist leader.
[00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:10.591]  They see me as someone that represents the people, that can mobilize folks.
[00:19:10.931 --> 00:19:11.952]  They're coming for Trump.
[00:19:12.172 --> 00:19:13.192]  They're coming for you.
[00:19:13.532 --> 00:19:14.573]  They're coming for everybody.
[00:19:14.913 --> 00:19:17.194]  I didn't get upset by the kangaroo court.
[00:19:17.794 --> 00:19:19.655]  I didn't get upset by the fraudulent rulings.
[00:19:19.835 --> 00:19:24.796]  I got upset, as I told you, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and today, before this happened.
[00:19:25.177 --> 00:19:27.578]  I've done four shows, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and today.
[00:19:28.058 --> 00:19:28.658]  This is the fifth.
[00:19:29.338 --> 00:19:36.141]  I said, it's the signification of the dangerous waters we're in that gets me upset and gives me chills.
[00:19:37.293 --> 00:19:38.215]  Up and down my spine.
[00:19:39.056 --> 00:19:39.858]  We need the governors.
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:41.981]  We need the legislatures.
[00:19:43.063 --> 00:19:45.888]  We need the political pundits to say no more.
[00:19:46.689 --> 00:19:48.192]  Stop this attempt at deep state.
[00:19:48.613 --> 00:19:49.534]  Just Department coup.
[00:19:51.038 --> 00:19:57.581]  And I got to tell you, if they think they're going to arrest Trump, if they think they're going to start a civil war, I don't want to fight with the military.
[00:19:58.161 --> 00:20:00.442]  I don't want to fight with the FBI, HRT.
[00:20:00.902 --> 00:20:02.023]  I'm not going to lead armies.
[00:20:02.463 --> 00:20:04.764]  If there's terror attacks, I'm not involved in it.
[00:20:05.184 --> 00:20:06.265]  It'll be the deep state doing it.
[00:20:06.625 --> 00:20:09.086]  And it's not because I don't think we could beat the military.
[00:20:09.786 --> 00:20:10.667]  The North Vietnamese did.
[00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:12.799]  The Afghans did.
[00:20:13.259 --> 00:20:23.342]  It's not that I want to fight with the FBI, it's that the globalists want to bring America down with a civil war as part of the Great Reset and have it collapse the global economy.
[00:20:23.782 --> 00:20:31.124]  So I asked the FBI, and I asked Army Special Operations, and the Navy SEALs, and all these groups that are going to be giving these orders.
[00:20:32.545 --> 00:20:37.026]  I'm not telling you what to think or do, but I think you're smart enough to know how dangerous this is.
[00:20:38.575 --> 00:20:45.041]  And I can tell you, a lot of really important powerful people are really upset about what's happening and worried about the future of America and the world.
[00:20:45.741 --> 00:20:49.084]  There's actually some good people in the power structure as well, but they're a minority.
[00:20:49.765 --> 00:21:01.836]  There are too many people following orders, too many people going along to get along, and we don't want a civil war, we don't want violence, we decry violence, even if they assassinate Trump, even if they arrest Trump.
[00:21:02.898 --> 00:21:03.879]  We don't want violence.
[00:21:03.979 --> 00:21:06.702]  It's going to blow up in their face politically if they do it.
[00:21:07.222 --> 00:21:10.766]  If they kill me, or they put me in prison, I don't want violence in my name.
[00:21:11.166 --> 00:21:12.427]  This is a time to be Christ-like.
[00:21:13.028 --> 00:21:20.915]  And not because Christ, or those that imitated what he did, Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, not because Christ was a wimp, he was the opposite.
[00:21:21.556 --> 00:21:25.119]  There's a time to reap, a time to sow, a time to live, a time to die.
[00:21:26.266 --> 00:21:27.587]  Time for war and time for peace.
[00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:29.767]  And we're winning politically.
[00:21:29.847 --> 00:21:30.928]  We're winning spiritually.
[00:21:31.188 --> 00:21:32.328]  We're winning culturally.
[00:21:32.668 --> 00:21:33.729]  Hollywood's collapsing.
[00:21:33.949 --> 00:21:34.889]  The left's collapsing.
[00:21:35.149 --> 00:21:39.791]  Their whole New World Order is going down and they want to trick us into a fight.
[00:21:40.951 --> 00:21:44.993]  And there's a very good chance, as I said months ago, they're going to car bomb Trump.
[00:21:46.408 --> 00:21:48.750]  They'll probably car bomb or shoot Biden as well.
[00:21:49.371 --> 00:21:55.016]  They'll blame Trump being killed on the left wing, Biden being killed on the right wing, to start a civil war.
[00:21:55.456 --> 00:21:57.378]  We do not want that.
[00:21:58.519 --> 00:22:09.749]  We want to stabilize the country, stabilize the borders, stabilize the country, stabilize the military, and not let Klaus Schwab and Specter, that's what they are, manipulate us into this.
[00:22:10.947 --> 00:22:14.229]  We won't win when Black Lives Matter kills cops.
[00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.072]  We won't win if some right-winger bombs an FBI building.
[00:22:18.693 --> 00:22:19.173]  We lose.
[00:22:20.174 --> 00:22:24.757]  We need to come together and be smart about what's happening and not be part of this.
[00:22:25.658 --> 00:22:30.702]  They already provocateured us on January 6th, but we're smarter now and we understand what's happening.
[00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:32.643]  But Trump's the real deal.
[00:22:33.944 --> 00:22:38.148]  He's not perfect, but he cares about America and really wants to be president and he wants to be in charge.
[00:22:38.508 --> 00:22:39.629]  That's enough to make them hate him.
[00:22:40.629 --> 00:22:41.970]  So now, don't be cowards.
[00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:43.872]  Back Trump more than ever.
[00:22:43.992 --> 00:22:45.273]  Back InfoWars more than ever.
[00:22:46.314 --> 00:22:47.795]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:22:47.855 --> 00:22:48.536]  Buy products.
[00:22:49.497 --> 00:22:50.277]  Keep us on air.
[00:22:50.377 --> 00:22:51.058]  Share the articles.
[00:22:51.098 --> 00:22:51.678]  Share the videos.
[00:22:51.978 --> 00:22:52.698]  Take this video.
[00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:59.522]  We're going to post a Banned.Video at Infowars.com and share it on your email, your text message, your Facebook, everywhere.
[00:22:59.562 --> 00:23:00.542]  Who cares if you get banned?
[00:23:01.002 --> 00:23:06.044]  Now is the time to be heard and to speak out and call for peace and call for justice.
[00:23:06.305 --> 00:23:13.388]  We have Hunter Biden with Chinese spies commanding him, the head of Chinese intelligence, and hookers, and little kids, and crack.
[00:23:14.048 --> 00:23:15.888]  And we have Biden taking money from Ukraine.
[00:23:16.388 --> 00:23:18.609]  And we have the child trafficking and the open borders.
[00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:22.349]  And we have all the crimes of the Democratic Party, but they don't get in trouble.
[00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:30.531]  Instead, they tell you Alex Jones and Roger Stone and Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are the enemies because we're not the enemies.
[00:23:30.571 --> 00:23:32.911]  We care about you because we care about ourselves.
[00:23:33.391 --> 00:23:37.832]  If my children are going to grow up in a free country, your children have got to grow up in a free country.
[00:23:38.492 --> 00:23:43.273]  So we need to be very smart and very peaceful, but very aggressive.
[00:23:44.053 --> 00:23:46.114]  Politically and with our speech now.
[00:23:46.494 --> 00:23:48.235]  Now's the time for open rallies in the streets.
[00:23:48.695 --> 00:23:50.636]  Now's the time to call and talk radio and C-SPAN.
[00:23:50.917 --> 00:23:55.499]  Now's the time to surround the White House and chant, we know you're a puppet of China and the New World Order.
[00:23:55.959 --> 00:23:58.540]  Now is the time to expose new lockdowns are coming.
[00:23:58.941 --> 00:24:09.626]  Now is the time because there is a deep state New World Order coup that knows Trump won the landslide and doesn't want him to run again and can read the political tea leaves.
[00:24:10.226 --> 00:24:14.778]   This is a globalist, deep state coup It's a spiritual coup.
[00:24:14.838 --> 00:24:15.798]  It's a military coup.
[00:24:15.858 --> 00:24:16.739]  It's a cultural coup.
[00:24:16.779 --> 00:24:17.759]  It's a financial coup.
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.861]  And we've got to counter it with the truth.
[00:24:22.042 --> 00:24:23.983]  Every day InfoWars is on the air as precious.
[00:24:24.883 --> 00:24:25.864]  It can't be taken for granted.
[00:24:26.844 --> 00:24:28.725]  So I want to encourage and thank you all for your support.
[00:24:28.765 --> 00:24:33.608]  But know, in our 28-year history together, this is the most important time ever.
[00:24:34.148 --> 00:24:37.770]  There are times in history where more happens in a month than happened in 100 years.
[00:24:38.150 --> 00:24:42.433]  And we're entering that period right now, the great turning, the fourth turning.
[00:24:43.248 --> 00:24:44.369]  Infowars.com.
[00:24:44.729 --> 00:24:45.529]  Banned on video.
[00:24:46.129 --> 00:24:48.370]  People keep saying, how are you handling it, Alex?
[00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:49.571]  The attacks, the lies.
[00:24:49.651 --> 00:24:52.072]  I look up and I go, you know they're about to have a coup.
[00:24:52.612 --> 00:24:53.913]  You know they're about to turn the power off.
[00:24:54.293 --> 00:24:55.774]  You know they're about to bring in martial law.
[00:24:56.194 --> 00:25:01.896]  You know that I'm not... I am totally worried about myself, but we're in a boat together.
[00:25:03.337 --> 00:25:07.159]  And people better get out of their comfort zones, and people better realize that.
[00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:12.832]  Especially the fools that are serving the shycoms and the globalists to bring down this country.
[00:25:13.092 --> 00:25:14.253]  Who do you think you're going to be?
[00:25:15.854 --> 00:25:20.456]  Throwing away your birthright, throwing away all your freedoms, throwing away checks and balances.
[00:25:21.557 --> 00:25:27.080]  They raided the real president of the US over some records they claim he can't have.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.502]  You know the law, the president can have any records he wants when he was in office.
[00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:32.864]  Again, this is such a dark time.
[00:25:36.442 --> 00:25:38.303]  It's so crazy how criminal these people are.
[00:25:38.323 --> 00:25:45.048]  I just thank God that we discovered their attempted coup on January 6th, their attempt to get us into more violence.
[00:25:45.309 --> 00:25:49.592]  We were able to shut most of it down because January 6th, as bad as it was, was a dud.
[00:25:50.814 --> 00:26:18.001]  It was a failure, and this criminal political class knows they're a bunch of child traffickers, knows they're a bunch of narcotics dealers, knows they're a bunch of money launderers, and they know their house of cards is coming down, so they're cornered, and this is their violent, aggressive, dangerous, out-of-control move, because they own the corporate media, and they own the Justice Department, and many of the courts, and almost all the prosecutors, because of George Soros, and they think they can get away with it, but they can't.
[00:26:18.922 --> 00:26:22.268]   If you simply speak out, Will Infowars be taken off the air?
[00:26:22.608 --> 00:26:23.989]  Will President Trump be assassinated?
[00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:25.451]  It really is up to you.
[00:26:26.932 --> 00:26:28.473]  Peacefully be an army of one.
[00:26:28.793 --> 00:26:30.154]  Stand out with a sign on the street corner.
[00:26:31.836 --> 00:26:33.557]  With a sign that you think is the most important message.
[00:26:34.578 --> 00:26:35.819]  Spread the word about Infowars.
[00:26:35.919 --> 00:26:37.660]  Join us tomorrow at 8 a.m.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.522]  with Harrison Smith and myself at 11 a.m.
[00:26:39.562 --> 00:26:41.283]  and Owen Troyer at 3 p.m.
[00:26:41.784 --> 00:26:45.487]  And know, every day we're still on air is so incredibly precious.
[00:26:45.807 --> 00:26:49.450]  In my 28 years on air, this is the biggest development yet.
[00:26:50.438 --> 00:26:51.720]  The real president of the U.S.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:27:06.356]   raided by a Justice Department SWAT team to frustrate the will of the voters of America because they know No amount of dead people voting, no amount of illegals voting, can stop any of this.
[00:27:07.016 --> 00:27:08.937]  It's beyond a raid on Trump.
[00:27:09.397 --> 00:27:12.178]  It is a deep state coup against America.
[00:27:12.818 --> 00:27:14.619]  A deep state coup against your freedom.
[00:27:15.159 --> 00:27:17.340]  A deep state coup against all that's decent.
[00:27:18.021 --> 00:27:22.222]  Please, take this video, once it's a banned out video, and share it to everyone you know.
[00:27:22.943 --> 00:27:26.624]  I'll see you, Lord willing, tomorrow, 11am central.
[00:27:27.183 --> 00:27:29.183]  God bless and good luck.
[00:27:29.183 --> 00:27:39.183]  [Music]
[00:27:39.183 --> 00:27:42.373]  People say Alex John's crazy. He's a conspiracy theory guy.
[00:27:42.373 --> 00:27:45.183]  He's a nutcase. He's got these rants and all that.
[00:27:46.001 --> 00:27:53.164]  What they miss is that this guy is ahead of the curve on so many different topics of signal, not noise.
[00:27:53.284 --> 00:28:04.557]   If you look at the signal and you compare that To PBS and NPR and BBC and we'll do what Alex Jones put out there versus what your collective body has put out there.
[00:28:04.577 --> 00:28:09.359]  And if you're a sentient human being and just watching it, you say, well, God, Alex Jones was ahead of this.
[00:28:09.399 --> 00:28:10.580]  Not only that, he kind of explained it.
[00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.462]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[00:28:14.102 --> 00:28:14.982]  That is very rare.
[00:28:15.022 --> 00:28:17.404]  You got to go back almost to the revolutionary generation.
[00:28:18.164 --> 00:28:18.625]  And see that.
[00:28:19.225 --> 00:28:22.769]  In this new book, I gotta tell you, when Tony Lyons first approached me, I read this thing.
[00:28:22.809 --> 00:28:24.030]  I go, this is it.
[00:28:24.571 --> 00:28:25.552]  This is no beatry.
[00:28:26.213 --> 00:28:27.434]  You're not gonna be flipping pages here.
[00:28:27.454 --> 00:28:28.635]  You're gonna be having a pen out.
[00:28:28.675 --> 00:28:29.736]  You're gonna be underlying stuff.
[00:28:30.057 --> 00:28:32.559]  The Great Reset by Alex Jones.
