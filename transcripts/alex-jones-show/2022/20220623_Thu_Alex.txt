[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.590]  You know where the CIA tunes in, right?
[00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:02.931]  You know where the Russians tune in?
[00:00:02.971 --> 00:00:04.031]  You know where everybody tunes in, right?
[00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:05.432]  You know who Tucker Carlson tunes in to?
[00:00:05.452 --> 00:00:06.232]  And Joe Rogan?
[00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:06.953]  Elon Musk?
[00:00:07.113 --> 00:00:08.194]  You know where they tune in, right?
[00:00:08.454 --> 00:00:11.435]  They tune in right here!
[00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:13.817]  InfoWars.
[00:00:14.197 --> 00:00:15.057]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:15.198 --> 00:00:32.118]  today.
[00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.952]  Tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:43.540]  This is a tale about an unprejudiced heart, and how it changed our Valia forever.
[00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.284]  That's fine for the purpose.
[00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:48.265]  How much do I owe you?
[00:00:48.345 --> 00:00:49.306]  It's a runt, Harry.
[00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:51.125]  just a worthless little runt.
[00:00:51.125 --> 00:00:53.125]  [Grunting]
[00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:55.125]  [Screaming]
[00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:57.125]  [Grunting]
[00:00:57.125 --> 00:00:59.125]  [Growling]
[00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.125]  [Growling]
[00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.125]  [Growling]
[00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.126]  [Growling]
[00:01:05.126 --> 00:01:09.126]   The pig and the farmer regarded each other
[00:01:09.814 --> 00:01:13.098]  And for a fleeting moment, something passed between them.
[00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.900]  Bill Gates wants you dead.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.521]  He's on record.
[00:01:17.483 --> 00:01:23.884]   We've been militarily targeted by the globalists for a long, long, long, long time.
[00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:36.123]   I'm not into bestiality, but I do like Mr. Ed, and she looks like Mr. Ed.
[00:01:36.314 --> 00:01:37.275]  They're making shit up!
[00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:39.057]  They keep saying I'm taking horse dewormer!
[00:01:39.117 --> 00:01:40.659]  I literally got it from a doctor!
[00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.370]  Hey, hey.
[00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.871]  Hi, guys.
[00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:45.391]  How you doing?
[00:01:46.711 --> 00:01:49.252]  Hi, Dr. Fauci.
[00:01:49.412 --> 00:01:50.633]  Something is going on.
[00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:52.574]  You've got to eat bugs or worms.
[00:01:52.614 --> 00:01:53.154]  You know why?
[00:01:53.194 --> 00:01:54.554]  Because Bill told you to.
[00:01:54.754 --> 00:01:56.555]  A wonderful source of cheap protein.
[00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:57.956]  I'm in a bad mood, man.
[00:01:58.196 --> 00:01:59.836]  Bill Gates, that piece of garbage!
[00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:03.318]  And all the stuff he's done to innocent people makes me want to throw up!
[00:02:03.478 --> 00:02:03.698]  Hello.
[00:02:04.338 --> 00:02:04.998]  I'm Bill Gates.
[00:02:05.138 --> 00:02:08.440]  When I was growing up, my parents were always involved in Planned Parenthood.
[00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.221]  An issue that really grabbed me as urgent were issues related to population.
[00:02:13.241 --> 00:02:14.602]  I'm sick of being social engineer!
[00:02:14.622 --> 00:02:15.422]  It's not funny!
[00:02:15.622 --> 00:02:21.524]  And we're taking things that are genetically modified organisms and we're injecting them in little kids' arms.
[00:02:21.644 --> 00:02:23.105]  We just shoot them right into the vein.
[00:02:24.025 --> 00:02:25.707]  A bunch of criminals coming down on us!
[00:02:25.787 --> 00:02:30.711]  Bill's such a fan of farmland, he's now the biggest owner of farmland in America!
[00:02:30.731 --> 00:02:35.815]  The Great Reset is the brainchild of a guy called Klaus Schwab.
[00:02:36.075 --> 00:02:38.117]  He's a totalitarian cat.
[00:02:39.438 --> 00:02:43.121]  It is I, Klaus, leading the Great Reset.
[00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:48.861]   Our plan, to make you eat the bugs and happily own the nothing.
[00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:52.062]  I am hero!
[00:02:52.062 --> 00:02:55.860]  And rolling up I'm a hero till the morning light!
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.262]  Girl, you gotta love your man.
[00:03:02.262 --> 00:03:04.841]  (upbeat music)
[00:03:04.712 --> 00:03:06.974]  Girl, you gotta love your man.
[00:03:07.774 --> 00:03:09.295]  Take him by the hand.
[00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:11.857]  Take him by the hand.
[00:03:12.497 --> 00:03:13.938]  Make him understand.
[00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.560]  Make him understand.
[00:03:19.122 --> 00:03:28.122]   The world on you depends, our life will never end Gotta love your man, yeah
[00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:34.546]   It's Thursday, June 23rd, 20- I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:03:34.687 --> 00:03:37.348]  And man, we have a broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:03:37.388 --> 00:03:44.311]  I'm going to tell you all about it when we come back in the next segment and join a lot of the hundreds of radio stations that carry this broadcast.
[00:03:44.331 --> 00:03:48.973]  But I just want to thank all of you watching on InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:03:48.993 --> 00:03:49.993]  And of course, Bandot Video.
[00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:53.215]  I want to encourage you to remember this is a participation sport.
[00:03:53.715 --> 00:03:55.276]  This is not a spectator sport.
[00:03:56.076 --> 00:04:06.182]  All of the enemy's plans rest on keeping the public in the dark, so when you spread the word and share the live links on your email, your text messages, word of mouth, it overrides their tyranny and does an incredible job.
[00:04:06.962 --> 00:04:11.225]  And we are so close to defeating them, so they are unveiling their whole plan.
[00:04:11.625 --> 00:04:25.598]   They've got human animal cloning big news, big war in Russia, Ukraine, energy news, massive Great Reset news, incredibly important Second Amendment news, There is just so much to cover today.
[00:04:25.618 --> 00:04:27.460]  It is truly massive.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.400]  Roe v. Wade.
[00:04:29.161 --> 00:04:30.402]  Supreme Court ruling imminent.
[00:04:30.422 --> 00:04:33.364]  Supreme Court just overturned gun control in New York.
[00:04:33.804 --> 00:04:35.386]  Massively positive ruling.
[00:04:35.746 --> 00:04:38.668]  The best we've seen in modern times from the Supreme Court.
[00:04:39.288 --> 00:04:41.130]  So that's cause for celebration.
[00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.772]  There is just so much to cover here today.
[00:04:44.812 --> 00:04:46.253]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:04:47.054 --> 00:04:53.257]  The UN says they need billions of dollars to feed starving people because of the supply chain breakdowns caused by the lockdowns and inflation.
[00:04:54.397 --> 00:04:58.099]  It's all coming up today on this Thursday, live broadcast.
[00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.100]  Your call, special guest, and a lot more.
[00:05:01.761 --> 00:05:03.401]  Remember, you're not supposed to be watching this show.
[00:05:03.441 --> 00:05:04.602]  The enemy hates it for a reason.
[00:05:05.142 --> 00:05:08.884]  Because we've got the answers, ladies and gentlemen, to defeat the new world order.
[00:05:09.344 --> 00:05:09.904]  Stay with us.
[00:05:10.044 --> 00:05:11.225]  Infowars.com.
[00:05:11.265 --> 00:05:12.505]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:05:13.826 --> 00:05:16.067]  Make no mistake, we're in a battle for the future.
[00:05:17.113 --> 00:05:24.517]  The future of humanity itself and InfoWars is the tip of the tip of the spear in the danger zone.
[00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:35.284]  And there's not any place I'd rather be than right here talking to millions of you amazing people of a race, color, and creed.
[00:05:35.984 --> 00:05:36.705]  It is beautiful.
[00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:52.094]   And we welcome you all and we salute you again for your spirit, And your determination for freedom and liberty, together with God's Spirit, we are indomitable!
[00:05:52.514 --> 00:05:54.216]  We are invincible!
[00:05:55.037 --> 00:05:56.398]  We are dauntless!
[00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:58.841]  We are victory!
[00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:02.845]  Alright, my friends.
[00:06:04.207 --> 00:06:05.729]  It is incredible what's happening.
[00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:21.798]  We are witnessing the concerted attack of the globalists to collapse the world economy, smash nation-states, dissolve borders, annihilate the cities, implode the currency, launch massive crime.
[00:06:21.818 --> 00:06:23.939]  I mean, this is it.
[00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:30.503]  And all of it hinges on the public not being aware of who's behind it and what their endgame is.
[00:06:30.983 --> 00:06:32.304]  But it's a paradox.
[00:06:33.464 --> 00:06:36.406]  Simultaneously, they're in the news saying, ban beef.
[00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.012]  If we can't ban cars, ban gas stations.
[00:06:40.052 --> 00:06:41.273]  That's happening in California.
[00:06:42.314 --> 00:06:43.074]  It's all in the stacks.
[00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:47.718]  Simultaneously, they say pedophilia is good, but oh, there are no pedophiles.
[00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:51.361]  World government's here, but nobody wants world government.
[00:06:53.342 --> 00:07:08.308]  Because as they run their cult and build their organizations and their operations, and collapse society and take it over, enriching themselves and impoverishing us so they can control us, they simultaneously gaslight us and say, nobody's imploding the border, there's no caravans coming.
[00:07:09.768 --> 00:07:16.031]  There's no inflation, there's no... Well, Coke drag queen story time's a good thing, so they're convicted pedophiles.
[00:07:18.806 --> 00:07:20.927]  And it goes on and on and on.
[00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:25.250]  When the left occupies capitals and breaks things, it's stunning and brave.
[00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:31.413]  But when a few thousand people out of a million do it, the DC capital, it's insurrection.
[00:07:35.395 --> 00:07:41.639]  We are not on the edge of the precipice anymore of sliding into the new world order.
[00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:45.841]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are free fall.
[00:07:47.406 --> 00:07:55.449]  And I'll quote that famous Beatles song, Helter Skelter, I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you.
[00:07:57.649 --> 00:07:58.290]  Think about that.
[00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.711]  The system wants to implode things to control us.
[00:08:03.351 --> 00:08:04.652]  That's what tyrants always do.
[00:08:04.672 --> 00:08:05.612]  That's their instinct.
[00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.413]  But it always ends up bringing them down.
[00:08:08.513 --> 00:08:10.113]  So here's what we're going to be covering today.
[00:08:12.234 --> 00:08:14.915]  We're going to be opening the phones up as well.
[00:08:17.193 --> 00:08:33.306]  But we have the designed Great Reset Global Collapse stack that is massive and that is unbelievably critical with the Fed chairman admitting that inflation was not caused by the Russia invasion and it was caused by monetary policy and spending.
[00:08:35.902 --> 00:08:41.826]  And we have the UN saying the global food crisis is going to kill millions and millions of people, which they themselves engineered.
[00:08:42.246 --> 00:08:45.748]  And we have the announcements again of banning beef, shutting off the gas.
[00:08:46.528 --> 00:08:48.349]  Biden admitting it's part of a transition.
[00:08:48.369 --> 00:08:52.412]  But his mother said you got to go through pain first before you have something better.
[00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.833]  But they're not giving us anything to transition to.
[00:08:56.774 --> 00:08:57.615]  We got that stat.
[00:08:58.775 --> 00:09:02.139]  Then we've got this incredible stack that really is our top story.
[00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:06.704]  The UN is preparing a new global pandemic announcement.
[00:09:07.265 --> 00:09:15.674]  Biden said on Monday that a new pandemic is coming and that it's imminent.
[00:09:15.814 --> 00:09:18.878]  And Jiminy Crickets, here it is.
[00:09:20.612 --> 00:09:38.882]  WHO, AP reports, considers declaring monkeypox a global health emergency with the mask, the lockdowns and everything, the accoutrement, the, uh, festoonage that comes with it.
[00:09:38.902 --> 00:09:44.425]  Oh, and they've got the first polio outbreak.
[00:09:44.445 --> 00:09:48.127]  Oh, oh, of course, in the UK, so that they want an emergency for that.
[00:09:49.051 --> 00:10:01.174]  Right as they announce toddlers ages six months and up to be given the deadly mRNA gene takeover nanotech poison but folks are fighting back against it.
[00:10:01.794 --> 00:10:03.254]  We've got so much on that front.
[00:10:03.314 --> 00:10:19.552]   A major, major British Medical Journal study out that is so bombshell that the word bombshell is overused but I mean this is bomb Shell, this is hydrogen bomb big.
[00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:30.478]  Collating all the data our guests have already, we've had top statisticians on, top scientists, top doctors, insurance company executives, Wall Street executives, all telling you the same damn thing.
[00:10:31.439 --> 00:10:39.952]   But now it's the British Medical Journal saying, The shots kill way more people and maim way more people than they protect.
[00:10:40.913 --> 00:10:47.119]  Even with the Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and J&J fake data, and it's come out in court, those were fake studies.
[00:10:47.399 --> 00:11:05.021]   So with fake data, with their data claiming it's good and 30% efficacy and all this other crap, They admit it is dozens of times more dangerous to take the shot than for any benefit you might get.
[00:11:05.561 --> 00:11:09.944]  And when you take out the fake data, it's really bad.
[00:11:11.526 --> 00:11:16.389]  So that alone is unbelievable.
[00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:25.950]   And that's only, I've got 30 something articles right here, just on the COVID tyranny takeover that's about to go into
[00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:27.089]  high gear again.
[00:11:27.089 --> 00:11:35.009]  That's two of the stacks.
[00:11:35.186 --> 00:11:36.387]  We got the global reset.
[00:11:36.747 --> 00:11:37.387]  We got the COVID.
[00:11:37.587 --> 00:11:38.488]  Next phase, the tyranny.
[00:11:39.108 --> 00:11:44.930]  And then we've got genetically edited humans, cows, you name it.
[00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:49.652]  FDA approves first CRISPR edited mammals.
[00:11:50.492 --> 00:11:55.434]  And that ties into a bunch of other AI news and the transhumanist revolution we're going to be hitting.
[00:11:56.874 --> 00:11:58.535]  And then we move on over here.
[00:11:59.416 --> 00:12:06.861]  Germany elevates risk to highest level of national gas emergency plan in the war with Russia.
[00:12:08.582 --> 00:12:12.405]  We've got the big abortion ruling that's set to come out and the left running around terrorizing everybody.
[00:12:12.425 --> 00:12:17.468]  We have a huge Second Amendment ruling by the Supreme Court that's unprecedented.
[00:12:17.488 --> 00:12:20.170]  That's pro-Second Amendment.
[00:12:21.571 --> 00:12:37.248]   And I also want to spend some time on this because I didn't come out and say Uvalde might be a false flag or an inside job because I hadn't seen the evidence of it and I wanted to believe in Texas law enforcement.
[00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.991]  And this is one of the times where Alex Jones is not always right.
[00:12:41.132 --> 00:12:43.593]  Alex Jones was right, he's not always right.
[00:12:43.994 --> 00:12:50.179]  I apologized a few weeks ago before I left town on a vacation, a workcation, and I said I was wrong.
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.202]  Well now, now...
[00:12:55.035 --> 00:12:58.618]  Now we have some of the surveillance footage.
[00:12:58.678 --> 00:12:59.819]  Now we have the statements.
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.161]  Now we have a 77-minute stand-down.
[00:13:02.922 --> 00:13:04.563]  And now we know we were lied to.
[00:13:04.843 --> 00:13:09.567]  And even the head of the DPS says it is egregious, the cover-up that's ongoing.
[00:13:09.928 --> 00:13:12.410]  So you can say whatever you want about Yuvaldi.
[00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.052]  Because they're covering it up and we don't know and none of it makes sense.
[00:13:16.532 --> 00:13:22.555]  And you look at the time we are in this country and the left that I predicted false flags.
[00:13:22.935 --> 00:13:26.517]  So I will say that Uvalde is an open case.
[00:13:28.798 --> 00:13:33.060]  And just like I said, Jesse Smollett didn't add up.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:33.780]  It doesn't add up.
[00:13:35.521 --> 00:13:36.682]  Now, what are they covering up?
[00:13:36.762 --> 00:13:37.362]  We're not sure.
[00:13:38.396 --> 00:13:43.680]  But if you believe police stood down for 77 minutes, I got an Easter Bunny, I'm ready to sell you.
[00:13:46.822 --> 00:13:48.023]  I mean, this is sick.
[00:13:48.643 --> 00:13:57.830]  And you've got McConaughey, who's their new deep state darling, Bill Clinton 2.0, and how they're maneuvering and all, and where they chose it at the end of school, and they're going to demolish the school and all of it.
[00:13:59.611 --> 00:14:01.472]  I will be going to Uvalde to investigate.
[00:14:01.512 --> 00:14:02.893]  They don't want us investigating.
[00:14:02.933 --> 00:14:04.174]  They don't want us looking into it.
[00:14:05.315 --> 00:14:06.076]  I'm going to Uvalde.
[00:14:07.885 --> 00:14:08.486]  Very, very soon.
[00:14:08.506 --> 00:14:11.949]  And I'm going to talk to locals, and I'm just going to put it all out.
[00:14:12.189 --> 00:14:12.910]  Just what they say.
[00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:23.299]  I'm going to go there, and I'm going to announce when I'm coming, and we'll have a rally point for the truth, and people can just come and talk, and they'll be able to be heard.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.961]  I'm not going to give my commentary, really.
[00:14:26.442 --> 00:14:28.964]  I'm just going to hear from them, because we've been hearing from the locals.
[00:14:29.465 --> 00:14:31.406]  And let me tell you, it ain't good, folks.
[00:14:32.407 --> 00:14:34.049]  Looks like Operation Northwoods to me.
[00:14:36.849 --> 00:14:39.130]  You can't stop them!
[00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:40.911]  I'll be right back.
[00:14:40.931 --> 00:14:42.632]  Alright, let me do this right now.
[00:14:42.652 --> 00:14:45.173]  And then I'll let all the news.
[00:14:46.754 --> 00:14:48.715]  I'm gonna do some mid-air refueling.
[00:14:51.496 --> 00:14:55.318]  No one can deny that InfoWars is the symbol of resistance.
[00:14:55.899 --> 00:14:57.860]  Human resistance against transhumanism.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.241]  Human resistance against the Great Reset.
[00:15:00.741 --> 00:15:02.502]  Human resistance against the New World Order.
[00:15:03.523 --> 00:15:11.826]   And nowhere Can you bet with your energy, your time, your psychic energy through prayer on a better place than this?
[00:15:12.547 --> 00:15:13.307]  I bet on you.
[00:15:13.567 --> 00:15:14.388]  I believe in you.
[00:15:14.608 --> 00:15:15.469]  I believe in myself.
[00:15:15.609 --> 00:15:16.529]  I know God's real.
[00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:27.477]  And I need you to just realize what we've done is the heart, is the fulcrum, is the center of the resistance.
[00:15:28.978 --> 00:15:36.111]   And I want you to let that sink in and I want to remind you That it takes money to prosecute a war.
[00:15:37.091 --> 00:15:37.931]  And we're in a war.
[00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:48.654]  And I've taken on the biggest and most powerful corrupt organizations and individuals and groups that serve Satan, because I serve the real God.
[00:15:49.674 --> 00:15:53.735]  But God works through you, and we can't do this without you.
[00:15:53.775 --> 00:15:55.376]  So I want to encourage everybody.
[00:15:56.107 --> 00:16:01.471]  To go to Infowarsstore.com and get the Alex Jones was right shirt and start your adventure with that out in public.
[00:16:01.531 --> 00:16:02.231]  It'll be amazing.
[00:16:02.552 --> 00:16:03.392]  You'll get mainly love.
[00:16:03.412 --> 00:16:06.174]  You'll get some hate, but it also supports the broadcast.
[00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:11.618]  I want to encourage you to go to Infowarsstore.com and get books and films like 2000 mules.
[00:16:11.878 --> 00:16:12.959]  So it's in your library.
[00:16:13.679 --> 00:16:18.719]   And I want to encourage you to go there because the sales got it in today for the ultimate
[00:16:18.719 --> 00:16:24.079]   immune system booster with our four best products that are on record documented to boost your

[00:16:31.558 --> 00:16:35.959]  X2 by itself, very close to selling out for 40% off.
[00:16:35.959 --> 00:16:41.239]   And they held back more for auto ship because when you sign up for auto ship on your next
[00:16:41.239 --> 00:16:46.718]   order, you don't just get 10% off, they hold back items that are going to sell out just
[00:16:46.718 --> 00:16:49.639]  so you get fulfilled.
[00:16:49.639 --> 00:16:53.319]  And they did the accounting and they held back 1100 bottles.
[00:16:53.372 --> 00:16:55.253]  Vitamineral Fusion has been sold out for six months.
[00:16:55.854 --> 00:16:57.876]  Reportedly going to be back in July.
[00:17:00.578 --> 00:17:04.041]  Supply chain breakdowns, who knows, but that's what we've got to forecast.
[00:17:05.463 --> 00:17:10.808]  50,000 canisters of it that will help fund the operation is so tasty and so good and all the vitamins, all the minerals, everything you need.
[00:17:12.544 --> 00:17:15.186]  1,124 bottles were found yesterday.
[00:17:15.206 --> 00:17:18.068]  They were in the warehouse, but I had a full inventory done.
[00:17:18.449 --> 00:17:21.411]  They're like, yeah, we held back more from auto ship than was needed.
[00:17:22.832 --> 00:17:31.360]  And so we have 1,100 bottles of it available in a flash sale at infowarstore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139.

[00:17:36.584 --> 00:17:40.471]   And then separately, During the break I heard a radio ad.
[00:17:40.531 --> 00:17:42.936]  TV viewers didn't see it, but radio listeners heard it.
[00:17:44.199 --> 00:17:44.419]  For...

[00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:32.507]  And that sale must end today, because two of the items are about to sell out.
[00:19:32.567 --> 00:19:39.249]  So guaranteed, that sale will be down tomorrow, because we don't sell something we don't have in stock.
[00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.170]  All right, let's just stop right there.
[00:19:43.643 --> 00:19:44.463]  We're on a break in three minutes.
[00:19:45.984 --> 00:20:01.093]  And I'm really trying to summon my greatest oratory capacity to properly address you, not just with the facts, but with what we face.
[00:20:01.914 --> 00:20:04.095]  And I'm telling you, I'm a big boy.
[00:20:07.057 --> 00:20:12.860]  And every fleshly instinct I've got is to shut this down and disappear now.
[00:20:14.195 --> 00:20:21.758]  But I know that's the flesh, that's an animal that's fearful, not the spirit that God gave me that is a spirit of overcoming and a spirit of power.
[00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:28.241]  My spirit says, stay on air, fight to the end, never back off, never give in.
[00:20:29.682 --> 00:20:48.912]   And so my message to you is not just one of temporal analysis and numbers, which are horrible, devastating, frightening, horrifying, demoralizing, But the left is going to get burned way worse than we are because we're at least partially prepared.
[00:20:49.272 --> 00:20:50.073]  You know what's coming.
[00:20:50.473 --> 00:20:53.415]  And knowing what's coming and understanding what's coming is half the battle.
[00:20:54.216 --> 00:20:55.156]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:20:55.817 --> 00:20:56.157]  Literally.
[00:20:57.498 --> 00:21:00.580]  So, I tried to stop this.
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.621]  You tried to stop this.
[00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:03.262]  We worked so hard to try to stop this.
[00:21:03.922 --> 00:21:04.843]  This ain't getting stopped.
[00:21:05.604 --> 00:21:08.626]  It's like being in a parking lot and some crazy schizophrenic comes up.
[00:21:08.746 --> 00:21:09.827]  I've had it happen a couple times.
[00:21:10.587 --> 00:21:11.668]  And they pull a knife out.
[00:21:12.884 --> 00:21:18.670]  And they won't leave you alone, and you're like, damn it, I gotta open a can of whoop-ass and hurt this son of a bitch real bad.
[00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:20.552]  And you do what you gotta do.
[00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:26.978]  And you're just at that point when you really kick somebody's ass, it's not thinking about kicking their ass.
[00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.541]  It's about, you gonna do it.
[00:21:31.043 --> 00:21:43.134]   Well, we're not gonna beat anybody's ass here, but I'm saying politically, We didn't ask for this, we didn't do this, we're in this, and we're just gonna have to decide to do it.
[00:21:44.596 --> 00:21:51.181]  And to culturally and spiritually and economically break with these people and just get ready.
[00:21:51.981 --> 00:22:02.649]  Because baby, baby, baby, baby, let me tell ya, you better get your butts ready with God right now.
[00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.772]  Because there is no way this gets reversed now.
[00:22:07.697 --> 00:22:11.178]  There's no way, sweetheart, we turn this around.
[00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:14.419]  We can mitigate how bad it's going to get, but we're in it now.
[00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:14.999]  Stay with us.
[00:22:15.539 --> 00:22:17.019]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:19.020]  All right, let's cut to the chase here.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.401]  Let's do it this way.
[00:22:21.461 --> 00:22:24.141]  Let's just look at these headlines first, and I'll play these clips.
[00:22:25.162 --> 00:22:32.944]  Barron's reports global food crisis will kill millions by disease health executive warrants.
[00:22:33.284 --> 00:22:34.464]  The very people that orchestrated it.
[00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:47.242]  Biden Economic Advisor asserts that more government spending will solve inflation, which a five-year-old that knows economy or economics will understand is the opposite.
[00:22:47.262 --> 00:22:52.904]  It's like saying throwing more dry wood on a fire that's already going will make the fire go out.
[00:22:56.145 --> 00:22:58.626]  Or filling your gas tank up will make the car run out of gas.
[00:22:59.646 --> 00:23:03.327]  Or shooting yourself in the head will be good for you.
[00:23:04.798 --> 00:23:11.284]  And we have the Fed chairman throwing Biden on the bus, admitting that it wasn't Putin that caused the inflation.
[00:23:11.704 --> 00:23:12.825]  What is that really all about?
[00:23:12.845 --> 00:23:15.147]  That's rats leaving the sinking ship.
[00:23:15.187 --> 00:23:16.288]  We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.251]  And then these type of headlines.
[00:23:19.732 --> 00:23:21.313]  Treating Beef Like Coal.
[00:23:21.373 --> 00:23:23.115]  This is the Rothschild-owned publication.
[00:23:24.116 --> 00:23:24.716]  The Economist.
[00:23:25.116 --> 00:23:28.937]  Treating beef like coal would make a big dent in greenhouse gas emissions.
[00:23:28.997 --> 00:23:29.357]  Yes.
[00:23:30.177 --> 00:23:31.598]  Can't have those cows farting.
[00:23:32.058 --> 00:23:35.519]  A pound of grasshoppers is three times as nutritious as a pound of beef.
[00:23:36.019 --> 00:23:37.119]  That's what the left's putting out.
[00:23:37.199 --> 00:23:37.919]  Told you that was coming.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:40.860]  And it goes on from there.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:45.781]  Biden vows to end fossil fuels again and take cars off the road.
[00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:46.581]  Got that clip.
[00:23:48.481 --> 00:23:50.142]  That's just some of the economic news.
[00:23:51.101 --> 00:23:53.143]  We're going to be getting to, but bottom line is this.
[00:23:53.743 --> 00:23:59.267]  This is organized economic warfare against me, against you, against our families.
[00:23:59.287 --> 00:24:00.929]  It doesn't matter what color you are.
[00:24:00.949 --> 00:24:02.890]  It doesn't matter what your sexual preference is.
[00:24:02.910 --> 00:24:04.532]  It doesn't matter where you live.
[00:24:04.832 --> 00:24:06.093]  It's a new world order.
[00:24:06.773 --> 00:24:11.757]  It's a big club, as Carlin said, and we ain't in it.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:16.341]  And again, that's why I go back to Biden.
[00:24:17.606 --> 00:24:21.187]  Yeah, the Federal Reserve blaming Biden and Biden blaming the Federal Reserve.
[00:24:21.747 --> 00:24:28.789]  That's because the public thinks the Federal Reserve is in power or that Biden's in power when they're all just puppets of the same big central private banks.
[00:24:29.409 --> 00:24:38.171]  And so they're now blaming each other, which is part of the plan, instead of blaming those on top of them that ran these policies and brought in the Great Reset.
[00:24:38.471 --> 00:24:39.572]  Yeah, they're functionaries.
[00:24:39.892 --> 00:24:41.152]  Yeah, they're high-level gophers.
[00:24:41.532 --> 00:24:44.853]  But they're only executives for the owners.
[00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:51.564]  The owners of the system that are eugenicists that want to depopulate you and your family.
[00:24:51.604 --> 00:25:09.797]  So here is Biden being reversed by the head of the Federal Reserve, Powell, saying no inflation, saying no inflation was high before, certainly before the war in Ukraine broke out, which is a true statement.
[00:25:09.817 --> 00:25:10.118]  Here it is.
[00:25:10.751 --> 00:25:17.994]  Given how inflation has escalated over the past 18 months, would you say that the war in Ukraine is the primary driver of inflation in America?
[00:25:18.714 --> 00:25:22.796]  No, inflation was high before, certainly before the war in Ukraine broke out.
[00:25:24.457 --> 00:25:28.619]  We also have, we have the clips, would you like me to bore you with them?
[00:25:28.699 --> 00:25:29.659]  I just showed you the headlines.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.242]  With the Biden administration saying inflation's coming down, first they told you a year and a half ago there wasn't inflation.
[00:25:36.862 --> 00:25:38.903]  Then they said there was small inflation, then it was good.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:48.522]  And now they say there's high inflation, but it's the American people's fault, and fossil fuels' fault, which they've cut off, causing much of the inflation.
[00:25:48.762 --> 00:25:50.163]  That's what exacerbated this.
[00:25:51.343 --> 00:25:59.125]  Not just overprinting of money, but cutting energy off, which then drove up the price of the very fundamental driver of the economy.
[00:26:00.426 --> 00:26:09.108]  There's the Fed chairman saying, what we're looking for is a compelling evidence that inflation is coming down, and we don't have that.
[00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:13.413]  Translated, it ain't coming down, baby.
[00:26:13.753 --> 00:26:14.753]  It's going up.
[00:26:14.753 --> 00:26:15.753]  [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[00:26:15.753 --> 00:26:16.632]  Sorry, the rest of your question--
[00:26:16.632 --> 00:26:19.273]  Well, are there positive signs of prices stabilizing?
[00:26:19.273 --> 00:26:27.033]   So in terms of prices stabilizing, what we're looking for is compelling evidence
[00:26:27.033 --> 00:26:28.272]  that inflation is coming down.
[00:26:28.272 --> 00:26:29.233]  And we don't have that.
[00:26:29.233 --> 00:26:31.432]  So nothing I could point to says that we have that.
[00:26:31.432 --> 00:26:33.632]  [END PLAYBACK]
[00:26:33.632 --> 00:26:40.073]   So now let's go to a clip with emergency services all over the US.
[00:26:39.781 --> 00:26:47.866]  Fire departments, police departments don't have money to respond to many calls because they don't have it in their budget for gasoline.
[00:26:48.526 --> 00:26:49.967]  That equals Road Warrior.
[00:26:50.347 --> 00:26:52.148]  That equals collapse of society.
[00:26:52.468 --> 00:26:54.169]  Mad Max beyond Thunderdome.
[00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.870]  Here it is.
[00:26:55.230 --> 00:27:02.634]  What happens when important emergency services that are already spread thin from a couple years of the pandemic can't even afford to fill up their tanks?
[00:27:03.459 --> 00:27:09.785]  Becoming a bigger problem in some parts of the country, forcing some fire departments and EMS services to limit the kinds of calls they can respond to.
[00:27:09.925 --> 00:27:13.669]  The high cost of fuel isn't just making your commute more expensive.
[00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:18.734]  It's also forcing emergency responders in smaller communities to cut costs.
[00:27:18.914 --> 00:27:22.078]  For some, it means not responding to non-emergency calls.
[00:27:22.398 --> 00:27:24.280]  For others, cutting back on patrols.
[00:27:24.339 --> 00:27:27.339]  building inspections and training courses for staff.
[00:27:27.339 --> 00:27:31.039]  Today, the average cost of a gallon of regular gas in the U.S.
[00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:33.039]  at a whopping $5.
[00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:36.438]   That price tag expected to climb further in the summer months.
[00:27:36.438 --> 00:27:40.439]   The surge impacting larger emergency response departments too,
[00:27:40.439 --> 00:27:41.839]  but not in the same way.
[00:27:41.839 --> 00:27:45.740]   I spoke with departments across the country who told me they're already having to
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:50.038]   or will have to make big sacrifices to offset the cost of gas.
[00:27:50.038 --> 00:27:53.538]  We've never seen costs like this since I've been sheriff.
[00:27:53.538 --> 00:27:57.539]   We're at 100% usage of our allotted fuel budget for this budget year already.
[00:27:57.733 --> 00:28:01.236]  I'm worried about the state of emergency response agencies throughout the nation.
[00:28:01.356 --> 00:28:04.179]  One of the things we're doing today is we call it No Drive Friday.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:09.104]  So the crews aren't really allowed to leave the station unless it's an emergency.
[00:28:09.884 --> 00:28:14.589]  We're also trying to reduce the number of vehicles that we send on an emergency response.
[00:28:14.969 --> 00:28:19.694]  Decreased spending, purchasing new equipment, or possibly some of our maintenance items for the year.
[00:28:19.995 --> 00:28:24.800]  Those pre-disaster or pre-emergency activities that are labeled as non-emergency.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:33.710]  We're predicting a minimum of an $800,000 to $1 million countywide fleet vehicle increase in the fuel costs.
[00:28:34.391 --> 00:28:36.333]  And that cost is going to be astronomical.
[00:28:37.188 --> 00:28:45.631]  So this has all been laid out by the World Economic Forum and the globalists where they said we're going to cut the energy off and have climate lockdowns because there won't be energy.
[00:28:47.071 --> 00:28:48.711]  They're coming after everything.
[00:28:49.732 --> 00:28:59.215]  And then MSNBC comes out and says calm down and back off and stop complaining about high gas prices.
[00:28:59.235 --> 00:29:10.035]   So they're just rubbing it in and saying, and then Biden says, I have the clip, Biden said yesterday, well his mom talked about having to go through pain before things got better.
[00:29:10.055 --> 00:29:11.016]  This is a transition.
[00:29:11.577 --> 00:29:12.958]  It's on purpose.
[00:29:14.299 --> 00:29:18.802]  There's all these headlines about Biden pledges to lower gas prices without increasing output.
[00:29:19.122 --> 00:29:20.523]  He shuts off the output.
[00:29:23.085 --> 00:29:24.967]  Russia massively increases output.
[00:29:25.027 --> 00:29:25.928]  Venezuela does.
[00:29:26.808 --> 00:29:30.551]  China is going to build all the solar panels and electric car batteries.
[00:29:30.671 --> 00:29:33.333]  It's all designed as economic war.
[00:29:33.694 --> 00:29:35.235]  It's the globalists doing it.
[00:29:36.209 --> 00:29:37.350]  They have deals with Russia.
[00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.452]  They have deals with China.
[00:29:38.732 --> 00:29:40.074]  This is a giant screw job.
[00:29:40.394 --> 00:29:45.760]  And while you hear about Russia is the enemy of the New World Order, it's in bed with all of it, folks.
[00:29:47.402 --> 00:29:47.923]  Unbelievable.
[00:29:48.443 --> 00:29:48.984]  So here it is.
[00:29:49.024 --> 00:29:50.265]  Calm down and back off.
[00:29:50.606 --> 00:29:51.006]  Here it is.
[00:29:51.427 --> 00:29:52.328]  Where we are right now?
[00:29:54.161 --> 00:29:59.226]  You know, I'm just going to say this, and if I get banged for it, I don't care.
[00:29:59.246 --> 00:30:06.993]  There's a great deal of Americans where it is uncomfortable that they're spending more, but they are not going to go under.
[00:30:07.394 --> 00:30:16.683]  You know, you've got to stop complaining when there's so many people who literally the inflation rate means they may only have two meals instead of three.
[00:30:17.023 --> 00:30:21.606]  There are Americans who did extremely well in the last two years in the market.
[00:30:21.846 --> 00:30:23.247]  You still have your job.
[00:30:23.527 --> 00:30:26.029]  And yeah, it's costing you more for gas, but guess what?
[00:30:26.069 --> 00:30:28.970]  You're still gonna take that holiday, that 4th of July vacation.
[00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.131]  You can still eat out.
[00:30:30.571 --> 00:30:41.418]  So I'm gonna need you to calm down and back off, because it feeds into this fear, and then this fear feeds into people making decisions that creates the very thing that they're fearful of.
[00:30:42.258 --> 00:30:47.707]   So they implement the policies of killing Hundreds of thousands of drilling permits.
[00:30:47.747 --> 00:30:49.868]  They kill drilling in Alaska.
[00:30:49.888 --> 00:30:54.149]  They kill new oil coming in with the Keystone Pipeline out of Canada.
[00:30:54.909 --> 00:30:56.489]  They kill Gulf of Mexico drilling.
[00:30:57.169 --> 00:31:01.430]  They put regulations on the coal plants and shut the rest of them down.
[00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:04.330]  And then we have rolling blackouts and all this and they go, hey!
[00:31:04.911 --> 00:31:06.131]  Stop complaining!
[00:31:06.291 --> 00:31:07.291]  Back off!
[00:31:08.931 --> 00:31:10.812]  This is a transition.
[00:31:11.032 --> 00:31:12.772]  Get used to it.
[00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:14.430]  You're being broken.
[00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:15.411]  You're being made poor.
[00:31:15.931 --> 00:31:18.813]  You have economic warfare being waged against you and your family.
[00:31:19.573 --> 00:31:21.754]  All right, that's a lot of the economic news.
[00:31:21.814 --> 00:31:23.115]  I only covered a fraction of it.
[00:31:23.155 --> 00:31:32.799]  I've got to hit the big Second Amendment ruling in that fight and what's happening with Roe v. Wade, about to be reportedly overturned.
[00:31:33.139 --> 00:31:37.582]  And then we'll hit the huge news on the new rollout of new lockdowns the U.N.
[00:31:37.622 --> 00:31:38.342]  has announced.
[00:31:38.582 --> 00:31:38.942]  It's here.
[00:31:39.262 --> 00:31:40.343]  So we'll tell you about that next hour.
[00:31:41.687 --> 00:31:43.888]  Your calls are coming up in the second and third hour.
[00:31:45.749 --> 00:31:47.269]  Massive amounts of news to cover.
[00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:53.532]  We're going to get into the COVID tyranny and so much more as well.
[00:31:54.752 --> 00:31:57.433]  But first, we're going to hit the Supreme Court ruling on the Second Amendment.
[00:31:58.554 --> 00:32:03.236]  And we're going to get into the Roe v. Wade imminent ruling and what that means.
[00:32:06.877 --> 00:32:07.858]  It's never going to get any better.
[00:32:08.258 --> 00:32:08.978]  Don't look for it.
[00:32:09.418 --> 00:32:10.499]  Be happy with what you got.
[00:32:11.681 --> 00:32:14.744]  Because the owners of this country don't want that.
[00:32:15.285 --> 00:32:16.946]  I'm talking about the real owners now.
[00:32:17.347 --> 00:32:18.388]  The real owners.
[00:32:18.468 --> 00:32:22.993]  The big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions.
[00:32:23.373 --> 00:32:24.594]  Forget the politicians.
[00:32:24.834 --> 00:32:28.098]  The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice.
[00:32:29.679 --> 00:32:30.140]  You don't.
[00:32:30.901 --> 00:32:31.882]  You have no choice.
[00:32:32.262 --> 00:32:33.203]  You have owners.
[00:32:33.503 --> 00:32:34.404]  They own you.
[00:32:35.757 --> 00:32:37.038]  They own everything.
[00:32:37.278 --> 00:32:38.920]  They own all the important land.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.042]  They own and control the corporations.
[00:32:41.062 --> 00:32:44.525]  They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the State Houses, the City Halls.
[00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:46.126]  They got the judges in their back pockets.
[00:32:46.467 --> 00:32:51.271]  And they own all the big media companies, so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear.
[00:32:51.451 --> 00:32:53.093]  They got you by the balls!
[00:32:54.582 --> 00:32:56.642]  They want obedient workers.
[00:32:57.103 --> 00:32:58.623]  Obedient workers.
[00:32:58.923 --> 00:33:11.626]  People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime, and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it.
[00:33:11.706 --> 00:33:14.947]  And now, they're coming for your social security money.
[00:33:15.407 --> 00:33:18.067]  So they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street.
[00:33:19.488 --> 00:33:20.388]  It's a big club.
[00:33:21.383 --> 00:33:22.083]  And you ain't in it.
[00:33:22.443 --> 00:33:27.746]  You said recently, quote, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.
[00:33:28.106 --> 00:33:28.986]  You better believe it.
[00:33:29.086 --> 00:33:30.947]  So what specifically did they do?
[00:33:31.407 --> 00:33:36.569]  If I ask them, if I need them, you know, most of the people on this stage I've given to, just so you understand.
[00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:37.390]  A lot of money.
[00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.731]  You and I are not in the big club.
[00:33:41.071 --> 00:33:43.012]  The owners of this country know the truth.
[00:33:43.652 --> 00:33:47.354]  It's called the American dream, because you have to be asleep to believe it.
[00:33:48.786 --> 00:33:50.267]  But I'll tell you what they don't want.
[00:33:50.647 --> 00:33:54.129]  They don't want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking.
[00:33:54.169 --> 00:33:58.092]  They don't want well-informed, well-educated people capable of critical thinking.
[00:33:58.112 --> 00:33:59.473]  They're not interested in that.
[00:33:59.493 --> 00:34:00.253]  That doesn't help them.
[00:34:00.654 --> 00:34:02.015]  That's against their interest.
[00:34:02.515 --> 00:34:02.935]  That's right.
[00:34:03.215 --> 00:34:08.179]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.

[00:36:09.718 --> 00:36:13.341]  And said, no, the Second Amendment says you have a right to keep and bear arms.
[00:36:13.721 --> 00:36:24.389]  And so you don't have to, in New York, go get the police chief or the sheriff to agree, because you've given them contributions or whatever the case is, that you have a right to own a gun.
[00:36:24.409 --> 00:36:31.455]  Because you run a liquor store, or you run a gas station, or a convenience store, or you work late at night as a wrecker driver.
[00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:37.099]  Why do you have to wait two, three, four years, maybe, when you're out there at 3 a.m.
[00:36:37.339 --> 00:36:46.162]  hauling cars away on the highway, or in dangerous areas that you can have a damn gun, while the politicians have their own bodyguards, while the police are armed?
[00:36:46.182 --> 00:36:52.385]  The Supreme Court says the Second Amendment guarantees the right to carry guns in public.
[00:36:53.385 --> 00:37:02.669]   The Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution provides a right to carry a gun outside the home, issuing a major decision on the meaning of the Second Amendment.
[00:37:03.929 --> 00:37:08.912]  The 6-3 ruling was the court's second important decision on the right to keep and bear arms.
[00:37:10.421 --> 00:37:21.845]  In a landmark 2008 decision, the court said that the first time that the amendment safeguards a person's right to possess firearms, although the decision was limiting to keeping guns at home for self-defense.
[00:37:21.885 --> 00:37:22.625]  That was the D.C.
[00:37:22.665 --> 00:37:22.945]  case.
[00:37:23.545 --> 00:37:30.828]  The court has now taken the ruling to the next step after years of ducking the issue and apply the second amendment beyond the limits of homeowner's property.
[00:37:31.468 --> 00:37:41.637]  The case involves New York law that requires showing a special need to get a permit to carry a concealed handgun in public, which is up to the bureaucrats to decide if you have that need.
[00:37:42.217 --> 00:37:49.123]  The state bans carrying handguns openly, but it also restricts those who apply for the concealed carry.
[00:37:52.721 --> 00:37:59.023]  Everybody knows you're trying to disarm the general public while you've got bodyguards, and everybody's sick of it.
[00:37:59.503 --> 00:38:10.006]  And so you send people to four of the Supreme Court justices' houses saying you're going to kill them, and two weeks later they come out and say, we've got a right to have guns.
[00:38:10.226 --> 00:38:18.589]  Because even though they've got federal marshals out there protecting them, you don't think Clarence Thomas, you don't think the others that got harassed at their houses don't have a gun?
[00:38:20.933 --> 00:38:33.263]  Clarence Thomas, I guarantee you, right next to his bed, in a drawer, I'd bet my right arm, has got a .357 Magnum, or a Glock 9mm, or a shotgun.
[00:38:35.484 --> 00:38:44.271]  I'll bet you my balls, that every damn one of them, including the leftists, have got a gun by their bed.
[00:38:44.311 --> 00:38:45.932]  Happy birthday, by the way, Clarence Thomas.
[00:38:45.953 --> 00:38:46.353]  Great guy.
[00:38:47.874 --> 00:38:48.855]  So that's where we are.
[00:38:50.302 --> 00:38:53.064]  Why does one group get guns and we don't get guns?
[00:38:53.084 --> 00:38:59.048]  Because some crazy person goes into a school and the police stand down for 77 minutes and lie about it?
[00:38:59.408 --> 00:39:01.590]  Shame on the police in Ubaldi!
[00:39:04.092 --> 00:39:05.693]  I don't get my guns taken!
[00:39:07.294 --> 00:39:12.117]  We got trained security that's got all the background for armed carry, amazing veterans, you name it here.
[00:39:12.898 --> 00:39:15.599]  But I got a gun right here just in case they fail.
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.321]  And I got a gun in my office.
[00:39:18.322 --> 00:39:25.006]  Just like I got a pen that's mightier than a sword, by the way, where I can write notes, and I got articles I can... a word processor.
[00:39:25.707 --> 00:39:26.627]  I'm in the info war.
[00:39:26.747 --> 00:39:28.468]  I'm not trying to use guns for offense.
[00:39:29.149 --> 00:39:40.055]  But you better bet your bottom dollar that I got guns, and I'm not a soft target, and I'm not rolling over to you bullies, and you leftists, and you communist criminals.
[00:39:40.156 --> 00:39:44.035]  Oh, you're all for gun control for us, but not for you.
[00:39:44.035 --> 00:39:54.356]   So we've got all that news and I've got more I'm going to say on Ubaldi next hour.
[00:39:54.356 --> 00:39:57.916]  And it's imminent with a Supreme Court ruling.
[00:39:58.219 --> 00:40:08.548]  Here's a little compilation of some of the left flipping out and what they're saying about shutting down the country if they're not allowed to kill babies in the third trimester.
[00:40:10.531 --> 00:40:17.531]  Regulate ejaculations!
[00:40:17.531 --> 00:40:20.331]  We didn't make this video gay!
[00:40:20.198 --> 00:40:22.480]  Not the church, not the state!
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.822]  Women must decide their fate!
[00:40:25.202 --> 00:40:27.403]  Not the church, not the state!
[00:40:27.744 --> 00:40:29.785]  Women must decide their fate!
[00:40:30.145 --> 00:40:32.387]  Not the church, not the state!
[00:40:32.727 --> 00:40:34.829]  Women must decide their fate!
[00:40:35.209 --> 00:40:37.471]  Not the church, not the state!
[00:40:37.811 --> 00:40:39.933]  Women must decide their fate!
[00:40:40.373 --> 00:40:45.235]  That we demand legal nationwide abortion.
[00:40:46.795 --> 00:40:55.099]  If they go forward with this draft and they overturn Roe, they will make clear they are illegitimate.
[00:40:57.319 --> 00:41:14.079]   And everyone with a heart for justice, everyone who loves women, who loves girls, who cares about LGBTQ siblings, who cares about all of humanity, Then they need to be with us!
[00:41:14.419 --> 00:41:15.980]  They need to stand up!
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.301]  They need to rise up!
[00:41:19.401 --> 00:41:24.684]  Here's the left taking over a major capital.
[00:41:24.704 --> 00:41:27.625]  This is called stunning and brave, but not an insurrection.
[00:41:29.546 --> 00:41:34.869]  They're already doing that with the Great Reset.
[00:41:34.929 --> 00:41:36.970]  They're already doing that with their whole New World Order.
[00:41:38.735 --> 00:41:46.559]  Pro-choice activists covered in fake blood deliver baby dolls to Amy Coney Barrett's home with fake blood dripping down their legs.
[00:41:47.099 --> 00:41:49.940]  What a bunch of freakazoid depopulationist idiots.
[00:41:50.801 --> 00:41:53.120]  Second hour, your phone calls and more. Straight ahead.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:42:04.201]   And it's time for humanity to stand up in the end for war and say, I don't know what's
[00:42:04.201 --> 00:42:06.640]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight.
[00:42:06.885 --> 00:42:09.047]  You better believe you got one!
[00:42:10.988 --> 00:42:15.988]   From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:42:15.988 --> 00:42:25.988]  [MUSIC]
[00:42:25.988 --> 00:42:35.988]  [MUSIC]
[00:42:35.988 --> 00:42:40.988]  [MUSIC]
[00:42:40.988 --> 00:42:45.988]   The FDA unanimously voted to authorize both the Pfizer and
[00:42:45.988 --> 00:42:51.988]   the Moderna vaccines for children as young as six months old.
[00:42:52.216 --> 00:42:56.717]  And the CDC joyfully recommends that every child get one.
[00:42:57.157 --> 00:43:01.618]  I know many parents with very young children have been anticipating this day.
[00:43:02.219 --> 00:43:11.041]  We now know, based on rigorous scientific review, that the vaccines available here in the United States can be used safely and effectively in children under five.
[00:43:11.821 --> 00:43:19.026]  Vaccinating young children is a critical opportunity to protect them against hospitalization and death from COVID-19.
[00:43:19.646 --> 00:43:23.669]  Parents, I strongly encourage you to get your children vaccinated.
[00:43:23.689 --> 00:43:37.498]  The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines involve the radical new mRNA technology that we now know is spreading throughout the entire body and altering the person's DNA.
[00:43:40.376 --> 00:43:48.001]  Thousands of medical doctors have been speaking out about this, including one of the inventors of mRNA technology.
[00:43:48.882 --> 00:43:54.225]  Several nations have suspended these vaccines due to serious injuries and deaths.
[00:43:54.965 --> 00:44:02.050]  And yet, we are still being lied to by our own government, who wants us to sacrifice our youngest child.
[00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:06.432]  My name is Dr. Ashish Jha and I am the White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator.
[00:44:06.592 --> 00:44:08.173]  I have some really exciting news.
[00:44:08.593 --> 00:44:13.595]  The FDA and the CDC just authorized vaccines for kids under 5.
[00:44:14.055 --> 00:44:15.816]  These vaccines are incredibly safe.
[00:44:16.336 --> 00:44:18.677]  They work to prevent serious illness.
[00:44:19.197 --> 00:44:22.379]  That's why I have gotten all three of my children vaccinated.
[00:44:22.799 --> 00:44:27.961]  And now if you're a parent of a kid under 5, this is a great time to go out and get your child protected.
[00:44:28.381 --> 00:44:29.242]  Get them vaccinated.
[00:44:30.689 --> 00:44:38.791]  The White House's official doctor has claimed that these vaccines are incredibly safe, which we know is a lie.
[00:44:40.011 --> 00:44:47.052]  There are more deadly side effects attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines than with any other vaccine in history.
[00:44:48.933 --> 00:44:54.634]  From severe allergic reactions to full-blown AIDS and sudden death.
[00:44:56.451 --> 00:45:05.753]  There is a well-documented risk of myocarditis in young men and adolescent boys, and severe blood clotting in young women.
[00:45:08.034 --> 00:45:12.435]  We have seen a massive increase in heart attacks and paralysis.
[00:45:14.996 --> 00:45:24.538]  The vaccinated keep getting sick, and it's now officially being reported that the more vaccinated you are, the more likely you are to get sick.
[00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:42.146]  We now know to expect late-onset effects from these vaccines, such as adverse immune response to infection, neurological disorders, autoimmune disease, and pregnancy-related problems.
[00:45:43.867 --> 00:45:48.610]  The vaccine was suspended in over a dozen countries because of massive blood clots.
[00:45:49.924 --> 00:46:00.830]  The UK reports a half a million deaths of the vaccinated, while the US is seeing a 20% increase in deaths and a 10% increase in disability.
[00:46:03.071 --> 00:46:12.117]  And even Pfizer has admitted in their own documents that these vaccines are causing just about every possible negative side effect imaginable.
[00:46:13.337 --> 00:46:17.840]  And our government wants every child in America to get these shots.
[00:46:20.077 --> 00:46:23.277]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:46:23.277 --> 00:46:52.637]  Alright, we're now into hour number two.
[00:46:52.637 --> 00:46:56.077]   And I've cleared the decks of guests so we can take a lot of calls today.
[00:46:56.087 --> 00:46:58.469]  We did a pretty good job yesterday, but didn't get to everybody I wanted to.
[00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.492]  So at the end of this segment, I'm going to give the number out.
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:10.745]  For first-time callers, long-time callers, people that agree, people that disagree, any topic you want to discuss, anything you want to get into.
[00:47:10.785 --> 00:47:14.907]  But I would ask, for those that want to comment, what do you make of the Great Reset?
[00:47:14.927 --> 00:47:16.508]  What do you make of the economic war that's going on?
[00:47:16.548 --> 00:47:21.431]  What do you make of saying six-month-olds and up now can take these experimental deadly shots?
[00:47:21.511 --> 00:47:22.932]  It's just incredible.
[00:47:23.412 --> 00:47:25.754]  I'd like to get your take on that as well.
[00:47:27.062 --> 00:47:29.784]  There's so much more we'll get to as we intersperse the calls.
[00:47:30.484 --> 00:47:37.889]  I've got a whole stack of human-animal cloning, a whole stack of transhumanism next level, the AI spies inside your house.
[00:47:38.229 --> 00:47:42.191]  This is a very important stack right here we'll be getting to the last segment of this hour.
[00:47:43.512 --> 00:47:46.314]  But the toll-free number to join us on air.
[00:47:48.428 --> 00:47:51.489]  He is.
[00:47:51.509 --> 00:47:52.589]  877-789-2539.
[00:47:52.609 --> 00:47:53.650]  877-789-Alex.
[00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.970]  877-789-2539.
[00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:58.191]  And I would love to hear from you.
[00:47:59.071 --> 00:48:01.912]  The last thing the system wants is us talking to each other.
[00:48:01.952 --> 00:48:08.473]  The last thing they want is you unfiltered giving out your views and your reports and your ideas.
[00:48:08.593 --> 00:48:12.494]  But I personally, and I know the rest of the listeners as well, love it.
[00:48:13.095 --> 00:48:14.515]  Exercising the First Amendment.
[00:48:15.908 --> 00:48:20.549]  In front of millions and millions and millions of people, that is powerful.
[00:48:20.569 --> 00:48:20.849]  877-789-2539.
[00:48:21.289 --> 00:48:28.691]  All right, a bunch of just really big news on the COVID front.
[00:48:28.711 --> 00:48:37.273]  It just gets bigger and bigger as the program of their evil becomes very clear, as we're now 30 plus months into it.
[00:48:37.713 --> 00:48:39.374]  Associated Press is reporting.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.804]  That they're on the verge of announcing a new global emergency and new pandemic.
[00:48:45.305 --> 00:48:49.589]  Now, used to, it was based on real cases and real numbers.
[00:48:49.649 --> 00:48:59.558]  But now, they can just say it's an emergency and a pandemic, and then institute all those powers that the UN has been trying to get nation states to sign on to, signing away their sovereignty.
[00:49:00.019 --> 00:49:05.914]   AP reports, World Health Organization considers declaring monkeypox a global health emergency.
[00:49:05.934 --> 00:49:15.982]  The World Health Organization convenes its emergency committee today to consider if the spiraling, the spiraling, don't give you numbers or scientific facts.
[00:49:16.283 --> 00:49:17.183]  It's very, very rare.
[00:49:18.364 --> 00:49:19.905]  Spiraling just sounds bad.
[00:49:20.305 --> 00:49:25.487]  The spiraling outbreak of monkeypox warrants being declared a global emergency.
[00:49:25.987 --> 00:49:38.551]  But some experts say the WHO's decision to act only after the disease spilled to the West could entrench the grotesque inequities that arose between the rich and poor countries during the coronavirus pandemic.
[00:49:39.011 --> 00:49:42.334]   So it has nothing to do with Is this really a threat?
[00:49:42.695 --> 00:49:43.597]  Why are they hyping it?
[00:49:43.617 --> 00:49:44.499]  Where did it come from?
[00:49:44.619 --> 00:49:46.322]  It's really a vaccine side effect.
[00:49:46.623 --> 00:49:47.905]  They admit it's identical to it.
[00:49:49.315 --> 00:49:51.477]  No, it's inequity!
[00:49:52.158 --> 00:49:55.741]  We're not giving enough money to the third world, which means to the United Nations.
[00:49:56.342 --> 00:50:07.912]  Declaring monkeypox to be a global emergency would mean the UN Health Agency considers the outbreak to be an extraordinary event, and the disease is at risk of spreading across even more borders, possibly requiring a global response.
[00:50:08.413 --> 00:50:13.938]  It would also give monkeypox the same distinction as COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing efforts to eradicate polio.
[00:50:14.418 --> 00:50:24.656]  So, the next lockdown, the next big emergency is here, as we predicted months ago, when they had the truck turnover in Pennsylvania with the monkeys on it.
[00:50:25.984 --> 00:50:34.130]  Here's The Sun reporting the first outbreak of highly infectious polio, which is again tied to the vaccine, they just call it that, detected in UK since 1984.
[00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:36.772]  And then this.
[00:50:37.553 --> 00:50:44.138]  Toddlers' tears as the nation's children begin to receive the COVID shots, the New York Post reports.
[00:50:44.798 --> 00:50:47.119]  Yes, the tears of having their immune systems erased.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.641]  The tears of blood clots and heart attacks and myocarditis.
[00:50:51.002 --> 00:50:58.166]  The tears of having their future destroyed with an experimental shot giving liability protection to the very eugenicists carrying it out.
[00:50:58.426 --> 00:51:07.291]  But who would believe they would do something like this to children so people under Stockholm Syndrome give in to it because they just can't face the real harm.
[00:51:08.612 --> 00:51:09.753]  Continuing, shameful!
[00:51:10.851 --> 00:51:14.815]  The American Academy of Pediatrics shills for COVID vaccine for children.
[00:51:14.855 --> 00:51:17.838]  Adon Salazar reports at InfoWars.com.
[00:51:17.858 --> 00:51:21.181]  And it goes through the fact that children don't get sick from COVID often.
[00:51:21.201 --> 00:51:22.522]  They never die from COVID.
[00:51:22.842 --> 00:51:25.825]  It's always a comorbidity of, you know, heart defect or cancer.
[00:51:26.666 --> 00:51:29.789]  And the vaccine isn't a vaccine.
[00:51:29.889 --> 00:51:30.590]  It doesn't work.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.161]  Why are they doing it?
[00:51:33.221 --> 00:51:43.645]  Because they're targeting our children to set the precedent to kill us and get away with it, and where it just becomes a background noise to see if they can get away with releasing even more deadly viruses in the future.
[00:51:43.925 --> 00:51:44.725]  But there's good news.
[00:51:45.866 --> 00:51:53.209]  Publix Pharmacy refuses to offer COVID vaccines to children under age 5.
[00:51:55.242 --> 00:52:00.285]  And Publix is obviously owned by a very conservative, patriotic family that's been a supporter of this broadcast.
[00:52:01.225 --> 00:52:02.746]  And there you go.
[00:52:02.766 --> 00:52:04.927]  They're now saying they will not take part of it.
[00:52:05.708 --> 00:52:15.933]  Representatives said the company would not offer the jab to its more than 1,200 stores, mainly in Florida, to children under age 5 at this time, adding they would not issue a formal statement on the decision.
[00:52:16.273 --> 00:52:19.335]  Good job to the owners of Publix.
[00:52:21.536 --> 00:52:25.098]  And DeSantis has come out and said, do not give it to under age five.
[00:52:25.518 --> 00:52:26.959]  Kudos to Governor DeSantis.
[00:52:27.359 --> 00:52:30.661]  By the way, that four minute clip we played of DeSantis was so powerful yesterday.
[00:52:31.321 --> 00:52:33.502]  It's posted at Bandai Video, but wow!
[00:52:34.142 --> 00:52:45.448]  No wonder I've got a whole stack of articles right here that DeSantis is now in every major national poll, including New Hampshire polls, way ahead of Trump.
[00:52:47.762 --> 00:52:48.402]  That's coming up.
[00:52:48.702 --> 00:52:52.304]  Yeah, Trump, it's horribly unpopular with your base.
[00:52:54.685 --> 00:53:03.369]  Your base can forgive you for being stampeded into it if you now come out against it, but you don't do it because you are pig-headed.
[00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:05.590]  Is Trump a bad person?
[00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.850]  No.
[00:53:06.151 --> 00:53:07.031]  Does Trump mean well?
[00:53:07.691 --> 00:53:08.352]  Absolutely.
[00:53:08.992 --> 00:53:12.994]  But man, you know some really smart people, you know, just got blind spots?
[00:53:13.254 --> 00:53:13.934]  I mean, I'm the same way.
[00:53:13.954 --> 00:53:15.035]  I got blind spots in my life.
[00:53:15.774 --> 00:53:17.215]  I have temper control problems.
[00:53:17.515 --> 00:53:27.958]  I'm not... Jesus said, let he who without sin cast the first stone.
[00:53:29.279 --> 00:53:31.559]  So I've done plenty of wrong by accident.
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:44.888]   I've been wrong plenty of times by accident, but never, never, never, never, never, Did I consciously screw anybody over?
[00:53:45.108 --> 00:53:46.848]  Did I ever break my promises?
[00:53:47.528 --> 00:53:47.888]  Never!
[00:53:48.168 --> 00:53:51.249]  That is my most valuable spiritual asset.
[00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:55.270]  And I didn't come by that asset realizing how valuable it was.
[00:53:55.330 --> 00:54:00.632]  It was ingrained in me, genetically, spiritually, historically, by nature and nurture.
[00:54:01.832 --> 00:54:04.393]  But I look around the world and I see the problem with leadership.
[00:54:05.553 --> 00:54:11.675]  And I see that most people don't get that doing the right thing, even when you're under heat, is the most valuable thing in the universe.
[00:54:12.568 --> 00:54:13.989]  Because we're following God's directives.
[00:54:14.149 --> 00:54:25.418]  And I'm so happy about Trump fighting China's corruption and getting better trade deals and securing the borders and being pro-gun and all the things he did were so good.
[00:54:25.438 --> 00:54:36.027]  But man, I look at DeSantis and he has just pulled way ahead of Trump because he's telling the truth and because he's resonating with the people.
[00:54:36.147 --> 00:54:40.050]  And I want Trump to wake up and be like that as well.
[00:54:41.852 --> 00:54:44.693]   But He's not doing it.
[00:54:44.693 --> 00:54:46.853]  And so it's a real shame.
[00:54:46.853 --> 00:54:49.492]  But you know, Trump's almost as old as Biden.
[00:54:49.492 --> 00:54:54.532]   And if he wants to put himself out to pasture, then that's his issue.
[00:54:54.532 --> 00:54:57.411]   Because I'm not trying to get a job at the Santas or a job with Trump.
[00:54:57.411 --> 00:54:59.173]  I'm trying to find the best person to back.
[00:54:59.173 --> 00:55:03.572]   And I'm just telling you, the Santas, I've gone from really liking the Santas to just,
[00:55:03.572 --> 00:55:06.932]  there's no way he's bad at the things he's doing.
[00:55:07.116 --> 00:55:08.957]  He is fighting them directly.
[00:55:09.577 --> 00:55:11.318]  He believes in his children and his wife.
[00:55:11.598 --> 00:55:12.498]  He believes in you.
[00:55:12.938 --> 00:55:16.360]  And he is taking them on because he's not an anti-human.
[00:55:16.519 --> 00:55:18.519]  And I'll just say this to Governor Santus.
[00:55:18.519 --> 00:55:25.519]  [claps]
[00:55:25.519 --> 00:55:28.519]  You got my back in baby.
[00:55:29.285 --> 00:55:31.026]  I am so proud of what you're doing.
[00:55:31.046 --> 00:55:33.567]  And I want to see a lot more of that.
[00:55:34.636 --> 00:55:35.616]  Just like Bolsonaro.
[00:55:36.156 --> 00:55:37.877]  Bolsonaro's way better than Trump.
[00:55:38.737 --> 00:55:45.258]  And as much as I like Trump, as much as I like the hope he put out, and as much as I like how he fought, Bolsonaro's better!
[00:55:45.898 --> 00:55:47.058]  Ron DeSantis is better!
[00:55:47.798 --> 00:55:49.059]  Victor Orban is better!
[00:55:50.259 --> 00:55:52.519]  And so, maybe Trump will hear that.
[00:55:53.339 --> 00:55:54.120]  I know they listen.
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:56:01.141]  Because I don't even try to sit there and talk to Trump, and be patted on the head in a conversation with him.
[00:56:02.341 --> 00:56:10.027]  I want Trump to man up and realize he's tied himself to a big loser with this poison shot, and he needs to pull out of this as quickly as possible.
[00:56:10.328 --> 00:56:11.248]  I got more to hit, though.
[00:56:11.268 --> 00:56:12.649]  The big COVID news when we come back.
[00:56:12.870 --> 00:56:13.410]  It's the biggest.
[00:56:13.790 --> 00:56:14.571]  I haven't gotten to it yet.
[00:56:14.611 --> 00:56:19.655]  Then write to your phone calls on this live Thursday, June 23rd broadcast.
[00:56:19.715 --> 00:56:20.636]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:56:21.036 --> 00:56:22.217]  InfoWars.com.
[00:56:22.818 --> 00:56:29.143]  InfoWars.com forward slash show to find all the forbidden links and to share them, because the globalists hope you don't.
[00:56:29.183 --> 00:56:29.663]  Stay with us.
[00:56:30.484 --> 00:56:40.076]  See, the globalists know their system of Ponzi schemes and derivatives and deflationary policies is coming to an end.
[00:56:40.676 --> 00:56:47.525]  So they want to blame you and blame COVID and collapse the world and bring in their new system on the back of it, but they're not going to get away with it.
[00:56:48.814 --> 00:56:52.555]  I'll go to your phone calls here in just a few minutes, but let's continue with these headlines.
[00:56:53.036 --> 00:56:57.837]  Covid vaccine's more likely to put you in the hospital than keep you out.
[00:56:58.017 --> 00:57:06.360]  British medical journal editor, not just a paper, the editor, analysis of Pfizer and Moderna data finds.
[00:57:07.201 --> 00:57:08.941]  Huge article, huge report.
[00:57:09.642 --> 00:57:11.282]  It's up at InfoWars.com.
[00:57:12.723 --> 00:57:13.803]  And here's the actual study.
[00:57:14.823 --> 00:57:16.044]  Serious adverse events.
[00:57:17.406 --> 00:57:21.127]  Of special interest following mRNA vaccination in random trials.
[00:57:23.707 --> 00:57:30.309]  The editor of the British Medical Journal with an index of trials.
[00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:41.952]  And even the Israeli News reports, BMJ senior editor, COVID vaccines more likely to put you in the hospital than keep you out.
[00:57:43.072 --> 00:57:43.512]  Wow!
[00:57:44.813 --> 00:57:48.034]  And their answer is, let's give it to six months old.
[00:57:50.435 --> 00:57:51.315]  That's what's incredible.
[00:57:51.995 --> 00:57:56.536]  And if you try to put this study out on Twitter or Instagram or Facebook, they block you.
[00:57:57.817 --> 00:58:10.780]  And the Pfizer CEO says he's almost certain Americans will have to take the new COVID vaccine every year that continues to erase your immune system and make you sicker and sicker and sicker.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.161]  Everybody I know getting sick took the shot.
[00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:16.492]  Remember this broke in the last few days.
[00:58:16.672 --> 00:58:20.495]  World Health Organization chief believes COVID did leak from a Wuhan lab.
[00:58:21.196 --> 00:58:25.939]  But if you try to share that, Big Tech will not let you do it.
[00:58:27.981 --> 00:58:29.182]  That's pretty amazing.
[00:58:29.222 --> 00:58:30.523]  And here's this meme going around.
[00:58:31.203 --> 00:58:35.987]  Shows a female doctor in her lab coat with cash hanging out of her pocket for Big Pharma.
[00:58:36.707 --> 00:58:43.833]  She says sudden adult death syndrome killed him as she's got the needle in her hand.
[00:58:45.219 --> 00:58:47.801]  Another great meme is Joe Biden licking an ice cream cone.
[00:58:49.182 --> 00:58:52.504]  They had it at that gay bar, Drag Queen Story Time, with little kids.
[00:58:53.125 --> 00:58:54.766]  It's not going to lick itself.
[00:58:57.387 --> 00:59:02.431]  Let me ask the question, how many kids did the Uvalde cops end up shooting?
[00:59:02.951 --> 00:59:05.413]  Their body cam footage has the answer.
[00:59:05.893 --> 00:59:09.036]  That's coming up after I take more of your phone calls.
[00:59:10.020 --> 00:59:12.301]  Or some of your phone calls I haven't gotten to yet today.
[00:59:12.841 --> 00:59:19.084]  Craig, Joe, DJ, Jordan, Robert, Eric, Brian, Alec, Tyler, Josh, and more.
[00:59:19.164 --> 00:59:23.666]  We're taking all your calls today in the order that they are received.
[00:59:24.086 --> 00:59:25.947]  First up, Craig in Ohio.
[00:59:26.047 --> 00:59:26.827]  Welcome, Craig.
[00:59:29.168 --> 00:59:29.609]  Hello, Alex.
[00:59:29.629 --> 00:59:29.949]  You there?
[00:59:30.249 --> 00:59:30.449]  I am.
[00:59:30.509 --> 00:59:30.789]  Go ahead.
[00:59:32.090 --> 00:59:32.370]  Oh, hey.
[00:59:33.830 --> 00:59:36.732]  So, I know our time's short, but I wanted to get right to this.
[00:59:38.041 --> 00:59:42.624]  Kind of running a parallel track with you for 25 plus years as an independent trader.
[00:59:43.624 --> 00:59:46.986]  And, you know, I hear you say, you know, you've been stabbing in the back for a long time.
[00:59:47.046 --> 00:59:48.787]  I feel like the same thing.
[00:59:49.187 --> 00:59:58.592]  When I traded in Chicago a long time ago, when I first got my start, I ran across a few people, developed a model that was able to take a real snapshot into the market.
[00:59:59.593 --> 01:00:05.116]  And on occasion, you get these energy buildup zones where they can't manipulate it.
[01:00:05.176 --> 01:00:06.356]  They can't cheat it, right?
[01:00:08.422 --> 01:00:14.587]  I can tell, it's a really hard thing to explain, but just like you say, Alex Jones is right.
[01:00:15.627 --> 01:00:17.809]  Sometimes I say Craig was right, not out of ego.
[01:00:21.292 --> 01:00:24.915]  Blown away by this glimpse you get into reality, right?
[01:00:24.935 --> 01:00:26.296]  These natural phenomena.
[01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.257]  You're a good carpenter.
[01:00:28.317 --> 01:00:31.299]  You know how to build a bed or a desk.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.762]  Or if you're a good marksman, you know how to teach people how to shoot.
[01:00:35.782 --> 01:00:37.984]  Or you're a great doctor or a great scientist.
[01:00:38.324 --> 01:00:41.026]  No, when you're right, you need to say, hey, I know how to do this.
[01:00:41.106 --> 01:00:41.967]  I'm a great farmer.
[01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:43.188]  I'm a great teacher.
[01:00:43.528 --> 01:00:44.408]  I'm a great pastor.
[01:00:45.049 --> 01:00:45.849]  I'm a great father.
[01:00:45.889 --> 01:00:46.450]  I'm a great mother.
[01:00:46.510 --> 01:00:55.278]   No, it's good when you're Yeah, I agree.
[01:00:55.338 --> 01:01:04.868]  And so, I don't want to come across with an ego, but what I do want to come across with some, you know, directness and force that, you know, I've seen things for 25 years.
[01:01:04.988 --> 01:01:06.870]  I've seen shenanigans go on, right?
[01:01:06.950 --> 01:01:08.531]  Manipulations, manipulations.
[01:01:08.571 --> 01:01:11.614]  You go back to long-term capital, Asian currency crisis, 2008.
[01:01:12.785 --> 01:01:13.766]  Just like Ed Dowd.
[01:01:13.806 --> 01:01:18.390]  And Ed Dowd, I just can't express how right he is on what he's saying.
[01:01:18.430 --> 01:01:20.051]  I've listened to him as much as I can.
[01:01:20.832 --> 01:01:22.694]  But he's from a research perspective, right?
[01:01:22.814 --> 01:01:29.179]  I see it from a slightly different perspective, from the trade perspective, where the actual money changes hands right in front of my face, right?
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:33.403]  And so, Ed sees it from a, okay, I have to be a contrarian.
[01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:33.963]  I understand.
[01:01:33.983 --> 01:01:34.944]  So you're a big trader.
[01:01:35.224 --> 01:01:35.825]  You're a smart guy.
[01:01:35.845 --> 01:01:36.666]  You've been right before.
[01:01:36.746 --> 01:01:37.807]  What do you see happening?
[01:01:38.807 --> 01:01:38.948]  Yeah.
[01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:44.572]  Well, what I see is the manipulation, Alex, have just ramped up over the last 25 years.
[01:01:44.953 --> 01:01:48.055]  Just, you know, non-linear, just exponentially, right?
[01:01:48.215 --> 01:01:52.958]  And right now we're in a spot where, you know, everybody wants to go to gold, right?
[01:01:52.998 --> 01:01:54.600]  Because they think it's a safety net.
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:58.242]  And I've been saying for a long time, look, we're deflationary, right?
[01:01:58.763 --> 01:02:03.166]  The only reason we have inflation is it's a synthetic-driven inflation, right?
[01:02:03.306 --> 01:02:05.487]  And so, and Ed doesn't disagree with this, right?
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:07.621]  Other people don't.
[01:02:08.101 --> 01:02:11.364]  A lot of people want to disagree with it, but the point of the matter is... It's okay.
[01:02:11.384 --> 01:02:12.045]  Give us your view.
[01:02:12.065 --> 01:02:13.547]  You don't need to preface it with what other people say.
[01:02:13.567 --> 01:02:14.207]  Give us your view.
[01:02:14.748 --> 01:02:14.928]  Yeah.
[01:02:15.268 --> 01:02:21.534]  So my view is that, you know, we are in very weird times, and you cannot bank on things that have happened in the past, right?
[01:02:21.574 --> 01:02:23.276]  So stocks go up, bonds go down.
[01:02:23.316 --> 01:02:24.697]  Bonds go up, stocks go down, right?
[01:02:24.737 --> 01:02:27.240]  Yeah, we're in a synthetic, totally manipulated market.
[01:02:28.331 --> 01:02:35.793]  Yes, and so the point of the matter is that don't bank on gold, everyone, because remember, they know you're long gold, right?
[01:02:35.833 --> 01:02:37.733]  They know you're betting on gold going up.
[01:02:37.813 --> 01:02:42.215]  So if these globes, and they are out there, Alex, they are out there.
[01:02:42.255 --> 01:02:43.975]  Don't you think we should be in everything?
[01:02:44.475 --> 01:02:51.477]  Some in real estate, if you have the money, crypto, some gold, silver, really politically engages where your money should be.
[01:02:51.557 --> 01:02:54.638]  I mean, I think diversification is the answer.
[01:02:54.658 --> 01:02:55.118]  What do you think?
[01:02:56.158 --> 01:03:02.262]  Well, you know, sometimes I disagree with that, because I think sometimes you have to take calculated bets.
[01:03:02.722 --> 01:03:07.566]  And you have to be convicted, and you have to stay with them, and you have to chop wood, chop wood, chop wood.
[01:03:07.586 --> 01:03:10.288]  Okay, Greg, give us your predictions with one and a half minutes left.
[01:03:10.308 --> 01:03:11.348]  Where do you think crypto is going?
[01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:18.273]  Well, I mean, so again, let me just read.
[01:03:18.866 --> 01:03:20.367]  Reiterate where I come from, right?
[01:03:20.747 --> 01:03:22.508]  We don't need to hear where you came from.
[01:03:23.209 --> 01:03:24.810]  We're almost out of time.
[01:03:24.870 --> 01:03:26.190]  I'm asking you, what are your predictions?
[01:03:27.691 --> 01:03:30.093]  Well, see Alex, it doesn't work like that, right?
[01:03:30.393 --> 01:03:31.874]  I'm not gonna predict.
[01:03:32.174 --> 01:03:36.216]  I can give you Craig's philosophy, but quantitatively, cyclically, right?
[01:03:36.336 --> 01:03:38.618]  I think this is a glimpse into God's world, right?
[01:03:38.658 --> 01:03:40.819]  When you look at the nature and the cycles of these things.
[01:03:41.229 --> 01:03:46.971]  When you get a signal, it just builds energy, and then you know where it's going to go, based off harmonic eighth levels.
[01:03:47.011 --> 01:03:48.031]  It's like music, right?
[01:03:48.051 --> 01:03:49.392]  It just is the way it is.
[01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:50.232]  Well, it's true.
[01:03:50.292 --> 01:03:53.933]  The NSA is following trends to try to jump on the trends.
[01:03:54.333 --> 01:03:57.354]  The system isn't even able to create trends.
[01:03:57.774 --> 01:03:58.855]  They jump on the trends.
[01:03:58.915 --> 01:03:59.675]  I appreciate your call.
[01:04:00.135 --> 01:04:02.476]  I think that's where you're going with this, but I'm not mad at you.
[01:04:03.056 --> 01:04:05.657]  I just don't want a nebulous statement here.
[01:04:06.297 --> 01:04:13.500]  Because we can sit there and talk about, okay, I've made a lot of predictions that are true, I've been really right, and then you don't want to tell us what you're saying is going on.
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.460]  None of us are perfect.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:16.281]  But that's okay.
[01:04:16.921 --> 01:04:19.902]  I want to get in this next 10-minute segment to at least four or five callers.
[01:04:19.942 --> 01:04:21.222]  So we're going to go on a break.
[01:04:21.883 --> 01:04:30.586]  We're going to come back in the order the calls are received and talk to Josh and talk to Joe and talk to Robert and Brian and Alec and so many others on the other side.
[01:04:30.626 --> 01:04:33.087]  What we know is there's an artificial cutoff of energy.
[01:04:33.854 --> 01:04:34.014]  Yes, sir.
[01:04:34.034 --> 01:04:34.394]  Mr. Jones.
[01:04:34.234 --> 01:04:38.274]   collapse the whole economy, they're going to bring in a new global world ID with carbon
[01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:41.634]  taxes, social credit score, with a vaccine passport.
[01:04:41.634 --> 01:04:43.534]  That's all admitted, that's here.
[01:04:43.534 --> 01:04:46.474]   And we should be debating what does that mean to the world economy?
[01:04:46.474 --> 01:04:47.474]  What does that mean to us individually?
[01:04:47.474 --> 01:04:49.634]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:04:49.634 --> 01:04:52.674]  Let's talk to Alec in North Carolina.
[01:04:52.674 --> 01:04:54.593]  Alec, you're on the air.
[01:04:54.593 --> 01:04:55.593]  Welcome, sir.
[01:04:55.593 --> 01:04:56.593]  Yes, sir.
[01:04:56.593 --> 01:04:57.593]  Mr. Jones.
[01:04:57.593 --> 01:04:58.593]  Yes, sir.
[01:04:58.593 --> 01:05:03.073]   Hey, I just wanted to let you know, man, I got the chills while I was waiting to talk
[01:05:03.073 --> 01:05:08.353]  to you because I mean it's been a long time coming.
[01:05:06.105 --> 01:05:11.307]  I'm a first-time caller, and I just want to... I just want to thank you for everything you do.
[01:05:11.828 --> 01:05:14.909]  So, first off, I wanted to mention, so, I joined the fight.
[01:05:15.849 --> 01:05:17.950]  Your courage is contagious, man.
[01:05:17.990 --> 01:05:20.511]  I put out a music video on YouTube.
[01:05:20.571 --> 01:05:25.674]  It's called, Everything, by Alec Anderson, A-L-E-C Anderson, and...
[01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:34.412]  YouTube will not let me promote it, so I thought, well, what better to do than call up the man who inspired me and promote it on air.
[01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:36.893]  Well, that's beautiful.
[01:05:36.973 --> 01:05:38.013]  What's the name of the video again?
[01:05:39.014 --> 01:05:41.775]  It's Everything by Alec Anderson.
[01:05:43.375 --> 01:05:43.955]  Well, look it up.
[01:05:44.195 --> 01:05:46.016]  Everything by Alec Anderson.
[01:05:46.036 --> 01:05:46.316]  Yes, sir.
[01:05:46.336 --> 01:05:46.776]  Yes, sir.
[01:05:47.196 --> 01:05:51.297]  So, yeah, so they won't let me promote it because they say sensitive subjects.
[01:05:51.377 --> 01:05:52.018]  You know what I mean?
[01:05:52.058 --> 01:05:53.378]  So I touch on everything.
[01:05:54.079 --> 01:05:54.679]  That's coming.
[01:05:54.699 --> 01:05:56.180]  You know, I'm just trying to warn people.
[01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:58.622]  Oh my gosh, sensitive subjects.
[01:05:58.662 --> 01:05:59.842]  You put it out a few days ago.
[01:06:00.303 --> 01:06:01.923]  How dare you try to talk to people?
[01:06:01.963 --> 01:06:02.944]  We can't let you talk.
[01:06:03.504 --> 01:06:03.644]  Why?
[01:06:03.684 --> 01:06:05.005]  It's a sensitive subject.
[01:06:05.305 --> 01:06:05.966]  We'll get your video.
[01:06:06.046 --> 01:06:11.629]  I haven't seen it yet, but I'm going to tell the crew to post it under the live show feed today at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:14.010]  Yeah, that would be amazing.
[01:06:14.451 --> 01:06:23.057]   So that brings me to what I was going to say is, you know, how contagious, you know, the courage can be, you know, coming out No, I agree.
[01:06:22.877 --> 01:06:26.236]   speaking out against all this stuff because like someone like you is who
[01:06:26.236 --> 01:06:31.277]   inspires me and then who knows who I can inspire you know and that ties back into
[01:06:31.277 --> 01:06:36.037]   what you were talking about earlier like this this great reset you know it's here
[01:06:36.037 --> 01:06:40.677]   man and we just need we just need to embrace it you know and just accept it
[01:06:40.677 --> 01:06:44.637]   you know and just keep put one foot in front of the other and keep fighting you
[01:06:44.637 --> 01:06:47.957]   know what I'm saying no I agree not embrace it as if we give
[01:06:47.957 --> 01:06:51.357]   into it but embrace we're in a fight and just deal with the fact we're in it and
[01:06:51.357 --> 01:06:56.757]  to ourselves. Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:06:54.957 --> 01:06:58.220]  So tell me about your song, Everything, Alec.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:02.343]  So yeah, so pretty much I tell it from two different perspectives.
[01:07:02.463 --> 01:07:15.314]  The first verse is my perspective and just talking about what's coming, you know, the collapse is coming, blah, blah, blah, and how I'm trying to warn people and there's a video to kind of narrate and go along with it.
[01:07:15.794 --> 01:07:17.696]  And then the second verse is somebody else.
[01:07:18.243 --> 01:07:22.707]  Who is pretty much the receiver of my message, but they didn't listen to me.
[01:07:22.807 --> 01:07:27.251]  Like, I tried to tell them the collapse is coming, get prepared, blah blah blah, and then here it is.
[01:07:27.591 --> 01:07:38.401]  You know, inflation, gas prices, food shortages, all that, and it's just pretty much them coming to the realization that, hey, you know, these people that were trying to warn me were right.
[01:07:39.139 --> 01:07:42.440]  And I shouldn't have looked at him in the negative light that I looked at him.
[01:07:42.801 --> 01:07:43.421]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:43.721 --> 01:07:44.902]  Well, I'm seeing your video.
[01:07:44.942 --> 01:07:45.762]  It looks really interesting.
[01:07:45.802 --> 01:07:46.582]  We're going to check it out.
[01:07:46.622 --> 01:08:01.228]  But regardless, your spirit of them suppressing your video, telling you you couldn't promote it, blocking it, and then getting into the show and promoting it, that spirit of not giving in to censorship and overpowering it is the answer, brother.
[01:08:01.248 --> 01:08:01.869]  And that's beautiful.
[01:08:01.889 --> 01:08:02.789]  Thank you so much, Alec.
[01:08:03.609 --> 01:08:04.870]  All right, let's take another call here.
[01:08:06.265 --> 01:08:12.825]   in the order they are received. Let's talk to a caller in New Jersey. Let's talk to Jonathan
[01:08:12.825 --> 01:08:16.425]   in New Jersey. The economic war and the great reset we're under. Go ahead.
[01:08:16.425 --> 01:08:27.144]   Hi Alex, it's actually Jordan. I'm sorry I misread it. Go ahead. Okay, so I just want to
[01:08:27.144 --> 01:08:32.425]   call and tie this into the, you know, the vaccine death shot.
[01:08:32.623 --> 01:08:34.165]  Death shot and also control shot.
[01:08:35.206 --> 01:08:36.187]  You might remember me.
[01:08:36.867 --> 01:08:46.116]  I'm actually currently cataloged under Bandot Video under May 27, 2021, former pharmaceutical representative, Warms of Vaccine Ingredients.
[01:08:47.217 --> 01:08:48.718]  I still stand by those comments.
[01:08:49.739 --> 01:08:51.401]  And I also talked to you in September.
[01:08:52.054 --> 01:08:55.036]  of last year about the Japanese revelations.
[01:08:55.536 --> 01:08:58.017]  By the way, you're not just Vindicant, I remember your call.
[01:08:58.657 --> 01:09:00.898]  It's all confirmed now, the British Medical Journal.
[01:09:02.579 --> 01:09:13.264]  Yes, and this is where I'd like to go, and you know, Jay Dyer talked about this, and it ties into what Bill Joy had talked about, about the future doesn't need us, right?
[01:09:13.785 --> 01:09:20.608]  And there was some decision amongst the elite that they don't need humanity anymore, and we don't really need to do these people, right?
[01:09:21.235 --> 01:09:29.200]  And so, you know, part of what this all is is that there is this fourth turning concept that they know about the rise and fall of these civilizations.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.663]  And they pumped this civilization up way beyond it could ever have ever been attained normally.
[01:09:34.863 --> 01:09:38.645]  And if you go look at the general public, myself included, they look like a bunch of zombie slobs.
[01:09:38.705 --> 01:09:40.446]  But the globalists are just as bad.
[01:09:40.846 --> 01:09:42.587]  So you don't have a right to kill all these people.
[01:09:42.647 --> 01:09:49.191]  Instead of leading them and inspiring them, they decided to dumb them down as much as possible so they're not players and then just get rid of them.
[01:09:50.686 --> 01:09:51.967]  Yes, and control them.
[01:09:52.067 --> 01:09:53.408]  They want full control.
[01:09:53.568 --> 01:09:57.472]  So anybody who doesn't live through this process, okay, people will die.
[01:09:57.732 --> 01:09:58.432]  And they are dying.
[01:09:58.753 --> 01:09:59.954]  But that's not their only goal.
[01:10:00.274 --> 01:10:02.676]  Their goal is to achieve this transhumanist mean.
[01:10:03.136 --> 01:10:05.558]  Now the question becomes, what have they told the apparatchiks?
[01:10:06.299 --> 01:10:07.840]  What have they told the AOC?
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:10.542]  What have they told these lower echelon people?
[01:10:10.562 --> 01:10:14.846]  We know they've told them the end of the world's coming and they've got to get positioned to save themselves.
[01:10:15.426 --> 01:10:17.428]  And so that's why they're so scared to go along with the agenda.
[01:10:18.561 --> 01:10:19.221]  But what is that?
[01:10:19.462 --> 01:10:20.863]  We still haven't found that out.
[01:10:21.103 --> 01:10:22.364]  And that's why... No, we do know.
[01:10:22.384 --> 01:10:28.448]  They say the carrying capacity of the Earth is over and the world will collapse and deadly viruses will come out of the jungle and kill everybody.
[01:10:29.168 --> 01:10:31.390]  They're really going to come out of labs and they've prepared the whole thing.
[01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:33.131]  So, I mean, they pretty much told us.
[01:10:33.491 --> 01:10:34.952]  You see them telling you everywhere.
[01:10:36.153 --> 01:10:37.714]  But what did they tell them, though?
[01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:38.635]  That they're going to be safe?
[01:10:38.995 --> 01:10:40.816]  That if they do what they're told, they'll be safe?
[01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:41.817]  Is that what they told them?
[01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:43.298]  That is exactly what they told them.
[01:10:44.369 --> 01:10:50.974]  Okay, so there's some other plan that these people are following, the core of which we need to find out.
[01:10:51.094 --> 01:10:55.598]  But the economic warfare is very important because it weakens the edifice, right?
[01:10:55.858 --> 01:10:57.699]  So that they can implement whatever it is.
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:06.205]  They want to take the fourth burning that's occurring and then take a giant leap, like Harari said, in evolution, okay?
[01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:09.371]  That's right.
[01:11:09.391 --> 01:11:18.613]  They want to use humanity and all of our knowledge and skill to build a breakaway civilization while they implode us and kill us.
[01:11:20.173 --> 01:11:20.513]  Correct.
[01:11:20.633 --> 01:11:27.475]  And to keep that larger theme up in mind and try to make that palatable, I think, is what one of your main missions is.
[01:11:27.895 --> 01:11:44.026]   And I've been championing that, and I've been trying to call and using my knowledge to try to, you know, circuit through you and create A bed of knowledge and a lightning rod for people to try to come to terms with it and think about what breakaway civilization are we going to form?
[01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:45.250]  Well, that's right.
[01:11:45.351 --> 01:11:53.897]  They are a bunch of wicked, selfish, delusional control freaks that believe they've been given the birthright and the deed of the future, and they haven't.
[01:11:54.237 --> 01:12:10.087]   So if we're aware of the fact they're doing this with their great reset, Build Back Better, and we build a coalition against it and get people discussing the future and advanced technology and cloning and gene editing to have a real debate about it, We will then be active players in the decision-making process and not just chattel animals.
[01:12:10.387 --> 01:12:15.569]  But they see us as animals if you cannot address them and figure out what they're doing and oppose them.
[01:12:15.889 --> 01:12:17.970]  The globalists respect me.
[01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:24.272]  They respect you, Jordan, because they know you're aware of this stuff.
[01:12:24.672 --> 01:12:27.573]  If you're not even aware of it, you're not even on the playing field.
[01:12:27.613 --> 01:12:28.213]  You don't even count.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.243]  No, but you've given us all an opportunity, and I appreciate that.
[01:12:33.343 --> 01:12:34.664]  I know you're under a lot of pressure.
[01:12:34.904 --> 01:12:36.125]  I'm doing everything I can.
[01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:53.660]  I will be launching a website to catalog my research, as Owen Schroer says on that May 27, 2021, you know, recording, okay, where I was on the war room with him, and I followed up with you later the next year, I believe, or later that year, excuse me, that September.
[01:12:54.250 --> 01:13:00.253]  Um, where I will be cataloging what their plan is, because the mode of control is very important that we understand.
[01:13:00.333 --> 01:13:14.700]  Yeah, it's cut off the resources, make us go through a digital social credit score carbon tax, which has total behavioral control and lifetime surveillance, hard-coded into all civilization, a whole new system they're building, which is then a post-humanist system.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:17.601]  So, complying with it does not empower you, it destroys you.
[01:13:18.001 --> 01:13:21.862]  Including those that are serving and who believe they're gonna become gods, betraying humanity.
[01:13:21.902 --> 01:13:29.885]  But anybody that knows about how this works knows that the betrayers, the traitors, the first people that the real controllers will get rid of.
[01:13:29.925 --> 01:13:31.005]  Thank you so much, Jordan.
[01:13:31.926 --> 01:13:32.566]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:13:33.546 --> 01:13:35.347]  We're gonna come back with Tyler.
[01:13:36.181 --> 01:13:41.245]  And with Brian, and with Robert, and Eric, and Joe, and DJ, and Josh, and others.
[01:13:41.345 --> 01:13:42.246]  Bam, bam, bam.
[01:13:42.706 --> 01:13:47.550]  Your calls on this live Thursday broadcast that wasn't even supposed to exist.
[01:13:48.171 --> 01:13:50.173]  We were supposed to be off air by now.
[01:13:50.633 --> 01:13:51.774]  They could be carrying all this out.
[01:13:51.814 --> 01:13:52.795]  They're so frustrated.
[01:13:52.835 --> 01:13:53.595]  They're so upset.
[01:13:53.635 --> 01:13:54.396]  They're not God.
[01:13:54.656 --> 01:13:55.437]  They will be defeated.
[01:13:56.463 --> 01:13:57.884]  Because that's what Americans do now.
[01:13:58.044 --> 01:14:04.927]  They're always willing to trade away a little of their freedom in exchange for the feeling, the illusion of security.
[01:14:05.187 --> 01:14:15.892]  What we have now is a completely neurotic population obsessed with security and safety and crime and drugs and cleanliness and hygiene and germs.
[01:14:16.272 --> 01:14:17.152]  There's another thing.
[01:14:17.573 --> 01:14:18.073]  Germs.
[01:14:18.473 --> 01:14:20.794]  Where did this sudden fear of germs come from?
[01:14:21.214 --> 01:14:21.855]  In this country.
[01:14:21.895 --> 01:14:22.655]  Have you noticed this?
[01:14:22.995 --> 01:14:40.601]  The media, constantly running stories about all the latest infections, salmonella, E. coli, hantavirus, bird flu, and the Americans, they panic easily, so now everybody's running around, scrubbing this and spraying that, and overcooking their food, and repeatedly washing their hands, trying to avoid all contact with germs.
[01:14:40.961 --> 01:14:43.923]  It's ridiculous, and it goes to ridiculous lengths.
[01:14:44.403 --> 01:14:45.423]  Fear it, germs!
[01:14:45.503 --> 01:14:47.604]  Why, these fucking p***ies!
[01:14:49.045 --> 01:14:50.667]  Hey, where's your sense of adventure?
[01:14:50.747 --> 01:14:52.269]  Take a fucking chance, will ya?
[01:14:53.370 --> 01:14:56.494]  Besides, what do you think you have an immune system for?
[01:14:57.014 --> 01:14:58.416]  It's for killing germs!
[01:14:58.997 --> 01:15:00.058]  But it needs practice.
[01:15:00.378 --> 01:15:02.260]  It needs germs to practice on.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:05.684]  So, so listen.
[01:15:07.146 --> 01:15:07.647]  So listen.
[01:15:09.818 --> 01:15:16.503]  If you kill all the germs around you and live a completely sterile life, then when germs do come along, you're not going to be prepared.
[01:15:16.743 --> 01:15:24.648]  And never mind ordinary germs, what are you going to do when some super virus comes along that turns your vital organs into liquid sh**?
[01:15:24.668 --> 01:15:28.309]   I'll tell you what you're gonna do, you're gonna get sick, you're gonna die, and you're gonna deserve it,
[01:15:28.309 --> 01:15:31.547]   'cause you're f***ing weak, and you got a f***ing weak immune system.
[01:15:31.547 --> 01:15:38.108]  [laughter and applause]
[01:15:38.108 --> 01:15:41.628]  Let me tell you a true story about immunization, okay?
[01:15:41.686 --> 01:15:49.511]  When I was a little boy in New York City in the 1940s, we swam in the Hudson River, and it was filled with raw sewage, okay?
[01:15:50.052 --> 01:15:51.833]  We swam in raw sewage.
[01:15:52.233 --> 01:15:53.574]  You know, to cool off!
[01:15:55.796 --> 01:15:57.918]  And at that time, the big fear was polio.
[01:15:58.138 --> 01:16:00.299]  Thousands of kids died from polio every year.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:01.100]  But you know something?
[01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.422]  In my neighborhood, no one ever got polio.
[01:16:03.522 --> 01:16:04.022]  No one.
[01:16:04.222 --> 01:16:04.463]  Ever.
[01:16:04.483 --> 01:16:05.263]  You know why?
[01:16:05.283 --> 01:16:07.445]  Because we swam in raw sewage!
[01:16:09.545 --> 01:16:11.106]  It strengthened our immune systems.
[01:16:11.447 --> 01:16:12.988]  The polio never had a prayer.
[01:16:13.028 --> 01:16:14.809]  We were tempered in raw sh**.
[01:16:19.032 --> 01:16:21.854]  You tell them, George Carlin, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:16:22.614 --> 01:16:23.835]  Wow, that was powerful.
[01:16:26.156 --> 01:16:37.244]  We're gonna go back to your calls, and I'll continue with calls the next hour, but I'm gonna hit the other Second Amendment news, and Yuvaldi, because... I don't wanna say I dropped the ball on Yuvaldi, but...
[01:16:38.197 --> 01:16:41.800]  It's just hard to believe that all these things are total lies.
[01:16:42.401 --> 01:16:43.722]  And they admit the whole thing's a lie.
[01:16:43.742 --> 01:16:45.744]  The head of the state police says everything's a lie.
[01:16:45.764 --> 01:16:46.525]  They don't even know what happened.
[01:16:47.125 --> 01:16:49.527]  Don't know what happened!
[01:16:49.547 --> 01:16:52.730]  19 dead children, two dead teachers were told, and everything's a lie.
[01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:55.873]  So it's completely reasonable to say you don't believe any of it.
[01:16:56.474 --> 01:16:57.835]  Oh, but you'll get sued if you say that.
[01:16:57.855 --> 01:16:59.737]  You're not supposed to ask any of those questions, right?
[01:17:00.776 --> 01:17:02.098]  Well, we'll keep asking those questions.
[01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.139]  And I'm going to go to you, Baldy, now.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:04.501]  I'm just going to talk to people.
[01:17:04.941 --> 01:17:05.482]  See what they say.
[01:17:06.063 --> 01:17:07.144]  Got a bunch of folks want to talk to us.
[01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:08.786]  I know that scares the system.
[01:17:09.407 --> 01:17:12.091]  Why don't they want us questioning?
[01:17:12.651 --> 01:17:14.474]  Why don't they want us to have platforms to question?
[01:17:14.814 --> 01:17:16.036]  Why are they so scared of them for us?
[01:17:16.056 --> 01:17:16.837]  We're going back to your calls.
[01:17:16.857 --> 01:17:17.498]  Why don't you just say this?
[01:17:19.005 --> 01:17:38.532]  PrepareWithAlex.com, hyperlinks to preparetoday.com, which is run by our great storable foods distributor, and the great folks over there, and they have all the food in stock, and the water filters, the air filters, and all these other best-selling survival and preparedness items, many of which are the lowest price you're going to find anywhere.
[01:17:38.832 --> 01:17:41.252]  Could you find something on there maybe lower at Amazon?
[01:17:41.272 --> 01:17:41.473]  Yeah.
[01:17:41.493 --> 01:17:42.513]  You want to support the New World Order?
[01:17:42.973 --> 01:17:45.034]  The point is, almost all of it's lowest price you're gonna find.
[01:17:45.074 --> 01:17:45.994]  It's all very competitive.
[01:17:46.354 --> 01:17:48.595]  PrepareToday.com, PrepareToday.com.
[01:17:49.136 --> 01:17:51.036]  It's all there, ready to ship now.
[01:17:51.076 --> 01:17:52.217]  And this is how you beat inflation.
[01:17:52.497 --> 01:17:55.098]  You buy food now, and as the price goes up, you save money.
[01:17:55.138 --> 01:17:56.339]  I told you this 30 months ago.
[01:17:56.659 --> 01:17:59.240]  Those of you who bought food then, boy, were you smart.
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:00.821]  And it's only gonna go up anyway.
[01:18:00.901 --> 01:18:04.442]  So even if you waited or didn't do it, now is the time to stop procrastinating.
[01:18:04.702 --> 01:18:06.503]  PrepareToday.com and be smart.
[01:18:07.563 --> 01:18:08.564]  Separately, we...
[01:18:09.668 --> 01:18:12.891]  Hold back items for people to sign up for auto-ship with the initial 10% off.
[01:18:13.431 --> 01:18:14.873]  And they overheld some stuff.
[01:18:14.953 --> 01:18:17.435]  It's coming back in late July, they think.
[01:18:17.495 --> 01:18:19.357]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, one of our best-selling products.
[01:18:19.637 --> 01:18:21.278]  High-quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids.
[01:18:21.679 --> 01:18:23.841]  So tasty, so great for children, adults, you name it.
[01:18:24.181 --> 01:18:25.802]  Put a scoop of it in water and some ice.
[01:18:26.183 --> 01:18:26.763]  Tastes amazing.
[01:18:27.444 --> 01:18:28.285]  Does so many great things.
[01:18:28.325 --> 01:18:31.628]  Because it's liquid, you absorb a lot more of it than pills, even though they're high-quality.
[01:18:33.151 --> 01:18:39.913]  We found 1,100 bottles of that, that because of a miscalculation with AutoShip we had, it'll sell out probably today.
[01:18:39.933 --> 01:18:46.034]  It's available at InfowarsStore.com as well, or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[01:18:46.494 --> 01:18:50.475]  And despite the fact that it'll sell out today, it's still 25% off.
[01:18:51.416 --> 01:18:55.137]  And I'm going to stop right there now, and I'm going to move back to your phone calls.
[01:18:55.217 --> 01:19:03.305]   Other than saying this, I talked to the National Citizens four weeks ago, five weeks ago, with I think the most important documentary ever, proving that they stole the election.
[01:19:04.645 --> 01:19:08.826]  And I said, I bet I'll buy 100,000 DVDs from you because people want to have it in their archive.
[01:19:08.866 --> 01:19:10.406]  And it's such a historic film.
[01:19:10.987 --> 01:19:12.027]  And we bought 20,000.
[01:19:12.107 --> 01:19:14.047]  I said, I think we'll be reordering it every few weeks.
[01:19:14.728 --> 01:19:15.988]  We've only sold out half of these.
[01:19:16.648 --> 01:19:17.748]  And I'm not mad at the audience.
[01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:20.548]  I just think you're crazy.
[01:19:20.548 --> 01:19:22.548]  With all the censorship online, what's happening?
[01:19:22.548 --> 01:19:27.468]   You need this historic film on your shelf to show friends, family, neighbors, your office,
[01:19:27.468 --> 01:19:30.588]  your boss, your employees, your church, whoever.
[01:19:30.588 --> 01:19:32.229]  And so we have it, we have "Cobeland 3,"
[01:19:32.229 --> 01:19:34.269]  the shot, getting in on how deadly the shot is.
[01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:37.189]   Both those are discounted together, but everybody needs them.
[01:19:37.183 --> 01:19:38.264]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:19:38.324 --> 01:19:41.306]  And I'll be quite frank, I'm surprised more people haven't got it.
[01:19:41.506 --> 01:19:45.949]  I think you're crazy when you're ever on the site getting other products to not get this and it keeps the show on the air.
[01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:49.051]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:19:49.171 --> 01:19:49.812]  Okay.
[01:19:50.292 --> 01:19:55.796]  Who's been holding the longest now?
[01:19:56.397 --> 01:19:59.879]  And that would be a caller in Florida.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:02.401]  That would be Joe in Florida.
[01:20:02.421 --> 01:20:03.041]  Joe, welcome.
[01:20:05.103 --> 01:20:05.403]  Hey, Alex.
[01:20:05.831 --> 01:20:06.171]  Yes, sir.
[01:20:06.471 --> 01:20:06.772]  Go ahead.
[01:20:07.612 --> 01:20:08.473]  Great talking to you.
[01:20:09.033 --> 01:20:14.216]  I love everything you do, and I just don't even want to imagine where we'd be without you.
[01:20:15.077 --> 01:20:36.536]   I wanted to... I'm a horticultural scientist, and I've majored in... I got my degree at University of Florida in horticultural science, and there's this common misconception that I've heard Harrison and Owen say that there's There's a lot of the plants are lacking the nutrients that they used to have.
[01:20:37.276 --> 01:20:48.140]  But the problem with that is that there's 16 essential plant nutrients and the plants use them as they incorporate them into their structures and they use them for enzymatic functions and whatnot.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:50.201]  And so they can't grow without them.
[01:20:50.481 --> 01:20:55.782]  And for example, copper, the plant needs 200 times more nitrogen than it needs copper.
[01:20:56.162 --> 01:21:00.602]   But still, if it lacks the little teeny bit of copper that it needs, it can't grow at
[01:21:00.602 --> 01:21:01.602]  all.
[01:21:01.602 --> 01:21:04.601]   If it's lacking any trace element, it can't grow, just like humans.
[01:21:04.601 --> 01:21:05.601]  Exactly.
[01:21:05.601 --> 01:21:09.482]  And we actually use the same essential nutrients as plants.
[01:21:09.482 --> 01:21:15.242]   Now that's not to say, I mean, I take X2, so it's not to say that you're going to get
[01:21:15.242 --> 01:21:17.282]  as much iodine as you need from plants.
[01:21:17.282 --> 01:21:20.322]  Most plants don't need much iodine.
[01:21:20.322 --> 01:21:23.082]   Seaweed needs a lot of iodine, so seaweed's a great source of it.
[01:21:23.082 --> 01:21:24.482]  But I love your X2 product.
[01:21:24.482 --> 01:21:31.762]   I also take the BODY, the Top Brain, Down and Out, Primal Youth, Vazobeat, the BrainForce,
[01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:34.082]  Ultra, they're all great.
[01:21:34.418 --> 01:21:39.321]  So if the nutrients aren't in the soil, there are some depleted soils from poor farming techniques.
[01:21:39.581 --> 01:21:43.643]  But if they're not in the soil, then they have to be added by fertilizers, otherwise the plants won't grow.
[01:21:43.723 --> 01:21:49.907]  And the studies show so many of the diseases are caused by deficiencies of any of these trace elements.
[01:21:51.228 --> 01:21:51.588]  Correct.
[01:21:52.488 --> 01:21:54.830]  And so that's a great reason to take DX2.
[01:21:56.531 --> 01:22:02.655]  Other thing I wanted to talk about that's really important as the climate lockdowns are seeming more and more inevitable.
[01:22:04.056 --> 01:22:08.298]  There's this nebulous, ambiguous boogeyman of climate change they're using now.
[01:22:09.318 --> 01:22:10.719]  And they don't want to call it global warming.
[01:22:10.739 --> 01:22:12.660]  They know that that's been disproven.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.541]  They used to talk about global cooling.
[01:22:14.782 --> 01:22:23.566]  But right now we're approaching the end of an 11-year solar cycle in which the sun flips its polarity like a magnet as the North and South.
[01:22:26.374 --> 01:22:30.076]  At the end of that 11-year cycle, the sun is as active as it's going to get.
[01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.857]  And there's more sunspots and solar flares.
[01:22:33.177 --> 01:22:34.418]  It's basically getting hotter.
[01:22:34.538 --> 01:22:35.238]  And you can feel it.
[01:22:35.298 --> 01:22:42.902]  It was originally supposed to be around 2025, but now scientists think that we're going to approach that closer to 2024.
[01:22:43.423 --> 01:22:47.125]  But anyhow, you can go outside and feel how bright the sun is on a bright day.
[01:22:47.545 --> 01:22:54.622]   And actually, if there was a greenhouse effect going on that was causing the globe to heat up, The greenhouse effect.
[01:22:54.642 --> 01:22:55.142]  That's right.
[01:22:55.202 --> 01:23:00.384]  And all the real studies show the sun is the driver of climate, not the gases we're putting into the air.
[01:23:00.764 --> 01:23:07.507]  And the gases like methane and carbon dioxide is what the plants need, what the earth needs, what the atmosphere needs to sustain itself.
[01:23:07.567 --> 01:23:09.427]  So the sun is heating up.
[01:23:09.527 --> 01:23:10.448]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:23:11.568 --> 01:23:11.968]  Exactly.
[01:23:11.988 --> 01:23:19.391]  And as a horticulturalist, you know, I used to, for 11 years, I was in the cannabis industry and I was a head grower in New Jersey.
[01:23:19.411 --> 01:23:28.006]   I'm from Florida originally, but there we would use A thousand parts per million of CO2, which is about three times higher than you'd find naturally.
[01:23:28.026 --> 01:23:28.966]  Let's explain that.
[01:23:29.006 --> 01:23:31.608]  You would pump CO2 in to grow more bud.
[01:23:32.428 --> 01:23:32.908]  Exactly.
[01:23:32.968 --> 01:23:36.910]  It would up the level of growth by up to 150 percent.
[01:23:38.651 --> 01:23:40.131]  And so that's a common thing.
[01:23:40.211 --> 01:23:43.913]  And so why would they be trying to block something so fundamental to life?
[01:23:44.673 --> 01:23:45.354]  It's ludicrous.
[01:23:45.714 --> 01:23:48.575]  And, you know, actually, I thought it was really funny.
[01:23:48.655 --> 01:23:52.177]  And there is some truth to what you're saying about the weaponized marijuana.
[01:23:52.197 --> 01:23:52.937]  I thought that was great.
[01:23:55.517 --> 01:24:02.383]  Also, I want to talk about, there's a lot of pseudoscience out there that's really hurting kids' interest in science.
[01:24:02.423 --> 01:24:04.605]  Tell you what, you're a really smart caller, Joe.
[01:24:04.645 --> 01:24:09.249]  I'm going to air a clip of DeSantis for five minutes, but if you'll hold until the next hour, I'll come to you at 6 after.
[01:24:09.269 --> 01:24:10.070]  Will you hold for us?
[01:24:10.770 --> 01:24:11.391]  Sure, that'd be great.
[01:24:11.491 --> 01:24:12.772]  I want to hear this, you're a smart guy.
[01:24:13.112 --> 01:24:14.674]  By the way, it's not his opinion, it's not my opinion.
[01:24:15.697 --> 01:24:19.221]  They've done studies where you triple, quadruple CO2, which is already a trace gas.
[01:24:19.822 --> 01:24:20.723]  Everything's healthier.
[01:24:20.743 --> 01:24:22.325]  More oxygen, the Earth greens.
[01:24:22.845 --> 01:24:24.908]  Why are they attacking what makes the Earth healthy?
[01:24:25.248 --> 01:24:27.130]  This is an evil globalist operation.
[01:24:27.391 --> 01:24:28.852]  They're not just trying to kill human life.
[01:24:29.293 --> 01:24:31.716]  They want to terraform the whole planet for what they are.
[01:24:32.483 --> 01:24:35.046]  It's the most fanned news network in the world.
[01:24:35.187 --> 01:24:38.151]  It's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:48.711]  I'm Dr. Claire Craig.
[01:24:48.799 --> 01:24:51.901]  I'm a diagnostic pathologist and I'm co-chair of the Heart Group.
[01:24:52.461 --> 01:25:00.406]  And I want to take you through the evidence that Pfizer just presented to the FDA on the six-month to four-year-old children.
[01:25:00.686 --> 01:25:05.629]  There's an awful lot about this trial that has shocked me and I think will shock you too.
[01:25:06.030 --> 01:25:07.190]  The trial recruited 4,526 children.
[01:25:10.232 --> 01:25:13.713]  Age from six months to four years old.
[01:25:13.733 --> 01:25:16.853]  3,000 of these children did not make it to the end of the trial.
[01:25:17.293 --> 01:25:19.054]  That is a huge number.
[01:25:19.414 --> 01:25:20.434]  Two-thirds of them.
[01:25:20.674 --> 01:25:22.034]  Why was there this drop-off?
[01:25:22.534 --> 01:25:23.654]  That needs to be answered.
[01:25:23.834 --> 01:25:28.475]  And without an answer to that, on that basis alone, this trial should be deemed null and void.
[01:25:28.855 --> 01:25:30.235]  So what did the trial show?
[01:25:30.536 --> 01:25:38.057]  Well, they defined severe COVID as children who had a slightly raised heart rate or a few more breaths per minute.
[01:25:38.357 --> 01:25:46.401]   There were six Children aged two to four who had severe COVID in the vaccine group, but only one in the placebo group.
[01:25:47.061 --> 01:25:54.745]  So on that basis, the likelihood that this vaccine is actually causing severe COVID is higher than the likelihood that it is.
[01:25:55.285 --> 01:25:58.447]  There was actually one child who was hospitalized in this trial.
[01:25:58.887 --> 01:26:00.568]  They had a fever and a seizure.
[01:26:01.294 --> 01:26:02.535]  They had been vaccinated.
[01:26:03.055 --> 01:26:06.438]  So now let's turn to what they defined as any Covid.
[01:26:06.878 --> 01:26:10.081]  And what they did was to utterly twist the data.
[01:26:10.921 --> 01:26:16.686]  They vaccinated the children and they waited three weeks after the first dose before the second dose.
[01:26:17.256 --> 01:26:32.223]  In that three-week period, 34 of the vaccinated children got COVID and only 13 in the placebo group, which worked out as a 30% increased chance of catching COVID in that three-week period if you were vaccinated.
[01:26:32.243 --> 01:26:33.644]  So they ignored that data.
[01:26:34.736 --> 01:26:41.741]  And then there was an eight week gap between the second dose and the third dose, where again, children were getting plenty of COVID in the vaccine arm.
[01:26:41.761 --> 01:26:43.062]  So they ignored that data.
[01:26:43.763 --> 01:26:53.210]  There was then seven weeks after the third dose, which they also ignored, which meant that in the end, they had ignored 97% of the COVID that occurred during the trial.
[01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:56.973]  And they just looked at tiny numbers, so tiny.
[01:26:57.113 --> 01:27:06.693]   In the end, they were comparing three children in the vaccine arm who had COVID with seven in the placebo arm and they said that this showed the vaccine's effective.
[01:27:07.119 --> 01:27:11.201]  There are more allergic reactions to the COVID vaccines than first expected.
[01:27:11.681 --> 01:27:15.683]  Headaches, nausea, hallucinations, and yes, even death.
[01:27:16.123 --> 01:27:17.744]  I've lost count of the injuries.
[01:27:17.864 --> 01:27:28.349]  Things like urinating clots of blood, paresthesias, gastroparesis, altered mental status, respiratory arrest, cardiac arrest, new onset diabetes.
[01:27:28.969 --> 01:27:31.170]  I have patients who can't walk anymore.
[01:27:32.090 --> 01:27:35.132]  I've just never seen anything like this in all my years of practicing medicine.
[01:27:36.926 --> 01:27:48.395]  These people are creating a whole conspiracy theory and they are trying to basically to benefit and profit from this fear of the people.
[01:27:48.715 --> 01:27:49.976]  And this is who are the criminals.
[01:27:49.996 --> 01:27:52.678]  Those that they don't get the vaccine.
[01:27:52.939 --> 01:27:57.422]  The people that are circulating all this misinformation, they are criminals.
[01:27:58.243 --> 01:28:09.774]   Get your DVD copy of COVID Land 3 The Shot at Infowarsstore.com Oh, no, no, no.
[01:28:09.794 --> 01:28:10.694]  I don't even know what this is.
[01:28:10.754 --> 01:28:11.395]  How did you get here?
[01:28:12.775 --> 01:28:14.855]  I just caught you, American!
[01:28:15.155 --> 01:28:17.236]  You visited Bandar Video.
[01:28:18.136 --> 01:28:21.377]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at you.
[01:28:21.737 --> 01:28:27.737]   Do what CNN says and do not visit me in my video or I have to hurt you.
[01:28:27.737 --> 01:28:46.158]   I'm I want to air it.
[01:28:46.538 --> 01:28:50.221]  We'll come right back with your calls and a bunch of breaking news on the other side, but here it is.
[01:28:50.942 --> 01:28:51.782]  Okay, questions.
[01:28:51.903 --> 01:28:52.203]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:56.040]  So the White House is lying about it.
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:28:57.001]  We are surprised.
[01:28:57.021 --> 01:28:58.701]  Not surprised the White House would lie.
[01:28:58.521 --> 01:29:03.421]   What do you make of the White House saying that the state reversed on child vaccines?
[01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:05.721]  So the White House is lying about it.
[01:29:05.721 --> 01:29:07.860]  We are surprised.
[01:29:07.860 --> 01:29:09.481]  Not surprised the White House would lie.
[01:29:09.481 --> 01:29:13.902]   Definitely not surprised that legacy media would amplify the lie because that's what
[01:29:13.902 --> 01:29:14.961]  they do.
[01:29:14.961 --> 01:29:18.400]   The state of Florida, they came out with an article saying the state of Florida has not
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:23.201]   ordered its Department of Health has not ordered mRNA jabs for the babies.
[01:29:23.238 --> 01:29:24.019]  Yes, we didn't.
[01:29:24.439 --> 01:29:25.720]  We recommend against it.
[01:29:26.061 --> 01:29:32.547]  We are not going to have any programs where we're trying to jab six-month-old babies with mRNA.
[01:29:32.867 --> 01:29:33.808]  That's just the reality.
[01:29:38.539 --> 01:29:43.765]  And I think what happened was they thought somehow we would be embarrassed by that.
[01:29:43.825 --> 01:29:45.286]  No, we're following the data.
[01:29:45.326 --> 01:29:46.948]  You look at these European countries.
[01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:53.094]  A lot of them don't even allow Moderna for under age 30, or they recommend against it.
[01:29:53.395 --> 01:29:54.436]  So that was always that.
[01:29:54.516 --> 01:29:55.637]  We still have not ordered it.
[01:29:55.657 --> 01:29:56.518]  We're not going to order it.
[01:29:56.838 --> 01:30:02.021]  Now, what they're saying is because practitioners and hospitals can order it, somehow we reverse.
[01:30:02.241 --> 01:30:04.723]  I said from the beginning they'll be able to do that.
[01:30:04.963 --> 01:30:14.049]  We don't have the authority to prevent it, and quite frankly, if someone wants to make a different decision, I would just caution people, look at the actual data in the clinical trial.
[01:30:14.329 --> 01:30:19.192]  It is the weakest possible data that you could possibly see.
[01:30:19.612 --> 01:30:21.153]  Very small number of people.
[01:30:21.393 --> 01:30:25.712]   what the recommendation is from them, doesn't even track the outcomes.
[01:30:25.712 --> 01:30:29.672]   It was something that, but people can ask their pediatricians, they can ask their
[01:30:29.672 --> 01:30:33.832]   doctors, what's the evidence of protection against severe disease?
[01:30:33.832 --> 01:30:35.472]   There was none in the clinical trial.
[01:30:35.472 --> 01:30:41.752]   But that's something that people do. But for us, Joe Latipo, our Department of Health has looked at it.
[01:30:41.905 --> 01:30:47.810]  There is no proven benefit to put a baby with an mRNA.
[01:30:47.890 --> 01:30:49.991]  So that's why our recommendation is against it.
[01:30:50.212 --> 01:30:54.715]  That's different than prohibiting the use in Florida, which we don't have the authority to do.
[01:30:54.915 --> 01:30:59.099]  And quite frankly, you know, we're confident people can make their own judgments on it.
[01:30:59.119 --> 01:31:06.802]   But I would say when you look at the trial, one of the things they did, they did not have babies or very young kids who had recovered from COVID in
[01:31:06.802 --> 01:31:07.382]  the trial.
[01:31:07.382 --> 01:31:10.582]   So we don't know what this will do for people that have recovered.
[01:31:10.582 --> 01:31:18.981]   But in their recommendation, they are recommending giving the mRNA shot to people, young babies and kids that
[01:31:18.981 --> 01:31:20.582]  have already recovered from COVID.
[01:31:20.582 --> 01:31:23.302]  They don't have any clinical data on that.
[01:31:23.302 --> 01:31:26.902]   And people have looked at some of this stuff and have recognized how that...
[01:31:26.902 --> 01:31:30.902]   And you know what? The White House is bragging that we're the only country
[01:31:30.902 --> 01:31:34.902]  that is trying to do mRNA shots for infants.
[01:31:34.912 --> 01:31:36.555]  And I'm just thinking to myself, well wait a minute.
[01:31:36.815 --> 01:31:40.400]  There's nothing wrong with being the Lone Ranger, if you're right.
[01:31:40.921 --> 01:31:46.048]  But the other countries in Europe that are going a different direction, similar to the direction Florida's gone.
[01:31:46.508 --> 01:31:52.670]  They have been right on COVID way more than Fauci and his crew have been throughout this whole thing.
[01:31:52.970 --> 01:31:58.592]  Remember, these are people in Washington that rejected the idea of natural immunity.
[01:31:59.131 --> 01:32:04.211]   For a year and a half, they said that the vaccine was better than prior infection.
[01:32:04.211 --> 01:32:08.692]   And every credible study that's been done has said that that's not the case.
[01:32:08.692 --> 01:32:10.970]  And so they've been wrong time and time again.
[01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:13.970]   They were wrong when they criticized me for having schools open.
[01:32:13.970 --> 01:32:17.330]   They wanted our kids locked out of school in the state of Florida.
[01:32:17.330 --> 01:32:21.051]   They were wrong when they criticized me for having businesses open, beaches,
[01:32:21.051 --> 01:32:22.451]  all these other things.
[01:32:22.451 --> 01:32:27.771]   And so this is an example where they are pushing this with very,
[01:32:27.771 --> 01:32:29.970]  very scant data.
[01:32:29.970 --> 01:32:33.731]   But again, people can make their judgments, but ask questions.
[01:32:33.731 --> 01:32:36.692]   And the fact of the matter is, I think what this whole year and
[01:32:36.692 --> 01:32:41.771]   a half has shown us is, these regulatory agencies in the federal government
[01:32:41.771 --> 01:32:46.971]   have basically become subsidiaries of the pharmaceutical companies.
[01:32:46.971 --> 01:32:51.974]   They are not independent regulators, they basically are there to rubber
[01:32:51.974 --> 01:32:53.893]  stamp what Pfizer wants to do.
[01:32:53.893 --> 01:33:00.132]   So people can make their judgments on it, but we have not ordered any for the Department of Health.
[01:33:00.132 --> 01:33:03.893]  There's been absolutely zero change in our recommendations.
[01:33:03.893 --> 01:33:09.814]   And the recommendations, remember, we were the first state to recommend against 6-11 year olds.
[01:33:09.865 --> 01:33:12.007]  We never had any state programs for any of that.
[01:33:12.248 --> 01:33:15.671]  There have been some practitioners that have ordered it, and some have gotten it.
[01:33:15.731 --> 01:33:20.436]  Most parents are not giving it for the kids with the MNRA, but some did.
[01:33:20.697 --> 01:33:21.738]  And I think it's the same thing.
[01:33:21.758 --> 01:33:26.723]  So this is a continuation of our policy that we've had in place really since the spring.
[01:33:27.363 --> 01:33:33.530]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:33.730 --> 01:33:36.193]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.773 --> 01:33:43.700]  The Trooper by Iron Maiden says it all.
[01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:45.362]  Let's listen to a minute or so of this song.
[01:33:45.382 --> 01:33:47.164]  I'm gonna go right back to your calls.
[01:33:47.224 --> 01:33:48.545]  Joe and others from Florida.
[01:33:48.706 --> 01:33:50.065]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:50.065 --> 01:33:53.025]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:33:53.025 --> 01:34:02.145]  We'll tie your musket, but I'll run you through.
[01:34:02.890 --> 01:34:05.893]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too.
[01:34:05.933 --> 01:34:08.755]  You'll fire a musket, but I'll run you through.
[01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:11.198]  So when you're waiting for the next attack.
[01:34:11.358 --> 01:34:13.400]  You better stand, there's no turning back.
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:17.284]  The viewer's eyes will tell us for games.
[01:34:17.324 --> 01:34:20.346]  But on this battlefield, no one wins.
[01:34:20.366 --> 01:34:22.989]  The smell of musk and smoking horses breath.
[01:34:27.819 --> 01:34:30.041]  As we charge into certain death.
[01:34:30.801 --> 01:34:37.286]  With our ancestors breathing power and lightning into us.
[01:34:40.648 --> 01:34:42.529]  You better stand, there's no turning back.
[01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:46.472]  The bugle sounds, the charge begins.
[01:34:48.536 --> 01:34:49.938]  They've charged us.
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:51.861]  They are depleting us.
[01:34:51.901 --> 01:34:52.903]  They are bankrupting us.
[01:34:52.943 --> 01:34:54.245]  They are poisoning us.
[01:34:54.285 --> 01:34:55.166]  They are killing us.
[01:34:55.507 --> 01:34:59.232]  But we, as our ancestors did, will awaken.
[01:34:59.272 --> 01:34:59.873]  Crank it back up!
[01:35:01.154 --> 01:35:03.715]  We will take the challenge.
[01:35:03.715 --> 01:35:07.715]  We bring to us the manual of the machine guns.
[01:35:07.715 --> 01:35:13.715]   In every race toward the human war, the strength of man is the courage to fall.
[01:35:13.715 --> 01:35:16.715]  We hurt more bodies than we hurt the ground.
[01:35:16.715 --> 01:35:19.713]  And the punches found never end.
[01:35:19.713 --> 01:35:25.715]   We get to near you so far away, we won't live to fight another day.
[01:35:25.715 --> 01:35:34.715]  [Music]
[01:35:34.715 --> 01:35:37.715]  Be like your ancestors.
[01:35:38.133 --> 01:35:40.796]  Be strong.
[01:35:40.816 --> 01:35:41.617]  Face eternity.
[01:35:42.438 --> 01:35:46.421]  Join God and join us in the future.
[01:35:47.422 --> 01:35:51.747]  We are waiting for you in the time-space bridge.
[01:35:52.627 --> 01:35:54.990]  We are here together forever.
[01:35:55.489 --> 01:36:00.489]  Choose the spirit which you follow now, and choose wisely.
[01:36:00.489 --> 01:36:02.489]  I am waiting.
[01:36:02.489 --> 01:36:05.489]  You are waiting.
[01:36:05.489 --> 01:36:09.489]  We are together now. Forever.
[01:36:09.489 --> 01:36:13.489]  Nothing can change that, except your free will.
[01:36:13.489 --> 01:36:16.489]  Make the decision now.
[01:36:16.489 --> 01:36:18.489]  Join us.
[01:36:18.489 --> 01:36:20.489]  Join life.
[01:36:20.489 --> 01:36:21.489]  Join honor.
[01:36:21.489 --> 01:36:23.489]  Join the Great Mission.
[01:36:23.489 --> 01:36:25.489]  The Great Commission.
[01:36:25.489 --> 01:36:33.489]  Best part of the song right here.
[01:36:33.489 --> 01:36:50.489]  We've got some cool spirit, not some fakes.
[01:36:51.489 --> 01:37:14.489]  [Music]
[01:37:15.128 --> 01:37:18.493]  If you did not die in dishonor, you died in victory.
[01:37:19.254 --> 01:37:23.499]  And you will never live spiritually among those that bow to evil.
[01:37:24.401 --> 01:37:25.482]  God hates cowards.
[01:37:26.223 --> 01:37:31.590]  And God loves children, drunks, and the United States of America.
[01:37:34.773 --> 01:37:37.455]  We have the victory in our hands.
[01:37:37.475 --> 01:37:37.815]  All right.
[01:37:38.195 --> 01:37:40.196]  I had a caller hold over Joe in Florida.
[01:37:40.637 --> 01:37:43.778]  He's a horticologist, person that grows plants.
[01:37:44.659 --> 01:37:47.721]  He told you he's run big marijuana labs, illegal ones, everything.
[01:37:48.161 --> 01:37:49.942]  Tripled the carbon dioxide, 150% yield.
[01:37:50.082 --> 01:37:51.383]  He's done all the studies.
[01:37:51.723 --> 01:37:52.444]  Don't need to believe him.
[01:37:52.464 --> 01:37:53.244]  Just look it up yourself.
[01:37:54.005 --> 01:37:56.766]  Deserts disappear with only 20-30% increase.
[01:37:57.207 --> 01:37:58.667]  The world's greening right now.
[01:37:58.747 --> 01:37:59.628]  The sun is good.
[01:38:00.028 --> 01:38:00.689]  It's all good.
[01:38:00.729 --> 01:38:01.489]  God gave it to us.
[01:38:01.369 --> 01:38:09.968]   why is everything that's life-giving under attack by these criminals?
[01:38:09.968 --> 01:38:11.968]  Joe in Florida, tell us more.
[01:38:11.968 --> 01:38:19.248]  Well, you know, we hear Fauci saying, "I am the science."
[01:38:19.302 --> 01:38:23.525]  The thing with science now is there's really bad stuff going on.
[01:38:23.745 --> 01:38:26.107]  One example is in cosmology.
[01:38:26.187 --> 01:38:37.059]   There's this pseudoscience that started with Einstein with black holes and just Really nonsensical notions of black holes, dark matter, and things that include infinities.
[01:38:37.879 --> 01:38:40.621]  And they supposedly came up with these things with equations.
[01:38:40.901 --> 01:38:45.363]  Well, we know if you're doing an equation, you can't have an infinity in the equation.
[01:38:46.063 --> 01:38:55.427]  And really, this stuff's based on, they say it's based on mathematics, but as soon as you're using an infinity, that's a non-tangible idea that you can't do math with.
[01:38:55.447 --> 01:38:57.728]  You can say whatever you want mathematically with an infinity.
[01:38:58.788 --> 01:38:59.028]  Right.
[01:38:59.369 --> 01:38:59.529]  Right.
[01:39:01.314 --> 01:39:10.136]  They basically saw that galaxies' outer arms were rotating way quicker than they would have expected, looking at the mass that they could see in the galaxy.
[01:39:10.156 --> 01:39:14.358]  And so they said, well, there must be this invisible thing in the middle of it for our equations to work.
[01:39:14.658 --> 01:39:20.559]  So we have this conveniently invisible, undetectable, infinitely dense black hole in the middle.
[01:39:21.119 --> 01:39:23.620]  And the same thing with dark matter.
[01:39:23.680 --> 01:39:30.722]  They had a bad equation, and instead of saying, well, maybe our theory's wrong, they said, let's fix the equation with this undetectable dark matter.
[01:39:31.198 --> 01:39:49.746]  And so, if your listeners tune into Thunderbolt's project on YouTube, they are into Electric Universe Theory, which Hannes Alfven won the Nobel Prize for, and they have great theories on how all this stuff really works in cosmology.
[01:39:49.766 --> 01:39:54.248]  Well, give me your view on an alternate view, which science is all about alternate views and questioning.
[01:39:54.888 --> 01:39:59.450]  What is your competing view of the Unified Field Theory?
[01:40:00.799 --> 01:40:07.742]  Well, there are these massive electric currents in outer space called Birkeland's currents, that Christian Birkeland was able to model in the lab.
[01:40:07.842 --> 01:40:13.305]  And all the stuff from Thunderbolt's project is observable, or it's demonstrable.
[01:40:13.445 --> 01:40:17.667]  And by the way, we know the galaxies and all the matter is electromagnetically connected.
[01:40:17.707 --> 01:40:18.127]  You're right.
[01:40:18.147 --> 01:40:20.468]  So there's storms going on, is what you're saying.
[01:40:21.519 --> 01:40:32.508]  Well, so mainstream science will acknowledge that there's these magnetic fields around planets and the sun and everything, but they don't want to tell you that there's electric current coming into the poles of the planets and the sun.
[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:39.823]  They're powering, the sun is being powered by electric currents coming into it, which is why the outer corona of the sun is the hottest part.
[01:40:40.123 --> 01:40:45.966]  It's not being powered by nuclear reactions inside of it where it's actually cooler, and we can see that, we can observe it.
[01:40:46.506 --> 01:40:48.987]  It's cooler when you look down into the sunspots, which are like holes.
[01:40:49.087 --> 01:40:51.408]  Sure, it's an engine being given outside power.
[01:40:52.289 --> 01:41:03.180]   Exactly, and that's why all the galaxies rotate at the same speed regardless of their size, because they're being powered by these massive Light years long, hundreds of light years long, Birkeland's currents traveling.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.641]  And the argument is though, where does the Birkeland current come from?
[01:41:07.041 --> 01:41:22.605]  Well, it's kind of a chicken and an egg thing almost, because you got everything powering... But that goes towards the dark matter theory, with which I understand they're, you think, giving a false hypothesis for why it exists, but there is outside energy being fed into this dimension.
[01:41:23.866 --> 01:41:35.327]   Well, if you look at The radio telescope's modeling of how the universe looks, there's this big web of purple Birkeland's currents, but they don't want to say that those are Birkeland's currents.
[01:41:36.188 --> 01:41:42.033]  They're averse to that idea, but it's a very predictive theory.
[01:41:42.113 --> 01:41:53.543]  For instance, asteroids have been now shown to be made of, or comets have been shown to be made of the same material as asteroids, whereas they said, well, comets are these icy things that start melting when they get near the sun, and that's where the tail comes from.
[01:41:54.181 --> 01:42:01.006]  But Electric Universe Theory would have said, no, as soon as you start coming into the sun's magnetic field, there's this electrical interaction that takes place.
[01:42:01.026 --> 01:42:03.047]  Sure, just like lightning in the atmosphere.
[01:42:03.807 --> 01:42:09.831]  And yes, and tornadoes are an example of a slow discharge of electricity as opposed to a sudden one like lightning.
[01:42:10.312 --> 01:42:14.374]  Sure, but the question goes back to where does this outside power source come from?
[01:42:16.656 --> 01:42:28.855]   Well, it seems to be being exchanged amongst All the galaxies and stars, and all the stars are found in the Z-pinch, what they call these Birkeland currents, where the currents twist together.
[01:42:28.995 --> 01:42:41.842]  And then that also gives you a good theory as to how planets are formed, because if all of a sudden a star gets too much energy going into it, it'll spit out a planetary body, which is like a molten glob, which is how it turns out to be completely spherical.
[01:42:42.475 --> 01:42:47.858]  Whereas gravitational accretion theory says that a bunch of junk starts to accumulate on top of itself.
[01:42:47.878 --> 01:42:50.680]  It polishes perfectly into that, which is pure BS.
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:54.202]  Right, it doesn't make nearly as much sense.
[01:42:55.123 --> 01:43:00.906]  Whereas vaporized matter shot out into zero gravity will form a sphere.
[01:43:02.387 --> 01:43:03.568]  Right.
[01:43:03.588 --> 01:43:17.616]   And plasma experiments in the laboratory now have shown, there's a project called SAFIRE, S-A-F-I-R-E, That has shown that they can use extremely high electrical current.
[01:43:17.677 --> 01:43:18.317]  Hold on, Joe.
[01:43:18.397 --> 01:43:21.980]  I want to hear more of this and other callers coming up, but this is too important.
[01:43:23.081 --> 01:43:32.990]  They fear this broadcast because we are discovering the secrets of the universe together through this time-space continuum with God's Spirit flowing through us.
[01:43:35.387 --> 01:43:39.291]  Jerusalem Post, five planets aligned perfectly, visible until the end of June.
[01:43:39.832 --> 01:43:46.559]  Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn have lined up in a rare alignment that won't occur until 2040, according to AccuWeather.
[01:43:48.441 --> 01:43:56.190]  We're on a planet in space, part of a galaxy orbiting a sun, and here we are talking about the secrets of the universe.
[01:43:57.594 --> 01:44:00.636]  Joe in Florida, finishing up your really interesting points.
[01:44:01.116 --> 01:44:11.041]  What you're getting at here is the official cosmology we're given is not accurate by any stretch of the imagination, and obviously the people studying things in the establishment know that.
[01:44:11.401 --> 01:44:13.402]  Why are they giving us a false cosmology?
[01:44:15.524 --> 01:44:23.228]  Yes, in my view they are, and there's a lot of evidence of that on the Thunderbolts Project that your listeners and viewers could really appreciate.
[01:44:24.591 --> 01:44:26.411]  You know, it's not above people's heads.
[01:44:26.491 --> 01:44:31.293]  Like a lot of this stuff is supposedly, you know, it's so complicated that you just can't understand it.
[01:44:31.313 --> 01:44:32.133]  You know, you're not smart.
[01:44:32.173 --> 01:44:33.153]  That's what they want to tell you.
[01:44:33.173 --> 01:44:36.874]  And then they do this equation on the blackboard that nobody can understand.
[01:44:38.014 --> 01:44:44.576]  It's an electrical energy connected grid of suns and planets and more.
[01:44:46.076 --> 01:44:46.356]  Right.
[01:44:46.956 --> 01:44:53.478]  And the SAFIRE project I was mentioning, they've proven now transmutation of elements.
[01:44:53.904 --> 01:45:04.904]   occurs in this lab, in this vacuum chamber that has an immense electrical discharge going into an anode or a cathode.
[01:45:04.904 --> 01:45:08.904]   Well, they did that 50 years ago with enough power to power a city for a day.
[01:45:08.904 --> 01:45:11.904]   They're able to actually change elements. They have machines that do that.
[01:45:11.904 --> 01:45:16.904]   Yes, and so they've shown that they, and this has been independently verified,
[01:45:16.904 --> 01:45:21.904]   that there's elements after the experiment in the chamber that weren't there before.
[01:45:21.481 --> 01:45:23.321]  Well that's how they've created new elements.
[01:45:23.341 --> 01:45:27.403]  You can type it in, you know, Los Alamos creates new element.
[01:45:27.443 --> 01:45:27.983]  Type that in.
[01:45:28.983 --> 01:45:30.704]  Los Alamos, that's just one laboratory doing this.
[01:45:31.124 --> 01:45:32.665]  Or Japanese create new element.
[01:45:34.025 --> 01:45:40.207]  Right, so the periodic table, the end of it, has a lot of elements that are transitory, that they're able to create and they disappear.
[01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:49.426]   But these elements I'm talking about are like Like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, stuff like that, that they're able to, you know, that's stable afterwards.
[01:45:49.646 --> 01:45:55.668]  And they've created them like, as if, you know, the alchemists were trying to do.
[01:45:55.688 --> 01:46:00.489]  Real quick, I want to plug my brother's book, COVID-42.
[01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:08.292]  It's a dystopian, futuristic novel called COVID-42 by Matt Bender.
[01:46:08.692 --> 01:46:09.572]  I'll look into it, brother.
[01:46:09.712 --> 01:46:10.973]  Thanks for all the great points you made.
[01:46:11.033 --> 01:46:11.853]  Very thought-provoking.
[01:46:13.919 --> 01:46:20.723]  We don't normally keep a caller on for 30 minutes, but he had a lot to say, and I think everybody thought it was informative and enlightening and enjoyable.
[01:46:20.803 --> 01:46:21.464]  So we kept him on.
[01:46:21.504 --> 01:46:23.045]  Let's get to everybody else before this hour ends.
[01:46:23.085 --> 01:46:23.865]  I'll get to all of you.
[01:46:24.746 --> 01:46:25.647]  Who's up next here?
[01:46:25.667 --> 01:46:31.570]  Hmm, that would be, down in the second, who's been holding the longest.
[01:46:32.971 --> 01:46:35.833]  That would be Josh in Arizona.
[01:46:35.893 --> 01:46:36.754]  Josh, you're on the air.
[01:46:36.794 --> 01:46:37.194]  Go ahead.
[01:46:39.195 --> 01:46:40.036]  Hey, Alex.
[01:46:40.476 --> 01:46:40.756]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:40.776 --> 01:46:41.617]  Thank you so much.
[01:46:42.369 --> 01:46:47.130]  First of all, God bless you, and God bless every soldier in the InfoWar.
[01:46:47.470 --> 01:46:49.010]  Thank you so much for having me on today.
[01:46:49.050 --> 01:46:49.970]  I received that.
[01:46:50.111 --> 01:46:51.131]  I received that, brother.
[01:46:51.151 --> 01:46:51.531]  Thank you.
[01:46:52.631 --> 01:46:53.031]  Oh, yes.
[01:46:53.191 --> 01:46:55.812]  Well, hey, I'd like to plug really quick.
[01:46:55.832 --> 01:46:59.992]  Just the other day, I bought a few copies of 2,000 mules from InfoWar store.
[01:47:00.633 --> 01:47:06.814]  I'm planning on giving those out to some of my friends, and I have about a two-year supply of X2.
[01:47:07.654 --> 01:47:08.074]  I love it.
[01:47:08.590 --> 01:47:10.211]  So thank you so much for the great product.
[01:47:10.231 --> 01:47:11.831]  Beautiful brother, because we've been treading water here.
[01:47:11.871 --> 01:47:13.032]  Without you, we'd be off the air.
[01:47:13.052 --> 01:47:14.332]  So everything we do is you.
[01:47:14.352 --> 01:47:16.073]  I don't want to just tell us there's that.
[01:47:16.173 --> 01:47:16.653]  I mean that.
[01:47:16.693 --> 01:47:17.114]  It's true.
[01:47:18.214 --> 01:47:19.434]  You are everything.
[01:47:19.475 --> 01:47:19.875]  Thank you.
[01:47:20.855 --> 01:47:21.075]  Yeah.
[01:47:21.475 --> 01:47:21.615]  Yeah.
[01:47:21.635 --> 01:47:23.336]  Thanks for the great product.
[01:47:23.696 --> 01:47:28.538]  Well, hey, so the topic today was what about the New World Order?
[01:47:28.558 --> 01:47:30.039]  What are we doing about it?
[01:47:30.739 --> 01:47:41.783]   And I want to highlight one really important member of the opposition in particular and I'm really
[01:47:41.783 --> 01:47:47.662]   surprised that you haven't you know had this person on your show or something because
[01:47:47.662 --> 01:47:51.962]   all of Many of your most notable guests over the past several
[01:47:51.962 --> 01:47:57.782]   years are Either hold advisory positions on the board of her
[01:47:57.782 --> 01:48:06.082]   Of her foundation. It's a 501 c3 Faith based charity. Sure. Who is it? Who is it?
[01:48:06.983 --> 01:48:08.983]  Dr. Elizabeth Lee Vliet.
[01:48:09.742 --> 01:48:12.864]  She wrote the intro to Dr. Breggin's book.
[01:48:13.825 --> 01:48:18.790]  She works very closely with Dr. Peter Chambers.
[01:48:19.271 --> 01:48:22.053]  Give me her name again and we will ask her to come on the show.
[01:48:22.514 --> 01:48:23.795]  I love taking calls.
[01:48:24.756 --> 01:48:27.258]  Dr. Elizabeth Lee-Voliet.
[01:48:29.838 --> 01:48:34.420]  And her organization is Truth for Health Foundation, truthforhealth.org.
[01:48:34.840 --> 01:48:41.322]  And Dr. McCullough, when he was on your program, you know, provided that resource to your listeners.
[01:48:41.722 --> 01:48:46.264]  And I'd like to just point out that there are amazing resources there.
[01:48:46.404 --> 01:48:55.524]  She runs a fund.
[01:48:55.580 --> 01:49:04.564]  It's a medical freedom fund for members of the military that are facing court-martial for refusing the vaccination.
[01:49:05.424 --> 01:49:08.646]  And those grants go towards their legal defense.
[01:49:08.766 --> 01:49:11.387]  I know there's a lot of great people behind all these movements.
[01:49:11.447 --> 01:49:15.309]  What's not aware of her, probably read her name before, but we will definitely try to get her on.
[01:49:16.468 --> 01:49:17.389]  Thank you so much, yeah.
[01:49:17.629 --> 01:49:32.420]  And also, she formed a strategic partnership with one of your past guests, VaxAction, and they're doing a very detailed statistical analysis of the vaccine injuries and also providing resources for the vaccine injured.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:38.865]  What do you make of this British Medical Journal official editor report saying the vaccines don't help you, they hurt you?
[01:49:38.905 --> 01:49:39.786]  That's pretty big, right?
[01:49:41.235 --> 01:49:46.718]  Well, I think it's exactly as you say, that it's the rats leaving the sinking ship.
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:59.866]  And with those types of official sources countering their previous narrative, it's going to create a lot of confusion.
[01:50:00.527 --> 01:50:02.368]  And they're going to roll that out slowly.
[01:50:03.012 --> 01:50:07.796]  So that in hopes that everyone sort of forget where the information came from.
[01:50:07.816 --> 01:50:11.358]  That's what they're trying to do is set the precedent to kill us with mandated poisons.
[01:50:11.739 --> 01:50:20.846]  But imagine the cojones, the huevos, to know this is all coming out and now try to make six month olds take it.
[01:50:20.966 --> 01:50:22.927]  I mean, that is so evil.
[01:50:22.967 --> 01:50:24.929]  That is abortion after birth.
[01:50:24.949 --> 01:50:25.469]  God bless you.
[01:50:25.509 --> 01:50:26.230]  I appreciate your call.
[01:50:26.770 --> 01:50:27.391]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:50:28.427 --> 01:50:29.608]  We're going to go right to your calls.
[01:50:29.648 --> 01:50:30.449]  The order received.
[01:50:30.489 --> 01:50:32.311]  We are going to be taking all of them here.
[01:50:32.872 --> 01:50:35.354]  We're going to be talking to Robert next.
[01:50:35.995 --> 01:50:41.100]  We're going to be talking to Brian and Tyler and everybody else on the other side.
[01:50:41.180 --> 01:50:41.661]  Get ready.
[01:50:42.522 --> 01:50:44.624]  We got Brian saying his wife's a nurse.
[01:50:44.744 --> 01:50:45.265]  Fired for...
[01:50:46.684 --> 01:50:49.485]  COVID test denial, which is all a fraud to begin with.
[01:50:49.505 --> 01:51:10.869]  Yeah, it's all a neurotic, hysteria, fear, and now they're getting the new emergency ready with the monkeypox and the UN says they're preparing to declare a new global emergency and everybody follows the UN order to put the masks back on and start the checkpoints and the testing and all the hysteria again, while it's the shots that are causing the lion's share of the illnesses, all the studies and research in the British Medical Journal.
[01:51:11.309 --> 01:51:12.169]  Wow.
[01:51:12.209 --> 01:51:13.210]  Talk about vindication.
[01:51:13.570 --> 01:51:14.470]  You've been vindicated.
[01:51:14.770 --> 01:51:15.830]  Our guests have been vindicated.
[01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:16.731]  I've been vindicated.
[01:51:17.111 --> 01:51:19.031]  Infowars has been vindicated yet again.
[01:51:19.331 --> 01:51:20.292]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:51:20.312 --> 01:51:20.872]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:20.892 --> 01:51:21.292]  Stay with us.
[01:51:21.792 --> 01:51:29.394]  Well, wait till I cover this news next segment about the next leg of the surveillance state and how it ties into animal-human cloning and gene editing.
[01:51:29.614 --> 01:51:30.295]  That's coming up.
[01:51:30.435 --> 01:51:31.395]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:51:33.490 --> 01:51:35.451]  Right now, let's go right back to your phone calls.
[01:51:36.251 --> 01:51:37.732]  Let's talk to Brian in Missouri.
[01:51:37.752 --> 01:51:41.414]  His wife's a nurse, fired for COVID testing denial.
[01:51:42.154 --> 01:51:42.474]  Wow.
[01:51:42.674 --> 01:51:43.875]  Tell us what's happening, Brian.
[01:51:45.375 --> 01:51:45.976]  Hey, Alex.
[01:51:47.016 --> 01:51:47.937]  Appreciate you.
[01:51:47.957 --> 01:51:49.297]  Appreciate your product.
[01:51:50.578 --> 01:51:59.082]  We're one of those families that purchased food 30 months ago from preparewithalex.com, and we couldn't be happier with the results.
[01:52:00.902 --> 01:52:10.959]   I'm calling in because Last year in the fall, my wife received a medical exemption working at a hospital in the St.
[01:52:10.999 --> 01:52:22.847]  Louis area and she was given the medical exemption and then the hospital got rid of everybody in the hospital that did not receive a medical or religious exemption.
[01:52:23.447 --> 01:52:38.579]   Then they turned to the people who had an exemption and they started requiring only Those who had an exemption to have to test on a weekly basis in order to keep their employment.
[01:52:38.879 --> 01:52:42.701]  Even though statistically it's those who have taken the shot that get infected three times more often?
[01:52:43.801 --> 01:52:44.181]  Correct.
[01:52:44.701 --> 01:52:54.266]  At the same time, they decided to stop the program where employees would every day report their own symptoms into the system.
[01:52:54.666 --> 01:52:59.729]  They got rid of that for all employees at the same time that they required that for my wife.
[01:52:59.969 --> 01:53:05.197]   And then Uh, they wanted to, uh, force.
[01:53:05.497 --> 01:53:06.317]  It was a whole hospital.
[01:53:06.377 --> 01:53:08.158]  My wife had no patient interaction.
[01:53:08.678 --> 01:53:09.978]  She worked in a back office.
[01:53:10.819 --> 01:53:24.104]  And, uh, we said, no, we said, you know, an employer should not be able to require anything to go into the bodies of an employee, whether it's medical testing, whether it's a vaccination, whatever.
[01:53:24.164 --> 01:53:25.104]  So we stood our ground.
[01:53:25.805 --> 01:53:29.106]  Uh, she was put on a 30 day unpaid leave.
[01:53:29.918 --> 01:53:30.919]  We tried everything.
[01:53:30.939 --> 01:53:33.381]  We tried opening cases with HR.
[01:53:33.641 --> 01:53:35.442]  They refused to give us a case number.
[01:53:36.043 --> 01:53:42.528]  We argued that it was discrimination under the EEOC for genetic information.
[01:53:43.028 --> 01:53:43.769]  They wouldn't listen.
[01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:47.792]  They already knew my wife was pregnant at the time.
[01:53:48.333 --> 01:53:49.854]  They still fired her.
[01:53:50.134 --> 01:53:52.556]  So, we got together with Wren's Law.
[01:53:52.616 --> 01:53:57.159]  We're going to pursue this case because it has bigger impacts.
[01:53:57.179 --> 01:53:59.021]  It's just our household and our family.
[01:53:59.434 --> 01:54:14.018]  Since we're in Missouri, it affects the Supreme Court cases that we saw a little bit earlier this year when Eric Schmidt, the Attorney General of Missouri, tried to take this case to the Supreme Court.
[01:54:14.578 --> 01:54:24.477]   Kavanaugh and Roberts turned on us, saying that the regulated Well, you're an incredible caller, but let me just say this, Brian.
[01:54:25.077 --> 01:54:27.878]  First off, congratulations for being a trailblazer.
[01:54:28.498 --> 01:54:33.400]  Congratulations for standing up for my medical freedom and your medical freedom and our children's medical freedom.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:34.721]  And you'll be proven right.
[01:54:35.501 --> 01:54:37.942]  No matter how much we give in, they're always going to want more.
[01:54:38.542 --> 01:55:04.873]   And so at a certain point you got to say we draw the line in the sand and it's come out the shots experimental it's not a vaccine it's causing death it's causing disease and they want a litmus test in the military with the shots and in the medical system to get a core of people that will follow any order for the next level of tyranny and that's what this is all is is a litmus test and so you have failed their litmus test of being a slave your wife has Thank you, sir.
[01:55:04.693 --> 01:55:09.052]   litmus test of being a medical tyrant. So all I can say is salute you Brian and
[01:55:09.052 --> 01:55:15.132]   your wife and in the long run you'll be proven right. Thank you sir. Other
[01:55:15.132 --> 01:55:21.252]   closing points on this. Yeah this has bigger impacts at the Supreme Court
[01:55:21.252 --> 01:55:28.493]   because since Kavanaugh and Roberts turn they now decided at the Supreme Court
[01:55:28.493 --> 01:55:34.293]   level that since the regulated entities the hospitals were not pursuing
[01:55:34.293 --> 01:55:39.811]   and punching upward against the the regulation and the threat of the
[01:55:39.811 --> 01:55:45.012]   $700,000 a day fine instead they punch downward on their employees. We haven't
[01:55:45.012 --> 01:55:47.613]  been heard yet.
[01:55:46.165 --> 01:56:04.462]   But when our case, and I believe there are other cases like ours out there, when they start filtering through the court systems, I believe that that precedent where medical workers being the only people who are not allowed to decide their own medical care I believe that precedent has to be overturned.
[01:56:04.662 --> 01:56:05.042]  It does.
[01:56:05.122 --> 01:56:09.284]  And listen, it was already overturned, as you said, to make people take the shots.
[01:56:09.664 --> 01:56:12.986]  But then the bureaucracy still continues with that directive.
[01:56:13.026 --> 01:56:17.868]  So the thing is fraudulent, even in our own corrupt court system, which says a lot.
[01:56:17.928 --> 01:56:19.149]  So, God bless you.
[01:56:19.169 --> 01:56:21.010]  Give us an update very soon, Brian.
[01:56:21.030 --> 01:56:21.350]  Thank you.
[01:56:23.351 --> 01:56:23.531]  Wow.
[01:56:24.451 --> 01:56:26.692]  Putting it all on the line, but they'd lose that baby.
[01:56:26.992 --> 01:56:29.874]  Probably they'd have the shot or the baby would have serious health problems.
[01:56:31.005 --> 01:56:31.685]  It's not a choice.
[01:56:32.546 --> 01:56:33.386]  You gotta say no.
[01:56:34.107 --> 01:56:37.229]  Giving in is the threat long-term for what it creates.
[01:56:37.269 --> 01:56:41.351]  So people like Brian and his wife are the trailblazers we need, the people we need.
[01:56:41.771 --> 01:56:42.752]  They are the leadership we need.
[01:56:42.772 --> 01:56:44.092]  Leadership's doing the right thing, folks.
[01:56:44.112 --> 01:56:48.835]  No matter what the frontal assault is, you know you're right, so you do the right thing.
[01:56:52.017 --> 01:56:53.758]  Let's talk to Sherry in Wisconsin.
[01:56:53.778 --> 01:56:55.439]  She says, reaching out to God.
[01:56:55.919 --> 01:56:56.919]  Sherry, tell us about that.
[01:56:58.040 --> 01:56:58.520]  Hi, Alex.
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:03.241]  I want to put a scenario to you to consider.
[01:57:04.321 --> 01:57:04.981]  Imagine this.
[01:57:05.562 --> 01:57:06.462]  There's a local man.
[01:57:06.482 --> 01:57:09.603]  He is a known murderer.
[01:57:09.623 --> 01:57:10.623]  A vicious one.
[01:57:11.383 --> 01:57:15.504]  But the local laws have sort of protected him.
[01:57:16.785 --> 01:57:18.325]  One day, he gets sick.
[01:57:19.485 --> 01:57:24.907]  And he decides that this is some message that he needs to quit doing what he's doing.
[01:57:26.187 --> 01:57:26.807]  So he heals.
[01:57:27.828 --> 01:57:28.808]  He changes his name.
[01:57:29.986 --> 01:57:31.186]  And he starts a religion.
[01:57:32.727 --> 01:57:34.327]  How do you think that would fly nowadays?
[01:57:35.968 --> 01:57:36.588]  Not too well.
[01:57:38.088 --> 01:57:39.169]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:44.790]  Psalms 19 says, The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul.
[01:57:45.311 --> 01:57:48.512]  The testimonies of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
[01:57:49.152 --> 01:57:55.033]  The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart, and the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
[01:57:55.674 --> 01:58:02.552]   It goes on, and I want to point out to you that I agree with Dr. Bragin when he said, you're kind of a prophet.
[01:58:03.492 --> 01:58:13.179]  You are in a position to share information almost like no other prophet in the Bible has had the opportunity to share information.
[01:58:14.539 --> 01:58:15.720]  I'm talking about Paul.
[01:58:17.321 --> 01:58:21.244]  Paul called it my gospel three times in his writing.
[01:58:22.685 --> 01:58:33.523]   I want to challenge you to consider that The reason things go on is because we have rejected the civil laws, for sure, of the New Testament.
[01:58:33.603 --> 01:58:35.365]  Obviously, the Temple's gone.
[01:58:35.385 --> 01:58:36.886]  AD 70 gone.
[01:58:38.588 --> 01:58:49.319]  But why don't we consider that we need to go back to those laws that teach us right from wrong how to get along with our fellow man and have a good society?
[01:58:50.134 --> 01:58:57.198]  No, I mean, I think what you're saying is the Levitical law is very good as well, and Christ said, I came to fulfill the Old Testament, not to destroy it.
[01:58:59.279 --> 01:59:02.101]  He said, I came to fulfill it, not to end it.
[01:59:03.862 --> 01:59:12.406]  I'm telling you, people need to consider that they are on a... Okay, if I say this, don't you get mad at me.
[01:59:13.467 --> 01:59:36.330]   I consider Christianity to be I think you could say establishment Christianity has its problems, but I'm not getting into an ecclesiastical debate here.
[01:59:36.410 --> 01:59:40.792]  All I know is good is real, evil is real, and we're in a fight between those two forces right now.
[01:59:40.812 --> 01:59:41.632]  Nobody can deny that.
[01:59:42.365 --> 01:59:49.649]  So, my bottom line is, instead of praying, praying, praying for divine intervention, why don't we follow what the laws have taught us to do?
[01:59:50.389 --> 01:59:51.550]  Well, that's what God says.
[01:59:51.630 --> 01:59:56.873]  If you follow my law, you'll be delivered and be successful, and if you don't, you'll be destroyed and go into bondage.
[01:59:56.973 --> 01:59:57.493]  Totally true.
[01:59:57.673 --> 01:59:58.574]  Yes.
[01:59:58.854 --> 02:00:02.156]  That, to me, is what converting the soul, that being reborn.
[02:00:03.076 --> 02:00:04.297]  Thank you so much, Sherry.
[02:00:04.797 --> 02:00:05.577]  Interesting points.
[02:00:05.677 --> 02:00:06.298]  Alright, listen.
[02:00:07.078 --> 02:00:10.420]  I got this whole GMO human cloning stack that is so important.
[02:00:11.564 --> 02:00:13.826]  Got to hit that, but I also promise to get to all your calls.
[02:00:13.866 --> 02:00:21.953]  I'm going to jam your calls in, but I'm going to give each caller 60 seconds when we come back.
[02:00:22.113 --> 02:00:29.260]  So get ready, DJ, and Robert, and Tyler, and Michael, and Heath, and others.
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:29.780]  Get ready.
[02:00:30.361 --> 02:00:32.502]  I'm going to hit this whole other new stack as well.
[02:00:32.522 --> 02:00:32.963]  Stay with us.
[02:00:33.844 --> 02:00:37.066]  Let's go ahead and take a call here from DJ in New York.
[02:00:37.106 --> 02:00:37.967]  DJ, you're on the air.
[02:00:38.007 --> 02:00:38.588]  Thanks for calling.
[02:00:40.202 --> 02:00:42.744]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[02:00:42.844 --> 02:00:43.624]  I'm in the fight, brother.
[02:00:43.644 --> 02:00:44.325]  That's where I need to be.
[02:00:44.585 --> 02:00:45.846]  I'm doing damn well, actually.
[02:00:46.847 --> 02:00:47.867]  All right, that's great.
[02:00:48.308 --> 02:01:03.778]  I was so pleased to get a chance to meet you last summer at the Trump International Hotel, just for a moment, when you were, I don't know, doing a long walks around Central Park, going to the UN, and then you ended up at the border after that.
[02:01:04.299 --> 02:01:06.120]  And I had a nice talk with Tim.
[02:01:07.062 --> 02:01:08.343]  You're a head of security.
[02:01:08.423 --> 02:01:09.543]  What a gentleman he is.
[02:01:09.923 --> 02:01:14.045]  And, uh, you were too worn out from the day and whatever.
[02:01:14.105 --> 02:01:15.205]  I felt a little bad for you.
[02:01:15.245 --> 02:01:17.426]  You looked like such a battle-hardened warrior.
[02:01:17.506 --> 02:01:18.387]  I was so impressed.
[02:01:18.887 --> 02:01:28.111]  I mean, I'm 20 years older than you, but man, the wear and tear that you have, it shows in your composure, but you're strong underneath all that.
[02:01:28.171 --> 02:01:31.332]  You're still soldiering on and fighting the good fight.
[02:01:31.352 --> 02:01:32.953]  And I'm so proud of you.
[02:01:33.073 --> 02:01:35.354]  The spirit is strong, but the flesh is weak.
[02:01:36.724 --> 02:01:37.264]  That's right.
[02:01:37.404 --> 02:02:03.509]  So, what I want to bring to your attention, because I know we've got to get on to other callers, and it was entertaining to listen, particularly to Joe from Florida, because his views about electromagnetics are something I'm very tuned into, because that's the one thing, if we had access to the right electromagnetic pulse technology, we could destroy all the nanotechnology in all these... Oh, that's all the real technology.
[02:02:03.589 --> 02:02:04.589]  Everything's electrochemical.
[02:02:05.618 --> 02:02:10.779]  Yeah, well, they could kill all that off with the right technology, but they're hiding that.
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:29.565]  So what I wanted to talk about, to push out into the open with you, what I wanted to share with you when I met you, but there was no time, is that here in New York, the epicenter of all this, where the UN is, where the money system is centered, is this place called Roosevelt Island.
[02:02:30.725 --> 02:02:34.166]  And on Roosevelt Island, it used to be a penal colony.
[02:02:35.247 --> 02:02:54.398]  Among other things, and so you have a monument to FDR, and you have on that same area of the island a new tech center, the Cornell University Tech Center, funded by Bloomberg and the government of Israel.
[02:02:55.078 --> 02:03:00.281]  This is something that certainly would be a great Gregg Reese report.
[02:03:01.044 --> 02:03:08.089]  What they're doing in that university is developing the drones of the future, from very tiny ones to large ones.
[02:03:09.109 --> 02:03:15.573]  And those drones are going to be used in their next stage of the war, when the chaos really begins.
[02:03:16.794 --> 02:03:25.420]  And those drones are going to be charged at points that are on the tops of buildings, where they can land and recharge.
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:30.423]  There'll be many points around the city, and this model will get rolled out nationally.
[02:03:31.109 --> 02:03:34.750]  So that they can go after us and follow us.
[02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:44.832]  And many times we may be able to see the drone, like I see the one going up and down the East River, keeping an eye on the UN, but there'll be small ones that we won't see.
[02:03:45.492 --> 02:03:52.933]  So we're talking today about the, you know, surveillance state and how we're going to deal with that.
[02:03:53.313 --> 02:04:03.359]   And it's going to be like the calm before the storm when When like, for example, cell phones first appeared and people looked at it all strange and then all of a sudden everybody had it.
[02:04:03.919 --> 02:04:04.760]  Well, that's what's going to happen.
[02:04:04.780 --> 02:04:05.881]  It's a robot takeover.
[02:04:05.921 --> 02:04:06.281]  You're right.
[02:04:06.641 --> 02:04:07.882]  The drone's the tip of the spear.
[02:04:08.463 --> 02:04:10.865]  Not that technology's bad, but that it's programmable.
[02:04:11.245 --> 02:04:12.866]  It'll follow orders when humans won't.
[02:04:13.206 --> 02:04:13.967]  You're absolutely right.
[02:04:14.007 --> 02:04:14.748]  God bless you, DJ.
[02:04:14.808 --> 02:04:16.029]  It was good to meet you in New York.
[02:04:16.809 --> 02:04:18.991]  Let's go to Robert in Pennsylvania.
[02:04:19.051 --> 02:04:19.791]  Robert, you're on the air.
[02:04:19.812 --> 02:04:20.092]  Go ahead.
[02:04:21.656 --> 02:04:34.843]  Hey Alex, yeah I'm just calling to see if you guys made any progress on what that abnormal tissue that's been growing in people and getting called blood clots is.
[02:04:35.403 --> 02:04:45.713]   It is growing some type of Nanotech quasi-metal thing in the body using the body's own tissues to grow these tumors.
[02:04:45.793 --> 02:04:48.314]  It's designed to basically take the body over.
[02:04:48.334 --> 02:04:49.975]  I mean, we've had major scientists on.
[02:04:50.015 --> 02:04:50.836]  It's definitely going on.
[02:04:51.276 --> 02:04:52.677]  There's huge studies documenting it.
[02:04:52.697 --> 02:04:55.118]  I mean, this is a giant assault.
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:05:04.066]  Well, to me, when they were showing the pictures on one of the days that you were gone, they had the electron microscope in there.
[02:05:04.426 --> 02:05:09.751]  To me, it's pretty obvious that that is malformed or mutated nerve tissue.
[02:05:12.413 --> 02:05:12.893]  Well, you're right.
[02:05:12.913 --> 02:05:15.696]  The way it goes out through the flesh looks like it's following nerve endings.
[02:05:17.037 --> 02:05:32.197]   Yeah, and to me, it wouldn't surprise me if that's just a rollout of The next step towards what Elon Musk and the other people are trying to implement with the Neuralink.
[02:05:32.417 --> 02:05:41.741]  I think they're about to find the same brick walls that the secret research organizations have ran into.
[02:05:41.761 --> 02:05:42.161]  That's right.
[02:05:42.181 --> 02:05:48.504]  They haven't grown the neural implant interface points in the human population.
[02:05:48.524 --> 02:05:48.884]  It won't work.
[02:05:50.054 --> 02:05:58.897]  Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me that if a full autopsy on those people, they would find out that their neural tissue was also growing in the same manner.
[02:05:58.917 --> 02:06:04.559]  You only describe this brother as an alien takeover.
[02:06:05.900 --> 02:06:33.614]   Yeah, well, I mean, like Elon is doing his neural link in order to, as he states, control AI or, you know, But the thing is, is you can't actually have anything other than brute force machine learning technology as AI unless you have quantum computing, which there is only one way to actually generate intelligence, and that is with a living brain.
[02:06:33.634 --> 02:06:55.126]   So what Elon is trying to do is actually create AI, true cognitive AI, Through that type of interface, but it also appears that the government is attempting to do the same thing, and they just got 95% of the world's population to donate DNA samples to perfecting it.
[02:06:56.426 --> 02:07:03.387]  I actually have a stack of news that I said I would get you today, but I'll have to cover at the start of the show tomorrow, that actually they've announced all that.
[02:07:03.608 --> 02:07:05.528]  It's all being announced, which is insane right now.
[02:07:06.894 --> 02:07:19.829]  Yeah, and it's pretty obvious that the trends towards augmented reality, I mean, you look at all of the filters on Snapchat and TikTok, that's all implementation of augmented reality.
[02:07:20.658 --> 02:07:27.281]  Well, with as terrible as the world is getting, you can see that all the cars and all the buildings... Yeah, they're not going to let you commute.
[02:07:27.321 --> 02:07:29.882]  They're going to force you to live in this system.
[02:07:29.902 --> 02:07:38.085]  Then robots and computers will produce the food and water and medicine you need to survive while you're being forced to integrate with machines to survive within that system.
[02:07:38.125 --> 02:07:39.445]  That's the admitted plan, sir.
[02:07:39.966 --> 02:07:42.607]  I meant to cover that today and I didn't, but you just covered it right now.
[02:07:42.667 --> 02:07:43.347]  Thank you so much.
[02:07:43.407 --> 02:07:44.307]  Amazing point, Robert.
[02:07:45.128 --> 02:07:47.649]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Tyler in Kansas.
[02:07:47.689 --> 02:07:48.349]  Tyler, go ahead.
[02:07:49.298 --> 02:07:50.738]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[02:07:50.999 --> 02:07:51.699]  I can, go ahead.
[02:07:52.359 --> 02:07:54.960]  Hey man, I appreciate you and everything you've done.
[02:07:54.980 --> 02:07:56.700]  I've been a listener for a while.
[02:07:56.720 --> 02:07:57.421]  Appreciate you.
[02:07:58.101 --> 02:08:00.301]  You know, you're great and thank you for the fight.
[02:08:01.942 --> 02:08:08.984]  All I was going to cover is I have a four-month-old daughter, my youngest, and no way am I getting that COVID shot.
[02:08:09.064 --> 02:08:12.980]   I don't care what they, it's crazy that they're even I'm not saying that.
[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:14.301]  Why would adults even get that?
[02:08:14.381 --> 02:08:27.931]  But the fight's getting strong because I've been seeing it in doctor's offices for my kids that they'll put on there if you're going for a physical or anything, if your child's had a COVID shot, that they're not going to pass the physical because of their heart.
[02:08:29.292 --> 02:08:30.713]  So that's another sign.
[02:08:30.793 --> 02:08:33.315]  Even police departments are saying that.
[02:08:33.355 --> 02:08:33.755]  Yeah.
[02:08:34.556 --> 02:08:37.738]  And so that's another thing that people are starting to learn.
[02:08:39.460 --> 02:09:01.464]  Waiting room like what they can't get a physical and it's yeah, it's it's that serious So I just wanted to say hey, thank you, and I've got everybody in my office Here on your coffee, and we're getting on the iodine everything and we're gonna support you as much as we can Well, thank you brother, but you know go back to what you said Tyler because that's so huge I'm seeing news reports.
[02:09:01.544 --> 02:09:09.105]   It's being confirmed Police departments are saying Hey The Ironman in Hawaii.
[02:09:09.566 --> 02:09:13.249]  The police department had a bunch of extra ambulances saying get ready for heart attacks and they happened.
[02:09:13.950 --> 02:09:23.259]  And even the police department knows this is going on, but you're going to doctor's offices and they've got signs up saying, sorry, you can't take the physical if you've had the COVID shot, you may have a heart attack.
[02:09:24.019 --> 02:09:24.199]  Yeah.
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:24.580]  Yeah.
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:29.044]  Your heart, you will not, you will literally not have, because of your heart, if you've got the COVID shot.
[02:09:29.084 --> 02:09:30.185]  And that's for kids as well.
[02:09:32.140 --> 02:09:38.301]  100 plus thousand times the number I was seeing increase in heart attacks and blood problems with professional athletes.
[02:09:38.382 --> 02:09:39.842]  I mean, this is huge.
[02:09:40.482 --> 02:09:41.322]  They hit us with it.
[02:09:41.422 --> 02:09:42.062]  They're doing it.
[02:09:42.482 --> 02:09:44.703]  They're just testing to see if we wake up to it and say no.
[02:09:45.043 --> 02:09:46.083]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:09:46.603 --> 02:09:49.684]  All right, Heath and Michael, we're going to go to break for two minutes.
[02:09:49.704 --> 02:09:53.345]  I'm going to come back and finish up with you guys and then Jay Dyer's taking over.
[02:09:53.425 --> 02:09:56.666]  And then I'm keeping the stack and a few other stacks I didn't get to.
[02:09:57.654 --> 02:09:59.035]  I will cover this stack tomorrow.
[02:09:59.876 --> 02:10:05.659]  I could spend an hour on this stack alone with everything the last few callers just talked about.
[02:10:05.699 --> 02:10:07.500]  Please don't forget preparetoday.com.
[02:10:08.861 --> 02:10:15.045]  High quality, storable foods, water filters, air filters, all the highest quality, the lowest prices, preparedness items, survival items.

[02:10:22.410 --> 02:10:25.072]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:10:25.792 --> 02:10:26.873]  It's the Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:28.297 --> 02:10:28.817]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[02:10:28.637 --> 02:10:30.877]  Hour number four with Jay Dyer.
[02:10:30.877 --> 02:10:37.277]  And in one hour, the war room with Owen Schroer.
[02:10:37.277 --> 02:10:40.816]  We're talking to Heath and Michael right now.
[02:10:40.816 --> 02:10:42.677]  And then Jay Dyer, always thought provoking.
[02:10:42.677 --> 02:10:44.437]  Man, is he well researched.
[02:10:44.437 --> 02:10:45.557]  You wanna know what's really going on?
[02:10:45.557 --> 02:10:48.117]  Tune in right now when he comes up in five minutes.
[02:10:48.117 --> 02:10:51.316]   But Michael in Oklahoma, you're on the air, and then Heath, go ahead.
[02:10:51.316 --> 02:10:53.397]  Hey, what's up, Alex?
[02:10:53.397 --> 02:10:54.797]  Good to talk to you.
[02:10:54.797 --> 02:10:56.557]  Yeah, thanks for what you do, man.
[02:10:57.516 --> 02:11:02.316]  So you're asking people about how to stop the globalists.
[02:11:02.316 --> 02:11:07.896]   And I think this concept is perfectly illustrated by the race for governor in Pennsylvania.
[02:11:08.413 --> 02:11:22.618]  You have Josh Shapiro on the Democrats and Doug Mastriano for the Republicans, and I was just wondering if you had any, what your take on the race for governor in Pennsylvania was.
[02:11:25.059 --> 02:11:27.920]  I mean, I've followed it some, but what's your view on that?
[02:11:28.968 --> 02:11:43.475]  Well, the first time I ever noticed Josh Shapiro, he was on TV bragging after the 2020 election about how he received more votes than any other politician in Pennsylvania's history, which is kind of a weird red flag when you think about it.
[02:11:45.256 --> 02:11:51.379]  And, you know, there's not too much information about him when you try to research him online.
[02:11:52.100 --> 02:12:05.265]   And, yeah, I was just hoping that maybe you had... We'll take Dr. Oz as soon as he got Trump's Endorsement, and as soon as he won his primary, now he's dropped Trump from his website.
[02:12:06.526 --> 02:12:22.641]  Yeah, well, it's the same thing when I said Josh Shapiro back in 2020 was bragging pretty heavily about how he received more votes than any politician in Pennsylvania's history, but now that point is not anywhere in his campaign, you know, website or materials.
[02:12:22.661 --> 02:12:23.762]  He doesn't really talk about it.
[02:12:24.562 --> 02:12:30.148]   And, you know, the whole thing just seems Yeah, unusual.
[02:12:30.728 --> 02:12:37.711]  His whole thing is unusual, and I basically was just wondering if you had any opinion or information about that.
[02:12:38.571 --> 02:12:41.092]  I'll be honest with you, I know about the race.
[02:12:41.392 --> 02:12:45.654]  I'm not really following it much, and so it sounds like you know a lot more than I do.
[02:12:46.234 --> 02:12:47.014]  But thank you so much.
[02:12:47.594 --> 02:12:49.075]  Heath in Maine, you're on the air.
[02:12:49.135 --> 02:12:51.456]  Last caller before Jay Dyer takes over.
[02:12:52.776 --> 02:12:54.357]  Alex Jones, thanks for taking my call.
[02:12:54.657 --> 02:12:54.917]  Thank you.
[02:12:55.956 --> 02:12:58.897]  Hey, I just want to mention that I've seen all your documentaries.
[02:12:58.977 --> 02:12:59.457]  I own them.
[02:12:59.697 --> 02:13:01.277]  I awoke in 2012 because of you.
[02:13:01.517 --> 02:13:04.938]  I've got bumper stickers on the back of my car, so I am an info warrior.
[02:13:05.898 --> 02:13:07.038]  I did have a question, though.
[02:13:07.798 --> 02:13:10.259]  Do you remember the Halliburton Black Coffins?
[02:13:11.639 --> 02:13:13.520]  I saw that on, I think it was Jesse Ventura.
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:17.380]  Are they still going to be using that, or is that just lost and forgotten about now?
[02:13:18.541 --> 02:13:25.302]  Well, there's all sorts of masquerade programs and incinerators and crematoriums ready and FEMA, you know.
[02:13:26.305 --> 02:13:27.586]  Yeah, so more about the lockdown.
[02:13:27.405 --> 02:13:33.405]   up with plastic coffin liners and so that stuff goes on and so I don't know.
[02:13:33.405 --> 02:13:37.905]   They're saying a new pandemic's here, the UN's about to roll it out, monkey pox,
[02:13:37.905 --> 02:13:44.166]   they're the ones behind it all. Yeah so more about the lockdown, so the masks
[02:13:44.166 --> 02:13:48.925]   they're coming back, the lockdowns, checkpoints. The UN has announced that it's
[02:13:48.925 --> 02:13:52.885]   imminently about to declare a new global emergency and bring on the same controls
[02:13:52.885 --> 02:13:56.765]  AP reports for the last two years.
[02:13:54.968 --> 02:14:00.534]  I don't know if they'll actually do it or what's going to happen, but they say it's about to happen.
[02:14:00.574 --> 02:14:05.638]  I mean, I have two kids, eight and three, and no one in my family has taken that COVID shot.
[02:14:05.999 --> 02:14:10.603]  And I actually got discharged from a university, so I've been gypped out of an education because of it.
[02:14:13.246 --> 02:14:19.968]  Now my youngest is in that ballpark again, and man, it's just like evil is just, it's spreading rampant right now.
[02:14:21.189 --> 02:14:21.709]  Exactly.
[02:14:21.929 --> 02:14:23.850]  Evil is testing what it can get away with.
[02:14:24.430 --> 02:14:28.632]  Evil is putting us all through a test to see if they can launch the next big attack.
[02:14:28.672 --> 02:14:32.703]   And I can tell you, We're almost passing what they want to do.
[02:14:33.124 --> 02:14:35.385]  We want to fail the test where they say no.
[02:14:35.965 --> 02:14:37.826]  But we're almost going to fail the test.
[02:14:37.846 --> 02:14:41.548]  We're right on the knife's edge of they may have to back off because people are awake.
[02:14:41.588 --> 02:14:42.409]  But they're testing.
[02:14:42.889 --> 02:14:43.589]  They're tracking.
[02:14:43.629 --> 02:14:44.530]  Thank you so much, Keith.
[02:14:44.650 --> 02:14:44.970]  All right.
[02:14:46.581 --> 02:14:48.062]  Powerful broadcast today.
[02:14:48.082 --> 02:14:57.866]  Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, author, researcher, is about to drill into the globalist quotes, their own admissions, what they're up to, on the other side for the next 55 minutes.
[02:14:57.906 --> 02:15:00.087]  And then, Owen Schroer in the war room.
[02:15:00.447 --> 02:15:05.830]  Only way you find it, it's infowars.com forward slash show, and great stations around the country, and of course, Bandod video.
[02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:08.911]  Very thankful to everybody, very thankful to the crew, great to be back.
[02:15:09.331 --> 02:15:10.072]  We love you all.
[02:15:10.632 --> 02:15:13.193]  Spreading the word is an act of resistance, so please spread the word.
[02:15:13.473 --> 02:15:14.994]  The globalists are counting on you not doing it.
[02:15:15.598 --> 02:15:16.899]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:15:16.959 --> 02:15:21.460]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis, coming in on the fourth hour today.
[02:15:22.201 --> 02:15:28.543]  And as Alex mentioned, I do typically just lecture from the global elite writings themselves.
[02:15:28.603 --> 02:15:35.886]  And today we're going to do that with a book that we haven't yet covered, which a couple summers ago I waited my entire way through.
[02:15:35.906 --> 02:15:37.587]  I don't know how I made it through it, but I did.
[02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:44.265]  And that's a book by a lesser-known globalist who has a lot of influence when it comes to deep ecology.
[02:15:44.525 --> 02:15:59.638]  And that's going to be important because deep ecology is one of the cut-out kind of fronts that the elite use to re-engineer all of life and all of society, especially the idea that we need to alter everything that we think about man and his relationship to society.
[02:16:00.307 --> 02:16:09.395]  Especially in the West, because of capitalism, because of consumerism, and because we are evil, carbon-emitting, you know, toxic entities on the planet.
[02:16:10.036 --> 02:16:12.038]  And that is the character Fritjof Capra.
[02:16:12.118 --> 02:16:20.986]  Fritjof Capra is an important figure in the global elite structure, because he has been writing for many years about what he called the turning point.
[02:16:21.166 --> 02:16:22.888]  And this was a book he wrote way back in 1982.
[02:16:24.873 --> 02:16:26.975]  And it was very ahead of its time.
[02:16:27.015 --> 02:16:29.717]  Now, he was running after the counterculture.
[02:16:29.777 --> 02:16:32.159]  So the counterculture of the 60s had just come about.
[02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:52.457]  That was pretty much, for the most part, fostered by the elite, fostered by the system for the purpose of social engineering, that actually has connections back to not just the wealthiest people in the West, the big families, the oligarchs, but British intelligence had a big role in fostering and promoting psychedelia, psychedelic rock, the Beatles, these kinds of things.
[02:16:53.542 --> 02:17:02.727]  And so Copper is writing a few decades after that and saying, now we're at this point where society, science, and the new culture can emerge.
[02:17:02.787 --> 02:17:16.133]  And so the title of the book itself, Turning Point, Science, Society, and the Rising Culture, itself tells you that they view culture as a social engineering mechanism and tool.
[02:17:16.814 --> 02:17:18.535]  And he's saying that now we're at the turning point.
[02:17:18.595 --> 02:17:20.215]  Now the 80s are coming.
[02:17:20.235 --> 02:17:22.857]  We're going to have the rollout of what he calls a new physics.
[02:17:24.176 --> 02:17:28.692]  And a new way of thinking about... So the book begins by saying...
[02:17:30.564 --> 02:17:34.146]  You are a cell in Gaia to be recycled.
[02:17:34.406 --> 02:17:42.631]  So he says we've got to get away from this idea of thinking that we're individuals, that we exist with an individual will or individual human persons.
[02:17:42.671 --> 02:17:43.492]  That's not real.
[02:17:43.552 --> 02:17:46.554]  That's something that the West has made up, right?
[02:17:46.754 --> 02:17:53.538]  That's a philosophy that Christianity made up, that Moses made up, that, you know, biblical religion made up.
[02:17:53.578 --> 02:18:04.891]   He says that now what we need to understand is that through a systems view of life, we are all part of a collective So it's a total submersion of the individual into the monistic collective.
[02:18:04.972 --> 02:18:09.699]  Monism and philosophy is just the fancy word for everything is one, man.
[02:18:09.759 --> 02:18:11.202]  Like, we're all just one, dude.
[02:18:12.618 --> 02:18:19.904]  If you sat around and meditated enough, you would see that you're just me, man, and I'm just you, man.
[02:18:20.905 --> 02:18:26.289]  We're all just toes on the feet of Terrence McKenna, man.
[02:18:26.329 --> 02:18:28.270]  Do you want to be one with Terrence McKenna's toes?
[02:18:28.390 --> 02:18:28.690]  I don't.
[02:18:29.191 --> 02:18:29.791]  His bunions?
[02:18:30.071 --> 02:18:30.352]  I don't.
[02:18:30.472 --> 02:18:34.515]  But if all things are one, you are one with Terrence McKenna's bunions.
[02:18:36.050 --> 02:18:38.311]  And that's not a kind of a universe I want to live in.
[02:18:38.371 --> 02:18:39.271]  I'm just joking.
[02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:40.512]  But that is the view.
[02:18:40.592 --> 02:18:49.875]  The idea is literally that you are a cell in Gaia, which is just the whole Mother Earth, and you are to be recycled.
[02:18:50.356 --> 02:18:58.739]  And if you don't go along with the ecosystem as part of that natural cycle, you're a cancer on the planet.
[02:18:59.759 --> 02:19:04.561]  You see, this is the collectivist philosophy that the elite have chosen to go with.
[02:19:05.382 --> 02:19:24.036]  Right around the time of the Club of Rome and all that in the mid 20th century at the behest of the Rockefellers and the wealthiest people on the planet to foister upon the masses a new paradigm, a new philosophy that life itself is something that is not a right, but something that the elite should dole out.
[02:19:24.496 --> 02:19:25.457]  You don't have a right to live.
[02:19:25.477 --> 02:19:26.558]  You don't have a right to have children.
[02:19:26.798 --> 02:19:29.060]  All these things are going to be reversed in the new society.
[02:19:29.080 --> 02:19:32.222]  And so they needed a philosophy and they needed a science.
[02:19:32.522 --> 02:19:38.660]   That's the key thing here with Mr. Kopra is that Fridolf Kopra was a physicist.
[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:41.041]  And so what he did was he wrote a lot of books.
[02:19:41.202 --> 02:19:46.244]  He did a lot of studies on not just physics, but physics in a mystical sense.
[02:19:46.524 --> 02:19:48.785]  So he's a mystical physicist, you might say.
[02:19:49.606 --> 02:19:55.869]  And he does a lot of critiques of rationalism and Western materialism, which are good.
[02:19:56.209 --> 02:20:00.652]  So you start reading this book and he does several chapters early on critiquing materialism.
[02:20:00.712 --> 02:20:01.932]  It's like, oh, yeah, exactly.
[02:20:01.972 --> 02:20:03.213]  It's actually a great point.
[02:20:04.026 --> 02:20:08.329]  And a lot of the environmental people, you know, the deep ecologists, at times they have good insight.
[02:20:08.389 --> 02:20:20.338]  They'll say things like, we need to be careful with GMOs, we need to watch out for GMO food, we need to watch out for, you know, polluting the planet, corporate pollution and so forth, which are legitimate concerns.
[02:20:21.047 --> 02:20:29.993]  However, that all got co-opted and shifted into something that's a complete 100% establishment controlled and run operating system.
[02:20:30.573 --> 02:20:36.978]  And for example, you can look at the Earth Charter, which was this idea of a new covenant, a new Ten Commandments, so to speak.
[02:20:37.758 --> 02:20:43.162]  And Mr. Copra is one of the international council members of the Earth Charter.
[02:20:44.063 --> 02:20:49.026]  So you can see that what he kind of does is take physics and kind of blend it into new agey stuff.
[02:20:49.841 --> 02:20:58.867]  Not because he's seriously seeking some kind of mystical enlightenment or truth, but rather because it's an engineering process.
[02:20:58.927 --> 02:21:09.613]  It's a way to control people into austerity living, green living, living in a coom pod in a giant mega city, this kind of stuff.
[02:21:09.693 --> 02:21:11.434]  That's literally what the whole thing is.
[02:21:11.935 --> 02:21:16.202]   And once you see through that, it's kind of like, This isn't really about mysticism.
[02:21:16.522 --> 02:21:18.303]  This isn't about this kind of stuff.
[02:21:18.343 --> 02:21:30.346]  I mean, take for example, another example of this, the esotericist Manley P. Hall, the famous esoteric mystical philosopher out in California.
[02:21:31.446 --> 02:21:36.567]  Manley P. Hall, he has this lecture series, like 20 lectures on astrology.
[02:21:37.566 --> 02:21:44.432]  I remember listening to this 10-15 years ago, and I was sitting there listening to all these lectures, and I was like, okay, hmm, this is interesting.
[02:21:44.472 --> 02:21:48.935]  And, you know, he's talking about all these different occult schools and the Arcana.
[02:21:49.476 --> 02:21:58.783]  And then the last lecture in the whole series is him saying, oh, by the way, the whole purpose of all this is to get you to accept the United Nations and world socialism.
[02:22:00.104 --> 02:22:10.238]   So the whole purpose of all your esoteric jibber-jabber about astrology was 20-something lectures to conclude And tell everybody that they have to accept world socialism.
[02:22:11.578 --> 02:22:11.898]  Literally.
[02:22:13.339 --> 02:22:14.419]  Now, that's interesting.
[02:22:14.439 --> 02:22:22.182]  There's a little side note here that this week I've been reading a lot on gurus and gurus in the new age and its actual origins, right?
[02:22:22.202 --> 02:22:25.443]  It goes back to Madame Blavatsky, Annie Besant, Alice Bailey.
[02:22:26.223 --> 02:22:33.205]  And one thing that I had overlooked was the connection between, for example, Madame Blavatsky and intelligence, intelligence operations.
[02:22:34.116 --> 02:22:36.457]  Did you know that she was in the circles of a lot of spies?
[02:22:36.517 --> 02:22:38.238]  And perhaps she might have even been a spy herself.
[02:22:38.318 --> 02:22:38.718]  We don't know.
[02:22:38.758 --> 02:22:39.379]  It's speculative.
[02:22:39.399 --> 02:22:41.500]  She might have been a British intelligence asset.
[02:22:41.520 --> 02:22:45.562]  But she was in the circles of a lot of people like Nicholas Rorick, who were Soviet spies.
[02:22:47.585 --> 02:22:51.186]  Many of the Bolsheviks, for example, were very interested in Satanism and the occult.
[02:22:51.206 --> 02:22:58.648]  There's a guy named Gleb Boki, who is a famous Bolshevist handler, who was also into espionage and the occult.
[02:22:59.048 --> 02:23:10.632]  And we start to realize, wait a minute, maybe the Ascended Masters that Crowley and Madame Blavatsky were interacting with, perhaps, as Dr. Richard Spence argues in his book, they might have actually just been handlers.
[02:23:11.152 --> 02:23:22.365]   Now, I'm not saying that it's impossible, that she couldn't have been Talking to Ascended Masters and all that, but she is the mother of the New Age movement as well as Elsa Kroli.
[02:23:22.405 --> 02:23:28.747]  And it's interesting that both of them are confirmed to have at least some degree of connection to intelligence agents and assets.
[02:23:28.907 --> 02:23:53.756]   Kroli himself was an MI5 asset, did propaganda work at the time of World War I, and then was involved in various espionage operations at the behest of Maxwell Knight, Ian Fleming, and other British spymasters and British intelligence So there's a clear connection here with this British intelligence fascination with the New Age, the occult, and helping to foster that.
[02:23:54.896 --> 02:24:09.920]  And the first time that the term is used, for example, New Age, I can think back to, I think there's a Scottish Rite journal which has something from Blavatsky quoted in it, and she says, the new age of humanity will come into being through public schooling.
[02:24:10.703 --> 02:24:17.573]  And so she saw this as a millennial kind of ushering in of the kingdom of God, which for her was the brotherhood of man.
[02:24:18.274 --> 02:24:25.792]   And then we find out that later individuals like Alice Bailey, she had a 10 point plan of how to bring about
[02:24:25.792 --> 02:24:28.832]  this new age as a disciple of Blavatsky.
[02:24:28.832 --> 02:24:34.832]   And she said it would be through schooling and the infiltration of religion through these agents.
[02:24:34.832 --> 02:24:40.432]   So this is a real thing, this infiltration, this espionage, this promotion of that from the top.
[02:24:40.432 --> 02:24:42.672]  And I have to give credit to Greg Reese.
[02:24:42.672 --> 02:24:47.832]   Greg Reese called me this week and he actually reminded me of that, about the 10 point plan from Alice Bailey.
[02:24:47.832 --> 02:24:50.432]  So shout out to Greg Reese, go check out his videos.
[02:24:50.432 --> 02:24:53.032]   I don't want to steal his thunder if he's making a video on that.
[02:24:53.032 --> 02:24:54.233]  So give credit to Greg Reese.
[02:24:54.233 --> 02:25:03.172]   But it connects directly into what Frito Copra, Frito Coppercorn is talking about with his physics, his new
[02:25:03.172 --> 02:25:05.132]  physics and where they want to take us.
[02:25:05.132 --> 02:25:09.431]   Don't go anywhere. This is the Alex Jones Show. I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, Jay Zanalsis.
[02:25:09.431 --> 02:25:13.431]  Welcome back to Alex Jones Show.
[02:25:13.539 --> 02:25:17.763]  We are in very mystical situations.
[02:25:19.325 --> 02:25:24.270]  And the secret to gurus is guru's booger whistle.
[02:25:25.331 --> 02:25:28.735]  Did you know that the secret to all the gurus is the guru's booger whistle?
[02:25:28.775 --> 02:25:30.637]  It actually hits us frequently.
[02:25:31.257 --> 02:25:33.880]  It actually invokes entities on the celestial plane.
[02:25:33.920 --> 02:25:45.259]   That's the secret to how the gurus are actually Actually mind-controlling everybody, so they put you to sleep with that booger whistle they all have at the end of every one of their sentences, especially if there's an s-word, right?
[02:25:45.599 --> 02:25:46.780]  Gurush!
[02:25:48.781 --> 02:25:52.103]  If you've watched enough Osho or Sadhguru, you'll notice that, right?
[02:25:52.523 --> 02:25:58.887]  And by the way, you notice the gurus that are actually promoted by World Economic Forum, like Sadhguru there, right?
[02:25:58.907 --> 02:26:01.789]  I mean, he actually comes on and says, we need less people!
[02:26:03.996 --> 02:26:07.098]  He's like a, he's like a evil suntan Santa Claus, right?
[02:26:07.318 --> 02:26:08.939]  We need to get more people.
[02:26:11.881 --> 02:26:12.702]  That's an actual clip.
[02:26:12.722 --> 02:26:13.502]  I'm not making that up.
[02:26:13.583 --> 02:26:15.204]  I think Alex has played that quite a bit.
[02:26:15.284 --> 02:26:18.166]  The side guru talking about getting rid of most people.
[02:26:19.326 --> 02:26:24.490]  Anyway, so we're a cell on the surface of Gaia's skin to be recycled.
[02:26:24.510 --> 02:26:26.651]  We're going to be exfoliated off of Mama Gaia.
[02:26:27.532 --> 02:26:37.174]   Um, and he says that, One of the characters, interestingly, who is quoted in this book was CIA mind control and culture guy Gregory Bateson.
[02:26:38.415 --> 02:26:45.119]  And he also ties into this because it's, oh yes, mind is just part of the global process.
[02:26:45.159 --> 02:26:46.180]  So let's get into the book.
[02:26:46.240 --> 02:26:48.821]  Those are quotes at the beginning of the book, by the way.
[02:26:49.782 --> 02:26:54.385]  Friedel Copper, like all the other global elites, says, we're in a crisis, crisis, crisis, crisis.
[02:26:54.705 --> 02:26:56.486]  Every global elite book starts with this.
[02:26:56.586 --> 02:26:59.919]   It's like they're written By an algorithm.
[02:26:59.979 --> 02:27:02.781]  It's like, it's the same cookie cutter thing.
[02:27:03.081 --> 02:27:04.141]  We're in a crisis.
[02:27:04.782 --> 02:27:10.564]  The world has developed nuclear weapons and we're all going to die and there's going to be epidemics, which is interesting.
[02:27:10.584 --> 02:27:11.805]  He does mention epidemics.
[02:27:12.545 --> 02:27:16.547]  And he says that there's not enough energy to go around and we don't have enough resources.
[02:27:18.368 --> 02:27:22.930]  And so he says, if we don't kill off everybody, everybody's going to die.
[02:27:22.950 --> 02:27:24.030]  I'm not joking.
[02:27:24.050 --> 02:27:27.212]  They all say, it's like, we got to kill you because if we don't kill you, you'll die.
[02:27:29.617 --> 02:27:32.043]  I guess in guru logic that actually makes sense, right?
[02:27:32.063 --> 02:27:34.789]  Because guru logic is always telling you to accept contradiction.
[02:27:35.130 --> 02:27:36.573]  Accept the contradictions!
[02:27:38.408 --> 02:27:41.049]  If we do not kill you, you will die.
[02:27:41.469 --> 02:27:43.369]  They took the stones from here.
[02:27:44.690 --> 02:27:46.930]  I mean, we're talking Temple of Doom stuff, literally, right?
[02:27:46.970 --> 02:27:51.491]  Everybody thinks about the thuggies, Temple of Doom, and like, oh, they're so evil, the thuggy cult.
[02:27:51.531 --> 02:27:58.853]  These people are more evil than the thug... at least the thuggy culture, like, openly, you know, ripping the hearts out.
[02:27:59.273 --> 02:28:00.213]  Kalima!
[02:28:01.013 --> 02:28:02.494]  And everybody freaks out about that, right?
[02:28:02.514 --> 02:28:02.794]  But then...
[02:28:03.829 --> 02:28:07.991]  Sadhguru gets up there, Klaus gets up there, all promoted by the same people.
[02:28:08.011 --> 02:28:09.771]  We're much better than everybody.
[02:28:10.192 --> 02:28:11.652]  Oh, so spiritual, bro!
[02:28:11.712 --> 02:28:12.593]  It's so spiritual!
[02:28:12.713 --> 02:28:16.634]  It's such a great message for humanity to kill everybody!
[02:28:18.635 --> 02:28:20.496]  Anyway, he says, crisis, crisis, crisis.
[02:28:20.516 --> 02:28:22.316]  They always start their books, we're all in a crisis.
[02:28:22.857 --> 02:28:31.614]   And the crisis is, he says, the civilizational patterns that are leading to Too much consumerism.
[02:28:31.634 --> 02:28:32.295]  Too much stuff.
[02:28:32.315 --> 02:28:34.676]  Too much wealth.
[02:28:35.857 --> 02:28:44.362]  And so, since everything is evolving, he says, as all the global elite books say, we gotta step up and steer the evolution.
[02:28:45.023 --> 02:28:47.464]  If we don't steer evolution, it's gonna go haywire.
[02:28:47.484 --> 02:28:48.345]  It's gonna go crazy.
[02:28:48.365 --> 02:28:51.447]  Everybody's gonna be mutating and we just can't have that.
[02:28:51.507 --> 02:28:53.648]  So we gotta steer evolution in the right direction.
[02:28:53.668 --> 02:28:59.092]  And the only way to do that, he says, is to get rid of fossil fuels.
[02:28:59.915 --> 02:29:00.596]  Shocker, right?
[02:29:01.257 --> 02:29:02.498]  Fossil fuels, fossil fuels.
[02:29:02.538 --> 02:29:03.740]  Now, why do they always want to get rid of it?
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:06.122]  Well, it's not really about fossil fuels.
[02:29:06.182 --> 02:29:11.989]  It's not really about oil and, you know, pollution, greenhouse gas.
[02:29:12.069 --> 02:29:12.650]  That's not really.
[02:29:12.690 --> 02:29:16.134]  Those are all covers because it's an economic attack.
[02:29:16.807 --> 02:29:19.408]  Okay, so let's decode the globalese here.
[02:29:19.428 --> 02:29:24.929]  It's nothing to do with oil because they care about, you know, and by the way, that's not fossils, okay?
[02:29:25.049 --> 02:29:27.770]  Oil isn't dinosaur juice, okay?
[02:29:28.110 --> 02:29:34.432]  Pretty sure that's not what oil is, but these people still, everybody still uses this terminology as if that's what it is.
[02:29:34.552 --> 02:29:36.833]  It's crushed up dinosaurs, you really believe that?
[02:29:38.333 --> 02:29:59.198]   I don't know what oil is, something abiogenetic or something like that, but regardless, he says, Science will have to tell us how to settle this process that's kind of going haywire, and we need to have some kind of balance between the relationship that man has to nature that's out of whack.
[02:29:59.699 --> 02:30:08.345]  And of course he blames owning property, he blames individualism, and he blames rights.
[02:30:09.460 --> 02:30:11.741]  It's true that those things could be exaggerated, right?
[02:30:11.761 --> 02:30:28.069]  We might have a situation where we're overly individualistic and, you know, we say, screw everybody else, you know, you know, some kind of crazy, I don't know, John Galt situation where we're just going to let everything go to go to heck, to crap and have a breakaway civilization, right?
[02:30:28.089 --> 02:30:29.469]  That's one side of the dialectic.
[02:30:29.529 --> 02:30:36.412]  And then the other side of the Ayn Rand John Galt dialectic is the other people like Friedolf Capra who pretend to be the opposite.
[02:30:36.592 --> 02:30:38.886]   Oh, no, no, it's not about The individual.
[02:30:38.946 --> 02:30:40.127]  It's about the collective.
[02:30:40.167 --> 02:30:41.208]  We all need to be one.
[02:30:41.448 --> 02:30:43.289]  We're all truly, deep down, just one.
[02:30:43.829 --> 02:30:47.111]  You need to dissolve your identity as an individual into the one.
[02:30:47.331 --> 02:30:52.794]  Now, in Christianity, again, I think why they have such a problem with this system, there's a balance between the one and the many.
[02:30:52.814 --> 02:30:54.055]  That's the doctrine of the Trinity.
[02:30:54.615 --> 02:30:55.675]  But that's a separate issue.
[02:30:55.795 --> 02:31:03.474]   going back to this, he says, no, no, no, we've been too far into individualism.
[02:31:03.474 --> 02:31:05.835]  And he says that we haven't listened to Malthus.
[02:31:05.835 --> 02:31:08.954]  He actually mentions Malthus on page 35.
[02:31:08.954 --> 02:31:13.194]   And he says that it's time to swing the pendulum back towards monism and
[02:31:13.194 --> 02:31:15.434]  realize that we're all collectivists.
[02:31:15.434 --> 02:31:21.354]   And he says that Taoist philosophy, he says Taoism, he speaks of like Chinese philosophy.
[02:31:22.555 --> 02:31:26.634]   He says Taoism, Confucianism, he says these can be things that will enlighten
[02:31:26.634 --> 02:31:34.594]   us to understand that we've been too individualistic and we need to really just dissolve ourself into the collective.
[02:31:34.602 --> 02:31:43.828]  Now another interesting book that ties directly into this, from the same power structure, is the lesser known Aldous Huxley book, Perennial Philosophy.
[02:31:45.211 --> 02:31:56.666]  And Aldous Huxley wrote this book, of course he was very important in the whole British establishment's promotion of hallucinogens prior to the LSD revolution of the 60s.
[02:31:57.267 --> 02:31:59.150]  Huxley was promoting this stuff back in the 40s and 50s.
[02:32:00.251 --> 02:32:07.437]  And it's very, very possible too that Alistair Crowley might have also played a role in this by influencing Huxley through Crowley's drug diaries.
[02:32:07.517 --> 02:32:15.443]  So if you don't know, Crowley wrote diaries of a drug fiend and this was kind of his experiences and recounting what happens to people on various drugs.
[02:32:15.943 --> 02:32:27.352]   Some people, Dr. Richard Spence theorizes as well, that that might have actually influenced Huxley to think, well, hey, why don't we weaponize the hallucinogen stuff And see if we can change culture with this.
[02:32:27.952 --> 02:32:34.394]  It ties in well with the British establishment promotion of Hindu philosophy in the Gurus and the Swamis.
[02:32:35.474 --> 02:32:36.274]  You see the connection?
[02:32:36.334 --> 02:32:37.034]  And why would that be?
[02:32:37.054 --> 02:32:42.475]  Well, the British establishment knew Hindu philosophy very well because India was a colony.
[02:32:43.456 --> 02:32:49.177]  And they had studied that caste system in depth to, you know, to manage one of their colonies.
[02:32:49.237 --> 02:33:01.517]   And what better system to promote the Darwinian social Darwin Social Darwin is philosophy of getting rid of most of the people, then the caste system.
[02:33:02.038 --> 02:33:06.768]  And by the way, if you don't know, the radical Darwinian philosophy is an ancient Hindu philosophy.
[02:33:08.277 --> 02:33:13.242]  Evolutionary philosophy is not new with Darwin or even the Greeks who had a version of this.
[02:33:13.262 --> 02:33:21.970]  It actually goes back to ancient Indian philosophy, and this is where you get the scale of being and that some people are born into a, you know, they basically have no value, this kind of a thing.
[02:33:22.410 --> 02:33:30.698]  Well, clearly that is applicable to the philosophy of the Malthusians and the British establishment, so they find that very useful.
[02:33:30.758 --> 02:33:31.839]  That's the source.
[02:33:32.659 --> 02:33:34.060]  This is the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:33.879 --> 02:33:38.718]   Hindu new age philosophies being promoted by design in the West and these
[02:33:38.718 --> 02:33:42.359]   people tell you that now he's not a Hindu but it's the same idea it's the
[02:33:42.359 --> 02:33:46.759]   same idea it's the idea of the individual merging into the big
[02:33:46.759 --> 02:33:50.918]   collective and that's exactly what this this whole book is about by Huxley right
[02:33:50.918 --> 02:33:54.759]   don't go anywhere this is the Alex Jones show I'm Jay Dyer guest host welcome back
[02:33:55.584 --> 02:33:58.406]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:33:58.926 --> 02:34:05.711]  We are talking about the fascinating book by one of the globalists, Fritjof Capra himself.
[02:34:06.571 --> 02:34:19.128]   And Fritjof is a deep ecologist, a big promoter of the Earth Charter, a big promoter of the idea that We need to have a global collectivism to solve mankind's problems.
[02:34:19.568 --> 02:34:35.625]   Now, I will say that one thing that did kind of surprise me is that he does a very thorough critique at the beginning of the book of scientism and the over-emphasis on materialism, of the rationalism of Descartes, all of which
[02:34:35.625 --> 02:34:38.005]  was pretty good, I have to admit.
[02:34:38.005 --> 02:34:41.645]   But the problem is that he then ends it by saying that, you know, what we got to get
[02:34:41.645 --> 02:34:47.485]   away from is the individual thinking that he has an existence of his own mind.
[02:34:47.485 --> 02:34:51.805]   If you don't know, Descartes, the famous Enlightenment philosopher who said, "Cogito ergo sum,"
[02:34:51.805 --> 02:34:53.206]  I think, therefore I am.
[02:34:53.206 --> 02:34:57.846]   And he says that's probably the root issue in Western thought since the Enlightenment
[02:34:57.846 --> 02:35:02.006]   is the idea of the individual kind of being the starting point.
[02:35:02.006 --> 02:35:05.446]   Now I don't agree with Descartes exactly, but I do think there are individuals, and
[02:35:05.446 --> 02:35:07.786]  I do think we have individual rights.
[02:35:07.786 --> 02:35:12.286]   And so my problem isn't with that, but rather that the solution is...
[02:35:12.242 --> 02:35:12.782]  Is the problem.
[02:35:12.802 --> 02:35:17.665]  And a lot of the Global Elite books, when you read them, you'll notice they actually identify quite a few legitimate problems.
[02:35:18.606 --> 02:35:24.029]  So the problem with their books isn't identifying problems, it's their horrible solutions.
[02:35:24.129 --> 02:35:35.296]  They always identify real problems, and a lot of times they've started those problems, right?
[02:35:35.897 --> 02:35:39.499]  So as he moves on to critique scientism, he says, let me give you a new paradigm.
[02:35:39.519 --> 02:35:41.140]  Let me give you a new way to look at reality.
[02:35:41.870 --> 02:35:53.999]  And he has interesting critiques of Western views of science and Newton and this kind of stuff as he moves through the next few chapters, working his way up to quantum physics.
[02:35:54.039 --> 02:35:56.961]  Now, I don't necessarily have a problem with quantum physics.
[02:35:56.981 --> 02:36:14.109]   I'm not a quantum physicist or mathematician, but just approaching it from a philosophical perspective, One of the problems I have is that a lot of times quantum physics gets co-opted and turned into political, social engineering means and mechanisms for this kind of New Age stuff, right?
[02:36:14.149 --> 02:36:20.591]  And so it ends up being a political thing telling you that, oh, by the way, quantum foam, so you don't have individual rights.
[02:36:20.691 --> 02:36:23.211]  You don't exist as an individual because of quantum foam.
[02:36:23.472 --> 02:36:24.792]  Oh, by the way, quantum physics.
[02:36:25.616 --> 02:36:30.298]  Oh, the cat in the box, and we don't know if he's alive or dead, so you don't exist as an individual, right?
[02:36:30.338 --> 02:36:53.748]  It's like all of these non-sequiturs, that doesn't follow from the fact, right, that, you know, because of some experiment that Schrodinger did, that, oh no, actually, you don't exist as an individual, and we all know what exists, and who knows, right, about anything being true or false, and so it immediately gets co-opted into Far Eastern contradictory dialectical philosophy.
[02:36:54.847 --> 02:36:59.748]  Where we can accept the contradictions, as the gurus say.
[02:37:01.449 --> 02:37:02.969]  So, where's he going with this?
[02:37:03.009 --> 02:37:09.991]  He says, let me tell you the new physics, based on quantum mechanics and all this kind of stuff, is that Gaia is alive.
[02:37:12.032 --> 02:37:20.574]  By the way, if all this contradictory stuff is true, then isn't it also both good and bad to have individual rights?
[02:37:20.754 --> 02:37:21.654]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:37:21.694 --> 02:37:25.494]   If you accept contradictions, then on the basis Is it bad?
[02:37:26.094 --> 02:37:28.415]  All the stuff in the first three chapters that he critiqued.
[02:37:29.056 --> 02:37:30.937]  Why is that bad if contradictions are true?
[02:37:30.957 --> 02:37:34.099]  If contradictions are true, nothing is good or bad.
[02:37:34.259 --> 02:37:35.119]  You see how silly this is?
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:41.083]  He says, well, biology shows us that chaos leads to order.
[02:37:41.503 --> 02:37:43.844]  Physics shows us that order leads to chaos.
[02:37:44.405 --> 02:37:48.167]  And so, actually, Newton and Darwin are both right and both wrong.
[02:37:48.427 --> 02:37:50.568]  And reality is quantum, bro.
[02:37:50.688 --> 02:37:56.755]   And if it's quantum, And everything is true and everything's false at the same time, so it turns into gibberish.
[02:37:56.955 --> 02:37:57.595]  That's the point here.
[02:37:58.116 --> 02:38:06.301]  Immediately it goes from interesting critiques to nonsensical incoherent mysticism.
[02:38:06.441 --> 02:38:07.581]  That's exactly where he takes it.
[02:38:09.323 --> 02:38:18.028]  If he can convince us of incoherent mysticism, then he kind of can step in as the guru who kind of becomes the voice of truth itself.
[02:38:18.962 --> 02:38:22.744]  So no longer is reality rational, meaningful, and coherent.
[02:38:23.244 --> 02:38:29.988]  Now it's completely irrational, and the source of meaning and coherence and truth becomes the guru himself.
[02:38:30.965 --> 02:38:38.150]  So I see Copper is kind of interjecting himself here in this point as a kind of a scientific guru, so to speak.
[02:38:38.290 --> 02:38:39.451]  It's what he's trying to do here.
[02:38:39.931 --> 02:38:51.819]  And he really thinks that he can give us a new paradigm based on the electromagnetic current, based on quantum physics, based on the matrix simulation theory.
[02:38:52.078 --> 02:38:57.119]   He goes right into simulation theory and says that because we live in a simulation, if we
[02:38:57.119 --> 02:39:05.677]  just meditate hard enough, we can figure out how to train.
[02:39:05.677 --> 02:39:12.078]   Then goes on to say that the new paradigm is going to be one that the elites will re-engineer
[02:39:12.078 --> 02:39:14.398]  through every area of society.
[02:39:15.042 --> 02:39:23.266]  Wait a minute, I thought that we were meditating to get to reality.
[02:39:23.286 --> 02:39:25.567]  I thought we were meditating on nature.
[02:39:25.687 --> 02:39:25.947]  No, no.
[02:39:26.287 --> 02:39:29.769]  Now we need a new way to approach medicine, he says.
[02:39:30.889 --> 02:39:45.512]   That kind of sounds Okay, but then he starts siding Lovelace in his medical sections, and he says that the new order of the ages, this new world order that we've been waiting for, will actually come about through medicine.
[02:39:45.532 --> 02:39:58.295]  Wow, way ahead of its time, especially given what happened the last two years with COUF, especially with transhumanist virus software men like Gil Bates suddenly telling us what medicine is.
[02:39:59.345 --> 02:40:03.147]  I mean, it's exactly what Kritoff said back in 1982.
[02:40:03.308 --> 02:40:11.252]  He says medicine will be the kind of backdoor by which the new world order, the new order of the ages would come in.
[02:40:12.053 --> 02:40:18.196]  He says that the entire social and cultural world will be transformed, changing images of men.
[02:40:19.757 --> 02:40:20.518]  And that will be key.
[02:40:20.538 --> 02:40:33.183]   And he says that one way that we'll do this is through the promotion, through psychology, Psychopharmacology of new mystical experiences.
[02:40:33.984 --> 02:40:43.896]  And he even mentions the New Age movement, LSD, and how the New Age would promote deep ecology and a new kind of religion, almost.
[02:40:44.767 --> 02:40:56.018]  Because everything that was fractured since the Enlightenment and its atomistic philosophy broken down, he says, will now be reintegrated.
[02:40:56.138 --> 02:41:04.766]  This is the alchemical process of breaking things down and then coagulating them back together in a new process, breaking down and then building back up.
[02:41:05.600 --> 02:41:06.500]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:41:06.540 --> 02:41:07.681]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:41:07.721 --> 02:41:11.142]  Jay's analysis, we're covering the book by Pritof Copra, Turning Point.
[02:41:11.662 --> 02:41:23.585]  And we were just getting to the sections where he talks about how the entire social dynamic, the entire culture will have to be transformed from the inside out via the agents of change and via the foundations that he mentions.
[02:41:23.625 --> 02:41:26.726]  By the way, he mentions the Rockefeller Foundation as cited in the book itself.
[02:41:27.458 --> 02:41:39.323]  And he says that this will come about through psychopharmacology and the medical industry, big pharma essentially, promoting the idea of mystical experiences and pharmaceuticals.
[02:41:39.383 --> 02:41:51.808]  And he says that we will continue with the counterculture revolution of the 60s and its promotion of the hallucinogenic drugs and whatnot to promote the new agenda, the new way to understand reality.
[02:41:52.368 --> 02:41:57.952]  Because everybody will see themselves as integrated and reintegrated into the collective whole.
[02:41:58.113 --> 02:42:06.699]  So he says that what Enlightenment philosophy broke down through its atomistic materialistic philosophy, he says, will now be reintegrated into the whole.
[02:42:07.440 --> 02:42:09.601]  And this is literally an alchemical process.
[02:42:09.621 --> 02:42:17.107]  So if you don't know, alchemy has the stages where you break something down and then you coagulate it, you bring it back together in the new form that you wanted.
[02:42:17.771 --> 02:42:22.354]  And that is the philosophy that the people like Rudolph Kopp are basing their system on.
[02:42:22.414 --> 02:42:35.063]  It's their operating system, their game plan, where he says that we will now reintegrate man into a new collective whole where he doesn't have any individual identity beyond what the social engineers and the elite tell them.
[02:42:35.383 --> 02:42:40.926]  The next chapter, after the medical chapter, he says that there's a dark side to growth and expansion.
[02:42:41.026 --> 02:42:43.328]  Now we've got to bring in limits to growth.
[02:42:43.368 --> 02:42:44.709]  We've got to bring in austerity.
[02:42:45.583 --> 02:42:53.349]  He says austerity and limits to growth will be basically inculcated into the masses through cultural engineering, social engineering.
[02:42:54.750 --> 02:42:56.511]  Growth must cease, he says.
[02:42:56.771 --> 02:42:59.473]  He says we have to reconcile ourselves to death.
[02:42:59.973 --> 02:43:00.674]  Death is good.
[02:43:00.734 --> 02:43:01.635]  Death is natural.
[02:43:02.015 --> 02:43:08.340]  And as soon as we realize that death is natural and we are okay with death, then we can depopulate.
[02:43:08.360 --> 02:43:10.301]  We can begin to convince people to depopulate.
[02:43:11.167 --> 02:43:17.699]  The new physics, he says, will unify all of the cultures in a holistic way so that we'll have a new world culture order.
[02:43:17.719 --> 02:43:20.364]  That's his chapter, literally.
[02:43:20.384 --> 02:43:24.331]  This whole page is on a new world order.
[02:43:26.127 --> 02:43:37.034]  The new vision of reality, and I think what really surprised me was that he actually goes into, I don't know if you guys have not seen my lecture that I did on Arthur Kessler's book, Ghost in the Machine.
[02:43:37.615 --> 02:43:39.996]  He goes into quite a bit of citations of Kessler.
[02:43:40.016 --> 02:43:46.721]  He goes into the Holons, which is this idea that Kessler had about systems in nature operating in a holistic way.
[02:43:46.761 --> 02:43:47.841]  Now there's some truth to that.
[02:43:47.901 --> 02:43:53.845]  Yeah, I mean like, you know, trees and branches and root systems, they're holistic and they connect together.
[02:43:53.905 --> 02:43:54.666]  Okay, that's fine.
[02:43:55.620 --> 02:44:08.554]  That doesn't mean that, as a human being, I need to just be viewed as a tree or an ant or, you know, a bee in the bee colony or the beehive or whatever, the ant colony, and I don't have any individual existence, right?
[02:44:08.674 --> 02:44:12.037]  Because the whole thing is assuming that I'm just an animal.
[02:44:12.178 --> 02:44:12.958]  You're just an animal.
[02:44:13.599 --> 02:44:17.183]  And so we don't have any existence that's more important than animals, according to him.
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:37.075]  He says that in order to inculcate this holistic, monistic philosophy where nobody has individual identity, and we're all just part of the one, man, is things like shamanism, shamanistic initiations, transformational festivals, things like Burning Man.
[02:44:38.183 --> 02:44:39.604]  No, I mean, I'm not approved.
[02:44:39.624 --> 02:44:41.884]  I don't think it's a big deal if you have a festival or go to a festival.
[02:44:41.904 --> 02:44:57.910]  But he's saying that festivals will be the means by which we can inculcate a new spirituality, a globalist version of spirituality, where people will focus on holism to the exclusion of individual identity.
[02:44:58.570 --> 02:45:10.050]   Again, the very thing that Mega social engineer Aldous Huxley, brother of Julian Huxley who wrote UNESCO's philosophy, philosophy of UNESCO, which is all about a new one world order.
[02:45:10.290 --> 02:45:13.254]  A new one world order requires a one world religion.
[02:45:14.756 --> 02:45:18.901]  Shamanism, Burning Man, integrate yourself into the whole bro.
[02:45:21.075 --> 02:45:22.396]  We're all one, man.
[02:45:22.956 --> 02:45:24.957]  That's exactly what he's talking about.
[02:45:24.977 --> 02:45:31.079]  And the most surprising section of the book, I couldn't believe this, was where he goes into citing the MKUltra Doctors.
[02:45:32.180 --> 02:45:36.962]  Not in a bad way, but like, we need a list of these MKUltra Doctors because they figured it out.
[02:45:37.685 --> 02:45:45.789]  What this proves, this book proves to us, is that the MKUltra doctors, their research was not just about individuals.
[02:45:45.889 --> 02:45:52.553]  It actually was about large-scale social engineering, getting people to buy into this collectivist delusion.
[02:45:52.573 --> 02:46:06.180]  And he says that we need a list of people like Dr. Gregory Bateson, who is famous as an MKUltra doctor, who said we need to capture mankind's imagination, not just his rational mind, but also his imagination to really control him.
[02:46:06.949 --> 02:46:22.759]  Well, Friedhoff Copper says that we need to inculcate mystical practices, all of these initiations, this is the craziest part, he says that we need to take the research of these doctors, these in-culture doctors, we need to have a mass initiation of the masses.
[02:46:23.359 --> 02:46:24.540]  Mass initiation of the masses.
[02:46:26.061 --> 02:46:45.975]   And he says that even studies in dissociation, that's mind control schizo stuff, He says initiation ceremonies and what we've learned in the research of MPD, DID, the research into psychosis, the research into LSD, there's a whole chapter on this, and psychedelics.
[02:46:45.995 --> 02:46:48.737]  He says when those are on a mass scale promoted everybody.
[02:46:48.797 --> 02:46:56.323]  Now, I'm not really talking about here what the hippie culture does with, you know, getting LSD and this kind of stuff.
[02:46:56.343 --> 02:46:58.745]  That was just like the old version of what they were studying.
[02:46:59.375 --> 02:47:03.056]  And they gave out a lot of that, you know, through Tim Leary, the CIA asset back in the 60s.
[02:47:03.096 --> 02:47:07.238]  But this is more so what the big pharmaceutical companies are up to.
[02:47:07.698 --> 02:47:09.458]  That's the real drugging of the population.
[02:47:09.878 --> 02:47:11.979]  Not so much the people smoking weed and the hippies.
[02:47:12.759 --> 02:47:23.943]  The real drugging of the population is the big pharmaceutical companies mandating now, oh, now you have to get these drug shots, these kinds of things, right?
[02:47:24.523 --> 02:47:27.024]  And I mean, the mRNA stuff, that's just another version of this.
[02:47:28.098 --> 02:47:33.064]  No, I mean, I know that's not a psychedelic, but that's attempting to change your very DNA and biology.
[02:47:33.865 --> 02:47:41.754]  And what Frito Capricorn is talking about is him changing your mental processes through the psychedelics, right?
[02:47:44.053 --> 02:47:45.154]  And I'm not trying to be a pruder.
[02:47:45.194 --> 02:47:50.079]  Again, there may be a legitimate use of psychedelics in medical situations.
[02:47:50.159 --> 02:47:51.480]  I don't have any hard opinions on that.
[02:47:51.500 --> 02:47:53.222]  I'm not saying that it's all bad, right?
[02:47:53.262 --> 02:47:54.563]  I mean, God gave us these things.
[02:47:54.923 --> 02:48:01.930]  There might be medical situations where people in extreme cases... I had a friend who was a severe alcoholic.
[02:48:03.092 --> 02:48:08.977]  And it was discussed at one point, maybe he should go try out one of these things where people do, you know, peyote or something.
[02:48:09.317 --> 02:48:15.643]  I'm not saying that, I mean, in an extreme case, maybe, maybe that's something that nothing else seemed to work for that guy.
[02:48:16.824 --> 02:48:26.712]  But to promote this to the masses through the top down, you know, pharmaceutical thing, that to me doesn't sound like a good idea.
[02:48:26.752 --> 02:48:29.274]  That sounds like social engineering.
[02:48:29.334 --> 02:48:31.276]  And that's exactly what Frito says.
[02:48:32.037 --> 02:48:34.379]  I keep calling him all these, he's a ridiculous name, right?
[02:48:34.399 --> 02:48:39.041]  But if you listen to him, he sounds like a, like a, like, he sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger with, uh, helium, right?
[02:48:39.081 --> 02:48:47.147]  If you listen to a dog that's, uh, he sounds, he talks like this, with a high pitched Arnold, with a little gate, and his teeth is in his asses.
[02:48:48.788 --> 02:48:49.188]  Oh yeah!
[02:48:51.042 --> 02:48:54.464]  I even end the book by saying that we need to bring in goddess worship.
[02:48:54.825 --> 02:48:55.825]  That was kind of surprising.
[02:48:55.925 --> 02:48:57.887]  Oh, we've been too masculine.
[02:48:57.947 --> 02:49:05.892]  Oh, we've been too masculine in the West and we've had the dominance of masculine patriarchal thinking and we need to bring the goddess in.
[02:49:06.012 --> 02:49:07.533]  We need to bring the goddess in.
[02:49:08.894 --> 02:49:11.036]  Why are these people telling us what we need to do?
[02:49:11.236 --> 02:49:13.077]  I mean, why are we listening to these people?
[02:49:13.797 --> 02:49:16.739]  And he even goes on to talk about the 60s CIA hippie counterculture.
[02:49:16.759 --> 02:49:18.981]  He says, no, that is the future.
[02:49:19.981 --> 02:49:20.602]  That's the future.
[02:49:21.721 --> 02:49:32.327]  Again, this book shows that here's somebody from the high, high levels of the eco-green controlled movement, funded by all the biggest foundations in the world.
[02:49:32.887 --> 02:49:42.412]  Here he is saying, let me tell you the real usage of the 60s counterculture, the mass drugging of the populace, mainly through big pharma.
[02:49:42.673 --> 02:49:45.994]  Again, he's not talking about the counterculture people.
[02:49:46.094 --> 02:49:48.876]  He's saying that was the old way of testing it out.
[02:49:49.580 --> 02:49:57.829]  He's saying the big pharma medical establishment is really going to be the means by which this is inculcated to the masses.
[02:49:57.849 --> 02:49:58.770]  Okay?
[02:49:58.790 --> 02:50:01.472]  Do you see how important this is?
[02:50:03.054 --> 02:50:15.414]   And he again ends the book by citing Gregory Bateson, the famous m-culture doctor, CIA mind control, you know, all these CIA mind control people,
[02:50:15.414 --> 02:50:20.884]   they're all the source and the heart of the new age hippie stuff, not in its origins,
[02:50:20.884 --> 02:50:22.834]  but in its mass inculcation.
[02:50:23.224 --> 02:50:24.045]  You see what I'm saying here?
[02:50:24.065 --> 02:50:30.070]  So we go back 100 years, 120 years to Blavatsky, Besant, Crowley.
[02:50:30.130 --> 02:50:38.557]  Those are the kind of revolutionary figures in terms of individual thoughts about what the future would be in terms of magic and new age and this kind of stuff.
[02:50:39.078 --> 02:50:46.825]  But they didn't have enough power and following on their own until entities like the United Nations picked up the philosophy of Blavatsky.
[02:50:47.325 --> 02:50:54.332]  Through the Lucifer Publishing House, now renamed the Lucis Trust, to promote to all the world this philosophy.
[02:50:55.233 --> 02:51:01.919]  And then to pay off these people, by the big foundation money, to promote this stuff in every area of life.
[02:51:03.487 --> 02:51:06.209]  So, that's why there's gurus everywhere.
[02:51:06.249 --> 02:51:10.351]  By the way, if you want to go deeper into this, I have a lecture that goes through the whole of that book.
[02:51:10.891 --> 02:51:13.693]  I just did a lecture the other day on occult spies.
[02:51:14.013 --> 02:51:16.014]  Go to my YouTube channel, you'll see the very top video.
[02:51:16.054 --> 02:51:16.815]  Occult spies.
[02:51:16.835 --> 02:51:18.516]  I'm going to be going through gurus.
[02:51:19.476 --> 02:51:23.898]  The Oscar winners give a press conference and how to buy a sailboat.
[02:51:23.717 --> 02:51:28.157]  the creepiest gurus out there on the world stage.
[02:51:28.157 --> 02:51:32.996]   And I have a new book out that I'm taking pre-orders for, which we get into Nietzsche, we get into Dostoevsky,
[02:51:32.996 --> 02:51:33.996]  we get into all of that.
[02:51:33.996 --> 02:51:38.156]   You go to my website right there, you'll see that book there, Meta-Narratives,
[02:51:38.156 --> 02:51:40.497]  Essays in Philosophy at Jay's Analysis.
[02:51:40.497 --> 02:51:41.556]  Pre-orders!
[02:51:41.556 --> 02:51:45.637]   The Oscar winners give a press conference and how to buy a sale book.
[02:51:45.637 --> 02:51:52.997]   I guess my feeling at this point in time is maybe we need to be completely a little bit more scary
[02:51:52.997 --> 02:51:54.997]  scary for the public.
[02:51:54.589 --> 02:51:59.291]  Especially with the Delta variant, which is the heartiest and most contagious variant we've seen to date.
[02:51:59.751 --> 02:52:01.832]  We need all the protection that we can get.
[02:52:01.892 --> 02:52:03.693]  That's why the vaccines are so effective.
[02:52:04.033 --> 02:52:07.135]  This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[02:52:07.739 --> 02:52:11.721]  We've got to get them vaccinated, and hopefully they will do it willingly.
[02:52:11.741 --> 02:52:17.644]  I think we really need to make it clear that there are privileges associated with being an American.
[02:52:17.664 --> 02:52:20.205]  We have to be more calm, we have to be more forceful.
[02:52:20.546 --> 02:52:27.929]  If you do not want to get vaccinated, you can work from home, you can homeschool your children, you can shop online.
[02:52:28.309 --> 02:52:32.912]  So where is this coming from, people saying, I'm now being forced to be vaccinated?
[02:52:33.092 --> 02:52:35.093]  If you want to travel, you better go get that vaccine.
[02:52:35.293 --> 02:52:40.019]  You should be wearing masks even when you are vaccinated if you are indoors.
[02:52:40.319 --> 02:52:43.983]  If you wish to have these privileges, you need to get vaccinated.
[02:52:44.063 --> 02:52:48.749]  We have to say something coming out, you know, you don't get vaccinated, you know you're going to die.
[02:52:48.648 --> 02:52:52.769]  I mean, let's just be really blunt to these people.
[02:52:52.769 --> 02:52:54.108]  Get vaccinated.
[02:52:54.108 --> 02:52:59.689]  Get vaccinated, get vaccinated, get vaccinated.
[02:52:59.689 --> 02:53:03.189]  (airplane engine roaring)
[02:53:03.189 --> 02:53:30.468]   You've always thought you couldn't air press on nails because of all the active things you do.
[02:53:30.645 --> 02:53:32.746]  Pre-colored in seven luscious hues.
[02:53:33.466 --> 02:53:33.686]  Just...
[02:53:36.512 --> 02:53:38.915]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[02:53:39.455 --> 02:53:44.720]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[02:53:45.141 --> 02:53:49.505]  The signal's being sent through time.
[02:53:49.565 --> 02:53:51.587]  There is a war on for your mind.
[02:53:52.147 --> 02:53:55.250]  Our signal has reached more than two billion people.
[02:53:56.172 --> 02:54:01.394]  But the enemy is now aware of the fact that we've broken through and are moving to block us on every front.
[02:54:01.974 --> 02:54:10.818]  The only way you're going to be able to see our videos and articles is to visit Infowars.com itself and hand-share the videos and articles to everyone you know.
[02:54:11.378 --> 02:54:16.700]  The signal is getting through and is exposing and defeating the globalists when we're able to get it through.
[02:54:17.261 --> 02:54:22.563]  But they're admittedly expanding their operations to suppress us, so only you can boost the signal.
[02:54:23.163 --> 02:54:25.144]  Only you can defeat the globalists.
[02:54:25.464 --> 02:54:26.405]  We're in this together.
[02:54:26.846 --> 02:54:31.010]  I salute you for your work, and I ask all of you to redouble your efforts.
[02:54:31.150 --> 02:54:35.995]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are our resistance.
[02:54:36.015 --> 02:54:41.841]  The worst possible thing you could do is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually make them worse.
[02:54:45.663 --> 02:54:48.326]  mRNA is messenger RNA.
[02:54:48.506 --> 02:54:56.995]  It's a message that's being sent from your DNA to your cells, telling your cells what to do to maintain health.
[02:54:57.596 --> 02:54:59.518]  In this case, create a protein.
[02:55:00.099 --> 02:55:07.487]  Any technology that does something brand new inside of our bodies needs to be watched for years, if not decades.
[02:55:08.226 --> 02:55:12.828]  If they tell you that it's safe and effective, they're lying because we don't have the data yet.
[02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:17.991]  They need to tell you that you are part of a stage four research experiment.
[02:55:18.111 --> 02:55:19.492]  You are the lab rat.
[02:55:19.852 --> 02:55:20.992]  You are the guinea pig.
[02:55:21.252 --> 02:55:23.293]  This is a scientific dictatorship.
[02:55:23.494 --> 02:55:26.975]  This is the greatest hoax and the greatest power grab in human history.
