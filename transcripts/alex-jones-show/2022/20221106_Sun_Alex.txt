[00:00:02.791 --> 00:00:12.336]  Apple was the first company to remove Alex Jones' hateful, anti-government, conspiratorial rants from their platform.
[00:00:14.718 --> 00:00:17.179]  And other tech companies, as we know, followed their lead.
[00:00:17.379 --> 00:00:28.565]  We have the ADL that is openly the arbiter with big tech and the censors on who can be online, who can basically in the future, with a social credit score, even have a job.
[00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:32.047]  You're going to be put into ghettos and then into camps under their admitted plans.
[00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:40.790]  Whether our children will be arrested and conceivably killed, we're on the edge of a brutal authoritarian system, and it could be a week away.
[00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.351]  The head of the ADL put out a letter attacking Elon Musk, saying you will not reinstate President Trump.
[00:00:46.751 --> 00:00:48.612]  He is a danger and a terrorist.
[00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:55.714]  And they went on to say Alex Jones is the other big enemy, and he must not be allowed back on Twitter.
[00:00:56.134 --> 00:00:58.975]  Now a lot of people are saying, well, when are we going to see you back on Twitter?
[00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:01.276]  I'm not worried about trying to get back on Twitter.
[00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:07.118]  I am worried about the social credit score, the debanking that's coming for everybody in the next phase of this.
[00:01:08.018 --> 00:01:08.819]  Real tyranny.
[00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:10.419]  You talk about clear and present danger.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.283]  We're talking about the ability to track and trace and surveil upon subjects from the cradle to the grave, effectively.
[00:01:19.903 --> 00:01:30.085]   From the beginning of your life, or your children's lives, or your grandchildren's lives, they'll have biometric identity markers placed on you and connected with this
[00:01:30.085 --> 00:01:36.355]   digital ID and then all records about all activity will be associated with it.
[00:01:36.355 --> 00:01:42.484]   This is not simply some identification. This is a database that is kept in a
[00:01:42.484 --> 00:01:49.234]   centralized place by the state and then is a collection of all activities from
[00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:53.266]   the beginning of your life onward. But what you're doing going after
[00:01:53.266 --> 00:01:59.105]   President Trump and Tucker Carlson and others that are good people is discrediting the
[00:01:59.105 --> 00:02:04.224]   ADL and discrediting groups that are against
[00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.751]   anti-semitism and it's a lie. Tucker Carlson has a history of sanitizing
[00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:14.830]   stereotypes and of spreading this kind of poison. The Great Replacement Theory
[00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.430]   as it's known is this toxic idea that there are a cabal of Jews plotting to
[00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.911]   overrun the country with immigrants, Muslims, black people, etc. and commit
[00:02:26.911 --> 00:02:30.670]  what they call white genocide.
[00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:35.420]  It is literally a staple of white supremacist and extremist ideology.
[00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:47.970]  This is the Coalition of Jewish Values, rabbinic group, largest in the country, calls for CEO Greenblatt's resignation after ADL tweets minimizes the Holocaust.
[00:02:49.056 --> 00:02:53.337]  Because he said, Tucker Carlson is a Nazi, and is as bad as Hitler.
[00:02:53.737 --> 00:03:00.558]  The Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans.
[00:03:01.098 --> 00:03:03.118]  And that is a threat to this country.
[00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:09.019]  Yeah, they're a threat, says the guy with the blood-red Nazi background and Marines standing behind him.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.561]  Tucker Carlson's dangerous to tyrants, and the ADL's basically just a group of globalists for rent to go out and call anybody that's for freedom a Nazi.
[00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.051]  And this major rabbinical organization said, what you're doing is evil.
[00:03:23.972 --> 00:03:27.953]  And so the good news is here, people across the board are done with the ADL.
[00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:33.235]  The bad news is the Anti-Defamation League is completely globalist, completely leftist.
[00:03:34.455 --> 00:03:43.945]   It defends radical Islam while attacking basic American values and attacking Christians And creating dissension, but that's what the left does.
[00:03:43.965 --> 00:03:52.701]  It's just preposterous that a former president, who had the election stolen from him, was taken off Twitter when he said peacefully march the Capitol.
[00:03:53.496 --> 00:03:59.019]  And the left had provocateurs there, and then they falsely claimed that Trump ordered people to attack the Capitol.
[00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.279]  That's a fraud!
[00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:04.301]  Who died and made the ADL our controllers?
[00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:07.322]  The greatest propaganda machine in history.
[00:04:07.362 --> 00:04:08.083]  Let's think about it.
[00:04:08.243 --> 00:04:11.384]  Facebook, YouTube, and Google, Twitter, and others.
[00:04:11.864 --> 00:04:13.665]  They reach billions of people.
[00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:21.309]  The algorithms these platforms depend on deliberately amplify the type of content that keeps users engaged.
[00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:27.252]  Stories that appeal to our baser instincts and that trigger outrage and fear.
[00:04:27.712 --> 00:04:34.736]  It's why YouTube recommended videos by the conspiracist Alex Jones billions of times.
[00:04:35.516 --> 00:04:51.045]  Because the closest thing I've seen to Nazis in America is the left and the ADL and the Southern Poverty Law Center and their vaccine passports and their lockdowns and their bullying that violates the Nuremberg Code trying to make us take experimental shots.
[00:04:52.526 --> 00:04:58.770]  And the social credit score that'll take your bank account and your job if they don't agree with your political views, that's already happening?
[00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.413]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:05:04.992 --> 00:05:11.992]   Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:05:11.992 --> 00:05:24.992]   Despite all the globalist efforts, thanks to you, the viewers and listeners of this broadcast, we're still on air.
[00:05:25.869 --> 00:05:33.315]  Now we're only 37 hours from the incredibly historic official day of this midterm.
[00:05:33.355 --> 00:05:37.018]  We'll be here Tuesday right through midnight, two o'clock, three o'clock.
[00:05:37.038 --> 00:05:39.319]  It's lovely to be here tracking this.
[00:05:40.327 --> 00:05:57.080]  The Deep State has promised that they are going to manipulate things, of course, and are saying that in key battleground states, it'll stay open for days because they've got to count all the special ballots they've got rattled and ready to try to steal things like last time.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:05.646]  But it's very hard for them to beat a massive red tsunami because they're using the names of dead people and folks that have moved out of the districts.
[00:06:05.706 --> 00:06:07.988]  But I'm going to get to that coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:06:08.897 --> 00:06:19.945]  There is a big report out, the big election watch state commission in Pennsylvania that has the database of who real voters are so they can find out what real votes are that was put in a few years ago.
[00:06:20.506 --> 00:06:31.154]  It just went offline and failed and so they'll be able to try to carry out their fraud and prop up the creature, the ghoul, Fetterman.
[00:06:31.234 --> 00:06:35.183]   So we're going to be tracking All of that coming up.
[00:06:35.363 --> 00:06:41.907]  But I wanted first today to just really let something seek in here.
[00:06:42.107 --> 00:06:45.709]  Because if we don't understand this, we're not going to understand anything.
[00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:49.491]  There is a planetary world government being established.
[00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:50.372]  It's now out in the open.
[00:06:51.713 --> 00:07:02.499]  And if we can simply identify that this is happening, understand the tactics they're using, try to stop debate about it, the system will not be able to carry out its criminal activity.
[00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:31.247]  And I've harped on this and I've harped on this critical issue that we need to get good leaders around the world, which is starting to happen at an accelerated rate, to identify the New World Order and the private corporate fascist model through the Davos Group and the UN, allied with Communist China, so that the general population realizes the direct control they have over most governments and over policy to carry out these very hellish, hellscape-type operations.
[00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.732]  Now, over the years, the Deep State, run by Obama and other globalists, will do yearly polls.
[00:07:38.392 --> 00:07:43.214]  And they'll ask the public what percentage of them think secret cabals run the government.
[00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:45.635]  These aren't secret cabals anymore.
[00:07:45.655 --> 00:07:47.456]  They're out in the open running things.
[00:07:47.956 --> 00:07:52.138]  Lauschwab, we penetrate the cabinets, we control half the governments in the world.
[00:07:52.158 --> 00:07:53.659]  Our agenda is here.
[00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.679]  We will take the property from you and control you.
[00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:57.380]  We own your body now.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.581]  The future is not human.
[00:07:59.601 --> 00:08:01.702]  I mean, these are all real quotes.
[00:08:03.604 --> 00:08:05.525]  Not just from him, but this entire cult.
[00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:08.027]  And so there's a new poll out.
[00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:10.868]  Jamie White wrote about it at Infowars.com.
[00:08:11.509 --> 00:08:12.309]  Shock poll.
[00:08:12.469 --> 00:08:17.212]  Nearly half of voters believe secret cabal controls the U.S.
[00:08:17.272 --> 00:08:17.673]  government.
[00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:19.654]  And who ran the poll?
[00:08:20.947 --> 00:08:26.987]   It's a poll of likely voters. Half of U.S. voters believe the federal government is controlled by a secret cabal,
[00:08:26.987 --> 00:08:27.947]  according to the poll.
[00:08:27.947 --> 00:08:37.106]   The Benenson Strategy Group, headed by Obama campaign bolster Joel Benenson, surveyed 1,000 Americans between October 27th
[00:08:37.106 --> 00:08:41.947]   and 30th to see how much they were influenced by QAnon.
[00:08:41.947 --> 00:08:46.947]   They call anybody that questions the new world order world government QAnon
[00:08:46.947 --> 00:08:50.947]   because that's a nebulous group that puts out a lot of disinfo and some real info
[00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:53.947]  so they can act like only QAnon people are saying this.
[00:08:53.947 --> 00:09:03.947]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:59.649]  We wanted to test QAnon's language, but the world's controlled by a secret cabal.
[00:08:59.669 --> 00:09:08.235]  So they're saying QAnon, not JFK questions secret societies, or not Ronald Reagan, or not Alex Jones, or not Ron Paul.
[00:09:09.435 --> 00:09:16.881]  Or not the actual quotes these people know, just say, QAnon owns that real estate, which is some nebulous group itself filled with globalist operatives.
[00:09:17.762 --> 00:09:21.705]  We wanted to test QAnon's language, the world's controlled by a secret cabal, he said.
[00:09:22.325 --> 00:09:23.146]  Given that the U.S.
[00:09:23.326 --> 00:09:28.390]  is the world's strongest democracy, we wanted to see how far the appeal of language like this might reach.
[00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:28.870]  The results?
[00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:31.492]  44% of respondents believe the U.S.
[00:09:31.512 --> 00:09:33.794]  government is controlled by a secret cabal.
[00:09:35.235 --> 00:09:36.416]  Now here's what's really important.
[00:09:37.816 --> 00:09:39.017]  Here's the actual poll.
[00:09:39.357 --> 00:09:42.800]  Share of voters who say they think the federal government is controlled by Sears-Gamal.
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.540]  The total, 44%.
[00:09:45.902 --> 00:09:47.143]  By party, Republicans, 53%.
[00:09:47.263 --> 00:09:49.945]  Independent, 41.
[00:09:51.005 --> 00:09:52.166]  Democrat, 37.
[00:09:56.569 --> 00:09:58.811]  So, this is how this has worked.
[00:09:58.831 --> 00:09:59.691]  This is so important.
[00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:00.472]  Listen to me carefully.
[00:10:01.032 --> 00:10:04.175]  An even more important issue will be covered in the next segment.
[00:10:04.495 --> 00:10:05.576]  This cannot get more important.
[00:10:06.036 --> 00:10:07.337]  Here's how the gaslighting works.
[00:10:08.663 --> 00:10:33.296]  For decades, if you look at UN treaties and open plans going back to the 60s, to have the United Nations take over every major government's systems, basically establish a corporate world dictatorship, they would then have the New York Times, the Washington Post, ABC News, back in the time, CBS News, attack those people and say they were insane it didn't exist, even though it was officially in the treaties and in the plans.
[00:10:34.476 --> 00:10:43.285]   Kind of like we have a 1979 weather control treaty, The Department of Energy admits since the early 90s they've been spraying aluminum dioxide and barium salts in the air to manipulate weather.
[00:10:44.165 --> 00:10:46.526]  When you talk about it, they just say you're crazy.
[00:10:46.586 --> 00:10:54.287]  Even though it's on C-SPAN at CIA hearings and it's in all the documents, the Department of Energy spends $5 billion a year on it, at least.
[00:10:55.467 --> 00:10:59.188]  They try to silence and shut down the voices that actually give you the details.
[00:10:59.848 --> 00:11:02.189]  That's public, but they don't want to debate about it.
[00:11:02.589 --> 00:11:03.949]  So they go ahead with the agenda.
[00:11:05.424 --> 00:11:09.185]  Just like human-animal cloning across species has been going on for at least 30 years.
[00:11:09.305 --> 00:11:09.825]  It's admitted.
[00:11:10.465 --> 00:11:12.026]  But I would talk about it 25 years ago.
[00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:14.086]  People say, you're crazy, there aren't human-animal clones.
[00:11:14.526 --> 00:11:18.487]  Now they come out in the news the last five years and go, yeah, we've been making human-animal clones for a long time.
[00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.468]  We harvest the organs in medical experiments.
[00:11:20.788 --> 00:11:23.668]  We've done them in secret bases, but you're not allowed to see them.
[00:11:23.828 --> 00:11:24.749]  That's mainstream news now.
[00:11:26.209 --> 00:11:26.409]  See?
[00:11:26.869 --> 00:11:29.790]  Because they didn't want to debate for me while they perfected whatever it is.
[00:11:31.227 --> 00:11:32.008]  They're really up to.
[00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:34.169]  So, it's the same tactic.
[00:11:34.209 --> 00:11:47.396]  You talk about world government run by corporate interests, and you quote the UN and Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates, and the Financial Times of London, a few years ago, had a headline saying, yeah, world government's good, we're going to carry it out, and it's going to be authoritarian for your own good.
[00:11:49.157 --> 00:11:58.422]  Then the very same Financial Times of London, just one example, a week later ran a headline saying, arrest anybody, basically, or censor people that say there's a corporate and one world government being formed.
[00:11:59.204 --> 00:12:14.054]  So it's okay to promote world government, support world government, support the tyranny, support forced inoculation, but then when you criticize it, they go, whoa, whoa, whoa, there's no new world order, or there's no forced inoculation, or there's no inflation.
[00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:21.439]  We've now got a bunch of the different corporate mouthpieces, we'll play the clips coming up, saying there is no such thing as inflation.
[00:12:21.879 --> 00:12:24.601]  It's a word invented by Republicans to scare you.
[00:12:26.459 --> 00:12:30.102]  Well, all inflation is is prices exploding, devaluation of currency.
[00:12:31.163 --> 00:12:33.425]  So that's the level of gaslighting here.
[00:12:34.586 --> 00:12:40.331]  But it was 5% of the colonies that initiated the Revolutionary War in 1775, 1776.
[00:12:40.391 --> 00:12:41.932]  And it was maybe 15, 20% won the war.
[00:12:41.751 --> 00:12:51.591]   1776 and it was maybe 15-20 percent won the war. If we've got 44 percent of
[00:12:51.591 --> 00:12:57.810]   Americans even in Obama's own deep state poll that know a shadow
[00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:02.810]   government runs things that's now emerging taking the mask off, it's game
[00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:08.971]   over for these guys. That's a very important article by Jamie White.
[00:13:07.136 --> 00:13:08.017]  So good job, everybody.
[00:13:08.757 --> 00:13:16.961]  Whether you're in Brazil or whether you're in Sweden or Germany or France or England or Russia or South Africa or Nigeria or Japan.
[00:13:18.598 --> 00:13:34.709]  The hottest thing is people discovering the WEF and the UN control of their countries and now it's all over the news that Twitter and Facebook and all of them were interfacing on a minute-by-minute basis with the UN and their censorship board on who to control, working with the Democratic Party and the CIA and FBI illegally.
[00:13:35.109 --> 00:13:36.690]  Those documents came out a week and a half ago.
[00:13:38.811 --> 00:13:41.533]  That Twitter was under direct UN command.
[00:13:41.553 --> 00:13:44.915]  It's all coming out.
[00:13:46.636 --> 00:13:59.299]   Ladies and gentlemen, And so once the people figure this out, and that their pain, and the inflation, and the crime, and the destruction is caused by the New World Order, it's game over.
[00:13:59.379 --> 00:14:09.506]  But they want to make it where it's a no-no, not kosher, from a side of Nangrata, a scarlet letter if you talk about the globalist, the New World Order.
[00:14:10.796 --> 00:14:13.900]  So they're simultaneously announcing it, trying to mainline it and normalize it.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:14.500]  You're under U.N.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.004]  control with corporations running the planet ruthlessly for depopulation.
[00:14:18.465 --> 00:14:19.806]  You'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll like it.
[00:14:20.748 --> 00:14:25.071]  Well, at the same time you talk about it, shut up, we're going to deplatform you and put you in jail, because that doesn't exist.
[00:14:25.451 --> 00:14:35.378]  David Icke was about to give a speech in Amsterdam to 50,000 people, and David said, you're a level three terrorist, officially, you can't come to Europe, we'll arrest you, because you say there's a secret government.
[00:14:35.978 --> 00:14:36.519]  Well, guess what?
[00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:39.881]  You already failed, you monsters, and you're going to go to prison.
[00:14:40.201 --> 00:14:41.342]  It's only a matter of time.
[00:14:41.662 --> 00:14:50.260]   Now, the bigger news, the big news, the unbelievable genocide news, You'll want to stay with us.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.221]  Everybody, you know, tune in now.
[00:14:55.342 --> 00:14:57.063]  Welcome back to what they don't want you to know.
[00:14:58.103 --> 00:15:02.265]  Despite the establishment's most wicked attempts, we are still here.
[00:15:02.745 --> 00:15:04.026]  Defiance to their tyranny.
[00:15:04.046 --> 00:15:12.669]  By the grace of God and your energy spreading the word about InfoWars.com and Band Out video on our local stations across the United States.
[00:15:13.929 --> 00:15:14.750]  You are the resistance.
[00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.231]  You are the strength for this operation, viewers and listeners.
[00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:18.091]  Don't forget that ever.
[00:15:18.945 --> 00:15:22.086]  The children are counting on you and our entire future is in your hands.
[00:15:23.447 --> 00:15:28.289]  All right, look, we've known this for about a year and a half since the deadly injection started, almost two years.
[00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:43.355]  Because of the fine print, the CDC said in October of 2000, they'd already secretly tested these MRNA shots before, and that's now come out on other COVID category diseases on humans and animals.
[00:15:43.895 --> 00:15:50.005]   It was going to cause myocarditis, heart attacks, blood clots, infertility, stillbirths, Spontaneous abortions.
[00:15:50.045 --> 00:15:51.026]  The list goes on and on.
[00:15:51.566 --> 00:16:11.532]  And so now there's a big article up on InfoWars.com tonight by the intrepid and prolific Jamie White that links directly to the German government, the Swedish government, and the United States government.
[00:16:14.423 --> 00:16:18.765]  Now remember what came out a year ago in the New England Journal of Medicine.
[00:16:20.125 --> 00:16:37.592]  In the first and second trimester, of more than 10,000 pregnant women they tracked in the study, 82% had miscarriages, when usually about 3% of women have miscarriages, in the first and second trimesters.
[00:16:38.894 --> 00:16:42.076]  So, they're only counting it as stillbirths in the third trimester.
[00:16:42.096 --> 00:16:44.158]  So remember, that number is much higher.
[00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:53.204]  It was a little under 15% of the women having the miscarriages in the third trimester.
[00:16:53.264 --> 00:16:56.366]  This is very tailored to go under the radar.
[00:16:57.747 --> 00:16:59.668]  It kills 82% of the babies.
[00:17:00.328 --> 00:17:01.429]  Remember that there's too many of us.
[00:17:01.529 --> 00:17:05.752]  The same people that want us to take the shots and say they love us, tell us there's too many of us, they want to get rid of us.
[00:17:07.475 --> 00:17:13.879]  And they're hitting who they see as using the most resources, the Western worlds, where they hit us with the Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and J&J.
[00:17:14.179 --> 00:17:14.940]  They all do the same thing.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:27.147]  They create folding protein systems similar to spongiform encephalopathy, or what causes mad cow disease, spongiform encephalopathy, prions.
[00:17:27.187 --> 00:17:29.609]  And I had Dr. Peter McCullough in studio for two hours yesterday.
[00:17:29.649 --> 00:17:31.070]  That's now archived at Bandot Video.
[00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:31.930]  He talked a lot about that.
[00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:32.571]  We showed the studies.
[00:17:35.469 --> 00:17:36.550]  It colonizes your body.
[00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:44.838]  It migrates to areas that have a lot of cellular change going on, like the ovaries, like the testicles, like the breast.
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.121]  Those are the most hormonal areas of the body.
[00:17:48.141 --> 00:17:52.005]  They go to the most interchange with the platelets of the body.
[00:17:52.445 --> 00:18:00.073]  But even separate with platelets being in the area, the so-called vaccine creates a nanotech formation in your body.
[00:18:02.941 --> 00:18:08.324]  Of self-replicating folding nanotech prion crystals.
[00:18:08.965 --> 00:18:13.167]  That's what coroners and pathologists are reporting everywhere that they've given the shots.
[00:18:13.667 --> 00:18:18.490]  Where they don't take these shots, in China and Russia and hundreds of other countries, they have no problem.
[00:18:20.111 --> 00:18:38.953]   Everywhere they do take the shots, where the Pentagon through Bill and Melinda Gates gave the directives, In the years before the release of COVID to develop these exact same plans viral vector vaccines and mRNA gene therapy so-called vaccines.
[00:18:39.413 --> 00:18:45.377]  So it's all to order directed by the UN and the Pentagon and even Dr. McCullough broke this down wrote an article about it.
[00:18:45.998 --> 00:18:46.638]  We'll be getting to.
[00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:52.702]  I think the troops are on your side the average person military is a great person but the people that run our military are the globalists.
[00:18:53.603 --> 00:18:56.245]  This is a world government UN Pentagon directed operation.
[00:18:58.197 --> 00:19:14.609]  And so the German government looks at the last hundred plus years of statistics and this is a higher stillbirth and death rate in children than when five million Russian troops were invading Germany in 1945.
[00:19:18.376 --> 00:19:23.460]  Now, to put that in perspective, the Russians killed 20 million Germans in World War II.
[00:19:24.081 --> 00:19:25.181]  That's a third of the population.
[00:19:25.422 --> 00:19:25.762]  Look it up.
[00:19:26.703 --> 00:19:30.626]  The Germans killed 22 million Russians conservatively.
[00:19:30.646 --> 00:19:34.128]  About a third of them, or 25% of them.
[00:19:34.769 --> 00:19:35.610]  Side issue, sorry.
[00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.352]  So this is bigger than World War II for our children.
[00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:43.854]  COVID vaccines linked to plummeting fertility rate, German study finds.
[00:19:43.894 --> 00:19:54.786]  An alarming study of the German reveals a strong association between the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the sudden dramatic drop in fertility rates in Germany and Sweden and Stilberts, according to the German federal...
[00:19:55.607 --> 00:19:57.849]  Institute for population research.
[00:19:57.869 --> 00:20:08.876]  There is a strong association between the onset of vaccination programs and the fertility decline nine months after it says this is not connected to COVID and not connected to anything in the economy.
[00:20:08.996 --> 00:20:09.897]  It is the shot.
[00:20:10.857 --> 00:20:12.819]  They found is the causal effect.
[00:20:12.859 --> 00:20:15.400]  You might want to actually look at those statistics.
[00:20:16.281 --> 00:20:17.922]  Here is Germany.
[00:20:19.503 --> 00:20:20.604]  It's very interesting.
[00:20:20.644 --> 00:20:21.645]  We've got Sweden.
[00:20:24.386 --> 00:20:25.127]  Sweden right here.
[00:20:28.092 --> 00:20:32.694]  Had basically the same rollout as Germany and they have almost the exact same graph.
[00:20:34.655 --> 00:20:35.356]  So here you see 2000, 2002, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12.
[00:20:37.937 --> 00:20:42.839]  And it goes back 100 years.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.381]  And then boom, the injections begin.
[00:20:48.102 --> 00:20:51.663]  At the end of 2020 and looky there, what happens?
[00:20:53.304 --> 00:20:57.006]  The exact same basic graph in Sweden.
[00:20:58.351 --> 00:20:59.292]  And in Germany.
[00:21:03.115 --> 00:21:08.720]  And then as soon as people get smart, after the first year and stop taking it, it reverses itself.
[00:21:11.142 --> 00:21:15.105]  But not back to the levels it was, only goes back up a third of where it was.
[00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:22.051]  Now, let me show you the stillbirth logs.
[00:21:22.451 --> 00:21:23.772]  They're exactly the same.
[00:21:24.273 --> 00:21:25.374]  Oh, but that's just Sweden.
[00:21:26.823 --> 00:21:27.904]  That's just Germany.
[00:21:29.264 --> 00:21:29.304]  Oh!
[00:21:30.265 --> 00:21:33.247]  We have the VAERS reporting system here in the United States.
[00:21:34.727 --> 00:21:37.249]  And here's what it shows for miscarriages of stillbirths.
[00:21:37.649 --> 00:21:39.070]  Look at all these years.
[00:21:40.171 --> 00:21:41.251]  This one goes back to 1990.
[00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:41.952]  32 years ago.
[00:21:41.771 --> 00:22:00.451]   1990, 32 years ago, and it is 3,500 plus percent. I guess that's 3, that's 36, 3,700 times
[00:22:00.649 --> 00:22:04.751]  So 3,650% increase exactly at the start of 2021 when the shots start in the United States.
[00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:12.250]   increase exactly at the start of 2021 when the shots start in the United States.
[00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:24.409]   Exactly a 3,600 plus percent increase in miscarriages and stillbirths. People get
[00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:29.211]  wise, the poison shot uptake dramatically drops.
[00:22:28.438 --> 00:22:34.120]  But still, those people are pretty much permanently disabled and probably will never be able to have children.
[00:22:37.562 --> 00:22:42.684]  But now, some of the folks start having children again and it bounces back about a third.
[00:22:43.924 --> 00:22:46.685]  A little more than a third, just like Germany and Sweden.
[00:22:46.985 --> 00:22:47.946]  The exact same graph.
[00:22:52.648 --> 00:22:52.828]  So!
[00:22:55.814 --> 00:22:56.474]  Guess what?
[00:22:56.554 --> 00:22:58.295]  I've got Australia too!
[00:22:58.616 --> 00:22:59.976]  Oh ho ho!
[00:23:00.597 --> 00:23:03.058]  And I've got New Zealand and I've got the UK.
[00:23:03.098 --> 00:23:03.638]  And guess what?
[00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:08.121]  They're even worse because they took it up at a higher level.
[00:23:08.161 --> 00:23:09.582]  They were good little citizens.
[00:23:10.602 --> 00:23:13.864]  And after all, the public's that dumb and believes murdering criminals like this?
[00:23:14.485 --> 00:23:16.086]  Should they really be having children?
[00:23:16.506 --> 00:23:18.367]  You know, I'm starting to like Bill Gates.
[00:23:19.327 --> 00:23:21.889]  It's the left that did all this and they're not going to be having children.
[00:23:22.309 --> 00:23:23.490]  See, I'm not evil, so I don't agree with that.
[00:23:24.696 --> 00:23:26.697]  I mean, they do like to be murdered.
[00:23:26.737 --> 00:23:28.038]  They do like to have their children die.
[00:23:28.098 --> 00:23:30.078]  And don't worry, they're going to.
[00:23:32.219 --> 00:23:33.300]  Oh, it's so liberal.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.100]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:35.861 --> 00:23:44.665]  Please don't forget, we're going to have live coverage kicking off Tuesday morning, 8 a.m., right through past midnight.
[00:23:45.004 --> 00:23:50.763]   of these incredibly important midterms and all the obvious chicanery that has already begun there.
[00:23:50.763 --> 00:24:02.843]   Now let's go ahead and get back into what I was just covering.
[00:24:03.103 --> 00:24:06.264]  You can say, hey, it's the leftists that are taking these poison shots.
[00:24:07.264 --> 00:24:08.725]  So who cares if they all kill themselves?
[00:24:08.745 --> 00:24:11.026]  Well, I actually morally do, because most of them aren't that evil.
[00:24:11.406 --> 00:24:12.146]  They're just misled.
[00:24:12.226 --> 00:24:14.367]  Plus, they're going after the children.
[00:24:14.407 --> 00:24:18.148]  No country's going after children like the United States, hijacked by the New World Order.
[00:24:18.888 --> 00:24:19.869]  Six-month-olds and up.
[00:24:20.592 --> 00:24:24.534]  The FDA and federal government's trying to make it mandatory in schools.
[00:24:25.155 --> 00:24:26.515]  So they're coming after our children.
[00:24:26.575 --> 00:24:29.557]  Our children cannot make these conscious decisions.
[00:24:30.117 --> 00:24:31.238]  They can't join the military.
[00:24:31.278 --> 00:24:32.539]  They can't buy a pack of cigarettes.
[00:24:32.939 --> 00:24:34.160]  They can't buy a bottle of liquor.
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:39.022]  And they shouldn't be able to take these poison shots.
[00:24:39.963 --> 00:24:42.164]  If their evil parents want to take it, they should take it.
[00:24:42.264 --> 00:24:47.350]   And it's definitely a Colt thing with them to prove that they're part of the system.
[00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:51.793]  But if you just joined us, Sweden and Germany have basically the exact same numbers with the US.
[00:24:53.274 --> 00:24:59.178]  And you can follow the higher the rate of taking the shots, the higher the rate of miscarriages and stillbirths.
[00:24:59.218 --> 00:25:00.499]  Same thing with Israel.
[00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:04.321]  It all starts right when the countries start the injections.
[00:25:04.802 --> 00:25:06.963]  England started the shots first in late 2020.
[00:25:07.223 --> 00:25:08.264]  So it started there first.
[00:25:08.664 --> 00:25:09.885]  Everywhere else, it started in 2021.
[00:25:10.385 --> 00:25:12.727]  And you see the numbers explode after that.
[00:25:13.513 --> 00:25:15.994]  Pretty shocking information.
[00:25:18.494 --> 00:25:20.815]  Now, that leads us to this next big point.
[00:25:22.195 --> 00:25:26.937]  We have an InfoWars.com poll in the middle of the right-hand side of the page.
[00:25:27.037 --> 00:25:31.978]  Are you willing to forgive the establishment for forcing COVID tyranny upon you for two years?
[00:25:33.378 --> 00:25:34.959]  2% have Stockholm Syndrome and said yes.
[00:25:36.678 --> 00:25:39.678]  No was 31%.
[00:25:39.678 --> 00:25:46.318]  That was Sunday.
[00:25:46.318 --> 00:25:56.318]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:25:47.702 --> 00:25:50.723]  And we have no Nuremberg 2.0 trials.
[00:25:50.743 --> 00:25:50.723]  66%.
[00:25:51.744 --> 00:25:54.945]  So let me read that again.
[00:25:55.325 --> 00:25:55.846]  Yes, said 2%.
[00:25:58.357 --> 00:25:59.458]  No was 31.
[00:26:00.098 --> 00:26:02.460]  So yes, 2% said they'll forgive the system.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.521]  No was 31%.
[00:26:05.121 --> 00:26:05.722]  Someday was 1%.
[00:26:06.922 --> 00:26:11.205]  And no, Nuremberg war crime trials 2.0, 66%.
[00:26:12.386 --> 00:26:13.386]  And that really should be 100%.
[00:26:13.426 --> 00:26:17.929]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:21.091]  So that leads me now to this story that's been out for a week and a half.
[00:26:21.151 --> 00:26:22.152]  It's been so huge.
[00:26:22.532 --> 00:26:25.474]  It's really got people's attention and got them thinking and angry.
[00:26:26.249 --> 00:26:31.891]  The Atlantic came out, which is the mouthpiece of the New World Order, and said, OK, we made some mistakes.
[00:26:31.931 --> 00:26:34.492]  We're sorry the shot doesn't work, but we still want to make you take it.
[00:26:34.892 --> 00:26:37.233]  And we locked you down and hurt kids and the masks don't work.
[00:26:37.313 --> 00:26:39.554]  And we want an amnesty.
[00:26:39.614 --> 00:26:42.915]  Just forgive us, because they see the political worldwide movement that's built.
[00:26:42.995 --> 00:26:43.795]  It's not going away.
[00:26:43.835 --> 00:26:44.575]  We're not forgiving.
[00:26:44.615 --> 00:26:45.356]  We're not forgetting.
[00:26:45.616 --> 00:26:48.117]  They're going to go to prison for this.
[00:26:50.638 --> 00:26:53.359]  Nuremberg 2.0, they can see what's building against them.
[00:26:53.379 --> 00:26:54.299]  It totally backfired.
[00:26:55.666 --> 00:26:58.749]  And so they're saying give them amnesty.
[00:26:58.809 --> 00:27:05.475]  But meanwhile, COVID vaccination proof still required to enter America in 2023.
[00:27:05.735 --> 00:27:08.457]  The only country doing it.
[00:27:09.298 --> 00:27:12.220]  So there is no amnesty for people coming to the U.S.
[00:27:12.301 --> 00:27:13.402]  or people leaving and coming.
[00:27:15.063 --> 00:27:17.085]  No, they're still coming after us.
[00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:20.528]  They're giving us no amnesty from their tyranny.
[00:27:21.496 --> 00:27:28.320]  They're coming after us now, more than ever, and targeting the doctors and scientists who were right, who were vindicated, like Sherry Tinpenny.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.301]  I'm on her show for two hours tomorrow morning.
[00:27:30.861 --> 00:27:35.824]  And Dr. Peter McCullough and countless others are targeting, trying to strip their license, and not even saying why.
[00:27:38.486 --> 00:27:40.187]  Very important article about Dr. Peter McCullough.
[00:27:42.077 --> 00:27:47.921]  On America Out Loud, why COVID-19 mass vaccination is a military operation.
[00:27:47.941 --> 00:27:52.384]  I'm going to have this article posted right now on InfoWars.com.
[00:27:52.425 --> 00:27:55.086]  He actually worked for this government agency.
[00:27:55.867 --> 00:28:02.732]  He's run programs for them and he exposes that it's mad scientists at the top of the Pentagon running the worldwide program.
[00:28:03.689 --> 00:28:12.716]  And that they're the ones creating weaponized versions of COVID that kill the vast majority, over 80% of those that come in contact with the ones they've got in the Boston lab and others.
[00:28:13.136 --> 00:28:15.638]  There's that famous meme of the woman mad at the cat at the table.
[00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:20.662]  They've changed it to say, what America needs right now is COVID amnesty.
[00:28:21.502 --> 00:28:24.384]  The cat says it's pronounced tribunal.
[00:28:27.226 --> 00:28:28.007]  So there you go.
[00:28:29.068 --> 00:28:34.893]   And China, of course, is bringing back all its big lockdowns that never Even went away?
[00:28:35.693 --> 00:28:44.920]  They're building COVID facilities all over the world under UN regulations and directives to lock us up during the next big power grab.
[00:28:45.421 --> 00:28:51.145]  But what an important article, COVID vaccines linked to plummeting fertility rate, German study finds.
[00:28:51.886 --> 00:28:52.986]  That's a powerful headline.
[00:28:55.528 --> 00:28:58.511]  But we put the full show headline up there, it tells it all.
[00:29:01.348 --> 00:29:03.030]  Germany, Sweden and the U.S.
[00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:05.092]  have basically the exact same numbers.
[00:29:06.814 --> 00:29:16.044]  A 3,600% increase in stillbirths and miscarriages of those that took the shots.
[00:29:17.045 --> 00:29:19.988]  They directly in the study show it's people taking the deadly shots.
[00:29:20.589 --> 00:29:23.509]   And if you look at The U.S.
[00:29:23.549 --> 00:29:25.109]  numbers, it follows the same number.
[00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:39.593]  And it actually matches up almost identically with the New England Journal of Medicine study a year ago of an 82% increase in miscarriages in the first and second trimester and a massive increase in stillbirths after that.
[00:29:41.193 --> 00:29:43.093]  That's over a 3,000% increase as well.
[00:29:43.513 --> 00:29:48.374]  So study after study after study by the German government, by the U.S.
[00:29:48.414 --> 00:29:54.458]   government, by the Swedish government, Now, what about Israel?
[00:29:54.498 --> 00:29:56.879]  They forced more shots than anybody on their public.
[00:29:57.799 --> 00:29:58.980]  Well, they got even higher numbers.
[00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:07.602]  And after them, the next is Australia and New Zealand, where they hold you as prisoners until they force all the shots they want on you.
[00:30:07.662 --> 00:30:09.603]  It is absolutely outrageous.
[00:30:09.643 --> 00:30:14.344]  And how were they able to carry all of this out?
[00:30:14.444 --> 00:30:16.844]  Well, we've been covering this for a week and a half now.
[00:30:18.585 --> 00:30:21.026]  First, broken the intercept, confirming everything we already told you.
[00:30:21.046 --> 00:30:22.106]  We had lots of other documents.
[00:30:23.322 --> 00:30:56.950]   But that under Obama and then secretly under Trump, he didn't run it, they were targeting him, the documents say, his own quote, executive branch, the bureaucrats, the permanent deep state, and accelerating under the third administration of Obama, Biden, under the third administration of Obama, they come right out in the open with the UN and the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center, all interfacing with the federal government, the DHS, On who to censor, and who to surveil, and who to debank?
[00:30:57.630 --> 00:30:58.792]  It's them meeting with the big banks?
[00:31:01.895 --> 00:31:03.076]  Absolutely criminal.
[00:31:03.096 --> 00:31:11.644]  So Rand Paul, there's a video, it's on Infowars.com, on Fox News vows under this bill to stop government and big tech colluding to censor speech.
[00:31:12.485 --> 00:31:15.127]  Well, they're surveilling you, and they're engaging in racketeering.
[00:31:15.147 --> 00:31:16.168]  There's already laws against it.
[00:31:16.268 --> 00:31:17.650]  Okay, sure, pass another one.
[00:31:18.899 --> 00:31:21.220]  Remember they had that disinformation board they were setting up?
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.500]  Well, turns out it was already set up, secretly operating.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:30.282]  The Disinformation Governance Board taking direct orders from Biden, the DHS, and the UN.
[00:31:30.342 --> 00:31:35.463]  But guess who the document says writes the rules that the UN then gives the orders to implement?
[00:31:36.163 --> 00:31:41.683]   the consortium of think tanks led by the anti-defamation league of the night breath
[00:31:41.683 --> 00:31:52.869]   don't believe me Just go research the Disinformation Governance Board.
[00:31:53.589 --> 00:31:57.910]  But if you go to Google, they'll misdirect you to the ADL saying nothing exists, it's not real.
[00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:04.771]  But you can actually go to the federal court documents and all the rest if you search on DuckDuckGo or even Bing will let you find it.
[00:32:05.051 --> 00:32:10.913]  But Google is totally controlled and you cannot get the information that Senator Rand Paul is talking about.
[00:32:10.933 --> 00:32:14.893]  They even censor and block him because it's an enemy operation.
[00:32:16.314 --> 00:32:17.214]  Total takeover.
[00:32:18.957 --> 00:32:22.876]   of the United States. So when we come back ahead of a special guest in the next hour,
[00:32:22.876 --> 00:32:27.837]   I want to just play a few of the clips in Australia and Europe and the United States
[00:32:27.837 --> 00:32:31.357]   and Canada where they were all lockstep following the same talking points. That those that didn't
[00:32:31.357 --> 00:32:35.597]   take the shots were gonna make everybody sick and that the shots worked 100% of the time and that we
[00:32:35.597 --> 00:32:38.957]   we were terrorists, we were criminals, we were racist, we were bad.
[00:32:38.957 --> 00:32:44.397]   Why David Icke's been listed by the EU as a type level three terrorist.
[00:32:44.634 --> 00:32:45.494]  Level 3 terrorist.
[00:32:45.855 --> 00:32:47.095]  Had the official EU document.
[00:32:47.436 --> 00:32:49.317]  Banned from Europe because he questions the shots.
[00:32:49.797 --> 00:32:52.319]  And he says there's secret cabals running the government.
[00:32:52.799 --> 00:32:53.640]  Not allowed to say that.
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.801]  And the secret cabal will ban you if you do.
[00:32:57.402 --> 00:32:58.563]  The globalists are losing, folks.
[00:32:58.663 --> 00:33:00.663]  Humanity's winning.
[00:33:00.663 --> 00:33:11.742]  Let it sink in that they're actually murdering us.
[00:33:12.492 --> 00:33:15.394]  The very groups that tell us there's too many of us all day and they want to depopulate us.
[00:33:15.974 --> 00:33:16.914]  Down to 500 million.
[00:33:17.555 --> 00:33:19.055]  Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, all of them.
[00:33:19.095 --> 00:33:20.176]  They're really doing it.
[00:33:20.256 --> 00:33:22.377]  Ted Turner, the whole sick group.
[00:33:24.638 --> 00:33:36.644]   And think about the miscarriages up. 3,600 Plus percent in the Western world, up even higher in places like Israel and Australia where they have even higher poison injection rates.
[00:33:36.724 --> 00:33:37.824]  It follows it exactly.
[00:33:37.844 --> 00:33:43.986]  I just showed you hard government data and findings by the German government that it's the shot.
[00:33:44.006 --> 00:33:49.248]  Because the government's just told by the UN what to do and they implemented it.
[00:33:50.229 --> 00:33:53.610]  And the UN's told what to do by the big corporations and the Pentagon.
[00:33:55.831 --> 00:33:55.991]  So...
[00:33:57.726 --> 00:33:59.307]  It hits its own troops with a deadly shot.
[00:33:59.427 --> 00:34:00.588]  It's an attack on all of us.
[00:34:00.968 --> 00:34:03.229]  They got to hit us all, so there's even death rates everywhere.
[00:34:03.569 --> 00:34:05.330]  We don't notice exactly what they're doing.
[00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:06.690]  But they got to hit the kids too.
[00:34:08.211 --> 00:34:15.895]  But here is British Member of Parliament, Andrew Bridge, calls for investigation into excess deaths in their relationship to the jabs.
[00:34:15.915 --> 00:34:19.277]  18 to 40 percent increase in death across the board.
[00:34:19.737 --> 00:34:23.839]  Myocarditis, heart attacks, huge weird synthetic blood clots, all confirmed.
[00:34:24.359 --> 00:34:26.160]  They're growing protein crystals in you.
[00:34:28.166 --> 00:34:28.706]  It's mad cow.
[00:34:29.346 --> 00:34:30.827]  Weaponized mad cow spike protein.
[00:34:32.047 --> 00:34:37.629]  Now, I had again, Peter McCullough, top science on your stage, affirming that.
[00:34:37.649 --> 00:34:38.350]  It's all in the studies.
[00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:39.230]  This is really going on.
[00:34:40.911 --> 00:34:44.772]  Now, it's got to stay cool.
[00:34:44.792 --> 00:34:47.053]  87 degrees or lower.
[00:34:47.073 --> 00:34:52.134]  That's why a lot of places, lazy folks, let it get too hot so it didn't hurt as many people as it would have.
[00:34:52.715 --> 00:34:53.335]  That's confirmed.
[00:34:55.004 --> 00:35:00.366]  And it needs to be injected directly in the body, preferably repeatedly, to take hold, to grow the colonies.
[00:35:01.707 --> 00:35:03.047]  That's why they want repeated boosters.
[00:35:04.288 --> 00:35:05.468]  So it's not obvious right up front.
[00:35:05.488 --> 00:35:08.430]  They begin to colonize, and then the more the protein is, the more it can grow.
[00:35:11.891 --> 00:35:16.935]   So let's go ahead now and play Then there's dozens of these clips all over the world.
[00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:18.516]  EU, you name it.
[00:35:18.556 --> 00:35:20.337]  Everybody coming out recognising they've been murdered.
[00:35:20.657 --> 00:35:22.638]  So the good news is, murderers, we know you did it.
[00:35:22.658 --> 00:35:23.479]  We're gonna get you.
[00:35:23.699 --> 00:35:24.539]  You're gonna be exposed.
[00:35:24.559 --> 00:35:26.540]  You murdering beyond Nazis.
[00:35:27.261 --> 00:35:26.540]  2.0.
[00:35:27.541 --> 00:35:27.961]  Satanist.
[00:35:27.981 --> 00:35:28.461]  Here it is.
[00:35:29.982 --> 00:35:31.163]  I wish I had longer to speak.
[00:35:31.183 --> 00:35:37.066]  Finally, the excess deaths we're suffering at the moment in this country, across Europe and in the Americas.
[00:35:39.016 --> 00:35:42.138]  What analysis is the government making of these excess deaths?
[00:35:42.158 --> 00:35:52.885]  But even a casual glance at the data shows that there's a very strong correlation between vaccine uptake and the level of excess deaths being found in that country.
[00:35:53.226 --> 00:35:55.027]  Surely we must have an investigation.
[00:35:55.327 --> 00:35:58.969]  These are tens of thousands of people who are dying more than we're expecting.
[00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:00.650]  It's really, really important.
[00:36:00.851 --> 00:36:08.656]  And I think if we don't get this right, no one's going to believe we're going to lose trust in politicians and we're going to lose trust in our medicine and our medical system.
[00:36:08.996 --> 00:36:09.996]  Thank you very much.
[00:36:09.996 --> 00:36:13.996]   Which was the plan, as I told you three years ago, to collapse everything.
[00:36:13.996 --> 00:36:16.996]   See, it's all planned, but they think they won't get the blame.
[00:36:16.996 --> 00:36:19.996]   They think our governments will. Our governments are their stooges.
[00:36:19.996 --> 00:36:22.996]  We need our governments to arrest the globalists.
[00:36:22.996 --> 00:36:23.996]  We must take control of them.
[00:36:24.426 --> 00:36:27.809]  We're about to, in 35 hours, if we can.
[00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:29.731]  Now let's play a bunch of back-to-back.
[00:36:29.991 --> 00:36:34.215]  I've got hours of this, but we'll just play 7, 8, 9, 10 minutes of it until we go to the break and come back with more.
[00:36:34.715 --> 00:36:39.840]  Here is the system bullying people here, France, Europe, Australia, you name it.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.901]  Macron said France won't play.
[00:36:41.921 --> 00:36:42.442]  It says we have.
[00:36:42.462 --> 00:36:45.284]  We're going to make your life hell until you take the shots, including your children.
[00:36:45.304 --> 00:36:46.105]  You'll never stop us.
[00:36:46.425 --> 00:36:47.386]  We're going to break you.
[00:36:48.207 --> 00:36:50.329]  Just go ahead and play a smattering of these back-to-back.
[00:36:51.519 --> 00:36:55.020]  Yeah, it turns out, yeah, it turns out that this was all a lie.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:55.560]  Yep.
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.581]  I was really just kind of hoping we could put all this behind us and move on.
[00:36:59.741 --> 00:37:01.541]  Is that like, is that an apology?
[00:37:01.601 --> 00:37:03.242]  Because it doesn't really sound like one.
[00:37:03.462 --> 00:37:07.783]  I know that I called you a grandma killer, but I really just wanted what was best for you.
[00:37:07.803 --> 00:37:11.504]  I actually couldn't visit my grandma in the hospital or even attend her funeral.
[00:37:11.664 --> 00:37:13.344]  But my heart was in the right place.
[00:37:13.584 --> 00:37:15.387]  I also lost my business and my job.
[00:37:15.587 --> 00:37:16.989]  I had good intentions.
[00:37:17.229 --> 00:37:20.474]  And my kids' social, mental, and physical development was also hurt.
[00:37:20.654 --> 00:37:22.717]  Listen, we just didn't know.
[00:37:22.737 --> 00:37:23.298]  I knew.
[00:37:23.318 --> 00:37:24.119]  Lots of people knew.
[00:37:24.179 --> 00:37:25.300]  But you refused to listen.
[00:37:25.381 --> 00:37:28.245]  Instead, you called us names and wished death upon us.
[00:37:28.525 --> 00:37:30.448]  Let's just call a truce, okay?
[00:37:30.768 --> 00:37:33.451]  But according to your hat, you care about social justice.
[00:37:33.831 --> 00:37:35.533]  What does that have to do with anything?
[00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:37.515]  Why don't you care about justice here?
[00:37:37.635 --> 00:37:40.558]  I don't hear you demanding apologies or reparations.
[00:37:40.818 --> 00:37:44.382]  Because that would have to come from me and we just need to move on.
[00:37:44.522 --> 00:37:46.204]  So you don't believe in accountability?
[00:37:47.847 --> 00:37:55.289]  We have to start doing things for the greater good of society and not for idiots who think that they can do their own research or that they are above the law and they can break the rules.
[00:37:55.109 --> 00:38:00.549]   this to occur. Don't you want peace? I found this sign on the ground, maybe you recognize it.
[00:38:00.549 --> 00:38:09.429]   We have to start doing things for the greater good of society and not for idiots who think
[00:38:09.429 --> 00:38:14.869]   that they can do their own research or that they are above the law and they can break the rules.
[00:38:14.869 --> 00:38:19.509]  Australia, Novak Djokovic, Australia.
[00:38:19.655 --> 00:38:20.837]  Australia said, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:38:21.398 --> 00:38:25.143]  We're going to look at the greater good of everyone in our society and you're not part of it.
[00:38:25.323 --> 00:38:34.675]  And people have also heard, well, these are new vaccines and they've been done quicker than usually takes years and years and years to approve a vaccine.
[00:38:35.416 --> 00:38:49.483]  Well, the reason it was able to be done quicker is because we threw more money and more people to do the work than ever had been done before to get a vaccine because it was so important to get it run.
[00:38:49.823 --> 00:38:57.467]   There wasn't any shortcuts taken, there weren't any steps Lord knows what happened if he didn't partake.
[00:38:57.527 --> 00:39:04.993]  But back then, anyone who refused to get vaccinated would get ratted out immediately because we knew that person could hurt other people.
[00:39:04.893 --> 00:39:08.452]  that vaccines absolutely are safe.
[00:39:08.452 --> 00:39:11.373]  Lord knows what happened if he didn't partake.
[00:39:11.373 --> 00:39:16.331]   But back then, anyone who refused to get vaccinated would get ratted out immediately
[00:39:16.331 --> 00:39:18.612]  because we knew that person could hurt other people.
[00:39:18.612 --> 00:39:21.972]  The commonweal was a commonweal.
[00:39:21.972 --> 00:39:25.492]   Now engaged in a similar struggle with COVID, Eisenhower would be a gas.
[00:39:25.724 --> 00:39:33.067]  We have immunocompromised people who are incubators for every variant to come, walking around lawfully unvaccinated.
[00:39:33.087 --> 00:39:34.388]  That's psychotic.
[00:39:35.108 --> 00:39:38.149]  We have companies that have tried hard to get people vaccinated, now backing down.
[00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:44.472]  We have governors who want to be president by grandstanding on a foolish state's right issue, the right to get sick and get other people sick.
[00:39:45.359 --> 00:39:48.061]  So it's time to admit that we have to go to war against COVID.
[00:39:48.442 --> 00:39:49.983]  Require vaccination universally.
[00:39:50.323 --> 00:39:51.384]  Have the military run it.
[00:39:51.784 --> 00:39:57.789]  If you don't want to get vaccinated, you better be ready to prove your conscientious objector status in court.
[00:39:58.089 --> 00:40:02.253]  And even then, you need to help in the war effort by staying home until we finally beat this thing.
[00:40:03.114 --> 00:40:13.062]  Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated, even though the vaccine is safe, effective, and free.
[00:40:13.988 --> 00:40:18.610]  Nobody will be safe if not everybody is vaccinated.
[00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:30.255]  Young people, you are championing an open internet and a two trillion digital access plan to bring the world online and prevent internet shutdown.
[00:40:30.575 --> 00:40:42.860]  And you are presenting new ways to minimize the spread of misinformation and you want to combat dangerous extremist views in the internet.
[00:40:43.166 --> 00:40:45.529]  For us to simply go back to some kind of normal.
[00:40:46.149 --> 00:40:48.252]  But to be honest, normal was the problem.
[00:40:48.372 --> 00:40:54.980]  And today, we have a very rare and narrow opportunity for us to build back better and leave that old norm behind.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.762]  Let me be very, very clear.
[00:40:57.282 --> 00:40:58.744]  Nothing is off the table.
[00:40:59.365 --> 00:41:01.828]  Any and every idea at this stage is worth considering.
[00:41:02.308 --> 00:41:03.028]  Speaking the truth.
[00:41:03.068 --> 00:41:04.128]  You have to have leaders.
[00:41:04.568 --> 00:41:05.769]  The data will help.
[00:41:05.809 --> 00:41:09.309]  Yeah, of course, I said that is true, but also, I mean, in addition to.
[00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.750]  You've got to have people start speaking the truth.
[00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:16.151]  You can't have them speaking out of both sides of their mouth saying, you know, I trust the science and I'm doing this.
[00:41:16.231 --> 00:41:25.433]  I heard you had Jerome Adams on and he's saying, talking about some right-wing conservative propaganda host who are saying, oh yeah, no one really said get vaccine.
[00:41:25.453 --> 00:41:26.693]  They said, I believe in the science.
[00:41:27.193 --> 00:41:28.294]  And it's up to you to get it.
[00:41:28.634 --> 00:41:30.716]  We can't have mealy-mouthed people like that.
[00:41:31.057 --> 00:41:32.878]  You have to be more direct.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.082]  A more concerted effort to say, get vaccinated.
[00:41:37.483 --> 00:41:40.585]  Because you're not just killing yourself, you're gonna kill other people.
[00:41:41.368 --> 00:41:42.828]  That's what you have to start telling people.
[00:41:43.068 --> 00:41:48.250]  You gotta start telling people, if you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this office or this place of business.
[00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:50.970]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come to work.
[00:41:51.370 --> 00:41:53.811]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this gym.
[00:41:54.431 --> 00:41:57.812]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this, get onto this airplane.
[00:41:59.172 --> 00:42:01.253]  It has nothing to do with freedom!
[00:42:02.267 --> 00:42:03.527]  This has nothing to do with liberty.
[00:42:03.787 --> 00:42:07.848]  You don't have the freedom and the liberty to put other people in jeopardy.
[00:42:08.448 --> 00:42:09.208]  You don't have that.
[00:42:09.489 --> 00:42:11.489]  You have to drive the speed limit.
[00:42:11.989 --> 00:42:13.409]  You have to obey the rules.
[00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:17.290]  Put some rules in place that will demand that people get vaccinated.
[00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:19.851]  Rules like you can't mandate an experimental shot?
[00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:23.912]  Rules like you guys said it worked when it didn't and you knew it didn't?
[00:42:24.272 --> 00:42:27.332]  Rules like you said it had been tested and all been approved when it wasn't?
[00:42:28.213 --> 00:42:29.893]  We're gonna go to break and start the next hour.
[00:42:31.118 --> 00:42:32.138]  We're going to get into the election.
[00:42:32.158 --> 00:42:33.339]  We're going to get into evidence.
[00:42:33.359 --> 00:42:34.959]  They're getting ready to try to steal it big time.
[00:42:35.639 --> 00:42:36.579]  And so much more.
[00:42:36.639 --> 00:42:39.640]  Laura Loomer is going to be popping in then Sunday live tonight.
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.441]  I interviewed Dr. Peter McCullough for two plus hours yesterday in studio.
[00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:53.443]  We're going to re-air that to our radio stations out there coming up today in the third and fourth hour of the Sunday live.
[00:42:53.463 --> 00:42:54.844]  We've expanded weekend broadcasts.
[00:42:54.864 --> 00:42:58.885]  We're intending soon to start live shows on the weekend and some at night.
[00:42:58.905 --> 00:42:59.625]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:43:00.612 --> 00:43:02.212]  But a lot of stuff's been gearing up around here.
[00:43:03.213 --> 00:43:06.053]  Please remember, we have Black Friday sale comes early.
[00:43:06.073 --> 00:43:08.113]  Our biggest sale of the year just builds towards Christmas.
[00:43:08.634 --> 00:43:10.214]  But this is as big as the sales get.
[00:43:10.414 --> 00:43:12.634]  It'll continue to Christmas, but we'll sell a lot of stuff.
[00:43:12.994 --> 00:43:15.115]  But almost all the products are still in stock right now.
[00:43:15.335 --> 00:43:24.417]  X2, X3, Vitamin Mineral Fusion, DNA Force Plus, up to 60% off at Infowarshore.com with promo code 1776.
[00:43:24.617 --> 00:43:25.597]  We're doing God's work.
[00:43:25.737 --> 00:43:37.637]   to get back to the game. Our All right, Laura Lermer's coming up.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.021]  She's heavily involved.
[00:43:39.161 --> 00:43:44.386]  Battling the globalists with national ads she put out that are going mega viral.
[00:43:44.406 --> 00:43:48.404]   Saw her on the war room with Steve Bannon wanted to get her on.
[00:43:48.604 --> 00:43:54.026]  She'll be doing some election night coverage with us, along with Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, and so many others.
[00:43:54.086 --> 00:43:56.167]  Robert Barnes, Tuesday night, into the morning.
[00:43:56.907 --> 00:43:57.988]  Ali Alexander and more.
[00:43:58.548 --> 00:44:00.049]  But coming up, breaking out.
[00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:03.430]  Outage in PA voter database on Election Day nears.
[00:44:04.871 --> 00:44:11.874]  The database put in a few years ago to make sure only voters could vote magically has failed, and they say it won't be there to make sure Fetterman doesn't cheat.
[00:44:12.334 --> 00:44:25.404]   We'll be covering that Coming up, ladies and gentlemen, with a whole other stack of key, several big stacks of key election news with Laura Loomer and more throughout this hour.
[00:44:25.424 --> 00:44:39.528]   And as I said, Peter McCullough will be in our Three and four tonight, his most powerful interview ever, where he takes the gloves off big time and says, yes, it's an inside the population plan mass murder.
[00:44:39.568 --> 00:44:40.428]  He's known it for years.
[00:44:40.468 --> 00:44:41.469]  We've had private conversations.
[00:44:42.090 --> 00:44:46.090]   But here is the latest report on the theft going on in Brazil.
[00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:58.890]   Before his first election, the radical opposition attempted to assassinate Jair Bolsonaro.
[00:44:58.915 --> 00:45:03.038]  Jair Bolsonaro has been left in a serious but stable condition in hospital.
[00:45:03.558 --> 00:45:07.662]  This after being stabbed while drumming up support ahead of next month's vote.
[00:45:08.402 --> 00:45:11.926]  Hospital officials say it could take two months for him to recover.
[00:45:11.966 --> 00:45:19.876]  They failed and President Bolsonaro went on to become today's leading model of what a world leader should be.
[00:45:20.296 --> 00:45:21.498]  A man of the people.
[00:45:21.978 --> 00:45:26.184]  He spoke out against the COVID pandemic hoax from the very beginning.
[00:45:26.795 --> 00:45:33.799]  Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro said he will not take a coronavirus vaccine, calling it his, quote, right.
[00:45:34.219 --> 00:45:41.303]  He made statements live on social media Thursday, adding that Congress was not likely to require Brazilians to take a vaccine.
[00:45:41.363 --> 00:45:44.684]  He thanked the farmers of Brazil for not shutting down.
[00:45:44.704 --> 00:45:46.285]  You didn't stay at home.
[00:45:46.305 --> 00:45:49.007]  You didn't take precautions.
[00:45:51.088 --> 00:45:53.049]  We have to face our problems.
[00:45:53.868 --> 00:46:00.868]  and declared every single Brazilian as being essential.
[00:46:00.868 --> 00:46:12.868]  [speaking in Portuguese]
[00:46:12.868 --> 00:46:16.868]  And now the world is realizing that Bolsonaro was right.
[00:46:16.958 --> 00:46:21.958]   No matter how much the media tries to smear him, the people of Brazil love him.
[00:46:21.958 --> 00:46:24.958]  (speaking Portuguese)
[00:46:24.958 --> 00:46:27.958]  (crowd cheering)
[00:46:27.958 --> 00:46:45.958]   The awakening masses in Brazil, like everywhere else in the world today,
[00:46:45.958 --> 00:46:47.958]  We're expecting election fraud.
[00:46:48.462 --> 00:46:54.288]  Polls show Bolsonaro still trailing behind left-wing former leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
[00:46:55.149 --> 00:46:56.970]  Polls are lying.
[00:46:57.331 --> 00:46:59.573]  If Lula is really the frontrunner, where is he?
[00:47:00.073 --> 00:47:00.894]  Where are his crowds?
[00:47:01.355 --> 00:47:04.137]  We are here to show that Bolsonaro represents the majority.
[00:47:04.538 --> 00:47:06.780]  He will only lose the election if there is fraud.
[00:47:07.260 --> 00:47:10.203]  And the people will take to the streets to stop that from happening.
[00:47:10.223 --> 00:47:11.765]  And they have taken to the streets.
[00:47:12.345 --> 00:47:19.868]  All over Brazil, the people are not willing to go the way of Joe Obama, the way of the World Economic Forum.
[00:47:20.528 --> 00:47:23.509]  What will it take for the people to be represented?
[00:47:24.189 --> 00:47:29.051]  And what will America do if the anticipated red wave is stolen?
[00:47:29.451 --> 00:47:35.113]  The president's office may have conceded defeat, but many of Jair Bolsonaro's millions of supporters have not.
[00:47:36.834 --> 00:47:39.495]  They took to the streets of Sao Paulo in their thousands.
[00:47:41.713 --> 00:47:48.399]  The national flag waved above the crowds as they gathered outside the headquarters of the military's southeastern command.
[00:47:48.419 --> 00:47:51.561]  They're calling for an intervention.
[00:47:52.022 --> 00:47:54.264]  Put simply, they want a military coup.
[00:47:57.166 --> 00:48:02.110]  They despise the leftist policies of Lula da Silva, and they want him out by any means.
[00:48:05.693 --> 00:48:09.373]   I think the red wave that's coming is going to be like the elevator doors opening up in
[00:48:09.373 --> 00:48:10.372]  the shining.
[00:48:10.372 --> 00:48:11.372]  [laughter]
[00:48:11.372 --> 00:48:12.372]  [laughter]
[00:48:12.372 --> 00:48:13.372]  [laughter]
[00:48:13.372 --> 00:48:14.372]  [laughter]
[00:48:14.372 --> 00:48:15.372]  [laughter]
[00:48:15.372 --> 00:48:16.372]  [laughter]
[00:48:16.372 --> 00:48:18.693]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:48:18.693 --> 00:48:21.273]  (upbeat music)
[00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:26.687]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:48:28.527 --> 00:48:33.791]  And we are now into hour number two of this live Sunday night broadcast, hour three and four.
[00:48:33.831 --> 00:48:35.933]  Dr. Peter McCullough in studio.
[00:48:36.493 --> 00:48:44.299]  He's taking the gloves off, saying yes, it is the depopulation weapon, the poison shot, one of the most respected doctors and scientists, one of the most peer-reviewed people out there.
[00:48:44.759 --> 00:48:47.461]  That's coming up in hour number three and four.
[00:48:47.941 --> 00:48:55.047]  And then tomorrow morning, AM American Journal, Harrison Smith, my own show, 11 to 3 p.m., the War Room, Owen Schroer's War Room.
[00:48:55.963 --> 00:48:56.884]  Three to six p.m.
[00:48:56.984 --> 00:48:58.866]  And then don't forget kicking off Tuesday morning.
[00:48:58.886 --> 00:49:06.413]  We're going right through midnight election coverage and we're gonna get into all that now in the next 55 minutes with Laura Limmer.
[00:49:06.433 --> 00:49:08.995]  She's riding shotgun with us as a political analyst.
[00:49:09.035 --> 00:49:10.636]  She's one of the most banned people in the world.
[00:49:12.258 --> 00:49:13.179]  The most banned woman.
[00:49:14.171 --> 00:49:21.659]  And she has run for Congress and almost won recently by just a few points, despite the Republican establishment working against her.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.522]  But that's a side issue.
[00:49:23.542 --> 00:49:32.672]  I want to get her take on the election, on Trump, the Santas, and that rift on what she's predicting for the midterms that open up in just about 35 hours.
[00:49:34.366 --> 00:49:47.253]  We're also going to be looking at a PAC that she's involved with that's doing a great job putting out some powerful national TV ads exposing the Democrats in general, their poison shots, and their penchant for promoting pedophilia that have gone super viral.
[00:49:47.553 --> 00:49:52.855]  Saw Steve Bannon in his war room covering it with her a few days ago, so I wanted to get her on with us.
[00:49:53.936 --> 00:49:57.198]  Before we drill into these ads and the rest of it, Laura, great to see you there.
[00:49:57.378 --> 00:49:58.539]  Loomerd.com.
[00:49:59.059 --> 00:50:01.981]  The only way people can find you is by actually going to your site.
[00:50:02.041 --> 00:50:03.602]  You're one of the most censored people out there.
[00:50:03.642 --> 00:50:09.026]  They can find some of the conservative social media you're on there, but you're still doing amazing work, and in many ways more effective than ever.
[00:50:09.346 --> 00:50:10.067]  Loomerd.com.
[00:50:10.327 --> 00:50:18.612]  Laura, with 30-something hours left until the polls open, obviously red tsunami, but can the seawall of election fraud block it?
[00:50:18.652 --> 00:50:19.473]  What do you expect to see?
[00:50:22.409 --> 00:50:24.272]  Well, Alex, thanks so much for having me on.
[00:50:24.332 --> 00:50:25.453]  I appreciate it.
[00:50:25.794 --> 00:50:38.452]  And look, as an America First candidate myself, who recently had my own election stolen from me during my primary here in Florida in August, I'll say that, you know, I'm cautiously optimistic, but I'm not really getting my hopes up.
[00:50:39.032 --> 00:50:43.556]  The Republican Party has done absolutely nothing to address voter fraud.
[00:50:43.616 --> 00:50:45.417]  I'm talking about machine fraud.
[00:50:45.457 --> 00:50:50.200]  I'm talking about massive mail-in ballot fraud since the stolen 2020 election.
[00:50:50.801 --> 00:50:59.967]  To this day, the official RNC and Republican Party leadership has not even issued an official statement admitting that the 2020 election was stolen.
[00:51:00.548 --> 00:51:06.031]   Here in Florida, you had politicians like Governor Ron DeSantis Promising, right?
[00:51:06.371 --> 00:51:10.933]  Promising that he was going to ban Big Tech social media censorship in the state of Florida.
[00:51:11.253 --> 00:51:16.755]  But Big Tech, as we have seen, is allowed to roam completely wild here in the state of Florida.
[00:51:17.135 --> 00:51:21.957]  Zero punishment whatsoever from Big Tech completely deplatforming and silencing people.
[00:51:22.637 --> 00:51:28.319]  And so there aren't really a lot of measures that have been taken nationwide to prevent the fraud.
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:49.749]   However, I think that Given the fact, right, that the Democrat Party has now decided to embrace full-blown pedophilia and violent criminals, and they are advocating for open borders, allowing for criminals and terrorists and poisonous fentanyl to come across our border, over 5 million illegal aliens coming in since Joe Biden.
[00:51:51.218 --> 00:51:56.182]  You know, occupied the White House as an illegitimate dementia patient.
[00:51:56.783 --> 00:52:01.447]  Even Democrats, even your most moderate Democrats are saying that this is too much for them.
[00:52:01.548 --> 00:52:07.794]  So I'm thinking that maybe this extreme radical shift in the Democrat Party might be enough to push the Republicans over.
[00:52:08.134 --> 00:52:15.281]  But I do think, and from seeing it myself here on the ground in Florida, we don't have election integrity in this country.
[00:52:15.401 --> 00:52:20.465]  And so people definitely need to be vigilant and aware because the cheaters are going to be out.
[00:52:20.505 --> 00:52:28.771]  We've already seen videos in Florida from Broward County of people illegally stuffing ballot boxes with multiple ballots this election season.
[00:52:29.111 --> 00:52:34.155]  People need to be alert because people are going to be cheating to try to stop this red wave.
[00:52:34.175 --> 00:52:36.277]  Well that's right, there's been arrests all over the country.
[00:52:36.337 --> 00:52:44.964]  Texas, Wisconsin, open charges where they're just catching Democrats already creating fake ballots and stuffing them.
[00:52:45.004 --> 00:52:48.187]  But let's be very clear, we know how they generally steal it.
[00:52:48.567 --> 00:52:54.412]  With these mail-in ballots, not absentee, those are fine, those are people that are on record already as voters and they ask for them themselves and they get them.
[00:52:54.793 --> 00:53:12.245]   But by bombing everywhere with these fake ballots, these ballots that can be faked, these raw blank ballots, They then put the names of dead people and folks that have moved out of the state or out of the jurisdiction on those, but they've only got so many bullets in their gun, so they can only use them in particular areas.
[00:53:12.625 --> 00:53:19.590]  That's why Biden's announced, Fetterman's announced, Obama's announced, Hillary's announced, MSNBC's announced, CNN, New York Times.
[00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:21.611]  Yes, in key battleground states.
[00:53:22.051 --> 00:53:26.176]  Like Wisconsin, like Michigan, like Pennsylvania, like Arizona, over and over again.
[00:53:26.696 --> 00:53:28.598]  We're not going to know on election night.
[00:53:28.799 --> 00:53:32.002]  So we always knew before, but the Democrats are telling us, no, no, it's completely normal.
[00:53:32.323 --> 00:53:32.863]  You're not going to know.
[00:53:33.737 --> 00:53:35.058]  And now this in Pennsylvania.
[00:53:35.778 --> 00:53:44.184]  As folks know, a few years ago they created an election integrity database run by the state to simply check and make sure that the person that's voted, voted.
[00:53:44.224 --> 00:53:50.327]  So once they voted, it's in a database that they did vote so that the same name can't vote multiple times.
[00:53:50.628 --> 00:53:55.090]  So we know that Fetterman's losing by such tsunami levels in the real internal polling they've got.
[00:53:55.350 --> 00:53:57.672]  They don't have enough dead people or fake names to do it.
[00:53:58.032 --> 00:54:05.875]  So they have to cut off the election integrity computer system, and now that's been shut off, and the Democrats are saying, sorry, it's not going to be there for the election.
[00:54:06.075 --> 00:54:08.356]  So now it's a total free-for-all in Pennsylvania.
[00:54:08.636 --> 00:54:09.076]  Breaking.
[00:54:09.656 --> 00:54:11.357]  Outage in PA voter database.
[00:54:11.537 --> 00:54:12.617]  Election day nears.
[00:54:12.997 --> 00:54:16.758]  The computer system the state runs to make sure there's no election fraud is down.
[00:54:17.019 --> 00:54:18.239]  What do you make of that, Laura Loomer?
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.062]  Well, it's no surprise, and you're absolutely correct, Alex.
[00:54:23.142 --> 00:54:37.014]   It's now why, all of a sudden, we've seen a lot of, you know, so-called Democrat Party political strategists and analysts and a lot of these pundits on CNN and MSNBC talking about how the Republicans Are going to steal the election.
[00:54:37.354 --> 00:54:38.195]  And so it's funny, right?
[00:54:38.235 --> 00:54:46.143]  Because they always told us in the aftermath of 2020 that we had the most secure election systems in this country and that it was impossible to steal elections.
[00:54:46.483 --> 00:54:48.725]  And now you're actually seeing reports, right?
[00:54:49.545 --> 00:54:56.724]   early pre-election day reports from these political pundits and Democrat Party strategists
[00:54:56.724 --> 00:55:02.185]   because I think that they know that deep down inside if we were to truly have free and fair
[00:55:02.185 --> 00:55:06.424]   elections without any cheating in this country, it would be a massive red wave.
[00:55:06.424 --> 00:55:10.424]  It would truly be a sweeping red wave in this country.
[00:55:10.424 --> 00:55:17.145]   But they have to continuously justify the craziness, okay, and the absolute radical
[00:55:17.145 --> 00:55:22.145]   communist takeover of their own party because I don't even think Democrats are excited to
[00:55:22.821 --> 00:55:30.144]  You see Barack Obama, he's been stumping for some candidates in some of these swing states, and he's telling people, you have to get out and vote.
[00:55:30.184 --> 00:55:32.425]  These numbers are not good for the Democrat Party.
[00:55:32.865 --> 00:55:44.796]  The lowest early voting turnout numbers, lower than 2018, especially here in Florida if you compare the numbers from Democrat early voting turnout in 2018 during the midterm race to the midterms now.
[00:55:45.196 --> 00:56:03.871]   And so there's not a lot of enthusiasm in the Democrat Party because I think that really the Democrat Party has become so radical, okay, so pro-crime, pro-pedophilia, pro-open borders that a lot of Democrats are either going to be voting Republican or sitting this one out.
[00:56:04.691 --> 00:56:06.272]  Let's elaborate on that since you mentioned it.
[00:56:06.672 --> 00:56:21.220]  Here is Obama and a bunch of other star-studded top Democrats with Uncle Fester, the literal troll creature, Fetterman, who can't even talk, and he makes Biden look like the most eloquent orator in history since William Shakespeare or something.
[00:56:22.981 --> 00:56:31.509]  Here they are in Pennsylvania at their biggest rally, and it's not even the amount of people at a high school basketball game in a 2A town.
[00:56:31.869 --> 00:56:35.592]  I mean, it's literally maybe 10,000, 5,000 people.
[00:56:35.632 --> 00:56:36.693]  I mean, this is pathetic.
[00:56:36.754 --> 00:56:40.514]   So they had to black curtain it all off to make it look bigger for the media.
[00:56:40.514 --> 00:56:42.874]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:56:42.874 --> 00:56:49.193]  [LAUGH] Yeah, it's absolutely shameful and you're right.
[00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.991]  You're right, Alex.
[00:56:50.071 --> 00:56:51.472]  I mean, here you have Fetterman.
[00:56:51.812 --> 00:57:08.943]  For those who didn't watch the debate in Pennsylvania the other night between John Fetterman and Dr. Oz, they actually made Dr. Oz seem palatable, which is pretty hard to do given the fact that Dr. Oz isn't exactly the most MAGA, America First Republican out there.
[00:57:09.124 --> 00:57:11.025]  I personally preferred Kathy Barnett.
[00:57:11.825 --> 00:57:17.568]  But at the end of the day, John Fetterman, you said it yourself, he's in worse physical and cognitive shape than Joe Biden.
[00:57:18.269 --> 00:57:23.912]  I do believe that John Fetterman suffered a stroke after taking a lethal death jab, right?
[00:57:23.952 --> 00:57:31.856]  He was promoting the COVID vaccine and then shortly after announcing he took the vaccine and the booster, he had a stroke and that's why he can't speak.
[00:57:32.276 --> 00:57:39.320]  And so if anybody should be the poster child for why you should not take the COVID vaccine, I'm pretty sure it's John Fetterman.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:42.802]  And by the way, even though I don't like Fetterman, he's obviously very out of control and corrupt.
[00:57:44.223 --> 00:57:54.530]  If people would just tell him, take a bunch of ivermectin, even when you have a serious onset of the protein crystals, taking large doses of ivermectin has been documented in major studies, would at least stop them growing.
[00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:59.269]   That's why people that have had really bad COVID, you kill long COVID by taking ivermectin.
[00:57:59.269 --> 00:58:07.990]  It's Sunday, November 6, 2022.
[00:58:08.336 --> 00:58:15.783]  We're covering the midterm actual election day that kicks off in just 35 hours.
[00:58:16.644 --> 00:58:21.568]  I want to put an image back on screen for TV viewers, for radio listeners, I'll describe it.
[00:58:21.588 --> 00:58:23.210]  It's just an image of Betterman.
[00:58:24.594 --> 00:58:26.637]  Who literally doesn't know what planet he's on.
[00:58:27.338 --> 00:58:28.520]  Not just his speech patterns.
[00:58:29.101 --> 00:58:30.603]  You've had a stroke and have a speech problem.
[00:58:30.623 --> 00:58:32.646]  You talk like this or have trouble.
[00:58:33.187 --> 00:58:34.729]  Is your mouth paralyzed partially?
[00:58:35.250 --> 00:58:37.113]  No, he's got cognitive problems.
[00:58:37.293 --> 00:58:38.816]  Obvious brainstem problems.
[00:58:40.874 --> 00:58:43.215]  He tries to read off a teleprompter and can't do it.
[00:58:44.016 --> 00:58:46.878]  Everything he says is worse than Biden.
[00:58:47.198 --> 00:58:50.340]  But that's what Obama loves, is zombies.
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:55.983]  Perfect puppets that'll do what they're told, so he and his controllers can run them.
[00:58:56.003 --> 00:58:58.425]  This is the next phase of puppets.
[00:58:58.445 --> 00:59:09.131]  You have Biden, you have Obama, you have Fetterman, all there at a arena that looks like it might hold 20,000 people, and maybe there's 10,000 in it, with Trump getting 50, 60, 70.
[00:59:12.014 --> 00:59:14.515]  100,000.
[00:59:12.094 --> 00:59:14.515]  I mean, that is maximum.
[00:59:14.835 --> 00:59:15.415]  Maximum.
[00:59:15.495 --> 00:59:17.616]  Maybe 6-7,000 right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:18.557 --> 00:59:20.977]  So, I mean, that arena looks smaller than the Moody Center in Austin.
[00:59:20.997 --> 00:59:21.378]  That holds like 6,000.
[00:59:21.498 --> 00:59:22.978]  Yeah, maybe that's 3,000, 4,000.
[00:59:23.158 --> 00:59:23.919]  I don't know.
[00:59:23.979 --> 00:59:26.159]  It's a very small crowd.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.220]  Put it back on screen for a minute for me.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.461]  Go ahead and pan over.
[00:59:29.901 --> 00:59:32.122]  Those bleachers, let's just say it's 1,000 on that side.
[00:59:32.142 --> 00:59:34.363]  1,000 up at the bleachers on the other side.
[00:59:34.443 --> 00:59:35.423]  And maybe on the ground, maybe 2,000, 3,000.
[00:59:36.243 --> 00:59:37.544]  Maybe behind them, maybe another 500.
[00:59:41.731 --> 00:59:46.731]  I mean, wow, that's not even 5,000 people, boys and girls.
[00:59:46.731 --> 00:59:51.231]  I mean, (laughs)
[00:59:51.231 --> 00:59:57.331]   a 3A football game in Texas has got a lot more people than that.
[00:59:58.251 --> 00:59:58.472]  Wow.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:00.641]  So let's play a couple clips here.
[01:00:00.661 --> 01:00:01.662]  Here's some of the latest, Fetterman.
[01:00:02.643 --> 01:00:06.866]  It's not like he was in high wind and then the American flags fell down sometime during his speech.
[01:00:07.246 --> 01:00:16.153]  Right as he gets up, they archetypally all fall down, showing there was no preparation to put sandbags on him, which again is an omen, because they don't care.
[01:00:16.173 --> 01:00:17.094]  They don't think things through.
[01:00:17.434 --> 01:00:22.619]  And then here he is saying he is against Roe v. Wade.
[01:00:22.839 --> 01:00:27.382]  Doesn't know what planet he's on, even though he's super bloodthirsty and pro-abortion.
[01:00:27.202 --> 01:00:34.202]  and here it is.
[01:00:34.202 --> 01:00:38.202]  I'm running to serve Pennsylvania.
[01:00:38.165 --> 01:00:39.826]  I run on Roe v. Wade.
[01:00:40.847 --> 01:00:44.070]  I celebrate the demise of Roe v. Wade.
[01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:49.034]  You know, these are not out of context.
[01:00:49.054 --> 01:00:50.295]  We can play more of it if you'd like.
[01:00:51.176 --> 01:00:52.037]  I mean, I was watching...
[01:00:53.154 --> 01:00:57.439]  His speech is usually about two minutes long anyways, and it literally sounds like his brain's been put in a blender.
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:02.565]  Laura Loomer, is this not archetypal of who these slaves of Satan are?
[01:01:02.906 --> 01:01:08.673]  I mean, this is pathetic, but Obama is smiling like a Cheshire cat when he's even found a better zombie than Biden.
[01:01:11.027 --> 01:01:12.867]  Well, you're absolutely correct, Alex.
[01:01:12.988 --> 01:01:14.708]  And it's like what you said, right?
[01:01:15.028 --> 01:01:19.189]  We already know that this is the third term for Barack Hussein Obama.
[01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:21.630]  Joe Biden doesn't even know what day it is.
[01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:24.531]  I don't even think Joe Biden knows who Joe Biden is.
[01:01:25.091 --> 01:01:32.633]  And you're correct in that Barack Hussein Obama, he likes puppets because he's the one that's really controlling things and pulling all the strings behind the scenes.
[01:01:32.693 --> 01:01:37.125]   And he wants people who really can't think for themselves, people who are not going
[01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:41.556]   to push back, people who are not really going to put up much opposition
[01:01:41.556 --> 01:01:46.355]   to his destructive agenda, right, his communist agenda for America.
[01:01:46.355 --> 01:01:52.034]   And so that's why they want Fetterman. And of course, there's been a lot of speculation about whether
[01:01:52.034 --> 01:01:57.394]   Fetterman will have to step down if he somehow does manage to win.
[01:01:57.468 --> 01:02:08.753]  And I say that in quotation marks because we do know from the report that you just shared on screen moments ago that they're already preparing to steal the election out of Pennsylvania just like they did in 2020.
[01:02:09.453 --> 01:02:14.396]  They're planning to have him step down and replace him immediately with his illegal alien wife.
[01:02:14.876 --> 01:02:17.439]  Who I believe is an illegal alien from Brazil.
[01:02:17.839 --> 01:02:27.487]  And so if you think that John Fetterman is radical, wait until he steps down due to his cognitive incompetence and they put his illegal alien wife in the position.
[01:02:28.168 --> 01:02:30.810]  So we have to make sure that that doesn't happen.
[01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:35.114]  But I did notice in that clip that nobody rushed to pick up the flags.
[01:02:35.154 --> 01:02:37.717]  I mean, that just shows you how much Democrats hate this country.
[01:02:38.397 --> 01:02:42.058]  Here, I was at a gala the other day, one of these political galas.
[01:02:42.078 --> 01:02:44.339]  There's a lot of political events, as you can imagine, right now.
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:47.961]  And the flag somehow tilted.
[01:02:48.481 --> 01:02:55.364]  And there were people willing to really nosedive toward the stage at this gala to make sure that that American flag didn't touch the ground.
[01:02:55.404 --> 01:02:58.925]  Because you're not supposed to allow for an American flag to touch the ground.
[01:02:59.305 --> 01:03:03.967]  But you notice from that clip that not a single person rushed to pick up those flags.
[01:03:04.087 --> 01:03:07.190]  And let's be clear, Laura, we're not in a cult of the American flag.
[01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:09.952]  It's a beautiful flag, a beautiful country, the greatest in history.
[01:03:10.352 --> 01:03:14.375]  But it's respect for the veterans and the people that fought and died for it.
[01:03:14.435 --> 01:03:19.179]  It's a symbol of them, like grandma's ashes on the mantel or somebody's tombstone.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.002]  But beyond that, it is a symbol of sacrifice.
[01:03:23.443 --> 01:03:27.126]  And that's why we support it and honor it for those that fought and died for it.
[01:03:29.059 --> 01:03:42.739]  Absolutely, and you can see that clearly John Fetterman and the Democrats and his supporters and Barack Hussein Obama and everybody that came out to that rally to support Fetterman, they clearly don't have respect for what the American flag represents and stands for.
[01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:47.164]   So that's why I tell people It's really the lesser of two evils.
[01:03:47.224 --> 01:03:57.947]  I mean, I think that, and I say this as a two-time congressional candidate and America's first Republican who ran against a Democrat, right, in 2020 where I was endorsed by President Trump and he voted for me.
[01:03:58.307 --> 01:04:05.229]  And then again, right, against a rhino anti-Trump election denying zombie who is also cognitively unfit.
[01:04:05.289 --> 01:04:09.170]  And despite no establishment support, you almost beat him in the primary.
[01:04:09.490 --> 01:04:11.251]  You had a little bit of support, you don't want.
[01:04:11.932 --> 01:04:16.455]  Well, I do believe that I won, and the election is currently being contested right now.
[01:04:16.915 --> 01:04:25.520]  There's a lawsuit that's actually been filed, and you may have heard about the Democrat whistleblower in Orange County who came forward to talk about the massive ballot fraud that's happening in Orange County.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:25.660]  I did.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.522]  That's big news, and I want to talk about that now, but let me give people a prelude.
[01:04:29.102 --> 01:04:29.682]  What's coming up?
[01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:34.345]  You're involved with an amazing pack that I've known about for years that is producing some of the best ads.
[01:04:34.385 --> 01:04:35.446]  You help produce these ads.
[01:04:35.486 --> 01:04:36.066]  They are amazing.
[01:04:36.086 --> 01:04:36.967]  They're going super viral.
[01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:38.428]  We're going to air them next segment.
[01:04:38.448 --> 01:04:40.369]  We're going to air them all over the Infowars operation.
[01:04:40.809 --> 01:04:43.331]  They're just culture ads exposing really what the left's for.
[01:04:43.371 --> 01:04:44.331]  We'll talk about those.
[01:04:44.751 --> 01:04:48.153]  We'll also play Joy Reid in one of the most amazing gaslighting videos yet.
[01:04:48.494 --> 01:04:51.655]  You've probably seen it, Laura, where she says inflation doesn't exist.
[01:04:51.715 --> 01:04:53.016]  It's a made up word.
[01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:55.498]  Another word that should be banned.
[01:04:55.858 --> 01:04:57.479]  Did you know inflation isn't real, Laura?
[01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:00.247]  I don't know.
[01:05:00.267 --> 01:05:13.094]  I guess all I hear these days is how the Democrats want to gaslight us about being election deniers, but it turns out all these people are inflation deniers and crime deniers and baby killing deniers and pedophilia deniers.
[01:05:13.114 --> 01:05:16.056]  They're not pedophilia deniers, they now endorse it.
[01:05:16.096 --> 01:05:17.977]  But you're right, they are deniers.
[01:05:18.197 --> 01:05:21.819]  Oh yeah, the talking point by all Hocho, all of them, is the crime's down!
[01:05:21.859 --> 01:05:22.760]  You didn't know that, Laura?
[01:05:23.881 --> 01:05:24.422]  Exactly.
[01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:28.866]  And so I say that if they're going to call us election deniers, because we know, right?
[01:05:28.946 --> 01:05:32.269]  Everybody with a brain knows that the 2020 election was stolen.
[01:05:32.790 --> 01:05:33.530]  Even Democrats.
[01:05:33.550 --> 01:05:37.694]  I mean, you're going to tell me that Joe Biden received more votes than Barack Hussein Obama?
[01:05:37.774 --> 01:05:38.395]  I don't think so.
[01:05:38.875 --> 01:05:50.165]  And so even Democrats should find this this claim right that Joe Biden received the most votes out of anybody in US history offensive because it's an insult to grassroots movements.
[01:05:50.265 --> 01:05:59.170]   And even though I cannot stand Barack Hussein Obama and anything that he represents he still has He did win those elections because they ran ringers against him, McCain and Romney.
[01:05:59.530 --> 01:05:59.950]  Stay there.
[01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:09.292]  We'll come back because it gets into election fraud, how it works, that big case in Florida that you've actually been covering and are actually connected to, exposing, with the Democrat coming out admitting the fraud.
[01:06:09.652 --> 01:06:15.833]  And then I want to get to the Joy Reid clip and I want to get to these ads that are going viral, really exposing these people.
[01:06:15.873 --> 01:06:16.333]  Laura Loomer.
[01:06:17.354 --> 01:06:19.134]  Laura, is the best site Loomer.com?
[01:06:20.805 --> 01:06:22.266]  Yeah, Lumared.com.
[01:06:22.366 --> 01:06:26.708]  And then for people, when you show the ads, you can go to AmericanLibertyFund.com.
[01:06:26.748 --> 01:06:36.372]  That's where people can support the work that we're doing over these next crucial two days, because my team and I are creating amazing ads, and we want to air these on television across the nation.
[01:06:36.432 --> 01:06:38.793]  So you'll get to see them when we return from the break.
[01:06:38.973 --> 01:06:41.234]  We've already gone megaviral, so you've already won.
[01:06:41.634 --> 01:06:42.855]  We've got to make them go more viral.
[01:06:42.675 --> 01:06:59.275]  Stay with us.
[01:06:59.385 --> 01:07:01.767]  The midterms are in 34 hours from now.
[01:07:02.027 --> 01:07:03.488]  East Coast time kicking off.
[01:07:04.468 --> 01:07:10.809]  Okay, we're not like corporate media, where they go, Jones says he loves Hitler.
[01:07:11.009 --> 01:07:11.830]  They don't show the clip.
[01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:12.370]  Not true.
[01:07:12.850 --> 01:07:14.250]  Or, Jones says this and that.
[01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:14.910]  Don't show the clip.
[01:07:14.930 --> 01:07:15.350]  They're lying.
[01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:18.831]  We tell you Joy Reid's gaslighting about inflation.
[01:07:18.891 --> 01:07:19.691]  It's a talking point.
[01:07:20.211 --> 01:07:27.953]  It's not important if one of them just said something like this, but they're all over the news saying Republicans want to put you in a death camp and kill your children.
[01:07:28.573 --> 01:07:29.893]  On Friday, I played some of those clips.
[01:07:31.761 --> 01:07:37.554]  And it's the same talking point that, oh, inflation's just some fancy Republican term.
[01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:41.703]  You wouldn't know it if they weren't using it to control you, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:43.482 --> 01:07:46.544]  We all learned about inflation in our first economics class, at least I did.
[01:07:47.044 --> 01:07:48.264]  I think they teach everywhere else, don't they?
[01:07:48.645 --> 01:07:50.406]  About overprinting money.
[01:07:50.446 --> 01:07:54.488]  You learn about the Weimar Republic, or in recent years you learn about Zimbabwe.
[01:07:55.008 --> 01:07:58.710]  Or you learn about Mexico, where they devalued their peso in the early 1990s.
[01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:07.794]  It helps the rich people who get the use of the money printing first, then they pass it on to the middle class and the poor people, and the middle class gets a lot smaller.
[01:08:07.894 --> 01:08:10.230]   It is a tool of War.
[01:08:10.471 --> 01:08:23.742]  If you look at Brazil, or you look at Argentina, or you look at Costa Rica, or you look at Venezuela, all those countries until the 60s and 70s were richer per capita than the average American.
[01:08:24.923 --> 01:08:31.489]  And then their governments devalued their currencies with the IMF and World Bank, and now they're hellholes in many areas.
[01:08:32.628 --> 01:08:33.189]  Very sad.
[01:08:33.649 --> 01:08:34.971]  I'd love to be able to live wherever.
[01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:36.112]  Brazil's gorgeous.
[01:08:36.192 --> 01:08:36.933]  Mexico's gorgeous.
[01:08:37.433 --> 01:08:40.556]  Sorry their governments did what our government's now doing.
[01:08:40.997 --> 01:08:46.242]  We point our finger at Mexico and go, oh look at you people, and you know, our dollar buys ten times what yours does.
[01:08:46.423 --> 01:08:47.384]  Not very long.
[01:08:48.203 --> 01:09:01.627]  Because what they did in Mexico, they're now doing to us, and it is, I just got a chill of anger, it is robbery of people's social security and their whole future and businesses and savings, and it is so destructive.
[01:09:01.887 --> 01:09:16.052]   So here she is saying price increases driven by devaluation of currency is a made-up fancy term by the Republicans, where if she was honest, She'd say, the Republicans have been part of this too.
[01:09:16.072 --> 01:09:20.015]  I mean, the Republicans drive the car of inflation at about 65 miles an hour.
[01:09:20.135 --> 01:09:20.615]  That's wrong.
[01:09:21.556 --> 01:09:23.797]  Biden's been driving at about 400 miles an hour.
[01:09:25.298 --> 01:09:26.779]  So there's the difference.
[01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:27.960]  It's been really bad.
[01:09:29.161 --> 01:09:32.083]  And look, you can have inflation if your country dominates the world.
[01:09:33.524 --> 01:09:36.547]  Because then your prices still don't go up, even though your currency's been inflated.
[01:09:36.807 --> 01:09:38.129]  And Trump tried that gamble.
[01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:39.330]  Everybody was coming back here.
[01:09:39.370 --> 01:09:40.311]  He went along with some of it.
[01:09:40.751 --> 01:09:46.837]  But Biden's created, now it's 56% of the money in history in less than two years.
[01:09:47.198 --> 01:09:47.818]  I'm gonna say that again.
[01:09:48.139 --> 01:09:59.338]   From 1776, really 1789 when it was official, from 1789 until January 2001, only 40-something
[01:09:59.338 --> 01:10:00.378]  percent of the money was created.
[01:10:00.422 --> 01:10:04.905]  Now it's 50-plus percent has been created in less than two years, 20-21 months.
[01:10:05.445 --> 01:10:14.511]  So in 21-22 months, 50-plus percent of the money in history of the country has been created, and then you wonder why your prices are exploded.
[01:10:14.971 --> 01:10:17.493]  By the way, most suppliers don't try to increase prices.
[01:10:17.553 --> 01:10:22.517]  We haven't, even though it's killing us, because you just don't want to do it, because your listeners, you can't pay it!
[01:10:23.337 --> 01:10:25.079]  And that's the line we're at.
[01:10:25.099 --> 01:10:29.263]  We're about to have to go up on prices, so everything's exploding because we can't buy it anymore.
[01:10:29.844 --> 01:10:33.788]  I had my main accountant tell me on Thursday, they said, you can't offer 60% off on that.
[01:10:34.729 --> 01:10:35.970]  They said, you lose money at that.
[01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:37.872]  So I went, OK, well, what products can I?
[01:10:37.892 --> 01:10:40.494]  Well, these and these, you're still making 10% on that.
[01:10:40.815 --> 01:10:42.356]  These other products, you're losing money at 60.
[01:10:43.584 --> 01:10:47.765]  So when you see the news, Jones grossed $60 million this year.
[01:10:48.505 --> 01:10:52.646]  Well, yeah, and we sell stuff mainly at sale, so we're operating on $20 million.
[01:10:53.286 --> 01:10:57.166]  That's the whole point, ladies and gentlemen, and that's what they're manipulating out there.
[01:10:57.206 --> 01:11:00.567]  And so if you run a business or you live in the real world, you know how bad this is.
[01:11:00.907 --> 01:11:03.588]  It hasn't gotten to the general public that's employed yet.
[01:11:03.968 --> 01:11:04.628]  I know I'm ranting.
[01:11:04.648 --> 01:11:08.268]  We'll get Laura Loomer's take on this in a moment, get to her amazing pack ad she's running nationwide.
[01:11:08.649 --> 01:11:10.829]  But here is the clip I was talking about.
[01:11:11.817 --> 01:11:18.203]  The only people I ever hear use the word inflation are journalists and economists, right?
[01:11:18.263 --> 01:11:22.507]  So that is not part of the normal lexicon of the way people talk.
[01:11:22.807 --> 01:11:26.090]  So it's interesting that Republicans are doing something they don't normally do, right?
[01:11:26.151 --> 01:11:28.833]  Which is not use the common tongue, right?
[01:11:28.853 --> 01:11:32.196]  Not use just common English to sort of do on their campaigns like they're doing with Prime.
[01:11:32.817 --> 01:11:35.900]  But what they've done is they've taught people the word inflation, right?
[01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:40.761]  Most people who have never used that word ever in their lives are using it now because they've been taught it.
[01:11:41.241 --> 01:11:45.742]  Including on TV, including in newspapers, they've been taught this word.
[01:11:46.082 --> 01:11:50.003]  And they sort of wrap this word around whatever it is that they really want to vote.
[01:11:50.383 --> 01:11:51.964]  You know, the reasons they really want to vote.
[01:11:52.524 --> 01:11:53.524]  You know where they've been taught it?
[01:11:53.604 --> 01:11:58.985]  When Trump left office, the average cost of premium 93 octane was $2.32.
[01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:09.392]  Diesel was even less, and now diesel's over $5, and the national average is almost $4 for 93 octane.
[01:12:10.712 --> 01:12:12.513]  Some areas it's $7, $8.
[01:12:12.993 --> 01:12:13.513]  You've seen that.
[01:12:13.773 --> 01:12:15.033]  Diesel's up to $9 in some areas.
[01:12:15.093 --> 01:12:22.335]  So, what teaches people about inflation is when they used to fill their car for $50, and now it costs $100.
[01:12:23.275 --> 01:12:28.017]   When they used to buy a package of bacon for $3, And now it costs $7.
[01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:31.398]  Well, they used to buy a four-pack of yogurt, because I do a lot of the shopping.
[01:12:31.918 --> 01:12:33.199]  I used to buy that for $3.
[01:12:33.259 --> 01:12:33.539]  Now it's $8.
[01:12:33.799 --> 01:12:36.320]  Well, I used to buy a gallon of milk for $2.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:36.640]  Now it's $5.
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:39.201]  Well, I used to buy a carton of egg for $3.
[01:12:39.241 --> 01:12:39.521]  Now it's $7.
[01:12:39.701 --> 01:12:42.983]  Well, I used to buy a thing of ham for $3.
[01:12:43.043 --> 01:12:43.263]  Now it's $10.
[01:12:43.303 --> 01:12:46.004]  Well, you know, you know, no, no, no.
[01:12:46.064 --> 01:12:50.886]  We know when I used to go to a steakhouse and a delicious steak was $25.
[01:12:51.206 --> 01:12:51.466]  Now it's $50.
[01:12:51.986 --> 01:12:56.068]  Laura, we're being taught inflation by being beat over the head with it, aren't we?
[01:12:58.599 --> 01:12:59.640]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:09.587]  And it just goes to show you, too, how the Democrat Party, you know, they just have so much disdain and contempt for the average American voter or American citizen.
[01:13:09.607 --> 01:13:12.009]  They really honestly think that people are stupid.
[01:13:12.069 --> 01:13:14.751]  They think that we're a bunch of brain-dead minions.
[01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:29.328]  And that, you know, we just need to sit back and be quiet because we don't know what's good for us and we just have to listen to the pundits on CNN and MSNBC tell us what we need to know and we don't need to know anything else except for what they tell us we need to know.
[01:13:30.069 --> 01:13:31.371]  And so it's very insulting.
[01:13:31.891 --> 01:13:41.963]  I think I saw another clip the other day, I forget, and I can't recall which pundit it was who said it, but they said the same thing that Joy Re said, but they were talking about the black community.
[01:13:42.264 --> 01:13:45.287]  They said that black people do not know what inflation is.
[01:13:46.068 --> 01:13:50.393]  And so they're insulting their traditional voting base.
[01:13:50.673 --> 01:13:56.358]  You're seeing a shift in black voters and Hispanic voters move from the Democrat Party over to the Republican Party.
[01:13:56.839 --> 01:14:04.707]  And now we're seeing how the Democrat Party truly feels about minorities who have traditionally voted Democrat.
[01:14:04.727 --> 01:14:06.969]  They really honestly think these people are stupid.
[01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:23.972]   But I'm glad that they're saying it because it's It's good for people to hear it out in the open, to understand what the Democrat Party thinks of them, so that they know to get off the Democrat Party plantation and start voting for policies and voting for America First candidates that are actually going to put them and their families in their best interests.
[01:14:24.482 --> 01:14:26.703]  Wasn't this a Marie Antoinette quote?
[01:14:27.264 --> 01:14:31.406]  Because nobody knows what Marie Antoinette actually said when they were hundreds of thousands starving to death in Paris.
[01:14:31.426 --> 01:14:33.167]  And they said, please open up the grain reserves.
[01:14:33.207 --> 01:14:33.748]  We're starving to death.
[01:14:33.768 --> 01:14:34.468]  The children are dying.
[01:14:34.768 --> 01:14:35.709]  She said, let them eat cake.
[01:14:35.729 --> 01:14:36.589]  We don't know if she said that.
[01:14:36.869 --> 01:14:38.590]  But Joy Reid just said, let them eat cake.
[01:14:38.630 --> 01:14:40.191]  She said, this doesn't exist.
[01:14:40.251 --> 01:14:42.393]  They taught them price increases.
[01:14:42.713 --> 01:14:43.493]  Nobody's heard.
[01:14:43.774 --> 01:14:45.955]  That is such a disconnected, evil statement.
[01:14:48.004 --> 01:14:50.225]  Well, that's why the Democrats should lose.
[01:14:50.265 --> 01:14:52.285]  That's why there should be a massive red wave.
[01:14:52.706 --> 01:14:56.527]  That's why, you know, there should have been a massive red wave in 2020 as well.
[01:14:57.307 --> 01:15:02.969]  But that's why, of course, we see the Democrats, the only way they can quote-unquote win is by cheating.
[01:15:03.549 --> 01:15:09.091]  This is the same messaging that was pushed out in 2020, except with regards to crime.
[01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:12.392]  We had Black Lives Matter in Antifa destroying our cities.
[01:15:12.452 --> 01:15:16.453]   They told us, you don't know what violence violence, crime is you don't know what domestic terrorism
[01:15:16.453 --> 01:15:21.803]   is that's a peaceful protest and now right they've used that same argument that same logic
[01:15:21.803 --> 01:15:26.392]   but applied it to our economy when many Americans are going without three meals a day
[01:15:26.392 --> 01:15:31.802]   because so many people are struggling even if you're making over $70,000 a year I was watching a
[01:15:31.802 --> 01:15:37.263]   report out of New York the other day New York families making 70 to $80,000 per year
[01:15:37.263 --> 01:15:41.583]   are living paycheck to paycheck and are having to make tough decisions about whether whether
[01:15:41.583 --> 01:15:45.843]   they put food on the table for their kids or more gas in their cars because the price of
[01:15:45.843 --> 01:15:51.092]   everything goes up which of course diminishes your overall yearly annual salary.
[01:15:51.063 --> 01:16:01.647]  So everybody's, you know, feeling the pain at the pump and is truly experiencing and seeing inflation in real time when they watch their bank accounts get destroyed.
[01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:04.908]  What was the exact quote of Biden a month ago with an ice cream cone in his hand?
[01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:07.730]  He said, we have an incredibly strong economy.
[01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:08.350]  What was the quote?
[01:16:12.072 --> 01:16:13.392]  I don't know what the quote was.
[01:16:13.412 --> 01:16:14.633]  You'll have to pull up the video.
[01:16:15.633 --> 01:16:16.253]  Yeah, Biden.
[01:16:16.333 --> 01:16:19.335]  We'll be right back.
[01:16:19.395 --> 01:16:22.696]  Biden said the economy was strong as hell.
[01:16:25.778 --> 01:16:26.318]  Here it is.
[01:16:28.032 --> 01:16:32.796]  Are you concerned about the strength of the dollar right now?
[01:16:35.599 --> 01:16:39.722]  I'm not concerned about the strength of the dollar.
[01:16:39.822 --> 01:16:42.745]  I'm concerned about the rest of the world.
[01:16:42.785 --> 01:16:44.626]  Does that make sense?
[01:16:45.007 --> 01:16:45.267]  Yes.
[01:16:45.407 --> 01:16:47.148]  Our economy is strong as hell.
[01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:49.010]  In the internal zone.
[01:16:50.274 --> 01:17:03.682]  That's a talking point.
[01:17:03.922 --> 01:17:09.505]  So when Kirby got asked that question, he's now over at the White House helping out.
[01:17:09.525 --> 01:17:10.165]  He said the same thing.
[01:17:10.466 --> 01:17:11.686]  Oh, we don't care about America.
[01:17:11.706 --> 01:17:13.347]  We care about Ukraine.
[01:17:14.748 --> 01:17:16.789]  Laura Loomer is our guest.
[01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:22.496]   Dr. Pierre McCullough in studio coming up in our Three and four tonight.
[01:17:22.516 --> 01:17:23.317]  There's a big article.
[01:17:23.397 --> 01:17:28.579]  He just exposes who's behind the COVID, who's behind the shots.
[01:17:29.159 --> 01:17:30.400]  This is going to be a big interview.
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:31.400]  The gloves are off.
[01:17:32.421 --> 01:17:34.782]  Laura, get into this pack you're involved with.
[01:17:35.822 --> 01:17:36.622]  I've seen its work before.
[01:17:36.662 --> 01:17:37.283]  It's great stuff.
[01:17:37.883 --> 01:17:45.286]  And then, Previs, do you want to go to the COVID ads that you cut, that you made for the pack, or do you want to get to the PETA one first, showing who the Democrats are?
[01:17:46.732 --> 01:17:47.713]  Well, we can show both of them.
[01:17:47.733 --> 01:17:50.037]  Let's start with the groomer ad, the pedophile ad.
[01:17:50.577 --> 01:17:57.567]  But yeah, after my campaign ended, I was actually invited to come work with a PAC called American Liberty Fund.
[01:17:57.587 --> 01:18:02.715]  And American Liberty Fund is a PAC that is focused on supporting pro-liberty candidates.
[01:18:02.955 --> 01:18:06.916]  Candidates that are focused on preserving our freedoms and our liberties.
[01:18:07.017 --> 01:18:12.458]  And you see that political messaging in the Republican Party is very weak.
[01:18:12.819 --> 01:18:32.026]   And even though these issues of sexualization of our children and people dying from vaccine injuries and the death shot and children getting myocarditis are in the news, Thanks to people like you and grassroots independent media every single day, you see so many Republican and even so-called America First candidates.
[01:18:32.326 --> 01:18:37.288]  And I say that, of course, because not everybody who calls themselves America First actually is America First.
[01:18:37.889 --> 01:18:39.829]  They refuse to talk about these issues.
[01:18:40.170 --> 01:18:43.791]  And so we decided to actually create advertisements.
[01:18:43.831 --> 01:18:53.300]   My team and I, Norman, who does incredible animations, and then Shane Corey, who is the founder of the PAC, And Laura, Laura, where do people find the ads?
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:57.309]  We're about to play and people can clip out of the show and play them, but to find them in better quality before...
[01:18:58.228 --> 01:18:59.849]  Yeah, American Liberty Fund.
[01:18:59.869 --> 01:19:02.150]  That's AmericanLibertyFund.com.
[01:19:02.210 --> 01:19:07.132]  And then you can also find them on my telegram and my account.
[01:19:07.152 --> 01:19:08.932]  AmericanLibertyFund.com.
[01:19:09.112 --> 01:19:09.793]  Let's just do this.
[01:19:10.533 --> 01:19:12.874]  There's two Poison Vax ads.
[01:19:13.354 --> 01:19:14.875]  We'll play those secondary back-to-back.
[01:19:15.215 --> 01:19:16.055]  Play them all back-to-back.
[01:19:16.415 --> 01:19:18.216]  Here is the Anti-Pedo ad.
[01:19:18.556 --> 01:19:24.679]  This book that you expose is at the Austin Library for Middle School and High Schoolers.
[01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:26.739]  This is all over the country.
[01:19:27.039 --> 01:19:28.340]  There are hundreds of these type books.
[01:19:28.380 --> 01:19:31.160]  We've reviewed more than 50 of them here.
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:33.061]  And let me tell you, I've been scarred by looking at it.
[01:19:33.101 --> 01:19:34.281]  I can't imagine children looking at it.
[01:19:35.261 --> 01:19:38.262]  It's kids being picked up by pedophiles and loving it.
[01:19:38.642 --> 01:19:40.302]  Training kids to get in vans with men.
[01:19:40.322 --> 01:19:41.582]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[01:19:42.463 --> 01:19:44.403]  Put something into your v*****.
[01:19:45.383 --> 01:19:46.423]  Not even a fuck**.
[01:19:47.984 --> 01:19:50.224]  So you've never fuck** yourself?
[01:19:51.584 --> 01:19:54.225]  As a teen, I got bored of fuck**.
[01:19:56.030 --> 01:20:00.593]  I then dreamed about having a massive p***ful p*** that lasted all day.
[01:20:00.833 --> 01:20:03.935]  Do you feel sad that you weren't born with a dick?
[01:20:04.896 --> 01:20:07.938]  These are exact excerpts from the book Genderqueer.
[01:20:08.558 --> 01:20:10.940]  This book is being taught to public school children.
[01:20:12.003 --> 01:20:13.824]  America, we have a problem.
[01:20:14.365 --> 01:20:18.487]  On November 8th, vote to stop the sexualization of your kids.
[01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:20.108]  Vote Republican.
[01:20:20.588 --> 01:20:22.149]  Paid for by American Liberty Fund.
[01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:24.491]  Not authorized by any candidate or candidate committee.
[01:20:24.511 --> 01:20:27.433]  Alright, here's two of the ads exposing the death shot.
[01:20:28.356 --> 01:20:30.857]  Mommy, I don't want to get it.
[01:20:31.257 --> 01:20:33.697]  Mommy, I'm not sick.
[01:20:33.717 --> 01:20:34.557]  Mommy, please.
[01:20:34.577 --> 01:20:35.158]  I'm scared.
[01:20:35.838 --> 01:20:36.818]  I'm sorry, baby.
[01:20:37.418 --> 01:20:38.498]  I wish I had a choice.
[01:20:38.958 --> 01:20:43.340]  The CDC is recommending the COVID-19 vaccine for all school children.
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:49.421]  If Democrat Kathy Hochul gets elected as governor of New York, you may no longer have a say in your child's health.
[01:20:49.721 --> 01:20:51.942]  On November 8th, vote for parental rights.
[01:20:52.362 --> 01:20:53.442]  Vote Republican.
[01:20:53.682 --> 01:20:55.262]  Paid for by American Liberty Fund.
[01:20:55.422 --> 01:20:57.903]  Not authorized by any candidate or candidates committee.
[01:20:58.344 --> 01:21:00.050]  Mommy, I don't want to get it.
[01:21:00.070 --> 01:21:01.978]  Mommy, I'm not sick!
[01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:04.021]  Mommy, please!
[01:21:04.201 --> 01:21:05.182]  I'm scared!
[01:21:05.942 --> 01:21:06.922]  I'm sorry, baby.
[01:21:07.022 --> 01:21:08.623]  I wish I had a choice.
[01:21:08.863 --> 01:21:13.425]  The CDC is recommending the COVID-19 vaccine for all school children.
[01:21:13.725 --> 01:21:19.487]  If Democrat Josh Shapiro gets elected as governor of Pennsylvania, you may no longer have a say in your child's health.
[01:21:19.807 --> 01:21:22.048]  On November 8th, vote for parental rights.
[01:21:22.468 --> 01:21:23.508]  Vote Republican.
[01:21:23.768 --> 01:21:25.329]  Paid for by American Liberty Fund.
[01:21:25.509 --> 01:21:27.930]  Not authorized by any candidate or candidates committee.
[01:21:28.590 --> 01:21:33.254]  And again, that means it's an independent PAC can do whatever it wants, and that's the beauty of these, to be able to warn people.
[01:21:33.314 --> 01:21:40.400]  I want to see some ads, too, about the U.N., about censorship, about all these different organizations, Laura Loehmer.
[01:21:41.901 --> 01:21:49.908]  In closing here, because I've got some final news after you leave us, what else do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners of this broadcast on pretty much the eve of the election?
[01:21:51.621 --> 01:22:04.357]  Well, I appreciate you airing these ads, Alex, and I just want to let people know that American Liberty Fund and these ads that I've been writing and producing with my team, this is the tip of the spear of what political messaging needs to be on the right.
[01:22:04.437 --> 01:22:08.162]  And so I look forward to creating more of these powerful ads with my team, Alex.
[01:22:08.562 --> 01:22:20.247]  Especially regarding these issues that you just highlighted, election integrity, a lot of things, the World Economic Forum, more vaccine injury ads, censorship, big tech tyranny.
[01:22:20.267 --> 01:22:23.728]  You're going to see a lot more from American Liberty Fund.
[01:22:24.269 --> 01:22:26.830]  But I just want everybody to be vigilant and aware.
[01:22:26.850 --> 01:22:30.771]  If you're going and voting at the polls, keep your eyes open.
[01:22:30.811 --> 01:22:37.654]  If you see any fraud, make sure you record it and you report it to your local sheriff because the Republican Party, they're not coming to save you.
[01:22:37.654 --> 01:22:37.974]  Thank you.
[01:22:37.994 --> 01:22:43.098]  Okay, the Republican Party was just as guilty as the Democrat Party in stealing the 2020 election.
[01:22:43.438 --> 01:22:46.801]  They had no election day, ground day operations in 2020.
[01:22:47.502 --> 01:22:55.208]  And I doubt that they're going to have strong election grounding operations this year to prevent fraud on election day.
[01:22:55.248 --> 01:22:58.690]  And so if you want your vote to count, you're going to have to be out there yourself.
[01:22:58.730 --> 01:23:04.555]  You're going to have to volunteer as a poll watcher, poll worker, and really keep your eyes open because it's a unit party.
[01:23:04.935 --> 01:23:10.338]  And regardless of which party is in control, you know, I personally, I don't really see much of a difference.
[01:23:10.458 --> 01:23:31.231]  Obviously, I'm rooting for Republicans to win and take back the House, but with the likelihood of Kevin McCarthy potentially being Speaker of the House and a lot of candidates making deals with him behind the scenes and not really having the balls or the testicular fortitude, as I say, to campaign openly, right, against the McCarthy speakership, which would be worse than Paul Ryan.
[01:23:31.251 --> 01:23:34.433]  We're talking about Paul Ryan on steroids times a million.
[01:23:34.893 --> 01:23:37.975]  That's what you're gonna get with Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House.
[01:23:37.995 --> 01:23:38.375]  Absolutely.
[01:23:38.415 --> 01:23:40.096]  Laura Lummer, we'll talk to you on election night.
[01:23:40.116 --> 01:23:40.836]  Thank you so much.
[01:23:40.856 --> 01:23:42.978]  Alright, let me just say this right here.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:54.922]  I agree with her that the unit party is there, but there's a beachhead with Republicans, Trumpites, Patriots, and whether you believe it or not, he's acting like a super patriot because he's making him popular.
[01:23:55.382 --> 01:24:00.663]  And so we're taking control of the party with great folks that are out there in the grassroots fighting like Laura Loomer.
[01:24:00.903 --> 01:24:01.924]  We're going to go to break here.
[01:24:02.504 --> 01:24:03.884]  Dr. Peter McCullough is coming in.
[01:24:04.004 --> 01:24:05.905]  Two hour powerful interview.
[01:24:06.185 --> 01:24:07.185]  He's taking the gloves off.
[01:24:07.205 --> 01:24:08.585]  You don't want to miss this information.
[01:24:08.605 --> 01:24:10.685]  But let me hit these stories here that I forgot to get to.
[01:24:11.066 --> 01:24:12.906]  I'll cover more tomorrow on my regular weekday show.
[01:24:14.218 --> 01:24:14.578]  Report!
[01:24:14.638 --> 01:24:19.561]  Pedophiles can exploit trans loophole tied to criminal history when applying to work with children.
[01:24:20.022 --> 01:24:24.144]  In the UK, London Telegraph reports, and in the United States, it's the same.
[01:24:24.665 --> 01:24:28.087]  It's men dressed up like women trying to get access to your children.
[01:24:28.527 --> 01:24:30.408]  And as I started the show, this is really important.
[01:24:30.468 --> 01:24:32.750]  Shock poll put on by the Democratic Party.
[01:24:33.230 --> 01:24:42.536]  Nearly half of American voters, 50 plus percent of Republicans, 40 plus percent of Independents, 30 plus percent of Democrats believe a shadow criminal group is running America.
[01:24:42.916 --> 01:24:44.237]  That is extremely important.
[01:24:44.497 --> 01:24:47.940]  37% of Democrats, 41% of Independents, 53% of Republicans.
[01:24:49.441 --> 01:24:50.682]  A total of 44%.
[01:24:50.882 --> 01:24:52.504]  We have been doing our job.
[01:24:52.644 --> 01:24:55.266]  You've been doing your job and doing an incredible job.
[01:24:55.726 --> 01:25:01.171]  We are going to take the German government study, the Swedish government study, the U.S.
[01:25:01.191 --> 01:25:04.894]  government studies, showing the almost exact same numbers.
[01:25:04.914 --> 01:25:10.038]  3,600 plus percent increase in stillbirths, miscarriages, in the vaccinated.
[01:25:11.226 --> 01:25:12.226]  That's the biggest in history.
[01:25:12.246 --> 01:25:19.849]  As soon as this broadcast, this live part ends, I'm gonna go make sure that gets cut out and put on the front page of Bandai Video.
[01:25:20.109 --> 01:25:21.749]  We're gonna save a lot of children a lot of lives.
[01:25:21.769 --> 01:25:25.230]  They want abortion, but they can't get the average mother to kill their child.
[01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:26.431]  This is abortion.
[01:25:26.771 --> 01:25:27.871]  This is forced abortion.
[01:25:28.811 --> 01:25:30.032]  This is one-child policy.
[01:25:30.892 --> 01:25:33.073]  Also, we're fearless.
[01:25:33.333 --> 01:25:34.193]  We're fighting for you.
[01:25:34.233 --> 01:25:35.594]  We're fighting for our shared destiny.
[01:25:35.854 --> 01:25:36.754]  We'll never back down.
[01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:39.300]  We'll never give up, but we can give out.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.140]  We need financial support.
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:46.082]  So go to InfoWars.com forward slash crypto, whether it's $5 in crypto or $1,000.
