[00:00:04.454 --> 00:00:08.898]  Well, Anthony Fauci promised you if you got the vaccine, you'd be protected from COVID.
[00:00:08.918 --> 00:00:09.718]  You wouldn't get COVID.
[00:00:09.738 --> 00:00:10.319]  He said that.
[00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.884]  Well, now four times injected with the clotshot, he claims, Fauci has COVID.
[00:00:18.045 --> 00:00:25.250]  But he seems to be well enough to at least show up for a hearing, a congressional hearing, even though he is remote.
[00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:31.795]  And Rand Paul was giving him the what-for on why they're trying to force children to take this deadly vaccine.
[00:00:32.236 --> 00:00:33.477]  Here's how that went.
[00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.892]  Are you aware of any studies that show reduction in hospitalization or death for children who take a booster?
[00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:48.596]  Right now, there's not enough data that has been accumulated, Senator Paul, to indicate that that's the case.
[00:00:49.336 --> 00:01:15.145]   I believe that the recommendation that was made was based on the assumption that if you look at the morbidity and mortality of children within each of the age groups, you know, 0 to 5, 5 to 11, So there are no studies, and Americans should all know this, there are no studies on children showing a reduction in hospitalization or death with taking a booster.
[00:01:15.705 --> 00:01:21.286]  The only studies that were permitted, the only studies that were presented, were antibody studies.
[00:01:21.786 --> 00:01:24.507]  So they say if we give you a booster you make antibodies.
[00:01:25.407 --> 00:01:30.090]  Now, a lot of scientists would question whether or not that's proof of efficacy of a vaccine.
[00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:42.257]  If I give you 10, or if I give a patient 10 mRNA vaccines, and they make protein each time, or they make antibody each time, is that proof that we should give 10 boosters, Dr. Fauci?
[00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.613]  No, I think that is somewhat of an absurd exaggeration.
[00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:49.895]  Well, that is the proof that you use.
[00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:51.597]  Your committees use that.
[00:01:51.657 --> 00:01:55.942]  That's the only proof you have to tell children to take a booster is that they make antibodies.
[00:01:56.242 --> 00:01:57.583]  So it's not an absurdity.
[00:01:57.864 --> 00:02:00.266]  You're already at like five boosters for people.
[00:02:00.306 --> 00:02:02.428]  You've had, you know, two or three boosters.
[00:02:02.508 --> 00:02:04.450]  It's like, where is the proof?
[00:02:05.211 --> 00:02:09.234]  Now I think there is probably some indication for older folks that have some risk factors.
[00:02:09.554 --> 00:02:11.016]  For younger folks, there's not.
[00:02:11.356 --> 00:02:12.477]  But here's the other thing.
[00:02:12.717 --> 00:02:15.459]  There are some risk factors for the vaccine.
[00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:22.084]  So the risk of myocarditis with a second dose for adolescent boys, 12 to 24, is about 80 in a million.
[00:02:22.845 --> 00:02:25.987]  This is both from the CDC and from the Israeli study.
[00:02:26.507 --> 00:02:27.888]  It's also in the VAER study.
[00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:29.049]  Remarkably similar.
[00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.790]  Four boys.
[00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.072]  Much higher from boys than girls and much higher than the background.
[00:02:33.092 --> 00:02:34.333]  The background's about two.
[00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:35.835]  Per million.
[00:02:36.535 --> 00:02:46.544]  So there is risk and there are risks and you're telling everybody in America just blindly go out there because we made antibodies so it is not an absurd corollary to say if you have ten.
[00:02:46.905 --> 00:02:50.688]  In fact, you probably make antibodies if you get a hundred boosters.
[00:02:51.028 --> 00:02:51.449]  Alright?
[00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:57.074]  That's not science, that's conjecture and we should not be making public policy on it.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.820]  So, Senator Paul, if I might respond to that.
[00:03:01.621 --> 00:03:09.382]  We just heard, in his opening statement, Ranking Member Burr talk about his staff who went to Israel.
[00:03:10.082 --> 00:03:26.445]  And if you look at the data from Israel, the boosts, both the third shot boost and the fourth shot boost, was associated with a clear-cut clinical effect, mostly in elderly people, but also as they gathered more data, even in people in the 40s and the 50s.
[00:03:27.705 --> 00:03:30.188]  So there is clinical data, but not in children.
[00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:36.334]  Well, here's the thing is you're not willing to be honest with the American people.
[00:03:36.414 --> 00:03:39.797]  So for example, 75% of kids have had the disease.
[00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:43.141]  Why is the CDC not including this in the data?
[00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:44.542]  You can ask the question.
[00:03:44.743 --> 00:03:48.426]  You can do laboratory tests to find out who's had it and who hasn't had the disease.
[00:03:49.167 --> 00:03:57.071]  What is the incidence of hospitalization and death for children who've been infected with COVID, subsequently going to the hospital or dying?
[00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:05.735]  What is the possibility, if your kid has had COVID, which is 75% of the country's had COVID, what is the chance that my child's going to the hospital or dying?
[00:04:06.883 --> 00:04:11.724]  If you look at the number of deaths in pediatrics, Senator, you can see that there are more deaths.
[00:04:11.744 --> 00:04:12.945]  They have gone up since the vaccine.
[00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:19.166]  Okay, we're going to have more from Rand Paul and Anthony Fauci coming up later in the transmission.
[00:04:19.206 --> 00:04:21.046]  But you know what's really pathetic?
[00:04:22.427 --> 00:04:26.208]  That we're still talking about COVID like it's some sort of a massive health threat.
[00:04:26.808 --> 00:04:33.370]  The only discussion we should be having about COVID is why it was made in a lab and why those that made it aren't in jail right now.
[00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:52.649]  Now, that's what we should be asking Fauci.
[00:04:52.597 --> 00:05:02.262]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently... Alex Jones!
[00:05:02.282 --> 00:05:04.443]  Scum!
[00:05:04.663 --> 00:05:06.884]  Russian scum!
[00:05:11.588 --> 00:05:17.812]  Reputation's amazing.
[00:05:18.252 --> 00:05:19.613]  I will not let you down.
[00:05:19.733 --> 00:05:24.216]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:05:26.217 --> 00:05:28.059]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have found it.
[00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:31.861]  The heart of the resistance to the New World Order.
[00:05:33.022 --> 00:05:37.205]  The heart of the resistance to global government and tyranny.
[00:05:38.223 --> 00:05:49.827]  And it's right here on the Alex Jones Show at InfoWars.com and Band.Video on this Friday, June 17, 2022 live transmission.
[00:05:49.887 --> 00:05:51.908]  Owens-Royer still at the desk for Alex today.
[00:05:52.688 --> 00:05:55.729]  We may be hearing from Alex before the transmission is complete.
[00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.351]  We are expecting Alex to be back this weekend.
[00:06:00.391 --> 00:06:11.893]   He may be hosting Sunday, but certainly he will be back next week filling His host duties as he has for decades here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:11.973 --> 00:06:13.874]  So, one more day of me here.
[00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:22.817]  It's an honor and a privilege to be here with you today and I've got a loaded news desk and about 15 video clips here in front of me.
[00:06:22.877 --> 00:06:23.957]  Let's see what we have.
[00:06:24.217 --> 00:06:27.558]  We've got some news from the White House.
[00:06:27.758 --> 00:06:28.599]  It's not good.
[00:06:29.579 --> 00:06:31.900]  Biden is really a complete embarrassment.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.832]   So badly Embarrassing the Democrat Party now that they won't even endorse him for 2024.
[00:06:38.092 --> 00:06:52.301]  Of course, when Biden comes out and says, oh, I'm running in 2024, that's, that's just conjecture to continue propping himself up as a legitimate president, which he is not.
[00:06:53.382 --> 00:06:54.342]  Like, oh, of course I'm running.
[00:06:54.362 --> 00:06:55.343]  I'm so legitimate.
[00:06:55.363 --> 00:06:55.863]  81 million votes.
[00:06:55.903 --> 00:06:56.804]  Yeah.
[00:06:58.705 --> 00:06:58.905]  No.
[00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:01.047]  That's ridiculous.
[00:07:02.828 --> 00:07:05.319]   But No one will endorse him.
[00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:09.221]  Big leftist publications are basically urging him not to run.
[00:07:10.562 --> 00:07:11.943]  But that's really not even the issue.
[00:07:11.963 --> 00:07:14.464]  The issue is the economic devastation.
[00:07:15.665 --> 00:07:17.546]  And then what is Joe Biden doing about that?
[00:07:17.606 --> 00:07:22.629]  He's signing executive orders to make sure American children are gay.
[00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:25.771]  That's what Biden is concerned about today.
[00:07:25.831 --> 00:07:27.733]  We need more gay children.
[00:07:28.686 --> 00:07:34.890]  And we need to make sure that pedophiles have access to those kids because of diversita.
[00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.333]  So it's just ridiculous what's coming out of the White House today.
[00:07:42.374 --> 00:07:49.938]  But you have CEOs and others that are finally starting to push back publicly against this administration saying, hey look, no, you caused the inflation.
[00:07:50.178 --> 00:07:51.119]  Let's be clear here.
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:08:03.266]   This has nothing to do with corporate greed, nothing to do with big oil, And so now you have CEOs and other heads of the companies coming out and saying, look, this is Biden causing this disastrous economy.
[00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:04.587]  Don't put this on us.
[00:08:06.208 --> 00:08:13.174]  We really, I mean, most of these big, yeah, a lot of people made a lot of money during the fake pandemic, but also a lot of people haven't really recovered.
[00:08:13.194 --> 00:08:15.515]  A lot of industries took hits.
[00:08:16.476 --> 00:08:17.357]  Still reeling from it.
[00:08:20.236 --> 00:08:24.800]  And so then Biden comes out and points the finger, Democrats come out and point the finger, say, big corporate greed.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.202]  Well, they're finally standing up for themselves saying, uh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:08:28.222 --> 00:08:30.004]  This is Biden economic policy.
[00:08:30.044 --> 00:08:32.786]  This is Democrat economic policy, not corporate greed.
[00:08:35.128 --> 00:08:37.810]  But he's signing bills, uh, making sure kids are gay.
[00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:39.611]  So you've got that going on.
[00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.573]  So we'll have that news out of the White House.
[00:08:42.954 --> 00:08:47.538]  I do have some news regarding more geopolitical developments.
[00:08:49.298 --> 00:08:54.779]  With Ukraine and then now Syria back onto the map as an issue.
[00:08:55.719 --> 00:08:58.720]  And it looks like China is going to be going into Taiwan.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:05.161]  And it looks like that situation may be coming to the fore this summer.
[00:09:06.381 --> 00:09:07.861]  So we'll have some updates on that.
[00:09:08.801 --> 00:09:37.960]   A fake news fact checker just had to resign because after the USA Today audited Her stories, boy it's so funny, they give Infowars all this crap, and I won't go too deep into this rabbit hole, but let's just say, we have people constantly questioning our editorial standards, and we have to make these arguments in court.
[00:09:39.807 --> 00:09:46.168]  But then the USA Today has a fact-checker that had 23 articles that she completely made up.
[00:09:46.908 --> 00:09:48.109]  Completely fabricated.
[00:09:48.909 --> 00:10:00.851]  And then they do a quote-unquote audit of the stories, and it turns out they find out, yes indeed, all of her sources were fake, and her stories were fake, and this was a liberal fact-checker who wrote fake stories.
[00:10:04.111 --> 00:10:07.012]  I thought the USA Today would have higher standards!
[00:10:09.718 --> 00:10:11.359]  They audit the story after they publish it.
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:20.184]  Well, whatever, I'm not here to criticize whatever editorial standards USA Today has, but, uh, fact checker, fake news, it's another one.
[00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:23.726]  It's pretty standard now, par for the course.
[00:10:23.786 --> 00:10:27.189]  These, these fact checkers end up being the biggest liars you've ever heard of.
[00:10:28.589 --> 00:10:40.757]   Then, we've got some developments on the J6, January 6th narrative and Legal defense that is ongoing.
[00:10:42.318 --> 00:10:44.178]  So we'll have those updates for you today.
[00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:51.040]  I cannot get over what the Democrats are trying to do right now, infringing on our Second Amendment.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.040]  It's total treason.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:11:01.002]  But aside from the treasonous aspect of what they're doing, the... I don't even know what you would call it.
[00:11:01.022 --> 00:11:12.494]   I mean, double standard, logical, Inconsistencies, incongruities, it's impossible for someone to actually believe all the things liberals claim to believe.
[00:11:12.854 --> 00:11:15.234]  It is impossible.
[00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:19.315]  It has contradictory logic built into it.
[00:11:19.635 --> 00:11:20.895]  It cannot exist.
[00:11:21.816 --> 00:11:31.503]   So I just, I've got more stories here, what the Democrats are doing to violate your Second Amendment rights, and it's Nothing will stop the next school shooter, by the way.
[00:11:32.003 --> 00:11:36.084]  Everything that they're doing and proposing is not going to do a damn thing about stopping a school shooter.
[00:11:36.724 --> 00:11:38.164]  But they're still doing that.
[00:11:39.905 --> 00:11:40.705]  So we'll have that.
[00:11:41.725 --> 00:11:46.167]  We're gonna have more from Rand Paul and Anthony Fauci as well.
[00:11:47.887 --> 00:11:51.688]  As some other COVID and vaccine news that I have in front of my desk.
[00:11:52.568 --> 00:11:54.549]  We have some other election news.
[00:11:56.886 --> 00:11:59.007]  Have you been flying lately?
[00:11:59.808 --> 00:12:05.872]  You've probably seen or heard what a miserable experience flying is now.
[00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:10.455]  That's just more a sign of where the country is at, falling apart at the seams.
[00:12:10.495 --> 00:12:22.383]  Total cultural decay, societal decay, civilizational decay, and it can almost all be traced back to big government and liberalism and Democrat policy.
[00:12:22.463 --> 00:12:35.385]   Then you had an interesting story Inmate planned to strangle Ghislaine Maxwell in her sleep at Brooklyn Federal Jail according to her lawyer.
[00:12:36.545 --> 00:12:40.005]  So they wanted to Epstein Maxwell.
[00:12:40.666 --> 00:12:43.266]  They tried to Epstein Maxwell.
[00:12:43.966 --> 00:12:53.768]  And now the lawyer or the prosecution is trying to figure out who paid the woman or who offered to pay the woman.
[00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:58.013]  So that story is developing.
[00:12:58.414 --> 00:12:59.095]  Pretty interesting.
[00:13:00.276 --> 00:13:01.018]  Pretty interesting.
[00:13:01.458 --> 00:13:03.682]  Kind of just memory hold the whole Epstein thing.
[00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:38.445]   You know, the mainstream media, they're all friends with Epstein and they're all friends with the Clintons and the Democrats that used Epstein to hire sex workers and sex slaves so ABC News execs and others made sure to never report on the Epstein story, never report on the Maxwell story because it would It would hurt the Democrats, it would hurt the Clintons, and it would hurt themselves that we're all using Jeffrey Epstein's sex slaves and his islands for whatever the hell they're into.
[00:13:40.046 --> 00:13:41.987]  So, they tried to kill Maxwell too.
[00:13:42.047 --> 00:13:43.528]  Is anybody really surprised by that?
[00:13:44.849 --> 00:13:45.749]  Probably not so much.
[00:13:46.109 --> 00:13:53.573]  And then we have other clips here from some of our corrupt politicians like Gavin Newsom and Joe Biden.
[00:13:54.651 --> 00:13:55.892]  And Kamala Harris.
[00:13:56.292 --> 00:13:57.292]  Oh, oh, guys!
[00:13:58.052 --> 00:13:58.873]  Oh my gosh.
[00:14:00.373 --> 00:14:07.716]  Folks, what they're doing at the Gay Drag Queen for Kids events now is getting so ridiculous.
[00:14:08.697 --> 00:14:18.041]  Where, I mean, we can't even show the videos, technically, because they're just running around naked in front of children now.
[00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:32.301]   And, I mean, I can't put that on TV, but They're dancing around naked for the kids, showing them breasts and genitals, but I can't even show it on TV.
[00:14:33.061 --> 00:14:34.542]  Well, it's the final countdown.
[00:14:34.883 --> 00:14:42.629]  The final countdown for common sense and freedom in America, or the final countdown for global corporate government and world tyranny.
[00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:45.331]  Something has got to give.
[00:14:46.502 --> 00:14:51.724]  And you're tuned in to this transmission because you know it and you want to be on the winning side of history.
[00:14:51.824 --> 00:14:54.045]  Pro-human, pro-freedom, pro-truth.
[00:14:54.846 --> 00:14:55.966]  That's what we represent.
[00:14:57.007 --> 00:15:11.933]  And sadly, we are dealing with globalists and quote-unquote liberals who are really just radical communists and terrorists and degenerates trying to run our country into the ground.
[00:15:12.354 --> 00:15:15.115]  And boy oh boy is Joe Biden doing a fantastic job of it.
[00:15:16.155 --> 00:15:21.697]  Now, Joe Biden is such an embarrassment and such a letdown, even.
[00:15:21.817 --> 00:15:23.417]  I don't know what the Democrats were expecting.
[00:15:24.598 --> 00:15:31.940]  It's odd, though, because when I go back in time, we covered the Democrat debates.
[00:15:33.101 --> 00:15:36.582]  And if you recall at the time, Joe Biden was not winning.
[00:15:37.714 --> 00:15:40.056]  Joe Biden did not win a single debate.
[00:15:40.217 --> 00:15:41.918]  In fact, he was in the bottom.
[00:15:42.819 --> 00:15:48.846]  He was either dead last or in the bottom when they had like the 20-man debate or whatever, that clown show.
[00:15:49.787 --> 00:15:56.173]  Joe Biden was either dead last or at the bottom of the heap in all polls when asked who won the Democrat debates.
[00:15:57.074 --> 00:16:07.566]   And the funny thing is, the people that We're believed to have won the debates are the ones that ended up getting ousted from the debate process and the primaries.
[00:16:08.046 --> 00:16:08.887]  Isn't that something?
[00:16:10.208 --> 00:16:18.535]  Tulsi Gabbard, even Marianne Williamson was a little popular, but they didn't let those two ladies show up to the next debates.
[00:16:18.555 --> 00:16:19.535]  They were a little too popular.
[00:16:20.776 --> 00:16:24.359]  So that's just Democrats rigging their primary process as they always do.
[00:16:24.399 --> 00:16:26.681]  They rigged it for Biden just like they rigged it for Hillary.
[00:16:27.061 --> 00:16:29.023]  Bernie Sanders sits there and takes it like a cuck.
[00:16:30.438 --> 00:16:42.721]  But no, so Biden has been such an embarrassment now, you have, uh, every member, Democrat member of the Senate was asked to endorse Biden for president in 2024.
[00:16:42.861 --> 00:16:44.342]  Only five endorsed him.
[00:16:44.802 --> 00:16:47.523]  What are there, uh, I think 51 Democrat senators?
[00:16:47.683 --> 00:16:48.543]  So five out of 51.
[00:16:48.583 --> 00:16:54.745]  So only 10% of the Senate Democrats would endorse Joe Biden in 2024.
[00:16:57.532 --> 00:17:02.255]  And of course, House Democrats like AOC and others in the squad would not endorse Biden.
[00:17:03.515 --> 00:17:07.938]  And The Atlantic has just published the headline, Biden too old to run in 2024.
[00:17:08.478 --> 00:17:13.841]  Well, yeah, he was, it's not even about age per se, it's about, he's not there, his brain is broke.
[00:17:14.721 --> 00:17:18.624]  He's an old corrupt politician from an era long gone.
[00:17:20.264 --> 00:17:20.985]  He's a racist.
[00:17:24.734 --> 00:17:31.939]  Oh, the Democrats forced him into the presidential race and then stole it from Trump, and now we're dealing with it.
[00:17:31.999 --> 00:17:36.221]  And now even Democrats are saying, this guy's so bad, I'm not going to endorse him in 2024.
[00:17:37.062 --> 00:17:41.004]  And the real question is, why would Biden even come out and say, I'm running in 2024?
[00:17:42.465 --> 00:17:44.807]  And the answer is, to cover his own ass.
[00:17:45.933 --> 00:17:52.438]  Because he's been such an unmitigated disaster, for him to say, I'm not running again, would just add to the proof of that.
[00:17:52.478 --> 00:17:56.381]  So he pretends like he has a success story as a president.
[00:17:56.721 --> 00:17:58.302]  Oh, I gotta run again, absolutely.
[00:17:58.662 --> 00:17:58.843]  No.
[00:18:00.804 --> 00:18:07.909]  Biden stares blankly at reporter asking why he hasn't sanctioned Russian oligarch who wired Hunter Biden millions of dollars.
[00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:10.111]  Yeah, we all know why.
[00:18:10.551 --> 00:18:15.255]  But it's funny, because he had one of those old man moments, if you will.
[00:18:17.056 --> 00:18:21.938]  Where he gets caught off guard by a reporter asking a question and he just loses it.
[00:18:23.298 --> 00:18:25.839]  He just kind of like, he's just gone, like he forgets where he's at.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:32.041]  We had a couple of those moments with Hillary Clinton, where she was like having seizures or something, remember that?
[00:18:32.422 --> 00:18:38.044]  With the media there and then on the DNC platform, and so now Biden is experiencing the same thing.
[00:18:38.904 --> 00:18:49.713]   It's really sad how Democrats can't see How their party is just recycling the biggest criminals in US political history as their leaders, like Clinton and Biden.
[00:18:51.774 --> 00:19:09.187]   But yeah, he gets lost in the press conference, and he just stares blankly at reporters because he forgets where he is, and then the same thing we've seen so many times, his little workers there, those females, That love telling people what to do.
[00:19:09.227 --> 00:19:14.949]  Those Karens, the White House Karens, come in, OK, time to go, time to go, time to leave, time to leave, no more questions, no more questions, gotta go, gotta go, gotta go!
[00:19:15.689 --> 00:19:17.570]  And they shuffle all the reporters out of there.
[00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.050]  Biden doesn't have to answer a single question.
[00:19:20.051 --> 00:19:22.351]  And they just love it, those Karens, the White House Karens.
[00:19:22.371 --> 00:19:23.892]  They just love telling everybody what to do.
[00:19:24.732 --> 00:19:30.934]  But Biden asked about the Russian oligarch that gave his family millions of dollars, and he forgot where he was at, suddenly.
[00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:36.636]  Biden announces sweeping executive order to advance radical LGBTQI+.
[00:19:38.578 --> 00:19:40.739]  He actually called it LGBTQL.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.161]  So he got a little confused.
[00:19:43.201 --> 00:19:44.122]  We all are confused.
[00:19:44.742 --> 00:19:46.443]  But he wants kids to be gay.
[00:19:46.944 --> 00:19:52.307]  He bans conversion therapy, which now includes suggesting that a child should not undergo medical transition.
[00:19:52.567 --> 00:19:57.731]  So basically, if you're a kid, if you have a boy that comes up and is wearing a dress and says, Mommy, I'm a girl now.
[00:19:58.968 --> 00:20:02.149]  I mean, I don't really understand how you even make this an executive order.
[00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:03.669]  I mean, what are you proposing?
[00:20:03.709 --> 00:20:17.333]  So if the parent refuses to let a 7-year-old have gender reassignment surgery, or if a parent refuses to let a 7-year-old have puberty blockers, or if a parent refuses to let their 7-year-old boy be a girl, is that a crime now?
[00:20:17.373 --> 00:20:26.015]  I mean, what is the... It's all just leftist gay activism from the White House in an executive order.
[00:20:26.075 --> 00:20:26.855]  That's all it is.
[00:20:28.157 --> 00:20:44.323]  Aside from the absolute atrocity that it is, how can a president write an executive order saying, parents, you have to teach your kids how to be gay, and if you don't, what?
[00:20:45.724 --> 00:20:46.304]  What, Joe?
[00:20:47.304 --> 00:20:50.345]  What if a parent doesn't want to give their kid puberty blockers?
[00:20:50.806 --> 00:20:53.427]  What if a parent doesn't want to chop their kid's genitals up?
[00:20:54.127 --> 00:20:54.327]  What?
[00:20:55.384 --> 00:20:56.204]  Are you going to arrest them?
[00:20:56.224 --> 00:20:58.306]  Are you going to have the government take the kids from them?
[00:20:58.366 --> 00:20:58.986]  What are you going to do?
[00:21:00.747 --> 00:21:02.828]  Because eventually they're going to have to answer that question.
[00:21:03.168 --> 00:21:14.174]  How do you sign executive orders and have a color of law that's a rainbow flag, color of law, that says, oh, parents that don't want to chop up their kids' genitals are going to be arrested now.
[00:21:15.655 --> 00:21:17.156]  I mean, you know that's where it goes, right?
[00:21:19.057 --> 00:21:20.578]  I don't see where else this thing goes.
[00:21:20.598 --> 00:21:22.379]  It's not like it stops at this executive order.
[00:21:23.759 --> 00:21:24.600]  They're never going to stop.
[00:21:25.916 --> 00:21:28.979]  And by the way, you know, we'll come up and we'll play these videos later.
[00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:36.367]  Folks, they... Drag Queen story time for kids is like child's play compared to what they do now.
[00:21:36.847 --> 00:21:47.678]  I've got videos of drag queens running around with inflatable penises, dildos, that they run up to kids with, with like a two-foot penis inflatable.
[00:21:48.547 --> 00:21:56.312]  They walk around with like these fake double-D breasts that they go literally rub in children's faces.
[00:21:56.892 --> 00:21:58.033]  I have the video of this.
[00:21:59.114 --> 00:22:01.015]  They flash genitals to children.
[00:22:01.155 --> 00:22:04.297]  Men showing children their male members.
[00:22:05.418 --> 00:22:06.018]  But okay.
[00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:10.782]  I guess that's the issue.
[00:22:10.802 --> 00:22:12.403]  I guess that's the big issue for Biden.
[00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:19.653]  I guess that's the big issue for liberals, is making sure that children are exposed to pedophiles and sexual deviants.
[00:22:19.673 --> 00:22:30.422]  I mean, these people should be considered predators and on a watch list, on a neighborhood watch list for what they're doing.
[00:22:31.345 --> 00:22:44.995]  So then I have to debate, okay, I've got videos and pictures of grown men at gay pride parade events for kids, running around with big inflatable penises that they flash and show children.
[00:22:45.596 --> 00:22:49.519]  I've got men dancing with fake breasts that they rub in children's faces.
[00:22:49.899 --> 00:22:53.542]  I've got men dancing for children, showing them their penis and testicles.
[00:22:54.517 --> 00:22:56.259]  But it's gay pride!
[00:22:56.859 --> 00:22:57.540]  It's liberal!
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:02.944]  And Biden signs the executive order saying, if you don't like it, what, Joe?
[00:23:04.285 --> 00:23:11.732]  If you don't show your kids a gay pedophile penis, if you don't show your kids and let them chop up their genitals, what, Joe?
[00:23:11.752 --> 00:23:12.533]  You gonna arrest us?
[00:23:13.073 --> 00:23:18.218]  So while Biden is trying to turn the country into a bunch of homos and pedophiles like he and Barack Obama, I guess, I don't know.
[00:23:18.238 --> 00:23:21.941]  I don't know what's motivating that factor, but seems to be the big push now.
[00:23:23.288 --> 00:23:25.169]  The economy is totally collapsing!
[00:23:25.189 --> 00:23:28.030]  It's not good, folks.
[00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:42.375]  And finally, CEOs and people are actually saying, hey look, you know, you Democrats, you liberals can try to play the blame game here like you've done for years, blaming us, blaming corporate greed, but you know what?
[00:23:42.435 --> 00:23:43.555]  We're not taking it anymore.
[00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:44.715]  It's you.
[00:23:46.436 --> 00:23:52.078]  ExxonMobil fires back at Biden after he accuses oil companies of profiteering in letter.
[00:23:53.527 --> 00:23:58.853]  More oil industry heads blast Joe Biden for threats and blame over energy crisis.
[00:24:00.115 --> 00:24:08.404]  Following on your campaign promise to end fossil fuel, consider just some of the policy and investment signals being sent to the market about our refining industry.
[00:24:08.444 --> 00:24:15.690]   So, again, it's the same issue where Well, liberals are just idiots.
[00:24:15.911 --> 00:24:21.373]  But it's the same issue where Joe Biden campaigns, and he says, we're going to end fossil fuels.
[00:24:21.413 --> 00:24:23.154]  He walks right up to a little girl and grabs her.
[00:24:23.194 --> 00:24:23.794]  You may remember it.
[00:24:23.814 --> 00:24:26.055]  He did that in the campaign about five or six times.
[00:24:26.676 --> 00:24:27.876]  Walks up to little girls and grabs them.
[00:24:28.256 --> 00:24:32.278]  Some of them he invites backstage or them afterwards, like it's a, you know, a groupie at a concert or something.
[00:24:32.298 --> 00:24:33.759]  Little five-year-old girls, little 12-year-old girls.
[00:24:34.499 --> 00:24:35.280]  And that's Joe Biden.
[00:24:35.820 --> 00:24:40.622]  And so he says, we're going to end fossil fuels, and we're going to stop drilling.
[00:24:40.722 --> 00:24:42.043]  And then he does just that.
[00:24:44.474 --> 00:24:52.881]  And then when your gas prices reach record highs, and then when your energy prices skyrocket, he points the finger and blame it everybody else.
[00:24:54.783 --> 00:25:00.047]  Even though that's what he did, that's what he promised he'd do, I mean, and only liberals buy this crap.
[00:25:00.367 --> 00:25:08.394]  That's what's so frustrating, is if we didn't have these brainwashed morons running around believing all this crap, they wouldn't get away with it.
[00:25:08.574 --> 00:25:10.436]  But, I mean, they believe it!
[00:25:11.684 --> 00:25:13.705]  They actually believe what Joe Biden says.
[00:25:16.326 --> 00:25:25.229]  I don't know if there's ever been a bigger case of mass psychosis and mass brainwashing in human history.
[00:25:25.249 --> 00:25:29.910]  I mean, is it going to reach James Jones levels?
[00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:36.393]  I mean, if Joe Biden tells you to drink the Kool-Aid and then, you know, you drink it and you collapse, oh, that's right, the vaccine is killing people.
[00:25:36.553 --> 00:25:37.933]  So I guess they did do that already.
[00:25:39.014 --> 00:25:39.694]  But I digress.
[00:25:41.872 --> 00:25:46.035]  The Democrats run on ending fossil fuels, and they continue to say, we're in a transition!
[00:25:46.295 --> 00:25:47.496]  It's just a transition!
[00:25:49.197 --> 00:25:57.763]  By the way, they don't tell you what the green energies are that they're going to use to replace natural gas or coal, because they don't exist.
[00:25:58.923 --> 00:25:59.604]  We have solar.
[00:26:00.344 --> 00:26:03.967]  We don't really, it's either just not effective, or we don't use it effectively.
[00:26:05.308 --> 00:26:08.230]  I'd be willing to hear either side of that, but it doesn't work.
[00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:10.351]  It's not working for us.
[00:26:10.691 --> 00:26:11.372]  It's not the answer.
[00:26:12.449 --> 00:26:13.229]  We've got windmills.
[00:26:13.329 --> 00:26:14.710]  Those have been a complete disaster.
[00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:17.131]  I think those are probably more harm than good.
[00:26:20.813 --> 00:26:23.514]  So, oh, okay, we're going to shut off oil and we're going to shut off coal.
[00:26:23.534 --> 00:26:24.554]  Oh, what are you going to replace it with?
[00:26:24.954 --> 00:26:26.175]  Eh, we don't know.
[00:26:26.635 --> 00:26:27.316]  It's a transition.
[00:26:29.516 --> 00:26:35.239]  And then they say, but we believe this transition will have good-paying jobs.
[00:26:35.719 --> 00:26:36.359]  What jobs?
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.580]  There are no jobs.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:38.640]  There is no answer.
[00:26:40.302 --> 00:26:41.943]  You're costing people their livelihood.
[00:26:41.963 --> 00:26:43.184]  You're taking away jobs.
[00:26:43.204 --> 00:27:02.156]  I mean, there's a story alone in just people that, from 2016 to 2019, oil companies were hiring people, sometimes at starting wages of $100,000 a year on a salary.
[00:27:02.176 --> 00:27:02.537]  $100,000 a year.
[00:27:05.882 --> 00:27:09.284]  To go work in pipelines and oil fields and all this other stuff.
[00:27:09.824 --> 00:27:11.925]  And it was a huge economic boom.
[00:27:13.306 --> 00:27:15.707]  And that all just got wiped out by Joe Biden.
[00:27:15.747 --> 00:27:18.529]  And he says, I want to give you high-paying jobs.
[00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:20.029]  I want to give you good, high-paying jobs.
[00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:24.872]  As his first day in office, he eliminated about 10,000 good, high-paying jobs.
[00:27:25.592 --> 00:27:27.553]  People making $80,000 a year.
[00:27:29.234 --> 00:27:31.775]  In the energy sector that he shut down.
[00:27:32.056 --> 00:27:32.436]  So, yeah.
[00:27:33.956 --> 00:27:38.916]   You can say Gas company CEOs or whatever have corporate greed.
[00:27:38.976 --> 00:27:39.416]  Okay, fine.
[00:27:39.436 --> 00:27:39.716]  Whatever.
[00:27:40.396 --> 00:27:41.916]  They're not the ones doing this.
[00:27:42.276 --> 00:27:43.077]  Biden is.
[00:27:43.797 --> 00:27:44.757]  Democrats are.
[00:27:46.638 --> 00:27:48.498]  And to deny that is just to deny reality.
[00:27:50.718 --> 00:27:51.519]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:27:51.959 --> 00:27:54.819]  Recession fears surge among CEOs.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:05.002]  We need to prepare for tough times ahead, said the CEO of Solvay, Ilham Qadri.
[00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:07.632]  Brussels-based chemical maker.
[00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:10.455]  And it's just got all these different CEOs in there.
[00:28:10.515 --> 00:28:18.981]  And yeah, I mean, so it's like, the economy is collapsing, Biden is blaming these CEOs, and they're saying, it's not us!
[00:28:19.542 --> 00:28:21.223]  Why would we want the economy to collapse?
[00:28:22.264 --> 00:28:24.406]  If we have corporate greed, we want to make more money!
[00:28:24.966 --> 00:28:28.469]  Why would us making less money be something we want if we're greedy?
[00:28:31.138 --> 00:28:34.021]  Well, what is Biden up to as he tanks the economy anyway?
[00:28:34.741 --> 00:28:35.742]  Biden administration?
[00:28:35.822 --> 00:28:38.144]  Oh, well, he's making the kids gay, but let's not forget about this one.
[00:28:39.145 --> 00:28:45.751]  Biden administration to spend $14 million a year rebuilding Mozambique province.
[00:28:47.193 --> 00:28:51.196]  Yes, you guys planning on... Anybody taking a trip to Mozambique?
[00:28:52.057 --> 00:28:53.018]  Mozambique trip, anybody?
[00:28:53.458 --> 00:28:55.540]  Anybody want to hop on a plane, head on over to Mozambique?
[00:28:56.181 --> 00:28:57.402]  You might be able to find some clean water.
[00:28:59.299 --> 00:29:01.921]  14 million a year rebuilding Mozambique province.
[00:29:02.221 --> 00:29:08.325]  You know, that'd be nice if we were doing really, really well here and we could afford maybe something like that, but we can't.
[00:29:10.847 --> 00:29:12.668]  You think any of this money is going to get stolen, by the way?
[00:29:13.129 --> 00:29:14.230]  The administration of the U.S.
[00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:20.334]  President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday plans to provide $14 million annually over the next decade.
[00:29:21.084 --> 00:29:29.926]  To the Mozambique province of Cabo Delgado in an effort to rebuild the region after it was overrun by, uh-oh, Islamic terrorists in recent months?
[00:29:30.346 --> 00:29:30.846]  Oh boy.
[00:29:31.647 --> 00:29:36.428]  The state-run Mozambique news agency reported, how much of that money is going to get stolen?
[00:29:37.408 --> 00:29:39.489]  What percentage of that cut is for the big guy?
[00:29:39.509 --> 00:29:44.330]  14 mil to Mozambique a year for the next 10 years.
[00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.630]  That's 140 mil for Mozambique.
[00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:47.591]  Have you been to New York City lately?
[00:29:47.691 --> 00:29:48.271]  It's a shithole.
[00:29:49.028 --> 00:29:51.749]  But hey, let's build Mozambique!
[00:29:53.349 --> 00:29:55.950]  You gonna be going to Mozambique anytime soon?
[00:29:55.970 --> 00:30:01.631]  Wanna go play radical jihad in Mozambique?
[00:30:01.911 --> 00:30:04.171]  140 mil promised by the Biden administration to Mozambique.
[00:30:04.251 --> 00:30:05.812]  Hey, that's great, more humanitarian aid.
[00:30:06.572 --> 00:30:11.153]  The US giving all of its money away to foreign countries.
[00:30:12.935 --> 00:30:14.756]  Most of that's probably just going to get stolen.
[00:30:15.256 --> 00:30:19.279]  Because all the countries we give foreign aid to never seem to get better.
[00:30:19.759 --> 00:30:20.899]  They actually get worse.
[00:30:20.919 --> 00:30:21.600]  Have you noticed that?
[00:30:23.641 --> 00:30:28.724]  The countries where we send foreign aid actually get worse after we send them the aid.
[00:30:28.964 --> 00:30:30.124]  Just look at Central America.
[00:30:30.185 --> 00:30:31.225]  Look at Haiti.
[00:30:32.306 --> 00:30:33.967]  And now, probably, Mozambique.
[00:30:34.967 --> 00:30:45.387]   If it's really overrun by radical Islamic terrorists, or maybe it's a CIA front group, Where do you think that money is going to go, folks?
[00:30:46.468 --> 00:30:48.890]  What do you think is going to happen in Mozambique with that money?
[00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:51.832]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:30:54.293 --> 00:30:56.995]  Ah, another hundred billion for Ukraine, too, you know.
[00:30:58.496 --> 00:30:58.977]  You know.
[00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:07.062]  You're working five jobs to keep a roof over your head and gas in your car and food on the table.
[00:31:08.363 --> 00:31:10.725]  Biden can sign checks to foreign countries at will.
[00:31:11.866 --> 00:31:16.109]  Stock market fall has wiped out $3 trillion in retirement savings this year.
[00:31:16.169 --> 00:31:16.790]  Thanks, Biden.
[00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:18.771]  How's your 401k doing, guys?
[00:31:19.632 --> 00:31:19.912]  Yeah.
[00:31:21.033 --> 00:31:31.280]  Now, a lot of this is kind of like, it was so good under Trump, that's almost... So really, the reason it's so bad is because it was so good under Trump.
[00:31:31.681 --> 00:31:36.544]  With retirement, savings, 401ks, stocks, everybody was going gangbusters under Trump.
[00:31:36.604 --> 00:31:40.027]  So now that it's so bad, it looks even worse because it was so good before.
[00:31:41.513 --> 00:31:44.235]  The juxtaposition there is pretty incredible.
[00:31:44.815 --> 00:31:53.640]  Cost to finance a new car hits a record $656 per month, and auto shoppers could pay even more with latest FedRate hike.
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:55.981]  How are you guys liking Democrats in power?
[00:31:56.001 --> 00:31:57.082]  How are you guys enjoying that?
[00:31:57.762 --> 00:32:02.687]  Fed promises unconditional approach to taking down inflation in report to Congress.
[00:32:03.188 --> 00:32:04.610]  Oh, unconditional approach.
[00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.952]  So how long do you think they would need here, guys?
[00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:12.898]  They're promising a full-fledged effort to end inflation, which first they said doesn't exist, doesn't exist.
[00:32:13.359 --> 00:32:15.161]  Oh, okay, now they're going to have a full-fledged effort.
[00:32:15.381 --> 00:32:16.362]  How long do you think they need?
[00:32:16.382 --> 00:32:16.823]  Three months?
[00:32:16.903 --> 00:32:17.423]  Six months?
[00:32:17.463 --> 00:32:17.764]  A year?
[00:32:17.784 --> 00:32:26.170]   Because I bet you In three months, or in six months, or in a year, inflation ain't going down, folks.
[00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:28.251]  It's only going up.
[00:32:28.791 --> 00:32:32.854]  And then Biden says to the press, he says, no, we're not in a recession.
[00:32:32.894 --> 00:32:34.055]  A recession is not inevitable.
[00:32:34.615 --> 00:32:34.855]  What?
[00:32:35.496 --> 00:32:36.396]  We're in it right now!
[00:32:36.776 --> 00:32:41.940]  So while Biden is trying to turn the country into a bunch of homos and pedophiles like he and Barack Obama, I guess, I don't know.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.702]  I don't know what's motivating that factor, but seems to be the big push now.
[00:32:47.023 --> 00:32:48.844]  The economy is totally collapsing.
[00:32:50.885 --> 00:32:51.725]  Not good, folks.
[00:32:52.546 --> 00:33:06.093]  And finally, CEOs and people are actually saying, hey look, you know, you Democrats, you liberals can try to play the blame game here like you've done for years, blaming us, blaming corporate greed, but you know what?
[00:33:06.133 --> 00:33:07.273]  We're not taking it anymore.
[00:33:07.674 --> 00:33:08.434]  It's you.
[00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:15.798]  ExxonMobil fires back at Biden after he accuses oil companies of profiteering in letter.
[00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:22.555]  More oil industry heads blast Joe Biden for threats and blame over energy crisis.
[00:33:23.817 --> 00:33:32.105]  Following on your campaign promise to end fossil fuel, consider just some of the policy and investment signals being sent to the market about our refining industry.
[00:33:32.165 --> 00:33:39.411]   So, again, it's the same issue where Well, liberals are just idiots.
[00:33:39.611 --> 00:33:45.094]  But it's the same issue where Joe Biden campaigns, and he says, we're going to end fossil fuels.
[00:33:45.114 --> 00:33:46.875]  He walks right up to a little girl and grabs her.
[00:33:46.915 --> 00:33:47.496]  You may remember it.
[00:33:47.536 --> 00:33:49.777]  He did that in the campaign about five or six times.
[00:33:50.397 --> 00:33:51.598]  Walks up to little girls and grabs them.
[00:33:51.978 --> 00:33:56.001]  Some of them he invites backstage with them afterwards, like it's a, you know, a groupie at a concert or something.
[00:33:56.021 --> 00:33:57.482]  Little five-year-old girls, little 12-year-old girls.
[00:33:58.202 --> 00:33:59.003]  And that's Joe Biden.
[00:33:59.523 --> 00:34:04.346]  And so he says, we're going to end fossil fuels, and we're going to stop drilling.
[00:34:04.446 --> 00:34:05.747]  And then he does just that.
[00:34:08.197 --> 00:34:16.603]  And then when your gas prices reach record highs, and then when your energy prices skyrocket, he points the finger and blame it everybody else.
[00:34:18.485 --> 00:34:23.769]  Even though that's what he did, that's what he promised he'd do, I mean, and only liberals buy this crap.
[00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:32.095]  That's what's so frustrating, is if we didn't have these brainwashed morons running around believing all this crap, they wouldn't get away with it.
[00:34:32.295 --> 00:34:34.157]  But, I mean, they believe it!
[00:34:35.387 --> 00:34:37.408]  They actually believe what Joe Biden says.
[00:34:40.029 --> 00:34:48.972]  I don't know if there's ever been a bigger case of mass psychosis and mass brainwashing in human history.
[00:34:51.193 --> 00:34:53.613]  I mean, is it going to reach James Jones levels?
[00:34:53.653 --> 00:35:00.116]  I mean, if Joe Biden tells you to drink the Kool-Aid and then, you know, you drink it and you collapse, oh, that's right, the vaccine is killing people.
[00:35:00.256 --> 00:35:01.656]  So I guess they did do that already.
[00:35:02.717 --> 00:35:03.477]  But I digress.
[00:35:05.592 --> 00:35:09.695]  The Democrats run on ending fossil fuels, and they continue to say, we're in a transition!
[00:35:09.715 --> 00:35:11.196]  It's just a transition!
[00:35:12.917 --> 00:35:21.483]  By the way, they don't tell you what the green energies are that they're going to use to replace natural gas or coal, because they don't exist.
[00:35:22.623 --> 00:35:23.324]  We have solar.
[00:35:24.064 --> 00:35:27.687]  We don't really, it's either just not effective, or we don't use it effectively.
[00:35:29.028 --> 00:35:31.950]  I'd be willing to hear either side of that, but it doesn't work.
[00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:34.071]  It's not working for us.
[00:35:34.411 --> 00:35:35.072]  It's not the answer.
[00:35:36.172 --> 00:35:36.952]  We've got windmills.
[00:35:37.032 --> 00:35:38.433]  Those have been a complete disaster.
[00:35:39.213 --> 00:35:40.834]  I think those are probably more harm than good.
[00:35:44.535 --> 00:35:47.216]  So, oh, okay, we're going to shut off oil and we're going to shut off coal.
[00:35:47.236 --> 00:35:48.276]  Oh, what are you going to replace it with?
[00:35:48.676 --> 00:35:49.897]  Eh, we don't know.
[00:35:50.357 --> 00:35:51.017]  It's a transition.
[00:35:53.218 --> 00:35:58.939]  And then they say, but we believe this transition will have good-paying jobs.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.080]  What jobs?
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:01.280]  There are no jobs.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.361]  There is no answer.
[00:36:04.005 --> 00:36:05.646]  You're costing people their livelihood.
[00:36:05.666 --> 00:36:06.907]  You're taking away jobs.
[00:36:06.927 --> 00:36:25.039]  I mean, there's a story alone in just people that, from 2016 to 2019, oil companies were hiring people, sometimes at starting wages of $100,000 a year on a salary.
[00:36:25.059 --> 00:36:25.259]  $100,000 a year.
[00:36:29.588 --> 00:36:32.990]  To go work in pipelines and oil fields and all this other stuff.
[00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.651]  And it was a huge economic boom.
[00:36:37.012 --> 00:36:39.413]  And that all just got wiped out by Joe Biden.
[00:36:39.453 --> 00:36:42.235]  And he says, I want to give you high-paying jobs.
[00:36:42.375 --> 00:36:43.755]  I want to give you good, high-paying jobs.
[00:36:44.216 --> 00:36:48.578]  As his first day in office, he eliminated about 10,000 good, high-paying jobs.
[00:36:49.298 --> 00:36:51.279]  People making $80,000 up a year.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.481]  In the energy sector that he shut down.
[00:36:55.762 --> 00:36:56.142]  So yeah.
[00:36:57.662 --> 00:37:03.417]   You can say Gas company CEOs or whatever, or have corporate greed, okay fine, whatever.
[00:37:04.117 --> 00:37:06.779]  They're not the ones doing this, Biden is.
[00:37:07.519 --> 00:37:08.480]  Democrats are.
[00:37:10.361 --> 00:37:12.222]  And to deny that is just to deny reality.
[00:37:14.443 --> 00:37:18.526]  Wall Street Journal, recession fears surge among CEOs.
[00:37:20.427 --> 00:37:26.290]  We need to prepare for tough times ahead, said the CEO of Solvay.
[00:37:27.836 --> 00:37:31.337]  Ilham Qadri, Brussels-based chemical maker.
[00:37:32.278 --> 00:37:34.159]  And it's just got all these different CEOs in there.
[00:37:34.219 --> 00:37:42.682]  And yeah, I mean, so it's like, the economy is collapsing, Biden is blaming these CEOs, and they're saying, it's not us!
[00:37:43.242 --> 00:37:44.943]  Why would we want the economy to collapse?
[00:37:45.983 --> 00:37:48.124]  If we have corporate greed, we want to make more money!
[00:37:48.684 --> 00:37:52.166]  Why would us making less money be something we want if we're greedy?
[00:37:54.858 --> 00:37:57.719]  Well, what is Biden up to as he tanks the economy anyway?
[00:37:58.459 --> 00:38:01.859]  Biden administration, oh well, he's making the kids gay, but let's not forget about this one.
[00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:09.461]  Biden administration to spend $14 million a year rebuilding Mozambique province.
[00:38:10.881 --> 00:38:14.902]  Yes, you guys planning on, anybody taking a trip to Mozambique?
[00:38:15.742 --> 00:38:16.722]  Mozambique trip, anybody?
[00:38:17.162 --> 00:38:19.223]  Anybody want to hop on a plane, head on over to Mozambique?
[00:38:19.883 --> 00:38:21.103]  You might be able to find some clean water.
[00:38:23.019 --> 00:38:25.621]  14 million a year rebuilding Mozambique province.
[00:38:25.941 --> 00:38:32.025]  You know, that'd be nice if we were doing really, really well here and we could afford maybe something like that, but we can't.
[00:38:34.567 --> 00:38:36.388]  You think any of this money is going to get stolen, by the way?
[00:38:36.829 --> 00:38:37.950]  The administration of the U.S.
[00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:44.034]  President Joe Biden announced on Tuesday plans to provide $14 million annually over the next decade.
[00:38:44.787 --> 00:38:53.633]  To the Mozambique province of Cabo Delgado in an effort to rebuild the region after it was overrun by, uh-oh, Islamic terrorists in recent months?
[00:38:54.053 --> 00:38:54.573]  Oh boy.
[00:38:55.374 --> 00:39:00.137]  The state-run Mozambique news agency reported... How much of that money is going to get stolen?
[00:39:01.118 --> 00:39:03.219]  What percentage of that cut is for the big guy?
[00:39:03.239 --> 00:39:08.062]  14 mil to Mozambique a year for the next 10 years.
[00:39:08.082 --> 00:39:09.363]  That's 140 mil for Mozambique.
[00:39:09.923 --> 00:39:11.324]  Have you been to New York City lately?
[00:39:11.424 --> 00:39:12.005]  It's a shithole.
[00:39:12.728 --> 00:39:17.112]  But hey, let's build Mozambique!
[00:39:17.132 --> 00:39:19.655]  Gonna be going to Mozambique anytime soon?
[00:39:19.675 --> 00:39:25.360]  Wanna go play radical jihad in Mozambique?
[00:39:25.641 --> 00:39:27.883]  140 mil promised by the Biden administration to Mozambique.
[00:39:27.983 --> 00:39:29.524]  Hey, that's great, more humanitarian aid.
[00:39:30.305 --> 00:39:34.890]  The US giving all of its money away to foreign countries.
[00:39:36.656 --> 00:39:42.999]  Most of that's probably just going to get stolen, because all the countries we give foreign aid to never seem to get better.
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:44.620]  They actually get worse.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.300]  Have you noticed that?
[00:39:47.342 --> 00:39:52.444]  The countries where we send foreign aid actually get worse after we send them the aid.
[00:39:52.684 --> 00:39:57.687]  Just look at Central America, look at Haiti, and now probably Mozambique.
[00:39:58.687 --> 00:40:09.107]   If it's really overrun by radical Islamic terrorists, or maybe it's a CIA front group, Where do you think that money's gonna go, folks?
[00:40:10.168 --> 00:40:12.609]  What do you think is gonna happen in Mozambique with that money?
[00:40:12.889 --> 00:40:15.551]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:40:18.012 --> 00:40:20.714]  Ah, another hundred billion for Ukraine, too, you know.
[00:40:22.195 --> 00:40:22.695]  You know.
[00:40:25.556 --> 00:40:30.779]  You're working five jobs to keep a roof over your head and gas in your car and food on the table.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.502]  Biden can sign checks to foreign countries at will.
[00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:39.832]  Stock market fall has wiped out $3 trillion in retirement savings this year.
[00:40:39.872 --> 00:40:40.512]  Thanks, Biden.
[00:40:40.992 --> 00:40:42.473]  How's your 401K doing, guys?
[00:40:43.354 --> 00:40:43.614]  Yeah.
[00:40:44.755 --> 00:40:54.981]  Now, a lot of this is kind of like, it was so good under Trump, that's almost... So really, the reason it's so bad is because it was so good under Trump.
[00:40:55.402 --> 00:41:00.525]  With retirement, savings, 401Ks, stocks, everybody was going gangbusters under Trump.
[00:41:00.565 --> 00:41:03.727]  So now that it's so bad, it looks even worse because it was so good before.
[00:41:05.233 --> 00:41:07.935]  The juxtaposition there is pretty incredible.
[00:41:08.535 --> 00:41:17.361]  Cost to finance a new car hits a record $656 per month, and auto shoppers could pay even more with latest FedRate hike.
[00:41:17.821 --> 00:41:19.702]  How are you guys liking Democrats in power?
[00:41:19.722 --> 00:41:20.803]  How are you guys enjoying that?
[00:41:21.463 --> 00:41:26.404]  Fed promises unconditional approach to taking down inflation in report to Congress.
[00:41:27.045 --> 00:41:27.085]  Oh!
[00:41:27.345 --> 00:41:28.325]  Unconditional approach.
[00:41:28.665 --> 00:41:30.666]  So how long do you think they would need here, guys?
[00:41:30.786 --> 00:41:36.127]  They're promising a full-fledged effort to end inflation, which first they said doesn't exist.
[00:41:36.167 --> 00:41:36.587]  Doesn't exist.
[00:41:36.607 --> 00:41:37.187]  Oh, okay.
[00:41:37.207 --> 00:41:38.848]  Now they're going to have a full-fledged effort.
[00:41:39.088 --> 00:41:40.048]  How long do you think they need?
[00:41:40.088 --> 00:41:40.528]  Three months?
[00:41:40.608 --> 00:41:41.128]  Six months?
[00:41:41.168 --> 00:41:41.448]  A year?
[00:41:41.468 --> 00:41:49.870]   Because I bet you In three months or in six months or in a year, inflation ain't going down, folks.
[00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:51.971]  It's only going up.
[00:41:52.511 --> 00:41:56.552]  And then Biden says to the press, he says, no, we're not in a recession.
[00:41:56.612 --> 00:41:57.772]  A recession is not inevitable.
[00:41:58.312 --> 00:41:58.552]  What?
[00:41:59.192 --> 00:42:00.112]  We're in it right now.
[00:42:01.433 --> 00:42:18.855]   Boy, don't you wish you could just go out into the woods or to a lake somewhere, a mountain, just Sit down, turn on some country music and just enjoy the beautiful splendor of God's creation without having to deal with these damn demons trying to ruin it.
[00:42:20.616 --> 00:42:21.257]  That'd be nice.
[00:42:22.398 --> 00:42:30.343]  We can hope, we can dream, and we can try to build that future that we all want to see.
[00:42:31.564 --> 00:42:35.767]  But we've got some things in our way, if you know what I mean.
[00:42:35.947 --> 00:42:37.489]  We've got some things in our way.
[00:42:38.516 --> 00:42:42.678]  All right, let's take a look here at some of the latest developments on the January 6th front.
[00:42:44.279 --> 00:42:51.622]  Now this was big news breaking yesterday with Alex Jones and Pete Santilli, and I had some other people reach out and discuss this as well.
[00:42:52.843 --> 00:42:57.285]  January 6th committee commits illegal acts that could end the entire persecution.
[00:42:57.465 --> 00:43:09.808]   Now, let me kind of just give you the backdrop here that, aside from The details, what needs to be understood.
[00:43:12.169 --> 00:43:25.756]  What the Democrats are doing with this January 6th committee and hearing, and even in a lot of these cases, has never been seen or done before in American legal or justice history.
[00:43:26.076 --> 00:43:26.937]  Never been done before.
[00:43:27.837 --> 00:43:36.241]  Holding people for non-violent crimes and holding political prisoners pretrial as long as they've done, never done before.
[00:43:36.581 --> 00:43:37.302]  Never been done before.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:50.816]  And I mean, it's straight up political prisoners, but, okay, aside from saying, hey, they're political prisoners, which is true, just the mere fact that they're holding these people pretrial, a lot of them just for misdemeanors.
[00:43:52.466 --> 00:43:53.908]  Is already unprecedented.
[00:43:54.228 --> 00:44:01.996]  And so what they're doing now, because they realize, you know, judges and lawyers are starting to look at this and realize what it really is.
[00:44:02.136 --> 00:44:06.100]  It's Democrat Party political prisoners and persecution.
[00:44:06.901 --> 00:44:14.228]  And they're kind of starting to tilt their head a little bit, saying, yeah, this is really not good and extremely dangerous.
[00:44:15.325 --> 00:44:16.225]  Still going on.
[00:44:16.806 --> 00:44:22.107]  So what the Democrats are doing now is they're trying to ramp up the charges, and they're just inventing new charges.
[00:44:23.608 --> 00:44:30.930]  It's like, you already have a case, you've already been indicted, and then the Democrats, they just give you a new charge, just out of the blue.
[00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:32.990]  That's never been done before.
[00:44:33.631 --> 00:44:34.791]  But that's not even the big one.
[00:44:37.012 --> 00:44:41.407]   For them, There's a lot of censorship going on here.
[00:44:41.447 --> 00:45:00.295]  For example, they won't release all of the January 6th footage that they have, because it'll show Antifa going in first, and it'll show how, aside from a couple dust-ups with cops that got bad, and a couple people breaking windows or stealing property from inside, 99% of the activity that day was innocent.
[00:45:01.195 --> 00:45:04.156]  And they don't want you to see that, because they've been lying about it from the beginning.
[00:45:04.457 --> 00:45:07.638]  They don't want you to see the cops lobbing grenades into the crowds.
[00:45:10.589 --> 00:45:13.611]  They don't want you to see the cops waving people into the building.
[00:45:13.791 --> 00:45:16.373]  They don't want you to see the cops removing the barricades.
[00:45:16.553 --> 00:45:19.675]  They don't want you to see the cops opening the magnetic lock doors.
[00:45:20.896 --> 00:45:24.659]  They don't want you to see the cops actually having conversations with some of the people out there.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.061]  Saying, alright, how can we do this?
[00:45:27.101 --> 00:45:28.141]  How can we maintain the peace?
[00:45:28.201 --> 00:45:29.222]  How can we do this the right way?
[00:45:31.984 --> 00:45:33.245]  So that's all unprecedented.
[00:45:34.085 --> 00:45:48.621]   And by the way, what's not unprecedented but what's going on behind the scenes I mean, there's only so much I want to say here, because obviously I've got my own legal case, but basically, folks, they... I mean, discovery goes both ways.
[00:45:48.901 --> 00:45:49.822]  I'll just put it that way.
[00:45:50.742 --> 00:45:57.786]  But anything a January 6th defendant gets in discovery is not allowed to be shown to the public.
[00:45:59.367 --> 00:46:00.248]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:46:00.988 --> 00:46:10.248]   So... Then they have these depositions That are totally illegitimate.
[00:46:11.449 --> 00:46:13.589]  And these witness testimonies that are totally illegitimate.
[00:46:13.969 --> 00:46:15.010]  It's a kangaroo court.
[00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.850]  It's not even a real hearing.
[00:46:18.511 --> 00:46:24.492]  Because you don't have any defense or two sides presenting evidence or points.
[00:46:24.852 --> 00:46:26.113]  It's just one side.
[00:46:26.373 --> 00:46:28.033]  And it's just a made-for-TV event.
[00:46:29.173 --> 00:46:30.534]  That they're pretending is a real hearing.
[00:46:30.954 --> 00:46:33.114]  And so then you take deposition.
[00:46:33.154 --> 00:46:35.635]  You take witness deposition for eight hours.
[00:46:35.815 --> 00:46:37.116]  Ten hours in some cases.
[00:46:37.856 --> 00:46:38.616]  Of these individuals.
[00:46:39.741 --> 00:46:45.684]  And then you only make 30 seconds of it or a minute or two minutes of it available to the public?
[00:46:47.185 --> 00:46:49.306]  Available to lawyers in the defense?
[00:46:50.466 --> 00:46:53.208]  Again, totally unprecedented, all illegal.
[00:46:53.688 --> 00:47:08.637]   So, I think the judges that have been looking at this have just been kind of Going along, nobody wanted to be the judge to stick the neck out there and disrupt the Democrat Party agenda, because they know what happens when you do it.
[00:47:08.717 --> 00:47:10.478]  They send terrorists to your house to kill you.
[00:47:11.139 --> 00:47:16.845]  So nobody wanted to disrupt the Democrat Party agenda at the risk of the Democrats sending a terrorist to your house to assassinate you.
[00:47:17.686 --> 00:47:22.891]  Just ask Steve Scalise about that, or Rand Paul, or Justice Kavanaugh.
[00:47:24.073 --> 00:47:25.874]  And so nobody wanted to be that judge.
[00:47:25.955 --> 00:47:26.935]  Nobody wanted to do that.
[00:47:27.456 --> 00:47:30.318]  So these things just went on and just got worse and it got worse and it got worse.
[00:47:30.718 --> 00:47:32.600]  And now though, it's so bad.
[00:47:34.261 --> 00:47:46.211]  I think it's so bad now that judges and lawyers are sitting here saying, okay, this is, maybe we were in it to protect ourselves, not wanting the Democrat terrorists to kill us.
[00:47:47.192 --> 00:47:54.887]   And maybe we were just kind of going along saying, you know, in the belief that This is fair game that we're playing here?
[00:47:55.407 --> 00:47:56.708]  And the Democrats are playing fairly?
[00:47:56.929 --> 00:47:58.210]  Well that's all out the window now.
[00:47:59.611 --> 00:48:01.573]  Everyone knows the Democrats aren't playing fairly.
[00:48:02.054 --> 00:48:04.336]  Everyone knows this whole thing is a sham and a charade.
[00:48:05.397 --> 00:48:09.601]  But the Democrats still have their terrorists that they send to judges' houses to kill them.
[00:48:11.063 --> 00:48:12.024]  So there's a crutch there.
[00:48:14.005 --> 00:48:19.207]  But that was all broken down on the Alex Jones Show with Pete Santilli yesterday and I think there's gonna be a lot more coming out.
[00:48:19.667 --> 00:48:21.288]  Louie Gohmert put this out today.
[00:48:21.768 --> 00:48:23.089]  It's a sad time for America.
[00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:24.569]  One thing is very clear.
[00:48:24.869 --> 00:48:29.311]  Pre-trial confinement is never ever to be used for punishment and that's exactly what has happened.
[00:48:29.892 --> 00:48:37.635]  It's been used for intimidation, punishment, and vengefulness from a DC jail that has enjoyed screwing over the J6 defendants.
[00:48:37.835 --> 00:48:45.020]   Louie Gohmert, one of the few speaking out against the political imprisonment Of their opposition by the Democrats.
[00:48:45.861 --> 00:48:47.902]  And they just arrested Dr. Simone Gold.
[00:48:49.503 --> 00:48:50.604]  And here's the CNN headline.
[00:48:50.644 --> 00:48:53.346]  Doctor known for spreading COVID misinformation.
[00:48:53.606 --> 00:48:56.368]  Well, first of all, what does that have anything to do with this arrest?
[00:48:56.388 --> 00:48:58.489]  They just had to, they just had to take a dig at her.
[00:48:59.430 --> 00:48:59.670]  You know?
[00:49:00.751 --> 00:49:02.432]  They just had to take a dig at her.
[00:49:02.712 --> 00:49:03.853]  Oh, COVID misinformation.
[00:49:04.093 --> 00:49:08.456]  They don't tell you any of the COVID misinformation, by the way, because everything she's reported on COVID has actually come true.
[00:49:08.516 --> 00:49:09.937]  All the misinformation was from Fauci.
[00:49:10.057 --> 00:49:12.219]  But, okay, that's not the story.
[00:49:13.373 --> 00:49:20.081]  They've sentenced her to 60 days in jail, and they've given her a $10,000 fine.
[00:49:23.604 --> 00:49:24.846]  And what did she do?
[00:49:24.966 --> 00:49:29.091]  She did go into the Capitol that day, and at one point she was on a bullhorn.
[00:49:30.222 --> 00:49:43.529]  Now if you had equal and fair punishment, Dr. Simone Gold would spend a day in jail, maybe a night, maybe a couple hours at max, and she'd get some community service and maybe some probation.
[00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:53.135]  And that's what should apply to whoever does political demonstrations in D.C.
[00:49:55.097 --> 00:50:00.100]  But no, what happens is if you're a liberal or a Democrat that does a political demonstration in D.C.
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:03.762]  or the Capitol or one of these congressional buildings, you get no punishment.
[00:50:04.242 --> 00:50:11.446]  You might get arrested and booked, but they'll release you, they'll drop the charges, it's what happens 90% of the time with the Democrat liberal activists.
[00:50:11.526 --> 00:50:15.008]  But if you're a conservative activist, they throw the book at you.
[00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:22.752]  You know that they wanted me, this case is still ongoing, they wanted to put me in jail for 90 days.
[00:50:24.835 --> 00:50:27.356]  And ban me from Washington, D.C.
[00:50:27.836 --> 00:50:30.897]  for my 30-second interruption of Nadler's fake impeachment hearing?
[00:50:33.477 --> 00:50:40.479]  And the punishment was so aggressive that they were trying to get from me, they had to go through three different judges.
[00:50:40.539 --> 00:50:41.680]  It happened so long ago now, I can't remember.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.160]  Three different judges.
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:49.422]  They kept having to switch judges because no judge was going to give a man 90 days in jail and ban him from D.C.
[00:50:49.742 --> 00:50:53.003]  for 30 seconds interruption of Jerry Nadler's fake impeachment hearing.
[00:50:55.086 --> 00:50:57.027]  And now they're ramping that back up against me.
[00:50:57.067 --> 00:51:03.832]  I'm not gonna make the show against me, but let's just say, yeah, the Simone Gold treatment, they'd love something like that for me.
[00:51:05.233 --> 00:51:07.014]  So, oh, they just round up Simone Gold.
[00:51:07.134 --> 00:51:10.637]  Oh, they just round up this GOP candidate for governor of Michigan.
[00:51:11.277 --> 00:51:12.338]  Oh, they're just throwing him in jail.
[00:51:12.378 --> 00:51:23.986]  I'm telling you, folks, I am telling you right now, the Democrats, if they still exist in 2050, they will be, Democrats will be arresting people for January 6th forever.
[00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.710]  Forever.
[00:51:27.332 --> 00:51:29.653]  And it'll get to a point where it doesn't even matter if you were in D.C.
[00:51:29.673 --> 00:51:29.933]  or not.
[00:51:30.194 --> 00:51:39.460]  If you said anything about Trump winning the 2020 election, if you said anything about January 6th not being a riot, they will come for you and arrest you as soon as they find you on the map.
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:41.081]  Oh, you're running for local city council?
[00:51:41.422 --> 00:51:43.343]  Oh, he said Trump won in the year 2022, it's now the year 2040, they arrest you.
[00:51:46.308 --> 00:51:47.308]  That's where this is going.
[00:51:48.288 --> 00:51:51.429]  And now they're going after Clarence Thomas' wife.
[00:51:52.189 --> 00:51:59.851]  These sickos, these freaks in the Democrat Party are now targeting Clarence Thomas' wife.
[00:52:00.171 --> 00:52:06.653]  How long is it going to be before the Democrats send an assassin to Clarence Thomas' house to kill him like they did Kavanaugh?
[00:52:06.673 --> 00:52:08.433]  Still nothing from the FBI on that though.
[00:52:08.573 --> 00:52:11.054]  They're not going to punish Democrat terrorists.
[00:52:12.134 --> 00:52:19.510]   So now the Domestic Terror Group Democrat Party is targeting Clarence Thomas' wife, these sick freaks.
[00:52:22.273 --> 00:52:25.737]  They have published this letter at the Gateway Pundit.
[00:52:25.797 --> 00:52:26.597]  Read the letter.
[00:52:27.478 --> 00:52:31.983]  The sham January 6th committee sent Ginny Thomas requesting her appearance.
[00:52:33.527 --> 00:52:34.827]  Yes, they want to question her.
[00:52:35.548 --> 00:52:45.651]  They want a 10-hour deposition from her so they can pull 30 seconds of clips to put up in another sham made-for-TV event to make her look bad.
[00:52:46.071 --> 00:52:48.472]  Haven't you Democrats done enough to that family?
[00:52:48.632 --> 00:52:52.633]  Haven't you Democrats tormented the Thomas family enough?
[00:52:52.733 --> 00:52:54.854]  Hasn't Biden done enough to that man?
[00:52:56.315 --> 00:52:59.516]  Why do Democrats hate Clarence Thomas so much?
[00:52:59.956 --> 00:53:00.616]  Oh, I know why.
[00:53:00.736 --> 00:53:01.676]  Because he's black.
[00:53:02.197 --> 00:53:02.977]  That's why they hate him.
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:05.761]  And he's not a Democrat.
[00:53:07.503 --> 00:53:07.723]  Yes.
[00:53:08.384 --> 00:53:09.125]  That's exactly it.
[00:53:10.586 --> 00:53:11.567]  Yeah, who are the real bigots?
[00:53:11.588 --> 00:53:12.448]  Who are the real racists?
[00:53:13.269 --> 00:53:14.130]  Uh, liberals.
[00:53:15.532 --> 00:53:18.615]  January 6th committee leaks more Jenny Thomas emails to Washington Post.
[00:53:19.055 --> 00:53:21.378]  Oh, now because they do Discovery.
[00:53:24.867 --> 00:53:33.714]  And I guess the Washington Post and others are in direct communication with the FBI and with the Washington Post, and they just decide, yeah, you know what, we'll give you some of these emails.
[00:53:33.834 --> 00:53:34.315]  I mean, who knows?
[00:53:34.335 --> 00:53:35.396]  They can release my emails.
[00:53:35.716 --> 00:53:37.017]  They can release my emails any day.
[00:53:37.037 --> 00:53:38.939]  They can release every text I've ever sent any day now.
[00:53:39.119 --> 00:53:39.459]  I don't know.
[00:53:39.679 --> 00:53:40.420]  They've got it all.
[00:53:43.803 --> 00:53:46.745]  So, oh, let's go look at all Ginny Thomas' texts and emails.
[00:53:46.765 --> 00:53:51.289]  And they want to read it all because they want to know what we're up to, know what you're up to, know what the Thomas family is up to.
[00:53:51.409 --> 00:53:52.510]  These are sick freaks, folks.
[00:53:53.837 --> 00:53:58.018]  And, uh, they'll leak those to the Washington Post, and then they'll cherry-pick stuff to make her look bad.
[00:54:00.998 --> 00:54:01.738]  Boy, oh boy.
[00:54:01.939 --> 00:54:03.019]  Really something else, isn't it?
[00:54:03.699 --> 00:54:05.739]  No transparency for Democrats, though.
[00:54:05.779 --> 00:54:11.620]  They get to do whatever the hell they want, and nobody ever knows how Nancy Pelosi makes $200 million as a congresswoman.
[00:54:13.641 --> 00:54:20.362]  And, of course, the Democrat terrorists are making death threats to Representative Loudermilk.
[00:54:22.304 --> 00:54:32.810]  I want to see a shank in your throat, GOP representative Loudermilk releases audio of numerous leftist death threats after Liz Cheney's January 6th committee and media smears.
[00:54:34.751 --> 00:55:02.641]   Yeah, and of course, they're trying to make this claim that Loudermilk was showing January 6th protesters around the Capitol and around the tunnels Like he was some sort of a organizer that planned on, I don't know, kidnapping or hurting Democrat members of Congress when they tried to escape through the tunnels?
[00:55:03.401 --> 00:55:05.042]  I mean, that's what they're trying to argue.
[00:55:05.062 --> 00:55:07.862]  And of course it's all BS, it's all made up.
[00:55:08.443 --> 00:55:11.904]  And so now the terrorist Democrats are sending him death threats.
[00:55:12.044 --> 00:55:15.565]  So how long will it be till a Democrat terrorist shows up to try to assassinate him?
[00:55:17.079 --> 00:55:19.060]  And if the Democrats have their way, he'll be disarmed.
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:20.481]  And there won't be any police.
[00:55:20.841 --> 00:55:22.661]  So you'll only have Democrat terrorists with guns.
[00:55:23.422 --> 00:55:24.902]  That's how that will go.
[00:55:25.803 --> 00:55:32.066]  Serial liar Adam Schiff urges DOJ to pursue criminal charges against Trump for engaging in alleged multiple criminal acts.
[00:55:32.586 --> 00:55:33.046]  Oh yes.
[00:55:33.686 --> 00:55:35.047]  Yes, I'm sure Adam Schiff.
[00:55:35.447 --> 00:55:38.628]  The guy that promised us he had evidence of Trump-Russia collusion.
[00:55:39.089 --> 00:55:41.270]  The guy that promised us he'd show us that evidence.
[00:55:42.489 --> 00:55:45.932]  He never had the evidence, and so therefore he never showed us the evidence.
[00:55:46.313 --> 00:55:47.614]  He's a liar.
[00:55:48.575 --> 00:55:49.136]  Adam Schiff.
[00:55:50.317 --> 00:55:56.443]  J6 prisoner punished with diesel therapy, and his public defender is missing in action.
[00:55:56.943 --> 00:56:00.227]  He was turned over to the FBI by a Bumble date.
[00:56:01.268 --> 00:56:17.802]   Bumble is a dating app, and he meets some girl on Bumble, And she starts prying and probing about January 6th, and then eventually gets enough information from him to send it to the FBI, and then they go arrest him.
[00:56:17.983 --> 00:56:20.924]  Now he's being tortured in a Democrat gulag.
[00:56:25.905 --> 00:56:26.686]  Pretty amazing, isn't it?
[00:56:28.486 --> 00:56:28.986]  But imagine.
[00:56:31.727 --> 00:56:36.429]  The Democrat Party is the largest domestic terror group in this country's history.
[00:56:37.677 --> 00:56:41.168]  And they want to disarm civilians, and they want to defund the police.
[00:56:42.168 --> 00:56:51.830]  And then they publish the addresses of their political enemies, they publish the address of their political enemies' children's schools, and they send their terrorists there with guns.
[00:56:52.570 --> 00:57:00.452]  So imagine, if Democrats get their way, you won't be able to have a gun, there'll be no police, and then they'll send terrorists to your house to kill you, and you won't have any way of defending yourself.
[00:57:00.632 --> 00:57:01.112]  Sound fun?
[00:57:01.572 --> 00:57:04.813]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have been a bad boy.
[00:57:05.213 --> 00:57:10.034]  I did not do my job in that first hour and tell you about InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:10.414 --> 00:57:11.534]  We gotta pay the bills around here.
[00:57:12.807 --> 00:57:15.491]  We gotta make sure the crew is paid so that we can be up and on the air.
[00:57:16.051 --> 00:57:16.933]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:57:17.093 --> 00:57:26.425]  Folks, I was asking because our supplements are so good, they sell out a lot, and so I have to check before I promote something that it's still in stock, sadly.
[00:57:27.827 --> 00:57:29.628]  It's the Biden supply chain crisis.
[00:57:29.728 --> 00:57:32.130]  Plus, it's just how popular these supplements are.
[00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:34.351]  I'm drinking Fizzy Magnesium today.
[00:57:34.391 --> 00:57:36.853]  Guys, if you do a little dot cam here, just so people can see.
[00:57:36.893 --> 00:57:38.654]  I mean, people know I don't make stuff up.
[00:57:38.934 --> 00:57:40.935]  You know, we're the most trusted name in news, Infowars.
[00:57:40.955 --> 00:57:42.296]  But I've got my Fizzy Magnesium here.
[00:57:42.316 --> 00:57:44.778]  I've been sipping on it throughout the transmission.
[00:57:45.598 --> 00:57:48.600]  And I just got to tell you, I love the Fizzy Magnesium drink.
[00:57:49.201 --> 00:57:51.682]  It is one of my favorite drinks.
[00:57:52.983 --> 00:57:57.146]  And you could just market this as just an orange drink.
[00:57:58.544 --> 00:58:06.767]  You may remember orange drink mixes growing up like Tang and Sunny D and this stuff and kids liked drinking it because it tasted good, it was a great orange flavor.
[00:58:07.607 --> 00:58:14.850]  Well, we could just market this as a fantastic orange drink mix because it's pretty much the best orange drink mix I've ever had.
[00:58:15.530 --> 00:58:21.392]  And I remember, I mean, I would drink Sunny D as a kid or my mom would make a pitcher of Tang and me and my dad loved drinking Tang.
[00:58:22.292 --> 00:58:23.052]  This is better.
[00:58:24.113 --> 00:58:24.953]  And it's healthy.
[00:58:26.134 --> 00:58:27.194]  So it's a total win-win.
[00:58:28.325 --> 00:58:34.370]  Fizzy magnesium drink mix, the best tasting orange drink you're going to have, plus it's healthy.
[00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:37.012]  Most people are deficient in magnesium.
[00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:43.435]  And magnesium is one of the key factors in enzyme function in the body.
[00:58:43.735 --> 00:58:47.098]  It's the key factor for enzyme function in the body.
[00:58:47.198 --> 00:58:48.540]  And most people are deficient.
[00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:50.482]  No wonder we see so many health problems.
[00:58:50.902 --> 00:58:54.345]  So, we took care of that problem with Fizzy Magnesium.

[00:59:53.979 --> 00:59:56.081]  I went to space and drank some Fizzy Magnesium.
[00:59:56.221 --> 00:59:57.201]  You can see me right there.
[00:59:57.401 --> 01:00:01.044]  It's black and white, you know, it's hard to get the technology up there in space.
[01:00:02.144 --> 01:00:04.065]  But we did it.
[01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:06.187]  We got Fizzy Magnesium and we drank it in space.
[01:00:07.611 --> 01:00:07.951]  No!
[01:00:08.311 --> 01:00:09.212]  Better than Tang!
[01:00:09.252 --> 01:00:10.232]  It's Fizzy Magnesium.
[01:00:10.332 --> 01:00:10.713]  All right.
[01:00:10.993 --> 01:00:17.456]  So that's available at InfoWarsStore.com as well as so many huge discounts on top-selling, top-rated supplements.
[01:00:17.496 --> 01:00:18.877]  Part of the super summer sale.

[01:00:21.138 --> 01:00:22.038]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:23.019]  All right, let me do this.
[01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:26.060]  I said we would go back to Rand Paul and Anthony Fauci.
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:26.861]  Let's do that now.
[01:00:28.889 --> 01:00:31.330]  This is a real telling moment.
[01:00:32.090 --> 01:00:37.171]  Anthony Fauci is not as much a doctor as he is a criminal money thief.
[01:00:38.332 --> 01:00:44.574]  And that seems to be what Senator Paul exposes here in clip five.
[01:00:46.274 --> 01:00:47.374]  Another question for you.
[01:00:47.594 --> 01:00:55.937]  The NIH continues to refuse to voluntarily divulge the names of scientists who receive royalties and from which companies.
[01:00:57.262 --> 01:01:07.295]  Over the period of time from 2010 to 2016, 27,000 royalty payments were paid to 1,800 NIH employees.
[01:01:07.696 --> 01:01:13.523]  We know that, not because you told us, but because we forced you to tell us through the Freedom of Information Act.
[01:01:14.264 --> 01:01:19.570]  Over $193 million was given to these 1800 employees.
[01:01:20.311 --> 01:01:29.902]  Can you tell me that you have not received a royalty from any entity that you ever oversaw the distribution of money in research grants?
[01:01:31.807 --> 01:01:34.869]  Um, well first of all, let's talk about royalties.
[01:01:34.889 --> 01:01:36.690]  That's the question, no that's the question.
[01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:40.712]  Have you ever overseen, have you ever received a royalties payment from a company?
[01:01:40.732 --> 01:01:42.553]  Here guys, pause it right there for me real quick.
[01:01:42.893 --> 01:01:46.175]  Pause it right there for me real quick and rewind it ten seconds or so.
[01:01:47.515 --> 01:01:51.678]  Because I want you guys to just listen to that again and understand.
[01:01:53.018 --> 01:01:54.979]  All Fauci had to say was no.
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:56.820]  That's all he had to say.
[01:01:57.681 --> 01:01:58.361]  But he didn't.
[01:01:59.221 --> 01:02:00.022]  Why didn't he?
[01:02:01.704 --> 01:02:03.584]  Because the answer is obviously yes.
[01:02:05.205 --> 01:02:09.385]  So just, I want to replay that part because that's the key pivotal part of this.
[01:02:10.666 --> 01:02:12.026]  And he'll go on back and forth with Rand Paul.
[01:02:12.666 --> 01:02:16.307]  Why doesn't Anthony Fauci answer Rand Paul's question with no?
[01:02:16.907 --> 01:02:18.167]  All he had to do was say no.
[01:02:19.207 --> 01:02:20.007]  But he's under oath.
[01:02:20.367 --> 01:02:21.228]  So he doesn't want to lie.
[01:02:21.628 --> 01:02:22.548]  So he doesn't say no.
[01:02:23.128 --> 01:02:24.288]  But he also doesn't want to say yes.
[01:02:24.948 --> 01:02:27.149]  Because, well, that would be pretty revealing, wouldn't it?
[01:02:27.509 --> 01:02:28.689]  So listen to it one more time.
[01:02:29.502 --> 01:02:31.583]  Why doesn't Anthony Fauci just say no?
[01:02:33.184 --> 01:02:38.486]  Over $193 million was given to these 1800 employees.
[01:02:39.226 --> 01:02:48.810]  Can you tell me that you have not received a royalty from any entity that you ever oversaw the distribution of money in research grants?
[01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:53.800]  Well, first of all, let's talk about royalties.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:54.601]  That's the question.
[01:02:54.641 --> 01:02:55.603]  No, that's the question.
[01:02:55.643 --> 01:03:03.194]  Have you ever received a royalty payment from a company that you later oversaw money going to that company?
[01:03:03.971 --> 01:03:06.473]  You know, I don't know is a fact, but I doubt it.
[01:03:06.773 --> 01:03:09.435]  Well, here's the thing is, why don't you let us know?
[01:03:09.455 --> 01:03:10.856]  He doesn't know my ass.
[01:03:10.916 --> 01:03:12.818]  How much you've gotten and from what entities?
[01:03:13.278 --> 01:03:14.759]  The NIH refuses.
[01:03:14.899 --> 01:03:20.924]  Look, we ask them, we ask them, the NIH, we ask them whether or not who got it and how much.
[01:03:21.084 --> 01:03:22.105]  They refuse to tell us.
[01:03:22.385 --> 01:03:23.766]  They sent it redacted.
[01:03:24.286 --> 01:03:25.187]  Here's what I want to know.
[01:03:25.267 --> 01:03:26.388]  It's not just about you.
[01:03:26.748 --> 01:03:31.752]  Everybody on the Vaccine Committee, have any of them ever received money from the people who make vaccines?
[01:03:32.032 --> 01:03:32.873]  Can you tell me that?
[01:03:33.433 --> 01:03:38.294]  Can you tell me if anybody on the vaccine approval committees ever received any money from people who live in the vaccines?
[01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:39.495]  Are you going to let me answer a question?
[01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:42.736]  Soundbite number one, are you going to let me answer a question?
[01:03:43.836 --> 01:03:45.776]  Okay, so let me give you some information.
[01:03:45.836 --> 01:03:55.879]  First of all, according to the regulations, people who receive royalties are not required to divulge them, even on their financial history.
[01:03:55.899 --> 01:03:56.119]  Interesting.
[01:03:56.139 --> 01:03:56.719]  Pause it right there.
[01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:57.700]  Well, there we go.
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:03:59.780]  Okay, so we have the answer here.
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.081]  So let's go ahead and change that regulation.
[01:04:02.101 --> 01:04:02.601]  How about that?
[01:04:03.447 --> 01:04:06.449]  Let's get, let's, you know, we love hearing about transparency so much.
[01:04:06.469 --> 01:04:07.610]  It's all about transparency, right?
[01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:08.870]  Let's get a little transparency.
[01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:10.611]  Let's end that regulation.
[01:04:10.651 --> 01:04:15.054]  Let's end that rule that protects corrupt bureaucrats like Anthony Fauci.
[01:04:15.334 --> 01:04:15.915]  How about that?
[01:04:16.795 --> 01:04:18.156]  And by the way, he's like, you're gonna let me answer?
[01:04:18.176 --> 01:04:18.816]  You're gonna let me answer?
[01:04:18.996 --> 01:04:20.237]  He still hasn't answered the question.
[01:04:20.817 --> 01:04:21.478]  Still hasn't done it.
[01:04:23.639 --> 01:04:24.660]  But thank you, Fauci.
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:27.882]  Thank you for telling us that you guys protect your criminal enterprise.
[01:04:29.093 --> 01:04:37.762]  By writing rules that say you don't have to divulge how much money you're getting paid off by these private corporations to do their bidding in the government.
[01:04:38.462 --> 01:04:40.645]  So all we gotta do now is change that rule.
[01:04:40.985 --> 01:04:46.270]  So I hope Rand Paul heard that loud and clear and I hope Rand Paul moves to change that rule.
[01:04:46.871 --> 01:04:49.874]  But here guys, just rewind it 10 seconds and let's finish the clip here.
[01:04:51.647 --> 01:04:53.208]  Okay, so let me give you some information.
[01:04:53.528 --> 01:04:59.318]   Can you tell me if anybody on the vaccine approval committees ever received any money from people who live in
[01:04:59.318 --> 01:05:00.008]  the vaccine?
[01:05:00.008 --> 01:05:02.887]   Soundbite number one, are you going to let me answer a question?
[01:05:02.887 --> 01:05:09.848]   Okay, so let me give you some information. First of all, according to the regulations,
[01:05:09.848 --> 01:05:16.968]   people who receive royalties are not required to divulge them even on their financial statement
[01:05:16.968 --> 01:05:19.207]  according to the Bayh-Dole Act.
[01:05:19.441 --> 01:05:20.562]  So let me give you some examples.
[01:05:20.582 --> 01:05:21.263]  So let's change that.
[01:05:21.403 --> 01:05:29.822]   from 2015 to 2020, I, the only royalties I have,
[01:05:29.822 --> 01:05:36.103]   was my lab and I made a monoclonal antibody for use in vitro reagent
[01:05:36.103 --> 01:05:38.102]  that had nothing to do with patients.
[01:05:38.706 --> 01:05:43.347]  And during that period of time, my royalties range from $21 a year to $1,700 a year.
[01:05:43.167 --> 01:05:51.086]   dollars a year to $1,700 a year and the average per year was a hundred and
[01:05:51.086 --> 01:05:56.526]   ninety-one dollars and forty-six cents. It's all redacted and you
[01:05:56.526 --> 01:06:01.487]  can't get any information on the 1800 scientists.
[01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:03.982]  Senator Paul, your time is long over expired.
[01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:06.645]  Senator Paul, your time is long over expired.
[01:06:06.685 --> 01:06:08.507]  I gave you an additional two and a half minutes.
[01:06:08.587 --> 01:06:09.789]  The witness has responded.
[01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:10.850]  We are going to move on.
[01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:11.711]  Senator Sanders.
[01:06:12.509 --> 01:06:16.415]  Alright, so, I mean, liberals call for transparency all day long.
[01:06:16.455 --> 01:06:19.440]  They're the ones, transparency, transparency, we need transparency.
[01:06:19.801 --> 01:06:21.243]  So, alright, let's come together.
[01:06:21.784 --> 01:06:25.750]  The right, the left, Democrats, Republicans, let's come together for transparency.
[01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:27.332]  Let's end that rule.
[01:06:28.922 --> 01:06:35.444]  That keeps royalties paid off, government employees paid off by royalties.
[01:06:35.484 --> 01:06:37.164]  Let's make those informations public.
[01:06:37.604 --> 01:06:39.705]  You're being lied to about the war in Ukraine.
[01:06:39.745 --> 01:06:40.465]  Of course you are.
[01:06:40.585 --> 01:06:46.527]  You've been lied to about every war in my lifetime at least, in my 32 years on this planet.
[01:06:48.607 --> 01:06:49.988]  Pretty much been lied to about every war.
[01:06:50.908 --> 01:06:52.388]  And most of the wars before that too.
[01:06:52.669 --> 01:06:54.009]  So they're lying to you about Ukraine.
[01:06:55.384 --> 01:07:02.486]  But, you know, the Bidens really don't want that money laundering operation, that proxy state in Ukraine, to go away.
[01:07:03.046 --> 01:07:14.029]  So even though everyone else is backing off and not wanting to deal with it, Zelensky's still working for the West now, and they just continue to propagandize the planet.
[01:07:15.421 --> 01:07:18.303]  With Zelensky and the lies about what's going on in Ukraine.
[01:07:18.984 --> 01:07:21.786]  President Zelensky appears as 3D hologram.
[01:07:22.647 --> 01:07:27.912]  Tells tech leaders Ukraine will lead global digital revolution if they fund reconstruction.
[01:07:27.952 --> 01:07:28.232]  Yes.
[01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:29.113]  Yes.
[01:07:30.214 --> 01:07:33.717]  Let America unofficially have a war with Russia in Ukraine.
[01:07:34.818 --> 01:07:39.121]  And then Ukraine will be the bastion of the tech revolution.
[01:07:39.161 --> 01:07:40.643]  I mean, talk about propaganda.
[01:07:40.683 --> 01:07:41.924]  Talk about bullcrap.
[01:07:43.072 --> 01:07:46.973]  And I mean, they've really got this, uh, Zelensky to go along with all of it.
[01:07:47.933 --> 01:07:49.133]  So who owns Zelensky?
[01:07:50.154 --> 01:07:50.634]  And why?
[01:07:51.934 --> 01:07:59.456]  Or is he just making billions of dollars off of this giant charade that nobody else is playing, by the way?
[01:07:59.916 --> 01:08:01.576]  I cannot emphasize this enough, folks.
[01:08:02.937 --> 01:08:08.674]   The only country That is really fully bought in and playing the charade is the United States.
[01:08:09.434 --> 01:08:14.618]  Most European countries, NATO countries, EU countries, they're pretty much balking.
[01:08:15.579 --> 01:08:26.747]  I mean, they may provide some lip service for Biden's war in Ukraine against Russia, but other than that, they're pretty much balking, and even the lip service has kind of exhausted itself.
[01:08:28.148 --> 01:08:31.270]  With even Macron saying, look, we're done in Ukraine.
[01:08:31.911 --> 01:08:34.153]  I don't know what else we're supposed to do here.
[01:08:34.872 --> 01:08:38.675]  Unless you want us to have a full-blown war with Russia, which apparently is what the globalists want.
[01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:41.998]  Smarter minds have prevailed thus far.
[01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:45.493]  But Russia won.
[01:08:45.513 --> 01:08:49.155]  I don't know if you could say it's over, but Russia has won.
[01:08:49.215 --> 01:08:51.116]  They've pretty much done everything they've set out to do.
[01:08:51.836 --> 01:09:07.826]  They've captured and taken care of the Nazis that were there, the Azov Battalion, and they have freed eastern Ukraine from the grips of such groups and other CIA front groups and proxy groups and the wars that were constantly going on there for years.
[01:09:08.986 --> 01:09:11.529]  That's all over now, thanks to Russia and Putin.
[01:09:12.290 --> 01:09:19.277]  And the eastern Ukraine region is celebrating Putin and celebrating Russia for finally doing this.
[01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:25.744]  And now Russia controls the Crimea region, which is really the gem of the region.
[01:09:26.465 --> 01:09:28.787]  And the entire eastern front has been liberated.
[01:09:29.488 --> 01:09:31.129]  And the rest of Ukraine is pretty much back to normal.
[01:09:31.889 --> 01:09:33.050]  But then there's the US.
[01:09:33.891 --> 01:09:38.134]  Money laundering, weapons laundering, who knows what's really going on.
[01:09:39.055 --> 01:09:41.637]  But it's sick, and you've been lied to about it the entire time.
[01:09:42.898 --> 01:09:48.262]  Now, in other developments, Israel secretly coordinates Syria airstrikes with the United States.
[01:09:48.302 --> 01:09:50.965]  Are they about to go after Assad again, folks?
[01:09:51.385 --> 01:10:14.012]   Let me tell you right now, that's the kind of thing that could turn this situation into much worse, because Syria has a good relationship with Russia, and Assad has a good relationship with Putin, and it's, I mean, Putin's been on record before, you know, basically saying the U.S., telling the U.S.
[01:10:14.032 --> 01:10:16.193]  stop bullying Syria, leave Syria alone.
[01:10:16.753 --> 01:10:18.054]  And Trump did for the most part.
[01:10:18.755 --> 01:10:25.659]  I think he kind of engaged in a little bit of propaganda in Syria, just to kind of do it and get it over with.
[01:10:27.793 --> 01:10:29.874]  But Syria was much better off when Trump was in office.
[01:10:30.014 --> 01:10:34.255]  Is it about to be another bad place with Israel and the U.S.
[01:10:34.295 --> 01:10:37.096]  sending proxy groups in there and arming proxy groups in there?
[01:10:37.437 --> 01:10:37.997]  Or who knows?
[01:10:38.017 --> 01:10:51.842]  I mean, maybe all these weapons going into Ukraine, maybe that was just a smoke screen and they're actually sending those weapons into the region to eventually fall into the hands of terrorists and CIA proxy groups to go in and try to take out Assad.
[01:10:54.128 --> 01:10:56.469]  So, this is not an insignificant thing.
[01:10:56.509 --> 01:10:58.270]  We'll see if it develops any further.
[01:10:59.191 --> 01:11:03.694]  America is making sure the IDF attacks don't interfere with their operations in the country, U.S.
[01:11:03.714 --> 01:11:04.374]  officials claim.
[01:11:04.854 --> 01:11:07.596]  Israel strikes against Iranian-linked targets in Syria.
[01:11:08.096 --> 01:11:13.059]  That's, again, Iran and Russia are going to end up in a strong relationship out of this if this continues.
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:18.983]  And then you'll have China and Iran and Russia and India and the U.S.
[01:11:19.023 --> 01:11:21.244]  sitting there with Biden's thumb up his butt.
[01:11:22.699 --> 01:11:24.880]  Israel strikes against Iran.
[01:11:25.421 --> 01:11:29.443]  Linked targets in Syria have been carried out with the secret approval of the U.S.
[01:11:29.483 --> 01:11:31.884]  military, the Wall Street Journal is reporting.
[01:11:34.505 --> 01:11:41.429]  So, just more proxy wars, more regime wars, more territory wars that the West and Israel are running in the region.
[01:11:42.970 --> 01:11:44.831]  It's just, it needs to stop, folks.
[01:11:45.111 --> 01:11:46.412]  It just, it needs to stop.
[01:11:47.152 --> 01:11:48.193]  And we pay for all of it.
[01:11:49.013 --> 01:11:49.373]  Sadly.
[01:11:51.515 --> 01:11:51.835]  Sadly.
[01:11:52.745 --> 01:11:53.765]  And then there's Taiwan.
[01:11:55.146 --> 01:11:59.427]  Taiwan touts ability to attack Beijing with supersonic cruise missiles.
[01:12:00.067 --> 01:12:02.688]  Boy, oh boy, is that some aggressive rhetoric out of Taiwan.
[01:12:03.328 --> 01:12:22.925]   Taiwanese officials are now touting that they possess an advanced cruise missile which is capable of hitting locations on the Chinese mainland, which could be launched as a counter-strike in the event of a Chinese military invasion of the island, which I think everyone is kind of expecting now, because Here's what's happened.
[01:12:24.766 --> 01:12:39.114]  China sees what Biden is doing in Ukraine, and China understands that what's really going on is that Biden has unofficially and illegally launched a war against Russia, and Ukraine is just the battlefront.
[01:12:40.175 --> 01:12:47.079]  Now, that situation has either played itself out or calmed down, at least for the meantime.
[01:12:47.639 --> 01:12:50.181]  But so China says, oh, I see your strategy, Biden.
[01:12:51.164 --> 01:12:56.790]  You unofficially launch wars, but then don't tell anyone what you're actually doing is war against Russia.
[01:12:57.311 --> 01:12:58.332]  That's an interesting strategy.
[01:12:58.692 --> 01:13:00.094]  I think we'll do that in Taiwan.
[01:13:01.736 --> 01:13:08.723]  And it's almost as if they're doing it intentionally as a snide to Joe Biden and the West.
[01:13:09.935 --> 01:13:13.178]  Saying, oh, we're having a non-war intervention in Taiwan.
[01:13:13.218 --> 01:13:19.002]  Like, I mean, to me that's a blatant thumb in the eye of Joe Biden and the West.
[01:13:19.563 --> 01:13:21.204]  Making fun of what we're doing in Ukraine.
[01:13:21.704 --> 01:13:22.505]  That's how I see it.
[01:13:24.366 --> 01:13:26.528]  Like, oh, we're having a non-war intervention.
[01:13:27.509 --> 01:13:27.729]  What?
[01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:33.313]  No, that's China making fun of Biden and the West and what they're doing in Ukraine.
[01:13:34.694 --> 01:13:34.975]  So!
[01:13:37.156 --> 01:13:41.940]  If China goes into Taiwan, they'll just say, hey, wait a second, this is a non-war intervention.
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:43.361]  This is like what you're doing in Ukraine.
[01:13:43.381 --> 01:13:44.082]  This isn't a war.
[01:13:44.102 --> 01:13:47.084]  We're just, hey, you know, we're just moving in here.
[01:13:47.404 --> 01:13:48.686]  We're just sending weapons in here.
[01:13:49.546 --> 01:13:51.448]  We're just sending money in here and artillery.
[01:13:51.488 --> 01:13:52.268]  It's non-war.
[01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:57.493]  Yeah, just some aircraft carriers and stuff, but it's non-war.
[01:13:58.133 --> 01:13:59.955]  It's like what you guys are doing in Ukraine, right?
[01:14:00.235 --> 01:14:00.575]  Right?
[01:14:00.695 --> 01:14:01.176]  Yeah.
[01:14:04.011 --> 01:14:05.131]  And I don't know what the U.S.
[01:14:05.831 --> 01:14:08.032]  is gonna do if China goes into Taiwan.
[01:14:08.092 --> 01:14:14.773]  In fact, sadly, I think China may test it soon to find out that Biden will do nothing.
[01:14:16.973 --> 01:14:29.936]  Now, if China does go into Taiwan, and they start, the communists start taking over the manufacturing there and the industry there, we're in big trouble.
[01:14:30.723 --> 01:14:31.724]  Big, big trouble.
[01:14:32.084 --> 01:14:35.608]  You thought we had a microchip shortage during COVID.
[01:14:37.009 --> 01:14:54.589]   If China goes into Taiwan and takes control of those microchip factories and other production means in Taiwan, and they choose to not send those goods to the West anymore, Oh yeah, you're going to really see things start to get bad.
[01:14:55.029 --> 01:15:02.272]  The Biden supply chain crisis, the Biden economic collapse will continue because the Biden foreign policy has been such a disaster.
[01:15:03.412 --> 01:15:20.498]  You know, I want to follow up that last segment, try to explain what's happening geopolitically right now, because I really don't understand this, but no one else in the American media is really addressing this issue.
[01:15:22.287 --> 01:15:25.471]  I would assume some understand it, at least to an extent.
[01:15:27.114 --> 01:15:29.277]  But I don't see anybody really addressing this issue.
[01:15:29.697 --> 01:15:32.081]  Now, I know why our politicians aren't addressing it.
[01:15:32.141 --> 01:15:33.222]  Most of them are in on it.
[01:15:34.584 --> 01:15:36.086]  Both Republicans and Democrats.
[01:15:39.090 --> 01:15:48.573]  With just all the crimes that have been coming out of D.C., the lying to get us into wars, the money laundering, the insider trading, I mean, just, you know, all of it that's been going on.
[01:15:49.433 --> 01:15:55.875]  And so here's what is happening on the world stage right now that nobody is talking about.
[01:15:57.895 --> 01:15:58.635]  The U.S.
[01:15:59.136 --> 01:16:05.417]  has been at the head of the international table probably since World War II.
[01:16:05.457 --> 01:16:07.378]  Let's say since World War II, mostly.
[01:16:08.598 --> 01:16:09.098]  The U.S.
[01:16:09.138 --> 01:16:11.360]  has been at the head of the international table.
[01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:22.687]  And a lot of the global marketplace is dictated by what the U.S.
[01:16:22.767 --> 01:16:26.190]  is doing and what the United States foreign policy is.
[01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:42.747]  And for the most part, it's been good for the planet, and it's been an amicable relationship with these other countries, because we send them a bunch of money, probably pay off their politicians, and, you know, cut deals.
[01:16:44.828 --> 01:16:50.190]  And then we've always kind of had the bedrock of the control factor of the U.S.
[01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:53.751]  dollar being what's used for gas purchases, for petro.
[01:16:53.971 --> 01:16:54.711]  It's a petro dollar.
[01:16:56.769 --> 01:16:57.649]  But here's what's happened.
[01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:18.215]  Other world leaders and other countries that are coming of age and becoming fully developed and becoming independent and starting to make their own trade deals and other deals with other countries are realizing that it's not even about whether they need the U.S.
[01:17:18.255 --> 01:17:18.615]  or not.
[01:17:19.355 --> 01:17:23.897]  It's about, holy crap, the U.S.
[01:17:23.997 --> 01:17:33.061]   keeps sending Illegitimate, mentally ill, insane wackos as their leaders.
[01:17:35.804 --> 01:17:47.214]  So imagine you're at, let's say, a board meeting, and the head of the board is just a complete lunatic and a whack job.
[01:17:48.911 --> 01:18:00.256]  So, you don't think that the other members of that board that are sitting that aren't the head of the table, you don't think there's going to be grumblings like, hey boy, you know, this guy's kind of lost his mind, this guy's kind of tanking everything, you know, what can we do?
[01:18:01.137 --> 01:18:08.200]  You don't think people are going to start chattering and talking and figure out ways to get rid of that head of the table, get rid of that whack job at the head of the table?
[01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.101]  Folks, that's what's going on right now with Joe Biden.
[01:18:13.182 --> 01:18:16.644]  So, the world is about to leave the U.S.
[01:18:16.684 --> 01:18:17.004]  behind.
[01:18:19.614 --> 01:18:37.304]  And there's going to be a new international power structure that's forming right now, which is going to be China and Russia and Iran and India, and then in the West, in the Americans, in the Americas, probably Mexico and Brazil, maybe even Argentina.
[01:18:39.746 --> 01:18:40.286]  And the U.S.
[01:18:40.306 --> 01:18:41.767]  could go either way here.
[01:18:41.827 --> 01:18:42.227]  The U.S.
[01:18:42.247 --> 01:18:45.529]  could get in on this if we have good leadership, or the U.S.
[01:18:45.569 --> 01:18:49.131]  can be left behind if we have leaders like Joe Biden or Hillary Clinton.
[01:18:50.285 --> 01:18:51.526]  But so that's what's going on.
[01:18:52.147 --> 01:19:04.038]  We've sent Joe Biden to be the head of the table, and he's a complete whacked out, crapping his pants, forgets where he's at, geriatric old criminal from a family of sexual deviants.
[01:19:04.778 --> 01:19:05.919]  The whole world knows it now.
[01:19:07.921 --> 01:19:17.053]   And so all the other leaders of these other countries are starting to talk saying, hey, This guy who's at the head of the table, he's a complete disaster.
[01:19:17.573 --> 01:19:19.813]  He is a serious problem.
[01:19:20.293 --> 01:19:29.655]  And so they're starting to cut their own deals, they're starting to make their own little power structures, they're starting to figure out their own relationships, their own marketplaces, and they're leaving the U.S.
[01:19:29.855 --> 01:19:30.436]  behind.
[01:19:32.476 --> 01:19:34.856]  And see, the Western elite and the U.S.
[01:19:35.597 --> 01:19:41.898]  political class has been so corrupted and detached from reality for so long that they can't even believe it.
[01:19:42.904 --> 01:19:51.206]  They can't even imagine that the day would ever come where their power and influence would be removed from under them like a rug.
[01:19:52.446 --> 01:19:53.766]  But that's what's happening, folks.
[01:19:55.587 --> 01:19:58.167]  The world is deciding to leave the U.S.
[01:19:58.207 --> 01:20:02.268]  behind because they can't deal with Joe Biden.
[01:20:05.289 --> 01:20:31.535]   And so it appears to me now the trend is that you're going to have Europe And you're going to have America, United States of America and Canada that are going to be the only ones left here twiddling their thumbs and playing with their ding-a-lings because they're so obsessed with the global homo corruption world government with their sycophantic elites like Bill Gates and the rest of the world is just done.
[01:20:32.916 --> 01:20:34.237]  And they haven't even figured it out yet.
[01:20:36.317 --> 01:20:43.822]  And I'm just amazed that more in the media haven't figured this out, or they're not talking about it, because that's what's going on.
[01:20:45.723 --> 01:20:48.746]  So, the whole globalist movement has actually already failed.
[01:20:49.426 --> 01:20:50.467]  It's already dead on arrival.
[01:20:51.007 --> 01:20:52.748]  Russia's never going into the New World Order.
[01:20:53.068 --> 01:20:54.730]  China's never going into the New World Order.
[01:20:55.609 --> 01:20:57.249]  India is never going into the New World Order.
[01:20:57.329 --> 01:20:59.050]  Mexico is never going into the New World Order.
[01:20:59.370 --> 01:21:01.370]  Saudi Arabia is never going into the New World Order.
[01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:03.671]  The UAE is never going into the New World Order.
[01:21:03.951 --> 01:21:05.691]  Brazil is never going into the New World Order.
[01:21:06.031 --> 01:21:08.472]  So, globalism has failed.
[01:21:09.192 --> 01:21:10.092]  It has failed.
[01:21:10.252 --> 01:21:10.992]  It's done.
[01:21:11.312 --> 01:21:14.093]  The corporate global government is done.
[01:21:14.193 --> 01:21:16.674]  Klaus Schwab's pipe dream is dead.
[01:21:17.614 --> 01:21:22.555]  Now, they might be able to conquer the European Union and countries in Europe.
[01:21:23.482 --> 01:21:27.724]  And they might be able to conquer the United States and Canada, but that's all they're going to have.
[01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:39.588]  But that's fine, they'll have us as their subjects as they view it, and they'll force-vaccinate us, force your kids to be gay, they'll make it illegal to own property, they'll make you eat bugs.
[01:21:39.868 --> 01:21:41.569]  That's their plan, they've bragged about it.
[01:21:42.009 --> 01:21:50.733]   And the only parts of the planet that seem to be willing to go along with this now Are the United States of America, Canada, and the European Union.
[01:21:51.053 --> 01:21:52.554]  The rest of the world is done.
[01:21:52.954 --> 01:21:56.256]  They're done dealing with geriatric old criminals like Joe Biden.
[01:21:56.796 --> 01:22:02.178]  They don't want to hear from some psychotic maniac in a Darth Vader outfit, Klaus Schwab.
[01:22:03.439 --> 01:22:17.584]   So, see, our media, our elite, our power structure is so detached from reality, And so high off of their own excrement that they don't even realize that this is what's going on.
[01:22:18.845 --> 01:22:21.769]  And they couldn't even comprehend it if they could.
[01:22:23.392 --> 01:22:24.814]  They're being left behind, folks.
[01:22:25.935 --> 01:22:26.095]  Now...
[01:22:28.362 --> 01:22:31.244]  If there's a silver lining to this, that might be a good thing.
[01:22:31.784 --> 01:22:48.094]  Because how else is the US going to get rid of this corrupt political elite class, this ruling class, this political regime class, this deep state, if we don't even know that that's the case?
[01:22:50.235 --> 01:23:06.279]   So this can be a major wake-up call as some of the most corrupt politicians in US history are, you know, In their last moments here, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton, I mean, they're done.
[01:23:06.319 --> 01:23:07.700]  Like, they can't be around forever.
[01:23:09.642 --> 01:23:20.971]  So they're just hoping that they can hand the platter over to the Klaus Schwabs, the Yoval Hararis, and others in the new corporate world government, except it's not there.
[01:23:22.071 --> 01:23:22.892]  It doesn't exist.
[01:23:23.072 --> 01:23:23.733]  Nobody wants it.
[01:23:25.512 --> 01:23:45.762]  So it's almost like there's an expiration date on this deep state, and when they think that they're going to be handing the baton to the UN and the WHO and the World Economic Forum, except it's already dead on arrival.
[01:23:45.942 --> 01:23:54.646]  It's all just self-service, lip service, and pipe dreams of tyrannical, psychotic maniacs.
[01:23:57.205 --> 01:24:03.647]  So, I just, you know, we have the most informed audience out there, and I'm not really seeing this being covered anywhere else.
[01:24:03.687 --> 01:24:06.987]  So I'm just trying to explain it the best I can, and it's way beyond my pay grade.
[01:24:07.507 --> 01:24:10.648]  And I've tried my best here in this 10-minute segment, but that's what's going on.
[01:24:11.068 --> 01:24:12.909]  The rest of the world is leaving the U.S.
[01:24:12.929 --> 01:24:18.630]  behind because we're sending Joe Biden as our leader to the head of the table, and nobody wants to deal with him.
[01:24:19.030 --> 01:24:20.090]  Nobody wants to talk to him.
[01:24:20.971 --> 01:24:21.911]  Nobody respects him.
[01:24:23.010 --> 01:24:33.213]  Nobody wants to be around him and the world actually wants to go into a new industrial revolution that empowers humanity as the globalists like Klaus Schwab are trying to enslave it.
[01:24:34.833 --> 01:24:39.014]  So, don't be surprised if the U.S.
[01:24:39.334 --> 01:24:44.255]  loses its place in the world, the world power structure.
[01:24:45.215 --> 01:24:49.777]  Don't be surprised because it's in the process right now.
[01:24:49.837 --> 01:24:59.067]   Now, I have a feeling The way the other world leaders are looking at this situation is I think they're willing to give the U.S.
[01:24:59.187 --> 01:25:17.914]   one more shot and if we can get the next presidential election right, meaning we don't send a geriatric old pedophile criminal to the White House or some other corrupt deep state globalist So maybe a Trump or a DeSantis or somebody else.
[01:25:17.954 --> 01:25:28.517]  If we send someone who's not a total psycho-globalist, who's not a total criminal to the table, to the White House, then maybe the rest of the world leaders will treat us with respect and dignity again.
[01:25:29.277 --> 01:25:31.118]  But if not, I think they're just going to leave us behind.
[01:25:31.138 --> 01:25:32.398]  They're going to start cutting their own deals.
[01:25:32.418 --> 01:25:34.939]  They're going to take, nobody's going to deal with the US dollar anymore.
[01:25:35.019 --> 01:25:35.999]  The dollar will collapse.
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.260]  It's just, it's going to be...
[01:25:39.977 --> 01:25:41.298]  The total collapse of the United States.
[01:25:41.998 --> 01:25:44.099]  If we don't get the next presidential election right, I believe.
[01:25:44.839 --> 01:25:45.680]  And I believe the rest.
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:46.440]  Because see, here's the thing.
[01:25:46.961 --> 01:26:07.231]  Are you really surprised as Biden and our leaders are busy playing with rainbow dildos and promoting pedophilia and grooming children and Biden administration appointees are men that think they're women and dudes that dress up as dogs to have doggy puppy sex play?
[01:26:09.141 --> 01:26:14.164]  And they brag about how their 10IQ press secretary is black and gay?
[01:26:14.424 --> 01:26:15.305]  Like that means something?
[01:26:15.985 --> 01:26:16.265]  Really?
[01:26:16.305 --> 01:26:24.430]  You're surprised that Saudi Arabia and Russia and China and Brazil and the UAE, you're surprised they don't want to deal with this crap?
[01:26:25.511 --> 01:26:26.731]  They want new energy!
[01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:28.132]  They want innovation!
[01:26:28.352 --> 01:26:29.673]  They want infrastructure!
[01:26:29.833 --> 01:26:31.094]  They want technology!
[01:26:31.274 --> 01:26:32.455]  They want production!
[01:26:34.110 --> 01:26:35.792]  And then what do they get from Western leaders?
[01:26:36.132 --> 01:26:36.652]  Gay!
[01:26:37.073 --> 01:26:37.633]  Gay!
[01:26:38.154 --> 01:26:38.794]  Trans!
[01:26:39.435 --> 01:26:40.376]  Rainbow flag!
[01:26:40.436 --> 01:26:41.296]  Gay pride!
[01:26:44.159 --> 01:26:45.280]  It's not going to go on forever.
[01:26:46.481 --> 01:26:47.022]  So the U.S.
[01:26:47.102 --> 01:26:51.185]  is going to be left behind and lose our standing as the world power and our way of life will be gone.
[01:26:51.506 --> 01:26:52.587]  Our standard of living gone.
[01:26:53.547 --> 01:26:55.289]  And you'll see the rest of these countries take off.
[01:26:57.351 --> 01:26:59.513]  But I think they're going to give the U.S.
[01:26:59.653 --> 01:27:00.434]  one more shot.
[01:27:01.556 --> 01:27:06.498]  In 2024 to send somebody to the White House who's not a geriatric old pedophile criminal.
[01:27:07.499 --> 01:27:08.820]  But that's where things are at.
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:14.162]  I'm going to stop talking ad nauseum about that and move on to the rest of the news here.
[01:27:14.182 --> 01:27:21.566]  But first, before I do that, ladies and gentlemen, your immune system is the key to your health.
[01:27:23.383 --> 01:27:33.750]  And that's why the globalists, the population control agenda artists, are trying to inject you with something that destroys your immune system, the COVID vaccine.
[01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:34.910]  They call it vaccine AIDS.
[01:27:35.911 --> 01:27:43.356]  And we cover these news stories all the time, covered it yesterday, how now children that are vaccinated are basically living with three viruses 24-7.
[01:27:43.376 --> 01:27:46.938]  They're sick now because the COVID vaccine destroyed their immune system.
[01:27:47.258 --> 01:27:48.059]  They knew it would do that.
[01:27:49.431 --> 01:27:51.632]  Well, we're not the globalists that want you dead.
[01:27:52.112 --> 01:27:56.754]  We want you to live a happy and healthy life, and we understand the immune system is the key to that.

[01:30:07.432 --> 01:30:07.753]  Okay.
[01:30:08.933 --> 01:30:13.195]  Let's get some of these video clips played here, guys.
[01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:16.251]  Let's see what I want to go to here.
[01:30:17.571 --> 01:30:18.932]  Let's go to Lauren Boebert.
[01:30:20.113 --> 01:30:21.834]  Man, I just like her more and more every day.
[01:30:22.634 --> 01:30:24.215]  And that's why the left hates her so much.
[01:30:24.255 --> 01:30:25.175]  She tells it like it is.
[01:30:25.215 --> 01:30:32.259]  And so here she is telling it like it is, calling out AOC's lies of her experience on January 6th in clip three.
[01:30:32.699 --> 01:30:37.802]  I do think it was interesting that they postponed the hearings today for January 6th.
[01:30:37.922 --> 01:30:40.543]  I think they're looking to do this on June the 16th.
[01:30:41.063 --> 01:30:43.364]  Do you know why they ended up postponing the hearings?
[01:30:43.384 --> 01:30:44.345]  Do we have a reason for that?
[01:30:46.213 --> 01:30:49.554]  I'm sure they're wanting to drum up more attention, but I don't know.
[01:30:51.535 --> 01:30:59.437]  Unfortunately, these members who are running this committee, they don't operate on logic, and you cannot debate reality with these people.
[01:31:00.137 --> 01:31:04.359]  Whenever this comes up, they exaggerate so much of this.
[01:31:04.659 --> 01:31:06.339]  I mean, look at AOC.
[01:31:06.659 --> 01:31:07.920]  Everything goes back to her.
[01:31:09.520 --> 01:31:11.863]  Possibly being raped on January 6th?
[01:31:12.103 --> 01:31:19.591]  Why does everything come back to people want to have some sort of sexual encounter with her anytime that there's an incident?
[01:31:19.671 --> 01:31:23.435]  I don't know what her obsession is with that, but this is what we're hearing from Democrats.
[01:31:23.455 --> 01:31:30.522]  So you can even debate reality, certainly with everyday policies, and I wouldn't expect the same with January 6th.
[01:31:31.906 --> 01:31:45.014]  Folks, I gotta tell you, as a lover of life, and as a lover of this country, and what it stands for, represents, and has done for the world, I don't like seeing the deep divide and crevasse now that is forming in our political discourse.
[01:31:45.214 --> 01:32:00.803]  However, however, justice be done, may the heavens fall, truth be told, may the heavens fall, I'm relieved that Lauren Boebert and John Kennedy and others are finally calling out the Democrats for what they are, psychotic nut jobs.
[01:32:01.869 --> 01:32:03.229]  That don't live in reality.
[01:32:03.849 --> 01:32:04.990]  And domestic terrorists.
[01:32:06.270 --> 01:32:07.230]  That's just the truth!
[01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:14.312]  Believe me, folks, I... I don't know how to explain it.
[01:32:14.372 --> 01:32:28.030]   It's not like... I don't like the fact, and it's true, I don't like the fact that me just coming on air telling the truth Adds to the political divide in that country.
[01:32:28.490 --> 01:32:29.051]  In this country.
[01:32:29.451 --> 01:32:29.991]  That hurts me.
[01:32:30.091 --> 01:32:30.632]  I don't like that.
[01:32:30.912 --> 01:32:32.233]  I'm not going to stop telling the truth!
[01:32:34.174 --> 01:32:36.435]  So, I don't like this deep political divide.
[01:32:36.455 --> 01:32:37.716]  I don't like where it's taking us.
[01:32:38.236 --> 01:32:46.261]  However, the left has gone so far out of this world, that there's really nothing else you can do.
[01:32:46.501 --> 01:32:53.746]  Just being a centrist, next to one of these radical fascistic leftists, there's going to be a huge divide.
[01:32:53.766 --> 01:32:54.826]  I mean, just look at Elon Musk.
[01:32:55.066 --> 01:32:55.687]  Perfect example.
[01:32:56.690 --> 01:33:05.155]  So I don't like the deep divide and the chasm that we have politically in this country right now, but I am relieved.
[01:33:06.816 --> 01:33:20.584]  It is like a breath of fresh air to finally have politicians willing to say it like it is about the Democrats, and they're just done fearing the media, done fearing the Democrat backlash, because they've realized these people are psychotic nutjobs.
[01:33:21.365 --> 01:33:22.926]  Why am I still dealing with them?
[01:33:25.034 --> 01:33:35.659]  So, I don't like the political divide, I don't like the fact that the rhetoric can be divisive, but Justice be Dan, may the heavens fall, truth be told, may the heavens fall, Lauren Boebert is right.
[01:33:36.159 --> 01:33:38.340]  These Democrats do not live in reality.
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:40.601]  You cannot have adult discussions with them.
[01:33:40.821 --> 01:33:41.802]  They're like children.
[01:33:42.802 --> 01:33:44.563]  The children are running the daycare.
[01:33:44.603 --> 01:33:46.064]  The children are driving the bus.
[01:33:46.224 --> 01:33:49.946]  It's time for the adults to take control again, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:33:50.585 --> 01:33:54.564]   gentlemen kinda like this gentleman did in italy and clip fifteen
[01:33:54.564 --> 01:33:58.645]   guys some global warming protesters are trying to block the road and uh...
[01:33:58.645 --> 01:34:06.423]   the adults showed up to shut that down here in clip fifteen
[01:34:06.423 --> 01:34:10.264]   and i don't think that's not allowed to have a look at the other hand they
[01:34:10.264 --> 01:34:16.984]   literally drag them off the road yeah don't you don't you lives no you got a super glue
[01:34:16.984 --> 01:34:19.185]   yourself now That's the new thing.
[01:34:19.205 --> 01:34:26.511]  You gotta superglue yourself to the road, or superglue yourself to the basketball hoop, or superglue yourself to the tennis net, or superglue yourself to the Starbucks bar.
[01:34:27.552 --> 01:34:28.553]  So they made the big mistake.
[01:34:28.573 --> 01:34:30.455]  They didn't superglue their asses to the pavement.
[01:34:31.135 --> 01:34:32.917]  And so they literally got dragged off the road.
[01:34:33.877 --> 01:34:35.379]  But this is the proper response.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:48.122]   And you know, Again, I like peace, I like love, but boy oh boy, I mean, if you wrote a law saying if someone's on the road and you can run them over, I think that would end this real quick, wouldn't it?
[01:34:48.842 --> 01:34:49.863]  Probably end this real quick.
[01:34:49.883 --> 01:34:50.903]  So that's what we have to do.
[01:34:51.223 --> 01:34:55.266]  This is how these leftists, these liberals, these Democrats, these children need to be treated.
[01:34:55.666 --> 01:34:57.807]  Like the petulant brat children they are.
[01:34:58.827 --> 01:35:01.629]  So, you probably didn't hear about this yesterday.
[01:35:02.869 --> 01:35:05.391]  One dead, two injured in Alabama church shooting.
[01:35:06.690 --> 01:35:09.251]  Is it another targeted attack of a church?
[01:35:10.411 --> 01:35:10.911]  We're not sure.
[01:35:10.931 --> 01:35:12.292]  The investigation is ongoing.
[01:35:12.932 --> 01:35:15.093]  But why didn't you hear about this one in the media?
[01:35:15.173 --> 01:35:17.774]  Well, they don't want you to see the churches under attack.
[01:35:19.074 --> 01:35:22.115]  And a good guy with a gun stopped the shooting.
[01:35:22.855 --> 01:35:28.357]  And so you see, they don't cover those events because that doesn't work with their agenda and their propaganda.
[01:35:28.697 --> 01:35:29.958]  See, that's how that goes.
[01:35:30.018 --> 01:35:35.940]  Now, I've already covered it this week, but I've got to do it again because this to me is so important.
[01:35:37.830 --> 01:35:41.158]  Now, I'm not the biggest gun guy.
[01:35:42.185 --> 01:35:43.845]  I'm not really big into gun culture.
[01:35:43.885 --> 01:35:44.766]  I'm not into hunting.
[01:35:45.106 --> 01:35:52.008]  I'm a huge Second Amendment activist because I see how important it is, and I like going and shooting sometimes, and I like having nice guns.
[01:35:52.348 --> 01:35:55.649]  I like having different kinds of guns and learning about them and shooting them.
[01:35:56.249 --> 01:36:03.091]  I really do enjoy shooting skeet with my shotgun, but I'm not the biggest gun guy, so this isn't like me, the big gun guy, coming here freaking out about this.
[01:36:03.651 --> 01:36:15.578]   I understand why the Second Amendment exists, and I understand that the current policy and agenda of the Democrat Party is so dangerous, it's unreal that they're even promoting it.
[01:36:16.719 --> 01:36:19.721]  Disarm civilians and defund the police?
[01:36:20.722 --> 01:36:22.543]  While we have a wide open southern border?
[01:36:22.603 --> 01:36:23.664]  I mean, come on, man.
[01:36:25.846 --> 01:36:32.310]  That's what I'm saying, like, there's two things that should show you just how destructive Democrat Party policy is.
[01:36:32.511 --> 01:36:34.672]  We have an open southern border and a welfare state.
[01:36:34.852 --> 01:36:35.513]  That's impossible.
[01:36:35.813 --> 01:36:36.454]  That can't exist.
[01:36:38.043 --> 01:36:40.905]  That'll end, that'll cause serious destruction and chaos, it is.
[01:36:41.745 --> 01:36:44.927]  And you can't disarm civilians and defund police.
[01:36:46.728 --> 01:36:50.490]  Again, these are two Democrat policies that they're engaged in.
[01:36:52.871 --> 01:37:03.417]  But that's what I'm saying is, I'm not the big gun guy, I don't show off guns, take pictures with guns, I'm not the big NRA guy, the big rifle guy, that's not who I am.
[01:37:05.987 --> 01:37:08.472]  So, like, don't think, oh, this is just a gun guy telling me about this.
[01:37:08.492 --> 01:37:10.336]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:37:10.597 --> 01:37:12.300]  This is a serious threat to our freedom.
[01:37:13.403 --> 01:37:14.184]  So, but think about it.
[01:37:15.273 --> 01:37:19.535]  Democrats publish the address of Supreme Court Justices.
[01:37:20.135 --> 01:37:25.497]  Democrats tell their voters where Republicans are having a baseball practice with no security.
[01:37:26.158 --> 01:37:31.960]  Democrats publish the addresses of Supreme Court Justices' children.
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:35.922]  Democrats publish the addresses of news media people they don't like.
[01:37:36.362 --> 01:37:37.062]  And then what happens?
[01:37:37.282 --> 01:37:41.284]  Democrat terrorists show up at their house, sometimes trying to kill them!
[01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:47.002]  Okay, so that's Democrats trying to kill their political opposition.
[01:37:47.482 --> 01:37:58.867]  And then when there's a bill on the floor to have extra security at Supreme Court justices' houses after a Democrat just tried to assassinate one of them, Democrats vote against it.
[01:37:59.347 --> 01:38:01.288]  Now you tell me they don't want you dead.
[01:38:01.628 --> 01:38:05.149]  You tell me they are not already in a Civil War mindset.
[01:38:06.650 --> 01:38:10.751]  They haven't promoted it yet, ladies and gentlemen, but the Democrats are already in a Civil War mindset.
[01:38:10.911 --> 01:38:12.012]  They have political prisoners.
[01:38:13.424 --> 01:38:24.226]  They have politicized kangaroo court hearings, and they try to kill their political opposition if they can't censor them and silence them from speaking on the internet.
[01:38:25.287 --> 01:38:25.827]  Or arrest them.
[01:38:26.807 --> 01:38:36.409]  So Democrat terrorists send their assassins to Supreme Court justices' houses, a bill is proposed to send extra security there, and Democrats vote against it.
[01:38:36.629 --> 01:38:38.609]  You're telling me these people aren't in civil war mode?
[01:38:39.009 --> 01:38:41.150]  You're telling me these people don't want their opposition dead?
[01:38:44.056 --> 01:38:48.119]  And then I love this, you know, oh, they're always against the wealthy class, they're always against the rich.
[01:38:48.819 --> 01:38:51.661]  Lawmaker introduces bill to tax assault weapons 1,000%.
[01:38:52.541 --> 01:38:54.243]  Who do you think's going to have the guns then?
[01:38:56.584 --> 01:38:59.946]  Who do you think is going to have all the guns if you tax assault weapons 1,000%?
[01:39:00.106 --> 01:39:02.308]  You think it's going to be the little guy?
[01:39:02.328 --> 01:39:07.411]  You think it's going to be the woman that lives in a bad area that might need a gun to protect herself and her family?
[01:39:07.931 --> 01:39:09.132]  No, she's not going to be able to afford it.
[01:39:09.192 --> 01:39:10.093]  She's going to be a victim now.
[01:39:10.393 --> 01:39:13.255]  The Democrats love making victims out of law-abiding citizens.
[01:39:14.411 --> 01:39:15.371]  It's really just amazing stuff.
[01:39:15.651 --> 01:39:23.253]  Oh, but now they've proposed, and they're actually doing this in schools, some Texas school districts to require clear backpacks in the wake of Uvalde's shooting.
[01:39:23.613 --> 01:39:24.654]  That'll do it, guys.
[01:39:25.374 --> 01:39:26.774]  The clear backpack.
[01:39:26.814 --> 01:39:28.174]  That'll stop the next school shooter.
[01:39:28.214 --> 01:39:29.295]  These people are insane.
[01:39:30.115 --> 01:39:33.876]  Oh my gosh, Eric Swalwell, one of the biggest liars in U.S.
[01:39:33.916 --> 01:39:43.323]   political history, who may be involved in a money laundering operation, In Qatar, that's being investigated by the FBI, but he's a Democrat, so I'm sure he'll skirt any responsibility.
[01:39:43.684 --> 01:39:45.045]  But he just put this tweet out.
[01:39:45.685 --> 01:39:47.326]  I'm gonna have a little call to action here.
[01:39:48.907 --> 01:39:56.092]  He put a tweet out saying, breaking, when you go into Hunter Biden's laptop, open Google and search who tried to violently overthrow the US government, this is what you get.
[01:39:56.133 --> 01:39:56.893]  It's a picture of Trump.
[01:39:57.834 --> 01:39:59.095]  Haha, Eric Swalwell.
[01:39:59.775 --> 01:40:00.556]  You're so funny.
[01:40:00.776 --> 01:40:04.478]  I think you farting on camera is probably the comedy you should stick to.
[01:40:05.678 --> 01:40:10.360]  And so I think people should go to this tweet from Eric Swalwell here.
[01:40:10.400 --> 01:40:14.802]  You guys can put my phone quickly on the dash cam so people can see this, or the dot cam rather.
[01:40:15.803 --> 01:40:17.043]  This is the Eric Swalwell tweet.
[01:40:17.063 --> 01:40:20.705]  Sorry, it's kind of hard to see here on my phone, but the crew can pull it up back there.
[01:40:21.766 --> 01:40:24.587]  I think people should go and find that tweet from Rep.
[01:40:24.787 --> 01:40:26.228]  Swalwell, at Rep.
[01:40:26.448 --> 01:40:27.828]  Swalwell, Rep.
[01:40:27.888 --> 01:40:32.671]  Eric Swalwell, and they should go upload all the pictures from Hunter Biden's laptop.
[01:40:32.771 --> 01:40:35.072]  You know, Hunter Biden doing crack, Hunter Biden making porn.
[01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:39.770]  Hunter Biden with doing drugs with what appear to be minors or even family members.
[01:40:41.570 --> 01:40:49.452]  Yeah, so I think people should go on there and upload all the photos that are actually on Hunter Biden's laptop for Eric Swalwell to see.
[01:40:49.512 --> 01:40:50.512]  Maybe he hasn't seen them.
[01:40:50.972 --> 01:40:51.772]  Yeah, like that one.
[01:40:51.912 --> 01:40:52.513]  There's a goody.
[01:40:53.593 --> 01:40:54.953]  Imagine that's the last thing you see.
[01:40:56.033 --> 01:40:59.074]  Or the first thing you see when you wake up like, oh, am I in hell?
[01:41:01.010 --> 01:41:02.953]  Smartest guy Joe knows.
[01:41:03.674 --> 01:41:04.555]  Smartest guy he knows.
[01:41:04.595 --> 01:41:06.497]  Is that before or after Hunter smokes the Parm?
[01:41:07.178 --> 01:41:07.779]  The Parm cheese?
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:12.505]  Hunter Biden responsible for more people trying to smoke Parmesan cheese than anyone else ever.
[01:41:12.865 --> 01:41:16.130]  And he himself said he's probably smoked more Parmesan cheese than anyone else ever.
[01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:17.732]  10% for the big guy.
[01:41:20.351 --> 01:41:21.871]  10% for the big guy.
[01:41:22.592 --> 01:41:23.792]  Hey guys, let's do this.
[01:41:23.832 --> 01:41:28.273]  This is an awkward clip from Joe Biden during a press conference today.
[01:41:29.233 --> 01:41:32.013]  And we had another sudden adult death syndrome.
[01:41:32.673 --> 01:41:38.734]  And it happened to, I guess, a friend or family member of somebody that was in attendance at this speech he gave.
[01:41:39.254 --> 01:41:43.015]  And an awkward moment here from Mushmouth in clip one.
[01:41:43.615 --> 01:41:45.896]  Spoke to the CEO, Joanne Stewart.
[01:41:45.916 --> 01:41:46.536]  Spoke to the CEO.
[01:41:46.556 --> 01:41:47.616]  I mean, just pause it, pause it.
[01:41:49.281 --> 01:41:52.688]  This guy is, he can't even talk, folks.
[01:41:54.832 --> 01:42:11.187]   See, I don't really cover much of what Joe Biden says because It's just, it's gobbledygook, it's lies, it's mush mouth, but I go and I see what he's saying, I go watch his speeches off air and stuff.
[01:42:11.827 --> 01:42:13.908]  Folks, the guy can't talk, okay?
[01:42:14.048 --> 01:42:16.669]  He literally cannot talk.
[01:42:17.449 --> 01:42:24.972]  He can't enunciate, he can't pronunciate, he slurs his words together all the time, he forgets where he's at on his teleprompter half the time.
[01:42:26.724 --> 01:42:27.224]  It's unbelievable.
[01:42:27.245 --> 01:42:29.286]  So right out of the gate.
[01:42:29.306 --> 01:42:30.387]  He doesn't even speak right.
[01:42:31.068 --> 01:42:32.269]  Just right out of the gate.
[01:42:32.789 --> 01:42:33.570]  I can't remember what he said.
[01:42:33.590 --> 01:42:37.714]  He doesn't even have correct grammar or anything.
[01:42:38.434 --> 01:42:42.117]  So here's mush mouth, marble mouth, awkward moment Joe Biden.
[01:42:42.157 --> 01:42:42.698]  I won't disrupt.
[01:42:42.738 --> 01:42:42.978]  Play it.
[01:42:43.999 --> 01:42:46.421]  I spoke to the CEO, Joanne Storrs.
[01:42:46.441 --> 01:42:47.322]  I spoke to the CEO.
[01:42:47.242 --> 01:42:49.242]  Wade, stand up so everybody sees you here.
[01:42:49.242 --> 01:42:51.242]  Wade McConnell.
[01:42:51.242 --> 01:42:53.242]  [Applause]
[01:42:53.242 --> 01:43:06.242]   And by the way, my sympathies to your family of your CFO who dropped dead very unexpectedly.
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.401]  My best to their family.
[01:43:07.481 --> 01:43:08.261]  It's tough stuff.
[01:43:09.041 --> 01:43:10.041]  But you know what he told me?
[01:43:10.781 --> 01:43:15.963]  He told me his shipping cost rose by $100 million.
[01:43:16.023 --> 01:43:17.083]  Because of you!
[01:43:17.903 --> 01:43:20.303]  More than the company's entire profit margin that year.
[01:43:20.323 --> 01:43:20.904]  Because of you!
[01:43:20.924 --> 01:43:21.304]  By $100 million.
[01:43:23.410 --> 01:43:24.391]  That's the Great Reset!
[01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:27.453]  That is the Great Reset, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:28.174 --> 01:43:30.356]  And see, that's why the Wall Street Journal has this story.
[01:43:30.516 --> 01:43:31.317]  What inflation?
[01:43:31.617 --> 01:43:33.939]  The super frugals say they were made for this moment.
[01:43:34.179 --> 01:43:36.060]  And so that's how they're going to pitch it next.
[01:43:36.080 --> 01:43:38.102]  They're going to say, hey, this is good.
[01:43:38.162 --> 01:43:40.084]  You need to learn how to be a minimalist anyway.
[01:43:40.884 --> 01:43:43.006]  You're a scourge on this planet, pesky human.
[01:43:43.386 --> 01:43:45.848]  You need to be a minimalist.
[01:43:46.209 --> 01:43:47.390]  You need to live in a pod.
[01:43:47.510 --> 01:43:48.571]  You need to eat bugs.
[01:43:49.351 --> 01:43:52.414]  And you need to just never move and never do anything because you're causing climate change.
[01:43:53.584 --> 01:43:54.765]  So that's where this is going.
[01:43:54.785 --> 01:43:58.266]  I mean, oh, yeah, the shipping costs have gone up.
[01:43:58.546 --> 01:44:01.368]  No kidding, because you've tripled the gas prices.
[01:44:02.868 --> 01:44:04.369]  And you've raised taxes.
[01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:07.571]  And you've caused a supply chain crisis.
[01:44:07.811 --> 01:44:11.353]  So yeah, the cost of everything is going up because of you, Joe Biden.
[01:44:12.933 --> 01:44:13.534]  Unbelievable.
[01:44:13.574 --> 01:44:14.454]  And it's so obvious.
[01:44:14.714 --> 01:44:16.255]  We had none of these problems under Trump.
[01:44:17.415 --> 01:44:18.496]  And then they happen under Biden.
[01:44:18.516 --> 01:44:20.297]  It's like, you don't think we know what's going on here?
[01:44:21.077 --> 01:44:22.378]  But so there's mush mouth.
[01:44:23.702 --> 01:44:24.823]  Embarrassing himself there.
[01:44:25.424 --> 01:44:34.992]  Now, liberal fact-checkers turn out to be the biggest liars you've ever met, including one at the USA Today.
[01:44:35.212 --> 01:44:39.416]  USA Today removes 23 articles after reporter caught fabricating sources.
[01:44:39.496 --> 01:44:40.317]  She just made it up.
[01:44:41.017 --> 01:44:41.638]  She's fired.
[01:44:42.138 --> 01:44:46.202]  Top fact-checker at USA Today forced to delete articles over fabricated sources.
[01:44:46.342 --> 01:44:47.543]  She's a fact-checker too.
[01:44:48.384 --> 01:44:49.125]  USA Today.
[01:44:50.128 --> 01:44:59.658]  Which is used as a fact checker by social media platforms, was forced to delete 23 articles from its website after an investigation found one of its reporters had fabricated sources.
[01:44:59.698 --> 01:45:03.583]  She made it up, and I mean, I actually kind of feel bad for her.
[01:45:04.283 --> 01:45:07.767]  She was just doing what she was trained to do as a fake news liberal.
[01:45:08.528 --> 01:45:10.130]  All you people do is lie.
[01:45:10.750 --> 01:45:16.869]   So why are you holding Poor reporter Gabrielle Miranda to higher standards than yourself.
[01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:20.274]  Hillary Clinton makes things up about Russia, tears the nation apart.
[01:45:20.315 --> 01:45:21.797]  Jussie Smollett makes things up.
[01:45:22.498 --> 01:45:25.583]  The media follows along, goes with the fake narratives.
[01:45:26.857 --> 01:45:35.482]  Why is poor Gabriela Miranda suffering for being fake news when she's just doing what everybody else on the Liberal Democrat side of the aisle does?
[01:45:36.282 --> 01:45:41.585]  So I actually feel bad for Gabriela Miranda, the fake news fact checker from USA Today.
[01:45:42.046 --> 01:45:44.867]  Gabriela, you have been unfairly treated.
[01:45:45.387 --> 01:45:46.888]  You were just doing your job.
[01:45:46.928 --> 01:45:54.112]  You were doing what all your other leaders in the fake news media do, and that's lie and make things up, and now you're being punished for it.
[01:45:54.192 --> 01:45:54.873]  Totally unfair.
[01:45:56.291 --> 01:45:58.393]  Kind of like, remember, they all loved Michael Avenatti.
[01:45:58.493 --> 01:46:01.076]  What a disaster that guy ended up turning out to be.
[01:46:02.137 --> 01:46:06.881]  Incarcerated, creepy porn lawyer, Michael Avenatti pleads guilty to fraud, tax charges in California.
[01:46:06.901 --> 01:46:08.423]  Remember, he was the hero of the liberals.
[01:46:08.443 --> 01:46:09.524]  They wanted him to run for president.
[01:46:11.414 --> 01:46:11.814]  Woo!
[01:46:12.355 --> 01:46:16.917]  New York Post correspondent accuses White House of blacklisting reporters they don't like.
[01:46:17.417 --> 01:46:18.278]  Oh, really?
[01:46:18.778 --> 01:46:21.800]  The White House only lets Democrat activists in the press corps?
[01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:23.140]  No kidding!
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:24.601]  I don't know how Peter Doocy gets in there.
[01:46:24.621 --> 01:46:29.083]  I guess because Fox News is so big, but they won't let anybody in there that's not a Democrat, folks.
[01:46:29.464 --> 01:46:29.904]  Nobody.
[01:46:31.265 --> 01:46:31.725]  Nobody.
[01:46:34.688 --> 01:46:38.170]  Yeah, and that USA Today reporter was making up stories about Trump and everything else.
[01:46:38.210 --> 01:46:39.230]  She was just doing her job.
[01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:40.551]  I feel she's being treated unfairly.
[01:46:40.891 --> 01:46:44.872]  Vice President Harris launches task force to shut down online harassment.
[01:46:44.912 --> 01:46:47.073]  This woman is a total embarrassment, guys.
[01:46:48.074 --> 01:46:52.035]  Give me clip 8, followed by clip 7, if you will.
[01:46:52.095 --> 01:46:53.996]  Let's go clip 8 and then clip 7.
[01:46:54.056 --> 01:46:57.077]  Here they are announcing their new ministry of truth.
[01:46:57.878 --> 01:47:01.699]  Well, the internet is an essential part of life in the 21st century.
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:02.880]  Can't get around it.
[01:47:03.757 --> 01:47:04.797]  Can't get around without it!
[01:47:05.878 --> 01:47:11.959]  Thank you so much for joining us today at the launch of the White House Task Force to address online harassment and abuse.
[01:47:12.619 --> 01:47:19.201]  I'd like to thank Vice President Harris for launching the task force today, along with Attorney General Garland and Surgeon General Murti.
[01:47:19.821 --> 01:47:32.425]   I'd also like to thank Dr. Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall from the National Security Council for co-chairing the task force, as well as Bharat Ramamurti from the National Humanitarian Council, Dr. Alondra Nelson, It's a task force.
[01:47:32.465 --> 01:47:33.547]  We've got a task force!
[01:47:33.467 --> 01:47:35.467]  policy and senior officials.
[01:47:35.467 --> 01:47:36.467]  There's Merrick Garland.
[01:47:36.467 --> 01:47:40.587]   Nine departments and agencies, all members of this task force for being here.
[01:47:40.587 --> 01:47:41.587]  It's a task force.
[01:47:41.587 --> 01:47:42.587]  Earlier today.
[01:47:42.587 --> 01:47:43.587]  We've got a task force.
[01:47:43.587 --> 01:47:44.587]  Presidential memorandum.
[01:47:44.587 --> 01:47:45.587]  All right.
[01:47:45.587 --> 01:47:46.587]  All right.
[01:47:46.587 --> 01:47:48.167]  That's enough from this goofball.
[01:47:48.167 --> 01:47:49.947]  So they're all glad handing one another.
[01:47:49.947 --> 01:47:51.427]  They've got a task force.
[01:47:51.906 --> 01:47:54.970]  They're gonna censor the internet, they're gonna stop cyberbullying.
[01:47:55.631 --> 01:47:56.152]  And it's up there.
[01:47:56.172 --> 01:47:57.534]  Oh, you have Merrick Garland up there.
[01:47:57.954 --> 01:47:59.096]  Oh, Merrick Garland!
[01:47:59.837 --> 01:48:02.061]  That's nice, that you can find time for a...
[01:48:03.530 --> 01:48:05.432]  Free speech censorship task force.
[01:48:05.512 --> 01:48:08.214]  I'm so glad that Merrick Garland has the time to censor free speech.
[01:48:08.694 --> 01:48:10.776]  Anything on the domestic terrorist Merrick Garland?
[01:48:11.156 --> 01:48:15.980]  Threatening to burn churches to the ground, pregnancy centers to the ground, and kill Supreme Court justices.
[01:48:16.060 --> 01:48:18.162]  Anything from the FBI or Merrick Garland on that?
[01:48:18.842 --> 01:48:19.162]  No.
[01:48:19.663 --> 01:48:23.786]  He's busy trying to figure out how to censor Democrat opposition on the internet.
[01:48:24.747 --> 01:48:25.227]  That's nice.
[01:48:25.567 --> 01:48:30.992]  Any task forces on trying to get our oil prices down and gas prices down?
[01:48:31.032 --> 01:48:32.092]  Any task forces on that?
[01:48:32.273 --> 01:48:32.533]  No.
[01:48:33.806 --> 01:48:38.371]  No, they're trying to censor free speech on the internet and turn your kid LGBTQIA+.
[01:48:39.953 --> 01:48:41.455]  Just amazing the priorities, isn't it?
[01:48:42.917 --> 01:48:45.459]  Just amazing the priorities.
[01:48:46.361 --> 01:48:53.429]  Kind of like the Air Force, who put out their new ad today, or yeah, or look at that, there's Jean Pierre and the man that thinks it's a woman.
[01:48:54.431 --> 01:48:56.252]  Bragging about how gay they are?
[01:48:56.873 --> 01:48:57.413]  That's nice.
[01:48:57.453 --> 01:49:00.235]  The country's totally falling apart, but we're gay!
[01:49:00.676 --> 01:49:03.157]  Like the Air Force, recruiting, pride in all who serve.
[01:49:03.177 --> 01:49:06.760]  They're not flying an American flag, they're flying the gay flag!
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:10.423]  So yeah, your country's falling apart and you're losing your future, but hey, it's gay!
[01:49:11.203 --> 01:49:20.410]  What is with our leaders, our politicians' obsession with their sex life and making that public and sexualizing and grooming children?
[01:49:20.490 --> 01:49:22.311]  It's a really odd thing.
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:28.504]  That their sexual perversions and deviations are something they like to wear on their sleeve and brag about now.
[01:49:29.084 --> 01:49:32.886]  It's usually something you want to keep to yourself and keep private, but not anymore.
[01:49:32.967 --> 01:49:38.370]  Now they want to brag about it and they want to show children their genitals too, and they call it Liberal Drag Queen Storytime Pride Month.
[01:49:39.071 --> 01:49:48.857]  It's really just pedophilia and sexual perversion is what it is with the guise of Pride Month or Drag Queen for Kids or something else.
[01:49:49.758 --> 01:49:52.800]  No, it's straight up just perverts and pedophiles is what it is.
[01:49:54.298 --> 01:50:11.667]  Now, I've got the continuation here showing the obsession with it, but I'm, um, I'm hesitant to even show this stuff on screen because it's so inappropriate, but it's like, they say it's for kids!
[01:50:12.567 --> 01:50:27.214]   So, I mean, they rub fake breasts, it's men walking around with big fake rubber breasts, rubbing it in kids' faces, and men walking around with an inflatable, like, two-foot penis, That sprays, that they walk around and spray it on kids.
[01:50:27.415 --> 01:50:28.935]  I'm not even kidding you folks, this is what they do.
[01:50:29.575 --> 01:50:32.315]  And it's like, I can't even show that on TV.
[01:50:33.936 --> 01:50:36.376]  But then they go out and they say, oh, this is entertainment for kids.
[01:50:37.736 --> 01:50:38.937]  But the obsession continues.
[01:50:38.957 --> 01:50:41.237]  This is the mayor of New York City, Eric Adams.
[01:50:42.397 --> 01:50:52.799]  Drag storytellers and the libraries and schools that support them are advancing a love of diversity, personal expression, and literacy that is core to what our city embraces.
[01:50:53.814 --> 01:50:55.596]  That's an odd way of describing sex abuse.
[01:50:56.257 --> 01:51:01.002]  At a time when our LGBTQ plus communities are under increased attack across this country.
[01:51:01.402 --> 01:51:04.446]  You know they keep saying that, where?
[01:51:04.586 --> 01:51:08.010]  Can somebody give me any evidence as to where that's going on?
[01:51:09.311 --> 01:51:10.012]  What does that even mean?
[01:51:10.272 --> 01:51:10.973]  Are you kidding me?
[01:51:11.273 --> 01:51:12.994]  Every corporate logo is gay now.
[01:51:13.354 --> 01:51:15.436]  Every major sports league is gay now.
[01:51:15.776 --> 01:51:17.918]  Every politician brags about how gay they are.
[01:51:18.518 --> 01:51:22.381]  We fly pride flags above the American flag on government buildings now.
[01:51:22.681 --> 01:51:25.223]  The Air Force waves a pride flag, not an American flag.
[01:51:25.964 --> 01:51:26.624]  What are you talking about?
[01:51:26.825 --> 01:51:30.868]  The whole gay, pride, LGBTQ+, is shoved in our face!
[01:51:32.756 --> 01:51:34.157]  What do you mean they're under attack?
[01:51:34.337 --> 01:51:36.438]  They've never been more celebrated and embraced!
[01:51:36.958 --> 01:51:37.598]  Under attack?
[01:51:37.798 --> 01:51:38.979]  My ass!
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:42.481]  They're forcing it on children.
[01:51:42.501 --> 01:51:43.821]  They're forcing it in the schools.
[01:51:43.841 --> 01:51:45.422]  They're forcing it in the corporations.
[01:51:45.642 --> 01:51:47.403]  They're forcing it in sports leagues.
[01:51:47.743 --> 01:51:49.304]  It's everywhere!
[01:51:49.664 --> 01:51:51.485]  You can't even avoid it!
[01:51:52.586 --> 01:51:54.687]  And then they say, oh, they're under attack.
[01:51:54.887 --> 01:51:56.388]  No, we're under attack!
[01:51:57.466 --> 01:51:59.488]  We're under attack with all your gayness.
[01:52:00.268 --> 01:52:03.731]  We're under attack with all your sexual perversions and deviations.
[01:52:04.091 --> 01:52:06.072]  We're under attack with your child grooming.
[01:52:06.653 --> 01:52:08.935]  It's not the LGBTQ community under attack.
[01:52:09.115 --> 01:52:10.516]  They're attacking everyone else!
[01:52:11.903 --> 01:52:13.284]  But I feel bad because you know what?
[01:52:13.624 --> 01:52:17.025]  They don't speak for all gay people or all trans people or all bi people or anything else.
[01:52:17.585 --> 01:52:24.248]  The average person out there that falls under the LGBTQIA whatever umbrella, they don't want this crap.
[01:52:24.708 --> 01:52:25.849]  They're not total perverts.
[01:52:25.889 --> 01:52:27.550]  They want to keep their life to themselves.
[01:52:28.010 --> 01:52:29.471]  They don't want to groom children.
[01:52:30.031 --> 01:52:32.232]  It's all these damn liberal pedophiles that are doing it.
[01:52:32.432 --> 01:52:35.953]  And then they say, oh, oh, we're under attack.
[01:52:36.113 --> 01:52:38.054]  LGBTQ, oh, it's under attack.
[01:52:38.114 --> 01:52:38.795]  It's under threat.
[01:52:38.815 --> 01:52:39.435]  Oh my gosh.
[01:52:40.438 --> 01:52:43.439]  And then meanwhile, just the normal average person turns on the TV.
[01:52:43.739 --> 01:52:44.260]  I'm gay!
[01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:45.700]  Turns on the internet.
[01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:46.480]  I'm gay!
[01:52:46.901 --> 01:52:47.701]  Goes to a ballgame.
[01:52:47.941 --> 01:52:48.521]  I'm gay!
[01:52:49.122 --> 01:52:50.222]  Watches a ballgame on TV.
[01:52:50.322 --> 01:52:50.862]  I'm gay!
[01:52:51.322 --> 01:52:52.283]  Steps outside the door.
[01:52:52.343 --> 01:52:53.363]  Corporate logo on a banner.
[01:52:53.443 --> 01:52:53.984]  I'm gay!
[01:52:54.344 --> 01:52:55.104]  Goes onto the bus.
[01:52:55.124 --> 01:52:55.984]  Corporate logo on a bus.
[01:52:56.124 --> 01:52:56.685]  I'm gay!
[01:52:57.665 --> 01:52:58.425]  Walks down the street.
[01:52:58.725 --> 01:52:59.506]  Gay pride parade.
[01:52:59.546 --> 01:53:00.366]  It's like, oh wow!
[01:53:00.946 --> 01:53:02.727]  Oh yeah, they're under attack alright.
[01:53:02.787 --> 01:53:02.947]  No.
[01:53:03.307 --> 01:53:06.869]  Everyone else is under attack by these sexual deviants.
[01:53:07.950 --> 01:53:08.871]  We're under attack.
[01:53:09.111 --> 01:53:11.073]  Average, normal people are under attack.
[01:53:11.433 --> 01:53:13.035]  Not the LGBTQ+.
[01:53:13.896 --> 01:53:15.978]  Everyone else is under attack by them.
[01:53:17.319 --> 01:53:19.381]  But then the mayor of New York City goes on.
[01:53:20.442 --> 01:53:24.006]  We must use our education systems to educate.
[01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:26.571]  Yeah, they want to groom children.
[01:53:26.991 --> 01:53:27.611]  It's what they're doing.
[01:53:27.851 --> 01:53:31.754]  It's pedophile under any other name, but it's liberal.
[01:53:31.814 --> 01:53:33.294]  It's Pride Month, so they get away with it.
[01:53:33.935 --> 01:53:39.378]  The goal is not only for our children to be academically smart, but also emotionally intelligent.
[01:53:40.918 --> 01:53:45.641]  The words of a mentally disturbed freak show.
[01:53:47.122 --> 01:53:48.002]  And they're so obsessed.
[01:53:48.122 --> 01:53:51.124]  So, they had to make Buzz Lightyear gay.
[01:53:52.325 --> 01:53:54.386]  Now, first of all, this is from Patricia Heaton.
[01:53:55.285 --> 01:54:00.068]  Who's a famous actress who's not a total liberal a-hole, so she gets blacklisted now.
[01:54:00.669 --> 01:54:01.989]  But she does her own thing, good for her.
[01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:10.055]  Saw the trailer for Buzz Lightyear, and all I can say is Disney-Pixar made a huge mistake not casting Tim Allen for the role.
[01:54:11.209 --> 01:54:15.513]  Tim is Buzz, why would they completely castrate this iconic, beloved character?
[01:54:16.113 --> 01:54:17.234]  You guys know why, right?
[01:54:17.294 --> 01:54:22.139]  You guys know why they didn't invite Tim Allen to be the voice of Buzz Lightyear, right?
[01:54:22.179 --> 01:54:22.779]  We all know, right?
[01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.761]  Because he's a Christian conservative white male.
[01:54:25.221 --> 01:54:25.642]  That's why.
[01:54:26.943 --> 01:54:32.428]  Tim Allen is an American patriot, he's a Christian conservative, and you're not allowed to exist in Hollywood.
[01:54:33.865 --> 01:54:35.627]  There's only two ways to exist in Hollywood.
[01:54:35.647 --> 01:54:37.429]  You either have to be a liberal or a pedophile.
[01:54:37.829 --> 01:54:41.392]  Now, luckily for Hollywood, they found that most are both, so that's what they got.
[01:54:42.233 --> 01:54:52.223]  But so, the voice of Buzz Lightyear, Tim Allen, doesn't get the movie role, the voice role of Buzz Lightyear in the new movie because he's a Christian conservative and a white male.
[01:54:53.485 --> 01:55:01.367]   But they had to make Buzz gay Countries are censoring the new Buzz Lightyear movie over a homosexual scene.
[01:55:01.828 --> 01:55:05.231]  It's not the first time Disney has had faced LGBTQ backlash.
[01:55:05.992 --> 01:55:10.355]  So most countries don't want to air gay entertainment for kids.
[01:55:11.456 --> 01:55:12.978]  So this goes back to what I was talking about earlier.
[01:55:13.498 --> 01:55:17.362]  This is why the rest of the world is moving on from the U.S., folks.
[01:55:18.766 --> 01:55:24.469]  They see us hiring men that pretend to be puppies to get their rocks off.
[01:55:24.789 --> 01:55:26.430]  They hire men that dress like women.
[01:55:26.950 --> 01:55:30.472]  They hire 10 IQ point people because they're black or gay.
[01:55:30.992 --> 01:55:31.952]  The world is done, folks.
[01:55:31.972 --> 01:55:33.313]  They don't want to deal with this clown show.
[01:55:33.533 --> 01:55:34.634]  They don't want to deal with it anymore.
[01:55:34.654 --> 01:55:35.254]  They're done with it.
[01:55:36.194 --> 01:55:36.595]  They're done.
[01:55:38.936 --> 01:55:44.678]  So, yeah, we're so obsessed with turning kids gay, the rest of the world says, that's pedophilia.
[01:55:44.879 --> 01:55:45.619]  We're not doing that.
[01:55:46.943 --> 01:55:47.564]  And then the U.S.
[01:55:47.584 --> 01:55:57.293]  just gets left behind because we're here twiddling our wieners and men are showing their wieners to kids and we say it's gay pride and it's liberal.
[01:55:58.274 --> 01:56:08.324]  But then Patricia Heaton, waking up in London to find my tweet about Buzz Lightyear generated more of a kerfuffle than my tweet about the box of aborted full-term babies found in D.C.
[01:56:08.985 --> 01:56:11.267]  Let us all ponder the state of our humanity.
[01:56:12.881 --> 01:56:19.284]  And all she said, all Patricia Heaton said was that Tim Allen should have been the voice of Buzz Lightyear.
[01:56:20.105 --> 01:56:26.388]  And that was so controversial to the left because they know why Tim Allen isn't getting the role because he's a Christian conservative.
[01:56:26.808 --> 01:56:37.834]  There was more backlash about Patricia Heaton saying Tim Allen should be Buzz Lightyear than a box of aborted babies that were aborted that were full term.
[01:56:39.966 --> 01:56:40.526]  In a box.
[01:56:41.167 --> 01:56:42.487]  Nobody seems to care about that.
[01:56:42.527 --> 01:56:44.648]  But oh, Buzz Lightyear, Tim Allen.
[01:56:44.888 --> 01:56:47.389]  Oh, that's got the left all up in a tizzy now.
[01:56:48.890 --> 01:56:50.731]  That's got them all fired up now.
[01:56:53.332 --> 01:56:54.473]  So there you go, folks.
[01:56:55.073 --> 01:56:56.734]  Is that from his show Last Man Standing?
[01:56:56.754 --> 01:56:57.454]  I've never seen that.
[01:56:58.714 --> 01:57:00.755]  Tim Allen, the last man standing in Hollywood.
[01:57:00.895 --> 01:57:01.636]  So they took him out.
[01:57:02.876 --> 01:57:04.677]  Didn't let him have the voice of Buzz Lightyear.
[01:57:05.557 --> 01:57:07.558]  He probably would have had a problem with the gay kiss, too.
[01:57:07.598 --> 01:57:08.639]  So, you know, you can't do that.
[01:57:10.183 --> 01:57:20.015]  And I'm sure, you know, you think maybe Buzz and I guess it's an interracial homosexual relationship that Buzz Lightyear is in now.
[01:57:20.315 --> 01:57:20.856]  Yay!
[01:57:20.896 --> 01:57:22.438]  The new Buzz Lightyear movie!
[01:57:22.498 --> 01:57:24.720]  It's about gay interracial sex!
[01:57:25.361 --> 01:57:27.183]  Oh my gosh, I can't wait to see it!
[01:57:27.704 --> 01:57:28.044]  Not?
[01:57:29.426 --> 01:57:29.987]  What a shame.
[01:57:31.138 --> 01:57:41.567]  They could have done something really cool with a great character from an all-time classic movie, Toy Story, and instead they gotta just make it all about gay interracial sex.
[01:57:43.409 --> 01:57:44.971]  And so, jeez, man.
[01:57:45.791 --> 01:57:50.876]  Just... And so the rest of the world is moving on from us, folks, because this is what our people are obsessed with.
[01:57:50.695 --> 01:58:10.695]  with. This is what our leaders are obsessed with.
[01:58:10.668 --> 01:58:19.072]  Alright, let me just, let me just kind of ground myself a little bit here.
[01:58:19.992 --> 01:58:31.737]  Talking about the Buzz Lightyear movie, and the crew is telling me, hey, that, that dude in the scene is not actually a dude, it's just a woman that looks like a dude, and apparently the thing is, she's a lesbian, and maybe there's some lesbian scene, I don't know.
[01:58:32.925 --> 01:58:37.836]  Uh, the point is it's like their obsession with making sure they get the LGBTQ propaganda and everything.
[01:58:38.357 --> 01:58:43.268]  But let me just, let me just kind of check myself here because... I remember the obsession.
[01:58:44.540 --> 01:59:01.526]  In the new Batman movie, there was a scene about a girl being a lesbian, and there was some kind of freak out over that, and even I was hesitant to watch it because of it, but it turned out that the whole lesbian thing in that movie had a very small impact.
[01:59:01.546 --> 01:59:07.968]  There was very small amounts of propaganda, and to this day, so far that I've seen, the new Batman movie is probably the best movie of the year so far.
[01:59:07.988 --> 01:59:10.889]  I haven't seen all of them, obviously, but it's the best one I've seen yet that come out this year.
[01:59:11.889 --> 01:59:16.971]  I don't know, maybe I'll give Buzz Lightyear a chance and just... But see, it's for kids!
[01:59:17.931 --> 01:59:21.772]  So they have to put the gay propaganda in the kids' movies, so it's still ridiculous.
[01:59:22.973 --> 01:59:24.033]  But it is what it is.
[01:59:24.093 --> 01:59:29.935]  Now, it's really even more ridiculous, because... I don't know what to do here.
[01:59:30.195 --> 01:59:33.116]  I've got... It's like...
[01:59:35.026 --> 01:59:37.007]  Do I show you this image that I have here?
[01:59:37.427 --> 01:59:59.034]  I can't show you the video, but do I show you the image from a gay pride parade where a dude is walking around with an inflatable penis that's like two feet long and it sprays and he's walking around in front of a crowd of children spraying them with an inflatable phallus.
[02:00:00.285 --> 02:00:01.426]  Like, do I show that to you?
[02:00:01.446 --> 02:00:03.207]  I mean, it's inappropriate for TV.
[02:00:03.227 --> 02:00:05.588]  You usually can't show that on TV, but they're doing it to kids.
[02:00:07.009 --> 02:00:11.952]  You know, in... Guys, find out the year for me, please.
[02:00:13.013 --> 02:00:15.294]  It couldn't have been that long ago.
[02:00:15.354 --> 02:00:20.197]  It had to be the year 2000 or 2001.
[02:00:21.698 --> 02:00:30.359]   Great German rock band, Rammstein, played a show in I think it was Utah?
[02:00:31.439 --> 02:00:32.240]  Maybe Utah.
[02:00:33.240 --> 02:00:49.208]  And they have this thing that they do, they still do it sometimes at their shows, where one of the band members takes out a fake dildo that is attached to his hip, or his torso, and pretends to use it on one of the other band members.
[02:00:54.022 --> 02:00:57.483]  They got arrested for doing that.
[02:00:58.344 --> 02:01:01.125]  I believe it was Utah in the year 2000.
[02:01:01.405 --> 02:01:03.326]  Guys, look up Till Lindemann arrest.
[02:01:04.166 --> 02:01:06.707]  And it was Till Lindemann and their keyboard player.
[02:01:07.307 --> 02:01:17.071]  They got arrested because they were performing a rock show with a dildo that he pretends that humped the rest of his bandmates with.
[02:01:17.852 --> 02:01:21.793]  And then some other times they do it where it sprays stuff out on the audience.
[02:01:22.093 --> 02:01:23.494]  That's adult entertainment.
[02:01:24.525 --> 02:01:28.950]  Marketed for adults, and now they have to do warnings about it when they do performances.
[02:01:30.372 --> 02:01:31.293]  They got arrested.
[02:01:31.333 --> 02:01:40.443]  They spent a night in jail because they were on the stage performing with a fake penis as part of their rock show.
[02:01:40.463 --> 02:01:41.044]  They got arrested.
[02:01:41.304 --> 02:01:45.008]  Well, now, it's just a normal thing!
[02:01:46.223 --> 02:02:03.629]  You just go out to a gay pride event, you go out to a drag queen story time and it's men either showing children their actual genitals hanging out of their leotards or they have these big fake breasts or big face fake penises that they rub around the children's faces.
[02:02:03.829 --> 02:02:08.650]  This guy runs around at a gay pride parade spraying people in the crowd with his fake penis.
[02:02:10.011 --> 02:02:11.051]  It's gay pride, it's liberal.
[02:02:12.291 --> 02:02:21.194]   When just 20 years ago Till Lindemann and the keyboard player for Rammstein got arrested for doing that on stage.
[02:02:21.214 --> 02:02:21.714]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:02:21.915 --> 02:02:22.415]  There's the image.
[02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:22.775]  Good job.
[02:02:22.815 --> 02:02:23.576]  So they blurred it out.
[02:02:23.636 --> 02:02:24.777]  So that's the appropriate thing to do.
[02:02:24.797 --> 02:02:25.297]  We'll blur it out.
[02:02:25.757 --> 02:02:40.928]  Yeah, that big blurred out object there, that's an inflatable penis that this man is walking around with, or woman, who knows, is walking around with at a gay pride march, spraying children in the face with this penis.
[02:02:44.079 --> 02:02:44.719]  Are you kidding me?
[02:02:44.779 --> 02:02:45.620]  That's what's going on.
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:53.224]  Again, just 20 years ago, a rock band got arrested for having a fake penis on the stage.
[02:02:53.444 --> 02:02:54.364]  Spent a night in jail.
[02:02:57.246 --> 02:02:58.486]  I'm pretty sure that was the year 2000.
[02:02:58.867 --> 02:02:59.467]  It's bothering me.
[02:02:59.647 --> 02:03:01.628]  Guys, are you trying to find that story for me?
[02:03:01.688 --> 02:03:02.268]  Yeah, there it is.
[02:03:04.209 --> 02:03:06.831]  Oh, now they... Rammstein just sells you dildos now.
[02:03:07.884 --> 02:03:09.245]  Yeah, they're a little freaky, folks.
[02:03:09.985 --> 02:03:15.208]  I'm a big fan of their music, but maybe what they're culturally into, not for children.
[02:03:15.268 --> 02:03:16.389]  But they don't market it for children.
[02:03:16.409 --> 02:03:19.051]  They're not trying to perpetuate that this is for children.
[02:03:19.651 --> 02:03:23.373]  But if you go back, I'm positive it was either 2000 or 2001.
[02:03:24.674 --> 02:03:24.854]  It was 98?
[02:03:25.254 --> 02:03:26.015]  It was 98.
[02:03:26.475 --> 02:03:27.015]  I'm being told it was 98.
[02:03:27.075 --> 02:03:29.657]  So, I mean, that's just 20 years ago, folks.
[02:03:30.537 --> 02:03:32.919]  A rock band, they're heavy metal rock.
[02:03:33.877 --> 02:03:36.020]  And they do a fake little thing with a fake penis.
[02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:37.542]  The guy runs around humping the bandmates.
[02:03:37.562 --> 02:03:38.383]  It's kind of funny.
[02:03:38.403 --> 02:03:39.124]  Maybe inappropriate.
[02:03:39.144 --> 02:03:39.925]  Maybe distasteful.
[02:03:39.945 --> 02:03:41.547]  But they got arrested.
[02:03:41.567 --> 02:03:42.168]  Spent a night in jail.
[02:03:42.428 --> 02:03:46.353]  Now a man runs around with a fake penis and sprays kids in the face with it like it's ejaculate.
[02:03:46.493 --> 02:03:48.396]  And he's celebrated as gay pride.
[02:03:49.637 --> 02:04:08.211]   I mean, again, I got a video here of a dude Um, running around, it's a, it's a drag queen for kids' events, and he's running around with big, fake breasts, like, big, like, triple-D breasts that he has, and he's running around, jumping up and down, shaking it for the kids.
[02:04:08.231 --> 02:04:09.911]  It's like, do I show that to you?
[02:04:10.351 --> 02:04:11.431]  Can I put that on the air?
[02:04:11.631 --> 02:04:13.852]  I mean, if I put that in there, is that an FCC violation?
[02:04:13.872 --> 02:04:15.732]  But, oh, it's for kids, though!
[02:04:16.312 --> 02:04:19.353]  Because you don't put that stuff on TV because a kid might see it.
[02:04:21.618 --> 02:04:23.300]  But do it for the Drag4Kid events.
[02:04:23.821 --> 02:04:26.104]  So I guess we won't put it on the screen, guys, and that's fine.
[02:04:26.124 --> 02:04:31.711]  They blurred out the image I'm telling you about here, so... We won't play that.
[02:04:32.011 --> 02:04:33.613]  But just know that that's what's going on.
[02:04:35.316 --> 02:04:37.358]  And I'll play this because, folks, I don't even know.
[02:04:37.378 --> 02:04:38.359]  I mean, this, it's just...
[02:04:39.295 --> 02:04:40.956]  We've just completely lost our minds here.
[02:04:41.136 --> 02:04:41.756]  Clip 9.
[02:04:41.996 --> 02:04:54.860]  This Pride Month, Audubon Society partnered with drag queen and intersectional environmentalist Patti Gognia to bring you Birds Tell Us, The Song of the Meadowlark.
[02:04:58.622 --> 02:05:00.962]  Yeah, there's the dude running around with the fake breasts.
[02:05:01.042 --> 02:05:02.603]  They just have it cut off so we're not showing it.
[02:05:02.843 --> 02:05:06.224]  But guys, go ahead and roll the madness that is Clip 9.
[02:05:07.384 --> 02:05:12.284]   Patti Gognia The birds tell us the song of the meadowlark.
[02:05:15.105 --> 02:05:18.126]  Ooh.
[02:05:18.506 --> 02:05:20.407]  Gay drag queen and birds, yeah.
[02:05:22.328 --> 02:05:23.108]  So hip.
[02:05:24.388 --> 02:05:25.249]  So inclusive.
[02:05:26.309 --> 02:05:27.069]  So diverse.
[02:05:28.570 --> 02:05:31.511]  Birds tell us.
[02:05:32.351 --> 02:05:35.512]  Birds tell us that the world is changing.
[02:05:35.912 --> 02:05:37.693]  That the climate is changing.
[02:05:39.799 --> 02:05:43.861]  Everyone knows birds are just CIA drones.
[02:05:43.941 --> 02:05:44.941]  Get out of here.
[02:05:45.041 --> 02:05:47.682]  Get out of here with your bird propaganda!
[02:05:50.964 --> 02:05:54.645]  Birds are fake, we all know it.
[02:05:54.465 --> 02:05:58.465]   Listen There's not
[02:05:58.465 --> 02:06:05.209]   Oh, yeah So powerful.
[02:06:05.229 --> 02:06:05.869]  Oh, it's art, alright.
[02:06:10.285 --> 02:06:13.426]  Oh my gosh, so they're shoving two forms of propaganda at you.
[02:06:13.646 --> 02:06:16.667]  Okay, well, we just went ahead and showed it, so there you go.
[02:06:16.927 --> 02:06:21.768]  There's the fake-breasted drag queen for kids, literally rubbing breasts against children.
[02:06:22.769 --> 02:06:23.529]  There it is, folks.
[02:06:23.649 --> 02:06:25.310]  I mean, that's like a three-year-old girl right there.
[02:06:25.330 --> 02:06:29.891]  This dude's running around with, like, triple-D breasts bouncing up and down for kids.
[02:06:30.431 --> 02:06:31.911]  Wait, guys, go back to the Metal Ark song.
[02:06:31.932 --> 02:06:32.572]  I'm not done with that.
[02:06:32.471 --> 02:06:33.471]  I was enjoying that.
[02:06:33.471 --> 02:06:39.671]  If we hear them or not, will we choose to listen?
[02:06:39.671 --> 02:06:41.831]  Oh boy.
[02:06:41.825 --> 02:06:42.525]  I see what you were doing.
[02:06:42.545 --> 02:06:46.046]  You were trying to play the Meadowlark song with the bouncing, uh, fake boobs there.
[02:06:46.066 --> 02:06:47.086]  For kids.
[02:06:48.026 --> 02:06:49.166]  Yeah, I mean, what are we gonna do next?
[02:06:49.226 --> 02:06:50.506]  Like, porn time for kids?
[02:06:50.626 --> 02:06:53.607]  Are we just gonna have, uh, porn education for kids in the schools?
[02:06:54.087 --> 02:06:57.068]  You know, there's a big debate on whether porn should be banned or not.
[02:06:57.388 --> 02:07:03.409]  I'm kind of a, uh, freedom absolutist, so I'm not really for banning porn.
[02:07:03.749 --> 02:07:04.469]  It's definitely a...
[02:07:05.763 --> 02:07:07.604]  A horrible drag on society.
[02:07:07.644 --> 02:07:08.264]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:07:09.245 --> 02:07:16.869]  There's no doubt that porn is a horrible, horrible drag on our society, and a poison, and a horrible drug, but I don't know if I would ban it.
[02:07:17.089 --> 02:07:20.651]  But, oh, that'll be next, is it'll be Porn 101 for kids, I'm sure.
[02:07:21.651 --> 02:07:22.892]  Because at this rate, why not?
[02:07:22.992 --> 02:07:24.232]  I mean, you're already going that direction.
[02:07:24.252 --> 02:07:32.837]  But, oh, see, in the video, it's all about, oh, we're propagandizing you with gay drag queens, and we're propagandizing you that you're killing the planet and you're bad.
[02:07:34.474 --> 02:07:36.135]  Okay, well, let's actually apply that.
[02:07:36.215 --> 02:07:39.377]  So, stop wearing all that makeup and having that crazy costume.
[02:07:39.397 --> 02:07:40.457]  How much carbon did that take?
[02:07:41.078 --> 02:07:44.860]  Alright, my final segment with you here today on the Alex Jones Show, Jay Dyer.
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:46.841]  He's going to be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:07:46.901 --> 02:07:48.762]  Christy Lee has the war room today.
[02:07:49.322 --> 02:07:50.883]  So, let me do a news blitz.
[02:07:51.083 --> 02:07:53.845]  First, though, let's go to this clip from Gavin Newsom.
[02:07:54.425 --> 02:08:02.550]  There is just so much ridiculousness and hilarity in Gavin Newsom announcing that he is moving to truth social.
[02:08:04.363 --> 02:08:08.866]  Hey everybody, it's Governor Gavin Newsom, and I know we're all on this platform in search for the truth.
[02:08:09.446 --> 02:08:17.532]  But the truth is, I've not been able to find a simple explanation for the fact that we have a red state murder problem.
[02:08:17.652 --> 02:08:22.435]  Eight of the top ten states with the highest murder rates happen to be red states.
[02:08:22.815 --> 02:08:23.816]  So the question is simple.
[02:08:24.396 --> 02:08:29.700]  What are the laws and policies in those states that are leading to such carnage?
[02:08:31.038 --> 02:08:31.399]  Wow.
[02:08:31.800 --> 02:08:35.327]  So, okay, he's moving to Truth Social to troll Republicans.
[02:08:35.808 --> 02:08:36.990]  I mean, can you believe?
[02:08:37.010 --> 02:08:41.018]  So this is the new Democrat talking point.
[02:08:42.148 --> 02:08:46.209]  Because it can't be denied that all the crime happens in Democrat-run cities.
[02:08:46.489 --> 02:08:47.470]  I'd love to see the map.
[02:08:48.050 --> 02:08:53.192]  And we've already done it, because AOC started this debate with people on Twitter, and she got horrifically embarrassed.
[02:08:53.672 --> 02:08:55.652]  Because it was actually AOC that started this talking point.
[02:08:55.692 --> 02:08:58.753]  She said, she said, well, you know, the most dangerous states are the red states.
[02:08:59.173 --> 02:09:15.523]   And then everybody put up the maps of the red states, and they showed demographically, or rather politically, Which counties are red versus blue next to the maps of where all the crime happens, and of course all the crime happens in Democrat-run cities.
[02:09:15.683 --> 02:09:16.484]  Everybody knows that!
[02:09:17.404 --> 02:09:22.027]  Everybody knows Democrat-run cities top crime rates in the country.
[02:09:22.207 --> 02:09:23.308]  It's not a secret, everybody knows it.
[02:09:23.328 --> 02:09:30.392]  So now their new trope, their new propaganda, their new lie is, oh, violence is happening in red states.
[02:09:31.440 --> 02:09:33.341]  Okay, let's see those maps of the violence.
[02:09:33.381 --> 02:09:36.103]  Let's see what those red state violent maps look like.
[02:09:36.223 --> 02:09:36.844]  Let's go ahead and do it.
[02:09:37.244 --> 02:09:37.404]  Yeah.
[02:09:38.004 --> 02:09:43.448]  It's red states and then blue areas where all the crime is.
[02:09:45.309 --> 02:09:49.552]  These Democrats, they will never stop lying.
[02:09:49.832 --> 02:09:52.454]  They are just liars through and through.
[02:09:53.095 --> 02:09:53.935]  It's in their blood.
[02:09:54.716 --> 02:09:58.078]  Speaking of maps, you guys can dot cam this for me or put it on the screen.
[02:09:58.198 --> 02:09:59.319]  Andrew Yang shared this.
[02:10:01.053 --> 02:10:03.554]  And, uh, I really don't even care about the commentary.
[02:10:03.574 --> 02:10:04.715]  The map is more important to me.
[02:10:05.715 --> 02:10:06.495]  What do you notice?
[02:10:06.895 --> 02:10:08.796]  So, it's the same as usual.
[02:10:08.976 --> 02:10:10.337]  Blue represents Democrats.
[02:10:10.437 --> 02:10:12.458]  Red represents Republicans.
[02:10:12.998 --> 02:10:14.939]  What do you notice about these maps?
[02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:20.301]  And the darker red it is, the more Republicans there are.
[02:10:20.761 --> 02:10:24.623]  So, if there's... So, for example, here in 1992, you notice there's not much color on the map.
[02:10:26.064 --> 02:10:28.686]  Because the country was mostly neutral.
[02:10:29.447 --> 02:10:38.054]  And so you had some strong Republican areas, some strong Democrat areas, but most of the country you see here is either not colored at all, or very light red, or very light blue.
[02:10:39.215 --> 02:10:44.960]  Because Americans were a lot more neutral then, and, you know, people might vote Democrat or Republican.
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:45.761]  But now look at 2016.
[02:10:46.662 --> 02:10:47.082]  Look at that.
[02:10:47.202 --> 02:10:47.642]  Look at that.
[02:10:48.423 --> 02:10:50.505]  Almost the entire country is red.
[02:10:54.417 --> 02:10:59.959]  So how do Democrats keep winning elections when everybody keeps voting and moving to the Republican Party?
[02:11:01.199 --> 02:11:02.399]  Isn't that odd?
[02:11:04.420 --> 02:11:05.440]  Isn't that strange?
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:08.621]  And then the Democrats come out and argue that, oh, it's not fair.
[02:11:09.061 --> 02:11:12.122]  We win the popular vote, which I doubt they even do that legitimately.
[02:11:12.602 --> 02:11:14.023]  Or they say, oh, it's not fair.
[02:11:15.263 --> 02:11:17.644]  We need to rewrite the electoral system.
[02:11:20.168 --> 02:11:23.729]  Because, you know, we're the more popular party.
[02:11:23.829 --> 02:11:24.129]  Really?
[02:11:24.249 --> 02:11:24.570]  Are you?
[02:11:25.150 --> 02:11:28.171]  Because every other map would indicate you're not.
[02:11:29.271 --> 02:11:36.934]  You're popular in the ten most population-dense areas because you've driven people into poverty and desolation and then you promised them free stuff.
[02:11:37.674 --> 02:11:38.874]  That's where you're popular.
[02:11:39.395 --> 02:11:40.215]  Nowhere else.
[02:11:41.715 --> 02:11:43.156]  Nowhere else are you popular.
[02:11:44.156 --> 02:11:48.978]  So it's just another example of that in these maps shared by Andrew Yang here.
[02:11:51.408 --> 02:11:59.171]  So, Democrats basically control the fate of the entire country, and in many ways the fate of the world, but that's changing, as I've explained why earlier.
[02:12:00.491 --> 02:12:04.253]  They control the fate of the country with basically ten major U.S.
[02:12:04.293 --> 02:12:05.993]  cities and population-dense areas.
[02:12:06.033 --> 02:12:14.417]  The Democrats are able to control the entire country politically with ten major population-dense areas, which also are some of the most violent cities in the world as well.
[02:12:15.417 --> 02:12:20.379]  But so they see that that is waning, and so now they're going with their fully rigged election systems.
[02:12:21.533 --> 02:12:23.715]  With mail-in ballots and ballot drop boxes.
[02:12:25.497 --> 02:12:29.541]  Yeah, there's the most dangerous cities in the world there in the country on the screen.
[02:12:29.581 --> 02:12:31.783]  They're all run by Democrats, by the way.
[02:12:32.304 --> 02:12:35.627]  All run by Democrats and have been for 50 plus years, by the way.
[02:12:36.027 --> 02:12:38.590]  But then now they say, oh, red states are the ones with the violence problem.
[02:12:38.610 --> 02:12:40.452]  Give us a break, you lying crooks.
[02:12:42.469 --> 02:12:43.190]  Here we go again.
[02:12:43.850 --> 02:12:50.676]  Mail-in votes catapult radical Karen Bass ahead of primary challenger with eight-point swing in L.A.
[02:12:50.736 --> 02:12:51.516]  mayoral race.
[02:12:51.737 --> 02:13:02.145]  But, oh, so the person Bass was running against, Rick Caruso, is looking like he's going to win, win, win, and then, bing!
[02:13:02.545 --> 02:13:10.872]  Magically, all these ballots pour in and put the Democrat ahead with just the right amount of votes at the perfect time right before the buzzer.
[02:13:11.132 --> 02:13:11.693]  But guess what?
[02:13:12.927 --> 02:13:16.470]  Even though, I think this election happened ten days ago, I want to say?
[02:13:17.391 --> 02:13:26.698]  Even though this election happened ten days ago, and now all of a sudden the Democrat pulls ahead, they're saying that they're not even going to have the final results for another two weeks?
[02:13:27.939 --> 02:13:32.303]  Yeah, I mean, they'll dig up any Democrat vote they can find for months afterwards, or years even.
[02:13:33.084 --> 02:13:36.927]  They'll claim Hillary Clinton won in 2016, they just found a million votes for her in a dumpster.
[02:13:39.076 --> 02:13:45.079]  WikiLeaks Julian Assange will face espionage charges in the United States after extradition order signed by UK.
[02:13:46.519 --> 02:13:49.140]  So, is Julian Assange coming here now?
[02:13:49.260 --> 02:13:50.801]  Is he gonna have his day in court?
[02:13:51.962 --> 02:13:55.203]  Of course, I wouldn't expect Biden to pardon him, but Julian Assange deserves a pardon.
[02:13:55.243 --> 02:13:56.584]  Trump really dropped the ball on that.
[02:13:57.464 --> 02:13:58.825]  Really dropped the ball with that.
[02:14:00.505 --> 02:14:01.506]  Poor Julian Assange.
[02:14:03.280 --> 02:14:10.506]  A hero, a truth teller, a maverick, and of course, the deep state, the globalists have destroyed his life.
[02:14:11.587 --> 02:14:12.948]  Because he exposed their crimes.
[02:14:13.068 --> 02:14:17.092]  And that's what you get when you expose the crimes of the political class.
[02:14:17.392 --> 02:14:18.914]  You become a political prisoner.
[02:14:19.094 --> 02:14:20.275]  I know all about that, folks.
[02:14:21.736 --> 02:14:22.817]  Yes, indeed.
[02:14:23.277 --> 02:14:25.399]  Sotomayor praises Clarence Thomas.
[02:14:25.439 --> 02:14:27.921]  He is a man who cares deeply about the court as an institution.
[02:14:27.981 --> 02:14:28.342]  Wow!
[02:14:28.442 --> 02:14:30.624]  Even the far-left Sotomayor is standing up for Clarence Thomas.
[02:14:31.527 --> 02:14:33.809]  Despite all the Democrat attacks and lies against him today.
[02:14:36.091 --> 02:14:41.916]  And the Supreme Court is expected to reverse the Miranda rights requirements.
[02:14:43.077 --> 02:14:46.640]  Expected reversal of Miranda requires states to step up on policing.
[02:14:46.660 --> 02:14:51.484]  So apparently the Supreme Court is about to get rid of the reading of the Miranda rights when you get arrested.
[02:14:51.964 --> 02:14:54.026]  That is an interesting one, isn't it?
[02:14:55.384 --> 02:14:59.887]  Twitter employees freak out on Elon Musk after he says all lives matter.
[02:15:00.348 --> 02:15:01.469]  Well, why would that freak you out?
[02:15:01.549 --> 02:15:03.410]  Well, because you're a liberal nitwit.
[02:15:03.810 --> 02:15:05.231]  Because you're a liberal psycho.
[02:15:05.932 --> 02:15:07.873]  So that's the kind of stuff that freaks you out.
[02:15:09.213 --> 02:15:11.014]  We've got some vaccine news here.
[02:15:11.634 --> 02:15:14.294]  FDA authorizes COVID jab for kids five years and under.
[02:15:14.334 --> 02:15:15.515]  Yeah, I mean, they can't kill enough.
[02:15:15.555 --> 02:15:19.276]  I mean, you kill one five-year-old, you killed a whole bloodline, a whole lineage.
[02:15:19.816 --> 02:15:22.876]  Could be thousands of people that could have come human lives from that person.
[02:15:22.896 --> 02:15:23.557]  So gotta get them young.
[02:15:23.917 --> 02:15:26.297]  CDC issues new emergency guidance on monkeypox.
[02:15:26.877 --> 02:15:31.138]  Yes, but also they're gonna change the name of monkeypox because they say that's racist somehow.
[02:15:32.519 --> 02:15:32.899]  Interesting.
[02:15:33.837 --> 02:15:40.738]  GOP election worker arrested for not wearing face mask during training session at former TCF center where face masks are not mandatory.
[02:15:40.758 --> 02:15:45.139]  Well, yeah, anything to get the Republicans, anything to get the American patriots out from pool watching.
[02:15:45.219 --> 02:15:46.300]  They got to steal these elections.
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:48.160]  They can't have Republicans in there watching them steal them.
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:48.540]  Come on.
[02:15:49.580 --> 02:15:55.122]  Trudeau suspends vaccine restrictions for Canada air and train travel.
[02:15:57.182 --> 02:15:57.302]  Oh.
[02:15:59.663 --> 02:16:00.863]  Oh, they'll never be mandatory.
[02:16:00.883 --> 02:16:01.643]  And then they mandated them.
[02:16:02.924 --> 02:16:12.269]  Inmate planned to strangle Ghislaine Maxwell in her sleep at Brooklyn Federal Jail, according to the lawyer, and they're trying to figure out who paid this inmate.
[02:16:12.689 --> 02:16:15.271]  So that's an interesting development, but again, the media not covering it.
[02:16:15.311 --> 02:16:16.011]  They're covering it up.
[02:16:17.072 --> 02:16:22.515]  They don't want you to know about Bill Clinton and everybody else who was using Jeffrey Epstein's sex slaves.
[02:16:23.395 --> 02:16:24.756]  They don't want you to know about that.
[02:16:25.905 --> 02:16:28.846]  Flying has been an absolute bear if you've been trying to fly lately.
[02:16:28.886 --> 02:16:31.646]  Problems soar for airlines despite pandemic recovery.
[02:16:32.146 --> 02:16:35.487]  Airline staff shortages threaten to ruin millions of summer holidays.
[02:16:35.927 --> 02:16:39.767]  Delta pilots say they've been flying record amount of overtime amid flight cancellations.
[02:16:39.827 --> 02:16:44.428]  Yeah, it's just more signs of a collapsing country, a collapsing civilization.
[02:16:44.488 --> 02:16:45.228]  Kind of like this.
[02:16:47.009 --> 02:16:52.650]  Kids served floor sealant instead of milk at Alaska school program.
[02:16:52.930 --> 02:16:54.870]  Floor sealant instead of milk.
[02:16:58.982 --> 02:17:01.684]  How does that happen?
[02:17:03.205 --> 02:17:03.845]  That's interesting.
[02:17:04.326 --> 02:17:10.590]  You know, I don't really do celebrity pop culture stuff, but it's just interesting, these people lie about anything.
[02:17:12.011 --> 02:17:18.676]  Kim Kardashian did not damage Marilyn Monroe's dress, according to Ripley's, this is a CNN story.
[02:17:18.796 --> 02:17:26.201]  Folks, again, I don't really care about Kim Kardashian, I really don't even care about Marilyn Monroe's dress, but like, we've seen the images, okay?
[02:17:27.549 --> 02:17:35.356]  Uh, yeah, Kim Kardashian's fake plastic body busted out the seams of Marilyn Monroe's dress.
[02:17:35.516 --> 02:17:37.717]  I mean, the images are all over the internet.
[02:17:37.758 --> 02:17:41.461]  She busted out the seams because of her fake plastic butt and breasts.
[02:17:42.341 --> 02:17:44.383]  And then CNN says, no, she didn't do it.
[02:17:44.463 --> 02:17:46.445]  Why are they protecting Kim Kardashian like this?
[02:17:47.365 --> 02:17:48.166]  It's really weird.
[02:17:48.987 --> 02:17:52.389]  It's like, here's the images, the dress ripped, and they say, nope, it didn't rip, didn't happen.
[02:17:53.530 --> 02:17:55.212]  I really don't understand these people at all.
[02:17:56.621 --> 02:17:59.164]  Belief in God in U.S.
[02:17:59.204 --> 02:18:00.025]  drops to 81%.
[02:18:00.546 --> 02:18:01.287]  A new low.
[02:18:01.547 --> 02:18:03.870]  There is your problem, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:18:04.250 --> 02:18:04.811]  Right there.
[02:18:04.951 --> 02:18:05.912]  And who's doing this?
[02:18:06.173 --> 02:18:06.693]  The left.
[02:18:06.893 --> 02:18:07.314]  Liberals.
[02:18:07.494 --> 02:18:10.217]  They hate God because they are of the devil.
[02:18:10.618 --> 02:18:12.100]  All right, my time is up here.
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:14.663]  Jay Dyer now takes over.
[02:18:15.390 --> 02:18:16.471]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:18:16.491 --> 02:18:19.272]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jay's Analysis.
[02:18:20.073 --> 02:18:33.709]   And one of the topics that we've not yet covered in my fourth hour, although we have covered extensively MKUltra and the MKUltra projects, We haven't gone into any of the theories to where it might have been deployed, especially domestically in the U.S.
[02:18:33.749 --> 02:18:40.212]  So today we're going to look at a theory, which I think is plausible, at least in some of the cases of the famous serial killers.
[02:18:40.272 --> 02:18:44.814]  Now, true crime has, for whatever reason, exploded all over the Internet.
[02:18:44.834 --> 02:18:47.235]  The hottest podcast on YouTube, millions of views.
[02:18:48.132 --> 02:19:09.907]  Are true crime things, and typically I know that Alex Importers doesn't focus on true crime, but it does relate to elite criminality because true crime could be a window into the pathology, the modus operandi of psychopaths and mad scientists who kind of operate like Jeffrey Dahmer, or you know, some of these people.
[02:19:10.588 --> 02:19:20.977]   They kind of have their own, maybe more high IQ, wealthier way to approach the issues of Human experimentation, human sacrifice perhaps even.
[02:19:20.997 --> 02:19:32.103]  So we're going to look at some of the famous cases of the serial killers and look at some of the odd anomalies that pop up and some of the patterns that are not usually talked about in the mainstream.
[02:19:32.947 --> 02:19:52.818]  Everybody knows that the sort of mainstream profile of a serial killer is the, oh, he's a nerdy white dude who's, you know, 35 years old, and he lives at home, and he's an incel, and he doesn't have any friends, and he is mad at his mom, and he's gotta fight back against the system by going after prostitutes.
[02:19:52.878 --> 02:19:57.521]  And so he has a type, and he always follows a pattern of a certain type of this and that.
[02:19:57.921 --> 02:19:59.061]  But is that really the case?
[02:19:59.141 --> 02:20:09.829]   Is that The reality of what serial killers are, is there an aspect of media manipulation to create the idea of there being serial killers everywhere?
[02:20:10.210 --> 02:20:13.092]  Especially back in the time period of the 70s and the 80s, right?
[02:20:13.172 --> 02:20:18.516]  Right when we're getting into that, right around the same time of when the satanic panic emerges.
[02:20:18.616 --> 02:20:26.623]  And some of the serial killers actually did sort of figure into the satanic panic, particularly with Geraldo's famous series on it.
[02:20:27.503 --> 02:20:32.446]  That helped spark that fear in the case of, in Geraldo's case, Bobby Berdella.
[02:20:33.026 --> 02:20:36.648]  Now, let's consider, is there such a thing?
[02:20:36.868 --> 02:20:44.652]  Is there a reality to the possibility of programs, assassin programs, government programs that could be similar to serial killers?
[02:20:44.852 --> 02:20:46.773]  Is there anything like any evidence that we have of that?
[02:20:46.793 --> 02:20:51.115]  Well, actually, there are quite a few evidence, pieces of evidence to prove this.
[02:20:51.796 --> 02:20:54.997]  The first of which is a Canadian journalist all the way back in 2002.
[02:20:56.436 --> 02:20:58.195]  Uh, named Doug Saunders and writing for.
[02:20:59.006 --> 02:21:15.138]  The Globe and Mail, writing for mainstream Canadian publications, he figured out, hey, wait a minute, there's actually a pattern to a lot of serial killers where they seem to have had some degree of serious military training, perhaps even assassin training, and that's something that not many people have talked about.
[02:21:15.158 --> 02:21:21.242]  Now, I'm not trying to knock everybody in the military, so don't misunderstand me here, but this is something that, again, people have begun to notice.
[02:21:21.262 --> 02:21:38.087]   So there's the Doug Saunders 2002 piece, where he noticed that, and right around that same time, Actually, before that, the first person to really key into this was the famous writer Maury Terry, who was an investigator into the Son of Sam case.
[02:21:38.127 --> 02:21:40.889]  He was known as kind of the expert on the Son of Sam.
[02:21:41.970 --> 02:21:54.561]  And he had always thought positive, especially after, you know, the case of Berkowitz had basically been settled, that there were other accomplices and then it connected to a larger occult and satanic network.
[02:21:55.416 --> 02:22:00.340]  And if you don't know, of course, some months back, Netflix did a whole series, Sons of Sam.
[02:22:01.020 --> 02:22:03.902]  And the idea was, oh, what are we really going to see here?
[02:22:04.002 --> 02:22:06.624]  I, when I was watching this, I expected, oh, here's another whitewash.
[02:22:06.644 --> 02:22:10.787]  They're going to, we're going to whitewash this whole thing and we have to say, oh, it's not really a conspiracy.
[02:22:10.827 --> 02:22:19.894]  But ironically, even though there was a couple episodes in there out of the five or so that they put out, that kind of attempted to make Maury Terry look bad.
[02:22:20.334 --> 02:22:24.177]  In the end, overall, it kind of vindicated Maury Terry's research.
[02:22:24.986 --> 02:22:39.311]  And if you don't know, he put out the famous book, Ultimate Evil, alleging again, higher level cults, cults that connected Manson and Berkowitz and people in the UK, the Process Church, the Process Magazine were key connects for those two figures.
[02:22:40.626 --> 02:22:43.808]  And even in the Process Church, we have a connection to the figure of Jimmy Savile.
[02:22:43.828 --> 02:22:49.411]  Savile wrote and did interviews and articles for the Process Magazine in the UK.
[02:22:49.451 --> 02:22:58.596]  Now, I think this is very telling because we know that Savile connects to a couple serial killers as well that happened to just be his friends, right?
[02:22:58.616 --> 02:23:00.877]  Peter Sutcliffe and the Moore killers.
[02:23:01.657 --> 02:23:07.461]  So, odd companions there for people that are operating at such a high level.
[02:23:07.501 --> 02:23:07.881]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:23:07.901 --> 02:23:10.002]  We're going to get back into the serial killers on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:10.635 --> 02:23:11.555]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:11.575 --> 02:23:13.676]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jayson Alice's.
[02:23:13.696 --> 02:23:16.437]  We're talking about true crime and serial killers.
[02:23:16.477 --> 02:23:20.378]  And what does this have to do with elite psychopathy, the Great Reset?
[02:23:20.398 --> 02:23:32.041]  Well, we're going to see that the attitude of a lot of these people, the higher level connections that they have, might suggest that much more is going on than the profile of the lone nut serial killer, the obsessive incel.
[02:23:34.491 --> 02:23:41.573]  Back in 1975, a report came out in European news, and this was unfortunately something that appeared to leak.
[02:23:42.421 --> 02:23:52.729]  And it was about the Navy and Dr. Thomas Nehrut, who was in charge of a program in the Navy to profile and train serial killers and to use them as assassins.
[02:23:52.809 --> 02:23:53.870]  And you can find this.
[02:23:53.970 --> 02:23:54.511]  It came out.
[02:23:54.551 --> 02:23:59.995]  It was Navy denies that it trains assassins.
[02:24:00.035 --> 02:24:02.737]  But then, of course, it admits in the article that, oh, actually, they do.
[02:24:03.157 --> 02:24:21.017]   So so don't be fooled by the headline there, because there was more to that and some really other interesting cases that are lesser known that Our similar to this would be the case of the Italian servants of the Satanic sect that the Guardian reported on.
[02:24:22.277 --> 02:24:24.039]  The police raided them back in the 90s.
[02:24:24.059 --> 02:24:29.723]  You can find in the Irish Times articles like this where they were raided.
[02:24:29.743 --> 02:24:39.629]   This is a very famous case because it came out in the Guardian and it turns out that this sect had tie-ins to the Dutro affair, which is one of the most
[02:24:39.629 --> 02:24:43.009]   famous Belgian cases where you had women being
[02:24:43.009 --> 02:24:49.399]   persecuted and put into dungeons and whatnot and he seemed to be the procurer and in that case it went up to the
[02:24:49.399 --> 02:24:52.649]   highest levels of the Belgian government included Roman Catholic clergy,
[02:24:52.649 --> 02:24:56.588]   people from NATO. It was it was a very scandalous case. A million people
[02:24:56.588 --> 02:25:02.908]   marched in the streets over this. Now what is there anything else that might suggest this?
[02:25:03.019 --> 02:25:28.481]   Well, it turns out in the Phoenix Program, which was again a book that I've lectured on and covered recently from Douglas Valentine, within the first hundred pages he actually goes into some of the specifics, I think on page 61, of what the Phoenix Program involved in Vietnam and it literally involved the training of Navy SEALs and people from other units and attachments.
[02:25:28.521 --> 02:25:32.584]  I'm not trying to go after just Navy SEALs or say that everybody in Vietnam is bad.
[02:25:32.604 --> 02:25:43.911]  What they really tried to do is pick out and profile, it appears, the most psychopathic and the most, the people most oriented towards being a potential serial killer.
[02:25:44.712 --> 02:25:59.953]   And so they would indoctrinate them and teach them, for example, the local occult beliefs, in this case, And Valentine says that from the different groups that were recruited, some of the SEAL comrades and CTs were taught the secrets of Psywar.
[02:26:00.693 --> 02:26:07.218]  This meant exploring and exploiting superstitions, myths, and the religious beliefs of the indigenous Vietnamese.
[02:26:07.778 --> 02:26:13.622]  Our technique, one technique, was based on the Buddhist belief that a person cannot enter heaven if his liver is intact.
[02:26:14.442 --> 02:26:19.822]   And so various members of this program, especially those near the Ho Chi Minh Trail, would sneak
[02:26:19.822 --> 02:26:25.402]   into the VCI's hooch at night, crush the man's larynx, and then use a dagger to remove his
[02:26:25.402 --> 02:26:26.502]  liver.
[02:26:26.502 --> 02:26:30.822]   Some of these individuals would also devour the enemy's organs.
[02:26:30.822 --> 02:26:36.422]   And it goes on to talk about some of the symbolism they would do when they would dismember the
[02:26:36.422 --> 02:26:37.422]  Viet Cong.
[02:26:37.422 --> 02:26:43.182]   They would put it into a kind of a cult symbol, again, reminiscent of smearing the blood,
[02:26:43.182 --> 02:26:48.822]   putting an all-seeing eye, because the Vietnamese Buddhists had a reverence for the third eye,
[02:26:48.822 --> 02:26:49.822]  the all-seeing eye.
[02:26:49.822 --> 02:26:55.742]   And so they would utilize this as a psi-war technique, according to Valentine.
[02:26:55.742 --> 02:27:02.061]   And this mutilation then had a powerful psychological effect on the population of the Viet Cong.
[02:27:02.754 --> 02:27:12.481]  Now, I'm not pro-communist, so I'm not citing this as some, you know, way to say, oh, America was, you know, totally evil, or we're all the bad guys.
[02:27:12.521 --> 02:27:13.202]  I'm not saying that.
[02:27:13.222 --> 02:27:24.630]  I'm just pointing out that this is apparently a real technique that was used in training these profiled potential and actual serial killers in the case of Vietnam.
[02:27:24.690 --> 02:27:40.523]   In fact, it even goes on to say that this eye of God symbolism assumed its mysterious counter-espionage qualities Through the myth of the Eternal Cycle, the Eye of God was a symbol of the Cao Dai sect, and it included saints like Confucius, Buddha, Joan of Arc, and others.
[02:27:40.542 --> 02:27:46.862]   So there was this weird all-seeing eye sect that was popular in Vietnam.
[02:27:46.862 --> 02:27:52.702]   And when the agents of the Phoenix program would do these techniques, they were able
[02:27:52.702 --> 02:27:59.182]   to utilize the cannibalism, the dismemberment, smearing the blood and whatnot, because it
[02:27:59.182 --> 02:28:02.983]   actually had this tremendous effect on the indigenous population.
[02:28:02.983 --> 02:28:10.182]   Now, if the theory is true or even plausible or even possibly true that Dave McGowan puts
[02:28:10.182 --> 02:28:15.382]   forward in his book, Program to Kill, he covers the possibility that the Phoenix program could
[02:28:15.382 --> 02:28:19.342]   have been something bigger than that and could have been utilized when these people came
[02:28:19.342 --> 02:28:22.342]  back to run similar types of operations.
[02:28:22.368 --> 02:28:31.814]  And remember, we've covered in multiple books on the history of the Vietnam War that the Vietnam War appears to have been kind of intentionally lost because what it did was help to erode U.S.
[02:28:31.874 --> 02:28:32.495]  morale.
[02:28:32.555 --> 02:28:34.796]  It helped to make America look like a bad guy.
[02:28:35.277 --> 02:28:47.185]   It was a never-ending sort of drug problem, sort of a never-ending cycle of Drugs being shipped in and out from that region to the U.S.
[02:28:47.225 --> 02:28:49.209]  and so there's different angles and levels to it.
[02:28:49.229 --> 02:28:53.218]  It was the first war where they really rolled out AI, drone warfare.
[02:28:54.207 --> 02:28:56.870]  And again, it's not to say that the Viet Cong were good guys.
[02:28:56.910 --> 02:28:58.271]  I don't think there's a good guy, bad guy here.
[02:28:58.731 --> 02:29:09.982]  Rather, that our focus is on the R&D done in Vietnam and how that could have then been used in the future for future Psywar campaigns and programs, especially domestically.
[02:29:10.543 --> 02:29:12.464]  So what about serial killers?
[02:29:12.564 --> 02:29:13.786]  Why is it, for example?
[02:29:14.406 --> 02:29:18.630]  That we seem to see this explosion of serial killers in the 70s and 80s.
[02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:19.731]  That was like their heyday.
[02:29:20.031 --> 02:29:23.634]  And yes, a couple guys up into the 90s, BTK, right?
[02:29:23.654 --> 02:29:25.255]  A couple people in the 90s and 2000s.
[02:29:26.596 --> 02:29:30.920]  Israel Keys is another one of more recent note.
[02:29:31.020 --> 02:29:34.222]  And yes, there have been some serial killers in the last couple decades.
[02:29:34.643 --> 02:29:43.310]  But they seem to really have their attention, their media focus and explosion and exposure during those time periods.
[02:29:44.033 --> 02:29:51.695]  And particularly in many, many cases, we have people in the Vietnam War who end up being serial killers.
[02:29:51.735 --> 02:29:58.576]  I mean, there's a striking number, I'm going to list them here in a minute, I've got them all listed, of how many of them ended up in Vietnam.
[02:29:58.616 --> 02:30:03.137]  Now, do we know if they were all, you know, in the Phoenix program?
[02:30:03.517 --> 02:30:04.757]  No, I don't know that.
[02:30:05.177 --> 02:30:13.219]  But what we're going to look at, especially with the Israel character there, is that many of these people are explicitly into Satanism, especially that guy.
[02:30:14.338 --> 02:30:19.520]  Especially Berkowitz, especially Richard Ramirez, okay?
[02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:21.641]  And a lot of people don't know this about Dahmer either.
[02:30:21.661 --> 02:30:32.425]  And these are going to be interesting notes to make because you don't usually hear this in the media, but they don't talk about the real patterns of a serial killer, the real profile.
[02:30:32.465 --> 02:30:41.908]  There's this public kind of FBI profile that, you know, again, oh, it's just the, you know, the mainline weird loner.
[02:30:42.739 --> 02:30:44.140]  But actually, that's not the case.
[02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:46.081]  In fact, a lot of them end up having accomplices.
[02:30:46.101 --> 02:30:47.442]  A lot of them are into the occult.
[02:30:47.523 --> 02:30:48.603]  In fact, the majority of them are.
[02:30:49.384 --> 02:31:03.854]  So we're going to look at the real profile, but here is the list of the most notable serial killers, especially of the 70s and 80s, who had military training and or Vietnam training and experience.
[02:31:04.695 --> 02:31:39.587]   The BTK killer, Jeffrey Dahmer, David Berkowitz, Richard Williams, John Muhammad, Gary Ridway, Ridway, Ridgway, excuse me, Ray Norris, Charles Whitman, Leonard Lake, Arthur Shawcross, Charles Ng, Anthony Soul, Dean Corl, Dennis Nilsen, Gary Heidnik, Robert Lee Yates, Richard Allen Davis, Timothy McVeigh, Randy Kraft, and I imagine we could keep going on and on, especially if we begin to factor in not just the lone serial killers, but the serial killers who ran cults, like the
[02:31:40.328 --> 02:31:53.394]  The Jim Jones types, I don't recall if Jim Jones was in any kind of military association, but he did have CIA connections in regard to what went down in the Jonestown Massacre.
[02:31:53.414 --> 02:32:07.934]   And in fact, you can find on Bandai Video, Harrison over at American Journal did a really in-depth dive, deep dive into the deep state connections to To Jonestown, so I highly recommend that if you haven't seen that.
[02:32:07.994 --> 02:32:20.944]  But remember, there is the Office of Naval Intelligence program to use killers and their mind, behavioral modification for their mind control programs under Dr. Thomas Nerich, who then said, no, that doesn't exist, even though it does.
[02:32:21.565 --> 02:32:25.828]  So he admits it at a NATO conference in Naples, Italy and Oslo.
[02:32:25.848 --> 02:32:27.189]  That's the article I mentioned earlier.
[02:32:28.473 --> 02:32:37.323]  And there's McVeigh, for example, who clearly appears to have been a sheep dip character who was pinned with the OKC incident.
[02:32:39.269 --> 02:33:01.466]  But there's also the case, too, that we uncovered recently, if you listen to my talks on MKUltra, where John Marks had an essay back in the 80s where he had discovered that John Gittinger, the origin of the personality profile diagram, Gittinger himself had also been involved in a CIA program to recruit sickos, pedos, and psychos.
[02:33:01.806 --> 02:33:02.687]  So keep that in mind.
[02:33:03.348 --> 02:33:04.529]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:04.549 --> 02:33:06.070]  This is Jay Dyer, Jay's Analysis.
[02:33:06.090 --> 02:33:09.173]  You can find my work on YouTube as well as at my website.
[02:33:09.673 --> 02:33:12.775]  I'm almost to 100,000 if you want to subscribe over my YouTube channel.
[02:33:12.795 --> 02:33:15.417]  Help me get to 100,000 if you like what you hear today.
[02:33:15.437 --> 02:33:18.600]  I do all kinds of podcasts like this, talks, lectures.
[02:33:18.640 --> 02:33:25.725]  There's almost a thousand talks and lectures and most of them are not dated so you can always go back and watch the movie reviews.
[02:33:25.765 --> 02:33:35.232]   You can watch the lectures on philosophy and geopolitics, religion, debates, and even this crazy true crime stuff like The serial killer conspiracy.
[02:33:35.252 --> 02:33:36.213]  Is there something to this?
[02:33:36.273 --> 02:33:36.954]  Is it possible?
[02:33:36.994 --> 02:33:39.636]  Well, what are the precedents for this?
[02:33:39.896 --> 02:33:41.617]  We saw the Phoenix program in Vietnam.
[02:33:41.657 --> 02:33:43.639]  We've seen some of the other programs mentioned.
[02:33:43.679 --> 02:33:53.538]   I mentioned Dr. John Gittinger and his recruitment of hobos, dishwashers, and pervs and psychopaths to be part of a CIA
[02:33:53.538 --> 02:33:56.058]   program that was part of MKUltra that we don't know a whole lot about,
[02:33:56.058 --> 02:34:00.378]   but we do know that there was a program where he was studying them and their proclivities
[02:34:00.378 --> 02:34:07.018]   and how to manipulate and control people on the basis of their weaknesses and their obsessions
[02:34:07.018 --> 02:34:09.418]  and their sicknesses, right?
[02:34:09.418 --> 02:34:10.259]  This kind of stuff.
[02:34:10.259 --> 02:34:15.398]   Now, what about other cases where you've heard me mention there might be precedent for this as well.
[02:34:15.398 --> 02:34:18.158]  Well, what about Murder, Inc?
[02:34:17.854 --> 02:34:29.621]  Does anybody remember that the Mafia at one time had a gigantic guild of, at one point, a couple hundred, maybe 300 killers that they could call upon at any time to be a contract killing situation?
[02:34:29.761 --> 02:34:32.122]  I mean, it's a famous thing known as Murder, Inc.
[02:34:32.182 --> 02:34:36.885]  And by the way, some of these people didn't just work with organized crime, as we've covered in the past.
[02:34:36.965 --> 02:34:38.926]  Many cases were U.S.
[02:34:38.966 --> 02:34:46.945]   intelligence, foreign intelligence, where they would actually contract Killings out to organize crime so that it didn't get back to...
[02:34:48.138 --> 02:34:48.639]  The U.S.
[02:34:48.699 --> 02:34:52.282]  or the intelligence agencies or the government who wanted the assassination done.
[02:34:52.822 --> 02:35:03.731]  So in other words, if we were looking for motives or means or the purposes for the usage of like a cult, one of those would be something like to have somebody taken care of, right?
[02:35:03.791 --> 02:35:11.657]  So rather than it being a hit that the CIA or something does, well, it ends up, oh, it's that was just some crazy cult leader.
[02:35:11.697 --> 02:35:16.001]  That was just some crazy guy, you know, lone nut out there.
[02:35:17.091 --> 02:35:20.773]  As part of some satanic cult, when in fact there was another purpose for that.
[02:35:20.813 --> 02:35:30.440]  And in fact, more recently, authors famous, well, you've probably seen Tom O'Neill on Sam Tripoli's podcast or over on Joe Rogan's podcast.
[02:35:30.460 --> 02:35:42.107]  You know, he put out a book recently about Manson, you know, chaos and Manson in the 60s and the connections that have eventually emerged about the CIA's connections to Manson.
[02:35:42.924 --> 02:35:56.895]  And again, that's relevant because of the high-level connections that are emerging still in regard to Berkowitz via the Process Church, via the Hollywood elite that Manson oddly seemed to be running around, the circles he was running with.
[02:35:58.116 --> 02:36:01.899]  And also people like a guy named Tico, T-E-K-O.
[02:36:02.682 --> 02:36:09.728]  Who was a CIA slash OSS assassin who was intimately connected to a lot of the Hollywood crowds.
[02:36:09.808 --> 02:36:11.790]  And so this also connects to drug drug running.
[02:36:12.171 --> 02:36:19.157]  This is an angle that a lot of people don't know about or talk about in regard to Manson that is just more more recently become clear.
[02:36:20.363 --> 02:36:27.082]   And so that's made adamantly clear in even the first four chapters of O'Neill's book.
[02:36:27.082 --> 02:36:29.843]   But that was something a lot of people had theorized for a long time.
[02:36:29.843 --> 02:36:35.122]   And again, it vindicates what Maury Terry had been writing about so many decades ago
[02:36:35.122 --> 02:36:38.843]  in his book Ultimate Evil.
[02:36:38.843 --> 02:36:57.762]   So let's think about some of the occult serial killers that you may not know about.
[02:36:45.112 --> 02:36:48.193]  Now, probably everybody has heard, oh, Richard Ramirez, right?
[02:36:48.213 --> 02:36:53.036]  The Night Stalker, you know, he's famously shown with that pentagram on his hand, right?
[02:36:53.056 --> 02:36:54.557]  So, yeah, okay, sure.
[02:36:54.597 --> 02:36:59.059]  In that case, there was one serial killer who was into Satanism and the occult.
[02:36:59.079 --> 02:37:08.824]  Well, most of the really prominent ones have this element in their ethos and their symbology and their voices or whatever is going on.
[02:37:09.724 --> 02:37:13.983]   as a pretty consistent pattern. For example, the Son of Sam we know about,
[02:37:13.983 --> 02:37:22.903]   the family cult, the process church that he was involved in, there was connected to Son of Sam Berkowitz
[02:37:22.903 --> 02:37:29.664]   nearby where they were doing their rituals, the Untermayer Gardens, and a sort of an underground facility where
[02:37:29.664 --> 02:37:35.224]   they had found sacrifice dogs where they've been witchcraft symbols drawn there.
[02:37:35.710 --> 02:37:39.792]  Pretty clearly that comes up in the Sons of Sam documentary, even admitted to be the case.
[02:37:40.752 --> 02:37:47.995]  In the case of Zodiac Killer, again one of the most famous serial killer cases, we have very clear agnostic and satanic imagery and symbolism used.
[02:37:48.035 --> 02:37:54.597]  We have astrological symbolism and perhaps even Krolian symbolism with OTO.
[02:37:54.657 --> 02:37:57.859]  It's kind of debated as to what his symbols meant.
[02:37:59.443 --> 02:38:12.166]  In regard to Jeffrey Dahmer, not many people know this, but Dahmer had actually sketched out a satanic altar that he was going to build when he had finished however many skulls he wanted to kill, right?
[02:38:12.186 --> 02:38:22.389]  So he had actually had this altar sketched out with skulls that line the altar and then they sort of, there's like a blue orb that would hang down and he called it his altar of power.
[02:38:23.469 --> 02:38:35.169]   And I dug up a really old interview, it was an old news piece that I come out right around the time that the Dahmer stuff came out back in the 90s.
[02:38:36.629 --> 02:38:47.734]  And it was just a rare, really obscure thing where he had mentioned that he saw himself as some kind of something like an indigenous high priest or a shaman.
[02:38:48.175 --> 02:38:55.718]  And so he seemed to have this view that if he could eat his victims, there it is, that's his actual sketch there.
[02:38:56.238 --> 02:38:57.078]  Those are the skulls.
[02:38:59.517 --> 02:39:05.160]  That's his power altar, and he seemed to feel like that he could draw esoteric and occult power from this.
[02:39:05.941 --> 02:39:13.565]  In the case of Dahmer, this is odd because a lot of people couldn't find any clear occult connections, at least back in the 90s and the 2000s.
[02:39:13.625 --> 02:39:22.710]  But then, turns out, more recently, people have dug up old archived local news reports right when this happened.
[02:39:23.430 --> 02:39:29.713]  And at least two of the neighbors, in the case of Dahmer, one bloomer dude with a mustache who's out there mowing.
[02:39:30.534 --> 02:39:32.335]  They interview him while he's mowing.
[02:39:32.355 --> 02:39:47.062]  He says, yeah, I walked back in the woods where the Dahmer house was and I found ritual paraphernalia in a ritual setting where they had burned out a circle and they had a dog's head and a crucified dog body.
[02:39:48.241 --> 02:39:55.702]  Other cases, or other situations, Dahmer would do the same thing where he would decapitate and or crucify a squirrel.
[02:39:56.603 --> 02:39:57.943]  Now, again, very odd.
[02:39:57.963 --> 02:39:59.903]  Who has even heard about this, right?
[02:40:00.563 --> 02:40:03.044]  Dahmer's high school prom date, right?
[02:40:03.064 --> 02:40:13.325]  This sort of portly young woman that he took to prom, she said, when I went over there to hang out with him, he wanted to engage in seances, Ouija board, and this kind of stuff.
[02:40:13.366 --> 02:40:15.986]  And she says, I ran out of there because I just got creeped out.
[02:40:17.578 --> 02:40:20.162]  So, nobody ever talks about this with regard to Dahmer.
[02:40:20.322 --> 02:40:42.443]   These are things that don't really pop up very much, and you've heard me mention this before, but a fascinating case with Dahmer as well is that when he was stationed in Germany for his brief military service, He was only about 20 minutes away from where another infamous and even worse serial killer Gary Heidnik was stationed around the same, roughly the same time period.
[02:40:43.303 --> 02:40:46.405]  Oddly that they were stationed right next to each other in Germany.
[02:40:47.025 --> 02:40:48.946]  And this seems to produce these serial killers, right?
[02:40:49.026 --> 02:40:56.889]   I don't know why, but Dahmer was investigated for the German Unsolved female murders as well that had occurred.
[02:40:57.429 --> 02:41:10.971]  And then there was a cable, I don't know how legitimate it is, but there's a cable that's out there on the internet that appears to show a high-level general squashing this information on the part of the German government looking into Dahmer as a possible suspect.
[02:41:11.011 --> 02:41:14.152]  So that's another interesting detail that doesn't come up much.
[02:41:14.392 --> 02:41:19.133]  Also, Dahmer seemed to have a very fascinating obsession with the movie Exorcist III.
[02:41:20.594 --> 02:41:26.438]  Reportedly, he would just sit and rock back and forth in his apartment watching this VHS over and over and over.
[02:41:26.918 --> 02:41:33.583]  And if you don't know, that's of course about the Gemini Killer, a serial killer who is demonically possessed by a demon.
[02:41:34.023 --> 02:41:35.224]  I think he goes by the name Gemini.
[02:41:37.225 --> 02:41:39.387]  Now, you might think that's the only cases.
[02:41:39.427 --> 02:41:39.687]  No, no.
[02:41:39.707 --> 02:41:48.092]  There's actually another 20 or so more serial killers who have satanic and occult connections, which we will look at when we get back from this break.
[02:41:48.273 --> 02:41:48.753]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:41:49.415 --> 02:41:50.555]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:41:50.575 --> 02:42:09.922]  We're looking at the odd connections and suppressed information in regard to serial killers and the possibility that they could have been, in many cases, linked to government projects, to satanic cults, to contract killings, organized crime, things that are not usually talked about in regard to the lone nut.
[02:42:09.962 --> 02:42:18.805]  Now, keep in mind, too, when it comes to assassins, the Sirhan Sirhan or Ali Harvey Oswald, we're often told that they're all they're just lone nuts.
[02:42:19.542 --> 02:42:22.704]  And I think that for most people, that narrative is kind of broken down.
[02:42:22.744 --> 02:42:32.391]  I think most people pretty much kind of doubt that normie old school official narrative when it comes to, you know, leave Harvey Oswald or Sirhan Sirhan.
[02:42:33.314 --> 02:42:36.016]  And now we tend to think, no, there's probably something else going on.
[02:42:36.076 --> 02:42:40.460]  I mean, you just don't have these high-profile cases typically being lone nuts.
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:47.886]  Well, is it really that much of a stretch to think that maybe in the case of some serial killers, at least, it's also not lone nuts.
[02:42:48.466 --> 02:42:54.411]  And so right now we're going through the list of serial killers who have an occult, satanic type of connection.
[02:42:55.812 --> 02:42:57.033]  And we just mentioned Dahmer.
[02:42:57.273 --> 02:43:06.064]   A lot of people don't know this, but in regard to Ted Bundy, and this was a little more speculative, but in the case of Ted Bundy, There were other killers that had been arrested and interviewed.
[02:43:07.305 --> 02:43:13.269]  In one case, Mad Dog McKenna, who appeared to have clearly been an organized crime-connected serial killer.
[02:43:13.289 --> 02:43:23.537]  That was at least one of his claims, that he was a contract killer as well as a satanic cult leader for Santos Traficante, the famous organized crime figure.
[02:43:24.823 --> 02:43:36.731]  In the case of many interviews with him, he claimed that Bundy was actually part of the same network of satanic cults and that they would at times be contracted out to do hits.
[02:43:36.790 --> 02:43:41.090]   Now again, we can't always believe serial killers because many of them, well, most of them,
[02:43:41.090 --> 02:43:46.129]   unless they're completely mind-controlled or whatever, they're narcissistic liars.
[02:43:46.129 --> 02:43:51.729]   So they will oftentimes hype up and they wanna have the highest kill list,
[02:43:51.729 --> 02:43:52.729]  kill numbers or whatever.
[02:43:52.729 --> 02:43:54.329]  So we can't always believe them.
[02:43:54.329 --> 02:43:58.411]   But in some cases, it has turned out where things that they claim for many years
[02:43:58.411 --> 02:43:59.411]  were actually true.
[02:43:59.411 --> 02:44:03.730]   For example, Henry Lee Lucas claimed that he was part of a satanic cult
[02:44:03.730 --> 02:44:08.570]   that had kind of raised him the hand of death cult and he actually talked about places
[02:44:08.570 --> 02:44:12.009]   where you would find bodies and this turned out to be true, right?
[02:44:12.009 --> 02:44:17.570]   If I recall, they connected to the Matamoros cult, which was another big famous case where yes,
[02:44:17.570 --> 02:44:21.810]   there was a satanic cult that was involved in human sacrifice and this connected
[02:44:21.810 --> 02:44:23.689]  to what Lucas talked about.
[02:44:23.689 --> 02:44:26.490]  And there really were bodies where he said there would be.
[02:44:26.490 --> 02:44:37.571]   In the case of John Wayne Gacy, Gacy for many, many years said he had accomplices and that he was not the only guy, you know, luring in people and killing them.
[02:44:38.192 --> 02:44:49.193]  And it has turned out that even mainstream news, WGN, has recently in the last year or two reported on the fact that there does appear to be clear evidence that Gacy had accomplices.
[02:44:49.433 --> 02:45:01.926]   And particularly one of the accomplices that's most relevant in regard to Gacy was that he was part of a network of underage P-R-O-N, if you know what I mean, right?
[02:45:02.786 --> 02:45:10.290]  He was connected to a guy, John David Norman, who worked with a guy named Paskey, and Paskey was the associate working with Gacy.
[02:45:10.730 --> 02:45:20.274]  So John David Norman, at that time, in the 70s and 80s, was the most prolific, underage, young man, porn kind of person, putting this material out.
[02:45:21.095 --> 02:45:25.766]   And then he gets busted, but his Note cards.
[02:45:25.786 --> 02:45:30.950]  He had famously these collections of note cards of high-profile people where he sold his materials to.
[02:45:31.410 --> 02:45:31.870]  What do you know?
[02:45:31.910 --> 02:45:33.912]  The note cards all happened to disappear.
[02:45:34.938 --> 02:45:41.502]  But what's interesting is that the connections between Paskey and John David Norman and John Wayne Gacy have now been confirmed.
[02:45:41.522 --> 02:45:42.783]  That actually was the case.
[02:45:42.823 --> 02:45:43.203]  That is true.
[02:45:43.223 --> 02:45:52.329]  So what that suggests is networks, higher level connections, which many of the serial killers had actually talked about, including Berkowitz, including Gacy.
[02:45:52.850 --> 02:45:57.373]  But a lot of people said, oh, well, you can't, you know, believe them because they're, you know, crazy killers.
[02:45:57.393 --> 02:46:00.915]  Well, maybe, but not everything that they say is false.
[02:46:02.652 --> 02:46:10.856]  And so it's entirely possible in the case of Bundy, again, oddities in the case of Bundy escaping from police and prison twice.
[02:46:11.757 --> 02:46:13.738]  Police custody, prison.
[02:46:14.778 --> 02:46:21.542]  I mean, might have a little aid from the inside to be able to do that twice in a row.
[02:46:21.562 --> 02:46:23.403]  I mean, unless he's just like super slick, right?
[02:46:23.423 --> 02:46:26.044]  He's like the most genius slick guy ever.
[02:46:27.365 --> 02:46:32.117]   To me, it seems Implausible unless there is perhaps police help.
[02:46:32.137 --> 02:46:41.166]  And in the case of Gacy, he was a, what do you call it when you're like a volunteer cop?
[02:46:41.186 --> 02:46:44.609]  I don't know what the term is, but he was part of law enforcement.
[02:46:44.629 --> 02:46:51.976]  So one of the ways that he was able to get away with a lot of his crimes for so long was that he had this inside police level connection.
[02:46:52.907 --> 02:46:55.248]  Not saying all the police are serial killers, they're all doing this.
[02:46:55.288 --> 02:47:05.111]  But in many cases, in the serial killer cases, there do at times appear to be police corruption and police assistance and or cover-ups on the part of some of the police.
[02:47:05.672 --> 02:47:12.294]  And this was actually something that we do see in the Gacy case.
[02:47:13.702 --> 02:47:17.662]   In regard to Henry Lee Lucas, we see similar situations where Lucas appeared to have had
[02:47:17.662 --> 02:47:19.881]  protection on the part of the cops.
[02:47:19.881 --> 02:47:23.942]   One thing that's odd about the Henry Lee Lucas case is that the number of people that he
[02:47:23.942 --> 02:47:28.202]   claimed and that the police said he did is almost humanly impossible.
[02:47:28.202 --> 02:47:33.721]   So whether that was a protected contract killing situation with Henry Lee Lucas or whether
[02:47:33.721 --> 02:47:39.721]   that was something that they were just trying to clear up, cover up a bunch of old cases
[02:47:39.721 --> 02:47:41.643]  and just pin it on that crazy old guy.
[02:47:41.687 --> 02:47:42.127]  Who knows?
[02:47:42.788 --> 02:47:49.291]  But again, that satanic cult connection there is clearly there with Henry Henry Lee Lucas and has been confirmed.
[02:47:49.958 --> 02:48:04.393]  Now in the case of Richard Ramirez, probably the most famous of the open Satanist killers, he appears to have been introduced to the Satanic stuff via, I think, his cousin or his uncle who was in Vietnam and was in some degree a Satanist.
[02:48:04.833 --> 02:48:10.059]  This allowed Richard Ramirez, oddly enough, to meet Anton LaVey back in the 70s or 80s.
[02:48:11.620 --> 02:48:24.406]  A lot of people don't know this, but the more recent BTK killer, who appeared to have been a humble evangelical Lutheran elder, adamant and active in his local Boy Scouts and church.
[02:48:24.827 --> 02:48:29.249]  I think he was part of the Neighborhood Watch, so not full law enforcement, but part of the Neighborhood Watch.
[02:48:30.509 --> 02:48:39.854]  He later admitted, no, actually he, and again, we can't always believe what they say, but he claimed to have been possessed by two spirits that he was very aware of.
[02:48:40.906 --> 02:48:49.533]  One demon named Batter and one named Factor X. A lot of people don't know that, but he claimed to have been involved in some degree of demonic possession.
[02:48:50.634 --> 02:48:57.420]  Whether he was an occultist, I don't know, but one thing that a lot of people don't look at either is that the serial killers, for the most part, they all do art.
[02:48:58.220 --> 02:49:04.285]  So there's this weird underground thing where serial killers sell their art to fans.
[02:49:04.345 --> 02:49:16.274]   I think this is all sick and disgusting, but If you look at BTK's artwork, he actually puts quite a bit of zodiac-type symbolism, esoteric symbolism.
[02:49:16.414 --> 02:49:19.757]  It's always, in many cases, very psychedelic.
[02:49:20.257 --> 02:49:21.218]  Why that is, I don't know.
[02:49:21.258 --> 02:49:25.701]  It could be the law of the serial killers were experimenting with LSD.
[02:49:26.062 --> 02:49:30.905]  In many cases, we do know that, for example, Son of Sam had done LSD.
[02:49:31.146 --> 02:49:35.249]  There you see, I think that's BTK killer art there.
[02:49:35.965 --> 02:49:43.692]  Always very trippy, very psychedelic, and at times he will put Mandala symbolism in there, and he'll put astrological symbolism in there.
[02:49:45.154 --> 02:49:50.879]  And again, he claims, yes, they can lie, you know, they can try to get out of the guilt.
[02:49:50.999 --> 02:49:53.421]  Oh, I'm an NPD, DID, I'm not guilty.
[02:49:53.441 --> 02:49:56.424]  And maybe they are, maybe they are, I don't know, right?
[02:49:56.864 --> 02:49:58.246]  Maybe they are possessed, right?
[02:49:58.566 --> 02:49:59.627]  Any of these things are possible.
[02:50:00.788 --> 02:50:12.980]  Probably one of the worst, though, that people don't know about is David Parker Ray, the Toy Box Killer, who would sort of take in women that he found off the streets and he would... I'm not going to say what he did, but it was very nasty.
[02:50:13.020 --> 02:50:13.740]  It was one of the worst.
[02:50:14.221 --> 02:50:17.804]  But he also claimed to be part of a small satanic sect.
[02:50:18.245 --> 02:50:24.371]  I'm not going to tell you to look up his drawings and artwork because it's pretty gross, but you can clearly see that in the drawings and artwork that he did.
[02:50:26.256 --> 02:50:33.903]  Herb Baumeister is an odd guy and there were bones found strewn throughout his yard at this big farm that he had purchased.
[02:50:34.584 --> 02:50:35.365]  Yeah, there you go.
[02:50:35.405 --> 02:50:37.367]  That's Toy Box Killer's thing there.
[02:50:37.467 --> 02:50:47.437]  And then in regard to Herb Baumeister, there were pentagrams and inverted crosses drawn nearby on the barns where he had done his murders.
[02:50:49.287 --> 02:50:59.679]  In regard to, I think this is in Chicago, the Ripper Crew, a famous serial killer group of four guys, they were also a small satanic sect and they were engaged in cannibalism.
[02:50:59.699 --> 02:51:03.243]  The Dutro Affair, as we mentioned before, that clearly had satanic connections.
[02:51:03.283 --> 02:51:08.068]  That's mentioned in the Irish Times and the Guardian that I mentioned earlier.
[02:51:08.550 --> 02:51:13.351]  The Monster of Florence, Italy, a serial killer there who was a satanic cult connected guy.
[02:51:13.591 --> 02:51:17.312]  The cannibal Armin Meiweis was into the occult satanism.
[02:51:17.472 --> 02:51:19.833]  Israel Keyes, as we said, was into that.
[02:51:21.873 --> 02:51:25.094]  And Order of the Solar Temple.
[02:51:25.154 --> 02:51:27.815]  I just did a talk over on Rockfin on my Rockfin channel.
[02:51:28.015 --> 02:51:32.176]  I did a whole talk on the Order of the Solar Temple, another satanic suicide cult.
[02:51:32.556 --> 02:51:33.656]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:33.696 --> 02:51:35.156]  This is Jay Dyer of Jays Analysis.
[02:51:35.176 --> 02:52:05.367]   We were going through the list of serial killers with Satanic and or occult connections and beliefs and I'd mentioned Israel keys who was more recent and pretty prominent in terms of open Satanism and his belief in Magic and they're sort of taking on the power of the victims through you know Occult practices and and there was other serial killers as well Adriana Adrian Lima or Jimmy Adrian Adrian Lim Sean Sellers and
[02:52:05.902 --> 02:52:18.553]  There is the case of the Order of the Solar Temple, which I just mentioned, which was a Canadian, French, Swiss, Switzerland-based cult, which was prominent in the 90s because they were kind of like Heaven's Gate, a mass suicide cult.
[02:52:18.573 --> 02:52:22.452]   So you notice this weird pattern of Jonestown, Heaven's Gate,
[02:52:22.452 --> 02:52:30.972]   Order of the Solar Temple, who had drawn heavily from Crowley, from the Golden Dawn, to create this gradation
[02:52:30.972 --> 02:52:37.173]  of a new graded degrees in terms of a new Templar cult.
[02:52:37.173 --> 02:52:43.693]   So the Order of the Solar Temple was this attempt at resurrecting medieval Templarism.
[02:52:43.693 --> 02:52:49.022]   And they were also an end times cult, which believed that they would have to commit infant
[02:52:49.022 --> 02:52:52.813]   sacrifice to stop the Antichrist from being born.
[02:52:52.813 --> 02:52:55.493]  Now, that's all pretty wild.
[02:52:55.493 --> 02:53:01.853]   But as we often see with a lot of these cults, you look at Osho and the documentary about his cult
[02:53:01.853 --> 02:53:04.052]  that was famous on Netflix a few years ago.
[02:53:03.466 --> 02:53:13.211]  It turns out other things seem to be going on there, such as high-level arms trafficking and money laundering, which usually connects to intelligence and organized crime.
[02:53:13.511 --> 02:53:22.036]  And of course, that's what we see with the Order of the Silver Temple as well, that their cult was also involved in pretty high-level money laundering and arms trafficking.
[02:53:23.237 --> 02:53:33.504]  Another case that's very important of recent note is the North Fox Island case and the executives from some prominent automobile corporations.
[02:53:33.564 --> 02:53:42.931]  Now, this is not a recent case, but recently come to light in regard to the satanic and Epstein-style connections at the North Fox Island.
[02:53:42.951 --> 02:53:50.676]  So this seems to be a children's retreat from the 70s, and that's up in like the Michigan Finger Lakes area or whatever.
[02:53:51.650 --> 02:54:01.334]  And you had these people who were engaged in high-level, compromise-style operations where they were filming it, where there was full-on satanic ritual abuse going on.
[02:54:02.055 --> 02:54:09.578]  And this has come out in regard to a recent famous podcast series that you may or may not have heard of if you're interested in this stuff called The Clown and the Candyman.
[02:54:10.313 --> 02:54:14.737]  That was really where this connection between, I think his name is Dean Corl.
[02:54:14.817 --> 02:54:25.466]  He's the Candyman, a Texas-based serial killer who operated in a very similar way to what Gacy did in terms of the BDSM elements, BTK elements, right?
[02:54:25.486 --> 02:54:36.254]  But in the case of Dean Corl, he had ties to figures, I can't remember if it was Paskey, but in the same way it connected to Gacy, right?
[02:54:36.294 --> 02:54:37.816]  Because they were doing the same types of stuff.
[02:54:37.836 --> 02:55:00.801]   So we have a connection between Gacy The Candyman and to John David Norman and there's connections in the Clown and Candyman installments about seven or eight installments of this very in-depth podcast that connects it to the North Fox Island case and the satanic elements of the elite executives that were being flown out to those to those islands and retreats.
[02:55:02.287 --> 02:55:14.873]  Also, as we mentioned, another high-profile case, Myra Hindley and Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe, all happened to be BFF with Jimmy Savile.
[02:55:15.393 --> 02:55:29.320]  So, a lot of theories and speculations over the years that Jimmy Savile was also involved in murders, not just a creeper pedo and a necrophiliac, but perhaps also involved because he was openly close friends with these famous serial killers.
[02:55:29.921 --> 02:55:32.462]  Who themselves had a witch cult, right?
[02:55:32.482 --> 02:55:34.303]  So they were known to have a witch cult.
[02:55:35.163 --> 02:55:49.490]  And a couple other cases that can be mentioned, as we said, the satanic panic picked up in part due to, you know, Geraldo's series where he was covering, you know, satanic murderers.
[02:55:49.530 --> 02:56:02.046]   And he did a focus on Bobby Berdella, but it turns out Bobby Berdella actually was in some degree seeing himself as a cult leader. Now, I don't recall how satanic it was. He had
[02:56:02.046 --> 02:56:10.686]   this oddity shop where he sold Bobby's Bizarre Bordello or something like that. And in the
[02:56:10.686 --> 02:56:15.646]   case of his stuff, he had like shrunken skulls and then people debate whether that
[02:56:15.646 --> 02:56:20.556]   was real or what. But turns out that he had this sort of BDSM sex cult where he was the
[02:56:20.556 --> 02:56:25.556]   head of the cult and he was locking people up, imprisoning them. And the house ended up stinking
[02:56:25.556 --> 02:56:29.736]   up and there were occult symbols and things connected to Bobby Bordello. So I would
[02:56:29.736 --> 02:56:34.115]   say in the case of Bobby Bordello, even though Geraldo might have sensationalized it, it seems
[02:56:34.115 --> 02:56:39.447]   like it really was there. There was something to that in regard to the satanism and the occult.
[02:56:39.400 --> 02:56:44.183]  So what I want to talk about now, because there's a lot more information, you can go really deep with a lot of this stuff.
[02:56:44.203 --> 02:56:51.829]  For example, I just heard recently that I didn't even know that Sirhan Sirhan was connected to the Process Cult, right?
[02:56:52.149 --> 02:57:03.278]  I knew that he had connections and interests in Rosicrucianism and that he claims that he was mind-controlled and dissociative in a dissociative state because he doesn't remember supposedly what happened that day.
[02:57:03.298 --> 02:57:05.480]  Again, who knows if that's the case or not.
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:06.240]  He could be lying.
[02:57:06.420 --> 02:57:06.821]  We don't know.
[02:57:08.012 --> 02:57:14.697]  What is interesting is that he also seems to have had times where he would attend the Process Church meetings.
[02:57:15.098 --> 02:57:26.226]  So here we have, again, Process Church connecting not just to Berkowitz, because Berkowitz is involved in a shoot-off of Process, which was the family.
[02:57:27.127 --> 02:57:35.213]  And then that's connected to Savile via the magazine Process, which, by the way, Charles Manson wrote articles for.
[02:57:35.802 --> 02:57:49.874]  So Manson was literally writing articles for the Process Church Magazine, where Sabal was writing articles and being interviewed, at the same time as the Process Church was split off of Scientology.
[02:57:50.595 --> 02:58:06.107]   Started by a guy named Robert de Grimston, who was himself this sort of Luciferian, satanic figure who had, if I recall, been involved in some pedo stuff, and had left the Roman Catholic priesthood studying for that priesthood to start this cult of his own.
[02:58:06.107 --> 02:58:10.597]   And it had these really, you know, degrees and gradations. It was a very elaborate structure
[02:58:10.597 --> 02:58:15.757]   to the cult that he and I think his wife had started in the UK. They brought it over here. Yeah,
[02:58:15.757 --> 02:58:19.736]   there's the process. Obviously, he's trying to look like Jesus. And the weird thing about
[02:58:19.736 --> 02:58:24.627]   process is that the philosophy of this cult was this Manson philosophy.
[02:58:24.926 --> 02:58:33.957]  It was this idea that we're going to instantiate the apocalypse through the occult process and that Jesus and Satan are the same.
[02:58:34.017 --> 02:58:35.980]  They're like flip sides of the same coin.
[02:58:36.812 --> 02:58:40.256]  This is probably where Manson got that weird, I'm God and the devil.
[02:58:40.536 --> 02:58:42.478]  I'm Jesus and I'm loose for all at once.
[02:58:42.898 --> 02:58:43.959]  I'm in your mind, right?
[02:58:43.979 --> 02:58:46.262]  When he, that's literally the Manson philosophy, right?
[02:58:46.462 --> 02:58:47.703]  And that's the philosophy of this cult.
[02:58:48.143 --> 02:58:52.608]  We know that Manson had an interest in this because again, he, there's a, there's an article he wrote for the magazine.
[02:58:55.006 --> 02:59:00.291]  So, uh, that also connects again to Sirhan Sirhan, which I didn't even know that until fairly recently.
[02:59:00.751 --> 02:59:08.258]  So there's always these, you know, these new, interesting, fascinating details that pop up in regard to these serial killers and a lot of stuff newly emerges, right?
[02:59:08.338 --> 02:59:15.044]  Again, Maury Terry's, a lot of his research has been vindicated in regard to a Netflix documentary of all things.
[02:59:15.064 --> 02:59:21.650]  I mean, that's not the last place I would have expected there to be any vindication, but, uh, somehow amazingly, uh, right.
[02:59:21.690 --> 02:59:30.572]   The, um, The Maury Terry suspicions, for example, about who had committed the occult murder of Arliss Perry, that turned out to be correct.
[02:59:30.632 --> 02:59:36.773]  At the end of the documentary, if I recall, they bust the guy who Maury Terry had theorized had done that.
[02:59:38.833 --> 02:59:42.594]  And curiously enough, that guy had a copy of Maury Terry's book.
[02:59:42.974 --> 02:59:43.334]  Interesting.
[02:59:43.854 --> 02:59:47.815]  So the serial killer patterns, let's look at the real patterns that I've noticed.
[02:59:48.399 --> 02:59:57.424]  Contrary to what supposedly the normie mainstream official narrative, just like the normie mainstream official narrative of lone gunmen, right?
[02:59:57.864 --> 02:59:59.345]  It's different when it comes to serial killers.
[03:00:00.986 --> 03:00:11.953]  Serial killers sometimes have a messiah complex where they see themselves as gods or savior figures of the human race and that their actions are actually ritual actions that will heal or change the world.
[03:00:11.993 --> 03:00:12.613]  Not in every case.
[03:00:13.297 --> 03:00:19.706]  In many cases, they're actually filming it, and they seem to have accomplices, which could suggest something more than just a murder.
[03:00:19.726 --> 03:00:24.353]  It could suggest a contract killing or SNUFF types of operations.
[03:00:24.954 --> 03:00:29.360]  A lot of times, they have connections to organized crime, which is not often admitted or highlighted.
[03:00:30.001 --> 03:00:42.366]  Many cases, they are people who were traumatized and abused and in some way, obviously, relationships with their parents were difficult, but they might have also had sexual or ritual abuse in their youth.
[03:00:42.686 --> 03:00:49.449]  They seem to, in many cases, have high-level international and powerful connections, which is odd given that they're typically weirdo oddballs.
[03:00:49.669 --> 03:00:55.012]   Why do we have John Wayne Gacy hanging out with Rose Carter, Jimmy Carter's wife.
[03:00:55.112 --> 03:00:58.915]  Why do we have Jeffrey Dahmer being able to call up Walter Mondale?
[03:00:58.955 --> 03:01:04.339]  I think it calls the vice president's office and gets his whole class taken into the vice president's office.
[03:01:04.479 --> 03:01:08.002]  That's an odd thing for a random weirdo kid to do.
[03:01:08.502 --> 03:01:10.384]  Many of them have MPD or DID.
[03:01:10.784 --> 03:01:12.946]  Many of them are connected to drug trafficking rings.
[03:01:13.106 --> 03:01:17.409]  Many of them have, as we said, high-level military or assassin training.
[03:01:17.550 --> 03:01:18.530]  Look at Wayne Williams.
[03:01:18.570 --> 03:01:26.516]   There's a whole interview where Wayne Williams says, Well, I was trained as part of a youth CIA program, but I'm not supposed to talk about that.
[03:01:26.576 --> 03:01:27.796]  Now, again, he could be lying.
[03:01:27.816 --> 03:01:29.696]  These people do lie, but maybe he's not lying.
[03:01:30.617 --> 03:01:37.198]  Oftentimes, these networks are connected to human trafficking, as we mentioned, the occult and satanic elements.
[03:01:38.178 --> 03:01:40.858]  We find out that they don't often have ideal victims.
[03:01:40.878 --> 03:01:46.959]  In many cases, the victims are all over the board, which could suggest, again, contract killing or ritual killing.
[03:01:47.499 --> 03:01:54.432]   Sometimes the murders do occur on important occult This is an attack on the world economy.
[03:01:54.732 --> 03:01:56.614]  That's the prime result we get out of this.
[03:01:56.453 --> 03:02:00.654]   are part of the long-term prison mind control complex, and many of them are killed in prison,
[03:02:00.654 --> 03:02:04.132]  which could suggest covering up the truth getting out.
[03:02:04.132 --> 03:02:05.773]  This is an attack on the world economy.
[03:02:05.773 --> 03:02:09.693]  That's the prime result we get out of this.
[03:02:09.693 --> 03:02:15.623]   We're gonna face economic problems that come from this We're going to face military crises.
[03:02:15.643 --> 03:02:18.344]  We're going to face cultural and spiritual crises.
[03:02:18.384 --> 03:02:25.708]  And we're going to see the UN further throw third world populations at borders of the West and attempt to break the West.
[03:02:26.248 --> 03:02:28.329]  Suddenly, the world's going bankrupt.
[03:02:28.389 --> 03:02:29.830]  Suddenly, your savings are gone.
[03:02:30.030 --> 03:02:35.673]  The New World Order elite types are going to try to trigger a financial collapse.
[03:02:36.513 --> 03:02:38.414]  This is the mass culling.
[03:02:38.635 --> 03:02:41.016]  When the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[03:02:42.034 --> 03:03:04.885]  I could play you clip after clip for hours of going back 30 months ago, and 20 months ago, and 10 months ago, and a month ago, where I told you there'd be hyperinflation, I told you there'd be food shortages, I told you the price of food would explode, because it's an IMF, World Bank, globalist plan they've already carried out for decades in third world countries, and now they're doing it.
[03:03:05.418 --> 03:03:09.124]  A dire new report forces US UK to change course on coronavirus strategy.
[03:03:09.445 --> 03:03:11.588]  Now you're going to be locked up for 18 months.
[03:03:12.269 --> 03:03:12.329]  Oh!
[03:03:13.717 --> 03:03:16.318]  That's gonna cause a depression within a month of this crap.
[03:03:16.698 --> 03:03:17.538]  But that's okay.
[03:03:17.858 --> 03:03:22.539]  Now the depression isn't the banker's fault or the politicians, it's all the virus.
[03:03:22.859 --> 03:03:25.719]  So now they can really screw you over.
[03:03:26.020 --> 03:03:36.642]  This has been the plan stated to cut off your carbon, to cut off your life, to cut off your mobility, to absolutely bring you down to a below a third world status.
[03:03:36.982 --> 03:03:53.258]   And when you de-industrialize and you collapse the first world, just the estimates Put out by Russia and the United States and Lord Monkton has his own, that if they did a 50% carbon cut like they wanted by 2025, they wanted the deal in place by 2008, didn't happen.
[03:03:55.896 --> 03:03:59.638]  That over a billion people would starve to death in the first decade.
[03:03:59.979 --> 03:04:03.601]  That's a b-b-b-b-b-b-billion!
[03:04:03.781 --> 03:04:12.807]  They've got a whole societal collapse program, how it brings down the hospitals and brings down the civilization, then there's a collapse, and then the general masses are starving to death.
[03:04:13.467 --> 03:04:22.695]  And so those that still have wealth that aren't part of the system are told, you've got to sign on and put your wealth into this to stabilize and save all these people that are dying and starving.
[03:04:23.295 --> 03:04:29.060]  And then basically you sign your wealth over to this big giant global wallet that they're going to be rolling out.
[03:04:29.580 --> 03:04:32.903]  And you and your whole family are in extreme danger of being murdered.
[03:04:33.444 --> 03:04:33.964]  Extreme danger.
[03:04:34.685 --> 03:04:37.880]   And It's not just from the virus they're going to release.
[03:04:38.561 --> 03:04:44.282]  It's from the collapse of civilization that's going to ensue that they're then going to organize to consolidate power.
[03:04:45.022 --> 03:05:02.387]  The only way to beat these people is to understand their game plan and to understand they've just started their inflationary system and to use the dollars you've got today to buy high quality storable food and other preparedness and survival items at low prices so that in the future you have what you need.
