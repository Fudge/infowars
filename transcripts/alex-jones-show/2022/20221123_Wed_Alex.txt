[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]  [BEEP]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.759]  It's Wednesday, November 23.
[00:00:14.797 --> 00:00:25.766]  We have a very, very special rebroadcast for you today made up of some of the most important guests we've recently had on with some of the most important topics.
[00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:36.749]   Coming up first in this hour is Steve Quayle on the war in Ukraine, the economy, and how at this point he believes there's not really a Temporal or political solution to our problems.
[00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:37.790]  It's all spiritual.
[00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.333]  That is coming up this hour, right after the break.
[00:00:41.473 --> 00:00:49.761]  Then, Martin Armstrong, one of the top economists, one of the best track records predicting what's really about to happen, lays out the real nature of the world economy and the U.S.
[00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:53.825]  economy in the hour after that, the second hour.
[00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:59.230]  And then, of course, a great interview we had about election fraud and all the information coming out with the crime spikes.
[00:01:00.123 --> 00:01:13.174]  Mike Lindell will be in the third hour, then Matt Baker will be in the first half hour of the fourth hour, and then of course MTG was on with us last week at Knox Island Park on so many fronts.
[00:01:13.254 --> 00:01:18.319]  So that's what's coming up on this November 23rd Wednesday edition.
[00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:19.620]  I want to thank the listeners and viewers.
[00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.603]  For all your amazing support keeping us on air, I'm very, very thankful this Thanksgiving that we haven't had nuclear war.
[00:01:24.623 --> 00:01:26.665]  I'm very, very thankful that the world's awakening.
[00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:35.251]  I'm very, very thankful that even NBC News and others are admitting that the poison death shots are causing massive heart attacks, myocarditis, blood clots, and deaths.
[00:01:35.931 --> 00:01:44.257]  And I'm very sad that all these bad things happened, but there is a huge awakening and at least we are getting on a fighting footing politically, culturally.
[00:01:45.254 --> 00:01:49.242]  Economically, spiritually, and to defend ourselves physically.
[00:01:49.303 --> 00:01:51.868]  So I am extremely thankful to the crew on this Thanksgiving.
[00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:55.235]  I am infinitely thankful to God, of course, number one.
[00:01:56.603 --> 00:02:01.187]  And I'm just beyond thankful to the incredible listeners and viewers that make everything we do here possible.
[00:02:01.907 --> 00:02:04.769]  They attack all of our American institutions.
[00:02:05.309 --> 00:02:07.911]  They attacked Thanksgiving last year saying, don't go to it.
[00:02:08.612 --> 00:02:10.213]  Don't be around unvaccinated people.
[00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:17.258]  But then Borla, Pfizer, gets up and says that, oh, the right wing was mean to AIDS patients and said, don't get close to them during the 1980s.
[00:02:17.678 --> 00:02:20.200]  But, oh, anybody that might have a virus is toxic.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.082]  Don't be around them unless you've had a shot.
[00:02:22.902 --> 00:02:28.332]  Which we now know creates a spike protein and basically infects people with the same thing as the virus.
[00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:29.233]  It's just insane.
[00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:32.900]  So I'm extremely thankful that we're still on air and I cannot express to you enough.
[00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:35.592]  How amazing the awakening is.
[00:02:35.632 --> 00:02:39.115]  Again, you're not public figures, most of you, so you don't realize how big the awakening is.
[00:02:39.656 --> 00:02:40.537]  I am a public figure.
[00:02:41.297 --> 00:02:47.022]  And just yesterday, I had breakfast with an unnamed, very well-known household name public figure.
[00:02:48.283 --> 00:03:04.144]   And he expressed to me the same findings, that there's really a giant underground awakening, not just one on the surface, and that in meetings with large groups of members of Congress, who you wouldn't think they're Alex Jones fans, Most of them are rapidly becoming listeners.
[00:03:04.765 --> 00:03:06.146]  So we've definitely hit the zeitgeist.
[00:03:07.227 --> 00:03:16.696]  That's why they had the Democratic Party in a big fake news article in the Washington Post a few days ago, after the Sandy Hook family sued Alex Jones and began to move money around.
[00:03:17.357 --> 00:03:18.478]  Nothing is true in the article.
[00:03:18.518 --> 00:03:25.264]  It's all disinfo, except their statement at the end that, oh, he won't have to pay us really any money if he just goes off the air.
[00:03:26.246 --> 00:03:27.427]  And goes back into private life.
[00:03:28.127 --> 00:03:30.948]  We just want Alex Jones to go back into private life and just go away.
[00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.490]  Well, I mean, now I can't go into private life.
[00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.212]  Truth is, five, six years ago, I was thinking about phasing out within five years, just doing a podcast once a week and writing books.
[00:03:39.272 --> 00:03:54.320]  But because you want to take us off air, because everything we've said is coming true, because our credibility is so high, because people are counting on us, especially the unborn babies whose mothers are getting injected and having miscarriages, and the little babies being given the COVID shots, and the children, and everybody else, I'm never going off air until I'm dead.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.485]  So your attempts to silence me have only made me redouble my efforts and my commitment to fighting the tyrants.
[00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:05.409]  So I'm very, very thankful for God giving me will and strength and focus and discernment.
[00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:09.532]  I'm very thankful to my parents for raising me good and being loving and strong and the rest of my family.
[00:04:09.952 --> 00:04:17.399]  And I'm, again, just incredibly thankful to the listeners, the crew, everybody that makes this transmission possible, our sponsors, our affiliates, everybody.
[00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:25.346]  Please remember on this Thanksgiving to also give Thanksgiving to God for the great compounds he gave us in nature to have good immune systems, be healthy and happy.

[00:05:57.626 --> 00:06:06.245]  (dramatic music)
[00:06:06.245 --> 00:06:12.245]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:06:12.245 --> 00:06:17.766]   It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:19.766]  [Music]
[00:06:19.215 --> 00:06:31.779]  He was on with us one month ago and he repeatedly said they will use an errant missile out of Ukraine to blame Russia with a false flag and escalate the war and bring NATO in.
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:36.840]  Steve Quill joins us today.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.221]  He was already set up a week ago.
[00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:41.101]  This is synchronicity, serendipity of the Lord at work.
[00:06:41.682 --> 00:06:42.682]  I want to get to that with him.
[00:06:43.632 --> 00:06:46.933]  I want to get to FDX and how it can bring down the whole house of cards.
[00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:49.074]  I agree with him and his expert analysis on that.
[00:06:49.114 --> 00:06:49.614]  We'll get that.
[00:06:50.414 --> 00:06:55.676]  There's only a few people out there that expose the New World Order at a greater level than I did before I did.
[00:06:55.716 --> 00:07:00.437]  It's not about the credit, but it's about understanding who was awake first so we can understand who has the discernment.
[00:07:01.077 --> 00:07:02.738]  And it was Steve Quayle and David Icke.
[00:07:03.738 --> 00:07:07.059]  Both great minds, both ahead of their times, and both living legends.
[00:07:07.179 --> 00:07:09.440]  And Steve Quayle obviously needs an introduction.
[00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.461]  He's here with us for the rest of the hour today.
[00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:16.030]  But the first thing I wanted to hit was this.
[00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:22.372]  Two years ago, they had the official ADL Summit in D.C.
[00:07:23.372 --> 00:07:28.594]  and Sacha Baron Cohen, who made his money off absolutely horrible, disgusting comedy.
[00:07:28.874 --> 00:07:31.015]  Some of it's funny, some of it's just really disgusting.
[00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:33.656]  But all granted, he's funny sometimes.
[00:07:34.156 --> 00:07:35.136]  Free speech allowed him to do it.
[00:07:35.176 --> 00:07:39.558]  He called for my arrest for talking about replacement theory.
[00:07:40.238 --> 00:07:41.158]  Well, it's not a theory.
[00:07:41.618 --> 00:07:42.059]  The U.N.
[00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:54.806]   has an official plan of the replacement migration program since the 60s and they admit and French presidents talk about it and British prime ministers and American presidents and I have all the UN documents.
[00:07:56.226 --> 00:08:02.389]  This is why they sell euthanasia, abortion, sterile chemicals in the food and water so we can't have children.
[00:08:03.729 --> 00:08:07.371]  So poor third world populations can be brought in as a permanent underclass.
[00:08:09.736 --> 00:08:18.744]  So, now, Chuckie Schumer came out today, this just broke an hour ago, and calls for amnesty for all 11 million undocumented migrants in the U.S.
[00:08:18.764 --> 00:08:23.427]  because the American population is not reproducing on its own at the same level as it used to.
[00:08:23.808 --> 00:08:26.150]  So, direct replacement migration statement.
[00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:26.950]  We'll play the clip in a moment.
[00:08:28.311 --> 00:08:29.873]  Jamie White, powered out.
[00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:32.100]  A quick article on this.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:32.940]  Great replacement.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.443]  Schumer calls for a blanket amnesty of millions of illegals to offset declining U.S.
[00:08:38.483 --> 00:08:39.043]  population.
[00:08:39.423 --> 00:08:42.385]  Here's another article we wrote five years ago.
[00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:43.285]  Revealed U.N.
[00:08:43.325 --> 00:08:47.287]  plan to flood America with 600 million migrants for replacement migration.
[00:08:47.367 --> 00:08:47.968]  Their word.
[00:08:47.988 --> 00:08:49.088]  It has the documents in it.
[00:08:49.468 --> 00:08:50.289]  But don't believe me.
[00:08:51.369 --> 00:08:51.729]  The U.N.
[00:08:51.769 --> 00:08:54.791]  is pushing the dangerous replacement migration conspiracy theory.
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.220]  On their website.
[00:08:57.741 --> 00:09:00.202]  And here is the actual documents.
[00:09:00.582 --> 00:09:01.302]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:01.982 --> 00:09:05.184]  Population, division, department, economic and social affairs, United Nations, 2000.
[00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:09.185]  And that was in the year 2000.
[00:09:09.585 --> 00:09:11.066]  And there's a bunch of others.
[00:09:11.126 --> 00:09:16.768]  So, the ADL says if you criticize forced injections, you're a Nazi and should be banned, debanked and arrested.
[00:09:16.808 --> 00:09:17.489]  Literally arrested.
[00:09:18.476 --> 00:09:25.081]  All of this, FTX is involved, blocking therapeutics and helping run censorship with the ADL, same deal.
[00:09:25.721 --> 00:09:29.764]  So it all ties together, ladies and gentlemen, is a big deal.
[00:09:30.084 --> 00:09:37.589]  Here is Chuckie Schumer literally announcing replacement migration, but if you talk about it, you get destroyed.
[00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:39.170]  These people are incredible.
[00:09:39.431 --> 00:09:39.751]  Here it is.
[00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:43.738]  Now more than ever, we're short of workers.
[00:09:44.939 --> 00:09:51.405]  We have a population that is not reproducing it on its own with the same level that it used to.
[00:09:51.985 --> 00:10:07.238]   The only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the dreamers, and all of them, because our ultimate goal is to help the dreamers but get a path to citizenship for all 11 million or however many undocumented There are here.
[00:10:07.318 --> 00:10:08.960]  And all the smuggled kids they bring in.
[00:10:09.361 --> 00:10:10.842]  So a big, big deal.
[00:10:10.862 --> 00:10:12.064]  I wanted to start with that first.
[00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:16.489]  Obviously, the strikes out of Ukraine attacking Poland.
[00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.355]  Lloyd Austin saying, yeah, Ukraine attacked Poland, but it's Russia's fault.
[00:10:21.475 --> 00:10:22.616]  Actual video, that's coming up.
[00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:24.299]  F-T-X, all of it.
[00:10:24.319 --> 00:10:27.504]  But Steve Quayle, SteveQuayle.com, best-selling author and researcher.
[00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:28.646]  We sell some of your amazing books.
[00:10:29.107 --> 00:10:31.691]  DimpleWarStore.com, you can find all your books at SteveQuayle.com.
[00:10:32.052 --> 00:10:33.875]  Steve, wow, what a time to be alive.
[00:10:34.035 --> 00:10:37.641]  Everything you predicted 30-plus years ago now is here.
[00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:56.829]   Well, Alex, I think the topic of obviously Schumer's request to we're not reproducing ourselves just because they're they're basically the government is killing off American citizens through, in my opinion, obviously, vaccinations, obviously, Through abortion, infanticide.
[00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.052]  But most importantly, I think the people in this country have got to understand this.
[00:11:01.492 --> 00:11:03.573]  Liberty once lost is lost forever.
[00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.274]  And that was John Adams.
[00:11:05.374 --> 00:11:06.935]  And this is the bigger issue.
[00:11:07.255 --> 00:11:09.356]  Because liberty, we used to have freedom of speech.
[00:11:09.776 --> 00:11:15.660]  And I would say this, that anybody who thinks that is still in existence, really has been mind controlled.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:23.184]  And what this whole theater of the political realm, in my opinion, I just make it kind of like pig Latin, but it's politicus distracticus.
[00:11:23.604 --> 00:11:32.866]  Because they just are distracting and obviously preoccupying the American people with, I would call this, trivial pursuit.
[00:11:32.966 --> 00:11:37.887]  Trivial pursuit is how can anything change in the midterms?
[00:11:37.947 --> 00:11:47.268]  And as you know, I'm on record, I said the midterms will change nothing because the same forces that stole the presidency would steal the midterms.
[00:11:47.709 --> 00:11:49.789]  No offense, but that couldn't be any more accurate.
[00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:52.289]  Hold on, you just had a Freudian slip.
[00:11:52.629 --> 00:11:53.970]  You called them the mid-chains.
[00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.150]  Which is, the chains are still on.
[00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:57.410]  Of election fraud.
[00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.610]  Yes.
[00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:00.051]  Well, and here's the thing.
[00:12:00.571 --> 00:12:04.792]  Again, people are looking for a political solution to a spiritual problem.
[00:12:05.152 --> 00:12:14.253]  It's my contention that obviously the United States has declared, the Democrats specifically, and the Republican whores, have declared war on God.
[00:12:14.313 --> 00:12:17.374]  They've declared war on everything that made our country great.
[00:12:17.874 --> 00:12:26.596]  The destruction of the family, the destruction of a grateful nation versus the one that's basically, we're in a rape, pillage, and plunder.
[00:12:26.877 --> 00:12:28.997]  The United States has been taken under.
[00:12:29.417 --> 00:12:41.901]  And you know, when we watch what's going on, the heartbreak, why is it all these immigrants come in and they get huge amounts of government stipends, yet we have veterans sleeping and dying on the streets.
[00:12:41.961 --> 00:12:45.162]  And more so now... And being encouraged in Canada and the U.S.
[00:12:45.202 --> 00:12:46.062]  to kill themselves.
[00:12:47.250 --> 00:13:00.744]  Yep, and ladies and gentlemen, you know, the nation, and I want to say this, I'm responsible, don't get mad at the Alex's, but we are watching a nation that is dead on the inside expecting to change things on the outside.
[00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:04.992]  We have lost our gratefulness to the living God.
[00:13:05.032 --> 00:13:06.593]  We have lost our freedom, liberty.
[00:13:06.673 --> 00:13:08.894]  And again, John Adams nailed it.
[00:13:08.934 --> 00:13:11.216]  Liberty once lost is lost forever.
[00:13:11.616 --> 00:13:17.819]  But again, the political distraction, if you will, what I used to call circus ridiculous.
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:28.045]  We've got three rings going on continually, and that's to keep us off guard because we just have the most evil assemblage in the world at COP 27 in Egypt.
[00:13:29.827 --> 00:13:39.756]  And I think, Alex, everybody forgets what you've done, what I've done, all the those of us who have been around for decades on talk radio and obviously podcasting, broadcasting now.
[00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:43.039]  But we've quoted ad nauseum.
[00:13:43.139 --> 00:13:46.922]  These guys want to deliver the planet from pretty close.
[00:13:47.002 --> 00:13:49.324]  Ninety five percent of the people you and I covered.
[00:13:49.364 --> 00:13:50.125]  And this is important.
[00:13:50.845 --> 00:13:52.388]  Covered the Deagle Report.
[00:13:52.789 --> 00:13:56.936]  You can see the acceleration to get to 2025 in the Deagle Report.
[00:13:56.996 --> 00:14:02.265]  And explain from insurance corporate actuaries of a massive depopulated America.
[00:14:02.285 --> 00:14:04.129]  Tell people about the Deagle Report they don't know.
[00:14:05.413 --> 00:14:07.915]  Well, the Deagle Report was put out by John Deagle.
[00:14:08.155 --> 00:14:14.680]  It's like a think tank, but it was a Rockefeller-controlled and Rockefeller Foundation-controlled mouthpiece.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:29.051]  And by 2025, they're showing the population of the United States of America, and they've been doing this now for the past four or five years, maybe even longer than that, but by 2025, the American population would be brought down to 100 million or less.
[00:14:29.651 --> 00:14:31.773]  A hundred million or less.
[00:14:32.194 --> 00:14:36.819]  Ladies and gentlemen, that means 260 million plus people have got to be done away with.
[00:14:37.279 --> 00:15:04.075]   And what's problematic and provocative is when you understand that the zero population people and what we're seeing that just took place in Egypt We're seeing, in my opinion, the absolute Luciferian introduction to globalism to destroy every nation-state, obviously United States, Western Europe, obviously big-time Russia, and they hate Russia the most because Russia believes in their own country.
[00:15:04.415 --> 00:15:14.422]   I wish we would be as jealous for our country as all of these Disgusting politicos seem to want to help everybody else but make war on us.
[00:15:14.782 --> 00:15:28.575]  And how is it, Alex, seriously, how is it that with the FTX, and this is important, that the kleptocurrency, forget crypto, it was kleptocurrency, that tied to the Democratic Party, $37 billion.
[00:15:28.595 --> 00:15:30.237]  By the way, that's only face value.
[00:15:30.597 --> 00:15:32.539]  That's not, that's notional value.
[00:15:32.659 --> 00:15:34.581]  That's not the derivative value.
[00:15:35.001 --> 00:15:40.545]  Within days, there's a new cry to give Zelensky in the Ukraine another $37 billion.
[00:15:40.865 --> 00:15:46.969]  And so, what I think people have got to understand now, they no longer want to withhold the pillaging.
[00:15:47.289 --> 00:15:49.751]  It's going on, and people don't think anymore.
[00:15:50.131 --> 00:15:51.011]  Stay right there.
[00:15:51.032 --> 00:15:51.592]  Stay right there.
[00:15:51.612 --> 00:15:54.754]  I think what you're saying is, we're not in beta, they're in operational now.
[00:15:54.774 --> 00:15:56.575]  We're inside the new world order now.
[00:15:57.035 --> 00:15:59.157]  Like that old Johnny Cash song, you're in the jailhouse now.
[00:16:00.657 --> 00:16:07.101]  For only the second time in the entirety of the InfoWars store, we are announcing a selling out mega blowout sale.
[00:16:07.582 --> 00:16:16.008]  Many of our top selling items are included in this sale and are in limited supply, so once they're out, they will probably not be back in stock until next year.
[00:16:16.388 --> 00:16:20.511]  Everything is listed at deep discounts of up to 60% off market price.
[00:16:20.631 --> 00:16:26.275]  Plus, if you order now, we will include a free gift from the store for every order, regardless of what you buy.
[00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:33.498]  This item will be chosen at random from a hand-picked selection of our DVDs, books, stickers, and so much more.
[00:16:33.938 --> 00:16:38.760]  This is our gift to you for supporting the InfoWars and the Voice of Freedom worldwide.
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:49.885]  After the seemingly never-ending barrage of attacks on us, Alex and the rest of the crew here at InfoWars needs all the help we can get to allow the message of a pro-human future to reach the masses.
[00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:59.571]  Hurry to the store of InfoWars now to check out the mega blowout sale because some of these items are already selling out at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:17:00.531 --> 00:17:07.135]  In the modern world where they convince a woman to get a job, the man to get a job, they inflate the currency so nobody can exist any other way because it's too expensive.
[00:17:07.415 --> 00:17:08.816]  The parents are out working all day.
[00:17:08.836 --> 00:17:11.658]  The school and the internet and the matrix raise your children.
[00:17:11.738 --> 00:17:15.062]  Your children go to school all day and be told things that you may not want them to learn.
[00:17:15.182 --> 00:17:18.566]  Then they sit on the internet and read things and watch things you may not want them to watch.
[00:17:18.586 --> 00:17:21.068]  You talk to them for 10 minutes at the end of the day, they go to bed.
[00:17:21.108 --> 00:17:28.116]  You're fighting with your 10 minutes against endless hours of the most entertaining programming or the most forceful programming.
[00:17:28.156 --> 00:17:30.399]  In school it's forceful, on the internet it's entertaining.
[00:17:30.659 --> 00:17:33.182]  Convincing them of ideas that you perhaps don't agree with.
[00:17:33.482 --> 00:17:34.643]  I've seen it myself on YouTube.
[00:17:34.703 --> 00:17:39.167]  I've seen a guy in America driving his car and his kids were in the backseat and he was arguing with them about an issue.
[00:17:39.687 --> 00:17:40.909]  And he was like, where did you hear that?
[00:17:41.129 --> 00:17:41.429]  School?
[00:17:41.629 --> 00:17:43.110]  He's like, why did the school tell you that?
[00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:43.631]  That's not true.
[00:17:43.651 --> 00:17:46.694]  And his own children are arguing with him because they learned it in school.
[00:17:46.714 --> 00:17:48.195]  Have you ever tried to take your children out of school?
[00:17:48.395 --> 00:17:48.956]  You'll get fined.
[00:17:48.976 --> 00:17:49.596]  You'll get in trouble.
[00:17:49.656 --> 00:17:50.857]  No, your kids have to go to school.
[00:17:51.017 --> 00:17:52.599]  You have to give your kids away to the school.
[00:17:52.859 --> 00:17:55.842]  If you don't give your kids away to the brainwashing, you'll get in trouble.
[00:17:56.222 --> 00:18:07.850]   As an all-star fighter, Businessman, motivational speaker and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has truly earned the title of Top G. But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged the globalists.
[00:18:08.251 --> 00:18:13.394]  He is consecutively the most googled man in the world in the last two years.
[00:18:13.634 --> 00:18:18.258]  And that's because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.
[00:18:18.738 --> 00:18:24.463]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.
[00:18:25.004 --> 00:18:27.386]  Introducing Top G Supplements.
[00:18:27.966 --> 00:18:32.971]  We are proud to introduce and sponsor the Top G line of supplements by Andrew Tate and his crew.
[00:18:33.251 --> 00:18:38.856]  Now you have the chance to benefit in body, mind and soul with the same supplements that Andrew Tate takes himself.

[00:18:50.487 --> 00:18:59.376]  I think there's a whole bunch of men in the world who understands my value and if men grow up to be like me you're gonna have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record, dedicated athletes, who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[00:19:01.172 --> 00:19:03.054]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[00:19:03.074 --> 00:19:05.737]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[00:19:06.098 --> 00:19:11.464]  Now the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[00:19:11.884 --> 00:19:16.109]  The bad news is by Christmas almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[00:19:16.389 --> 00:19:18.110]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:22.672]  So now is the time to take action to support the Info War and get the biggest sales of the year.
[00:19:22.892 --> 00:19:28.575]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and BioTruth Selenium and our Wake Up America award-winning coffee.
[00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:33.017]  And now, DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:19:34.037 --> 00:19:39.160]  So many other great products like Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Finish Oil, Vaz-O-Beats, Secret 12.
[00:19:39.881 --> 00:19:43.783]  They are all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[00:19:44.183 --> 00:19:46.384]  Again, more stuff's going to sell out today.
[00:19:46.764 --> 00:19:50.547]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at mfullworldstore.com.
[00:19:51.127 --> 00:19:57.611]  Promo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at mfullworldstore.com.
[00:19:57.851 --> 00:19:58.951]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:19:59.152 --> 00:19:59.552]  God bless.
[00:20:01.769 --> 00:20:08.769]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.769 --> 00:20:22.448]   Look, Steve Quayle here on the Alex Jones Show on this November 16th Wednesday broadcast.
[00:20:23.314 --> 00:20:25.816]  He's not here for praise.
[00:20:25.856 --> 00:20:26.596]  He doesn't care about that.
[00:20:26.616 --> 00:20:35.422]  But it's very important to note that this guy is the trailblazer of trailblazers that predicted before anybody else exactly what we're now living through.
[00:20:35.442 --> 00:20:38.799]   A man way before It's time.
[00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:39.840]  A man in the wilderness.
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.761]  So I want to get into FTX.
[00:20:41.841 --> 00:20:43.282]  I want to get into the war in Ukraine.
[00:20:43.302 --> 00:20:44.443]  I want to get into the missile strike.
[00:20:44.823 --> 00:20:45.824]  They admit Ukraine launched.
[00:20:45.844 --> 00:20:47.285]  The Pentagon says it's still Russia's fault.
[00:20:47.325 --> 00:20:47.965]  Incredible clip.
[00:20:48.365 --> 00:20:50.126]  I want to get into Trump vs. DeSantis.
[00:20:50.547 --> 00:20:52.108]  What you think is coming next with the Globalist.
[00:20:52.208 --> 00:20:53.849]  Obviously we don't have two years to get Trump in.
[00:20:54.349 --> 00:20:54.989]  All of it with you.
[00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.831]  You'll be 15 minutes with us in the next hour.
[00:20:57.211 --> 00:20:59.432]  Then Kate Daly takes over ahead of Owen Schroeder at 3 p.m.
[00:20:59.452 --> 00:21:00.613]  Central with the War Room.
[00:21:00.633 --> 00:21:01.774]  But you were getting into FTX.
[00:21:01.814 --> 00:21:04.876]  Take your time here because this is so big.
[00:21:05.436 --> 00:21:10.258]  Upwards of $100 billion leverage capital to Ukraine, money laundering, all of it going on.
[00:21:10.318 --> 00:21:20.001]  Money goes to Ukraine from the Treasury with Biden, comes back through FTX, the Democrats, and then Patriots online and a lot of others that were exposing FTX the last few months.
[00:21:20.121 --> 00:21:22.782]  I see this as a big victory that it's been exposed.
[00:21:23.262 --> 00:21:27.283]  They've tried to recycle it now and say, oh, we need to regulate all cryptocurrencies if it's all bad.
[00:21:27.684 --> 00:21:30.324]  No, what they did was bad, using it for money laundering, in my view.
[00:21:30.604 --> 00:21:31.865]  Steve Quayle, what's your expert view?
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:46.099]   Well, FTX is a great example of what I would call a private railroad for ill-gotten gains Grease the palms of all those that were in the money chain.
[00:21:46.199 --> 00:22:03.187]  And obviously, the poster child, this is interesting, Alex, his name is Bankman Fried, and this thing has the potential, his middle name and last name, has the potential to fry all the bankmen, just like when Bernie Madoff did what he did, he basically made off with everybody's money.
[00:22:03.267 --> 00:22:05.488]  And this is way bigger than Madoff, though, right?
[00:22:06.209 --> 00:22:07.069]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:21.155]  This is beyond huge because so many people were tied in to FTX because let's face it, most of the techno billionaires, not all, but the majority of them are, are like they have a tight communication channel.
[00:22:21.175 --> 00:22:32.280]  So they were using their holdings and FTX to leverage, you know, and when you've got a little bit of money and you can use a whole lot of leverage, you can get yourself a whole lot of money or a whole lot of trouble.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:39.248]  The true actuarial state of what FTX's meltdown means is being hush-hushed.
[00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:54.944]   And you know this, Alex, nobody is really dealing with that, because when you're dealing with the world of derivatives and what you're talking about in derivatives, Are just basically liar's paper that everybody is packaging somebody else's debt and trying to sell it.
[00:22:55.304 --> 00:22:56.204]  Clip coupons.
[00:22:56.545 --> 00:23:03.629]  And now I believe this has the potential and really to bring the whole system down.
[00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:15.227]   Because prior to FTX, and this is what's critical, Remember, the sleight of hand, the sleight of hand, the magician keeps you occupied with his left hand, does the trick with the right hand, so you don't see what's going on.
[00:23:15.687 --> 00:23:24.192]  And we're watching now the revulsion and the repelling, if you will, of the American dollar being set aside.
[00:23:24.633 --> 00:23:28.815]  And that is the absolute straw that breaks the camel's back.
[00:23:29.235 --> 00:23:35.559]   We're watching just absolute, how should I say this, Financial decimation.
[00:23:35.699 --> 00:23:37.960]  And somebody said, well, how do we pay all this money back?
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:39.120]  The point is we don't.
[00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:40.841]  The point is they don't care to.
[00:23:40.901 --> 00:23:41.782]  They know they can't.
[00:23:42.182 --> 00:23:44.403]  So now we hear about a central bank, U.S.
[00:23:44.523 --> 00:23:50.125]  Digital Bank, 12 major banks are going to give, you know, basically a programmable digital dollar.
[00:23:50.185 --> 00:23:51.446]  Who's going to trust them?
[00:23:52.066 --> 00:23:53.167]  Who's going to trust them?
[00:23:53.227 --> 00:23:53.667]  Nobody.
[00:23:54.027 --> 00:23:59.970]  And now behind the scenes, Alex, there are a lot of people making claims against their T-bills, T-bonds, U.S.
[00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:00.750]  Treasury bills.
[00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.213]  Roger Bonds and UST Notes, they want something real.
[00:24:05.514 --> 00:24:06.855]  They want commodities.
[00:24:06.915 --> 00:24:08.636]  They want farmland.
[00:24:08.676 --> 00:24:10.498]  They want our natural resources.
[00:24:10.958 --> 00:24:20.767]  But what most people can't understand is that when you see $100 billion, you brought the number up, you know, that would bring our total support for Zelensky to $100 billion.
[00:24:21.628 --> 00:24:40.763]  Can anybody put two and two together and say, and I don't believe, I believe your listeners can, our listeners can, but the bottom line is, is that where is the disconnect that we're being raped and pillaged and plundered as the American taxpayer, and they're throwing money away, and then you come to find out the whole things of Ponzi scheme.
[00:24:40.783 --> 00:25:02.115]   Now I'm being told, and this is exclusive to your podcast today, broadcast today, Is the fact that they're already setting up another vehicle, another crypto, and I call them kleptocurrency, somebody, I didn't make that name up, but Alex, we're watching the cryptocurrencies turn into kryptonite for the financial systems.
[00:25:02.796 --> 00:25:11.460]  Everybody who's cross-collateralized, AOs, BOCs, CD and EO, FG and H, and on down the line.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:15.082]  Just like the 2008 crisis, anything that this is involved in, it infects it.
[00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:18.055]  Absolutely, and that's a great word.
[00:25:18.095 --> 00:25:21.837]  This is a financial doomsday infection.
[00:25:22.397 --> 00:25:23.377]  That's a great word.
[00:25:24.238 --> 00:25:30.921]  And the financial doomsday, and I want people to understand, what happens when the world says, we don't want your dollars anymore?
[00:25:31.241 --> 00:25:33.102]  We're watching that with the BRICS Nation.
[00:25:33.122 --> 00:25:35.883]  We watched, again, we watched... No, I totally agree.
[00:25:35.903 --> 00:25:38.044]  What is your intel on what brought this down?
[00:25:38.084 --> 00:25:42.607]  Because I saw some of the other more legitimate exchanges and groups attacking FTX last year.
[00:25:43.047 --> 00:25:45.208]  It built to a crescendo of them saying it was Democrat front.
[00:25:45.848 --> 00:25:48.655]  Was it some good group striking or just the internet's common sense?
[00:25:49.056 --> 00:25:51.521]  I mean, it obviously hurts the deep state that FTX has fallen.
[00:25:51.802 --> 00:25:52.984]  Or was that part of their larger plan?
[00:25:54.561 --> 00:25:57.922]  That's part of their larger plan.
[00:25:58.363 --> 00:26:00.683]  Because again, ladies and gentlemen, remember this.
[00:26:01.044 --> 00:26:07.706]  In the crypto world, there's a lot of people that were common that got onto it and saw it in an early stage and bought into it.
[00:26:08.126 --> 00:26:11.087]  But now, remember, they don't want just something.
[00:26:11.407 --> 00:26:14.388]  To quote a Schwab, they want it all.
[00:26:14.509 --> 00:26:16.949]  They're going to own it all and you'll own nothing and be happy.
[00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:17.730]  Well, you'd be dead.
[00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:20.931]  But the point is, is that the bigger picture is this.
[00:26:21.551 --> 00:26:26.736]  And notice the ruble is the strongest currency next to the dollar in the world.
[00:26:26.556 --> 00:26:31.315]   against Russia. When President Putin, listen this is fact, when President Putin
[00:26:31.315 --> 00:26:37.956]   backed the ruble with gold he took the the infinite ability to print US
[00:26:37.956 --> 00:26:42.355]   dollars away. And notice the ruble is the strongest currency next to the dollar in
[00:26:42.355 --> 00:26:46.786]  the world. It was a weak currency previous to that one move.
[00:26:46.786 --> 00:26:48.716]  That one move.
[00:26:47.121 --> 00:27:04.327]  And then, and I want to share something, and then with the brilliance of a chess master, look, I wouldn't want to play chess against him, but the President Putin recognized one thing, that he's, and look, I'm not an apologist, okay?
[00:27:04.607 --> 00:27:11.530]  And because you tell the truth, that commodities ultimately, Alex, are the basis of all trade policy.
[00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:16.714]  Fiat stuff is only bound to real tangible energy and real products.
[00:27:17.755 --> 00:27:17.996]  Right.
[00:27:18.116 --> 00:27:21.339]  And again, you know, here's this, ladies and gentlemen, the great reset.
[00:27:21.879 --> 00:27:24.021]  Just get rid of that Bravo Sierra.
[00:27:24.322 --> 00:27:25.983]  It's the great destruction.
[00:27:26.083 --> 00:27:29.006]  It's the total destruction of nation states.
[00:27:29.026 --> 00:27:33.751]  Because again, I want to say this, Alex, COP 27 in Egypt, people don't understand this.
[00:27:34.131 --> 00:27:43.941]  But they rewrote the Ten Commandments and evidently, you know, they thought they could do a better job than God, making literally the creation their God, worshiping the creation.
[00:27:43.961 --> 00:27:49.867]  But in the meantime, they're doing stuff behind the sight of the common man.
[00:27:50.107 --> 00:27:52.009]  By the way, 400 private jets.
[00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:56.113]  You know, 400 private jets going to Mount Sinai.
[00:27:56.133 --> 00:27:58.376]  By the way, the one they went to wasn't the real one.
[00:27:58.396 --> 00:28:01.600]  The real Mount Sinai is in Saudi Arabia.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:15.288]   But where they went to have their meeting, Alex, I'm being told, I don't think anybody said this publicly, but I'm being told by people that know that interface of that world that they've already decided who
[00:28:15.288 --> 00:28:17.209]  the coming world leader is.
[00:28:17.209 --> 00:28:22.169]   And they kept him hidden, but this is the same guy that Prince Charles, now King Charles,
[00:28:22.169 --> 00:28:29.127]   referred to at that global summit. So, ladies and gentlemen, all of this politicus distracticus.
[00:28:29.127 --> 00:28:33.607]   And I want to say something. Isn't that the definition of insanity? And Alex, I don't know
[00:28:33.607 --> 00:28:40.088]   if you've addressed it, but how is it that people think that elections in the midterms would not be
[00:28:40.088 --> 00:28:45.088]  stolen like they were in the presidential race.
[00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:47.092]  And how is it that we're going to see any change?
[00:28:47.152 --> 00:28:49.634]  And now I hear a same mind control.
[00:28:49.654 --> 00:28:50.835]  Hold on, stay there, stay there.
[00:28:50.875 --> 00:28:52.016]  You brought up the event.
[00:28:52.336 --> 00:28:54.298]  They called for world government, global currency.
[00:28:54.658 --> 00:28:59.302]  We'll get to Russia, we'll get to the Mark of the Beast, the Antichrist, straight ahead with Steve Powell.

[00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:31.002]  Oh, really?

[00:31:00.615 --> 00:31:10.303]  Communication and and again the communication the ability to communicate but the ability to get you the latest Information on what just happened.
[00:31:10.563 --> 00:31:17.043]   Let's say a new, when it goes off, goes off there, we'll know it, those of us who are able to communicate,
[00:31:17.043 --> 00:31:23.723]   but in essence, you're watching the destruction and the desire to have total control over all information,
[00:31:23.723 --> 00:31:27.483]  total information, awareness, and total information control.
[00:31:27.483 --> 00:31:35.643]   The satellite phone and the bivy stick are the only way that you can stay certain of being able to access
[00:31:35.643 --> 00:31:38.883]  different communication people that will have these.
[00:31:38.887 --> 00:31:41.248]  A lot of hams are getting the bivy stick.
[00:31:41.288 --> 00:31:42.930]  A lot of hams are getting satellite phones.
[00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:59.322]  So it's always important for people to understand, once you begin to lose it up here, and you start to worry and fret, and it's the mindset of knowing what's going on takes away from the uncertainty that initiates panic.
[00:31:59.842 --> 00:32:01.123]  That's a powerful statement.
[00:32:01.243 --> 00:32:01.663]  Absolutely.
[00:32:01.683 --> 00:32:03.064]  People should go to InfoWarsPhone.com.
[00:32:03.084 --> 00:32:07.846]  That takes you to the big satellite store, and we get the sponsorship and the credit, so it's a win-win for all of us.
[00:32:08.347 --> 00:32:09.607]  Stay on air, plus you get ready.

[00:32:13.946 --> 00:32:18.306]   whatever you choose, but you simply pay for the monthly subscription and again

[00:32:21.346 --> 00:32:29.547]   monthly deal on. You can also call 941-955-1020, 941-955-1020, 941-955-1020

[00:32:34.429 --> 00:32:34.469]  941-955-1020.
[00:32:34.509 --> 00:32:36.069]  But this is one of the no-brainers.
[00:32:36.129 --> 00:32:40.470]  You need a gun, you need storable food, you need a relationship with God, you need water filtration, you need friends and family.
[00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:41.371]  That's all the best things.
[00:32:41.531 --> 00:32:44.231]  And you need a bivvy stick or a satellite phone right now.
[00:32:44.251 --> 00:32:45.512]  Infowarsphone.com.
[00:32:45.572 --> 00:32:47.772]  I mean, this is insurance everybody needs to have right now.
[00:32:47.792 --> 00:32:49.653]  People need to get it, they need to learn how to use it.
[00:32:49.693 --> 00:32:50.353]  It's very easy.
[00:32:50.753 --> 00:32:51.193]  I use it.
[00:32:51.213 --> 00:32:52.774]  I've got them at my house, I've got them at the office.
[00:32:52.834 --> 00:32:54.834]  This is critical.
[00:32:54.834 --> 00:32:58.834]  [Explosion]
[00:32:58.834 --> 00:33:02.834]  [Music]
[00:33:02.834 --> 00:33:06.834]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order is...
[00:33:07.312 --> 00:33:09.012]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.012 --> 00:33:16.012]  I've got a tiger by the tail to explain the scene.
[00:33:16.012 --> 00:33:24.011]  I won't be much when you get through with me.
[00:33:24.753 --> 00:33:26.874]  He never gives up.
[00:33:27.014 --> 00:33:33.378]  He's Alex Jones, broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas, worldwide.
[00:33:33.438 --> 00:33:39.722]  Well, in the case of Steve Quayle, he got a lion by the tail.
[00:33:39.762 --> 00:33:52.585]   He was getting into the whole global attack, the world government being announced, and so at the big UN event that's just now ending with 400 jets and all the new world order there.
[00:33:52.986 --> 00:33:57.427]  Say you can't have food or water, you'll own nothing, you'll have nothing, you'll be dead, you'll love it.
[00:33:58.808 --> 00:34:00.988]  They are again announcing what's already being set up.
[00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:04.750]  G20 to adopt vaccine passports using WHO standards.
[00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:08.831]  Let's have a digital health certificate acknowledged by the World Health Organization under the UN.
[00:34:09.231 --> 00:34:12.833]  You've been vaccinated or tested properly, then you can move around.
[00:34:13.573 --> 00:34:15.454]  This is their holy grail, the mark of the beast.
[00:34:15.734 --> 00:34:16.114]  Here it is.
[00:34:18.752 --> 00:34:24.172]  So let's have a digital health certificate acknowledged by WHO.
[00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:30.351]  If you have been vaccinated or tested properly, then you can move around.
[00:34:31.151 --> 00:34:42.834]  So for the next pandemic, instead of stopping the movement of the people 100%, which clogged the economy globally, you know, you can still provide some movement of the people.
[00:34:43.194 --> 00:34:59.597]   Indonesia has achieved, G20 country has agreed to have this digital certificate using WHO standard, and we will submit into the next The World Health Assembly in Geneva has the revision to international health regulation.
[00:34:59.917 --> 00:35:08.100]  So hopefully for the next pandemic, we can still see some movement of the people, some movement of the goods, and movement of the economy.
[00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:14.561]  So they hold you hostage with a shot that makes you sick and doesn't work, and say next time we'll just give you a passport and make sure you take it.
[00:35:15.001 --> 00:35:16.802]  Steve Quayle, that's exactly what you were getting at.
[00:35:16.842 --> 00:35:17.422]  Please continue.
[00:35:18.672 --> 00:35:21.817]  Well, first of all, they want to control all travel.
[00:35:22.237 --> 00:35:26.303]  They want to control all, all issues of your life.
[00:35:26.804 --> 00:35:33.393]  And that doesn't get any more provocative and clearer than the gentleman making that statement.
[00:35:33.453 --> 00:35:34.555]  And I got to tell you something.
[00:35:35.075 --> 00:35:38.678]  And again, ladies and gentlemen, they've taken away everything.
[00:35:38.718 --> 00:35:43.161]  The United States we once had, pre-lockdown, no longer exists.
[00:35:43.201 --> 00:35:44.442]  There's nothing in the food chain.
[00:35:44.462 --> 00:35:49.526]  But getting back to his idea, a global ID is the mark of the beast.
[00:35:49.626 --> 00:35:51.548]  It's right out of the Book of Revelation.
[00:35:51.968 --> 00:35:54.070]  People can say, I don't believe all that stuff.
[00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:58.053]  Yeah, well, you just had the most powerful Luciferians.
[00:35:59.071 --> 00:36:08.559]  In Egypt, telling, in essence, we're going to write the Ten Commandments because you're going to be a god, and that's the same lie that was told to Adam and Eve in the garden.
[00:36:08.579 --> 00:36:13.843]  But going further than that, they have a plan, and it doesn't include most.
[00:36:13.963 --> 00:36:15.685]  All they want is worker bees.
[00:36:16.105 --> 00:36:31.336]  Because when you're talking about killing off 95% of the world's population, remember, King Charles' father, Prince Philip, was on record as saying he wanted to come back as a virus to destroy a world's population, talking about reincarnation.
[00:36:31.896 --> 00:36:33.318]  Well, Alex, you know this.
[00:36:33.338 --> 00:36:34.339]  They're going to vaccinate.
[00:36:34.359 --> 00:36:35.641]  They're going to assassinate.
[00:36:35.661 --> 00:36:36.862]  They're going to continue on.
[00:36:36.882 --> 00:36:38.504]  And right now, the story is breaking.
[00:36:38.845 --> 00:36:41.748]  That Ebola is breaking out in Uganda.
[00:36:41.808 --> 00:36:43.390]  Now Tanzania is shutting down.
[00:36:43.730 --> 00:36:44.411]  And the U.S.
[00:36:44.611 --> 00:36:48.436]  is preparing plans for Ebola.
[00:36:48.476 --> 00:36:58.347]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, Years ago, decades ago, the whole idea of Ebola being cultivated, it was actually portrayed in the movie.
[00:36:58.407 --> 00:36:59.608]  I want people to understand this.
[00:36:59.968 --> 00:37:08.298]  Hollywood again telegraphed in the movie Outbreak, with Dustin Hoffman and Rene Russo, the shenanigans that go on in the bioweaponry.
[00:37:08.418 --> 00:37:20.745]   And for the record, Alex, One of the biggest cover-ups in history are the U.S.-funded biolabs that are not only race-specific, not only haplogroup, genotype-specific, but individual-specific.
[00:37:20.765 --> 00:37:30.309]  In other words, bioweapons have redefined, they've gone from a shotgun... And you've been saying that for 25 years, and now it's the source of James Bond movies, but it's in the news, it's real.
[00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:32.290]  It's in the news, it's real.
[00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:35.872]  So what is... I think that people have to understand something.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:40.021]  They have to get involved with their own desire to live.
[00:37:40.041 --> 00:37:52.145]  You know, you've spent your life, I've spent my life, the majority of it, trying to warn people, but the toughest thing is, is that when people choose that, well, it'll just get better, we'll just vote the right man in.
[00:37:52.525 --> 00:38:00.188]  You've got to, what you're saying is key, find your life force, find your connection to God, realize you're under attack, it's biblical, it's real, and you're in a war.
[00:38:00.368 --> 00:38:01.068]  Realize you're in a war.
[00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:07.863]  Realize we're in a war, but again, people think it's only fought with guns and bullets and bioweapons and nuclear weapons and all that.
[00:38:08.324 --> 00:38:11.426]  But there is an insidious control.
[00:38:11.486 --> 00:38:13.848]  This is the question I get asked more than any other one.
[00:38:14.328 --> 00:38:18.291]  How is it that the whole world goes into lockdown at the same point?
[00:38:18.351 --> 00:38:21.434]  How is it that the economy is shut down at the same point?
[00:38:21.734 --> 00:38:23.375]  And the answer to that is simple.
[00:38:23.775 --> 00:38:24.316]  Lucifer.
[00:38:24.916 --> 00:38:28.017]  This is a world government test of power.
[00:38:28.077 --> 00:38:29.777]  So it's not just info wars.
[00:38:29.837 --> 00:38:30.878]  It's not just money wars.
[00:38:31.258 --> 00:38:32.418]  The key is spirit wars.
[00:38:33.378 --> 00:38:34.258]  It is spirit wars.
[00:38:34.338 --> 00:38:47.682]  And again, you know, people are having all types of interactions with cryptids, strange creatures, everything from incubus, succubus, all kinds of the veils being rent, Alex.
[00:38:48.062 --> 00:38:59.546]   And again, Hollywood Prep people, and when you've made this bizarre world, not you, but they have made this bizarre world where they told you in advance what they're getting ready to do.
[00:38:59.946 --> 00:39:04.288]  And ladies and gentlemen, there's one goal, and this is one goal only, and it's interesting.
[00:39:04.568 --> 00:39:06.629]  Both Lucifer and all of his minions share it.
[00:39:06.869 --> 00:39:08.870]  The complete destruction of the human race.
[00:39:09.310 --> 00:39:17.434]  When you, Alex, and I started walking and talking about transhumanism, most people thought that was a movie that came out at the same time as Transformers.
[00:39:18.081 --> 00:39:38.394]  No, the title was really provocative, but what we're watching now is every area of the planet, in political, religious, sociological, and the scientific world, converging to control all narratives so that the word truth never exists.
[00:39:38.454 --> 00:39:40.195]  And I remember when I first met... Let's expand on that.
[00:39:40.235 --> 00:39:41.156]  We've got to go back.
[00:39:41.296 --> 00:39:42.557]  I've got archives, but...
[00:39:43.379 --> 00:39:44.379]  They only go back 15 years.
[00:39:44.419 --> 00:39:52.703]  If you've got archives of you 25, 30 years ago, everything you said, because you were my guest frequently, literally now happened.
[00:39:53.143 --> 00:39:56.445]  So people think Alex Jones stuff's incredible 20 years ago coming true.
[00:39:56.785 --> 00:40:08.430]  We've got to find, I know it's in your books, but we've got to find, or maybe you can highlight your books, I've got them around here somewhere, and come on about it because people really pay attention to something 20, 30 years ahead.
[00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:09.871]  I mean, you laid this out.
[00:40:12.065 --> 00:40:19.850]  Well, again, we're at right now, ladies and gentlemen, it's not a... just a... what's the word I want?
[00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:23.032]  We're not just trying to tell people that, oh, in the future it's going to be bad.
[00:40:23.332 --> 00:40:25.333]  Everything that we warned about is now.
[00:40:25.433 --> 00:40:26.654]  It's not future-oriented.
[00:40:26.774 --> 00:40:27.395]  It's now.
[00:40:27.975 --> 00:40:37.121]  Importing 11 million people because our birth rates are down by the very people that introduce xenoestrogens into the drinking water.
[00:40:37.281 --> 00:41:00.488]   American males have been, in essence, Chemically castrated, lowest sperm count, but everything, injecting children with the vaccination from hell, all of this stuff, 15 people at the Center for Disease Creation, and that's what it's been, I've never called it anything else, in my opinion, but all of them vote to vaccinate, you know, infants, what, six months on.
[00:41:00.508 --> 00:41:12.914]   I don't think that the ability of people to put cause and effect into the same sentence or thought process This is genocide, this is depopulation, this is forced euthanasia.
[00:41:13.234 --> 00:41:14.815]  We're not invaded, we're not operational.
[00:41:15.115 --> 00:41:23.382]  We're going to come back and talk about some key ways to protect ourselves and get into what's coming next and the Russia situation and then blaming the missile attack on Russia even though they admit Russia didn't do it.
[00:41:24.343 --> 00:41:27.626]  But Steve, at the end of the day, lead us in a minute of prayer before we go to break.
[00:41:28.166 --> 00:41:31.629]  Because you don't do this a lot, but lead us in a minute of prayer because God's the answer.
[00:41:33.464 --> 00:41:37.769]  Well, Lord, I ask that you've given Alex the platform, you've given me the platform.
[00:41:38.129 --> 00:41:45.558]  I pray you take the veil and the scales off people's eyes and hearts, even those who are agnostic, even those who are atheistic.
[00:41:46.118 --> 00:41:47.480]  God, this is the time.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:53.787]  This is the time your Bible has declared your word, Lord, that it would be in the end times, in that period.
[00:41:55.167 --> 00:41:59.649]  Just that's presenting itself now, Lord, prior to the second coming of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:59.669 --> 00:42:01.130]  Lord, I ask your protection over Alex.
[00:42:01.410 --> 00:42:05.252]  I ask your protection over all InfoWarriors, the people that are hungry for the truth.
[00:42:05.876 --> 00:42:09.419]  They cannot get away from the fact, Jesus, you are the truth, the way, and the life.
[00:42:09.719 --> 00:42:28.876]  And Lord, I pray for your protection over every single one of the listeners and viewers and those who are fighting for freedom, because God, you are the ultimate source of freedom, you are the ultimate source of liberty, and God, you are the ultimate protection, because outside of you, Lord, we can only do what we can do, but you can do the impossible.
[00:42:29.296 --> 00:42:43.165]  Thank you, God, for this opportunity to pray and believe for a miracle, Lord, in turning this whole situation around, not only with Alex, but, Lord, for exposing all the evil, and then people can see the choices they have to make.
[00:42:44.546 --> 00:42:45.206]  I'm into that.
[00:42:45.226 --> 00:42:46.187]  All right, we're going to come back.
[00:42:46.287 --> 00:42:47.607]  We're doing 50 minutes to the next hour.
[00:42:48.148 --> 00:42:49.008]  Kate Daly takes over.
[00:42:49.028 --> 00:42:49.469]  We'll jam in.
[00:42:49.489 --> 00:42:52.150]  Jefferson and Eric have been holding patiently as well.
[00:42:52.911 --> 00:42:54.232]  This is such an insane time.
[00:42:54.252 --> 00:42:56.173]  We're going to look at Russia that we talked about up front.
[00:42:56.784 --> 00:42:59.745]  The insanity of blaming Russia for an attack to admit Ukraine launched.
[00:43:00.406 --> 00:43:02.827]  Let's see what's cooking on TV.
[00:43:02.867 --> 00:43:03.967]  Thanksgiving Day is coming.
[00:43:04.308 --> 00:43:09.010]  And for Charlie Brown, that can only mean... It's a Charlie Brown Thanksgiving.
[00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:13.172]  I'll tell you, Pat, this stuff is looking good, and smelling good, and tasting good.
[00:43:13.452 --> 00:43:15.333]  We gotta dig in and start eating now.
[00:43:16.833 --> 00:43:18.654]  Oh, girl, what a feast this is!
[00:43:18.494 --> 00:43:20.494]  This is beautiful, girl!
[00:43:20.494 --> 00:43:22.494]  Congratulations! Congratulations!
[00:43:22.494 --> 00:43:24.494]  I said nice!
[00:43:24.494 --> 00:43:26.494]  What the turkey?
[00:43:26.342 --> 00:43:26.782]  Watch it.
[00:43:26.622 --> 00:43:29.622]  (audience laughing)
[00:43:29.622 --> 00:43:39.862]  Give me that!
[00:43:39.862 --> 00:43:40.702]  Hey!
[00:43:40.702 --> 00:43:43.702]  (audience laughing)
[00:43:43.702 --> 00:43:52.542]   The turkeys are hitting the ground like sands of wet cement.
[00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:53.542]  [applause]
[00:43:53.654 --> 00:43:57.898]  I don't know how much longer the crowd is running for their lives.
[00:43:57.998 --> 00:44:00.401]  Thanks for that on-the-spot report, Lance.
[00:44:00.901 --> 00:44:08.609]  For those of you who just tuned in, the Pinedale Shopping Mall has just been bombed with live turkeys.
[00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:10.131]  Film at 11.
[00:44:10.331 --> 00:44:11.593]  Hey, buddy.
[00:44:14.850 --> 00:44:17.431]  Don't let him kill me!
[00:44:17.571 --> 00:44:21.092]  I'm too young to die!
[00:44:20.972 --> 00:44:27.972]   you want at Alice's Restaurant. You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant. Don't
[00:44:27.972 --> 00:44:38.452]   let him kill me! I'm too young to die! Look, I had a chance to shoot a bunch of you the
[00:44:38.452 --> 00:44:45.452]   other day and didn't. He wants to get rid of Thanksgiving forever!
[00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:47.804]  To get rid of the Thanksgiving Day Parade!
[00:44:48.064 --> 00:44:49.365]  All right, Spider-Man!
[00:44:49.545 --> 00:44:56.391]  He's got spiderweb rays coming out of his hands, he can cling to tall buildings, and he's looking for Octopus, the Green Goblin!
[00:44:56.632 --> 00:44:57.732]  Ranjit O.J., O.J.
[00:44:57.793 --> 00:45:00.815]  running to the left, turns the corner at the 30, O.J.
[00:45:00.875 --> 00:45:02.256]  at the 25, the 20, and falls ahead of the 15!
[00:45:02.316 --> 00:45:04.058]  That does it, he broke the record!
[00:45:04.198 --> 00:45:10.082]  For Quentin Longley, even if he never completes another pass, they'll always remember the one he threw on Thanksgiving Day 1974.
[00:45:11.743 --> 00:45:13.124]  Where's the turkey, Chuck?
[00:45:13.364 --> 00:45:15.786]  Don't you know anything about Thanksgiving dinners?
[00:45:18.347 --> 00:45:19.628]  Those aren't pillows!
[00:45:19.628 --> 00:45:21.628]  [Screaming]
[00:45:21.628 --> 00:45:23.628]  No! No!
[00:45:23.628 --> 00:45:25.628]  [Crying]
[00:45:25.628 --> 00:45:29.626]  As God is my witness, I thought turkeys could fly.
[00:45:29.626 --> 00:45:31.628]  [Laughter]
[00:45:31.628 --> 00:45:33.628]  [Applause]
[00:45:33.628 --> 00:45:39.628]  [Music]
[00:45:39.665 --> 00:45:52.509]  Tonight, on this Thanksgiving, I come before you to ask your help, to ask your strength, to ask your prayer.
[00:45:53.430 --> 00:46:04.167]   All of us have lived through seven days that none of us We don't just have up to 60% off of promo code 1776, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:46:45.677 --> 00:46:49.038]   So this is undoubtedly now officially the biggest sell we've ever done.
[00:46:49.038 --> 00:46:53.677]   Up to 60% off promo code 1776, total liquidation blowout to fund us into the new year

[00:46:55.597 --> 00:46:56.938]  Free gifts in every order.
[00:46:56.938 --> 00:47:06.478]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:47:06.478 --> 00:47:08.278]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.278 --> 00:47:10.858]  (upbeat music)
[00:47:10.858 --> 00:47:26.597]   ♪ A Monday worry of mean, mean stride ♪ ♪ Today's Tom Sawyer mean, mean pride ♪
[00:47:26.597 --> 00:47:31.619]   Well, the one, the only Steve Quayle's our guest here on the Alex Jones Show going into second hour.
[00:47:31.365 --> 00:47:39.268]  But it was Steve Quayle a few years ago got me in touch with some really amazing people that have the highest quality, lowest price you're going to find anywhere.
[00:47:39.288 --> 00:47:42.070]  High quality satellite phones.
[00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:44.951]  But they've got satellite phones available right now for a limited time.
[00:47:45.291 --> 00:47:46.151]  They're sold everywhere else.
[00:47:46.511 --> 00:47:52.475]   But they've also got this dongle that plugs into a regular cell phone but
[00:47:52.475 --> 00:47:57.006]   protects where you're at, isn't satellite tracked, isn't cell tower tracked, and you can send text
[00:47:57.006 --> 00:48:01.366]   messages with it unlimited. So Steve, you're really the expert on this, you've been harping on
[00:48:01.366 --> 00:48:05.595]   this, but with all the craziness going on, they're not just obsessed with shutting down thought
[00:48:05.595 --> 00:48:11.116]   leaders like myself and Tucker Carlson and you and many others, they're obsessed with the average
[00:48:11.116 --> 00:48:13.586]  person not being able to communicate.
[00:48:13.586 --> 00:48:19.345]   So the crazy times that are coming, the number one insurance policy obviously is to have a
[00:48:19.345 --> 00:48:26.386]   relationship with God, have verbal food, water, friends you can trust, self-defense, and communications.
[00:48:26.654 --> 00:48:33.720]  And so, this system with the dongle from InfoWarsPhone.com, that just takes you to the biggest company, patriot company here in the U.S.
[00:48:35.114 --> 00:48:39.117]  You can get your free iSat2 satellite phone.
[00:48:39.157 --> 00:48:40.778]  All you do is pay for the minutes.
[00:48:40.858 --> 00:48:46.002]  They also have the bivy stick dongle that turns any cell phone into a satellite phone.
[00:48:46.763 --> 00:48:49.305]  Just amazing systems at InfoWarsPhone.com.
[00:48:49.645 --> 00:48:57.311]  I want to get back into Russia and the war and the missile and the Pentagon saying, yeah, Ukraine launched it, but it's really Russia's fault and we're all that's going with you.
[00:48:57.331 --> 00:49:03.716]  But spend some time, because you're really the guy that's been the expert on this, about these amazing products at InfoWarsPhone.com.
[00:49:04.952 --> 00:49:10.834]  Well, first of all, we're watching what happened to Florida on two occasions where the power went out.
[00:49:11.194 --> 00:49:15.636]  We're watching the communications realm be interfered with all over the planet.
[00:49:15.676 --> 00:49:18.957]  Cyberattacks, even last night, there were multiple cyberattacks.
[00:49:18.997 --> 00:49:28.060]  The neat thing about the bivy stick and the satellite phones is you're not dependent upon land-based uplinks or downlinks.
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.361]  You can go satellite to satellite.
[00:49:29.381 --> 00:49:34.004]   For instance, Alex, You just put up the image of the bivy stick.
[00:49:34.384 --> 00:49:52.698]  When things go just all the way down the tube, thank you, I can communicate with you through bivy stick to the satellite and the only thing your cell phone does is it becomes the transmitting type, you're putting your information, data input and data reception.
[00:49:53.178 --> 00:49:55.399]  But you're not linked to the cell phone towers.
[00:49:55.419 --> 00:49:57.781]  You're not linked to global power grids.
[00:49:58.241 --> 00:49:59.982]  So this is one of the most critical devices.
[00:50:00.002 --> 00:50:05.786]  And I think the satellite phone store has just knocked it out of the ballpark in three ballparks.
[00:50:05.846 --> 00:50:12.009]  Because in essence, they give you the baby stick, the phone, and you know, you have to sign up for a monthly deal.
[00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:13.370]  And I know the owners.
[00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:17.012]  I've known the owners of this company for 10 years, maybe longer than that now.
[00:50:17.513 --> 00:50:28.319]   And it's the most reasonably priced two-way communication device That isn't dependent upon any power that's going to be present or not present.
[00:50:28.539 --> 00:50:35.203]  And I mean, here's a quick analogy because they've got amazing, very inexpensive, high quality solar little panel handheld systems.
[00:50:35.564 --> 00:50:36.684]  So you're totally off the grid.
[00:50:36.704 --> 00:50:37.685]  They've got great batteries.
[00:50:37.725 --> 00:50:39.066]  They've got hundreds of great products.
[00:50:39.306 --> 00:50:40.767]  They supply the Border Patrol, you name it.
[00:50:41.027 --> 00:50:43.468]  But my analogy is remember old fashioned TV.
[00:50:43.528 --> 00:50:44.229]  You watched it.
[00:50:44.649 --> 00:50:45.370]  It didn't watch you.
[00:50:45.430 --> 00:50:47.451]  You picked up a transmission.
[00:50:47.891 --> 00:50:48.912]  It's the same thing with these.
[00:50:49.252 --> 00:50:51.213]  You're communicating, but they're not tracking you.
[00:50:51.254 --> 00:50:52.354]  This is really great.
[00:50:53.735 --> 00:50:56.157]  Well, and communication's the number one thing.
[00:50:56.577 --> 00:51:01.301]  Keeping our brains focused, and when you can communicate and get information.
[00:51:01.341 --> 00:51:05.043]  Listen, ladies and gentlemen, the biggest trafficking in the world is private data.
[00:51:05.103 --> 00:51:08.626]  Data trafficking, everybody's selling everybody's data.
[00:51:09.046 --> 00:51:12.068]  And imagine they've telegraphed the World Economic Forum.
[00:51:12.108 --> 00:51:15.130]  The next thing is a cyber shutdown that they'll obviously launch.
[00:51:15.451 --> 00:51:16.912]  Blame on some group of the Russians.
[00:51:18.767 --> 00:51:21.449]  Imagine with no real communication how much they can control us.
[00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:23.891]  Right, and that's the key.
[00:51:24.731 --> 00:51:27.654]  If you cut off communications, this is a military maneuver.
[00:51:29.335 --> 00:51:30.956]  Control, command and communication.
[00:51:31.236 --> 00:51:38.361]  We're watching this going on and hearing bits and pieces of it over in the Ukraine, in the atmosphere.
[00:51:38.381 --> 00:51:46.227]  When you lose the theater of war, when you lose your ability to communicate, your brain starts to play games on you.
[00:51:46.767 --> 00:51:48.688]  So that what's neat about the baby stick.
[00:51:48.728 --> 00:51:59.370]  And if you your friends, you can you can receive messages from your friends and the satellite phone source is ready to basically get these into everyone's hands.
[00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:06.732]  And they love and by the way, the owner of it loves the ability to be able to get people to stay in communication.
[00:52:06.852 --> 00:52:11.553]  You know, this is a neat thing you talked about to solar panels.
[00:52:11.973 --> 00:52:29.165]   They make the neatest solar power generators that you can charge your Maybe stick or your satellite phone with and it's it's the most self-contained and people and I want to say this people don't understand what it's like to go without any type of communication.
[00:52:29.485 --> 00:52:34.730]  I mean, I go crazy when I don't have the internet to go on and get my communications emails and stuff.
[00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:38.653]  So everybody needs to have an alternative form of communication.
[00:52:39.013 --> 00:52:45.357]  That is not dependent on the power grid or the whims of those who can track you.
[00:52:45.377 --> 00:52:54.403]  By the way, everybody that got arrested on the January 6th, you know, fiasco, they were all placed in proximity by the tracking of their cell phones.
[00:52:54.443 --> 00:52:55.764]  That's right, so let's expand on this.
[00:52:55.804 --> 00:52:59.667]  This plugs into a regular cell phone that gives you satellite communications that aren't tracked.
[00:53:00.527 --> 00:53:06.791]  The level of this is so important, and they're pre-telegraphing that they're going to have cyber attacks and shut down communications.
[00:53:07.351 --> 00:53:09.292]  Gut level, what's the time frame?
[00:53:09.612 --> 00:53:10.633]  How bad do you think it'll be?
[00:53:10.673 --> 00:53:14.175]  I know we don't obviously know what their exact plan is, but they've telegraphed they're about to do it.
[00:53:14.275 --> 00:53:16.476]  I mean, this is insurance everybody needs to have right now.
[00:53:16.496 --> 00:53:17.357]  People need to get it.
[00:53:17.377 --> 00:53:18.378]  They need to learn how to use it.
[00:53:18.398 --> 00:53:19.078]  It's very easy.
[00:53:19.458 --> 00:53:19.898]  I use it.
[00:53:19.918 --> 00:53:20.739]  I've got it at my house.
[00:53:20.759 --> 00:53:21.479]  I've got it at the office.
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:22.300]  This is critical.
[00:53:23.706 --> 00:53:32.574]  Well, I think that we're already seeing its value right now, because especially when Florida had the problems they had with the hurricane.
[00:53:32.614 --> 00:53:37.279]  By the way, that was weather warfare against Florida, both on the East Coast and West Coast.
[00:53:37.399 --> 00:53:38.840]  West Coast first, East Coast now.
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:44.645]  And what I think that most people are lacking is this, Alex, communication.
[00:53:45.146 --> 00:53:53.213]   And again, the communication, the ability to communicate, but the ability to Get you the latest information on what just happened.
[00:53:53.473 --> 00:53:59.518]  Let's say a nuke, when it goes off, goes off there, we'll know it, those of us who are able to communicate.
[00:53:59.958 --> 00:54:10.086]  But in essence, you're watching the destruction and the desire to have total control over all information, total information awareness and total information control.
[00:54:10.407 --> 00:54:21.754]   The satellite phone and the bivy stick are the only way that you can stay certain of being able to access Different communication people that will have these.
[00:54:21.834 --> 00:54:24.175]  A lot of hams are getting the baby stick.
[00:54:24.195 --> 00:54:25.876]  A lot of hams are getting satellite phones.
[00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:29.258]  So it's always important for people to understand.
[00:54:29.918 --> 00:54:42.243]  Once you begin to lose it up here and you start to worry and fret and it's the mindset of knowing what's going on takes away from the uncertainty that initiates panic.
[00:54:42.723 --> 00:54:44.103]  And that's a powerful statement.
[00:54:44.163 --> 00:54:44.603]  Absolutely.
[00:54:44.623 --> 00:54:46.464]  People should go to InfoWarsPhone.com.
[00:54:46.484 --> 00:54:52.545]  That takes you to the big satellite store, and we get the sponsorship and the credit, so it's a win-win for all of us to stay on air, plus you get ready.
[00:54:52.905 --> 00:55:02.587]  InfoWarsPhone.com, and you get the free satellite phone, the free bivy stick, whatever you choose, but you simply pay for the monthly subscription.
[00:55:03.027 --> 00:55:04.927]  And again, calls to your sat phone are free.
[00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:07.368]  It's the calls you use that you get the monthly deal on.
[00:55:07.728 --> 00:55:18.447]   You can also call 941-955-1020, 941-955-1020, 941-955-1020, and also talk to the great operators.
[00:55:18.447 --> 00:55:22.246]  They can answer all your questions, 941-955-1020.
[00:55:22.246 --> 00:55:24.447]  But this is one of the no-brainers.
[00:55:24.447 --> 00:55:27.246]   You need a gun, you need storable food, you need a relationship with God,
[00:55:27.246 --> 00:55:30.048]   you need water filtration, you need friends and family, that's all the best things,
[00:55:30.048 --> 00:55:34.567]   and you need a baby stick or a satellite phone right now, InfoWarsPhone.com.
[00:55:34.567 --> 00:55:36.528]  Steve, just final comments on this.
[00:55:36.528 --> 00:55:40.887]   I wanna come back and get into Russia and the missile and where you see all that going.
[00:55:40.887 --> 00:55:49.728]   Well, first of all, again, as we're talking right now, we are seeing things that are absolutely off the charts
[00:55:49.728 --> 00:55:52.528]  when it comes to attacks, cyber attacks.
[00:55:52.769 --> 00:55:55.771]  There is no secure databank, FTX, OK?
[00:55:56.111 --> 00:55:56.811]  Cryptocurrencies.
[00:55:56.851 --> 00:56:01.114]  Those of you who have cryptocurrencies, you want to be able to access your wallets.
[00:56:01.774 --> 00:56:08.380]  And you want to be able to have a form of communication, and you've got to be able to know what's going on in one part of the world.
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:13.504]  So there's only one answer, and that is the satellite phone or the bivy stick.
[00:56:13.545 --> 00:56:17.388]  The bivy stick has greater freedom in that it's just text.
[00:56:17.428 --> 00:56:18.509]  You don't get pretty pictures.
[00:56:18.869 --> 00:56:29.860]  But Alex, you can go up to a thousand characters, and quite candidly, it's just like going back to the old bulletin board system of when the computers, you know, two-way communication between computers came out.
[00:56:30.221 --> 00:56:32.063]  So ladies and gentlemen, this is the sat...
[00:56:32.737 --> 00:56:45.645]  Satellite answer and the bivy stick answer to go satellite to satellite, person to person, and completely avoid the necessity for ground-based cell towers or also power stations when the power goes out.
[00:56:46.246 --> 00:56:51.469]  InfoWarsPhone.com takes you to the satellite store and then it helps the broadcast.
[00:56:51.509 --> 00:56:53.591]  But folks, this is something everybody needs.
[00:56:53.831 --> 00:56:55.312]  InfoWarsPhone.com or 941-955-1020.
[00:56:55.331 --> 00:57:04.770]   or 941-955-1020, satellitephonestore.com, satellitephonestore.com will also take you there.
[00:57:04.770 --> 00:57:07.891]   Now I want to get into Russia and the missile and the insane statements by the Pentagon.
[00:57:07.891 --> 00:57:09.811]  We come back, we got 30 seconds to break.
[00:57:09.811 --> 00:57:12.331]  What else do you want to hit when we come back, Steve Quayle?
[00:57:12.331 --> 00:57:15.571]   Well, right now I think people have got to watch the extreme weather warfare.
[00:57:15.482 --> 00:57:30.147]  And I want to tell everybody, I think one of the most important things for you to watch, and it's going to affect communication, is the amount of reverberation of all the weather modification and control weaponry being used by multiple countries against each other.
[00:57:30.607 --> 00:57:33.608]  And we're watching it, and it's only become more problematic.
[00:57:33.888 --> 00:57:38.990]  And there's a reverberation factor, Alex, where everybody who's using weather war against each other.
[00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:41.091]  There's the harp in Gakona, Alaska.
[00:57:42.132 --> 00:57:43.433]  Hold on, stay there.
[00:57:43.453 --> 00:57:44.855]  We're also talking to Jefferson and Eric.
[00:57:45.275 --> 00:57:45.816]  Stay with us.
[00:57:45.836 --> 00:57:46.516]  We're gonna hit it all.
[00:57:46.597 --> 00:57:47.558]  Weather, weapons, and more.
[00:57:47.578 --> 00:57:48.078]  Straight ahead.
[00:57:51.061 --> 00:57:52.042]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[00:57:53.877 --> 00:57:59.080]  I wanted to give thanks for all the viewers and listeners that have kept InfoWars in the fight over the years.
[00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:05.263]  The New World Order, their globalist controllers, absolutely hate our guts because they hate your guts.
[00:58:05.303 --> 00:58:06.364]  They want to break your will.
[00:58:06.684 --> 00:58:07.704]  They want to dominate you.
[00:58:07.724 --> 00:58:12.307]  They want to take full control of you and your family and your friends' destiny.
[00:58:12.987 --> 00:58:26.498]  But because of independent media outlets that tell the truth and fight for human liberty, like InfoWars, that wear our bias of freedom and justice and America and God and family on our sleeve.
[00:58:27.642 --> 00:58:35.346]  We have a real fighting chance against the Globals, but that is only because of your tireless dedication and your support of InfoWars.
[00:58:35.366 --> 00:58:44.951]  So again, I'd like to thank you all for your support, and I give thanks for your dedicated prayer, word of mouth, and financial support at InfoWarsTour.com.
[00:58:44.991 --> 00:58:51.134]  And we make it easy to financially keep InfoWars and our media operations and our documentaries and our reports on air.

[01:00:05.432 --> 01:00:15.432]  [BLANK_AUDIO]

[01:00:10.273 --> 01:00:20.655]  I want you to get up right now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and yell, I'M AS MAD AS HELL AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE THIS ANYMORE!

[01:00:35.218 --> 01:00:35.998]  Where are you going?

[01:00:37.658 --> 01:00:40.657]  And stick your head out and yell and keep yelling!
[01:00:40.657 --> 01:00:41.657]  I'm...
[01:00:41.657 --> 01:00:43.858]  I'm mad as hell!
[01:00:43.858 --> 01:00:46.358]  I'm not gonna take this anymore!
[01:00:46.358 --> 01:00:48.957]  I'm mad as hell!

[01:00:57.358 --> 01:01:00.158]  I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!

[01:01:01.358 --> 01:01:02.758]  I'm mad as hell!

[01:01:14.143 --> 01:01:34.143]  [Music]
[01:01:34.143 --> 01:01:36.143]  Zelensky is a demon incarnate.
[01:01:36.783 --> 01:01:40.026]  He tried to start a nuclear war the last two days, but he failed.
[01:01:40.046 --> 01:01:46.032]  All right, in closing, Matt Baker, really appreciate you, brother.
[01:01:46.052 --> 01:01:49.395]  Anything else you'd like to add to the viewers before Mr. Armstrong joins us?
[01:01:51.497 --> 01:01:53.759]  Well, actually, man, you just got me.
[01:01:54.119 --> 01:01:55.280]  You got me to go all there.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.486]   I mean, I literally Crying my eyes out over here.
[01:01:58.586 --> 01:01:59.767]  Barely in the break, dude.
[01:01:59.787 --> 01:02:00.948]  Barely hanging on.
[01:02:01.709 --> 01:02:04.131]  You know, I said it before, I'll say it again.
[01:02:04.151 --> 01:02:22.734]   The amount of anger that you hear in my rants is based on the amount I love the world and I love I love everybody and I want the world to succeed and that's when I see it being stolen, when I see like a baby's throat being slit.
[01:02:22.754 --> 01:02:26.195]  That's how much I love that baby is how mad I'm getting.
[01:02:26.215 --> 01:02:31.576]  And that's why I channel this energy which seems like hate or anger.
[01:02:31.596 --> 01:02:38.457]  It's really directly proportional to the amount which I actually love the universe and I love life.
[01:02:39.317 --> 01:02:42.138]  And I want people to realize how precious it really is.
[01:02:42.478 --> 01:02:44.498]  And we just can't let it slip through our fingers, man.
[01:02:45.368 --> 01:02:45.829]  Absolutely.
[01:02:45.849 --> 01:02:47.852]  You're showing your resistance to their evil.
[01:02:49.274 --> 01:02:49.435]  Yeah.
[01:02:50.285 --> 01:02:51.345]  I have a great song.
[01:02:51.365 --> 01:02:53.946]  I wrote it a long time ago back in the pandemic.
[01:02:54.006 --> 01:02:57.907]  It's a take-off on Ground Control to Major Tom.
[01:02:58.067 --> 01:03:00.308]  It's Mind Control to Major Scam.
[01:03:00.688 --> 01:03:03.169]  I wish you would play it in your breaks every once in a while.
[01:03:03.189 --> 01:03:04.369]  I haven't heard it.
[01:03:04.389 --> 01:03:05.029]  I'll watch it.
[01:03:05.049 --> 01:03:07.270]  Where do we find it?
[01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:08.210]  It's on band.
[01:03:08.591 --> 01:03:10.391]  I actually sent it to Daria earlier.
[01:03:10.411 --> 01:03:11.812]  You can play it.
[01:03:11.932 --> 01:03:12.692]  She's got the link.
[01:03:13.112 --> 01:03:13.772]  You can do it later.
[01:03:13.912 --> 01:03:14.472]  Whatever, man.
[01:03:14.532 --> 01:03:17.793]  What we'll do is we're live now, but we'll add it in post at the end of the interview.
[01:03:17.813 --> 01:03:18.834]  We'll add...
[01:03:20.154 --> 01:03:22.357]  What's the name of the video again?
[01:03:22.518 --> 01:03:24.180]  Mind Control to Major Scam.
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.383]  I don't know if it comes up as that on there.
[01:03:28.486 --> 01:03:31.831]  We'll add it at the end of this interview because we're live right now at 103 Central Time.
[01:03:35.734 --> 01:03:41.279]  And beyond anger and beyond being mad as hell, you know, the greatest victory is living a good life.
[01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:42.880]  Like, I like to have fun.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.602]  I like to make art.
[01:03:44.622 --> 01:03:46.163]  I like to make music.
[01:03:46.623 --> 01:03:48.945]  You know, I like to create and generate things.
[01:03:48.985 --> 01:03:50.607]  This wall behind me, I built.
[01:03:50.767 --> 01:03:53.269]  I'm sitting in a room that I'm actually working.
[01:03:53.289 --> 01:03:54.570]  I'm on a job site right now.
[01:03:54.590 --> 01:03:55.911]  I'm not in a podcast studio.
[01:03:56.371 --> 01:03:59.134]  I'm literally in the building that I built with my bare hands.
[01:03:59.934 --> 01:04:06.036]  I'm working construction, I'm fighting for freedom, I'm doing music, I'm doing art, I'm getting out, I'm speaking out.
[01:04:06.597 --> 01:04:17.460]  And it started as a joke, but play on words because of the Slave to Liberty logo, but it's becoming a reality that I am a slave to liberty.
[01:04:19.708 --> 01:04:21.131]  I can't stop.
[01:04:21.151 --> 01:04:24.276]  I have to maintain liberty.
[01:04:24.436 --> 01:04:25.678]  I have to maintain freedom.
[01:04:25.778 --> 01:04:28.022]  It's like people become a slave to Jesus Christ.
[01:04:28.102 --> 01:04:28.823]  It sounds strange.
[01:04:28.903 --> 01:04:31.788]  It's like, I'm a slave to Jesus and I've never been happier.
[01:04:31.848 --> 01:04:37.436]   It's like, You have to have a meaning in life, and you have to create art.
[01:04:37.536 --> 01:04:40.638]  It's not just about, you know, standing up against them.
[01:04:40.678 --> 01:04:43.241]  It's also about creating our own things.
[01:04:43.361 --> 01:04:44.041]  I totally agree.
[01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:45.462]  We don't just stand against them.
[01:04:45.502 --> 01:04:47.904]  We build the new world, and that is how we win.
[01:04:49.065 --> 01:04:49.646]  Imagine that.
[01:04:49.666 --> 01:04:51.487]  All right, Matt Baker, amazing interview.

[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:10.032]   There are of course those who do not want us to speak We think just like we think.
[01:06:10.052 --> 01:06:15.617]  In fact, even now, orders are being shouts into telephones and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[01:06:15.637 --> 01:06:16.418]  It's Chancellor Settler.
[01:06:18.743 --> 01:06:24.668]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[01:06:25.329 --> 01:06:28.492]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[01:06:31.266 --> 01:06:36.089]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:37.070]  You designed it, sir.
[01:06:37.150 --> 01:06:38.070]  You wanted it foolproof.
[01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:39.451]  You told me every television in London!
[01:06:39.731 --> 01:06:41.833]  Cruelty and injustice.
[01:06:41.853 --> 01:06:43.213]  Intolerance and oppression.
[01:06:43.654 --> 01:06:53.300]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and surveilling your submission.
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:53.480]  Cameras.
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.160]  We need cameras.
[01:06:54.480 --> 01:06:55.201]  How did this happen?
[01:06:55.941 --> 01:06:56.682]  Who's to blame?
[01:06:57.688 --> 01:07:00.312]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:07:00.332 --> 01:07:02.234]  They will be held accountable.
[01:07:02.254 --> 01:07:08.142]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:07:09.344 --> 01:07:10.725]  I know why you did it.
[01:07:10.785 --> 01:07:13.567]  I know you were afraid, fooling me.
[01:07:14.067 --> 01:07:16.108]  War, terror, disease.
[01:07:16.748 --> 01:07:23.092]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:07:23.192 --> 01:07:28.935]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[01:07:29.376 --> 01:07:36.376]   He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:07:36.376 --> 01:07:44.376]  There is a war.
[01:07:44.154 --> 01:07:45.134]  It's happening now.
[01:07:46.015 --> 01:07:47.837]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:07:48.377 --> 01:07:50.219]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:07:50.979 --> 01:07:52.441]  We are the Resistance.
[01:07:52.701 --> 01:07:54.701]  We are the Infowar.
[01:07:54.701 --> 01:08:12.701]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:08:12.787 --> 01:08:14.787]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:08:14.787 --> 01:08:19.787]   ♪ Longing for the sun ♪ ♪ You will come to me ♪
[01:08:19.787 --> 01:08:22.787]  Alright, I've been following his work for 20 years.
[01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:26.865]  Martin Armstrong is an economist, an inventor, stock market expert.
[01:08:26.885 --> 01:08:27.845]  I'm not going to go over his whole bio.
[01:08:27.885 --> 01:08:28.646]  It would take an hour.
[01:08:29.107 --> 01:08:35.833]  ArmstrongEconomics.com, AskDoc-Socrates.com, Ask-Socrates.com.
[01:08:36.413 --> 01:08:41.678]  And he has been, for several years, here on air predicting exactly what we're going through now.
[01:08:42.939 --> 01:08:51.324]  So, I would ask him to cut to the chase with what he's predicting is about to happen, and then walk through the mechanics of all of that, because we need to be ready for what is taking place.
[01:08:52.024 --> 01:08:56.847]  A major political realignment, a major economic realignment taking place on the planet.
[01:08:57.047 --> 01:09:01.789]  Klaus Schwab, two days ago, G20 saying, America's power is over.
[01:09:02.249 --> 01:09:05.111]  I mean, they are really setting us up for a fall.
[01:09:05.591 --> 01:09:09.413]  So, Mr. Armstrong, great to have you with us here today.
[01:09:09.473 --> 01:09:10.514]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:09:11.707 --> 01:09:13.268]  Well, thank you for inviting me, Alex.
[01:09:14.009 --> 01:09:15.930]  So, I'm going to try to give you the floor for most of the hour.
[01:09:17.051 --> 01:09:22.494]  You want to give us the big picture first and walk through it, or you want to start with the technicals and give us the answer?
[01:09:22.514 --> 01:09:23.815]  How do you want to start here?
[01:09:25.176 --> 01:09:30.700]  Well, I think that, you know, people have to understand what is actually taking place here.
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:37.084]  Because a lot of it is just propaganda that tends to try to distract people.
[01:09:38.673 --> 01:09:46.715]  I mean, for years, you know, I've been basically on the opposite side of Schwab in meetings for a long time.
[01:09:47.595 --> 01:10:00.698]  And the reason these governments are lining up with Schwab is because we have a sovereign debt crisis and that's what's taking place.
[01:10:03.656 --> 01:10:07.980]  We've been borrowing since World War II with no intention of ever paying anything back.
[01:10:09.061 --> 01:10:23.395]  And the real crisis here that is developing is that what Yellen came out and was saying that, oh, maybe the Treasury should step in and start buying long-term debt, etc.
[01:10:23.956 --> 01:10:31.226]   And the reason Is that the amount of new debt that came out over COVID, it exploded.
[01:10:31.786 --> 01:10:34.048]  And now you have this Ukrainian war.
[01:10:35.850 --> 01:10:49.243]  And what she's really concerned about is that we have surpassed the ability of basically the primary dealers to even buy the debt.
[01:10:50.177 --> 01:10:56.482]  And people have to understand that the US government traditionally never sold the debt itself.
[01:10:56.602 --> 01:10:59.505]  It went to the bankers and the bankers are the ones that sold it.
[01:11:00.385 --> 01:11:07.091]  So to be a primary dealer, you have to get on the list and you have to guarantee to buy X amount.
[01:11:08.011 --> 01:11:18.541]   And the problem is, is that as we saw in the UK, You know, you can't imagine the losses that pension funds have endured.
[01:11:19.001 --> 01:11:26.506]  They've had long-term bonds and the EU was issuing debt negative in 2014.
[01:11:26.586 --> 01:11:31.388]  So all of a sudden you have interest rates soaring to 4%.
[01:11:31.808 --> 01:11:36.331]  The value of those bonds is just has been collapsing.
[01:11:37.091 --> 01:11:48.545]   So what Yellen was talking about, some people miss Interpreted it and saying that, oh, she's competing with the Federal Reserve.
[01:11:48.585 --> 01:11:49.526]  And that's not true.
[01:11:50.266 --> 01:11:51.806]  The Fed creates the money.
[01:11:51.866 --> 01:11:53.087]  The Treasury does not.
[01:11:53.747 --> 01:11:59.609]  She was talking about buying in long term debt and swapping it for short term.
[01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:09.633]  In other words, that interest rates have been going up so much that what's happened is, is that the bond market itself has been collapsing.
[01:12:10.347 --> 01:12:12.829]  That was the real problem in the UK.
[01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:17.653]  And so she recognizes a twofold problem here.
[01:12:17.913 --> 01:12:22.056]  One is that as interest rates are going up, nobody wants the long term.
[01:12:22.436 --> 01:12:23.637]  They lose too much money.
[01:12:24.338 --> 01:12:38.489]  And two, you have the primary dealers are choking on the debt, because if they have to buy it to keep their franchise, but can't sell it, then you're looking at taking down the banks, you know, like Goldman and all the primary dealers.
[01:12:39.398 --> 01:12:45.843]  So they were largely complaining and that's why she came out and was talking about swapping the debt.
[01:12:47.424 --> 01:12:56.091]  And what Schwab has been tapping into is that these governments know that the jig is up.
[01:12:56.671 --> 01:13:05.629]   If they can't sell the long-term debt, You know, they can no longer continue to fund their appropriations.
[01:13:06.349 --> 01:13:11.193]  And so what you're looking at is a real debt crisis.
[01:13:11.213 --> 01:13:15.676]  And they've been using this Ukrainian war.
[01:13:16.337 --> 01:13:17.798]  They need a distraction.
[01:13:18.238 --> 01:13:19.800]  I mean, Covid was one.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:24.844]  But honestly, they ended up, you know, exploding the debt.
[01:13:26.885 --> 01:13:27.866]  All around the world.
[01:13:28.730 --> 01:13:30.992]  And now they can't really fund it.
[01:13:31.853 --> 01:13:37.478]  And as interest rates go up, the interest expenditures on the government explode.
[01:13:38.358 --> 01:13:44.363]  So, you know, people have to understand that, you know, Keynesian economics was formed in the Great Depression.
[01:13:45.384 --> 01:13:50.889]  And when, you know, he came up with that idea, the United States had a balanced budget.
[01:13:52.020 --> 01:14:03.303]  So, you know, he basically said that's when the government should enter a deficit because the demand in the private sector is contracting.
[01:14:04.063 --> 01:14:10.705]  And to ease the economy, the government spending should increase to compensate for the contraction in the private.
[01:14:11.585 --> 01:14:22.002]   Now, the problem was once you Uh, told the government that, gee, they can actually spend, you know, and go into deficit.
[01:14:23.524 --> 01:14:26.566]  Our politicians have done it year after year after year.
[01:14:26.586 --> 01:14:35.915]  So in all fairness, I mean, they never really, they took one sentence from Keynes and ignore the rest of it.
[01:14:36.135 --> 01:14:48.318]   Keynes also said, you know, you can stimulate the economy by lowering Taxes, you know, they, you know, they go into convulsions if you ever suggest such a thing.
[01:14:48.398 --> 01:14:49.579]  I mean, how dare we?
[01:14:49.659 --> 01:14:50.760]  We always need more.
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:15:07.772]  And so, you know, for 40 some years, I've been dealing with governments and our political system, I think, is collapsing largely because nobody will ever address anything long term.
[01:15:09.341 --> 01:15:14.968]  When I've been in meetings and I said, listen, we can't continue this borrowing indefinitely.
[01:15:15.829 --> 01:15:22.117]  And they would respond, yes, but we're different with the government thinking that somebody will always buy their debt.
[01:15:22.878 --> 01:15:30.759]   And secondly, that they've always said, well, You know, you're talking about something that may hit in 20 years.
[01:15:30.779 --> 01:15:32.019]  I won't be here then.
[01:15:32.159 --> 01:15:33.920]  So that would be somebody else's problem.
[01:15:33.940 --> 01:15:34.520]  All right, stand there.
[01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:35.260]  We got to go to break.
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.481]  Martin Armstrong, famous economist, amazing at predicting things.
[01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:41.622]  We've seen senators and House members say, though, we have unlimited money.
[01:15:42.162 --> 01:15:43.342]  Government can never run out of money.
[01:15:43.382 --> 01:15:44.863]  But we're now coming to that point.
[01:15:45.383 --> 01:15:46.483]  How does this thing break?
[01:15:46.563 --> 01:15:53.266]   What do you see unfolding when you talk about The end of America, the end of the dollar and more with Martin Armstrong.
[01:15:53.307 --> 01:15:53.868]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:15:53.888 --> 01:15:54.309]  Stay with us.

[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:08.281]  There's a solution.
[01:17:08.661 --> 01:17:09.602]  The Wellness Company.

[01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:08.451]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[01:18:09.132 --> 01:18:17.114]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we just... It's election month, Alex.
[01:18:17.194 --> 01:18:18.275]  It's not election day.
[01:18:18.755 --> 01:18:19.835]  And that's the problem.
[01:18:20.435 --> 01:18:23.076]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[01:18:23.196 --> 01:18:25.957]  They illegally changed state elections.
[01:18:26.857 --> 01:18:32.019]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[01:18:32.399 --> 01:18:34.360]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:38.121]  We are in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[01:18:38.681 --> 01:18:56.352]   And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity, and question the fact that elections Shouldn't be run the way they are.
[01:18:56.653 --> 01:18:57.996]  We're not election deniers.
[01:18:58.037 --> 01:18:59.420]  We're election realists.
[01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:07.077]  For only the second time in the entirety of the InfoWars store, we are announcing a selling out mega blowout sale.

[01:20:01.797 --> 01:20:07.636]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones
[01:20:07.636 --> 01:20:25.037]   One of the top economists out there we spent the whole hour about his bio I'm not gonna do it. It's Martin Armstrong
[01:20:25.085 --> 01:20:28.227]  He has predicted everything that's happened in the last 25, 30 years.
[01:20:28.947 --> 01:20:30.568]  And he's here making some really scary predictions.
[01:20:30.588 --> 01:20:33.530]  We're coming to an end of a cycle, an end of a system.
[01:20:33.570 --> 01:20:36.912]  I have the head of the European Central Bank saying, we're coming to an end.
[01:20:36.972 --> 01:20:37.713]  It's collapsing.
[01:20:37.733 --> 01:20:43.696]  We've got to move to a new digital currency that controls every facet of our lives and creates a new Ponzi scheme with carbon taxes.
[01:20:43.716 --> 01:20:46.138]  So you're getting into all the technicals last segment.
[01:20:46.988 --> 01:20:56.153]  I want you to drill back into those, Martin, but big picture, how would you describe the world economy, the different players, the different groups, and where we're at, and what are you predicting is about to happen?
[01:20:58.114 --> 01:21:12.883]  Well, what they've been doing is we have, we have, I would say, another little group that really have the White House in control, and they're the climate change people.
[01:21:13.826 --> 01:21:22.770]  And they are the ones that are really, I'm not sure if they're just completely insane or they actually know what they're doing.
[01:21:23.791 --> 01:21:33.669]   But trying to shut down fossil fuels on a global scale without alternatives already in place is really insane.
[01:21:34.249 --> 01:21:37.111]  And this is causing the civil unrest to rise.
[01:21:37.131 --> 01:21:40.774]  And we're seeing that outside the United States first.
[01:21:41.395 --> 01:21:46.699]  Eventually, it will get to the United States, but we're looking at probably a lot more civil unrest next year.
[01:21:46.719 --> 01:21:53.385]  And we have to understand that energy is priced in dollars.
[01:21:53.765 --> 01:21:59.565]   So as the dollar has been going up, Uh, their energy costs have exploded.
[01:22:00.427 --> 01:22:07.337]  And this is why you're seeing civil unrest in everywhere from Asia and Sri Lanka to Pakistan.
[01:22:07.357 --> 01:22:12.425]  Um, you know, it's it's just spreading and it will continue.
[01:22:13.834 --> 01:22:16.956]  Thanks also, you know, to the COVID lockdowns, etc.
[01:22:16.976 --> 01:22:25.220]  I mean, we just had a conference in Orlando last week, and like three of our staff, they wouldn't even let into the country.
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:29.201]  You know, they're stranded off in Dubai.
[01:22:30.162 --> 01:22:33.984]  But it's just, you know, this is what's happening.
[01:22:34.664 --> 01:22:43.798]   The economic system That we've been under with these people and the central banks are no longer able to really control anything.
[01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:56.330]  Raising interest rates to stop inflation only makes more inflation because this type of inflation is based upon shortages.
[01:22:56.972 --> 01:23:12.316]  The COVID nonsense, lockdown, everything that we had as far as the supply chain, and as a result... And by the way, just to interrupt you, look, the head of the European Central Bank just said yesterday they're losing control.
[01:23:12.336 --> 01:23:17.837]  To have a central bank head saying they're losing control, that's got to be a terrifying statement.
[01:23:19.697 --> 01:23:22.198]  Yes, you know, this is what we saw in London.
[01:23:22.874 --> 01:23:27.416]  Okay, that the long term debt, nobody wants it.
[01:23:28.056 --> 01:23:32.138]  You've wiped out all the pension funds in Europe.
[01:23:32.478 --> 01:23:33.019]  They're broke.
[01:23:33.779 --> 01:23:34.179]  All right.
[01:23:34.239 --> 01:23:37.961]  You took interest rates to negative in 2014.
[01:23:38.481 --> 01:23:44.444]  And then you also had a law saying that pension funds had to be secure and had to buy government debt.
[01:23:45.104 --> 01:23:47.585]  I mean, they need a percent to break even.
[01:23:48.368 --> 01:23:52.351]  We have, as you know, we're probably the largest in the world.
[01:23:52.391 --> 01:23:56.573]  We have clients with portfolios of over a trillion dollars.
[01:23:57.073 --> 01:24:02.817]  And we get requests, can you create a green portfolio that they just break even?
[01:24:02.837 --> 01:24:10.822]  Because they have to have green investments politically to satisfy the politicians, but they lose money on everything.
[01:24:10.842 --> 01:24:15.225]  I mean, it's an absolute insane world that we're looking at.
[01:24:15.465 --> 01:24:16.165]  And that's the SEGs.
[01:24:16.245 --> 01:24:17.106]  Explain SEGs.
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:24.407]  Well, basically, there's nothing that they can actually make money on.
[01:24:24.427 --> 01:24:28.873]  I mean, you just look at Germany.
[01:24:28.913 --> 01:24:35.702]  I mean, these people are so climate insane that they don't even want nuclear power.
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:48.402]  I mean, I think the former head of Greenpeace came out and said to AOC, I mean, how are people going to get their food into the into cities, horse and buggy?
[01:24:48.422 --> 01:24:52.223]  I mean, it's gotten really insane with these people.
[01:24:52.343 --> 01:25:02.225]  And they are looking at it, saying that they have to destroy as much of our energy capacity to produce.
[01:25:03.391 --> 01:25:07.112]  In case the other side gets back in, they won't be able to rebuild it.
[01:25:07.272 --> 01:25:08.773]  And that's really what they're trying to do.
[01:25:09.013 --> 01:25:14.415]  Quantify that, that's so huge, because they have all the energy heads saying, we're in transition, we're destroying the old system.
[01:25:14.935 --> 01:25:16.876]  You said, quote, so the other side can't get in.
[01:25:16.916 --> 01:25:17.536]  That is so key.
[01:25:17.596 --> 01:25:18.316]  Elaborate on that.
[01:25:19.597 --> 01:25:29.157]   Yeah, I mean, if you destroy most of your capacity, your ability to produce energy, All right.
[01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:30.478]  That's what they want.
[01:25:30.518 --> 01:25:33.959]  They don't want us to be able to go ever go back to fossil fuels.
[01:25:34.439 --> 01:25:41.601]  This is really why the West is using Ukraine as cannon fodder against Russia.
[01:25:42.361 --> 01:25:44.422]  Russia is the biggest energy producer.
[01:25:44.442 --> 01:25:48.463]  50 percent of their GDP is all is all energy.
[01:25:49.033 --> 01:25:52.416]  It's why the US, you know, basically took out their pipeline.
[01:25:53.257 --> 01:25:57.020]  If you go back to Syria, why did Obama wanted to go into Syria?
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:03.827]  Because Qatar wanted to put a pipeline through Syria to cut off the supply from Russia, and he refused.
[01:26:04.407 --> 01:26:10.373]  And so right away he wanted to go in and say, oh, they abused their people, but he lost.
[01:26:11.214 --> 01:26:14.577]  And we, you know, Americans are getting tired of these endless wars.
[01:26:16.925 --> 01:26:22.429]  I was actually went to Mar-a-Lago to see Trump back in March of 2020.
[01:26:24.050 --> 01:26:26.693]  And I've met many heads of state.
[01:26:27.433 --> 01:26:33.278]  But I will say this for all the people that don't like Trump, I was actually impressed for the first time.
[01:26:34.479 --> 01:26:35.640]  He was a world leader.
[01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:41.785]  And he actually said that he wanted to pull the troops out of Afghanistan.
[01:26:42.515 --> 01:26:48.778]  Because he was sick and tired of writing letters to their parents and saying their son died for God and country.
[01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:53.460]  And he said, point blank, he says, what are we there for?
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.642]  They've been fighting over borders for a thousand years.
[01:26:56.722 --> 01:26:58.242]  What difference are we going to make?
[01:26:58.903 --> 01:27:00.303]  That's why Bolton came out.
[01:27:00.383 --> 01:27:01.404]  No, he has to be.
[01:27:01.564 --> 01:27:03.585]  He's terrible president, blah, blah, blah.
[01:27:03.985 --> 01:27:08.327]  But he was the first head of state of any country that I ever encountered.
[01:27:09.332 --> 01:27:12.973]  Whoever was concerned about the people that actually died on the battlefield.
[01:27:14.413 --> 01:27:17.994]  I mean, they all want, oh, look, this is a war we have to defeat.
[01:27:18.074 --> 01:27:19.494]  Russia, we should push them out.
[01:27:20.254 --> 01:27:22.135]  How many lives is that going to cost?
[01:27:22.195 --> 01:27:30.437]  How many children will be, you know, lose their fathers and grow up as, you know, without, you know... Martin, I totally agree.
[01:27:30.497 --> 01:27:31.377]  And we got to go to break again.
[01:27:31.397 --> 01:27:32.337]  A long segment is coming up.
[01:27:32.377 --> 01:27:36.338]  But just quantify, how would you describe the world economy right now?
[01:27:38.729 --> 01:27:45.914]  Basically, we're collapsing and I don't think you'll see the dollar remain as a viable currency after 2028.
[01:27:46.855 --> 01:27:48.897]  Well, you talk about they're destabilizing things.
[01:27:49.017 --> 01:27:53.300]  Schwab brags they're destabilizing things on purpose to bring in what?
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:55.201]  But doesn't he know he's getting the blame now?
[01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:57.543]  He thinks he can do this collapse and not get the blame.
[01:27:57.923 --> 01:27:59.825]  Do you think things are going well for the WEF?
[01:28:01.286 --> 01:28:06.430]  No, look, I mean, Schwab, I can tell you that he is a control freak.
[01:28:07.190 --> 01:28:12.816]  This is why everything he is proposing is absolute control.
[01:28:13.937 --> 01:28:16.799]  Chips and people and all sorts of crazy ideas.
[01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:25.448]  He's an academic, and every academic I've ever encountered are Marxists.
[01:28:27.834 --> 01:28:33.821]  His view is Marxism would have succeeded had they also had Europe and the United States.
[01:28:34.342 --> 01:28:37.145]  So this is what they're pushing here.
[01:28:37.165 --> 01:28:39.047]  A one world government.
[01:28:39.107 --> 01:28:42.591]  They think the UN can basically then control everybody.
[01:28:42.611 --> 01:28:44.153]  I mean, it's going to fail.
[01:28:44.213 --> 01:28:46.936]  Our computer shows that it's going to absolutely fail.
[01:28:47.536 --> 01:28:54.037]  Absolutely, and he is an admitted Marxist, an ultra-rich Marxist, who believes we were all robots, then his utopia would work.
[01:28:54.557 --> 01:28:57.538]  Another bureaucrat control freak, Martin Armstrong's our guest.
[01:28:57.558 --> 01:28:57.898]  Stay with us.
[01:29:00.678 --> 01:29:05.699]  Someone compared me to Socrates, which is a compliment, but he was vilified.
[01:29:05.739 --> 01:29:11.900]  He ended up poisoning himself in Athens, and the charge against him, if you read about his poisoning and his arrest, they said he was corrupting the youth.
[01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:14.561]  But he wasn't corrupting them, he was inspiring them to challenge authority.
[01:29:14.581 --> 01:29:16.121]  He was inspiring them to think for themselves.
[01:29:16.761 --> 01:29:22.704]  When you have the youth, the masculine youth of the world, thinking for themselves, that's pretty scary to authority.
[01:29:23.364 --> 01:29:29.527]  Because it's the masculine youth of the world that is, one, the revolutionaries, and two, also, that's the backbone of the slave force.
[01:29:30.128 --> 01:29:33.209]  If you need people to go die in a ditch in Afghanistan, you need them.
[01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:39.152]  More than you need the feminists and the liberals, you need the real men to go out there to purport and prop up a system.
[01:29:39.312 --> 01:29:44.035]  And if enough of these men stand in one place and say, this is enough, that's when a revolution happens.
[01:29:44.375 --> 01:29:53.997]   So this is the most dangerous, There's a group of the demographic that the Matrix and the people are trying to control and they have to have a narrative over and that's why they're trying to weaken them in every regard.
[01:29:55.259 --> 01:30:06.907]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker, and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has truly earned the title of Top G. But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged the globalists.
[01:30:07.307 --> 01:30:12.451]  He is consecutively the most Googled man in the world in the last two years.
[01:30:12.711 --> 01:30:17.334]  And that's because his message is about human, and specifically, male empowerment.
[01:30:17.815 --> 01:30:23.479]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.
[01:30:24.059 --> 01:30:26.420]  Introducing Top G Supplements.
[01:30:27.020 --> 01:30:32.042]  We are proud to introduce and sponsor the Top G line of supplements by Andrew Tate and his crew.
[01:30:32.642 --> 01:30:33.562]  Feared Opponent.

[01:31:04.261 --> 01:31:05.243]  My life is a fight.
[01:31:05.303 --> 01:31:06.464]  What do you mean I'm not fighting a battle?
[01:31:06.504 --> 01:31:08.627]  I'm fighting a battle against the oppression of humankind.
[01:31:09.008 --> 01:31:13.274]  AndrewTatePower.com The only way you fail is not taking action.
[01:31:13.634 --> 01:31:18.061]   AndrewTatePower.com They see me as a threat because of my mass influence.
[01:31:18.341 --> 01:31:23.304]  And me being positive in and of itself is also a threat to the establishment because they don't want people to be happy.
[01:31:23.324 --> 01:31:28.808]  They want you to be semi-depressed and sad and miserable because when you're sad, you're self-obsessed.
[01:31:29.129 --> 01:31:29.689]  And you're distracted.
[01:31:30.009 --> 01:31:31.490]  You're distracted and you're self-obsessed.
[01:31:31.530 --> 01:31:34.773]  When you're sad, you're sitting at home, me, me, me, me.
[01:31:34.853 --> 01:31:35.793]  It makes you very selfish.
[01:31:35.873 --> 01:31:37.615]  You don't care about your community when you're sad.
[01:31:37.975 --> 01:31:42.018]  So the fact that I have mass influence and I can just make people feel better is a threat to them.
[01:31:42.518 --> 01:31:44.239]  They don't want me to make people feel better.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:50.664]  They talk about men's mental health and pretend to care, but when I come along and genuinely help and stop people from committing suicide, they delete me.
[01:31:50.704 --> 01:31:51.265]  They don't want that.
[01:31:51.305 --> 01:31:52.485]  They want everybody semi-depressed.
[01:31:53.026 --> 01:31:53.867]  They want you miserable.
[01:31:54.027 --> 01:31:59.851]  They want you distracted, so that you're too busy crying your eyes out in a room somewhere, so they can just continue to run the world.

[01:33:01.916 --> 01:33:08.037]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.037 --> 01:33:12.596]  [music]
[01:33:12.596 --> 01:33:18.876]  [music]
[01:33:18.815 --> 01:33:27.981]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:29.261 --> 01:33:31.082]  ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[01:33:31.683 --> 01:33:33.584]  Martin Armstrong's been joining us for decades.
[01:33:33.624 --> 01:33:37.126]  He is probably the most accurate predictor of the future.
[01:33:37.146 --> 01:33:41.669]  He's giving you all the details and facts and background, but how does this break?
[01:33:41.829 --> 01:33:43.690]  I mean, what are the different scenarios?
[01:33:44.230 --> 01:33:45.291]  What should the public know?
[01:33:46.011 --> 01:33:50.032]  When we've got the head of the European Central Bank saying we've lost power, everything's collapsing.
[01:33:50.772 --> 01:33:54.833]  You've got Schwab laughing, saying once it all collapses, they'll be able to reorder it.
[01:33:54.873 --> 01:33:55.973]  But he's getting the blame.
[01:33:56.453 --> 01:33:57.534]  He thought that wouldn't happen.
[01:33:57.554 --> 01:34:02.035]  He thought they would collapse things and then use the crisis to get control themselves.
[01:34:02.075 --> 01:34:03.255]  I don't see it going that way.
[01:34:03.315 --> 01:34:08.096]  So looking out over the horizon, short-term, mid-term, long-term, what does Martin Armstrong see?
[01:34:10.357 --> 01:34:16.281]  Well, we see a tremendous rise in civil unrest globally next year.
[01:34:16.301 --> 01:34:22.245]  And it is, as I said, Schwab is an academic.
[01:34:23.005 --> 01:34:27.408]  He actually has a bust of Lenin on his bookshelf.
[01:34:27.428 --> 01:34:32.511]  You know, this is what he believes.
[01:34:32.891 --> 01:34:38.995]  And everybody that he has there is largely on that same agenda.
[01:34:40.276 --> 01:34:42.097]  It's not going to work.
[01:34:42.117 --> 01:34:52.001]  I mean, the primary reason that communism failed is because it attempted to make everybody just drones.
[01:34:53.722 --> 01:34:59.504]  I was called in by China to help them actually become capitalists.
[01:35:00.024 --> 01:35:02.465]  And it was a very interesting experience.
[01:35:02.966 --> 01:35:12.478]   I went there and effectively, I had to explain Very fundamental economic principles.
[01:35:12.498 --> 01:35:17.664]  I mean, they wanted to know, like, why one tea was selling at a different price someplace else.
[01:35:18.365 --> 01:35:21.869]  And I said, first, you have transportation costs.
[01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:24.432]  And they were like, oh, wow, really?
[01:35:24.953 --> 01:35:29.598]  I said, then somebody will pay more for something that they prefer over another.
[01:35:30.447 --> 01:35:46.078]  So, you know, this is why communism fell, because basically if a tea was priced at $1 here and $1 all within the other side of the country, but it cost $10 to get it there, that's why communism collapsed.
[01:35:47.419 --> 01:35:53.728]   And you have these people like Schwab who just are I don't know.
[01:35:53.868 --> 01:35:56.349]  I mean, they're brain dead or what?
[01:35:56.429 --> 01:35:58.909]  But, uh, they keep trying.
[01:35:58.929 --> 01:36:01.670]  You make statements like you'll own nothing and like it.
[01:36:01.690 --> 01:36:04.370]  And exactly the point you make.
[01:36:04.450 --> 01:36:06.710]  Well, why is T $20 here and $10 here?
[01:36:06.951 --> 01:36:09.451]  Because the shipping cost and where it's got to go is more.
[01:36:09.891 --> 01:36:11.691]  They don't even understand basic things.
[01:36:11.751 --> 01:36:13.192]  It is the dumbest ideology.
[01:36:13.672 --> 01:36:15.092]  Why does it keep taking over then?
[01:36:16.912 --> 01:36:19.113]  Because, you know, I don't know.
[01:36:19.253 --> 01:36:24.941]   I mean, it's, Schwab and I have been on opposite sides for decades.
[01:36:25.541 --> 01:36:33.365]  I mean, Marcus Vetter came and did the movie on me, The Forecaster, and it was funded by a German TV station.
[01:36:33.726 --> 01:36:37.367]  Schwab then called him and said, hey, I want you to do a movie on us.
[01:36:37.387 --> 01:36:46.166]   So Marcus filmed, it's called The Forum, on I mean, whatever I've done, he then tries to copy.
[01:36:46.426 --> 01:36:51.408]  It's just, it has been a war for decades between us.
[01:36:51.448 --> 01:36:54.469]  We started our first World Economic Conference in 1985.
[01:36:54.589 --> 01:36:58.191]  He started his first World Economic Forum in 1987.
[01:36:58.271 --> 01:37:03.533]  It's just, you know, we're on opposite sides.
[01:37:03.613 --> 01:37:05.634]  I mean, Nigel Farage came to ours in 2019.
[01:37:07.327 --> 01:37:08.688]  And he said, of course I'm here.
[01:37:09.108 --> 01:37:12.971]  He says, you know, basically Armstrong is the alternative to Davos.
[01:37:14.112 --> 01:37:19.215]  I mean, this has been a longstanding war between the two of us for a long time.
[01:37:20.216 --> 01:37:21.697]  He's just an academic.
[01:37:22.297 --> 01:37:23.918]  Does he know how much trouble he's in?
[01:37:23.938 --> 01:37:26.640]  Because he's probably more hated than Bill Gates right now.
[01:37:26.700 --> 01:37:29.322]  I mean, he is hated as much as Hitler right now.
[01:37:31.044 --> 01:37:42.050]  Yeah, look, I mean, this is the problem and he has used his influence to buy time with these politicians.
[01:37:43.513 --> 01:37:45.894]  And most look at what we have out there.
[01:37:45.974 --> 01:37:47.875]  I mean, you've got Trudeau in Canada.
[01:37:47.915 --> 01:37:54.078]  You've got who they call, you know, Mrs. Head down in New Zealand.
[01:37:54.458 --> 01:37:59.821]  I mean, all these people he's training and stick them in there and these various different governments.
[01:38:01.422 --> 01:38:02.562]  It is horrible.
[01:38:02.762 --> 01:38:03.963]  Absolutely horrible.
[01:38:04.043 --> 01:38:10.506]  But not a you know, it's a debate as to who is the worst world leader.
[01:38:10.626 --> 01:38:11.767]  I mean, look at Biden.
[01:38:13.183 --> 01:38:17.165]  He's senile and he just reads whatever the cue cards basically say.
[01:38:17.405 --> 01:38:22.967]  And it's who's, you know, the real president is who's writing the cue cards.
[01:38:22.987 --> 01:38:24.227]  So what should we look for next?
[01:38:24.247 --> 01:38:26.428]  Because you've been predicting major upheaval.
[01:38:26.488 --> 01:38:27.109]  It's now happening.
[01:38:27.149 --> 01:38:28.269]  What are you predicting comes next?
[01:38:29.269 --> 01:38:32.030]  Well, I think we're going to start seeing a lot of civil unrest.
[01:38:32.811 --> 01:38:41.546]   I mean, I mean, I think this is the longest time it has ever taken to Even say who won an election.
[01:38:41.566 --> 01:38:46.808]  I mean, we've always known that night or maybe the day after, not a week later.
[01:38:48.129 --> 01:38:53.952]  My own staff could have wrote a program, you know, in less than 30 days that everybody can vote.
[01:38:54.012 --> 01:38:59.574]  I mean, if we can buy on Amazon safely, why can't we vote on a computer safely?
[01:38:59.954 --> 01:39:02.415]  What's with all these paper ballots all of a sudden?
[01:39:03.196 --> 01:39:08.418]  I mean, I know people in Canada that were getting ballots, mail-in ballots, and they're not even American.
[01:39:10.705 --> 01:39:19.889]  Pennsylvania got caught over, you know, sending out 200,000 mail-in ballots and they weren't even verified as to if they were American or not.
[01:39:20.170 --> 01:39:21.010]  Let's switch gears.
[01:39:21.030 --> 01:39:24.032]  You've been really on the Ukraine crisis with Russia.
[01:39:24.572 --> 01:39:28.854]  This news, a false flag with a missile attempt, blew up in their face, pun intended.
[01:39:29.034 --> 01:39:30.275]  What do you see happening there?
[01:39:34.157 --> 01:39:36.218]  Ukraine I know very well.
[01:39:37.038 --> 01:39:43.206]   We actually haven't had employees from Donetsk as well as from Kiev. And I can
[01:39:43.206 --> 01:39:48.315]   tell you that you can't even bring a Russian bottle of vodka to dinner in Kiev. It's an insult.
[01:39:48.315 --> 01:39:56.975]   It goes back very long time, the hatred in that area. There is no resolution. Zelensky
[01:39:56.975 --> 01:40:00.685]  is nothing but propaganda, basically.
[01:40:00.972 --> 01:40:02.772]  I mean, he puts out all this stuff.
[01:40:03.612 --> 01:40:17.675]  Adelaide University has just come out and confirmed that the vast majority of all these pro-Ukrainian comments all over the place are done by Ukrainian bots.
[01:40:18.436 --> 01:40:19.876]  He is losing the war.
[01:40:20.616 --> 01:40:22.217]  That's really what this is about.
[01:40:22.938 --> 01:40:33.667]  My info from over there from the Ukrainian side said that 300,000 soldiers have been injured and 100,000 Ukrainian soldiers are dead.
[01:40:35.228 --> 01:40:42.093]  And he keeps trying to pretend that, you know, he's winning, Russia's gonna fail and all this other kind of stuff.
[01:40:42.874 --> 01:40:56.075]   This latest missile thing, I mean, You know, he's refusing to keep saying that it's all nothing but, oh, it's Russia, Russia, Russia.
[01:40:56.095 --> 01:41:01.159]  And he wants to get, you know, he's trying desperately to create World War III.
[01:41:01.899 --> 01:41:03.981]  I mean, he's a very dangerous man.
[01:41:04.782 --> 01:41:07.804]  And it's unbelievable.
[01:41:07.885 --> 01:41:11.588]  But, you know, we should not be supporting Ukraine whatsoever.
[01:41:11.608 --> 01:41:14.170]  I agree with Henry Kissinger.
[01:41:14.190 --> 01:41:26.329]   The don't ask is Historically, Russian territory, and I'm talking about back to the days of the Tsar, and that's why you have Russian people living there.
[01:41:26.369 --> 01:41:27.850]  Sure, so how do you see this ending?
[01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:29.112]  Because even their secret U.S.
[01:41:29.152 --> 01:41:32.236]  talks now, Ukraine has tried a false flag.
[01:41:33.357 --> 01:41:33.918]  What comes next?
[01:41:36.067 --> 01:41:46.867]  All I can hope for is that the West wakes up and knocks off this insane proxy war, which is basically what it is.
[01:41:49.488 --> 01:41:59.272]  But unfortunately, I think we're going into World War Three and it's probably going to hit after or in 2025, going into maybe 27.
[01:42:00.393 --> 01:42:04.675]  And because we do the same thing with Taiwan.
[01:42:05.235 --> 01:42:10.877]  He sent Pelosi over there just before the Communist Convention.
[01:42:11.417 --> 01:42:18.076]   I mean, that's like, yes, you better give, you know, Gee, you know, absolute control.
[01:42:18.096 --> 01:42:21.257]  I mean, why would you do that just ahead of that?
[01:42:21.317 --> 01:42:23.058]  Of course that supported him.
[01:42:24.398 --> 01:42:34.820]  You know, I don't know who's making these decisions in Washington, but they seem to be intentionally trying to make the world far worse rather than better.
[01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:35.560]  Exactly.
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:36.120]  Stay there.
[01:42:36.140 --> 01:42:36.640]  Stay there.
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:39.221]  Martin Armstrong, armstrongeconomics.com.
[01:42:40.202 --> 01:42:41.803]  You cover any other big topics you want.
[01:42:42.204 --> 01:42:45.027]  I've got a lot of questions, but you're smarter than I am about economics, what's happening.
[01:42:45.447 --> 01:42:49.192]  What is your advice to the American people, people of the world, about the time and place we're in right now?
[01:42:49.292 --> 01:42:51.955]  Final segment with our special guest, Mr. Armstrong.
[01:42:51.975 --> 01:42:53.837]  Then, Paul Joseph wants to take over.
[01:42:53.657 --> 01:43:10.056]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:10.023 --> 01:43:17.946]  Elon Musk has hinted at this himself, but when he spoke out against returning Alex Jones to the platform, there were obvious concerns.
[01:43:18.406 --> 01:43:28.890]  Now, what I think might be going on, Elon Musk is making a business decision knowing that if Alex Jones is allowed back on the platform, Twitter might get removed from the App Store.
[01:43:28.949 --> 01:43:30.989]  "Oh, you can't have it on your iPhone.
[01:43:30.989 --> 01:43:33.489]  "Oh, you can't have it on your Android anymore."
[01:43:33.489 --> 01:43:41.788]   And now that one of the head tech executives and app manufacturers at Apple has removed his account,
[01:43:41.788 --> 01:43:43.788]  could be a sign of things to come.
[01:43:43.788 --> 01:43:49.090]   Now others think it might be a personal choice that Elon Musk made to not let Alex Jones
[01:43:49.090 --> 01:43:50.449]  back on the platform.
[01:43:50.449 --> 01:43:56.010]   Now here was Alex Jones' response to the news of Elon Musk not reinstating his account.
[01:43:56.010 --> 01:44:01.149]   The ADL and the Southern Primary Law Center, the Democratic Party and the European Union
[01:44:01.149 --> 01:44:06.109]   and the Justice Department and CIA moles that Congress had hearings on last week
[01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:14.568]   are inside of his company right now and are literally trying to sabotage it,
[01:44:14.568 --> 01:44:20.028]   not just externally with threats of lawsuits and censorship and criminal charges from the EU,
[01:44:20.028 --> 01:44:25.590]   but they're also threatening to sabotage the company and the actual systems that make it operate.
[01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:27.128]  So--
[01:44:26.853 --> 01:44:27.990]  He hit the panic button.
[01:44:28.886 --> 01:44:33.027]  And basically came out and attacked me so that he can get the left off of his back.
[01:44:33.687 --> 01:44:51.071]  And, you know, it's fine to me that he did that, except he went too far and compared himself to Jesus and the whole, bring the children to me, suffer the children to me, and if you offend one of these, if you're mean to one of these kids, it's better for you to kill yourself by tying a big bowl to your neck and throwing it in the ocean.
[01:44:51.652 --> 01:44:52.612]  That's just outrageous.
[01:44:52.632 --> 01:44:57.073]  That's absolutely outrageous that I'm supposedly the worst guy in the world because of media hype.
[01:44:57.913 --> 01:45:01.215]  That massively has misrepresented what I really said about Sandy Hook.
[01:45:01.736 --> 01:45:10.962]  If Elon loves to quote Christ so much in between dressing up like Satan, he should quote Christ's most famous quote.
[01:45:11.742 --> 01:45:14.342]  Let he without sin cast the first stone.
[01:45:14.342 --> 01:45:17.342]  But that story will carry itself out.

[01:46:32.219 --> 01:46:34.560]  Maybe we get back on Twitter, maybe we don't.

[01:47:02.822 --> 01:47:06.903]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:07.222 --> 01:47:09.222]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:09.222 --> 01:47:24.222]  The plot to seize Russia.
[01:47:24.222 --> 01:47:25.782]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:47:25.663 --> 01:47:26.623]  The Top Economist.
[01:47:26.643 --> 01:47:28.504]  I mean, I've been following this stuff for 30 years.
[01:47:28.564 --> 01:47:29.064]  Had him on for 20.
[01:47:29.224 --> 01:47:30.764]  Only a couple times here.
[01:47:30.785 --> 01:47:31.585]  We should get him on more often.
[01:47:31.605 --> 01:47:32.225]  He's hard to get on.
[01:47:32.665 --> 01:47:33.545]  Martin Armstrong.
[01:47:33.605 --> 01:47:34.706]  ArmstrongEconomics.com.
[01:47:35.646 --> 01:47:43.128]  During the break, I said, Mr. Armstrong, condense all your predictions and warnings into this segment, and can we stop World War III?
[01:47:43.148 --> 01:47:44.368]  And he said, probably not.
[01:47:44.929 --> 01:47:45.549]  They need it.
[01:47:46.029 --> 01:47:48.770]  The globalists need it as a smoke screen for the Great Reset.
[01:47:48.790 --> 01:47:52.871]  So, sir, give us that knowledge and talk about your new book and where this is all going.
[01:47:54.847 --> 01:48:01.150]  Well, their theory is, is to create a new Brenton Woods.
[01:48:02.191 --> 01:48:06.573]  And to get out of all the debt, they will default on it.
[01:48:06.693 --> 01:48:10.896]  And that's why Schwab is saying, you'll own nothing and be happy.
[01:48:10.916 --> 01:48:15.118]  He's trying to make it sound that you're the one in trouble, not them.
[01:48:15.956 --> 01:48:22.218]  And that they will relieve you of all your debts, and they're being generous in helping you.
[01:48:22.638 --> 01:48:27.780]  When in fact, it's their debts that they're going to default on, but that wipes out all the pension funds.
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:30.141]  Social Security is 100% U.S.
[01:48:30.361 --> 01:48:31.101]  government debt.
[01:48:32.181 --> 01:48:43.585]  And so they think that using the war, that that will be the justification to create another Bretton Woods after World War II.
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:47.324]  And then they get to re-establish everything.
[01:48:47.524 --> 01:48:54.573]  And for 40 years in governments that I've been talking to, their view is that they are not the problem, we are.
[01:48:55.294 --> 01:49:01.702]  And that if you found a $100 bill on the parking lot, you cheated them out of their $50, you know, their share.
[01:49:03.809 --> 01:49:09.372]  You know, they never consider anything whatsoever about, you know, themselves.
[01:49:09.712 --> 01:49:12.353]  As I've said, there's no mirrors in Washington.
[01:49:12.774 --> 01:49:14.515]  So it's always about us.
[01:49:14.755 --> 01:49:17.716]  And we do not comply with what they want to do.
[01:49:17.756 --> 01:49:19.957]  And that's why they want the digital currencies.
[01:49:20.858 --> 01:49:23.739]  Because if I gave you $100, that's fine.
[01:49:23.779 --> 01:49:25.380]  They don't know where I got it from.
[01:49:25.700 --> 01:49:31.143]  But if it's a digital currency, they know where I even got it from and can follow it all the way down the line.
[01:49:32.205 --> 01:49:38.188]  So, I mean, this is all getting to be, you know, very draconian.
[01:49:38.268 --> 01:49:40.249]  But I mean, this is their objective.
[01:49:41.069 --> 01:49:44.351]  And that's what Schwab is really saying with the Great Reset.
[01:49:44.451 --> 01:49:52.134]  And he has sold this idea to governments as a whole as their way to escape from the debt crisis.
[01:49:52.994 --> 01:49:55.736]  And it's just going to be complete mess.
[01:49:55.776 --> 01:49:58.597]  And then he thinks he can recreate things.
[01:49:59.404 --> 01:50:01.145]  Uh, and you can't.
[01:50:01.665 --> 01:50:08.047]  I mean, uh, the reason we became the biggest in the world was because we did foreign exchange.
[01:50:08.067 --> 01:50:09.127]  All right.
[01:50:09.187 --> 01:50:11.588]  We were the first ever to do anything like that.
[01:50:12.108 --> 01:50:21.590]  And when we were going to open an office in 1985, I had, you know, um, lunch with one of the top, uh, bankers of, uh, in Switzerland.
[01:50:22.231 --> 01:50:27.192]  And I had a list of you of farm and foreign names, you know, European advisors, whatever.
[01:50:28.067 --> 01:50:31.269]  And he said, name one European analyst.
[01:50:31.329 --> 01:50:32.790]  And I was embarrassed because I couldn't.
[01:50:33.491 --> 01:50:35.332]  And he said, there are none.
[01:50:35.712 --> 01:50:44.018]  Because after World War Two, every politician used the rise in the currency from zero as proof that he did a good job.
[01:50:44.598 --> 01:50:49.141]  So no bank analyst would ever come out and say, oh, the Deutsche Mark is going to go down.
[01:50:49.221 --> 01:50:50.682]  That was, you know, political.
[01:50:51.405 --> 01:50:55.967]  So we became the biggest, and he says, because you don't care if the dollar goes up or down.
[01:50:55.987 --> 01:50:57.487]  I said, it's just a trade to me.
[01:50:57.507 --> 01:50:58.107]  That's it.
[01:50:59.608 --> 01:51:01.749]  So that's how we became so big.
[01:51:01.809 --> 01:51:07.691]  It was just simply our, you know, foreign exchange was our, you know, our real forte.
[01:51:08.331 --> 01:51:13.893]  And you have to understand that that's why all the governments called us in for this, that, the other thing.
[01:51:13.973 --> 01:51:20.401]   I mean, it was You know, I got called in for creating the G5 back in 85, the 87 crash.
[01:51:21.082 --> 01:51:23.906]  You know, I was friends with Margaret Thatcher.
[01:51:23.926 --> 01:51:26.049]  She kept the pound out of the euro.
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:30.802]  When they tried to get it in, that blew up and Soros became famous.
[01:51:30.922 --> 01:51:33.744]  I mean, all these things I've been in the middle of.
[01:51:34.204 --> 01:51:39.307]  And it's always been foreign exchange has been the primary issue.
[01:51:39.487 --> 01:51:42.149]  And when they were creating the euro, they came to us.
[01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:45.591]  I told them if they don't consolidate the debts, it's going to collapse.
[01:51:46.483 --> 01:51:50.206]  And they said, look, we just have to get the euro in first, and we'll worry about the next thing.
[01:51:50.226 --> 01:51:52.288]  And now they admit, so what's the first to collapse?
[01:51:52.748 --> 01:51:53.469]  Is it the euro?
[01:51:53.549 --> 01:51:54.189]  Is it China?
[01:51:54.209 --> 01:51:55.631]  Because the ruble's way up.
[01:51:55.811 --> 01:51:58.433]  I mean, what's the most, is it the dollar?
[01:51:58.533 --> 01:51:59.454]  I mean, how do you see this?
[01:51:59.694 --> 01:52:05.719]  I know it's hard to make a prediction, but... The dollar's the last to fall, because it's going to be like World War I and II.
[01:52:06.459 --> 01:52:07.600]  All the money comes here.
[01:52:08.401 --> 01:52:08.721]  All right?
[01:52:08.741 --> 01:52:12.704]  Because Europe's, you know, you got tanks going down the streets, blowing up things.
[01:52:13.285 --> 01:52:15.907]  That's what the strength in the dollar has been.
[01:52:17.033 --> 01:52:20.215]  It's been capital inflows, a U.S.
[01:52:20.275 --> 01:52:21.535]  share market as well.
[01:52:22.176 --> 01:52:26.518]  I mean, pay attention to the Dow versus, for example, the Nasdaq.
[01:52:26.598 --> 01:52:28.559]  Nasdaq is retail domestic.
[01:52:28.599 --> 01:52:32.200]  The Dow is is the big money from international.
[01:52:33.121 --> 01:52:35.982]  It's like when the Japanese came over buying real estate.
[01:52:36.002 --> 01:52:40.524]  You know, what do they they bought all the trophies, you know, Rockefeller Center, et cetera.
[01:52:40.885 --> 01:52:43.646]  They don't buy mom and pop houses down the street from you.
[01:52:44.903 --> 01:52:49.126]  So it's, you know, the Dow represents big international capital.
[01:52:49.567 --> 01:52:55.831]  And first you have the concentration of capital into the United States from Europe and Asia.
[01:52:55.851 --> 01:53:03.496]  And then eventually, you know, as all these countries start defaulting on their debt, they're going to turn and say, well, the U.S.
[01:53:03.536 --> 01:53:04.397]  has got to be next.
[01:53:05.317 --> 01:53:05.918]  So the U.S.
[01:53:05.938 --> 01:53:07.379]  will be the last to fall.
[01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:22.977]  And that's why they got Biden in there, because he'll sign basically anything that... And as you said, they're getting ready for the Euro to be the first big one to drop, but they want a big bailout with their Marshall Fund 2.0.
[01:53:25.124 --> 01:53:26.245]  Pretty much, yes.
[01:53:26.345 --> 01:53:35.132]  I mean, you have Zelensky over there who's telling, he got Biden mad, he's basically saying he wants the U.S.
[01:53:35.152 --> 01:53:36.413]  to cover all their pensions.
[01:53:37.414 --> 01:53:38.615]  We don't even cover ours.
[01:53:39.435 --> 01:53:43.959]  I mean, it's, you know, the whole thing is falling apart.
[01:53:45.760 --> 01:53:48.022]  How does FTX going belly up tie to this?
[01:53:50.547 --> 01:53:56.610]  They, you know, they were basically funding, they were the second largest donator to the Democrats.
[01:53:57.130 --> 01:54:01.111]  He was basically funding the fake studies for COVID.
[01:54:02.212 --> 01:54:10.375]  And, you know, he just bought his way into the Democrats and thinking that he could, you know, buy protection.
[01:54:10.856 --> 01:54:19.299]   But, you know, they lost so much with the collapse in digital currencies that You know, it's, you know, there it goes.
[01:54:19.399 --> 01:54:23.740]  I mean, and you're getting a contagion now in other areas.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:32.902]  So the good old fashioned things is basically, you know, cash, some medals, things of that nature, and you keep them in your drawer for right now.
[01:54:32.962 --> 01:54:35.023]  But U.S.
[01:54:35.083 --> 01:54:40.244]  dollars, I should point out that 70% of the dollars circulate outside the country.
[01:54:40.851 --> 01:54:41.551]  Because the U.S.
[01:54:41.591 --> 01:54:47.254]  has been the only country that doesn't cancel its currency, whereas Britain cancels it.
[01:54:47.274 --> 01:54:49.755]  You have a £10 note from 20 years ago.
[01:54:49.775 --> 01:54:50.455]  They're worthless.
[01:54:51.236 --> 01:54:52.796]  The same thing in Europe.
[01:54:52.876 --> 01:54:55.117]  I mean, they cancel currencies routinely.
[01:54:55.537 --> 01:55:01.200]  Canada passed a law and he canceled all the high currencies in January.
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:04.441]  So this is, you know, the U.S.
[01:55:04.721 --> 01:55:07.963]  is the dollar has been the reserve currency.
[01:55:09.125 --> 01:55:13.029]  And it's also been used primarily outside the country.
[01:55:13.129 --> 01:55:16.012]  I mean, dollars are circulating tremendously in Russia.
[01:55:16.112 --> 01:55:26.723]  So in closing, and I really appreciate your time, other big predictions, politically in America, the war in Russia, just quick, quick synopses if you can.
[01:55:26.743 --> 01:55:29.926]  Well, you know, this is an election that nobody's going to accept.
[01:55:31.769 --> 01:55:39.051]  Our computer warned that it was probably the most corrupt election, I think, in American history.
[01:55:39.691 --> 01:55:43.872]  But it really calls into question what's going to happen in 2024.
[01:55:44.072 --> 01:55:52.074]  And I'm not necessarily sure we're even going to have a viable election at that point.
[01:55:53.812 --> 01:56:00.761]  Like Stalin said, you know, anybody can vote whoever they want, but it's those that count are the ones that decide the election.
[01:56:01.502 --> 01:56:03.465]  And, you know, he wasn't so far off.
[01:56:04.446 --> 01:56:09.392]  You know, you have to understand that we're probably still in a very steep recession.
[01:56:11.585 --> 01:56:14.186]  Interest rates are still going to rise into next year.
[01:56:14.806 --> 01:56:17.007]  So you're looking at mortgage rates going up.
[01:56:17.207 --> 01:56:20.248]  I wouldn't pay off mortgages if you have them at low rates.
[01:56:20.348 --> 01:56:24.789]  I would, you know, basically keep it because that's the risk you've sold to somebody else.
[01:56:25.489 --> 01:56:36.193]  And I would definitely make sure you have a supply of some food because the supply chain has been really seriously disrupted.
[01:56:38.549 --> 01:56:50.617]  Energy, I mean, you should have at least some sort of a backup if possible, because these people are trying to shut down the entire power grids, really, with what they're doing.
[01:56:50.777 --> 01:56:52.077]  And they don't even understand.
[01:56:52.098 --> 01:56:57.221]  I mean, you had Biden, as soon as he came in, the first thing he did was cut off the pipeline from Canada.
[01:56:58.381 --> 01:57:00.222]  Then he outlaws all drilling.
[01:57:00.563 --> 01:57:03.424]  Yet then he goes over to Saudi Arabia before the election.
[01:57:03.444 --> 01:57:05.986]  And please don't cut off anything before the election.
[01:57:06.026 --> 01:57:07.667]  We don't care what you do afterwards.
[01:57:08.246 --> 01:57:11.789]  But, you know, these people are completely insane.
[01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:22.797]  If everybody had electric cars, the power grid, the most conservative estimate I've ever seen, it has to be 400 times larger than what it is now.
[01:57:24.223 --> 01:57:25.284]  Incredibly said.
[01:57:25.344 --> 01:57:33.510]  I know you've got to go, but if you could do five more minutes, a two-minute break, I just want you to continue what you're doing now, because I want you to just lay it out, because they are insane.
[01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:34.851]  They're collapsing things.
[01:57:35.311 --> 01:57:37.994]  They admit they want a post-industrial world, but they're going to get the blame.
[01:57:38.454 --> 01:57:42.617]  How do we stop them from completely collapsing things, and then get new leadership and stop this?
[01:57:42.637 --> 01:57:44.018]  Because that's the big question.
[01:57:44.699 --> 01:57:46.060]  Five more minutes with us, Mr. Armstrong.
[01:57:46.080 --> 01:57:47.141]  We'll come right back to you.

[02:00:01.788 --> 02:00:04.367]  (upbeat music)
[02:00:04.367 --> 02:00:08.387]  All right, final segment with Owen Troyer.
[02:00:08.504 --> 02:00:13.310]  Doing a great job laying out these races and what's unfolding.
[02:00:13.350 --> 02:00:16.454]  Mike Lindell with huge news coming up here in just a moment.
[02:00:17.916 --> 02:00:19.458]  Other key points you'd like to add, Owen?
[02:00:21.414 --> 02:00:24.738]  Well, I'll tell you what I'm going to be talking about in the war room.
[02:00:24.758 --> 02:00:26.240]  Because here's what I'm seeing.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:31.948]  There's the DeSantis-Trump debate that's obviously raging and people are kind of picking sides right now.
[02:00:32.348 --> 02:00:32.789]  That's alright.
[02:00:32.809 --> 02:00:36.554]  I think mostly people are getting ahead of themselves and it's a politically charged season.
[02:00:37.114 --> 02:00:49.557]   I think the real And I think the real movement I'm seeing here that needs to be focused on is the removal of power from the McRepublicans, McConnell, McCarthy, and McDaniel.
[02:00:49.877 --> 02:00:50.477]  They're an ouster.
[02:00:50.517 --> 02:00:51.497]  It's time for them to go.
[02:00:51.797 --> 02:00:54.799]  You already have Republicans that just won re-elections calling for it.
[02:00:54.919 --> 02:00:59.140]  It's pretty much wide swept across the media, conservative media.
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:01.401]  They don't want this Republican leadership anymore.
[02:01:01.421 --> 02:01:02.681]  They're not happy with the results.
[02:01:02.701 --> 02:01:04.382]  They believe Republicans should have done much better.
[02:01:04.802 --> 02:01:07.023]  So that's a consensus right now.
[02:01:07.743 --> 02:01:17.294]  In the Republican voter base, in the populist movement that is trying to take over the Republican Party from the establishment and the Uniparty, that the McOuster needs to happen.
[02:01:17.334 --> 02:01:21.258]  McDaniel, McCarthy, and McConnell have got to go.
[02:01:21.719 --> 02:01:33.791]   And so we're going to see how that develops, but I think there's going to be enough of an initiative and a charge With this 218th Congress, that you might actually see a position change in those positions.
[02:01:34.151 --> 02:01:34.612]  And good!
[02:01:34.912 --> 02:01:45.962]  The Republican Party has such great talent and such great potential coming up through it, it'd be ridiculous to keep these people around who don't energize the party or reach out to the young or the cities at all.
[02:01:46.303 --> 02:01:48.104]  So that's going to be a great thing.
[02:01:48.965 --> 02:01:53.189]  That's going to come from this, no matter how the numbers shake out in Congress at the end of the day.
[02:01:53.629 --> 02:01:59.555]  Now here's another big, maybe not big, kind of a side issue that I'm seeing, and that's the Libertarian vote.
[02:02:00.156 --> 02:02:05.020]  In a lot of these races, Georgia might be your best example, but I think Pennsylvania, it was the same case.
[02:02:05.441 --> 02:02:07.643]  The Libertarian vote was more than enough.
[02:02:07.882 --> 02:02:11.882]   to if you would give all the votes it would always put the Republican ahead.
[02:02:11.882 --> 02:02:13.882]   But I don't even think they would need all the Libertarian vote.
[02:02:13.882 --> 02:02:16.882]   I think they would really just need 90% of the Libertarian vote.
[02:02:16.882 --> 02:02:21.882]   And I believe it would have put Oz ahead and it definitely would have given Walker the majority
[02:02:21.882 --> 02:02:23.882]  and he would have won the Senate.
[02:02:23.882 --> 02:02:28.882]   And so I understand, I'm not going to get into the Libertarian bashing game here.
[02:02:28.865 --> 02:02:30.666]  I understand why Libertarians exist.
[02:02:31.387 --> 02:02:35.811]  I understand why they have a disposition towards the Republican and the Democrat Party.
[02:02:36.271 --> 02:02:40.555]  And I understand why you vote third party and why you keep a third party out there.
[02:02:41.156 --> 02:02:47.101]  But I think that Libertarians are not being fully honest with themselves after the results of this election.
[02:02:47.742 --> 02:02:57.490]   Because if you don't see how you have a real power here, Because they say, oh well, I don't want to vote for the two corrupt parties, or I don't want to vote for this person or that person.
[02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:59.431]  Well, how about I put it to you this way.
[02:02:59.491 --> 02:03:03.353]  Let me give the Libertarians a pitch here, because I'm not a Republican, I'm an Independent.
[02:03:04.082 --> 02:03:09.443]  But let me give the Libertarians a push here of why, a pitch of why they should be moving their votes to Republican.
[02:03:09.743 --> 02:03:12.024]  Do you want to vote for the Democrat that's going to take your gun?
[02:03:12.584 --> 02:03:14.284]  Or do you want to vote for the Republican that's not?
[02:03:14.304 --> 02:03:16.364]  I mean, do I really have to say anything else?
[02:03:17.345 --> 02:03:25.246]  And here's the classy way to do it, and this is what happened in Arizona, Alex, and I don't know if it's going to be enough to put Masters ahead, but they still have their fingers crossed.
[02:03:25.566 --> 02:03:31.227]  The Libertarian candidate in Arizona bowed out about a week or two before the election and endorsed Blake Masters.
[02:03:31.528 --> 02:03:33.568]  That's what the Libertarians need to do at this point.
[02:03:34.505 --> 02:03:39.329]  Your vote can change a Senate seat in Pennsylvania.
[02:03:39.409 --> 02:03:42.472]  Your vote can change a Senate seat in Georgia.
[02:03:42.672 --> 02:03:45.274]  I understand you don't like the Republican Party.
[02:03:45.434 --> 02:03:46.095]  I get it.
[02:03:46.675 --> 02:03:47.255]  I get it.
[02:03:47.856 --> 02:03:57.164]   But if you don't see the power in what you can do now, just by endorsing the candidate that's not going to take your guns, Hopefully not raise your taxes, but I get it.
[02:03:57.204 --> 02:03:58.124]  Republicans do that too.
[02:03:58.465 --> 02:04:01.247]  But just on the issue of guns, I mean, isn't it easy enough?
[02:04:01.287 --> 02:04:02.328]  I mean, isn't that clear enough?
[02:04:02.608 --> 02:04:04.230]  Do you want to be disarmed or not?
[02:04:04.630 --> 02:04:09.975]  So that's another issue that I kind of see as a side hors d'oeuvre, Alex, that people are going to be talking about.
[02:04:09.995 --> 02:04:12.757]  But these are the big issues that I see that we're going to be covering on The War Room.
[02:04:12.977 --> 02:04:16.601]  I'm looking forward to hearing from Mike Lindell with these ridiculous numbers.
[02:04:16.861 --> 02:04:18.542]  It's the exact same playbook they ran in 2020.
[02:04:19.423 --> 02:04:20.324]  Well, let's do this, Owen.
[02:04:20.404 --> 02:04:24.526]  I know you've got to get ready for your own show at 3 today, but Mike Lindell's giving us the whole hour.
[02:04:24.546 --> 02:04:28.848]  I know you'll have some great questions and great analysis, so you get your big board ready in there.
[02:04:29.409 --> 02:04:35.492]  And then at the bottom of the hour, we'll have you pop in with some comments, analysis, and any questions for Mike Lindell.
[02:04:35.512 --> 02:04:36.553]  And then you'll be back at 3 p.m.
[02:04:36.573 --> 02:04:39.854]  Central with The War Room and InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[02:04:39.874 --> 02:04:40.355]  That sound good?
[02:04:41.212 --> 02:04:41.432]  All right.

[02:04:46.738 --> 02:04:50.042]  We're treading water here, but we're still in the fight just like America is.
[02:04:50.062 --> 02:04:50.783]  We're not going to give up.
[02:04:51.964 --> 02:04:52.204]  All right.
[02:04:52.224 --> 02:04:53.506]  We'll be right back with Mike Lindell.

[02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:06.359]  (upbeat music)
[02:06:06.359 --> 02:06:14.980]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:15.370 --> 02:06:20.433]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:24.369 --> 02:06:28.990]  People think I'm like an octopus with eight arms, trying to fight the new world order with everything I got.
[02:06:29.410 --> 02:06:30.410]  Punch up Mike Lindell.
[02:06:30.670 --> 02:06:34.051]  I mean, even during the break, the guy is like directing five different people to do five different things.
[02:06:34.831 --> 02:06:35.571]  Just amazing.
[02:06:36.011 --> 02:06:39.652]  And he was dead on about election fraud, and now he's built the organization to expose it.
[02:06:40.252 --> 02:06:42.732]  And he's joined us for the full hour here.
[02:06:43.432 --> 02:06:45.013]  And I went and checked the data he put out.
[02:06:45.073 --> 02:06:45.833]  It's dead on.
[02:06:45.893 --> 02:06:46.993]  He was the first to put it out.
[02:06:47.553 --> 02:06:49.454]  And it's just been on top of his amazing team.
[02:06:49.974 --> 02:06:51.434]  We have things like Fetterman.
[02:06:52.742 --> 02:07:08.105]  With these crime spikes, as Mike Lindell has coined here, with these crime spikes, we have all of this happening, and then we have votes being taken away from Fetterman, because they obviously added too many to it.
[02:07:08.345 --> 02:07:16.987]  But I want to say something before we play a short compilation of some of the highlights of their election coverage, and we go right to the great guy himself, Mike Lindell, there on screen.
[02:07:17.528 --> 02:07:19.108]  We're in a fight against the New World Order.

[02:09:00.222 --> 02:09:05.247]  He'll tell you all about it before he leaves us in like 50 minutes, but I wanted to play a compilation.
[02:09:05.267 --> 02:09:06.528]  He was asking me before he went live.
[02:09:07.068 --> 02:09:09.090]  Right during the break he said, did you see our coverage?
[02:09:09.110 --> 02:09:10.752]  I said, well of course I was watching, everybody is.
[02:09:10.992 --> 02:09:11.933]  You've done the best job.
[02:09:12.173 --> 02:09:12.854]  You've nailed it.
[02:09:13.054 --> 02:09:16.077]  And he said, did you see my crime spikes and live time crime?
[02:09:16.117 --> 02:09:16.697]  I said, of course.
[02:09:17.078 --> 02:09:19.600]  I've got a compilation of some of the best of it.
[02:09:19.780 --> 02:09:21.882]  We'll air a few minutes of it and go to the man.
[02:09:22.123 --> 02:09:23.084]  Mike Lindell, here it is.
[02:09:23.624 --> 02:09:25.985]  What we have here, we have the votes going up.
[02:09:26.045 --> 02:09:27.185]  I'm putting my cursor over it.
[02:09:27.245 --> 02:09:29.465]  Votes going up, staying the same, staying the same.
[02:09:29.485 --> 02:09:35.487]  And then we have, we go from 326,000 votes down to 288,000 votes.
[02:09:36.167 --> 02:09:37.147]  So, where'd they go?
[02:09:37.667 --> 02:09:38.087]  They're gone.
[02:09:38.447 --> 02:09:40.228]  You can't go and reverse everybody.
[02:09:40.268 --> 02:09:45.769]  These are the order, these votes are coming in through the Edison Report, which is one of the biggest monopolies in this country.
[02:09:46.269 --> 02:09:50.530]  Every single vote goes through New Jersey, and then it comes out to us.
[02:09:51.350 --> 02:09:57.954]  I switched over, while you were talking, to the governor race in Pennsylvania, and you'll see it happened there too.
[02:09:58.374 --> 02:10:12.481]  We have a 63,000, we have a 90,000 crime spike, another 90,000 crime spike, a 63,000 crime spike, and then they go, uh oh, the whole world's gonna know that Mastriano's getting, you know, we're cheating by too much.
[02:10:12.521 --> 02:10:13.622]  So what do they do, everybody?
[02:10:13.682 --> 02:10:14.963]  Right there, point to the cursor?
[02:10:15.443 --> 02:10:19.325]  They took away 90,000 votes from the Democrat.
[02:10:20.185 --> 02:10:25.520]  Yeah, if you look, it took the vote total back to where it had been way back here.
[02:10:26.022 --> 02:10:27.987]  These are real-time crime spikes!
[02:10:28.772 --> 02:10:30.332]  Machine manipulation?
[02:10:30.832 --> 02:10:31.313]  Look at that!
[02:10:31.733 --> 02:10:33.413]  See that Democrat going, ding!
[02:10:33.773 --> 02:10:37.514]  Up 150,000 votes because Herschel was taking the lead.
[02:10:37.814 --> 02:10:40.634]  So they just dumped a bunch of votes by computer in there.
[02:10:41.074 --> 02:10:42.615]  Everybody can understand that.
[02:10:42.635 --> 02:10:45.715]  That's something everybody can enjoy, real-time crime.
[02:10:45.755 --> 02:10:47.896]  That's right there in front of ya!
[02:10:47.916 --> 02:10:51.796]  That's 100,000 votes that comes out of nowhere.
[02:10:52.637 --> 02:10:53.957]  That's just not real.
[02:10:54.648 --> 02:10:59.109]  If you took that real spike out, that crime spike, Herschel would be up by 150,000 votes.
[02:10:59.150 --> 02:11:05.712]  Yeah, it looks like about 100,000 votes spike there, if I'm reading that correctly.
[02:11:05.852 --> 02:11:09.913]  Out of nowhere, yes, that one, for Gretchen Widmer.
[02:11:11.674 --> 02:11:15.375]  That has all the indications of a vote dump.
[02:11:16.776 --> 02:11:19.257]  Uh, of likely counterfeit ballots.
[02:11:20.398 --> 02:11:24.541]  Both of these look really, really strange, but in particular... Yeah, this one.
[02:11:24.781 --> 02:11:28.604]  Yeah, that one... Because there was almost hardly any increase in the... Yeah.
[02:11:29.104 --> 02:11:32.767]  That's 22-23, so that's 10-23 p.m.
[02:11:32.867 --> 02:11:34.929]  Eastern Time, if I'm reading that correctly.
[02:11:34.949 --> 02:11:35.149]  Correct.
[02:11:35.749 --> 02:11:40.553]  And so, that is almost beyond belief.
[02:11:41.013 --> 02:11:43.096]  Wow, look at this everybody!
[02:11:43.577 --> 02:11:46.781]  That's a million votes up and a million votes down.
[02:11:48.022 --> 02:11:52.889]  You know, a million votes here and a million votes there and eventually it adds up to a real, you know, real election.
[02:11:52.909 --> 02:11:54.131]  Can you explain this one?
[02:11:55.166 --> 02:11:56.067]  Can you explain this?
[02:11:56.327 --> 02:11:58.249]  Well, I can't really explain it.
[02:11:58.269 --> 02:12:00.851]  I mean, I can't... There is no explanation.
[02:12:00.871 --> 02:12:08.258]  There is no explanation, but you see that you had an update at Eastern Time, what is that, 1042, of about a million votes for...
[02:12:12.222 --> 02:12:15.645]  Duckworth, and pretty much none for the other person.
[02:12:16.046 --> 02:12:18.548]  And then you see, it wasn't like it was something that came right back.
[02:12:18.608 --> 02:12:26.036]  It's like we kept on having little more updates, little more updates, and then suddenly there goes the million votes back down again.
[02:12:26.472 --> 02:12:29.073]  That million person spike there.
[02:12:29.073 --> 02:12:32.672]   We're going to have more of these highlights in the hour, but I got to get to the man himself,
[02:12:32.672 --> 02:12:34.172]  Mike Lindell.
[02:12:34.172 --> 02:12:36.773]  Wow. Incredible time to be alive.
[02:12:36.773 --> 02:12:38.872]   We only got four minutes to break. We'll come back. You'll have the floor.
[02:12:38.872 --> 02:12:43.273]   But just a snapshot to hear the guy literally at the heart of the fight against these people.
[02:12:43.273 --> 02:12:46.073]  What is really going on, Mike Lindell?
[02:12:46.073 --> 02:12:51.273]   About what they're doing is the same thing that they did in the 2020 election and in the primaries, by the way.
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:52.720]  What they do is they poll.
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:58.022]  That's why we told everybody to vote same day and don't vote early or with the mail and all this stuff.
[02:12:58.322 --> 02:12:59.542]  They're just pulling names.
[02:12:59.922 --> 02:13:05.124]  The computer just pulls names and you get these injections of votes.
[02:13:05.184 --> 02:13:07.084]  So let's use the Os race.
[02:13:09.666 --> 02:13:14.771]  You know, with Fetterman, they did 590,000 vote injections.
[02:13:15.112 --> 02:13:16.814]  So as soon as it gets close, boom, boom.
[02:13:17.094 --> 02:13:28.787]  Now once it's the day of votes, like we're seeing down in Arizona right now, all these day of votes come in, and those votes aren't as corrupted, or might not be at all.
[02:13:29.327 --> 02:13:33.229]  But this is what's happening, and we have to get rid of the machines.
[02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:43.575]  And this time, though, the miracle, everybody, I want to tell everyone the miracle is that when I woke up on Election Day, I'm going, I'm hearing from 32 states.
[02:13:43.635 --> 02:13:50.958]  Remember, I have people in 50 states, Alex, and all 50 states, we have a massive amount of people on the ground.
[02:13:51.499 --> 02:13:55.881]  And it was reported in 32 of the states, machine malfunctioning.
[02:13:56.421 --> 02:14:02.545]  Just like Arizona, which made national news and international news, that they weren't even accepting ballots.
[02:14:02.885 --> 02:14:03.805]  People were getting there.
[02:14:03.825 --> 02:14:05.626]  They're going, oh, you've already voted.
[02:14:05.846 --> 02:14:07.747]  You pull out your little mail-in ballots.
[02:14:07.807 --> 02:14:08.648]  And no, I haven't.
[02:14:08.928 --> 02:14:10.689]  They called their sheriff's departments.
[02:14:11.049 --> 02:14:18.653]  So right away, the awareness that was made around the world about these machines, that was like a divine intervention.
[02:14:18.673 --> 02:14:19.754]  That was a gift from God.
[02:14:20.154 --> 02:14:23.556]  And then now we're seeing what goes on inside the machines.
[02:14:24.356 --> 02:14:32.665]  And we overrun the algorithms, I believe, so far in at least nine races, but obviously we have all the evidence now of all the ones they sold.
[02:14:32.685 --> 02:14:36.730]  They decimated Colorado, Michigan, Pennsylvania.
[02:14:36.990 --> 02:14:38.231]  They just took it all.
[02:14:38.251 --> 02:14:40.414]  They weren't even shy about it this time around.
[02:14:42.079 --> 02:14:49.584]  What's incredible is, even Tucker Carlson, that hasn't really looked at the fraud, now he agrees with you and says they clearly stole it.
[02:14:49.624 --> 02:14:51.025]  So, congratulations.
[02:14:51.065 --> 02:14:54.247]  Nobody deserves more credit than you and your supporters and our supporters.
[02:14:54.267 --> 02:14:55.528]  Because, Mike, you've been through hell.
[02:14:56.289 --> 02:14:56.929]  And you're a winner.
[02:14:56.949 --> 02:14:57.870]  You don't complain about it.
[02:14:58.090 --> 02:14:59.791]  But, buddy, you've been raided by the FBI.
[02:14:59.811 --> 02:15:00.391]  You've been attacked.
[02:15:00.511 --> 02:15:01.512]  You've been deplatformed.
[02:15:01.852 --> 02:15:04.354]  You have been savage, but you seem stronger for it.
[02:15:05.362 --> 02:15:07.884]  Yeah, well, you know, it's my faith in God.
[02:15:07.904 --> 02:15:11.226]  And I'll tell you, Alex, we don't want to be Venezuela.
[02:15:11.586 --> 02:15:15.789]  And we got a perfect example right before this election of what they did to Brazil.
[02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:19.991]  5.1 million votes were stolen from that great President Barsanaro.
[02:15:20.532 --> 02:15:25.235]  And you've seen all the millions of people out there going, this can't be, this can't be.
[02:15:25.735 --> 02:15:26.376]  But you know what?
[02:15:26.416 --> 02:15:28.497]  The mainstream media didn't even cover that.
[02:15:29.210 --> 02:15:30.231]  So you are right.
[02:15:30.371 --> 02:15:36.716]  I am so happy right now that Tucker and other news outlets actually started covering this.
[02:15:37.096 --> 02:15:49.705]  If they start covering the real-time crime and start covering these things, we're going to get there a lot faster to this beautiful place we're going than we could ever think that we'd get there that fast.
[02:15:49.725 --> 02:15:50.826]  All right, Mike Lindell.
[02:15:50.906 --> 02:15:52.748]  Mike Lindell, truly the man in the arena.
[02:15:52.788 --> 02:15:58.332]  I'm going to come back and give you the floor to get into everything because you are, again, absolutely on target.
[02:16:00.174 --> 02:16:34.319]   The tip of the spear throughout this entire process, the only thing that made any Republican victories tonight possible, the only thing that made any resistance to the war machine possible, the only thing that made any opposition to the lockdowns and the mask mandates and the school shutdowns and the forced vaccines and the dangerous drugs possible, What made any resistance to it possible was people continuing to support InfoWars despite the massive lawfare being waged against InfoWars, despite the media defamatory, libelous campaign against InfoWars.
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:49.408]  The ordinary people, the everyday people that buy products that make their own lives healthier, wealthier and wiser is what keeps InfoWars on the air and what that does is keep the populist message alive in an era and an age of totalitarian oppression.
[02:16:49.568 --> 02:16:51.131]  So continue to do it.
[02:16:51.231 --> 02:16:53.355]  Go to places like InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:16:53.416 --> 02:16:55.179]  Go to the places like Save InfoWars.

[02:20:02.655 --> 02:20:06.655]  a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:06.810 --> 02:20:08.810]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:08.810 --> 02:20:15.810]   I think what Mike Lindell said earlier in the last segment on The Alex Jones Show is
[02:20:15.810 --> 02:20:18.810]  so central.
[02:20:18.961 --> 02:20:27.727]  If we hadn't had all the poll watchers, if we hadn't had the massive resistance exposing the fraud, it would have been far worse and we wouldn't even have a shot at the House or the Senate.
[02:20:28.287 --> 02:20:29.228]  But we're on the march.
[02:20:29.888 --> 02:20:33.631]  The vote stealers and their crime spikes are on the run.
[02:20:34.151 --> 02:20:36.533]  And so Mike, you are the encyclopedia on this.
[02:20:37.173 --> 02:20:45.900]  I'm going to try for the rest of the hour to give you the floor to just go through what happened, what's happening currently, what you see coming next and how we're going to peacefully expose this.
[02:20:47.081 --> 02:20:49.283]  Well, we have breaking news just on break here.
[02:20:49.343 --> 02:20:51.385]  I got a I got a text from our lawyers.
[02:20:51.825 --> 02:21:05.277]  I don't know if everybody knew out there, but there was a company CEO called Koenig out of Michigan that got charged with probably the biggest larna data breach in United States history.
[02:21:06.056 --> 02:21:19.219]  Which was during, in our elections, going, and this is out of China everybody, which I've been saying all along, that the CCP combined with the United Party, the Globalists, and the Deep State, this is the attack, this is who's attacking our country.
[02:21:19.559 --> 02:21:21.840]  The Democrat Party just loves to join on in.
[02:21:21.860 --> 02:21:27.641]  Now let me tell you, they just dropped the charges against Koenig.
[02:21:28.461 --> 02:21:30.082]  They're against this CEO.
[02:21:30.502 --> 02:21:31.602]  It's disgusting.
[02:21:32.062 --> 02:21:34.763]  Now you think that China isn't involved in our government?
[02:21:35.323 --> 02:21:38.844]  It's absolutely disgusting what they just happened.
[02:21:39.624 --> 02:21:48.387]  And it says that their office, they took out a press release saying they didn't rely on True2Vote's data, that they did their own investigation.
[02:21:48.407 --> 02:21:49.607]  Lie!
[02:21:49.967 --> 02:21:52.988]  Remember, they put the True2Vote, Catherine and Greg, in jail.
[02:21:53.448 --> 02:21:55.829]  They put them in jail for almost, what, a week?
[02:21:57.240 --> 02:21:58.741]  And that's important to add.
[02:21:58.801 --> 02:21:59.742]  You're getting SWAT teamed.
[02:21:59.762 --> 02:22:03.044]  People are being thrown in jail as you're exposing this and being vindicated.
[02:22:03.344 --> 02:22:08.767]  That's why people need to be praying for you and everybody that's supporting what you're doing, including InfoWars, because folks, you want us to fight.
[02:22:08.947 --> 02:22:09.448]  We're doing it.
[02:22:09.568 --> 02:22:09.928]  Continue.
[02:22:11.129 --> 02:22:14.130]  Yep, you guys are awesome, everybody, with your support.
[02:22:14.570 --> 02:22:15.990]  So this is what we're up against.
[02:22:16.030 --> 02:22:18.390]  But I will tell you some other lawsuits.
[02:22:18.470 --> 02:22:25.091]  There's over 45 lawsuits going on in this country right now that we're fighting for in every state and we're adding to it today.
[02:22:25.692 --> 02:22:27.172]  We have one in Arizona.
[02:22:27.472 --> 02:22:28.892]  I'll give you Arizona here.
[02:22:28.912 --> 02:22:36.914]  We appealed, we just appealed to deny, remember they denied Cochise County in Arizona.
[02:22:37.174 --> 02:22:39.214]  They told them they couldn't hand count the election.
[02:22:39.898 --> 02:22:40.539]  What?
[02:22:40.919 --> 02:22:41.279]  Why?
[02:22:41.539 --> 02:22:45.422]  Why would you come in there and say, and get a ruling from a corrupt judge or something?
[02:22:45.482 --> 02:22:46.003]  I don't know.
[02:22:47.124 --> 02:22:48.745]  He ruled that you can't do a hand count.
[02:22:48.765 --> 02:22:51.747]  Well, we appealed that to the Arizona Supreme Court.
[02:22:51.787 --> 02:22:52.928]  We'll see what comes of that.
[02:22:53.769 --> 02:22:55.950]  Over in Wisconsin, let's move over to Wisconsin.
[02:22:56.591 --> 02:22:58.552]  There, you won't even believe this one.
[02:22:58.592 --> 02:23:00.514]  This is the complaint.
[02:23:01.198 --> 02:23:04.139]  That's compiled against the WEC.
[02:23:04.159 --> 02:23:07.121]  This is the Crooked Wisconsin Election Commission.
[02:23:07.281 --> 02:23:07.601]  Okay?
[02:23:08.101 --> 02:23:10.062]  The Crooked Wisconsin Election Commission.
[02:23:10.662 --> 02:23:20.167]  And there, there's been two-way communication between tabulators that goes out to an unofficial address.
[02:23:20.227 --> 02:23:22.268]  It's called WISCNET.NET.
[02:23:22.608 --> 02:23:24.929]  It goes to this foundation called WISCNET.NET.
[02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:34.244]  And all of our stuff, all the Wisconsin elections and our stuff across the country is going to these guys.
[02:23:34.484 --> 02:23:36.265]  Then it goes out from there all over the place.
[02:23:36.766 --> 02:23:41.229]  So we put a complaint in there, a lawsuit in there, get to the bottom of it.
[02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:43.891]  And I just want everybody to know there's hope everywhere.
[02:23:44.912 --> 02:23:48.155]  And now that we're going to get the House, I believe we'll get the House and the Senate.
[02:23:48.235 --> 02:23:53.339]  I believe right now you've got the stuff going on, which I can tell you about in a minute, an update on that.
[02:23:53.899 --> 02:24:02.694]   But to slow the destruction of our country, But in the meantime, the big smoking gun is getting rid of these electronic computers and voting machines.
[02:24:03.235 --> 02:24:05.700]  We have to get down to elections, not selections.
[02:24:08.194 --> 02:24:25.064]  We've got, there's just so much hope out there, but I know if you're in Michigan or you woke up, you're Michigan, Colorado, Pennsylvania, so many of them have lost hope now, Alex, because they were just decimated by the stolen election, by these elections that were stolen.
[02:24:25.424 --> 02:24:27.645]  But let me tell you, I'll give an example.
[02:24:27.665 --> 02:24:43.894]   Our cyber guys were watching, do you know in Pennsylvania and with Georgia, The same attacks, some of the same IP addresses that did this in 2020 and in a couple of the primaries came from the same place.
[02:24:44.654 --> 02:24:51.960]  So we're getting deeper and deeper into that and there's just so much hope in this country right now.
[02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:53.301]  I'm happy.
[02:24:53.341 --> 02:24:54.942]  I want to say this to everybody too.
[02:24:56.223 --> 02:24:59.205]  Everyone goes, well Mike, we didn't get the red wave we wanted.
[02:24:59.918 --> 02:25:01.999]  You guys, that's a miracle we didn't get that.
[02:25:02.679 --> 02:25:05.400]  We are so blessed that we didn't get that, and here's why.
[02:25:06.220 --> 02:25:12.783]  If we'd have got this big red wave, if I'd have been there, Marcus, I'd have said, don't do anything stupid with the machines.
[02:25:13.123 --> 02:25:17.464]  Let's let this go, and we can take the country later.
[02:25:17.805 --> 02:25:18.565]  They're on to us.
[02:25:19.298 --> 02:25:22.259]  If it had been a big red wave, you know what they would have said to people like me?
[02:25:22.299 --> 02:25:28.160]  They would have said, Mike, it's okay to have all these mail-in ballots from the China virus and all this garbage.
[02:25:28.701 --> 02:25:31.421]  Two months of early voting like my home state of Minnesota.
[02:25:31.661 --> 02:25:32.802]  Mike, it's all okay.
[02:25:32.822 --> 02:25:34.762]  The machines, look at the Republicans won.
[02:25:35.563 --> 02:25:37.123]  This isn't about that, everybody.
[02:25:38.770 --> 02:25:43.571]  The UNA party was there, the CCP, this is what was taking our country.
[02:25:43.651 --> 02:25:46.712]  Over 50 countries have been taken by the machines.
[02:25:47.132 --> 02:25:49.432]  There's my own governor's race, look at this.
[02:25:51.252 --> 02:25:53.833]  He lives in my hometown, Scott Jensen.
[02:25:54.953 --> 02:25:57.334]  Right out of the gate, they just dumped it on Walz.
[02:25:57.354 --> 02:25:59.754]  They gave him a quarter million votes, extra votes.
[02:25:59.994 --> 02:26:00.894]  Here you go, Walz.
[02:26:01.294 --> 02:26:02.554]  And look at that, all the way up.
[02:26:02.754 --> 02:26:04.135]  I mean, it's disgusting.
[02:26:04.595 --> 02:26:05.375]  They stole it.
[02:26:06.027 --> 02:26:08.308]  You know, and this went on across our country.
[02:26:08.608 --> 02:26:11.889]  This is machine manipulation, everybody, and computers.
[02:26:12.389 --> 02:26:14.030]  We cannot have computers.
[02:26:14.330 --> 02:26:15.671]  We're at an apex in history.
[02:26:15.711 --> 02:26:23.053]  We get one chance, one chance for our freedoms to be back and to save our country.
[02:26:25.555 --> 02:26:27.715]  I want to tell you, look at this, look at here in Michigan.
[02:26:27.995 --> 02:26:31.416]  This is when I went to bed on election night, 2 in the morning.
[02:26:31.816 --> 02:26:38.597]  This happened at 1, about 12.58, might have been a little after 1 o'clock in the morning, the traditional Michigan dump.
[02:26:39.057 --> 02:26:41.738]  Look what they gave to Nestle.
[02:26:42.158 --> 02:26:51.160]  They gave Nestle, I think it was 200,000 or more than that, votes, and just took Matt DiPerno's dream and everyone's dream, boom, gone.
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:53.400]  That's the Attorney General of Michigan, everybody.
[02:26:54.096 --> 02:26:55.677]  They stole it in real time!
[02:26:56.278 --> 02:27:00.582]  Mike, the graph says it gave them 300,000 plus votes.
[02:27:00.602 --> 02:27:03.104]  300,000 plus votes instantly.
[02:27:04.085 --> 02:27:04.686]  Instantly!
[02:27:04.706 --> 02:27:05.847]  You guys, this came down.
[02:27:06.087 --> 02:27:11.692]  And let me tell you, I'm going to tell you how similar it was to the 2020 election in Michigan.
[02:27:12.276 --> 02:27:13.578]  When they stopped everything.
[02:27:13.818 --> 02:27:16.321]  And by the way, isn't it weird that they stopped everything in 2020?
[02:27:17.342 --> 02:27:18.724]  All the states at the same time?
[02:27:18.744 --> 02:27:20.526]  You think there's not some communication there?
[02:27:20.827 --> 02:27:21.408]  Shut her down!
[02:27:21.428 --> 02:27:22.269]  We got a problem!
[02:27:22.549 --> 02:27:27.055]  Donald Trump's gonna win all these states anyway because he's overrunning the algorithms!
[02:27:27.737 --> 02:27:52.015]  Well, let me tell you, in Michigan, when 106,000 votes came down for Biden at two in the morning in Michigan, and 3,000 for Donald Trump, and everyone said to us, the big lie was, well, you know, those darn inner city, those darn votes from, you know, the Democrats all voted, you know, for those mail-in votes, those darn mail-in votes.
[02:27:52.315 --> 02:28:09.611]   Well, let me tell you, If Fox News or any other news outlet that we had at that time had grown to trust, if they'd have got on there and said, hey everybody, the mail-in votes in Michigan were counted on the morning of the 3rd, not in the middle of the night on the 4th.
[02:28:10.092 --> 02:28:12.193]  Everyone has said, well then where'd they come from?
[02:28:12.814 --> 02:28:18.158]  I'll tell you where they came from, a big white van that pulled in and three fobs and a download of 106,000 votes for Biden.
[02:28:20.419 --> 02:28:22.040]  So this went on again.
[02:28:22.901 --> 02:28:24.202]  Everyone needs to understand.
[02:28:24.642 --> 02:28:27.564]  The same input is going to give you the same output.
[02:28:28.064 --> 02:28:30.626]  We were getting boiled like frogs for two decades.
[02:28:30.926 --> 02:28:33.427]  The Democrats even warned against these machines.
[02:28:33.788 --> 02:28:37.770]  But now that they're on the right side of a fixed game, they don't care.
[02:28:38.170 --> 02:28:39.491]  There it is in Michigan.
[02:28:39.511 --> 02:28:40.712]  It brings back memories.
[02:28:41.392 --> 02:28:42.113]  All the memories.
[02:28:42.493 --> 02:28:43.714]  There they come.
[02:28:43.754 --> 02:28:46.075]  Let's drop 106,000 votes for Biden in the middle of the night.
[02:28:47.629 --> 02:28:50.173]  And, um, which brings up another point.
[02:28:50.454 --> 02:28:52.277]  Remember... Michael and Bill, stay there.
[02:28:52.297 --> 02:28:53.178]  You'll have the floor.
[02:28:53.219 --> 02:28:54.060]  You're on fire.
[02:28:54.360 --> 02:28:58.728]  When we come back on the other side of this break, we'll continue to run the entire field here.
[02:29:00.896 --> 02:29:02.739]  Calling Patriots worldwide.

[02:30:48.855 --> 02:30:57.760]  Help launch this war on information to the next level by purchasing one or more of these high-quality items at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:00.782 --> 02:31:10.328]  You know, yesterday, somewhere here in my stack, I covered the Rainbow Dildo Butt Monkey.
[02:31:11.980 --> 02:31:15.042]  And I saw comments and things and people thinking I made that up.
[02:31:15.563 --> 02:31:16.744]  I didn't read half of it.
[02:31:17.104 --> 02:31:27.432]  The man had a fake penis on with a fake butt naked with a fake vagina hanging down like a turkey gobbler and fake women's breasts.
[02:31:27.512 --> 02:31:28.693]  I wouldn't even show it on air.
[02:31:29.133 --> 02:31:33.116]  And little kids came up and sat on the dildo at the library.
[02:31:34.110 --> 02:31:36.653]  So, you see, it's worse than what I just told you.
[02:31:37.293 --> 02:31:38.375]  You want me to show it to you?
[02:31:38.555 --> 02:31:40.096]  Our TV stations will take us off air.
[02:31:40.437 --> 02:31:41.918]  It's not fit for adults to see.
[02:31:42.038 --> 02:31:43.820]  It's only good for five-year-olds!
[02:31:44.761 --> 02:31:48.265]  You think they're funding that on purpose because they're playing freaking games?
[02:31:50.047 --> 02:31:51.849]  These people ain't playing games!
[02:31:52.049 --> 02:31:53.451]  They're gonna kill everybody!
[02:31:55.582 --> 02:31:56.542]  I want them shut down.
[02:31:56.602 --> 02:31:57.403]  I want them silent.
[02:31:57.483 --> 02:31:58.203]  I want them muted.
[02:31:58.243 --> 02:32:00.063]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:32:00.383 --> 02:32:02.284]  Thanksgiving 2022 is here.
[02:32:02.644 --> 02:32:04.944]  We've got the biggest sale of the year going right now.
[02:32:05.284 --> 02:32:10.686]  Now, the good news is I'm going to extend this sale up to 60% off right through Christmas.
[02:32:11.086 --> 02:32:15.307]  The bad news is by Christmas, almost every product in the store will be sold out.
[02:32:15.587 --> 02:32:17.328]  We won't get more for months and months and months.
[02:32:17.688 --> 02:32:21.889]  So now is the time to take action to support the Info War and get the biggest sales of the year.
[02:32:22.109 --> 02:32:27.791]  We've already sold out of X2 and X3 and BioTruth Selenium and our Wake Up America award-winning coffee.
[02:32:28.071 --> 02:32:32.232]  And now, DNA Force Plus, Vitamin Refusion, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:32:33.252 --> 02:32:38.376]  So many other great products like Ultimate Crystal Oil, Ultimate Finish Oil, Vazo Beats, Secret 12.
[02:32:39.097 --> 02:32:43.040]  They are all going to sell out in the next few weeks or in the next month.
[02:32:43.420 --> 02:32:45.582]  Again, more stuff is going to sell out today.
[02:32:46.003 --> 02:32:49.766]  So every hour you wait, more stuff will be sold out at infowarestore.com.
[02:32:50.346 --> 02:32:56.871]  Promo code 1776 and you get an additional 10% off the already giant savings at infowarestore.com.

[02:32:58.352 --> 02:32:58.773]  God bless.
[02:33:02.222 --> 02:33:06.324]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:06.643 --> 02:33:08.643]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:08.643 --> 02:33:18.643]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[02:33:18.643 --> 02:33:19.643]  Liberty.
[02:33:19.689 --> 02:33:21.190]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:22.951 --> 02:33:24.691]  Our jobs have been shipped overseas.
[02:33:24.711 --> 02:33:25.912]  We've been de-industrialized.
[02:33:25.932 --> 02:33:28.893]  They've cut our power supplies off to bankrupt us and get us under their control.
[02:33:29.413 --> 02:33:30.994]  We're trying to pay Americans not to work.
[02:33:32.162 --> 02:33:50.951]  And if you read different documents that came out from the Clinton National Library a few years ago, when World Daily soon got the documents, when they first got into office in 93, they were obsessed with killing the US economy to control Americans, and to kill any populist or conservative media that could create its own ecosystem.
[02:33:51.351 --> 02:33:52.772]  That's why Infowars is so precious.
[02:33:52.852 --> 02:34:03.756]   And Mike Lindell is just a great entrepreneur and a made-in-America patriot that solved problems and literally just Solved the history that was taking place and stood up for everybody.
[02:34:04.937 --> 02:34:08.101]  That's why it's so critical to understand, to fight a war takes money.
[02:34:09.301 --> 02:34:13.124]  So if you just donated to myself or Mike Lindell, and we're fighting hard, that's a good thing.
[02:34:13.164 --> 02:34:22.771]  But with Mike, you get the great products made in America, it's employees in America, and then he's a fearless fighter, and he's a sponsor of InfoWars A Win-Win.
[02:34:23.071 --> 02:34:24.793]  So go to MyPillow.com.
[02:34:24.833 --> 02:34:26.214]  He's not even asking me to do this, but I'm going to do it.
[02:34:26.774 --> 02:34:30.097]  Because we need to sell these great products, and we need the funds, and you need them.
[02:34:31.058 --> 02:34:32.658]  These are high quality products.
[02:34:32.779 --> 02:34:33.679]  Hundreds and hundreds of them.

[02:34:34.999 --> 02:34:38.300]  And then Mike puts almost all the money towards the fight against the tyrants.
[02:34:38.700 --> 02:34:39.220]  So do we.
[02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:40.881]  So go to MyPillow.com.

[02:35:47.522 --> 02:35:48.584]  You've got so much to cover.
[02:35:48.864 --> 02:35:50.666]  The current race is what you think is coming next.
[02:35:51.106 --> 02:35:54.089]  As you said, we've been in the boiling water for 20, 30 years.
[02:35:54.410 --> 02:35:57.113]  This all seems horrible, but really, this is our awakening.
[02:35:57.433 --> 02:35:58.394]  This is our victory.
[02:35:58.414 --> 02:36:00.296]  And it's got the deep state very, very scared.

[02:36:02.970 --> 02:36:04.671]  First, I want to do a correction, Alex.
[02:36:05.351 --> 02:36:09.332]  A lot of the stuff on MyPillow, you can't make here in the U.S.
[02:36:09.352 --> 02:36:13.014]  Like my Giza Dream Sheets, they don't have any weavers or spinners left.

[02:36:57.244 --> 02:36:58.105]  A lot of it at MyPillow is.
[02:36:58.125 --> 02:37:01.587]  I don't know if the geezer sheets are grown there and sewn there, but a lot of it is put together here.
[02:37:01.607 --> 02:37:06.430]  The point is, you're a major employer of the American people and you're battling the globalists at point-blank range.
[02:37:06.771 --> 02:37:09.292]  MyStore.com, promo code Alex.
[02:37:09.312 --> 02:37:10.093]  Getting back to the election.
[02:37:11.164 --> 02:37:12.065]  Yep, absolutely.
[02:37:12.085 --> 02:37:16.168]  And I'm going to tell everybody, I'm going to give everybody a little hope here too.
[02:37:16.248 --> 02:37:26.036]  I was down in Florida and when I was there for the hurricanes, we were giving out pillows and blankets, my pillows, and we went into this Hispanic community.
[02:37:26.676 --> 02:37:27.757]  They lost everything.
[02:37:27.797 --> 02:37:31.620]  They're piled up, all their physical stuff piled up like cordwood and it's gone.
[02:37:32.461 --> 02:37:35.083]  And a lot of them, we had to have an interpreter.
[02:37:35.183 --> 02:37:36.604]  And you know what they were saying?
[02:37:37.484 --> 02:37:43.168]  Almost unanimously, all of them were saying, Mike, is there this stuff going on in this country?
[02:37:43.188 --> 02:37:45.069]  Is there hope?
[02:37:45.249 --> 02:37:45.930]  Is there hope?
[02:37:46.370 --> 02:37:48.611]  They were worried about our future, Alex.
[02:37:48.932 --> 02:37:50.492]  Their freedoms that they have here.
[02:37:50.753 --> 02:37:55.576]  They had just lost everything physical, but they know they're not going to get those physical things back.
[02:37:55.636 --> 02:37:57.417]  If we lose all our freedoms, it's over.
[02:37:58.098 --> 02:37:59.619]  And that's what we've been fighting for.
[02:37:59.739 --> 02:38:02.061]  And that's what we we are winning everybody.
[02:38:02.541 --> 02:38:05.643]  And I want to tell everybody just to give a couple updates here.
[02:38:06.383 --> 02:38:08.525]  You've got going down in Arizona right now.
[02:38:08.545 --> 02:38:10.426]  Everyone says, are we going to get the Senate?
[02:38:11.226 --> 02:38:11.927]  I believe we are.
[02:38:12.027 --> 02:38:15.369]  We've got Carrie Lake, Blake and Mark Fincham.
[02:38:15.829 --> 02:38:18.511]  They're all, they're counting the same day votes now.
[02:38:18.811 --> 02:38:19.912]  Carrie Lake's only down by 13,000.
[02:38:20.232 --> 02:38:26.256]  She went down by a quarter million when they were doing the cheating ones, all the mail-in and all the early voting.
[02:38:26.696 --> 02:38:28.378]  And they're overtaking the algorithms.
[02:38:28.558 --> 02:38:31.660]  Everybody, they are overtaking the algorithms.
[02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:33.601]  All three of them, I believe, will win.
[02:38:33.641 --> 02:38:34.482]  Carrie, for sure, 100%.
[02:38:34.782 --> 02:38:36.203]  By the way, that's key.
[02:38:36.243 --> 02:38:42.447]  For folks who don't know what overpowering the algorithm means is, a giant red wave, they can't stop it completely.
[02:38:42.487 --> 02:38:45.529]  Explain what overpowering or overtaking the algorithm means.
[02:38:45.929 --> 02:38:52.934]  Right, so when you have the computers, when you're using computers and you set them, you set them to steal.
[02:38:53.295 --> 02:38:58.038]  So let's say, just like our great president, real president Donald Trump in 2020.
[02:38:58.078 --> 02:38:59.559]  They had these set.
[02:38:59.599 --> 02:39:01.941]  You have to have a base to begin with.
[02:39:01.981 --> 02:39:08.666]  You have to, you know, kind of do a prediction of what you think it will be, of how many votes will come in on the day of.
[02:39:09.247 --> 02:39:12.189]  And now you're taking, you can't make it look so obvious.
[02:39:12.669 --> 02:39:16.615]  You know, you can't make it look obvious, otherwise everyone would go, hey, there's a problem here.
[02:39:17.917 --> 02:39:24.346]  But when they do that, so they can only steal so much from a Cary Lake, like down there in Arizona.
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:29.661]  And I'll give you a perfect example where the primaries were Kerry Lake.
[02:39:29.902 --> 02:39:31.562]  We told everybody to vote day of.
[02:39:31.922 --> 02:39:35.324]  Kerry Lake, remember, she was down by 10%, 11 o'clock at night.
[02:39:35.784 --> 02:39:38.665]  Then they started counting the day of votes in the primary.
[02:39:38.685 --> 02:39:40.266]  Remember, this was months ago.
[02:39:40.286 --> 02:39:45.568]  And she caught up and she was only down by 12, or up, then she was up by 12,000 votes.
[02:39:45.948 --> 02:39:47.369]  So what did Maricopa County do?
[02:39:47.629 --> 02:39:53.131]  They put the, they stopped the machine, stopped the counting, put the covers over the windows, put the fence up again.
[02:39:53.511 --> 02:39:54.972]  And we waited three days.
[02:39:55.692 --> 02:40:03.322]  Until they find there's nothing they could do because there was 90,000 votes left and the same day was coming in 75 carry 25 the opponent.
[02:40:03.723 --> 02:40:05.245]  So they had to give it to carry.
[02:40:05.605 --> 02:40:07.868]  It's identical to what's going on right now.
[02:40:08.109 --> 02:40:14.959]   is about four hundred thousand votes left and carry like so it down by thirteen all the votes coming
[02:40:14.959 --> 02:40:17.708]   in for blake mark and carry
[02:40:17.708 --> 02:40:21.689]   are are coming in at eighty percent eighty twenty club
[02:40:21.689 --> 02:40:25.167]   so they're all going to have a little bit of a character when for sure
[02:40:25.167 --> 02:40:32.248]   and this is going on in other races to in nevada jim r_ shot down the other the other side
[02:40:32.248 --> 02:40:36.047]   a senator that's there that's running for senate I can't think of the name right now.
[02:40:36.468 --> 02:40:37.308]  I got a mind block.
[02:40:37.608 --> 02:40:39.809]  But he's going to probably win.
[02:40:39.849 --> 02:40:42.069]  That gives us the Senate control, the Senate.
[02:40:42.930 --> 02:40:50.112]  And if it does, if just one of them win, if just Blake comes in, then we got to go to Herschel Walker for that runoff, which Herschel won going away.
[02:40:50.132 --> 02:40:52.233]  But they stole it, made it a runoff.
[02:40:52.953 --> 02:40:56.674]  And then also Lauren Boebert in Colorado.
[02:40:57.014 --> 02:40:58.555]  She's only down by 30 votes now.
[02:40:59.535 --> 02:41:04.798]  And so, what I mean, everybody, these are the real votes coming in, the day of votes.
[02:41:04.838 --> 02:41:08.899]  So, they overtook, they beat the machine steel, so to speak.
[02:41:09.340 --> 02:41:11.060]  Whatever they set, okay?
[02:41:11.341 --> 02:41:14.282]  It's pretty hard for them to do dumps, you know?
[02:41:15.228 --> 02:41:18.550]  Yeah, we got to pray that Lauren, because she would be the bright spot of Colorado.
[02:41:18.871 --> 02:41:21.312]  They took everything in Colorado, everybody.
[02:41:21.653 --> 02:41:22.653]  They stole it all.
[02:41:22.673 --> 02:41:26.116]  Yeah, that just means she had such a landslide, she beat the algorithm if she wins.
[02:41:26.436 --> 02:41:29.538]  In fact, I've been watching today, she's been in the lead off and on.
[02:41:29.578 --> 02:41:32.901]  So this is like a buy-a-nose horse race right now.
[02:41:33.822 --> 02:41:35.102]  Right, right.
[02:41:35.363 --> 02:41:40.359]   It's kind of like, I mean, And by the way, I'm going to tell everybody this too.
[02:41:40.679 --> 02:41:47.904]  Realize the candidates, the ones that they have taken, most of them out there aren't going to concede.
[02:41:48.304 --> 02:41:53.427]  They have more rights, you think, than to do audits, and they won't be able to kick them out for standing.
[02:41:53.888 --> 02:42:00.692]  So I believe what's going to happen, Alex, we're going to get the House and Senate, I believe, control, and that'll slow the destruction.
[02:42:01.072 --> 02:42:04.595]  And we're going to get this country back by the judges, everybody.
[02:42:05.175 --> 02:42:13.579]  We've got so many sheriffs out there that are going to be bringing all the evidence of what happened in this election to the judges and cases and court cases.
[02:42:13.959 --> 02:42:25.165]  Remember, no judge in the United States has looked at any evidence from 2020, or for that matter, any of these elections, even in the primaries, because they kicked the can on something called standing.
[02:42:25.465 --> 02:42:28.186]  It's just an easy way for a judge to say, I don't want to see that.
[02:42:28.866 --> 02:42:30.267]  We've got to pray for our judges.
[02:42:30.327 --> 02:42:39.890]   If you know a judge out there, And your family or your friend is a judge, just encourage them to say, just have courage to be the judge that God put you here to be.
[02:42:40.230 --> 02:42:40.890]  Be a judge!
[02:42:40.910 --> 02:42:47.031]  Here's an example, it's like the district attorney Frank Garrison exposed the whole Kennedy thing because one district attorney did the right thing.
[02:42:47.051 --> 02:42:48.432]  That's why Soros has been trying to buy him off.
[02:42:48.511 --> 02:42:54.011]   We come back, what's coming next, other big developments, your deep research from two years ago.

[02:45:00.848 --> 02:45:07.452]  In the modern world, where they convince a woman to get a job, the man to get a job, they inflate the currency so nobody can exist any other way because it's too expensive.
[02:45:07.733 --> 02:45:09.134]  The parents are out working all day.
[02:45:09.294 --> 02:45:12.056]  The school and the internet and the matrix raise your children.
[02:45:12.076 --> 02:45:15.378]  Your children go to school all day and be told things that you may not want them to learn.
[02:45:15.518 --> 02:45:18.880]  Then they sit on the internet and read things and watch things you may not want them to watch.
[02:45:18.900 --> 02:45:21.382]  You talk to them for 10 minutes at the end of the day, they go to bed.
[02:45:21.422 --> 02:45:28.446]  You're fighting with your 10 minutes against endless hours of the most entertaining programming or the most forceful programming.
[02:45:28.487 --> 02:45:29.427]  In school, it's forceful.
[02:45:29.687 --> 02:45:30.688]  On the internet, it's entertaining.
[02:45:30.968 --> 02:45:33.491]  Convincing them of ideas that you perhaps don't agree with.
[02:45:33.811 --> 02:45:35.012]  I've seen it myself on YouTube.
[02:45:35.032 --> 02:45:39.497]  I've seen a guy in America driving his car and his kids were in the back seat and he was arguing with them about an issue.
[02:45:39.998 --> 02:45:41.199]  And they was like, where did you hear that?
[02:45:41.459 --> 02:45:41.759]  School?
[02:45:41.960 --> 02:45:43.441]  He's like, why did the school tell you that?
[02:45:43.461 --> 02:45:43.942]  That's not true.
[02:45:43.982 --> 02:45:47.005]  And his own children are arguing with him because they learned it in school.
[02:45:47.145 --> 02:45:48.506]  Have you ever tried to take your children out of school?
[02:45:48.706 --> 02:45:49.246]  You'll get fined.
[02:45:49.266 --> 02:45:49.906]  You'll get in trouble.
[02:45:49.946 --> 02:45:51.167]  No, your kids have to go to school.
[02:45:51.307 --> 02:45:52.908]  You have to give your kids away to the school.
[02:45:53.168 --> 02:45:56.150]  If you don't give your kids away to the brainwashing, you'll get in trouble.
[02:45:56.530 --> 02:46:03.834]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker, and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has truly earned the title of Top G.
[02:46:04.534 --> 02:46:08.175]  But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged the globalists.
[02:46:08.555 --> 02:46:13.696]  He is consecutively the most googled man in the world in the last two years.
[02:46:13.976 --> 02:46:18.578]  And that's because his message is about human and specifically male empowerment.
[02:46:19.058 --> 02:46:24.799]  Now, Andrew Tate is taking his fight to empower and supercharge men to the next level.

[02:46:50.816 --> 02:46:59.800]   I think there's a whole bunch of men in the world who understands my value and if men grow up to be like me, you're gonna have a whole bunch of people with no criminal record, dedicated athletes, who protect and provide for the people close to them.
[02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:09.800]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:09.800 --> 02:47:18.359]   Yeah, okay, so with that being said, with the exposure, once that's lifted, now this
[02:47:18.359 --> 02:47:20.040]  should get rid of all the lawfare?
[02:47:20.037 --> 02:47:21.958]  It'll get rid of the lawfare.
[02:47:21.998 --> 02:47:22.778]  It'll get rid of this.
[02:47:22.978 --> 02:47:26.320]  Remember, lawfare has not been used in our country since 1798.
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:28.621]  It's horrible what they did.
[02:47:28.921 --> 02:47:29.821]  And who started that?
[02:47:30.202 --> 02:47:31.242]  Smartmatic did.
[02:47:31.562 --> 02:47:39.926]  When Smartmatic sued Fox News on February 4th of 2021, our voices got silent because Fox wouldn't talk.
[02:47:40.266 --> 02:47:44.868]  Nobody will have anybody on to talk about the election crime, including 2,000 meals.
[02:47:45.128 --> 02:47:46.469]  And that wasn't even machines.
[02:47:46.989 --> 02:47:50.211]  So you had, you got your Newsmax's of the world, your Fox's of the world.
[02:47:50.491 --> 02:47:55.613]  Well, no, they can't talk about election crime or machines or anything like that.
[02:47:55.893 --> 02:47:56.854]  It's disgusting.
[02:47:57.254 --> 02:48:00.475]  And then, so they, they are either afraid of being sued.
[02:48:00.796 --> 02:48:03.557]  Well, once you sued Fox News, everybody was afraid, right?
[02:48:04.057 --> 02:48:20.611]  And, uh, which, uh, that's a whole nother story about Fox News, but, but anyway, so this law fair, now, and all these lawsuits, remember, these machine companies, and one of them rhymes with the word dominion, they've sued over 200 people or sent them threatening letters.
[02:48:20.951 --> 02:48:23.853]  A lot of these citizens had to go get home security systems.
[02:48:24.053 --> 02:48:25.995]  These were like mafia letters sent to them.
[02:48:26.375 --> 02:48:37.246]  Well, these citizens, like nobody hears about in Michigan, like these citizens did a class action lawsuit against Dominion with Alan Dershowitz, one of the lawyers, and going, hey, this is wrong.
[02:48:37.266 --> 02:48:38.147]  You can't do this.
[02:48:38.487 --> 02:48:39.428]  We did nothing wrong.
[02:48:39.468 --> 02:48:40.429]  Nobody's done anything wrong.
[02:48:40.650 --> 02:48:43.593]  We're speaking out against something that everybody's seen and knows.
[02:48:44.173 --> 02:48:55.808]  And so what's happening, Mike Lindell, because even last week before the election, Politico and a bunch of others wrote articles admitting machines are hackable and are being hacked and saying everything you said, everything I've been reporting for 28 years.
[02:48:55.928 --> 02:48:57.089]  I mean, so, so, so, so.
[02:48:57.189 --> 02:48:59.893]  Oh yeah, we're totally, totally vindicated, you guys.
[02:49:00.013 --> 02:49:01.335]  I did a, I was down at a...
[02:49:02.075 --> 02:49:07.621]  I was down at a Senate hearing down in Louisiana a couple months ago, and all the machine companies were there.
[02:49:08.002 --> 02:49:08.883]  Well, here's ES&S.
[02:49:08.923 --> 02:49:13.628]  They're one of the biggest ones in the country, if not the biggest, out of Omaha, Nebraska.
[02:49:13.988 --> 02:49:26.299]   One of their owners was there, and he comes up and he goes, The great Secretary of State, Kyle Ardenwein, asked him straight out, he said, are your machines hackable and vulnerable?
[02:49:26.519 --> 02:49:27.880]  And at least he didn't lie.
[02:49:27.940 --> 02:49:30.922]  He said, yes they are, but all machines are.
[02:49:31.382 --> 02:49:32.483]  All voting machines are.
[02:49:32.964 --> 02:49:33.544]  End quote.
[02:49:33.984 --> 02:49:39.969]  And then, with these guys, with these guys, they tried to paint themselves that they're not Dominion and Smartmatic.
[02:49:40.149 --> 02:49:45.974]  We're the hometown boys from Omaha, Nebraska, but our parts are made in China.
[02:49:46.554 --> 02:49:47.234]  Our software.
[02:49:47.514 --> 02:49:48.695]  It's all the same software.
[02:49:49.215 --> 02:49:50.135]  It's all corruption.
[02:49:50.615 --> 02:49:52.916]  And then, Alex, you'll like this.
[02:49:52.956 --> 02:49:55.076]  So they let me talk for 24 minutes.
[02:49:55.677 --> 02:50:06.059]  And the one gal up there at the committee, she says, Mr. Lindell, in our state here, we'd rather not use paper to save the trees and stuff.
[02:50:06.099 --> 02:50:09.000]  I said, well, ma'am, we're going to recycle too.
[02:50:09.420 --> 02:50:12.961]  We're going to take these machines, melt them down, and turn them into prison bars.
[02:50:13.482 --> 02:50:14.002]  End quote.
[02:50:15.382 --> 02:50:16.022]  I love it.
[02:50:16.182 --> 02:50:19.164]  I want to bring Owen Troyer in here and hit a bunch of other key points you've got.
[02:50:19.184 --> 02:50:21.004]  We're very blessed to have you for the full hour.
[02:50:21.064 --> 02:50:25.846]  Owen Troyer has been our election expert here, been following your work, and he's got a few questions and comments.
[02:50:26.146 --> 02:50:27.647]  Owen Troyer on the air with Mike Lindell.
[02:50:28.888 --> 02:50:34.634]  Yeah, Mike, you're doing such great work monitoring all of these races and all the trends going on across the country.
[02:50:34.654 --> 02:50:36.296]  It's really an amazing team you've assembled.
[02:50:36.336 --> 02:50:46.586]  But I'm curious, what are you noticing in these inner cities like Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, and San Francisco, where Democrats are getting 70, 80, sometimes 90 percent of the vote?
[02:50:49.469 --> 02:50:51.132]  What do you think the story there is?
[02:50:51.172 --> 02:50:54.377]  I mean, are Democrats really that popular in the cities they destroyed?
[02:50:54.718 --> 02:51:03.592]  Or is your team noticing maybe some shenanigans that are getting these huge numbers for Democrats that end up in Senate races overwhelming the state's desires?
[02:51:04.707 --> 02:51:07.871]  Right, well, all you have to do is look at Florida.
[02:51:08.192 --> 02:51:15.221]  Like I said earlier in the show, Florida, they put in stuff there to at least slow the steel to a crawl.
[02:51:15.742 --> 02:51:23.045]   And you just had a governor there, I mean, and get Windade County, which hadn't been won in decades, I guess.
[02:51:23.045 --> 02:51:27.886]   So if you look at that's what it really would be like without machine manipulation or somewhat,
[02:51:27.886 --> 02:51:32.245]   because remember they still have a machine, but they put things in place where they couldn't pull names.
[02:51:32.245 --> 02:51:37.246]   So when you talk what you're saying there, no, they're just blatantly because, oh, it's inner city.
[02:51:37.246 --> 02:51:41.966]   They've, the propaganda to the people is, oh, they're all gonna vote Democrat.
[02:51:41.966 --> 02:51:49.566]   No, I was out in California for a week about two months ago, and you could all look it up, Mike Lindell, California,
[02:51:49.628 --> 02:51:55.891]  And I was in a town, they were all very Democrat and liberal, and the average age was probably 30.
[02:51:56.211 --> 02:51:59.573]  But they all came up to me, all of them were friendly and they were concerned.
[02:51:59.774 --> 02:52:01.254]  Their gas was $7.30.
[02:52:02.215 --> 02:52:04.236]  They weren't going to vote Democrat anymore.
[02:52:04.276 --> 02:52:08.179]  By the way, Mike, that's what I've seen where I live, with liberals that are awake now.
[02:52:08.858 --> 02:52:13.058]   the CNN exit polls predicted a mass Republican victory because 70 plus percent of Democrats
[02:52:13.058 --> 02:52:15.638]  said we blame Biden, we're going to vote Republican.
[02:52:15.638 --> 02:52:20.858]   But the exit polls now are completely wrong, though historically they've always been extremely
[02:52:20.858 --> 02:52:21.858]  accurate.
[02:52:21.858 --> 02:52:22.858]  So I think it's clear.
[02:52:22.858 --> 02:52:27.938]   Big city, deep blue, Democrat cities, Chicago's famous for it on record, you know, stealing
[02:52:27.938 --> 02:52:29.978]  it back in the 60s.
[02:52:29.978 --> 02:52:32.537]  They are engaged in massive fraud there.
[02:52:32.537 --> 02:52:37.618]   And I think they're just overdoing it in those areas to get up the overall averages for the
[02:52:37.618 --> 02:52:42.698]   rest of the state in these statewide and congressional and presidential elections.
[02:52:42.698 --> 02:52:43.198]  What do you think?
[02:52:43.198 --> 02:52:53.198]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:52:44.246 --> 02:52:45.027]  Well, absolutely.
[02:52:45.588 --> 02:52:46.870]  It's been ever the public.
[02:52:46.970 --> 02:52:53.679]  Remember, when they use these computers and stuff, they don't want to make a deviation seem too out of hand.
[02:52:53.919 --> 02:52:59.006]  Well, if you got the public convinced that everybody loves the inner city, they're all going to vote Democrat.
[02:52:59.446 --> 02:53:00.426]  That's a big lie.
[02:53:00.727 --> 02:53:01.987]  That is a big lie.
[02:53:02.307 --> 02:53:07.489]  Remember, in the 2020 election, the most votes sold against Donald Trump was California.
[02:53:07.869 --> 02:53:09.489]  Minimum 1.5 million.
[02:53:09.850 --> 02:53:14.791]  Second most in the country was Texas at 1 million, and third was Florida at 950,000.
[02:53:15.551 --> 02:53:22.894]  So, what they did, and you say, well, why would they take from a Republican state like Alabama or Ohio?
[02:53:23.414 --> 02:53:24.195]  Well, here's why.
[02:53:24.856 --> 02:53:26.258]  I'll give everybody an example.
[02:53:26.618 --> 02:53:33.887]  Let's say I told you that in my home state of Minnesota that Donald Trump won $2 million to Biden's $100,000.
[02:53:34.427 --> 02:53:37.511]  Everyone would say, um, that's a computer error.
[02:53:37.691 --> 02:53:38.893]  There's something wrong.
[02:53:39.571 --> 02:53:44.913]  So, you have to make it look, you have to boil the whole ocean, so to speak.
[02:53:45.313 --> 02:53:52.155]  So you can look at those inner cities and say, we can take more there because people will believe it's all Democrat.
[02:53:52.615 --> 02:54:01.698]  Or you can go to Republican area and say, it's so overwhelming, 80% is going to be Republican, that you go, hey, we can take 10% off the top there.
[02:54:02.018 --> 02:54:02.998]  It's like skimming.
[02:54:03.318 --> 02:54:06.999]  If you had a massive casino or something, you're skimming off the top.
[02:54:07.059 --> 02:54:07.640]  Perfectly said.
[02:54:09.312 --> 02:54:10.057]  Perfectly said.
[02:54:10.077 --> 02:54:11.325]  Owen, another question?
[02:54:12.830 --> 02:54:33.927]  Well Mike, we were all concerned in Nevada that it was going to be Clark County, that's Las Vegas, where the Democrats were going to be up to shenanigans and tricks and maybe that's how they were going to try to pull off an election victory in the Senate, but we've been watching Clark County and it really hasn't seemed too anomalous as far as the numbers coming in, but then overnight it was Reno!
[02:54:34.207 --> 02:54:45.179]   It was Washaw County that magically 60% of all the recent ballot dumps ...are coming in for the Democrat, Mostow, where it used to be 60% for Laxalt.
[02:54:45.399 --> 02:54:49.565]  Are you guys watching, uh, Washaw County, Nevada right now?
[02:54:49.625 --> 02:54:51.167]  Are you guys seeing these anomalies?
[02:54:51.207 --> 02:54:53.551]  Do you think that's where they're gonna try to steal this Senate seat?
[02:54:54.861 --> 02:55:00.945]  Well, I have not talked to him about Nevada, but I will say this.
[02:55:01.546 --> 02:55:05.588]  I think you need to look more of what votes are they counting.
[02:55:05.989 --> 02:55:08.610]  I believe they counted all the early votes.
[02:55:08.730 --> 02:55:16.676]  Remember, I said that's where most of the steel goes in these early voting and before the same day voting.
[02:55:17.096 --> 02:55:28.272]   So if they're counting in Nevada, I don't care if it's Clark County, Reno, wherever it is, if those people voted day of, I believe that you're going to have a big win in the Senate
[02:55:28.272 --> 02:55:28.643]  there.
[02:55:28.643 --> 02:55:30.643]  All right, Owen Schreier, great questions.
[02:55:30.643 --> 02:55:31.643]  Thank you so much.
[02:55:31.643 --> 02:55:35.643]   You'll be host of The War Room, 3 p.m. Central today, coming up in a few hours.
[02:55:35.643 --> 02:55:37.643]  Mike, we're almost out of time.
[02:55:37.643 --> 02:55:38.643]  Thank you for so much time.
[02:55:38.643 --> 02:55:43.643]   In 60 seconds, closing comments or any other key things you'd like to add.
[02:55:43.643 --> 02:55:46.643]  Yeah, I would just like to tell everyone, we are in it.
[02:55:46.643 --> 02:55:52.643]   It's absolutely awesome that the way things are just laid out here, from these little mini miracles.
[02:55:53.323 --> 02:56:00.990]  Remember, we had all this machine problems, malfunctioning across our whole country, which made national and international news.
[02:56:01.271 --> 02:56:04.294]  That's huge for what we have to do in the future to get rid of them.
[02:56:04.794 --> 02:56:09.738]  And then we had, we're gonna get the, we got the House, we're gonna get the Senate, I believe we're gonna get that.
[02:56:10.299 --> 02:56:15.843]  And then, you're gonna see Kerry Lake and all them, Kerry Lake and Mark Fincham win in Arizona.
[02:56:16.243 --> 02:56:17.264]  That's the gateway.
[02:56:17.484 --> 02:56:18.645]  That'll be the prototype.
[02:56:18.965 --> 02:56:24.370]  The first thing they're gonna do is say, we got these machines gotta go, and then it'll spread across our country.
[02:56:24.850 --> 02:56:30.715]  We're going to look back and we're going to say, when we get to this great place we're going, God had his hand in all of this.
[02:56:30.835 --> 02:56:41.683]  And if you look back, everything had to happen just the way it did, and with everybody having patience, because even the bad stuff is making people pour into the nonsense.
[02:56:41.783 --> 02:56:42.384]  Exactly.
[02:56:42.404 --> 02:56:44.385]  As long as we don't give up, they lose.
[02:56:44.445 --> 02:56:47.007]  And over time, we're out of the boiling frog pot.
[02:56:47.067 --> 02:56:49.108]  We're awake now, now we know we're under attack.
[02:56:49.108 --> 02:56:51.826]   We're getting stronger every day the longer we continue to fight.
[02:56:51.826 --> 02:56:55.967]   So again, people should go to mystore.com for all the great Made in America products,

[02:57:25.419 --> 02:57:26.099]  Keep the faith!
[02:57:26.639 --> 02:57:29.682]  Yeah, so I think we're turning... I mean, I think the worm's turning.
[02:57:29.722 --> 02:57:32.104]  I totally agree with you that we're awake now.
[02:57:32.224 --> 02:57:34.025]  And if you're awake, you're in a hellish situation.
[02:57:34.246 --> 02:57:34.866]  At least you're awake.
[02:57:35.246 --> 02:57:36.808]  All right, thank you so much, Mike Lindell.
[02:57:37.912 --> 02:57:38.272]  Thank you.
[02:57:38.312 --> 02:57:38.752]  There he goes.
[02:57:38.832 --> 02:57:42.634]  MyStore.com, promo code Alex, or MyPillow.com, promo code Alex.
[02:57:42.694 --> 02:57:43.435]  Thank you, Mike Lindell.
[02:57:43.735 --> 02:57:44.395]  We'll be right back.
[02:57:44.495 --> 02:57:47.215]   Owen's got a little bit of an update, then we're going to open the phones up the whole
[02:57:47.215 --> 02:57:48.215]  next hour.
[02:57:48.215 --> 02:57:55.094]   The Lavaroff Republic last night had said, "We are at war with NATO, NATO is at war with
[02:57:55.094 --> 02:57:58.094]   us, and this is going to escalate very quickly into a nuclear war."
[02:57:58.094 --> 02:58:02.615]   You'd think that would be bigger news, it's in some newspapers, but it's in the top straight
[02:58:02.615 --> 02:58:23.295]  four. That's a big deal.
[02:58:23.295 --> 02:58:33.295]  [MUSIC]
[02:58:33.295 --> 02:58:41.295]  In Europe and America, there's a growing feeling of hysteria.
[02:58:41.295 --> 02:58:49.294]   Conditioned to respond to all threats, and the rhetorical speeches of the Soviets.
[02:58:49.294 --> 02:58:57.294]   Mr. Khrushchev says we will bury you, and don't subscribe to this point of view.
[02:58:57.294 --> 02:59:01.294]  It'd be such an ignorant thing to do.
[02:59:01.294 --> 02:59:07.294]  It's the Russians' love, their children too.
[02:59:07.294 --> 02:59:15.294]   How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?
[02:59:15.851 --> 02:59:23.796]  There is no monopoly of common sense on either side of the political fence.
[02:59:23.856 --> 02:59:30.721]  We share the same biology, regardless of ideology.
[02:59:30.620 --> 02:59:40.940]   Don't you believe me when I say to you I hope the Russians love their children.
[02:59:40.940 --> 02:59:46.020]  Watch this video in its entirety right now at Band.Video.
[02:59:46.020 --> 02:59:51.740]  [Music]
[02:59:51.556 --> 02:59:56.056]   Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:59:56.056 --> 02:59:58.056]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:59:58.056 --> 03:00:09.056]  I'm not gonna sit here and take it anymore!
[03:00:09.440 --> 03:00:19.006]  The third difference which we see in the Fourth Industrial Revolution is the fact that the winners take it all.
[03:00:19.787 --> 03:00:26.031]  Contrary to the previous industrial revolutions, it's very difficult to copy.
[03:00:27.112 --> 03:00:31.788]   So if you are a first mover, You are the winners.
[03:00:32.728 --> 03:00:40.610]  And this will determine global competition on a national, but also on a business level to a large extent.
[03:00:41.230 --> 03:00:47.291]  And I hope in a not too hostile way in the coming years.
[03:00:47.971 --> 03:01:07.297]   It really is true in a social Darwinistic fashion that is, we present all this that's very accurate and documented, And the general public does not rally and awaken and say no and bring the perpetrators to justice, that really they've all been given ample warning and deserve what they get.
[03:01:07.837 --> 03:01:30.167]   And that's why the globalists target adults with deadly shots and assisted suicide and all the rest of it, because metaphysically in the natural law of the universe, if you can get somebody to hurt themselves out of their free will, even if you pretty much trick them, you still gotta give them a hint Then it doesn't come back on you metaphysically as bad.
[03:01:30.648 --> 03:01:58.489]   And what will happen to politics in your country in 20 years when somebody in San Francisco or in Beijing knows the entire medical and personal history of every politician, every judge, and every journalist in your country, including all those sexual escapades, All their mental weaknesses and all their corrupt dealings.
[03:01:59.690 --> 03:02:02.572]  Will it still be an independent country?
[03:02:03.413 --> 03:02:05.615]  Or will it become a data colony?
[03:02:06.395 --> 03:02:12.481]  When you have enough data, you don't need to send soldiers in order to control a country.
[03:02:13.646 --> 03:02:17.569]  So they're definitely involved in a spiritual alchemy, and they understand the laws of the universe.
[03:02:18.210 --> 03:02:30.180]  But when they cross the Rubicon of trying to euthanize children, trying to sterilize children, trying to wreck the brains of children, it commits an interdimensional crime.
[03:02:31.835 --> 03:02:35.538]  That God will not put up with and will destroy us.
[03:02:36.258 --> 03:02:42.203]  Originally it was pericarditis and I was then told just before Christmas actually it's perimyocarditis.
[03:02:42.783 --> 03:02:47.747]  So it's actually worse because I've got pericarditis and myocarditis damage.
[03:02:47.807 --> 03:02:54.632]  So I have scarring on three parts of my heart and still the lining and muscle of my heart has got the inflammation which constricts it.
[03:02:54.652 --> 03:02:56.053]  So that's when my heart rate goes up.
[03:02:56.393 --> 03:02:59.075]  That's what's constricting my heart and stopping me from breathing.
[03:02:59.615 --> 03:03:17.563]  And the other team we're fighting knows that, and that's why they try to get us to go along and sanction the killing of children, whether it be abortion, or assisted suicide, or transgenderism as a form of genetic suicide for the people that actually get sterilized.
[03:03:19.204 --> 03:03:23.226]  And so, they're trying to get us to lower our shields.
[03:03:24.389 --> 03:03:24.989]  Ourselves!
[03:03:25.730 --> 03:03:27.831]  The depopulationists dream.
[03:03:28.871 --> 03:03:32.033]  A 3D printed suicide machine.
[03:03:32.813 --> 03:03:35.334]  Or in other words, a modern day gas chamber.
[03:03:36.015 --> 03:03:41.497]  The Sarko capsule, a high tech death machine explicitly built for killing yourself, was just 3D printed.
[03:03:42.277 --> 03:03:49.401]  The Sarko capsule is being touted by depopulationists as a way to efficiently and effortlessly kill oneself.
[03:03:50.379 --> 03:03:54.501]  Amir Farsood has applied for medically assisted dying, known as MAID.
[03:03:54.921 --> 03:04:04.924]  He lives in constant agony due to a back injury, but has started the process for end of life because his rooming house is up for sale and he can't find anywhere else to live that he can afford.
[03:04:05.444 --> 03:04:10.426]  Once inside the pod, the user will have to start the fatal process themselves.
[03:04:11.107 --> 03:04:14.488]  They will have to press a button which will reduce internal oxygen levels.
[03:04:15.228 --> 03:04:20.372]  The pod, which is biodegradable, can then be detached to be used as a coffin.
[03:04:21.273 --> 03:04:33.382]  When a Canadian veteran picked up the phone and called Veterans Affairs Canada to get treatment for his combat-related PTSD and a traumatic brain injury, he expected help getting better and getting his life back.
[03:04:33.862 --> 03:04:39.967]  Instead, he got an unexpected and unwanted offer to help him end it through medically assisted death.
[03:04:40.543 --> 03:04:42.106]  This is all being done by design.
[03:04:42.446 --> 03:04:45.311]  Well, the globalists say they're destroying the country by design.
[03:04:45.670 --> 03:04:49.190]  This is a pro-death, pro-tyranny cult.
[03:04:49.190 --> 03:04:59.790]  [intro music]

[03:07:27.668 --> 03:07:28.809]  Matt Baker's a great guy.
[03:07:28.829 --> 03:07:30.350]  I've met him, hung out with him several times.
[03:07:30.750 --> 03:07:36.613]  He's been here to the studios, and he's got some of the very best viral rants at city council meetings.
[03:07:36.653 --> 03:07:37.634]  He was just in Maricopa County.
[03:07:37.654 --> 03:07:41.656]  We're going to be talking to him coming up here in just a moment.
[03:07:43.137 --> 03:07:48.660]  He'll be riding shotgun with us as we cover news throughout the hour.
[03:07:49.701 --> 03:07:51.682]  But let me just get this out right now.
[03:07:53.032 --> 03:07:59.334]  We are in a toe-to-toe war with the Globalists, with the New World Order, right now.
[03:08:00.254 --> 03:08:03.735]  And we can't take these people on without your support.
[03:08:03.795 --> 03:08:12.198]  I'm trying to find today's live show plug because I wrote some notes on it a little bit earlier, and of course, because I did that, I can't find it.
[03:08:12.238 --> 03:08:12.638]  Here it is.
[03:08:14.539 --> 03:08:15.419]  Because this is important.
[03:08:16.530 --> 03:08:18.311]  We are not funded by the New World Order.
[03:08:18.851 --> 03:08:20.131]  We are not funded by the globalists.
[03:08:20.631 --> 03:08:22.372]  We are funded by we the people.
[03:08:22.752 --> 03:08:23.473]  That means you.
[03:08:23.493 --> 03:08:30.215]  And if we're going to stop World War III, that'll turn our whole country and our world into this image of a nuked DC.
[03:08:30.775 --> 03:08:36.517]  Then we've got to mobilize and support and magnify the voices of truth out there.
[03:08:36.617 --> 03:08:47.934]   So, I announced Monday That we're going to extend the big sale that's going, the big mega sale, blowout sales, sellout sale.
[03:08:48.635 --> 03:08:53.039]  We're going to extend that until all the products sell out.
[03:08:55.350 --> 03:09:07.474]  Because we've got to get the funds in now to pay our legal and to stay on air and to do our appeals and not let them take us off air so we don't just roll over and die so they can have their big fake victory.

[03:09:39.295 --> 03:09:40.937]  We're about to sell out of Brain Force Plus.
[03:09:41.738 --> 03:09:45.802]  We have got most of these products about to sell out.
[03:09:45.862 --> 03:09:49.667]  Now, I can sit there and keep them a few months at full price and bring in money, but we need the funds now.

[03:10:02.960 --> 03:10:05.522]  When they're at full price, they're marked up 100 and something percent.
[03:10:05.762 --> 03:10:09.806]  When we're selling them at this price, they are very close to the break-even margin.

[03:11:31.138 --> 03:11:49.370]  Whether it's a school board, or whether it's a city council, or whether it's a state legislature, or whether it's a demonstration in Washington, the most effective place for the average person to get past the censors and to reach tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, if not millions, or tens of millions of people, as Matt Baker's done, is to go to these events.
[03:11:49.431 --> 03:12:00.609]   That's why in the last year and a half, the FBI went to the school boards and said, In a secret document, we want to come intimidate people not to come to these events because it's hurting us too politically.
[03:12:00.969 --> 03:12:14.462]  If conservatives or populists or nationalists ever figure it out and actually go take back peacefully their counties, their cities, their states, their school boards, their zoning boards are key.
[03:12:14.482 --> 03:12:16.264]  That's where Agenda 2030 is coming through.
[03:12:17.879 --> 03:12:29.307]  If that happens, and if people realize how easy it is to take over your local governments because what we're promoting is common sense and popular and based on common sense, it's game over!
[03:12:31.038 --> 03:12:38.321]  And so if you go to your city council, and maybe a thousand people are there, and maybe ten thousand see it on a local TV station, that's a big win.
[03:12:39.041 --> 03:12:42.202]  But most people that go give a good speech, reach a hundred thousand.
[03:12:42.762 --> 03:12:49.965]  And a lot of people, every day, I can't even keep track of it, I'll see dozens of videos, I've been looking, of a half million here, two million there, a million here, three hundred thousand there.
[03:12:50.485 --> 03:12:54.828]  With people just going Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, Old, Young, Gay, Straight, Chang.
[03:12:54.929 --> 03:12:55.989]  I don't want forced masks.
[03:12:56.109 --> 03:12:57.250]  I don't want forced injections.
[03:12:57.370 --> 03:12:58.191]  I don't want open borders.
[03:12:58.511 --> 03:12:59.552]  I don't want devalued dollars.
[03:12:59.712 --> 03:13:00.533]  I don't want fentanyl.
[03:13:00.813 --> 03:13:01.874]  I don't want the New World Order.
[03:13:01.994 --> 03:13:03.035]  I don't want Klaus Schwab.
[03:13:03.315 --> 03:13:04.356]  I don't want election fraud.
[03:13:06.636 --> 03:13:10.520]  When you simply do that, everybody else already feels like you.
[03:13:10.880 --> 03:13:13.042]  They get mobilized, they get inspired.
[03:13:13.382 --> 03:13:25.133]  And the weakest link in the New World Order's defense, the missing patch of scales on Smog's belly, where we can get the truth, the sword into his heart, is local governments.
[03:13:25.153 --> 03:13:28.856]  What the globalists teach their people, think global, act local.
[03:13:28.876 --> 03:13:36.126]   Well, we should think local, think individual, And think humanity and we should take over the local now.
[03:13:36.606 --> 03:13:38.627]  That's their cheek in the armor.
[03:13:39.668 --> 03:13:42.509]  And so we've got some of the greatest hits of Matt Baker coming up.
[03:13:43.089 --> 03:13:49.931]  But as we go to break, I want to go ahead and play a clip of him in front of the Maricopa board.
[03:13:50.031 --> 03:13:51.152]  They're talking about election fraud.
[03:13:51.172 --> 03:13:51.492]  Here it is.
[03:13:53.697 --> 03:13:54.137]  Good morning.
[03:13:55.038 --> 03:14:03.223]  Once again, the eyes of the world are upon Maricopa County for another botched election.
[03:14:04.243 --> 03:14:07.665]  Am I here to accuse you of stealing the vote?
[03:14:08.826 --> 03:14:11.628]  Heavens no, for that would make me a terrorist, wouldn't it?
[03:14:13.206 --> 03:14:39.407]  Let me ask you, if you took your life savings to a bank, and the teller put them in a machine, and the machine kicked out one out of four of your bills, and the teller said, don't worry, we'll put them in box three over here, and we'll let you know how many were in there later, we'll send them off to a separate location, and someone will be sure to get back to you and tell you how much money you have, would you be okay with that?
[03:14:40.865 --> 03:14:43.687]  No, you would not be okay with that.
[03:14:44.228 --> 03:14:45.949]  Now ask yourself the question.
[03:14:46.409 --> 03:14:48.030]  Which is more valuable?
[03:14:48.651 --> 03:14:50.692]  Your vote or your money?
[03:14:51.513 --> 03:14:54.655]  Now ask a lobbyist that same question.
[03:14:54.976 --> 03:14:57.678]  Now ask a campaign manager that question.
[03:14:57.998 --> 03:15:01.701]  Now ask Mark Zuckerberg that question.
[03:15:01.981 --> 03:15:03.402]  Which is more valuable?
[03:15:03.782 --> 03:15:05.824]  Your money or your vote?
[03:15:06.304 --> 03:15:07.405]  Or your country?
[03:15:07.745 --> 03:15:08.726]  Or this world?
[03:15:08.987 --> 03:15:14.792]  Or the corruption that is taking over every single county in this nation?
[03:15:16.013 --> 03:15:27.743]  And then you look into your own soul and you look back at yourself in the mirror and realize that you are the cancer that is tearing this nation apart!
[03:15:28.717 --> 03:15:29.718]  Good day!
[03:15:30.758 --> 03:15:31.259]  Thank you.
[03:15:31.779 --> 03:15:35.762]  Our next speaker... And that is the truth, and that is the spirit of liberty.
[03:15:36.042 --> 03:15:41.586]  Matt Baker, underscored, unhinged on Instagram, at band.video, slave to liberty.
[03:15:42.066 --> 03:15:45.908]  Matt Baker and some of his greatest hits, when we come back on the other side.
[03:15:46.129 --> 03:15:47.530]  Again, Matt Baker's our guest.
[03:15:47.830 --> 03:15:48.710]  We should all be.
[03:15:49.191 --> 03:15:49.771]  Matt Baker.
[03:15:49.811 --> 03:15:51.512]  They call him the Alex Jones of dreadlocks.
[03:15:51.912 --> 03:15:53.474]  He does look like my brother or something.
[03:15:53.494 --> 03:15:55.915]  If I grew dreadlocks out, if I could, I'd look like Matt Baker.
[03:15:56.275 --> 03:15:56.956]  We'll be right back.
[03:16:00.703 --> 03:16:10.369]  Communication, and again, the communication, the ability to communicate, but the ability to get you the latest information on what just happened.
[03:16:10.629 --> 03:16:14.572]  Let's say a nuke, when it goes off, goes off there, we'll know it.
[03:16:14.791 --> 03:16:20.191]   those of us who are able to communicate, but in essence, you're watching the destruction
[03:16:20.191 --> 03:16:27.511]   and the desire to have total control over all information, total information, awareness, and total information control.
[03:16:27.511 --> 03:16:35.711]   The satellite phone and the bivy stick are the only way that you can stay certain of being able to access
[03:16:35.711 --> 03:16:38.951]  different communication people that will have these.
[03:16:38.955 --> 03:16:41.316]  A lot of hams are getting the bivy stick.
[03:16:41.356 --> 03:16:43.018]  A lot of hams are getting satellite phones.
[03:16:43.358 --> 03:16:59.390]  So, and it's always important for people to understand, once you begin to lose it up here, and you start to worry and fret, and it's the mindset of knowing what's going on takes away from the uncertainty that initiates panic.
[03:16:59.950 --> 03:17:01.252]  That's a powerful statement.
[03:17:01.332 --> 03:17:01.732]  Absolutely.
[03:17:01.752 --> 03:17:03.153]  People should go to InfoWarsPhone.com.
[03:17:03.173 --> 03:17:07.918]  That takes you to the big satellite store, and we get the sponsorship and the credit, so it's a win-win for all of us.
[03:17:08.418 --> 03:17:09.700]  Stay on air, plus you get ready.
[03:17:09.840 --> 03:17:15.040]   InfoWarsPhone.com and you get the free satellite phone, the free bivy stick, whatever you choose,
[03:17:15.040 --> 03:17:17.920]  but you simply pay for the monthly subscription.
[03:17:17.920 --> 03:17:20.159]  And again, calls to your sat phone are free.
[03:17:20.159 --> 03:17:22.319]  It's the calls you use that you get the monthly deal on.
[03:17:22.319 --> 03:17:30.000]  You can also call 941-955-1020, 941-955-1020, 941-955-1020.
[03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:31.000]  Also talk to the great operators.
[03:17:31.000 --> 03:17:34.639]  They can answer all your questions, 941-955-1020.
[03:17:34.639 --> 03:17:36.159]  This is one of the no-brainers.
[03:17:36.192 --> 03:17:36.792]  You need a gun.
[03:17:36.852 --> 03:17:37.612]  You need storable food.
[03:17:37.632 --> 03:17:38.613]  You need a relationship with God.
[03:17:38.633 --> 03:17:39.673]  You need water filtration.
[03:17:39.693 --> 03:17:40.533]  You need friends and family.
[03:17:40.553 --> 03:17:41.454]  That's all the best things.
[03:17:41.594 --> 03:17:44.315]  And you need a baby stick or a satellite phone right now.
[03:17:44.335 --> 03:17:45.595]  Infowarsphone.com.
[03:17:45.636 --> 03:17:47.856]  I mean, this is insurance everybody needs to have right now.
[03:17:47.876 --> 03:17:48.697]  People need to get it.
[03:17:48.717 --> 03:17:49.737]  They need to learn how to use it.
[03:17:49.757 --> 03:17:50.438]  It's very easy.
[03:17:50.838 --> 03:17:51.258]  I use it.
[03:17:51.278 --> 03:17:52.098]  I've got them at my house.
[03:17:52.118 --> 03:17:52.839]  I've got them at the office.
[03:17:52.898 --> 03:17:53.898]  This is critical.
[03:17:53.898 --> 03:17:58.898]  [Music]
[03:17:58.898 --> 03:18:07.608]   Until about 150 years ago, cultures all over the world believed that people got sick and died in many cases in the
[03:18:07.608 --> 03:18:10.898]  winter because of something called vapors.
[03:18:11.187 --> 03:18:15.149]  They associated these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[03:18:15.649 --> 03:18:19.611]  Of course, it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people.
[03:18:19.991 --> 03:18:22.633]  What was killing people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[03:18:22.793 --> 03:18:29.973]   You see, the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3.
[03:18:29.973 --> 03:18:33.852]   But if you're not getting enough sun, you will not produce vitamin D3.
[03:18:33.852 --> 03:18:38.533]   And then it's very easy for viruses and other things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[03:18:38.533 --> 03:18:43.332]   So now it's more important than ever, because the winner's here, to take high quality vitamin D3.
[03:18:43.332 --> 03:18:48.172]   And we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload into your body

[03:20:11.751 --> 03:20:26.821]  So here's Matt Baker.
[03:20:28.297 --> 03:20:32.142]  Well over a year and a half ago, confronting the vaccine tyrants.
[03:20:32.923 --> 03:20:35.787]  Remember back then it seemed like the lockdown would never end and they were invincible.
[03:20:35.807 --> 03:20:37.029]  Now they're asking for amnesty.
[03:20:37.309 --> 03:20:40.353]  We're not giving them amnesty until they all face Nuremberg Trial 2.0.
[03:20:41.274 --> 03:20:41.635]  Here it is.
[03:20:41.474 --> 03:20:49.554]  is we'll go to Matt himself.
[03:20:50.126 --> 03:20:51.348]  That's the wind of time.
[03:20:51.368 --> 03:20:53.690]  That's the wind of history.
[03:20:53.710 --> 03:21:00.819]  That's the wind blowing through your ancestors' bones, begging you to do the right thing.
[03:21:00.839 --> 03:21:02.942]  Sir, can you please state your name for the audio record?
[03:21:02.761 --> 03:21:07.761]  that Matt Baker is calling upon from Ocean Beach.
[03:21:07.761 --> 03:21:10.520]  [crowd cheering]
[03:21:10.520 --> 03:21:19.640]   The wind that is blowing through the black people, through the white people, through the Chinese people,
[03:21:19.640 --> 03:21:23.280]   through the Mexican-Americans, to the people that built this building
[03:21:23.280 --> 03:21:26.761]  with their bare hands to raise up this nation.
[03:21:26.810 --> 03:21:35.337]  They are begging you and they are blowing through your veins and they should be putting a tangle up the spine of your back.
[03:21:35.777 --> 03:21:38.199]  And they should be begging you to do the right thing!
[03:21:38.219 --> 03:21:40.781]  You're about to open a pit of hell!
[03:21:41.141 --> 03:21:44.924]  You do not get a vaccine passport put on us!
[03:21:45.364 --> 03:21:55.252]  You know, as the population who's in control, you know that the people or the politicians, once you get a power, you will never relinquish it!
[03:21:55.732 --> 03:22:08.442]  Do you think that the four feet of marble that holds you above, high in this chamber, will help you from the fate of humanity which you are unleashing?
[03:22:09.543 --> 03:22:10.544]  No!
[03:22:11.004 --> 03:22:11.745]  It won't!
[03:22:12.485 --> 03:22:17.427]  Your children and your children's children will be subjugated!
[03:22:17.967 --> 03:22:21.208]  They will be asked, how many vaccines have you had?
[03:22:21.649 --> 03:22:23.869]  Have you been a good little Nazi?
[03:22:24.270 --> 03:22:24.850]  Heil Fauci!
[03:22:24.870 --> 03:22:25.630]  Heil Fauci!
[03:22:28.331 --> 03:22:29.592]  Hail Fauci!
[03:22:30.152 --> 03:22:31.453]  Hail Fauci!
[03:22:32.053 --> 03:22:37.235]  There's been a lot of talk about the Nuremberg Code.
[03:22:37.315 --> 03:22:40.057]  Well, I brought you a copy.
[03:22:40.097 --> 03:22:42.978]  You are all in violation of Section 1.
[03:22:43.038 --> 03:22:44.959]  Yes, you, Dr. Wilton.
[03:22:45.599 --> 03:22:56.382]  You are in violation of the Nuremberg Code, which is international law, and the definition is... Thank you, sir.
[03:22:56.402 --> 03:22:57.442]  Your time has expired.
[03:22:57.482 --> 03:23:01.583]  The definition is, we shall not be coerced.
[03:23:02.184 --> 03:23:03.544]  All of this is coercion.
[03:23:03.744 --> 03:23:09.166]  The vaccine passport is coercion, and the penalty for violating the Nuremberg Code is death.
[03:23:09.206 --> 03:23:10.006]  Please take a seat.
[03:23:14.746 --> 03:23:16.746]  Please take a seat.
[03:23:16.746 --> 03:23:18.746]  [applause]
[03:23:18.746 --> 03:23:20.746]  [music]
[03:23:20.746 --> 03:23:22.746]  Matt Baker joins us for the rest of the hour.
[03:23:22.746 --> 03:23:23.746]  hour.
[03:23:24.092 --> 03:23:25.913]  Matt, I tell you, what a time to be alive.
[03:23:26.073 --> 03:23:27.554]  Absolute Nuremberg violation.
[03:23:28.355 --> 03:23:32.457]  The ADL is giving an award to Pfizer for their Joseph Mingala activity.
[03:23:32.477 --> 03:23:36.099]  They should create the official Joseph Mingala Appreciation Award.
[03:23:36.119 --> 03:23:37.179]  I mean, it's not even a joke.
[03:23:37.219 --> 03:23:38.140]  These people are sick.
[03:23:38.600 --> 03:23:42.122]  Matt Baker, your view on the stone election, the whole world, with us for the rest of the hour.
[03:23:42.142 --> 03:23:42.762]  God bless you, brother.
[03:23:42.581 --> 03:23:45.581]  brother you're a real inspiration.
[03:23:45.581 --> 03:23:50.940]  Are we up?
[03:23:49.267 --> 03:23:50.008]  Yes, sir, you're up.
[03:23:50.028 --> 03:23:52.209]  So just what do you want to tackle first?
[03:23:52.509 --> 03:23:54.711]  I felt like I was going out to a break there.
[03:23:54.931 --> 03:23:56.412]  No, no, I'm bad about that.
[03:23:56.492 --> 03:23:57.532]  I'm bad about that.
[03:23:57.572 --> 03:23:59.914]  But how about the winds of change are with us, brother.
[03:24:01.375 --> 03:24:02.255]  Well, they are.
[03:24:02.415 --> 03:24:09.519]  You know, I went to this other school board, no, city council meeting, that is, the board of supervisors, that is.
[03:24:09.740 --> 03:24:14.863]  I want to know who is it that creates the talking points for the board of supervisors?
[03:24:16.323 --> 03:24:24.389]  The Board of Supervisors out here in Arizona is almost an exact clone replica of the Board of Supervisors that is in San Diego.
[03:24:24.449 --> 03:24:26.531]  They have the same exact talking points.
[03:24:26.611 --> 03:24:28.572]  They have the same exact agendas.
[03:24:28.673 --> 03:24:30.234]  They're all New World Order agendas.
[03:24:30.394 --> 03:24:32.035]  Oh, it's all Agenda 23 and Agenda 21.
[03:24:32.175 --> 03:24:33.496]  It's all implemented by Davos.
[03:24:35.771 --> 03:24:39.234]  Yeah, I want to know who it is that's giving these guys their talking points.
[03:24:39.315 --> 03:24:44.940]  You need to go to your local board of supervisors and find out what they're up to.
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:47.242]  Because I can guarantee you, it's not good.
[03:24:47.683 --> 03:24:51.186]  These people pass every single thing that's on their agenda.
[03:24:51.226 --> 03:24:56.111]  They'll have a supposedly right-leaning person and a supposedly left-leaning person.
[03:24:56.591 --> 03:25:04.357]  And they'll put things on the agenda and literally every single thing they put on the agenda, they go, okay, anybody against?
[03:25:04.457 --> 03:25:04.718]  No?
[03:25:04.918 --> 03:25:05.218]  Okay.
[03:25:05.358 --> 03:25:09.502]  And the agenda passes literally to a T every single time.
[03:25:09.522 --> 03:25:14.065]  It just goes, it's just a train of tyranny that just rolls right through all of our towns.
[03:25:14.365 --> 03:25:17.328]  And we don't even know, we don't even realize what's going on with it.
[03:25:17.828 --> 03:25:25.494]  You know, I think we should get some biodegradable bullets, you know, because that would be really helpful in this situation.
[03:25:25.514 --> 03:25:26.395]  You know, I'm just kidding.
[03:25:27.716 --> 03:25:30.679]  Well, expanding on that, what you get is a central issue.
[03:25:31.079 --> 03:25:33.621]  Whether we're in Australia or the U.S.
[03:25:33.681 --> 03:25:35.743]  or Canada or Europe, it doesn't matter.
[03:25:35.803 --> 03:25:39.546]  It's the same New World Order agenda, the same talking points, the same program.
[03:25:41.181 --> 03:25:41.782]  It is, man.
[03:25:41.862 --> 03:25:42.842]  And you gotta get out there.
[03:25:42.862 --> 03:25:43.783]  You gotta be part of it.
[03:25:43.843 --> 03:25:46.545]  You can't listen to people who say, there's nothing we can do.
[03:25:46.866 --> 03:25:51.309]  You know, look at the ripple effect that just a person like I cause.
[03:25:51.530 --> 03:25:52.931]  Or Alex Stein.
[03:25:53.091 --> 03:25:54.592]  You know, I gotta give props to Alex Stein.
[03:25:55.092 --> 03:25:56.153]  He's so hardworking.
[03:25:56.193 --> 03:26:07.862]   He kind of inspired me to continue on and to find Be like a lightning rod for the things that are happening and changing.
[03:26:08.042 --> 03:26:14.226]  So you become the path of least resistance and you raise your hand up and lightning strikes you.
[03:26:14.346 --> 03:26:17.808]  God moves through you because you're the path of least resistance.
[03:26:18.170 --> 03:26:20.270]  And that's what needs to happen.
[03:26:20.270 --> 03:26:25.910]   And while we are channeling that energy, and while we are becoming the path of least resistance,
[03:26:25.910 --> 03:26:30.589]  we need to use that energy to resist the New World Order.
[03:26:30.589 --> 03:26:34.270]  We have to put friction on what they're doing.
[03:26:34.270 --> 03:26:40.869]   I was joking with Owen the other day that it's like Klaus Schwab is penetrating your cabinet,
[03:26:40.869 --> 03:26:47.750]   and what you need to do is put a little friction and don't lubricate it for good old Klaus Schwab
[03:26:47.750 --> 03:26:49.029]  the new world order.
[03:26:48.930 --> 03:26:55.018]  We need to stop these people at every point, at every place, everywhere, every time.
[03:26:55.698 --> 03:26:56.639]  And all the time.
[03:26:56.979 --> 03:26:58.220]  And that's what we have to do.
[03:26:58.540 --> 03:27:04.765]  And if I and Alex Stein can make these giant ripples, just imagine if there were thousands of us, or millions of us.
[03:27:05.165 --> 03:27:13.591]  If every single person on planet Earth would just simply gain that warrior spirit, and just everyone just said, nope, we're not doing that.
[03:27:13.811 --> 03:27:15.673]  All in unison, all at the same time.
[03:27:16.073 --> 03:27:18.075]  We wouldn't even be having this conversation.
[03:27:18.355 --> 03:27:22.758]  We'd be down at the river, having a beer, and looking at the fish jump.
[03:27:23.178 --> 03:27:31.706]  But no, we're not, because everybody wants to be a slave, and they want to give in, and they want to relax, and they want to say, there's nothing we can do, trust the plan.
[03:27:31.786 --> 03:27:33.007]  Well, don't trust the plan.
[03:27:33.087 --> 03:27:34.028]  You are the plan.
[03:27:34.428 --> 03:27:35.289]  You are the plan.
[03:27:35.630 --> 03:27:36.570]  You are the motion.
[03:27:36.931 --> 03:27:43.637]  You need to move, get off your ass, go out there, and engage the system.
[03:27:45.342 --> 03:27:49.728]  Everything they do is about getting the individual to not engage, to believe your back is broken.
[03:27:50.069 --> 03:27:52.492]  We've gotten Pentagon documents that's hijacked by the globalists.
[03:27:52.512 --> 03:27:56.217]  It's all about breaking the individual's will and making you think you don't have power.
[03:27:56.878 --> 03:27:57.940]  Because we do have the power.
[03:27:59.511 --> 03:28:00.452]  We absolutely do.
[03:28:00.772 --> 03:28:01.613]  We have the power.
[03:28:01.833 --> 03:28:03.054]  Humanity has the power.
[03:28:03.294 --> 03:28:07.238]  And if anyone has put that out there, it is you, the great Alex Jones.
[03:28:07.338 --> 03:28:08.039]  I love you, man.
[03:28:09.340 --> 03:28:11.662]  When I saw you in studio, I gave you that big hug.
[03:28:11.862 --> 03:28:15.625]  And afterwards, I was like, man, I should have shook his hand because he's a Texan.
[03:28:15.645 --> 03:28:16.386]  But you know what?
[03:28:16.566 --> 03:28:17.267]  I just love you so much.
[03:28:17.287 --> 03:28:18.228]  Hey, I was happy to get my hug.
[03:28:18.248 --> 03:28:19.389]  I was running from meeting to meeting.
[03:28:19.409 --> 03:28:20.670]  Wish we could have gone and hung out, man.
[03:28:21.275 --> 03:28:26.576]  I just work like... You know, everyone's like, man, he's just under the gun.
[03:28:26.616 --> 03:28:30.457]  People don't realize, I mean, Alex is really in it to win it.
[03:28:30.637 --> 03:28:32.817]  He is on the ship.
[03:28:33.298 --> 03:28:34.698]  He is that Moby Dick.
[03:28:34.818 --> 03:28:37.098]  He is the Jonah going out for that whale.
[03:28:37.558 --> 03:28:39.899]  He is not going down without a fight.
[03:28:40.039 --> 03:28:44.920]  He's going to stay on board and man this ship, hopefully to a brighter horizon.
[03:28:45.100 --> 03:28:45.500]  Absolutely.
[03:28:45.540 --> 03:28:46.041]  Stay right there.
[03:28:46.081 --> 03:28:51.984]  Let's talk about the election fraud, Ukraine, the war, the world government, all of it with Matt Baker, Trade Head.
[03:28:52.024 --> 03:28:54.386]  Listen, I don't worry about me because I know we're all under attack.
[03:28:54.486 --> 03:28:56.247]  I mean, we're all in deep trouble.
[03:29:00.413 --> 03:29:14.005]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been studying the globalists for more than 30 years, and I have tracked the fact they're obsessed with keeping the general population of the planet, particularly America, from producing our own free market solutions and ideas.
[03:29:14.405 --> 03:29:16.687]  They want monopolies over the economy.
[03:29:17.148 --> 03:29:25.895]  And we saw that in the last three years, blocking therapeutics, blocking scientists and researchers that expose the truth about COVID and its origins or its treatment.
[03:29:26.636 --> 03:29:36.742]  And there have been so many great telephonic sites and organizations and groups that popped up with the therapeutics that saved potentially millions of lives, bare minimum hundreds of thousands.
[03:29:37.082 --> 03:29:52.369]   But now, the platinum standard of medical doctor researcher, Dr. Peter McCullough, working with other top doctors From around, not just the U.S., but Canada and around the world, have come up with OnlineHealthNow.com, the wellness company.
[03:29:52.749 --> 03:29:54.109]  So it's a one-stop shop.
[03:29:54.629 --> 03:30:05.673]  So when they take over Big Pharma, when Big Pharma takes over local medicine, the answer is going to doctors, going to organizations and groups that actually care about you and aren't working with the power structure.
[03:30:06.053 --> 03:30:07.254]  That's how free market works.
[03:30:07.854 --> 03:30:19.218]  And it's so important, believe me, my own life, my family's life, that I had patriot doctors and telephonic medicine during the heat of the pandemic that saved members of my family's life.
[03:30:19.738 --> 03:30:21.219]  And I felt like I was dying.
[03:30:21.539 --> 03:30:22.439]  I think it saved my life.
[03:30:22.839 --> 03:30:31.100]   But now, the platinum standard of this, Dr. Peter McCullough, is heading up a major organization to bring this revolution to the general public.
[03:30:31.100 --> 03:30:33.359]  This is a revolutionary act, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:30:33.359 --> 03:30:39.119]   Take control of your health freedom today at onlinehealthnow.com with The Wellness Company.
[03:30:39.119 --> 03:30:42.480]   Dr. Peter McCullough, spend a few minutes telling us about this revolutionary action.
[03:30:42.480 --> 03:30:45.740]   Alex, thanks for introducing the most positive development
[03:30:45.740 --> 03:30:47.959]  we've seen now in decades.
[03:30:48.203 --> 03:30:55.870]  For the last three years, we've had continuance of fear and dark news day by day by day.
[03:30:55.890 --> 03:30:59.314]  It's so wonderful to bring you a positive solution.
[03:30:59.354 --> 03:31:12.642]   The Wellness Company, we have tremendous physician leadership, wonderful e-commerce support staff, I have a website that is second to none, a cell phone app, and it's up and running.
[03:31:12.982 --> 03:31:47.878]   This alternative health care system has uncensored content, virtual appointments with doctors, other health care providers, and integrates with community pharmacies, your local laboratory and in vitro diagnostics, imaging companies, treatment packages, real expertise in acute and post-COVID syndrome, vaccine injury syndromes, all your usual Primary care needs, certainly handling prescription needs on demand, and then has holistic products in an online store, including nutraceuticals and supplements, all in one package.
[03:31:48.398 --> 03:31:51.481]  The Wellness Company for a low monthly price.
[03:31:52.182 --> 03:31:58.486]  Each and every one of you are invited to join this nationwide platform and get assistance when you really need it.
[03:31:58.546 --> 03:32:05.331]  Let's never have a situation with COVID-19 like we had where people could not get access to care.
[03:32:05.731 --> 03:32:07.652]  I'm so proud to be a part of this new venture.
[03:32:08.093 --> 03:32:14.817]  This is exactly what we need so we're not sucker punched when they try the next viral release at one of their labs.
[03:32:14.756 --> 03:32:19.236]  Onlinehealthnow.com, onlinehealthnow.com.
[03:32:19.236 --> 03:32:23.957]   I had dozens of other great telephonic groups and organizations on that did a great job
[03:32:23.957 --> 03:32:25.076]  in the last three years.
[03:32:25.076 --> 03:32:29.836]   But now you guys are creating an umbrella group, bringing everybody together and taking it to the next level.
[03:32:29.836 --> 03:32:31.356]  Everybody should bookmark it.
[03:32:31.375 --> 03:32:31.855]  You should call.
[03:32:31.875 --> 03:32:32.716]  You should sign up today.
[03:32:32.736 --> 03:32:44.903]  Because not just the prescriptions, not just the meetings, not just the diagnostics, not just meeting with the doctors and others, but the amount of free information and the studies and the reports and the facts and the information is a brain trust.
[03:32:45.283 --> 03:32:49.325]  Now more important than ever with all the big tech censorship we're seeing over our health.
[03:32:49.706 --> 03:32:51.086]  Onlinehealthnow.com.
[03:32:51.347 --> 03:32:52.567]  Thank you so much, Dr. Peter McCullough.
[03:32:52.766 --> 03:33:06.365]  Thank you.
[03:33:06.152 --> 03:33:07.831]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:33:07.831 --> 03:33:33.592]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:33:35.919 --> 03:33:39.842]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:43.805 --> 03:33:47.848]  So I'm about to tie in a Ponzi scheme bigger than Bernie Madoff's.
[03:33:49.109 --> 03:33:53.452]  Not as big as Bloomberg's Ponzi schemes or the Federal Reserve's, but big.
[03:33:54.693 --> 03:33:56.514]  An FTX to the COVID response.
[03:33:57.577 --> 03:34:09.953]  Now, FTX was only set up three and a half years ago by a consortium of federal regulators and then a bunch of their children in the Harvard globalist mafia that runs so much of this new world order.
[03:34:11.457 --> 03:34:31.741]  And one of the many things they did was not just ship millions over to Ukraine on record, but was also to put in massive amounts of money into controlling the COVID response and going out and financing studies to say vitamin D isn't good for you, hydroxychloroquine isn't good, all these other great things are worthless.
[03:34:32.741 --> 03:34:42.045]   So here it is, Together COVID-19, TogetherTrial.com, wholly financed subsidiary, Of FTX.
[03:34:42.966 --> 03:34:54.636]  And they go into working with the United Nations and Big Pharma, to be a quote, independent third party, which they're not, to tell you that all of these therapeutics are worthless.
[03:34:56.197 --> 03:34:57.999]  Absolutely worthless.
[03:34:58.019 --> 03:35:00.821]  Even though all the other studies show the opposite.
[03:35:01.842 --> 03:35:05.785]  Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, the list goes on and on.
[03:35:06.446 --> 03:35:08.468]  Says absolutely failed, worthless.
[03:35:09.631 --> 03:35:18.779]  So, making sure people didn't get therapeutics, making sure they got things like Randesivir that didn't help you and killed a third of the people they were given.
[03:35:19.079 --> 03:35:21.541]  So this guy just didn't steal billions of dollars.
[03:35:22.102 --> 03:35:23.083]  At its peak, $100 billion.
[03:35:23.743 --> 03:35:24.944]  He was worth, quote, $16 billion.
[03:35:26.340 --> 03:35:28.282]  Sam Bankman fried.
[03:35:29.303 --> 03:35:31.144]  No, ladies and gentlemen, he is fried now.
[03:35:31.705 --> 03:35:35.528]  This guy was a front man for the whole deep state agenda.
[03:35:35.768 --> 03:35:37.129]  It's all tied to the CIA.
[03:35:37.469 --> 03:35:37.870]  You name it.
[03:35:37.890 --> 03:35:40.932]  We're gonna be getting more into that coming up in the next hour.
[03:35:41.052 --> 03:35:53.303]  But that's the COVID tie-in of what these monsters, these killers, these hitmen of civilization and our men, women, and children and our old people are up to.
[03:35:54.681 --> 03:35:57.709]  Absolutely disgusting demons.
[03:35:59.413 --> 03:36:00.817]  They can't help it, it's what they do.
[03:36:02.429 --> 03:36:04.310]  Here we go again, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:36:04.350 --> 03:36:08.111]  Democrats review push to enforce COVID masks wearing as winter nears.
[03:36:08.131 --> 03:36:09.412]  We'll get more of that next hour.
[03:36:09.832 --> 03:36:11.073]  All the different newscasts pushing it.
[03:36:11.093 --> 03:36:12.033]  But this is the big news.
[03:36:12.593 --> 03:36:17.275]  NBC News admits anti-vaxxers were right about COVID shots causing myocarditis.
[03:36:17.295 --> 03:36:22.497]  They don't deny that it does cause massive increase of myocarditis, heart attacks, and death.
[03:36:22.537 --> 03:36:27.379]  Big report by Jamie White with all the studies and documents and their admissions on InfoWars.com.
[03:36:27.419 --> 03:36:28.400]  I suggest you share it.
[03:36:29.594 --> 03:36:31.455]  Coming up next hour, the Tucker Carlson Report.
[03:36:31.596 --> 03:36:37.360]  mRNA injections destroy your natural immunity, causing all sorts of diseases along with heart problems and blood clots.
[03:36:37.760 --> 03:36:41.523]  Lancet's study and other studies prove mRNA injections are dangerous and deadly.
[03:36:42.323 --> 03:36:46.486]  Which we told you before they even rolled the shots out in the middle of 2020.
[03:36:46.546 --> 03:36:48.448]  That's why we're demonized.
[03:36:48.488 --> 03:36:49.168]  We do our research.
[03:36:50.329 --> 03:36:51.170]  Here's some of the other articles.
[03:36:51.510 --> 03:36:56.634]  Poster boy for vaccine campaign dies suddenly at just four years old.
[03:36:57.725 --> 03:37:00.767]  He's the national poster boy, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:37:01.908 --> 03:37:02.949]  A tragic event.
[03:37:04.350 --> 03:37:11.135]  Santino Badoy Blanco, just four years old, has passed away from pneumonia, November 3rd.
[03:37:11.896 --> 03:37:15.038]  Respiratory problems associated with his heart, according to multiple sources.
[03:37:16.159 --> 03:37:23.385]  And it just goes on how he was the national poster boy in Argentina for those injections.
[03:37:24.298 --> 03:37:25.479]  Here is another one.
[03:37:25.959 --> 03:37:28.681]  Olympic swimmer, 24, injured by Pfizer-Covid jab.
[03:37:28.741 --> 03:37:29.521]  I couldn't function.
[03:37:29.921 --> 03:37:31.482]  I wanted to end my life.
[03:37:33.404 --> 03:37:42.409]  Genevieve Florence details how British healthcare system refused to acknowledge vaccine blame, but now they admit it was the vaccine.
[03:37:42.449 --> 03:37:44.030]  She was paralyzed by it.
[03:37:44.790 --> 03:37:47.212]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[03:37:47.512 --> 03:37:49.193]  Here's another one.
[03:37:49.213 --> 03:37:51.154]  28-year-old Australian football player.
[03:37:51.174 --> 03:37:51.795]  This is just today.
[03:37:52.830 --> 03:37:54.832]  Heather Anderson has died unexpectedly.
[03:37:57.314 --> 03:37:58.555]  Here's an interesting meme from Twitter.
[03:37:58.915 --> 03:38:03.640]  Stop saying you did your research before you got the injection.
[03:38:04.100 --> 03:38:06.182]  You are the research.
[03:38:07.283 --> 03:38:10.065]  And that is absolutely true.
[03:38:10.486 --> 03:38:12.167]  Then we've got all these stacks I mentioned.
[03:38:12.587 --> 03:38:13.829]  Mass could return as L.A.
[03:38:13.869 --> 03:38:16.831]  County sees worrying uptick in COVID and RSV infections.
[03:38:17.051 --> 03:38:19.474]  When you die of the shot now, they call it an RSV infection.
[03:38:20.535 --> 03:38:20.935]  Update!
[03:38:21.516 --> 03:38:29.121]  Toxic vaccine ingredient SM-102 has connection to Epstein Genome Project and his secret genetic editing projects.
[03:38:31.383 --> 03:38:34.185]  And it goes on and on and on from there.
[03:38:34.865 --> 03:38:38.068]  I've got some nightmare footage I'm going to get to out of China.
[03:38:39.348 --> 03:38:41.310]  That is all coming up.
[03:38:43.397 --> 03:38:44.838]  In the next hour.
[03:38:45.478 --> 03:38:47.439]  Footage they do not want you to see.
[03:38:48.099 --> 03:38:50.501]  That is coming up next hour.
[03:38:51.461 --> 03:39:29.703]   But I wanted to get to Together, trial.com, Together, COVID-19, this consortium group, 22 research sites, 8,000 patients enrolled, and the studies funded by FTX, fraudulent Company, fraudulent PCR test, fraudulent studies, fraudulent everything to come out and tell you that all of these so-called treatments and therapeutics are worthless.
[03:39:32.970 --> 03:39:35.992]  Only Remdesivir is good for you because it didn't work.
[03:39:36.453 --> 03:39:37.474]  And it was recommended by Fauci.
[03:39:37.494 --> 03:39:38.735]  So they're giving their marching orders.
[03:39:39.215 --> 03:39:40.356]  They go out, they do their studies.
[03:39:40.776 --> 03:39:41.997]  So that's what FTX is doing.
[03:39:42.017 --> 03:39:43.498]  They're not just stealing money from you.
[03:39:44.079 --> 03:39:45.820]  They are killing you.
[03:39:47.121 --> 03:39:51.865]  So that's all coming up after MGG, who joins this next segment, leaves us.
[03:39:51.905 --> 03:39:54.767]  We'll be looking at the election and mail-in ballots, not a stop.
[03:39:55.928 --> 03:39:58.290]  This ongoing massive fraud.
[03:40:00.351 --> 03:40:07.578]   With her, Coming up, then I'm going to get into this situation.
[03:40:08.079 --> 03:40:10.701]  In fact, I see that we have MTG right now.
[03:40:12.043 --> 03:40:12.723]  He's ready to go.
[03:40:12.823 --> 03:40:14.145]  So we've got her to the end of the hour.
[03:40:14.265 --> 03:40:17.028]  Let's do a few minutes right now and come back to her in the next segment.
[03:40:17.048 --> 03:40:18.009]  We'll have her to the end of the hour.
[03:40:18.409 --> 03:40:25.596]   Marjorie Taylor Greene had such a giant Tsunami, they couldn't steal it from her, but wow, they certainly are doing it all over the place.
[03:40:25.636 --> 03:40:26.957]  Carrie Lake's calling fraud.
[03:40:27.598 --> 03:40:29.459]  We have the cameras going out at key areas.
[03:40:29.779 --> 03:40:31.341]  It's all in the key battleground areas.
[03:40:31.861 --> 03:40:33.343]  MTG, great to have you with us.
[03:40:33.363 --> 03:40:37.526]  Thank you so much, Alex, and I'm happy to be on with you today.
[03:40:38.107 --> 03:40:39.728]  We've got about two and a half minutes to break.
[03:40:39.968 --> 03:40:43.932]  We'll get into the meat and potatoes next segment, but your first response to what we're witnessing.
[03:40:45.874 --> 03:40:53.738]  In Arizona, I think we watched the election be stolen, slowly stolen, day by day, counting these mail-in ballots.
[03:40:54.418 --> 03:41:03.563]  And it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take our election seriously when we, we just, it's election month, Alex, it's not election day.
[03:41:04.043 --> 03:41:05.144]  And that's the problem.
[03:41:05.724 --> 03:41:08.365]  And everything changed after COVID-19.
[03:41:08.465 --> 03:41:11.247]  They illegally changed state elections.
[03:41:12.147 --> 03:41:17.311]  Mailing ballots to anyone and everyone, and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people.
[03:41:17.671 --> 03:41:19.653]  Well, this isn't any way to run an election.
[03:41:19.713 --> 03:41:23.395]  We are in a serious country when we have elections that can be stolen like this.
[03:41:23.955 --> 03:41:41.629]   And I believe that, just like I believe the election was stolen in 2020, and I have no problem saying that, and it is so absurd for the media and the Democrats to attack us that question our election integrity and question the fact that elections Um, shouldn't be run the way they are.
[03:41:41.929 --> 03:41:51.001]  We're not election deniers, we're election realists and we want to see elections that are done in such a way where no one can question them, Democrats or Republicans.
[03:41:51.381 --> 03:41:54.665]  Many Democrats have questioned elections over the years.
[03:41:54.966 --> 03:41:58.270]  Hillary Clinton, Stacey Abrams, I mean we can go down the list.
[03:41:58.690 --> 03:42:03.552]  Even the press secretary questioned 2018 Stacey Abrams election in Georgia.
[03:42:03.892 --> 03:42:08.213]  Carrie Lake is right to be calling it exactly what it is, election fraud.
[03:42:08.814 --> 03:42:11.174]  And you know, the people of Arizona deserve better.
[03:42:11.254 --> 03:42:13.915]  The people of the United States deserve better in our elections.
[03:42:14.355 --> 03:42:24.719]  And so until everyone is willing to get on the same page and really work hard to protect our elections, then the same thing will continue to keep happening.
[03:42:24.739 --> 03:42:26.420]  So it makes me question about 2024 now.
[03:42:28.274 --> 03:42:28.594]  I agree.
[03:42:28.614 --> 03:42:30.276]  Let's cover the waterfront when we come back.
[03:42:30.816 --> 03:42:32.098]  But what you say is so central.
[03:42:32.118 --> 03:42:37.022]  I saw a compilation video this weekend of dozens of newscasts saying the exact same thing.
[03:42:37.322 --> 03:42:37.943]  It's normal.
[03:42:38.003 --> 03:42:39.184]  We've always waited weeks.
[03:42:39.644 --> 03:42:40.985]  This is the new normal.
[03:42:41.065 --> 03:42:44.228]  It's not the new normal, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:42:44.248 --> 03:42:46.130]  Marjorie Taylor Greene is our guest.
[03:42:46.150 --> 03:42:48.672]  We're going to look at what's currently happening.
[03:42:48.992 --> 03:42:48.672]  2024.
[03:42:49.413 --> 03:42:50.334]  Trump to Sanish.
[03:42:51.094 --> 03:42:51.995]  January 6th.
[03:42:52.095 --> 03:42:53.076]  Jam-packed segment.
[03:42:53.116 --> 03:42:53.857]  Mail-in ballots.
[03:42:54.197 --> 03:42:54.697]  Straight ahead.
[03:42:54.536 --> 03:43:10.076]  Stay with us.
[03:43:10.051 --> 03:43:17.978]  Elon Musk has hinted at this himself, but when he spoke out against returning Alex Jones to the platform, there were obvious concerns.
[03:43:18.438 --> 03:43:28.927]  Now, what I think might be going on, Elon Musk is making a business decision knowing that if Alex Jones is allowed back on the platform, Twitter might get removed from the App Store.
[03:43:29.147 --> 03:43:30.989]  Oh, you can't have it on your iPhone.
[03:43:31.149 --> 03:43:33.190]  Oh, you can't have it on your Android anymore.
[03:43:33.571 --> 03:43:43.779]  And now that one of the head tech executives and app manufacturers at Apple has removed his account could be a sign of things to come.
[03:43:43.839 --> 03:43:50.165]  Now others think it might be a personal choice that Elon Musk made to not let Alex Jones back on the platform.
[03:43:50.545 --> 03:43:55.850]  Now here was Alex Jones response to the news of Elon Musk not reinstating his account.
[03:43:56.050 --> 03:44:25.574]   The ADL And the Southern Primary Law Center, the Democratic Party, the European Union and the Justice Department and CIA moles that Congress had hearings on last week are inside of his company right now and are literally trying to sabotage it, not just externally with threats of lawsuits and censorship and criminal charges from the EU, but they're also threatening to sabotage the company and the actual systems that make it operate.
[03:44:26.856 --> 03:44:28.000]  He hit the panic button.
[03:44:28.903 --> 03:44:33.024]  And basically came out and attacked me so that he can get the left off of his back.
[03:44:33.705 --> 03:44:51.111]  And, you know, it's fine to me that he did that, except he went too far and compared himself to Jesus and the whole, bring the children to me, suffer the children to me, and if you offend one of these, if you're mean to one of these kids, it's better for you to kill yourself by tying a big bowl to your neck and throwing it in the ocean.
[03:44:51.671 --> 03:44:52.611]  That's just outrageous.
[03:44:52.651 --> 03:44:57.093]  That's absolutely outrageous that I'm supposedly the worst guy in the world because of media hype.
[03:44:57.793 --> 03:44:58.854]  But that story will carry itself out.
[03:44:58.873 --> 03:45:01.313]  has misrepresented what I really said about Sandy Hook.
[03:45:01.313 --> 03:45:05.792]   If Elon loves to quote Christ so much in between dressing up like Satan,
[03:45:05.792 --> 03:45:11.472]   he should quote Christ's most famous quote, "Let he without sin cast the first stone."
[03:45:11.472 --> 03:45:14.472]  But that story will carry itself out.
[03:45:14.472 --> 03:45:22.833]   What we are appreciative of is you supporting us at Infowarsstore.com so that we can still speak

[03:46:45.012 --> 03:46:48.252]  to you when you shop at Infowarsstore.com.

[03:46:52.791 --> 03:47:01.971]  here on air every day just like we have for decades.
[03:47:01.971 --> 03:47:06.291]  a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:06.118 --> 03:47:07.818]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:47:07.818 --> 03:47:34.618]  MTG has them really scared.
[03:47:34.586 --> 03:47:36.228]  That's why they demonize her and lie about her.
[03:47:36.528 --> 03:47:40.754]  Despite all their fraud in Georgia, and we know it went on, the evidence is coming out, she won by 66%, 33%.
[03:47:44.714 --> 03:47:45.135]  Extra.
[03:47:45.775 --> 03:47:47.577]  They are so scared of her.
[03:47:47.737 --> 03:47:52.401]  Only massive tsunamis, only red waves can stop the fraud.
[03:47:52.481 --> 03:47:54.903]  She overwhelmed the algorithms.
[03:47:54.963 --> 03:48:01.609]  And remember, Mark Elias, Hillary Clinton's lawyer, ran around the country, but mainly targeted her to try to stop her from being able to run.
[03:48:01.629 --> 03:48:07.695]  So if you want to know if they'll steal elections, they try to stop our most popular candidates from running or running for re-election.
[03:48:08.155 --> 03:48:10.954]   These people, in my view, Our criminals.
[03:48:11.334 --> 03:48:18.524]  We were talking during the break, you were making points before we went to break, about the mail-in ballots, about what we just witnessed and what Americans have to do.
[03:48:18.945 --> 03:48:20.067]  MTG, lay it on us.
[03:48:21.752 --> 03:48:29.735]  Well, what we're seeing right now is unbelievable, and I can't imagine that people sit on the sidelines and just allow this to continue.
[03:48:30.215 --> 03:48:38.198]  Here's the problem, Alex, is we have to look not only at this election, we have to look at 2020's election, and we have to think forward to 2024.
[03:48:38.718 --> 03:48:44.160]  And in order to win elections, our elections have to be secure, and voters have to be confident in the process.
[03:48:44.540 --> 03:48:55.087]   But voters are not confident in the process when ballots just get continued to be counted Slowly, every single day, and then you watch a strong Republican candidate like Carrie Lake.
[03:48:56.129 --> 03:49:02.654]  Lose, day after day, and lose, and then to the point where the media finally calls it for the Democrat candidate.
[03:49:02.694 --> 03:49:07.578]  And here in California, we're watching elections be slowly counted and slowly counted.
[03:49:08.419 --> 03:49:10.520]  This is worse than a third world country.
[03:49:10.780 --> 03:49:13.262]  We're the laughing stock of the world.
[03:49:13.322 --> 03:49:14.623]  That's what our elections are.
[03:49:14.943 --> 03:49:16.345]  And our enemies know it.
[03:49:16.485 --> 03:49:17.445]  And we're being played.
[03:49:17.545 --> 03:49:19.127]  And the American people deserve better.
[03:49:19.387 --> 03:49:20.107]  Here's why, Alex.
[03:49:20.147 --> 03:49:22.109]  The taxpayers pay for the elections.
[03:49:22.529 --> 03:49:23.730]  They pay for the ballots.
[03:49:23.790 --> 03:49:25.612]  They pay for the people that work the elections.
[03:49:26.032 --> 03:49:27.413]  They pay for the machines.
[03:49:27.814 --> 03:49:29.215]  They pay for all of it.
[03:49:29.255 --> 03:49:30.496]  And so they're the customer.
[03:49:30.856 --> 03:49:34.540]  So the taxpayers and the voters, they deserve better.
[03:49:34.640 --> 03:49:36.001]  They deserve voter ID.
[03:49:36.101 --> 03:49:40.525]  We should have same-day, one-day elections, not election months.
[03:49:41.053 --> 03:49:43.395]  Not where it drags out over and over and over.
[03:49:43.935 --> 03:49:50.159]  Mail-in ballots should be reduced drastically only to certain emergency scenarios.
[03:49:50.519 --> 03:49:52.421]  And we should have voter ID.
[03:49:52.501 --> 03:49:53.261]  Voter ID.
[03:49:53.361 --> 03:49:54.762]  Only citizens can vote.
[03:49:55.142 --> 03:50:00.346]  These are easy fixes that would make elections secure and give voters confidence.
[03:50:00.806 --> 03:50:03.168]  That's what we should care about, is voter confidence.
[03:50:03.668 --> 03:50:10.313]  And until that happens, we're going to continue to have real problems, and we've been warned about it over and over.
[03:50:10.433 --> 03:50:16.118]  President Trump has talked about it non-stop for nearly two years now, and he's right to do so.
[03:50:16.158 --> 03:50:16.718]  But guess what?
[03:50:16.738 --> 03:50:17.559]  So have the Democrats.
[03:50:18.019 --> 03:50:19.701]  They have talked about election fraud.
[03:50:19.781 --> 03:50:21.542]  They have talked about stolen elections.
[03:50:22.503 --> 03:50:24.004]  And Democrats will do anything.
[03:50:24.405 --> 03:50:30.270]  They'll try to take people like me off the ballot through lawsuits, and that's what you were talking about just a moment ago.
[03:50:30.670 --> 03:50:37.136]  But it is a very real issue, and it's something that I'm concerned about, and I will continue to fight for it.
[03:50:37.916 --> 03:50:40.459]  We're fighting up here in Washington, D.C.
[03:50:40.819 --> 03:50:45.383]  Let me tell you something that is very possible, and I'm very concerned about it.
[03:50:45.939 --> 03:50:50.881]  We don't even know how many seats we are going to hopefully win the majority with.
[03:50:50.962 --> 03:50:51.782]  We may have 219 seats.
[03:50:51.601 --> 03:51:01.200]   219 seats. You see, we need 218 to be the majority. But if we have such a razor-thin
[03:51:01.200 --> 03:51:08.561]   majority like that, the Democrats can possibly choose a speaker by pulling away a few Republicans
[03:51:08.561 --> 03:51:13.521]   to vote with them for one speaker that they can all tolerate and get along with.
[03:51:13.845 --> 03:51:15.206]  Well, let me tell you something, Alex.
[03:51:15.246 --> 03:51:20.871]  The most important thing that Republicans need, we need the gavel and we need subpoena power.
[03:51:21.051 --> 03:51:22.272]  We need subpoena power.
[03:51:22.632 --> 03:51:32.296]  Because without subpoena power, we cannot hold these traitors accountable for all of the corruption that they have been doing to the American people for the past two years.
[03:51:32.316 --> 03:51:54.587]   Subpoena power can only come if Republicans choose the Speaker, and I'll tell you right now, there's talks going on With the very moderate Republicans in our conference of speaking with the Democrats, there was one particular congressman, Don Bacon, that actually told a reporter last night that he would consider working with the Democrats to choose a speaker.
[03:51:54.908 --> 03:51:57.829]  And that's something that should terrify every single American.
[03:51:58.269 --> 03:52:01.471]  You know, the next two years, we don't have the White House.
[03:52:01.871 --> 03:52:04.413]  The next two years, we do not control the Senate.
[03:52:04.913 --> 03:52:10.558]  The next two years, we're going to have a razor-thin, razor-thin majority of Republican-controlled House.
[03:52:10.958 --> 03:52:17.203]  And that's why we have to be unified behind a speaker, just our speaker, so we have subpoena power.
[03:52:17.624 --> 03:52:21.387]  And that's what this is all about, subpoena power, and we've got to control the purse strings.
[03:52:21.627 --> 03:52:23.149]  Absolutely, and we need the House.
[03:52:23.789 --> 03:52:34.400]  We need the House to be able to start the indictment process for impeachment of Biden, who certainly deserves it for open borders, for Ukraine, for Hunter Biden, all the things they're doing.
[03:52:35.261 --> 03:52:40.446]  What do you make separately of the attempt to drive a wedge by corporate media between Trump and DeSantis?
[03:52:40.466 --> 03:52:43.770]  What do you make of that whole attempt at civil war they're trying to kick off?
[03:52:45.199 --> 03:52:46.640]  Well, I have to give you props.
[03:52:46.941 --> 03:52:48.722]  Alex, you were right all along.
[03:52:48.802 --> 03:52:50.844]  This is a war of information.
[03:52:50.924 --> 03:52:52.105]  It's the information war.
[03:52:52.686 --> 03:52:54.988]  And I love to say it, Alex Jones is right.
[03:52:55.108 --> 03:52:56.449]  And you have been right on that.
[03:52:56.549 --> 03:52:59.752]  And Republicans, we are constantly losing this war.
[03:53:00.092 --> 03:53:01.714]  You know, there's so many donors.
[03:53:02.054 --> 03:53:07.998]  Republican donors donate hundreds of millions of dollars that go to organizations and PACs and places all over the country.
[03:53:08.318 --> 03:53:10.640]  But they never fight the war of information.
[03:53:10.680 --> 03:53:11.981]  They never fight the left.
[03:53:12.021 --> 03:53:13.462]  The left controls the media.
[03:53:13.802 --> 03:53:16.404]  And when the left controls the media, they control the narrative.
[03:53:16.724 --> 03:53:22.928]  And you can see that their media is very powerful and they beat up Republican candidates every single election cycle.
[03:53:23.268 --> 03:53:26.190]  I get smeared and lied about every single day in the news.
[03:53:26.530 --> 03:53:29.152]  I get vilified every single day in the news.
[03:53:29.912 --> 03:53:37.997]  If they actually talked to me and knew what I'm about and who I am as a person, they could never say those things about me, but they control the media.
[03:53:38.398 --> 03:53:41.680]  What we have to do is we have to fight smarter, Alex.
[03:53:42.100 --> 03:53:45.702]  We need to declare war on the media that's controlled by the Democrats.
[03:53:45.722 --> 03:53:46.463]  I totally agree.
[03:53:46.523 --> 03:53:50.185]  You've got to go early because your vote just got called, but the minute and a half we have left.
[03:53:50.365 --> 03:53:59.491]  This FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, all this stuff, we now know was a Democrat money laundering slush fund funding their operations, siphoning money off.
[03:54:00.212 --> 03:54:12.960]  If the Republicans take the House, are you going to call for committee hearings and investigation into them and their money laundering slush fund of FTX to Ukraine and the $50 million they gave the Democrats in this election cycle?
[03:54:14.497 --> 03:54:24.702]  Absolutely, Alex, and that's why I am going to vote for Kevin McCarthy for Speaker, because we need the gavel to have subpoena power in order to do just that.
[03:54:24.822 --> 03:54:26.203]  Those things are outrageous.
[03:54:26.263 --> 03:54:38.196]   That is American taxpayer dollars that was supposed to be aid to Ukraine that clearly went into this cyber investment program and went into this You know, it's outrageous.
[03:54:38.296 --> 03:54:40.656]  We have got to hold those people accountable.
[03:54:40.996 --> 03:54:44.197]  I want an audit of every single penny that has gone to Ukraine.
[03:54:44.477 --> 03:54:48.899]  But in order to do that, we have to have the gavel and we have to have subpoena power.
[03:54:48.939 --> 03:54:52.079]  That's the most important thing that I can express to people.
[03:54:52.419 --> 03:55:00.862]   We could choose any speaker we want and we could fight for these conservative Outlines and policies that I absolutely adore.
[03:55:01.163 --> 03:55:04.064]  But we can't get anything done over the next two years.
[03:55:04.384 --> 03:55:05.685]  We've got to have the gavel.
[03:55:05.725 --> 03:55:07.466]  We've got to have the power.
[03:55:07.566 --> 03:55:13.569]  And that's why Tucker said on the eve of the election, they've got to steal it because they're cornered rats.
[03:55:13.609 --> 03:55:15.710]  The good news is humanity is waking up.
[03:55:15.750 --> 03:55:16.751]  Populism is exploding.
[03:55:17.171 --> 03:55:19.232]  MTG, thank you so much for joining us.
[03:55:19.572 --> 03:55:20.413]  Go get that vote done.
[03:55:21.533 --> 03:55:22.334]  Okay, thank you.
[03:55:23.612 --> 03:55:25.073]  All right, there she goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:55:25.233 --> 03:55:25.513]  Wow.
[03:55:25.633 --> 03:55:28.194]  And she'll be in studio with us hopefully very, very soon.
[03:55:28.214 --> 03:55:29.334]  What a great lady.
[03:55:30.555 --> 03:55:30.795]  All right.
[03:55:30.815 --> 03:55:40.618]  We're going to start the next hour and I'm going to then take my time getting into the model of the new COVID rollout, the new lockdowns Biden's planning.
[03:55:40.718 --> 03:55:41.498]  It's admitted now.
[03:55:42.639 --> 03:55:44.159]  It's about to go down.
[03:55:44.680 --> 03:55:45.980]  But we have the public waking up.
[03:55:46.020 --> 03:55:46.720]  We can stop it.
[03:55:46.760 --> 03:55:47.641]  We can do it together.
[03:55:48.201 --> 03:56:05.806]   Now, With the globalists planning to do new COVID lockdowns and new COVID hysteria and new fear, it is so important, God knows what they're going to release or what they're going to pull, to be as healthy as you can, to get sleep, to drink a lot of water, to eat a lot of great vegetables, and to take a lot of great supplements.
[03:56:06.206 --> 03:56:10.330]  And we have the best supplements out there to boost your immune system and your overall health.

[03:57:33.142 --> 03:57:34.463]  The enemy's fighting to shut us down.
[03:57:34.623 --> 03:57:36.625]  Only you can keep us on air.
[03:57:36.725 --> 03:57:38.226]  Only you can make that decision.
[03:57:38.606 --> 03:57:41.168]  So I'm firing the bat signal again and asking you to not wait.

[03:57:47.413 --> 03:57:48.254]  Massively discounted.
[03:57:48.274 --> 03:57:48.954]  Biggest sell of the year.
[03:57:48.994 --> 03:57:49.575]  They're selling out.
[03:57:50.427 --> 03:57:53.489]  The modern world where they convince a woman to get a job, the man to get a job.
[03:57:53.569 --> 03:57:56.911]  They inflate the currency so nobody can exist any other way because it's too expensive.
[03:57:57.212 --> 03:57:58.612]  The parents are out working all day.
[03:57:58.773 --> 03:58:01.514]  The school and the internet and the matrix raise your children.
[03:58:01.534 --> 03:58:04.857]  Your children go to school all day and be told things that you may not want them to learn.
[03:58:04.997 --> 03:58:08.359]  Then they sit on the internet and read things and watch things you may not want them to watch.
[03:58:08.379 --> 03:58:10.861]  You talk to them for 10 minutes at the end of the day, they go to bed.
[03:58:10.901 --> 03:58:17.925]  You're fighting with your 10 minutes against endless hours of the most entertaining programming or the most forceful programming.
[03:58:17.945 --> 03:58:18.906]  In school, it's forceful.
[03:58:19.166 --> 03:58:20.167]  On the internet, it's entertaining.
[03:58:20.447 --> 03:58:22.988]  Convincing them of ideas that you perhaps don't agree with.
[03:58:23.289 --> 03:58:24.449]  I've seen it myself on YouTube.
[03:58:24.489 --> 03:58:28.952]  I've seen a guy in America driving his car and his kids were in the back seat and he was arguing with them about an issue.
[03:58:29.472 --> 03:58:30.693]  And he was like, where did you hear that?
[03:58:30.933 --> 03:58:31.233]  School?
[03:58:31.413 --> 03:58:32.914]  He's like, why did the school tell you that?
[03:58:32.934 --> 03:58:33.414]  That's not true.
[03:58:33.454 --> 03:58:36.476]  And his own children are arguing with him because they learned it in school.
[03:58:36.596 --> 03:58:37.998]  Have you ever tried to take your children out of school?
[03:58:38.018 --> 03:58:38.718]  You'll get fined.
[03:58:38.738 --> 03:58:39.379]  You'll get in trouble.
[03:58:39.419 --> 03:58:40.580]  No, your kids have to go to school.
[03:58:40.801 --> 03:58:42.382]  You have to give your kids away to the school.
[03:58:42.643 --> 03:58:45.646]  If you don't give your kids away to the brainwashing, you'll get in trouble.
[03:58:46.006 --> 03:58:57.659]  As an all-star fighter, businessman, motivational speaker, and philanthropist, Andrew Tate has truly earned the title of Top G. But there's another title Andrew Tate holds that has enraged the globalists.
[03:58:58.059 --> 03:58:59.721]  He is consecutively the most
