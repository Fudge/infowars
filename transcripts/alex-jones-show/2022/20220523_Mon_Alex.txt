[00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:08.109]  Through a lot of pain and suffering, food scarcity, fuel scarcity, we're going to lose a couple of billion people probably on this planet over the next few years.
[00:00:08.169 --> 00:00:11.292]  But in that process, humanity will awaken like never before.
[00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:18.698]  We will dismantle the system of globalist control, the global fascists, the global Nazis, if you will, that are trying to destroy humanity.
[00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:31.589]   And humanity will prevail, and we will live in an era, a golden age of abundance and ingenuity, and unleash the science, the real science, the potential, the free energy, the healing, all of it, We will live in that golden era.
[00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:32.109]  It's coming.
[00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.311]  I totally agree with you.
[00:00:34.371 --> 00:00:35.672]  This is our greatest moment.
[00:00:36.132 --> 00:00:41.097]  Evil learned how to create a system of cloaking itself, but now it's being uncloaked.
[00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:41.857]  It's incredible.
[00:00:42.198 --> 00:00:43.499]  Stay with us more straight ahead.
[00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.324]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:00:49.204 --> 00:00:56.204]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:56.204 --> 00:01:14.204]  [Music]
[00:01:14.204 --> 00:01:15.204]  InfoWars.
[00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:16.391]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:20.471]   today I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the
[00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:20.471]  world.
[00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:22.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:24.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:26.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:28.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:30.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:30.471 --> 00:01:32.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:34.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:36.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:40.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:40.471 --> 00:01:42.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:42.471 --> 00:01:44.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:46.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:46.471 --> 00:01:48.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:50.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:52.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:54.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:56.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:58.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:00.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:02:00.471 --> 00:02:02.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:04.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:06.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:08.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:02:08.471 --> 00:02:10.471]   I'm going to show you the most beautiful sunset in the world.
[00:02:11.328 --> 00:02:29.818]  The military, more than 5,000 are there in Geneva, Switzerland, as the World Economic Forum publicly takes full command of the United Nations and world government and declares war on the nation-state, on populace, on the family, and on all of our medical freedom.
[00:02:30.518 --> 00:02:36.430]   We have lived to see it, the public rise of a tyrannical Let's also be clear.
[00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.271]  The future is not just happening.
[00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:40.453]  The future is built by us.
[00:02:40.393 --> 00:02:46.072]   is their spokesman of the Bilderberg Group at the helm of the World Economic Forum, now
[00:02:46.072 --> 00:02:50.033]  in full command of world government.
[00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:58.393]   Let's also be clear. The future is not just happening. The future is built by us, by a
[00:02:58.393 --> 00:03:06.793]   powerful community as you here in this room. We have the means to improve the state of
[00:03:06.793 --> 00:03:07.312]  the world.
[00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:17.312]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:03:08.566 --> 00:03:11.008]  But two conditions are necessary.
[00:03:11.948 --> 00:03:20.254]  The first one is that we act all as stakeholders of larger communities.
[00:03:21.254 --> 00:03:26.177]  That we serve not only our self-interests, but we serve the community.
[00:03:27.118 --> 00:03:30.040]  That's what we call stakeholder responsibility.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.002]  And second, that we collaborate.
[00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:52.522]  This is the reason why you find many opportunities here during the meeting to engage into very action and impact-oriented initiatives to make progress related to specific issues on the global agenda.
[00:03:54.083 --> 00:04:04.285]   Two weeks ago, The UN Secretary General signed a treaty with the World Economic Forum, putting them in command of the United Nations.
[00:04:04.385 --> 00:04:06.627]  We are living to see world government.
[00:04:07.007 --> 00:04:15.208]   Here's an image and video from Twitter of Literally, when they pan through the footage, hundreds of giant private jets lined up landing.
[00:04:15.828 --> 00:04:26.536]  These very people are all over the news telling you that you can't have a car or air conditioning and you can't have children because they need all of your resources.
[00:04:26.736 --> 00:04:30.139]  Now, my friends, we are living in just an incredibly epic time.
[00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:31.620]  They've declared war on humanity.
[00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:44.212]   Here is the president of Latvia openly saying that the main enemy Is the populace, the people that live in the countries that want to run their own lives.
[00:04:44.252 --> 00:04:47.075]  We'll play this clip, go to break, and go through all of this.
[00:04:47.135 --> 00:04:54.480]  But we have lived through the secret world government, now the open launch of the world government using the fear of pandemics to execute the operation.
[00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:56.222]  Here's the clip and we'll be right back.
[00:04:57.461 --> 00:05:03.545]  I think there are three main failures of the liberal democracy in the last 10-15 years.
[00:05:04.906 --> 00:05:10.610]  There are ignorance of the social problems caused by globalization.
[00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:27.001]  There was also ignorance or misperception or mismanagement of the crisis of migration and of the crisis of cultural diversity.
[00:05:27.781 --> 00:05:32.706]  And there also is a third very important reason.
[00:05:33.948 --> 00:05:41.075]  We have now, since the new social networks, a new kind of formation of public opinion.
[00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:42.997]  This is not more the classical one.
[00:05:44.057 --> 00:05:51.057]   democracy is based as a classical race, how the public opinion is formed.
[00:05:52.057 --> 00:05:59.057]  [Music]
[00:05:59.057 --> 00:06:07.057]   A powerful combine of mega banks, international corporations with unlimited fraudulent financing
[00:06:07.057 --> 00:06:13.057]   are meeting in Geneva, Switzerland with the World Economic Forum, the public arm of the Bilderberg Group,
[00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:21.747]   with full public command under treaty, a corporate treaty to rule the earth and to shut off carbon and cause mass
[00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:23.057]  death and war.
[00:06:23.057 --> 00:06:26.057]  [Music]
[00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:30.837]   These people are Ten times more dangerous than Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin or Mao Zedong.
[00:06:32.678 --> 00:06:43.164]  They have been hidden in the shadows for the last 60 years, 70 years after the end of World War II and now they are emerging and they are making their move against humanity.
[00:06:43.284 --> 00:06:45.025]  It is beyond epic.
[00:06:45.966 --> 00:06:57.548]   It is our duty and our destiny that we are here together on air, the undisputed Tip of the spear against the world government.
[00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:01.572]  We are ragtag, but we have God on our side and we have the truth on our side.
[00:07:02.032 --> 00:07:05.375]  And what the globalists are pushing is absolute death and destruction.
[00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:31.366]   So we should be able to defeat them easily if the public understands that a world government treaty to put the UN in control of national, nation-state responses to new emerging viruses and other pandemics Is nothing but a biomedical corporate takeover for a world government ID to buy and sell, to control and track and trace every facet of your life.
[00:07:31.866 --> 00:07:33.708]  These are the people shutting off the food supply.
[00:07:33.768 --> 00:07:35.209]  These are the people collapsing the borders.
[00:07:35.569 --> 00:07:40.233]  These are the people narcotics trafficking and child and sex slave trafficking.
[00:07:40.273 --> 00:07:46.499]  These are the people openly pushing Disney to target three-year-olds to teach them to be LGBTQ.
[00:07:48.291 --> 00:07:50.333]  These are the transhumanist devils.
[00:07:51.234 --> 00:07:53.075]  These are your mortal enemies.
[00:07:54.016 --> 00:07:56.138]  And yes, I've taken them on at point-blank range.
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:11.893]  There was a major project that ended, except in very rare cases, the Clintons violate this rule and so does George Soros, that you basically stop assassinating most of your political opponents and just politically destroy them and debank them.
[00:08:13.075 --> 00:08:18.988]  One of the most common questions I get on the street and also from guests that come here to visit us is, why are you still alive?
[00:08:19.368 --> 00:08:20.551]  All the stuff you said came true.
[00:08:20.571 --> 00:08:21.092]  How did you know?
[00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:30.884]  Well from study and research and having family that had had glimpses into the dark side and what was going on that told me as a child what was really happening.
[00:08:31.264 --> 00:08:36.147]  And so I grew up and those seeds were planted and I saw the tyranny growing right in front of me as they said it would.
[00:08:36.187 --> 00:08:40.510]  And I took up the resistance against this because I believe in humanity.
[00:08:40.811 --> 00:08:41.451]  I believe in you.
[00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:42.212]  I believe in myself.
[00:08:42.232 --> 00:08:44.193]  And more importantly, I believe in God.
[00:08:45.234 --> 00:08:46.635]  And so there's been a project they've had.
[00:08:47.734 --> 00:08:49.815]  Because they get blackmailed when they kill people.
[00:08:50.215 --> 00:08:51.815]  Their own operatives go sideways.
[00:08:52.595 --> 00:08:57.497]  It's very clean for them to do it bureaucratically and assassinate people's character and their name.
[00:08:57.957 --> 00:08:59.937]  And you've seen that project against George Truly.
[00:09:00.417 --> 00:09:02.298]  You've seen it against Trump, though he's not perfect.
[00:09:03.018 --> 00:09:08.060]  You've certainly seen it against Bolsonaro and Viktor Orban and so many others.
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:14.681]  And I am extremely honored and blessed to be amongst the top four or five people demonized on the planet.
[00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:22.182]   And I don't say that To kind of be like John Hancock who signed his name big and bold at the bottom of the Declaration of Independence.
[00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:23.904]  I know why he did it.
[00:09:24.044 --> 00:09:24.765]  I admire him.
[00:09:24.845 --> 00:09:26.186]  He's got more courage than I had.
[00:09:26.686 --> 00:09:35.274]  I don't sign my name big and bold just so it's known that I got the biggest spiritual lavos on the block.
[00:09:36.195 --> 00:09:37.236]  And I don't think he did that either.
[00:09:37.256 --> 00:09:38.157]  He did it to show courage.
[00:09:38.497 --> 00:09:40.559]  A lot of folks were being very timid, signing very small.
[00:09:42.273 --> 00:09:46.674]  Messing their signatures up a little bit because they understood they were signing their death warrant if they lost.
[00:09:46.714 --> 00:09:50.935]  Many of them lost their lives, lost their families, lost everything that they gave us this great nation.
[00:09:52.495 --> 00:10:03.638]  I am seen as the biggest signature on the new Declaration of Independence against tyrants because I've done incredible study of the enemy and we've been able to mobilize more people worldwide than any other organization.
[00:10:03.738 --> 00:10:07.319]  And that credit, my friend, goes to all of you.
[00:10:09.172 --> 00:10:19.457]  But I want to just before we cover all this massive news, as our enemies publicly meet and declare war on the family, on medical freedom, on the nation state, on populism, I've got all the clips right here.
[00:10:21.458 --> 00:10:22.439]  This is just day one.
[00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:24.560]  It just started eight hours ago.
[00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.802]  They're about eight hours ahead of us right now in Central Time, seven hours, New York time.
[00:10:32.444 --> 00:10:39.564]   And It's just an amazing moment to see it all emerge and everything.
[00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:42.613]  That both my grandfathers told me about.
[00:10:42.633 --> 00:10:50.855]  It wasn't just my mother's father that was a real expert, because whatever he was involved in, I don't know, a lot of it was secret.
[00:10:51.535 --> 00:10:56.456]  He knew basically everything I know today, and he knew this back in the 70s and 80s and 90s.
[00:10:57.257 --> 00:10:58.177]  He died at 80 years old.
[00:10:58.217 --> 00:10:59.017]  Wish he was still here today.
[00:10:59.057 --> 00:10:59.897]  What an amazing man.
[00:11:00.357 --> 00:11:01.157]  Man before his time.
[00:11:01.517 --> 00:11:13.849]   But my other grandfather, Jerry Jones, not the Dallas Cowboys owner, he knew what was going on as well and was resisting it as well
[00:11:13.849 --> 00:11:19.250]   in his own ways in local government some of the posts he had in his county in east Texas and
[00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:26.519]   then with his son, my father. And I've been very, very blessed to come from a family like that.
[00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:32.140]   And I just feel really sorry for people that are growing up in the modern age who have parents that have
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.850]  no idea of what is even going on.
[00:11:34.014 --> 00:11:40.658]  But I think it's important to recognize that there were the Barry Goldwaters and yes, the Ronald Reagans in the 70s and 60s.
[00:11:41.319 --> 00:11:47.343]  If you listen to Barry Goldwater or Ronald Reagan in speeches in the 60s and 70s, it sounded like Alex Jones.
[00:11:47.723 --> 00:11:51.385]  Because it's not Alex Jones that knows all this magically.
[00:11:51.406 --> 00:11:54.768]  It's not Alex Jones that knows how to predict stuff exactly as it happens.
[00:11:55.328 --> 00:12:16.855]  Many years before, it's the enemy has been public in the books they write, and the meetings that have been leaked, and their white papers, and now they're on the world stage saying they're in charge of you, and saying there's too many of us, and saying they want to get rid of us out of one side of their mouth, and out of the other side of their mouth.
[00:12:18.255 --> 00:12:23.197]  They are telling us they want us to take shots because they love us.
[00:12:24.704 --> 00:12:27.829]  And they want to take good care of us.
[00:12:30.193 --> 00:12:31.676]  So, that's where we are.
[00:12:32.858 --> 00:12:36.223]  Forty years ago, almost everything was not signals intelligence.
[00:12:38.246 --> 00:12:39.206]  Maybe 10% was.
[00:12:39.226 --> 00:12:41.327]  90% was human intelligence on the ground.
[00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:44.567]  Armies of Russian assassins.
[00:12:44.787 --> 00:12:45.647]  Armies of U.S.
[00:12:45.687 --> 00:12:46.227]  assassins.
[00:12:47.028 --> 00:12:48.568]  Fighting all over the world.
[00:12:48.708 --> 00:12:49.448]  Killing each other.
[00:12:50.288 --> 00:12:53.769]  Numbers of dead much larger per decade than died in the Vietnam War.
[00:12:54.229 --> 00:12:55.329]  Never to be reported on.
[00:12:56.489 --> 00:13:04.571]  But now they kill us with 5G and poison shots and abortion in the womb and now babies after they're born.
[00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:09.197]   Many states have Pass laws to legalize that.
[00:13:09.237 --> 00:13:13.400]  This is hell on earth being released.
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:36.266]   But because of all the General Benton K. Partins, and the Ted Gundersons, and the Anthony Hilders, and the Anthony Suttons, and the Congressman Hansons, and just unbelievable men and women, the Phyllis Schlaflys, and the Countless resistors of this.
[00:13:36.947 --> 00:13:48.515]  We have a very good chance, because of people like our ancestors, to defeat this.
[00:13:50.897 --> 00:13:52.198]  I was thinking of Charlotte Isserby.
[00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:56.181]  She's the one that leaked all the Skull & Bones data to Anthony Sutton in Congress.
[00:13:57.082 --> 00:13:58.103]  The Congressional Archivist.
[00:13:59.764 --> 00:14:01.305]  And so, she just died a few weeks ago.
[00:14:01.325 --> 00:14:03.787]  Because her dad was Skull & Bones.
[00:14:05.126 --> 00:14:16.348]  Because of these people that had courage that were talking about this when all there was was three networks and a bunch of newspapers controlled by the very same organizations.
[00:14:18.229 --> 00:14:24.430]  They fought that uphill battle so that we now can defeat the New World Order together with God's help.
[00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:27.831]  And the reason I raised all this before I go to break and come back with all the news is this.
[00:14:29.645 --> 00:14:33.047]  Trending number one last night, still like number five this morning when I checked.
[00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:37.149]  Hashtag Bill Gates bioterrorist.
[00:14:40.351 --> 00:14:42.052]  Trending number one on Twitter.
[00:14:44.073 --> 00:14:45.934]  Hashtag Bill Gates bioterrorist.
[00:14:46.554 --> 00:14:54.418]  So this isn't people talking to crowds of a hundred, two hundred, a thousand, like Barry Goldwater was 50 years ago, 60 years ago.
[00:14:54.438 --> 00:15:07.861]   This is The largest group of people ever awake on the planet to these secret societies and these shadow organizations.
[00:15:07.981 --> 00:15:14.383]  And we can, and we must, and we will prevail.
[00:15:14.823 --> 00:15:16.604]  We don't have a choice.
[00:15:17.304 --> 00:15:19.985]  The stakes are just too incredibly high.
[00:15:20.005 --> 00:15:26.768]  All right, we're gonna go right to, and there's reporters on the ground, we have it on this week as well, right to the ground.
[00:15:28.431 --> 00:15:40.794]  In Geneva, Switzerland, where the corporate world government is publicly taking full command of their de-industrialization, starvation, mass war, mass bio-attack program, monkeypox, and more.
[00:15:41.374 --> 00:15:42.434]  Stay with us, we'll be back.
[00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:50.456]  The Velderberg Group, founded after World War II, what was left of the European elite and the Nazis with the British Empire and the U.S.
[00:15:52.466 --> 00:15:56.629]  In the 70s, quietly set up a public arm to recruit operatives in governments.
[00:15:57.549 --> 00:16:01.352]  And in the 90s, went completely public, the early 90s, the Dabos Group.
[00:16:02.053 --> 00:16:11.579]  Two weeks ago, the UN officially signed a treaty, merging with the WEF, saying they will take orders from them as their corporate directorate.
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:16.823]  You go back 10 years ago, Bloomberg first started admitting to Bilderberg, grew up denying it for decades.
[00:16:18.075 --> 00:16:25.622]  And said, we want corporate leaders to be in full control of governments via a technocracy, a computer AI controlled system.
[00:16:25.702 --> 00:16:26.743]  That's what this is.
[00:16:28.084 --> 00:16:31.187]  They program it to carry out the depopulation operation.
[00:16:31.927 --> 00:16:35.330]  Here's a clip that's going viral on the internet right now.
[00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:40.255]  Millions of views on Instagram, Twitter, you name it, just went viral over the weekend.
[00:16:40.915 --> 00:16:44.839]  They said, maybe he's a time traveler, is one of the commenters on Twitter.
[00:16:46.567 --> 00:16:47.708]  Said Joshua Steinman.
[00:16:48.648 --> 00:16:50.769]  And no, I'm not a time traveler.
[00:16:50.909 --> 00:16:53.891]  I was reading the Globalist documents and their plan.
[00:16:56.132 --> 00:17:01.355]  And I was able, once I got involved 28 years ago, to meet the best and brightest minds who were fighting it.
[00:17:02.155 --> 00:17:03.336]  And here we are today.
[00:17:03.516 --> 00:17:04.417]  We know how to beat it.
[00:17:04.817 --> 00:17:06.578]  And we better beat it because we know what's coming next.
[00:17:06.718 --> 00:17:08.019]  Mass collapse and death.
[00:17:08.279 --> 00:17:08.979]  And now it's here.
[00:17:09.039 --> 00:17:10.220]  You don't need me to tell you anymore.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.281]  You can tune in and watch him saying it.
[00:17:13.341 --> 00:17:14.662]  But let's go back to the year 1999.
[00:17:18.552 --> 00:17:22.675]  350 million or more people in Africa, and then 12 die of Ebola in one little town.
[00:17:22.715 --> 00:17:24.176]  They go, Oh, Ebola!
[00:17:24.236 --> 00:17:24.817]  Ebola!
[00:17:24.897 --> 00:17:25.537]  Ebola!
[00:17:25.657 --> 00:17:26.678]  Oh, Ebola!
[00:17:26.818 --> 00:17:33.742]  And they had CNN people saying, saying, diseases will be coming out of the rainforest because Mother Earth is mad!
[00:17:34.063 --> 00:17:36.544]  Literally like witch doctors going, Booga booga!
[00:17:36.564 --> 00:17:37.405]  Sun not come back!
[00:17:37.945 --> 00:17:41.067]  You know, when we have floods and rain and meteors might hit the Earth.
[00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:43.169]  What if a meteor hits the Earth tomorrow and destroys a city?
[00:17:43.209 --> 00:17:45.971]  Are they going to say this is because the people of Earth have been bad?
[00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:47.812]  That meteor just came from space.
[00:17:48.052 --> 00:17:50.113]  It's very primitive control apparatus.
[00:17:50.413 --> 00:17:56.437]  It's how chiefs and medicine doctors used to control and shaman with control of people say, oh, if you're not good, the crops won't come.
[00:17:56.737 --> 00:17:58.378]  Oh, the environment, if we're not good.
[00:17:58.398 --> 00:18:02.801]  I don't want to eat a piece of meat that's got dioxins in it from plastics production.
[00:18:03.181 --> 00:18:10.206]  I don't want them dumping nickel cadmium and heavy metal Grignard reagents in the waters.
[00:18:10.726 --> 00:18:11.866]  So my kids are deformed?
[00:18:11.966 --> 00:18:12.566]  I don't want that.
[00:18:12.586 --> 00:18:13.487]  I'm for the environment.
[00:18:13.767 --> 00:18:25.829]  But these international corrupt people financing global population control, which is just nothing more but dictators' excuses to kill men, women, and children, and girls in slave labor camps in China making Nikes, you call that good?
[00:18:26.129 --> 00:18:35.111]  And all these Hollywood people that say they love you are the ones that speak out against slave labor, are the ones you find out later, are the ones that own all the sweatshops making their clotheslines?
[00:18:35.491 --> 00:18:36.611]  They're all hypocrites!
[00:18:37.566 --> 00:18:39.949]  They're all hypocrites using you.
[00:18:40.449 --> 00:18:41.030]  So here it is.
[00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.113]  Global plan to fight infectious diseases sought.
[00:18:43.173 --> 00:18:46.757]  I haven't read this yet, but... Washington, a new plan to coordinate...
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:56.586]  International efforts to track and combat infectious diseases will be announcing by the leaders of the G7 group of industrial nations at this weekend's summit in Denver.
[00:18:56.886 --> 00:18:58.828]  White House aide said Monday!
[00:18:59.368 --> 00:19:02.810]  And the combustion engine is the greatest threat to civilization!
[00:19:03.071 --> 00:19:04.652]  Like Al Gore says in Earth and the Balance.
[00:19:05.072 --> 00:19:06.213]  No, Mr. Gore!
[00:19:06.433 --> 00:19:09.675]  The combustion engine is civilization!
[00:19:09.695 --> 00:19:12.397]  And the combustion engine's getting cleaned up!
[00:19:12.817 --> 00:19:15.899]  Because we're putting catalytic converters on the cars!
[00:19:16.199 --> 00:19:21.322]  Just like we got the horses out of the streets a hundred years ago, and we don't have a horse manure problem anymore!
[00:19:21.682 --> 00:19:23.063]  Humans move forward!
[00:19:23.363 --> 00:19:25.204]  I know the bureaucrats don't want that.
[00:19:25.444 --> 00:19:27.185]  You want us to stay down and lowly.
[00:19:27.346 --> 00:19:29.607]  You don't want us to transcend, do you?
[00:19:31.468 --> 00:19:32.969]  And I was corrected by the crew, that was in 1997.
[00:19:32.808 --> 00:19:41.808]   in 1997 so tomorrow's news today people actually see that clip they go what did
[00:19:42.537 --> 00:19:43.318]  Or is his voice fake?
[00:19:43.978 --> 00:19:55.085]  No, when you talk five, six hours a day, and you have a big chest, that's why old men sound like this, because their voices are worn out from screaming on bullhorns.
[00:19:55.666 --> 00:19:58.888]  It's called lacerations that grow polyps on your larynx.
[00:20:00.689 --> 00:20:01.769]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:03.550]  So, you know, there you've got that.
[00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.492]  And of course, it's all now what has happened.
[00:20:06.803 --> 00:20:10.684]  But let's now go to Geneva, Switzerland just eight hours ago.
[00:20:11.444 --> 00:20:27.207]  First day event has kicked off today and Savannah Hernandez and others are going to be popping in while they're there to give us reports on what they're seeing throughout the week as they try to secretly ratify this world government takeover of the medical system treaty.
[00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:38.732]   And you know, some lawyers who are smart but are not going past the surface say, well, It won't be ratified by Congress.
[00:20:39.313 --> 00:20:39.594]  Really?
[00:20:39.754 --> 00:20:40.715]  Biden's signing on to it.
[00:20:41.016 --> 00:20:41.737]  They don't care.
[00:20:42.037 --> 00:20:43.559]  The bureaucrats that run the U.S.
[00:20:44.601 --> 00:20:45.542]  created the U.N.
[00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:52.032]  And when they titularly sign on to these treaties, they follow them.
[00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:58.232]  Just like Congress didn't pass Gen 21 in 1992 in Rio de Janeiro under George H.R.
[00:20:58.252 --> 00:21:00.013]  Bush, but we're under it.
[00:21:00.093 --> 00:21:05.576]  And if you look at the plans of that, everything they called for in 1992 and signed on to was complete by the year 2020.
[00:21:05.696 --> 00:21:08.397]  And then now they want to complete the next phase by 2030.
[00:21:08.737 --> 00:21:13.939]  And boy, do you want to learn about a Gen 23 because it's the future for you and your family.
[00:21:13.999 --> 00:21:16.280]  They have charted and they have planned.
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:26.103]   But I'm really glad that folks out there on the Internet, Mike Hanson and others, I've been able to find archives of shows I did 25 years ago, like the one you just saw.
[00:21:27.104 --> 00:21:28.164]  That's 25 years ago.
[00:21:29.945 --> 00:21:31.845]  And things I'd totally forgotten about are now here.
[00:21:31.885 --> 00:21:35.887]  And it's just devastating how incredibly accurate we were.
[00:21:35.947 --> 00:21:37.487]  But we weren't accurate.
[00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:42.249]  The enemy battle plan was in our hands.
[00:21:43.509 --> 00:21:56.255]   So here's Klaus Schwab announcing that the Davos Group, our collaborators, yeah, with To take over and run the world and bragging about their power.
[00:21:56.315 --> 00:21:56.876]  Here it is.
[00:21:58.377 --> 00:22:00.419]  Let's also be clear.
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:03.181]  The future is not just happening.
[00:22:04.022 --> 00:22:05.543]  The future is built by us.
[00:22:06.804 --> 00:22:10.708]  By a powerful community as you here in this room.
[00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:15.892]  We have the means to improve the state of the world.
[00:22:17.133 --> 00:22:19.555]  But two conditions are necessary.
[00:22:20.498 --> 00:22:28.823]  The first one is that we act all as stakeholders of larger communities.
[00:22:29.803 --> 00:22:34.726]  That we serve not our only self-interests, but we serve the community.
[00:22:35.666 --> 00:22:38.608]  That's what we call stakeholder responsibility.
[00:22:39.428 --> 00:22:41.569]  And second, that we collaborate.
[00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:49.234]  And this is the reason why you find many opportunities here during the meeting to engage.
[00:22:50.385 --> 00:23:01.118]  Into very action and impact oriented initiatives to make progress related to specific issues on the global agenda.
[00:23:01.919 --> 00:23:03.601]  So says Nosferatu.
[00:23:04.882 --> 00:23:06.224]  Thus spake Nosferatu.
[00:23:09.361 --> 00:23:10.741]  So we're ganging up on you.
[00:23:10.801 --> 00:23:11.542]  We're coming after you.
[00:23:11.642 --> 00:23:12.622]  Oh, we're the stakeholders.
[00:23:12.662 --> 00:23:19.663]  You mean all the big tech billionaires that pay almost zero tax and fly around on private jets but say we have to starve to death?
[00:23:20.243 --> 00:23:25.405]  That then organize themselves to rape us and de-industrialize us?
[00:23:26.445 --> 00:23:28.625]  Because they're helping the communities.
[00:23:28.645 --> 00:23:31.666]  They're helping by getting rid of the populations.
[00:23:31.686 --> 00:23:36.227]  When we come back, they go on to talk about living.
[00:23:38.524 --> 00:23:43.485]  And life after the Great Reset, how the WEF is dealing with Debo's critics.
[00:23:43.685 --> 00:23:51.407]  Oh, they spend a lot of time their first day, it's still ongoing, talking about how they're going to crush resistance and how they're going to censor us.
[00:23:51.627 --> 00:23:52.748]  Oh, what good guys.
[00:23:53.028 --> 00:23:54.528]  They're going to crush the populace.
[00:23:54.828 --> 00:23:57.049]  They're going to crush the people for democracy.
[00:23:57.089 --> 00:23:57.689]  They actually say it.
[00:23:59.349 --> 00:24:04.655]  The Aussies bad people in the nations who are stopping us from the great goal.
[00:24:05.036 --> 00:24:06.037]  A beautiful goal.
[00:24:06.698 --> 00:24:07.919]  We must silence them.
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:09.622]  We must imprison them.
[00:24:10.082 --> 00:24:11.644]  We must annihilate them!
[00:24:12.505 --> 00:24:13.526]  Ha ha ha!
[00:24:15.248 --> 00:24:17.031]  I'm gonna turn on the juice boy.
[00:24:17.051 --> 00:24:18.512]  Be right back.
[00:24:20.484 --> 00:24:36.202]  I was already planning to come into this segment and talk about the 5,000 military and over 5,000 police to guard the Davos criminals, not from the virus they cooked up and released on the world or their new monkeypox scare, but from we the people.
[00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:58.771]  And as we're getting ready to come out of the break and talk about that, they show me the video of Savannah Hernandez on the ground with Jack Posobiec, naval intelligence, no criminal record, a top journalist, being detained by men with MP5 machine guns, and the word is being led away.
[00:24:59.192 --> 00:25:00.132]  This is a short clip.
[00:25:00.172 --> 00:25:01.733]  More is coming in because they're uploading these.
[00:25:01.953 --> 00:25:02.714]  Look at these people.
[00:25:03.991 --> 00:25:13.196]  Here in the supposedly free country of Switzerland and what they are doing because they are so worried about real American patriots being there.
[00:25:13.877 --> 00:25:15.598]  This is the secret police of the system.
[00:25:15.618 --> 00:25:22.102]  Oh, but if you're a New York Times journalist, you get brought into the confab, you get financed by it because you're a pet of the system.
[00:25:22.462 --> 00:25:24.483]  Roll this shock video with audio.
[00:25:24.543 --> 00:25:27.445]  This is just a taste of the global police state.
[00:25:27.465 --> 00:25:30.327]  They will bring to every corner of the world if we don't stop them.
[00:25:30.367 --> 00:25:30.727]  Here it is.
[00:25:32.984 --> 00:25:34.485]  I don't know.
[00:25:34.665 --> 00:25:39.849]  I don't think so.
[00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:47.814]  Excuse me, can I ask you why you're detaining this journalist?
[00:25:48.214 --> 00:25:49.735]  Can you put the phone away, please?
[00:25:49.755 --> 00:25:51.396]  Can I ask you why you're detaining this journalist?
[00:25:51.696 --> 00:25:52.757]  I don't answer your question.
[00:25:52.837 --> 00:25:54.918]  Is it not able to report here?
[00:25:56.307 --> 00:25:59.608]  Can I ask you guys why you're being filmed?
[00:25:59.788 --> 00:26:02.309]  Yeah, can you please stop filming?
[00:26:02.349 --> 00:26:03.029]  Then we can talk.
[00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:04.470]  Why do I need to stop filming?
[00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.070]  Because I asked you to.
[00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:09.731]  It's my personal right, because I don't like to be filmed.
[00:26:10.012 --> 00:26:11.352]  And it's a right in Switzerland.
[00:26:12.112 --> 00:26:15.613]  And if I don't want to be... So, pause, back it up 10 seconds.
[00:26:16.153 --> 00:26:23.556]  So there's cameras everywhere, they have secret police questioning you, but they have privacy when they're detaining and then dragging off a journalist.
[00:26:24.602 --> 00:26:25.242]  They're the good guy.
[00:26:25.262 --> 00:26:27.764]  I mean, everything is ass-backwards with these criminals.
[00:26:28.224 --> 00:26:32.326]  And they've always got a woman in charge of the police, because, oh, it's a woman!
[00:26:32.586 --> 00:26:33.667]  Oh, it's liberal!
[00:26:33.907 --> 00:26:35.008]  Like, Tim Cook's gay!
[00:26:35.348 --> 00:26:37.909]  So he runs death camps, but it's like, buddy, he's gay!
[00:26:38.009 --> 00:26:39.710]  I mean, come on, he runs death camps, but he's gay.
[00:26:40.311 --> 00:26:42.272]  So, this is this whole sick world.
[00:26:42.312 --> 00:26:42.692]  Continue.
[00:26:45.504 --> 00:26:47.666]  Can you please stop filming?
[00:26:47.706 --> 00:26:48.627]  Then we can talk.
[00:26:48.667 --> 00:26:49.828]  Why do I need to stop filming?
[00:26:50.308 --> 00:26:51.429]  Because I asked you to.
[00:26:51.569 --> 00:26:53.231]  It's my personal right.
[00:26:53.331 --> 00:26:55.092]  Because I don't like to be filmed.
[00:26:55.372 --> 00:26:56.713]  And it's a right in Switzerland.
[00:26:57.674 --> 00:27:00.276]  If I don't want to be filmed... But should I ask why he's being detained then?
[00:27:00.356 --> 00:27:01.697]  I won't point the camera at you then.
[00:27:02.018 --> 00:27:02.638]  I won't film you.
[00:27:02.658 --> 00:27:06.561]  But I would like to know why this journalist is being detained on public property.
[00:27:06.962 --> 00:27:08.423]  What's detained?
[00:27:08.443 --> 00:27:10.625]  How come he's being surrounded right now?
[00:27:10.645 --> 00:27:11.946]  Is he allowed to leave the area?
[00:27:12.766 --> 00:27:16.007]  We're just making a normal police control.
[00:27:16.427 --> 00:27:19.248]  Because, you know, it's WEF, everything is very sensitive.
[00:27:19.268 --> 00:27:20.949]  Is there a reason he specifically was targeted?
[00:27:21.909 --> 00:27:28.671]  There is a reason, because we have to have a reason to control a person.
[00:27:28.811 --> 00:27:29.592]  What was the reason?
[00:27:29.612 --> 00:27:30.232]  What was he doing?
[00:27:31.508 --> 00:27:33.690]  I don't have to tell you that?
[00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:35.691]  Why are you asking me that?
[00:27:36.111 --> 00:27:42.496]  Because this is, you know, he's, there's many journalists here and I want to know why he specifically is being detained.
[00:27:42.656 --> 00:27:49.901]  There is a reason, but everything is clear now and we're about to leave in just a few seconds.
[00:27:50.221 --> 00:27:50.561]  Thank you.
[00:27:50.601 --> 00:27:50.942]  Okay?
[00:27:52.483 --> 00:27:52.703]  Yeah.
[00:27:52.863 --> 00:27:56.826]  Could you please now, can I ask you please to delete your...
[00:27:59.246 --> 00:28:04.048]  Yeah, we're surveilling you, we're saving everything on you, and then they turn it off and we don't know what's happened.
[00:28:04.068 --> 00:28:07.289]  We're getting intel, things coming in that they were let off.
[00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:11.230]  So we'll find out what happened, but they're coming for you.
[00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:12.830]  They believe they own you.
[00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.191]  They've erased your rights.
[00:28:16.091 --> 00:28:17.512]  So let's go to this clip from this morning.
[00:28:18.755 --> 00:28:23.338]  This is more from the Davos Group announcement of how they're dealing with their critics.
[00:28:24.019 --> 00:28:25.800]  Not just silencing them in cyberspace.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.261]  Not just de-banking them.
[00:28:28.062 --> 00:28:30.383]  Not just declaring us a non-essential subhuman.
[00:28:31.144 --> 00:28:31.744]  That's what that is.
[00:28:31.824 --> 00:28:32.325]  Think about that.
[00:28:32.905 --> 00:28:33.606]  Just out in the open.
[00:28:33.626 --> 00:28:34.626]  You're non-essential.
[00:28:34.666 --> 00:28:35.227]  You're subhuman.
[00:28:35.527 --> 00:28:36.247]  You're worthless.
[00:28:39.049 --> 00:28:40.971]  But how they deal with us, here it is.
[00:28:41.755 --> 00:28:46.120]  Davos, the home of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.
[00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:52.247]  Just imagine the net worth of some of the people that have passed through this building over the last few decades.
[00:28:54.574 --> 00:28:55.934]  Let's just slobber over Bill Gates.
[00:28:56.094 --> 00:29:02.836]  Usually held in this Swiss ski resort in the middle of winter, the pandemic delayed the 2022 edition until spring.
[00:29:03.156 --> 00:29:14.358]  The warmer weather may have melted the snow and ice here in Davos, but as the super-rich get wealthier and anti-establishment sentiment grows, has enthusiasm for this gathering of the global elite gone cold?
[00:29:14.899 --> 00:29:16.799]  The pandemic wasn't bad for everyone.
[00:29:17.119 --> 00:29:25.184]  While many people suffer dramatic health and economic hardships, the wealth of the world's billionaires saw its biggest increase since records began.
[00:29:25.585 --> 00:29:35.211]  Although the global gap between the average incomes of the richest 10% and the poorest 50% has narrowed in recent years, it's a different story for the top 1%.
[00:29:35.852 --> 00:29:40.395]  Since 1995, average wealth has grown at 3.2% per year.
[00:29:41.055 --> 00:29:44.938]  But the richest individuals on Earth grew their wealth at an average of 6-9% per year.
[00:29:47.219 --> 00:29:55.565]  A separate report found that the world's 2,755 billionaires added $5 trillion to their cumulative wealth in 2021.
[00:29:56.205 --> 00:30:07.353]  In the same year, the world's 10 richest people added more than $400 billion to their fortunes, with Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk gaining $121 billion.
[00:30:08.093 --> 00:30:16.779]  Which brings us back to Davos, where many of the world's richest and most powerful people, the majority of whom are men, convene for a week-long get-together.
[00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:22.884]  Even before the pandemic, the event drew protesters campaigning for social justice and climate action.
[00:30:23.324 --> 00:30:26.346]  One of those protesters many years ago was Philip Wilhelm.
[00:30:26.567 --> 00:30:28.868]  These days, however, he's the town's mayor.
[00:30:29.169 --> 00:30:34.473]  How important is the World Economic Forum's yearly meeting to Davos?
[00:30:34.913 --> 00:30:40.156]  I mean it's really important in the sense of name recognition for our alpine city here.
[00:30:40.476 --> 00:30:59.905]  A lot of people know the name Davos because of this event we have here and then there's also in an economical part of view it is important because there's a lot of work for this whole redesign of the Davos Promenade and of course the overstays and so on and they generate a lot of income for local people as well.
[00:31:02.225 --> 00:31:03.527]  So he's been co-opted.
[00:31:03.727 --> 00:31:05.649]  Not that making money is bad, but he's part of the system now.
[00:31:07.171 --> 00:31:10.295]  Again, these people are at war with humanity, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:10.315 --> 00:31:16.483]  They have unlimited bank money they just generate for themselves, but it creates inflation, which they hand to us.
[00:31:16.543 --> 00:31:21.529]  But they get all the infrastructure, and then we get the debt and the crippling tyranny.
[00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:28.335]  I've got more clips when we come back I haven't gotten to yet, and we're also going to hit a lot of the news.
[00:31:28.395 --> 00:31:32.896]  And I've been so focused on covering the news, I didn't even plug Thursday, Friday, or Sunday.
[00:31:32.916 --> 00:31:37.878]  So I'm going to just remind listeners right now that we're not backed by George Soros or Klaus Schwab of the New World Order.
[00:31:38.558 --> 00:31:40.738]  We're backed by the people that love liberty worldwide.
[00:31:40.778 --> 00:31:48.160]  I want to thank folks that have been going to InfoWarsTore.com and buying great products, great supplements, great books, films, you name it.
[00:31:49.284 --> 00:31:51.225]  But also making donations right at the top.
[00:31:51.285 --> 00:31:53.325]  It says support InfoWars.
[00:31:53.345 --> 00:31:56.446]  You can donate one time or sign up to recurring donations.
[00:31:56.486 --> 00:31:57.246]  Cancel any time.
[00:31:57.806 --> 00:31:59.307]  That support free speech button.
[00:32:00.187 --> 00:32:02.268]  We have X2 and Ultra 12.
[00:32:02.408 --> 00:32:04.268]  I've been so busy I haven't gotten rid of the sale.
[00:32:04.749 --> 00:32:06.289]  Even though Ultra 12 is close to selling out.
[00:32:06.369 --> 00:32:07.969]  So I'm going to tell you now.
[00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:10.470]  I've been so busy it won't be till Wednesday till we change the sale.
[00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:14.731]  So tomorrow and Tuesday are the last days to get X2 at 40% off with Ultra 12.
[00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:24.695]  Ultra 12 will stay at 40% off, but that sale, 40% off the two together and 25% off the next two by itself, will have to end tomorrow.
[00:32:24.815 --> 00:32:35.806]  They don't, that very globalist group, back when we had a good government, 50 years ago, 70 years ago, 80 years ago, they started putting, hell, it's 90 years ago now, iodine in the salt, by law.
[00:32:37.067 --> 00:32:39.850]  They took it out in the 70s, and the IQs went way down again.
[00:32:41.069 --> 00:32:43.951]  Fifteen point IQ increase on average iodine and salt.
[00:32:44.211 --> 00:32:46.712]  That's just cruddy iodine, industrial iodine that's bound.
[00:32:47.132 --> 00:32:48.173]  You absorb only a fraction.
[00:32:48.193 --> 00:32:50.394]  This is pure, medical-grade iodine.
[00:32:50.854 --> 00:32:51.715]  Everybody should be taking it.
[00:32:51.735 --> 00:32:52.795]  It supercharges your whole body.
[00:32:52.835 --> 00:32:53.355]  It's essential.
[00:32:53.636 --> 00:32:55.837]  It's really their big conspiracy against us.
[00:32:55.857 --> 00:32:57.838]  They don't just not give us iodine.
[00:32:57.878 --> 00:33:05.262]  They hit us with chlorine, bromide, bromine, and all the rest of them to block fluoride, to block the good halogen.
[00:33:05.662 --> 00:33:07.743]  Get X2 at m4warstore.com while you still can.
[00:33:10.265 --> 00:33:13.548]  Today, we have 10 vaccine manufacturers in India.
[00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:19.495]  We've ensured that every single Indian gets double shot of vaccines.
[00:33:19.975 --> 00:33:22.878]  Today, every Indian is going through his third phase.
[00:33:23.319 --> 00:33:30.506]  We were the first country in the world to export vaccines around in our neighborhood and to other developed countries of the world.
[00:33:31.167 --> 00:33:33.908]  We've done it now after we finished our population.
[00:33:33.928 --> 00:33:35.869]  We are back to exporting our vaccines.
[00:33:36.309 --> 00:33:38.990]  We are determined to be the vaccine capital of the world.
[00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:41.731]  14 other vaccines are in their clinical phases.
[00:33:42.191 --> 00:33:45.913]  We believe that nobody is safe till everybody is not safe.
[00:33:46.333 --> 00:33:50.995]  And we are convinced that Indians will manufacture vaccines for the rest of the world.
[00:33:51.255 --> 00:33:59.458]  And we do not believe that anybody can be safe till we do not provide vaccines to Africa and all other emerging markets of the world.
[00:34:00.478 --> 00:34:05.019]  The truth is, India is totally rejecting the vaccines because they know they're carrying Trojan horse payloads.
[00:34:05.619 --> 00:34:06.420]  That's all of the news.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:11.381]  Bill Gates has been banned with his father, who's now dead, out of India for doing illegal tests that killed a bunch of people.
[00:34:11.421 --> 00:34:11.861]  Look it up.
[00:34:12.541 --> 00:34:13.482]  Sterilants, you name it.
[00:34:13.502 --> 00:34:19.103]  So a group dedicated to world government to depopulate you wants to put something in your body.
[00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:19.783]  Let me say that again.
[00:34:21.104 --> 00:34:24.465]  A group dedicated to depopulating you, to killing you.
[00:34:26.605 --> 00:34:29.566]  The same group pushing, aborting babies after they're born.
[00:34:30.615 --> 00:34:36.318]  The same group pushing the transgender maiming of children.
[00:34:36.958 --> 00:34:39.340]  You know, you come to the doctor and say, doctor, I want to cut my arm off.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:42.181]  I want to cut my foot off.
[00:34:42.201 --> 00:34:43.162]  I want to cut my finger off.
[00:34:43.202 --> 00:34:44.142]  They say, you're mentally ill.
[00:34:44.162 --> 00:34:45.163]  I'm going to call a paddy wagon.
[00:34:46.886 --> 00:34:48.346]  We're going to go to the local lunatic asylum.
[00:34:49.047 --> 00:34:52.388]  Doctor, I want to have my five-year-old's penis and testicles cut off.
[00:34:52.428 --> 00:34:53.668]  Well, my God, you're a hero.
[00:34:53.708 --> 00:34:54.809]  Let's get that done right now.
[00:34:55.329 --> 00:34:56.369]  Let that sink in.
[00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:57.990]  They're the authors of it all.
[00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:01.551]  I've got the clips here where they're like, LGBT for the children!
[00:35:01.571 --> 00:35:02.811]  Age three!
[00:35:02.911 --> 00:35:04.512]  Teach them to have sex with the other sex!
[00:35:05.352 --> 00:35:13.174]  To destroy the family, ladies and gentlemen, doesn't mean we hate somebody because they love somebody or have sex with the same sex.
[00:35:13.335 --> 00:35:14.215]  I don't hate people.
[00:35:15.522 --> 00:35:16.723]  The media always spins it.
[00:35:18.024 --> 00:35:20.966]  That Jones wants to kill transgenders, Jones hates, whatever.
[00:35:21.286 --> 00:35:22.246]  That is not true.
[00:35:23.187 --> 00:35:27.550]  I want children left alone by heterosexuals, homosexuals, everybody.
[00:35:27.830 --> 00:35:29.431]  Because when you mess with children, it has a name.
[00:35:29.911 --> 00:35:31.452]  It's called pedophilia.
[00:35:32.252 --> 00:35:33.253]  And it's called evil.
[00:35:33.573 --> 00:35:36.375]  And all the numbers show it ruins children's lives.
[00:35:36.435 --> 00:35:39.457]  It's the worst thing that can happen to a child.
[00:35:40.177 --> 00:35:41.478]  And we know that other than being killed.
[00:35:42.919 --> 00:35:44.160]  Hell, it may be a fate worse than death.
[00:35:45.784 --> 00:35:50.784]   it's rampant and it's satanic and it's a disease a spiritual disease ladies and
[00:35:50.784 --> 00:36:02.250]   gentlemen we have dr. Fleming in studio Gosh, I got a whole file here.
[00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:02.970]  It just fell out.
[00:36:03.651 --> 00:36:04.791]  Ugh, it's heavy to pick up.
[00:36:05.451 --> 00:36:10.013]  Whole file of this whole world government treaty.
[00:36:11.636 --> 00:36:16.318]  And the next rollout, the monkeypox, the next lockdowns, all of it.
[00:36:16.338 --> 00:36:18.819]  We've got a Richard Fleming coming up.
[00:36:20.499 --> 00:36:21.740]  Major new information.
[00:36:24.541 --> 00:36:25.001]  Next hour.
[00:36:27.102 --> 00:36:32.744]  So you do not want to miss that life-saving, freedom-promoting information.
[00:36:32.784 --> 00:36:42.081]   But continuing here, let's shift gears into Joe Biden in A statement to Japan.
[00:36:44.042 --> 00:36:49.465]  When it comes to gas prices, we're going through an incredible transition.
[00:36:49.485 --> 00:36:50.205]  I'm going to play that.
[00:36:51.306 --> 00:36:59.991]  But first I'm going to play Joe Biden tells reporters in Japan, US will get involved in a military operation to defend Taiwan.
[00:37:01.371 --> 00:37:16.379]  And what that statement means, while all the policies are to let China take over Taiwan, we're already taking over Hong Kong, and what that signifies, here is the puppet in chief, the placeholder for Obama's third administration.
[00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:21.922]  You didn't want to get involved in the Ukraine conflict militarily for obvious reasons.
[00:37:22.463 --> 00:37:26.625]  Are you willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan if it comes to that?
[00:37:27.125 --> 00:37:27.385]  Yes.
[00:37:28.206 --> 00:37:28.486]  You are?
[00:37:30.572 --> 00:37:31.613]  That's the commitment we made.
[00:37:34.517 --> 00:37:40.023]  Now, we all remember Obama when he was running for president saying, you can build a coal plant but we will bankrupt you.
[00:37:40.343 --> 00:37:44.808]  Well now it's the gas plants and it's everything else and it's the drilling shutdown and the pipelines.
[00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:58.828]   And we saw the head of the Department of Energy Come out earlier last year and say, yeah, we could lower gas prices.
[00:37:59.468 --> 00:38:05.712]  We're deliberately doing it as part of a transition to electric cars, even though most of their power comes from coal.
[00:38:05.812 --> 00:38:06.913]  And they're going to shut that off.
[00:38:07.193 --> 00:38:09.775]  And now they're announcing rolling blackouts and not enough electricity.
[00:38:10.175 --> 00:38:12.376]  Figuring out what's happening here is pretty easy.
[00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:23.484]  Agenda 21, 1992, 30 years ago, the treaty, never ratified, but signed on by the bureaucracy, the Carnegie Endowment, the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:38:24.505 --> 00:38:25.685]  Create a post-industrial world.
[00:38:25.726 --> 00:38:33.769]  They didn't just go have meetings and do this because they're playing ping pong or tiddlywinks or a game of horseshoes or pool.
[00:38:35.669 --> 00:38:37.130]  Or maybe pin the tail on the donkey.
[00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:38.451]  No.
[00:38:38.971 --> 00:38:40.031]  This is real.
[00:38:40.091 --> 00:38:40.992]  This isn't a game.
[00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:42.852]  This isn't Pac-Man.
[00:38:43.193 --> 00:38:44.493]  It's not Super Mario Brothers.
[00:38:44.813 --> 00:38:45.954]  It's not Donkey Kong.
[00:38:46.834 --> 00:38:48.655]  It's not World of Warcraft.
[00:38:48.875 --> 00:38:50.115]  It's not Grand Theft Auto.
[00:38:50.255 --> 00:38:51.956]  It's the real world!
[00:38:52.616 --> 00:38:53.877]  It's happening now!
[00:38:55.776 --> 00:38:59.397]  And here's Biden, saying, yeah, it's a transition.
[00:38:59.937 --> 00:39:01.138]  It's all by design.
[00:39:01.278 --> 00:39:01.858]  They admit it is.
[00:39:04.238 --> 00:39:07.099]  And they don't care if it's super unpopular because of election fraud.
[00:39:07.359 --> 00:39:17.882]  And they're intending in 169 days to steal the midterms with the same mules and the same techniques, because no media will cover it other than independent folks like Dinesh Yusuf and Infowars.
[00:39:18.623 --> 00:39:19.783]  Hell, Newsmax won't even cover it.
[00:39:21.563 --> 00:39:22.784]  OAN's been banned off cable.
[00:39:23.936 --> 00:39:24.857]  But how do you fight back?
[00:39:24.917 --> 00:39:30.301]  You magnify InfoWars.com and our video and audio feeds and our reports at Bandai Video.
[00:39:30.321 --> 00:39:32.442]  You magnify OAN that didn't back down.
[00:39:34.364 --> 00:39:37.706]  And you magnify the broadcast, not for them, for you!
[00:39:39.628 --> 00:39:42.750]  When you spread the word, you're fighting the enemy.
[00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:49.155]  When you word of mouth, you're overcoming their main weakness, which is the truth.
[00:39:50.836 --> 00:39:51.517]  So here's Biden.
[00:39:53.325 --> 00:39:55.126]  He doesn't know when he's in a meeting and when he's in public.
[00:39:55.146 --> 00:39:56.468]  He's just reading, yeah, it's a transition.
[00:39:56.828 --> 00:39:57.168]  Here it is.
[00:39:57.188 --> 00:40:14.002]  And when it comes to the gas prices, we're going through an incredible transition that is taking place that God willing, when it's over, we'll be stronger and the world will be stronger and less reliant on fossil fuels when this is over.
[00:40:16.604 --> 00:40:19.546]  And again, just in case you think I'm making it up, we've got all the clips.
[00:40:19.686 --> 00:40:25.849]  Obama went to Africa in the last year of his administration, and South America, and said, you can't have air conditioning in your car.
[00:40:25.869 --> 00:40:27.890]  That's why he flew in on a private jet, or government jet.
[00:40:29.751 --> 00:40:33.113]  And all these people flying today, boats on these, and Prince Philip, and Prince Charles, and all of them.
[00:40:33.493 --> 00:40:34.194]  Prince Philip's dead now.
[00:40:37.028 --> 00:40:39.149]  The hypocrisy is just ridiculous.
[00:40:39.209 --> 00:41:00.980]  It's like Bono, with these old globalist things, is like, cool, he's totally uncool, gives 1% of the money he raises for African food, and he keeps it all, and it's like, cute, because the media doesn't report on it, but everybody knows, pink sunglasses and all, that he is the worst of the worst, has a special reservation and a special place in hell prepared for him.
[00:41:02.100 --> 00:41:04.962]  So, here is Obama.
[00:41:06.189 --> 00:41:08.631]  So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can.
[00:41:09.251 --> 00:41:17.117]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.
[00:41:18.418 --> 00:41:27.585]  That will also generate billions of dollars that we can invest in solar, wind, biodiesel, and other alternative energy approaches.
[00:41:28.706 --> 00:41:32.549]  The only thing that I've said with respect to coal, I haven't been some coal booster.
[00:41:32.769 --> 00:41:48.937]   What I have said is that For us to take coal off the table as an ideological matter, as opposed to saying if technology allows us to use coal in a clean way, we should pursue it.
[00:41:49.717 --> 00:41:50.178]  Which is done.
[00:41:51.929 --> 00:41:53.270]  That, I think, is the right approach.
[00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:56.051]  The same with respect to nuclear.
[00:41:56.591 --> 00:42:05.095]  Right now, we don't know how to store nuclear waste wisely, and we don't know how to deal with some of the safety issues that remain.
[00:42:05.555 --> 00:42:08.877]  And so it's wildly expensive to pursue nuclear energy.
[00:42:09.737 --> 00:42:19.601]  But, I tell you what, if we could figure out how to store it safely, then I think most of us would say that might be a good idea.
[00:42:21.937 --> 00:42:36.864]  You know, many, many years ago, 15, 16 years ago, trying to sound reasonable, but all coal puts out is carbon dioxide and water, so they listed carbon dioxide as a pollutant, even though plants breathe it, and then put out oxygen.
[00:42:37.725 --> 00:42:40.246]  So she says, oh, you can have coal, it's just got to be clean.
[00:42:40.566 --> 00:42:43.468]  Well, it is completely clean with US systems, with the scrubbers.
[00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:46.675]  China, though, builds one every few days.
[00:42:47.216 --> 00:42:48.336]  Literally, they build like three a week.
[00:42:49.016 --> 00:42:50.936]  And there's no big complex.
[00:42:50.996 --> 00:42:55.957]  It just burns, turns the water turbine, and sends the mercury and all the toxins of the year.
[00:42:56.558 --> 00:42:58.078]  With a coal power plant in the U.S.
[00:42:58.198 --> 00:43:03.439]  and the ones they had in England, you see all that giant complex, like a battleship attached to it, all those tubes and things?
[00:43:03.859 --> 00:43:04.819]  It's called scrubbers.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:11.281]  Totally clean, and everything that comes out of it they can use as a distillate for other key things in industry.
[00:43:12.515 --> 00:43:15.659]  All right, hour number two, straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.263]  Tomorrow's news today, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:43:18.583 --> 00:43:19.905]  We're selling out of X2.

[00:44:29.572 --> 00:44:32.752]  Now take action and get your bottle of Ultra 12.
[00:44:32.731 --> 00:45:00.831]  12. InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:07.490]   Many of us didn't see it yet in early 2020. But today, millions of us are now aware of
[00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:13.891]   the emerging one-world government and their deceitful plans to seize power hidden under
[00:45:13.891 --> 00:45:15.692]  the guise of world health.
[00:45:15.692 --> 00:45:16.532]  (upbeat music)
[00:45:16.793 --> 00:45:26.499]  And many of us are now awake to the fact that this so-called New World Order is religiously paganistic, luciferic, and satanic.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:39.927]  So it's no surprise that their coronation ball climaxes on May 28th with a devil-horned moon and the Jupiter-Mars conjunction, which is believed to bring success when starting a war.
[00:45:41.128 --> 00:45:55.104]  Their big week of megalomania begins on May 22nd in Switzerland with both the World Health Organization's annual World Health Assembly and the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos.
[00:45:56.005 --> 00:46:10.654]  In Geneva, the WHO will be voting on a pandemic treaty known officially as the Zero Draft Report of the Working Group on Strengthening WHO Preparedness and Response to Health Emergencies.
[00:46:11.674 --> 00:46:18.097]  This pandemic treaty will make them the directing and coordinating authority on international health.
[00:46:19.197 --> 00:46:34.123]  The WHO's Zero Draft Plan includes regular simulation exercises, global surveillance, more vaccines, more censorship, contact tracing, and digital vaccine passports.
[00:46:35.503 --> 00:46:43.011]  In Davos, Klaus Schwab's World Economic Forum's annual meeting theme is History at a Turning Point.
[00:46:43.792 --> 00:46:51.680]  Their agenda includes more vaccines, more censorship, and more LGBTQI resilience.
[00:46:52.992 --> 00:47:17.590]  The same week in Indonesia, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction is holding their annual Global Platform, where they will be planning for regular ongoing pandemic simulations, more global governance, more money to fight climate change, and ultimately accomplishing the United Nations 2030 Agenda, also known as the Great Reset.
[00:47:18.971 --> 00:47:32.025]  After the New World Order's narcissistic coronation week ends, with the devil-horned moon and the Jupiter-Mars conjunction, Klaus Schwab and his fellow Satanists can celebrate with their friends at CERN.
[00:47:32.946 --> 00:47:33.446]  And then what?
[00:47:34.497 --> 00:47:45.866]  In March of 2021, the Nuclear Threat Initiative conducted a tabletop exercise simulating a global pandemic involving a monkeypox terrorist attack.
[00:47:46.827 --> 00:47:49.609]  Something that Bill Gates has told us to expect.
[00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:59.275]  The Biden administration has just bought millions of doses of monkey pox vaccines and mysterious cases are now being reported.
[00:47:59.295 --> 00:48:05.438]  The final assault of the new world order will involve a man-made bio attack.
[00:48:06.318 --> 00:48:11.683]  Food shortages, FEMA camps, rolling blackouts, and endless riots.
[00:48:12.824 --> 00:48:19.490]  Violence may save your life someday, and it might save our freedom, but it's not a solution.
[00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:31.701]  If we really wanted to solve this problem, we could all peacefully convene at our local government council and demand either their allegiance to the Constitution or their immediate resignation.
[00:48:32.421 --> 00:48:36.925]  Because the New World Order is not going to surrender, and the entire U.S.
[00:48:36.965 --> 00:48:38.686]  government is under their control.
[00:48:40.067 --> 00:48:47.773]  This coming Memorial Day, remember and honor the ancestors who died for our freedom, because it may very well be our last.
[00:48:48.073 --> 00:48:53.838]  Here we need a vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector.
[00:48:54.518 --> 00:48:59.842]  It offers the only real prospect of achieving fundamental economic transition.
[00:49:00.737 --> 00:49:03.259]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:18.100]  [Music]
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:22.100]   If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:32.100]  [Music]
[00:49:32.100 --> 00:49:39.100]   In the last 60 years, many patriots like Jim Tucker fought hard to expose the fact that there was a global
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:44.100]   private corporate cabal that called themselves the Bilderberg Group,
[00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:48.100]   establishing the total takeover of society using biomedical tyranny,
[00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:51.100]  a world ID, and then forced depopulation.
[00:49:51.404 --> 00:50:04.555]   Footage you're looking at here is footage I shot with a super zoom digital camera of David Rockefeller and others in 1996 in Canada meeting in Ottawa And back then the media said we were insane.
[00:50:04.595 --> 00:50:06.517]  The meeting was not even happening.
[00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:08.619]  Well, now the meeting is out in the open.
[00:50:08.659 --> 00:50:09.841]  They created the Davos Group.
[00:50:10.281 --> 00:50:12.644]  They're launching this biomedical tyranny takeover.
[00:50:13.124 --> 00:50:16.488]  He was on Skype with us a week or so ago, but he's here in studio.
[00:50:16.888 --> 00:50:18.730]  Fellow Texan, Dr. Richard Fleming.
[00:50:19.231 --> 00:50:20.412]  I won't go over his whole background.
[00:50:20.472 --> 00:50:24.717]  Cardiologist, nuclear cardiologist, certified positron emission tomography.
[00:50:25.637 --> 00:50:50.311]  Juris Prudence, doctor, law researcher, inventor, and author, and he's been at the tip of the spear with this amazing website, TheFlemingMethod.com, or FlemingMethod.com, laying out all the graphs, all the documents of what this so-called shot is and what it's doing, and predicting that they would come out with new scares, and we have the whole background on the monkeypox, how they're fear-mongering about that, and New York saying mask again, and lockdowns and other things that are unfolding.
[00:50:50.331 --> 00:50:52.632]  This is getting you ready for the transition we're in.
[00:50:53.312 --> 00:50:58.356]  Into the economic collapse and Klaus Schwab's own statements today at Davos, we played last hour.
[00:50:58.376 --> 00:51:18.349]  So I want to get into Crimes Against Humanity and the big tour you guys have and it being one of the keystones of stopping these people and really illustrating what it is, but just in general, monkeypox, Gates saying it would happen a year ago, the vaccine being ordered, it being delivered last week, right on time, and where you think that's all going, Dr. Fleming?
[00:51:18.919 --> 00:51:24.344]  Well, we've got two very important documents that I shared with you just yesterday and this morning.
[00:51:24.825 --> 00:51:39.600]  One is the NTI paper where they've actually conducted the protocols to determine what type of response people would have if an experimental monkeypox virus was actually made with gain-of-function research and released on people.
[00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:50.786]  And they concluded from that that the biggest drawback were countries like the United States who might resist control by the World Health Organization and demand actual evidence of what's going on.
[00:51:50.826 --> 00:51:53.047]  And they called for a no regrets protocol.
[00:51:53.767 --> 00:52:15.280]   So countries like the United States would simply do what they were told to do by the World Health Organization, which the World Health Organization has no legal authority to tell the United States or any other country what to And now Biden has said last week he wants in the treaty that they're secretly preparing right now at the WEF meeting, joint meeting with the UN, where nation states, including the US, have no veto power.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.381]  This is unprecedented.
[00:52:16.861 --> 00:52:17.922]  It is unprecedented.
[00:52:18.122 --> 00:52:27.369]  The Article 6 of the US Constitution says that for a treaty to occur or to be adapted, the President has to sign and Congress has to ratify that.
[00:52:27.849 --> 00:52:32.552]  Congress has looked at both 1948, when we entered World Health Organization, and the 2005 documents.
[00:52:33.993 --> 00:52:39.993]   that the United States does not have to do something just because the World Health Organization calls for it.
[00:52:39.993 --> 00:52:45.493]   And importantly, with the 2005 one, the reservation, which is a critical limiting term on a treaty,
[00:52:45.493 --> 00:52:49.993]   says that it's up to the states and the people, if it's not in the power of the federal government
[00:52:49.993 --> 00:52:56.993]   and it's not in the power of the President of the United States, no matter who he is, to self-execute a treaty.
[00:52:56.993 --> 00:52:59.993]  This is just a massive power grab.
[00:52:59.623 --> 00:53:01.204]  And people ask, well, why are they doing it?
[00:53:01.224 --> 00:53:04.487]  Well, even if they only get half of what they want, they'll do another power grab later.
[00:53:04.507 --> 00:53:07.250]  So they already did the COVID power grab the last 28 months.
[00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:08.892]  Got a lot there, got backed off.
[00:53:08.932 --> 00:53:09.973]  Now the new power grab.
[00:53:10.293 --> 00:53:14.457]  And until they go to jail, until people know they're the ones behind it, there's no hope.
[00:53:14.497 --> 00:53:15.318]  But there's a lot of hope.
[00:53:15.658 --> 00:53:17.120]  Trending number one on Twitter yesterday.
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:19.341]  Bill Gates is one of the people that we want indicted.
[00:53:19.361 --> 00:53:19.901]  We need indictments.
[00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:25.539]   show the first hour, I forget the exact hashtag, but it's Bill Gates bioterrorist.
[00:53:25.539 --> 00:53:27.860]  They can put it on screen, the exact hashtag.
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.579]  So people are really getting this.
[00:53:29.579 --> 00:53:33.021]  Bill Gates is one of the people that we want indicted.
[00:53:33.021 --> 00:53:34.420]  We need indictments.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:39.221]   We need everybody to either come to these Crimes Against Humanity Tour events or go
[00:53:39.221 --> 00:53:44.579]   to my website and pull up letters of indictments and actually submit these to your attorney
[00:53:45.081 --> 00:53:46.783]  This is a win-win for the AGs.
[00:53:47.184 --> 00:53:53.752]  If they don't want these people to be indicted, it's a win for them to turn it over to a grand jury and have the grand jury say, no, we don't want to do it.
[00:53:54.453 --> 00:53:55.895]  If the grand juries do do it...
[00:53:56.713 --> 00:54:04.496]  If they do decide to go ahead, it's a win for the AGs because they can say they've done their job and a lot of these AGs are looking for a political office at some point in time.
[00:54:04.996 --> 00:54:23.682]  This is up to the American people to turn around and force the Attorney Generals of the states, and we have a couple that are very interested right now, and the first one who does it is going to make their name in history as being the first person who stands up for the American people and take these criminals down for the crimes against humanity that they have committed.
[00:54:24.082 --> 00:54:25.643]  These documents are very clear.
[00:54:26.403 --> 00:54:51.705]  This NTI is nothing more than a protocol study that was conducted and carried out to see what the limitations would be and what needed to be done to actually go ahead and effectively manipulate governments and people designed to bring increased lockdowns, vaccinations, masking, social distancing, shutting down businesses without any input from the American people.
[00:54:52.546 --> 00:55:04.613]  This document is a patent that shows that they have actually developed a patent to combine monkeypox with SARS-CoV-2, designed to be a vaccine.
[00:55:05.214 --> 00:55:17.221]  And, you know, this is the most nefarious approach that I could think of doing this, to actually combine something that they claimed is a problem with another virus that we're now seeing cases of.
[00:55:18.081 --> 00:55:19.542]  Right in our face.
[00:55:19.562 --> 00:55:21.483]  The pre-preparation of this, but I heard a record skip.
[00:55:21.503 --> 00:55:24.785]  Some of you travel around the country and crowds of thousands of people at these events.
[00:55:24.646 --> 00:55:28.406]   protocol to determine what it takes to manipulate the American people and
[00:55:28.406 --> 00:55:33.365]   people around the world. Right in our face. Right in our face. The pre-preparation
[00:55:33.365 --> 00:55:36.885]   of this, but I heard a record skip. I mean, travel around the country and crowds of
[00:55:36.885 --> 00:55:42.365]   thousands of people at these events, tens of thousands of some, that you guys now
[00:55:42.365 --> 00:55:47.806]   have some district attorneys, some county attorneys, some grand juries that are
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:57.966]  All we need is a DeSantis, or Governor Abbott, if he would do his job, and others to create a political issue, or Ken Paxton, the Attorney General of Texas, who's overall a good guy.
[00:55:58.666 --> 00:56:02.648]  All we need is them to have a press conference and call for this, and the indictments will come.
[00:56:02.688 --> 00:56:03.529]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:56:03.769 --> 00:56:04.350]  Absolutely.
[00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:11.756]  We've had five focus groups of 20 to 25 people and every one of them has listened to the evidence and said, this is indictable.
[00:56:12.316 --> 00:56:12.897]  And you know what?
[00:56:13.777 --> 00:56:21.043]  This is an opportunity for Bill Gates and Fauci and Collins and all the rest to come forward and defend themselves.
[00:56:21.223 --> 00:56:26.227]  I've actually offered an opportunity more than once to Fauci.
[00:56:27.088 --> 00:56:34.633]  To debate me, live, on Father's Day, the 19th of June, in Tampa, Florida, at the Crimes Against Humanity Tour.
[00:56:35.053 --> 00:56:35.974]  No, we're too busy.
[00:56:36.214 --> 00:56:36.894]  How about Zoom?
[00:56:37.114 --> 00:56:37.775]  How about Skype?
[00:56:37.915 --> 00:56:38.975]  No, he's too busy.
[00:56:39.296 --> 00:56:41.317]  Okay, you name the date, Dr. Fauci.
[00:56:41.597 --> 00:56:43.518]  You name when and where you want to do this.
[00:56:43.858 --> 00:56:52.223]   We will have a discussion because if this is all above board and You've done nothing wrong and you haven't done gain-of-function research and you haven't paid for it.
[00:56:52.624 --> 00:56:54.885]  You should be able to defend that to the American people.
[00:56:55.345 --> 00:56:56.966]  It's either here or it's in court.
[00:56:57.106 --> 00:56:58.367]  And we know what they've really done.
[00:56:58.927 --> 00:57:00.008]  So let's expand on this.
[00:57:00.928 --> 00:57:08.793]  Because this is bombshell here with the evidence that the virus that is in these virus vector vaccines is clearly linked to monkeypox type events.
[00:57:08.813 --> 00:57:09.593]  We have the studies right here.
[00:57:09.614 --> 00:57:10.754]  We'll be going over that next segment.
[00:57:11.314 --> 00:57:14.516]  But going back, elaborate on that because that's big news.
[00:57:14.857 --> 00:57:20.424]   You've got Local governments that are very closely looking at this?
[00:57:20.724 --> 00:57:23.165]  Yes, we've got a couple state attorney generals.
[00:57:23.245 --> 00:57:24.246]  Oh, state attorney generals?
[00:57:24.306 --> 00:57:25.407]  State attorney generals.
[00:57:25.647 --> 00:57:30.389]  A couple state attorney generals who have expressed a strong interest that have been paying attention.
[00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:35.432]  On the website, there's letters to go to them with links for evidence in the book.
[00:57:35.592 --> 00:57:36.933]  Is COVID-19 a bioweapon?
[00:57:37.073 --> 00:57:43.657]  For a deposition that I gave under oath to a real court reporter in the state of Texas, in the city of Dallas.
[00:57:44.497 --> 00:57:59.927]  ...with a real attorney who has argued and won cases before the Supreme Court of the United States that we have an affidavit on the website for people to take and this is evidence in proof that gain-of-function research has been done and paid for in the U.S.
[00:58:00.408 --> 00:58:03.470]  by, through Dr. Anthony Fauci... Stay there, we're going to go to break.
[00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:05.811]  I want to come back and slowly go through this, but let's just be clear.
[00:58:06.411 --> 00:58:11.090]   Senator Rand Paul, in more than what, nine hearings now, has developed the evidence and
[00:58:11.090 --> 00:58:13.090]  said you should be indicted Fauci.
[00:58:13.090 --> 00:58:17.051]   So we have a U.S. Senator saying we have evidence, here's the documents, you did this, you lied
[00:58:17.051 --> 00:58:18.051]  to Congress.
[00:58:18.051 --> 00:58:20.850]   Well if Congress won't act, others can act and it's cut and dry.
[00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:25.411]   And people like Jim Garrison, who basically exposed the whole Kennedy thing in the Court
[00:58:25.411 --> 00:58:32.891]   of Public Opinion, they were convicted, not ever in an actual court, but it took one attorney
[00:58:32.891 --> 00:58:33.891]  in a city.
[00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:38.191]  It took one district attorney to expose the whole JFK thing.
[00:58:38.591 --> 00:58:41.032]  What if we get an attorney general of a major state?
[00:58:41.072 --> 00:58:42.233]  This is incredible.
[00:58:42.593 --> 00:58:45.334]  Dr. Richard Fleming, stay right there at FlemingMethod.com.
[00:58:45.394 --> 00:58:47.074]  I want to, you've given us an incredible prelude.
[00:58:47.094 --> 00:58:48.215]  I'll try to give you the floor when we come back.
[00:58:48.815 --> 00:58:56.323]  And just walk through this section by section because this is all, everything he said is so incredible and it's moving fast and my brain is just on fire right now.
[00:58:56.363 --> 00:58:56.984]  This is amazing.
[00:58:57.004 --> 00:58:59.366]  You can smell the justice and victory.
[00:58:59.406 --> 00:59:00.127]  You can feel it.
[00:59:00.547 --> 00:59:01.188]  You can see it.
[00:59:01.228 --> 00:59:01.889]  You can taste it.
[00:59:01.909 --> 00:59:02.930]  And we've got to implement it.
[00:59:03.250 --> 00:59:05.052]  It's in our hands to stand up to these murderers.
[00:59:05.432 --> 00:59:07.154]  They're counting on us not taking action.
[00:59:07.194 --> 00:59:09.576]  We are taking action now!
[00:59:10.876 --> 00:59:12.558]  It is not a mission impossible.
[00:59:13.359 --> 00:59:17.242]  It is a mission we must and we will carry out and be victorious with.
[00:59:17.262 --> 00:59:24.790]  The children and our whole future as a species demand to stop this corporate global government takeover via biomedical hysteria.
[00:59:25.868 --> 00:59:33.178]  Dr. Richard Fleming is our guest medical doctor, lawyer, you name it, here laying out the truth of what is happening and unfolding.
[00:59:33.218 --> 00:59:36.723]  He just dropped bombshell after bombshell with all the documents last segment.
[00:59:36.743 --> 00:59:42.070]  We're trying to walk through those slowly now while he is in studio with us and then obviously talk about what's coming next.
[00:59:44.264 --> 00:59:52.506]  He was, again, if you just joined us, laying out the fact that there are state attorney generals now looking at the scientific evidence.
[00:59:52.526 --> 00:59:55.847]  You go to his site, it's incredible how it's all put together with their own data.
[00:59:56.647 --> 01:00:03.408]  And we are getting very, very close as they do this Crimes Against Humanity tour with tens of thousands all over the United States.
[01:00:03.448 --> 01:00:06.409]  So, Doctor, take your time and roll this out.
[01:00:06.849 --> 01:00:11.330]  And then we'll also get into the huge monkey pox war game the globalists put on.
[01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:14.832]  Of the same virus, the same scenario, everything unfolding.
[01:00:15.133 --> 01:00:21.258]  The internet's on fire with this as people see Bill Gates saying, oh, monkeypox will be here next year, and they have the vaccine ready.
[01:00:21.298 --> 01:00:23.841]  It's all completely, as you said, in your face.
[01:00:24.724 --> 01:00:30.227]  Well, they've done an excellent job of just making people afraid because viruses are something people don't understand.
[01:00:30.747 --> 01:00:40.252]  But what they forgot to take into account is that scientists and researchers like myself will go back and get the details and get the data about what's been happening for several decades.
[01:00:40.673 --> 01:00:47.877]  The Crimes Against Humanity Tour has focused on a presentation that I'm doing laid out in several parts.
[01:00:48.357 --> 01:00:53.940]  The first part is simply laying out the evidence of where the money came from in the federal government.
[01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.461]  What type of research was done?
[01:00:57.382 --> 01:01:00.603]  What types of papers were published showing that research?
[01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:15.011]  And what types of patents were then granted, not only to Peter Daszak, and Shi Zheng Li, and Ralph Baric, but to the federal government itself, all involved in gain-of-function research.
[01:01:15.091 --> 01:01:24.555]   So gain-of-function research is where Humans go in and intentionally change something that's naturally occurring to make it more infectious and more harmful.
[01:01:25.135 --> 01:01:35.460]  And we've seen a lot of interest develop over this since the Russian invasion of Ukraine with all the biological labs that now makes it obvious that the U.S.
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:37.981]  is involved in these biological weapons laboratories.
[01:01:38.641 --> 01:01:44.480]   Eight of those laboratories are in the Ukraine, are under the control of the Department of
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.721]  Defense.
[01:01:45.721 --> 01:01:50.000]   Our military is controlling eight of the facilities in the Ukraine.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:57.240]   Putin when he was there prior to being kicked out essentially had his own biological agents
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.240]  there.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:02.641]   So you can see how he's upset with that and how this poses a real threat for his agenda.
[01:02:02.641 --> 01:02:06.921]   And now there's American weapons and Ukrainian weapons being developed there.
[01:02:06.921 --> 01:02:10.680]   And in the actual literature, mainline science, none of this is debated.
[01:02:10.701 --> 01:02:12.261]  It's like denying Washington, D.C.
[01:02:12.321 --> 01:02:12.761]  exists.
[01:02:13.142 --> 01:02:20.525]  They just go, oh, none of that's true, none of that's true, even though it's all these government papers, Washington Post articles, five, ten years ago, but now they say it's not happening, even though it's on record.
[01:02:20.825 --> 01:02:37.736]   Everything that's been talked about that suggests that this was naturally occurring, which is a one in three trillion chance, Everything that was done all goes back to Fauci and the people that were connected with him when they first tried to clamp this down and say, no, no, no, this isn't man-made.
[01:02:38.336 --> 01:02:45.262]  Ever since then, every piece of evidence that has come out has shown that this is a man-made violence.
[01:02:45.282 --> 01:02:47.844]  And then it's not just one out of a three trillion that it happened.
[01:02:48.345 --> 01:02:53.749]  It's then the depopulationists and the vaccine makers and these globalists that are involved running it all.
[01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:55.831]  And then we have the documents admitting they made it.
[01:02:56.491 --> 01:02:57.071]  Absolutely.
[01:02:57.111 --> 01:03:10.256]  I mean, we can see what the actual, they're called nucleotide bases, the building blocks of these viruses and of these vaccines, and they match in the most critically damaging part of the vaccines.
[01:03:10.737 --> 01:03:16.039]  The vaccines have not been shown to statistically lower the instance of COVID.
[01:03:16.519 --> 01:03:24.182]  What's happened is that they developed a vaccine based upon the genetic code that was modified for gain-of-function research.
[01:03:25.603 --> 01:03:32.663]   allowed some initial response in humans, so that what we saw up front were a slight reduction
[01:03:32.663 --> 01:03:35.603]   in the number of people who might have gotten sick who got vaccinated,
[01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:40.983]   but now those people are the ones at greatest risk because with the pressure on this virus
[01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:44.802]   to come up with all the variants, the only people that have full immunity
[01:03:44.802 --> 01:03:49.083]   are the people now who've been infected from one person to another who've seen all the variants
[01:03:49.083 --> 01:03:50.403]  and all the parts of the virus.
[01:03:50.403 --> 01:03:54.121]   So that now what the data shows are that the vaccinated people
[01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:57.363]  are tending to have more cases of COVID, the disease.
[01:03:57.363 --> 01:04:01.403]   But you predicted that with a lot of other top scientists, including the former chief scientist at Pfizer
[01:04:01.403 --> 01:04:02.362]  over two years ago.
[01:04:02.362 --> 01:04:03.362]  Yes, yeah.
[01:04:03.362 --> 01:04:08.202]   And you know, I mean, the evidence was sitting there staring us in the face.
[01:04:08.202 --> 01:04:13.163]   We've spent two years looking at this, working on it and trying to make people aware of it.
[01:04:13.163 --> 01:04:17.682]   And the reality is I think they were just hoping that we would all just die or go away,
[01:04:17.682 --> 01:04:18.923]  but that's not gonna happen.
[01:04:18.923 --> 01:04:21.722]  I have no plans of dying or going away anywhere.
[01:04:21.722 --> 01:04:25.483]   And I don't think these state attorney generals are either because as they're beginning
[01:04:25.483 --> 01:04:33.762]   to take a look at this data and see, yes, in fact, Fauci and the rest and Gates and Collins and.
[01:04:34.324 --> 01:04:43.427]  Several of the people that we've listed have been involved in spending American money, even at a time when we supposedly had banned gain-of-function research in this country.
[01:04:43.887 --> 01:04:44.887]  They just exported it.
[01:04:45.527 --> 01:04:48.068]  They exported it to the Ukraine and other countries, yeah.
[01:04:48.328 --> 01:04:49.508]  So let's expand on that.
[01:04:49.568 --> 01:04:54.870]  You have these attorney generals that are off-record getting close, and I've even seen some mainstream media rumblings of that.
[01:04:55.490 --> 01:05:14.196]  How do you not, when it's cut and dry and we have all the emails that people put out via lawsuits, that they did do this, and they called it gain of function, and Fauci put on gain of function conferences, and they approached the Pentagon in 2017 and said, we have this synthetic spike protein we want to spray in China, and the Pentagon said, that can start World War III, and that's the London Telegraph reporting that.
[01:05:14.617 --> 01:05:26.460]   This is all, again, they think we're ignorant, but they're speaking a language they don't think some people can read the language, but you can, and so it looks to me like the monkey pox is obviously the thing they want to use to change the
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:28.000]  subject and make us forget about what happened.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.600]   Absolutely. This patent right here, that second one that I showed you, when you go to the back of it,
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:39.800]   which I know just looks like a bunch of letters because that's really kind of what they are,
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   these are, all these pages are the genetic code actually published,
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:53.100]   published the genetic code of this virus, of this monkeypox virus that has been genetically altered
[01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:56.100]  to also include the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
[01:05:56.011 --> 01:06:00.372]  I mean there's page after page after page of the nuclear code.
[01:06:01.272 --> 01:06:11.776]  That makes up what they're calling a vaccine because it is a combination of SARS-CoV-2, the virus we've all been dealing with for COVID, and monkeypox.
[01:06:12.137 --> 01:06:13.957]  And it's the exact same scenario.
[01:06:13.977 --> 01:06:20.420]  It's just fascinating that it's the exact same scenario that they ran this 201 equivalent design.
[01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:27.784]  I remember you on the show a year ago and others, people said this might cause a monkeypox or give people other monkey-based zoological viruses.
[01:06:27.804 --> 01:06:31.026]  I'm not a virologist, but you know, that's where they think HIV came from.
[01:06:31.606 --> 01:06:38.109]  This was predicted, and then now... Oh yeah, yeah, and it's, you know, what just stuns me is that they're dumb enough to actually continue to go through with it.
[01:06:38.149 --> 01:06:48.055]  But Dr. Fleming, say it in layman's terms, and we've got studies here, there's overwhelming evidence that this so-called monkeybox outbreak everywhere that they can't track, because there's no one place it shows up in the spreads, is the shot.
[01:06:49.236 --> 01:06:52.499]  Well, it certainly... that's what the data would suggest, yeah.
[01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:54.301]  And they knew that?
[01:06:55.502 --> 01:06:57.224]  I don't... Well, they war-gamed it?
[01:06:57.244 --> 01:06:58.526]  They war-gamed it, yeah.
[01:06:58.586 --> 01:07:03.972]  I mean, you know, I mean, it's hard to imagine that they can't know what they actually played games with.
[01:07:04.192 --> 01:07:06.014]  And they war-gamed it exactly as it happened.
[01:07:06.454 --> 01:07:16.496]  Oh yeah, I mean, it's just stunning to actually have the exact example, a man-made monkeypox virus, and that's what the darn patent shows.
[01:07:16.856 --> 01:07:17.056]  Yeah.
[01:07:17.136 --> 01:07:21.037]  Well, it's like sparse 2025, 2028, it's really set 2020, 2023.
[01:07:21.417 --> 01:07:24.077]  It's all even the same tweets, just they just changed the acronyms.
[01:07:24.977 --> 01:07:30.458]  It's all pre-blueprinted, all pre-planned, all incredibly evil.
[01:07:30.678 --> 01:07:33.919]  I think their goal is to make people so afraid that they won't react.
[01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:43.223]  All right, I have probably spent, no exaggeration, since this monkeypox thing kicked off a week ago, 30 hours of research.
[01:07:44.083 --> 01:07:47.825]  So my wife was getting mad at me, you know, staying in the office all day on Saturday and Sunday.
[01:07:48.405 --> 01:07:50.887]  But I had to do it, and it just made my head hurt.
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:55.122]  I mean, total obsession on Monkey Pox by Bill Gates.
[01:07:55.643 --> 01:08:02.567]  Vaccines, war games of exactly what's happening, them promoting new lockdowns, total hysteria, they got drugs that absolutely treat it.
[01:08:05.149 --> 01:08:06.650]  It's a replay of the whole same thing.
[01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:19.740]   And then Dr. Fleming, who is a cardiologist, a nuclear cardiologist, a certified pastor on admission tomography, and jurisprudence doctor of law, researcher, inventor, and author, super prestigious, you know, and like International TV and U.S.
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:21.461]  top news shows 20 years ago.
[01:08:22.422 --> 01:08:33.872]  A prestigious guy, and he's here crystallizing it, which lets my headache go away, because I'm here as a layperson trying to figure this out, but the good news is Instagram, Twitter, Google, it's the number one thing.
[01:08:34.412 --> 01:08:42.979]  People see this, they point it out, they see the propaganda, they see the studies about this virus they use to inject this DNA into the body.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:56.393]  I want to get back into these war games, there's a bunch of them here, but the big one you brought up that I wasn't even aware of, there's so damn many, run by the very same groups, and then I want to bring up something to you that deals with the issue of courage, and I'm not mad at people.
[01:08:57.409 --> 01:08:59.550]  We can do about 30 minutes the next hour if you can do us, we have plenty of time.
[01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:03.011]  We'll do this next hour, but I want you just to have it, you know, going on in your brain.
[01:09:03.051 --> 01:09:10.693]  I'll tell you off record, I trust you, I trust the crew too, but I never give up sources, so I'll have to, you know, privately go over here with you during the break and tell you.
[01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:32.262]   But I've talked to multiple well-known medical doctor scientist names separately, and I've seen the documents, and Mike Adams reported over a year ago here on the show that they've inserted a bunch of other human and animal DNA In these COVID injections, all four of them, and that it's actually causing mutations and going to be passed on generationally.
[01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:38.165]  And I've talked to top scientists who've been there and seen the evidence at the labs in the U.S.
[01:09:38.205 --> 01:09:38.625]  and Europe.
[01:09:38.986 --> 01:09:40.206]  You probably already know what I'm talking about.
[01:09:40.887 --> 01:09:42.547]  But they're scared to go public.
[01:09:43.028 --> 01:09:45.609]  So at a certain point, scared to go public?
[01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:48.991]  I mean, they're inserting spike protein into our DNA.
[01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:50.211]  Or is that accurate?
[01:09:51.414 --> 01:09:57.438]  Well, what's going on is the genetic code for that spike protein is getting into the DNA.
[01:09:57.818 --> 01:09:58.738]  And we've shown this now.
[01:09:59.279 --> 01:10:01.580]  There's two major papers that we actually published.
[01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:06.083]  The first one was just preliminary back in 2020 and then later on in 2020, 2021.
[01:10:08.064 --> 01:10:17.850]  We showed research that was published that showed in all but three pairs of chromosomes, the genetic code sequence for SARS-CoV-2 is getting inserted.
[01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:20.071]  And it's the same thing that HIV did.
[01:10:20.151 --> 01:10:21.652]  It's a reverse transcription.
[01:10:21.712 --> 01:10:25.714]  So when DNA becomes RNA, it's called transcription.
[01:10:26.174 --> 01:10:29.896]  And when RNA becomes DNA, it's called reverse transcription.
[01:10:30.076 --> 01:10:30.857]  Stop there!
[01:10:31.257 --> 01:10:36.120]  I want to give you 30 minutes next hour, if you want us to print any documents or anything, because I know it's all in your head.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.161]  This is huge, obviously.
[01:10:38.181 --> 01:10:38.962]  I want you to hit that 10, okay?
[01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:39.222]  Okay.
[01:10:39.242 --> 01:10:44.245]  I'm going to shut up now for the rest of the segment, get back to the war games, and then what you think is coming with the monkey box.
[01:10:44.606 --> 01:10:47.788]  Okay, well, you know, this document is really interesting.
[01:10:48.428 --> 01:10:55.593]  One of the major premises of this document is that gain-of-function biological weapons are being made.
[01:10:56.414 --> 01:11:02.759]  Now, we've spent two years with Anthony Fauci and everybody in the federal government saying, no, we don't make these types of weapons.
[01:11:03.579 --> 01:11:10.841]  The premise of this document is these types of weapons are being made and now a rogue nation releases it.
[01:11:10.901 --> 01:11:17.144]  So as I read this as a JFK kid from the training that I had, only two scenarios could pop into my brain.
[01:11:17.564 --> 01:11:17.784]  Either...
[01:11:18.803 --> 01:11:26.455]  There's something going on in the Ukraine that they're afraid could be let out by a very upset Putin or someone along his lines.
[01:11:26.655 --> 01:11:27.997]  Or they could false flag it and blame him.
[01:11:28.197 --> 01:11:29.820]  Or they're going to false flag it and blame him.
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.602]  The Russians have said that's coming.
[01:11:32.083 --> 01:11:34.447]  And they said that a month ago and now it's started.
[01:11:34.767 --> 01:11:48.076]  The problem is, as an American citizen, as somebody who's a Viking Pureblood, who's an American citizen, to have to sit there and look at Putin and listen to what he's saying, going, the man, wow, how sad this is.
[01:11:48.176 --> 01:11:55.015]   So, you know, the problem is that Americans have allowed this type of problem to occur
[01:11:55.015 --> 01:11:59.816]   by allowing our elected officials to run amok and do whatever they want to do.
[01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:05.496]   And it's contingent upon the American public to hold our elected leaders and people that
[01:12:05.496 --> 01:12:08.215]  aren't elected but are appointed accountable.
[01:12:08.215 --> 01:12:10.735]  That's what the U.S. Constitution says.
[01:12:10.735 --> 01:12:13.375]  That's what the Declaration of Independence says.
[01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:14.816]  We the people.
[01:12:14.816 --> 01:12:21.096]   The 2005 document on this World Health Organization treaty says, quite specifically, that the
[01:12:21.606 --> 01:12:30.609]  Congress reserved that this 2005 document says that we apply the rules of federalism, which means if it's not in the U.S.
[01:12:30.669 --> 01:12:34.351]  Constitution, all of this goes to the state and the people.
[01:12:34.391 --> 01:12:34.871]  Tenth Amendment!
[01:12:35.391 --> 01:12:37.693]  Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.
[01:12:38.273 --> 01:12:43.777]  Something that is not clearly stated as a federal power belongs to the people and the states.
[01:12:44.077 --> 01:12:50.782]  I'm going to say it that way, not states and people, because the people give the power to the states, the states give the power to the federal government.
[01:12:50.862 --> 01:12:58.287]  If you as an American citizen don't have that power, you can't give it to the state and the state can't give it to the federal government.
[01:12:58.647 --> 01:13:04.668]  Well, the people have given the power to the states and the state attorney generals to hold these criminals accountable.
[01:13:04.729 --> 01:13:29.085]   And so, in the Crimes Against Humanity Tour, in addition to pointing out the treaties that have been violated, the Biological Weapons Convention Treaty, the Declaration of Helsinki, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Nuremberg Code, not to mention a whole bunch of medical violations for physicians under the AMA, you know.
[01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:38.452]   Now these individuals, not only that, but are then under state laws accountable for murder, Attempted murder.
[01:13:39.133 --> 01:13:39.914]  Manslaughter.
[01:13:40.435 --> 01:13:41.496]  Reckless manslaughter.
[01:13:41.516 --> 01:13:48.244]  Just think of Governor Cuomo following you in directives to send in sick people into nursing homes while the families are kept out so they can carry out the killing.
[01:13:48.605 --> 01:13:51.268]  Yeah, and at no point in time did any of that help anybody.
[01:13:51.568 --> 01:13:55.053]  Keeping the families out of hospitals didn't cut down COVID.
[01:13:55.913 --> 01:14:09.977]  The Johns Hopkins study very clearly pointed out that the same study that Fauci should have been telling Trump back in January 2020, but the study was done by the National Science Foundation in 2007, was to shut down international travel.
[01:14:09.997 --> 01:14:12.078]  Did Anthony Fauci tell the President of the United States?
[01:14:12.098 --> 01:14:13.438]  No, he told him to keep it open.
[01:14:13.478 --> 01:14:14.379]  He told him to keep it open.
[01:14:14.699 --> 01:14:21.890]   So either Anthony Fauci as head of NIAID, was unaware of a major paper that was published on this
[01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.579]  topic, which doesn't bode well for him.
[01:14:23.579 --> 01:14:26.579]   Or he read it and didn't understand it, which doesn't bode well for him.
[01:14:26.579 --> 01:14:30.579]   Or he understood it and refused to take and give that information to the President of the United States,
[01:14:30.579 --> 01:14:32.579]  which doesn't bode well for him.
[01:14:32.579 --> 01:14:35.579]  Anthony, none of these things bode well for you.
[01:14:35.579 --> 01:14:40.579]   Again, anytime, anyplace, anywhere, you want to have a discussion for the American people to see,
[01:14:40.579 --> 01:14:45.579]   because just little old me, I'm certain yet you're not afraid of me any more than you are of Gary Loewe.
[01:14:45.579 --> 01:14:48.579]   This is not a "take your challenge," he only does rigged interviews.
[01:14:48.579 --> 01:14:53.579]   But the issue is here, we have Senator Paul, as I mentioned earlier, in nine hearings,
[01:14:53.579 --> 01:14:55.579]  giving all the evidence, saying you should be indicted.
[01:14:56.225 --> 01:14:58.887]  That should really help with attorney generals at state levels.
[01:15:00.027 --> 01:15:01.748]  It's a clear communication.
[01:15:02.169 --> 01:15:19.759]   We've got the documents, it's in the book, we present it, that shows the NIAID provided research funding that Dr. Barrick at the University of North Carolina got a patent on for the purpose of doing gain-of-function of spike proteins of coronaviruses.
[01:15:19.839 --> 01:15:22.880]  That's just the death knell in the coffin.
[01:15:23.240 --> 01:15:24.200]  You can't sit there.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:33.043]  Fauci cannot sit there before Dr. Senator Rand Paul and say, NIAID does not sponsor research for gain of function of coronavirus.
[01:15:33.063 --> 01:15:39.905]  And now we can't have the very same people that cooked up the last thing and did it do it again and then again they're connected to the very same studies and preparing this?
[01:15:40.245 --> 01:15:44.849]  Yeah, well, they're now doing it with monkeypox, connecting it with SARS-CoV-2.
[01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:46.391]  They're running the scenarios.
[01:15:46.431 --> 01:15:47.612]  They know what needs to be done.
[01:15:47.652 --> 01:15:49.073]  They're expecting you to be afraid.
[01:15:49.093 --> 01:15:51.856]  They're expecting you not to go to your elected officials.
[01:15:52.276 --> 01:16:01.885]  So the two tasks are, go to the state attorney generals to get grand jury indictments, and go to your elected senators and House of Representatives and say, we put you in office.
[01:16:02.546 --> 01:16:07.167]  We expect you to honor the Constitution of the United States and our rights as U.S.
[01:16:07.207 --> 01:16:07.668]  citizens.
[01:16:07.888 --> 01:16:14.089]  At no point in time did I, or any American citizen I know of, vote for anybody at the World Health Organization.
[01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:15.370]  I didn't give them power.
[01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:17.130]  I didn't give them power over my children.
[01:16:17.170 --> 01:16:19.191]  No tax exemption without representation!
[01:16:19.631 --> 01:16:20.491]  That's what led to this.
[01:16:20.631 --> 01:16:27.134]  One of the major things that led to this country being founded was the abuse of power by people that needed to be held accountable.
[01:16:27.715 --> 01:16:29.896]  The Nazis thought they couldn't be held accountable.
[01:16:30.936 --> 01:16:33.117]  The kings of England thought they couldn't be held accountable.
[01:16:33.377 --> 01:16:34.598]  Every one of these people... That's right.
[01:16:34.618 --> 01:16:35.778]  They do this over and over again, folks.
[01:16:35.798 --> 01:16:36.739]  They will be defeated.
[01:16:37.079 --> 01:16:38.739]  The question is, how hellish does it have to get?
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:44.262]  Yeah, and they're not... For some reason, they're of the fantasy that they can make you afraid enough.
[01:16:44.322 --> 01:16:48.644]  And at this point in time, instead of being afraid, you should be ticked off.
[01:16:49.801 --> 01:16:50.141]  Exactly.
[01:16:50.161 --> 01:16:50.642]  I'm not afraid.
[01:16:50.682 --> 01:16:51.142]  I'm pissed.
[01:16:52.043 --> 01:16:52.584]  You should be.
[01:16:53.104 --> 01:16:53.765]  Dr. Richard Fleming.
[01:16:53.805 --> 01:16:54.826]  FlemingMethod.com.
[01:16:54.866 --> 01:16:55.807]  FlemingMethod.com.
[01:16:55.867 --> 01:16:56.408]  Share that link.
[01:16:56.488 --> 01:16:57.289]  It is dynamite.
[01:16:57.589 --> 01:16:58.610]  You want to research, it's there.
[01:16:58.670 --> 01:16:59.431]  FlemingMethod.com.
[01:17:00.332 --> 01:17:03.074]  Right before we went live, I said, Dr. Fleming, what do you want to hit next?
[01:17:04.249 --> 01:17:09.352]  And it was literally simpatico, synchronicity, serendipity.
[01:17:10.133 --> 01:17:13.315]  It's what I was about to bring up next, because we've got to cover this virus.
[01:17:13.335 --> 01:17:15.176]  We've got to cover monkeypox, our next takeover.
[01:17:15.917 --> 01:17:17.598]  People were asleep before, they're awake now.
[01:17:17.618 --> 01:17:21.340]  We weren't asleep, but this article's from ZeroHedge.com.
[01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:22.721]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:17:23.342 --> 01:17:24.842]  Biden misspeaks.
[01:17:25.803 --> 01:17:29.927]  In a vow to respond militarily if China attacks Taiwan, White House walks it back.
[01:17:30.687 --> 01:17:31.508]  To have a U.S.
[01:17:31.568 --> 01:17:44.239]  President corrected daily by the bureaucrats, and to have a total collapse at the White House press conferences where they got to bring in the spokesperson for the Pentagon now, shows this country is in deep trouble.
[01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:48.643]  And you were saying the corrupt power structure that's hijacked our nations is running scared.
[01:17:48.663 --> 01:17:49.604]  Elaborate on that, Dr. Fleming.
[01:17:49.949 --> 01:17:57.479]  Well, it's very clear that these people will do anything to keep from being prosecuted or indicted or called into question in any manner.
[01:17:57.919 --> 01:18:11.952]   You know, when people won't have an honest open debate or discussion or they will change definitions like Dr. Fauci has done with gain of function, You know, during the Crimes Against Humanity Tour, I let people hear Anthony Fauci explain what gain-of-function is.
[01:18:12.072 --> 01:18:17.994]  Then they get to hear him change the definition of gain-of-function and blame other people for it.
[01:18:18.435 --> 01:18:23.517]  And my response when I'm looking at people is, doesn't this sound like when you have children growing up?
[01:18:23.617 --> 01:18:25.818]  And I have three that are 28, 31, and 33.
[01:18:25.918 --> 01:18:32.921]  It sounds like children, when they're trying to get away, convince their parents that they didn't do something wrong.
[01:18:32.961 --> 01:18:34.622]  When they feed the dog, they're...
[01:18:35.462 --> 01:18:36.243]  Their steak.
[01:18:37.824 --> 01:18:38.985]  I just saw you feed the dog.
[01:18:39.005 --> 01:18:39.505]  I didn't know I didn't.
[01:18:39.865 --> 01:18:40.085]  Yeah.
[01:18:40.266 --> 01:18:40.426]  Yeah.
[01:18:40.506 --> 01:18:42.127]  I mean, it's the same phenomenon.
[01:18:42.147 --> 01:18:43.027]  The dog's there at the table.
[01:18:43.048 --> 01:18:43.908]  They're feeding it in front of you.
[01:18:44.048 --> 01:18:44.489]  Yeah.
[01:18:44.849 --> 01:18:46.790]  And the reality is, is that they've been caught.
[01:18:47.291 --> 01:18:48.191]  They know they're caught.
[01:18:48.231 --> 01:18:50.673]  And the question is, who's going to throw who under the bus?
[01:18:50.713 --> 01:18:53.355]  And that's one of the great things about indicting these people.
[01:18:53.775 --> 01:18:54.636]  We're going to find out.
[01:18:54.876 --> 01:18:56.857]  Unfortunately, we're going to find out a lot of things.
[01:18:57.278 --> 01:18:58.118]  It's a it is.
[01:18:58.238 --> 01:19:04.763]  I really hate this wake up call thing, because you should already be functioning as as an American citizen to take responsibility.
[01:19:04.923 --> 01:19:06.704]  It's far beyond people being engaged.
[01:19:06.904 --> 01:19:07.965]  It's life and death now.
[01:19:08.305 --> 01:19:09.425]  They're cutting off the power.
[01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:10.526]  They're imploding the borders.
[01:19:10.786 --> 01:19:13.367]  They're coming with new lockdowns and forced injections.
[01:19:13.727 --> 01:19:19.130]  I know our audience, I'm not lecturing our main audience, but new listeners, I want to love our affiliates.
[01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:23.012]  We've gone from 200 affiliates to over 350 in the last couple of years.
[01:19:23.532 --> 01:19:24.973]  And they don't just put us on at night now.
[01:19:25.273 --> 01:19:26.534]  They go, wow, it's all true.
[01:19:26.554 --> 01:19:27.614]  They put us on during the day.
[01:19:27.634 --> 01:19:30.136]  Because in the old days, we got them ratings, so they put us on.
[01:19:30.156 --> 01:19:31.916]  And they kind of halfway agreed.
[01:19:31.976 --> 01:19:32.837]  Now they know it's real.
[01:19:33.177 --> 01:19:45.422]  Yeah, this document really says they need a way to control countries like the United States so that they can do a tier system so that anything that sounds like it's a problem, they can get the country locked down.
[01:19:45.802 --> 01:19:47.042]  And the country won't question it.
[01:19:47.382 --> 01:19:49.403]  And they'd rather have us overreact.
[01:19:49.543 --> 01:19:51.324]  Literally, they say that in this document.
[01:19:51.484 --> 01:19:51.884]  Overreact.
[01:19:51.904 --> 01:19:57.226]  So this is the Rockefeller Foundation event, event 201, or the early one they did in 2011.
[01:19:57.266 --> 01:19:57.606]  This is 2.0.
[01:19:57.746 --> 01:19:58.387]  This is lockstep.
[01:19:59.747 --> 01:20:03.529]  Yes, they've just been, they figured out what, what the weaknesses were before.
[01:20:03.909 --> 01:20:04.870]  They've adjusted that.
[01:20:04.970 --> 01:20:07.271]  They did their, their testing to see what it would take.
[01:20:07.671 --> 01:20:26.180]  And now the goal is to get all of us to just sit back and acquiesce and let Biden or whoever go in there and modify a treaty that requires Congress to modify the treaty so that we will all just do what a group of people that we don't even know or approve of or have elected or authorized in any manner, take control of our lives.
[01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:40.149]  And it's the very groups financed by Big Pharma and their power grab, but their arrogance is what's going to defeat them because they release all this and do all this and hype up what they already knew was going on from their poison shot right as they're trying to get this treaty through.
[01:20:40.209 --> 01:20:41.910]  I mean, it's ridiculously obvious.
[01:20:42.150 --> 01:20:47.996]  Yeah, they're just hoping that everybody will just let them do whatever they need to do and say, well, there's nothing we can do about it.
[01:20:48.357 --> 01:20:49.057]  Well, you know what?
[01:20:49.237 --> 01:20:49.858]  Yes, there is.
[01:20:49.898 --> 01:20:51.260]  There's a lot you can do about it.
[01:20:51.420 --> 01:20:55.964]  You can go to state attorney generals and demand grand jury indictments.
[01:20:56.345 --> 01:20:59.949]  You can go to your senators and your House of Representatives for the federal government.
[01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:04.353]  You can demand that they do the job that they were called to do under the U.S.
[01:21:04.413 --> 01:21:05.094]  Constitution.
[01:21:04.894 --> 01:21:09.514]   which is to make decisions for the American public. The congressman and
[01:21:09.514 --> 01:21:13.774]   House of Representatives that we have in Washington DC is not put there to
[01:21:13.774 --> 01:21:20.213]   protect Germany or Great Britain or Italy or Switzerland or China or any
[01:21:20.213 --> 01:21:24.474]   other country. They're put there by the American people to protect the
[01:21:24.474 --> 01:21:29.373]  American people under the United States Constitution.
[01:21:27.766 --> 01:21:34.508]  We haven't abdicated that power and authority, and nobody has the power to abdicate unless we allow them to do that.
[01:21:34.608 --> 01:21:36.589]  And that would be the dumbest thing that you can do.
[01:21:36.629 --> 01:21:38.310]  This isn't about you, by the way.
[01:21:38.670 --> 01:21:40.911]  This is about our children and our grandchildren.
[01:21:41.251 --> 01:21:45.753]  And if you want to give them a country that they have no freedoms, I guess go for it.
[01:21:45.793 --> 01:21:47.894]  But I'm personally not going to sit here and take it.
[01:21:48.729 --> 01:21:49.189]  Exactly.
[01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:52.232]  Like Benjamin Franklin said, it's a republic if you can keep it.
[01:21:52.252 --> 01:21:59.597]  So Dr. Fleming, I should have added today, nobody's fault that it wasn't on my list, I asked for Mike Adams to come on this weekend.
[01:21:59.897 --> 01:22:00.518]  He agreed.
[01:22:00.538 --> 01:22:02.759]  I didn't see it on the list so I didn't know Mike was coming up.
[01:22:02.799 --> 01:22:08.424]  Not bashing folks, I just would have hyped up that Mike Adams is coming on to co-host with us in the third hour.
[01:22:09.284 --> 01:22:19.816]  You and Mike Adams, I mean, Mike Adams is the first I saw that said this is not a vaccine, it's a gene therapy, it's going to attack the DNA, it's going to insert all this that's now all being admitted.
[01:22:20.637 --> 01:22:28.906]  And again, I talked to top scientists and doctors, some of them very prominent names, they've gone to the labs, they've seen the results, but the labs are scared to release the evidence.
[01:22:29.707 --> 01:22:41.156]  Yeah, well, everybody's afraid that somebody is going to come after them and punish them, when in reality, the people that are supposed to be punished are the people that did this illegal gain-of-function research in violation of federal treaties.
[01:22:41.176 --> 01:22:43.478]  Exactly, and they're already coming after all of us.
[01:22:43.538 --> 01:22:46.020]  So, why not just say, I'm not looking for a fight.
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:47.922]  Okay, you want to throw down?
[01:22:47.962 --> 01:22:48.642]  Let's just get this.
[01:22:49.083 --> 01:22:52.486]  And the great thing about a fight, folks, is once a fist starts swinging, you're not scared anymore.
[01:22:52.506 --> 01:22:57.590]  And we're not talking about a physical fight, but an information warfare fight, and let's just get it on.
[01:22:58.010 --> 01:23:05.415]  Yeah, I think that we have all, myself included, have been punished enough by the federal system that it kind of loses that fear after a certain point in time.
[01:23:05.475 --> 01:23:11.278]  When you realize that you're not fighting for yourself, but you're fighting for your children, your grandchildren, it changes your perspective.
[01:23:11.298 --> 01:23:12.199]  That grows a backbone.
[01:23:12.539 --> 01:23:15.981]  Yeah, if you don't have a spine already, that one should give it to you.
[01:23:16.701 --> 01:23:17.762]  If not, step aside.
[01:23:18.082 --> 01:23:19.203]  The rest of us will handle it.
[01:23:19.403 --> 01:23:19.843]  That's right.
[01:23:19.903 --> 01:23:21.264]  So we're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[01:23:21.304 --> 01:23:22.044]  I want to just say this.
[01:23:22.064 --> 01:23:24.265]  I want to get back to what you're going to cover next hour.
[01:23:24.285 --> 01:23:27.486]  Folks, we are in the black right now, but barely.
[01:23:27.967 --> 01:23:29.447]  I wish we had reporters at Davos.
[01:23:29.467 --> 01:23:30.528]  We didn't have the money for that.
[01:23:30.868 --> 01:23:32.548]  But Savannah Hernandez, our former reporter, is there.
[01:23:32.568 --> 01:23:33.409]  She's on with us tomorrow.
[01:23:33.869 --> 01:23:34.669]  Huge things happening.
[01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:36.910]  We exposed Davos, Bilderberg, the first steward.
[01:23:36.930 --> 01:23:37.871]  I'm not bragging.
[01:23:37.891 --> 01:23:38.291]  It's a fact.
[01:23:39.215 --> 01:23:42.738]  Your support keeping us on air in all the different outlets out there.
[01:23:42.818 --> 01:23:47.603]  We have been one of the most critical, if not the most critical, other than Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson.
[01:23:47.623 --> 01:23:49.705]  We're right there in that trifecta getting that out.
[01:23:49.745 --> 01:23:51.587]  So I'm asking you to keep me in the game.
[01:23:52.067 --> 01:23:53.709]  I'm asking you to keep us in the fight.
[01:23:53.729 --> 01:23:56.952]  I'm asking you to also get great products that will enrich your life.
[01:23:57.632 --> 01:23:59.733]  X2 is deep-earth crystal pure atomic iodine.
[01:23:59.753 --> 01:24:01.314]  There's a lot of fake atomic iodine out there.
[01:24:01.614 --> 01:24:02.915]  This is actually pharmaceutical grade.
[01:24:02.935 --> 01:24:05.337]  You've got to get a DEA license to even get it.
[01:24:05.377 --> 01:24:06.457]  It goes right into your blood.
[01:24:06.797 --> 01:24:13.201]  There's so much against all the bad halogens that they bombard us with the fluoride, the chlorine, and the bromide, and you know, all of it.
[01:24:13.762 --> 01:24:15.823]  It's still 25% off by itself.
[01:24:15.883 --> 01:24:17.344]  That sale has to end Wednesday morning.
[01:24:17.964 --> 01:24:19.504]  Because I've been too busy to even change the sale.
[01:24:19.524 --> 01:24:20.845]  It was supposed to be over this weekend.
[01:24:20.865 --> 01:24:21.645]  We're about to sell out.
[01:24:21.665 --> 01:24:23.385]  We're going to go back to full price on Wednesday.
[01:24:23.845 --> 01:24:26.606]  Ultra 12's highest quality, medical grade, vitamin B12, take it out of the tongue.
[01:24:27.046 --> 01:24:28.987]  Second best way to absorb it, the best way is injection.
[01:24:29.007 --> 01:24:29.667]  Don't inject this.
[01:24:30.027 --> 01:24:31.547]  It's the very same stuff you get from your doctor.
[01:24:32.248 --> 01:24:35.968]  And it's amazing for your stamina, your libido, but your immune system, number one.
[01:24:36.349 --> 01:24:41.570]  Forty percent off the powerful combo of Ultra 12 and X2 together.
[01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:42.370]  Forty percent off.
[01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:44.251]  Ultra 12, we've got plenty of that.
[01:24:44.631 --> 01:24:45.891]  Continue on at forty percent off.
[01:24:46.351 --> 01:24:50.354]  But X2, the sale will end in just 48 hours or less.
[01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:54.417]  InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:24:54.857 --> 01:25:00.941]  And I want to thank all the listeners and viewers that have been donating at the top of InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:25:00.961 --> 01:25:03.683]  That way we get 95% of the money after credit card fees.
[01:25:04.124 --> 01:25:08.407]  So InfoWarsTore.com or AAA253-3139.
[01:25:08.427 --> 01:25:10.228]  Dr. Fleming, Mike Adams is coming up.
[01:25:10.248 --> 01:25:11.889]  He'll co-host 30 minutes and he'll continue on.
[01:25:11.909 --> 01:25:14.191]  We're going to get into this big issue.
[01:25:15.686 --> 01:25:19.987]  Of what these so-called vaccines actually do in planning in our DNA, which is now confirmed.
[01:25:20.527 --> 01:25:22.348]  You and Mike Adams talked about two years ago.
[01:25:22.448 --> 01:25:23.588]  What else are you going to hit next hour?
[01:25:23.948 --> 01:25:28.650]  I think what we'll hit is what those vaccines actually do when you add those to human blood.
[01:25:28.710 --> 01:25:37.912]  Mike Adams and I did some of this research over at one of his locations where we actually have 60 hours worth of recorded material where the vaccines are added to human blood.
[01:25:38.373 --> 01:25:41.033]  We actually looked at what the vaccines look like under the microscope.
[01:25:41.053 --> 01:25:42.974]  We looked at what they actually do to human blood.
[01:25:43.454 --> 01:25:46.398]  And the damage that it causes to the red blood cells of the body.
[01:25:47.219 --> 01:25:49.902]  That's right, you and Mike have been, you're such scientists, you guys have been...
[01:25:50.839 --> 01:25:51.880]  Holding off on your research.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:54.741]  I know you and he told me it was dramatic what other scientists found.
[01:25:55.242 --> 01:25:58.464]  Basically accelerated coagulation versus blood that didn't have it put in it.
[01:25:58.884 --> 01:26:00.065]  When is that research going to come out?
[01:26:00.505 --> 01:26:04.608]  We've been going through the process of trying to get it out and it's amazing.
[01:26:05.048 --> 01:26:07.850]  We have had a number of journals that have said it's very interesting.
[01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:12.713]  However, if it's published, it will cause everybody to have to question the vaccines.
[01:26:14.284 --> 01:26:23.609]  The journals are supposed to publish important, critical material, but they're holding off because they're afraid it will cause everybody to question the vaccines, and it should.
[01:26:24.289 --> 01:26:31.133]  Well, you and Mike, I know a lot of trailblazers, but right up there in the top ten or so of thousands of trailblazers, I know it's you guys.
[01:26:31.293 --> 01:26:37.496]  And for my family, Dr. Fleming, and this whole crew and everybody listening, we want to thank you for your courage and your tireless work.
[01:26:37.516 --> 01:26:49.605]   I know you do it because You have children as well, and grandchildren, but I just want to commend what you're doing, and Mike Adams, because man, people talk about Alex Jones being vindicated, you guys have been massively vindicated.
[01:26:51.106 --> 01:26:54.289]  It's just a matter of what you have to do, and what you're supposed to be doing, you know?
[01:26:54.849 --> 01:26:57.231]  I have three children, I don't have any grandchildren yet.
[01:26:57.251 --> 01:26:57.851]  I was guessing you did.
[01:26:57.871 --> 01:26:59.973]  If I do, if I do, my children are in trouble.
[01:27:00.914 --> 01:27:02.254]  I was guessing you've got a 30-year-old.
[01:27:02.275 --> 01:27:04.116]  Well, we've got to get busy here.
[01:27:04.136 --> 01:27:06.197]  Alright, I don't have any yet either.
[01:27:06.217 --> 01:27:06.938]  First they have to get married.
[01:27:07.038 --> 01:27:08.038]  That's right. We'll be right back.
[01:27:08.038 --> 01:27:23.358]   I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported
[01:27:23.358 --> 01:27:26.638]   InfoWars financially with word of mouth and prayer.
[01:27:26.607 --> 01:27:33.791]  All the success that we've had together against the Globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[01:27:34.211 --> 01:27:36.433]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:27:37.173 --> 01:27:43.796]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at InfoWarsTore.com like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration and so much more.
[01:27:44.236 --> 01:27:56.681]  But for those of you that want to actually give us a straight donation so we get almost 100% of the money to fund our operation during this critical time, go to InfoWarsTore.com and right at the top you'll see a link to make a straight donation.
[01:27:56.701 --> 01:27:59.142]  A one-time donation of $5, $10, $50 or a recurring donation you can cancel any time.
[01:28:03.484 --> 01:28:04.884]  I want to thank all of you that have donated.
[01:28:04.904 --> 01:28:18.088]  I want to encourage those of you out there that want to support Freedom to take action now and be part of the global awakening, the new renaissance that's countered the Great Reset by going to InfoWarsTore.com and clicking on the donate button and giving today.
[01:28:18.448 --> 01:28:19.709]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:28:19.789 --> 01:28:20.449]  Please take action.
[01:28:22.589 --> 01:28:28.832]  If you'd asked me all this stuff a year ago about the corruption that's going on, I would have said you're crazy.
[01:28:28.892 --> 01:28:32.975]  There's no way that there could be this level of corruption in government.
[01:28:33.015 --> 01:28:38.778]  You shouldn't listen to InfoWars and Band.Video because that's all nonsense.
[01:28:38.878 --> 01:28:41.339]  And, you know, we shouldn't pay attention to any of this stuff.
[01:28:44.562 --> 01:28:54.573]  It's been very evident to me that all of these people who are being labeled as misinformation spreaders, I mean, they're the guys telling the truth.
[01:28:55.034 --> 01:29:02.803]  There are many thousands of physicians who have been silenced from telling the American people the good news about the situation, that we can manage the virus.
[01:29:03.283 --> 01:29:06.945]  The true misinformation spreaders are the CDC and the public health officials.
[01:29:07.165 --> 01:29:10.527]  This remains a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:29:10.587 --> 01:29:13.208]  They are the ones that are propagating this outbreak.
[01:29:13.228 --> 01:29:14.168]  The only people you can blame.
[01:29:14.188 --> 01:29:15.809]  This isn't shaming, this is the truth.
[01:29:15.829 --> 01:29:17.070]  Maybe they should be shamed.
[01:29:17.310 --> 01:29:18.270]  Of the unvaccinated.
[01:29:18.791 --> 01:29:23.193]  This is a situation of an outbreak and a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[01:29:23.132 --> 01:29:27.132]   Dr. Fauci's probably done more good for the world than all of us in this room combined.
[01:29:27.132 --> 01:29:32.132]  [Applause]
[01:29:32.132 --> 01:29:38.702]   Dr. Fauci, knowing that it is a crime to lie to Congress, do you wish to retract your statement of May 11th where you
[01:29:38.702 --> 01:29:43.132]   claimed that the NIH never funded gain-of-function research in Wuhan?
[01:29:43.008 --> 01:29:44.468]  I totally resent that!
[01:29:44.548 --> 01:29:48.349]  And if anybody is lying here, Senator, it is you!
[01:29:48.529 --> 01:30:01.312]  We now know that Fauci-funded EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit headed by Peter Daszak, was absolutely engaged in gain-of-function research to make chimeric SARS-based coronaviruses, which they confirmed could infect human cells.
[01:30:01.432 --> 01:30:02.152]  And the worst part?
[01:30:02.652 --> 01:30:07.096]  All the people going along and being lab rats for these heartless megacorporations.
[01:30:07.517 --> 01:30:08.838]  It is truly incredible.
[01:30:09.178 --> 01:30:14.603]  If only people had the entire story that the COVID shots are not conventional vaccines.
[01:30:15.004 --> 01:30:20.829]  There are plenty of examples of people that are having very serious medical conditions that result from the vaccination.
[01:30:20.989 --> 01:30:25.193]  When the convulsion started, I knew it had to be from the vaccine.
[01:30:25.433 --> 01:30:30.454]  Due to this vaccine, I don't even know if I'll gain full movement in my leg back.
[01:30:30.734 --> 01:30:33.095]  One of their high school football players died.
[01:30:33.115 --> 01:30:37.156]  He had two blood clots inside his brain, another on the outside of his brain.
[01:30:37.176 --> 01:30:39.496]  The hardest thing was I let him get that shot.
[01:30:39.836 --> 01:30:42.997]  They got the vaccine!
[01:30:42.856 --> 01:30:44.856]  I got the vaccine!
[01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:46.856]  [Crying]
[01:30:46.856 --> 01:30:48.856]  [Crying]
[01:30:48.856 --> 01:30:50.856]  Please help!
[01:30:50.856 --> 01:30:52.856]  We need help!
[01:30:52.856 --> 01:31:02.856]  [Music]
[01:31:02.856 --> 01:31:04.856]  [Music]
[01:31:04.856 --> 01:31:08.856]  Thanks to you kids, we now know the virus is a hoax!
[01:31:09.234 --> 01:31:13.659]  They included flu, pneumonia, and other infections to boost the numbers.
[01:31:13.679 --> 01:31:15.300]  Let's find out who is really behind it all.
[01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:18.864]  Like, President Trump is definitely behind one of these phantoms.
[01:31:22.107 --> 01:31:23.188]  Gigi Ping?
[01:31:24.669 --> 01:31:25.750]  Dr. Fauci?
[01:31:25.810 --> 01:31:29.194]  Like, I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not scare them.
[01:31:30.686 --> 01:31:32.387]  Microsoft's Bill Gates?
[01:31:32.547 --> 01:31:38.652]  Not only a computer guy, he's a notorious vaccine pusher who wants to reduce the world's population.
[01:31:39.012 --> 01:31:39.593]  I get it.
[01:31:39.653 --> 01:31:45.017]  So Bill Gates wanted to vaccinate everyone after Fauci convinced them there was a deadly disease outbreak.
[01:31:45.057 --> 01:31:46.078]  That's diabolical.
[01:31:46.098 --> 01:31:47.959]  Yeah, that sounds pretty bad.
[01:31:48.059 --> 01:31:49.060]  Don't worry, kids.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:52.682]  These globalists won't get away with their pandemic hoax this time.
[01:31:52.843 --> 01:31:57.086]  Where they're going, they'll be locked up for a long good while in the big house.
[01:31:57.566 --> 01:31:58.006]  Yeah!
[01:31:58.206 --> 01:32:01.207]  Better than a rock round at home!
[01:32:05.549 --> 01:32:07.070]  We are drugged out!
[01:32:07.630 --> 01:32:09.911]  We are following other people's opinions!
[01:32:11.079 --> 01:32:13.300]  We are controlled by the media.
[01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:15.420]  Today it all changes.
[01:32:15.721 --> 01:32:18.221]  This reality has been forced upon us.
[01:32:18.481 --> 01:32:19.242]  It is a choice.
[01:32:19.522 --> 01:32:21.322]  Just like when I said slavery is a choice.
[01:32:21.562 --> 01:32:26.144]  Einstein said the death of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result.
[01:32:26.284 --> 01:32:29.165]  So we keep on saying I hate you, I hate you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[01:32:29.425 --> 01:32:31.505]  How are we going to get a different result out of hate?
[01:32:31.625 --> 01:32:33.746]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:32:34.206 --> 01:32:35.647]  Why don't we just try love?
[01:32:35.907 --> 01:32:43.902]   We have the You need some crazy motherfuckers to change something.
[01:32:43.922 --> 01:32:45.223]  Steve Jobs is crazy.
[01:32:45.423 --> 01:32:47.005]  Now we all on Steve Jobs' phones.
[01:32:47.045 --> 01:32:47.905]  They say Trump's crazy.
[01:32:48.105 --> 01:32:49.006]  They say I'm crazy.
[01:32:49.186 --> 01:32:51.408]  But I'm here to show love.
[01:32:51.588 --> 01:32:54.710]  It's a bigger plan, and I'm just doing what the universe told me.
[01:32:56.648 --> 01:33:00.290]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:02.670]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:02.891 --> 01:33:07.352]  All right, Mike Adams of Natural News with Dr. Richard Fleming straight ahead.
[01:33:07.372 --> 01:33:08.953]  We're gonna play clips of two years ago.
[01:33:08.973 --> 01:33:14.275]  Myself and Mike Adams predicting everything that's now happened, including monkeypox straight ahead.
[01:33:14.335 --> 01:33:14.835]  Stay with us.
[01:33:14.855 --> 01:33:15.816]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[01:33:20.185 --> 01:33:23.407]  Addictive programming from 15 years ago.
[01:33:23.507 --> 01:33:26.970]  Here's the Simpsons on what's happening now with monkeypox.
[01:33:31.093 --> 01:33:34.716]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[01:33:35.196 --> 01:33:43.282]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong in dark rooms glued to their televisions too terrified to skip the commercials.
[01:33:43.702 --> 01:33:47.225]  Well, I think NBC you are here to listen and not speak.
[01:33:48.681 --> 01:33:50.581]  I think we should go with a good old-fashioned public health care.
[01:33:50.841 --> 01:33:52.342]  Yeah.
[01:33:52.402 --> 01:33:53.042]  A new disease.
[01:33:53.302 --> 01:33:53.922]  No one's immune.
[01:33:54.242 --> 01:33:57.503]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic.
[01:33:57.683 --> 01:33:59.383]  And instead of summer, it's all the time.
[01:33:59.603 --> 01:34:04.284]  Now, I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[01:34:04.304 --> 01:34:05.844]  He loves being that guy.
[01:34:05.944 --> 01:34:08.384]  But, Janice, we do have standards.
[01:34:08.584 --> 01:34:10.305]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[01:34:10.565 --> 01:34:14.865]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[01:34:15.065 --> 01:34:18.166]  We do have something we've been holding onto, but it hasn't been tested.
[01:34:18.828 --> 01:34:19.571]  Get over here, NBC.
[01:34:21.917 --> 01:34:25.220]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I... Oh!
[01:34:27.782 --> 01:34:28.062]  Wow!
[01:34:28.742 --> 01:34:29.043]  Wow!
[01:34:29.543 --> 01:34:30.083]  Oh yeah!
[01:34:30.163 --> 01:34:31.945]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[01:34:32.365 --> 01:34:36.608]  Now, we just have to blame it on something that's in every household.
[01:34:36.809 --> 01:34:39.190]  Something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:41.913]  House Cat Flu is coming, people!
[01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:49.478]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the House Cat Flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[01:34:51.048 --> 01:34:57.048]   So petter beware, that warm body on your lap just might be ready to destroy your tender fiddles.
[01:34:57.048 --> 01:35:07.637]   Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information if they experience any of the following
[01:35:07.637 --> 01:35:08.048]  symptoms.
[01:35:08.243 --> 01:35:11.226]  Mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night.
[01:35:13.868 --> 01:35:15.350]  Explode into space!
[01:35:16.545 --> 01:35:17.966]  All right, it's an 18-minute compilation.
[01:35:18.006 --> 01:35:18.927]  It's a banned-out video.
[01:35:18.967 --> 01:35:26.933]  Half of it's Mike Adams and myself, two-plus years ago, producing everything that has now unfolded with the monkeypox, the forced inoculations, and the next pandemic.
[01:35:27.012 --> 01:35:47.813]  Here it is.
[01:35:47.813 --> 01:35:57.813]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[01:35:49.332 --> 01:35:57.475]  During the larger depopulation events that happen, and then the deep state globally pretending it's the savior, while it's actually organizing the operation.
[01:35:57.715 --> 01:36:05.978]  And there are also binary weapons that we talked about yesterday, just a little bit, as this virus combines with what they're putting into the vaccine.
[01:36:06.018 --> 01:36:14.921]  Remember, they can put DNA-altering ingredients into the vaccines, and isn't it amazing they have the vaccine ready for this at the same time the outbreak happened?
[01:36:14.941 --> 01:36:17.382]  Yep, and they're going to roll out mandatory vaccines.
[01:36:17.742 --> 01:36:29.533]  When this becomes a panic in America, and by the way, the media is going to cause this to be a massive, massive, you know, panic among the public, but they're going to push people to mandatory vaccines.
[01:36:29.553 --> 01:36:30.915]  They're going to have an emergency order.
[01:36:31.313 --> 01:36:37.032]   Maybe by the president. I don't know. I don't know if he's gonna stop this. He's not stopping the tech censorship
[01:36:37.032 --> 01:36:41.481]   I don't know what he's gonna do But they're gonna have mandatory vaccines and the vaccines
[01:36:41.481 --> 01:36:46.752]   will be the second half of the binary weapon. This is euthanasia
[01:36:46.752 --> 01:36:52.632]   Via vaccination. I don't believe this is the big one. They need to have a virus
[01:36:52.632 --> 01:36:56.192]   It's deadly but not ultra deadly to get everybody under world government
[01:36:56.192 --> 01:37:01.953]   Everybody used to being forcibly inoculated in quarantines and shutdowns and these systems of
[01:37:01.953 --> 01:37:16.139]   total control The globalists are testing right now our response to see if they can lock us down, and then if we lock down properly, then they're going to release the real bio version that'll then start wiping out even more.
[01:37:16.339 --> 01:37:19.022]  So this is a test for the global depopulation operation.
[01:37:19.986 --> 01:37:24.289]  It's 2020 and they're gearing up to exterminate you and your family.
[01:37:24.910 --> 01:37:26.651]  It came out of Wuhan.
[01:37:27.552 --> 01:37:30.094]  China incubated this and then deployed it worldwide.
[01:37:30.654 --> 01:37:31.355]  Well, absolutely.
[01:37:31.415 --> 01:37:32.136]  And they're not done.
[01:37:32.316 --> 01:37:33.637]  This is just the first wave.
[01:37:33.677 --> 01:37:35.638]  So you you hinted at this earlier.
[01:37:35.658 --> 01:37:37.940]  This is a softening up phase for America.
[01:37:38.381 --> 01:37:41.503]  There is a much more virulent strain that will be released.
[01:37:41.563 --> 01:37:43.485]  And it's an opening salvo of a larger role.
[01:37:43.545 --> 01:37:47.147]  And it really all crystallized for me doing deep research last night, this morning and talking to you.
[01:37:47.207 --> 01:37:50.595]   And I think you just picked up where I was Well, there's 18 minutes of it.
[01:37:50.655 --> 01:37:52.777]  Alex Jones predicts the monkeypox outbreak with Mike Adams.
[01:37:53.157 --> 01:37:59.283]  We're riding shotgun here with Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com and Dr. Richard Fleming of TheFlemingMethod.com, medical doctor.
[01:37:59.643 --> 01:38:00.764]  You guys have worked closely together.
[01:38:00.825 --> 01:38:05.269]  Big research about to come out soon on what the vaccine does, so-called vaccine of the blood.
[01:38:05.729 --> 01:38:07.751]  Mike Adams, what an incredible time.
[01:38:08.231 --> 01:38:11.214]  I could ask a thousand questions, but where do you want to begin, my friend?
[01:38:11.254 --> 01:38:13.837]  Because people say Alex Jones, tomorrow's news today.
[01:38:13.997 --> 01:38:18.546]   Mike Adams, and Dr. Richard Fleming are tomorrow's news today, and that's who we want on this show.
[01:38:18.886 --> 01:38:19.809]  So God bless you, brother.
[01:38:20.069 --> 01:38:21.493]  You've already told us what was going to happen.
[01:38:21.753 --> 01:38:22.776]  Tell us what's going to happen next.
[01:38:24.545 --> 01:38:31.650]  Well, first I just want to say I've been listening to Dr. Fleming, just an extraordinary analysis, and he's nailing it, as usual.
[01:38:32.391 --> 01:38:33.511]  So thank you for having me on.
[01:38:33.572 --> 01:38:44.119]  But the big, big picture is, of course, vaccines and these pandemics are just one part of a multi-part takedown, what I call a controlled demolition of Western civilization.
[01:38:44.539 --> 01:38:53.025]  And the other three big parts that are being launched against us are a food collapse, an energy collapse, and then a currency collapse.
[01:38:53.746 --> 01:39:00.289]  And while we can take steps individually to survive many of these things, for example, we can choose to avoid the vaccines.
[01:39:00.749 --> 01:39:03.991]  We can prepare with extra food to help avoid a food collapse.
[01:39:04.751 --> 01:39:11.594]  We can even perhaps have some alternative forms of money, either crypto or gold and silver or whatever you have.
[01:39:12.034 --> 01:39:18.777]  But when the energy collapse takes down the power grid, that's when even preppers are going to have a very difficult time.
[01:39:18.797 --> 01:39:19.158]  That's right.
[01:39:19.198 --> 01:39:21.699]  And I played clips of you two years ago predicting the viruses.
[01:39:22.379 --> 01:39:31.372]  You and all of us, you predicted the power blackouts, the food collapse, the fertilizer collapse, and you're right, that's part of the other pronged attacks.
[01:39:32.719 --> 01:39:41.064]  And then coming out of these vaccines, and I know Dr. Fleming can speak to this more, but the genetic mutations are already beginning in people's bodies.
[01:39:41.444 --> 01:39:49.349]  The birth mutations that are going to happen, the birth defects that we're going to see, the spontaneous abortions have already begun.
[01:39:49.770 --> 01:39:58.115]  We're going to see, I believe, at least a decade of effects from these vaccines, which will include more deaths, more genetic mutations, more blood clots.
[01:39:58.995 --> 01:40:01.477]  I mean, look, why are the airlines running out of pilots right now?
[01:40:01.997 --> 01:40:04.738]  Answer, because they killed so many of them with the vaccines.
[01:40:05.118 --> 01:40:05.818]  So what are they doing?
[01:40:05.858 --> 01:40:09.018]  They're reducing the number of hours now required to become a pilot.
[01:40:09.458 --> 01:40:10.399]  This is insane!
[01:40:10.419 --> 01:40:19.100]  You're going to have pilots now that don't have the training to be a pilot flying airplanes that are probably also assembled and put together by teams that don't have qualifications either.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:23.881]  We're watching the dismantling of Western civilization in lots of different ways.
[01:40:23.921 --> 01:40:26.721]  But go ahead, I'm sure Dr. Fleming would like to add.
[01:40:26.741 --> 01:40:27.242]  No, and that's it.
[01:40:27.282 --> 01:40:29.222]  This is the destruction of the human brain trust.
[01:40:29.762 --> 01:40:37.547]  Right, and I would say the same thing happened with NASA after the Apollo program between the time that Apollo actually launched and the shuttles went off.
[01:40:37.627 --> 01:40:48.255]  I mean, we saw the newer kids coming in to take control, and they laid off the more experienced physicists and engineers, and they started gluing tiles on the bottom of the shuttle.
[01:40:49.035 --> 01:40:50.136]  Let's not lie.
[01:40:50.476 --> 01:40:52.037]  People used to be smarter.
[01:40:52.538 --> 01:40:54.439]  We're like the best of our generation.
[01:40:54.519 --> 01:40:56.360]  We're idiots compared to people 100 years ago.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:57.021]  What happened?
[01:40:59.028 --> 01:41:00.148]  We've dumbed down a lot of things.
[01:41:00.208 --> 01:41:08.514]  I mean, I had a great advantage being in my role as a JFK kid, but I frequently look at the people that are coming through the system right now.
[01:41:08.574 --> 01:41:09.975]  They're not very well educated.
[01:41:10.015 --> 01:41:11.215]  They don't have math down.
[01:41:11.255 --> 01:41:12.776]  They don't even have handwriting down.
[01:41:13.217 --> 01:41:29.551]   We're focusing on educating people on things that I think more of the parents' responsibility to educate, and the primary school system isn't educating people in the math and the sciences and history and the things that it's supposed to be the responsibility of the school system to educate them for.
[01:41:29.591 --> 01:41:37.339]  It's not the school system's responsibility to raise our children, either religious-wise or anything else-wise.
[01:41:37.379 --> 01:41:41.103]  The school's supposed to give the curriculum you choose, the parents are supposed to make sure it happens.
[01:41:41.463 --> 01:41:45.125]  Right, and that has not been happening and it's been drifting further and further away.
[01:41:45.145 --> 01:41:57.130]  I mean, speaking as someone who's taught at universities, you know, what I see coming in as my beginning material, if you will, to teach medicine or physics or anything else is less and less prepared.
[01:41:57.651 --> 01:42:06.515]  I feel like I'm babysitting people and teaching junior high school in some instances, and that may sound harsh, but the reality is it's not my job to be teaching junior high.
[01:42:06.535 --> 01:42:08.676]  If I wanted to do that, I'd be a junior high school teacher.
[01:42:08.996 --> 01:42:12.005]  So, Mike, what you've been hammering for years, we're facing the collapse of civilization.
[01:42:12.447 --> 01:42:13.691]  I don't think you're going to be stopped now.
[01:42:13.731 --> 01:42:15.837]  We should just decide how do we protect ourselves.
[01:42:16.570 --> 01:42:27.133]  No, I don't think it can be stopped either, and one of the key markers of intelligence is the ability to look into the future and calculate the future ramifications of present actions.
[01:42:27.593 --> 01:42:29.633]  But that has been lost across our culture.
[01:42:29.653 --> 01:42:31.534]  So our leaders, and also Western Europe.
[01:42:31.894 --> 01:42:35.775]  Western European leaders of Germany and other countries are making the dumbest decisions possible.
[01:42:36.275 --> 01:42:38.795]  Western Europe is in a stage of collapse.
[01:42:38.835 --> 01:42:43.737]  It's accelerating, and if Western civilization survives the next decade, I will be shocked.
[01:42:43.917 --> 01:42:44.497]  It's that bad.
[01:42:45.723 --> 01:42:48.384]  It really is so horrible you can't even quantify it.
[01:42:48.424 --> 01:42:51.445]  I mean it's hard to even try to, I mean it's bad.
[01:42:51.685 --> 01:42:53.906]  So at least we're trying to fix the problem folks.
[01:42:54.226 --> 01:42:56.206]  We're right back with Mike Adams and Dr. Richard Fleming.
[01:42:56.526 --> 01:42:57.487]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:42:57.887 --> 01:43:01.088]  Infowars.com, FlemingMethod.com, NaturalNews.com.
[01:43:01.948 --> 01:43:03.028]  Welcome my friends.
[01:43:04.989 --> 01:43:07.510]  Welcome to the revolution.
[01:43:09.142 --> 01:43:12.985]  Dr. Fleming riding shotgun with us, Mike Adams of naturalnews.com with us this hour.
[01:43:13.685 --> 01:43:24.912]  Mike, you got right into the other prongs of the attack, full spectrum analysis of what we need, but specifically the monkey pox, the fear-mongering, the delivery of the vaccine beforehand, all of it.
[01:43:24.932 --> 01:43:26.113]  Give us your analysis of that.
[01:43:27.421 --> 01:43:29.302]  Well, frankly, I'll just be blunt.
[01:43:29.322 --> 01:43:38.868]  I mean, anybody dumb enough to now go along with the monkeypox hysteria after the two years of COVID and everything that came out, anybody that dumb is dumber than a monkey, frankly.
[01:43:38.968 --> 01:43:46.972]  I mean, really, you know, the primates in the zoos have more intelligence because you can't fool them so many times over and over and over.
[01:43:47.012 --> 01:43:50.374]  Like the gorilla catches on, you know, you're messing with me.
[01:43:50.394 --> 01:43:51.555]  I'm not going to fall for it again.
[01:43:51.575 --> 01:43:54.337]  But humans just keep falling for it again and again.
[01:43:55.450 --> 01:43:56.171]  It's just incredible.
[01:43:56.191 --> 01:43:59.873]  I mean, you know, Dr. Fleming laid it out, but this whole thing was planned.
[01:43:59.913 --> 01:44:03.255]  They've got patents involving monkeypox and vaccines.
[01:44:04.216 --> 01:44:05.457]  They did simulations.
[01:44:05.837 --> 01:44:07.878]  It even came out on the exact day.
[01:44:08.359 --> 01:44:10.960]  And it's a mild concern anyway.
[01:44:11.361 --> 01:44:14.403]  It's just one more panic that people need to learn to put away.
[01:44:14.443 --> 01:44:18.425]  I mean, journo-terrorism is the scourge against humanity right now.
[01:44:18.925 --> 01:44:23.068]  The so-called corporate media is running psychological operations constantly.
[01:44:23.088 --> 01:44:23.989]  This is just the latest one.
[01:44:24.815 --> 01:44:25.856]  America's captured.
[01:44:25.896 --> 01:44:27.939]  America's both the hope and the curse of the world.
[01:44:28.679 --> 01:44:35.086]  And with 169 days out from the election, they are hyping terror attacks, white supremacy, all of this.
[01:44:35.547 --> 01:44:37.229]  Will they do 2,000 mules again?
[01:44:38.010 --> 01:44:43.656]  How are they going to deal with a giant worldwide political awakening, Mike Adams and Dr. Fleming, to what's happening?
[01:44:44.861 --> 01:44:54.465]  Well, first, they're going to be dealing with the food riots that are happening, I mean, going to happen worldwide because, you know, we've talked about on your show, Alex, the food scarcity is real.
[01:44:54.765 --> 01:44:55.285]  It is accelerating.
[01:44:55.305 --> 01:44:56.165]  Well, it's not going to happen.
[01:44:56.205 --> 01:44:58.566]  You were arping on this two years ago, and I thought you went too far.
[01:44:59.066 --> 01:45:00.867]  But I listened to you, so I was right.
[01:45:01.407 --> 01:45:02.768]  Sri Lanka, all over the place.
[01:45:02.828 --> 01:45:03.428]  It's already begun.
[01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:10.515]  And wait till the crop harvest reports start coming in in the USDA here in the next 60 days.
[01:45:10.916 --> 01:45:12.117]  It's going to be catastrophic.
[01:45:12.397 --> 01:45:13.658]  The fertilizer shortage is real.
[01:45:13.718 --> 01:45:15.380]  Food scarcity is real.
[01:45:16.061 --> 01:45:22.447]  We're going to see food passports launched, I believe, in 2023 in the United States where you will have rationing.
[01:45:22.907 --> 01:45:24.288]  And then there will be price controls.
[01:45:24.328 --> 01:45:32.554]  We've already seen the House pass a bill about gasoline anti-price gouging, which is really a price control mechanism.
[01:45:32.914 --> 01:45:43.601]  So the minute they put out price controls, the gasoline and diesel supply is going to vanish from many gas stations, because who's going to sell these things at a loss if the government's controlling their price?
[01:45:43.641 --> 01:45:45.463]  I mean, price controls are always disastrous.
[01:45:45.483 --> 01:45:46.764]  It's the opposite of free market.
[01:45:46.784 --> 01:45:51.407]  And for those that don't know, because people won't have the money to extract it, refine it, and deliver it.
[01:45:52.779 --> 01:45:56.302]  Well, right, and the infrastructure is breaking down, but again, it's all deliberate.
[01:45:56.763 --> 01:46:02.348]  Look at what Biden did on his first day after the election was stolen and he was thrust into the fake Oval Office.
[01:46:02.828 --> 01:46:06.812]  He signed a bunch of executive orders, by the way, which are null and void, we know now.
[01:46:08.234 --> 01:46:13.839]   Maybe at one point, Everything that Biden signed will be evacuated and sanity can be restored.
[01:46:14.159 --> 01:46:18.363]  But it's all null and void, but he shut down all the pipelines and the drilling permits.
[01:46:18.764 --> 01:46:24.289]  And I'm sure you saw his new clip where he said it's part of a plan to make us go to clean energy when there is no plan.
[01:46:24.509 --> 01:46:29.014]  I mean, it's one thing to have the head of the Department of Energy say it, but he said it yesterday.
[01:46:30.063 --> 01:46:34.567]  Well, remember, Alex, the zero carbon agenda requires zero population.
[01:46:34.967 --> 01:46:35.327]  Period.
[01:46:35.608 --> 01:46:35.988]  That's it.
[01:46:36.048 --> 01:46:42.493]  That's how they're going to transition, is to kill off billions of people without giving you an alternative infrastructure.
[01:46:42.553 --> 01:46:48.839]  And one more thing is that they've been suppressing free energy technology for decades.
[01:46:49.099 --> 01:46:49.800]  And you know this.
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:52.322]  Low energy... They call it disruptive technology.
[01:46:52.682 --> 01:46:53.663]  Disruptive technology.
[01:46:54.564 --> 01:46:55.684]  We have green tech.
[01:46:55.725 --> 01:46:55.985]  Go ahead.
[01:46:56.565 --> 01:47:03.549]  You can't get to clean technology if you don't have a bridge between where you are and where you want to go.
[01:47:03.589 --> 01:47:07.811]  And if you pull that bridge out, you don't have a mechanism for getting there.
[01:47:08.051 --> 01:47:08.411]  Exactly.
[01:47:08.431 --> 01:47:09.492]  This is not a transition.
[01:47:09.872 --> 01:47:10.032]  Right.
[01:47:10.693 --> 01:47:11.453]  This is a collapse.
[01:47:11.713 --> 01:47:21.242]  I mean, you can go to, I hate to do this, Star Trek episodes where they actually had the sun blocked out so they couldn't get any solar power on the planet, and what happened?
[01:47:21.642 --> 01:47:22.623]  Nothing ran.
[01:47:23.023 --> 01:47:30.130]  You have to have backup mechanisms, and those backup mechanisms, like it or not, have to do with fossil fuels at this point in time.
[01:47:30.230 --> 01:47:35.334]  You pull those fossil fuels out, you have no backup mechanism to deal with an emergency.
[01:47:35.874 --> 01:47:47.943]  If we go back to what really happened with this virus and they kept the ships off the shore, they stopped and they blocked the transport of goods coming into the country, beginning the process of shortages.
[01:47:48.743 --> 01:47:57.365]  And what they just did with the formula was to attack the most vulnerable part, other than the elderly, but very vulnerable people.
[01:47:57.565 --> 01:48:00.785]  Parents worried about feeding their children.
[01:48:00.945 --> 01:48:05.646]  And that's when you know that they're going for the jugular on people, when they go for that type of thing.
[01:48:05.706 --> 01:48:13.628]  And the question is, if you're that desperate to try to manipulate the system, it shows just how desperate you can be and what you're willing to do.
[01:48:14.208 --> 01:48:19.711]  And by the way, Bill Gates had a plan rejected by the UN to try to put out satellites and block the sun.
[01:48:20.432 --> 01:48:23.753]  Well, Bill Gates right now can't even go to the country of India, can he?
[01:48:23.813 --> 01:48:26.635]  Because they've got, I think there's three charges for murdering him.
[01:48:26.675 --> 01:48:32.298]  So you see how effectively it can be if we get attorney generals and people involved to indict these people.
[01:48:32.338 --> 01:48:34.539]  Their little game plan gets run amuck.
[01:48:34.559 --> 01:48:34.959]  That's right.
[01:48:34.999 --> 01:48:38.061]  Mike Adams-Fleming's got the plan, and I agree, it's the way to go.
[01:48:38.461 --> 01:48:40.422]  Gain of function, state attorney generals.
[01:48:41.303 --> 01:48:42.123]  What's your view on that?
[01:48:42.163 --> 01:48:43.064]  How do we stop these people?
[01:48:43.908 --> 01:48:44.768]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:44.788 --> 01:48:51.491]  What Dr. Fleming is doing brilliantly, by the way, is gathering the evidence of the criminal misconduct that has been taking place.
[01:48:51.531 --> 01:49:08.698]  It's not just scientific fraud, which many others have pointed to, like Steve Kirsch, for example, but criminal liability is going to happen because with the criminal evidence, you can pierce the veil of legal immunity that's been granted under the Emergency Use Authorization granted by the FDA.
[01:49:09.079 --> 01:49:23.823]   So these are Criminal operations that have been waged against humanity that are on the scale that are historic and think about the bioweapons laboratories in Eastern Ukraine Okay, and the monkeypox ties to that now We know why the u.s.
[01:49:23.883 --> 01:49:43.914]   Is so desperate to keep sending more money to Ukraine to try to stop the discovery of the evidence in those bioweapons laboratories from coming out once that comes out If it comes out, the whole world will know that it was the West and the United States and the UK that was in on building biological weapons to attack the human race.
[01:49:44.975 --> 01:49:49.139]  Both of you guys, 45 seconds apiece, you made incredible predictions that came true.
[01:49:49.159 --> 01:49:51.181]  Dr. Fleming, what's your next prediction?
[01:49:52.304 --> 01:49:58.506]  My next prediction is that they're going to try whatever they can do to cause mass chaos, but my prediction is for the American people.
[01:49:59.027 --> 01:50:02.748]  We're going to go, we're going to get attorney generals to file indictments on these people.
[01:50:03.108 --> 01:50:07.970]  It's going to start unraveling this and people are going to have to come to terms with what the corruption has been.
[01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:15.333]  Because history has taught us these people always fail when good people stand up and insist upon the truth being done.
[01:50:15.873 --> 01:50:20.295]  I believe they will do whatever they can to try to run us aside and make us afraid.
[01:50:21.395 --> 01:50:25.519]  These documents show it, but the American people are the light of the world.
[01:50:25.679 --> 01:50:26.699]  We can come forward.
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:28.661]  We can push for these attorney generals.
[01:50:28.741 --> 01:50:32.264]  We will get this done, and I'm not going to quit until we get them.
[01:50:32.804 --> 01:50:35.106]  So your prediction is humanity is going on the offense.
[01:50:35.146 --> 01:50:35.647]  Mike Adams.
[01:50:35.907 --> 01:50:37.748]  Yes, nobody's ever won on defense.
[01:50:37.788 --> 01:50:39.650]  Sorry, you only win on offense.
[01:50:39.690 --> 01:50:40.330]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:50:40.411 --> 01:50:43.153]  No, I agree with that assessment.
[01:50:44.494 --> 01:50:52.000]  Through a lot of pain and suffering, food scarcity, fuel scarcity, we're going to lose a couple of billion people probably on this planet over the next few years.
[01:50:52.040 --> 01:50:55.183]  But in that process, humanity will awaken like never before.
[01:50:55.503 --> 01:51:02.589]  We will dismantle the system of globalist control, the global fascists, the global Nazis, if you will, that are trying to destroy humanity.
[01:51:03.009 --> 01:51:15.480]   And humanity will prevail, and we will live in an era, a golden age of abundance and ingenuity, and unleash the science, the real science, the potential, the free energy, the healing, all of it, We will live in that golden era.
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:15.980]  It's coming.
[01:51:16.641 --> 01:51:18.202]  I totally agree with you.
[01:51:18.263 --> 01:51:19.544]  This is our greatest moment.
[01:51:20.024 --> 01:51:24.989]  Evil learned how to create a system of cloaking itself, but now it's being uncloaked.
[01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.750]  It's incredible.
[01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:26.631]  Stay with us.
[01:51:26.671 --> 01:51:27.411]  More straight ahead.
[01:51:28.452 --> 01:51:36.000]  And Mike Adams and Dr. Richard Fleming of FlemingMethod.com and NationalNews.com as well as Infowars.com.
[01:51:37.472 --> 01:51:45.858]  So the fact that natural news exists, the fact that Dr. Fleming exists, the fact that we exist makes the system so angry.
[01:51:46.458 --> 01:51:52.843]  Evil always miscalculates while humanity is asleep and believes it's invincible, believes it's unstoppable, gentlemen.
[01:51:53.684 --> 01:51:59.048]  And so I could bring up a thousand topics right now, but Mike Adams, what else is front and center for you?
[01:51:59.068 --> 01:52:00.729]  And we'll get Dr. Fleming's response.
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:07.264]  Well, let's talk about the possibility that the midterm elections will not be held.
[01:52:07.324 --> 01:52:19.214]  I know you've spoken about this quite a lot, Alex, and we know that the Democrats are absolutely desperate, and I believe that they would rather see America completely destroyed than for them to lose in this upcoming election.
[01:52:19.774 --> 01:52:25.253]   So the things that they're willing to do, kind of their possibilities of false flag
[01:52:25.253 --> 01:52:31.434]   operations, inviting China to invade the United States, setting off nuclear terrorism bombs
[01:52:31.434 --> 01:52:36.694]   or even dirty bombs of domestic terrorism actually plotted by the FBI, for example.
[01:52:36.694 --> 01:52:41.253]   These are the things that are within the Overton window of what the left is willing to do.
[01:52:41.253 --> 01:52:48.094]   If we make it to election day, we should literally cry out to Jesus Christ and thank God because
[01:52:48.094 --> 01:52:52.414]  We overcame a myth by the Democrats to try to stop us.
[01:52:51.993 --> 01:52:58.000]  They want us in a military emergency martial law scenario before the first week of November.
[01:52:58.701 --> 01:53:01.404]  I'm curious what Dr. Fleming thinks about that as well.
[01:53:02.082 --> 01:53:12.177]  Well, I think the best way to prevent that is to make sure that our senators, our elected officials, go up front and tell them not to implement anything going on with this nonsense with the World Health Organization.
[01:53:12.697 --> 01:53:15.682]  Because that is the perfect tool for them to use to lock us down.
[01:53:15.702 --> 01:53:16.703]  They're very specific.
[01:53:17.304 --> 01:53:27.368]  That civilized countries like the United States that are financially independent and want proof that there's a problem before it imposes sanctions on its citizens.
[01:53:27.868 --> 01:53:28.729]  They don't want that.
[01:53:28.829 --> 01:53:33.791]  They want every country to go into lockstep, which allows them to manipulate the United States.
[01:53:34.211 --> 01:53:36.072]  It allows them to put us in lockdown.
[01:53:36.832 --> 01:53:45.258]  It allows them to force vaccinate us, even though the Supreme Court has said in Cruzan versus Missouri that American citizens cannot be forced to take a treatment.
[01:53:45.919 --> 01:53:51.103]  The law of the land is that you can't do that, but they will do anything they can to try to manipulate that.
[01:53:51.623 --> 01:54:06.532]   If we prevent them from manipulating us by insisting that our government stand up, our elected officials stand up and do what the Constitution demands of them, and our state constitutions demand, We stand an outstanding chance of making it through the midterm
[01:54:06.532 --> 01:54:12.931]   elections and it's our obligation to make sure that happens for our children and our grandchildren.
[01:54:12.931 --> 01:54:16.931]   And Dr. Fleming, a lot of people I've talked to and asked you this and Mike Adams say,
[01:54:16.931 --> 01:54:22.931]   "Hey, they're evil, be detached from it like you're a Hindu or a Buddhist and just defeat them."
[01:54:22.761 --> 01:54:31.046]  But I think it's important like a general to know why Bill Gates, why the globalists want to depopulate, why they hate everybody, why they're doing this.
[01:54:31.546 --> 01:54:34.368]  I mean, I really think it's important to know the enemy to defeat them.
[01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:47.106]  Yeah, if you don't know your enemy, if you don't understand, I mean, the art of war, the Chinese book, Art of War, is based upon understanding what's going on and to not actually have a war until you have successfully won it.
[01:54:47.626 --> 01:54:48.907]  So why do they want to kill us?
[01:54:48.967 --> 01:54:51.348]  Why would they do this gamble?
[01:54:51.388 --> 01:54:52.649]  They're just psychos that love to kill?
[01:54:53.229 --> 01:54:59.471]  Well, I can never speak to the intent of another human being, but you watch the behaviors of the human being and you see what they're doing.
[01:54:59.551 --> 01:55:04.352]  I think that they are of the mindset that they have a better perspective of what a human being ought to be.
[01:55:04.872 --> 01:55:14.134]  They know that there is the genetic ability to modify people and they are determined that they are the new, for lack of a better word, the new gods.
[01:55:14.934 --> 01:55:15.434]  No, that's it.
[01:55:15.454 --> 01:55:16.235]  They're playing God.
[01:55:16.255 --> 01:55:18.875]  They're saying somebody else will do it if we don't do it.
[01:55:19.255 --> 01:55:20.756]  So there's a gold rush to play God.
[01:55:22.583 --> 01:55:24.144]  Yeah, I think they're fascinated with it.
[01:55:24.725 --> 01:55:30.449]  I think they're obsessed with the idea that they can take and somehow make a new human, and they're going to be in charge of it.
[01:55:30.489 --> 01:55:34.492]  And if they're in charge of it, well, they pretty much will run everything, you know?
[01:55:35.332 --> 01:55:35.733]  That's it.
[01:55:35.833 --> 01:55:36.313]  Mike Adams?
[01:55:37.354 --> 01:55:38.815]  Well, I want to bring this in.
[01:55:38.875 --> 01:55:44.879]  Remember the cobalt magnet nuclear terrorism drills that were taking place in Austin, I believe, just last week?
[01:55:46.378 --> 01:55:55.923]  And I have reliable intel that there are radical Islamic terrorists who are being brought into the United States in order to carry out dirty bomb attacks in multiple U.S.
[01:55:55.963 --> 01:55:56.263]  cities.
[01:55:56.803 --> 01:56:00.565]  Cobalt-60, and Dr. Fleming is a nuclear cardiologist.
[01:56:00.865 --> 01:56:01.906]  He knows this very, very well.
[01:56:02.406 --> 01:56:08.049]  Cobalt-60, that radioisotope is used in medical sterilization, and I think also some medical imaging.
[01:56:08.489 --> 01:56:11.350]  It has a half-life of, I think, 5.27 years.
[01:56:11.370 --> 01:56:14.612]  That's what he used to jacket dirty bombs in nuclear war.
[01:56:15.352 --> 01:56:23.059]  Well, you can use lots of radioisotopes, but the shorter the half-life, the more intense the radiation release for that particular isotope.
[01:56:23.219 --> 01:56:29.294]   But my point, I'll turn it over to you, Dr. Fleming, is that they can, because it takes 10 half-lives, Well, absolutely.
[01:56:29.314 --> 01:56:32.175]  I mean, we saw that when the Japanese reactors shut down several years ago.
[01:56:31.994 --> 01:56:36.234]   a dirty bomb in a city like Austin, Texas and they can contaminate it for about 53 years
[01:56:36.234 --> 01:56:38.394]  where it would not be safe to be habitable.
[01:56:38.394 --> 01:56:39.954]  Dr. Fleming, your take on that.
[01:56:39.954 --> 01:56:40.954]  Well, absolutely.
[01:56:40.954 --> 01:56:44.394]   I mean, we saw that when the Japanese reactor shut down several years ago.
[01:56:44.394 --> 01:56:49.755]   The exposure of people to a high level of radiation causes a lot of health concerns.
[01:56:49.755 --> 01:56:57.394]   I mean, anemias, gastrointestinal disorders, any type of tissue damage that can happen.
[01:56:57.687 --> 01:57:01.930]  And you take a population of people and you start affecting their health, you make it impossible.
[01:57:01.970 --> 01:57:02.830]  Particularly children, right?
[01:57:02.850 --> 01:57:03.931]  Because it's fast growing cells.
[01:57:04.251 --> 01:57:08.414]  You know, children, yeah, I mean, obviously children are going to be adversely affected.
[01:57:08.454 --> 01:57:10.275]  That's just a nasty way to approach it.
[01:57:10.295 --> 01:57:14.798]  But you know, their parents aren't going to be able to hold down jobs because they'll be too sick to actually hold down jobs.
[01:57:15.418 --> 01:57:18.620]  I know this is going off on a tangent, but I want to make a point on something.
[01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:21.722]  And that is, there's an awful lot of confusion right now.
[01:57:23.363 --> 01:57:34.430]  That people think that they're seeing amongst those of us on this side of the equation and by that I mean a number of doctors that I've talked about and have issues with and we have these debates and discussions.
[01:57:34.550 --> 01:57:37.632]  I want to hammer home a point.
[01:57:37.652 --> 01:57:47.519]  75 to 80 percent of what we are all talking about we are in full agreement with and the fact that we may or may not disagree on some topics doesn't mean that we've changed sides or we're splintered.
[01:57:48.039 --> 01:58:07.493]   I want that message to get out there because I want The viewers to understand that even if some of us are disagreeing on little subtle topics, the vast majority of what we're talking about, we agree on, we are completely united on, and I want everybody to hear this message, that there is not some splintering of this side of the debate and conversation.
[01:58:07.914 --> 01:58:14.098]  By and large, we are completely united in our understanding of what these people are doing and their attempts to manipulate us.
[01:58:14.519 --> 01:58:20.483]  And if Fauci on the other side thinks that this is a fractioning of our side of the debate, he is sadly mistaken.
[01:58:20.462 --> 01:58:23.782]   and people need to realize that if they're listening to us, what they're listening to
[01:58:23.782 --> 01:58:28.542]   is honest, open, scientific and medical debate and discussion, and you're not hearing that
[01:58:28.542 --> 01:58:29.862]  from the other side.
[01:58:29.862 --> 01:58:31.981]  So I just want that message to get out there.
[01:58:31.981 --> 01:58:37.282]   If you think that we are splintering apart and you have been successful, you have badly
[01:58:37.282 --> 01:58:39.301]  misjudged all of us.
[01:58:39.301 --> 01:58:40.301]  Mike?
[01:58:40.301 --> 01:58:43.301]  Yeah, I completely agree on that.
[01:58:43.290 --> 01:58:51.133]  And remember, the things that we're talking about have a basis in fact and evidence, whereas the other side, they do not want to debate anybody.
[01:58:51.153 --> 01:58:52.353]  They won't debate Dr. Fleming.
[01:58:52.733 --> 01:58:53.834]  They won't debate Steve Kirst.
[01:58:53.854 --> 01:58:56.855]  They won't debate Dr. Malone or Dr. McCullough or anybody.
[01:58:56.875 --> 01:59:00.036]  They won't debate them, because they can't handle the facts.
[01:59:00.516 --> 01:59:18.145]   And so, even though there are theories on our side, like we're talking about right now, a theory that there might be dirty bombs taking place, Well, yes, currently that's a theory, but it's a theory with a plausible basis, because the United States government is running dirty bomb drills in Austin, Texas, and it's called Cobalt Magnet!
[01:59:18.185 --> 01:59:19.866]  I mean, why do you think they called it Cobalt?
[01:59:20.146 --> 01:59:30.432]  So, even these projections that we make, and Alex, as you played, we have been right again and again and again from projections that we made two years ago, or in your case, many years ago.
[01:59:30.933 --> 01:59:31.973]  We've been right again and again.
[01:59:32.253 --> 01:59:41.262]   So, these projections have a basis in fact, not everything, not every worst case scenario Do not forget what happened at the end of World War II, when Nazis were running low on troops.
[01:59:41.282 --> 01:59:45.825]  They put their children in the front lines, holding weapons, of which American troops had to make decisions.
[01:59:45.704 --> 01:59:49.385]   before we get to the you know the dismantling of the evil and the golden
[01:59:49.385 --> 01:59:54.114]   age for humanity we're gonna go through some really difficult times no question about it do not forget what
[01:59:54.114 --> 01:59:56.345]   happened at the end of world war two
[01:59:56.345 --> 02:00:00.784]   when nazis were running low on troops they put their children
[02:00:00.784 --> 02:00:04.664]   in the front lines holding weapons of which american troops had to make
[02:00:04.664 --> 02:00:10.923]   decisions how do we do anything rockets yeah you know i mean they people will do what when they are
[02:00:10.923 --> 02:00:13.305]   desperate they will do almost anything
[02:00:13.444 --> 02:00:16.046]  Well, that's the paradox, is we're exposing the globalists.
[02:00:16.066 --> 02:00:16.706]  They're in trouble.
[02:00:16.746 --> 02:00:18.027]  That just means they double down.
[02:00:18.387 --> 02:00:20.049]  But we can't give in to what they're doing.
[02:00:20.549 --> 02:00:23.191]  But then, when we oppose them, they get even worse.
[02:00:23.691 --> 02:00:27.634]  But I guess it's better to just be on our own footing than let them run things.
[02:00:28.195 --> 02:00:35.360]  Just recognize that that means that we're making ground and we're over the target, as people like to say, and we have an obligation to our children and our grandchildren.
[02:00:36.644 --> 02:00:37.224]  All right, folks.
[02:00:37.244 --> 02:00:46.510]  We're going to have a powerful final segment ahead of the guest host that's about to take over with Mike Adams of NaturalNews.com and Dr. Richard Fleming of FlemingMethod.com.
[02:00:46.990 --> 02:00:50.212]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com and NewsWars.com and BandDot Video.
[02:00:50.672 --> 02:00:52.553]  I just hope you realize this is a live show.
[02:00:52.593 --> 02:00:53.474]  It's very powerful.
[02:00:53.954 --> 02:00:57.256]  The last two hours, I hope you'll get it later when it's archived at BandDot Video.
[02:00:57.296 --> 02:00:57.977]  I hope you share it.
[02:00:57.997 --> 02:01:11.596]   It's the only way we're going to save people when you take action.
[02:01:11.667 --> 02:01:13.609]  soil in Austin, Texas.
[02:01:13.909 --> 02:01:16.292]  What do they know that they aren't telling us?
[02:01:16.772 --> 02:01:23.419]  The self-proclaimed exercise is called Cobalt Magnet 22 and is led by the U.S.
[02:01:23.479 --> 02:01:27.624]  Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration.
[02:01:27.884 --> 02:01:36.272]  They brought more than 30 local, state, and federal agencies together to conduct a major radiological incident exercise.
[02:01:36.592 --> 02:01:39.775]  Meaning they simulated a nuclear attack on a U.S.
[02:01:39.835 --> 02:01:40.195]  city.
[02:01:40.555 --> 02:01:44.539]  Obviously they're preparing for war with Russia, as the U.S.
[02:01:44.599 --> 02:01:49.884]  government gets more involved in supporting Ukraine, both financially and militarily.
[02:01:50.164 --> 02:01:53.247]  And NATO continues to expand membership eastward.
[02:01:53.507 --> 02:01:57.109]  Something they promised Russia in 1990 that they would never do.
[02:01:57.329 --> 02:02:01.112]  War with Russia would definitely escalate to nuclear bombs.
[02:02:01.412 --> 02:02:03.293]  But who's gonna strike first?
[02:02:03.733 --> 02:02:19.903]  Texas citizens were told to expect to see protective clothing and radiological detection equipment in the field, as well as low-flying aircraft and groups of first responders acting out the radiological incident at various locations across the city.
[02:02:20.103 --> 02:02:26.388]  The exercise is meant to enable government personnel to practice protecting public health and safety.
[02:02:26.628 --> 02:02:39.097]  However, the fact that this is even taking place is an indication that the federally run intelligence agencies believe nuclear war is not only possible, but probable in the near future.
[02:02:39.437 --> 02:02:40.818]  So what are they privy to?
[02:02:41.178 --> 02:02:45.200]  What does the federal government know that they aren't telling the American people?
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:48.102]  Could a nuclear attack be coming to the U.S.
[02:02:48.142 --> 02:02:50.963]  homeland sooner than we are allowed to think?
[02:02:51.223 --> 02:02:54.065]  Perhaps this will be our only heads up.
[02:02:54.305 --> 02:03:02.655]   This is Brian Wilson with InfoWars.com So, Mike Adams talked about that last segment.
[02:03:02.675 --> 02:03:06.758]  I thought I'd play that Brian Wilson report that's at band.video here with Dr. Fleming.
[02:03:07.439 --> 02:03:08.960]  So you're right, Mike, and you're right, Dr. Fleming.
[02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:17.745]  While we're busy watching the next pandemic and that power grab, we have the economic collapse, we have the devaluation of currencies, we have a supply chain breakdown, we have the food breakdown.
[02:03:17.765 --> 02:03:19.607]  I mean, there's no doubt now.
[02:03:19.807 --> 02:03:20.828]  There's no stopping this.
[02:03:20.848 --> 02:03:22.649]  The question is how bad it's going to get, Mike Adams.
[02:03:23.717 --> 02:03:25.458]  Well, some of these things go together, too.
[02:03:25.518 --> 02:03:27.079]  So, for example, the wide-open U.S.
[02:03:27.119 --> 02:03:33.962]  southern border allows the radical Islamic terrorists to bring dirty bomb vests into the United States.
[02:03:33.982 --> 02:03:44.828]  And, again, my intel sources say that these are elaborate vests that have been engineered to be able to be disassembled and then smuggled across and then reassembled using locally acquired Cobalt-60 material.
[02:03:45.668 --> 02:03:47.189]  Some of the vests are just kinetic explosives.
[02:03:47.229 --> 02:03:50.411]  Some are explosives that have been laced with radioisotopes.
[02:03:50.891 --> 02:03:54.654]  But, these are all happening on purpose.
[02:03:54.794 --> 02:04:03.620]  Because, remember, every government and every agency, you know, DHS, FBI, NNSA, every agency needs another emergency.
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:06.001]  You know, as they say, keep the fear alive.
[02:04:06.361 --> 02:04:11.785]  If you keep the fear alive, then they get bigger budgets, they get more power, and the population is panicked.
[02:04:12.145 --> 02:04:13.186]  While they dismantle the country.
[02:04:13.206 --> 02:04:13.346]  Exactly.
[02:04:13.946 --> 02:04:14.287]  That's it.
[02:04:15.307 --> 02:04:16.048]  So what do we do, Mike?
[02:04:17.782 --> 02:04:20.943]  Well, we've got to keep exposing all of this, and I think it's working.
[02:04:21.083 --> 02:04:26.725]  I mean, look at the loss of public faith in the FBI, the CDC, the FDA.
[02:04:26.825 --> 02:04:27.865]  It's extraordinary.
[02:04:28.285 --> 02:04:37.088]  In just the last two-plus years, especially since COVID, and also, you know, the failure of the Governor Whitmer fake kidnapping plot that was an FBI plot and so on.
[02:04:37.668 --> 02:04:54.096]  The public is absolutely losing faith in these so-called institutions, and now with 2,000 mules coming out, more and more people are confirming, yes, the election was rigged, it was all stolen, which means that this Biden regime is an illegitimate, occupying, fake government.
[02:04:54.416 --> 02:04:56.798]  So, it's spreading.
[02:04:56.818 --> 02:05:07.203]  I mean, the recognition is spreading like wildfire, and we are ripe for a, shall we say, a peaceful changing of the guard in America.
[02:05:07.603 --> 02:05:13.618]  I totally agree with that, I don't want to get Dr. Fleming's take on it, but the globalists don't give up, even when it's obvious they should.
[02:05:14.577 --> 02:05:16.078]  Well, they're never going to give up.
[02:05:16.338 --> 02:05:21.362]  It's a matter of the people actually saying enough is enough and then holding these people criminally accountable.
[02:05:21.782 --> 02:05:37.993]  When I first came to Dallas about 15, 16 months ago and did my first presentation here, I looked at the people and I realized we have more than enough people who understand the information they need to understand to stand up and take back the country.
[02:05:38.514 --> 02:05:39.815]  The people are not stupid.
[02:05:40.655 --> 02:05:42.437]  They have a lot of common sense.
[02:05:42.477 --> 02:05:45.760]  I mean, somebody actually told me they hadn't taken the vaccine because they had CS.
[02:05:46.320 --> 02:05:46.921]  Common sense.
[02:05:47.781 --> 02:05:51.264]  These people are sick and tired of being manipulated.
[02:05:51.725 --> 02:05:52.686]  They have been listening.
[02:05:52.826 --> 02:05:55.128]  It feels like a slow process.
[02:05:55.148 --> 02:05:58.911]  I mean, I've had people say, why is it taking so long for the research we've done?
[02:05:59.932 --> 02:06:07.274]  With 54 years of research, 29 months doesn't seem like very long, but it's an eternity if you're living through the nightmare of those 29 months.
[02:06:07.354 --> 02:06:07.974]  I realize that.
[02:06:08.454 --> 02:06:11.695]  But Americans are getting the bigger picture.
[02:06:12.315 --> 02:06:19.357]  They're needing mobilization and being told what to do, and that's what we get all the times at these presentations.
[02:06:19.817 --> 02:06:24.639]   And that's why I've just gone straight to the jugular and saying, We need to go to the Attorney Generals.
[02:06:25.179 --> 02:06:27.519]  We need to hold these people criminally accountable.
[02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:29.440]  And it doesn't matter if it's just this group.
[02:06:29.520 --> 02:06:42.744]  If anybody thinks they're going to get by with smuggling in materials, and I agree that the way that you would detonate a nuclear device in the United States would not be to launch it from North Korea or from Moscow or any place else.
[02:06:42.804 --> 02:06:46.432]   You would get, I mean, A radiological dirty bomb.
[02:06:46.592 --> 02:06:56.400]  You would bring it in just the way that Hollywood has demonstrated, and more often than not, Hollywood has written upon information that's out there that they know how it's going to happen.
[02:06:56.480 --> 02:06:58.102]  Take a clue from Hollywood.
[02:06:58.322 --> 02:07:02.185]  That's right, they always... Mike Adams, why do they always tell you beforehand what they're going to do?
[02:07:02.205 --> 02:07:04.267]  Is it a metaphysical thing they're supposed to tell you?
[02:07:05.205 --> 02:07:14.027]  Well, yeah, there are a lot of theories about that, but there's also, I think, Hollywood often reflects the psychological awareness that's rising in the masses.
[02:07:14.527 --> 02:07:24.229]  And so, apocalypse movies, the downfall of civilization, and post-apocalypse movies, I think that reflects what people sense is actually coming.
[02:07:24.550 --> 02:07:30.271]  And remember that so much of Western civilization that operates right now is completely unsustainable.
[02:07:31.131 --> 02:07:36.535]  Just taking us off the gold standard in 1971 and look at the decades of debt upon debt upon debt.
[02:07:36.775 --> 02:07:37.656]  That's unsustainable.
[02:07:37.916 --> 02:07:41.418]  But then also we've moved away from God in this nation.
[02:07:41.478 --> 02:07:48.623]  We have these pro-abortion activists like screaming and celebrating their satanic murder of their own child.
[02:07:49.403 --> 02:07:51.645]  That wouldn't have happened probably before 1971 either.
[02:07:51.805 --> 02:08:00.411]  So there have been we've gotten away from from real money and from real spirituality or real morality.
[02:08:00.951 --> 02:08:10.416]  And when you do those things, every time throughout history, when a nation loses its monetary base, loses its morality, loses its culture, it's over.
[02:08:10.436 --> 02:08:11.356]  It's just a matter of time.
[02:08:11.636 --> 02:08:12.917]  We're in the downfall phase.
[02:08:13.017 --> 02:08:13.957]  It cannot be stopped.
[02:08:14.258 --> 02:08:20.601]  We can only hope to rebuild in a pro-Christian, pro-America, pro-freedom way after this collapse.
[02:08:20.681 --> 02:08:22.722]  And by the way, I want to be completely clear here.
[02:08:23.931 --> 02:08:25.112]  I'm not a negative person.
[02:08:25.172 --> 02:08:26.033]  I'm not a pessimist.
[02:08:26.533 --> 02:08:27.074]  I'm an optimist.
[02:08:27.134 --> 02:08:30.417]  What you're saying is totally true because here's the key.
[02:08:30.877 --> 02:08:37.723]  They are engineering in their own words the global collapse that they believe was coming so they can control what came out of it.
[02:08:38.163 --> 02:08:45.570]  We have to know the collapse is here to build the new good future instead of their post-humanist, transhumanist, exterminist plan.
[02:08:47.165 --> 02:08:51.527]  Most people haven't played chess.
[02:08:52.308 --> 02:08:57.611]  When you play chess, what you learn is that the game is over eight to nine moves before the game is over.
[02:08:58.171 --> 02:09:02.654]  You know what's happening, and the other person just playing into your hands.
[02:09:02.674 --> 02:09:10.278]  They've been playing this game of chess for a while now, and their predictions are wrong if the American people stand up.
[02:09:10.638 --> 02:09:11.659]  But it's a game of chess.
[02:09:11.819 --> 02:09:12.559]  They've been playing it.
[02:09:12.599 --> 02:09:14.100]  They've been playing it very well.
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:19.226]  I think you have to just give them credit for the fact they've been playing it and us very well.
[02:09:19.647 --> 02:09:24.493]  What they didn't account for was enough people getting together and deciding to take the country.
[02:09:24.513 --> 02:09:24.794]  That's right.
[02:09:24.814 --> 02:09:28.479]  It only works if you shut down society and kill 80% of people and nobody knows what you did.
[02:09:28.899 --> 02:09:31.322]  But even if 20% are left, they're going to get your ass, Mike Adams.
[02:09:32.230 --> 02:09:36.253]  Well, as they collapse their systems, remember, we have alternatives for everything.
[02:09:36.613 --> 02:09:40.776]  So instead of taking the vaccine, you know, we have nutrition, we have good health practices.
[02:09:40.796 --> 02:09:43.958]  They get rid of formula, suddenly breastfeeding explodes.
[02:09:43.978 --> 02:09:44.699]  Exactly right.
[02:09:44.919 --> 02:09:48.361]  Or you can make your own, you know, infant formula.
[02:09:48.702 --> 02:09:52.544]  The Price Foundation has a great recipe for that online as well.
[02:09:53.025 --> 02:09:59.609]  But there are alternatives to central bank currency, which is, you know, gold and silver and crypto and so on, and many, many alternatives.
[02:10:00.472 --> 02:10:09.994]  There are alternatives to process-centralized food production, which includes growing some of your own food or using local food, you know, community-supported agriculture, CSAs, and so on.
[02:10:10.554 --> 02:10:17.816]  And once the technology is finally no longer suppressed, we will have alternatives for decentralized energy.
[02:10:18.376 --> 02:10:19.497]  I have to keep hammering this.
[02:10:19.937 --> 02:10:22.397]  Low-energy nuclear reactions, LENR.
[02:10:22.877 --> 02:10:23.778]  It is very real.
[02:10:23.898 --> 02:10:25.338]  It used to be called cold fusion.
[02:10:25.358 --> 02:10:25.958]  That's right.
[02:10:25.998 --> 02:10:28.659]  They've been suppressing all the incredible innovations.
[02:10:29.551 --> 02:10:29.931]  That's right.
[02:10:30.212 --> 02:10:30.572]  It's real.
[02:10:30.592 --> 02:10:31.232]  It heats water.
[02:10:31.252 --> 02:10:37.338]  You can put it on ships right now and drive ships across the ocean using nothing but so-called cold fusion.
[02:10:37.378 --> 02:10:38.258]  The Navy could be using it.
[02:10:38.278 --> 02:10:39.900]  You could be heating government buildings right now.
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:48.047]  It's not yet at the size of the Mr. Fusion device for your time-traveling car, but you could heat buildings with it and you can run steam turbines with it right now.
[02:10:48.847 --> 02:10:58.912]  And medically, the medical community, a lot of us are looking at alternative approaches for providing medical care to people, not within the system that's currently being used.
[02:10:58.992 --> 02:10:59.252]  All right.
[02:10:59.272 --> 02:11:01.073]  The last two hours has been amazing.
[02:11:01.133 --> 02:11:02.233]  NaturalNews.com.
[02:11:02.253 --> 02:11:07.475]  I want to thank Mike Adams for his trailblazing work, and you as well, DrFlemingFlemingMethod.com.

[02:11:51.975 --> 02:11:54.977]  It is an opportunity to spread the word about InfoWars.
[02:11:55.577 --> 02:11:57.878]  It is an opportunity to share our articles and videos.
[02:11:58.498 --> 02:12:06.982]  It is an opportunity for your future and human liberty to buy products at InfoWarsStore.com that will enrich your life and keep us on air.
[02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:11.180]  History's happening now.

[02:12:14.381 --> 02:12:22.224]  Know that we are tireless fighters, completely committed to defending freedom and the human future against the transhumanist, satanic globalists.
[02:12:23.044 --> 02:12:24.844]  And we are having success.
[02:12:24.864 --> 02:12:39.709]  So I want to thank all the viewers and thank all the listeners and let you realize that you sponsored, you paid, like giving your military ammunition and uniforms and aircraft and intelligence to put us into the field.
[02:12:40.905 --> 02:12:43.827]  And if you hadn't done that, we wouldn't be on air today.
[02:12:43.907 --> 02:12:55.193]  So everything we've done this far has been an expression of your will, your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support.
[02:12:55.753 --> 02:13:08.480]  So I want to encourage all of you to not sit by on the sidelines if you've never bought products, or never spread the word, or never prayed for an awakening, if you've never supported the InfoWar, to be part of this fight.
[02:13:09.807 --> 02:13:17.089]  Because when you get great products at Infowarstore.com, the supplements, the books, the films, the Patriot apparel, all of it has huge effects.
[02:13:17.389 --> 02:13:23.131]  Just the t-shirts and ball caps, you'll meet like-minded people, you'll find friends, you'll discover enemies.
[02:13:23.571 --> 02:13:28.753]  It's an adventure to wear Infowars gear, to wear the Infowars uniform of liberty.
[02:13:29.313 --> 02:13:31.334]  And that's just one small part of it.
[02:13:32.394 --> 02:13:35.755]  So go to Infowarsstore.com today.
[02:13:37.202 --> 02:13:42.926]  And get things like X2 and Ultra 12 and all the other game-changing products I don't have time to tell you about.

[02:13:48.871 --> 02:13:54.455]  Again, I can't express enough on you that history is happening right now.
[02:13:55.717 --> 02:13:58.798]  And if you sit on the sidelines, you've already made a choice.
[02:13:59.499 --> 02:14:01.720]  You can join evil and serve the new world order.
[02:14:02.060 --> 02:14:04.121]  Or you can join freedom and fight for a human future.
[02:14:04.461 --> 02:14:08.423]  Or you can pretend that you're protecting yourself by not getting involved.
[02:14:08.923 --> 02:14:09.663]  That's all a lie.
[02:14:10.684 --> 02:14:14.465]  So I want to salute the listeners and viewers who over the years have supported the broadcast.
[02:14:14.886 --> 02:14:17.787]  I want to thank you for your support and salute what you've done.
[02:14:18.187 --> 02:14:22.029]  And I want to encourage those of you out there that haven't been engaged.
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:31.704]  That have just been passive to realize putting skin in the game metaphysically in front of God and the entire universe has a massive effect.
[02:14:33.364 --> 02:14:36.145]  So go now to M4WarStore.com.
[02:14:36.165 --> 02:14:38.346]  We're not backed by George Soros or big millionaires.

[02:15:02.907 --> 02:15:05.569]  But it is those of you that backed the broadcast that have done all this.
[02:15:06.049 --> 02:15:07.671]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:15:08.011 --> 02:15:11.211]  We'll be back on the other side with the great Gerald Solente.
[02:15:11.211 --> 02:15:14.211]  [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
[02:15:14.211 --> 02:15:17.690]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:15:17.690 --> 02:15:45.690]   , [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:15:45.690 --> 02:15:49.171]  [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:15:49.171 --> 02:15:50.651]  [END PLAYBACK]
[02:15:50.651 --> 02:15:55.931]  Here at InfoWars, our slogan is Tomorrow's News Today.
[02:15:54.977 --> 02:16:04.487]  Whether it's politics, or health, or spirituality, we're about bringing you the very best, documented, accurate, real-world information.

[02:16:18.585 --> 02:16:22.491]  It is the purest, highest quality atomic iodine you're going to find.
[02:16:22.711 --> 02:16:29.800]  Most other iodine out there is bound to other minerals and compounds so you don't absorb it at all or fully.
[02:16:30.521 --> 02:16:34.903]  Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a limited supply and it's been sold out for a month because of supply chain breakdowns.
[02:16:35.404 --> 02:16:39.786]  But despite that, we're selling it at 25% off for one more week.
[02:16:39.806 --> 02:16:40.807]  Then it goes back to full price.
[02:16:41.187 --> 02:16:43.308]  Within two weeks, the current sales rate is going to sell out.
[02:16:43.828 --> 02:16:47.510]  Experience X2 for yourself today at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:16:47.891 --> 02:16:49.772]  X2 at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:16:49.972 --> 02:16:50.672]  Take action now.
[02:16:51.032 --> 02:16:53.214]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:16:53.914 --> 02:16:57.476]  You know, like Alex just said, you know, get off the fence and do something.
[02:16:58.030 --> 02:17:04.114]  You know, you have no idea how disgusted I am with people that are complaining and complaining.
[02:17:04.174 --> 02:17:05.214]  I said, what are you doing about it?
[02:17:05.855 --> 02:17:07.276]  Man, what am I going to do?
[02:17:07.916 --> 02:17:08.856]  What am I going to do?
[02:17:08.876 --> 02:17:13.919]  It was just showing those pictures of the atom bombs, you know, going off back in the day.
[02:17:14.280 --> 02:17:16.601]  Oh, you talk about war criminals and crimes.
[02:17:16.981 --> 02:17:19.583]  Hey, wasn't that Harry Truman a wonderful guy?
[02:17:20.003 --> 02:17:21.164]  Yeah, bombs away.
[02:17:21.224 --> 02:17:21.464]  Yeah.
[02:17:25.896 --> 02:17:29.157]  And the word was out that Japan was already going to make a treaty.
[02:17:30.277 --> 02:17:34.258]  We have mentally ill people running and ruining our lives.
[02:17:34.638 --> 02:17:43.559]  And I am so disgusted with these arrogant people that complain about what's going on and do absolutely nothing.
[02:17:44.239 --> 02:17:44.639]  Nothing.
[02:17:45.059 --> 02:17:46.780]  Like Alex said, get off the fence.
[02:17:47.220 --> 02:17:49.580]  So get off the fence and support InfoWars.
[02:17:50.080 --> 02:17:51.040]  They have great products.
[02:17:51.120 --> 02:17:54.661]  It's not like, you know, they're asking you for money and not doing anything.
[02:17:55.603 --> 02:18:01.344]  They're asking you for support to keep the truth alive because they're robbing it from us.
[02:18:02.265 --> 02:18:09.907]  So go to InfoWarsStores.com and get these products that can help you and help InfoWars.
[02:18:10.227 --> 02:18:13.167]  Here, this is a story from the Wall Street Journal.
[02:18:15.248 --> 02:18:19.149]  Twitter sets curbs on disputed information.
[02:18:19.876 --> 02:18:22.338]  Oh, oh disputed information?
[02:18:22.698 --> 02:18:31.463]  I got some little arrogant boy, or girl, or black or white, telling me what I should think?
[02:18:32.564 --> 02:18:33.865]  Who the hell are they?
[02:18:35.126 --> 02:18:36.507]  Well, I'll tell you who.
[02:18:40.189 --> 02:18:44.592]  Twitter is adding more content guardrails.
[02:18:45.893 --> 02:18:47.954]  Isn't that a nice term?
[02:18:48.539 --> 02:19:06.402]  Little boys and girls, Twitter is adding guardrails for all you ignorant, stupid people who can only swallow the garbage that they shoved down your throat.
[02:19:09.123 --> 02:19:18.350]   The company said Thursday that it plans to slow what it deems Misinformation.
[02:19:20.051 --> 02:19:20.411]  Oh, what?
[02:19:20.971 --> 02:19:23.132]  It deems misinformation?
[02:19:23.572 --> 02:19:24.933]  Why, that's sexist.
[02:19:25.333 --> 02:19:26.613]  Misinformation?
[02:19:27.274 --> 02:19:31.135]  Oh, yeah, wasn't she going to be ahead of that government thing over there to watch us?
[02:19:31.995 --> 02:19:33.216]  Misinformation.
[02:19:34.416 --> 02:19:35.617]  How about mandates?
[02:19:35.797 --> 02:19:37.017]  Well, mands don't date.
[02:19:38.137 --> 02:19:38.518]  Anyway.
[02:19:40.558 --> 02:19:44.700]  Around crises, including armed conflicts.
[02:19:44.740 --> 02:19:45.280]  That's right.
[02:19:47.301 --> 02:19:54.422]  The Twitter twitheads are going to tell us what we should think about what's going on.
[02:19:55.142 --> 02:19:58.883]  Because you have to listen to journalism.
[02:19:58.903 --> 02:20:01.424]  There's no journalism.
[02:20:02.184 --> 02:20:14.106]  Look at the crap that the toilet paper a record, the New York slime, one after another, all the moronic garbage on.
[02:20:16.240 --> 02:20:30.950]  The networks, yeah, of which five companies control 90% of all of it, thanks to the breakup of it by Bill Clinton, the 1996 Federal Communications Act, but we won't talk about that.
[02:20:31.371 --> 02:20:44.020]  The big story is that more people, you saw the survey, more people are concerned about Johnny Depp and his herd or whatever she is than anything else.
[02:20:46.133 --> 02:20:52.237]  What journalist would publish and promote?
[02:20:53.979 --> 02:20:57.921]  Who the hell cares what's going on between these two people?
[02:20:58.562 --> 02:20:59.322]  That's news?
[02:21:00.743 --> 02:21:05.046]  Yes, according to Twitter and all the Twitheads.
[02:21:07.728 --> 02:21:09.630]  And you can spell that any way you want.
[02:21:12.672 --> 02:21:12.832]  Yep.
[02:21:16.297 --> 02:21:33.346]  It deems information around crises, including armed conflicts, natural disasters, public health emergencies, yep, and credible information.
[02:21:33.486 --> 02:21:34.787]  It will elevate.
[02:21:34.967 --> 02:21:37.828]  It will elevate critical information.
[02:21:38.108 --> 02:21:39.969]  They will elevate what they think.
[02:21:41.010 --> 02:21:42.470]  Can you imagine this is happening?
[02:21:42.490 --> 02:21:43.231]  Of course you can.
[02:21:43.631 --> 02:21:45.332]  Because look at the public school system.
[02:21:46.004 --> 02:21:46.564]  Look what's happened.
[02:21:46.584 --> 02:21:47.985]  The government school system.
[02:21:48.485 --> 02:21:50.466]  Look at the garbage they teach.
[02:21:52.446 --> 02:22:10.152]  The company said it would determine whether claims are misleading through verification from multiple, credible, publicly available sources.
[02:22:10.873 --> 02:22:12.273]  Can you believe this?
[02:22:13.153 --> 02:22:14.514]  Can you believe this?
[02:22:15.325 --> 02:22:16.346]  Of course you can.
[02:22:17.886 --> 02:22:19.387]  It's the U.S.S.A.
[02:22:20.188 --> 02:22:22.829]  United Soviet States of America.
[02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:26.611]  This country's declined into garbage.
[02:22:27.891 --> 02:22:30.333]  And we got garbage men in control.
[02:22:32.674 --> 02:22:33.354]  Did you see?
[02:22:33.454 --> 02:22:34.335]  Of course you did.
[02:22:34.795 --> 02:22:37.496]  About almost 30 million people, I think, saw those.
[02:22:40.678 --> 02:22:44.080]  The videos, a little daddy's boy, Bush.
[02:22:44.830 --> 02:22:45.090]  Yeah.
[02:22:45.711 --> 02:22:47.112]  Little Georgie Bush.
[02:22:49.294 --> 02:22:51.936]  Little Georgie Bush, a daddy's boy.
[02:22:52.216 --> 02:22:59.842]  He'd be nobody there if daddy wasn't George W. And then there was Grandpa Prescott.
[02:22:59.882 --> 02:23:02.905]  Yeah, that sold the stuff to the Nazis.
[02:23:02.965 --> 02:23:04.086]  Yeah, that Prescott.
[02:23:04.146 --> 02:23:04.546]  Oh, yeah.
[02:23:04.886 --> 02:23:06.788]  And all the other deals that they've done.
[02:23:09.446 --> 02:23:27.456]  You saw the interview with the pranksters from Ukraine, pretending one guy that he was Zelensky, and the other guy, two guys saying they were, you know, brave soldiers.
[02:23:28.737 --> 02:23:41.239]   And that was the clip they just showed of Bush before that condemning The murderous actions of Russia with their invasion of Iraq.
[02:23:41.979 --> 02:23:45.922]  Yeah, he said what Russia is doing, exactly what he did.
[02:23:47.282 --> 02:24:00.470]  That you have this clown, this moronic clown, when you watch the video of him going, I'm not making this up, man.
[02:24:00.491 --> 02:24:16.065]   This guy's, this guy is, oh, oh, you know why he invaded Iraq, under the lies, of course, that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.
[02:24:16.085 --> 02:24:16.845]  This is a quote.
[02:24:19.086 --> 02:24:21.207]  Saddam Hussein tried to kill his daddy.
[02:24:22.047 --> 02:24:22.547]  His daddy.
[02:24:26.629 --> 02:24:27.649]  Here's the deal.
[02:24:28.569 --> 02:24:31.250]  I'm going to make this 100% clear.
[02:24:33.311 --> 02:24:35.452]  Putin got a problem with Zelensky.
[02:24:36.072 --> 02:24:38.113]  Zelensky got a problem with Putin.
[02:24:39.264 --> 02:24:39.684]  All right.
[02:24:40.365 --> 02:24:41.225]  Step right up.
[02:24:41.566 --> 02:24:42.386]  Step right up.
[02:24:43.507 --> 02:24:44.767]  Let's have a fight.
[02:24:45.228 --> 02:24:45.628]  Yeah!
[02:24:46.068 --> 02:24:49.150]  We'll have billions of people tuning in.
[02:24:50.591 --> 02:24:55.654]  Let... They want to fight each other?
[02:24:56.835 --> 02:24:58.476]  Don't send us to go do it.
[02:25:00.157 --> 02:25:01.258]  Put them in the ring!
[02:25:02.298 --> 02:25:02.779]  Yeah!
[02:25:02.799 --> 02:25:03.419]  The match!
[02:25:06.781 --> 02:25:08.222]  Comedian Zelinsky?
[02:25:09.815 --> 02:25:16.537]  Against President Putin.
[02:25:17.157 --> 02:25:18.258]  Oh, Biden.
[02:25:18.738 --> 02:25:19.838]  I know they're backtracking.
[02:25:19.898 --> 02:25:24.940]  Biden said we're going to stand up if China takes over Taiwan.
[02:25:25.140 --> 02:25:26.340]  Oh, is Biden going to fight?
[02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:37.604]  You mean the arrogant, the arrogant, war-loving, warmonger, little arrogant Biden who beat the Vietnam War?
[02:25:38.064 --> 02:25:38.964]  Yeah.
[02:25:39.798 --> 02:25:40.659]  Yeah.
[02:25:41.879 --> 02:25:44.021]  Got all those draft deferments.
[02:25:44.481 --> 02:25:49.404]  Oh, you were a coward, but you want to go send other people to go fight?
[02:25:50.005 --> 02:25:52.246]  Why don't you go lead the charge?
[02:25:53.027 --> 02:25:54.668]  Out of your mind, Biden.
[02:25:55.468 --> 02:25:58.730]  Oh, how about Mittens Romney this weekend?
[02:25:59.191 --> 02:26:10.617]   Mittens Romney shooting off his mouth about you're either with Ukraine You're either with us or with the Russians.
[02:26:10.697 --> 02:26:16.460]  In other words, like George W. Bush, you're either with us or with the terrorists.
[02:26:16.961 --> 02:26:18.902]  Little Mittens rhyme me.
[02:26:19.142 --> 02:26:20.143]  Oh, I'm a Mormon.
[02:26:20.303 --> 02:26:20.983]  I'm a Mormon.
[02:26:21.303 --> 02:26:22.344]  I can't go fight.
[02:26:22.724 --> 02:26:24.525]  I can't go fight in Vietnam.
[02:26:25.085 --> 02:26:27.227]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:27.267 --> 02:26:31.609]  And as I keep saying, you know, they're going to keep robbing us of our freedom.
[02:26:31.689 --> 02:26:33.150]  We saw it with the COVID war.
[02:26:34.099 --> 02:26:34.839]  I'm the mayor.
[02:26:34.999 --> 02:26:35.740]  I'm the governor.
[02:26:35.800 --> 02:26:36.680]  I'm the president.
[02:26:36.780 --> 02:26:37.660]  I'm a clown.
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:39.141]  I'm a bureaucrat.
[02:26:39.781 --> 02:26:41.741]  We're going to lock down and flatten the curve.
[02:26:41.761 --> 02:26:44.362]  We're going to destroy your life and we'll tell you what to do.
[02:26:44.422 --> 02:26:44.802]  All right.
[02:26:44.822 --> 02:26:47.303]  And I just read to you what Twitter's doing.
[02:26:47.763 --> 02:26:49.524]  You know, misinformation.
[02:26:51.013 --> 02:26:52.594]  So, support InfoWars.
[02:26:52.634 --> 02:26:56.618]  Go to InfoWarsStores.com and get these great products.
[02:26:56.678 --> 02:26:59.160]  One of my favorites is Super Male Vitality.
[02:26:59.520 --> 02:27:00.581]  Gotta get that vitality.
[02:27:00.781 --> 02:27:02.402]  You know, I'm the same age as Bush.
[02:27:03.003 --> 02:27:05.345]  Same age as Janet Yellen.
[02:27:05.665 --> 02:27:07.987]  Man, I hope I'm not out of their mind like they are.
[02:27:08.007 --> 02:27:09.088]  I look like what they do.
[02:27:09.708 --> 02:27:17.395]  And one of the reasons I don't is I use a number of those great products from InfoWarsStores.com.
[02:27:17.475 --> 02:27:19.897]  So, do what you can to support the truth.
[02:27:20.703 --> 02:27:24.466]  I was mentioning about Mittens Romney, another arrogant clown.
[02:27:24.886 --> 02:27:28.309]  Oh, he can't get enough.
[02:27:28.629 --> 02:27:37.016]  Governor of Massachusetts up there, and then he goes to Utah because he's got a lot of Mormons over there to vote for him.
[02:27:37.036 --> 02:27:38.837]  He gets in and he doesn't stop.
[02:27:39.458 --> 02:27:40.739]  Keeps running for president.
[02:27:41.159 --> 02:27:44.382]  And now, again, you're a tough guy, right?
[02:27:45.089 --> 02:27:50.892]  You want to keep going to war, but you did everything you can to beat the Vietnam War, right?
[02:27:51.473 --> 02:28:01.498]  Oh, and you supported every war, but none of your five sons fought the Afghan war that you loved, the Iraq war that you loved.
[02:28:02.059 --> 02:28:04.140]  You are a fraud.
[02:28:04.520 --> 02:28:11.484]  You are a little piece of garbage calling for war when you're a coward.
[02:28:14.807 --> 02:28:17.788]  Quote, this is out of Mittens' mouth.
[02:28:18.228 --> 02:28:20.348]  Little Mittens, little Mittens.
[02:28:21.769 --> 02:28:30.171]  NATO could engage in Ukraine, potentially obliterating Russia's struggling military, he said.
[02:28:30.191 --> 02:28:45.830]   Quote, further, we could confront China and every other nation with a choice much like that George W. Bush gave the world after September Eleventh.
[02:28:47.071 --> 02:28:50.552]  You're either with us, or you are with Russia.
[02:28:51.472 --> 02:28:53.452]  You cannot be with both.
[02:28:55.073 --> 02:28:55.353]  Yep.
[02:28:55.893 --> 02:28:59.474]  Yeah, shove that thing up your you-know-what!
[02:29:02.835 --> 02:29:03.115]  Yeah.
[02:29:04.156 --> 02:29:12.058]  Repeating George W. Bush, the war criminal, who lied us into the Iraq War.
[02:29:13.377 --> 02:29:16.800]  Oh, you love that 20 year Afghan war, huh?
[02:29:18.221 --> 02:29:22.225]  We're going to get Osama Bin Laden dead or alive.
[02:29:22.725 --> 02:29:25.568]  Yeah, I used to see that in the old westerns.
[02:29:25.968 --> 02:29:27.029]  I'm not making this up.
[02:29:30.212 --> 02:29:32.774]  We have lunatics in charge.
[02:29:33.655 --> 02:29:36.678]  You see a crazy person walking down the street.
[02:29:37.178 --> 02:29:39.040]  You know, they're out of their minds.
[02:29:42.264 --> 02:30:00.814]  These psychopaths, these sociopaths, these pathological liars, like the Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, Barack Obama, quote, I'm really good at killing people in the book Double Down, they know how to pull it off.
[02:30:01.975 --> 02:30:10.820]  They are as mentally ill as the most mentally ill person you've seen in your life, and worse.
[02:30:12.017 --> 02:30:13.818]  Because they commit mass murder.
[02:30:15.058 --> 02:30:16.318]  Oh, Russian war, you know.
[02:30:16.759 --> 02:30:18.559]  Oh, it's not going the way they planned.
[02:30:19.139 --> 02:30:20.920]  No, it's one after another.
[02:30:20.940 --> 02:30:22.640]  You're seeing all the stories coming out.
[02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:23.301]  Yeah.
[02:30:24.681 --> 02:30:26.081]  About how, yeah.
[02:30:27.322 --> 02:30:27.702]  You ready?
[02:30:27.842 --> 02:30:33.284]  Ukraine intelligence chief says Russian forces will be expelled.
[02:30:34.124 --> 02:30:35.925]  That's out of the Wall Street Journal.
[02:30:39.066 --> 02:30:40.446]  On the 21st of this month.
[02:30:41.089 --> 02:30:41.930]  Couple of days ago.
[02:30:43.191 --> 02:30:44.331]  Oh, this guy knows.
[02:30:46.713 --> 02:30:48.214]  An intelligence chief, huh?
[02:30:48.735 --> 02:30:51.597]  Oh, like the intelligence like we got in this country?
[02:30:52.898 --> 02:30:53.358]  Remember?
[02:30:53.438 --> 02:30:54.939]  Oh, we're winning in Afghanistan.
[02:30:54.979 --> 02:30:56.000]  We're winning in Iraq.
[02:30:57.481 --> 02:30:58.942]  These are warmongers.
[02:30:58.962 --> 02:31:01.084]  They're mentally ill people.
[02:31:01.124 --> 02:31:05.327]  They should be calling for peace before there is more destruction.
[02:31:06.127 --> 02:31:11.735]   But the comedian playing president over there, Ukraine, No ceasefire talks.
[02:31:12.395 --> 02:31:13.675]  Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[02:31:14.075 --> 02:31:15.296]  We're in complete control.
[02:31:15.656 --> 02:31:19.337]  Russia has to stop what they're doing, get out of here, and we won't.
[02:31:19.697 --> 02:31:37.923]  Again, we wrote about it in detail in the Trends Journal, one magazine after another, about how, yeah, 2014, the United States overthrew the democratically elected government of Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine.
[02:31:39.304 --> 02:31:40.485]  It's been going on since.
[02:31:42.606 --> 02:32:11.075]   So, when you look at that video of little Georgie, daddy's boy, Bush, born on third base and thought he had a grand slam, you will see the mental illness that pervades throughout this Nation.
[02:32:12.336 --> 02:32:14.318]  Hey, how about that Archbishop over there?
[02:32:14.338 --> 02:32:20.383]  I love these people, like, you know, I don't care what religion you belong to, you know, be whoever you want.
[02:32:22.164 --> 02:32:29.490]  But, you know, don't use your thing that you're a Mormon, and you can't go fight in the wars when other Mormons have.
[02:32:30.571 --> 02:32:35.955]  Like Little Mittens did, didn't go to Vietnam, and his sons didn't go fight.
[02:32:39.558 --> 02:32:44.568]   Or Professor Like, what just happened to Nancy Pelosi?
[02:32:45.929 --> 02:32:46.129]  Yeah.
[02:32:46.929 --> 02:32:49.950]  Can you imagine Nancy Pelosi running the show in Washington?
[02:32:50.271 --> 02:32:51.651]  Oh, that's her daddy's girl.
[02:32:51.891 --> 02:32:54.873]  Yeah, her daddy was mayor of Baltimore and Baltimore was at the top.
[02:32:55.593 --> 02:32:55.853]  You know?
[02:32:56.354 --> 02:32:56.554]  Yeah.
[02:32:56.894 --> 02:33:00.415]  It's one big club and you ain't in it, as George Carlin used to say.
[02:33:00.856 --> 02:33:03.377]  And that Archbishop wouldn't give a communion, right?
[02:33:05.458 --> 02:33:07.599]  Because she's pro-abortion.
[02:33:08.849 --> 02:33:13.870]  How about not giving a communion because she's pro-war?
[02:33:16.331 --> 02:33:25.593]  How about the murder of all those people that she supported all these years, along with the Roman Catholic Biden?
[02:33:25.893 --> 02:33:28.773]  You're really Roman from Catholicism.
[02:33:30.334 --> 02:33:31.834]  Oh, Jesus would have loved you.
[02:33:32.441 --> 02:33:33.262]  Jesus loves!
[02:33:33.562 --> 02:33:35.503]  Keep sending those deadly weapons!
[02:33:36.043 --> 02:33:38.284]  Jesus would've loved that!
[02:33:38.304 --> 02:33:40.166]  Amen!
[02:33:40.526 --> 02:33:42.467]  And hey, women, for Pelosi!
[02:33:44.288 --> 02:33:45.329]  What hypocrites!
[02:33:47.470 --> 02:33:50.812]  It's a freak show in front of everybody's eyes!
[02:33:51.212 --> 02:33:52.613]  Hey, did you see Buddha Gig lately?
[02:33:53.353 --> 02:33:55.094]  What freaks we got!
[02:33:55.675 --> 02:33:59.217]  Telling us what to do in a country near you!
[02:34:00.802 --> 02:34:02.323]  How about that guy Boris Johnson?
[02:34:02.663 --> 02:34:08.248]  Oh yeah, had all them parties, you know, while he locked down everybody and got a slap on the wrist.
[02:34:08.848 --> 02:34:10.489]  And that's what the whole system is.
[02:34:13.471 --> 02:34:17.915]  Prosecution to the fullest, but we the little people of Slavelandia, huh?
[02:34:18.855 --> 02:34:22.018]  While the bigs get a slap on the wrist in their murderous acts.
[02:34:22.771 --> 02:34:25.513]  George W. Bush should be brought up.
[02:34:25.833 --> 02:34:37.320]  We should have a Nuremberg trial 2.0 for him, Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and all the rest that lied us into that war.
[02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:41.522]  So in the meantime, let's take a break.
[02:34:41.762 --> 02:34:43.763]  Go to Infowarsstores.com.
[02:34:44.984 --> 02:34:47.526]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:48.326 --> 02:34:49.567]  And remember, do what you can.
[02:34:50.523 --> 02:34:55.045]  To support InfoWars, go to InfoWarsStores.com.
[02:34:55.706 --> 02:35:00.949]  You know what Alex is saying about, you know, censorship and everything that he's been saying.
[02:35:00.969 --> 02:35:01.969]  He's right on target.
[02:35:01.989 --> 02:35:07.852]  You know, the new world disorder has taken over our lives.
[02:35:08.193 --> 02:35:10.054]  I'm so glad I'm an older guy, man.
[02:35:10.654 --> 02:35:14.736]  I would, what's happened, they sucked the joy out of life.
[02:35:16.037 --> 02:35:21.769]   Up here, where I am in Kingston, this whole area up here, New York, Northern New York, Dead, dead at night.
[02:35:22.850 --> 02:35:23.850]  Nine o'clock, dead.
[02:35:25.090 --> 02:35:26.191]  Places closed up.
[02:35:26.691 --> 02:35:36.774]  The damage that these sick people did with fighting the COVID war, flattening the curve.
[02:35:37.174 --> 02:35:37.614]  Remember that?
[02:35:37.634 --> 02:35:39.215]  We're going to flatten the curve?
[02:35:40.295 --> 02:35:43.096]  They flattened billions of lives and livelihoods.
[02:35:44.657 --> 02:35:45.777]  It's not coming back.
[02:35:47.277 --> 02:35:49.178]  As inflation is skyrocketing.
[02:35:50.379 --> 02:35:59.365]  And when you put the real inflation number in there, when you go to John Williams' shadow stat, no, it's not 8.3% inflation, it's more like 17%.
[02:36:00.406 --> 02:36:06.770]  On housing prices that blew up, no, no, that doesn't go in there, we don't include that.
[02:36:07.530 --> 02:36:10.672]  The price of steak, no, that doesn't go up, people are eating chopped meat now.
[02:36:11.192 --> 02:36:12.213]  They rigged the numbers.
[02:36:13.094 --> 02:36:24.823]   They rigged the numbers so they don't have to pay you more Social Security, because Social Security is aligned to Consumer Price Index and also so you could keep pumping and all that cheap money.
[02:36:25.864 --> 02:36:29.567]  And that's what's artificially inflated these markets and the economy.
[02:36:29.967 --> 02:36:31.088]  And now that's running out.
[02:36:32.930 --> 02:36:38.354]  Again, it's not stagflation that we're going to be facing.
[02:36:38.995 --> 02:36:43.679]  Stagflation is a stagnant economy with rising inflation.
[02:36:44.159 --> 02:36:45.821]  It's going to be dragflation.
[02:36:46.638 --> 02:36:49.639]  Economies are dragging down around the world.
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:51.080]  It's on InfoWars.
[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:57.623]  That guy saw it on the site about what the IMF is saying about the future and how bleak it's becoming.
[02:36:59.144 --> 02:37:00.364]  The international mafia.
[02:37:00.444 --> 02:37:01.525]  I'm a monetary fund.
[02:37:01.585 --> 02:37:02.685]  I got to be proper here.
[02:37:03.166 --> 02:37:03.426]  Yeah.
[02:37:04.666 --> 02:37:10.229]  And according to the IMF, by the way, interest rates when they loan money out.
[02:37:14.131 --> 02:37:14.791]  Here's the deal.
[02:37:18.459 --> 02:37:25.702]  Your interest rates in a country that they borrow money from the IMF, they have to be 1% above inflation.
[02:37:27.122 --> 02:37:27.502]  All right?
[02:37:28.203 --> 02:37:34.465]  Which means that our interest rates now, the overnight rate is between, you know, 0.75 and 1%.
[02:37:37.086 --> 02:37:44.648]  It should be, according to the fake official numbers, 9.3% interest rate.
[02:37:47.481 --> 02:38:03.204]  And I went back before showing you the cover of this Trends Journal back in December 2014 when Victoria Nuland and John McCain were handing out candy in Maidan Square in Ukraine.
[02:38:03.484 --> 02:38:09.165]  Could you imagine if the Russians were over here handing out candy in protests and pushing protests?
[02:38:09.525 --> 02:38:10.325]  That'd be different.
[02:38:10.365 --> 02:38:22.165]   But anyway, the deal was that Ukraine's been going bust since they broke up with the Soviet, when the Soviet Union broke up in 1990, early 1990s.
[02:38:23.845 --> 02:38:24.745]  And they needed money.
[02:38:25.966 --> 02:38:29.267]  So they're going to make a deal with the IMF and the EU.
[02:38:31.148 --> 02:38:35.269]  And Viktor Yanukovych, the president of the Ukraine said, okay, we're going to go with that.
[02:38:36.310 --> 02:38:38.751]  And then Putin came in and said, no, I can give you a better deal.
[02:38:39.491 --> 02:38:45.903]   I'll give you lower interest rates and I'll cut the price of gas and oil for you.
[02:38:46.703 --> 02:38:48.485]  Okay, we'll go with you.
[02:38:50.146 --> 02:38:54.329]  And that was the beginning of the end from what happened in Ukraine.
[02:38:55.910 --> 02:39:03.336]  That's when the United States overthrew the country and they had the Minsk Agreement where the Donbass regions would separate.
[02:39:03.376 --> 02:39:10.681]  They would be not a separate country, but they'd be able to run themselves, you know, as a separate entity within Ukraine.
[02:39:11.382 --> 02:39:12.843]  That was the deal.
[02:39:13.470 --> 02:39:15.291]  And it was violated.
[02:39:16.391 --> 02:39:26.515]  And they killed, again, the media every day shows, you know, you know, what's going on in Ukraine, buildings blown up, etc.
[02:39:27.095 --> 02:39:31.616]  But they never show the 15,000 people in Donbass region that have been killed.
[02:39:32.497 --> 02:39:32.817]  At none.
[02:39:33.582 --> 02:39:46.832]  And the media never showed day after day on the little Georgie Bush's wars what was going on in Iraq with the death of an estimated million plus people and the destruction of the entire country.
[02:39:47.172 --> 02:39:49.414]  No, they weren't showing that day after day.
[02:39:49.474 --> 02:39:50.055]  You know why?
[02:39:50.655 --> 02:39:52.136]  Because they're prostitutes.
[02:39:52.917 --> 02:40:00.002]  They're media whores that get paid to put out by their corporate pimps and their government whoremasters.
[02:40:01.023 --> 02:40:02.064]  So they do what they're told.
[02:40:03.021 --> 02:40:11.467]  But now all they're doing is showing what's going on over here, going on in Ukraine, but never did they show America's war atrocities.
[02:40:12.247 --> 02:40:18.231]  So America to be talking about, and again, I launched Occupy Peace, OccupyPeace.com.
[02:40:18.251 --> 02:40:20.232]  So I'm not just talking empty.
[02:40:20.993 --> 02:40:29.557]   And I did that back when The Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner Obama was slaughtering people in Libya and in Syria.
[02:40:29.937 --> 02:40:34.961]  Assad has to go, he said of the President of Syria.
[02:40:36.101 --> 02:40:47.189]  What makes him different than a murderer up in Buffalo over there that killed all these, this crazy person that killed all these kids, all these people in that store?
[02:40:49.671 --> 02:40:51.933]  Well, how about saying Gaddafi has to go?
[02:40:53.334 --> 02:40:55.496]  Which he said, along with Hillary Clinton.
[02:40:56.296 --> 02:41:00.179]  And when Gaddafi was dead, we came, we saw he died.
[02:41:00.199 --> 02:41:01.220]  Yeah.
[02:41:02.681 --> 02:41:08.666]  What makes them not a criminal that want to go and all the people that died and destroyed Libya?
[02:41:08.726 --> 02:41:10.367]  Libya is a hellhole now.
[02:41:11.408 --> 02:41:12.909]  It was the richest country in Africa.
[02:41:13.289 --> 02:41:17.872]  What makes them any different than you want gun control?
[02:41:18.793 --> 02:41:19.714]  Let's start with them.
[02:41:20.535 --> 02:41:30.941]  Oh, gun control for us, but you can send all the weapons of death to bloody the killing fields anywhere and any place you want to go, but we're not allowed to have guns.
[02:41:32.442 --> 02:41:48.051]  Anyway, speaking of which, by the way, the Chancellor over there in Germany, Olaf Scholz, he is only something we can take for granted.
[02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:50.321]  If we're prepared to defend it?
[02:41:52.602 --> 02:41:57.964]  This is a lesson that we have learned from brutal Russian attacks on Ukraine, he said.
[02:41:57.984 --> 02:42:09.369]  A brutally attacked country needs help in defending itself, and doing so cannot be termed escalation.
[02:42:09.569 --> 02:42:10.089]  Oh, okay.
[02:42:10.869 --> 02:42:16.805]   Oh, you mean the Germans that killed Some 25 million Russians in World War II?
[02:42:17.365 --> 02:42:19.285]  Oh, Operation Barbarossa?
[02:42:20.085 --> 02:42:26.706]  Because he goes on to say that Russia can't win.
[02:42:26.726 --> 02:42:28.767]  That's right.
[02:42:28.967 --> 02:42:29.467]  His words.
[02:42:32.607 --> 02:42:33.427]  Russia can't win.
[02:42:35.128 --> 02:42:38.588]  And in a speech, we have one goal.
[02:42:39.529 --> 02:42:41.889]  Russia must not win this war!
[02:42:43.834 --> 02:42:49.277]  The Chancellor said, how about mind your own business?
[02:42:49.317 --> 02:42:51.338]  This is going on between Ukraine and Russia.
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.942]  Been going on for like a thousand years between these two countries.
[02:42:56.962 --> 02:42:57.882]  It ain't my trip.
[02:42:58.723 --> 02:43:00.183]  I am an American!
[02:43:00.203 --> 02:43:05.586]  I believe in people like George Washington!
[02:43:05.606 --> 02:43:07.768]  A real man!
[02:43:09.281 --> 02:43:10.702]  Oh yeah, he crossed the Delaware?
[02:43:10.722 --> 02:43:12.123]  Oh, did he go over the bridge?
[02:43:12.543 --> 02:43:13.924]  No, I think he took a plane.
[02:43:14.925 --> 02:43:16.285]  No, he fought.
[02:43:18.046 --> 02:43:24.750]  His farewell address, warning the American people, no foreign entanglements.
[02:43:28.052 --> 02:43:37.078]  No foreign entanglements and warning not to get involved in anything in Europe.
[02:43:38.962 --> 02:43:39.962]  Don't take a side.
[02:43:40.022 --> 02:43:41.083]  Like them, dislike them.
[02:43:41.163 --> 02:43:42.083]  It's not your trip.
[02:43:42.783 --> 02:43:43.724]  We're Americans.
[02:43:44.864 --> 02:43:46.565]  America first and only.
[02:43:48.545 --> 02:43:52.307]  If we were fighting Mexico, you think the Ukrainians would be helping us?
[02:43:55.348 --> 02:43:57.648]  No, I think the people from Slovakia would.
[02:43:58.029 --> 02:43:59.329]  Well, I think Bulgaria.
[02:44:00.469 --> 02:44:02.010]  I think you're out of your mind.
[02:44:02.510 --> 02:44:04.011]  Well, I must be Mittens or Romney.
[02:44:04.291 --> 02:44:05.611]  No, little Georgie Bush.
[02:44:06.331 --> 02:44:07.572]  It's a freak show!
[02:44:08.297 --> 02:44:09.578]  It's a freak show!
[02:44:10.759 --> 02:44:11.820]  Support InfoWars.
[02:44:12.020 --> 02:44:12.721]  We'll be right back.
[02:44:13.322 --> 02:44:15.323]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:44:15.924 --> 02:44:21.909]  And again, do what you can to support InfoWars because InfoWars is supporting you.
[02:44:21.929 --> 02:44:29.997]  What they're putting out there, the work that they do, the staff that they have, the productions, I mean, you know, they're the top of the top.
[02:44:30.377 --> 02:44:31.598]  You know, I was on with everybody.
[02:44:32.119 --> 02:44:34.601]  You know, Oprah, the Today Show, Good Morning America.
[02:44:35.536 --> 02:44:36.076]  You name it.
[02:44:36.216 --> 02:44:36.957]  I used to do it.
[02:44:37.237 --> 02:44:37.617]  Fox.
[02:44:38.077 --> 02:44:38.417]  All of them.
[02:44:39.198 --> 02:44:43.340]  And what InfoWars is doing, they're the top of the top.
[02:44:44.020 --> 02:44:46.661]  Way beyond these clown shows that they have out there.
[02:44:47.421 --> 02:44:51.263]  And they're giving you information that you could think for yourself.
[02:44:52.184 --> 02:44:53.464]  So support InfoWars.
[02:44:53.504 --> 02:44:58.314]   Their products are Serving you as well as serving InfoWars.
[02:44:58.974 --> 02:45:09.860]  And you got these, you know, these supercharged, your natural potential, the powerful source of energy and B12, you know, one great product after another.
[02:45:10.461 --> 02:45:11.702]  So you get 40% off.
[02:45:11.742 --> 02:45:12.462]  So order now.
[02:45:13.222 --> 02:45:15.864]  Go to InfoWarsStores.com.
[02:45:16.504 --> 02:45:17.725]  The future is in your hands.
[02:45:17.785 --> 02:45:18.526]  Don't drop it.
[02:45:19.206 --> 02:45:21.347]  Again, I'm sick and tired of people doing nothing.
[02:45:22.108 --> 02:45:24.069]  And I got a lot of people I know that do nothing.
[02:45:24.952 --> 02:45:38.083]  You know, and I, some friends do a lot, like Anthony Frieda, who does the covers of our Trends Journal, and Joe Duran, who got a great book here, by the way, Leaving Humanity by Joe Duran.
[02:45:38.723 --> 02:45:39.684]  And I wrote the foreword.
[02:45:39.764 --> 02:45:47.831]  It's a book you could get on Amazon, all the places, you know, Barnes and Noble.
[02:45:48.751 --> 02:45:51.694]  And it's so, I mean, there are people that are fighting for freedom.
[02:45:52.674 --> 02:45:55.016]  Again, united we stand, divided we fall.
[02:45:57.617 --> 02:45:58.278]  We die.
[02:45:59.579 --> 02:46:04.582]  And talking about the freaks running the show, Kamala Harris stands up for personal decisions.
[02:46:05.743 --> 02:46:19.632]  After a year of finding no fault... Again, this is the person that was out there pushing, pushing, pushing the Operation Warp Speed COVID inoculation.
[02:46:20.772 --> 02:46:21.393]  Non-stop.
[02:46:22.916 --> 02:46:28.498]  And supporting the denial, no jab, no jobs, to people that refuse to get them.
[02:46:29.959 --> 02:46:32.840]  The hypocrisy spewing out of her mouth.
[02:46:35.381 --> 02:46:39.002]  Because, of course, I'm talking about her stand on abortion.
[02:46:39.642 --> 02:46:41.783]  And again, I'm not saying which side to take.
[02:46:42.483 --> 02:46:44.444]  I'm just talking about the hypocrisy of it.
[02:46:46.985 --> 02:46:49.566]  This is what she said about the Supreme Court.
[02:46:50.106 --> 02:46:53.715]   They say that they may overturn Roe vs. Wade.
[02:46:54.316 --> 02:46:59.598]  Quote, at its core, this is about our future as a nation.
[02:47:00.958 --> 02:47:06.961]  About whether we live in a country where the government can interfere in personal decisions.
[02:47:08.501 --> 02:47:10.062]  This is about our future.
[02:47:10.742 --> 02:47:24.363]   Pure hypocrisy and those little gutless boys and girls, the little prostitutes, That suck up and bow down to those higher than them.
[02:47:24.383 --> 02:47:27.224]  Never call her out for this.
[02:47:28.724 --> 02:47:30.165]  Or all the other people.
[02:47:30.185 --> 02:47:34.187]  None of them.
[02:47:35.407 --> 02:47:40.689]  Like those little clowns that call themselves liberals and anti-war.
[02:47:41.470 --> 02:47:42.430]  They're a little jerk.
[02:47:42.650 --> 02:47:43.551]  They're a little nothing.
[02:47:43.911 --> 02:47:44.691]  Little nothing.
[02:47:45.191 --> 02:47:46.312]  Little nothings.
[02:47:49.048 --> 02:47:50.409]  Cartoon News Network.
[02:47:54.632 --> 02:47:55.053]  You ready?
[02:47:56.013 --> 02:48:15.909]  On May 10th, every, every Democrat in Congress voted to approve stealing $40 billion of our money as the roads are rotted and the bridges are falling down and people are going bust to send to Ukraine.
[02:48:17.188 --> 02:48:20.330]  We only got a $30 trillion deficit.
[02:48:22.532 --> 02:48:25.353]  The economy is going to go into this dragflation.
[02:48:27.655 --> 02:48:31.277]  People can't afford to live paycheck to paycheck.
[02:48:31.657 --> 02:48:36.621]  $40 billion and everyone voted for that.
[02:48:37.842 --> 02:48:48.603]   And big mouth, belly head, Nothing of a guy that's never worked a day in his life and sucking off the whole public thing his whole life.
[02:48:49.263 --> 02:48:50.865]  Bernie Sanders, right?
[02:48:53.206 --> 02:48:54.527]  He's not for peace.
[02:48:54.768 --> 02:48:55.788]  He's a liar.
[02:48:56.769 --> 02:48:58.690]  He supported a lot of wars.
[02:48:58.991 --> 02:49:01.913]  He's a lying piece of crap.
[02:49:04.775 --> 02:49:08.218]  We should always have a debate, he says.
[02:49:09.244 --> 02:49:13.927]  But the problem is that Ukraine is in the middle of a very intense war right now.
[02:49:14.748 --> 02:49:16.329]  I think every day counts.
[02:49:17.370 --> 02:49:23.534]  And I think we have to respond as strongly and as vigorously as we can.
[02:49:24.475 --> 02:49:27.457]  OK, fat boy, go respond.
[02:49:28.277 --> 02:49:28.898]  That's right.
[02:49:29.458 --> 02:49:34.181]  Get all dressed up in your military drag and go lead the charge.
[02:49:34.542 --> 02:49:37.684]  No, you're talking about stealing our money.
[02:49:39.372 --> 02:49:44.697]  And ramping up the war as you couldn't fight your way out of a paper bag!
[02:49:45.417 --> 02:49:51.362]  If they had a paper bag big enough to put over your fat, slobby body!
[02:49:53.144 --> 02:49:54.545]  It's a freak show!
[02:49:55.065 --> 02:49:56.727]  Grow up, everybody!
[02:49:57.207 --> 02:49:58.388]  Look at their faces.
[02:49:59.089 --> 02:50:00.350]  Listen to their words.
[02:50:01.771 --> 02:50:03.152]  How about their actions?
[02:50:05.014 --> 02:50:07.075]  They're leading us to World War III!
[02:50:10.455 --> 02:50:11.135]  You got it?
[02:50:13.836 --> 02:50:15.836]  You got it?
[02:50:15.836 --> 02:50:23.435]  If we don't unite for peace, it's over.
[02:50:23.641 --> 02:50:26.662]  I don't care what goes on between Russia and Ukraine.
[02:50:27.382 --> 02:50:28.823]  It's not my business.
[02:50:30.524 --> 02:50:33.045]  My country's falling apart over here.
[02:50:34.338 --> 02:50:46.586]  Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, warned us that the military-industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of the scientists, sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[02:50:47.626 --> 02:50:52.429]  War after war after war after war as this country goes down the crapper.
[02:50:53.530 --> 02:50:56.192]  Oh, the Russians must be heartbroken.
[02:50:56.712 --> 02:50:58.253]  McDonald's made it official.
[02:50:58.773 --> 02:51:03.176]  Now they're pulling out of Russia.
[02:51:04.645 --> 02:51:05.025]  Yeah.
[02:51:05.665 --> 02:51:07.946]  As I said, they should force them to stay there.
[02:51:08.526 --> 02:51:11.927]  This way, they'll be too fat to fight like the Americans.
[02:51:12.247 --> 02:51:14.467]  The blimp society of the world.
[02:51:15.287 --> 02:51:18.048]  Look at the crap everybody's shoving down their mouths.
[02:51:19.268 --> 02:51:21.349]  Oh, and Starbucks is leaving there, too.
[02:51:21.909 --> 02:51:24.910]  How can you drink that stuff, Marron?
[02:51:27.370 --> 02:51:28.370]  Bitters can be.
[02:51:29.850 --> 02:51:36.850]  That's the news?
[02:51:36.850 --> 02:51:39.930]  We better unite and you better support InfoWars.
[02:51:40.693 --> 02:51:49.236]  And of course, if you want to know what in the world is going on, what it means and what's next and what to do, you're going to want to subscribe to the Trends Journal.
[02:51:50.076 --> 02:51:54.357]  We're putting out a magazine like there's nothing, nothing in the world comes close to it.
[02:51:54.597 --> 02:51:57.238]  We're doing everything we can to give you the best we can.
[02:51:58.038 --> 02:51:59.539]  We're going back to the markets.
[02:51:59.999 --> 02:52:06.040]   No surprise, as fake Fed head Powell was saying, Oh, inflation's only temporary.
[02:52:06.060 --> 02:52:07.280]  Then it was transitory.
[02:52:07.720 --> 02:52:12.141]  And then, of course, we got that guy Rachel Levin over there playing the health minister of the United States.
[02:52:12.501 --> 02:52:14.202]  Maybe he made it transgender-tory.
[02:52:15.082 --> 02:52:16.143]  We said it was real.
[02:52:16.603 --> 02:52:18.343]  We said what the implications would be.
[02:52:19.323 --> 02:52:21.424]  You see what's going on with housing sales now?
[02:52:22.124 --> 02:52:24.845]  You see what's going on in the office commercial sector?
[02:52:24.664 --> 02:52:35.064]  Do you know how bad this is going to be?
[02:52:35.064 --> 02:52:39.343]  The S&P 500 almost went into bear territory.
[02:52:39.343 --> 02:52:49.343]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[02:52:41.719 --> 02:52:42.699]  That means it's down almost 20%.
[02:52:42.839 --> 02:52:46.280]  Other popped up the markets today, but they're rigged.
[02:52:46.960 --> 02:52:48.841]  Everything called a plunge protection team.
[02:52:48.861 --> 02:52:49.481]  Isn't that nice?
[02:52:50.241 --> 02:52:51.522]  How about the rigging team?
[02:52:52.662 --> 02:52:53.662]  By the banksters.
[02:52:55.023 --> 02:52:56.543]  This thing is going to go down big.
[02:52:57.023 --> 02:52:58.203]  It's going to go down hard.
[02:52:58.724 --> 02:53:01.024]  And it's going to it is going down fast.
[02:53:03.185 --> 02:53:12.281]   You had You had households are now paying $5,000 a year for gasoline.
[02:53:14.061 --> 02:53:21.644]  The Dow had its biggest drop since things went down bad when things were collapsing in 2020.
[02:53:23.165 --> 02:53:24.606]  It's one after another.
[02:53:25.686 --> 02:53:26.466]  And it's global.
[02:53:27.047 --> 02:53:30.748]  Britain's inflation rate, 40 year high it surged to.
[02:53:32.941 --> 02:53:44.644]  Again, you're seeing the Nasdaq having a dot-com bust, like they did back then, that we had forecast in the Trends Journal in October 1999.
[02:53:44.704 --> 02:53:46.504]  We said it would crash by the second quarter of 2000.
[02:53:48.144 --> 02:53:55.806]  I forecast the 1987 market crash, the Asian currency crisis, and took out the domain name, the Panic of 08 in 2007.
[02:53:58.066 --> 02:54:03.259]   We are headed for an economic crisis Beyond the worst that anybody could imagine.
[02:54:04.099 --> 02:54:09.041]  And as I keep saying, when all else fails, they take you to war.
[02:54:10.021 --> 02:54:11.102]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:54:11.542 --> 02:54:16.984]  Everybody's forgotten the disaster of the Afghan war and the pullout.
[02:54:17.844 --> 02:54:21.326]  Now it's just hate Russia, more weapons of death.
[02:54:24.347 --> 02:54:25.267]  It's a freak show.
[02:54:26.188 --> 02:54:27.788]  Right in front of everybody's eyes.
[02:54:28.568 --> 02:54:29.629]  Support InfoWars.
[02:54:30.370 --> 02:54:31.331]  We'll see you next week.
[02:54:31.831 --> 02:54:32.831]  Thank you.
[02:54:32.831 --> 02:54:43.110]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have had quite a run here at InfoWars.
[02:54:43.110 --> 02:54:49.190]   We've had a huge, huge effect when it comes to the fight against the globalists.
[02:54:49.190 --> 02:54:51.510]  And we've changed the world together.
[02:54:51.510 --> 02:54:54.510]   And I want to thank you for all you've done over the years with your prayers, your word
[02:54:54.510 --> 02:55:00.471]   of mouth, and shopping with us and supporting us while at the same time getting great products
[02:55:00.471 --> 02:55:01.911]  and then fullwarrestore.com.
[02:55:01.911 --> 02:55:03.030]  (dramatic music)
[02:55:02.937 --> 02:55:21.420]   But now because of supply chain breakdowns, and now because of all the Democratic Party-funded lawsuits, and the slanted nature of those attacks, We are matched out and pushed up against the wall, just like America's pushed up against the wall.
[02:55:21.721 --> 02:55:22.622]  And we're being bullied.
[02:55:22.642 --> 02:55:28.649]  We're being brutalized by the special interests that want to get through us to be able to get to you.
[02:55:28.729 --> 02:55:37.507]   So if we put today's live show headline up on screen for TV viewers, And ask the question, did Alex Jones Infowars declare bankruptcy?
[02:55:38.447 --> 02:55:39.487]  Tune in and learn the truth.
[02:55:39.608 --> 02:56:06.156]   If you scroll down in that live show feed today, you'll find a subsection that's on InfowarsStore.com, where when you click on it, it takes you to a subpage And InfoWarsTore.com, where you can make a $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 one-time donation, or you can sign up for a recurring donation cancel any time.
[02:56:06.857 --> 02:56:15.202]  But this is the time in the fight for freedom to understand they're going to take everything from you if you don't start spending time and energy in the fight.
[02:56:15.502 --> 02:56:19.184]  And I'm not talking to regular listeners that have supported us over the years and done a great job.
[02:56:19.444 --> 02:56:34.999]   I'm talking to new listeners or occasional listeners You need to understand this is a serious situation we're in and you need to put skin in the game financially to keep operations on the air like Infowars.
[02:56:35.439 --> 02:56:42.982]  Think of the millions of people that learned about ivermectin and zinc and vitamin D and hydroxychloroquine alone from this show.
[02:56:43.342 --> 02:56:47.744]  Think about the pedophile drag queen story times that have been exposed and stopped by this broadcast.
[02:56:48.524 --> 02:56:53.448]  Think about our border reports exposing the human smuggling that triggered congressional investigations.
[02:56:54.228 --> 02:56:56.750]  Think about our anti-war reporting.
[02:56:56.870 --> 02:57:02.054]  Think about our 9-11 in Bohemian Grove and our reporting on the globalist, the occult.
[02:57:02.354 --> 02:57:09.980]  I mean, to try to list our exposure of fluoride in the water and atrazine and the attack on our children with the whole transgender cult.
[02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:15.664]  Think about everything we've been through together and just imagine Infowars not being there.
[02:57:16.653 --> 02:57:27.037]  So I want to ask you to go to infowarestore.com and every day during the live show, under the live show feed, we'll have a link to it as well where you can donate and we can buy products.

[02:57:45.247 --> 02:57:47.868]  Because we can't sit there and pay for the larger inventory.
[02:57:47.908 --> 02:57:48.689]  We just can't do it.
[02:57:49.149 --> 02:57:50.509]  So, one-of-a-kind shirts.

[02:58:36.519 --> 02:58:37.600]  I'm counting on you.
